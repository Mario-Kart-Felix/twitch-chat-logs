[1:01:14] <yourliteraldog> Sounds not diffrent from what you normaly do
[1:01:15] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> "Hates scary games, bout to play a scary game..." - Pat logic
[1:01:17] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt would you say you enjoy the occasional scary game but game after game is a bit draining?
[1:01:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Let the shitstorm remain in the past, like a beloved sitcom.
[1:01:22] <RickSaintRiot> but as you say, sometimes the shitstorm helps you realize you're gay
[1:01:23] <%ssjklyco> Aren't you doing a scary anxious game right now?
[1:01:23] <koozie09> but you got to do it with your super best friends 😏

[1:19:42] <%Piemono> You can just have bad options
[1:19:43] <pth88> man you wanna dig some graves after a plane crash?
[1:19:43] <RickSaintRiot> You have to bury them shallowly. Bodies don't decompose in deserts.
[1:19:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> No time to dig deep, gotta survive
[1:19:45] <%heartlesshealer> until sandstone
[1:19:45] <Ipsenscastle> it's probably not sand all the way down

[1:19:58] <%AncelDeLambert> the person who did the burying clearly doesn't understand WHY we bury people
[1:19:58] <%crimsonharvest> pat they are starving and waterless why do you think its shallow
[1:19:59] <%nofestu2> you ever dig a hole Pat?
[1:19:59] <dinnydanny777> Sand moves around a lot so it would be hand to dig

[1:21:39] <%donkymagooterson> you are frying like an egg on a hot stone
[1:21:39] <ThirdPersonPhil> Came with the pregnancy
[1:21:40] <TrashbagZombie> The sound of your SKIN BOILING
[1:21:41] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> the sound stops when you're in the shade.
[1:21:41] <Giztech> her head shadow doesn't move lol
[1:21:41] <@SoFarFetched> Think the boiling noise is letting you know you're under the sun
[1:21:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat that's a sun dial.
[1:21:42] <+BusterRepukken> the game literally told you to stay out of the sun
[1:21:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt that sound is your skin boiling off
[1:21:43] <%Dakuu75> WAIT... is the sound only when your in the SUN????
[1:21:44] <hot_take_jake> Is this made by the Dark Descent/Soma team?
[1:21:44] <+Pookiedaexzile> Why she Gotta Omnitrix
[1:21:45] <+The_Protagonist> MAXIMUM SPOOP thepro95Alice thepro95Alice thepro95Alice
[1:21:46] <penitentpendant> Eldritch Wrist watches are good! They work after plane crashes!
[1:21:46] <marshalmorphino2> No cooking in the shade
[1:21:47] <gamewarden92> Fight the sun
[1:21:47] <Prevot> isn't that Ben 10's thingy?
[1:21:48] <+twohitgood> it's opposite amnesia. you avoid the light instead of the dark.
[1:21:49] <+Tahstachio> It was your skin baking
[1:21:49] <+trashcansan> OMG YOU'RE GOING TO WHERE DANIEL WAS IN THE FIRST GAME
[1:21:49] <%walternatorz> Doesn't everyone have an eldritch item?
[1:21:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE SUN IS A DEADLY LASER
[1:21:49] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt The sound is supposed to be you cooking in the sun. It's honestly kinda terrible lmao
[1:21:49] <KnightAsteran> the sound is a really over the top way of saying you're being overheated
[1:21:50] <%machshop> grippe sou
[1:21:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> This Bitch Ben 10 bruh
[1:21:53] <+pectusumbra> What, I have a cthulu pocket watch myself

[1:21:55] <PirateMike_> Patrick a une énorme bite
[1:21:58] <RickSaintRiot> I think they're leading you with shade instead, which is fascinating. @Bigyanno
[1:21:59] <ShiningAxis> it's an eldritch sunburn
[1:21:59] <%heartlesshealer> PAT D:
[1:21:59] <%AncelDeLambert> so have I...
[1:21:59] <%KiryujiKazamoto> huggExcellent huggExcellent
[1:22:01] <marshalmorphino2> The omnitrix
[1:22:03] <thelonechris> That's because your ears melted off
[1:22:03] <%Piemono> @CommanderSqueaks Yeah but it takes awhile to go through a human body, plenty of time to figure out what to do
[1:22:04] <+BallerSwagBro9k> telling u would be spoilers
[1:22:05] <%optimasmaximas> pat.....
[1:22:05] <zmuno> !uptime
[1:22:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 22m.
[1:22:05] <Bigyanno> JE ME PEEPEE C'EST BON
[1:22:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Francais dans le desert
[1:22:09] <%Frost_Quill> It seems like she's been here for a WHILE, but doesn't remember???
[1:22:10] <%donkymagooterson> it ain't easy being ginger
[1:22:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> 3rd Degree is skin being actually on fire.
[1:22:12] <%KiryujiKazamoto> psaPat
[1:22:12] <+Tahstachio> CRAZY TALK
[1:22:12] <%Beough> first it was the like insect cracking sound in The Dark Descent, NOW IT'S BOILING SKIN WHAT IS WITH THE ASMR IN AMNESIA GAMES
[1:22:12] <dinnydanny777> Sunburn causes skin to peel off anyway doesn't it?
[1:22:14] <splatty1> 3rd degree is skin sloughing territory
[1:22:14] <dots4eyes> Did your skin peel?
[1:22:15] <Parapattern> Third degree is down to like the bone
[1:22:15] <ssks123> 3rd degree is permanent damage i think
[1:22:15] <+The_Protagonist> I got a 3rd degree oil burn and it didn't even sound that strong
[1:22:15] <$Wurmspawn> The sound went away when you went into the shadow. Sooo, you're little boiling? That's a bit much game.
[1:22:16] <+AXL808> that's a Pat degree burn
[1:22:16] <+GingerStrawhat> I'm another Pasty Red Head, I feel your pain Pat
[1:22:16] <%captain_thickthighs> Does anything good happen to the the french in a desert?
[1:22:17] <Prevot> wow I'm so glad I'm not a ginger
[1:22:17] <+BallerSwagBro9k> 3RD DEGREE IS BIG LIFETIME SCAR
[1:22:18] <hot_take_jake> Sun poisoning is fun 10/10 would recommend
[1:22:18] <CrimsonGargoyle> "it was cool" quite the opposite Kappa
[1:22:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> 3rd degree is like numb and pale and to the bone
[1:22:18] <$Afterman_> 3rd degree would ufck your nerves up im p sure
[1:22:19] <+mccf> woolieS woolieT woolieF woolieU
[1:22:19] <+twohitgood> your skin can peel with first degree. second degree is blisters.
[1:22:19] <%AncelDeLambert> I got sunburned so bad once my skin scabbed
[1:22:20] <Ipsenscastle> third degree sunburn would be like flesh melting
[1:22:21] <RickSaintRiot> The sound is a bit much.
[1:22:22] <%royb2> 3rd degree means skin transfer
[1:22:23] <dirtsnake01> painful AND cool
[1:22:23] <KaiserMario> #
[1:22:24] <%mornerboi> second degree sunburns are agonizing, I had one when I was like 11 and thought I was going to die
[1:22:24] <%notgarza> So white lmao
[1:22:25] <%nofestu2> I got a big blister on my ear once
[1:22:26] <+worldbrand> i *still* have a sandal tan from june
[1:22:26] <leinadtonu> third degree could kill you pat
[1:22:28] <missingangle> Oh I did that on a cruise once and wanted to die.
[1:22:28] <DracaenaLeaf> Sun blisters are no joke, had them on my shoulders :(
[1:22:29] <Lajong_z> i get that every summer lel
[1:22:29] <%the22cstomp> 3rd degree is you have to get grafts
[1:22:30] <dredshift> A third degree sun burn would require standing in a spot of solar radiation
[1:22:30] <+mel0dica> "it was cuz it hwurt"
[1:22:30] <+lilgarbage_> A very old man move
[1:22:33] <%crimsonharvest> 3rd degree is excised cooked tissue if you dont die of shock or sepsis
[1:22:34] <marshalmorphino2> Oh Pat
[1:22:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> 3rd Degree is your skin actually on fire, you didn't get a 3rd Degree burn.
[1:22:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> 3rd Degree is how you get a Zuko scar
[1:22:36] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, third degree is actual fucking melting, Pat
[1:22:37] <+Teintstein> just white people shit
[1:22:38] <+AXL808> i wake up screaming too! but for other reasons
[1:22:40] <+GingerStrawhat> Mine came after a day of being at an amusment park
[1:22:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> Pat Said that shit with so much confidence, like a doctor told
[1:22:43] <%donkymagooterson> yeah sounds like a great day
[1:22:43] <%king_wragles> Third degree would be blisters and sores actually
[1:22:44] <%Jekado> yeah 3rd degree burns would mean permanant scars
[1:22:45] <%Frost_Quill> I think the game is implying she's been here a while but her memory problems keep making her forget?
[1:22:46] <JetpackMcQuack> a box
[1:22:48] <%Dakuu75> ok... I thought that sound turned off, jsut because she walked in the shade but, I guess not
[1:22:50] <leinadtonu> Sonic tried to know ok you?
[1:22:51] <%captain_thickthighs> Sun burn? Laughs in Melanin
[1:22:51] <Psyramics> how can it be evil? its got a happy face on it!
[1:22:53] <%AnIcedCoffee> Second degree sunburn is boils, I got it when I was like 15
[1:22:53] <JetpackMcQuack> evil box
[1:22:55] <PirateMike_> I once got a big bad sun burn on my back while in the army and got yelled at for damaging Military Equipment
[1:22:56] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> a contailer is an evil thing huh?
[1:22:58] <hot_take_jake> Where's Damn Daniel?
[1:22:58] <%RC_S3kshun8> @PatStaresAt 3rd degree is like muscle level/can see bones, Like you got Xenomorph blood on you

[1:23:21] <Wyrmsblood> Thank god for subtitles
[1:23:21] <Bigyanno> Being shot or sold is preferable to dying of thirst. Dying of thirst sounds like the worst death
[1:23:24] <%AncelDeLambert> quick, put the corn in the bowl and then cry!!

[1:24:42] <penitentpendant> Already had a child
[1:24:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat confused by human, not furry, baby
[1:24:47] <Bigyanno> Why did people settle near deserts? why not just leave and go somewhere with less actively hostile living conditions?
[1:24:50] <dots4eyes> Is this...a Dark Descent? Kappa
[1:24:50] <RetroCop87> SORA
[1:24:52] <RickSaintRiot> c'est possible.

[1:25:05] <Chaos_kun> The Pilar Men
[1:25:08] <%Dakuu75> Salim, Salut Sa'va~
[1:25:09] <RickSaintRiot> It's funny, they're using the <<French quotations.>>
[1:25:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> SALIM is not doing well.
[1:25:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> oof that looks a bad wound
[1:25:11] <+A0N33> I don't think you can fix a hole that big
[1:25:12] <DianaTheAscian> thats a dead man
[1:25:14] <penitentpendant> That's a rough stitch
[1:25:14] <Cactuskris> you time travels so bad
[1:25:15] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> threaded together like scarecrows face in Arkham Knight
[1:25:15] <Guardiansaiyan> @dots4eyes smooth

[1:25:16] <%toastybites> where that flex tape at
[1:25:16] <marshalmorphino2> @bigyanno it might be a crappy place to live, but it belongs to someone
[1:25:17] <%heartlesshealer> stitching won't help that
[1:25:18] <%ssjklyco> Gotta stich up her baby hole
[1:25:20] <%donkymagooterson> catgut
[1:25:22] <boomstickery> surgeons dont stitch liek that, if the thread rips they all come out
[1:25:23] <+BallerSwagBro9k> 1920s stitch tech
[1:25:23] <cyb3r_demon> droooooooog
[1:25:26] <godzookylives> should have learned how to sew
[1:25:26] <%CalderGaming> GOD AS MY WITNESS HE'S BROKEN IN HALF

[1:25:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Artistic representation
[1:25:49] <%fairore> @michingmallecho I think it's "all that I see"
[1:25:49] <Visorak6> artistic representation pat
[1:25:50] <%machshop> he was hiding
[1:25:51] <Thewoodentree> Cuz he romantic
[1:25:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's Art Pat.
[1:25:51] <%mornerboi> crawling out from under the bushes to get in some different bushes
[1:25:53] <RickSaintRiot> A racial law? or maybe an Islamic law?
[1:25:54] <%nofestu2> Be gay do crimes
[1:25:54] <%heartlesshealer> love transcends law? Deep South???
[1:25:55] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Pretty sure this was during a time where it was illegal for British and French people to be in love
[1:25:55] <+BallerSwagBro9k> ONI CHAN?
[1:25:56] <+worldbrand> he's being eaten by them
[1:25:56] <dots4eyes> Hmmm...
[1:25:57] <Ipsenscastle> he IS the bushes
[1:25:59] <+GingerStrawhat> It's a motif damn it!
[1:26:00] <%MechArch> his torso is missing
[1:26:00] <marshalmorphino2> Laws of attraction?
[1:26:01] <%Revan175757> cause Love transcendes Law
[1:26:02] <penitentpendant> Why are bushes in the house, next to the window?
[1:26:05] <thetrashman_sc> IDIOT
[1:26:06] <Wyrmsblood> These interludes are a bit much
[1:26:08] <+jakb001> Hey, long time fan. Just wanted to say you're super cool and I wished I watched the streams. I mainly listen to the podcast. You probably won't see this, but just thanks for being a funny and cool dude. Keep it up!
[1:26:09] <%shiplord13> Sure
[1:26:11] <+vicar_anat> GASP
[1:26:12] <+worldbrand> it still is
[1:26:12] <%arcielardor> he's by her bedside
[1:26:12] <Mr_Strut> probably
[1:26:14] <DidacticTactic> yeah right now
[1:26:17] <+BallerSwagBro9k> ***
[1:26:17] <%TrafficCohen> In like the 1500s maybe
[1:26:18] <RickSaintRiot> It is around the turn of the century, anti-miscengenation laws were all the rage.
[1:26:19] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt I dont think Saliem is british
[1:26:19] <+Tahstachio> still is
[1:26:20] <marshalmorphino2> Looks like a hallucination, maybe drug indicted?
[1:26:21] <%heartlesshealer> oooh, non-citizenry marriage
[1:26:21] <dinnydanny777> I don't think so
[1:26:21] <%arcielardor> that's wallpaper
[1:26:22] <+GingerStrawhat> I mean the 30s when everything was illeagal
[1:26:22] <%Revan175757> Probably some parent shit
[1:26:23] <ToneBacas> IRL?
[1:26:23] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Pat no
[1:26:24] <marshalmorphino2> *induced
[1:26:24] <akibanoman> british?
[1:26:25] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> British people getting love should never be legal
[1:26:26] <boomstickery> no, might be some colonial stuff
[1:26:26] <$heyitskev_> Those wounds, they could only have been made by the deadliest of French monsters: The Rabid Wolverine BENOIT
[1:26:27] <+Rose_Silvers> never stopped
[1:26:28] <cyb3r_demon> only winners do drugs kids
[1:26:28] <+macr434> I got a third-degree sunburn and my skin turned black and purple
[1:26:29] <PirateMike_> Salim is such a vagin
[1:26:30] <Ipsenscastle> I'm from the UK, can confirm it's the death penalty
[1:26:33] <%crimsonharvest> I also wish that
[1:26:34] <+trashcansan> El no sabe LUL
[1:26:34] <hearingthenseeing> it still is
[1:26:35] <%anticrust> One of them is probably algierian
[1:26:36] <godzookylives> @worldbrand Kappa
[1:26:37] <%donkymagooterson> unless you're a king
[1:26:37] <+Kurt_0> Yes every time
[1:26:42] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:26:45] <+Rose_Silvers> the french don't deserve love
[1:26:48] <Visorak6> mining encampment in a desert oh boy
[1:26:48] <dinnydanny777> The British Kings and Queens literally were French so probably not
[1:26:50] <olm46> That's maps.
[1:26:50] <+lilgarbage_> frigg off with that
[1:26:52] <missingangle> Probably intentionally so, dude LUL
[1:26:52] <%mighty_max_t> Wait, is this game about Revengenetics?
[1:26:53] <+BallerSwagBro9k> They're both ALGERIAN Pat @patstaresat
[1:26:53] <RickSaintRiot> it's useful if you're a miner i bet
[1:26:54] <marshalmorphino2> Nice map
[1:26:57] <+twohitgood> mind goblins...to spend the matches or not.
[1:26:59] <Thewoodentree> What is the gurglin in the background?
[1:27:00] <Goodvibes99508> here is a super detailed map that's really tiny
[1:27:01] <%Revan175757> Conserve matches Pat
[1:27:02] <%fairore> @rose_silvers wow

[1:27:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Flasks can carry water, pat.
[1:27:46] <PirateMike_> My Name is Michael Caine

[1:29:31] <%heartlesshealer> oh
[1:29:31] <+lazysaiyajin> damn
[1:29:33] <TrashbagZombie> Oh, she dead
[1:29:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Good
[1:29:37] <+lethallylactic> That's one ded baby
[1:29:38] <Chaos_kun> Where is the gameplay?
[1:29:40] <%KiryujiKazamoto> huggDead
[1:29:40] <%heartlesshealer> rip child
[1:29:42] <marshalmorphino2> DED
[1:29:42] <missingangle> Just assume everyone's dead. It's easier
[1:29:42] <cyb3r_demon> that kid is the monster
[1:29:43] <%shiplord13> Probably which is sad
[1:29:43] <Grandma_Amari> Dead probably yeah
[1:29:44] <%AdamElJefe> Everyone's dead
[1:29:45] <Taconotz> Frictional actually didnt do the obvious stuff with this
[1:29:47] <%AdamElJefe> I'm dead

[1:29:54] <RetroCop87> Or she's INVISIBLE
[1:29:55] <Skatedeandre> which would explain why they took the monkey doll
[1:29:56] <penitentpendant> Having the child's stuffed animal on hand is not a good sign for the kid being alive
[1:29:57] <Taconotz> @Chaos_kun Game is still starting, plenty of stealth and puzzles later
[1:29:58] <olm46> The monster is dead before we even started, nice.
[1:30:00] <sakeydo> Why did this start with her in the plane if shes remembering the stuff she already did after the crash? Confused.
[1:30:00] <+BallerSwagBro9k> DESTROY THE CHILD LUL
[1:30:00] <hearingthenseeing> The more beautiful the baby, the deader it is
[1:30:01] <RickSaintRiot> actually i think everyone is a live and they're all perfectly fine :)

[1:30:17] <Skatedeandre> Thanks for the KPOPheart @kashi_nin
[1:30:22] <+Evitron1> it's fuckin amnesia dog, this IS the gameplay
[1:30:23] <RickSaintRiot> this crash is nbd. they're all gonna throw you a party at the end of the game

[1:30:26] <cyb3r_demon> its called amnesia...she has amnesia lol
[1:30:34] <%Meltdown547> Him listing a year with the date has some implications.
[1:30:34] <SatoruMasamune> Okay, so at what point in the game does all of France fall into the sea because the world has realized that all things French are useless at best?
[1:30:36] <thetrashman_sc> 😟
[1:30:36] <penitentpendant> Sounds like the husband is dead too
[1:30:38] <RickSaintRiot> it's your birthday. they love you very very very very very very much

[1:30:41] <valriot> monkaS
[1:30:42] <Taconotz> @TheEmperorsEyebrows You cant the walk speed to be slow for stealth purposes. Sprint is for when you need to haul ass
[1:30:44] <Bigyanno> Oh good at least there is a creature
[1:30:45] <Thewoodentree> This is some Mountains of Madness shit
[1:30:48] <%Jekado> wait did he leave Tasi for dead?

[1:31:08] <%crimsonharvest> hay una creatura
[1:31:09] <skyentombment> CREATURE, RETREATURE
[1:31:10] <marshalmorphino2> Task has amnesia
[1:31:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @garbagequeenellie Kill it for that sick pearl
[1:31:15] <Taconotz> People in the chat, give this game 1 hour for the set up to be done. It really clicks into place
[1:31:17] <Parapattern> The Creature Mine is better than France
[1:31:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Watch Pat hoard all of the matches for the entire game.
[1:31:22] <KnightAsteran> I can't see shit
[1:31:22] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Btw this story is very sad and depressing just fyi
[1:31:28] <%WhereIsWill> horrible cthulhu monstar incomin
[1:31:33] <marshalmorphino2> Turns out Tasi was/is la creature
[1:31:35] <PirateMike_> Was the first amnesia lovecraftian?
[1:31:38] <malletman241> more like very boring and drawn out
[1:31:39] <+mel0dica> no thats fire m'am
[1:31:40] <Wyrmsblood> ARE YOU SCARED OF CREATURE
[1:31:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> And who lit that fire?
[1:31:42] <cyb3r_demon> at least she's not alone she has the creature to keep her company
[1:31:42] <Taconotz> @BallerSwagBro9k Can't be worse than Soma
[1:31:42] <RickSaintRiot> yes
[1:31:45] <Cactuskris> yes
[1:31:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @GeneralSCPatton The protag coulda taken that thing on foot, that's my headcanon
[1:31:47] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @piratemike_ VERY
[1:31:50] <$joylent_blue> yeah the game starts slow, just give a minute chat
[1:31:50] <+vicar_anat> what if you need to keep all the matches for the true ending?
[1:31:54] <marshalmorphino2> Who started the fire?
[1:31:55] <%AncelDeLambert> zut alor!
[1:31:58] <ssks123> is this set in that tomb Daniel found in the first Amnesia?

[1:32:17] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @taconotz true that game screwed me up
[1:32:20] <RickSaintRiot> Mon dieu! Ma foi! Zut alors! Sacre bleu!
[1:32:21] <+duskr2r> is it a direct sequel to dark descent or can you just go without knowing much of what happens?

[1:32:33] <ManfredA> @joylent_blue whaddaya mean games have things like intros and "building suspense"
[1:32:33] <Thewoodentree> Fuckin pored gasoline on those sticks
[1:32:37] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> the match is both too much light and not enough light
[1:32:39] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> how
[1:32:39] <%heartlesshealer> okay, so matches are timed torches
[1:32:39] <%YakumoYomi> Darkness...imprisoning me. All that I see...

[1:32:42] <+TheOpinionater> those bugs are HUGE
[1:32:42] <penitentpendant> I do like matches can light multiple sources
[1:32:42] <gamewarden92> Eat it, you need protein
[1:32:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> you will have to eat bugs to survive.

[1:32:49] <+BallerSwagBro9k> ANXIETY BEGINS NOW
[1:32:49] <+Orenjevel> i dont like how rat-like those bugs are
[1:32:50] <penitentpendant> Rather than one light source one tinderbox
[1:32:50] <cyb3r_demon> eat the bug
[1:32:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Thanks for the KPOPselfie @peanutprophet !
[1:32:53] <Wyrmsblood> Holy shit those beetles are huge
[1:32:53] <%Frost_Quill> Oh we're totally gonna learn that Salim or Tasi accidentally killed the baby or some shit.
[1:32:54] <%TrafficCohen> Wait, I'm not understanding. How long was the french girl in the plane after the crash?
[1:32:56] <+duskr2r> @Taconotz cool, thanks!
[1:33:03] <butthurtdave> Wait, this isn't Doom
[1:33:03] <HotMafia81> Twitch straight-up quit showing me an ad halfway through
[1:33:04] <%heartlesshealer> move more slowly with match
[1:33:05] <%WhereIsWill> sanity meter yeyeye
[1:33:05] <Taconotz> This game doesn't have gameovers by the way, its WAAAAAY worse
[1:33:06] <%valhallandoates> is there that awful teeth grinding effect
[1:33:08] <cyb3r_demon> the only good bug is a dead bug oo rah
[1:33:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TrafficCohen It's called a mystery.
[1:33:10] <+TheOpinionater> Don't you just love resource management in horror games
[1:33:11] <%MechArch> psaBig spooks
[1:33:11] <CappuccinoGuil> If you move too much, the match goes out? DOPE
[1:33:12] <marshalmorphino2> @yakumoyomi since the game has different endings I’m guessing one of the is Tasi was the monster all along
[1:33:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @crimsonharvest I want a horror game where clipping through the map is a secret intended path that leads to non-euclidean bullshit and the true ending
[1:33:17] <RickSaintRiot> @TrafficCohen wouldn't you like to knowwww
[1:33:18] <dinnydanny777> Bugsnax, imprisoning me, all that I see
[1:33:19] <Visorak6> thats the point
[1:33:20] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[1:33:21] <%Frost_Quill> @TrafficCohen It's implied she has memory problems and she's been here for a WHILE.
[1:33:22] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> yeah but muh sanity

[1:33:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love that she says it.
[1:33:45] <RickSaintRiot> I love the diagetic interface
[1:33:46] <%crimsonharvest> that makes sense @GeneralSCPatton why should the elder gods be defeated in normal space on mortal terms
[1:33:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ooga shacka, ooga ooga, ooga shacka
[1:33:49] <%shiplord13> Don't use them

[1:35:23] <+zsDirtyHarry> that is one way to bury the light
[1:35:25] <%shiplord13> Can we all agree that is slimy tentacles

[1:35:25] <%albret__einstrong> Pat going for the no torch challenge run

[1:35:27] <+lilgarbage_> *spider leg sounds*
[1:35:28] <+BusterRepukken> you missed the room,
[1:35:28] <%optimasmaximas> WAP
[1:35:29] <penitentpendant> Now the real question: Does reading stop time?
[1:35:30] <%heartlesshealer> do things still move in the reading time??? videoc1Omg
[1:35:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> It sounds like skittering bugs
[1:35:30] <+Tahstachio> god its like my house
[1:35:30] <+xKING_IRA> sounds like a good orgy
[1:35:31] <Bigyanno> sounds like Woolie's bathroom circa 2014, or so I've been led to believe
[1:35:32] <%Pappajimbo> missed the room
[1:35:33] <Taconotz> @CappuccinoGuil Yes I think
[1:35:33] <melonlolmelon> LOOK AROUND EVERYWHERE BEFORE MOVING ON just a tip luaLUL
[1:35:33] <%WhereIsWill> dat WAP
[1:35:33] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:35:34] <gamewarden92> *Sound of being felt up by tentacles*
[1:35:35] <+Orenjevel> good thing Protag has darkvision
[1:35:35] <+BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:35:36] <%AncelDeLambert> goddammit Paige
[1:35:39] <dinnydanny777> It sounds like bugs running across a keyboardv limesHmm
[1:35:40] <Wyrmsblood> Who the fuck is fingering a bowl of spaghetti
[1:35:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I think there's a cave pond somewhere
[1:35:43] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> god the ambient noises in this game are so horribly loud
[1:35:44] <cyb3r_demon> nice 0 deaths
[1:35:45] <thetrashman_sc> boobies
[1:35:45] <%Dylveryn> CRABS
[1:35:46] <Lajong_z> hes a genius
[1:35:46] <Taconotz> This feels like an area in DMC where you can buy moves
[1:35:49] <$joylent_blue> if your WAP sounds like that what the FUCK you doin'
[1:35:49] <stabbityrabbit> So her sanity is completely gone at this point.
[1:35:50] <theanora1> hard to hear the creepy shit over all the creepy shit
[1:35:50] <cyb3r_demon> lol
[1:35:51] <%YakumoYomi> Gawrsh, Sora
[1:35:51] <haitakaa> more like hear my pee
[1:35:56] <marshalmorphino2> Ahhhhh
[1:35:58] <marshalmorphino2> Relief
[1:35:59] <%Dakuu75> what a shitty plea
[1:36:04] <Bigyanno> That's a fucking Eekum Bokum mask
[1:36:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, you can take torches after you light them
[1:36:09] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> take a candle
[1:36:10] <+thegreenbenis> Booba statue
[1:36:10] <boomstickery> pat treat the matches like matches
[1:36:13] <%captain_thickthighs> Okay who was moisting it up in the cave?
[1:36:21] <Taconotz> @stabbityrabbit So sanity isn't a meter in this game, its more of a LOOOOONG term thing
[1:36:22] <%heartlesshealer> hit that idol for saves?
[1:36:22] <%YakumoYomi> E
[1:36:24] <$joylent_blue> now to stay here forever
[1:36:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> i assume each match be precious?
[1:36:29] <%heartlesshealer> or is it just a statue
[1:36:32] <RickSaintRiot> Uka Uka mask
[1:36:33] <cyb3r_demon> little spooky that you can lock that
[1:36:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> you can hide here. from your responsibilities.
[1:36:39] <penitentpendant> Nice that you can bar doors in case of monsters
[1:36:39] <BaronVonProlix> E
[1:36:41] <%salemthesalami> dont run with a match
[1:36:41] <%albret__einstrong> pat just use your night vision
[1:36:41] <%Fooguwu> PAT
[1:36:43] <%anticrust> PAT STOP WASTING MATCHES
[1:36:47] <Wyrmsblood> Back into the spaghetti darkness
[1:36:48] <Taconotz> God, the setup for this game is so good
[1:36:49] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, don't run with the matches
[1:36:50] <%king_wragles> @Zaphire_Saucypants yes very, actually
[1:36:50] <%Dakuu75> that room is probably where game journalists gave up
[1:36:51] <@SoFarFetched> Pat you can't run with matches it goes out f aster LUL
[1:36:51] <+lilgarbage_> hahahahaha
[1:36:51] <%jyeowa> INSTANTLY USE THE TWO MATCHES YEAHYEAHYEAH
[1:36:52] <missingangle> Geez, those matches don't last long at all on their own LUL
[1:36:53] <marshalmorphino2> At least it locks from the inside
[1:36:53] <%Frost_Quill> Doesn't even try to approach the idol thing.
[1:36:53] <%heartlesshealer> I like how pat ignored the match tooltip completely
[1:36:56] <%xXjuffelXx> But without the match is only wap sounds
[1:36:57] <+Orenjevel> then why spend match
[1:37:00] <boomstickery> daniel craig?
[1:37:00] <%albret__einstrong> local man wastes every match instantly
[1:37:02] <%Jekado> how does she read in the dark?
[1:37:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, running with matches causes matches to act like matches
[1:37:06] <melonlolmelon> I’m saying this so you can find a lantern thingy
[1:37:07] <BaronVonProlix> Adult
[1:37:11] <%anticrust> YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO USE THEM ON THE LIGHT SOURCES
[1:37:17] <$joylent_blue> grumped the match tutorial monkaS
[1:37:17] <bounty96hunter> It said earlier that moving a lot makes matches go out sooner.
[1:37:17] <Ipsenscastle> lol this paper zooming in and out like a face in Hotline Miami
[1:37:18] <%heartlesshealer> BABY <3
[1:37:19] <Cactuskris> this is a shitstorm episode
[1:37:19] <+redthebaron> has there been any spooks yet?
[1:37:20] <%ceremight> Do not move quickly with match. =/
[1:37:25] <boomstickery> and not run with them
[1:37:25] <%Darklord_417> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:37:26] <+TheNewZealandStory> why are these letters scattered about at random
[1:37:26] <Visorak6> YOU CAN SEE IN THE DARK
[1:37:27] <%YakumoYomi> You have to move slower when you have a match out, or they go out faster
[1:37:28] <%coreyyotto> just don't be blind
[1:37:30] <tolloponik> wow running fast makes the match go out quicker that's a neet touch
[1:37:31] <boomstickery> when it flickers stop
[1:37:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you can see well in the night.
[1:37:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> didn't you JUST say you can see better without them?
[1:37:33] <Taconotz> Dude your sanity is getting fucked the game isnt paused
[1:37:33] <penitentpendant> Running with matches extinguishes them quickly?
[1:37:34] <+lilgarbage_> Yo is that Mads
[1:37:36] <%shiplord13> You have already said you can see better in the dark
[1:37:36] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pat don't wanna slow dance in the daaaaarrrrkk
[1:37:38] <+Orenjevel> Pat you have darkvision
[1:37:40] <%anticrust> You see better in the dark but lose sanity
[1:37:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> No.
[1:37:41] <RickSaintRiot> Running causes to go out faster than walking, even though it's slow.
[1:37:42] <+xKING_IRA> pat its okay to be bad at games
[1:37:44] <tolloponik> no
[1:37:44] <%salemthesalami> dont run with them. it will put it out
[1:37:44] <missingangle> wha
[1:37:44] <%anticrust> No
[1:37:44] <Grandma_Amari> You said yourself you can see better without matches
[1:37:44] <%heartlesshealer> you never tested that
[1:37:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[1:37:46] <Visorak6> light = sanity restore, dark = see
[1:37:47] <Dwarven_Gaming> no.
[1:37:48] <%albret__einstrong> that's correct
[1:37:49] <%salemthesalami> way way faster
[1:37:49] <%anticrust> you will go further
[1:37:51] <+BallerSwagBro9k> no
[1:37:51] <%maskofmichael> Just don't think about it
[1:37:52] <%Garthunox> but moving at all puts out the match!
[1:37:53] <+Kiltedpunk> use the matches to stave off insanity
[1:37:54] <+thegreenbenis> YOU HAVE DARK VISION
[1:37:54] <Chaos_kun> That noise is super unpleasant
[1:37:54] <%Frost_Quill> You literally said you see better in the dark.
[1:37:55] <%albret__einstrong> matches are not for going to a to b
[1:37:55] <+thackattack00> no
[1:37:56] <%Revan175757> they lie Pat
[1:37:59] <+BallerSwagBro9k> PAT NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:38:01] <%walternatorz> think of matches as sanity restorers that work best at torches
[1:38:01] <+lethallylactic> D:
[1:38:02] <boomstickery> is that torch not portable?
[1:38:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Fuck you, Hank
[1:38:04] <wibbwobbler> somebody do the math
[1:38:05] <%albret__einstrong> matches are for rest spots
[1:38:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> If I remember original amnesia shit right, you need that the light for sanity. Pat, you done fucked up.
[1:38:08] <marshalmorphino2> Match goes out faster when you move
[1:38:09] <%anticrust> only run with no light
[1:38:09] <%heartlesshealer> dark = fear, but vision. Light = sane, but blind
[1:38:12] <+Orenjevel> Matches are more precious than sanity
[1:38:13] <brexdq> I'm gonna have to leave you soon gura starts playing amnesia soon
[1:38:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> "I see better without the match", "how can I see without the match" - Pat
[1:38:16] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> DOG
[1:38:17] <missingangle> Goddammit, this bitch is gonna lose her mind by the end of this
[1:38:18] <%Laecerelius> So much lube!
[1:38:21] <RickSaintRiot> I think sometimes you might miss the light sources UNLESS you light the torches
[1:38:24] <%Garthunox> oil
[1:38:30] <boomstickery> missed a page
[1:38:30] <%coreyyotto> save the matches until you're almost crazy
[1:38:31] <marshalmorphino2> Bad end for Pat then
[1:38:32] <RickSaintRiot> depends on your darkvision, ig
[1:38:35] <%umbypokochan> i light up for sanity every day
[1:38:35] <%nofestu2> Never know when you might need them
[1:38:39] <+thegreenbenis> Light torches, Jesus christ.

[1:39:46] <A_CD_By_Thomas> oh
[1:39:47] <stabbityrabbit> @Taconotz So is sanity more like a good vs. bad end thing in this game?
[1:39:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You hath died from disentary
[1:39:53] <%YakumoYomi> It's fine
[1:39:53] <ZeroCruz> Da baby asumes control

[1:40:08] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> why do people like these games again?
[1:40:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Memories, I assume
[1:40:09] <Taconotz> @stabbityrabbit from what I can tell yes
[1:40:09] <%shadowace2400> you a wendigo now
[1:40:09] <%Namaztak> in the original all sanity did was make you fall over and have a bout of tinnitus
[1:40:10] <+mccf> Is fear actually a real mechanic in this game and not a total lie like in the first game?
[1:40:12] <RickSaintRiot> I can't. I have the typhoid or the cholera!
[1:40:12] <jackeroff3> is this a newgrounds flash game?
[1:40:12] <AngryCaterpillar> No Talsi, you are the demons
[1:40:13] <%YakumoYomi> For the spookums
[1:40:13] <%Frost_Quill> Death or progress?
[1:40:14] <ThereIsNoJustice> jpgs are so scary
[1:40:15] <$joylent_blue> monkaS
[1:40:17] <SatoruMasamune> FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAR!! *jumps around like an asshole while doing weird spider shit*
[1:40:19] <CappuccinoGuil> @stabbityrabbit it's a health bar. You'll die if it goes too low. The lower it gets, the crazier things happen
[1:40:19] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> did they not make money from the first one?
[1:40:20] <%MidnightBurst12> low resolution = scary
[1:40:20] <+redthebaron> this is actually pretty normal in 1937
[1:40:20] <%anticrust> Worms
[1:40:22] <gustavozxd> the scariest of monsters, jpgs
[1:40:23] <+Orenjevel> imagine going crazy after 3 minutes in a dark cave because your matches went out
[1:40:24] <+TheNewZealandStory> can you brush the hair out of your eyes
[1:40:25] <valriot> Cthulhu go brr
[1:40:25] <%xXjuffelXx> jpeg the scariest format of the all
[1:40:25] <%YakumoYomi> It was
[1:40:27] <+thegreenbenis> Because you are in darkness too much. @PatStaresAt
[1:40:29] <%anticrust> it was
[1:40:30] <Ipsenscastle> devil trigger?
[1:40:30] <%Dakuu75> was one of those jpegs, chronos eating his kids? lol
[1:40:32] <RickSaintRiot> @TheEmperorsEyebrows gonna have to be more specific
[1:40:33] <s1rcuit> it had extras and needed an excuse to use them
[1:40:34] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt To be honest is there anything scarier then jpegs?
[1:40:35] <Bigyanno> YOU are the creature
[1:40:41] <melonlolmelon> Well this is amnesia luaLUL luaLUL
[1:40:42] <%anticrust> BUt also stop wasting the matches

[1:40:45] <Bigyanno> Calling it now YOU are the creature
[1:40:48] <stabbityrabbit> Great, so Pat is already locked into the bad end it seems.

[1:51:37] <dinnydanny777> As far as Hell goes this isn't so bad
[1:51:38] <Teras_ode> those were all names and terms from the first game yes?
[1:51:39] <%heartlesshealer> that's just how babies do
[1:51:40] <%KiryujiKazamoto> he's Z-targeting your colostomy bag
[1:51:41] <Grandma_Amari> The orb thing from Amnesia came from some desert expedition, right?
[1:51:43] <DensityD> fat dog
[1:51:48] <RickSaintRiot> A Machine for Pigs is in the same 'verse too, but it's not super interwoven

[1:51:53] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> good one Brennenburg

[1:52:24] <Kashi_Nin> cheer1500 SG-1 has ruined, forever, my ability to not immediately associate the phrase "gate builders" with anything else...
[1:52:26] <Kashi_Nin> Kashi_Nin's Cheer shared rewards to 25 others in Chat! 
[1:52:34] <RickSaintRiot> no, not the same guy. different name I think

[1:54:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Zaphire_Saucypants She has spent most likely days or weeks in the Desert, she hasn't had time to manicure.
[1:54:26] <%mighty_max_t> This seems a really cool concept/setting so far
[1:54:27] <Bigyanno> That is not dead which can in eternal slumber lie. And with strange eons even death may die

[2:01:28] <penitentpendant> I always forget how different Pat looks in this compared to actual Pat
[2:01:32] <%Jekado> i would think paige would be good against Karens at this point
[2:01:36] <Chaos_kun> Ye

[2:02:11] <mr_slaide> I don't think anyone can survive a Karen encounter.
[2:02:15] <%CalderGaming> @captain_thickthighs I know you mean well but I can say from experience that "have you tried yoga" as a suggestion for various bodily pains gets really old really fast
[2:02:16] <SatoruMasamune> When a Karen removes her mask, it's like Kenpachi taking off his eyepatch.
[2:02:21] <DensityD> pissing buddies
[2:02:21] <Chaos_kun> What if Karen is the true villain in Amnesia
[2:02:22] <%Jekado> Paige needs to learn the Smash punch for optimal anti preging
[2:02:23] <kingjames7789> yeah but she can go for the knees

[2:19:55] <%SWFanatic> snort
[2:19:56] <HotMafia81> Remember how Amnesia had like a big, open hub level, and puzzles, and a background narrative you could discover organically as you explored the map? That was nice.
[2:19:57] <BoneofMalkav> THE Time
[2:19:58] <DensityD> that one greek mother of the demigod hero was the first helicopter mom
[2:19:58] <PaPaSeppuku> helicopters are a government conspiracy
[2:20:00] <%g0atmeal> The first helicopter was in 1939
[2:20:01] <+Bulagne> The FW 61 was the first operational helicopter and flew in 1936
[2:20:01] <mr_slaide> It's VADER TIME!
[2:20:01] <%patriotrenegade> only a couple years
[2:20:01] <%walternatorz> 1939 was apparently the first helicipter
[2:20:01] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt Prototype Helecopters exisisted in Germany in the 30s and 40s

[2:20:37] <RickSaintRiot> Airships are super efficient.
[2:20:40] <%drabberfaun535> helicopters were invented in 1939
[2:20:40] <Chatterbox1991> People forget Nazi's invented choppers in the late 30s

[2:20:52] <bashful_bard> What a mansione
[2:20:52] <Bigyanno> He gave up like a typical Frenchman
[2:20:54] <soraabora> for a bit
[2:20:54] <%snow_bush> He died like a true frenchman, giving up.
[2:20:55] <+Pookiedaexzile> Nah
[2:20:55] <%Ynkubus_> attempts at helicopter like things has been a centuries old thing
[2:20:55] <arkv01> yeah
[2:20:56] <%g0atmeal> Have you ever watched a horror movie?
[2:20:56] <problemagic> depends on how pregnatr
[2:20:56] <silverira> next fall do a belly flop
[2:20:56] <%WhereIsWill> yes LUL
[2:20:57] <Goodvibes99508> her leg just fu king flew off
[2:20:57] <Visorak6> Yes
[2:20:57] <%rdark_ksu> yes
[2:20:57] <dinnydanny777> Yes
[2:20:58] <yourliteraldog> you dumb ass
[2:20:59] <penitentpendant> Yes, but it's more tiring compared to normal
[2:20:59] <DianaTheAscian> ..........
[2:21:00] <+GingerStrawhat> It's possible but very very unadvised
[2:21:03] <Badgerconda_> baby has built in airbags, pat.
[2:21:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> Prolly not
[2:21:03] <%Ner234> No you don't
[2:21:06] <HotMafia81> @kingjames7789 babby is greatest character in all of cinema
[2:21:06] <arkv01> this is not a stupid question
[2:21:06] <$Wnds> OhMyDog
[2:21:06] <stardustcrusad3r> my mom ran with me in her belly and my brains were scrambled
[2:21:07] <%templar010> sun go DOWN
[2:21:07] <kingjames7789> its like a water bed so yes
[2:21:08] <BoneofMalkav> Depends on how far along in their pregnancy they're in iirc
[2:21:08] <%Pappajimbo> first helecopter flight was 1901
[2:21:08] <KaiserMario> Yes, but they shouldn't over do it
[2:21:08] <%SirGO0SE> its like shaking a magic 8 ball with your baby brain
[2:21:08] <+tinypouf> just hold the belly and run
[2:21:08] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[2:21:09] <+other_badger> even racial slurs?
[2:21:10] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> When a preggnant woman runs, can she feel the baby bouncing in her stomach?
[2:21:12] <yourliteraldog> we still get call you a dumb ass though
[2:21:14] <SatoruMasamune> Depends on how far along they are.
[2:21:14] <Wyrmsblood> It's like shaking a martini
[2:21:14] <%Ner234> bork
[2:21:14] <+xKING_IRA> id assume so. if not sex would be nightmarish
[2:21:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> OhMyDog
[2:21:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> ...Maybe. I wouldnt recommend it. It's like a bowling ball wrapped in jello in there
[2:21:17] <+GingerStrawhat> But again it's the 30's so who really knows at this point?
[2:21:18] <+AXL808> a brisk walk maybe?
[2:21:18] <%king_wragles> No Pat, it'll agitate the baby and cause it to attack
[2:21:19] <%MidnightBurst12> the baby has the goo to cushion them
[2:21:19] <ToneBacas> shaken baby syndrome is a thing so don't do it
[2:21:19] <RickSaintRiot> Only reason we don't use airships now is because hydrogen is dangerous
[2:21:20] <+Pookiedaexzile> Imma Go out on a limb and say running is probably bad
[2:21:20] <%IminyourBase> HE SCREM FOR FUD
[2:21:20] <mr_slaide> Cause she's a wahmyn and simps will defend her.
[2:21:22] <penitentpendant> At most, your climbing speed might be effected
[2:21:22] <%Dingalow> It doesn't make the question less stupid, stupid
[2:21:23] <%shurtal> @PatStaresAt there was a woman like a week ago that ran a marathon at 9 months
[2:21:23] <dots4eyes> The mech has good cushioning for the pilot
[2:21:23] <+SimplyPandaz> Why baby so mad
[2:21:26] <+other_badger> OL CHAP
[2:21:26] <%AFlyingTaco1> But we can still call you stupid for asking it, Pat
[2:21:27] <dinnydanny777> Is it like running with a full stomach
[2:21:29] <arkv01> sex while pregnant is pretty nightmarish
[2:21:30] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp psaHoldon

[2:35:03] <kingjames7789> go fuck that hand
[2:35:04] <RickSaintRiot> he said "if @problemagic doesn't pay attention during Pat's stream, i will kill them"
[2:35:04] <%captain_thickthighs> @ arcielardor how about crharacter creation?
[2:35:05] <soraabora> balanced for lean
[2:35:05] <%Broand> because it's called amnesia getit

[2:35:10] <problemagic> hate when forget about gameplay
[2:35:10] <olm46> It's good that the pregnant lady can dance a jig in this dire time.
[2:35:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But Chat is here. Chat will kick baby for you

[2:35:47] <dinnydanny777> You can see through the gaps in the door
[2:35:50] <%AFlyingTaco1> @Dingalow It flows well and feels satisfying to land hits
[2:35:52] <yourliteraldog> The only good French person since Charles De Gaul was Jean Pierre Polnareff prove me wrong.
[2:35:53] <kingjames7789> cook baby in oven
[2:36:02] <%condemned_15> bang the pots and pans at the monstar
[2:36:05] <+Grandnatics> it's a food baby
[2:36:05] <RickSaintRiot> Fast-forwarded time to ONLY the morning sickness parts
[2:36:14] <kingjames7789> consume the baby for extrea health bonus
[2:36:20] <+Kurt_0> French woman dies in the middle of nowhere

[2:36:32] <%Laecerelius> A crossbow?
[2:36:36] <silverira> Time to cook some Balut
[2:36:39] <problemagic> @dingalow yes. you expand the the move list by leveling different classes but you get a fast paced combat system and giant monsters you have to climb on to defeat
[2:36:41] <RickSaintRiot> or is it just a bow nailed to a plank
[2:36:41] <%Cozy90> @It_sjustjoey Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra
[2:36:42] <+other_badger> space france doesn't count

[2:37:22] <+other_badger> Jebaited
[2:37:25] <RetroCop87> LE FUCK

[2:37:29] <%Profmcstevie> Damn lady you're more vocal than a Arcysystem Works game
[2:37:33] <%realm_forge> Put baby on crossbow. Launch baby for sick style points
[2:37:38] <problemagic> DD was one of the most overlooked PS3 games imo
[2:37:39] <kingjames7789> cheap jump sacres make good horror games right guys ?
[2:37:44] <%Pappajimbo> it looks like its made out of table so they could have ran out of bullets
[2:37:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Broand We never saw it coming
[2:37:46] <Cerabret100> So are the fear screen effects from DD still in? because those ended up giving me headaches
[2:37:51] <RickSaintRiot> I hope they add a Quiet Mode to this game.

[2:41:17] <problemagic> @dingalow You create your own character, down to details of physical build (which affects weight and therefore mobility) and you also create a "pawn" which is a literally cannon NPC Ally. you also use 2 other people's pawns to form a party of 4.
[2:41:23] <%Broand> looks like he met his match
[2:41:27] <%Jekado> you know its weird matches do not last forever i found out

[2:44:56] <%Jekado> you need to go back to the crossbow i think
[2:44:57] <ThirdPersonPhil> needs "motor"
[2:44:59] <%Jekado> or balista
[2:45:04] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt He used the elevator part for the ballista
[2:45:06] <%realm_forge> Pet doggo for + 5 courage
[2:45:06] <penitentpendant> Balista was on first floor

[2:49:39] <kingjames7789> and were only what two three hours in to the game ?
[2:49:47] <RickSaintRiot> i cast magic missile
[2:49:49] <+other_badger> watch your step [PLAYER NAME HERE]
[2:49:49] <%barkon345> so has this been as scary as the first one?
[2:49:51] <+TheNewZealandStory> like two hours from the start of the game to reaching anything resembling an obstacle
[2:49:54] <%condemned_15> cant be spooked if you're psaBlind
[2:49:56] <HotMafia81> Credit where it's due: the setting is a really cool choice, and it's rendered really nicely

[2:50:18] <%AFlyingTaco1> Wait did she say that to herself?
[2:50:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> I really would turn the hint system off.
[2:50:20] <kingjames7789> how many hours is pat in ?
[2:50:22] <%condemned_15> really?
[2:50:25] <%Dingalow> I must have missed that

[2:50:26] <@SoFarFetched> !uptime
[2:50:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 50m.
[2:50:27] <%Ner234> @TheNewZealandStory What type of horror games do you like?
[2:50:27] <+Daidis> didnt that happen in amnesia dark descent
[2:50:27] <+J_Papa> I thought that was lame too
[2:50:30] <%AFlyingTaco1> Nice
[2:50:31] <%Andrizzleton> that happens in the first amnesia
[2:50:34] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt It wasn't spoiled, you were just fucking with the elevator and it didn't trigger properly
[2:50:37] <penitentpendant> It's supposed to make you tense for the jumpscare, but it fell flat
[2:50:39] <Badgerconda_> how did you not know there was a monster?
[2:50:39] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Is as bad as Soma?
[2:50:45] <%condemned_15> Plays third Amnesia game. There's monsters?!
[2:50:45] <Badgerconda_> it's a horror game, of course there's monsters.
[2:50:46] <%Dementedpenguin> @Dingalow It happened as he was leaving the elevator
[2:50:49] <kingjames7789> hes two hours in ? and we just now seeing a monster
[2:50:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AnIcedCoffee Ah, so it was just jank.
[2:50:52] <%donkymagooterson> yeah there should be an option to turn off hints
[2:50:55] <RetroCop87> ghouls are the hottest monstergirls
[2:50:56] <DensityD> turn the lights off pat, get scared
[2:50:56] <+other_badger> le ghül
[2:50:59] <Koopardon> HEr mind has been ravaged by Al Ghul
[2:51:00] <yourliteraldog> Bitch you know it was a Desert Demon
[2:51:00] <%AFlyingTaco1> So is this a remake of the first game or just a different one entirely?
[2:51:01] <RickSaintRiot> incredible monster physics
[2:51:08] <+Dragon4234> Got that Machine for Pigs pacing eh
[2:51:09] <Chaos_kun> Amnesia PowerPoint
[2:51:14] <RickSaintRiot> it is a different game in the same universe
[2:51:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Hey pat, did you know they dropped the hint early in Dark Descent...as in 45 minutes before the first monster even spawns
[2:51:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> The first game warned you about hiding in closets, and then didn't actually spawn a monster
[2:51:20] <%Dingalow> @Dementedpenguin Ohhh that hint? I thought there was a loading screen or something
[2:51:20] <sakeydo> Ra Sal Ghul?
[2:51:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> predicting genocide in the plot here
[2:51:21] <kingjames7789> @RetroCop87 true no need for air no need to stop sucking
[2:51:29] <iswearimjustdandy> @aflyingtaco1 completely different but narratively connected
[2:51:31] <DensityD> RetroCop87 out here with a hill to die on
[2:51:32] <+TheNewZealandStory> @Ner234 Silent Hill 1-4, survival horror style Resident Evil, Haunting Ground, Clock Tower, Fatal Frame, Siren
[2:51:32] <+J_Papa> I don't like the character talking to herself
[2:51:35] <%Andrizzleton> no they do it right before you run into the monster in DD
[2:51:40] <%AnIcedCoffee> @CommanderSqueaks Yeah, the monster sound that played before is supposed to play at the same time as the hint
[2:51:41] <DensityD> DON'T. SHOW. THE. MONSTER.
[2:51:45] <olm46> Antici- pation
[2:51:45] <DensityD> it's the best tactic

[2:51:50] <yourliteraldog> If its super early you forget
[2:51:54] <DensityD> bitches love cannons
[2:51:55] <RickSaintRiot> SHOW THE MONSTER
[2:51:57] <%donkymagooterson> using hints to build tension instead of ruining the tension with hints
[2:51:58] <%Dementedpenguin> @Dingalow yeah, just that
[2:52:00] <kingjames7789> le cannon
[2:52:02] <%Dingalow> I mean to be fair, monsters are kind of a given in Amnesia but they shouldn't drop a hint right before the encounter
[2:52:06] <penitentpendant> There are no wheels
[2:52:06] <+FoolsArcade> NO WHEELS
[2:52:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> "I have a great idea"

[3:03:18] <%g0atmeal> Nice try monster, that's a loading door
[3:03:18] <+gardan00> that killed all the tension lol
[3:03:21] <+VoxelFox51> How far into the game is this?
[3:03:21] <Whatsamagiga> Reject Amnesia 3, Revert to Monky
[3:03:23] <%machshop> le fuck
[3:03:24] <%Dementedpenguin> I don't think "hint" is the right term to use here.......
[3:03:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Haha, the STRONGEST of barriers: Loading zones
[3:03:26] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[3:03:27] <Bigyanno> INB4 those plants are actually tentacles

[3:03:33] <slix3431> I want her to do that and then the baby hits the sand

[3:03:36] <+VoxelFox51> mmmm, monke
[3:03:38] <%AncelDeLambert> *Bendy
[3:03:38] <yourliteraldog> Aw Shit it's speaking baby is speaking R'leyan put it down.
[3:03:43] <RickSaintRiot> Penumbra: Monky
[3:03:47] <%shiplord13> In any other game I would say this big open area is a boss fight arena
[3:03:51] <ranarath> This is a really slow burn.
[3:03:52] <yourliteraldog> Slendy Man?
[3:03:52] <undercoverbarber> atpLaw atpWind
[3:03:52] <+krispen_wa> AW LAWD ITS COMING
[3:03:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> I sure to love Speaking in a foreign language when I'm stressed out and scared
[3:03:59] <Taconotz> I fucking love the baby mechanic for an incentive to not die
[3:04:01] <Parapattern> un singe terrible
[3:04:02] <Visorak6> Sounds like he actually did shoot it
[3:04:02] <%AncelDeLambert> WHY would you think that?
[3:04:07] <AnnotatedAnime> I can't believe the monke was behind all this
[3:04:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> IT just flows outa me
[3:04:09] <penitentpendant> Occasionally the 'Belly' button gives more monologue. I believe it flashes blue at the lower part of the screen.
[3:04:13] <+CannonHeroBrett> check baby
[3:04:16] <RickSaintRiot> I would be so happy if there was a day/night cycle outside
[3:04:18] <%AncelDeLambert> MERDE
[3:04:22] <problemagic> makes me want to stomp on my own dick
[3:04:23] <%luftraumm1> I figure the run from horror genre kind of peaked already, it's mostly tropey and uninteresting these days
[3:04:27] <%Monkeyweed21> oh no Woolie is doing GG lore
[3:04:29] <silentblast93> so is this in the 19teens?
[3:04:30] <RickSaintRiot> there's probably not. it's linked to progress i imagine
[3:04:35] <%jyeowa> i think the first amensia monster got his parade rained on by a loading screen door too funnily enough
[3:04:37] <%AFlyingTaco1> That better not have been the only encounter with that monster
[3:04:39] <silentblast93> is the like in ww1
[3:04:41] <%BinaryFireball> how conveniant
[3:04:46] <RickSaintRiot> @silentblast93 1937
[3:04:47] <slix3431> This game looks like shit
[3:04:47] <%BinaryFireball> that the tank is pointing at door
[3:04:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Monkeyweed21 Oh no.
[3:04:53] <kingjames7789> wait why ?
[3:04:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Monkeyweed21 RIP woolie
[3:05:02] <kool450> @slix3431 then dont watch
[3:05:05] <yourliteraldog> you think there would be more left over arms and ammunition in afrench fort
[3:05:09] <%AncelDeLambert> all of that to get BACK to this puzzle?
[3:05:17] <penitentpendant> I assume you'll have to lock in position after aiming to fire
[3:05:18] <silentblast93> so befor adolf doing the bad thing
[3:05:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yourliteraldog That'd be the first shit that'd get looted.
[3:05:23] <slix3431> Fire a tank with Baby in the shockwave
[3:05:25] <+ThemDubs> is game spooky so far?
[3:05:26] <+Wandering_Joe> Wandering_Joe subscribed with Prime. 
[3:05:28] <$Afterman_> now shoot de ghul
[3:05:31] <RickSaintRiot> I genuinely love the physics in these games. Hope there's more of it
[3:05:33] <yourliteraldog> aw yeah turret sequence like the mid 2000s
[3:05:39] <penitentpendant> Now to find a shell
[3:05:41] <%AncelDeLambert> load shell

[3:05:58] <$Afterman_> shoot da glass
[3:05:58] <%luftraumm1> not very spooky, interesting setting but stale gameplay
[3:06:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> Load the baguette
[3:06:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wow...that aoc chat goin by REAL damn quick.
[3:06:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I'd be so afraid of the rusty lip of that port cutting the shit out of me
[3:06:03] <%jyeowa> load the baby into the tank shell
[3:06:06] <%AFlyingTaco1> Shoot the corpse's dick

[3:06:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dementia

[3:06:57] <olm46> Pregnant ladies are notoriously disinterested in hydration.
[3:06:57] <SatoruMasamune> TIME PREGNANCY DONT NEED NO WATER
[3:06:59] <AnnotatedAnime> I think it's actually a pretty good game. Problem is imo it lives up to the original but games are more fast paced compared to 10 years ago
[3:06:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> She has...Memory Loss

[3:09:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> I'm 76.5% sure
[3:09:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> A cup of oil, a bottle of bread, and a loaf of milk
[3:09:34] <%luftraumm1> wasn't there a match over there on that bench?
[3:09:37] <Teras_ode> but can we be sure Peter has the salt? 🤔
[3:09:41] <%Monkeyweed21> tanning
[3:09:41] <s1rcuit> aside from the milk, that sounds like the recipe for gunpowder
[3:09:42] <Whatsamagiga> From all the streams I've watched so far, most have just called it at the 3 hour mark either at or just after this section

[3:11:03] <+mckraven> cause it's loud
[3:11:05] <+krispen_wa> lol it never would have hit her anyways
[3:11:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think it was counting on you tripping it and being a touch short
[3:11:05] <ThirdPersonPhil> it might not even hit you
[3:11:05] <%donkymagooterson> that was a pretty big shaft
[3:11:06] <%g0atmeal> Didn't look like it would have hit you
[3:11:08] <yourliteraldog> cus she a wimmin
[3:11:08] <SaltyAzteca> "Oh no, I got it right?!" FEAR

[3:11:46] <SatoruMasamune> GET THE AXE!
[3:11:46] <penitentpendant> This game has the problem of 'missing the scare'

[3:23:46] <LunarRemix> It's kind of a lame game
[3:23:46] <Fien111> I don't think Amnesia was EVER good, so I'm just bored
[3:23:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GabeSweetMan yeah
[3:23:47] <problemagic> autocorrect cest la vie to castlevania that is STRONG
[3:23:50] <%heartlesshealer> But better than Machine For Pigs? psaSmug
[3:23:52] <%Cozy90> yeah this game is boring
[3:23:55] <%donkymagooterson> it gets more soma-like as you progress - but it's still not quite there
[3:23:56] <penitentpendant> Too many flashbacks kill this games pacing
[3:23:57] <+HitchhikingThrough> Oh that's depressing
[3:24:01] <gamewarden92> It's a 2010 horror game.
[3:24:02] <yourliteraldog> LA CROIX
[3:24:04] <kingjames7789> is this the only horror game we getting this year ?
[3:24:08] <stabbityrabbit> Yeah, this is kinda boring.
[3:24:11] <animaspark> low hanging fruit
[3:24:11] <yourliteraldog> not a high bar
[3:24:17] <+lazysaiyajin> what was it about?
[3:24:18] <RickSaintRiot> no, there's FAITH
[3:24:18] <$hellfragger> @kingjames7789 Little Hope drops the 30th
[3:24:18] <olm46> Machine for pigs has a rad ending speech though.
[3:24:19] <$RealThiele> low bar
[3:24:20] <%realm_forge> This game sucks play cry of fear again
[3:24:22] <$8BitDsx> Machine for Pigs is the Invisible War of the Amnesia games.
[3:24:23] <RickSaintRiot> and lots of smaller indie games
[3:24:23] <yourliteraldog> Play doom instead
[3:24:24] <ArkanumZilong> a wet turd is better than machine for pigs
[3:24:26] <Dino_from_YoAssThiccPark> mai door
[3:24:27] <+ItalianWaifu> what made machine for pigs so awful?
[3:24:31] <%aishman> I still say SOMA was their best work but I know some people weren't into the subject matter.
[3:24:33] <+Undenizen> I was sad Machine For Pigs was bad. I wanted to like it SO MUCH
[3:24:33] <Oxybe> Hey Pat. Nergigante is a dirty slut. Just got into MonHunt and i'm being told to kill this big spikey jerk. hopefully you're having a nicer time in this spoop game then i am with killing jerks.
[3:24:39] <@commanderclaw> Pat is enjoying pretending to be a french stereotype more than he's enjoying the game
[3:24:39] <scottjefferson2punto0> Yes! time for amnesia!
[3:24:40] <$hellfragger> @ItalianWaifu Walking sim with no scares
[3:24:40] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt This game takes until the 3 hour mark to start picking up with the pacing and it kinda blows
[3:24:40] <gustavozxd> not as good as crying is not enough atpClaire
[3:24:41] <problemagic> trip over bar
[3:24:43] <kingjames7789> whats that smell
[3:24:44] <Fien111> Amnesia falls apart when you realize that you can count down to the fucking SECOND that the monster is active and know exactly how to get away from it after dying only ONCE
[3:24:44] <%GabeSweetMan> Their track record is 50/50 it seems. They either make a classic or crap. Which is not uncommon for horror franchises tbh.
[3:24:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what a helpful monster
[3:24:46] <kingjames7789> its blood
[3:24:47] <%bassoontyphoon> bassoontyphoon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! woo, three months. Thanks for all of the content you're putting out there. Boy did I wish this game was better, I would argue that Machine for Pigs at least has a better story so far
[3:24:47] <Parapattern> The amount of notes is reminding me of that episode in the Simpsons when they go to Flanders' beach house and it's covered in sticky notes
[3:24:48] <%Niney_Who> RUN BITCH

[3:30:21] <jorniev> COOL PUZZLE
[3:30:22] <%Niney_Who> IT fell
[3:30:23] <%heartlesshealer> fucking fell through the basements
[3:30:24] <Nordguy> @koopardon ????
[3:30:24] <%Profmcstevie> Did.....did we fall down a well
[3:30:24] <Bigyanno> Now this right here makes me really anxious
[3:30:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> There was a building underneath the ground.
[3:30:25] <+Undenizen> the tank fell through the floor
[3:30:26] <silentblast93> you fell 4 stories
[3:30:27] <DensityD> the entire tank fell down 3 stories
[3:30:27] <$hellfragger> WATER
[3:30:28] <soraabora> pat you dislodged the rocsk and then didnt try again
[3:30:28] <+HitchhikingThrough> HOW HAD IT NOT FALLEN ALREADY?
[3:30:28] <%jyeowa> one bolt ruins history
[3:30:29] <%AzureGale> Someone set you up the bomb
[3:30:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> The floor colapesed under the tank
[3:30:30] <%Anime_Flux> There was a hole here. It's HUGE now.
[3:30:30] <%Monkeyweed21> tank fell
[3:30:30] <%luftraumm1> you're turning the turret
[3:30:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @yourliteraldog Good to know.
[3:30:31] <%WhereIsWill> oh this looks REAL bad
[3:30:31] <$Wnds> you fell
[3:30:32] <%AFlyingTaco1> It fell down into the fort Pat
[3:30:32] <sausagesausage> you fell that far LUL
[3:30:33] <Bigyanno> being trapped is a genuine phobia of mine
[3:30:34] <%Niney_Who> You're Fat
[3:30:34] <kingjames7789> you got sent to brazil
[3:30:35] <%Grandnatics> @yourliteraldog like a 3 story drop?
[3:30:36] <%condemned_15> The Ground collapsed under the recoil of the tank
[3:30:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> clearly a building with weak sttructural integrity was below the tank
[3:30:37] <samcast1> this feel like some mook wanted to make their very own horror movie
[3:30:37] <+Undenizen> recoil
[3:30:37] <%Broand> recoil?
[3:30:37] <jorniev> YOU FELL
[3:30:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Because boolet
[3:30:39] <%arcielardor> you're the baby controlling the mother like a flesh-gundam
[3:30:39] <silentblast93> the recoil?
[3:30:39] <+Bulagne> How polite of the tank to land perfectly upright like that
[3:30:40] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt You missed a note talking about the ruin excavation underneath the fort, the whole place is falling apart
[3:30:41] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz you shot a big shell
[3:30:41] <SaltyAzteca> Weak earth? iunneven
[3:30:41] <%slimmixrp> The tank shot shattered the earth i guess
[3:30:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> Renault heavy i guess LUL
[3:30:42] <%heartlesshealer> because structure hollow and weak
[3:30:42] <soraabora> cause its heavy
[3:30:42] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt weak ceiling?
[3:30:42] <%CalderGaming> big boom make old rocks crumble
[3:30:42] <DensityD> tanks are heavy, did you know?
[3:30:44] <jorniev> CAUSE HOLES
[3:30:44] <Visorak6> recoil pat
[3:30:44] <$hellfragger> how is pat so stupid lol
[3:30:45] <RickSaintRiot> It's heavy and the floor was weak i guess
[3:30:45] <%snow_bush> Babies are stronger than the floor
[3:30:45] <%topendbuzza> because fuck you
[3:30:47] <sausagesausage> the orb
[3:30:47] <%za7az> Old?
[3:30:47] <Teras_ode> they parked the tank over boards or someshit LUL
[3:30:48] <penitentpendant> Blast caused vibratoins, which loosened floor
[3:30:48] <%RyTYoung> reasons
[3:30:49] <%AFlyingTaco1> The shock of the cannon firing probably
[3:30:49] <tolloponik> weight limit LUL
[3:30:49] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I think the logic is using the gun made the ground unstable and made it all fall?
[3:30:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Because you just fired a tank
[3:30:50] <%Niney_Who> Tanks have a lot of Recoil
[3:30:50] <%coreyyotto> the recoil created a shockwave that broke through the already decayed structure underneath it
[3:30:51] <gamezerox> plot
[3:30:51] <%patriotrenegade> the vibratons
[3:30:52] <yourliteraldog> yup that would do it
[3:30:52] <%donkymagooterson> the explosion caused the old-ass floor to collapse
[3:30:52] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> the floor collasped duh
[3:30:52] <%g0atmeal> just dig up
[3:30:53] <Koopardon> @Nordguy I heard a woman/child humming and I can't tell if it was in the game or in my head
[3:30:53] <Bigyanno> Because it's a tank
[3:30:54] <KaiserMario> Cause of bad vibrations
[3:30:55] <%luftraumm1> tank heavy, was supported by weak flooring
[3:30:55] <ssks123> the shell misfired?
[3:30:56] <%bassoontyphoon> @PatStaresAt an earlier note mentioned that the base was built on ruins
[3:30:57] <%realm_forge> You fell into the Woolie hole
[3:30:57] <+GuilKato> the force of teh shell launching.... magically made the floor weaken
[3:30:57] <DensityD> pat is sundowning?
[3:30:57] <%juxtest> The floor ate the tank
[3:30:58] <%crimsonharvest> because an explosion in the tank made everything shudder, then the building also exploded further shakink it
[3:30:59] <RickSaintRiot> I'm just irritated because the physics of the actual tank puzzle were so good
[3:31:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you shot a FUCKING TANK, do you think maybe that had something to do with it?
[3:31:01] <%Profmcstevie> Because the shockwaves of a tank shell in sandy shitholes break things?
[3:31:01] <xxshadowxx416> pregant women is so fat that
[3:31:01] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt There were floors below you and it couldn't take the repeated firing of the tank
[3:31:02] <Bigyanno> tank heavy, floor old
[3:31:02] <problemagic> later alligator "it looks like you're no good at this"
[3:31:03] <RetributionP> no this game is stupid lol
[3:31:04] <Lancaster_H> tanks are heavy af
[3:31:06] <%BonewheelVanguard> weak foundation big boom
[3:31:08] <%Pappajimbo> floor weak and you made big boom
[3:31:11] <soraabora> do not tell me this game has a water part
[3:31:12] <kingjames7789> guys this game is making me sleepy
[3:31:14] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat doesnt use logic much does he?
[3:31:15] <gustavozxd> because she said "what could go wrong" Pat
[3:31:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I guess the baby really TANKED the damage
[3:31:18] <%Niney_Who> SEWER LEVEL
[3:31:23] <%AFlyingTaco1> Oh yes
[3:31:24] <$hellfragger> WATER TIME
[3:31:24] <%GabeSweetMan> What is the military's obsession with building stuff on CURSED shit?
[3:31:25] <RickSaintRiot> oooh i hope this game has a water part
[3:31:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck Naw he plays completely on emotion.
[3:31:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you shot a tank bullet, Pat. Those tend to have quite the bit of force behind em.
[3:31:27] <%jyeowa> into the catacombs

[3:32:45] <%Niney_Who> This lantern burns fuel so fast
[3:32:51] <%donkymagooterson> I wonder how well-acquainted Pat is with The Dark Descent...
[3:32:52] <+ItalianWaifu> the baby latter died of a cold

[3:33:04] <%g0atmeal> Hey, listen!
[3:33:05] <kingjames7789> oh what is this nonsense
[3:33:07] <Parapattern> This game would be a lot better if you had a little baby puppy with you instead of a boring human pregnancy
[3:33:07] <Guardiansaiyan> huh
[3:33:09] <penitentpendant> Eldritch Fertility Goddess checking up on her Surrogate
[3:33:09] <+HitchhikingThrough> Yup, that's a magic!
[3:33:10] <%jyeowa> looks like we're about to have a dark descent
[3:33:11] <problemagic> I had a baby in May this is pretty accurate for American healthcare
[3:33:12] <%captain_thickthighs> thats a nope
[3:33:13] <%WhereIsWill> dafuq is this? MIDIAN?!
[3:33:14] <%patriotrenegade> Piss off ghost
[3:33:15] <animaspark> and now we do a zelda
[3:33:15] <RetributionP> I would rather replay deathstranding for baby gameplay
[3:33:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Quigsies bruh. BRUH.

[3:33:17] <%Piemen99> wow that's hella deep

[3:33:32] <RickSaintRiot> this sort of thing was also in Descent.
[3:33:35] <%Jekado> they might connect
[3:33:38] <%luftraumm1> the scenery is very cool
[3:33:42] <kingjames7789> oh time for parkour again
[3:33:45] <+mccf> these sounds whole shit
[3:33:46] <%AFlyingTaco1> It's moving those platforms out from the wall
[3:33:47] <$Wnds> does this lead to blighttown?
[3:33:49] <problemagic> will you take the [CRANK]?
[3:33:50] <%arancet> reminds me of the prison in dark knight rises
[3:33:52] <%Jekado> you haven't used that thing in a while huh
[3:33:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> when we gonna get a water monster?
[3:33:59] <%realm_forge> @quigsies what if we’re all just in a giant stream chat before we’re born, and real life is the streamers?

[3:34:24] <+Urgotfantasy> kinda thick
[3:34:24] <animaspark> i saw a butt climbing a wall yeah
[3:34:26] <samcast1> lets just switch to Doom
[3:34:26] <Kronark> It flashed you. I'm horrified.
[3:34:27] <+HitchhikingThrough> Ayy girl check me out!
[3:34:28] <Visorak6> It was creepy as fuck though
[3:34:29] <@commanderclaw> Man ass is the most threatening thing in the world
[3:34:30] <RickSaintRiot> idk, i think it's scary
[3:34:30] <+FNTR> he got the fatty
[3:34:30] <Grandma_Amari> These things remind me of the wendigos from Until Dawn a bit
[3:34:30] <soraabora> I dont know i'm pretty scared
[3:34:33] <soraabora> but im. ababy
[3:34:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I saw a butt. That's all I saw.
[3:34:34] <%AzureGale> It would be scarier if it were pooping
[3:34:35] <%AFlyingTaco1> I didn't eve see it
[3:34:36] <RickSaintRiot> what if he poops on you
[3:34:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It's scary to me, but not in the way they wanted, probably
[3:34:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> spooky ass
[3:34:42] <sausagesausage> monkaS
[3:34:42] <$Wnds> pfft light, who needs it
[3:34:43] <kingjames7789> what that monster mouth do tho ?
[3:34:44] <HotMafia81> Shiite
[3:34:44] <SaltyAzteca> "why not take the torch" Kappa
[3:34:45] <penitentpendant> Hopefully you don't need to cook anything
[3:34:46] <%shurtal> I dunno, buttholes are pretty scary
[3:34:46] <%captain_thickthighs> it looked like prnkin duck
[3:34:49] <yourliteraldog> it looked like a dude
[3:34:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> WELCOME TO DARK AMNESIA
[3:34:52] <+ItalianWaifu> the monster is just some meth head grab a stick or pipe and beat him
[3:34:52] <%JumboCrunchies> Pat I think you can pick up the torch
[3:34:54] <RickSaintRiot> that's the scariest part about a sewer level, all the poop
[3:34:54] <%Valdorick> A Spoopy pooper
[3:34:55] <problemagic> what if you see it on the way out?
[3:34:57] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Are those torches nailed to the walls? Why doesnt she just take one of them?
[3:35:00] <+mccf> darkness imprisoning me
[3:35:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> I can't believe Pat is so bad at resource management. Kappa
[3:35:01] <%JumboCrunchies> It was glowing
[3:35:01] <KaiserMario> You were saying?
[3:35:05] <%CzeekyPlays> Pat running out of light in a bright area bodes well for the future
[3:35:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> torch beside you
[3:35:17] <silverira> The Clap of his buttcheeks keeps me losing sanity
[3:35:21] <kingjames7789> @ItalianWaifu meth turns you into a goo monster ?
[3:35:24] <penitentpendant> This doesn't feel like a horror game, this feels like fodder for MST3King horror games
[3:35:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> I kinda hate the "monster is really a almost human thing" its rarely done right
[3:35:32] <godzookylives> moops
[3:35:32] <TheHeroAppears> this game really does showcase that the scariest thing in life is in fact being pregnant
[3:35:34] <kingjames7789> pop a dime off his ass
[3:35:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Keep in mind: Moorish is middle-eastern, originally Ottomans, as the note said
[3:35:55] <yourliteraldog> spice must flow
[3:35:59] <animaspark> i like how old persian ruins are litered with modern light making resources ready for use all the time
[3:36:00] <DensityD> WOW THAT'S A SOUND
[3:36:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> huh...yeah thsi feels like something to riff on for fun.
[3:36:02] <Wyrmsblood> I'm a dude and I'm a terrified of being pregnant
[3:36:04] <problemagic> look at mr "i can read" lording it over the rest of us
[3:36:04] <%Niney_Who> Oh look the Lore Cylinders
[3:36:04] <RickSaintRiot> no, the Moors are North Africans
[3:36:04] <%Grandnatics> Another one?
[3:36:06] <%bassoontyphoon> omikron?
[3:36:09] <gamewarden92> Oh, one of THOSE things.
[3:36:16] <arkv01> uh, whoa
[3:36:20] <%luftraumm1> this goo sound of the darkness is very stupid
[3:36:22] <penitentpendant> Another name!
[3:36:25] <yourliteraldog> gramaphone cylinder?
[3:36:25] <problemagic> BUFFERING
[3:36:25] <%donkymagooterson> honestly this game seems more like the devs wanting to explain the dark descent lore than making another pure horror game
[3:36:26] <Guardiansaiyan> tisa = tihana
[3:36:28] <RickSaintRiot> Ottomans were turks, central asian origin.
[3:36:29] <%Pappajimbo> kings evil is Tuberculous lymphadenitis

[3:36:40] <DensityD> Hakuna Matata
[3:36:41] <+HitchhikingThrough> It feels like it should be an audio log

[3:36:45] <RickSaintRiot> This sounds like Daniel
[3:36:45] <sausagesausage> sbfpPatschwitz

[3:37:09] <Guardiansaiyan> SPOILER ALERT: Thanos lives here
[3:37:09] <RetributionP> dragon balls?
[3:37:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> You have latern oil.
[3:37:17] <+Undenizen> Pat, I don't know if you've noticed but there appear to be black worms on your eyeballs. You should sort that out.
[3:37:18] <%Broand> that was a very misinterpreted version of the goetia

[3:37:25] <POUNDCAYK> soooooo goooooooey
[3:37:27] <%Broand> "Dukes, got it"
[3:37:30] <Wyrmsblood> Is this the Lord of the Rings font?
[3:37:31] <%AzureGale> I thought darkness was your oldest friend
[3:37:35] <yourliteraldog> the black evil
[3:37:39] <+GundamF91> This is like being in Deepnest
[3:37:40] <%Anime_Flux> LUL

[3:37:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AzureGale he owes us like 60 bucks
[3:37:55] <RickSaintRiot> It does rather look like the dwarven runes
[3:37:55] <%JumboCrunchies> Its coming out both my speakers at a weird level that nothing else is.
[3:37:55] <+GrateMan> Can barely see anything
[3:37:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ooooh boy

[3:38:51] <Bigyanno> Is this the first time we've seen a monster?
[3:38:52] <%Puhff> Yeah this game too spoopy, immma watch AOC play Among Us lol
[3:38:52] <+Nefarious_Niblet> uhnGiga
[3:38:52] <%Grandnatics> I can't tell if this is a fail or a success
[3:38:52] <yourliteraldog> punishment jump scares
[3:38:53] <%topendbuzza> yawn
[3:38:53] <undercoverbarber> atpCornteen atpCornteen atpCornteen
[3:38:53] <+chattychocobo> thats a pretty lame death
[3:38:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> was this a forced encounter?
[3:38:54] <problemagic> for the love of shit fuckin God
[3:38:55] <%machshop> make us whole isaac
[3:38:55] <%Anime_Flux> Are we supposed to be scared yet?
[3:38:56] <%condemned_15> sounds like someone stirring some mac and cheese
[3:38:57] <%Broand> This is a little drawn out
[3:39:00] <+CannonHeroBrett> @Jack8274 no
[3:39:00] <stabbityrabbit> Is this scripted?
[3:39:00] <%GabeSweetMan> Flesh monsters from original are way better.
[3:39:02] <%realm_forge> Wow somebody ripped off Until Dawn
[3:39:02] <%Grandnatics> No game overs
[3:39:02] <%AFlyingTaco1> Don't play this part, only watch
[3:39:04] <%bassoontyphoon> I will fight any of you, but I am feeling that machine for pigs is better than this
[3:39:06] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Not really scary when the player runs towards the creature
[3:39:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> was that suppose to happen?
[3:39:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> This felt like a forced sanity drop thing
[3:39:07] <Guardiansaiyan> That zombies face looks like the Windigos in Until Dawn @PatStaresAt
[3:39:09] <problemagic> *is surprised at getting fucked*
[3:39:09] <%Anime_Flux> AKIRA
[3:39:09] <%nimu290> i am lost
[3:39:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Zaphire_Saucypants No, I think the sanity meter going down spawned it.
[3:39:10] <%topendbuzza> HOT
[3:39:11] <dredayah> who was actually scared
[3:39:11] <%GabeSweetMan> Is this NOT a game over???
[3:39:12] <sausagesausage> scripted?
[3:39:12] <%machshop> the dahkness
[3:39:13] <%Ynkubus_> that monster looked super lame
[3:39:13] <%slimmixrp> Was that scripted?
[3:39:14] <%AzureGale> Oh no, my clothes are gone!!!!!
[3:39:14] <hot_take_jake> like after horrible shit in Soma, they went with this?
[3:39:15] <Frostydough1> ASMR Kreygasm
[3:39:15] <LoneFonte> So, this is not scary, but i am interested
[3:39:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> we the dark souls now
[3:39:16] <jorniev> SILENT HILL 3 MUCH
[3:39:17] <$Wnds> wut
[3:39:18] <%Profmcstevie> So turns out, this game does not send you back to loads. It actually skips past the monster
[3:39:18] <+trashcansan> ????????
[3:39:19] <HotMafia81> Amnesia 2: Among Thieves
[3:39:21] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Btw there's no failure states
[3:39:21] <Jack8274> What is this then? Prequal?
[3:39:23] <kingjames7789> shes gaining eyes on the inside
[3:39:23] <DensityD> literally no punishment?
[3:39:25] <%captain_thickthighs> is the game supposed to get the player amnesia too cuz I can't seem to remember what's going on
[3:39:25] <%Cozy90> psaDown
[3:39:26] <+Kurt_0> So on a scale of one to ten how much are you enjoying this
[3:39:27] <Wyrmsblood> Spooky
[3:39:28] <%crimsonharvest> is this the black evil i've heard so much about
[3:39:29] <Coconosuga> !uptime
[3:39:29] <RickSaintRiot> Either that's not the main monster/you're not supposed to die there, or they NERFED the death
[3:39:30] <animaspark> it would be AWESOME if this was not a forced encounter
[3:39:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 39m.
[3:39:30] <jorniev> THAT WAS VERY SILENT HILL 3
[3:39:31] <+J_Papa> when the darkness reaches Senua's head, the game is over
[3:39:34] <+J0hnnytightlips> AAAAAAAA IM GOING INSANE AAAAAAAAAA
[3:39:36] <problemagic> yharghul
[3:39:43] <yourliteraldog> bad gifa
[3:39:43] <%g0atmeal> I really want this game to be good, but I'm not feeling it so far
[3:39:45] <%shiplord13> How pregnant are you now
[3:39:45] <RickSaintRiot> I think it was the area you were in before
[3:39:45] <sausagesausage> fucking ALIENS
[3:39:46] <@StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[3:39:51] <penitentpendant> But +2 matches!
[3:39:54] <%Profmcstevie> There is no death, we just skip past the spoopy if the spoopy gets us
[3:39:55] <Teras_ode> bites za dusto?
[3:39:56] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I felt like she walked back herself...
[3:39:57] <%jyeowa> remember everyone, game overs are a failure of the ________ ?
[3:39:59] <+lazysaiyajin> is death just a reset
[3:40:02] <Guardiansaiyan> @shiplord13 4 months
[3:40:07] <+mccf> does this follow the teachings of lord cage of "game overs are a failing of the game designer?"
[3:40:10] <problemagic> carefully
[3:40:11] <%luftraumm1> looking for spookiness is going to be frustrating, better to think of this game as more of a mystery investigating game
[3:40:12] <Grandma_Amari> Hmm. It looks like instead of killing you it pulls you back a bit? So sort of like a checkpoint? Weird.
[3:40:13] <Guardiansaiyan> @jyeowa birth control pills
[3:40:13] <%templar010> checkpoint I guess
[3:40:14] <%donkymagooterson> good question
[3:40:14] <Jalexster> That's actually kind of an interesting way to handle dying
[3:40:15] <%bassoontyphoon> she has amnesia about how she got back here
[3:40:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh
[3:40:19] <%Laecerelius> Fucking deep one magic, they don't gotta explain it
[3:40:19] <%Pappajimbo> does pat not have a big oil
[3:40:21] <Jalexster> You don't die, you just go fucking insane
[3:40:22] <yourliteraldog> I thought you get a stabin at least
[3:40:25] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This really is a Cage game
[3:40:25] <DensityD> the monster appeared because you were going insane
[3:40:25] <penitentpendant> So far, the monsters have been 0 threat
[3:40:27] <%Grandnatics> Oh it's a glowworm
[3:40:32] <%Puhff> Also, why did it not kill her?
[3:40:35] <RickSaintRiot> No, no, that CAN'T be how it happened.
[3:40:36] <animaspark> the power of fetus compels you to backtrack?
[3:40:36] <+trashcansan> so they just appear when you're crazy?
[3:40:36] <Wyrmsblood> Game overs are a failure of the game design
[3:40:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mccf Well, I mean this is the equivalent of restarting at a checkpoint, just without the in-game death.
[3:40:41] <Parapattern> Oh, I thought there might actually be some tension for a second
[3:40:42] <%realm_forge> Why are the Until Dawn monsters in the amnesia game
[3:40:42] <sausagesausage> PogChamp PogChamp
[3:40:44] <LunarRemix> Uh I think game isn't very good
[3:40:48] <%Anime_Flux> Nancy Drew in The Mysterious Pregger Puzzle
[3:40:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> not a fan
[3:40:55] <sausagesausage> MLG match use
[3:40:55] <Jalexster> I mean, in the original game all that happens when you die is you return to the last checkpoint and the monster despawns
[3:40:56] <problemagic> ft: shadow the hedgehog
[3:40:59] <Jalexster> So it's really no different
[3:41:00] <SaltyAzteca> Just take the torch ya silly woman
[3:41:03] <Guardiansaiyan> @realm_forge I know right?! That monster face looked like the wendigos
[3:41:03] <%donkymagooterson> believe it or not this turns out to be a little better than a cage game
[3:41:06] <%Laecerelius> They don't kill you because they don't want to kill their evil overlord gestating inside of you! MWAHAHAHAHAHA!
[3:41:08] <DensityD> it makes you kill yourself?
[3:41:10] <RickSaintRiot> More than one mythology has a cannibal monster, man
[3:41:10] <%bassoontyphoon> Soma did something similar with its "deaths"
[3:41:14] <+HitchhikingThrough> If that's what it looks like when the monster gets you I'm not impressed
[3:41:14] <%Puhff> Puzzle time!
[3:41:18] <kingjames7789> puzzle time
[3:41:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> Lot less threatening when you're just gonna run through walls to safety if you ever get got :/
[3:41:20] <%condemned_15> psaBlind completly missed the blue ghost
[3:41:23] <kingjames7789> ayyy
[3:41:27] <+J_Papa> it looked exactly like an Until Dawn wendigo
[3:41:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Laecerelius You joke, but that might actually be it. Or the monster is Salim.
[3:41:31] <penitentpendant> That's bad precedent for a horror game, the monsters have been shown multiple times,but they've either been jumpscares or enforced encounters that ended with 0 harm
[3:41:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wendigos were more scary than that @Guardiansaiyan
[3:41:32] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh is this like an ancient crypt or some shit?
[3:41:37] <Wyrmsblood> I think Soma is a better game than this
[3:41:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm banking on the Monster being Salism
[3:41:41] <+HitchhikingThrough> Like I'm a wus when it comes to horror games, and that didn't even make me jump
[3:41:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> **Salim
[3:41:45] <Guardiansaiyan> @Zaphire_Saucypants true
[3:41:46] <RickSaintRiot> Monster can't be Salim, we saw Salim's body
[3:41:50] <yourliteraldog> It's Djinn or Desert Demon as I like to call them
[3:41:52] <penitentpendant> There's currently no threat to the main character besides gravity
[3:41:53] <DensityD> how does this even work
[3:41:59] <Kestrelos> If there's no fail state what is the difference between this and a VN?
[3:42:01] <lotusdagoat> is pat scared?
[3:42:07] <Jalexster> I mean, how would you prefer that death in these games be handled? Just "YOU DIED" and load the last checkpoint?
[3:42:08] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Remember in Dark Decent where if a monster got you, you'd die?
[3:42:10] <Guardiansaiyan> @penitentpendant gravity can have a grudge
[3:42:13] <DensityD> not nearly enough ropes and pulleys for this to actually be connected and function
[3:42:16] <DensityD> video game bullshit
[3:42:16] <+mccf> so game end may change if you die too many times?
[3:42:17] <kingjames7789> @Wyrmsblood yeah right ! did the devs that made soma quit or something
[3:42:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Kestrelos .... A lot of virtual novels totally have fail states? What?
[3:42:26] <+DeltascapeV4> Just joined. Is this game/dlc or whatever it is good?
[3:42:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> ***Visual novels
[3:42:28] <+trashcansan> what is this puzzle
[3:42:33] <penitentpendant> @Guardiansaiyan It IS the most powerful boss in all of videogame history
[3:42:38] <yourliteraldog> fuck off orb I See you being smug and shit\
[3:42:44] <Kestrelos> @CommanderSqueaks that makes this even worse then
[3:42:46] <+HitchhikingThrough> @DeltascapeV4 current consensus is mediocre
[3:42:48] <DensityD> Pat is frightened. by how bad this game is. bazorple
[3:42:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DeltascapeV4 It's a sequel game, and... not really?
[3:42:53] <%Grandnatics> @DeltascapeV4 Ehhh
[3:43:00] <%IminyourBase> being pregnant gives you a -1 to puzzles
[3:43:01] <RickSaintRiot> @DeltascapeV4 still finding out. Current status: not looking good.
[3:43:02] <Jalexster> If you've got unlimited lives then dying in horror games is irrelevant anyway, so how is this any worse?
[3:43:06] <sausagesausage> LUL
[3:43:06] <+DeltascapeV4> Aww that sucks
[3:43:06] <problemagic> THE MACHINE FOR PIGS IS CAPITALISM
[3:43:09] <%slimmixrp> Other side
[3:43:09] <+Dragon4234> @trashcansan operate the three wheels in a proper order?
[3:43:16] <DensityD> hang in there skeleton
[3:43:19] <tattleworm> it's about as good as the rest of the amnesia games
[3:43:20] <animaspark> whats the objective?
[3:43:24] <scottjefferson2punto0> its just a platform
[3:43:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> I feel like this game COULD be scary, but it's just missing a certain something.
[3:43:28] <gamewarden92> Baby Codex
[3:43:29] <+Dragon4234> NO ONE CAN SEE ME MOVE
[3:43:31] <Wyrmsblood> The scariest thing about this game so far is the pregnancy.
[3:43:32] <problemagic> eat other
[3:43:34] <+Dragon4234> IN THE DARKNESS
[3:43:39] <RickSaintRiot> you make me lose my SELF CON TROL
[3:43:40] <scottjefferson2punto0> so you can get to the other one
[3:43:41] <Guardiansaiyan> @CommanderSqueaks like art direction
[3:43:41] <sausagesausage> EPIC LOOTS
[3:43:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @DeltascapeV4 Had an interesting start up for me, then it got into weird territory that...was just weird, then meh scary man.
[3:43:49] <DensityD> god I hope this is just realm of old iron king
[3:43:49] <%IminyourBase> wait... if the darkness makes you crazy then shouldn't the baby be crazy?
[3:43:52] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt Do you care about knowing an easter egg in the new Doom DLC?
[3:43:54] <RetributionP> what if.. we played somthing from the metro series instead ?
[3:43:57] <+HitchhikingThrough> I think I maybe get it?
[3:43:57] <DensityD> I want to "don't give up, skeleton"
[3:43:59] <Wyrmsblood> PAT DO PUZZLE BETTER
[3:44:02] <problemagic> pregnancy is relationship hard mode
[3:44:10] <RickSaintRiot> Metro is also good
[3:44:11] <+lazysaiyajin> TÉNÈBRES
[3:44:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> be a smart lad, Pat.
[3:44:15] <Guardiansaiyan> @IminyourBase baby is always in darkness for 9 months...already crazy
[3:44:21] <Guardiansaiyan> SHADOW PUZZLES
[3:44:27] <+Dragon4234> Puzzle God
[3:44:34] <DensityD> door stuck door stuck
[3:44:38] <DensityD> please, I beg you
[3:44:39] <Jalexster> I think you just jump across?
[3:44:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> platforming puzzles, woooo
[3:44:41] <%za7az> I feel like the issue with this game is pacing
[3:44:45] <DensityD> BONE
[3:44:47] <kingjames7789> bone
[3:44:47] <sausagesausage> LUL
[3:44:51] <yourliteraldog> boner
[3:44:53] <%cylish> Im sorry but if you present me with the idea of Ryleh at the start of the game I am not excited for lever puzzels
[3:44:54] <+Dragon4234> WOW AMAZING
[3:44:54] <penitentpendant> So it looks like you want the hanging platform out far enough and high enough so you can jump to the next doorway?
[3:44:55] <animaspark> THAT a stron ass femur
[3:44:56] <Wyrmsblood> I can't believe this lady got deep dicked by Cthulhu
[3:44:59] <%IminyourBase> Yep that one bone
[3:44:59] <%Grandnatics> @PatStaresAt are you supposed to make a platform to jump onto, the 2nd door opened?
[3:44:59] <scottjefferson2punto0> BONE
[3:45:00] <RickSaintRiot> can't believe they put BONE PHYSICS in this game, 10/10
[3:45:00] <Jalexster> I think the idea is that you use the hanging thing to jump the gap?
[3:45:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ew, Paige's boner
[3:45:02] <yourliteraldog> for some reason
[3:45:06] <DensityD> 2 bones
[3:45:11] <LoneFonte> other bone?
[3:45:12] <gamewarden92> More bones?
[3:45:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> How could this be?
[3:45:15] <RickSaintRiot> game is good, bone physics
[3:45:15] <%Profmcstevie> Paige got her GIANT SKELETON in my puzzle
[3:45:19] <kingjames7789> can we get three bones ?
[3:45:25] <%IminyourBase> paige can't wait for pat to turn into bones
[3:45:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> dem bones dem bones
[3:45:43] <sausagesausage> cross the gap with the big bathtub drain?
[3:45:44] <penitentpendant> Oh, the divots near the ceiling
[3:45:46] <Jalexster> Pat
[3:45:48] <%Jekado> jump to the other one
[3:45:49] <Jalexster> Pat for gods sake
[3:45:50] <DensityD> no no, in living men, paige loves the shortness and the orb
[3:45:50] <%BonewheelVanguard> Yes, let us remove the human femur so we can enter the death door
[3:45:52] <penitentpendant> Dictate the path of the bucket
[3:46:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> he did it!
[3:46:00] <sausagesausage> PogChamp
[3:46:03] <kingjames7789> You did it !
[3:46:03] <+mccf> do puzzle good so
[3:46:05] <+HitchhikingThrough> I mean
[3:46:06] <DensityD> if the man is dead, PeachSaliva loves the bones
[3:46:11] <penitentpendant> Puzzle Defeated
[3:46:11] <%Anime_Flux> tunnel snakes rule
[3:46:15] <yourliteraldog> so did we skip a sequence because a fail state ?
[3:46:22] <%Grandnatics> Are you afraid of big, slappable monster asses?
[3:46:28] <sausagesausage> kinky
[3:46:28] <Guardiansaiyan> The monster is the DARKSIDE of CHAT Pat...they are listening!
[3:46:32] <yourliteraldog> You rember that scene in alien
[3:46:34] <DensityD> the monster's taint

[3:47:00] <%Niney_Who> Why would you go in this
[3:47:01] <@SoFarFetched> Sounds like pat isn't gonna play this again LUL
[3:47:01] <LoneFonte> @yourliteraldog nope, the game put us a little back and moved the monster

[3:51:08] <nilla_24> nice place
[3:51:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @trashcansan She's also survived for hours in the desert without water and had her broken ribs miracolously heal, so who the fuck knows at this point.
[3:51:15] <%bassoontyphoon> you have more oil
[3:51:16] <RickSaintRiot> They're really hammering away at the immersiveness, which has always been Descent's strong point. Bothersome.
[3:51:18] <sausagesausage> god i wish that were me
[3:51:19] <%Grandnatics> USE YOUR OIL
[3:51:20] <Sain_127> the game is ok back
[3:51:22] <DensityD> you love the goo
[3:51:23] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no, the goo
[3:51:25] <gamewarden92> Why doesn't this game want us to SEE!?
[3:51:26] <%jyeowa> it's still MASSIVELY unclear what this goop is and what happened to all these bodies
[3:51:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you have OIl

[3:51:46] <sausagesausage> Paiges closet
[3:51:47] <RickSaintRiot> She went to the Time Dimension immediately after being dried up, though. assuming that has something to do with it.
[3:51:48] <+trashcansan> that was actually an amnesia 1 reference lol
[3:51:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmm I could always use another skull cabinet
[3:51:51] <nilla_24> well hello
[3:51:51] <%Sasha_conyst> So how is this one compared to the first one. And is it better than Machine for Pigs?
[3:51:53] <%condemned_15> I alphabetized those skulls
[3:51:55] <Sain_127> shiver me bones
[3:51:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you are like an oil baron right now.

[3:52:08] <+mccf> I think the protagonist bickering with that AI chick in Soma were more entertaining than woman talking with baby

[3:53:17] <+Dragon4234> I mean yeah all their monster do
[3:53:18] <%Grandnatics> This monster SUCKS
[3:53:18] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt Pat, he tagged you, now you have to tag him back, that's how you play tag
[3:53:18] <ranarath> "Get the fuck out of my bone cave, stupid woman!"
[3:53:19] <+ItalianWaifu> ah the monster is playing Baldurs gate 3 too
[3:53:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> That monster is Salim, the fact that it purposely hasn't tried to kill you is proving it for me.
[3:53:25] <SatoruMasamune> LE EXCITEENG MUZAK, NON?
[3:53:27] <RickSaintRiot> Yeah it's normal for Amnesia.
[3:53:27] <+redthebaron> that was WILD
[3:53:28] <kingjames7789> 10/10 best part of the game so far
[3:53:30] <+HitchhikingThrough> "NEXT TIME I WON'T MISS"
[3:53:34] <+trashcansan> this is the weirdest game
[3:53:34] <+J0hnnytightlips> It pushed a preggo
[3:53:34] <Grandma_Amari> To be fair, the monster(s) in the first game just hit you too, but they were also SUPER threatening
[3:53:36] <penitentpendant> Crawl in water hole?
[3:53:40] <Bigyanno> That monster looks like a french meth addict
[3:53:41] <%jyeowa> @CommanderSqueaks why would it hunt you at all if it was salim?
[3:53:42] <LoneFonte> now I kinda wonder if that last encounter was actually scripted
[3:53:43] <%walternatorz> "oh look out, I'm gonna push you"
[3:53:45] <DensityD> I want that clip of Francine from American Dad shouting "I'M IN THE GOOOOOO!"
[3:53:47] <Visorak6> into the woolie hole
[3:53:49] <+GuilKato> if only this compound full of men with guns hadnt surrendered to the ghouls, they could have used GUNS to get rid of it

[3:56:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so it IS true. Babies are merely parasites that take over women's brains.
[3:56:17] <kingjames7789> to the games credit the water looks amazing
[3:56:17] <silverira> eat the baby to gain EYES ON THE INSIDE
[3:56:20] <%AncelDeLambert> THE BABY
[3:56:20] <%walternatorz> the baby
[3:56:22] <sausagesausage> wtf
[3:56:25] <%Spydurman> wishing you'd played Doom instead?
[3:56:25] <+Warden_Wolfie> How bad have we got so far
[3:56:26] <+HitchhikingThrough> G-G_G_G_G_GHOOOST
[3:56:31] <%jyeowa> oh look it's progress
[3:56:31] <yourliteraldog> fucking gohst
[3:56:33] <+Warden_Wolfie> I've heard its pretty bad
[3:56:33] <+redthebaron> the game is pretty at least
[3:56:36] <Parapattern> Salim's spirit
[3:56:37] <Guardiansaiyan> @SoFarFetched have the highlight message points thing always been 20k ?
[3:56:39] <+mostbrokenrobo> I mean, we are
[3:56:42] <+dante_must_die_exe> this video game is all drama, no horr orr
[3:56:42] <penitentpendant> Pat's state: Boredom
[3:56:43] <%Laecerelius> Is the ghost like her from the future or past or whatever?
[3:56:43] <Sain_127> "you heard about this game called RAID?"
[3:56:43] <%AzureGale> YAAAAAAY
[3:56:43] <+HitchhikingThrough> LUL
[3:56:44] <DensityD> the emotional state of the orb
[3:56:45] <mattatatatatatatat> pat u look so scared
[3:56:46] <+mostbrokenrobo> it's just not the emotions you expected
[3:56:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> OH I'm getting your emotional state right now
[3:56:47] <+lazysaiyajin> WHAT
[3:56:48] <yourliteraldog> You seem dead inside
[3:56:48] <+redthebaron> that was a really funny sound
[3:56:49] <kingjames7789> wtf was that noise
[3:56:49] <DensityD> no feels
[3:56:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> this game stinks
[3:56:52] <%Broand> was that a splatoon sound effect?
[3:56:53] <+LunarDensetsu> PHASMOPHOBIA
[3:56:53] <Thirtine> wha.....
[3:56:55] <%Niney_Who> What is that cake
[3:56:56] <+ThemDubs> turn down lights
[3:56:56] <+J_Papa> you seem mostly bored
[3:56:57] <+mccf> what
[3:56:57] <@SoFarFetched> @Guardiansaiyan They had to be turned to 20k because chat was being assholes and spamming highlighted messages nonstop.
[3:56:57] <soraabora> ohhh i'm having emotions its fine
[3:56:58] <+raddkern> this doesn't seem very tense at all
[3:56:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and that emotion is boredom
[3:56:58] <%luftraumm1> most of the emotions are tedium?
[3:56:58] <olm46> The scariest thing of all
[3:56:58] <+ssjklyco> Babies are scary
[3:57:00] <+LunarDensetsu> BIG FEELS
[3:57:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> What the fuck happed to that Monke's eye!?
[3:57:00] <LoneFonte> Big Boredom is an emotion
[3:57:01] <POUNDCAYK> pat more scared of chat LUL
[3:57:02] <Kronark> BUT PAT THE BABY
[3:57:04] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Maybe there is a really good payoff?
[3:57:04] <penitentpendant> Way too many flashbacks as loading screens
[3:57:06] <stabbityrabbit> It's the emotional state of BOREDOM.
[3:57:07] <KaiserMario> Well... You ARE a ginger, so...
[3:57:08] <sausagesausage> ResidentSleeper
[3:57:08] <%sosuke5> This ain't no five nights at freddy's
[3:57:08] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt When
[3:57:08] <%Dementedpenguin> Remember when this game said at the beginning to not play to win? Looks like Pat doing a good job winning. LUL
[3:57:09] <+raddkern> scary birthday
[3:57:11] <%juxtest> Maybe the orb knows why the tank fell through the floor
[3:57:12] <HotMafia81> Not anywhere close to the requisite 1000 eemoshuns
[3:57:12] <%maskofmichael> Was this game made by David Cage?
[3:57:13] <+lazysaiyajin> thats comical
[3:57:14] <Octocon> EMOTtionless psaUp
[3:57:14] <%Grandnatics> FantasTIC lore
[3:57:14] <+HitchhikingThrough> @PatStaresAt Hear me out: What if you played Hades instead
[3:57:15] <%AncelDeLambert> these flashbacks to happy times with the happy baby don't really aid the development of a tense, frightening atmosphere
[3:57:15] <%Cozy90> THATS NOT HOW CAKES WORK
[3:57:16] <%slimmixrp> So much stuff is scripted I'm baffled as to whether or nto youre doing it right
[3:57:16] <mattatatatatatatat> pat stop hiding how scared u are
[3:57:19] <yourliteraldog> I've never seen you so bored tbh
[3:57:20] <tolloponik> the jump scares are getting me more
[3:57:21] <%ssjklyco> Was that a womb?
[3:57:21] <nilla_24> it's kind of the same thing always
[3:57:22] <zettig> are you frigthened yet?
[3:57:24] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt When's Nioh 2 instead f this
[3:57:25] <Guardiansaiyan> @SoFarFetched ah...damn...maybe next year they can be half off?
[3:57:25] <%jyeowa> @PatStaresAt haven't seen you this bored since tlou2
[3:57:25] <Noogiez> yo
[3:57:27] <Parapattern> Are you attached to the fetus you know nothing about?
[3:57:27] <%Broand> but she's french how does she know how to swim
[3:57:30] <%luftraumm1> I'd enjoy playing this on my own I guess, maybe if I didn't pay for it
[3:57:31] <Bigyanno> I feel like it's trying to shove emotional moments at you without earning them
[3:57:31] <+redthebaron> like the 90s movie sound design does not add to the atmosphere
[3:57:32] <+ItalianWaifu> village is going to be burned down i bet
[3:57:33] <+Warden_Wolfie> So its a bad game huh
[3:57:33] <%Grandnatics> 10 dead babies, I guess?
[3:57:36] <RickSaintRiot> oooh maybe the Ghost is the Dead Kid
[3:57:38] <%Agami23> hey so i just got in, hows the game?
[3:57:38] <%captain_thickthighs> that baby has got to be spam at this point
[3:57:41] <%Broand> Feel free to riff
[3:57:42] <+LunarDensetsu> Phasmo too BIG for Pats
[3:57:42] <+GundamF91> Was someone pregnant during this games development and just really wanna do that plotline
[3:57:42] <$dellakitty> gross hands
[3:57:43] <+lazysaiyajin> 4 HOURS IN
[3:57:43] <%Anime_Flux> walk it off, lady
[3:57:45] <+HitchhikingThrough> wat
[3:57:45] <ranarath> You had more emotion for SH Homecoming. Granted, it was hatred, but still.
[3:57:47] <+HitchhikingThrough> What
[3:57:48] <kingjames7789> Oh now shes hurt
[3:57:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> lets give it a smidge more
[3:57:49] <%luftraumm1> not a bad game I guess
[3:57:51] <$Mdub98> this feels like shitty outlast
[3:57:51] <RickSaintRiot> the Ghost is your BEYOND TWO SOULS tether
[3:57:51] <%walternatorz> baby's fine
[3:57:51] <%NovaKnightmare> BABY DEAD
[3:57:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Walk it off fetus.
[3:57:52] <yourliteraldog> Hasn't it given you a spookin
[3:57:53] <%abusywizard> ngl this game doesn't seem nearly as successful as i'd hoped it'd be
[3:57:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> see what happens here
[3:57:54] <+Warden_Wolfie> Walk it off
[3:57:54] <+HitchhikingThrough> What is going on
[3:57:55] <+RowenCleric> French are like rats, and we all know rats cant swim
[3:57:55] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Every horror game reaches a point where the scariness turns to annoyance/tedium but this one probably had that happen the fastest for me
[3:57:55] <%Quigsies> I'm so... bored
[3:57:58] <%chiluzza> is she teen pregnant?
[3:58:00] <%juxtest> She has to have fallen to the bottom of the whole world by now
[3:58:01] <dredayah> no way that baby ok
[3:58:02] <HotMafia81> Oh NOW she thinks of the fetus
[3:58:02] <@SoFarFetched> @Guardiansaiyan Depends, it's up to Pat on if he changes it back or not, since he chose to put it at 20k.
[3:58:02] <+sixcubit> the womb worms can withstand any impact
[3:58:04] <%Grandnatics> Tap B@
[3:58:04] <+redthebaron> baby is baby there
[3:58:06] <Cymen90> @PatStaresAt You cannot relate because you are not a pregnant woman
[3:58:06] <gamewarden92> !BABY BROKE!
[3:58:08] <+Warden_Wolfie> Oof kids dead
[3:58:08] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> This lady is nuts
[3:58:09] <%luftraumm1> kind of a 6/10 on setting and graphics alone
[3:58:09] <DensityD> it's David Cage all over again
[3:58:09] <+tussletoes> that's some Jurassic park trespasser shit. pregnant cam.
[3:58:10] <animaspark> can the tumor please say something so we can continue?
[3:58:13] <+Warden_Wolfie> Fuck those kids
[3:58:13] <%AncelDeLambert> what is the POINT of this?
[3:58:14] <sausagesausage> Pats Face LUL
[3:58:14] <DensityD> we'll never be free
[3:58:14] <+HitchhikingThrough> @PatStaresAt did...we set up a reason to care about the baby?
[3:58:16] <hot_take_jake> I don't particularly care for preggo undead's magical mountain journey
[3:58:16] <%sosuke5> The baybee
[3:58:16] <mattatatatatatatat> shes talking to the steak she ate earlier
[3:58:16] <+Urgotfantasy> SOOTHE BB
[3:58:18] <%Anime_Flux> Aiden??
[3:58:18] <%chiluzza> BABY IS DEMON
[3:58:19] <Guardiansaiyan> @SoFarFetched ooooh...okay! Thanks for answering!
[3:58:19] <tattleworm> how is babby formed
[3:58:20] <Emperor_Mittens> I'm hating this game the longer it goes on.
[3:58:20] <+Dragon4234> Pat can't empathize with women confirmed
[3:58:21] <%AncelDeLambert> What am I meant to be FEELING??
[3:58:22] <+J_Papa> You need to get the stomach parasite out
[3:58:24] <+mccf> F for baby
[3:58:25] <+ItalianWaifu> this game is so nothing
[3:58:26] <%za7az> Why do we care???
[3:58:27] <Saltmeisterr> THE BABY
[3:58:29] <olm46> She tried real hard to abort it.
[3:58:29] <+HitchhikingThrough> ....Amnesia devs confirmed pro life?
[3:58:30] <kool450> satan baby LUL
[3:58:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> 👀

[3:58:31] <HotMafia81> Can anyone name one of our main character's personality traits?
[3:58:32] <Wyrmsblood> I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR BABY
[3:58:33] <+redthebaron> press f to soothe baby
[3:58:33] <+CannonHeroBrett> B A B Y
[3:58:35] <LunarRemix> ...Maybe this game works better for mothers
[3:58:35] <$Wnds> that water doesn't look good monkaS
[3:58:35] <mattatatatatatatat> its like that baby in twilight
[3:58:35] <%Cozy90> THE BABY
[3:58:36] <+VoxelFox51> bleh, im glad I waited on this one...kinda mediorce
[3:58:37] <$Mdub98> This would be way cooler with BB instead
[3:58:39] <Parapattern> Are you attached to ze baby yet?
[3:58:41] <gamewarden92> please no more cave
[3:58:41] <kool450> f
[3:58:41] <yourliteraldog> This probably the most" Pro-Life" videogame i've ever seen
[3:58:42] <+Warden_Wolfie> never have we seen such weird baby shit than this and DMC devil may not cry
[3:58:42] <DensityD> I bet it's a ritual site

[3:58:53] <+HitchhikingThrough> man the new black mesa update looks sick
[3:58:54] <RetroCop87> THAT WATER'S FLOWING UPHILL
[3:58:54] <%maskofmichael> Wrong, she can probably do better without a baby right now
[3:58:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> You know what, if the game was doing that, but didn't take control away from the player, I may have actually felt something, but I was just annoyed that it took control away again.
[3:58:56] <kingjames7789> it can only go up form here right guys ?
[3:58:57] <%Broand> YOU DONT WANT IT TO HUSH THO
[3:58:58] <SatoruMasamune> And then the Kool-Aid Man bursts out of her stomach in an eruption of gore, screaming "OH YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAH!"
[3:58:58] <%walternatorz> just a little baby concussion, we're still good
[3:58:59] <soraabora> oh no she's super losing it
[3:59:01] <mattatatatatatatat> lullabys r scary
[3:59:01] <RickSaintRiot> I really really want it to stop taking control away from the player. please for heaven's sake, Frictional
[3:59:01] <dredayah> or a town with caves
[3:59:01] <LunarRemix> This kind of reminds me how Half Life tbh
[3:59:04] <jorniev> THE BABY IS TOTALLY TENTACLES
[3:59:04] <DensityD> gul

[3:59:58] <%walternatorz> you have to yell at them, otherwise they're allowed to haunt you
[3:59:59] <Wyrmsblood> If Paige was playing, she would have killed this lady by now.
[4:00:00] <+DeltascapeV4> Is this the "She was dead all along" story?
[4:00:02] <%Dementedpenguin> @mattatatatatatatat oh my god
[4:00:04] <olm46> Oughta recommend this to Paige if this lady's belly suffers any more abuse.

[4:00:43] <Crimpson> Crickey
[4:00:46] <Wyrmsblood> A MACHINE FOR BABIES
[4:00:50] <%luftraumm1> trust the nice djinn woman
[4:00:50] <RickSaintRiot> I liked the daytime horror in Tremors and Texas Chainsaw Massacre
[4:00:51] <$Mdub98> I’ve never been more bored with a horror game
[4:00:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Didn't the game talk about a spirit that tries to help people, or did Pat forget he read that in the log he skipped over?
[4:00:53] <kingjames7789> can you fuck the ghost ?
[4:00:55] <+mccf> Ok now here we go
[4:00:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I assume...we're midway through? Hopefully? 2/3rds?
[4:00:57] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Do the forced flashbacks that take away your control add to the spook factor?
[4:01:01] <animaspark> thigs got hopefull???
[4:01:04] <+HitchhikingThrough> ...isn't part of the appeal of Amnesia that the person is insane and you don't know how real anything is? Or am I just misinformed
[4:01:07] <mattatatatatatatat> can french people fuck ghosts?
[4:01:12] <$LiquidShake83> ask the ghost for a date
[4:01:13] <DensityD> Dr Anton Metzier is sus. vote Dr Anton
[4:01:16] <DensityD> I saw him vent
[4:01:21] <kingjames7789> @HitchhikingThrough no your right
[4:01:24] <%AncelDeLambert> @mattatatatatatatat I mean, they can TRY
[4:01:25] <%Piemono> So time shit seems to be the main mystery here
[4:01:31] <gamewarden92> @CommanderSqueaks There was a bit in a note about a "Ashen Djinn" that helps people
[4:01:33] <kool450> dat ghost be looking pretty sus
[4:01:34] <+GundamF91> Maybe this has a big hook
[4:01:35] <%Niney_Who> Ghul
[4:01:41] <+Terrarp> Does this game has a thing like the first Amnesia where if you spent too much time in the dark your character started to hallucinate?
[4:01:41] <+tussletoes> it's the bagool!
[4:01:43] <+HitchhikingThrough> unironically a Ghoul
[4:01:46] <animaspark> so the monster is just a zombie?
[4:01:47] <$Mdub98> Man RE 8 looks fucking great rn
[4:01:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gamewarden92 Yeaup
[4:01:52] <sausagesausage> ghul steamer
[4:01:52] <%AFlyingTaco1> It sure didn't try eating her flesh
[4:01:55] <Teras_ode> ghûl
[4:01:56] <kool450> did you say ragoool
[4:01:58] <@SoFarFetched> ooooooooooooohhhhhh
[4:01:59] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Terrarp it sure does, and it sure isn't that scarry
[4:02:01] <RickSaintRiot> @Terrarp Seems to be: yes.
[4:02:01] <DensityD> I wonder what's going on in ghost chat. I hope the ghosts are completing their tasks
[4:02:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but at what cost?
[4:02:09] <kingjames7789> @Terrarp yeah
[4:02:09] <mattatatatatatatat> is shakespeare spirit meant cum lolol
[4:02:12] <yourliteraldog> fuck its just a zombie\
[4:02:16] <yourliteraldog> Lame
[4:02:17] <%luftraumm1> uhmmmmm
[4:02:19] <+tussletoes> i'm sure this is a good idea.
[4:02:22] <Schlongalong> i thought we were yasmin
[4:02:23] <@SoFarFetched> This may explain some things
[4:02:26] <RickSaintRiot> zombies are cool
[4:02:27] <+raddkern> desert wendigo
[4:02:27] <kingjames7789> zombie ghost ?
[4:02:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> A key aspect of horror being effective is the player being immersed in the situation, yanking control away from the player at every other opportunity does not help do that.
[4:02:34] <Thirtine> hmmmm

[4:08:53] <+ItalianWaifu> subtle
[4:08:54] <Goodvibes99508> DO YOU GET THE ALLEGORY?????
[4:08:54] <Wyrmsblood> Nothing ominous about this temple's architecture.
[4:08:56] <animaspark> the day someone reads something thats not alice in wonderland ill fart
[4:08:58] <RickSaintRiot> actually it's Flatland
[4:08:58] <mutantlunchbox1> what if the monke is the real baby?
[4:09:01] <kool450> this some lovecraftan stuff rite here LUL
[4:09:02] <%AFlyingTaco1> I will also pee then
[4:09:02] <%AzureGale> Pat has to pee so he doesn't pee out of fear on stream
[4:09:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat got too excited at there finally being video game.
[4:09:05] <penitentpendant> The true pregnancy experience! Peeing every coupla minutes!
[4:09:10] <Bigyanno> Man has small bladder
[4:09:11] <kingjames7789> so what do you guys rate this game as of right now ?
[4:09:14] <soraabora> I feel like dark descent also took a little while to warm up right?
[4:09:14] <RickSaintRiot> tbh that's relatively subtle. It's just a quote from the book
[4:09:22] <%AzureGale> 7/9
[4:09:25] <TuxedoNash> man fuck lewis carrol
[4:09:25] <yourliteraldog> needs to empty his balls
[4:09:25] <penitentpendant> 2/10 Bad Pacing
[4:09:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @kingjames7789 The last 10 minutes legit added .5 points
[4:09:32] <%Anime_Flux> Devs: "You know what gamers like? Babies. Let's make the whole game about 'em. They'll love it."
[4:09:32] <RickSaintRiot> did the book show the title Alice in Wonderland?
[4:09:35] <+Enzo991> Man this music slaps hard
[4:09:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Anime_Flux I mean it worked for Death Stranding.
[4:09:47] <kingjames7789> @AzureGale really ? that generous
[4:09:56] <%umbypokochan> the game is better if you pretend she's talking to chat instead of the baby
[4:09:58] <RickSaintRiot> funnily, there's not a single actual baby so far.
[4:10:01] <TheMyriadGamer> @soraabora To me Dark Descent took maybe 3 hours before it started to get fun
[4:10:07] <%Anime_Flux> @CommanderSqueaks Point taken
[4:10:15] <RickSaintRiot> how long till baby
[4:10:28] <%AFlyingTaco1> Hah! I can pee faster than Pat can!
[4:10:38] <penitentpendant> @RickSaintRiot 9 months of subs
[4:10:40] <DensityD> amazing talent
[4:10:42] <DensityD> what a skill
[4:10:44] <TheMyriadGamer> usually 9 months for a baby
[4:10:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @CommanderSqueaks yeah, but they gave you cool babies. Didn't tease you with baby no shows.
[4:10:47] <DensityD> I bet your legs are longer too
[4:10:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, don't forget that the monster in Amnesia 1 was GOOFY looking. The whole reason it was scary was because the screen blurred so you couldn't get a good look at it when it was close.
[4:11:07] <RickSaintRiot> it's pretty gross up close tbh
[4:11:10] <%walternatorz> is pat doing a pee poop?
[4:11:15] <DensityD> it was a good visual technique to hide the monster
[4:11:17] <kingjames7789> you saying the brute was goofy looking ?
[4:11:23] <RickSaintRiot> walks like a drunk guy with a lame foot though
[4:11:24] <+raddkern> what if the twist is the baby was behind it all along?
[4:11:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> That fucker was dorky, yes.
[4:11:29] <TuxedoNash> There's like three of them, not counting the invisible guy
[4:11:31] <animaspark> but this one is just a splindly jhonny looking jackass and theres no blur, so what do we get from this?
[4:11:36] <Bigyanno> Pat has peed all over his balls so he has to wash them now
[4:11:36] <+Dragon4234> @CommanderSqueaks Ah excuse you? That was due to the very real sanity effect
[4:11:46] <RickSaintRiot> I remember how metal the Suitors looked from Justine
[4:11:49] <penitentpendant> @kingjames7789 His design made me think of "Hey guyths!"
[4:11:52] <DensityD> a sideways melting fish face monster
[4:11:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @animaspark Patch it blur, obviously.
[4:11:55] <TheMyriadGamer> @CommanderSqueaks the first monster was honestly hilarious, the second acta monster was kinda spooky, and the water monster still gives me goosebumbs.
[4:11:57] <@SoFarFetched> I remember the enemy in Amnesia being called Mr Flappy
[4:11:58] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @CommanderSqueaks yeah it was a muppet
[4:12:05] <kingjames7789> which did you guys perfer in dd the grunt or the brute
[4:12:15] <Cody2394> Looked like the things from Until Dawn
[4:12:15] <DensityD> water monster 10/10
[4:12:26] <RickSaintRiot> the SUITORS from JUSTINE
[4:12:29] <TheMyriadGamer> @DakotaMacDoodle Big bird is scarier than the Grunt
[4:12:32] <penitentpendant> Water monster was the 'scariest' for certain
[4:12:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> I am utterly convinced Frictional is terrible at monster design, so they should do all that they can to never let you get a good look at the model.
[4:12:40] <%AFlyingTaco1> Wendigos are basically snow ghouls after all
[4:12:46] <sausagesausage> song slaps
[4:12:47] <%DakotaMacDoodle> true
[4:12:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @penitentpendant And that fucker was invisible.
[4:12:55] <$joylent_blue> SourPls
[4:12:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> water monster was pretty alright, plus how to get around it. Floor is lava but with water.
[4:13:01] <TheMyriadGamer> I already have a fear of water in games, that damn monster made me shake while playing it.
[4:13:02] <kingjames7789> @CommanderSqueaks the monsters in soma were cool tho
[4:13:06] <animaspark> never would have come the day that i would miss the barrels
[4:13:06] <kool450> hey remember the giant worm from penumbra
[4:13:10] <Guardiansaiyan> Mr. Struts from Amnesia Dark Descent was scariest monster
[4:13:15] <penitentpendant> @CommanderSqueaks Which is why it was actually scary
[4:13:16] <%Anime_Flux> Yeah the monster in this game is just a generic Halloween-store goon
[4:13:23] <RickSaintRiot> i don't think the monster designs are bad at all
[4:13:27] <ssks123> i missed the water monster, was it the same one from amnesia 1
[4:13:28] <DensityD> @CommanderSqueaks would you say that monster design and monster positioning are separate, but equal skills?
[4:13:30] <ssks123> or was it the ghoul
[4:13:35] <+HitchhikingThrough> Monster being in the water here was cool...up until the point where it took 30 seconds for pat to unbar that tunnel and the monster just...didn't catch up?
[4:13:37] <RickSaintRiot> we're just spoiled for great designs these days
[4:13:39] <TheMyriadGamer> @kool450 probably the least scary thing in that game, but thats not a bad thing
[4:13:39] <%Archphronimos> Archphronimos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Take my Bezos bucks you glorious goblin man!
[4:13:43] <DensityD> I guess monster positioning = level design and AI
[4:13:46] <%umbypokochan> i'm more scared of flying at night in the rain over water in FFXIV than I am of monsters
[4:13:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there was no water monster in this.
[4:13:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> The fact that they let you get several really good looks at this monster is a terrible decision on their part.
[4:14:02] <kool450> @TheMyriadGamer still better than these ghuls
[4:14:05] <RickSaintRiot> @HitchhikingThrough tbf, pat didn't look behind him, so we have no idea what on earth the monster was occupied with
[4:14:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> That I can recall...honestly I blacked out at some point, I was that bored, I fell halfway asleep.
[4:14:10] <animaspark> no water monster, just monster in water
[4:14:17] <%Anime_Flux> The water chase earlier wasn't too bad, probably because you couldn't see what was chasing you
[4:14:22] <penitentpendant> @CommanderSqueaks And one of those moment is just a good look at its butt didn't help the fear factor at all
[4:14:28] <kingjames7789> maybe we`re the water monsters
[4:14:33] <RickSaintRiot> haven't really *tested* the deaths yet
[4:14:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like, the crawling in hole moment might have been scary if they just showed it's foot disappearing or something, not let you watch it struggle with its fat ass to crawl in for several seconds.
[4:14:36] <DensityD> big monster butt
[4:14:37] <Guardiansaiyan> yes
[4:14:38] <TheMyriadGamer> @kool450 The zombies in Dying Light are scarier than these things
[4:14:51] <kool450> @kingjames7789 inception music plays
[4:14:55] <RickSaintRiot> Would be nice if Amnesia took the Look Behind You mechanic from Outlast
[4:14:56] <penitentpendant> If anything this feels like a horror game Plague should play, and lampshade viciously
[4:14:59] <DensityD> the thickest dumptruck monster ass
[4:14:59] <gamewarden92> But what do you guys rate the monster's ass though?
[4:15:03] <+HitchhikingThrough> I see the outline of a monster, I get spooked. I see a whole monster, I start wondering where my super shotgun is
[4:15:03] <Bigyanno> Did Pat get distracted by puppy?
[4:15:04] <kingjames7789> oh man i wish dying light 2 would come out already
[4:15:07] <animaspark> the crawling in the hole would've been cool if it wasnt right in front of us
[4:15:09] <DensityD> 8/10 thicc
[4:15:12] <kingjames7789> yes
[4:15:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gamewarden92 2/10, too flat.
[4:15:14] <kool450> @TheMyriadGamer true
[4:15:15] <+HitchhikingThrough> 6/10. Seen better, seen worse

[4:28:10] <+HitchhikingThrough> uhhh
[4:28:15] <HotMafia81> @PatStaresAt is there a formula in sympathy with your orb?
[4:28:19] <RickSaintRiot> it was the alien nuclear weapons
[4:28:20] <Bigyanno> The red flesh? The HUMAN flesh?
[4:28:22] <%luftraumm1> those tablets can be read
[4:28:23] <DensityD> the pulsing of the orb, harness the red flesh
[4:28:23] <$joylent_blue> evil ass chair

[4:28:28] <animaspark> some eldritch, rhleyan choggot thingamabob of a alien?
[4:28:28] <KaiserMario> Yo, is Agrippa around?
[4:28:28] <+HitchhikingThrough> Our factories can only make EVIL chairs
[4:28:28] <DensityD> it's dicks, all the way down
[4:28:29] <%donkymagooterson> society just may have been built on the fear of the masses?
[4:28:30] <tattleworm> all for orb
[4:28:33] <Bigyanno> I'd own that chair
[4:28:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> They thought it'd be HILARIOUS
[4:28:35] <%Profmcstevie> Acquiring vitae in Amnesia 1 was often through torture
[4:28:37] <soraabora> this city had an aesthetic and I can respect that
[4:28:38] <RickSaintRiot> doesn't say human flesh. the red flesh is weird stuff
[4:28:39] <%Laecerelius> Society died for flesh orb
[4:28:39] <%redthebaron> she is not coming back either way
[4:28:40] <sakeydo> POOOOWER!

[4:28:59] <RickSaintRiot> i'm telling you, this is lovely sci-fi.
[4:29:24] <%BluBarracuda> has anyone else played this and kept corpse lady alive? is that possible?
[4:29:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> She seemed like she was a vegetable, so I'm not sure she was living beyond the scientific definition of alive.
[4:29:34] <animaspark> now solve the puzzle
[4:29:35] <%luftraumm1> you know, having a big section of the game in an hegelian french fort was a great setup for this
[4:29:46] <Visorak6> put cubes in receptacle?
[4:29:46] <%Anime_Flux> Why the hell wasn't this the whole game? This is so much cooler.
[4:29:47] <DensityD> keep trying

[4:39:24] <%redthebaron> probably did them before the recordings
[4:39:24] <guiltyboya> Sainte Marie mère de Dieu
[4:39:25] <KaiserMario> the jank is real
[4:39:25] <RickSaintRiot> That's normal subtitle / recording stuff.
[4:39:26] <+VoxelFox51> Bad Directors
[4:39:26] <Zooperton> subtitles are haunted
[4:39:27] <yourliteraldog> Is this game orginally in french
[4:39:28] <%Agami23> normally thats a translation thing but i dont think that applies to this.
[4:39:28] <$joylent_blue> its part of the sanity effects :)
[4:39:28] <+Enzo991> Subtitles based on an old script
[4:39:28] <silentblast93> your now 8 months preganant
[4:39:29] <rekinom> Used to watch VoDs with my GF when we both had free time, and now have to pay for the privilege. Cool.

[4:39:35] <%MechArch> is this a preggo simulator?
[4:39:38] <Bigyanno> Clearly they didn't update the script
[4:39:40] <stagnetti> You can tell that the baby is a 5 Star based on its growth rate
[4:39:40] <%jyeowa> at least it's not avenger's level jank. you know, like [AGREEABLE GRUNT]
[4:39:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> we bout to either abort or give birth
[4:39:41] <HotMafia81> I don't like the slow subtitles. Just make them shorter if her line takes forever.
[4:39:44] <RickSaintRiot> I've never seen game subtitles that were perfect. except Diablo, of course.
[4:39:46] <$RealThiele> oh my

[4:43:08] <%transporterthesequel> That baby does not sound like baby no more

[4:43:21] <%realm_forge> You found the hunter from bloodbourne
[4:43:24] <+HitchhikingThrough> @DensityD UR RIGHT
[4:43:25] <Bigyanno> generally getting bigger is what happens in pregnancy
[4:43:30] <$joylent_blue> otherwise how is she not busting the fuck out of it
[4:43:33] <%Valdorick> Ha HA
[4:43:35] <Parapattern> Are you going back in the castle?

[4:43:42] <+HitchhikingThrough> Incidentally this seems like a great time to push animorphs
[4:43:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Bailey__gaming This game has been really mediocre until about the last hour, but now it's getting kinda good.
[4:43:46] <RickSaintRiot> pregnancy is just another step in our HUGE QUEST

[4:44:43] <+corrosivePaladin> yes lul
[4:44:43] <stagnetti> You can tell its a 5 star baby because its DEF stat is so high
[4:44:46] <Thewoodentree> This is 10 flights of stairs the kid is dead
[4:44:46] <%secretspud> this hole was made for you
[4:44:46] <DashXero> Jumpscare JPEG sounds like a Megaman X boss.
[4:44:50] <LoneFonte> Alien beans
[4:44:51] <%captain_thickthighs> this is a good like a placenta thing
[4:44:53] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt How's Paige btw? Still cool and powerful?
[4:44:54] <%BluBarracuda> interdimensional SPERM
[4:44:56] <%Dementedpenguin> I've never seen a game with so much intentional falling.
[4:44:59] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt It's the Shadow from the first game, which chases Daniel
[4:44:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> ... 'Survived'
[4:45:00] <+HitchhikingThrough> that's not terrible provided there ANY unavoidable damage
[4:45:02] <Crimpson> Yay for beans
[4:45:03] <%transporterthesequel> Wait baby DEFEATED BEANS
[4:45:03] <%slimmixrp> Why her eye like that
[4:45:03] <xxshadowxx416> so fast waddling
[4:45:04] <Parapattern> Yep, bean poisoning. Terminal.
[4:45:05] <%Profmcstevie> An existence of PURE beans
[4:45:05] <silentblast93> beans are deadlt
[4:45:06] <yourliteraldog> More specifically a shaggoth
[4:45:08] <RickSaintRiot> I'm sorry, your child is allergic to beans.
[4:45:08] <trianglehat> and strong
[4:45:08] <soraabora> allergy to beans no more beans
[4:45:09] <animaspark> but did the beans survive the kid?
[4:45:09] <%Piemen99> IMPOSSIBLE
[4:45:09] <$KnivesEve> !uptime
[4:45:09] <sausagesausage> :)
[4:45:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 45m.
[4:45:10] <+HitchhikingThrough> But they have black eyes though
[4:45:10] <penitentpendant> Hey, the baby in the load screen corner is bigger
[4:45:13] <%condemned_15> Peach Chungus
[4:45:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Bean Survivor status established
[4:45:15] <Zooperton> Only the strongest children survive THE BEANS
[4:45:15] <$RealThiele> tension gone
[4:45:17] <zettig> Is Paige's spine made of beans?
[4:45:19] <%Grandnatics> Can Paige handle beans?
[4:45:22] <+HitchhikingThrough> @penitentpendant THATS PRETTY GOOD
[4:45:22] <Wyrmsblood> Paige's dick grew three sizes that day
[4:45:24] <Bigyanno> Beans aren't murderous after all. Praise beans
[4:45:27] <+corrosivePaladin> is it even real damage?
[4:45:30] <LoneFonte> But you didn't go through a portal last time, right?
[4:45:30] <yourliteraldog> Less preg
[4:45:31] <DensityD> abort it
[4:45:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Wyrmsblood Like a hyena?
[4:45:33] <EternalJedi> more Stargate!
[4:45:33] <%redthebaron> the baby has nothing to do with this
[4:45:37] <$joylent_blue> lady that thing is NOT your baby
[4:45:39] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat is that pocket watch as cool as the obra dinn one?
[4:45:39] <RickSaintRiot> "oh, la pauvre! le docteur, we are, how you say, ze Bean Eating Familee"
[4:45:39] <$KnivesEve> how far is pat into this?
[4:45:42] <olm46> It's for pinball.
[4:45:43] <DensityD> big brain pat
[4:45:45] <Thewoodentree> That kid is going to be the fucking anti christ
[4:45:46] <animaspark> and why is my belly bigger but my boobs stay the same?
[4:45:51] <%transporterthesequel> Wait I think this is in the normal dimension.
[4:45:51] <sausagesausage> teleporter PogChamp
[4:45:53] <Visorak6> BIG stargate
[4:45:53] <$joylent_blue> KnivesEve roughly 4 hours
[4:45:55] <+HitchhikingThrough> @PatStaresAt I think you reentered the fucked up world at some point
[4:45:57] <%juxtest> The beans brought you here, but for what purpose
[4:45:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ....this kinda felt like...this shit was ripped away and then stitched together, these shifts are so different in tone.
[4:45:58] <penitentpendant> @KnivesEve Second trimester, 4 hours in
[4:46:01] <$RealThiele> Fetus Deletus!
[4:46:02] <wibbwobbler> some kind of machine for pigs i reckon
[4:46:04] <%redthebaron> BIGGER ORB
[4:46:05] <DensityD> this is not shadow puzzles 2nd gig, thank god, and pat is good at puzzle
[4:46:07] <sausagesausage> DONT DO IT
[4:46:08] <RickSaintRiot> I think it's weird for the French to say Monsieur Le Docteur instead of Monsieur Docteur.
[4:46:14] <olm46> "I can't see, I'm in your belly, lady!"
[4:46:16] <+HitchhikingThrough> TIME TO INFECT THE WORLD WITH ALL THE GOO
[4:46:18] <DianaTheAscian> u put into ours?
[4:46:20] <blink289> Since when did you have to sub to watch past broadcasts?
[4:46:23] <%Dementedpenguin> "I know it's crazy." You say that 3 hours in?
[4:46:23] <DianaTheAscian> it*
[4:46:24] <%Piemen99> @KnivesEve 4 hours and 45 min
[4:46:28] <%bassoontyphoon> the place you were passing through looked like the castle in amnesia
[4:46:29] <%Jekado> fucking Astranomican up in here
[4:46:29] <gamewarden92> I think using the orb is a bad idea.
[4:46:30] <penitentpendant> She is becoming Orb
[4:46:31] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Best case scenario shes alone, pregnant, and in the desert
[4:46:33] <DensityD> levers?
[4:46:37] <yourliteraldog> there was blue portal somewhere in that chase
[4:46:40] <Bigyanno> Yeah that's a great idea, bring the goo into a town
[4:46:43] <doughboidankweed> psaCaco
[4:46:47] <Goodvibes99508> this isn't an alternative world its the future
[4:46:51] <Jalexster> Maybe the whole structure you're in right now physically jumps between dimensions, and that's how it ended up here?
[4:46:52] <doughboidankweed> hehehe troll pat
[4:46:54] <%Axellogic> Make the Orb bigger thats the solution
[4:46:56] <%Anime_Flux> pargon pargon pargon
[4:46:56] <%Broand> I didn't
[4:46:58] <penitentpendant> Every time she's time jumped she's bumped up a trimester
[4:47:00] <DensityD> pregnant women can't jump? didn't you used to have a jump?
[4:47:03] <+Kurt_0> Is this game good
[4:47:03] <%Axellogic> Make more bigger orbs
[4:47:04] <Wyrmsblood> The orb is a metaphor for vagina
[4:47:08] <$zackalan> @patstaresat the orb is a reverse Plan B pill
[4:47:10] <$RealThiele> use protection before you orb kids
[4:47:11] <LoneFonte> "Whoops, all beans"
[4:47:13] <RickSaintRiot> @blink289 some kind of takedown bot-related reason, i believe
[4:47:17] <sausagesausage> sbfpSetIn
[4:47:20] <+HitchhikingThrough> oh yeah, normal paper
[4:47:21] <Bigyanno> Have you ever seen a 6 month pregnant woman jump?
[4:47:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Now that's not thinking with portals.
[4:47:22] <knightnoah> Can’t wait for the 3 hour long lore vids about this game
[4:47:25] <%realm_forge> Doom guy wouldn’t deal with this shit
[4:47:26] <%AzureGale> Fluid
[4:47:27] <+HitchhikingThrough> so what the fuck is going on?
[4:47:29] <soraabora> this is like the dudes inner sanctum

[4:48:29] <Wyrmsblood> This should have been the game from the start
[4:48:29] <RickSaintRiot> it's a modern excavation of an ancient thing.
[4:48:29] <jorniev> is the plot twist gonna be that you are a surrogate mom for an alien?
[4:48:30] <%redthebaron> are we still on algeirs
[4:48:31] <Wyrmsblood> Minus the pregnant
[4:48:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat ignores the big shiny

[4:49:37] <scottjefferson2punto0> oh shet! the stone of bernenburg!
[4:49:39] <zettig> Beans are just tiny malformed orbs
[4:49:42] <penitentpendant> Do you think the previous section redeemed this game enough to keep it on the schedule?
[4:49:44] <Wyrmsblood> FLASHBACK
[4:49:44] <wibbwobbler> cool
[4:49:45] <Visorak6> Its hilarious how the dark world is a shot in the arm every time this game gets boring

[4:50:38] <Jalexster> @silverira Herbert made it across to the other world and left notes. The stuff written by the natives on the other side seems to inject language directly into your brain
[4:50:41] <penitentpendant> So far 'The Darkness' is the only threatening evil so far
[4:50:41] <Thewoodentree> Maybe its Alexanders the Greats lost tomb?
[4:50:43] <HotMafia81> Oh he gon get out of here alright

[4:51:15] <%redthebaron> what a bad sound
[4:51:15] <+raddkern> i have a feeling this game really wants us to grow attached to the baby
[4:51:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> Goop?

[4:51:25] <%bassoontyphoon> some monster is eating beans in there
[4:51:26] <%Buzzard42> BEANS
[4:51:26] <+jaggler> some one muching on some human bean
[4:51:27] <%Broand> Old beans
[4:51:32] <animaspark> thats the last door holding the beans
[4:51:32] <%ssjklyco> Mr Green Beans
[4:51:37] <%Grandnatics> It had too much CROUNCH for beans
[4:51:42] <%redthebaron> look at baby
[4:51:42] <Thewoodentree> Those were some bad beans
[4:51:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> has the game got spoopy yet
[4:51:43] <Parapattern> Humans are just complex beans
[4:51:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> is there some kid of physics based puzzle?
[4:51:45] <wibbwobbler> fear the old beans
[4:51:47] <%Broand> Looks like her daughter was... living beyond her beans
[4:51:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> *kind
[4:51:50] <+HitchhikingThrough> Cuz those are ionic columns, and I don't think the romans used them
[4:51:54] <+Promessa_EX> Someone eating beans
[4:51:55] <penitentpendant> Notably slower climbing speed
[4:51:58] <guiltyboya> FEAR THE OLD BEANS
[4:51:58] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Broand booooooooooooooooo
[4:52:01] <Bigyanno> go rub the statue's penises in reverence
[4:52:10] <kingjames7789> imma clock out gents ill catch the vod tommrow night yall
[4:52:11] <yourliteraldog> A real human bean
[4:52:12] <$joylent_blue> rumtumtugnutz spoopy no, interesting yeah
[4:52:13] <Jalexster> The sci-fi stuff is far more interesting than the classic horror stuff
[4:52:13] <sausagesausage> yeah FeelsBadMan
[4:52:14] <%luftraumm1> oh yeah it did
[4:52:20] <%Bailey__gaming> As you did for the vaccious heinz grant us beans,
[4:52:27] <SpectralTuna> Eldritch Bean!! SabaPing
[4:52:27] <+lazysaiyajin> mon coeur
[4:52:32] <yourliteraldog> And it was general cool
[4:52:35] <%slimmixrp> Eldritch daughter
[4:52:37] <$RealThiele> beans still dyin
[4:52:38] <animaspark> so this amnesia game is interesting when it isnt doing the amnesia thing?
[4:52:38] <%transporterthesequel> Oh no the BEANS WON IN THE END
[4:52:41] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> THeyre arent many enemies in this game either
[4:52:41] <susukouhai> is the green shit bean farts.
[4:52:42] <stagnetti> Has the game been not fun to play?
[4:52:47] <mimi777> Sad beans
[4:52:49] <%Buzzard42> yeah but it worked in Amnesia 1
[4:52:50] <olm46> And it didn't have a really boring hour-long intro.
[4:52:52] <%Buzzard42> and in Penumbra
[4:52:53] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[4:52:53] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt But Soma isn't a horror game tho
[4:52:55] <Jalexster> Yeah, but resource management is an essential part of horror games because it induces stress. However, it needs to be balanced very carefully
[4:52:59] <%Buzzard42> that's FUCKIN SICK
[4:52:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Why must the beans do this to us? WHY?!
[4:52:59] <%redthebaron> like literally she could take a torch out of the walls and use it for so long
[4:53:04] <%ssjklyco> The baby got the Paige desease
[4:53:04] <penitentpendant> I liked SOMA, but MAN did I hate the stupidity of the protagonist of that
[4:53:04] <%luftraumm1> but resource managing is a core game mechanic in the first game isn't it
[4:53:06] <animaspark> Bill?
[4:53:08] <sausagesausage> twin towers monkaS
[4:53:09] <DensityD> (it didn't work in Amnesia 1)
[4:53:11] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah that is pretty rad. Glad game is good now.
[4:53:20] <Jalexster> And in this case, I feel like... the game's setting and all the supernatural shit alone is enough to carry it without needing to rely on traditional horror stuff
[4:53:24] <%luftraumm1> big tho
[4:53:26] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Amnesia 2 had infinite lantern and it didn't help...
[4:53:27] <yourliteraldog> yup
[4:53:28] <sausagesausage> nvm theres 3
[4:53:29] <T_Sasquatch> Amnesia fucked-up horror games and their gameplay for years. There I said it
[4:53:29] <LoneFonte> but do it again tho
[4:53:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'll say this, they had some cool designs for the scenery.
[4:53:32] <$RealThiele> cast the heal spell
[4:53:34] <+jaggler> it' bigger for the bigger portal downstairs
[4:53:34] <Bigyanno> but BIGGER
[4:53:36] <+Promessa_EX> As long as it’s not oxygen management
[4:53:42] <+HitchhikingThrough> Oh damn it I thought the same person is on the phone
[4:53:48] <%redthebaron> no you did not told shit
[4:53:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yo doc WHAT THE FUCK

[4:54:19] <TuxedoNash> thanks for beating the game
[4:54:20] <gamewarden92> Alright
[4:54:21] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Did it seem generic to you?
[4:54:22] <DensityD> the moon is, indeed, an orb
[4:54:23] <+baka_sugoi> Opinions??
[4:54:23] <Guardiansaiyan> nothing much in there
[4:54:24] <Bigyanno> What if that evil eldritch dimension is actually inside the moon?
[4:54:25] <+Delanus_Turgias> it's also been like 5 hours
[4:54:26] <%Cozy90> PAT PLAY WORLD OF HORROR
[4:54:26] <penitentpendant> Needed better pacing
[4:54:26] <$RealThiele> orb is a period guys omg

[4:54:33] <scottjefferson2punto0> oh well, we tried
[4:54:33] <+AMagicalFlute> tru
[4:54:35] <%Buzzard42> LUL
[4:54:36] <%donkymagooterson> not terrible but not great
[4:54:36] <%weissguard> LUL
[4:54:36] <+Kurt_0> Did ya like it
[4:54:39] <+HitchhikingThrough> I mean fair, but it felt like it was getting better
[4:54:39] <+alex_id> You did it
[4:54:40] <%notgarza> LMAO
[4:54:40] <Bigyanno> but will you return to this?
[4:54:40] <sausagesausage> PogChamp LUL
[4:54:40] <T_Sasquatch> It's almost amnesia is a meme
[4:54:42] <+Delanus_Turgias> never back down: the back down
[4:54:42] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt disappointed or just got board?
[4:54:44] <%captain_thickthighs> so the game is called amnesia cuz it's forgettable
[4:54:44] <Guardiansaiyan> ZAPPING SYSTEM
[4:54:47] <Zooperton> pat got too scared
[4:54:49] <+dante_must_die_exe> it got the D R A M A and no S C A R E
[4:54:50] <%bassoontyphoon> this is a walking simulator with light horror elements
[4:54:53] <HotMafia81> There's no survival here
[4:54:54] <Bigyanno> that is BARELY survival horror
[4:54:54] <$RealThiele> walking simulator
[4:54:54] <%Buzzard42> ZAPPING SYSTEM
[4:54:56] <sausagesausage> cant fight back
[4:54:56] <+lazysaiyajin> this is shit
[4:54:57] <+Ocaz> its horror puzzle isnt it?
[4:54:58] <Wyrmsblood> Pat loves surviving
[4:54:58] <%condemned_15> semantics
[4:54:58] <Guardiansaiyan> VirtualHug ZAPPING SYSTEM VirtualHug
[4:54:59] <%juxtest> The beans win again
[4:55:02] <+SquishMittens7> Imagine calling this game "survival horror"
[4:55:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> Sillent hill 2
[4:55:03] <+Kurt_0> But pat loves resident
[4:55:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> this isn't a survival horror game
[4:55:04] <+Dragon4234> Is it because there's no zapping system
[4:55:05] <%redthebaron> this was barelly horror
[4:55:09] <hot_take_jake> this wasn't even horror; it was boring
[4:55:09] <%YakumoYomi> So...Fatal Frame 5 on Thursday instead?
[4:55:11] <T_Sasquatch> You don't like running away from some putz LUL
[4:55:12] <+lazysaiyajin> existential horror
[4:55:13] <Xelhesia> SOMA WAS THE SHIT
[4:55:13] <penitentpendant> In many ways this doesn't even feel like 'horror'
[4:55:15] <wibbwobbler> SOMA
[4:55:16] <%nofestu2> What if it had the zapping system?
[4:55:17] <Jalexster> @PatStaresAt Would it've been better if they dropped the horror angle entirely and went hard sci-fi?
[4:55:18] <%donkymagooterson> better than this
[4:55:20] <scottjefferson2punto0> that explains why re4 is your favorite
[4:55:22] <+SquishMittens7> This is a walking sim with jumpscares
[4:55:22] <+Dragon4234> It isn't
[4:55:22] <$zackalan> @patstaresat if you don't care for horror, then why do you stay with paige?
[4:55:22] <doughboidankweed> i literally just watched matt play this lol
[4:55:23] <pleasedontyelle> SOMA was sooooooo good
[4:55:23] <%Buzzard42> NO
[4:55:24] <Bigyanno> This is a puzzle horror
[4:55:24] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> WHO
[4:55:25] <animaspark> dont remember
[4:55:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I liked SOMA
[4:55:28] <olm46> SOMA's gameplay was pretty iffy to be fair.
[4:55:28] <%redthebaron> what a bad game this was like real bad
[4:55:29] <%JustYudha> People are stupid
[4:55:31] <Goodvibes99508> GO BACK TO BALDERS GATE
[4:55:32] <Wyrmsblood> Soma was existential horror
[4:55:32] <%ssjklyco> Soma had a better concept that most people don't think about.
[4:55:33] <guiltyboya> SOMA WAS A GREAT PHILOSOPHICAL GAME
[4:55:33] <+Kurt_0> What would you call this then
[4:55:34] <+olwe123> Way to leave use with blue balls
[4:55:34] <Visorak6> SOMA is ideologically scary
[4:55:37] <yourliteraldog> It was cool and scary
[4:55:38] <T_Sasquatch> I didn't play it so eh LUL i just watched the lp
[4:55:39] <Thirtine> SOMA was super scary, in an existential sense
[4:55:42] <hot_take_jake> soma was fucking terrifying in more ways than one
[4:55:43] <Kemmybelle> Stream SOMA or SH2.
[4:55:48] <+StoicMoogle> You just need a Suplex command
[4:55:49] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Its Machine for Pigs all over again
[4:55:51] <%Buzzard42> Soma was existential dread, the game
[4:55:52] <tolloponik> soma isn't really a horror game
[4:55:52] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> That playthrough with REDACTED
[4:55:53] <penitentpendant> It was intellectually horrifying
[4:55:53] <$Zalthia> I still think about Soma sometimes
[4:55:57] <+Ocaz> lets play soma!
[4:55:58] <%donkymagooterson> existential horror
[4:55:59] <%JustYudha> People think jumpscares and dark = good horror
[4:55:59] <%slimmixrp> Lets do SOMA again
[4:56:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oooh Silent Hill
[4:56:01] <penitentpendant> "Oh no, clones!"
[4:56:01] <TuxedoNash> soma wasn't a scary game, it just made you feel small
[4:56:03] <+dante_must_die_exe> Soma was pretty rad
[4:56:04] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat can you elaborate on why, and what elements of soma is better?
[4:56:05] <%Piemono> This game just doesn't feel that unique
[4:56:05] <wibbwobbler> i still bring up/think about that ending. blew my mind
[4:56:08] <+lazysaiyajin> 5min elaboration?
[4:56:08] <DianaTheAscian> is it worse though?
[4:56:10] <sausagesausage> machine for boring FeelsBadMan
[4:56:13] <tattleworm> amnesia was never good, it was just the happy wheels of horror games
[4:56:13] <hot_take_jake> did the machine for pigs team make this one?
[4:56:13] <Decarcassor> Oh no
[4:56:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> this is another example of trying too hard
[4:56:20] <+RowenCleric> SOMA had a horrifying ending
[4:56:21] <Decarcassor> The Chinese Roo: curse
[4:56:22] <%Buzzard42> Amnesia worked because the tension was all placebo effecgt
[4:56:22] <%captain_thickthighs> it seems like they're trying to pad stuff out
[4:56:23] <+Promessa_EX> Did pat every ddlc
[4:56:23] <%ssjklyco> "You can live for ever if you upload your concience and then kill yourself as fast as possible."
[4:56:26] <%donkymagooterson> I don't think it is quite as bad as machine for pigs but yeah
[4:56:26] <Bigyanno> This game could be SO COOL. I love the eldritch shit but god it's getting bogged down so damn much
[4:56:27] <KasiCrafter> There wasn't a whole lot of GAME in this game
[4:56:27] <RickSaintRiot> wrong, Amnesia was good
[4:56:28] <@commanderclaw> The lantern mechanic is bad and I'm sad that it still exists
[4:56:29] <Chatterbox1991> So Amnesia Yes, MFP No, Soma Yes, Rebirth No?
[4:56:30] <+HitchhikingThrough> That seems harsh, was getting kind of interesting
[4:56:31] <@SoFarFetched> I'll be honest,I never knew Amnesia had a story
[4:56:34] <sausagesausage> only lantern
[4:56:34] <+Dragon4234> Yep
[4:56:34] <DensityD> correct
[4:56:34] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Yes it's true
[4:56:35] <+Delanus_Turgias> @PatStaresAt when are you playing SH4
[4:56:36] <Rum_Ham1> true
[4:56:36] <trianglehat> yes
[4:56:37] <+J_Papa> idk it seems almost as good as Dark Descent but that came out a long time ago
[4:56:38] <%Buzzard42> Amnesia just had lamp oil
[4:56:38] <EternalJedi> yes
[4:56:40] <+dante_must_die_exe> Machine for Pigs was dog shit LUL
[4:56:41] <RickSaintRiot> it's a little better than Machine just because the inventory management
[4:56:41] <DensityD> you just applied matches to candles
[4:56:41] <penitentpendant> There was more of a mystery in the original Amnesia
[4:56:42] <guiltyboya> NOPE that's new indeed
[4:56:46] <%donkymagooterson> you did not have matches in the 1st one
[4:56:48] <EternalJedi> you only had inderboxes to light candles and such
[4:56:49] <+Link232> Amnesia 1 only had tinderboxes, not matches for lighting torches
[4:56:52] <+meikae> tinderbox
[4:56:52] <scrublord009> why are people saying Woolie collaborated with a racist?
[4:56:52] <scottjefferson2punto0> matches?
[4:56:53] <T_Sasquatch> Amnesia was never good rmzDEVIL rmzSLAIN rmzWOW rmzRAGE
[4:56:53] <%condemned_15> you had tinderboxes
[4:56:53] <Wyrmsblood> Lamp oil and tinderboxes
[4:56:54] <%Archphronimos> SOMA was true horror in that it wasn't just scary, it was disturbing on some other level
[4:56:58] <%Niney_Who> Only good thing about Machine for Pigs is the final speech
[4:56:59] <scottjefferson2punto0> dont you mean tinderboxes?
[4:57:10] <+dante_must_die_exe> Tinderboxes
[4:57:17] <RickSaintRiot> Descent was disturbing too
[4:57:21] <scrublord009> Also Amnesia sucks
[4:57:24] <DensityD> space it out
[4:57:28] <+Pyroclase> Limited numbers of abilities to light lamps was a brilliant decision
[4:57:31] <RickSaintRiot> i actually love the Pig design in Machine.
[4:57:32] <%Buzzard42> @PatStaresAt except that the sanity mechanic was ALL placebo effect
[4:57:34] <sausagesausage> steam rolling
[4:57:43] <DensityD> but it slows you down!
[4:58:03] <+StoicMoogle> So when in this game do you get the Red9?
[4:58:08] <TuxedoNash> yeah 11 is too heavy
[4:58:14] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt Those forced flashbacks with no control kills the momentum of the game too
[4:58:15] <sausagesausage> mind goblins LUL
[4:58:16] <%luftraumm1> there's a problem with the level design here
[4:58:18] <scottjefferson2punto0> yeah, in the other amnesia, light sources lasted so much longer, and there is a max capacity!?
[4:58:26] <+J_Papa> Would you game over if you stayed in the dark?
[4:58:28] <wibbwobbler> a really boring roller coaster. don't care for those kind of horror games
[4:58:30] <tolloponik> the insanity effect is also way faster in this game
[4:58:31] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Hardcore mode in Amnesia 1 limits how many tinderboxes you get and you still end up with way more than what this game gives you
[4:58:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> say it
[4:58:37] <%luftraumm1> Soma had so many cool ass things to see
[4:58:38] <Visorak6> I appreciate the ideas this game is toying with but the execution is terrible
[4:58:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> SAY IT PAT
[4:58:42] <HotMafia81> Who the fuck can only carry 10 matches on their person?
[4:58:44] <+HitchhikingThrough> SAY IT YOU COWARD
[4:58:45] <scrublord009> AMNESIA BAD
[4:58:46] <Schlongalong> @PatStaresAt but what about the caves :O
[4:58:52] <BoneofMalkav> Thanks for the KPOPcheer @luckysteak
[4:58:52] <%bevyrage> ah shit is pat done for the night?
[4:58:55] <%bendatron> this game is also severly lacking in a threat
[4:59:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> So Amnesia sucks
[4:59:05] <penitentpendant> It's weighed too heavily toward resource starvation, which is why the Otherworld section was so interesting, because it was removed
[4:59:06] <Guardiansaiyan> @bevyrage yes
[4:59:07] <RickSaintRiot> that's very RE4 of you Pat
[4:59:07] <+StoicMoogle> Are we no gonna talk about how you got vored by a cave?
[4:59:08] <KasiCrafter> In the first Amnesia game, each playable sequence ended on a major setpiece, but here it feels like every few feet.
[4:59:11] <+sewermonk> it always goes back to consumables goblins doesnt it
[4:59:15] <Wyrmsblood> The pacing is just awful
[4:59:17] <%bevyrage> dammit. overslept my nap
[4:59:18] <KaiserMario> Like how you finish RE2 with infinite bullets?
[4:59:19] <%slimmixrp> Not being able to see is lame and annoying
[4:59:20] <+Ocaz> what about Justine?
[4:59:22] <scottjefferson2punto0> oh god!
[4:59:24] <+Promessa_EX> Consumables... yes
[4:59:26] <+Link232> Standard enemy but with bladearm
[4:59:26] <DianaTheAscian> also this game just isn't scary at all
[4:59:27] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> the heavies
[4:59:28] <HotMafia81> Sackface demons
[4:59:29] <%Buzzard42> the ghouls with MASSIVE patrol patterns
[4:59:35] <+dante_must_die_exe> AND they had custom maps!
[4:59:36] <+Matto424> Yeah was there like anything that was a threat besides the mound of beans
[4:59:36] <RickSaintRiot> Brute Enemy as well, which is just slightly tougher Grunt
[4:59:37] <Bigyanno> Light mechanics are garbage in games. Just let me see things!
[4:59:37] <+Pyroclase> There were a few "outrun the death wall" sections
[4:59:38] <%slimmixrp> Just make it a horror puzzle game but let us fucking see
[4:59:39] <%Typhaeon> They think anyone will give a shit about the constant, tedious asides about mah bebeh
[4:59:44] <penitentpendant> There was so little actual horror sections
[4:59:44] <%donkymagooterson> was there anything comparable to the first game when it came out? I feel like that was why it seemed so good at the time.
[4:59:45] <wibbwobbler> pacing is important
[4:59:46] <+Nemesisnick33> what is this sub only vod sht SwiftRage
[4:59:48] <%ssjklyco> this one, the enemy is pregnancy
[4:59:48] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> the scenery also changed depending on how crazy the character was
[4:59:54] <%AnIcedCoffee> The Kaernk(water monster) is way more interesting than the Ghul in Rebirth
[4:59:54] <%luftraumm1> you should check it again
[4:59:56] <penitentpendant> Replace Rebirth with Amnesia 1?
[4:59:56] <%Agami23> man. remember penumbra?
[4:59:57] <%slimmixrp> Just let us see
[4:59:57] <%juxtest> And a big worm
[4:59:59] <%bassoontyphoon> Cheer500 I feel like this game took huge steps back in terms of the progress they made with SOMA. Limited light resources, and pointless jumpscares are not fun and this game is full of them
[5:00:01] <%bassoontyphoon> bassoontyphoon's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[5:00:02] <scottjefferson2punto0> The tension was just a lot better and the voice acting I enjoyed it a lot more
[5:00:04] <+Kurt_0> Yes
[5:00:04] <DianaTheAscian> 3?
[5:00:04] <Decarcassor> @PatStaresAt The first game made you scared of water early and then threw water area at you where they MAY have been monsters but you never knew.
[5:00:06] <%shiplord13> 3
[5:00:06] <DensityD> hey pat thanks for turning me on to Tim Rogers
[5:00:07] <%bendatron> like twice for 10 seconds
[5:00:07] <animaspark> since i came here? 2
[5:00:14] <RickSaintRiot> Limited resources is fun
[5:00:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Nemesisnick33 response to Twitch shenanigans.
[5:00:15] <DianaTheAscian> 2-3
[5:00:15] <%shiplord13> I think 3
[5:00:18] <%BushidoBush> Amnesia as a series is pretty lame.
[5:00:19] <animaspark> in 3 hours, twice
[5:00:22] <%luftraumm1> 2 actual situations
[5:00:24] <+Cinnerennic> ryckertJerklaugh
[5:00:24] <KasiCrafter> Might as well boot it up The Dark Descent
[5:00:24] <RickSaintRiot> or rather, it's anti-fun for the purpose of increasing other fun
[5:00:25] <+J_Papa> not including a chase sequence?
[5:00:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> @Nemesisnick33 Bots going around striking people's vods for random stuff
[5:00:31] <+OotsyMahDootsie> amnesia 1 is god tier
[5:00:31] <+Pyroclase> Amnesia 1 was really good at making you THINK there was an enemy when there wasn't, which is really important to what made that game spooky
[5:00:34] <%mield916> the chase doesnt count so 2
[5:00:34] <DianaTheAscian> so just 2 then
[5:00:37] <Bigyanno> The goo was a bigger threat than the ghoul
[5:00:37] <+Pyroclase> You could never be sure if you were safe or not
[5:00:37] <%condemned_15> there was hiding too
[5:00:40] <Visorak6> The jpeg jumpscares lowered this game 2 points alone for me @PatStaresAt
[5:00:41] <%donkymagooterson> they introduce another enemy or two later on that are better but yeah
[5:00:42] <Wyrmsblood> I'm tired of plane crash lone survivor beginnings
[5:00:43] <%Buzzard42> the OG Penumbra games were pretty decent too
[5:00:43] <animaspark> so game sucks?
[5:00:45] <KaiserMario> Amnesia 1 is still really good for what it is... It's a shame that it doesn't work so great for most things. Unless you're Kojima, then somehow you can make it work
[5:00:47] <penitentpendant> Disappointment Unlocked!
[5:00:48] <%luftraumm1> there was 1 where you could have sneaked past
[5:00:48] <%Buzzard42> but they gave you a weapon so it was less scary
[5:00:49] <scottjefferson2punto0> this is the smallest step foward from a machine for pigs but it doesn't have the story to hold up
[5:00:51] <Valask> oh no is Amnesia not good? zekePEPE
[5:00:57] <%Cozy90> i agree
[5:00:58] <HotMafia81> Even with the spooky dimension town segments?
[5:01:00] <%Agami23> this feels like an amnesia machine for pigs sequel in that its pretty shit and not good.
[5:01:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You yourself gave us a goodly show.
[5:01:02] <+baka_sugoi> OOF
[5:01:02] <guiltyboya> JPEG JUMPSCARES ARE LAAAAME
[5:01:06] <+VoxelFox51> @PatStaresAt There was a room in the begining of Amnesia that really scared me, it was the room with the ghostly dog barking and whining. LIKE I COULNT BE IN THAT ROOM IT WAS SO SCARY...this...is a wet fart
[5:01:06] <+J_Papa> a lot more forced cutscenes
[5:01:08] <%chiazam> What happened?
[5:01:09] <RickSaintRiot> She technically wasn't the lone survivor @Wyrmsblood
[5:01:10] <DoobieDancer> A machine for pigs 2 lmao
[5:01:10] <+dante_must_die_exe> all D R A M A and no S C A R E
[5:01:10] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> the game was really boring. you were still entertaining though.
[5:01:11] <%SaiyanShoto> You always do Pat psaUp
[5:01:13] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's maybe halfway through the game
[5:01:13] <%donkymagooterson> I really think this was intended to be more of a lore dump for TDD than anything else
[5:01:15] <sakeydo> It has such a neat tone too.
[5:01:16] <+RowenCleric> I mean AMnesia was great for the time.. but so many have done it better since then.. .SOMA... P.T. ... RE7 to some extent
[5:01:17] <Visorak6> It feels like the B team made this game?
[5:01:20] <%slimmixrp> The eldritch puzzle zone was cool then back to not being able to see fucking shit
[5:01:20] <%luftraumm1> these game mechanics gave what they could
[5:01:20] <%JustYudha> Pee pee poo poo game
[5:01:22] <%LordGeneric> I want to be interested in the story but it's so slow I get distracted
[5:01:24] <hot_take_jake> the 2020 version of an amnesia game
[5:01:25] <%bendatron> this game presents 0 threat and is pretty much just a walking simulator with a few puzzles
[5:01:27] <RickSaintRiot> the lore is really delicious
[5:01:29] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt So is Gensin back on the menu
[5:01:30] <+HitchhikingThrough> Fetus of God shit was great
[5:01:30] <Bigyanno> I knew it would be kinda mediocre when it blew its load with the otherworld so damn quickly
[5:01:34] <KasiCrafter> It feels like the design regressed from the older ones.
[5:01:35] <scottjefferson2punto0> man, that sucks... i was really expecting another dark descent but it just didn't hit the mark...
[5:01:37] <DianaTheAscian> that was cool
[5:01:39] <$KnivesEve> so next game might be a good game?
[5:01:41] <+Kurt_0> I though people said this was good
[5:01:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Feels like there were bits and pieces torn and stitched back together by different people.
[5:01:47] <barbodogman> The whole baby thing is slowing this game down too much
[5:01:53] <RickSaintRiot> the Dead Lovecraft World was lovely
[5:01:54] <$joylent_blue> but we got B E A N S
[5:01:55] <@commanderclaw> I feel like someone on the team *really* likes dark caves and hallways
[5:02:05] <penitentpendant> I liked that when the Fetus in the dream section had a growth spurt, the next time she woke up she was bigger
[5:02:09] <%donkymagooterson> some of the backgrounds and environment designs in this are top notch, but it wasn't enoght
[5:02:09] <%slimmixrp> Exactly. Just horror puzzle and let us see shit
[5:02:11] <Bigyanno> Creepy>Spooky
[5:02:27] <Wyrmsblood> Remember the guy in Soma who ripped his own eyes out? That was cool.
[5:02:30] <Decarcassor> That chase section near the end could have been a cutscene. its not like there was any meaningfull choice here.
[5:02:30] <+Nemesisnick33> yes being able to see the game makes the game better
[5:02:33] <HotMafia81> Interesting to note that the original Amnesia's "no fighting" mechanic was a response to the survival horror games of the time. Now that we;ve moved past those games, the lack of combat feels a bit dated
[5:02:33] <%chiazam> Oh was the game bad?
[5:02:33] <scottjefferson2punto0> i felt like they tried to do it like dark descent or soma but someone on the team said "but this is so much better!", but it wasn't...
[5:02:34] <wibbwobbler> soma was so creepy
[5:02:40] <scrublord009> Horror sucks confirmed
[5:02:41] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt I've finished the game. The story is REALLY good and all the Other World sections and references to 1 are really good. The rest of it is so slow paced and the new match system is more annoying than anything.
[5:02:45] <penitentpendant> Too much resource gameplay, not enough horror
[5:02:47] <+J_Papa> you give birth to a tin of beans
[5:02:56] <%BushidoBush> Survival horror is infinitely scarier than straight 'horror'
[5:02:57] <%realm_forge> Pat sounds like a disappointed dad lecturing the game
[5:03:00] <shevan123> aww man
[5:03:00] <KasiCrafter> The whole Eldrich Stopwatch is also kind of...really impressive but super underwhelming in how its used?
[5:03:00] <%luftraumm1> lack of combat has been DONE
[5:03:01] <$KnivesEve> horror genre was a mistake
[5:03:03] <%Axellogic> Big mushy and sweet beans
[5:03:04] <%slimmixrp> Just let us do alien puzzles and see
[5:03:05] <%YakumoYomi> Apparently, the story is backloaded heavily
[5:03:05] <+SquishMittens7> Imagine if this game actually had dread
[5:03:07] <%bendatron> like theres cool stuff here but its trying to be vague for mystery and you get puzzle pieces but to like 4 different puzzles with big gaps between
[5:03:07] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Nyctophobia is over done
[5:03:09] <$RealThiele> bad, or best ending?
[5:03:12] <DianaTheAscian> is it worth it though?
[5:03:15] <RickSaintRiot> @HotMafia81 they took it OUT of Penumbra, just bc they were sick of dealing with people either hating the combat, or exploiting it and making the game too-easy
[5:03:19] <%donkymagooterson> exactly
[5:03:27] <animaspark> 1/3 is great, 2/3 is beans
[5:03:30] <RickSaintRiot> 1/3rd is a good estimate, so far.
[5:03:34] <%Buzzard42> Penumbra's combat actively made the game worse
[5:03:35] <+VoxelFox51> @DianaTheAscian I would buy it till a sale
[5:03:36] <KaiserMario> The gameplay holds the story back, kinda thing?
[5:03:42] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt did you ever play Outlast 2? cus that shares a lot of similarities with Rebirth, including the Pregnancy mcguffin and the air transport crash in the intro
[5:03:44] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Pretty much yeah. It's like how A Machine for Pigs blows really fucking hard until that one last scene at the underground temple.
[5:03:45] <%Buzzard42> monsters weren't threatening when you could just beat them to death
[5:03:48] <Goodvibes99508> those jpg jumpscares tho
[5:03:48] <RickSaintRiot> I'm sure it's more like 1/2.
[5:03:54] <Bigyanno> So this is a game you would want to watch someone play rather than play yourself? Well Pat, you'd better take one for the team here cos I ain't playing this
[5:03:55] <DianaTheAscian> @VoxelFox51 i prob will
[5:03:55] <RickSaintRiot> i think the story's holding back the gameplay, tbh
[5:04:00] <%Buzzard42> Amnesia's greatest gift was taking away your ability to fight back
[5:04:09] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> so are you switching out Thursday with more Doom Eternal then?
[5:04:16] <$SuperSilverPanda> FF14
[5:04:17] <%Buzzard42> DooT
[5:04:17] <+lazysaiyajin> machine for pigs
[5:04:18] <DianaTheAscian> 14? PogChamp
[5:04:20] <%Ranryu692> hooray
[5:04:20] <%luftraumm1> jpg jumpscares were dumb as hell
[5:04:21] <%Agami23> theres the new spooky's jumpscare mansion dlc
[5:04:22] <@SoFarFetched> DbD's halloween event is happening soon Kappa
[5:04:24] <+StoicMoogle> You know what's fucked? You went through a war fort and found nothing to defend yourself with. wtf
[5:04:27] <penitentpendant> G'night Pat
[5:04:27] <+Pyroclase> Machine for Pigs is a shame because the idea has so much potential
[5:04:29] <TheHeroAppears> Wasteland 3 one day
[5:04:30] <Saltmeisterr> ScourgeBringer?
[5:04:30] <KaiserMario> How about you finish Blasphemous?
[5:04:32] <%JustYudha> Shouldve played doom lol
[5:04:32] <%luftraumm1> RoR2
[5:04:34] <Wyrmsblood> Hell yeah play Rogue
[5:04:34] <%za7az> Rogue legacy 2?
[5:04:38] <%AncelDeLambert> ORIGINAL BABY
[5:04:39] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Give a different horror game a shot?
[5:04:39] <+baka_sugoi> GGs
[5:04:39] <$RealThiele> waifu impact
[5:04:42] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> not going to finish this pat?
[5:04:42] <@SoFarFetched> no he means the OG Rogue game.
[5:04:43] <+Pyroclase> Industrial Revoltion as eldritch horror has so much potential
[5:04:44] <DianaTheAscian> do another ff14 dailys stream
[5:04:46] <ScreamLord> THE MO
[5:04:46] <RickSaintRiot> as opposed to all those Peace Forts
[5:04:47] <%donkymagooterson> great stream even though the game was sub-par
[5:04:47] <scottjefferson2punto0> man, im really dissapointed, i loved dark descent when I played it at junior high but this is just... not what I expected... we got the bad ending it seems.
[5:04:47] <%Ner234> Baby ...

[5:08:54] <theotrainwreck> AOC stream done was good patt
[5:08:59] <+Promessa_EX> No save is ironman
[5:09:10] <KaiserMario> I love how opinions are really nuanced, it's either shit, or it's great... Is it the games that have no in-between, or the gamers?
[5:09:13] <Valask> Chat are there any good horror games coming out this halloween season?
[5:09:14] <Thewoodentree> See you snow fuckers in Alabama, God be with you

[5:09:16] <Valask> I want the spooks
[5:09:22] <%donkymagooterson> it's OK
[5:09:24] <%coreyyotto> horror games need to take a break on the lovecraft stuff. there's just too much right now and i never thought I'd say that
[5:09:26] <%luftraumm1> damn aoc stream done??
[5:09:29] <Visorak6> There is a game in this game but its just not there atm?
[5:09:30] <RickSaintRiot> My game style determines my gamer style.
[5:09:45] <jorniev> man fuck 2020
[5:09:54] <T_Sasquatch> Insane in the membraneeee
[5:09:56] <Valask> Machine for Pigs is still the best title for anything
[5:10:02] <+Pyroclase> Justine was from the DLC was for Amnesia Dark Descent
[5:10:03] <%luftraumm1> lovecraft stuff is reaching saturation
[5:10:06] <RickSaintRiot> they're stuck on the superficial Mythos stuff and they're not taking the ESSENCE of Lovecraft
[5:10:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Most of the time, my game style is sneaky, stabby bitch, so....
[5:10:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> No, we need more Lovecraft games!
[5:10:17] <gamewarden92> Puppet Combo makes good scary games.
[5:10:19] <%Flamefish345> Disc Room is out Oct 22nd. Looks like a fun Rogue-Lite from Devolver if you would like to give that a try. Run through rooms full of big ass saw blades
[5:10:21] <%Samurai_Mak> Samurai_Mak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! What's going on brother. Haven't been able to watch you live but been loving the VODs. Always appreciate the hard work. Much love to you and your growing family.

[5:10:35] <+Nuclearcherries> I AM BACK BOOMER
[5:10:39] <RickSaintRiot> Puppet Combo is an avant garde genius, i hate them
[5:10:42] <%toolofparanoia> At least there's DOOM to look forward to
[5:10:46] <Valask> when can we get a Shadow Out of Time game you cowards
[5:10:46] <+Byronic_dreamer> @KaiserMario it's the gamers, too many people jump to extremes
[5:11:01] <Guardiansaiyan> @Nuclearcherries he is done stream
[5:11:02] <scottjefferson2punto0> dark descents sanity effects were SO GOOD, it really made you feel like you were insane.

[5:11:22] <CombatTeddy8> "hallucinate enemies" i can relate
[5:11:24] <RickSaintRiot> puppet combo has the jumpscare down to the most brutal, ugly perfection
[5:11:30] <%luftraumm1> sanity effects will never be as good as pargon pargon pargon
[5:11:37] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[5:11:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mac n cheese ears

[5:12:03] <Thirtine> vineAlien what a jaypeg
[5:12:04] <+Pyroclase> That is what I would expect from an asset flip unity horror game
[5:12:06] <Valask> that's like a one man indie game kinda thing what the hell
[5:12:06] <%luftraumm1> pargon pargon pargon
[5:12:07] <%captain_thickthighs> well people do sell theirselves for JPEGs so they are scary
[5:12:07] <RickSaintRiot> I've seen worse. But yeah, it's not great.
[5:12:07] <wibbwobbler> they practically invented it
[5:12:14] <%toolofparanoia> The ghost in DUSK was scarier
[5:12:15] <RickSaintRiot> also, it could be a PNG
[5:12:19] <Jackshot72> Hey Pat heard the game is shit but hope you're otherwise having a good day!
[5:12:23] <%Profmcstevie> Especially in "hold forward" sections where you just run away
[5:12:28] <$joylent_blue> i fuckin' love sg-1
[5:12:37] <RickSaintRiot> almost everything in DUSK is scarier
[5:12:37] <$RealThiele> IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACKSWING?!

[5:12:51] <Thirtine> aw yeah sg-1

[5:13:02] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[5:13:02] <%kekkerscrew> SG1 is so good
[5:13:04] <%Valdorick> That was the BEST
[5:13:04] <President_Pariah> just hopped in from AOC's stream, she had 400K concurrent at one point for her first stream. really puts in perspective the difference between internet famous and REAL famous
[5:13:07] <RickSaintRiot> the monster underwater was a good bit.
[5:13:15] <+Kindan55> damn that sucks.
[5:13:16] <%cvp5127> was atlantis good?
[5:13:18] <$RealThiele> that episode was amazing
[5:13:26] <%kekkerscrew> SG1 made the P90 So Great
[5:13:26] <%Valdorick> Atlantis bad

[5:13:44] <%luftraumm1> oh

[5:13:51] <metalsiren31> God I hate the Ori so much
[5:13:51] <+lazysaiyajin> nice
[5:13:51] <%Valdorick> Universe? More like... Universe killer.
[5:13:52] <Thirtine> yep
[5:13:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I liked Atlantis
[5:13:54] <KaiserMario> Is that the Kratos show?
[5:13:55] <%captain_thickthighs> praise be the ori
[5:13:55] <+Pyroclase> I just googled and it says Threads is a season 8 episode?
[5:13:55] <%Valdorick> Because it killed the universe.
[5:13:59] <%Broand> And then the aurai or whatever? the aurai kind of sucked to be honest
[5:14:03] <$joylent_blue> fuckin' sg-1 was SO GOOD
[5:14:04] <RickSaintRiot> Cleanly breaks, yeah
[5:14:07] <c13scarecrow> season 9 is when they bring in the shit new aliens, you're thinking season 1-8

[5:14:18] <%Dementedpenguin> They cancelled Atlantis so that Universe could be funded. That turned out great........
[5:14:20] <KaiserMario> ye
[5:14:21] <%kekkerscrew> 8 and 9 aren't bad. But it's basically a spinoff show
[5:14:24] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt is that when the ori pop in?
[5:14:31] <%Ranryu692> you always say sci-fi shows have 9 seasons
[5:14:31] <%luftraumm1> cool

[5:21:12] <$RealThiele> dont be a one trick pony
[5:21:42] <%Broand> DK's diversifying his porfolio
[5:21:48] <%AncelDeLambert> @lewd_sister_of_battle last like four major updates have been DOA
[5:21:48] <%realm_forge> Byf is the best
[5:21:51] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt they stopped the warframe program for content creators thats prob why they dont make as much warframe stuff
[5:22:03] <%Cozy90> hey anyone interested in Godfall? im curious if anyone else has any interest?
[5:22:05] <%Ner234> Can he do magic?
[5:22:05] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> @AncelDeLambert oof...
[5:22:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I used to have a pet turtle named Poseidon
[5:22:10] <%sausagesausage> D:
[5:22:13] <%realm_forge> Byf needs to record audiobooks with that voice
[5:22:13] <+fladdykin> fladdykin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[5:22:20] <$RealThiele> please have a tiny turtle beard
[5:22:21] <+gerunding> did you kiss him, or
[5:22:31] <CombatTeddy8> Hows Elmo?
[5:22:33] <%chiluzza> perfect
[5:22:45] <%AncelDeLambert> ... ow, damn
[5:22:47] <CombatTeddy8> praise be
[5:22:51] <Valask> that's not good
[5:22:52] <%AncelDeLambert> yes
[5:22:52] <+AMagicalFlute> Yes
[5:22:53] <%Agami23> yes
[5:22:54] <%CokeMilkRequiem> pigmen
[5:22:55] <%TheFabledAble> nope
[5:22:55] <barbodogman> ONCE
[5:22:56] <+Pyroclase> Yes
[5:22:58] <scottjefferson2punto0> yes! 2 times :-v
[5:22:59] <$RealThiele> OOF
[5:23:01] <+Pyroclase> In ONE section
[5:23:01] <+gerunding> "my own worst enemy"
[5:23:01] <Valask> you never die I think
[5:23:02] <KaiserMario> Yes
[5:23:02] <DianaTheAscian> i wanna say yes
[5:23:03] <%AncelDeLambert> in like three segments
[5:23:03] <RickSaintRiot> Yes, i think once or twice.
[5:23:04] <+gerunding> is my assumption
[5:23:07] <%DensityD> ONCE
[5:23:09] <+AMagicalFlute> Technically 2
[5:23:09] <scottjefferson2punto0> NO, 2 times!
[5:23:10] <RickSaintRiot> But much less than in Descent.
[5:23:14] <+Monolith_x> there is like 4 encounters
[5:23:17] <%Divryne> TWO OR THREE.
[5:23:18] <barbodogman> Machine for pigs is REALLY bad
[5:23:18] <+gerunding> you can him
[5:23:19] <%donkymagooterson> yeah like twice
[5:23:22] <%Broand> It's not survival horror if you can't die
[5:23:25] <%DensityD> it was 18 years ago
[5:23:25] <DianaTheAscian> 10
[5:23:25] <%realm_forge> The pigs are a metaphor for capitalism
[5:23:27] <+gerunding> @DensityD
[5:23:29] <KaiserMario> Less than 5
[5:23:29] <%AncelDeLambert> there's a hallway one runs down, and at least two other "arenas" where you have to dodge the pigs who're patrolling
[5:23:34] <+AMagicalFlute> Amnesia 1 not only had enemies that attacked you but it had DIFFERENT ENEMIES
[5:23:36] <%CokeMilkRequiem> yeahh
[5:23:41] <ergulor> Yeah
[5:23:42] <%luftraumm1> a LOT changed in 8 years
[5:23:43] <%BubbaRands> So in this horror game, the horror happens...twice...
[5:23:44] <scottjefferson2punto0> well, if you count the alley run and the water one, then yes. 4
[5:23:49] <%Agami23> theres also only one enemy type in machine for pigs
[5:23:49] <Valask> @Broand Call of Cthulhu from like 14 years ago though
[5:23:51] <scottjefferson2punto0> BUT you get to kill one of them!
[5:23:53] <KasiCrafter> They appeared somewhat drequently.
[5:23:53] <gamewarden92> Enemies do not fuck in any of those games
[5:23:53] <RickSaintRiot> There were at least 4.
[5:23:55] <%donkymagooterson> somehow amnesia 1 makes you feel like something is going to kill you even when you're perfectly safe
[5:23:55] <%DensityD> that's a good grouping of the percentiles
[5:23:57] <%Profmcstevie> They make you insane just LOOKING at them, you hide in Amnesia 1
[5:23:58] <jorniev> what happend with penumbra?
[5:24:00] <+gerunding> idk there's nothing scary about jump scares
[5:24:00] <Valask> you don't die, and it's terrifying
[5:24:04] <scottjefferson2punto0> yeah, the amnesia encounters are SO iconic
[5:24:05] <RickSaintRiot> and the Brutes 1-hit kill you.
[5:24:13] <+GuilKato> soma had multiple
[5:24:14] <$RealThiele> but man that crazy jpeg
[5:24:15] <+gerunding> don't die, don't get tickled
[5:24:17] <scottjefferson2punto0> the closet monster, the water one, the sewers brute, etc.
[5:24:21] <%DensityD> lets do SOMA again
[5:24:23] <%twistedj3ster> Soma was amazing
[5:24:23] <+gerunding> yeah you know what
[5:24:27] <+gerunding> soma does rule
[5:24:28] <%toolofparanoia> SOMA 2 when?
[5:24:29] <Xelhesia> WANNA PLAY SOMA AGAIN ON STREAM?
[5:24:31] <+gerunding> SOMA AGAIN
[5:24:32] <PaPaSeppuku> PLAY SOMA
[5:24:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @donkymagooterson It did that by straight lying to you "playing door opening/closing noises, walking noise" when nothing was around.
[5:24:34] <%Spydurman> play SOMA Thursday
[5:24:37] <%donkymagooterson> by far the best frictional game
[5:24:37] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt just replay SOMA for October
[5:24:38] <scottjefferson2punto0> YES
[5:24:39] <%Dementedpenguin> SOMA was 5 years ago and I still think about that game.
[5:24:41] <trianglehat> YES
[5:24:41] <CombatTeddy8> yes
[5:24:42] <%TheFabledAble> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[5:24:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes, please
[5:24:43] <%DensityD> PEACHES!!! <3 <3
[5:24:46] <RickSaintRiot> There are like 2-3 encounters in Descent with the Water Monster ALONE
[5:24:47] <scottjefferson2punto0> SOMA AND PAIGE!
[5:24:47] <%Dylveryn> Do it PLEASE
[5:24:47] <$SuperSilverPanda> what about that cyberpunk horror game? forgot whats its called
[5:24:47] <stardustcrusad3r> soma fucked me up its so great
[5:24:48] <%Spydurman> yes
[5:24:52] <%DensityD> it's a thinking person's game
[5:24:53] <%Agami23> oh yeah, is paige good enough to stream?
[5:24:54] <$RealThiele> the new until dawn game soon
[5:24:54] <CombatTeddy8> yes with peaches
[5:24:55] <%arancet> somas their best, but still dont think its that good, way too heavy handed with its message
[5:24:56] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Has Paige played Dark Descent?
[5:25:01] <%donkymagooterson> @CommanderSqueaks agreed
[5:25:04] <%Agami23> damn.
[5:25:08] <%DensityD> literally butthurt
[5:25:08] <%ssjklyco> I forgot she played it
[5:25:10] <+GuilKato> Pat get a eye tracker and paige can play soma with it
[5:25:16] <wibbwobbler> peachpeachpeach
[5:25:17] <%toolofparanoia> SIT HIM BETWEEN YOU TWO AND PLAY TOGETHER
[5:25:17] <jorniev> remember when you have to GO DOWN in the underwater base in soma?
[5:25:24] <T_Sasquatch> Currently LUL its been months now
[5:25:24] <jorniev> scary shit
[5:25:24] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Why did you ruin Paige's back?
[5:25:25] <RickSaintRiot> Descent's better than SOMA. Unsure how the Penumbras stack up, though.
[5:25:31] <scottjefferson2punto0> ruby weapon hour: amnesia the dark descent!
[5:25:31] <%sausagesausage> psaGoblin
[5:25:37] <%DensityD> ME TOO

[5:25:46] <%ssjklyco> Hopefully elmo rides him
[5:25:47] <%weissguard> psaWink
[5:25:48] <madogod> gief is already big and stupid
[5:25:49] <+solidmclovin> i just started rewatching the soma playthrough :o
[5:25:49] <@SoFarFetched> as he sits on elmo

[5:26:04] <%heartlesshealer> dead by love
[5:26:04] <@SoFarFetched> at least you won't say "FUCK ON ME"
[5:26:06] <%DensityD> When gief is big, will he talk with buttons?
[5:26:06] <+mostbrokenrobo> weird fetish pat
[5:26:10] <CombatTeddy8> DS?
[5:26:13] <%sausagesausage> psaWhat psaDogchamp
[5:26:14] <+nitestar428> probably same feeling Paige has bout you
[5:26:17] <%DensityD> excuse me, I mean "communicate"
[5:26:18] <RickSaintRiot> You can barely die in SOMA.
[5:26:18] <@SoFarFetched> big baby
[5:26:18] <%toolofparanoia> jesus
[5:26:19] <YourBuddyBodhi> Big Boi!
[5:26:20] <%AzureGale> Can't wait for Gief to lean how to green paw
[5:26:22] <%Arxel1> So more than you? LUL
[5:26:23] <+gerunding> i would assume the buscemi pillow would be ruined by then, with the fabric of his face draped over his
[5:26:23] <%toolofparanoia> Love that
[5:26:24] <%Ner234> psaBig
[5:26:24] <RickSaintRiot> I think ppl forget that fact.

[5:26:58] <%luftraumm1> u make a good point
[5:27:00] <%donkymagooterson> you make a strong argument sir
[5:27:01] <%DensityD> psaDogchamp
[5:27:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dog infinitely improve stream.
[5:27:02] <%rdark_ksu> Dog Champ
[5:27:04] <%Ranryu692> he'll grow out of needing that constant supervision eventually, anyway
[5:27:05] <15zelda1> bong
[5:27:05] <%AncelDeLambert> look at him, so regal, so majestic
[5:27:08] <+gerunding> he's trying to bring the mic closer
[5:27:09] <%DensityD> pretty eyes
[5:27:09] <CombatTeddy8> almighty elmo
[5:27:11] <barbodogman> I love elmo
[5:27:11] <%BubbaRands> It's like youre the Dr. Dolittle of gaming
[5:27:12] <%toolofparanoia> Cat... AND Dog!
[5:27:12] <Jack8274> My mom locked the dog up in a cage 24/7 and would only let it out to poop.
[5:27:15] <+gerunding> his paws atrophied
[5:27:16] <RickSaintRiot> Gief and Mo
[5:27:16] <YourBuddyBodhi> Stream Quality go up
[5:27:27] <%DensityD> cat-dog, if you will
[5:27:39] <%AncelDeLambert> you can do a LOT with 700 bucks
[5:27:46] <%ssjklyco> PCpartpicker helps with your budget
[5:27:50] <$RealThiele> wait for a year for BG3
[5:27:52] <%cvp5127> pcpartpicker
[5:27:52] <%DensityD> part picker
[5:28:00] <+gerunding> ***
[5:28:05] <%AncelDeLambert> 700 will get you a 1060 and an i5 without issue these days and be WAY below your budget
[5:28:07] <@SoFarFetched> yeah REALLY wait on it
[5:28:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat's plan to just throw as much money as possible to get biggest PC
[5:28:13] <CombatTeddy8> BG3 hype
[5:28:16] <@SoFarFetched> Dice rolls seem rigged
[5:28:17] <%DensityD> Friend of the podcast and stream, Plague of Gripes
[5:28:23] <wibbwobbler> its a really expensive demo
[5:28:24] <%toolofparanoia> Let Baulder's Gate stay in the oven a bit longer
[5:28:24] <RickSaintRiot> PC Power go up
[5:28:33] <15zelda1> what do you mean?
[5:28:37] <Jack8274> So you want a mind goblin mode?
[5:28:37] <RickSaintRiot> what does Plague think of his initials spelling POG
[5:28:39] <Jack8274> Is what your saying
[5:28:44] <%AncelDeLambert> a real tabletop game has the DM adjusting to keep the campaign interesting
[5:28:46] <CombatTeddy8> kick a small creature off a cliff!!!!!!
[5:28:48] <%heartlesshealer> unless DM was strict asshole
[5:28:48] <%Bonkasaurusrex> Instead you should play Pathfinder Kingmaker
[5:28:50] <%rdark_ksu> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat have you ever eaten pheasant? its in season here in kansas and is something me and gpa hunt every year
[5:28:54] <+GuilKato> when all 4 of you fail a perception roll
[5:28:59] <%DensityD> the game forces you to be honest. be honest with yourself and people HATE IT. LUL
[5:29:00] <Valask> Pat endorses dice fudging WutFace
[5:29:04] <Jack8274> So xcom?
[5:29:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> X-Com?
[5:29:06] <+gerunding> 88% is literally the fft percentage rate
[5:29:06] <$RealThiele> hero points
[5:29:07] <%cvp5127> so xcom
[5:29:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> X-Com 2?
[5:29:08] <gamewarden92> X-Com?
[5:29:09] <%heartlesshealer> Oh yeah, Kingmaker's a thing
[5:29:09] <15zelda1> aight pat just doesnt play xcom
[5:29:09] <%YakumoYomi> Classic D&D DM behavior: fudge the rolls in favor of "fun"
[5:29:10] <madogod> xcom?
[5:29:10] <%Agami23> i watched some D&D tonight that had the meanest things in it
[5:29:11] <%DensityD> numbers are numbers
[5:29:12] <%Xevtes> xcom
[5:29:13] <%redthebaron> wow
[5:29:14] <$KnivesEve> xcom
[5:29:16] <madogod> no xcom is way more
[5:29:16] <%redthebaron> that is a lot
[5:29:17] <%heartlesshealer> WOW
[5:29:19] <RickSaintRiot> I'd like a little piece of fudge that looked like a die.
[5:29:20] <+Kindan55> never played Morrowind?
[5:29:20] <%Jekado> one time he missed like 4 or 5 times in a row at like 80% plus on hit chance
[5:29:21] <CombatTeddy8> oh no
[5:29:21] <+shabop> true
[5:29:22] <+SpectrumSpy> Dice fudging for combat?
[5:29:25] <%ssjklyco> Xcom was 99 % and you still missed
[5:29:26] <madogod> you can miss 95%
[5:29:27] <gamewarden92> how?
[5:29:31] <T_Sasquatch> Yikes
[5:29:33] <RickSaintRiot> Sounds like the percentages were honest, lol
[5:29:33] <PAPA_BUNGO> early game xcom will always be the worst
[5:29:37] <%Valdorick> X-COM LEGIT fudged numbers
[5:29:41] <+gerunding> sounds like you suck lol
[5:29:49] <%twistedj3ster> I do that in Pokemon a lot
[5:29:50] <Neo_Kaiser> I'd never fudge. You would die Pat!
[5:29:51] <Visorak6> XCOM fudges the numbers behind the scenes for drama @PatStaresAt
[5:30:01] <%Sasha_conyst> Possible but not probable.
[5:30:04] <%Jekado> as a DM you kinda have to handwave some bad rolls
[5:30:05] <%heartlesshealer> Xcom had point blank shotgun be less than 70% accuracy, right?
[5:30:05] <15zelda1> xcom fudges its number only on lower difficulties
[5:30:06] <+Link232> Only on easier difficulties if I recall right
[5:30:07] <Valask> oh you want it to lie like XCOM and Fire Emblem?
[5:30:07] <%Ynkubus_> A physics based dice roller might've been something to try out along with DMs/game fiat.
[5:30:08] <+Pyroclase> Confirmation bias is great, isn't it?
[5:30:09] <wibbwobbler> i don't get it
[5:30:10] <%redthebaron> percentage are bad for our brain
[5:30:10] <RickSaintRiot> feelsbadman
[5:30:10] <%DensityD> Which regular polyhedron do you want @RickSaintRiot ? D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20?
[5:30:13] <%luftraumm1> good dms know when to fudge
[5:30:13] <$RealThiele> so they need to have players roll physics dice
[5:30:15] <%donkymagooterson> any gambler will tell you that true probability is bullshit
[5:30:18] <+Kindan55> probably needs a detailed difficulty tuner
[5:30:30] <%arancet> drag plague onto a stream again, or ds9
[5:30:32] <%Kharinite> Kharinite subscribed with Prime. 
[5:30:33] <%DensityD> THE BABY
[5:30:34] <%Jekado> i've fucking instant crit'd someone for max damage in dnd and i was like well this was the very first combat lets ignor this
[5:30:36] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Genshin impact. After watching you and Jim Sterling play, I have decided to play. What was the best way for you to spend money? I intend to give them up to $60 usd as that's what it would cost if I had bought the game
[5:30:36] <%AncelDeLambert> DAMN
[5:30:38] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt I played over 60 hours of Baldurs Gate 3 and grew to hate 88% chance to hit more than anything, because it felt like it was never reliable ever
[5:30:38] <%optimasmaximas> LUL

[5:30:58] <%AncelDeLambert> her excuse is that she was written by a mysogynist Japanese man
[5:30:58] <+solidmclovin> why cant i rewatch the stream :"( do i have to wait until stream ends

[5:31:06] <%weissguard> Gotta kill Metroids, followed by protecting one that protected her.
[5:31:07] <%Valdorick> The real reason X-COMs fudging is bad, is because it DOES have bad fudging, and playing optimally and getting constant 95%s and missing MORE than 5% of the time is just... the worst.
[5:31:09] <+GuilKato> Her FAMILY Family Family Family
[5:31:11] <PAPA_BUNGO> THE BABY
[5:31:11] <$RealThiele> AUTHORIZE MY UTERUS ADAM
[5:31:15] <+gerunding> didn't watch the bb lp because i didn't want spoilers, but
[5:31:16] <+Pyroclase> The demo isn't part of the final game by the way
[5:31:19] <+Pyroclase> it's its own level
[5:31:19] <%Valdorick> Meanwhile, what does it fudge in your favor? You get missed at sometimes?
[5:31:20] <%arancet> @Bluwizard21 battlepass and log in bonus are only semi decent deals
[5:31:24] <%Dementedpenguin> 2010: Other M BABY 2020: Amnesia BABY
[5:31:24] <%kekkerscrew> Had a major gaming session, it was the final battle of the campaign on a hot summer day in back of a gaming room with no air conditioning. And there were more nat 1s than I have ever seen in my life on DM and players
[5:31:25] <%Bluwizard21> @gerunding no you dont get items that unlock doors
[5:31:27] <%weissguard> Wait, ignore me, I stumbo.
[5:31:28] <KaiserMario> The Plague simulator
[5:31:28] <RickSaintRiot> Can you imagine an RPG system that lies, but in the WRONG direction?? that would be hilarious
[5:31:28] <%Kharinite> Love you Pat
[5:31:33] <+solidmclovin> yes
[5:31:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think so, yes.
[5:31:38] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat you need to look at darkwood again
[5:31:39] <%TheFabledAble> insanity went up
[5:31:39] <Neo_Kaiser> One dev programmed their game so that 90% was always 100%.
[5:31:41] <Xelhesia> YUP
[5:31:41] <CombatTeddy8> yes
[5:31:43] <+solidmclovin> no damage or anything just distortion
[5:31:44] <%heartlesshealer> I think it was that the enemy looked at you
[5:31:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> It did it in Amnesia, too.
[5:31:46] <%rdark_ksu> yea made it staticy
[5:31:52] <%donkymagooterson> I think they were limited by trying to follow up on a dated game instead of coming up with something new
[5:31:53] <+GuilKato> distrorted vision and it would encourage them to attack
[5:32:02] <$RealThiele> static then failure state
[5:32:04] <%Bluwizard21> @arancet whats the battle pass? the welkin moon thing?
[5:32:06] <RickSaintRiot> There's one that finds you when you look at it, but looking doesn't damage.
[5:32:07] <+solidmclovin> i dont even think insanity in soma had any real gameplay effects besides screen distortion and making them attack you with certain enemies?
[5:32:11] <+gerunding> that's the only literal enemy i could recall
[5:32:12] <+GuilKato> yeah the dude on the sunken ship would attack if you looked at him
[5:32:14] <Jack8274> When you look at patriarchy you take damage
[5:32:14] <%heartlesshealer> It made enemy ai more aggressive
