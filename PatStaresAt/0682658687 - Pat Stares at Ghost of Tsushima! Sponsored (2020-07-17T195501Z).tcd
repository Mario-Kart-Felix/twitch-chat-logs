[1:07:04] <Brofarian> This guy's not blind, he just gave up his attachment to paying attention

[1:11:31] <%C0baltCrusade> @luckysteak not really arkham combat because it seems to HARD press you into 1 on 1 fighting, going in on a group seems to consistently kill you. It's a lot like AC Odyssey combat, cus of the mix of fighting and stealth and whatnot

[1:22:22] <%joylent_blue> the people that would complain are the people not in chat, geniuses
[1:22:30] <zenith0111> Pat is doing things out of fear of people not liking it .... like a coward :)
[1:22:31] <Hyphixsys> @doc_ock_rokc Kappa
[1:22:32] <Arisato_II> Pat, give us another Haiku
[1:22:33] <%Metballs> Of course Woolie's doing JP
[1:22:37] <%moogleboy1984> Pony Play?

[1:23:14] <%skizzuto> gotta save Uncle Kairi from the Mongols
[1:23:14] <ChoculaUltra> to be fair Woolie had a vote. There was much bloodshed but the survivors decreed JP voice acting.
[1:23:19] <Ner234> The wind is pushing meeeeeee
[1:23:19] <%PettyFunk> I'm kinda surprised Woolie is doing JP, I would think he'd prefer the voices that match the animation since the JP version is technically a dub.
[1:23:21] <$Heelypeely> "I sat on the pin. It did not give me a grin. Buy some marmalade" -Japan everyone
[1:23:22] <TioXyco> only sad thing about GoT is that the lip sync isn't dynamic, so it will keep the sync to english

[1:36:09] <%C0baltCrusade> game is really hardline on realism as of now but what's everyones over/under on there being at least one yokai in the game?

[1:41:13] <%VioletHeart> @JohnAtDawn It was fairly traditional for noblewomen to learn how to fight with a naginata.

[1:54:39] <Gruhunchously> He knows what's his
[1:54:39] <%zetastriker> So I just showed up, how is the open world part of the game? Is it like Breath of the Wild, or Ubisoft?

[1:55:40] <%ActionWords> personally I wanna try out that coffee that's been eaten by those civets, pooped out, and then brewed again
[1:55:41] <%BinaryFireball> this is the biggest problem with stealth or action games
[1:55:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> STELTH

[1:58:07] <SolsticeZro> victory pose
[1:58:20] <zenith0111> I honestly thought Jin would at least get a spear
[1:58:22] <SolsticeZro> @zenith0111 that blows
[1:58:28] <+Loinclothiclese> @stabbityrabbit what you dont want some elephant shit coffee?
[1:58:33] <haitakaa> what about that sake they make by chewing up rice then spitting it back out into a bottle
[1:58:34] <%toastybites> @SolsticeZro no Musashi in this game apparently
[1:58:45] <+pittbulldogg> as much sucky as i like?
[1:58:51] <olaksi> I don't understand how this fucking weeb game played a quest about stealing booze this humorlessly
[1:58:52] <OvaltineDream> Musashi is like 400 years after this
[1:58:57] <stabbityrabbit> Hook me up with horse milk, not e-coli.
[1:58:59] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Will Pat skip the stuff at the cart??? Probably.

[1:59:28] <SolsticeZro> cat comes with free cushion
[1:59:31] <%Mrbaconator> no cuz i would be a bad pet owner and that would be unfair to the animal
[1:59:34] <OriginalLurker> Parrots are the best pet
[1:59:35] <stardustcrusad3r> a russian blue stray wormed herself into my room and she wont leave me alone
[1:59:36] <ChoculaUltra> just get loaded off sake and tell bad haikus to strangers for the rest of time
[1:59:38] <AFlyingTaco1> Only reason I'm still around is because I have a stinky baby pup to take care of
[1:59:40] <haitakaa> by musashi he meant dual wielding

[2:00:40] <%zamzoph> @PatStaresAt like you used to?
[2:00:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> yeah
[2:00:40] <%C0baltCrusade> this is a nerd answer, i know, but it kind of makes sense that you wouldnt be able to duel wield cus this game is about 300-350 years before musashi was born
[2:00:41] <%DianaTheAscian> woolie?
[2:00:42] <Gruhunchously> 'Friend'? What is that?
[2:00:42] <%ActionWords> god these ginko trees are so SO VIBRANT

[2:01:03] <+worldbrand> in fairness it was because i was afraid of dogs
[2:01:04] <Saltmeisterr> wait woolie hates animals?
[2:01:04] <Profmcstevie> Some peoples reaction to animals, be them wild or even their own, are very indifferent. Wild shit
[2:01:06] <+Zagreus> I'm assuming DSP has been talked about?
[2:01:08] <ChoculaUltra> I knew a guy like that in grade school - he was on the news a few years ago for being a sex offender at a public pool. My friends and I still laugh about it.
[2:01:09] <Daxalog> There is tamed monster in the house and your apathetic!?
[2:01:13] <Gruhunchously> "They're just chemicals, come on"
[2:01:15] <%count_bob> Change the color!
[2:01:24] <%ToneBacas> animals are the best people. if you don't like animals, you lack emotions, and David Cage will hunt you down
[2:01:27] <jon651> kitten?
[2:01:36] <@SoFarFetched> well there's nothing much to talk with DSP except he's banned but he doesn't know why.
[2:01:43] <%ActionWords> so question about the game - how much of japan is now mongol occupied? valeThink and is this supposed to be like accurate to the time or a bit different?
[2:01:50] <zenith0111> @choculaultra Haha children were scarred :)
[2:01:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> kit10
[2:01:51] <Gruhunchously> David Cage will hunt you down and you will star in one of his games
[2:01:52] <%toastybites> @C0baltCrusade you'd think they'd at least try it at some point
[2:01:54] <@SoFarFetched> another Dr. Disrespect Kappa
[2:01:56] <ToneBacas> @SoFarFetched maybe the fap?
[2:01:58] <%ActionWords> because I thought the mongols didn't make it too far rooThink
[2:02:02] <%DianaTheAscian> oh wait i had friend who were stupid and thought turtles where invincible u can prob guess the rest @PatStaresAt
[2:02:11] <%C0baltCrusade> @ActionWords just the island of tsushima, the conflict is is that if the mongols take tsushima than the main island is done for
[2:02:16] <%clockworknate> I kinda wish that Cdprojekt red made this instead
[2:02:17] <+Zagreus> @SoFarFetched ah cool, was just wondering if pat mentioned it because he's who I learend about DSP from
[2:02:18] <SolsticeZro> Dyes Pog
[2:02:24] <ChoculaUltra> @zenith0111 to be fair, its never jovial laughter but more of that oh yikes laughter.
[2:02:26] <Profmcstevie> Ron and his superior, Iron
[2:02:29] <%Livelinne> psaGib woolieTRASH
[2:02:30] <zenith0111> @actionwords Mongols were the most dangerous warriors of the time. Conquering almost all of the old world.
[2:02:32] <%ActionWords> but how long have they been there?
[2:02:35] <Gruhunchously> I thought the Mongols never made it to Japan. Their fleet was caught in a storm or something
[2:02:37] <+sixcubit> everything about this game except the combat feels VERY dragon age
[2:02:37] <+james_cest_drole> That spoon though
[2:02:44] <Gamer76255> Armor is purely cosmetic, right?
[2:02:49] <@SoFarFetched> @Zagreus oh yeah he hasn't talked about it yet,either he will see chat talk about it or he sees that sub message someone did mentioning it.
[2:02:51] <%ActionWords> I thought that their invasion was repelled off the island from the first landings and second landings
[2:02:53] <olaksi> Island nations' defensive boost op, please nerf in next simulation
[2:02:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> mongols barely made it into Japan
[2:03:00] <%ActionWords> @Gruhunchously exactly
[2:03:01] <zenith0111> @choculaultra Humor and fear share the same spot in your brain :)
[2:03:19] <ChoculaUltra> that makes so much sense now monkaS
[2:03:21] <CappuccinoGuil> I like how Xenoblade does it: armor affects stats, but you can glamor it to have Naked Dunban KappaPride
[2:03:25] <%ActionWords> @olaksi better make a forum post about it
[2:03:37] <%ActionWords> maybe the devs will notice
[2:03:40] <xxmagonx> YEYEYEYE

[2:05:33] <%C0baltCrusade> YEYEYE
[2:05:44] <ChoculaUltra> DSP slew bankruptcy but fell to Twitch staff. Truly, a tragedy of the ages.
[2:05:44] <Zombrocom> Lets sit here and lisit to this story in the pouring rain
[2:05:48] <xtremegamer80> @Zagreus Something bad happened to DSP?
[2:05:49] <%toastybites> @ActionWords Noah was just a server migration
[2:05:49] <olaksi> @toastybites "Git gud scrub" -God
[2:06:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> why didn't you just watch this in the sub?
[2:06:07] <+Zagreus> @xtremegamer80 Somehow, DSP was banned

[2:08:31] <stabbityrabbit> @olaksi That seems to vary from person to person. I personally think the game is very boring, including the plot, with a couple stand-out characters.
[2:08:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> tomb raider crossover?
[2:08:49] <SolsticeZro> open tomb monkaW
[2:08:51] <Zombrocom> Wasn't Dr.d going to sue twitch or something? Or was that fake

[2:09:29] <hat_under_bread> That's such a good bit of flavor art.
[2:09:29] <%ActionWords> "wait what's a museum" Jin, probably
[2:09:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Is this the point where we do something that causes mass death and estruction?

[2:22:22] <%Mrbaconator> but pat what if we took your face......off
[2:22:24] <%TalisKanju> Elmo will fight, but not attack pests
[2:22:27] <heartlesshealer> Elmo could defeat Elmo. What are you talking about?
[2:22:31] <+xeros720> elmo fights for what he believes in
[2:22:32] <%ergulor> the skinless orb

[2:32:31] <Sternieliscious> Talk about a funky monk, eh?
[2:32:31] <%PulverKong> i just keep hearing Sushi Mom now
[2:32:32] <+worldbrand> jim tsushima is haunted by confetti
[2:32:32] <olaksi> Maybe the real bow was the journey itself
[2:32:33] <%Fien111> "STOP THIS" "why?" "I HAVE SPOKEN" "What?"
[2:32:33] <%AzureGale> Pretty sure that was a dude
[2:32:34] <%bhp_99> shoot him when he show up again

[2:32:44] <OvaltineDream> It killed an demon
[2:32:46] <%ToneBacas> it's the cursed Big Bo
[2:32:48] <%jjolion> What's with the blueberry blossoms?

[2:33:15] <%Dakuu75> The island was the ghost the whole time~
[2:33:19] <%bhp_99> release the darkness from the bow's heart
[2:33:20] <hat_under_bread> @PulverKong The real ghost is all the friends we made along the way.
[2:33:21] <+Skelegroove> They should sell prints of those paintings
[2:33:23] <%StaceMcGate> What if the Bow is the friendships we made along the way?
[2:33:28] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig cursed
[2:33:34] <zenith0111> Ghost of Last Nights Sushi has been good so far. Not amazing but good
[2:33:35] <%Faustgesicht> That's an awesome way to do a map. Love those prints
[2:33:35] <TheFramedWarlock> What do you think of the game so far ?
[2:33:36] <%ToneBacas> and the coastline. seems easy enough
[2:33:49] <%Fien111> Elder Scrolls Online has this exact same style of treasure hunting quest....except shittier cause that game sucks

[2:38:38] <%C0baltCrusade> BAD END
[2:38:39] <zenith0111> NOT THE BIRDS D:
[2:38:42] <%ToneBacas> hope the bow is worth it
[2:38:45] <venomfury86> and then Jin became BIRDMAN!!!
[2:38:54] <%Midashu> better than a bee typhoon
[2:38:59] <zeif00> Nice curse bro
[2:39:00] <hkgamingtv> longdong
[2:39:05] <TankMunky> need to find the haunted coat hanger to fight the birds
[2:39:07] <%count_bob> Oooh. It's not a stealth bow.
[2:39:07] <+Javaa01> @LateShowDave Oh this was paid for by Sony entirely, so considering that, this is gonna be a platform exclusive for a long while
[2:39:15] <%ToneBacas> sounds about right
[2:39:18] <Strider222> no its a bow
[2:39:20] <%SGrim> Yes
[2:39:26] <olaksi> Does it have a zoom scope?
[2:39:28] <%YakumoYomi> Jimbo Samurai, digivolve to...KARASUMON!
[2:39:41] <%ToneBacas> we can now snipe the end boss from this spot right now
[2:39:41] <%AzureGale> Fucking sniper rifles are the best kind of sniper rifles
[2:39:43] <SpaceGuntank> snipe some fools
[2:39:45] <TankMunky> a hitscan bow sounds broken.
[2:39:57] <graemecrackers2> i should of got this and not tlou2 months ago :/
[2:40:10] <Shyakuuu> That kurosawa esque vertical font still makes me Kreygasm
[2:40:19] <%etnoika> lmao yeah you shoulve
[2:40:26] <%WhereIsWill> that bow is huge
[2:40:30] <olaksi> Did I just see camo pattern?
[2:40:43] <SomeAsianDood> well it's called a longbow for a reason will
[2:40:44] <graemecrackers2> im moving out and moneys getting tight
[2:40:45] <SolsticeZro> Yasuo?
[2:40:46] <OvaltineDream> nliCry
[2:40:52] <disflipmat> Is Jin's voice actor the guy who did Wolf in Sekiro?
[2:40:56] <%za7az> @graemecrackers2 to be fair, there were a million red flags for tlou2 before it came out
[2:40:59] <ZE_Count> long bow is long
[2:41:02] <graemecrackers2> like pats dick
[2:41:02] <%NoahilDuce> and it shoot long
[2:41:03] <+TheBitingIrish> A Daikyu
[2:41:16] <%AzureGale> Why is it called a longbow and not a fuckinggiganticbow
[2:41:19] <+TheBitingIrish> Because, yes, it IS gigantic
[2:41:26] <%Fien111> Japanese Longbows are super cool, actually. They're assymetric so he can use them from horseback without it getting in the way
[2:41:31] <zenith0111> Should've been a compound bow
[2:41:35] <graemecrackers2> @za7az i didnt look at any of the spoilers
[2:41:44] <olaksi> Come play my lord
[2:41:47] <venomfury86> BIG BOW
[2:41:59] <%Fien111> So you get all the power and benefit of a proper longbow but on a horse like a boss
[2:42:08] <TankMunky> Pat's everlong race to make his virtual dolls pretty
[2:42:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> this is set 500 years ago. there were no compund bows
[2:42:20] <%jjolion> Need dough for the bow
[2:42:33] <%indig0bird> I wish the animation was like the real way of pulling the string
[2:42:37] <OvaltineDream> The mongols have them
[2:42:39] <%za7az> @graemecrackers2 I normally wouldn't have either, but when the universal reaction was negative, I knew something was wrong
[2:42:39] <tattleworm> play now, my lord
[2:42:40] <%Fien111> THis is set like 750 years ago
[2:42:40] <+TheBitingIrish> Try almost 800 @rumtumtugnutz
[2:42:42] <ZE_Count> its like 800 years ago
[2:42:43] <SomeAsianDood> I thought mongols were making compound bows at this point
[2:42:43] <olaksi> Shoot a peasant, samurai is allowed to do that in this time period
[2:42:48] <ammobasket> of course it sucks, it's cursed!
[2:42:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Eye-ron

[2:42:57] <%WhereIsWill> time for WIND
[2:42:58] <%C0baltCrusade> @PatStaresAt its blowing my mind that youve been doing so many quests and side activities and you've barely revealed the top THIRD of the map
[2:43:06] <%Dakuu75> are all thsoe ppl just homeless refugees?
[2:43:12] <SomeAsianDood> You're right composite @TheBitingIrish

[2:43:50] <%WhereIsWill> this a psaBig ass game
[2:43:52] <SolsticeZro> so we have one japan and then we attached another japan to it
[2:43:52] <stabbityrabbit> Phrasing.
[2:43:54] <%ToneBacas> hope you don't get burnt out from doing all the side shit
[2:43:55] <Cleric4gg> Game is huuuuge

[2:44:15] <%DianaTheAscian> whats your playtime?
[2:44:18] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> havent been there in such a long time
[2:44:18] <%NoahilDuce> ive heard its like 40-50 hours if you do everything, so thats pretty nice
[2:44:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, is there something we need to tell Paige???
[2:44:20] <Gruhunchously> Pat is the pull-out king
[2:44:20] <olaksi> Seems like a pain in the ass
[2:44:21] <%psidefx> they both have different feels
[2:44:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sometimes they don't clean the butt good and then you have problems.
[2:44:22] <TankMunky> What about not pulling out, but still going "ah shit"?
[2:44:24] <+TheBitingIrish> Not all of u- I MEAN
[2:44:25] <%Maids4lyfe> it might be Fien
[2:44:26] <zenith0111> I WAS TOO SLOW Kreygasm
[2:44:31] <+nirvana227> MiniK
[2:44:32] <+Javaa01> Yeah, this is very much the Witcher 3 thing of "Oh wow White Orchard is pretty big, oh by the way here's Velen, go nuts"
[2:44:35] <%etnoika> !uptime
[2:44:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 44m.
[2:44:42] <zenith0111> I'LL BE RESPONSIBLE Kreygasm
[2:44:45] <%Maids4lyfe> my dad was too slow psaDab
[2:44:48] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Fuck, that's cool
[2:44:54] <CursedNobleman> LUL archer shot someone in the ass
[2:45:00] <HipHopAnonymous23> This seems cool, but how does it stand out from every open world game?
[2:45:10] <%WhereIsWill> these upgrades make ya feel super badass
[2:45:10] <%StaceMcGate> can you increase the difficulty at any time?
[2:45:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @maids4lyfe Congratulations on existing!
[2:45:16] <bluebiscuit94> I like this open world because it's not big for the sake of being big, like it's often for the genre
[2:45:18] <%Maids4lyfe> it's not a fantasy world
[2:45:21] <+TheBitingIrish> Seems like it
[2:45:29] <ShichiNoBushi> Funky flo
[2:45:30] <%Maids4lyfe> @GeneralSCPatton thank you! LUL
[2:45:34] <LenDawsonsFresca> How slow are those arrows moving that he can just bat them away?
[2:45:57] <zenith0111> @hiphopanonymous23 Like a toned down Assassins Creed Odyssey. Someone else said it but it's pretty much accurate
[2:45:57] <Zasirel> just came in to see pat take out 5 guys like a goddamn boss
[2:45:57] <%ToneBacas> take a hint, Ubisoft
[2:45:57] <%Maids4lyfe> nah he's just fast
[2:46:04] <Saltmeisterr> like botw
[2:46:08] <%Maids4lyfe> ^^^^^^^^^
[2:46:08] <SolsticeZro> dont tell me how to do my job
[2:46:10] <+TheBitingIrish> Ey yo, dem dudes stole our shit
[2:46:11] <Ner234> Ghosts ... monkaS
[2:46:14] <TankMunky> If only we approached real life in the same way.
[2:46:16] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> Incredible flow pat!
[2:46:16] <TomFrancis_> @PatStaresAt how do you like the combat compared to sekiro?
[2:46:20] <bluebiscuit94> Oh yea the most recent ACs are a smorgasboard of icons, it's terrible
[2:46:23] <yficaptions> Witcher has some stuff like that as well
[2:46:23] <%HRDSalami654> So it's just samurai Witcher.
[2:46:24] <%Fien111> To pull out or not to pull out.....that is the question. Whether tis nobler in the dong to suffer the slings and arrows of accidental facial or to take up behind the sea of troubles and by finishing impregnate them
[2:46:25] <%toastybites> its probably a bear or something
[2:46:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "into the woods" you say Kappa
[2:46:29] <SpaceGuntank> oh no its the...GHOSTS of Tsushima!!
[2:46:38] <olaksi> IDK just seems like the same thing, it just doesn't dump everything on the map
[2:46:43] <ammobasket> it me, the blade demon
[2:46:48] <%zamzoph> unlike those fake batman games
[2:46:54] <$Afterman_> its a realized samurai game
[2:46:54] <+TheBitingIrish> I wonder if this is gonna have a few super fucked up side quests, a la RDR
[2:46:55] <+xeros720> i thought it was the one ghost
[2:46:57] <AFlyingTaco1> They're not even comparable, are they? This and Sekiro, I mean
[2:46:58] <ChoculaUltra> Spider-Man PS4 kinda spoiled me, haven't played an open world game since tbh.
[2:47:01] <+RobinFoDays> so whats the story so far
[2:47:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> It seems like this game will never fuck you over with ghost bosses
[2:47:03] <%SwdVengeance> Whoever said Arkham of Mordor hit it dead on
[2:47:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> lego batman?
[2:47:06] <TheFramedWarlock> Batman combat sucks though
[2:47:09] <%indig0bird> So, serviceable yet fun?
[2:47:09] <venomfury86> like Origins Kappa
[2:47:10] <agustorm123> The spiderman combat was so fun
[2:47:11] <%AzureGale> Yeah, Dark Tomorrow was peak Batman game
[2:47:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Asylum, City and knight?
[2:47:12] <Shwepie> They're completely different types of games. Comparing them is a bit futile.
[2:47:13] <+Ocaz> tales from the baterlands
[2:47:13] <zenith0111> Spider-Man was a lot of fun
[2:47:17] <SomeAsianDood> But does this batman game let you drive a tank? Kappa
[2:47:19] <+2sappy> It handles like a telltale batman game, got it
[2:47:21] <TankMunky> So, is this effectively Samurai Red Dead?
[2:47:26] <%WhereIsWill> ghosts of sushi, JUST like Batman on the SNES
[2:47:27] <%Fien111> Birb is the worb
[2:47:33] <ChoculaUltra> Traversal, combat, collectibles - Spider-Man legit did all of that shit super duper right.
[2:47:34] <Spiralpower1620> yeah.... Batman dark tomorrow is my shit SeemsGood slySmug
[2:47:39] <Profmcstevie> The birds and the bees are in cahoots, don't believe their lies
[2:47:41] <%za7az> LEGO batman obviously KappaHD
[2:47:45] <RedPanda25> He obviously means VR telltale batman
[2:47:46] <+Ocaz> @PatStaresAt does this game make you feel like sword of tsushima?
[2:47:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> oh no, not the mongols Kappa
[2:47:51] <venomfury86> AC: Japan
[2:47:54] <jonesybot_5000> @Fien111 SeemsGood
[2:47:54] <hkgamingtv> SMOrc
[2:47:59] <Brofarian> my leeeeg
[2:48:00] <+Skelegroove> I do think open worlds sacrifice too much in terms of gameplay
[2:48:02] <Shyakuuu> Lol dark tomorrow
[2:48:04] <%DianaTheAscian> sounds busted
[2:48:05] <TheFramedWarlock> What's the combat system ? Is it literally just attack and parry/dodge when the game tells you to
[2:48:06] <Spiralpower1620> did he just go "MY LEG?!" Kappa LUL
[2:48:08] <%toastybites> ooo a traitor hall pass
[2:48:12] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt prob bs
[2:48:26] <+TheBitingIrish> Ubisoft: We have no plans of making an AC game set in feudal Japan.
[2:48:29] <ZE_Count> I always hear the spongebob my legg in my head
[2:48:37] <%Fooguwu> yeah wait this is literally just a better version of assassin's creed and in the setting we've always wanted
[2:48:44] <Daxalog> Hold Heavy to instakill dudesm etc.
[2:48:47] <+TheBitingIrish> Sucker Punch: Gonna make my own goddamn AC:Japan
[2:48:55] <+FlongBongle> Should I get this, chat?
[2:49:04] <SolsticeZro> but can you Midare Setsugekka twice
[2:49:05] <%IDTheftVictim> Oh no is there ccrafting?
[2:49:10] <ChoculaUltra> imagine an open world game with the combat depth of like a Devil May Cry
[2:49:11] <ZE_Count> There smore stuff
[2:49:13] <TheFramedWarlock> Oh cool so it actually has some depth
[2:49:18] <%DianaTheAscian> nice
[2:49:22] <OldManDeckardCain> Ubisoft: ninjas don't really fit our franchise.... vikings on the other hand...
[2:49:31] <ZE_Count> I mean upgrading weapons I would consider crafting
[2:49:32] <RetroCop87> So is this more like a Souls, or a BotW?
[2:49:33] <Clowns> if there's no crafting, what are the supplies and such for?
[2:49:39] <SomeAsianDood> but vikings are known for their stealth Kappa
[2:49:41] <%IDTheftVictim> Ok picking up that leather scared me
[2:49:41] <olaksi> The only good open-world games are the ones that don't expect you to explore
[2:49:45] <ChoculaUltra> upgrading
[2:49:47] <Profmcstevie> There's "reinforcing" so you still go around grabbing things in random huts and flowers on hills
[2:49:49] <hkgamingtv> DMC has combat depth?
[2:49:49] <OmegaTrigun> @Fooguwu Yes that's pretty much what it is. Japanese AC with better immersion.
[2:49:50] <TheFramedWarlock> Upgrades @clowns
[2:49:50] <Sternieliscious> It's "crafting" in the same way as tomb raider upgrades at camp.
[2:49:52] <+yukichocomilk> the particles in the air are literally the best part of this for me
[2:49:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Vikings are masters of subtlety and manipulating the history of man throughout the ages.
[2:50:01] <+TheBitingIrish> It's less crafting and more trading materials for upgrades
[2:50:02] <TankMunky> Is resource acquisition lenient, or is hoarding optimal?
[2:50:04] <%za7az> @FlongBongle I mean it's no Deadly Premonition 2, but it's decent KappaHD
[2:50:08] <venomfury86> Vikings - well known for their stealth Kappa
[2:50:08] <TheFramedWarlock> Bruh hkgaming
[2:50:08] <Gruhunchously> Use your Witcher senses
[2:50:10] <+TheBitingIrish> Which is kinda crafting LUL
[2:50:13] <+RowenCleric> its more like a witcher 3
[2:50:16] <Shyakuuu> Ubisoft: Japan is overdone tho. * makes viking game*
[2:50:17] <Clowns> @TheFramedWarlock i see, ty
[2:50:17] <TheFramedWarlock> DMC has ridiculous combat depth
[2:50:18] <ShichiNoBushi> Emloaf
[2:50:31] <OldManDeckardCain> be careful pat, elmo might pull off a hyper beam next round
[2:50:32] <Profmcstevie> They miss EVERY time Kappa
[2:50:39] <+TheBitingIrish> What was that dude doing LUL
[2:50:40] <OmegaTrigun> Also there's a total of 4 stances
[2:50:43] <%WhereIsWill> love the music in this
[2:50:49] <ZE_Count> might be time to turn the difficulty up
[2:50:50] <RiverBirch> Didnt the fuckin Mongols get fucked over by a Tsunami/Tornado ?
[2:50:51] <TankMunky> Mikiri counter!
[2:50:56] <hkgamingtv> I thought DMC was just about smashing buttons
[2:50:56] <RiverBirch> When they were fuckin with Japan?
[2:51:01] <TheFramedWarlock> Oh that makes it so much better
[2:51:22] <Shyakuuu> Thats after this
[2:51:22] <TheFramedWarlock> I hate Batman combat because the game just tells you when to parry which makes it ridiculously easy
[2:51:26] <OmegaTrigun> Also enemies don't just come at you one at a time. they WILL overwhelm you.
[2:51:39] <Gruhunchously> The eternal question when playing DMC - "Am I doing it right or am I just mashing buttons?"
[2:51:44] <Spiralpower1620> I hope Sly Cooper comes back.
[2:51:50] <%toastybites> @RiverBirch ancient civilization expansionism
[2:51:53] <%DianaTheAscian> like a real fight
[2:51:53] <zenith0111> @theframedwarlock Not on higher difficulties
[2:52:03] <%StaceMcGate> Has Sakai saved anyone this stream?
[2:52:06] <Gruhunchously> Harhs
[2:52:08] <Sternieliscious> I see sounds as tells, but are there visual ones? Maybe in the options?
[2:52:09] <hkgamingtv> Mashing buttons is doing it right in DMC
[2:52:11] <+JRC_N> Bruh u really not playing the game on japanese
[2:52:14] <+Skelegroove> This game seems to have more complex combat than most open world games but clearly lacks enemy variety
[2:52:18] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[2:52:18] <%Fien111> @RiverBirch The invaded this island, won a couple small battles, but realized the needed more guys. Second invasion was supposed to be bigger (but not the half a million folks always claim) but it got sunk by a tsunami.
[2:52:23] <Shyakuuu> They did actually get to outer islands like this one
[2:52:26] <%weissguard> Himself? psaBougie
[2:52:27] <Khorneflakes_> Not even himself
[2:52:27] <%Typhaeon> Hundreds of years later, his descendant Hiroyuki will save Japanese-French cuisine
[2:52:28] <Clowns> he saved that one dude and his baby at the beginning of the game
[2:52:30] <+ImTrin> is he supposed to save anyone?
[2:52:37] <%za7az> What a hero LUL
[2:52:39] <%Venetianmonster2> Venetianmonster2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! been awhile since ive made it due to work now im able to make it since i now have covid much fun
[2:52:43] <%DianaTheAscian> eh dying wish i guess u can try
[2:52:51] <Gruhunchously> "Without power you can't save anyone, let alone yourself"
[2:52:52] <hkgamingtv> He's supposed to save his honor
[2:52:55] <Cleric4gg> he was ghosting everyone Kappa
[2:52:57] <guynoon> why does this combat and gameplay loop seem kinda wild hunt like?
[2:52:59] <OmegaTrigun> @Sternieliscious The only visuals are the little shines. Red are unblockable. Blue are parry only.
[2:53:06] <Spiralpower1620> jin Sakai is Terry McGinnis slySmug
[2:53:11] <Khorneflakes_> spooky
[2:53:18] <+FlongBongle> Is this going to fill the void in my heart that Way of the Samurai left?

[2:53:50] <$Afterman_> yes
[2:53:54] <TheFramedWarlock> Shoot it
[2:53:56] <Sternieliscious> Ah, so no tells for arrows. Deafness sucks. At least the melee tells look good.
[2:53:59] <%toastybites> it was a bear after all
[2:54:00] <Gruhunchously> A FUCKING BEAR
[2:54:01] <%indig0bird> Bow!

[2:54:14] <%StaceMcGate> these are small bears
[2:54:16] <%DianaTheAscian> kinda small
[2:54:17] <Daxalog> This bear has Honour
[2:54:18] <%Fien111> Welcome to Goat Chesse Tzatziki with ya boy, Jimmy Sacks!
[2:54:22] <ClutchSuts> That's for Leo Dicaprio
[2:54:29] <TheFramedWarlock> Aw no skinning animation
[2:54:30] <Gruhunchously> I think video games, and media in general, kind of understate how dangerous bears are.
[2:54:36] <OmegaTrigun> @Sternieliscious There is an option I saw in settings to give a visual warning when being shot with projectiles from off screen. So there's that.
[2:54:41] <Shyakuuu> BEAW PogChamp
[2:54:55] <TankMunky> I wouldn't trust any wind that leads you to angry bears.
[2:55:00] <$Afterman_> @FlongBongle game is very fun. played from 11-3am last night and then 12-5 today

[3:01:04] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> People saved count: still 0
[3:01:04] <+storkeylope> You did it! You saved a guy!
[3:01:06] <olaksi> This game looks to be goto A: find white noise dialogue, goto B: kill same 4 enemies again

[3:01:38] <%count_bob> He's already drowning himself.
[3:01:43] <%joylent_blue> you can't save him from crushing depression

[3:02:09] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you also saved that one guy getting shot with arrows in a bridge
[3:02:12] <mar_krow> honorably gut myself to keep honor

[3:05:27] <mar_krow> this ain't skyrim
[3:05:27] <%indig0bird> You should upgrade your gear first
[3:05:28] <+Javaa01> Your legs have in fact exploded, yes
[3:05:29] <%Maids4lyfe> it's the one led by Kublai Khan
[3:05:32] <TomFrancis_> KEKW
[3:05:34] <arkv01> I see you have put points into stronger ankles

[3:05:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Anime might not have been invented yet, but Japan clearly had the power of gods on their side. Or weather is just fucked there.

[3:06:03] <hkgamingtv> ryu hyubasa
[3:06:07] <%DianaTheAscian> i thought the first invasion didn't even make it past the sea?
[3:06:12] <%indig0bird> I thought you had some armor upgrades
[3:06:13] <arkv01> weather is ultra fucked
[3:06:15] <%IDTheftVictim> What was that Flute of Time s*** that loading screen was talking about
[3:06:22] <hkgamingtv> throw a hadukan
[3:06:30] <zenith0111> Pat hasn't been to a new area in a while. This map is way bigger than I thought
[3:06:45] <hkgamingtv> shoryuken!
[3:06:45] <+mMayrro> yum sashimi banners
[3:06:46] <nw_kero> @DianaTheAscian it's on a little island between japan and korea called tsushima
[3:06:56] <%joylent_blue> yeyeyeye
[3:06:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Black gift?
[3:07:04] <olaksi> Ancient invaders were just kind of dumb sometimes: "Yeah I can totally march elephants through the alps no prob"
[3:07:04] <Gamer76255> Given how they repel the Mongols, weather being fucked does make sense
[3:07:09] <%albret__einstrong> the real mongol invasion of tsushima lasted about five minutes because the japanese had like 80 dudes, total and ate shit
[3:07:09] <%indig0bird> Bow upgrade!
[3:07:12] <mar_krow> the smell of decay in the woods
[3:07:21] <%count_bob> That wasn't dumb.
[3:07:24] <%Faustgesicht> Upgrade my horrifically cursed bow, please
[3:07:25] <Gruhunchously> @olaksi In his defense, it worked.
[3:07:27] <%Fien111> @GeneralSCPatton It's pretty fucked. Though, oddly enough, after Japan surrendered in WW2 the giant US fleet that went to occupy it got hit and FUCKED by a nasty Tsunami that sunk more ships than all the kamekazi strikes put together. Gods were late to the punch on that one, I guess
[3:07:28] <hkgamingtv> yeah run though those leaves
[3:07:29] <%count_bob> That was calculated.
[3:07:31] <zenith0111> @olaksi "Winter isn't a big deal"
[3:07:38] <%NoahilDuce> i hope this game ends with you summoning a tsunami

[3:11:50] <NocturnalRites> How are you fans but haven't seen Kung Pow?
[3:11:53] <@SoFarFetched> @jmcclellan18 he has because people keep saying it in chat.
[3:11:54] <%joylent_blue> yes jmcclellan18 he did
[3:11:58] <%blastyoboots> If you don't understand his comment about Ventriloquists watch Kung Pow: Enter the Fist
[3:12:01] <SolsticeZro> pepeHmm
[3:12:04] <Gruhunchously> Those people are super dead
[3:12:05] <+Joe2187> Is this just Red Dead Japan?
[3:12:05] <stabbityrabbit> Can someone explain the B O O M E R reference?
[3:12:06] <+jmcclellan18> My bad guys
[3:12:08] <zenith0111> That's why writers tell you to reference as many things as possible Kappa
[3:12:10] <%AncelDeLambert> it aint that interesting folks

[3:12:31] <BoneofMalkav> "We trained him wrong, as a joke."
[3:12:32] <%blastyoboots> @stabbityrabbit it was because they were talking without their mouth moving, a Kung Pow: Enter the Fist reference
[3:12:37] <nw_kero> wish you could use a kusarigama in this game
[3:12:40] <Zasirel> @PatStaresAt juts be aware of TINY nets
[3:12:44] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> I’m falling, you’re falling, we’re falling, WHAAAALE!
[3:12:45] <%albret__einstrong> the duels are funny to me because the japanese ate shit aganst the mongols because the mongols didn't oblige their single combat bullshit
[3:12:46] <zenith0111> @joe2187 Red Dead had more to do than just killing enemies and one main weapon type. This game is good but definitely not living up to the hype
[3:12:52] <%logoth_> How do you like my nuts to your fist style
[3:12:54] <@SoFarFetched> "I....CANNOT..BE DEFEATED....BY A ...TINY NET"
[3:12:59] <%Ninestempest> @AncelDeLambert what did he do this time
[3:13:00] <+Loinclothiclese> ITS A NET AND ITS TINY
[3:13:00] <+yukichocomilk> tiny nets are deadly
[3:13:03] <WUFFLEBEAM_PRIME> this visuals are breathtaking
[3:13:03] <Simez291> is thia a red dead redemption dlc ? LUL
[3:13:06] <NocturnalRites> Let me know if you see a Radio Shack
[3:13:11] <%AncelDeLambert> I'll reverse the capture process and YAAHH!
[3:13:18] <ShichiNoBushi> I thought he said "tiny hats" which I'm sure Pat is always looking out for.
[3:13:19] <+Loinclothiclese> you want fries with that!
[3:13:22] <%Mrbaconator> DO YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT BAYBEE
[3:13:22] <%logoth_> Go. Get a Driiinkkk. Perhaps a carb-o-nated-so-dah???
[3:13:24] <SomeAsianDood> We purposely trained him wrong.... as a joke
[3:13:26] <%BubbaRands> TINY NET?! WutFace
[3:13:27] <%Fien111> In that moment, Pat learned an important lesson about Mongol Iron Claws......THEY HURT LIKE CRAP, MAN!
[3:13:27] <TheSaltminer> A TINY NET IS A DEATH SENTENCE, IT'S A NET AND IT'S TINY
[3:13:28] <%AncelDeLambert> @Ninestempest fuck if I know but the man is basically bullet-proof
[3:13:30] <+Ahnassi> Not having to get off the horse to pick shit up looks amazing
[3:13:31] <Tucker0603> IM A MAN TOO YOU KNOW?! I go pee pee standing up!
[3:13:35] <hkgamingtv> people hyped this game because of the LoU controversy
[3:13:35] <+Loinclothiclese> net does not sound like hat @ShichiNoBushi LUL
[3:13:35] <+jmcclellan18> Nice
[3:13:37] <Ner234> So I just asked myself: "Has SunhiLegend made any sick gifs of this game yet?" He has in fact.
[3:13:38] <+Joe2187> If the combat is good enough it might be better than Red Dead
[3:13:39] <@SoFarFetched> "I'm bleeding...making me the victor"

[3:13:56] <SpaceGuntank> i mean i'm no doctor, but thats one clean gut chunk!
[3:13:59] <+mMayrro> only needs to desintegrate the dudes and its the destiny shoulder charge
[3:14:05] <zenith0111> If this game wasn't so hyped up I could see this being like a $20 game
[3:14:05] <Profmcstevie> If you tackle into a wall I bet you can catch a air combo off the wallbounce
[3:14:06] <TomFrancis_> this dudes a linebacker
[3:14:06] <%joylent_blue> bandit chic

[3:14:28] <%Mrbaconator> WEE OO WEE
[3:14:31] <%BubbaRands> Taco Bell~ Taco Bell~ Product Placement With Taco Bell!
[3:14:37] <olaksi> Is he yelling "get down!" before shooting you? seems counterproductive
[3:14:47] <hkgamingtv> fuck off with this Japan invented hockey nonsense
[3:14:48] <SolsticeZro> you know you ded when he deflects yo arrow
[3:14:48] <Joustar_> NotLikeThis Kung-pow in my chat

[3:14:49] <%NWR_James> bug skill
[3:14:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> I'm interested in how this is being received in Japan
[3:14:53] <+mMayrro> jumping attack from your whores
[3:14:55] <%DianaTheAscian> horse tech PogChamp
[3:14:56] <arkv01> even the 1v1 punchouts in hockey are inspired by smaurai duels
[3:14:57] <Ipsenscastle> Where is Zandatsu?
[3:15:07] <+deviljhojho_> big whores
[3:15:09] <%C0baltCrusade> @OneThousandTomatoes quite well, actually
[3:15:11] <strangelee> their's an achievement for doing a max standoff streak though
[3:15:11] <%logoth_> horse combos
[3:15:13] <+deviljhojho_> atack
[3:15:16] <%C0baltCrusade> japanese reviewers seem to quite like it
[3:15:19] <+Javaa01> I mean, if you're using standoffs this much, you might as well spec into it
[3:15:20] <hkgamingtv> Zangetsu?
[3:15:21] <%Metballs> I think those were Japanese bandits, so he understood them
[3:15:22] <%Fien111> Eenie Meanie Minie Mo. I wonder where....my glove....will go
[3:15:25] <+dayz1003> I haven't seen kung pow since I was in 20 years.
[3:15:29] <AerisRoivas> Why no standoff streak? It’s great
[3:15:32] <arkv01> I'd probably run if big whores attacked ScaredyCat
[3:15:36] <%Niney_Who> "Kill another while the first bleeds" is strong
[3:15:37] <%blastyoboots> !!!BIG HORSE ATTACK!!!
[3:15:48] <hkgamingtv> Zangestu as played by David Hayter

[3:16:17] <+StonerStan101> @PatStaresAt So this Afro Samurai Levels, or Samurai Champloo?
[3:16:17] <arkv01> do the bears whisper funny memes
[3:16:19] <+mMayrro> evil man on tower
[3:16:20] <strangelee> there's an archer across the way
[3:16:20] <AFlyingTaco1> So wait, there's no option to put it in Japanese only?
[3:16:23] <eyezehuhh> Mongolian,yes
[3:16:25] <%joylent_blue> is that a lookout tower or something
[3:16:27] <%za7az> @ChoculaUltra Obviously

[3:16:56] <+mMayrro> big blind LUL
[3:16:57] <OneThousandTomatoes> is Jin, or his Uncle, Lord of Tsushima?
[3:16:58] <%Ninestempest> @AFlyingTaco1 you basically choose if japanese people speak in english or japanese
[3:16:59] <@SoFarFetched> its just on English because pat knows theres people who multitask and just watch the st ream.
[3:17:04] <BoneofMalkav> "Killing is bad and wrong, Killing is Badong. I will be the opposite of Badong, Gnobdab."

[3:17:07] <hkgamingtv> Hello, welcome to shitty shushi may I take ur order?
[3:17:08] <@SoFarFetched> also too many people complained when it wasnt in english for games.
[3:17:08] <%GameBreakingOfficial> GameBreakingOfficial subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:17:11] <mar_krow> better get the duolingo ready to understand better
[3:17:14] <Joustar_> freakin' blind
[3:17:17] <%king_wragles> @AFlyingTaco1 for the most part yes, but it will only change the English spoken part. If someone is speaking (let's just say) Dutch then it will stay Dutch on account of Jin not knowing how to speak said language.
[3:17:18] <%Typhaeon> Looks doable
[3:17:25] <nw_kero> mongolian is a cool language and their traditional wrestling is cool too. knew a mongolian guy in college
[3:17:28] <Sternieliscious> I'm loving the shadowboxing leader.

[3:18:43] <mar_krow> i've probably seen a lot of Mongolian ppl in my life time and didn't know
[3:18:46] <hkgamingtv> Kill Temujin's heirs
[3:18:51] <Simez291> get gud
[3:18:53] <zenith0111> @rawrmeowxd You only get to use your sword and bow. No daggers or spears

[3:19:16] <%king_wragles> @SpaceGuntank "Ah, it's just Joe dying again. Classic Joe"
[3:19:17] <zenith0111> @rawrmeowxd That's why some people said it's like shadows of Mordor
[3:19:19] <ZE_Count> now kill for point

[3:20:55] <%NoahilDuce> yea, that was one complaint i heard
[3:20:58] <%AzureGale> Water stance is effective against fire stance
[3:20:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> LEADER HERE
[3:21:04] <SolsticeZro> Water if effective against shields
[3:21:05] <%joylent_blue> BUT WERE YOU?

[3:21:51] <Ipsenscastle> You almost understand water
[3:21:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat studied the blade
[3:21:59] <hkgamingtv> bother!
[3:22:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> DID YOU KNOW: The spear has a pointy bit at the end, avoid this part.
[3:22:03] <BoneofMalkav> "Mongolians, Bandits! What you gonna do, when my Sharp Blade and 28 Inch Pythons runs wild on you!?"
[3:22:06] <Profmcstevie> Huh, so observing gets a bar and killing gets a bar. optimal

[3:22:20] <+mMayrro> oh fuck
[3:22:22] <rawrmeowxd> @zenith0111 Isn't that a Nagitama?
[3:22:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> SMOOTH
[3:22:27] <Gruhunchously> Whenever someone says 'Studied the blade' I just imagine them contemplating a blade for hours.
[3:22:33] <+ALazo> I still can't get over how that sword raised stance looks when you're walking around
[3:22:38] <hkgamingtv> sword battle isn't realistic, they should be using spears
[3:22:39] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT PAT
[3:22:44] <%C0baltCrusade> SWITCH YOUR DAMN STANCES
[3:22:56] <bluebiscuit94> The word you're looking for is NAGINATA not NAGITMA, and no that's a bow
[3:23:01] <%derekwst3> sphere hunter uploaded a bayonetta video

[3:23:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> now get that composite bow
[3:23:40] <nw_kero> idk how yur supposed to bash through someones shield just by hitting it really hard
[3:23:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> Composite bows are much better
[3:23:51] <olaksi> knifespear
[3:23:53] <scrublord009> Katana means Dead Mongol in Japanese
[3:23:58] <+mMayrro> ended his suffering :)
[3:24:00] <+yukichocomilk> is this the game where chat pretends to know about history?
[3:24:01] <hkgamingtv> oh I know, i'm just regurgitating grabage

[3:24:11] <Flarepulse> press square to end suffering
[3:24:11] <rawrmeowxd> @zenith0111 SO THERE ARE NAGITAMAS? DOES THE BOSS USE ONE?
[3:24:17] <%Fien111> The Yumi is a composite bow
[3:24:21] <Gruhunchously> Katana means 'dead mofo' in Japanese
[3:24:23] <%Maids4lyfe> there's another item in the stable

[3:24:52] <zenith0111> @yukichocomilk It's almost like someone was trying to teach generations of people history Kappa

[3:31:33] <+OwlLightningMage> School sucks
[3:31:34] <bluebiscuit94> You learned Math and Writing in school
[3:31:34] <+xeros720> you need to go to school for a reason, school can't be the reason
[3:31:35] <%DianaTheAscian> 70% of stuff in school is pointless

[3:55:47] <$zyberion626> "Man sure is quiet out here"
[3:55:48] <%IDTheftVictim> So is this as good as TLOU2 yet? psaPorgmo
[3:55:58] <AFlyingTaco1> Nioh 2's biggest problem is that every boss is basically a puzzle with a fuckton of health, and if you don't do it properly, it'll either be aay more difficult or outright unbeatable.
[3:56:23] <%derekwst3> is that guts
[3:56:24] <Ipsenscastle> uhhh
[3:56:24] <%AzureGale> How does Jin know that they're all dead
[3:56:25] <+Javaa01> Yes
[3:56:26] <+xeros720> ya think?
[3:56:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> probably
[3:56:28] <Gruhunchously> LUL
[3:56:29] <narusao> FailFish
[3:56:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> guess not
[3:56:30] <+TheBitingIrish> Probably

[3:56:42] <dinnydanny777> Samurai are fireproof
[3:56:42] <SolsticeZro> lmao for a second I thought it was a game over screen
[3:56:43] <%joylent_blue> why would you ever try to compare this to TLOU2
[3:56:48] <+xeros720> oh, that was a mission title
[3:56:49] <%Typhaeon> Jesus, burn down the entire forest while you're at it
[3:56:52] <StripesUltimateEdition> maybe burning down a base in the woods isn't a great idea
[3:56:53] <%M3djedx> psaBougie
[3:56:58] <%toolofparanoia> FUCK YEAH ARSON!
[3:57:03] <%derekwst3> burn the burn city
[3:57:08] <zenith0111> @joylent_blue Because some people apparently really loved it

[3:57:56] <%joylent_blue> zenith0111 doesn't even have anything to do with how good either one is, they're completely different games lol
[3:58:03] <dinnydanny777> Does Sora have a mother
[3:58:03] <%Fien111> @zenith0111 Either a part missing or a rather some parts that SHOULD be missinbg

[3:59:06] <guynoon> DOOT
[3:59:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Lame
[3:59:11] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Your twitter followers suck
[3:59:14] <tusk102> so not a full playthrough of this?
[3:59:17] <hkgamingtv> Deet
[3:59:19] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> But...Youre the best one playing this...
[3:59:19] <guynoon> P4G would be nice
[3:59:25] <%StaceMcGate> and a random number
[3:59:26] <%IDTheftVictim> And very specific?
[3:59:26] <@SoFarFetched> they must be in another country
[3:59:26] <%king_wragles> And oddly specific?
[3:59:29] <+OwlLightningMage> PogChamp
[3:59:29] <@SoFarFetched> maybe
[3:59:32] <%M3djedx> P4G would be dope
[3:59:35] <%SvenHolgersson> O L D
[3:59:36] <%BubbaRands> 29 CENTS PogChamp
[3:59:37] <%joylent_blue> start a P4G playthrough and then abandon it half way through Kappa
[3:59:39] <hkgamingtv> LoU2 playthrough?
[3:59:40] <%za7az> I like the sound of P4G
[3:59:41] <+xeros720> youtube always kind of sucked
[3:59:45] <%SvenHolgersson> STREAM BOOMER
[3:59:49] <%Nekros4442> If we're doing another Persona game then i'd rather see Persona 3 FES as femprotag
[3:59:50] <venomfury86> what dou you think of the game, Pat?
[3:59:52] <audrus> paige galaxy brain
[3:59:53] <%SvenHolgersson> A STROOMER
[3:59:56] <hkgamingtv> where fuck is my fucking gabbaghoul?
[3:59:59] <%Mdub98> Mdub98 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hey it’s been 15 months that’s wild. Thanks for all the laughs and inspiring me to build my own pc and start streaming!
[4:00:00] <@SoFarFetched> Paige was the first streamer
[4:00:02] <coracor> the bouvin dick whiff
[4:00:03] <$zyberion626> @joylent_blue you mean right after he finishes the tutorial
[4:00:04] <+xeros720> pat was all, "mixlr is the future"
[4:00:05] <%StaceMcGate> "He showed me dick..."
[4:00:06] <%joylent_blue> paige was here first :(
[4:00:07] <+xeros720> and paige was right
[4:00:17] <%AzureGale> Comedy bold
[4:00:17] <Ipsenscastle> fuck, nailed it
[4:00:18] <audrus> paige was the ALPHA streamer
[4:00:18] <%joylent_blue> zyberion626 naturally
[4:00:31] <hkgamingtv> Paige is actually playing and not Pat
[4:00:36] <leinadtonu> Paige is the OG
[4:00:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> "I showed him the future, he showed me dick"
[4:00:43] <SolsticeZro> I thought there is a big gap behind that couch how can Elmo lie there without falling off
[4:00:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Comedy Mold!
[4:00:46] <antshadow14> wheeez
[4:00:48] <audrus> pat holds a fake unplugged controller
[4:00:49] <hkgamingtv> OG Paige
[4:00:52] <%ExpressNode> Guess he didn't outlast them all
[4:00:57] <%Fien111> "Can I Twitch?" NO! "Ok, but do you know how to even Twitch?" NO! "if I help you, can I Twitch?" SKELETON BONERS!
[4:00:57] <+lethallylactic> I'm confused
[4:00:59] <%joylent_blue> seems weird
[4:00:59] <arkv01> wow, the fuck is going on with twitch?
[4:01:00] <%Typhaeon> But were his subs refunded like Doc's
[4:01:03] <antshadow14> dsp got banned wheez
[4:01:08] <%clockworknate> i just heard dsp got banned!
[4:01:09] <audrus> should i care about any of that shit??
[4:01:10] <+ALazo> comedy bald?
[4:01:15] <Ipsenscastle> and the connection between both is that they both seem shady as fuck
[4:01:18] <%Robot_Nixon_> AND WE STILL KNOW NOTHING
[4:01:20] <%YakumoYomi> Lawyer answers
[4:01:27] <%Nekros4442> Meh who cares. DSP will endure like a cockroach as always
[4:01:28] <hkgamingtv> Dr Disrespect!!!!
[4:01:29] <+Steamed_Hagao> probably lawyers telling him not to say anything
[4:01:34] <arkv01> hmmm...
[4:01:43] <%BubbaRands> ew
[4:01:45] <@SoFarFetched> dodged the question
[4:01:46] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[4:01:48] <%joylent_blue> hmmmmmmmmmmm
[4:01:48] <arkv01> that doesn't explain why LTG got banned
[4:01:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> @SolsticeZro There's a hard back on the couchh and a cushion, so elmo is lying on the cushion mostly
[4:01:51] <%Mdub98> Does DSP have anywhere else to go?
[4:01:51] <SolsticeZro> they usually deserve it
[4:01:52] <audrus> big dots.........
[4:01:53] <narusao> uh...
[4:01:54] <leinadtonu> ...
[4:01:55] <heartlesshealer> dude wow
[4:01:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> PERFECT PARRY THAT QUESTION
[4:01:56] <%Typhaeon> I mean the only sex-related drama with him concerned a consensual affair
[4:01:57] <%Dementedpenguin> That's an unsettling non-answer
[4:01:59] <%zamzoph> lawyers
[4:02:01] <%BubbaRands> SUCCESSFULLY DODGED
[4:02:02] <%WhereIsWill> parried the question
[4:02:03] <%Fien111> >Publicist steps in "We're getting into some dangerous territory here"
[4:02:07] <%SummonerMagno> X to doubt
[4:02:07] <narusao> no?
[4:02:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> are you paraphrasing....
[4:02:09] <hkgamingtv> twitch is dumb
[4:02:16] <%BubbaRands> NO A-
[4:02:16] <scrublord009> BAD TOUCH CONFIRMED???
[4:02:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Publicist knows their job
[4:02:25] <%Typhaeon> Thanks for nothing Slasher by the way
[4:02:27] <%AncelDeLambert> ALWAYS A GOOD PLAN TO SHUT THE FUCK UP
[4:02:29] <heartlesshealer> WOW
[4:02:31] <@SoFarFetched> I bet if Dr disrespects thing got found out,it would ruin twitch.
[4:02:32] <+xeros720> yeah, can't talk about an ongoing case
[4:02:34] <hkgamingtv> drama
[4:02:36] <leinadtonu> mmmmm....
[4:02:37] <%Mdub98> Big crime
[4:02:37] <arkv01> you can just ban based on suspicions?
[4:02:38] <Darksolerino> DSP will survive. He always does
[4:02:41] <%YakumoYomi> Legal action is probably going on in the background
[4:02:41] <%Fien111> People have pointed out that either lawyers or cops are obviously involved on either side
[4:02:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> No one knows, its just he publicist wants to avoid any shit
[4:02:44] <%zamzoph> lawyers all the way down
[4:02:44] <%ExpressNode> Think they are planning a lawsuit and therefore they are stay quiet?
[4:02:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Hey, are you being interviewed and the interviewer asks a dodgy question? SHUT THE FUCK UP
[4:02:46] <reonome> DSP tho
[4:02:52] <%Typhaeon> Twitch can ban for any reason really
[4:02:53] <devanmuse> is this about dsp or disrespect?
[4:02:53] <zenith0111> Dr.Disrepect is coming back though
[4:02:55] <audrus> im shocked someone who would choose his name as dr disrespect would be a bad man
[4:02:59] <%AncelDeLambert> "But I'm innocent!" Don't matter, SHUT THE FUCK UP
[4:03:02] <@SoFarFetched> this is currently about disrespect
[4:03:02] <%Robot_Nixon_> yes I believe so
[4:03:06] <hkgamingtv> I didn't even know who Dr Disrespect was untill this stupid drama
[4:03:13] <+jaybaggins> dsp is literally the villain of ghost of tsushima
[4:03:15] <Ipsenscastle> Now I'm not a fancy big city lawyer...
[4:03:15] <leinadtonu> Pat the consultant.
[4:03:24] <%Fien111> Dr. Disrespect is like the top 5 of all Twitch, they're not just gonna say "fuck that guy!" that made them SO MUCH MONEY if they could help it
[4:03:24] <audrus> @hkgamingtv right who the fuck is that
[4:03:26] <$zyberion626> in this case, the correct answer to this is to shut the fuck up and listen to your lawyers
[4:03:28] <guynoon> Of course, no lawyer wouldve gone to machinima
[4:03:33] <+xeros720> i can't imagine actually trying to sue an amazon owned company
[4:03:34] <%SvenHolgersson> Welp this might be one of the last Pat streams then
[4:03:34] <hkgamingtv> Pat with the l;egal advice
[4:03:34] <%Typhaeon> DSP will be the hero we need and blow the lid off this case
[4:03:36] <%joylent_blue> oh boy!
[4:03:38] <OldManDeckardCain> you beat Phoenix Wright, that's close enough to being a lawyer
[4:03:38] <%SvenHolgersson> Rip
[4:03:39] <audrus> pat dont get banned i only watch you and paige
[4:03:39] <Cleric4gg> LUL
[4:03:41] <%Nekros4442> To be fair, DSP has survived way more than Doc lol
[4:03:47] <%Dementedpenguin> DSP is gonna go Ultra Instinct, just you wait.
[4:03:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Twitch fucking banned OppaiPantsuu for her username, with no warning, even though she could change it if asked.
[4:03:55] <BoneofMalkav> even if DSP consulted a lawyer, he'd say something stupid regardless lol
[4:03:57] <%Nekros4442> DSP is a tank and Doc is a DPS
[4:03:59] <%AncelDeLambert> DSP will be back, the man is more resilient than cockroaches
[4:04:06] <%Mdub98> Did he start jerking it again?
[4:04:07] <Ipsenscastle> DSP has already survived way longer than anyone could have reasonably expected him to
[4:04:12] <hkgamingtv> it's all about $$$$$$$
[4:04:15] <%joylent_blue> i think you mean WholesomeCumiesPeddler
[4:04:16] <%ExpressNode> Maybe he can actually give us some insight to what the fuck is going on at Twitch
[4:04:18] <%joylent_blue> pvpSass
[4:04:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> the CoD clip is woolies new stream ender
[4:04:30] <hkgamingtv> anybody who thinks otherwise is a fucking fool
[4:04:32] <antshadow14> just wait dsp will kill himself
[4:04:33] <audrus> can you make yourself the big pat?
[4:04:35] <$zyberion626> DSP's demise is the merely the start of Ragnarok
[4:04:40] <%zamzoph> bay-ble
[4:04:43] <venomfury86> DSP survived fuckin' EVO
[4:04:45] <heartlesshealer> fuck
[4:04:50] <zenith0111> Emulators fucking suck man
[4:04:53] <+cdrom321> Bayble
[4:04:59] <%Fien111> I think Dr. Disrespect got banned for that fucking mustache and I completely agree and support Twitch on that
[4:05:03] <hkgamingtv> gay mers unite!
[4:05:07] <heartlesshealer> that bug sounds fucking horrible
[4:05:12] <+Finaldragoon> Twitch has dropped bans on multiple vtubers because their avatar was violating the clothing rules
[4:05:19] <hkgamingtv> ..............................
[4:05:21] <arkv01> thats fuuucke
[4:05:25] <SolsticeZro> insider tech
[4:05:26] <reonome> that is some jank shit
[4:05:26] <%joylent_blue> Fien111 you're right and you should say it
[4:05:28] <+Skelegroove> PS3 emulator barely functions. Can get Demon's Souls running at 60 though
[4:05:31] <+WutangchickeN> Or you could just live dangerously you coward :)
[4:05:34] <+InsaneJackLondon> I mean you could save scum I suppose
[4:05:37] <%AzureGale> Ouch
[4:05:48] <%SvenHolgersson> COVID BOYS
[4:05:51] <%SvenHolgersson> WHERE YOU AT
[4:05:53] <%Typhaeon> Pat, they can't transmit the coof to you via donations
[4:05:54] <+WutangchickeN> He doesn't wanna catch covid through the money
[4:05:55] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[4:05:56] <Ipsenscastle> it cant be transmitted over the internet, Pat
[4:05:57] <@SoFarFetched> yeah cause you can either be fine with COVID,or you just get the most horrible COVID.
[4:05:59] <venomfury86> Twitch probably doesn't like streamers wearing vests
[4:06:03] <%clockworknate> no excuse if your not sick , you must sub!!! lmao
[4:06:03] <%IDTheftVictim> COVID CREW
[4:06:04] <hkgamingtv> Wu Tang Clan ain't nothing to fuck with
