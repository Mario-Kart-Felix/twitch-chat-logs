[0:03:18] <%Ixiah> @AngriestPat why do you call it parsing and not Dps meter ? :P
[0:03:19] <@mothmandraws> is it just chatrooms
[0:03:24] <ColRedyx> @mothmandraws Yes
[0:03:24] <@mothmandraws> are there any useful general ones
[0:03:30] <AdmiralButtloaf> not even ddos?
[0:03:32] <Angry_Ev1L> @BlitzNeidhart pretty much every streamer that raids use parser openly live on stream

[0:03:37] <jimmytwofeet> PAT WHA HAPPUN
[0:03:38] <Fuji_Apples> now the question is: should one buy the cloud strife card for 1 mil MGP?
[0:03:47] <%BlitzNeidhart> @Ixiah It does more than measure DPS, and it's just the accepted terminology
[0:03:49] <Monkeyweed21> They let you push the plebs out
[0:03:50] <$Valdorick> Its in game Discord chat, basically.
[0:03:50] <@CreepyPorpoise> THere are Hunt and crafting Linkshells
[0:03:57] <%Ixiah> :/
[0:04:01] <+KalMyre> @Fuji_Apples well, I did Kappa
[0:04:08] <+MisterCrimson> I love how Lost City Hard was a preview of Shadowbringers
[0:04:08] <Monkeyweed21> Use the MGP on the bunny outfit
[0:04:08] <ShichiNoBushi> And lose your job.
[0:04:12] <Bad1uck> @mothmandraws There are Hunt linkshells for hunting named monsters that give tokens and boosted EXP

[0:05:40] <Calek> the more players in a dungeon the better, when's 48 man raids
[0:05:40] <+Zepshire> i've been to some terrible 24 mans
[0:05:42] <Angry_Ev1L> In general nobody will tell you shit as long as you're competent
[0:05:45] <@mothmandraws> I thought it was glamour
[0:05:45] <ColRedyx> Raiding is the BEST part of MMOs Kreygasm
[0:05:46] <Basch71> you honestly don't need parsers, its only if you wanna see your numbers
[0:05:46] <TheNocturnalScotsman> nier raid is soon tho
[0:05:47] <%D33TR> as a former hardcore raider in WoW, it is very over rated
[0:05:48] <Supabait> big number PogChamp
[0:05:52] <Resderp> Doton is a player buff, technically. It's the same reason Scholars cant have Shadow Flare and Sacred Ground up or whatever their bubble is.
[0:05:56] <%MegboyManuel> Glamour was the true endgame though
[0:05:56] <Angry_Ev1L> And if they do you can BAN THEM. REPORT THEM
[0:05:57] <%BlitzNeidhart> But the biggest numbers are from raiding 🤔 ?
[0:06:01] <+Ell1ot> i just want to play with my FF space doll
[0:06:03] <$Valdorick> Playing with your Pals is the joy of an MMO! That's why WoWfugees are becoming more common!
[0:06:04] <IndoorSitup> but whaf if you dont have pals?
[0:06:07] <%Ixiah> @AngriestPat how fast is your Internet and how much do you pay your Evil Overlord for it ?
[0:06:09] <%castcode> rip
[0:06:09] <psycho_bullet_festival> @AngriestPat But I raid so I can get big number faster then other people
[0:06:14] <%Lapinelis> @Angry_Ev1L Not really, a lot of the shit talkers suck the worst
[0:06:16] <ittla> @AngriestPat dont you need to raid for big number gear?
[0:06:17] <ColRedyx> Well yeah hardcore raiding isn't worth the time, but a bit of casual raiding is the most fun thing to do.
[0:06:21] <+technosasquatch> Evening Pat
[0:06:21] <haveswordmuststing> time to stop streaming ff14 Kappa
[0:06:23] <+Tnick1> Hey pat! You were the one who got me into this game and I love it! Best MMO I;ve ever played. Been leveling up a healer and also playing Manderville as I wait for new Expansion
[0:06:23] <Rotharn> parsing in 4man/20man/8man(reg) = dick waving, parsing in 8man(savage) = necessary for endgame progression groups
[0:06:24] <%TheSniperJoe> @BlitzNeidhart Actually, it depends? Crafting grear in XIV when melded properly can be incredibly competitive with top end raiding gear.
[0:06:24] <Monkeyweed21> But Why Big Number if No RAID
[0:06:26] <Angry_Ev1L> @Basch71 how would you know if you do enough damage for class you're playing tho??
[0:06:31] <%Divryne> Those 300 people got offed by the DDoS ninjas.
[0:06:34] <+DesertOfSand> Should I play FF14 just for the mahjong?
[0:06:39] <%Hasmuffins92> @AngriestPat You do a apatBig good, Pat!
[0:06:42] <Daniel_Is_I> Pat, you've got 1000 people watching you play FFXIV. That's successful.
[0:06:44] <%BlitzNeidhart> @TheSniperJoe That's gonna change in ShB
[0:06:46] <+MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat so what you're saying is that you're ready for Stadia
[0:06:49] <%Metballs> But raid makes bigger number
[0:06:49] <%Ixiah> mudra mudra mudra
[0:06:51] <%MegboyManuel> I block big numbers with my BRICK
[0:06:51] <Monkeyweed21> But big number don't matter if no hard
[0:06:51] <%FreyRune> @ittla nah, you can get good gear from farming 24 man raids or hunts
[0:06:52] <%Cthulos> apatHoldon It's fije
[0:06:56] <Resderp> @DesertOfSand There's content for everyone. Do what you think you'd enjoy
[0:06:58] <%Cthulos> fine even
[0:06:59] <+Ell1ot> don't you do raid to get stuff to make number bigger?
[0:07:00] <%korth367> @AngriestPat why dont you use katon
[0:07:06] <tealwolf26> Big number went past integer cap and broke stream.
[0:07:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh hey it's not-Odin
[0:07:13] <ColRedyx> But anyway, no reason to be scared of raids and parsing. If you care about your performance then you can easily become good. Just takes a little independent research and practice.
[0:07:13] <%SuperSunny> apatBig number + fun number
[0:07:15] <%ESP_ROOT> i specifically bought this game to get the big number and dress up my dragon lady
[0:07:17] <Angry_Ev1L> @Lapinelis well then again who doesn't suck at this game Kappa. Community overall skill level is garbage
[0:07:18] <%BlitzNeidhart> @AngriestPat You should probably clarify that's there's a world of difference between normal mode 8 mans and Savage/Extremes
[0:07:20] <+Tsarwerewolf> Hey Pat what do you like on your sandwiches?
[0:07:26] <%TheSniperJoe> @BlitzNeidhart Eh...we'll see, they're changing some stuff but it's the first patch of a new expansion, things will change.
[0:07:26] <@mothmandraws> better than my 10 dudes, you are top ff14 streamer, 3x size of next one
[0:07:27] <$Valdorick> Bitch Odin
[0:07:27] <+clansnevets> Where his head
[0:07:32] <Zereaux> @AngriestPat if there was a little montreal in japan would you move there?
[0:07:34] <%MegboyManuel> @ColRedyx so i wont likely run into that many assholes, is what you're saying
[0:07:37] <@mothmandraws> you are the ninja of ff14
[0:07:46] <$Valdorick> He's a dood-a-hon
[0:07:47] <%TheSniperJoe> I always liked thsi dungeon.
[0:07:48] <TheNocturnalScotsman> dulahan
[0:07:49] <@mothmandraws> hes a dhullahan
[0:07:51] <%Nobrev> he's a dullahan
[0:07:58] <Monkeyweed21> Pat is LITERALLY more popular than Anthem
[0:08:00] <%MegboyManuel> He's Celty
[0:08:01] <Calek> just in case no one has said it, he's a dullahan
[0:08:03] <CybertronPrime> Duel A Han.
[0:08:03] <tealwolf26> Maybe he just has a green screen mask.
[0:08:06] <%Metballs> Always with the STDs NotLikeThis
[0:08:07] <ColRedyx> @MegboyManuel Only if you're really, REALLY bad, and if you care about not being bad, you probably aren't.
[0:08:07] <bestwaifuritsu> lol BLM
[0:08:10] <%Ixiah> cant be, where is his motorcycle ? :P
[0:08:13] <Monkeyweed21> Or die like a bitch
[0:08:14] <+RushUnplugged> there's people that never raid, just fill their days with gathering and crafting, make millions, and then just craft themselves some OP gear and get big number anyway, play the way you like
[0:08:15] <$SleepyMaribo> if your new to aether, dont worry about players who parce, 99% of the time they dont que random duty finder, they have premade static groups so they dont have ot worry aobut us plebs.
[0:08:16] <%Lapinelis> Pat. get some moogle tomes, do praetorium Kappa
[0:08:17] <+Tsarwerewolf> Is he playing black knight?
[0:08:17] <Nemesis2098> Pat bigger than Larryzaur in the ffxiv community
[0:08:17] <%Taisuru> Just had to abandon Orbonne Monastery, it's amazing how many people are completely braindead to TCG's mechanics
[0:08:20] <%allouttajuice> @Monkeyweed21 I mean that's not an achievement, I'm sure astream of a cat's ass would be more popular
[0:08:23] <Supabait> BLM life PepeHands
[0:08:26] <Rhinoprotoss> Is stabbing butts the dps strat?
[0:08:33] <%MegboyManuel> @ColRedyx thanks for the input! Might give it a go now
[0:08:35] <ColRedyx> @MegboyManuel Normal 8-mans are a joke anyway. When people talk about "raiding" they're generally talking about extreme/savage
[0:08:36] <%AFoolishPaper> dps always rear lol
[0:08:36] <@mothmandraws> does ninja have positionals?
[0:08:38] <Temptest666> Hey pat, i just jump potted to a 60 nin today, how fun is the class? think i could like it?
[0:08:39] <tealwolf26> @rhinoprotoss always
[0:08:43] <haisho> @Rhinoprotoss Typically. Some classes need to dance around the butt.
[0:08:52] <bestwaifuritsu> lol the BLM again
[0:08:53] <@mothmandraws> dragoon has butt and side butt
[0:08:53] <ColRedyx> @MegboyManuel If you're worried about normal modes, they're barely much harder than dungeon bosses.
[0:08:54] <@JustinianKnight> uh ok
[0:08:56] <%Ixiah> just like real life
[0:08:57] <@JustinianKnight> no marker
[0:08:59] <%allouttajuice> @haisho specifically monk
[0:08:59] <MC_GigglePants> Sibe butt Kreygasm
[0:09:02] <@JustinianKnight> thats cool
[0:09:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Do the butt stuff.
[0:09:12] <%Octakon910> you think yoshi p is still fuming over that live letter?
[0:09:12] <alamorn> Also you dont want to get cleaved
[0:09:13] <Angry_Ev1L> @Temptest666 be ready to be a TA bitch for life
[0:09:14] <TioXyco> butt pierce
[0:09:17] <Fuji_Apples> Target: Butt
[0:09:18] <Anubis> ninja has 3 positionals, Aerolian edge and trick attack at rear, Armor crush at flanks @mothmandraws
[0:09:22] <@mothmandraws> full thrust the butt
[0:09:24] <%marsano168> I like MCH cause I just sit back and fire away
[0:09:26] <haisho> @allouttajuice Don't remind me. I regret starting Lancer but I'm determined to go through with it.
[0:09:27] <+RushUnplugged> melee dps have positionals, also you want to be on the opposite side of the tank
[0:09:27] <%Taisuru> Next expansion is FFXIV : Buttslappers
[0:09:28] <Monkeyweed21> Samurai has very little butt dancing
[0:09:28] <%FreyRune> classic melee dps problems, positions
[0:09:28] <%AFoolishPaper> SAM doesnt get positionals til like 52
[0:09:29] <+Azarian1> Or you could be a super cool BLM and never fucking move and just throw Plasma
[0:09:29] <jimmytwofeet> VoHiYo
[0:09:30] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat don't forget that the butt and side have a higher chance to be hit
[0:09:32] <zamzoph> the optimal Dark Souls boss-fighting position
[0:09:33] <%MegboyManuel> @ColRedyx gotcha pokuriHYPE
[0:09:33] <+Tsarwerewolf> So whats the meta comp here? 1 tank 2dps 1 healer? @AngriestPat
[0:09:36] <Zepik> yoshi P is too exhausted to even remember the live letter
[0:09:36] <Bad1uck> @Rhinoprotoss Monsters also cannot parry attacks from behind, so you will always end up doing more damage no matter the skill
[0:09:37] <+KoyaMusa> ALSO most bosses do frontal cleaves so staying in their ass is usually the safest bet
[0:09:47] <%MegboyManuel> Always spank the boss
[0:09:49] <+Ell1ot> do you have to roll for loot?
[0:09:51] <@mothmandraws> meta of ff14 is - mothman + 3 randos
[0:09:54] <haveswordmuststing> Full Thrust the butt, AND Jump into it Kappa
[0:09:56] <%spiritofmojave> butt is my favorite place as Monk
[0:10:06] <%GarbageNirvana> 15 dps
[0:10:06] <%Taisuru> 6 heal
[0:10:07] <%BlitzNeidhart> @AngriestPat Chance to hit was removed 2 years ago
[0:10:08] <%Divryne> 6 heals.
[0:10:16] <%AFoolishPaper> {Full Thrust} {Rear}
[0:10:18] <%MegboyManuel> MOTH MEN
[0:10:24] <Angry_Ev1L> 4 tanks is meta Kappa always
[0:10:26] <alrobot2014> only 3 tanks? that sounds like a lot of pressure
[0:10:27] <Monkeyweed21> Accuracy is gone dingus
[0:10:30] <Supabait> which is why tanks and healers actually get to level fast, low to no queue times
[0:10:33] <%sshen> Meta for EX Rath is 4 tanks only
[0:10:34] <+Fynale> the first 24 man had 6 tanks but it never really needed them
[0:10:36] <+clansnevets> Have a good fun, Pat!
[0:10:37] <%Metballs> It's usually 2 more tanks than are needed
[0:10:41] <%MegboyManuel> @alrobot2014 only 1 tank holds all the aggro too
[0:10:42] <+Fynale> so they made the rest 3 tanks
[0:10:47] <alamorn> You should show off something cool like Shinryu
[0:10:48] <Monkeyweed21> Not really
[0:10:48] <Angry_Ev1L> @alrobot2014 it really is not . 24 men raids aren't exactly hardcore content
[0:10:49] <$Valdorick> 4 Warriors? That bitch strats… gotta go OG - 4 White Mages Kappa
[0:10:51] <Nemesis2098> metacomp: 1 paladin 3 warriors
[0:10:52] <alrobot2014> ah
[0:10:53] <%FreyRune> 4 tanks in rathalos extreme is the best
[0:10:54] <MiskatonicAlum> with the original 24 man, they just found dumb things to make the extra tanks do
[0:10:55] <+Tsarwerewolf> The closest thing to an mmo I am in is Warframe
[0:10:57] <+StrawberryPantsu> {Miasma III} all {Lalafell}
[0:10:59] <MiskatonicAlum> like click nodes and shit
[0:11:00] <%Nobrev> with 6 healers you only need 3 tanks
[0:11:02] <%allouttajuice> @Supabait probably gonna be a healer favored que at the start of ShB then everyone returns to mains and the numbers normalize again
[0:11:05] <+Tsarwerewolf> But this looks taxing early on
[0:11:14] <@mothmandraws> pat if you could add any races to ff14 what would they be, id like rat ppl from ff9. Think a few more beast races might help, listened to a podcast where they mentioned alot of wow players being happy ronso is being added as they dont like cute animu
[0:11:16] <%BlitzNeidhart> @AngriestPat Accuracy vanished with Stormblood you doofus
[0:11:19] <ColRedyx> Basically Ninja makes other players look better.
[0:11:21] <%ESP_ROOT> F ?
[0:11:22] <bestwaifuritsu> Every 60 seconds you are needed for 10 seconds LUL
[0:11:22] <%Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[0:11:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 42m.
[0:11:33] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat ninja might not be as needed as it's losing a lot of the reasons outside of trick attack that ninja was needed
[0:11:35] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat you ready for all comps to force ninja/dancer for ultimate buff?
[0:11:44] <SarahTsang> @AngriestPat hai hai
[0:11:45] <Angry_Ev1L> @mothmandraws we already have potatoes we don;t need any more rat people Kappa
[0:11:45] <Kekon3> used to be the best skill in the game because all burst windows were at the trick window
[0:11:49] <+StrawberryPantsu> DRG and NIN still best bois
[0:11:51] <%Darthwaffler> Naughty Treant
[0:11:52] <tealwolf26> LOTRO was my last mmo. Don't have the time to rush to cap anymore.
[0:11:54] <@mothmandraws> burmeciens are cool
[0:11:57] <ThatDangSkeleton> I'm excited for shb but I'm honestly worried I won't have time to get caught up on everything in time. I basically just got to Heavensward
[0:11:59] <%ESP_ROOT> my computer shat itself as he was explaining NotLikeThis
[0:12:03] <+StrawberryPantsu> MNK helps healers though
[0:12:03] <alamorn> accuracy depend on your level relative to the thing you are hitting
[0:12:05] <Monkeyweed21> NIN/DNC/BRD/MNK?
[0:12:15] <$Valdorick> Why are there no Burmeciens outside of FF9!? ARE THEY TOO COOL FOR YOU, SQUARE!?
[0:12:15] <%BlitzNeidhart> @Kekon3 Still is, and still looks to be in Shadowbringers
[0:12:17] <%AFoolishPaper> i would've loved burmecians as a race option tbh
[0:12:18] <@Velyndra> NIN/DNC/MCH/DRG
[0:12:19] <$Tuskor13> The best DPS mechanics are the ones that let non DPS types do big numbers
[0:12:26] <@Velyndra> assuming MCH is decent
[0:12:29] <pandangerous> pour one out for tornado kick FeelsBadMan
[0:12:38] <alamorn> If youre lvl 50 and try to hit lvl 70 you can still miss
[0:12:38] <+Tsarwerewolf> Hey what class or job is Pat playing?
[0:12:39] <Angry_Ev1L> @ThatDangSkeleton It is doable but it'll be hard. You basically can blew through hw and sb in 1 week if you play long enough
[0:12:40] <count_bob> Oh no, Pat's a Naruto now.
[0:12:45] <Monkeyweed21> Replace DRG for SMN for the off healers
[0:12:46] <%spiritofmojave> I wish they upped Brotherhood bonus for ShB jermaPluto
[0:12:49] <@mothmandraws> the best dps numbers are the number of friends you made along the way
[0:12:49] <%FreyRune> @ThatDangSkeleton honestly take your time, Heavensward is the best expansion out of the three. enjoy it
[0:12:49] <Temptest666> Oh also, you may wanna let people know if you havent already. Jump potions are discounted right now for almost all classes to 17.50 right now
[0:12:52] <+Tsarwerewolf> Is he tanking or?
[0:12:54] <%Fidranth> Tornado Kick? Good riddance
[0:12:58] <Monkeyweed21> Tornado Kick NEEDS a buff
[0:12:59] <%allouttajuice> @Velyndra I'd assuyme brd over mch for rdps buff, idk if drg is necessary anymore since debuffs are being removed
[0:13:00] <@Velyndra> jump potions ruin the game
[0:13:01] <bestwaifuritsu> thank god theyre getting rid of resistances
[0:13:01] <%Kaask> tornado kick isnt the blunt debuff pat. thats dragon kick.
[0:13:06] <%sshen> Gibe cannoners race
[0:13:07] <Monkeyweed21> It's still ok
[0:13:10] <r_Foeburden87> Watching Pat Stream while my own story roulette goes.
[0:13:15] <%Kaask> also as a monk for life, i hate tornado kick.
[0:13:20] <Monkeyweed21> Both kick moves are still in Pat
[0:13:21] <xmetalicdemonx> As a tank when taking on a boss and they summon minions to attack do you stick to the boss or leave to protect the party until everything is dead?
[0:13:21] <%Taisuru> It's not
[0:13:26] <%Taisuru> Please uninstall pat
[0:13:28] <%BlitzNeidhart> That's not what Tornado Kick is Pat, Dragon Kick is blunt down
[0:13:30] <+Risingxiv> bunny of shame
[0:13:32] <@Velyndra> @allouttajuice with the way that DNC and AST are, its still debatable if raid wide DPS is better, or pushing buffs onto one target for big DPS
[0:13:33] <Angry_Ev1L> somebody parse pat and expose his lvl 50 ninja dps Kappa
[0:13:40] <$Valdorick> Goblins are lame - add the Dwarves from FF9... Hell, just add FF9!
[0:13:42] <%AFoolishPaper> protip: hide your mudras in the enemy so nobody can tell you messed up
[0:13:52] <krymzen5> THE BAD
[0:13:54] <$Valdorick> Dear Square - FF9, just FF9
[0:13:56] <bestwaifuritsu> @Valdorick dwarves are in shadowbringers
[0:13:59] <+Tsarwerewolf> Sounds like the mods are pretty active on this game
[0:14:03] <%Taisuru> at weren't you JUST saying how much all bad players should be banned :P
[0:14:03] <Angry_Ev1L> Yeah so do not mention parse just tell them they're fucking bad and do not play properly Kappa
[0:14:07] <$Valdorick> 10/10! BEST GAME!
[0:14:07] <$SleepyMaribo> @xmetalicdemonx normall you use your long range enmity move to pull them to you while keep ign the boss in place
[0:14:08] <Monkeyweed21> NO IT'S NOT
[0:14:09] <@Velyndra> @allouttajuice but if that is the case that its not better, then it'll be more likely for DNC/SMN/NIN/MNK
[0:14:10] <bestwaifuritsu> as lalafells LUL
[0:14:11] <Basch71> Tornado Kick's the move that uses all the grease lightnings
[0:14:12] <%ZombehTaco879> there are mods but shhhh\
[0:14:13] <pandangerous> playing around tornado kick and the ways to regain GL are what made me love monk
[0:14:13] <%Kaask> but truly, i hate the current stance dancing to TK every 30 seconds with wind tackle back to fire tackle. it was great they actually made tackle mastery good and revolutionized the opener and rotation, but stance dancing needs to die.
[0:14:14] <CrimsonGargoyle> don't harrass people period LUL
[0:14:17] <@mothmandraws> wish the mods were more active, ive reported like 12 gold farmers today
[0:14:22] <+Ell1ot> i don't like it when people keep telling me about my bad without telling me how to improve myself
[0:14:25] <%Mythicalbrit> But you can still go "WHY ARE YOU SO BAD STOP GETTING HIT BY THE AOES YOU BAD" and that doesnt get you banned for some reason its really fucking weird
[0:14:25] <%allouttajuice> @Velyndra Ah, yeah I can see why then
[0:14:26] <%Fidranth> I hate tornado kick because it's animation is underwhelming for the amount of damage it does
[0:14:29] <+Azarian1> @AngriestPat But Pat, I'm a ice mage. I have to role play my character right.
[0:14:31] <%marsano168> Its what discords are for!
[0:14:32] <%ESP_ROOT> im bad FeelsBadMan
[0:14:33] <Monkeyweed21> Why does Pat talk so confidently about a class he's too coward to play
[0:14:34] <Angry_Ev1L> DO NOT HARASS them just fucking KICK them for harassment Kappa
[0:14:36] <alamorn> try to help them first
[0:14:37] <%allouttajuice> @Velyndra honestly I just want GNB to be decent
[0:14:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Treebeard, nooooooo!
[0:14:40] <%Nobrev> when someone is having trouble be helpful, not toxic
[0:14:41] <@mothmandraws> was watching like 12 dudes in blue robes pop in and out of uldah
[0:14:44] <ColRedyx> @mothmandraws The bans happens in waves.
[0:14:45] <+Estuko> @mothmandraws I haven't heard of gold farmers since Runescape in middleschool
[0:14:46] <%allouttajuice> Everything else is secondary for me lol
[0:14:47] <+Tsarwerewolf> @mothmandraws how long is the ban for that? Perma hopefully
[0:14:48] <+BloodBladexX> What server are you on Pat? : )
[0:14:50] <tealwolf26> A client side utility only might be better
[0:14:51] <haisho> Gold farmers come in waves and leave in waves
[0:14:52] <%Cthulos> @angriestpat My subscription killed your internet, lol. I was wondering if you could tell me what mage class you would suggest if you like slowing, debuffing and sapping enemies while kiting them in FF14? I have to say that I like Red Mage in Tactics Advance and want to play a Viera when the expansion drops
[0:14:56] <%FreyRune> @AngriestPat you know about the ffxiv jail where bad players get sent to a secret room with a GM waiting inside?
[0:15:00] <%Fidranth> apatGoblin
[0:15:01] <%MyDarkStorm> You Mean the RMT People
[0:15:02] <+Rivalsz> hey buddies
[0:15:04] <bestwaifuritsu> Monkey trouble
[0:15:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Orcs! Destroyers usurpers CURSE THEM
[0:15:05] <@mothmandraws> was funny as they had set uniforms, then a different bot clan in red hats showed up
[0:15:09] <$Valdorick> It is... the literal… boogyman.
[0:15:09] <%TheSniperJoe> My wife used to be on the mod team during 2.0, they're pretty hard workers but the team is pretty small.
[0:15:10] <@mothmandraws> rival bot companies
[0:15:10] <Rotharn> Pat, why don't you parse? Could you be banned for streaming with a parsing overlay?
[0:15:12] <Nemesis2098> Been seeing like 3 trains of 20 blm farm bots htese passed few weeks
[0:15:14] <haisho> @Cthulos Definitely not Black Mage.
[0:15:16] <Monkeyweed21> Why does pat shittalk a job he's too coward to play
[0:15:16] <@Velyndra> @allouttajuice ATM they're ok, but i personally expect a potency change for them, possible increase
[0:15:21] <%ESP_ROOT> Boogyman monkaS
[0:15:21] <%Octakon910> good players at one point were also bad
[0:15:23] <%BlitzNeidhart> @Cthulos There's really no class like that in XIV
[0:15:25] <@mothmandraws> because pat doesnt want us to see his numbers
[0:15:27] <KVD22> fucking INVISIBLESSED
[0:15:31] <@mothmandraws> negative dps
[0:15:31] <alamorn> Hes comin to getchu
[0:15:34] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat why did you kill Treebeard, are you in league with Saruman?
[0:15:36] <Swish19XX> I had a DRK run a instance and not use a single ability. I took the 30 min hit. I'm not healing that bullshit
[0:15:37] <@Velyndra> @Rotharn no, you probably won't get banned for parsing on stream. Raiders do it a lot. Hes just leveling, no need to parse
[0:15:38] <%allouttajuice> @Velyndra I hope they get some better potency and that superbolide isn't just a worst hallowed grounds on launch
[0:15:48] <Monkeyweed21> Pat is doing -750 dps
[0:15:51] <ColRedyx> @Mythicalbrit Because they can't really ban criticism. They have parsers against the ToS on the books as an excuse to ban people who use them to bully, but criticism has to cross the line to actual harassment to get banned otherwise.
[0:15:52] <Angry_Ev1L> @mothmandraws when I got to HW YEARS AGO motherfucking BOT TRAINS were running around. Like 10 fukcing bots in a line going sonicfast LUL good times
[0:15:58] <pandangerous> LUL
[0:16:05] <+Tsarwerewolf> God theres so much on the screen at once
[0:16:06] <sumire_gelato> what if I have no friends so I mine ore til I can buy a mansion
[0:16:07] <@Velyndra> @allouttajuice It will be, but hopefully that will be to "offset" its other skills getting buffed
[0:16:07] <+Vostroyan1> pat is actively healing the boss with his dps
[0:16:10] <$Valdorick> @mothmandraws From a business stand point, it makes sense. Don't want the mark to accidently trade with the wrong bot, that's money outta your pocket, and free money for your competition!
[0:16:13] <bestwaifuritsu> @AngriestPat after the light pops you get a buff that explodes when it wears off and reveals him if you catch him in the aoe
[0:16:23] <Monkeyweed21> Pat is doing DPS to his PARTY
[0:16:28] <%ESP_ROOT> Twoggyman
[0:16:37] <@mothmandraws> pat is the raid boss
[0:16:45] <tealwolf26> @tsarwerewolf yup good ol MMO UI and particle effects
[0:16:48] <$KwakuAnansi> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, what's your opinion of FF14 Mentor system and if can what would you change about it?
[0:16:49] <%allouttajuice> @Velyndra yeah that does make sense, still it just is annoying to have to wait and see what it's like on release and wait for possible hotfixes. I just want to weab out AND be decent lol
[0:16:49] <Rotharn> @Velyndra I think parsing while leveling is important, helps you get instant feedback on your performance while you're learning a class
[0:16:56] <+Estuko> NotLikeThis from hometown bogeyman took the children away to some nightmare place, he doesn't do anything for them since he's just a punisher of children lol, still scared me
[0:16:58] <haisho> That is a -50 DLP
[0:17:02] <%Fidranth> alternate mode where I can play as the raid boss vs an 8 man group
[0:17:09] <Rotharn> But for comfy leveling, I get not wanting it
[0:17:10] <%allouttajuice> That is a 50 DKP MINUS
[0:17:13] <%elxinon> @AngriestPat What are your thoughts on the new classes being released with the upcoming expansion?
[0:17:16] <@mothmandraws> more dots
[0:17:20] <%allouttajuice> more dots
[0:17:22] <%allouttajuice> stop dots
[0:17:26] <+tundraSB> Pat are you still on ultros
[0:17:29] <%ESP_ROOT> dots ...
[0:17:32] <Angry_Ev1L> @Mythicalbrit lol mb standing in AOEs like an idiot should get you banned to. Banned for bad... actually pat wanted something like that last stream Kappa
[0:17:32] <mr_hunter> Many whelps handle it
[0:17:34] <Monkeyweed21> Pat doton is the second worst jutsu
[0:17:35] <@Velyndra> @allouttajuice agreed, but it seems like overall it'll be a minor loss if anything. Only an issue at super top level plays. It'll be good
[0:17:39] <+TheUberknife> hit it very hard and very fast
[0:17:41] <x3as> WHO THE FUCK

[0:17:58] <+Tsarwerewolf> This the last part of the dungeon>?
[0:18:01] <@Velyndra> @Rotharn his DPS will change the moment he levels, or changes gear. It won't mean anything aside from letting you guys go "LAWL GET GOOD"
[0:18:02] <%Verd_254> that video is the best
[0:18:02] <%allouttajuice> @Velyndra yeah, side note, I need to figure out the Dante glamour. GNB is just asking to be Dante lol
[0:18:03] <%Fidranth> DPS check, the fight
[0:18:03] <ittla> @AngriestPat explain what a DPS check is
[0:18:04] <InfiniteSwagbito> Embrace the Naruto, Pat.
[0:18:04] <Monkeyweed21> Pat's DPS is banning people
[0:18:07] <Calek> best part about Raids are bosses who get 2 rows of debuffs and DoTs
[0:18:10] <BinaryShuffle> MANY whelps

[0:18:21] <@Velyndra> @allouttajuice if you did it, noctus's gear is good
[0:18:21] <+Estuko> Void Syrup goes AMAZING with voidcakes
[0:18:25] <%marsano168> You don't really need parseing persay. generally if you ask questions even in game folks are nice enough with tips
[0:18:34] <$Valdorick> Kill 'em before the wall master reaches shit
[0:18:41] <ColRedyx> It's basically a damage drag race.
[0:18:45] <%allouttajuice> @Velyndra I haven't played since 2.x, followed the game but with GNB coming I have a reason to come back in 5.0 lol
[0:18:47] <%ESP_ROOT> monkaS
[0:18:48] <ColRedyx> Do X damage in Y seconds.
[0:18:58] <Angry_Ev1L> DPS check means if you're shit at DPS you won't kill shit you need fast enough. And how would we know who is the shittiest dps? You called it - parser Kappa
[0:19:01] <Basch71> plus its spooky too
[0:19:02] <Rotharn> @Velyndra Ye, I totally understand why not to broadcast your numerical performance to a critical audience
[0:19:06] <%FreyRune> @AngriestPat what's your favourite 24 man raid?
[0:19:09] <tealwolf26> Maybe I'm not weeb enough but I don't enjoy a laser light show covering my screen while I try to fight. I'd rather just raw animations with no glowy glowy and a crisp ui.
[0:19:13] <Monkeyweed21> does that mean Pat is going to wipe?
[0:19:25] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan don't think I can be reliable enough in these sorta games, I'm a slow strategy/support type lass
[0:19:32] <%Mythicalbrit> you can do that in settings @tealwolf26
[0:19:34] <BusterWoIf> Hey Pat, Did you finish O9S?
[0:19:36] <Kekon3> until you hit the of level content, you can regularly cheese the DPS checks by overleveling/gearing
[0:19:37] <Calek> @Estuko be a healer
[0:19:37] <%ZombehTaco879> apatBig DPS
[0:19:40] <%ESP_ROOT> @Estuko try playing healer?
[0:19:45] <tealwolf26> @mythicalbrit fair point
[0:19:48] <+Zepshire> or Bard
[0:19:49] <+Estuko> @ESP_ROOT @Calek o
[0:19:49] <+TheUberknife> odds groups go to left even groups go to right
[0:19:54] <bestwaifuritsu> do combo
[0:19:58] <Basch71> the next boss I tanked a few days ago, straight up lost half my life cuz it decided to tankbuster me and auto'd at the same time
[0:20:00] <%Mythicalbrit> like I get not liking it but thats not a complaint when its optional right
[0:20:06] <%AFoolishPaper> dots when
[0:20:10] <CurrySauseBandit> @Estuko Healing in this game has some of the lowest required healing in most MMO's LUL Yo'll be fine.
[0:20:10] <+dandara_> Just do damage 4Head
[0:20:12] <%allouttajuice> Everyone to the center, and whatever you do don't stand next to other people
[0:20:14] <%marsano168> evil BEES
[0:20:20] <InfiniteSwagbito> Shoot the bloodlapper until it dies
[0:20:30] <Kekon3> Starter on DOT and refresh every 4 combos

[0:20:34] <bestwaifuritsu> Ferdiad mah boy
[0:20:36] <+Estuko> @CurrySauseBandit really?? I'm used to getting yelled at if a person's hp dropped below 75% in some games... ;;;
[0:20:40] <ColRedyx> @Estuko You could try White Mage. It's a pretty straightforward healer with a simple damage rotation. Or if you're good at planning and remembering patterns, Scholar is less demanding on reaction time and more on preparation.
[0:20:41] <@mothmandraws> patgod
[0:20:43] <%FreyRune> GOAD PLS

[0:21:01] <+Estuko> @InfiniteSwagbito @haisho EYY
[0:21:01] <@Velyndra> @Estuko healing in this game is, for the most part, "don't let them die, do the mechanics"
[0:21:04] <%allouttajuice> @Estuko healer mantra of this game is "did you die? No? Good"

[0:21:22] <Angry_Ev1L> @Estuko oof I would not like healer who overheal even in dungeons in FF14. Tho this people exist and this sucks
[0:21:25] <alamorn> Do you have hide yet?
[0:21:29] <CurrySauseBandit> @Estuko I know the feel. You'll stil get those moments, when people facetank like they're blindfolded. Otherwise it's super easy to heal here, so long as you read tooltips.
[0:21:29] <%Laecerelius> I need to do void ark at some point

[0:21:53] <ColRedyx> @Estuko That's because healer DPS is worthless in those games. Here you'll be yelled out if you try to keep everyone at 100% at all times. Throw out DPS until people need the heals, heal, then go back. Healer DPS will all be extremely simple in Shadowbringers too, just 3 spells.
[0:21:57] <$Valdorick> The world, revolving.
[0:21:58] <Monkeyweed21> Do the NART
[0:21:59] <haisho> How can you call yourself a DPS if you're doing 0 damage?!

[0:22:15] <RyloStar> healers who don't DPS are so lazy
[0:22:16] <+Estuko> @chat ty ty for advice, I'll have to peek at the game sometime, does it require a lot of dedication? or can I just play a good 30 min to 2 hrs prob and be happy for every other day?
[0:22:18] <Serge_12> cashDerp
[0:22:29] <Basch71> his autos kinda hurt even at this level
[0:22:35] <+Estuko> @ColRedyx ahhh that sounds nice
[0:22:40] <InfiniteSwagbito> That was close
[0:22:43] <%ESP_ROOT> monkaS
[0:22:46] <%LegendCobra> thats so slow
[0:22:47] <@Velyndra> @Estuko you can super play casual. just do the MSQ. Yoshi p even says that its fine if you just unsub between patches if thats what you want
[0:22:49] <%ESP_ROOT> the goo
[0:22:51] <Fuji_Apples> I always thought Joker Reaper was cool
[0:22:53] <@mothmandraws> that was a long ass wind up wtf
[0:22:55] <ColRedyx> @Estuko You can absolutely take your time with it if you don't care about the high-end stuff.
[0:22:58] <%marsano168> @Estuko thats basically the exact gameplay loop thats encouraged so you are good
[0:23:00] <pandangerous> shameful transpose FeelsBadMan
[0:23:00] <Supabait> is this jester from DMC3? 🤔
[0:23:01] <%Metballs> There's nothing to heal in this game. Even in Savage fights are so scripted that you're sitting around without needing to heal for so long.
[0:23:02] <%ESP_ROOT> i thought that said Troubledaddy
[0:23:06] <@Velyndra> @Estuko A lot of people only do the story. Its good, take your time, take it slow
[0:23:11] <InfiniteSwagbito> The slowest spell cast goddamn
[0:23:18] <%LegendCobra> lmao thats so lenient
[0:23:26] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> This was a lot closer when it came out
[0:23:28] <Kekon3> They really give you time to clear these DPS checks
[0:23:29] <@mothmandraws> I could fit 2 dragoon jumps in there
[0:23:32] <Calek> you only need to heal in this game if people screw up or there's an AoE attack
[0:23:45] <%allouttajuice> god I remember these fights being way more difficult
[0:23:45] <Angry_Ev1L> yeah I remember times when ARR dungeons were challenging

[0:24:43] <Kodpol> @AngriestPat Did you ever play Star Wars Galaxies or Everquest?
[0:24:46] <Dastardry> Did Pat seriously just delete a card instead of turning it in for mgp?
[0:24:51] <ColRedyx> @Estuko Fair warning though, occasionally the healing can get tough with tanks that want to do big dungeon pulls. Just focus on healing them until most of the pull is dead. Nobody will care that you don't DPS during huge pulls, the tanks can die fast. That will be the most intense thing you have to deal with if you don't raid.
[0:24:52] <Angry_Ev1L> @RyloStar cause they compared difficulty to a skill level of an average player Kappa

[0:28:45] <+miguelrod777> she's ok
[0:28:45] <TioXyco> @AngriestPat question: linking glamour plates to job sets does what exactly?
[0:28:45] <BeefyQueefer> she's never going to sleep with you, soyboy
[0:28:46] <bestwaifuritsu> the weapon and armor need twine, the accessories need coat
[0:28:47] <%demegodz> Thats gay pat
[0:28:48] <Kekon3> SourPls
[0:28:50] <haisho> is it Fellgourd? I know I bumped into Masterworks crafter when I started

[0:28:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[0:28:56] <+RhymesWithWasabi> lol this shinryu dog

[0:29:20] <TioXyco> Oooooooooh
[0:29:21] <ASleepySnek> its rad af
[0:29:29] <Tomschiii> wow thats great
[0:29:29] <haisho> yeah this place
[0:29:30] <+Shockrates20XX> So you can set a glamour at a lower level and always have that look even if you upgrade gear?
[0:29:34] <ColRedyx> Basically saying "when I put on this set I want this glamour, no matter what's in the set"
[0:29:37] <CountMeowingtonn> I've decided to get the sam to level 60 to begin my journey into weeb land appropriately
[0:29:48] <Tucker0603> CRAZY TALK
[0:29:51] <+blackkanye> I don't even know how glamour plates work
[0:29:53] <ColRedyx> @Shockrates20XX Yeah basically. It saves you the work of reapplying the plate manually.
[0:30:02] <TioXyco> when you change in city estates, it auto glamours your equips
[0:30:08] <GypsySquid> It also makes it so that you don't have to spent Glamour Prisms each time you wanna change vanity sets.
[0:30:09] <+Dee_Jay> I wish shb will allow you to apply plates everywhere
[0:30:09] <+blackkanye> Does it take something everytime?
[0:30:15] <bestwaifuritsu> @CountMeowingtonn you'll love it, the 70 quest is weeb as hell
[0:30:20] <tealwolf26> I <3 cosmetic gear. Fashion souls is the best.
[0:30:21] <+tundraSB> carbotwine
[0:30:24] <ColRedyx> @blackkanye A glamour plate is basically a saved set of glamours (transmogs) for your entire body.
[0:30:26] <%Typhaeon> Hey it's Gerolt of Rovia
[0:30:44] <+ZGoten> DRK is physically incapable of holding 2 knives.
[0:30:45] <Kekon3> But Pat, you can't equip it RIGHT NOW,
[0:30:46] <+blackkanye> @ColRedyx I know that. I mean like how you use them
[0:30:47] <%spiritofmojave> Gary from NVIDIA jermaVenus
[0:30:57] <+BloodBladexX> What server does pat play on?
[0:30:58] <Dastardry> Just right click on the item request instead of going through your inventory.
[0:30:59] <pandangerous> you can just press square on the slot instead of manually finding it in your inventory
[0:31:00] <Bielzitcho> pat, try pressing the square button when you're at the "item request" window
[0:31:01] <ColRedyx> @blackkanye Adding a piece of gear to the glamour dresser so it can be used in plates costs one glamour prisms per piece, but editing and applying the plates costs nothing.
[0:31:02] <Fuji_Apples> provide you with relic video cards
[0:31:17] <+Ell1ot> the game showed me a glamour tutorial and now my low level gear looks like the starting gear
[0:31:19] <%TheShal> But the stats tho
[0:31:23] <ColRedyx> @blackkanye To manually apply a set you just open the glamour plate menu on the equipment screen, pick a set, and click "apply"
[0:31:23] <%Metballs> Square auto-fills those slots, btw
[0:31:25] <thegreenbenis> HEY PAT
[0:31:27] <darkdivison> @angriestpat Can I glamour my gear to look like gear from other classes?
[0:31:29] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat if you press square on the required items list it will auto fill for you
[0:31:35] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat can't you use square on trade ins and quest turn ins to auto pull items from inventory
[0:31:38] <+Qits> I hate how recommended will ignore armor in the inventory.
[0:31:39] <CountMeowingtonn> I've decided to get the sam to level 60 to begin my journey into weeb land appropriately
[0:31:39] <Kekon3> Pat pls, your inventory
[0:31:46] <+tundraSB> lol
[0:31:47] <+Ell1ot> make him pink
[0:31:47] <Angry_Ev1L> Just use jet black what the fuck you're doing
[0:31:47] <%TheShal> Go Jet black
[0:31:56] <mr_hunter> burple
[0:31:56] <TheEvilOmega> Go green and purple.
[0:31:57] <+KnightsoftheOnion> looks blue
[0:31:58] <%TombstoneTTromboners> purple good
[0:31:58] <+Ell1ot> are you sure it isn't blue?
[0:31:59] <thegreenbenis> IT'S BLUE.
[0:31:59] <%Laecerelius> Or is it blue?
[0:31:59] <BourneWarrior> Red like Ermac
[0:31:59] <MrMysteryMask> navy bue
[0:32:03] <+blackkanye> @ColRedyx would it manually apply it after I 'set' it?
[0:32:04] <$Valdorick> tHAT IS A BAD PURPLE.
[0:32:05] <Dastardry> Ironworks dyes like complete shit
[0:32:05] <thegreenbenis> THAT'S PURPLE PAT
[0:32:07] <%ecolli37108> ink blue is my favorite
[0:32:08] <%TheShal> Rolanberry Red!!
[0:32:10] <$Valdorick> And that is caps lock
[0:32:11] <+Estuko> -is colour blind- IT LOOKS GREAT
[0:32:12] <%Typhaeon> I hate how the cloth materials take dyes
[0:32:12] <BeefyQueefer> pink, you coward
[0:32:13] <thegreenbenis> That's blue pat.
[0:32:18] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> ink blue's pretty good for a store-bought dye
[0:32:19] <+MisterCrimson> do green out of respect to Reptile
[0:32:21] <Kekon3> Dude, I don't fuck with Ironworks unless its SAM
[0:32:22] <A_Red_Robot> None of the Ironworks stuff dyes all that well
[0:32:23] <%Typhaeon> Leather and metal are so mcuh better
[0:32:25] <burntwing> The Black and white actually looks pretty awesome i think
[0:32:26] <garbageheaphound> such is the life of Pat

[0:33:57] <+Ell1ot> why do you have green fart gas on your dog?
[0:33:57] <ColRedyx> @blackkanye Well you create the plate and either manually apply it through the menu, or associate it with a gearset so it applies automatically whenever you equip that set.
[0:33:58] <Angry_Ev1L> I lost faith in FF14 armor design long ago LUL Basically if you're not drg or a tank you're fucked 99% of a time

[0:43:16] <commsquirrel> Can't back down now pat
[0:43:24] <ColRedyx> @nemesis2098 Sounds like a Windows problem more than FF14 problem. Try googling your controller and OS version and read some support threads for ideas.
[0:43:27] <%ESP_ROOT> stormbloods main theme is so good BibleThump 7

[0:43:45] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat what do you think about the Wolfliege set?
[0:43:47] <+Brighthawk> Thanks for the FF14 streams. We may be on different data centers but this is good enough
[0:43:47] <%allouttajuice> @AngriestPat so are you considering swapping to GNB at all or leaving that for after you finish shit major content as a DRK?
[0:43:49] <jackythefrost> Black Mage tho
[0:43:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Punch-gang Kreygasm
[0:43:49] <Nemesis2098> ps4 with ds4. Ive run through the normal stuff but it only happens with ffxiv
[0:43:52] <TioXyco> Play as bard. you played melee dps already : D
[0:43:53] <+phamchri> wat levels are ur other classes pat?
[0:43:57] <AdmiralButtloaf> you should do sigmascape 1.0
[0:43:58] <@mothmandraws> I think if you are doing 24 hours there is an agreement that "the streamer probably wont talk constantly"
[0:43:59] <%TombstoneTTromboners> eureka wasn't future proofed at all
[0:44:00] <+RushUnplugged> Eureka drove me off the game, I despise it
[0:44:06] <%TheShal> Eureka has been nerfed a bit. It's not that bad. Even Pagos is kinda doable
[0:44:08] <%FreyRune> yeah but do you have the BIG DOG?
[0:44:10] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat What races (+gender) do you feel there are too many or too few in population? I heard potatoes are everywhere in Japan
[0:44:13] <Bad1uck> @Nemesis2098 I use a USB 360 controller as well, but you can use whatever you want like a PS4

[0:57:26] <haveswordmuststing> hello my fellow Ninjas
[0:57:28] <%AquilaHarukaze> I just realized where he's about to go
[0:57:30] <tealwolf26> oh no! three wolves now
[0:57:31] <DRAGKUDO> Mia khalifa?! DansGame
[0:57:35] <%FreyRune> @angriestpat what is your favourite job questline and why is it Dark knight?
[0:57:39] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat Is it crazy to you that XI still gets updated with new content?
[0:58:02] <@ThePlotHole> DRK and SMN are my 2 favorites
[0:58:03] <Bad1uck> Wait it DOES?
[0:58:05] <%Divryne> That's a PRETTY good description.
[0:58:07] <@mothmandraws> lancer one was wierd
[0:58:09] <%TheSniperJoe> Yep.
[0:58:10] <jackythefrost> Yes
[0:58:12] <Kekon3> Yes it does
[0:58:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Well
[0:58:15] <LandOfTheWay> i don't even play DRK and i know it's the best job questline
[0:58:15] <@mothmandraws> they love courage
[0:58:17] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat are people overhyping DRK questline or is it really that good?
[0:58:18] <zamzoph> What does?
[0:58:19] <Kekon3> DRG acts like its canon
[0:58:19] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah it's worthwhile
[0:58:20] <ShichiNoBushi> Other than random grunts?
[0:58:20] <Latija> spoilers lol
[0:58:22] <%TheSniperJoe> I cannot understate how AWESOME Dark Knight's questline is.
[0:58:22] <alamorn> FRAY IS SO COOL
[0:58:23] <Tucker0603> as a Paladin main....Dark Knight is fucking rad
[0:58:23] <%Nobrev> in a way it does
[0:58:24] <Kekon3> but we all know its DRK
[0:58:27] <haisho> oh god I'm not looking forward to that. I rolled a potato because Potato Dragoon sounded hilarious...but they have terrible voice choices
[0:58:29] <NoirePanzer> DRK questline has a super pissy WoL and it's great
[0:58:30] <chris_babaganoosh05> I wish Fray was my dad
[0:58:30] <bestwaifuritsu> Fray is a fucking bro
[0:58:36] <%Cthulos> A voice!? HoLy SHEEEIIIIiiiiit
[0:58:38] <Angry_Ev1L> potato personality
[0:58:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> I am thou....
[0:58:45] <Bad1uck> Oh shit RIGHT, you talk to yourself!
[0:58:45] <+RushUnplugged> the WoL is VERY tired of your bullshit
[0:58:47] <Fuji_Apples> FRAY
[0:58:49] <%TheSniperJoe> The lady who wrote them is like, the main scenario writer now.
[0:58:50] <%Divryne> And the writer for that is writing Shadowbringers.
[0:58:51] <+KSabot> Ugh I'll have to level a tank character
[0:58:51] <%templar010> Whelp I just finished maxxing SMN, guess DRK is next
[0:58:55] <+KoyaMusa> its more like they had a better writer
[0:58:56] <%TombstoneTTromboners> get ready for shadowbringers because it's written by the person who wrote it
[0:58:57] <@ThePlotHole> DRK questline writer is on the main writing team for Shadowbringers btw
[0:58:57] <Nemesis2098> @Lelric for tank, gladiator. dps, not thaumaturge unless you LOVE ,magic. for heals you only get conjurer to start
[0:58:58] <haisho> WHEW
[0:59:00] <+Sendaar> DRK is the cannon class imo
[0:59:00] <@ThePlotHole> So get ready for GOOD SHIT
[0:59:02] <@mothmandraws> I hear dragoon will make my heavensward run interesting
[0:59:04] <Neo_Kaiser> Voice acted voice
[0:59:04] <Kekon3> I love DRK 4.0 because I love Heavensward
[0:59:05] <%Cthulos> yes
[0:59:06] <%Darthwaffler> Does this game have fall damage?
[0:59:10] <%TheSniperJoe> DRK is pretty much the canon class.
[0:59:10] <%AquilaHarukaze> Yes.
[0:59:11] <haisho> for a moment I thought I was going to hear terrible manpotato voices
[0:59:15] <Zepik> but that WHM tree tho
[0:59:17] <%marsano168> I rolled Machinist and all I got was this lousy buddy cop story about nerds vs Jocks
[0:59:17] <%AquilaHarukaze> It cannot kill you unless you're in combat though.
[0:59:17] <ittla> being a tank makes you the main character and DRK is the most main character of them all
[0:59:18] <+phamchri> and that person who wrote the dark knioght quest is doing shadowbringers
[0:59:20] <tealwolf26> YOU are the voice actor now
[0:59:21] <NoirePanzer> GOOD
[0:59:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Given gasps and sighs like Aya Brea in The 3rd Birthday.
[0:59:23] <%AquilaHarukaze> Otherwise you're left with 1hp
[0:59:24] <Tucker0603> fuck yeah!!!!!
[0:59:26] <%TombstoneTTromboners> wow i never knew about this area
[0:59:31] <Rhonne> no wonder the dark knight is the face of shadowbringers
[0:59:39] <jackythefrost> He was also the writer for HW wasnt he
[0:59:40] <BlissieB> i really liked the 30-50, and the 60-70 quests for drk the most
[0:59:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> What a fitting character name
[0:59:43] <zamzoph> thighs Kreygasm
[0:59:44] <Kekon3> this quest line is AYAYA
[0:59:48] <ColRedyx> DRK questline also has the most overlap with the MSQ.
[0:59:49] <+MisterCrimson> "The next man who raises steel, I'll not only kill him, but his wife, his friends, and I'll burn his godsdamned house down"
[0:59:50] <Angry_Ev1L> you're gross
[0:59:52] <%kewlmyc> PAT IS RACIST
[0:59:52] <NoirePanzer> Dragon waifus yeyeyeye

[0:59:53] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:55] <spiegspikel> @angriestpat Kind of a random question, but did you happen to visit the Square Enix cafe when you went to Japan? I was just there yesterday. It’s not bad.

[1:12:21] <%BlitzNeidhart> FREE XP

[1:12:52] <alamorn> Does hide not reset your mudras anymore?
[1:12:53] <@Pandora_Prime> But if you don't kill them now, then the symbols will remain forever.
[1:12:55] <Basch71> the pre-order earring is like the only thing you need
[1:12:56] <+aeneous222> @Kirijuo nope

[1:13:05] <%D33TR> yes chat, killing 40 low enemies for an equivalent amount of exp as one dungeon mob is worth it

[1:13:07] <%Metballs> There is no time to track them down
[1:13:07] <Thalchampz> i did my lancer hunting log while waiting for the roulettes because DPS life sucks
[1:13:07] <@JustinianKnight> Hide does reset
[1:13:08] <ColRedyx> That will one-shot them
[1:13:10] <%RutilusMonachus> When you're around level 50, doing all of them up to level 40 might get him one level if he's lucky, probably not even a fraction of that
[1:13:11] <@JustinianKnight> also

[1:13:31] <televisedrevolting> @mothmandraws Like a Minh
[1:13:31] <%Kirijuo> Make a macro
[1:13:35] <Basch71> you can also use deathblossom to force it off
[1:13:36] <Nemesis2098> as a tank though, I can just que dungeon after dungeon cause im a god amongst dps
[1:13:39] <alamorn> I use a macro for it
[1:13:45] <%WheatlyXT> magic
[1:13:47] <Bielzitcho> you press select 3 times
[1:13:48] <@JustinianKnight> they give a free level pretty much
[1:14:02] <@JustinianKnight> so good to do while waiting for queues
[1:14:04] <%AquilaHarukaze> just do death blossom and accidentally pull the final boss of Ivalice like I did
[1:14:08] <%FreyRune> HIME-SAMAAAAA
[1:14:09] <Amaterasu98> Pat, did you clear any savage tiers this expansion?

[1:16:30] <+Double_Tap_That> Awschlong's Embrace?
[1:16:39] <+TheImmortal70> They won't change anything

[1:20:20] <%Guardiansaiyan> @alamorn KEEP the music
[1:20:26] <+Silentman0> @alamorn he shouldn't though
[1:20:51] <ShichiNoBushi> Or it could be, you know, any of these lightning elementals around here.

[1:21:10] <%spiritofmojave> @docmadfox it's not for everyone, beginning is a little sloggish but least you tried!
[1:21:15] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@DesuDesuDokiDoki) (warning)

[1:21:55] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat do cutscenes just use the game world's day/night cycle?
[1:22:01] <%Yadogari> First month doesn't have a message with it right?
[1:22:07] <DocMadfox> @spiritofmojave Didn't help the friends I was supposed to play it with decided to ditch me.

[1:23:12] <OkamiDude15> fuckin weebs
[1:23:13] <%FreyRune> naruto cosplay meetup at limsa
[1:23:13] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Not just a weeaboo, a Garlean weeaboo. A GARLEABOO
[1:23:17] <%spiritofmojave> we've come full circle
[1:23:25] <%Nobrev> aren't you also a dumb western ninja?
[1:23:28] <ameraaaaaa> sorry if I'm late
[1:23:30] <%Scevda> So not first month eh? Alright
[1:23:32] <+TheImmortal70> A garleaboo is the worst weaboo
[1:23:34] <haisho> @SpaceCaptainCrone That's actually the worst.
[1:23:40] <ameraaaaaa> hey what's happening
[1:23:43] <%Guardiansaiyan> Water walking JUTSU!
[1:23:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> ...Why would you attack with the king? O_o
[1:23:44] <ShichiNoBushi> If he was a true weeb, he would take caution to the "inverse ninja law" and come at you alone.
[1:23:47] <%Scevda> We then, Ill just have to try sending him here:
[1:23:48] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> @haisho I agree
[1:23:49] <+Silentman0> a chess match is DEFINITELY NOT won when a king comes out
[1:23:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> Does NO ONE play chess?
[1:23:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> like ever?
[1:24:03] <+TheImmortal70> BATS?
[1:24:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[1:24:08] <+TheImmortal70> NOT THE BATS
[1:24:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nOt tHe BaTs
[1:24:09] <%Guardiansaiyan> @SilvaChariot0133 cause even monarchies get bored...
[1:24:09] <+blademaster247> It's been a while since I've played, is there a reason he isn't using Huton?
[1:24:09] <alamorn> Need true north for that
[1:24:11] <haisho> BYATS
[1:24:12] <%NWR_James> guano
[1:24:20] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat is FFXIV paid subscription like WoW?
[1:24:23] <%FreyRune> I learnt chess from watching code geass
[1:24:24] <+Silentman0> yup
[1:24:31] <@mothmandraws> I worry true north will make me lazy dragoon
[1:24:55] <%yeknomlive> huton is up
[1:24:59] <$Valdorick> See, you know he's an evil ninja, because only the bad ninja use BATS
[1:25:01] <+TheImmortal70> @mothmandraws If you're worried about that, play DRG until you get wheeling thrust/fang and claw
[1:25:05] <%Faustgesicht> So DRK gets Character development, and NIN gets this Cringe
[1:25:06] <leonpup> @AngriestPat @peachsaliva when are you guys playing DBD again?
[1:25:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @arfsm95 u can get the first 35 lvls free
[1:25:10] <+Double_Tap_That> @arfsm95 You can play for free up to a certain level.
[1:25:11] <Kekon3> True North is good since bosses have a bad habit of doing their first mechanic right when trick needs to go out
[1:25:12] <%spiritofmojave> @freyrune is that where that ridiculous sub note came from? lmao
[1:25:12] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat also do you play WoW? will you play it on stream sometime maybe?
[1:25:15] <+blademaster247> @AngriestPat It's been a while since I've played, is there a reason you aren't using Huton?
[1:25:17] <+TheImmortal70> @mothmandraws By then you'll get the flow of using jumps and positioning down enough that it'll be muscle memory
[1:25:24] <OkamiDude15> you didnt win sfhCRY
[1:25:27] <+Ell1ot> bad end
[1:25:28] <%yeknomlive> he only needs to use huton once and then he uses armor crush to refresh it
[1:25:28] <%Yadogari> LUL
[1:25:28] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Shoulda hyoton'd him
[1:25:30] <%FreyRune> @spiritofmojave yes it is lololol
[1:25:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> might want to not kass the huton, it guarantees crit
[1:25:38] <+arfsm95> @DesuDesuDokiDoki @Double_Tap_That shit, can't do that, they will hook me up like a drug and i can't pay it
[1:25:40] <+TheImmortal70> But True north is generally so you don't have to move in times when you CAN"T move
[1:25:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> so use it on damaging moves
[1:25:40] <%spiritofmojave> @freyrune god I love that LUL
[1:25:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> is fine, nin is galaxy brain
[1:26:02] <Kekon3> Mudras are up every 20s
[1:26:05] <BourneWarrior> @angriestpat I just did a quest where Al Mhigan just get implied raped by a group called the Corpse Brigade like for real?
[1:26:07] <%yeknomlive> im so glad they added hide to refresh mudras
[1:26:07] <@mothmandraws> NINJA 2?
[1:26:16] <OkamiDude15> a crinja
[1:26:16] <zamzoph> Check out the princess Kreygasm
[1:26:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> awoooooooo
[1:26:18] <%Yadogari> I can't believe Pat never uses any mudra at all ever
[1:26:25] <+blademaster247> I'm dumb and I haven't played since they changed Huton from an icon at the top to the timer on the hud
[1:26:26] <Sydin18> gotta make sure that the princess has a tight booty
[1:26:29] <+Sir_gonthorian> is that the mont music ??

[1:54:35] <%Faustgesicht> the CRINGE
[1:54:38] <%NopeBadguy> the ninja questline is pretty stale
[1:54:39] <%NWR_James> Pat's Naurto OC Quest line
[1:54:41] <haveswordmuststing> @darthwaffler theres the Pissed effect where its confusion with a damage buff
[1:54:41] <%NopeBadguy> the drk questline is amazing
[1:54:48] <ameraaaaaa> please tell me i didn't miss the boss
[1:54:49] <%ESP_ROOT> D:
[1:54:49] <%Yadogari> When was the live letter again?
[1:55:02] <+MisterCrimson> monday
[1:55:11] <%Yadogari> Oh damn
[1:55:14] <MonstarGrrrl> he keeps pooping daggers
[1:55:16] <%FreyRune> my favourite dungeon would probably by Shisui and Doma castle
[1:55:23] <%ESP_ROOT> is the liveletter during sqeenixs e3 conference?
[1:55:32] <Resderp> Live Letter is the 13th
[1:55:36] <Kekon3> Not Hildebrand?
[1:55:40] <%Lapinelis> Shame I don't want to play a tank :<
[1:55:54] <Bielzitcho> tanks are fun
[1:55:54] <ameraaaaaa> elmo sad?
[1:55:56] <Mrthepastyrider> more games need to have magical gunslinger classes, that's legit my chief aesthetic
[1:56:04] <ameraaaaaa> poor elmo
[1:56:06] <%Darthwaffler> @haveswordmuststing That's bad but manageable and even beneficial if you get rid of confusion.
[1:56:07] <Kekon3> DRK is a DPS with a Tank Icon
[1:56:09] <%NWR_James> 13 is Thursday
[1:56:10] <%Yadogari> Wait the 13th is Thursday isn't it?
[1:56:16] <Resderp> Yep, Thursday
[1:56:16] <%ESP_ROOT> elmo :(
[1:56:18] <+Rose_Silver> I thought pat said on the podcasts all his classes were 70
[1:56:19] <%FreyRune> nah, the best quest line is the Ivalice raids
[1:56:29] <ameraaaaaa> mad elmo
[1:56:30] <%PontiusPyrite> no its on friday
[1:56:32] <MC_GigglePants> 13th is thursday
[1:56:34] <%PontiusPyrite> you just got the date number wrong
[1:56:35] <Resderp> 13th is thursday
[1:56:44] <JDebss> hope it's as good as last time
[1:56:45] <+TheImmortal70> Wait there's another live letter? What for?
[1:56:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> TIMEZONES
[1:56:55] <Kekon3> Think there's gonna be anything shown at E3?
[1:56:56] <%FreyRune> @rose_silver probably meant his crafters and gatherers
[1:56:57] <Resderp> @TheImmortal70 General 5.0 stuff
[1:56:57] <JDebss> wonder if they filled that job opening
[1:57:00] <haveswordmuststing> @darthwaffler SMT also has several "death" status effects like stone and maybe bomb
[1:57:18] <Kekon3> Stack up to spread the damage amongst the party
[1:57:34] <Resderp> You could also cheese it and murder the slimes
[1:57:36] <Kekon3> instead of 1 person taking 100%, 4 people take 25%
[1:57:43] <Kekon3> love that shit
[1:57:57] <%FreyRune> the last live letter was a nightmare and meme worthy
[1:57:59] <zamzoph> Wait, is Pat playing Monster Hunter?!
[1:58:01] <%Mekhet09> So did you level blue mage up? I think it's the most disappointing class in the game.
[1:58:10] <TerryTheTurret> Made the mistake of ignoring the green one when running squadrons...
[1:58:11] <%Yadogari> Man I'm gonna miss the live letter, I get home at 8 that day
[1:58:27] <Kekon3> I feel so bad because I told everyone it would be worth watching, and it was, but like, lordy
[1:58:44] <%PontiusPyrite> the live letter is on the 14th
[1:58:45] <Resderp> It's really on Thursday
[1:58:49] <%Yadogari> It's on Friday, but the Friday is the 14th
[1:58:51] <garbageheaphound> 13th
[1:58:51] <+Tsarwerewolf> Goodbye chat
[1:58:54] <+Tsarwerewolf> Time to sleep
[1:58:55] <%Nobrev> im pretty sure it's still on friday, it's just that the 13th is thursday
[1:59:01] <MC_GigglePants> It's on friday but you said the wrong date
[1:59:01] <%spiritofmojave> 13th is a Thurs yes
[1:59:23] <%NWR_James> YOU said it was 13
[1:59:30] <ameraaaaaa> bye bye sleepy head
[1:59:32] <%Darthwaffler> @haveswordmuststing On the subject of SMT, "Die For Me" is probably my favorite move in the series. That move is why I always have Alice in my party, as it is exclusive to her.
[1:59:38] <xxshadowxx416> so what going to be at e3
[1:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[2:01:11] <televisedrevolting> Hey, just came out of the shower. Did Pat beat the jumping challenge?
[2:01:16] <ameraaaaaa> what's so bad about blue mage
[2:01:19] <%Guardiansaiyan> @televisedrevolting yes
[2:01:22] <Kekon3> Use BLU to grind these event tomes PAT
[2:01:27] <%spiritofmojave> Remember when folks were thinking ShB would make it a full class lmao
[2:01:32] <+KnightsoftheOnion> pat for ff14 advertising guru. his logo, 'give me money and i'll shill sure'
[2:01:35] <%FreyRune> blue mage is good for speed farming mog tomes
[2:01:36] <%Mekhet09> It can't be used in anything relevant and it has shit damage with what you can use.
[2:01:37] <Resderp> BLU was never gonna be a full job LUL
[2:01:37] <%SilvaChariot0133> RIP hide
[2:01:40] <televisedrevolting> Damn. Gonna have to watch the vods then.
[2:01:41] <%SergeEXE> It's a Limited Class, only goes to 50
[2:01:45] <%RutilusMonachus> Blue Mage is a weird class that is a Limited Class, that means it has a lower level cap, and is more restricted
[2:01:46] <%Lapinelis> If you pass items a lot, do you get a higher chance to get them when you do want something?

[2:03:22] <+arbiduck> @ameraaaaaa BLU can't be played at level cap, it's sort of side solo content with its own rules
[2:03:27] <%SergeEXE> @ameraaaaaa BLU is side content, for real. can't even register for duty finder
[2:03:36] <ameraaaaaa> interesting
[2:03:44] <Kekon3> you can use BLU if you have a premade

[2:05:05] <haisho> time to beat that jump puzzle
[2:05:08] <%FreyRune> @sergeexe right now it's easy to farm mog tomestones so it has one benefit, but yeah it's useless lol
[2:05:10] <ameraaaaaa> what about samurai
[2:05:13] <+KnightsoftheOnion> do odin in duty finder XD
[2:05:14] <%ESP_ROOT> jump puzzle time!

[2:05:34] <+griffball13> damn that is a huge jump
[2:05:38] <$Valdorick> 105
[2:05:40] <%spiritofmojave> or neither!
[2:05:40] <%ESP_ROOT> 75
[2:05:40] <SweetCuppingCake> Ahhh, I was so nervous healing lol
[2:05:42] <%NWR_James> We goin to 65, boys!
[2:05:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> Sam is easiest dps, but kinda braindead as a result
[2:05:44] <%Aeogard> damn 11 levels in a single dungeon?
[2:05:47] <%Yadogari> You heard it here, 65 or jump puzzle
[2:05:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> PogChamp
[2:05:50] <%Nobrev> no you have to do 65 now you already said it twice

[2:06:13] <+RushUnplugged> sam is better monk, change my mind
[2:06:13] <+TheEdrem> the last jump is always the worse
[2:06:13] <+Estuko> oh jesus what
[2:06:18] <garbageheaphound> you....did it
[2:06:23] <ameraaaaaa> what about samurai and also is astrolgeon random?
[2:06:25] <%AquilaHarukaze> That run was awkward for me because I just recently switched from an xbox controller to a dualshock orz
[2:06:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> moral victory :^)
[2:06:28] <%FreyRune> COWARD
[2:06:28] <+TheEdrem> there is a way to setup last jump so it's perfect
[2:06:30] <ShichiNoBushi> Teleport away mid-jump.
[2:06:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:06:34] <+Noponiz> the hardest jump is still ahead
[2:06:37] <+Noponiz> dont get carried away

[2:07:37] <ameraaaaaa> @angriestpat what's the difference between scholar and white mage
[2:07:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> Where da holy spam at

[2:08:15] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat WHM has hots
[2:08:21] <%Mekhet09> That fairy can carry you for a long while if you are a scrub.
[2:08:27] <Baconrath> are there any options to cut down on nameplates obstructing your view?
[2:08:28] <%AquilaHarukaze> @TheShal As a full-time tank I've gotten used to just PRAYING the healer is holding out for a last-minute oGCD save when I see my HP drop
[2:08:34] <+TheImmortal70> There are options
[2:08:43] <+Marsidicus> You can turn nameplates off entirely if you want @Baconrath
[2:08:45] <Resderp> @Baconrath There are in display name settings
[2:08:47] <%SergeEXE> @baconrath The entire UI is customizable
[2:08:48] <+Marsidicus> Either that or set them to show first initials.
[2:08:49] <%AquilaHarukaze> @SweetCuppingCake Likewise :D
[2:08:57] <+Noponiz> single target doton lets go
[2:09:01] <ameraaaaaa> so a nuke ass heal is a big aoe heal right
[2:09:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> Where da Holy at NotLikeThis
[2:09:08] <Baconrath> cause that was one of my big beefs when i played this
[2:09:09] <%Yadogari> Who needs to heal when you have benediction and tetragrammaton LUL
[2:09:11] <%heazeus> heazeus subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! love you dad
[2:09:12] <%TheShal> @AquilaHarukaze As a BLM main. I'm used to seeing the tank die, and suddenly becoming a Tank
[2:09:22] <+Marsidicus> WHM needs to holy, needs to stun those mobs.
[2:09:26] <%FreyRune> the best part to XIV is you have so much freedom with UI and hot bar settings
[2:09:28] <Angry_Ev1L> Cure spam
[2:09:37] <%SilvaChariot0133> no Holy
[2:09:42] <Angry_Ev1L> Then doing nothing Kappa
[2:09:44] <%SergeEXE> holy plz
[2:09:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> FailFish
[2:09:45] <Angry_Ev1L> What a HERO
[2:09:50] <ameraaaaaa> @angriestpat what's the difference between warrior paladin and samurai
[2:09:51] <%Scevda> You did it
[2:10:09] <%Nobrev> I think pat cant see holies because no party effects
[2:10:11] <+Noponiz> look at the WHM's glamour. Someone that wears that probably doesnt even have holy on their hotbad LUL
[2:10:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> nah, would be able to hear it
[2:10:20] <%Scevda> your hp, uh, it doent move much
[2:10:20] <%ESP_ROOT> monkaS music
[2:10:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> and well... see the stuns
[2:10:31] <$theluckyhero> Is Gunbreaker any good?
[2:10:39] <MC_GigglePants> Gunbreaker isn't out yet
[2:10:39] <Resderp> We dont know
[2:10:41] <%ESP_ROOT> theyre not out yet
[2:10:43] <%SergeEXE> it's not out
[2:10:47] <Resderp> We wont know until Gunbreaker is out on the 28th
[2:10:51] <$theluckyhero> oh okay
[2:11:02] <%AquilaHarukaze> Oh yeah I've gotten used to BLM just always biting at the ankles of my aggro. I'm absolutely no good at casters and you guys are damn powerhouses
[2:11:05] <ameraaaaaa> ok how does a samurai play chat
[2:11:08] <+Noponiz> there hjas never been a class not good enough to clear all content. Power difference is always single digit %. Don't worry about what's good or not
[2:11:14] <%Cthulos> MUDA
[2:11:17] <Resderp> A samurai is literally the easiest melee dps to play
[2:11:21] <Resderp> Not much to it, really
[2:11:27] <%AquilaHarukaze> Also not gonna lie I lost it when Pat reacted to my name
[2:11:29] <%FreyRune> dont listen to what people say about gun breaker yet, the potency numbers may change when5.0 is live
[2:11:32] <valanway_diabolos> Easy to play, but not the easiest to optimize
[2:11:33] <%spiritofmojave> @ameraaaaaa pretty simple, lotta debuffs and short rotation of moves
[2:11:34] <%ESP_ROOT> i wanna play SAM so bad lytWIPED
[2:11:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> Good ol' Raffy
[2:11:40] <XyraFhoan> also the jobs good at dungeons are not necessarily the ones preferred for raiding anyway
[2:11:40] <flattopswag> I used to main BLM but decided to not have subscriptions while in school/unemployed...new expansion is tempting though
[2:11:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Ochus?
[2:11:42] <%Kilagn> Plant evil
[2:11:44] <haisho> they're just nasty ass creatures
[2:11:49] <Baconrath> throwback to malboros?
[2:11:52] <$Valdorick> That last word... should tell you why Kappa
[2:11:53] <TheNocturnalScotsman> ochu's are classic if thats what it is
[2:11:53] <ameraaaaaa> yay!
[2:11:57] <%Yadogari> They're penis fly traps, the adventurer's worst enemy
[2:11:57] <%madhattergay> sometimes i think about evil plants in games like TFW you get your ass kicked by salad
[2:12:02] <%PontiusPyrite> skyfucker
[2:12:04] <%Kilagn> I mean alot of classic FF enemies are plants
[2:12:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Japan at the mention of big tentacles: REAL SHIT?
[2:12:09] <ameraaaaaa> ok what does a warrior play like
[2:12:20] <MonstarGrrrl> hit things
[2:12:21] <Resderp> Dps tank.
[2:12:28] <valanway_diabolos> BIG damage tank
[2:12:28] <%Yadogari> I'm just glad Malboros don't appear often
[2:12:31] <%AquilaHarukaze> unga bunga swing da axe
[2:12:33] <haveswordmuststing> also i imagine they could possibly reuse rigs MonHun style
[2:12:33] <neroame> Like metal music
[2:12:35] <$Valdorick> Warrior Cleave, big Cleave
[2:12:42] <%NoMoreHero51> do you like big numbers? that's a warrior lol
[2:12:43] <%FreyRune> Fell cleeve, Fell cleeve
[2:12:51] <Resderp> Warrior: Be angry at thins until they die
[2:12:52] <valanway_diabolos> Warrior Unga, enemies Bunga
[2:12:55] <TheDiddlerz> Enemies in dungeons aren't "Elites" like in WoW, are they?
[2:13:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> There might a lot of enemy variations but there can't be too many enemy types
[2:13:09] <%AquilaHarukaze> Unlike the other two tanks, you're less of a defensive wall and more of a fat HP sponge.
[2:13:09] <$Valdorick> They're harder, if that's what you mean
[2:13:14] <%theluckyhero> theluckyhero subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:13:14] <%spiritofmojave> Warrior: FELL CLEAVE IT ALL
[2:13:21] <%TheShal> Lucid! Lucid you fool
[2:13:27] <%AquilaHarukaze> Well, that'll change in 5.0 but still.
[2:13:31] <+Ell1ot> doesn't the black mage have an unaggro button?
[2:13:37] <%SilvaChariot0133> ye
[2:13:40] <Resderp> Not without role actions, no.
[2:13:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> Lucid
[2:13:42] <ameraaaaaa> ok how does a paladin play
[2:13:45] <$Valdorick> But... that takes a GCD
[2:13:47] <valanway_diabolos> Lucid Dream is for BABIES
[2:13:57] <haveswordmuststing> @ameraaaaaa lots of AOE i believe
[2:13:59] <%TheShal> Lucid Dreaming AKA BLM Shirk
[2:14:10] <%AquilaHarukaze> Paladin playstyle is switching back and forth between weaponskill combos and magic combos
[2:14:18] <%FreyRune> back in my days, lucid used to be called shroud
[2:14:22] <Baconrath> Bard gang PogChamp
[2:14:28] <Resderp> Back in my days, shroud used to be a WHM only ability
[2:14:33] <%AquilaHarukaze> And you got a whole bunch of options to help the party out
[2:14:37] <%TheShal> Back in my day, BRD was a mage
[2:14:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> Great Googly Moogly it's all gone to shit!
[2:14:50] <%AquilaHarukaze> And you've got a shield so an extra layer of defense over the other two.
[2:15:12] <%spiritofmojave> Back in my day BRD couldn't cause copyright fringements
[2:15:13] <%Scevda> I remember now, that one sound effect is the hunter beam cannon from Halo
[2:15:20] <%Cthulos> apatPorgmo MUDA
[2:15:27] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Back in my day Dragoon's could pole dance. i miss you ring of thorns, BibleThump
[2:15:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @ameraaaaaa Very simple, the simplest of all the tanks. You just maintain control the enemy and use some damage reduction to stay alive and that's it
[2:15:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> Huton>hide>suiton
[2:15:40] <Resderp> I miss Rain of Death
[2:15:45] <Resderp> It was fancy
[2:15:48] <%TheShal> In retrospect, I HATE how late BLMs get fire 4 in Heavensward.
[2:15:57] <%TheShal> Our whole rotation doesn't come together till the end
[2:16:00] <%Chichen> Pat my cat is on my lap watching the stream chicheDex
[2:16:02] <+MisterRockett> Finally off work. Does Pat know the trick to memorizing the Jutsus?
[2:16:03] <flattopswag> Wasn't in like 68 or 70?
[2:16:07] <%Cthulos> apatGib MuDa MUDA MUDA MUDA
[2:16:07] <flattopswag> For Fire 4, I mean
[2:16:08] <ameraaaaaa> so ok now I'm thinking of a warrior a samurai a white mage or a scholar
[2:16:13] <Resderp> @flattopswag What? No. It was 60
[2:16:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> F gonna jump
[2:16:22] <%TheShal> 60
[2:16:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> the ticks crit
[2:16:25] <%FreyRune> I dont miss the days when healers are struggling to heal because they forgot to turn off Cleric stance
[2:16:31] <flattopswag> Oh wait I'm totally thinking of something else, nm
[2:16:52] <Resderp> Back in my day, WHMs had stoneskin FeelsBadMan
[2:16:59] <Resderp> and Stoneskin 2
[2:17:09] <+Smokebanshee> After almost 12 hours of clicking a fucking placard I finnally got my house
[2:17:16] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @flattopswag You might be thinking of enhanced umbral heart, the thing that lets you do 2 flares
[2:17:16] <%spiritofmojave> I will miss SCH Ruin-city but it did need a nerf
[2:17:21] <%madhattergay> thats just a yugioh monster
[2:17:29] <P1ngas> some you guys didnt have to wait for the WHM to cast 8 stoneskins before the pull in coil and it shows
[2:17:29] <neroame> 12 hours
[2:17:32] <neroame> Yikes
[2:17:37] <+Smokebanshee> almost
[2:17:44] <%Yadogari> Man I miss stoneskin
[2:17:49] <%Yadogari> I still have it on my hotbar
[2:17:55] <flattopswag> @Reizie_Etherealm Nah it's just been awhile and I was thinking "58 or 60"
[2:18:08] <%Guardiansaiyan> Bye Bye everyone! Its night time for me
[2:18:15] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I see
[2:18:15] <%JGardner88> Man I miss Stoneskin
[2:18:17] <%Guardiansaiyan> GivePLZ Nighty TakeNRG
[2:18:21] <%Chichen> Being 7 feet tall makes you a pretty bad ninja
[2:18:23] <ameraaaaaa> @angriestpat with the help of you and chat I've narrowed it down to warrior white mage scholar snd samurai
[2:18:25] <%spiritofmojave> @guardiansaiyan Night sugoiSchleep
[2:18:26] <Covil91> You can True North Trick Attack
[2:18:28] <lord_winter_555> are you a bad enough ninja to rescue these dudes
[2:18:30] <%NoMoreHero51> @angriestpat you need to Naruto harder
[2:18:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Good night!
[2:18:38] <%AquilaHarukaze> I think I'm gonna switch back to the xbox gamepad... It's too difficult for me to hold down L2 and press the D-pad buttons while moving the left thumbstick.
[2:18:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> nah see, they're gonna be looking for sneaky people
[2:18:54] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Remember when DRK was released and everyone was spamming Unleashed?
[2:18:59] <+claudesavegely> leveling mch to 70 before the expansion sucks
[2:19:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Chichen its the least likely person who you'd suspect ;3
[2:19:06] <%BlitzNeidhart> New MCH is not that great either
[2:19:08] <Kekon3> nah, I've cleared with even MCH
[2:19:09] <Angry_Ev1L> even MCH is not bad if you play it properly... it has problems tho
[2:19:11] <ColRedyx> @AquilaHarukaze Yeah I tried both as well, Xbox controller is WAY better for this game.
[2:19:15] <%ESP_ROOT> machininst is one of those lv 50 jobs right?
[2:19:16] <%FreyRune> machinist is only good for pvp
[2:19:18] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I remember when Ishgard was overrun with DRKs
[2:19:24] <Resderp> @ESP_ROOT 30
[2:19:27] <ameraaaaaa> hmmm btw I've never played an mmo except wow once as a kid
[2:19:34] <+Marsidicus> You mean people don't still do that?
[2:19:35] <%ESP_ROOT> @Resderp ohh thanks
[2:19:36] <Basch71> you mean standing in towns with darkside on
[2:19:46] <ameraaaaaa> so I'm open to learning about mmos
[2:19:48] <neroame> Unleash is cool af
[2:19:48] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat You realize we're getting an aoe combo off unleashed, so we're going back to that right?
[2:19:48] <CurrySauseBandit> @ESP_ROOT That needs context
[2:20:03] <%AquilaHarukaze> I figured it was worth a shot, I like how the buttons feel but the dpad is just better in the middle
[2:20:17] <Kekon3> the real shit about MCH is its burst window is fucking tiny, and only the best of the best connections can handle it
[2:20:26] <count_bob> @AngriestPat What's your favorite mount in the game?
[2:20:27] <%Nobrev> no it still shows out of battle. the red mist right?
[2:20:31] <Resderp> New MCH's new wildfire is nice now.
[2:20:37] <+Marsidicus> Yeah the red mist is still there Pat.
[2:20:37] <%Nobrev> unless you mean in shb
[2:20:42] <Resderp> Now it's just squeezing in as many weaponskills in that window instead of damage
[2:20:49] <+Marsidicus> Oh I guess ShB might be different.
[2:20:52] <MC_GigglePants> he def meant in ShB
[2:21:01] <+Smokebanshee> The fact that people actually wanted darkside to be even brighter and more noticable makes me hurt
[2:21:06] <%spiritofmojave> I'm so glad Gauss is gone for MCH, makes getting past the intro level 30 quest bearable lmao
[2:21:17] <%spiritofmojave> *gonna be gone
[2:21:34] <%TheShal> Oh. No wonder he's not getting a ton of XP from this. He's out of Rested XP.
[2:21:41] <ColRedyx> Honestly, I love all the new spell effects MCH is getting, but the actual rotation looks even less fun than the current one :\
[2:21:42] <Lotharman> Gotta Ninja Tank
[2:21:51] <%Hammerknife> Hammerknife subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Wow I didn't know Pat played Grandia Online! HF man
[2:21:51] <+GloomSpringer> what....
[2:21:54] <%ESP_ROOT> the them
[2:21:59] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I know what you mean
[2:22:02] <Angry_Ev1L> ???
[2:22:03] <+Rabbitmage> Which class is the best tank in FF14 right now?
[2:22:04] <%ESP_ROOT> NotLikeThis
[2:22:07] <%spiritofmojave> @colredyx we'll have to see!
[2:22:13] <%spiritofmojave> what
[2:22:18] <Resderp> There is no best tank really. Its all personal preference @Rabbitmage
[2:22:19] <%AquilaHarukaze> There is none! They're all great in their own ways!
[2:22:21] <%Shadowthedigger> Shit man you still fucking going?
[2:22:23] <%TheShal> @Rabbitmage WAR and PLD
[2:22:27] <%BlitzNeidhart> @Rabbitmage They're quite balanced
[2:22:28] <ColRedyx> @Rabbitmage Whichever one you're the best at playing.
[2:22:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> Now don't get nuked this time huh?
[2:22:32] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @Rabbitmage In terms of damage, utility or damage mitigation?
[2:22:32] <+Rabbitmage> WAR is best tank? wtf
[2:22:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> F
[2:22:38] <%FreyRune> honestly I'm happy that monk is going to be good for ShB
[2:22:46] <a_mad_dragon> GO TO FUCKING BED PAT
[2:22:47] <+Rabbitmage> In terms of tanking
[2:22:48] <%BlitzNeidhart> Yeah, WAR is fantastic
[2:22:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> Monk getting sent back to 2.0 FeelsBadMan
[2:22:54] <Resderp> They all do their jobs well at tanking.
[2:23:00] <Resderp> There is no best tank, it's all subjective.
[2:23:01] <valanway_diabolos> Come ShB all tanks are going to be 50/50 for best, in theory at least
[2:23:02] <ColRedyx> @Rabbitmage None of them. Whichever one you're the best at is the one you will do best with.
[2:23:04] <%spiritofmojave> Man me too, MNK needed love @freyrune
[2:23:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> RIP TK
[2:23:14] <+Rabbitmage> That's a non-answer
[2:23:24] <ColRedyx> No, it's the only right answer.
[2:23:36] <+Rabbitmage> If you dont know that's ok
[2:23:38] <ColRedyx> The world first race for the ultimates had all the tanks.
[2:23:40] <Resderp> If you want the best defensive tank, it's PLD. If you want the best offensive tank, it's WAR.
[2:23:41] <Angry_Ev1L> meanwhile everybody was shitting on DRK and how it wasn't meta it was world first in UCOB or UWU? Or both? lol
[2:23:41] <ameraaaaaa> how does one play a tank and what's skills are needed for it and what's the appeal of tanks or specifically the warrior
[2:23:43] <Resderp> If you want a mix of both, it's DRK
[2:23:54] <%ESP_ROOT> SourPls
[2:24:12] <ColRedyx> @Rabbitmage You're never going to be good at tanking if you try to use balance as a crutch. If you want to be successful, work on your own skills.
[2:24:20] <ScrapSentinel> Tioman PogChamp
[2:24:21] <CountMeowingtonn> the best tank is the one you're best at, they're all like .% different in performance
[2:24:26] <neroame> Play DRK and spam edgy macro lines
[2:24:36] <valanway_diabolos> ^
[2:24:42] <Resderp> In the end every job is viable, it comes down to player skill first and foremost.
[2:24:48] <neroame> Everyone loves em
[2:24:48] <%FreyRune> as a tank main, I enjoy all 3. it's really up to the player's preference on what is best
[2:24:49] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @Rabbitmage PLD makes health go down slow with damage reduction, WAR keep their health up with HP regenerating attacks, DRK is a mystery to me so I can't help you with that lol
[2:24:59] <+Rabbitmage> So Paladin is best at tanking then?
[2:25:01] <+gwanzan> ninja is full of bullshit to manage, especially if you have to run dodge aoe's as well
[2:25:04] <%QuadraticGravity> lmao
[2:25:11] <Angry_Ev1L> @Rabbitmage yes
[2:25:11] <%Hammerknife> god i quit GW2 cold turkey years ago and haven't touched a MMO since
[2:25:14] <ColRedyx> lol he really is hopeless
[2:25:16] <%QuadraticGravity> This dude is convinced that there HAS to be a best huh
[2:25:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> patruto attacc, but also he attacc
[2:25:21] <%spiritofmojave> People shit on RDM all the time for damage but it still can be real good 8n the right hands, most jobs are entirely viable
[2:25:23] <+Rabbitmage> Ok cool finally a real answer. Thanks!
[2:25:27] <ColRedyx> I feel bad for whoever he tanks for
[2:25:29] <+Sassafras1594> @angriestpat have you done savage raids?
[2:25:30] <CountMeowingtonn> Paladin is the best at supporting other tanks
[2:25:31] <Baconrath> play bard and rubberband between archer coats and S&M gear doodLewd
[2:25:39] <%Reizie_Etherealm> There is no best, that's the problem
