[0:03:06] <%JJCheeker> Yeah this does not look good
[0:03:07] <+shry7> stuttering very noticeable
[0:03:12] <%its_just_coach> looks like leak footage for oblivion
[0:03:17] <%JobbedBone> just think you could walk through there and it looks better than vanilla oblivion.
[0:03:19] <sweetestbeefs> BAD
[0:03:22] <%WhereIsWill> but what about max tho?!
[0:03:22] <sweetestbeefs> ITS BAD
[0:03:22] <Jetsfantasy> Have you tested switching rendering to CPU in order to avoid making your GPU multitask.
[0:03:25] <%orcstr16> Man, high elves are such fucks. I love them. 10/10
[0:03:30] <Suleks> i only see 720, did you drop the resolution?
[0:03:32] <GarouFGC> Is he using the DX11 or 12(Beta)? for this here WH Benchmark.
