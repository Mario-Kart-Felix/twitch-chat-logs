[1:11:05] <%nofestu2> Blazekin is a chicken that kicks people
[1:11:06] <%badchoice5> Normal = Ryu, Fire = Sagat
[1:11:07] <%AbnormalVoid> Wouldn't Ryu be Fighting Type?
[1:11:07] <$cureneckbeard> Rye-you!
[1:11:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Can we all just admit that Electric type is best?
[1:11:09] <fabnanman> WATER>ALL
[1:11:10] <KINGRAV3> Youre wearing a red shirt rn
[1:11:10] <%LethargicRush> pat dosent respect the RAGE of fire types

[1:11:32] <%Toynota10> i dunno anyone who dislikes psychic types
[1:11:32] <pectusumbra> Team ghost represent!
[1:11:33] <%PeaceCentennial> Fairy types are great
[1:11:33] <%Mystery_Syringe_Hobo> Pat has good taste, but also Ghost types
[1:11:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Can we all just agree Electric type is the best type, followed by fighting
[1:11:33] <%SpamKingRathalos> Blaziken is one of the best damn things to come outta pokemon
[1:11:33] <%Niney_Who> I like any fuckable pokemon
[1:11:33] <Yrefe> y'all need to accept Haxorus as your lord and savior

[1:11:42] <Burgesteel> We need an "eldrich" type
[1:11:43] <@SSaryn> Fairy types are fucking garbage and kill everything about the new pokemon games and I havent played them so shut up I'm right
[1:11:44] <ChefDinoMD> Rock for the fossil pokemon
[1:11:45] <%OwlLightningMage> How can any of the types be the Ryu of the game. That makes no sense LUL
[1:11:46] <%Metballs> Sylveon exists

[1:11:48] <%Toynota10> Blaziken's the shit tho

[1:11:50] <KangarooCyborg> 400 billion dead eevees

[1:11:56] <%Mystery_Syringe_Hobo> Extra BOOOO
[1:12:00] <blue6sub6remnant6> Does pat like Jiggypuff or Clefairy? That's Fairy. I think.

[1:12:54] <%HRDSalami654> "Possible".
[1:12:54] <%DirtyGaijin> They was Lasso'd back into the office
[1:12:54] <$valriot> ITS GARBAGE
[1:12:55] <%D33TR> beat RDR 2. it really does drag a lot
[1:12:56] <Revant_tillywink> red dead red... ResidentSleeper
[1:12:57] <%FackinCrazy> THAK YOU
[1:12:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Normal-types are kind of underrated regarding type weaknesses. They are only vulnerable to Fighting-type attacks and are immune to Ghost-types. Also a lot of attacks are Normal-type, so they get STAB bonus to those.
[1:12:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I enjoyed playing RDR2 tho
[1:12:58] <%PalmtopNami> i disagree
[1:12:58] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Online is garbage too
[1:12:59] <%JJCheeker> Yeah they really need to rethink their whole formula
[1:12:59] <$rytyoung> Indeed it does drag
[1:13:00] <mastermidget23> I mean, I enjoyed it, but I can understand that sentiment.
[1:13:01] <ShreddingPixels> it's fun
[1:13:02] <Kindan55> Wrong
[1:13:02] <%DedlokPM> what game is he talking about?
[1:13:03] <pectusumbra> sorry what are we talking-ah, red dead
[1:13:03] <+Bupkis7> NO IT’s NOT!
[1:13:04] <%Mystery_Syringe_Hobo> @majindusto I been hoping for that for years! Also ghost type where you just throw Eevee into traffic to evolve it
[1:13:04] <+mrboo001> Story is 9/10, world is 11/10, gameplay is 5/10
[1:13:04] <%D33TR> but it was still an amazing game
[1:13:05] <blue6sub6remnant6> Wait, didn't Pat love RDR2?
[1:13:06] <Pookiedaexzile> rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroasted
[1:13:07] <+Bupkis7> 1111111111
[1:13:09] <%King_Wulgard> The tea is HOT
[1:13:09] <+Jordan_z123> It drags too much but it’s still fun
[1:13:10] <%Metballs> This is accurate
[1:13:10] <%reiju_22> @DedlokPM red dead
[1:13:12] <dekkitout> Fast travel
[1:13:12] <%these_pockets> botw had less and managed to feel like it had more with tight fluid gameplay. RDR2 sucked.
[1:13:14] <Caidezes> Pat's correct.
[1:13:14] <+Tokanova> i'd add cars
[1:13:15] <KangarooCyborg> fast travel
[1:13:17] <%MelancholicMasochist> I 100% it and I hate it
[1:13:18] <+kimonochrono> boah
[1:13:19] <raveous> FUCK AUTENTICITY
[1:13:20] <%patriotrenegade> who cares about authenticity
[1:13:21] <simulationbard> better pacing
[1:13:22] <%badchoice5> REAL LIFE IS BORING
[1:13:23] <cosmicdischarge> @AngriestPat Why don't you try borderlands 2 you will love it trust me
[1:13:24] <+kimonochrono> pat has lumbago
[1:13:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> Replace the horses with dirtbikes
[1:13:24] <KangarooCyborg> All it needs is goddamn good fast travel
[1:13:25] <Eternal_Harmony> rdr1 was awesome
[1:13:26] <Alchemystee> honestly i thought that those "boring" moments really added to the vibe and the story
[1:13:26] <%LethargicRush> so pat are you gonna play GUN?
[1:13:27] <+JackMillerTime> yeah red dead revolver was great
[1:13:28] <%vectorless_peon> The game is boreing not crazy talk this time
[1:13:29] <Zajim> Yea never played it, never wanted to, looked basically just a polished of the first 1 and I'd had enough from the first one
[1:13:29] <@SSaryn> Literally put any QoL change into RDR2 and you make it so much better
[1:13:30] <yourliteraldog> Cut out literally several story beats
[1:13:31] <$rytyoung> I agree, everything takes too long to do
[1:13:32] <%machshop> it was like playing a western
[1:13:33] <Caidezes> "R E A L I S M"
[1:13:35] <%mastertwin2> A game still needs to feel like a game
[1:13:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> RDR2 made me hate RDR1
[1:13:39] <%FackinCrazy> It needed fast travel so fucking bad
[1:13:41] <%DedlokPM> @reiju_22 thank you. Figured it out when he said "Everything is so slow" LUL
[1:13:42] <%snow_bush> He likes slow cats!
[1:13:44] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat I like slow streams Kappa

[1:13:52] <%ThatGuyfromMars> 1
[1:13:54] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> breaking bad is slow to you?
[1:13:55] <KangarooCyborg> Horse balls also need to be bigger 2/10
[1:13:55] <%King_Krimzon> Red Dead Redemption 1 is the perfect amount of slow.
[1:13:56] <%Swiglou> LUL
[1:14:00] <yourliteraldog> Maybe a chapter or two
[1:14:01] <Icetrainerayv> 1
[1:14:06] <Youngforlife> It really is and the online is worse
[1:14:07] <%GohanEgret> 90s? You mean 80s?
[1:14:08] <%CerberusDriver> RDR2 had fast travel though...
[1:14:08] <$Wisconsinite> 80's*
[1:14:10] <%badchoice5> 80s
[1:14:10] <Kindan55> Breaking bad isn't slow?
[1:14:13] <%Ion_LaserX> 80's*
[1:14:16] <majindusto> "Red Dead 2"
[1:14:17] <bigbradish> That would be the 80s
[1:14:17] <sakuraa98> I thought riding around on your horse was always engrossing and fun even though it shouldn't be
[1:14:18] <simulationbard> Realism should not get in the way of making an entreating price of media
[1:14:18] <artoflec> it also just controls like shit, you can get used to the controls but it's still so bad
[1:14:19] <%JJCheeker> I mean I guess season 2 of Breaking Bad is a little slow but it's not later on
[1:14:21] <moogleboy1984> 700+ hours confirmed
[1:14:21] <%Ion_LaserX> The Bears Were Shit in the 90's

[1:29:51] <CalderGaming> Magikarp and Gyarados
[1:29:52] <%brave_sj> People told Nishiki to stop being such a pussy, so he became a dick instead

[1:30:35] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> It represents his longing to be like his kyodai.
[1:30:35] <ender344> Pat, the tattooist chooses the tattoo, not the recipient

[1:39:12] <Rincewind1998> That's a "fuck you crowds" move
[1:39:15] <cumurasame> but Aquarius is renamed Poseidon in Kiwami 2 lmao
[1:39:20] <%supersugoisenpai1> Yakuza is like Akiba's Trip, but with good gameplay and graphics

[1:43:25] <%korth367> yeah
[1:43:25] <%Chichen> Yes
[1:43:25] <KeiPrime> yes

[1:43:27] <suikudo> @AngriestPat You throw a pokeball and the Dragon of Dojima comes out
[1:43:27] <%alexandrecau> yes
[1:43:28] <%Big_Dream> yeah
[1:43:28] <%starotter70> Yes
[1:43:29] <VanLynx> Yes there is no other
[1:43:30] <holis_crayolis> yes for the whole game
[1:43:30] <%JoshTheFace> yup
[1:43:30] <+trekkie11041> no style switching in 2
[1:43:31] <%TempestaDePrimo> Pokemon Pat & Pokemon PAige
[1:43:31] <%Ilpala271> pangoro
[1:43:32] <KeiPrime> theres only one style
[1:43:32] <Graywolf_the_45th> You use one style
[1:43:33] <WaxWitch> so Pokemon Dragon and Pokemon Oni?
[1:43:33] <%CerberusDriver> there are no styles in kiwami 2
[1:43:33] <ShreddingPixels> Yeah, that's your only style.
[1:43:34] <Basch71> you're using the Yakuza 6 style
[1:43:34] <EBT93> Yeah
[1:43:34] <$NocturneNovember> It's just the style from Yakuza 6
[1:43:35] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Weapon Style!
[1:43:37] <%sunset_soda> No style switching
[1:43:37] <%Toynota10> YUP
[1:43:40] <%alexandrecau> dragon engine from 6
[1:43:41] <%korth367> Dragon style the only style you play
[1:43:44] <%nocko_> @AngriestPat ITS DRAGON ENGINE COMBAT
[1:43:45] <%Solidnick18> you still get the stuff from 6
[1:43:45] <%badchoice5> Pokemon Chewie and Pokemon Fuckface
[1:43:45] <Komayeda> So, where are we right now storywise?
[1:43:46] <%LethargicRush> dragon style is like the big unlock on most the kiwami games i feel
[1:43:47] <%nocko_> FUCK 2
[1:43:52] <%OwlLightningMage> Dragon Style sucks in this game until you unlock the good skillls and speed upgrade
[1:43:53] <%galaxyswirl> FOR SICK HEAT MOVES
[1:43:54] <Tatrix912> Kiryu used smash
[1:43:55] <+kapcommunist> Pokemon X Fire Emblem Lance
[1:43:56] <+jkobe34> In this game you have to fight majima for dragon to be any good
[1:43:57] <%Edgy_Macaroon> yes it goes away from rush beast brawler
[1:43:59] <%nocko_> Feel the heat!
[1:44:00] <%Eaglestrike117> Trying to find haruka
[1:44:01] <$NocturneNovember> Also, never forget that Ryuji Goda was a pants thief in 1988
[1:44:01] <ShreddingPixels> I miss the style switching honestly, but 2 is still fun.
[1:44:01] <majindusto> Kiwami 2 is ONLY Dragon style
[1:44:02] <%vectorless_peon> Mook Con 19xx\
[1:44:04] <%DirtyGaijin> Don't make eye contact pat and then they can't challenge you
[1:44:04] <%ECRead> @SSaryn I also adore Emerald doodBro
[1:44:07] <%Eaglestrike117> Nishiki is about to him him with THE LINE
[1:44:10] <%nocko_> Dragon engine combat is shit
[1:44:11] <NumbusPlays> less rando goons, more Majima
[1:44:20] <$nitronLVIII> use a repel
[1:44:21] <frankcastle308> Ooo Dempsey
[1:44:23] <%jazzthezephyr> Date helps Kiryu murder for the sake of justice
[1:44:28] <%CerberusDriver> i like dragon engine combat..
[1:44:32] <%nocko_> I wish only 6 had it and all kiwami games used the 0 engine
[1:44:35] <WaxWitch> Majima-tan is taking a smoke break
[1:44:36] <@SSaryn> Hired gooooons
[1:44:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Kiryu WOKE UP TO JUSTICE
[1:44:50] <%CerberusDriver> Kiwami 2 looks amazing graphically
[1:44:53] <%Rust_Wick> nishkis goons
[1:44:57] <ShreddingPixels> Dragon Engine combat is alright it if a bit clumsy.
[1:44:58] <%nocko_> Oh yeah it looks great
[1:44:59] <+Jordan_z123> I think the dragon engine looks nice but combat switching is overall better
[1:45:00] <Komayeda> I don't think there is.
[1:45:01] <silvcrest> So much oppurtunity for my favorite heat action, completely avoided
[1:45:03] <%CerberusDriver> No, combat is great
[1:45:03] <%Solidnick18> it's fun
[1:45:04] <Prevot> it's limited as fuck in 6
[1:45:10] <%FrostMass22> I don't really like the gameplay of Kiwami 2
[1:45:11] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Its great
[1:45:14] <%starotter70> It's fun
[1:45:16] <%hawk_rush> GOONS
[1:45:18] <NotHereToStream> you can cheese the fuck out of enemies in kiwami 2
[1:45:19] <sphereshots12> !uptime
[1:45:20] <%Edgy_Macaroon> it's fine not as fluid
[1:45:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 45m.
[1:45:21] <%LethargicRush> pokemon goons
[1:45:21] <%nocko_> The combat limits what you can do super hard
[1:45:22] <Komayeda> Honestly, Kiwami 2 is my favorite of the series so far
[1:45:24] <EBT93> It’s great. It’s better than 6’s.
[1:45:25] <%DirtyGaijin> Has there been a release date for Kiwami 2 on pc?
[1:45:25] <+butch_deadlift> its just not very deep
[1:45:25] <omen_setter> it's fun to kick people across the street
[1:45:27] <%FrostMass22> Maybe I'll get used to it
[1:45:28] <%Solidnick18> 6 is the first dragon engine game so it's bare bones
[1:45:29] <bearwagon> its more ragdolly and the heat moves are more "based in reality" rather than over the top, but its still fun
[1:45:31] <Kingtut9009> Hey, Yakuza 6 didn't have big diminishing returns for Heat moves, makes it the best it my eyes
[1:45:31] <Jaller101514> its a lot more fluid
[1:45:35] <Komayeda> As a person who's only played 0, K1, and K2
[1:45:37] <ShreddingPixels> Sometimes the way enemies interact with the environment is a bit silly.
[1:45:38] <%hawk_rush> your partner's getting their ass kicked
[1:45:39] <%Solidnick18> 2 has alot more added
[1:45:39] <+Jordan_z123> Rag doll is the best
[1:45:40] <majindusto> ITS GREAT , whoever tells you otherwise is wrong
[1:45:41] <gamwthmou> it's a step forward from 6
[1:45:42] <omen_setter> Judge Eyes combat looks quite good
[1:45:42] <%nocko_> 2 has probably the best story
[1:45:43] <%starotter70> Bit on the easy side
[1:45:50] <%ScreamingMeat> I fucking love Kiryu's pose for Beast Mode in the corner. It's like a Jojo pose
[1:45:51] <%CerberusDriver> >heat moves based in reality did you even play kiwami 2
[1:45:52] <gamwthmou> the future looks bright for yakuza imo
[1:45:53] <Komayeda> I am SO getting Judgement
[1:45:55] <%CerberusDriver> theyre still nuts
[1:45:58] <Basch71> Judge Eyes use of the engine is great
[1:46:01] <%ECRead> i don't like having to play mahjong in K2
[1:46:05] <@SSaryn> I'd debate Kiwami 2 is more solid but also less consistent than the rest of the games.
[1:46:13] <%Ranryu692> Kiwami 2's combat is fun
[1:46:13] <StromkoPenguin> Can you just F off to the arcade and play sexy beetle fights?
[1:46:15] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Dragon Engine in 6 is stiff and lacking, K2 is better and weapons make up for its short comings imo, Judge Eyes is CRAZY
[1:46:17] <%TempestaDePrimo> :l
[1:46:17] <%Rust_Wick> did the one where kiryus a samurai get localized or nah?
[1:46:21] <+Jordan_z123> Judgement looks good
[1:46:21] <holis_crayolis> no first kiwam, 2
[1:46:23] <%Rust_Wick> i wanna play it
[1:46:24] <ShreddingPixels> Or you could just do 2 though.

[1:51:00] <JZPotter> Yakuza 0 is still the best one
[1:51:03] <%SergeEXE> ENERGY
[1:51:03] <%Typhaeon> However, it is not canon that Pat destroys these guys
[1:51:06] <%Swiglou> Its canon but crazy talk is creating an alternate reality
[1:51:06] <%badchoice5> To get the true ending you can't get bodied like this
[1:51:06] <+Ell1ot> save us redbull!

[1:54:47] <%NWR_James> Dodging is more effective than blocking in this one. Bullets dont hit hard but stun lock is a bitch
[1:54:48] <MasterBoris > wassup Pat? how you been?
[1:54:50] <yourliteraldog> Real Yakuza don't use guns
[1:54:52] <%DevilShadowQc> rgtWow

[1:54:57] <%badchoice5> @yoshkosh20 That's true, Kiryu doesn't kill, like a true Yakuzie!
[1:54:58] <+Tokanova> Jin
[1:54:58] <NumbusPlays> Oh
[1:54:58] <The_Sorrow_> D:
[1:54:59] <+miguelrod777> why didn't he shoot kiryu
[1:55:00] <%Niney_Who> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[1:55:00] <+Tokanova> Jin?
[1:55:01] <Gorgen> he missed

[1:55:04] <%Rust_Wick> JINPACHI
[1:55:05] <+timblenaut> CUTSCENE bullets!
[1:55:06] <%Fruitywhompus> this is so anime
[1:55:06] <simulationbard> Why not soot Kiryu
[1:55:07] <circular7> no
[1:55:07] <%JoshTheFace> welp
[1:55:08] <majindusto> No?
[1:55:08] <%TempestaDePrimo> Why the fuck is she still there?!
[1:55:09] <@SSaryn> Some were but I think this is the same
[1:55:09] <$Tuskor13> Slept through a damn gunshWAIT SHE GOT SHOT?!
[1:55:10] <Deano8817> I don't think so??
[1:55:12] <rosemon5001> crazy koreans
[1:55:12] <AdmiralButtloaf> could have shot kiryu lol
[1:55:13] <%Plague_Nurse> no
[1:55:14] <+IronPickle> Why not shoot Kyru?
[1:55:15] <+Ell1ot> why didn't he just shoot the Kiriu?
[1:55:17] <Basch71> this was in the original
[1:55:17] <+sixcubit> why does everyone shoot their goons and never kiryu
[1:55:18] <%brave_sj> It was made more extreme
[1:55:18] <%CerberusDriver> shooting Kiryu is pointless
[1:55:18] <%Swiglou> What a tough baby
[1:55:18] <%DK_Rance> @aimlesshealer its a hit like any other its just at a range so it can really mess up your combos if your not careful and pop the gun guys
[1:55:19] <Ner234> This kid is tough
[1:55:20] <%LethargicRush> wow shes tough for taking a bullet to the arm
[1:55:22] <%alexandrecau> no your memory is shit pat
[1:55:23] <Silversunburst> wait why didn't they shoot the Kiry
[1:55:27] <%CerberusDriver> Kiryu shrugs off bullets constantly
[1:55:27] <$imextremelymanly> damn this girl is crazy tough
[1:55:28] <RudraShintaro> You could’ve shot kiryu
[1:55:28] <alwayspronking> Nono, Koreans are the next game
[1:55:29] <%XzileGaming> the gunshot only stunned her
[1:55:31] <HefestoForges> shoot the yakuza boi
[1:55:32] <%D33TR> kiryu can only be hurt by knives not bullets
[1:55:34] <GUNxSPECTRE> Guys, they SHOT a fucking kid
[1:55:35] <%MagickBurritoh> Kiryu shrugs bullets off
[1:55:42] <+JackMillerTime> dude was gonna tell em who they were, cant have that
[1:55:42] <Nautilus_Bot> your mom is omae wa mo shinderu
[1:55:44] <%NWR_James> Shooting Kiryu is actually less than pointless. It makes him angrier
[1:55:44] <cumurasame> no they were going to say "Jinghu"
[1:55:45] <Hellarussian> BIG sad
[1:55:45] <%Plague_Nurse> I think he shoots himself in the original
[1:55:45] <+Tokanova> oh right the koreans
[1:55:46] <%mayorrev> shindeiru
[1:55:46] <blue6sub6remnant6> Shouldn't we be giving the child medical attention?

[1:55:52] <+Ell1ot> Pat, how come he shot his buddy instead of you?
[1:55:53] <Twin_Hallow> bullets arent as strong in this world
[1:55:53] <%FrostMass22> Why didn't Jango Fett kill Obi-Wan with his poison dart when he had the chance?

[1:56:36] <withguac> Fun fact : most Koreans in Japan are descendants of slave laborers and comfort women from the war, and also aren’t allowed to vote :)
[1:56:38] <frankcastle308> Kyru has a anti death affect like d4c
[1:56:39] <%LogothX> I love how Kiryu always has a scowl on his face
[1:56:42] <+Blankets_and_Tea> jingweon isn't in 1 at all
[1:56:42] <Mrthepastyrider> You think holding that look for hours on end makes Kiryu's face hurt?
[1:56:44] <hung_tu_long_fong> Real yakuza don't need to use guns (most of the time) because they have enough violent power even without them, it's just easier that way for them.
[1:56:45] <+timblenaut> id tagged bodies in id tagged crime families
[1:56:50] <+Dagman72> so we just gonna ignore her getting shot and not going to the hospital LMAO

[1:57:40] <%shiplord13> Kiryu this seems like a bad idea..
[1:57:41] <shmupdogjoe> Why bother with the fuss and muss of toggling safeties, reloading, etc, when you can just grab any random piece of signage or piece of lumber or tea kettle off the side of the street to murder people for so much cheaper?
[1:57:42] <%NWR_James> No gods or kings, only fat dudes in an untied robe
[1:57:42] <%SpamKingRathalos> tv and a nice bed?

[2:21:42] <shmupdogjoe> I would say lungs are way less sexy than feet. If you see lungs the reaction is always "woah, those aren't supposed to be on the outside"

[2:22:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten I ain't no DD and I'm at home
[2:22:48] <shmupdogjoe> @Valdorick you still shouldn't be seeing lungs because those aren't part of the digestive tract. Double-check matey mate mate
[2:22:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat go have a friendly chat with your kyodai!
[2:22:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> HIT THE BACC
[2:22:50] <%DirtyGaijin> Stone cold stunner into bed
[2:22:50] <Tucker0603> peed on paig e?!?
[2:22:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Did you kissed her good night
[2:22:53] <xtremegamer80> Did you touch her with a foot?
[2:22:57] <flame_of_udun_> Piss baby mad
[2:22:57] <Shadicara> He put Paige to bed, so he killed her?
[2:23:07] <talisign> Did you not feed her ham?
[2:23:15] <Valdorick> @shmupdogjoe fuck, I've been bamboozled.
[2:23:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> healthy boi
[2:23:21] <person181> can never go wrong with more health
[2:23:24] <%badchoice5> Does Paige have a Sleep Noise to go with the fabled Pee Noise?
[2:23:30] <+TastySammiches> Elmo seethes with the fury of a raging sun
[2:23:30] <WaxWitch> a choke hold is more a put to sleep move LUL
[2:23:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> maybe
[2:23:41] <%badchoice5> Block who?
[2:23:47] <%mayorrev> b a k a n a
[2:23:49] <Shadicara> No need pat defense would only make haruka more disappointed in you
[2:23:51] <person181> nah just keep hitting them
[2:23:56] <%Dagman72> B A K A
[2:23:59] <%Solidnick18> blocking is lame
[2:24:00] <%DirtyGaijin> Paige hums the McDonalds Jingle in her sleep
[2:24:03] <majindusto> Blocking is for chumps
[2:24:03] <%lloyddboy> As I have told insects 1000 times
[2:24:04] <%badchoice5> Don't block Cliffy B, we all enjoy that
[2:24:06] <person181> they can't kill you if they're dead
[2:24:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Parrying involves blocking Pat
[2:24:09] <+TastySammiches> don't block in rush mode, dodge
[2:24:11] <%Dagman72> Blocking is for plebs
[2:24:12] <SeventyForce> Drop ya shield know what I'ma sayin???
[2:24:13] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you don't need to I beat the game without blocking
[2:24:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:24:40] <%Mornaka> Blocking is for paraplegics that cant dodge
[2:24:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You really do need to if you're going to 100% the game or play on Hard/EX-Hard.
[2:24:43] <%frugglemeister> Gottem
[2:24:50] <%laserbeaming> You are not blocking because you want to be playing DMC 5 instead
[2:24:52] <%DirtyGaijin> rob the innocent
[2:24:57] <ImportunoDiz> Why do these New Rich people love to pick fights
[2:25:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just kill this man that has money
[2:25:03] <%Solidnick18> that otg lol
[2:25:04] <%badchoice5> Not rich enough for some Karate lessons, huh?
[2:25:04] <leargo> why ?
[2:25:04] <+dyedeme> I don't think I blocked a single time in Zero or Kiwami jenjaThinking
[2:25:08] <flame_of_udun_> Free piggy bank
[2:25:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Doesnt tiger Drop require you to parry
[2:25:15] <Shadicara> 5 days lads till Devil May Cry 5 Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:25:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But the block parries!
[2:25:18] <%Dagman72> Blocking is for the weak
[2:25:25] <+TastySammiches> blocking is super good in brawler mode tho
[2:25:25] <DrMoose7> Kiryu can tank it
[2:25:29] <WaxWitch> they give you extra money or something?
[2:25:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Blocking is super good though.
[2:25:30] <Rincewind1998> Beast gets a ton of moves out of resist guard
[2:25:30] <%yoshkosh20> @dirtygaijin that guy ain't innocent. he has commited the crime of bad fashion.
[2:25:36] <$imextremelymanly> you don't need to dodging is way better
[2:25:37] <%OwlLightningMage> blocking is super good though
[2:25:41] <%Gogogolem> Woolie only blocks in this game
[2:25:43] <%XzileGaming> and thast why you got your ass beat by GUN man
[2:25:45] <%Mornaka> Just block with your chin
[2:25:51] <%Solidnick18> i used block abunch in fist of the northstar
[2:25:52] <%gus_hornblende> @AngriestPat I felt like they made blocking much more important in 6, and I kind of liked ity
[2:25:55] <+JackMillerTime> why block when you can punch
[2:25:55] <ShreddingPixels> It's not royal guard.
[2:25:55] <Shadicara> Just pop your devil trigger and you don't need to block
[2:25:59] <person181> just kill them faster then they can kill you
[2:26:00] <xtremegamer80> Has the Pepsiman commercials come out around the time this game takes place?
[2:26:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Royalguard
[2:26:02] <%badchoice5> Blocking is for people who lack confidence in their killing
[2:26:03] <%laserbeaming> So, you can't cancel your sting with a block?
[2:26:03] <AdmiralButtloaf> who needs blocking when you have energy drinks
[2:26:04] <%Agami23> the best defense is an unstoppable offence
[2:26:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> I never seem more people willing to get crippled then yakuzaverse
[2:26:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Just get the block moves that do counter punches out of a block for big damage and heat.
[2:26:08] <Kingtut9009> Blocking doesn't matter, just stack your inventory with healing items and go to town
[2:26:14] <%Ion_LaserX> apatPorgmo
[2:26:14] <%lloyddboy> apatPorgmo
[2:26:15] <+TastySammiches> blocking is a good way to build heat in brawler mode
[2:26:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Elml is angry
[2:26:17] <%MaxonMashville> get good and you don't need to block
[2:26:17] <%DirtyGaijin> The best defence is a good offence
[2:26:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes just hanging out LUL
[2:26:24] <+TastySammiches> smoke break
[2:26:24] <xtremegamer80> Cus I swear I heard Pepsiman
[2:26:28] <%Solidnick18> oh majima
[2:26:32] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[2:26:32] <%ElenaManetta> sees majima GETS INTO FIGHT POSE
[2:26:35] <%yoshkosh20> cranky old man
[2:26:35] <flame_of_udun_> LUL
[2:26:36] <%mayorrev> oh hey majima
[2:26:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Kingtut9009 That's so lame. I only ever carry 3 healing items at a time.
[2:26:40] <%kiiiirsten> Tiem to fuckfight
[2:26:40] <%DirtyGaijin> he sounded haunting
[2:26:42] <%Solidnick18> he's on break
[2:26:42] <xtremegamer80> @ElenaManetta Wouldn't you?
[2:26:57] <faegbeard> he's still a bitch though
[2:26:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Time to meet Fish Friend
[2:27:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> how would date know?
[2:27:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This is going to go so well.
[2:27:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ojisan
[2:27:05] <%kiiiirsten> Wait here in this hobo camp while I get drunk, kid
[2:27:07] <%alexandrecau> Stay in the hobo camp little girl or I'll slap you
[2:27:09] <SeventyForce> Go kill meh DAD
[2:27:12] <flame_of_udun_> This sounds like a swell idea
[2:27:12] <%shiplord13> Haruka knows Nishki is a loser
[2:27:14] <%Mornaka> Out of all the words for Nishki, capable is NOT one of them
[2:27:15] <person181> don't use it
[2:27:16] <%Edgy_Macaroon> Rush dodging is better than block
[2:27:20] <%alexandrecau> Don't block just weave rush style
[2:27:23] <%Solidnick18> hmmm
[2:27:25] <Shadicara> Time to smash nishki's teeth in
[2:27:27] <%alexandrecau> or learn parry
[2:27:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you get the brawler block+triangle counter then you can dominate with blocking.
[2:27:29] <%shiplord13> Nishki is incapable Date
[2:27:43] <%alexandrecau> Date is incapable Date
[2:27:43] <+Blankets_and_Tea> rush made blocking useless. yet another reason why i don't like styles being added to kiwami
[2:27:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dragon Style's Tiger Drop remains the best counter though and that's from a lock-on not a block.
[2:27:54] <%laserbeaming> just switch to Royal Guard and parry Kappa
[2:27:55] <aimlesshealer> Where did the shrubbery go??
[2:27:56] <Basch71> you're basically waiting for an opening in their attacks when you're blocking
[2:27:58] <%XzileGaming> if u get attacked, start holding block, worked n Yakuza 0 because of Re-Guard
[2:28:01] <flame_of_udun_> Can’t you play as Date in this game lol
[2:28:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:28:06] <talisign> The best offense is a good fuck it
[2:28:08] <$imextremelymanly> best offense is more offense
[2:28:10] <%alexandrecau> no you can't
[2:28:11] <aimlesshealer> Did he shove the entire thing in his mouth?
[2:28:11] <Rincewind1998> Beast gets five separate moves that can only be used from a block stance, and they're super good
[2:28:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Best defense is a good offense
[2:28:11] <%Dagman72> Best defense is energy drink
[2:28:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @AngriestPat For the longest time I thought Nishiki was Haruka's dad and no one just wanted to talk about it past Yakuza 1 because spoilers.
[2:28:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Blocking is more useful because of how it builds heat.
[2:28:20] <WaxWitch> try that again LUL
[2:28:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just preemptive strike the world
[2:28:24] <%DirtyGaijin> just offence all day every day
[2:28:28] <%px120> wanna try that again?
[2:28:33] <%DirtyGaijin> nuke the world from orbit
[2:28:33] <SeventyForce> Best offense is a best offense
[2:28:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Re-Guard is in tech.
[2:28:36] <+ArcanumMBD> So I never played an yakuzie, the games never really appealed to me. But for some reason the private detective crime drama setting of Judge Eyes is doing a better job of getting me interested.
[2:28:37] <+dyedeme> Time you spend blocking is time you aren't crippling criminals during
[2:28:38] <%yoshkosh20> when I played I just started weaving and blocking after i did a combo. just tried to always be on the move. also used rush alot.
[2:28:43] <%Starlight_Gamer> So style system wasn’t in the original yakuza?
[2:28:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just invade countries before they invade you the Roman way
[2:28:45] <+dyedeme> Doesn't seem worth it to me
[2:28:54] <+TastySammiches> go for the attack ups
[2:28:55] <Basch71> its in tech
[2:28:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> keep boosting health
[2:29:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Starlight_Gamer No, it is only in Kiwami 1 and Yakuza 0.
[2:29:02] <+Blankets_and_Tea> @Starlight_Gamer styles weren't in the series until 0
[2:29:04] <%XzileGaming> someone said its in TECH in Kiwami
[2:29:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Fucking reguard only works in beast anyway
[2:29:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's in TECH.
[2:29:13] <+Katmon27> ay its the kiwamers
[2:29:18] <%yoshkosh20> then I unlcoked most of dragon style and just tiger dropped everybody.
[2:29:22] <%kiiiirsten> Where is the mustard queen
[2:29:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> in bed
[2:29:31] <Shadicara> Nah I think they added it for continuity sake?
[2:29:33] <%kiiiirsten> kiwami means pay attention to the chat
[2:29:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @fruit_pie_the_magician What? No. It works in Brawler, Rush, and Dragon. Beast is the only one it doesn't work in.
[2:29:37] <%DirtyGaijin> Spreading mustard everywhere
[2:29:39] <Axonn1018> Time for godspeed PogChamp
[2:29:40] <%alexandrecau> just wait for dragon defense moves
[2:29:51] <King___Crimson> Elboe crush is the true ultimate defense
[2:30:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> See you need to guard LUL
[2:30:08] <+TastySammiches> every style has a reguard
[2:30:10] <%alexandrecau> tiger drop is the ultimate defense
[2:30:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Re-guard is different from floating re-guard that's why.
[2:30:20] <%alexandrecau> expecially in this game it's so easy
[2:30:26] <waifoong98> Join the ROYALGUARD ye pleb LUL
[2:30:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If I'm honest I never blocked in any of the yakuza games except in the tutorial for blocking
[2:30:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Oh my god he switched right off of it.
[2:30:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> NotLikeThis
[2:30:42] <Deano8817> you probably already ahve it
[2:30:46] <%Mornaka> Just do a Luffy and shield yourself in a wall of punch
[2:30:49] <+Katmon27> tiger drop is so fun
[2:30:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> > not learning Royalguard Kappa
[2:31:01] <Prevot> you shouldn't be struggling, you're not even on hard mode
[2:31:06] <+TastySammiches> EMLO
[2:31:09] <Basch71> blocking is basically required on hard mode
[2:31:09] <Shadicara> Just punch them harder
[2:31:11] <silvcrest> I'm only going to read the parts of chat that agree with me!
[2:31:12] <+RushUnplugged> only worth blocking in Brawler because of the counters
[2:31:13] <%Ion_LaserX> apatWink
[2:31:16] <person181> i know i used block as beast that's for sure
[2:31:21] <aimlesshealer> I want a bust of elmo

[2:31:35] <leargo> catss are crancky
[2:31:36] <%XzileGaming> blocking is honestly a good way to build heat, and look bad ass cause you do the big heat all the time
[2:31:38] <$cureneckbeard> emlo
[2:31:42] <+Katmon27> i never used beast when i played
[2:31:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And Beast has 3 seperate counters out of block.

[2:52:43] <MetalDeerS0LID> pachinko!
[2:52:45] <ShichiNoBushi> Low... profile.
[2:52:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Shit's on fire yo.
[2:52:51] <lionmanguy> The doctor did?
[2:52:52] <omen_setter> I wonder how Kiryu would have handled that situation
[2:52:53] <reinbachthe3rd> Goons!
[2:53:00] <%badchoice5> I feel like Nishiki should be able to easily use that money literally anywhere in the world to get the operation
[2:53:00] <%Shindeil> This IS low profile.
[2:53:01] <+HeyBoston> please beat up these goons while also running from the cops
[2:53:01] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Keep a low profile! *proceeds to bash into women on the street*
[2:53:03] <%Plague_Nurse> JFC PAT
[2:53:07] <Joestar1890> Low profile...TIME TO BEAT UP SOME GOONS!
[2:53:07] <%alexandrecau> @rdark_ksu because he doesn't know any other willing to find a dude's organ
[2:53:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> boost health
[2:53:09] <3xgilly> """"""""Low Profile""""""""
[2:53:16] <+HeyBoston> whoa big exp
[2:53:19] <agadejobi> Kiryu would have beaten up the doctor's debtors and gotten the operation for free
[2:53:19] <%Eaglestrike117> I believe what the doctor was describing was a back room surgery using black market organs, cause his sister wasnt gonna live long enough to do it the legal way
[2:53:25] <%Nobrev> get them even if you dont want them because it's better than just getting nothing @AngriestPat
[2:53:27] <%SaltyDongs> Flash step
[2:53:29] <serrule1> Hey Pat! Have you watched any of that OWE wrestling?
[2:53:33] <%MelBrooksKA> Ironically, all Nishki would have had to do was find out about debt and wipe it out as trade for fixing up his sister
[2:53:42] <%MelBrooksKA> the debt*
[2:53:45] <agadejobi> Oh, of course. If she needs organs real bad, then it'd have to be back room shit
[2:53:51] <agadejobi> Not like this is Policenaughts
[2:53:52] <%yoshkosh20> Nishki dumb as hell
[2:53:55] <%KaironFortressKnight> Pat, you should switch styles faster, like TRICKSWORDGUN
[2:53:56] <flame_of_udun_> @melbrookska too bad the doctor never told him about it
[2:53:59] <WaxWitch> with that money he could have probably gotten the operation overseas or am i crazy?
[2:54:00] <3xgilly> heyyyyy
[2:54:01] <+HeyBoston> time for GODSPEED
[2:54:13] <%DK_Rance> break the leg
[2:54:16] <%maskedriderhero> @melbrookska He was never going to fix his sister, it was a scam to get the money

[2:54:47] <%alexandrecau> @WaxWitch it's not about money, it's about killing a dude to get their organ more or less, it's as much as finding the right guy than having the money
[2:54:51] <+mugwugsampoo> @angriestpat Have you discussed the new episode of JoJo yet?
[2:54:54] <%MelBrooksKA> @maskedriderhero Then he could have scamed him into breaking his legs?

[3:10:57] <Jrockoni> can kiryu out style switch Dante?
[3:11:02] <Futurecity10> Majima dies like 5 times in this game
[3:11:03] <%OwlLightningMage> Majima is an Enhancer after all
[3:11:04] <%badchoice5> Plus, Kiryu would NEVER kill someone
[3:11:05] <%lloyddboy> it hit the eyepatch guys he's fine
[3:11:06] <+supahrob64> Goro Majima, the same man who can teleport behi- OH SHHIT
[3:11:08] <%DirtyGaijin> Majima and Kiryu are superhuman
[3:11:08] <krymzen5> majimas goes by gag character rules
[3:11:09] <Deano8817> Majima ate a baseball in a canon cutscene so he's EXTRA immortal
[3:11:10] <a_mad_dragon> majima is the second-strongest person in japan
[3:11:11] <KeiPrime> it would kill any normal man but the one thing you have to remember is majima is not normal
[3:11:12] <Smaenus> "Man why did the boss go crazy?" Smash cut to Kiryu pounding Majima's skull in like 700 times
[3:11:12] <dekkitout> He shrugged of a stabbing, Majima is a sturdy fella.
[3:11:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> Majima is so strong losing his eye was just the universe corecting how strong it made him

[3:11:26] <%Keyd00d> When will Majima become a virtual youtuber

[3:13:58] <dekkitout> God, Majima doing capoeira is art
[3:14:02] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Is this fujoshi?
[3:14:04] <%DirtyGaijin> This really is just Flirting with these two
[3:14:07] <%ItsKitKat_> Remember guy kiru doesn't murder, just maim
[3:14:08] <+TastySammiches> get some brass knucks pat
[3:14:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat you can do a lot of damage if you play better lol.
[3:14:12] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> The problem is that Majima post 0 isn't quite grounded enough to be an MC, they'd have to either tone him down or make the scenario serious enough for him to get real
[3:14:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Do some heat moves dude.
[3:14:16] <%ElenaManetta> I'm going to the store to get apple juice
[3:14:19] <silverira> early entrys you did more damage
[3:14:21] <Dhurkst> @dekkitout It's actually breakdancing, lol
[3:14:22] <lizard0tm> They're flirting with their fist
[3:14:22] <%ElenaManetta> Tell me all the cool stuff Pat does when I get back, chat
[3:14:26] <%MattDemers> @Unlimited_Coffee_Works He's kinda been turned into funneee meme man
[3:14:26] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat you need to do Colosseum more
[3:14:29] <Prevot> Kiryu is only tough cause he can chug redbulls in the stopped time
[3:14:31] <omen_setter> these enemies can eat tons of spicy food and not even feel it
[3:14:31] <Huntercd> Is Majima playable?
[3:14:32] <%IDTheftVictim> flirsting
[3:14:33] <$ooblagis> Tiger Drop does a lot of damage. I really can't stress enough how much Tiger Drop dumps on Majima
[3:14:33] <%Trtickster> Ok, but why is Majima so fucking cool tho?
[3:14:34] <WaxWitch> hospitalization isn't murder guys
[3:14:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I'll tell you now; none @ElenaManetta
[3:14:43] <%DirtyGaijin> @ElenaManetta hah "cool"
[3:14:48] <%Edgy_Macaroon> always dodge you get heat way faster that way
[3:14:53] <+HeyBoston> pls stop healing
[3:14:53] <+TastySammiches> ora ora
[3:14:56] <$ooblagis> Tiger Drop
[3:14:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Colisseum is how you get more Komaki training Pat. Which is how Dragon Style gets good.
[3:14:57] <KeiPrime> tiger drop is game breaker
[3:14:59] <ZatsuHimura> For Komaki
[3:15:01] <Deano8817> ORA ORA ORA ORA
[3:15:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Tiger Drop is by far the best thing in the world.
[3:15:08] <+zaworldo> Build that t r a i n i n g from Komaki
[3:15:09] <+RushUnplugged> you get training from Komaki to unlock more dragon boosts

[3:15:14] <$RaikenTB> 極
[3:15:15] <majindusto> Majima just Styling all over your balls!
[3:15:16] <%OwlLightningMage> Tiger drop is so fucking busted LUL
[3:15:17] <Smaenus> Tiger Drop makes the game a joke
[3:15:17] <+AhmCha> Coliseum gives you extra moves, including one that just trivializes the game
[3:15:19] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> What are the onlookers thinking seeing Majima and Kiryu fucking dashing around like anime characters in this street fight? LUL LUL
[3:15:21] <ZatsuHimura> Majima just dies in 3 or 4 Tiger drops
[3:15:21] <%Plague_Nurse> That's no fun
[3:15:24] <$ooblagis> Tiger Drop is unlocked through the colloseum, and Tiger Drop melts health bars
[3:15:24] <+zaworldo> tiger drop does INSANE damage @AngriestPat
[3:15:25] <UltraBulldozer> yeah tiger drop op
[3:15:26] <+TastySammiches> tiger drop is the strongest move in the game yeah
[3:15:27] <+Forticon> Tiger Drop is the single strongest attack in the game and it's a counterattack
[3:15:27] <%startadevy> cohhBeer
[3:15:30] <%Cthulos> tiger drop is great. Do you get that early in Kiwami or is it end game?
[3:15:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @couch_potato_Ed_Boy They're thinking it's Wednesday.
[3:15:33] <DaringOcelot> I LOVE how Majima uses his Yakuza 0 stances
[3:15:34] <Smaenus> It's like that busted knife counter Majima gets in Zero
[3:15:36] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> @MattDemers He was funny meme man even in the original tho
[3:15:38] <Dhurkst> damn, majima
[3:15:38] <%lloyddboy> Kiwami means listening to chat's advice
[3:15:41] <%OwlLightningMage> It's the best move in the game by far
[3:15:42] <%startadevy> apatPat pastaThat
[3:15:44] <%aivalera> It really is
[3:15:48] <+HeyBoston> served served served
[3:15:49] <%ItsKitKat_> I feel like majima has access to some cloning device, and each clone dies after every fight. also explains majima everywhere
[3:15:50] <%MattDemers> @Unlimited_Coffee_Works Eh, I don't think to the same degree.
[3:15:52] <+TastySammiches> @Cthulos its tied to sidequest stuff so it's pretty much endgame
[3:15:53] <xtremegamer80> Last I saw Kiryu fought a bunch shortly after getting a phone call, what did I miss?
[3:15:55] <%bread_assassin> Just imagine Majima's knife counter from 0.
[3:15:56] <King___Crimson> You need to learn the essence of jolt countering dudes in the balls
[3:15:57] <KeiPrime> when you get it in kiwami 2 tho, god damn
[3:15:58] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @Too_Much_Nukie Yea, you're right. LUL LUL
[3:16:01] <Deano8817> I'm so sad they nerf the tiger drop to shit after this game
[3:16:01] <%Edgy_Macaroon> tiger drop + rush for heat
[3:16:04] <omen_setter> Majima's breaker style is so fucking good
[3:16:04] <dekkitout> Look at these two surging sexual auras clashing against one another
[3:16:13] <fIashman92> Isn't there a lock on function?
[3:16:17] <%CerberusDriver> what is with chat
[3:16:18] <%Cthulos> You get tiger drop super early in Y3 and 5
[3:16:23] <%CerberusDriver> Majima and Kiryu aren't GAY
[3:16:23] <%kiiiirsten> Eat bike, miscreant!
[3:16:25] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @xtremegamer80 he fought a bunch after talking to nishiki and went to the batting cages
[3:16:31] <%ItsKitKat_> ORA
[3:16:33] <KeiPrime> steel sharpens steel
[3:16:35] <Gorgen> ora ora ora
[3:16:36] <$ooblagis> This around the point Majima fights start lasting a long time, and why Tiger Drop starts being less about breaking the game, and more about keeping the game fun
[3:16:37] <%XzileGaming> did u really just tell Majima to calm down, GIOOD FUCKING LUCK
[3:16:41] <bigbradish> DId he just ORA?
[3:16:42] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Even if he doesn't get his own game Majima deserves to be at least an unlockable or something, his movesets are crazy
[3:16:43] <%mastertwin2> So this is what it must have been like for the dudes getting style-beasted by Majima in 0
[3:16:45] <%startadevy> PinkMercy imGlitch
[3:16:53] <WaxWitch> I actually heard Ora
[3:16:54] <Deano8817> okay but imagine walking down the street and you see an eyepatch man break dance through a suit man slamming a fucking bycicle down on him
[3:16:55] <AzirothTheGreat> did you know you can break majima's ai in this game?
[3:16:57] <%ItsKitKat_> Majima is the josuke of this universe
[3:16:57] <%kiiiirsten> BIG ass
[3:16:58] <xtremegamer80> @ThatGuyfromMars So business as usual?

[3:17:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No.
[3:17:30] <AdmiralButtloaf> he wasnt unlocked before?
[3:17:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> no?
[3:17:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> bike style is the fuckng strong
[3:17:35] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> These onlookers are also looking at a man swinging around a fucking bicycle and the other man doing break dance moves while being slammed in the face by the bicycle. LUL LUL
[3:17:38] <%DirtyGaijin> You would think bike sales would have declined with Kiryu around
[3:17:39] <%startadevy> ThankEgg
[3:17:42] <omen_setter> one of the best parts of the dragon engine in Kiwami 2 is the ability to throw people into the stores and restaurants
[3:17:46] <+HeyBoston> 'a trip

[3:19:04] <%px120> Man, it's a shame that game sold like garbage

[3:19:07] <Prevot> I would definitely never watch it

[3:19:10] <%DirtyGaijin> Ive really enjoyed what ive played of Pillars 2
[3:19:11] <+InkblotBlues> 1
[3:19:12] <%starotter70> I'd watch like the first 10 mins
[3:19:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Liar suckups LUL
[3:19:13] <suikudo> 1
[3:19:13] <%Spydurman> His views always tank during Pillars
[3:19:13] <%WheatlyXT> At least 3 people wanna watch it Pat!
[3:19:13] <%BestTeaMaker> 1
[3:19:15] <count_bob> Pat, the reasons your old Pillars stream didn't get viewers was because you were still bad at streaming.
[3:19:15] <DraxTD> well @AngriestPat , I mostly just like watching you and your comendary.. but I can't lie I like yakuza morre =P
[3:19:16] <Ner234> Always sometimes never trust chat.
[3:19:17] <%Demon_Shadow4> I never played it so im interested
[3:19:18] <NumbusPlays> I wouldn't watch it, to be honest.
[3:19:18] <%WheatlyXT> 1
[3:19:21] <+LowBatteryLife> I will watch anything but that shit.
[3:19:25] <caol2017> Pat we're all waiting for the hype shogi parlor gameplay
[3:19:25] <pectusumbra> I would watch it if it was on during earlier hours
[3:19:25] <%violetheart> Heck you, Pat. I *did* watch those old Pillars videos.
[3:19:27] <WaxWitch> Big Lie
[3:19:28] <tmix1600> I dont watch that
[3:19:28] <%badchoice5> I'd watch a Pillars stream. Just not, you know, much of it
[3:19:29] <%king_wragles> I watched it the last time you played @AngriestPat
[3:19:31] <%BestTeaMaker> guess what, I'm part of the FE#13000
[3:19:31] <%XzileGaming> stream Pillars, and watch the same people go PLAY YAKUZA, PLAY ACE COMBAT, PLAY MHW
[3:19:35] <Bouldus> TBF i watched it all as vods
[3:19:36] <%Rngiddion> real talk I would not watch it
[3:19:36] <%OwlLightningMage> But what about the second one you shit
[3:19:37] <Deano8817> I'd use it as a sleep aid to be honest LUL
[3:19:38] <+HeyBoston> going right now!
[3:19:38] <%Spydurman> Pillars rarely broke 600 viewers
[3:19:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Why is chat such a bunch of liars?
[3:19:41] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat fuck you I liked watching that
[3:19:42] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> well play tyranny then bitch
[3:19:43] <malletman241> pillars is so boring
[3:19:44] <%Demon_Shadow4> pat i'd watch anything you play lol
[3:19:44] <Bouldus> but i really enjoyed pillars
[3:19:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> right behind ur face
[3:19:47] <TheBigO75> Dude you were still grossing 1000 viewers back then
[3:19:47] <%MisterRockett> Is that why we never came back to Tactics?
[3:19:49] <Psyramics> i couldn't stick around for 10 hour streams that started at 10pm
[3:19:49] <dekkitout> *Aside for it's inception tajC
[3:19:50] <MahoganyWoods> People barely tolerated pat talking about Baulders Gate on the Podcast.
[3:19:52] <+Mittensbro> holy shit you're 100% right
[3:19:53] <BananaSurgery> yeah 10 minutes into making your character I bailed super hard
[3:19:54] <%snow_bush> That man is dead now
[3:19:54] <pectusumbra> And pillars 2 looks WAY cooler than 1. One is generic fantasy. 2 is pirate fantasy with actual cool people right from the start
[3:19:55] <$RaikenTB> not dead
[3:19:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> TRUTH
[3:19:56] <Huntercd> That man is dead
[3:19:57] <%starotter70> yup
[3:20:02] <%king_wragles> 1
[3:20:03] <%xemnahort> @angriestpat it’s not my fault you always streamed pillars when I was unavailable
[3:20:06] <%gus_hornblende> @AngriestPat ey! That little bit got me to actually play and love the game
[3:20:11] <%px120> Pretty much, yeah
[3:20:12] <%MagickBurritoh> But stream it though
[3:20:12] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat We will literally watch almost anything, and the people who watch the Pillars playthrough, are the loyalest of us all
[3:20:13] <+LowBatteryLife> Basically you're the worst streamer ever and I hate anything you play after ten minutes.
[3:20:14] <majindusto> That drug store...GONE IN YAKUZA 6
[3:20:15] <%Plague_Nurse> So every souls stream that isn't someone getting into the series?
[3:20:16] <Mrthepastyrider> why do random packs of tiny goons not just run from Kiryu on sight?
[3:20:16] <DonatelloJose> I was not a fan honestly
[3:20:18] <%camodikk> anyone have any knowledge of why poe2 takes so friggin long to load?
[3:20:21] <%Spydurman> 500
[3:20:23] <redial_nick> yeah buy drugs from soujiro!
[3:20:25] <$nademonkey1100> i was actually watching the vods since i missed it
[3:20:25] <%aivalera> So it’s angriestpat’s Tokyo Mirage Sessions
[3:20:26] <faegbeard> then they just alt-tab and leave it open while watching porn or something
[3:20:29] <DRAGKUDO> where's Elmo?
[3:20:30] <aimlesshealer> I'm watching that on YT right now!
[3:20:30] <%bread_assassin> PoE is a game I want to get into, but I just don't get those kind of RPGs.
[3:20:30] <%badchoice5> @AngriestPat Through no fault of yours, your Pillars stream made me less interested in the game personally. That's the worst possible way to consume it.
[3:20:33] <%DirtyGaijin> 2?
[3:20:33] <%Spydurman> He average 900-1000 back then
[3:20:37] <+Anonymasque> "Pillars of Eternity"? Just the title alone makes me sleepy. I think Pat's right.
[3:20:40] <$RaikenTB> Just go back to retail if you want to stream pillars LUL
[3:20:41] <%XzileGaming> i hated watching pillars
[3:20:42] <tmix1600> Binding of issac was kind of hard for me. Pillars is not gonna happen
[3:20:43] <%DK_Rance> so what?
[3:20:46] <+LowBatteryLife> And that's /with/ watching porn in another tab.
[3:20:46] <lizard0tm> Okay, but half is literally better than nothing
[3:20:49] <%mr_slaide> Those people are morons.
[3:20:51] <%OwlLightningMage> What about the Second one though. SwiftRage
[3:20:51] <autismtank> lol just checked twitch tracker and you have 94% of all yakuza kiwami viewers
[3:20:52] <+HeyBoston> average viewers on pillars = 549
[3:21:02] <%Rngiddion> guys thats how you kill your stream
[3:21:02] <MahoganyWoods> Anyone know if there are D&D or Tabletop video games that are actually turn based and grid based?
[3:21:05] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Speaking of pillars, is the PS4 load time really that bad?
[3:21:07] <aimlesshealer> There's nothing flashy to look at, all the fun is playing it yourself
[3:21:09] <%Spydurman> Because he has to pay his bills chat
[3:21:10] <%Spydurman> 3
[3:21:11] <Djinnazz> It does, just have to do it right.
[3:21:16] <%DedlokPM> I would totally skip the Pillars of Eternity streams just like I skip the Fallout New Vegas streams apatWhat
[3:21:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yakuza > Pillars
[3:21:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:21:19] <%TheNewJapanGuy> NICE
[3:21:20] <%badchoice5> You need something wet and sloppy for streaming
[3:21:20] <%laserbeaming> LUL
[3:21:23] <%Plague_Nurse> Congrats
[3:21:24] <dekkitout> Monopolized!
[3:21:25] <%Spydurman> LUL
[3:21:25] <%px120> GODDAMN
[3:21:25] <WaxWitch> Yakuza is the shit tho
[3:21:26] <DraxTD> WE ALL HERE!!
[3:21:29] <Deano8817> YUP HE DOES RIGHT NOW LUL
[3:21:30] <%violetheart> It doesn't work very well with streaming since it's quite slow, but it's a *great* game and I'd love to see you play it again, even if I understand the reasons not to.
[3:21:31] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you are yakuza king tho
[3:21:33] <%OwlLightningMage> No one cares about Yakuza BibleThump
[3:21:33] <%BestTeaMaker> I would imagine DOS2 is a much better stream game considering there's constant voice acting and the combat is a lot more digestible to viewers
[3:21:34] <alwayspronking> HE DO IT
[3:21:34] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Yakuza is fun to watch
[3:21:36] <majindusto> Big Yakuzie numbers
[3:21:38] <manoshake> THAT'S CORRECT
[3:21:40] <$RaikenTB> PS4 blocks the game if you try streaming it. needs a capture device.
[3:21:41] <BananaSurgery> old?
[3:21:42] <%aivalera> YA DOIN IT
[3:21:43] <+LowBatteryLife> Wettest and sloppiest.
[3:21:45] <%TheNewJapanGuy> You have to do the entire series now Pat
[3:21:45] <%DirtyGaijin> Why no one want the Yakuza?
[3:21:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yakuza isnt boring Kappa
[3:21:46] <Deano8817> new old
[3:21:46] <%vaporousTippler> @MahoganyWoods Temple of Elemental Evil is the most accurate D&D 3.5 game ever. And it's broken as shit. Barely even runs.
[3:21:47] <%starotter70> Kiwami...sure
[3:21:47] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Will pat play Judgment on stream?
[3:21:48] <%Plague_Nurse> You mean Yakuza, not Kiwami
[3:21:51] <aimlesshealer> Like I have 0 interest in playing Yakuza (though it's a good game I'm sure), but it's fun watching Kiryu punch dudes in the face
[3:21:52] <Bouldus> @DedlokPM yea i skip the NV streams too
[3:22:01] <KeiPrime> 0 blew up but i dont think any of the others will get that hype tho
[3:22:03] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @angriestpat we joke about Battleborn, but name a single character from James Cameron's Avatar
[3:22:06] <natebud> Does this game have any notable additions to the moves list over Yakuza 0?
[3:22:07] <Prevot> CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[3:22:10] <lizard0tm> I want to see Yakuza 5
[3:22:10] <+AhmCha> Did you play The Fist of the North Star one? It's so good
[3:22:10] <%Onlysamfisher > pat is Canada just like trailer park boys says it is? do you guys just grow dope and shot at each other consistently?
[3:22:12] <%mayorrev> FIRE D:

[3:22:14] <+abruptabe> The tracking definitely has to be broken, I've seen Cohncarnage streaming it
[3:22:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> For those keeping track, this is 3.

[3:23:52] <+miguelrod777> I'll skip the entire of the casino dlc
[3:23:56] <$ooblagis> The DLC is the best part of NV
[3:23:56] <$KnivesEve> new veggus is a good nap stream
[3:23:57] <Darren716> Pat why dont you do the DLC first? It makes more sense story wise
[3:24:00] <Smaenus> I do the DLC early so I could fuck around with all the cool stuff in the main story
[3:24:00] <%Plague_Nurse> She's pretty mature for what should be a 9-12 year old
[3:24:00] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> You are a child haruka why are you having these thought???
[3:24:01] <aimlesshealer> There's a Shadowrun crpg right? Is it good? I wonder if I should play it
[3:24:02] <$RaikenTB> But do it though
[3:24:03] <%startadevy> CurseLit

[3:25:10] <%shiplord13> Its France guys
[3:25:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's 3.
[3:25:13] <devanmuse> anyone remember that anime Durarara? That show was all about Japanese Color Gangs
[3:25:13] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Russia uses a slightly lighter blue in their flag
[3:25:14] <Deano8817> @xemnahort Kiwami's fine in that case, but 0 is pretty cheap to get on both ps4 and PC
[3:25:15] <$MightyMaxT> So, @AngriestPat is it true that Yakuza 6 has an online VirtuaFighter 5 just built into it?
[3:25:17] <leargo> He'l just punch everyone
[3:25:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's the 3rd game.
[3:25:19] <%px120> It's in 3
[3:25:20] <%TIME_PUNCHER> red white and blue? so russian?

[3:25:31] <majindusto> 3
[3:25:31] <natebud> It's Norwegians. I knew it.
[3:25:32] <%mr_slaide> Are they gonna do like Fat Albert and save the community center?
[3:25:36] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Wait, wasn't it 4?
[3:25:38] <%alexandrecau> 6 and kiwami 2 have a lot of gang shit going on
[3:25:39] <%startadevy> I'm from a rival gang
[3:25:41] <devanmuse> Gotta go fight THE DOLLARS!!
[3:25:43] <$ooblagis> In Kiwami 2, this gang's main enforcer is the boss of the Majima Construction minigame
[3:25:45] <Darren716> Are those the idiots with the feathers that show up in 4?
[3:25:45] <Huntercd> The power of an ass beating
[3:25:47] <%shiplord13> Kiryu then beats them all to death for changing their ways
[3:25:48] <Ner234> EDGE
[3:25:50] <majindusto> 3 or 4
[3:25:51] <Prevot> E D G E
[3:25:52] <%TheNewJapanGuy> WHITE EDGE
[3:25:53] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Kiryu beat the crime out of them
[3:25:56] <%TIME_PUNCHER> why do flags have such a hard on for red white and blue
[3:25:57] <aimlesshealer> I'm a real tough bloke, I'll murder your wife
[3:25:58] <Darren716> I remember seeing them in the LP and you said they were from 3

[3:26:03] <$ooblagis> Race War?
[3:26:03] <%SaltyDongs> like that person who used kiryu as a father figure
[3:26:04] <thelaxinator> 4 had a quest about a red bandana gang working as vigilantes or something...
[3:26:08] <WaxWitch> France, what they gonna do beat ppl with a baguette?
[3:26:08] <%salty_syd913> why are they fighting? Kiryu's wearing white?
[3:26:14] <%TIME_PUNCHER> why not purple orange and pink flags
[3:26:15] <+VoytekBus> Edge is pretty white
[3:26:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ded
[3:26:17] <dekkitout> Christ
[3:26:17] <+LowBatteryLife> Honest Hearts isn't bad, but it's more fun if you play it very early in your NV game so a bunch of Thunder Drummers with full-on anti-tank rifles don't spawn and wreck your shit for lulz,
[3:26:18] <%TheNewJapanGuy> woolieSMUG Race.... War..?

[3:26:55] <KeiPrime> yeah i love this piece of lore lol
[3:26:57] <+McLellanJ> @AngriestPat DBFZ has no rank degradation so even though I haven't played the game since launch and am ass at the game, I keep getting matched with people who are red squares 400,000 points help
[3:27:00] <%Nobrev> is there ever a situation in these games where sombody starts some shit and when you go to investigate they see you and just go "oh god oh fuck we pissed off kiryu"
[3:27:04] <+HeyBoston> yeeee that one guy loves it
[3:27:07] <leargo> dang
[3:27:12] <%starotter70> Kiryu is a Hazing Machine

[3:27:29] <omen_setter> LUL
[3:27:30] <dekkitout> Krampus?

[3:27:38] <VanaSkiller> LUL
[3:27:38] <thelaxinator> Remember recycling in Yakuza 4? How fun was that?
[3:27:40] <%startadevy> HolidaySanta

[3:27:44] <+Mittensbro> LUL
[3:27:47] <%Typhaeon> Oscar-winning PSP game Black Panther
[3:27:48] <%PeaceCentennial> I think the common street punk gets it harder than anyone else in Yakuza
[3:27:49] <%CerberusDriver> CHOSEN ONE
[3:27:52] <%startadevy> krampus
[3:27:53] <dekkitout> Black Panther, no relation
[3:27:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Black Panther has a lot of "Kiryu the Dragon of Dojima Ultra-God" lore.
[3:28:01] <%PeaceCentennial> because sometimes they don't even get a hit on him
[3:28:02] <DonatelloJose> IM COMING
[3:28:05] <%mayorrev> get the TRESH
[3:28:06] <%startadevy> fuck the police
[3:28:09] <%shiplord13> Its a rite of passage you need to be physical beaten by Kiryu to be brought in to the Yakuza
[3:28:14] <%PeaceCentennial> I like that because in Yakuza 1, he's a big legend already
[3:28:16] <%startadevy> HeyGuys
[3:28:17] <majindusto> Made by the Def Jam fight for NY developer
[3:28:21] <+HeyBoston> get the bin
[3:28:25] <aimlesshealer> Stripey over there is punching the air real good
[3:28:26] <%grimpo96> Every year we send our idiots to get the sh*t beaten out of them by this one dude we know of
[3:28:30] <HefestoForges> all that fart gas
[3:28:36] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Okay, so in the Yakuza, the families are the subdivisions of the clan?
[3:28:36] <%CerberusDriver> by the time Yakuza 6 rolls around, Kiryu is like god deity status
[3:28:39] <%startadevy> cohhSip
[3:28:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PlainSimpleTailor Yes.
[3:28:46] <%TIME_PUNCHER> pat would you rather have an IRL special meter or three health bars?
[3:28:47] <%PeaceCentennial> Has Pat done "Goromi" yet?
[3:28:48] <Deano8817> @PlainSimpleTailor yeah basically
[3:28:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yes @PeaceCentennial
[3:28:59] <%PeaceCentennial> Nice
[3:29:00] <thelaxinator> Goromi has been achieved
[3:29:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And having your own family is a big fucking deal in the yakuza world.
[3:29:05] <AstroFalcon09> pat sponsored by division 2 eh Kappa
[3:29:18] <%badchoice5> All other fights are simply preparation for Majima fights
[3:29:19] <skelton_man> @angriestpat can explain the plot of the yakuza franchise in as little words as possible
[3:29:22] <Aussie_Manny> EEEEEEEEEYAH!
[3:29:34] <切捨御免> D: don't call majima an asshole
[3:29:35] <$ooblagis> "much a lot of experience you would get otherwise"
[3:29:36] <%crowsloft77> probably to make up for the lack of Mr.Shakedown
[3:29:37] <Deano8817> SELLOUT
[3:29:41] <%CerberusDriver> play that Schlooter
[3:29:42] <%ItsKitKat_> It sucks that Mr shakedowns are wayyy harder than majima
[3:29:43] <AstroFalcon09> the grind is on
[3:29:44] <%Plague_Nurse> The beta is tomorrow I think
[3:29:50] <+d00msdaydan> tried division 2 for about 10 minutes, then stopped because it's still set in the boring modern world
[3:29:51] <lizard0tm> The Beta is today
[3:29:52] <$RaikenTB> Why?
[3:29:54] <thelaxinator> It looks fine, I've heard some dirt about the endgame but it's probably fine for a minute
[3:29:56] <kingdudeby> been playing the beta. It's pretty good, some audio bugs but nothing too bad. So far
[3:29:57] <Aussie_Manny> BigPhish
[3:30:01] <omen_setter> i enjoy that you can cheese gaining experience in Kiwami 2 but eating a lot
[3:30:03] <dekkitout> Res Storm and Massive
[3:30:04] <%Agami23> know what sucks? DMC5 and the new fate/extella game come out the same week
[3:30:05] <%vaporousTippler> Been playing D2 most of the night. Feels pretty good.
[3:30:08] <lizard0tm> I'm playing the division 2 beta right now
[3:30:10] <WaxWitch> He has a police uniform, think about that for a second, how?
[3:30:14] <$RaikenTB> 極
[3:30:15] <%startadevy> GivePLZ GivePLZ TakeNRG GivePLZ GivePLZ GivePLZ TakeNRG
[3:30:19] <切捨御免> like a canadian who has never actually been to the US's idea of the US?
[3:30:23] <%TIME_PUNCHER> now Pat, remember on Sunday it's QUITE shy, not QUIET shy
[3:30:27] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat when you and woolie discuss the DMCV Final trailer can you announce when you're done discussing it so people who skipped it aren't spoiled?
[3:30:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @WaxWitch You can buy authentic police uniforms online man.
[3:30:29] <KeiPrime> kiwami 2's leveling is so much faster than 6's
[3:30:29] <%PlainSimpleTailor> And the other gist of the Yakuza is that they were once Samurai, but they got replaced by commoners that they couldn't just murder on a whim anymore, so they became criminals because they were so butthurt about it?
[3:30:39] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @agami23 so you're saying dmc 5 comes out?
[3:30:40] <ancrest_tant> How's Pat's Dragon style coming along?
[3:30:41] <%vaporousTippler> I'm fairly sure Division 2 is set after the Great Disappointment of 1844. Could be wrong.
[3:30:51] <%lloyddboy> EYYYAH
[3:30:52] <%CerberusDriver> wait, DMC5 is a VIDEO GAME?
[3:30:56] <%starotter70> "Face To Fist Style, how'd you like it!?" - Majima
[3:30:56] <majindusto> Easy...Don't buy Fate, Buy DMCV
[3:30:57] <%PeaceCentennial> Honestly the Majima fights in this game just made me miss playing as Majima
[3:30:58] <AstroFalcon09> What majima rank is pat?
[3:31:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PlainSimpleTailor No, it's a lot more complicated than that.
[3:31:01] <%ElenaManetta> what COOL THINGS did i miss
[3:31:04] <%PeaceCentennial> Slugger is such a fun style
[3:31:06] <WaxWitch> in the time frame of this game? @Too_Much_Nukie
[3:31:06] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Oh ok
[3:31:09] <%startadevy> apatHoldon bitch
[3:31:12] <SephirKath> Is this guy a real cop? He seems crazy.
[3:31:13] <%Plague_Nurse> some hacks
[3:31:15] <Gorgen> Montreal?
[3:31:17] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> @elenamanetta nothing because it’s pat
[3:31:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @WaxWitch Yes. This is 2005.
[3:31:20] <T_Sasquatch> oh yea , did pat talk about the dmcv trailer ??
[3:31:23] <Deano8817> ubisoft something or other
[3:31:29] <leargo> 30 times?
[3:31:30] <thelaxinator> I thought it was quietshy because she's mute and quiteshallow as a play off that name
[3:31:31] <%laserbeaming> The Govenrment of Montreal Kappa
[3:31:32] <%mayorrev> can you play as Majima?
[3:31:32] <omen_setter> in order to give the former samurai shit to do the government just gave a lot of them land in hokkaido
[3:31:33] <Deano8817> man I wish I could memorize their dev teams better
[3:31:35] <%ElenaManetta> i wouldn't watch laaaamme streamers
[3:31:35] <%ItsKitKat_> ubi Montreal i believe
[3:31:37] <%starotter70> @T_Sasquatch Yeah in like the beginning of the stream
[3:31:38] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I just remember stories about what utter trash people the Samurai were.
[3:31:44] <dekkitout> It's Massive Entertainment, no
[3:31:47] <AstroFalcon09> they are
[3:31:49] <WaxWitch> oh shit, for some reason i thought it was earlier LUL @Too_Much_Nukie
[3:31:55] <%Nobrev> they definitely are
[3:31:57] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat Colosseum d o g it's the best
[3:31:58] <%CerberusDriver> what does that mean
[3:32:00] <Deano8817> eh we're used to it

[3:32:01] <+UnU__> wiki says Swedish ",assie Entertainment" is developing
[3:32:01] <Them00n> Be American get shot.
[3:32:02] <T_Sasquatch> the divisions aesthetic is ResidentSleeper
[3:32:03] <kingdudeby> Making fun of who?
[3:32:05] <%PeaceCentennial> America
[3:32:06] <%aivalera> That’s fine, we kinda deserve

[3:32:12] <+HeyBoston> yeah sure kid, you're the big hero
[3:32:16] <natebud> I can't take the trailer seriously. The president's voice actor is awful.
[3:32:23] <$Piemono> What big America save day? What joke there?

[3:32:31] <%aivalera> Do you jnow what we did to the natives? Fuvk ‘Merica!
[3:32:31] <+zaworldo> R I C H A R D
[3:32:34] <%Plague_Nurse> People keep supporting Ubisoft. We deserve to suffer
[3:32:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Children's Park, next to Pocket Racing. That's where you need to go.
[3:32:37] <%OwlLightningMage> I saw the trailer and thought it was a joke
[3:32:38] <lizard0tm> They are tho
[3:32:40] <%starotter70> Like Metal Wolf but without the parody aspect?
[3:32:40] <%vaporousTippler> Tom Clancy started serious, but it's transformed over the years. Ever play Wildlands? That shit is nuts.
[3:32:44] <%CerberusDriver> america deserves it tho ;)
[3:32:45] <Carnadan> Clancy definitely believed that the military >>> gov't politicians
[3:32:47] <%Keyd00d> glad I don't follow any of those games
[3:32:48] <+VoytekBus> But its true
[3:32:50] <%Agami23> you wanna see a REAL goverment shutdown?
[3:32:50] <buildtofail> But it's DC my hometown
[3:32:53] <%mayorrev> nooooooo
[3:32:54] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Tom Clancy novels and games haven't required tom clancy long before tom died
[3:32:55] <%LethargicRush> kiryu theres money in the bannana bar!

[3:32:59] <%Mornaka> not th ebananas!
[3:33:00] <%Typhaeon> There is no more money in the banana stand
[3:33:03] <rhus> rip gogo dancer kiryu
[3:33:04] <lizard0tm> "The Division" in Division are essentially the Guardians
[3:33:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Banana slammad
[3:33:05] <%Ion_LaserX> Tom Clancy had a huge boner for the US military
[3:33:06] <Smaenus> Saddest quest in the game FeelsBadMan
[3:33:07] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat Well there was that one time that they did the "We'll show you a REAL government shutdown!" while the government shutdown was happening so I'd believe it.
[3:33:08] <majindusto> BibleThump
[3:33:09] <stabbityrabbit> That honestly sounds on par for America.
[3:33:10] <Deano8817> Tachibana monkaS
[3:33:13] <SailingSaturn> The Division always felt like a stale premise since nothing could get better, judging from the gameplay core
[3:33:14] <%alexandrecau> collar poopin' Kiryu
[3:33:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oh man, tachibana
[3:33:15] <%Fidranth> never forget Tachibana
[3:33:16] <natebud> I see the one big upgrade to the models is that most of them are blonde now.
[3:33:16] <Rincewind1998> It's funny, because a lot of Tom Clancy's work featured morally ambiguous characters, and people dying in really upsetting ways before they can get a big hero moment.
[3:33:16] <arcaderabbit48> Honestly yeah, I can definitely see that. Haven't exactly been paying attention to it cause FPS arent my thing, but the trailers do give that impression
[3:33:18] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Hey, if you make fun of us, the most we'll do is get salty. Other 'groups' on the other hand
[3:33:20] <$RaikenTB> sad music
[3:33:24] <dekkitout> The Division are literally sleeper agents
[3:33:27] <%PeaceCentennial> Hey Pat, isn't it weird that a ton of the sidequests in Yakuza 1 are "oh this guy is trying to scam you, say no and then beat them up"
[3:33:31] <%vaporousTippler> Honestly, Div 2 feels more like a Fallout sort of game than 1 did.
[3:33:34] <randoli_spugoli> typical ubi ego stroking
[3:33:35] <kingdudeby> I wouldn't say it's making fun of anyone. But it's definitely not suppose to be realistic.
[3:33:38] <%king_wragles> I MISSED THE BaNANA BAR!
[3:33:41] <rhus> I LOVED that
[3:33:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat You need to go to the Children's Park, up by the Pocket Racing Stadium.
[3:33:42] <Deano8817> save us
[3:33:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat smell
[3:34:00] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat needs to do the Pocket Racing for one of the best Dragon Style upgrades
[3:34:00] <thelaxinator> perhaps the red light district is filled with crime
[3:34:03] <%Nobrev> sleeper agents that aren't brainwashed and know they're sleepers
[3:34:05] <%CerberusDriver> ill try scamming the DRAGON OF DOJIMA itll go well im sure.
[3:34:06] <Smaenus> I got way too into pocket racing in this game
[3:34:08] <%ItsKitKat_> It sucks that Mr shakedowns are wayyy harder than majima
[3:34:10] <%alexandrecau> on lost paradise half the sidequests are I'm gonna sell a kid to slavery
[3:34:10] <%Plague_Nurse> check your map
[3:34:12] <natebud> Everywhere but nowhere
[3:34:13] <Smaenus> It's more hype than it should be
[3:34:13] <WaxWitch> that's life, everyone scams
[3:34:15] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Monster Hunter International series feels like LOtR written by Tom Clancy
[3:34:25] <%CerberusDriver> BLUE FO LYFE
[3:34:27] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> PURPLE GANG ASSEMBLE
[3:34:29] <Deano8817> is that the water pokemon gang
[3:34:30] <ancrest_tant> If you think about, life's side quest are about avoiding scams
[3:34:34] <%Plague_Nurse> crips
[3:34:34] <thelaxinator> at a certain point after sunset a school girl uniform is suspicious
[3:34:36] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> P U R P L E G A N G
[3:34:39] <kingdudeby> Division 2 feels like a, "you're the guy." style game even though you don't have a name and people rarely talk about you.
[3:34:41] <+HeyBoston> oh this guy is about to get FUCKING OWNED
[3:34:41] <%alexandrecau> Where is the gambling wizard
[3:34:41] <AzirothTheGreat> did he do pocket racing?
[3:34:41] <natebud> They live in a blue house and drive a little blue car
[3:34:45] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> We crippin now y’all
[3:34:45] <%startadevy> humble bundle
[3:34:46] <%CerberusDriver> we just wanted to beat up homeless people!
[3:34:54] <%PeaceCentennial> Blue Z Gangster is a smart man
[3:34:55] <%machshop> it's redneck porn
[3:34:56] <lizard0tm> "WE DIDN'T LOOK FOR KIDS!" They say standing in a childrens playground
[3:34:57] <%PeaceCentennial> lets beat up this yakuza
[3:34:58] <%ScreamingMeat> Tom Clancy is spinning
[3:35:00] <%Luna_Ashford> @AngriestPat A parody of itself?
[3:35:00] <xtremegamer80> It's team Mystic!
[3:35:00] <natebud> And everything is blue. they're blue
[3:35:03] <+HeyBoston> k-beckers
[3:35:11] <$Tuskor13> show it to a gamestop
[3:35:16] <%Mornaka> I enjoyd the first rainbow 6 book
[3:35:24] <UltraBulldozer> Never getting another good Splinter Cell, feels bad man.
[3:35:29] <%TIME_PUNCHER> remember the tom clancy young adult novels? Net Force Explorers?
[3:35:29] <dekkitout> It's so straitlaced and on the nose, it feels like parody
[3:35:30] <natebud> I feel like one guy game came up with a joke and it just went over everyon'e head
[3:35:36] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat It's Abstergo trying to brainwash them kids with the Templar shit.
[3:35:43] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@VanLynx) (warning)
[3:35:44] <%Divryne> apatDab
[3:35:44] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Splinter Cell Blacklist was good
[3:35:49] <kingdudeby> You're right. They need to go crazier.

[3:35:53] <%Mornaka> I'm pretty easy to please with media though

[3:36:14] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Where’s my Ubisoft Cinematic Universe?!
[3:36:17] <%Divryne> Remember Ubisoft owns Abstergo. LUL
[3:36:20] <%lloyddboy> disdick
[3:36:21] <%PeaceCentennial> so one of my biggest issues in this game is the nerf to Dragon style's damage for no reason whatsoever
[3:36:22] <+Ell1ot> is that the vending machine with the porn in it?
[3:36:26] <%shiplord13> Yep they likely French
[3:36:29] <$hatesdps> my mom walked into me asleep to the puppet sex scene from team america, it was some watamote shit
[3:36:31] <stabbityrabbit> I think you don't understand how important things like the troops are here. They're second only to god here.
[3:36:31] <+HotBloodedHero> Now what if we gave the franchise to a Japanese studio?
[3:36:39] <%starotter70> YEAH
[3:36:42] <%lloyddboy> OOF

[3:36:52] <+HeyBoston> the fence suplex is always the best one

[3:36:54] <TheBigO75> yeyeyeyeye
[3:36:56] <%CerberusDriver> Wrestling moves outside of wrestling is the hypest shit
[3:36:58] <CurrySauseBandit> He's not dead. He just has a severed spine. Calm down.
[3:37:00] <%ItsKitKat_> he will never walk again
[3:37:01] <%MegboyManuel> I always thought color gangs was just an anime thing
[3:37:02] <%king_wragles> Kiryu doesn't kill people, HE JUST CRIPPLES THEM FOR LIFE
[3:37:02] <%Plague_Nurse> Suplex the Bloods
[3:37:08] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I genuinely forget about the the modern day bullshit in Assassin's Creed games sometimes.
[3:37:08] <lizard0tm> Ye
[3:37:10] <WaxWitch> i forgot what you're going, why are you fighting color themed gangs?
[3:37:11] <dekkitout> March 15

[3:37:13] <kingdudeby> March 14th
[3:37:15] <+HeyBoston> fuck that BIKE
[3:37:15] <NeroInfinite> ya
[3:37:17] <buildtofail> 22
[3:37:20] <NeroInfinite> march 15
[3:37:23] <%Divryne> Open beta is now.
[3:37:31] <%alexandrecau> Kiryu doesn't kill people, doctors just fail to save their lives
[3:37:35] <natebud> I feel like the joke gets real old real fast when you actually have to play the division.
[3:37:41] <%PeaceCentennial> thug majima
[3:37:44] <lizard0tm> @buildtofail 22 is Sekiro
[3:37:45] <%machshop> toejam & earl came out today and it's pretty good
[3:37:48] <%PeaceCentennial> oh wait
[3:37:49] <%PeaceCentennial> breaker
[3:37:51] <$hatesdps> division is some spunkgaggleweewee isnt it
[3:37:51] <%ScreamingMeat> Majima is such a fucking weirdo
[3:37:54] <%starotter70> Fair enough
[3:37:54] <+HeyBoston> who is really at fault when you buy the division
[3:37:57] <%PeaceCentennial> Breaker is way too strong
[3:37:57] <dekkitout> Warning, the early game is a slough, and building a gear set is a pain in the ass in endgame
[3:38:06] <%PeaceCentennial> it always was
[3:38:08] <%arancet> just tried the div2 open beta, doesn't feel bad to oh man i find it incredibly dull
[3:38:08] <%laserbeaming> Breaker Syle PogChamp
[3:38:16] <WaxWitch> He sure is, but the best weirdo we've ever seen LUL
[3:38:16] <majindusto> Majima GETTING BIGGER
[3:38:19] <%MegboyManuel> Kiryu doesnt kill people, it's just the guard rail hitting them too hard
[3:38:21] <%Fidranth> the best style from 0
[3:38:26] <$RaikenTB> Majima exposing Pat LUL
[3:38:30] <切捨御免> "so this is what it feels like to be on the receiving end of this"
[3:38:32] <Huntercd> Have Paige or Plague on to provide context @AngriestPat
[3:38:32] <%king_wragles> Kiryu doesn't kill people, the tragic symptoms of multiple concussions catch up with them and then they die as a result
[3:38:34] <%CerberusDriver> balls being exposed
[3:38:37] <%ScreamingMeat> What about Dargan style?
[3:38:38] <%shiplord13> Yeah you used it a lot in your playthrough
[3:38:49] <Smaenus> I played Division 1 when it came out, got to end game and it was FULL of hackers, and never played it again
[3:38:49] <$ooblagis> Until you get Tiger Drop. Then breaker is free
[3:38:49] <Deano8817> who would win, tiger drop or knife counter
[3:38:55] <$hatesdps> what about pargon pargon pargon style
[3:38:56] <Rincewind1998> It's OP until you learn you can do MULTIPLE TIGER DROPS while he does a spinning move
[3:38:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Once you get counter moves breaker is a joke because you can pretty much always counter the attacks with their long animations.
[3:39:02] <%ElenaManetta> If Majima just kept spinning forever, you could never beat him.
[3:39:09] <WaxWitch> ^
[3:39:10] <%mayorrev> you can play as majima yeah?
[3:39:11] <%MegboyManuel> Kiryu doesnt kill people, they kill themselves on Kiryu's fists
[3:39:16] <%px120> It genuinely feels like its "Oh, he started a combo, guess I'll just wait"
[3:39:17] <+cafefunk> Pat stream PogChamp
[3:39:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @mayorrev No, that's Kiwami 2.
[3:39:18] <agadejobi> Does Majima use his Mad Dog style against you in this game?
[3:39:20] <Deano8817> @mayorrev in other games yes, not in this one
[3:39:23] <natebud> Do taunts still have bonuses? you should taunt when hes stuck spinning there
[3:39:27] <omen_setter> he is dancing, dancing. he says he will never die.
[3:39:31] <UltraBulldozer> if you dont have tiger Drop, breaker takes so long because of his spin kicks
[3:39:35] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@hatesdps) (warning)
[3:39:37] <%PeaceCentennial> I mean pat could charge majima in beast form when that happens
[3:39:39] <ancrest_tant> @king_wragles Their bodies just quit after Kiryu is done with them
[3:39:44] <dekkitout> Majima, Self-Perpetual Motion, Goro
[3:39:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In this game you play as Date in one of the climax battles but that's it. It's Kiryu for everything else.
[3:39:49] <$hatesdps> you can tigerdrop a tablehopper?
[3:39:51] <CurrySauseBandit> LUL
[3:39:51] <%lloyddboy> HUBRIS
[3:39:53] <$hatesdps> fuck me
[3:39:54] <%Ion_LaserX> LUL
[3:39:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:40:04] <%Ion_LaserX> woolieMIRIN
[3:40:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PeaceCentennial No he couldn't. Beast form still has hitstun.
[3:40:22] <%PeaceCentennial> @Too_Much_Nukie yeah but the triangle charge move has armor I think
[3:40:22] <切捨御免> Dempsey roll the breakdancing!
[3:40:26] <NumbusPlays> this style is so cool to watch
[3:40:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It does but not enough, trust me.
[3:40:32] <Deano8817> wait hold the fuck up
[3:40:34] <%TheHeroAppears> apatMenace
[3:40:35] <+KR_Black> when did Majima absorbed Eddy Gordo ?
[3:40:35] <%PeaceCentennial> Fair enough
[3:40:37] <Deano8817> Date is playable in this?
[3:40:38] <+fragdar> is this a jojo reference?
[3:40:39] <simulationbard> Kiryu doesn't kill people because he is legally classified as a force of nature and you can't arrest a hurricane
[3:40:41] <%MegboyManuel> brawler vs break dansa!
[3:40:43] <%weissguard> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[3:40:45] <%mayorrev> HE'S ON FIRE
[3:40:49] <WaxWitch> for sure
[3:40:52] <%PeaceCentennial> I've only done Slugger and Thug Majima in my playthrough
[3:40:53] <aimlesshealer> @simulationbard I bet an Oblivion guard could
[3:40:53] <$hatesdps> beast style shouldve had more armor, woulda made it not the worst style by far
[3:40:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The best way to deal with breaker is Tiger drop, which pat doesn't have. Other counters work well too but he doesn't have those either.
[3:41:00] <agadejobi> Kiryu the Stampede; He doesn't kill anyone either! Honest!
[3:41:02] <omen_setter> I like Rush style but some of their songs are a little long
[3:41:03] <+HeyBoston> here comes the bop
[3:41:13] <bmlife> !liam
[3:41:14] <WaxWitch> Lots of media references JoJo, I'm sure
[3:41:16] <%Keyd00d> pat just do the move it's not worth actually fighting
[3:41:17] <DraxTD> boot to the head @AngriestPat
[3:41:18] <bearwagon> look at that bullshit
[3:41:20] <%startadevy> apatBlep
[3:41:23] <%PeaceCentennial> Beast style is the best when you are in the tstreet and you need to get rid of that random encounter
[3:41:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Damn it focus where's your Kyle?
[3:41:27] <majindusto> CAN'T STOP THE TOP!
[3:41:32] <Gorgen> look at this dancing jackass
[3:41:32] <$hatesdps> or if you have a bicycle
[3:41:34] <simulationbard> @aimlesshealer STOP, You've violated the law
[3:41:40] <Deano8817> Beast style is fantastic for the weapon damage it does
[3:41:42] <agadejobi> Kyle for Street Fighter V
[3:41:42] <dekkitout> Anything that exists in a post-JoJo world is a JoJo reference
[3:41:49] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Majima is literally just in this game to troll you
[3:41:50] <%king_wragles> I can't think of anymore "kiryu doesn't kill" jokes
[3:41:53] <WaxWitch> LUL
[3:41:55] <+Chronobot> Eat the can
[3:41:56] <Rincewind1998> Beast style gets absurd once you unlock the bear hug move
[3:41:57] <HefestoForges> eat IRL redbulls pat
[3:41:57] <%TheHeroAppears> you would think after watching you for 10 minutes the crowd would get bored
[3:41:58] <%Divryne> Tasty tasty Red Bull.
[3:42:02] <Deano8817> NICE DAMAGE LUL
[3:42:08] <omen_setter> JoJo encompasses all media. It is the ur-text for intertextuality
[3:42:12] <%Keyd00d> ora was a thing before jojo
[3:42:12] <%Typhaeon> Those people have not played the Fist of the North Star spinoff
[3:42:13] <%PeaceCentennial> they're probably kenshiro references
[3:42:15] <%PeaceCentennial> since you know
[3:42:15] <%aivalera> Is that why you’re playing the yakuza srries? For the red bulls?
[3:42:20] <%PeaceCentennial> they made a fotns game
[3:42:22] <%BestTeaMaker> but that would be ATATATATATATA
[3:42:23] <leargo> *clip clip clap* this delincuents are so enterteining
[3:42:24] <%GarbageNirvana> How dope would it be if the Yakuza team made a Jojo game though
[3:42:24] <%mimikyu92> isn't northstar at-ta-ta
[3:42:25] <AstroFalcon09> yeah i would say fist of the north star
[3:42:27] <切捨御免> Kiryu's real strength isn't his fighting, it's his dimension-warping pockets
[3:42:27] <+d00msdaydan> but pat, everything is a jojo reference!
[3:42:30] <%ScreamingMeat> But Kiryu doesn't make people explode
[3:42:32] <%alexandrecau> Wouldn't kiryu go ATATATATATA then?
[3:42:32] <VanLynx> everything is a jojo
[3:42:36] <arcaderabbit48> @dekkitout Well, Jojo did come out in 1987
[3:42:37] <+fragdar> he says ora ora dude
[3:42:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> People who say Ora Ora's are JoJo references have never seen FotNS. Because the Ora Ora IS a FotNS reference.
[3:42:39] <Zombrocom> Then he should go Atatatatata yeh?
[3:42:39] <+fragdar> common
[3:42:41] <natebud> You talking about that live action movie, Fist of the North Star?
[3:42:43] <majindusto> No?
[3:42:43] <agadejobi> Oh! That reminds me! Some MUDAMUDAMUDA triva!
[3:42:43] <WaxWitch> Jojo means Life
[3:42:44] <%king_wragles> Ya havin a giggle ay mate? @AngriestPat
[3:42:47] <%mayorrev> cmon bruh
[3:42:52] <%machshop> order me to punch!
[3:42:53] <Deano8817> did anyone do the ora battlecry before jotaro?
[3:42:53] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat How do you feel about the new Samurai Showdown? I think it looks neat, like a SFV with gore.
[3:42:53] <Mrthepastyrider> Maybe it's because Kiryu is kinda like Jotaro
[3:42:55] <SailingSaturn> is Pat a jojo reference? cirThink
[3:42:57] <%PeaceCentennial> is your dragon style good yet
[3:43:00] <%shiplord13> It could theoretically go either or
[3:43:01] <simulationbard> Did Fist of the North Star invent the punch rush or did it just make it popular?
[3:43:01] <%mimikyu92> kenshiro never says ora, iirc
[3:43:04] <dekkitout> Didn't FoNS had a guy who Ora's
[3:43:05] <+fragdar> pat is dio
[3:43:06] <$hatesdps> 80 years ago yesteday karsu was defeated
[3:43:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @simulationbard Invented it.
[3:43:13] <Gorgen> wait this isnt a JoJo game?
[3:43:15] <Marpolo13> that feel when people forget ATATAATTATATA because everyone just assumes just ora ora :(
[3:43:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> At least the particular way everybody does it.
[3:43:22] <%PeaceCentennial> that's such a bummer
[3:43:23] <tmix1600> Pat, the kids dont know about the North Star anymore, only the Jojos
[3:43:26] <%PeaceCentennial> I love Dragon Style
[3:43:27] <%starotter70> Well Jojo is a Fist of the North Star reference
[3:43:27] <simulationbard> Cool
[3:43:28] <%mastertwin2> Kiryu is just Jotaro but if he didn't have a stand
[3:43:30] <agadejobi> DIO is not the first character in anime to say "MUDAMUDAMUDA"
[3:43:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dragon Style is good as soon as you get Dragon Speed 2 and the counter moves.
[3:43:32] <majindusto> The "LIVE ACTION FIST OF THE NORTH STAR" lol
[3:43:36] <%OwlLightningMage> You gotta do Pocket Racing or Dragon Style Pat LUL
[3:43:37] <Deano8817> Dragon style is bad until it suddenly becomes amazing, there's no inbetween
[3:43:38] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat Keep fighting Majima and you'll get a metric ass ton
[3:43:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat is slacking but he could easily be using Dragon Style right now.
[3:43:43] <$hatesdps> diger trop is at its most stupid in this game
[3:43:45] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@zaworldo)
[3:43:45] <WaxWitch> why not both?
[3:43:53] <Djinnazz> EDGE
[3:43:53] <AstroFalcon09> So what's the deal with smash players forced to clean themselves up now that there's less smash in evo Kappa
[3:43:54] <ancrest_tant> Dragon style gets good when you complete komaki
[3:44:00] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Zero is so great
[3:44:01] <%PeaceCentennial> Once I finished that side quest I basically never used anything else
[3:44:02] <+fragdar> a game like yakuza, but with any jojo would be awesome
[3:44:02] <%mayorrev> listen to that man fuckin crying
[3:44:04] <%startadevy> coincidence?
[3:44:05] <%mayorrev> on the floor
[3:44:07] <agadejobi> It's actually a character from Metal Armor Dragonar; Lee Sue Min
[3:44:09] <$hatesdps> those komaki missions are fucking rough though
[3:44:10] <Clyderso> EDGE
[3:44:11] <$ooblagis> That's not true, as soon as you start unlocking scroll moves it's becomes viable
[3:44:13] <%salty_syd913> oh
[3:44:15] <lizard0tm> Fucking dead
[3:44:16] <omen_setter> he's ok
[3:44:16] <Deano8817> that's a bush he's fine
[3:44:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[3:44:18] <natebud> go microwave one
[3:44:19] <TheBigO75> jesus
[3:44:19] <Ner234> NO He's dead I'm sure
[3:44:19] <stabbityrabbit> Holy shit Kiryu.
[3:44:20] <+Andrizzleton> definitely ALIVE
[3:44:21] <+HeyBoston> actual murder in the city street.
[3:44:22] <Ayy_Nick14> he's just taking a good ole sidewalk nap
[3:44:26] <%startadevy> apatBig
[3:44:27] <%weissguard> Lvl 99 Dragon/Mad Dog Style in 0 is bonkers, iirc.
[3:44:29] <omen_setter> he's really sorry guys
[3:44:30] <%starotter70> Should I watch the FotNS Live Action Moive? It looks so embarrising that I kind feel compelled
[3:44:31] <%lloyddboy> did you see RedLetterMedia has FOTNS on tape?
[3:44:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't even need to finish Komaki's training. Just get dragon speed 2 and the four gods heat move. Even without the better counters it's good to go from there.
[3:44:41] <$hatesdps> dueling komaki in the champion district was hot bullshit
[3:44:45] <AstroFalcon09> Edge
[3:44:49] <%king_wragles> He's not dead, the cells in his body simply stopped doing anything.
[3:44:50] <KeiPrime> the live action is so bad lol
[3:44:51] <lizard0tm> Now fight the same dudes 10 ft away
[3:44:52] <person181> @fragdar ya lets see how johnny handles these fights
[3:44:52] <$nademonkey1100> HES FUCKING DEAD PAT
[3:44:53] <kite1haseo> call an ambulance
[3:44:55] <%mimikyu92> 'alive' and 'fine' aren't the same, pat. he doesn't kill them. thay re not fine.
[3:44:57] <leargo> just a little bruised
[3:45:06] <majindusto> Hes just in a Coma, he'll be Ok!
[3:45:07] <dekkitout> Not dead- just... a healing coma
[3:45:14] <Deano8817> Man, I can't believe this guy had a heart attack at the exact moment kiryu punched his heart, what bad timing
[3:45:14] <omen_setter> he taught them a lesson. they're good boys now
[3:45:17] <WaxWitch> they will shake it off, it's fine
[3:45:19] <AstroFalcon09> Not Dead just a permanant sleep
[3:45:20] <%ItsKitKat_> its canon that there is a team of peramedics following kiyru around
[3:45:22] <+HeyBoston> street punks don't odin sleep
[3:45:35] <agadejobi> So what exactly do these gang members expect to happen after they pick on a Yakuza?
[3:45:43] <%Plague_Nurse> apatCrazy
[3:45:52] <KeiPrime> thug
[3:45:52] <%king_wragles> @HeyBoston do they after fighting Kyru
[3:45:54] <切捨御免> wrong again bucko
[3:45:54] <Zombrocom> Thug
[3:45:55] <aimlesshealer> Damn I just realized how sweet Majima's shoes are
[3:45:56] <%Tearonex> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[3:45:57] <%Gameington_IV> apatCrazy apatCrazy
[3:45:58] <leargo> they expect succes and fame
[3:46:01] <%lloyddboy> bug style
[3:46:03] <%weissguard> Thug style indeed.
[3:46:05] <%startadevy> apatBlep
[3:46:06] <majindusto> Thugger Style
[3:46:10] <KeiPrime> mesuking style
[3:46:10] <TheBigO75> Craaaazy talku
[3:46:11] <+fragdar> @person181 i didnt like part 7 exept for gyro and valentine.. fight me
[3:46:14] <%mastertwin2> THUGGERY, live in Kamurocho!
[3:46:15] <Deano8817> majima's shoes are primed for break dancing and dick kicking
[3:46:33] <CryptusMaximus> Dragon is INCREDIBLY useful once you get all the parries, counters, and double dashing abilities. Instantly goes from dead last to best in the game.
[3:46:41] <+VoytekBus> when does hampster style come in?
[3:46:46] <lizard0tm> Look at these men, exuding big dick energy
[3:46:53] <aimlesshealer> @Deano8817 Also break kicking and dick dancing
[3:46:58] <person181> @fragdar i was more making a joke about how johnny couldn't have a game like this around him
[3:47:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat I hate to be one of those people but you're doing Majima Everywhere wrong. If you look at the requirements for the abilities you need to fight him in specific ways to get abilities.
[3:47:16] <%TheHeroAppears> I left while pat was fighting majima, and he is now in fact fighting a different majima
[3:47:17] <%ItsKitKat_> @AngriestPat is majimas suit dry clean only?
[3:47:20] <%WheatlyXT> Kiwami means EXTREME
[3:47:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dragon style should do already be powerful at this point in the game.
[3:47:28] <+fragdar> @person181 oooh for sure.. and that is one of the reasons that i dont like him
[3:47:31] <+HeyBoston> kiryu beating up majima saying GIVE UPGRADES
[3:47:33] <$hatesdps> hes right
[3:47:35] <%ElenaManetta> have you been fighting majima for like half the stream time now
[3:47:47] <%ElenaManetta> this is like the battle of seven days and seven nights
[3:47:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Like you have to fight specific forms of Majima at certain points.
[3:47:58] <%aivalera> Yep, gotta fight certain vetsions of majima
[3:48:00] <$hatesdps> doing specific subquests, and specific triggers will unlock things
[3:48:03] <$ooblagis> He means specific encounters. i.e. do two Zombie Majima fightsd
[3:48:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Or specific minigame battles.
[3:48:06] <$iwishthiswasicq> When Majima isn't on screen, everyone should be asking "Where's Majima?"
[3:48:09] <%OwlLightningMage> Pocket Racing Pat
[3:48:14] <%kiiiirsten> Just Do It
[3:48:18] <%WheatlyXT> Pocket Racing!
[3:48:33] <%TheHeroAppears> he needs to have a bat
[3:48:34] <$ooblagis> Police doesn't count
[3:48:34] <%shiplord13> I guess not
[3:48:35] <Josef_Stryker> If only you could sing Karaoke with Majima
[3:48:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You are but you're fighting other versions of Majima.
[3:48:35] <+HeyBoston> you fought him at the batting cage with slugger style
[3:48:37] <Deano8817> when majjima's just casually walking around town with a bat specifically
[3:48:42] <arcaderabbit48> @iwishthiswasicq This is literally the basis of the Majima Everywhere System, yes
[3:48:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Check the e-mail LUL
[3:48:46] <$ooblagis> Town means walking around
[3:48:47] <+theAncopro> all the nd ones are gonna be side quests
[3:48:52] <%Ilpala271> da email. da email. oh-oh da email
[3:48:52] <%kiiiirsten> Needs to be slugger
[3:48:55] <person181> needs to be a street fight
[3:49:14] <lizard0tm> Zombie Majima?
[3:49:23] <%mayorrev> is that elmo?
[3:49:23] <%maskedriderhero> You have to do all of Pocket Circuit Racing to unlock Dragon Speed Reborn
[3:49:23] <%king_wragles> you've... you've done most of this? Why isn't it unlocked?
[3:49:31] <+RushUnplugged> yes indeed, zombie majima. it's a thing
[3:49:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's not doing the emails.
[3:49:37] <leargo> nice
[3:49:38] <$ooblagis> Komaki thing is worth it. Do the ring knockout tournament for points
[3:49:40] <Foxbane44> rainstorm him
[3:49:40] <%TheHeroAppears> dude I love zombie majima
[3:49:43] <arcaderabbit48> Zombie Majima sounds hot
[3:49:43] <%WheatlyXT> yeah but do it BETTER
[3:49:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's not doing any of the emails.
[3:49:46] <lizard0tm> Like... an actual zombie?
[3:49:48] <alcors_wisdom> getting majima zombie to spawn again is a bitch and a half
[3:49:49] <TheBigO75> but email
[3:49:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> have you checked your email?
[3:49:50] <natebud> How far into the game are you?
[3:49:50] <VanLynx> except the email
[3:49:55] <Deano8817> it's probably because pat fucking hates pocket circuit
[3:49:55] <majindusto> Dead Souls Reference FTW
[3:49:56] <KeiPrime> he did the email to figh tslugger at the cages
[3:49:56] <aimlesshealer> @Ilpala271 when email comes to town, you know you know it's like a rainstorm. In your browser
[3:49:58] <%mayorrev> emails?
[3:49:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @alcors_wisdom Just walk in and out of a door though.
[3:50:00] <$hatesdps> look at that smug grin, wait til he has to trigger specific forms of majima and has to deal with that
[3:50:02] <%startadevy> bo bi di pa
[3:50:04] <%OwlLightningMage> You have to do the Pocket Racing mini game, bowling, and porn cards at some point
[3:50:05] <%DedlokPM> But his e-mails tho
[3:50:07] <%startadevy> cohhGShow
[3:50:07] <%Aitch971> white edge cmonBruh
[3:50:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's not how you trigger the e-mails Pat.
[3:50:19] <+gabagool420> The emails happen when the emails happen
[3:50:21] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat can we get a Patu-chan emote for this game? =P
[3:50:21] <$ooblagis> You're missing two
[3:50:21] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you are doing it well but the last few are specific
[3:50:23] <Fujiwara_92> What about THE LOCKER PAT?
[3:50:28] <$ooblagis> You didn't do them
[3:50:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to do mini-games. Like Pocket Racing and MesuKing and shit like that.
[3:50:33] <ZatsuHimura> No some emails don't do that
[3:50:34] <simulationbard> Yeah but do the emials to
[3:50:35] <$ooblagis> No Pat
[3:50:36] <artoflec> i couldn't get some of the email mission things to trigger artofl1Hmm
[3:50:39] <bearwagon> no those are when Nishida calls you
[3:50:40] <ZatsuHimura> They just give you skills
[3:50:40] <$hatesdps> I think @Edgy_Macaroon is right
[3:50:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> keep checking
[3:50:43] <$iwishthiswasicq> Oh man, I fucking forgot about Mesuking.
[3:50:45] <person181> have you tried to stuff majima in a locker like a nerd
[3:50:46] <KeiPrime> yeah you gotta do pocket racer and mesuking
[3:50:47] <King___Crimson> The porn store has a really funny one
[3:50:48] <lizard0tm> The White [REDACTED] gang
[3:50:50] <%OwlLightningMage> 3
[3:50:52] <%Cthulos> Chat's gotta talk shit
[3:50:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> apatCrazyhead
[3:50:55] <%Plague_Nurse> 3
[3:50:56] <$ooblagis> No, you have the emails, you just didn't do them
[3:50:56] <%Metballs> Emails are tied to minigames
[3:50:56] <aimlesshealer> 3
[3:50:59] <Deano8817> i think this really just comes down to pat refusing to do pocket circuit LUL
[3:51:00] <$RaikenTB> Pat FailFish
[3:51:01] <%Cthulos> they get lifw
[3:51:06] <%aivalera> Emails happen when you level up your majima
[3:51:07] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[3:51:07] <alcors_wisdom> yeah but you have to maso king to get him to spawn in the sega center
[3:51:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's Officer Majima, not Slugger Majima you fool.
[3:51:15] <NumbusPlays> OUT-A
[3:51:17] <$ooblagis> The CALLS are what advance you
[3:51:18] <%badchoice5> What a nerd, repeating his gags
[3:51:18] <%kiiiirsten> Officer Daddy
[3:51:19] <bearwagon> you cant escape pocket circuit forever
[3:51:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> O U T A
[3:51:27] <VanaSkiller> death note guy?
[3:51:28] <TheBigO75> Crazy Talk Act 3. We are the ones that are wrong.
[3:51:31] <%Piemen99> Damn that's a lot of health
[3:51:33] <majindusto> Officer Slugger
[3:51:35] <lizard0tm> 3
[3:51:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The CALLS are the rank up missions. You haven't been triggering the e-mails at all.
[3:51:36] <%king_wragles> Ya, that's clearly a police baton!
[3:51:38] <%ElenaManetta> does majima have any friends
[3:51:45] <$iwishthiswasicq> Just play Mesuking you coward.
[3:51:47] <artoflec> Yes Kiryu is his friend
[3:51:47] <%Plague_Nurse> apatBig 3
[3:51:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Well, he has Taiga.
[3:51:50] <Mrthepastyrider> After we finish this game are we gonna read Kiryu x Majima fanfiction?
[3:51:50] <T_Sasquatch> tfw king crimson get explained clearly and perfectly in the newest episode Kreygasm
[3:51:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> B I K E
[3:51:54] <omen_setter> majima is not a real baseball player. this is stolen valor
[3:51:54] <%Cthulos> Offislugger
[3:51:55] <%kiiiirsten> Kiryu is his best friend
[3:51:57] <aimlesshealer> When Pat reaches level 60 he can use Crazy Talk to make everyone else in the world wrong
[3:51:57] <$hatesdps> has he triggered the suprise majimas yet?
[3:51:58] <KeiPrime> kiryu is his friend
[3:51:59] <majindusto> Nishida i guess
[3:52:00] <%ItsKitKat_> night everyone
[3:52:00] <%OwlLightningMage> You actually can't escape Pocket Racing Pat. It gives you the movement speed upgrade LUL
[3:52:00] <WaxWitch> His STAND is too strong!
[3:52:04] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Ikuze?
[3:52:04] <person181> he had kiryu
[3:52:07] <%ElenaManetta> good NIGHT kit KAT
[3:52:07] <natebud> His best friend is Kiryu by default
[3:52:08] <%Aitch971> kiryu is his friend
[3:52:09] <person181> *has
[3:52:10] <Josef_Stryker> I just love how Officer Majima actually doesn't fight if Kiryu doesn't have any weapons
[3:52:10] <leargo> wellp
[3:52:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @hatesdps He got Majima from the side at least.
[3:52:13] <Dest_121> kiryu is his friend
[3:52:13] <+Ell1ot> that blind lady likes Majima
[3:52:14] <%aivalera> @angriestpat You have to pocket racer to fully level dragon style iirc
[3:52:14] <KeiPrime> STeel Sharpens Steel
[3:52:14] <%king_wragles> isn't his best friend.... dead? @AngriestPat
[3:52:15] <Tucker0603> kiryu is his friend
[3:52:17] <+Ell1ot> kinda
[3:52:18] <dekkitout> I'm sure Majima keeps private life and Kiryu-antagonizing-life separate
[3:52:19] <%badchoice5> Doesn't his best friend think he betrayed him?
[3:52:20] <%bread_assassin> Kiryu is probably is friend.
[3:52:21] <%startadevy> cohhK
[3:52:23] <Deano8817> LUL
[3:52:24] <%starotter70> You HAVE to
[3:52:26] <KeiPrime> saejima is very much alive
[3:52:26] <Deano8817> I KNEW IT
[3:52:27] <%DedlokPM> I hope that bike owner bought Kiryu insurance!
[3:52:27] <silvcrest> 1
[3:52:27] <Rincewind1998> Weak
[3:52:29] <%Metballs> Then you'll never get Majima
[3:52:29] <majindusto> YOU HAVE TO
[3:52:29] <%TheNewJapanGuy> DO IT
[3:52:29] <alcors_wisdom> oh yeah pat did you see they actually explianed how king crimson works in the anime?
[3:52:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you don't do pocket racing you'll never get Dragon Speed 2.
[3:52:30] <%kiiiirsten> 1
[3:52:30] <artoflec> would you be Majima's friend in real life
[3:52:30] <%Nobrev> then you won't get the email. period
[3:52:31] <%maskedriderhero> if you don't you don't get attack speed
[3:52:33] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat You have to to fight amon
[3:52:33] <%MisterRockett> DO POCKET CIRCUIT
[3:52:33] <$RaikenTB> Coward
[3:52:33] <%Mr_Strut> Do it, coward!
[3:52:34] <+chaumiester> You could... cheat at Pocket Racing off stream. I know I did
[3:52:37] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you have to to max dragon
[3:52:37] <$iwishthiswasicq> I guess you're just not getting those upgrades then. @AngriestPat
[3:52:37] <%MisterRockett> It's canon!
[3:52:38] <%kiiiirsten> Do it you Big Fucko
[3:52:40] <%starotter70> Pathetic
[3:52:40] <%startadevy> TwitchRPG
[3:52:44] <+AppleBasket> Kiryu isn’t in jail, Pat
[3:52:44] <%OwlLightningMage> Attack Speed 3 Pat LUL
[3:52:45] <+Raidou24> You have to for the upgrade
[3:52:47] <Deano8817> @AngriestPat do a big google cheat for pocket circuit
[3:52:48] <Dhurkst> pocket circuit is fun!
[3:52:49] <DraxTD> The CP compells you to DO it @AngriestPat
[3:52:49] <Ner234> BIG COWARD
[3:52:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you don't do MesuKing you'll also never get 2 Dragon Style abilities but I forget which ones.
[3:52:51] <%startadevy> unreal
[3:52:52] <natebud> Pocket Racing is OFFSCREEN only. It is not worth it.
[3:52:52] <%weissguard> Good. F Pocket Circuit.
[3:52:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is that the first time you hit with the high knee??
[3:52:54] <majindusto> THEN NO MAJIMA FOR YOU
[3:52:55] <Josef_Stryker> DO IT COWARD
[3:52:56] <%Metballs> Majima is tied to Pocket Circuit
[3:52:56] <silvcrest> Bad takes, and bad taste. Come to Pat
[3:52:58] <$iwishthiswasicq> Amazing.
[3:52:59] <artoflec> i loved pocket circuit but I can understand not liking it
[3:53:01] <%maskedriderhero> You have to do Pocket Racing and MushiKing to max out Dragon
[3:53:01] <%aivalera> @angriestpat Just use a guide to pocket race, that’s what I did.
[3:53:03] <+Someitalian123> so no amon either?
[3:53:05] <%Cthulos> get paige or fuggins to do it for you
[3:53:07] <stabbityrabbit> Nah, Crazy Talk is just setting us up to start believing Pat. Then it's just going to let him be BIG wrong.
[3:53:07] <$hatesdps> the fact that pocket circuit has rng is baffling
[3:53:09] <%Metballs> Just check a build guide
[3:53:13] <+blackace186> Does anyone know if Pat has the combo grapple for brawler yet?
[3:53:14] <%aivalera> Literally copy paste loadouts
[3:53:15] <TheBigO75> we have reached a new level of coward
[3:53:17] <$RaikenTB> Cue hours later when Pat wishes he had those upgrades.
[3:53:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fake fan
[3:53:24] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Pat you can cheat at pocket racers by just using the correct combinations
[3:53:25] <%Keyd00d> GUH
[3:53:26] <%kiiiirsten> Majima never relaxes
[3:53:29] <%OwlLightningMage> I don't get why Pat refuses to do Pocket Racing considering that its automatic LUL
[3:53:29] <King___Crimson> There's a good one if you check out hte magazines at a convenience store
[3:53:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @hatesdps It doesn't have RNG though, just make a good build and you're fine.
[3:53:31] <artoflec> BIG exps
[3:53:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYE
[3:53:34] <%Piemen99> godamn
[3:53:36] <KeiPrime> yeah do big cheats for pocket racer no one cares
[3:53:36] <majindusto> Pocket Circuit is Fucking Easy
[3:53:41] <devanmuse> didn't you get bonus pocket racing items that are so good they TRIVIALIZE the minigame?
[3:53:43] <%king_wragles> Majima relaxes by getting stressed out
[3:53:46] <ShichiNoBushi> I just saw it tick up to 250+ levels.
[3:53:52] <%Metballs> That was cop majima
[3:53:52] <Deano8817> naaaw that's police majima
[3:53:52] <%Niney_Who> Can't be Officer Majima
[3:53:53] <person181> *oficer majima
[3:53:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That was OFFICER MAJIMA not SLUGGER MAJIMA.
[3:53:56] <%grimpo96> Mashima is by far my favorite character in the game.
[3:53:57] <%bread_assassin> Officer MAjima doesn't count.
[3:53:57] <artoflec> that's "officer" majima not Slugger Majima lol
[3:53:57] <NumbusPlays> I guess you didn't.
[3:53:58] <Huntercd> Has Majima lost his mind?
[3:53:58] <%Niney_Who> Has to be Normal Majima
[3:53:59] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Hey Pat has Woolie played these games?
[3:54:00] <%Metballs> Not slugger
[3:54:04] <Ner234> Officer Majima doesn't count
[3:54:05] <$ooblagis> You can You beat POLICE Majima, not Slugger
[3:54:07] <+jeapes13> you can finish pocket racing suoer fast if you use a guide
[3:54:14] <leargo> what is sluger majima?!
[3:54:17] <CryptusMaximus> I'm currently playing Fist of the North star in Japanese and by far the oddest thing about it is that it feels like Kiryu decided brutal murder was finally ok.
[3:54:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> We're never gonna see Pat use true Dragon Style.
[3:54:23] <$hatesdps> @Too_Much_Nukie BUT the same loadouts can have different results, i had to reload the last mission 3 times because of sds with the right loadout
[3:54:24] <%OwlLightningMage> The pocket racing guide is so good

[4:00:40] <alcors_wisdom> bold of you to assume i wont
[4:00:43] <%QaizerArt> @majindusto dude fuck no it isn't in later races, it's just straight up RNG if your car falls off the track sometimes.
[4:00:44] <%aivalera> @cityscape17 Sry to hear tha
[4:00:44] <%Plague_Nurse> 1
[4:00:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> there was one

[4:01:37] <%Rachet122> o/ everyone, how much have i missed?
[4:01:43] <NumbusPlays> Kiryu JUST SAID he'd kill that guy
[4:01:55] <alcors_wisdom> i bet the guy who owns these batting cages is real sick of kiryu's shit
[4:01:58] <%starotter70> Oh course Pat would get that Amulate
[4:02:00] <%QaizerArt> @aivalera Oh yeah it is easier with a guide on what parts are good to use for which race, but there is still RNG wrt if you start to fall off the track.
[4:02:04] <Ner234> Why does Pat always mash through dialogue?
[4:02:04] <%lloyddboy> PERONGETN amulet
[4:02:08] <natebud> How this game for out of context screenshot material? @AngriestPat
[4:02:19] <%QaizerArt> @natebud fucking amazing
[4:02:33] <natebud> better than zero though!?
[4:02:33] <%aivalera> @cityscape17 Aw, at least you’re a good family member!!
[4:02:44] <Rincewind1998> @natebud peerless
[4:02:44] <%DK_Rance> @Ner234 he reads fast no joke
[4:02:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Rachet122 Okay so, Haruka got kidnapped because date sucks, Kiryu gets her back, pat takes her to a porn shop and then to go and gamble, gets into a fight there, hides haruka with the noble homeless, then haruka leaves because date sucks
[4:02:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat reads super fast.
[4:02:51] <+HeyBoston> that's bait don't take it
[4:02:52] <TheBigO75> pat reads at the speed of light
[4:02:52] <a_mad_dragon> read faster, scrubs
[4:02:53] <+Cityscape17> I try to be @aivalera
[4:02:56] <WaxWitch> he reads like a crackhead runs
[4:02:56] <Ner234> @DK_Rance Huh. Cool
[4:02:57] <%philoboy123> DOUBT
[4:03:01] <$ooblagis> He reads a few words and forms a basic idea
[4:03:02] <%OwlLightningMage> Crazy Talks makes Pat thinks he reads it
[4:03:04] <%TempestaDePrimo> He superimposes his own dialogue as he reads
[4:03:04] <%Nobrev> bullshit
[4:03:08] <$cureneckbeard> pat read fast
[4:03:10] <circular7> he isn't reading it, he just doesn't care
[4:03:11] <%Keyd00d> but do you understand it
[4:03:15] <Dhurkst> @ThatGuyfromMars He's doing his best!
[4:03:18] <+AppleBasket> Just read faster nerds
[4:03:19] <%ssjklyco> If you wish to read the missing dialog, Yakuza Kiwami is $20
[4:03:24] <aimlesshealer> the words touched his eyeballs, that's reading
[4:03:25] <%ssjklyco> Buy it now
[4:03:26] <%aivalera> @qaizerart I never knew there was rng. I just switched between guides when one didn’t work
[4:03:26] <%Plague_Nurse> Pat Lore: he reads fast, no lie
[4:03:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat speed reads but he is genuinely reading it. Just not every single word.
[4:03:30] <circular7> x for doubt
[4:03:32] <%Metballs> Remember that time he said it and Woolie asked him to repeat it and he got it SUPER wrong?
[4:03:33] <faegbeard> imaging seeing someone do an OTG irl
[4:03:34] <%Metballs> Good times
[4:03:39] <Tucker0603> Beast style is my fucking favorite
[4:03:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Dhurkst he sure is, he just can't keep this little girl from being kidnapped tho
[4:03:47] <Frostydough> no @AngriestPat you dont understand, FUCKING VERGIL is confirmed everyone is here
[4:03:49] <%Rachet122> @ThatGuyfromMars thanks
[4:03:53] <+Galactor123> You all really don't know how to speed read? It's a good skill to have.
[4:03:54] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Hey Pat, buy a Jill sandwich right now
[4:03:55] <majindusto> Oh , this upcoming fight in Debolah is a bitch
[4:03:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Rachet122 <3
[4:04:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it is.
[4:04:06] <%ElenaManetta> That NPC is right: Where ARE the hotties?
[4:04:07] <natebud> Debolah sounds like a disease
[4:04:09] <ZatsuHimura> I hate this fight
[4:04:10] <%TempestaDePrimo> Vergil confrimed for what?
[4:04:13] <%ElenaManetta> This game is missing waifus
[4:04:14] <%riantDeliration> this fight is the worst
[4:04:18] <%OwlLightningMage> Time for o and s
[4:04:19] <%QaizerArt> @aivalera Yeah, I watched a fellow play nothing but Pocket Circuit racing for like 6-7 hours and there were times when he had great stats for the course but the car would sometimes just randomly start to go nuts like 3 nights in a race.
[4:04:21] <%ElenaManetta> All it has is handsome men
[4:04:21] <Valdorick> But when are you going into Popeala?
[4:04:24] <%mr_slaide> Dumb asshole.
[4:04:25] <%ssjklyco> I can be your Angle or I can be your Debolah
[4:04:26] <%Plague_Nurse> 3
[4:04:30] <%Agami23> the trailer had a spoiler warning

[4:06:25] <Ner234> Are Pat and Woolie playing DMC 5 together?
[4:06:26] <%Nobrev> tastes like mustard
[4:06:28] <%iwishthiswasicq> I've never even actually used ICQ once.
[4:06:28] <%QaizerArt> Don't drink Skub, kids, it'll kill you. It's the devil.
[4:06:28] <+AppleBasket> Pat did you catch the Japanese Cold??
[4:06:28] <%starotter70> Did she get mustard in it?
[4:06:31] <%Skeletorexplains> Mustard Zero
[4:06:33] <%TempestaDePrimo> coke zero is poison
[4:06:33] <aimlesshealer> Did she put coconut water in that
[4:06:33] <Run44forrest> the shirt covers his waist so he looks like he has tiny pat legs
[4:06:34] <%OwlLightningMage> Coke is bad for you no matter what the form

[4:06:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> coke with mustard
[4:06:45] <%Typhaeon> Although to lesser degree
[4:06:46] <Deano8817> well done
[4:06:46] <%ScreamingMeat> @vaporousTippler I've read that a lot of people actually suffer multiple minor heart attacks and never find out unless a doctor looks at your heart and finds scars
[4:06:47] <%starotter70> Ah, yeah
[4:06:47] <%shiplord13> Done that before
[4:06:47] <TheBlankAce> You'll catch the anime disease from Paige if you share drinks

[4:07:04] <%DedlokPM> yeah pat and woolie are doing a traditional LP on Woolie's channel. Woolie on Nero and V and Pat on Dante

[4:07:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> anime mom disease confirmed

[4:07:32] <+faithless_zealot> @AngriestPat Yeah but ... you're still a fat, unhealthy sloth! And I legitimately worry about you!
[4:07:36] <Polengoldur> Pat's mitochondria are trying to rebel
[4:07:40] <%alexandrecau> @IronPickle Pat is just unable period
[4:07:41] <$cureneckbeard> *Translator's note: Akai is Japanese for red
[4:07:48] <%startadevy> awwwww yes
[4:07:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Guys, we found something wrong with Pat's body!
[4:07:49] <%Mornaka> Remember that time Pat almost died just now?

[4:07:52] <WaxWitch> english is hard man, it happens LUL
[4:07:55] <+AppleBasket> I’m straight but Dante makes me feel things

[4:07:59] <%startadevy> in da club
[4:08:00] <%ScreamingMeat> @rumtumtugnutz It turned out the Elric brothers' mom just choked on her own spit
[4:08:01] <Clyderso> SourPls
[4:08:04] <Good_Snacks> I finished this game a week ago and I hated these two
[4:08:05] <Dhurkst> I remember this fight being a total bitch

[4:08:06] <%startadevy> apatLiz apatBig
[4:08:07] <%Plague_Nurse> Here it is, the most annoying fight in the game
[4:08:10] <%starotter70> YUP
[4:08:12] <CryptusMaximus> Pat betrayed himself, beat your own ass to teach yourself a lesson
[4:08:13] <%TempestaDePrimo> HOW
[4:08:13] <omen_setter> fuck this fight in particular
[4:08:16] <majindusto> THESE GUYS ARE ASS
[4:08:17] <artoflec> these guys are fuckers
[4:08:19] <Ayy_Nick14> EVERYONE hates this fight
[4:08:20] <+theAncopro> If swallow in game you swallow for real
[4:08:20] <%OwlLightningMage> This is the worst fight in the game LUL
[4:08:21] <Polengoldur> @AngriestPat just bring a weapon
[4:08:23] <OverlordGopher> One of the worst in the game
[4:08:24] <%mimikyu92> YOH, YEAH, YOH
[4:08:24] <%Mornaka> damn
[4:08:25] <ZatsuHimura> The most awful fight in the game for me
[4:08:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> as long as you don't die in the night from a cerebral hemorrhage caused by taking a 97mph fast ball to the dome
[4:08:26] <dekkitout> PogChamp

[4:08:42] <person181> i think i cheese this fight
[4:08:46] <Ayy_Nick14> DEAD
[4:08:46] <%shiplord13> This is what happens when you declare Majima's breaker style is too op
[4:08:49] <%TempestaDePrimo> Ornstein and Smough lmfao
[4:08:49] <alcors_wisdom> PAT theres some furniture you can use on the raised area to kill the breaker guy first the heavy dude is pretty weak without him
[4:08:50] <WaxWitch> this is like a Def Jam fight LUL
[4:08:51] <%Metballs> YEAH
[4:08:52] <%ElenaManetta> Spinning on your head as a fighting move is the dumbest
[4:08:53] <omen_setter> damn that was sick
[4:08:58] <%Mornaka> Kiriyu needs a tag team partner
[4:08:59] <%aivalera> Well tahtvwas cool
[4:08:59] <%Plague_Nurse> grab a GUN
[4:09:01] <a_mad_dragon> they have dual techs
[4:09:03] <%weissguard> That's pretty alright.
[4:09:05] <%ElenaManetta> It's like flapping your arms like a bird to elbow somebody in a fight
[4:09:06] <%QaizerArt> @ElenaManetta And the COOLEST
[4:09:06] <$ooblagis> This fight is weirdly difficult
[4:09:08] <%alexandrecau> pat use a weapon
[4:09:13] <lizard0tm> It's like Ornstien and Smough LUL
[4:09:13] <%ElenaManetta> NO JUST THE LAMeST
[4:09:16] <dekkitout> This is like Ornstein and Smough
[4:09:18] <UltraBulldozer> Thing I love most about Yakuza combat is getting interrupted mid combo constantly.
[4:09:19] <Run44forrest> pat use your Gun
[4:09:21] <%QaizerArt> NO IT'S DUMB AND COOL
[4:09:21] <%OwlLightningMage> Elena is super right
[4:09:23] <%QaizerArt> IT'S FINE
[4:09:27] <%TempestaDePrimo> Oi, don't steal my joke
[4:09:28] <%QaizerArt> HELICOPTER KICK
[4:09:28] <%OwlLightningMage> Its just dumb looking
[4:09:35] <%alexandrecau> It's not even a hard fight the super armor is just a bitch
[4:09:37] <%Keyd00d> kiwami 1 boss fights are so bad
[4:09:40] <omen_setter> that guy is so large, yet so fast
[4:09:41] <%TempestaDePrimo> [kidding I dont give a damn]
[4:09:42] <%ElenaManetta> COMB0
[4:09:49] <%Starlight_Gamer> LUL
[4:09:50] <Dhurkst> @Mornaka Majima or Date would have been great
[4:09:56] <+NoxAlchemist> yo this boss fight was annoying as fuck
[4:09:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> get big boi
[4:10:03] <agadejobi> Why is this fat guy so fast
[4:10:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> imagine an alternate universe where Majima and Kiryu switched personalities.
[4:10:05] <circular7> this fight isn't that hard pat, you just kinda suck
[4:10:09] <%ElenaManetta> you're fighting japanese thug abbott and costello over here
[4:10:14] <kite1haseo> this is like Eddie vs King in Tekken
[4:10:16] <majindusto> And this isnt even the most annoying boss fight in the game
[4:10:20] <%QaizerArt> This boss fight sucks because they are using Rush and Breaker styles.
[4:10:21] <%TempestaDePrimo> This is artificial difficulty
[4:10:24] <%aivalera> If you think this is bad, it gets worse. Wait until the bosses start bringing unblackable guns.
[4:10:28] <%startadevy> apatSkelmo
[4:10:29] <Run44forrest> not being able to do kiwami heatmove on nishki because you didnt grind out the komeki dungeon NotLikeThis
[4:10:30] <%QaizerArt> Which are both fast AND hard to hit.
[4:10:34] <ShakiraAkira> Ornstein and Smough?
[4:10:35] <%startadevy> apatSkelmo cohhB
[4:10:38] <omen_setter> Japanese David Spade and Chris Farley
[4:10:39] <$ooblagis> I found the best tactic for this fight was "Kill them both in two Tiger Drops"
[4:10:39] <%aivalera> The original was worse though.
[4:10:45] <dekkitout> They are railing you with their "Deadass, 🅱 Combo"
[4:10:46] <+NoxAlchemist> i remember the gun guys too
[4:10:47] <%startadevy> KAPOW CurseLit
[4:10:47] <%alexandrecau> @rumtumtugnutz surprisingly wouldn't change much aside who cracks joke and who doesn't
[4:10:48] <agadejobi> At least the little one takes the time to dance before attacking
[4:10:56] <blue6sub6remnant6> @omen_setter Underrated comment.
[4:10:56] <+NoxAlchemist> i found them easier imo
[4:11:01] <$RaikenTB> waow
[4:11:06] <aimlesshealer> I'm surprised you can carry that many healing items
[4:11:08] <%starotter70> Isn't there an even WORSE fight later? the one with the gun guy?
[4:11:11] <%ElenaManetta> Long fights are not super fun unless it's in a turn-based RPG
[4:11:17] <majindusto> "Jingu"
[4:11:21] <%ElenaManetta> Like, long Chrono Trigger fights are fun
[4:11:22] <%OwlLightningMage> The gun guy isn't this annoying
[4:11:26] <artoflec> this is the 3rd most frustrating fight in the game for me, but the 2nd worst was in a substory
[4:11:27] <%king_wragles> @aivalera wait... "unBLACKable" guns?
[4:11:28] <%QaizerArt> Long fights just aren't fun period, most of the time.
[4:11:30] <%ElenaManetta> Long Kingdom Hearts "chip away at their health" is not
[4:11:33] <%TempestaDePrimo> Imagine a game like this but with King and Armor King
[4:11:34] <Run44forrest> gun guy is cool

[4:11:36] <+goldenwerewolf> 15% LUL
[4:11:36] <Rincewind1998> The problem with bosses in this series is that you need a COMPLETELY different mindset when fighting them, because if you try to fight them normally you get your shit pushed in.
[4:11:36] <%Plague_Nurse> not dead
[4:11:37] <silverira> youger brother Smough and elder brother Ornstein

[4:11:49] <Run44forrest> he just rolls around like a dumbass
[4:11:52] <%SaltyDongs> dude these two are the shit

[4:12:12] <majindusto> Chrono Cross is Ok
[4:12:18] <Dehlome> bitch are you for real?
[4:12:20] <%OwlLightningMage> It's kinda weird that Chrono Trigger never got a sequel of any kina Kappa

[4:12:26] <%aivalera> @king_wragles I’m not a good typer on phone. Please don’t look at your keyboard to check the positions of the o and a keys.
[4:12:26] <%QaizerArt> @agadejobi okay but did it really, or was it just actually amazing and no one could understand the genius of it
[4:12:32] <$ooblagis> And everyone who says otnherwise is wrong

[4:12:44] <%starotter70> @ooblagis Yeah, especially its battle theme!
[4:12:49] <agadejobi> Do you hear this believer of Chrono Cross, Pat? Berate him on stream!
[4:12:52] <artoflec> i used a lot of weapons in this game elaSmile
[4:12:52] <%ElenaManetta> Are there no items like... molotovs you can just throw to do extra damage real fast in this game
[4:12:56] <+NoxAlchemist> in a good way
[4:12:57] <%Mornaka> Half way there!

[4:13:17] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat could've used weapons. I don't think he has any
[4:13:19] <$ooblagis> Chrono Cross is the best PS1 RPG. It's like XenoGears if XenoGears didn't suck
[4:13:23] <thebehatted> this fight looks like a grind
[4:13:26] <a_mad_dragon> radical dreamers was fucking weird

[4:13:54] <$RaikenTB> you didn't grind enough.
[4:13:56] <%ElenaManetta> I was just thinking fights like this is the reason why "Rare battle items that you horde until needed" stuff would be nice if they existed
[4:14:02] <bearwagon> kiwami means health regeneration bullshit
[4:14:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @blazymaniac the first hour or so is balls hard, don't get too discouraged
[4:14:05] <%starotter70> Glad to see the original game didn't age a day
[4:14:05] <%ElenaManetta> Random grenades or bombs in your pocket
[4:14:06] <silvcrest> If only you had some way to restore heat
[4:14:08] <$ooblagis> @blazymaniac Always fuse, they're demons, they're slaves, not Pokemon
[4:14:13] <%iwishthiswasicq> Oh man, watching this is WAY better than actually fighting them.
[4:14:16] <circular7> stop sacking and it won't be so hard pat Kappa
[4:14:16] <Rincewind1998> @ElenaManetta they exist, it's just guns
[4:14:18] <%TheNewJapanGuy> This is the dark souls of Kiwami
[4:14:20] <majindusto> Should have Pocket Circuit

[4:14:34] <%Keyd00d> no it's fine do
[4:14:35] <Rincewind1998> @AppleBasket no, it's more like a super meter from a fighting game
[4:14:35] <%startadevy> saw some modded dance on the gtaes
[4:14:36] <thebehatted> that's bullshit
[4:14:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> OH NOOO

[4:15:08] <%TempestaDePrimo> wake up flairs lmfao
[4:15:10] <%QaizerArt> @ElenaManetta There are a lot of high damage weapons but the best damage ones either aren't available until the finale or are locked behind the minigames people hate like Shogi or Mahjong
[4:15:11] <%px120> That wakeup move is pure horseshit
[4:15:12] <%Keyd00d> kiwami 1 is so... good...

[4:15:45] <Rincewind1998> If Pat stopped running into the attacks he knows are coming this would have been done by now
[4:15:47] <+Galactor123> Least this isn't a biggie smalls type of fight where the other gains powers
[4:15:50] <+Galactor123> when one dies

[4:20:30] <Deano8817> oh my fucking god is the waiter coming up?
[4:20:30] <%chiluzza> well the triads are big meanies
[4:20:32] <%TempestaDePrimo> Who the fuck
[4:20:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> time for the Triad Filler arc
[4:20:33] <%starotter70> Kiryu very much does not like the chinese
[4:20:35] <%ElenaManetta> the more we know~
[4:20:35] <person181> does anyone
[4:20:36] <%px120> Yeah, fair enough
[4:20:38] <omen_setter> triads are bullies
[4:20:38] <Prevot> does anyone like the triads?
[4:20:39] <%Trtickster> Still got some good air for having a bum leg
[4:20:41] <%Mr_Strut> Who does?
[4:20:41] <Bouldus> the Japanese dont liek the Chinese? who knew? Kappa
[4:20:41] <%badchoice5> First ever Kiryu murder, on its way!
[4:20:42] <%aivalera> ‘Cause they’re chinese
[4:20:43] <$NocturneNovember> The one guy that gets Kiryu fucking SHOOK
[4:20:44] <%snow_bush> Welp, on that note I must sleep. Night all.
[4:20:45] <%shiplord13> They almost Majima-ed him
[4:20:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Whale
[4:20:47] <Dehlome> they were gonna give him the ol' majima
[4:20:48] <artoflec> I found the parrying moves really useful in this Yakuza because enemies are so aggressive.
[4:20:50] <natebud> hey kiryu i need you to go back to Debolah
[4:20:50] <majindusto> Seriously, Lau Ka Long sounded so much better in Yakuza 3
[4:20:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kiryu vs. Wei Shen
[4:20:53] <stabbityrabbit> Oh yeah, that scene really shows they were buttheads.
[4:20:53] <dekkitout> Very bad, those Triads, unlike the noble Yakuza
[4:20:54] <%mercado94> oh boy
[4:20:54] <Run44forrest> HYPE

[4:21:13] <artoflec> You mean the worst fight in the franchise
[4:21:14] <%mercado94> I'm scared

[4:21:20] <circular7> bitterGun bitterGun bitterGun bitterGun bitterGun bitterGun bitterGun bitterGun bitterGun
[4:21:20] <Sleepology> wait what fight?
[4:21:20] <ZatsuHimura> He is not that bad with Rush
[4:21:21] <Run44forrest> the emotional damage too
[4:21:22] <Blank9> the main thing to remember is: kiryu never kills anyone
[4:21:23] <%Metballs> Dante?
[4:21:26] <KeiPrime> i mean the last fight is really bad
[4:21:26] <Tucker0603> HUGS
[4:21:27] <Polengoldur> GUN GUN GUN GUN
[4:21:28] <%alexandrecau> Ypu can make it easy if you unlock time for godspeed
[4:21:28] <%OwlLightningMage> I never thought the gun guy was that bad
[4:21:28] <$NocturneNovember> Which one was it again?
[4:21:30] <Rincewind1998> Beast Style is not broken
[4:21:30] <%Ion_LaserX> THERE'S A WORSE FIGHT??
[4:21:31] <%iwishthiswasicq> Oh, I honestly forgot about GUN
[4:21:32] <waifoong98> Pat brain is leaving his body right now LUL
[4:21:32] <$ooblagis> Which fight?
[4:21:32] <Deano8817> the only saving grace is rush mode makes that fight bearable this time
[4:21:32] <Rincewind1998> now
[4:21:32] <%px120> The FUCKING GUNS
[4:21:33] <%Metballs> That guy was cake compared to the red bros
[4:21:34] <Run44forrest> dmc 2 Dante
[4:21:37] <%Cthulos> is amon not in one
[4:21:39] <NotHereToStream> it was worst in the original
[4:21:40] <%Keyd00d> all the endgame stuff with a billion gun guys is fucking abysmal
[4:21:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its Donte
[4:21:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the boss fight is Donte
[4:21:43] <Run44forrest> tekashi 69?
[4:21:52] <person181> kiryu NEVER KILLS
[4:21:55] <Sleepology> and then majima
[4:21:56] <Tucker0603> !uptime
[4:21:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 21m.
[4:22:06] <%blastazoid26> apatCrazyhead
[4:22:11] <Run44forrest> kiryu doesnt kill people guns kill people
[4:22:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> crazy talk
[4:22:13] <NannerFone> how bad was the fight
[4:22:15] <%Nobrev> you ran from a fight to find a fight
[4:22:26] <$ooblagis> The Bouncer Missions in 2 Kiwami are enough to chap your ass raw, I'll tell you that
[4:22:27] <omen_setter> Kiryu doesn't kill but he does slay
[4:22:32] <%aivalera> @nannerfone It’s fucking awful.
[4:22:35] <%Tenebrae94> @angriestpat what were you saying about the fight?
[4:22:36] <blue6sub6remnant6> "It's a slugger move... wait..."
[4:22:38] <majindusto> Maybe Pocket Circuit isnt so bad now
[4:22:44] <Run44forrest> stock up on redbulls pat
[4:22:48] <waifoong98> @majindusto LUL
[4:22:49] <NannerFone> @aivalera oh wait fuck i remember now
[4:22:50] <%OwlLightningMage> Pocket Circuit plays itself
[4:22:56] <%king_wragles> Kiryu doesn't kill people, he just convinces them to stop being alive by punching
[4:23:03] <NannerFone> oh jesus did they even try to do anything to improve that fight
[4:23:34] <%alexandrecau> Kiryu doesn't kill people, the chinese do while turns around
[4:23:35] <Run44forrest> is there anyone who hasnt played yakuza 1 in here because this next parts prettyy good
[4:23:35] <$ooblagis> Don't pause
[4:23:40] <agadejobi> Wait, what was that fight like before? You didn't have styles in the old version, right?
[4:23:41] <WaxWitch> yes yes all those people fell on a knife and bikes just dropped on them from nowhere
[4:23:41] <%OwlLightningMage> Think that's a counter move? Maybe
[4:23:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> theres a pause tho
[4:23:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[4:23:44] <$ooblagis> Just mash
[4:23:46] <aimlesshealer> what the feeuk
[4:23:46] <%startadevy> oui LUL
[4:23:47] <%aivalera> @angriestpat you have TOO MUCH HEAT
[4:23:55] <CryptusMaximus> Pat are you looking forward to the Cat Cafe quest in Yakuza 6?:D
[4:23:56] <Prevot> why did he drink that
[4:23:58] <$ooblagis> Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong move
[4:24:00] <%ElenaManetta> I wanna fight women in this game. WHERE'S MY GENDER EQUALITY !!!
[4:24:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> then DO pause
[4:24:04] <+AppleBasket> How can you be too hot?
[4:24:04] <natebud> mashing it worked in 0
[4:24:12] <Rincewind1998> It's honestly not that good anyway
[4:24:15] <%Edgy_Macaroon> do it better
[4:24:17] <Tucker0603> YES
[4:24:20] <%mercado94> @cryptusmaximus explain now. CAT CAFE???
[4:24:21] <majindusto> BIG HEAT
[4:24:21] <Tucker0603> HUUUUGS
[4:24:22] <%aivalera> @angriestpat You need to not have climax heat iirc
[4:24:25] <%starotter70> @ElenaManetta i think there's one in this game or maybe 2
[4:24:25] <%Keyd00d> HUG
[4:24:25] <%iwishthiswasicq> That move is the greatest.
[4:24:26] <%QaizerArt> @ElenaManetta You fight a chick named Godspeed Yoko who is probably one of the harder early sidequests.
[4:24:26] <%alexandrecau> No women is dumb enough to pick a fight with Kiryu
[4:24:28] <%chiluzza> he just fucking broke those guys backs
[4:24:29] <bearwagon> bear hug is my favourite
[4:24:29] <%Fidranth> TIGER DROP
[4:24:34] <%ElenaManetta> Have you ever hugged someone so hard you broke their back
[4:24:36] <%Ion_LaserX> apatBig Hug
[4:24:41] <Polengoldur> kiryu never killed anyone, tjat guys just got no spine now
[4:24:44] <Run44forrest> no but that does sound fun
[4:24:49] <%QaizerArt> @ElenaManetta She is literally so fast that she's nigh-untouchable.
[4:24:50] <$ooblagis> That was it, can't be in Red
[4:24:51] <%Keyd00d> SPANK
[4:24:52] <+AppleBasket> That guy is dead
[4:25:02] <WaxWitch> women live longer, not fighting Kiryu is how
[4:25:03] <%ElenaManetta> Does she say YOU'RE TOO SLOW
[4:25:10] <Run44forrest> noooooo
[4:25:12] <%ElenaManetta> play... apex.
[4:25:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Mesuking THO
[4:25:15] <%mercado94> do it
[4:25:17] <$ooblagis> There's guides that do it for you
[4:25:17] <%starotter70> But do it tho
[4:25:19] <Waage83> Do pocket racing you coward
[4:25:20] <+jeapes13> DO IT
[4:25:21] <%QaizerArt> I wish she did, but she mostly just dodges like fucking crazy.
[4:25:21] <%Edgy_Macaroon> do it tho
[4:25:21] <+BaronEgo> HEATHEN

[4:25:22] <KeiPrime> mesuking is awesome you coward
[4:25:22] <$ooblagis> Zero effort
[4:25:22] <%Keyd00d> NO BALLS
[4:25:22] <%Metballs> Then RIP Majima
[4:25:22] <Temjin_Alpha> you need them to max Dragon style
[4:25:23] <Josef_Stryker> DO IT
[4:25:23] <%OwlLightningMage> Pocket Racing is automatic though
[4:25:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> But Pat, Beetle Tendency!!!
[4:25:24] <%iwishthiswasicq> But Mesuking is the best you putz
[4:25:25] <%cryobyjorn> Pocket Racing tho
[4:25:25] <%Skeletorexplains> its the best!
[4:25:26] <natebud> Pocket racing is the worst
[4:25:27] <%badchoice5> Did someone say POCKET RACING???
[4:25:27] <%ssjklyco> But you may get POWERFUL moves
[4:25:28] <%Agami23> play some apex, the real minigame
[4:25:28] <Dhurkst> pocket circuit is good :P
[4:25:29] <%OwlLightningMage> It's super easy
[4:25:29] <Josef_Stryker> Press F to tell Pat to DO IT
[4:25:29] <Darren716> You litteraly have to
[4:25:30] <bearwagon> whut about the coliseum
[4:25:31] <%QaizerArt> @AngriestPat DO MESUKING, IT'S FUCKING EASY
[4:25:33] <%starotter70> Pockt Racing is hype as shit
[4:25:33] <Rincewind1998> Bear hug was super busted with Cyclone sling in 0. Sling could only beused in 2nd gear, and hug could only be used in 3rd. You'd hug a guy, drop down to 2nd gear, then slign another to get right back into 3rd. Repeat until fight is won
[4:25:33] <Brainworm205> FAKE FAN
[4:25:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BEETLE TENDENCY PAT
[4:25:35] <$ooblagis> Build Guides literally tell you how to win
[4:25:35] <dekkitout> Now this is Pocket Racing
[4:25:35] <UltraBulldozer> Pocket racing is Yakuza!
[4:25:37] <artoflec> pocket racing is good but i understand not liking it because its just customization based
[4:25:38] <KeiPrime> pocket racer you can just cheat who cares but mesuking tho
[4:25:38] <%Nobrev> DO IT DO IT DO IT
[4:25:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fake fan
[4:25:39] <+combat_rock> beat the little children at their own games........
[4:25:40] <+jeapes13> you can finish pocket racing in 40 minutes
[4:25:40] <Polengoldur> i still love how idiosyncratic this series can be. my personal highlight was using a golden shotgun to prove that i never shot anybody
[4:25:40] <Run44forrest> can we see the cutscene
[4:25:41] <%Skeletorexplains> fake faaan
[4:25:41] <%starotter70> YES
[4:25:42] <%OwlLightningMage> Just use a guide for them
[4:25:42] <$NocturneNovember> Pat's strong enough already to do endgame anyway right now
[4:25:43] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> DO IT LOSER!

[4:25:54] <%DK_Rance> @polengoldur kiryu literally stabs a dude to death if you use a knife in a fight lol
[4:25:55] <+Blargimazombie> Kiwami means pocket racing
[4:25:55] <%aivalera> I love yakuza kiwami, but the heat exclusive system aggravates me to hell
[4:25:55] <CryptusMaximus> The real side quest content is the Cat Cafe from 6.
[4:25:56] <%OwlLightningMage> Just use the Pocket Racing guide
[4:25:57] <person181> if you want dragon they you do
[4:25:58] <Deano8817> @AngriestPat you can google cheat super hard we don't care
