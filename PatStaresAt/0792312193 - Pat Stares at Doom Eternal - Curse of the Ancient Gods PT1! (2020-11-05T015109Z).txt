[0:34:31] <DocMadfox> Cheer500 Hey Pat, beyond the obvious wishing Paige a quick recovery and demanding you give Zangief pets for me - I found out you tried CK3 then immediately refunded it because it was overwhelming. As someone who plays Paradox Grand Strat games a lot that's entirely fair, and if it's okay, I'd like to recommend starting with Stellaris if you're actually interested in that genre. It's closer to a 4x game with Grand Strat Elements and you can create a race of robot Pat Toilets.
[0:34:40] <+MayorRev> ohhhh ok got it
[0:34:40] <+Pyroclase> So is there a low chance that at any moment a construction work could come crashing through the wall accidentally?

[1:31:25] <%brachydios777> @kingmemelord97 Yes
[1:31:26] <$ringabal> OH SHIT ITS SMT
[1:31:38] <+Pyroclase> The Father is dead but VEGA isn't, it's complicated
[1:31:46] <boogaleeboo> Nah, God is actually cool in this one
[1:31:51] <%GarbageNirvana> You uploaded him into the mainframe remember
[1:31:52] <+American_Saikyo> dead? hes only an AI right now
[1:31:55] <+jpf1256> Angry pupper in the background
[1:31:56] <+TheBitingIrish> ARE WE GONNA FIGHT THE THING?!
[1:32:02] <ataxia72> that's a good feeling
[1:32:02] <+TheBitingIrish> THE THING IN THE POOL?
[1:32:09] <the_Graboid> Vega is GOD
[1:32:13] <peachy996> He lacks a corporeal form, he's just a talking voice right now
[1:32:19] <%Validuntil2077> so why were they using god to manage the argent facility on mars again?
[1:32:19] <%stubborndeer> this game is basically what australia is like but the spiders don't have guns yet
[1:32:28] <Aydarkzero> The Father is just vibing now
[1:32:35] <peachy996> Doomguy did Vega pretty dirty
[1:32:42] <%kingmemelord97> i cant belive doom nerfed god into the shadow realm
[1:32:47] <peachy996> But things must be ripped and/torn
[1:32:55] <peachy996> so fuck'em
[1:33:03] <+American_Saikyo> @validuntil2077 to hide the Father from the Dark Lord
[1:33:21] <%papabigrooster> what happened to vega in the main game again? didn't he get put in something before you fight the giant demon angel thing
[1:33:35] <+Tredecian> this room
[1:33:52] <+Veraverse> I'm totally out of the loop with Doom Eternal story, so yeah...Great game I think SeemsGood
[1:33:54] <%Validuntil2077> @American_Saikyo oh so like hiding in plain sight then
[1:34:04] <Aydarkzero> buffed monkaS
[1:34:09] <peachy996> @papabigrooster you put him in a console in Urdak to open a portal back to earth.
[1:34:12] <+American_Saikyo> yup
[1:34:13] <CrazyMedicine> They become bullet sponges
[1:34:15] <%blaccbird914> thats too mean
[1:34:19] <+ThemDubs> just wait until the final boss lol
[1:34:20] <%AzureGale> He's like "fuck yo ice"
[1:34:22] <%maybefalco> all the anti-fun enemies
[1:34:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> Btich you thought Ice would save you says doom
[1:34:22] <%1matheuw> doomguy kinda abandoned him in urdak
[1:34:28] <%s1rcuit> no it does, that one's just buffed I think @PatStaresAt
[1:34:36] <%Validuntil2077> sweet
[1:34:37] <Josef_Stryker> They are number one problem in every encounter
[1:34:41] <peachy996> Nah
[1:34:46] <Aydarkzero> snek
[1:34:49] <%brachydios777> @papabigrooster Got put into Urdak’s software essentialy
[1:34:50] <$PigGuy800> i hate those shield spawning assholes
[1:34:51] <peachy996> It doesn't freeze Posessed
[1:34:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> That hell knight has the holy ghost and he will not be stopped
[1:34:54] <%AncelDeLambert> there is NOTHING more bullshit than a game randomly saying "Yeah, your kit no longer works at all against this enemy. For reasons"
[1:35:03] <+ThemDubs> use micromissles on spirit demons
[1:35:05] <%kingmemelord97> so the plot is satan has major dadddy issues
[1:35:19] <OverlordedK> oh this is the room I spent like an hour on
[1:35:19] <Aydarkzero> just adapt 4Head
[1:35:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hell knight is a man on the mission
[1:35:21] <%s1rcuit> imagine trying to watch this guy zip around murdering demons
[1:35:23] <Josef_Stryker> Denied
[1:35:30] <boogaleeboo> "Short level"
[1:35:30] <%Grimlockfly> pwned
[1:35:32] <%AzureGale> F
[1:35:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Zapped
[1:35:34] <+Veraverse> F
[1:35:36] <+twohitgood> prepare to die edition is real
[1:35:36] <peachy996> And that's why these guys are pricks
[1:35:36] <Saltmeisterr> Fuckimg deleted
[1:35:38] <%1matheuw> M O R T I S
[1:35:38] <%brachydios777> BOOM
[1:35:41] <%kingmemelord97> it begins
[1:35:41] <ataxia72> evaporated
[1:35:42] <%Piemen99> recked
[1:35:42] <+ThemDubs> Micromissles dont have damage reduction on the spirit demons
[1:35:43] <+ChaosAethr> zap
[1:35:43] <%stubborndeer> isn't doom guy the most powerful hero next to dante and jojo or something
[1:35:44] <%Validuntil2077> gib
[1:35:44] <+HellHunter120> Two rocket launcher Lock-on bursts will kill the possessed Hell Knight
[1:35:44] <%papabigrooster> RIP
[1:35:55] <%AncelDeLambert> no seriously, game, it's bullshit to just STEAL a part of the palyer's moveset
[1:36:00] <%1matheuw> !uptime
[1:36:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 36m.
[1:36:08] <peachy996> Clutch
[1:36:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> Dare I say.....Outplayed
[1:36:12] <+American_Saikyo> @patstaresat gotta wait for his shield to go down
[1:36:12] <+HellHunter120> @ThemDubs Everything has some degree of damage reduction, usually between 50-60%
[1:36:12] <%Validuntil2077> wish the death animation had doomguy shooting out like 12 ribcages
[1:36:19] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[1:36:20] <+StabbityStyle> should play some OG doom with some wads <3
[1:36:20] <OverlordedK> possessed enemies suck
[1:36:21] <%Taisuru> Or maybe it is you who is terrible :V
[1:36:21] <Giztech> clenching your butt cheeks the whole time LUL
[1:36:23] <%AncelDeLambert> tf are you supposed to do about this glowing asshole?
[1:36:25] <%calivsak> Kinda sorta super bad
[1:36:25] <ataxia72> I like them
[1:36:26] <Aydarkzero> i saw a video on the resistances the enemies get when possessed it's pretty nuts
[1:36:26] <%AzureGale> How much more bullcrap can they put in for the next two expansions
[1:36:26] <%stubborndeer> @anceldelambert didn't some metal gear solid guy do that
[1:36:28] <%Konquerer> the spirit is the only thing I don't care for
[1:36:30] <peachy996> Yeah but you gotta hand it to them making the map tougher to deal with
[1:36:32] <%maenos2> pat you no like turrets?
[1:36:33] <%Calek> possessed enemies ruined the dlc for me
[1:36:36] <Make_me_mad> Kinda just awful, like most of the things they did in Doom Eternal.
[1:36:38] <CoronaVirusIsOver> also the artificial difficulty
[1:36:41] <Saltmeisterr> love me some wait and shoot enemies
[1:36:41] <beetus_unlimited> yOu CaNt JuSt sHoOt a HoLe iNtO mArS
[1:36:42] <%AzureGale> Can't wait for the one that kills you if it looks at you funny
[1:36:43] <+malacante> no love for inviblessed snek :(
[1:36:44] <%AncelDeLambert> whaaaaaaaat? A DLC shat out at random has bad enemy balance? gettafugout
[1:36:47] <heart_ablaze> the spirits are cool
[1:37:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> You don't enjoy having your shit compacted by a blue ghost
[1:37:04] <+ThemDubs> lol wait until the final boss lmao
[1:37:09] <peachy996> Microwave Beam still stuns the possessed
[1:37:09] <$ringabal> The S in Spirit stands for Strand
[1:37:11] <valriot> Theyre good enemies they just require better aim which is kinda hard on a controller
[1:37:15] <ataxia72> the spirits are great, make the DLC feel more like a doom mod than it already did
[1:37:19] <+HellHunter120> They've been working on this DLC since March, I wouldn't call it shat out at random
[1:37:23] <peachy996> @ThemDubs OH BOY That's GOING to be Fun
[1:37:35] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the problem I had with the Spiderman DLC, the enemies were pointlessly difficult for no good reason and it was just annoying
[1:37:36] <+ThemDubs> micromissles against the possesed
[1:37:44] <Aydarkzero> so you're doing a Ultra-Nightmare run later right? Kappa
[1:37:45] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck those jet-pack energy trails, man
[1:37:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> Rush down plus Armor and antifreeze what's the problem
[1:38:00] <%AzureGale> Imagine this - what if the spirits looked more like cute kitties
[1:38:10] <coldsoul8239k> Possessed Barons are scary
[1:38:11] <%mighty_max_t> Did the music just kinda die?
[1:38:14] <+duskrush> lock on rocket launcher is a good choice too
[1:38:18] <%stubborndeer> doom 5 : quake 3
[1:38:24] <+Veraverse> hear me out: Succubus for new enemy
[1:38:26] <%logoth_> This is a long encounter huh
[1:38:27] <%1matheuw> CLUTCH
[1:38:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Doomguy is Ghostbuster?
[1:38:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> I don't get Pats problem just shot the enemy
[1:38:36] <+ThemDubs> someone crunched numbers and they don't do reduced damage
[1:38:45] <%AncelDeLambert> micro-missiles were my favorite in 2016, I fear what they've done to them in this game
[1:38:45] <3Xgilly> Is this game safe to redownload on steam????
[1:38:46] <coldsoul8239k> @veraverse Kreygasm
[1:38:46] <%brachydios777> This room is rough
[1:38:52] <+American_Saikyo> @patstaresat use your grenades
[1:38:52] <ataxia72> Pat forgetting he has grenades for some reason
[1:38:56] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat, no run, KILL!
[1:39:01] <%AzureGale> This music bangs though
[1:39:06] <+TheBitingIrish> ikr
[1:39:08] <dinnydanny777> Oh this really does look like Hell
[1:39:11] <Aydarkzero> no cool sword FeelsBadMan
[1:39:18] <%Grimlockfly> yeah, big miss crucible
[1:39:18] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, he's forgetting because this shit is stressful as hell and remembering ALL your weapon options is tough
[1:39:18] <peachy996> Remember: Headshotting the Maykr Drones is a full heal
[1:39:19] <Josef_Stryker> This DLC REALLY makes u miss your sword
[1:39:19] <%Xelig> seriously why did they not at least bring crucible back for a level?
[1:39:25] <%Pookiedaexzile> No Crucible, No Questions only kill
[1:39:31] <Josef_Stryker> Let'
[1:39:34] <%stubborndeer> this looks like a version of hell designed by guichi
[1:39:37] <ExpressNode> I hate when twitch gets fucky when I move to a different tab
[1:39:42] <Josef_Stryker> Let's hope we get it back for Part 2
[1:39:46] <+TheBitingIrish> LUL

[1:39:53] <%brachydios777> LUL LUL LUL
[1:39:54] <Aydarkzero> @ExpressNode it's the worst
[1:39:55] <$PigGuy800> i wouldn't mind spirits if they didn't require the use of a specific weapon and mod to kill

[1:41:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> Or does it feel good to learn the encounter psaUp
[1:42:01] <ExpressNode> I wonder how this game will play on the next gen systems if this gets a patch
[1:42:06] <x10ders> using a controller feels really bad :[
[1:42:14] <peachy996> Microwave Beams Stun Possessed, Maykr Drone Headshot are full heal
[1:42:18] <+American_Saikyo> punch mech mancubus twice and itll kill it@ @patstaresat
[1:42:22] <Buttku> HE DONT MISS
[1:42:28] <%AzureGale> There needs to be a perk that lets you see the life bars of enemies
[1:42:30] <mesamus> pat dont feel bad if you wish to lower it, this level has battles with multiple phases and if you die you restart it all
[1:42:30] <+Tredecian> @PatStaresAt triple rockets might help with bluknight
[1:42:31] <Aydarkzero> does anyone know if Doom Eternal has an uncapped framerate on consoles right now?
[1:42:41] <ataxia72> Pat making me feel like a god for beating this room on my first go (on UV)
[1:42:46] <Aydarkzero> b/c if it does it's gonna be pretty PogCham on next gen
[1:42:49] <%papabigrooster> this is gonna be a loooooong stream
[1:42:53] <%ShootThatZombie> whyyou7Kermitgun whyyou7Kermitgun whyyou7Kermitgun whyyou7Kermitgun whyyou7Kermitgun whyyou7Kermitgun
[1:42:54] <ataxia72> no doubt he will crush a room that I struggled in later tho
[1:42:58] <+Veraverse> @ataxia72 damn
[1:42:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Its like fighting a boss only you're the boss and everything has a heath bar bigger than yours
[1:43:02] <heart_ablaze> @ataxia72 same
[1:43:07] <mesamus> and this is the first section
[1:43:10] <%maybefalco> @AzureGale technically the microwave mod on the plasma gun does that
[1:43:34] <%Pookiedaexzile> He's starting to beleive
[1:43:47] <peachy996> Ironically I think the last SG Room is pretty ez
[1:43:50] <+Veraverse> *He's beginning to believe*
[1:43:56] <%brachydios777> This dlc makes the base game look like a cake walk
[1:44:08] <Aydarkzero> He's beginning to rip & tear
[1:44:14] <%Pookiedaexzile> No, I like mine better
[1:44:16] <+malacante> Spirits also feel weird for the Ghostbusters reference in doom
[1:44:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do you know what we need? a archvile right here
[1:44:34] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[1:44:35] <+HellHunter120> Don't forget about your rocket launcher
[1:44:39] <%craigb31> doesn't this dlc get much much worse than this?
[1:44:48] <ataxia72> two archviles and a doom hunter should spawn right now
[1:44:49] <Aydarkzero> @doc_ock_rokc and one of thems buffed
[1:45:04] <heart_ablaze> @malacante reference?
[1:45:15] <Aydarkzero> throw in a Marauder just in case
[1:45:17] <%Eldalu> Eldalu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey Pat, hope Paige is doing a bit better, and can come home soon!
[1:45:19] <ataxia72> pat just go get the med kit
[1:45:21] <%Validuntil2077> oh fuck
[1:45:25] <peachy996> Bam full heal
[1:45:28] <+malacante> you use the proton pack beam to kill ghost
[1:45:36] <peachy996> Just like that. That's why I love those guys
[1:45:37] <+Veraverse> Would it be too much if they added style meter in the next Doom?
[1:45:45] <Aydarkzero> Casually approach spirit
[1:45:51] <ataxia72> I think someone modded one into this game actualyl
[1:45:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Veraverse ultrakill

[1:51:17] <+duskrush> Narrator: It was in fact too easy
[1:51:27] <%Pookiedaexzile> The Wheels of Fate is turning
[1:51:29] <+American_Saikyo> getting ambushed after getting that life feels very oldschool Doom
[1:51:55] <+Dova573> Remind yoursefl that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[1:52:03] <+duskrush> Enjoy that extra life Pat because it's pure hardship from here on out
[1:52:05] <Saltmeisterr> Looks like what?

[1:52:53] <+slimmixrp> What happened
[1:52:54] <SonicD4> is it because you died and then ran back?
[1:52:57] <WanderingSwordsman> the fight is optional
[1:52:57] <+duskrush> lmao yeah that's a bug
[1:53:02] <+TheBitingIrish> INB4 you got the checkpoint again too
[1:53:08] <CrazyMedicine> AGAIN?!
[1:53:08] <supersparta12345> How do you know it's a glitch?
[1:53:16] <ataxia72> you don't access the key from that area so just don't go back there
[1:53:20] <%chiazam> What’s the bug?
[1:53:20] <+duskrush> because we've gone back
[1:53:24] <+duskrush> and that's not supposed to happen
[1:53:27] <%stubborndeer> pat what is more important in life, building super or building good sandwiches
[1:53:28] <%AzureGale> Another trip through the hentai goo

[1:53:38] <+duskrush> @chiazam the fight restarting in that fightzone
[1:53:41] <peachy996> @chiazam he retriggered the earlier fight LUL

[1:55:35] <+PositiveJCurve> What difficulty is he on? I had to bump it all the way down
[1:55:40] <%logoth_> Gerrstt Bursterrrzzzz
[1:55:43] <%AzureGale> "Don't cross the beams" oh ho ho I saw what Doom did there
[1:55:43] <peachy996> UV
[1:55:48] <Aydarkzero> Ultra Violence i believe
[1:55:53] <Josef_Stryker> Ultra-Violence
[1:56:00] <Meltgar> @PositiveJCurve Pat Level Kappa. But yeah UV
[1:56:12] <%AzureGale> Fucking keys are the best kind of keys
[1:56:15] <peachy996> Try to keep those
[1:56:16] <Oxybe> Spook'em Shoot'ems!
[1:56:20] <Josef_Stryker> I think I vaguely remember this Arena. This one SUCKED
[1:56:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> The game giveth and taketh away
[1:56:20] <peachy996> Maybe use the rune
[1:56:23] <DraxTD> crazy talk working for pat??
[1:56:28] <+TheBitingIrish> doodSad
[1:56:42] <+LandOfTheWay> nothing really matters~ anyone can seeee~
[1:56:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> You asked for more doom
[1:56:50] <+PositiveJCurve> Damn, that’s what I started on
[1:56:53] <%Validuntil2077> give up do it
[1:56:57] <+HellHunter120> Lock on burst!
[1:57:02] <+HellHunter120> It's nearly broken
[1:57:02] <%chiazam> Maybe we don’t finish today
[1:57:07] <peachy996> Microwave Stun works better
[1:57:26] <Meltgar> How buffed do they get with the Ghost?
[1:57:33] <+HellHunter120> 3 lock-ons will outright kill a possessed Arachnotron
[1:57:34] <peachy996> Ah you do you
[1:57:40] <+malacante> I looked it up it's weird
[1:57:43] <peachy996> So far so good.
[1:57:52] <+PositiveJCurve> You can’t freeze buffed enemies
[1:57:57] <%maybefalco> @PatStaresAt i dont know if they fixed it by now, but there was a bug that prevented you from doing the other secret encounter in this level if you reloaded a checkpoint
[1:57:58] <+malacante> the ghosts give different damage reduction depending on the enemy and weapon type
[1:57:58] <SABiscotti> NO John
[1:58:01] <%AzureGale> Yeaaaaah punch taht map terminal
[1:58:08] <%Lizard0TM> demons are RAD
[1:58:10] <Saltmeisterr> escept demons in tightly dressed suits
[1:58:12] <SABiscotti> YOu are the demons
[1:58:15] <+duskrush> time to go in
[1:58:18] <+HellHunter120> After grinding out 2 Ultra Nightmare wins in the DLC, you really gotta figure out the quick and easy way to dispatch those guys
[1:58:22] <+LandOfTheWay> hoo boy, here we go
[1:58:23] <OverlordedK> lotta level left
[1:58:25] <peachy996> This one is not that bad imo
[1:58:28] <Naho_Saenoki> And then John was a zombie
[1:58:34] <+duskrush> PREPARE YOURSELF. This one's actually pretty rough
[1:58:36] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt i love that the use button is the same as the mellee, so it gives the doom guy a I PUNCH vibe
[1:58:43] <OverlordedK> This is definitely the easier of the gates
[1:58:50] <tanarath> 'This looks short'
[1:59:04] <%Validuntil2077> barons are so cool
[1:59:08] <problemagic> shoot them with bullets!
[1:59:09] <ataxia72> this gate isn't that hard actually, and it's really fun. one of my favorites probably
[1:59:21] <peachy996> I think it's because the maykr drones are around is why it's so manageable
[1:59:21] <+malacante> like possessed mancubus gets -80% from ballista, -75% from super shotgun, -70% from chaingun, and -62% from everything else
[1:59:31] <heart_ablaze> the drones here are what make this fight doable
[1:59:31] <keatiestofthegribbles> whens HDoom Eternal
[1:59:36] <peachy996> But soon, the devs start to realize how good the drones are for you
[1:59:47] <+malacante> but some have regular shotgun resist, or no special chaingun resist, I can't really make head or tails of it
[1:59:48] <ataxia72> NICE
[1:59:57] <problemagic> got em with the bullets just like I said
[2:00:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Are they T-posing on you?
[2:00:10] <ataxia72> just dont get hit bro
[2:00:12] <peachy996> Get used to that not like
[2:00:13] <problemagic> you're welcomn
[2:00:18] <%brachydios777> Just you wai psaSmug
[2:00:20] <CrazyMedicine> oh jesus
[2:00:22] <Meltgar> You gotta kill them first Pat Kappa
[2:00:33] <+ChaosAethr> Hell
[2:00:36] <+duskrush> the makyr drones spawn infinitely until you kill the marauder
[2:00:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Can we get a making of for this that's just a laugh track
[2:00:47] <Saltmeisterr> id software seems to really like player CC
[2:00:52] <ataxia72> damn that gargoyle just took a bte out of crime
[2:00:56] <Saltmeisterr> first the purple goop
[2:01:00] <problemagic> he lives
[2:01:01] <+malacante> its p easy to headshot the makyr drones with the ballista
[2:01:05] <problemagic> oo
[2:01:05] <%AzureGale> #teampat
[2:01:07] <+malacante> while you're using it on the Marauder
[2:01:09] <Saltmeisterr> and now this
[2:01:40] <+PositiveJCurve> I forgot how good Pat is at Doom
[2:01:43] <problemagic> fountain good
[2:01:50] <+duskrush> that's why this is so rough
[2:01:56] <peachy996> OK Mon Man
[2:01:57] <+duskrush> they spawn forever until you deal with that marauder
[2:02:00] <%stubborndeer> lol did pat just blame mat
[2:02:06] <problemagic> YEAH
[2:02:07] <%AzureGale> Stop trying to fight me and fight me

[2:05:18] <%stubborndeer> "doom guy killed satan and then came ot earth then jesus died"
[2:05:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> The only real history anyone needs are Civvie videos about games from the 90s
[2:05:31] <%stubborndeer> "then hitler and stuff and then now"
[2:05:34] <%kingmemelord97> i mean he will always be baby mage
[2:05:46] <ExpressNode> Gief filling up his Blood Roar meter
[2:05:57] <BlackMage66652> True
[2:06:07] <problemagic> we literally didn't learn shit about US history between 1900 and now
[2:06:13] <@SoFarFetched> Zangief is around 3 months I believe?
[2:06:14] <BlackMage66652> Perhaps he craves his orbular pillow
[2:06:16] <%stubborndeer> buliding super is like eating a banana, don't do it while you are fighting

[2:20:11] <%trustycoyote> @peachy996 Don't worry. You can pop those sides off and paint them, order new ones, have them airbrushed etc
[2:20:12] <peachy996> That's rad
[2:20:12] <%Lizard0TM> it's fine

[2:20:36] <%Validuntil2077> got it
[2:20:41] <CoronaVirusIsOver> dmc 5 loads in like 5 seconds
[2:20:44] <peachy996> @trustycoyote I guess but it'll still look like a warped ice cream sandwhich won't it
[2:20:48] <devanmuse> "nobody can spill blood inthe luminarium" doomguy: is that a challenge?
[2:20:55] <problemagic> fuck i miss the secret world @maskedsongbird
[2:21:02] <+GuilKato> but Pat .... RAM cache
[2:21:06] <CoronaVirusIsOver> did you see how fast witcher 3 loads on series x?
[2:21:06] <Aydarkzero> ps5 exclusives are gonna be NUTS
[2:21:06] <+TheBitingIrish> Fuck proprietary nonsense
[2:21:12] <crazzmatazz2> do you think the PS5 will really take advantage of it tho
[2:21:21] <maskedsongbird> @problemagic Pretty sure the servers are still running.
[2:21:25] <crazzmatazz2> faster boot will be nice
[2:21:26] <Aydarkzero> good jump Kappa
[2:21:26] <$ringabal> Punch prompt on tree?
[2:21:26] <problemagic> good jumpan
[2:21:26] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Yo that's a head, Pat
[2:21:26] <%maybefalco> tree

[2:21:30] <%trustycoyote> @peachy996 ... that can play games! Yeah ive got nothing. It looks like a modern art piece
[2:21:37] <%mield916> punch the tree dumdum
[2:21:39] <+roguemeatwad> but will the demon souls remake melt current PC's though
[2:21:39] <OverlordedK> this part made me feel dumb for a while

[2:22:01] <$Order_of_Mystery> second punch spot on tree
[2:22:01] <freelancebabymaker> pat
[2:22:01] <problemagic> @maskedsongbird they changed so much with LEGENDS and it stopped being as fun.
[2:22:01] <the_Graboid> Is this a bit?
[2:22:08] <+GuilKato> what did that wall do to you pat why do you keep punching it
[2:22:09] <Aydarkzero> speaking of melting pc's you all see Godfall specs for pc?
[2:22:13] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Well, cliff face
[2:22:15] <peachy996> Yes go to tree
[2:22:22] <maskedsongbird> @problemagic Aw, really? That's a shame.
[2:22:29] <CoronaVirusIsOver> the ps5 is really quiet from what i've read
[2:22:37] <problemagic> im grandmaster subbed so I can go back whenever but it just wasn't as fun anymore

[2:22:49] <ataxia72> jump coward
[2:22:52] <%kingmemelord97> hey is the khan maykr a monster girl ?
[2:22:56] <+roguemeatwad> @Aydarkzero no is it nutz
[2:23:02] <Aydarkzero> sure
[2:23:06] <%AzureGale> 2UP
[2:23:06] <+Pilau32> Godfall requirements are RTX 3090 or an AMD 6000 card
[2:23:09] <maskedsongbird> Okay, so real talk: I kind of slept hard on the return of DOOM with 2016 and Eternal. It looks a lot like Metroid Prime to me. Kinda cool.
[2:23:22] <xain234> cave on the right
[2:23:24] <coreybom> I love how they give you armor, just KNOWING that you was gonna fuck up the first time.
[2:23:40] <problemagic> absolutely check out doom 2016 @maskedsongbird
[2:23:52] <peachy996> Guard those two lives like crazy Pat
[2:23:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Local man too angry to die
[2:23:58] <Aydarkzero> Doom 2016 was my first Doom game it's great
[2:23:59] <ataxia72> make sure your rune is on pat
[2:24:02] <problemagic> same
[2:24:09] <maskedsongbird> @problemagic I will eventually. Got a backlog of shit I need to work my way through.
[2:24:10] <%brachydios777> Rune
[2:24:14] <%trustycoyote> @maskedsongbird I could see why you're making the comparison. The map absolutely screams Prime.
[2:24:26] <ataxia72> I hope you don't immediately lose these lives like I did!
[2:24:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> you not only failed you lit yourself on fire
[2:24:28] <tanarath> man, this level looks short.
[2:24:29] <maskedsongbird> Right?\
[2:24:36] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Play Doom 2016, then play Doom Eternal, then go back and play DOOM 2016 again.
[2:24:38] <%stubborndeer> pat play yakuza on stream please this sucks
[2:24:41] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> You feel like you have super powers
[2:24:44] <%AzureGale> Doom 2016 is what you thought ALL modern FPS's would be
[2:24:44] <%stubborndeer> send a mail to ID telling them it sucks
[2:25:01] <peachy996> @tanarath You'll see why
[2:25:05] <%stubborndeer> no play old yakuza
[2:25:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Step on snek
[2:25:09] <%stubborndeer> again
[2:25:09] <Aydarkzero> Empowered monkaS
[2:25:19] <%BinaryFireball> woolieONEGUY
[2:25:20] <%stephaniesadgirl> Nah this game is fine
[2:25:26] <heart_ablaze> @patstaresat i would suggest using 1 bfg shot for the second secret encounter and save the rest for the boss
[2:25:28] <%Maids4lyfe> I'm here to watch doom shut up
[2:25:28] <tanarath> No, I'm poking Pat because he said it's short.

[2:25:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kiryu CHAN
[2:25:51] <%bread_assassin> Speaking of Yakuza, the English karaoke songs are all out now, and there's quite the disparity in quality among them.
[2:25:51] <%kingmemelord97> how many subs to get pat to play rage 2 on stream
[2:26:02] <lucas18293> so I guess this dlc is pretty long, huh

[2:28:21] <Josef_Stryker> @BigCoffee He's just no longer the main character
[2:28:24] <+BigCoffee> @maenos2 I was really hoping he wouldnt. Kinda stains the new guy's adventure....
[2:28:25] <CoronaVirusIsOver> *getting
[2:28:30] <+Pilau32> His story ended but OBVIOUSLY, its a Yakuza game and Kiryu IS Yakuza
[2:28:31] <%BinaryFireball> I always do subs for japanese games but maybe I will take a gander at the dub this time
[2:28:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Darryl Kurylo?

[2:30:30] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @kingmemelord97 it's called judgement
[2:30:34] <+geistuser> this game seems designed around mouse and keyboard?

[2:34:10] <Saltmeisterr> he angery
[2:34:15] <%mythcreant> its always hubris
[2:34:16] <+HellHunter120> The Father would have stopped him from killing the dark lord
[2:34:22] <maskedsongbird> @heart_ablaze Because John Carmack is secretly a weeb and loves JRPGs
[2:34:22] <mudamudajo> fucky wucky you could say
[2:34:36] <xxshadowxx416> this the cool part of the bible they do talk about in doom slayer 4:20
[2:34:38] <CoronaVirusIsOver> here it comes boys
[2:34:46] <%brachydios777> @heart_ablaze I think because the Father still loves his son and would never let the slayer kill him
[2:34:48] <%stubborndeer> I hear that john carmac once ate an entire computer to better understand them
[2:34:49] <ataxia72> here we go
[2:34:49] <valriot> THESE ROOMS LUL LUL

[2:34:57] <%maybefalco> fuck this room
[2:34:58] <peachy996> Oh maan
[2:34:58] <the_Graboid> This is where it begins
[2:34:58] <%stubborndeer> and his conclusion was that doom needs more polygons and more shaders
[2:35:00] <heart_ablaze> oh shit this paaart

[2:37:36] <maskedsongbird> Now see, this looks like the kind of game where the "murderdick shooter" could be a legitimate weapon.
[2:37:41] <%stubborndeer> PAT THE AI IS TRYING TO STOP YOUR FROM RESSURECTING THE DARK LORD WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME ITS EVIL

[2:38:09] <Saltmeisterr> caco's are barely even a heavy anymore
[2:38:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Vega/father is always a bro
[2:38:11] <%AzureGale> They turned cacodemons into such chumps in this game
[2:38:20] <mudamudajo> @stubborndeer so that Doomguy can kill its dick.
[2:38:30] <%Validuntil2077> Samur is sus, vega is cool
[2:38:38] <Aydarkzero> isn't that why Pain Elementals are in the game now?
[2:38:38] <whiterump> I did, it was amazing

[2:39:33] <%brachydios777> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:39:47] <valriot> No its still Ultra Violence, just git gud
[2:39:50] <tanarath> pat found them!
[2:40:06] <valriot> Pat they do ground aoes when you get near them LUL
[2:40:10] <whiterump> some might say it's cuz you're not on M+K
[2:40:13] <peachy996> UV is tougher but its still the right way to start
[2:40:22] <peachy996> Not for Woolie tho
[2:40:23] <+xBolts4Lifex> God I can't wait to play demos souls next week
[2:40:29] <+xBolts4Lifex> demons*
[2:40:41] <%WhereIsWill> man that "suffer" difficulty is psaBig real LUL
[2:40:45] <CoronaVirusIsOver> i'll play on whatever i feel like
[2:40:50] <+redyoshi5> as some one who played it on ultra violence I cant even imagine what nightmare is like
[2:41:06] <%brachydios777> Lucky
[2:41:07] <%mighty_max_t> That's how I feel about Miles Morales. That game being next week is my main motivation driver right now
[2:41:12] <CoronaVirusIsOver> we all can't be byte me or masterzero
[2:41:16] <dinnydanny777> I imagine it involves an awful lot of running
[2:41:16] <whiterump> Watching woolie suffer with WASD was.... I guess I just grew up differently
[2:41:17] <+xBolts4Lifex> good thing is you don't have to imagine it. Just try it :)
[2:41:20] <dinnydanny777> And jumping
[2:41:28] <+Cobaltor_252> sounds like it would be a nightmare
[2:41:34] <Profmcstevie> Man if you're not into gaming 2020 must have been just PURE ass now that I think about it
[2:41:35] <Zebroneath> nightmare is brutal. too much kiting of possessed demons, tbh
[2:41:44] <%WhereIsWill> psaCaco psaCaco psaCaco
[2:41:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Cobaltor_252 boooooo
[2:41:51] <+NitronStreams> the next Doom game will just call the highest difficulty "CBT"
[2:41:55] <valriot> I'll say Hurt Me Plenty is console, but UV is PC. Weapon switch tech is peak Eternal
[2:42:04] <peachy996> And you're humbleness
[2:42:07] <dinnydanny777> Nightmare is probably people bunny hopping around the stage in loops trying not to get hit like it's Quake
[2:42:08] <OverlordedK> dashing sense of humor?
[2:42:24] <coreybom> @profmcstevie Well netflix and other streaming services HAVE been putting out a bunch of stuff.
[2:42:31] <dinnydanny777> Wow
[2:42:34] <%AzureGale> F

[2:42:38] <CoronaVirusIsOver> why you no pick up armor?

[2:43:30] <whiterump> Spite, Pat
[2:43:31] <valriot> No, its cos you cant hit the keys with your baby hands
[2:43:32] <%NovaKnightmare> Your hubris will be your downfall
[2:43:32] <Aydarkzero> the way they should be played
[2:43:32] <Profmcstevie> You're sure showing them huh
[2:43:35] <whiterump> 's drink of choice
[2:43:43] <Sunstalker> The problem isn't the controller, chat. it's pat. Kappa
[2:43:50] <Rionxgarland> ah so pat is stubborn good to know
[2:43:52] <%Validuntil2077> being suboptimal out of spite is fair
[2:43:56] <the_Graboid> Spite makes everything better
[2:44:00] <+NitronStreams> Pat "living spite" Boivin
[2:44:04] <Saltmeisterr> i like how the music is just there

[2:44:06] <valriot> I mean.. no kap @Sunstalker LUL
[2:44:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did you?
[2:44:09] <peachy996> To be fair this is a room that throws a lot at you
[2:44:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Suprise but sneks
[2:44:20] <%stubborndeer> there needs to be a bonzai buddy thing for games where ellie just follows you around in game and gets in your way
[2:44:22] <%trustycoyote> @Validuntil2077 One could say it's a big dick power move
[2:44:31] <maskedsongbird> Spite is the force that keeps the world turning.
[2:44:32] <dinnydanny777> Why were you just moving backwards and forwards, you aren't dodging anything moving like that LUL
[2:44:51] <Sunstalker> Controller's fine. Plenty of people have good aim with it.
[2:44:52] <+Makasuro> Man it hurts to watch this be played on console
[2:45:08] <%WhereIsWill> he doin it yeyeye
[2:45:12] <%Lizard0TM> he's playing on PC
[2:45:16] <%SomeSageAdvice> lol, it isnt @Makasuro
[2:45:21] <peachy996> @Makasuro It's funny to see players like PNDKetchup trounce this
[2:45:24] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt is the DLC killing any love you had for Eternal? You seemed drained

[2:46:43] <$joylent_blue> m+k gang would make me want to play with controller out of spite tbh
[2:46:45] <ataxia72> I like the bloodmakyr :(

[2:51:49] <Saltmeisterr> although it was nerfed from 2016
[2:51:51] <%Lizard0TM> @JaceDarkstar there is, but it's not worth using in this room
[2:51:52] <maskedsongbird> What's the point of making arcade-style time wasting levels, though? The devs/pubs already got all the money they're gonna get for the game/DLC, lol
[2:51:52] <$realm_forge> @jacedarkstar am,o is incredibly scarce in the dlc
[2:51:53] <+duskrush> the ending to this made all this worth it tbh
[2:51:57] <Saltmeisterr> only carries 60 ammo
[2:51:58] <%Validuntil2077> eh the tyrant in the 5x10 room was the only part that felt trolly to me
[2:51:59] <dinnydanny777> From the windows, to the walls
[2:51:59] <heart_ablaze> I legit had to restart the whole level just so I could have bfg ammo for the boss
[2:52:00] <$realm_forge> Ammo
[2:52:01] <+Breaknoon> are ya winnin son?
[2:52:06] <%UvBenServed> In Part 2, every enemy will have a spirit
[2:52:08] <valriot> Titan mains rise up
[2:52:11] <mudamudajo> Pat believe in the me who believes in you.
[2:52:17] <peachy996> You live too dangerously sometimes
[2:52:18] <%Monkeyweed21> dont get cornered
[2:52:19] <valriot> Put those walls through cover
[2:52:23] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> have you tried run and gun
[2:52:25] <%brachydios777> t101Oof
[2:52:26] <%kingmemelord97> @UvBenServed shhhhh
[2:52:27] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> Pat just be good at the game
[2:52:28] <%maenos2> "easy mode is now selectable"
[2:52:28] <+xBolts4Lifex> Easy mode is now selectable
[2:52:28] <Skitarii_Bro> Elmo how could you?
[2:52:30] <+duskrush> Part 3's probably gonna have 4 Possessed Marauders with buff totems
[2:52:39] <CoronaVirusIsOver> just put on the lowest difficulty like i did :)
[2:52:41] <%Tman451> WELCOME TO DIE
[2:52:43] <ataxia72> easy mode, you can select it now
[2:52:49] <peachy996> "Sentinel Armor now available"
[2:52:50] <+duskrush> the demons will tempt you to use the BFG
[2:52:54] <%butthurtdave> Part 2 has a cute girl pop up in a window and watches you live and she laughs at you every time you die
[2:52:56] <JaceDarkstar> ive just never seen it in eternal play throughs i watched. i tryed to play it but didnt like the feel
[2:53:00] <heart_ablaze> THERE IS NO MEME. DIE.
[2:53:08] <CoronaVirusIsOver> oh yeah i used that armor too
[2:53:22] <+duskrush> there's a "Doom Eternal DLC humiliation" category on pornhuhb
[2:53:22] <peachy996> @JaceDarkstar Most times people want to save it for much later.
[2:53:31] <%Validuntil2077> did hw swap to the weakpoint stun rune?
[2:53:33] <%Lizard0TM> BLOODPUNCH is your friend
[2:53:40] <+duskrush> "Your Girlfriend Makes Fun of Your Doom Eternal LP"
[2:53:41] <JaceDarkstar> @peachy996 understandable
[2:53:45] <peachy996> @JaceDarkstar Some will just save it as a just in case option
[2:53:49] <ulcaban> Making the snake enemies invisible is bullshit
[2:53:51] <black_pariah> @butthurtdave EAZY MODO?
[2:54:00] <dinnydanny777> Doomguy wouldn't get his ass kicked
[2:54:11] <%Lizard0TM> I wish the music was more... bombastic
[2:54:22] <%SirGO0SE> i feel like not enough (any?) games have different animations for when you shoot a dude in the cock
[2:54:23] <+duskrush> Is doomguy better at his own game than Duke Nukem is at his?
[2:54:30] <%Lizard0TM> Andrew Hulshult has made some great music
[2:54:37] <%Lizard0TM> but this is rather lasckluster
[2:54:43] <%Monkeyweed21> "Girlfriend finds your stream archive and makes fun of your lame skills POV"
[2:54:44] <%kingmemelord97> @SirGO0SE yeah bulletstorm
[2:54:45] <%brachydios777> @duskrush yes
[2:54:56] <%stubborndeer> yes dusk but only because people keep shooting up his ride
[2:54:56] <peachy996> This theme is the weakest of the 3 that's for sure
[2:54:56] <ataxia72> I think the music in this DLC is great, this room just doesn't have the particularly best track
[2:54:57] <maskedsongbird> @duskrush That's kind of a low bar to hit, lol
[2:55:00] <+duskrush> it's not that the music is bad, it's just not as good as Mick Gordon's
[2:55:02] <peachy996> But I still like it
[2:55:13] <mudamudajo> As bonkers and far fetched as it would be. I'd crack up at some reference or easter egg of Doomguys friendship with Isabelle in game.
[2:55:19] <ataxia72> pat ignoring the glory kill on that caco is peak pat
[2:55:22] <heart_ablaze> good music, but not great
[2:55:22] <%stubborndeer> duke did single handedly beat an alien invasion though
[2:55:32] <ataxia72> and he died because of it
[2:55:35] <+MisterAvry> you got robbed on that cacodemon
[2:55:35] <Zebroneath> that was fucked
[2:55:36] <%third_impact_762> cause you missed it the first stun
[2:55:36] <%Monkeyweed21> yes pat run into the enemies over and over
[2:55:36] <+duskrush> the BFG TEMPTATION
[2:55:38] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> baby time
[2:55:39] <%brachydios777> t101Oof
[2:55:41] <+duskrush> It'd be so easy
[2:55:41] <maskedsongbird> DA BABY
[2:55:44] <peachy996> Bright side is you're almost done
[2:55:45] <heart_ablaze> it gets worse
[2:55:46] <+duskrush> just to hit the BFG button
[2:55:47] <+duskrush> but dno't
[2:55:48] <+duskrush> don't
[2:55:50] <%Lizard0TM> The baby
[2:55:58] <+duskrush> yeah you are in fact almost done
[2:56:05] <tanarath> It's ok, Pat. we came here for this.
[2:56:08] <%third_impact_762> actualy just use bfg here probably bigest fight you have left
[2:56:16] <Profmcstevie> Mmmm baby gives the relax feelings and the cat hair in mouth mmmm~
[2:56:16] <%mike2hands> i feel this dlc is packed with everything and no too much space to work on the levels
[2:56:30] <%trustycoyote> @duskrush "Get behind the Satan! Do not tempt me!"
[2:56:30] <heart_ablaze> 1 more encounter after this and your good
[2:56:32] <keatiestofthegribbles> andrew schultz ost is pretty good imo
[2:56:34] <peachy996> Wow nice jumpin from the Mancubus
[2:56:37] <%Spydurman> I wish we had the Pat cam going so we could see his weird faces
[2:56:41] <mudamudajo> Extra difficulty
[2:56:50] <Profmcstevie> Suffer father HahaCat
[2:56:50] <%AzureGale> Pat gon' sneeze
[2:56:50] <+duskrush> I'd give it an hour and a half if Pat absolutely fucked up every encounter from here on out multiple times
[2:56:54] <maskedsongbird> I really like the slo-mo effect that comes with the weapon select wheel.
[2:57:01] <+duskrush> Couldn't blame him though
[2:57:05] <+duskrush> this dlc is legit hard
[2:57:06] <%DianaTheAscian> those things have a melee attack?
[2:57:11] <Zebroneath> Maybe switching out the 4th rune will help this fight?
[2:57:15] <keatiestofthegribbles> yes
[2:57:17] <%ArchimerCXV> only advice i have which isn't 'Git Gud lol' or 'just use BFG' would be to swap out that support rune you're not getting the benefit of with no lives rn
[2:57:22] <peachy996> @duskrush I give it 2 accounting for the final boss
[2:57:23] <%NovaKnightmare> Use the BFG u BFC
[2:57:24] <mudamudajo> Anus destruction
[2:57:31] <%Monkeyweed21> yes pat run into the enemies over and over
[2:57:39] <black_pariah> pat seems like he's sticking in place more often than normal
[2:57:50] <%Lizard0TM> maybe get the bloodpunch health rune as well?
[2:58:00] <maskedsongbird> He's trying to kill the enemy by smashing them with his face.
[2:58:08] <+MisterAvry> I accept the reason pat
[2:58:10] <+duskrush> you will in fact need it later
[2:58:10] <maskedsongbird> Does not appear to be working.
[2:58:11] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> the goblins
[2:58:11] <%Hiro01231> You will.
[2:58:11] <+griffball13> but you need it now
[2:58:11] <+Tredecian> you need it now
[2:58:12] <%AzureGale> looooooooooooooool
[2:58:14] <+Nomad_Scholar> This is later @PatStaresAt
[2:58:15] <%third_impact_762> cause if you dont use it here you just wont use it for the rest of the game
[2:58:15] <+MisterAvry> do what you gotta do
[2:58:15] <%Validuntil2077> but what if you need it later
[2:58:17] <+duskrush> which is why we aren't complaining
[2:58:17] <%DianaTheAscian> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:58:18] <fortheboyzs> good point
[2:58:18] <SonicD4> and you will need it later
[2:58:19] <%stephaniesadgirl> You will need it later
[2:58:21] <%wruce__billis> To be fair to pat this room is obvious BFG bait
[2:58:21] <%WhereIsWill> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:58:24] <+TheBitingIrish> Saving the BFG shot for part 2 LUL
[2:58:24] <%Spydurman> LUL
[2:58:26] <worsealex> Now is the time you have been saving it for though
[2:58:26] <heart_ablaze> YOU DO NEED IT LATER
[2:58:27] <+rothgarbloodfire> dont let the mind goblins win pat
[2:58:27] <%brachydios777> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:58:30] <+duskrush> he WILL need it later
[2:58:30] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> you will need it later
[2:58:32] <%papabigrooster> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:58:35] <worsealex> Now *is* later
[2:58:36] <%third_impact_762> this is a better apilcation here than later
[2:58:36] <HighDrated_TK> Remember your dashes Pat
[2:58:37] <$realm_forge> What if you need it now tho?
[2:58:38] <%AzureGale> Pat will reach the final boss and be like "WHAT IF I NEED THE BFG LATER"
[2:58:47] <%Validuntil2077> goblins correct this time
[2:58:55] <+TheBitingIrish> Oof, crusty
[2:59:05] <+duskrush> instead of strafing, just keep running forward and shoot any demons in front of you
[2:59:05] <%Lizard0TM> The rune that gives you health for Bloodpunch might help
[2:59:08] <%third_impact_762> best use for a bfg shot woould be if he gets hit when totam pops up
[2:59:09] <%Spydurman> Doom Eternal and the DLC felt like ID Software trying out a lot of new ideas some good some bad. Ghost and Empowered demons not great. Acid and swimming sections not great. But there's a lot to like
[2:59:10] <+duskrush> that way you won't back up into anything
[2:59:13] <+Pyroclase> it's mostly for making it more of a panic button, which generally isn't very helpful
[2:59:26] <black_pariah> every other time playing doom he's been super mobile, but here's he's going all "last stand" over and over
[2:59:33] <the_Graboid> Try confidence.
[2:59:36] <+Pyroclase> @Spydurman empowered demons were actually added a few months ago
[2:59:51] <+TheBitingIrish> I fucking hate the zombies that shoot
[2:59:51] <boogaleeboo> no confidence
[2:59:53] <black_pariah> its okay to run pat
[3:00:02] <+duskrush> to me, this dlc feels like they saw that people weren't using half the options and tactics in the base game and just mowing down opponents with the turret and super shotgun, so they said "Y'ALL GONNA LEARN TODAY" and now you have to use everything you have to live
[3:00:09] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> full confidence
[3:00:13] <maskedsongbird> Big run. Be the coward you were meant to be, Pat.
[3:00:19] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat pls
[3:00:20] <+MisterAvry> you got ate
[3:00:20] <OverlordedK> LUL
[3:00:20] <+slimmixrp> LOL
[3:00:22] <%ShineTheDiamond> Ooooofff
[3:00:24] <+duskrush> keep running forward Pat
[3:00:26] <peachy996> Yeah you do
[3:00:28] <black_pariah> RIGHT INTO THE JAWS
[3:00:28] <+LandOfTheWay> no confidence

[3:00:31] <%DianaTheAscian> COMBO PogChamp
[3:00:33] <heart_ablaze> be a coward pat

[3:00:38] <%mike2hands> psaBig PJSalt
[3:00:40] <peachy996> This room is about setting priorities
[3:00:40] <$realm_forge> OM NOM NOM
[3:00:42] <+duskrush> remember in Doom 2016 when enemies could glory kill YOU
[3:00:46] <%Spydurman> @Pyroclase right but I'm talking new ideas in general not just here in the DLC
[3:00:46] <the_Graboid> No confidence
[3:00:48] <%wruce__billis> @duskrush Good. Complacency isn't Doomguy
[3:01:06] <mudamudajo> The DOOM dance pat. Remember the DOOM dance...
[3:01:12] <+TheBitingIrish> @duskrush INB4 armored Caco's that can ONLY be killed by being fed a grenade LUL
[3:01:19] <$realm_forge> DODGE DUCK DIP DIVE AND DODGE
[3:01:24] <peachy996> Did you see the Maykr Angel has Glory Kill Animations?
[3:01:26] <heart_ablaze> @duskrush we don't use half of the stuff because we all know it kinda sucks
[3:01:54] <%stubborndeer> this is like that one time bruce lee beat up everyone in a town because they stole his tea
[3:01:57] <+duskrush> this dlc was the only time I used the ballista
[3:02:05] <ataxia72> had to step away for a bit, has pat killed the buff totem yet
[3:02:07] <SonicD4> that was stylish
[3:02:08] <+MisterAvry> are the demons turning on each other sometimes?
[3:02:16] <%ShineTheDiamond> How are the dog and cat handling being without Paige? I bet Elmo already peed somewhere random to show his distaste.
[3:02:19] <$ringabal> oh lawd
[3:02:21] <+TheBitingIrish> @duskrush Ballista fucking WASTES Pain Elementals
[3:02:30] <peachy996> Sometimes the demons will fight each other for a bit
[3:02:49] <+duskrush> never stop never stopping
[3:02:50] <+TheBitingIrish> Yea, but infighting only damages partszx, not actual HP
[3:02:57] <+duskrush> just like Hades, never stop dashing
[3:03:03] <+TheBitingIrish> But that's still useful
[3:03:04] <$realm_forge> I got through this one spamming flame belch and remote rockets
[3:03:07] <+twohitgood> the shield guys are pure cancer
[3:03:11] <peachy996> True but I love Infighting as a concept
[3:03:21] <peachy996> It's nuts to see your enemies fight each other
[3:03:25] <%stubborndeer> not being able to kill shield guys is a failure of the game design
[3:03:26] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:03:27] <%kingmemelord97> went and grabed a soda did plot happen ?

[3:05:25] <+LandOfTheWay> @AncelDeLambert you might say it makes you Mad As Hell Kappa
[3:05:28] <%AncelDeLambert> like, is this DLC MEANT to be taken at a pace of one arena a day? Cuz that's how this feels to watch

[3:06:01] <mudamudajo> @anceldelambert It basically picks up from the difficulty at the end of the main game. With a dash of get fucked.
[3:06:02] <%SirGO0SE> nice shot for a console gamer Kappa
[3:06:10] <%AncelDeLambert> is the auto-aim that forgiving or is Pat just that on point this round?

[3:08:18] <%Lizard0TM> and then the baron finished him off
[3:08:18] <%Spydurman> LUL

[3:08:34] <%Kangumosa> psaCrazyhead
[3:08:35] <akitanito> That hurt my soul good
[3:08:37] <+duskrush> never stop moving until everything is dead
[3:08:38] <the_Graboid> It gets way harder still...
[3:08:58] <%kingmemelord97> at the towers \
[3:08:58] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> tilt even further patrick
[3:09:02] <%Kangumosa> Shit N Scare
[3:09:04] <%WhereIsWill> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[3:09:05] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[3:09:05] <%AzureGale> Pat choked
[3:09:05] <@SoFarFetched> so tilted he's gonna turn into a pinball machine sooner or later Kappa
[3:09:08] <%third_impact_762> throw some hate downrange
[3:09:18] <%mike2hands> YOU CAN DI THIS PAT
[3:09:20] <heart_ablaze> 5th times the charm Kappa
[3:09:24] <+duskrush> iirc you can't chainsaw the blood makyrs
[3:09:26] <%AncelDeLambert> This is like last night when Joel had to give up on Spelunky because he just started eating shit
[3:09:27] <$realm_forge> Goooood let the hate floooow through you
[3:09:29] <%papabigrooster> you were saying something about this being the final stream pat
[3:09:29] <the_Graboid> This is supposed to be the easy section
[3:09:30] <+duskrush> at least not while shielded
[3:09:40] <%kingmemelord97> he is this vod gonna be sub locked ?
[3:09:41] <+duskrush> easy is relative
[3:09:47] <+duskrush> it's easy relative to everything after it
[3:10:01] <%Lizard0TM> all vods are sublocked for the time being no?
[3:10:08] <mudamudajo> Literally rip and tear... UNTIL IT IS DONE.
[3:10:18] <@SoFarFetched> yeah currently,Pat hasn't said otherwise. There is also waiting for it to be uploaded onto youtube.
[3:10:56] <+Just_GR> I'm a newbie to this whole thing. Does sublocking VODs actually help with DMCA shenanigans?
[3:11:06] <+MisterAvry> this music is kinda weak
[3:11:12] <+duskrush> i guess for context this section took me one try. the next section took me...a while...
[3:11:12] <heart_ablaze> @lizard0tm yeah, due to DMCA bullshit
[3:11:18] <%WhereIsWill> still pulled it off nice
[3:11:21] <%AncelDeLambert> copyright, especially in regards to music, is so unbearably broken online right now. You'd think they'd have the SENSE to just charge you a reasonable sum for a one time or year license to the property, but NOPE, FULL RIGHTS TO THE VIDEO GIMME MONEY
[3:11:34] <+duskrush> this dlc ain't fucking around
[3:11:54] <%Lizard0TM> MOVE PAT GO
[3:11:56] <$realm_forge> Pat is now locked in with 3 barons fresh from hell’s fuck pits

[3:12:15] <+duskrush> now just land the triple baron
[3:12:18] <%AncelDeLambert> "...I'd like to give you money, let me give you money for music." "NO! Give all ad revenue, take this strike on your channel fuck you GIVE MONEY!"
[3:12:18] <%AzureGale> HAVE CONFIDENCE
[3:12:27] <ulcaban> Shoot angel, get candy
[3:12:31] <+duskrush> backed up into a portal
[3:12:31] <%Monkeyweed21> then stop doing it\
[3:12:33] <%chiazam> Still goin' huh

[3:13:13] <%calivsak> WHELP
[3:13:16] <%Monkeyweed21> stop running at an invincible enemy
[3:13:17] <%AzureGale> NO CONFIDENCE
[3:13:18] <+MisterAvry> you need that slowdown for those angel fuckers
[3:13:18] <the_Graboid> Need a break?
[3:13:19] <%Lizard0TM> This is the EASY room
[3:13:20] <%Lizard0TM> woof
[3:13:21] <tanarath> CRAZY TALK
[3:13:23] <Josef_Stryker> This part is BRUTAL
[3:13:25] <%WhereIsWill> ngl ya got wrecked there mate
[3:13:28] <ataxia72> Pat you need to move around when doing this, just keep jumping and flying around the room
[3:13:30] <Zebroneath> I dunno if a triple Baron is worth a BFG
[3:13:35] <%stardustcrusad3r> i know for the sequel lets make doomguy a bitch
[3:13:36] <tanarath> pat, don't stop to aim
[3:13:37] <Josef_Stryker> I won't think any less of u if u lower the difficulty
[3:13:39] <Noogiez> yooo
[3:13:40] <Josef_Stryker> :)
[3:13:42] <%stubborndeer> >double barons
[3:13:50] <the_Graboid> Have you tried shooting them?
[3:13:57] <%Lizard0TM> triple barons fucking suck
[3:14:09] <tanarath> @stubborndeer three, not two
[3:14:09] <peachy996> if you can freeze a Baron you shouldn't have to use BFG
[3:14:10] <%stubborndeer> is this triple hell?
[3:14:11] <%AzureGale> PAT GOT THE ARMOR
[3:14:15] <$realm_forge> GO PAT SHOW THEM THE PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE WRATH OF CANADA
[3:14:20] <%stubborndeer> ah
[3:14:22] <ataxia72> Pat's insistence on running into crowds of enemies will never stop baffling me
[3:14:32] <+duskrush> just keep strafing around teh outside, don't let them box you in
[3:14:38] <+duskrush> and don't get greedy
[3:14:40] <%stubborndeer> without tank controls pat can not combat large amounts of enemies
[3:14:54] <%Lizard0TM> he didn't deserve that headshot lmao
[3:15:00] <%Validuntil2077> that was a generous hitbox
[3:15:26] <+duskrush> oh wow
[3:15:28] <+duskrush> I never thought of that
[3:15:47] <+Dova573> Experimenting do you do it MOTHERFUCKER
[3:15:51] <+Dova573> ?
[3:15:53] <%third_impact_762> how is that better than a rifle shot?
[3:15:59] <tanarath> YOU HAVE BEFORE @patstaresat
[3:16:15] <%third_impact_762> thats fair if your up close on em i guess
[3:16:17] <+Dova573> New tech
[3:16:21] <%AzureGale> F
[3:16:22] <%dj_xo98> normal ballista shot will kill it too
[3:16:23] <duraju> so much better
[3:16:28] <supersparta12345> The first time you killed one u used shotgun lol
[3:16:29] <the_Graboid> You have to time the explosion tho
[3:16:29] <%calivsak> Elmo luck for the win
[3:16:32] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> this are baby gaem just be perfect
[3:16:37] <+BizmarkTheGreat> Opinion On REmake 3
[3:16:40] <duraju> yea i found ballista to be best
[3:16:54] <+Dova573> Honestly the zoom in rifle was my least used weapong because i love micro missiles too much
[3:16:56] <peachy996> I prefer rifle shot for the accuracy
[3:16:58] <heart_ablaze> eait you guys didn't know you could do that?
[3:16:59] <%Lizard0TM> Remake 3 is okay
[3:17:00] <whiterump> STEVE HOLT
[3:17:02] <%Lizard0TM> not as good as 2
[3:17:11] <%third_impact_762> @duraju there you go thats best of both
[3:17:13] <xxshadowxx416> remake 3 it a action game
[3:17:14] <+BizmarkTheGreat> agreed
[3:17:23] <%Validuntil2077> Falmethrower Nemmy was cool
[3:17:23] <heart_ablaze> thats why the stick bomb is so god teir
[3:17:25] <+BizmarkTheGreat> so was 6
[3:17:35] <the_Graboid> Oh, there will be plenty of spirits later.
[3:17:43] <$realm_forge> empowered spirit possessed marauder
[3:17:53] <%Lizard0TM> You can use the sticky bomb on the Makyr bots too
[3:17:59] <xxshadowxx416> if they make a dmc like remake 3 I think it will be ok

[3:21:55] <%Lizard0TM> it was so loud
[3:21:56] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, I admit that I'm thick as a steel beam, but isn't this game designed around the philosophy that every enemy has a hard counter from a specific weapon?
[3:22:03] <%maenos2> I've gotten used to it thouvh
[3:22:05] <%Lizard0TM> sleep
[3:22:10] <peachy996> It is

[3:46:54] <$ringabal> Hack your way into Hell
[3:47:03] <%Fooguwu> hell wasnt ready for robots
[3:47:10] <+Pyroclase> I really prefer the 2016 version of Sam, honestly. The seraphim stuff just doesn't do it for me.

[3:47:46] <ataxia72> Pat is gonna hate this fight
[3:47:46] <samuelfisk> Agreed. I think it’s way more impressive if Sam made his way through hell with the power of transhumanism and guns
[3:47:47] <+WackyGear> so was hayden good?

[3:55:44] <%Dakuu75> 10/10 I am entertained
[3:55:49] <Josef_Stryker> This boss is the WORST
[3:55:52] <%Validuntil2077> at least it stars a phase 2
[3:55:55] <%mighty_max_t> god, one of my roommates is using the microwave and it's been dropping my wi-fi for the last 5 minutes
[3:55:56] <+MisterAvry> wait is this an Ornstein and Smough phase?
[3:56:08] <%mighty_max_t> I haven't even seen a full round of the Sam boss fight yet
[3:56:08] <$realm_forge> Woolie is gonna have a fun time with this dlc
[3:56:15] <%trustycoyote> @MisterAvry Sorta
[3:56:15] <%Lizard0TM> Remember Blood Punch
[3:56:23] <%AzureGale> Those lifebars at the top should be for the possessed demons and not the spirits :x
[3:56:25] <thesoul2025> Use ice on the knight
[3:56:36] <Noogiez> damn yo
[3:56:37] <+duskrush> you won't win that trade
[3:56:39] <valriot> SO I START BLASTIN

[3:56:40] <%calivsak> Punch the big guy
[3:56:45] <%trustycoyote> Ice doesnt work on possessed
[3:56:45] <%Lizard0TM> Ice doesn't work on possessed enemies
[3:56:47] <%brachydios777> t101Oof
[3:56:49] <%chiazam> why is pat's plan stand still and dps race???
[3:56:50] <duraju> chaingun too slow
[3:56:54] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> cant use ice when hes possessecd
[3:57:05] <%R3Roundabout> Why are you standing still while they fire at you?
[3:57:07] <peachy996> @Lizard0TM But it will on a normal one I think he means
[3:57:13] <%Lizard0TM> Holy shit the knight tossed aside the zombie
[3:57:14] <geassguy360> a checkpoint at the start of each phase is pretty much the only way they could get away with the difficulty of this fight
[3:57:16] <%Lizard0TM> lmao
[3:57:19] <ulcaban> Are ya winnin, Pat?
[3:57:19] <heart_ablaze> since its been stated that sam is gods right hand man, does that mean that sam is technically Jesus?

[4:01:32] <%Lizard0TM> Yes
[4:01:35] <+ThemDubs> its not worth charging the ballista
[4:01:38] <%Das_Bass> Das_Bass subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[4:01:44] <penitentpendant> Time to level WVR again
[4:01:47] <%brachydios777> Vega remembered he’s God
[4:01:51] <thesoul2025> Use the tracking rockets on the boss
[4:01:54] <geassguy360> i ignored the blood maykrs
[4:02:01] <$Xxstevo69xX > use homing rockets
[4:02:06] <%AzureGale> Maybe just focus on hurting the boss
[4:02:13] <%Validuntil2077> so did Sam demon up for this fight or is he just a demony looking Makyr now?
[4:02:29] <heart_ablaze> @thesoul2025 the lock on is useless for sam because he keeps teleporting
[4:02:31] <$Xxstevo69xX > focus on the boss, don't worry about the blood maykrs
[4:02:43] <%brachydios777> @validuntil2077 Mutation via dying
[4:02:43] <%Lizard0TM> that was bullshit
[4:02:49] <geassguy360> the maykrs will just keep coming, better to focus on Sam
[4:02:51] <valriot> LUL
[4:02:51] <%barrakuta371> F
[4:02:52] <bisexualsolidsnake> watch out
[4:02:55] <+slimmixrp> Slow mo
[4:02:56] <%arcielardor> there's one more phase after this, pat
[4:03:00] <%wruce__billis> Why are you wasting time killing the endless waves of blod martyrs
[4:03:00] <+cade_calrayn> @Validuntil2077 he reassumed his original Maykr body, and as a result he ended up suffering the same fate as the other Maykrs
[4:03:00] <duraju> focus on sam only
[4:03:01] <%brachydios777> F
[4:03:01] <+duskrush> good thing this checkpoints after phases
[4:03:04] <BurdRightsActivist> don't get hit 4Head
[4:03:05] <+cade_calrayn> so he mutated
[4:03:06] <+twohitgood> does pat still have bfg ammo?
[4:03:07] <$Xxstevo69xX > correct
[4:03:08] <%calivsak> REMEMBER YOUR 5 Ds PAT
[4:03:11] <xxshadowxx416> he did the move
[4:03:12] <%MonsterEnvy> Mayykrs just look like that under the armor
[4:03:13] <%Validuntil2077> gotcha
[4:03:26] <+duskrush> the fodder doesn't stop, just focus on sam
[4:03:26] <%R3Roundabout> Beating the boss requires you to beat the boss
[4:03:29] <peachy996> You keep going for that blorb
[4:03:59] <+cade_calrayn> what's happened to Seraphim is why the Maykrs were gathering Argent energy in the first place, it helped them stave off this transformation
[4:04:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> so I feel like I really missed out on an opportunity to give ninja shit when he suddenly turned on Fortnite because Riot paid him more money to play Valorant.
[4:04:17] <geassguy360> burnin em down

[4:09:07] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Finally, Doom actually captures the torment of hell
[4:09:08] <DXLelouch24> MUCH WORS
[4:09:09] <penitentpendant> Infinitely INSTANTLY respawning Adds is a TERRIBLE idea for a boss mechanic
[4:09:10] <heart_ablaze> one criticism i have for doom eternal, its bod
[4:09:11] <ataxia72> get the blorb dude
[4:09:12] <%AzureGale> This fight needs more Marauders

[4:09:19] <%luftraumm1> doom but slow and methodical
[4:09:21] <+duskrush> pat get the damn orb
[4:09:31] <+NitronStreams> pretty sure subjecting someone to this fight would be considered a war crime in several countries
[4:09:31] <Profmcstevie> Where in the wooorld is Sam Hayden SingsNote
[4:09:39] <%maybefalco> i would rather take on 5 marauders than finish this fight
[4:09:42] <%Validuntil2077> we never did get to just fight Crucible-wielding cyborg Sam huh?
[4:09:44] <%Monkeyweed21> The orbs and blood maykr give ammo\
[4:10:01] <heart_ablaze> when it comes to doom eternal, it's boss fights no where as good as the boss fights from 2016
[4:10:01] <%dekkitout> This is one of those "This wasn't built with gamepad that much in mind"
[4:10:14] <%FoolsArcade> Since its everything you hate, that means its Bethesda approved!

[4:19:46] <$Gabe36578> !uptime
[4:19:46] <peachy996> Perfect choices for Possessed Demons, Dread and Pain
[4:19:46] <%maybefalco> i don't think anyone would care if you dropped the difficulty, this entire fight is bullshit
[4:19:46] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 19m.
[4:19:49] <%luftraumm1> you best try involved unmaker and backpedaling
[4:19:55] <peachy996> Because that is what this fight is
[4:20:07] <%wruce__billis> Dark Side Pat
[4:20:10] <+slimmixrp> P a i n
[4:20:15] <+Pyroclase> I just cowarded out and used sentinel armor for this fight, won't even lie
[4:20:16] <VirtuaRailith> this looks fucking impossible

[4:20:50] <peachy996> I eventually got lucky on this and beat it. Second time around was much harder
[4:20:56] <%calivsak> Imma be honest, I needed bitch boi Sentinel Armor for this one
[4:20:58] <mudamudajo> How many deaths till Sentinel armor? Or does that not happen on UV?
[4:21:06] <%butthurtdave> Starting to feel like this may be a bit too much
[4:21:14] <RyuuAoi> FUQ
[4:21:22] <%Lizard0TM> you absolutlely get prompted for sentinel armor on UV
[4:21:23] <$Gabe36578> @calivsak console or pc?

[4:22:47] <DSD24> This ghost mechanic is lame
[4:22:57] <boogaleeboo> That's the best you've done in awhile, and it's because you went in super hard from second one
[4:22:57] <%calivsak> calling it, this is the run
[4:23:01] <%Dakuu75> Did Pat have to lower the difficulty for the DLC? or no?
[4:23:10] <boogaleeboo> no, uv
[4:23:12] <DSD24> But I'm biased cause I never used the beam
[4:23:13] <geassguy360> U CAN DO IT PAT

[4:24:15] <%Higure_yoru> Demon of the godam month right there////
[4:24:16] <%arcielardor> wow
[4:24:17] <%R3Roundabout> Time to lower difficulty off stream
[4:24:18] <peachy996> So Chat....Should Woolie play on Normal or Easy?
[4:24:19] <%trustycoyote> @AzureGale Hell Knight stomp\
[4:24:20] <$Gabe36578> you betcha
[4:24:21] <whiterump> get that salt outta your wounds
[4:24:27] <+freelancer_960> its a bad idea to chainsaw for health
[4:24:28] <%Lizard0TM> I hate both the Dread Knight and the bastard that spawns the shield
[4:24:29] <Jflaskd13> easy
[4:24:29] <+LandOfTheWay> ! WARNING: SODIUM LEVELS CRITICAL !
[4:24:30] <+NitronStreams> Soul Damage
[4:24:30] <tanarath> easy
[4:24:31] <star87if> is stream over?
[4:24:32] <$realm_forge> Pat must dump his rage into the toilet
[4:24:34] <%Lizard0TM> worst enemies in the game
[4:24:35] <geassguy360> yeah theres a reason they call this dlc Plutonia hard
[4:24:36] <boogaleeboo> It's a super simple fight, but that is the worst
[4:24:37] <$Gabe36578> easy with sentinel armor
[4:24:40] <%SirGO0SE> psaFist psaPat psaHoldon
[4:24:41] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> this dlc is brutal on nightmare
[4:24:41] <%chiazam> How long until he tweets about this?
[4:24:42] <boogaleeboo> Because ultimately it's just "Do it"
[4:24:45] <tanarath> Woolie should play on easy
[4:24:55] <%mike2hands> Its me or the brb is faster?
[4:24:56] <boogaleeboo> There's no trick, you go in hard and keep the pressure up to end it as fast as you can
[4:24:58] <%maybefalco> this fight wouldn't be so bad if the laser grid wasn't there and dread knight stomps didn't have an AoE that persists over time
[4:25:03] <%AzureGale> I think the fight could use more Marauders. What do you think?
[4:25:05] <$Gabe36578> has woolie played this yet?
[4:25:08] <akitanito> I can feel the pain through the screen
[4:25:11] <geassguy360> theres no way woolie will be able to play on anything but easy
[4:25:15] <$realm_forge> When Woolie rage will be earth shattering
[4:25:17] <star87if> did the stream just start guys??
[4:25:19] <%Lizard0TM> Woolie's gonna need to play on easy lmao
[4:25:29] <%Lizard0TM> no
[4:25:45] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> we've seen Woolie play halo and cod no amount of easy will help him
[4:25:50] <%Lizard0TM> Woolie has not played the DLC yet
[4:25:53] <%Lizard0TM> probably soon
[4:25:56] <%Lizard0TM> who knows
[4:25:59] <Moondoggie25> pat backpedaling in a straight line with the minigun isnt helping a ton here
[4:26:00] <%Lizard0TM> maybe a year from now
[4:26:02] <tanarath> @star87if Pat's besn at this for a while.
[4:26:06] <%arcielardor> I'm crying with laughter
[4:26:27] <heart_ablaze> woolie will probably play it when all the parts are ou
[4:26:35] <star87if> @tanarath ahhh, okay then ^^
[4:26:59] <%arcielardor> I watched a guy beat this DLC in six hours, three of those hours were on that specific portion of the boss fight.
[4:27:02] <+NitronStreams> !uptime
[4:27:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 27m.
[4:27:06] <+freelancer_960> ur supposed to use glory kills for health, not chainsaw
[4:27:15] <Zebroneath> yeah, no
[4:27:18] <%wruce__billis> just do it
[4:27:24] <%chiazam> You TOTALLY can tho
[4:27:26] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> just have to be not bad
[4:27:30] <BurdRightsActivist> just shoot the enemies pat 4Head
[4:27:31] <heart_ablaze> you can tho
[4:27:32] <%BinaryFireball> but youre a progamr
[4:27:33] <xxshadowxx416> you could just get gud
[4:27:36] <%brachydios777> DLC HARD
[4:27:40] <%BinaryFireball> oh
[4:27:41] <+HostilePoundcakes> @PatStaresAt i recommend to focus on the pain elemental first
[4:27:42] <%dekkitout> *Cracks open can of druggies* "Morivated sbfpPatschwitz "
[4:27:43] <geassguy360> its do-able on easy
[4:27:43] <peachy996> And now back to our regularly scheduled death
[4:27:45] <+ThemDubs> use the microwave gun to stun them
[4:27:46] <%YakumoYomi> Just do it, tho
[4:27:50] <+MayorRev> wanna switch over to 14?
[4:27:53] <%wruce__billis> yeaj man pull a 16b hour shift it's just viedo games
[4:28:02] <M0untain_wolf> Oh hi Pat
[4:28:09] <M0untain_wolf> More Doom!
[4:28:11] <%SirGO0SE> @MayorRev LUL
[4:28:27] <geassguy360> DASH MORE
[4:28:28] <peachy996> Yes (for the billionth time) Microwave Beam will stunlock Possessed Demons but you can't stay there the whole time
[4:28:31] <+LittleBigQuebec> "all that for a drop of blood"
[4:28:31] <+ThemDubs> microwave gun also gives you their health bar
[4:28:40] <%mighty_max_t> Owen Wilson *wow*
[4:28:40] <Tupperwarez> jesus, melted the bones of him and he still kept coming
[4:28:41] <%chiazam> stick and move babyee
[4:28:55] <geassguy360> THIS IS WHY DASH SHOULD NOT BE ON THE FACE BUTTONS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
[4:29:11] <+LittleBigQuebec> MEDIC
[4:29:13] <peachy996> 1 down
[4:29:20] <peachy996> Annnnd ded
[4:29:27] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Kill the round evil first
[4:29:28] <%chiazam> you keep getting ganked by that guy
[4:29:33] <%maenos2> you can do it pat
[4:29:34] <ataxia72> if you just kept flowing through the arena you've have made it
[4:29:37] <fortheboyzs> true
[4:29:42] <JaseAdrift> wow this boss/level design seems incredibly annoying
[4:29:52] <duraju> microwave should kill faster
[4:29:54] <+Trimoon333> my problem was the fact they come BACK
[4:29:59] <%butthurtdave> you slow down when using the microwave right?
[4:30:07] <peachy996> And you just had to go for the Blorb in Round 4
[4:30:14] <M0untain_wolf> This a challenge?
[4:30:18] <%trustycoyote> @butthurtdave Yes. To a crawl
[4:30:20] <Maverick2736> problem with the pain elemental is that he has the biggest stupid health pool out of them, so focusing him lets the others gank you too
[4:30:23] <JaseAdrift> @butthurtdave yes it slows you down
[4:30:26] <peachy996> @butthurtdave Yeah but you can still use grenades and Flame belch
[4:30:31] <geassguy360> you can jump
[4:30:31] <+Trimoon333> gotta dash around while beaming @PatStaresAt
[4:30:38] <%AzureGale> The worst
[4:31:00] <Josef_Stryker> It's a really difficult fight and hopefulyl Part 2 doesn't put so much emphasis on them
[4:31:05] <geassguy360> dash needs to be off the face buttons im telling you
[4:31:09] <+Trimoon333> @PatStaresAt and jump around time slows down while doing it
[4:31:10] <mudamudajo> I'm back. Did I miss anything or is it still just ass explosions?
[4:31:12] <%notgarza> A POSE
[4:31:19] <curse85> does the damage stay from the microwave? i would say do alittle bit do a lap then do alittle more than repeat
[4:31:21] <Tupperwarez> BUSTED
[4:31:21] <+Trimoon333> you got it!
[4:31:28] <%butthurtdave> BIG PROUD BUDDY
[4:31:34] <+NitronStreams> IS THIS THE RUN?
[4:31:39] <ataxia72> get on those platforms dude
[4:31:40] <+LittleBigQuebec> just remind yourself another hellknight is on the loose
[4:31:44] <Moondoggie25> i dont mind them, but ghosts do kinda suck
[4:31:53] <%calivsak> @PatStaresAt since there are no weaknesses switch your rune to the super blood punch
[4:31:58] <+HostilePoundcakes> F
[4:31:58] <+NitronStreams> FUCK
[4:31:58] <+Trimoon333> agh

[4:32:00] <%Dakuu75> aww
[4:32:02] <+freelancer_960> microwave is nice imo cuz it esentially shows the enemy's health bar
[4:32:02] <geassguy360> GOD

[4:37:27] <%calivsak> doomguy VS doom ITSELF
[4:37:28] <+MayorRev> TWO OF THEM
[4:37:28] <penitentpendant> Can't wait for Doom Guy to meat hook Doom Guy into a Blood Punch
[4:37:30] <jellssssss20> Nah but what if you took ONE isstep
[4:37:30] <Josef_Stryker> AND THEN JOHN BECAME A DEMON
[4:37:34] <Jflaskd13> phazon doomguy
[4:37:35] <+Trimoon333> The very begining cut scene's context is very different after seeing this @PatStaresAt
[4:37:36] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Vergil
[4:37:36] <+WackyGear> how are there two doomguys
[4:37:36] <mudamudajo> It looks we were the DOOM Eternal all along.
[4:37:36] <Noogiez> good shit pat
[4:37:39] <%wruce__billis> @PatStaresAt There's a cut line from the main game where a seraph mantions you're from Earth 12 or some shit.
[4:37:39] <JaceDarkstar> thats kinda lame
[4:37:40] <peachy996> I hope they make that Saton fight radical and not like Samur's 5 Rounds of BS
[4:37:41] <Zebroneath> But yeah, those fights were dumb. On Nightmare, GOOD FUCKING LUCK.
[4:37:42] <%ssjklyco> We truly are the Doom Eternal
[4:37:42] <%trustycoyote> Well.... thoughts?
[4:37:43] <DonsCountryStore> I love doom and this story blows goats
[4:37:43] <+NitronStreams> OH SHIT ITS YUG MOOD
[4:37:46] <%notgarza> the D in Doom guy is for Demon
[4:37:49] <+Breaknoon> DG-X
[4:37:52] <+Trimoon333> In my eyes
[4:37:53] <M0untain_wolf> Its Overrrr
[4:37:56] <M0untain_wolf> for now
[4:37:56] <Maverick2736> The Doom Slayer Slayer
[4:37:58] <%MonsterEnvy> I imagine the Dark Lord. is going to be stupidly hard in the next game.
[4:37:59] <mudamudajo> Now... picture that boss fight.
[4:38:06] <+ThemDubs> doom 64
[4:38:12] <%AncelDeLambert> "The planet, my son, or me?" "... yes"
[4:38:16] <%wruce__billis> doom 3
[4:38:18] <+ThemDubs> they planned it in advance
[4:38:18] <geassguy360> Prob talking about the "mark of the beast" line
[4:38:19] <%butthurtdave> Watch the fight be you versus another player
[4:38:23] <%UvBenServed> Part 2 is just gonna be that boss fight
[4:38:28] <jellssssss20> I'm so glad I cuaght that and only that lmao
[4:38:31] <JaceDarkstar> i miss doom 2016
[4:38:32] <+duskrush> mood guy
[4:38:35] <+Pyroclase> DLC 2 boss?
[4:38:37] <DonsCountryStore> I played that bossfight on original doom with my 9600 baud modem
[4:38:37] <%Nomenanza> it's gonna be Dusk all over again.
[4:38:37] <mudamudajo> The Dark Lord will be like fighting a hacker teen in COD
[4:38:38] <+duskrush> MOOD GUY
[4:38:38] <DXLelouch24> VERGIL
[4:38:38] <%Lizard0TM> "I'm you but cooler"
[4:38:38] <epicbiomouse> The only thing they fear is YOU
[4:38:39] <%brachydios777> VERGIL
[4:38:39] <geassguy360> its gonna be like dusk lol
[4:38:40] <CappuccinoGuil> Vergil?
[4:38:40] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @butthurtdave i want that so bad
[4:38:40] <+Breaknoon> ggez
[4:38:42] <%Monkeyweed21> You have to stop the Dark Lord from stealing your glory kills to heal
[4:38:43] <%calivsak> Super duper dark marauder
[4:38:44] <valriot> no hes Vergil
[4:38:47] <%Spydurman> Doom 2016 still best Doom imo
[4:38:48] <%dekkitout> Marauder-er
[4:38:48] <+Trimoon333> @PatStaresAt Sorry I just mean the first scene for Eternal.
[4:38:50] <CappuccinoGuil> IT'S GONNA BE DUSK, OMG
[4:38:52] <%notgarza> 1v1 sword fight
[4:38:53] <CappuccinoGuil> YO
[4:38:56] <DXLelouch24> Woolie got hisVergil
[4:38:58] <necroanatomy> The only thing they fear is you.
[4:38:59] <DonsCountryStore> @Spydurman you're right
[4:39:00] <%Nomenanza> I think they mean the mark of the Slayer
[4:39:03] <%AzureGale> The final boss of the DLC saga will be three Marauders duct-taped together
[4:39:05] <necroanatomy> LIterally
[4:39:05] <geassguy360> Eternal's, the "Mark of the beast" line
[4:39:06] <%cvp5127> @Spydurman agreed
[4:39:07] <CappuccinoGuil> What if it's Dusk? Fight the guy with the same weapon set as you???
[4:39:08] <%mighty_max_t> Man, what if the Evil Doomguy can pick up the ammo and health in the level
[4:39:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Imagine a Marauder that can heal with glory kills @PatStaresAt
[4:39:18] <%DianaTheAscian> can't wait for Woolie to play this in 1 year
[4:39:21] <+Trimoon333> @PatStaresAt It shows the symbol on his back. "We send only you" it's not god talking there
[4:39:23] <CoronaVirusIsOver> technically doomguy is earth's version of davoth since he's a decillion years old
[4:39:24] <HollowDragon231> THE MARK OF THE BEAST
[4:39:32] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Fighting The dark lord is going to be like fight that one boss from Dusk
[4:39:33] <%YakumoYomi> The boss fight is just going to be a "Spear of the Church" fight: the Dark Lord in your game is just another player
[4:39:35] <penitentpendant> Evil Doomguy Glory Killing you
[4:39:37] <%wruce__billis> YOU MISSED THREE
[4:39:38] <DonsCountryStore> They always say they only fear you like it's a big meme but there's never a moment where they show fear like the halo grunts
[4:39:42] <HollowDragon231> THE MARK OF THE BEAST REFERENCES DARK LORD
[4:39:42] <CptJeezus> final boss will be 4 marauders connected by sticks like Michael Jackson puppets
[4:39:43] <+Pyroclase> wow, look at all that XP
[4:39:44] <%butthurtdave> You got stuff
[4:39:45] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> Marty stratton has lost his mind
[4:39:51] <%AzureGale> What if they let you BECOME a Marauder
[4:39:56] <Maverick2736> final boss of this DLC saga will just be Quake Arena
[4:39:56] <Zebroneath> Pat suffered, so Woolie wouldn't have to.
[4:39:57] <Teregulus> Yeah it's King Novik saying that.
[4:40:00] <%SaiyanShoto> You’re a big strong man Pat
[4:40:00] <%Nomenanza> bitterPalm
[4:40:02] <%cvp5127> get you bethesda points
[4:40:02] <theredfox930000> nice job pat
[4:40:03] <peachy996> Isn't that voice the Sentinel King though?
[4:40:04] <Teregulus> I think it even says it in the subtitle.
[4:40:05] <%trustycoyote> Makes a good point
[4:40:05] <mudamudajo> The guy talking is king Novak right?
[4:40:09] <%butthurtdave> sure nuff
[4:40:09] <%Nomenanza> people being proven wrong in 3... 2... 1....
[4:40:10] <valriot> No, the voice over is King Novik???
[4:40:11] <geassguy360> yeah theres a reason people call that DLC plutonia hard
[4:40:12] <peachy996> Yeah it's King Novik
[4:40:12] <+MayorRev> "YOU GOT STUFF"
[4:40:19] <+ThemDubs> it is
[4:40:22] <tanarath> Good job, Pat.
[4:40:27] <%DianaTheAscian> oh yeah that is the mark on his back
[4:40:30] <%Monkeyweed21> why is he mentioning mankind's sins?
[4:40:40] <HollowDragon231> Mark of the Beast references the dark lord
[4:40:42] <DonsCountryStore> this story sucks now I'm telling you
[4:40:44] <peachy996> ??
[4:40:46] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Look at the sick Makyr skin you get
[4:40:47] <%Nomenanza> @Monkeyweed21 because it is cool
[4:40:47] <+Pyroclase> doom vergil has a pentagram on his back
[4:40:48] <%butthurtdave> Pat how sweaty are you right now
[4:40:52] <peachy996> That was a ball sweatener
[4:40:52] <Tupperwarez> G fuckin G pat, dang
[4:40:53] <%AzureGale> Pat Stares At He's On Fire
[4:40:53] <+ThemDubs> PAT yourself on the back
[4:40:58] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Part 2 is going to be rough huh
[4:40:58] <+Pyroclase> you unlock some really cool skins for beating the DLC by the way
[4:41:00] <bisexualsolidsnake> watch out, pat
[4:41:00] <Saltmeisterr> yay dlc over
[4:41:00] <HollowDragon231> man of sweat
[4:41:02] <%DianaTheAscian> U. DID. IT.
[4:41:03] <%Spydurman> that couch is soaked
[4:41:08] <Saltmeisterr> time for the real shit
[4:41:10] <necroanatomy> I feel like that fight would've been fine if it cut down on like one phase.
[4:41:12] <Saltmeisterr> DISC ROOM
[4:41:12] <+MayorRev> I cant WAIT to see civvie review this
[4:41:13] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> So did you like it? I thought it was great
[4:41:14] <$realm_forge> PAT LOOK OUT
[4:41:16] <theredfox930000> now it's time to play sonic adventure 2
[4:41:17] <peachy996> Hey and you did it before 2am
[4:41:20] <%IncredibleMeh> @DonsCountryStore yeah honestly this evil doomguy shit is pretty lame
[4:41:24] <%ssjklyco> Elmo looks like a rug
[4:41:24] <Josef_Stryker> So is the Dark Lord the mysterious voice that shouts NOOOO when the Khan Makyr dies?
[4:41:25] <ulcaban> Does Other Doomguy also have a rabbit?
[4:41:28] <bisexualsolidsnake> be careful
[4:41:31] <duraju> did you watch out, pat?
[4:41:33] <peachy996> Now do Nightmare quick
[4:41:37] <+NitronStreams> Im looking forward to fighting Yug Mood
[4:41:38] <DonsCountryStore> The most interesting aspects like Sam being a human are handwaved away as "clone, don't worry about it"
[4:41:39] <%Monkeyweed21> I hope the Dark Lord does a glory kill on you
[4:41:39] <+Cobaltor_252> you look like you just finished DOOM
[4:41:44] <bisexualsolidsnake> the baby!!!
[4:41:44] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> long boi
[4:41:47] <%AzureGale> long cat is looooooooooooong
[4:41:51] <JaceDarkstar> you look as fresh and as nubile as the day you started youtube... which isnt saying much
[4:41:52] <%wruce__billis> The other Doomguy's rabbit is all of Hell
[4:41:52] <%DakotaMacDoodle> That dark lord fight better sick
[4:41:52] <%trustycoyote> Elmo has dem dancer legs
[4:41:54] <+MayorRev> Play 14, lets have a chill stream
[4:41:55] <%mighty_max_t> Em-long
[4:41:55] <%maenos2> @ulcaban I'm gonna say ferrer
[4:41:57] <%brachydios777> @josef_stryker Vega/Father
[4:41:59] <%maenos2> ferret
[4:42:01] <%NopeBadguy> i just tried to do the same with my cat and she bit the shit out of me ;_;
[4:42:01] <duraju> he's only long cuz pat is short
[4:42:04] <+Breaknoon> long cat died ;_;
[4:42:05] <%Ner234> OLD cat
[4:42:09] <%linSP> what is that white rug
[4:42:10] <bisexualsolidsnake> what're you doing for his birthday?!
[4:42:11] <VirtuaRailith> I love elmo
[4:42:14] <illtima> Pat, how do you deal with your cat allergies?
[4:42:16] <%DianaTheAscian> how old will Elmo be?
[4:42:21] <%Monkeyweed21> DEMON BUNNY FIGHT THO
[4:42:21] <Maverick2736> I like the Dark Lord, though. I've been thinking "imagine if hell had their own Doomguy to fight the Doomguy" since Doom 2016
[4:42:27] <xxshadowxx416> clone emlo
[4:42:31] <DonsCountryStore> like why does Doomguy save Vega but smash the Father's sphere, he's stupid and inconsistent
[4:42:31] <%optimasmaximas> night guys im headin out
[4:42:32] <%NopeBadguy> I simply live with the pain. - Pat 2020
[4:42:41] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> kiss the baby
[4:42:45] <%Monkeyweed21> I want to see the demon version of Daisy
[4:42:47] <$realm_forge> @illtima lots and lots of delicious drugs
[4:42:51] <bisexualsolidsnake> the ultimate sacrifices for the baby
[4:42:54] <%SaiyanShoto> Elmo is worth the allergies
[4:43:17] <%wruce__billis> @PatStaresAt Because at that point he knows that Father is going to be manipulated by Samur
[4:43:17] <%UvBenServed> Cuz fuck Sam I guess
[4:43:19] <+ThemDubs> seraphim wanted it for selfish purposes
[4:43:19] <%trustycoyote> Yeah all he had to do was just not give it to Sam
[4:43:19] <OverlordedK> yeah I still don't really get why he crushed the sphere
[4:43:23] <%Monkeyweed21> no gods or demons, only DOOM
[4:43:24] <heart_ablaze> THANK YOU
[4:43:24] <+Trimoon333> I'm assuming he doesn't want any gods
[4:43:27] <+LandOfTheWay> cause Father wouldn't let him kill the Dark Lord
[4:43:28] <curse85> i thought hells doom guy was the marauders
[4:43:28] <peachy996> My only guess is he was expecting Sam to betray him once he had it
[4:43:28] <DonsCountryStore> it just seems like contrivances towards a half baked plot rushed to market because who cares
[4:43:30] <+NitronStreams> it seemed like it was just to spite sam
[4:43:31] <HollowDragon231> because Samir could've got to heaven before him
[4:43:33] <peachy996> Sam was practically drooling
[4:43:35] <%IncredibleMeh> Doomguy pulled a massive Kratos and fucked up everything
[4:43:36] <bisexualsolidsnake> how old is Elmo
[4:43:38] <+Cobaltor_252> ya I can't really make sense of some of Doomguy's choices here
[4:43:40] <+ThemDubs> the spirits
[4:43:42] <$realm_forge> So evil doom guy has no chance of absorbing the father’s power
[4:43:43] <geassguy360> the father would have stopped him from killing davoth, and davoth would have absorbed it if he was rezed but not the father
[4:43:49] <%brachydios777> The Father will stop him from killing the Dark Lord cause he still loves his son
[4:43:51] <theanora1> Hey Pat, you and Paige doing better?
[4:43:55] <+freelancer_960> unsure of sam's motives
[4:43:55] <%wruce__billis> YES
[4:43:56] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah...
[4:43:58] <Saltmeisterr> I mean
[4:44:03] <%wruce__billis> That bothered me so much
[4:44:04] <necroanatomy> I agree
[4:44:04] <%Spydurman> ya
[4:44:05] <%Dakuu75> hasn't there always been?
[4:44:06] <tattleworm> eternal made him duke nukem
[4:44:08] <DonsCountryStore> I liked angry doom man from 2016
[4:44:08] <+sweetvillain> hmm good point
[4:44:09] <+Trimoon333> man too angry to die
[4:44:09] <%cvp5127> theres too much plot
[4:44:09] <heart_ablaze> yeah
[4:44:09] <+Pyroclase> I'll be honest, I completely stopped caring about the story in this DLC...
[4:44:10] <Chatterbox1991> me too
[4:44:11] <Saltmeisterr> that was like that base game part
[4:44:12] <%trustycoyote> Yeah.... I feel that
[4:44:14] <HollowDragon231> He earned the chosen one status
[4:44:15] <+Helmed> the worst part of the new doomguy is the whole god chosen stuff, he was much better just being ANGRY SOLDIER
[4:44:16] <JaceDarkstar> doom guy is cooler if hes just a guy
[4:44:17] <DonsCountryStore> not He-Doom Man
[4:44:19] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> if he were the chosen one he would have saved the father
[4:44:21] <Zebroneath> I agree. I always saw him as really angry man who had his pet bunny killed
[4:44:21] <%NopeBadguy> The core idea of Doomguy is that he's just you and that removes that.
[4:44:22] <%shadowace2400> yeah...
[4:44:22] <%DianaTheAscian> I liked it when he was just fucking pissed
[4:44:23] <%AzureGale> Just a guy who wants to kill stuff
[4:44:24] <%Spydurman> In Doom 2016 when he was legend through deeds not Angel chosen god given gifts
[4:44:26] <HollowDragon231> he didn't start as one he earned it
[4:44:26] <Jflaskd13> doomguy was a regular dood till eventually, people started giving him powers and accolades
[4:44:30] <bruuzer12> hes a guy, but you want a dude
[4:44:30] <necroanatomy> This is why Dusk dude is nice. He's a treasure hunter that just wandered into some shit.
[4:44:30] <VirtuaRailith> I liked it better when he was just really pissed off
[4:44:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Do we know if he looked the same before getting the god juice machine? @PatStaresAt
[4:44:33] <ulcaban> 'Imma Doome'
[4:44:34] <peachy996> You prefer him to be normal that became special not he was always special
[4:44:36] <%maenos2> I'm a doom man, from my doom clan, doing my doom plan
[4:44:37] <+freelancer_960> they literally give him god powers...
[4:44:38] <valriot> I dont think thats what he is, Hell ust needs a ruler, and the only one who can IS Doomguy
[4:44:38] <%notgarza> Good stream, tho
[4:44:40] <necroanatomy> It's always better when it's a dude that wanders into some shit and becomes badass
[4:44:40] <%chiazam> 2-6 sounds normal for you
[4:44:41] <JaceDarkstar> always
[4:44:43] <%weissguard> Thanks for stream.
[4:44:44] <theredfox930000> there was something very earnest about doom 2016
[4:44:45] <bisexualsolidsnake> watch out, pat
[4:44:50] <Zebroneath> I really hope Daisy comes back
[4:44:58] <mudamudajo> There is a prophecy in 2016, but it's says Dark Lord is gonna make Doomguy cry.
[4:45:07] <Moondoggie25> stop making milkshakes if you dont want boys in your yard pat
[4:45:10] <Jflaskd13> he already killed the icon of sin once as a regular guy
[4:45:12] <+Trimoon333> I just don't like how there's two
[4:45:21] <%wruce__billis> Tje problem is that Doom 2016 satirizes the very concept of plot in a video game, while Eternal buys into itself

[4:45:52] <Maverick2736> Yeah, Doomguys didn't start as a chosen one. That chosen stuff started happening in-between Doom 2 and Doom 2016 when the maykrs gave him a bunch of powers and shit
[4:45:52] <JaceDarkstar> when i saw that ammo drops in eternal were skittles i kinda lost hope that i was gonna enjoy it
[4:45:53] <%YakumoYomi> Will you charge me?

[4:46:27] <%Monkeyweed21> yea leaving the Father sphere means either Sam or Doom Lord can become God
[4:46:31] <+NitronStreams> This guy is fuckinc UNBELIEVABLE
[4:46:36] <%notgarza> i was hoping for the intern to be satan
[4:46:42] <+Cobaltor_252> @PatStaresAt so is DOOM Eternal just Doomguy battling HIS demons?
[4:46:44] <SjoeB89> Why are you still up at this time?
[4:46:52] <ulcaban> @NitronStreams Deep cut!
[4:46:53] <geassguy360> each universe has its primeval to protect it, davoth was the one for jekkad, which eventually became hell
[4:46:55] <bisexualsolidsnake> final boss is jeff bezos
[4:46:58] <%stubborndeer> pat order a pizza for your dog

[4:48:17] <@SoFarFetched> just cover it in mustard
[4:48:22] <%SaiyanShoto> One the other hand cake and cookies anytime you want?
[4:48:23] <+LandOfTheWay> considering you basically get to dogfight arsenal gear in the ac7 dlc, i'd say so
[4:48:24] <%wruce__billis> Demon's Souls look inaesthetic compared to the OG but I'll still play and probably love it
[4:48:27] <%AzureGale> CAT
[4:48:36] <%Arweynn> paige was already broken though
[4:48:39] <curse85> anybody hyped for dmc 5 se?
[4:49:04] <%trustycoyote> @curse85 Yes and bummed that i can't play it...
[4:49:04] <%LVDoomien> LVDoomien subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Hi Pat thanks for the discord everyone in there is very nice and cool
[4:49:07] <+Helmed> curse85 when it comes out for pc
[4:49:16] <+Mugen4552> Get Paige, Elmo and Zang painted on the PS5 face plate
[4:49:17] <%Ner234> @wruce__billis "Inaesthetic" ? What does that even mean?
[4:49:40] <@SoFarFetched> its fine ,we love dog
[4:49:47] <@SoFarFetched> More than Pat
[4:49:52] <@SoFarFetched> but ESPECIALLY Elmo
[4:49:56] <%weissguard> Terrible Twos
[4:50:00] <%weissguard> Gotta love em
[4:50:07] <curse85> i heard pc is only getting vergil not the other features so thats kinda lame
[4:50:08] <+Helmed> Ner234 it doesnt have the same gothic theme anymore. acording to the developers it was a "hard decision" to change the castle scenery to be more inline with the other souls castles look
[4:50:13] <%AzureGale> lol
[4:50:14] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[4:50:15] <%trustycoyote> GD Beatles are rotting his brain

[4:50:52] <+Dova573> you dint know?
[4:50:54] <%trustycoyote> @curse85 Correct and Yes it is very lame
[4:50:55] <%LVDoomien> yeah but the music I like is good noise and the music You like is bad noise
[4:50:58] <%LVDoomien> that's how that works right
[4:50:59] <+Dova573> patrick
[4:51:05] <+Mugen4552> Like a Dragon is this Tuesday
[4:51:05] <%DianaTheAscian> it still feels weeks away
[4:51:08] <%wruce__billis> @Ner234 IN addition to the catsles no longer being gothic, changes in lighting means that there isn't a stark light/dark contrast as in the original
[4:51:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> koozies!
[4:51:19] <%NopeBadguy> Dub or sub for Y7?
[4:51:21] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's gonna be juggling everything
[4:51:22] <%BudaBryan> BudaBryan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[4:51:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> buttsnacks?
[4:51:29] <%LVDoomien> It's still weird to me that PS5 is right around the corner

[4:52:22] <SonicD4> it gave the stream a certain.... flavor
[4:52:24] <AFlyingTaco1> Are you getting a Ekbek next week, Pat? Or just the PS5?
[4:52:24] <Profmcstevie> You know what Paige would have said about that boss fight? "Just Do"
[4:52:26] <%Monkeyweed21> No Demons, you are the John @PatStaresAt
[4:52:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I like her saying something dumb and laughing her butt off
[4:52:30] <%NovaKnightmare> I miss the mustard queen

[4:52:56] <coladscorpion> Hey pat. First time watching. Youre just as crazy as i imagined. What happened to paige??
[4:52:58] <%saadi90> I’m so excited! Best Buy has me set up an appointment for launch day. Picking my Ps5 up at 6:30
[4:53:00] <peachy996> Same
[4:53:00] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt Does she understand what bits are yet?
[4:53:05] <%AzureGale> I think I got to watch ONE show before school
[4:53:08] <coladscorpion> !donate
[4:53:09] <Moondoggie25> same
[4:53:10] <%DianaTheAscian> no
[4:53:16] <peachy996> Take every minute before you march off to your shitty job
[4:53:21] <primarch_lupercal> well theres always travel time
[4:53:34] <%LVDoomien> Paige is in the hospital due to the bad back but she's okay otherwise
[4:53:40] <peachy996> eh
[4:53:47] <%DianaTheAscian> eh
[4:53:47] <peachy996> I don't care it's Doom
[4:53:54] <Profmcstevie> He is no longer one of us, he is a "chosen one"
[4:53:56] <peachy996> It's MK level story
[4:53:56] <Moondoggie25> ahh yes, the doom story
[4:54:01] <peachy996> Stupid
[4:54:12] <%DianaTheAscian> it really could matter less to me
[4:54:13] <$realm_forge> Who the fuck plays doom for the story tho?
[4:54:32] <Maverick2736> I don't think it's *that* bad, some people are taking it way too seriously
[4:54:41] <peachy996> You know what it's like? It's like playing an FPS with the Mass Effect 2 Wheel
[4:54:42] <%DakotaMacDoodle> eh its doom the game just needs to play well the story is just a bonus for fun
[4:54:49] <%Dakuu75> I mean... the story ain't "bad" but, it's not the #1 reason to play lol
[4:54:50] <%LVDoomien> still haven't taken the plastic off my copy of Doom Eternal
[4:54:50] <osaka_daioh> veey DmC like
[4:54:50] <ulcaban> Those bloody wall guys
[4:54:52] <+paladinstarbuster> I think its that he was just some guy but hopped universes and became a dude instead of a guy
[4:54:56] <%trustycoyote> @peachy996 Story in a video game is like a story in a porn: you expect it to be there but it really doesn't matter - John Carmack... rough quotation
[4:55:02] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[4:55:05] <+Dova573> Was hoping for new weapons in the dlcs
[4:55:08] <Moondoggie25> ghosts are a step too far
[4:55:11] <%mighty_max_t> Oh, I didn't know people felt that way about the base game. I just noticed it with the DLC
[4:55:14] <%Monkeyweed21> If you've played on Nightmare you realize you don't have time to always do the weapon specific stuff @PatStaresAt
[4:55:15] <+Cobaltor_252> sounds like a DmC-type problem
[4:55:19] <+Dova573> or at least getting the old gauss cannon back
[4:55:22] <%Nomenanza> The DLC is new, people are still figuring shit out.
[4:55:22] <Saltmeisterr> compare cacos in 2016 to cacos in Eternal
[4:55:27] <%cvp5127> i liked 2016 better
[4:55:30] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah do it
[4:55:31] <%Spydurman> Doom 2016 10/10. Doom Eternal 8/10
[4:55:31] <coladscorpion> What about the key?
[4:55:31] <peachy996> Doom 2016 is a simpler game but that's not bad
[4:55:31] <%AzureGale> Do eeeet
[4:55:32] <$RealThiele> man i wanna buy some baifus
[4:55:40] <heart_ablaze> the possession part is cool, the microwave part sucks
[4:55:45] <%DakotaMacDoodle> All doom is good doom all games are doom
[4:55:46] <%Nomenanza> Just recently a dude found a way to one cycle a Marauder with an auto-shotgun mod.
[4:55:47] <%coladscorpion> coladscorpion subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:55:51] <%ssjklyco> We're assholes
[4:55:58] <%Monkeyweed21> focusing on the weapon specific stuff will get you killed on higher difficulties
