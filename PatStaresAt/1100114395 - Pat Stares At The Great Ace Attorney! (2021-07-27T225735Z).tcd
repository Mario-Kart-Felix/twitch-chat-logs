[2:18:19] <%NopeBadguy> TBH, I miss Layton vs Wright
[2:18:23] <%NopeBadguy> That game was really good
[2:18:35] <+bugz_munny> Dude nah lol
[2:18:41] <+bugz_munny> That plot was too much
[2:18:41] <%robosqueeb> it was good except for all that awful Layton stuff
[2:18:43] <Hexidimentional> @MasterTonberry23 making a visit to elmo's birthplace apparently
[2:18:45] <%NopeBadguy> It had really easy puzzles for a Layton game tho
[2:18:55] <%polothegreatest> never played LVSP. the rest yes

[2:19:22] <+bugz_munny> With like 5 witnesses
[2:19:28] <%robosqueeb> I respectfully disagree but can see how fans of Layton would like it tho
[2:19:28] <%polothegreatest> including the fan traslations of miles 1&2
[2:19:32] <cardamomo88> i want another layton game u_u

[2:19:49] <%RealThiele> didnt level 5 die?
[2:19:50] <%NopeBadguy> @bugz_munny It's back in this game. Layton vs Wright heavily influenced this game's development since Takumi was on both instead of the main series.
[2:20:05] <%NopeBadguy> Level 5 stopped NA operations, IIRC?
[2:20:06] <%RyTYoung> After 120+ hours, I have platinumed Death Stranding doodNuts

[3:33:31] <%pipboy344> @patstaresat I was watching the old Last of Us playthrough and remembered what your favorite part of zombie fiction is. The original Dawn of the Dead like that, the first act is all about a tv station bringing on special guests and everyone arguing & shit and a SWAT team & the National Guard raiding an apartment complex where people are stashing their infected families. Everything up to the end of act 2 is the last days when it turns from something easily contained to the apocalypse

[3:36:03] <$Faustgesicht> Wait, but then the meat gets poisoned....
[3:36:04] <xeros720> the book i read mentioned them using it to hunt monkeys; it's a neurotoxin; they just fall from the branches and they pick them up
[3:36:07] <Sulfur_Boride> @OneThousandTomatoes This case is in Japan
[3:36:08] <romc215> The Amazon is a dungeon when you think about it. It has poisonous snakes, giant spiders and large hostile beasts

[3:36:13] <Vcom7418> I think I'll read all Payne's lines in Pat's vocie from now on lmao

[3:36:18] <hassanico2> @OneThousandTomatoes this is an oldschool Japanese outfit
[3:36:20] <xeros720> you cook it and it didn't seem to be a problem

[3:37:06] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Or your heart
[3:37:06] <dinnydanny777> Yeah that sounds horrible
[3:37:13] <akitanito> it would really suck if he still feels that burn
[3:37:14] <PartyFavors> @king_wragles Since he's apparently totally used to it, it's also possible it might be some sorta chronic illness that's not fatal but fucks with his lungs
[3:37:15] <totallykaiserknuckle> poor wilson, dying under the effects of paralysis AND THEN he's shot NotLikeThis WutFace
[3:37:18] <cardamomo88> oof

[3:38:04] <%TheGreatSkenardo> In Japanese Culture, this is regarded as a dick move
[3:38:05] <Sulfur_Boride> Man had to sit there for ten minutes struggling to breathe AND getting burned thoroughly

[3:41:15] <+ScrapKingKeita> A lot of powdered poisons actually can run through water, but the specific reaction is caused by carbonation passing by it acidifying it

[3:51:45] <TheFramedWarlock> THAT'S SO FUCKING ILLEGAL
[3:51:45] <+HeyBoston> lmfao just let her do that
[3:51:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> The court is allowed to assume that destroyed evidence was extremely incriminating

[3:52:11] <dynamic_funk> this is incredibly illegal
[3:52:11] <%RealThiele> SUCK OUT THE VENOM
[3:52:12] <+kewlmyc> Just tampering with evidence IN FRONT OF THE COURT

[3:52:13] <+RowenCleric> but.. theres like 5 wintesses...
[3:52:15] <+lordericter> just pump her stomach to get the poison
[3:52:18] <%LeiaSkynoober> GATEKEEP GASLIGHT GIRLBOSS
[3:52:18] <marcomatame> That seems illegal but it's old time period and laws were dumber
[3:52:19] <+Maleicus> right next to her
[3:52:20] <%juxtest> Is there still some in the glass she drank out of?
[3:52:21] <Case_Ah_Dia> THE GLASS
[3:52:22] <%Puhff> Um, tampering with evidence is definitely a crime
[3:52:23] <%Zero_Jacks> She.... just proved shes guilty
[3:52:26] <%solracc25> tampering evidence

[3:52:28] <osaka_daioh> WOW REALLY

[3:52:31] <lloyddboy> STOP. SIMPING.
[3:52:32] <+RoByte2> It's a good thing she preserved that glass from the crime scene
[3:52:33] <Jakerham_Lincoln> I realize is Ace Attorney but how is that not a massive admission of guilt
[3:52:35] <$Dreadlord134> This shit is so stupid
[3:52:35] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Holy shit the case just keeps going
[3:52:37] <otakon17> wait it's OUT!?

[3:52:43] <cardamomo88> who shoot him??
[3:52:44] <%CzeekyTV> CzeekyTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! nothing to say except take my money
[3:52:45] <%MrP33Ps> man the 19th century was something else

[3:52:56] <DianaTheAscian> who sits like that?
[3:52:59] <Jaysky> She just destroyed evidence in the courtroom
[3:53:00] <AzureHawk_Streams> Then again, be arrested for tampering with evidence trumps being arrested for murder...
[3:53:00] <%CopperTucker> ACTIVATE CHAIR
[3:53:01] <%GarbageNirvana> BUT THE POLITICKS
[3:53:05] <dinnydanny777> To be fair this is probably an accurate depiction of how laws work differently for people who have wealth, status or power...
[3:53:08] <anAngryHamster> I would honestly love an Ace Attorney trial where this scene actually plays out like it would IRL
[3:53:10] <%Ranryu692> there's barely any blood; his heart wasn't pumping when he died
[3:53:11] <Tempmael> TAKE THAT!
[3:53:16] <+silvery_cricket> Is this just foreign evil?
[3:53:16] <cardamomo88> MAN MEJI JAPAN WAS WILD
[3:53:19] <clloudberry> At this ppoint I assume the swan shot the professor
[3:53:20] <dinnydanny777> woops dropped the evidence by mistake
[3:53:20] <+ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Didn't she just admit her guilt by destroying evidence IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE!
[3:53:25] <%Arweynn> it's a good thing she's WEARING AN ANIMAL to test the broken bottle on right now.
[3:53:25] <otakon17> the steak is the key
[3:53:28] <+RowenCleric> the goose shot him!
[3:53:28] <%hoodedlefty> This feels like enough to accuse her
[3:53:30] <+Maleicus> the swan is the gun
[3:53:31] <%Dakuu75> I wanna see this bitch burn, so hard.
[3:53:34] <+vaderxyz1970> The gun is in the goose!

[4:05:08] <Sain_127> you broke the order a bit LUL
[4:05:09] <+FoolsArcade> I think you gotta click the coin itself after this talk
[4:05:11] <osaka_daioh> Why are you doing this?
[4:05:13] <%Ne1son> Sequence Break
[4:05:13] <%Starotter70> @polothegreatest Since around 2015 I think
[4:05:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> Jesus, imagine reading the court record for this trial like 100 years later. It'd read like a bad satire "THE STEAK IS HIDING A CLUE"
[4:05:13] <%Spydurman> LUL
[4:05:13] <fehraf> too soon pat
[4:05:15] <fuji_n2> you did it before the game asked you too LUL
[4:05:17] <otakon17> They're ACTING for the court
[4:05:20] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You broke the order a bit
[4:05:21] <hassanico2> @polothegreatest 5 or so years
[4:05:23] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> @PatStaresAt you jumped ahead
[4:05:23] <primarch_lupercal> Queen Victoria is malding atm
[4:05:24] <cardamomo88> yeah
[4:05:24] <tusk_act4> LUL
[4:05:24] <%AncelDeLambert> this feels like a bug, wtf
[4:05:25] <%bread_assassin> @MasterTonberry23 Yup, and I made that same exact comment, too.

[4:05:30] <MichaelDood> LUL

[4:05:45] <anAngryHamster> Mother Superior jumped the gun

[4:05:45] <+MisterAvry> who the fuck and why the fuck?
[4:05:46] <%AncelDeLambert> I look down to eat for two seconds, and the game is looped
[4:05:48] <%Dakuu75> too fast and too loose
[4:05:48] <+Fep3> pun works better the second time
[4:05:50] <tusk_act4> Yeah it’s the third time LUL

[4:05:53] <%maskofmichael> Pat to smart
[4:05:53] <osaka_daioh> In normal Act Atttoenry you would have done ie first too.
[4:05:53] <%Deft_Thought> Sequence breaking should just modify the scene
[4:05:53] <AlexDaGr8> "bullion in boullion" sounds good enough that the entire case was written around that pun
[4:05:57] <otakon17> it means it's the WRONG plate
[4:05:59] <dynamic_funk> @realthiele well with Pheonix and Wright, they got close to eloping
[4:06:01] <switchbored505> You jumped the gun
[4:06:02] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> This is a problem with most ace attorney ganes
[4:06:05] <F_manS> Eat your hamburgers Patrick.
[4:06:05] <%lemon_rinds> Deja vu more like buillon

[4:06:28] <Midnight188> the backwards logic of the ace attorney games is always a sight to behold. the loops cases go through its like "how is this logical?"

[4:34:12] <%Lion_kun> DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!?!
[4:34:13] <dynamic_funk> WHY WAS HE EATINGTHEN????
[4:34:14] <DianaTheAscian> BRITISH DEFEATED
[4:34:21] <+gutlesscoward> if i even hear the words 'extraterratorial rights' i'll lose it
[4:34:21] <+chiazam> BUT WHY
[4:34:23] <%Starotter70> HypeSus
[4:34:49] <dynamic_funk> professor dilf
[4:34:50] <+RootVeggie> but the other guys saw her too
[4:34:51] <Parapattern> Why would you do this in a public place?
[4:35:10] <Hellarussian> gun
[4:35:12] <%strakillias> Or you could have played it off like he had a heart attack
[4:35:17] <osaka_daioh> oh
[4:35:18] <%Dakuu75> GUN-USSY
[4:35:18] <%juxtest> Why do anything at all if nobody could ever find out how he died?
[4:35:18] <%baka_sugoi> lewd
[4:35:20] <+kewlmyc> Hot
[4:35:25] <%Spydurman> oh ok, was about to say, she brought 2 guns to a poisoning hahaha
[4:35:26] <AzureHawk_Streams> SHUT UP SIMP
[4:35:29] <%Monkeyweed21> GUSSY
[4:35:30] <%Ranryu692> Ryunosuke was also right that he would find it if he could lift her skirt LUL
[4:35:31] <SquidGelatinous> Gussy
[4:35:31] <%AzureGale> It's a heug skirt tho
[4:35:39] <+vaderxyz1970> ok but why did you kill him is it because he gave you an A- on your final?
[4:35:39] <%baka_sugoi> GUSSY
[4:35:49] <Sonicdy> But why is a [Redacted]
[4:35:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wouldn't the professor's gun not be missing any rounds though?
[4:35:57] <+RowenCleric> her gussy exploded all over the professor
[4:36:00] <%BlackStarAura> And picked it up like a fucking idiot
[4:36:03] <%RonaldMcDownload> Shut up, cop
[4:36:11] <$Dreadlord134> Also couldn’t they check that the gun hadn’t been shot?
[4:36:14] <dynamic_funk> huh? what? huh?
[4:36:22] <+bugz_munny> and then the steak bullshit happened
[4:36:23] <+Fep3> Man, that was complex
[4:36:25] <+RootVeggie> Does she even have eyeballs?
[4:36:26] <%AncelDeLambert> gonna be real: I don't give a fuck about her confession
[4:36:27] <%AzureGale> ................
[4:36:32] <Jakerham_Lincoln> Hang on. No one knew to test for curare until Ryunosuke figured it out. If she had just poisoned the professor and played dumb there wouldn't have been anything linking her to the murder beyond being at it
[4:36:34] <DSD24> She also destroyed evidence
[4:36:34] <%Mr_Pylon> man that cop sure is no disco detective
[4:36:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @Dreadlord134 not in 1860's lol
[4:36:36] <%Lion_kun> 1800s forensics is limited
[4:36:36] <hassanico2> Felony
[4:36:37] <%baka_sugoi> .....
[4:36:38] <fuji_n2> @Dreadlord134 1800 japan, so no i guess
[4:36:38] <MrTurtleThief> .......
[4:36:40] <otakon17> ??\
[4:36:43] <otakon17> misdemeanor?
[4:36:45] <%juxtest> If she hadn't brought attention to the death by shooting him it would just look like he had a heart attack or something. If she'd done nothing it could NEVER be traced back to her even if she was sitting at the table at the time.
[4:36:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> She's only confessing because she thinks she can get aawa with it
[4:36:47] <+MisterAvry> no, this is certainly a felony or two
[4:36:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY
[4:36:50] <SpartanDumpster> wait why'd she do it?
[4:36:50] <Hellarussian> why

[4:40:51] <%HotSauceFiend> is phoenix wright japanese?
[4:40:51] <romc215> There was a faster way to determine whether or not Ryu killed Wilson: Check the revolver in his hand. If any shots had been fired from it, it would have had an empty chamber and there would have been powder burns on Ryu's hand. Since there would have been no bullets missing and no burns on his hand, there's no way he could have fired the killing shot, thus clearing him of any suspicion
[4:40:52] <+Fep3> good lord

[4:41:13] <%RealThiele> i mean imprisoning a gaijin to them would be the preferable outcome
[4:41:14] <wolfen091> we could have skipped 4 hours of this if we just used the fact that multiple people for the prosecution were lying and therefore were unreliable witnesses
