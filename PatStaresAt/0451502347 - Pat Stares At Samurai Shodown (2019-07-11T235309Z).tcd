[0:16:47] <ShichiNoBushi> Remember that the creators of SamSho turned down their Epic Games exclusivity deal, so it's available on all PC distribution platforms. So everyone needs to buy it on Steam or whatever so they can get their 1 million copies sold.

[0:24:59] <Prism_Wing> @odiemikes much appreciated. I just can't resist a bad joke. They are refrigerated leftovers.
[0:25:01] <+ClaireBearz> tanking is piss easy now in ffxiv though. It takes almost no effort anymore.

[0:25:03] <$cureneckbeard> dance strem when

[0:25:15] <@absolute_weapon> Interesting, I'll keep thta in mind
[0:25:21] <+Edrem> I like to create tankxiety by barely healing until their nearly dead
[0:25:24] <%Hammerknife> tank anxiety goes away once you realize the idiots you're raiding with don't have any other options for tanks
[0:25:35] <haveswordmuststing> best way to stop tank anxiety is to pick a tank from the begining

[0:26:18] <VRNK> anthem but pokemon when
[0:26:23] <dekkitout> Tem Tem tho
[0:26:28] <+SuperPixelRush> getting?
[0:26:30] <Prevot> it's not
[0:26:35] <Prevot> it's getting less popular
[0:26:36] <%FrostMass22> Part of the appeal is the massive catalogue of pokemon
[0:26:37] <$SleepyMaribo> digimon has a huge cult following
[0:26:44] <+LtShuckle> pokemon might be the biggest franchise on the planet
[0:26:45] <countgaculatv> A strong TCG scene
[0:26:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> DABS
[0:26:50] <bomi1995> its has a 20+ year head start
[0:26:50] <%Ranryu692> didn't yokai watch get cancelled?
[0:26:52] <%odiemikes> apatCrazyhead nobody cares about yokai
[0:26:52] <+DingusMcFadden> Will Emlo ever cosplay as one of the Yokai Watch cats?

[0:26:55] <%FrostMass22> There are so many pokemon that everyone will have one they love
[0:26:55] <$starotter70> Not even one
[0:26:56] <worldbrand> i have no love for old disney cartoons but i like me a pikachu
[0:27:00] <GrimmSquirrelGaming> the game is simple to get into but infinatly complex
[0:27:00] <+gunslinger_xxiv> Digimon have guns
[0:27:02] <dukenux> Mickachu
[0:27:03] <countgaculatv> It's like Dragon Ball, it transcended anime
[0:27:05] <ShichiNoBushi> Dress Elmo like a pikachu.
[0:27:07] <+DesertOfSand> My sample size is 1, but my niece more readily recognizes Pikachu than Mickey
[0:27:10] <%Remery_> Pikachu is a slut
[0:27:11] <%ProtagonistJake> Yokai got too many games in a short span of time so it’s getting slightly less popular
[0:27:16] <Youwereeatenbyalid> pikachu probably more powerful than mickey
[0:27:16] <%Solidnick18> Hello sir apatDab
[0:27:17] <+LtShuckle> mechagodzilla is now a pokemon

[0:27:17] <thegreenbenis> HEY PAPA PATRICK
[0:27:17] <DracaenaLeaf> Yokai Watch 4 looks interesting, Persona/SMT and their personas/demons, and Digimon took off with Cyber Seluth

[0:59:50] <Tekaii00> OMG
[0:59:51] <TurtleButter> oh, so it is a throw.
[0:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:52] <hyrulewarrior84> @hntronium She’s colorblind
[0:59:54] <%fermentthegarbage> apatDab apatPorgmo
[0:59:56] <%ElenaManetta> I'm guessing Charolette is a popular character
[0:59:59] <+Bad1uck> @masterdecoder does that make him the "big bad '?
[1:00:00] <%GohanEgret> oh man this guy is ALSO streaming
[1:00:01] <CalderGaming> now you can't use it for the rest of the match
[1:00:01] <thegreenbenis> GG NO RE
[1:00:05] <%odiemikes> optimum hydration
[1:00:09] <%ElenaManetta> Charlotte, even
[1:00:09] <hntronium> thats a big chicken
[1:00:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @ElenaManetta she certainly looks fun
[1:00:18] <thegreenbenis> Turkey leg
[1:00:22] <Rygart121> AssQuake
[1:00:22] <Saltmeisterr> why does earthquake have ass chicken?
[1:00:27] <%ElenaManetta> She looks like she has moves people would love to spam
[1:00:27] <%foreverN2dust> where did he get the chicken from?
[1:00:28] <ElectricFoxLex> @caldergaming Wrong mechanic
[1:00:34] <bear_breaker20> can anyone vouch for the Switch version? and is any crossplay?
[1:00:36] <%tearknack> tearknack subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! im mmoing pat, its your fault. also, shoutout to digimon cybersleuth for switch; friendship ended with pokemon
[1:00:40] <thegreenbenis> @Saltmeisterr It's ass turkey.
[1:00:45] <RupanSen> @ElenaManetta not as popular as EarthQuake
[1:00:45] <%AncelDeLambert> this is on Switch?
[1:00:46] <TurtleButter> LUL

[1:01:06] <Jack_DT> Charlotte can get it
[1:01:08] <+Bad1uck> right into her trap
[1:01:09] <jinking79> could have got her on the jump
[1:01:10] <thegreenbenis> OH HO HO

[1:01:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Like ghost blowjob range
[1:01:33] <jinking79> less range than an NR game
[1:01:34] <%ElenaManetta> Smash has some short grab distances, doesn't it?
[1:01:39] <+DesertOfSand> Short range and hella recovery, but very fast and can't be teched
[1:01:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Huh. Too bad I've got no reason to buy the Nintendo Online subscription
[1:01:49] <TyrantBelial> It's more that Earthquake doesn't have extended range comapred to others.

[1:15:36] <+greenmoose11915> @Fujiwara_92 wooly is still decently known in the fighting community
[1:15:40] <JayEarly> @twerknadooo VERY high, BIG numbers
[1:15:43] <%odiemikes> you guys remember all the terrorism you commit in FF7? eco terrorism sure but your still bombing things
[1:15:44] <Dragon_Batman> Some characters yes
[1:15:44] <+OkamiDude15> @Twerknadooo if you play your cards right you can win a match game in 2 moves
[1:15:45] <+SaltySombrero> guaranteed depending on who you use.
[1:15:47] <dweebenheimer20> For genjuro yeah
[1:15:51] <TigerFlavoredCereal> HARD SLASH
[1:15:53] <%odiemikes> you're*
[1:15:53] <Nekros4442> Yeah, it's guarenteed on most characters. Like Charlotte needs to walk forward a tiny bit to disarm after throw iirc
[1:15:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat will go lower than 3000 LUL
[1:15:54] <%Dr00_PhD> that damage
[1:16:00] <danknugglit> Darli beat your ass after a throw tho?
[1:16:03] <+SaltySombrero> Genjuro isn't guiaranteed unless you move a little after the throw, that takes practice
[1:16:13] <Dragon_Batman> Fucking Genjuro can cancel after his kicks
[1:16:18] <optosi> that is guaranteed after a parry
[1:16:24] <+TotesBurger> I think only lights and mediums are guaranteed after throws
[1:16:27] <+Dreday543> Your both wrong, cuz Onmiyoji are where its at
[1:16:31] <haveswordmuststing> back throw has more stagger i think
[1:16:38] <+Estuko> ゴゴゴuゴゴゴゴ
[1:16:38] <Hydrapissed> this guy is clowning u
[1:16:40] <%FrustratedAF> 10/10 great job
[1:16:44] <%yoshkosh20> fgod damn. he got the spacing.
[1:16:44] <$starotter70> That's a comeback
[1:16:45] <tigerfang86> STYLED ON
[1:16:49] <CalderGaming> with some characters Weapon Flipping is not guaranteed. Darli needs to have them in the corner, yashamaru and ukyo just don't get it
[1:16:50] <President_valentine> Weapon pick ups are punishable pat
[1:16:51] <+kraajkase> get recked
[1:16:51] <%Solidnick18> Goddamn

[1:35:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Dreday543 Was trying to find the channel. But it's highly doubtful it's all an act. There was one where he yells at a convenience store employee, saying he should be grateful for working in America, coming from a third world country.

[1:42:01] <+greenmoose11915> does this game have a perfect guard system? or is it just plain blocking?
[1:42:09] <%castarts> @HonestHero its nuts
[1:42:09] <Zombrocom> It does
[1:42:12] <%foreverN2dust> @absolute_weapon his fingers are too greasy to grab from the turkey
[1:42:16] <%FrustratedAF> grab into WF is quite common it seems
[1:42:19] <CalderGaming> @greenmoose11915 perfect guard/just defends are in there
[1:42:19] <KruxisV> you have to hold back the entire time
[1:42:19] <ItsAGundamu> gave you a chance

[1:43:17] <Nillard> Kaiser immedately rethinks his support
[1:43:18] <%TheStarbecue> going easy on someone is the opposite of respect
[1:43:22] <+greenmoose11915> the goal is to win. at any cost. if your opponent loses their weapon. keep it from them. giving it back freely is not honorable it is foolish
[1:43:23] <Load_Complete> To be fair @SaltySombrero That's his job
[1:43:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @KaiserSNK don't worry, we'll bug him later
[1:43:28] <+SolverCODO> A shinobi would know the difference between honor and victory
[1:43:30] <dekkitout> Can't there be honorable thuggery
[1:43:34] <Buttku> not enough fireballs
[1:43:34] <+SaltySombrero> @KaiserSNK you do, and i applaud that while also worryiing about your sleep schedule, haha

[1:44:42] <%cherubs_anonymous> Because he's playing Genjuo
[1:44:42] <Zombrocom> Supers are amazing, you just have to know when to use them
[1:44:43] <Fujiwara_92> BIG GENJURO HONOR
[1:44:45] <HonestHero> @saltmeisterr Supers are for HARD reads obly

[1:45:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestPat SNK Community Manager in chat. Put your dick away
[1:45:06] <%castarts> he really just said that
[1:45:06] <KruxisV> WFTs have different startups
[1:45:07] <danknugglit> Awooga
[1:45:09] <+SaltySombrero> That being said, it's a big risk

[1:47:26] <CalderGaming> @AngriestPat also jubei is one of the few characters who needs the extra stun from BACKWARDS throw to combo into WFT
[1:47:29] <+SolverCODO> Except that ONE throw
[1:47:38] <%FrustratedAF> i'm telling you man, throw into weapon flip
[1:47:39] <%tearknack> i wanna teach an animal how to play fighting games

[1:47:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @kaisersnknany advice for our struggling star?
[1:47:47] <+solzan2000> pat your weapons
[1:47:54] <jinking79> well that game
[1:47:55] <auspiciousdgg> Don't feel bad Pat. You're probably playing against nerds who have been playing SamSho V for 15 years.
[1:47:56] <+SolverCODO> yeyeye
[1:47:57] <%FrustratedAF> @tearknack have you heard of roosters?
[1:47:57] <CalderGaming> back throw only
[1:47:59] <%tearknack> orangutan footsies
[1:48:00] <+SolverCODO> nonono
[1:48:01] <TurtleButter> so close
[1:48:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @tearknack Max's dog can. Yet another point for Max over Pat
[1:48:02] <+lucaflow> Pat he was letting you get your weapons back lol
[1:48:07] <+solzan2000> lol
[1:48:07] <KruxisV> 66K real good when you have no weapon
[1:48:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @kaisersnk any advice for our struggling
[1:48:10] <TurtleButter> @lucaflow he knows.
[1:48:16] <+Dreday543> @KaiserSNK as someone who doesnt have the game but would like to get into it. What tips can you give me outside of Footsies rule all
[1:48:17] <KruxisV> get the knockdown
[1:48:20] <Monkeyweed21> u iz ultra bitch
[1:48:21] <+QueenConstanze> admiralC
[1:48:21] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:48:28] <%castarts> again
[1:48:33] <%ProtagonistJake> You know can disarm when you don’t have a weapon right?
[1:48:36] <%bevyrage> what about trying to disarm him when you lost your weapon?
[1:48:36] <+AngriestAngryArtist> that might be mid predictabo and not high
[1:48:37] <Hydrapissed> the CLOWnING begins
[1:48:39] <%bevyrage> style on him
[1:48:44] <+SolverCODO> Pat says "fuck your honor" both in returning the courtesy AND taking advantage of the courtesy more than once
[1:48:47] <%ProtagonistJake> I think it’s quarter circle light medium
[1:48:50] <+bromontana> man i cant wait to see this at evo
[1:49:05] <CalderGaming> despite all that running, jubei's dash part of his DP is not projectile invuln so don't try it
[1:49:18] <+Dreday543> dont worry @AngriestPat its a leraning experiece
[1:49:23] <Saltmeisterr> PAT
[1:49:27] <CalderGaming> YES HE DID IT RIGHT
[1:49:27] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, SAMSHO at EVO will be dope
[1:49:32] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> There she goes
[1:49:38] <CalderGaming> can't parry unarmed
[1:49:39] <KaiserSNK> @Youwereeatenbyalid @Dreday543 this is a game where you get better by playing more. It's always good to go into tutorial or practice and see what your character can do. Deflect into WFT or SSM is devastating, so practicing that is pretty OK.
[1:49:54] <lemonadeicecold> will paige ever stream bb or a souls game again?
[1:49:55] <jinking79> least your not facing Ukyo
[1:49:56] <runningfleet> use your rage

[1:51:12] <jinking79> oh shit Ukyo
[1:51:15] <+Wool> RTX was fun
[1:51:26] <MainMan_Jonadiah> It's time to watch this sick man do some sick flips
[1:51:34] <%FrustratedAF> ukyo, the big dick OG
[1:51:43] <+bobdobbz> Block high
[1:51:51] <samsstand> O
[1:51:53] <Crankthulhu> monkaS
[1:51:56] <MainMan_Jonadiah> YO! I didn't know Jubei's parries did that much, holy shpit

[1:52:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> He has tuberculosis, doesn't he
[1:52:04] <KruxisV> all of ukyo's sword normals are mids
[1:52:05] <Saltmeisterr> ah so close

[1:52:07] <EnviTheFool> Yeah, they're nuts if you get them off
[1:52:08] <jinking79> damn close to that win
[1:52:09] <KaiserSNK> @Dreday543 running up and guard breaking (grabbing a character) is a good way to get some easy damage in by attacking after. Also, Rage Exploding stops time and allows players to use their Lightning Blade attack which can completely ruin the opponents day.
[1:52:11] <Monkeyweed21> he leveled SAM to 80
[1:52:28] <+bobdobbz> Always block high when somewhat close to Ukyo

[2:07:17] <CalderGaming> @AngriestPat it's unsafe on block but if you can land unarmed dashing L/M/H you'll get a knockdown with most characters and more time for weapon retrieval
[2:07:17] <TurtleButter> Nice.
[2:07:22] <KruxisV> wu is good but hard and underexplored
[2:07:23] <%FrustratedAF> F
[2:07:27] <oniwahoo> F
[2:07:27] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[2:07:27] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Nah, she's like mid. She's weird, but has her weird stuff
[2:07:30] <jinking79> almost
[2:07:32] <smallboops> its all about choke factor, slow slow slow it down
[2:07:35] <the_mad_mac130> Awww
[2:07:35] <$SvenHolgersson> Bm kicks
[2:07:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ..tha channel was 7 months ago
[2:07:37] <%TheStarbecue> im gonna go get pizza rolls and ice cream, hope Pat's still going when i get back
[2:07:38] <alrobot2014> 7 months ago was january
[2:07:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the*
[2:07:41] <%FrustratedAF> i know what happens 7 motnhs ago....
[2:07:48] <%FrustratedAF> wow i can't type tonight huh
[2:07:49] <Triplicat> the madman
[2:08:00] <KruxisV> only bad characters are kyoshiro and shiki
[2:08:03] <%FrustratedAF> 7 months of a sub streak would start in december......
[2:08:09] <alrobot2014> oh
[2:08:10] <%MoraMiarty> part of me wants to see haohmaru never come down from hat attack
[2:08:13] <MaxXtreme23> kyoshiro and shiki are bad?
[2:08:15] <Triplicat> AMAI WA
[2:08:17] <%MoraMiarty> just keep floating into the sky
[2:08:18] <smallboops> SPICY
[2:08:18] <CalderGaming> PREDICTABO
[2:08:18] <%FrustratedAF> i was looking forward to kyoshiro FeelsBadMan
[2:08:21] <%Solidnick18> yooooooo
[2:08:25] <Saltmeisterr> nice parry
[2:08:25] <oniwahoo> Nice
[2:08:27] <%foreverN2dust> that's the do it
[2:08:28] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @KruxisV Don't forget Yashamaru, he's trash too
[2:08:32] <the_mad_mac130> Awesome
[2:08:38] <CalderGaming> at this level of play who can say who's good or bad
[2:08:38] <KruxisV> yasha is not bad
[2:08:40] <Triplicat> did someone RE pat's DP on hit yet Kappa
[2:08:45] <%FrustratedAF> idk squig, pat got his shit slapped by a yashamaru earlier
[2:08:48] <Sulliman34> rip pow
[2:08:49] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I feel like Kyoshiro has some hidden tricks, he just doesn't play like any other character... And his dp isn't invincible for some stupid reason
[2:08:53] <the_mad_mac130> Damn right out of the gate with that move
[2:08:55] <TurtleButter> @CalderGaming I can :)
[2:08:58] <$TehPryceIsRight> Shiki is bad because you can activate before her DP comes out and hit her with it when she touches the ground
[2:09:01] <CalderGaming> we are not in tier list relevancy here lol
[2:09:03] <MaxXtreme23> i found that one of the tricks with kyoshiro is that his chip damage is massive
[2:09:06] <KruxisV> his specials are really unsafe but his normals are good and double jump is good
[2:09:09] <Sulliman34> you get a medium after a throw right?
[2:09:15] <KruxisV> he's better than darli, i think
[2:09:15] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @FrustratedAF Well yeah, just cus the character's bad doesn't mean he can't win
[2:09:16] <Triplicat> varies wildly by char
[2:09:16] <%FrustratedAF> i just wonder how well pat would do without lookin at chat
[2:09:20] <$SvenHolgersson> Shiki has hardest hittin normals at least
[2:09:21] <Saltmeisterr> pat you gotta stop being PREDICTIBO with your lightning blade
[2:09:21] <+bobdobbz> Use jubei’s Overhead. Triangle + O
[2:09:27] <MaxXtreme23> if you can get enough reads on the opponent with your wacky moves, you can chip them to death pretty reliably
[2:09:28] <Triplicat> I thiiink Jubei gets 2C after throw?
[2:09:33] <%TheStarbecue> Shiki and Kyoshiro are actually my secondaries lol, damn man i made bad picks
[2:09:41] <%Hammerknife> pat switched characters? wtf
[2:09:42] <haisho> ugh WHM doesn't get any new toys from 18 to 30
[2:09:43] <Solidus0101> Better to follow a throw with 2H
[2:09:44] <Metalfox1342> Hope you are doing well today Pat!
[2:09:44] <haisho> that sucks
[2:09:47] <CalderGaming> @Triplicat yup. and can frametrap sometimes with 5C
[2:09:53] <%FrustratedAF> pat's probably trying a bunch of the cast tonight
[2:09:59] <%FrustratedAF> can't wait for him to be an EQ main Kappa
[2:10:01] <haveswordmuststing> @thestarbecue on the bright side no one will bother to learn the matchup Kappa
[2:10:04] <KruxisV> i mean, also it's week 3 lol, so maybe kyo and shiki are good but it's really hard to see why right now
[2:10:07] <bear_breaker20> chad last hit
[2:10:12] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @TheStarbecue Saul Goodman, unless you're going to tournaments, tier lists are more like suggestions.
[2:10:13] <+bobdobbz> Use overhead
[2:10:15] <oniwahoo> Pat is not faring well against that person
[2:10:21] <+bobdobbz> Triangle + O
[2:10:24] <CalderGaming> muh frames
[2:10:24] <+sirminj> 2h is normally a little quicker
[2:10:26] <KruxisV> yeah jubei overhead is really good
[2:10:34] <KruxisV> long range, low crush, knocks down
[2:10:35] <%FrustratedAF> i assume this is a learning experience night. also isn't overhead a shoulder/trigger on pad?
[2:10:38] <%TheStarbecue> @haveswordmuststing im familiar with this feeling lol
[2:10:44] <CalderGaming> yup
[2:10:44] <%tinyswampthing> tier lists before the first six month of a game releasse are usually bs
[2:10:47] <Triplicat> ya
[2:10:54] <MaxXtreme23> yea
[2:10:54] <Triplicat> the ryu overhead
[2:10:54] <%Hammerknife> wao ryu grew his hair out
[2:11:05] <%TheStarbecue> @MainMan_Jonadiah i almost always play low tier anyway, doest bother me
[2:11:15] <%Hammerknife> that move is from a tales game
[2:11:18] <Triplicat> F
[2:11:31] <MaxXtreme23> pretty sure samsho existed before most tales games
[2:11:34] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @TheStarbecue Would you say you're a Low... Tier... GOD?!
[2:11:44] <切捨御免> yeah you should
[2:11:56] <Sulliman34> you should meaty with overhead
[2:11:57] <InugamiTheHound> the chat did tell your DP is bad and can be punished
[2:11:59] <oniwahoo> close
[2:12:02] <%TheStarbecue> @MainMan_Jonadiah double no, lol
[2:12:07] <%Hammerknife> samsho was 93, ToP was 95
[2:12:16] <%Hammerknife> huh i thought samsho was 96
[2:12:18] <%tinyswampthing> the funny thing is ltg doesn't even play low tier anymore
[2:12:22] <Triplicat> don't you love the feeling of doing or seeing something and knowing the round is over like 3 seconds in advance
[2:12:22] <CalderGaming> meaties are a tricky proposition when you can roll forward or back on wakeup
[2:12:23] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Jubei's universal overhed is godlike
[2:12:26] <wrydiculous> he jumps a lot, so....
[2:12:38] <KruxisV> hell yeah
[2:12:45] <%Hammerknife> wow whiffing throws in this game is so horrible
[2:12:49] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I've NEVER seen LTG play Low-tier
[2:12:55] <formalcasting> Fuck this game looks so satisfying
[2:12:59] <MaxXtreme23> y'know this game is great and i love it, but man do i miss last blade lol
[2:13:00] <%tearknack> i mean i don't know if that move would ahve been in Tales of Phantasia
[2:13:01] <$SvenHolgersson> Great counter bruh
[2:13:07] <%tearknack> so
[2:13:18] <Triplicat> LOL
[2:13:18] <%Hammerknife> it was, the stab flurry was in every game
[2:13:19] <KruxisV> normal throws are command throws and having a command throw means you have a normal throw
[2:13:19] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> LOL
[2:13:20] <$TehPryceIsRight> oh nice
[2:13:20] <CalderGaming> lol
[2:13:23] <Sulliman34> yooooo that setup was OD
[2:13:26] <Hydrapissed> uhhh ill take it?
[2:13:27] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Wow, that was goofy
[2:13:33] <wrydiculous> oof
[2:13:35] <%Solidnick18> greed
[2:13:37] <Sulliman34> dont forget your 2 supers pat
[2:13:39] <+bobdobbz> OH then low for when he’s almost dead
[2:13:40] <wrydiculous> too greedy
[2:13:52] <Triplicat> ahaha, that definitely does not work
[2:13:55] <bear_breaker20> this game make mvc combos seem so masturbatory lmao
[2:14:01] <CalderGaming> issen AA
[2:14:08] <Triplicat> AMAI WA
[2:14:08] <wrydiculous> dun just throw it out
[2:14:14] <InugamiTheHound> pat pulling out raw supers is not gonna work, going raw won't work this time
[2:14:16] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> YEAH
[2:14:18] <Hydrapissed> o0o0o0o0o0o0
[2:14:20] <CalderGaming> prrrrrredictabo
[2:14:20] <+OkamiDude15> woopsMB yoooo
[2:14:21] <%Keaton_x> Noice
[2:14:22] <Sulliman34> nice counters! good jump reads
[2:14:22] <RantingRavager> IN TWO
[2:14:23] <%WheatlyXT> WheatlyXT subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Do thing, fight yeah.
[2:14:24] <wrydiculous> yeet
[2:14:25] <$SvenHolgersson> Yeyeye
[2:14:25] <%AquilaHarukaze> IN HALF?!
[2:14:26] <%Hammerknife> take the points and run
[2:14:26] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Now there's TWO Haohmaru's
[2:14:28] <oniwahoo> nice, Pat
[2:14:29] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Man I love Jubei's chunky-ass counters
[2:14:31] <MaxXtreme23> yeah, one of the most reliable ways to issen people that i've seen is to hit them with it right before they land
[2:14:39] <haisho> this game makes most combos look masturbatory
[2:14:39] <Hydrapissed> combos = sadisim btw
[2:14:44] <%TheStarbecue> but masturbation is fun
[2:14:44] <+chrimbooooo> is there a demo for this on ps4 still
[2:14:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> ....but can you cut Nakoruru in half
[2:14:52] <mayorrev> masturbation is fun
[2:14:53] <Triplicat> yep
[2:14:54] <bear_breaker20> ohh serotonin thnx*
[2:14:56] <TheDr0t> when is this game coming to pc?
[2:14:59] <Triplicat> winter
[2:15:02] <Sulliman34> isnt fatboi slim the best character rn
[2:15:04] <CalderGaming> pat gambles on heavies A LOT
[2:15:05] <MainMan_Jonadiah> You know what's better than any combo? A counterhit Genjuro heavy slash
[2:15:19] <%Hammerknife> so how much additional damage is added on a parry counterhit
[2:15:53] <$TehPryceIsRight> @MainMan_Jonadiah The extra pauise the game gives you on heavy hits landing makes it even better
[2:16:15] <+TheOneCalledRock> OH MY HEART SANK
[2:16:26] <%Hammerknife> pretty hard to do an unconfirmed super?
[2:16:31] <+futer> PAT NO
[2:16:39] <Sulliman34> poke him with mids!
[2:16:40] <Triplicat> varies wildly by character
[2:16:44] <+solzan2000> issen
[2:16:48] <+OkamiDude15> YOU FOOL
[2:16:50] <%Hammerknife> hahahaha
[2:16:52] <KruxisV> cancel your recoil into fireball every now and then, pat
[2:16:53] <MaxXtreme23> he got lamed out
[2:16:54] <+solzan2000> nooo
[2:16:55] <Hydrapissed> PAT swingggggggggg
[2:16:57] <wrydiculous> oof
[2:16:57] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I was looking at that timer the WHOLE time, just panicking
[2:16:59] <+futer> nymnKek
[2:17:01] <%snow_bush> You lamed yourself out
[2:17:02] <%FrustratedAF> cross shodown Kappa
[2:17:08] <+linSP> i couldnt tell who lost just from their time out poses
[2:17:10] <%TheStarbecue> time outs are the most honorable
[2:17:11] <Triplicat> jubei's WFT and SSM are both on the slow side
[2:17:12] <TheDr0t> king crimson
[2:17:14] <YungxFisher> i did :)
[2:17:16] <+solzan2000> issen to freeze time
[2:17:24] <InugamiTheHound> sacrifice your friends for more time on the clock
[2:17:39] <Sulliman34> you hit him frame 1 of his jump so he got a punish
[2:17:41] <Sulliman34> odd interaction
[2:17:46] <krymzen5> almost everyone can cancel outa mediums. usually a close medium
[2:18:01] <MaxXtreme23> lot of odd interactions in this game tbh
[2:18:01] <Sulliman34> i feel like pat is too defensive without using defensive tools
[2:18:02] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Not Kyoshiro :I
[2:18:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Why does pat keep jumping into that circle swing attack?
[2:18:10] <+UltraShagohod> rawrPls
[2:18:12] <bear_breaker20> @InugamiTheHound that could be a mechanic tbh
[2:18:12] <tungstenviper> Clap
[2:18:12] <JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> gottem
[2:18:17] <+TheOneCalledRock> damn
[2:18:20] <%Solidnick18> the 3rd strike
[2:18:23] <+OkamiDude15> no one ever expects the second swallow
[2:18:23] <wrydiculous> wow
[2:18:24] <%Solidnick18> oh
[2:18:25] <CalderGaming> fun da men tals
[2:18:25] <$TehPryceIsRight> OHNO
[2:18:25] <Sulliman34> wait howd he do 2 of those, pow gauge?
[2:18:25] <Triplicat> whoops
[2:18:27] <%Solidnick18> welp
[2:18:27] <+bromontana> close
[2:18:32] <wrydiculous> oh no
[2:18:41] <DJMesoPhunk> that super only consumes the gauge if it lands or its time runs out
[2:18:45] <KruxisV> you dont lose your meter until it hits @Sulliman34
[2:18:49] <MainMan_Jonadiah> You can keep doing supers until they hit or you run out of angry-time
[2:18:55] <Sulliman34> ooooh ok
[2:19:03] <JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> no absolute block? as in you have to hold back the whole time?
[2:19:05] <DJMesoPhunk> everyone has one rage super that acts that way, and then another "hidden" super they can do whenever, but they can only do it once whether it lands or whiffs
[2:19:06] <Triplicat> yes
[2:19:11] <+greenmoose11915> that setup reminded me of an episode of best friends from whereever ago. where pat had stated the best move to do right after a super is another super. because nobody thinks youre ever going to do 2 supers in a row. and it worked out pretty well there
[2:19:13] <KruxisV> yes @JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS
[2:19:17] <MainMan_Jonadiah> There's a perfect block
[2:19:20] <$TehPryceIsRight> Can Jubei super super to punish whiffed DP?
[2:19:22] <krymzen5> this gen should shoryu pats jumpins more
[2:19:24] <CalderGaming> nice
[2:19:24] <JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> so neutral guard is not a thing in this game?
[2:19:27] <Triplicat> everyone can
[2:19:36] <JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> oh alright
[2:19:38] <shotgunspaghetti> so you know how like when you go to a restaurant and get a soda but the soda is just fucking sugar soda water that tastes really bad? cause FUCKING SAME.
[2:19:40] <Triplicat> SSM start up is about 30f on average
[2:19:50] <Triplicat> DP whiffing is minus get fucked frames
[2:19:54] <KruxisV> true blockstrings do not exist in this game
[2:19:56] <%TheStarbecue> absolute block, its called
[2:19:56] <tungstenviper> God you suck pat Kappa
[2:19:56] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:20:00] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Wait is pat not holding back or?
[2:20:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Non sequitur coming through. I was just informed Costco sells caskets. I just asked if I should get pizza. :(
[2:20:14] <%Hammerknife> @Youwereeatenbyalid pat's first day on samsho
[2:20:16] <krymzen5> ouch
[2:20:21] <JoveGar> just block bro
[2:20:21] <MainMan_Jonadiah> The dp's are strong this round
[2:20:23] <MrDonTacos_> damn son
[2:20:24] <%FrostMass22> Yeah, Pat is hiding his power level rn
[2:20:26] <%brickwall35> Pat, try doing better
[2:20:28] <tungstenviper> SeemsGood
[2:20:30] <krymzen5> thats the haoh ik
[2:20:33] <%Psyramics> he's learning how to fight you faster than you're learning how to fight him
[2:20:36] <Triplicat> cool netplay
[2:20:36] <Sulliman34> how much fucking tekken did you play that corrupted your mind into neutral block
[2:20:37] <benjiFG> they have a lot of blood
[2:20:40] <+chemtrailsgaming> pat's basically diago 2
[2:20:42] <TheDr0t> pat is using 12% of his power
[2:20:42] <JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> @Sulliman34 Lmao
[2:20:45] <tungstenviper> PAt justos top losing SeemsGood
[2:20:49] <%Hammerknife> also i dont know if pat played any of the old samsho
[2:20:53] <%FrustratedAF> remember, guys, pat plays grapplers Kappa
[2:20:57] <%FrostMass22> Pat is just letting a new player have it easy
[2:20:58] <KruxisV> remember, heavies are slow, press them early for DP punishes
[2:21:03] <Triplicat> there's some h o n e s t mixup
[2:21:08] <CalderGaming> phew
[2:21:10] <+OkamiDude15> sick
[2:21:10] <MasterCosmic> using 123%
[2:21:11] <krymzen5> nice
[2:21:11] <%Solidnick18> OH
[2:21:12] <Zhwoobatte> PogChamp
[2:21:12] <KruxisV> like, if you can see haoh on the screen afterward, press it
[2:21:14] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat hold back to block
[2:21:14] <%tearknack> the community rep said jubei was their favourite character, and now their gone. *looks at gameplay* I wonder why?
[2:21:15] <%FrustratedAF> GOTTEM
[2:21:16] <%Solidnick18> lucky
[2:21:16] <Triplicat> bye rage gauge

[2:22:20] <CalderGaming> pat your best non-super punish as jubei off a throw is crouch H or, in corner, stand H
[2:22:20] <MainMan_Jonadiah> That did not look like it should've worked
[2:22:21] <Triplicat> that definitely should not have worked
[2:22:21] <%blaccbird914> BRUH

[2:22:51] <KruxisV> he does but he forgets to do it
[2:22:53] <Triplicat> the funny thing is that he was already doing it
[2:22:57] <oceanmatt> only on mediums
[2:22:58] <Triplicat> he did it with DP several times
[2:23:01] <%BeastlyP1ays> BeastlyP1ays subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[2:23:05] <Triplicat> no, it's on any normal that has a recoil animation
[2:23:20] <%kiiiirsten> Oh shit I didn't know it was samurai shodown nite
[2:23:24] <Sulliman34> jubei dp seems like trash
[2:23:25] <oceanmatt> really even heavies
[2:23:29] <%Hammerknife> there's something really workmanlike about how these games play out visually

[2:23:46] <tungstenviper> monkaS !?
[2:23:48] <CalderGaming> ...but jubei close stand H after throw in corner is a tight timing like genjuro throw into crouch H

[2:24:47] <$SvenHolgersson> Genjuro is pussy shit tho
[2:24:47] <%llamington> Ahahahaah IF ONLY BLOCK THEN JUBEI CEASES TO BE
[2:24:50] <InugamiTheHound> try another character like Tachibana?
[2:24:51] <Zombrocom> Hit buttons is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what to do in this game
[2:24:55] <CalderGaming> the suboptimal throw damage NotLikeThis
[2:24:58] <shotgunspaghetti> but the mortgage though
[2:25:00] <%Hammerknife> did that normal do like 30%
[2:25:01] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Just parry EVERYTHING and say "Predictabo."

[2:25:35] <CalderGaming> working on not blowing resources in round 1 is for later
[2:25:40] <%thelaxinator> Is jubei just solidus? He even sounds like him.
[2:25:48] <wrydiculous> samsho, the game where it's legal to lame it out
[2:25:53] <tungstenviper> why do you keep parrying so early?
[2:26:07] <KishinGrek> Was samsho V any good?
[2:26:13] <President_valentine> Yeah
[2:26:15] <krymzen5> 5s fun

[2:26:36] <Hydrapissed> CLASH
[2:26:41] <Triplicat> which one, didn't see
[2:26:41] <MaxXtreme23> huh nobody was disarmed
[2:26:42] <KruxisV> A DRAW
[2:26:47] <CalderGaming> @KishinGrek the rebalance of it, samsho v special, is considered one of the best
[2:26:50] <MaxXtreme23> one time in a clash, both people actually got disarmed
[2:26:57] <MaxXtreme23> so now i'm confused on how it works in a draw situation
[2:27:09] <KishinGrek> Ded
[2:27:10] <krymzen5> well played
[2:27:11] <deviljhojho94> Good run
[2:27:13] <Hydrapissed> THE RUN in and GRAB
[2:27:15] <+bobdobbz> In training need to learn best normal into special after throw. Usually Med cancel into DP
[2:27:15] <Hydrapissed> works every time
[2:27:27] <Triplicat> for jubei it's 2H

[2:27:43] <DJMesoPhunk> it depends how m uch mashing was involved in the clash. it usually ends in neither getting disarmed online honestly

[2:29:13] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> ESPECIALLY against earthquake
[2:29:14] <Triplicat> might be the command grab? or you're doing A tsubaki that doesn't hit
[2:29:17] <Triplicat> lol
[2:29:18] <%MoraMiarty> this guy has too many swords
[2:29:26] <JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> He needs more swords
[2:29:26] <KishinGrek> I am way too intimidated to get this game, and its getting worse as time goes by
[2:29:27] <CalderGaming> fireball forward, jumping fireball forward, fireball back, DP slash, reverse DP, DP kick
[2:29:37] <$SvenHolgersson> Not nuff swords
[2:29:38] <%Psyramics> why does he need 5 swords, is he gonna start Killer Beeing it up?
[2:29:45] <President_valentine> 7 swords
[2:29:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Not even holding a sword in his mouth.
[2:29:46] <%FrustratedAF> he has a command back-throw, right?
[2:29:46] <%CerberusDriver> he has 7 swords
[2:29:48] <Sokumotanaka> sup you freaking nerds
[2:29:48] <MainMan_Jonadiah> How many swords is enough swords? 2? 3, like Zoro style?
[2:29:53] <DaPlyte> that's your simple combo ender
[2:29:53] <+bobdobbz> Just spam J Heavy
[2:29:53] <CalderGaming> Woolie keeps saying Yoshitora was designed by the Trigun artist but it was the Rurouni Kenshin artist :P
[2:29:53] <Triplicat> he does
[2:29:54] <KishinGrek> Yoshis a weeb
[2:29:54] <%FrustratedAF> or is regular back throw one of the flowers?

[2:30:35] <CalderGaming> @angriestpat set the dummy to all guard to see if it really combos after throw
[2:30:38] <+bobdobbz> Yes
[2:30:43] <jinking79> back to zero
[2:30:44] <Triplicat> overhead
[2:30:45] <MaxXtreme23> you can combo his mid into pink blossoms L to mix them up with a low
[2:30:46] <Traysanford161> @kishingrek its ok this game is basically huge payout or bankruptcy can't help but be intimidated
[2:31:02] <jinking79> that's one
[2:31:02] <KruxisV> you can tiger knee it, pretty sure
[2:31:12] <Triplicat> key for that-- you can do M+H overhead and then do that move to get it out without having to TK it
[2:31:14] <+bobdobbz> Back throw heavy into qcf+square
[2:31:15] <CalderGaming> all guard for testing lows and highs both
[2:31:15] <DaPlyte> 1 hit guard is block after first hit, but it takes a while to reset
[2:31:18] <Triplicat> because overhead has him jump up
[2:31:22] <+OkamiDude15> biggest manly sneeze
[2:31:23] <KishinGrek> I totally get that
[2:31:33] <reiju_22> post-con sickness :(

[2:31:48] <+bobdobbz> Cancel that heavy into special @angriestpat
[2:31:50] <Triplicat> it is actually not an overhead
[2:31:50] <CalderGaming> no that's a mid
[2:31:53] <MainMan_Jonadiah> After those 3 big stabs you can cancel into a special move
[2:31:54] <Suwaiya> not overhead
[2:31:55] <Zombrocom> It's not an overhead

[2:34:10] <+bobdobbz> Jump
[2:34:13] <+bobdobbz> In air

[2:34:29] <+bobdobbz> Do it in air
[2:34:34] <%TehPryceIsRight> If you do it right but dont have all unlocked he fails to pull out the sword
[2:34:35] <Zombrocom> It's a GG super
[2:34:39] <agadejobi> When's the Rimururu/Nakoruru playthrough
[2:34:41] <Triplicat> you do not do it in the air.
[2:34:47] <+senfood> You have to put in work for 7
[2:34:48] <$SvenHolgersson> He does a fake one if you don tdo all 6
[2:34:49] <CalderGaming> is the menuing resetting the count

[2:35:37] <+Boatload_of_Waffles> Wow.. Earthquake didn't listen to cookie monster when he said "cookies are a sometimes food"..
[2:35:39] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Jumping heavy is your friend as well
[2:35:47] <%GarbageNirvana> How many swords is too many swords
[2:35:49] <tungstenviper> Best character in the game
[2:35:50] <%Skrypto> SAH-SUH-DAY-OH
[2:35:52] <KishinGrek> I like how Earthquake looks a lot better than rufus
[2:35:58] <Triplicat> so you keep your unlock progress between rounds but it relocks after the round you unlock it
[2:35:58] <MaxXtreme23> unrelated but earthquake's theme is a fucking banger
[2:36:00] <%TehPryceIsRight> Jumping heavy is so dirty it can cross up for no reason depending on when you hit the button
[2:36:02] <%CerberusDriver> dont let Yoshi get his 7th sword basically
[2:36:03] <+greenmoose11915> that does soooo much damage. that was 70% of his life
[2:36:06] <+bobdobbz> You can do his air special off OH quickly
[2:36:10] <KruxisV> everrything's bigger in texas
[2:36:21] <KruxisV> including ninjas

[2:58:17] <alrobot2014> oh its wool
[2:58:18] <optosi> no, it can be between rounds, but you lose the 7th special after the round you unlock it in
[2:58:18] <%ProtagonistJake> i wish i saw her fuck

[2:58:25] <%ProtagonistJake> me
[2:58:27] <tungstenviper> S B O N K
[2:58:39] <%ArcanumMBD> ArcanumMBD subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Pat thanks for giving me a crippling FF14 addiction. In case you missed it, EDF5 came out on PC today, after the PC port got announced 3 days ago. Literally out of nowhere. Shit's great, runs smooth as butter.
[2:58:41] <%fFailureatlife> Yall like zoning
[2:58:44] <+bobdobbz> you only get 7th for the round it was unlocked though
[2:59:01] <jinking79> @KruxisV really

[2:59:03] <+player2side> shes a trap zoner
[2:59:05] <ShichiNoBushi> *MOAN* *GASP* *SIGH*

[2:59:08] <%tinyswampthing> i do
[2:59:12] <%Solidnick18> true
[2:59:13] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> He plays grapplers of course he doesn't like zoning
[2:59:13] <optosi> hi scrubquotes
[2:59:16] <mayorrev> pat getting salty
[2:59:16] <President_valentine> says the grappler main
[2:59:18] <+steak_bentley> i like vortexing zoners
[2:59:21] <+Jaysky> She's a trap Kreygasm zoner
[2:59:23] <CalderGaming> @levit8960 9 hits in skullgirls isn't much but it's a start. the more damage you do with a combo the fewer chances you give your opponent to defend correctly, but if you learn neutral play and can break open their defense you don't need that chance reduction
[2:59:26] <DiasFox> proud to be a loser
[2:59:30] <tungstenviper> Are you really a loser if you keep winning?
[2:59:31] <%Menitta> You can be a legit loser
[2:59:34] <%tearknack> i like hitting people with a thing that goes clang, or a drum
[2:59:35] <mayorrev> "Zoning is for losers" @scrubquotes
[2:59:35] <KruxisV> yeah, you can unlock it over all three rounds if you need to, but if you unlock it in round 2 it's not available in round 3
[2:59:46] <DaPlyte> you do the slide after iirc
[2:59:46] <YungxFisher> do the 7 sword thing pls

[2:59:53] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[3:00:07] <TheEvilOmega> That character is Blanka
[3:00:17] <CalderGaming> @levit8960 the game is very mature at this point so the usual combos to run with any character are well-documented so you can practice at your leisure
[3:00:22] <TheEvilOmega> Woolie uses her, doesn't he?

[3:08:25] <KruxisV> instead of raw after throw
[3:08:57] <EnviTheFool> @AngriestPat Hello
[3:08:58] <%Menitta> Look at this guy with a Yakuza 0 avatar
[3:09:03] <+AngriestAngryArtist> oh yeah after 3 stab from close heavy pizza cutter
[3:09:09] <MainMan_Jonadiah> It's Harvey Birdman
[3:09:12] <tungstenviper> there are combos still --> DO THEM
[3:09:14] <%ArcanumMBD> How is Shiki in this game? She seemed kinda weak when I messed around with her in practice
[3:09:17] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Bishi bishi tengu boy
[3:09:19] <+Anonymasque> What would be crazy good internets? Thinking about upgrading my net soon..
[3:09:21] <%fFailureatlife> shiki sucks
[3:09:24] <YungxFisher> do the blue one after this game its cool lookin
[3:09:28] <TyrantBelial> It's the OC.
[3:09:36] <%Menitta> @fFailureatlife you dont like anyone in this game
[3:09:44] <TyrantBelial> yeah but Shiki's hot.
[3:09:44] <%fFailureatlife> no i mean she isnt good
[3:09:52] <%fFailureatlife> low tier
[3:10:03] <haisho> jesus christ the instaqueues as healer in FFXIV is insane
[3:10:04] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @ArcanumMBD She's bad. She doesn't really have any good overheads and her command throw doesn'[t work on crouchers, so she has no good mixup tools despite being a rushdown character
[3:10:09] <Jeemukun> huh, yasha's colour reminds me of mitsunari's from sengoku basara
[3:10:12] <tungstenviper> Pat WTF
[3:10:16] <TheEvilOmega> This looks like a neat fighting game. Too bad I'm not in the market for one. Plus, too much FF14.
[3:10:29] <haisho> but of course, someone is trolling DF right now
[3:10:47] <MainMan_Jonadiah> He's just gunna chip you out
[3:10:49] <Zombrocom> Shiki does have the best super in the game thiough
[3:10:50] <+steak_bentley> high iq
[3:10:53] <+steak_bentley> PAT
[3:10:58] <jellymang> ...you can just spam that?
[3:11:00] <CalderGaming> pat that move only has one guard point anyway
[3:11:01] <jellymang> fuck this game
[3:11:02] <+DeaconBluesClues> ...
[3:11:02] <Zombrocom> Dude just isshin that
[3:11:03] <tungstenviper> monkaS . . .
[3:11:05] <$renyrells> you fell for it
[3:11:13] <%tearknack> novody would ever expect it 3 times in a row
[3:11:16] <InugamiTheHound> that color purple reminds of the purple "Mitsuhide" wears in samurai warriors
[3:11:19] <+steak_bentley> the ultimate mixup
[3:11:23] <Dragon_Batman> Isshin doesn't go full screen
[3:11:24] <$ESP_ROOT> !uptime
[3:11:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 11m.
[3:11:26] <TyrantBelial> Hell yeah Mitsuhide

[3:11:27] <+DeaconBluesClues> @renyrells thunder cross split attack
[3:11:32] <tungstenviper> it's active frame
[3:11:36] <Zombrocom> Isshin is invincible but not quite full screen
[3:11:37] <CalderGaming> isshin isn't true fullscreen
[3:11:50] <tungstenviper> if you're close enough of course
[3:11:51] <%Menitta> the hitstop is so good on this game
[3:11:54] <haveswordmuststing> its like 3/4 screen roughly
[3:11:57] <TyrantBelial> Yeah I don'ty think any grab can be done off of a parry.
[3:12:03] <InugamiTheHound> @TyrantBelial are you a fan of Mitsuhide or samurai warriors series?
[3:12:10] <TyrantBelial> Of all the warriors
[3:12:11] <CalderGaming> can't grab a hit/parrystunned character
[3:12:15] <TyrantBelial> I 100%'d Warriors Orochi 3

[3:15:41] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @AngriestPat Have to hit them jst befoire they land - Keep in mind that running has recovery so if you run up Issen you have to do it earlier

[3:17:46] <+Sulfur_Boride> So does Yoshitora actually draw, slash, then sheath each and all of his swords in a multislashing moving?
[3:17:46] <Someguy893> seven
[3:17:47] <DaPlyte> you can also do j.C while rising, it's crazy active

[3:18:01] <+Gulping> yoshi is mid-low
[3:18:03] <GraceAccent> they're all named after the women he's been with or something
[3:18:04] <+steak_bentley> rip seven swards
[3:18:05] <+ALTRNico> how does he smell with all those whiffs you take?
[3:18:07] <televisedrevolting> @plainsimpletailor Just in case.
[3:18:07] <Bluewolf544> If you have any less than 7 swords you are a loser in my book
[3:18:10] <EnviTheFool> Yeye, big pokey pokes
[3:18:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Too close to real life?
[3:18:15] <$ESP_ROOT> has this been the entire stream?
[3:18:15] <+Tyonidus> Hey you big nerd
[3:18:27] <CalderGaming> long normals? better go tam tam Kappa
[3:18:27] <$SvenHolgersson> jubei good
[3:18:29] <YungxFisher> tam tam?
[3:18:30] <DirtyMiser> jubei is boss
[3:18:31] <%PlainSimpleTailor> That guy treats swords how Pat treats controllers.
[3:18:32] <KruxisV> jubei charlotte and tam tam are the poke gods
[3:18:35] <President_valentine> Play Galford
[3:18:36] <MultipleJiggs> No just play the fat evil
[3:18:45] <Blank9> jubei will always remind me of onimusha 2, so he's great
[3:18:50] <TyrantBelial> I'm happy to see a massive lack of Nakoruru
[3:18:54] <theemotionalacehearts> but his jab combos into special
[3:18:58] <%fFailureatlife> be a tier whore play genjuro
[3:19:07] <InugamiTheHound> @Blank9 oh man Onimusha 2 is awesome
[3:19:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Nice to see the little guy moving up in the world
[3:19:14] <Zombrocom> Charlotte is the tier whore character
[3:19:24] <CalderGaming> tam tam isn't?
[3:19:27] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Nah, Genjuro's the tier whore, FOR SURE
[3:19:30] <+Qsmash_> what about tammy tam tam?
[3:19:30] <$ESP_ROOT> pat takes a game jermaVenus
[3:19:38] <+Gulping> Most of the characters are in the upper tiers right now except for yoshi, nakoruru, and kyoshiro
[3:19:38] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Tam Tam's just mean
[3:19:49] <CalderGaming> anyway beating a dead horse, tiers mean nothing at this level, etc.
[3:19:49] <%tinyswampthing> im ertain thats tam tam
[3:20:03] <+Gulping> Kyoshiro is Extremely Bottom Tier because he's got big stupid windup on everything
[3:20:10] <%supercasualboom> Let’s go Pat!!! I’m ready. Now to find you cause I can’t figure out the online lookup so easily
[3:20:10] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I saw a tier list today that had Yoshitora in S, mostly cuz of his jumping heavy
[3:20:11] <mr_ESB> Heard shiki struggles alot
[3:20:18] <$ESP_ROOT> i take it characters in this game wont receive too many changes
[3:20:20] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I gotta say, listening to Pat and Woolie describe this thing, this isn't what I thought it would be. I thought the damage would be MORE severe than this
[3:20:22] <+Gulping> nakoruru is bad because Tradition
[3:20:24] <President_valentine> Shiki is pretty bad
[3:20:24] <KruxisV> genjuro is the meme top tier, tam tam is the actual BS one
[3:20:33] <DaPlyte> do you mean yashamaru? because yoshi is hella good
[3:20:38] <%HAttilaTheFun> The air Force sends it's ships, the Navy sends it's jets
[3:20:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PlainSimpleTailor they're not good
[3:20:48] <CalderGaming> @PlainSimpleTailor that's because the really good counterhit reads and low-health issens aren't coming out
[3:20:55] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @PlainSimpleTailor Jabs do normal fighting game damage, supers and heavys are where it gets ridiculous
[3:20:58] <+steak_bentley> it depends on if you're the kind of person who gets fucked up by blanka or fucked up by evil ryu
[3:21:06] <BabyNaBackbrace> I thought I'd go for TAm Tam but learned he's OP and so I'm hunting for my main
[3:21:20] <KruxisV> just play tam, he's cool
[3:21:21] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @MainMan_Jonadiah oh... :(
[3:21:25] <DaPlyte> he isn't op, just very good
[3:21:32] <Zombrocom> @BabyNaBackbrace Play who you want, ignore tiers

[3:22:05] <Shwepie> Pat wins!
[3:22:13] <MultipleJiggs> Ok that was way better than your match with the other character.
[3:22:15] <+Gulping> Samsho is Good Punish the game like, so hard
[3:22:22] <MultipleJiggs> Was beginning to wonder you were just a scrub at this.
[3:22:23] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Jfc look at that full screen whiff punish
[3:22:27] <DirtyMiser> Are they adding in Genan Shiranui? I thought he was fun to play as
[3:22:36] <+steak_bentley> READ
[3:22:42] <BabyNaBackbrace> I guess I feel like Tam Tam's a bit too easy? I dunno Kyoshiro's pretty fun. Mostly I'm waiting for Basara and Wan Fu
[3:22:42] <+Qsmash_> don't jump :)
[3:22:44] <+Tyonidus> HOAHMARU
[3:22:44] <InugamiTheHound> Pat is true Scrublord
[3:22:50] <+ALTRNico> stop being brave always be a coward
[3:22:51] <KruxisV> the game is actually really balanced. top half are all really close and basically everyone can compete
[3:22:51] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Genan would be cool
[3:22:56] <+Gulping> gen-an is probably going to be the only one of the original cast who's not coming back
[3:23:03] <BabyNaBackbrace> I miss Genan
[3:23:10] <BabyNaBackbrace> and Seiger
[3:23:13] <%supercasualboom> I have to wait till Wan-Fu in feb 2020 sucks
[3:23:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Gen-an hasn't been in since, like, 3
[3:23:24] <haveswordmuststing> @gulping unless they do the right thing and put in Choi instead LUL
[3:23:26] <BabyNaBackbrace> yeah Wan Fu is the last to come out
[3:23:33] <MaxXtreme23> and kazuki is December
[3:23:34] <+steak_bentley> ill for sure check out basara
[3:23:35] <Zombrocom> Why does no one punish jubeis uppercut with SSM, it's -90
[3:23:36] <%Typhaeon> Just give me Amakusa
[3:23:42] <%supercasualboom> Wan fu with pillar is all right in the world though
[3:23:43] <+Gulping> What weapon is Wan-Fu going to bring to town
[3:23:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Same, Wan-Fu's going to be my main, I don't care if he's the worst in the game by a mile, he's my boy
[3:23:45] <+HunkleberryFine> so much dog
[3:23:48] <BabyNaBackbrace> Yeah Basara was my new pick for SS3
[3:23:52] <+Gulping> his gimmick is that he has a new weapon every time
[3:24:02] <%supercasualboom> @gulping He get the pillar

[3:24:16] <$ESP_ROOT> Clap
[3:24:19] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Apparently Wan-FU has his SS2 weapon
[3:24:25] <CalderGaming> yoshitora's best use is learning the japanese names of six types of flower Kappa
[3:24:27] <+steak_bentley> the dumb character i want is enja TakeNRG
[3:24:28] <mr_ESB> Pats mix up game on point?
[3:24:30] <+ALTRNico> yep
[3:24:32] <thespianlive> yep
[3:24:33] <+Gulping> the pillar is the dumbest weapon so therefore it's the best
[3:24:34] <%supercasualboom> Let’s go pat
[3:24:35] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Yeah, if you go to Wan-Fu's SNK Wiki page, it has a render of his model for this game

[3:35:02] <mr_ESB> Ukyo looks scary
[3:35:14] <zamzoph> TB monkaS
[3:35:15] <CalderGaming> @angriestpat those moves that push you away on block are the ones you can punish with Jubei's DP better than an lot of other characters
[3:35:17] <+Gulping> And here's Ukyo
[3:35:18] <krymzen5> ukyo takes skill
[3:35:25] <+steak_bentley> ukyo gang
[3:35:29] <+Gulping> he's been top tier since the dawn of time and that's never going to change
[3:35:30] <%ArcanumMBD> Gotta back throw to hit the WFT with Jubei
[3:35:30] <Crankthulhu> Seems like Jubei's Super has too much startup for the throw setup to work
[3:35:40] <%nanaki_ff14> Is Ukyo the character made by Rounin Kenshin creator?
[3:35:47] <%Wool> Wool subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Thanks for the games, and seeing you at RTX was cool! I lost a set to Woolie in Austin and won against you, so I guess it balances out.
[3:35:49] <Zombrocom> Ukyo is top tier off the back of Tsubame Gaeshi and thats about it
[3:35:52] <President_valentine> @nanaki_ff14 No that's Yoshitora
[3:35:55] <CalderGaming> @Crankthulhu gotta backthrow and suffer the increased damage scaling
[3:35:59] <+PJSmooth> @nanaki_ff14 Nah Yoshitora is
[3:35:59] <krymzen5> i thought 7 sword guy was?
[3:36:03] <%nanaki_ff14> ah got it
[3:36:05] <+Gulping> no ukyo has been part of the franchise since game one
[3:36:08] <Snektor> @AngriestPat Hey patt have you ever thought about bringing back "friday night fisticuffs"? Invite woolie and a few more fighting game boys and let the fun commence.
[3:36:12] <+UberWolfman> Tokugawa is Trigun mangaka

[3:36:22] <+steak_bentley> 50/50 king
[3:36:25] <Crankthulhu> @CalderGaming It looks like the window is super thin even it even exists, like 1 frame after the throw
[3:36:26] <+Gulping> Pat doesn't want to play games with other people like that anymore
[3:36:36] <CalderGaming> @UberWolfman woolie was wrong it's the kenshin mangaka

[3:45:26] <%GyroBrando> NICE
[3:45:34] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Depending on who you ask, the toppest top tier in this game is either Genjuro or Tam Tam
[3:45:35] <+Gulping> Like, Unist is a lot more based on shit that's universal
[3:45:43] <+Gulping> Samsho is its own beast
[3:45:50] <$ESP_ROOT> hey this game looks cool
[3:46:01] <graemecrackers1> Nani
[3:46:01] <+Gulping> Samsho is the fighting game that's not about combo
[3:46:01] <MasterDecoder> So you're the one to blame
[3:46:04] <%mistersups> True.
[3:46:10] <%wolfofsound> @ESP_ROOT Yeah, I wish I were good at fighting games to warrant the buy
[3:46:12] <+Gulping> Samsho is about doing 40% on normals
[3:46:19] <$ESP_ROOT> @wolfofsound me too :(
[3:46:24] <Goldenwolf98> Pat
[3:46:34] <graemecrackers1> wielding two swords is dumb
[3:46:37] <+Gulping> your jab does heavy punch damage and your heavy punch does a billion
[3:46:38] <President_valentine> haha
[3:46:42] <MultipleJiggs> One day pat's patented double super technique will actually work
[3:46:43] <%Wool> Wielding 7 swords is better
[3:46:47] <graemecrackers1> katanas re two handed weapons
[3:46:49] <SForlord> I only like playing arena fighters, buy only like watching 2D fighters. Is there something wrong with me?
[3:46:50] <mr_ESB> Yea im hearing genjuro and Tam Tam alot. Curious how Evo will go
[3:46:55] <CalderGaming> @graemecrackers1 it worked for musashi... somehow
[3:47:00] <$ESP_ROOT> monkaS
[3:47:03] <%mastertwin2> this guy tryna lame it out
[3:47:08] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> @AngriestPat whats the etiquette on rematches?
[3:47:08] <%brickwall35> ultimate footsies
[3:47:09] <Zombrocom> Charlotte and Ukyo are also amazing
[3:47:10] <%wolfofsound> musashi haxed with the sun
[3:47:14] <TurtleButter> this is ridiculously tense.
[3:47:19] <TurtleButter> nice

[3:47:22] <%tearknack> YEAH
[3:47:23] <californaya> God, what a shitter
[3:47:23] <CalderGaming> CEO samsho was kind of sad to start out because it was clear how little had been figured out
[3:47:25] <$ESP_ROOT> jeez
[3:47:26] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I've never felt a tension like this!
[3:47:29] <+arcturusblade> can you anti-air with that heavy slash?
[3:47:30] <FunkyStreams> dooope
[3:47:39] <$ESP_ROOT> jump jump
[3:47:40] <President_valentine> i misread that as musashi haxed with gun
[3:47:48] <%Verd_254> so much jumping
[3:47:49] <Pnutz409> unclench is not an option just yet. man this is intense
[3:47:49] <CalderGaming> hopefully EVO isn't cory and justin just trouncing everyone
[3:47:50] <%optosi> does he know you can walk
[3:47:53] <%wolfofsound> @President_valentine can you prove he didn't? Kappa
[3:47:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fighting on coals
[3:47:58] <FunkyStreams> oof
[3:48:00] <MainMan_Jonadiah> This man over here playing SFV
[3:48:02] <scubacat_> Samsho is really approachable for new players tbh justtry v special on fightcade if you're unsure about buying 7
[3:48:03] <$ESP_ROOT> i see... jumping is the meta
[3:48:04] <televisedrevolting> @caldergaming Remember that time Musashi challenged a guy, showed up late, and ambushed him with an oar?
[3:48:07] <TurtleButter> what a shitter.
[3:48:09] <+TheyCallMeVawn> SamSho is going to be crazy at EVO

[3:49:50] <deviljhojho94> not me :)
[3:49:52] <Pnutz409> Lagi must have been a pokemon
[3:49:54] <%fFailureatlife> well then whats the point FeelsBadMan
[3:49:55] <$ESP_ROOT> no :)
[3:49:56] <%Wool> Are you salty enough for a runback @AngriestPat since no one is joining
[3:49:56] <+Gulping> Lagi is fought underwater
[3:49:58] <+LoudButtons> pc when
[3:49:59] <%Faustgesicht> and then he comes out next trailer
[3:50:00] <krymzen5> i already took my lumps
[3:50:02] <MultipleJiggs> I just miss the Seltas.
[3:50:04] <+Gulping> and is on the leviathan skeleton
[3:50:12] <$ESP_ROOT> @Gulping you fight him on land in generations
[3:50:12] <+Gulping> which they can't make work
[3:50:13] <+SleazyShell> lagi sucks for the same reasons khezu sucks
[3:50:15] <%tearknack> ah
[3:50:19] <+Polter_ge1st> @tearknack they tried to add lagi but they couldn't get his frame to work
[3:50:22] <%mistersups> Maybe casual match??
[3:50:22] <FunkyStreams> @AngriestPat whatever happened with that bet you made with Paige about you continuing to play Warframe after having spent 120 bucks on it?
[3:50:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> probably meant through PSN
[3:50:24] <+LoudButtons> el chakotay?!
[3:50:26] <StuffHunter> Ivory Lagiacrus was fought on land exclusivly.
[3:50:27] <%DMJohndrow> DMJohndrow subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Glad to see you playing some SamSho, hoping you're enjoying it so far!
[3:50:34] <eyedol33> @SForlord its lagicrus
[3:50:36] <%tearknack> the only monster hunter game i ever played was 3 for wii
[3:50:43] <+Gulping> like nothing of value was lost lagi is like, the worst flagship
[3:50:43] <MaxXtreme23> hey it me
[3:50:44] <%tearknack> i loved it
[3:50:51] <deviljhojho94> did you guys know tam tam is hot
[3:50:52] <eyedol33> @SForlord *Lagiacrus
[3:50:53] <deviljhojho94> under that mask
[3:50:58] <%Faustgesicht> Doesn't the Odogon in the trailer basically confirm Gore Magala?
[3:51:00] <%supercasualboom> 🤷♀️
[3:51:07] <$ESP_ROOT> monkaS
[3:51:12] <TyrantBelial> no odo was a dragon element subspecies
[3:51:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Play overwatch
[3:51:18] <televisedrevolting> Speaking of Miyamoto Musashi, sword people, and Saski Kojiro, everyone go read Vagabond.
[3:51:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> How much money did you spend on that
[3:51:21] <FunkyStreams> we'll see
[3:51:22] <$ESP_ROOT> how do you manage to juggle 14 and warframe
[3:51:24] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Play Overwatch? In 2019?
[3:51:25] <+Tyonidus> @Faustgesicht thought that was just a new subspecies but idk
[3:51:26] <RollCritFail> You better hide that baseball bat Pat
[3:51:32] <+LoudButtons> shoulda fought chakotay tbh
[3:51:33] <+Gulping> yeah odo is getting some batshit dragon deviant that is just like
[3:51:35] <Pnutz409> Pat definitely did NOT spend 120 on warframe
[3:51:36] <DJMesoPhunk> ew why would anyone play Overbotch?
[3:51:41] <mr_ESB> Oh hey its shiki
[3:51:42] <%supercasualboom> Damn. Everybody in America has one or two bars...
[3:51:51] <+SleazyShell> speaking of laggy
[3:51:53] <SForlord> @eyedol33 Ah. Thanks. I'm new to the series. Tried World at launch but couldn't get into it. Now I have friends who just started and I'm having a blast.
[3:51:54] <President_valentine> her theme is nice
[3:51:55] <MasterDecoder> @FunkyStreams I mean, he's caught up on the story as far as I know, so he has played it since
[3:51:55] <+LoudButtons> probably get bodied tho
[3:51:57] <+Gulping> spazzing out even harder and shitting nerve gas
[3:52:05] <Kalcom> oh noooo
[3:52:09] <%fFailureatlife> zappy anja is cooler than regular anja

[3:52:23] <mr_ESB> Babby
[3:52:26] <President_valentine> Shiki is best girl
[3:52:27] <+cjthefather> No accessories though
[3:52:29] <deviljhojho94> dont get distracted, boivin tomatoDevious
[3:52:30] <%Faustgesicht> Ah, the coloration made me think of whatever that thing gore did
[3:52:36] <%Faustgesicht> tempering?
[3:52:44] <jubejube56> I just need them to confirm that all armour sets will be craftable as layered
[3:52:45] <+Gulping> gore was rage virus
[3:52:52] <%ssjklyco> does Sam sho still have that free season pass deal?
[3:52:54] <+Gulping> oh a command grab
[3:53:00] <+LoudButtons> Darli is cool and all, but that Shiki super
[3:53:11] <%supercasualboom> @ssjklyco Ended the end of June
[3:53:11] <%fFailureatlife> but darli pierces the heavens
[3:53:20] <%ssjklyco> thanks
[3:53:28] <%goose_attack_almanac> begone....
[3:53:29] <mr_ESB> Shiki BibleThump
[3:53:30] <$ESP_ROOT> good job pat
[3:53:32] <+Gulping> Darli is the best because if you disrespect her
[3:53:33] <IminyourBase> oh no, pat is learning
[3:53:36] <cascadepersona> They can issen through your issen after throw I believe
[3:53:37] <$ESP_ROOT> :)
[3:53:38] <Pnutz409> haha
[3:53:43] <FunkyStreams> @MasterDecoder I recall him calling up paige to buy like over 100 dollars worth of plat and she bet him he wouldn't even be playing it a couple months after the fact. There was a looong period where he was not playing the game afterwards.
[3:53:44] <Kain5707> now i got your power!
[3:53:44] <eyedol33> @SForlord Thats awesome! I never really played till world as well. Playing with friends definitely makes a world of difference.
[3:53:46] <Pacifcgrim> this game looks dope
[3:53:50] <Zombrocom> If they have rage, yeah
[3:53:57] <+LoudButtons> The drill is pretty OD not gonna lie
[3:53:58] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat hey pat remember when you spent all that money on overwatch loot boxes then proceeded to never play it again
[3:54:03] <+Gulping> she can hammer you into stunlock and then say FUCK THAT and then you get punched and die instantly
[3:54:05] <CalderGaming> just have charlotte's moveset left and I'
[3:54:10] <shinlake> Shiki floeOMG
[3:54:10] <%TheStarbecue> Shiki's super on Darli makes me feel the feelings
[3:54:14] <CalderGaming> m done recording all movesets
[3:54:25] <InugamiTheHound> so pat can only win if his opponent uses the most shitty characters in the game??
[3:54:26] <%llamington> holy shit this music?????
[3:54:41] <+LoudButtons> dash up throw, how innovative
[3:54:46] <SForlord> @eyedol33 Makes it a bit easier, too. I decided to go with Insect Glaive, and soloing with that against certain monsters is hard. Getting better at that, too, though.
[3:54:48] <+Gulping> Darli can chump the end boss so hard it's hilarious
[3:55:07] <+LoudButtons> that didn't kill?
[3:55:15] <+LoudButtons> the pushback
[3:55:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Gulping Oh yeah?
[3:55:37] <CalderGaming> what's he trying?
[3:55:39] <+LoudButtons> you have to cancel into it
[3:55:40] <%nanaki_ff14> Go Pat! Beat everyone favorite waifu up!
[3:55:41] <CalderGaming> I looked away
[3:55:41] <%fFailureatlife> LMAO
[3:55:44] <+LoudButtons> from a normal
[3:55:44] <+solzan2000> nice
[3:55:47] <LibriJamm> Yeah, Shiki's theme is pretty good.
[3:55:48] <Pnutz409> jeebuz
[3:55:48] <%Wool> @AngriestPat have you tried microwalking after the throw for WFT
[3:55:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so long 70%
[3:55:49] <+Gulping> Like the moment darli gets her into her first vulnerable state she can just drop weapon and then heavy windup punch until the boss dies
[3:55:49] <Personified134> that damage is revolting
[3:55:51] <TurtleButter> nope.
[3:55:53] <%ArcanumMBD> Have to back throw into WFT
[3:55:55] <MasterDecoder> @FunkyStreams That we know of, he's mostly seems to play it off stream
[3:55:57] <deviljhojho94> nice
[3:56:00] <TurtleButter> every time they do it to themselves kek
[3:56:04] <%supercasualboom> Man, I try to find Pat searching and it shows me nothing. Everyone near me is at one-two bar.
[3:56:09] <+solzan2000> ouch
[3:56:10] <jubejube56> just destroyed
[3:56:11] <muetank> sasslyCheers
[3:56:11] <+Gulping> Heavy Windup Punch is like, death
[3:56:16] <deviljhojho94> Catastrophic
[3:56:20] <CalderGaming> that doesn't work, the frame data doesn't allow it
[3:56:22] <+Gulping> it does super duper damage and has armor

[3:56:32] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat can only WFT after a back throw on jubei
[3:56:35] <+SleazyShell> every time Pat walks it's a microwalk
[3:56:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> there is time to defend, it seems like
[3:56:43] <%wolfofsound> lootwalking
[3:56:43] <FunkyStreams> @MasterDecoder hmmm I wonder if the Paige brain needs a reminder.
[3:56:43] <+LoudButtons> back throw huh

[4:00:21] <MainMan_Jonadiah> There's an overhead button, but no hops
[4:00:21] <+LoudButtons> hmm
[4:00:22] <+solzan2000> there is combo jump
[4:00:23] <%Wool> @AngriestPat I just checked the Jubei Discord channel, backthrow into WFT is a combo.
[4:00:24] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat neutral get up cant be grabbed as quickly as the rolling ones can. saw you go for it so i thought i'd mention it

[4:00:29] <%brickwall35> LUL

[4:00:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Jubei's jump in looks like it has very few active frames

[4:01:25] <+LoudButtons> nice
[4:01:34] <CalderGaming> @loudbuttons they made overhead BC (or MH i guess) in this one, it's a 3rd strike style universal overhead, not really for maneuvering
[4:01:35] <%brickwall35> That was some serious damage
