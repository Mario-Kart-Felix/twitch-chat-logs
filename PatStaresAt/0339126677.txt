[0:19:17] <+freightl0rd> First Pat gets me to reinstall XIV and fall in love with the game, now pat gets me to reinstall warframe. Tho im locked out of the game so maybe god is telling me not to play

[0:19:56] <%Keeble24> some people have actual gone 24hrs without sleep and were fine, but it completely depends on the person i think
[0:19:57] <+LogothX> When you stay up an entire day, you need to make sure you don't need to do anything important
[0:20:02] <%Baesel20xx> yeah I think I remember that
[0:20:05] <+LogothX> but thats common sense
[0:20:06] <%blazymaniac> darn fortuna song gets in my head every time i hear the first few notes

[0:39:24] <+fatkidkilla> critikal is talking about dick pics for subs... how many subs?!
[0:39:24] <Laecerelius> You probably don't want to forma Mesa right now because there's a really good chance that we'll be getting Mesa Prime in December.
[0:39:28] <%FackinCrazy> Is there an auction house

[0:40:06] <+cronx90> @AngriestPat Have you ever played Path of Exile?
[0:40:08] <%Sora20030c> Yeah, farming Plat is way easier and often times faster than farming some mods that have extremely low drop rates
[0:40:08] <$serpenttucker> Unless the relic is super rare and everything on it is amazing, you are almost never gonna sell a relic for anything beyond pennies
[0:40:09] <%Keeble24> thats why i love warframe, you dont really need plat to enjoy it

[0:54:54] <Drasell> illegal Pat
[0:54:55] <%bluetocho13> fuck you I am here....now is the best movie
[0:54:56] <Bouldus> no its far more like TF2
[0:54:57] <+PeaceCentennial> here we go
[0:54:59] <%Archer2150> holy crap I just hit a nerve
[0:55:01] <%Ragnarok_Flames> EYES ON BREEN
[0:55:01] <+PeaceCentennial> pat is going at it
[0:55:01] <gorillahandz> It's funny we're talking about Neil Breen, I just watched The Disaster Artist
[0:55:07] <%BlackJack607> Welp can't get inaros blueprints for 8 days.
[0:55:09] <%ComfortableStranger> cheer200 Clumsiness is a clear indicator of pregnancy, Paige preggo CONFIRMED! But seriously, interviewed for my first salaried job and a hella anxious, please wish me luck 😊
[0:55:10] <Angry_Ev1L> WARFRAME IS F2P FFS not 60$ game
[0:55:11] <$KnivesEve> cool cause my friend is coming with one of the films and he wont tell me which
[0:55:17] <npsmh> hey pat when the dmc2 LP
[0:55:21] <gorillahandz> Good movie. Can't believed I was moved by James Franco acting as Tommy Wiseau
[0:55:22] <+vampireinarm> fuck this guy
[0:55:30] <+joylent_blue> pat should put up a green screen just so he can have a tiger face staring into the camera throughout the stream
[0:55:38] <$RaikenTB> god that's scummy as fuck.
[0:55:42] <Chichen> yes dota as well.
[0:55:45] <%badchoice5> Pat, careful, if you say this outloud then Warframe may turn into Fallout 76 via [Crazy Talk]
[0:55:50] <Skybrid> DE helps people who makes TennoGen with feedback and advice.
[0:55:52] <Bouldus> dota and tf2 i believe do tha same
[0:55:54] <Cobaltor_252> Team Fortress 2 does this as well
[0:55:54] <+waltzqueen> Bethesda is a company full of lazy dicks
[0:55:58] <+vampireinarm> bathestha is fucken garbage
[0:56:03] <+MarshallLee67> in warframe it's 70-30, creator gets 30 iirc
[0:56:04] <Angry_Ev1L> Fuck bethesda
[0:56:05] <+Press_X_ToJASON> i think csgo does this with the cases
[0:56:07] <%Dhrall> They also do a really good job of giving feedback on every piece that doesn't get in
[0:56:10] <Vroom0> They also give feedback to ones that don't make it too :)
[0:56:15] <gorillahandz> Bethesda doesn't wanna work on their games anymore, they just wanna put out a product that JUST BARELY FUNCTIONS and then let the community actually put effort into the games
[0:56:17] <Skybrid> Steam takes a cut too
[0:56:22] <cerberuscarmine> or fallout 76 PAT
[0:56:23] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> What about horse armor, how does that compare?
[0:56:23] <%Zeahk> Steam also gets a cut, If I recall correctly.
[0:56:24] <Zombrocom> There was a story about someone who payed their way through college off their tennogen creations. It;'s nuts, dude was making thousands a month
[0:56:27] <%topendbuzz> OH NO I BREAK MY ASS
[0:56:28] <Worldbrand> Some of those tennogen creators got hired, even. I think a few of them have designed deluxe skins
[0:56:32] <Angry_Ev1L> SKYRIM is still broken on XboneX
[0:56:35] <+waltzqueen> ! ASS BROKEN !
[0:56:36] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat i do that community stuff too for TF2, it's fun and pays well! :)
[0:56:37] <Zombrocom> Yeah yeah
[0:56:40] <%ribboons> I thought Bethesda just wanted to sell more skyrim
[0:56:43] <%topendbuzz> rip skyrim on ps3
[0:56:44] <$Chimeraelite> yep
[0:56:45] <+azraith> Unofficial (INSERT BETHSOFT GAME) patch is always #1 on Nexusmods
[0:56:45] <burkey0307> did you see that giant bomb refused to review fallout 76 because its so bad
[0:56:48] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat hey pat did you see the new netflix trailer "bird box" the movie sounds awesome and has a lovecraftian vibe
[0:56:49] <mongol_800> Hoping Mesa gets more love this time round <3
[0:56:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh boy
[0:56:52] <InsomniacPersona> Its the same as the TF2 Community content that becomes sellable.
[0:56:52] <+dirtsniffurperson> ! MATT ASS BROKEN !
[0:56:55] <$KnivesEve> i never liked bethesda ever since the whole prey 2 fiasco
[0:56:56] <Zombrocom> THe latest deluxe skins were designed by a tennogen artist that DE hired
[0:56:58] <+ived_> lulWut
[0:57:00] <Laecerelius> Repala Syndana for life!
[0:57:01] <%Baesel20xx> @AngriestPat Did you get the sweet syandana that's a bunch of swords strapped to your back?
[0:57:03] <Zombrocom> I think
[0:57:05] <$Chimeraelite> twas a good rant
[0:57:11] <kuronaMermaid> TEPLO SYANDANA
[0:57:14] <Drasell> YES
[0:57:14] <%topendbuzz> who?
[0:57:14] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> oh shoot it's happening
[0:57:17] <%Archer2150> @AngriestPat My good sire I did not mean any offense in the slightest with my contribution
[0:57:17] <al0nem0nster> ...Player made warframe quests would be great, considering how much the warframe animation community slaps.
[0:57:17] <+joylent_blue> uh oh
[0:57:24] <%ComfortableStranger> yeah warfare is f2p but ive spent about 120 bucks on it over 5 years
[0:57:28] <Drasell> Get the Zazu
[0:57:31] <+vampireinarm> oh yeah WTF did you do at RT
[0:57:31] <+ived_> moon2S
[0:57:32] <DevilBirb> Zazumi is the Raven of the Rwby Abrg series
[0:57:32] <witchiamwill> Zazumi is part of rwby ABRG
[0:57:36] <%SiameseSneeze> I love Tennogen stuff, especially my Oberon Blade of the Lotus skin
[0:57:39] <DevilBirb> She is a dear friend
[0:57:43] <DevilBirb> Abridged
[0:57:43] <+sogeki_dan> your own choice @ComfortableStranger
[0:57:44] <Worldbrand> abridged?
[0:57:44] <InsomniacPersona> abridged
[0:57:44] <witchiamwill> Abridged
[0:57:44] <Galacta_Pieta> It shows when bethesda more often than not releases patches that make the game WORSE than actually fixing the bugs and issues
[0:57:47] <+PeaceCentennial> The good thing about Warframe is once you get rolling, you really don't need to spend money on Warframes
[0:57:48] <+Flambage> They didn't even require compatibility with the mods and stuff you bought either. Some mods you could buy were straight up broken @AngriestPat
[0:57:49] <captainthunderwolf> @ComfortableStranger That's the sign of a good FTP, honestly.
[0:57:50] <%GoogleyGareth> @angriestpat I know a guy on a forum that installed every single dlc in the fallout 4 creation club, and there were a ton of conflicts and name bugs.
[0:57:50] <Drasell> RWBY Abridge
[0:57:51] <InsomniacPersona> its the RWBY Abridged VA
[0:57:52] <lucianon96plays> Pat was at RT?????
[0:57:57] <%badchoice5> Actually, if Pat says Fallout 76 isn't the same as Warframe, will [Crazy Talk] make Warframe's model go to shit, or make Fallout 76 rise to Warframe's level
[0:58:07] <Rhinoprotoss> WHO??
[0:58:07] <%ComfortableStranger> @sogeki_dan true
[0:58:08] <DevilBirb> She is losing her freaking mind right now
[0:58:08] <$RaikenTB> a big goofy redhead
[0:58:11] <Caidezes> ??????
[0:58:12] <DevilBirb> XD
[0:58:12] <TheOfficialNeens> aww yeah pat is streaming
[0:58:13] <gorillahandz> wait, Rooster Teeth makes their own RWBY Abridged??
[0:58:18] <gorillahandz> Is that allowed??
[0:58:19] <witchiamwill> Zazumi#5262 is their discord
[0:58:21] <witchiamwill> Just saying

[0:58:52] <$SGrim> @badchoice5 hopefully the second. bethesda doesn't need a win, but I'd hate for Warframe to become a loss on the alter of Pat's stand. WutFace

[1:00:57] <mongol_800> Is that game out? wtf
[1:01:01] <terribleusername> i've seen the helmet flip and that's all i need Kappa

[1:01:10] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[1:01:10] <gorillahandz> Star Citizen is a goddamn scam and a cult
[1:01:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 1m 12s.
[1:01:12] <derap41> NOT AN MMO
[1:01:13] <%imextremelymanly> is the one with the expensive ship
[1:01:14] <fairore> i feel so sad for the people who paid the money
[1:01:14] <+waltzqueen> you can go to night time!
[1:01:15] <Mr_Strut> So was no man's sky
[1:01:16] <+Joey_JoestarXD> 5 dollars

[1:01:33] <zamzoph> ship concepts
[1:01:33] <%D_day> NMS is good now apatDab
[1:01:36] <+ArcLifth> Isn't there a $27,000 one?
[1:01:38] <Zombrocom> It's the one were you pre order new non-exsistant ships for thousands of monies
[1:01:39] <%Enthaarungscreme> I'll wait until Star Citizen is on the Blockchain
[1:01:39] <$RaikenTB> ........
[1:01:43] <+Ell1ot> What?
[1:01:43] <vonmaultke> LUL if only he didn't blow the cash on meeting super stars
[1:01:46] <cerberuscarmine> the game isnt even done
[1:01:47] <gorillahandz> IT'S A S C A M
[1:01:52] <%imextremelymanly> people actually bought those... pity
[1:01:54] <harrfuzz> Don't forget they charged to watch the live stream
[1:01:55] <+MarshallLee67> LUL
[1:01:56] <%topendbuzz> $200 millions and its all gone
[1:01:56] <Mastigias> This is the biggest scam
[1:01:58] <%GoogleyGareth> LUL
[1:01:58] <gorillahandz> I don't get how Dan Gheesling can play dat shit mang
[1:01:59] <cerberuscarmine> and you have to BUY hundreds of dollars worth of "ships"
[1:02:00] <al0nem0nster> =.= wooooooooooooooow paying money for an arbitrarily priced digital object you won't get in a decade. Bitcoin taught them well.
[1:02:00] <burkey0307> ye but itz a real game doe
[1:02:01] <+joylent_blue> LUL
[1:02:01] <alrobot2014> LUL
[1:02:01] <+Joey_JoestarXD> the sad thing is, even if the game is REAL and comes out at some point, it is going to be pay2win so it'll automatically be bad
[1:02:03] <%Archer2150> It sounds like a ponzi scheme
[1:02:07] <%D_day> LUL LUL LUL
[1:02:11] <$KnivesEve> wait THATS THE DEFINITION OF A FUCKING SCAM
[1:02:11] <+azraith> It's the videogame version of a MLM
[1:02:11] <Skybrid> It's just a symbolic thing, I'd say. You're knowingly donating money, unless you're an idiot
[1:02:12] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[1:02:12] <+Uttrik> the marketing department for star citizen is fucking terrible
[1:02:13] <captainthunderwolf> @gorillahandz Do any of us understand Dan?
[1:02:15] <derap41> but check the latest planet landing videos
[1:02:16] <%badchoice5> It's like those apps "for rich people" that cost $1000 and don't do anything
[1:02:17] <%crimsonharvest> I sold my Star Citizen preorder for 5x what I paid so A+ would back again.
[1:02:17] <+joylent_blue> coloring them wrong Kappa
[1:02:19] <%TaifuDragon> I LOVE IT
[1:02:23] <%imextremelymanly> ya but your ass is free
[1:02:23] <%Keeble24> kinda reminds me of that $8000 Donte Jacket
[1:02:24] <+Uttrik> but the tech they're producing is actually pretty cool
[1:02:25] <DatAsuna> Not scam, just stupid management
[1:02:25] <faegbeard> colouring them blue
[1:02:26] <+ShogunNoonto> I love this group
[1:02:29] <$floridianman> it's fun tho
[1:02:29] <DatAsuna> and never gonna finish
[1:02:31] <+TechnicolorNinja> Fashion Frame is endgame pat
[1:02:33] <gorillahandz> @captainthunderwolf the egg does. At least the most out of all of us
[1:02:36] <Huntercd> Saryn is best girl
[1:02:37] <%topendbuzz> oh
[1:02:37] <al0nem0nster> Hey, have people taught him that he can pose and take pictures of his doll with backgrounds yet?
[1:02:37] <burkey0307> you can buy ships in games now in star citizen
[1:02:38] <Skybrid> People deliberately go out of their way to portray it as a scam
[1:02:38] <+Joey_JoestarXD> yikes
[1:02:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva eat the mic
[1:02:43] <Worldbrand> They're trying the hip new pay-to-not-play business model
[1:02:46] <sayaman012341> The first eggnog of the season boiiz 🍻
[1:02:48] <crazyscottnb> not to mentions its hella hard to run the game
[1:02:49] <%topendbuzz> LUL
[1:02:49] <%FackinCrazy> So wait that games not playable?
[1:02:51] <InsomniacPersona> Star citizen IS free... but you do nothing except have a pod to go to missions
[1:02:59] <%Mekhet09> Damn, I just started 14.
[1:03:00] <InsomniacPersona> its shit
[1:03:01] <+dirtsniffurperson> star citizen will use your donations to buy a MANSION FOR HIMSELF
[1:03:08] <al0nem0nster> Like a better Gundam breaker photo taker.
[1:03:09] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @FackinCrazy it's still in 'alpha'
[1:03:11] <Angry_Ev1L> Remember how you wanted to stream 24 hours of 4.0? LUL
[1:03:13] <Bouldus> thats a good clip
[1:03:14] <+InugamiTheHound> I can't wait for Fortuna to hit xb1 soon.
[1:03:16] <%Saggitori> @angriestpat that ship costs as much as my college
[1:03:19] <SomersaultJustice> someone link the clip
[1:03:22] <Rhinoprotoss> Has never been so wrong
[1:03:22] <%GoogleyGareth> hes pretty right
[1:03:23] <+Ell1ot> sometimes you're right
[1:03:23] <Zombrocom> Star citizen is what happens when the dev has no guidelines rules or deadlines, or anysort of supervision whatsoever
[1:03:24] <alrobot2014> its where Crazy Talk took a day off
[1:03:25] <TalisKanju> Crazy wrong and fucking stupid
[1:03:31] <Mr_Strut> Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
[1:03:33] <captainthunderwolf> Star Citizen doesn't smack of a scam to me so much as an obsessive developer pushing a project forever to make his dream game. The creative lead and CEO of Star Citizen tried to make literally this game about a decade ago with older hardware and it had the exact same development problems forever.
[1:03:34] <+masked_hero_lucky> Yeah, you're totally right during that rant
[1:03:35] <+Gruntini> LUL
[1:03:36] <gorillahandz> Armada really fucked the Melee community in the eyes of the common man in that incedant
[1:03:38] <al0nem0nster> hopefully if New Gundam Breaker doesn't kill the franchise we'll get Gundam Breaker MMO.
[1:03:39] <%FackinCrazy> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS oh
[1:03:40] <%AncelDeLambert> ohhh, comments like those are the BEST!
[1:03:41] <$RaikenTB> Pat was actually right about Diablo.
[1:03:42] <%FrostMass22> Pat also nailed the Sony Censorship story
[1:03:42] <%badchoice5> The best part about always swinging for the fences is occasionally hitting home runs
[1:03:49] <%AncelDeLambert> If that comment ever comes in for you, you treasure it
[1:03:50] <heatrashes> pat was right
[1:03:55] <+acejwilliams> i love pat and boy is he fucking smart, but he is fucking wrong
[1:03:56] <+InugamiTheHound> Pat loosing his shit at Woolie about the RE2 zapping system from e3 2018 stream.

[1:04:02] <TalisKanju> Pat also nailed the Game Boy topic on the Podcast
[1:04:06] <%GoogleyGareth> He was listening 8 YEARS AGO
[1:04:06] <Huntercd> Yea Pat is the best
[1:04:08] <harrfuzz> @FrostMass22 Did they say why they started censoring?
[1:04:14] <%badchoice5> He's saying about the Star Citizen store
[1:04:17] <Skybrid> @captainthunderwolf That's the proper way to look at it. Most people just gloss over the surface, assuming too much.
[1:04:21] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat hey pat did you see the new netflix trailer "bird box" the movie sounds awesome and has a lovecraftian vibe
[1:04:27] <+16BitAndUp> That's a good lookin' Pat

[1:08:43] <+joylent_blue> matt has learned nothing over the years
[1:08:44] <+Skatedeandre> These notes are getting cuhrazy
[1:08:54] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat for context, if you were in a public mission as nidus and weren't the host, using his 2 wouldn't pull enemies into a ball, it would instead do the opposite and shove enemies away from where you cast the ability
[1:08:58] <%badchoice5> @PeachSaliva Do you ever look at Pat and think "This is the man who will one day cause my demise"?

[1:37:40] <voyagerwitch> saryn, volt, equinox are all really fun to watch for that reason
[1:37:41] <al0nem0nster> Oh hey Pat, did you ever use the Syringer weapon in Fallout 4?

[1:40:19] <Dorf1> its that pokemon video
[1:40:20] <JaeCryo> @The_Lady_Alustriel It depends on what you enjoy out of an RPG. If you love good combat and fighting giant monsters a la Monster Hunter, it's great. The world is deliberately vanilla and the storytelling feels REALLY archaic, but in a kind of charming way. It's not an easy game but it's a real diamond in the rough once you get past the edges.
[1:40:21] <garagon31> throat
[1:40:21] <ketmakura> It's the gullet/throat in (some?) birds.

[1:51:06] <CertainlySyrix> Everything's about family if you think about it.
[1:51:08] <Logan_Jennings1> @PeachSaliva Darkest Dungeon. Don't get attached, people will die.
[1:51:09] <zangetsu_114> REMEMBER THAT OVERCONFIDENCE IS A SLOW AND INSIDIOUS KILLER.

[1:51:26] <+AmericanaRed> PLAY JOJO
[1:51:28] <mayorrev> ROBOT NARUTO IS AN ACTUAL THING

[1:51:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> >he doesnt know about the ninja mechas
[1:51:41] <ShadowZiggy> In one of the games it did
[1:51:42] <%FrostMass22> Pat is trying to stop Paige from discovering her kekai genkai
[1:51:42] <suikudo> the place that birthed cakes vs muffins war
[1:51:43] <+Diet_z_dan> What about Green Naruto Pat ?
[1:51:43] <voyagerwitch> mecha-naruto
[1:51:44] <Goldenwolf98> IT HAS SO MANY
[1:51:44] <dekkitout> one of the pains is a cyborg
[1:51:45] <Rockgagong> wasnt madara basically a robot
[1:51:45] <Doc1790> IT HAD ROBOTS YOU FOOL
[1:51:46] <mayorrev> I'M GONNA EMAIL WOOLIE TO TELL YOU
[1:51:47] <%Atomik456> Orochimaru made a robot naruto for his own amusement
[1:51:48] <%badchoice5> More puppets than robots, although whats the difference
[1:51:52] <%ribboons> secretly Naruto is actually all about robots
[1:51:52] <%Ranryu692> Naruto totally had robots
[1:51:52] <Nova712> It had Chi powered puppets. That's kinda like a ninja bot XD
[1:51:52] <hntronium> IT SUPER HAD ROBOTS
[1:51:53] <DracaenaLeaf> Remember when Naruto went to the moon'
[1:51:53] <Mersenne> This is robot sao really
[1:51:54] <MSN04_Sazabi> Well Sakura is a robot, or might as well be one
[1:51:54] <+NWR_James> Hunter X Hunter is about the WORST family
[1:51:59] <G_Lancaster> GTA San Andreas is about family. @PeachSaliva

[1:52:18] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat How come toy didn't play the Robit game Matt and Woolie played today?
[1:52:19] <dekkitout> the puppets migh as well be puppets
[1:52:19] <captainthunderwolf> Actually, if Paige played Darkest Dungeon on Radiant Difficulty - the Super Easy mode - she might be able to enjoy it, and that's not an insult, Radiant is for people who don't want a stressful 100-hour campaign and just wanna play.
[1:52:23] <%badchoice5> Who can forget the classic villain, Robo-rochimaru?
[1:52:26] <+dickbuttwoman> It's still literally nothing
[1:52:30] <DraxTD> the amount of Nin-do?
[1:52:33] <Estuko> @AngriestPat using your archwing + the scanner gives you a bird's eye view of highlighted boxes

[2:07:53] <+SuichiTanaka> This makes sense why young Pat got into so many fights
[2:07:55] <Goldenwolf98> Canada super has ghettos yall havent seen shit till you've been to some parts of Vancouver
[2:07:56] <%MagickBurritoh> you could play red dead 2 and hunt turkeys for thanksgiving

[2:08:11] <%Gnapalm> So what youre saying is buy houses in montreal north for the comming gentrification
[2:08:11] <Logan_Jennings1> I live in the country. Got to worry about the coyotes.
[2:08:11] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Yep, I think that's happening to a lot of ghettos in general. My old projects have pretty much a whole slew of rich ass houses surrounding the "urban" areas. FailFish
[2:08:11] <Galacta_Pieta> it's the weirdest where I live cause there used to be fuck all around my entire area including roads now its an almost posh looking Neighborhood all transformed as Ive grown up but the locals are all still bogans and nutcases
[2:08:12] <%topendbuzz> except for that cult
[2:08:14] <+Chud_Pudsley> Canadian farmers are still poor?
[2:08:15] <+Havren13> Farm children might as well be wild animals though
[2:08:17] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat i remember you telling that firebomb story in an LP, their leader was named "Mom" right?
[2:08:21] <al0nem0nster> yeah farm people kill other farm people all the time, because it's hard to find out.

[2:08:29] <faegbeard> back before the finance troubles
[2:08:29] <%badchoice5> Farm poor is "we can't get grandma her medicine cause of the snows", City poor is gunshots and sirens
[2:08:30] <+SirRoyco> That's so wrong Pat, you gotta worry about eating when you're really fucking poor in the city LUL

[2:12:24] <G_Lancaster> Stardew Valley is a "imma put on a podcast and chill" game more than an actual game @AngriestPat
[2:12:25] <%Freelance7> Stardew Valley is great because it's just relaxing.
[2:12:26] <$MightyMaxT> The first time cube episode was the Xavier Woods episode as well
[2:12:26] <ketmakura> @arfsm95 That's the dumbest.
[2:12:26] <%Mekhet09> Do flatearthers hate warframe?
[2:12:27] <CertainlySyrix> Advocate baby murder for summer slam!
[2:12:27] <%badchoice5> Aryan Ressurection

[2:12:50] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you know that in the FAQ of the flat earth assossiation site says that all other planets are proved to be round, only earth is flat
[2:12:53] <dekkitout> pretty sure flat earthers hate no mans sky
[2:12:57] <+NWR_James> @AngriestPat As a flat-earther how does Warframe make you feel?
[2:12:58] <%TaifuDragon> The sentients moved that tree
[2:12:59] <nobleman1992> I love this chat
[2:13:02] <Galacta_Pieta> Has pat gotten his own made/bought k-drive yet or is he still using the jank free one

[2:13:03] <%comb711> was underwater racism FF10 related?
[2:13:04] <%Gnapalm> HOW DID YOU HIT THE ONLY ROCK IN THE DESERT?
[2:13:09] <Jarvanii> who trashed my baby's grave is still the best one
[2:13:15] <gustavozxd> stardew valley is not really like animal crossing, its harvest moon
[2:13:15] <voyagerwitch> how many forma does pat's umbra have?
[2:13:15] <CertainlySyrix> What about the one called "Aryran Resurrection"?

[2:13:56] <+InugamiTheHound> lol
[2:13:57] <+LittleCinders> Crowdfunding the 4th Reich is one of the funniest titles ever..
[2:13:57] <@Fuggins4U> PC Gamer, i think?
[2:13:57] <CertainlySyrix> IT GOT WORSE
[2:13:58] <nobleman1992> and we all know the moon landing was fake and directed by Stanley Kubrick
[2:13:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[2:13:59] <%MagickBurritoh> Best strategy, RUN AWAY

[2:14:43] <mayorrev> so congrats
[2:14:45] <%FrostMass22> "Just give Crowdfunding the Fourth Reich a chance!"
[2:14:48] <+dickbuttwoman> You should entitle a podcast "PC Magazine can go suck my dick"
[2:14:48] <Worldbrand> We all know Miracle Girls Festival is the clear winner
[2:14:50] <captainthunderwolf> You tryna tell me the Best Friends, of all the LP groups out there, sabotaged long-term possibilities for jokes in the moment?

[2:26:13] <CertainlySyrix> I'm racking my brain trying to figure out what song this is
[2:26:21] <mayorrev> that song sounds super familiar

[2:30:48] <%TaifuDragon> why do I always tune back in from concentrating on a mission, to hear some heinous bullshit come out of either you or paige's mouth
[2:30:49] <+dickbuttwoman> But he was not farm poor
[2:30:52] <%TaifuDragon> Every single time
[2:30:54] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat it's hibernating for the winter
[2:30:55] <%Piemen99> It's protecting the young
[2:30:58] <+LittleCinders> When Pat hits the back.. of HIMSELF
[2:30:59] <%Hilleltaco> It's like a loaded pilebunker, ready to fire outwards violently
[2:31:05] <+WhyIDie> I did my part!
[2:31:07] <Worldbrand> It has the Fight Club problem
[2:31:08] <+NickyDynamite> It's like when the guyver suit goes back in
[2:31:12] <nnif> it's about as pro war as WH40K
[2:31:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> """"Journalists"""""
[2:31:16] <Goldenwolf98> PRO WAR? are they dumb
[2:31:20] <Coystick> Critics have always been autists
[2:31:24] <dekkitout> nuance, nuance never changes
[2:31:29] <%badchoice5> It's like Machiavelli's The Prince
[2:31:35] <al0nem0nster> let's not pretend obvious points don't often sail over people's heads.
[2:31:35] <Crankthulhu> @AngriestPat Do you know that the book Starship Troopers is war propaganda, making the movie doubly funny?
[2:31:36] <%Fedgle> My cousin still doesn't believe starship troopers is satire and unironically likes the message
[2:31:37] <DatAsuna> GOD FUCK THOSE PEOPLE
[2:31:40] <DatAsuna> I KNOW O MANY OF THEM
[2:31:41] <+LogothX> Man if Warframe had Guyver tie in I'd spend 200 dollars on it right away
[2:31:45] <Clammy_chan> never trust anyone who says fight club is their favorite movie
[2:31:55] <%ribboons> I have seen neither of these movies
[2:31:59] <Crankthulhu> TAMEEM THINKS DURDEN IS COOL
[2:32:01] <%whistlehunter> Man I remember showing my buddy Starship Troopers and he wanted me to keep replaying the shower scene so he could jack it, was creepy as fuck and we're not friends anymore
[2:32:03] <dekkitout> theyre not fools, just maybe sociopathic
[2:32:04] <bear_breaker20> Who takes starship troopers seriously tho?
[2:32:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fooooolish!
[2:32:07] <$MightyMaxT> I have a hard time recognizing satire until people point it out to me
[2:32:07] <%Kirijuo> There are people I know that don't believe Fight Club is satire
[2:32:11] <%Hilleltaco> "Man Scott Pilgrim is a cool guy"
[2:32:13] <london_flexing> All writers I know use subtext. Their all cowards
[2:32:16] <$MightyMaxT> I just can't grasp it unfortunately
[2:32:18] <Goldenwolf98> wait 5?
[2:32:18] <ArtThouBored> Fight club has a great soundtrack
[2:32:20] <+babyacid> Litterally a breakdown of Toxic masculinity written by a gay guy
[2:32:21] <%spacekataz18> Yeah
[2:32:21] <MSN04_Sazabi> There are two ways to be wrong about Starship Troopers: thinking that it's fascist propoganda, or thinking that the regime in that movie is super cool and our society should be more like it
[2:32:21] <%MrBorisMakarov> 5???
[2:32:22] <LixFury> theirs more then 3?
[2:32:22] <%Baesel20xx> and a cartoon show
[2:32:23] <+Chud_Pudsley> @AngriestPat And they're all animes
[2:32:24] <cerberuscarmine> all terrible
[2:32:24] <+InugamiTheHound> didn't Ninja Theory based DMC dante after tyler durden?
[2:32:25] <al0nem0nster> what
[2:32:27] <TotallyAHacker> and it got a bad rip off called enders game
[2:32:27] <lemon_lore> there more then 1
[2:32:27] <Logan_Jennings1> THEY'RE ALL BAD
[2:32:28] <Kaitepaints> @whistlehunter cool story bro..
[2:32:28] <+megaotter> Fight Club is a fantastic movie but yes, definitely a satire
[2:32:31] <%SiameseSneeze> Not worth mentioning
[2:32:32] <Angry_Ev1L> CG sequels
[2:32:33] <%whistlehunter> 2 live action 2 cg
[2:32:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> C O W A R D S
[2:32:36] <cerberuscarmine> the first one is the best
[2:32:37] <faegbeard> Tyler Durden is the rolemodel for dumb people who want to think they're sociopaths for cool poitns
[2:32:38] <%chiluzza> You can read the book faster then watching all the movies
[2:32:41] <%spacekataz18> Remember the time Starship Troopers went big hard on Christians to the point the mechs had cross guns?
[2:32:42] <whittacre> 3 movies, 2 cg and the TV show
[2:32:42] <cerberuscarmine> the rest SUCK ASS
[2:32:43] <al0nem0nster> 5 sequels, well that's a time waster acquired
[2:32:43] <DatAsuna> @AngriestPat id you know the starship troopers movie was a middle finger to the author?
[2:32:50] <%whistlehunter> @Kaitepaints thank
[2:32:50] <+TheDeadpoolDash> There was also a CG animated series at one point
[2:32:51] <+dickbuttwoman> You know, you could have just did survival on uranus and gotten like 10 of those
[2:32:54] <+LogothX> Is there a Starship Troopers OAV
[2:33:02] <+LogothX> Starship Troopers Mangaverse
[2:33:02] <Kaitepaints> being a dick bag is the new ass hole
[2:33:03] <CertainlySyrix> I thought he was 26 for some reason
[2:33:04] <%SiameseSneeze> @AngriestPat , do you know where to find Tellurium?
[2:33:04] <InsomniacPersona> Tellerium? I dont even Kowerium!
[2:33:06] <Worldbrand> Yeah those drop on Uranus survival
[2:33:06] <DatAsuna> The people taking it seriously are just as much a cunt as the original writer was
[2:33:14] <al0nem0nster> @spacekataz18 So you're telling me it almost became Warhammer 40k.
[2:33:19] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat did you know Starship Troopers had an incredibly shitty and short lived CGI animated SERIES?!
[2:33:28] <Goldenwolf98> when is archwing not going to be shit to play?
[2:33:29] <ArtThouBored> Sadly Joker is the new tyler durden
[2:33:30] <DatAsuna> the movie is more them making it anti war and anti facist to fuck with him
[2:33:34] <+InugamiTheHound> okay I have leave this stream and go to bed. Its 1:34am

[2:33:57] <%CEGold> @InugamiTheHound Take it easy dude!
[2:33:57] <InsomniacPersona> Have you seen anything on Titans Pat? its super dumb
[2:33:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> b o n e l e s s
[2:33:59] <+LittleCinders> Wasn't every single Starship sequel just a campy mess that didn't work because they tried to be serious, or they tried to be campy and didn't nail the satire?
[2:34:01] <ArtThouBored> I miss when he was just an evil clown
[2:34:06] <Clammy_chan> do warframes have bones?
[2:34:07] <+dickbuttwoman> Amesha is the actual best archwing

[2:35:57] <+megaotter> Fight Club is a legitimate satire of consumerist culture, imo. But also is a satire of the culture of masculinity. I think it's the 2nd part that people miss a lot..

[2:39:02] <Worldbrand> Now let's see if pat already had a mirage systems bp
[2:39:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Chichen <3 <3 <3
[2:39:09] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat shouldnt have to build receiver.
[2:39:10] <%SiameseSneeze> You don't
[2:39:13] <CertainlySyrix> You don't build it, it's a weapon part.
[2:39:13] <+dickbuttwoman> The weapon parts are just usable
[2:39:13] <%THATGUY_789> da purple boyz
[2:39:13] <Mersenne> You don't build weapon parts
[2:39:14] <faegbeard> you already have the receiver
[2:39:15] <%Everpresent_Overseer> tht one you don't
[2:39:16] <dekkitout> you only build prime frame parts
[2:39:16] <SunsetJack> Lex Prime receiver can be given.
[2:39:19] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat receiver is a part, not bp
[2:39:20] <+Uttrik> warframe parts need to be built, weapon stuff comes already built
[2:39:21] <modmanawesome69> @CEGold YOu SUCCEED!
[2:39:27] <mongol_800> Pat you built Paracesis yet?

[2:40:04] <%around_40_jobbers> PARGON PARGON PARGON
[2:40:04] <Huntercd> Argon is super cheap though
[2:40:04] <mongol_800> i have 13 Argons now but nothing to use it for LUL
[2:40:05] <+Ell1ot> @AngriestPat are you still looking for the Ivara Neuroptics? I have an extra one
[2:40:06] <CeeDee__> And then they Were-gone
[2:40:07] <+gutlesscoward> geez that's an old one
[2:40:11] <%Mekhet09> Wow that's an old call back.
[2:40:12] <%HRDSalami654> Argon's easy though.
[2:40:14] <TerraWraith> XELETAOTH ULIOTH MANTERBOCK PARGONPARGONPARGON
[2:40:15] <+dickbuttwoman> Do it nightmare you coward
[2:40:15] <Goldenwolf98> People say Oxium is the worst no fuck you Argons tho
[2:40:17] <%MrBorisMakarov> nightmare DansGame
[2:40:21] <+MisterrBlack> !uptime
[2:40:21] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 40m 23s.
[2:40:22] <+WhyIDie> that amount of plat on screen has to be the work of an insanity effect
[2:40:22] <nepwar> oh cool stream is still going
[2:40:25] <%CEGold> @Chichen Don't mention it! doodBro
[2:40:27] <+megaotter> HE SAAAAID THE THIING PogChamp
[2:40:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat you are 40 years old
[2:40:27] <+SuichiTanaka> you can get argon whenever you want
[2:40:28] <Commandercreedy> Nice purple scarf bro
[2:40:28] <dekkitout> even when i farm an assload of argon, i still somehow am in a drought
[2:40:33] <SunsetJack> oxium is worst
[2:40:34] <%around_40_jobbers> argon takes 3 minutes to get
[2:40:38] <Skybrid> Pat used to have hair but now it's Argon
[2:40:39] <+dickbuttwoman> Oxium is the worst if you're solo-dojo-ing like I am
[2:40:40] <ArtThouBored> Chatturgha is best boy
[2:40:42] <%MagickBurritoh> argon is artificially rare
[2:40:44] <SunsetJack> You need a lot to build alert prime...
[2:40:46] <%mister___doctor> You see what I'm saying? Perfect. Drop your shield
[2:40:47] <al0nem0nster> the worst used to be Vauban parts.
[2:40:48] <+babyacid> but its muuuuuuuuuuuuuch easier to farm
[2:40:49] <+Ell1ot> my argon crystals... are gone!
[2:40:53] <+Uttrik> cryotic is the worst for me, excavations are so fucking boring
[2:40:54] <faegbeard> only argon can sustain me
[2:40:56] <ArtThouBored> Xelotath a slut
[2:40:59] <DrDomVonDoom> I got my mastery rank 1 what does this even mean
[2:41:02] <DrDomVonDoom> I’m so lost
[2:41:13] <Goldenwolf98> I know but I play enough that I get plenty of shit stored up so I dont really run out but then theres Argon
[2:41:14] <%SiameseSneeze> Spent so much Cryotic on that piece of shit Sibear, now I'm just constantly broke
[2:41:14] <+WhyIDie> until the sibear is built, cryotic is the worst
[2:41:15] <ArtThouBored> Jellyfish a shit too
[2:41:17] <SunsetJack> Enough to make the weapon that costs 30k cryotic...?
[2:41:17] <fmc009> orokin cells tho
[2:41:17] <faegbeard> means you got one big boy level
[2:41:19] <%spacekataz18> Worst is when you eventually build Voobin Prime
[2:41:19] <dekkitout> throw on nekros and grab a beer, cause is nothing but defense missions for the next hour
[2:41:22] <+dickbuttwoman> I had to grind about 130k of the stuff for dojo
[2:41:25] <Skybrid> I put dissolved Argon into my veins
[2:41:25] <CertainlySyrix> right now getting higher mastery means you can use more weapons @DrDomVonDoom
[2:41:28] <%spacekataz18> Voobin is horrible on mats
[2:41:29] <%NeonTurnip> argon and its gone
[2:41:31] <%Mekhet09> You can oxium grind with nekros
[2:41:37] <%Mekhet09> It's pretty easy.
[2:41:38] <Mersenne> as little spoilers as possible while he plays excal umbra
[2:41:46] <%THATGUY_789> the argon
[2:41:48] <faegbeard> it are gone
[2:41:48] <%johnny_gogo> @AngriestPat how do you begin to get into warframe
[2:41:54] <projecthazoid> I still need to kill an eidolon
[2:41:59] <Goldenwolf98> GRINDING
[2:42:00] <+dickbuttwoman> Start the game
[2:42:00] <CertainlySyrix> You create an account and play it.
[2:42:04] <%ribboons> I find the defense missions give the best amount of Argon. Once got 7 in one go
[2:42:06] <Goldenwolf98> thats how you begin
[2:42:06] <KaliasTV> Now allies trap you in mission for 80 minutes
[2:42:07] <+WhyIDie> you hit your head against the brick wall until it starts to make sense
[2:42:08] <%THATGUY_789> the argon the argon the baby
[2:42:10] <%Mekhet09> Also I just started FF14 but what kind of ungodly things do I need to get my own house?
[2:42:13] <%FrostMass22> Remember that time Pat didn't know how to boil water?
[2:42:17] <nepwar> dont forget to use pats refferal code
[2:42:20] <al0nem0nster> I still can't believe the Orokin were able to master faster than light travel but couldn't stop argon decay.
[2:42:35] <dekkitout> and dont expect the game to tell you what to do all that much
[2:42:38] <faegbeard> my warframe is strong
[2:42:42] <fmc009> big dick honor
[2:42:44] <+gralho> that was a spoiler tough
[2:42:50] <+gralho> the spacebaby spoke
[2:42:50] <Skybrid> @al0nem0nster You realize what it takes to keep argon in crystal form?
[2:42:52] <+SuichiTanaka> Pat's referral code is down below.
[2:42:57] <Goldenwolf98> Oh super wont tell you shit
[2:42:58] <+Uttrik> AKA, play the game with the wiki open
[2:42:59] <%whistlehunter> wE fOUghT wITh hoNOr
[2:43:01] <%ribboons> its only a poiler if you say its a spoiler
[2:43:02] <Angry_Ev1L> @Mekhet09 LoL housing in ff14 is wooof
[2:43:04] <%chiluzza> so its basically space ninja PoE
[2:43:10] <CertainlySyrix> bookmark the wikia page for warframe
[2:43:10] <%SiameseSneeze> The warframe wiki is your friend
[2:43:12] <+gralho> oh dam
[2:43:14] <%chiluzza> cept DONT USE THE STEAM POE PATCHING IT IS A FUCK
[2:43:18] <%Mekhet09> I figured it was bad.
[2:43:19] <LixFury> best way to learn warframe is to find soneone to teach you warframe]
[2:43:21] <dekkitout> step 1: download warframe, step 2: bookmark r/warframe or some forum/wiki
[2:43:23] <Clinnamon> join an established clan too, there's a lot of stuff locked into clan research
[2:43:33] <+dickbuttwoman> Yes please
[2:43:35] <CertainlySyrix> THANK YOU
[2:43:35] <Goldenwolf98> I play Warframe with a friend whos a founder I get all my info from him cause this game tells you NOTHING LUL
[2:43:39] <Ultimatefool> LUL
[2:43:50] <al0nem0nster> @Skybrid haven't read the lore on it, just collect it, what does it take?
[2:43:54] <faegbeard> isn't the SPFZ full as dicks
[2:43:57] <CertainlySyrix> I thought you had to be subbed in order to join your WF clan? @AngriestPat
[2:43:59] <+Chud_Pudsley> I gave up on this game when they introduced Junctions.
[2:44:04] <MechaMoonCat> Are the ps4 and pc version of this cross play?
[2:44:07] <+SuichiTanaka> When I went to go join the clan the first time, I saw that they only wanted experienced players
[2:44:08] <%badchoice5> Fuck you Pat you can't stop me
[2:44:10] <%SiameseSneeze> no Mecha
[2:44:14] <Cendov> FeelsBadMan
[2:44:15] <mongol_800> Is it only for cool kids?
[2:44:16] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I wish you could join multiple clans in warframe
[2:44:19] <Skybrid> @al0nem0nster Argon is an actual element from the periodic table.
[2:44:19] <+RushUnplugged> you see a cool thing in game, you wiki it, and if you can you farm it, if not you keep playing to access the maps needed
[2:44:20] <%ribboons> the best way to learn how to play warframe is to get the game and keep killing things till your a shiny space flaming space doll with far too many guns and shiny things than anyone ever
[2:44:23] <+WhyIDie> tbf, it's 2018, and multiplayer-focused games can make due with the community helping each other learn the game
[2:44:26] <%TaifuDragon> It's super fucking full as it is
[2:44:33] <%badchoice5> Wait, I can make Pat leave his own clan by joining a free game?
[2:44:34] <SirSmudgey> what happened with the free company?
[2:44:37] <faegbeard> If Pat really wanted to grind he's solo clan like a big boy
[2:44:39] <al0nem0nster> @Skybrid yeah, and the actual noble gas doesn't decay either.
[2:44:39] <nepwar> but the how can i stalk you?

[2:46:30] <Worldbrand> If you farm up the tokens you'll have a massive head start for prime access
[2:46:31] <+Chud_Pudsley> @Gnapalm EDF FC is a FFVXIV guild
[2:46:31] <Skybrid> @Nephthyz And a husband
[2:46:33] <dekkitout> so the poison water
[2:46:34] <+dickbuttwoman> The other 3 syndicates are probably better. Less people seem to play them.
[2:46:34] <al0nem0nster> @Skybrid Yes, so a space fridge. My point being they already broke physics with faster than life travel, I'm surprised they don't have the super fridge.
[2:46:35] <nepwar> is pat playing on controller?
[2:46:40] <+Nephthyz> @Skybrid Both forms are canon female.
[2:46:41] <+WhyIDie> @SiameseSneeze people usually give them out, especially if you ask if they can toss it in as extra for some random trade
[2:46:42] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat What if it's good tho?
[2:46:43] <CertainlySyrix> Yes. @nepwar

[2:47:25] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[2:47:26] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat if you want I can trade you back! didn't know you had it
[2:47:27] <anon_1307> LUL
[2:47:28] <Skybrid> @al0nem0nster Well, it remains solid within Orokin Towers, but once you take it from there, it basically starts to melt
[2:47:28] <T_Sasquatch> they got sponsored by DC FOR TITANS LUL
[2:47:32] <ArtThouBored> I'm not even gonna play anthem and i liked Andromeda
[2:47:32] <+chrisp1200> LUL
[2:47:35] <KaliasTV> You have a spare to actually build one some time
[2:47:38] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat do syndicate missions I do them everyday when I log in they are super quick if you just do the captures, sabotages and exterminates
[2:47:38] <%Mekhet09> Haha.
[2:47:40] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat you gonna take this fucking sicarus prime or what?
[2:47:42] <Angry_Ev1L> @dekkitout probably poor man's destiny
[2:47:43] <DatAsuna> @T_Sasquatch and fallout 76
[2:47:45] <anon_1307> Rush it
[2:47:54] <+Cybercobra2> you dont need to build the lex part
[2:47:54] <KaliasTV> Weapon parts are already built
[2:47:56] <CertainlySyrix> Marvel's INHUMANS
[2:47:57] <faegbeard> you already have the receive you don't build it
[2:47:58] <%Chichen> At least you still need it for Mirage Prime. I was going "oh no what have i done"
[2:47:59] <%SiameseSneeze> Andromeda had great combat... story and characters were... sub par...
[2:48:01] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat receiver is prebuilt
[2:48:02] <Skybrid> @Angry_Ev1L Warframe is Anthem ripoff
[2:48:10] <%SiameseSneeze> PAT YOU DON'T BUILD WEAPON PARTS
[2:48:14] <DrDomVonDoom> Why is everything in this game horrific looking it’s like if Guillermo del Toro made Star Wars lol
[2:48:15] <DatAsuna> andromeda had great exploration
[2:48:18] <+Nephthyz> All weapon parts are pre built.
[2:48:21] <dekkitout> pro; i can paint a javelin like unit-01, con; i like the division more Kappa
[2:48:21] <CertainlySyrix> you should know this by now
[2:48:22] <%Mekhet09> Lex prime sucks.
[2:48:22] <Cendov> no its not
[2:48:23] <$yeknomlive> just started building my chroma prime. is frost still his best build?
[2:48:26] <ArtThouBored> Hey gay turian spectre was cool
[2:48:28] <Skybrid> Weapon parts don't have to be built, you get them as is
[2:48:31] <al0nem0nster> @Skybrid by the same logic infested material should rot or propogate.
[2:48:33] <+Nephthyz> @AngriestPat why is it blue

[2:48:47] <+Cybercobra2> bluuud
[2:48:49] <nepwar> bluuuud
[2:48:50] <mayorrev> have a good night everyone
[2:48:50] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat it ONLY shows when you take damage. You can also color the blood... Color it white chicheEggstra
[2:48:51] <Clinnamon> it appears as you get damaged
[2:48:51] <CertainlySyrix> @AngriestPat It only turns on if you get hurt.
[2:48:52] <$MightyMaxT> ehh bluhhh
[2:48:52] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> So you can say "What is that smell" all day
[2:48:53] <mayorrev> 👋
[2:48:54] <%ribboons> that's just a bluuud
[2:48:54] <+Nephthyz> Don't get that, the sigil only shows when you're taking damage.
[2:48:55] <anon_1307> edgy
[2:48:56] <Estuko> I think that's fucking cool
[2:49:00] <%Gnapalm> gn rev
[2:49:04] <%around_40_jobbers> @AngriestPat get the blood sigil but make it gold, trust me
[2:49:06] <Angry_Ev1L> @Skybrid I don;t even hate idea of anthem lol But I swore to NEVER buy any EA game after ME3
[2:49:11] <Estuko> @Nephthyz oh only during damage? awe.
[2:49:14] <DrDomVonDoom> Why do space ninjas need a scarf?
[2:49:16] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat goodnight pat
[2:49:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEY ANIME
[2:49:18] <faegbeard> pretty clipping
[2:49:18] <DatAsuna> ME3 had a great MP
[2:49:20] <Estuko> Fashion Frame is end game
[2:49:21] <%Gnapalm> BECOME BLOOD
[2:49:25] <%ribboons> looks like a gundum
[2:49:27] <dekkitout> scarfs give +80 to coolness
[2:49:27] <DatAsuna> The expansions made it way better
[2:49:30] <al0nem0nster> @DrDomVonDoom It's cold out in space.
[2:49:31] <Goldenwolf98> WHY DO REGULAR NINJAS NEED ONE?!
[2:49:32] <zamzoph> Why does it look so BLUE?
[2:49:33] <+WhyIDie> scarf all the things
[2:49:34] <%Wallabri> space is cold
[2:49:34] <izaich> ITS NOT A SCARF
[2:49:35] <+Nephthyz> Reminder that Umbra is technically Chinese.
[2:49:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> a n i m e
[2:49:37] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Estuko it's real neat. You have to do some thins to get it to show up which fits Garuda mostly
[2:49:38] <cx_c2> D:
[2:49:40] <Angry_Ev1L> Great lootboxinfested full priced game MP LUL
[2:49:41] <mongol_800> Wish you can color the scarf separate
[2:49:41] <izaich> ITS A SYANDANA
[2:49:42] <DatAsuna> ME3 is also like the only lootbox system with no dupes
[2:49:43] <Skybrid> @al0nem0nster Infestation is barely explained, so we can only speculate about "logic" there. As far as propagation goes - it consumes everything it can reach, so yeah.
[2:49:44] <%MagickBurritoh> Fashion is the strongest weapon
[2:49:45] <CeeDee__> if the deadly space ninja wants to wear a scarf, I'm going to let it
[2:49:50] <%Beough> @AngriestPat goodnight pat, enjoy the rest of your stream, im tired as fuck
[2:49:51] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat I was saying Garuda sigil shows only when you take damage
[2:49:52] <%ribboons> scarves natural make you a protagnist
[2:49:53] <%Chichen> thats all
[2:49:55] <cerberuscarmine> SMALL
[2:49:58] <ArtThouBored> Salarian infiltrator was my jam

[2:49:59] <%THATGUY_789> @angriestpat and his guyver
[2:50:01] <$MightyMaxT> The only EA games I think I got were Dead Space and Dragon Age Inquisition
[2:50:05] <talfurt> Space ninjas neck get cold
[2:50:05] <DatAsuna> only upgrades then it makes your drop rate for everything else higher
[2:50:06] <DrDomVonDoom> If Greninja has a scarf 8 guess he can have one too
[2:50:11] <Skybrid> Umbra = Dead Cell Guy?
[2:50:14] <ArtThouBored> And krogan soldier
[2:50:16] <%Chichen> burn it all down

[3:06:30] <%MagickBurritoh> @AngriestPat use archwing to find the shiny areas
[3:06:30] <KayThree> this is exactly the reason that people started using dynamite for this
[3:06:33] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat If you want some help fishing I can bring an Ivara so you can stand above the water. Just take your game off solo and put it on friends only
[3:06:34] <al0nem0nster> guess there are no fish there at the moment
[3:06:34] <bleugh> phobos pebis
[3:06:36] <+dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat You need bait from The Biz. Broad-spectrum bait for Echowinders

[3:07:21] <CalderGaming> @AngriestPat holding the spear in the aim stance triggers fish to start spawning so you have to wait. different fish spawn at different temperatures
[3:07:24] <KaliasTV> Stand at the edge and hold right click
[3:07:25] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat its jank as fuck. Sometimes throw again or further in.
[3:07:26] <Twoiis> no lure?
[3:07:27] <CeeDee__> There's a nice pond southwest of the Reflector Control
[3:07:30] <Skybrid> Keep your spear out and keep waiting
[3:07:31] <+dickbuttwoman> Hold the map button to see the time
[3:07:32] <+Nephthyz> Fish are always around, there's different fish during cold, freezing and warm weather.
[3:07:35] <KayThree> pls wait until the horse's pepis has unshrunk from the cold
[3:07:35] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat invite me from the clan tab and ill help you fish jesus
[3:07:38] <Scrub_Seeker> @AngriestPat try a different spot, you're fishing in an awkward spot
[3:07:43] <Skybrid> There's always fish, but it's different depending on temperature @AngriestPat
[3:07:45] <+SWindleFeD> Why the shit is the ice moving?!
[3:07:45] <KaliasTV> You'll hear bubbles when they start spawning
[3:07:49] <Zombrocom> This advice is terrible.

[3:09:14] <CalderGaming> these are the only kind of fish you can catch in lakes at this temperature without special bait
[3:09:15] <ArtThouBored> The only good fishing is in Deadly premonition.
[3:09:15] <%Baesel20xx> yo mods I have a good link for fishing and everything, who can I dm it to to get it to pat (assuming he wants it)
[3:09:16] <@Mechz71> I thought Pat was catching Zapdaddies
[3:09:16] <+dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat Hold the map button to see the time
[3:09:17] <al0nem0nster> huh...if only this game were more indepth with it's physics, Mag would be ultra useful in fishing here.

[3:15:33] <sodium_station> when did this game become horizon zero dawn
[3:15:34] <nepwar> when i think space ninjas i didn't think fishing with your space ninjas buddy would be part of the experience
[3:15:42] <Skybrid> Fishing for robotic fish in a lake of coolant is not weird, RIGHT
[3:15:55] <PeteyMcPickle> what is this ungodly hour

[3:17:16] <+Nephthyz> What a shitty deliveryman.
[3:17:17] <Skybrid> @Uttrik I've mined tons of rarest gems expecting to use them for this! I can use it for Operator costume pieces now
[3:17:17] <+keksisblyat> feelsbadman
[3:17:17] <Angry_Ev1L> AHAHAHHA LUL how can this happen EVERY TIME?
[3:17:17] <thebehatted> do you want a firm handshake?
[3:17:18] <dekkitout> worst part of living in an apartment sometimes...
[3:17:21] <%ribboons> now he'll starve D:
[3:17:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat needs a huggy bobo kissy wissy
[3:17:26] <nepwar> i bet the delivery guy fucked up the food and just said ahh fuck it
[3:17:28] <Angry_Ev1L> SUE THEM
[3:17:33] <%SiameseSneeze> moon2PH
[3:17:35] <+Nephthyz> SUE THEM
[3:17:36] <+keksisblyat> so what do they just keep your money and you get no food?
[3:17:40] <+chrisp1200> We looked at the door, saw steps and left.
[3:17:41] <+Chud_Pudsley> Yep
[3:17:44] <Skybrid> Well, you could always cook some robofish @AngriestPat
[3:17:45] <@Mechz71> apatBig cry
[3:17:47] <%AncelDeLambert> But Pat doesn't LIVE in an apartment anymore! He has a HOUSE! RING THE DOORBELL!!!
[3:17:48] <%badchoice5> At least this time Pat's food wasn't stolen by a trusted loved one
[3:17:51] <Angry_Ev1L> what kind of shitty service is this
[3:17:55] <+keksisblyat> WOW
[3:17:55] <%spacekataz18> How this keep happening
[3:17:57] <+Nephthyz> So basically they steal your money, fuck them.
[3:17:57] <TheBigO75> Cook your own dang food
[3:17:57] <+Chud_Pudsley> Go kill him
[3:17:58] <%Mekhet09> Time to refund.
[3:17:59] <nepwar> was this uber eats?
[3:18:04] <+Chud_Pudsley> Hunt him down and murder him and eat him
[3:18:04] <Coffee_JD> Just call the place and complain?
[3:18:05] <suikudo> fuck that noise
[3:18:08] <dirtyjustice> Delivery guy was just hungry so he ate it and said he couldn't deliver BibleThump
[3:18:09] <%Mekhet09> And sent a complain.
[3:18:11] <Estuko> Kill him
[3:18:20] <dekkitout> well then, whos ready for a good ol fashioned riot
[3:18:20] <%Gnapalm> Sue
[3:18:21] <%MagickBurritoh> HUNT HIM AND EAT HIS STOMACH TO GET YOUR FOOD
[3:18:24] <Goldenwolf98> this is why I dotn trust these food delivery services
[3:18:25] <suikudo> get your fucking phone and go raise hell bitch zoneRage
[3:18:25] <%Gnapalm> litigation
[3:18:25] <+Uttrik> @Skybrid yeah, or just for rep, the new mining system generates so many rare gems and they're 1k rep a pop, you can cap daily faction rep so much faster with fortuna
[3:18:27] <sodium_station> calling the place does nothing if it's a third party that's delivering the food
[3:18:28] <Angry_Ev1L> Do you have driver info? Fuck him put. THIS IS BULLSHIT
[3:18:30] <@Mechz71> @TheBigO75 This person is saying the correct thing
[3:18:31] <%Gnapalm> Class action
[3:18:32] <+Press_X_ToJASON> @TheBigO75 money can be exchanged for goods and services
[3:18:35] <Melman9812> i had that happen to me once and they raised the delivery price
[3:18:43] <nepwar> good thing youre stock full of delicious delicious mustard
[3:18:47] <modmanawesome69> I just went and got myself food, did i miss something?
[3:18:58] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat aim high with the spear to account for drop over distance
[3:18:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> diliver guys are dirtbags in my experience
[3:19:02] <Skybrid> @Uttrik Got bonds and more common gems for trhat... Besides, new amps and Operator stuff might require them
[3:19:02] <hntronium> You missed pat missing his food
[3:19:03] <nepwar> call it and stream your anger
[3:19:03] <Estuko> text him and tell him to get his bitch ass back here
[3:19:03] <Goldenwolf98> I'll order a goddamn pizza if Im desperate fuck those services
[3:19:03] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat FUCK HIM UP
[3:19:17] <%Mekhet09> Can't you right them up?
[3:19:18] <RekknLIVE> unhappy costumer still going back for more = junkie
[3:19:22] <$rdark_ksu> make him regret his birth
[3:19:28] <faegbeard> "i'm live on the internet dumbass you didn't even try"
[3:19:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> GIVE OUT HIS NUMBER
[3:19:29] <Skybrid> FIST HIM WITH A BURGER
[3:19:46] <+chrisp1200> Send him a "U up?" text
[3:19:58] <%Gnapalm> Now you have to stream all night so you can go get a big breakfast in the morning
[3:20:00] <KayThree> I just finished War Within, I wasn't expecting intrigue in my dumb space ninja robot game
[3:20:04] <Janglebelly> does no one do conclaves? im trying to farm that sweet faction rep
[3:20:12] <+dickbuttwoman> @AngriestPat It hits slightly below the reticle. Try aiming slightly above what you wanna hit.
[3:20:16] <%Baesel20xx> conclaves are wasteland
[3:20:21] <%MagickBurritoh> @Janglebelly nope
[3:20:24] <Skybrid> @KayThree It's my favorite quest in the game
[3:20:28] <Goldenwolf98> @Janglebelly conclave was dead when it came out
[3:20:34] <dekkitout> conclave is battleborn in warframe
[3:20:35] <+dickbuttwoman> It's cold now
[3:20:42] <+keksisblyat> Space ninjas fishing for robo fish in lakes of coolant is weird
[3:20:44] <Skybrid> COLD
[3:20:47] <%spacekataz18> You most likely got what you needed though
[3:20:49] <Janglebelly> i mean yeah it sucks gameplay wise but i need that rep...
[3:20:50] <%MagickBurritoh> in a cooperative multiplayer game PVP doesn't do well
[3:20:51] <%badchoice5> Aim first with your heart Pat, then with your mind, and only THEN with your eyes
[3:20:51] <dirtyjustice> You think conclave is barren try getting into a lunaro game
[3:21:05] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat btw the cold to warm timer is 22 minutes cold, 4 minutes warm.
[3:21:18] <%SiameseSneeze> Warframe PVP LUL
[3:21:23] <Skybrid> @MagickBurritoh In Dirtstiny it's plenty popular. Can be in Warframe too, especially since it's so unique and cool.
[3:21:30] <+RushUnplugged> never seen something more dead on arrival than lunaro
[3:21:31] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I didn't even know there was a difference in the nae
[3:21:31] <faegbeard> the k-drive is an odd choice because it's like one quarter the speed of my Volt
[3:21:34] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat so you taking that break now?
[3:21:36] <Worldbrand> Hopefully we'll be able to make use of the area of the map called Reflector Control later on
[3:21:39] <anon_1307> go play lunaro
[3:21:41] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I thought Lunaro was also just called Conclave sometimes
[3:21:47] <Bouldus> baby scream?
[3:21:47] <%Chichen> Elmo is mad about food not being here apatPorgmo
[3:21:51] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Since the delivery fuckup what is your favorite "fuck it" frozen food
[3:21:55] <+sourceofall> they don't want to melt all the ice, duh
[3:21:57] <Goldenwolf98> Like I said earlier Warframe has everything in it only half of it is playable LUL
[3:22:02] <+dickbuttwoman> Anyone in here maxed out on rep on one of the right three factions and interested in trading weapons?
[3:22:05] <Skybrid> @MagickBurritoh Devs separated PvP from PvE, making it harder for people to get into it, while avoiding many issues Bungievision has to deal with
[3:22:06] <dekkitout> emlo demands his blood offering again is all
[3:22:18] <+mikesniderman> go to sleep pat
[3:22:21] <%Baesel20xx> correct
[3:22:26] <%Chichen> ye
[3:22:26] <%Baesel20xx> yes
[3:22:26] <+dickbuttwoman> Yes
[3:22:28] <CalderGaming> yes
[3:22:30] <%spacekataz18> Hey Pat have you gone varmint hunting?
[3:22:31] <%SiameseSneeze> yes
[3:22:33] <Skybrid> Yep
[3:22:33] <%Gnapalm> Make a healthy pasta
[3:22:45] <%Baesel20xx> imo dismantle all of them, technically you can turn them in for faction but I dont think its worth it when you can turn in gemstones
[3:22:46] <+dickbuttwoman> Provide = Rep, Dismantle = Parts
[3:23:01] <Melman9812> i gotta go to bed night Pat and Paige and happy thanksgiving
[3:23:07] <%MagickBurritoh> Ticker is the best
[3:23:09] <Ace_Kuper> This probably was asked at the start of the stream, but did Pat remove all past broadcasts because of the new Twitch policy?
[3:23:19] <GodlyLuigi> watch your credits you gonna be poor soon lol
[3:23:22] <%MagickBurritoh> in fortuna
[3:23:28] <G_Lancaster> ye @Ace_Kuper
[3:23:29] <sodium_station> So are their organic heads just floating around in a jar somewhere?
[3:23:41] <dirtyjustice> Pffft credits are easy to get though....just farm the index
[3:23:41] <GodlyLuigi> @sodium_station spoilers
[3:23:41] <Silverbee> Whats the new policy?
[3:23:42] <+Debuggingfool> whats the new twitch policy?
[3:23:46] <%Baesel20xx> Ticker is great, but mining is a close second, its super easy with the new mining gun
[3:23:48] <Graywolf_the_45th> wut hapun
[3:23:48] <sodium_station> ah ok
[3:23:49] <Skybrid> @sodium_station You're in for a surprise. Reaching max rank with this faction answers this question
[3:23:50] <Cendov> What's the new twitch policy?
[3:23:52] <dekkitout> no music
[3:23:56] <GodlyLuigi> @dirtyjustice pat doesnt like doing index
[3:24:01] <DracaenaLeaf> Youtube was a better place to watch old episodesanyway
[3:24:04] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat HOW CAN THIS BEEEEEEEEE
[3:24:05] <+Javaa01> Save your credits so you won't be broke as hell when you try to get into the Index next time around
[3:24:11] <%MagickBurritoh> DID YOU NOT LEARN YOUR LESSON
[3:24:12] <Goldenwolf98> Twitch trying to keep up with Youtubes dumb shit LUL

[3:24:45] <%badchoice5> "Oh don't worry sir, we took care of that for you. See, now we refunded the food you didn't get!" -System that's missing the point
[3:24:47] <%SiameseSneeze> good, I have to pee

[3:39:20] <%supersugoisenpai1> my cat Squirrel doesn't know how to meow right and just squeeks
[3:39:26] <%ribboons> tiny pigs are the best pigs
[3:39:30] <$rdark_ksu> pigs also get big. "tea cups" are just babies
[3:39:37] <%THATGUY_789> so bought Coke No Sugar Orange.......yeah not really tasting the ORANGE here
[3:39:43] <+Ell1ot> and when you stop loving it, just eat it and you'll love it again
[3:39:55] <%SiameseSneeze> I had a fuckin' bug last night where I called my archwing, except, I didn't get in the archwing, I just stayed on the ground... until I tried to jump. I started slowly floating upwards, it was like using a goddamn no clip console command
[3:39:58] <%Baesel20xx> but Pat, Paige already has a pig apatDab
[3:39:59] <nepwar> we have four outside cats that decided to hang around our place because its big and they wont stop rubbing against my leg everytime im outside
[3:39:59] <$rdark_ksu> no
[3:40:06] <TheShadowWolfen> no... pat you must remember... manbearpig... he is super cerial
[3:40:19] <$rdark_ksu> the Smallest pig you could get will get to at liest 25kg or 50 lb minimum
[3:40:19] <+keksisblyat> STOP PUTTING CLOTHES ON ANIMALS PAT
[3:40:22] <%ribboons> are there pigmy pigs?
[3:40:23] <+Ell1ot> no. tea cup pigs were made up to sell pigs to idiots
[3:40:25] <%FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat I still want my fucking house hippo god dammit
[3:40:30] <$MightyMaxT> Aren't those a special breed? Teacup pigs?
[3:40:35] <%MagickBurritoh> 5 fucking thermal sludge!?
[3:40:38] <Worldbrand> yeah please dont starve pigs
[3:40:50] <nepwar> aww so cute
[3:40:51] <+Nephthyz> You're an animal, stop putting clothes on yourself Pat.
[3:40:56] <Scrub_Seeker> @AngriestPat has woolie shown any interest in playing warframe for the channel again?
[3:40:57] <Estuko> @TheShadowWolfen not even Satan can stop him
[3:40:58] <%topendbuzz> dogs needs coats in cold places
[3:41:20] <%MagickBurritoh> Airbud
[3:41:26] <TheShadowWolfen> i mean... what size is it? smol dog means bigger colds right
[3:41:28] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat have you set the ping limit multiplayer setting?
[3:41:36] <%Chichen> Make him.
[3:41:41] <+NWR_James> "Micro pigs" grow to be about the size of a mid-sized dog. Like 60 - 80 lbs
[3:41:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat Miniature Kune Kune Pigs are a thing.
[3:41:44] <+Nephthyz> Beat him to death until he plays it again
[3:42:15] <%SiameseSneeze> Playing Volt to make up for being a poopy host
[3:42:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> they cute
[3:42:41] <+keksisblyat> @AngriestPat When you gonna play fighting games again, the few streams you did were fun
[3:42:45] <TheBigO75> why is everyone dying around pat?
[3:42:45] <+Nephthyz> Volt has a massive nose.
[3:42:46] <%FackinCrazy> My friend fed his micro pig waht he thought was bulk pig food when it was actually bulking food for making them fat so you can eat them and it got huge
[3:42:50] <nepwar> i like the sonic memes of volt
[3:42:57] <Worldbrand> while considerably tiny for a pig, adults still reach 60-200kg
[3:42:59] <ObsidionRob647> Is this one for the switch?
[3:43:02] <dekkitout> not as massive as tengu zephyr
[3:43:06] <dirtyjustice> 3k credits....what a crappy reward
[3:43:09] <%SiameseSneeze> I want to see Pat play Soul Calibur, except he plays as either Paige or himself
[3:43:10] <$MightyMaxT> I chose Volt as my starter because Electric powers rule
[3:43:12] <Graywolf_the_45th> gift woolie an atlas so he can do the punchies
[3:43:33] <captainthunderwolf> Man, that Umbra looks cool. I think most of the frames are a few ounces overdesigned, but with the vermillion scarf and the gold accents, it's so over the top that it comes back around.
[3:43:37] <%Fedgle> atlas is poopy
[3:43:51] <%MagickBurritoh> Atlus has ball shoulders
[3:43:51] <%SiameseSneeze> Atlas is pretty cool, barely play him though. Plus, I just hated the Jordas Golem shit
[3:43:52] <TheShadowWolfen> @angriestpat can we appriciate the fact that desu desu doki doki said kune kune... like if he said pig pig woulda just sealed it
[3:43:56] <cerberuscarmine> do it pat
[3:43:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> funny tho
[3:43:59] <Bouldus> @AngriestPat have you tried battletech, its a turn based game in the mechwarrior universe
[3:44:00] <nepwar> punches and only using counters as intended
[3:44:00] <%MagickBurritoh> boulder shoulders
[3:44:03] <DraxTD> well now it HAS to be done!
[3:44:05] <CassidyAlacrity> That was me. I wonder if my group was mad.
[3:44:07] <Worldbrand> no i'm an ice mage
[3:44:10] <dekkitout> is the newly revealed frame a punchi boi too?
[3:44:11] <TheBigO75> Woolie HATES efficiency
[3:44:13] <%TaifuDragon> He's an ice mage
[3:44:13] <mongol_800> Are you guys ever gonna go back to Mon Hun Pat?
[3:44:16] <G_Lancaster> like the billy thing
[3:44:22] <%MagickBurritoh> you can parry in Warframe
[3:44:24] <+tussletoes> Atlas is best frame.
[3:44:27] <%HRDSalami654> so you're saying he should do it then.
[3:44:29] <%ribboons> I think its a stab girl?
[3:44:30] <%MagickBurritoh> there's a mod for it
[3:44:31] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat what about a guinea pig? they are basicaly fat rats and look good in hats
[3:44:35] <+keksisblyat> So is your food actually coming this time Pat
[3:44:37] <%Divryne> It's a John Wick.
[3:44:38] <%Harawanagangsta> Im 90hours into the game and I dont think ive shot a single enemy with a gun.
[3:44:38] <%SiameseSneeze> They compared the new frame to John Wick if you can believe that LUL
[3:44:41] <floatRand> I haven't played Warframe since it was a corridor shooter - back when Primes weren't a thing. I had that Ash frame and punchy gloves, which was really fun to go around with, especially using the *teleports behind you* special.
[3:44:42] <DraxTD> @TheBigO75 Woolie likes to ruin Tetris and all games with PATTERN LOGIC!
[3:44:42] <+Nephthyz> Its design is very bland, just looks like the Volt proto-skin.
[3:44:42] <dekkitout> no, the *new one
[3:44:43] <%Divryne> John Wick frame.
[3:44:50] <hntronium> Guinea Pigs eat their young
[3:44:52] <TheShadowWolfen> it has the name pig tho
[3:44:53] <Worldbrand> Baruuk is basically a monkframe? They did compare him to john wick, yeah
[3:44:55] <Cendov> Did you guys know there exists a parry wity melee weapons in warframe?
[3:44:57] <$SirTerribleh> Guinea pigs are rats
[3:44:58] <%ribboons> what about bunnies?
[3:45:02] <nepwar> what about a chinchilla
[3:45:03] <Cendov> with*
[3:45:05] <%SiameseSneeze> Honestly, I'm just excited to see how the fuck the new frame will work
[3:45:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> they are kinda cute
[3:45:09] <dekkitout> reluctant hero frame were the exact words, i believe
[3:45:16] <floatRand> The name was Furax I think.
[3:45:16] <$SirTerribleh> How about a Hedgehog?
[3:45:20] <TheShadowWolfen> ferrits? im all for ferrits
[3:45:23] <SiegeJay> Dumb question: How do I deal more damage so I can actually kill things on Neptune
[3:45:27] <%Chichen> Im making pasta chicheEggstra apatDab
[3:45:27] <Max_Capacity> !uptime
[3:45:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 45m 29s.
[3:45:35] <$rdark_ksu> oooh get a ferret. they are crazy cat like weirdos made out of fur and a slinkey
[3:45:38] <dirtyjustice> @SiegeJay equip better mods
[3:45:38] <Worldbrand> I caught a spider so this is the perfect time for a break

[3:45:49] <%MagickBurritoh> @SiegeJay use better mods or better weapons
[3:45:58] <%Voidwyvern> Pat almost defeated Max's Replay data
[3:46:09] <%ribboons> In my one comp class the teacher had us write an essay about chinchillas and dust baths.
[3:46:16] <TheBigO75> @SiegeJay Farm credits and endo until you can upgrade your damage mods
[3:46:21] <%SiameseSneeze> Mirages' 1 ability moon2L
[3:46:25] <TheShadowWolfen> max is maximum all deh time eh?
[3:46:27] <%MagickBurritoh> mirage has boobs on one of her helmets
[3:46:27] <captainthunderwolf> nl_Kripp earned his 12K viewers last night, played fucking Magic: The Gathering, Artifact, and Hearthstone on the same screen at the same time.
[3:46:31] <captainthunderwolf> That shit was dumb.
[3:46:36] <Crankthulhu> Wayyy too costly
[3:46:38] <+keksisblyat> Why is Excaliber just press 4 and spam melee
[3:46:39] <+Chud_Pudsley> DE is poor AF
[3:46:44] <%SiameseSneeze> but yeah, all kidding aside, Mirage is pretty great
[3:46:59] <cerberuscarmine> stalker!
[3:47:01] <SiegeJay> How do you even farm endo to the level that you can upgrade damage mods at the higher levels?
[3:47:04] <dekkitout> because exacliber is excaliber
[3:47:07] <%SolitudeOtM> I mean, DE is still technically an idie dev right?
[3:47:08] <anon_1307> is not fortnite pat
[3:47:09] <%MagickBurritoh> to be a rich man you have to hoard pennies
[3:47:13] <%SolitudeOtM> *idie
[3:47:17] <Caidezes> DE isn't poor. lmao
[3:47:18] <TheShadowWolfen> warframe hise a hard entry wall tho
[3:47:20] <%SolitudeOtM> *Indie
[3:47:21] <%HRDSalami654> They can barely sustain their chat servers.
[3:47:22] <+Chud_Pudsley> @MagickBurritoh And Pepis
[3:47:26] <TheShadowWolfen> has
[3:47:27] <captainthunderwolf> I feel like Warframe is a game where the dev team is either doing well, or about to fiscally collapse, at any point in time.
[3:47:32] <%SiameseSneeze> I hoard Ayatan Sculptures, do sorties, or the new Arbitrations for Endo
[3:47:33] <%SolitudeOtM> my n key is broken appartly
[3:47:33] <Worldbrand> @SolitudeOtM No, they're owned by a chinese publisher that used to be a food company. The name escapes me
[3:47:36] <captainthunderwolf> And they have very little chance to predict where they'll be and when.
[3:47:37] <+Ell1ot> it could be stalker or some jackasses
[3:47:43] <+NWR_James> DE should pay to show the Pepis for servers
[3:47:44] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @SolitudeOtM with over 200 employees?
[3:47:45] <%SolitudeOtM> Ah
[3:47:57] <+RushUnplugged> I wouldn't call DE poor but there's a big difference between having login/matchmaking servers right now, and full match hosting ones
[3:47:58] <%MagickBurritoh> it's not the red flicker so it's a faction
[3:48:01] <+CyberTheory> where is my body horror I was promised?
[3:48:07] <TheShadowWolfen> all muder all the time
[3:48:14] <captainthunderwolf> @CyberTheory Thanksgiving is tomorrow.
[3:48:17] <Worldbrand> The parent company is Leyou and they bought DE in 2016.
[3:48:26] <%ribboons> whats this about body horror?
[3:48:37] <%SiameseSneeze> Over 1 Million registered loser- I mean, users - Rebecca Ford
[3:48:42] <%MagickBurritoh> Nova's ability
[3:48:42] <Cendov> Tigris is stupid
[3:48:48] <cerberuscarmine> tigris is the best
[3:48:51] <+keksisblyat> @AngriestPat Do you think Lady and Trish will be playable in DMC 5? Hope so, especially if its multiplayer
[3:48:54] <dirtyjustice> Isn't Leyou that chicken company?
[3:48:55] <dekkitout> because the big ghetty star, thats how
[3:48:58] <Cendov> almost
[3:49:00] <nepwar> almost
[3:49:01] <+Javaa01> Absolutely
[3:49:01] <TheShadowWolfen> good ole double barrel
[3:49:02] <+RushUnplugged> by mistake but yes she did
[3:49:02] <%SiameseSneeze> She ALMOST did LUL
[3:49:02] <%FullofTar> Take your shirts off and look in the mirror. Body horror achieved.
[3:49:03] <%Divryne> YES.
[3:49:04] <anon_1307> yeah
[3:49:04] <cerberuscarmine> almost
[3:49:05] <%MagickBurritoh> what
[3:49:06] <+Bupkis7> pretty much
[3:49:06] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat "Over 20 million registered los- I MEAN USERS"
[3:49:08] <Cendov> it was hilarious
[3:49:09] <%Divryne> ALMOST AT THE GAME AWARDS.
[3:49:09] <KaliasTV> She was thinking it
[3:49:09] <+Thatghostpepper> at an old game awads
[3:49:10] <Worldbrand> No, she said "over 26 million registered losers"
[3:49:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> At the game awards as well
[3:49:12] <Estuko> She was HALFWAY THROUGH THE LOSER PART THERE
[3:49:16] <nepwar> she should have committed tho
[3:49:17] <$SirTerribleh> Who?
[3:49:18] <%MagickBurritoh> HAH
[3:49:19] <+Ell1ot> Pat, I found a Hydroid Prime in my foundry. How do i Hydroid?
[3:49:20] <$rdark_ksu> pat have you ever experienced an american thanksgiving?
[3:49:24] <cerberuscarmine> its a running joke now lol
[3:49:24] <%HRDSalami654> Leyou owns shares of DE but they are not the parent company.
[3:49:26] <TheBigO75> Literaly who
[3:49:27] <Clinnamon> is she wrong tho
[3:49:30] <+RushUnplugged> that's why we love spacemom
[3:49:32] <Caidezes> Space Mom hates us.
[3:49:32] <+dickbuttwoman> I am a registered loser
[3:49:33] <anon_1307> we forgave her tho
[3:49:34] <KayThree> who is this?
[3:49:43] <cerberuscarmine> umbra
[3:49:43] <Scarletguardian22> space mom
[3:49:49] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat have you set a ping limit for your multiplayer settings?
[3:49:57] <anon_1307> community manager
[3:49:59] <Worldbrand> In 2015 they bought the share, in 2016 they bought the company, according to wiki
[3:50:00] <+Chud_Pudsley> 26 Million Registered Losers - WarFrame Memes. Look that up
[3:50:02] <TheBigO75> Oh the weird chick
[3:50:08] <captainthunderwolf> Man, Warframe's combat inevitably hits the point where it looks like an ME3 multiplayer match having a stroke.
[3:50:09] <%MagickBurritoh> ping limit doesn't always work though
[3:50:12] <dekkitout> the more you know 🌈
[3:50:19] <GodlyLuigi> better than nothing
[3:50:24] <%MagickBurritoh> yeah
[3:50:26] <%PenmanLupine> did she lose her phone?
[3:50:32] <$MightyMaxT> Is it next to her Keys?
[3:50:38] <TheShadowWolfen> @angriestpat how would you reccomend people get into warframe?
[3:50:43] <Bouldus> night Paige
[3:50:47] <DracaenaLeaf> What's the status on pat's food I wonder
[3:50:54] <GodlyLuigi> oh god that skewered naked cat looks awful
[3:51:02] <dirtyjustice> 404 Food not found
[3:51:03] <captainthunderwolf> @TheShadowWolfen He would say to skip straight to the Chimera Ant arc.

[3:52:21] <%idyota> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[3:52:26] <+Cobalt_Racer> stuuuuug
[3:52:29] <captainthunderwolf> Oh wow, that scarf's way bluer in this lighting. That customization menu is fucking cursed, dude.
[3:52:30] <%SiameseSneeze> The wiki is fan made IIRC
[3:52:31] <%SolitudeOtM> Just bought DS3 on pc, now I own it on all platforms...
[3:52:36] <dirtyjustice> Spin to win

[3:52:45] <%SiameseSneeze> Still, the fan made wiki is super helpful
[3:52:46] <Graywolf_the_45th> Weaker food men have less rare drops
[3:52:47] <floatRand> How is Furax these days?
[3:52:51] <+SuichiTanaka> Stug is a good boy.
[3:52:58] <Worldbrand> It is no longer the king of charge attacks
[3:53:06] <%ribboons> now we go to the food souls?
[3:53:06] <%SiameseSneeze> I refuse to use Maiming Strike... also, I don't have it
[3:53:08] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> hey pat, sup
[3:53:08] <$SirTerribleh> Do you even see sunlight anymore?
[3:53:11] <Crankthulhu> Hey Logang
[3:53:14] <anon_1307> finally now I can go and play
[3:53:18] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat thanks for sharing.
[3:53:20] <MrPedrovsky> @angriestpat Thanks For keeping me company with my very first MonHun (world)
[3:53:23] <%SiameseSneeze> always
[3:53:26] <sqaurebet> WITCH
[3:53:26] <Coystick> UNF
[3:53:27] <%SiameseSneeze> oh damn
[3:53:28] <+Chud_Pudsley> Kaboom
[3:53:29] <cerberuscarmine> AAAAAAAAAAAA
[3:53:31] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat why do you not bother to pop some basic mods on your weapons?
[3:53:31] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> oh that's really awesome
[3:53:32] <TheShadowWolfen> why does atterax look like someone asked if they could make a cainsaw mace hybrid?
[3:53:33] <nepwar> WHAT IS THIS MAGIC
[3:53:33] <%SolitudeOtM> I've only seen like 2 hours of sunlight this week
[3:53:33] <+dickbuttwoman> Night y'all
[3:53:33] <cerberuscarmine> too scary!
[3:53:35] <+Ell1ot> How do i mod Hydroid Prime? i just finished building him.
[3:53:40] <%ribboons> what wizrardry is this?!
[3:53:40] <%SiameseSneeze> later dickbuttwoman
[3:53:40] <SiegeJay> I stopped playing Warframe because I need warframe slots, farming Endo looks impossible if I have to do the time trials for endo relics, I need more weapon slots.
[3:53:41] <nnif> very cool
[3:53:42] <nepwar> i though october was over
[3:53:42] <Graywolf_the_45th> how he do dat
[3:53:43] <dekkitout> oh thank god, i thought he meant his thunder dong
[3:53:51] <captainthunderwolf> @Crankthulhu If you really wanted to force a community name for Pat's watchers, the "Boivang" would actually be alright.
[3:53:53] <floatRand> A Kind of Magic?
[3:53:54] <+SuichiTanaka> Hydroid wants lots of range
[3:54:01] <Coystick> Shin Vordt
[3:54:05] <+SuichiTanaka> git yo tents erreywhere
[3:54:07] <+Chud_Pudsley> But why 3. The worst of the series. You're better off playing bloodborne honestly.
[3:54:11] <%FackinCrazy> You just beat cathedral of the deep
[3:54:11] <TheShadowWolfen> oh god its worse
[3:54:13] <%SiameseSneeze> *Hentai Frame
[3:54:16] <hntronium> Warfram Soulz 3
[3:54:17] <DracaenaLeaf> When was the last time you played Dark Souls III?
[3:54:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> comf souls 3
[3:54:27] <KayThree> Hek w/ Scattered Justice or Vaykor Hek -- which do you prefer?
[3:54:28] <%SolitudeOtM> 3 is the beest gameplay wise
[3:54:29] <DracaenaLeaf> III worse than 2 now? whoa
[3:54:32] <DraxTD> welp I got to go to bed, I have to cook food tomarow
[3:54:34] <nepwar> i thought 2 was considered the worse
[3:54:35] <Bouldus> the most recent DS game is always the "worst"
[3:54:37] <+Ell1ot> range for hydroid. is there an augment i should get for him?
[3:54:38] <%FrostMass22> 1 is the best but 3 is good
[3:54:39] <nepwar> at leas vanilla 2
[3:54:40] <%DedlokPM> Pat want to bring out Dark Souls to LIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT! z8z3
[3:54:41] <KayThree> Deciding which way to go and if pursuing Meridian rep is worth
[3:54:43] <%ribboons> its bloodbornes and darksouls's rabid child
[3:54:44] <Caidezes> Dark Souls 3 is the most consistent of the games.
[3:54:44] <%SolitudeOtM> but Bloodborne is the best
[3:54:44] <$SirTerribleh> 3 was worse than 2? You're crazy
[3:54:46] <captainthunderwolf> Every single Dark Souls has been going downhill since Bloodborne.
[3:54:49] <+RushUnplugged> how does it even feel to be THAT wrong and think ds3 is bad
[3:54:50] <%SiameseSneeze> Definitely Pilfering Swarm Ell1ot
[3:54:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> comfy stream starts now
[3:54:53] <Worldbrand> what on fuck? I'd still call 2 the worst
[3:54:54] <enoughmold> I thought people said 2 was the worst?
[3:54:57] <DracaenaLeaf> Wouldn't that be Dark souls remastered then?
[3:54:59] <+keksisblyat> DS3 has the most equally distributed good game out of all of them
[3:55:00] <Bouldus> its jsut the train everyone jumps on
[3:55:02] <MartwyPies> I feel like every Dark Souls game has an equvielant fans who think every other game is thrash
[3:55:02] <dekkitout> so its the same as the fallout rule
[3:55:03] <+SuichiTanaka> You'll wanna pick up Pilfering Swarm for good farming later
[3:55:04] <%SiameseSneeze> unless you don't give a shit about loot/health/energy drops
[3:55:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i like all the dark souls games
[3:55:07] <Bouldus> ds3 is my favourite
[3:55:09] <%FackinCrazy> Its just a bit too linear
[3:55:12] <%Mekhet09> It feels boring.
[3:55:14] <TheShadowWolfen> @angriestpat when i first came to stream, i though that steve busemmi picture was oage chilling, thats how clueless i was
[3:55:15] <KayThree> Why do we have to call any of them 'worst' - they're all great and have unique strengths
[3:55:18] <%spacekataz18> ds3 is fun but the combat feels weird
[3:55:19] <Bouldus> @dekkitout yea
[3:55:20] <Coystick> DaS3 is excellent
[3:55:21] <%topendbuzz> so is ds1 on the switch the worst
[3:55:34] <%Mekhet09> I couldn't go through it more than once and I tried.
[3:55:34] <cerberuscarmine> LOL
[3:55:37] <Bouldus> waow
[3:55:37] <sqaurebet> LUL
[3:55:39] <+NWR_James> woooow
[3:55:41] <nepwar> yeah that makes sense.
[3:55:45] <floatRand> I still haven't played Ds3 despite having huge boner for Ds1 and Ds2. I bought it on launch but found out my computer was too old to run it. I have better computer now, but can't be arsed for some reason.
[3:55:46] <%ribboons> whats everyone's fav boss from the bludsouls series
[3:55:51] <RichAnvils> DaS has the best world, DaS3 has the best combat, DaS2 exists
[3:55:51] <+Chud_Pudsley> Its just walked back a lot of nice changes 2 made, and then it incorporated abunch of stuff from Bloodborne, particularly the spastic enemies, while keeping the player relatively sedentary in their actions
[3:55:53] <TheShadowWolfen> im on my phone to be fair
[3:55:56] <SeventyForce> BECOME STEVE
[3:55:58] <cerberuscarmine> dancer is best girl
[3:56:01] <RichAnvils> DaS2 has the best DLC
[3:56:03] <KayThree> DaS2 has best pvp, ppl can fight me on that one
[3:56:04] <dekkitout> lady maria of the astral shark week
[3:56:07] <TerraWraith> I often find myself being like, "Man, I want to play Dark Souls 2." Then I start it, get to Huntsman's Copse, and am like, "...Naah, nevermind."
[3:56:10] <Worldbrand> Well we don't *need* to compare them, but if we're going to, then obviously one will be considered worse
[3:56:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gay
[3:56:10] <Bouldus> @RichAnvils ds2 has my favourite control scheme
[3:56:11] <DracaenaLeaf> can't you just like walk up to her
[3:56:16] <%Baesel20xx> GROSS

[3:57:28] <%FackinCrazy> Lesbian food?
[3:57:34] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat why do you not bother to put basic mods on weapons when you go to level them?
[3:57:40] <dirtyjustice> @Ell1ot yay
[3:57:41] <Bouldus> but yea, a lot of the DS community will jsut on the train of the newest one being the worst, i personally think they all have plus' and munis' to them
[3:57:44] <Crankthulhu> Neither, get the Corinth
[3:57:45] <%Gnapalm> pat i just wanna say u cute but also ty for destroying yourself so us Aussies can watch while we eat dinner
[3:57:45] <%SiameseSneeze> I honestly prefer Vaykor Hek, though a lot of people debate over that shit
[3:57:45] <Bouldus> minus*
[3:57:48] <%spacekataz18> 8 shots versus 4 too
[3:57:49] <TheShadowWolfen> hey, page & pats relationship is as sound as a peice of steel in salt water; seems cool even if its long destroyed
[3:57:58] <+Aleate> I am laying on my side in bed, and my cat came and laid down across my torso, and I was stuck for like 10 minutes because he was purring and adorable
[3:58:02] <+sourceofall> scattered justice is basically included in the vaykor heks base stats
[3:58:03] <%ribboons> I always think of Veh Hek whenever I hear the words hek
[3:58:04] <constar90> Return of Lucky Ted? :O
[3:58:05] <$MightyMaxT> How long do you wear clothes before saying its dirty? For me its pants and sweatshirts for 4 days, everything else is one time use
[3:58:16] <%spacekataz18> It's a cool ass fun, a lot of the shotguns are fun as fuck
[3:58:20] <%Acecfa44t> turned 21 a week ago, enjoying it so far
[3:58:22] <+drethstoff> @AngriestPat how many shots does mother have?
[3:58:23] <%SiameseSneeze> @AngriestPat , I can gift you one
[3:58:25] <nepwar> have you played fist of the north star game? @AngriestPat thoughts on it if you have?
[3:58:28] <KayThree> Tigris Prime is obscene but you get sick of the 2 shots nonsense
[3:58:30] <%spacekataz18> Arca Plasmor, Corinth, Heks, Kohm all fun
[3:58:30] <Crankthulhu> Tigris Prime is legitimately broken, but only has two rounds, fired twice
[3:58:31] <+SuichiTanaka> Vaykor Hek is utility that is good for most situations. Justice Hek is "I want this dead, NOW."?
[3:58:32] <constar90> !uptime
[3:58:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 58m 34s.
[3:58:34] <+RushUnplugged> tigris prime is the damage monster, but vaykor hek is the best when leveling new frames
[3:58:36] <%SolitudeOtM> @AngriestPat Have you played Lost in Vivo? It's the newest game by the creator of Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion. It'san fps that's heavily inspired by Silent Hill, it's pretty cool.
[3:58:45] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @AngriestPat You should always check Invasions for Strun Wraith parts. 100% status shotgun with a ton of apatBig stats and goodness
[3:58:47] <%SiameseSneeze> If you say so
[3:58:48] <dekkitout> if your tigris prime isnt atomizing something with one pellet, then that tigris prime needs a new homw
[3:58:54] <KayThree> Aite aite i hear yall, thanks guys
[3:58:56] <Angry_Ev1L> @Are you planning on buying RTX cards? Or will you wait until actual not meme GPUs like a smart person?
[3:58:59] <TheShadowWolfen> like... which vile, the dank op, or like quickscopers on cod?
[3:59:00] <KayThree> Gonna keep on that Steel Meridian grind
[3:59:00] <Crankthulhu> @SolitudeOtM Oh shit, Spooky made Lost in Vivo?! I did not know that
[3:59:02] <%spacekataz18> I'm gon play that it sounds great
[3:59:06] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat Also sorry for the confusion last night, I was saying that Excal isn't at the end of the star chart anymore, not that he isn't good (he's my preference too)
[3:59:11] <%SolitudeOtM> It's pretty spooky
[3:59:11] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Tigris Prime sucks to shoot though
[3:59:16] <Worldbrand> The answer with math and on-paper DPS is that vaykor hek wins out if you have primed ravage
[3:59:16] <DracaenaLeaf> Food or paige
[3:59:20] <MartwyPies> what's your interest in playing KH3
[3:59:27] <+Chud_Pudsley> RTX cards are complete scam, for 200% the price
[3:59:28] <nepwar> also no RTX compatible games out yet
[3:59:33] <%SiameseSneeze> PogChamp

[3:59:40] <+keksisblyat> @AngriestPat How do i send you a thing on twitter, i made a tweet where I @ed you but i dont think thats the same thing
[3:59:40] <nepwar> HE MUST BE STRONG
[3:59:41] <%spacekataz18> I hope he don't freeze god dang
[3:59:41] <dekkitout> mumen rider? holtzPOG

[3:59:46] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Jesus wtf. How cold is it in MTL? It's like -17 in Toronto
[3:59:47] <Clinnamon> more dedicated than the last guy
[3:59:48] <Worldbrand> Isnt it like -20º out there?!
[3:59:48] <Bouldus> he gonan trhow his bike at you
[3:59:51] <%spacekataz18> HEK IS GREAT
[3:59:51] <%SergeEXE> HESA BIKEY MAN
[3:59:58] <+SuichiTanaka> Get Hek, rek
[3:59:58] <%MagickBurritoh> BICYCLE.... BICYCLE
[4:00:00] <%SergeEXE> FROM A BIKEY GANG
[4:00:04] <%spacekataz18> I've played since the open beta and Hek is still my top gun
[4:00:08] <101shadesofwonderful> Is he from a bikey gang though?
[4:00:10] <%DedlokPM> "I love Heck" Pat "Christian Stream" Boivon
[4:00:17] <bleugh> h*ck off
[4:00:20] <%SiameseSneeze> My most used guns are the Vasto Prime and Tiberon Prime, but for melee, Destreza Prime, love that shit
[4:00:23] <$SirTerribleh> What's a k?
[4:00:24] <dirtyjustice> Hear that "rrring rring" of the bike's little bell signally foodmaggedon
[4:00:30] <KayThree> Buddy, I respect u, but if u think i'm goin on the riven grind ur a madman
[4:00:33] <IntrepidEye> I love the Corinth. Not in the OP tier but still pretty good
[4:00:36] <$SirTerribleh> Thousand?
[4:00:39] <dirtyjustice> signaling*
[4:00:46] <dekkitout> ju blaz
[4:00:48] <%SiameseSneeze> Who doesn't love a good pump action shotgun?
[4:00:49] <Angry_Ev1L> The worst part is - new CUDA cores are good. If nvidia just put the same amount of them as on 1080ti instead of meme tensor cores and RTX ON it would've been the strongest bestests GPU ever...
[4:00:55] <Angry_Ev1L> But we need meme
[4:01:06] <TheShadowWolfen> food biker challenges your pokemon to a battle for 50% off your food
[4:01:14] <enoughmold> @AngriestPat i want to get into silent hill witch one would you recommend
[4:01:15] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> I mean sure if you have punch through
[4:01:17] <%spacekataz18> I heard that tiberon prime there is super nice, I gotta try it out myself
[4:01:18] <%ribboons> Its all about the big numbers
[4:01:21] <%ThatRandomGuy661> A little bit more feels better for those shotguns
[4:01:24] <KaliasTV> Top wfbuilder builds usually put garbage mods on which give more dps in the calculator but suck
[4:01:36] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I'm tellin' ya man get a Strun Wraith in your life
[4:01:38] <Worldbrand> At that much damage yeah you can swap a mod for some utility
[4:01:39] <+Chud_Pudsley> @Angry_Ev1L They need to get their driver support game out of the shitter.
[4:01:53] <Caidezes> BUT IT'S A DPS RACE
[4:01:57] <GodlyLuigi> @AngriestPat i tweeted you something about my red moa you saw
[4:01:57] <%HRDSalami654> Corinth is just good times. The airburst takes getting used to, but man is it satisfying to land.
[4:02:00] <+SuichiTanaka> I prefer my Vaykor with 12 shots and punchthrough
[4:02:06] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> You build Vaykor Hek for crit right? Pretty sure it's a crit version
[4:02:07] <Crankthulhu> Yeah, dont use Warframebuilder as Word of God, a lot of top builds are moronic
[4:02:14] <%SiameseSneeze> Yes The_Lady_Alustriel
[4:02:18] <TheShadowWolfen> toxic barrage, dont you mean 1/3 of all internet comminities?
[4:02:22] <+RushUnplugged> that's the best thing, wfbuilder is a hint to how build a gun, but do it your way
[4:02:30] <Zombrocom> Primed point blank, hells chamber, the crit mods, blaze, another elemental or two, seeking fury, bam
[4:02:32] <%MagickBurritoh> What about the Marelock?
[4:02:35] <+SuichiTanaka> It leaves normal Hek as "dead now." and Vaykor as my constant main
[4:02:42] <Crankthulhu> Theyve got max Ability Strength Banshee Quake builds where she gets killed in one shot because its overspecialized for ESO
[4:02:49] <%SiameseSneeze> I mean, every gun kind of has those mods that are like absolutely required
[4:02:50] <Piiavc> did i miss ds3?
[4:02:51] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @SiameseSneeze it's so close to that 29%
[4:02:55] <Worldbrand> the marelok has that sweet flip and it is a respectable weapon but it has fallen far behind
[4:02:55] <Jamiebb846> How long is stream been up
[4:02:58] <kingofspirits1> bro this game is hard asf
[4:02:58] <%ribboons> How do you guys deal the damage in warframe?
[4:03:06] <%MagickBurritoh> 4 hrs now
[4:03:16] <%Baesel20xx> Do bounties count towards daily faction cap? or even if you've capped through turn ins, can you still do each mission once for standing?
[4:03:17] <dirtyjustice> Tickle Gun (Phage) is the best shotgun Kappa
[4:03:20] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @ribboons mods
[4:03:23] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> or a Riven instead of Seeking Fury Kappa
[4:03:24] <IntrepidEye> 5 years in and I still haven't maxed my damage mods. I really should get on that
[4:03:24] <DracaenaLeaf> cya
[4:03:35] <dekkitout> time for the phat beats
[4:03:37] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> oh god I forgot aleady
[4:03:38] <+KanjiTatsumi> You can get food delivery at 4am?
[4:03:39] <%HRDSalami654> I love my punch through as well.
[4:03:40] <%ribboons> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS I know that I mean what mods and stuff
[4:03:41] <TheShadowWolfen> poke battle incoming
[4:03:41] <%MagickBurritoh> not a funky fresh beat
[4:03:42] <cerberuscarmine> time to dab
[4:03:43] <TerraWraith> No, go back to the good music
[4:03:45] <+RushUnplugged> @ribboons level up gun, put mods in, level up mods, do damage
[4:03:47] <Worldbrand> @Baesel20xx Yes, and they just patched it so that it will show you +0 standing gain on the bounty phases where you have capped
[4:03:56] <Piiavc> no but for invasions, where is pat at in ds3 and what sl / weapon level do i need
[4:03:58] <Youknowwhyimhere008> atpFeelsBeardMan 🎻
[4:04:01] <+Ell1ot> i'm not used to this song yet. i miss the other one
[4:04:01] <MrPedrovsky> This sounds so much like Nutshack
[4:04:14] <Estuko> @TerraWraith it's the whole twitch no likes copyrighted music thing
[4:04:19] <%Baesel20xx> @Worldbrand ah thanks!
[4:04:19] <Angry_Ev1L> @Chud_Pudsley they need to unfuckup a lot of things
[4:04:19] <SiegeJay> This sounds like ass Kappa
[4:04:26] <+Gravity_Gunner> What is this music? mikeliveSkeletor
[4:04:26] <KayThree> gonna straight up provide a leblanc theme remix to save this track
[4:04:27] <+Aleate> NotLikeThis
[4:04:30] <%SiameseSneeze> I like ass though KappaRoss
[4:04:31] <GodlyLuigi> ITS. THE. PAT SHACK
[4:04:32] <Bouldus> why is there a bong in the background of this song? Kappa
[4:04:32] <%MagickBurritoh> oh cool, farts are used as notes in this
[4:04:32] <Xystant> reminds me of adult swim
[4:04:36] <+Chud_Pudsley> @Angry_Ev1L Lol.....Yeah
[4:04:39] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Chat I'm really sad none of you mentioned Strun Wraith at all
[4:04:50] <+Chud_Pudsley> @MagickBurritoh You love them shut up
[4:04:55] <dirtyjustice> Strun Wraith is good
[4:04:57] <+SuichiTanaka> I haven't managed to get the Strun Wraith yet
[4:04:59] <TheShadowWolfen> your right @mrpedrovsky and i hate you for it
[4:05:00] <%MagickBurritoh> apatWink
[4:05:08] <KayThree> @The_Lady_Alustriel i'm busy lusting after ignis wraith
[4:05:11] <TheShadowWolfen> now thats all i hear
[4:05:21] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> SuichiTanaka it took me a while but I'm glad I did. That thing is great and well worth the effort
[4:05:28] <%SaltyDongs> shouldn't it be social eating broby
[4:05:29] <%HRDSalami654> Strun Wraith was ruined by the reload changes.
[4:05:29] <dekkitout> if you think this is bad, none of you have had the dis-privilege of listening to 6ix9ine
[4:05:30] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> KayThree what platform are you on?
[4:05:35] <+SuichiTanaka> The alerts are just never up when I'm around
[4:05:44] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> HRDSalami654 how so? It seems fine to me
[4:05:46] <KayThree> @The_Lady_Alustriel pc lol, picked it back up after some friends reminded me it existed - only mr 7 :(
[4:05:50] <%SiameseSneeze> I like Strun Wraith, but in general, I usually take an assault rifle even though they're not super meta from what I've heard
[4:06:07] <Worldbrand> neat as the strun wraith is, I'm just too lazy. If I'm taking a shotgun, it's the sobek.
[4:06:12] <+SuichiTanaka> A slash build Braton Prime does really well early on
[4:06:12] <+keksisblyat> honestly this music is growing on me
[4:06:17] <TheShadowWolfen> Alert Alert
[4:06:22] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> KayThree ah ok. Once you're MR 9 gimme a shout I think my Alliance has it
[4:06:31] <+Chud_Pudsley> I like the wet techno farts
[4:06:33] <TheShadowWolfen> hey look two alerts are up doodGood
[4:06:38] <%MagickBurritoh> I like the weird squishy fluid part
[4:06:40] <KayThree> @The_Lady_Alustriel no kidding? cheers m8
[4:06:49] <MrPedrovsky> Am i right to assume that the Hammer is strongest in Monster Hunter World because is has the highest damage number in stat sheet to the right?? Sorry just started
[4:07:00] <TheShadowWolfen> idek
[4:07:05] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> KayThree yeah no kidding man. Nobody should ever pay for that thing
[4:07:08] <KayThree> no ur right to assume the hammer is strongest because its a big smashy hammer
[4:07:13] <KayThree> and thats just science
[4:07:13] <+Chud_Pudsley> @MrPedrovsky Yes but just use wtfe you want
[4:07:14] <+keksisblyat> Gonna watch the stream on mah phonez Ill be baaaaaack
[4:07:15] <%heckyell> well, it has its purpose
[4:07:17] <+SuichiTanaka> In Monster Hunter, all weapons are equally good. Hammer has a TON of damage, but it's harder to get openings for that damage
[4:07:31] <TheShadowWolfen> i use katana, cause monster slaying samurai is my oc
[4:07:34] <SiegeJay> @MrPedrovsky No. Strongest weapon in Monster Hunter is pure subjective
[4:07:36] <%heckyell> all weapons have their roles and it isn't always damage that matters
[4:07:37] <dekkitout> and if you dont have rocksteady, god help you
[4:07:47] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @ribboons I mean it really depends what you're looking at.If it's a crit weapon you throw on something like vital sense for extra crit for big damage.If it's a status weapon you throw on elemental mods and something to increase the status chance which leads to more sustained damage.
[4:08:02] <%HRDSalami654> It's the hunting horn.
[4:08:09] <%heckyell> if you're a hammer user you should be using it to open up armored spots and hit the head to try and knock mons out.
[4:08:11] <dekkitout> or be like me and be a scrub who uses urgaan set with a gunlance
[4:08:17] <+SuichiTanaka> Hunting horn does a LOT of damage, if you line it up right
[4:08:22] <MrPedrovsky> @chud_pudsley well I don’t want to hinder myself by prolonging quests by doing no damage and have high enough armor defence (not accountig for elemental) to tank hits bacically
[4:08:34] <+Beruptor> every time it gets to this techno fart part I can't help but squirm a bit
[4:08:34] <%Kirijuo> Not gonna lie, this song is good, but it gives me a headache
[4:08:37] <TheShadowWolfen> i saw the best hunting horn meme with jack black, 10/10 reccomend
[4:08:38] <%SaltyDongs> Sup
[4:08:41] <Max_Capacity> Mute

[4:08:47] <%SiameseSneeze> Yeah, Damage isn't everything. There's people who bring weapons to just destroy Dropships and they get like fuckin 70% damage, but have few kills. I bring my Tiberon Prime and usually have at least 2nd most kills from killing ground forces
[4:08:50] <cerberuscarmine> !raffle
[4:08:50] <@Moobot> Added one or more users to the raffle
[4:08:51] <DracaenaLeaf> Oh no

[4:08:54] <%DedlokPM> MUTED
[4:08:57] <SiegeJay> If you are targeting a monster with big Weak Spot, Bow is the strongest in terms of DPS because if you can land all 5 hits from a wide shot and have them all crit. They will deal the most damage
[4:08:58] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> not for one second pat
[4:08:58] <bleugh> what!!!

[4:09:44] <Crankthulhu> Unfortunately yes
[4:09:44] <%Baesel20xx> nah

[4:09:45] <NopeBadguy> !raffle
[4:09:46] <%MagickBurritoh> what
[4:09:47] <+SuichiTanaka> Yes, though about equal

[4:09:49] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> nah
[4:09:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> realy?
[4:09:52] <dekkitout> depends on who you talk to
[4:09:52] <Angry_Ev1L> pfff MURICANS
[4:09:53] <%Voidwyvern> Depends on the family
[4:09:54] <cerberuscarmine> nope
[4:09:55] <+AngriestAngryArtist> for dem sales!
[4:09:56] <+HypestMoose> Noooo
[4:09:56] <CutCombo> ???
[4:09:57] <%MagickBurritoh> They're pretty much equal
[4:09:59] <Angry_Ev1L> On the other hand I hate christmas too
[4:09:59] <%ribboons> its because they love family and love eating fat birds
[4:10:01] <$RaikenTB> it's really awkward now.
[4:10:02] <hntronium> Sounds like heresy
[4:10:07] <DracaenaLeaf> thanksgiving can be with all the family members while christmas could be individual families
[4:10:07] <ArtThouBored> Hahahaha
[4:10:10] <%heckyell> pat is becoming Kenny
[4:10:10] <%DedlokPM> FAMIBLY
[4:10:10] <NopeBadguy> it's like matt and rustle
[4:10:11] <try_it_sis_> christmas is HUGE. thanksgiving is whatever.
[4:10:12] <%PenmanLupine> People have to focus on their families more. Christmas you can distract yourself with presents and junk
[4:10:12] <%spacekataz18> Family family family
[4:10:16] <nepwar> couple goals
[4:10:23] <+Chud_Pudsley> Fambs Fambs can't change it

[4:10:26] <SiegeJay> FAMILY FAMILY FAMLY
[4:10:27] <+NWR_James> Travel is more crowded around Thanksgiving. People have less time off so they jam all the travel into the same days
[4:10:28] <+SuichiTanaka> If you really have to choose one, Xmas is the holiday of choice, but they're about equal
[4:10:30] <$KnivesEve> @AngriestPat omg your still streaming? too much red bull again?

[4:10:44] <%SiameseSneeze> Really? From my experience, people cream their pants over Christmas, we don't blast Thanksgiving music Pat, we blast goddamn Christmas music on November 1st, we skip over Thanksgiving except for the one fuckin day
[4:10:44] <+RushUnplugged> bit low but it works
[4:10:44] <+Ell1ot> not over here it's not. stores over here started decorating for Christmas right after Halloween

[4:12:14] <MrPedrovsky> @angriestpat Your best beginner tip for someone who has World as his first MonHun and just finished the first diabolos story mission by stunning everything with hammer and just pressing O button?

[4:12:20] <+keksisblyat> @angriestpat Soooooo..... AFTER DMC REBOOT.....BAYONETTA???
[4:12:20] <%Kirijuo> The unedited pee break was way worse than the bagel
[4:12:21] <dirtyjustice> Loud food = Pop rocks
[4:12:23] <qaaj> Howdy Pat! :)
[4:12:25] <lilo52> i didn't notice the bagel sounds
[4:12:27] <TheShadowWolfen> does that mean if pat eats the mic, he is also consuming elmo?
[4:12:31] <mongol_800> can't hear the gulping sounds Pat
[4:12:34] <%heckyell> what if elmo could transfer his consciousness to wherever he left his fur and he is currently with you in spirit
[4:12:35] <+Gravity_Gunner> That’s not McDonalds!
[4:12:42] <NopeBadguy> Would you rather increasingly loud food or increasingly spicy food
[4:12:42] <%Voidwyvern> which DMC playthrough?
[4:12:43] <TalisKanju> Can't see the food

[4:14:39] <DracaenaLeaf> cream cheeese is better but peanut butter is easier to have
[4:14:41] <%heckyell> have you ever made a PB&J but with waffles for bread?
[4:14:41] <TerraWraith> I'm not a fan of peanut butter
[4:14:43] <NopeBadguy> i have not had a good bagel
[4:14:45] <+RushUnplugged> fast forward 100 years, the Mars Catgirls created by the Great Muskman will declare war on the Earth

[4:14:46] <NopeBadguy> i'd rather just have toast
[4:14:46] <+keksisblyat> Cream cheese for me, never heard of peanut butter on a bagel
[4:14:53] <CaptainSama> happy USA thanksgiving everyone time to hate your cousins and get fat and take selfies with your drunk uncles
[4:14:53] <+Gravity_Gunner> Peanut butter only exists to make dogs swallow pills. There is no reason for humans to eat it.
[4:14:55] <TheShadowWolfen> neither is better than a toasted cinimon raison bagel with butter in the morning imho
[4:14:57] <$KnivesEve> id prefer mecha over catgirls. ive excepted dying alone
[4:14:59] <%SiameseSneeze> I wasn't asking you, Pat Kappa

[4:21:22] <%MagickBurritoh> Putzin

[4:21:56] <770megaman> Wat is its?!?!?!
[4:21:57] <%MagickBurritoh> FALSE ADVERTISING
[4:21:58] <Crankthulhu> @risenlp2 Yep, we Ashen now
[4:22:00] <$rdark_ksu> social eating i think
[4:22:01] <+Chud_Pudsley> @nepwar Its fries covered in cheese sauce
[4:22:03] <TalisKanju> Poutine's the only thing we can't seem to get in California
[4:22:03] <NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat I think Food is supposed to be cooking related
[4:22:10] <%Gespens> Social Eating or Just Chatting?
[4:22:10] <MorbidStandUser> im so confused
[4:22:11] <+Aleate> Isn't it social eating? Or did that change, like everything else in my life? FeelsBadMan
[4:22:14] <+LogothX> Poutine is a figment of the liberal media
[4:22:18] <nepwar> cooking
[4:22:19] <TequiloBlanka> Looks like Bachelor Chow from Futurama
[4:22:20] <%MagickBurritoh> Do IRL
[4:22:20] <MajinRaviel> they removed a bunch of thing
[4:22:21] <DomunDomunDomun> Just chatting?
[4:22:21] <%SaltyDongs> social eating with food and drinks
[4:22:24] <TequiloBlanka> Brown and somewhat moist
[4:22:26] <%ribboons> Yeah this is creative, because its banned in china due to the skeleton
[4:22:28] <MajinRaviel> just chatting would be fine I guess
[4:22:29] <770megaman> Is that elmos FLESH?!?
[4:22:36] <ltdogg07> make some cereal then you can say you cooked
[4:22:40] <%FrostMass22> Where is the category for painting your tits?

[4:23:15] <%FrostMass22> Pat, paint your balls
[4:23:19] <dekkitout> twitch, you are going down the oath of anakin, becoming the thin you swore to destroy
[4:23:20] <Alef321> RIVETING
[4:23:23] <%ribboons> @nepwar the one in the back who looks like he's seen some stuff
[4:23:28] <dirtyjustice> Food and Drink I think is for the foodies that stream from bars/restaurants

[4:23:42] <%Voidwyvern> Pat I'm so glad you're late streaming. I never get to tune in live cause of work
[4:23:43] <SiegeJay> YES
[4:23:46] <ltdogg07> just do it and see
[4:23:46] <TequiloBlanka> Paiting your nuts would be like dying a couple Cadbury Mini Eggs
[4:23:48] <NopeBadguy> DON'T
[4:23:48] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> holy shit chat I was joking earlier about getting a Tombfinger riven and I actually just opened a Tombfinger riven
[4:23:48] <Rockgagong> what is patdad eating
[4:23:50] <nepwar> @ribboons oh i thought you meant eating got banned in china because of a skeleton
[4:23:50] <cerberuscarmine> ITS ART PAIGE
[4:23:52] <$rdark_ksu> discrimination!
[4:23:53] <770megaman> Whens the sextape with Woolie?!?
[4:23:54] <%FrostMass22> Quit bodyshaming, Paige

[4:23:56] <talfurt> Try it out paint a bat

[4:24:03] <MajinRaviel> What? Context is important?!
[4:24:06] <+Havren13> Tanuki Pat
[4:24:09] <%SaltyDongs> High fashion nut painting
[4:24:10] <nepwar> its modern art,
[4:24:15] <+Aleate> In this context, can my nuts be painted then? Kappa
[4:24:15] <MorbidStandUser> 3:30 am for i, wtf am i doing.....WHAT ARE WE DOING?!?
[4:24:15] <%FrostMass22> The context is Twitch thots wanting money from 12 year olds
[4:24:15] <%ribboons> @nepwar nope apparently skeletons are banned in china
[4:24:18] <+NovaTera> stop censoring pats creativity
[4:24:20] <hntronium> I think that counts as animal aboos
[4:24:25] <%MagickBurritoh> didn't have to paint much
[4:24:27] <+NWR_James> WHAT, 9000?!
[4:24:31] <enoughmold> If it's cold and the nuts are shriveld
[4:24:32] <DuoScratch> @MorbidStandUser waiting to see how this plays out.
[4:24:33] <nepwar> @ribboons damn one step ahead in the skeleton war
[4:24:37] <770megaman> Is that NUT cheese you are eating?!?
[4:24:39] <TalisKanju> China stopped the skeletons from fighting
[4:24:42] <NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Have you gotten started on Fist of the North Star yet?
[4:24:56] <TerraWraith> You could paint your nuts, and make shlorpy dance, and that probably is unique enough to be art
[4:24:58] <Bouldus> once you "get it" theyre never a challenge again
[4:24:59] <%Kirijuo> Can I paint my dick like squidwards nose that he adds to works of arts?
[4:25:01] <NopeBadguy> HIDEBU
[4:25:02] <GGPaulyB> noxthaWHOSMANS

[4:25:12] <TheShadowWolfen> paint his fist to look like nuts?
[4:25:14] <NopeBadguy> And a Gacha?
[4:25:17] <%heckyell> Souls is a game that constantly demands your attention, you can't just gallivant around willy-nilly.
[4:25:21] <%ribboons> its Yakuza Immortal
[4:25:24] <Rockgagong> Pat and Paige best couple 2k19 forever

[4:43:23] <AzirothTheGreat> Very shallow pool to hunt
[4:43:26] <Estuko> @ribboons didn't the remaster pull people fro mthe original game then ended up killing the player population for both?
[4:43:33] <%FackinCrazy> LOL

[5:02:12] <Hydrapissed> armor wont save him lol
[5:02:13] <$Bonkasaurusrex> Man, Fallout 76 is a bad video game.
[5:02:13] <101shadesofwonderful> Hey, you got one at least.
[5:02:15] <Hydrapissed> that shit is a myth in ds3
[5:02:16] <Shaunx2> just passing by
[5:02:17] <$SirTerribleh> You have no poise my dood
[5:02:18] <TheShadowWolfen> motherfkers aint nothin but beaches
[5:02:18] <DuoScratch> @Foobe with that mace? Might not be feasable.
[5:02:19] <urkleturtle> well, he needed help for the boss so now he's fucked
[5:02:21] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[5:02:25] <%SaltyDongs> EmLo
[5:02:25] <Worldbrand> elmo is a person
[5:02:25] <kvassimoto> haunted mansion
[5:02:27] <synthcutter> E M L O
[5:02:30] <%LupaTheWolf> he thinks he's people
[5:02:31] <MSN04_Sazabi> Armor or DS3, you have to pick one
[5:02:31] <DracaenaLeaf> I one time mistook a little kid for a dog
[5:02:33] <%spacekataz18> Elmo start walking like a person
[5:02:40] <+Gravity_Gunner> M O L E
[5:02:41] <Bouldus> it hasnt in ds3
[5:02:42] <Piiavc> poise works whilke your swinging
[5:02:42] <Mordox> is that a mace in your hand or are you just happy to see us
[5:02:42] <CaptainKarite> It hasn't worked since ds2
[5:02:42] <TerraWraith> I'm on the same timezone as them, so it's 5 in the morning
[5:02:43] <%SolitudeOtM> Poise works fine Pat
[5:02:45] <kvassimoto> you have to verify your poise
[5:02:46] <+RushUnplugged> it's hyper-armor during your hits
[5:02:46] <FortuneEX> @AngriestPat it is like hyper armor on your moves
[5:02:47] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> more poise = more hyper armour
[5:02:47] <AzirothTheGreat> Poor man’s Rose these chumps
[5:02:47] <MSN04_Sazabi> Poise works like hyperarmor
[5:02:48] <+Foobe> oh okay. just go nude then. armor doesn't mean anything i guess!
[5:02:49] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Poise is hyperarmour @AngriestPat
[5:02:49] <Logan_Jennings1> Fuckin Poise in DS3 is so goddamn complicated
[5:02:50] <Zombrocom> Ok so
[5:02:50] <nepwar> poise is just a myth
[5:02:51] <sodium_station> blue phantoms, otherwise known as the popo
[5:02:56] <corrosivePaladin> Yea isnt there a switch in DS3 labeled poise thats just turned off
[5:02:56] <Hydrapissed> Poise = hyper armor trading so it dont work unless u use ur weapon art on that mace @AngriestPat
[5:02:56] <TheShadowWolfen> elmo's alter ego omle
[5:02:56] <Zombrocom> Poise is active DURING YOUR SWINGS
[5:02:56] <Caidezes> Poise is basically hyper armor.
[5:03:00] <Zombrocom> But not during neutral
[5:03:06] <%ribboons> you have more poise in bloodborne than ds33
[5:03:06] <+Foobe> ^ that
[5:03:06] <%SolitudeOtM> @AngriestPat It works kinda like an invisible health bar in DS3
[5:03:08] <kvassimoto> Started at the bottom now we here
[5:03:10] <TheShadowWolfen> revengence
[5:03:10] <Tampaoster> its the same guy
[5:03:11] <aiyobro> is he using password matching?
[5:03:15] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> so hyper armour
[5:03:16] <DuoScratch> @sodium_station purple phantoms are better anyway.
[5:03:16] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Poise is basically hyper armour
[5:03:17] <TerraWraith> Is this the guy that bitched out before?
[5:03:18] <Tampaoster> its hyper armor basically
[5:03:23] <Hydrapissed> Poise = hyper armor trading so it dont work unless u use ur weapon art on that mace mm
[5:03:29] <kvassimoto> Started at the bottom now the whole crew here
[5:03:30] <+Gravity_Gunner> I just realised, Elmo is Dracula backwards
[5:03:37] <Zombrocom> Hyper armour with a limit based on your armours poise values
[5:03:40] <+RushUnplugged> using the skills from some weapons like that mace, gives you more poise/more hyper frames
[5:03:51] <+Sir_Carl> How the hell did they fuck up poise after 3 games got it right? It's such a core part of souls
[5:03:51] <TerraWraith> No, it isn't teh bitch, it's the mace girl!
[5:03:54] <urkleturtle> you got juked
[5:03:55] <harraceharrison> Ratblocked
[5:03:56] <sodium_station> active while swinging BIG weapon. better if you have BIG armor
[5:04:06] <%spacekataz18> SAME GUY
[5:04:11] <Logan_Jennings1> Weaponart the guy do iiiiit
[5:04:23] <%MagickBurritoh> fire vs ice
[5:04:26] <CaptainKarite> rematch
[5:04:29] <+RushUnplugged> it's a choice, because fighting high poise people was anti-fun
[5:04:33] <DuoScratch> And this is a grudge match! Will Jrake regain their honor!?
[5:04:34] <eggsnbakefest> Dandruff vs Rash, who will win
[5:04:37] <+Gravity_Gunner> Rats, the tutorial enemy of every RPG ever
[5:04:51] <Piiavc> dang

[5:05:26] <%SolitudeOtM> @AngriestPat Ya need to learn how to bait out the parries, to get them delicious backstabs

[5:09:33] <+infeliciter> @AngriestPat For some reason I am not getting notifications that you are live. I re-followed you and had to wait 10 min to say this.
[5:09:34] <SirSmudgey> How do you even pvp in this lagfest
[5:09:36] <urkleturtle> can you actually roll through status procs in ds3 like you could in 1?
[5:09:42] <%moranprime> Those screen peekers knew whats up
[5:09:42] <%SolitudeOtM> Well the blue symbol meant he's over-leveled, so it indeed a password summon
[5:09:45] <Mujihi> is that the same guy who pulled the plug last time?
[5:09:47] <Hydrapissed> it reduces damage taken
[5:09:47] <%moranprime> Kappa

[5:15:22] <%ribboons> Ahh ds3
[5:15:22] <Six_The_Ripper> cato
[5:15:24] <%SolitudeOtM> The dragon slayer outta nowhere
[5:15:27] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Dragonslayer Armour in the flesh ... or armour
[5:15:29] <Hydrapissed> uh oh INVADED
[5:15:32] <sodium_station> This is the best part of dark souls 3 MP
[5:15:37] <Triplicat> dragonslayer had the money in the bank
[5:15:38] <dekkitout> ornsteins shitlord lil brother
[5:15:38] <lilo52> THE BABY
[5:15:44] <sodium_station> When everyone from every single fucking covenant gets dragged into one dude's game
[5:15:48] <+azure22900> Dark Souls 3 invasions are so cowardly on the defenders side. Flee and summon an army of allies all day.
[5:15:59] <%king_strongstyle> It’s ok there’s always summer slam
[5:16:00] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> if you lock off when they try to roll through your swings you can sometimes catch them trying to backstab
[5:16:03] <kvassimoto> you are being invaded
[5:16:14] <DuoScratch> @azure22900 well, that's random invades, it's just the name of the game.
[5:16:23] <kvassimoto> rude
[5:16:34] <nepwar> so cool
[5:16:35] <+Hamblasto> Why is Pat still up?
[5:16:35] <+Foobe> unbelievable. the audacity to point downward.
[5:16:35] <Hydrapissed> wait is that the runner guy from before?
[5:16:42] <%ribboons> The Disrespect
[5:16:43] <PEShDotEXE> Finally somebody picked up the online part DS3 and did not cower behind offline!
[5:16:55] <%MagickBurritoh> Just fuckin mime at each other for an hour
[5:17:07] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> If this guy plays it right a straightsword will fuck your day up
[5:17:13] <RichAnvils> who is the Red Princess
[5:17:19] <+Foobe> great trades!
[5:17:20] <Hydrapissed> lol
[5:17:20] <longrat> hey pat you should definitely try to play with an unlocked camera
[5:17:21] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> and they didn't play it right
[5:17:27] <DuoScratch> EZ Clap
[5:17:29] <longrat> with heavy weapons you can change your attack direction
[5:17:30] <dekkitout> you merely adopted the skeletons as your ally
[5:17:31] <PEShDotEXE> lanipaLoud
[5:17:33] <longrat> really messes players up
[5:17:34] <TerraWraith> He fought honorably. And died like a dog
[5:17:40] <%king_strongstyle> Buried
[5:17:44] <%ribboons> you just scratch your ass over his corpse?
[5:17:55] <Logan_Jennings1> If I learned anything from Game of Thrones, fuck Honor it doesn't do anything good for you
[5:17:57] <DuoScratch> jundSweat He never stood a chance
[5:18:02] <TerraWraith> Goes to show, lie, steat, cheal
[5:18:07] <%CrimsonCore90> Pocket sand!
[5:18:16] <%SolitudeOtM> @AngriestPat Never fight with honour, always invade with the intent to kill
[5:18:18] <nepwar> in those times, having honor was sub-optimal
[5:18:23] <TheChillRoom> Pocket sand clearly trumped trying to put on a good show ;) But I respect it
[5:18:29] <synthcutter> yes
[5:18:32] <Piiavc> armour with higher poise
[5:18:34] <grimporio> armor has a poise stat, yes
[5:18:35] <Hydrapissed> Higher armor and wolf ring lol I guess
[5:18:37] <harraceharrison> Big heavy
[5:18:39] <thefakeh> big poise for big bois
[5:18:40] <%TaifuDragon> Higher armor, and bigger swingy weapons
[5:18:43] <+Foobe> bigger armor, bigger weapons, or if you're COOL, use the weapon art that gives 'poise'
[5:18:43] <%king_strongstyle> This giant mace has NO HONOR
[5:18:46] <Piiavc> sun guy body is pretty posie efficient for lower levels
[5:18:46] <urkleturtle> you get poise by acting dignified
[5:18:47] <kvassimoto> check your email for the poise verification code
[5:18:49] <Hydrapissed> dlc
[5:18:51] <+Hamblasto> Lie, Steat, Cheal. The motto of Eddie Guillermo
[5:18:56] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> the ds1 definition of poise doesn't exist anymore unless you use iron flesh
[5:18:58] <Hydrapissed> yep
[5:19:00] <+enickma11> Wait did they change poise from not being a thing?
[5:19:00] <%ribboons> best poise ring is in the last dlc
[5:19:03] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> wait what
[5:19:03] <+RushUnplugged> wolf ring adds bonus poise, it's from the swamp covenant
[5:19:10] <grimporio> there's a wolf ring in the base game
[5:19:10] <corrosivePaladin> No. Wolf Ring +3 is dlc
[5:19:16] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> no it's not dlc you get it from the wolf covenant
[5:19:23] <grimporio> but the best version is in the ringed city dlc
[5:19:23] <Hydrapissed> wolf ring + 3 dlc guys
[5:19:24] <$KnivesEve> ok im dead now gnight everybody
[5:19:25] <Hydrapissed> stfooo
[5:19:28] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat from the wolf
[5:19:30] <%TaifuDragon> yeah
[5:19:30] <longrat> @AngriestPat you should try to play PVP without locking onto the enemy, you can change the direction you'll attack mid swing and people get tripped up by that
[5:19:30] <eggsnbakefest> Alrighty, @AngriestPat , I think I'm gonna go play a little of this game myself! But I swear, if you invade me, I shall return with an undying wrath
[5:19:31] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> pretty much FeelsBadMan
[5:19:34] <%ribboons> Yeah :D
[5:19:34] <%TaifuDragon> yeah that covenant
[5:19:43] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> there is also a +3 dlc version but you're far from that
[5:19:44] <corrosivePaladin> Why is Wolf cov unplayable now?
[5:19:46] <+daSL08> I thought when you die you drop all your gear?
[5:19:49] <Logan_Jennings1> Glad I got the stuff out of it before then..
[5:19:50] <max_radical> pat go tf to bed
[5:19:50] <DuoScratch> Why's the Watchdogs unplayable???
[5:19:51] <TerraWraith> If only Black Katana Skeleton were here to see this.
[5:19:53] <%Metballs> That sucks, does the aldritch one still work?
[5:19:54] <AzirothTheGreat> U need 10 wolf bloodgrass to get it
[5:19:55] <Piiavc> its unplayable after level 30
[5:19:59] <grimporio> @AngriestPat can you show stats and level?
[5:20:01] <+Foobe> @eggsnbakefest gud luck
[5:20:01] <%king_strongstyle> Yea join NWO wolf pact
[5:20:06] <Hydrapissed> u can run to ringed city and kill alva to get the ring in dlc
[5:20:07] <%TaifuDragon> It works early on but the zone is just too soon in the game for it to match you very high
[5:20:08] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @daSL08 nah just your money effectively
[5:20:09] <%SolitudeOtM> @AngriestPat Go buy the exile armor from the shrine maiden, also, the wolf covenant is fine? Never had any problems with it
[5:20:14] <%TaifuDragon> If you keep a low level build you can hide in there for a good while
[5:20:17] <corrosivePaladin> Oh yea. Wolf cov is pretty much Lowlv pvp only
[5:20:17] <%TaifuDragon> but even then it's sparse
[5:20:27] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> it did work when there were more players but it's kinda bad when it hinges on people going through an area for the first time
[5:20:34] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Hey chat are Bloodshades still a thing LUL
[5:20:37] <+Foobe> goodbye skeleton ball :(
[5:20:40] <+daSL08> I swear I played a Dark Souls where you dropped ALL your gear when you died.
[5:20:44] <Logan_Jennings1> you can also farm the grass too...which is what I did now that I think about it
[5:20:45] <%ribboons> rip skeleton ball
[5:20:45] <%TaifuDragon> It's always just been matchmaking
[5:20:51] <+RushUnplugged> it works rarely because it's a transition zone, less people than a "late game" area like irityll
[5:20:52] <+Foobe> RIP CRAB
[5:20:53] <max_radical> DS covenants have always been either "it worked for me" or "it literally never once worked for me"
[5:20:54] <%SolitudeOtM> Maybe your confusing it with the nito covenant from ds1?
[5:20:57] <%ribboons> and crab
[5:21:00] <AzirothTheGreat> Just farm the Darkwraiths for wolfgrass
[5:21:00] <TerraWraith> NOOOOOO HE WAS MY CRABBO FRIEND
[5:21:01] <corrosivePaladin> I had zero problem completing wolf cov. Though I also only use lv20 characters...
[5:21:06] <Hydrapissed> yeah u can get a lot of +3 rings in the ringed dlc if u wana be a nerd
[5:21:13] <%Tredecian> @AngriestPat did plague ever figure out the crab?
[5:21:16] <%spacekataz18> I gotta slep, I'm too tired good nite Pat, Paige and Elmo and good luck on more good invasion
[5:21:19] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> No Wolf Covenant definitely didn't work on release for a large majority of players
[5:21:19] <RichAnvils> ghrus have wolfgrass
[5:21:27] <urkleturtle> wolf covenant was amazing on pc release. it was always such a clusterfuck as you just had. invaders, phantoms, crabs. oh my
[5:21:40] <%spacekataz18> Good nite strem don't stay up too late turkey await
[5:21:41] <nepwar> good night trede
[5:21:41] <$Mendin> crab covenant
[5:21:45] <Logan_Jennings1> Yep, farmed the ghrus between the boss in the swamp. Boy it took ages.

[5:21:57] <nepwar> good night spacekataz
[5:22:07] <%ribboons> Did paige leave or pass out?

[5:32:04] <CloudCircus> @angriestpat Fallout 76 is 33% off on Xbox
[5:32:08] <Tampaoster> nope
[5:32:11] <$Mendin> that would require Pat to be able to cook
[5:32:12] <%peppertimelady> @angriestpat i think my insomnia can be blamed on me tonight bc i was watching spoopy videos like a fool
[5:32:27] <TerraWraith> None are cooler than Black Katana Skeleton. The father of all other skeletons!
[5:32:39] <%ribboons> The jojo fists though
[5:32:42] <kvassimoto> eat souls to grow HUGE
[5:32:42] <Hydrapissed> sell em its faster
[5:32:54] <%SolitudeOtM> Eat the Deacon soul

[5:33:12] <%johnny_gogo> Lets go
[5:33:17] <%FackinCrazy> If you hide info it doesnt kick you out of the menu
[5:33:20] <+keksisblyat> FIST WEAPONS ARE GREAT YOURE JUST MEAN
[5:33:22] <CheekyBirb> faster sure, but is it satisfying? nuh uh
[5:33:37] <nepwar> why would merchants buy souls? wouldn't they just break it for the same amount of souls?
[5:33:43] <%SolitudeOtM> @AngriestPat if you click the right stick, in the inventory, it doesn't throw you out of the menu
[5:33:44] <cinless> pat its like 4 am don't you have work
[5:33:45] <%ribboons> how long is this stream gonna go?
[5:33:51] <TerraWraith> You can do a power geyser with those fire fists!
[5:33:53] <+jyrecko> wtf Pat it's 5:30
[5:34:03] <%johnny_gogo> 2:34

[5:34:59] <+ricotez> if you have more health you die less harder
[5:34:59] <%SolitudeOtM> @AngriestPat if you click the right stick, in the inventory, it doesn't throw you out of the menu, also Poise is only affected by equipment and rings, far as I know
[5:34:59] <kvassimoto> huge health
[5:35:06] <Hydrapissed> kk
[5:35:14] <Ser_Ser_Ser> mathematical man
[5:35:18] <Bouldus> go 40 vit so you can be backstabbed with the strongest weapon twice and still not die
[5:35:25] <+keksisblyat> I hate math
[5:35:36] <DuoScratch> I couldn't do that. I couldn't put a stat at 27...OCD would not allow for a number that isn't divisible by 5.
[5:35:47] <Animeshowfan> scienceing this bitch up
[5:35:47] <+jyrecko> get ready for the gonkers
[5:35:49] <%peppertimelady> everyone is speakinh such weird language with your min max & your scaling

[5:36:10] <%SolitudeOtM> What level are you going for? @AngriestPat
[5:36:17] <%ribboons> I think their name was saaaaaaa
[5:36:20] <+ricotez> but 27 is awesome from a mathematical perspective because it's a prime number
[5:36:21] <MrPedrovsky> @angriestpat hey pat just got into high rank in my first MonHun(World) what do????

[5:37:23] <%johnny_gogo> Do the best friends even record on holidays
[5:37:28] <urkleturtle> i usually go for the spellsword in every game i play, but somehow in souls i always gravitate to the big heavy hitters
[5:37:29] <%johnny_gogo> i cant remember
[5:37:34] <Tampaoster> we have to see someone use the seed of the giants to fuck up pat as an invader
[5:37:35] <+clifin> @terrawraith Doesn't he want to live forever?
[5:37:50] <%ribboons> wait how are you gonna stream dolls if you stream till 7 am
[5:38:00] <AMajorTom> @ricotez it is the third cubic number though 3^3
[5:38:07] <TerraWraith> @clifin That's oh, that's the point for me. He will be reincarnated as a toilet.
[5:38:16] <+jyrecko> I-framed the frostbite

[5:40:14] <+keksisblyat> Can’t wait for Sekiro, hope it has a twist like Bloodborne going from Victorian horror to CTHULU
[5:40:25] <CloudCircus> Was he worried about his K/D?
[5:40:36] <Hydrapissed> lol
[5:40:44] <Agent_Sampson> can't lose those bp
[5:40:53] <%SolitudeOtM> That sentance did not have Pat in it lol
[5:40:58] <Bouldus> souls dont matter after lvl 30
[5:40:59] <TerraWraith> People who care about K/D more than trying are already losing
[5:40:59] <Animeshowfan> k d??? killer dick?
[5:40:59] <CloudCircus> Lol
[5:41:05] <%Tredecian> you kicked it over
[5:41:09] <+jyrecko> Players don't get penalised nearly enough for DC'ing
[5:41:15] <Bouldus> boss souls will barely give you a lvl after 30
[5:41:24] <Hydrapissed> heavy attacks flip the lizards over
[5:41:27] <%ribboons> Sekiro will be like Bloodborne except it goes from Japanese ninja stuff too alien cowboys from Jupiter attacking the main character
[5:41:41] <+Foobe> hushed, one last time
[5:41:43] <+edited156> PAT GO TO BED IT'S ALMOST SIX AM JESUS
[5:41:44] <TerraWraith> @ribboons That sounds amazing.
[5:41:47] <+keksisblyat> Would be super down with that
[5:41:48] <DuoScratch> Ya know, Horus's room would make a great arena.

[5:42:04] <RichAnvils> Lewd Ellen Shield Kreygasm
[5:42:06] <%Tredecian> @Hydrapissed after he flipped he accidently kicked and flipped it back on its legs
[5:42:13] <Bouldus> sekiro is secretly an armoered core game
[5:42:13] <%SolitudeOtM> It's the best small shield
[5:42:15] <Hydrapissed> good stats and absoarb for small shield
[5:42:17] <Piiavc> decent small shield
[5:42:19] <+RushUnplugged> it's a good parry shield
[5:42:19] <%ribboons> not as good as the moaning shield
[5:42:21] <Piiavc> good for parrying
[5:42:23] <Hydrapissed> small shield = best parries
[5:42:27] <%ssjklyco> Happy Streamsgiving
[5:42:32] <RichAnvils> it and iron round are best for parrys
[5:42:33] <%FackinCrazy> Its good all around but not great
[5:42:43] <Hydrapissed> yeah iron round and that
[5:42:47] <%king_strongstyle> For your favorite style royalgaurd
[5:42:48] <%ribboons> yeah mid way through your ninja jumps into a mystical samurai mech
[5:42:53] <+jyrecko> aka how to show your opponent that you intent to pary
[5:42:56] <Bouldus> its also quite nice looking, which is infinitely more important then how good it is
[5:43:00] <Mujihi> whats really important about llewelyn shield is that its great fashion
[5:43:03] <%FackinCrazy> Pat you gonna use Smougs hammer ?
[5:43:04] <+keksisblyat> THATD BE SICK

[5:48:00] <harraceharrison> I think they underestimated how many people would just run past the worm
[5:48:03] <Animeshowfan> this seems really unfair
[5:48:06] <TerraWraith> There is 1 non-violent crabbo. Do not hurt him
[5:48:06] <kvassimoto> Crab battle!
[5:48:14] <Kyuubi300> time for crab

[5:49:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 49m 3s.
[5:49:02] <%SolitudeOtM> I think only DS2 in unfair
[5:49:11] <%ribboons> wait I got it. In sekiro it is revealed that the true enmy of the game is the crabs from ds3, so to defeat them you must climb into your cowboy mecha and use your stand to challenge them to a card duel and then defeat them with your secret weapon Guts from naruto
[5:49:18] <chiglit> U gonna check out the ring you picked up?
[5:49:18] <%Tredecian> @simpleskeleton fucking clap man
[5:49:19] <%speedwagen> did they explore this area in the lp?

[5:50:12] <ArtooKilledYou> My first run of this, this area was a night@are
[5:50:18] <TerraWraith> So this is out of the blue. Does anyone here remember Xena Warrior Princess?
[5:50:26] <%speedwagen> YES!
[5:50:27] <MattPlainview> The Demon Ruins always felt like a scrapped version of Chalice Dungeons.
[5:50:27] <MESeele> Yup
[5:50:29] <kvassimoto> yes
[5:50:32] <%speedwagen> xena was sick

[5:50:49] <%Arxel1> Xena was dope
[5:50:51] <Hydrapissed> xena the she male warrior
[5:50:54] <+keksisblyat> Ye there are a shit ton of invisible walls in this area
[5:50:56] <%speedwagen> it doesnt hold up that well though
[5:50:59] <+RushUnplugged> xena invented lesbians
[5:51:02] <%speedwagen> but its still awesome
[5:51:04] <MESeele> xena's sidekick was cute
