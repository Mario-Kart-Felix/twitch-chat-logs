[0:31:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> Seinfeld sucks ass. if I want to watch dumb white uptown New Yorkers I'd take the train and stand outside a neighborhood
[0:31:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> THE GANG GETS RACIST
[0:31:05] <RunningNGunning> Always Sunny isn't that hard at least for me
[0:31:06] <%Roundelay11> a good show about bad people
[0:31:06] <+machshop> always sunny is too absurd for cringe
[0:31:06] <%trueherobappo> I can't handle Always Sunny

[0:31:08] <+tweedler92> I can't with Louie
[0:31:10] <%EpsilonDSC> always sunny season one is awful to watch
[0:31:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> at least early Watatmote
[0:31:11] <%Dementedpenguin> I've never described someone saying that Always Sunny as being a "hard watch" o_O
[0:31:11] <dukenux> Means i should probably watch Curb
[0:31:12] <%trueherobappo> nope
[0:31:12] <+DarkNerdShawny> Curb isnt funny, Always Sunny is actually funny
[0:31:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Always Sunny seems like too out there. I'm fine with it's cringe
[0:31:19] <Blank9> nathan for you's meta episodes are up there
[0:31:21] <%EpsilonDSC> the rest of the series is fantastic
[0:31:21] <%valriot> Peep Show and other British cringe comedy is rough
[0:31:27] <%Dementedpenguin> *recall
[0:31:29] <+TheStarvingGood> Curb is worse because the shit that happens to Larry could possibly happen to you.
[0:31:30] <rcand9> yess
[0:31:33] <%sporeian94> You clearly have never watched any TLC reality show. Watch the one where the dude is in a gay relationship with his car

[0:49:15] <%RubberFistFight> @majima666 a lot of canned whipped cream uses nitrous oxide instead of CO2 as it's better for some reason (some beers are nitrogenated too, like guiness), and basically you use the can the wrong way round so the gas comes out and the cream doesn't, and you inhale the gas. It's super bad to do and will fuck you up long-term.

[1:04:17] <King_thunder365> A couple days ago during my "History of Rock&Roll" class when my professor mentioned Vaudeville and Minstrel shows and blackface, I immediately started to grin and IMMEDIATELY covered my mouth because I was laughing like crazy in my head because I was thinking about those blackface jokes from that Omikron LP. I kept saying to myself: "OH GOD, NO! FUCK FUCK, DON'T LAUGH EVERYONE'S GONNA THINK YOU'RE A HUGE RACIST!" Luckily, I made it through the class without bursting out laughing.

[1:17:05] <%RubberFistFight> Cats shouldn't eat chocolate, for the same reasons dogs shouldn't, but the icing probably has very little chocolate in it and it's like milk chocolate, not dark, meaning it's safe.

[1:18:07] <tusk102> oh no
[1:18:08] <%RubberFistFight> Cats and dogs can't process a compound called "theobromine", it's highly toxic to them. However white chocolate has 0 in it because it doesn't have cocoa solids in it, and milk chocolate only really has enough solids to make it brown and vaguely cocoa-y flavoured. Dark chocolate is the one you really want to keep away from them.

[1:21:36] <+TaylOctopus91> All Pat had to do to save Elmo was let Peach feed him her muddy pie.
[1:21:43] <Fujiwara_92> elmo ate a hole cake by himself
[1:21:44] <sniffy77> I can't believe elmo ate the entire tolberone mountain
[1:21:48] <+Seitine> They do. My friends cats will actually harass her for milk, ice cream, and whipped cream if they know she has it. Little asses.
[1:21:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> I can't beleive elmo realized pat is made of chocolet and anger and ate all of him
[1:21:53] <%InugamiTheHound> centipede AIDS!!
[1:21:54] <%sporeian94> Stream Cancelled Elmo has to get emergency mud pie stomach pump
[1:21:59] <%RubberFistFight> @DesertPenguin it's important to be specific when you say "cats = no chocolate" though, because like I outlined before, it's the amount of cocoa solids that determines the risk, since that's what contains the theobromine that's toxic to them. White chocolate = 0 solids, so 0 risk. Milk chocolate = around 5% max, so still not really a big deal. Dark chocolate? Big no-no.
[1:22:16] <+DesertPenguin> Yes, I heard that Dark Chocolate is really bad
[1:22:19] <%Coystick> BIG FIGHT
[1:22:20] <+DesertPenguin> otherwise no major worries

[1:22:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It was just a bit awkward when the tone shifted to "I don't know, so I'll raise my voice ." I'm guilty of it so is my family
[1:22:22] <%D3rrtyD4n> dark chocolate is
[1:22:24] <worldbrand> cats can have little a salami
[1:22:25] <+necrocannibal2> for people who forgot this story
[1:22:25] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> I can't believe Elmo flew to Switzerland and ate all the chocolate in the whole country.
[1:22:26] <Oxybe> Elmo eating the boom mike was totes cray cray.
[1:22:31] <+Diabetic> Honestly if it's milk chocolate the cat is more than fine
[1:22:31] <+DesertPenguin> Dark Chocolate is almost toxic to dogs, right?
[1:22:33] <%JJCheeker> My dog got into a bunch of chocolate she was fine
[1:22:33] <caja_de_ojos> can't belive pat is actuly Rich Evans
[1:22:39] <+Diabetic> My stupid pug ate chocolate and I freaked the fuck out

[1:22:54] <JonEWorldbeater> You realise one of these days Elmo is gonna walk on the keyboard and domestic violence will be made public.
[1:22:57] <%RubberFistFight> @DesertPenguin nah the same rules apply for dogs, for the same reason. It's something to do with the liver enzymes in small mammals.

[1:23:06] <+OwlLightningMage> This is a long ass beating
[1:23:07] <$joylent_blue> dogs are notoriously weak to chocolate attacks
[1:23:07] <%LunarRemix> I don't it's chocolate as much as it's the cocoa fruit.
[1:23:16] <+Diabetic> I'm pretty sure we got some chastity belt cock and ball torture off camera occurring

[1:24:29] <Fujiwara_92> elmo realised he's made of chocolate so he ate himself
[1:24:34] <%SolverCODO> Paige is probably anxious crying and Pat is comforting her if I had to guess
[1:24:36] <+orion_248> Pats giving her the ol razzle dazzle while Elmo watches.
[1:24:40] <linklol321> it's gonna come back and it's just gonna be Paige saying isn't feeling to well and will have to end the stream earlier
[1:24:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Peach is beating the shit out of Pat

[1:24:56] <cureneckbeard> elmo fine don't worry
[1:25:02] <%SWFanatic> Elmo doesnt like it
[1:25:03] <%RubberFistFight> I don't begrudge them making sure Elmo is ok. Like, they love him to bits, he's super important to them, so his safety is a priority. It's fine, I'm the same with my cats.
[1:25:04] <@StridentSong> All confrontations will end with the angry sexy times
[1:25:07] <%draugrix> I can't believe Elmo ate the multiverse
[1:25:08] <$joylent_blue> Paige we, the chat, with our infinite knowledge, have determined that Elmo is probably super fine

[1:30:36] <%michingmallecho> Paige is stressing if Elmo ate a little or ALOT of chocolate by accident and I understand
[1:30:39] <cureneckbeard> pat and paige are eating all the chocolate in the house to stop elmo eating it
[1:30:39] <%RubberFistFight> @rainium93 Elmo was naughty and was licking some chocolate mudcake for a few seconds before they noticed. Paige is now concerned because of the "chocolate is bad for cats" thing, but in this case it's fine since cake icing contains very little of the bad stuff in general, unless it's one of those super-gourmet ones that's just like solid dark choc all the way through.
[1:30:40] <thechainsawyer> I hope they’re okay

[1:34:00] <+DRAGKUDO> always thought the chocolate being poison was only for dogs.
[1:34:02] <%WhereIsWill> Pat must summon the FINAL NUT to save the stream
[1:34:02] <%PerrinIsDead> He is big and stronk
[1:34:03] <%EndlessScrapper> Chocolate is very dangerous for cats. Luckily most things advertised or taste like chocolate actually contain very little of it. You have to get into expensive cuisine to get real full chocolate.
[1:34:03] <%Intersceptre> Pat's giving Paige his Bougee Spoogee
[1:34:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> PAT STARES AT FINAL
[1:34:10] <cureneckbeard> elmo is everyone's cats
[1:34:11] <+DRAGKUDO> didn't know it included cats too
[1:34:24] <$joylent_blue> chocolate is bad for most animals iirc
[1:34:24] <%lockbreaker> apatBougie
[1:34:29] <+MiniatureGames> finally beat great shinobi owl!
[1:34:29] <DarkKiores> So what happen?
[1:34:32] <%PerrinIsDead> Every time I look at my cat and think about how he’s gon die someday I get fucking depressed
[1:34:34] <VioletRosefall> did Pat die?
[1:34:38] <%D3rrtyD4n> you all are crazy, the cat is fine

[1:34:40] <+DRAGKUDO> Pat is dead
[1:34:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @FirearmsInstructor Very minor. Didn't mean to oversell it with the word lash. Couldn't find the words
[1:34:44] <%isolex_> @DarkKiores Elmo got into paige's mud pie
[1:34:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PerrinIsDead Dont worry, so will you
[1:34:46] <%Taisuru> Stream cancelled due to cat treats
[1:34:48] <%lockbreaker> @perrinisdead dude that's heavy
[1:34:48] <+keyoray> Chocolate is actually poison to most animals, :/
[1:34:50] <butthurtdave> Plot Twist: pat came back five minutes ago but still hasn't figured out he hasnt changed the stream back yet
[1:34:52] <Neo_Kaiser> Paige caught Pat eating chocolate.
[1:34:54] <%RubberFistFight> @EndlessScrapper yeah. Something like Lindt 70% cocoa dark choc? Bad news. Cadbury milk choc? That's BARELY chocolate. White choc? Totally risk free as it only has cocoa butter, not solids.
[1:34:54] <%trueherobappo> I just ordered a pizza, not lets see if it gets here before he gets back.
[1:34:55] <%botchdogg> apatCanada_RA
[1:34:55] <%without_borders> I have a 3yo Akita and if anything happened to her I would through my girlfriend out a window
[1:34:56] <%juxtest> Elmo ate Pat
[1:34:58] <%kewlmyc> Did they die?
[1:34:58] <%honeyman18> Pat should have eaten the cake
[1:35:00] <$joylent_blue> no Pat is fine, Paige is just having some anxiety and they're trying to work through it
[1:35:02] <%miguelrod777> Elmo is now the homeowner after pat and Paige died
[1:35:08] <%PerrinIsDead> @lockbreaker He’s just so stupid and I love him
[1:35:09] <yourliteraldog> well time drink fam
[1:35:11] <antsrandomlife> first time to catch a stream live and this happen. Jesus hope Elmo okay
[1:35:20] <HFxBx> Yep

[1:35:35] <%PerrinIsDead> @xerosigmaprime but I will PROBABLY??? Outlive him
[1:35:35] <%EndlessScrapper> My dog once ate my entire birthday cake and we panicked. Turns out a wally world bought chocolate cake isn't that toxic. He still threw it up because of course he did
[1:35:37] <%Tearonex> Excessive amount of human food is bad, a little bit of frosting is no real need for concern
[1:35:41] <+MeatClackin> VoHiYo
[1:35:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RubberFistFight Yea, isnt White choco just sugared saturated fat?
[1:35:42] <%mield916> oh no

[1:35:49] <+Eddy21forsaken> elmo ate food, now is a Great One and is consuming Canada
[1:35:49] <tusk102> pat already said elmo is fine, it's just that paige is freakin out
[1:35:51] <ShineTheDiamond> @joylent_blue :D True. They will work through it!
[1:35:53] <$TheSurfinSlayer> Pat is probably having even more sex with Paige
[1:35:55] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is dead
[1:35:56] <Fujiwara_92> VoHiYo
[1:36:00] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige killed him
[1:36:00] <Ran196> VoHiYo
[1:36:03] <VioletRosefall> wait, what happened to Elmo?
[1:36:05] <%Intersceptre> like Paiges hitbox for emotions starts up super fast but lingers
[1:36:06] <+tweedler92> I was today years old when I found out chocolate is bad for cats
[1:36:08] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> For those just arriving. Pat: not dead. Elmo: adorable; ate some stuff he shouldn't have to get back at Pat for shooing him away. Paige: on her LVL 3 meltdown super.
[1:36:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige beat the shit out of Pat for this
[1:36:12] <worldbrand> "I just need to calm her down guys," he thrusted
[1:36:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Elmo licked food
[1:36:15] <%MoulesFritz> pat is making paige a new baby to replace the old one
[1:36:20] <cureneckbeard> ^
[1:36:21] <%the_vedo_show> @VioletRosefall ate a little mud pie
[1:36:23] <%PerrinIsDead> @lockbreaker Ahh sorry to hear that man, it’s always rough. I lost my 15 yo cat who I had since I was literally a baby and that was sad
[1:36:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @violetrosefall he licked a donut
[1:36:25] <%RubberFistFight> @XeroSigmaPrime yup. Proof of that is if you ever buy some solid cocoa butter to put in soap. You'll have a real hard time convincing yourself it's not edible.
[1:36:26] <$joylent_blue> VioletRosefall he licked a bit of chocolate, Paige is worried about it but its wasn't enough to be harmful
[1:36:28] <Oxybe> @violetrosefall he ate a bit of mudpie, paige anxiety, pat calming her
[1:36:33] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige is beating Pat's ass for letting Elmo eat a pound of chocolate
[1:36:36] <VioletRosefall> oh sheet
[1:36:41] <%WhereIsWill> It's either violence or sex with you lot apatWhat
[1:36:42] <ShineTheDiamond> @VioletRosefall He ate some cream off of Paige's mud pie. Cat's are lactose intolerant, and Elmo already has a sensitive health issues.
[1:36:43] <%Albadabar> Elmo is alright but Paige is apatBig worried about him so Pat's helping her out
[1:36:43] <artoflec> AngriestPat (Final)

[1:39:40] <%RubberFistFight> @FirearmsInstructor cocoa butter is a good ingredient for soap since it helps the soap make a really hard bar that doesn't disintengrate in the shower, as well as having a bunch of positive effects for your skin, like moisturising it. Also it smells good.
[1:39:42] <+Estuko> I hope everything's okay

[1:40:32] <FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight Oh yeah I have cocoa butter for my skin. My sister introduced me to it. I don't use it that often, but I didn't follow you earlier message.
[1:40:34] <+AlastorSlain> one time when i was skipping school as a kid the day ended in me and my best friend making a fireball
[1:40:36] <%PerrinIsDead> Cops gonna try and get my crops
[1:40:38] <%SolverCODO> Pat hates when we raffle in his chat

[1:40:45] <ShineTheDiamond> @RubberFistFight Ah. My bad. Didn't Pat say just yesterday that Elmo doesn't eat human food? Lul
[1:40:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight never tried eating it? Is it ok to consume? I mean it smells nice.

[1:40:48] <%draugrix> @bread_assassin it's what we do when Pat is away

[1:40:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> My story is food services like Hello Fresh are ok. At least I can find new stuff to make. Kidney beans with bell pepper is one thing I wouldn't have tried before
[1:40:51] <%PerrinIsDead> My day was alright though, one guy, thanks for asking
[1:40:52] <+Seitine> He's standing in line to get Paige some weeds.
[1:40:53] <%LunarRemix> I remember when my cat ate some soap and we had a little panic situation
[1:40:53] <TheArrow_> i went and got food and past is still dead so that's probably not good

[1:41:06] <+DesertPenguin> This is taking too long
[1:41:08] <$joylent_blue> the !raffle command is often used to hold raffles in twitch chats, Pat has never used it but one day ppl started spamming it to troll, it became a meme etc.
[1:41:08] <%CrimsonCore90> Is this a they stream?
[1:41:10] <%spitelite> apatRaffle
[1:41:10] <%RubberFistFight> @FirearmsInstructor no you would not want to eat it. It's still saponified fat so it would taste like absolute shit and probably make you kinda ill.
[1:41:11] <ricky12k> Well for me currently looking for a new car going get it after Valentine’s Day.

[1:41:31] <%trueherobappo> Like, it's been more than five minutes..
[1:41:31] <cureneckbeard> this is pat's fault for not eating the cake
[1:41:31] <%EndlessScrapper> My Mom who I love dearly and is a great mother had one bad parenting moment when I was a kid. We paid a stranger to cut down a tree in our front yard and gave him our chainsaw. She was worried he would steal it if we didnt watch him so she asked me to watch him while she went got us some drinks. Me, a 10 year old unarmed child, making sure the grown man with a chainsaw doesn't try anything.
[1:41:32] <tusk102> @cham52 @nofestu2 Pat already said he is ok
[1:41:34] <%CrimsonCore90> boo.
[1:41:34] <%SilverFaustX> at this point i only need to know if elmo is ok
[1:41:36] <Fujiwara_92> boo to ppl explaining raffle
[1:41:37] <jo_vo> In all seriousness: Hope Elmo is OK.

[1:41:47] <%PerrinIsDead> All I did was finally square away my college debt for a semester I didn’t withdraw from in time and owed the school a few grand for two years. Missed the semester start deadline by a week though
[1:41:49] <+lucaflow> Wait what happened
[1:41:50] <yourliteraldog> Fun fact Whipits are sometimes called hippy crack
[1:41:54] <%Order_of_Mystery> what happened?
[1:41:54] <%RubberFistFight> @FirearmsInstructor unless you mean the cocoa butter ITSELF. Technically it's not for eating but there's nothing stopping you since it's more or less unsweetened white chocolate LUL
[1:41:57] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Paige is still at about a 9. Stream cannot return until Paige is at a 4, which will be tough, as Paige's natural state is like a 6.5.
[1:42:00] <+AlastorSlain> i have to have the open part of a can facing me when it is on a table or i can't concentrate on anything else
[1:42:05] <tusk102> @lucaflow elmo licked some cake and paige freaked out

[1:42:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight Would you mind elaborating what you meant by "you would have a hard time convincing yourself it's not edible"? (I'm paraphrasing your exact message to Xeno)
[1:42:09] <%CrimsonCore90> Pat fell into the toilet! apatGoblin apatGib
[1:42:12] <+Eddy21forsaken> they're probably calling a vet to see if elmo will still be BIG and STRONG

[1:42:33] <%Ranryu692> Elmo maybe ate some chocolate cake
[1:42:35] <+lucaflow> Elmo should be fine if that's the case
[1:42:37] <sniffy77> elmo ate some mud pie. cat parents are parenting
[1:42:37] <Badgerconda_> Pat's balls fell eeeeverywhere.
[1:42:37] <armandolorian> Elmo is probably calling PETA

[1:42:47] <%PerrinIsDead> @endlessscrapper Just how it was back in the days of old before helicopter parents

[1:42:50] <$joylent_blue> suikudo Elmo got at some chocolate but he's fine, Paige is a bit worried tho
[1:42:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @suikudo elmo licked pie frosting, paige anxiety went up
[1:42:51] <linklol321> at this point i think that Pat is hiding behind the couch because he doesn't want to play RE0
[1:42:52] <+lucaflow> Oh he should be fine
[1:42:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @FirearmsInstructor HEY ITS XERO, NOT XENO! RACIST
[1:42:54] <%Ranryu692> they probably have to induce vomiting, and then deal with that
[1:42:56] <tusk102> and again pat already said he's fine
[1:42:59] <+machshop> why isn't there a cat DEA that raids for catnip
[1:43:01] <%silverira> Man wtf I went to make some pudding and I'm back and the Stream still on hold
[1:43:01] <+lucaflow> Maybe scheduale a vet visit just in case
[1:43:01] <%lockbreaker> it was just the whipped creme the cat will be fine

[1:43:04] <FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight wait are you saying I was rubbing fat on my face? LUL
[1:43:04] <+AlastorSlain> when i shave i have to get all hair off of my face to the point of making my skin sore
[1:43:06] <+DesertPenguin> @AngriestPat The cat is fine
[1:43:09] <%RubberFistFight> @FirearmsInstructor ok so i meant the cocoa butter block itself, because it looks and smells exactly like a bar of white chocolate, has the same consistency and texture, and is actually the biggest ingredient IN white chocolate. But lacking all those other ingredients, it doesn't taste good at all.
[1:43:09] <+Eddy21forsaken> pat poisoned elmo to avoid playing RE0
[1:43:12] <jo_vo> Pat said Elmo had been "eating it (mudpie) for awhile" so time will tell

[1:46:44] <%Rngiddion> tear off the bandaid pat
[1:46:44] <%suikudo> Chat has pat not even started playing?
[1:46:45] <chronoxgp> elmo is too furry to be lactose intolerant

[1:46:46] <+Eddy21forsaken> anything to avoid RE0
[1:46:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> RE0 is forever.
[1:46:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestPat the longer you put off re0, the longer you're putting off re6
[1:46:47] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat God gave you a "get out of RE 0 pass" and you choose to ignore it

[1:47:01] <%JJCheeker> Elmo take care of yourself
[1:47:03] <+AlastorSlain> you are doing a good job pat
[1:47:04] <%asgard147> apatPorgmo
[1:47:05] <+conradical> the longer it takes you to get through RE0, the longer til you play some good RE games
[1:47:11] <Neo_Kaiser> You can get out of RE0 if you eat enough chocolate to make you sick.
[1:47:15] <JonEWorldbeater> Cat is dumb but still smarter than peoples
[1:47:16] <+OhioNitsud> billy is calling for you pat. come back to billy
[1:47:19] <%sporeian94> Cat's have no sense of taste why would he know
[1:47:21] <%Albadabar> So I recall you saying CVX was way worse than RE:0, do you still feel that way after replaying a bit of 0?
[1:47:22] <%StaceMcGate> I want to bring up CrazyTalk, last night Pat said cats will not things that are bad for them
[1:47:24] <chainedwolfstress> Kitties unfortunately don't have the brain power to put 2 & 2 together. :P
[1:47:24] <%miguelrod777> same
[1:47:25] <%Dementedpenguin> My favorite part of the pause was people saying Elmo ATE the cake LUL

[1:47:32] <+machshop> that's bullshit
[1:47:33] <+hrudzie_1> fuck no
[1:47:33] <%RubberFistFight> Cats arent attracted to chocolate because it's chocolate, it's because it's dairy-based.
[1:47:33] <QuiescisAnima> "We have purposely trained him wrong, as a joke."
[1:47:33] <graemecrackers1> CoolCat
[1:47:34] <%SilverFaustX> they do
[1:47:34] <cureneckbeard> it's pat who has no sense of taste
[1:47:35] <+Eddy21forsaken> they eat their poo and pee
[1:47:36] <%crimsonharvest> cats cant taste sugar like we can
[1:47:36] <StalwartZephyr> no sweets
[1:47:36] <chainedwolfstress> Neither do dogs for that matter..
[1:47:37] <%sporeian94> they can tell like really bitter
[1:47:37] <%Jekado> they can't taste sweet
[1:47:37] <DuoScratch> that is BIG NOT TRUE!
[1:47:37] <+hrudzie_1> thats total shite
[1:47:39] <%LunarRemix> Cats don't taste sweet. Some do but it's rare.
[1:47:39] <chronoxgp> elmo is too furry to be lactose intolerant
[1:47:39] <+DesertPenguin> No cat's can taste
[1:47:39] <%Chatterbox1991> thats Dogs pat
[1:47:39] <Fujiwara_92> he's you son, so nah
[1:47:39] <WaxWitch> why do pets try their best to die? stop eating everything!
[1:47:39] <%lockbreaker> cats can't taste sweets
[1:47:41] <+keyoray> No sense of taste, confirmed
[1:47:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @JonEWorldbeater Elmo is actually handicapped with brain stuff
[1:47:42] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> to be fair, if chocolate made me throw up I'd still probably eat chocolate sometimes
[1:47:42] <%peachy996> Cats like your earwax dude
[1:47:43] <+ZephynM> I am pretty sure cats can taste. Mine LOVE soft food
[1:47:44] <%PerrinIsDead> THEY TOTALLY TASTE
[1:47:45] <worldbrand> of course they can taste, they can smell
[1:47:46] <%Albadabar> apatWrong
[1:47:46] <+Jonesman64> cats cant taste sweet

[1:47:48] <SiGBlitz> 'TIS TIME TO CRITIQUE apatBougie_TK apatBougie_TK
[1:47:48] <%lionandfox21> They do have a sense of taste just not sweet
[1:47:48] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Cats are genetically incapable of tasting sweet. It was bred out of them long ago.
[1:47:50] <+machshop> my cat was picky as shit about his food
[1:47:50] <JackKrauser> Only DSP tastes salt.
[1:47:50] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> ask Elmo

[1:50:19] <%RubberFistFight> I mean, I don't really wanna say that she used to me attain and secure a financial asset for herself, but she TOTALLY fucking used me to attain and secure a financial asset for herself.
[1:50:20] <+DesertPenguin> Nope
[1:50:22] <RinkuTheFirst> Poor Elmo; this must be so stressful for him
[1:50:30] <%Shadicara> Can't escape the crate of fate
[1:50:32] <+wvuboii> Now what?
[1:50:32] <+DesertPenguin> Seriously @RinkuTheFirst The cat is fine
[1:50:33] <graemecrackers1> Crate of holding
[1:50:37] <%miguelrod777> everyone over it one way or another calm down penguin
[1:50:37] <roundii> Pat isn't a good business bc he let's his wife take the cat to the vet
[1:50:38] <Mnightshyamallama> Man I hope the surprise is RE4
[1:50:39] <WaxWitch> any proper parent would, even if it's nothing ya know?
[1:50:40] <corepercentlives> tldr pat poisoned elmo because he hissed at him
[1:50:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @DesertPenguin LUL
[1:50:40] <%templar010> @AngriestPat For real if you want to put off RE:0 grab Savage Planet, looks like it would be your shit and its hilarious
[1:50:40] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Serious question, is vet stuff covered by Canada? Or is it possible a trip to the doctor is cheaper than a trip to the vet? That would feel so odd
[1:50:40] <%Hiro01231> What's your point @DrFacilier
[1:50:41] <%vaporousTippler> I guess chocolate was the real Biohazard Zero all along.
[1:50:41] <%lionandfox21> @RubberFistFight Bro you holding out okay?
[1:50:42] <%Dementedpenguin> This has to be the greatest cliffhanger since the TNG two-parter Kappa
[1:50:43] <+conradical> cat battle
[1:50:44] <%draugrix> @suikudo not one single Vidya game has been olayed
[1:50:45] <%Binary_Fireball> why are there crazy people in chat?
[1:50:46] <Oxybe> ELMO SHALL NOT BOW TO YOUR CAGE. ELMO IS BAG AN STRONG.
[1:50:46] <+hrudzie_1> and now the cats gonna suffer for no reason lmaoo
[1:50:52] <%PerrinIsDead> If you care about games being played in a timely manner please find a different stream
[1:50:52] <+Breaknoon> What happened?
[1:50:53] <%suikudo> Amazing!
[1:50:58] <armandolorian> chocolate wasted
[1:50:59] <RinkuTheFirst> @desertpenguin I think it's better for the vet to tell them it's nothing than for them to do nothing and it be something
[1:51:01] <Ghost__Pantsu> What better then a hypochondriac a hypochondriac that owns pets Kappa
[1:51:04] <%Desertfishing> elmo is only gonna have the shits at most he would have to eat A LOT of chocolate depending on his weight
[1:51:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @DesertPenguin well, when you have an older pet and the money, you take no chances is what I can understand
[1:51:14] <%draugrix> @breaknoon Elmo's going to vet for induced vomiting
[1:51:14] <+DesertPenguin> @RinkuTheFirst in most cases I would agree but this is such a nothing
[1:51:20] <+DesertPenguin> I have old cats too, They'd be fine
[1:51:21] <+Shoosler> I don't wanna say the fucked up thing ( Kappa ) but here I go anyways.... LUL
[1:51:22] <WaxWitch> kitty are chocolate dogFeels
[1:51:23] <FirearmsInstructor> I was looking forward to Paige's offscreen verbal shitposting. FeelsBadMan
[1:51:27] <WaxWitch> ate*
[1:51:28] <Oxybe> @breaknoon Elmo ate some mud pie, paige anxious, pat tried to calm her and now she bring elmo to vet
[1:51:31] <%asgard147> "WHY MUST YOU CAGE ME WITHIN THIS FOUL BOX MOTHER? WHY?!" apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[1:51:31] <+DesertPenguin> If you see him throwing up then bring him in and that's it. He's not gonna die if you do nothing
[1:51:32] <%Intersceptre> he's gonnnnnaaa puuuuukeee!
[1:51:35] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Breaknoon had a long talk time and then pat caught elmo licking some chocolate. Paige got worried about her baby and called the vet and got their opinion, which took 25 minutes or so
[1:51:44] <%BalloniWright> "Promise nothing, deliver less" Kappa
[1:51:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> If only PAT LET PAIGE FEED HIM THE PIE
[1:51:45] <+Breaknoon> Thanks!
[1:51:48] <+keyoray> Dude, if the cat is already throwing up, that's not good
[1:51:48] <Fujiwara_92> 55 minutes for wait LETSGO
[1:51:49] <RinkuTheFirst> @sphincter_spelunker Agreed. I have an elderly cat and I don't take chances with him.
[1:51:52] <HFxBx> Pump the cat's stomach? Get me a garden hose, I'll do it for half the price.
[1:51:52] <thetruenicster> So folks, how many bad takes has he had so far?
[1:51:53] <%DensityD> it was cake
[1:51:53] <%Order_of_Mystery> If you are more concerned about the stream beijg delayed than Pat and Paige making sure Elmo the cat is okay, you need to reassess some things. They love that cat, and y'all can afford to be patient.

[1:51:57] <chronoxgp> vet's just jerking their chain
[1:52:00] <%RubberFistFight> @lionandfox21 lol yeah this was like 15 years ago now. Still have the house, the dumb bitch tried to start a court case to get 100 grand out of me to buy her out. So me and my current partner refinanced and the ex got $20K - her initial deposit, plus half the increase in equity. Stupid cow figured a market slump was the right time to strike. Oh well.
[1:52:02] <%Binary_Fireball> woolieREMEMBERS
[1:52:03] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> sugoiSchleep wake me up when he returns
[1:52:05] <%suikudo> So he licked chocolate and didnt eat it?
[1:52:09] <+DesertPenguin> I don't care about the stream being delayed, I care about them being informed animal caretakers
[1:52:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Elmo seemed fine tho
[1:52:13] <RinkuTheFirst> I've personally lived through the "Oh, it's nothing" scenario where it wasn't "nothing"
[1:52:13] <armandolorian> if woolie was a fucking cat for a stream
[1:52:16] <%draugrix> @order_of_mystery agreed
[1:52:20] <%lionandfox21> I dunno I guess when a fur child is involved shit is super stress cause that's how I am with my cats
[1:52:23] <graemecrackers1> Licky licky
[1:52:24] <%DetroitSentai> they dont know if he just licked some or ate it
[1:52:29] <RinkuTheFirst> I'd give any amount of money to have my cat Bob back
[1:52:30] <%Dementedpenguin> @suikudo Pat says he licked it. Some in chat are saying he ate it.... for some reason
[1:52:30] <roundii> it's a free bideo game stream so it's not the end of the world for it to be delayed for worries about cat
[1:52:31] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah but I think the vet visit is more to put Paige at ease if anything.
[1:52:33] <%miguelrod777> to be fair Paige is the one who's worried pat realizes the cats probably fine
[1:52:35] <%Binary_Fireball> they called the vet and the vet was like yea bring him in
[1:52:37] <%InugamiTheHound> WTF pat is still gone?
[1:52:39] <WaxWitch> idgaf cancel it, the baby is more important
[1:52:40] <Fujiwara_92> I 2ould be worried about Elmo, but he's fine... He liked a little frosting, that's all... like geez ppl
[1:52:41] <+DesertPenguin> If all he did was lick it then he's fine
[1:52:42] <%Shadicara> They shall come back with a second cat
[1:52:42] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Better safe than sorry (said canadianly)
[1:52:43] <+AlastorSlain> family comes before stream
[1:52:44] <%suikudo> This all sounds incredibly fucking stupid
[1:52:44] <%Binary_Fireball> not all cats are the same
[1:52:48] <+DesertPenguin> The vet will always tell you to bring him in because money

[1:53:01] <%RubberFistFight> @SoFarFetched which is totally fucking reasonable, as someone who has visited the vet to put my mind at ease several times before.
[1:53:01] <%Shadicara> Can't escape from crossing crates

[1:55:49] <%RubberFistFight> OK guys I'm gonna be honest, if you can't handle a streamer wanting to make sure their partner and their much beloved pet is ok, and you'd rather they just neglect both of them just so they can amuse you, this MIGHT not be the stream for you, since Pat and Paige aren't those types of assholes.

[1:58:06] <tusk102> @King_thunder365 he may have eaten chocolate so they gonna make him puke at the vet
[1:58:06] <%jiin6> Elmo will poop in your shoe
[1:58:09] <ShineTheDiamond> Pat is going to show up with a massive scratch on his face
[1:58:11] <Fujiwara_92> big if true
[1:58:12] <%RubberFistFight> @ShineTheDiamond there's a solid chance they won't actually induce vomiting, since that's pretty fucking traumatic for cats, and unless he ate a large amount of the super-bad type, there's no practical purpose for it.
[1:58:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> phrasing
[1:58:15] <NeroInfinite> Elmo is goign to poop in you

[1:58:24] <%RubberFistFight> @FirearmsInstructor yeah i got a bowl of frootloops
[1:58:25] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Now is the chance to eat tons of chocolate before Paige gets back and you can blame Elmo
[1:58:28] <sniffy77> that sounds wrong
[1:58:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @Sphincter_Spelunker you mean yesterday? Not today.
[1:58:30] <tusk102> @AngriestPat real ass question: why does Wesker want the tyrant so bad if he and Birkin both believe that the G virus is stronger and better than the T virus?
[1:58:31] <Mr_Strut> Is that like a creampie, but with feces?
[1:58:31] <worldbrand> oh that shit's probably hardly chocolate. it's probably 50% wax

[1:58:39] <+Shoosler> that's when you are supposed to calm her down and talk sense into her

[1:59:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Cumong man. That's like a 0.0000001% chance.
[1:59:24] <%Shadicara> Paige will probably behead you too
[1:59:24] <Badgerconda_> you will pay FOREVER.
[1:59:27] <%SilverFaustX> untill u get a new cat
[1:59:27] <%Desertfishing> not your cake though
[1:59:27] <+keyoray> You have to eat all the chocolate now. It's to save Elmo. Best excuse, I mean reason.
[1:59:29] <%RubberFistFight> @Jack_of_No_Trades still wrapped in the foil LUL
[1:59:29] <%Order_of_Mystery> BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY
[1:59:30] <%crimsonharvest> let me tell you about psychology: crazy doesn't care about facts. if all it took was facts i'd have 20 more years of work history than I do.
[1:59:33] <WaxWitch> you never get between a woman and her cat, we will fight u LUL

[1:59:48] <+Flambage> It would take like 4 Mcdonalds to make it up to her @AngriestPat
[1:59:48] <%ssjklyco> also, the irony of on crazy person talking down another crazy person
[1:59:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @Sphincter_Spelunker I missed that part. Was it in the stream? I'll have to go back and watch the vod. I don't know how pre-owned children relates to stalling / delaying. :P Might have missed it.

[2:02:33] <%RubberFistFight> @worldbrand i originally only wanted to romance Takemi, the doctor, but accidentally blundered into a relationship with Kawakami and decided "ah fuck it." Final count was: Takemi, Kawakami, Ohya (i hated myself for that one), Hifumi, Ann and Makoto.

[2:02:46] <%Grayhammatter> what a mansion!
[2:02:49] <%Agami23> theres 2 batteries, this is the weirdest problem with this game
[2:02:50] <cham52> But Pat, who DOESN'T love backtracking
[2:02:51] <+JohnMcClane6194> I beat this game two days ago, you're good
[2:02:53] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Do you only have this transfer problem because you are too good and scrounge a lot? You've beaten games in excess before.
[2:02:53] <+Diabetic> Need Metallica's Battery on loop here
[2:02:58] <majima666> is james hetfield out of rehab yet. i heard he got back on the booze again and checked himself into rehab
[2:03:00] <tusk102> @AngriestPat "get this item from the beginning of the game in a game with no item box where that wouldn't normally matter"
[2:03:02] <%juxtest> But its not THE battery
[2:03:04] <+Scevda> And has paige been present?
[2:03:12] <%spongeofmystery> Battery made out of Empty battery plus acid
[2:03:16] <%CollinsOfBodom> she was lol
[2:03:19] <WaxWitch> RE0 is sucking his life out, i think a lil backseating is fine
[2:03:37] <MayorRev> ***
[2:03:37] <+Scevda> Something happen? @collinsofbodom
[2:03:39] <%RubberFistFight> @worldbrand Kawakami happened because one of the responses was "I'M A MAN AND YOU'RE A WOMAN" and it was too hilarious to pass up.
[2:03:40] <+Shoosler> then we need to blow the life back in him
[2:03:54] <worldbrand> wow
[2:03:55] <%Grayhammatter> sick!
[2:04:00] <+JohnMcClane6194> the slowest puzzle in the goddamn series
[2:04:02] <devanmuse> @angriestpat now that you've played both back to back, which is worse: CVX or RE0?
[2:04:04] <$TheSurfinSlayer> Thank God there's no crimson heads in this
[2:04:05] <MayorRev> @AngriestPat just got back, paige and elmo at the vet?
[2:04:06] <%natebud> He did make a trip back to get 30 handgun rounds and a green herb at one point. Might have overdone it to make his point
[2:04:06] <%SoFarFetched> @Scevda Paige went to take elmo to the vet just in case because he ate some of her mudpie but unsure how much was eaten.
[2:04:10] <%jiin6> this puzzle loves you
[2:04:15] <RinkuTheFirst> Does the RE2 version of the puzzle suck?
[2:04:16] <+Soulbishop> You gotta go down and move the boxes first
[2:04:17] <WaxWitch> NotLikeThis this puzzle
[2:04:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is there a way to do like.... a rolling moveup? Gradually transport things up as you play, rather than a designated trip?
[2:04:18] <+Soulbishop> lol
[2:04:21] <+Shoosler> calebPog doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam
[2:04:22] <+Anonymasque> I swear to fuck I was looking at a auto repair video and pat goes "There's another battery?" as they explain to remove battery.
[2:04:26] <%WhereIsWill> !TOXIC!
[2:04:31] <tusk102> cat vomit is more fun than re0
[2:04:33] <majima666> i think pat said he likes cvx more than 0 now, but both still are quite sucky
[2:04:35] <cham52> Why is there a videogame in my cat vomit stream
[2:04:36] <%CollinsOfBodom> @scevda Elmo ate some of her chocolate pie dessert thing, Paige started freaking out so Pat had to calm her down for like 20 minutes, now she's on the way to the vet.
[2:04:39] <MayorRev> elmo was !POISONED !
[2:04:39] <majima666> to whoever asked

[2:05:16] <%juxtest> Drown the Billy
[2:05:22] <%vaporousTippler> I like to think Elmo is taking Paige to the vet.

[2:05:32] <+Scevda> She needs to not leave food and drink around.
[2:05:41] <Fujiwara_92> I'm on my second p5 playthrough and I'm dating takemi again... I mean how could I not
[2:05:42] <%FacetiousAF> this whole game looks absurdly tedious

[2:05:56] <%RubberFistFight> @OranjSylus man, P5 is a great game. It was starting to lose me towards the end a bit with some of the railroading, but that final fight won me all the way the fuck back.
[2:06:02] <%kingbaconcrispy> Just tuned in
[2:06:04] <+ps4nubian> uncle baby billy
[2:06:05] <%kingbaconcrispy> Pat sounds dead
[2:06:10] <%DonatelloJose> apatRaffle
[2:06:19] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Billy can do IT
[2:06:20] <%kingbaconcrispy> He's only here?!
[2:06:21] <%Grayhammatter> gee, i wonder
[2:06:29] <+chronopaladin> maybe he should sound undead
[2:06:29] <%MoonObscure> hmm
[2:06:30] <worldbrand> what if you had scuba flippers and just walked around everywhere like plat plat plat plat plat
[2:06:31] <%kingbaconcrispy> There's somuch more dead to go!
[2:06:34] <@Fuggins4U> To truly live, Pat must first die.
[2:06:36] <%crimsonharvest> I'm lending you my power
[2:06:37] <%mh9s> you can see his soul escaping
[2:06:37] <%SoFarFetched> @kingbaconcrispy he barely started couple minutes ago.
[2:06:37] <%anticrust> Is it cause he's dead inside?
[2:06:38] <%Desertfishing> it was beckys fault
[2:06:39] <%templar010> Hes loves this game so much his soul resides within it while he plays
[2:06:39] <%RubberFistFight> @Fujiwara_92 Well I mean, Dr Legs tests her boner pills on you and then rubs her tiddys on you to cheer you up. It's understandable.
[2:06:40] <+Eddy21forsaken> does elmo is the live???
[2:06:41] <%templar010> Obviously
[2:06:42] <%crimsonharvest> take my energy
[2:06:45] <Maverick2736> dammit, I hadn't noticed how terribad the footsteps sound until you mentioned it, and now I can't unhear them
[2:06:46] <cham52> How come Pat isn't excited to play arguably the best game in the series
[2:06:47] <%WhereIsWill> BORN TO DIE

[2:13:33] <+JohnMcClane6194> the puzzle is so tedious it makes me feel the life leaving my body
[2:13:36] <devanmuse> should be clockwise or counter clockwise

[2:14:52] <Vitoria90> It looks significantly better though
[2:14:53] <Avalon_One> I'd rather not

[2:15:11] <+Diabetic> glad I waited til Player's Choice
[2:15:13] <%D3rrtyD4n> at least you were guaranteed one good game
[2:15:13] <RinkuTheFirst> Pat, do you think the N64 version of RE0 would have been better?
[2:15:14] <%Black_Machete> Billy,Becky,and Jason are ruined what other can we add
[2:15:15] <%jiin6> my friend had a copy of the twin pack
[2:15:15] <cham52> Was it cheaper??
[2:15:16] <Vitoria90> though it might be because it's a better HD pscale
[2:15:16] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat when you talked to Minh aka Billy did you say "BILLEH" to him?
[2:15:17] <%zedravan> no wonder it killed the classic RE formula for a while
[2:15:20] <trulythedude> okay
[2:15:20] <%StaceMcGate> Can't wait for them to drop the ball on RE8 Kappa
[2:15:22] <%EndlessScrapper> lh
[2:15:24] <%Dementedpenguin> It's also a double-pack for the PS4 LUL
[2:15:26] <%Captainahab_37> all i remember is like an edgelord in a coat sends zombie leeches on a train or something
[2:15:27] <+xdoom_guyx> Yo guys I dont want to spoil but pat is going to open a door
[2:15:31] <%LunarRemix> That's good value for your money though. It's alot of game time.
[2:15:33] <KaiserMario> It's like that double pack with both ***
[2:15:34] <Ran196> my parents refused to get me REmake cause it was a single player game, but they got me RE0 cause i could play with my brother
[2:15:35] <yourliteraldog> Is that an alt costume
[2:15:37] <Ipsenscastle> What if people played them in numerical order though?!?!?!
[2:15:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmmm Wesker Mode
[2:15:43] <%Tenchi_G> I remember, I bought it NotLikeThis
[2:15:43] <%dheng1> Did re0 sales force capcom to turn re4 into an action game?
[2:15:44] <+Diabetic> Fuck you Becky
[2:15:44] <%JJCheeker> First one is the reason why we bought a game cube
[2:15:44] <JackKrauser> Way to do nothing Becky.
[2:15:45] <BurdRightsActivist> Zero good though, it got rid of that pesky system of having to go back to my box constantly. 10/10
[2:15:46] <%jiin6> Bill E
[2:15:48] <%chiluzza> brain realize
[2:15:51] <cham52> Did a b-team do this one or something? Why did they change so many things?
[2:15:52] <nevan0> brain realize....
[2:15:56] <%chiluzza> yes you did
[2:15:57] <FirearmsInstructor> brain realization is important
[2:15:57] <NeroInfinite> brain realize
[2:15:58] <CursedNobleman> becky just watching LUL
[2:15:58] <%Agami23> why no becky shoot?
[2:16:00] <+PolarBear1071> As a modern RE fan, is it worth going back to Remake?
[2:16:00] <$Afterman_> @cham52 yes. different team than remake
[2:16:00] <+Dontfightit> why is the woman not helping?
[2:16:03] <%Grayhammatter> didn't even brain realize
[2:16:04] <%SaiyanShoto> And then they did it again for PS4, Xbox, and Switch LUL
[2:16:05] <zerocruz> Billy scream
[2:16:06] <%Captainahab_37> zombie noises in RE games used to scare the shit out of me as a kid
[2:16:06] <cham52> Becky is supervising
[2:16:07] <Avalon_One> Billy've it
[2:16:07] <majima666> if remake and re0 were on the ps2 then yeah, sales would have been out of the window
[2:16:09] <+JohnMcClane6194> imagine if Crimson Heads were in this game as well
[2:16:12] <BurdRightsActivist> DUDE THE FROMSOFT b-Team did it? PogChamp
[2:16:16] <%D3rrtyD4n> if i ever play this ill look up a speedrun and just get through it as fast as possible
[2:16:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Shinji Mikami HATES Becky
[2:16:20] <%kingbaconcrispy> You were on the puzzle for so long I forgetzombies were here
[2:16:21] <+Diabetic> Why do B-Team's always do the worst shit?
[2:16:22] <%Dementedpenguin> I wonder why.
[2:16:24] <tusk102> @AngriestPat would you prefer RE8 to introduce another new virus or explore the E-series more
[2:16:25] <+necrocannibal2> the RE B-team should commit seppuku
[2:16:26] <FirearmsInstructor> ground beef?
[2:16:35] <cham52> the Besident Evil team
[2:16:36] <majima666> they showed off the n64 version in the run up to the remaster release
[2:16:36] <$Afterman_> this was being created alongside remake, thats why b-team
[2:16:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Diabetic Lion king
[2:16:39] <%Laecerelius> There's a reason why they're the B-Team
[2:16:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> naked zombos
[2:16:44] <%StaceMcGate> It's really weird to think of how Capcom had Nintendo exclusives
[2:16:46] <%Albadabar> Does Outbreak still exist in a playable form somewhere? I recall that shit being lit
[2:16:48] <Vitoria90> good ol' buttzombos
[2:16:49] <+코코꾸라> TOS
[2:16:49] <Ipsenscastle> butts
[2:16:50] <FirearmsInstructor> wow I just went to respond to a message and typed here instead of the chatbox LUL
[2:16:51] <%bigdumbidiotguy> big doo doo pee pee
[2:16:51] <JackKrauser> The only thing they did well in this is the Proto Tyrant.
[2:16:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> oh no
[2:16:52] <Fujiwara_92> naked, so stronger
[2:16:52] <%anticrust> Zombass
[2:16:55] <%MoonObscure> sex them
[2:16:55] <%D3rrtyD4n> stupid sexy zombos
[2:16:57] <%Grayhammatter> are you shooting them in the dick?
[2:17:00] <Vitoria90> where does the term zombo come from
[2:17:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> Pervert Zombies!
[2:17:01] <Avalon_One> It's the pleb zombos
[2:17:01] <+PanicSwytch> THE ORIGINAL PROTAGONIST WERE EMO TWINS BEFORE BECKY AND BILLY
[2:17:02] <yourliteraldog> No junk though
[2:17:03] <%Captainahab_37> where did their dicks go?
[2:17:03] <+Soulbishop> Any capcom B-team is trash look at the MHW Iceborne pc port
[2:17:04] <Vitoria90> like where did that start
[2:17:05] <worldbrand> that's a meaty shotgun blast
[2:17:07] <+SpiritOki> Does anyone else hear that low rumbling?
[2:17:09] <yourliteraldog> Ken dolls
[2:17:09] <worldbrand> very splorchy
[2:17:14] <StalwartZephyr> Those are some splorches
[2:17:14] <%bigdumbidiotguy> bitches love yellow
[2:17:14] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat How would you rate this compared to the other bad RE games? Is this better than Dead Aim?
[2:17:15] <shamchimp> Becky with the good gun
[2:17:16] <MachineHead9> LUL
[2:17:19] <%Laecerelius> OOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!
[2:17:19] <BurdRightsActivist> She's like aiming 30 extra degrees above their heads 4Head
[2:17:19] <%JJCheeker> What happens to their cocks?
[2:17:19] <+PolarBear1071> As a new Re fan, with my first being Re4 on the Wii, is it worth going back to Remake?
[2:17:22] <Fujiwara_92> he got u
[2:17:24] <SMuffinMan> That's how you know you're at the end, naked zambos
[2:17:26] <%Laecerelius> With the sneaky bite tech!
[2:17:28] <cham52> The conversation earlier made me think of something
[2:17:31] <+necrocannibal2> @PolarBear1071 hell yeah it is
[2:17:32] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat this game probably has the weakest main villain as well
[2:17:32] <%dheng1> They retracted into their skin
[2:17:34] <Vitoria90> Hell yeah it does @PolarBear1071
[2:17:36] <%Captainahab_37> is it canon nobody in RE has a penis?
[2:17:37] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember when CVX tried to scare you with like 2 or 3 Zombies?
[2:17:38] <%ha2ken> !uptime
[2:17:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 17m.
[2:17:41] <Vitoria90> holds up to this day
[2:17:41] <FirearmsInstructor> @XeroSigmaPrime *pokes you with a stick*
[2:17:43] <lawfulcrocodile_> is Kotor 2 still on the table for the stream?
[2:17:43] <tusk102> @AngriestPat would you prefer RE8 to explore the e-series virus more or would you prefer a totally new virus?
[2:17:45] <cham52> Wouldn't a game with Needle-weilding Hobos be the scariest shit ever?
[2:17:49] <Vitoria90> specially with the HD Upscale mod
[2:17:49] <majima666> @PolarBear1071 if you can handle the tank controls and camera then hell yeah
[2:17:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @FirearmsInstructor WHAT
[2:17:52] <BurdRightsActivist> LEECHES THO
[2:17:54] <%Laecerelius> You don't like Leecharoth?
[2:17:54] <DensityD> moobot lies
[2:18:00] <%natebud> weak to sunlight
[2:18:03] <yourliteraldog> Isn't the last boss a goo pile
[2:18:04] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I bet stomping a zombies head looks like a big bowl of brains
[2:18:09] <majima666> although re4 still has tank controls really
[2:18:12] <Avalon_One> Bug man
[2:18:12] <%Captainahab_37> leech lad
[2:18:13] <Fujiwara_92> I'M LEECH MAN AND I HAVE A LEECH GANG
[2:18:13] <%arcaderabbit48> "I shall sing you the song of me L E E C H E S "
[2:18:15] <Ipsenscastle> Ironically the N64 version would have been better thanks to not having the tech to do character switching or item dropping
[2:18:16] <BurdRightsActivist> @cham52 Needle Weilding Hobos are the enemy and the entire game is about managing your food, which they STEAL
[2:18:16] <+xdoom_guyx> Pat dont want to seem like a dumbass but I still havent finished RE 1 remake
[2:18:17] <%Tracazoid> "Ada, love meeeee!"- Simmons is pretty weak too
[2:18:21] <%Albadabar> I sort of like Leechman in concept, but the execution wasn't great
[2:18:22] <deltakuma009> is re4 next on the list?
[2:18:22] <+Tumpatill> Man, this game could have been so SICK......
[2:18:26] <%StaceMcGate> Song of Leeches is CRAZY FLUTe
[2:18:30] <+domovoid> RE7 feels like you're running through molasses.
[2:18:31] <tusk102> thats sad
[2:18:31] <DracaenaLeaf> Yes Delta
[2:18:33] <ape_hawk> when is this game over?
[2:18:34] <$Afterman_> thats an ok note
[2:18:34] <%bigdumbidiotguy> "what if I get leeches on my bird" - Bubbles
[2:18:34] <%SoFarFetched> @deltakuma009 yes RE4 after this
[2:18:37] <+flarebears> Good to see you Pat, help me do my logic homework and ill give you a kiss
[2:18:38] <%DensityD> two hours of donation reading and mixed stalling. a bit of it was humorous relationship content
[2:18:39] <+Tumpatill> Could have been....
[2:18:40] <%Skittlesoul> Skittlesoul subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Happy 16 months to my favorite ginger goblin. when you get to re5 will you have a co-op buddy? also i can't believe how bad zero and cvx are. keep at it and thanks for all the fish
[2:18:41] <tusk102> that notes sad actually
[2:18:43] <Ran196> always save the last bullet for yourself
[2:18:43] <graemecrackers1> Skrt skrt
[2:18:44] <JackKrauser> The Leech man in Outbreak was better than this.
[2:18:49] <%Laecerelius> Oh man I wonder if we'll be hearing The Flute
[2:18:50] <+PolarBear1071> As a new Re fan, with my first being Re4 on the Wii, is it worth going back to Remake?
[2:18:57] <Hellarussian> Billy is no Steve, but hes pretty cool i guess
[2:19:02] <$Afterman_> @JackKrauser god yes. the hospital leechman was actually terrifying.
[2:19:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @XeroSigmaPrime Still waiting for your.... idk whatever you threatened before neohKiss
[2:19:14] <%bigdumbidiotguy> billy loves monkey doodoo
[2:19:16] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat who is your favorite villain?
[2:19:16] <%Albadabar> Oh right Leechman was in Outbreak too, man they pushed for him hard didn't they?
[2:19:18] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @FirearmsInstructor UWU
[2:19:22] <ape_hawk> can superman see the health spectrums?
[2:19:23] <%jcflyguy> But it's fine tho
[2:19:25] <%natebud> No one's ever really fine
[2:19:28] <BurdRightsActivist> No it's not 4Head
[2:19:28] <%MoulesFritz> no
[2:19:31] <+Scevda> Just read Pat’s tweet, what was the surprise?
[2:19:34] <%FacetiousAF> REmake, yes. 0 and CVX fuck no
[2:19:38] <$Afterman_> i just played it like..3 weeks ago. remake is great
[2:19:39] <%MoulesFritz> tank controls are piss tbh
[2:19:41] <Fujiwara_92> you playing re4 on the Wii pat?
[2:19:41] <%bigdumbidiotguy> just play Umbrella Corps
[2:19:41] <FirearmsInstructor> @XeroSigmaPrime neohRuhRoh neohGoodBoy
[2:19:44] <%StaceMcGate> oh boy
[2:19:47] <tusk102> oh my god
[2:19:47] <%InugamiTheHound> its strange that every other male RE character can mix herbs together and use them but not Billy @AngriestPat
[2:19:50] <Vitoria90> I was replaying REmake yesterday
[2:19:50] <%ha2ken> They're real even if you can't see them...Woolie...
[2:19:53] <%kingbaconcrispy> Don't be a secondary fan. Play Remake. Also 1, 2 ,3 .
[2:19:55] <%bigdumbidiotguy> monkys
[2:19:56] <jinking79> god Re4 on the wii was so broken
[2:19:57] <deltakuma009> guys guys lets all donate for pat to do a tmp run on re4...but only the tmp nothing else!!!!!!
[2:19:57] <%kingbaconcrispy> Avoid cvx and this
[2:19:58] <BurdRightsActivist> REmake no, 0 and CVX all the way PogChamp
[2:19:59] <Fujiwara_92> GG
[2:19:59] <chronoxgp> battletoads
[2:20:02] <rytisone> iced them
[2:20:02] <majima666> i honestly dont mind tank controls. but its a hard sell to release a game like that in 2020
[2:20:04] <%StaceMcGate> that was a very unfair hunter spawn
[2:20:04] <tusk102> wow that went better than expected
[2:20:12] <cham52> Pat whens the Dino Crisis marathon
[2:20:13] <+Soulbishop> Is FF7 bearable without the graphic mods?
[2:20:16] <tusk102> wow
[2:20:17] <%kingbaconcrispy> It's a matter of getting used to it
[2:20:17] <%bigdumbidiotguy> monkys Kreygasm PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:20:19] <+HyraFukit> @deltakuma009 the tmp is a good gun though
[2:20:23] <%dheng1> Which was a better remake? 1 or 2
[2:20:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat I always tell people to play RE5 Lost In Nightmares over CVX. It accomplishes the samething plotwise
[2:20:29] <%JJCheeker> Last save room
[2:20:29] <%MoulesFritz> 2
[2:20:31] <Fujiwara_92> SourPls
[2:20:32] <+necrocannibal2> 1
[2:20:33] <tusk102> @AngriestPat at least it wasn't eliminators
[2:20:34] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @soulbishop yes
[2:20:35] <+JohnMcClane6194> 1
[2:20:35] <%TwinBat> love this save room music
[2:20:36] <yourliteraldog> Play RE with a steel battalion controler
[2:20:36] <x00Leon> 1
[2:20:38] <ape_hawk> yes
[2:20:38] <+MisterCrimson> @Soulbishop depends what you're looking to get out of it
[2:20:38] <+Diabetic> 2 I felt...
[2:20:40] <$Afterman_> both
[2:20:42] <rytisone> 1
[2:20:42] <%peachy996> 1
[2:20:43] <Fujiwara_92> yes
[2:20:48] <BurdRightsActivist> @Soulbishop Alot of the newer releases are pretty touched up, you can do without them, but if you can get the mods they're fine. It's mostly about the dialogue/characters than the visuals anyways
[2:20:48] <cham52> 2
[2:20:49] <%solidousstream> yes
[2:20:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> both
[2:20:51] <chronoxgp> 2 was ok but the game was SPOILED by the media
[2:20:52] <rancidfrancis1> this game does have a great save theme tho
[2:20:52] <%JJCheeker> That's a tough choice''
[2:20:55] <+conradical> i absolutely love RE2Remake
[2:20:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just dead
[2:20:56] <%natebud> Just a friendly corpse
[2:20:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> 1 is more true to the spirt of the original 2 is a nice new direction
[2:20:58] <%mh9s> were i a zombie i also would chill
[2:20:58] <%miakhalifaisoverrated> Music still bangs
[2:20:59] <Ipsenscastle> @flarebears I've never heard of logic class before, how does that work?
[2:20:59] <tusk102> they're sleeping
[2:21:00] <%D3rrtyD4n> my preference is 1
[2:21:01] <%InugamiTheHound> shoot them in the head, double tap them
[2:21:01] <%bigdumbidiotguy> the remake of Resident Evil Wendy's
[2:21:01] <majima666> hey man, they love the save room theme too. dont be an elitist
[2:21:02] <+Soulbishop> Playing with materia combos and being galaxy brain about my fights
[2:21:03] <$Afterman_> they are both amazing in different ways
[2:21:07] <+chronopaladin> zombies need their union-mandated breaks too
[2:21:11] <%dheng1> I feel you guys
[2:21:11] <SilverJakler> this music is nice
[2:21:13] <deltakuma009> but pat hates the tmp ...bwahahahahahahahahahahaaha
[2:21:14] <x00Leon> i just wanted the classic 2 so the remake is meh
[2:21:17] <+Scevda> What was the surprise ala tweet?
[2:21:19] <yficaptions> this safe room music, mm
[2:21:20] <%lionandfox21> I just had an awful quesadilla and life is sad
[2:21:20] <rytisone> 2 is missing variety in A and B scenarios
[2:21:23] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:21:23] <%SoFarFetched> LUL

[2:21:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> doesn't matter.
[2:21:37] <ape_hawk> NERDS
[2:21:38] <TalisKanju> Why is this Save Room theme so GOOD?
[2:21:44] <Avalon_One> Would you be mad if this game got remade next instead of RE:make?
[2:21:45] <+necrocannibal2> this save room theme sucks tbh
[2:21:46] <%asgard147> I see limesThink
[2:21:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> none of that matters

[2:23:04] <%OldOnyx> Paige was just trying to avoid the full force of [crazy talk]
[2:23:04] <+flarebears> @Ipsenscastle its not really a logic class, its called "Computational Structures". we basically learn how to map out the logic that our computer will take. So i need to become a very literal person like @AngriestPat. when analyzing sentences for logical contradictions
[2:23:05] <%nofestu2> kill them all Becky

[2:23:43] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I hated this game when it released and I hate it now
[2:23:43] <+conradical> @AngriestPat you may have answered this last stream, but do you think RE0 would be a really good game if there was an item box?
[2:23:44] <+Remery_> so hot
[2:23:45] <VioletRosefall> Billy shoots if you turn him on. Ok.
[2:23:46] <%DensityD> squish
[2:23:53] <Animal_Farm4> Can you set the Becky to Turbo?

[2:24:01] <Ipsenscastle> @flarebears ahh. That sounds like it would deflate my brain like a bad souffle. Good luck!
[2:24:02] <%Mindtrick_Matt> If you are talking about the Frogs Pat you can just stand still and they go away
[2:24:05] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I kept Becky off until leech queen
[2:24:07] <rytisone> sometimes frog does not appear
[2:24:07] <%lionandfox21> Could use more improves tho
[2:24:08] <%Mindtrick_Matt> No need for wasting ammo
[2:24:11] <ape_hawk> whats even the story of RE0?
[2:24:11] <%D3rrtyD4n> it would be better, still not a fan of this buddy system
[2:24:13] <%asgard147> I see limesThink
[2:24:16] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I think it would be better if they took out Kuja from FFIX
[2:24:20] <majima666> meh, the story is boring for a prequel
[2:24:21] <%SilverFaustX> cant u just drop it on the floor?
[2:24:22] <TalisKanju> So, RE0 worst Resident Evil?
[2:24:23] <Hellarussian> jeez guy
[2:24:24] <+domovoid> leaches are sentient and hate things.
[2:24:26] <%solidousstream> i just played through this got to part and forgot i had her shoot off and i fuuuuuuuckin sucked

[2:24:28] <mesamus> ow
[2:24:30] <x00Leon> ai hates shotguns
[2:24:30] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Becky is nonviolent
[2:24:31] <+Dontfightit> What's the point of the heart beat effect pat?
[2:24:32] <%natebud> Pat was wrong, she shoots when you do
[2:24:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Did Pat ever talk about the Yoko Taro Thigh Signing drama?

[2:24:44] <+Soulbishop> Freya had the better story arc in ff9
[2:24:45] <%Phantomjay> does the ai use up ammo when she shoots?
[2:24:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Monkeyweed21 kinda
[2:24:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat must reload
[2:24:47] <VioletRosefall> Crazy talk activated?
[2:24:48] <majima666> needs more work than an item box. but that would at least put it up a rank or two, maybe above cvx
[2:24:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no
[2:24:51] <tusk102> yes
[2:24:51] <x00Leon> they try to conserve ammo
[2:24:54] <%D3rrtyD4n> and this game is buggy
[2:24:54] <Avalon_One> The Leeches are just jealous of man's ascendancy
[2:24:55] <yourliteraldog> so there not zambos but leach boys
[2:24:56] <%bigdumbidiotguy> isn't the villain in this game just a pile of leeches
[2:24:56] <%natebud> Billy's the one who always shoots
[2:24:57] <TomFrank> Becky had to line up the shot
[2:24:59] <%Agami23> pat, you said she did that in the LP
[2:24:59] <Ultralutherguy> Becky does not shoot until you do, Billy shoots whenever
[2:25:06] <DracaenaLeaf> @Monkeyweed21 That it happened, but not of any drama
[2:25:07] <%StoicMoogle> Shottys have very low fire rate for teammate
[2:25:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what
[2:25:12] <+flarebears> @Ipsenscastle, its not that bad. like if it is raining , i do not go outside. If one is true the other is false
[2:25:14] <RinkuTheFirst> yeah, Rebecca is conservative with her ammo
[2:25:15] <%Grayhammatter> that's... dumb
[2:25:15] <+Jonesman64> uh oh.. crazy talk happened
[2:25:16] <%natebud> becky shoots when you do @AngriestPat
[2:25:17] <+Soulbishop> F

[2:25:18] <%suikudo> YOU TOLD US THAT YEARS AGO!!!
[2:25:19] <+Remery_> she's nervous okay, she's super used to being a pack mule
[2:25:19] <JackKrauser> How did she survive two RE games again..
[2:25:20] <+HyraFukit> Becky only shoots if Birry shoots.
[2:25:20] <cureneckbeard> Becky can have little a shoot, as atreat
[2:25:20] <+TheSaintJohn> Super Becky Hot: she only shoots when you do
[2:25:20] <%mh9s> becky cannot, biologically speaking, shoot
[2:25:21] <%DensityD> apatCrazy apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:25:22] <cham52> Dang it Becky
[2:25:22] <+necrocannibal2> why does it even work that way? LUL
[2:25:24] <FirearmsInstructor> The way Becky shoots that 12 gauge would either launch it backwards out of her hands, or break her finger inside the trigger guard from the recoil.
[2:25:27] <tusk102> @AngriestPat billy's all aggressive and shit. you said this in the lp
[2:25:28] <%takiyami> you talked abou tthis in the LP
[2:25:28] <invisi_bliss> BECKy
[2:25:29] <%ha2ken> Isn't it a waste of ammo if you give Becky the shotgun and she auto shoots?
[2:25:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Monkeyweed21 What Yoko Taro drama?
[2:25:29] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Lemme smash

[2:28:07] <+necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat Code Veronica might be worse but it was way more entertaining to watch lol
[2:28:13] <+Soulbishop> Doesnt someone always throws a rocket launcher to you at the end of an RE game?

[2:28:17] <%Froyuken> Why's Billy lookin' like a Yakuza?
[2:28:17] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Do you think they give Nemesis some backstory in remake? Like how Billeh could be Nemesis?
[2:28:19] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Monkeyweed21 geez man. It's always so called game journalists involved in those dramas(and usually the ones that start them) Can't anyone in the industry get a break from them?

[2:28:51] <%Monkeyweed21> Sexual Intimidation
[2:28:52] <ape_hawk> yeah but why are they naked in the first place?
[2:28:53] <+Soulbishop> Does someone throw you a rocket launcher at the end of RE3 and 4?
[2:28:54] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Cause the Tyrant was the main threat at the end of RE1 so its a throwback to that a nothing else
[2:28:58] <%bigdumbidiotguy> he's basically the Cloud Strife of Tyrants. a failure
[2:28:59] <PkSilent01> do the Tyrent have the Pennis
[2:29:03] <%templar010> teeny nekkid
[2:29:03] <Avalon_One> They were naked because they were filthy peasants that couldn't afford clothes
[2:29:03] <Viaquez> tyrants dont have custom tailors
[2:29:03] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Is that when Umbrella gave them modesty?
[2:29:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cuz they fresh out the tube
[2:29:04] <worldbrand> tyrants can have little a clothes
[2:29:05] <+necrocannibal2> why would they need clothes
[2:29:06] <tusk102> they're test subjects
[2:29:07] <%Agami23> why do tyrants have great asses?

[2:38:02] <TalisKanju> RE0 has the lamest enemies
[2:38:04] <+Mitchellsocks> This game can be summed up as "Thoroughly Unhype"
[2:38:05] <%SuperFineButtHairs> they suck

[2:38:27] <%TOONFOOD> It's always the ones you least expect
[2:38:29] <%Froyuken> This is basically Escape from Bug Island.
[2:38:30] <FirearmsInstructor> @bigdumbidiotguy Hey you stupid largemun! D:

[2:38:47] <yourliteraldog> Why arent you?
[2:38:48] <%Aydarkzero> @chronoxgp don't worry about it
[2:38:50] <TalisKanju> Steve Burnside is scarier than any enemy in this game.
[2:38:51] <FirearmsInstructor> I'm naked.
[2:38:52] <+Navekraith> cult orgy probably
[2:38:53] <Fujiwara_92> naked means stronger
[2:38:53] <%SuperFineButtHairs> where are thier dicks?
[2:38:53] <$QueequegTheater> @yourliteraldog I am
[2:38:54] <%NWR_James> They had clothes on when they got infected
[2:38:54] <FirearmsInstructor> Why aren't you naked?
[2:38:54] <%D3rrtyD4n> which scientist was in charge of pants?
[2:38:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> zombies are superior when nakie.
[2:38:55] <+necrocannibal2> I'm naked right now
[2:38:57] <%ElenaManetta> It's doing movie techniques of demonstrating tension but it doesn't apply to a player vs. a character you're watching
[2:38:58] <tusk102> @AngriestPat for re3make do you think they'll keep the unique gun drops for beating nemesis? I dunno if they will since they function more like mr x who doesn't go down.
[2:38:59] <%dheng1> They hype up bandersnatches
[2:39:00] <%Monkeyweed21> If I get infected Im going nude
[2:39:01] <%Shadicara> Clothes can't survive the virus Kappa
[2:39:01] <majima666> with the moving stuff, or is it just a load of pictures
[2:39:03] <CursedNobleman> @QueequegTheater please, ive googled your ff archive. mind you, i havent read them, but youre trying

[2:39:03] <%dheng1> But they bitches
[2:39:04] <+Nymphonomicon> Someone infected these poor innocent nudists.
[2:39:08] <%SuperFineButtHairs> what did you to thier dicks, pat?
[2:39:08] <$RealThiele> nudity is +1 to reflex save
[2:39:11] <yourliteraldog> Im super nude I dont even got my skin on
[2:39:11] <%bigdumbidiotguy> They should make a game called President Beevil
[2:39:13] <Hellarussian> t-virus cant melt clothes
[2:39:14] <%nofestu2> Its not like their clothes got resurrected!
[2:39:17] <%muetank> Aids? In my centipedes? It's more likely than you think
[2:39:19] <%DeeTrz> maybe they got infected while taking a naked poop
[2:39:20] <%StoicMoogle> It's as if they were meant to produce better quality story devices
[2:39:20] <$QueequegTheater> @CursedNobleman Oh no
[2:39:23] <%natebud> We need to send some scientists to the GAP to pick up some pants for our zombies
[2:39:24] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> >innocent nudists

[2:41:14] <MachineHead9> LUL
[2:41:15] <Hellarussian> Pat would be Steve
[2:41:19] <$QueequegTheater> @CursedNobleman COme on you know its true
[2:41:21] <$RealThiele> steeeeeve
[2:41:22] <+Nymphonomicon> The camera was your enemy all along.
[2:41:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> because Paige is American and knows how to gun?
[2:41:22] <TalisKanju> @stacemcgate mpreg
[2:41:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Rebecca is totally an idealized form of what a woman is to Japan.
[2:41:27] <%InugamiTheHound> so many furries in the chat who loves vore
[2:41:30] <DeltaPangaea> Feet is the worst because foot people get so fucking wierd about it
[2:41:33] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Billy is fucking dumb and he has Nickelback tattoos
[2:41:34] <+Estuko> becky will run off to go do something to your food THEN save you
[2:41:46] <+necrocannibal2> feet people need to be shot on the streets like dogs
[2:41:46] <%StaceMcGate> @TalisKanju Is Mpreg a real thing or something people do for laughs?
[2:41:47] <yourliteraldog> Beck the Ripper is going into rippermode
[2:41:49] <CursedNobleman> @QueequegTheater ill get back to you on that when i bother to play dark souls. im in JRPG purgatory at the moment
[2:41:49] <%SuperFineButtHairs> @Zaphire_Saucypants a moron?
[2:41:50] <WaxWitch> they're all equally horrible
[2:41:51] <%StoicMoogle> who would Elmo be in RE?
[2:41:53] <%solidousstream> pats not super stronk like paige so he wouldnt be able to carr as much
[2:41:57] <Ipsenscastle> Which is the Sonic Dreams collection fetish? That one's the worst of all
[2:41:58] <+DeaconBluesClues> I want to highly recommend everyone revisit the old RE0 LP, as its one of their best
[2:42:02] <%Monkeyweed21> a Pat stop
[2:42:03] <$RealThiele> pat would be sherry
[2:42:12] <Fujiwara_92> unbirth
[2:42:13] <+Remery_> Pat has all kinds of degenerates in his chat, weebs, furries, foot people. armpit folks you name it
[2:42:13] <$QueequegTheater> @CursedNobleman It's very much not a JRPG, just FYI
[2:42:14] <TalisKanju> I have no idea and I am too scared to find out
[2:42:20] <+necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat ass or boobs?
[2:42:21] <yourliteraldog> Sherry Can do shit though
[2:42:21] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @stoicmoogle that one guy with the NY accent in Revelations
[2:42:22] <$TheSurfinSlayer> So this whole game is to explain why she's in the mansion in RE1, right?
[2:42:22] <$RealThiele> elmo is wesker
[2:42:24] <42nfl19> No @AngriestPat the monster energy was inside you all along
[2:42:26] <Vitoria90> assley
[2:42:27] <@commanderclaw> Sherry was born the same year as You Pat!
[2:42:28] <%NWR_James> Let's be real Pat, Elmo is Becky. You're Sherry
[2:42:30] <%Desertfishing> nah elmo is wesker
[2:42:31] <%TomDanksEGOT> Elmo would be Wesker you just dont know
[2:42:32] <yourliteraldog> Ashely
[2:42:32] <%lionandfox21> sherry is cooler
[2:42:32] <%arcaderabbit48> @Ipsenscastle I think a more accurate question is, "what isn't the Sonic Dreams collection fetish"
[2:42:32] <TheArrow_> chat is nemesis
[2:42:33] <%MrDonTacos_> elmo would be RE5 Chris
[2:42:34] <%StaceMcGate> Was Ashely ever mentioned after RE 4?
[2:42:36] <Ipsenscastle> Elmo would be that wolf from 4
[2:42:36] <%peachy996> Elmo sounds like Ashley in distress
[2:42:37] <Fujiwara_92> Shelmy
[2:42:39] <yourliteraldog> Elmo is ashely
[2:42:40] <$RealThiele> STARRRS
[2:42:40] <Plague_bagel> LEEON HEELP
[2:42:43] <+Ilpala> HEEEEEEEELP LEOOOOOOOOOON
[2:42:43] <%bigdumbidiotguy> elmo is basically Moira
[2:42:46] <+DeaconBluesClues> @AngriestPat does elmo have the super super long animation to get up onto the couch like sherry
[2:42:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @TheArrow_ that's pretty good...
[2:42:46] <Oxybe> Elmo does have booty
[2:42:48] <%LunarRemix> So you would eventually have to fuck Elmo?
[2:42:49] <%heroicspiritavenger> @StaceMcGate Isn't she in 6
[2:42:50] <+Scevda> Some people really want to fuck elmo

[2:45:16] <%StaceMcGate> @TheMattman1313 Elmo licked some chocolate and had to go to the Vet
[2:45:17] <olwe123> that's code for guide!
[2:45:18] <%InugamiTheHound> they couldn't give becky a boost for that keycard!!!!
[2:45:25] <Kerisato> 2015
[2:45:26] <Amplificate> I love RE logic. Why not just climb onto the forklift to grab it, instead you need to make dangerous acid and find a dead battery
[2:45:27] <tusk102> @TheMattman1313 so paige freaked out and took him to the vet but is fine
[2:45:27] <%natebud> like 2014?

[2:45:41] <gade177> I think 4 years.
[2:45:41] <Hellarussian> thats like 50 years in LP years
[2:45:42] <+Scevda> In future RE games, there should be consequences for carrying battery acid and other chemicals around and getting attacked and having them spill on you possibly.
[2:45:42] <Fujiwara_92> 5 or 6 years ago
[2:45:42] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat 5 and a half years ago
[2:45:44] <Oxybe> squish

[2:45:47] <%StaceMcGate> "Here lies Pat's Resident Evil 4 skills"

[2:45:52] <%WhereIsWill> it's been 84 years....
[2:45:56] <%takiyami> Not even 5 years ago. It was inlike 2013
[2:45:58] <%Shadicara> Time to return to kick town in RE4
[2:46:00] <+MisterCrimson> If I wanted to watch someone play a game well, I'd only ever watch Max and Speedrunners
[2:46:03] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat you were like, "oh no what if I die in the video game I've beaten 11 times"
[2:46:03] <DeltaPangaea> Bruh

[2:46:12] <Fujiwara_92> it was like 1994 when he played Kappa
[2:46:12] <%ElenaManetta> Pat do you remember that joke on Heavy Rain Part 5 at minute 5:34
[2:46:14] <+DeaconBluesClues> @Scevda so you want every RE game to have the ReMake1 nitoglycerian "puzzle"
[2:46:14] <%WhereIsWill> stream time half the chat wasn't even born yet
[2:46:15] <%ElenaManetta> That was hilarious
[2:46:17] <%ElenaManetta> can you say that joke again
[2:46:31] <$QueequegTheater> SAY THE LINE PAT
[2:46:32] <TalisKanju> Pat = Sherry, Paige = Birkin, Elmo = the G-Virus
[2:46:34] <artoflec> lmao
[2:46:35] <%SuperFineButtHairs> this game sucks
[2:46:37] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat do that monkey noise again buddy
[2:46:38] <%InugamiTheHound> that's when stand "safety dance"was born
[2:46:41] <+OranjSylus> I’m back from mixing a drink. Expected the whole game to be over with how shitty it’s pacing is.
[2:46:41] <JackKrauser> @ElenaManetta That's oddly specific. I'm intrigued now.
[2:46:41] <Avalon_One> Stop making me feel old
[2:46:44] <%StaceMcGate> Defense go down, but Strength go Up
[2:46:45] <+DeaconBluesClues> @SuperFineButtHairs boy does it
[2:46:46] <%domovoid> domovoid subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! apatWhat
[2:46:47] <$RealThiele> elmo as g-virus is fair
[2:46:49] <DeltaPangaea> Elmo responsible for the E Virus.
[2:46:53] <DeltaPangaea> Also known as Toxoplasmosis
[2:46:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I wonder if Pat will still insist that the TMP is a bad weapon when he streams RE4
[2:46:57] <FirearmsInstructor> Paige left the front door unlocked.
[2:47:05] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Toxoplasm Gondii
[2:47:15] <%SuperFineButtHairs> paige is the front door
[2:47:15] <Ipsenscastle> Elmo = Sherry, Paige = Birkin, Pat = Chief Irons
[2:47:16] <%SWFanatic> It's fine
[2:47:23] <dukenux> Pat, can you say the same line, that was near the end of 1st or 2nd episode of Detroit LP? That shit had me in tears
[2:47:23] <%Shadicara> Pat but what if you need that card later Kappa
[2:47:24] <TalisKanju> Fuck all that, Red-9 all the way
[2:47:26] <Fujiwara_92> T-Virus elmo
[2:47:28] <tusk102> @AngriestPat ELMO IS THE E VIRUS THATS WHY HIS NAME STARTS WITH E NEW LORE
[2:47:34] <%StaceMcGate> Chat, what was your favorite David Cage LP?
[2:47:36] <+DeaconBluesClues> @morcego_cinzento_arts its not "bad" per se but its like the blacktail in that its good if you prefer it but other weapons have higher dps
[2:47:37] <%heroicspiritavenger> @morcego_cinzento_arts Wasn't the TMP actually bad in the GCN version of RE4, and then they buffed it in all subsequent versions
[2:47:38] <CursedNobleman> the main sticking point with the TMP is that its another thing that takes space, great bosskiller though
[2:47:38] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Pat has Xactlys disease. it's where his face smells xactly like his butt LOL
[2:47:39] <+Scevda> I can definitely believe a future umbrella virus will use toxoplasmosis as the basis and have a theme around cats.
[2:47:44] <Oxybe> @bigdumbidiotguy as opposed to toxoplasma ghandi, which makes you explode 5he world
[2:47:47] <%sporeian94> OH MY GOD HOW MUCH LONGER!!!!
[2:47:50] <+Mitchellsocks> Wait, is CVX Umbrella's "main HQ in Europe"?
[2:47:51] <%DensityD> when was the last big time ONE GUY said some ONE GUY things?
[2:47:51] <Avalon_One> The pain nears it's end
[2:47:52] <$RealThiele> omikron was the best and worst
[2:47:55] <+DeaconBluesClues> in other words @Monkeyweed21 the Red 9 has BIG NUMBER

[2:48:10] <%D3rrtyD4n> elmo has the choco virus
[2:48:10] <Fujiwara_92> he's fine
[2:48:13] <%Agami23> i was talking to my mom about the muppets, and she had an old person moment of saying pepe the prawn was a pretty new muppet. she then realized he is from 1996 and she is old.
[2:48:14] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Elmo ate the Lindt Trugfle
[2:48:14] <FirearmsInstructor> A precaution for what? Nothing?
[2:48:14] <%nofestu2> HE LIVES
[2:48:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> My favorite was the Heavy Rain stream with Woolie
[2:48:16] <%ElenaManetta> Is anti-chocolate medicine just vegetables
[2:48:17] <someyounguy1> are there downsides t o giving him the medication?
[2:48:19] <%StaceMcGate> What is Anti-Chocolate? Gummy Worms? @AngriestPat
[2:48:20] <Ipsenscastle> That poor cat is having the worst night for no reason
[2:48:20] <%Taisuru> He didn't even need his stomach pumped
[2:48:22] <%natebud> The choco vaccine
[2:48:22] <%XzileGaming> anti...chocolate....medication? this sounds made up to appease paige
[2:48:22] <%Grayhammatter> oh god, did paige leave chocolate lying around?
[2:48:23] <%SilverFaustX> hope u insured
[2:48:25] <Ran196> do everything you can to save Elmo
[2:48:26] <s_snowball> wait did he eat the mud pie
[2:48:33] <Fujiwara_92> a precaution for no chocolate I see
[2:48:34] <trulythedude> choppy this playthrough
[2:48:36] <$RealThiele> skittles is anti-chocolate
[2:48:36] <+Diabetic> what the hell is anti chocolate medication? vanilla?
[2:48:37] <%bigdumbidiotguy> one time I did a thing and then I went to the place

[2:49:07] <MayorRev> haha imagine spending 300k on medical bills
[2:49:08] <%DensityD> apatCanada
[2:49:09] <%Dementedpenguin> @DensityD Not according to some in chat. He ate the cake. Kappa Kappa
[2:49:09] <Fujiwara_92> bad game bd
[2:49:10] <Avalon_One> Why is it that chocolate seems to kill eveything except us?
[2:49:13] <%SilverFaustX> yes but do pets also get free healthcare?
[2:49:13] <$RealThiele> you must kill it
[2:49:13] <$QueequegTheater> @sinistersally People don't even get free healthcare
[2:49:17] <SubjectX07x> @solidousstream The way Woolie aimed made me physically cringe.
[2:49:18] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat I said while you were playing REmake that you were going to eventually get to the point where you were just like, "fuck this game".
[2:49:19] <%heroicspiritavenger> Elmo is an American Cat, why would he get Canadian Healthcare?
[2:49:20] <FirearmsInstructor> WHY THE FUCK
[2:49:20] <Hellarussian> dont save, just be a man
[2:49:22] <%jiin6> they Reversed the polarity of the Chocolate chat
[2:49:23] <%D3rrtyD4n> apatWhat
[2:49:23] <%Grayhammatter> wow, fuck that
[2:49:24] <%peachy996> The problem with Classic RE style games like this SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN
[2:49:25] <dukenux> LUL
[2:49:26] <trulythedude> so cry about it
[2:49:26] <%SuperFineButtHairs> Does the canadian goverment not give you cat insurance?
[2:49:26] <Fujiwara_92> yeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[2:49:27] <$RealThiele> to save the game, you must kill
[2:49:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> definitely save
[2:49:31] <+DeaconBluesClues> @AngriestPat what sucks more this or CVX
[2:49:31] <dukenux> what great design
[2:49:32] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Submarine 2, Electric Boogaloo
[2:49:33] <%Shadicara> Go nuts in pat apatBougie
[2:49:36] <%bigdumbidiotguy> definitely don't save Kappa
[2:49:36] <arkv01> what fucking country has free healthcare for pets?
[2:49:39] <Oxybe> @sinistersally no, that's why the wait time isn't 6 months
[2:49:39] <garbageheaphound> dont dont save
[2:49:41] <$QueequegTheater> @MayorRev Fun fact, that's actually not how it works
[2:49:41] <tusk102> just never save
[2:49:42] <%SuperFineButtHairs> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:49:44] <TriadOrion> If ONLY there was some kind of MYSTICAL BOX.
[2:49:44] <Fujiwara_92> just don't save 4Head
[2:49:44] <+sinistersally> I thought Canada had unviersal healthcare
[2:49:45] <%bigdumbidiotguy> frog and leech man
[2:49:45] <+Scevda> @avalon_one Chocolate is extremely complex chemically.
[2:49:46] <%Agami23> is this on an emulator?
[2:49:46] <mankeytennis> You said Elmo is strong, but he is weak to chocolate.
[2:49:47] <%ElenaManetta> butt to butt
[2:49:50] <%StaceMcGate> Speedrun cancelled
[2:49:51] <arkv01> yeah for PEOPLE
[2:49:53] <%Monkeyweed21> wrong way
[2:49:53] <MayorRev> imagine if licking chocolate cost you thousands of dollars
[2:49:54] <TalisKanju> Pat = Excella, Paige = Wesker, Elmo = Uroboros
[2:49:55] <$RealThiele> this is worse than cvx ezpz, its longer and full of shitty UI garbage
[2:49:55] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @DeaconBluesClues i wasn't condemning his past opinion per say. i was mmore curious really. Cause it's been so long since that LP and one of the main focuses of the commenting of that was focused on some of the weapons like the TMP. I like the TMP but only fully upgraded and with the stock
[2:49:55] <+necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat ass or tits, Pat?
[2:49:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @bigdumbidiotguy half right
[2:49:58] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I liked the final boss from Revelations 1
[2:49:58] <$QueequegTheater> The vast majority of costs are eaten by the insurance company
[2:49:59] <rytisone> and then boss decides to gang up on partner AI
[2:50:01] <cureneckbeard> elmo is big and strong
[2:50:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Just win the boss fights without saving Kappa
[2:50:02] <arkv01> cats are fuckig animals you dumbasses
[2:50:03] <MayorRev> this post was made by free healthcare gang
[2:50:06] <%solidousstream> i think my biggest problem with this game is its god awful pacing like if you fuck up once its all a slog
[2:50:12] <%natebud> ran back to get herb, forgot to save
[2:50:13] <dukenux> Nah, Pat would be Irving
[2:50:15] <+DeaconBluesClues> @AngriestPat I think this sucks more than CVX. At least CVX lets you have fun stabbing things with the knife. This game has the most painful puzzles I've ever experienced in any RE game
[2:50:21] <WaxWitch> it's like once animals get domesticated they lose all survival instincts dogFail bloody hell
[2:50:21] <%SilverFaustX> well in amsterdam u can get free cat care
[2:50:24] <$RealThiele> agreed
[2:50:28] <CursedNobleman> government subsidized pet healthcare would try fights between pet owners and non pet owners
[2:50:31] <Hellarussian> just dont fuck up
[2:50:31] <%the_vedo_show> agreed
[2:50:32] <%DensityD> save?
[2:50:33] <%SuperFineButtHairs> that and billy is a code
[2:50:35] <%bigdumbidiotguy> this game is just fucking crappy POO poo
[2:50:36] <Ipsenscastle> It's a slog regardless of if you fuck up
[2:50:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I don't know, even not fucking up seems like a slog.
[2:50:42] <$QueequegTheater> @MayorRev Fun fact Mississippi has a higher average income and quality of life than the nation of France
[2:50:42] <%DensityD> goblin time
[2:50:43] <+necrocannibal2> CVX was less boring
[2:50:44] <TalisKanju> Sounds like you are describing CVX in a nutshell
[2:50:45] <%sporeian94> BEEN SITTING HERE FOR DAYS! START THE DAMN FINAL BOSS BEFORE I PISS MESELF
[2:50:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat why you were in a save room
[2:50:47] <%SuperFineButtHairs> long apatBougie apatBougie apatBougie
[2:50:47] <yourliteraldog> long bois
[2:50:48] <Fujiwara_92> C A T IS C A T
[2:50:48] <BurdRightsActivist> @bigdumbidiotguy Ur crappy poo POO POOO
[2:50:53] <%unclekulikov> Is this better or worse than Resident Evil 6?
[2:50:53] <$RealThiele> cvx jank was hilarious cause of big dumb
[2:50:54] <%peachy996> Nothing happens and the areas aren't very interesting
[2:50:55] <%bigdumbidiotguy> CVX at least has music
[2:50:56] <+necrocannibal2> CVX is still less boring
[2:51:02] <%natebud> CVX was way more boring
[2:51:03] <%jiin6> apatBougie long corridor man bad
[2:51:04] <%solidousstream> exactly
[2:51:08] <%bigdumbidiotguy> does this game have any music besides in cutscenes or save rooms?
[2:51:08] <%Shadicara> Final stretch goblins are coming apatGoblin
[2:51:09] <tusk102> @AngriestPat oh my god they have the same level design of backtracking
[2:51:10] <@commanderclaw> The Baker Estate is way better designed
[2:51:11] <%StaceMcGate> CVX had Alfred so it's a better game @AngriestPat
[2:51:11] <%D3rrtyD4n> cvx is boring
[2:51:11] <%peachy996> No L Hallway no Guard House no Aquaring
[2:51:14] <$QueequegTheater> CVX was either less boring or more boring
[2:51:15] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @heroicspiritavenger I played the ps2 version and i remember that it was quite solid. So maybe the game cube version might indeed had a very weak TMP. But them again i would argue that the TMP shines when it's fully upgraded and with the stock
[2:51:19] <%SilverFaustX> yea but france sucks
[2:51:21] <%peachy996> Nothing like the LAb in RE2
[2:51:24] <JackKrauser> Agreed claw.
[2:51:25] <+necrocannibal2> yeah, where the fuck is the music in this game?
[2:51:26] <Oxybe> Canadian health care is great if you can afford to wait.
[2:51:26] <Fujiwara_92> CVX had steve
[2:51:27] <%Dementedpenguin> CVX has Steve Burnside, so........
[2:51:29] <%SuperFineButtHairs> long and thick apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:51:29] <+Scevda> 6 i believe is fun just exceedingly stupid
[2:51:31] <%peachy996> Or the town in RE3
[2:51:32] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> This looks way better than CVX, CVX was this plus ass graphics
[2:51:32] <$RealThiele> steeeeeve
[2:51:40] <+DeaconBluesClues> CVX sucks the way a bad dreamcast era game sucks, but this game feels like an unfun parody of Resident Evil, and thats worse
[2:51:41] <TalisKanju> Thia game is warping Pat's mind - he's imagining Save Rooms in places they aren't
[2:51:42] <%Monkeyweed21> DONT FORGET ABOUT NECRID STEVE
[2:51:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @commanderclaw +1
[2:51:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> TMP was pretty fuckin good. Shit melts.
[2:51:47] <%bigdumbidiotguy> LOL I can't believe I didn't realize before that this game has like no music.
[2:51:47] <%jiin6> there are french people in canada, so canada sucks
[2:51:49] <Hellarussian> Steve is the key to all this
[2:51:49] <%theotherkristian> Play FE of EW2
[2:51:50] <%StaceMcGate> I Am the Commander of this Installation!
[2:51:51] <Oxybe> if you can't wait, well fuck you.
[2:51:51] <Ipsenscastle> It's like if FF13 had backtracking
[2:51:54] <%natebud> CVX had like no music at all. You guys are misremembering it alreadt
[2:51:57] <%SuperFineButtHairs> Well RE3 is a good game
[2:52:00] <dukenux> CVX had Alvin too
[2:52:07] <%bigdumbidiotguy> this game sucks ass lol
[2:52:07] <tusk102> @AngriestPat it's also in a city that you care about

[2:52:16] <+DeaconBluesClues> @natebud I will say CVX has one specific track that makes me shit my pants
[2:52:18] <%sporeian94> VIRUBS
[2:52:19] <rytisone> VIRUS ALERT
[2:52:19] <Fujiwara_92> ff13 is just corridors, how could it even have backtracking
[2:52:20] <%jiin6> @StaceMcGate not any more you're not
[2:52:20] <%bigdumbidiotguy> then the only music consistantly is a 7 second loop
[2:52:22] <+Mitchellsocks> No Music? JUST like DARK SOULS!
[2:52:22] <$QueequegTheater> Hey man, Windows Defender saved my ass this week
[2:52:23] <@commanderclaw> Oh god, that spooked me
[2:52:27] <SubjectX07x> Windows defender says this game is a virus.
[2:52:27] <%bigdumbidiotguy> that clips upon repeating
[2:52:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's trying to defend you against RE0
[2:52:30] <dukenux> Is there anyone that could be called "a villain" of this game, besides cutscene Wesker?
[2:52:32] <+OranjSylus> So I have an actually played RE4 since like 2009.
[2:52:32] <%SilverFaustX> even windows wants u to stop playin this
[2:52:35] <%sporeian94> Is this The Dark Souls of Resident Evil?
[2:52:35] <+necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat this save room theme is like a 3 second loop wtf
[2:52:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> quick, delete it.

[2:54:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Woolie and his mind goblins, amirite Pat?
[2:54:41] <%honeyman18> Woolie has the computer usage of my mother
[2:54:41] <%solidousstream> LUL LUL LUL
[2:54:42] <$RealThiele> tell woolie to never update his FG roster
[2:54:42] <+MrTurtleThief> NotLikeThis update pls
[2:54:42] <%Rngiddion> Woolie being arrogant, the true self
[2:54:44] <%bigdumbidiotguy> that dude edits videos lol and has for years
[2:54:44] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's like not bathing for months, then getting upset because the drain gets too clogged from your caked on shit.
[2:54:45] <cesare92x> wow to finish this one is taking for ever
[2:54:46] <%ElenaManetta> why update... what ain't broke....
[2:54:46] <%SilverFaustX> u should update when he isnt looking

[2:54:48] <%Shadicara> Woolie was the real boomer all along LUL
[2:54:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Never update things
[2:54:51] <%NWR_James> "Turn off Windows Update" - @AngriestPat
[2:54:51] <%Black_Machete> woolie had a stream issue earlier today
[2:54:52] <xinexes> this sounds like a pat move
[2:54:54] <StarlitStunner> woolieOMG woolieOMG
[2:54:56] <%Laecerelius> Nobody knows about mind goblins more than a man full of mind goblins
[2:54:57] <FourLeafLover> woolie should get a mac
[2:55:01] <+Diabetic> So he's on Windows 98 with that process then?
[2:55:02] <%kingbaconcrispy> Pat is so close to renouncing Woolie
[2:55:03] <Fujiwara_92> Woolie has mind blankas no mind goblins
[2:55:04] <%takiyami> Like literally just turn it off when you go to sleep. If you have an SSD it takes like five seconds to boot back up.
[2:55:04] <Ipsenscastle> @FirearmsInstructor that's a horrifyingly apt analogy
[2:55:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> @AngriestPat is there a correlation between the amount of item slots a RE game gives you and its over all quality of a game?
[2:55:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Next time on Woolie Will Figure It Out: Computers in General
[2:55:07] <rcand9> update your windows kids unless told not to by an a warning

[2:55:15] <Happy_Karl> I will run windows 7 until I literally can't use it for anything anymore. I will die on this hill.
[2:55:15] <Maverick2736> Is it wrong that I'm kindof like Woolie, but when it comes to Firefox updates?

[3:02:49] <%domovoid> It's REALLY powerful, especially against living things!
[3:02:54] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat am I going insane or does Becky use re-used Cammy hit noises from Street Fighter Alpha 3? Because that shit sounds identical.
[3:02:59] <+Finch_9001> What’s next after Zero?

[3:03:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That was probably too far.
[3:03:32] <%WackyXmand> nothing encompasses this games plot more than Billy and Rebecca showing up in front of the villain and going "Who are you?"
[3:03:33] <%Shadicara> Easy boss fountain
[3:03:33] <+Finch_9001> @cursednobleman hurray, ty

[3:03:58] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why?
[3:04:02] <%xeros720> i feel like they didn't expect people to "store" things places
[3:04:03] <+Soulbishop> Did the slug assume his shape or did it rebuild him? And if so where is the slugs consciousness?
[3:04:07] <TomFrank> because items
[3:04:08] <rytisone> I wish this game just gave you boss fountain and then ended

[3:04:31] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap but no
[3:04:34] <FirearmsInstructor> oh wait

[3:04:37] <+RowenCleric> 3 ink ribbons here just incase though
[3:04:38] <%StaceMcGate> I don't think you have enough health items Kappa
[3:04:40] <$QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Pat they had to save the item box for later games
[3:04:47] <%bigdumbidiotguy> hey guys remember when we fucked you over inventory wise in CVX
[3:04:53] <%jiin6> but he had a box
[3:04:55] <$QueequegTheater> they needed it later
[3:04:57] <$RealThiele> birkin made sure umbrella had boxes
[3:04:59] <tusk102> @AngriestPat maybe it's the same elevator you don't know
[3:05:01] <FourLeafLover> it's a nice art asset

[3:05:21] <%Shadicara> Is this a big man moment?
[3:05:25] <%natebud> Best part of this game is the squeek Billy's shoe makes

[3:09:12] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater I was surprisingly unmolested by any of the wildlife while I was out there. Which is good, because brown snakes like to hide in grass that long in summer. That is the species, btw. Brown or King Brown. Confusingly, they're often not actually coloured brown. But sometimes they are. Because you know, when you get bitten by a deadly snake, it's really great when a guessing game is made part of the treatment for it.
[3:09:13] <Fujiwara_92> yeah

[3:12:33] <%Zulrez> no, we must pray for elmo more, so he can become immune to the chocolate and have his favorite snack
[3:12:37] <%ScreamLord> If he turns into Berkin monster

[3:19:27] <%Laecerelius> Leeches are like vampires, right? I mean they both drink blood
[3:19:28] <%sporeian94> It's like Signs when the aliens are weak to water, something the planet is covered with 75% of
[3:19:28] <%ElenaManetta> my only weakness was oxygen
[3:19:29] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> she'll just take over the world overnight it's fine

[3:19:41] <%StaceMcGate> It's only weakness is water and doorknobs
[3:19:41] <+Buttsong> this game could have been solved by billy and beccy just fucking in the mansion foyer and leaving in the morning
[3:19:42] <Djinnazz> no
[3:19:42] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Alucard
[3:19:43] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat It is like if you made Paige into a weapon
[3:19:44] <%StoicMoogle> Is that why we only see Raccoon City get fucked at night?
[3:19:45] <%Shadicara> Count Cuckula
[3:19:45] <TeethandHunger> SAM-e for cats is good for cat livers and can actually repare liver damage. Ask your Vet about it.

[3:19:58] <%ssjklyco> How was it going to defeat umbrella with light as the weakness
[3:19:58] <%natebud> Yeah, who would live on a lava plant
[3:20:00] <+Saintsinhell24> They weren't invading dumbasses
[3:20:00] <%RubberFistFight> IT'S CALLED HUMIDITY
[3:20:01] <dukenux> yes, but so is to most Shyamlan movies
[3:20:01] <Badgerconda_> THE ALIENS WERE DEMONS
[3:20:03] <%AncelDeLambert> TOUKO!
[3:20:04] <%RubberFistFight> FUCKING STUPID SHIT
[3:20:04] <$RealThiele> aliens actually mind goblins
[3:20:05] <%bigdumbidiotguy> aliens are dumb and sniff farts
[3:20:06] <%Agami23> its a metaphor for holy water
[3:20:07] <%DensityD> tell Jimmy, swing away
[3:20:07] <MachineHead9> i totally forgot about that part LUL
[3:20:07] <%Laecerelius> moisture is always in the fucking air
[3:20:08] <dukenux> BUT IT WAS THE SAME IN WAR OF THE WORLDS
[3:20:08] <worldbrand> it's an allegory, but it's a really bad one

[3:20:11] <TomFrank> I was actually scared of that movie as a kid LUL
[3:20:13] <%cvp5127> did they not notice the ocean?
[3:20:16] <%RubberFistFight> @Agami23 it's a fucken dumb metaphor.
[3:20:17] <+Nymphonomicon> The aliens left the smart guy on their home planet.
[3:20:18] <%EndlessScrapper> A reminder that moonlight is reflected sunlight. Meaning that on any night the moon was out it wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as direct exposure but I imagine it still be uncomfortable for a sunlight hating creature
[3:20:18] <%Coystick> IT'S HOLY WATER THEY'RE DEMONS it isn't LITERAL
[3:20:18] <%ScreamLord> The AIR is filled with water vapor!
[3:20:18] <%sporeian94> There's a theory that they're demons cause the MC is a preist and it's all about them rediscovering faith or some shit
[3:20:19] <%ha2ken> Aliens bad at biochemistry
[3:20:20] <%Mr_Pylon> fuck it, YOLO

[3:20:29] <tusk102> @AngriestPat sunlight doesn't just weaken it. it just straight up kills it. Also weren't the re4 deadly to sunlight too and thats why they die to flash grenades?
[3:20:29] <Neo_Kaiser> The aliens were angels and the water was holy water.
[3:20:29] <%bigdumbidiotguy> HERE COMES THE SUN
[3:20:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> We go places that are 100% death, but we wear shit to counter that death.
[3:20:31] <%solidousstream> also in buildings youd just have to use special uv lights to kill them

[3:26:10] <%SuperFineButtHairs> BUT HOLY WATER HAHA
[3:26:11] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> !uptime
[3:26:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 26m.
[3:26:12] <42nfl19> IT FUCKING RAINS
[3:26:13] <%Owkono> apatDab
[3:26:13] <Deadbulky> War of the worlds is litterally that stupid, dies from our planet
[3:26:13] <Oxybe> C LOUDS ARE WATER IN AIR FORM
[3:26:16] <yourliteraldog> chunky clouds
[3:26:18] <+PanicSwytch> But what if they want to teraform
[3:26:20] <%jiin6> Nudist Aliens
[3:26:20] <%ComicLord> ComicLord subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Sup baby man
[3:26:21] <+StrawberryPantsu> It's so you can see their big ol' alien dicks
[3:26:21] <+Scevda> “Pale blue dot”
[3:26:23] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> is the stream almost over?
[3:26:24] <%ScreamLord> "What a twist!"
[3:26:24] <dukenux> Shyamalamadingdong
[3:26:25] <stealthfart> @lucaflow He mentioned her role in the CG movie in passing
[3:26:28] <Oxybe> THEY PASSED THROUGH THAT SHT
[3:26:29] <%SuperFineButtHairs> WHAT ABOUT THE WATER IN THE FUCKING AIR
[3:26:30] <$RealThiele> so do they die from high humidity?
[3:26:30] <karl_rex> When did aliens come into this?
[3:26:31] <%sporeian94> "The Next Steven Speilberg"
[3:26:33] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> the aliens left, but the last one wanted revenge
[3:26:37] <rumblebunni> What about Earth's Humidity
[3:26:38] <Avalon_One> Maybe they wanted to die
[3:26:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Let's not.
[3:26:42] <%RubberFistFight> Honestly sci-fi gets one thing wrong CONSTANTLY. When humans land on a new planet and the air is breathable, they're like "oh we don't need suits". Yeh, the second they take those off, the bacteria in the air and soil that is NOT OF EARTH and therefore the characters have no immunity to, should start colonising their bodies, and after an hour or so their fucking eyes should start melting and they die screaming drowning in their own blood.
[3:26:44] <rytisone> defeat them with water guns
[3:26:45] <%Sadira_snack_attack> What about humidity?
[3:26:45] <KingKZ> Human beings HAVE WATER IN THEM!
[3:26:46] <Deadbulky> Whip out the super soaker
[3:26:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> talkin about Signs
[3:26:47] <%AncelDeLambert> the PLANET's a lake
[3:26:47] <%TDotGoat> are aliens fire?
[3:26:48] <zenith0111> doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[3:26:50] <Azathotic> The aliens = demons, demons hate (holy) water
[3:26:50] <%natebud> Best comparison I've heard is that it's like us invading a lava planet @AngriestPat
[3:26:51] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> BUT AIR IS WATER
[3:26:51] <+Diabetic> there's a popular theory that the aliens are demons and it's holy water that hurts them
[3:26:54] <%jiin6> they don't have to land near the ocean pat
[3:26:55] <+OranjSylus> Oh god they never realized it rained???
[3:26:55] <%Laecerelius> JUST BUY X-COM SOME FUCKING SUPER SOAKERS! THE GOOD ONES WITH THE PUMPS!
[3:26:56] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> essays in chat calebSleeper
[3:26:59] <%sporeian94> They must get the worst swamp ass
[3:26:59] <%peachy996> "Hey look at that blue planet with stuff we hate, let's conquer it!"
[3:26:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What about Fog or Mist?
[3:26:59] <Fujiwara_92> BUT AIR HAVE WATER
[3:27:00] <Azathotic> Also, the alien invasion was global
[3:27:00] <%StaceMcGate> M NIGHT SHYAMALAN STREAM
[3:27:01] <%Agami23> but is that water holy?
[3:27:01] <Plague_bagel> they knew, but they aint no bitch either
[3:27:02] <%lionandfox21> Yp the tropics would KILL THEM
[3:27:03] <%ElenaManetta> They're not REAL ALIENS. They're DEMONS FROM HELL which is why they hate water because THEY LIVE IN FIRE
[3:27:04] <gekizenbu> is human blood enough to melt the aliens
[3:27:07] <%SoFarFetched> OH THE HUMIDITY
[3:27:09] <%ElenaManetta> twist
[3:27:09] <$RealThiele> Tholians laugh
[3:27:10] <tusk102> @AngriestPat you used a magnum which you had already used like 28 times+40 grenade rounds. Also tell her that billy is a criminal and that's why he is 'dead'
[3:27:10] <Oxybe> THE EARTH IS FULL OF WATER AND COVERED BY VAPOUR WATER
[3:27:11] <%ScreamLord> "YEAH lets invade this planet made of sulfuric acid!"
[3:27:11] <%AncelDeLambert> constantly melting
[3:27:11] <%solidousstream> what about puddles? do they melt like the fuckin witch of the west?
[3:27:15] <%LaughingCatt> Literally almost all of the air on Earth has some level of moisture
[3:27:15] <clonexsniperx> so we do a death stranding and piss on them
[3:27:15] <dukenux> Or Arsenic
[3:27:15] <%jiin6> Acid planey would be worse for us
[3:27:16] <cureneckbeard> you can pour water on the lava and make obsidian.
[3:27:17] <DeltaPangaea> Maybe a planet made of acid makes more sense.
[3:27:17] <gekizenbu> people are also MAD OF WATER
[3:27:18] <%NopeBadguy> that's just mustafar
[3:27:18] <%peachy996> We will invade Venus
[3:27:18] <yourliteraldog> Alien Demons
[3:27:22] <DarkestDawn64> Walking on Venus without a suit
[3:27:22] <+Breaknoon> what if they were desperate
[3:27:22] <+Saintsinhell24> THEY DID NOT INVADE
[3:27:23] <%honeyman18> the signs movie is actually about demons and jesus
[3:27:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I mean, if anyone would invade a planet of lava, it would be us.
[3:27:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> It is so humid here, no way they weren't at least breaking out in boils
[3:27:25] <%sporeian94> Least they stayed in the tripods
[3:27:26] <%cdrom321> Defeated by Super Soakers.
[3:27:27] <%WackyXmand> stop talking about Signs and start talking about Lady in the Water, that's a garbage movie
[3:27:29] <chronoxgp> he ripped off Jacob's Ladder
[3:27:29] <EuropanLamprey> They have cloaking technology but clothing is a foreign concept?
[3:27:31] <Meekest> That book was written in the 1910s Pat its fine
[3:27:33] <%natebud> We traded all those blankets with the aliens
[3:27:34] <+necrocannibal2> War of the Worlds?
[3:27:34] <cureneckbeard> maybe they don't have germs on their planet
[3:27:36] <MachineHead9> they don't have germs from where they came from
[3:27:37] <Deadbulky> So dumb
[3:27:41] <Djinnazz> Maybe they don't have germs on her planet
[3:27:43] <%honeyman18> The water works cause the girl is Christ
[3:27:44] <%peachy996> Swing Away!
[3:27:45] <%SuperFineButtHairs> they didnt have germs on their planet
[3:27:46] <rytisone> they didn't have Biohazard to warn them
[3:27:48] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> God wills it.
[3:27:49] <%ElenaManetta> Angels in the Outfield
[3:27:50] <%leinadtonu> god?
[3:27:51] <%sporeian94> Cause they were demons
[3:27:52] <Fujiwara_92> god
[3:27:53] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat this is even dumber considering Shyamalan is one of those hacks that says his filmography is one universe
[3:27:53] <%TwinBat> yes
[3:27:55] <%LaughingCatt> yup
[3:27:56] <%nofestu2> Thanks Lord
[3:27:56] <$Afterman_> theyre all demonssss
[3:27:56] <+Buttsong> war of the worlds still checks out if they came from a planet viruses never evolved on
[3:27:57] <worldbrand> yes
[3:27:57] <%peachy996> I didn't see Signs I saw Scary Movie 3 instead
[3:27:57] <%EndlessScrapper> Speaking of lava fun fact you can't be near freaking lava. At all. Its so hot it burns your lungs. All movies showing people just casually standing around flowing lava is BS
[3:27:58] <%sporeian94> That's the theory is they're demons not allens
[3:27:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> God wanted the Aliens to be weak to water
[3:28:00] <%SuperFineButtHairs> jesus apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:28:01] <+Zereaux> sexy aliens
[3:28:01] <+Breaknoon> CAUSE THEY WERE DEMONS
[3:28:04] <%Laecerelius> Mel Gibson the fucking putz
[3:28:04] <%RubberFistFight> War of the Worlds is about the only fucking time I've seen that shit played straight. They get done in by bacteria that they're totally incapable of mounting an immunity to. All of their technology and firepower, all of their alien military clout, none of it stands a chance against the bacteria.
[3:28:06] <%peachy996> Scary Movie 3 is a better Signs
[3:28:06] <+necrocannibal2> Mel Gibson is too powerful
[3:28:06] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Aliens that travel light years in effective space ships, with romulan invisible cloak style tech. And yet they cannot open wooden doors with a rotating knob
[3:28:06] <mankeytennis> So you could just piss or cum in an aliens general direction
[3:28:07] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> you're not playing a game so you should switch to just chatting calebSM
[3:28:09] <%Agami23> the demonic monsters are weak to holy water.
[3:28:09] <Avalon_One> At least Battle: L.A had the Aliens invade because of our abundance of water
[3:28:12] <Deadbulky> Then came jeeebus baring a hose
[3:28:14] <%leinadtonu> Our god is stronger than their, clearly.
[3:28:14] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> its a good flick
[3:28:14] <%peachy996> Angels in The Outfield is cool
[3:28:16] <Djinnazz> what??
[3:28:17] <%Niney_Who> Pat

[3:30:30] <StarlitStunner> Liquid brain
[3:30:30] <%sporeian94> An angel is generally a supernatural being found in various religions and mythologies. Abrahamic religions often depict angels as benevolent celestial beings who act as intermediaries between God (or Heaven) and humanity.[1][2] Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings, and carrying out tasks on behalf of God.[3] Abrahamic religions often organize angels into hierarchies, although such rankings may vary between sects in each religion. Such angels may receive specific name

[3:36:06] <stabbityrabbit> To the people saying that angels are dead people in D&D, the souls don't immediately become angels. Not only that, but all the alignment based outsiders are the souls of people who were of that alignment in life. Hell in D&D isn't a punishment for dead people who were bad, it's just a place so steeped in evil that evil souls naturally flock there. Fun facts.
