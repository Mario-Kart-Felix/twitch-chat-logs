[0:12:00] <+VidulaSaix> Shitty situation no matter how it went.
[0:12:04] <cizal11> it makes sense, but it's still a plan that involves killing a bunch of people who aren't willing to go, unlike the ascians who were willing.

[0:13:52] <%Fidel_Castbro> We was Big Asians N Shit
[0:13:53] <Clammy_chan> y'get it? FF 14! they did it!
[0:13:53] <+Masutasodo> 14th counsel member
[0:13:56] <%weissguard> and ARDBERT is YOU
[0:13:57] <StarMechV> ARDBERT IS YOU, BABA IS YOU, thereby BABA is Adbert
[0:13:57] <+Lost_Zombie> Nah Pat you were just the janitor they all liked
[0:13:57] <SailingSaturn> cirPls
[0:13:58] <%VioletHeart> Baba *is* you.
[0:14:01] <Inollia> so the gender of the 14th changes depending on the character you play !!
[0:14:01] <+Estuko> @AngriestPat you are truly the 14th final fantasy
[0:14:01] <cizal11> @Inollia it's a soul, after all
[0:14:03] <+Artemis_Scowl> you're the 14th?!?
[0:14:05] <%Yadogari> THE BIG ASCIAN
[0:14:05] <+HelloImTom08> it was me Dio
[0:14:06] <%BlueMoonBlues> The WoL is an Ascian
[0:14:07] <%SlowLikeThunder> one of the big dick cool boys
[0:14:07] <+notgac> you were the BIG ascian
[0:14:09] <+VidulaSaix> See Pat gets it
[0:14:09] <+Karasseram> we are one of the 14 leaders
[0:14:10] <zajoestar> But Baba....\
[0:14:10] <%Roundelay11> You were totally the dissident that summoned Hydaelyn
[0:14:12] <TuxedoNash> You really were the FF XIV after all
[0:14:13] <+Kelpus> Now we can answer Thordans "Who... WHAT are you?" LUL
[0:14:15] <+MisterCrimson> BABA is ARDBERT, EMET is SAD
[0:14:21] <ArcadeDomination> It was me austin
[0:14:24] <DarkCloud79> Not ascian, amaurite
[0:14:25] <%NobleJedi> Truely
[0:14:26] <Everdarke> You summoned hydaelyn, no wonder she's hot for you
[0:14:27] <BunnyEmperor> You are the game PogChamp
[0:14:27] <ExpressNode> Baba is ascian
[0:14:28] <gekizenbu> the Shadowbringers (TM)
[0:14:28] <%Yadogari> we were the 14th fantasy the whole time
[0:14:29] <bear_breaker20> orthodox ascian
[0:14:33] <snakesonabane> The real Fourteenth Final Fantasy Fourteen were the primals we summoned on the way
[0:14:35] <%tsubaki_atsuki> BABA IS ASCIEN
[0:14:39] <+TheImmortal70> Amaurot is a capitol city, it's still Ascian
[0:14:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> You are the internet
[0:14:44] <+iheartmota> so the 14th ascian summoned hydaelyn
[0:14:45] <glitchedmatt1> "So we're some kind of Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers huh?"
[0:14:51] <Clammy_chan> if anyone in this game calls your character the Final Fantasy or some shit like that we better get our money back
[0:14:53] <CrypticMochi> Hydaelyn was your butt baby
[0:14:57] <+Double_Tap_That> @AngriestPat Wait, if this city is a reconstruction of a time right before all was lost, then isn't it ACTUALLY a Final Fantasy?
[0:15:00] <kanodin> no but his sword is called shadowbringer
[0:15:02] <+Truthmoon> ye Ardbert is a fragment of the same Ascian you are
[0:15:07] <Kongro_> we were the Final Fantasy 14 all along
[0:15:07] <%TG_Cid11> Fun fact you are Hydaelyn's Thrall
[0:15:07] <+VidulaSaix> I look forward to Pat telling Woolie "We really ARE the FF14" on the podcast and being totally serious LUL
[0:15:09] <SSD_Stryker> you can never tell the other scions about that
[0:15:12] <%korth367> go weast
[0:15:13] <cizal11> @Double_Tap_That i hate that you're right
[0:15:22] <+Karasseram> I wanna know our true name
[0:15:35] <+SatsumaVA> damn, this music
[0:15:37] <$Yakobro> @Karasseram dickbutt
[0:15:39] <+iheartmota> what was the title of the 14th member?
[0:15:39] <+VidulaSaix> Im pretty sure we're Hythlodaeus
[0:15:40] <Inollia> basically ardbert and the character you play are a fragment of the 14th ascian, whos gender depends on your character
[0:15:40] <Everdarke> There's a cave entrance
[0:15:41] <BunnyEmperor> Its INSIDE a cave Pat
[0:15:41] <%vivinxs> theres a hole to go down
[0:15:41] <kanodin> it's a cave
[0:15:42] <%BlueMoonBlues> get flying, nerd
[0:15:42] <%korth367> cave
[0:15:43] <cizal11> @AngriestPat keep going, there's a small hole
[0:15:43] <%Lapinelis> It's a cave
[0:15:43] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> theres a tunnel
[0:15:45] <+Estuko> WUT
[0:15:46] <%Lithdoran> Our Ascian name, lol
[0:15:52] <+Estuko> TUNNEL SNAKES RULE
[0:15:53] <XrosHawk> That one is really annoying to find
[0:15:54] <+MisterCrimson> gotta fly ot get flying nerd
[0:15:56] <%korth367> look with your set of eyes damn it
[0:16:00] <%vivinxs> its on the north wall
[0:16:03] <+VidulaSaix> Fuck this current LUL
[0:16:11] <+Fynale> if we're a ressurection i'm gonna assume we're the ascian that proposed making zodiark
[0:16:13] <+iheartmota> wrong cave
[0:16:15] <glitchedmatt1> @Lithdoran Our ascian name was Final Fantasy 14
[0:16:21] <moogleboy1984> that's the wrong hole!
[0:16:22] <%DeadStage> Does this mean when the other shards rejoined and caused the calamities, WoL's from other shards like Ardbert rejoined with us and that's why we're so strong?
[0:16:22] <snakesonabane> What if our Ascian name was something lame, like Dennis
[0:16:24] <+Fynale> i mean hydaelin
[0:16:24] <%BlueMoonBlues> Noyce
[0:16:28] <+Kelpus> It's Kakarot. Kappa
[0:16:28] <%Lapinelis> And now you can dump the compass again till next year
[0:16:29] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat you've finally become A Realm Reborn
[0:16:30] <SargentToughie> Yeah I missed that one too.
[0:16:33] <+Karasseram> DeadStage yes probably
[0:16:36] <SargentToughie> it's a sneaky little bugger
[0:16:39] <srkAres> @snakesonabane i take offense to that
[0:16:41] <zajoestar> pog
[0:16:42] <%korth367> we fly soon
[0:16:42] <%demegodz> NICE NICE
[0:16:43] <%SlowLikeThunder> @DeadStage That's the implication I thing, yrah
[0:16:44] <+HelloImTom08> nice
[0:16:44] <$Yakobro> @DeadStage pretty much, which is why emet was testing to see if we could hold the light at this point
[0:16:48] <%Ranryu692> Pat, did you see that Metal Wolf Chaos has an August 6th release date?
[0:16:48] <+Estuko> @Fynale I was wiping my glasses and my brain read that as "We're the ascian that proposed to Mark Zuckerberg" and I was very confused and scared
[0:16:49] <Overloard> yay, you did the thing
[0:16:49] <moogleboy1984> are you ready for the true hype?
[0:16:51] <vaan_ratsbane> see ya in 2 years
[0:16:53] <Inollia> @DeadStage its the same for everyone though, everyone is 7/14 of their true self
[0:16:53] <Graxe_> Until 6.0
[0:16:53] <%korth367> till next expac
[0:16:54] <+superdoomshroom> Clap
[0:16:59] <+VidulaSaix> Thats not a dab
[0:17:00] <jackythefrost> Are you ready for the real hype Pat
[0:17:00] <+HelloImTom08> your not gonna save it D:
[0:17:06] <zajoestar> time for the last dungeon?
[0:17:10] <+HelloImTom08> I save mine, never deleted it
[0:17:15] <BunnyEmperor> Thats not how you do the Haurchefant, you have to lie on the floor and not move to do that
[0:17:17] <vaan_ratsbane> or in less if they go nuts and just deliver us some garlemald province mid shadowbringers
[0:17:23] <+plasticss> how does pat get the extra abilities to show up on the side? looks super helpful
[0:17:24] <$Yakobro> @Inollia only on the source :p
[0:17:27] <$CharlesRobinJr> now what do you do
[0:17:32] <glitchedmatt1> Maybe they'll add new zones in patches as we do Eden
[0:17:36] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> are you ready pat?
[0:17:38] <+carlrsen> where can i find a menu for my skins?
[0:17:44] <Thalchampz> @plasticss he did a tutorial on that, it's on his channel
[0:17:47] <%Lapinelis> @plasticss Wathc the intro to ff14 stream apt did he went over the ui
[0:17:52] <+plasticss> oh sick
[0:17:54] <+plasticss> ty
[0:18:04] <Inollia> @Yakobro yea of course since all shards go back to the source when destroyed
[0:18:15] <vaan_ratsbane> beware, he nerded out over ui for 1 hour
[0:18:23] <$Yakobro> @Inollia not... automatically, they messed up with the 13th
[0:18:28] <%Lithdoran> Ascians can CREATE THINGS WITH A THOUGHT why the hell would they need GUARDS?!
[0:18:28] <+SirBearic> well ya when you can make a weapon with your mind you wouldnt need someone to protect you
[0:18:46] <cizal11> YEAH a couple
[0:19:17] <+Krivvan> we're an animal sacrifice
[0:19:22] <gekizenbu> what if you thought up of guards
[0:20:02] <%Valdorick> I mean; note you guys wouldn't have this issue if the jackasses didn't just summon Hydalon, amirite?
[0:20:04] <$valriot> did she just sing Answers
[0:20:07] <glitchedmatt1> Pog
[0:20:13] <$CharlesRobinJr> WHO IS THAT
[0:20:13] <%korth367> hate fighting
[0:20:18] <Huntercd> Futaba?
[0:20:22] <%Valdorick> Man, they only wanted to sacrifice half of one generation Kappa
[0:20:27] <$Yakobro> @Valdorick the ascians plan might not have worked, and relied on killing shit anyway
[0:20:37] <Sol_Install> thats baseball
[0:20:41] <+zaras00> boy you ready
[0:20:45] <+zaras00> for some shit
[0:20:45] <+Karasseram> hype about to go up about 300%
[0:20:46] <切捨御免> BOY
[0:20:48] <%Maids4lyfe> they weren't going to kill sentient life though
[0:20:49] <snakesonabane> But aren't the heroes doing the exact same thing because the whole thing is time travel from a bad future?

[0:24:11] <%Jarvanii> you in fact have to talk to them again
[0:24:16] <%demegodz> @Huntercd Yes, for RTX in Austin
[0:24:16] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> baseball
[0:24:21] <切捨御免> that's not how you say baseball pat
[0:24:21] <%korth367> baseball
[0:24:25] <Renuarb> ITS RYNE TIME
[0:24:28] <%Diabetic> music sounds like the end of a persona game
[0:24:29] <%Ranryu692> LOL Detroit is one of the PS+ games this month
[0:24:42] <chronoxgp> fat evil
[0:24:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> she definitely wants the penis of darkness
[0:25:03] <snakesonabane> Does Alphinaud love Estinien or something
[0:25:03] <Huntercd> So Pat will be an hour and half away from me? Interesting.
[0:25:25] <+MisterCrimson> @snakesonabane pretty much
[0:25:33] <+Karasseram> alphinaud is 15 you pervs
[0:25:35] <ExpressNode> So if Pat does this quest does that mean he finished the expansion story?
[0:25:42] <kanodin> yep
[0:25:46] <jackythefrost> Yea
[0:25:49] <%tsubaki_atsuki> yuh
[0:25:51] <+GusJenkins> Hey pat, my friend wants me to pick this up, but I've only played until like lvl 20 on a class. Is it worth picking up now?
[0:25:54] <Inollia> alisaie and alphinauds are children
[0:25:55] <Bielzitcho> didn't alphinaud spend like 1 or 2 years in the first?
[0:26:00] <+Krivvan> well, there is extra stuff
[0:26:07] <bear_breaker20> elf years
[0:26:08] <%Valdorick> As we go toward the end game of the story line, in which Zodiark is discovered to be Yoshi P, the 75% sacrificed was the 1.0 staff, and 14'th Ascian is you, the player, helping make the game Kappa
[0:26:15] <%madogod> is pat audio garbage or is just me?
[0:26:15] <Bielzitcho> fair enough, forgot about him being an elf
[0:26:15] <kanodin> there'll be more story later, but right now this is it
[0:26:19] <%goose_attack_almanac> Buff Elf Nerd
[0:26:29] <%Lithdoran> @madogod just you
[0:26:29] <+Krivvan> there are more dungeons though
[0:26:36] <Inollia> @Bielzitcho he spent 1 year in the first but that would still only make him 16
[0:27:05] <jackythefrost> And they are basically ghosts in the First, they dont age physically here
[0:27:13] <zajoestar> baba is baseball
[0:27:17] <Overloard> it's the thought that counts thancred
[0:27:18] <%Gogogolem> Thancred will finally take care of Baseball, 12 years late but okay.
[0:27:19] <cizal11> say the right thing pat
[0:27:21] <$Yakobro> @Inollia wasn't he 15 at like the start of 2.0, so he'd be more than that
[0:27:30] <%VioletHeart> He was 16 at the start of ARR.
[0:27:35] <%VioletHeart> And was in the First for just under a year.
[0:27:38] <+Krivvan> so he;s at the very least 17 now
[0:27:42] <ExpressNode> You still fall to darkness but light is the key
[0:27:47] <Inollia> @Yakobro we don't know how much time passed and still he's a child
[0:27:50] <%demegodz> You're a good Baseball
[0:27:51] <%VioletHeart> So he's presumably 17 by now with the events of 2.0-4.0.
[0:27:53] <切捨御免> BibleThump
[0:27:58] <snakesonabane> it's vague, there's even a line in Stormblood saying that either 5 years past or a week has passed since 2.0
[0:28:01] <+Krivvan> we do know how long as passed in the First exactly
[0:28:04] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@moogleboy1984) (warning)
[0:28:07] <Inollia> do you really need a reason not to sexualize a child you sickos
[0:28:09] <%Roundelay11> Ryne is way better than old Minfillia
[0:28:09] <%Plaguemelon> apatSmug
[0:28:12] <cizal11> SAY THE RIGHT THING

[0:32:18] <+Estuko> Ysholta is great
[0:32:21] <chronoxgp> british people ugh
[0:32:30] <%Diabetic> This guy's a good voice actor
[0:32:34] <vaan_ratsbane> yeah xiii has some good stuff, but the characters and story aint it
[0:32:40] <+VidulaSaix> His race got a bad deal
[0:32:44] <snakesonabane> it's a great deal for him
[0:32:44] <切捨御免> for everybody who isn't an ascian, yeah
[0:32:45] <kaze7897> He doesn't think of us as people
[0:32:50] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat i mean he did admit he's hella tempered
[0:32:50] <kaze7897> Fragmented shades
[0:32:53] <Inollia> the evil wings background....thats some good shit
[0:32:54] <Everdarke> It's a massively good deal for him, really bad for us
[0:33:10] <+Estuko> "Came here to punch your dick"
[0:33:18] <%Diabetic> So this is third impact Final Fantasy style?
[0:33:38] <TyrantRaveOmega> Assians Kappa
[0:33:40] <gekizenbu> eighth, if you want to be specific
[0:33:40] <bear_breaker20> Kappa
[0:33:40] <%Valdorick> He's not even wrong.
[0:33:42] <snakesonabane> i mean, imagine sacrificing some guy with one day to live in order to save your best friend with a whole life ahead of him, that's probably how immortals feel
[0:33:54] <+Gruntini> lmao, they have nothing to say
[0:33:59] <Overloard> that camera angle
[0:34:01] <cizal11> he's not preserving anything though, he's trying to bring back people who are dead already
[0:34:04] <%Diabetic> lol
[0:34:07] <+VidulaSaix> Emet FeelsBadMan
[0:34:13] <%Gogogolem> He has a pretty good point. How many monkeys would you kill to bring back paige or i don't know Woolie.
[0:34:14] <+GusJenkins> @snakesonabane but what if they dude he saves like gets hit by a truck the next day or something
[0:34:14] <glitchedmatt1> Where is Rachel!
[0:34:16] <%demegodz> LOOK AT ME WHERE IS SHE
[0:34:17] <moogleboy1984> Where's Rachel!?
[0:34:22] <+rangriz> Emet is done with this shit
[0:34:25] <EmoLlama97> Emet fucks
[0:34:28] <bear_breaker20> justified murder* yuh okay
[0:34:31] <XrosHawk> MORAL RELATIVISM
[0:34:34] <ricotez> i like how his voice is starting to crack a bit
[0:34:38] <%demegodz> He did the anime hand!
[0:34:39] <%VioletHeart> Emet started a monarchy. We know he fucks.
[0:34:40] <Idon__> I FUCKED A GIRL, DUDE.
[0:34:41] <Everdarke> He's right tho
[0:34:48] <%Valdorick> Reminder - its not murder, you're not even people!
[0:34:52] <%NYCrownlessKing> no this is his real voice @ricotez
[0:34:52] <%Diabetic> Now for a true hero's reply: "Suck my dick you punk bitch."
[0:34:54] <Inollia> ascians do fuck
[0:34:59] <+Fynale> @VioletHeart he started 2 of them he did both allag and garlemald
[0:35:10] <ricotez> i feel sad for him but he's just way beyond the moral event horizon
[0:35:10] <+Estuko> "Hey being who's existence dwarfs my own, EAT MY ASS."
[0:35:11] <bear_breaker20> justified eugenics
[0:35:13] <$KnivesEve> cant wait till i get money to get to shadowbringers
[0:35:14] <bear_breaker20> *
[0:35:18] <ricotez> cool motive, still trying to sacrifice all life on the star
[0:35:26] <+VidulaSaix> He's super right about that LUL
[0:35:29] <+Fynale> i love how pats just genuinely wants to talk shit
[0:35:30] <+superdoomshroom> Is it implied that that he too founded the Ronkan Empire?
[0:35:30] <gekizenbu> @ricotez that's basically the point, it SUCKS but yeah he's nuts
[0:35:33] <snakesonabane> from the scion's perspective, he's talking bullshit, but life in eorzea is really really fucked for the average person
[0:35:34] <glitchedmatt1> Nope LUL
[0:35:35] <kaze7897> Probably not
[0:35:39] <+iheartmota> Nope
[0:35:51] <Mastigias> we'd all burn
[0:36:01] <ExpressNode> I wish you would stab him during this monologue
[0:36:02] <seycheles> pat big cares confirmed
[0:36:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> I was having WcDonald's, what did I miss?
[0:36:16] <%Lapinelis> A lot of shit.
[0:36:21] <bear_breaker20> 'save' how man just be cool and not dio
[0:36:22] <%Lapinelis> A lot.
[0:36:23] <cizal11> like he's not wrong, but he still just wants to kill everyone to do it.
[0:36:25] <+Artemis_Scowl> your time is up old man!
[0:36:26] <%Gogogolem> Basiaclly emets right humanitys garabage and we need to go.
[0:36:49] <%Lithdoran> Emet has a point, but I think he's gone a little crazy during his thousand thousand lifetimes
[0:36:50] <StarMechV> Boomer Emets
[0:36:51] <gekizenbu> but also fuck you i live here
[0:36:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> reading the script
[0:36:58] <XrosHawk> Emet feels like one of those "villians" who is doing this because he's gone too far with his actions and can't let all of it be for nothing
[0:37:04] <Thalchampz> yeah you tell em Alphinaud
[0:37:12] <%madogod> power of friendship can solved anything
[0:37:14] <+Krivvan> @XrosHawk: not like, is
[0:37:14] <%vivinxs> alphinaud best sweet boy
[0:37:15] <+futer> god pat's character is such a big lad
[0:37:17] <Heldritch1> its unfortunate what happened to them, but fuck the fact that they dont give a shit to what came after isnt right
[0:37:21] <+Zeromaru2> pretty much @XrosHawk
[0:37:22] <bear_breaker20> present > past neeerrrrrdd
[0:37:26] <+Fynale> i love that alpinaud get's a redemption arc this expansion
[0:37:26] <Idon__> "you had your turn, bitch."
[0:37:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, Persona!
[0:37:36] <%Valdorick> "The future is now, old man"
[0:37:40] <%madogod> alph the best waifu
[0:37:47] <snakesonabane> the ENTIRE POINT of this expansion is that the bad future already happened and time travel was needed to erase the future, it's basically the same thing
[0:37:47] <Dementedpenguin> Neon Genesis Beyond Two Souls up in here.
[0:37:48] <jackythefrost> @Fynale He already did in HW
[0:38:01] <ArcadeDomination> You've had your thousands of years old man

[0:41:49] <gekizenbu> so this is just Turbo Cancer
[0:41:49] <LokimenD> Terminus Stalker is a STRONG name
[0:41:50] <vaan_ratsbane> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[0:41:51] <ArcadeDomination> call doomslayer
[0:41:53] <%Valdorick> Void Woken!? So Emet is just Fane!
[0:41:54] <%vivinxs> this music is so GOOD
[0:41:56] <gekizenbu> Turbo Magic Cancer, even
[0:41:59] <%solomonpun> do you guys think 7.0 will legit be the moon like yoshi-p says it will?
[0:42:00] <%NYCrownlessKing> Hey our world is ending, also all of our creations transformed into demons.
[0:42:01] <%NYCrownlessKing> good luck
[0:42:05] <+Double_Tap_That> This dungeon is fucking awesome
[0:42:11] <+Karasseram> solomonpun look at this and guess
[0:42:12] <Country_Girl_101> SourPls
[0:42:12] <+Gruntini> *Mick Gordon music starts playing*
[0:42:18] <%SlowLikeThunder> This music is the fucking greatest
[0:42:19] <Thalchampz> @solomonpun i hope so, that would mean more FF4 content LUL
[0:42:22] <Overloard> terminus detonator monkaS
[0:42:24] <shevan123> is this entire story about entropy
[0:42:28] <+TheImmortal70> If Yoshi-P says the last expac is the moon, it's the fucking moon
[0:42:29] <snakesonabane> the ascians want to make a contract
[0:42:29] <bear_breaker20> I suggest people read Isaac Asimov if they like this subject matter
[0:42:34] <shevan123> is this really where this is fucking going
[0:42:41] <%solomonpun> @Karasseram you know what? touche
[0:42:46] <%Lapinelis> The laws of thermodynamics are coming to punch you bois
[0:42:50] <+lucaflow> Holy shit this dungeon is already hella rad
[0:42:54] <gekizenbu> well its entropy and negative emotions mxing together but yeah more or less
[0:42:56] <BlacSoul> Entropy comes for us all
[0:43:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> @bear_breaker20 Thanks for the recommend- I'll totally check that out
[0:43:04] <+SlumberMan> FF4 got screwed over during the Omega raids. They have to be saving its big references for the Moon.
[0:43:08] <ManlyMcBeefington> !uptime
[0:43:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 3m.
[0:43:13] <cizal11> one slightly worrying thing about this is there's some threat out there that is currently way beyond us, because these are not voidsent.
[0:43:16] <vaan_ratsbane> this dungeon's sound effects shook me ot the core while playing with loud volume, it's amazing
[0:43:30] <切捨御免> monkaS
[0:43:32] <gekizenbu> bear witness to the FIRST DOOM
[0:43:33] <Everdarke> Nice weather, good day for a stroll
[0:43:34] <13sin> imagine if every random bad thought you had manifested itself as real. every imagined horror however brief came to life. This is the problem with creation magic gone awry
[0:43:34] <%blaccbird914> YO THATS SICK
[0:43:35] <+notgac> that's ok weather
[0:43:35] <%MagickBurritoh> Edgelord weather
[0:43:37] <XrosHawk> Termination is a strong weather
[0:43:39] <$NitronStreams> that metal as fuck
[0:43:42] <worldbrand> good weather for flying kites
[0:43:45] <snakesonabane> It's just a little bit terminal outside today
[0:43:46] <srkAres> its like the weather we had last week
[0:43:47] <+Double_Tap_That> I fucking love how instead of location names, you get a story.
[0:43:47] <%Fidel_Castbro> what a coincidence the weather is also Termination where I'm at right now
[0:43:48] <alrobot2014> is termination during the rainy season?
[0:43:50] <+TheImmortal70> @cizal11 Nope, this is created by the Ascians. All these creatures are the horrors which their minds created as their world died
[0:43:51] <%Valdorick> No wonder they don't give a fuck about the Umbral Calamities, look at this shit.
[0:43:52] <%Maids4lyfe> partly cloudy with a chance of TERMINATION
[0:43:52] <ArcadeDomination> northern front of EXTINCTION
[0:43:53] <%SlowLikeThunder> The objectives in this dungeon are sick as shit too
[0:43:53] <glitchedmatt1> 100% chance of termination with high humidity monkaS
[0:43:54] <ExpressNode> That's current weather everyday
[0:43:59] <%crowsloft77> so they're anti spirals
[0:44:01] <worldbrand> Termination AGAIN this week?
[0:44:01] <Graxe_> Like, if this happened on the Source, there would actually be no coming back from this.
[0:44:02] <bear_breaker20> high chance of exterminatus this weekend
[0:44:04] <StarMechV> I always get sick around termination season
[0:44:08] <snakesonabane> personaaaa
[0:44:12] <Seraphile> this apocalypse is a SCP Memetic Hazard coming to life
[0:44:12] <%Diabetic> Since I'm starting a new character will I be able to experience all this, Heavensward, Stormblood or is this kind of like WoW where if I don't make it by a certain point, oh well?
[0:44:17] <vaan_ratsbane> yeah bahamut's rampage on eorzea is like 0.05% of this
[0:44:24] <Everdarke> Diabetic you will always get this
[0:44:24] <+justianxix> the shadow the true self
[0:44:25] <+TheImmortal70> @diabetic Absolutely, just buy the latest expac and you get it all
[0:44:26] <kanodin> you have to go through the whole story diabetic
[0:44:32] <+MisterCrimson> I AM THOU, THOU ART a Bitch
[0:44:33] <kanodin> it's the opposite of wow
[0:44:39] <jackythefrost> @Diabetic THis is a heavily storybased MMO, you gotta go through ALL of it
[0:44:39] <$Yakobro> @Diabetic you HAVE to do the story in order unless you buy a skip potion
[0:44:40] <13sin> @Diabetic you'll get to do all this. FFXIV has a system that filsl lower level sutff with synced high level people
[0:44:40] <+Double_Tap_That> @Diabetic It's part of the main story, so you will HAVE to go through it.
[0:44:41] <%VioletHeart> @Diabetic Unless you buy a jump potion to skip story content it'll always be available to you.
[0:44:41] <Graxe_> Especially considering that Ascians were able to create things from thought.
[0:44:42] <%NYCrownlessKing> wow doesnt keep you out the story. you are the main focus of the plot @Diabetic
[0:44:43] <%Diabetic> Thank you all, I have the xpac, I'm just waiting to start on a server to get it to open up
[0:44:43] <+SirBearic> i mean they basically made a self fulfilling prophecy, they believed in doomsday so their creation powers mad it happen
[0:44:46] <gekizenbu> @Diabetic there's people doing previous Xpac content all the time so you won't miss out on the content
[0:44:48] <BunnyEmperor> OH YES Pat is finally in Amaurot
[0:44:50] <cizal11> @TheImmortal70 that's what i thought at first, but that last boss's title made me think otherwise
[0:44:53] <$shadow1man9> They target the Healers
[0:44:53] <切捨御免> because it ignores aggro pat
[0:44:57] <%Fatmanjoggin> There are enemies you cant aggro
[0:44:59] <BunnyEmperor> this dungeon is one of the best there ever was
[0:45:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> This kind of feels like the End of the End.
[0:45:01] <+Dogbert24> it gimps your healers potency
[0:45:02] <SSD_Stryker> line is fixate
[0:45:05] <$valriot> You enjoying the Eclipse, @angriestpat ?
[0:45:09] <+Ace5335> applies healer debuff
[0:45:20] <Inollia> the 80 dungeon in crystarium is also pretty fucking dope
[0:45:29] <$shadow1man9> It debuffs your healer's potency
[0:45:29] <+TheImmortal70> @Cizal11 One thing is for certain, their world started coming to an end for some reason
[0:45:31] <Graxe_> The Eclipse, but worldwide
[0:45:36] <+iheartmota> so what cause amarot to end was their own powers?
[0:45:38] <+zaras00> toothworm
[0:45:41] <%MagickBurritoh> That's bad
[0:45:42] <shevan123> alRIGHT jesus those eyes
[0:45:44] <+Double_Tap_That> THE FIRST BEAST
[0:45:45] <Thalchampz> OH
[0:45:45] <snakesonabane> The Eclipse but this time the villain actually did nothing wrong
[0:45:45] <Graxe_> The First Beast
[0:45:47] <+REDtheBEAST> WutFace
[0:45:50] <BunnyEmperor> METEOR BEAST
[0:45:51] <+Estuko> WutFace
[0:45:51] <+zaras00> Yeah, basically half their population heard some sound that made em go nuts
[0:45:52] <XrosHawk> Creation powers based on imagination is a double-edged sword lol
[0:45:52] <bear_breaker20> dark souls?
[0:45:54] <+wunp_fxs> no berserk influence what so ever
[0:45:57] <%madogod> Berserk?
[0:45:58] <%blaccbird914> Hey go fight hell over there
[0:46:00] <BunnyEmperor> Dante's Inferno
[0:46:01] <+Bladehenge> This was basically what happened when a race with the power of creation begins to experience mass hysteria. Their creation powers go haywire
[0:46:01] <+Dogbert24> mouthworm
[0:46:02] <vaan_ratsbane> they got hit with calamities one on top of the others
[0:46:02] <ArcadeDomination> what's this bloodborne shit?
[0:46:03] <+zaras00> and that doesnt mesh when they start freating their worst fears
[0:46:04] <cizal11> @iheartmota something caused their world to end, and then they freaked the fuck out and caused more shit on top
[0:46:05] <+TheImmortal70> BUILT TO DIE
[0:46:07] <shevan123> this music and theming is cool as fuck
[0:46:10] <Overloard> built to die born a fuck
[0:46:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> His Stand is Death Flag
[0:46:12] <+Truthmoon> he got all them teeth 😬
[0:46:13] <bashful_bard> I think the most fascinating thing about this calamity is that Amaurot knew about this shit happening for quite a while. It's entirely possible they could have prevented this whole tragedy
[0:46:14] <%madogod> no this is Berserk as hell
[0:46:15] <Graxe_> Look, it's got mouths on its sides
[0:46:16] <cizal11> rip back to regular boss muisc lmao
[0:46:18] <ArcadeDomination> WORLD IS A FUCK
[0:46:20] <Graxe_> And butt
[0:46:24] <+Krivvan> only thing about this dungeon I don't like is the regular boss music
[0:46:29] <moogleboy1984> Bro... ther?
[0:46:30] <%SlowLikeThunder> god I never notices the mouths on it's capes while I was playing
[0:46:35] <+TheImmortal70> WORLD IS TERMINATION

[0:46:39] <Overloard> 100000000 dead ascians
[0:46:40] <%Diabetic> WTF is THAT
[0:46:44] <BunnyEmperor> Dont put the stones into the corner LUL
[0:46:45] <+iheartmota> @cizal11 thanks, whatever caused them to go mad might be the new bad guy in the future
[0:46:52] <Graxe_> Meteors, the boss

[0:47:18] <+SirBearic> well its like they explained before if you think of something else while making something it will alter the creation, so if someone making a toy though about a monster, then you have a monster

[0:47:48] <+MisterCrimson> that is some Junji Ito ass caterpillar
[0:47:49] <+Estuko> Jesus, was the pull move that guy did that rescue move I heard about??
[0:47:49] <jackythefrost> I guess Pat isnt a pro gamer afterall
[0:47:54] <SailingSaturn> it took my party 20-35 min here cirISee
[0:47:56] <vaan_ratsbane> his head looks like the summoner ARR af helmet
[0:47:58] <+MrTurtleThief> This design is so good
[0:48:01] <+Lost_Zombie> Pat learns you can't tank buildings
[0:48:01] <+TheImmortal70> At least death cured your vulnerability
[0:48:09] <BunnyEmperor> This is the part where it gets fucky
[0:48:11] <$NitronStreams> wow Pat i cant believe youre not doing it perfectly on your first attempt
[0:48:13] <cizal11> YEP
[0:48:15] <JohnO_neil> That is one hangry caterpillar
[0:48:17] <切捨御免> feels almost... apocalyptic
[0:48:19] <%Dwarven_Gaming> i mean
[0:48:19] <$KnivesEve> he just doesnt stop
[0:48:22] <alrobot2014> so something caused the ascians to freak out and their fears brought they apocalypse into existence?
[0:48:23] <%Dwarven_Gaming> the world is EXPLODING
[0:48:32] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Whatthe
[0:48:32] <Idon__> HERE IT COMES
[0:48:38] <KatabolicRage> it's really unclear what the trigger for all this was
[0:48:40] <+TheImmortal70> The world started dying and their rampant fear gave rise to beasts to herald the end, yes
[0:48:45] <cizal11> that should prob hurt the boss huh
[0:48:46] <cizal11> oh well
[0:48:57] <+TheImmortal70> Imagine a monster that is immune to the apocalypse
[0:48:59] <+Double_Tap_That> Literal living nightmares
[0:49:01] <+TheImmortal70> Oh no you created this thing
[0:49:06] <+TheImmortal70> Or roaches
[0:49:10] <+zaras00> Basically "oh shit some bad shit is going on and our 'create stuff based on your mind' magic is just cascading on itself"
[0:49:12] <+chemtrailsgaming> "Oh shit everything is super fucke-OH SHIT I MADE A BAD THING"
[0:49:13] <jackythefrost> It's 100% SMT shit since it's the peoples thoughts that created these monsters
[0:49:17] <StarMechV> I hate that it jitters
[0:49:18] <Thenuclearwalrus> Is this his first run through the dungeon?
[0:49:22] <Graxe_> Yes
[0:49:22] <+zaras00> Yep
[0:49:23] <floatRand> I think most interesting thing is that the weather is
[0:49:25] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@chemtrailsgaming) (warning)
[0:49:27] <Thenuclearwalrus> Cool
[0:49:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Everybody knows shit's FUCKED
[0:49:29] <floatRand> Because it kinda implies thing
[0:49:31] <floatRand> s
[0:49:35] <cizal11> lmao
[0:49:39] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[0:49:43] <BunnyEmperor> What do you mean, this is great LUL
[0:49:58] <Graxe_> I feel like you can make an EX fight from this thing.
[0:50:04] <+Lost_Zombie> Can't wait to see how fucked the Nier raid is gonna be after seeing what we've already got
[0:50:04] <Thenuclearwalrus> LUL
[0:50:04] <chronoxgp> god dammit it's that behemoth shit from monhun
[0:50:07] <Heldritch1> basically the world became Ill for some reason, mass hysteria and the apocalypse happens
[0:50:08] <BunnyEmperor> The second boss is not as good though
[0:50:08] <SataruYamate> you can eat the meteor with Blackest Night
[0:50:10] <+Zeromaru2> IF this is the First Beast? How many more of these are there? bitterShook
[0:50:12] <%madogod> that look super easy
[0:50:14] <+Fynale> this is the git gud expansion
[0:50:18] <+Ace5335> the it wasnt too hard
[0:50:22] <Graxe_> The First Beast fought in The First Doom
[0:50:23] <snakesonabane> no longer 420, RIP dank knight
[0:50:24] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat you're a bad? Kappa
[0:50:24] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat btw expert dungeons only give accessories
[0:50:26] <cizal11> i love the area names so fucking much
[0:50:28] <TsundereFFXIV> not i420 anymore FeelsBadMan
[0:50:29] <+mlow44> Is this actually considered a lot for a boss fight in this game? Seems pretty simple compared to some of the mechanics in, say, some of the later ESO dungeon fights
[0:50:29] <Thenuclearwalrus> @madogod You'd be surprised how many people fail easy mechanics
[0:50:32] <+Zxtole> Even my healer Trust companion died to that boss LUL
[0:50:35] <Graxe_> "Bear witness to the second doom"
[0:50:36] <shevan123> holy shit
[0:50:38] <floatRand> Pat, did you check the weather?
[0:50:43] <vaan_ratsbane> yea he did
[0:50:45] <Seraphile> 2nd beast is worst with Trust
[0:50:45] <cizal11> @AngriestPat remember to get chest, or have someone get them. you need gear
[0:50:49] <+rangriz> THE END DAYS
[0:50:51] <+TheImmortal70> Remember that picture?
[0:50:54] <ExpressNode> Hey look its Crisis City
[0:50:56] <+TheImmortal70> ENJOY IT"S REALITY
[0:51:00] <LokimenD> Look at that devil man
[0:51:01] <shevan123> i never knew the apocalypse could look so beautiful
[0:51:06] <KatabolicRage> and these are the buildings that are so amazing that they sit under the ocean and laugh at the concept of erosian
[0:51:06] <+MisterCrimson> Was that a laser dragon in the background?
[0:51:07] <%korth367> baby pulls for big babies
[0:51:07] <JohnO_neil> Shit´s on fiire, yo
[0:51:07] <+Double_Tap_That> I love how they don't even have proper names, just Terminus + concept.
[0:51:15] <+superdoomshroom> I mean it's called the Final Days for a reason
[0:51:20] <Graxe_> And remember, Yshtola was like, "The material these structures are made of are extremely durable and unknown to man"
[0:51:22] <$NitronStreams> its like dark souls bloodborne and neir all had a baby
[0:51:25] <+AverageBlubber> Terminus Shadower
[0:51:27] <+Lost_Zombie> @MisterCrimson More like a laser thing
[0:51:29] <Graxe_> Now watch them fall and break apart
[0:51:37] <+tigerfang86> pat is in eternal zen mode
[0:51:39] <floatRand> The weather here is called 'Termination'
[0:51:50] <%crowsloft77> god this makes me even more hyper for the nier raids
[0:51:55] <vaan_ratsbane> makes sense, since those towers in the upper areas of the tempest are the only thing that survived from this nightmare
[0:52:01] <Thalchampz> Nier raids are going to be so dobe
[0:52:07] <+Karasseram> terminus is greek and means at the center off
[0:52:07] <+SirBearic> this basicly an allegory of the dangers of the collective conscious
[0:52:08] <LokimenD> The weather is shit's fucked
[0:52:12] <snakesonabane> i don't get it, is this dungeon supposed to be an average day in detroit?
[0:52:25] <%crowsloft77> @snakesonabane LA since we're always on fire
[0:52:26] <KatabolicRage> the nightmare beasts are bad but I don't think they're the reason this all happened
[0:52:32] <+tigerfang86> STANDO POWER
[0:52:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> @SirBearic "That reminds me of an episode of Star Trek..."
[0:52:39] <+chemtrailsgaming> Is this post-brexit england?
[0:52:43] <JohnO_neil> Yes, David Cage is gonna show up in a minute
[0:52:45] <切捨御免> nightmare beasts are definitely just a symptom
[0:52:50] <jackythefrost> Average day of raining meteors
[0:52:54] <floatRand> I think it will be an arc in the game where we deal with this Final Days/Terminus thing again.
[0:53:00] <ExpressNode> The voice of David Cage
[0:53:04] <%weissguard> DRAGON
[0:53:04] <BunnyEmperor> IGNORE THAT
[0:53:05] <glitchedmatt1> monkaS
[0:53:06] <%NYCrownlessKing> Pat.. you're in for the best expansion ending ever @AngriestPat imo
[0:53:06] <Graxe_> Look at that thing
[0:53:10] <%vivinxs> ITS FINE
[0:53:10] <+tigerfang86> OK SURE
[0:53:12] <Thalchampz> TIAMAT?
[0:53:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yo, it's ok guys. Silver and Blaze are on this
[0:53:13] <%Valdorick> Huh, so their blood red.
[0:53:13] <%NYCrownlessKing> let me know what you think at the end

[0:53:17] <LokimenD> That's a big boy
[0:53:20] <StarMechV> aaaaà
[0:53:20] <SargentToughie> Look at this Bayonetta shit Pat
[0:53:20] <%chiluzza> you should probably stop that
[0:53:21] <reonome> heal me daddy
[0:53:22] <$valriot> Acsians got it FUCKIN BAD
[0:53:26] <%crowsloft77> where's the iblis trigger?
[0:53:27] <%chiluzza> it seems to be wreckign shit
[0:53:28] <%chiluzza> but no rush
[0:53:30] <+VidulaSaix> @NYCrownlessKing Its not. Its one of the best RPG endings ever lol
[0:53:48] <+Karasseram> this is my new fave jhrpg now
[0:53:51] <%NYCrownlessKing> well its not an official ending to the entire story. which is why i dont say that yet @VidulaSaix
[0:53:52] <+Karasseram> shb msq
[0:53:52] <+Double_Tap_That> No wonder Emet is tired. He survived this shit plus countless millenia.
[0:53:55] <+superdoomshroom> Oh i didn't even realize that these were called beholders, thats actually pretty clever
[0:53:56] <+Estuko> Kreygasm big dragon boys
[0:53:58] <XrosHawk> What's worse is that most of these monsters are only showing up because some of the ascians let the horror get to them
[0:53:59] <BunnyEmperor> cya later fuckers
[0:53:59] <+VidulaSaix> It's an ending to THIS story
[0:54:04] <snakesonabane> ultraman
[0:54:08] <BunnyEmperor> just flies up xD
[0:54:14] <bashful_bard> This is a 10/10 dungeon for real
[0:54:15] <+Double_Tap_That> This truly is the Ascians Final Fantasy.
[0:54:19] <%NYCrownlessKing> ya its an ending to an Arc.
[0:54:28] <snakesonabane> oh you think it's 10/10 already? Kappa
[0:54:29] <+Karasseram> this is the ending to ARR
[0:54:35] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[0:54:41] <Graxe_> I like how they're using the FF12 Bombs to show how monstrous this shit got when the bombs look like that
[0:54:43] <%VioletHeart> So this expansion is pretty disappointing, right?
[0:54:51] <EmoLlama97> the worst xpac
[0:54:53] <snakesonabane> yeah massive disappoint, I wanted more ala mhigo
[0:54:55] <+bizzer10> so are you just spamming the optimal attack?
[0:54:55] <jackythefrost> Wait until the 3rd part of this dungeon Kappa
[0:54:57] <%Maids4lyfe> hate it
[0:54:57] <BunnyEmperor> The music PepeHands
[0:54:57] <+VidulaSaix> Absolutely irredeemable
[0:54:58] <vaan_ratsbane> This expansion raised the bar higher than any previous patch, I'm so excited for the future of this game
[0:55:03] <+Karasseram> worst ever
[0:55:03] <%Mr_y1096> Mr_y1096 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[0:55:08] <%ArcanumMBD> Friendship ended with Heavensward, now Shadowbringers is my new best expansion
[0:55:14] <%NYCrownlessKing> i hate this expansion because pat's here
[0:55:17] <kanodin> genuinely don't know how they can top this
[0:55:18] <+Kelpus> n
[0:55:22] <+VidulaSaix> HW is still good but fuck HW compared to ShB LUL
[0:55:23] <%SlowLikeThunder> this boss is a little lame
[0:55:23] <BunnyEmperor> The second doom is basically Zerg Horde
[0:55:24] <Thenuclearwalrus> This fight is NotLikeThis
[0:55:25] <ExpressNode> Cockatrice
[0:55:27] <+MaakuOtaku> i don't either kanodin
[0:55:28] <%Fatmanjoggin> evil d o d o
[0:55:31] <+Krivvan> @bizzer10 You can't really spam any optimal attack in ff14, at the least you need to do a combination of skills
[0:55:34] <+Masutasodo> Dodo of doom
[0:55:35] <Thalchampz> of course it's a cockatrice
[0:55:37] <RavenHellkite> the filler arc
[0:55:39] <Seraphile> this fight is ass on trust system
[0:55:40] <snakesonabane> goblin chicken
[0:55:41] <+HellCopter> X-Chicken
[0:55:41] <Thenuclearwalrus> This music reminds me of Gundam Unicorn
[0:55:42] <+Double_Tap_That> I love how the objectives are "Witness" and "Endure" the dooms. It's not even telling you to beat them.
[0:55:44] <+VidulaSaix> @Krivvan I dunno have you seen new Bard Kappa
[0:55:44] <Graxe_> And then they use the FF12 Chimeras because those are really weird
[0:55:44] <JohnO_neil> It´s Plague!
[0:55:46] <ArcadeDomination> look it's the second doom game
[0:55:47] <Everdarke> This all basically happened to to mass panic combined with creation magic
[0:55:49] <zajoestar> mob boss
[0:55:49] <%RittiFruity> thic boi
[0:55:56] <vaan_ratsbane> these are the sonics of ivalice
[0:55:59] <lionsignal> Is that a chicken??
[0:56:03] <+bizzer10> oh ok
[0:56:04] <+chemtrailsgaming> Doom II: Hell on Amaurot
[0:56:09] <+tigerfang86> But with FLEX TAPE
[0:56:09] <Graxe_> Cockatrice with human face and snake tail and stuff
[0:56:14] <jackythefrost> READY FOR ADDS
[0:56:15] <bashful_bard> That's a cool opener you got there :)
[0:56:17] <XrosHawk> Every boss this expansion does a lot of damage
[0:56:19] <BunnyEmperor> Its funny that in this boss fight you dont fight the boss LUL
[0:56:21] <necroprice> i hope you like adds
[0:56:22] <+Double_Tap_That> You like adds!?
[0:56:22] <+Karasseram> the horror of add phases
[0:56:22] <%Diabetic> These are better demons than Diablo
[0:56:23] <+Zxtole> Judging by it's name, this was just a random mob. They were everywhere
[0:56:23] <%Valdorick> Chicken looks like it has Louisoix's face LUL
[0:56:28] <zajoestar> ADDS BOSS
[0:56:29] <ArcadeDomination> hope you bought an add blocker
[0:56:35] <XrosHawk> Trash mobs - THE FIGHT

[0:56:44] <+wunp_fxs> add mode engaged
[0:56:48] <zajoestar> really a dps check boss
[0:57:07] <$shadow1man9> A tank and DPS check fight

[0:59:20] <+chemtrailsgaming> Space monsters
[0:59:21] <%Diabetic> Holy Hell it's FFXI's first dragon boss
[0:59:27] <+HelloImTom08> Is this a kingdom harts game now???
[0:59:27] <ArcadeDomination> cross off that bingo card
[0:59:29] <$NitronStreams> Did Platinum design this dungeon
[0:59:31] <$SleepyMaribo> wait, aliens did it!
[0:59:33] <Graxe_> That's how bad the Ascians got it
[0:59:33] <%NYCrownlessKing> You are watching..literally the destruction..of THEIR STAR..
[0:59:36] <vaan_ratsbane> Bayonetta 3 looks dope
[0:59:37] <+Double_Tap_That> Terminus Twitcher is a great streamer tag
[0:59:38] <%NYCrownlessKing> you can see the planet literally burning
[0:59:44] <+HelloImTom08> Demons from space, just like dragons
[0:59:46] <%Lithdoran> Look at that big, four-faced bastard
[0:59:48] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:50] <+Karasseram> this is the source pre shards
[0:59:56] <Graxe_> And why the Umbral Calamities are a lesser, necessary evil to them
[0:59:59] <kanodin> living nightmares
[1:00:00] <%NYCrownlessKing> you can see the planet engulfed in flames breaking apart.
[1:00:00] <+tigerfang86> who needs FOUR HEADS
[1:00:03] <13sin> the ascians greatets fears and worst dreams
[1:00:04] <+tigerfang86> nobody needs that many
[1:00:08] <%Dwarven_Gaming> so jus imagine...WHAT caused this?
[1:00:14] <vaan_ratsbane> that's like mini barthandelus
[1:00:14] <Graxe_> "They planet's dying, Cloud."
[1:00:14] <%SlowLikeThunder> They're literally the manifestations of the fear of godlike beings
[1:00:16] <alrobot2014> redundant organs are usfeul
[1:00:18] <%Dwarven_Gaming> like, WHAT evil destoryed GODS
[1:00:19] <%Lapinelis> Talk about ending an expansion with power, eh?
[1:00:21] <sovayell> Kreygasm tune
[1:00:22] <切捨御免> oh those are ultima beams
[1:00:24] <GDandy_> The development team isn't paid nearly enough for the miracles they pulled off in ShB
[1:00:27] <BunnyEmperor> This is the best dungeon they ever made
[1:00:29] <+Double_Tap_That> @vaan_ratsbane I imagine it's just nature.
[1:00:31] <floatRand> Look, it's that meatball from before!
[1:00:31] <%Fatmanjoggin> Yeah it is gonne be tough to top this
[1:00:33] <bear_breaker20> incoming kingdom hearts Kappa
[1:00:35] <JohnO_neil> Wait, when you don´t stand in the projection until the attack you ae fine if you walk into it?
[1:00:36] <Thenuclearwalrus> I think what caused this was creation magic run rampant @Dwarven_Gaming
[1:00:38] <%Mev852_> This is so damn cool.
[1:00:39] <vaan_ratsbane> Catastrophe monkaS
[1:00:44] <+Double_Tap_That> Then the Ascian's powers magnified the terror.
[1:00:45] <ClumzyDragon> YAY
[1:00:45] <%DeadStage> but how can we breathe in space
[1:00:46] <%chiluzza> did he stop the manticore
[1:00:46] <KatabolicRage> no there was some catalyst to set this off
[1:00:47] <%Dwarven_Gaming> but WHY
[1:00:48] <pectusumbra> and just think, this isn't the shit yoko taro made either
[1:00:49] <Daxalog> Why does the damage get applied before the particle plays?
[1:00:50] <%korth367> bosses coming back as regular mobs is the best shit
[1:00:53] <+Estuko> does it have no eye? monkaS
[1:00:56] <Mastigias> This music is BANGING
[1:00:57] <SailingSaturn> its also looks like a boss from Deltascape cirISee
[1:00:59] <Forester_Skippy> flesy member but weaker
[1:01:01] <TootWootKeza> Ascians like their DnD Kappa
[1:01:05] <+Estuko> Oh just a tiny one lol
[1:01:11] <baronvonkame> some attacks take a snapshot of where you were when you go off, as long as you aren't in the orange zone when it goes off it's fine
[1:01:17] <cizal11> @JohnO_neil pretty much yeah. the visuals of the actual attack aren't important,
[1:01:17] <13sin> @Dwarven_Gaming literally their magic out of control did this. every stray thought they had, especially he bad ones, became real. and the bad ones caused a cascadingeffect where more bad things where thought up as a result.
[1:01:20] <Thenuclearwalrus> LUL
[1:01:21] <+tigerfang86> ANTI SPIRALS
[1:01:21] <%Valdorick> "But Emet, I don't want an umbral calamity" "Son! Back in my day! They were just Calamities! And were grateful for them! We had 1, and half our people died to stop it! Then we killed another half to fix what the Calamity did! Now shut up and eat your 13 umbrals!"
[1:01:22] <glitchedmatt1> YES
[1:01:22] <shevan123> hahaha
[1:01:23] <+wunp_fxs> LUL
[1:01:25] <%demegodz> Makes sense
[1:01:25] <$NitronStreams> LUL
[1:01:25] <切捨御免> LUL
[1:01:26] <+iheartmota> ANTI SPIRALS
[1:01:27] <shevan123> HAHAH ITS TRUE
[1:01:27] <Thalchampz> YUUUUP
[1:01:27] <zerokingkh3> LUL
[1:01:28] <%NYCrownlessKing> BREAK THE HEAVENS
[1:01:28] <+Angrec> @AngriestPat there is a GREAT post on reddit how this entire dungeon is a reference to a book by thomas moore called utopia. its really neat supposedly all of the sin eater stuff is also tied to the scions and the sin eaters all all based on plato's virtues
[1:01:28] <vaan_ratsbane> HOLY SHIT
[1:01:28] <Thenuclearwalrus> ROW ROW
[1:01:30] <StarMechV> END OF FINAL FANTASY: You Can(NOT) Adventure
[1:01:30] <%crowsloft77> yep
[1:01:32] <ClumzyDragon> row row fight the power \o/
[1:01:34] <ArcadeDomination> yeyeyeyeyeye
[1:01:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> narutoooo
[1:01:43] <%crowsloft77> You're gonna love the ending then
[1:01:43] <shevan123> thats what this music was reminding me of
[1:01:46] <%NYCrownlessKing> TELL THAT TO WOOLIE AND YOU'LL SELL HIM lol @AngriestPat
[1:01:49] <%demegodz> This shit is full anime right now
[1:01:50] <+TheImmortal70> The saddest part of this is that they had NO CHOICE
[1:01:58] <glitchedmatt1> This whole ending is Gurren Lagann basically
[1:01:59] <snakesonabane> @crowsloft77 exactly what I was thinking, the finale is straight out of TTGL
[1:02:00] <+TheImmortal70> They had no choice but summon Zodiark and start this whole shit show
[1:02:00] <%NYCrownlessKing> you might finally know pat the easiest way to bullshit Woolie int oFF14
[1:02:03] <+Double_Tap_That> You Can(NOT) Pay My Sub
[1:02:04] <+Karasseram> this had to summon zodiark
[1:02:05] <%NYCrownlessKing> "you fight the anti-spirals"
[1:02:08] <%Lapinelis> This is stupidly jRPG/ANIME and IT"S FUCKING GREAT
[1:02:10] <+Karasseram> there was no other way
[1:02:22] <+Double_Tap_That> @Karasseram No, they summoned Zodiark to stop this. And it worked.
[1:02:25] <JohnO_neil> When a millio catboys populate the earth they will return
[1:02:26] <StarMechV> WOW WISHES a dungeon like this
[1:02:28] <gekizenbu> the most Final Fantasy 14 has ever been aind its Great
[1:02:28] <ArcadeDomination> a race that seals itself away and has a big entity that represents it, checks out
[1:02:30] <Graxe_> And remember, Emet-Selch created all of this just to show you how bad it was.
[1:02:36] <%ArcanumMBD> Yeah that'll go great. "woolie just play 100 hours of this MMO to get to the part where the antispirals show up for a single dungeon"
[1:02:40] <+Artemis_Scowl> this is just some Studio Trigger shit. absolutely amazing
[1:02:44] <切捨御免> yeah probably
[1:02:45] <+Karasseram> Double_Tap_That I typed this instead of they derp
[1:02:47] <+TheImmortal70> It might
[1:02:48] <kanodin> mmhm
[1:02:49] <+wunp_fxs> probably
[1:02:51] <SailingSaturn> We don't know what happened cirISee
[1:02:55] <Graxe_> But Zodiark, though
[1:02:57] <13sin> probably
[1:02:57] <snakesonabane> it could happen in the shards as well, shit's fucked
[1:02:59] <cizal11> @AngriestPat in theory that's what zodiark isfor
[1:02:59] <Everdarke> Not with zodiark to keep them in check
[1:03:01] <Graxe_> He'll stop it
[1:03:01] <%ArcanumMBD> Well no, the idea is that Zodiark stopped this
[1:03:01] <bashful_bard> They let this happen
[1:03:02] <KatabolicRage> it's unclear what started it but zodiaaark
[1:03:03] <%crowsloft77> wanna make your ending great...go to space
[1:03:03] <13sin> since they never figured out what caused it right?
[1:03:03] <Seraphile> @AngriestPat no, because Zodiark tempered them
[1:03:04] <%Ranryu692> they'll deal with that when they get to it
[1:03:04] <baronvonkame> Anyone else agree this boss is basically CLASH from jojo?
[1:03:05] <+Zxtole> As long as Zodiark can save them from it
[1:03:06] <$shadow1man9> We still don't know what STARTED it
[1:03:09] <+VidulaSaix> But they didnt cause this Pat
[1:03:11] <+TheImmortal70> Which is why they CAN"T win
[1:03:13] <%TaifuDragon> This is pre-Zodiark
[1:03:14] <Graxe_> Just sacrifice half of the population to power Zodiark
[1:03:15] <%Fatmanjoggin> Look at that moon presence
[1:03:17] <%TaifuDragon> They fixed it
[1:03:18] <+JayNyne> they don't know what caused it
[1:03:19] <+Angrec> @AngriestPat also that giant sphinx thing is supposed to be the riddle of what happens when you die. like they were all thinking about what happens after they die and that thing spawned from it
[1:03:19] <KatabolicRage> I think all we ever get is a great sound from under the earth starting driving people mad or something
[1:03:20] <%Diabetic> yeah what happened
[1:03:20] <%Valdorick> Think about it, a world were fake news creates end of the world because a 12 year old thinks about what would happen if a meteor hit his house.
[1:03:21] <MagicMuffinx> Kill Zodiark and kill Hydaelyn
[1:03:24] <fehraf> wait I was gone for a bit what did I miss
[1:03:24] <+TheImmortal70> They'll just keep making sacrifices to Zodiark over and over and over to avert this shit
[1:03:25] <vaan_ratsbane> it's ambiguous so we have an enemy to fight post-ascians
[1:03:30] <floatRand> Possibly. Their plan has basically two BUTs: 1. Zodiark will require sustenance as a primal. 2. Prevention of further end days might cause things.
[1:03:32] <Daxalog> Whats that bblue meter at the top?
[1:03:33] <cizal11> it does
[1:03:34] <kaze7897> Zodiark worked
[1:03:34] <cizal11> a lot
[1:03:34] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat this isn't their fault. It was some unknown thing that caused these things to spew from their creation magics
[1:03:38] <kaze7897> But it was costly
[1:03:39] <+VidulaSaix> Bur Zodiark worked
[1:03:40] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:03:43] <bestwaifuritsu> Garleans aint SHIT compared to this
[1:03:46] <+TheImmortal70> Welcome to their argument
[1:03:48] <%shootbang_exe> shootbang_exe subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:03:53] <StarMechV> This Isnt the solution Pat
[1:03:53] <+Karasseram> the ascians are gods
[1:03:56] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat Can't you summon your stand at this level now?
[1:03:56] <Heldritch1> I think that they belive if they just keep powering Zodiark it will be fine
[1:03:56] <%DeadStage> Zodiark was the answer until someone decided to protest against it
[1:03:56] <+iheartmota> Well it worked but the means
[1:03:57] <+Double_Tap_That> >Zodiark and the Ascians did nothing wrong.
[1:03:57] <%crowsloft77> god if Lahabrea and emit join us in the final expac I'll lose my shit
[1:03:58] <+TheImmortal70> It's either the full end or a shitty solution
[1:03:59] <snakesonabane> their solution worked, you try thinking of a better one with days to live
[1:03:59] <%Cn_alpha_02> Zoidarck was specifically created to prevent this from happening again.
[1:03:59] <+Karasseram> not fake summoned gods
[1:04:00] <+HelloImTom08> you would think all powerful gods would be smart but no LUL
[1:04:00] <pectusumbra> @Valdorick that exists more or less, it's called Good Omens

[1:04:20] <+Masutasodo> This boss fight is hella good
[1:04:21] <XyraFhoan> considering Ascian creation powers used aether, it could very well be possible that they caused this to happen to their own world

[1:05:30] <ShichiNoBushi> This seems closer in aesthetic to Bayonetta angels than Lovecraftian.
[1:05:32] <Graxe_> Chthonic is Greek for "of the underworld" or something similar.

[1:06:49] <%SlowLikeThunder> It's ultra-beam attack is called APOKOLIPS
[1:06:50] <+rei0> it's demon wall
[1:06:51] <Everdarke> This boss is basically what people feared the strange voice they heard from under ground would be. And their creation magic made it manifest. And when people saw this creature they felt terror which created more of the monsters. And it kept happening untill the world got overwhelmed
[1:06:51] <BunnyEmperor> Such a great way to make a dps check
[1:06:53] <%DeadStage> Pat, you can blackest night + dark mind and tank that giant beam with 0 damage
[1:06:54] <%crowsloft77> there's two platforms next to it
[1:06:55] <+Estuko> monkaS that probably killed a planet or two
[1:06:56] <reonome> is this the demon wall
[1:06:57] <ExpressNode> The Death wall
[1:06:59] <%chiluzza> thats a new FFXIV mechanic

[1:10:21] <+chemtrailsgaming> can you actually time this boss out?
[1:10:21] <+SirBearic> the dps check is to kill it before the safe spots all break
[1:10:24] <+VidulaSaix> Apok will kill them
[1:10:25] <zajoestar> dps check
[1:10:27] <+VidulaSaix> See the platforms
[1:10:27] <%NWR_James> So is this basically a race?
[1:10:29] <%Diabetic> apatDab
[1:10:31] <$shadow1man9> You do run out of platforms to dodge the big laser however
[1:10:32] <$Yakobro> there is a soft enrage though in that you can run out of platforms for the big beam
[1:10:35] <Thenuclearwalrus> He doesnt do another jump, but Apok is destroying the platforms
[1:10:40] <SailingSaturn> @SirBearic well theres another way for that LUL

[1:56:01] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat So one of the side dungeons you can unlock now has the best song in the game
[1:56:02] <+sixcubit> how the hell do you raise the stakes next expansion from THIS?

[1:56:13] <KatabolicRage> it's not over until you hand in the MSQ buddy
[1:56:15] <Heyestus> So how does it stack up against the previous expansions @AngriestPat
[1:56:15] <koolaid_kevster> we did it together
[1:56:16] <%Ragnarok_Flames> Ragnarok_Flames subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:56:22] <cizal11> @sixcubit it's EXTREMELY unclear lol
[1:56:25] <Thenuclearwalrus> @sixcubit Going to the moon!
[1:56:26] <kaze7897> ShB > HW > SB > ARR
[1:56:27] <tmo200> That was dope
[1:56:30] <ChoculaUltra> I hope Urianger keeps the goggle-less look back in the Source tbh. UrianBAE.
[1:56:31] <+TheImmortal70> The technical answer is ARR because this wouldn't exist without it, but Shadowbringers is the best hands down
[1:56:33] <Valsera> now skip
[1:56:34] <%Valdorick> Emet. Did! NOTHING. WRONG!
[1:56:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm so glad I tuned in all these days

[1:56:43] <BunnyEmperor> Agreed
[1:56:43] <+Nenuvar> I thought nothing could ever, every replace Chains of Promathia as my favorite FF MMORPG expansion. SHB beat it handsdown.
[1:56:45] <+Ell1ot> i remember that getting to the end of a WoW story was harder because you needed a big raid group
[1:56:47] <FalseEyeD> We can only hope this is the end
[1:56:47] <%some_sunflowers> Pat: Best part of ShB story?
[1:56:51] <BlacSoul> Only 2 characters had normal hair

[1:59:13] <snakesonabane> The Scions gave Emet shit for trying to kill everyone to bring back his dead friends but Graha did the EXACT same thing by time traveling since the old timeline and everyone in it is dead now, they even acknowledge that it's a big price to pay
[1:59:17] <Overloard> BIG RVIL

[2:00:40] <snakesonabane> @Thenuclearwalrus But then either the old universe is alive and the new one is a branch that split which makes the original plan to prevent tragedy useless or only the exarch is alive

[2:01:49] <+Dogbert24> "you're all trapped here until the next expansion, deal with it"
[2:01:49] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> They need to figure out what to do with their original bodies in the source anyways
[2:01:49] <Thenuclearwalrus> WoL/D can still go back to the source
[2:01:52] <gekizenbu> Zenos (EX)
[2:01:54] <bearalin> Gosh when they get back everything will probably be fucked
[2:01:56] <Heldritch1> BUT... but, r-race war?
[2:01:59] <%Deft_Thought> Gosh what good pals
[2:02:00] <+TheImmortal70> it's assumed that because Graha was suffering from GUN, he couldn't help teleport him

[2:04:26] <+CaptainLoin> Graha is the biggest WoL fanboy
[2:04:33] <+chemtrailsgaming> Remember Fordola? neither do i
[2:04:33] <%Lapinelis> Oh right, you have one more job quest to do
[2:04:34] <%TombstoneTTromboners> understandable
[2:04:35] <+TheImmortal70> Second biggest
[2:04:37] <FalseEyeD> Neil Ryne
[2:04:37] <+TheImmortal70> He hasn't died for us yet
[2:04:38] <Huntercd> Where is his tail?
[2:04:42] <+CaptainLoin> oof
[2:04:44] <%Lapinelis> Remember how square said no more job quests? THEY LIED
[2:04:44] <Seraphile> I want Fordola to be relevant
[2:04:50] <+Estuko> just, steal Baseball and fucking book it through the portal
[2:04:50] <snakesonabane> @AngriestPat This is a reverse isekai where the protagonist summoned his favorite anime character into his world
[2:04:52] <BappoSama> That hat is the dopest
[2:04:53] <SSD_Stryker> graha is such a good boy
[2:04:54] <+Karasseram> graha has had a crush on us for 300 years
[2:04:55] <Seraphile> I want Fordola in Trust
[2:04:57] <Bielzitcho> who would you pick, chat? g'raha or aymeric?
[2:05:00] <MasterDecoder> Earring worse than Hat
[2:05:01] <Foggysheep> his boner will not be denied
[2:05:03] <%TombstoneTTromboners> nah it's just under the robes
[2:05:03] <+chemtrailsgaming> under the robe proly
[2:05:04] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it's probably under the robes
[2:05:05] <+Templar15> it's just hiding
[2:05:06] <Daxalog> TAIL MAD
[2:05:06] <waifoong98> it got cut prob?
[2:05:06] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat there's a bigger fanboy of yours :)
[2:05:07] <BunnyEmperor> He is the only cat who can pluck his tail under his robes Pat
[2:05:07] <Inollia> maybe it became crystal and broke ?
[2:05:08] <+superdoomshroom> It's just under the robe
[2:05:09] <SailingSaturn> Probably just tied it up
[2:05:10] <%demegodz> Nope, can't follow
[2:05:10] <ChoculaUltra> his tail turned into crystal and snapped off after sitting down too fast.
[2:05:11] <+HelloImTom08> tucked it in like a penis
[2:05:11] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat He'd be really disappointed if he knew you just saw loot, and gear score.
[2:05:13] <%Roundelay11> Maybe it crystallized and fell off
[2:05:13] <floatRand> it fell off
[2:05:13] <KatabolicRage> I guess the tail would have made is more obvious than it already was
[2:05:15] <SataruYamate> that or its hidden to its not obvious its Graha tia, even tho it is
[2:05:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> His tail would be a huge giveaway
[2:05:18] <glitchedmatt1> Can't have two graha's in the same time/shard LUL
[2:05:26] <Heldritch1> he cant show in the model, it would give it away
[2:05:27] <+Namboto> I can hear him lifting his tail for you right now
[2:05:30] <gekizenbu> "Hey yo past me WAKE THE FUCK UP"
[2:05:34] <snakesonabane> The two Grahas will meet and melt into menger sponges
[2:05:34] <KatabolicRage> his goddamn jaw was a huge giveaway anyways, everyone who's seen catboys knew it was him
[2:05:35] <snowmanse> If you didn't do Crystal Tower, this would've been the big name reveal.
[2:05:46] <+REDtheBEAST> wait WHAT!
[2:05:47] <FalseEyeD> Anime Cat Boy streamed the whole game

[2:05:57] <BunnyEmperor> OH NO I FORGOT
[2:05:59] <%BlueMoonBlues> The one in the Source

[2:09:54] <+AverageBlubber> I saw some folks were disappointed about Zenos here being back. But as someone who shotgunned all of Stormblood in like a week I like him well enough
[2:09:55] <+chemtrailsgaming> The echo is the power to reconstitute reality
[2:09:56] <+TheImmortal70> Or grandson or whatever
[2:09:58] <+Fynale> @ChoculaUltra cuz everyone with the echo can do that, the ascians have the echo too

[2:13:14] <%BlueMoonBlues> The race war ends now
[2:13:17] <+chemtrailsgaming> DA HOONT
[2:13:17] <%Valdorick> The real Race War was the Race War between God and Man
[2:13:17] <CrypticMochi> So next expansion is a gurren lagann galaxy battle?
[2:13:17] <%SlowLikeThunder> Zenos is the BIG HERO now, stopped the Ultimate Bio-Weapon
[2:13:18] <%TaifuDragon> Does this mean even if we failed
[2:13:19] <arkv01> big ol green check mark
[2:13:22] <%TaifuDragon> Zenos would have solved the problem
[2:13:22] <Graxe_> Zenos traded in Race War for worldwide combat tournament
[2:13:23] <Heldritch1> PRIMAL HOONT

[2:18:22] <+DAIROCKETTO> time ofr the big FFVIII reference

[2:18:36] <+Namboto> father daughter road trip~
[2:18:43] <%demon_shadowplays> this game should have a leveling system where your spouse lvls up along side you online or off..
[2:18:43] <zajoestar> FF* Eden
[2:18:44] <%Deft_Thought> Uhhhh
[2:18:56] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Coming in 2 weeks
[2:19:05] <%BlueMoonBlues> Where's NieR tho?
[2:19:07] <Angry_Ev1L> Eden is a motherfucking space fortress
[2:19:11] <%Jarvanii> this trust leveling system is baffling
[2:19:11] <gekizenbu> all your friends are at level 70 unforunately
[2:19:16] <+lucaflow> "Hmmmm the Warriors of Darkness didn't work.. I KNOW I'll send the Warriors of Light against them!!!"
[2:19:17] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Nier in 3-4 months-ish
[2:19:18] <切捨御免> DO IT
[2:19:20] <+TheImmortal70> Trust leveling is crazy
[2:19:21] <%Jarvanii> it must only be implemented to force you to use duty finder
[2:19:21] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> 5.1
[2:19:21] <ZaDoorman> so is Ryne like the daughter of Minfilia and Thancred?
[2:19:21] <FalseEyeD> NieR comes in 5.1 patch
[2:19:25] <%NYCrownlessKing> grab the quest in the Crystarium @AngriestPat
[2:19:36] <kaze7897> You gotta go to Foundation at the Forgotten Knight Pat for the DRK Job

[2:20:11] <%BlueMoonBlues> @AngriestPat Sidurgu
[2:20:11] <snowmanse> That is bizarre to me. You have to relevel trusts even though they automatically levelled for the story trusts.

[2:20:55] <%Jarvanii> I heard this one is actually interesting
[2:20:56] <%Lapinelis> And title
[2:21:00] <%SlowLikeThunder> the 80 Paladin job quest is hilarious
[2:21:05] <SataruYamate> its a very convuluted quest but its story is good
[2:21:06] <FalseEyeD> Back to some good music
[2:21:07] <%BlueMoonBlues> @chemtrailsgaming lvl viii materia

[2:21:17] <+CaptainLoin> WHM's was eh. was nice to reconnect, but was basically nothing
[2:21:18] <切捨御免> As always with drk quests, be sure to read the journal
[2:21:34] <%Lapinelis> Everything on Eorzea is a ghost town, everyone went to the source
[2:21:35] <BlacSoul> i miss the colors
[2:21:42] <vaan_ratsbane> Sidurgu's in Smash PogChamp
[2:21:44] <Monkeyweed21> Why is Pat still wearing that uggo hat
[2:21:45] <SataruYamate> its been 1000 years
[2:22:13] <%Deft_Thought> He wants to look like his idol, Tataru
[2:22:14] <Thalchampz> shut up the hat's great
[2:22:19] <alrobot2014> explain it to him with hype music
[2:22:19] <+chemtrailsgaming> "So then I punched god in the face"
[2:22:23] <ShichiNoBushi> In excruciating detail.

[2:23:35] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat thats his wife right?
[2:23:39] <jackythefrost> All of the major DRK quests start with the word "Our"
[2:23:40] <+TheImmortal70> Minfilia has been gone practically, and who cares about them
