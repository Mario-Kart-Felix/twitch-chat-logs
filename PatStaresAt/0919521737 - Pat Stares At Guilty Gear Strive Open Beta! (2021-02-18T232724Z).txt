[0:13:47] <%CalderGaming> so what will we do for the next 3 hours 20 minutes
[0:13:48] <metaphase72> When can you download the beta if you didn’t preorder?
[0:13:50] <DaKnightWarrior> hope so
[0:13:51] <%DianaTheAscian> 3
[0:13:55] <+ArsCaelia> wait i thought beta was just for ps4/ps5?
[0:13:55] <+LastHazzerd> Paddy luck
[0:13:59] <armchairmaster_> Is the beta still not available for non-preorder players?
[0:14:03] <%Chichen> yup
[0:14:05] <%CapnClassix> Yep, totes feel that
[0:14:06] <%Chichen> 100%
[0:14:07] <TopTierHarley> agreed
[0:14:09] <+itsgundamu> "Works for me"
[0:14:11] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[0:14:13] <ape_hawk> WORKS FINE FOR ME
[0:14:14] <%tizz86> yeah, pretty infuriating
[0:14:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ayo we streaming strive, the servers got fixed? very nice
[0:14:16] <%nanaki_ff14> I feel like that always happens to me!
[0:14:17] <+jiggy_snipe> "works for us" Kappa
[0:14:17] <%logoth_> No Pat, the worst is "IT WORKS FINE FOr mEE"
[0:14:19] <+TaylOctopus91> I couldn't get it either still
[0:14:21] <%CalderGaming> @ArsCaelia this driver issue is for the stream PC
[0:14:22] <%AkronymCLT> Been having that with ME1 on PC
[0:14:22] <+Skelegroove> I had that problem with a corrupted internet adapter
[0:14:23] <+karmahoudini_guitar> or you find a 7 year old forum thread and someone just says "never mind, I fixed it"
[0:14:24] <heartlesshealer> "works for me" is a CURSE
[0:14:25] <wujak> @armchairmaster_ no, but its also just down for the preorders too
[0:14:25] <astrophizz> "I found a solution, thanks" also sucks
[0:14:26] <MikeyxStyles> general open beta is available at 10pm est
[0:14:28] <peachy996> "works on my machine :)"
[0:14:29] <%CapnClassix> I didn't even realize it was my drivers until you talked about it on stream
[0:14:33] <$Futurecity10> I really hope they patch the bullshit in nioh 2 soon
[0:14:37] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Oh, so Capcom had a whole Retro marathon, cool!
[0:14:43] <%caramelatte1> AMD vs Unity engine, nobody knows what the fuck is going on with the GPU burning itself out.
[0:14:54] <%baka_sugoi> YUP
[0:14:57] <+NaLLex9> rad
[0:14:58] <%logoth_> little hitmen
[0:15:00] <ape_hawk> WERE GONNA HIT ON SOME MANS??
[0:15:03] <%kewlmyc> Going to be a long 4 hours
[0:15:03] <%CalderGaming> the BAIT AND SWITCH Kappa
[0:15:04] <%sweetestbeefs> oh boy, Hit the Mans!
[0:15:05] <SunsetJack> I think it went down due to technical reasons?
[0:15:06] <ToneBacas> i have an old laptop with what I assume is a faulty GPU (also by Nvidia, no less) and TDR is fucking awful shit
[0:15:06] <heartlesshealer> oh dang, open beta at some point for a fighting game, neat!
[0:15:08] <+BusterRepukken> IOI fixed the Hitman 2 carry over stuff.
[0:15:08] <old_dog_god> Don’t worry my gpu shit itself but all I had to do was buy a whole new gpu
[0:15:09] <nivlac_555> ?
[0:15:11] <DaKnightWarrior> nice!
[0:15:13] <socratetris> Hitman is a different game than Touchwoman
[0:15:13] <%DianaTheAscian> oh thats what hes doing
[0:15:14] <jaggstar2020> Hit me with some Beta Servers, man
[0:15:14] <%danpc5> ET
[0:15:14] <Hanzmolman> is that when the general pop gets the beta?
[0:15:15] <%bigfastkaratedealership> Man hitter
[0:15:18] <metaphase72> The worst is when you have a tech issue and then u#you search it up and find another person has the same question, but then he comments that he figured it out without saying what he did
[0:15:19] <Crowroost> WHO DARES ENTER THE HITMAN?
[0:15:19] <TopTierHarley> how was your first experience
[0:15:20] <%MrGuy516> IO Interactive fixed the level importing for Hitman 3 PC.
[0:15:24] <%sweetestbeefs> 1 mach then
[0:15:24] <LordLicoriceDerp> it's 6:42pm EST right now for reference
[0:15:24] <+itsgundamu> so 5 min

[0:15:26] <TopTierHarley> @Hanzmolman yea
[0:15:27] <ape_hawk> so for 30 minutes?
[0:15:27] <%tizz86> ps4 and some ihg internet connections don't play nice. feel like I'm the only person it affects.
[0:15:28] <%kewlmyc> Was that a stroke?
[0:15:31] <%FacetiousAF> woo 3 hour stream Kappa
[0:15:31] <%SaiyanShoto> I wanna get beat up by Pat in strive
[0:15:33] <+Patch_TheSquid> you summabitch lmao
[0:15:34] <armchairmaster_> Hitman, the game you can ACTUALLY play without weird limited timeframes

[0:15:34] <Jaysky> So we're gonna see 2 whole matches?

[0:15:53] <%baka_sugoi> Mash BUTTONS
[0:15:57] <oniwahoo> Is the amount of time till you get tired dependant on how well you're doing?
[0:15:57] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt By the by dude, do you recommend getting Strive now or when it comes out?
[0:16:00] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt Have you figured out whether your stick works on PS5?
[0:16:02] <Crowroost> d... do combo? BibleThump

With that out of the way, your Bionic Commando: No-Death-Run was perfect. The only thing more perfect is gonna be that Perfect you're gonna have in your very first Strive match! Enjoy your undefeated streak!
[0:16:03] <ExpressNode> The fate rests on one guy

[0:16:21] <wujak> @PatStaresAt now that you can import hitman 1 and 2 levels to 3 on pc, are you doing that, or still holding out for 3 coming to steam
[0:16:22] <%bigfastkaratedealership> Is hitman still buggy as fuck for anyone else? I’ve been getting detected through walls and shit
[0:16:25] <%Eaglestrike117> WELCOME TO OUR HOUSE

[0:16:54] <+pr_illuminati> Crazy
[0:16:56] <%MrGuy516> Best online fighting game right now.
[0:17:02] <Jaysky> I saw Max play against a guy in Brazil.
[0:17:04] <heartlesshealer> the game being playable online is blood in the water for GG veterans
[0:17:05] <Jaysky> It worked
[0:17:06] <old_dog_god> I play Axl and all I want is kill
[0:17:07] <Rojahh> Majinobama out there hunting influencers

[0:17:09] <+SoySocks> they FINALLY did it
[0:17:16] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, Im SO glad the online is good
[0:17:18] <+pr_illuminati> Brazillian Kens free at last
[0:17:22] <oniwahoo> I don't know what roll back frames of 0 or 1 means, but I think it's good?
[0:17:23] <+McSoliace> max was playing a guy in france
[0:17:23] <+Patch_TheSquid> you should check out +R
[0:17:26] <+b_aleph> I'm brazilia, you called?
[0:17:31] <OkamiDude15> the day is saved once again thanks to ROLLBACK NETCODE
[0:17:31] <chll0ne> guilty gear doing the ppl good
[0:17:37] <%DianaTheAscian> Woolie played a lot of Japanese players on his stream
[0:17:41] <Nit3Vizion> I don't ay fighting games but I want to fighting game this fighting games.
[0:17:47] <Nit3Vizion> play*
[0:17:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's so sad
[0:17:53] <+ALazo> Forget about other countries. More like same zip code.
[0:17:55] <Jaysky> Eeyup
[0:17:56] <Meltgar> True
[0:17:57] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt That's honestly why I didn't keep playing Gran Blue/DBZ/UNISTCLR, I loved those games but the online was ROUGH
[0:18:01] <+b_aleph> Woolie played journalists in his stream
[0:18:04] <Crowroost> @PatStaresAt did you hear bout the rumor of Persona 5r coming to PC as EGS exclusive and why is the world a fuck?
[0:18:04] <DaKnightWarrior> too bad that lobby is trash.
[0:18:06] <+b_aleph> korean journalists
[0:18:12] <jaggstar2020> We struck good online
[0:18:14] <+moonxbearx> gran blue is so fun yet another game plauged by bad networking
[0:18:17] <%baka_sugoi> Strive changing the game on NETPLAY
[0:18:19] <Jaysky> I've got fiber and play with a friend who also has fiber and it['s still a bad connection
[0:18:23] <+BusterRepukken> to bad GG's lobby system is garbage, its so bad.
[0:18:27] <%zeroarturia> Didn't Woolie fight a Japanese vtuber?
[0:18:29] <%DianaTheAscian> skilled korean jounalists
[0:18:33] <%AncelDeLambert> that's IN THE ROOM
[0:18:35] <+McSoliace> it literally is
[0:18:36] <chll0ne> @busterrepukken true
[0:18:40] <$Futurecity10> yeah woolie fought Shien
[0:18:40] <Jaysky> @zeroarturia Yes
[0:18:44] <+Patch_TheSquid> ah yes, because the wack lobby ruins the whole game. throw the whole thing out because i don't like an OPTIONAL lobby. you
[0:18:48] <+gantz_zero> @zeroarturia his first online match was that, yeah
[0:18:49] <TheImmortal70> Local is now your country
[0:18:52] <@SoFarFetched> @Crowroost but it has a release date on steam.
[0:18:53] <%aishman> @zeroarturia DID HE?!
[0:18:53] <%MrGuy516> GG Rollback has made me cry tears of joy.
[0:18:53] <+b_aleph> the korean journalism scene is REAL
[0:18:59] <majindusto> Woolie fought two Holostars
[0:19:01] <+Erictron4000> It’s 2-3 frames of delay
[0:19:01] <%Hasmeister96> Can someone translate the technical terms that Pat is saying?
[0:19:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @BusterRepukken that lobby system is some serious ass, but I guess at least the game is playable
[0:19:04] <TopTierHarley> The guy, Zinac, who did the KI netcode, helped with the GG rollback @PatStaresAt
[0:19:07] <%aishman> Woaaa
[0:19:08] <Jaysky> Woolie almost got him in the first game, lost by a sliver
[0:19:09] <+b_aleph> hi, I'm brazil
[0:19:12] <chll0ne> i do miss xrds lobby system
[0:19:12] <$Futurecity10> Wait, who was the second holostar
[0:19:19] <+pr_illuminati> UK fans who have been desperate to interact with you and Woolie now can which is sick
[0:19:20] <chll0ne> actually i prefer it
[0:19:21] <%DianaTheAscian> @majindusto did he win?
[0:19:22] <%LeiaSkynoober> Is the open beta for Strive just PS4?
[0:19:29] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Is pat into a fighting game?
[0:19:30] <+karmahoudini_guitar> what is a holostar
[0:19:30] <+BusterRepukken> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ yeah once you get a match going, its all roses but you have to jump through so many hoops to get there
[0:19:30] <Giztech> Australia will never have this :(
[0:19:35] <chll0ne> no ps4/ps5
[0:19:43] <+SoySocks> @A_DEAD_SHOW Guilty Gear Strive
[0:19:43] <old_dog_god> You aren’t ready for my Brazilian Brain Blast
[0:19:43] <%DianaTheAscian> it impressive
[0:19:46] <+itsgundamu> You are going to Brazil
[0:19:46] <+b_aleph> I have a shitty connection!
[0:19:52] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Yeah I'm totally getting it on the PS4 then (thank god they're doing that free PS5 upgrade.)
[0:19:55] <Lancaster_H> @karmahoudini_guitar hololive's male division
[0:20:00] <+jiggy_snipe> that's why rollback is so important cuz of the shitty connections
[0:20:01] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt I swear if KOF XV doesn't have rollback...
[0:20:02] <OkamiDude15> @Patch_TheSquid the quick match option still has you in the lobby readying up for a match, you just dont see it. least the online is good tho
[0:20:02] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> @SoySocks i know the game I just meant will he play it?
[0:20:07] <%baka_sugoi> Lobby is BUTT
[0:20:08] <+McSoliace> yeah lobby sucks
[0:20:14] <SunsetJack> Too late.

[0:20:29] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> fuuuuuuuuuu
[0:20:30] <+b_aleph> The PS4 costs double the PC version in Brazil
[0:20:31] <Meltgar> FGC is more Console
[0:20:31] <%MrGuy516> Not until crossplay is added.
[0:20:32] <%baka_sugoi> CONCOLES BBY
[0:20:32] <Daxalog> Your gonna be dealing with the killers on PC
[0:20:32] <+itsgundamu> still getting it on PC
[0:20:32] <dante_9x> maybe in the future
[0:20:34] <+Deko_> well too bad i like my personal computer videogames
[0:20:35] <SunsetJack> Most of the Montreal community is getting on PC Pat.
[0:20:37] <Zombrocom> Crossplay is the new drum we must bang on
[0:20:38] <+shad8snake> hopefully they add pc crossplay too
[0:20:38] <Mysticnamja> nah fuck psn
[0:20:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> welp, guess it's off to the pc gulag for me
[0:20:42] <+McSoliace> pc might get crossplay but don't get your hopes up
[0:20:44] <Animal_Farm4> There will still be people on PC, just fewer
[0:20:46] <Vashido22> same in argentina
[0:20:47] <+jiggy_snipe> if it gets patched in ever, sure get it then
[0:20:49] <BluBox> PC version will be fine, come on
[0:20:50] <+Patch_TheSquid> @OkamiDude15 but you'll be able to also que while in training in the full release
[0:20:52] <%SomersaultJustice> didn't they say they were gonna try to add crossplay in the future? or was that something else
[0:20:53] <ABootlegPerson> PC version will have less wifi users
[0:20:53] <%Nekros4442> At least not yet. PC crossplay has been said to be coming after release
[0:20:53] <TheImmortal70> Fuck quebec
[0:20:53] <%logoth_> lol
[0:20:56] <TopTierHarley> lol

[0:21:20] <illtima> Eloquent as always, Pat
[0:21:21] <%DianaTheAscian> I don't care about my locals
[0:21:24] <%MrGuy516> I JUST GOT IN.

[0:21:26] <LethalPlacebo> I never realized how similar you and George Weidman sound sometimes
[0:21:27] <PinoProxie> meow
[0:21:27] <%AkronymCLT> Guilty Gear has the good wifi at lasy
[0:21:28] <Lancaster_H> why the fuck would it not have crossplay on PC though I dont get it
[0:21:28] <%orpleborple> I don’t care.....- Pat 2021
[0:21:29] <jaggstar2020> We can get killed online <3

[0:21:39] <+gantz_zero> fuck locals during covid
[0:21:40] <majindusto> Woolie lost against Kageyama Shien twice
[0:21:41] <SunsetJack> Fair enough.
[0:21:43] <TheImmortal70> Locals are pretty important but not rn
[0:21:45] <%baka_sugoi> LUL LUL LUL
[0:21:48] <%FacetiousAF> WITH KNIVES
[0:21:48] <Zombrocom> Yall, buy the PC version so I have someone to play against

[0:21:50] <%MugenSandan> @patstaresat but Pat MUH CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
[0:21:50] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt Comparing strive rollback vs accent core, strive takes it?
[0:21:50] <+McSoliace> as long as people on pc don't give up like huge cowards it will be fine to get on PC
[0:21:51] <%LeiaSkynoober> Guelph doesn't have locals anyways lol
[0:21:51] <%cervidaequus> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[0:21:53] <%FacetiousAF> and mystery syringes
[0:21:55] <+KaizenShio> plus they said pc crossplay wont be on launch but looking in to it
[0:21:55] <%CapnClassix> Nintendo wants you to die confirmed
[0:21:56] <DaKnightWarrior> That's what Nintendo wants though.
[0:21:57] <huskarl_zap> Commentary on something there?
[0:22:00] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt mine actually did
[0:22:01] <%baka_sugoi> Just dive into the Shark tank
[0:22:01] <TopTierHarley> Cause you are lucky to have rollback, crossplay is another fight
[0:22:03] <%walternatorz> "they kill your ass dead" "hi, elmo"
[0:22:11] <Meltgar> Daaaaaaam
[0:22:15] <old_dog_god> Gotta do H to get mental rollback

[0:22:27] <HamFamJam> mortal kombat?
[0:22:29] <+Annat3l> yeah I don't have a ps4, and every streamer telling everyone to steer clear of pc is FeelsBadMan
[0:22:29] <+McSoliace> its on par with KI
[0:22:30] <+Slushsoup> I want to revive fighting game obsessed Pat
[0:22:30] <scrublord009> Is the open beta out?????
[0:22:35] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt what did you have to do to get your fightstick working on the PS5?
[0:22:35] <TheImmortal70> Its better than skullgirls apparently
[0:22:35] <DrunkenDice> @Zombrocom I'm buying on PC so we're up to at least 2 players on pc so far
[0:22:36] <+SoySocks> it's so relieving that people screaming at Arcsys helped to get this change going
[0:22:36] <%aishman> Alright, you convinced me. I'm totally fucking this game and going full in. Thank god for the free PS5 upgrade for when PS5s are actually available
[0:22:45] <majindusto> I think woolie defeated Aragami Oga of Holostars tho
[0:22:46] <+harry_macdougall> harry_macdougall subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 5 month streak! I'm here for the dog and the cat thats it

[0:23:09] <%SaiyanShoto> My stick works perfectly on my PS5
[0:23:11] <+BusterRepukken> My Hitbox doesnt work on PS5, feels bad
[0:23:12] <%Ranryu692> oh, is the beta console only?
[0:23:13] <SunsetJack> Honestly, I am getting it on PC cause I can't really justify being a PSN+ for online.
[0:23:14] <%Jungos60> Welp, I don't have a PS4 or 5, so I'm still gonna grab Guilty Gear on PC
[0:23:14] <%baka_sugoi> PEEE POOOO
[0:23:14] <+gantz_zero> @deathscythe1287 did you notice covid is happening
[0:23:16] <+KaizenShio> plus I dont have a PS Hitbox
[0:23:18] <majindusto> PEEPO?
[0:23:19] <%Aztec50> My qanba works too

[0:23:26] <MelfinaStarwind> @harry_macdougall Outlaw Star?
[0:23:31] <andre11dr> I lolove how when Woolie finishes his stream he doesn't even bother to raid Pat LUL
[0:23:34] <+evbites> the guilty man
[0:23:35] <metaphase72> I just bought the new qanba pearl and it works great on ps5
[0:23:36] <OkamiDude15> the boopa peepo?
[0:23:44] <+KaizenShio> yeah im not paying for PS+
[0:23:49] <peachy996> Nah I don't like GG
[0:23:51] <+pr_illuminati> I mean imagine being a SFV player right now lmao
[0:23:54] <%orpleborple> delay based: psaWhat rollback: psaSmug
[0:23:55] <peachy996> But have fun
[0:23:56] <+KaizenShio> Pc it is
[0:23:59] <+JustToWatch> apparently I need a 3rd party ps4 controller to get my Mayflash to work on the PS5
[0:24:00] <%deathscythe1287> @gantz_zero it was a joke from the podcast that Pat said
[0:24:01] <%AkronymCLT> Is it gonna be an open beta or is it just for preorders?
[0:24:06] <%Lion_kun> I think it's very inaccessible for newbies
[0:24:06] <+gantz_zero> then suffer like g did @KaizenShio
[0:24:19] <+KaizenShio> whgo is G
[0:24:21] <OkamiDude15> @AkronymCLT starting today its open to everyone
[0:24:28] <%Mrbaconator> and it ISN'T bad
[0:24:31] <MyNameIsRasus> which it isn't
[0:24:33] <+gantz_zero> @KaizenShio look it up
[0:24:38] <%AkronymCLT> sweet
[0:24:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> KOF2002UM?
[0:24:46] <+ladomania> I can play +R tho
[0:24:51] <Animal_Farm4> I can play +R. Skullgirls, Killer Instinct, and Them's Fighting Herds though DansGame
[0:24:54] <%baka_sugoi> ive waited so long for good netcode
[0:24:54] <+Patch_TheSquid> exactly. but it's also really good.
[0:24:55] <dweebenheimer20> its the only game with rollback :)
[0:24:56] <old_dog_god> Please god hear my call for P4AU rereleased with rollback
[0:24:56] <%SaiyanShoto> Unless you enjoy a certain game enough and are willing to put yourself through delay based netcode
[0:24:56] <%kknutson4> Skullgirls?
[0:24:56] <MyNameIsRasus> and that's a HIGH BAR
[0:24:59] <+eanscrale> It's vanilla whaddaya spect
[0:25:00] <+KaizenShio> I cant just type G in my googles and expext a proper response dude
[0:25:00] <leomc2> at worst it isnt like old gg
[0:25:02] <+skylerpilot> anyone else getting "failed to download R-code" now when trying to get back into the Beta?
[0:25:03] <Dablackone> did I miss the video game?
[0:25:03] <+b_aleph> don't forget there's a possibility of another ebola epidemic as well
[0:25:03] <%SomersaultJustice> accent core +R got rollback
[0:25:04] <%Mrbaconator> @ladomania oh hey i just got that you should kick my ass
[0:25:05] <MelfinaStarwind> @harry_macdougall don't ignore meeee
[0:25:07] <%Ranryu692> except for all those smaller fighting games that have rollback lol
[0:25:09] <+KaizenShio> I have no idea what you are talking about
[0:25:09] <+lostcolors> at worst it doesn't have baiken fast enough
[0:25:10] <TopTierHarley> no one wants to actaully play those games with you
[0:25:14] <+eanscrale> But this is the NEW shit
[0:25:15] <%JoshManVGH> Get Into Fighting Games becomes Get Into Guilty Gear Strive
[0:25:16] <%sweetestbeefs> TFH is honestly great
[0:25:17] <OkamiDude15> i can play battle for the grid too
[0:25:18] <+SoySocks> i feel sad that a lot of AC+R fans don't wanna hop up to Strive now that it has good rollback netcode as well
[0:25:21] <andre11dr> It probably won't but still those games are so good that this will at least be great
[0:25:22] <%kknutson4> Also Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid
[0:25:24] <+gantz_zero> @KaizenShio you will if you copy my quote 100%
[0:25:28] <peachy996> but New
[0:25:36] <Daxalog> Speaking of MK did you see that movie trailer?
[0:25:36] <+ladomania> my kliff is ok
[0:25:36] <%SaiyanShoto> But those fighting games aren't new fighting games so you'll be playing wayyy less people
[0:25:42] <oniwahoo> "I wish I enjoyed those games"?
[0:25:45] <+shad8snake> Battle for the grid also dope
[0:25:48] <%ssjklyco> sup guys
[0:25:57] <+KaizenShio> god damnit
[0:25:58] <+b_aleph> super trash
[0:25:58] <+gantz_zero> @KaizenShio Agent G from House of the Dead
[0:26:01] <%orpleborple> @soysocks baiken mains
[0:26:01] <KidKaiser23> I was NOT expecting this
[0:26:04] <%nanaki_ff14> Yeah, but this will be the "mainstream" fighting game to play cuz of Netcode. The others are fun and nice, but don't have the push behind them.
[0:26:06] <Vashido22> YUP
[0:26:09] <%FacetiousAF> KI ON STEAM PLEASE BUY
[0:26:10] <Vashido22> EVERY FUCKING TIME

[0:26:16] <leomc2> i dont wanna play those games i want my game
[0:26:16] <+KaizenShio> yeah i was thinking G was a guilty gear player
[0:26:17] <%DianaTheAscian> its a shame none of those games have a stupid amount of people playing them
[0:26:20] <TopTierHarley> exactly
[0:26:21] <+KaizenShio> I was so lost
[0:26:21] <dweebenheimer20> KOF 2k2 UM!

[0:26:26] <%FacetiousAF> tekken
[0:26:27] <Danmaku2hu> guilty gear accent core has good netcode (i think)
[0:26:27] <scrublord009> Problem is all the games I wanted to play has shit netcode. I don't to play MK11
[0:26:28] <%DianaTheAscian> yup
[0:26:29] <tsund3> but every fighting game is the same patrick

[0:26:32] <majindusto> NO
[0:26:33] <Vashido22> I want the game that I like to have good online
[0:26:35] <Meekest> Is MK's netcode good?
[0:26:39] <+McSoliace> there's something to be said that you should be more open on FG's but i super get it
[0:26:41] <MyNameIsRasus> BUT FUNCTIONS
[0:26:46] <%Ranryu692> right, but you said that Strive is the only fighting game with good netcode, which is false

[0:28:56] <+SoySocks> IT'S THAT EASY?
[0:28:57] <%SaiyanShoto> If tekken can get rollback then Smash probably could because both of those games are developed by Bandai Namco

[0:29:56] <oniwahoo> Change is forced by the dead, Kojima's done it again
[0:29:56] <Meekest> If you don't put in rollback it means you want to kill people
[0:29:59] <OkamiDude15> the price of rollback is steep :(
[0:29:59] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt remember how daisuke literally said "rollback wouldn't work on GG", and it was before the pandemic?
[0:30:00] <+b_aleph> Like saw

[0:30:05] <Sartastic> psaWink smiffMommaKitty
[0:30:09] <leomc2> would locals be a thing if rollback got implemented WAY EARLIER

[0:30:42] <leomc2> funny how +r has it now
[0:30:43] <metaphase72> Smash will literally never had good netcode Nintendo doesn’t care
[0:30:43] <%JoshManVGH> Is MK11 slow enough for delay based?
[0:30:47] <+KaizenShio> Daiskue Never played slippi OneHand
[0:30:47] <Gloppie> Yeah animations kinda have to be built around rollback
[0:30:50] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt never ever forget Harada talking about implamenting AI as opposed to fixing the fucking netcode
[0:30:59] <%Mrbaconator> and i bet it was AND THEY DID IT
[0:31:00] <dante_9x> worth it the hussle
[0:31:00] <+jiggy_snipe> he just needed help from people who knew how
[0:31:01] <+BusterRepukken> Nintendo is still using servers from 2002
[0:31:01] <andre11dr> SF tried it first, but it was shit because " Fuck it ,will do it our own way, we know better"
[0:31:03] <+kiradusk4200> its only impossible when they dont give you the funding lol
[0:31:03] <Evendrag> this is the best netcode for a fighting game yet, thats actuaklly crazy
[0:31:04] <+cubbywolf> and then Indie FGC showed them it works
[0:31:06] <+Gamingand808s> KI is pretty fast too though
[0:31:07] <+ALazo> It's actually the same amount of work regardless of frames. It just looks more scuffed
[0:31:09] <saiyanblitz> Hello

[0:31:33] <jaggstar2020> deep learning shimmies

[0:31:36] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> I'm actually impressed how fast Arcsys put together this new netcode with it being this good
[0:31:37] <FutaSnek> LETS MAKE HAL KICK ASS
[0:31:38] <+kiradusk4200> now we NEED AI players to shit on Human Players
[0:31:39] <Pyrrhus90> Harada wants that Skynet

[0:31:43] <+glassesaregod> Let's be honest. Bamco won't add rollback even WITH another decade of whining and a SECOND pandemic working in tandem with the first.
[0:31:43] <fazoburquina> harada lives IN THE FUTURE
[0:31:45] <%miguelrod777> what if we just played the game for you
[0:31:45] <%CalderGaming> the planet called Japan

[0:31:46] <%baka_sugoi> Harada Badguy LUL
[0:31:48] <peachy996> But has Okubo said anything about it
[0:31:51] <%ssjklyco> no, we'll do more work so we don't have to fix it
[0:31:52] <+ALazo> Tekken is 3!
[0:31:54] <+AXL808> what if we turned a game into a ROBOT
[0:31:54] <leomc2> make a homonculus that plays online
[0:32:01] <+Stormzcales_Lair> vs lv9 sephiroths
[0:32:03] <huskarl_zap> what is a frame?

[0:32:03] <%Dr_DangerPhD> T-800 Combot is easier to make to them than rollback lol
[0:32:04] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt do you think we'll reach a point where Smash is the one big game with shitty online?
[0:32:04] <+cubbywolf> smash AI is good so they can take over when the other player drops
[0:32:07] <Chatterbox1991> The AI shit is equivlent to trying to invent a flamethrower to light a campfire

[0:32:27] <%DianaTheAscian> Its a shame that smash netcode sucks

[0:41:47] <Mysticnamja> Forward + K into pot buster
[0:41:49] <SunsetJack> @manwad Empty cancel a normal to improve the range of a command throw.
[0:41:51] <$floralkami> @eldrago16 it means empty in Japanese. essentially a jab grab cancel without touching the opponent. it extends the normal grab range

[0:50:51] <huskarl_zap> so everyone quitin day one now?
[0:50:53] <+b_aleph> Nago does nothing compared to Potemkin
[0:50:54] <RemedyofRevenge> Where is the source for this?
[0:50:56] <jaggstar2020> It looks sick, I hate it.
[0:50:56] <%dkzk21> "Just blo---oh wait."
[0:50:57] <EnderGamma> burst makes it fair hahaha
[0:50:57] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> atomic100Udodged
[0:50:58] <%SaiyanShoto> I missed fighting game Pat
[0:50:59] <Vashido22> SPARK BOLT
[0:51:00] <+Stunstark> Can you share the link for that
[0:51:00] <%coward_man> oh my god this bullshit is horrifying
[0:51:01] <DaKnightWarrior> GOOD
[0:51:01] <OkamiDude15> @SomersaultJustice they could totally burst that
[0:51:01] <+b_aleph> Iron Tager is fucking sick
[0:51:04] <Garrison27> Yeah more or less
[0:51:09] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 55% combo death wipe
[0:51:10] <+Nomenanza> @emperordread GG's thing where you can pretty much cancel your recovery frames to link combos or to keep yourself safe
[0:51:11] <yorik1> this game moves so slow man
[0:51:13] <Aydarkzero> neat
[0:51:15] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Also guard impact does like 40% rics gauge in one hit
[0:51:16] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> :D
[0:51:16] <Vashido22> yup
[0:51:18] <+b_aleph> Tager is the sickest grappler ever
[0:51:19] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I gotta say man, this is the most excited I've seen YOU for a Fighting Game in a long while
[0:51:22] <%orpleborple> peach saliva tweeting weird shit
[0:51:23] <tsund3> POTEMKIN SSS++ TIER
[0:51:26] <Evendrag> sol throws are basically pot busters too
[0:51:28] <+drjazzmonkay> Justin Wong been doing some crazy stuff as Pot and May
[0:51:28] <huskarl_zap> whole population quitinn
[0:51:28] <%Dr_DangerPhD> No way Arcsys lets a grappler have this much sauce in their games tho, nerf incoming
[0:51:29] <+Fiiib> a fellow glue eater
[0:51:31] <%the22cstomp> i've been enjoying eddie because he's really nasty and mean in this game now
[0:51:34] <+McSoliace> most characters in GG are at least this good
[0:51:34] <+zakaru99> When your risc is high you take more damage
[0:51:34] <BigNerdSam> ***
[0:51:36] <Garrison27> Its not
[0:51:36] <+symphonicsuplex> if you block alot die
[0:51:36] <Kaito_Cam> Still not up
[0:51:39] <jorniev> just pick a top tier
[0:51:39] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> guard break gauge, RISC, my b typo
[0:51:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> pat was on Capcom and now playing Guilty Gear?! yay!
[0:51:41] <fairore> @yorik1 thats slow ?
[0:51:44] <Bluewolf544> risk = damage
[0:51:45] <Magicferret> Risk is stun even if you block iirc
[0:51:45] <mattdaddyd101> thats gross i love it,
[0:51:46] <Garrison27> the servers are fucked
[0:51:46] <Zombrocom> Risc gauge. For guard breaks
[0:51:46] <old_dog_god> Make hit hurt more
[0:51:47] <BluBox> Guard crank
[0:51:49] <%MechArch> psaFist
[0:51:49] <%emperordread> @Nomenanza How do you do the cancel? Is it like a movement or starting a new attack?
[0:51:49] <RoboticRexkek> it's up tonight?
[0:51:50] <+Nomenanza> I don't think one can even download it even
[0:51:51] <+drjazzmonkay> His design is so great
[0:51:52] <%Arancet> more than kanji?
[0:51:52] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> won't it be up in 40 mins?
[0:51:53] <+Rekinsinn> i was under the impression it goes up at 10pm
[0:51:53] <astrophizz> it reduces damage scaling
[0:51:55] <%orpleborple> grr
[0:51:55] <peachy996> I prefer King fromm Tekken
[0:51:55] <DaKnightWarrior> really?!
[0:51:57] <yorik1> yes, yes it is
[0:51:57] <+johnny_gogo> Because hes short right?
[0:51:58] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Landing pot buster feels SO good
[0:51:58] <+BusterRepukken> why didnt you name your dog Potemkin then
[0:51:59] <DrunkenDice> More than King?!?!
[0:51:59] <%SomersaultJustice> cerabella?
[0:51:59] <fazoburquina> Pat: what's your grappler tier list?
[0:51:59] <LoneFonte> you block too much, you may take more damage
[0:52:00] <Evendrag> why isnt your dog named potemkin
[0:52:01] <peachy996> Sexy too
[0:52:02] <%silver_madness> silver_madness subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Love you Pat. I know nothing about Guilty Gear but enjoy the game.
[0:52:03] <@SoFarFetched> @orpleborple so what she normally does? sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[0:52:03] <+abrupt_abe> Didn't you name your dog Zangief?
[0:52:05] <Calek> @PatStaresAt I just tuned in and a little lost is Potemkin your favourite grappler?
[0:52:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> y
[0:52:05] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt Any other character you waiting for Strive?
[0:52:11] <+BreezlesMcCheezles> @PatStaresAt more than Hawk Wolfield
[0:52:11] <%nanaki_ff14> Why not name Zangief to Potenken then?
[0:52:11] <+drjazzmonkay> and he has a cool hat
[0:52:11] <+SoySocks> big heavy is all it takes
[0:52:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he's a chonky boi
[0:52:13] <+b_aleph> How do you know he's the heaviest?
[0:52:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> so you can relate?
[0:52:16] <%SomersaultJustice> what about abigail?
[0:52:16] <Mysticnamja> no air dash
[0:52:17] <+waltzqueen> you can identify with slow and heavy huuh?
[0:52:18] <%baka_sugoi> but he can HURT
[0:52:18] <+Gamingand808s> is abigail bigger?
[0:52:18] <Meltgar> What about Hakkan? Kappa
[0:52:19] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, any plans for a Bravely Default 2 one-off?
[0:52:21] <%Aztec50> him fingers lorge
[0:52:22] <+b_aleph> Tam Tam is prolly heavier than him
[0:52:22] <%MugenSandan> Damn Pat confirmed to not love Zangief LUL
[0:52:22] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt the more you block, the higher the risk gauge goes. If you get hit with risk gauge you take more damage, and if its really high every hit is a counter hit
[0:52:26] <extradopeness> It just means you get hurt worse when they open you up
[0:52:26] <Buttku> no TAGER tho
[0:52:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> Potemkin is Gamagori size
[0:52:28] <+RealPT1> he can double jump though
[0:52:29] <%Master_Van> More than Kanji
[0:52:30] <%kewlmyc> Not Kanji?
[0:52:30] <blkmar> But HUGO
[0:52:31] <SunsetJack> Tager?
[0:52:31] <%nanaki_ff14> True it is a funner name
[0:52:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Abigail is also big
[0:52:32] <BluBox> Abigail is a steamroller
[0:52:33] <DrunkenDice> what about Hakkan atpCap
[0:52:33] <%californaya> Abigail is a walking wall of meat
[0:52:33] <+symphonicsuplex> hey pat are you gonna rt some of that tech
[0:52:33] <DocChutney> @PatStaresAt RISC builds up when the opponent blocks, when you hit an opponent in a combo it drains, each of the combo hits that happen when there is RISC left are totally unscaled
[0:52:33] <deviljhojho_> abigail is unga no?
[0:52:34] <%TheWinged7> Man, potemkin makes me mis playing Atlas in Rising thunder
[0:52:34] <+Nomenanza> @emperordread iirc it is normally like 2 or 3 buttons but normally I just macro it. Properties of RC also change depending on when in the move animaiton you execute it
[0:52:35] <%SvenHolgersson> ABIGAIL IS SHIT THATS WHAT HE IS
[0:52:36] <Dalonomus> Abi and Hugo are brawlers
[0:52:36] <+McSoliace> Alex?
[0:52:37] <bob900000> hugo
[0:52:38] <%OffbeatMinority> hello Mr pat
[0:52:38] <Bluewolf544> As a person that would never touch a grappler Potempkin is so fucking cool
[0:52:40] <huskarl_zap> keepin that gate
[0:52:40] <+traximus_s> he looks the coolest
[0:52:41] <+Mintios> @PatStaresAt How does Tager compare to Potemkin?
[0:52:42] <%cervidaequus> Beeg phat boiz aesthetic
[0:52:43] <%Mrbaconator> WOO
[0:52:44] <JunkyardCrow> With psaBig arms
[0:52:45] <%twoto858> Abigail's more like Juggernaut
[0:52:46] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I gotta say man, this is the most excited I've seen YOU for a Fighting Game in a long while
[0:52:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> GOOD
[0:52:48] <%Mrbaconator> I LOVE guilty gear!
[0:52:49] <%dd44dostivei> potempkin is a movie/ship
[0:52:51] <%Kaask> guilty gear is cool
[0:52:53] <DaKnightWarrior> Cool!
[0:52:53] <%coward_man> I dont understand how to grappler and I'm too afraid to learn how
[0:52:55] <%GingaNZ> DO IT THE NETCODE WORKSSSSSSS
[0:52:56] <%Mendin> Woolie's gonna be thrilled

[0:53:11] <Discount_CJ> yeah...
[0:53:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you DID teach Clemps
[0:53:11] <+Nomenanza> GG is still the franshise I like most
[0:53:13] <%Nested_Dreams> Did netcode being good got confirmed?
[0:53:14] <yorik1> this channel is basically a just chatting channel. I never see gameplay here
[0:53:14] <%SomersaultJustice> parsec dbz is pretty decent
[0:53:15] <%orpleborple> anyone find it weird Potemkin for while was the only dark-skinned character and he was a slave
[0:53:17] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> DBZ is great LUL LUL LUL
[0:53:17] <%silver_madness> psaCrazy
[0:53:18] <+ScottishMadJacko> DBFz is my fav fighting game but i cant stand the online
[0:53:18] <DrkJP520> depressing about dbfz netcode. made me stop
[0:53:20] <Zombrocom> N E T C O D E
[0:53:21] <+ghostfaceninja_> heres hoping for DBZF Xrd
[0:53:23] <%emperordread> @Nomenanza Ok, thank you for the explanation. Been hearing the term for ages but I have nfi who Roman was or how he cancelled so well
[0:53:23] <+johnny_gogo> Yup
[0:53:23] <%OffbeatMinority> Pat stares at Geting into Fighting games

[0:53:30] <+Cactuskris> GranBlue is betetr than GG and DBZ but it is dead
[0:53:30] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[0:53:31] <%Monkeyweed21> oh just you wait until you have to lose the lobby system
[0:53:33] <+Gamingand808s> if rev 2 and uniel had this netcode they would still have a big scene
[0:53:35] <$yeknomlive> I would have still been hard in on sc6 and gbvs
[0:53:36] <+Birdigalore> DBFZ is my favorite Goku game
[0:53:39] <%SaiyanShoto> Maybe DFZ xrd or whatever will have rollback
[0:53:40] <tsund3> no dog only pat
[0:53:42] <+Nomenanza> @Nested_Dreams yeah netcode is great, though lobby system in Strive is GARBAGE
[0:53:43] <Bluewolf544> I would love dbz if it didnt have that absolute dogshit lobby and online
[0:53:44] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:53:45] <fairore> im happy you get to enjoy fighting games again

[0:56:51] <deviljhojho_> GNARLY

[0:57:24] <%BoxNavy> lol
[0:57:24] <%dkzk21> Reminds me of my dad asking me if I was I kidding when I told him they didn't have tortillas at a fancy steak restaurant.
[0:57:25] <Chimeraelite> There's literally a BEAUTIFUL tictok series going on about stuff like that.
[0:57:27] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Accurate
[0:57:27] <+b_aleph> That's true
[0:57:29] <Tuna_Can_0> FeelsBadMan
[0:57:36] <+b_aleph> They have no practical knowledge
[0:57:36] <%sweetestbeefs> accurate
[0:57:44] <%coward_man> I work in construction and fucking god engineers are the worst
[0:57:46] <%Spydurman> Fucking Magic
[0:57:48] <BigNerdSam> Engineers are aliens
[0:57:49] <+Veraverse> LUL
[0:57:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt I thought your dad was a boxer?
[0:57:59] <$StrawberryPantsu> Sounds like being enlisted in the military tbh
[0:57:59] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[0:58:06] <+Deko_> but my engineering degree tho
[0:58:06] <MyNameIsRasus> Sounds accurate
[0:58:08] <%orpleborple> @patstaresat i feel like most people who had worked extremely hard to live like every other human being can never truly treat themselves and that makes me sad
[0:58:16] <old_dog_god> Away degree educated man
[0:58:18] <%coward_man> if it works dont fix it
[0:58:18] <%linSP> just use tape
[0:58:20] <+Birdigalore> The engineers always just wanna build their fucking Rube Goldberg machine
[0:58:21] <Tuna_Can_0> @coward_man yea not the architects, they're innocent Kappa
[0:58:21] <%linSP> lots
[0:58:24] <+Veraverse> BUT ONLINE AI
[0:58:24] <%pokefan9956> oh boy. what'd I walk into
[0:58:26] <Bluewolf544> Well except for medicine @PatStaresAt
[0:58:27] <%sumrand0> 100% get your dad's reaction, I'm a welder with a B.S in Psych I'm essentially the only degree on any jobs so I'm hyper familiar with blue collar family men
[0:58:27] <%slimmixrp> Mechanical engineers something else
[0:58:27] <%CalderGaming> that sounds like engineers PLUS big budget
[0:58:28] <%TheWinged7> unless your wheel needs to work in a vacume
[0:58:28] <studleydoorite> but what if the wheel had another wheel, think of the speed
[0:58:29] <oniwahoo> but fuckin magic is dope
[0:58:31] <Calek> innovation > Invention
[0:58:31] <thelonechris> What if we made the wheel a triangle this time?
[0:58:33] <%UvBenServed> "But I wanna come up with the big impressive idea"
[0:58:33] <socratetris> Most of game development is reinventing the wheel every single time...
[0:58:33] <3Xgilly> I wish we all thought that way
[0:58:33] <%MechArch> patinfluencesat
[0:58:35] <NeonBleu> But the wheel needs LEDs
[0:58:35] <deviljhojho_> JUST 4Head
[0:58:35] <jaggstar2020> Just play Tekken
[0:58:35] <BackflipCharm> Your dad sounds like my grandpa. Love it.
[0:58:38] <mihokspawn> Well just be Nintendo
[0:58:38] <%FacetiousAF> USE THE GOOD TAPE
[0:58:40] <DrunkenDice> tape 4Head
[0:58:40] <+Zeromaru2> But how else are they gonna get famous?
[0:58:41] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Life advice.
[0:58:41] <+ghostfaceninja_> 4Head

[1:14:35] <%BTR_NOODLE> id your dad call his boss to tell him "hey you can stop searching that finger"?
[1:14:36] <heartlesshealer> Yes, he IS COOL. But wow geez

[1:14:53] <+allups> what he talking bout
[1:14:55] <Chatterbox1991> You mean like cutting the Telephone Line while the ladder was leaning on it? @PatStaresAt
[1:14:56] <+CookieCutter007> but the seconds you save
[1:14:56] <%dkthefriend> I did know what to do with my emotional response to that story
[1:14:58] <Jnkolm> The story of how tough your dad is is also a story about how a safety regulation came to be
[1:14:59] <%Arancet> that was my ww2 era grandpa, who at 80yo was alone up a 10ft ladder with a chainsaw and fell
[1:15:00] <Garrison27> Dared to be stupid?
[1:15:04] <ammobasket> The only reason this exists is because it happened
[1:15:07] <+ghostfaceninja_> my dad sanded a finger to the bone cause he some cute girls walked by
[1:15:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's how society made progress
[1:15:08] <%Ipsenscastle> @deathscythe1287 noooo please no more :(
[1:15:11] <%ssjklyco> Your dad sounds like he should have died multiple times. Especially that ladder story you mentioned.

[1:26:31] <%BoxNavy> yeah doit
[1:26:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ah k
[1:26:34] <ExpressNode> Mementos
[1:26:37] <+nicoleymcquack> we 100%ing this bitch
[1:26:41] <ape_hawk> memento was a good movie about not trusting paul giamotti
[1:26:47] <thelonechris> How many different ways are you going to make these people un-alive?
[1:26:50] <%BoxNavy> destroy the evil virus
[1:26:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Lockpick is OP hell
[1:26:57] <DrkJP520> Isn't this the kind of game that rotates content? Do they still do that?
[1:26:58] <+thecosmicfly> God Hitman 2016 has a fuckton of mission stories compared to 2 and 3
[1:27:04] <Danmaku2hu> wait, i thought this was a guilty gear stream
[1:27:07] <Chatterbox1991> WELCOME TO SAP
[1:27:14] <%pokefan9956> am I missing much by not doing the mission stories when playing hitman?
[1:27:17] <+allups> one of my favorite levels
[1:27:20] <@SoFarFetched> @Danmaku2hu open beta's not working right now
[1:27:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @drkjp520 they never did that
[1:27:22] <+gnoame> This is Guilty Gear, they really changed the formula.
[1:27:24] <%sweetestbeefs> @Danmaku2hu guilty gear in 2 hours
[1:27:25] <%GarbageNirvana> He doesn't seem like a trustworthy individual in general tbh
[1:27:27] <%BoxNavy> it will be a guilty gear stream when the beta goes live
[1:27:28] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> can you 100% if you bring a lockpick?
[1:27:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @pokefan9956 yes
[1:27:32] <+BusterRepukken> @thecosmicfly Hitman 2 and 3 have alot, you gotta find them. All of them aren't just handed to you in a menu anymore.
[1:27:36] <%Monkeyweed21> more like WAPienza
[1:27:38] <jackeroff3> hitman 2 and 3 have more mission stories but they're usually hidden ones
[1:27:41] <@SoFarFetched> It's Hitman 2 until Pat can play the Beta.
[1:27:43] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe they put Mr Worldwide in Guilty Gear
[1:27:47] <Severteran> Imagine an arduino in virus form. Basically covid.
[1:27:56] <%BoxNavy> attack jermaSun
[1:28:01] <%RyTYoung> DED
[1:28:06] <%baka_sugoi> suit only run PogChamp
[1:28:08] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> the whole concept of hitman is so absurd
[1:28:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> just like in the asso creedo
[1:28:10] <%BoxNavy> wow that KILLED him
[1:28:11] <BlacSoul> accident
[1:28:11] <+Nomenanza> oh this mission is fun
[1:28:15] <+allups> @SaltkeyAndAckfish yeah i think so, thats the reward for playing so it would make sense
[1:28:15] <+BusterRepukken> suit only run
[1:28:21] <+LordGeneric> The only perfect run is one where there's no one left to be a witness
[1:28:22] <jackeroff3> sapienza is beautiful
[1:28:23] <Severteran> @Nomenanza kolWESCI
[1:28:25] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Every time I play hitman I just wish it was metal gear
[1:28:30] <%juxtest> I hope they take this lobby out of the final game. How are you supposed to find other players when they're hiding?
[1:28:31] <Meekest> Suit Only is fun
[1:28:34] <%sweetestbeefs> suit only run you cowars
[1:28:37] <thelonechris> I forgot that people can die from falling 3 feet in this game
[1:28:37] <ape_hawk> you mean youre not doing suit only runs... yet!
[1:28:40] <BlacSoul> it was a 15 foot fall onto rocks
[1:28:41] <+Nomenanza> Suit only runs were great in Blood money
[1:28:44] <Tuna_Can_0> D:
[1:28:46] <Severteran> Love how ppl on the phone shut out reality itself
[1:28:47] <+allups> the suit only runs arent all that bad actually
[1:28:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Sniper Assassin is REAL fun in this level
[1:28:49] <$ShadowZiggy> Tbf a fall hitting the back of your head would mess you up
[1:28:51] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt was that your assassin voice?
[1:28:59] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Shhhhh
[1:29:01] <Top_Lane_Duelist> wtf i looked away and hitmans already in the uniform????
[1:29:08] <+Nomenanza> Ok, I beat this mission like 5 times and I never knew about that bush
[1:29:09] <Severteran> Plague Doctor pat when?>
[1:29:10] <+Nomenanza> holy shit
[1:29:17] <+BusterRepukken> Agent 47 for Smash.
[1:29:18] <+allups> Pat is a grand assassin
[1:29:20] <%NopeBadguy> Whoa, Strive looks different
[1:29:28] <+nicoleymcquack> do you get anything for doing a suit only run?
[1:29:37] <ape_hawk> @Severteran pat already did plague doctor lol
[1:29:39] <Severteran> this is a whole new generation of gaming.
[1:29:44] <+nicoleymcquack> ah
[1:29:44] <+allups> Agent 47 for All-Stars
[1:29:45] <+Nomenanza> you get hitman bucks
[1:29:48] <thelonechris> Flowers By Irene
[1:29:51] <jackeroff3> its fun to beat suit only runs
[1:29:55] <jackeroff3> though very unrealistic
[1:29:57] <+BusterRepukken> Do enough suit only runs perfectly and you unlock stuff like suits and gadgets.
[1:30:04] <Felto3> you get a suit for doing them all suit only silent assassin
[1:30:04] <+allups> the challenge might have a reward attached to it
[1:30:08] <Severteran> @ape_hawk I need a fucking archive link to that I would pay
[1:30:10] <Daxalog> Agent47 for smash
[1:30:11] <%sweetestbeefs> where he hide the flowers?
[1:30:20] <ape_hawk> hitman doesnt have a ween
[1:30:24] <wujak> thats just kirby
[1:30:25] <+cafefunk> damn, no blowjob
[1:30:26] <%Mr_Pylon> Kirby echo fighter
[1:30:27] <Animal_Farm4> Fiber Wire Mario LUL
[1:30:31] <Zebroneath> He would just have Kirby
[1:30:32] <%BoxNavy> flowers :)
[1:30:32] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Inappropriate
[1:30:32] <%linSP> i mean hitman 3 just got on switch
[1:30:35] <%BinaryFireball> man it seems like every hitman level is the same big ass mansion
[1:30:36] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> wait hitman has no pepis?
[1:30:36] <+zalonar> he's just a weirder version of Kirby
[1:30:37] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> fucking IMAGINE 47 dressing up as the rest of the smash cast
[1:30:37] <%laserbeaming> A Kirby like mechanic where he takes his opponent's clothers
[1:30:41] <Chatterbox1991> Is there a Hitman Game on Nitendo Console?
[1:30:42] <%sumrand0> The Ultimate challenge is "guns blazing" killing anyone who attacks you & never stealth enemies. silly as hell and damn near impossible but entertaining since the combat tries to discourage the player from engaging in multi target firefights
[1:30:43] <ammobasket> Items Only
[1:30:45] <Blank9> kirby is just regular kirby, but with a barcode
[1:30:47] <%DianaTheAscian> I never knew he talked
[1:30:49] <+thackattack00> We got Snake so it wouldnt be that weird
[1:30:49] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Lol, assassinate Mario
[1:30:49] <+nicoleymcquack> hitman is smooth like a Ken doll
[1:30:50] <Chatterbox1991> Silent Assassin on Gamecube?
[1:30:51] <huskarl_zap> Dont touch my 22 Astolfo
[1:30:53] <Severteran> Literally just imagine someone like this waltzing into your 1 million dollar mansion, who even is this bum?
[1:30:55] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> h edoesn't have one im pretty sure
[1:30:55] <%linSP> fiber wire grab like with snake
[1:30:57] <%walternatorz> wouldn't a butler.. just take the flowers?
[1:30:59] <+BusterRepukken> what would 47's Ultimate Smash be
[1:31:01] <jackeroff3> I hope 47 appears as an easter egg in the new James Bond game
[1:31:02] <+lumporr> what if smash brothers hitman could change the P1/P2/etc. above his name temporarily
[1:31:03] <astrophizz> human shaped Kirby with a gun
[1:31:06] <%sumrand0> * difficulty depends on the level
[1:31:07] <+allups> shit agent 47 and Kirby running into each other blew my mind
[1:31:16] <+allups> they both just mean mug at each other
[1:31:18] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:31:19] <%pokefan9956> yknow what. hitman battle royale. you have to assassinate your competition
[1:31:24] <ape_hawk> you lost SA
[1:31:25] <Meekest> RIP
[1:31:27] <%sweetestbeefs> gotta restart
[1:31:29] <Felto3> just don't do SA lol
[1:31:30] <primarch_lupercal> I love how he makes no effort to not be more deadpan
[1:31:30] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Agent 47 doll that sucks your dick and calls you gay
[1:31:32] <+allups> restart?
[1:31:33] <Severteran> so you walk into finding a 90% naked man in a bush
[1:31:34] <%super_ej8> how?
[1:31:35] <%BoxNavy> hoo boy
[1:31:36] <Severteran> what do
[1:31:36] <+lumporr> he'd put the wire around kirby and kirby would just fold
[1:31:36] <%albobomb> oof
[1:31:38] <huskarl_zap> Agent 47 garrotes the rabbids
[1:31:38] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i mean what is kirby gonna get, bald??
[1:31:38] <%baka_sugoi> rip
[1:31:39] <%linSP> if kirby copied 47 he'd just have eyebrows and a cleft chin
[1:31:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Doing Silent Assassin Suit Only in every stage will unlock special suits and breifcases
[1:31:44] <+Fenmore_> This isn't Guilty Gear Strive... 🤔
[1:31:44] <%DianaTheAscian> oh boy
[1:31:45] <%super_ej8> I thought that was a good hiding place
[1:31:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat You only to need to get Silent Assassin once per difficulty per Location to unlock the Achivements/Challenge. It doesn't repeat on the same difficulty so u can be more versatile on replays.
[1:31:46] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh boy here we go atpCap
[1:31:52] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> @Felto3 but mind goblins!
[1:31:54] <ape_hawk> you dont understand, his mind goblins say that he NEEDS to do SA
[1:31:55] <%the22cstomp> kirby would get a suit
[1:31:56] <+lumporr> @linSP and the barcode
[1:31:56] <+BusterRepukken> Agent 47's Final Smash is him disguisng himself as Sakurai and he just deletes your character from the stage.
[1:31:57] <%Livelinne> psaSmug_HB psaSmug_HB psaSmug_HB
[1:31:59] <Felto3> this'd be easier if you used the mansion guard start
[1:32:01] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt you have better luck hiding the flower guy in the closed gallery across from the Volkswaggen out front
[1:32:10] <%chiazam> PERFECT RUN RUINED

[1:52:47] <Felto3> shes in front of a fireplace, you can drop propane in from the attic
[1:52:49] <%pokefan9956> is hitman an amogus ripoff?
[1:52:52] <+thecosmicfly> @chiazam she goes to the fireplace to destroy the dna. You then drop a propane flask down and she goes boom boom
[1:53:06] <%aishman> I think you missed it dude.
[1:53:08] <%AzureGale> It probably already happened
[1:53:11] <%aishman> She went up there and came back
[1:53:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt she burns the dna stuff in the fireplace
[1:53:15] <Felto3> you missed the chance
[1:53:15] <+black_pariah> he has no propane
[1:53:16] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> ...
[1:53:17] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt
[1:53:20] <+allups> this is a very tight window
[1:53:21] <Aydarkzero> this is so weird to watch b/c i'm use to seeing a speedrun of this LUL
[1:53:23] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt wait for the guy to move with his back turned and strike
[1:53:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Too late
[1:53:31] <Felto3> theres propane in the attic
[1:53:32] <+MajorCrasher> around
[1:53:33] <%sweetestbeefs> its in the attic somewhere
[1:53:37] <%AzureGale> Eh, just move on

[1:54:11] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[1:54:14] <+black_pariah> can you electrocute her with that exposed wire?

[1:54:16] <%AncelDeLambert> but what about the propane accessories?
[1:54:20] <%Monkeyweed21> too late she already burned it @PatStaresAt
[1:54:41] <bigben01> It's never too late for Save Scumming!
[1:54:42] <%sweetestbeefs> not for SAVE SCUM MAN

[1:54:54] <%Monkeyweed21> its a tight window
[1:54:54] <+thecosmicfly> Hitscum
[1:54:59] <%MidnightBurst12> time is no concept
[1:55:01] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Yeah I think it's best you try to follow her after you tell her the message to see where she goes. Cause MEMORY is that she goes up to the attic but I might be wrong.
[1:55:04] <%Eaglestrike117> grab the propane and then give her the shit dude
[1:55:06] <%AncelDeLambert> never let ANYONE tell you that save scumming is cheating in Hitman
[1:55:06] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> put body in box
[1:55:11] <%BinaryFireball> you doing a fighting game stream?
[1:55:12] <%AzureGale> Sacrifice time to put more time on the clock
[1:55:13] <%AncelDeLambert> save scumming is the CORRECT method
[1:55:15] <dinnydanny777> savescum it like it's the elder scrolls
[1:55:20] <LordLicoriceDerp> Which power of Agent 47's is stronger: time travel or the ability to fit into literally everyone's clothing and pass completely invisible
[1:55:23] <%justcallmebobplease> If it's Hitman, then Guilty Gear, why is the stream Guilty Gear / Hitman rather than the reverse?

[1:55:26] <%pokefan9956> okay luigi
[1:55:33] <%RetroCop87> I'm sorry, did I just join the stream to see Pat doing the same mission he did for three hours last week?
[1:55:34] <+thecosmicfly> @aishman I think you are. She goes back to that middle room to the fireplace
[1:55:35] <+UltraViolet371> two rewind-heavy streams today, huh?

[1:55:56] <%aishman> @thecosmicfly Aw thanks man
[1:55:58] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> that's hitman babey
[1:56:02] <Aydarkzero> it sure is
[1:56:02] <%AzureGale> Hitman is ALL ABOUT replaying maps
[1:56:04] <$ShadowZiggy> Thankfully the loads are fast
[1:56:06] <%pokefan9956> hitman is literally amogus
[1:56:07] <%sweetestbeefs> look at that guy

[1:56:16] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt did you finish the project triangle tactics demo off stream?
[1:56:19] <%notsoy> you still haven't done all of the variations of this mission yet?
[1:56:20] <%sweetestbeefs> like an asshile
[1:56:22] <%aishman> That's why they're so BIG
[1:56:24] <%AncelDeLambert> someone do a good Boomhuer, I can't do Boomhuer
[1:56:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> @PatStaresAt I assume you heard that they finally did something about the Hitman 3 transfer stuff?
[1:56:34] <Aydarkzero> i saw a speedrunner figure out strats for both hitman games for a month
[1:56:41] <+thecosmicfly> @aishman no worries. This is definitely one of the more odd hitman opportunities
[1:56:45] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> ok just run to the attic and put the propane in place
[1:56:46] <Aydarkzero> it was crazy
[1:56:52] <%chiazam> Go for it!

[2:04:36] <shamefulbowsettefolder> Stinky gun
[2:04:38] <%AzureGale> @drabberfaun535 Not when he's trying for silent assassin
[2:04:43] <JimJamr> If you have a silenced pistol, and shoot only once, people will investigate bullet impacts
[2:05:03] <+BusterRepukken> Targets usually have Super Enforcers with them that see through every disguise.
[2:05:05] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt have you seen the video of the guy collecting all the people in the vineyard level in hitman 3 and pressing them in the grape press?

[2:24:28] <goldenprince603> So did Pat win his Capcom prize fight from earlier?
[2:24:29] <plughead_> how would anyone not have seen that
[2:24:30] <%sweetestbeefs> you can actually shoot the virus and not even have to go in there
[2:24:32] <Aydarkzero> you can only get away with that if it's far
[2:24:36] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> can't you just gain access to the lab?
[2:24:43] <Aydarkzero> it's also inconsistent LUL
[2:24:47] <%Eaglestrike117> you know silenced pistols still make a noise right
[2:24:48] <%chiazam> @bashful_bard does it usually take longer?
[2:24:51] <Chatterbox1991> You were poking your head over a box
[2:24:53] <%Emperor_Machinus> Bullet hitting things make noise?
[2:24:56] <Felto3> is it a kruiger? other silenced pistols aren't as silent

[2:25:57] <%Monkeyweed21> just use the laptop dongle
[2:25:57] <%Eaglestrike117> There was a brick where you took the shot, just throw that
[2:25:59] <bashful_bard> Bc of the servers, the load and save menus take like 10 seconds to load. My game literally loads faster on PS5

[2:29:30] <kiwicoffin> i can hear a second whisper in the background
[2:29:31] <Zebroneath> I can hear it, but it's slight
[2:29:32] <%danpc5> its fine
[2:29:35] <+skylerpilot> I don't think its echoing, I think thats just the voice
[2:29:41] <+sixcubit> oh, a Mirror Face spin-off game??
[2:29:42] <+allups> i heard it a little
[2:29:46] <Djinnazz> this is a long one.
[2:29:50] <+Nero_Cross> I hear it but it's hardly an issue lol
[2:29:51] <10deez> I heard it a lil too
[2:29:57] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Pagie mic on?
[2:30:03] <+BusterRepukken> @Djinnazz you can complete this in like a minute
[2:30:10] <%sweetestbeefs> This mission is one of the hardest, enforcer-wise.
[2:30:10] <%Monkeyweed21> look at this thing that could never happen in real life'
[2:30:11] <skyentombment> Hey Pat, could you scream BORK BORK BORK BORK whne you kill the swedish guy?
[2:30:12] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto sad

[2:30:17] <+allups> if this is the mission I think it is, its a bitch
[2:30:23] <%twoto858> I find it funny that a completely unrelated company only hired you because they had money in the pot
[2:30:25] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:30:29] <%sweetestbeefs> Nice one!
[2:30:34] <%BoxNavy> did you poke your eye out?
[2:30:45] <skyentombment> PAT BLEEDS PROFUSELY
[2:30:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So one time, Mayor McCheese went over to the Prime Minister of French Fries and was all like, "Give us yer oil!"
[2:30:49] <Djinnazz> @BusterRepukken Yeah i know that.
[2:30:53] <KaitlynnHere> Turn game around, it’s upside down @patstaresat
[2:31:04] <+Double_Tap_That> @allups I mean, it's not Colorado

[2:32:21] <+allups> @Double_Tap_That fuck that level too LUL but i was stuck for so long in the indoor section of this level
[2:32:22] <Felto3> this map is huge

[2:32:46] <PirateMike_> Wussup everyone

[2:32:50] <%CapnClassix> Does the haptic feedback work on PC?
[2:32:54] <ape_hawk> hi yuri
[2:32:58] <$ShadowZiggy> Hitman 2 maps are a lot nuttier in terms of layout in comparison
[2:32:59] <%Monkeyweed21> the final level of 2 is prolly my favorite so far
[2:32:59] <%Deft_Thought> That voice...
[2:33:00] <%sweetestbeefs> Colorado is the worst mission in Hitman 1, this one is a close second tho

[3:28:49] <%jaybombdotcom> hey at least it failed at the start of the match
[3:28:49] <Radioactivetaco9> @PatStaresAt if the game says you are playing as sol it will bug out
[3:28:51] <SunsetJack> RC when you make a mistake is a good advice.
[3:28:52] <Mr_Rakjo> Hate this dumb lobby Bs
[3:28:54] <@SSaryn> I was gonna say, he didn't even get that much to do it off of
[3:28:54] <huskarl_zap> The lobby system is made to simulate getting stabbed while playing at locals
[3:28:57] <%Monkeyweed21> oh boy this bug
[3:28:57] <$floralkami> @strangelee Roman Cancel
[3:28:58] <%Nekros4442> you can RC just about any stray hit into a popup

[3:29:12] <Sulliman34> god these lobbies..................
[3:29:13] <+Superbro64> this maplestory lobbies really are a crime against humanity tho

[3:29:36] <Zombrocom> You can RC to make things safe or plus. Hammer fall in and rc it for advantage and shit
[3:29:39] <artoflec> god this lobby what were they fucking thinking
[3:29:41] <%SlowLikeThunder> you can RC his charge move before it hits to try and catch people sleeping with a pot buster
[3:29:41] <%YakumoYomi> Seriously...this lobby sucks. I hope the retail version will at least give the option of a simple list of opponents
[3:29:43] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> I get hyoed for Sky should be high every time a match is about to start, only to get blue-balled

[3:39:07] <%Monkeyweed21> oh no he downloaded
[3:39:12] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Everytime you hit a COUNTER is a decent time to RC into a grab for potemkin methinks, specially since this is scublevel
[3:39:13] <%linSP> oooof
[3:39:13] <+ScatterCatt> Can anyone tell me why I can't find the beta in the PSN?
[3:39:17] <KenOniichan> its a crossup

[3:39:24] <umm_idunno> it was a combo
[3:39:25] <Saltmeisterr> fd?
[3:39:26] <%LaughingCatt> "Guess I'll just die"
[3:39:26] <OldManDeckardCain> can't you throw leo when he crosses up?
[3:39:29] <gunstars20> the crossup dash?
[3:39:29] <BackflipCharm> You block by holding back.
[3:39:30] <%sniffy77> is that a motherfucking polar bear in the backgroudn
[3:39:33] <%Breaknoon> i couldnt find it either
[3:39:36] <KenOniichan> @ScatterCatt you need to use the PSstore app to find the strive beta
[3:39:37] <Sol_Install> block what? leo super?
[3:39:38] <ullyzeez> hold back
[3:39:39] <%Monkeyweed21> GUESS WHITE BOY

[3:39:59] <$floralkami> yeah, you play on stick
[3:40:00] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> METER
[3:40:02] <+ScatterCatt> @gantz_zero That's what I did, but all that shows up is the preorder options.
[3:40:06] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Try looking on the PC PSN Store for the beta if you can't find it
[3:40:11] <+itsgundamu> Heavenly seems super slow
[3:40:12] <$yeknomlive> awww that shoulda hit
[3:40:13] <%DianaTheAscian> can someone help me find beta on psn?

[3:40:49] <+ALazo> Oh shit, that's me
[3:40:49] <SpaceManHotepIV> see what's on the slab time
[3:40:50] <+McSoliace> even if you fucked the range up that was a good callout
[3:40:52] <$floralkami> @patstaresat burst also restores full meter on hit
[3:40:56] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> DON'T LET RAM LEAVE YOUR RANGE
[3:40:57] <scrublord009> Wtf now I need to log in the site?????
[3:41:00] <Sol_Install> oh ram
[3:41:03] <+randymood> When he runs it’s always cross up. Regular hit is just a forward dash
[3:41:07] <%WhereIsWill> pat seems like a super potemkin player

[3:53:49] <+gruff_gridof> DUNL
[3:53:51] <ThrillingTremors> man you keep stealing his soul with those grabs to interrupt his pressure with the dash
[3:53:52] <@SoFarFetched> @DianaTheAscian If you mean for searching the Beta online,it seems just googling "psn guilty gear strive" and clicking the first result gets you the beta in one of the things on the store.
[3:53:53] <+gruff_gridof> DUNK
[3:53:56] <atgithursdays> The real question is will Woolie interrupt Pat to talk about how fat his new pat is
[3:53:58] <leto_ii_muadibadder> niiiceee 😤
[3:54:03] <+itsgundamu> Just do it good
[3:54:05] <%GingaNZ> make sure to hit the 6 then P

[3:54:35] <%Breaknoon> maybe stagger it just a little?
[3:54:38] <$RealThiele> boomer hands
[3:54:38] <+randymood> What if this week woolie talks about ffxiv

[3:54:54] <%Breaknoon> NICE
[3:54:56] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Ayy
[3:54:59] <Garrison27> HCB F is also just way less consistent than a 360
[3:54:59] <eldragon_1> It's just practice
[3:55:02] <+itsgundamu> make sure you are starting forward rolling it all the way back then forward otherwise you will always get 6P instead of Potbuster
[3:55:03] <investorscratchit> Guys its also on in the add ons menu on the preorder page for the game (PS4)
[3:55:09] <leto_ii_muadibadder> GlitchNRG GlitchLit

[3:55:13] <ThrillingTremors> @randymood just woolie raging about FFXIV party finders
[3:55:14] <%juxtest> Good gravy
[3:55:17] <Zombrocom> You're getting 6P so I would assume the error is in the half circle
[3:55:27] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Beautiful!
[3:55:32] <zhenthrim213> im in but this was a fucking nughtmare to download
[3:55:33] <+AngriestAngryArtist> @PatStaresAt if you wanna be super pro, you can extend the range of the potbuster by plinking K~P on the forward motion at the end of it. Kara cancel version :D

[4:06:42] <%DashXero> Besides, I don't think anyone who doesn't regularly play in tourneys is actually supposed to be decent at GG.
[4:06:46] <OkamiDude15> kicked the router but rollback said no
[4:06:47] <+ZephynM> That round ended with the clock on 69. Nice.
[4:06:48] <+Taisuru> @Sp3ctre48 When has death ever stopped anyone in guilty gear

[4:07:05] <$floralkami> "he's learning"
[4:07:07] <%RaziWraith> I only remember Jack O as cute, anime tutorial waifu from the previous game. Ramlethal has legacy
[4:07:07] <+Sp3ctre48> @Taisuru Kliff Keepo
[4:07:10] <%FaderPotater> only the beasts are good at guilty gear, and we're blaming those assholes

[4:07:23] <$floralkami> NICE
[4:07:25] <%wizkid50000> Pat needs RTX Voice lol
[4:07:28] <+bustawof> he if Aria gets in we could get Justice
[4:07:29] <Zombrocom> Jack-O and Justice fused in the last game. Now think about the horrifying character that would make.
[4:07:30] <%Solid_Stro> He’s beginning to believe...
[4:07:33] <+Sp3ctre48> If Aria comes back as not-Justice that would be great
[4:07:36] <stormhawk9891> @patstaresat Have landed a Heavenly Pot Buster yet?

[4:27:44] <iosephe> Looks great
[4:27:44] <Bluewolf544> looks...great
[4:27:46] <+UltraViolet371> they have to beat up spiders to get to the grocery store, you don't want this fight
[4:27:46] <+AlphaRayAllen> The 3D models have never been more obvious
[4:27:47] <%DianaTheAscian> LETS PUSH THOSE LIMITS
[4:27:47] <%bleugh> wtf that looks ok
[4:27:47] <vulkans2> how is this match not looking like crap right now
[4:27:47] <shubachi> for 250ms that looks real smooth

[4:27:56] <%chiazam> This connection sill good?
[4:27:56] <+McSoliace> Roll back frames aren't delay btw
[4:27:57] <$HunterWalker23> Pat playing fighting games gets me so hype, I love it
[4:27:58] <%YakumoYomi> ...and it still looks good. How does it feel, though?
[4:27:58] <chestersan> cmon 'stralia
[4:28:00] <ullyzeez> actually playable?!
[4:28:02] <$yeknomlive> jill valentine
[4:28:04] <Darkred28> MAPLE SYRUP VS TIM TAMS
[4:28:05] <LunarRemix> It looks fine too
[4:28:06] <%AncelDeLambert> less filling
[4:28:08] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> The rollback frames are almost imperceptiable
[4:28:08] <%MrGuy516> about how many frames of input delay did you feel on that
[4:28:10] <%twoto858> I can see the rollback
[4:28:10] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Good job Arcsys
[4:28:11] <+SoySocks> STRAY LETS GO
[4:28:12] <$floralkami> YEEEEEEEEEE
[4:28:15] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Ahh hail daisuke
[4:28:17] <Zombrocom> I can see the slighest rollback
[4:28:18] <+Akizea> YEAH BUDDY
[4:28:19] <Ultimatefool> Who could have predicted this
[4:28:19] <shubachi> only minor teleports
[4:28:21] <leto_ii_muadibadder> DendiFace
[4:28:21] <%AncelDeLambert> TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY NINE MILLISECONDS
[4:28:21] <%twoto858> But otherwise this looks great
[4:28:21] <+bustawof> 240 ms huh
[4:28:22] <%NarcissistCactus> this is the power of ultra rollback
[4:28:22] <DeathByPoke7> sorcery
[4:28:22] <Bluewolf544> STADIA AT RISK
[4:28:26] <MKII> and thats all that matters
[4:28:26] <OkamiDude15> it feels like i fucking told you so - sajam
[4:28:28] <+AlphaRayAllen> I feel like they used to try and split the difference and make it look 2D but this legit looks like they want you to know those are 3D
[4:28:28] <%GingaNZ> IMAGINE if this was xrd tho
[4:28:34] <jellssssss20> Is it about 6-7 frames, like it says up top? lmao
[4:28:34] <%GingaNZ> would be a slideshow
[4:28:41] <$superorangerobin> The speed of light is too slow for Pat
[4:28:41] <+Kataiser> This looks great for a quarter of a second of ping.
[4:28:42] <%AncelDeLambert> holy shit the game works
[4:28:53] <+Akizea> @jellssssss20 that's not delay
[4:28:53] <+itsgundamu> ANOTHER ONE
[4:28:53] <+Parrish_broadnax> Yoink her
[4:28:55] <T_Sasquatch> Anyone know if the beta is out in the EU
[4:28:57] <+Ancopro> but like worst case scenario is still pretty good
[4:28:58] <+Sp3ctre48> I really hope this leads to other Fighting Game devs to start using rollback
[4:28:59] <MackFighters> Rollback frames do not mean delay frames
[4:29:01] <+GrandmasterBFunk> yeah only some minor stutters, that was great
[4:29:03] <%Breaknoon> i'm in GA (us)
[4:29:05] <%AncelDeLambert> legit if I had a ping like this in League it would be unplayable
[4:29:06] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> THE POWER OF ROLLBACK
[4:29:07] <BigLoserJosh> Pat fisted all of Australia
[4:29:09] <OkamiDude15> @jellssssss20 those arent the frames of delay mind you
[4:29:12] <LunarRemix> Now fight a brazilian lol
[4:29:15] <leto_ii_muadibadder> i thought pat meant beating aussies feels great DendiFace dinklebeanFug
[4:29:15] <$floralkami> @jellssssss20 Rollback frames are opposite of Delay frames
[4:29:15] <%Deft_Thought> Now do it on WIRELESS
[4:29:16] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Like, KI performs worse than this
[4:29:17] <+McSoliace> still playable
[4:29:19] <Namillus> Rollback frames is how many frames the game will go back
[4:29:21] <+Parrish_broadnax> right that could have been FAR worse
[4:29:22] <MKII> are fighting games saved
[4:29:23] <+FingaLights> Now... Add wifi
[4:29:23] <Bluewolf544> AUSTRALIA IS ON THE MOON
[4:29:24] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> woolieSPICE
[4:29:25] <+itsgundamu> yea pretty much
[4:29:26] <%slimmixrp> LOL
[4:29:27] <%Monkeyweed21> no the worst case is WiFi Brazil @PatStaresAt
[4:29:28] <%NarcissistCactus> tragic
[4:29:28] <mighty_fine_trousers> this on ps5?
[4:29:29] <KainZero0> truuuuue
[4:29:30] <%YakumoYomi> And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why we've been screaming for rollback netcode
[4:29:31] <$yeknomlive> now fight someone with wireless around your area
[4:29:32] <%Xelhesia> proper rollback feels so good
[4:29:35] <%Arrotal> oh hey, looks like a fighting game will actually be playable online from australia
[4:29:36] <shubachi> are they using ggpo, or did they write their own rollback?
[4:29:37] <$superorangerobin> That's some clean burning netcode I tell ya hwat
[4:29:39] <@commanderclaw> Especially since Australia isn't real
[4:29:39] <+chaumiester> Get shit on SF5
[4:29:40] <%FatmanMessiah> You're damn right it is @PatStaresAt
[4:29:41] <ullyzeez> now fight wifi
[4:29:42] <+GrandmasterBFunk> @PatStaresAt TY for that, i am actually meant to be working lol
[4:29:43] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt keep farming us for Podcast Content Pat.
[4:29:44] <xeros720> the King Crimson of internet netcode
[4:29:44] <Coystick> wifi uganda
[4:29:45] <Zombrocom> Ok but what about aussy wifi though
[4:29:46] <%BoxNavy> any brazillians in chat?
[4:29:49] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt How do you feel about this "lobby" tho?
[4:29:49] <%Solid_Stro> True that good sir c4sageLUL
[4:29:50] <$floralkami> @namillus well, how many frames the game needs to re-predict
[4:29:50] <+munster_zero> if only the lobby was good
[4:29:59] <%goose_attack_almanac> If you lose to Wifi Brazil you have to drink their tap water
[4:30:00] <Bluewolf544> The monkeys paw is the lobby tho
[4:30:01] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Nah, y'all don't know how bad Argentina's internet is
[4:30:02] <%GinAndRoses> let's not go that far
[4:30:06] <%cvp5127> Australians are real ppl now
[4:30:08] <+GrandmasterBFunk> LITERALLY, THIS GAME IS AMAZING FOR AUSTRALIA SOLELY BECAUSE I CAN PLAY IT
[4:30:09] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[4:30:10] <CorruptDropbear> "You cannot enter this lobby because it's full" aaaaa
[4:30:12] <$floralkami> @namillus *to make a re-prediction
[4:30:12] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Brazil is a blessing compared to it
[4:30:13] <%Monkeyweed21> its pretty bad
[4:30:14] <%GingaNZ> its extremely bad by comparison
[4:30:15] <%FatmanMessiah> I mean, lobby isn't the greatest, but i've seen worse
[4:30:19] <leto_ii_muadibadder> we going wifi? dinklebeanFug dinklebeanO7
[4:30:19] <stormhawk9891> R-code
[4:30:19] <%Solid_Stro> It bad doodBait
[4:30:20] <huskarl_zap> until they start shot posting
[4:30:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> MILLIA HIPSSSS
[4:30:23] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt it also looks lame
[4:30:24] <+redyoshi5> it really need a rematch button
[4:30:24] <KaiserMario> Good luck finding a brazillian who own a PS5 right now
[4:30:25] <+Parrish_broadnax> 0
[4:30:25] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> It's lamer than Xrd's, but it's servicable
[4:30:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> Lets go
[4:30:29] <+mechslayer71> Max exaggerating? No waaayyyyy
[4:30:33] <BigNerdSam> Yeah, the "Starting a fight in the lobby" thing is much better in this beta
[4:30:33] <+Ultimate_Edge> The time it takes to get a rematch is awful
[4:30:35] <elicazzz> rf_0
[4:30:41] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> DAMN, DROPPING THE SMACKTALK
[4:30:43] <rameiramaster> It's pretty bad compared to a game like CSGO in wich you can start matchmaking seconds after the game booting up
[4:30:44] <+mechslayer71> @kaisermario beta is on PS4 too.
[4:30:45] <+Dova573> Yay now im ready to fight
[4:30:49] <@SoFarFetched> If people already got a few matches in with Pat,we can try to switch some people out to try and get a chance to play.
[4:30:51] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> This is what confidence looks like
[4:30:54] <+mechslayer71> PS4 and PS5 can play together, right?
[4:30:58] <CorruptDropbear> Simply being able to play with SEA and Oceania with perfect code is big
[4:31:02] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> yes
[4:31:02] <viewtifulr> wow if the connection be this good I may actually get back into fighting games - Im similar to Plague living standards
[4:31:04] <Finakala> I could theoretically fight Pat even from the UK huh
[4:31:04] <+AlphaRayAllen> S O C I E T Y
[4:31:04] <%AncelDeLambert> TURN UP THAT MUSIC
[4:31:07] <+TheBitingIrish> Does Potemkin's armband say the Twtich forbidden word?
[4:31:09] <CorruptDropbear> @mechslayer71 yes, PC is not
[4:31:09] <+SoySocks> @MechArch yes
[4:31:11] <+Sp3ctre48> Early Millia's just do not block at all LUL
[4:31:15] <KaiserMario> @mechslayer71 Does it have crossplay?
[4:31:18] <Finakala> Although I play Millia so, uh, maybe I won't
[4:31:24] <+black_pariah> they said there would be menu queueing like 2 months ago
[4:31:25] <%GingaNZ> yeah air to air counter hit
[4:31:25] <DSD24> @TheBitingIrish Nah it says SMP
[4:31:27] <ullyzeez> Fight a vtuber Pat!
[4:31:28] <+mechslayer71> @kaisermario apparently so
[4:31:34] <professorarcana> @TheBitingIrish The armband says SMP
[4:31:39] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> The legendary potemkin crossup, many thought it impossible to occur, but pat did it
[4:31:41] <KaiserMario> Cool
[4:31:42] <+armormog> it's on counter
[4:31:42] <%AncelDeLambert> god I wish I could hear the music because I can tell it's popping off
[4:31:44] <%GingaNZ> HELL YES PAT
[4:31:44] <+AlphaRayAllen> OK
[4:31:45] <raveous> YEAAAAH
[4:31:47] <Menitta> Ah GGs! @PatStaresAt
[4:31:48] <%the22cstomp> forward dash
[4:31:48] <%BoxNavy> no
[4:31:49] <+mechslayer71> @corruptdropbear because the beta isn’t on pc, or is this the case for full release too?
[4:31:50] <+AlphaRayAllen> Stuff
[4:31:52] <%the22cstomp> or dash in any direction
[4:31:53] <+AlphaRayAllen> It does stuff
[4:31:54] <%transporterthesequel> Spend ALL dat meter
[4:31:54] <+0neReeler> slowtime
[4:31:56] <DrStinkers> its blue
[4:31:58] <%GingaNZ> recovery cancel
[4:31:58] <+shad8snake> RC but blue
[4:31:58] <+ALazo> Just slow someone down/cancel your animation
[4:31:59] <%linSP> its way better
[4:31:59] <%Monkeyweed21> its blue
[4:32:00] <%baka_sugoi> if you do nothing and rc
[4:32:00] <UnfilteredComic> Slows them
[4:32:01] <leto_ii_muadibadder> oohhhh dinklebeanFug
[4:32:02] <raveous> slows down the opponent
[4:32:02] <%SvenHolgersson> slowdown dash
[4:32:02] <huskarl_zap> okyzemay
[4:32:04] <+Ultimate_Edge> You do it without pressing buttons and just lets you slowdown the opponet to react
[4:32:04] <+0neReeler> in neutral
[4:32:05] <%Xelhesia> drift in a direction cardinal
[4:32:06] <+Genericname54321> it's just the slowdown
[4:32:06] <Sol_Install> recovery cancel
[4:32:08] <rameiramaster> It allows you to DRIFT
[4:32:08] <wujak> its just the slowdown
[4:32:09] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt It's a slow down for getting in
[4:32:09] <+AlphaRayAllen> TRUE
[4:32:09] <Retolee> you can change air momentum by dashing with it
[4:32:10] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt It cancels blue romans
[4:32:10] <$floralkami> makes your movement safe by slowing the game down
[4:32:10] <Srthunda> your attack is blue now
[4:32:13] <Bluewolf544> slow down time
[4:32:13] <@SSaryn> Dashes you in and when hit, slows time and the opponent
[4:32:14] <%toomuchsnarfsnarf> In neutral
[4:32:15] <MKII> is that the one that slows your opponent
[4:32:16] <%MrGuy516> yrc
[4:32:19] <%baka_sugoi> its xrd yellows RC
[4:32:20] <chestersan> Blue means stop
[4:32:21] <MackFighters> @PatStaresAt it slows down time when the opponent is in the roman burst
[4:32:22] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt It's a get in and pressure tool.
[4:32:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> Witch time I guess
[4:32:23] <huskarl_zap> lightning state
[4:32:26] <stormhawk9891> @patstaresat It has the longest slowdown
[4:32:27] <+RichardMF_> there is no slowdown on blue rc
[4:32:29] <%Solid_Stro> I prefer Greek Cancels psaBougie
[4:32:31] <+Ultimate_Edge> You have to manually add the dash during the cancel.
[4:32:35] <+AlphaRayAllen> Oh is that the one with the drift?
[4:32:36] <Sol_Install> you can "drift" in
[4:32:37] <+redyoshi5> you can dash in any of the cardinal directions with it
[4:32:40] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> No, you can imput a dash to RC dash, blue is just your onrmal RC
[4:32:42] <+McSoliace> slows down opponent
[4:32:42] <%OnTheDonner> I'd get into Guilty Gear if I understood more than 5 of the 40 mechanics it has
[4:32:44] <MidnightPacif1c> dead angle replacement
[4:32:45] <Bluewolf544> Dash is manual
[4:32:45] <MKII> if you dash before you do it, you float in that cardinal direction
[4:32:45] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt If you do a dash just before the RC it gets momentum.
[4:32:48] <+AlphaRayAllen> You do now
[4:32:48] <OldManDeckardCain> if you dash just before inputting RC you dash when RCing
[4:32:49] <$OranHexthief> octopimp just found out that RC during dust launch resets slam counter if you think you can use that pat
[4:32:51] <%GingaNZ> pot can drift
[4:32:54] <DSD24> Its the King
[4:32:54] <+McSoliace> everyone does during rc
[4:32:56] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> If you Double a direction and RC you RC dash
[4:32:58] <Sol_Install> Can someone just link the "Basic action" video that explains RC changes to pat
[4:32:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> people have set the dash to a macro for easier RC drift
[4:33:02] <Bluewolf544> Drift not dash*
[4:33:07] <Sol_Install> it like necessary to watch tbh
[4:33:13] <Vermillion129> Blue is cancelling while not in combo, you can input dash before RC to move into that direction @patstaresat
[4:33:14] <%FatmanMessiah> First Leo i've seen
[4:33:15] <MKII> using the dash shortcut is useful because you can use it to drift up and down too
[4:33:21] <+RealPT1> It lets you steal turns
[4:33:21] <Zombrocom> YOU DONT HAVE METER
[4:33:22] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Pat's popping taunt's n shit now that's he's winning
[4:33:23] <ullyzeez> Watch the ArcSys video
[4:33:29] <DSD24> Hehehe
[4:33:30] <+Sp3ctre48> LUL

[4:33:49] <Daxalog> Nice of the leo to let you do that to him twice in a row
[4:33:49] <huskarl_zap> S*MP
[4:33:52] <+Sp3ctre48> This poor Leo
[4:33:55] <KaiserMario> LUL You managed to land it three times ina row and got nothing
[4:33:55] <+RichardMF_> oh that looked fucking stupid lamo
[4:33:57] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Fight back leo ;-;
[4:34:00] <ullyzeez> STAHP BULLYING HIM
[4:34:01] <lemon_lover28> ninjajnin isn't playing chip?
[4:34:01] <+AlphaRayAllen> Jesus
[4:34:01] <+SoySocks> CRUNCH
[4:34:02] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Leo's fucking dead
[4:34:04] <+Parrish_broadnax> I blinked and it was over
[4:34:05] <$floralkami> @Blue helps you get in, Red pops the opponent up during a combo, and purple helps you recover faster after an unsafe move. you can RC just about every move and Super, and your dash macro let's you better access the new RC drift mechanic.
[4:34:07] <+ninjaviper1993> I tried
[4:34:08] <+Ancopro> thats big boy damage
[4:34:08] <+skylerpilot> did Pat just do the kara?

[4:34:19] <ClarentMordred> reject modernity return to grab
[4:34:19] <+Rebellious_gate> So much damage!!!
[4:34:22] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Pat "I suck at guilty gear" Boivin
[4:34:26] <GeoffGeofreed> *** @PatStaresAt
[4:34:27] <raveous> you don't really want purple RCs they're bad
[4:34:28] <DrStinkers> do a red and blue at the same time
[4:34:31] <%MrGuy516> whiff your attack
[4:34:31] <%baka_sugoi> if you hit and rc late
[4:34:31] <@commanderclaw> The lobby really needs some rock music
[4:34:32] <syanplague> Woolie is called WoolieVS in the game
[4:34:35] <Bamcrash> Purple is during startup
[4:34:35] <BambooBachelor> purple is for whiffing right?
[4:34:36] <+seaearthandsky> pot does a ridiculous amount of damage in this game
[4:34:37] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt You have done a few purples actually, it's just RCing a whiff
[4:34:37] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I know I've said this before dude but I think this is the most excited I've seen you for a fighting game since like, ever.
[4:34:37] <+McSoliace> late cancel with rc on any attack is Purple rc
[4:34:39] <Top_Lane_Duelist> why is the cancel "roman"
[4:34:39] <DeathByPoke7> purple is on recovery frames
[4:34:41] <%juxtest> You need to have purple in your heart
[4:34:42] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Despite your averageness basic ass Potenkim, you're doing pretty good
[4:34:42] <+redyoshi5> purple is just a RC on wiff to get rid of the lag
[4:34:42] <BackflipCharm> You should check out the videos on the Arcsys youtube
[4:34:43] <ullyzeez> make a move safe
[4:34:44] <+Stunstark> during recovery animation
[4:34:44] <%TheWinged7> yall still in room 58?
[4:34:45] <MackFighters> It's a late cancel
[4:34:46] <+ArmoredDeath> @PatStaresAt blue is nuetral, red is during a attack, purple is stoppoing revocvery from a move
[4:34:50] <stormhawk9891> @patstaresat purple is safety RC for whiffing attacks
[4:34:50] <%MrGuy516> blue is neutral. purple is on whiff. red is on hit.
[4:34:54] <elicazzz> theres a basic actions videos explainig everything!
[4:34:56] <@SoFarFetched> @TheWinged7 yes still Park 58
[4:34:56] <+mechslayer71> What do the different Roman cancels do? About to start the beta up now
[4:35:03] <%TheWinged7> if you want a bad connection test you got an Aussie here
[4:35:05] <Zombrocom> And yellow RC is on block
[4:35:11] <%CatastropheCorvid> Was that Woolie up there wearing Kiryu colours?
[4:35:14] <%TheWinged7> as soon as i can get in the room
[4:35:14] <+AlphaRayAllen> Giovanna got a fatty tho
[4:35:16] <Sol_Install> the "Basic Actions" video would legit clear up all confusions
[4:35:17] <+McSoliace> he has good reads which is saving him 100%
[4:35:17] <@SSaryn> I WANNA GET IN 58 YOU FUCKERS
[4:35:19] <Vashido22> chat I'm stuck at "communicating with server"
[4:35:21] <Vashido22> anyone else?
[4:35:25] <$superorangerobin> GG is like consistently the best looking fightgame every time it comes out. It's damn impressive
[4:35:30] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> You landed a HPB, that's pretty good for Day 1-ish
[4:35:32] <%ClericOfSparda> No one knows how to deal with Potempkin yet
[4:35:38] <$floralkami> I meant to @ you earlier. Blue helps you get in, Red pops the opponent up during a combo, and purple helps you recover faster after an unsafe move. you can RC just about every move and Super, and your dash macro let's you better access the new RC drift mechanic (you can drift yourself in the four cardinal directions.
[4:35:42] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah if people already got their few matches in with pat, so we can let other people get in.
[4:35:44] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> I don't know if Potemkin just bullied Gio or if pat's just too powerful for the new Gio players
[4:35:47] <OkamiDude15> @Vashido22 try closing app and starting it up again
[4:35:53] <UnfilteredComic> YOu got meter
[4:35:55] <+AlphaRayAllen> I want out? Jack-o isn't in this game motherfucker
[4:36:04] <Sulliman34> youre missin your followup to 2HS!
[4:36:04] <%kewlmyc> @Vashido22 Is it timing out to say "can't dowload R-Code" or some shit?
[4:36:23] <+AlphaRayAllen> At least I hope she isn't
[4:36:24] <seaechiowai> Potemkin looks unchanged
[4:36:26] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Did Pat ever play the Closed Beta for Strive?
[4:36:27] <raveous> the tackles LUL
[4:36:32] <@SoFarFetched> Cause Im sure a couple of people in here are waiting for more room to get in.
[4:36:33] <Sulliman34> kara throws are hard
[4:36:33] <+McSoliace> you have to do it fast af
[4:36:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Damn GG's Pat! psaUp psaUp
[4:36:39] <huskarl_zap> Pot hits make a hammer slamming a metal plate sound
[4:36:42] <silverira> @PatStaresAt Are liking the game?
[4:36:43] <%aishman> It's super fast dude
[4:36:43] <UnfilteredComic> gotta piano
[4:36:47] <%FatmanMessiah> @seaechiowai Why change perfection?
[4:36:49] <Sulliman34> i think you need to plink the buster
[4:36:50] <@SoFarFetched> @SaiyanShoto you fought well apatDab
[4:36:56] <+Iamjowens> Yo. That mortal kombat redband trailer tho
[4:36:57] <@SoFarFetched> psaDab
[4:37:04] <+McSoliace> kara requires inputting the motion fast as hell
[4:37:05] <%GingaNZ> lots to get better at before needing to think about kara cancels
[4:37:06] <$floralkami> @amanishouseofnonsense I don't think so. iirc, that was invitational
[4:37:11] <Daxalog> Is the end of match summary on the left accurate? Or is it just placebo?
[4:37:12] <seaechiowai> @fatmanmessiah you got me
[4:37:17] <%BoxNavy> ...
[4:37:18] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> HahaSweat

[4:38:14] <%drabberfaun535> why does potemkin look like a stage 2 digimon
[4:38:14] <@SoFarFetched> You'll definitely have a mix of beginners,people who regularly play fighting games @zombibyte_
[4:38:19] <%ClericOfSparda> She's such a bitch, why a, I so attracted?
[4:38:22] <NocturnalRites> God I love Giovanna's design

[4:38:43] <lemon_lover28> she looks really fun
[4:38:45] <Bluewolf544> @drabberfaun535 Well its ruined now, thanks
[4:38:51] <$floralkami> @zombibyte_ don't worry too much about "beginner-friendly," you'll do fine as long as you know the basic mechanics and remember to have fun from learning.
[4:39:00] <+gravitty_t> does potemkin still have the same jumping D in strive?
[4:39:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, does Potemkin's suit have a six pack sewn into it?
[4:39:13] <T_Sasquatch> It's really interesting how Japanese devs are willing to completely change a characters skin color on alt colors

[4:44:21] <huskarl_zap> @chatterbox1991 on what?
[4:44:35] <tanarath> Pat, is this game making you smile?
[4:44:36] <%OnTheDonner> Would this be a decent entry for someone who thought Xrd was too fast and complicated?
[4:44:37] <Smitteys867> The game is coming to PC but it wont have crossplay with PS4/5
[4:44:38] <T_Sasquatch> If you're looking for the open beta GO TO PSN WEBSITE
[4:44:40] <Smokin_Fish> I saw open beta and got super excited, but then I saw ps5
[4:44:43] <ABakedDemon> I just got here what are you playing this on?

[4:44:56] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> ARE YO
[4:44:59] <+FrenchTact1cs> Oh no
[4:45:01] <$floralkami> Rollback frames are how much time (in frames) the system MAY need to make re-predictions if needed

[4:46:43] <+Irridium> SO THE FUCK DO I
[4:46:43] <%chiazam> Why didn't the Axl use Time-Stop?
[4:46:45] <+AngriestAngryArtist> LOL I just realize I can't play pat because he's on PS5 and I'm on PS4 :P
[4:46:47] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> The lobbies REALLY need a rematch button
[4:46:51] <%SaiyanShoto> A rematch button would be great
[4:46:56] <+Irridium> @chiazam because I am bad
[4:46:56] <plughead_> yeah, it sucks how it kicks you outta the lobby every match
[4:46:58] <+cascadepersona> Does Pat know he can stop his charge move halfway to get a command throw?
[4:47:00] <$RealThiele> yall get in line and maybe they could
[4:47:06] <Smitteys867> Why are you stuck for so long after a match god
[4:47:09] <%DianaTheAscian> fuck its full
[4:47:10] <%chiazam> @Irridium ah

[4:47:41] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> That sky should be high teaser in the loading screen always blueballs me ;-;
[4:47:42] <LunarRemix> I've read that PS4 and PS5 will have crossplay but not PC
[4:47:46] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> NotLikeThis
[4:47:47] <@SSaryn> @baka_sugoi yo sick match
[4:47:48] <leomc2> @cascadepersona maybe in xrd or +r break is far too slow in this one
[4:47:49] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah consoles can play together,just not PC
[4:47:58] <+CashewZero> Oh dang you're about to see the frozen time!
[4:48:00] <@SoFarFetched> so being on PS4/Ps5 should be no problem right now
[4:48:03] <%FatmanMessiah> Man....Axl is just....well he's Axl
[4:48:03] <+cluckme_arse> seriously?
[4:48:04] <+CashewZero> JK

[4:48:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't know Guilty Gear, why so much noise about Axl?
[4:48:28] <plughead_> arcsys said they're looking into cross play
[4:48:36] <%DianaTheAscian> is that the same axl?
[4:48:37] <plughead_> they want to implement it after launch
[4:48:42] <Zombrocom> @commanderclaw Annoying zoner

[4:52:33] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Thanks for the fun stream pat, i had a really rough day because my dumb cat ate some poisonous plants, he's recovering now but it's been super exhausting, this was a nice break from reality, GG dude
[4:52:33] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I keep messing around in training mode and then the servers die before I get into a match LUL
[4:52:34] <@SSaryn> Fantastic.

[4:52:47] <%Wool> Power's dying in Texas and these matches are still great
[4:52:49] <%Monkeyweed21> like 1 bad match against a wifi warrior
[4:52:50] <kehnimentu> 9/10 cou'dnt feel a 200 ms
[4:52:51] <@SSaryn> Fought against @baka_sugoi in a Nago mirror match and it was good
[4:52:51] <David_de_Bergerac> Literally every match was perfect or nearly so
[4:52:51] <@SoFarFetched> kingdom hearts tier
[4:52:51] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[4:52:55] <%BoxNavy> Kingdom Iearts

[4:52:59] <tanarath> Woolie was a red bar warrior, give him shit for it.
[4:52:59] <%sweetestbeefs> Kingdom hearts got online doe?
[4:52:59] <%miguelrod777> kingdom hearts?
[4:53:00] <Meltgar> No Kliff, Justice, Testament or Izuna? 9/10 Kappa

[4:53:05] <%SomersaultJustice> are fighting games saved?
[4:53:08] <%SaiyanShoto> @SoFarFetched I'm willing to lean towards spectacle at least LUL
[4:53:09] <+ninjaviper1993> felt good
[4:53:09] <viewtifulr> would there be a chance you bug plague to test it for you?
[4:53:09] <+captain_thickthighs> so with rollback we can be next to Pat sounds good
[4:53:09] <+Axle13j> didn't manage to get a game against you but have had no issues after hours of play doodGood
[4:53:11] <%linSP> nothing will ever be as good as kingdom hearts tier
[4:53:13] <%RetroCop87> This netcode is lost to DARKNESS
[4:53:13] <OkamiDude15> kingdom hearts tier so its godlike
[4:53:14] <+LastHazzerd> OKAY, now rate the lobby
[4:53:14] <CorruptDropbear> 8/10 doesn't handle Australia perfectly but AUS to SEA is perfect.
[4:53:17] <KaiserMario> Ah yes Kingdom Hearts had great Online Multiplayer
[4:53:20] <Basch71> see my goofy
[4:53:21] <shinji_ifrit> It was fucking great
[4:53:22] <%toomuchsnarfsnarf> Played and it was flawless
[4:53:23] <+zegram250> The netcode felt pretty good
[4:53:26] <%BoxNavy> da peepo :)
[4:53:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> ew pat you play fighting games?
[4:53:27] <$realm_forge> Pat was too tall for the servers
[4:53:27] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt i'm still in training mode somehow
[4:53:28] <David_de_Bergerac> please everyone start yelling about rollback
[4:53:29] <%baka_sugoi> @SSaryn thanks match was fun

[4:53:42] <CorruptDropbear> we sacrificed lobbies for netcode. soul for a soul
[4:53:43] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Can't wait to get it on PC
[4:53:43] <jaggstar2020> How are you chat?
[4:53:44] <@SoFarFetched> @SaiyanShoto Im not too good at fighters myself,but if it was like party games or other I'd probably do okay geefO
[4:53:45] <$RealThiele> orb zoomin
[4:53:47] <KaiserMario> Kingdom Hearts has great rollback netcode for Goofy
[4:53:47] <%SaiyanShoto> Lets talk shit about Pat while he's not looking
[4:53:48] <seaechiowai> ya damn right we will talk
[4:53:50] <%BoxNavy> hes peeing
[4:53:56] <%fritz_dacat> Talk talk talk
[4:54:03] <%slimmixrp> Shit died for JWong too lol
[4:54:05] <@SoFarFetched> Its also been a long while since I played a fighting game. Last one was Vampire savior 2 I believe.
[4:54:05] <$RealThiele> pat wasnt bad
[4:54:06] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Who do you think has sexier characters chat? Strive or Vampire Savior?
[4:54:07] <seaechiowai> pee pee poo poo
[4:54:11] <%BoxNavy> he peed on the floor thats what that noise was
[4:54:12] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> i'll finally be able to actually play with my friends without having to deal with 17 frames of delay
[4:54:14] <$realm_forge> Check out the absolutely destroyed couch
[4:54:17] <Meltgar> @OnTheDonner You thought it was fast?... I would say because some characters do quick combos, but that's about it... Still, GG is a good game, i would recommend
[4:54:19] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Even tho I didn't get into any matches, Strive seems fun
[4:54:20] <%sweetestbeefs> is faust available for the strive beta?
[4:54:21] <+victhebeard> it died for everyone. I just booting it and it died
[4:54:22] <@SoFarFetched> that couch is SAGGING
[4:54:23] <%JoshManVGH> @kaisermario Donalds delay based heals are hot garbage
[4:54:24] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> god bless Rollback
[4:54:25] <Srthunda> Used to play kingdom hearts all the time, but all those axle abusers just wore me down
[4:54:26] <AvailDreams> how does everyone feel about steak sauce
[4:54:29] <%cluckme_arse> anyone know how good accent core's rollback is?
[4:54:31] <%jaybombdotcom> they need to put slayer in this game and itll be amazing
[4:54:31] <%fritz_dacat> Strive
[4:54:32] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> i'm glad we bullied arcsys into making it real
[4:54:37] <@SoFarFetched> You can't stop me geefPoint
[4:54:41] <%ssjklyco> Ot
[4:54:41] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Couch can handle the Thiccness
[4:54:44] <CorruptDropbear> I genuinely might refund my PS5 copy just to get it on PC so I can use any controller/keyboard. that's my only complaint, PS doesn't handle controllers at ALL
[4:54:45] <+chaumiester> Your couch is green
[4:54:46] <$RealThiele> its busted af
[4:54:47] <Meltgar> Pat couch, holder of the Pat Mass
[4:54:47] <%ssjklyco> It's RUSTIC
[4:54:54] <KaiserMario> @JoshManVGH LUL
[4:54:55] <%BoxNavy> what is a kara throw btw?
[4:54:56] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Now we bully arcsys into getting a rematch button in there
[4:55:05] <Sulliman34> yeah same, shit never made sense to me
[4:55:06] <T_Sasquatch> Strong couch
[4:55:16] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Who was Pat maining, chat?
[4:55:17] <Radioactivetaco9> @BoxNavy you do a kick to rapidly move forward and cancel into a throw
[4:55:17] <%Arxel1> do combo
[4:55:21] <+Noktifer> LAB ON STREAM! LET'S GO!
[4:55:23] <fairore> next time
[4:55:26] <%sweetestbeefs> yeah, do combo is the hardest part of fighting games
[4:55:26] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I got a single combo with Sol and that's it so far LUL
[4:55:26] <%the22cstomp> you dont need to combo as pot
[4:55:27] <OkamiDude15> @BlowFireThroatTotem pot
[4:55:28] <%the22cstomp> just grab
[4:55:29] <%OnTheDonner> @Meltgar It felt fast to me, but probly cause Im not used to anime fighters (tho I liked FighterZ), and cause when I'd play online I had no idea what people were doing
[4:55:29] <tanarath> gotta learn the comboless combos.
[4:55:31] <%cluckme_arse> @BlowFireThroatTotem potemkin
[4:55:32] <$realm_forge> That’s not a couch it’s a fart crater made of cushions
[4:55:33] <%baka_sugoi> look up stuff on twitter
[4:55:34] <seaechiowai> well some characters have dogshit kt in sf3 i.e. yang
[4:55:35] <@SSaryn> I mean he literally can't get in.
[4:55:36] <+victhebeard> the game doesn't feel too combo based. feels more RC focused
[4:55:38] <+ScottishMadJacko> Im still labbing right now though?
[4:55:39] <+chaumiester> Back to Hitman?
[4:55:40] <$RealThiele> rip
[4:55:41] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Nice
[4:55:43] <+JJMR322> do combo though
[4:55:44] <%nicoleymcquack> I can't believe you're getting a new door before a new couch, rip paiges bones
[4:55:46] <%SomersaultJustice> do what I do, and learn 1 combo
[4:55:47] <%juxtest> Is Pot even allowed to do combos?
[4:55:48] <%ShawnTK_> I was getting Combo'd hard by a Pot
[4:55:54] <%BoxNavy> i cant :(
[4:55:54] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Your fundamentals are pretty good Pat, with some practice you'll do great, might even kick Woolie's ass a couple of times
[4:55:54] <@SoFarFetched> well I hope everyone who was able to get in and get a few matches in had fun geefFite
[4:55:54] <%MrGuy516> if you wanna learn watch octopimp. he hit celestial rank with potemkin yesterday
[4:55:54] <+captain_thickthighs> just do combo
[4:55:54] <wisconsinjoe> always do combo
[4:55:56] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Comparing Xrd to Strive, how did it feel "Button-pressing" wise? like, the timing for some combos in Xrd was super hard, how about in strive?
[4:55:57] <Meltgar> Pot is BIG DAMAGE
[4:55:57] <%GarbageNirvana> Just pretend he's A16, I'm sure you'll get something
[4:55:58] <%the22cstomp> pot just kills in 2 grabs now
[4:55:59] <%sweetestbeefs> do combo hard :(
[4:56:01] <CorruptDropbear> you combo 4 instead of 10 as pot
[4:56:06] <+ArmoredDeath> 2S then flick 2 hit combo hggLul
[4:56:09] <+eanscrale> Hammer fall canceling is literally part of his basic movement
[4:56:12] <$RealThiele> pot combo
