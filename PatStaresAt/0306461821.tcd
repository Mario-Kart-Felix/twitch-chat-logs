[0:30:00] <+Buytoast> but DMC 2 has that incredible helicopter scene
[0:30:00] <$GohanEgret> most disappointing game of all time
[0:30:02] <8BitDsx> I liked playing as Trish in DMC2.
[0:30:04] <%President_Miyazaki> You can beat DMC2 entirely by just jumping in the air and holding the gun button.
[0:30:07] <CastellanVon> It was never developed as a DMC game from the ground up iirc
[0:30:12] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> i mean

[0:30:21] <%brackboi> why he no play mon hun?
[0:30:26] <$RaikenTB> it still outsold DmC LUL
[0:30:26] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> in the first game you can oneshot a couple enemies with just the pistol lol
[0:30:32] <%happyface699> Oh god
[0:30:35] <zal_silverfang> all i remember is running through a city or a borked city
[0:30:36] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> with headshots
[0:30:44] <Caidezes> The Majin DT is great.
[0:30:46] <$GohanEgret> lucia was bayo before bayo
[0:30:50] <SchroedingersFerret> Thereby creating the perfect character action game
[0:30:51] <8BitDsx> admit trish is cool in that game

[0:47:53] <Amberizing> you need to talk to an NPC
[0:47:55] <%violetheart> It's a special assignment but you have to find enough evidence of him out in the field first.
[0:48:00] <sirrice77> !uptime
[0:48:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 48m 2s.
[0:48:07] <SirBrawler18> I still watch that parody vid of you guys and Yo VG
[0:48:07] <strangelee> pat's dumb
[0:48:08] <element_of_loyalty> 32 is OLD
[0:48:11] <+claudesavegely> read the god damn tutorials

[0:48:11] <DraxTD> HA ... going
[0:48:11] <hntronium> You are
[0:48:12] <%bluetocho13> You need to get him to level 1 first
[0:48:12] <+Shaggnar> So many French Canadians got so upset at that "No where not like that at all!" they all said
[0:48:14] <+NWR_James> If you lived here for a day you'd understand
[0:48:21] <Scrub_Seeker> i unlocked deviljho instantly by capturing him
[0:48:23] <ravencloak13> Eat the pickle
[0:48:26] <+MisterTylerrr> you being old isn't making you crazy, that ship has sailed, Pat
[0:48:28] <hntronium> Time to kill
[0:48:29] <%happyface699> Because you are
[0:48:30] <envy_780> if your on PC then hes not out yet
[0:48:33] <ravencloak13> Use one of it’s tails and cook it.
[0:48:35] <TafferAA> didn't get enough evidence for an investigation
[0:48:38] <strangelee> guess not
[0:48:39] <cizal11> rip
[0:48:41] <element_of_loyalty> Pat is a cougar
[0:48:43] <%violetheart> Deviljho is literally out on PC right now./
[0:48:44] <Calek> the one time being a coward was a bad idea
[0:48:47] <Scrub_Seeker> @envy_780 yeah he is, he came out 2 hours
[0:48:52] <Scrub_Seeker> ago
[0:48:57] <+Ssaik> Not well-versed in monster hunter stuff; is Jho a permanent additon to the game or an event?
[0:48:57] <zal_silverfang> that is Japan guys
[0:49:03] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat don't you have a certificate of insanity from the eldrige society proving your crazy?
[0:49:08] <fattyboy067> permanent addition, also tempered even
[0:49:10] <%violetheart> Permanent addition, @Ssaik
[0:49:10] <envy_780> damn Fuck me then

[0:49:11] <+sindrantz> crazy talk requiem
[0:49:12] <fattyboy067> event*

[0:49:24] <strangelee> wait what
[0:49:32] <zal_silverfang> @DraxTD no. he has one proving he has a stand
[0:49:33] <%violetheart> Deviljho Joestar.
[0:49:34] <+vdalson> handler MASSIVELY improved
[0:49:35] <strangelee> a cert from who?
[0:49:36] <+BlvckDoom> @AngriestPat out of curiosity have you ever played rainbow six
[0:49:36] <+moosemonkey397> the meowscular handler is the best
[0:49:37] <%violetheart> Jho Jo.
[0:49:38] <element_of_loyalty> HANDLER HAS A MASKIMAL
[0:49:38] <%BeatH7> OP mods
[0:49:39] <$mandragoraroot> INSTALL THAT MOD NOW
[0:49:41] <+Skatedeandre> Who said that? Jho came out ages ago on console
[0:49:44] <vingadivo> furry confirmed
[0:49:47] <+claudesavegely> that's why you turn on the gibberish pat
[0:49:47] <Calern> jhojho
[0:49:47] <@thenefftw> Just change it to Guildmarm
[0:49:48] <%happyface699> Paige is tweeting
[0:49:56] <+Prinny_Raider> pat's back on the greatsword again I see
[0:49:58] <VeryTricky> new operation came out
[0:50:04] <DraxTD> @zal_silverfang no I'm sure he got one in the mail bag and was just checking boxes off left and right
[0:50:05] <Dragonfang1337> of course you do LUL
[0:50:06] <Estuko> I want a mod to replace her with tommy's quotes from The Room
[0:50:06] <%BeatH7> OF COURSE HE PLAYS THEM
[0:50:07] <+fFailureatlife> The handler is fine you nerds
[0:50:07] <Nekros4442> I can't figure out why you play those characters
[0:50:09] <+Debuggingfool> !specs
[0:50:12] <element_of_loyalty> @peachsaliva
[0:50:19] <cizal11> why wouldn't he play the best weapon
[0:50:22] <Dovakhin573> So im playing the F of NS demo and I find the lack of You wa shock disturbing
[0:50:24] <DonatelloJose> He plays Buck, and he's here to party
[0:50:27] <Dunric_Mordamir> Great Swords are great
[0:50:28] <VritraReiRei> !uptime
[0:50:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 50m 30s.
[0:50:29] <%skizzuto> Pat just like the big number
[0:50:31] <+Sonik2324> he clearly doesnt know the charge blade is superior
[0:50:33] <Fruitywhompus> great sword is great theres no shame
[0:50:36] <crimsonharvest> ive been playing the FUCK out of DQ11 highly recommended im up to 12 hours
[0:50:36] <%happyface699> Paige’s post is golden
[0:50:36] <haisho> oof I cleared Pickle solo earlier. Oh man I now remember why I ducked him in MHGen. Stupid tiny head hitbox.
[0:50:37] <%vaporousTippler> Can't turn off DQ11 long enough to try the MHW patch. This is the best possible problem.
[0:50:40] <+wunderkindest> I've been 1000% on the Charge Blade train on PC after maining Bow on PS4
[0:50:42] <+McSoliace> Handler acts like she's the shit when she does nothing
[0:50:43] <%MrBorisMakarov> apatBig
[0:50:44] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> He likes big swords and cannot lie
[0:50:59] <SirBrawler18> Swords I always find a blast in MH, I keep switching between Great, Long, and Dual.
[0:51:02] <%happyface699> Good eh
[0:51:14] <%redeq2> I WONDER WHY
[0:51:17] <+moosemonkey397> If i watch the DMC playthorough I would know nothing
[0:51:19] <%violetheart> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, have you been playing any Gen U? I've picked up the gunlance for it for the first time and I'm in love with the stupid gun stick.
[0:51:19] <crimsonharvest> listen I didn't have time for action games on the PS2, look at how many RPGs i had to get through
[0:51:23] <+PenmanLupine> great sword bandwagon better than the daggers bandwagon. dagger players just end up having a personal rave hitting nothing for an entire hunt.
[0:51:24] <strangelee> fun fact, I never played a DMC
[0:51:25] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> I've only played DMC3 and the reboot
[0:51:29] <Graywolf_the_45th> Who's the Devil and why is he crying?
[0:51:33] <DraxTD> "By the way I tricked you into playing a resident evil game with me"
[0:51:43] <+fFailureatlife> dmc1 is a good game
[0:51:44] <%fredan31> i felt that way when i saw Godhand
[0:51:45] <Dunric_Mordamir> @AngriestPat Did you mod in your hairstyle!?
[0:51:47] <+BlvckDoom> @AngriestPat I'm thinking about getting monster hunter because the charge blade looks amazing
[0:51:49] <+SimplyPandaz> Pat so i gotta know, do you go for full sets of armor or pick the best pieces
[0:51:55] <%BeatH7> I've played 1 recently and started 2
[0:52:00] <%happyface699> I’m at the spider boss of one
[0:52:06] <zal_silverfang> i know this goes without saying. but what is your opinions on DmC:Devil May Cry?
[0:52:16] <%DoctorDakka> Jetpack Dragon Valstrax is radical
[0:52:18] <+McSoliace> I've seen all the games but I've played 4
[0:52:23] <yukichocomilk> I hate that I can't change the set appearances, I just wanna look good
[0:52:24] <gubbers> can't find jho? must be up in the trees
[0:52:25] <+Debuggingfool> I wonder if they fixed the testroa frame drops in this patch
[0:52:28] <+xXCrustybunsXx> Im currently playing GenU and its realy nostalgic after World
[0:52:41] <%8BitDsx> there's a transmog mod
[0:52:43] <Nekros4442> Yep, need my white sharpness hammer
[0:52:46] <+McDerpus> they apparently fixed lightning frame drops, but idk about teostra
[0:52:50] <+McDerpus> Gen U is brilliant
[0:52:50] <AncelDeLambert> I gotta Yaku on my ass ruining my Jho hunt
[0:52:52] <+MisterTylerrr> I tried Gen U hard to go back to
[0:52:55] <crimsonharvest> If you don't play like you mean it in endgame stay off my session im sorry i dont have time to waste on carting
[0:53:00] <hntronium> Do it
[0:53:07] <+McDerpus> It's not too hard to go back, just a couple of hours to re-adjust
[0:53:08] <prime_name> Is DMC1 Considered a long game?
[0:53:08] <Amberizing> filling the bar isnt enough
[0:53:09] <SirBrawler18> I haven't played all DMC games (1) but my personal favorite is 4 SE. Lady is super fun.
[0:53:10] <%bluetocho13> No just lvl 1
[0:53:10] <TalisKanju> So Devil May Cry 2 LP is coming out after the LP, right?
[0:53:10] <Amberizing> just kill one
[0:53:12] <+claudesavegely> send an sos and murder him
[0:53:13] <%violetheart> Gen U's really fantastic. I missed the old style of MonHun.
[0:53:15] <+moosemonkey397> GenU is fun, but World is WAY better.
[0:53:19] <Calek> DMC1 is very short
[0:53:21] <%violetheart> It's a lot slower and methodical than World is.
[0:53:21] <sennoh> Nostalgia has a limit, and that limit is plesioth
[0:53:26] <+McDerpus> I disagree, I think GenU is better
[0:53:31] <Serge_12> I Just Believe How RE DMC Is!
[0:53:33] <+McDerpus> both mechanically and content wise
[0:53:46] <+moosemonkey397> I killed plesi yesterday. what a garbage fight
[0:53:49] <%DoctorDakka> I didn't find GenU hard to go back to, I kind of mentally separate new MH from classic mh
[0:53:49] <+Ssaik> Aw man that's rough
[0:53:49] <%violetheart> Yeah I prefer GenU, but I'm aware that might just be nostalgia speaking. It definitely has more (and more interesting) content.
[0:53:50] <MattDemers> Poor Jagras BibleThump
[0:53:51] <+MisterTylerrr> I mostly just couldn't take how PAINFULLY slow everything feels in GenU now
[0:53:52] <triforce_ecksdee> im actually liking genu more than world tbh
[0:53:57] <fattyboy067> @crimsonharvest if you're allergic to carting, just play solo, that's what I do
[0:54:08] <+gunslinger_xxiv> ceraRip
[0:54:11] <+McDerpus> it's just more tactical in GenU
[0:54:12] <TioXyco> Jhoggras
[0:54:13] <crimsonharvest> @fattyboy067 yeah mostly honestly, especially when its time to farm Vaal
[0:54:13] <+oKentucky> Hey pat, my prime sub is up on the 15th and I want you to know that you are getting it. Oh yeah you are :)
[0:54:17] <Dragonfang1337> local pickle suplexes jagras
[0:54:17] <+McDerpus> I miss that in world
[0:54:17] <Serge_12> Like I Reconized Instruments, Sound, Effects Even Fonts Like WTf lol
[0:54:20] <lord_winter_555> hay jho, where you goin' with that jagras in your mouth
[0:54:25] <Amberizing> pat that's not enough
[0:54:27] <yukichocomilk> gg Kappa
[0:54:27] <cizal11> gonna laugh if this still isn't enough
[0:54:33] <+McDerpus> monsters are faster at least
[0:54:35] <prime_name> I wish Odo got a turf war with Jho like the other top food chain monsters did.
[0:54:37] <+moosemonkey397> like, plesioth is a poorly designed, ancient fight with crappy number scaling. a trashfire unlike any other
[0:54:39] <element_of_loyalty> Lord Elmo
[0:54:40] <fattyboy067> I don't like how "straight" jho is compared to the previous games
[0:54:46] <Amberizing> the bar is localized to the hunt
[0:54:51] <cizal11> it seems to be enough
[0:55:05] <applesonthemoon> local dingus is completely wrong, more at 11
[0:55:06] <+oKentucky> admiralKrappaG admiralKrappaG admiralKrappaG
[0:55:11] <haisho> dont need that much. I just filled the bar and sighted Jho, then bailed immediately. Still got the quest
[0:55:12] <SkullKingKota> time for da pickle
[0:55:13] <%bluetocho13> Wait i was right?
[0:55:15] <SirBrawler18> Crazy Talk is getting scary
[0:55:22] <+jihad5365> you need to add more chances for crazy talk pat
[0:55:28] <+Zael913> Pickle so easy tho
[0:55:31] <strangelee> More than Pat being wrong, I love Chat being immediately wrong more
[0:55:34] <leole11> It's because pat said "It's not enough!?" with conviction, which triggered Crazy Talk
[0:55:34] <%8BitDsx> 1/1
[0:55:36] <Kingdom_65> They cant join cause there's a cutscene
[0:55:36] <crimsonharvest> im high as shit, it was on sale at the dispensary
[0:55:37] <cizal11> lmao
[0:55:38] <+VidulaSaix> Jebaited

[1:01:26] <%bluetocho13> Wait did you upgrade you power supply too @angriestpat
[1:01:28] <gubbers> retire from quest
[1:01:28] <strangelee> I think Pat's bad at Monster Hunter
[1:01:29] <cizal11> the quest will fail and you'll be doing this all over
[1:01:29] <%Agami23> how is your HP so big??
[1:01:30] <@Fuggins4U> watching Pat while working out at the gym is oddly motivating

[1:02:43] <deviljhojho94> octopath traveler is very good and very traditional, but that might make it a bit dull for some
[1:02:44] <TalisKanju> @fuggins4u I never said it was a bad game
[1:02:46] <%MisterTylerrr> @Futurecity10 I'm just wondering if it slows down the way Bravely Default did at the 50% mark
[1:02:48] <SirBrawler18> Owners of DQ 11, does it make the PS4 run hot? Need to see if I should wait to get my fan fixed before getting it

[1:04:59] <KawaiiFisto> oh alright
[1:04:59] <mayorrev> it was all for nothing
[1:05:01] <faldin> pickle sweats
[1:05:02] <Fruitywhompus> is he just having a greed issue or just bad at aiming?
[1:05:03] <+capnbeeb> It's bad fightestate
[1:05:05] <hntronium> Whiffmaster Supreme
[1:05:05] <element_of_loyalty> PUberty
[1:05:10] <$mandragoraroot> its good for you
[1:05:10] <TaurusOxford> Pat is working too hard sucking at MHW. LUL
[1:05:10] <thelonechris> Sweat is gross
[1:05:13] <%hawaiianprince8oh8> What does dragonblight do anyway?
[1:05:16] <crimsonharvest> Sweating is a privelege not many animals can do it
[1:05:18] <mostundesired> Shins gone, Pat is sweaty.
[1:05:19] <Caidezes> Sweat's kinky.
[1:05:23] <cizal11> learn the tackle already
[1:05:23] <%violetheart> Reduces elemental defenses.
[1:05:26] <TaurusOxford> @hawaiianprince8oh8 removes your element boosts
[1:05:26] <%bluetocho13> Was the only reason of the knock down to get "i was in a pickle" line
[1:05:28] <element_of_loyalty> Dogs don't sweat
[1:05:28] <hntronium> Whifflord
[1:05:31] <KawaiiFisto> Hey Pat when is Detroit become human 3rd strike???
[1:05:31] <+Bhpicasso1> we;d all die pretty quick
[1:05:32] <prime_name> We would all die
[1:05:33] <kite1haseo> heat stroke for everyone!!!
[1:05:34] <%violetheart> Which means its dragonbreath does even more damage.
[1:05:35] <%violetheart> I think.
[1:05:37] <%Remery_> lewd sweaty
[1:05:39] <%hawaiianprince8oh8> Ahhhh kk thanks
[1:05:41] <deviljhojho94> Whifford, the big red dwarf
[1:05:41] <%violetheart> Also stops you from dealing elemental damage.
[1:05:46] <RichAnvils> sweating allows you to keep homeostatis bruh
[1:05:47] <thelonechris> That's the trade-off
[1:05:51] <rytisone> Air Raid in DMC1 is a usefull skill. Especially against Death Scissors
[1:05:51] <hntronium> Whoff
[1:05:52] <%MisterTylerrr> But then you'd lose something to make fun of Melee players for
[1:05:54] <element_of_loyalty> NO PAT
[1:05:54] <spiegspikel> You know that gamer you like? They’re bad. They’re so bad at video games and they’re a bad person and you’re a bad person for liking them.
[1:06:01] <+tigerfang86> MOUNT THE PICKLE
[1:06:02] <+Debuggingfool> whats are pats specs?
[1:06:02] <deviljhojho94> Whoff, these whiffs have NO HONOR
[1:06:04] <TalisKanju> @kawaiifisto hopefully Paige streams it
[1:06:08] <@thenefftw> Pat, you should just stop trying to hit the monster. You'll miss less attacks that way
[1:06:10] <zal_silverfang> but the ability to sweat is how we as humans got to the top of the meta in all servers
[1:06:10] <element_of_loyalty> we need ELMO
[1:06:11] <%happyface699> HELLO DARKNESS DOWN IN AFRIKA IVE COME TOO BLESS WITH YOU AGAIN
[1:06:13] <KawaiiFisto> alright
[1:06:15] <+JingKaisean> is dis a deviljo?
[1:06:17] <grayjammer> Sweating’s the only thing that separates Man from Beast
[1:06:19] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Actually pat due to diabetic nerve damage i don't sweat and am in constant danger of heat stroke its not great.

[1:09:32] <+McDerpus> EARPLUGS!

[1:09:39] <mostundesired> Earplugs or riot
[1:09:40] <her0_89> And woudlnt you know it, the Jho horn has all three of those songs along with wind negation.
[1:09:43] <Mnightshyamallama> earplugs and wind resist are also really good (wind is more situational)
[1:09:44] <+McDerpus> and stamina use reduction
[1:09:44] <Abyssal_Grave> Big Dick Insect Glaive
[1:09:47] <FairOnFire> Earplugs are a huge help, but you need to sacrifice a lot for them
[1:09:50] <Fruitywhompus> nintendogs 2 for nintendo direct tomorrow
[1:09:51] <%gunslinger_xxiv> And if you're a bow/blades user Stamina

[1:22:36] <Graywolf_the_45th> Why is it in October? What's the connection to spooky shit and October?
[1:22:37] <%violetheart> @Kingdom_65 A month of horror games, both good and shitty.
[1:22:38] <isnotboombox> Holy shit, I never realized how big the pickle is
[1:22:40] <isnotboombox> what the fuck

[1:22:49] <+Yleciot> @kingdom_65 horror game marathon all October
[1:22:52] <TalisKanju> Will this be another time where you inexplicably leave and get replaced by Woolie @angriestpat
[1:22:52] <deviljhojho94> waow
[1:22:53] <+GuelermeDias> pat is trying to hunt monster
[1:22:54] <SirBrawler18> Shitstorm is how I ended up subbing
[1:22:56] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat sorry I meant as wich one should I build but thanks for the other sugestion too
[1:22:58] <%SuperCasualBoom> Time to play some whiffleball!!!
[1:23:00] <+GuelermeDias> monster is big and strong
[1:23:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> I hope the first episode of the shit storm is a Trailer Park Boys game
[1:23:01] <Cthulos> you could use the power of bow GUN
[1:23:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> Cuz Mr Layhee
[1:23:05] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Jho a big boy
[1:23:06] <%Daigrey> Can Woolie tell us when the Shitstorm is happening?
[1:23:10] <+dahaxguy> @AngriestPat An option would be to play Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise when it comes out in October.
[1:23:12] <+Mitalis> so tell me, the shit storm usually consists of "scary/horror" games correct? If you've been covering all these games for a full month for the last 7 years, I have to imagine your selection of games to look at has to be very low at this point.
[1:23:14] <KawaiiFisto> whiff
[1:23:15] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> look at that delicious WHIFF
[1:23:16] <+obscureanimeguy> @AngriestPat Not sure if you played it or not, but Is "Galerians" for PSone Scary?
[1:23:18] <%HannibalBeerus> you cant whiff on a paralyzed thing Pat
[1:23:20] <GoldeNOVA> Don't Je Suis Monte
[1:23:26] <element_of_loyalty> Music Quit
[1:23:26] <KawaiiFisto> some
[1:23:30] <%mostundesired> Music requires you to land a certain amount of hits before it plays Kappa
[1:23:32] <haisho> or don't use the power of bow GUN because the head hitbox is tiny as hell
[1:23:34] <lord_winter_555> overblood full lp
[1:23:34] <KawaiiFisto> music go down
[1:23:39] <+JingKaisean> what's the session id?
[1:23:44] <$i_am_therydon> whens thrill kill?
[1:23:45] <Cthulos> GALERIANS GALERIANS GALERIANS GALERIANS
[1:23:47] <A_d3adly_zambo> music kicks in when get a hit lol
[1:23:49] <+obscureanimeguy> @AngriestPat No Prob
[1:23:49] <Borealum_EX> music only starts when the monster sees you, and jho was blinded
[1:23:51] <TalisKanju> Will Woolie ever stream again?
[1:23:54] <valachi> Hey Pat when are we getting a Chaos Legion LP you coward?

[1:24:26] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> AIR WHIFF
[1:24:26] <%umbypokochan> @AngriestPat when are Paige, Leana, and Mrs. Woolie going to become Super Best Waifus?
[1:24:33] <%SuperCasualBoom> I whiff my sword back and forth, I whiff my sword back and forth.
[1:24:35] <Thalchampz> the best misses
[1:24:35] <haisho> WHIFFMASTER PATRICK
[1:24:37] <Cthulos> @fruitywhompus he is playing vidya
[1:24:38] <+m00nd0g1994> @mrmccrabby tgey just added him today
[1:24:47] <Thalchampz> not today indeed
[1:24:48] <@thenefftw> Great timing
[1:24:49] <+MrMcCrabby> oh cool, thought that was tomorrow
[1:24:50] <cizal11> the earliest tackle in history
[1:24:55] <Fruitywhompus> @Cthulos IS he tho?
[1:24:59] <%Agami23> it will be when you stop using the greatsword
[1:25:00] <+NeutrinoInteraction> Get 'im Booty Steve
[1:25:01] <$i_am_therydon> its not gonna be tomorrow either
[1:25:01] <SirBrawler18> I've noticed certain horror games that you have not played yet and are probably Break Glass LP's
[1:25:02] <+Silentman0> greatest hunter alive
[1:25:03] <%mostundesired> Is this Crazy Talk's Requiem ability?
[1:25:04] <Cthulos> don't waifu their waifus
[1:25:09] <valachi> This is what happens when you don't play as a based Switch Axe bro
[1:25:10] <DeathByPoke7> is this a pacifist run
[1:25:11] <A_d3adly_zambo> whiff it.. whiff it good !
[1:25:11] <Daniel_Is_I> Aw man, you can't exchange a gold ticket for a jho gem.
[1:25:12] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Pat doing a nice interpretive dance around Jho tonight with his sword
[1:25:13] <TaurusOxford> @AngriestPat Give the controller to Woolie so we can see some quality gameplay. LUL
[1:25:19] <deviljhojho94> stay whiff
[1:25:20] <Brutal_Defeat> Why does pat use the gs? I think it’s too slow for him
[1:25:25] <TalisKanju> Experience suggests that getting your SOs together to do something turns out horribly.
[1:25:36] <+creamandsugar> you have to hit to lose sharpness
[1:25:38] <TyrantBelial> And yet you can't greatsword for shit.
[1:25:39] <cizal11> so why ARE YOU SHARPENING
[1:25:42] <Calek> Pat shot once and had to reload
[1:25:43] <+Rshiners> when's the session id bot
[1:25:44] <A_d3adly_zambo> lol
[1:25:46] <%SuperCasualBoom> Since we doing a death count, a whiff count at this point would be in the millions
[1:25:49] <DraxTD> Pat's sharp thing
[1:25:52] <Dunric_Mordamir> Whiffers are needed to make the non-whiffers look cool
[1:25:56] <+dahaxguy> @TalisKanju Maybe for the guys, but for the fans it'd be amazing.
[1:25:56] <SirBrawler18> Which MH did you start with Pat? My 1st was 3U.
[1:25:57] <%MrBorisMakarov> nope
[1:26:01] <%mostundesired> Woulda shoulda coulda
[1:26:02] <%violetheart> Damn, I forgot how low the damage on the greatsword was prior to the patch.
[1:26:02] <cheezbass> is this on pc or ps4?
[1:26:05] <+Rshiners> pc
[1:26:05] <%MaiHusbando9S> i wouldn't have whiffed if i hadn't whiffed so hard
[1:26:06] <%Agami23> PC
[1:26:10] <cheezbass> ty
[1:26:14] <chza> yooo what's up @AngriestPat how's ur day been?
[1:26:16] <valachi> It says PC right in the title
[1:26:17] <arcaderabbit48> Honestly, Great Sword or whichever Pat is using really doesn't seem worth the effort
[1:26:21] <Cthulos> @fruitywhompus you're right, Paige is in the kitchen playing with a wireless controller and mat was just given a broken controller
[1:26:24] <cizal11> you're playing like have permanent rocksteady mantle on, which leads me to ask, why haven't you gotten it yet
[1:26:24] <cheezbass> sorry i cant read
[1:26:27] <+creamandsugar> have you perhaps considered not missing?
[1:26:27] <Cthulos> pat
[1:26:31] <Cthulos> not mat
[1:26:35] <deviljhojho94> stage fright
[1:26:36] <+Sonik2324> is this pickle a limited thing
[1:26:40] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> The Great Whiffer
[1:26:41] <+Sonik2324> ?
[1:26:41] <Dunric_Mordamir> proof needed
[1:26:46] <%umbypokochan> every time pat says "i tell you what" i think of Hank Hill and it's becoming a problem
[1:26:47] <+CaptainJax> have you considered doing damage while not taking damage?
[1:26:49] <deviljhojho94> nah you ruined it man LUL
[1:26:51] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[1:26:55] <yukichocomilk> FeelsGoodMan
[1:26:55] <chza> Have u considered the long hidden art of "Giting Gud?"
[1:26:56] <$StarlitStunner> bukD
[1:27:06] <gslayer14> what an inspiration for us all
[1:27:07] <Mr_Strut> no
[1:27:08] <@thenefftw> This is just hilarious
[1:27:08] <$mandragoraroot> no
[1:27:08] <leole11> Ohhh, you're supposed to hit it?
[1:27:09] <Dunric_Mordamir> no
[1:27:10] <CurrySauseBandit> @arcaderabbit48 It's worth it. Just don't be to aggressive and get tumbled around everywhere LUL
[1:27:11] <TalisKanju> @umbypokochan people actually say that
[1:27:14] <Iam_Dead> pat does his best
[1:27:14] <deviljhojho94> there was an atempt
[1:27:14] <%mostundesired> You whiffed on convincing me.
[1:27:16] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> nope
[1:27:24] <deviljhojho94> he whiffed that sentence too LUL
[1:27:28] <%SuperCasualBoom> Crazy talk activates +200 Whiffing
[1:27:29] <+moosemonkey397> that side swing does garbage damage
[1:27:30] <kite1haseo> pat loves to be carried LUL
[1:27:30] <demonhunter790> @angriestpat do you think I could speed run all past podcasts ?
[1:27:32] <CopperTucker> I fucking love creature design in this game
[1:27:36] <TaurusOxford> Get a faster weapon Pat.
[1:27:36] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[1:27:37] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> He misses so he has longer content in his vod
[1:27:37] <+bloomingzonda> Pat are you excited for the monster gunter movie
[1:27:38] <cizal11> lmao
[1:27:41] <deviljhojho94> LUL
[1:27:45] <%umbypokochan> @TalisKanju yeah but i don't think Pat's been saying it for very long and I only know it from KOTH
[1:27:46] <CurrySauseBandit> overly aggressive*
[1:27:49] <valachi> @CopperTucker It's pretty shitty compared to old monsters tho
[1:27:49] <%kysath> He leaves out of embarrassment of your whiffs
[1:28:00] <aeonicvector> Timecube only Any%
[1:28:02] <cizal11> tired boi
[1:28:03] <A_d3adly_zambo> use that big thing to cause damage pat
[1:28:03] <AncelDeLambert> I certainly do
[1:28:07] <$StarlitStunner> SHARP bukPog
[1:28:14] <Daniel_Is_I> Honestly I just started bringing most of my gear to every hunt. Traps, tranqs, barrel bombs, flash/sonic/dung pods, etc.
[1:28:20] <AncelDeLambert> "Fuck your feet!" sayeth the Pat
[1:28:31] <TalisKanju> Makes sense
[1:28:32] <Daxalog> I thought this game series had cool Insects and Crabs? Why is it all just forward charging dinos?
[1:28:35] <Borealum_EX> je suis monté
[1:28:38] <Fruitywhompus> You did it !
[1:28:40] <deviljhojho94> je suis monte
[1:28:42] <+dahaxguy> that's the dumbest mount i've seen in a bit
[1:28:43] <$RaikenTB> 1 1 1 1 1
[1:28:45] <cizal11> tactical timing to prevent him from grabbing jagras clearly
[1:28:46] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Skill (?)
[1:28:47] <arcaderabbit48> Let me rephrase, using Great Sword looks depressing as hell. You charge and charge and combo and charge, and then the monster takes two steps and you whiff.
[1:28:47] <demonhunter790> How many podcast broadcasts are there in total?
[1:28:47] <%kysath> Get up on the pickle's back!
[1:28:50] <%bluetocho13> Sure its rins fault
[1:28:51] <%umbypokochan> aww stretchy keeteeee
[1:28:52] <gslayer14> try whiffing on purpose, maybe the pickle will walk into it out of pity
[1:28:54] <%Piemen99> PAT DID THE THING GET A CAMERA oh wait
[1:28:55] <haisho> @Daxalog They had trouble rigging skeleton for em in World. Hence no Carapaceons
[1:28:57] <mayorrev> how much for elmo cam
[1:28:59] <%TaifuDragon> Anyone got session ID
[1:29:02] <Daxalog> Aww
[1:29:02] <valachi> @Daxalog Because PS4 babbys can't handle hard gameplay and cool monsters
[1:29:04] <+BoboDaHobo> Using the timecube you can experience 4 days at once, this is integral to the speedrun.
[1:29:04] <%violetheart> @Daxalog Because World's monster roster is pretty bland and limited. Making assets is hard I guess.
[1:29:17] <A_d3adly_zambo> get in there jargas
[1:29:23] <%MrBorisMakarov> YEYEYE
[1:29:26] <deviljhojho94> THE FAT ONE IN HIS MOUTH

[1:29:33] <SirBrawler18> Just want to give a random shoutout to ProJared who's MH introduction videos helped me past that entrance barrier
[1:29:37] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Jagras the living weapon appears
[1:29:45] <Daniel_Is_I> Today I learned he can do this to the kulu ya ku as well
[1:29:46] <+Lord_Rockman> don't call him fat that's rude
[1:29:50] <+obscureanimeguy> @AngriestPat Jaegress needs friends
[1:29:52] <%Remery_> Jagras is a masochist :(
[1:29:52] <%mostundesired> Jho didn't whiff hitting you with that Jagras
[1:29:53] <%TaifuDragon> God damnit I should've grabbed the ID earlier
[1:29:57] <+Comrade_Vladof> This is the most dangerous a Jagras has ever been
[1:29:58] <$StarlitStunner> MOUTH bukDC
[1:30:05] <cizal11> at least someone there knows to counter his counter
[1:30:10] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> the fuck was that

[1:31:46] <Dunric_Mordamir> Kulu Jagras and Jho damn
[1:31:50] <Kyndey_B> Can Jho do this with almost all monsters?
[1:31:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> Least it isn't the Rift Kulu
[1:31:50] <+SirRoyco> @daxalog A reason why the roster is so limited currently is that this is the first MH game of this style. The older games reused assets and build upon years and years of monsters. This game's just the start of this generation
[1:31:52] <+obscureanimeguy> Kulu Let the confidence et to his head
[1:31:53] <IncredibleMeh> Save the baby!
[1:31:55] <haisho> NO KULU YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR CRYSTAL YET

[1:32:22] <jacknerik> What time is the direct tomorrow?
[1:32:27] <valachi> @SuperCasualBoom Kulu is objectively better than JarJar
[1:32:29] <A_d3adly_zambo> pat practice on kulu with weapon
[1:32:32] <%MisterCrimson> @SirBrawler18 both are permanent in their respective games
[1:32:32] <strangelee> sounds like quiter talk
[1:32:33] <deviljhojho94> perhaps
[1:32:35] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> @violetheart the double fly-by looked weird from that angle
[1:32:38] <+Rshiners> @SirBrawler18 behemoth is permanent
[1:32:40] <%jK00215> goddamn evil pickle
[1:32:47] <+Valison> It's about goku being in smash

[1:32:49] <AncelDeLambert> more smash?
[1:32:53] <Daniel_Is_I> You think the GS is bad? My DBs can't even hit his goddamn arms. I have to cut up his ankles.
[1:32:54] <%skizzuto> upcoming switch and 3ds games i think
[1:32:56] <%XzileGaming> whiffers all day
[1:32:58] <Jaller101514> @3pm
[1:32:59] <aeonicvector> but not EXPLICITLY smash
[1:33:01] <A_d3adly_zambo> banjo confirm for smash
[1:33:02] <Fruitywhompus> They said it'd be like 35 minutes long
[1:33:02] <%Jjrossman> Banjo 4 smush
[1:33:02] <+Rshiners> the only thing that's an event is extreme but that'll be on rotation
[1:33:03] <%violetheart> @AngriestPat We're not sure what the Direct's about yet, but they've said "upcoming 3DS and Switch games".
[1:33:03] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 Hey Pat, gonna play some forsaken while you stream this, qq, what's your opinion of spider girls? Also, have you looked into TTS yet?
[1:33:04] <+dahaxguy> @jacknerik I think 6 PM EST.
[1:33:09] <SirBrawler18> I think 6pm Eastern time
[1:33:10] <hntronium> Whifflords confirmed for DS
[1:33:15] <sennoh> Hopefully they'll announce that the online service is cancelled, but that would never happen
[1:33:16] <%SuperCasualBoom> Nintendo direct is gonna show you how NOT to whiff in MH.
[1:33:18] <%MisterCrimson> Terry Bogard announcement for Smash
[1:33:21] <+bloomingzonda> There was a datamine that showed emulators on their servers

[1:33:45] <%XzileGaming> pat's favorite sport is whiffle ball
[1:33:45] <cizal11> happens every time
[1:33:53] <leole11> Hey pat, I don't know anything about this game. Are you supposed to hit the dinosaur or not?
[1:33:55] <Fruitywhompus> SNK Heroines is a very horny game
[1:33:59] <demonhunter790> @angriestpat if I listened to all podcast how long would it take for me to catch up from episode 1, excluding any time cube shenanigans
[1:34:00] <%XzileGaming> savage?

[1:42:58] <CatmanIX> @keksisblyat he's using a playstation button graphic mod at the very least
[1:43:00] <%Gogogolem> Bury it beneath a large dog.
[1:43:01] <$konekoryugamine> RED FLAG
[1:43:04] <%umbypokochan> hyperclitoris acid
[1:43:05] <%Divryne> Melts things like a charm.
[1:43:05] <SulfurousAcid> they are different acids
[1:43:06] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> burrying is cheaper?
[1:43:09] <jeecay> just skip town. disposing of bodies is more evil that murdering
[1:43:09] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> us Lye
[1:43:14] <%LocoCrazy_> Shit!
[1:43:16] <+moosemonkey397> hydroflouric acid is MUCH stronger
[1:43:17] <deviljhojho94> just mix them
[1:43:18] <aeonicvector> give the money to pat instead of getting either
[1:43:19] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> *use
[1:43:19] <@thenefftw> But then how do you get rid of the body, Pat
[1:43:19] <%MaiHusbando9S> hydrofluoric acid is super real and its REAL SHIT
[1:43:20] <deviljhojho94> see what happens
[1:43:20] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat know the murders
[1:43:22] <spiegspikel> Make yourself into a dude smoothie.
[1:43:25] <+Quarkee> no theyre different
[1:43:26] <+Reaverund> Flourine is another halide that can form an acid jsut like Chlorine
[1:43:35] <%skizzuto> hydrofluoric acid is caustic AS FUCK
[1:43:36] <deviljhojho94> MIX THEM UP Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap MIX THE ACIDS
[1:43:38] <+Reaverund> halogen*
[1:43:41] <$konekoryugamine> Ypu teady for another shitstorm
[1:43:43] <SchroedingersFerret> Hydroflouric acid is much too dangerous
[1:43:53] <count_bob> You know.
[1:43:58] <+keksisblyat> @catmanix thanks didn’t notice. I wanna use the transmog mod but I’m worried I’ll get banned later on
[1:44:00] <count_bob> I think Pat might have modded this game.
[1:44:01] <%MisterCrimson> dig the hole, dump the body in, fill it with HFL and then bury it
[1:44:01] <$konekoryugamine> HO CATASTROPHY!
[1:44:02] <+NWR_James> are there anti-nude modes that put MORE clothes on?
[1:44:04] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> that scream was a catastrophe dude
[1:44:05] <@thenefftw> Just do Tobi and the Pickle
[1:44:12] <element_of_loyalty> Terriblessed
[1:44:13] <%LocoCrazy_> So I should use the acid, what's what I'm getting from stream chat.
[1:44:19] <+KabaBoBaba> Has Pat mentioned in a previous stream whether he would be interested in streaming a Legacy of Kain game or not?
[1:44:21] <+joylent_blue> poor Tobi FeelsBadMan
[1:44:22] <SulfurousAcid> Tobi's cute tho
[1:44:29] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat might have to delete some shit investigations to get better jho ones
[1:44:31] <$konekoryugamine> Who's Tpby and why dpes he need a pickle?
[1:44:37] <@thenefftw> @LocoCrazy_ Just do what Pat does and turn it into a decorative skeleton

[1:45:31] <Borealum_EX> hm...
[1:45:32] <+KabaBoBaba> I always sweat a lot when I stream, I think it's nerves
[1:45:34] <element_of_loyalty> Cum?
[1:45:35] <+superkeaton> Kreygasm
[1:45:35] <jeecay> muppets don't sweat @AngriestPat you must have spilled something
[1:45:35] <%Remery_> go on..
[1:45:36] <deviljhojho94> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[1:45:36] <count_bob> Pickles make pat wet.
[1:45:37] <+NWR_James> It's a party in my piss and everyone's invited!
[1:45:37] <$konekoryugamine> I'm surprised this game hasn't crashed yet
[1:45:38] <%Ayotocorp> >wants investigations >didn't even look at the investigations
[1:45:40] <theucgamer1> not even 1% piss?
[1:45:42] <chza> @AngriestPat are you sure its not piss???
[1:45:43] <+velemi> P I S S
[1:45:46] <Rellim80> We can see it
[1:45:48] <%ECRead> NONE? Doubt.
[1:45:50] <@thenefftw> How
[1:45:52] <grayjammer> Sweat is basically just you're pores pissing all over youself
[1:45:53] <%Remery_> Pat is very moist today
[1:45:55] <@thenefftw> How did you miss him
[1:45:56] <+NWR_James> X DOUBT
[1:46:01] <%MisterTylerrr> He ran RIGHT past it
[1:46:02] <%korth367> holy shit
[1:46:05] <element_of_loyalty> Pats lactating
[1:46:08] <%kysath> It's concerning when you need to explain it's not piss
[1:46:10] <%Nedlin> How can you be so sure?
[1:46:10] <%jK00215> apatBig platyPI platyPI
[1:46:11] <isnotboombox> did he just run by deviljho
[1:46:12] <%swygpop> like a cricket
[1:46:13] <SulfurousAcid> maybe the piss from your joins is leaking out your pores
[1:46:15] <%brackboi> omfg
[1:46:16] <AlasterAngelo> would it though?
[1:46:16] <+joylent_blue> no guys its fine shut up
[1:46:17] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> how can you be sure it's not piss? you haven't checked your pants all this time
[1:46:17] <%skizzuto> well urea is a major component of sweat...
[1:46:19] <TalisKanju> Piss or not it will still make you smell bad @angriestpat
[1:46:22] <CatmanIX> @keksisblyat it looks like that mod is just swapping local textures so it should be fine, but i don't even play so don't take my word for it
[1:46:23] <$RaikenTB> perspiration contains urine.
[1:46:23] <jeecay> i think theres an episode of house where someone pisses through their pores
[1:46:23] <%brackboi> TURN LEFT
[1:46:23] <theucgamer1> pissing through you pores? sounds like a serious medical condition
[1:46:24] <$konekoryugamine> Oh incoming
[1:46:26] <%MisterTylerrr> apatFist apatFist apatFist apatFist apatFist
[1:46:30] <cizal11> apparently liam made woolie miss sidequests in route b just like he did in route a when are you jumping in the lp to save it
[1:46:32] <%ECRead> i mean... you DO excrete urea through your pores...
[1:46:37] <%MisterTylerrr> I'm actually getting angry that just happened
[1:46:38] <+velemi> I believe from a chemical composition, sweat is very similar to piss
[1:46:44] <@thenefftw> You walked right past him when you entered the area
[1:46:45] <SulfurousAcid> Gout is basically piss crystals in your joints
[1:46:45] <arcaderabbit48> LESBIANS

[1:47:41] <arcaderabbit48> @Agami23 Cartoon Network has a lot of issues, but we now have two canon lesbian couples on different shows!
[1:47:44] <jeecay> pat's avatar has the joeseph joestar run

[1:53:23] <talisign> Aegis? Really? What's it like to have such shit taste?
[1:53:28] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 yeah man, that was the most recent one, i had the fortune to watch it live on twitch. Everyone lost their mind and was super confused by the alfa legion stuff at the end. As my only source of warhammer, I've learned from osmosis and inferince, but there are some jokes you only get a second time through or with prior knowledge. Pps, since paige is a canadian citizen now, fill her mustard bottles with syrup.
[1:53:30] <+superkeaton> Haro is a respectable lady
[1:53:32] <%violetheart> You mean perfect taste?
[1:53:33] <$konekoryugamine> I'M PICKLE RIIIIIIIIIICK!
[1:53:35] <aeonicvector> CAUSE best waifu is Skellmo
[1:53:35] <%Remery_> stay for the waifu wars
[1:53:38] <%violetheart> Also we can do both. We'll fight over monster waifus.
[1:53:42] <Mr_Strut> Because their opinions are wrong and they need to know.
[1:53:45] <Maki_risu> @superkeaton Factual TakeNRG
[1:53:46] <Tucker0603> Bazel and Jho are both best girls
[1:53:46] <yukichocomilk> the one reborn is the best waifu
[1:53:47] <%kysath> Hopefully my girl Haru gets more screen time in the eventual P5 re-release.
[1:53:50] <+d00msdaydan> well at least you killed the fuck out of that vespoid
[1:53:52] <+joylent_blue> LUL
[1:53:54] <%Agami23> johanna is just a rip off of naoto's persona in the novel
[1:53:58] <aeonicvector> also @Mr_Strut knows truth
[1:53:59] <prismaticsnake> why are you still using antidote instead of herbal medicine, it's so much faster
[1:53:59] <element_of_loyalty> EXTREME WHIFF
[1:54:00] <%skizzuto> Sojiro is best P5 waifu

[1:54:12] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Gameplay tip: You cause damage by hitting the monster

[1:54:59] <arcaderabbit48> @TalisKanju And unlike Naoto, she had almost no build up. Its sad, but true.
[1:55:03] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> THAT was a good hit there

[2:01:13] <$konekoryugamine> THANK YOU
[2:01:19] <+joylent_blue> giving medicine to your pet is much easier with a dog, just stick it in peanut butter
[2:01:19] <+LNutt> the baby needs his medicine
[2:01:20] <jeecay> Skelmo could have ran stream while y ou were away pat. why do you have no faith in skeletons?

[2:01:25] <%SuperCasualBoom> @arcaderabbit48 I been here a long time. I was the dude who send an email to their podcast and expose Woolie hating eggs
[2:01:26] <%Kurvera> for HR
[2:01:26] <demonhunter790> *muffled cat and pat scream*
[2:01:27] <$SirTerribleh> My parents also live like people did 30 years ago
[2:01:32] <CrimsonSkeletons> When will Pat and Paige get married?
[2:01:39] <%mostundesired> Y E T
[2:01:46] <+joylent_blue> when we yell at pat loud enough
[2:01:46] <%nitronLVIII> *high pitched screeching* Wow, Pat sure is upset
[2:01:46] <element_of_loyalty> They have to be prego to get married
[2:01:53] <%MisterCrimson> I enjoy tofu when it's fried in the juices of dead animals
[2:01:56] <puhff> Key to tofu is big M A R I N A D E
[2:02:02] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> "STOP SPITTING OUT THE MEDICINE ELMO!"
[2:02:06] <$konekoryugamine> I can vouch, giving pets medicine is a nightmare. My dog can eat around the medicine so i have to force the pills in her mouth.
[2:02:11] <arcaderabbit48> @SuperCasualBoom Im pretty sure some of Paige's mustard shenanigans are documented on youtube. You should check there, if you're ready to slip down that mustard covered slope.
[2:02:14] <element_of_loyalty> GODS DAM IT ELMO
[2:02:14] <+LNutt> when do you guys think he'll actually accidentally show his balls on stream?

[2:02:51] <$konekoryugamine> and fried tofu is AWESOME
[2:02:54] <arcaderabbit48> @konekoryugamine That's the worst. I feel so bad for our pets when they need meds, but its not like I can tell them that!
[2:02:54] <%SuperCasualBoom> I feel kinda happy and kinda sad for creating Pat as Mr Whiffle Pickles. Lol
[2:02:55] <%mostundesired> Pat thirty minutes from now "Okay so Elmo wouldn't take the medicine and I ended up eating it myself"
[2:02:58] <TalisKanju> I know a couple who've been together for over 10 years since high school and still haven't considered marriage
[2:02:59] <%XzileGaming> Pat will come back with claw scratches across his face
[2:03:08] <element_of_loyalty> LUL
[2:03:10] <+LNutt> deep fried tofu is best
[2:03:14] <jeecay> the price one pays when they anger lord elmo

[2:05:55] <%mostundesired> Wow, they really didn't hesitate to reuse Dragon's Dogma sounds for this game.
[2:05:56] <arcaderabbit48> Id rather work in an office than do retail or food service again
[2:05:56] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> here's a frame of reference: Don't do it.
[2:05:58] <CrimsonSkeletons> Someone needs to build a King style Elmo wrestling mask for Pat, that would be his new gimmick.
[2:05:59] <%burgahb> apatDab apatDab
[2:06:03] <cerberuscarmine> >:O
[2:06:10] <cerberuscarmine> make paige play it
[2:06:16] <+joylent_blue> i'm never gonna find these fucking downy crakes
[2:06:18] <californaya> Generations looks exactly like it is: a 3DS game but bigger
[2:06:19] <%8BitDsx> can someone make an elmo mod for mhw, replace the cat head for the handler
[2:06:21] <$konekoryugamine> Man I need to gwt a better pc
[2:06:21] <%violetheart> GenU's _great_ though.
[2:06:22] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> office or telecom. never the fuck again.
[2:06:25] <californaya> My roommate got it, and...oof
[2:06:34] <rytisone> All I know about the Office is that people watch hentai in there and consider it art
[2:06:36] <%8BitDsx> but it's way smoother
[2:06:39] <AlasterAngelo> like that generation has gone by
[2:06:51] <+LNutt> then call me nostalgic for the old world
[2:06:52] <cerberuscarmine> oh boi
[2:06:54] <Estuko> NotLikeThis I forgot about that
[2:06:56] <+Arsimckhoi> pat i will actually die if you don't confirm shitstorm this october
[2:06:56] <cerberuscarmine> and bug nets
[2:06:57] <+joylent_blue> yeahhhh..... fuck that
[2:06:58] <$konekoryugamine> Ph wpw
[2:06:58] <%violetheart> But the game has unlimited mining and bug catching.
[2:06:59] <%swygpop> cubicle land ain't so bad. just gotta work in a company with a chill culture.
[2:06:59] <arcaderabbit48> Pickaxes??
[2:06:59] <element_of_loyalty> JHO
[2:07:01] <%SuperCasualBoom> *reads Pat’s resume*...so what skills do you have to help this company mr...*looks*...Whiffle Pickle.
[2:07:01] <CrimsonSkeletons> I have Generations, i'll sent it general delivery with 10 bucks and a empty bottle of mustard.
[2:07:01] <chocobodundee> def not a fan of styles and arts
[2:07:02] <%violetheart> It's called Prowler mode.
[2:07:05] <$konekoryugamine> Stupid thumb nails
[2:07:08] <Nobrev> pretty sure theres a free dlc that gives you a bunch of mega pickaxes
[2:07:09] <%mostundesired> The return o Whiffle Pickle!
[2:07:10] <+moosemonkey397> they actually give you TONS of crap from starter packs. like 500+ honey and potions and stuff
[2:07:15] <Rngiddion> isn't gathering while running by just so much better
[2:07:18] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> yeah the starter packs
[2:07:20] <%Sirculbs> but if u use prowler u dont have to worry bout pickaxe
[2:07:22] <$CharlesRobinJr> i started with world so generations is new to me
[2:07:23] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> just gave you 50 pickaxes
[2:07:30] <%MisterCrimson> or...you just download the free item packs that give you all the low rank gathered mats and just focus on murder
[2:07:31] <cerberuscarmine> pat wai
[2:07:32] <%violetheart> @AngriestPat Remember Prowler mode has unlimited gathering gear so if you need to go on a gathering hunt then it's a non-issue.

[2:13:50] <+Tokanova> what weapon would skelmo main if he could play? i think hunting horn because skeleton trumpet
[2:13:51] <ThatDangSkeleton> I started with World and learning about Glavenus I felt ROBBED
[2:13:52] <%Sirculbs> What about Mizutsune?
[2:13:55] <%Jjrossman> DENIED BY JAGROS
[2:13:58] <jeecay> he fell. like an asshole
[2:13:59] <+moosemonkey397> Mizu would be really cool
[2:14:06] <+skylerpilot> the Gen flag ships are all fantastic
[2:14:10] <count_bob> And then he was knocked over and I whiffed.
[2:14:10] <%mostundesired> Whiffed on carving LUL
[2:14:13] <%Everpresent_Overseer> the 4 flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations are neat too
[2:14:15] <jeecay> only assholes and lumpy neck monsters fall over
[2:14:15] <cerberuscarmine> jagras aint fucking around
[2:14:18] <+moosemonkey397> Glavenus is a personal fav
[2:14:18] <+joylent_blue> all Lagiacrus makes me think of is the underwater fighting
[2:14:19] <count_bob> And then I started to carve and I whiffed.
[2:14:24] <SchroedingersFerret> Big whiffs
[2:14:26] <demonhunter790> It’s like he’s missing on purpose
[2:14:36] <%SuperCasualBoom> Monster Hunter Kart Racing...you heard it here first.
[2:14:41] <MegboyManuel> fuck under water battles though
[2:14:41] <%Sirculbs> Lagi was supposed to be in world but the devs decided he had no place there.
[2:14:41] <+Skatedeandre> They’ve done lagi with no underwater
[2:14:42] <Big_King_Coconut> how viable is soloing this game for someone new to monster hunter?
[2:14:45] <@thenefftw> We trained him bad on purpose!
[2:14:46] <arcaderabbit48> I dont know what the underwater fighting was like, but I do know I don't want it
[2:14:50] <+joylent_blue> what if there was underwater DLC
[2:14:50] <jeecay> Wesker
[2:14:53] <%mostundesired> He's whiffing so much, Jho is actually GAINING health.
[2:14:54] <CrimsonSkeletons> Only cowards hit their targets.
[2:14:57] <SnakeMarcky> Lagi could work tho
[2:14:57] <jeecay> "christhisway"

[2:15:38] <Rellim80> Nerd brain
[2:15:41] <+KingLlama1> Damaladur ... snek supreme
[2:15:42] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> imagine if the bomb whiffed
[2:15:45] <%Sirculbs> There's footage of Lagi in World. Devs decided not to add him tho for whatever reason.
[2:15:46] <+Typhaeon> Sorry to the people in my optional, don't know why it's so unstable tonight
[2:15:49] <+skylerpilot> Nercylla and the Seltas / Queen need to come back
[2:15:56] <Johnothon> A new area would be dope, like a beach/cliff area so they could bring back some of the water based monsters
[2:15:57] <TalisKanju> Monster Hunter: Dancing in Starlight
[2:15:57] <+Grayhammatter> i want seltas
[2:15:58] <SchroedingersFerret> Whiffs are forever
[2:16:02] <Fruitywhompus> I could leave the seltas queen tbh
[2:16:02] <+Skatedeandre> @kingllama1 his skeleton is in this game too SeemsGood
[2:16:11] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> seltas and nercylla are a must with all this new environmental bullshit
[2:16:16] <Kaitepaints> Wow now I feel bad for it
[2:16:18] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat try to bitchslap Deviljho face and still whip
[2:16:24] <%SuperCasualBoom> Whiff*
[2:16:24] <+skylerpilot> @Johnothon first new area they add needs to be a cold zone
[2:16:27] <Kaitepaints> It was just taking a nap
[2:16:34] <+joylent_blue> never feel bad for jho
[2:16:35] <+moosemonkey397> random fusion is stopping me from playing P3P right now
[2:16:39] <+joylent_blue> jho is a bastard
[2:16:41] <jeecay> @AngriestPat what other types of fusion makes you want to die?
[2:16:43] <prismaticsnake> gotta break face
[2:16:45] <%mostundesired> Whiffed on reading LUL
[2:16:45] <%MisterCrimson> the fuck are you talking about random fusion?
[2:16:49] <+joylent_blue> jho's optional quest
[2:16:50] <%Agami23> arena maybe?
[2:16:57] <talisign> Stop wanting those scalps. Its the only way.
[2:17:02] <+Skatedeandre> They should add Yama tsukami, Lao and Shen gaoren
[2:17:03] <Daxalog> +
[2:17:04] <fairore> seltas tagteam fight is the coolest shit
[2:17:08] <%SuperCasualBoom> Whiffed Fusions
[2:17:09] <Kaitepaints> Why is Jho a bastard?
[2:17:12] <+seoultrain> desire sensors are strong in every game
[2:17:13] <%XzileGaming> i got work tomorrow so have fun
[2:17:18] <CatmanIX> Reminder: Session ID: 3pseatjXjuw (May experience server issues?)
[2:17:18] <Johnothon> @skylerpilot Also good
[2:17:21] <%Sirculbs> The meanest monsters that would be added to world would be Fatalis and Rajang.
[2:17:22] <TalisKanju> I still need to finish Persona 3
[2:17:25] <%bevyrage> scalps look to be on carve only
[2:17:27] <arcaderabbit48> @MisterCrimson In older MST games, the skill load out of your fused demons was random. So if you wanted/needed certain skills, you had to keep backing out of the menu to reroll the RNG
[2:17:36] <%bevyrage> low chance on capture, higher chance on carve
[2:17:37] <Fruitywhompus> i cant believe he got the fucking gem before anything
[2:17:48] <AncelDeLambert> aim for the head, baby
[2:17:49] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat I haven't carved a jho yet and I've gotten like 7
[2:17:50] <%mostundesired> Whiff on scalps LUL
[2:17:50] <demonhunter790> Cool leg is hard
[2:17:52] <+Skatedeandre> Akantor, Ukanalos
[2:17:52] <+moosemonkey397> gems are pretty common in world i feel
[2:17:55] <%SuperCasualBoom> @taliskanju you have to. Persona 3 final battle is epic and classic in my view.
[2:17:59] <+Gustave_XIII> And a gem from a carve too. Phuck
[2:18:00] <%bevyrage> face break is for scale
[2:18:04] <%Sirculbs> bring a lot of pit trap
[2:18:10] <%bevyrage> also tallfang
[2:18:13] <AncelDeLambert> oh damn, it's only on the carve list
[2:18:14] <%swygpop> Watch Pat Whiff ...and Watch Pat Nene
[2:18:19] <AncelDeLambert> gotta brute force him
[2:18:22] <TalisKanju> @arcaderabbit48 OH MY GOD am I glad they got rid of that
[2:18:27] <Tucker0603> do you need to do beyond the blasting scales to see Deviljho?
[2:18:33] <Brutal_Defeat> Check the list in game
[2:18:41] <Fruitywhompus> The face of regret
[2:18:50] <count_bob> Rath spikes.
[2:18:56] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Tonight on Pat Whiffs At: Scalp Quest is a no-go and more WHIFFS
[2:19:05] <+moosemonkey397> its a picklebast
[2:19:05] <+joylent_blue> blast the jhojho
[2:19:07] <count_bob> They require back break and carves.
[2:19:07] <%mostundesired> Blast your jhos bois apatDab
[2:19:08] <%ECRead> Kreygasm
[2:19:13] <%bevyrage> looking at the roll results, 10% chance on rewards, near 50% per carve
[2:19:14] <arcaderabbit48> @TalisKanju Yeah, it sucked. And there were still Fusion Requests like in 4 and 5, so you HAD to get certain persona with certain skills and chain them down a line of RNG.
[2:19:15] <+superkeaton> rooGasm
[2:19:18] <%kysath> Kreygasm
[2:19:20] <%SuperCasualBoom> @supernotsuspiciousman PatsWhiffAt 👍
[2:19:28] <Fruitywhompus> how long do you think youll be streaming?
[2:19:36] <AncelDeLambert> YOU FUCKERS ARE TOO FAST
[2:19:45] <%bevyrage> there's also a ton of items that are on carve only in world, but their reward rates are +30%
[2:19:47] <demonhunter790> It’s gonna be a B L A S T

[2:19:57] <mayorrev> c:
[2:20:06] <%SuperCasualBoom> How has God Whiff Pat Today?
[2:20:11] <+skylerpilot> @Johnothon yeah. We need that zone to get things like Barioth, Gammoth, Zamtrios, Lagombi, screw Khezu. Also maybe at some point Shovel Face could come back
[2:20:11] <+joylent_blue> THE HANDLER HAS A CAT HEAD
[2:20:13] <%MisterCrimson> @arcaderabbit48 which games were those? In 1 and 2 every demon had specific skills since you couldn't level them up. Nocturne had skill inheritance, but that's not random. IV and Apocalypse is the same story as Nocturne.
[2:20:26] <+Grayhammatter> what soul?
[2:20:30] <%mostundesired> What soul? Kappa
[2:20:33] <DracaenaLeaf> I am finally back home and can cuddle my cat
[2:20:34] <talisign> Elmo is a reverse-chest burster
[2:20:36] <zal_silverfang> but arent you ginger?
[2:20:42] <segychan> smooth
[2:20:43] <%Sirculbs> He succeeded, right?
[2:20:44] <%mostundesired> Am I nuts or is that a small jho?
[2:20:47] <+joylent_blue> you did the thing!
[2:20:49] <Fruitywhompus> love is stored in the elmo
[2:20:51] <%SuperCasualBoom> How has God Whiff Mr. Whiffle Pickles Today
[2:20:58] <%Everpresent_Overseer> He was trying to snuggle it's self into the cozy pit where the soul should be at
[2:20:59] <+Grayhammatter> that's a super small jho
[2:21:02] <%gunslinger_xxiv> I looked away
[2:21:03] <+joylent_blue> that's kind of a small jho
[2:21:05] <element_of_loyalty> Meh
[2:21:07] <segychan> I SAID SMOOTH YOU NEEDY FUCK
[2:21:07] <talisign> Sure Pat, whatever
[2:21:07] <ProRJHunter> Saw what
[2:21:07] <$RaikenTB> that was ok.
[2:21:08] <%bevyrage> he did it
[2:21:09] <Graywolf_the_45th> saw what?
[2:21:10] <+superkeaton> bad
[2:21:11] <%commanderclaw> I legit wasn't looking
[2:21:11] <%skizzuto> saw what?
[2:21:11] <+joylent_blue> eh
[2:21:11] <%ECRead> it was ok
[2:21:11] <%swygpop> nani
[2:21:12] <%mostundesired> Saw what?
[2:21:16] <DeadBlu3ey3z> noice
[2:21:17] <count_bob> It was good, but it's a small Jho.
[2:21:17] <LovableCastiel> i didn't see anything
[2:21:18] <%Sirculbs> Huh?
[2:21:18] <Avatar_Beifong> Ok for a greatsword player
[2:21:18] <+joylent_blue> it was what was expected
[2:21:20] <+moosemonkey397> that actually is a kinda small pickle
[2:21:20] <arcaderabbit48> @MisterCrimson P3 was random at the very least. I haven't played Nocturne in a while so I don't recall hot it went. I never got too in to IV or IVA. Strange Journey had it too, but they had items called Sources to teach your demons other stuff anyway.
[2:21:21] <+SvenHolgersson> Meh
[2:21:22] <+Gustave_XIII> The baybeejho~
[2:21:23] <Nordguy> huh?
[2:21:25] <count_bob> You can't hit the big ones.
[2:21:27] <Borealum_EX> normalin normalin
[2:21:27] <nekodelic> you whiffed the whif
[2:21:28] <%SuperCasualBoom> It’s fine. It’s fine.
[2:21:29] <%MisterCrimson> I guess that twitter guy was right about Pat needing his ego stroked
[2:21:32] <%MisterTylerrr> Your Desire Meter isn't going to let you carve a scalp you know... apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:21:32] <demonhunter790> I missed it, do it again
[2:21:36] <%bevyrage> is pat forgetting that you can hit the monster during mounts in world?
[2:21:43] <%bevyrage> GOOD TRADE
[2:21:43] <+joylent_blue> LUL
[2:21:44] <PumaOfDarkness> I tabbed out, I saw NOTHING.
[2:21:44] <grayjammer> was paying attention to my tarot cards. I missed what you just did. BTW: Your furure looks pretty bad, man.
[2:21:46] <%mostundesired> LUL
[2:21:49] <%ECRead> LUL
[2:21:51] <+Grayhammatter> the trade PogChamp

[2:22:03] <element_of_loyalty> belly stroke
[2:22:06] <+superkeaton> LUL
[2:22:06] <Bouldus> yea, true
[2:22:08] <%kysath> With MHW on PC now, is there any point in getting it on PS4? Don't know if my computer could handle it...
[2:22:09] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Whiff me more Kreygasm
[2:22:09] <Mr_Strut> Because of what else she strokes
[2:22:09] <+joylent_blue> shut up you love it
[2:22:12] <+Gustave_XIII> coxSuure coxSuure coxSuure
[2:22:14] <Fruitywhompus> Negative attention is still attention
[2:22:15] <Bouldus> youd jump out the window
[2:22:16] <hntronium> Its because she's partially disabled
[2:22:24] <%mostundesired> SHE WHAT LUL
[2:22:26] <element_of_loyalty> TRUE
[2:22:27] <arcaderabbit48> @MisterCrimson Also, throughout the series, demons do have specific inheritance tables they draw from but that doesn't always guarantee you'll get what you want. Especially when combining 3, 4, or 5 Persona at once
[2:22:27] <%swygpop> cause you like the tsun tsun
[2:22:28] <+Valison> You get you ego stroked watching her fail to solve puzzles in portal 2
[2:22:28] <hntronium> So you don't need your ego stroked
[2:22:30] <$RaikenTB> LUL
[2:22:38] <demonhunter790> YOU WHAT!!
[2:22:38] <DeadBlu3ey3z> PowerUpL SwiftRage PowerUpR
[2:22:40] <$RaikenTB> Pat likes the abuse.
[2:22:47] <zal_silverfang> @mostundesired twitter. trust me it is worth it for the laugh
[2:22:53] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat Nah pat don't you see, that is WHY YOU NEED IT NOW
[2:22:55] <talisign> Pat likes the tsundere type, confirmed.
[2:22:56] <Fruitywhompus> Pat watched eva way too young
[2:22:59] <+claudesavegely> I've used the name Quint since like 2009 Pat I'm not out to get you
[2:23:03] <+joylent_blue> jho's hip check attack pisses me off to no end
[2:23:05] <hntronium> Pat, your ego is stroked every time she confirms that she's disabled
[2:23:07] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> please whiff
[2:23:15] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> boo
[2:23:18] <demonhunter790> Don’t whiff this
[2:23:19] <%Sirculbs> BOOM SHAKALAKA!
[2:23:25] <+twin_triggers> HOOTAHS MUST HOONT
[2:23:35] <%bevyrage> watching pat and some randos blasting over the face of a pickle is a good way to spend an evening
[2:23:36] <%SuperCasualBoom> What would Pat as Mr Whiffle Pickle be dress like I wonder...
[2:23:44] <Kaitepaints> That was awesome
[2:23:46] <+joylent_blue> LUL
[2:23:50] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> NICE.
[2:23:51] <%mostundesired> The return of the Whiffle Pickle!
[2:24:08] <%mostundesired> Pat's developing the ability to make the Jho whiff too PogChamp
[2:24:08] <%kysath> Probably one of those suits with the big shoulders covered in pickles.
[2:24:12] <%skizzuto> you need to channel your whiff powers to make the monster whiff instead of you
[2:24:12] <talisign> @bevyrage and also the waifu discussions. Like true gentlemen
[2:24:13] <+joylent_blue> the wide-range users are the real heroes
[2:24:13] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> you hit that ground GOOD
[2:24:22] <+claudesavegely> is Deviljho just breathing pure anger at you
[2:24:28] <%MisterCrimson> @arcaderabbit48 I remember hating Soul Hackers because Demons had to build friendship with you in order to fuse them and the friendship gain was random.
[2:24:41] <+claudesavegely> boo
[2:24:42] <+joylent_blue> also known as pure anger
[2:24:46] <zal_silverfang> why not both?
[2:24:46] <+NWR_James> dragon anger
[2:24:48] <Zinectrik> Pat's lying, it's pure anger
[2:24:49] <element_of_loyalty> ST ANGER
[2:24:50] <%MisterTylerrr> What is Dragon breath MADE OF though?
[2:24:55] <%swygpop> pickle breath?
[2:24:56] <%mostundesired> Anger, it seems.
[2:24:58] <+Bloodxb> dragon anget
[2:25:03] <arcaderabbit48> @MisterCrimson And if you had them do things they didn't like, they would gradually listen to you less! It sucked and its one of the biggest reasons I couldn't get in to that game
[2:25:07] <$SirTerribleh> RATHalos
[2:25:08] <%MisterTylerrr> It would be Rahj or Tigrex
[2:25:09] <ThatDangSkeleton> Hangry
[2:25:12] <Nordguy> but dragons breathe fire though?
[2:25:14] <+NWR_James> ANGRY hunger
[2:25:14] <SleepyMaribo> Tigrex is anger personafied
[2:25:14] <+SvenHolgersson> Lies and slander
[2:25:15] <+AntithesisEK> concentrated dragon, ULTRA pulp.
[2:25:15] <%skizzuto> so he's hangry
[2:25:15] <+Valison> Not Rajang?
[2:25:19] <MyDarkStorm> the hungry dick
[2:25:20] <+Grayhammatter> tigrex is always pissed
[2:25:21] <%kysath> Headline: Pickle so angry he breathes pure hate
[2:25:21] <Fruitywhompus> Tigrex is also Hangry
[2:25:23] <%Kirijuo> What is Rajang definded as
[2:25:24] <%bevyrage> dragon breath is made out of molecular godzillas
[2:25:24] <+joylent_blue> jho is gluttony
[2:25:25] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Jho just wants to eat guys
[2:25:27] <%mostundesired> Frankly, there's a lot of anger-defined monsters.
[2:25:28] <tacostarvedbeast> isnt that big monkey the angry one?
[2:25:29] <Tucker0603> and Bazel is Tsundere
[2:25:36] <+twin_triggers> RaJANG love to fight, like Goku
[2:25:37] <+claudesavegely> so Tigrex is Pat?
[2:25:38] <%Sirculbs> Thinking anout putting out my build that I use in World. It gives you the biggest Health bar possible as well as the biggest stamina bar, max earplugs, wide range, max weakness exploit and max partbreaker. Should I release it?
[2:25:38] <%SuperCasualBoom> Angerererer...?
[2:25:46] <%MisterCrimson> Rajang, Fatalis, and any fury virus carrier
[2:25:51] <demonhunter790> I don’t see hunger so much
[2:26:01] <Estuko> Tigrex is so angry his roars hurt players
[2:26:02] <arcaderabbit48> @claudesavegely Tigrex doesn't whiff nearly as often
[2:26:03] <talisign> Rage pickle vs Rage raptor
[2:26:03] <%kysath> Are there any monster like Phalanx, that are just chill and don't really try to fight you?
[2:26:04] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> nice dodge
[2:26:07] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat what about the dragon that has actual jet engines built into it?
[2:26:07] <%swygpop> so is this why devilhjo uses other monsters as battering rams?
[2:26:09] <+claudesavegely> oof

[2:26:28] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat That's not Astalos, that's Valfalk
[2:26:34] <ooblagis> So is this fight considered easier, or harder than Behemoth?
[2:26:34] <+NWR_James> can I get volcano wings?
[2:26:35] <Estuko> Dalamadur best girl
[2:26:37] <%Sirculbs> You meam Valfak?
[2:26:41] <+moosemonkey397> Astalos is the lightning one
[2:26:41] <Daniel_Is_I> Astalos is the lightning dragonfly dragon
[2:26:45] <%mostundesired> Astalos is lightning.
[2:26:45] <%MisterCrimson> Astalos is electric bug dragon
[2:26:45] <MyDarkStorm> I can't replay this game now
[2:26:47] <+Zundelle> astalos is lightning boy
[2:26:48] <%Sirculbs> yes
[2:26:50] <%Kirijuo> Volcanoes are not weirder than jet engines wtf
[2:26:51] <tacostarvedbeast> whats a good bug monster?
[2:26:53] <+Grayhammatter> astalos is the transparent lightning man
[2:27:07] <arcaderabbit48> Kirin is a horse who is also a dragon
[2:27:07] <Estuko> @tacostarvedbeast the... I forgot it's name, spider ones from 4
[2:27:08] <%SuperCasualBoom> Deviljho spewed in his Nike’s cause Colin Kaepernick became the face

[2:27:16] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat yeah Ast is lightning
[2:27:17] <%bevyrage> oh hey, wouldn't chameleos be envy?
[2:27:18] <+moosemonkey397> Ya know who doesnt need to come back? Chameleos. thats a dumb dragon.
[2:27:21] <%bevyrage> or greed
[2:27:24] <+BioHunter> devijho is just anjanath? thats kinda disappointing
[2:27:24] <ThatDangSkeleton> I don't know how I did this shit without Rocksteady Mantle
[2:27:25] <%gunslinger_xxiv> How am I supposed to hold all these MONSTERS
[2:27:26] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Tigrex would be pretty cool in MHW, but, I would love to see some more new critters, don't mind seeing blade boi come in so we have all three invaders.
[2:27:26] <+Gustave_XIII> Sparky hoss, what do?
[2:27:27] <%MisterCrimson> best bug type monster is the deviant Ceanataur
[2:27:31] <$actionhank87> hold onto your ass assholders LUL
[2:27:34] <+omegasis> when's rajang for that hot rajang dick tho
[2:27:34] <Estuko> @BioHunter doodStare
[2:27:40] <%bevyrage> @MisterCrimson what about metal gear mantis
[2:27:42] <%Everpresent_Overseer> I like Chameleos
[2:27:44] <deviljhojho94> hot monkey dick
[2:27:48] <%bevyrage> or even celtas queen
[2:27:55] <+TheSmerdis> Just got done hunting Jho for the night, got a gem my first hunt, andjust a SHITTON of tails
[2:27:57] <+Gorgen> Hey degenerates
[2:28:05] <%SuperCasualBoom> @actionhank87 Hold onto your whiffle, pickles!!
[2:28:05] <%Agami23> is zorah magdaros even really a elder dragon? doesn't have four legs and wings.
[2:28:09] <Estuko> that chameleos bow from MH4U Kreygasm
[2:28:09] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat wouldn't Massacre Demon Diablos or Blood Bath Diablos be the RAGE MACHINE?
[2:28:16] <deviljhojho94> elder dragons are weird
[2:28:17] <zal_silverfang> @bevyrage naw, Greed would be the shiny queen
[2:28:18] <+BioHunter> hey i was just expecting something cooler with a name like that
[2:28:22] <%mostundesired> je suis monte
[2:28:22] <Estuko> @deviljhojho94 LMAO
[2:28:24] <deviljhojho94> there is an elder dragon that is just a big floating piece of land
[2:28:31] <+Grayhammatter> now he hit the thing
[2:28:33] <%Sirculbs> Yama?
[2:28:37] <%MisterCrimson> @Agami23 Elder Dragon is just a classification for monsters that don't fit into another category
[2:28:38] <deviljhojho94> yea yama
[2:28:43] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Canadian Pickle Mounting
[2:28:43] <arcaderabbit48> @deviljhojho94 Zorah Magdaros, or someone else?
[2:28:45] <deviljhojho94> kirin is also an elder dragon
[2:28:46] <%bevyrage> @Agami23 elder dragon classification is a catch-all for something so powerful it can affect the environment drastically overnight
[2:28:50] <%Sirculbs> Yama might translate well into World.
[2:28:56] <%shin_garbage> If we're talking REAL ANGEREY Bloodbath Diablos is literally so mad her blood boils and comes out of her pores as steam so there's that.
[2:28:59] <deviljhojho94> @arcaderabbit48 nah man its called yama something, its just a big cthulhu head
[2:29:00] <tacostarvedbeast> he got up so fast
[2:29:01] <%SuperCasualBoom> Elder Dragons like get off my lawn!!!
[2:29:02] <+joylent_blue> zorah has four legs doesn't it, i swear they yell out "It's getting back on all fours!" during that quest
[2:29:03] <deviljhojho94> also an elder dragon
[2:29:07] <Archmortal> god the Vaal GS is so cool looking
[2:29:08] <%MisterCrimson> Behemoth is an Elder Dragon
[2:29:11] <+BioHunter> what greatsword is that?
[2:29:17] <talisign> What about Whale Sea Serpent?
[2:29:19] <+skylerpilot> @shin_garbage exactly!
[2:29:27] <arcaderabbit48> @deviljhojho94 Yama Tsukami, apparently
[2:29:32] <%Sirculbs> Yamatsukami I think. Might be spellin it wrong.
[2:29:37] <%MisterCrimson> Caedeus is an elder dragon
[2:29:47] <MyDarkStorm> Pat your nuts
[2:29:54] <deviljhojho94> @arcaderabbit48 yeah thats the lad. Absolute unit,Looks nothing like a dragon, still an elder dragon
[2:29:55] <+Masutasodo> Caedus has such cool armor tho
[2:29:57] <+superkeaton> @AngriestPat who is your fave of the new Elder Dragons?
[2:29:59] <Daniel_Is_I> Abyssal Lagi is worse than Goldbeard
[2:30:00] <deviljhojho94> I GRINDED GOLD BEARD FOR AGES
[2:30:04] <+KingLlama1> does PC have the special event greatsword ? the one with the jet booster ?
[2:30:11] <%MisterCrimson> Hey, caedeus is awesome, the underwater fighting just sucks a pickle
[2:30:15] <deviljhojho94> Nerd Gigante
[2:30:21] <+Grayhammatter> nice hit PogChamp
[2:30:22] <ThatDangSkeleton> Nerg is a Charismatic boy
[2:30:23] <%DrFacilier> i thought Bazelgeuse was everyones favorite
[2:30:31] <Zinectrik> Shout out to Behemoth being a elder dragon
[2:30:33] <deviljhojho94> bazel is not an elder dragon i think
[2:30:34] <%Sirculbs> Bazel isn't an elder
[2:30:39] <%bevyrage> bagelgoose is my legit favourite, but is not an elder dragon
[2:30:39] <Daniel_Is_I> I think the elder dragon I want to see back most is Amatsu

[2:30:53] <arcaderabbit48> @deviljhojho94 I find it funny that Elder Dragon is apparently just code for Problem. Kirin is a horse, but can conjure up storms at will, but its certainly no dragon
[2:30:53] <Jaxnos> everyone hates kirin
[2:30:56] <+superkeaton> @MyDarkStorm everyone hates Kirin

[2:31:07] <Archmortal> @tacostarvedbeast that was Dalamadur iirc
[2:31:07] <%MisterCrimson> I think they need to add Nakarkos. He would fit in perfect with rotten vale
[2:31:08] <PumaOfDarkness> And has dog beans on his feet.
[2:31:09] <+joylent_blue> not a soul alive that doesn't hate Kirin
[2:31:11] <%SuperCasualBoom> He Whiff right pass you.
[2:31:11] <deviljhojho94> Nah the guy that created the rotten vale was a monster from MHH4U, an absolute unit lad, pretty cool fight
[2:31:14] <deviljhojho94> Forgot the name tho
[2:31:20] <deviljhojho94> It meant tower serpent
[2:31:23] <cerberuscarmine> caught it
[2:31:24] <Jaxnos> these kirin lovers are just Kirin alt accounts

[2:32:22] <%bevyrage> out of curiousity, was metal gear mantis an elder dragon?
[2:32:22] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> NO SCALPS 4 U
[2:32:28] <%MisterTylerrr> i would love to see the Old God Boss Thing from Gen in 1080p
[2:32:28] <deviljhojho94> man mh4u was the hypest shit
[2:32:29] <+omegasis> Metal Gear Bug is fucking great man; its loads better than xeno
[2:32:31] <+moosemonkey397> the twoheaded crtazy bone dragon is super cool
[2:32:31] <+joylent_blue> you got dung pods though PogChamp !!!
[2:32:31] <%shin_garbage> @AngriestPat Everyone talks about the obvious monsters to come back to World but who would be your favorite freak pick? also Atla Ka is a fun ass fight you heathen
[2:32:38] <demonhunter790> I like kushala’s design
[2:32:39] <deviljhojho94> i think rex was a brute iirc
[2:32:44] <%Sirculbs> I wanna see monsters gated behind ridiculous requirements like back in the old days
[2:32:46] <Archmortal> MH4U is still my favorite cuz of shit like the Chaos Gore armor.
[2:32:46] <Xiangchang> I think Kulve Taroth is pretty Kuul.
[2:32:47] <%mostundesired> @shin_garbage Qurupeco or riot
[2:32:48] <Daniel_Is_I> I want to see Dire Miralis come back in some form. He was a fun fight, in spite of the water sections
[2:32:50] <ThorW> Pat you're my hero cause you fetishize bug monsters
[2:32:51] <%President_Miyazaki> Wait, you hate Athal-Ka?
[2:32:51] <Estuko> @deviljhojho94 I fucking loved it, the danger of being eaten by various monsters was an absolute blast, like the web pull
[2:32:52] <%Sirculbs> That Tar monster was awesome
[2:32:52] <Jaxnos> may the desire sensor destroy your life, pat. as it does for it all.
[2:32:59] <+moosemonkey397> Kecha Wacha is my freak pick. or arzuros
[2:33:10] <+Grayhammatter> kecha wacha is a FREAK
[2:33:13] <Estuko> @Archmortal the horns Kreygasm, but Deviljho's Esurient Z's set was my absolute favorite.
[2:33:14] <%Remery_> @Xiangchang Yes I love undressing monsters <3
[2:33:17] <Daniel_Is_I> @Sirculbs Hail Gog
[2:33:20] <%MisterCrimson> Massacre Demon Diablos
[2:33:20] <deviljhojho94> @Estuko There was a pretty real sense of progression too. And getting to g rank and gettin your ass kicked by an ash kecha? Hilarious
[2:33:24] <%Agami23> i want nakarkos in world
[2:33:27] <%crot45> my freak pick is Khezu
[2:33:29] <arcaderabbit48> I understand why they aren't here. This game was a gamble and packed full of brand new models and new gameplay changes. That's totally understandable, I don't blame them for the limited monster roster. But wow do I want to see some of those bugs everyone talks about.
[2:33:30] <Big_King_Coconut> Pat is a... guy
[2:33:35] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Stroke his ego he needs it
[2:33:36] <MyDarkStorm> so is gold demon coming next month

[2:33:51] <Estuko> @deviljhojho94 god I was such an ass feeling like the hottest bitch being a veteran LUL I forget G-rank doesn't pull punches
[2:33:51] <+Grayhammatter> pat is certainly A guy. but is he cool?
[2:33:53] <+omegasis> it'd prob be hard af to motion capture the bugs
[2:33:53] <demonhunter790> Gold demon you say?
[2:33:56] <%Sirculbs> Khezu > Giggi
[2:34:04] <Daniel_Is_I> Do you mind sharing the session ID again?
[2:34:08] <CatmanIX> Reminder: Session ID: 3pseatjXjuw (May experience server issues?)
[2:34:09] <+moosemonkey397> get khezu out of life
[2:34:09] <Estuko> @Sirculbs Khezu's screeching, yup
[2:34:10] <Daniel_Is_I> Oh well nvm then
[2:34:10] <%mostundesired> Desire Sensor is truly the biggest enemy of Pat Pat's bizarre adventure.

[2:34:55] <Estuko> @deviljhojho94 it was just me and one other lad the entire way through, I took a photo after beating that last master test lmao
[2:34:55] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> nibelsnarf is a terrible fight
[2:34:58] <%crot45> Khezu, Rajang and Chameleos

[2:36:02] <Estuko> @deviljhojho94 Gog > Xeno, those beams are terrifying and much more intimidating

[2:39:48] <ThorW> The CPU usage and the GPU demands on this game are ridiculous
[2:39:48] <VeryTricky> theres a mod thats helps that
[2:39:59] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat that young Whiffersnapper

[2:40:13] <+cherrycottontail> pattron why is your computer so baby
[2:40:13] <cerberuscarmine> droppin frames like devil may cry
[2:40:16] <VeryTricky> its makes it use logical cores instead of trying to make it use 32 cores or some shit
[2:40:16] <rytisone> thanks Denuvo
[2:40:19] <Archmortal> my favorite thing about the fucked CPU usage is how every time I break a B-52 part in multiplayer the game locks up for half a second
[2:40:24] <Cthulos> Bears know when you're on your period
[2:40:44] <%swygpop> @AngriestPat any word in the patch notes on optimization for smoother gameplay? or no?
[2:40:47] <Estuko> @mostundesired I encountered verything, Bitter Black is where the real big kids play lol, but yeah. I didn't like being grabbed and kidnapped

[2:44:56] <cluster188> is the light shining on dropped items on the floor an option you can turn on?
[2:44:57] <Moonlight_Grimoire> okay, yeah looking through some older MH monsters (MHW is my first game) an archipelago zone (like three islands) and timberline to glacial zone are two that together would be great for adding monster variety to the game. No aquatic fighting, but, allow for more water monsters to show up. Like Tiger-stripe Zamtrios and Tetsucbra, and the Leviathans.
[2:44:58] <+Grayhammatter> oof, that hurt
