[0:24:23] <+alphonseisbest> omg Woolie gonna fight Dante
[0:24:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat isn't bad at arguing, people insert their own head-canon to the universe into every conversation
[0:24:25] <%TheDullaMAN> Twitted is a Bad Place
[0:24:25] <%HyperCharge_Sam> Twitter is great
[0:24:27] <EASrake> The air gets dirtied with bees and cubes pretty quickly on twitter
[0:24:27] <EuropantLamprey> Twitter is a pit of Miasma
[0:24:30] <%TheDullaMAN> Twitter*
[0:24:33] <%ComfortableStranger> Lupus > gout
[0:24:33] <+Ell1ot> i like watching people complain at Paige
[0:24:38] <%akuda_bar> apatDab cubes
[0:24:38] <%konekoryugamine> Twitter is a huge garbage fire
[0:24:39] <JamvaanPS4> 240 Characters don't leave any room for nuance.
[0:24:40] <+d00msdaydan> do combo
[0:24:40] <CaptainKarite> agreed
[0:24:41] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> woolie's chat is literally just reciting battle theme lyrics while he clears the last floors of bloody palace
[0:24:42] <NewWaveMasquerade> Twitter's a bad place in general.
[0:24:42] <%badchoice5> That...was you "Styling"?
[0:24:42] <Jontman42> Social media was a mistake

[0:24:55] <%konekoryugamine> Better style than to sit
[0:24:55] <%MintyFishbowl> My favorite extreme sport is joining a forum and arguing with the mod with 10000+ posts
[0:24:59] <%AncelDeLambert> it's funny watching Paige btfo them

[0:25:38] <Intolerable> "PAIGE THE HAND" IS WHAT PAT USES WHEN THE REAL THING IS GONE.

[1:09:29] <majindusto> YOU DIDN'T DIP HARD ENOUGH
[1:09:33] <arcaderabbit48> @TheWallOfMeat Exactly. Which is a shame, because I do otherwise like these Archives. They're a little annoying at times, but the enemies aren't too bad and there's a good bit of storytelling here with the second Crystal Sage
[1:09:45] <TheWallOfMeat> @eco419 does it count as exploring if this is a replay?
[1:09:46] <+MarshallLee67> pat happy now

[1:10:31] <+Ssaik> red dead fans DABBED on
[1:10:32] <%Rngiddion> red dead is terrible for streaming
[1:10:34] <%Remery_> But the Drifting Horse :(
[1:10:35] <+DZiffer> nah you are right, Pat
[1:10:35] <$ooblagis> Red Dead, and pretty much every Open World Sand Box just gets boring after 10-20 hours
[1:10:37] <B_ikki> but the horse balls tho?
[1:10:38] <cizal11> it's a better stream game for sure there's something about it
[1:10:39] <OkamiDude15> when will pat play xenogears on stream? sfhTHINK
[1:10:39] <dekkitout> exploring the heat death of a society is fun ya dig
[1:10:40] <%skizzuto> I couldn't give less of a shit about red dead
[1:10:44] <Thalchampz> i agree, dark souls is relaxing to me noowadays
[1:10:45] <%badchoice5> I literally couldn't finish the Red Dead stream, it' so slow
[1:10:47] <%seaearthandsky> whats up angry one
[1:10:48] <%DedlokPM> I can believe dumping red dull redullption for dark souls 3
[1:10:48] <arcaderabbit48> Those Red Dead streams were painful to get through. That game is so slow
[1:10:52] <Bouldus> red dead really wants you to take your time, so it forces it
[1:10:53] <serpenttucker> @AngriestPat What are your thoughts on immortal: Unchained?
[1:10:56] <majindusto> Fuck Netflix
[1:10:56] <cureneckbeard> You're picking up souls pretty fast. You'll have 100k back in like ten minutes at this rate
[1:10:58] <based_lobster> S U C C
[1:11:02] <valriot> RDR2 is fuckin dry oatmeal
[1:11:02] <+chaumiester> Kind of red dead out at the moment. It was like when every streamer and lets play was playing Detroit: Become Human. A Brain break is nice
[1:11:03] <JamvaanPS4> Red Dead's hard to play in any way but for yourself. It's like marathoning a netflix series, you don't do that with an audience.

[1:15:06] <TheWallOfMeat> So neither of the two most interesting-looking additions to the world in DS3 are given enough detail to actually understand?
[1:15:12] <%GoogleyGareth> Cover your head in McFlurry ice cream
[1:15:16] <based_lobster> Get GLAZED

[1:18:56] <%badchoice5> See Pat, he takes enough noise abuse and became immune, the same can go for enemy spears
[1:19:03] <TheWallOfMeat> Come to think, DS3 in general feels like it has a ton of cool ideas that aren't given enough detail to make sense, so you just end up with cool design elements that feel hollow. It's like the vagueness level has been turned up to 11 from DS1.
[1:19:04] <brambobelurkin> does he have it set up so we can invade like douche bags?
[1:19:06] <%Faustgesicht> oof sorry stray
[1:19:10] <%GoogleyGareth> Oh no spook arms
[1:19:12] <%NovaKnightmare> we are born of the wax made men by the wax undone by the wax

[1:20:00] <arcaderabbit48> @TheWallOfMeat Yeah. Yeah, you hit the nail on the head. It doesn't really answer any questions, or raise any new ones. It throws some flashy stuff in your face, shrugs its shoulders, and just kinda wanders off at the end. Its really sad.
[1:20:00] <Finakala> ChampGundy best boss

[1:22:12] <eco419> is safe
[1:22:13] <%violetheart> It's totally reachable.
[1:22:13] <arcaderabbit48> Death
[1:22:13] <+Gorgodrn> You can noclip to the castle from "regular Firelink"
[1:22:17] <%AncelDeLambert> it's reachable, just not from there
[1:22:21] <%GoogleyGareth> I remember more of this game than I thought
[1:22:22] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat there's like 2 items down there iirc
[1:22:22] <cizal11> cainhurst had the same problem sometimes
[1:22:23] <brambobelurkin> the winged guys are there but you can go down
[1:22:23] <+Noni321> Come to Anime Expo next year, Pat.

[1:24:19] <BoBoCatBurger> Hey I everyone question here I played through almost all of DS2 with that plain berserk lookin great sword with an enjoyable amount of resistance. I want to go back and play DS1 would I be able to do the same thing or would I have to use a different ultra great weapon? I did see Paige’s bumble through so I know there are must stronger weapons but I really like using a huge but otherwise normal looking sword.
[1:24:20] <aiyobro> I thought those were gargoyles i have no idea what they are
[1:24:21] <%GoogleyGareth> aww

[1:24:40] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 Good evening Big Dipper Big Ginger. Life decided to throw a curve ball today. Running errands, got cut off on the highway and in order to avoid, I swerve to the next lane that had me run over a huge pothole and my car fucked up now. $700 bucks to fix. There goes half my paycheck. At least I got Pat being big and strong and fail on rolling on lower platforms. Thanks butt chugs. Hey, wanna hear a good joke? What do you call a Smash player who showers? HA! THERE’S NO SUCH THING! 😎👍

[1:31:14] <+other_badger> ANIMAL SKELETONS DO COUNT

[1:31:23] <majindusto> Shes Got the BONE fetish
[1:31:23] <VritraReiRei> @PeachSaliva so people were arguing which stream to watch, Pat or Woolie's stream. So Pat said that put both streams up and imagine each stream as a TIDDY and try to stare at both at the same time
[1:31:28] <EMP_Ike_Turner> She wants that Bone Zone
[1:31:28] <arcaderabbit48> Okay, but what about Sans and Papyrus? Because they are monster skeletons
[1:31:32] <$Niney_Who> Skeletons do not count

[1:45:34] <%TheWallOfMeat> @hawk_rush even DS3 itself can't explain that
[1:45:35] <MettleWolf> Angels in Dark Souls need to go on a diet

[1:45:48] <SulfurousAcid> Make Claymore big
[1:45:51] <$renyrells> its too bad he was a bitch
[1:45:53] <booglesnurf> Stormcast let themselves go
[1:45:57] <+thebestestkevin> sucks that you cant get all the elite versions of the armor sets
[1:45:59] <jijipose> Slab my shit up

[1:46:03] <deviljhojho94> we dont know shit about them
[1:46:05] <cizal11> @hawk_rush can anyone explain how the dragons came to exist? ehhhh its dark souls
[1:46:06] <%Remery_> @hawk_rush God has a weight limit on his angels, you go over the limit, he kicks you out
[1:46:07] <%badchoice5> So are these Angels like Futurama Angels?
[1:46:08] <Frostydough> okay but where is my Bloodborne 2 tho
[1:46:08] <captainthunderwolf> Well you see, Miyazaki understood that the Souls lore was sort of making sense at this point.
[1:46:10] <pentagrahams> the boys were not big enough
[1:46:17] <rosemon5001> climb to the top
[1:46:17] <myranfen> Wait...does he have...POISE?
[1:46:17] <captainthunderwolf> So he said, "Fuck you, the serpents have legs now."
[1:46:24] <Kaitepaints> Pat is still hungry
[1:46:24] <captainthunderwolf> "Also angels. Trees? Fuck off."
[1:46:29] <deviljhojho94> OH LAWD THEY FALLING
[1:46:32] <dekkitout> oh- yeah that sounds bout right
[1:46:44] <Tophat12> Estus soup probably doesn't taste good
[1:46:47] <%badchoice5> TIME AND SPACE ARE CONVOLUTED SHUT UP
[1:46:48] <+sundizzle> no shut up though
[1:46:57] <SulfurousAcid> game into denial
[1:47:00] <%TheWallOfMeat> This feels like some goofy architecture, what with the railing around the edge of a roof
[1:47:00] <eco419> dont lie
[1:47:00] <%hawk_rush> @cizal11 Dragons were part of dark souls from the beginning -- they were in the intro. Angels just came out of nowhere
[1:47:03] <captainthunderwolf> "Lore and canon are convoluted in Lordran."
[1:47:03] <B_ikki> no it's lore
[1:47:04] <majindusto> If only they were Redeemer-like angels
[1:47:11] <%thunderdutch> Estus Flasks are full of Devil Jizz.
[1:47:31] <cizal11> @hawk_rush that intro is in itself propaganda of the gods though
[1:47:34] <%badchoice5> THEY'RE JUST CONVOLUTED GET OFF TIME AND SPACE'S BACK
[1:47:39] <TioXyco> You talk like Time and Space makes sense in dark souls at all
[1:47:41] <Bubbygumpers> look at all the bootiful butterflies
[1:47:41] <%TheWallOfMeat> Ah, the !not Bloodborne ring
[1:47:42] <burna_lova> A hoonta must hoont!
[1:47:45] <cizal11> @hawk_rush we just don't know what happened before the dragons
[1:47:52] <rosemon5001> how boot the dragon place
[1:47:52] <+Gorgodrn> You wouldn't be able to see it from here
[1:48:07] <majindusto> Not Allowed to See
[1:48:09] <captainthunderwolf> Anyway, the fucking butterflies and the new dragons and shit are all made of roots, people are turning into trees, and the Archtrees are the bedrock of reality itself.
[1:48:17] <B_ikki> man there should be a sick boss in this cage
[1:48:21] <+sundizzle> ah the cage that makes no sense
[1:48:22] <captainthunderwolf> So it seems like the cycle of cycles is ending and the trees are asserting themselves.
[1:48:23] <DracaenaLeaf> time to die
[1:48:25] <%badchoice5> "Gawrsh Sora, the Darkness sure has convoluted Time and Space, Hyuck!" -Goofy
[1:48:26] <%hawk_rush> @cizal11 true. I just wish we got a bit more about the angels
[1:48:29] <%vanillaicyjojo> apatWhat
[1:48:33] <Bubbygumpers> damn trees
[1:48:35] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat I actually got into that cage on my first run by accident
[1:48:36] <eco419> dont fall
[1:48:48] <Xiangchang> The last member of the Royal Condom Authority. RIP.
[1:48:50] <captainthunderwolf> Now why do the trees take over when reality itself ends? Go fuck yourself.
[1:48:51] <deviljhojho94> Bitch
[1:48:51] <SulfurousAcid> worm lyfe
[1:48:53] <%NovaKnightmare> run a dub dub thanks for the grub
[1:48:54] <%TheWallOfMeat> Why is there a slugman here??
[1:48:55] <Intolerable> FART WORM
[1:48:59] <$rdark_ksu> .....ok that thing looked like a uncircumcised dong
[1:49:07] <+sgtlaggy> if anyone's trying to invade, just put a red sign Kappa
[1:49:10] <B_ikki> what kinda dong you been around
[1:49:11] <arcaderabbit48> @TheWallOfMeat Asset reuse
[1:49:13] <%Ninestempest> holy shit wtf i've never seen these
[1:49:16] <Make_me_mad> I like the idea that over time everything in the dark souls universe gets a turn to run wild on the world. First it was just darkness and fire, now the water and the trees are getting in on it.
[1:49:16] <majindusto> FUCK YOU SLUG BUTT
[1:49:17] <dekkitout> rip the royal condom's they protected the best they could
[1:49:19] <IShadowStrykerI> but pat the rafter kill big guys...or are you not as big as TARKUS
[1:49:21] <%HiroTSK5> EVERYONE IS HERE
[1:49:21] <+MarshallLee67> LUL
[1:49:22] <burna_lova> ladder
[1:49:23] <%Ninestempest> this is in the archives?
[1:49:26] <eco419> LUL
[1:49:30] <+MarshallLee67> ye @Ninestempest
[1:49:32] <Inebriateddonut> good message
[1:49:35] <%MagickBurritoh> The lighting fucks up like it's an illusion wall
[1:49:39] <%Ninestempest> fuck me I've never been up there
[1:49:44] <+SimplyPandaz> Yo pat you should play BloodBorne on stream
[1:49:46] <captainthunderwolf> In all honesty, I think Miyazaki was just pulling for elements from the previous stories in a thematic sense without actually constructing any narrative. It's all recurrent themes without any specific storyline.
[1:49:46] <arcaderabbit48> The Dark Souls world also started out as nothing but stone and giant trees, so I thionk that is also a factor?
[1:49:50] <majindusto> GOT YOU
[1:49:53] <captainthunderwolf> I'm nearly 100% certain of that.
[1:49:58] <SulfurousAcid> a divine blessing
[1:50:04] <SulfurousAcid> item Pat will never ever use
[1:50:17] <%TheWallOfMeat> Does anybody use blessings?
[1:50:23] <B_ikki> nobody uses blessings
[1:50:25] <+sundizzle> nobody does
[1:50:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOU HAVE TO SAVE IT FOR THE FINAL BOSS GUYS
[1:50:27] <%badchoice5> Why is Pat 100%ing when he has a complete build?
[1:50:29] <arcaderabbit48> @captainthunderwolf The Dark Souls series was not supposed to last 3 games, and it shows. Its really quite sad, but you're completely right
[1:50:31] <captainthunderwolf> PVPers use Blessings.
[1:50:33] <$Niney_Who> I do
[1:50:33] <eco419> hackers
[1:50:34] <%hawk_rush> I would love for pat to do a bloodborne run
[1:50:37] <simulationbard> what if i need them for an emergency
[1:50:46] <CheekyBirb> who needs divine blessing when sun princess ring exists Kappa
[1:50:49] <+sundizzle> terrible, hard to find, a waste of resources
[1:50:49] <cizal11> @arcaderabbit48 wasn't supposed to last 2 games even
[1:50:54] <rosemon5001> is mustard a curse?
[1:50:55] <%TheWallOfMeat> I guess since they cure status effects it can be useful
[1:51:00] <B_ikki> when need them you dont have then equipped because when you don't they waste a slot
[1:51:02] <Worldbrand> yee haw
[1:51:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat gets Elmo pet buff

[1:51:13] <Kaitepaints> Gross
[1:51:14] <%badchoice5> It's not even really a video game, so it'll fit great on this stream
[1:51:14] <captainthunderwolf> @arcaderabbit48 Agreed. From can construct settings, but I genuinely doubt they have the focus to fully construct a good narrative inside of them.
[1:51:15] <+MarshallLee67> I DON'T GIVE A FLYING SHIT
[1:51:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Can you stream it
[1:51:17] <arcaderabbit48> @cizal11 True. Dark Souls as a series buckled under its popularity
[1:51:18] <Vlad_Tech> Oh hi der anglLURK

[1:51:59] <arcaderabbit48> @captainthunderwolf Like, I really want a Bloodborne 2 in the sense that I loved the BB gameplay. But I dread the thought of a BB2 because of what it would do to the story, setting, and lore.
[1:51:59] <%HyperCharge_Sam> @HiroTSK5 the biggest thing is you can select all this buffs with a radial wheel instead of just pressing B

[1:52:32] <captainthunderwolf> @arcaderabbit48 That's the problem. It'd actually be super easy for any competent writer, but From gets a little up their asses with the esoteric nonsense.

[1:52:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> Boy would I have been ecstatic if Shantae was a playable character in Smash, but I'm honestly just glad she shows up at all. Even as a Spirit.
[1:52:52] <%HiroTSK5> Even then there were area Shulk lacked in i.e. most of his attack having long statrup/delay
[1:52:57] <%vanillaicyjojo> I want V gameplay
[1:52:58] <%deviljhojho94> @Rancaliber_ Hey thanks buddy! PogChamp love ya
[1:52:59] <%badchoice5> That's nice Pat but TALK ABOUT YOUR STREAM WITH LIAM

[1:53:22] <nepwar> oh i thought that stream already happened
[1:53:22] <wsintai> Guide their hips Pat
[1:53:25] <SulfurousAcid> oh cool, I can see all the stuff I did wrong
[1:53:27] <%izaich> nyuck nyuck nyuck
[1:53:30] <Twoiis> I'm assuming on PC?
[1:53:31] <%deviljhojho94> dont know whot to do
[1:53:34] <%OdysseyKnight> Mentor Pat time
[1:53:35] <MettleWolf> Yo sounds dope
[1:53:35] <%ComfortableStranger> say hai to space mom
[1:53:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Just tweet it Pat
[1:53:36] <hntronium> What tuh du
[1:53:38] <%Remery_> I wish Pat was guiding my hips
[1:53:38] <simulationbard> i just restared warframe on switch
[1:53:40] <gryffinp> It'll be like the main channel video! But with more DDOSing!
[1:53:42] <%badchoice5> Will Liam be there?
[1:53:44] <%GoogleyGareth> Get a Burning Team Captain
[1:53:49] <%deviljhojho94> D:
[1:53:49] <+Chud_Pudsley> I dont buy hats. I buy warframe plushes.
[1:53:49] <hntronium> The coolest Pats to buy
[1:53:49] <Cobaltor_252> wait where is this happening tomorrow?
[1:53:51] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Pat help me settle an argument. When you think of a Kobold do you think of a dog lookin thing or a lizard looking thing?
[1:53:53] <arcaderabbit48> @captainthunderwolf It does. Like, the core story of Dark Souls 1 was actually pretty coherent, its when you got to NPC stories that stuff got weird and ambiguous. But DS3 just feels like Miyazaki doesn't even know the answer to the questions he's posed.
[1:53:54] <+JavaManJoJo> the final endgame
[1:53:55] <tremerss> i always just play dress up with my space dolls then log off
[1:53:55] <dekkitout> gonna be hearing alot of "You see what I', saying?" and "Perfect" Kappa
[1:53:56] <Vlad_Tech> Everything about Ruk's fight for newbies NotLikeThis
[1:53:58] <SulfurousAcid> what time again?
[1:54:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do you want me to call you Patches?
[1:54:09] <+Chud_Pudsley> I only buy Kavat plushes. Ever. @AngriestPat No hats.
[1:54:09] <MettleWolf> Is the relay destroyed yet on Switch, or did you all save it?
[1:54:10] <hntronium> Kobolds are dog looking things
[1:54:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> That is what makes me call you patches
[1:54:13] <%deviljhojho94> Unbreakable Pat-Ches the hyena
[1:54:14] <+LiveStreamOnyx> But how strong will Crazy Talk affect you in telling them things @angriestpat bardSass
[1:54:16] <%Makototruth> Remember to tell them about the free money you can get with a 50% coupon!
[1:54:17] <%badchoice5> Mild-Mannered Pat is back for more
[1:54:29] <wsintai> The part where you get hit 20 times?
[1:54:32] <harraceharrison> Ah yes, it is also a castle with guys
[1:54:32] <majindusto> Im so happy K Rool is apearently so good...I decided to main him the moment he was announced!
[1:54:34] <disgruntledgruntle> @AngriestPat What's your favorite Stand?
[1:54:38] <%TheDullaMAN> Pat is the best guest for anything
[1:54:50] <Worldbrand> that makes sense because prince lothric is basically phalanxing around on the ground
[1:54:50] <%TheDullaMAN> And soon, he will be the best guest character on Smash
[1:54:51] <%deviljhojho94> @majindusto Same here, I have been waiting for K rool for forever
[1:54:52] <tremerss> man demon souls actually had some of the coolest level ideas
[1:55:02] <wsintai> @TheDullaMAN Except for trial hearings
[1:55:08] <B_ikki> twins are awesome
[1:55:09] <cureneckbeard> The true demon's souls starts here
[1:55:14] <+Ssaik> I KNOW RIGHT IT'S SO GOOD
[1:55:14] <SodiumChloride2Tough> Would pat be a good guest for smash?
[1:55:16] <%OdysseyKnight> Some spell guys mixed in would have helped
[1:55:16] <Alex_Eight> @angriestpat are there anymore videos you did with the rooster teeth guys?
[1:55:20] <arcaderabbit48> Demon Souls had some great levels. Awkward bosses, but great levels
[1:55:22] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat can explain to me where the angels came from in dark souls
[1:55:28] <sodium_station> ah yes the onii-chan boss
[1:55:31] <%DrFacilier> Lorian and Lothric's battle is one of my all time favorites
[1:55:31] <strider_kun299> max is on bye pat
[1:55:41] <benjiFG> Pat, did you know you can combine the brother's swords with Ludleth
[1:55:41] <@SSaryn> It's very unclear to EVERYONE
[1:55:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Vadi has a video
[1:55:46] <天使42199> pat crazy talks his way into smash
[1:55:46] <%OdysseyKnight> PattiVidya
[1:55:48] <zamzoph> I wish the Angels had DLC instead of what we got FeelsBadMan
[1:55:52] <+Chud_Pudsley> Dark Souls is 100% theory crafting sorry.
[1:55:52] <+TheKazmaz> Did Pat ever play Nioh?
[1:55:52] <%Bl3ssthefall3x> @angriestpat are you going to go through dlc as well
[1:55:53] <cizal11> @AngriestPat now you're fighting with a slow weapon, so you're gonna have a more interesting time
[1:55:55] <+JackMillerTime> why were they kept in big birdcages?
[1:55:56] <blackbaron98> nobody knows
[1:55:58] <+G_Thunders> No one knows
[1:55:59] <@SSaryn> That was dumb
[1:56:00] <B_ikki> U N G A
[1:56:00] <+AXL808> They came from the Land of DLC
[1:56:02] <+RushUnplugged> it's cool shit so SHUT UP BITCHES, that's where
[1:56:02] <%hawk_rush> damn
[1:56:03] <eco419> D:
[1:56:03] <Inebriateddonut> PaatiPadya
[1:56:03] <%skizzuto> saw what shit?
[1:56:04] <majindusto> It also helps that K Rool has AMAZING Music Remixes
[1:56:06] <+MarshallLee67> i rate that a 4/10
[1:56:06] <%DatLatinoGuy> YEYYEYE
[1:56:07] <arcaderabbit48> Man, I dont think Vaati even knows. They're just kinda there, dont question it
[1:56:08] <cizal11> oh my god
[1:56:09] <Caidezes> !
[1:56:11] <dekkitout> that was pretty ill
[1:56:12] <juxtest> I missed it do it again
[1:56:14] <ashuckel> stair is too strong
[1:56:15] <burna_lova> Is Demon's Souls worth playing after playing DS1-3 & Bloodborne? I've never played it.
[1:56:16] <grayjammer> Nobody knows JACK DICK about angels
[1:56:18] <+sundizzle> vaati will also be streaming soon so you can ask him there
[1:56:20] <%hawk_rush> I hate how they're just there
[1:56:20] <%TheDullaMAN> Good job Mace
[1:56:22] <+RushUnplugged> goddamn lore whiners, just take in the cool shit dammit
[1:56:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Basically its a another religion not tied to fthe first flame but was concidered heretical and thus people were killed for worshiping it
[1:56:25] <benjiFG> QUICK PRAISE THE SUN
[1:56:33] <EMP_Ike_Turner> P R A I S E
[1:56:34] <SulfurousAcid> they came from berserk
[1:56:36] <+AXL808> this run was fun with pyromancy enchant to make knights fight each other
[1:56:36] <+Bloodxb> PRAISE THE GODHAND
[1:56:38] <LixFury> There are angels because BERSERK REFERENCE
[1:56:38] <天使42199> @burna_lova I played it after every other souls game and its my second favorite\
[1:56:40] <+Chud_Pudsley> IT MUST STANK
[1:56:41] <disgruntledgruntle> @AngriestPat What's your favorite JoJo's Stand?
[1:56:41] <+SaurianCrash> Lothric getting on his brothers back to double team you is so sill, like a pool party where its house back fighting
[1:56:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> Use Arc of Deliverance on Lorian!
[1:56:43] <majindusto> PRAISE ECLIPSE
[1:56:45] <cizal11> that's a noise
[1:56:48] <booglesnurf> GURRIFISSUUU
[1:56:49] <valriot> the Twin Price Greatsword is one of my favourite weapons, its sooo sick
[1:56:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> due to the nature of belief in dark souls some of them BECAME ANGELS
[1:56:54] <+Chud_Pudsley> BIG STANK CATHEDRAL WIND
[1:56:55] <arcaderabbit48> Really, really looked like the DLC would tell us more about the angels. And then once again, the game just kinda shrugged at us.
[1:56:58] <dekkitout> all that wind, that place must smell dank in a bad way
[1:57:07] <tremerss> arc of deliverance is the greatest move in gaming histroy
[1:57:11] <%deviljhojho94> we're all angel snow apatDab
[1:57:11] <%Gogogolem> so pats going to the dragon peak next right?
[1:57:12] <tremerss> history
[1:57:14] <sodium_station> "the game just kinda shrugged at us". literally every souls game
[1:57:14] <benjiFG> no you should have
[1:57:16] <eco419> ?????
[1:57:16] <cizal11> lmao
[1:57:26] <B_ikki> weird kink
[1:57:26] <Hzer13> Don't forget underneath the elevator
[1:57:27] <captainthunderwolf> @arcaderabbit48 FromSoft is a strong example of a good gameplay mechanics team who need a dedicated writing staff, like even just one fucking dude, as opposed to relying on their creative director for a job he didn't go to school for.
[1:57:27] <+pwnjones> get the slab?
[1:57:28] <cizal11> pat where are you going
[1:57:31] <Mr_Strut> Man why did the first flame fuck things up so bad? Before it was just some dragons and rocks sitting around.
[1:57:31] <+Bloodxb> shortcut porn
[1:57:37] <%OdysseyKnight> I think they got over-reliant on elevator shortcuts
[1:57:38] <cizal11> @pat why are you just going back the elevator
[1:57:45] <eco419> aaaaah ok
[1:57:55] <simulationbard> i wish this bonfire was on the other side of that arena
[1:57:58] <%mister___doctor> WAAAow
[1:57:59] <ashuckel> you just sent the elevator up pat
[1:58:00] <+sundizzle> he's changing his spawn, thats it
[1:58:02] <+pwnjones> slab
[1:58:03] <captainthunderwolf> @Mr_Strut If those dragons weren't pussies, they probably wouldn't have gotten killed by all of those philosophically-enlightened zombies so fast.
[1:58:04] <TheEdrem> Wow
[1:58:06] <+TheShal> Remember! Ride the elevator down!!
[1:58:11] <EMP_Ike_Turner> BONE SHART
[1:58:15] <grayjammer> I have problems with how they connect Elavators into the levels in DS3, but that's a big nitpick nobody cares about
[1:58:15] <Cthulos> How about DS2's elevators? lol
[1:58:15] <Hzer13> Ride it down
[1:58:17] <arcaderabbit48> @captainthunderwolf He's gone on record saying he didn't want to do any Dark Souls beyond the first, but the contracts were out of his hands and he got roped in to it. So, that's definitely a factor.
[1:58:17] <+G_Thunders> DS3 has a ton of cut content dealing with world state changes. I think originally the angels were dragons you’d see flying around, not these pilgrim butterfly guys
[1:58:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Too be fair @captainthunderwolf its the reason why the game gets love
[1:58:19] <$Niney_Who> oh my god no

[1:59:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Demons were the chaos flame's fault
[1:59:11] <captainthunderwolf> @doc_ock_rokc I actually don't feel that's true. I think that Dark Souls is beloved because it's mechanically strong AND has a unique worldbuilding style, but I think a more cogent writing style would strictly benefit it.
[1:59:11] <EMP_Ike_Turner> THE MAN IN GAUZE

[2:01:53] <%badchoice5> Don't be Demon-racist Pat
[2:01:54] <+Rshiners> i don't think it would turn back to gray, i think with the first flame being created the concept of darkness is created too, where instead of gray it's just dark forever

[2:02:56] <captainthunderwolf> Dark Souls also has this infuriating problem with the worldbuilding, which is that all of the Souls come from one place: The Flame. The Flame can feed on the Dark Soul. The Dark Soul is an infinite fuel source for the Flame that never goes away, and this incredibly meaningful dynamic is barely addressed.

[2:03:37] <buffmurffy> i love when the person who kills you is super polite or even kind about it
[2:03:40] <MettleWolf> Bosses that talk shit after you die are great.
[2:03:41] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Don't know what would have happened though if the Demon Prince managed to do it though
[2:03:50] <B_ikki> was it
[2:03:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gwyn was a good boi
[2:03:55] <%badchoice5> Seems pretty good to me, set yourself on Fire and become a God
[2:03:55] <Slowchamp2> Dragons Dogma when Pat?
[2:03:55] <eco419> yup
[2:03:58] <Caidezes> Gwyn was an asshole.
[2:03:59] <%AlasterAngelo> "ingenius" he lit himself on fire
[2:04:03] <captainthunderwolf> Gwyn's method would have worked forever and was the best option, he just didn't commit hard enough.
[2:04:08] <arcaderabbit48> It was the best option he had under the circumstances, but still a bad option
[2:04:09] <B_ikki> "maybe ill use me as the fire"
[2:04:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @captainthunderwolf Coal isn't a solution, It runs on HUMANITY aka The Dark Soul
[2:04:12] <captainthunderwolf> Burn MORE Humanity, fuckers, it's self-perpetuating.

[2:04:16] <dekkitout> dark sould is a great procrastination analogy
[2:04:16] <cizal11> i mean yeah his solution is still happening even in this game for some people
[2:04:25] <%badchoice5> THEY BECAME AS GODS
[2:04:27] <arcaderabbit48> He didnt though??
[2:04:29] <captainthunderwolf> @doc_ock_rokc Yeah, the self-reproducing infinite resource, the Dark Soul.
[2:04:31] <Mr_Strut> Wait, Gwyn made the curse?
[2:04:32] <%GoogleyGareth> Sunlit 4 life
[2:04:33] <yukichocomilk> gwyn's idea wouldn't work forever. it was getting shittier each time because of entropy
[2:04:34] <+moranprime> Wasn't Neato the one who did that?
[2:04:36] <B_ikki> this boss is so cool
[2:04:36] <arcaderabbit48> No, god no, what
[2:04:43] <eco419> did he do that?
[2:04:47] <Worldbrand> I'm wait what.
[2:04:48] <+joylent_blue> face fuck the boss pat
[2:04:50] <Mr_Strut> I thought that was just the result of the fire dying down. People were turning back into pygmies.
[2:04:51] <grayjammer> hes talking about the Ringed City lore guys
[2:04:57] <%hawk_rush> in the ringed city dlc, it mentions he made the curse, right?

[2:05:01] <%GoogleyGareth> Ya keep rolling into them
[2:05:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> My theory as to why the first fame dies is because its incomeplete

[2:05:10] <arcaderabbit48> @grayjammer Wait, the ringed city said what??
[2:05:13] <B_ikki> Pat and R1 name a more iconic duo
[2:05:13] <captainthunderwolf> Gwyn's idea literally would have worked forever if they burned more of the Dark Soul, this is an obvious feedback loop that the games ignore entirely.
[2:05:17] <%GoogleyGareth> TAG HER IN!
[2:05:18] <%DatLatinoGuy> BROTHER
[2:05:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> The Four lords stole aspects of the flames away
[2:05:25] <%DatLatinoGuy> I'M COMING
[2:05:26] <st_jimmy456> wm1
[2:05:26] <dekkitout> TAG IN, TAG IN
[2:05:26] <Caidezes> Wincest time~
[2:05:27] <eco419> Brother
[2:05:27] <%Divryne> CRIPPLE TAG TEAM IS NOW.
[2:05:28] <+joylent_blue> B-BROTHURRRR
[2:05:29] <%violetheart> Ringed City confirms that fire is a curse put on humans. I think the general idea is that the fire "burns away the humanity" inside a person, leaving them an empty husk, thus hollowing.
[2:05:31] <%deviljhojho94> ITS NOT OVER YET, BROTHEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR
[2:05:31] <Videogamer4> BibleThump BibleThump
[2:05:33] <%NovaKnightmare> Gwyn is such a great character, he isnt perfect but he isnt some secret evil asshole. Hes just flawed in his views of Humanity and the dark soul and how to stop it
[2:05:35] <%GoogleyGareth> FROM THE TOP ROPES
[2:05:36] <%mister___doctor> MARIOOOOOOOOO
[2:05:36] <%violetheart> They lose their humanity because Gwyn's a dick.
[2:05:37] <dekkitout> Can you spare some souls, brother?
[2:05:39] <%DatLatinoGuy> IT'S NOT OVEEEEEEEER YET
[2:05:39] <BarraTrout> mount ahead
[2:05:39] <sodium_station> Gwyn's solutions sucks, it's better to be King Dark Big Dick
[2:05:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ONI-CHAN!!!
[2:05:41] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Rise if you would
[2:05:42] <grayjammer> @arcaderabbit48 I think the factoid is contained in the Ringed Knights Armour lore
[2:05:43] <Slowchamp2> squadalaaa
[2:05:44] <%cherubsanonymous> Every single line from this character is golden
[2:05:44] <B_ikki> salad fingers
[2:05:45] <%Divryne> JUST FUCK ALREADY.
[2:05:46] <+Flashbomb7> monkaS
[2:05:46] <Kataguro> Rise
[2:05:47] <RipSlamsteak> holy shit his hands
[2:05:48] <$rdark_ksu> wow did he just shrink or what
[2:05:50] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat So, is it possible to unsribe the curse off the dark soul?
[2:05:50] <+SWindleFeD> So I absolutely love fighting this boss with the caestus, because the hit stun with them is stupid strong
[2:05:51] <eco419> Aniki uwu
[2:05:51] <%deviljhojho94> hmmmm monkaS
[2:05:52] <Josef_Stryker> TIME TO MAMORU THAT SHIT
[2:05:54] <%MagickBurritoh> "On my way" can also be said as coming haha
[2:05:54] <+NoGoodAtGames> Just get way up inside their asshole = nearly every dark soul boss and mob
[2:05:54] <RipSlamsteak> look at those fingers
[2:05:54] <%badchoice5> RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE
[2:05:55] <+Dovakhin573> Pat do you agree with the prince's decisison?
[2:05:56] <$NocturneNovember> Brother, be my legs
[2:05:57] <Mr_Strut> I never understood why the dark soul was so persistent. Shouldn't it have weakened with the flame?
[2:06:00] <Intolerable> CUT YOUR NASTY NAILS
[2:06:01] <simulationbard> just beat his ass well he's talking
[2:06:02] <Supabait> ANIKI Kreygasm
[2:06:03] <st_jimmy456> lip flaps PogChamp
[2:06:04] <+Dao_Puppy> While we're at it. Who is Yorshka? Why is the flame moving locations and not just great souls, or if not, why is nameless 10 feet away from Anor Londo? Whatever happened to Flan, did he break Gwen's heart? Are he wolfboys literal anime fans? Is velka dead then? What does Gwyn care if pygmies do anything? Why did they nerf Miracles and make me cry?
[2:06:04] <%deviljhojho94> GWISE FWOM YOUW GWAVE
[2:06:04] <%GoogleyGareth> Woolie: "OOOOOOHH!!!"
[2:06:06] <blademaster247> Hey Pat, just saw the AH Soul Calibur video. Good job kicking their asses and I hope you mocked Woolie the entire plane ride home
[2:06:09] <Vlad_Tech> Brother, let me be your backpack MiniK
[2:06:10] <%mister___doctor> Why is Patron just letting this happen
[2:06:10] <+redstonej> psst get up bitch
[2:06:11] <%cherubsanonymous> "Rise, if you would. For that is our curse." Entire series summed up right there.
[2:06:13] <%deviljhojho94> Wake up Aniki BibleThump
[2:06:15] <B_ikki> chosen undead meanwhile sitting there
[2:06:18] <%NovaKnightmare> Prince Lothric and the octopulets of flame
[2:06:18] <dekkitout> sends "The Family" after you
[2:06:19] <+Ssaik> I fucking love this
[2:06:19] <+Bloodxb> "I'll give the dick later if you do"
[2:06:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Some kinda cursed prince voltron
[2:06:22] <majindusto> My Brother!
[2:06:23] <blackorchidKI2> Look at this HeroAca shit
[2:06:24] <+Ssaik> that image is dark souls to me
[2:06:24] <MyDarkStorm> EMBER
[2:06:25] <%Remery_> He should have spreaded his seed wider
[2:06:26] <+SaurianCrash> piggy back fight
[2:06:26] <Ryo_no_Kage> GATTAI!!!!!
[2:06:27] <valriot> what about Revolver Ocelotte?
[2:06:28] <%forevern2dust> !uptime
[2:06:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 6m 30s.
[2:06:29] <Pairoschuz> Imagine if Prince Lothric had a Catholic family....
[2:06:29] <%badchoice5> What would the other siblings do?
[2:06:29] <grayjammer> but he did. The unnamed sister and ocelotte are their siblings
[2:06:29] <B_ikki> this boss is sick
[2:06:32] <+JavaManJoJo> make a sibling mech
[2:06:33] <+Badgerconda_> Pat's keen observations are why I come to the stream.
[2:06:34] <StingtheKing> If he just stayed up there and casted, this fight would be impossible.
[2:06:35] <%camodikk> imagine a totem pole of brothers attacking you
[2:06:36] <+Bloodxb> the just Ll have different disabilities
[2:06:38] <daisymaisy02> I have to wonder what life looks like for a normal person living in this world. You see regular people now and again but like are there functioning towns with more than three people in them?
[2:06:41] <+Ssaik> Music Kreygasm
[2:06:46] <NiftyNox> I'm a little confused on the nature of Pygmies, I originally thought The Furtive Pygmy was the original aspect of Dark, in the way Gwyn is Light and Nito is Death. But there are multiple Pygmies in the Ringed City so... what are they exactly?
[2:06:47] <%badmr7> Releasing his limiter would be standing up
[2:06:47] <Videogamer4> MUSIC BibleThump BibleThump
[2:06:48] <%hawk_rush> so much rolling jesus
[2:06:48] <+Bloodxb> that they have make up for each other
[2:06:48] <+Flashbomb7> gottem
[2:06:49] <yukichocomilk> everything about this boss Kreygasm
[2:06:49] <captainthunderwolf> Hey, what kinda fucking psychopath names their kid Ocelotte? Just thinking out loud here.
[2:06:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Time and space are aspects of light So things get closer to the flame as it dies
[2:06:56] <eco419> Time to die Pat onichan +_+
[2:06:58] <RipSlamsteak> every time I tried to fight this boss it bugged out and he barely moved
[2:06:59] <Josef_Stryker> MAMORU TIME
[2:07:01] <%deviljhojho94> Kings are stupid due to all the inbreeding
[2:07:02] <sodium_station> these guys have a KILLER boss track tho
[2:07:05] <arcaderabbit48> @grayjammer They branded the armor and its wearers, but is that the dark sign itself? It looks like it, but every part of that implication goes against Dark Souls 1 super hard.
[2:07:05] <%DrFacilier> Lorian/Lothrics theme and Sifs theme are number 1
[2:07:06] <%AbnormalVoid> Lothicc
[2:07:10] <%maskedriderhero> When they gonna make a Souls style game set in Indian mythology kind of setting, imagine that bullshit
[2:07:13] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate Lothric so much, man
[2:07:13] <+Mr_Jumbles> talk shit get hit
[2:07:15] <%deviljhojho94> dragon kings are even dumber
[2:07:17] <captainthunderwolf> @NiftyNox Story contrivances without clear or meaningful definition.
[2:07:17] <Rada150> yeah his body is regenerated but he still cant use his legs
[2:07:27] <+G_Thunders> Lothric’s kind of right though? No one ends up linking the flame anyway
[2:07:29] <%AncelDeLambert> that Wesker shit is so dope
[2:07:31] <NiftyNox> Ah
[2:07:32] <+Dao_Puppy> @NiftyNox IMO all the properties of pygmies they got from which should they obtained. But that's just me it seems.
[2:07:35] <%NovaKnightmare> aww
[2:07:35] <MyDarkStorm> 2
[2:07:35] <+Chud_Pudsley> Is it just me or is Dark Souls like... very GUNDAM?
[2:07:36] <pur_foncho> Can you get Lorian's armor?
[2:07:36] <%badchoice5> PAT HAS BECOME AS A GOD
[2:07:38] <B_ikki> If you like VoHiYo
[2:07:38] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 84
[2:07:38] <%forevern2dust> F
[2:07:40] <%HyperCharge_Sam> now thats a setup there
[2:07:42] <+MarshallLee67> THIS SPOT MARKS YOUR GRAVE
[2:07:44] <+bluemooneyes> boss is ass btw :tf:
[2:07:44] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Zapping system
[2:07:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> I would adore a Gailic Dark souls
[2:07:44] <%violetheart> @NiftyNox The furtive pygmy split their dark soul among humanity. The lords of the ringed city just have a bit more, I think is the idea. Thus they're the defacto leaders. Humanity's strengths were in their numbers.
[2:07:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pwned
[2:07:45] <%badchoice5> Firey Bois: 2, Pat: 0
[2:07:47] <ashuckel> imagine the multiple brothers piled up over each other, and the bottom one loses health constantly during the fight due to being squashed
[2:07:47] <%deviljhojho94> GIVE IT UP FOR NUMBER 84
[2:07:48] <+Mr_Jumbles> TALK SHIT GET HIT! LUL
[2:07:49] <dekkitout> you can dance if you like
[2:07:51] <JimJamr> This boss music is easily my favorite
[2:07:52] <%Remery_> The best Tag Team
[2:07:53] <+joylent_blue> yeah Oceiros shoulda named his son Shalashaska instead
[2:07:55] <%HiroTSK5> You can get Lorian's sword
[2:07:57] <%GoogleyGareth> Those projectiles just keep coming and they don't stop coming and they do-
[2:07:57] <rosemon5001> SLUMBER PARTY whit a sickly fuck and a gripple
[2:07:58] <%Laecerelius> MAWK YOW GWAVE!
[2:08:02] <cureneckbeard> Why is he so huge
[2:08:04] <Josef_Stryker> TALK SHIT GET HIT
[2:08:05] <+pwnjones> I feel that locking on to a boss that teleports isn't a good idea
[2:08:06] <%deviljhojho94> What the fuck is shalashaska anyways
[2:08:10] <ronyncato87> So, if the fight resets, how is there continuity?
[2:08:11] <captainthunderwolf> @joylent_blue Now you're thinking.
[2:08:11] <iwa5h4ck3d> Twin Princes probably top 3 hardest boss in this game
[2:08:11] <majindusto> Lothric just wants to Mamoru his Brother BibleThump
[2:08:11] <%HiroTSK5> Pretty much all I used for post-game/DLC
[2:08:12] <$RubberFistFight> Still luggin around Vordt's hammer?
[2:08:14] <%badchoice5> WISE FWOM YOU GWAVE
[2:08:15] <MyDarkStorm> sadly yes
[2:08:15] <eco419> maybe he got the regeneration" after loosing his legs
[2:08:15] <+SaurianCrash> lost use of his legs cause they fused their souls
[2:08:16] <+111111sagas111111> Need The Count from Sesame Street
[2:08:17] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 Fun to say.
[2:08:18] <$rdark_ksu> believing in Pat's folly? You have to ask?
[2:08:22] <blademaster247> Hey Pat, just saw the AH Soul Calibur video and congrats on kicking their asses. I hope you mocked Woolie the entire plane ride back.
[2:08:23] <+Bloodxb> "local man tag teamed by twin cripples"
[2:08:28] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Pat btw, the dark sign is a natural occuring thing
[2:08:28] <%deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf Hmmm, I suposse
[2:08:30] <dekkitout> i believe his words were "Nothing personal, kid"
[2:08:31] <xxdj1173xx> Yes yes we can pat
[2:08:42] <nepwar> pat not as strong as two people with a handicap
[2:08:46] <%deviljhojho94> how can you forget about nameless king tho
[2:08:51] <yukichocomilk> has pat done DLC?
[2:08:53] <eco419> No he isnt
[2:08:56] <valriot> No hes not
[2:08:58] <+Dao_Puppy> @deviljhojho94 There's a hole tape in MGS V explaining the convolued nature of that name. Something about local afghan or russian translations I think?
[2:09:02] <+111111sagas111111> man he does not hesitate
[2:09:05] <%hawk_rush> how can defeating crippled people be so hard
[2:09:05] <tremerss> nameless king is probably the coolest looking boss that exists
[2:09:06] <%badchoice5> Ginger dwarf punishes twin brothers with big rod
[2:09:06] <cizal11> if only they didn't stagger so easily
[2:09:13] <Kataguro> Literally Excalibur
[2:09:13] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 Wouldn't have forgotten if his name was Shalashaska, that's for sure.

[2:09:28] <blademaster247> Hey Pat, just saw the AH Soul Calibur video and congrats on kicking their asses. I hope you mocked Woolie the entire plane ride back.
[2:09:29] <NiftyNox> You gonna do the stylish kill on Ancient Wyvern or the regular way
[2:09:29] <grumpiestchris> @angriestpat what weapon are you using?
[2:09:30] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Oof
[2:09:31] <MyDarkStorm> need a break?
[2:09:31] <Hzer13> Nameless king is the coolest looking boss, yes
[2:09:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pats gotta learn
[2:09:32] <%AlasterAngelo> you can rest there too if you like
[2:09:38] <%thunderdutch> Prince moved on you like a bitch.

[2:09:40] <+Dao_Puppy> @AngriestPat Did you know if you use the dried fingers your character gets a 10% damage buff right?
[2:09:40] <+redstonej> LORIAN IS SO FUCKING COOL
[2:09:45] <pentagrahams> it's a good thing this fight has never given pat trouble
[2:09:48] <%badchoice5> Who names their kid Vordt?
[2:09:49] <+Devilike__> He's using Vordts greahammer
[2:09:49] <%deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf The only reason I remember it is because we are always laughing about it
[2:09:51] <B_ikki> never ever given him trouble
[2:09:52] <cureneckbeard> !uptime
[2:09:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 9m 54s.
[2:09:53] <%maskedriderhero> Borts Hammer
[2:09:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> Favourite thing about the Flame of Chaos is that it actually worked. Just not in the way they wanted. They created an entirely different form of beings. But they still made a source of life that could be re-lit. Just not by the Undead or Unkindled.
[2:09:58] <+redstonej> borks hammer
[2:09:59] <ronyncato87> Called a Hammer except it's literally a mace
[2:10:01] <%OdysseyKnight> Boruto's Greathammer
[2:10:02] <Vlad_Tech> Pat, just believe in your self, and always remember. It's hammer time.
[2:10:10] <eco419> Crazy talko
[2:10:11] <+Devilike__> Yeah it should be called 'greatmace'
[2:10:13] <%deviljhojho94> The demons should have inherited the world
[2:10:17] <%thunderdutch> Jorts Hammer?
[2:10:17] <%deviljhojho94> they are cute
[2:10:21] <%camodikk> did they buff most boss weapons? is it in past patch notes?
[2:10:24] <katocrimson> I tuned in jus in time for oni-chan boss fight
[2:10:25] <%badchoice5> Have you begun to develop an immunity to fire and light magic yet?
[2:10:26] <NiftyNox> @goose_attack_almanac huh... never thought of it that way but youre right
[2:10:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> PAT DON'T BELIEVE IN YOURSELF BELIEVE UN US WHO BELIEVES IN YOU
[2:10:28] <+Devilike__> Pat you should put on the exile helm, its more minmax than Gundyrs helm
[2:10:34] <+Chud_Pudsley> @AngriestPat I believe in the me that believes in you!
[2:10:35] <cureneckbeard> My hammer is also called Bort
[2:10:35] <sodium_station> Man don't even get started on weapon names, "SPLIT LEAF GREATSWORD" is a fucking halberd
[2:10:35] <nepwar> pat use the power of the slam and be welcomed to thejam
[2:10:47] <arcaderabbit48> The Flame of Chaos was also really interesting because it was implied to be so overflowing with life, it turned the surrounding statues and architecture in to living beings.
[2:10:47] <+LogothX> He nothing personelled
[2:10:53] <%deviljhojho94> HEY YOU WATCHA GONNA DO
[2:10:55] <+RushUnplugged> We need more Vordt license plates in the Gift Shop. Repeat, we are sold out of Vordt license plates.
[2:10:55] <captainthunderwolf> @goose_attack_almanac That's sort of my point. We'll ignore the fact that you can burn the Dark Soul literally forever and keep the Flame going literally forever - if everyone's so afraid of entropy, make a new Chaos Flame and become weird insect people, stop being such cowards and get in on the spicy mandibles while the chance is still there.
[2:10:58] <+Dao_Puppy> Does frostbite affect PVE that much? I thought it was a PVP thing?
[2:10:59] <%Big_Dream> that's okay because everyone to just moves to a new painted world and thus the cycle of stupid continues
[2:11:05] <eco419> f
[2:11:05] <deathsmions1> pat he doesnt have legs

[2:11:23] <blademaster247> Have you considered killing him instead of dying?
[2:11:24] <HyraFukit> @deathsmions1 Legs or not, he has a brother teleporting him.
[2:11:24] <MettleWolf> You're getting old and slow PAT

[2:14:38] <blademaster247> Congrats Pat, you defeated a cripple and her caretaker

[2:15:59] <%captainthunderwolf> @Ssaik The only sad thing is these games is all of the Bonfire Keepers the MC never tries to wife. A problem dating back to Demon's Souls, no less.
[2:15:59] <+Chud_Pudsley> @AncelDeLambert He's going for 2.5 ending he says

[2:16:48] <%deviljhojho94> Patricio del Boivino or as I like to call him Patrick O'Boivin due to his Irish heritage
[2:16:51] <eco419> invade his ass
[2:16:52] <+SlappyMeats> Pictured: Atmosphere
[2:16:54] <+Gorgodrn> Then they made an area out of this concept and it's even better

[2:17:02] <B_ikki> that bonfire is so dumb btw
[2:17:04] <+moranprime> The end of all timelines.
[2:17:04] <badwinkles_> the first thing I do every NG run is go and change the music
[2:17:05] <$RubberFistFight> BWARRRRMMMM
[2:17:05] <%cylish> notice how its all grey unless sunlight is directly hitting it
[2:17:10] <+Devilike__> Yeah ruined by the million bonfires lying around

[2:17:15] <%GarbageNirvana> So if I understand this right is this game the reason why bonfires are so radical?

[2:17:24] <%captainthunderwolf> @Ssaik They get paler, more vulnerable, and I'd assume by visual language alone, more fertile with each passing game. A damn shame that nobody ever takes the, "Use my immortality to repopulate the earth" route.
[2:17:24] <cizal11> TIME FOR DLC BOIS
[2:17:25] <nepwar> LUL

[2:17:30] <+Devilike__> I mean Cinder is easier than the DLC
[2:17:33] <NiftyNox> I wonder what exactly caused the Chaos to die out, as it appears based on the last demons in Dark 3. The Bed of Chaos was killed in 1, but Chaos still raged, and if you'd call the Demons of 2 real Demons and not just a catch-all term, they thrived in many different forms
[2:17:35] <%b0neh34d> DLC TIME BOIS

[2:38:00] <$Niney_Who> ????
[2:38:02] <Sadolerlaqzarret> 76 IS GREAT
[2:38:02] <dekkitout> now THATS disappointment
[2:38:03] <%Verd_254> 76 is worse because it's from a big studio.
[2:38:04] <Caidezes> Fallout 76 came from a big developer with infinite money.
[2:38:04] <nepwar> no man sky was a big lie, fallout was a big crash
[2:38:04] <velemi> ???????
[2:38:05] <%captainthunderwolf> Fallout 76 had Bethesda Money and stole canvas bags out of innocent consumers' pockets.
[2:38:05] <+barretzm> No mans shy is a game at least
[2:38:06] <%deviljhojho94> ?????
[2:38:07] <katocrimson> jojo spoilers?
[2:38:08] <+sundizzle> ???????
[2:38:09] <alrobot2014> while NMS wasn't much of a game, IT DIDN'T DELETE ITSELF
[2:38:14] <%DrFacilier> NMS worked but had no content. Fallout 76 has content but...is broken af
[2:38:14] <%deviljhojho94> DO IT COWARD
[2:38:15] <Nemesis2098> 76, NMS was boring but completeable without big bugs
[2:38:15] <+eldritchbee> ANSWER COWARD
[2:38:16] <nepwar> ?
[2:38:16] <$rdark_ksu> do it do it do it do it
[2:38:16] <RCtiger0> 76 by a longshot
[2:38:17] <Gregorhasjoined> Dino Dio?
[2:38:18] <+FadingEmber> NMS is boring and 76 is a mess
[2:38:19] <Bouldus> jojos spoilers dont make sense
[2:38:19] <%Baesel20xx> also 76 was made by a company who should know better
[2:38:20] <+Ssaik> monkaTOS
[2:38:22] <$Mendin> Shadow Dio from the PS1 game?
[2:38:22] <%SuperCasualBoom> You could say 76 had a...fall out. Lol
[2:38:22] <yendoria> IS IT???
[2:38:22] <+eldritchbee> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BLACk
[2:38:23] <Kalcom> do it
[2:38:23] <eco419> B I G
[2:38:24] <nepwar> OH DIO BLACK
[2:38:24] <+NekoNinja13> what's wrong with eureka seven
[2:38:24] <Bouldus> its fine
[2:38:26] <%captainthunderwolf> @dekkitout How was Eureka Seven AO, by the way?
[2:38:26] <hntronium> PAT LOVES THE BIG BLACK DICK
[2:38:27] <yendoria> BLACK DIO?
[2:38:34] <+JackMillerTime> like black haired Dio?
[2:38:35] <%forevern2dust> big black spoilers
[2:38:38] <Sadolerlaqzarret> African Dio?
[2:38:39] <%deviljhojho94> they have a plan PogChamp
[2:38:45] <dekkitout> ao betrays the objective of the first series
[2:38:46] <Worldbrand> OH
[2:38:47] <Kataguro> Watch party for TGA?
[2:38:47] <eco419> orgy?
[2:38:48] <+moranprime> @AngriestPat It's obviously NeoDio from NeoGeo Battle Colloseum
[2:38:49] <%Ninestempest> OH NO
[2:38:49] <$SGrim> It also has to do with religion if anyone who's in the know is just confused
[2:38:49] <alwayspronking> OH NOOOOOOOO
[2:38:50] <Kalcom> THERE'S NO BLACK DIO, THAT'S NOT HIS NAME
[2:38:51] <%HyperCharge_Sam> LUL
[2:38:52] <+sundizzle> DIO black? I've read all of jojo and I have no idea what he's talking about
[2:38:53] <%Ninestempest> WHAT IS ITTTTTT
[2:38:53] <$Niney_Who> Does he mean Part 6 or
[2:38:54] <st_jimmy456> ps allstars
[2:38:55] <%chiluzza> OH NOOO
[2:38:56] <+Dovakhin573> Oh nooooooo
[2:38:56] <%captainthunderwolf> @NekoNinja13 It's too patrician-tier for most people to realize how good it is. It's got the HxH and early 2000's JoJo problem.
[2:38:56] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat who your smash main?
[2:39:00] <%HiroTSK5> Subtle
[2:39:00] <%DrFacilier> are you all gonna wrestle??
[2:39:00] <%Dr00_PhD> PS Allstars?
[2:39:00] <%Ninestempest> Didn't they already do all stars?
[2:39:05] <Vi_Stri> YEAH YEAH YEAH WE DO IT
[2:39:07] <%RNGsusDied4Wins> cheer300 your stand has been evolving. Its new form Crazy on You allows the conversion of internet salt into abstract meme creations. I look forward to what will top Bees and Cubes
[2:39:08] <NiftyNox> You can probably lame it by SDing and get them all in like an hour im guessing
[2:39:08] <%ssjklyco> Like, No Man Sky was a brand new from the ground up engine and it did what it said it would do. 76 uses an engine that was used since Oblivion, and that does not work at all
[2:39:08] <Worldbrand> @sundizzle I'll give you a hint, eyebrow haircut
[2:39:14] <%forevern2dust> !uptime

[2:39:31] <+risenlp2> Considering the amount of Pat-Stroke, this is the end of the stream?
[2:39:32] <$Niney_Who> LuL
[2:39:33] <+sundizzle> @Worldbrand I wouldn't go as far as to say that's DIO black though
[2:39:35] <%deviljhojho94> danb
[2:39:39] <%furtivestinbro> Pat see a doctor.
[2:39:42] <%captainthunderwolf> Pocoloco is racist but I'm not sure who towards.
[2:39:45] <velemi> rude
[2:39:46] <Worldbrand> I wouldn't either but i cant imagine who else he could be talking about
[2:39:54] <%animio> is pat done with ds3 now?
[2:39:55] <NiftyNox> D:

[2:42:50] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat now that its December, time to watch the Folger's Incest Commercial again!
[2:42:51] <%captainthunderwolf> No for real, caffeine and alcohol in combination can cause heart attacks, don't fucking drink a Red Bull with a Four Loko ever.
[2:42:57] <MettleWolf> Kittens love to break shit on shelves.

[2:43:10] <%SuperCasualBoom> Just kick them
[2:43:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Wrap a kitten in a warm towel like a burrito, it makes them comfy
[2:43:11] <RCtiger0> I rose feral cats in the mountains with my great aunt
[2:43:16] <+king_wragles> my tip is more of a dumb joke, but sure, spray sugar water on your kittens
[2:43:21] <%tweedler92> @eggsnbakefest Pontiff is a biiiitch 2nd tried him today
[2:43:22] <%Gogogolem> whatever you do don't cover you possesions in cocaine it will make them chew even more.
[2:43:23] <%captainthunderwolf> Cool tip: Trade your humanity for the Chaos Flame and become tall and immortal.
[2:43:25] <%forevern2dust> @thunderdutch canadian fourloko = code 4loko

[2:43:27] <%Kazooki_Kazami> DARGONS

[2:43:30] <badwinkles_> 24 hour cat wouldmake so much money
[2:43:30] <+joylent_blue> but seriously woolie got to floor 101 on bloody palace it was COOL
[2:43:31] <Blank9> if a kitten's too aggressive try and get another kitten around the same age
[2:43:34] <%Nobrev> it doesn't hurt them and they learn quick not to do things when you squirt water in their face
[2:43:37] <katocrimson> let's beat up Gywn's son!
[2:43:38] <TheOfficialNeens> dargons
[2:43:39] <majindusto> Dargons?
[2:43:40] <eggsnbakefest> I beat him first try, but he caught me super off guard
[2:43:40] <MettleWolf> Break their bones quickly
[2:43:42] <%hawk_rush> oh damn, Yorgh's Ring was cut content from DS3. Another reference to DS2 damn
[2:43:44] <+Palidanjani> Nogdar Slappin
[2:43:46] <%MagickBurritoh> Dargyns from warframe?
[2:43:46] <pentagrahams> DRAGON
[2:43:48] <Djinnazz> Nameless King should be entertaining.
[2:43:50] <st_jimmy456> 100 is the over/under death count for after nameless
[2:43:54] <DuoScratch> nameless with that build is super chump
[2:43:55] <RCtiger0> Time to slay some dream dragons
[2:43:56] <Blank9> having 2 helps a whole lot with chilling them out because they learn to socialize and work a lot of energy out
[2:43:59] <DonatelloJose> @RNGsusDied4Wins I though it was super clever when I said that on twitter. currently making a video on it.
[2:44:03] <+risenlp2> Started playing through DS2 again with a DEX build. I usually run heavy STR. its been... interesting
[2:44:06] <%thunderdutch> @forevern2dust Accurate.
[2:44:08] <Coystick> Let those dargins alone
[2:44:08] <+yourunclesmorningpaper> Gael

[2:44:19] <+king_wragles> time to watch Pat victory lap with his mace of "fuck this DLC"
[2:44:24] <majindusto> Nameless King so cool
[2:44:26] <%captainthunderwolf> @risenlp2 Interesting as in, "R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1"?
[2:44:27] <B_ikki> no builds
[2:44:31] <%forevern2dust> no stats
[2:44:33] <+LogothX> He said concept
[2:44:35] <%tweedler92> yeah i dodged away my first try @eggsnbakefest
[2:44:36] <+sundizzle> there are no builds in sekiro
[2:44:36] <%AncelDeLambert> there's not gonna be any builds
[2:44:37] <+Freelance_Astronaut> I thought there was no stats
[2:44:38] <+LogothX> As in PLAYSTYLE
[2:44:38] <%photas10> when is a good level to do the first dlc in dark souls 3?
[2:44:39] <%Gogogolem> No builds only basic bitchness
[2:44:40] <badwinkles_> I thought he was getting rid of the mace
[2:44:45] <+trekkie11041> all player skill
[2:44:46] <%AncelDeLambert> it's gonna be equip weapon use weapon
[2:44:47] <B_ikki> no weapons either
[2:44:48] <%furtivestinbro> I'm sure there will be
[2:44:48] <MettleWolf> I hope not. Sekiro should be all skill based
[2:44:49] <B_ikki> just extra tools
[2:44:50] <+JoeStillLife> LUL
[2:44:50] <alwayspronking> aayyyyy
[2:44:50] <katocrimson> attach a giant Axe to his trick arm
[2:44:51] <+sundizzle> no there won't be other weapons either
[2:44:52] <%DatLatinoGuy> pffffftt
[2:44:53] <st_jimmy456> goteeeem
[2:44:54] <yukichocomilk> NO WEAPONS Kappa
[2:44:54] <eco419> awwww
[2:44:54] <%DatLatinoGuy> aayyyyyyy
[2:44:54] <+trekkie11041> twon swords thats it
[2:44:55] <dekkitout> teehee
[2:44:55] <mayorrev> gottem
[2:44:55] <Coystick> Thing I'm liking about Sekiro: ALL horizontal progression
[2:44:55] <%HyperCharge_Sam> Wowww
[2:44:55] <+risenlp2> OOF
[2:44:57] <+Freelance_Astronaut> There's not even a game
[2:44:57] <valriot> LMAO Sekiro has ONE WEAPON
[2:44:58] <NiftyNox> Did you see Vaati's video on the possibility of a Bloodborne 2 Pat?
[2:44:59] <%TorpeAlex> @Blank9 Yeah they get along great since they're siblings but they kind of feed off of each other's energy and chase each other/team up on random household objects and curtains for hours on end.
[2:45:00] <Bouldus> pretty sure its jsut the weapons youre given
[2:45:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big ol tiddies
[2:45:01] <themagic_conch> it all makes sense now
[2:45:01] <cizal11> LMAO
[2:45:02] <%Gogogolem> No but someone is ognna hack the game so you can play with as the Oni boss
[2:45:02] <+ilnex> did paige go to the furry con the ICP guy took his kid too?
[2:45:02] <MudoBaron> no leveling in Sekiro, the weapons are obtained megaman style through certain bosses
[2:45:03] <%furtivestinbro> like a kanabo or an axe or some shit
[2:45:03] <pentagrahams> there was some kind of axe arm wasn't there?
[2:45:03] <B_ikki> your main weapon is ONLY the sword
[2:45:06] <Mechazoic_Era> limesLUL
[2:45:06] <%KessOrangeSoda> you're basically a ninja in sekiro, why would you have a big strong weapon as a ninja?
[2:45:09] <Inebriateddonut> Sekiro seems more like character action/stylish action/whatever the fuck you call those games
[2:45:11] <%PenmanLupine> she big, she slow, she eats the mustard, she paige
[2:45:12] <%AncelDeLambert> not gonna play Seki, it'll just kick my ass
[2:45:12] <%animio> big tiddy slow brain
[2:45:13] <+Palidanjani> i hope theres an odachi
[2:45:13] <Intolerable> IMMA TELL ON YOU WHEN SHE SOBERS UP, PAT
[2:45:13] <RCtiger0> so is Sekiro just Dark souls with a Japanese skin mod?
[2:45:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Im clipping that before I die
[2:45:15] <%captainthunderwolf> Sekiro has no weapons, just a grappling hook. Secret sequel to Bionic Commando.
[2:45:17] <+TheReallJimbo> Shoot, this is neat. I was just watching your playthrough with woolie and matt, just a few minutes ago
[2:45:17] <Caidezes> Pat like the big slow and Paige likes the small crazy.
[2:45:24] <Coystick> Fusion of Souls an Tenchu
[2:45:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> big oof, but it was funny
[2:45:25] <+LogothX> I'm lost too.
[2:45:26] <majindusto> He Look...He Worried
[2:45:26] <+sundizzle> pat is going to be mad when he finds out he can't be big and strong
[2:45:27] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:45:28] <%hawk_rush> oh boy
[2:45:28] <Bouldus> @RCtiger0 no thats nioh
[2:45:29] <%AlasterAngelo> @KessOrangeSoda what if you don't want to play some pansy ass ninja and just want to hit things with a stick
[2:45:30] <Bouldus> Kappa
[2:45:31] <dekkitout> no, thats nioh -or what ive been told-
[2:45:34] <eggsnbakefest> Yo @AngriestPat if you like Dark Souls-esque games, you should check out Code Vein! It's an anime souls coming out some time in 2019
[2:45:34] <faegbeard> 1
[2:45:34] <%Gogogolem> Use you dick as a compass to find the way
[2:45:34] <eco419> im lost
[2:45:37] <%AncelDeLambert> oh jesus
[2:45:37] <+king_wragles> I'm sorry about that Pat, most of us usually feel... oh, he means locationally lost. Gotcha
[2:45:37] <MettleWolf> I just want a nice buster arm in Sekiro and I'm set for the rest of the game.
[2:45:39] <MudoBaron> no stats and leveling in Sekiro, guess Pat can't overlevel in that one
[2:45:41] <+tegas_> Praise the skeleton.
[2:45:41] <%KessOrangeSoda> @AlasterAngelo then don't play Sekiro
[2:45:44] <cizal11> just figure it out
[2:45:45] <%AncelDeLambert> up ladder through sewer
[2:45:48] <%crimsonharvest> follow the smell
[2:45:50] <%1buckboom> Dragon Peak time?
[2:45:52] <%mitchteck> I think you cAn only change ur sub-weapon in sekrio
[2:45:53] <%forevern2dust> ^^
[2:45:55] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Just wait for Nioh 2
[2:45:56] <%RNGsusDied4Wins> @DonatelloJose now you got a clip to use ;)
[2:45:56] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Go left
[2:46:03] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat in the main part of the jail you have to take a right and go out a door at the end of the hallway
[2:46:06] <+Palidanjani> i can wait for Paige's Punch Rush on Pat Live
[2:46:12] <%forevern2dust> follow the smell
[2:46:19] <%TorpeAlex> Starboard
[2:46:20] <+joylent_blue> find the room with the 10 jailers walking in a circle
[2:46:20] <+risenlp2> am I crazy or was there supposed to be some kind of Animu version of dark souls being devved by FROM?
[2:46:21] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a different one
[2:46:25] <%deviljhojho94> Do it
[2:46:26] <dekkitout> 8 whole pages of paige punching pat
[2:46:31] <%Gogogolem> Okay go right now
[2:46:34] <B_ikki> you go in to the rat room and past it
[2:46:35] <eco419> yey
[2:46:40] <Inebriateddonut> @risenlp2 that's code vein and it's not developed by FROM
[2:46:40] <%captainthunderwolf> My guess is that Sekiro's gonna be slick for two months, but lack the staying power of a Dark Souls game. Hype'll build up for the next PVP Souls-like until Bloodborne 2 comes out.
[2:46:42] <MettleWolf> Fighting with a grapple hook is always fun
[2:46:42] <badwinkles_> code vein?
[2:46:52] <%Gogogolem> left
[2:46:54] <DonatelloJose> @RNGsusDied4Wins praise be RNGsus. the odds are truly in our favor. <3
[2:46:55] <st_jimmy456> camera pls
[2:46:55] <B_ikki> you got it
[2:47:03] <%AncelDeLambert> did it
[2:47:05] <+risenlp2> @Inebriateddonut TY I'll look that up
[2:47:05] <majindusto> Code Vein isnt FROMSOFTWARE
[2:47:06] <%deviljhojho94> Sekiro might not have the same staying power due to no custom character perhaps
[2:47:06] <%TorpeAlex> !uptime
[2:47:06] <pentagrahams> perfect
[2:47:06] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 47m 8s.
[2:47:09] <Make_me_mad> I'm just waiting for Nioh 2.
[2:47:09] <%badchoice5> Good job Hammer
[2:47:20] <+tegas_> @captainthunderwolf It's probably illogical to have a detailed prediction at this point.
[2:47:21] <+joylent_blue> good job mace
[2:47:24] <+sundizzle> become as dragon
[2:47:27] <katocrimson> Man can't wait for game awards

[2:47:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Now the Big Slow Paige have been saved
[2:47:42] <+joylent_blue> yeah i'm pretty hyped for the game awards
[2:47:42] <%kujofire990> Dragon Dragon rock the Dragon
[2:47:43] <Prism_Wing> ma$e? Kappa
[2:47:44] <MettleWolf> dragon?... DRAGON!
[2:47:46] <%hawk_rush> They even had Felkin's armor in the game as cut content wow
[2:47:47] <Inebriateddonut> Sekiro might have some staying power if the combat had a high enough skill ceiling. I mean look at DMC4
[2:47:48] <eco419> Love it
[2:47:50] <badwinkles_> there's the moon
[2:47:52] <%badchoice5> Think Hammer can beat the Nameless King tonight?
[2:47:53] <%AncelDeLambert> Dohvakiin
[2:47:55] <+king_wragles> kill him for wearing your clothes!
[2:47:56] <+Ssaik> It depends how diverse weapon/move options in Sekiro are, but also how limited they are in a single playthrough. We'll have to wait and see
[2:47:56] <cizal11> lmao
[2:47:58] <+trekkie11041> that name
[2:47:58] <%deviljhojho94> Nice name

[2:48:09] <eco419> ye ye ye
[2:48:11] <%captainthunderwolf> @tegas_ Eh, if it lacks the centerpoint of Dark Souls' replayability and social interaction, I feel confident. But I'll agree that there's no hard predictions yet.
[2:48:12] <DraxTD> round 2?
[2:48:12] <%Gogogolem> damn it

[2:49:31] <%deviljhojho94> That's the point, its camo crikIQ
[2:49:33] <NiftyNox> I just read a couple minutes ago some people think this are might be outside of time, which is really interesting
[2:49:33] <+trekkie11041> pat blind
[2:49:35] <majindusto> Pat, are you going to do a Lets Watch of TheGameAwards?
[2:49:36] <cizal11> big ice
[2:49:37] <B_ikki> um
[2:49:37] <+king_wragles> HUH
[2:49:39] <MettleWolf> It's almost Unreal 5
[2:49:39] <zamzoph> no they're not
[2:49:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> why?
[2:49:42] <eco419> is ur hammer + 5??
[2:49:42] <$RubberFistFight> I love how these guys are the Snekmens from Sens
[2:49:43] <@JustinianKnight> They're not?
[2:49:43] <%KessOrangeSoda> Pat is chonkin', but that other dude was SUPA CHONK
[2:49:44] <+joylent_blue> they....are?
[2:49:48] <burna_lova> What?
[2:49:49] <Ted_the_red> but they aren't?
[2:49:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Maybe the Nameless king's Name is...Sen
[2:49:52] <B_ikki> dont ruin it for him
[2:49:53] <+risenlp2> How is DS3 on PC?
[2:49:54] <Inebriateddonut> Are you sure pat?
[2:49:54] <RetributionP> what?
[2:49:55] <+sundizzle> they aren't though
[2:49:56] <+eldritchbee> Nope
[2:49:59] <dekkitout> thats because the cloaks and hoods were a good disguise
[2:49:59] <+Freelance_Astronaut> I don't think they are?
[2:49:59] <+TheSaintJohn> don't be embarrassed Pat, b/c it's not true
[2:50:00] <%kujofire990> snek
[2:50:00] <zamzoph> They're super different
[2:50:02] <+sundizzle> they're dragon men, not snakes
[2:50:03] <%captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 Instead of expansions, it's three short DLCs with like one small new area apiece and a few individual quest lines. They're $10 each and there's only three announced, with the first having been mediocre, the second having been less good, and the third yet unreleased.
[2:50:03] <DraxTD> Prove it
[2:50:05] <eco419> he means same model
[2:50:06] <+eldritchbee> The Sens fortress snakes are cobras
[2:50:09] <%Nobrev> (x) doubt
[2:50:10] <Kalcom> they look nothing like them
[2:50:10] <RetributionP> no pat
[2:50:10] <$Niney_Who> cute boysd
[2:50:11] <James_Quivers> They are, chat, they're just redesigned to not look dumb
[2:50:12] <NiftyNox> Jebaited
[2:50:13] <%Tearonex> CRAZY TALK
[2:50:13] <+eldritchbee> These are pythons or something
[2:50:16] <+sindrantz> LUL
[2:50:17] <succ699> They're not lol
[2:50:17] <+risenlp2> rekt
[2:50:17] <TheZombiepope> They're the snakemen from Anor Londo, here in Anor Londo
[2:50:17] <+yourunclesmorningpaper> Why do they look so different
[2:50:19] <Divum_muviD> stop lying Pat, this isn't an LP
[2:50:20] <yukichocomilk> they're supposed to be the same
[2:50:22] <Kalcom> pat just look at the face
[2:50:25] <Intolerable> CRAZY TALK IS AT IT AGAIN
[2:50:26] <+barretzm> Dragons aren't snakes
[2:50:28] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Do all long necks look the same to you?
[2:50:29] <B_ikki> of course
[2:50:30] <@JustinianKnight> Oh you
[2:50:30] <%ssjklyco> They did lightning
[2:50:31] <%captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 By contrast, Pillars 1 had a pair of proper expansions, even if they were both in the same area.
[2:50:32] <tremerss> LUL
[2:50:33] <velemi> They didn't tho
[2:50:34] <SulfurousAcid> they did lightning
[2:50:35] <%badchoice5> Is THIS Sen's Fortress?
[2:50:36] <eco419> Purple Again
[2:50:38] <Mr_Strut> The snake men never had fire breath
[2:50:40] <+eldritchbee> Theyre from sens fortress bcs this is sens fortress
[2:50:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ...pat?
[2:50:44] <cizal11> @barretzm a ring makes explicit mention of snakes and dragons being related
[2:50:44] <+sundizzle> ok pat
[2:50:45] <eco419> shhhhh
[2:50:45] <Inebriateddonut> Crazy Talk's a helluva drug
[2:50:45] <RetributionP> they did lightning pat
[2:50:46] <B_ikki> you're right pat, now that you mention the fire i see
[2:50:47] <katocrimson> They drop an item that indicates they are the snake race
[2:50:47] <%KessOrangeSoda> it's almost like cold-blooded creatures are susceptible to cold damage
[2:50:47] <%Gogogolem> I think nameless king id weak to frost weapons
[2:50:48] <+joylent_blue> pat please
[2:50:50] <NiftyNox> Lighting evolves into Fire Kappa
[2:50:51] <troxcree> I remember them throwing lightning and having 4 arms.
[2:50:55] <%deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf Man, what a tragedy what happened to obsidian. I dunno if their deal with microsoft will improve their stuff
[2:50:55] <Coystick> Man serpents are more Dragon fanboys
[2:50:57] <%ssjklyco> These are dragon people as well
[2:50:57] <%captainthunderwolf> @Freelance_Astronaut Yeah.
[2:51:00] <cizal11> these are definitely at least related to sen's fortress snakemen
[2:51:05] <MettleWolf> I wish Sen's Fortress looked like this.
[2:51:07] <+king_wragles> Like, I've never seen DLC have double weakness to a single weapon from its base game. It's kinda nuts.
[2:51:07] <B_ikki> i wasnt convinced until you reminded me of the fire breathing but now i see the truth
[2:51:08] <Kalcom> 4 arm into 2
[2:51:09] <%forevern2dust> can fire only be used by dragons? or can drakes use it too?
[2:51:10] <DracaenaLeaf> npc I thought
[2:51:11] <%Zundelle> lightning is just higher tier fire
[2:51:14] <+joylent_blue> probably
[2:51:15] <katocrimson> nameless king fight
[2:51:15] <succ699> PAT WRONG AGAIN TO NO ONES SURPRISE
[2:51:15] <$RubberFistFight> rubber16Bon
[2:51:16] <eco419> dont believe his lies
[2:51:17] <+trekkie11041> yup player controlled
[2:51:17] <RetributionP> You are wrong on multiple levels just like colors. Again.
[2:51:22] <%TaifuDragon> It's when someone rings the bell
[2:51:24] <0Roman> it rings any time someone rings the boss bell right
[2:51:24] <@JustinianKnight> people ringing it
[2:51:24] <%Baesel20xx> means someone beat nameless king right?
[2:51:25] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[2:51:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 51m 27s.
[2:51:26] <dekkitout> @Zundelle avatar taught me that
[2:51:26] <+Dao_Puppy> Just like sen's fortress. Because why do something new.
[2:51:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @NiftyNox Didn't you watch Avatar? Lightning evolves from fire
[2:51:28] <$Piemono> Every time it rings, a fat armored man gets his wings
[2:51:32] <+safetycat1> plunging attack
[2:51:35] <NiftyNox> FUCK YOURE RIGHT im a fool
[2:51:35] <Kalcom> bell is someone doing king
[2:51:35] <+sundizzle> huh i never realized that
[2:51:36] <%Nobrev> it dings when someone clears the fog i think
[2:51:36] <0Roman> lmao
[2:51:37] <%captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 Well, definitely, Microsoft buying a studio and doing good work with them is quite... RARE. Hahaha, I hate this and everything that's happened.
[2:51:38] <%TaifuDragon> Not that they beat it, just t hat they pulled it
[2:51:42] <%SolitudeOtM> in this instance Chat is Crazy, these are 100% the serpent men. Not the exact same but they're definitely Serpent men
[2:51:43] <%TorpeAlex> It's a cool callback to the two bells from DS1, I dig ti quite a bit.
[2:51:45] <MettleWolf> Big Snek
[2:51:46] <+joylent_blue> LUL
[2:51:53] <+barretzm> @cizal11 related doesn't mean same. Turtles are related to snakes, Bears are related to seals. They are still different
[2:52:01] <SpinnySpinda> hi errybooooddyyyy
[2:52:02] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat What does frostbite do exactly?
[2:52:03] <$RubberFistFight> Actually @succ699 I gotta defend Pat on this one, most people are of the opinion that these guys are the same kind of Snekmen that you find in Sens
[2:52:03] <eco419> i like that there is a hacker boss fight here
[2:52:04] <+Maids4lyfe> so is this a Vordt's hammer run or something?
[2:52:05] <$RubberFistFight> they're just here
[2:52:05] <NiftyNox> Man Serpent Sword was so fucking good and stylish
[2:52:09] <Inebriateddonut> These Snakemen saw the Dragon form and went "ya know what fuck that snakes are good enough"
[2:52:09] <B_ikki> coolest lamest boss fight coming up
[2:52:13] <%captainthunderwolf> These are definitely Snake Men, their heads and necks are snakes and Dark Souls does nothing but recycle its own ideas.
[2:52:16] <$RubberFistFight> because there's more Snekmens in the world than just the ones in Sens
[2:52:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @Maids4lyfe yep
[2:52:16] <0Roman> bears better fuckin not be related to seals
[2:52:20] <Kalcom> they aren't sneks tho
[2:52:21] <%deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf In another timeline we had Fallout new Orleans after new vegas. I'll light a candle for us
[2:52:21] <+Maids4lyfe> thanks
[2:52:24] <Kalcom> they are dargons
[2:52:25] <%captainthunderwolf> Even if these Snakes are only related, they're functionally the same.
[2:52:26] <cizal11> @barretzm there's no way ds3 would explicitly tie them together if it wasn't meant to be obvious upon reading what the deal is
[2:52:27] <MettleWolf> @AngriestPat First try Nameless King?
[2:52:28] <+SPplayer> I've damage killed this dragon before, it's not worth it. AND you get teleported anyway
[2:52:33] <RetributionP> I want yhorms great axe
[2:52:38] <%KessOrangeSoda> this counts as a boss
[2:52:39] <@JustinianKnight> sorta
[2:52:39] <velemi> Yeah
[2:52:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> kinda yah
[2:52:40] <zamzoph> Yes
[2:52:41] <+Higgsworth> Yes
[2:52:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hmm
[2:52:42] <eco419> no
[2:52:42] <B_ikki> eh
[2:52:42] <+Maids4lyfe> yes it's a boss
[2:52:42] <yukichocomilk> yea
[2:52:42] <%deviljhojho94> I suposse
[2:52:42] <+gael_jebidibah> It has a life bar
[2:52:43] <NiftyNox> Does bed of Chaos?
[2:52:43] <Caidezes> Yes.
[2:52:43] <st_jimmy456> it has a boss life bar
[2:52:45] <alwayspronking> Gimmick, but so i guess
[2:52:46] <ape_hawk> it counts as a puzzle
[2:52:47] <B_ikki> it has a life bar
[2:52:47] <%AncelDeLambert> yes, it's a trick boss, but yeah
[2:52:47] <Intolerable> MY CAR NEEDS A NEW LIGHTNING CLUTCH
[2:52:47] <%badchoice5> OMG DID SEN TURN INTO A WYVERN?!?!
[2:52:48] <+Maids4lyfe> it has a life bar, it's a boss
[2:52:48] <+joylent_blue> i guess
[2:52:49] <%Verd_254> gimmick boss
[2:52:50] <troxcree> It's more of a set piece.
[2:52:50] <%forevern2dust> is this anor londo?
[2:52:50] <%Tearonex> more of a set piece
[2:52:50] <dekkitout> dunno, does ceaseless count?
[2:52:50] <+Floafer> its def a boss, a puzzle boss but a boss
[2:52:52] <%KessOrangeSoda> it's the worst boss, but it's still a boss.
[2:52:53] <+risenlp2> I just want serpent people based off the arabian sand boa.
[2:52:53] <pentagrahams> i believe you used the term event boss before
[2:52:54] <%HiroTSK5> the stage counts as a boss

[2:56:12] <Kalcom> it's a snek
[2:56:14] <%captainthunderwolf> I will say this: If you see this boss as the final evolution of the Obstacle Dragon, where you actually fight and kill the Dragon breathing fire and shit all over your path, then conceptually, that is actually a good conclusion to that idea.

[2:57:44] <+vinadir> real talk when my 14 year old dog “falls asleep” i have a mild panic and check for breathing

[2:57:49] <%Bane_Kaikyo> A Q U I R E C H U N K
[2:57:53] <%HiroTSK5> You wake Elmo up and he just claws the words "Baby Stand" into your arm

[2:57:59] <pentagrahams> become chunk
[2:58:01] <yendoria> @Faustgesicht i think that its a buffering issue
[2:58:05] <%captainthunderwolf> Hey guys, do the Snake Men tie each other's necks and heads up in rags like that? They have to, right? Their arms are too short for them to do it to themselves.
[2:58:08] <MettleWolf> Does this count as a single boss? Or is this the royal snake authority?
[2:58:09] <pentagrahams> dark souls: become chunk
[2:58:17] <%captainthunderwolf> They must stand in a circle wrapping each other with rags to weird people out.
[2:58:18] <%Faustgesicht> yep, fixed
[2:58:20] <%badchoice5> SEN SEES YOU MOTHERFUCKER
[2:58:21] <+king_wragles> @vinadir old dogs sleeping super hard is probably the biggest IRL jump scare

[3:02:53] <+NickyDynamite> So how huge is pat now? He seems bulky
[3:02:57] <%deviljhojho94> Pat has played dark souls 3 before there was a huge shitstorm about BECOMING HUGE
[3:03:02] <%Nobrev> I remember reading somewhere goofy is a steer, not a dog

[3:03:41] <cizal11> big poise
[3:03:42] <+HellCopter> Did they fix poise in this game? Wasn't that a huge problem?
[3:03:42] <%captainthunderwolf> Hey guys, did you know that Betty Boop is literally a dog?
[3:03:45] <MettleWolf> Auto-locked almost as hard as DS1
[3:03:48] <%captainthunderwolf> Like she's a dog? Like really a dog.

[3:04:11] <%Nobrev> early cartoon animation was a lawless wasteland
[3:04:13] <yendoria> I CLAPPED WHEN YOU GOT IT FIRST TRY
[3:04:14] <MettleWolf> Plague Bait
[3:04:15] <Josef_Stryker> What did Pat grab?
[3:04:15] <%Faustgesicht> whad he get? medicant's?
[3:04:15] <%Floafer> at least it wasn't as bad as when woolie got every good drop in DS1
[3:04:16] <themagic_conch> big soul farm time

[3:04:25] <Intolerable> GET WHAT, PAT??
[3:04:26] <%furtivestinbro> DID YOU GET THAY FUCKIN STAFF ON THE FIRST TRY?
[3:04:28] <+joylent_blue> oh a staff
[3:04:28] <%deviljhojho94> Plague bait can be confusing
[3:04:29] <eco419> ring
[3:04:30] <+trekkie11041> that staff god dammit sbfpRage
[3:04:30] <B_ikki> calamity or you're a bitch

[3:04:37] <%badchoice5> WEAR THE RING YOU WONT YOU COWARD
[3:04:37] <%AncelDeLambert> whatever, get spear
[3:04:39] <0Roman> oh nevermind
[3:04:46] <MettleWolf> Go get the useless ring
[3:04:51] <+barretzm> At least everything is infinitely farmable in ds3
[3:04:55] <%captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 Her first appearance, she was not only a dog, but she was dating a competitor to Mickey Mouse at the time. Her design got more humanoid as she got sexed up over time, but there's also a direct timeline in her story.
[3:04:56] <NiftyNox> plus you can trade it for I belive its the Sunlight Shield
[3:04:57] <+SlappyMeats> box face
[3:04:59] <+Freelance_Astronaut> So you can cheat faster
[3:05:03] <B_ikki> WEAR IT PUSSY
[3:05:04] <Josef_Stryker> HOORAY THE MOST USELESS RING IN THE GAME
[3:05:05] <%imextremelymanly> equip the ring you coward
[3:05:07] <%badchoice5> WEAR THE CALAMITY RING YOU COWARD
[3:05:08] <NiftyNox> Wear it for the rest of the run
[3:05:10] <+joylent_blue> THATS WHERE YOU GET THAT?
[3:05:10] <%captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 She's a fucking dog. That's why her head is shaped like a marshmallow.
[3:05:11] <eco419> :D
[3:05:12] <Warbot40> Well Rohan's dub voice wasn't quite what I expected.
[3:05:12] <Clyderso> EASY MODE IS NOW NOT SELECTABLE
[3:05:13] <pentagrahams> PUT IT ON
[3:05:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> And the mimic head
[3:05:17] <MettleWolf> Best ring for fucking psychopaths
[3:05:20] <%deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf This can't be happening
[3:05:23] <TsunTsuchinoko> wear the ring for Nameless, he deserves it
[3:05:23] <@SSaryn> Hey you know what's a good idea? Not putting the Calamity ring on.
[3:05:23] <eco419> ood staff
[3:05:23] <+joylent_blue> HARD MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[3:05:25] <%deviljhojho94> I am a retroactive furry now
[3:05:26] <%AncelDeLambert> yeyeyeye big spear
[3:05:32] <+risenlp2> more like Boring-Stein
[3:05:32] <+SlappyMeats> yeye, but the box head on
[3:05:37] <dekkitout> rohan looks like todd haberkorn would voice him
[3:05:39] <%captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 Seeding those furries early on. This was always the plan.
[3:05:39] <%badchoice5> THE CALAMITY RING IS FOR HEROES
[3:05:41] <NiftyNox> That was goody
[3:05:43] <%furtivestinbro> it also gets you Solaire's shield from the crows.
[3:05:44] <+sundizzle> ornstein was an illusion in anor londo the whole time
[3:05:49] <cizal11> wow
[3:05:51] <B_ikki> what are you talking about
[3:05:52] <velemi> they're not snakes tho
[3:05:53] <+yourunclesmorningpaper> They were buds
[3:05:55] <pentagrahams> they were lovers
[3:05:57] <Kalcom> clearly
[3:05:57] <RCtiger0> Is it me or do i see stutters from time to time?
[3:05:57] <mercado94> Orstein shit in this place
[3:05:57] <eco419> sneks
[3:06:03] <nepwar> what we do know is that goofy fucks
[3:06:03] <+SlappyMeats> sneks like shotels cuz it looks like their dicks, just like people use straight swords
[3:06:04] <+trekkie11041> they used greatswords and flamberges
[3:06:06] <%violetheart> Couldn't have killed Ornstein here since he makes it all the way to the Ringed City.
[3:06:07] <+king_wragles> .... guys, he's actually convincing me a bit.
[3:06:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> snek
[3:06:08] <%badchoice5> No Hammer Snek
[3:06:11] <%captainthunderwolf> Obviously that were Wyvern-Pygmies, Pat.
[3:06:12] <+gael_jebidibah> Time for head
[3:06:12] <%deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf They FUCKED US. Insight GAINED
[3:06:14] <%captainthunderwolf> *they were
[3:06:16] <pentagrahams> ornstein fucks
[3:06:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> The power of Snek boys flows through you
[3:06:22] <legoaisu> It's Eye-Canon, Pat
[3:06:22] <$Metal_Slime_King> Why aren't you playing Red Dead 2 Online and grinding for hours to get enough money to buy a single can of beans.
[3:06:27] <eco419> yup
[3:06:32] <MettleWolf> Wear the Calamity Ring and Rusted Iron Ring at the same time.
[3:06:33] <Inebriateddonut> You go back to the consumed gardens for drakeblood armor
[3:06:33] <+king_wragles> FASHION SOULS TIME
[3:06:34] <0Roman> fuckin sunlight boi is a giant worm
[3:06:34] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Drake blood is back at where you got the emote
[3:06:34] <benjiFG> it's after oceiros' bonfire
[3:06:41] <eggsnbakefest> @AngriestPat I've heard tell that the Nameless King's name was Faraam, since that's the only name of a god of war that we get in this.
[3:06:41] <cizal11> oh geez the red dead online minibuys sound real bad
[3:06:47] <nepwar> orenstien and smough were a power couple, its why smough didnt eat him
[3:06:52] <@SSaryn> @cizal11 TELL ME HOW BAD
[3:06:56] <eco419> yes
[3:06:57] <%badchoice5> Papa Snek and Babby Snek
[3:06:57] <@SSaryn> I WANNA KNOW THE FILTH
[3:07:00] <Warbot40> Like Rohan's dub voice works for his first appearance as a villain but once he actually joins the group it...kinda doesn't fit. We'll see I guess.
[3:07:00] <%captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 "Insight gained" is a great line for when you learn something fucked up, I'm keeping that one in mind.
[3:07:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> The size of this lad
[3:07:01] <ravnica42> B-but the snek’s in the fortress had cobur hoods
[3:07:02] <mercado94> @metal_slime_king did that shit came out or is it still on beta?
[3:07:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Would you rather have more Clothing options or stylin poses?
[3:07:09] <RCtiger0> Oh yeah Jim talked about RDO today
[3:07:10] <eco419> in the room with emote
[3:07:11] <dekkitout> "minibuy" thats a new one, and its going in the lexicon
[3:07:11] <%imextremelymanly> you don't play your best in this game if you are not stylish
[3:07:12] <+eldritchbee> It only shows up NOW
[3:07:12] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat You have to kill a drakeblood for it to spawn
[3:07:15] <%hawk_rush> now it should appear
[3:07:16] <Inebriateddonut> You get it after killing a drake knight once
[3:07:16] <benjiFG> it spawns when you beat drakeblood knight
[3:07:19] <%deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf Plenty of use for it these days
[3:07:21] <+SPplayer> th armor set spawns after you kill the summon of the knight here
[3:07:23] <%captainthunderwolf> @cizal11 Well, that's Rockstar.
[3:07:23] <RetributionP> it shows up after here
[3:07:25] <eco419> you need to open this first
[3:07:25] <yendoria> It's in the room if you've killed a drakeblood knight
[3:07:26] <+Mr_Jumbles> Pat misses something?! WutFace
[3:07:31] <Ravendusk> It should be where you get the drake gesture
[3:07:37] <%RNGsusDied4Wins> @Breakfast_Megapowers clothing
[3:07:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SSaryn Gold alowes you to buy honor or get weapons and horses early
[3:07:42] <$Metal_Slime_King> Still beta, but economy in rdr2 online is mega grindy, they want you to buy gold
[3:07:43] <%Gogogolem> I can help with you dying if i could invade yOU!
[3:07:47] <Futurecity10> Drakeblood armour only spawns after killing 1 drakeblood knight
[3:07:51] <mercado94> i see
[3:07:53] <Xiangchang> Once you kill Havel here, you can go pick up his armor set where you killed the Stray Demon at the Wolf of Farron bonfire and on top of the bridge.
[3:08:00] <MettleWolf> I love how the bell sounds tells you how many people want to fight the true nightmare of this game.
[3:08:03] <@SSaryn> GREAT
[3:08:03] <eco419> go up ring
[3:08:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> it takes 8 hours of raw grinding to get one gold bar @SSaryn
[3:08:08] <+sundizzle> you can come a lot earlier though
[3:08:09] <nepwar> glad to see red dead online following the gta online tradition of no fun allowed unless you cheat or pay up
[3:08:10] <@SSaryn> FUCKING AWESOME
[3:08:11] <0Roman> you can do this part of the game very early
[3:08:12] <%AbnormalVoid> It has SHIIIIIT range, though
[3:08:12] <0Roman> its not hard
[3:08:14] <Josef_Stryker> Doesn't the 3-way split damage make it suck?
[3:08:17] <cizal11> @SSaryn the "premium" currency is gold bars. you can earn them in game, but apparently it takes hours and hours to get just one, and things cost hundreds of them
[3:08:23] <+timblenaut> praise the praise the great great sword
[3:08:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SSaryn it also is used to buy honor
[3:08:25] <%captainthunderwolf> What I'd like is to see the entire gamer community slowly come to hate the industry so greatly that they actively coerce publishers to stop acting like such utter assholes.
[3:08:28] <%TorpeAlex> @doc_ock_rokc just like in real life!
[3:08:33] <IShadowStrykerI> @Josef_Stryker Nope
[3:08:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> squish
[3:08:39] <RetributionP> you can get here super early
[3:08:42] <%captainthunderwolf> You know, like we already should.
[3:08:46] <+gael_jebidibah> The cutest enemies
[3:08:46] <+Zombiemowlcher> Surprised Pat hasn't been invaded here yet
[3:08:48] <Sadolerlaqzarret> The average consumer is a moron so nothing will change
[3:08:53] <%crimsonharvest> i hate htis part
[3:08:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SSaryn and you need honor to get some missions or to be dishonorable to get other missions
[3:08:55] <%captainthunderwolf> Corporations are slaves, make them work to please you.
[3:08:56] <eco419> is a hallway pat
[3:08:56] <st_jimmy456> "i love this area" - almost forgot about it
[3:08:57] <%crimsonharvest> these lizards suck
[3:08:58] <$Metal_Slime_King> There are MANY things in red dead online that cost dozens of gold, you could never grind enough gold even if you played it 16 hours a day
[3:08:59] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Except for these fuckers
[3:09:01] <MettleWolf> rollie pollies
[3:09:03] <katocrimson> oh look a pokemon
[3:09:06] <sodium_station> these stupid assholes
[3:09:09] <B_ikki> this guys are cute
[3:09:10] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate these sonic the hedghorg fucks
[3:09:10] <juxtest> And then theres these guys
[3:09:11] <cizal11> @SSaryn also even getting regular in game money, which is just cash, is also super fucking slow. like you loot a body of an enemy and get fuckin 27 cents
[3:09:11] <+king_wragles> man fights rock, rocks gets in a few good hits
[3:09:11] <%captainthunderwolf> Man, I wanna hug these stupid Crystal Lizards.
[3:09:17] <dekkitout> da blunt damage ResidentSleeper
[3:09:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> 420 Damage
[3:09:19] <themagic_conch> these guys are dicks

[3:09:19] <0Roman> they are so cute dude
[3:09:19] <AllJoeShow> high damage to blunts?
[3:09:20] <%AbnormalVoid> vineAlien Blunt Damage
[3:09:23] <%deviljhojho94> Throw a pokeball at him
[3:09:24] <%captainthunderwolf> These things look like they evolve into Aggron.
[3:09:24] <Josef_Stryker> Keep rolling rolling rolling rolling
[3:09:25] <B_ikki> they're like little rock bulbasaurs
[3:09:25] <%AncelDeLambert> GET KNOCKED OFF THE CLIFF
[3:09:26] <0Roman> when they jump they stick their legs out and belly flop
[3:09:29] <MettleWolf> why would you cut stone?
[3:09:29] <+Mr_Jumbles> BLUNT DAMAGE 420!
[3:09:29] <@SSaryn> I'm honestly glad I didn't like RDR2 to begin with now.
[3:09:29] <%deviljhojho94> See if he has good IVs
[3:09:30] <+joylent_blue> URAGAAN GONNA FUCK YOU UP
[3:09:31] <%AncelDeLambert> FALL ASSHOLE!
[3:09:31] <NiftyNox> Finally, Pat is rewarded for his overwhelming bluntness Kappa

[3:28:06] <+Bt_Robot> That isn't really Havel, the item description says that a cult of Havel started after his death at the hands of the Chosen Undead. Basically he is a player that went big poise and hollowed out.

[3:28:52] <%captainthunderwolf> @doc_ock_rokc That's also pretty good.

[3:29:02] <Josef_Stryker> @AngriestPat If u haven't already, look for Hawkwood's Summon Sign
[3:29:02] <+AXL808> And so we mourn the loss of Havel the Rock, murdered by Shitlord Patrick
[3:29:06] <ArgusStrav> @king_wragles This is a secret area which is entirely optional; in order to unlock it you have to find a specific gesture and then use it at a different location pointed towards this zone
[3:29:09] <B_ikki> for the l o r e
[3:29:11] <MettleWolf> This is the other boss fight
[3:29:15] <AllJoeShow> havel will just wake at a bonfire
[3:29:15] <+Ssaik> I see it
[3:29:16] <DuoScratch> So you're gonna summon Hawkwood @AngriestPat ? That seems to be the legit way to do it...or at least the canon way.
[3:29:23] <%AncelDeLambert> GET REKT LOSER!
[3:29:26] <ArtThouBored> No way
[3:29:28] <katocrimson> except they don't give you frenzy

[3:29:39] <+Ssaik> Man the animations in this game are top quality
[3:29:39] <Inebriateddonut> BIG COWARDICE
[3:29:41] <%captainthunderwolf> I mean, design-wise, these guys are clearly the Beasts from Old Yharnam in Bloodborne.
[3:29:42] <ArtThouBored> The bell buff was crazy
[3:29:45] <%badchoice5> Havel could do this run legit, no Estus
[3:29:45] <dekkitout> and they dont shoot space magic at you
[3:29:50] <%captainthunderwolf> The ones that fucker with the Gatling Gun protects.
[3:29:51] <@JustinianKnight> this isn't DLC, just extra area
[3:29:52] <$RubberFistFight> BOIVIN COWARD POWERS ACTIVATE
[3:29:59] <ArgusStrav> @king_wragles It's not DLC; it was included in the base game.

[3:30:20] <%AncelDeLambert> might as well, this is his side quest
[3:30:22] <+sundizzle> this is base game, but it always felt like DLC which is cool
[3:30:25] <@JustinianKnight> cheese em
[3:30:29] <%badchoice5> Havel could take em
[3:30:31] <eco419> So manny

[3:30:34] <eggsnbakefest> @AngriestPat there was a summon sign back there
[3:30:35] <%captainthunderwolf> It's like you invaded the HOME, Patg.
[3:30:38] <MettleWolf> They could have easily cut this area and made it DLC, but they didn't like heroes
[3:30:42] <%captainthunderwolf> It's like you BROKE INTO THEIR HOUSE.
[3:30:42] <pentagrahams> havel will be avenged
[3:30:43] <+Grimlockfly> Git gud
[3:30:52] <%captainthunderwolf> It's like you CHOSE TO INVADE THEIR SETTLEMENT.

[3:35:15] <xBolts4Lifex> great start LUL
[3:35:15] <Make_me_mad> Look at this goddamn final fantasy boss.
[3:35:17] <%hawk_rush> best boss in ds3
[3:35:18] <mojokingizakku> a storm is coming
[3:35:20] <pentagrahams> i'm thinking 5 to 10
[3:35:22] <Xiangchang> Camera is the real boss.
[3:35:23] <%captainthunderwolf> @eggsnbakefest Nameless is proper nameless, I believe. Faraam is probably the hubby.
[3:35:24] <sodium_station> bird... dragon thing
[3:35:25] <yukichocomilk> KING OF THE STORM
[3:35:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> THE DAMAGE
[3:35:29] <Caidezes> DON'T LOCK ON
[3:35:29] <%OdysseyKnight> Remember when first fighting him you thought he was the king of the storm
[3:35:29] <Kalcom> but what if ornstein became dargon
[3:35:31] <DuoScratch> He needs to use the 1 hand mode for the overhead hit to the dragon.
[3:35:32] <0Roman> oh fuck its gonna b 3
[3:35:33] <eggsnbakefest> That
[3:35:34] <mojokingizakku> ZUBAZ

[3:44:02] <pentagrahams> @imextremelymanly Smough actually was in Anor Londo, Ornstein was an illusion and left to find the nameless king
[3:44:05] <%Piemen99> what happens if you kill the level up chick?
[3:44:06] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Foolishness Patrick. Foolishness.

[3:44:51] <wsintai> "easily"
[3:44:56] <B_ikki> "he" is doing it
[3:44:57] <Aji__> Before i read into the lore, i thought the nameless king turned ornstein into the king of the storm
[3:44:58] <CaptainKarite> D:
[3:44:59] <eggsnbakefest> But it's cooooooooooool

[3:45:10] <%badchoice5> "Since I cowarded out of Nameless King, let's go do some more of the Ice Level"
[3:45:14] <Bouldus> it has the normal halberd moveset which is average
[3:45:19] <katocrimson> WELCOME TO SKYRIM
[3:45:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Best weapon is the IMMOLATION TINDER
[3:45:25] <tremerss> the best large weapon is the cathedral greatsword because its a sword that does strike damage LUL
[3:45:27] <%Tredecian> its only some of them
[3:45:29] <NiftyNox> You're finally awake
[3:45:30] <pentagrahams> can't wait for the summons against Friede

[3:47:00] <alcors_wisdom> leory jefthro gibbs
[3:47:00] <pentagrahams> @imextremelymanly yeah it's one of my favorite bits of lore, I believe the description of Smough's armor in this says something to the effect of he was the last one guarding the abandoned cathedral of Anor Londo
[3:47:01] <sodium_station> nameless king kicked his ass round 1, then pat got a squad to help him
[3:47:03] <+moranprime> @burna_lova Nameless King got gank spanked by Solaire and Momba No. 9 while Pat cheered on Kappa
[3:47:06] <%badchoice5> Scum him out he deserves it
[3:47:07] <+Tokanova> i hope gibbs goes full stealth mode on pat lol
[3:47:15] <burna_lova> Good man.
[3:47:20] <0Roman> lol
[3:47:25] <+moranprime> Gibbs is making a snowman
[3:47:28] <%AlasterAngelo> hack Pat and delete his pants
[3:47:29] <%badchoice5> Pat barely even hit the Nameless King, just had two summons do it all
[3:47:30] <MettleWolf> Imagine if you can mimic a bonfire?
[3:47:32] <majindusto> Pat got carried, HARD!!!
[3:47:33] <yendoria> I don't think that Gibbz can even get to him right now
[3:47:37] <RetributionP> Nb4 pat pulls the cord Kappa
[3:47:41] <+vinadir> get stream sniped
[3:47:42] <Aji__> I personally think that the dlc dragon is harder than the nameless king
[3:47:45] <%imextremelymanly> @pentagrahams a knight to the very end huh
[3:47:56] <Coystick> The only flaw in this level is the second boss
[3:48:00] <%ssjklyco> He spawned in just so you can't use a bon fire. The best troll
[3:48:00] <Coystick> love it
[3:48:02] <%imextremelymanly> gibbz waiting for the ambush
[3:48:09] <B_ikki> you did it
[3:48:10] <sodium_station> this dlc's final boss fucking sucks
[3:48:12] <pentagrahams> @imextremelymanly he at least tried to be, a knight in all but title
[3:48:15] <+vinadir> the only flaw in this level is the level
[3:48:21] <MettleWolf> He's with the pupper squad
[3:48:22] <Coystick> @sodium_station you crazy
[3:48:24] <@thenefftw> I hope he's waiting by the dogs
[3:48:25] <%badchoice5> SCUM HIM OUT GIBBZ
[3:48:25] <sodium_station> "if you picked a strength build, go fuck yourself" this DLC boss in a nutshell

[3:52:53] <0Roman> someone get in this world with a claymore
[3:52:53] <wsintai> I'd fuck the trees
[3:52:55] <NiftyNox> When this DLC came out I was actually really hoping there was gonna be a covenant or something that would let you turn into one of those fly people
[3:52:55] <%patriotrenegade> its not a great enemy
[3:52:58] <eco419> owo
[3:53:04] <+king_wragles> Hey @AngriestPat ... light on fire for old times sake.
[3:53:06] <alcors_wisdom> should have brought an axe
[3:53:09] <%Remery_> Can a Tree Women get gregnant?
[3:53:10] <+Higgsworth> Tree Bitches have such a cool design
[3:53:11] <RetributionP> pat needs to be put in his place
[3:53:12] <+creamandsugar> The Bork-down is real

[3:53:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 53m 17s.
[3:53:19] <FourLeafLover> Pop Dried Finger Kappa
[3:53:21] <%MrBorisMakarov> this is a mess
[3:53:21] <+king_wragles> ... they scream louder when ablaze right?
[3:53:23] <pentagrahams> invade him with a ricard cosplay
[3:53:23] <dekkitout> pretty sure they can via pollination or something
[3:53:24] <General_Terro> snuff that pup
[3:53:30] <alwayspronking> bust those borks
[3:53:31] <MettleWolf> Can you put fire resin on this weapon?
[3:53:34] <+vinadir> those tree ladies make the same sound I did when Gibbz died
[3:53:36] <+jorgamund> whaaa you have something against puking albino tree banshees?
[3:53:39] <itsya_boi_gappy> banging a tree must not fee l great tho chat
[3:53:44] <Claxxi> this is my favorite lgbt stream
[3:53:44] <NiftyNox> Very true
[3:53:57] <+mar2503> you can get to it too early to get chunks
[3:54:01] <%shabop> there are chunks
[3:54:06] <burna_lova> I think there are some chunks later on in the area.
[3:54:07] <%thunderdutch> I don't think trees can get prognizant
[3:54:07] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Don't tell me what not to bang
[3:54:10] <alcors_wisdom> @itsya_boi_gappy that sounds like coward talk to me
[3:54:11] <cizal11> probably because you can access it right as you enter the cathedral
[3:54:11] <+SlappyMeats> I hope I never have to bang a tree, knock on wood
[3:54:13] <+SlappyMeats> dammit
[3:54:16] <katocrimson> the tree bitches actually have a bit of ass
[3:54:18] <+Bt_Robot> Pat not gonna fight Big doggo?
[3:54:18] <%shabop> i just picked one up here
[3:54:26] <wolfen091> ugh fly ppl
[3:54:28] <%patriotrenegade> Out of all the Souls series DLCs, this is the weakest. @AngriestPat Even Crown of the Old Iron King
[3:54:35] <danknugglit> This is the pretty and gross area at the same time
[3:54:37] <%RedMaskBandit> well it's an area that can be accessed during cathedral of the deep
[3:54:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> they ded pat
[3:54:38] <NiftyNox> Love them fly guys
[3:54:38] <Coystick> Pontiff Sullyvanh's people
[3:54:42] <+king_wragles> if she breathes, SHE IS A TREE
[3:54:45] <danknugglit> Most
[3:54:49] <RetributionP> yea you could get +9 super early if some of these enemies dropped chucks
[3:54:53] <%Rngiddion> can't be a tree bitch full time you gotta start part time
[3:54:54] <sodium_station> i gotta tell ya those trees having thighs are giving me weird thoughts
[3:54:56] <%laserbeaming> Yo Pat, still streaming?
[3:54:58] <itsya_boi_gappy> BibleThump you guys are right im being a wuss time to nut up
[3:55:02] <B_ikki> nah hes not crazy
[3:55:16] <velemi> Iron King is waaay better than Sunken City
[3:55:16] <%crimsonharvest> son of a bitch i stood up to pee and kicked the fuck out of a chair leg with my bare foot
[3:55:18] <B_ikki> only good thing on this dlc is freida
[3:55:20] <RetributionP> because you are a weak piss baby
[3:55:21] <Kalcom> i like bitch snow
[3:55:25] <+AXL808> those flies would be horrible if they were real, instead of landing on your food they'd take it from you
[3:55:28] <Coystick> Whaaaat all the crowns rock
[3:55:29] <+imporia_> crown of the iron king was my favorite of the ds2 dlcs
[3:55:31] <+Dao_Puppy> I'm really confused by what I just heard.
[3:55:34] <NiftyNox> Sunken City is great
[3:55:39] <alcors_wisdom> @itsya_boi_gappy its not called Destroy Dick December for nothing
[3:55:40] <%laserbeaming> I don't like any of the DS3 DLCs
[3:55:41] <NiftyNox> Ivory king SUCKETH
[3:55:41] <+king_wragles> @crimsonharvest did you pee on the chair for revenge?
[3:55:46] <katocrimson> Miyazaki:"You like fan-service"
[3:55:48] <Nazgul240> Did Pat beat the nameless king?
[3:55:51] <%furtivestinbro> I love this dlc I don't get the hate at all.
[3:55:53] <+AXL808> cool corvian knights/assassins
[3:55:55] <%crimsonharvest> @king_wragles sadly the peeing had already ended
[3:55:56] <%patriotrenegade> The Viking guys are cool @AngriestPat
[3:55:56] <B_ikki> the town is fine
[3:55:58] <eco419> no
[3:55:58] <RetributionP> it's annoying
[3:56:03] <nepwar> not mentioning ice city and the ice wilderlands as the worse area ever
[3:56:03] <+Allyofwar> The boss fight against the ivory king himself is one of my favorite bosses in the series
[3:56:04] <MettleWolf> Nah it's all about the gross shit birds
[3:56:09] <Coystick> Should have been in the base game
[3:56:09] <velemi> The only thing bad about Ivory King is the outskirts
[3:56:12] <%MrBorisMakarov> ring city is so fuckin good
[3:56:17] <+Templar15> Ringed City has too many "Run or Die" segments.
[3:56:18] <+TheSaintJohn> I didn't particularly care for DS3 DLC's focus on paintings
[3:56:18] <+AXL808> Japanese, Pat, S
[3:56:22] <+LogothX> At least its not DS2 DLC
[3:56:23] <%MrBorisMakarov> especially SURPRISE BITCH archers
[3:56:32] <+mugwugsampoo> If I havent played the DLC yet, should I stop watching?
[3:56:33] <danknugglit> I like the area but champions gravetender is trash
[3:56:35] <AllJoeShow> naz yes he did, he lamed it out and CALLED PPL IN TO help him HARNESSING HIS TRUE SCRB
[3:56:37] <+Chud_Pudsley> I didn't really care for DS3 @TheSaintJohn
[3:56:37] <+imporia_> this one would be better if it wasn't so short
[3:56:40] <+Noni321> DS2 Unicorns LUL
[3:56:45] <sodium_station> vikings with RPG arrows
[3:56:46] <NiftyNox> The only tihng good about Ivory King was the King boss and the sword you get
[3:56:47] <alcors_wisdom> pat getting hard on stream as per usual
[3:56:48] <danknugglit> Just a half naked npc
[3:56:55] <+Bt_Robot> Gotta fight Sif Junior at least twice if you want to see that item...
[3:56:56] <brambobelurkin> This area feels like something for the Northern armor, and got cut so they just DLC'd it.
[3:56:57] <+TheSaintJohn> @Chud_Pudsley Boom gottem
[3:56:57] <%bobopipe> hahaha

[3:59:10] <pentagrahams> @laserbeaming great idea!
[3:59:11] <Mimpyflip> Why is it when I watch someone play dark souls I think "Wow what a clunky piece of shit" But when i play it im like "This feels better than sex"
[3:59:13] <%patriotrenegade> Its just Watchdog of the Old Lords

[3:59:53] <Coystick> SKYRIMS
[3:59:57] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Are these wolves easier than the ones in Dragons Dogma?
[4:00:01] <%MrBorisMakarov> i love these vikings
[4:00:05] <eco419> fus
[4:00:09] <dekkitout> skyrim boi's wish they were that
[4:00:14] <iwasJase> that antler helm is the best
[4:00:15] <sodium_station> i like how they're canonically just fucking HUGE vikinngs
[4:00:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> stag boi
[4:00:16] <AllJoeShow> dam forsworn
[4:00:16] <pentagrahams> the aesthetic is great
[4:00:17] <+LogothX> That reminds me, how is Elder Scrolls Online these days?
[4:00:24] <sodium_station> like they're huge but not because of any souls shenanigans
[4:00:25] <%furtivestinbro> @mettlewolf yeah playing back through DS Remastered I was shocked at how much larger Sif is than these puppers.
[4:00:26] <zettig> like skyrim with chonk!
[4:00:27] <sodium_station> they're just big bois
[4:00:27] <+AXL808> Ariandel seems like it's the smallest DLC
[4:00:28] <IShadowStrykerI> pat just murdered that guys nuts
[4:00:33] <%patriotrenegade> You'd think they wouldn't be weak to frost
[4:00:34] <pararscs> whats the ar on the mace?
[4:00:41] <dekkitout> not even ulfric can shout them down
[4:00:41] <danknugglit> The micolash doggos are plotting with the skyrimmen
[4:00:46] <Prism_Wing> Old Hunters is like that too, now that I think about it.

[4:13:59] <eco419> u monster
[4:14:04] <%Afterman_> ye i dont think he will either, but the microphone looking thing on his head made me wonder, would be interesting
[4:14:05] <%SolitudeOtM> I was deeply disappointed in Woolie
[4:14:12] <%SolitudeOtM> when he lost to Michael
[4:14:13] <booglesnurf> SoulCalibur fucked up my taste in women

[4:14:17] <%hawk_rush> @RubberFistFight Lmaoooo what a way to go out
[4:14:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> true
[4:14:23] <%forevern2dust> EA has always been shit.
[4:14:25] <ArtThouBored> EA is bad
[4:14:30] <eco419> ditto
[4:14:34] <aiyobro> mass effect multiplayer
[4:14:34] <+DGenerator> Respawn Star WarsÉ

[4:14:35] <Bouldus> yea
[4:14:36] <+Higgsworth> FIFA 20??? Kappa
[4:14:36] <MettleWolf> That's why Anthem is at risk
[4:14:37] <pentagrahams> EA go WAY down
[4:14:37] <%Order_of_Mystery> Not even Anthem?!
[4:14:37] <%kewlmyc> Anthem maybe?
[4:14:41] <%forevern2dust> Titanfall 2 was good.
[4:14:41] <+AXL808> EA is a soul-sucking trash pile
[4:14:41] <+aslfrasle> maybe Anthem?
[4:14:42] <danknugglit> When is woolie going to unlock his borutogan
[4:14:42] <Coystick> Wad aboot FIFA?
[4:14:43] <faegbeard> boycott by default
[4:14:43] <cizal11> @AngriestPat what about anthem LMFAO yeah right
[4:14:45] <ArtThouBored> It killed mass effect and dead space
[4:14:47] <%Chichen> Who gives a fuck about Anthem
[4:14:49] <+DGenerator> Anthem LUL
[4:14:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> EA killed all their own good stuff
[4:14:51] <+king_wragles> Battlefield 5 sounds like it has some interesting moments, but it's probably still meh
[4:14:51] <%cherubsanonymous> Anthem looks like a disaster, we know this
[4:14:57] <%Afterman_> @majindusto ya i tweeted the pic at him, thats what made me go wtfff
[4:14:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Anthem looks like shit
[4:14:58] <Mechazoic_Era> \[T]/

[4:15:00] <eco419> :D
[4:15:01] <$RubberFistFight> @hawk_rush honestly his strategy thus far has been getting in their face and swinging like crazy with Vordt's hammer - his luck had to run out eventually.
[4:15:02] <%SolitudeOtM> EA should remake Mass Effect Andromeda
[4:15:02] <%DONGWAVE> \[T]/ \[T]/
[4:15:04] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Mirrors edge 2, but chances of that are pretty nothing.
[4:15:07] <MettleWolf> Anthem did kill Mass Effect BibleThump
[4:15:07] <aiyobro> battlefieldV has some cool transitions
[4:15:14] <sodium_station> Bioware and EA have somehow made mechas and power suits BORING.
[4:15:14] <pentagrahams> anthem not saving anything
[4:15:27] <sodium_station> A feat I didn't think achievable.
[4:15:31] <eco419> f
[4:15:31] <faegbeard> anthem looks like the poor man's destiny which is the poor man's warframe
[4:15:34] <Chatterbox1991> That is the best!
[4:15:36] <$Salty3acon> Your a cool guy Pat, hope you keep feeding off our shitposting to become even bigger and stronger vohiyo200

[4:15:52] <%TaifuDragon> what was the name?
[4:15:53] <%crimsonharvest> no they wont, nobody's playing it
[4:15:53] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Lost planet is capcom
[4:15:56] <%SolitudeOtM> You see, Anthem is chasing after Destiny, when it should chase after Warframe
