[0:12:33] <%afronooch> probably the same "dad can't do nothing" writers
[0:12:34] <+turnipkupo> oh cmon its not embarassing
[0:12:35] <sophienatorz_unite> pat broke the p****
[0:12:38] <DianaTheAscian> is it the size?
[0:12:42] <%king_wragles> Just ask the clerk for some rubber dick sleeves, that'll make it better
[0:12:42] <Ipsenscastle> Yeah it's the worst
[0:12:48] <+megaotter> it feels like you are doing something not allowed
[0:12:49] <%Rumbutt> Those sitcom writers basically didn't know any women, that's it. That's why.
[0:12:52] <%BinaryFireball> you imagine the clerk imagining you naked
[0:12:53] <VoxelFox51> Oh nO I totally get it
[0:12:54] <AzureGale> Yeah, what if one of the condoms was broken
[0:12:55] <%rdark_ksu> big fun for self checkout
[0:12:56] <%maenos2> i remember being embarrassed because i was apparently buying the "gay" lube (but damn it i love astroglide)
[0:13:00] <bob900000> is it the size?
[0:13:00] <+BallerSwagBro9k> IDK im completely chill buying them
[0:13:01] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> I have never bought condoms at anyplace that doesn't have a self checkout
[0:13:02] <%nmaten> i need a monster condom for my magnum dong
[0:13:03] <%YakumoYomi> Is it a size thing?
[0:13:03] <%bevyrage> buying condoms is being blatant about the size of your penis, and that is embarrassing to tons of men
[0:13:05] <VoxelFox51> havnt boughten them in years and im scared of when ill have to again
[0:13:05] <%SaiyanShoto> The clerks always stare at me
[0:13:06] <%tizz86> then the stores lock them behind glass
[0:13:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Buying condoms makes you look like a Try-Hard, unless you are too horny to be self aware
[0:13:11] <%royb2> And once again, clerks dont care. At best I will think "Lol you think you're getting laid? "
[0:13:13] <%UvBenServed> Cause condoms are for cowards /s
[0:13:19] <%oniwahoo> Yo what if you bought some and the clerk commented on how your D is little
[0:13:23] <%Reevesypoo> I was working at a store and my history teacher came into my checkout lane with 2 packs of magnum condoms I never was the same in his class ever again.
[0:13:23] <%arcielardor> oh good
[0:13:24] <%Broand> "someone can make estimates about the position of my penis in the coming weeks" is a legitimate fear
[0:13:24] <BlkFlameKami> mom: haha ur pussy
[0:13:25] <%Bane_Kaikyo> When ya girl ask you to get tampons, the correct response is "Sure thing honey, what size is yo pussy?"
[0:13:26] <%kobold_wrangler> Too bad you can’t self check out condoms
[0:13:31] <rasamune> You’re buying a penis thing; there is no further thought
[0:13:34] <darklurker_dumahiem> The condom issue: You're Admitting to a stranger...that you're Fucking....
[0:13:34] <+turnipkupo> pat was embarassed theyd laugh at his elephant cock condoms like ippo
[0:13:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> the trick is to buy extra small condoms.
[0:13:46] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> dude if i was asked about buying tampons i'd just say yeah my girl's pussy is bleeding, like a psychopath
[0:13:47] <%Broand> does that count as shitting your pants th
[0:13:49] <+CSNG> "Excuse me, do have anything smaller?"

[0:14:20] <Mr_Strut> Some of us still know shame
[0:14:22] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> The real strat is to sellout your significant other and shit talk them to the clerk

[0:14:57] <darklurker_dumahiem> if only you could stel PLAN B
[0:14:57] <Sotetsu> A flaming asshole is nothing to be ashamed about.
[0:15:00] <jackrulez92> the clerk does care
[0:15:00] <%emperordread> BIG LIE
[0:15:00] <bob900000> some do

[0:15:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BallerSwagBro9k Infected blood vessel in your asshole

[0:21:17] <T_Sasquatch> POTTERE
[0:21:17] <%CrookedSpiral> 3 monkeys in a trench coat
[0:21:18] <BlkFlameKami> the great potato famine
[0:21:19] <%UvBenServed> X POTATO
[0:21:20] <DracaenaLeaf> Ponanas
[0:21:20] <%tizz86> banana potato, same difference
[0:21:21] <+BallerSwagBro9k> BANATATO
[0:21:23] <Fien111> Potatoes are heavy, that probably damaged his car's suspension
[0:21:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Tato is so less funny
[0:21:23] <pokiplayer> you sure this wasn't DSP's Potato wife?
[0:21:25] <%crimsonharvest> cause what the customer actually wants isnt important
[0:21:26] <%SirKeigan> Needs bulk
[0:21:28] <jackrulez92> limmyEcciedL limmyEcciedM limmyEcciedR
[0:21:29] <%Broand> Ah yes the discerning customer "A. Iris Mann"
[0:21:32] <%kobold_wrangler> r o t a t o
[0:21:34] <+tigerfang86> it was EVERY POTATO
[0:21:34] <DianaTheAscian> thats amazing
[0:21:34] <%Profmcstevie> Potatoes match the "we use it in most dishes" than Bananas....but it is less funny
[0:21:34] <T_Sasquatch> Je voudrais poterre !!!
[0:21:35] <+thackattack00> Plantains look like bananas but taste like potatos
[0:21:36] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> I mean thats even worse, grocery stores have WAY more potatoes than bananas
[0:21:37] <$Invlux> I had one of our overseas managers make us throw away every single yellow banana we had
[0:21:37] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt You told this story during Bully I think.
[0:21:38] <%linSP> Not one banato
[0:21:39] <%KishinGrek> not a one
[0:21:39] <%tizz86> Banato
[0:21:41] <%ssjklyco> Arent they technically canadian fries if he made them in canada?
[0:21:42] <%royb2> Problem with that is that the potential reputational harm from not having potatoes for other customers does more harm to you than selling all those potatoes for one guy does good for you.
[0:21:44] <DianaTheAscian> no time for warehouse
[0:21:44] <+ThomasOfTroy> So did the store just not have potatoes for the rest of the day?
[0:21:46] <%SirKeigan> Did you at least put them in boxes?
[0:21:49] <sophienatorz_unite> Ratioed bt potato
[0:21:50] <%emperordread> Watch out Itchy, he's Irish
[0:21:50] <zeif00> tbh that's a HUGE sale

[0:34:56] <%Fooguwu> WERE YOU THO
[0:34:57] <DayDayMaccin1> brownFAIL
[0:34:57] <+canseesea> I figured you were like my gramma, she's gotten shorter since I met her
[0:34:57] <AzureGale> Not rly
[0:34:58] <%Keaton_x> I went from 5'4'' to 5'11'' in 4 months. That shit sucked.
[0:34:58] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt ARE U NOT 3'4???
[0:34:59] <%Broand> I just thought you popped out like that
[0:35:00] <pokiplayer> no I was tall
[0:35:00] <+BallerSwagBro9k> YES
[0:35:00] <%Xevtes> not like you smaller
[0:35:00] <artificiallynatural> no, did you not come out as you currently are?
[0:35:00] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> NO I WAS BORN 2 METERS
[0:35:01] <%Spydurman> no
[0:35:01] <$Invlux> We thought you grew into it, like a dog
[0:35:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> I was 5'2 when I was 5
[0:35:01] <+CookieCutter007> I was born 6 foot tall
[0:35:01] <%SirKeigan> It's a bit

[0:35:03] <%heartlesshealer> Even... 'smaller' Pat? HyperLost HyperLost HyperLost
[0:35:03] <Srthunda> not by choice
[0:35:05] <zeif00> Not shocked, just think it's unfortunate
[0:35:06] <%afronooch> you said significant growth spurt
[0:35:06] <%TonyR2014> pat came out the pussy his current height, it's in the lore
[0:35:06] <%king_wragles> I was smaller as a child, but I grew to a normal size
[0:35:06] <%SaiyanShoto> Kinda, I know a lot of kids who are as tall or taller than you
[0:35:08] <T_Sasquatch> I was 5'5 when I was 10 LUL
[0:35:08] <%SirKeigan> It's a bit that you are already small
[0:35:08] <%Valdorick> Pat is that height, from the Womb to the Tomb
[0:35:08] <%Ne1son> No never
[0:35:10] <BoneofMalkav> No Pat, I was was a 7 foot Baby LUL j/k
[0:35:10] <%scrumbotime> See, that's what hurts, because I got my growth spurt EARLY, so I was Big Tall....... and then didn't grow any/much more all the way through middle/high school. So I was like OH GOD PLEASE STOP GETTING TALLER THAN ME I NEED THIS.
[0:35:10] <%Spydurman> I came out the womb 6ft tall
[0:35:11] <%rdark_ksu> naw I cartwheeled out the birth canal at 5'7
[0:35:11] <Azathotic> No, I tore through my mother like Kool-Aid Man

[0:35:14] <+LynbellDaYo> i came out 5'6", ruined my mom, tell you what
[0:35:16] <+BallerSwagBro9k> WERE U NOT BORN A 35 YEAR OLD MAN?
[0:35:18] <%fakeburg> Pat went from 3' 5" to 3' 13"
[0:35:18] <%YakumoYomi> I'm only 5'7, so...not much smaller

[0:36:24] <%scrumbotime> You could tell me that 2019 was in 2020 and I wouldn't be able to prove you wrong
[0:36:25] <+McSoliace> "what month is it?"

[0:39:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> New Genesis or whatever
[0:39:17] <Aydarkzero> what japanese game doesn't have dante dna in it at this point
[0:39:18] <%Calek> play pso2, get the Nier stuff and transfer it to pso3
[0:39:21] <gustavozxd> that's gonna be a different game tho right?
[0:39:23] <%Laecerelius> Yup! FUCK RESIN
[0:39:24] <%BoxNavy> FUCK RESIN
[0:39:26] <$RealThiele> the good version
[0:39:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> I like Megumin well enough for what it's worth, but she's not my favorite.
[0:39:31] <$RealThiele> SOME
[0:39:33] <AzureGale> Yep, resin system suuuuuucks
[0:39:33] <Skeletonmanners> resin is mostly there until theres more of the game

[0:39:44] <Kongro_> Resin stinky
[0:39:46] <Skeletonmanners> it sucks but it prolly will go away
[0:39:47] <%Daniel_Is_I> Those Genshin problems are inherent to gacha games. It's just weirder because Genshin plays like an actual game.
[0:39:47] <%shurtal> "You will pay attention to ME NOW"
[0:39:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> I have so much resin that the resin system hasn;t been much of an issue. >>

Search Neoseeker Kingmaker Builds to get a directory of good builds for every character. There’s also guides for the kingdom management stuff if you play that far. They worked great for my play through
[0:39:58] <Aydarkzero> is Gief still teething?

[1:21:19] <Malkarii> @Malkarii shes fine unless there's an overwhelming swarm. she can only move so much before her stamina bar runs out
[1:21:21] <$RealThiele> the art gets better too
[1:21:22] <Ipsenscastle> I don't like the tiny pixels personally, it doesn't have the elegance of a hyper light drifter
[1:21:23] <+Regigangster> I can't imagine how much this art must've taken
[1:21:24] <swordmanegill> Pat! Are you gonna do more Baldurs Gate 3?
[1:21:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL
[1:21:36] <T_Sasquatch> I never look at Screenshots of games
[1:22:02] <Ipsenscastle> or Duelyst, that had some gorgeous pixel art
[1:22:03] <%OperatorJo_> Bayleaf: Redux
[1:22:11] <not_twitter_rowan> @Malkarii yeah, the problem comes late in the run when "overwhelming horde" is the only option of enemies
[1:22:12] <Meltgar> SKELETON WARRIORS
[1:22:16] <%rdark_ksu> the bay leaf was origionally called the devil leaf as it formed from concentrated murderous desire
[1:22:17] <$RealThiele> clearly pat hates paige
[1:22:27] <%crimsonharvest> found the spikes good work
[1:22:42] <%Profmcstevie> Warm up those children, we're gonna be down a family member
[1:22:45] <Malkarii> @not_twitter_rowan kevin is my fav for slashing through the hordes
[1:23:05] <WillofGame> Linda is pretty good.
[1:23:05] <Raishiro> man this game's story is so dark
[1:23:12] <not_twitter_rowan> @Malkarii I found him enjoyable. thought the mage girl was the best, along with the monk
[1:23:14] <r0termond> Hello Pat from Pat Stares At
[1:23:20] <WillofGame> especially when exploring new areas.
[1:23:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> is that another chest?
[1:23:23] <$RealThiele> oh, corruption sickness is lame
[1:23:26] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[1:23:26] <Meltgar> Was that a chest?
[1:23:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[1:23:27] <%YakumoYomi> Yes
[1:23:28] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> A little.
[1:23:29] <%Agami23> i can kinda see it
[1:23:29] <Zebroneath> I can see it
[1:23:32] <%MechArch> yeah!
[1:23:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I was going to say @PatStaresAt
[1:23:39] <Malkarii> this is very diablo-esque, yes
[1:23:40] <Saltmeisterr> im not noticing the roguelike elements yet
[1:23:42] <The_Maddness> this room is from Finland?
[1:23:43] <%crimsonharvest> pat Diablo literally is a roguelike in every sense of the basic maeaning
[1:23:45] <$RealThiele> rogue legacy vibes
[1:23:46] <+Regigangster> Yeah, with the mobs. Probably need to die to feel the roguelike
[1:23:53] <%Calliphor> Isn't a Finnish room just a sauna?
[1:23:54] <%MechArch> looks like a den from rouge encampment
[1:23:59] <Sokawaiibebe> My first though was Diablo
[1:23:59] <%Parapattern> This is giving me Risk of Rain x Diablo vibes
[1:24:04] <Malkarii> @Regigangster there will be lots of dying
[1:24:25] <%crimsonharvest> remember diablo was a graphical turn based roguelike at first
[1:24:31] <not_twitter_rowan> YUP
[1:24:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> WELCOME TO MORTA BITCH
[1:24:43] <+Regigangster> @Malkarii Hey, he could go all the way.... maybe.... ok...
[1:24:46] <Sotetsu> Thanks, Bird
[1:24:48] <$RealThiele> WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD
[1:24:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That escalated.
[1:24:51] <Malkarii> LOL
[1:24:54] <%crimsonharvest> alll they did to change it was make the timer tick on its own
[1:24:56] <%Profmcstevie> BIRD OF STRENGTH
[1:25:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Rich man Pat leaving gold behind.
[1:25:10] <not_twitter_rowan> and that is why I really don't like this game LUL
[1:25:15] <Raishiro> pick up your gold!
[1:25:36] <+not_crabby> floorgang awoog
[1:25:53] <$RealThiele> opposite chosen
[1:25:56] <not_twitter_rowan> i can appreciate it for the gorgeous art and animation but the hordes of enemies are just too much
[1:26:00] <+Regigangster> @not_twitter_rowan That didnt feel like a negative example
[1:26:14] <%ChaoticWaha> ChaoticWaha subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! ye
[1:26:21] <Malkarii> @not_twitter_rowan the hordes of enemies are the fun part
[1:26:24] <+Regigangster> ye
[1:26:24] <pixelpaggos> can someone dude me a solid and remind me the name of the bastion style rouge like pat played. blood something?
[1:26:31] <not_twitter_rowan> @not_twitter_rowan fair enough. it gets VERY egregious later I feel
[1:26:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> who is Aaron
[1:26:41] <%NeoCre> Go up
[1:26:42] <+Regigangster> LUL
[1:26:53] <AzureGale> It probably was just a health pack
[1:26:53] <%Ranryu692> now you know going forward
[1:26:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Was that Grandpa?
[1:27:01] <+Gui1tyGhost> pat just straight ignoring the event rooms
[1:27:04] <%Ranryu692> is this a rogue like or light?
[1:27:06] <%isolex_> just dig up
[1:27:07] <not_twitter_rowan> @Malkarii honestly, the hordes of enemies were what I was slogging through to get more of the animation
[1:27:10] <%Pappajimbo> teleport
[1:27:11] <$RealThiele> lite
[1:27:19] <Malkarii> @PatStaresAt you'll see the first level many times, don't worry
[1:27:21] <Zebroneath> That did look like a sealed location
[1:27:25] <+Regigangster> I am
[1:27:26] <not_twitter_rowan> so when i entered the second region I went "fuck it" and stopped playing
[1:27:40] <not_twitter_rowan> because oh my GOD the second region
[1:27:50] <Raishiro> and this is the part where linda is hilarious, stand behind barriers and shoot everything
[1:27:55] <$RealThiele> new areas are supposed to make you feel overwhelmed at first imo
[1:28:01] <%AncelDeLambert> .... IS THAT THE GOOSEBUMPS THEME MUSIC?!!!
[1:28:07] <%RyTYoung> it's a bitch of a second area
[1:28:13] <+Regigangster> Clap
[1:28:16] <AzureGale> GOTEM
[1:28:23] <not_twitter_rowan> @RealThiele fair, but like I said, I was not a fan of the horde mechanic in the first place
[1:28:25] <$RealThiele> Boo
[1:28:25] <Malkarii> the second area is intense, yeah LOL
[1:28:40] <Zeldrick> You could say that they are "Children of More-Ta" Kappa
[1:28:46] <$RealThiele> yea if hordes not your bag then this game will cause frustration
[1:28:53] <%Parapattern> That's what Paige's period looks like
[1:28:57] <Malkarii> @not_twitter_rowan that's fair. it does get easier as you grind up the family's levels/skills
[1:29:14] <Malkarii> it certainly can get stressfuk
[1:29:19] <not_twitter_rowan> @RealThiele it also really doesn't feel like any of the characters are designed to fight horde but for Linda
[1:29:21] <Malkarii> stressful*
[1:29:24] <%heartlesshealer> psaGiefrail
[1:29:29] <%RyTYoung> @parapattern WutFace WutFace WutFace
[1:29:45] <SFdvus> 3k views for BG3 800 views fors this lol
[1:30:01] <Malkarii> @not_twitter_rowan the dad and kevin are good for hordes. their rage mechanic helps tons
[1:30:16] <%RyTYoung> @sfdvus This game is old hence the lesser view count
[1:30:17] <%TheWinged7> skeleton warriors
[1:30:22] <%RyTYoung> only by like a year
[1:30:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Every door you open is an immediate party room.
[1:30:32] <%afronooch> 3k views for brand new game
[1:30:41] <%Profmcstevie> Baldurs Gate is a household name
[1:30:44] <$Invlux> Orb Kreygasm
[1:30:44] <+Solutha> BG3 is also a mess
[1:30:47] <SFdvus> yea im for the orbs
[1:30:47] <+YamChop> im here for the Meatball
[1:30:47] <Malkarii> I have to admit I'm a very biased fan. I do PR for this game Kappa
[1:30:49] <%heartlesshealer> 🟣👀
[1:30:51] <$RealThiele> Joey is great for horde
[1:30:51] <not_twitter_rowan> @Malkarii yeah, maybe. I might give it a try again, I think my memories of the game have been tainted by the bad note i left on
[1:30:55] <%OperatorJo_> DansGame
[1:31:03] <%Agami23> dont worry, if you streamed balders gate like 2 more times you would get less viewers than this
[1:31:06] <%Piemen99> IM here for the dog and cat who is the souless ginger?
[1:31:08] <%crimsonharvest> I'm just here for the reassurance that my kind of stupid is normal
[1:31:20] <%RyTYoung> Truffle shuffling though life
[1:31:24] <$RealThiele> *SNOOF*
[1:31:24] <%afronooch> John Marketing in chat
[1:31:41] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat do you care about gaining followers or subscribers? what's your view on that aspect of "influencerdom"?
[1:31:42] <not_twitter_rowan> also is it just me or do Gemstones have a fucking TINY drop rate in this game
[1:31:49] <%heartlesshealer> bird?
[1:31:52] <SFdvus> ginger is orb, odd shape for ginger
[1:32:06] <Malkarii> the gemstones are so hard to come by. that annoys me the most, probably
[1:32:09] <$RealThiele> focusing on viewer count too hard will drive you insane id imagine
[1:32:10] <%Agami23> eric looks like he has fallen off the deep end
[1:32:13] <+UrielCobalt> WTF? There is a new Erin Andre season coming?
[1:32:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> We lost the venture but got andre
[1:32:29] <%RyTYoung> I have never watched any episode of Eric Andre, is it worth watching? only ever saw clips of the show
[1:32:34] <bcdenton> @not_twitter_rowan you can increase the droprate with the perma-upgrade gold shop
[1:32:40] <%Parapattern> That commercial for the new Eric Andre season is something else
[1:32:47] <%Dementedpenguin> Uh.......
[1:32:49] <DianaTheAscian> post more
[1:32:50] <+DarthPlaugas> Pfff
[1:32:51] <%scrumbotime> key word there, TRY
[1:32:54] <Mr_Strut> That is not true
[1:32:56] <$RealThiele> traps hurt friend and foe
[1:32:57] <not_twitter_rowan> @bcdenton ah, good to know

[1:33:05] <+cappyd33> but pat you're influencing me right NOW
[1:33:05] <Saltmeisterr> u are not poggers

[1:33:29] <Malkarii> the term "influencer" has become so cringe
[1:33:29] <%AncelDeLambert> "I GOTTA BE AN INFLUENCER! THAT'S WHERE THE BIG BUCKS ARE!!"
[1:33:30] <not_twitter_rowan> you can't "make" a viral video. They just happen
[1:33:31] <%Parapattern> That wasn't very poggers of you Pat
[1:33:33] <Gallhint> its engineered
[1:33:34] <T_Sasquatch> To be fair there's a formula for making a viral video
[1:33:35] <%Agami23> if you make a video about resident evil is it a viral video?
[1:33:35] <SFdvus> is viral the v in vtuber
[1:33:36] <$RealThiele> ego vs reality
[1:33:40] <%heartlesshealer> just make one with your PhD in psychology
[1:33:59] <Gallhint> thats sweet
[1:34:00] <T_Sasquatch> You can make a very soul less viral video
[1:34:05] <bcdenton> pat this is super important this unlocks merchants in future runs

[1:36:43] <wannabemoogle> children
[1:36:51] <+NickHatesSnow> Like me
[1:36:54] <T_Sasquatch> Its pretty saturated
[1:36:54] <%RyTYoung> Pat shoots up to the top of twitch, number go up
[1:36:56] <%UvBenServed> Fortnite or Minecraft
[1:37:05] <$RealThiele> watch that train wreck
[1:37:11] <$Invlux> But it wouldn't be GENUINE
[1:37:12] <%Dementedpenguin> I will come for the trainwreck in chat.
[1:37:16] <%RyTYoung> Minecraft, so much more chill
[1:37:16] <%MechArch> knit?
[1:37:18] <AzureGale> You gotta keep them

[1:37:21] <%heartlesshealer> chesuto
[1:37:24] <%Ranryu692> yeah, I would watch one (1) Pat Fortnite stream, and probably no more than that lol
[1:37:26] <Aydarkzero> there's a LOT of other people doing the same thing
[1:37:28] <T_Sasquatch> I wish i liked Fortnite . I really really wish i did
[1:37:28] <+pectusumbra> *nod*
[1:37:31] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[1:37:35] <%cvp5127> aim for the bottom
[1:37:40] <%Parapattern> Also you might become pigeon holed if you're not careful
[1:37:42] <%Profmcstevie> Trend chasing is a marathon with no goal, fuuuck that
[1:37:44] <ItsMisterJason> TL:DR : You do you boo
[1:37:45] <%Ranryu692> You'd rather be a big fish in a small tank
[1:37:48] <$RealThiele> lowered expectations
[1:37:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt You chasing a person who is leading, When you could go off and lead somehwhere else
[1:37:53] <+NickHatesSnow> I'd watch Pat try a Minecraft Adventure run
[1:37:57] <%Meltdown547> It's the same problem when everyone makes the BR, or Moba, or hero shooter.
[1:37:58] <black_pariah> other than doom i cant remember the last time you played a twitch reflex shooter
[1:37:58] <%RyTYoung> Fortnite was fun at first, then everyone became a big sweaty builder
[1:37:59] <MissFantasy> that is cery true
[1:38:01] <MissFantasy> very*
[1:38:03] <deephurting114> Just have fun your way
[1:38:03] <%Agami23> thats just a gohma
[1:38:06] <+pectusumbra> There's actually kind of a story with this with the Vtuber Aki Rosenthal. It was only after she stopped worrying about views and such that she was able to blossom and really grow
[1:38:17] <Raishiro> what's the bet pat loses to this boss
[1:38:18] <DianaTheAscian> thats true

[1:38:36] <SFdvus> ay pat since your answering big questions. I wanted to asked why you dont do more LPs with woolie? Is it to keep your your friendship in tack?
[1:38:39] <$RealThiele> LUL machinima telling people how to be successful
[1:38:40] <+DarthPlaugas> The fuck is that fight
[1:38:58] <+DarthPlaugas> Can't move and boss spawns adds that spawn adds
[1:39:00] <@SoFarFetched> @SFdvus Woolie's schedule gets more packed with what he has to do with his channel and stream

[1:43:54] <%psychodave1234> psychodave1234 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 45 months! whats this nerd shit for nerds its not the new hotness
[1:43:55] <%AncelDeLambert> Fool some of the people all of the time, or all of the people some of the time. All of the people some of the time is WAY more stressful
[1:43:56] <+Maggoo245> Maggoo245 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:44:00] <%zeif00> I know people that are STUCK playing the same game
[1:44:00] <T_Sasquatch> Atleast LOOK at the thing in the first week
[1:44:02] <RoboticRexkek> I'm just thinking of all the CoD youtubers that are all gone now.
[1:44:06] <$RealThiele> start that only orb fans
[1:44:06] <%Meltdown547> Are they there for you, or the thing you're chasing? Because the thing you're chasing will go away. The person won't.
[1:44:07] <@SoFarFetched> @DarthPlaugas if you're a subcriber on this channel yes there is a discord.
[1:44:12] <%crimsonharvest> @DarthPlaugas subbing automatically gets you in yes
[1:44:16] <not_twitter_rowan> @T_Sasquatch wait really? I only know about the Smash Ultimate from the panty fighter game and them joking about it
[1:44:17] <+DarthPlaugas> FUCK
[1:44:21] <blackbookalpha> pigeon-holed
[1:44:22] <@SoFarFetched> You need to manually set it in discord.
[1:44:22] <Aydarkzero> there's only so many Lore Videos you can do
[1:44:24] <%Profmcstevie> If you're day 2 Gold rank in new game, they'll go to day 1 Diamond rank in new game. You can't chase people obsessed with this chase
[1:44:24] <londorpaleale> Gotta beat that horse
[1:44:28] <%Lion_kun> You were 750k for the longest time.
[1:44:29] <MissFantasy> i've only been here specifically for a couple months but i'm still subbed to super best friends. i watch the videos almost every day and have for the last 4-5 years

[1:44:30] <@SoFarFetched> to make sure tis connected to PatStaresAt
[1:44:30] <%heartlesshealer> I think the only one I dropped was M. Because he doesn't do well alone?
[1:44:37] <+Pyroclase> Then there's Wrel, who is currently the Lead Designer on the game he covered on youtube.
[1:44:39] <$RealThiele> soul 1, deprived, broken sword, etc
[1:44:40] <+DarthPlaugas> Why don't I know things
[1:44:45] <%luftraumm1> more accurately its updated to being boring
[1:44:45] <T_Sasquatch> Woolie should've atleast looked at genshin impact within the MONTH of its release just for exposure
[1:44:48] <+pajamarammaslamma> not naming names but there are streamers who hate their games and are financially obligated to play them
[1:44:54] <deephurting114> Have different things to make vids on
[1:44:58] <deephurting114> Like 5
[1:45:00] <DianaTheAscian> never cover one thing to much
[1:45:01] <@SoFarFetched> @DarthPlaugas You probably didn't read Pat's "about me" cause it's mentioned in there LUL

[1:45:39] <not_twitter_rowan> @pajamarammaslamma A lot of LoL streamers goddamn hate solo q, the best ones have switched over to co-streaming and casting

[1:45:47] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt It's quite literally diversifying your portfolio
[1:45:49] <%crimsonharvest> rip stream?
[1:45:49] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[1:45:51] <not_twitter_rowan> like the one exception is T1
[1:45:53] <+Greetings_Gentlemen> elmo cast blade dance
[1:45:55] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat that's a very accurate point, I was thinking about all of that because I've been watching vinny lately and I really cannot understand why the hell he's so popular, he seems very genuine and laid back, very different from the "stars" of this platform
[1:45:57] <%Meltdown547> Ironpineapple has recently been branching out, and getting some real success breaking out of the Fromsoft only hole.
[1:45:57] <%OperatorJo_> he ATTAC psaPorgmo psaGib
[1:46:03] <+pajamarammaslamma> @t_sasquatch i was thinking of a classic cod streamer who cries on stream and will literally lose his home if he stops streaming
[1:46:03] <deephurting114> Fuck yeah upgrades
[1:46:08] <$RealThiele> upgrade exp gains
[1:46:10] <%DarthPlaugas> DarthPlaugas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! I should have kept this up but I'm an idiot
[1:46:14] <T_Sasquatch> @not_twitter_rowan they talked about it. Ofcourse they planned to do it but something fucked happened that the recording had to be erased from existence
[1:46:18] <@SoFarFetched> It also depends if you're a streamer that brings in the thousands of viewers regardless of what you stream.
[1:46:33] <@SoFarFetched> Cause those have the advantage of streaming whatever they w ant.
[1:46:33] <not_twitter_rowan> @Meltdown547 His "Souls-like" series is gerat
[1:46:36] <%cvp5127> just be hot
[1:46:37] <deephurting114> The sacred Algorithm
[1:46:39] <%heartlesshealer> algorithm is super sketch and I hate those chasers
[1:46:40] <RoboticRexkek> MatPat is the king of the algorithm.
[1:46:42] <$RealThiele> 1. be attractive 2. dont be unattractive
[1:46:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[1:46:57] <%Agami23> like woolie trying to chase the algorithm?
[1:46:58] <$Dakuu75> that little girl was jumping over the cat. DUDE, I'd be so fuckign scared to try that. if I jumped ONTO my cat... oof.
[1:47:05] <T_Sasquatch> @pajamarammaslamma imma be honest , that sounds like that person needs a much better plan for life
[1:47:07] <SFdvus> pat you seem happy, and thats all thats matter rights?
[1:47:07] <+pajamarammaslamma> pat is the sexiest streamer its unfair
[1:47:11] <@SoFarFetched> like how I watch a streamer who got 10k viewers from streaming Phoenix Wright,cause that's how big her audience usually is anyway.
[1:47:17] <+Pyroclase> One of these days someone's gonna figure out how to break the algorithm, and just fill everyone's recommendations with videos of rocks or something.
[1:47:17] <CappuccinoGuil> As someone who did send keys out to people for games, what you play is super important to get us to make a decision
[1:47:18] <%heartlesshealer> I think woolie is just trying to avoid music demonetization
[1:47:18] <%Dingus_Tickler> Dingus_Tickler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months, currently on a 45 month streak! 45 Years in the Woolie Hole moon2W

[1:48:17] <%BoxNavy> being alive sucks when you dont have food water and shelter
[1:48:18] <ToneBacas> @AncelDeLambert right?
[1:48:21] <SFdvus> based on orb, I would say food is a major key to you happiness
[1:48:22] <$RealThiele> mating
[1:48:26] <%OperatorJo_> Big truths
[1:48:27] <DianaTheAscian> that is basic human need
[1:48:28] <%luftraumm1> maslow is a sociological postulate about populations, it tracks on that perspective
[1:48:34] <+pajamarammaslamma> pat needs to avoid his fallback of being a professional okikron streamer
[1:48:36] <AzureGale> ANCIENT RAY *pew pew pew*
[1:48:38] <%Fooguwu> Fun fact: Maslow didn't make the pyramid. That was a structure some dumbass gave his needs thing because he didn't understand the nuance of it
[1:48:39] <%DarthPlaugas> Something to do
[1:48:41] <ToneBacas> this is not true to every living person
[1:48:43] <%Parapattern> Maslow's Pyramid of Maslows
[1:48:44] <%DarthPlaugas> mate
[1:48:45] <CappuccinoGuil> 2nd layer is Safety and Security. That means FINANCIAL, MENTAL AND PHYSICAL
[1:48:46] <%toastybites> Maslow also based that pyramid on what he called the "master race" so
[1:48:47] <+Pookiedaexzile> first comes the food, then the wate, then the shelter....then the BITCHEs
[1:48:51] <%DarthPlaugas> Companionship
[1:48:59] <not_twitter_rowan> OOF
[1:49:01] <thelonechris> Starving artist
[1:49:03] <$Invlux> Money can't buy happiness, but it SURE AS HELL gives you the means to be happy
[1:49:09] <+lazylazzer> What about the khakis
[1:49:10] <$RealThiele> maslov sounds like a poor person during the bolsheviks
[1:49:16] <%Garthunox> You're also very honest pat, you dont put on a character like in the machinma videos
[1:49:16] <+dmtjinni> 1ST IS LIFTING
[1:49:18] <T_Sasquatch> Money Power PUPPERS
[1:49:22] <Sartastic> then you get the sugar
[1:49:24] <%AncelDeLambert> I think Clarence Bodicker put it best: Bitches leave
[1:49:25] <%Fooguwu> Maslow's needs are better described as a boat full of holes, not a pyramid. He never made it a pyramid
[1:49:26] <%DarthPlaugas> Yep
[1:49:26] <T_Sasquatch> I can't blame him tbh LUL
[1:49:28] <deephurting114> Gotta get the paper
[1:49:29] <AzureGale> Then you tell people to say hello to your little friend
[1:49:29] <%UvBenServed> paige
[1:49:30] <%Garthunox> WHAT
[1:49:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sad

[1:49:34] <%Dementedpenguin> Paige WutFace
[1:49:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> People forget thats how that movie ends
[1:49:34] <DianaTheAscian> who?
[1:49:35] <T_Sasquatch> Jesus
[1:49:35] <SFdvus> is power food in that equation
[1:49:35] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat that's a very accurate point, I was thinking about all of that because I've been watching vinny lately and I really cannot understand why the hell he's so popular, he seems very genuine and laid back, very different from the "stars" of this platform
[1:49:36] <%heartlesshealer> welp

[1:50:07] <%Dementedpenguin> I need to rewatch that movie
[1:50:08] <%toastybites> Tony Montana is a good litmus test for age
[1:50:09] <%Garthunox> THIS IS THE TALE, OF TONY MONTANA
[1:50:10] <AzureGale> I mean, Scarface is a kind of old movie...

[1:51:21] <%maenos2> jumping spiders are cute
[1:51:21] <sdgundum990> If you want to be the big strong you should take the rest of your levels in sorcerer to get big huge eldritch blasts.

[1:51:25] <$Dakuu75> I don't mind spiders... as long as they're smaller than a dime
[1:51:25] <%Finakala> Just a bunch of torsos running about on boners
[1:51:27] <blackbookalpha> Mosquitoes are worse they give you curses
[1:51:28] <%cylish> Oh yeah, try having a camel spider jumping at you
[1:51:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Bongo spider is great
[1:51:30] <thelonechris> I like them :(
[1:51:31] <pixelpaggos> so long as the spider isnt near me i let them be, they eat other pests and thats pretty cool
[1:51:32] <LoneFonte> until they jump at you
[1:51:32] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah but they jump tho
[1:51:34] <dots4eyes> Jumping spiders are the best

[1:52:18] <%Jekado> sounds sexual
[1:52:19] <Mr_Strut> That sounds like a fucking cult

[2:02:38] <marklarphd> Become a Vtuber, discard your meatsack
[2:02:39] <%Jekado> Man-o-War XO skeleton?
[2:02:39] <+Sendrak70> Skeleton s are just mechs without their brain pilots.
[2:02:41] <%PanicSwytch> Should I Google Nightmare Tits?
[2:02:43] <+Pookiedaexzile> Night Mare Tits are just Rule 63 toppless Knightmare
[2:02:43] <+Kitafin> like sparda
[2:02:44] <bcdenton> Pat wishes to become Sparda
[2:02:44] <EternalJedi> limesD HENSHIN
[2:02:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @YakumoYomi no we are not hard and the musle system is outside the skeleton
[2:02:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Which
[2:02:48] <%cowardlord> A good reason
[2:03:01] <$RealThiele> you can google anything if you're brave enough
[2:03:04] <%zeif00> Does Paige know about the fat skeletons with the blue goo orbs?
[2:03:07] <@SoFarFetched> Humans are the most brittle things
[2:03:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Henshin a go go Baby!
[2:03:11] <+Pookiedaexzile> Googled Nightmare Tits
[2:03:13] <%RyTYoung> @panicswytch uuuuuhhh you might get Nightmare from Soul Calibur...with tita

[2:03:20] <%RyTYoung> tits*
[2:03:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Seems like it.
[2:03:34] <%DarthPlaugas> Hmmm
[2:03:34] <@SoFarFetched> LUL cause we're talking about bones
[2:03:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SoFarFetched we dumped all our stats into intellegence and endurance
[2:03:47] <%Fooguwu> being squishy is our strength and our weakness
[2:03:48] <$RealThiele> nightmare tits might also be a soul calibur swap
[2:03:50] <%RyTYoung> nyeh
[2:03:51] <%rdark_ksu> the human body is crazy fragile but can withstand more than you'd think but less than you'd hope
[2:03:55] <%DarthPlaugas> Yea but we also have an adrenal response so we are also STRONC
[2:04:00] <Ipsenscastle> wet skellys
[2:04:05] <AzureGale> They're actually made of cake

[2:04:16] <%YakumoYomi> Don't they have that Corruption goo inside them?
[2:04:17] <+Pyroclase> Maybe their audio equipment is busted
[2:04:21] <%RyTYoung> Still got some moist cartilage I see
[2:04:22] <londorpaleale> WAB
[2:04:23] <+RenoDeGeneric> Not the BONE SQUELCHING!
[2:04:23] <%DarthPlaugas> And we don't just die when going into shock
[2:04:24] <%MechArch> bone marrow
[2:04:30] <%rdark_ksu> bone marrow can be juicy if you nice and warm
[2:04:36] <Ipsenscastle> they're supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders
[2:04:41] <oniwrath> bone hurting juice
[2:04:44] <$RealThiele> previous bone
[2:04:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @rdark_ksu the human body is both incredibly weak for creatures of similar size and suprisingly powerful seeing we do not use our full systems

[2:05:19] <%RyTYoung> @t_sasquatch As in the movie?! I'd love to know LUL
[2:05:21] <%DarthPlaugas> So yea humans both more brittle and less brittle than one might think...except Paige she is exactly as brittle as you would expect

[2:27:39] <%YakumoYomi> The subgenre namer
[2:27:42] <T_Sasquatch> When you say Rogue i think of Xmen first

[2:28:07] <RoboticRexkek> featuring rogue-like from the rogue series
[2:28:13] <%Broand> It's not a MUD tho
[2:28:16] <%BinaryFireball> Dark Souls is a souls like
[2:28:17] <%DarthPlaugas> It should just say rogue since it is
[2:28:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> Nobody has thought of a name for this giant genre
[2:28:20] <$RealThiele> Perma-death dungeon simulator

[2:28:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Roguelike has lasted longer than Doom Clone
[2:28:35] <@SoFarFetched> Rogue was a game that came out in 1980

[2:29:18] <+TheBitingIrish> People in general are stupid *shrug*
[2:29:18] <@SoFarFetched> Paige influences people with skeletons
[2:29:20] <%NeoCre> I mean, it is technically a Roguelike. An identical object is the most like itself
[2:29:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> she has skills
[2:29:26] <TumbleDryer_ExhaustPipe> in a way we're all influencers CrreamAwk

[2:31:21] <%AncelDeLambert> we purposefully trained him to hump, as a joke
[2:31:23] <Oncamimus> Bulldogs are generally pretty horny...my tio and tia used to keep them...anything with a leg got humped

[2:32:58] <+AGood_Noodle> This is the best stream
[2:32:59] <+TheBitingIrish> Yea, it's a toss-up whether or not getting snipped will stop a dog from humping or marking
[2:33:01] <%AncelDeLambert> dog snip involves REMOVAL, so, yeah

[2:34:30] <CappuccinoGuil> I've never seen it
[2:34:30] <+TheBitingIrish> I'm sure they could make dog snips reversible, but it'd cost more and why bother?
[2:34:31] <FalseEyeD> This explains things
[2:34:34] <+FlyingRamen> shit

[2:51:27] <+Kitafin> what about jonathan
[2:51:29] <%SaiyanShoto> they could've named him turbo
[2:51:30] <T_Sasquatch> Most biblical names are lazy as fuck
[2:51:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> "It was...my Fathers name...and what are you doing in our hospital room Red Orb man"
[2:51:35] <AzureGale> Better to name your kid John than to name your kid Turok :x

[3:02:18] <@SoFarFetched> Uncle Ben D:
[3:02:23] <Hydrapissed> who knows maybe there is pat
[3:02:24] <%heartlesshealer> They don't know when it'll stop working
[3:02:25] <%Fooguwu> maybe it theoretically has a limited amount of juice
[3:02:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I think that only works when you go through the crystal or something...dunno.
[3:02:26] <%Mr_Pylon> I imagine that pain exists
[3:02:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> Death is traumatic Pat
[3:02:30] <Mr_Strut> Killed, not necessarily trapped or horribly maimed
[3:02:33] <%TheLemuroid> But angst
[3:02:40] <+buffn99> With great power comes great responsibility - Uncle Ben
[3:02:43] <AzureGale> I dunno, getting close to death would probably hurt really bad still
[3:02:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> Rogue Boy Activated

[3:44:06] <%Alazull> Alazull subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey apparently 13 months? It must needs be remarked that a big skeleton would really add to the occasional Contrapoints reference. Love you guys and Pat let us know how baking adventures go.

[3:46:25] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt is Elmo too wobbly to get onto the counter?
[3:46:41] <+Eizack> Almost closed door meaning the door isn't closed meaning it can be opened?
[3:46:41] <+unstoppabull1> put it on top of the kitchen table
[3:46:54] <%Alazull> that is not food safety
[3:46:59] <%BubbaRands> On the table? like he's people?
[3:47:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> We always had a rule of no fuzzy faces at the table (no cats on table).
[3:47:01] <$Invlux> could get baby a cat tower and put it up there
[3:47:02] <%ssjklyco> Just get an ikea table for elmo
[3:47:04] <%za7az> put it on the toilet? Kappa
[3:47:04] <+TheBitingIrish> You guys eat at a table? DansGame
[3:47:05] <+tacostarvedbeast> man cranberry juice is so gooood
[3:47:22] <%Ranryu692> My parents used to put one cat's food on the counter because the other cat was too fat to get up there
[3:47:34] <%ElkRiverDog> On the cat tree?
[3:47:37] <%NeoCre> Never a good idea to reward a cat for climbing onto food surfaces
[3:47:51] <Rionxgarland> chonky boy

[3:48:26] <@SoFarFetched> PULP
[3:48:30] <AzureGale> Welcome to the show. Please come inside
[3:48:30] <%ssjklyco> Pulp is great
[3:48:33] <%Alazull> yes pulp
[3:48:34] <+tacostarvedbeast> some brands put to much suger in OJ but still pretty good
[3:48:37] <%cvp5127> gross
[3:48:38] <%toastybites> orange juice makes my teeth feel brittle
[3:48:41] <LilacsandFreedom> pulp is awful
[3:48:47] <Mr_Strut> 100% pulp
[3:48:48] <+lordericter> mmm not a big fan of that much pulp
[3:48:50] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I had some pulpy OJ just now. Gotta get that Calcium and Vitamins C and D
[3:48:52] <$joylent_blue> pulp is horrendous
[3:48:52] <%Alazull> give us one pulp
[3:48:54] <%toastybites> Pulp lovers unite
[3:48:56] <%Ranryu692> I always get the orange juice that comes with the pulp that they take out of the cowards' juice
[3:48:56] <%BubbaRands> Pulp is good. No pulp is just sugar water
[3:48:57] <Oncamimus> nice
[3:49:02] <%ssjklyco> it's not orange juice with out pulp. Otherwise it's just water
[3:49:04] <Kain5707> oops all pulp
[3:49:05] <Mr_Strut> Pulp is what makes OJ worth drinking
[3:49:07] <%snackcanary> snackcanary subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 9 Months Baby. I got nothing to say but that Third Strike really is that good. Old Reliable.
[3:49:07] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> medium to high pulp is the best
[3:49:07] <%Alazull> when the juice is stompin
[3:49:08] <%Ranryu692> Pulp pulp the jam, pulp it up, while the beat is pulping
[3:49:09] <ChungusQuest> Fuck orange juice, it's all about that orange slurry.
[3:49:10] <%TheLemuroid> Pulp is the best unless it is milk pulp
[3:49:12] <$joylent_blue> no pulp arnj juice is superior
[3:49:13] <%thebeargoesHONK> I think the Corruption is just Furry goo
[3:49:15] <Bigyanno> JUICE SHOULDN'T BE SOLID
[3:49:21] <Mr_Strut> It's basically just a pulp delivery system
[3:49:23] <%ssjklyco> Pulpers please
[3:49:30] <+JavaManJoJo> I get the extra pulp orange juice. I want to chew my oj
[3:49:30] <+tacostarvedbeast> put that feeling of drinking some OJ after brushing ur teeth ruins my whole morning
[3:49:32] <%Ranryu692> @TheLemuroid plz no

[3:50:24] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> You are correct to love it
[3:50:25] <%baronblank> might not be bad to do after pretty much doing everything in Hades
[3:50:29] <vonpimpenstein> it's truly great
[3:50:34] <%Taisuru> Was listening to the podcast, you bullying woolie about his Baiken shit had me rolling

[3:50:58] <Kain5707> HLD is so good
[3:51:03] <%Alazull> I take only the finest jelly beans with my milksteak
[3:51:15] <Saltmeisterr> its not that hard
[3:51:16] <%barkon345> is there loot drops in this game?\
[3:51:20] <BoSteed> HLD is really great

[3:51:28] <Kain5707> you fite
[3:51:32] <%Fooguwu> I quit HLD cuz it feels bad to play. Felt like dodge timing was broken
[3:51:42] <%justcallmebobplease> It doesn't need to be hard for my assness to make it prohibitively difficult to progress in.
[3:51:48] <%Taisuru> psaDogchamp Give catfood

[4:22:50] <%heartlesshealer> good babies

[4:23:05] <%Agami23> it was real chill today. helped with my bad headache
[4:23:10] <Oncamimus> indeed
[4:23:11] <WillofGame> Lots of fun. Glad you had fun. Have a good night everyone!
[4:23:14] <%Taisuru> Why would your voice get deeped when HE gets bigger?

[4:23:30] <AzureGale> Gotta strain
[4:23:42] <Oncamimus> indeed...he will still be your baby forever though :3
[4:23:45] <+lordericter> so how many hours do they say is in straight progression for BG3 atm?
[4:23:54] <%Agami23> could do the new spooky dlc with paige
[4:23:55] <%Ranryu692> Streets of Kamurocho?
[4:24:27] <@SoFarFetched> she might BRAP too hard

[4:25:20] <%weissguard> It's gonna be a fucking trip, can't wait.
[4:25:23] <Mr_Strut> lolno
[4:25:25] <$Invlux> Thanks for brining Yakuza to the west, Pat
[4:25:25] <Oncamimus> you will be the go to
[4:25:27] <%cvp5127> lol no
[4:25:27] <%SirGO0SE> Pat invented Yakuza
[4:25:32] <%Agami23> and you didnt even get the game early like woops
[4:25:33] <%SaiyanShoto> It's not like you're a Yakuza fan or something
[4:25:51] <$joylent_blue> i'm amazed its gonna be dubbed
[4:26:04] <$Invlux> I can't believe Pat singlehandedly localized and published Yakuza in the west
[4:26:12] <AzureGale> It's like that gun from Ratchet & Clank
[4:26:27] <%Ranryu692> is Mark Hamill voicing Majima again?
[4:26:28] <+doomunderthestairs> I'm playing Judgement right now and even that had a dub
[4:26:31] <Pomer> @joylent_blue right? i was shocked when judgement was dubbed, and dubbed really well
[4:27:05] <$joylent_blue> pat does a big think pvpHmm
[4:27:07] <%heartlesshealer> Randomly zebra research: Zebra stripes deter biting flies from landing on them.
[4:27:08] <Mr_Strut> Think hard
[4:27:12] <%Ranryu692> is it not 14 at this point?
[4:27:12] <Oncamimus> ....
[4:27:17] <Visorak6> this is an important question
[4:27:18] <olaksi> stream froze?
[4:27:19] <Mr_Strut> The internet will remember this
[4:27:21] <%Alazull> just say 7
[4:27:23] <AzureGale> Um
[4:27:28] <artoflec> elaHYUK
[4:27:40] <LilacsandFreedom> good choices, good choices
[4:27:45] <AzureGale> Good choice
[4:27:49] <$joylent_blue> that's an... acceptable answer
[4:27:51] <+dr_zaius0> It's gotta be 5. Dat job system doe.

[4:29:12] <%ssjklyco> It's a shame Chrono trigger is dead
[4:29:17] <$joylent_blue> fair

[4:29:19] <%Alazull> look dog, that's fair but not an FF game
