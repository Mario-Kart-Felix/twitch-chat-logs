Amazing how a game about filing insurance claims, no actual combat and, made by basically one guy. Is more exciting then a game about killing zombies and revenge made by a AAA company with crunch time!
[0:13:12] <%NovaKnightmare> @PatStaresAt Plan to check out the Cyberpunk stream on thursday?

[0:30:16] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @J0j0nes unless they're into that... lol
[0:30:17] <%DappercatEsquire> At least you found out who you can trust
[0:30:20] <%delilah4you> I disagree
[0:30:20] <%Dementedpenguin> Where's Wayne Brady when you need him?
[0:30:21] <%Frost_Quill> Time to find out who among your family are actually huge pieces of shit.
[0:30:21] <+NitronStreams> Fambly
[0:30:22] <%deviljhojho_> just steal the money from her crikIQ
[0:30:23] <%delilah4you> Fuck family
[0:30:23] <%logoth_> Agreed
[0:30:23] <CriticKitten> Cut toxic people outta your life, even if they're family
[0:30:24] <daisyyyy> you can, actually!
[0:30:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> not me
[0:30:25] <ionands> Woolie's racism came out on stream hard
[0:30:27] <sulkcessor> word
[0:30:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEAH
[0:30:28] <hectic_harlequin> But you can choose how your family DIES limesGun
[0:30:28] <%delilah4you> I can choose my family no problem just watch me
[0:30:28] <%superc37> what happun
[0:30:29] <%eanscrale> YEAH
[0:30:29] <%MaritimeSpanker> YES!
[0:30:31] <SGrim> 6k is a whole chunk of money, but not if your pulling 200k
[0:30:33] <%eanscrale> YEYEYEYE
[0:30:33] <%MaritimeSpanker> Goddamm, do I agree!
[0:30:35] <+artschooltrash> Amen
[0:30:38] <%SirGO0SE> @ionands RACE WAR
[0:30:40] <%MisterRockett> I love my sisters if any of them screwed me out of 6K I would not rest until I squeezed that money out of them.
[0:30:41] <+GadGamer> You can love family and still totally dislike them
[0:30:41] <King_Wolf_Rigger> people who value family, would take care of family when they fuck them over.
[0:30:42] <%ssjklyco> Don't have kids if you won't pay for their property damage
[0:30:42] <%weissguard> Family means more than the blood in your veins, imo.
[0:30:42] <%delilah4you> I cant choose blood, but also fuck blood
[0:30:43] <%optimasmaximas> @ionands wait what
[0:30:44] <%Typhaeon> I disagree mostly
[0:30:45] <Buka_Zero> family = randos
[0:30:46] <+FaultyJawa> FUCKING PREACH PAT
[0:30:47] <ionands> The race war has started
[0:30:50] <daisyyyy> you can't choose who you are related to, but you can choose your family
[0:30:50] <%MaritimeSpanker> Most in the family are alright, and then there's THAT fucking person, the niece
[0:30:50] <AtrusHB> You can choose your in-laws though... pogonaThink
[0:30:51] <filialpails> this guy's family is worth about $6000 apparently
[0:30:53] <$roguemerc69> you abolutely can choose your family, blood of battle is thicker than the water of the womb
[0:30:59] <$Dakuu75> I like staying close to my family (incase I need an organ transplant)
[0:30:59] <asurite_warrior> We no longer live in a world where family ties mean success or failure.
[0:31:01] <%Valdorick> Then you have your FUCKING BROTHER
[0:31:04] <%heartlesshealer> We fucking cut away my great aunt from the entire rest of our family's wills for bullshit
[0:31:04] <ionands> Woolie in paper mario just did a big oops
[0:31:06] <%optimasmaximas> @ionands what happened?
[0:31:06] <curse85> i always come in after tlou2 conversation...why is pat not playing it? can chat answer me
[0:31:12] <%delilah4you> Thats, all of my family
[0:31:12] <hectic_harlequin> Yep
[0:31:18] <%SirGO0SE> you cant save them all
[0:31:18] <hectic_harlequin> Family of trash
[0:31:21] <%bendatron> agreed
[0:31:23] <ionands> The puni and jabbi war
[0:31:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @delilah4you same
[0:31:24] <%Starotter70> When are you gonna sue your bro for stealing Silent Hill?
[0:31:24] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[0:31:24] <%delilah4you> I come from a group of southern baptist hicks, and they can all go fuck themselves
[0:31:29] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @roguemerc69 Yes! Another person that knows the whole saying.
[0:31:29] <SGrim> @curse85 it's not even funny bad. It's just boring.
[0:31:32] <thelonechris> Family...family...family
[0:31:32] <%superc37> @curse85 cuz its bad
[0:31:34] <hectic_harlequin> Precisely
[0:31:37] <%Dementedpenguin> It's such a garbage excuse.
[0:31:38] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt Blood is thicker than water actually means the OPPOSITE. Water means water of the womb.
[0:31:38] <ulricelderhart> what's the whole story here? feel like a lot is being left out
[0:31:38] <%optimasmaximas> FUCK FAMILY
[0:31:41] <sulkcessor> i agree so much
[0:31:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> so, my mother.
[0:31:43] <%Typhaeon> Give family more leeway than strangers, but know when to stop or get them professional help
[0:31:45] <MagnusCoolman> is this what RE7 was about?
[0:31:46] <daisyyyy> lol pats talking about my dad
[0:31:46] <%AnthroMetal> what are you, dominic toretto?
[0:31:48] <%WhereIsWill> preach!
[0:31:49] <%bendatron> then the racists
[0:31:50] <%maskofmichael> Fambly fambly fambly
[0:31:52] <%PirateMike_> Blood means something
[0:31:52] <Profmcstevie> I shall not be shackled to trash on the notion of "family"
[0:31:55] <%Thewoodentree> Can someone tell me what happened?
[0:31:56] <AtrusHB> Why is it that these recent "stronk woman" games (i.e. Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, TLOU2) seem to include gratuitous torture porn (ex: Tomb Raider trilogy's death scenes, everything Ellie goes through in TLOU2)?
[0:31:56] <%AnthroMetal> PAT IS THE ANTI DOM
[0:31:58] <%MaritimeSpanker> Fambly is the friends you choose and keep closest
[0:31:59] <%deviljhojho_> ItsIts real easy to say when you aren't born in a hardcore family matters clan tho
[0:32:04] <%SubjectTea> is this about real life or last of us 2?
[0:32:04] <@SSaryn> @curse85 essentially Pat just found his first 4 hours incredibly boring and kind of nonsensical in areas.
[0:32:05] <%SirGO0SE> the thing they dont tell you, is you can start new family
[0:32:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[0:32:08] <sulkcessor> @daisyyyy same. also fuck him
[0:32:08] <%Valdorick> Okay, life is a bridge. Normal people are wooden bridges, and family is a stone bridge... You can burn stone bridge down, and when you do, I'll be more willing to fix a wooden bridge than a fucking stone bridge.
[0:32:08] <$Dakuu75> 6,000 fucking dollars
[0:32:08] <SGrim> No, it's 6000 dollars
[0:32:11] <not_twitter_rowan> "Blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb" is the full saying
[0:32:12] <huetitle> Please pet the baby
[0:32:15] <%boomstickery> never" just" anything
[0:32:16] <%YakumoYomi> @MaritimeSpanker Real talk
[0:32:16] <ionands> R A C E W A R in woolies stream
[0:32:16] <%DappercatEsquire> It's just a thing I paid $6000 fuckin dollars on

[0:32:48] <%SirGO0SE> shes not paying bc she wants to be a cunt
[0:32:54] <$Dakuu75> yeah

[0:33:14] <ulricelderhart> @NeoCre Ah okay. yeah i got terrible family too so i get it.
[0:33:18] <Profmcstevie> "oh fuck my bad, I'll pay for that" all ya need
[0:33:20] <%Typhaeon> People have no common courtesy these days
[0:33:23] <@commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 29 month streak! Been playing Desperados 3, and I'd really recommend it. It's an isometric real time tactics/stealth game set in the Wild West. Fun writing, unique characters, and reminds me of games like Commandos.
[0:33:24] <%heartlesshealer> At least fucking offer a replacement for work purposes. Your sister's family unit is a poisoned well
[0:33:34] <%MaritimeSpanker> I'd also argue that the use of a computer can be vital in terms of paying bills and such like that
[0:33:35] <$Dakuu75> Your sister is a Karen
[0:33:38] <+cylish> cylish subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[0:33:38] <%Joustar_> truth.
[0:33:39] <%SirGO0SE> thats why kids are expensive fuck
[0:33:40] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt Often siblings don't respect each other too much.
[0:33:49] <%Gallhint> what the fuck did i join in to
[0:33:53] <%Nekros4442> Your sister is a Karen. Fuck it go Scorched Earth

[0:34:03] <TheLemuroid> Yo woolie just got btfo
[0:34:05] <+Delenay> if a dog broke/hurt someome its the others problem, whats the difference?
[0:34:07] <%WhereIsWill> his sister stole the shell in obra dinn
[0:34:07] <%logoth_> Scorch the earth
[0:34:08] <asurite_warrior> Dont know why I used an @ for that
[0:34:08] <Profmcstevie> It is WILD that some parents think "that's what kids do" is some umbrella excuse for bad behaviour. That's their "normal"
[0:34:11] <Energylegzz> Thanks for the PridePog @cylish
[0:34:14] <%YakumoYomi> Children make good kindling. Just sayin...
[0:34:18] <%haitakaa> pat is a Karen
[0:34:20] <+lupus_man> @patstaresat here reasoning is since I use it mostly for gaming I don’t need to replace it and need to grow up lol
[0:34:21] <ionands> Woolie got owned by facts and logic
[0:34:23] <%Joustar_> I really just want to go and get a vasectomy every time I hear child horror stories.
[0:34:27] <%Gallhint> @TheLemuroid are you one of those filthy jabbies?
[0:34:30] <%ssjklyco> The kid sounds like he might grow up to be a shitty person.
[0:34:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL

[0:51:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Man this forest sure is BLIND
[0:51:36] <thunderborn32> @sulkcessor yes
[0:51:41] <SGrim> It's a cohabitation between Ori and Glo-moss. The moss is eating Ori slowly over time. Ori's gruesome and slow death is the plot of the third game. PermaSmug
[0:51:41] <Zepper202> you think Ori's glowy now? Wait until you get to the second game
[0:51:43] <Shwepie> That feel when your neighbor calls their kids home and literally set the sky on fire.

[1:08:24] <WillyTheWendigo> Ori needs to switch to homing crystal soulmass, I don't think the heavy soul arrow is gonna cut it
[1:08:25] <%heartlesshealer> that was the only thing I wanted on it so far
[1:08:33] <%nosubstancex> You all can enjoy it! Just know that it was a stolen idea

[1:09:04] <KoyFoster> My energy :)
[1:09:14] <derekwst3> yellow is level up, blue is beam, green is health
[1:09:17] <StencilOST> crystals drob it
[1:09:19] <a_mad_dragon> it's dark souls. everything is souls
[1:09:19] <AtrusHB> SourPls
[1:09:25] <WyvernsArentDragons> some enemies, drop it, but usually it's from blue crystals that respawn upon area transition
[1:09:28] <+GenesisKnight> @koolaid_kevster he did it when the game first came out
[1:09:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Wrangler117 late tip: watch the elebows of enemies when they move towards you then parry and you'll get it 100% in DS1...but not in the others
[1:09:32] <hkgamingtv> nope
[1:09:33] <Zepper202> it's called the Light
[1:09:34] <SainEdge> there are crystals which also respawn
[1:09:35] <%Typhaeon> Jebaited
[1:09:35] <jowi_time> its tree juice
[1:09:36] <$insaneintentionsyo> I wanna see Pat insane120Skelecry
[1:09:48] <$RealThiele> i love the not enough keys sound on doors, smash that SFX
[1:09:49] <%heartlesshealer> It's cool @nosubstancex, I'm just personally tired of spending my money on scumbags now that I'm an adult and it's actually my money that I'm spending
[1:09:51] <StencilOST> square peg round hole
[1:10:18] <RinWR> Ori's about to fill them dark souls with LIGHT
[1:10:21] <not_twitter_rowan> that's the blue juice for saving
[1:10:24] <hkgamingtv> it gets more interesting once you get to the first "dungeon"
[1:10:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> no
[1:10:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> thye regen
[1:10:44] <StencilOST> Pat have you played will of the wisps? Or is this your first Ori?
[1:10:46] <%SirGO0SE> ya gotta pay the troll toll, to get in
[1:10:47] <hkgamingtv> no double jump yet
[1:10:48] <%valriot> Im sorry what?
[1:10:52] <$RealThiele> this has such a different feel from #2
[1:10:52] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> rekt
[1:10:53] <%ProfessorHotBot> howdy
[1:10:55] <%Starotter70> Gimme that leg boy
[1:10:55] <%Clundy> Clundy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:11:06] <%heartlesshealer> It's always sunny in philadelphia song
[1:11:16] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah cause you saved when you had 2 health
[1:11:22] <WyvernsArentDragons> you respawn with however much health you had when you made the save point
[1:11:23] <Profmcstevie> This game don't play around
[1:11:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nah
[1:11:26] <%ergulor> Yup
[1:11:29] <%heartlesshealer> All progress reverted
[1:11:31] <+Delenay> its like a life
[1:11:34] <%corgispudmen> yupo
[1:11:39] <+Delenay> resets certan progress
[1:11:39] <%ergulor> you go back to your last soul link
[1:11:41] <+lbCyber> death = rewind
[1:11:41] <+Cobaltor_252> you loose your progress ya
[1:11:45] <%heartlesshealer> Soul points are hard saves
[1:11:49] <+Delenay> but you can put it where ever you want
[1:11:50] <AtrusHB> save often :)
[1:11:50] <StencilOST> its a save point, not a respawn point
[1:11:50] <@SoFarFetched> always good to make save spots here and there so you don't lose too much progress.
[1:11:53] <ElenaManetta> i can't believe pat started the stream without me
[1:11:53] <%Chichen> dark souls
[1:11:53] <$RealThiele> they counter with easy saving
[1:11:58] <ElenaManetta> here i am, running errands
[1:12:01] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> This game seems really easy, where's that difficulty spike??
[1:12:04] <ElenaManetta> busy as a bee
[1:12:05] <koolaid_kevster> @genesisknight Thanks for letting me know and being helpful! great mods in this chat
[1:12:06] <%zestyArsenic> you died, how could you possibly remember how a map stone works
[1:12:20] <StencilOST> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh during dungeons
[1:12:21] <AtrusHB> [cutes in gibberish]
[1:12:22] <snakemuho> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh the first dungeon
[1:12:30] <hkgamingtv> it seems easy but it's not
[1:12:46] <$RealThiele> traps spoopy
[1:12:48] <snakemuho> yeah also it feels hard to control early on without upgrades
[1:12:48] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> When are dungeons?
[1:12:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> pat use checkpoints
[1:13:00] <+Cobaltor_252> you should save now
[1:13:10] <$RealThiele> saving is for chumps
[1:13:11] <%devanmuse> has anyone else noticed that "mm, delicious" has become pat's new verbal tic? just like "you know what i mean" and "excuse me"
[1:13:22] <Profmcstevie> Level up death blasts are Kreygasm
[1:13:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> if u dont checkpoint often youll get bodies
[1:13:44] <+Delenay> just save again?
[1:13:46] <%blastazoid26> mm delicious has been around for a while lol
[1:13:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> wall jump
[1:13:57] <StencilOST> i think getting these is also a hard save
[1:14:02] <SainEdge> AngelThump
[1:14:04] <hkgamingtv> saves use juice
[1:14:13] <+lbCyber> wall jump in this game is absurdly powerful
[1:14:14] <thunderborn32> what do you guys think about anime games having clothing with cleavage censored or straight up remove, while games like last of us 2 and witcher have straight up sex
[1:14:17] <+Delenay> save bro
[1:14:22] <Profmcstevie> More BLUE JUICE

[1:15:01] <+lbCyber> SAVE PAT
[1:15:10] <%SirGO0SE> pat really wants that boys hole tonight
[1:15:10] <%1matheuw> chill chat
[1:15:17] <hkgamingtv> saves use juice
[1:15:19] <Profmcstevie> A wall jump as a first ability is very pleasant, they get you moving QUICK
[1:15:22] <%valriot> BOI HOLE :EYES:
[1:15:22] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> who can i pay to toss both titty weebs and neil druckman into a briar patch
[1:15:23] <snakemuho> Pat isn't saving because he wants to keep the mana in case he needs it
[1:15:24] <Shwepie> A 0:13 save file means you likely go through the opening cinematic and stopped as soon as you hit the first save point.
[1:15:27] <StencilOST> lol
[1:15:28] <jobbedbone> Jesus saves, pat
[1:15:28] <hkgamingtv> but he has juice
[1:15:31] <+Delenay> juice is easy to get
[1:15:31] <%Joustar_> Saving is for the weak
[1:15:32] <$lotharrio> "If it's any consolation, I think the rape scene went over really well, Charlie."
[1:15:34] <%1matheuw> the funniest part od the stream is watching pat horribly fuck up
[1:15:35] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:15:38] <BrocktopusRah> Pay it to get innnnn!
[1:15:41] <+lbCyber> There is a wealth of juice

[1:16:30] <BrocktopusRah> “Are you chewing gum?!”
[1:16:30] <%SirGO0SE> gotta pay that troll toll, to get in @masterfire23
[1:16:31] <%Joustar_> You don't need to save if you're good Kappa

[1:27:56] <StormingRLP> With retrograde ejaculation, the bladder neck muscle doesn't tighten properly. As a result, sperm can enter the bladder instead of being ejected out of your body through the penis. Several conditions can cause problems with the muscle that closes the bladder during ejaculation

[1:39:48] <%heartlesshealer> But also saving is important
[1:39:59] <$RealThiele> "but what if i also never save"
[1:40:02] <Profmcstevie> Curse this multiple draws on the same resource mreeeeh
[1:40:04] <thunderborn32> @PatStaresAt every ability in the entire game uses save juice and there a road blocks requiring ability use, so there is at least a bare minimum you have to use to progress
[1:40:04] <%PanicSwytch> There are tons of those breakable walls
[1:40:06] <%DedlokPM> time to acquire more save juice
[1:40:06] <%walternatorz> save the juice
[1:40:18] <%AnthroMetal> why tho
[1:40:23] <+BeezusHrist> i've been working in the flea market so early...

[1:40:58] <%Starotter70> Paige has glasses?
[1:41:02] <+BeezusHrist> Just because the rhythm is slow, that don't mean you can't flooooow.....
[1:41:08] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie Holy shit yeah. Though I figure since the allergies stress me out, it's basically the same. Not to mention the confusion with Corona-chan.
[1:41:11] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> damn, dawg, inappropes
[1:41:12] <%Typhaeon> Life on the outside isn't what it used to be
[1:41:13] <%Daxalog> They sound like you
[1:41:14] <%SvenHolgersson> THE TWINS
[1:41:18] <jobbedbone> its like the moonanites but more european
[1:41:18] <$lotharrio> Sort of like nasally Euro-trash.
[1:41:23] <%Daxalog> They sound like you singing about the British Children
[1:41:33] <%Typhaeon> I really liked the art style and tone of Superjail
[1:41:35] <%PanicSwytch> Orb and the blind Peach
[1:41:36] <%ergulor> it was great
[1:41:39] <$insaneintentionsyo> drugs
[1:41:42] <%LaughingCatt> thats shows a delightful drup trip
[1:41:44] <penitentpentwitch> It felt like it was going for a 'Ren and Stimpy' vibe

[1:42:00] <%Agami23> superjails fucked
[1:42:01] <%YakumoYomi> Alice is a treasure
[1:42:02] <hkgamingtv> in super jail you get super raped
[1:42:05] <%TomFrank> really gory too
[1:42:08] <+Remery_> Not as bad as Mr. Pickles
[1:42:10] <emptyennui> Pat what would you do if your descendants found your VODs in to the farflung future (Twitch has become the vidya brothel house and thus can run well into the dystopian cyberpunk future)
[1:42:13] <%Bt_Robot> Has Woolie ever played this? Ths game is 99% crazy platforming challenges.
[1:42:16] <%heartlesshealer> but yeah, superjail was a weird feeling
[1:42:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger First time I took sinus pressure pills for the headaches, it cleared up within the hour, and I was convinced it was magic.
[1:42:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You're laughing while wondering what am I watching?
[1:42:16] <%SvenHolgersson> Search Results Web results Ballmastrz: 9009 is better tho
[1:42:17] <%Starotter70> Did they pull their teeth out?
[1:42:19] <%optimasmaximas> @rufus2k2 who's that?
[1:42:24] <$lotharrio> Don't Hug Me I'm Scared is difficult to get through.
[1:42:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DHMIS is traumatic
[1:42:32] <hkgamingtv> get the health one
[1:42:34] <Ipsenscastle> The furthest toward Ren & Stimpy I will tolerate is the Angry Beavers. I'm a coward.
[1:42:43] <thunderborn32> you dont need hp until you need it
[1:42:44] <ProfessorLitmus> willy wonka jail
[1:42:56] <jobbedbone> guys I need help workshopping this joke: Orby and the blind
[1:42:59] <%Agami23> DHMIS is scary but not exactly the amount of soul damage superjail is.
[1:42:59] <%bevyrage> If you enjoyed Superjail, might I suggest you to watch a series made by the same people called Ballmastrz. Imagine Superjail but with a more cohesive episodic adventure and it's got bloodsports as the main focus.
[1:43:00] <%YakumoYomi> @Ipsenscastle Not even Ripping Friends?
[1:43:02] <+NitronStreams> oh no
[1:43:04] <%rosemon5001> map is the best early game pickup easier to lvl
[1:43:04] <%rufus2k2> @optimasmaximas Character from SuperJail episode it was a very unique episode from the usual stuff
[1:43:07] <%DappercatEsquire> Gross Stinger
[1:43:11] <%vectorless_peon> superjail was rad and weird AF
[1:43:12] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> One hit remaining
[1:43:14] <%Blargimazombie> Oh hey thanks for the sub
[1:43:16] <%heartlesshealer> I see Pat is choosing the slow levels path of ability expansion. Kinda refreshing and annoying at the same time?
[1:43:22] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie Yeah. Unfortunately my body built an immunity to them. All of them. Even Benedryl won't so much as make me a little sleepy anymore.
[1:43:26] <narusao> did you break the elmo?
[1:43:28] <%walternatorz> it's against the law
[1:43:30] <Ipsenscastle> @YakumoYomi I'll be honest I dont know what that is
[1:43:34] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> "if you're crazy, tell us"
[1:43:35] <thunderborn32> @PatStaresAt elmo are you a cop? you have to tell us if your a cop
[1:43:41] <koolaid_kevster> im watching remnant vod now widepeepoosad

[1:43:48] <%SirGO0SE> NARC
[1:43:48] <narusao> elmo is the strong silent type
[1:43:48] <+lbCyber> Defund Elmo
[1:43:49] <ToneBacas> LUL
[1:43:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ELMO IS A NAC
[1:43:53] <%MidnightBurst12> what a mysterious boy
[1:43:53] <%heartlesshealer> psaWink
[1:43:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NARC
[1:43:56] <%Daxalog> Cats cant be cops.
[1:43:57] <%ergulor> Cat cop
[1:44:00] <%Jay_Squirrel> no way elmos a cop, hes a good boy
[1:44:00] <%Starotter70> Elmo's not a Narc
[1:44:01] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat's a sovereign citizen
[1:44:01] <%SvenHolgersson> THEN HES COMPLICIT
[1:44:02] <%Jamejarrs> Elmo would never be a cop
[1:44:02] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Must not be a cop then
[1:44:05] <%DappercatEsquire> Elmo cannot arrest
[1:44:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger That sucks. I hope you got something to help, at least.
[1:44:06] <%Jamejarrs> He's too pure
[1:44:06] <%a_c_chirns> tomatoKnife tomatoDisgust a cop?
[1:44:07] <%SvenHolgersson> GET EM
[1:44:08] <SainEdge> jail it is then
[1:44:16] <Profmcstevie> All Cats Are Bussies
[1:44:17] <hkgamingtv> emlo is a narc
[1:44:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt BTW the cops do no have to tell you if you are a cop
[1:44:22] <%DedlokPM> Only thing Elmo has to tell us is if he is a cop. psaGib rooComfy
[1:44:23] <%SvenHolgersson> DEFUND ELMO
[1:44:24] <+Remery_> Elmo would sell us out for Catnip
[1:44:28] <ToneBacas> do cops really need to do it?
[1:44:29] <%YakumoYomi> @Ipsenscastle It's essentially Ren and Stimpy, starring a team of burly men instead of a cat and dog
[1:44:31] <Ipsenscastle> Elmo is as much of a Cop as Cop Dog is a Cop and not a Ghost
[1:44:42] <thunderborn32> @doc_ock_rokc its from a movie captain obvious
[1:44:42] <jobbedbone> "Orby and the blind mistress" is close phonetically but its a stretch
[1:44:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYYEYE
[1:44:48] <$insaneintentionsyo> yay
[1:44:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie Actually, the one good thing to come from Corona-chan is that the mask helps keep pollen away from me lol.
[1:44:56] <%Bt_Robot> Are we really at All Elmos Are Bastards now?
[1:44:57] <%BubbaRands> AEAB All Elmos Are Beautiful
[1:45:05] <Ipsenscastle> @YakumoYomi well I do like teams of burly men
[1:45:07] <%Joustar_> Undercover cop Elmo, stealthily investigating baby-puncher Paige for evidence
[1:45:07] <Tucker0603> this really reminds me of Kindred from League of Legends
[1:45:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @thunderborn32 Yes but people don't know that cops can lie to you
[1:45:10] <%za7az> Yay!
[1:45:17] <%Typhaeon> I wish Blasphemous was as big as Hollow Knight
[1:45:21] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:45:24] <@SoFarFetched> I can kinda see that.
[1:45:25] <%Emperor_Machinus> and hollw knight
[1:45:26] <%PanicSwytch> Agree
[1:45:26] <%LaughingCatt> aeroShocked
[1:45:28] <%heartlesshealer> Is it because it's gun-based?
[1:45:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> EVEN FUSSION?
[1:45:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger Silver linings, I suppose. Stay healthy
[1:45:29] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt What about Prime?
[1:45:32] <MSN04_Sazabi> Is Blasphemous the one made by Spanish people with all the Catholic imagery?
[1:45:33] <%BinaryFireball> @PatStaresAt play TimeSpinner you will love it me thinks
[1:45:34] <%mike2hands> WHY?
[1:45:35] <%Warbot40> Fair enough I guess
[1:45:35] <%SvenHolgersson> THE BABY
[1:45:36] <Ipsenscastle> That's a good reason to not like Metroid
[1:45:36] <+BeezusHrist> Do you like Metroid Prime?
[1:45:37] <%mike2hands> OH
[1:45:39] <%valriot> YEAH IT IS
[1:45:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I only like Fusion
[1:45:41] <chaumiester> Goblins?
[1:45:43] <+lbCyber> Also Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an even better experience, and has Hollow Knight combat
[1:45:44] <%SvenHolgersson> BUT WHAT ABOUT
[1:45:45] <$insaneintentionsyo> 4 WILL COME EVENTUALLY
[1:45:45] <%MisterRockett> Metroid's combat is probably the least interesting thing about Metroid I'll admit.
[1:45:46] <+Jake_Protagonist> maybe you just gotta try super again
[1:45:46] <%SvenHolgersson> THE BABY
[1:45:47] <SummonerMagno> Pat doesnt like female protags
[1:45:48] <%YakumoYomi> That's fair
[1:45:51] <%rosemon5001> SACC
[1:45:51] <%a_c_chirns> whens metroid prime playuthrough?
[1:45:51] <%dinnydanny777> Those walls are gross
[1:45:52] <%Daxalog> hat about Prime Hunters. The bestest one
[1:45:55] <StencilOST> hollow knight is more like a Iga-vania x souls
[1:45:56] <jobbedbone> damn I need a new metroidvania to binge BibleThump
[1:45:57] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Prime Trilogy LP sometime?
[1:45:58] <penitentpentwitch> Shooting was a bit limited in the original, had the directional shooting problem early games had
[1:45:58] <%logoth_> The fan metroid 2 remake is the shit
[1:45:59] <hkgamingtv> AM2R is fucking awesome
[1:45:59] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie Thanks, you too. Wild times we live in.
[1:46:01] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Hey, can anyone in chat tell me why I can't find the Tomb Raider (2013) game on the playstation store?
[1:46:02] <derekwst3> metroid isnt my fav either, but i love these types of games
[1:46:03] <Xelhesia> ughhhhh
[1:46:05] <%Warbot40> Super Metroid's control scheme is a bit awkward.
[1:46:07] <%valriot> Metroid hasnt really evolved or caught up to a lot of these games, cos...fuckin nintendo wont make another
[1:46:08] <%SvenHolgersson> That's hot ngl
[1:46:09] <%Typhaeon> Touch the cocoon
[1:46:12] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the 3ds remake of metroid 2 is pretty solid, the parry adds a lot to the combat loop
[1:46:14] <%Starotter70> Need to try Prime out with a control scheme that doesn't fuck up my arm
[1:46:15] <+BeezusHrist> Metroid Prime 4 is going to be the shiiiiiit
[1:46:17] <%YakumoYomi> Stop climbing that sac, Pat
[1:46:18] <thunderborn32> @PatStaresAt your going to love ori 2 its just more hollow knight
[1:46:18] <Phrickshun> I sure hope we get a sequel to Bloodstained
[1:46:21] <%SvenHolgersson> Hundreds of spider orbs

[1:47:47] <Phrickshun> Oh shit, I didn't know there was an announcement for curse of the moon, that's something at least

[1:48:36] <hkgamingtv> ur a nerd
[1:48:37] <Dr_Angelic> like this game you can save frequently
[1:48:38] <penitentpentwitch> When in doubt, move the checkpoint closer
[1:48:40] <californaya> sounds like someone needs to improve their skill level, if you know what I'm saying
[1:48:41] <hkgamingtv> so save
[1:48:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Use protea's 4
[1:48:43] <+crimsonharvest> o good cause hard is just bullshit its unfair enough as is lol

[1:48:50] <%SvenHolgersson> NERD
[1:48:50] <@SoFarFetched> Better strap ourselves in and get some food guys,might be here a long while.
[1:48:53] <+lbCyber> cops don't save
[1:48:53] <jobbedbone> you might need those save points later pat
[1:49:05] <%heartlesshealer> no, Pat just forgets to save. He would never last trying to use art programs
[1:49:06] <hkgamingtv> pats a cop
[1:49:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SoFarFetched way ahead of you
[1:49:11] <penitentpentwitch> Didn't this have an achievement for never dieing?

[1:50:02] <%heartlesshealer> now go back
[1:50:02] <%Starotter70> Thanatos?
[1:50:04] <%KaiserMario> This is made using Unity, right?
[1:50:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> You got the thing
[1:50:16] <+lbCyber> @KaiserMario yep
[1:50:30] <hkgamingtv> purple water = bad
[1:50:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah Hornet sucks
[1:50:47] <a_mad_dragon> not yet anyway Kappa
[1:50:47] <hkgamingtv> save the deku tree
[1:50:49] <%Typhaeon> Grape drink DansGame
[1:50:51] <%SirGO0SE> corruption is dank
[1:50:52] <Saltmeisterr> thats not mark brown
[1:50:52] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Woolie
[1:50:52] <%KaiserMario> @lbCyber Do you know if the sequel is too?
[1:50:54] <$lotharrio> Yeah but purple is GROSS
[1:50:55] <thelonechris> Hey, some of my best friends are spiders
[1:50:59] <jobbedbone> I've seen orange its sick
[1:51:00] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> oh it's goopy mario water
[1:51:00] <Saltmeisterr> thats the other guy
[1:51:01] <%dukenux> yeye GMTK
[1:51:01] <%Nupinoop296> purble good
[1:51:01] <Ipsenscastle> Woolie colours
[1:51:01] <Shardlab> True
[1:51:01] <penitentpentwitch> That's probably the biggest thing to get used to in this game, because you control where checkpoints are you have to get in the practice of setting them up. That upgrade that gives you a free HP for setting them up that helps make the habit.
[1:51:02] <%Starotter70> Purple Stuff
[1:51:04] <%ergulor> purple green and rarely orange
[1:51:06] <%dinnydanny777> Purple is often chaos or entropt
[1:51:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Purple is royalty too, so it works
[1:51:09] <thunderborn32> @PatStaresAt purple works since it doesn't exist our eyes just suck
[1:51:10] <tubit> black
[1:51:11] <ExpressNode> Basically any cool color
[1:51:11] <%SirGO0SE> nature isnt cool enough for purple
[1:51:12] <%optimasmaximas> just looked for that vid and found nothing, rip
[1:51:13] <+trekkie11041> reminds me of dark eco
[1:51:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Purple is a very cool color in art heory
[1:51:14] <%dinnydanny777> Purple is often used to represent chaos
[1:51:14] <%YakumoYomi> People associated purple and green with "sickness", I guess
[1:51:14] <Saltmeisterr> the gaming for a non gamer guy
[1:51:14] <+lbCyber> @KaiserMario Yep, same engine
[1:51:16] <%dukenux> it's either green or purple
[1:51:16] <Profmcstevie> So rare it's pigment was reserved for royalty
[1:51:16] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> AND RED IS EVILLL
[1:51:19] <%Emperor_Machinus> Sigma Virus is purple
[1:51:20] <MSN04_Sazabi> Woolie also doesn't occur very often in nature Kappa
[1:51:21] <Shardlab> And when it does, it's long dead diseased tissue
[1:51:22] <%IncredibleMeh> I think that was a different channel from GMTK
[1:51:22] <%elchizzou> Orange was great for hollow knight
[1:51:23] <Ipsenscastle> Hollow Knight uses that orange well
[1:51:24] <%dukenux> proving that Woolie is down with the devil
[1:51:26] <%Jaxnos> that ability point blow up is the best
[1:51:27] <Shwepie> It occurs when you're beaten and brused.
[1:51:31] <hkgamingtv> get the keystones pat
[1:51:36] <usurper_sos> Save the game
[1:51:36] <%SvenHolgersson> You need to go to doctor if that happens
[1:51:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I LOVE BEING PURPLE
[1:51:39] <+wjones0415> flower?
[1:51:41] <hkgamingtv> there are four
[1:51:42] <%SirGO0SE> same :) purple gang
[1:51:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Profmcstevie no reserved but only royalty could afford it
[1:51:45] <Ipsenscastle> Dragon Age has red corruption
[1:51:46] <%ssjklyco> Ori-fus
[1:51:47] <Shardlab> Or poisonous stuff advertising "Purple says Do Not Fuck With Me."
[1:51:49] <%dukenux> Red is either EVIIIL or health+
[1:51:50] <%Emperor_Machinus> mine too
[1:51:51] <%Typhaeon> Royal purple
[1:51:55] <%heartlesshealer> purple is the dye color of royalty
[1:51:55] <%Nupinoop296> i love how Pat yelled "FUCK YEAH" right as my grandma walked by, the unknowable timing
[1:51:56] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> not even purple PepeHands @ellie
[1:51:57] <+Kurt_0> woolieF woolieU
[1:52:00] <%KaiserMario> @lbCyber Thanks
[1:52:01] <Ipsenscastle> I'm partial to sickly pale green
[1:52:05] <ExpressNode> I hate blue
[1:52:07] <hkgamingtv> save the deku tree
[1:52:11] <%Starotter70> What's bottom tier?
[1:52:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So Pat is actually Pat Star.
[1:52:14] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt that was Razbutem not GMT
[1:52:16] <Tucker0603> orange, blue, then green for me
[1:52:17] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie You're green on my screen.
[1:52:22] <%SirGO0SE> turkwise
[1:52:25] <%Typhaeon> Puce
[1:52:26] <thunderborn32> @PatStaresAt purple doesn't exist our eyes just suck and say must be purple to anything they dont understand
[1:52:27] <%dukenux> Green is my favorite, then blue
[1:52:29] <%SirGO0SE> he LOVES turkwise
[1:52:35] <%Emperor_Machinus> Purple > Red > Grey / Brown
[1:52:35] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Army green is cool though
[1:52:36] <+ATentacleMonster> SMT4A protag BTFO
[1:52:36] <Xelhesia> i hate brown
[1:52:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger Oh shit I've been found out
[1:52:37] <Saltmeisterr> yellow honestly
[1:52:38] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Teal is underappreciated as a color
[1:52:41] <+crimsonharvest> where are you going
[1:52:41] <jobbedbone> Hyper Light Drifter was so colorful it was allowed to get away with black for corrupt stuff
[1:52:42] <%JD_Lars> Orange
[1:52:42] <Dreigun> my favorite and least favorite colors are different shades of green
[1:52:42] <%Ranger747> my favorite
[1:52:43] <hkgamingtv> you can't but stomp the post yet
[1:52:43] <+crimsonharvest> go back up nerd
[1:52:43] <JonnyJug> Neon yellow
[1:52:44] <Profmcstevie> Queen Elizabeth 1 forbode anybody but close family to wear it, I think it has some history of social limitations @doc_ock_rokc
[1:52:48] <%elchizzou> The color for corruption should be named "Woolie Green"
[1:52:49] <%SirGO0SE> pls say turkwise
[1:52:49] <+lbCyber> purple is a weird colour because it's not on the colour spectrum
[1:52:51] <derekwst3> yellows tend to be on my bad list
[1:52:55] <Teras_ode> like just the green or camo in general?
[1:52:55] <%SirGO0SE> i will clap
[1:52:58] <ToneBacas> so Fallout 3 color palette
[1:52:59] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt So you don't like Naked Snake Olive Drab?
[1:52:59] <%dukenux> Green can be either beautiful or fugly
[1:53:02] <derekwst3> Amber is good though
[1:53:05] <hkgamingtv> save the deku tree
[1:53:10] <+wjones0415> yellow is never evil!
[1:53:16] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie I like how you can close the stream, open it again, and have a different colour.
[1:53:18] <ExpressNode> Green is my favorite then probably purples. Dark shades of those colors I like, lighter shades or neon I dislike.
[1:53:20] <thunderborn32> @lbCyber its basically error 404 color not found for our eyes
[1:53:22] <+lbCyber> yellow is pee though
[1:53:26] <%SirGO0SE> yellow is the cthulu color
[1:53:31] <katocrimson> pat will never camoflague
[1:53:33] <%dukenux> @wjones0415 what about the Yellow Bastard
[1:53:34] <%SirGO0SE> pee is cthulu liquid
[1:53:34] <thelonechris> Yellow is the color of Hastur
[1:53:36] <%dukenux> or King in Yellow
[1:53:40] <+Kurt_0> woolieCHAN
[1:53:40] <%DedlokPM> @SirGO0SE But what about turquoise? mogsHmm
[1:53:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I've found that green with more blue than yellow in it is best. That's why I only like green haired characters like Deku's hair

[1:54:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Each color has both a positive and negative connotation with it. I think that's beautiful.

[1:54:57] <masterfire23> pokemon news and square avengers
[1:54:57] <%MidnightBurst12> ehh
[1:54:58] <MegaXZerolegends> Snap was great
[1:54:58] <%D00msDayDan> there's a pokemon puzzle game coming out on thursday on switch and mobile
[1:54:59] <+ATentacleMonster> Unless it's for the new Pokemon Snap no
[1:55:00] <%YakumoYomi> A lot of people are speculating that it will just be about the Tencent project
[1:55:02] <%PanicSwytch> Pokémon Go 2?
[1:55:05] <%Ranryu692> New Pokemon Snap, though
[1:55:07] <%Daxalog> Its probably an update to their mobile game
[1:55:07] <%Starotter70> Pokemon Snap is unironically the most exciting thing in the franchise for a minute
[1:55:07] <Profmcstevie> Can't wait to wake up for Lets Go Johto or whatever
[1:55:09] <%SirGO0SE> Paige would know, she's a Vulpix

[1:55:17] <%dukenux> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:55:20] <%colouroftheiris77> Did they catch all the Pokemon Go cheaters that shut down the game for a week?
[1:55:20] <usurper_sos> Gotta catch some of them
[1:55:21] <reddpop_> its the easiest call in the world
[1:55:21] <Ipsenscastle> Pokemon Snap is the best pokemon game, I'm amazed they finally rebooted it
[1:55:25] <%pectusumbra> To be fair Paige, it's been about 20 years
[1:55:26] <%Emperor_Machinus> Who else is excited to consume!
[1:55:28] <SleepyMaribo> @PatStaresAt to be fair, the dlc for pokemon is everything the main game should have been... holy shit i made myself sad saying that out loud...
[1:55:29] <penitentpentwitch> She just wants you there
[1:55:30] <%BubbaRands> Maybe it's that MMO I wanted...
[1:55:33] <%Typhaeon> Pat can only be Pat

[1:55:35] <@SoFarFetched> THREE
[1:55:36] <madskull456> Gotta catch a few
[1:55:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I will only buy Pokemon if they release an official Dating Sim. Because I'm filthy shipper trash
[1:55:40] <Profmcstevie> Pat had a good standing for that, Snap had no sequel for decades
[1:55:43] <%SvenHolgersson> IS IT REGGIE
[1:55:44] <%SirGO0SE> FeelsBadMan

[2:16:39] <%derap41> Did he take Fig Jam from her fridge?
[2:16:40] <cellularmishap> no, just shove the popo back up your anus
[2:16:41] <%walternatorz> a colostomy bag defeats the asshole
[2:16:43] <%InugamiTheHound> does anal prolapsed count as a win or loss?
[2:16:48] <+lbCyber> "haha it looks like I shit the bed I win"
[2:16:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat has the right idea
[2:16:48] <jobbedbone> I would have asked to see the jar
[2:16:50] <%worldbrand> How... how would you get it in there? With your fingers? With a spoon? Was a funnel involved?
[2:16:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @derap41 at the risk of sounding like I'm missing a meta joke, I started the thing off with a reference to Auntie Donna who makes hilarious skits on YouTube, one of which is the Christmas Pud.

[2:39:40] <Mister_McDerp> the crunch of exoskeletons
[2:39:41] <WyvernsArentDragons> Beenut butter

[2:41:00] <+Remery_> Paige and Insects
[2:41:03] <$lotharrio> @FoolsArcade Because she thought he could trust him.
[2:41:03] <%BubbaRands> WHY UNCA SCROOGE
[2:41:05] <+unknowingchuck> remember that time page said bagels are horrible
[2:41:05] <%SirGO0SE> food association is real

[2:41:37] <@SoFarFetched> @razielhex the smell of fear
[2:41:39] <$RealThiele> Hes tougher than the toughies, smarter than the smarties, and trollier than the trollies
[2:41:40] <+darthfodder> Canned corn reminds me of a bad part of high school involving my ex girlfriend.
[2:41:41] <%YakumoYomi> I get it. Instead of food, music and video games are the things I form strong associations with
[2:41:41] <%Joustar_> the same woman that can chug mustard without even breathing ladies and gentlemen.
[2:41:45] <%BunnyEmperor> the duck basically summoned the egyptian plagues upon Paige
[2:41:46] <+NitronStreams> Food is important for living so negative association is a survival technique
[2:41:46] <%SvenHolgersson> I mean pickles still remind me of watching The Land Before Time for the first time

[2:55:19] <Mister_McDerp> but bees are nice!
[2:55:21] <%JJCheeker> My relationship with ants was burning them w/ magnifying glass
[2:55:21] <+crimsonharvest> Paige hates the useful bugs but loves a pest like ants
[2:55:23] <%BinaryFireball> centipedes?
[2:55:26] <derekwst3> beetles?
[2:55:26] <%SvenHolgersson> Ants are one of the few creatures that commit warcrimes Paige
[2:55:26] <%worldbrand> i feel the opposite, i dig most of the predators
[2:55:26] <%JD_Lars> “I love worms” psaSmug
[2:55:28] <%iosephe> And house centipedes

[2:55:43] <+Angrec> scrooge?
[2:55:45] <JonEWorldbeater> How would you feel about gummi worms in your burger?
[2:55:46] <%heartlesshealer> Thanks for the PrideHeartL @kid_flashionable
[2:55:49] <Shwepie> Paige hates worms because she is afraid of them in her McDonald's, makes sense. Nope, Paige loves worms, she isn't afraid of eating them, but hurting them.

[2:56:07] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Dreigun Yeah, I had a similar experience. Spent like 200 bucks on ant traps and they stopped bothering the neighborhood ever since.
[2:56:07] <%SvenHolgersson> He made so much money off that bet

[2:57:27] <King_Wolf_Rigger> ticks are the worst. shit will kill you
[2:57:29] <%Joustar_> I don't want to see another tick in my life.
[2:57:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yes u do
[2:57:31] <Sunstalker> I have a combo horror for Pat and Paige. I was making a peanutbutter sandwich once and there was a centipede like bug that was in the factory sealed jar that was transperent white and still alive. D:
[2:57:31] <Xelhesia> time stop plus bamf = epic
[2:57:33] <+darthfodder> Many of us watch Pat and Woolie primarily for the off topic conversations along the way.

[2:57:34] <%worldbrand> we absolutely have at least three species up here

[2:58:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> its wheb
[2:58:40] <thunderborn32> @PatStaresAt congrats you just discovered how to kill the next boss pat
[2:58:42] <+crimsonharvest> Deer are vermin and its not an exaggeration
[2:58:43] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt it's like rickets but you get eat from not eating the whole deer
[2:58:43] <Camail> deer get WASTED
[2:58:44] <TheLemuroid> It's horrifying basically Mad Cow
[2:58:44] <%Newbert> Scrapie?
[2:58:45] <FairOnFire> deer are fucking disgusting
[2:58:45] <Ipsenscastle> What is this disease hole you crawled out of
[2:58:45] <%MidnightBurst12> ZOMBIE DEER
[2:58:46] <%derap41> Deer a freaking nasty
[2:58:47] <%Joustar_> [ PLEASE EXPLAIN]
[2:58:48] <+Angrec> @PatStaresAt there is also a tick that can make you deathly allergic to red meat (lone star tick)
[2:58:48] <%tumzfestival> that's no good...
[2:58:50] <%worldbrand> If you dont get Lyme treated fast enough, you're kinda fucked
[2:58:53] <+BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt Wasting deer disease is simply mad cow disease. We call it CJD in humans
[2:58:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ALL ANIMALS
[2:58:53] <%SvenHolgersson> I AM NOT GOOGLING THAT
[2:58:54] <%Promessa_EX> and that's why you shoot them, they are horrible
[2:58:55] <ExpressNode> Oh fuck and I ate deer as a kid
[2:58:56] <%SvenHolgersson> NOT ONE BIT
[2:58:57] <+Grayhammatter> how's pat enjoying ori?
[2:59:00] <%TheBenson8r> Pat lounging like that is everything I needed in life right now
[2:59:02] <$lotharrio> I like how complicated this game is getting.
[2:59:03] <%BubbaRands> Deer are disgusting creatures
[2:59:04] <%optimasmaximas> happens to moose and elk as well apparently
[2:59:04] <%Mekhet09> It's mad cow for deers. Currently, considered nontransferable but it ruins the meat.
[2:59:04] <%derap41> Deer and Rabbits are disgusting
[2:59:05] <King_Wolf_Rigger> And you can't cook it out of the deer either
[2:59:05] <%LadyTheWanderer> i get lots of deer in my backyard
[2:59:06] <%ChrisPlaysThing> what about the flesh eating bacteria?
[2:59:08] <+darthfodder> Basically, their flesh falls off
[2:59:10] <%ergulor> Isn't that the zombie deer decease?
[2:59:10] <%Newbert> Prion diseases in general are the worst
[2:59:12] <%arancet> dont catch the consumption
[2:59:20] <%spiritofmojave> fucking yikes
[2:59:21] <%rosemon5001> collect stuff while you can pat
[2:59:23] <Winner_92> this game is awesome and once you get this ability it gets really awesome
[2:59:24] <%Pyroclase> Lupus may be a horrible tragic disease, but at least it has a cool name?
[2:59:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> I still lay awake at night worrying about priaprisms.
[2:59:25] <%SvenHolgersson> BUT IT SOUNDS SO MUCH WORSE
[2:59:31] <TheLemuroid> Would you take your chances
[2:59:33] <%Newbert> Same sort of thing as Fatal Familial Insomnia
[2:59:33] <%optimasmaximas> @PeachSaliva apparently it happens to moose and elk too
[2:59:34] <Mister_McDerp> venison is great
[2:59:34] <%LadyTheWanderer> rabbits taste AWESOME
[2:59:35] <%Joustar_> @Angrec I had to sleep out for a week with those around. NOT FUN.
[2:59:41] <Mister_McDerp> elk is the best tho
[2:59:42] <$MachoMadnesss94> whyy is pat skipping all the secrets/collectibles?
[2:59:44] <Deimos002> LAMB Kreygasm
[2:59:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Venison is so good. So is bison and bear. Bear is one of my favourites.
[2:59:45] <@SoFarFetched> Shepards Pie? PogChamp
[2:59:46] <%Promessa_EX> make some gyros
[2:59:47] <%tumzfestival> My last dog died peacefully in his sleep at a very old age. That's always what I wanted, when i had to think about it. He was OLD.
[2:59:50] <+Delenay> the lamp lets you do it again
[2:59:51] <thunderborn32> its annoying to prepare since you have to add fat to the meat
[2:59:52] <%spiritofmojave> this is why i love chicken which no disease has EVER come from fowl :)
[2:59:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LAMB IS GOD TIER
[2:59:57] <%derap41> Moose is best meat
[2:59:59] <%Afterman_> gyros yum yum
[3:00:01] <+moonseas4> lambchops yum
[3:00:03] <@SoFarFetched> that works too
[3:00:04] <%Ranryu692> Did you know that lamb is vegetarian?
[3:00:04] <%SirGO0SE> i miss eating lamb :( i gave it up
[3:00:08] <+Grayhammatter> cottage pie Kreygasm
[3:00:09] <%Metballs> I miss lamb burgers
[3:00:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Lamb is definitely up there.
[3:00:11] <%heartlesshealer> 👏
[3:00:12] <+BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt Wasting deer disease came from commercial farming of deers. Animal rendering which is feeding animal byproduct to animals, and in this case, feeding grinded up deer to deer. This is why commercial selling of Deer is illegal in the United States now
[3:00:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @spiritofmojave hahaha of course
[3:00:15] <TheLemuroid> I was eating lamb earlier
[3:00:17] <%spiritofmojave> lamb is tasty
[3:00:17] <+darthfodder> Yum Gyros.
[3:00:17] <Camail> 1st try
[3:00:18] <Ipsenscastle> lamb is baby though :(
[3:00:18] <%LadyTheWanderer> ive never had deer before
[3:00:20] <TheLemuroid> good stuff
[3:00:20] <%Pyroclase> "I have ground lamb, it's right here in my pockets!"
[3:00:22] <%Metballs> Haven't had a good one since moving home
[3:00:24] <+lbCyber> Rabies is still the most terrifying contractible disease
[3:00:28] <$Ziegsy> @SoFarFetched add some HP sauce? *chef kiss*
[3:00:31] <%arancet> beesus rises
[3:00:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> cottage pie is shepherds pie with beef instead of lamb.
[3:00:37] <%Promessa_EX> i think it's really interesting how deer horns go crazy after an injury and it's satisfying to see it corrected
[3:00:40] <$Ziegsy> COTTAGE PIE IS SHEPARDS PIE. JUST WITH BEEF
[3:00:43] <%tumzfestival> makes sense
[3:00:44] <%JD_Lars> Pat love lamb and onion powder from grandma
[3:00:44] <%SirGO0SE> D:
[3:00:44] <$lotharrio> ...so it's a prion disease?
[3:00:44] <%Typhaeon> Same thing with mad cow
[3:00:45] <$Dakuu75> holy shit
[3:00:45] <Mister_McDerp> so hunting is good
[3:00:46] <%seanaramicus> Paige what if there are worms in mustard?
[3:00:46] <Ipsenscastle> Oh, cannibalism prion stuff
[3:00:47] <%Blargimazombie> Ah, prions
[3:00:48] <JonEWorldbeater> So, Paige, how would you feel if every time you eat deer it might be Bambi's mom?
[3:00:51] <%derap41> @BeezusHrist holy shit we're fucked up as a species
[3:00:52] <%tumzfestival> isn't mad cow like that?
[3:00:53] <$Dakuu75> wait, do ppl get sick if they eat ppl?
[3:00:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> eww
[3:00:59] <%Ranryu692> Wendeergo
[3:00:59] <Profmcstevie> Cannibalism bad? Damn
[3:01:01] <TheLemuroid> Just like mad cow
[3:01:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> @lotharrio it is a prion yes
[3:01:03] <King_Wolf_Rigger> maybe we shouldn't feed animals themselves.... maybe
[3:01:06] <Shwepie> Mad Cow Disease also came from feeding cows to cows.
[3:01:08] <+BeezusHrist> @derap41 Yeah :(
[3:01:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHY WOULD U FEED DEER, DEER?
[3:01:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> HP SAUCE is gross. like ketchup and catsup.
[3:01:16] <%derap41> hey fun fact we feed Chicken to Cows and Cows to Chicken
[3:01:16] <+darthfodder> Yes, people get sick if they eat people.
[3:01:20] <+darthfodder> Especially brains.
[3:01:21] <%Promessa_EX> when you eat people, your immune system doewsn't attack it at all so it's real bad
[3:01:24] <%tumzfestival> @TheLemuroid Kk, thank you :)
[3:01:24] <+BeezusHrist> Yes, mad cow disease came from feeding cows to cows
[3:01:27] <+FilthyHereticHorus> mmm Long Pig
[3:01:30] <%spiritofmojave> couldn't a prion emerge in drinking water and just kill you at any waking moment
[3:01:33] <%tumzfestival> WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED?
[3:01:38] <$spardanwarrior> Is that the plot of Last of Us 3?
[3:01:39] <%LadyTheWanderer> you get prions if you eat human brains
[3:01:41] <jowi_time> GOOD LUCK PAT!!

[3:01:51] <+Grayhammatter> NICE LINK
[3:01:52] <%xxshadowxx416> but human taste good psaDab
[3:01:53] <%zeif00> That just reminds me of that guy that ate that other guy and kept part of him in his freezer
[3:01:53] <+lbCyber> the reason we don't eat carnivorous animals is because they carry a shit ton of zoonotic diseases and parasites
[3:01:55] <penitentpentwitch> Challenge mode is go!
[3:01:55] <%CarrowayFashonti> Pat, you are on record saying you would eat a person
[3:02:00] <%Mekhet09> Prions diseases are insane. They literally cause protein to misfold, and then it transfers to all future protein formations which is why it can't be cured.
[3:02:03] <+BeezusHrist> It's the brain and spinal fluoids. You can't eat the brain and spinal fluid of your own species...
[3:02:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE

[3:02:31] <%Promessa_EX> supposeddly human is pretty good, brain would probably be tasty
[3:02:32] <%derap41> @BeezusHrist also liver and kindeys are a bad idea
[3:02:33] <Ipsenscastle> The higher up the food chain you go the more crazy diseases congregate in one place
[3:02:36] <%ladomania> If eating people is so bad then why do kings eat ass
[3:02:36] <%LadyTheWanderer> taste like bbq

[3:14:58] <penitentpentwitch> This part is not kind to OCD completionism
[3:15:00] <%miabyte> this was legit the worst part of the game for me
[3:15:03] <+NitronStreams> Such a lust for ORB
[3:15:05] <%arancet> this is what pat has to deal with every time paige is thinking about papyrus
[3:15:07] <JonEWorldbeater> Gotta get dat orb
[3:15:07] <%JD_Lars> Not worth it
[3:15:08] <%AncelDeLambert> what if orb but cube?
[3:15:08] <%SirGO0SE> Reminder for Pat: re-enable raid notification
[3:15:14] <Streetshark_> whooooooooooooo

[3:15:43] <+neutralraff> the water marbles.......gross.
[3:15:44] <%skylerpilot> its like Arby's but they serve orb
[3:15:45] <%Agami23> knowing how nice pat is, he would probably do some real degenerate shit like let paige use his lap as a pillow.
[3:15:46] <%spiritofmojave> good thing this music loop is super good huh LUL

[3:15:54] <raveous> he fragile
[3:15:54] <%Clundy> Welcome to The Orb Shaming Hour, starring Orb and Mustard Queen with special guests Elmo and Steve Buschelmo
[3:15:59] <%JD_Lars> Music in these games is great
[3:15:59] <%Dementedpenguin> I hate how fast the water catches up even when you go fast
[3:16:01] <%AncelDeLambert> ... CUZ IT'S TWENTY HUNDERD TONS OF IT, PAT!
[3:16:01] <Shwepie> It's full of wood.
[3:16:03] <%moogleboy1984> All Furries are weak to water
[3:16:03] <+darthfodder> Arby's: It's food?
[3:16:04] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt refraction index destroys Ori PogChamp
[3:16:05] <Streetshark_> because water bending is OP
[3:16:07] <$lotharrio> Light diffuses weirdly in water.
[3:16:07] <%Ranryu692> different refraction angle than air, so it would scatter Ori's photons?
[3:16:13] <Streetshark_> those fuckers can boner bend
[3:16:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS A FLOOD PAT
[3:16:13] <Slimeking_Mike> Water Refracts Light

[3:16:23] <JonEWorldbeater> That show with the shitty alien narrated by Leslie Nielsen
[3:16:24] <zamzoph> @klattmose wow, that's more generous than I thought. I figured they'd just reset the sequence
[3:16:25] <+Minauros> the greed
[3:16:25] <+darthfodder> Arby's: It's not everyday food, but once every few months...
[3:16:35] <Ipsenscastle> poor baby
[3:16:39] <californaya> That sounds like a personal problem, Pat.
[3:16:45] <%worldbrand> did you know if you fall into the wake of a weir (dam barrier) the flow can make escape 100% impossible and you just drown spinning forever
[3:16:47] <vadnhi> "Honey. It's the full moon. Time for your 12-hour Blood-bending erection..."
[3:16:49] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt the worst part is i dont do it good and then fuck it up

[3:27:35] <%Midashu> only snake can have dummy thicc
[3:27:37] <%Fooguwu> unbalanced ass
[3:27:42] <%worldbrand> his clap made him too easy to detect
[3:27:42] <@commanderclaw> Nerf the ass, buff the tier
[3:27:43] <Sunstalker> If the ass doesn't quit, you must aqcuit
[3:27:45] <Profmcstevie> That ass idea is great we'll use that for pachinko....but patch it out of this please
[3:27:46] <$lotharrio> "People keep sending us tweets about daddy-Pyramid Head."
[3:27:49] <+YelloGek> On the good-news side, you can still have all of that whilst using the other skins!
[3:27:49] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> the clapping was giving him away
[3:27:49] <%SirGO0SE> -2
[3:27:49] <%abakkus> the clapping of his cheeks kept alerting the survivors :/
[3:27:49] <$insaneintentionsyo> dummy thicc
[3:27:49] <$jarednotwithsubway> PH is terrifying to play against
[3:27:50] <+neutralraff> go from brioche to pan pizza dam.
[3:27:57] <%MechArch> can hear them cheeks chasing you
[3:27:59] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> when will japan stop its crusade against thicc ass
[3:28:00] <TheLemuroid> Japanese hates asses
[3:28:03] <$Ziegsy> You could hear PH coming by the sound of his cheeks slappin' they HAD to change it
[3:28:06] <+Minauros> pyramid head was dummy thicc
[3:28:07] <+YelloGek> The other skins, so far, retain it all.
[3:28:07] <%Pookiedaexzile> THis is why Yoko is a maverick
[3:28:09] <%SubjectTea> the clap of his ass kept alerting the guards
[3:28:10] <rpnm991> Pat if you read this tell paige I hope she’s doing better since her last stream!
[3:28:12] <%realm_forge> The sound of its clapping gave him away
[3:28:13] <%derap41> I'm trying to murder survivors but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my asscheeks keeps alerting them
[3:28:17] <%BubbaRands> Japan and their obsession with flat asses
[3:28:22] <+Vithaeria> this game is great but it gives me terrible headaches, not kidding.
[3:28:24] <+Minauros> the clap of his cheeks was alerting the survivors
[3:28:25] <vadnhi> Also, the generators of Pyramid Head's stage have also been replaced with Pachinko machines...
[3:28:25] <$lotharrio> Turns out that, much like Snake, PH was TOO dummy thicc.
[3:28:29] <%spiritofmojave> meanwhile Nintendo is inflating a new ass with every game
[3:28:31] <%DensityD> Pat is playing the pretty game, and this game is so pretty
[3:28:31] <$RealThiele> air biscuits
[3:28:34] <Ipsenscastle> Why does Japan want to deflate all the asses?
[3:28:40] <AtrusHB> @KingVantq I think Pyramid Head's model in Dead By Daylight had an accidental THICC ass, and the devs nerfed it when they realized
[3:28:43] <Profmcstevie> down in the air
[3:28:43] <+lbCyber> just tap down when in the air

[3:28:58] <%de1ete_forever> this is really important, we need to know the patch note
[3:29:04] <$RealThiele> just make the japanese version of the game have his butt pixelated
[3:29:05] <TheLemuroid> Is that for real about the clapping cheeks. Sounds like a joke.
[3:29:05] <%Ranryu692> butt bounce
[3:29:10] <SparkAfterDark> oh no, it would be so inappropriate if a silent hill 2 enemy was weirdly sexual in design
[3:29:15] <Ipsenscastle> First they came for our asses. What's next?

[3:52:01] <%Monkeyweed21> IGN has apparently gotten much better in the last couple years after those shithead editors left
[3:52:01] <lexicon0214> wait, is the story of him getting people kicked out fake or nah?
[3:52:05] <%worldbrand> yeah it's like when someone's evil dunk on them for being a stupid jackass and what they did, not like, what they are
[3:52:05] <Shwepie> Nope.
[3:52:24] <%Agami23> @optimasmaximas he is the azure dragoon. he is important to the dragoon plotline and the first expansion of ff14, heavensward. he is a little bitch also.

Since Pat and Paige were really interested in trying to figure out the stuff themselves.

[4:04:30] <Top_Lane_Duelist> Esports Lovers Organization
[4:04:32] <%Taisuru> ELO is a ranked matchmaking system

[4:04:47] <%MayorRev> hidden
[4:04:50] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt yes, hidden. It's your matchmaking rank
[4:04:53] <%Jekado> ELO is derived from Chess
[4:04:57] <$RealThiele> hidden dick energy
[4:05:00] <Jtf374> fair enough
[4:05:03] <$insaneintentionsyo> this may take only two streams
[4:05:07] <%Jekado> ELO is a ranking system orginally used in chess i think
[4:05:13] <%walternatorz> eloquent
[4:05:19] <%AncelDeLambert> I have NO clue, I never saw what it mean
[4:05:22] <%TheBenson8r> Electric Light Orchestra, probably

[4:05:41] <KasiCrafter> ELO used to be visible, but people were toxic about it, so they got rid of it.
[4:05:43] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt pretty sure it's some sort of ranking thing in games
[4:05:43] <jowi_time> its named after a person
[4:05:45] <%brickwall35> a name
