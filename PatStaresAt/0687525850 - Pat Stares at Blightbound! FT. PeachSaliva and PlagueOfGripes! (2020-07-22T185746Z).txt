[0:03:32] <%derekwst3> i had panda express yesterday, and i still feel sick from it..... :(
[0:03:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @elredacto I second this notion.

[0:15:22] <LordOfThePoultry> KappaPride
[0:15:23] <boomstickery> it doesnt work
[0:15:24] <+LinkyBinky> @phantomsleeves Yes, from what I understand if you want to continue after 60 you have to get the game which raises the max to 70 and gives you a free month, I still believe. Then to get to 80 you have to get Shadowbringers.

[0:36:43] <brian_peppers1> Pat can you ask ELI why he likes FURRY PORN so much?
[0:36:46] <Dead_trickster> I remember starting the game as Pugilist/Monk back when Heavensward was new. I miss that version of it.

[0:47:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 my baby brother just walked into my room carrying the dog and wished to trade her for money for his car insurance. I pointed out that I hated the dog, but he could take one of my uncashed checks. he left the dog in my room and closed the door as I was yelling for him to take the dog too.

[0:49:06] <Solokaldaka> crreamHi chat
[0:49:06] <%emperordread> I jerk off to furry porn but don't own a suit or go to cons, am I a furry?
[0:49:07] <star_feline> That makes plague eligible for being a furry 🤔
[0:49:08] <%YakumoYomi> I'm not a furry. Unless...
[0:49:08] <%DappercatEsquire> It's not about the furry on the outside, it's about the furry on the inside
[0:49:09] <%Piemen99> Hell if I know
[0:49:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You can just like the characters. Or you can do the freaky shit
[0:49:10] <%realm_forge> Plague isn’t a furry he just wants to fuck all of them

[0:50:06] <leinadtonu> can you wear a headset on a furry suit?
[0:50:09] <+TheMidnightDeacon> Plague is just a marketing genius, profiting from furries
[0:50:09] <%moogleboy1984> Furries merely adopted (heh) the Adult Baby lifestyle

[1:03:21] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 so, pat and plague have a similar relationship to me and one of my friends, just the rapport of us saying the worst stuff to each other cause it's how we show affection. Also: paige would deffo sacrifice her subs, *because she'd be turning us into skeletons*
[1:03:22] <%Movemeister> Not enough for the DEEP SOUTH
[1:03:22] <+Ches_Neckbeard> There's also Literally Southern Pat
[1:03:23] <%mike2hands> indeed deep south
[1:03:26] <+krymzen5> i say tht every time i watch u nd paige stream

[1:04:24] <Coystick> I live inside an unused Google Stadia
[1:04:24] <gsoto83> I wish I had a house boat... I wish I had a home... I'm gonna die broke and alone...
[1:04:25] <+krymzen5> Cajun is the best seasoning blend tho

[1:57:53] <%DensityD> a minor thing, try to not direct the laser beam towards your allies
[1:57:54] <+pectusumbra> because she's a DPS of course

[2:02:39] <TheDestinyPotato> This game's art style is really cool but I'm not big on the animation

[2:03:21] <%indig0bird> They look cool
[2:03:22] <%joylent_blue> @PatStaresAt someone said you unlock character select after doing some early game stuff
[2:03:24] <%JenovasPuppet> You need to press F to switch characters. F to pick up, F to attack, F to everything!
[2:03:42] <+TopTieramisu> pat turned big
[2:03:52] <restingbones> is this a sponsored stream? Or a free game?
[2:03:56] <+TopTieramisu> velstadt
[2:04:07] <%DensityD> HEY It's that My Hero Aca character, because they have a belly button laser
[2:04:07] <%srkAres> i wish the mailman would fucking ring twice
[2:04:10] <JonnyJug> To whom the bell tolls
[2:04:12] <%CzeekyPlays> @restingbones sponsored
[2:04:12] <%Skelegroove> Blocking off character select until later is a terrible idea
[2:04:14] <@SoFarFetched> Pat was given the game and it was like "hey you can stream this if you wanna"
[2:04:34] <%CzeekyPlays> @restingbones oh shit I mean free? I think
[2:05:16] <Profmcstevie> I don't know if I'd enjoy Carrion purely by mouse&Keyboard so good for Carrion
[2:05:20] <cherrycottontail> Pat did you ever think you might just not like M+K controls and view 'merely okay' controller support as great?
[2:05:27] <%joylent_blue> i guess the thinking is to get the player familiar with all the classes, but the player shouldn't be forced into that imo
[2:05:34] <AngryPhant0m> its not "m" or "tab"
[2:05:37] <%JenovasPuppet> Map button is F, obviously.
[2:05:38] <restingbones> I mean, it might be neither. It just didn't strike me as a game pat would play, and noone sounds much interrested in the game either.
[2:05:41] <%ChestMimik> Probably 12
[2:05:45] <gsoto83> I like this are style

[2:06:20] <%CzeekyPlays> CzeekyPlays subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! yay 2 months thanks for content during these trying times
[2:06:25] <%clockworknate> paige is like that friend you invite over because their mom talked to your mom and just tries to run any fun you have .
[2:06:26] <Profmcstevie> Someone broke Paiges ass in game, wow
[2:06:26] <iosephe> Map is in the top right by the way
[2:06:27] <restingbones> appearently this is an early acces game. So yeah I guess Pat got a code.

[2:07:21] <bigbrothergannon> lol
[2:07:25] <restingbones> Pat, between you and paige? I am certain you are squishier.
[2:07:25] <%ChestMimik> Isn't that DPS in general?
[2:07:29] <%Laecerelius> no mana for heals
