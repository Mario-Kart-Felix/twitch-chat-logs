[0:33:38] <ammobasket> He was on the train the whole time!!!
[0:33:40] <rufus2k2> @RyuuAoi she already ripped off DMC4
[0:33:40] <%d1stantutopia> FUCK OFF DAD YOU RUINED MY THEME MUSIC
[0:33:41] <%BoxNavy> dmc has a good narrative at least

[0:33:47] <%the22cstomp> it's bad good

[0:33:54] <+It_sjustjoey> DMC is ART
[0:33:55] <Vyneci> Yeah, I only understood what the fuck happened after going through it like 4 times
[0:33:57] <thelonechris> So bad it's good or just plain bad?
[0:33:57] <Laecerelius> I still am like "Yup, that sure was a story"
[0:33:58] <%chibicheezit> so the yakuza of sexy dame gamea

[0:34:10] <Droozy01> so much sass just to get off the train lol
[0:34:11] <%the38bandit> how tall is bayo?
[0:34:11] <%Ipsenscastle> i still maintain DMC3 has one of the best videogame stories, especially delivery wise
[0:34:13] <+PleasantLee> freak out the ghost humans by breaking shit
[0:34:15] <%Aydarkzero> why are people just glass people now?
[0:34:15] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Property damage
[0:34:17] <pokefan9956> something something something angels
[0:34:18] <Whensmahve1> Pubic hair witch fights the legions of God
[0:34:20] <%BoxNavy> they are nothing
[0:34:21] <Laecerelius> Things that will never be used
[0:34:22] <alvaroeltz> i mean, i remember the history of pretty much all dmc games, bayo 1 on the other hand
[0:34:22] <Mvrdok_> I mean, She can do whatever mvrdokUh
[0:34:23] <Rekinsinn> ???
[0:34:23] <ullyzeez> pat is a bitch ass hoe
[0:34:23] <%twistedj3ster> it's fine
[0:34:24] <+thegreenbenis> WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT, it's a nice ass
[0:34:24] <pilllowofbees> The people here are big wtf?
[0:34:25] <+DemonScratch> Bayonetta 1 makes the really weird choice of being the second half of a time travel storyline where the character who has already lived through the first half doesn't feel the need to explain shit
[0:34:26] <Broken_Sonex> To be fair, it is a VERY big ass.
[0:34:26] <%jorniev> WORKS FOR ME
[0:34:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> It feels cringe not cheesy good to me
[0:34:28] <%d1stantutopia> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:34:29] <%mister___doctor> The plot of these games is that Bayonettas booty doesnt quit
[0:34:29] <%Dakuu75> I think they're heals and stuff
[0:34:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> a mistake
[0:34:29] <KeiPrime> items?
[0:34:30] <Louie_Salmon> Oh my god is it here too
[0:34:30] <%wydamn> they're just ingredients
[0:34:31] <simplyvince15> yeah DMC'S story is a masterstroke compared to Bayo
[0:34:31] <filialpails> when you have a big ass and like to strut you'll take any excuse you can get
[0:34:32] <%honeyman18> I've played this for years and just realized her nips were poking through her suit
[0:34:34] <hamborgini> alchemy reagents to make consumables that you'll never use
[0:34:34] <DrkJP520> You mix 'em into lolipops
[0:34:37] <@SoFarFetched> yeah you make the lollipops and st uff
[0:34:42] <+SilverDevilfish> You are now realizing Bayonetta's backstory has more in common with DmC: dmc Dante then real Dante
[0:34:42] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt You use them to make healing items and shit
[0:34:44] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt now we just need Bayo to show up in the new Shin Megami Tensei to explain the stop in japan.
[0:34:49] <@SoFarFetched> which kamiya docks points off you for being a coward and using items
[0:34:50] <Rekinsinn> Kreygasm
[0:34:50] <%saadi90> You make lollipops
[0:34:51] <+thegreenbenis> Pat is just jealous of Bayonetta's ass
[0:34:51] <%Aydarkzero> wasn't the the same reason they had for revelations 3ds to show off Jills ass?
[0:34:53] <pokefan9956> is it even clear if God even exists in bayonetta? pretty sure they only have, like, high ranking angels
[0:34:58] <%Alazull> Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme baby!
[0:35:00] <Whensmahve1> They’re for the dorm invasion side quests
[0:35:04] <+PleasantLee> this the pc version?
[0:35:28] <RyuuAoi> NUDITY, KIDS
[0:35:38] <+thegreenbenis> Wasn't she originally naked, or did I misremember?
[0:35:38] <+stupidsquid> isnt bayo self aware and doesnt take itself srsly?
[0:35:41] <%SGrim> Chat, how old were you when you realized the guns are called Scarborough Fair because they represent Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme?
[0:35:43] <%VoidBaronJules> @PleasantLee switch version cause bayo 2
[0:35:43] <BleedinActionMan> @pokefan9956 God is 100% a thing
[0:35:45] <%joeobo2> partial nudity
[0:35:51] <BleedinActionMan> @pokefan9956 Kind of...
[0:35:52] <Whensmahve1> Oh it’s like the sync attacks from Astral Chain
[0:35:54] <rReizs> triangle, is this the ps3 version ehehehe
[0:35:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Some mods make her.....more nude during attacks
[0:36:00] <Broken_Sonex> Pat is just jealous that Bayo's ass can't quit unlike his
[0:36:00] <%FacetiousAF> 🤔 shit i thought it was 3 dodges not 5
[0:36:04] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> It's weird to hear PS button names for a series that never got the good PS ports it deserved :\
[0:36:04] <%twistedj3ster> @SGrim I was right now years old
[0:36:06] <%d1stantutopia> @SGrim literally the first time I played this game in like 2011

[0:36:33] <rufus2k2> which version is this, Switch?
[0:36:34] <%SGrim> @d1stantutopia I got some of them. LUL
[0:36:38] <DrkJP520> Also enemies don't stun as easily as in DMC, so that helps
[0:36:42] <%d1stantutopia> Dodge Offset is the fucking best and it should be in every character action game ever
[0:36:42] <$KnivesEve> I hate that I can't find a new copy of bayo2 anymore
[0:36:43] <Sain_127> happy new years if i dont catch you tomorrow
[0:36:44] <justachap> Bayonutta
[0:36:48] <+thegreenbenis> Bayo is actually only 5'4, she just looks giant compared to Pat.
[0:36:54] <Laecerelius> I like how her shadow has the wings
[0:37:03] <%rainbowthrashed> Sick
[0:37:07] <Hydrapissed> yehh
[0:37:07] <rytisone> kinda
[0:37:08] <%SGrim> As she should be
[0:37:10] <Hydrapissed> shes big
[0:37:10] <+Over_ninek> little bit
[0:37:10] <%cvp5127> good
[0:37:10] <%AzureGale> Yea
[0:37:11] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[0:37:11] <%d1stantutopia> @SGrim I went through a phase as a teenager where I was big into local folklore, so I knew about Scarborough Fair before Bayo came out
[0:37:12] <Louie_Salmon> She is a little shaky
[0:37:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Eww Switch
[0:37:13] <%BoxNavy> are you as good at this as you are dmc? @PatStaresAt
[0:37:13] <rufus2k2> yeah everybody except Joe Pesci is taller than Bayo
[0:37:13] <%twistedj3ster> You're crazy no matter the answer
[0:37:15] <%Ranryu692> yeah totally
[0:37:16] <primaryfire> it does and she is
[0:37:16] <pokefan9956> it looks like she really has to take a shit
[0:37:18] <Mvrdok_> It's the heels
[0:37:19] <+PleasantLee> yeah, I never liked her run animation. its awful
[0:37:19] <+It_sjustjoey> Its a heavy ass
[0:37:20] <Broken_Sonex> It is a VERY big ass, to be fair
[0:37:21] <%weissguard> She's a bit hunched over.
[0:37:21] <%Aydarkzero> looks a little awkward
[0:37:21] <ARDM112> That ass ruined many lives
[0:37:24] <%AkronymCLT> She looks like she's rushing for the bathroom
[0:37:24] <@SoFarFetched> also her shadow is madam butterfly
[0:37:25] <Hydrapissed> also the heels lol
[0:37:26] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Well, that or her massive legs
[0:37:30] <%Visorak6> It looks like a I need to shit run
[0:37:30] <Sain_127> pat you are crazy independently of her ass
[0:37:30] <marvel877> Have YOU tried running in HEELS?
[0:37:31] <%Ne1son> That ass ruins all our lives @PatStaresAt
[0:37:33] <+Totally_Not_Toby> IT'S BEEN
[0:37:33] <Fear_Ranjer> SHE LOOKS LIKE JERMA
[0:37:34] <+thegreenbenis> Maybe if she didn't run at 20 miles an hour in heels. @PatStaresAt
[0:37:34] <himbearbedtime> Legs are too long
[0:37:34] <Droozy01> too thicc
[0:37:35] <LVL1_Scumbag> Can't say I had that impression
[0:37:35] <%notsoy> i mean, she's got a LOT of ass
[0:37:35] <pilllowofbees> The price of being dummy thucc
[0:37:37] <%weissguard> Well, she's leaning into it, rather.
[0:37:37] <zehjojo> That ass is ruining my life
[0:37:40] <Zealion27> damn
[0:37:41] <%jorniev> RUNNING ON HEEELS
[0:37:42] <%SirGO0SE> she has an ass so big it'd fit in Warframe
[0:37:48] <BleedinActionMan> OH
[0:37:49] <%BoxNavy> dont worry chat will backseat you
[0:37:51] <Fear_Ranjer> Jerma and his large dumptruck ass
[0:37:52] <+Totally_Not_Toby> jermaThing jermaThing jermaThing
[0:37:53] <%FacetiousAF> damn, 2009
[0:37:54] <RyuuAoi> RUST IS REAL
[0:37:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> amazing
[0:37:59] <+Over_ninek> PLEASE DO KEEP TALKING
[0:38:00] <Sain_127> havent seen this game in yeeaaars
[0:38:01] <BleedinActionMan> I had no idea you could go up here
[0:38:01] <Laecerelius> With all the crazy backtracking secret missions in this game it's understandable
[0:38:03] <Buttku> ive never liked her run animation, i thought i was crazy
[0:38:05] <MrDoomtastic44> this was a fun find in the demo back in the day
[0:38:09] <Estuko> @Totally_Not_Toby that facial expression will always make me laugh
[0:38:11] <Bladethrine> @patstaresat If I heard right you can also offset with taunts
[0:38:18] <%SGrim> @d1stantutopia I played in a Irish Folk band in middle school. I thought it was an easy connection, but every Bayo stream I mention that gets somebody.
[0:38:24] <RyuuAoi> THIS IS BASICALLY DMC SPIN OFF
[0:38:25] <Rekinsinn> why do you have 22k rings?
[0:38:31] <+PleasantLee> ....explain
[0:38:33] <%Aydarkzero> better dmc2? LUL
[0:38:35] <Estuko> @Buttku for honor PeaceKeeper run NotLikeThis
[0:38:37] <+Over_ninek> ahaha
[0:38:40] <Broken_Sonex> When you think about Jerma is just male Bayo
[0:38:40] <%Ranryu692> I prefer Itsuno's take
[0:38:43] <rytisone> The train is leaving Hogwarts
[0:38:43] <TheSphereHunter> this is a very good gaem
[0:38:43] <+Over_ninek> look at that jank LUL
[0:38:46] <Sain_127> cant even remember how this ends
[0:38:47] <DrkJP520> omg so you did end up playing dmc2 after all
[0:38:52] <Louie_Salmon> Wait really
[0:38:53] <BleedinActionMan> @Rekinsinn 22k is basically nothing
[0:38:57] <Hydrapissed> man wonder who the director was for dmc 2 lol
[0:38:58] <TheSphereHunter> yea this is the spiritual sequel to DMC1
[0:39:01] <Hydrapissed> will never know
[0:39:01] <%Ipsenscastle> it has the same kind of dedicated dodge as DMC2
[0:39:03] <Sain_127> its like brand new at this point fm
[0:39:05] <Zealion27> oh damn didn't know that
[0:39:06] <Whensmahve1> Pretty sure it’s also in an alternate post-DMC1 universe
[0:39:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FFS CAPCOM GIVE US DMC X BAYONETTA GAME
[0:39:12] <chron121> ***
[0:39:13] <bleugh> ninja gaiden is also kind of a dmc2
[0:39:14] <%joeobo2> never knew that about the train
[0:39:18] <rufus2k2> Itsuno came in super late to DMC2's development
[0:39:20] <+Over_ninek> yea even tonally this really DMC1
[0:39:21] <+RealPT1> Bayo and DMC also share continuity at least through enzo
[0:39:29] <Rekinsinn> @BleedinActionMan Well I wasnt paying attention, did he get those from breaking shit?
[0:39:29] <%Aydarkzero> @BallerSwagBro9k just watch the death battle Kappa
[0:39:36] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> When I got the train to move I thought it was cause I wasted too much time.
[0:39:40] <rufus2k2> I still wish Itsuno would've brought back Lucia for DMC5
[0:39:44] <marvel877> Also has the same sort of color palette.
[0:39:45] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt There is concept art of Dante playing strip poker with Enzo
[0:39:49] <RyuuAoi> Oh hell yeah
[0:39:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @aydarkzero I did
[0:39:50] <+Kullnes> pat do you prefer dmc1 or dmc3??
[0:39:56] <Sain_127> are the graphics better for the switch?
[0:40:05] <Whensmahve1> Pretty sure Eve is even named dropped in this
[0:40:08] <primaryfire> getting hit once in bayo 2 is enough to drop a rank
[0:40:11] <%BoxNavy> dmc1 is its own game imo
[0:40:13] <thelonechris> Das a big key
[0:40:15] <%SirGO0SE> but dmc 2 is baest gaem
[0:40:15] <%AkronymCLT> DMC1 still has that RE atmosphere
[0:40:16] <CSeriesJTYPE> I started DMC with 3 and I cant really get into Bayo
[0:40:18] <RyuuAoi> Combo here too doe
[0:40:18] <%joeobo2> keyblade
[0:40:19] <%Valdorick> DMC wants you to style on enemies. Bayo wants you to not get hit and do big number.
[0:40:20] <+SilverDevilfish> And now it's Kingdom Hearts
[0:40:22] <%rainbowthrashed> So are there a ton of really niche secrets in this?
[0:40:22] <%Aydarkzero> @BallerSwagBro9k you see the season finale was real good
[0:40:24] <rufus2k2> suddenly, ABBA
[0:40:25] <%SGrim> Spoken like a GS player.
[0:40:25] <fran031> God, i love this OST
[0:40:25] <ullyzeez> lmao jumped like a bitch
[0:40:26] <pokefan9956> the fact that you get to fight with the key is great
[0:40:26] <%Dakuu75> "biased AGAINST damage" what do you mean?
[0:40:27] <+trackles_64> meteor was the bes tin this gamew
[0:40:27] <%Andrizzleton> Hey Pat any leaks...leaky pipes? Leaky Bayo 3?
[0:40:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> A Bayo/DMC game would PRINT CAPCOM MONEY
[0:40:30] <%d1stantutopia> the instant DMC jump lol
[0:40:31] <Vyneci> YEAH IT HAPPENED TO ME TOO
[0:40:32] <+Over_ninek> fuck
[0:40:32] <Whensmahve1> Is Pat using the pro controller?
[0:40:33] <Hydrapissed> PP gone
[0:40:34] <%SirGO0SE> reset
[0:40:34] <%BoxNavy> :(
[0:40:36] <rytisone> no PP for Pat
[0:40:37] <+Over_ninek> start over
[0:40:37] <+Kullnes> still to play three myself, im currently playing through hard on dmc1 first time myself
[0:40:37] <+PleasantLee> restart the game
[0:40:37] <juxtest> Bayonetta was the first Keyblade Master
[0:40:40] <professorno> In bayo "style" is kind of a necessity while it's an option in DMC
[0:40:44] <filialpails> RESET
[0:40:44] <%EmanXLR> reset
[0:40:45] <+SilverDevilfish> Is Bayonetta a Xehanort Kappa
[0:40:48] <penitentpendant> Oh well, aim for just Plain Platinum
[0:40:50] <+Totally_Not_Toby> run over
[0:40:53] <%RoggleJr> RoggleJr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hello Pat! Have fun and stay safe.
[0:40:53] <ullyzeez> you are NEVER gonna get a pure plat outta the gate Pat
[0:40:55] <RyuuAoi> Bitch time
[0:40:55] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I played DMC2 the other day and now I 100% understand why a lot of people would have abandoned the series before playing 3. The awful combat is not even the worst part of that game.
[0:40:56] <LVL1_Scumbag> You will never have Bayo's pp
[0:40:58] <Sain_127> yeah the OST for this game is p fucking good
[0:41:11] <BleedinActionMan> @Dakuu75 In DMC, you can get hit and still get a good ranking. Not the case here.
[0:41:16] <+RealPT1> which has to be a weird copyright dodge to use a character from capcom but was only in the novel so capcom might not have any design rights on enzo
[0:41:21] <justachap> I always thought Bayonetta was made by the same team that made DMC
[0:41:29] <Hydrapissed> bayo is a cleave lord the lock on seems odd at times
[0:41:31] <@SSaryn> You can get away without lock-on a lot in Bayo yeah.
[0:41:38] <%notsoy> the DMC1 director, maybe
[0:41:38] <bettysharkface> I really like the aesthetic of these games, but I hate the gameplay. It's so frustrating.
[0:41:39] <+itsgundamu> !uptime
[0:41:39] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 41m 51s.
[0:41:40] <+Kullnes> what are the key differences between bayo and dmc? only played dmc
[0:41:46] <%d1stantutopia> @justachap some of the same team, but at a different company
[0:41:49] <%Valdorick> @Whiskey_T_Foxtrot The story? Trash. The level design? Trash. The weapons? Lengeth of Sword. The Bosses? I guess the final boss is okay?
[0:41:49] <hamborgini> I heard him say "gerbalism"
[0:41:52] <mister_z_1994> @justachap At the very least they're created by the same guy
[0:41:54] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Bayo's got a soft lock system, so I never do hard lock on ever
[0:42:03] <+rbakervv> @Kullnes the biggest one is a dedicated dodge button
[0:42:04] <RyuuAoi> FUCK IT. Imma play along, Pat. Thank you!
[0:42:05] <paralars_> also funny how you can just buy Royal Guard as an upgrade
[0:42:15] <%Andrizzleton> But where are they Ayame kunai with messages?
[0:42:18] <KeiPrime> vigrid and vigoor sound similar too
[0:42:18] <+Over_ninek> i mean DMC flirts with fake ass European cities alot
[0:42:22] <Louie_Salmon> Do these actually matter at all?
[0:42:24] <%Dementedpenguin> Oh man. Somehow forgot about the city stages in NG
[0:42:27] <rytisone> diary of Dante
[0:42:27] <%BoxNavy> the block in this game is real good
[0:42:30] <+itsgundamu> @Kullnes Bayo has more defense options than DMC like dodge timestop, and a little faster paced imo
[0:42:32] <Calek> TONY REDGRAVE
[0:42:34] <penitentpendant> Fake European Cities give you artistic license for architecture. Being ostentatious AND unrealistically grandiose.
[0:42:34] <+Kullnes> @Kullnes is that sbout it? i alwys figured thered be a ton of small stuff
[0:42:38] <%Dementedpenguin> I haven't played that game since its Xbox launch
[0:42:47] <Mvrdok_> Sounds like it
[0:42:48] <RyuuAoi> It's Dante?
[0:42:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:42:50] <Whensmahve1> “Bri’ish?!!?”
[0:42:52] <Sain_127> huh...
[0:42:52] <mike2hands> is this the tekken 7 reporter?
[0:42:53] <%FacetiousAF> honestly i thought it was luka's dad
[0:42:59] <Vyneci> But Pat, that would imply that Dante fucks and Luka is his son
[0:43:00] <+rbakervv> @Kullnes oh there is, that is just the biggest difference
[0:43:07] <%AkronymCLT> No Dante was a fan of Antonio Redgrave's articles
[0:43:08] <rytisone> Dante is Lucas father
[0:43:10] <mycoldshoulder> I find this game much more fast paced than dmc, especially on non stop climax
[0:43:11] <penitentpendant> Relearning Curve is go!
[0:43:19] <+Kullnes> @Kullnes ahhh right thanks, that makes sense
[0:43:20] <%tinyswampthing> i doubt dante could write remotely that cohesively
[0:43:21] <%AkronymCLT> I think that was the thing Kamiya said
[0:43:26] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Dante may or may not be canon in Bayonetta, as there is concept art of him in the Gates of Hell, playing poker with Enzo
[0:43:26] <pokefan9956> witch time is the coolest looking
[0:43:28] <+Over_ninek> Question: Is Paige an Umbra Witch?
[0:43:28] <s1rcuit> remember kids: angels are NOT your friends
[0:43:30] <%Bluwizard21> Bluwizard21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! I've heard you talk about how playing games on a television can burn the screen, but are there any reprecussions for playing a console on a desktop monitor?
[0:43:33] <Mvrdok_> @PatStaresAt Tony Redgrave is the alias used by Dante in the novel Devil May Cry novel by Shin-Ya Goikeda
[0:43:33] <Whensmahve1> Dmc4’s haiku scene proves Dante knows what sex is tho
[0:43:41] <RyuuAoi> Take your time @patstaresat WE IN HERE
[0:43:45] <tanarath> Pat, Redgrave is another person that Dante idolized, so he took his name after the journalist died.
[0:43:45] <hawkhollywood> its luka's dad and dante just respected him so much he borrowed his name to honor him as I recall
[0:43:53] <penitentpendant> @Over_ninek Yes, but she's untrained and keeps cursing herself
[0:44:04] <+itsgundamu> Also Bayo's tone is even more goofier than DMC
[0:44:07] <%BoxNavy> this will NEVER be a pure plat stream jermaPluto
[0:44:15] <+Over_ninek> makes senses what with the purge no one around to train her
[0:44:19] <%Ranryu692> I bounced off of Bayo because its control scheme is in between DMC and Nier Automata's, and I kept confusing the buttons
[0:44:19] <mister_z_1994> The best Smash 4 mechanic ever Kappa
[0:44:19] <%d1stantutopia> PAT GO BACK FOR THE SECRET
[0:44:20] <%SirGO0SE> what time?
[0:44:20] <+PleasantLee> which time?
[0:44:26] <rytisone> smash that wall first
[0:44:28] <Alzero83> Its that thing thats in everything else Kappa
[0:44:29] <ullyzeez> i always preferred Bayo 1 to 2
[0:44:34] <%d1stantutopia> Once you activate the elevator you go back to where the key was
[0:44:38] <%BoxNavy> WE did it :)
[0:44:39] <+HyperCharge_Sam> ALWAYS BACKTRACK
[0:44:40] <%d1stantutopia> It's so stupid
[0:44:41] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> if it's underwater, I guess you could call it a sea-cret. dnoBRUH
[0:44:45] <Vyneci> It's not there yet
[0:44:45] <Whensmahve1> We’ll get Bayo 3 whenever Lucia returns to DMC
[0:44:46] <%Andrizzleton> I HATE that
[0:44:48] <+abrupt_abe> The backtracking secrets suck
[0:44:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> ye
[0:44:50] <Blank9> it's a LOT
[0:44:51] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt psaHoldon Why did a Smash character get her own spin-off game? psaHoldon
[0:44:53] <primaryfire> that is so annoying
[0:44:55] <BleedinActionMan> Bayo 2 is way nicer in that respect
[0:44:58] <alvaroeltz> yeah, the secrets are kinda bullshit
[0:45:01] <Blank9> and they're backtracking at different parts constantly
[0:45:03] <%Andrizzleton> You have to go all the way back to the elevator
[0:45:03] <+Over_ninek> can we just make this a lets play and you can go grab some notes
[0:45:05] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:45:05] <BleedinActionMan> Bayo 2 is nicer in every aspect
[0:45:05] <%tinyswampthing> its my biggest issue with these games
[0:45:11] <s1rcuit> @Whiskey_T_Foxtrot lol
[0:45:11] <Vyneci> Here's a secret RIGHT BEFORE THE FINAL BOSS FIGHT
[0:45:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I know she's super fliry but does Bayo actually know what sex is?
[0:45:16] <+HyperCharge_Sam> there is a secret verse back there once you beat up the thing I think
[0:45:17] <Vyneci> Now it's there
[0:45:19] <%Aydarkzero> whats the switch version run at for frames?
[0:45:19] <rytisone> got maybe 2 on my first playthru
[0:45:27] <%d1stantutopia> You missed it
[0:45:28] <fran031> Bayonetta is such a good character for Smash, but so weird in retrospect
[0:45:29] <Rekinsinn> do you get to have witch time for these puzzles on the highest difficulty?
[0:45:30] <Blank9> I full on missed an entire weapon on my first run
[0:45:31] <BleedinActionMan> @BallerSwagBro9k absolutely
[0:45:34] <Broken_Sonex> @BallerSwagBro9k IT'S UNCLEAR
[0:45:36] <penitentpendant> @BleedinActionMan Weren't the cutscenes even more scaled back in 2?
[0:45:37] <Whensmahve1> Isn’t Madam Butterfly basically a stand?
[0:45:44] <pilllowofbees> @BallerSwagBro9k Yes... yes
[0:45:50] <mister_z_1994> @BallerSwagBro9k She isn't one for babies; making them though, that's another story Kappa
[0:45:53] <+Over_ninek> (_)_)
[0:45:54] <%the22cstomp> @BallerSwagBro9k she sexually spanks a female angel later, so yes
[0:46:08] <Blank9> bayo upgrade is the most horizontal upgrade system
[0:46:12] <%d1stantutopia> @BallerSwagBro9k I think she knows what sex is but is unaware that she's already in a committed relationship with Jeane
[0:46:20] <%d1stantutopia> Even besides her amnesia, that is
[0:46:22] <Louie_Salmon> Wait isn't that the same in DMC
[0:46:23] <@SoFarFetched> that dog big snore
[0:46:25] <%Aydarkzero> i don't know why but Bayo's run animations reminds me of how Sora runs when he's a heartless in kh1
[0:46:30] <BleedinActionMan> @penitentpendant define 'scaled back'
[0:46:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHO IS THAT BADASS?
[0:46:34] <Blank9> The accessories change so much
[0:46:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HE LOOKS RAD
[0:46:41] <primaryfire> yea the sprint upgrade in dmc is super cheap
[0:46:41] <Louie_Salmon> Isn't the first upgrade for every DMCV character their sprint?
[0:46:43] <cherrycottontail> @whensmahve1 the opposite
[0:46:43] <Whensmahve1> Oh god I forgot about the PowerPoint cutscenes
[0:46:44] <Blank9> santa
[0:46:46] <+Over_ninek> too close to GOD
[0:46:47] <%SGrim> This prudes are too holy!
[0:46:47] <rufus2k2> still thinking about that dude's instakill in Bayo 2
[0:46:50] <+razielhex> Is Bayonette a Dante Alighieri game?
[0:46:50] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Cool cutscene approach, probably saved a lot of animator time
[0:46:52] <%SGrim> these*
[0:46:54] <pokefan9956> idk. I think I prefer bayo not knowing what sex is because it's funnier
[0:46:56] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:46:57] <Hydrapissed> sonic rings
[0:46:57] <%Dementedpenguin> bless
[0:46:58] <%tinyswampthing> santa claus
[0:47:00] <+Totally_Not_Toby> way past cool
[0:47:01] <+razielhex> Huh.UHKYYAAAAAHHH
[0:47:01] <%SirGO0SE> what a bad ass sneeze
[0:47:02] <%StrawberryPantsu> SANIC
[0:47:03] <@SoFarFetched> he gives them to sonic Kappa
[0:47:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GOTTA GO FAST
[0:47:08] <KeiPrime> sonic hegehog
[0:47:08] <+Over_ninek> these cut scenes though
[0:47:08] <%YakumoYomi> Santa is a badass
[0:47:08] <ullyzeez> HA HA girl sneeze
[0:47:12] <%BoxNavy> vineSanic NICE
[0:47:12] <filialpails> sonic buys them from him
[0:47:14] <ricky12k1> He has sonics rings
[0:47:15] <Laecerelius> Gotta witch fast!
[0:47:17] <%UvBenServed> So Sonic is an angel?
[0:47:22] <Whensmahve1> Can’t have shit in Green Hill Zone
[0:47:24] <mister_z_1994> Maybe the reason Bayo 3's taking so long is that they're actually animating the cutscenes this time
[0:47:24] <%d1stantutopia> Your reminder that Jeanne is a schoolteacher who also moonlights as Cutie J, a magical girl superhero.
[0:47:29] <paralars_> oooh shes gonna say it!
[0:47:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yo this guy is rad
[0:47:35] <Psyramics> these are the same rings Sonic uses, therefore, Sonic is an Angelic Being and diametrically opposed to Bayonetta. They are destined to wage battle
[0:47:41] <Fear_Ranjer> RODIN I LOVE YOU
[0:47:42] <%patriotrenegade> Bayo 1 is about saving Jeanne, right
[0:47:48] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[0:47:49] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I like that Rodin got an assist trophy in smash
[0:47:49] <%Visorak6> GOOD
[0:47:51] <+razielhex> pseudoracism
[0:47:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:47:53] <%FacetiousAF> we love murder
[0:47:55] <+Totally_Not_Toby> based? idk
[0:47:55] <$LtDogg07> sonic kills angels to get his rings?
[0:47:56] <BubbaRands> In YO ass
[0:47:56] <Meriokingston> LOL
[0:47:56] <joshua_42> “I will bust a cap in your ass”
[0:47:58] <BleedinActionMan> @patriotrenegade That's 2
[0:47:59] <+razielhex> cryptofascism
[0:48:00] <mister_z_1994> No that's Bayo 2 @patriotrenegade

[0:48:00] <ExpressNode> She ain't wrong

[0:48:02] <+Birdigalore> RODIN IS SO COOL
[0:48:03] <%barrakuta371> Cause gubs
[0:48:03] <rytisone> Japan's writing for Americans
[0:48:04] <%UvBenServed> It's true, we all say that
[0:48:04] <%Piemen99> hell yea baby
[0:48:04] <%NovaKnightmare> We love murder so much
[0:48:04] <%weissguard> @patriotrenegade That's the first part of 2.
[0:48:05] <Alzero83> Dont blame america
[0:48:06] <marvel877> Pat, you talk like that to your pets all the time.
[0:48:07] <%StrawberryPantsu> BIG MURDER
[0:48:08] <%d1stantutopia> something something school shooting
[0:48:08] <%twistedj3ster> because Britain didn't supervise us growing up
[0:48:10] <Whensmahve1> Bri’ish?!?
[0:48:10] <%BoxNavy> america do be saying that
[0:48:10] <+Totally_Not_Toby> i mean murder is pretty cool
[0:48:12] <ScreamLord> Rodin is the best character after Bayo and Jean
[0:48:12] <+paladinstarbuster> Does Rodin give Bayo the pass in bed
[0:48:13] <%Aydarkzero> item get
[0:48:15] <joshua_42> THE COOLEST MOTHER FUCKER
[0:48:16] <%shurtal> so pat's gonna first try Rodin at the end of the playthrough, right?

[0:48:21] <Fear_Ranjer> HALOS
[0:48:22] <pilllowofbees> @patriotrenegade thats 2

[0:49:07] <SleepyMaribo> @PatStaresAt will you be doing the combo glitch for absurd amounts of halos?
[0:49:08] <%Aydarkzero> huh
[0:49:10] <Psyramics> yeah, its a Platinum Parry
[0:49:13] <%Valdorick> MSG PARRY!?
[0:49:14] <ARDM112> The same parry as in Revengeance and Automata
[0:49:16] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I love that MGR just took a bunch of these mechanics and RAN with them
[0:49:20] <Whensmahve1> I’ll pleasure at a high price, stranger
[0:49:20] <%Valdorick> MSR*
[0:49:25] <joshua_42> Real ass real 3S parries
[0:49:26] <+Over_ninek> never ever
[0:49:29] <+snausages_> yea same parry as mgr
[0:49:29] <%Futurecity10> Cheer500 it’s time for work horror stories. Today I went to a customers house and had to remove a security panel. Upon cracking open the case just a metric fuckton of cockroach corpses and filth poured out. Suffice to say those clothes I was wearing are now burning
[0:49:30] <@SoFarFetched> they just heal you and do magic stuff
[0:49:31] <Louie_Salmon> But why not cheat?
[0:49:31] <%BoxNavy> its where rising got its parry from yeah
[0:49:31] <%Futurecity10> Futurecity10's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[0:49:32] <Valdorick> MG* oh god, I'm making it worse and worse.

[0:49:36] <rufus2k2> RED HOT KICK~
[0:49:37] <professorno> godlike
[0:49:37] <Laecerelius> The good shit!
[0:49:40] <primaryfire> you're not getting that parry before ng+ though and that sucks so hard
[0:49:40] <DrkJP520> Doesn't amiibos give you haloes in this version?
[0:49:40] <ScreamLord> Ako from Little Witch Academia made those Rosary Kappa
[0:49:42] <@SoFarFetched> but using them removes points
[0:49:43] <MrDoomtastic44> I just grinded on Temperantia for enough to get the Climax Brace, then went from there
[0:49:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Man I need to play this game. I love DMC soooo
[0:49:45] <@SoFarFetched> from your style
[0:49:46] <%Valdorick> That's the one
[0:49:48] <Fear_Ranjer> Every game should have an aerial dodge
[0:49:48] <ARDM112> Though the MGRR one way easier to do than the rest, you can fucking mash it
[0:49:49] <+Over_ninek> Why isnt it baseline honestly
[0:49:49] <s1rcuit> Thanks for the 2020Glitchy @futurecity10
[0:49:50] <+HyperCharge_Sam> I don't even remember having to buy that
[0:49:50] <%BoxNavy> that exploit is nuts
[0:49:52] <PulverKong> the thing is you want all the cool moves AND those expensive items.
[0:49:54] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> for some miniboss events yeah you'll just get smoked without it
[0:49:54] <+snausages_> Breakdance move is so bad
[0:49:54] <+razielhex> @Futurecity10 Fuck off

[0:49:57] <penitentpendant> Yeah, dodge moves are usually key
[0:49:58] <mister_z_1994> Oh hi Akira

[0:50:35] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> ...does she? That's hot
[0:50:35] <rufus2k2> oh boy here comes the Virtua Fighter lore

[0:50:47] <Delrugal_> she even puts on an accent for it
[0:50:49] <%AkronymCLT> is it the japanese voice or the english that says it?
[0:50:49] <%patriotrenegade> Oh thats not a Naruto reference? Kappa
[0:50:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @d1stantutopia Yeah it's just one of those games that flew under my radar for a long time until the Woolie LP
[0:50:53] <%FacetiousAF> no akira the street fighter Kappa
[0:50:53] <Mvrdok_> LUL
[0:50:55] <%Aydarkzero> Kappa
[0:50:55] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I am very bad at Bayonetta, never heard that Kreygasm
[0:50:56] <Hydrapissed> one person and me
[0:50:56] <NitronStreams> JYUUNEN HAYAIN DAYO
[0:50:57] <+itsgundamu> Yea I love Dead or Alive
[0:50:58] <Louie_Salmon> Well, they did.
[0:50:59] <@SSaryn> And it ain't Sega
[0:51:00] <mister_z_1994> Kamiya and Sakurai do at least
[0:51:00] <%kewlmyc> Wait, I always thought that was a glitch in Smash
[0:51:01] <BubbaRands> Freaked me out when I first played and heard japanese LUL thought there was a gitch
[0:51:03] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Which move, did you mean ALL of them?
[0:51:04] <mike2hands> yeah you two can hug and kiss now
[0:51:04] <%walternatorz> pat's not alone
[0:51:05] <%notsoy> too bad she can't pick up chairs or bikes like another sega game protagonist
[0:51:05] <SleepyMaribo> Thats the coolest fucking thing!
[0:51:05] <Manwad> are you hype crying
[0:51:07] <%BoxNavy> i didnt know thats how you triggered it
[0:51:09] <%weissguard> I WANT VIRTUA FIGHTER! psaPat
[0:51:09] <Whensmahve1> Haha from Pineapple Express right?
[0:51:13] <bleugh> virtua fighter nyannFUG
[0:51:16] <%FacetiousAF> i do like butts...
[0:51:17] <%SaiyanShoto> Wow like that dead or alive game!
[0:51:18] <LVL1_Scumbag> Especially not virtua fighter
[0:51:19] <%TheBensonator_> H I P S
[0:51:23] <PanicSwytch> Ive played this game a hundred times and I didn't know that
[0:51:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No they dont Pat LUL
[0:51:25] <+itsgundamu> Throws it back
[0:51:26] <Hydrapissed> sassy ass walk
[0:51:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's called CLASS
[0:51:29] <%SGrim> Butts are a universal good
[0:51:31] <%Ranryu692> it's like she's trying to draw a foul
[0:51:32] <%Ne1son> Hell Yeah she does
[0:51:32] <%joeobo2> she's sexy and she knows it
[0:51:33] <+amwaffle> I prefer this over 2 just for the Sega references
[0:51:33] <PulverKong> Must hurt her lower back to walk like that
[0:51:35] <%TheBensonator_> She knows what she got
[0:51:36] <pokefan9956> is bayonetta walking just the dempsey roll?
[0:51:36] <BubbaRands> She throw it B A C K
[0:51:37] <+lanik745> what part of her is natural
[0:51:38] <Whensmahve1> So is Bayo a broke hobo like Dante?
[0:51:38] <%d1stantutopia> @BallerSwagBro9k that's fair, this game doesn't have nearly the popularity it should. I hope DMC5's success brings more character action fans and games going forward
[0:51:38] <MrDoomtastic44> Helena Taylor definitely says it. I haven't listened to the JP dub in the rereleases yet, but I imagine they did the same in that
[0:51:38] <+thegreenbenis> Them hips don't lie
[0:51:40] <%notsoy> inch? feels like a lot more than that
[0:51:42] <%BoxNavy> she loves it
[0:51:44] <marvel877> It better move. Paige's is fully employed.
[0:51:45] <%Visorak6> Thats the reason her run is fucked up
[0:51:47] <Mvrdok_> LUL
[0:51:47] <PatchySouls> and then her run cycle is impaired
[0:51:48] <KeiPrime> ass sashay
[0:51:48] <bettysharkface> Yeah cause it doesn't happen when she run
[0:51:50] <juxtest> Catapulting ass around the room
[0:51:50] <%jorniev> THAT IS JSUT THE EXTRA BUTT
[0:51:52] <penitentpendant> Trying to do calligraphy with her ass
[0:51:55] <bettysharkface> Only when she walk
[0:51:58] <%YakumoYomi> She's got that "model walk" where her legs cross each other
[0:52:00] <Broken_Sonex> She knows her ass is FAT
[0:52:01] <rytisone> Alfheim portals
[0:52:07] <Laecerelius> But the content, Pat!
[0:52:12] <+razielhex> EXULTIA
[0:52:13] <@SoFarFetched> nah do those c hallenges to show paige how it's done Kappa
[0:52:17] <%colouroftheiris77> Bayo trying to run the pick & roll everywhere
[0:52:18] <SleepyMaribo> @Whensmahve1 Bayo hasa really successful job as a nun. no joke.
[0:52:19] <rufus2k2> Dear Rodin, the Ass was Phat
[0:52:20] <pokefan9956> the ass was fat?
[0:52:25] <Louie_Salmon> Do these lore bits matter?
[0:52:32] <KeiPrime> its cause shes running in heels, thats why her run cycle is so weird
[0:52:42] <BleedinActionMan> I never noticed her walk animations because I just Panther ran everywhere
[0:52:42] <rufus2k2> it's like that Star trek TNG episode
[0:52:45] <%AzureGale> God dog is a palindrome
[0:52:50] <%d1stantutopia> @Louie_Salmon of course they matter
[0:52:51] <MrDoomtastic44> @Louie_Salmon eh, world building's always nice
[0:52:51] <ammobasket> TILT WARNING
[0:52:54] <@SoFarFetched> think the lore in this is just "oh here's how shit works in this universe"

[0:54:12] <%Ranryu692> also title cards
[0:54:13] <+HyperCharge_Sam> It's like that one moment in DMC 1, but with every cutscene
[0:54:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DMC3 had it though, didn't it?
[0:54:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Welp LP over

[0:55:46] <MrDoomtastic44> attack, and dodge when necessary
[0:55:49] <+Over_ninek> damn now i have to replay this
[0:55:53] <%FacetiousAF> fatty pig dog?
[0:55:57] <dark_kebabs> is it true, that there are 26 enemy types in this game, named from A-Z?
[0:55:58] <Whensmahve1> You got it set on W for Dead Weight, you need to set it to M for MOTIVATION
[0:56:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I see she fully embraces the Dominatrix style
[0:56:02] <+Toxic_Cizzle> yeah this game is way harder than 2. a fact I only remember when I go back and get my ass kicked.
[0:56:03] <%TheBensonator_> psaDogchamp
[0:56:04] <Stipli> Its been a while since I have seen the demo, the enemy drops look like sonic rings LUL

[0:56:28] <Alzero83> that puppy cuteness doesnt last forever Kappa
[0:56:29] <+IrishWeegee> toot

[0:58:12] <+MayorRev> Byonetta summoning her minions like SourPls
[0:58:21] <+Over_ninek> i love how it casually changes size in the middle of the swing
[0:58:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Not Crazy Talk?
[0:58:22] <%TUMZtwitch> "starter Harder"
[0:58:24] <Louie_Salmon> @penitentpendant Nah Bayo doesn't have sex, she's sexually attracted to violence
[0:58:26] <Estuko> @TrollKing96 hours spent reading them, did the same for all DMC games too and any other games with lore involving the monsters
[0:58:27] <@SoFarFetched> yeah it's an Enzo statue made of stone
[0:58:28] <Stipli> Whats the highest rank?
[0:58:33] <@SoFarFetched> Pure Platinum
[0:58:34] <+trackles_64> Minage a Troi??
[0:58:36] <%FacetiousAF> SourPls aa la bomboooo
[0:58:37] <@SoFarFetched> because platinum games Kappa
[0:58:38] <MrDoomtastic44> @CSeriesJTYPE The colour varies a bit through the game, and the details on the environments themselves are nice
[0:58:40] <+rbakervv> go back and turn it in idiot
[0:58:46] <+ZoopZoops> Pat you really pissed off the Rare's didnt you?
[0:58:46] <%TUMZtwitch> Rhythym wise?
[0:58:52] <%FacetiousAF> oh crazy talk Kappa
[0:58:54] <%TUMZtwitch> Rythym*

[0:59:05] <%d1stantutopia> "really screwed me up" Pure Platinum SourPls
[0:59:07] <CSeriesJTYPE> @MrDoomtastic44 yeah im being unnecessarily negative for some reason lmao
[0:59:07] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt at any point, have you been able to get all the crows and/or unlock everything?
[0:59:07] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:59:08] <%FacetiousAF> i don't even remember what the birds get you
[0:59:11] <rytisone> bye secret
[0:59:13] <+DemonScratch> It's funny because I've been screwed up in DMC 5 because I was playing Bayonetta again before I was gifted it
[0:59:19] <filialpails> the door shall remain closed
[0:59:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Viewtiful Joe 3 never BibleThump
[0:59:22] <primaryfire> pretty much every enemy has hyper armour until you're in witchtime
[0:59:22] <@SoFarFetched> its okay just do it off screen
[0:59:24] <PulverKong> you can go back only on the screen between levels
[0:59:24] <penitentpendant> @Louie_Salmon I feel it's the same as DMC. In universe the main playable characters can't actually acknowledge having sex.
[0:59:29] <rufus2k2> @d1stantutopia i mean it was just 2 enemies
[0:59:29] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[0:59:33] <%twistedj3ster> I hate when games do that
[0:59:38] <+PleasantLee> I love it when you get a pure platinum for the chapter and on the trophy screen you get cereza says "oh mummy you're the best"
[0:59:40] <+MayorRev> Imagine going back toDMC5 after this
[0:59:42] <PanicSwytch> Pat I know u and woolie prefer dmc5 gameplay but I still love bays controls
[0:59:44] <paralars_> if you get all the birds and achievements you get the infinite ammo headband

[0:59:48] <PulverKong> there's a level select between every level tho
[0:59:57] <%FacetiousAF> yo that dude has a face for a dick
[0:59:57] <%d1stantutopia> BOSSBACK
[0:59:58] <PulverKong> can redo levels over and over to grind rings etc
[1:00:01] <+IrishWeegee> dog snore is legit making me thing theres a demon growling somewhere in the game
[1:00:03] <Stipli> A flashback boss?!
[1:00:07] <+trackles_64> this gameas plot made no sense
[1:00:22] <%TUMZtwitch> WHOAH
[1:00:22] <%Aydarkzero> is she okay?
[1:00:22] <MrDoomtastic44> @CSeriesJTYPE Eh, I get it, varied colours are nice, but if everything was like that, there'd be less overall variety. Bayo 2 went in on more colour so each of them look distinct from each other
[1:00:26] <+Totally_Not_Toby> oh no they suuuuck
[1:00:33] <professorno> I thought this guy was going to be this game's Ridley
[1:00:34] <BubbaRands> My Nakama nooooo! WutFace
[1:00:34] <%Piemono> Pat why didn't you save those women?
[1:00:36] <%BoxNavy> D:
[1:00:36] <%Standard_Enemy> I love how the Tetsuzanko wicked weave has infinite range
[1:00:37] <diontmack> theswe witches are weak shit
[1:00:39] <+Wizardism> I really like this game, it has issues that stop me from loving it completely, but it still hold a special place in my heart.
[1:00:41] <@SoFarFetched> she didn't have the power of being an important character
[1:00:41] <NitronStreams> Man they suck at dodging
[1:00:43] <rytisone> and then it's gonna eat you, oh my goood
[1:00:45] <Stipli> its probably just a scratch leighxMonkaS
[1:00:53] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this looks very winnable
[1:00:58] <CSeriesJTYPE> @MrDoomtastic44 I think its just the washed out over-bloomed look that gets me
[1:01:22] <%MechArch> bye
[1:01:22] <%d1stantutopia> COWARD
[1:01:29] <PulverKong> that was in the past, makes total sense
[1:01:31] <paralars_> i hate this dragon-guy, mostly because you fight him like 16 times in this game
[1:01:31] <mike2hands> JEEZUS THAT SNORE
[1:01:35] <%BoxNavy> he got fed up and left
[1:01:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Is that ominous grumbling zangief???
[1:01:45] <%TUMZtwitch> That was good :) Simple flashback, quick battle
[1:01:45] <PulverKong> yeah he shows up ALOT
[1:01:53] <@SoFarFetched> here you go pat
[1:01:58] <+IrishWeegee> @daniel_is_i indeed
[1:02:00] <%AzureGale> Atelier etc.
[1:02:01] <mycoldshoulder> you fight him like... 3 times
[1:02:03] <penitentpendant> "I've discovered Alchemy." "You don't say."
[1:02:05] <+MayorRev> bayo gets ultra horney when you get a perfect score
[1:02:17] <paralars_> you definitely fight him 6 times at least
[1:02:21] <%BoxNavy> he foudn alchemy
[1:02:22] <drag0nbl00ded> Items?! Bleh
[1:02:22] <%FacetiousAF> @MayorRev so do the rest of us
[1:02:25] <%d1stantutopia> Time for SHOTGUN
[1:02:29] <%d1stantutopia> I love SHOTGUN
[1:02:32] <mo0ody2090> first time playing ?
[1:02:34] <%TUMZtwitch> @MayorRev I don't know much about the game, but I remember hearing that...

[1:02:39] <%FacetiousAF> shotgun gud
[1:02:39] <+MayorRev> 👀
[1:02:40] <+Gorotheninja> PATS PLAYIN DEM ANGEL GAMES!!!
[1:02:43] <MrDoomtastic44> @CSeriesJTYPE That's fair. I don't mean to fanboy too hard. I think the washed out look can work if the textures look interesting enough, which imo this does well. It's not for everyone
[1:02:44] <%Aydarkzero> someone say Shotgun PogChamp
[1:02:44] <jumpyhugs> hello orb and orb fans
[1:02:50] <%WutangchickeN> more like BayoNUTta am I right girls wutang6AHAHA wutang6AHAHA wutang6AHAHA

[1:02:50] <+Gorotheninja> PokMewtwo PokMewtwo PokMewtwo
[1:02:55] <+Wizardism> As it should be
[1:02:57] <paralars_> he shows up in the shmup level and in the boss rush at the end
[1:02:58] <%FacetiousAF> chat you can only put the shotguns on one place: do you pick the arms or the legs?
[1:03:00] <ScreamLord> Except HE kills the big demon
[1:03:00] <penitentpendant> Music?
[1:03:06] <%Bt_Robot> Except now it's angel weapons
[1:03:07] <ExpressNode> Is this game the Satan?
[1:03:08] <rytisone> lets hope this doesnt trigger dmca
[1:03:12] <PulverKong> not really since you have to find all those LP parts in the levels first...some are well hidden
[1:03:19] <%Grimlockfly> I enjoy that are boy basically fights his way through hell to get u knew stuff
[1:03:21] <%d1stantutopia> @FacetiousAF legs, easier to time dodge offsets and shots
[1:03:22] <%FacetiousAF> damn they pretty tho
[1:03:25] <+Wizardism> In the concept art Enzo is playing strip poker with Dante
[1:03:25] <PulverKong> usually the records are broken into 3 parts
[1:03:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Plz tell me Rodin is playable
[1:03:27] <%SGrim> Ah yes, Guns and Roses
[1:03:32] <+Gorotheninja> I never use the Onyx Roses
[1:03:32] <DrkJP520> old ass classic music can't trigger anything
[1:03:33] <VritraReiRei> what was the name of that song? its not the Nutcracker suite is it
[1:03:33] <%TUMZtwitch> OH DAYUM
[1:03:37] <%BoxNavy> that took him like 10 seconds
[1:03:38] <CSeriesJTYPE> @MrDoomtastic44 No I totally get it lol
[1:03:38] <%FacetiousAF> no its red hot kick Kappa
[1:03:41] <+MayorRev> yooooooo
[1:03:43] <Blank9> rodin is playable in the coop of 2
[1:03:49] <BubbaRands> Shotgun for mah feets
[1:03:49] <DianaTheAscian> what does onyx even mean?
[1:03:54] <cherubs_anonymous> But Stiletto's stinger
[1:03:56] <+trackles_64> This guy easily the best characater
[1:03:56] <+IrishWeegee> twin lever shotties? thats a winner in my book
[1:03:57] <SMuffinMan> @ballerswagbro9k nope
[1:03:57] <+MayorRev> Which is more attractive, shotguns or feet
[1:03:58] <KeiPrime> red hot kick goes down tho
[1:03:58] <%SGrim> @Gorotheninja they're good for mob stunning, and nothing else.
[1:04:00] <%AzureGale> Afterburner is a dope game series
[1:04:02] <KeiPrime> doesnt it>
[1:04:02] <MrDoomtastic44> onyx is a type of rock
[1:04:04] <paralars_> its a gemstone
[1:04:04] <Saltmeisterr> BAYO NUTTA
[1:04:06] <%TUMZtwitch> Guns on the feet feel too specific. LUL
[1:04:06] <Idon__> Onyx is like a black gem I think
[1:04:08] <Idon__> or a rock
[1:04:10] <%SirGO0SE> remember Afterburner for the Sega Genesis?
[1:04:12] <MrDoomtastic44> and a pokemon
[1:04:15] <%BoxNavy> remember sega?
[1:04:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Big Sad
[1:04:19] <%SirGO0SE> @AzureGale nice :)
[1:04:23] <%FacetiousAF> chat there's only the three guns, right? pistols, shotguns, Kilgore?
[1:04:29] <eco419> :)
[1:04:37] <%Aydarkzero> oh
[1:04:40] <paralars_> the shotgun leg breakdance move is REALLY cool though
[1:04:46] <grimporio> billions is a gun i think
[1:04:48] <+trackles_64> shes nude
[1:04:49] <PulverKong> the fire and ice blasters are great when they appear
[1:04:51] <%TUMZtwitch> FEET are beautiful. ALL OF THEM...
[1:04:51] <%d1stantutopia> I find the shotguns easier to time certain combos and dodge offsets with, and they do psaBig damage point blank
[1:04:53] <Blank9> nipple piercings
[1:04:53] <penitentpendant> Defeat Him! FOR WENDYS!
[1:04:54] <MrDoomtastic44> Depends whether or not you count Sai Fung as part gun
[1:04:54] <%TUMZtwitch> Kappa
[1:04:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> SNEAK KING HIMSELF
[1:04:55] <Saltmeisterr> @chat how much gameplay have i've missed?
[1:04:59] <ArgentUndaCova> Burger Sneak King D:
[1:05:00] <+Gorotheninja> Onyx is a Rock type Pokemon, it evolves into Steelix
[1:05:03] <MrDoomtastic44> Billions is also a gun
[1:05:03] <%shiplord13> Run Pat I use to work for him, he stabbed us if we gave too much fries to someone
[1:05:04] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt the shotguns have higher hit stun, but it's pointless against anything bigger than a Joy.
[1:05:05] <BleedinActionMan> @FacetiousAF There's the lazer guns you get from beating hard mode
[1:05:05] <%Kangumosa> Kangumosa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! I remembered to use my twitch prime sub again

[1:07:36] <BubbaRands> What are items?
[1:07:39] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It's somewhat Biblically accurate too. Because Bible Angles are all horrible Lovecraftian nightmares but with Fire and Bird WIngs instead of slime and tendrils
[1:07:43] <@SoFarFetched> Items are the lollipops
[1:07:44] <mycoldshoulder> the real game

[1:08:51] <+MayorRev> cause of the rankings and stuff
[1:08:53] <$Dew217> what's the run?
[1:08:54] <%BoxNavy> @PatStaresAt have you ever beaten the game with that weird skull charaacter that dies in one hit?
[1:08:58] <ARDM112> You do need a red hoy shot on you so you can restart from a checkpoint when you eat shit
[1:08:59] <+Gorotheninja> How long til Shuraba? I need to know!
[1:09:10] <%twistedj3ster> that's no moon
[1:09:14] <AdmiralButtloaf> Didn't Peach beat Bloodborne on New Years Eve?
[1:09:15] <Fear_Ranjer> Is it because the hidden verses are stuck in absolutely bullshit spots alot of the time?

[1:09:27] <BleedinActionMan> @Gorotheninja I think this chapter is where we get it
[1:09:29] <Blank9> Featuring Jean from The Shin Megami Tensei series
[1:09:34] <BubbaRands> It's the eyeliner def
[1:09:36] <+Wizardism> She's great
[1:09:37] <%VoidBaronJules> her overall design screams SMT to me
[1:09:38] <MrDoomtastic44> You can restart from checkpoints whenever. RHS respawns you on the spot

[1:10:22] <%TUMZtwitch> Quinn
[1:10:22] <%d1stantutopia> I like that you can see she's missing the gold thingy before Jeanne shows she's stolen it
[1:10:32] <penitentpendant> Though everyone present matches the DMC one-liner-a-thon
[1:10:39] <Pookiedaexzile> The only thing Dante hasn't done is kissed a girl
[1:10:39] <+PleasantLee> the bayonetta timeline is so fucked
[1:10:41] <%TUMZtwitch> Looks wise- A bit
[1:10:41] <+Over_ninek> GASP
[1:10:44] <MrDoomtastic44> She doesn't but she can tell immediately that Jeanne's similar. They already met in the prologue

[1:11:20] <$realm_forge> This has the same energy as like 2 drag queens with a beef
[1:11:23] <penitentpendant> @Pookiedaexzile At this point, the only way I think Dante will have have sex if he meets a Demoness in hell that knows how to make pizza

[1:15:54] <%doomunderthestairs> noice
[1:15:54] <%Visorak6> Is playing bayonetta on anything but a pro controllr a mistake @PatStaresAt
[1:15:56] <Stipli> normal is the hardest you can start on?
[1:16:02] <pilllowofbees> gross biblical angels are the best angels
[1:16:03] <Blank9> yeah they only give you easy automatic, easy, and normal to start
[1:16:06] <ChungusQuest> that taunt made me feel things
[1:16:10] <%Higure_yoru> Handheld isnt that bad

[1:16:26] <%AkronymCLT> Handheld is not great
[1:16:27] <%twistedj3ster> I mean technically playing it on the Switch is a mistake
[1:16:30] <DrkJP520> I tried playing with joy cons, and goddamn, actually painful
[1:16:30] <Radioactivetaco9> I only ever played bayo 1 on the Wii U gamepad. maybe that wasn't the best choice

[1:20:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Faaather"
[1:20:44] <%doomunderthestairs> fathaaaaarrrrrrr
[1:20:46] <AdmiralButtloaf> FAW-THER
[1:20:47] <Pookiedaexzile> "You filled out nicely" Goes Bayonetta to the man whose father she killed
[1:20:47] <Stipli> straight murdered the dude
[1:20:48] <%Visorak6> FADUR
[1:20:48] <+trackles_64> PLAYER
[1:20:51] <+titansloth93> FAHTHUUUUR
[1:20:51] <DusK_The_Stray> FATHER
[1:20:51] <%dapperdoop> cat
[1:20:51] <Wan6Saber> junkersREKT him good
[1:20:54] <%honeyman18> That's a fucked up cat
[1:20:55] <+hornydino_> those relationships are weird
[1:20:55] <%d1stantutopia> FAthur
[1:20:56] <huskarl_zap> no way hes above 5'9
[1:20:58] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt That is a very weird flashback with his father in the diversuit
[1:20:59] <arkv01> if bayo is 5'4" I'm a dwarf
[1:21:00] <+Gorotheninja> JASON
[1:21:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUKA FROM W101?
[1:21:01] <%watts121> Bayo is like 6'6" at least.
[1:21:05] <%BoxNavy> that looked like a scene from xavier renegade angel
[1:21:20] <Mega_Driver> Bayo is 7'6
[1:21:23] <%TUMZtwitch> FRESH FALLAFELS OVER HERE!
[1:21:38] <%d1stantutopia> It's the best
[1:21:41] <dukenux> My name is Luka... i live across the street~
[1:21:43] <%FacetiousAF> 👀 fallafels?
[1:21:46] <huskarl_zap> huge dangerous glass
[1:21:46] <rufus2k2> y'all really need to get over this Bayonetta is tall chicanery
[1:21:54] <%TUMZtwitch> ACKSHUALLY
[1:21:54] <+Over_ninek> god why havent we gotten the Jojo character action game yet
[1:21:56] <$Tuskor13> @mega_driver does that count the hair
[1:21:57] <rufus2k2> she is japanese coward height
[1:21:59] <TechGamer> Pat playing this game. Such a Gem
[1:22:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> wait wat?
[1:22:01] <%jorniev> JUST A BUNCH OF SHIT BLOWING UP BY ITSELF
[1:22:07] <dukenux> ...but she is?
[1:22:08] <%FacetiousAF> guys this game is really good and fun
[1:22:13] <Mega_Driver> @Tuskor13 everything counts
[1:22:20] <MrDoomtastic44> Bayo's largely just 60% leg
[1:22:21] <%TUMZtwitch> A classic.
[1:22:23] <Stipli> Have to head off have a good one all! Enjoy Bayonetta!!
[1:22:23] <+JingKaisean> I just got an ad for twisted tea
[1:22:26] <+MayorRev> i do genuinely wonder what her perfume is
[1:22:34] <+MayorRev> probably something stupidly expensive
[1:22:34] <%arancet> also take more damage i think
[1:22:35] <CSeriesJTYPE> do only certain button inputs end in wicked weaves? its kind of dial-a-combo like ninja gaiden right?
[1:22:37] <grimporio> also, enraged enemies give more combo points
[1:22:37] <DrkJP520> But they drop way more haloes, iirc
[1:22:38] <+JingKaisean> this meme generation is disappointing
[1:22:38] <%pynkdoe> i want bayo to be my tall gf LesbianPride
[1:22:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Guys, If Luka wasn't taller why would he have a reason to lower his head in her presence
[1:22:45] <Blank9> they also double your points for combos
[1:22:46] <%doomunderthestairs> they did the same thing for Sam in MGS Rising which was cool
[1:22:53] <TechGamer> How come your playing the Switch port? Figured you'd be on PC @PatStaresAt
[1:22:53] <Pookiedaexzile> this is sex chess not sex checkers
[1:22:54] <+Sartastic> I too genuinely wonder what Bayo smells like
[1:22:56] <MrDoomtastic44> @CSeriesJTYPE Yep, some are just regular combos
[1:22:57] <penitentpendant> 9.9 multiplier, goin' strong
[1:23:07] <penitentpendant> Until it wasn't
[1:23:07] <CSeriesJTYPE> gotcha
[1:23:14] <PulverKong> bayo smells of ass and boob
[1:23:15] <BleedinActionMan> @CSeriesJTYPE Pretty much every combo ends in a Wicked Weave
[1:23:18] <FunkyTK> you ruined it
[1:23:18] <CSeriesJTYPE> ive played like 30 hours of this I just didnt retain any of it lmao
[1:23:23] <VritraReiRei> RIP Plat
[1:23:28] <Blank9> bayo 2's only on switch, so may as well play bayo 1 on it too
[1:23:35] <%AkronymCLT> I think most people do
[1:23:35] <+Gorotheninja> Out of curiosity Pat, what's your favorite weapon loadout? You too, chat?
[1:23:40] <2pac_2furious> SMOKE IN MY HOUSE
[1:23:41] <dukenux> Probably like high quality hair conditioner
[1:23:43] <%d1stantutopia> psaBig hits
[1:23:49] <dukenux> cause of the upkeep
[1:23:49] <+Promessa_EX> does it lower their defense at all?
[1:23:51] <%SGrim> But you do more damage in turn.
[1:23:54] <PulverKong> yep and you even get some nintendo flavored costumes like a Link
[1:23:55] <Idon__> wait he just left...?
[1:24:00] <PulverKong> which totally changes your fighting
[1:24:01] <FunkyTK> magic pixel
[1:24:02] <%doomunderthestairs> yes it does
[1:24:03] <MrDoomtastic44> Bayo 2 added more kick ending Wicked Weaves, and multi WW kick combos
[1:24:06] <Blank9> claws + skates is my favorite
[1:24:08] <PageofHeart> You didn’t win
[1:24:11] <BleedinActionMan> I like the skates and the sword @Gorotheninja
[1:24:11] <%shiplord13> Idiot
[1:24:14] <MrDoomtastic44> IT was a good change
[1:24:16] <+skeletonmilk> twitch is stuttering like crazy tonight. is anyone else having twitch shit its ass?
[1:24:17] <paralars_> taunting gives more sanic rings for killing them i think
[1:24:18] <+Totally_Not_Toby> ill chase you to the ends of the EEEAAAARTH
[1:24:19] <+trackles_64> what can puny human do/?
[1:24:19] <%SGrim> Bye spiderman
[1:24:19] <Hydrapissed> I mean less defense and the more swings the more you get to dodge
[1:24:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTHHHHH
[1:24:22] <%Aydarkzero> she's like bitch where
[1:24:24] <%d1stantutopia> @Gorotheninja Shotguns on hands and feet. I love the big damage up close and I find the timing for dodge offset easier with them
[1:24:29] <Saltmeisterr> who?
[1:24:30] <BubbaRands> nananananna LUCA
[1:24:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> oh god

[1:24:37] <HollowMan190> exuse me
[1:24:37] <%Dakuu75> Question: So... if taunting them, makes tyhem faster and stronger, what's the point?
[1:24:37] <bettysharkface> Good job Tuxedo Mask, you did nothing.
[1:24:38] <%weissguard> I'm gonna have to doubt that.

[1:24:40] <Wan6Saber> does she feel guilt? wow
[1:24:41] <@SSaryn> Oh yeah.
[1:24:41] <NitronStreams> But this one isnt a super hero
[1:24:41] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt *Mom
[1:24:42] <+Promessa_EX> wreck everyone's stuff
[1:24:42] <ExpressNode> Same VA?
[1:24:43] <%cvp5127> mom
[1:24:45] <%doomunderthestairs> you play that remastered version of wonderfull 101 Pat?
[1:24:45] <Sunstalker> What about the Filthy Luka from Dragons Crown? D:
[1:24:46] <%CalderGaming> he was way more hung up about his mom though
[1:24:47] <TechGamer> Sadge
[1:24:47] <%ssjklyco> Even if he could catch bayo, what is his plan?
[1:24:47] <penitentpendant> If one of the 101 show up in Bayo 3...
[1:24:49] <Daxalog> But luka is a kid in W101
[1:24:50] <ChungusQuest> that bullet is large
[1:24:50] <MrDoomtastic44> It's definitely not the same guy, just a few intentional similarities
[1:24:51] <super_robo_mg> isn't Wonderful 101 like a zillion years in the future?
[1:24:52] <HollowMan190> but that was done by aliens
[1:24:53] <%snow_bush> The platinum cinematic universe
[1:24:54] <CoffeeKaiju> sega loves Venice huh
[1:24:54] <shmo7707> shmo77GajaPog shmo77GajaPog shmo77GajaPog
[1:24:54] <pokefan9956> nah. dad's were killed by different people
[1:24:54] <ミュウレ4242> but probably not the luka from steins;gate.
[1:24:56] <+HyperCharge_Sam> but their both different dads, how does that make sense?
[1:24:58] <+CannonHeroBrett> i doubt that pat
[1:24:58] <penitentpendant> Old Red, let's Go
[1:24:58] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt W101 Luka has a dead mom, not dad
[1:25:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> REALLY?
[1:25:01] <verscoll> l o r e
[1:25:05] <mister_z_1994> @ExpressNode Nope, Luka in 101 is Jimmy Neutron
[1:25:05] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt great summary
[1:25:06] <+JustToWatch> Wonderful 101 is in the future
[1:25:10] <FunkyTK> @Dakuu75 more juicy juicy points

[1:25:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead

[1:25:15] <MrDoomtastic44> One's Redrave and the other's Luka Alan Smithee
[1:25:21] <mycoldshoulder> Making the enemies stronger from a taunt gives you extra points for your combo
[1:25:23] <%bevyrage> alternate universe luka
[1:25:23] <MrDoomtastic44> *redgrave
[1:25:23] <%tinyswampthing> im caliling it the main character of the ultraman style game they are making will be called luka
[1:25:24] <+Promessa_EX> he gave up
[1:25:26] <Bigyanno> this Luka could have a dead mom too
[1:25:27] <+PleasantLee> Bayo-Luka's mother might be dead too
[1:25:29] <rytisone> He'll be back
[1:25:29] <%Ranryu692> and you'll never see him again
[1:25:30] <ミュウレ4242> we ain't got time for witches.
[1:25:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> W101 Luka had a dead mom
[1:25:31] <+Gorotheninja> Hold on to your butts, we're approaching Shuraba people!
[1:25:37] <Bigyanno> and that luka could have a dead dad too
[1:25:39] <Fear_Ranjer> what if pat got hit by a train
[1:25:41] <+Promessa_EX> well he's really hunting the angels and doesn't realize it

[1:26:41] <Pookiedaexzile> So Bayo 3 is like....Just not coming
[1:26:43] <dukenux> Wait, Alfheim?
[1:26:46] <BubbaRands> TRIAL TIME PogChamp
[1:26:48] <dukenux> what is this, Dad of Boi
[1:26:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Does this game have an equivalent of a Blitz?
[1:26:50] <penitentpendant> The ole college try
[1:26:53] <+Over_ninek> oof
[1:26:55] <chhdez> Anaheim!
[1:26:57] <PulverKong> some of these are horrible..like the "only airborne attacks will kill" one
[1:26:57] <juxtest> This doesn't look like the house from ALF.
[1:26:58] <themightyseptopus> oh no THIS alfheim
[1:26:58] <+JustToWatch> what's the deal with the ghost people
[1:27:01] <Fear_Ranjer> UUUGH GOD WHAT
[1:27:03] <mustachegolem> just use the shotgun
[1:27:04] <rytisone> Durga helps here
[1:27:05] <%tinyswampthing> yeah this one is insaley hard at the start
[1:27:06] <Hydrapissed> enrage him then cap hes back
[1:27:10] <penitentpendant> Wouldn't that mandate taunting since you'd need the Damage Up?
[1:27:10] <BleedinActionMan> @BallerSwagBro9k What is a Blitz?
[1:27:16] <PulverKong> There's even some that fail you for touching the ground once
[1:27:20] <%wydamn> this is a hard one, even with full upgrades
[1:27:20] <%d1stantutopia> This one is bullshit until you get some good moves.
[1:27:21] <+TheotherKristian> Don't worry, Bayonetta 3 is going so well that they won't show us anything out of spite
[1:27:22] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you gotta really dodge a lot and get a bunch of extra bullet damage with these
[1:27:23] <MrDoomtastic44> @JustToWatch long story short, it means she can't physically harm them
[1:27:24] <%tinyswampthing> the katana makes it easier
[1:27:26] <Bigyanno> You probably have to taunt him
[1:27:27] <+PleasantLee> weaves
[1:27:29] <%Standard_Enemy> PKP
[1:27:30] <mike2hands> HOOOOWW??
[1:27:30] <Vyneci> It's possible, just a bit tight
[1:27:32] <Hydrapissed> taunt then cap the back
[1:27:33] <Wan6Saber> FAIL LUL
[1:27:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @bleedinactionman Cool enemy type in DMC4
[1:27:34] <mycoldshoulder> Just do pkp
[1:27:35] <+Promessa_EX> that's for the real ones
[1:27:36] <Psyramics> dps check: failed
[1:27:37] <BubbaRands> ned sword
[1:27:42] <zk_nails> gotta do the 360 with the guns then fire like crazy
[1:27:52] <FunkyTK> just git gud
[1:27:54] <%bevyrage> you can beat this with the 360 shoot move where you get into a bullet gallery stance
[1:27:58] <penitentpendant> @TheotherKristian Just like Elden Ring!
[1:28:13] <theycallmeDREW> Isnt there a short Wicked Weave combo?
[1:28:15] <MrDoomtastic44> The stay in air Alfheim is *the one* to use for grinding halos with the Climax Brace if you're going for speed-coward unlocks like me
[1:28:15] <%Higure_yoru> PKP does a fast Weave attack
[1:28:18] <PageofHeart> I just cheese this with everything else, come back with Kilgore and itano circus it up
[1:28:23] <FunkyTK> @bevyrage With the time constrain?
[1:28:28] <PulverKong> nah wicked weaves are too long
[1:28:45] <huskarl_zap> you have to let him grab you cause when you break it does like 10% dmg
[1:28:45] <%bevyrage> just gotta get some good shots in on that weak spot on the back
[1:28:49] <pilllowofbees> that thing on the back is a weak point too
[1:28:50] <%luketrapwalker> What version is this?
[1:28:50] <+TheotherKristian> Try jumping to his red button then air combos
[1:28:55] <%Dakuu75> @BallerSwagBro9k What'd you mean by, Blitz? Like a pre-emptive-strike or? wut?
[1:28:56] <%SirGO0SE> close
[1:28:58] <rytisone> use harsh language
[1:29:09] <penitentpendant> Relearning Curve at Maximum Effort!
[1:29:13] <%weissguard> You gotta hold like every single punch down for max damage I think?
[1:29:15] <Bigyanno> Does bayo run weird with guns on her legs?
[1:29:16] <mustachegolem> punch punch punch kick kick kick. she will shot with 3 limbs on the holds on the kicks
[1:29:18] <PulverKong> i hated the "stay airborne all the time" ones
[1:29:37] <paralars_> the absolute worst one is the out of body challenge
[1:29:42] <paralars_> with the fire angels
[1:29:47] <+skeletonmilk> i always skipped this one until i got the dang sword
[1:29:47] <PulverKong> these become easier when you get the big sword

[1:31:52] <juxtest> Was one hiding in the fog?
[1:31:54] <PulverKong> fekking bone wheels
[1:31:57] <%bevyrage> the wheels will shoot projectiles when they're laid out flat
[1:32:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Gut Gud Lul
[1:32:25] <%Monkeyweed21> fake fan
[1:32:31] <%AncelDeLambert> FLOCK OFF!
[1:32:35] <BleedinActionMan> Because normally they die before they get the chance
[1:32:37] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt is he Pizza the Mutt?
[1:32:43] <shootybooty1> @PatStaresAt overlay? 🤔
[1:32:48] <PulverKong> this is hard because it lasts so fricking long
[1:33:11] <super_robo_mg> hehehe, she kick him butt
[1:33:12] <%Dakuu75> Question: All these events with the clock counting down are Side-Quests/ Optional. Yes?
[1:33:17] <anuchallengertwitch> I love how this game starts at Eggman's grave
[1:33:26] <BleedinActionMan> Oh yeah, they made the mashing way easier in 2, as well
[1:33:27] <MrDoomtastic44> @Dakuu75 yes
[1:33:32] <+Goblinz_3> Ruined the perfect run LUL
[1:33:32] <%AncelDeLambert> START OVER
[1:33:33] <%Dementedpenguin> @Dakuu75 yes
[1:33:35] <%bevyrage> yes they are @Dakuu75 100% optional but they give BIG bonuses
[1:33:35] <PageofHeart> @dakuu75 these are basically secret missions from DMC
[1:33:37] <PulverKong> They're not quests just mini challenge stages you can find everywhere
[1:33:45] <FunkyTK> @Dakuu75 yep
[1:33:45] <%AncelDeLambert> pure platinum RUINED
[1:33:45] <%SGrim> Remember my fellow Americans, you can build a guillotine for the paltry $600 the government thinks we can live on. KKona
[1:33:51] <juxtest> @Dakuu75 They're like secret missions in DMC, they give rewards but you dont have to do them
[1:33:53] <grimporio> @Dakuu75 kinda. if you want pure plat you need to do them
[1:33:56] <FunkyTK> Like secret missions in DMC
[1:33:57] <penitentpendant> @Dakuu75 Alfhiems are optional area that give permanent upgrades if completed
[1:34:01] <UBERsheep> optional unless you wanna get pure plat score for the stage
[1:34:01] <PulverKong> you finish with a good score and you get some health or mana boosts etc
[1:34:01] <%Dakuu75> I see. Thank you chat.
[1:34:05] <mustachegolem> sadly they count as verses so if you want to complet as stage you have to those these as well
[1:34:08] <+Gorotheninja> Whenever Bayo does the Iron Maiden execution, I always think she's screaming "CARPET BOMB!"
[1:34:11] <mustachegolem> every time
[1:34:22] <PulverKong> You don't get important items from these at all
[1:34:30] <%RealThiele> dick damage
[1:34:38] <anuchallengertwitch> Also Bayonetta jobbed to hell in the new smash trailer. Bayonetta would body the shit outta Sephiroth under normal circumstances
[1:34:42] <+Goblinz_3> The ol dicktwist
[1:34:44] <PulverKong> all the weapons and costumes are won in the main story
[1:34:46] <grimporio> @PulverKong yeah who need health and magic
[1:34:46] <%FacetiousAF> if you shoot the man in the dick he die
[1:34:51] <%bevyrage> i'm pretty sure upgrades count as important
[1:34:56] <PulverKong> yea but not plot critical stuff
[1:34:59] <%Dakuu75> ONE GUY
[1:35:00] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Your sick combos crashed my computer
[1:35:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Sephiroth doesn't have a fucking chance against Bayo
[1:35:03] <Daxalog> Dont get hit
[1:35:08] <huskarl_zap> Remember when the ogre guy grabbed the bayo realdoll boss and wanted to keep it in a jar?
[1:35:11] <DianaTheAscian> shut up one guy
[1:35:11] <VJdarkworld> you get the most important thing of all from these: pride
[1:35:12] <+Goblinz_3> Don't need health if you don't get hit Kappa
[1:35:13] <PulverKong> it's not like "you won't get this cool weapon if you don't finish all these"
[1:35:15] <CrimsonFox777> Chat, I was never into Bayonetta, so is it true that her clothes and some of her power are made from her hair and that's why she's occasionally naked during combos?
[1:35:19] <%bevyrage> these combos 2 sick for psa1guy
[1:35:20] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> but pat if youre so good why do you need upgrades?
[1:35:23] <penitentpendant> Look, I know people like doing LoZ runs with 5 hearts. But no thanks.
[1:35:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Something about her run animation while Pat says "Look at that" is hitting me diffrent
[1:35:25] <FunkyTK> Don't some Alfheim get you a part of discs to get more weapons?
[1:35:26] <BlueLunecy> What the hell counts as plot critical in this game
[1:35:30] <super_robo_mg> just don't get hit 4Head
[1:35:37] <+Gorotheninja> Greninja and Bayo could tag team Sephiroth
[1:35:40] <auraofdawn> is it a multiplier for every successful dodge?
[1:35:41] <dukenux> Even shoes?
[1:35:41] <bettysharkface> That...seems gross
[1:35:43] <arkv01> bayo is ALWAYS naked D:
[1:35:43] <%SirGO0SE> technically, shes always naked
[1:35:44] <+Promessa_EX> i know that pulver is only saying that because of the concept art thing
[1:35:45] <ScreamLord> She's technicallt naked
[1:35:47] <anuchallengertwitch> @AncelDeLambert yup. Not only has Bayonetta beaten two universe important gods: but she regularly kills angels
[1:35:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah, thats why
[1:35:49] <PulverKong> or because weeb
[1:35:49] <huskarl_zap> french
[1:35:50] <ExpressNode> Oh yeah I just bought 32gb of ram. 16gb is apparently not enough for my browsers anymore.
[1:35:51] <%AncelDeLambert> @CrimsonFox777 yes, and yes. Her clothing is a magical construct made using her hair
[1:35:54] <mister_z_1994> Except in Samsh becasue E10 Kappa
[1:35:54] <Wan6Saber> oh yeah, baby athFA
[1:35:57] <%SomeSageAdvice> the hair thing comes from the idea of Witches in real life used hair for spells and shit
[1:35:58] <+bubblebasspickles> even in bayo 2?
[1:36:00] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> witches? ami right fellas?
[1:36:01] <VJdarkworld> witches are POG
[1:36:02] <rytisone> I wish she bacame totally naked
[1:36:02] <Pookiedaexzile> "That seems gross" Weaklings
[1:36:02] <Vyneci> I'm pretty sure the cap is only visual, I think it keeps going up but it looks like it stops at 9999 x 9.9
[1:36:04] <+MayorRev> Bayo is always naked 👀
[1:36:04] <penitentpendant> Where hair conditioner becomes a business expense
[1:36:04] <ミュウレ4242> which is a thing witches do. dance naked, court satan, etc.
[1:36:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Does anyone else notice that Bayonetta has a really fat puss?
[1:36:05] <FunkyTK> She IS a witch, witches do gross hair stuff
[1:36:08] <%wydamn> This is kind of on the level of "Quiet dresses like that because she breathes through her skin"
[1:36:10] <bettysharkface> I hope she washes her hair like...twice a day
[1:36:12] <DrkJP520> One wonders why she just doesn't wear clothes
[1:36:12] <+Kairi__> STFU ONE GUY
[1:36:12] <cgame_me811> Silverhand
[1:36:14] <%bevyrage> guys guys remember that when she has the circlet on her chest she's wearing an accessory meaning NOT NAKED
[1:36:18] <+MayorRev> Man, being a witch sounds AWESOME
[1:36:18] <Wan6Saber> @rytisone same kiaaOK
[1:36:20] <ScreamLord> Even in Smash
[1:36:26] <mustachegolem> shes not naked she has boots
[1:36:26] <+TopTieramisu> excuse me
[1:36:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Bayo 2 makes it clear that it's not really her hair, it's just their magic
[1:36:33] <%SGrim> You'll get there
[1:36:35] <pjbuster> ngl she runs funny, but it makes sense why she has guns for shoes lol
[1:36:38] <cherubs_anonymous> You having a stroke?
[1:36:38] <%AncelDeLambert> ...
[1:36:38] <arkv01> that rat tail does things to my body
[1:36:39] <dukenux> Witches are known from doing shit naked
[1:36:43] <CrimsonFox777> @bevyrage No, it's like socks. She's somehow even MORE naked.
[1:36:46] <VJdarkworld> Witch hair is POG saintrPoggers saintrPoggers saintrPoggers
[1:36:47] <+SaltySombrero> the clothes or the hair
[1:36:48] <PulverKong> shame you can't rotate the camera during those weaves Kreygasm
[1:36:50] <%OswaldTheDog> clothe hair
[1:36:54] <anuchallengertwitch> question: do you think there were ever male Umbra Witches?
[1:36:55] <paralars_> what do you mean naked she's wearing guns
[1:37:00] <AbnormalEnd> this game always hurts me hands
[1:37:00] <+Gorotheninja> Hair cloth hair cloth hair?

[1:37:19] <+trackles_64> Omega diving watches are great
[1:37:22] <+Sargonyx> She must go through a lot of shampoo
[1:37:25] <dukenux> Also, it's like Kamiya found out there are people with long hair fetish and thought "You know, i can push this further"
[1:37:29] <arkv01> hey big boy mommys home with the bagged milk...

[1:37:50] <penitentpendant> @paralars_ I think she misunderstood the phrase "The right to bare arms."
[1:37:54] <huskarl_zap> yeah but does it require a mod to have the right resolution?

[1:42:32] <@SSaryn> Cat don't want it
[1:42:33] <Vyneci> Its Wicked Weaves are also some of the strongest in the game

[1:43:00] <Pookiedaexzile> confirmed
[1:43:00] <mycoldshoulder> this game is tight
[1:43:01] <+seoliart> THAT'S RAD
[1:43:02] <%ssjklyco> Katanas have lasers, just like ancient japan
[1:43:02] <+Goblinz_3> Anime sword beams this game truly has everything
[1:43:03] <Fear_Ranjer> Secret Laser
[1:43:04] <%Dakuu75> moves that are NOT... on the move list.
[1:43:15] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:43:20] <+ill_sage> dat damage
[1:43:20] <huskarl_zap> the toxoplasmosis protects the cat
[1:43:22] <%wydamn> The lasers are necessary for the bushido
[1:43:23] <%Crookedspiral> Woah, I just noticed her butterfly shadow
[1:43:25] <DrkJP520> style on 'em hoes
[1:43:26] <DianaTheAscian> OOOO
[1:43:28] <$spardanwarrior> Wait, you can dodge offset the blade charge!?
[1:43:29] <+Goblinz_3> You should sword beam a boss pat
[1:43:30] <juxtest> The move list is so big you'd never find it anyway
[1:43:33] <penitentpendant> Good ole Sub-Orbital Lasers
[1:43:35] <PulverKong> I think you can put it on your leg if you buy the alt. version at rodins?
[1:43:40] <%ssjklyco> Katana means Japanese Laser beam
[1:43:41] <s1rcuit> @huskarl_zap the what?
[1:43:42] <@SSaryn> Ye
[1:43:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @Crookedspiral awesome, isn't it?
[1:43:45] <VritraReiRei> whoa, you can charge, dodge, and keep your charge!?
[1:43:46] <@SoFarFetched> Pat you pointed that out to Paige when she played it
[1:43:47] <%weissguard> Madame Butterfly, to be exact.
[1:43:48] <%Monkeyweed21> its madama butterfly
[1:43:49] <%Higure_yoru> Its her Persona
[1:43:50] <+PleasantLee> I want to hear a Juunen Hayain Dayo before the streams over, Pat
[1:43:52] <TioXyco> has a sword that shoots beams, Bayonetta trully is a Saer
[1:43:54] <TioXyco> *Saber
[1:43:54] <jamsbybetty> that's because she's bound to Madama Butterfly
[1:43:56] <+Goblinz_3> The best demon
[1:43:57] <%Sol_Install> i mean yea
[1:44:04] <%AncelDeLambert> that's because she sold her soul
[1:44:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @VritraReiRei dodge offset is a thing
[1:44:07] <%Higure_yoru> no Pat its her Persona
[1:44:08] <BubbaRands> GIANT WOMAN Kreygasm
[1:44:08] <+Promessa_EX> patron
[1:44:10] <%Sol_Install> Madama Butterfly is the best one
[1:44:11] <%WhereIsWill> madame butterfly is the goat
[1:44:12] <rufus2k2> more like Soreal
[1:44:13] <%FacetiousAF> oh i know patron, he's from the dark souls 3
[1:44:13] <%Crookedspiral> that's cool as heck
[1:44:14] <+mrredwednesday> goro madama
[1:44:14] <lilferniee> whats a patron demon? :O
[1:44:15] <%AkronymCLT> Madama Butterfly is dope
[1:44:16] <JehutyVer2> matron?
[1:44:18] <+Birdigalore> Whatsd with the grabby hands?
[1:44:18] <%SGrim> Was I the only one who spent hours at a time staring at BAyonetta? I feel like people miss the visuals when that's 85% of her character.
[1:44:19] <Sunstalker> You mean her Pat-ron Kappa
[1:44:19] <%ssjklyco> What if she made a demonic contract with dante?
[1:44:22] <Pookiedaexzile> No Pat that's her Stand
[1:44:24] <+skeletonmilk> the best part of Bayonetta 2 is when you brofist Madama Butterfly
[1:44:26] <+PleasantLee> the butterfly shadow wings are also related to the demon wing shadows that Sparda skin had in DMC!
[1:44:27] <%FacetiousAF> madama butterfly is woolie's favorite Kappa
[1:44:28] <Daxalog> Would you get bound to a demon?
[1:44:28] <ChungusQuest> Every second of watching this game, all I can hear is DBZA Cell yelling through his teeth, "raw SEXUAL energy!"
[1:44:29] <dukenux> What are those grabby demon hands on screen @PatStaresAt
[1:44:31] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt don't the witches form pacts with demons?
[1:44:35] <$spardanwarrior> @Birdigalore Low health
[1:44:44] <jumpyhugs> So Bayo's actually a warlock?
[1:44:48] <%AncelDeLambert> it's just unfortunate that apparently Madama Butterfly is one of the WORST demons to sell your soul to, unless you're dope as hell strong like Bayo
[1:44:49] <%shiplord13> yaoi hands
[1:44:49] <VritraReiRei> @Monkeyweed21 I know about dodge offset, but i would think that dodging in the middle of holding a charge button would reset the charge
[1:44:51] <dukenux> ah neat
[1:44:52] <PulverKong> @SGrim nah that's why we got pornhub
[1:44:53] <+phone5> what the fuck
[1:44:54] <%AncelDeLambert> "back"?
[1:44:55] <+Goblinz_3> Grabby hands
[1:44:55] <rytisone> Katana wielding lady who sold her soul for power, Vergil likey
[1:44:57] <Laecerelius> Gonna grab that ass!
[1:44:59] <+Promessa_EX> slightly better than a vignette
[1:45:03] <pilllowofbees> the hands are the chat
[1:45:04] <%Wallabri> oooh that's way better than making the edges red
[1:45:08] <%FacetiousAF> you're shitting me
[1:45:08] <+Dova573> So does this mean Sparda is also a butterfly?
[1:45:09] <%OswaldTheDog> Not her buns!
[1:45:13] <Manwad> @AncelDeLambert What makes Madam Butterfly a bad deal?
[1:45:13] <%wydamn> lilferniee I may be remembering wrong, but Madame Butterfly is the one that gives Bayo most of her power. And Madame Butterfly is also the one that gets the biggest piece of Bayo's soul when she dies. So she's gotta keep killing angels to stay alive forever.
[1:45:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Those hands are us, the audience, we are waiting for permission to feel the as
[1:45:14] <%logoth_> do combo
[1:45:19] <%shurtal> Do Top Combo
[1:45:22] <%Monkeyweed21> no the best farming spot is the next alfheim @PatStaresAt
[1:45:23] <PulverKong> oh this stupid kid
[1:45:23] <rufus2k2> mummy intensifies
[1:45:25] <%SGrim> @PulverKong religious family monitored the internet, but not video game consoles.
[1:45:26] <Vyneci> Chapter 7 is also a good one
[1:45:26] <+Gorotheninja> Remember the movie "Drag Me To Hell"?
[1:45:29] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt not the second boss?
[1:45:30] <dukenux> Cons of being a demon: You're in hell. Pros of being a demon: You get to touch these buns.
[1:45:31] <%RealThiele> kill the children!
[1:45:33] <KeiPrime> m u m m y
[1:45:37] <%OswaldTheDog> Milf time
[1:45:38] <%AncelDeLambert> @Manwad I think it's supposed to be that she's so insanely hard to channel that trying will kill you
[1:45:38] <Hydrapissed> o0o0o00oo0o0
[1:45:39] <Fear_Ranjer> I love that idea SO MUCH
[1:45:40] <arkv01> based kamiya
[1:45:40] <+r00ddood> this QTE takes a massive shit on the wiiu version of the game
[1:45:40] <grimporio> @PatStaresAt one of the later bosses is better
[1:45:41] <%WhereIsWill> thatd be sick tho
[1:45:42] <%FacetiousAF> JUST POINT A GUN AT THE KID
[1:45:42] <dukenux> Would be neat
[1:45:46] <arkv01> whatever its canon for me now
[1:45:47] <dukenux> IT IS TO ME
[1:45:47] <goatlord_> Are you allowed to play this with a baby in the room?
[1:45:47] <%goatbait> Threatning a kid with a gun
[1:45:47] <rufus2k2> there's also that one item in DMC1
[1:45:48] <Broken_Sonex> I can see it
[1:45:49] <+MugenSandan> it is IN FAN ART LAND
[1:45:49] <+Over_ninek> it's as canon as you want it to be
[1:45:51] <danteftw20> alabama
[1:45:53] <super_robo_mg> Bannanetta
[1:45:53] <ChungusQuest> It sounds good, so we'll go with it
[1:45:55] <%Piemen99> oh word
[1:45:55] <PulverKong> Now you are Mommy-netta
[1:45:57] <PrinceOfEden> LUL
[1:45:58] <auraofdawn> would explain why she married a big bug
[1:45:59] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Bayonetta no! You'll create a time paradox!
[1:45:59] <s1rcuit> that would help explain how she came to know a demon
[1:45:59] <mister_z_1994> Bayonetta and DMC1 at least
[1:46:00] <tolloponik> parallel universes
[1:46:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the best farming spot is in the next alfheim
[1:46:01] <+Goblinz_3> No shut up we'll never get the ultimate crossover Kappa
[1:46:02] <$TallYoda08> should have been
[1:46:03] <penitentpendant> I mean, one of the Demons is straight lifted from DMC so...
[1:46:06] <SomeAsianDood> FLASHBACK TIME
[1:46:06] <ThatGuyThere03> Bayonetta totally would
[1:46:06] <+MugenSandan> I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN THAT FAN ART PAT
[1:46:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's wrong, btw, it's widely held that the tempest boss is the best farming location
[1:46:08] <%ssjklyco> It doesn't explain when Sparda disappears,just that he woke up to justice 2000 years ago
[1:46:08] <BubbaRands> MUMMY!
[1:46:09] <%Fooguwu> Umbral Witches famously weak to falling flaming ceilings
[1:46:09] <%shurtal> does dante even know the sex?
[1:46:09] <%wydamn> Bayo loves those lollipops though
[1:46:11] <hamborgini> I was gonna say, does DMC the series know what sex is even if dante doesn't
[1:46:11] <%SGrim> Now you must mommy yourself.
[1:46:12] <dukenux> She would, but with a knife and fork .
[1:46:12] <%Agami23> isnt there a witchs band or something that was owned by eva or something in a game?
[1:46:12] <+Dova573> Bayo would probaly hate Dante
[1:46:12] <theycallmeDREW> She eats pizza with a fork and knife
[1:46:13] <+PleasantLee> with DMC5, which series has the strongest grip on Redgrave name
[1:46:14] <rufus2k2> she'd eat it with a knife and fork
[1:46:15] <rytisone> when's fanfic reading of Bayo and DMC
[1:46:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> only bagel bites
[1:46:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> She would, it would just have to be EXTREMELY expensive
[1:46:17] <FunkyTK> Bayo eats Pizza with lollypop
[1:46:17] <+twohitgood> bayo would eat a pizza with fork and knife.
[1:46:18] <+Promessa_EX> bayonetta would eat the pizza with her hair
[1:46:19] <@SSaryn> Bayonetta would eat like.. Tartar.
[1:46:19] <%shiplord13> Hot Dogs all the way
[1:46:20] <ergulor> Fancy hicgh class restaurant piza with fork
[1:46:20] <Jontman42> her legs look so goofy long
[1:46:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Are lolipops?
[1:46:22] <Manwad> Bayo would try, then go "EUGH" then go back to eating beans on toast
[1:46:22] <+MayorRev> also fun fact bayo really doesnt like children
[1:46:22] <HelluvaNohbody> She eats pizza with a fork
[1:46:22] <%Sick_Haystacks> Bayonetta would eat a pizza with a knife and fork
[1:46:22] <%RealThiele> LOVES Twinkies
[1:46:22] <PageofHeart> Ok but what if in Bayo 3 they make that super canon
[1:46:23] <dukenux> LUL
[1:46:24] <1matheuw> sounds right
[1:46:24] <Nordguy> she would eat Neapolitan
[1:46:24] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:46:25] <jumpyhugs> what if the pizza had lolipops
[1:46:25] <PulverKong> she LUVS bananas
[1:46:25] <%logoth_> The all phallus diet
[1:46:25] <Hydrapissed> or she subsist off TEA
[1:46:26] <huskarl_zap> eating ass
[1:46:28] <dukenux> The Glizzy Witch
[1:46:28] <penitentpendant> So 7 day a week Taco night?
[1:46:29] <SomersaultJustice> what if she rolled the pizza up into a dong shape?
[1:46:30] <lilferniee> oh wow thank you @wydamn for the lore! i always thought her bond with madame butterfly was really interesting but never got it lol
[1:46:30] <%OswaldTheDog> Bayonetta probably eats a ton of pizza
[1:46:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Bayonetta Only eats the will of the weak
[1:46:33] <%WhereIsWill> bayo has those penis straws confirmed
[1:46:36] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[1:46:37] <%ssjklyco> A pizza and vagina are both triangles
[1:46:39] <mister_z_1994> I dunno she seems pretty into lollipops, though that's probably because of the whole oral thing
[1:46:39] <%arancet> she wouldnt eat anything that didn't cost at least $100
[1:46:40] <%Monkeyweed21> she would deep throat a margerita
[1:46:41] <BleedinActionMan> GRAB THE CONTROLLER
[1:46:41] <KeiPrime> no soups
[1:46:42] <+epoladia> Genital shaped pizza?
[1:46:42] <+Gorotheninja> What if Nero is the son of Vergil and BAYO?
[1:46:44] <+IrishWeegee> she hates round things, reminds her of halos
[1:46:45] <PulverKong> Bayo wouldn't eat a toast with cheese
[1:46:45] <%SGrim> Fortitudo, my boy!
[1:46:46] <indominus_corgi> shed eat pizza with a fork and knife
[1:46:46] <Saltmeisterr> oh this guy

[1:46:47] <rufus2k2> time for bayonetta to say the thing
[1:46:48] <+MayorRev> She sucks on lollipops tho
[1:46:48] <TioXyco> @ssjklyco my thoughts exactly
[1:46:51] <AdmiralButtloaf> Bayo rolls the pizza into a roll and deep throats it
[1:46:55] <+razielhex> So what about a pizza with the middle cut out?
[1:46:56] <%mister___doctor> Just picturing Bayonetta stealing Donkey Kongs banannas
[1:46:59] <+Chewygamer> Bayonetta in the Coney Island hot dog eating contest

[1:48:10] <paralars_> thats actualyl the worst part of this game, along with the chapter after this one
[1:48:11] <%AkronymCLT> Bayo 1 goes a little too hard on the insta deaths
[1:48:19] <+MayorRev> idk if this is sourced but i think kamiya's totally ok with bayo lewds but as long as she's dominant
[1:48:22] <BleedinActionMan> Bayo 2 is way nicer about that
[1:48:24] <mustachegolem> the letter is on screen for less than a second
[1:48:28] <%RealThiele> 'no damage'
[1:48:29] <%Aydarkzero> isn't it always Squre/X/Y though?
[1:48:29] <rufus2k2> NICE DIVE
[1:48:32] <%bevyrage> there are three other qte's just as bad as that one
[1:48:36] <rytisone> that's a dick move to put that qte right at the end
[1:48:38] <+Goblinz_3> One day we'll get that devil may cry and bayo crossover
[1:48:39] <%Buzzard42> >silver
[1:48:40] <mustachegolem> also pretty sure the checkpoint is before the bossfight on original
[1:48:41] <%bevyrage> one of which iirc is the next one to come up?
[1:48:41] <+MayorRev> cause submissive bayo is like out of character
[1:48:41] <%Buzzard42> shameful
[1:48:44] <SomeAsianDood> Silver Pog
[1:48:45] <%tigerfang86> DONT BE AN ENZO
[1:48:46] <Saltmeisterr> SILVER FOR SUCK ASS
[1:48:47] <%zeroarturia> This is why I prefer Bayo 2 over 1.
[1:48:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> ***
[1:48:48] <%tigerfang86> NEVER BE AN ENZO
[1:48:48] <DianaTheAscian> mmm
[1:48:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @paralars_ dont forget 20 minutes of Space Harrier before Jeanne
[1:48:52] <%SGrim> Enzo trophy has the most character though
[1:48:53] <cherubs_anonymous> You probably would've gotten gold if you hadn't died to that
[1:48:54] <penitentpendant> So, if Stone reset level?
[1:48:54] <Blank9> WHAT A DAY
[1:48:56] <mister_z_1994> @Goblinz_3 Our only hope is Smash now
[1:48:56] <BubbaRands> No get the Skull off the screen WutFace
[1:48:57] <%OswaldTheDog> Silver is good!
[1:48:57] <+Wizardism> Oh what a day
[1:48:59] <%wydamn> Ohh ho ho, Wut a DAY
[1:49:01] <+Over_ninek> Platinum and Capcom should make a crossover 4koma comic
[1:49:01] <BleedinActionMan> I think there is like *one* instant death in Bayo 2
[1:49:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> ANGEL ATTACK PogChamp
[1:49:04] <+baldur09> I really hate how many gimmicks platinum games puts in their products. That fucking missle shit later on.
[1:49:04] <tolloponik> Consolation Prize
[1:49:07] <ミュウレ4242> MayorRev, i expect he draws them himself.
[1:49:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I STILL don't know how to properly lead the high point guys
[1:49:12] <Fear_Ranjer> Round over~
[1:49:15] <PulverKong> yeah the shot delay sucks
[1:49:18] <+Chewygamer> Avoiding being stoned is the opposite of my life
[1:49:22] <paralars_> i like the space harrier level, except its too long
[1:49:26] <Udongein_1> you can exchange your bullets for halos by skipping the game if you want
[1:49:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I like the variety but sometimes yeah
[1:49:31] <cherubs_anonymous> It's arcade mentality
[1:49:31] <%RealThiele> pachinko mentality
[1:49:32] <BleedinActionMan> The missile level is actually my favorite
[1:49:32] <+Over_ninek> it's basically buying an arcade
[1:49:35] <%Visorak6> Platinum is a company that loves spectacles
[1:49:38] <dukenux> They really want you to not forget its a video game
[1:49:39] <%FacetiousAF> you heard the man, official pee break time
[1:49:40] <theycallmeDREW> I just hate when the gimmicks fall flat
[1:49:41] <%wydamn> paralars_, the damn good music makes up for it
[1:49:41] <dukenux> which i love
[1:49:42] <%CrowbarFacelift> psaBig pee
[1:49:42] <mister_z_1994> @paralars_ And the motorcycle level
[1:49:42] <%OswaldTheDog> I love the little bayonetta dolls
[1:49:44] <+MayorRev> oh the arwing in bayonetta 2 is fuckin amazing
[1:49:44] <ExpressNode> Then use Nintendo's gimmick, the joy cons
[1:49:45] <arkv01> dog is ready for the oven
[1:49:47] <%wydamn> THIS IS MY FANTASY ZONE
[1:49:48] <%OswaldTheDog> Bye~
[1:49:48] <Pookiedaexzile> I hate how Platinum doesn't give the single game play loop with nothing else
[1:49:49] <BleedinActionMan> but mostly for the boss at the end
[1:49:50] <arkv01> give him cheese
[1:49:51] <penitentpendant> Twitter points are go
[1:49:52] <@SoFarFetched> he will take a photo while he's peeing
[1:49:55] <arkv01> and some peppaloni
[1:49:56] <%shurtal> Waha, woosnore, Pizza
[1:49:56] <dukenux> cause the tendency in big studios is ont the opposite
[1:49:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Why can't they stream line the game to death
[1:50:00] <%FacetiousAF> *okay let's talk shit about the music pat likes*
[1:50:00] <%Piemen99> THANK YOU
[1:50:01] <BubbaRands> Everyone to twitter!
[1:50:02] <Fear_Ranjer> THIS BRB IS SO FUCKING COOL
[1:50:02] <theycallmeDREW> Like theres a minigame in one of the Bayos that I HATED and it almost made me stop playing
[1:50:06] <paralars_> i love the motorcycle level
[1:50:08] <+MayorRev> All the nintendo outfits in Bayo 2 have fun gimmicks
[1:50:13] <+thegreenbenis> Didn't the dev of Near Autotomato tell fans to put the lewds into a folder and send them to him so he could review them
[1:50:13] <+Promessa_EX> yuninjAdog
[1:50:14] <Vyneci> The gimmicks are great the first time through and potentially dreadful every other time after that (LOOKING AT YOU CHAPTER 14)
[1:50:22] <%Piemen99> YEYEYEYEYEYE THIS IS NEW TO ME
[1:50:26] <huskarl_zap> he gotta go change his save file to be all platinum
[1:50:29] <%RealThiele> yea mr viking did a pretty cool thing
[1:50:31] <%FacetiousAF> the bike segment in this always seemed to long for me
[1:50:32] <+Gorotheninja> You know what Platnium game I want an update on? Babylon's Fall
[1:50:32] <%wydamn> thegreenbenis, you're talking about Yoko Taro and yes
[1:50:34] <HelluvaNohbody> The link one just gives you the parry
[1:50:51] <+thegreenbenis> @wydamn What a legend.
[1:50:58] <absolute_cagemony> So how long ago was his diaper full?
[1:51:03] <+Over_ninek> Infinite Space
[1:51:10] <+baldur09> I dont mind if the gimmicks are related to the core gameplay, like new cool outfits, but replaying them is terrible, its acutally why i really like rising, it had very few moments like the "fun" missle section
[1:51:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck all this content, I want a single gameplay loop so I can complain the game is boring and one note later
[1:51:17] <absolute_cagemony> I just got here after watching the diaper clip lul
[1:51:17] <talokur29> Hello.
[1:51:22] <talokur29> Squid1 Squid3 Squid4
[1:51:27] <%wydamn> thegreenbenis, there's a great picture that was floating around of this super hot chick cosplaying as a drakengard character, and Yoko Taro kneeling down to sign her thigh
[1:51:46] <ishouldbeatworklol> where did pat go
[1:51:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Yoko is the man
[1:51:56] <absolute_cagemony> I bet his hands were trembling
[1:51:56] <huskarl_zap> Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 pastaThat
[1:51:57] <%jessyg920> Diaper clip? What the hell did I miss?!
[1:51:59] <Pookiedaexzile> To take a pic of pizza dog
[1:52:01] <absolute_cagemony> Pat had to go change his diaper, it was full
[1:52:03] <+ps4nubian> Pat's bad at video games
[1:52:09] <ergulor> isn't that photo ob 2B?
[1:52:21] <huskarl_zap> Squid1 StinkyGlitch Squid4
[1:52:26] <+baldur09> @Pookiedaexzile bud, im not complaining about more game play, but the section are really unfun and tedious on replay. They add very little.
[1:52:26] <absolute_cagemony> 2B is technically a Drakenguard character
[1:52:26] <talokur29> DrinkPurple DoritosChip CoolCat
[1:52:32] <%Rigmarole111> Rigmarole111 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:52:38] <%wydamn> ergulor maybe it was 2B, I remember it being one of the drakengard characters with an eye flower but I could be wrong
[1:52:44] <huskarl_zap> HyperCheese 2020Delivery 2020Takeout 2020Rivalry
[1:52:48] <Pookiedaexzile> 2b is a drakenguard Character

[1:52:58] <%weissguard> LUL
[1:52:59] <mike2hands> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYY
[1:52:59] <+thegreenbenis> Yoko Taro is a man of culture.
[1:53:02] <%Rigmarole111> LUL
[1:53:03] <rytisone> It was proto dmc
[1:53:03] <+Over_ninek> Rodin confirmed gamer with good taste
[1:53:06] <BubbaRands> LUL
[1:53:09] <dukenux> RE4 exists in Bayoverse
[1:53:11] <absolute_cagemony> Toko Yaro is my hero
[1:53:13] <NitronStreams> Rodin plays videogames?
[1:53:23] <+thegreenbenis> I have never met Yoko Taro but I feel a connection to him.
[1:53:23] <+Promessa_EX> i saw a man outside a lowes say that once
[1:53:29] <talokur29> Hi my name is Frederick! What is your name?
[1:53:29] <SuperRafiMan> Rodins the fuckin best
[1:53:36] <dukenux> I wish i would have as few fucks to give as Yoko Taro
[1:53:37] <%wydamn> ergulor yeah you're right, I just looked it up, she was doing a 2B cosplay
[1:53:37] <%notsoy> bayo learned breaker style?
[1:53:38] <afronooch> ItsHappening
[1:53:39] <%AkronymCLT> but Rodin IS videogames
[1:53:41] <jimmytwofeet> what is this
[1:53:44] <jimmytwofeet> Boivinetta?
[1:53:45] <absolute_cagemony> and Bayonetta and DMC are in the same universe... so a Vergil vs Wesker fight could happen someday canon.
[1:53:46] <segychan> I tried playing this game once, but I'm not good enough to get a good score, and I can't stand getting a bad score
[1:53:49] <DrkJP520> boobabeeboo
[1:53:51] <+Over_ninek> *YAWN*
[1:53:59] <%AncelDeLambert> YOU SUCK, FORTITUDE!
[1:54:01] <pokefan9956> but pat, aren't you 40?
[1:54:07] <CrimsonFox777> So is this a biblically accurate angel?
[1:54:08] <%Sol_Install> WELL
[1:54:10] <absolute_cagemony> just...move this big rock over..
[1:54:10] <dukenux> Wasn't Angel speak based of like a real dead language?
[1:54:12] <+thegreenbenis> Yoko Taro is such a mad man, he gives you a dedicated ass button.
[1:54:24] <%juxtest> Say the line Bayo!
[1:54:24] <%AncelDeLambert> so strong she just pushes a boulder aside like a curtain
[1:54:31] <rytisone> Flock off featherface
[1:54:34] <absolute_cagemony> I saw Yoko Taro dousing for ass in the desert one time.
[1:54:34] <%SGrim> Forty is so fucking cool.
[1:54:38] <Wan6Saber> sound like Jabba hte Hunt
[1:54:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @dukenux just looked it up. It's as "real" as a Ouja board
[1:54:54] <%dashmatt> Literally sounds like Jaba the Hutt
[1:54:55] <%AncelDeLambert> it IS a real fake language, however
[1:54:57] <penitentpendant> So are witches born or women who make pacts with demons? I assume 'born' since Bayonetta is referred to as 'impure blood.'
[1:55:06] <%shiplord13> There goes the neighborhood
[1:55:10] <%AncelDeLambert> @penitentpendant pacts
[1:55:13] <paralars_> they speak enochian
[1:55:13] <%AzureGale> Fire, fire, yeah!
[1:55:13] <Fear_Ranjer> I love that he's just straight up okay with leaving a witch to go about her business because they have no beef
[1:55:20] <afronooch> he HATES it
[1:55:21] <%shiplord13> What could have caused all the fire?
[1:55:23] <arkv01> oh no, the harlem trials!
[1:55:25] <super_robo_mg> wow she just goes around picking fights with angels? what a jerk
[1:55:28] <%wydamn> Pat hates being on fire almost as much as random syringes
[1:55:33] <penitentpendant> @AncelDeLambert k
[1:55:35] <%weissguard> @penitentpendant You need to make a pact.
[1:55:35] <+SaltySombrero> I hate that part
[1:55:37] <absolute_cagemony> HAHA TIME STOP HAS REAL STOPPING POWER HAHA
[1:55:38] <grimporio> or with wicked weaves
[1:55:38] <talokur29> Pat is on Fire!!!
[1:55:41] <BleedinActionMan> @penitentpendant She was born to a Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage, which was forbidden back then
[1:55:43] <+pectusumbra> I'll be real. That kind of looked like the sewers exploding out into poo
[1:55:44] <Radioactivetaco9> because everyone knows that when time is stoped heat doesn't work
[1:55:47] <absolute_cagemony> It's really good against living things.
[1:55:48] <arkv01> remember fire kills the random syringes
[1:55:48] <%SGrim> @absolute_cagemony thank you for forcing the phrase "dousing rod for ass" into my brain. I think that's what I'll call Grindr from now on.
[1:55:51] <%FacetiousAF> my favorite part of random syringes is waving them at people
[1:55:52] <Fear_Ranjer> I'm so glad perma-flamed enemies don't pop up often
[1:55:54] <zk_nails> you can hurt these guys using the sword while wearing the Link costume
[1:55:55] <dukenux> @AncelDeLambert cause there's also this "totally real" angelic language that was "discovered" by like some XVIIIc. occultists or sth
[1:55:57] <+TheNewZealandStory> this is the only part of the game that comes close to being as bad as bayonetta 2
[1:55:58] <huskarl_zap> fire doesnt burn in the slowed time
[1:56:01] <+epoladia> Does the laser still hurt them?
[1:56:03] <+Goblinz_3> Use the beam Kappa
[1:56:04] <%shurtal> Was Zangief photographed?
[1:56:05] <dukenux> implementing that would be cool
[1:56:06] <absolute_cagemony> @SGrim Nice.
[1:56:12] <%AzureGale> Fire doesn't suck, it burns
[1:56:17] <%AncelDeLambert> hint hint
[1:56:17] <VritraReiRei> was it ever explained in the game what caused the lava?
[1:56:23] <talokur29> Time Laser combooooo!
[1:56:23] <mycoldshoulder> thankfully they arent in 2
[1:56:33] <%AncelDeLambert> @VritraReiRei that dragon dude is doing it
[1:56:35] <paralars_> i dont think i ever hit an enemy with the laser beam, and i tried
[1:56:36] <+pectusumbra> can't charge it in the witch time?
[1:56:37] <rytisone> you can shoot weaker laser at half way
[1:56:45] <NeroInfinite> Ye these guys are the witch time/wicked weave tutorial.
[1:57:03] <Pookiedaexzile> I was promised a pizza dog and I got nothing
[1:57:11] <NitronStreams> Fire indeed hot
[1:57:14] <+thegreenbenis> Yoko Taro is gonna be in the news one day, he's going to got on an expedition and get crushed by a statue with a dump truck ass. If only we all could be so lucky.
[1:57:22] <segychan> time to deliver a pizza dog
[1:57:24] <%juxtest> Do the angels on fire ever show up again?
[1:57:28] <absolute_cagemony> Platinum Games are bad and have bad music and bad character design.
[1:57:31] <%wydamn> So fun fact, the angels in this game speak a language called Enochian, which is an actual recorded language from the 16th century that some christian monks claimed to hear angels speak to them in.
[1:57:33] <+Promessa_EX> i have tabs
[1:57:36] <Pookiedaexzile> You Teasing whore
[1:57:40] <Ultimatefool> Time to leave the stream
[1:57:40] <%walternatorz> pizza dog time
[1:57:42] <segychan> XFD
[1:57:46] <Sunstalker> How does that stop them from leabing the stream though? DansGame
[1:57:48] <+Goblinz_3> Pizza dog? Did you put a slice of pizza in a hotdog pat?
[1:57:50] <talokur29> I like the fire, like hot hot hot!
[1:57:52] <VritraReiRei> @AncelDeLambert well i figured that but did they ever say that in game (dialogue/collectible notes) or is that implied
[1:57:54] <penitentpendant> As long as the Pizza Dog isn't cold when it's finally delivered
[1:57:54] <%WutangchickeN> I'm leaving and waiting on Twitter
[1:57:58] <paralars_> the fire angels show up in some bonus levels
[1:58:00] <rytisone> like Rodin Kappa
[1:58:01] <PulverKong> yeah the whip thing is pretty crap
[1:58:04] <absolute_cagemony> Enoch is some Vampire The Masquerade shit

[1:58:09] <Mega_Driver> Crash Bandicoot time

[1:58:11] <%Keaton_x> I have like 12 tabs open right now. What's one more?
[1:58:11] <%walternatorz> This looks more like molten gold than fire
[1:58:14] <%FacetiousAF> puppy psaGib
[1:58:14] <Saltmeisterr> @absolute_cagemony how can you say that :O
[1:58:16] <KasiCrafter> Ah, yes, the Dead Space problem with weapons.
[1:58:17] <+ps4nubian> Pat, i agree that Rare games are bad
[1:58:21] <talokur29> What is the most effective weapon in this game then?
[1:58:25] <mycoldshoulder> whip is good when there are lots of enemies
[1:58:31] <huskarl_zap> Graboid
[1:58:31] <+Goblinz_3> LUL

[1:59:01] <%WutangchickeN> this is because you didn't post the dog picture
[1:59:04] <Pookiedaexzile> I think to like Rare games you have to be in the range of 26 to 40, grow up on the 64 and also have bad taste
[1:59:06] <rufus2k2> where dem earplugs at
[1:59:06] <jamsbybetty> first real enemy in the game
[1:59:14] <+epoladia> There was a heal right there rip
[1:59:17] <BubbaRands> Fairness is my second favorite. You guess which angel is my favorite Kappa
[1:59:18] <paralars_> the rocket launcher nunchucks are pretty amazing
[1:59:19] <Ultimatefool> Wait she doesn't say "The shadow remains come???"
[1:59:26] <+pectusumbra> It's clearly a griffin right?
[1:59:26] <%OswaldTheDog> THE SHADOW REMAINS CAST
[1:59:27] <%AncelDeLambert> yo fuck these dogs

[1:59:34] <%AncelDeLambert> all my homies hate dogs in video games
[1:59:34] <%wydamn> @Ultimatefool what would that even mean?

[2:06:31] <PulverKong> @Dakuu75 heck i spent 50+ hours watching Plague talking about every brick and wall bit in DS1..still haven't played it
[2:06:36] <BubbaRands> RULES OF NATURE

[2:06:42] <talokur29> Oooooooh
[2:06:44] <%Godlike_Turtle> She says "Asta La Vista Baby" it's a Dark Souls reference

[2:07:57] <%ssjklyco> I think you're just bat at it
[2:08:06] <%king_wragles> It's a defensive upgrade that activates on late dodges, allows slightly more offense at the cost of a tiny bit of magic @AzureGale
[2:08:20] <DrkJP520> I though the bat timing doesn't work on the bite attack. or was i thinking of something else?
[2:08:25] <%Dakuu75> @PulverKong welp, to be fair. Plague has a sexy voice like that~
[2:08:27] <A_CD_By_Thomas> screm

[2:14:56] <dukenux> yes
[2:14:56] <%Dakuu75> I still remember the strangest thing about Bayonetta being, the first game was on PS2 (or 3) and the sequel came out on the Wii. a sequel game coming out EXCLUSIVELY on a different console is so weird, to me.
[2:14:59] <Pookiedaexzile> God if they reboot things from 1 and combine 1 and 2's plots that might become a banger @wydamn
[2:15:12] <huskarl_zap> penis music increases
[2:15:16] <%WhereIsWill> crushed it
[2:15:27] <talokur29> @dakuu75 that is weird.
[2:15:30] <+thegreenbenis> What does penis music sound like?
[2:15:30] <+Gorotheninja> Do you think Feminists love or hate Bayonetta?
[2:15:41] <%NopeBadguy> NopeBadguy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Who's got two thumbs, lives in the Bible Belt, and got sent home from work because their boss was being passive aggressive about me not removing my mask? This guy! Please god, get me the hell out of here.
[2:15:42] <grimporio> @Dakuu75 it was made for the xbox 350 and then later ported to ps3
[2:15:43] <%notsoy> it's because exclusivity is the only reason bayo 2 even exists
[2:15:43] <dukenux> yes
[2:15:47] <%Dakuu75> ...
[2:15:48] <+Over_ninek> Both
[2:15:48] <+rbakervv> Thanks for the 2020Glitchy @nopebadguy
[2:15:50] <%AzureGale> Um
[2:15:51] <NitronStreams> yes
[2:15:53] <%FacetiousAF> Mixed.
[2:15:56] <%Visorak6> both
[2:15:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @Gorotheninja it depends on if they are made of straw or not
[2:15:57] <+PleasantLee> women love bayonetta, fact
[2:15:58] <rufus2k2> @Gorotheninja well a woman designed her so it probably made their heads explode
[2:15:59] <Mega_Driver> they do
[2:15:59] <%BoxNavy> thats a cool chat message
[2:15:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yes
[2:15:59] <+Memnarch7> prob a good call
[2:16:00] <%SirGO0SE> they LOVE her I believe?
[2:16:01] <%weissguard> @Dakuu75 Bayonetta 1 was on PS3 and Xbox 360, and the only reason Bayonetta 2 exists is that Nintendo funded it for the exclusivity.
[2:16:01] <Idon__> Good call, Pat
[2:16:01] <thesugardaddy111> your right pat
[2:16:02] <%NopeBadguy> @rbakervv <3
[2:16:02] <%wydamn> dakuu75 die hard sony fanboys were super mad. As in, actually wishing that bayo 2 didn't exist mad.
[2:16:02] <%WhereIsWill> ohohoho
[2:16:02] <Kurrisum> I mean she was made by a woman so.....
[2:16:03] <Broken_Sonex> BOTH
[2:16:04] <penitentpendant> It's a trap
[2:16:04] <%lilytastic> tall girl hot
[2:16:04] <BleedinActionMan> @Gorotheninja Bro, you're like over a decade late with that
[2:16:05] <+pectusumbra> The simple answer is that people aren't monoliths
[2:16:05] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Sex-positive ones, most likely
[2:16:06] <+Goblinz_3> Yeah stay clear of that one LUL
[2:16:08] <+Over_ninek> call Paige and have her weigh in on it
[2:16:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Being that feminist are people, They have diverse opinions
[2:16:13] <+Promessa_EX> i think most don't care cuz they are busy whining that some people don't like ww84
[2:16:15] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> THE GLASSES STAY ON
[2:16:19] <rytisone> there are different levels of feminism
[2:16:21] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Ye
[2:16:21] <talokur29> @gorotheninja that’s highly in relevant.
[2:16:24] <%PerrinIsDead> REEEE SILENCE IS VIOLENCE PAT
[2:16:24] <rufus2k2> >feminists are people
[2:16:25] <+Gorotheninja> Fair Enough, Pat
[2:16:26] <%jessyg920> my wife overheard that and said "thats a very smart man."
[2:16:27] <dukenux> eh, her tiddies arent that big
[2:16:28] <thesugardaddy111> just get paige to weigh in on it
[2:16:29] <%cvp5127> yes
[2:16:29] <rufus2k2> jury's still out!
[2:16:31] <Stormo> it depends on the feminist
[2:16:31] <@SoFarFetched> Pretty much to each their own on how they see the Bayonetta series,and best to leave it at that.
[2:16:31] <Warbot40> depends on who you are
[2:16:31] <cherrycottontail> That's not what her design was
[2:16:37] <%wydamn> @jessyg920 LUL
[2:16:39] <talokur29> Indeed.
[2:16:41] <%FacetiousAF> her ass IS outta control Kreygasm
[2:16:42] <+pectusumbra> legs for years as well
[2:16:42] <%BoxNavy> ive seen bigger
[2:16:43] <danteftw20> dont forget the vynal
[2:16:43] <Mattais88> Dem Gams
[2:16:43] <+falineth> did pat just pretend to be holding two titties?
[2:16:45] <%SirGO0SE> @PatStaresAt it's Lady Gaga I think who LOVES her
[2:16:47] <CSeriesJTYPE> I was just reading a gamasutra article about how bayo is actually 100% about empowerment
[2:16:47] <xternalmega> bayonetta 3 when?
[2:16:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> could be bigger tho
[2:16:49] <thesugardaddy111> thats what I want in a woman
[2:16:49] <Twoiis> Do you prefer beehive or pixie hair cut Bayonetta?
[2:16:50] <+Promessa_EX> her tits are only big because she is big
[2:16:51] <%PerrinIsDead> I love me some big ass and big tiddy
[2:16:52] <Kadraxan> isn't there part of anLP in here?
[2:16:53] <%WhereIsWill> and the legs are insane
[2:16:54] <+PleasantLee> designed to be sexy, and designed to be sexy and strong. did no one think that they are one and the same
[2:16:54] <biglomix> She's made like a fashion drawing
[2:16:56] <primaryfire> they are pretty big
[2:16:57] <%PerrinIsDead> all that matters is ass
[2:16:59] <ミュウレ4242> guys getting off isn't inconpatable w/ chicks being powerful. there's no conflict.
[2:17:01] <rytisone> Platinum Ass
[2:17:02] <+Dova573> Eiterh way Bayo is badass and WILL KICK YOUR ASS
[2:17:02] <talokur29> Them thighs though.
[2:17:03] <+Over_ninek> the lesson is that female empowerment is attractive
[2:17:04] <+thegreenbenis> Ass that could legit cause injury.
[2:17:05] <leinadtonu> Fellas, is it gay to be sexist?
[2:17:05] <Kadraxan> behind the entrance?
[2:17:06] <%FacetiousAF> i prefer the pixie hair in 2
[2:17:07] <+JustToWatch> Pat, are you trying to say that you are not in fact one of the foremost feminist scholars?
[2:17:08] <+Gorotheninja> Her ass is indeed, on fleek
[2:17:09] <cherrycottontail> She was designed to be a criique on japanese culture by swinging hard into western fashion proportions
[2:17:11] <jumpyhugs> could be twintelle
[2:17:13] <Kurrisum> I mean she is quite skinny for how tall she is
[2:17:15] <CSeriesJTYPE> theres never any moment where bayo isnt in control of her sexual expression, is the point
[2:17:17] <Idon__> Her tits and ass are fine, but her limbs are long as FUCK.
[2:17:22] <jamsbybetty> USE IT
[2:17:25] <%Piemono> Bayo's pasture looks painful
[2:17:26] <xternalmega> KILLA QUEEN BITES ZA DUSTO
[2:17:27] <+epoladia> Even the lever pull I forgot lmao
[2:17:33] <%SirGO0SE> me love big woman :)
[2:17:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I wonder what kinda hair style they'll give her in 3
[2:17:35] <%PerrinIsDead> I wanna give Bayo my mayo
[2:17:37] <%Piemono> posture
[2:17:39] <+JustToWatch> CRAZY DIAMOND
[2:17:39] <ミュウレ4242> she clearly grew up w/o gravity.
[2:17:39] <jimmytwofeet> She's over seven foot tall
[2:17:44] <DrkJP520> Isn't there an item in this that just lets you trade it in for any skill in the shop?
[2:17:45] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Back in time
[2:17:47] <Pookiedaexzile> She can fly over it
[2:17:48] <%BoxNavy> what else is she gonna do? build a new one?
[2:17:49] <%bevyrage> this puzzle doesn't even come up that often afterwards either
[2:17:49] <huskarl_zap> Kamiya is a sub is the point
[2:17:51] <%wydamn> Kurrisum is she though? She has hips like a tree trunk
[2:17:51] <%mister___doctor> If you would bother to find out anything about feminism beyond what you hear from your friends people on the internet you would be able to form your own opinion on Bayonetta
[2:17:52] <Hydrapissed> ya know she could just summon a hair demon and fly over it
[2:17:53] <jamsbybetty> GET THE LP PAT
[2:17:54] <Hydrapissed> but shhhh
[2:17:57] <SilverFeng> time travel solves all problems
[2:17:59] <thesugardaddy111> what are u gonna do, build a new bridge?
[2:18:00] <primaryfire> just locally rewind time 4Head
[2:18:02] <jamsbybetty> phew
[2:18:03] <+Goblinz_3> Don't forget that lp in the distance pat Kappa
[2:18:07] <%Godlike_Turtle> @nopebadguy Holy shit man. That sucks. Even my hick ass state understands masks are necessary. Where are you at?
[2:18:11] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuck yeah
[2:18:19] <Blank9> yeahhhh
[2:18:20] <A_CD_By_Thomas> McDog
[2:18:26] <%arancet> is she dipping the fries in the sugar?
[2:18:29] <dukenux> If "Yaoi Hands" are Bayo's "Yuri Legs"?
[2:18:30] <+Goblinz_3> McDog LUL
[2:18:30] <%Ironbuttz> Replaying DQ11 DE atm, and forgot how relaxing it is to play.
[2:18:32] <%BoxNavy> McDough
[2:18:33] <%SirGO0SE> Paige is the foremost authority on feminism, what does she think?
[2:18:33] <%WutangchickeN> ITS THE QUEEN OF WAC ARNOLD'S
[2:18:34] <thesugardaddy111> cuz magic
[2:18:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Bayonetta was born in the CLAMP yaoi dimension
[2:18:43] <+MayorRev> HELLO TODAY
[2:18:43] <dukenux> yeah i like this
[2:18:47] <Hydrapissed> @dukenux you nailed it
[2:18:52] <%OswaldTheDog> hello today!!!
[2:19:01] <%Monkeyweed21> cant bayonetta just fly?
[2:19:02] <Pookiedaexzile> The internet has a way of making everything worse
[2:19:08] <dukenux> Paige, as a representant of all vvymyn, is Bayonetta feminism?
[2:19:16] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeah
[2:19:22] <%SirGO0SE> panther go brrrr
[2:19:25] <rytisone> like sonic
[2:19:27] <%Monkeyweed21> the weapons aren't timelocked @PatStaresAt
[2:19:28] <DrkJP520> pillowtalk?
[2:19:28] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Especially once you get that panther
[2:19:28] <cherubs_anonymous> You're shmoovin
[2:19:46] <%weissguard> Panther Within makes you flipping go, man.
[2:19:48] <Udongein_1> might be an accessory
[2:19:50] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Angy lava
[2:19:50] <Pookiedaexzile> So are you saying that Bayo is Shadow the Hedgehogs mother
[2:19:51] <%weissguard> Just zoom all over
[2:19:51] <%wydamn> @monkeyonsticks she gets that ability later on
[2:19:58] <+Gorotheninja> Sai Fung takes too much time to unlock
[2:20:01] <%Grimlockfly> always die there because i'd jump before qte
[2:20:08] <+Cobaltor_252> why is the lava screaming
[2:20:16] <%Monkeyweed21> the weapons are from doing hard and climax, not time locked @PatStaresAt
[2:20:16] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeah
[2:20:21] <mycoldshoulder> Sai Fung is tight tho
[2:20:22] <+thegreenbenis> Jesus Bayonetta could break someone's neck with how hard she wiggles when she walks.
[2:20:24] <Idon__> Really? Even stuff like the katana?
[2:20:25] <penitentpendant> Someone sounds like they're either flexing or having Montezuma's Revenge in the background
[2:20:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bayo 2's better about that at least
[2:20:30] <heartlesshealer> it's pretty nice
[2:20:31] <Vyneci> You're probably thinking of the Bracelet of Time by beating the game under 3 hours in total verse time
[2:20:34] <%OswaldTheDog> the lava sounds like it needs a ricola
[2:20:38] <huskarl_zap> man who died from lava "oh no the lavas hurting me"
[2:20:43] <+skeletonmilk> do you like or dislike that the weapons have that similarity between them?
[2:20:51] <%Monkeyweed21> the gunchuks you get by doing 100 missions
[2:20:51] <thesugardaddy111> so dmc and bayo are in the same universe?
[2:20:52] <%AzureGale> Hawt
[2:20:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Pillow Talk is my fav
[2:20:58] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Ye
[2:21:02] <heartlesshealer> Yup!
[2:21:02] <+Over_ninek> i struggle to understand how my younger self managed to do those challenges
[2:21:04] <heartlesshealer> Waka
[2:21:09] <thetruenicster> It was also the name of a track in DMC 1
[2:21:09] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt dont forget the gunchuks
[2:21:12] <BleedinActionMan> PillowTalk is such a cool name for a weapon
[2:21:12] <%SirGO0SE> theres a lot of love in it
[2:21:17] <talokur29> It’s awesome
[2:21:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Until Wonderful 101 WAS Paltinum All Stars
[2:21:19] <Hydrapissed> red hot kick
[2:21:22] <TioXyco> that's a reverse rider kick, pat
[2:21:23] <Pookiedaexzile> So when are we gonna get a hard confirm on Jeanne being Neros mother
[2:21:23] <NeroIscariot12> This game was Clover all stars
[2:21:23] <+Gorotheninja> The Sai Fung recquires you to beat 100 chapters.
[2:21:26] <%kewlmyc> You know Anarchy Reigns exist right?
[2:21:26] <+PleasantLee> this game was made at a time that platinum were the only ones who would celebrate themselves
[2:21:27] <%wydamn> @canadiananimatorguy true
[2:21:31] <grimporio> what do you mean? TW101 is platinum all-stars
[2:21:33] <%juxtest> Throw in a W101 mask too why the fuck not
[2:21:39] <PabstBlueFalcon> God so many dead people
[2:21:39] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Not to mention all the other references, like Luca's "girls"
[2:21:42] <thesugardaddy111> I do remember that
[2:21:42] <dukenux> It's Kamiya's dear baby(not the dearest, that'd be W101)
[2:21:45] <Hydrapissed> I remember her being like nah I can keep going
[2:21:46] <$Afterman_> thats every day
[2:21:46] <%walternatorz> poor paige's hands
[2:21:47] <@SoFarFetched> Bayonetta destroyed paige's hands
[2:21:48] <heartlesshealer> rip wrists
[2:21:50] <%WhereIsWill> the OLDE LROE
[2:21:51] <Pookiedaexzile> No we don't because Paige is Big and Strong
[2:21:52] <huskarl_zap> Is there an achievement called "Edge lord" for beating the game with no climaxes?
[2:21:58] <%weissguard> ooooh
[2:21:58] <+Promessa_EX> is that like the 8 hour mark
[2:22:00] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, Paige got THIS far? I thought she tapped out way before
[2:22:05] <%FacetiousAF> boss FIIIIIYYYYGHT
[2:22:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige decided not to play more she didn't break

[2:24:18] <Vyneci> Yeah I got really confused when you said this was your favorite one LUL
[2:24:19] <%OswaldTheDog> sneke whip
[2:24:21] <%king_wragles> The whip is cool.... but it's almost entirely worthless
[2:24:21] <thesugardaddy111> its a whip and a snake, how can you hate it.
[2:24:22] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Were you talking about the claws?
[2:24:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Whips seem cool though
[2:24:25] <Idon__> time for the SHOULDER
[2:24:31] <Blank9> I thought it was skates
[2:24:32] <KeiPrime> YEEEA
[2:24:33] <paralars_> claws are next
[2:24:33] <TioXyco> yeah, buy that tetsucabra skill
[2:24:34] <%king_wragles> Yo, mine too
[2:24:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Bayo seems more like a riding crop person than a whip person
[2:24:39] <thesugardaddy111> use cool poison whip
[2:24:39] <%king_wragles> ... I don't like this
[2:24:40] <@SoFarFetched> SoFarFetched subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! Want to say thanks for keeping me entertained this entire year. I rarely missed a stream thanks to COVID. Did you have a favorite/least favorite stream/LP you did this year? (besides Y7 & CP2077 geefPlz )
[2:24:41] <ergulor> don't you get the claws after the pair of beast?
[2:24:41] <+Cobaltor_252> that weapon is good for like 1 Alfheim and that's it
[2:24:42] <%BestTeaMaker> oh, i thought claws came later when you have to fight those fire/ice guys
[2:24:43] <heartlesshealer> whip is good crowd though at least
[2:24:50] <+Gorotheninja> Claws are so much fun
[2:24:53] <dukenux> @PatStaresAt just curious, and a bit off topic. What's your favorite side weapon in Revengeance?
[2:24:55] <%the22cstomp> by claws you mean Not Agni And Rudra?
[2:24:55] <LVL1_Scumbag> I would like to rock the dragon
[2:25:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Look, the first boss of Wonderful 101 @PatStaresAt
[2:25:14] <mycoldshoulder> sword is honestly OP
[2:25:23] <MetalDeerS0LID> I like the ice skates and the rocket launchers
[2:25:23] <Calek> the best bayonetta weapons are the chainsaw swords in 2
[2:25:25] <BleedinActionMan> The Bazillions are a direct upgrade to the Pistols
[2:25:28] <+MayorRev> Juu'nen hayain da yo!
[2:25:29] <ArgentUndaCova> I dunno, the nunchaku is pretty damn neato though mopT
[2:25:40] <heartlesshealer> also love how all the angels are just demons with pretty armor
[2:25:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Both are pretty good
[2:25:55] <mycoldshoulder> Either sword with kilgore does big damage
[2:25:59] <Pookiedaexzile> This game gets the closest to biblical angel descriptions
[2:26:00] <Vyneci> Pillow Talk is fucking insane, but Shuraba's Wicked Weaves are pretty good too
[2:26:04] <+CookieCutter007> demons are boring
[2:26:08] <%Futurecity10> Pat didnt read any donations right?
[2:26:09] <Idon__> Wait a minute... are all the Angels just Mundus from DMC1?
[2:26:14] <dan_g_v> organic vs manufactured
[2:26:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> robot parts
[2:26:20] <thesugardaddy111> it makes sense because angels aren't beautiful in the actual Bible
[2:26:20] <+Over_ninek> yup
[2:26:21] <+OmegaWeltall> well yea biblicaly accurate angels are FUGGEN wierd lookin
[2:26:21] <%AncelDeLambert> they're mechanical
[2:26:22] <Udongein_1> more mechanical
[2:26:23] <dukenux> huh
[2:26:24] <+Gorotheninja> Press the Lollipop button, Pat!

[2:26:36] <heartlesshealer> Ooooh, never noticed the geometric shapes on the demons. I need a refresher course <3
[2:26:36] <MechNexus> she said the thing
[2:26:38] <+epoladia> Almost Eva angles?
[2:26:38] <+Cobaltor_252> SHE SAID THE THING
[2:26:40] <thetruenicster> OH Hey, It;s Dante's Line
[2:26:41] <LVL1_Scumbag> I clapped
[2:26:43] <%jessyg920> She said the line!
[2:26:43] <rytisone> her serious mode
[2:26:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The enemy designs in these games are just fantastic
[2:26:44] <+froduck42> order covrering chaos and chaos covering order
[2:26:44] <%beepbeepbopbop> Didn't they do research on what the angels were meant to look like as well?
[2:26:45] <super_robo_mg> She said the thing that Dante said!
[2:26:46] <%weissguard> YEYEYE
[2:26:47] <DianaTheAscian> she said the thing
[2:26:48] <primaryfire> yoo dmc1 reference
[2:26:49] <bubbli97> isnt that a Dante line?
[2:26:50] <%BoxNavy> biggonetta
[2:26:51] <NitronStreams> OH Shit SHE LETTIN HER HAIR DOWN
[2:26:58] <thesugardaddy111> angels are super ugly and itd hard for humans to comprehend what they see
[2:27:03] <+Wizardism> bayo got a puffy beaf
[2:27:04] <+Gorotheninja> Flock Off Pat
[2:27:07] <A_CD_By_Thomas> SUPLEX
[2:27:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bayo handicaps herself because it's more fun that way :)
[2:27:10] <Laecerelius> TWIST HIS DICK!
[2:27:10] <BubbaRands> Demons are robots because they have no souls Kappa
[2:27:10] <+JustToWatch> RULES OF NATURE

[2:27:11] <cherubs_anonymous> GRAB HIS DICK AND TWIST IT\

[2:27:11] <%OswaldTheDog> Baranetta
[2:27:15] <%BoxNavy> kill that guys ass off
[2:27:15] <%FacetiousAF> c'mon bayyybaaayyyy and dooo the twist
[2:27:18] <pokefan9956> so if the main antagonist of 1 is from paradiso, main villain of 2 is related to the human world, will main villain of 3 be from inferno?
[2:27:20] <%Visorak6> GIVE HIM THE OL DICK TWIST
[2:27:24] <primaryfire> madama butterfly probably wouldn't be happy about having to do that all day

[2:27:38] <huskarl_zap> dicky twistet
[2:27:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> Essence of face twisting
[2:27:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Isn't Dante and Vergil trapped in Hell
[2:27:45] <Idon__> The main villain of 3 will be Bayonetta herself LUL
[2:27:47] <%JamesCorck> I recall a trick you can do during cutscenes, if you press a button of the color of the lollypop Bayo is holding on the cutscene, you get a lollypop of that color added to your inventory. I dunno if the new version will still have this.
[2:27:57] <dukenux> (i dont think angels have dicks, but whatever)
[2:27:57] <BubbaRands> Wednesday night dick twist fight!
[2:27:57] <%Futurecity10> damn pat you choke with that ass?
[2:28:01] <%BoxNavy> dont worry bayonetta 3s development is going smooth :)
[2:28:02] <+Ether101_Prime> I wonder if Bayo 3 will have her unlocking her light powers as the Anthony Redgrave's notes imply she would have.
[2:28:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Bayo is on 3, and DMC is on 6
[2:28:03] <Giztech> sword beam?
[2:28:05] <BleedinActionMan> @JamesCorck it does
[2:28:08] <%BoxNavy> they said so themselves
[2:28:09] <%AncelDeLambert> QTE time
[2:28:09] <+pectusumbra> @pokefan9956 Assuming that line and 3 taking so long because of that, I bet you'd fight your butterfly demon probably
[2:28:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Bayo is the villian in DMC 6 confirmed
[2:28:16] <+stickygumbolee> This is some pro gamer shit happening
[2:28:22] <%JamesCorck> @BleedinActionMan Oh cool!

[2:29:15] <BleedinActionMan> @Pookiedaexzile God, that would be so rad

[2:38:41] <%SirGO0SE> Kreygasm
[2:38:45] <+stickygumbolee> Bayo 2 had more interesting weapons
[2:38:45] <%Metaknightmarex> Can't you use it like Devil Bringer?
[2:38:46] <+MayorRev> why do they call ya mikey two-feet? "cause of my lip"
[2:38:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bayo 2 Whip is amazing
[2:38:49] <+battlebeast67> The whip is good for crowd control
[2:38:55] <huskarl_zap> mod him so he can spam post his feet pics folder everywhere
[2:38:57] <highfivesquash> looks like you can combo whip into boot
[2:39:01] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Why you gotta skip all the lore, Pat
[2:39:01] <+Gorotheninja> Alruna BAEBE
[2:39:08] <%jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Lore time with Pat
[2:39:09] <thesugardaddy111> and then 2 of them fucked and broke the rules and Bayonetta was born
[2:39:15] <VritraReiRei> decent for juggling airborne enemies at least

[2:39:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> yes
[2:39:41] <NitronStreams> any whip that doesnt just turn the game into God of War is an inferior whip
[2:39:41] <+OmegaWeltall> kinda Kappa
[2:39:44] <MetalDeerS0LID> stun them, then attack with a press and hold
[2:39:46] <+Ether101_Prime> Most important place in the franchise.

[2:41:05] <%AncelDeLambert> no it isn't, you just aren't doing anything fun with it
[2:41:06] <+pectusumbra> I mean it looks like it's doing work. Pulling that guy out of the air was sick
[2:41:07] <heartlesshealer> then get the claws faster
[2:41:13] <anuchallengertwitch> I like to imagine that these guys are like hype dude bros in their personalities. Like everytime they're ready to fight bayo they're like " Let's fucking GOOOOOO"
[2:41:14] <Laecerelius> Use the power of the kaytanner
[2:41:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Tellin ya, Bayo strikes me as a Riding crop woman
[2:41:14] <ScreamLord> He says as he totally decimates 2 of the hardest enemies in the game with it
[2:41:17] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Remember how hard mode's Toture Attack tutorial makes you fight Gracious and Glorious? That was a rough time
[2:41:30] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Will you stream Bayo 2 when you're done with Bayo 1?
[2:41:31] <BubbaRands> STYLIN PogChamp

[2:46:44] <cherrycottontail> Luka is probably one of the coolest designs to ever be a huge loser
[2:46:48] <BleedinActionMan> I love how he grapples away
[2:46:55] <+Ether101_Prime> Luca's swings off like Spider-Man.
[2:46:57] <BleedinActionMan> that's such a nice detail
[2:47:00] <leinadtonu> Hope he doesn't like nekopara...
[2:47:00] <s1rcuit> the names of angel types in this is interesting, can't figure out if there's a pattern though

[2:47:23] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah, Luka looks so cool for such a huge loser
[2:47:30] <zenith0111> Bloodborne enemy
[2:47:44] <greasystreams> Luka is the Yamcha
[2:47:49] <mycoldshoulder> its isnt fair for luka to be in this game
[2:47:49] <talokur29> Looks like the party is just getting started. BCWarrior
[2:47:50] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt Why arent you using the link costume with automatic Moon of mahakala?
[2:47:55] <+mrredwednesday> sbfpSetIn
[2:47:57] <greasystreams> He’s cool in isolation but useless everywhere else
[2:48:01] <s1rcuit> @leinadtonu nekopara is a shameless pedo/furry dating sim
[2:48:03] <LVL1_Scumbag> If only there were an item
[2:48:04] <%wydamn> cherrycottontail compared to most of the characters in this game he is kind of a loser, but to be fair he's also a normal human that's able to follow Bayo around through an angel apocalypse so he's actually kind of a bad ass.
[2:48:04] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Damn
[2:48:05] <heartlesshealer> because costume
[2:48:06] <%FacetiousAF> it DOES look like shit

[2:48:09] <%SirGO0SE> it'd be funny tho :)
[2:48:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Calling Luka Yamcha is a little far
[2:48:10] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> rude
[2:48:11] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So until later Luka has no idea Angles even exist, right? So what does he think Bayonetta is doing right now? As far as he can tell Bayo is just freaking out right now
[2:48:14] <+Joe2187> THEN USE THE CHEATS TO GET MOON OF MAHAKALA FOR FREE!
[2:48:15] <Bladethrine> Why not taunt then?

[2:49:02] <zenith0111> This reminds me of Suda51 style
[2:49:06] <%SaiyanShoto> I like Luka but god damn do I hate Loki in Bayo 2
[2:49:13] <%Dakuu75> Hey niki you so fine, you so fine you blow my mind, hey niki~
[2:49:15] <+chiazam> These enemy monster designs are so sick
[2:49:15] <%Monkeyweed21> how heavy is Bayo?
[2:49:18] <huskarl_zap> nice cow?
[2:49:19] <heartlesshealer> yeah too many wicked weaves destroys the platform I guess
[2:49:22] <+wydamn> screamlord so Luka can't see the angels, and bayo can't interact with angels without phasing into their plane of existence, and when she does luka can't see her either
[2:49:23] <Noogiez> butthole stiletto dance
[2:49:29] <highfivesquash> Can you imagine having a tuba instead of a head? Bayonetta is doing them a duty here damn
[2:49:30] <Broken_Sonex> I wonder what Luka sees when this shit is happening
[2:49:42] <%weissguard> @wydamn Enzo stops appearing in the story after the prologue. Luka actually follows Bayo around during this stuff.
[2:49:53] <%wydamn> cherrycottontail nah, enzo's just a cockroach
[2:49:54] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt go to the phone booth in the second level to get items early
[2:50:01] <%Dakuu75> @Broken_Sonex Maybe craters, explosions, gun's muzzle flashes
[2:50:03] <+Promessa_EX> he did tuba sound
[2:50:09] <heartlesshealer> you can respawn that bird right now
[2:50:12] <BleedinActionMan> @wydamn and he does more than get his ass kicked
[2:50:12] <s1rcuit> @Broken_Sonex probably just a bunch of random shit breaking to random yells and cries of pain
[2:50:14] <talokur29> @patstaresat what is your worst nightmare? SeriousSloth
[2:50:18] <+chiazam> Wait, is Bayonetta a virgin?
[2:50:19] <ScreamLord> @wydamn Correct. You have to use magic to see and fight angles and demons
[2:50:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> Needs more RE valve noise
[2:50:31] <gustavozxd> they're expensive as fuck though
[2:50:31] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So until later Luka has no idea Angles even exist, right? So what does he think Bayonetta is doing right now? As far as he can tell Bayo is just freaking out right now
[2:50:31] <MetalDeerS0LID> you need like millions of halos for that
[2:50:36] <%Monkeyweed21> the cheat codes cost a few million each
[2:50:37] <Vyneci> Oh the cheat codes, you need millions of halos to do it though
[2:50:42] <Bladethrine> Do you dislike linkle's design too, or do you only dislike bayo-link.
[2:50:42] <+battlebeast67> He has to have money for that though
[2:50:43] <heartlesshealer> bird
[2:50:47] <+rbakervv> @Joe2187 that costs a lot of halos though
[2:50:50] <%SharkMissile> A LOT of money
[2:50:51] <%BoxNavy> that was awesome
[2:50:52] <heartlesshealer> bye forever, bird

[2:53:11] <BubbaRands> And you keep it too!
[2:53:12] <%Dakuu75> temporary weapon?
[2:53:17] <LVL1_Scumbag> oh cool
[2:53:19] <+Joe2187> Bayo 2 chainsaw is better
[2:53:20] <%WhereIsWill> thats dope
[2:53:26] <heartlesshealer> Doesn't Rodin make some comment about the chainsaws at some point?
[2:53:26] <+stickygumbolee> Chainsaws in 2 are great though
[2:53:29] <+epoladia> Oh because they don’t drop a weapon
[2:53:32] <%Piemen99> wait like forever?
[2:53:33] <%wydamn> dakuu75 yeah, it has a durability bar on the left
[2:53:44] <%Piemen99> oh
[2:53:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> God, I love the Bayo 2 chainsaws. Favorite weapon in that game
[2:53:48] <+battlebeast67> Ironically I don't find the chainsaw that useful in comparison to other angel arms.
[2:53:48] <%Deft_Thought> Huh. I didn't know Luka's last name was Redgrave
[2:53:50] <penitentpendant> The Claws?
[2:53:54] <+CookieCutter007> the bats?

[2:54:05] <BleedinActionMan> @heartlesshealer He says something like, "Before you ask, no, I'm not putting a chainsaw on your arm"
[2:54:06] <Laecerelius> I saw a chest to the left
[2:54:07] <%tank7013> That fog monster looks like one of those fuzzy worms that you pull on a string
[2:54:10] <zenith0111> Well your opinion is wrong :)

[2:54:23] <+Joe2187> Chainsaws in 2 become blade shoes and your run around like a motorcycle
[2:54:23] <heartlesshealer> @BleedinActionMan that's what it was, thanks
[2:54:27] <penitentpendant> Chat +1
[2:54:27] <%BoxNavy> you. did it.
[2:54:30] <%Deft_Thought> @wydamn Yeah. His dad was Antonio Redgrave
[2:54:30] <gustavozxd> it's so easy to miss things in this game
[2:54:33] <%FacetiousAF> at least platinum likes chainsaws
[2:54:34] <%weissguard> yeyeye
[2:54:34] <%jimjamstrawberryslamalam> 0.O

[2:54:58] <Blank9> I forget where it is though
[2:55:03] <+Joe2187> @gustavozxd You mean verses that you have to backtrack to
[2:55:05] <%QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Don't worry Pat, you're not always the wrongest. Woolie was super wrong about Constantine, he actually changed Rome's day of rest to conform with the Christians using Sunday because that's when jesus came back
[2:55:09] <dukenux> this is a weird mix of judeo-christian lore and nordic names
[2:55:10] <Saltmeisterr> WTF
[2:55:13] <%FacetiousAF> that's just a warhammer
[2:55:13] <Saltmeisterr> HE'S COOL
[2:55:16] <+battlebeast67> you don't get bats and the crow within until you complete the chapter.
[2:55:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> Look at this hero!

[2:55:27] <%ssjklyco> Our Door
[2:55:28] <Idon__> is he taunting LMAO
[2:55:28] <NitronStreams> Why is He so COOL tho!?
[2:55:30] <Broken_Sonex> We call these One Guys, One Hero
[2:55:30] <+ZomBarney> how many times you beat this game now?
[2:55:32] <ChungusQuest> SPESS MAHRENES
[2:55:33] <%pepzi_boyz> that guys sick
[2:55:34] <talokur29> Pat your a good singer what musical instrument would you play?
[2:55:38] <s1rcuit> that's a 3 star at least
[2:55:38] <dukenux> or something SM would have as their unit
[2:55:41] <%arcielardor> I feel attacked
[2:55:45] <%WhereIsWill> i love it, its great
[2:55:49] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Goddamn
[2:55:53] <ExpressNode> I just got some phishing email "from" Indian Netflix asking me to pay in Indian currency LUL
[2:55:55] <penitentpendant> Blood Angels? Appropriate color scheme.
[2:55:59] <huskarl_zap> more like warmachine
[2:56:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Chainssaws may be impractical weapons irl, but man are they cool, and Platinum *gets* that
[2:56:05] <BubbaRands> Ardor means enthusiasm or passion :)
[2:56:15] <DrkJP520> Everything has these Norse names, but the train clearly didn't go toward the Scandinavian countries.
[2:56:19] <+Joe2187> The shuraba is the best weapon
[2:56:23] <%Nero9341> they remind me of gallantmon crimson mode
[2:56:25] <%Fooguwu> period powers activate
[2:56:28] <+Ether101_Prime> What's everyone's opinion on Banjo-Kazooie and Blast Corps being announced for the Wii U Virtual Console?
[2:56:29] <dukenux> Flyyyyyy me to the mooooon
[2:56:33] <+Joe2187> because when you have a parry the shuraba has a perfect parry
[2:56:36] <%BoxNavy> cus its a sword :)
[2:56:38] <s1rcuit> he's either a champion of either a generic Khorn or Blood Angel marine
[2:56:41] <Vyneci> Its Wicked Weaves
[2:56:46] <%Monkeyweed21> just frame reality cut @PatStaresAt
[2:56:50] <gustavozxd> best weapon is the rocket launcher that breaks the game
[2:56:53] <@SSaryn> It's Wicked Weaves and Just Frames yeah.
[2:56:55] <BubbaRands> is a thword
[2:56:56] <+Ether101_Prime> It sure is the coolest weapon at the very lest.
[2:56:56] <+DoggyT> After your done WIth this Verse, head back down the Tower.
[2:57:00] <Blank9> The wicked weaves hit in a really wide sweep, making it great for crowd control.
[2:57:05] <%arcielardor> equip the ice skates and that katana becomes real neat
[2:57:07] <%Dakuu75> "Shrub" huh?
[2:57:15] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuckin' sliced
[2:57:19] <+Joe2187> The perfect parry does witch time even in Nonstop infinite climax...which disables witch time
[2:57:20] <talokur29> It’s a sword that does stuff which means it’s good.
[2:57:22] <Blank9> Also means since you hit a lot of enemies at once with PKP, you get a LOT of combo bonus from a single weave.
[2:57:22] <Udongein_1> the launcher wicked weaves are pretty fast too
[2:57:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's my favorite loadout
[2:57:30] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Skates and Katana is an awesome combo
[2:57:33] <+DoggyT> NO PAt REALLY head back DOWN the tower.
[2:57:37] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:57:40] <combobreaks> Bayonetta step on my balls please
[2:57:42] <@SSaryn> Still love Katana and Fairs myself but hey.
[2:57:42] <+battlebeast67> Ice skates are kinda underrated.
[2:57:44] <%Monkeyweed21> does pat know the claw bazooka glitch?
[2:57:54] <+DoggyT> YOU MISSED A SECERT VERSE!!
[2:57:55] <Blank9> ice skates are cool
[2:57:57] <BleedinActionMan> There's stuff up there

[2:58:37] <%arcielardor> it's complicated but if pulled off, you macross missle everything
[2:58:40] <%BoxNavy> is it the exploit that gets you a lotta halos?
[2:58:43] <Blank9> pat would NEVER use that glitch

[2:59:26] <%Dakuu75> CHECK MA PECKS~!!! hi-ha-hu~
[2:59:37] <+Gorotheninja> I just love how Bayo's weapons give you so much freedom and variety in your playstyle. Its something that I feel newer DMC games are missing.
[2:59:41] <+battlebeast67> Parry helps too
[2:59:41] <+Birdigalore> Man, I'm pretty!
[2:59:42] <%BoxNavy> you need it batly :)
[2:59:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @chiazam There are items, but only cowards use items
[2:59:56] <BleedinActionMan> @chiazam There's a treasure that heals you when you taunt enemies
[2:59:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @chiazam for bayo 1 you cant regain health unless you bitch out and use items
[2:59:57] <+Joe2187> The best way to beat these guys is to kill the red ones with a torture attack and use the charge move of their angel weapon
[2:59:57] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Have you done the True Final Millenium Tower yet
[3:00:11] <%YakumoYomi> C A K E

[3:01:25] <+battlebeast67> It's not that hard if you use the PPKKK combo
[3:01:34] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt To clear this one, kill red with a torture attack, then use the angel weapon charge move to finish off blue
[3:01:37] <%brachydios777> How is the ginger baby doing?
[3:01:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I don't think the limited attack Alfheims are the worst, but they are definitely antithetical to my normal playstyle
[3:01:40] <%BoxNavy> wow

[3:01:49] <combobreaks> @patstaresat have you ever tried the thunder juggle to finish this one?
[3:02:16] <talokur29> @dakuu75 I can’t either but I know we both can do crazy button smash combos though on a controller.
[3:02:28] <+battlebeast67> Lol Pat missed like several alhiems. Don't blame him they're kinda hard if you don't know what to do.

[3:03:53] <%FacetiousAF> you gon get it
[3:03:54] <+skeletonmilk> this game feels like you need to go as far back as possible in each level every time you beat a fight to check for alfheims and lps

[3:12:29] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat, notorious fan of fisting weapons
[3:12:36] <+skeletonmilk> It physically hurts me these aren't in Bayo 2.
[3:12:42] <%Monkeyweed21> you can also hit fire enemies out of witch time
[3:12:45] <%ggbhtg> Is this a King Cerebus or a Beowulf? @PatStaresAt

[3:13:44] <+battlebeast67> Hey Pat go back down to where you fought the first Inspired there's an extra verse there.

[3:15:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I dunno, could be a RPS situation where Sephiroth > Bayo > Sora > Sephiroth
[3:15:24] <%wydamn> drkjp520, you think that's bad, there's a fucking stupid one just like that in one of the final levels of Astral Chain
[3:15:28] <+chiazam> Or just look up a guide
[3:15:31] <FunkyTK> Yeah, realizing that every time you play this level you skip a verse and then looking for it
[3:15:32] <fuji_92> theres so many dumb verses, you dont even know dude who said that
[3:15:35] <litreofcola_> Cheer500 Oh man I've seen bayo gameplay now I gotta go play it again. Love you Pat
[3:15:35] <huskarl_zap> Hedki Kamiyia didnt shake woolie's hand just like Daigo did not
[3:15:36] <DrkJP520> Just check every corner adn crevice of every level multiple times
[3:15:36] <litreofcola_> litreofcola_'s Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[3:15:36] <+battlebeast67> Hey man Wonderful 101 is the same way. That's Kamiya for ya.
[3:15:37] <%baka_sugoi> look for shinny's
[3:15:42] <Mattais88> I think I played every level 3-5 times trying to find everything before moving on to he next.
[3:15:43] <+Over_ninek> i feel like note taking falling off early in video game history was a net loss
[3:15:54] <%ggbhtg> Actual "check dose cornas" meme goes here
[3:15:54] <Saltmeisterr> Oh yeah
[3:16:03] <BubbaRands> pew pew pew
[3:16:04] <%WhereIsWill> pat get jacket up
[3:16:08] <fuji_92> yikes
[3:16:33] <LeadBoxes> Hes been practicing for the montage
[3:16:44] <DrkJP520> is ok
[3:16:51] <%RetroCop87> s'alright, you're still doing better than me
[3:16:55] <%FacetiousAF> you're gonna slaughter bayo 2
[3:16:57] <+battlebeast67> Dude, don't worry about it.
[3:16:58] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt will you do the secret boss?
[3:17:02] <fuji_92> sure they will
[3:17:03] <%the22cstomp> poor torture attacks
[3:17:05] <DrkJP520> Doesn't torture attacks restore hp in 2?
[3:17:14] <pancake_madness> Doesn't Bayo 2 have all the weapons from Bayo 1?
[3:17:14] <%Grimlockfly> Bayo literally gets gud in Bayo 2
[3:17:17] <+HeroSolaire> is Bayo 2 emulation pitch perfect chat?
[3:17:20] <%BoxNavy> then do it tho
[3:17:24] <+chiazam> No time like the present then
[3:17:24] <+HeroSolaire> like botw?
[3:17:24] <%ggbhtg> is the secret boss that Starfox thing?
[3:17:27] <%FacetiousAF> obligatory I AM THE STORM THAT IS APPROACHING
[3:17:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @pancake_madness not durga
[3:17:30] <+Joe2187> gridning for halos would take like ten hours
[3:17:30] <Bladethrine> After 2 are you going to play 101?
[3:17:32] <%SGrim> Temprence?
[3:17:34] <%FacetiousAF> and THIS GUY was my favorite fight
[3:17:35] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Da big guy
[3:17:36] <+battlebeast67> @pancake_madness No.
[3:17:37] <BleedinActionMan> @DrkJP520 I think it makes them drop heealing items
[3:17:46] <%miabyte> miabyte subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Yo Pat, how goes the bayonetta-ing. You planning on doing number 2 after this? Can't believe this sexy mf ever made it into smash. Glad she did though. *cries in lack of dante*
[3:17:49] <%TheBensonator_> psaBig bitch
[3:17:50] <%FacetiousAF> yeah temp
[3:17:50] <%ggbhtg> HAYAI
[3:17:51] <%AzureGale> GOTTA GO FAST
[3:17:54] <+battlebeast67> Jeanne fight 2
[3:17:55] <%BoxNavy> too bad theres no way to do that ever
[3:17:56] <%baka_sugoi> gatta go fast
[3:17:57] <BubbaRands> IF ONLY
[3:17:58] <DrkJP520> Embrace the furry within!
[3:17:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @pancake_madness Not all, it's missing Durga but has a similar weapon, but most of the weapons from 1 are unlockable
[3:18:00] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Why are all the Jeanne & Lumen Sage fights so uniquely fuckin' good, Platinum's a masterclass at rival fights
[3:18:17] <pancake_madness> They took out the best one in 2?!
[3:18:24] <+battlebeast67> Jeanne is so fun to fight against.
[3:18:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @pancake_madness yea but all the other weapons get even better
[3:18:45] <BleedinActionMan> @A_CD_By_Thomas because you're fighting an equal instead of jobbers
[3:18:49] <ScreamLord> Kinda?
[3:18:51] <AngryPhant0m> I think a lot of people (including me) didn't play B2 because it was on the WiiU
[3:18:55] <dukenux> hey
[3:18:59] <dukenux> it's Vergal
[3:19:07] <+chiazam> Jeanne want smoke
[3:19:09] <%wydamn> Bayo 2 is also on the switch
[3:19:09] <huskarl_zap> john represent internalized misogyny
[3:19:14] <xanerts> was that a vergil joke?
[3:19:14] <+Birdigalore> Best Song #1
[3:19:16] <%baka_sugoi> aren't they kinda?
[3:19:18] <pokefan9956> real shit
[3:19:23] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @BleedinActionMan True
[3:19:27] <+chiazam> Oh how'd you do that
[3:19:28] <%OswaldTheDog> man jeanne is totally the top in that relationship
[3:19:30] <%the22cstomp> i love dmc3!
[3:19:33] <+Over_ninek> this was the hypest shit
[3:19:35] <BubbaRands> yes yes yes yes
[3:19:39] <DrkJP520> Imagine if bayonetta just ate that bullet and died
[3:19:42] <%baka_sugoi> DMC but with WOMANs
[3:19:42] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:19:44] <+battlebeast67> @pancake_madness oh 2 has some chessier weapons than Durga though. So I don't know if how useful it would have been 2.
[3:19:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Honestly, the lack of Durga is seriously my only complaint about Bayo 2, but that isn't a super big deal
[3:19:49] <%AzureGale> Hawt
[3:19:51] <%dapperdoop> kick fight
[3:19:51] <%wydamn> doesn't this music sound really similar to Devil's Never Cry from DMC3?
[3:19:52] <%Piemen99> Why aren't their shirts off?
[3:19:52] <%Monkeyweed21> @OswaldTheDog Bayo is power bottom then
[3:19:54] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Feels like it
[3:19:55] <mister_z_1994> Oh absolutely
[3:19:56] <%jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Vergil looks weird in red
[3:19:57] <+chiazam> Aw yeah, gun kata that makes no sense but looks cool as shit
[3:19:59] <%Deft_Thought> Man, Bayonetta is great
[3:20:00] <huskarl_zap> Shirtless in the rain
[3:20:01] <%ssjklyco> But they arent shirtless in the rain
[3:20:01] <talokur29> CAT Fight!
[3:20:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's gotta be
[3:20:03] <+Sargonyx> But they're not shirtless
[3:20:03] <%RetroCop87> but the rain doesn't get sliced
[3:20:04] <dukenux> Shirtless in the rain
[3:20:05] <%the22cstomp> it's an extreme dmc3 reference
[3:20:06] <DianaTheAscian> prob
[3:20:07] <rytisone> naked in the rain
[3:20:07] <$Afterman_> too bad they arent fighting shirtless
[3:20:10] <heartlesshealer> it's so good
[3:20:12] <fuji_92> shirtless
[3:20:17] <%baka_sugoi> its a kamiya game so probably
[3:20:18] <MetalDeerS0LID> Dante and Vergil fighting shirtless in the rain
[3:20:18] <+IrishWeegee> yeah on the terrimigru or whatever
[3:20:19] <%Deft_Thought> I never played Bayo 2 because I didn't have a Wii U
[3:20:23] <%the22cstomp> technically bayo is shirtless, she's wearing hair
[3:20:24] <+chiazam> Jeanne is pretty hot too
[3:20:24] <BubbaRands> Too bad they aren't shirtless...
[3:20:25] <ChungusQuest> "Kickfighting like you've never seen before!"
[3:20:25] <+Gorotheninja> Yeah, but they're not shirtless
[3:20:27] <%radda343> wait so is she bayo's vergil or her wife
[3:20:30] <huskarl_zap> Inspired by episode 3 revenge of the sith
[3:20:32] <Mattais88> But they're not cats yet? Tht's the end of the fight
[3:20:32] <DrkJP520> this song!
[3:20:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bayo 2 has a Switch port now too
[3:20:37] <Broken_Sonex> If only they were this entertaining
[3:20:37] <%dapperdoop> SourPls
[3:20:38] <%juxtest> Jeane and Bayo are so cool

[3:21:16] <%FacetiousAF> no gale the smash bros stage is the opening of the prologue
[3:21:17] <mister_z_1994> @AzureGale No that's the opening of this game
[3:21:18] <greasystreams> Pat getting blown out LUL LUL LUL
[3:21:19] <%wydamn> @azuregale no, that is from the very beginning of the game
[3:21:21] <+cowkid222> fantastic impact sounds
[3:21:22] <%juxtest> Now shes doing the move you did to her on you
[3:21:24] <MetalDeerS0LID> Pat got stoned

[3:21:26] <Vcom7418> @PatStaresAt Easy mode is now unlocked
[3:21:29] <pilllowofbees> @AzureGale the stage happens early in the game
[3:21:32] <Jonrskittles> pat gets stoned?

[3:21:36] <ScreamLord> What's worse than Stone?
[3:21:37] <pokefan9956> easy mode is now selectable?
[3:21:39] <gangstahotline> is this shadow moses island
[3:21:40] <%baka_sugoi> psaUp needs more style
[3:21:42] <Blank9> I like that you only get witch time off of dodging her biggest attacks.
[3:21:43] <%miabyte> hahahaha, why am I cursed to live in the UK. I am stoneless
[3:21:43] <+Sargonyx> Bayonetta is such a cool, original character concept. haven't seen anything like her in years.
[3:21:44] <%Grimlockfly> Pat Stone Stream
[3:21:46] <+Birdigalore> YEEEE ENZO TROPHY INC
[3:21:48] <@SSaryn> Checkpoints.
[3:21:49] <@SSaryn> Yep.
[3:21:50] <%AzureGale> I see, thanks
[3:21:50] <BubbaRands> You were guaranteed stone at 2 deaths LUL
[3:21:50] <%sighphers> this game has sonic rings
[3:21:53] <+Gorotheninja> All swagger, all substance
[3:21:59] <MetalDeerS0LID> the QTE's in 1 are also awful
[3:22:00] <dukenux> yea...
[3:22:04] <@SSaryn> Bayo 2 fixes literally everything about that at least.
[3:22:05] <%Grimlockfly> The QTEs, period
[3:22:07] <%Monkeyweed21> it also REFUSES to let you heal at all @PatStaresAt
[3:22:13] <Vcom7418> This really makes me wanna replay Bayo 1 (I played it for the first time to the finish this year)
[3:22:21] <talokur29> @miabyte but you’re lucky to live in the UK. You’re country full of stones.
[3:22:23] <marvel877> I'd more so complain about the QTEs above all else in 1.
[3:22:25] <greasystreams> QTEs in an action game PauseChamp
[3:22:26] <%sighphers> did jeanne just say begone?
[3:22:27] <DrkJP520> What's the name of Jeanne's demon again?
[3:22:30] <%TalisKanju> Is this the first time Pat is playing Bayonetta on stream?
[3:22:43] <%wydamn> Monkeyweed21, you can totally heal, if you're a loser that uses items
[3:22:48] <+battlebeast67> I think they're fine in comparison to W101's checkpoints. I found those more ergerious.
[3:22:48] <%SirGO0SE> why heal when you can just not get hit 4head
[3:22:53] <pokefan9956> ORA

[3:23:42] <ergulor> i prefer the long hair
[3:23:43] <+cowkid222> agreed
[3:23:44] <s1rcuit> her hair's certainly better
[3:23:45] <%BoxNavy> yes
[3:23:46] <Vcom7418> Bayo 2 design is better. Bayo 1 design makes more sense lore wise
[3:23:47] <@SSaryn> Agreed
[3:23:48] <%weissguard> YEAH
[3:23:49] <DrkJP520> yes
[3:23:50] <%BoxNavy> WAAAU

[3:23:52] <Broken_Sonex> Ehhhh, i prefer the beehive
[3:23:53] <+chiazam> Short hair
[3:23:53] <%Visorak6> short hair master race
[3:23:54] <+Thomzzz> i prefer bayo 1 design
[3:23:54] <SomeAsianDood> I mean duh
[3:23:54] <BlueLunecy> Bayo rocks the short hair
[3:23:56] <DianaTheAscian> its way better
[3:23:57] <greasystreams> I can go with either or
[3:23:57] <%FacetiousAF> YEAH butterfly WITHIN
[3:23:57] <@SoFarFetched> I forgot that in 2 Bayo and Jeanne switch hairstyles of long vs short
[3:23:58] <%baka_sugoi> I like short hair bayo
[3:23:58] <NitronStreams> I prefer Bayo's 2 hair but 1 outfit
[3:24:07] <dukenux> eh its fine
[3:24:07] <heartlesshealer> greater percentage of improvement, yeah
[3:24:07] <Blank9> bayo 2 did great design upgrades
[3:24:09] <%juxtest> Ridiculous hair tower Bayo is superior
[3:24:10] <+Over_ninek> WAIT can i do that?
[3:24:10] <%BoxNavy> yo dog thats crazy
[3:24:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's rad!
[3:24:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Bayo 1 Jeanne looks exactly like my dad's ex its weird @PatStaresAt
[3:24:18] <%wydamn> Bayonetta is basically Taskmaster
[3:24:18] <%Futurecity10> personally bayo's design in bayo 1 repulses me
[3:24:19] <dukenux> but i get why they changed it
[3:24:19] <%jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Meow
[3:24:21] <gangstahotline> snail down

[3:24:24] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuck yeah
[3:24:24] <huskarl_zap> Somethings wrong with that dog
[3:24:27] <%weissguard> It's the kind of cut that a Super Model from way back in the day would have. Nothing wrong with it, but Jeanne with long hair is great.
[3:24:27] <DrkJP520> Imagine if Bayo turned into an elephant or something
[3:24:29] <mister_z_1994> Kamiya be like "I got ya homie"
[3:24:30] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:24:30] <%FacetiousAF> meow :3
[3:24:31] <@SSaryn> Praise Kamiya
[3:24:32] <+battlebeast67> I agree like the haircut of Bayo 2 but I like the outfit of 1 more.

[3:26:15] <%FacetiousAF> He would need to grind off stream to get the Gaze
[3:26:15] <%jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Maaaaaaaaaaaaad
[3:26:15] <+chiazam> NO CHAINSAW?? BOOOOO
[3:26:18] <DejaraUndead> is pat confirming Jojo part 6 with all the Stone he is getting
[3:26:19] <huskarl_zap> Stone for rock cok
[3:26:21] <dukenux> No, it's be GROOVY
[3:26:22] <%the22cstomp> i love how they wink wink nudge nudge every platinum game
[3:26:25] <%BoxNavy> it would be pretty groovy though
[3:26:27] <%FacetiousAF> crow within is for a secret or two
[3:26:29] <+Gorotheninja> Good job, here's a trophy made of ROCKS
[3:26:30] <greasystreams> Grooooovy
[3:26:32] <@SSaryn> It's fine, it's better in Bayo 2.
[3:26:33] <huskarl_zap> Anarchy would reign
[3:26:34] <Saltmeisterr> haha anarchy reigns
[3:26:35] <Vcom7418> I found it useful in the end game
[3:26:37] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt You need it to get an LP piece somewhere
[3:26:39] <MetalDeerS0LID> the summon sword feathers use A LOT of magic
[3:26:41] <DrkJP520> crow is for reaching certain items
[3:26:42] <+Over_ninek> you need it for a few challenge iirc?
[3:26:42] <talokur29> Chainsaw go Brrrrrrrrerreerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrw.
[3:26:44] <%baka_sugoi> Vergal lol
[3:26:45] <%the22cstomp> summon sparrows
[3:26:46] <Vyneci> Crow Within unlocks "Umbran Spear" which is basically Vergil's teleport to an enemy
[3:26:47] <%FacetiousAF> haha anarchy reigns FeelsBadMan
[3:26:48] <+battlebeast67> It's super useful. Try Umbra Spear.
[3:26:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's mostly for secrets, though the Summon Feathers are fun
[3:26:51] <%Ranryu692> oh that's just Pet Shop
[3:26:52] <Udongein_1> Umbran Spear though is good
[3:26:54] <heartlesshealer> It gives you the ability to reach a specific Alfheim
[3:26:55] <OmniSTylez> she needs mroe power
[3:26:58] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt and it also unlocks Umbran Spear, which is awesome
[3:27:01] <greasystreams> Literally Summon Swords
[3:27:05] <huskarl_zap> Jack murder death kill feom the Anarchy Reigns series
[3:27:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh yeah, Umbran Spear is great too forgot about that
[3:27:12] <Vyneci> Need to buy Crow Within for Umbran Spear to appear
[3:27:14] <%neroforte177> that is clearly a bird
[3:27:14] <%SomeSageAdvice> i remember the switch version of the game crashed on me when i used Crow Within to stop myself from falling to my death
[3:27:17] <%BoxNavy> great
[3:27:18] <OmniSTylez> down b :)
[3:27:23] <+Gorotheninja> Yeah, but Woolie loves it because vergil
[3:27:26] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Umbran Spear lets you quickly dash to an enemy
[3:27:27] <%Dakuu75> which you "now can't do." why?
[3:27:27] <+Joe2187> You click it when you see the rose icon
[3:27:35] <Blank9> bat within's on reaction, dodge is on prediction
[3:27:35] <heartlesshealer> on the rose
[3:27:36] <%dapperdoop> 2 good
[3:27:44] <rytisone> this is essential when playing as Jeanne
[3:27:47] <@SSaryn> It straight up negates damage right?
[3:27:58] <@SSaryn> Ok yeah
[3:27:58] <Blank9> yep, no damage taken
[3:28:06] <greasystreams> Royal GAURD
[3:28:11] <Blank9> and activates a witch time even in climax difficulty
[3:28:12] <OmniSTylez> Pog jun
[3:28:13] <+baldur09> what do the alternate weapons do?
[3:28:14] <+cowkid222> any fun costumes in this one?
[3:28:16] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt easiest way to do bat within and perfect parry is when you see the red rose pop up, thats the frame to push the button
[3:28:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> JUH
[3:28:34] <Blank9> jeanne also does 150% wicked weave damage and takes more damage from attacks, I think?
[3:28:35] <@SSaryn> Oh god yeah Nonstop on Jeanne is probably like.. fucked.
[3:28:36] <huskarl_zap> Jun yung
[3:28:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> JUH
[3:28:45] <greasystreams> A million stones LUL
[3:28:49] <DrkJP520> Bayo has more memorable moments
[3:28:51] <%SirGO0SE> but youre going back to it right now
[3:28:54] <%Grimlockfly> combat improvements, and kicks QTEs to the curb
[3:28:55] <DrkJP520> bayo1
[3:28:55] <MetalDeerS0LID> the cutscenes in 1 are way more fun too
[3:28:56] <grimporio> kinda funny, because the combat changes are the reason some people dont like 2 as much
[3:28:57] <hajekari> 2 is so fluid compared to 1
[3:29:01] <talokur29> @patstaresat if you have Yamato would you use it for power? Or for slicing pizza?
[3:29:02] <LVL1_Scumbag> Gene
[3:29:02] <Ultimatefool> JAN LUL
[3:29:03] <jimmytwofeet> I feel exactly the opposite LUL
[3:29:07] <%BoxNavy> dis gaem
[3:29:12] <greasystreams> wish we could see some of bayo 3 riddlesFeelsTerryMan riddlesFeelsTerryMan riddlesFeelsTerryMan
[3:29:12] <Udongein_1> respectfully disagree
[3:29:15] <+chiazam> A friend of mine played 2 before he played 1, and he fucking hates 1
[3:29:15] <huskarl_zap> Zhen?
[3:29:16] <Blank9> finally, I thought this weapon came WAY earlier
[3:29:17] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[3:29:21] <%baka_sugoi> ew stinky
[3:29:21] <Blank9> it's so much fun with durga
[3:29:22] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Pooper Pat
[3:29:22] <%the22cstomp> i definitely like 2's weapons more than 1's
[3:29:25] <@SSaryn> GO TO THE BAFFROOM
[3:29:30] <+Gorotheninja> Bayo 2's weapons are SOOOOO much better than Bayo 1's
[3:29:32] <fluffyprinceralsei> I wish I didn't hate Bayo 2's combat changes. High level play got really hurt by balancing fights around Umbran Climax
[3:29:33] <+battlebeast67> You say that but a lot of people including myself 2 weaker in combat design to 1.
[3:29:33] <talokur29> EW
[3:29:34] <+Joe2187> Bayo has tons of great combat improvements
[3:29:35] <%templar010> pooped em
[3:29:35] <mycoldshoulder> its pretty strange to see how divisive the games are
[3:29:42] <talokur29> Go use bathroom
[3:29:47] <%juxtest> Bayo 2 is the only reason I still have my WiiU
[3:29:48] <ChungusQuest> Toilet Pat, aka King Butt
[3:29:50] <%Rozalyndis> Rozalyndis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! i miss you and i miss our chats and our dunking on popular opinions. i hope we can do it again soon
[3:29:53] <Blank9> I loved bayo 2's combat, and the weapon balance is great
[3:29:57] <theredfox930000> until it's done
[3:29:59] <talokur29> Load your shit into a turd gun.
[3:30:01] <%BoxNavy> 2 feels better to play
[3:30:02] <BubbaRands> Tiger King meet the Panter Queen!
[3:30:02] <greasystreams> “GO TO THE BATHROOM, YOURE SHITTING YOURSELF”
[3:30:07] <%templar010> Pat shits at bayonetta
[3:30:11] <xanerts> bayo 1 is also really ugly. very brown and grey
[3:30:12] <Blank9> chainsaw + whip was rad
[3:30:16] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I always saw Jean as how you said gary oldmans character in Fifth Element. Also my mother's name is Jean but hers is pronounced like a pair of jeans
[3:30:16] <%WhereIsWill> ight these claws are dope af
[3:30:16] <+Joe2187> @juxtest Bayo 2 is on the switch ya know
[3:30:20] <mycoldshoulder> Umbran climax ruined high level play in 2
[3:30:21] <BubbaRands> he mad
[3:30:22] <Broken_Sonex> @greasystreams No...
[3:30:33] <+battlebeast67> 2 feels worst at higher levels.
[3:30:39] <%juxtest> @Joe2187 I dont have a Switch
[3:30:51] <+Joe2187> sucks to be you
[3:30:51] <%TalisKanju> Yeah the crazy thing about Bayo 2 is how much more colorful it is than the first game
[3:30:57] <%SGrim> Acquire child
[3:30:57] <Udongein_1> bayo 2 made witch time a necessity to play the game and it pretty much ruined it for me
[3:30:58] <mycoldshoulder> Its moslty with enemy design
[3:30:59] <%Grimlockfly> hey dum child
[3:31:00] <%juxtest> lol
[3:31:02] <+Joe2187> sorry that was mean
[3:31:07] <+Joe2187> suck to be Wii u
[3:31:08] <DrkJP520> Cheryl? Is that Cheryl?
[3:31:09] <rytisone> the rocks
[3:31:10] <%FacetiousAF> i'm not sure the switch is worth it for like 3 exclusives
[3:31:14] <%Rozalyndis> i should finish this game...
[3:31:15] <mycoldshoulder> they are design around umbran climax
[3:31:22] <Ultimatefool> God the panther is the best fucking speed up mechanic in any of these character actions
[3:31:23] <greasystreams> Bayo 1 has that DMC2 color palette
[3:31:26] <%FacetiousAF> isn't there a cave with a secret down there?
[3:31:28] <%tank7013> Do the dead flowers have like little faces on them?
[3:31:28] <huskarl_zap> its actually rachel
[3:31:28] <+battlebeast67> @mycoldshoulder nailed it.
[3:31:29] <theredfox930000> man I forgot bayo is ablout high llevel play lol
[3:31:32] <MetalDeerS0LID> witch chest in the rubble in one of the corners
[3:31:34] <+chiazam> Two of em
[3:31:36] <+Gorotheninja> Don't forget Bayo 2 has the best weapon in the series: CHAIN CHOMP!!!
[3:31:39] <talokur29> Meow~
[3:31:42] <%SGrim> Ah yes, the worst enemy
[3:31:43] <%TalisKanju> I'm looking for a little girl. Long, black hair.
[3:31:47] <%wydamn> @FacetiousAF which three? Bayo, Astral Chain, and ...?
[3:31:48] <%Puhff> Y your voice sound different? New mic?
[3:31:48] <+Joe2187> Chain chomp sucks ass
[3:31:50] <mrpandabear437> theres a chest with a disc piece around here somewhere right?
[3:31:52] <Blank9> you have to backtrack here for a secret verse too
[3:31:52] <mycoldshoulder> its still a fantastic game tho
[3:32:07] <%baka_sugoi> DAM AGE psaUp
[3:32:13] <+chiazam> Big Damage, NUMBER GO UP
[3:32:15] <%Grimlockfly> i don't think i realize the claws could do those 'mines'
[3:32:24] <Vcom7418> ORA ORA ORA
[3:32:24] <+battlebeast67> @mycoldshoulder my goty of 2014 was Bayo 2.
[3:32:26] <%SirGO0SE> well Bayo 1 wasnt a Nintendo exclusive, so I wonder how much being Nintendo owned influenced 2
[3:32:30] <+TheBitingIrish> Wonder if 3 will ever be anything other than vaporware
[3:32:30] <huskarl_zap> CBT
[3:32:37] <%baka_sugoi> PogChamp

[3:32:50] <@SSaryn> BUUUUUURB
[3:32:50] <fuji_92> BIRD UP
[3:32:51] <%Rozalyndis> i stopped playing the game because i was such a try hard and had to platinum-clear everything so i'd end up spending an hour on each stage
[3:32:53] <%Puhff> idk im drunk on sake maybe is me
[3:32:53] <mycoldshoulder> @battlebeast67 same here
[3:32:56] <+Joe2187> @SirGO0SE It was being made before SEGA cancelled it, so very little really
[3:33:04] <BubbaRands> I got you blue!
[3:33:05] <s1rcuit> cool bird
[3:33:13] <%SGrim> Also the wings have crystalline pinions

[3:33:27] <rytisone> destroy the rocks for the LP
[3:33:31] <+TheBitingIrish> @SirGO0SE I read an article that said when Devs tried to reign in the sexualization, Nintendo stepped in and told them they didn't have to
[3:33:33] <heartlesshealer> that's pretty cool
[3:33:37] <talokur29> That kiss is powerful
[3:33:39] <%SirGO0SE> @Joe2187 what do you mean? Sega cancelled dev then restarted? sorry im confused
[3:33:39] <%SGrim> Amazing
[3:33:41] <huskarl_zap> the Feather shafts represents dicks
[3:33:41] <jimmytwofeet> NAILED IT
[3:33:53] <%TalisKanju> Man SEGA sucks
[3:33:57] <greasystreams> typical stoner
[3:34:01] <MetalDeerS0LID> odette
[3:34:03] <%SGrim> Acquire vinyl
[3:34:03] <Blank9> that's how you miss an entire weapon your first run
[3:34:05] <%FacetiousAF> @huskarl_zap the dicks symbolize penises
[3:34:05] <Broken_Sonex> Don't you mean "The Dwayne"?
[3:34:07] <Native_Soldier> patineurs hate you
[3:34:10] <+battlebeast67> I always forgot that hidden chest.
[3:34:11] <Blank9> and it's one of the more unique ones
[3:34:16] <Vyneci> Three
[3:34:17] <ChicoMaroto> i didn't expect you streaming bayo SeemsGood
[3:34:18] <%baka_sugoi> bayo 3?
[3:34:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Astral Chain came and went
[3:34:19] <mycoldshoulder> over 3 years, yeah
[3:34:20] <+TheBitingIrish> 2 1/2 I think?
[3:34:21] <%Grimlockfly> and nothing at all
[3:34:22] <%cvp5127> the anti cdpr
[3:34:22] <DianaTheAscian> sure
[3:34:23] <+Joe2187> @SirGO0SE Yes, everything was done for concept, story etc...all they needed was the green light and sega said...nah
[3:34:24] <%RetroCop87> Maybe they were stalling for the Swith Pro
[3:34:24] <Idon__> It was 2017, so it's about to be 4
[3:34:25] <Th3rd3> Pat play on PC?
[3:34:25] <+TheBitingIrish> oh 3 1/2
[3:34:27] <talokur29> Yes
[3:34:28] <BleedinActionMan> Bayo 2 being easier, I think had more to do with Kamiya not being in charge
[3:34:28] <Blank9> astral chain 2 before bayo 3
[3:34:30] <huskarl_zap> @facetiousaf yes
[3:34:31] <greasystreams> Over 3
[3:34:31] <Vyneci> Had its three year anniversary this months
[3:34:32] <%SirGO0SE> @TheBitingIrish thats surprising tbh. kicks ass though :)
[3:34:32] <BubbaRands> And we're WORKING ON IT!
[3:34:34] <pokefan9956> didn't bayonetta 2 take forever as well?
[3:34:35] <%vaporousTippler> Bayonettapunk.
[3:34:35] <FunkyTK> @TheBitingIrish Yeah in fact they showed revisions of designs because they were more conservative and the nintendo guys were like "no no, make it hoter"
[3:34:36] <+Over_ninek> Chances that DMC5 caused them to want to go over it one more time
[3:34:37] <%FacetiousAF> sorry pat we're horny from the bayo
[3:34:38] <+battlebeast67> Yeah I'm actually started to get worried about Bayo 3.
[3:34:38] <Broken_Sonex> What's a Bayo 3?
[3:34:40] <jumpyhugs> needed those switch pro dev kits
[3:34:42] <DrkJP520> 2020 was basically 2 years, so yeah
[3:34:42] <%goatbait> These things take time
[3:34:47] <rytisone> coming when it's done
[3:34:48] <MetalDeerS0LID> Now there's an alpheim if you go back across the water
[3:34:49] <DianaTheAscian> just give us a screen shot at least
[3:34:51] <%OswaldTheDog> can’t rush perfection
[3:34:52] <%dapperdoop> sick traps
[3:34:52] <Idon__> I can't believe SMTV might beat Bayo 3 in the race of vaporware.
[3:34:53] <%M3djedx> M3djedx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Yeaaaa buddy 6 months with my fave goblin
[3:34:53] <%cvp5127> differnet cultures?
[3:34:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Better slow than cyberpunk
[3:34:55] <Udongein_1> longer than the gap between bayo 2 announcement and first actual trailer
[3:34:55] <%RetroCop87> TRICKSTER
[3:34:56] <%N0bdyNoOne> If it doesn't end up like cyberpunk, we fine
[3:34:56] <doggieo> Dont turn Bayo into Cyberpunk
[3:34:58] <%baka_sugoi> Dev hell?
[3:35:00] <Vcom7418> Look, Platinum is at least not CDPRing it and overhyping it. We only had 1 trailer that's in development. I am fine with having the trailer when it's 4-6 months away. Also rocks
[3:35:02] <%coffeebearCafe> that's fine, let them take time. no crunch
[3:35:02] <%M3djedx> psaUp psaUp
[3:35:03] <greasystreams> It’ll be out when it’s out - Sega
[3:35:04] <BubbaRands> BUTTONS
[3:35:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I have plenty of games to play in my backlog, I'm okay with waiting since I figure it'll turn out to be just as great as the first two games
[3:35:07] <Ultimatefool> Hit the bottan

[3:35:17] <%dozind16> dozind16 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! evening Pat me boi! listened to the podcast earlier today and thought you'd be interested in a dope pokemon game called Pokemon Insurgence, if you didn't know of it already. I think it hits most of the boxes of what we want in a new Pokemon game
[3:35:18] <Zayasu> kamiya tweeted earlier this day hes having more trouble with an unannounced project while people worry about bayo 3
[3:35:19] <talokur29> They probably having trouble making it better with a better new combat system.
[3:35:19] <%ShootThatZombie> the rocks
[3:35:20] <mycoldshoulder> I really done think DMC5 had anything to do with it. Platinum is just shit at management
[3:35:20] <fuji_92> you pressed 0 buttons pat
[3:35:21] <%SGrim> In the spears
[3:35:22] <%ElkRiverDog> They’ll admit Eden Ring is fake before Bayo 3 comes out
[3:35:22] <+battlebeast67> Hit the Rocks Pat

[3:35:25] <Zeif00> psaBlind psaBlind
[3:35:26] <+Joe2187> You forget that Metroid prime was announced the same time as Bayo 3
[3:35:29] <BubbaRands> SEE BUTTON?
[3:35:30] <+Gorotheninja> You think Bayo 3 will add a THIRD enemy faction? Like thers angels and demons, but what if there's something in between?
[3:35:31] <Udongein_1> you have to stop the spikes
[3:35:31] <kevamadi> @over_ninek I was thinking the EXACT same thing...
[3:35:39] <cherubs_anonymous> Are you fucking serious
[3:35:39] <%TechnicolorNinja> sipsipSipsipblind
[3:35:41] <+Fabulich> You were so close
[3:35:45] <DrkJP520> rocks by the door
[3:35:47] <fuji_92> huh

[3:36:16] <Vyneci> Go back after this fight for an Alfheim
[3:36:17] <BubbaRands> button
[3:36:19] <@SoFarFetched> pat was thinking abit toooo hard
[3:36:20] <Native_Soldier> at least you're pretty
[3:36:25] <paralars_> There is another backtracking alfheim here i think?
[3:36:26] <greasystreams> Bayonetta 3: Ghost Hunter
[3:36:32] <Broken_Sonex> ......Bayo 3 is gonna suck, calling it now.
[3:36:32] <Fiendmaw> Is he playing on PC?
[3:36:42] <%cvp5127> would they give bayo a nero?
[3:36:42] <Zayasu> @patstaresat really feels like platinum is struggling, not just because of bayo 3
[3:36:45] <paralars_> On switch
[3:36:49] <DrkJP520> Switch
[3:36:50] <greasystreams> Switch @fiendmaw
[3:36:53] <+Joe2187> Platinum has very good management actually, the fact that astral chain was super fast
[3:36:54] <+Over_ninek> i think Pat said the switch version
[3:36:55] <%baka_sugoi> le switch
[3:36:56] <fluffyprinceralsei> Fun tip: if you air dodge out of a Panther Within jump, you boost forward with a stupid amount of momentum
[3:37:00] <MetalDeerS0LID> alpheim across pond
[3:37:06] <BubbaRands> now do switch
[3:37:08] <Vyneci> Go back for an Alfheim
[3:37:16] <mycoldshoulder> Platinum took on like 5 projects at once, is probably why its taking so long
[3:37:18] <+CookieCutter007> where the fuck is Babylon's Fall

[3:37:40] <%juxtest> "Hey get outta my Heim"
[3:37:40] <leinadtonu> ...
[3:37:42] <BubbaRands> That would be cool
[3:37:42] <+Joe2187> While they were doing Astral chain they were also working on that granblue RPG
[3:37:42] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Featuring Alf from the Bayonetta series
[3:37:43] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt people don't know who Alf is nowadays
[3:37:43] <%FacetiousAF> what chance have we mortals against ALF
[3:37:44] <%WhereIsWill> alf, the final dark sin

[3:37:59] <%KineKithZen> When you realize Alf was just '80s Pat
[3:38:01] <huskarl_zap> Alf eating cat represent him being lesbian
[3:38:06] <+Gorotheninja> Father Alf: Lumen Sage
[3:38:07] <dukenux> He couldn't be there, because you can't hurt cats in Platinum's game
[3:38:07] <+Joe2187> arent they also making a Square Enix RPG?
[3:38:08] <%FacetiousAF> bat within is fuckin CLUTCH

[3:38:19] <jimmytwofeet> No you're Pat
[3:38:21] <Broken_Sonex> He's back.........in pog form
[3:38:23] <Zayasu> @vcom7418 is getting booted from the granblue games development part of that LUL
[3:38:27] <leinadtonu> Is eating cats gay?
[3:38:27] <%Alazull> Hell I'm not even samming about these bats
[3:38:33] <%Deft_Thought> Pat was built for Bats
[3:38:34] <+battlebeast67> @mycoldshoulder I only recalled 3. Babylon's Fall, Bayo 3, and the new Hero game by Kamiya.
[3:38:38] <greasystreams> What about Milfheim
[3:38:43] <+Joe2187> staff is best angel weapon with the stripper spin
[3:38:44] <dukenux> Nothing gayer than eating pussy
[3:38:44] <+Over_ninek> VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRM
[3:38:50] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Haha chainsaw go brrr
[3:38:53] <%wydamn> I'm really interested in Project GG
[3:38:53] <ChungusQuest> "You might think I'm pulling your leg, but I'm not, because bats have really tiny legs that are hard to grab"
[3:39:08] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! What is the number one thing, gameplay or story, you want to see in Bayonetta 3?
[3:39:18] <Broken_Sonex> ......What the fuck was Alf supposed to be anyway?
[3:39:29] <%wydamn> @broken_sonex an alien.
[3:39:35] <%baka_sugoi> an alian
[3:39:35] <mycoldshoulder> @battlebeast67 they were also working on Granblue and astral chain when they announced bayo 3, i think
[3:39:38] <huskarl_zap> Alf dies in the end
[3:39:39] <+Joe2187> torture attacks dont count unless they kill
[3:39:40] <%hrbeck_> ALf was an alien, my dude
[3:39:41] <+battlebeast67> You have to kill with torture attacks for them to count.
[3:39:41] <+Greywyn00> did that not count?
[3:39:41] <+CookieCutter007> space ant eater
[3:39:42] <mister_z_1994> An alien who eats cats
[3:39:43] <+Berb64> alien life form
[3:39:44] <leinadtonu> A tiny chewbaka?
[3:39:45] <+Gorotheninja> Alf was a Soap Opera
[3:39:46] <super_robo_mg> Alien Life Form
[3:39:52] <%ForlornCarton> Alien Life Form
[3:39:53] <BubbaRands> A.L.F Alien Life Form
[3:39:54] <KeiPrime> Alien Life Form
[3:39:54] <Moondoggie25> dude ate cats
[3:39:54] <Native_Soldier> from Melmac
[3:39:55] <%wydamn> huskarl_zap Alf doesn't die, he gets taken away by the government.
[3:39:57] <Th3rd3> @wydamn I feels like its gonna be W101, but more serious tone TPFufun
[3:40:00] <DianaTheAscian> alf?
[3:40:01] <Broken_Sonex> Never saw the show, so
[3:40:01] <+TheBitingIrish> Fuzzy bastard ate my cat :(
[3:40:09] <%Grimlockfly> get good at recognizing 90s puppet aliens
[3:40:10] <ChungusQuest> He only wishes he died
[3:40:13] <huskarl_zap> @wydamn damn thats worse
[3:40:31] <Oath_Othelio> lol it didn't count
[3:40:36] <+Joe2187> pat failed the alfheim
[3:40:38] <dukenux> He gets taken away by the gov, locked in Area 51 and eventually disected
[3:40:39] <+battlebeast67> @mycoldshoulder oh forgot about that.
[3:40:42] <%VoidBaronJules> did Alf and Mork ever meet?
[3:40:43] <dukenux> look it up, it's canon
[3:40:44] <Native_Soldier> Alf got the sad ending
[3:40:48] <+icekept> didn't count
[3:40:54] <leinadtonu> Poor Alf trapped under all that bureocracy
[3:41:01] <+Joe2187> @PatStaresAt The torture attacks dont count unless they kill
[3:41:03] <%baka_sugoi> why can't there be more games like these?
[3:41:06] <%wydamn> huskarl_zap, it was pretty brutal. I think it was supposed to be a semi-cliff hanger thing to encourage a fan outcry for some resolution, but then the show just never got renewed.
[3:41:19] <A_CD_By_Thomas> fuck
[3:41:20] <+TheBitingIrish> Lame
[3:41:21] <+Greywyn00> LUL
[3:41:22] <%SGrim> Oof
[3:41:23] <%baka_sugoi> womp womp
[3:41:25] <+Gorotheninja> Alf would eat Trish, Claire, Silvia, and Ammy
[3:41:26] <ChungusQuest> Yeah, that felt like a writers' room protest
[3:41:27] <$arran_throttle> damn it pat
[3:41:29] <dan_g_v> mortis
[3:41:30] <huskarl_zap> @wydamn damn
[3:41:31] <fuji_92> welp
[3:41:32] <%RealThiele> USE
[3:41:43] <%Grimlockfly> I love how Alf was cancelled on a cliffhanger, and was wrapped up in a TV movie long after anyone gave a shit. Party500
[3:41:45] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[3:41:45] <%baka_sugoi> don't get bonked
[3:41:49] <huskarl_zap> Not enough SNUFF for this game
[3:41:49] <grimporio> doesnt taunting give you magic?
[3:41:53] <mister_z_1994> And don't wail on the same guy for too long
[3:41:54] <rytisone> taunt until it's done
[3:41:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Really, that's just Alfheims in general
[3:42:04] <+razielhex> aaaand there's Rank 40.
[3:42:11] <Bladethrine> And just taunt.
[3:42:11] <Udongein_1> taunting can help you gain magic
[3:42:19] <BleedinActionMan> Didn't the rest of the cast absolutely hate Alf?
[3:42:23] <+Over_ninek> how are the diminishing returns on the taunt though
[3:42:35] <%FacetiousAF> god fuckin damn i love bat within
[3:42:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Remember when DMC5 did the "don't touch the ground" challenge a decade after this game but made you reload the whole stage when you messed up instead of just resetting the clock?
[3:42:40] <%hrbeck_> why does persona5's mom got a dump truck ass?
[3:42:44] <%baka_sugoi> just gonna FLEX on'em
[3:42:48] <tubit> Alf is pretty insufferable. A lot like the alien in American Dad
[3:42:48] <Udongein_1> triggering witch time and perfect parrying I believe also gives you magic
[3:42:50] <Laecerelius> Damn
[3:42:53] <%arcielardor> I hope Bayo 3 has different taunt levels like DMC5
[3:42:54] <%SGrim> Obliterated

[3:46:29] <tanarath> Pat and Paige are going to hold hands
[3:46:34] <%FacetiousAF> chat do you like bat within? your options are yes and fuck yes
[3:46:40] <@SoFarFetched> "paiiigee,I need you to wake up to change my diaper cause you do it better than I do"
[3:46:41] <%wydamn> I actually didn't understand how to play Bayonetta properly in smash brothers until I realized they incoporated the button-holding gunshots into her normal attacks, which is different than almost every other smash character.
[3:47:20] <%RealThiele> paige need frothy diaper mustard
[3:47:27] <@SoFarFetched> oh no
[3:47:35] <@SoFarFetched> geefNLT
[3:47:47] <%XzileGaming> there's something bad about "frothy diaper mustard" that i dont like
[3:47:48] <Broken_Sonex> Who's ass is fatter. Bayo's or Jerma's?
[3:48:10] <%SirGO0SE> JermaDumptruck1 JermaDumptruck2
[3:48:18] <%thedankestmeeme> psaGiefrail
[3:48:28] <%wydamn> RealThiele if you just said diaper mustard it would have been fine. But you had to say "frothy" diaper mustard. DansGame
[3:48:45] <%RealThiele> you are welcome
[3:48:51] <@SoFarFetched> 1 step forward,20 steps back
[3:48:56] <+icekept> LUL
[3:49:22] <+battlebeast67> @wydamn honestly I didn't like how they incorporated Bayo into Smash. She doesn't function like she does in her own game. Missing several vital mechanics to make her perform well.
[3:49:26] <Broken_Sonex> You gotta make if frothy. It's makes you flinch.
[3:50:24] <+battlebeast67> But then again Smash doesn't allow characters to have a lot of depth in the game.
[3:50:34] <+Gorotheninja> Pat am become dead
[3:50:43] <%wydamn> @battlebeast67 yeah it's definitely not perfect, but I think they found a decent middle ground. Although I'm a filthy Ike main so maybe my opinion doesn't matter.
[3:50:43] <%FacetiousAF> welcome back big pogchamp
[3:50:45] <@SoFarFetched> and with a fresh new diaper

[3:52:26] <huskarl_zap> We now make the motion to move on to guro.
[3:52:29] <BubbaRands> Should I google what "Crinkling" is?
[3:52:34] <@SSaryn> @huskarl_zap Nope.
[3:52:34] <ChungusQuest> lol get Streisand'd

[3:52:49] <huskarl_zap> how about ganguro?
[3:52:51] <leinadtonu> Oh, so Pat's a crinkly boy eh?
[3:52:58] <+battlebeast67> @wydamn No, I totally get where you're coming from. Enjoy her. Just from a fan's perspective, I don't think she didn't translate too well to Smash.
[3:52:59] <Broken_Sonex> Pat is just ashamed of his secret crinkle fetish
[3:53:01] <+icekept> use urban dictionary
[3:53:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Is that the Barney "Ow"?
[3:53:13] <bettysharkface> Why has Pat turned into Bubbles?
[3:53:14] <%baka_sugoi> BONK
[3:53:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @EynosStyles Tis a game series that's fun to play with other people and has probably been at the center of a lot of nostalgic memories. Then it gets recommended to new people the the whole thing just spirals in popularity
[3:53:17] <Laecerelius> Damn

[3:53:38] <EynosStyles> this make me miss play Bayonetta.
[3:53:38] <+battlebeast67> A small tip, don't taunt anymore after the first wave, they get more unpredictable if enraged.
[3:53:53] <%XzileGaming> no, that was his morty impression

[3:58:37] <%wydamn> it's not the same as getting greedy in Dark Souls. In Dark Souls, it's the greed to get one more hit in. In this, it's the greed to not drop your combo.

[4:00:01] <%Mrbaconator> honestly that's fine ^

[4:16:24] <%BoxNavy> god dammit, god
[4:16:26] <+Over_ninek> god i wish Bayo had those awful live action cut scenes from DMC5
[4:16:28] <%FacetiousAF> at least in 2 the whole thing is an escort mission Kappa
[4:16:28] <ScreamLord> Becuse God is cruel
[4:16:29] <%walternatorz> god has forsaken you
[4:16:30] <Resderp> I HATED this mission
[4:16:32] <+Greywyn00> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[4:16:35] <+cthulewd> I don't understand Bayo's powerset sometimes, like does she just make portals or does she also have some FullMetal Alchemist type abilities?
[4:16:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> God's an asshole, that's why you're beating up angels
[4:16:35] <amonimis> damn you god

[4:16:40] <%baka_sugoi> Sp00ky sexy Gh00st
[4:16:47] <%wydamn> as far as escort missions go in games, this one's not really that bad.
[4:16:47] <+Gorotheninja> Defend Ashley while she turns the crank
[4:16:53] <Blank9> fire mines do so much damage
[4:16:58] <%wydamn> It's probably only really bad in NSIC
[4:17:16] <ScreamLord> Even the Bible will tell you how much of a raging douchebag shitlord God is
[4:17:21] <boardscanada> BTW it's amazing how despite all the hype for years Cyberpunk just came and went - down to 10K views on Twitch in less than 2 weeks

[4:17:39] <californaya> @sakeydo ooh, I wonder if those heart rate things for your fingers work on your dick
[4:17:41] <%bevyrage> the only escort mission in this game i'm not a fan of is the one where you have to throw environmental hazards around
[4:17:43] <BubbaRands> Like the pole dance you should've been?
[4:17:46] <%radda343> this fly me to the moon cover is dope
[4:17:48] <%SirGO0SE> @cthulewd +2

[4:44:11] <%Agami23> yeah thats why i love them
[4:44:15] <%AXL808> farming this boss was annoying
[4:44:15] <Daxalog> God this is way better than the DMC4 boss fight like this
[4:44:16] <%RetroCop87> Pat eating all of the shit
[4:44:18] <%Monkeyweed21> wow pat sux
[4:44:22] <%Agami23> they look fucking freaky as shit its cool
[4:44:30] <DianaTheAscian> Pats gonna lose
[4:44:33] <DejaraUndead> he has literal finger guns
[4:44:34] <s1rcuit> ol' Johnny Two Hands
[4:44:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Edward Gunhands
[4:44:46] <marvel877> and then this became an early boss fight type in W101.
[4:44:50] <jchmxlupus> We in this good game now bois
[4:44:58] <xanerts> wait this is just SAVIOR
[4:45:05] <rytisone> smash good
[4:45:06] <%wydamn> His fingers are basically the JK 47 from Enter The Gungeon. They're guns with weird floppy barrels.
[4:45:06] <DMatts142> are u supposed to be airborne for that?
[4:45:08] <huskarl_zap> Jeany two toes
[4:45:08] <ahandsomegentleman> it reminds me of the L'cie or whatever they're called from FFXIII
[4:45:12] <richard_madden95> @a_cd_by_thomas I prefer Serpentia than Temperantia tbh. Just feels more badass fighting in the middle of the ocean. Plus, Serpentia track is dope af. DarkMode
[4:45:13] <+chiazam> @xanerts It always was
[4:45:14] <%logoth_> Why do angels have gun hands
[4:45:21] <marvel877> Do good timing.
[4:45:22] <jchmxlupus> @xanerts Super Fast Savior
[4:45:24] <%AXL808> you're supposed to jump to another platform
[4:45:37] <BubbaRands> @logoth_ Why Not?
[4:45:38] <auraofdawn> this is like the savior except interesting and fun
[4:45:38] <+Gorotheninja> Every Bayonetta boss is a setpiece boss
[4:45:47] <heartlesshealer> jump into debris
[4:45:51] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @richard_madden95 Serpentia's definitely up there for me too, as is his track
[4:45:52] <rytisone> He's Cyber Angel
[4:46:00] <%BoxNavy> yes :)
[4:46:01] <ahandsomegentleman> no one told me there'd be platforming :/
[4:46:04] <%logoth_> You're fine just dont get hit EVER AGAIN
[4:46:06] <%FacetiousAF> OORRRRRAAAA
[4:46:15] <s1rcuit> this is Shadow of the Colossus now
[4:46:16] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Rip 'em off
[4:46:17] <+epoladia> Is the taunt to gain HP in this game or only 2?
[4:46:25] <%baka_sugoi> SEPAROTH
[4:46:36] <DrkJP520> sick
[4:46:52] <ahandsomegentleman> * faux latin chanting *
[4:47:04] <%thedankestmeeme> SEVENROTH
[4:47:07] <BleedinActionMan> @epoladia I think it's in this one
[4:47:22] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I hate ghost fuck KappaPride
[4:47:29] <jotabranded> is this on hard?
[4:47:42] <%BoxNavy> pat has died
[4:47:42] <marvel877> normal
[4:47:44] <%AzureGale> Pat ded
[4:47:45] <%BoxNavy> in real life even
[4:47:46] <Laecerelius> Ooops, all dead!
[4:47:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The shadow remains cast
[4:47:47] <%sighphers> f
[4:47:48] <%RetroCop87> good night sweet potato
[4:47:49] <%FuzzTime> Pat Died
[4:47:49] <%YakumoYomi> YOU DEAD
[4:47:52] <%bevyrage> this is not a good boss fight to have to knock off rust to either
[4:47:54] <penitentpendant> Pat died on his way to his home Cube
[4:47:54] <s1rcuit> MORTIS
[4:47:57] <%baka_sugoi> PAT loses
[4:47:57] <huskarl_zap> Pat ricide
[4:47:57] <%logoth_> Work the shaft
[4:47:58] <SchroedingersFerret> Rest in Pat
[4:48:02] <pilllowofbees> @epoladia its here as a accessory
[4:48:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat... DIE
[4:48:11] <dukenux> Pat died on a way to his home planet
[4:48:21] <richard_madden95> @a_cd_by_thomas But i'll never have the same epic experience as my first time fighting Jubileus. They really made that boss worked af! Damn, miss that kind of experience. Wish we'll get that experience in Bayo 3. High hope PogChamp DarkMode Kreygasm
[4:48:21] <%BoxNavy> yes
[4:48:33] <heartlesshealer> if you jump without prompt it's just a normal jump
[4:49:05] <heartlesshealer> so it's extra annoying if you press too earlier as opposed to the wrong place
[4:49:09] <dukenux> Patrick Fuccboivin RIP. Gone but not forgotten
[4:49:11] <heartlesshealer> too early*
[4:49:13] <%AncelDeLambert> amazing how much faster this fight goes with the auto-witch-time amulet
[4:49:18] <ahandsomegentleman> bayonetta only understands jumping contextually
[4:49:22] <%wibbwobbler> reminds me of dmc4
[4:49:42] <+zeraux_> so at the end of the day how does bayo 2 stack up against bayo
[4:49:52] <Daxalog> I think it damages it self when you jump?
[4:49:54] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt I think the jump is just to avoid that attack
[4:50:00] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt if you build for gun, then the other platform is more useful.
[4:50:01] <%AncelDeLambert> just not doing enough damage, my man
[4:50:01] <tubit> I get the feeling that Square and Platinum have been kinda bouncing off each other in terms of boss design
[4:50:07] <pilllowofbees> @zeraux_ very stacked
[4:50:17] <BleedinActionMan> @zeraux_ It has a lot less bullshit, in my opinion
[4:50:20] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @richard_madden95 Oh yeah, I'm defintely hoping for something epic in 3. I suspect it'll be a pretty great finale to the trilogy, assuming this is the last game in the series (or just in a current saga)
[4:50:22] <huskarl_zap> People waiting for Chess2 > people waiting for bayo 3
[4:50:44] <Scarednimbus> Hold and then rapid mash is crazy good with the skates
[4:50:45] <huskarl_zap> dick gun fingers
[4:50:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @zeraux_ I think Bayo 2 is far better, but it's a contentious point from what I hear and both games are pretty great
[4:50:48] <%BoxNavy> chess 2 had its chance
[4:50:55] <%FacetiousAF> heckin tonkaries
[4:50:56] <Vyneci> Hekatoncheir
[4:50:57] <ahandsomegentleman> i want an El Shaddai 2
[4:50:58] <heartlesshealer> yes
[4:50:59] <%Monkeyweed21> hecatoncheires
[4:51:02] <%AncelDeLambert> heyyyy, he finally got to the next segment
[4:51:05] <%baka_sugoi> nice arm bro
[4:51:07] <DrkJP520> Yeah, fuck your rings!
[4:51:14] <%luftraumm1> grandpas of the titans in greek myth
[4:51:15] <%tinyswampthing> chess 2 exists it was made by david ssirlin
[4:51:20] <Mattais88> It's the smith giants from greek myth
[4:51:32] <ElisabetSobeck> @ElisabetSobeck is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[4:51:34] <dukenux> Heavenly Halitosis
[4:51:36] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @ahandsomegentleman I'd adore seeing El Shaddai come back, super fun world
[4:51:36] <s1rcuit> so far these boss fights are proving to me that the demons are way stronger than the angels
[4:51:38] <Mattais88> thousand arms and such
[4:51:39] <huskarl_zap> I think its zeus aborted son made into a weapon?
[4:51:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Heck-A-Tonn-Kere
[4:51:45] <xanerts> isnt it 1000 arms
[4:51:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nah, 100
[4:52:04] <SomeAsianDood> heka=100
[4:52:05] <%FacetiousAF> yeah heckin chonky meats
[4:52:05] <%luftraumm1> nope 1000 armed sons of chaos
[4:52:15] <jackeroff3> is this pat's first time playing bayo?
[4:52:22] <SomeAsianDood> Argus is probably the most famous one
[4:52:29] <s1rcuit> pretty sure they had 100 arms and 50 heads
[4:52:30] <jackeroff3> I didn't want to spoil anything
[4:52:40] <%logoth_> Yay FFX music
[4:52:43] <+zeraux_> im surprised its not the pc version tbh
[4:53:09] <+zeraux_> fair\
[4:53:10] <%Agami23> i dunno pat. you tend to make these games look real easy.
[4:53:13] <DMatts142> Switch version is the defacto version bc the nintendo upgrades, right?
[4:53:13] <%RetroCop87> Bayo 2 was console only?
[4:53:14] <%FacetiousAF> yeah this is the wiiu version Kappa
[4:53:20] <heartlesshealer> so might as well get used to console play
[4:53:21] <%baka_sugoi> data transfer to bayo 2
[4:53:33] <%wydamn> retrocop87 Bayo 2 was and is Nintendo only
[4:53:35] <lovesosa236> the ps4 has costumes that the switch doesn't have from the ps3 version
[4:53:37] <%FacetiousAF> what's in his mouth Kappa
[4:53:38] <DrkJP520> You don't even get the peach and link costumes on PC. Worthless
[4:53:43] <%baka_sugoi> PUNH IT
[4:53:44] <DianaTheAscian> ew
[4:53:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @RetroCop87 Bayo 2 was actually published by Nintendo, originally released on Wii U
[4:53:47] <+Over_ninek> look at that Khezu head
[4:53:51] <pilllowofbees> @RetroCop87 yeah nintendo exclusive
[4:53:56] <+RahuHordika> I wonder if Woolie and Reggie did Bayo 2
[4:54:00] <%SirGO0SE> uh oh vore
[4:54:05] <BubbaRands> Bayo is part of Nintendo now unfortunately...
[4:54:06] <s1rcuit> could it be that the Stone ranking is so low because all the angels have gross stone faces?
[4:54:12] <+KiwiRedgrave> i bet you theres so much Bayo vore porn
[4:54:13] <+zeraux_> ive been working on beatiing nioh for like 4 years yoll
[4:54:17] <lovesosa236> yeah but the switch doesn't get the costumes from the ps3 version. and most is just Nintendo costumes
[4:54:20] <huskarl_zap> Bayonetta ip is now owned by valve and will never release
[4:54:21] <%sighphers> uh oh
[4:54:29] <ahandsomegentleman> @a_cd_by_thomas yea, i didn't even know the story wqs bwsed on the Book of Enoch at first
[4:54:41] <%baka_sugoi> ded

[4:54:52] <DianaTheAscian> fuck
[4:54:55] <%Spydurman> yeyeye
[4:54:57] <%bevyrage> at least it's not the whole boss fight over again
[4:54:59] <DMatts142> I hate how sometimes dodging w/ good timing DOESNT do witch time
[4:54:59] <butchi1025> His breathe is worm on a string
[4:55:00] <richard_madden95> @a_cd_by_thomas I'm hoping they put everything in Bayo 3. Like go all out on Bayo 3. Make it over the top af & have it as a great conclusion to Bayo franchise. I really want them to explore the Bayo demons a lot more & playable Balder please! I want Bayo 3 to be as grand as action game can be DarkMode Kreygasm
[4:55:03] <%TalisKanju> TalisKanju subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Two streams of two great games on my birthday, nice
[4:55:04] <DMatts142> like its context ependent
[4:55:06] <pilllowofbees> @BubbaRands dont say unfortunately they were the only ones to fund it LUL
[4:55:07] <DrkJP520> thank goodness, i was afraid you'd have to restart the whole thing
[4:55:08] <%wibbwobbler> checkpointed
[4:55:11] <%BoxNavy> DansGame
[4:55:11] <%Dementedpenguin> I remember the game in general, but I forget a lot of the "smaller" details.
[4:55:13] <%FacetiousAF> schnasty
[4:55:14] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah, this one is extremely what I was thinking of when I said "demons with pretty armor"
[4:55:15] <%BoxNavy> oh i remember this
[4:55:18] <huskarl_zap> hot
[4:55:19] <lovesosa236> bayo 3 isn't real
[4:55:22] <%Dementedpenguin> Haven't played this in 10 years
[4:55:24] <%BoxNavy> this guys fuckin gross kill him
[4:55:30] <Profmcstevie> Honestly thanks to the witch time mechanic I could just mash and dodge when necessary, so I forget most boss fights LUL
[4:55:36] <Ranryu692> I don't even remember this boss
[4:55:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh man, I don't think I've ever been grabbed by that awful, awful tongue
[4:55:39] <%baka_sugoi> STINKY
[4:55:45] <Mattais88> Just remember the five D's of Bayonetta, Dodge, Dip, Duck, Dive and Dodge.
[4:55:45] <huskarl_zap> Our new tag disscusion is tenticle pit now
[4:55:46] <DrkJP520> Weird ass creepy worm head
[4:55:56] <%wydamn> @bubbarands yeah, pilllowofbees is right, if not for Nintendo there would be no Bayo 2.
[4:56:08] <marvel877> I really don't know where the checkpoints are because everytime I died I'd just restart the whole level over because I don't want to see a continue on my chapter score screen.
[4:56:17] <%baka_sugoi> LETS GOOO

[4:59:12] <DMatts142> wait! next level is the After Burner level, right?! PogChamp
[4:59:12] <+LowBatteryLife> bayo makes precisely enough time for penis as she means to.
[4:59:12] <%bevyrage> this means you gotta do it all over again right
[4:59:13] <richard_madden95> @wydamn If Bayo 2 was funded by Square instead, how do you think it would've been play out instead Kappa
[4:59:14] <%Monkeyweed21> The question we need to be asking is "What fetish ISN'T Bayonetta into?"
[4:59:15] <ChungusQuest> You can tell she's evil because her clothes are loose
[4:59:15] <jimmytwofeet> DAWWWWW
[4:59:20] <heartlesshealer> orb get orb rank

[4:59:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good job
[4:59:38] <MetalDeerS0LID> Bayonetta Isn't into crinkling or bugchansing
[4:59:39] <Laecerelius> You must now have Ryker kill you with a knife to recover from this dishonor, Pat.
[4:59:41] <%FacetiousAF> psaGib sleep time for me
[4:59:44] <%FacetiousAF> chat you play nice
[4:59:45] <heartlesshealer> but yeah good job on boss

[4:59:55] <BleedinActionMan> Oh, time for best level Kappa

[5:00:05] <BleedinActionMan> awwww
[5:00:05] <Profmcstevie> Drift city
[5:00:06] <DejaraUndead> at this point I think pat is trying to get stone on purpose at this point
[5:00:09] <%wydamn> @ChungusQuest the guns themselves are usually phallic symbols, but Bayo's body language and attitude usually has her waving them around like a couple of toys, so i guess that's on brand too
[5:00:10] <DMatts142> awwww lol
[5:00:10] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Sounds good
[5:00:12] <%BoxNavy> aw yeah

[5:00:53] <%wydamn> @richard_madden95 really got no clue how Square would do it, they'd probaby wouldn't be as hands off as Nintendo was.
[5:00:55] <afronooch> the real question is if Bayonetta had fun with us

[5:15:08] <%Jekado> great now all of "pats mind goblins" knows its fucked.
[5:15:16] <dukenux> prolly the subreddit knows
[5:15:18] <%VoidBaronJules> carrion, a bunch of rogue likes, ff7r
[5:15:18] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt and depending on how annoying the auto add terms are you might have to make new playlists
[5:15:21] <Railgun5> Just use Twitch Tracker or something
[5:15:22] <Broken_Sonex> If you can't remember it was probably stupid Kappa
[5:15:29] <dukenux> Yeah, you streamed Supergiant games
[5:15:47] <heartlesshealer> You streamed Deadly Premonition 2
[5:15:52] <%VoidBaronJules> yeah an excel or google doc might be a good reference point
[5:15:53] <%bevyrage> ooooooh that's super fucked
[5:16:14] <@SoFarFetched> yeah remember OLD FF7
[5:16:16] <heartlesshealer> RETURN OF THE OBRA DINN
[5:16:21] <%walternatorz> You did 1/2 FFVII
[5:16:22] <%SirGO0SE> @heartlesshealer thats a big contender
[5:16:25] <+Carquar> Was Outer Wilds this year?
[5:16:36] <dukenux> capture that
[5:16:39] <%bevyrage> outer wilds and outer worlds were last year iirc
[5:16:45] <dukenux> sleepy Pat of frustration
[5:16:45] <@SSaryn> It did.
[5:16:46] <%Dementedpenguin> Yes.
[5:16:46] <%Ranryu692> @Carquar that was last year
[5:16:47] <rytisone> and Doomz
[5:16:48] <@SSaryn> Start of this year.
[5:16:48] <%Emperor_Machinus> I though FF7 RE was two years ago
[5:16:48] <%VoidBaronJules> march yeah
[5:16:49] <heartlesshealer> yes
[5:16:49] <%Zeikier> I can't believe this is still the year FF7R came out
[5:16:49] <%bevyrage> ff7 was this year yes
[5:16:50] <NitronStreams> it did
[5:16:51] <%WhereIsWill> just hire plague to fix all of it
[5:16:52] <%YakumoYomi> The wonders of Youtube embracing more automation!
[5:16:53] <s1rcuit> some of it did
[5:16:53] <%Ranryu692> Remake was this year
[5:16:55] <heartlesshealer> it was fucking this year
[5:16:56] <%cvp5127> NotLikeThis
[5:16:56] <TheBlankAce> Pat it was April
[5:16:58] <@SoFarFetched> yeah FF7R was this year
[5:17:01] <dukenux> Doom Eternal, right?
[5:17:01] <BubbaRands> YES
[5:17:03] <@SoFarFetched> and TLOU2 was this year
[5:17:03] <@SSaryn> That's fine, Covid fucked us all.
[5:17:05] <bettysharkface> Debatably, better things than FF7R happened
[5:17:05] <%YakumoYomi> FF7R was in April
[5:17:05] <DrkJP520> apparently ff7 part 2 development is going smoothly
[5:17:07] <%bevyrage> FF7 was in the game awards remember
[5:17:07] <%Aeoneth> FF7R came out tat the start of poandemic
[5:17:08] <ChungusQuest> What really is a year, anyway?
[5:17:08] <%ssjklyco> just before cyberpunk
[5:17:08] <+Carquar> Yeah, remember you were stressed because Cyberpunk was supposed to come out around the same time
[5:17:19] <%wibbwobbler> 2020 totally happened i swear
[5:17:22] <heartlesshealer> "8 months ago" for FF7R FINALE
[5:17:24] <rytisone> It's 1997 right?
[5:17:25] <%Jekado> i don't even remeber is pat played Bayo this year!!!
[5:17:27] <NitronStreams> This year was like 10 years long
[5:17:34] <jimmytwofeet> GET SOME SLEEP BRO
[5:17:34] <%ssjklyco> Playlist 2020
[5:17:35] <%SGrim> Yes
[5:17:42] <BubbaRands> What decade is this?
[5:17:46] <tubit> Yes
[5:17:47] <%Zeikier> youtube keeps doing this thing where I can't like or subscribe to anything or comment, cuz desktop website upkeep is hard I guess
[5:18:00] <+Lionrebellion> you streamed RE3-6. I know that.
[5:18:01] <%SGrim> ff7 was in March
[5:18:06] <%SGrim> 9 months ago
[5:18:08] <DrkJP520> that's the spirit
[5:18:09] <%AzureGale> Jesus came
[5:18:09] <%RetroCop87> Nooo, but my comic book looorrrreee
[5:18:09] <dukenux> which Constantine
[5:18:13] <%Zeikier> LITRE OF COLA!?
[5:18:22] <%VashyronM> the good one
[5:18:24] <%Dementedpenguin> Oh fuck I remember the RE6 stream and that FUCKING snow level
[5:18:28] <+JustToWatch> that's right Pat, Rome never existed
[5:18:32] <%Zeikier> some-vous fuckin' lips about to be broke :V
[5:18:34] <%moondog_> 40 OF CRACK
[5:18:37] <%juxtest> The Countdown Vampires video came out on Machinima this year, right
[5:18:40] <%TalisKanju> Nope, still here son
[5:18:41] <%wibbwobbler> kamiya wept
[5:18:54] <dukenux> It's cause Bayo's nintendo IP
[5:19:04] <%VoidBaronJules> what about Okami though
[5:19:07] <%Zeikier> Dante would be a more interesting Shulk
[5:19:24] <%Emperor_Machinus> By making him so broken
[5:19:26] <DianaTheAscian> u can't
[5:19:27] <$Afterman_> each costume with dante has a different weapon
[5:19:30] <%Zeikier> I mean Mega Man got all his powers in as tilts and neutral As
[5:19:30] <%Ranryu692> that's why it's gotta be Nero instead
[5:19:32] <rytisone> leave him with revelion and pistols
[5:19:33] <DrkJP520> Just give him nevan
[5:19:34] <+Skaphel> Howd they put in Terry ?
[5:19:34] <%AzureGale> They made him work in Marvel vs. Capcom 3
[5:19:35] <%Agami23> give nero
[5:19:37] <DianaTheAscian> they can't do it
[5:19:37] <Profmcstevie> He's gotten even MORE weapons since Marvel 3, where he had THE MANY MOVES
[5:19:42] <NitronStreams> How do you do DT justice?
[5:19:44] <dukenux> fuck balance. wacky woohoo pizza op
[5:19:47] <%Grimlockfly> And Dante is kind of capcom high tier
[5:19:47] <%ssjklyco> He has 4 echoes
[5:19:49] <marvel877> You make him about as busted as Steve or Hero.
[5:19:51] <%WhereIsWill> just bust a Hero, and make down B a stance change, or weapon change
[5:19:51] <%bevyrage> what you mean like bayonetta and byleth?
[5:19:51] <dukenux> make him broken and fun
[5:19:51] <%moondog_> make 3 shadow variants of dante
[5:19:53] <+jiggy_snipe> each attack would be a different thing from his moveset
[5:19:54] <%Zeikier> plus Zelda and Shiek used to exist as one character
[5:19:58] <%moondog_> or echoes
[5:20:04] <tubit> true
[5:20:12] <%Zeikier> Dr. Orpheus
[5:20:18] <+Over_ninek> i need to replay Bloodstained with all the new content
[5:20:21] <%SGrim> An echo of each style PogChamp
[5:20:23] <dukenux> The actual Bram Stoker's Dracula
[5:20:24] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[5:20:26] <%Zeikier> and he looked like Mitch Hedburg
[5:20:27] <%AzureGale> YES
[5:20:32] <%ssjklyco> Just make it so taht when you select Dante, you can select Sword, Trick, Royal and Gun dante
[5:20:35] <heartlesshealer> I remember Dr. Acula
[5:20:36] <%crimsonharvest> That's an extremely Kris Straub style joke aka the best
[5:20:37] <%AzureGale> Dr. Acula GOGOOGOOOOOOOOOOO
[5:20:40] <TheBlankAce> There is a boss fight in that game against Iga who just does Dracula's moves
[5:20:40] <%Zeikier> Bram Stroker and Hoop
[5:20:49] <DrkJP520> Did Dr. Acula originate in Scrubs?
[5:20:49] <marvel877> I miss Mitch Hedberg.
[5:20:51] <%Zeikier> Bram Stokegera
[5:20:56] <pancake_madness> The doctor is IN *shoots fireball*
[5:20:59] <$Afterman_> dracule is close enough
[5:21:00] <%wibbwobbler> next time
[5:21:03] <%juxtest> Reyals
[5:21:07] <heartlesshealer> oh god insurgence
[5:21:10] <%Zeikier> OH, I think that's one of the good ones yeah
[5:21:12] <heartlesshealer> uhhhh
[5:21:17] <pokefan9956> played a bit of pokemon insurgence. it's fucking rad
[5:21:17] <%Zeikier> Pokemon Sage is also kinda fun
[5:21:18] <%Agami23> look up delta venasaur
[5:21:20] <s1rcuit> Nintendo's ears perk up
[5:21:23] <heartlesshealer> no it's the other one
[5:21:26] <dukenux> what kind of subtitle is that
[5:21:31] <%Emperor_Machinus> a grenade to your voltorb
[5:21:34] <dukenux> Pokemodern Warfare
[5:21:36] <%Zeikier> insurgence iirc is edgy but like, aware that it's edgy and has fun with it
[5:21:39] <+Skaphel> he wasnt kidding, that dog can score
[5:21:45] <heartlesshealer> it's the "new types" one
[5:21:47] <jimmytwofeet> POKEY MAN
[5:21:47] <%ssjklyco> Wait, you have Dantes Taunts change his style in smash.
[5:21:52] <Slim_Filthy> As if we wouldn't play an unnecessarily hyper realistic pokemon game
[5:21:52] <heartlesshealer> okay but yes
[5:21:57] <pilllowofbees> FUCK
[5:21:58] <%Dementedpenguin> So you wanna date the pokemon
[5:22:00] <@SSaryn> Monster Hunter Stories is as far as you're getting for a good Pokemon game.
[5:22:01] <+griffball13> it's called digimon cyber slueth
[5:22:02] <%NopeBadguy> i just want another shadow pokemon game
[5:22:03] <%Dementedpenguin> Oh
[5:22:06] <%walternatorz> poor dittos
[5:22:07] <%NopeBadguy> i miss colo and xd
[5:22:07] <%Agami23> i want a pokemon game that looks like digimon cyber sleuth at least
[5:22:10] <%weissguard> Go to sleep, jesus christ. LUL
[5:22:10] <%SirGO0SE> Reshiram Kreygasm
[5:22:10] <s1rcuit> Imagine a pokemon game like that pokemon noir comic
[5:22:12] <%juxtest> Hey that Experiment whatever Pokemon from Sun/Moon had an axe strapped to its head.
[5:22:12] <%ZephynM> Persona 5 Royal is awesome. I look forward to P5 Strikers on Steam February
[5:22:13] <marvel877> I'd want a Pokemon game made by the Xenoblade devs.
[5:22:13] <%wibbwobbler> botw
[5:22:14] <pancake_madness> Isn't Monster Hunter just pokemon hunting?
[5:22:15] <%Piemen99> that'll be that.....ok not that part
[5:22:15] <heartlesshealer> they die together to birth a new demon from their mixed blood
[5:22:15] <thesanderdc> that's every pokemon game
[5:22:16] <%coffeebearCafe> it's better pokemon
[5:22:19] <%bevyrage> he's talking about the demons
[5:22:24] <%Ranryu692> Yeah, let the Cyber Sleuth people make a pokemon game
[5:22:30] <%YakumoYomi> Pokemon Sword and Shield sold an assload of copies. They have ZERO incentive to do any more than that
[5:22:31] <%zeroarturia> Digimon cyber sleuth is waaaaaayyy better than the current pokemon games
[5:22:35] <heartlesshealer> Dragon Quest Monsters tho!
[5:22:38] <%Zeikier> this one has pat, I'm pat
[5:22:40] <Anserian> HE SNORE
[5:22:59] <%cvp5127> i just a pkmn with dq8 world
[5:23:02] <%zeroarturia> @yakumoyomi and thats the problem too.
[5:23:03] <+Ether101_Prime> They also made some of the weapon option better with 11.
[5:23:17] <DrkJP520> I payed pokemon yellow a couple of years ago for the first time, and i was shocked how similar it was to the modern games
[5:23:19] <%Agami23> thats not true pat.
[5:23:25] <%bevyrage> how about making some of the old problems WORSE?
[5:23:25] <T_Sasquatch> Its almost like its a stagnant series loved by children and man babies
[5:23:27] <marvel877> I just want a new Trading Card Game game on a Nintendo System. If Yugioh can keep making console games, why not Pokemon TCG???
[5:23:36] <%Agami23> they deviate all the time, they just remove the things they deviate from with every game.
[5:23:39] <%SirGO0SE> and the games have just gotten progressively easier and easier
[5:23:41] <%coffeebearCafe> it's comabt for babies
[5:23:42] <heartlesshealer> pick charmander and go to Celadon city
[5:23:42] <pilllowofbees> Its problems stem from how adamant they want to the same
[5:23:47] <%coffeebearCafe> *combat
[5:23:48] <%Zeikier> yeah the rock paper scissors feels so damn slippery slope
[5:23:51] <%SirGO0SE> the newest DLC has literally ONE trainer battle
[5:24:00] <T_Sasquatch> Pokemon will never evolve. Ironic ain't it
[5:24:04] <%TheBensonator_> No surprise for a game that basically hasn't changed in 25 years
[5:24:04] <%Emperor_Machinus> No one loves ground type pokemon
[5:24:05] <%Zeikier> that's why you play Fool's Gold or Altered Emerald
[5:24:06] <+jiggy_snipe> 3*
[5:24:09] <%Zeikier> pat play Pokemon Altered Emerald
[5:24:10] <%YakumoYomi> @zeroarturia Agreed. Monster Sanctuary doesn't look nearly as good, but the combat depth shits all over Pokemon
[5:24:13] <Snookasaurus> more like 3
[5:24:14] <Blank9> no one has 6 pokemon
[5:24:14] <%SirGO0SE> finding a trainer with a full team? LUL
[5:24:17] <marvel877> "I love water type pokemon!" "Well, here's a car battery bitch!!"
[5:24:25] <heartlesshealer> Makes me wonder if pokemon gyms are legally required to type-specialize
[5:24:27] <@SSaryn> Not even like, Dragon or Water or Fairy or anything relating to Ground in anyway.
[5:24:27] <%juxtest> Does ANY Gym Leader actucally have 6 Pokemon?
[5:24:30] <Blank9> they have 2-3, and 2 of them are the SAME ONE
[5:24:30] <%bevyrage> i find it amusing that temtem solves all of pokemon's problems but comes up with like three big new ones
[5:24:31] <%Aeoneth> Fuck you Pat my all Bird Pokemon team kicked ass
[5:24:32] <CSeriesJTYPE> im finishing my first playthrough of bayo 1 and why does every boss feel like the leviathan's heart boss from dmc3
[5:24:33] <Profmcstevie> Bitch WALK OUTSIDE there are pidgeys
[5:24:36] <+BigDumBeak> the series died to me cuz late game fights are just "use super effective move for 1 hit kill" 6 times and you win and theres no strategy anymore zzz
[5:24:39] <%Agami23> the island trials were pretty great, because it wasen't just "fight a gym leader".
[5:24:40] <%Ranryu692> 10
[5:24:42] <ReRe0183> facts
[5:24:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pokmon league has rules, tho
[5:24:49] <s1rcuit> everyone in poke world have learning disorders
[5:24:50] <%juxtest> Should your Starter type decide your Trainer type
[5:24:51] <%Zeikier> there was one other game where Lt. Surge has an electabuzz that uses Ice punch to fuck over ground types but I forgot which game
[5:24:54] <%YakumoYomi> Sword and Shield proved that "it's Pokemon" is enough. And that bothers me, because Pokemon could be SO much better
[5:24:55] <%crimsonharvest> Pat they're just semester finals in a world where school is combat in the woods
[5:24:57] <%SirGO0SE> and they dont switch Pokemon really ever
[5:25:01] <i_am_therydon> how did they make gym leader? whats the standard?
[5:25:06] <%ssjklyco> They are all Ash Ketchums
[5:25:06] <%AzureGale> "I beat fucking" - Pat
[5:25:18] <%wibbwobbler> the rival is about it, last boss tho
[5:25:21] <Profmcstevie> Colour coding matching for 10 hours WOOOOH
[5:25:23] <marvel877> Didn't Pearl run like shit and had to be fixed with Platinum?
[5:25:24] <Zeikier> yeah I don't like the endgame of Pokeyman games cuz of that
[5:25:30] <pokefan9956> don't a lot of the fangames fix this?
[5:25:34] <%AzureGale> Cynthia tho
[5:25:35] <jimmytwofeet> DIVERSIFY YO BONDS
[5:25:35] <+Ether101_Prime> Ash is going to finally talk about his dad in the new movie.
[5:25:38] <heartlesshealer> STAB bonus + type advantage = win
[5:25:44] <%TalisKanju> The Gym Leaders are there to test the challengers, thus they stick to one type
[5:25:54] <%RetroCop87> the only challenge in any of those games in Cynthia, because she has a normal varied group ok types
[5:25:54] <%Zeikier> I feel like boss fights refuse to exist in pokemon games cuz they have to stay strict to the stats instead of like, beefing up the boss trainers' mons to be hardier
[5:25:57] <+vicar_anat> but what else can Bug Catcher Joey POSSIBLY USE?!?!?!?
[5:26:01] <s1rcuit> I want it to though
[5:26:02] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt It's an established rule for gym leaders and the elite four to only use the type associated with their gym/arena. It's a league restriction, not a personal choice.
[5:26:04] <%bevyrage> i feel that it's not a test when the answer is the same one six times in a row
[5:26:05] <heartlesshealer> main game suffered to improve meta of pokemon
[5:26:11] <T_Sasquatch> I barely used type advantage. I just abused burn on fire pokemon LUL
[5:26:21] <DrkJP520> Imagine if persona was 1 on 1
[5:26:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> Well there's a reason the official Pokemon competitive tournaments are doubles only
[5:26:44] <%YakumoYomi> Play Monster Sanctuary, Pat. The combat system is 3 on 3, and features a lot of options to build your team
[5:26:47] <marvel877> BOY I'd like to hear how that new Pokemon Snap gaming is coming along
[5:26:52] <%Emperor_Machinus> @vicar_anat Poison types that use moves that spread diseases? Technically spreading "bugs"
[5:27:01] <s1rcuit> @Daniel_Is_I the problem is that everything else about Pokemon doesn't
[5:27:02] <%Ranryu692> yup
[5:27:03] <%Zeikier> IVs suck yeah
[5:27:06] <%bevyrage> @marvel877 you talking about BUGSNAX!?
[5:27:07] <s1rcuit> I agree with the Pat
[5:27:07] <+Skaphel> But Eevee is cute
[5:27:10] <T_Sasquatch> You talkin shit about eevee ?
[5:27:13] <%SirGO0SE> your take isnt crazy or off base at all and 99% of fans will agree with you
[5:27:15] <heartlesshealer> THEY FIXED IT FOR EXACTLY ONE GAME SET
[5:27:15] <Blank9> completely blow
[5:27:20] <heartlesshealer> and then broke it!
[5:27:23] <%Zeikier> yeah that's bullshit! just make Natures the beginning and end of that!
[5:27:29] <%VoidBaronJules> Gief snoring at the perfect pitch i thought my phone was buzzing
[5:27:31] <bettysharkface> The only good Pokemon game is Pokemon Go.
[5:27:35] <%juxtest> Some dumb Pokemon manga or whatever established that Gym Leaders only fight you at a level that they're confident you can beat. Basically nerfing themselves so up and coming trainers can get badges. Par example, Brock has a full party of super powered Pokemon but only uses 3 shitters if you're a nobody with nothing trainer who has no badges.
[5:27:40] <Estwilde> The games will never be the TV Show, which is what you want as a player experience. Had to come to terms with that
[5:27:40] <Blank9> it also fucks you up for just playing the game
[5:27:46] <s1rcuit> Eugenics in a kids game
[5:27:51] <Estwilde> You'll never have real fun adventures like the tv show
[5:27:53] <marvel877> I never bothered with that numbers game. I just cared about what move type and can I get the first hit in.
[5:27:54] <Blank9> you end up with shittier pokemon by playing the actual game instead of grinding the same pokemon over and over
[5:27:57] <%Zeikier> I miss when they just had a general "Stat EXP" where the more your mon fought the better their growth was
[5:28:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh everyone who plays competitively just hacks them in
[5:28:04] <%wibbwobbler> just add more types
[5:28:09] <%Zeikier> EVs make me so paranoid about how I grind and it sucks
[5:28:09] <%SirGO0SE> just cut that shit and let us pick nature
[5:28:20] <vonmaultke> Pokemon: eugenics starter set LUL
[5:28:30] <%Emperor_Machinus> @PatStaresAt My Magikarp has been breed to kill GOD!
[5:28:32] <marvel877> Train your Gardevoir all you want, she'll never fuck you.
[5:28:33] <%Zeikier> Pokemon is built on a foundation of horrible outdated ideas that they have no reason to care about fixing
[5:28:40] <%SirGO0SE> $3 pokemon monthly tax
[5:28:42] <DrkJP520> IVs don't really matter in the single player story, but yeah, you have to grind for that shit for online
[5:28:44] <%RetroCop87> It's like "why breed the perfect chocobo when you can just trade for one in Kalm
[5:28:46] <%wibbwobbler> pokemon jail lol
[5:28:48] <%Zeikier> *habits not ideas
[5:28:53] <%SShen> They made IV/EVs super fucking easy to do in SW/SH
[5:28:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> You're not gonna spend hours building up a new pokemon just to test out a strategy you might not even use
[5:28:59] <%bevyrage> btw have you gone back to temtem since you played? they've updated a ton of stuff like how you can get your skates back now
[5:29:01] <heartlesshealer> because fucking anime money
[5:29:02] <%ssjklyco> imagine pokemon by EA
[5:29:03] <ranoksi> i'll pretend i know anything about pokemon... got to catch them all or something
[5:29:08] <T_Sasquatch> Why would they EVER change the formula . It works
[5:29:12] <%cvp5127> than god for cyber sleuth
[5:29:19] <Snookasaurus> designs are awful, yeah
[5:29:19] <%coffeebearCafe> competition is good for a reason.... pokemon needs a competitor
[5:29:20] <%SirGO0SE> @SShen its super easy but if you want to do like, 30 pokemon, its going to take you a week
[5:29:26] <%RetroCop87> create a rule where you can't have more than two of a type on a team
[5:29:28] <DianaTheAscian> its super not as strong
[5:29:34] <%RetroCop87> solved
[5:29:38] <%bevyrage> HOLY FUCK WHAT? temtem was THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR
[5:29:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> EV spread is a competitively interesting idea in cases where specific EVs are set to deal with meta threats. Like Rotoms dropping their speed EVs to get the second volt switch in mirror matches
[5:29:40] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't think its art is strong
[5:29:40] <+Over_ninek> amazingly Pokemon has managed to keep the art and music quality really high
[5:29:53] <%Zeikier> ...temtem was THIS YEAR!?
[5:29:55] <heartlesshealer> @RetroCop87 that fucks over all the flying pokemon
[5:29:56] <%SaiyanShoto> I still enjoy Pokémon but ever since they went 3D It’s been a downward spiral
[5:29:57] <%YakumoYomi> @coffeebearCafe Yokai Watch was the one that got the closest...and Level-5 botched it
[5:30:00] <%Zeikier> I thought it was 2 years ago
[5:30:02] <%VoidBaronJules> oh big time
[5:30:03] <%Zeikier> oh yeah the 3D models SUCK
[5:30:05] <%Daniel_Is_I> They're just A-posing
[5:30:05] <heartlesshealer> THEY SUPER DO
[5:30:06] <DianaTheAscian> its funny cause i don't care about battling in Pokemon at all
[5:30:07] <%Ranryu692> the sprites were so much better\
[5:30:09] <marvel877> THEY SUCK. They're dead as fuck.
[5:30:09] <%ssjklyco> Hes not wrong
[5:30:10] <%Ranryu692> Fire Emblem, too
[5:30:12] <%cvp5127> hes right
[5:30:13] <%Zeikier> I miss the sprites from the first like 3 gens
[5:30:15] <Profmcstevie> It's a burden of production SO MUCH HIGHER for them it seems
[5:30:16] <T_Sasquatch> It's very hard to do
[5:30:20] <%Zeikier> Crystal had the best sprites
[5:30:23] <dukenux> no surprise here
[5:30:26] <@SSaryn> That's my main gripe too and I'm finding it so much easier to look at Monster Hunter Stories and hope they continue doing this again with Stories 2.
[5:30:27] <%RetroCop87> sprites became more and more A-posed as gens went on
[5:30:29] <%SShen> Temtem made the IV/EV shit way way harder since release and is bullshit to do now, and good luck in pvp without perfect ones
[5:30:29] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt u should look at those black and white 2 sprites they're great
[5:30:30] <DrkJP520> 3d models suck cuz they're never gonna change, and the animations are so lackluster
[5:30:30] <+Skaphel> the 3D models in what ? Pokemon ?
[5:30:30] <%Zeikier> like Gengar? he's fuckin TERRIFYING in Crystal
[5:30:32] <%coffeebearCafe> @YakumoYomi yep, they had a chance
[5:30:33] <%SirGO0SE> i miss sprites
[5:30:38] <%Agami23> i dunno about character, but they sure do lack animations
[5:30:38] <%wibbwobbler> the attacks do feel lazy
[5:30:45] <marvel877> I really hope for a Pokken sequel.
[5:30:45] <%Zeikier> also Kangaskhan's back sprite in FR/LG is adorable
[5:30:45] <Estwilde> They still refuse to have them say their names, right? It's still *electronic screech*?
[5:30:46] <%dozind16> Sprites be missed
[5:30:47] <%VoidBaronJules> i was so ged up from going from sapphire to the 3d models
[5:30:47] <Profmcstevie> Fat Pikachu was designed for battle
[5:30:50] <s1rcuit> to me Pokemon peaked at Gold and Silver
[5:30:51] <%Emperor_Machinus> Bring back the sprites and art of pokemon gold/silver
[5:30:51] <dukenux> I stan Fat Pikachu
[5:31:06] <CrypticMochi> The stadium models had personality I think?
[5:31:08] <@SSaryn> Yeah it's pretty fucked up.
[5:31:11] <+b_aleph> Wailord's model sucks
[5:31:13] <Dutchpotato> Yeah
[5:31:17] <%coffeebearCafe> pokemon is just lazy all around
[5:31:20] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[5:31:31] <$Afterman_> just hire the monster hunter rigging guys, ez pz
[5:31:33] <T_Sasquatch> Ehhh recent pokemon have kinda been ass
[5:31:36] <%NopeBadguy> There's a lot of quantity over quality in Pokemon design philosophy and sadly a lot of people would rather have a lot of turds rather than one good meal
[5:31:39] <Profmcstevie> Dragon Quest 11 is the perfect example of LOVING your cast of creatures, Pokemons numbers are out of control
[5:31:41] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder how many pokemon equal 1 monster in monster hunter
[5:31:41] <%Zeikier> the 3D models are so stupid and utilitarian under its obligation to fit all its stupid amounts of idiots in their games
[5:31:42] <Ranger747> trainers, too I think
[5:31:43] <%VoidBaronJules> @CrypticMochi yeah forgot stadium but you're right
[5:31:47] <NitronStreams> I just wish they had focussed on changing up the game instead of adding 100 more pokemon for every goddamn gen
[5:31:49] <%SaiyanShoto> Black and White 2 was the last great Pokémon game
[5:31:51] <s1rcuit> loot tables
[5:31:52] <%SirGO0SE> if a company that wasnt Game Freak made a Pokemon game, omg
[5:31:56] <CSeriesJTYPE> they need AI scripting
[5:31:58] <marvel877> You'd think Pokemon would have had design contests like Mega Man had Robot Master design contests.
[5:32:02] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt limping
[5:32:03] <heartlesshealer> Pokemon Stadium was OUTSOURCED
[5:32:11] <$Afterman_> i would honestly say the monster hunter games should serve as like a reference point in terms of how well characterized those monsters are
[5:32:21] <%wibbwobbler> it's an annual thing now
[5:32:24] <%SaiyanShoto> What sucks is I’m sure the devs actually want to change shit up and do more but the higher ups are like nah
[5:32:25] <+EasyAsDan> Dont forget they reused the models from the 3DS games for the Switch games
[5:32:30] <$Afterman_> oh god tri was my FIRST monster hunter game, I loved the fuck out of it
[5:32:31] <Profmcstevie> They got REAL GOOD at pushing out not only old monsters but BRAND NEW monsters
[5:32:37] <T_Sasquatch> It's not 70 😂😂😂
[5:32:40] <DrkJP520> Problem with pokemon is they gotta release a game regularly, and they clearly don't get enough time/resources
[5:32:42] <@SSaryn> 32 I think at the start, a little more than 60 in Iceborne.
[5:32:46] <ergulor> i want more giginox
[5:32:47] <%Emperor_Machinus> How many for me?
[5:32:47] <DianaTheAscian> ITS NOT 70PAT
[5:32:49] <dan_g_v> khezu is coming to dave the day with its phallic stretchy neck
[5:32:50] <%Zeikier> Jade Cocoon 1 put way more effort compared to pokemon too. There's like 9 different animations for about 16 unique species of monster, on the PS!
[5:32:51] <%VoidBaronJules> see pokemon could do what monster hunter world done, with cutting down with the new game/region and building up with dlc
[5:32:57] <$Afterman_> maybe 45?
[5:32:58] <%TalisKanju> The models were fine on 3DS
[5:33:00] <%YakumoYomi> 71 large?
[5:33:03] <%SirGO0SE> @EasyAsDan and didnt they claim they didnt but got blown up? LUL
[5:33:04] <pilllowofbees> it practically doubled
[5:33:14] <s1rcuit> @marvel877 there's a guy on da called ultimatemaverickx who I think earned a spot in capcom for his megaman art
[5:33:14] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt prob in the 50s
[5:33:17] <$Afterman_> iceborn added 31 new monsters
[5:33:20] <$Afterman_> so yea higher than 45
[5:33:23] <Dutchpotato> Icebourne added 30 and than the 5 dlc
[5:33:28] <T_Sasquatch> Are you counting variants or subspecies ?
[5:33:30] <%Zeikier> if Pokemon went back to like, sprites but maybe super details they could prolly save on space
[5:33:39] <pokefan9956> It'd be interesting to see what could be done if the fan games were able to work with the newest models
[5:33:40] <@SSaryn> Which is a little under 70 or 70 yeah.
[5:33:42] <%Grimlockfly> Pokémon should be Monster Hunter , but fir kids at this point
[5:33:42] <jimmytwofeet> 54 total
[5:33:43] <%Zeikier> it's not like crazy good sprites aren't possible, shit look at Valkyrie Profile
[5:33:47] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt In total, not including things like Arch Tempered and only Large monsters, it's at like 80
[5:33:48] <dan_g_v> you heard Pat, we need dlc in pokemon
[5:33:54] <+b_aleph> Aren't a lot of the iceborne's just pallette swaps tho?
[5:33:58] <%wibbwobbler> rise looks way too sicc
[5:34:06] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt didn't generations have like 100?
[5:34:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> I want Agnaktor and Lagiacrus back SO BADLY
[5:34:14] <%weissguard> Bring back the bugs from 4/4U dang it!
[5:34:17] <$Afterman_> i just counted
[5:34:20] <$Afterman_> SEVENTY ONE monsters
[5:34:21] <+mrredwednesday> big true
[5:34:22] <%coffeebearCafe> lmao yeah
[5:34:23] <heartlesshealer> pokemon dlc currently is just the pokemon giveaways
[5:34:23] <jimmytwofeet> They have new moves too
[5:34:26] <Profmcstevie> A subspecies in Monster Hunter is still a ton of work
[5:34:27] <T_Sasquatch> Fulgur anjanth is pretty cool
[5:34:32] <+EasyAsDan> @EasyAsDan And people defend them as if they arent the most successful IP ever LUL
[5:34:33] <DianaTheAscian> the pallets swaps do get new moves
[5:34:35] <@SSaryn> We also have confirmed new moves for returning monsters too
[5:34:36] <%YakumoYomi> @Zeikier Hell, just look at Vanillaware. They're arguably the kings of 2D spritework nowadays
[5:34:42] <%SGrim> And Juratodos is back, wee
[5:34:46] <%coffeebearCafe> plus armor and weapons for each monster
[5:34:46] <AdmiralButtloaf> but isnt a goku just a pallet swap?
[5:34:48] <%Zeikier> right?
[5:34:48] <%Emperor_Machinus> @weissguard Yeah bug catcher joey wants bugs back

[5:35:35] <ranoksi> Who ?
[5:35:42] <marvel877> FROM THE START
