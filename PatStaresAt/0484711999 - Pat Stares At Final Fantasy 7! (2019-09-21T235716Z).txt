[0:02:23] <simulationbard> @derekwst3 any good?
[0:02:41] <+templar010> ayy ffvii is back
[0:02:49] <LandOfTheWay> promare is just an entire movie of Studio Trigger nonsense nonstop and i fucking love it
[0:02:53] <%NWR_James> It's basically just Gurren with all the plot stuff cut out and mashed into 1:40
[0:02:57] <%Ranryu692> Promare isn't as good as Gurren Lagann or Kill la Kill, but it's still very good
[0:02:58] <Nina96> KonCha
[0:03:10] <yodajr99> promare sounds cool
[0:03:15] <%derekwst3> @simulationbard it had its moments, the beginning was boring

[0:03:26] <%zamzoph> @CJett92 didn't like the movie-condensed drama very much, and some of the fast-paced action moments could've used more frames for the CG to make it more comprehensible
[0:03:32] <+sixcubit> hey chat, never watched a ff7 stream before. how far in is pat?1
[0:03:33] <%NWR_James> Imagine if they had to tell the story of KLK in an hour 40 and decided "Action is the important part"

[0:13:22] <GiygasDrillBreak> the most disgusting thing about skin is what's behind it
[0:13:23] <katawa_gilbert> Why not just spray the baby wipes with Hand Sanitizers? You're not being very effective
[0:13:25] <OhioNitsud> look at that controller glisten

[0:15:59] <+Wrashis> so i lost all my dissidia p3p and portable ops files
[0:16:00] <%JohnAtDawn> The real question is if Pat will stream Crisis Core after this game.
[0:16:01] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat why don't you get a UV light designed for curing fake nails to sterilize your controller, it would be a prefect fit
[0:16:01] <%Skullgonian> I can’t share my resub apatPorgmo
[0:16:05] <Aydarkzero> it's seriously weird b/c i remember staying at Sephy's final boss save and thats it

[0:16:12] <Valdorick> FF9 is a good game, but we all know FF6 is the best.
[0:16:12] <PrimeNeverproc> ff9 is totally better.
[0:16:15] <%Meekest> @starotter70 What ABOUT 8
[0:16:16] <ShichiNoBushi> You playing FF6 ever?
[0:16:22] <%starotter70> LUL
[0:16:24] <%ShaneWhite> Just wait till FF76
[0:16:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> ff9 isn't better than 7 in anything other than gameplay
[0:16:30] <%Big_Dream> ff8= bad
[0:16:30] <AdmiralButtloaf> its actually easier with cheats and 3x speed
[0:16:31] <ShichiNoBushi> Especially butt germs.
[0:16:33] <%stovetopism> Its so weird that Final Fantasy just went right to 9 after 7 huh?
[0:16:33] <%templar010> I enjoy FF9 more than FF7 but understand both of these are the correct choices over 8 Kappa

[0:35:19] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat some people have it where they have to like, touch their doorknob exactly 37 times, and go up the stairs then down the stairs then halfway back up then down again, otherwise they have crippling anxiety all day.
[0:35:20] <zafooru> Man, i'd like to have some rituals that get me snacks or something
[0:35:21] <laserbeaming> Pat has just enough OCD to be amusing but not enough to be crippling
[0:35:29] <+vaporousTippler> If I perform an action on the right, I have to do something of comparable attention on the left, or it feels off-balance.

[0:36:54] <Valdorick> So what I'm hearing is - we all need to make SCPs or OoPs

[0:36:56] <%ssjklyco> It's a hannah barbara background
[0:36:57] <$humbelpie> @AngriestPat Pat will you ever play the infamous Gundam FMV game Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 The Battle for Earth?

[0:37:09] <rytisone> everything must be CLEAN
[0:37:12] <%SummonerMagno> like the volume having to be in multiples of 5
[0:37:16] <%littleogre92> at what point is this a disorder?
[0:37:22] <%starotter70> Yeah, just don't let it set in
[0:37:24] <%filialpails> OCD is when you need SCP containment procedures for your own brain
[0:37:33] <%TDotGoat> actual shit?
[0:37:37] <%sshen> Pat just wants a happy clean life
[0:37:44] <+Wrashis> switch go to slep
[0:37:45] <%crimsonharvest> @littleogre92 the typical definition is when it affects the subject's quality of life

[0:38:08] <%sshen> Pat is just Kira without the hand fetish and the will to murder
[0:38:08] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I've had anxiety for most my life, only got recently diagnosed, and holy SHIT the number of "low level" rituals I do fucking blew me away when I identified them. One of them, no joke, is exactly the one you have with volume settings - it has to end in an even number or failing that, a 5. Like... I'll even tamper with other people's stuff because it bothers me so much.
[0:38:08] <%Ascethetic> Baige
[0:38:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Guess what sucks more? OCD that basically forces you to think about things that you dont want to at all times

[0:40:25] <rytisone> make a song about it
[0:40:28] <%RubberFistFight> @cureneckbeard it's mostly due to how strong the elastic they use is. And most of them cheap the fuck out because they were designed to penny-pinch as much as possible.

[0:44:56] <%Futurecity10> I didnt know Epstien went to game stop
[0:44:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's very not fun
[0:45:01] <+buttdirt> "siri, call 911"
[0:45:01] <ExpressNode> Is it 911 in Canada too?
[0:45:05] <%noobpsyboticus> I want to hear more of that story
[0:45:10] <+Grayhammatter> pat is not cool
[0:45:10] <Bailey__gaming> 912
[0:45:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @ExpressNode In most of canada, yeah
[0:45:13] <%UW_Duncan> @FBI
[0:45:14] <%derekwst3> @ExpressNode nope, he just is crazy
[0:45:15] <+Grayhammatter> but he's alright
[0:45:17] <jellssssss20> Yes it’s 911 in Canada too
[0:45:20] <%Deano8817> nice
[0:45:20] <+Bad1uck> LOL more like drop it off and have them come back in 2 hours. (dials 911)
[0:45:27] <%starotter70> woaw
[0:45:36] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat it is a good question
[0:45:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> In some places they don;t have 911, but those are the little bumfuck towns
[0:45:39] <Valdorick> Because America fucked up so bad while visiting canada that Canada HAD to change it.
[0:45:41] <%NeroInfinite> in the UK it's some daft shit like 111
[0:45:41] <%DedlokPM> Dan "I just realized I don't know how butter is made" Rykert
[0:45:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> Neuf-Onze
[0:45:43] <%RubberFistFight> @Futurecity10 that whole fucking situation has me really cross and ticked off. Not to mention the fact that I fucking called exactly what would happen the second he got arrested.
[0:45:46] <poweredscoot> but is it 9/21?
[0:45:48] <+Ell1ot> it used to be a different number, right?
[0:45:50] <dredgyboi> in Ireland it is meant to be 999, but 911 works too because it is sucha culturally recognised thing
[0:45:52] <%arancet> wasnt it different in canada but they had to change it to 911 cause thats what everyone knew from movies/tv?
[0:45:53] <rainwater739> Oh lord
[0:45:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> UK is 112. France is 119
[0:45:55] <%filialpails> north american numbering plan, all phone number stuff is the same
[0:45:56] <%starotter70> :D
[0:45:58] <%Razputin217> 999 EMERGENCY
[0:45:58] <%sshen> In the uk it's 999, 111 is non emergency
[0:46:00] <%ElenaManetta> you canadians and your crazy customs
[0:46:07] <PrimeNeverproc> 112 is eu
[0:46:07] <%Ynkubus18> the uk is 999 for emergencies, 111 is for non emergencies
[0:46:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> Or I just don;t know anything
[0:46:10] <+wjones0415> mind=blown!
[0:46:10] <rytisone> scream outta window 'HALP'
[0:46:17] <SomersaultJustice> 119
[0:46:18] <%Omegaanimus> 0118 999 881 999 119 725 3
[0:46:19] <Bailey__gaming> it's 999 @neroinfinite 111 is non eeemergency
[0:46:21] <%starotter70> You guys have non emergencies!?
[0:46:23] <ginjais> @dredgyboi I did not know that actually, I'm Irish too lol
[0:46:26] <AdmiralButtloaf> you said this like a week ago i think. either that or i was watching an old podcast
[0:46:35] <+Bad1uck> more like dial 99881999119725
[0:46:38] <%derekwst3> my sister called the cops on me, because i grounded her and put told her to go to her room
[0:46:42] <%sjay449> If people want more context about the story, this dude basically was asking about the fact he got a virus from downloading his porn and wanted us to remove it. And I just said "sir, this is a walmart"
[0:46:45] <cureneckbeard> I think 911 works in the UK too because of all the kids who watched too much American TV
[0:46:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Took me a while to realize that the police station has its own number
[0:46:47] <%NeroInfinite> alway remember the emergency number for the country you are visiting.
[0:46:53] <%Mekhet09> That sounds awful.
[0:46:57] <+buttdirt> @Ynkubus18 uuhhh...what would be considered a non-emergency?
[0:46:57] <%Deano8817> our bad
[0:47:01] <%some_sunflowers> I feel like I tuned in a weird time.
[0:47:01] <ginjais> so you're saying 911 is a meme
[0:47:02] <+SilverFaustX> lol
[0:47:07] <%Ion_Laser> oops
[0:47:08] <%starotter70> That sounds about right
[0:47:09] <%skizzuto> when I was like 4 I was playing pretend that there was a fire in my house and called 911
[0:47:11] <+Kairi__> 911 is actually a meme for real
[0:47:11] <+Bad1uck> @omegaanimus was that from memory?
[0:47:19] <Dumple_Roe> @ginjais very useful meme
[0:47:19] <dredgyboi> same here in ireland:D!
[0:47:19] <%Omegaanimus> half
[0:47:21] <%ssjklyco> America invades canada once again
[0:47:21] <+SilverFaustX> its 112 here
[0:47:22] <%Meekest> Mistakes into Miracles
[0:47:22] <%ThatOneGameTester> can confirm, i totally called it as a kid
[0:47:22] <RupanSen> Pat, it's like I'm listening to my fucking grampa, and I'm the same age as you
[0:47:22] <SomersaultJustice> and so, canada reformed their healrh care
[0:47:22] <%ElenaManetta> connect to a message that just says "you're fucked"
[0:47:23] <%skizzuto> the fire department was not happy
[0:47:23] <%gespenst25> Call Whitehall 1212
[0:47:23] <Bailey__gaming> @starotter been robbed? 111 actuall robber in house call 999
[0:47:25] <%mh9s> american cultural imperialism strikes again
[0:47:25] <MattoBii> thanks american media@
[0:47:26] <Golden_Battler> 911 is an actual meme
[0:47:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> culture wins uhnH
[0:47:34] <%starotter70> @skizzuto I would imagine
[0:47:36] <rytisone> 911 is all about connecting, like death stranding
[0:47:42] <%filialpails> thanks american cultural hegemony
[0:47:44] <Flarepulse> culture has been imposed upon you
[0:47:44] <%SoySocks> in the US, 811 is for knowing where to safely dig
[0:47:47] <%Omegaanimus> But BEST emergency number is: 0118 999 881 999 119 725 3
[0:47:48] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> I came in here at the wrong time? What are you talking about?
[0:47:49] <Nina96> there r numbers for a medical question?
[0:47:49] <%joylent_blue> you'd be amazed the kind of things you can memorize if there's a song attached to the memory
[0:47:52] <Valdorick> In Civ5, the Culture Victory comes when every world leader bitches about their people wearing your nation's skinny jeans. In the real world, America 'wins' by forcing other nations to adopt 911 Kappa
[0:47:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Also, according to the wikipedia thinger for 112, it's a mobile emergency number for all of Europe and Asia. It works alongside 999 in the UK
[0:47:57] <%Ynkubus18> @buttdirt its mainly for the nhs for advice
[0:47:58] <ShichiNoBushi> 411 is information. Not sure what nature of that is supposed to be, though.
[0:47:59] <+thefakeh> they even added 911 as a number within australia, it re-routes to the actual emergency number 000
[0:48:01] <%Ascethetic> 411 isinformation is the US
[0:48:02] <%ElenaManetta> oh yeah, free health care
[0:48:05] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat same here in Australia, ours is 000 but they had to implement a 911 redirect, partly due to idiots who watch too much TV, but also because of American tourists who didn't do their due diligence and expected 911 to be the same everywhere.
[0:48:07] <%Ascethetic> in*
[0:48:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> We have 311 and 611
[0:48:10] <+buttdirt> @Ynkubus18 i see, makes sense
[0:48:10] <+Bad1uck> O shit
[0:48:13] <%vaporousTippler> 311 is a shitty band that needs to be forgotten.
[0:48:14] <$Quigsies> Wow, that sounds helpful
[0:48:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ShichiNoBushi hold over from before the internet
[0:48:15] <%zamzoph> it's cancer
[0:48:17] <TastySammiches> NYC has a 311 line for when you wanna complain at someone but its not an emergency
[0:48:18] <simulationbard> That sounds super useful
[0:48:18] <sakeydo> Bet paige needs that number A LOT
[0:48:18] <%starotter70> Neat
[0:48:21] <%Conyst> @omegaanimus is that the one from IT Crowd?
[0:48:23] <%Kiiper> we started using 000 in australia back in the sixties so we had less of that issue
[0:48:26] <+pleblu> what's that in the states....
[0:48:28] <Balsty> LOL
[0:48:30] <%miguelrod777> you're technically dead right now
[0:48:31] <%Omegaanimus> @conyst Yes
[0:48:31] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:48:32] <%nmaten> investigate 311
[0:48:34] <%Deano8817> that's oddly specific pat
[0:48:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> 311 is the number for the City of Calgary so you tell them takis are being dickheads
[0:48:35] <%Ranryu692> in New York you can dial 311 to talk to the city
[0:48:39] <rainwater739> @AngriestPat Can we just have chat nights like this in the future? This is fun and informative!
[0:48:41] <%mh9s> it does seem like something that should be standardized across all nations
[0:48:42] <%RubberFistFight> @Kiiper nah we still had it bigtime in the mid-to-late 90s.
[0:48:42] <+dawsfloss> or ate some pods
[0:48:43] <Bailey__gaming> ah we have that in uk
[0:48:44] <%Omegaanimus> Just email the fire department
[0:48:45] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> Glue tastes good though
[0:48:45] <%ElenaManetta> pat had a resposne for that like he knew
[0:48:46] <+Grayhammatter> if it's super glue, you're FUCKED

[0:50:01] <%Ynkubus18> Panic attacks are annoyingly fucky
[0:50:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That'll be 10k
[0:50:01] <+Eddy21forsaken> they filled you with maple syrup?
[0:50:01] <%Iccirrus> I know how that shit is
[0:50:03] <%UW_Duncan> Troponin levels are normal = panic attack
[0:50:05] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat I have the same story but mine ended in surgery PogChamp
[0:50:07] <ShichiNoBushi> I wish we had free healthcare.
[0:50:08] <%nmaten> at least you didnt have a 17,000 dollar bill
[0:50:08] <Ryzarelly> Your heart trolled you!!!
[0:50:08] <%stovetopism> everytime i have chest pains my doctor always says "Its GERD mother fucker take a tums"
[0:50:10] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> comfy needles <3
[0:50:11] <%Iccirrus> had the same thing happen a few years back
[0:50:11] <%derekwst3> poison control at least for me is 1 800 222 1222 @AngriestPat
[0:50:13] <%Razputin217> That'll be $300,000 Dollars
[0:50:13] <%Ranryu692> that would ruin your life, financially, in the States
[0:50:13] <rytisone> also they stole your blood and sold it
[0:50:14] <%skizzuto> happened to me while I was going through chemo
[0:50:15] <+Bad1uck> yeah, heart tissue death has special chemicals
[0:50:15] <%Iccirrus> didn't leave my room for a week after that
[0:50:21] <%miguelrod777> you're brain trolled the shit outta you
[0:50:23] <%RubberFistFight> oh man my first panic attack I thought I was fucking DYING, it sucked. Like holy shit, human biology, why are you so fucked that you FALSE FLAG A HEART ATTACK when I'm not doin well emotionally? How the fuck is that going to help?
[0:50:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> THOUGHTS ON CALIPH TRUDEAU?
[0:50:25] <TastySammiches> @AngriestPat at least they didn't charge you $20,000 for that
[0:50:25] <FirewallStorm> but Pat you like the metal in you
[0:50:27] <%Koosahmii> At least your healthcare is free....
[0:50:27] <%vaporousTippler> "You're not dying." "Fuck you!"
[0:50:29] <SlimeSlimeSlime> You know, Pat, SOME people would refer to spending the evening with needles in their arms as a good thing. =D
[0:50:31] <%Conyst> Panic attacks absolutely suck
[0:50:32] <Bailey__gaming> Accupuncture ftw
[0:50:33] <%starotter70> Pat's heart: "I was just pretending to die"
[0:50:35] <%JetpackMcQuack> IGNORE ME
[0:50:37] <FirewallStorm> it makes you more far away from flesh
[0:50:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> CappuccinoGuil subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! I've stuck around for 7 months? thanks for having me around, folks. It's been a rough couple of months, just got diagnosed with diabetes, but the treatment is really helping me NOT feel like shit all the time, which is awesome.
[0:50:40] <Graxe_> Yeah, in the US, 811 is to call for safe digging sites for digging projects so that you don't hit power or gas lines and other safety things.
[0:50:41] <marvel877> ITS BEETS
[0:50:41] <cureneckbeard> panic attacks is fake news
[0:50:46] <%MasterDecoder> Anyone almost have their Appendix almost burst? SHIT HURTS
[0:50:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> NO POLITICS
[0:50:46] <digaogrunge> Meditation helps with my stupid panic attacks
[0:50:47] <%radda343> those are the best kind!
[0:50:51] <zafooru> yeah thats how it do
[0:50:51] <Mrzero58 > THOSE ARE THE FUCKING WORSE!
[0:50:51] <%crimsonharvest> I've been to the hospital twice with anxiety-driven symptoms that mimic a heart attack but I have to go, because my family history means the risk for doing nothing is elevated
[0:50:51] <+SilverFaustX> 250am here..
[0:50:55] <+Eddy21forsaken> the mind goblins have struck
[0:50:55] <Dementedpenguin> I literally tuned in a minute ago.
[0:50:57] <%Wurmspawn> And then you went tot he barber and got spit in your hair for asking them not to talk to you.
[0:50:58] <%Ion_Laser> @MasterDecoder Yeah that shit sucked
[0:50:59] <%Quigsies> Yup
[0:51:00] <kingbaconcrispy> The worst thing with the panic attack is the part when you feel deathinching closer but it turns out you had nothing.
[0:51:00] <%ssjklyco> 22

[0:51:09] <%Kain5707> THEY ARE AWFUL
[0:51:10] <%Omegaanimus> If I'm NOT having a panic attack then something isn't right
[0:51:11] <Flarepulse> does America have 811? that shit sounds useful
[0:51:11] <zafooru> in my experience anxiety attacks have triggers and panic attacks kinda just happen
[0:51:12] <ShichiNoBushi> Not that I can recall.
[0:51:13] <+CaptainGrime> ive had a few
[0:51:15] <%JetpackMcQuack> In public NotLikeThis
[0:51:16] <%miguelrod777> I dunno man that's reaching

[0:51:31] <Ryzarelly> Fight or Flight
[0:51:33] <%mh9s> the roof, the roof, the roof
[0:51:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> FFVII is old wnough to drink legally in the United Stares
[0:51:35] <+garfgarog> @angriestpat we are hear for the steve bushemi picture
[0:51:36] <+Ell1ot> i think i've gotten really anxious. i've never had the chest pain like you described
[0:51:39] <+IronPickle> Some of us are just old and have no life
[0:51:41] <mistageeza> It was from nothing, all he had was a sixpack of redbull
[0:51:41] <rytisone> piss on it
[0:51:42] <%Razputin217> THIS IS FINE
[0:51:42] <RupanSen> just a bit
[0:51:43] <%Jhylla81> I had a panic attack before because I ran into my ex
[0:51:44] <ospreyworks> Weighted blankets are the shit man. They’ve significantly improved my sleep.
[0:51:44] <simulationbard> Like when you get a random chest pain and you know it's probably nothing but then you can't stop thinking about it and you can't tell if it's getting worse and your about to die or if it's all in your head
[0:51:44] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> You could say I have
[0:51:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> THIS IS FINE
[0:51:45] <%MasterDecoder> @Ion_Laser Happened to me last year, had a tumor taken out with it
[0:51:48] <digaogrunge> Thats just regular ass panic
[0:51:48] <Valdorick> Reasonable Panic Attacks - Not Reasonable Panic Attacks. "There's a spider on my keyboard." "There MIGHT be a spider in my walls."
[0:51:49] <%ElenaManetta> no, you run from the fire, That's why Pat is panicking. He runs towards fire!
[0:51:53] <%skizzuto> next time don't drop your mixtape in your house
[0:51:55] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat the worst part is the whole snowball effect/"catastrophisation" thing that happens. You likely covered that in your psych degree, yeah?
[0:51:57] <%Iccirrus> Yes Pat, yes it is
[0:51:57] <%Omegaanimus> Medical marijuana does WONDERS for panic attacks
[0:51:57] <Nina96> life is a fuck

[0:57:09] <%Meekest> Nintendo Pat
[0:57:10] <ginjais> some of my friends told me there was no way they weren't gonna add new stuff so it was worth full price, but... I don't think they did lol
[0:57:12] <PrimeNeverproc> or ff7
[0:57:12] <zafooru> yeah i was looking forward to it but that price point gets a no from me
[0:57:13] <%TimetodiveLTX> that's a good argument for piracy
[0:57:13] <+Ell1ot> i would've liked the game with the old graphics
[0:57:17] <%Deano8817> nice
[0:57:18] <Nina96> @AngriestPat was your complaint actually a chance to shill?

[0:57:42] <%ThatOneGameTester> @joylent_blue exchange rate with us dollar is pretty bad right now so everything here in canada costs most by the same percentage
[0:57:43] <kingbaconcrispy> I hate how games are priced here. Also, since it's a Nintendo game it never loses it's value and is always overpriced, even in pawnshops.
[0:57:43] <%Mekhet09> @AngriestPat I beat the game in 10 hours. I really wish I waited. It's super good but yeah it's not worth 60.

[1:01:51] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat "disorder" or "condition" would work there
[1:01:52] <Ner234> NO

[1:02:06] <Ner234> Shenanigans
[1:02:06] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh actually the best word might be "idiosyncrasy"
[1:02:07] <%ElenaManetta> "Quirks"
[1:02:07] <%Chatterbox1991> @AngriestPat the term now is Neural Divergence, appearantly
[1:02:09] <$Chimeraelite> huh?
[1:02:11] <%Ynkubus18> Shennigans
[1:02:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Yeah, that's right, I said it, I'm ON TIME
[1:02:15] <%badchoice5> I avoid cracks when I walk and only take 1 fewer, the same, or 1 more step between each crack. I actually started to like it
[1:02:16] <zafooru> three is too few, and six is to many
[1:02:17] <Kamgin> Hey Pat
[1:02:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's just being careful to make sure it's locked.
[1:02:19] <ShichiNoBushi> You mentioned a term for that during the Control LP.
[1:02:20] <%ElenaManetta> Is your mom Charlie's mother?
[1:02:21] <%zamzoph> That's a medically-accurate term
[1:02:21] <%SoySocks> i remember reading a fictional book about a girl with OCD that would do the Hail Mary prayer a lot and would kiss doorknobs
[1:02:21] <%filialpails> if you lock it six times it won't work!
[1:02:22] <%shiny_prinny> bop it, twist it
[1:02:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean.....twice is okay??
[1:02:26] <%stagemage> well yeah the first four dont stick. we all know this
[1:02:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't describe your mom's sexlife
[1:02:28] <Deimos002> Turning the light off and on ten times before going to sleep
[1:02:32] <%RantingRavager> @AngriestPat is the proper term "Neurodivergent?"
[1:02:45] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat well at least you know eher you got it from
[1:02:48] <%gespenst25> THAT'S JUST GOOD SENSE. How will you know it's locked!?
[1:02:48] <b1gboss007> i do that with my car door NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:03:01] <%zamzoph> What if it didn't lock tho?
[1:03:06] <jerobees> I only lock the car twice
[1:03:08] <cureneckbeard> This is like the Byzantine Generals problem
[1:03:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Can't say "mentally retarded" any more.
[1:03:36] <Dementedpenguin> Chat literally stopped to listen. LUL
[1:03:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> we live... in a society
[1:03:43] <%badchoice5> yep
[1:03:44] <jerobees> Euphimism Treadmill
[1:03:48] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah if they create "jackass proof" language, they just come up with a better jackass.
[1:03:51] <%ElenaManetta> That's why you make the new words as long and unappealing as possible
[1:03:53] <cureneckbeard> You can't use the R-word any more. That's our word
[1:03:55] <gekizenbu> euphenism arms race
[1:03:57] <%ElenaManetta> Mental disorder?
[1:03:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> You neurodiverge LUL
[1:03:57] <%badchoice5> alt right has gotten real good at corrupting words
[1:04:05] <%ElenaManetta> That replaced "illness" for awhile
[1:04:08] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat and now we call them mind goblins
[1:04:09] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> go back to retard
[1:04:10] <poweredscoot> internet makes jackasses stronger
[1:04:13] <%RubberFistFight> @ShichiNoBushi yeah even though that particular phrase has a specific clinical meaning. Can't use it anymore because shitcunts ruined it.
[1:04:22] <%StaceMcGate> and before that it was Donkey Brains
[1:04:23] <$Chimeraelite> It defines itself @AngriestPat
[1:04:31] <%Basch71> george carlin even made a stand up bit on word changes over time LuL
[1:04:36] <%zamzoph> that's retarded
[1:04:36] <zafooru> i cant wait until describing my condition sounds like i'm casting a spell on whoever is nearby
[1:04:38] <%Razputin217> Didn't George Carlin do a bit about something like this?
[1:04:41] <%ElenaManetta> Call it "brain fart problems"
[1:04:43] <+gamerboy385> I can't imagine some meat head using the word neurodivergent
[1:04:43] <bleugh> just don't be assholes 4Head
[1:04:47] <%RubberFistFight> "idiot" actually used to be a clinical term as well for people who had (iirc) an IQ below 80. @AngriestPat
[1:04:51] <Valdorick> The proper term is that those people have "Ass-burgers"
[1:04:56] <cureneckbeard> specialbrainz
[1:04:56] <%SoySocks> @Razputin217 i believe the bit was called "soft language"
[1:04:58] <Deimos002> I'm not an alcoholic, I'm self medicating :)
[1:04:59] <+ZeoGold_> "Brain Bruh moment"
[1:04:59] <BaronVonMagpie> mental illness is not being neurodivergent, it covers a much broader array of often acquired symptoms
[1:05:01] <%genowyn> I feel like there should be some sort of distinction between like, autism and depression
[1:05:02] <%badchoice5> The world cannot be saved, time to purge it and move to the moon
[1:05:05] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Idiot used to be a medical term for the most severe cases of mental retardation
[1:05:07] <%starotter70> That's me!?
[1:05:08] <$Chimeraelite> it's SO good
[1:05:10] <%TDotGoat> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin

[1:09:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat you have to go all the way around
[1:09:45] <LandOfTheWay> *that's all nomura was thinking when he made the games
[1:09:46] <rainwater739> @AngriestPat Music a little loud compared to your voice.
[1:09:47] <ginjais> do big loop
[1:09:51] <%skizzuto> just git gud
[1:09:53] <%shiny_prinny> you have to go around through the bottom

[1:09:57] <%ssjklyco> we did this last time. you have to dig down to dig up
[1:10:00] <%Jhylla81> I used to play Triple Triad at lunch during high school and last period. I had a bunch of the physical cards and the ff9 soundtrack

[1:10:07] <ExpressNode> I know people always shit on Chrono Cross but what makes it so shitty?
[1:10:11] <ginjais> you can get back up there I'm like 80% sure lol
[1:10:13] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You picked a GREAT spot to stop playing for 2+ weeks
[1:10:14] <cureneckbeard> Is Jenova an SCP
[1:10:16] <supuhmagikarp> go to the east exit, not the southen one
[1:10:17] <animalxer> also don't forget to pick up the sniper CR for free crits
[1:10:20] <+garfgarog> Everything about CC is shit
[1:10:20] <%StaceMcGate> Real Talk, Chrono Cross biggest detriment is having 30 party members. Lack of Double/Triple techs was a huge loss
[1:10:26] <SomersaultJustice> no, keep it loud
[1:10:26] <%Wurmspawn> You can't without coming back to Nibleheim later. You were supposed to drop the ladder before dropping through the tubes.

[1:13:49] <Bigbossman91> @AngriestPat Hey Pat do you plan on streaming the FF14 5.1 patch when it comes out?
[1:13:54] <%QueequegTheater> I'm confused, why is that good
[1:13:57] <%TimetodiveLTX> now do slots
[1:13:58] <%starotter70> I like this game but the maps can be a little hard to navigate sometimes
[1:13:59] <%laserbeaming> They better keep Dolphin Blow in FF7R
[1:14:00] <%derekwst3> never happening again
[1:14:05] <%Big_King_Coconut> can't you press Square or something to pause the roulettes in this game?
[1:14:15] <rytisone> FF7 2K20
[1:14:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is it a raid or an expansion?
[1:14:16] <%skizzuto> YES Nier raid

[1:14:30] <+NerevaRising> What version of ff7 is this?
[1:14:31] <%StaceMcGate> Are we fighting Adam & Steve in the raid?
[1:14:31] <+IronPickle> I sure wouldn't mind if Tifa gave me a dolphin blow
[1:14:34] <%SpcOpsBear> The Mandervillains will be out to kick ass
[1:14:35] <%Conyst> Master Hand is coming for Clumbo

[1:14:47] <%SummonerMagno> "us"
[1:14:49] <@SSaryn> 2P BOIS
[1:14:53] <%QueequegTheater> @TimetodiveLTX it's literally a NieR crossover

[1:15:09] <%StaceMcGate> 2P?
[1:15:09] <+VanaSkiller> LUL
[1:15:10] <%SpcOpsBear> "Canon"
[1:15:10] <LeotheHuntsman> canon?
[1:15:11] <reonome> "canon"
[1:15:12] <%ssjklyco> OH god damnit Yoko Taro
[1:15:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> 2p
[1:15:13] <%VantomPayne> dont fucking forget, Yoko Taro put a sequel behind 80 hours of a mmo that has 0 thing to do with Nier
[1:15:14] <+FennecZephyr> i still need to beat nier
[1:15:14] <+Ya_boi_wally > YOKO IS OFF THE GOOP
[1:15:14] <LandOfTheWay> "canon"
[1:15:16] <%SGrim> YEE HAW
[1:15:17] <rainwater739> I have no idea what most of those words meant...
[1:15:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Player 2. That's cute
[1:15:18] <rytisone> to pee or not to pee?
[1:15:18] <Graxe_> Well, "canon". In that Yoko Taro way.
[1:15:19] <%QueequegTheater> @StaceMcGate Black 2B
[1:15:20] <%Laecerelius> So Earth became The First?
[1:15:21] <$spleekle> YOKO IS ON CRACKO
[1:15:21] <+kraajkase> thats bullshit
[1:15:22] <%starotter70> I didn't realize it was a sequel
[1:15:23] <%Jhylla81> I wish the Garo gear wasn't going away
[1:15:25] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Yo that's awesome!
[1:15:25] <+NitronStreams> nani the actual fuck
[1:15:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> 2P Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:15:27] <+FennecZephyr> tech issuwes on steam put a damper on iot
[1:15:27] <Dementedpenguin> Sounds about right considering the first Nier game's connections.... NotLikeThis
[1:15:27] <RupanSen> Player 2?
[1:15:28] <%transporterthesequel> No, he means Canon in every sense of the word
[1:15:30] <Nina96> I didnt know that it would be canon
[1:15:34] <RushUnplugged> It's WRITTEN BY YOKO TARO, IT'S CANON AS FUCK
[1:15:35] <+TheRossGamer> whos writing the music for it?
[1:15:35] <$Chimeraelite> That's the best
[1:15:36] <%StaceMcGate> @QueequegTheater Dark Skin 2B is too much for this world to handle
[1:15:37] <%starotter70> Of course he does LUL
[1:15:38] <%gekizenbu> Yoko Taro would be a healer masochist
[1:15:38] <Eternal_Harmony> thats lame
[1:15:39] <@SSaryn> So 2P is now a character that is also canonized as the 2nd color as 2B in Soul Calibur 6.
[1:15:42] <%ShaneWhite> What! your messing around
[1:15:42] <%transporterthesequel> Every single Yoko Taro ending is real
[1:15:44] <Graxe_> Didn't he give up at Titan?
[1:15:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Makes sense since he likes to sprinkle the story in as manner places as possible.
[1:15:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH
[1:15:52] <%FancyHatMan> The adventures of clumbo, Knuckles, and redbull13
[1:15:57] <townzzzzz> 2p low punch
[1:15:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> ITS CANON
[1:16:03] <Charuzu> considering Nier is connected to Drakengard it's not too much of a stretch
[1:16:04] <animalxer> Climb up the thing in the middle
[1:16:05] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat pat that's an exit, not an entrance I believe
[1:16:08] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> I'm looking forward to the raid stream, man.
[1:16:12] <%TimetodiveLTX> same
[1:16:15] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat But do you hear the Raid Music
[1:16:16] <%Big_King_Coconut> what what does the P designation stand for?
[1:16:20] <RupanSen> LONG RANGE MATERIA
[1:16:22] <Ner234> That dragon kinda reminds of the one from Bravely Default
[1:16:24] <+NitronStreams> 2Phat
[1:16:24] <%Jhylla81> long range materia
[1:16:25] <AdmiralButtloaf> long range materia?
[1:16:26] <%DedlokPM> @StaceMcGate 2p is the official name for the dark skin with whitre clothes pallete swap of 2b in soul calibur 6
[1:16:26] <%ssjklyco> Great, the next Final Fantasy is now gonna be made by Yoko taro and FF16 will now be canon with DrakenNier universe.
[1:16:28] <%starotter70> It fucks me up that Heal/Cure are not swapped in this game
[1:16:28] <%StaceMcGate> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhand
[1:16:29] <%QueequegTheater> It stands for phat ass
[1:16:32] <+TheRossGamer> hes not doing big numbers no long range materia?
[1:16:33] <rytisone> Nier Automata Stage Play is also canonical
[1:16:35] <RupanSen> sorry for the caps it was unintntional
[1:16:38] <%transporterthesequel> Oh yeah, 2P is from SOUL CALIBUR, BY THE WAY
[1:16:41] <%Big_King_Coconut> @QueequegTheater ain't no asses in FFXIV
[1:16:43] <Nina96> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:16:45] <RushUnplugged> 2P is the alternate color for 2B in Soul Calibur, and he brought her in 14 and canonized the fan name
[1:16:45] <%Quigsies> YO THAT WAS DOPe
[1:16:49] <ginjais> official mashups
[1:16:51] <$spleekle> MAXIMO MUSICO
[1:16:58] <%zamzoph> FYI, Drakengard/Nier is a multiverse in which EVERY weird divergent spinoff thing is canon
[1:17:02] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat has woolie heard it yet?
[1:17:03] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> @StaceMcGate Hey! Thanks a bunch for the sub, Stace! That's awesome, I appreciate it.
[1:17:03] <+Kango234> That sounds incredible.
[1:17:03] <%QueequegTheater> @Big_King_Coconut you say that like Krile doesn't exist KappaHD
[1:17:07] <zafooru> wait is Final Fantasy in the Drakengard series??
[1:17:10] <$spleekle> I gotta hear that
[1:17:18] <%Big_King_Coconut> @QueequegTheater I stand corrected
[1:17:20] <+wjones0415> no
[1:17:20] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat I think these guys drop an amazing accessory when you steal from them
[1:17:29] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat But will FF14 have a robot orgy?
[1:17:32] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:17:32] <%Meekest> LUL
[1:17:33] <Dementedpenguin> @zafooru Now it is. Kappa
[1:17:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> LORD OVER WOOLIE
[1:17:35] <poweredscoot> Taro told Okabe to put FF music in Nier and he did it, absolute madman

[1:17:41] <Teiwaz12> Is the FFXIV raid a litmus test to see if Yoko Taro is ready to direct FFXVI?
[1:17:42] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Do it! =D
[1:17:42] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie would main a SAM
[1:17:44] <rytisone> The Truest of Endings

[1:17:50] <$spleekle> Woolie starts an account
[1:17:54] <+TheRossGamer> the weapon of redbull
[1:17:58] <%Jhylla81> Nier Dress Sphere
[1:18:03] <+IronPickle> Why would you put Red upfront if he has long range?
[1:18:07] <Ner234> Never use IT
[1:18:08] <%QueequegTheater> Alright now never use it
[1:18:13] <%gespenst25> The Real ending to Nier Automata is the stage play ending B. Kappa
[1:18:15] <%MasterDecoder> NEVER
[1:18:15] <SomersaultJustice> unless it's a magic pot
[1:18:16] <%starotter70> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[1:18:17] <Louie_Salmon> Ever.
[1:18:18] <@CoalSavoie> OH GOD USE IT NOW
[1:18:19] <ginjais> I swear some of this game's screens are so goofy with the hidden paths lol
[1:18:19] <$spleekle> Save it for NG+
[1:18:19] <%Jhylla81> I never use Ethers
[1:18:20] <Nina96> but u have 50!
[1:18:22] <%Ion_Laser> Cause you might need it for later!
[1:18:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> USE IT
[1:18:26] <%Ion_Laser> apatGoblin
[1:18:27] <jerobees> But I only have 87 of them
[1:18:28] <%Big_King_Coconut> the number of elixirs you have at the end of the game is your score
[1:18:29] <poweredscoot> Elixir is fine, never use megaliixirs
[1:18:30] <rytisone> use it right on the following battle
[1:18:33] <Valdorick> WOW! TYPICAL MAN! Making the WOMAN heal
[1:18:35] <%starotter70> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[1:18:40] <%StaceMcGate> So weird watching base game after seeing it modded
[1:18:43] <$spleekle> Use it on Zombos for insta kills
[1:18:45] <@SSaryn> Are Megalixirs in here...? Cause never use those either.
[1:18:45] <%filialpails> heal me with your big muscles
[1:18:47] <%shurtal> SHE gets to hit it from the back
[1:18:51] <%starotter70> @StaceMcGate Right?
[1:18:56] <%QueequegTheater> This is why ATB is trash
[1:18:57] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat didnt you switch there stuff from the last stream?
[1:19:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> two big nothings
[1:19:07] <%QueequegTheater> Just be turn based
[1:19:07] <%ShaneWhite> What’s that noise?
[1:19:11] <ginjais> Tbh the main thing that annoys me about this game is that aside from Aerith's only one limit break heals and it's one of Yuffie's level 1s
[1:19:19] <arkv01> the enemy design after nibelheim is real fuckin creeps
[1:19:22] <+IronPickle> I think If you give Cloud long rage, he'll take back row damage when he covers other party members
[1:19:23] <@SSaryn> JUDGEMENT BOLT BOOOOOOOIS
[1:19:29] <Absurd_Lizard> 😡
[1:19:30] <SomersaultJustice> Raymeow
[1:19:32] <Bigbossman91> Ramuh is correct though
[1:19:33] <Valdorick> You say Rah-mu because its RIGHT
[1:19:35] <%Futurecity10> ? thats how you say it
[1:19:37] <%crimsonharvest> i missed ramuh the first time i think, if thats the one you get in the gold saucer but can miss
[1:19:37] <%ThatOneGameTester> The ultimate Chad thing cloud could do is bang Jenova and set up sephiroth walking in
[1:19:40] <jerobees> Wammu
[1:19:42] <%PauliusMaximus> isnt that how you say it?
[1:19:43] <%shiny_prinny> as much as i love ff7 and chrono trigger, yeah i don't care for atb
[1:19:50] <%PauliusMaximus> how else would you say it
[1:19:56] <%Dingalow> I need to play this again, man
[1:19:59] <%Jhylla81> I hope when Remake comes out they make figures of the characters/summons
[1:19:59] <%Big_King_Coconut> @ginjais doesn't red have one that heals himself? or did you mean party heals?
[1:20:05] <OToole42> man, I loved the music in this
[1:20:09] <%StaceMcGate> ATB works for Chrono Trigger since you have team attacks
[1:20:10] <%gespenst25> Those JoJo dub name changes are getting silly
[1:20:14] <rytisone> man I hope Remake runs at 60fps on ps4 slim
[1:20:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Rah- Muh. Like its spelled
[1:20:19] <$spleekle> Can't wait to hear this track in remake
[1:20:20] <ginjais> @Big_King_Coconut not sure about Red but yes I did mean party heals
[1:20:21] <%QueequegTheater> Man, as trash as FO4's story is, something about maxing out all the upgrades on the guns just tickles my brain in the right way
[1:20:23] <+nichego> @nichego is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[1:20:25] <%StaceMcGate> Vincent Weapon

[1:21:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That was ok.
[1:21:29] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Woah! That was pretty cool.
[1:21:29] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Is there anything you never done in this game? Any materia missed or hidden scene?

[1:21:59] <arkv01> you havent fucked barret
[1:22:00] <%QueequegTheater> Why? The graphics are so trash
[1:22:03] <%Wurmspawn> Do you plan to beat the optional weapons in this run through?
[1:22:06] <%StaceMcGate> I've played it 4 times and never got stealth attack or final attack materia
[1:22:08] <%derekwst3> go WEAST

[1:22:13] <%QueequegTheater> Kapa
[1:22:13] <chocobodundee> Did you date barret?

[1:22:32] <%InugamiTheHound> !uptime
[1:22:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 22m.
[1:22:35] <%zamzoph> wait, what enhanced backgrounds? I heard the real hi-rez assets are lost
[1:22:37] <rytisone> I beat Emerald weapon on about 50 try
[1:22:37] <red_blaster> MAKE PAIGE FIGHT RUBY WEAPON
[1:22:41] <Ner234> EXPOSED
[1:22:42] <%gespenst25> @starotter70 (I was making a joke about Ramuh (Wammu)) but actually probably Killer Queen or King Crimson. Or Changing Oingo and Boingo to Zenyatta Mondatta because that was a DIFFERENT copyrighted thing...
[1:22:42] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat are you planing to fight more "CATS"
[1:22:43] <Absurd_Lizard> EXPOSED
[1:22:45] <+d00msdaydan> used single use items?
[1:22:45] <$spleekle> I came here to watch 45 min of KOTR on weapon! 😡
[1:22:46] <Djinnazz> @angriestpat best Emerald and Ruby with lvl 7 Tifa?
[1:22:47] <%miguelrod777> FAKE FAN
[1:22:48] <%InugamiTheHound> where we now?
[1:22:49] <%starotter70> apatCrazyhead
[1:22:50] <+Theophilus567> Didn’t pat beat mt Nibel in the last stream?
[1:22:51] <ospreyworks> 99???
[1:22:53] <%Quigsies> Pat crazy talked himself!
[1:22:54] <LaughingCatt> You have a goal now
[1:22:54] <%ssjklyco> Resurrected Aeris
[1:22:55] <ospreyworks> Holy shit
[1:22:55] <%Mekhet09> Fraud
[1:22:58] <%SummonerMagno> use a megaelixir??
[1:23:01] <poweredscoot> all you need is beta
[1:23:06] <BigZam> but sniper deathblow
[1:23:07] <jonasislike> You gonna get the gold chocobo?
[1:23:07] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat did you feed elixirs to magic pots, their real canonical use?
[1:23:08] <ospreyworks> How long did that take??
[1:23:09] <Dementedpenguin> @InugamiTheHound actually he just started the actual game about 20-ish minutes ago
[1:23:09] <%SpcOpsBear> It's called Zantetsuken, you cowards
[1:23:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What was Paige's reason for the Ruby Weapon Hour? Big, annoying and easily avoided?
[1:23:15] <%Mekhet09> Trine is really good as well.
[1:23:16] <%InugamiTheHound> okay cool
[1:23:19] <%StaceMcGate> Beta and Aqualung clear 80% of this game
[1:23:20] <+IronPickle> There's an exploit you can do with a late game materia that allows you to duplicate items, so making 99 of everything would be trivial
[1:23:23] <@SSaryn> And now everytime I see Zantetsuken, just reminds me of FFXIII and that makes me sad.
[1:23:24] <corepercentlives> knife only with cloud b
[1:23:24] <arkv01> do it odin, honk honk!!
[1:23:32] <%starotter70> @gespenst25 Yeah, that one's pretty bad
[1:23:32] <frogurtz> That's gonna look cool in the remake
[1:23:36] <BigZam> Also God Hand Deathblow
[1:23:36] <+TheRossGamer> people actually use ethers?
[1:23:37] <+Theophilus567> Musta had a fever dream imagining it lol
[1:23:49] <Thirtine> @zamzoph someone used ai upscaling to improve the original ff9 backgrounds, and they look pretty nice
[1:23:49] <%LiquidShake83> did you date sephiroth?
[1:23:53] <ospreyworks> Really @ironpickle? Never heard about that
[1:23:54] <%Dingalow> Beaten the game with everyone at Level 1!?
[1:23:54] <%starotter70> Pat loves to mash
[1:24:00] <%QueequegTheater> I've heard XIII isn't the problem as much as its sequels. Can I kjust play XIII and get a complete story?
[1:24:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Or use one of those old turbo controllers.
[1:24:06] <%StaceMcGate> Endless customization ability, best strategy is to mass attack @AngriestPat
[1:24:08] <%ChaosAethr> I've Max enemy skill and oh boi some of those skills are not worth it getting
[1:24:11] <+Wrashis> ff7: the original button basher
[1:24:13] <+Theophilus567> Did you date barret at the golden saucer?
[1:24:14] <bleugh> h-haiyai
[1:24:19] <ospreyworks> I tried getting 99 of those items from the train graveyard near the beginning and gave up
[1:24:32] <dredgyboi> do you have materia builds in mind for this runb?
[1:24:32] <Make_me_mad> The first time I played FF7 I somehow missed Vincent completely and spent the whole rest of the game wondering when I got him on the team, and then when I saw the little red wiggly thing in the desert I thought that might be him and rammed it and got murdered by ruby weapon. I was a dumb kid.
[1:24:36] <@SSaryn> FFXIII is fine on its' own but boi is it a fucking trip your first time through
[1:24:39] <OToole42> I recall those guys have a tifa weapon to steal
[1:24:44] <%Big_Dream> yes
[1:24:46] <+Theophilus567> Can’t you steal something from the ball n chain guys?
[1:24:49] <%StaceMcGate> W-Item
[1:24:50] <Valdorick> Save MP? You mean spend all your money on tents and cottages?
[1:24:50] <%AncelDeLambert> you get 99 by CHEATING
[1:24:51] <%nmaten> gameshark
[1:24:56] <$spleekle> W-ITEM Glitch

[1:25:13] <%Big_Dream> i mean the train yard is a legit strat
[1:25:14] <Absurd_Lizard> Double-u-item
[1:25:15] <ospreyworks> I was a dumb 19 year old 10 years ago
[1:25:23] <LaughingCatt> Glitches bitches
[1:25:24] <%nmaten> you said the easy way
[1:25:27] <%InugamiTheHound> gameshark wow I haven't heard that in many years
[1:25:29] <ospreyworks> I didn’t know there was a better way
[1:25:31] <Valdorick> No wait, I'm thinking of Morph
[1:25:45] <%speaks2much> speaks2much subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Pat you're my final fantasy
[1:25:54] <SomersaultJustice> SOMERSAULT
[1:25:57] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat I've just realized Cloud is the only FF protagonist who we know isn't a virgin
[1:26:02] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I've heard XIII isn't the problem as much as its sequels. Can I kjust play XIII and get a complete-ish story?
[1:26:03] <%AncelDeLambert> no, not all the way out. Use one item, select the second item, then cancel the second. It copies the second item
[1:26:04] <%SpcOpsBear> You have to press 'Select' on it first before you back out
[1:26:06] <rytisone> hit 'YEAH' with speed up
[1:26:07] <%ThatOneGameTester> damn that's an easy bug to find
[1:26:12] <ospreyworks> I actually believed the mind goblins were strong enough to make you do that, Pat
[1:26:13] <Dementedpenguin> The only time I used gameshark was to play Saturn imports back in the 90s. Playing JPN Fighting Vipers was glorious.
[1:26:15] <$spleekle> 99 MEGALIXERS TO NEVER USE
[1:26:24] <@SSaryn> I saw Meteodrive and I just wanna play Dissidia 012 now
[1:26:25] <bahamut1010> Somersualt in Remake PogChamp
[1:26:30] <KeiPrime> ff4 had a similar bug for duping
[1:26:35] <KeiPrime> but i think that was for weapons
[1:26:38] <+TheRossGamer> same as ff3
[1:26:38] <%umbypokochan> well dam, that would make farming elixirs to feed the magic pots super easy
[1:26:40] <+TheRossGamer> on the ds
[1:26:43] <+garfgarog> @stacemcgate Cecil isn’t one either
[1:26:46] <LaughingCatt> It was so damn easy to discover
[1:26:48] <BigZam> FF3 DS has the dumbest dupe
[1:26:51] <%shiny_prinny> i'm ready to be a tifa main in the remake
[1:26:55] <BigZam> Loveit so much
[1:27:01] <%ThatOneGameTester> tripple was better
[1:27:03] <%skizzuto> haste is always the best buff in literally every game
[1:27:04] <%le_master_of_le_swords> Take my money par! Take it!
[1:27:04] <bahamut1010> did pat saw the Abs fight?
[1:27:05] <+Wrashis> @QueequegTheater 13 itself is also bad in generaql
[1:27:08] <rytisone> It's time to GO
[1:27:10] <%Big_King_Coconut> the junction system was so busted
[1:27:13] <%InugamiTheHound> double, triple haste or any magic was nice as well
[1:27:14] <+Wrashis> general*
[1:27:15] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat I wanna know your thoughts on the psp Dissidia games
[1:27:18] <%StaceMcGate> @garfgarog nah, Tifa and Cloud banged. Cecil and Rosa could of had a sexless marriage for all we know
[1:27:18] <%QueequegTheater> @Wrashis But pink chick cute tho
[1:27:19] <dredgyboi> so junction was good actually?
[1:27:23] <ospreyworks> I’m planning on replaying this before the remake comes out, so I’ll give it a try
[1:27:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 8 is a good game, but not as good as 9, which wasnt as good as 7
[1:27:27] <rhus> most of what makes 8 fun is how you can bust it
[1:27:30] <$spleekle> Junction was easy to break early one
[1:27:36] <LaughingCatt> Junction was great in some ways & god awful in others
[1:27:38] <%StaceMcGate> There's nothing in the reactor
[1:27:41] <+QuasartheHero> bitterScree
[1:27:41] <DetroitSentai> arcade
[1:27:41] <bahamut1010> YEAH ezaTen ezaTen
[1:27:41] <%le_master_of_le_swords> le_master_of_le_swords subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Take all my money Pat! Take it! Take my dirty money!
[1:27:45] <%ThatOneGameTester> stop was stronger than hasdte too. i loved ff8 fight me lol
[1:27:46] <%Jhylla81> I only played the first one. It was great
[1:27:47] <@SSaryn> And then 3v3.
[1:27:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @QueequegTheater play it on mute. dialogue ain't great
[1:27:52] <%ChaosAethr> Same
[1:27:53] <Teiwaz12> VIII's systems were cool and interesting. It's the story and characters that are trash.
[1:27:54] <bahamut1010> NT IS SHIT
[1:27:55] <%transporterthesequel> 3v3 for god sakes
[1:27:56] <LaughingCatt> then they FUCKED IT UP
[1:27:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Dissida was so good...but the arcade game is so BAD
[1:27:57] <@CoalSavoie> Then they gave Ramza a nose
[1:27:57] <SunsetJack> Yea....
[1:27:58] <%InugamiTheHound> @QueequegTheater I like final fantasy 13 and 13-2 is so much better and that game is amaizng
[1:28:00] <%Dingalow> All I think about when FFVIII is brought up is Spoony. Then I remember Spoony and I feel bad
[1:28:04] <%ChaosAethr> Same Felling
[1:28:05] <%zamzoph> But Tifa tho Kreygasm
[1:28:06] <%averyoddjew> and now i'm sad again
[1:28:06] <@SSaryn> And more DLC keeps coming out for it.
[1:28:08] <%Agami23> they never made one for ps4. they just ported an arcade game over @AngriestPat
[1:28:09] <%ChaosAethr> feeling
[1:28:09] <ginjais> It just isn't what anyone wanted I feel
[1:28:13] <ginjais> I was super duper excited too
[1:28:15] <%ssjklyco> It came out same time as Monster Hunter and DBFIGHTERZ
[1:28:19] <LaughingCatt> THEY TURNED MY DUDE GOLBEZ INTO CRAP
[1:28:21] <+Wrashis> tifa was already in duodecim
[1:28:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> I would pay money to get the PSP versions on console
[1:28:23] <%Kain5707> @AngriestPat hey Pat when is the next stream with Fuggins?
[1:28:26] <+QuasartheHero> @angriestpat that game was dead af on day one and they still pump dlc for it
[1:28:27] <bahamut1010> I which there's was something here
[1:28:27] <+TheRossGamer> VIII is cool but its such a chore to draw 99 of the spells but do it early and you wont have to worry about doing it later
[1:28:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hey, look tifa. its where your dad died
[1:28:30] <%QueequegTheater> Alright I'm getting the most conflicted answers ever.
[1:28:32] <+Wrashis> you can play tifa in a better dissidia game
[1:28:33] <%Jhylla81> Jecht was so fun in Dissidia 1
[1:28:33] <+garfgarog> @stacemcgate Ya except they had a son you play as him in the after years
[1:28:39] <tri3dgE027> They force fed the 3 vs 3, the P2P connection made it worst
[1:28:43] <@SSaryn> Ye
[1:28:44] <ginjais> 1V1, more focus on fights than objectives
[1:28:45] <%ssjklyco> you and Clemps
[1:28:47] <DetroitSentai> Japan arcade 3v3 games, gotta love them
[1:28:47] <%ChaosAethr> With Clems
[1:28:47] <%ShogunNoonto> what game ?
[1:28:48] <Dementedpenguin> Pfft. It's all about that Ehrgeiz. God bless that ring. Kappa
[1:28:51] <+QuasartheHero> u did with clemps
[1:28:52] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat it was you and clemps
[1:28:52] <$spleekle> The long lost LP
[1:28:54] <%InugamiTheHound> you'd think you could find something at heart of sephiroth's breakdown with Zack, Tifa, Sephiroth, Cloud, Angel and Genesis
[1:28:54] <rainwater739> @AngriestPat I mever played a FF game. What are they about?
[1:28:55] <%primax104> clemps yes
[1:28:55] <ginjais> now it's fuckin Free to Play right?
[1:28:56] <ospreyworks> How is cloud not having the hardest, nastiest flashbacks right now??
[1:28:56] <LaughingCatt> 6 person peer to peer matches
[1:28:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Jhylla81 Jecht's combos were godlike
[1:28:57] <%Who_lio42> it looks good...
[1:28:58] <+QuasartheHero> bitterDab
[1:29:00] <bahamut1010> AT LEAST IT GAVE US RAMZA HD
[1:29:02] <+Ririten> The matches itself are fun imho it's just everything around the matches
[1:29:03] <LaughingCatt> its idiotic
[1:29:03] <%SpcOpsBear> was I the only one who absolutely hated the 6999 rule in PSP dissidia
[1:29:05] <Graxe_> Yeah, it was with Clemps
[1:29:05] <DetroitSentai> Which is weird because Gundam Versus 2v2 is the shit
[1:29:06] <GeltonZ> @ShogunNoonto Dissidia PS4
[1:29:14] <%averyoddjew> indeed he is
[1:29:14] <%QueequegTheater> He is
[1:29:15] <%Quigsies> Yup
[1:29:15] <@SSaryn> Sure is.
[1:29:24] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat So in the remake, how will the Jenova boss battles go down? In the original Sephiroth just drops a piece of its body and suddenly monster
[1:29:24] <%Mekhet09> @TheRossGamer You only need to get gf abilities that let you turn things into draw.
[1:29:25] <SomersaultJustice> clemps has been streaming duodecim recently
[1:29:26] <+QuasartheHero> @ginjais nope its a getto trial version
[1:29:31] <ginjais> oh that's great
[1:29:35] <+Wrashis> anyone who played dissidia 1 remember "beneath the light, comes judgement!"
[1:29:35] <$spleekle> No :(
[1:29:40] <@SSaryn> Eyyyy Dissidia 012 is something you could play on an off-season
[1:29:41] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I also bought him Spec Ops. By god, somebody whose content I like is going to play that game
[1:29:42] <jerobees> Yes ;=;
[1:29:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because yu don't want to poison the moment
[1:29:42] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Yeah, =/
[1:29:42] <%Kain5707> yup
[1:29:43] <Aydarkzero> yep!
[1:29:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> yeah
[1:29:45] <%primax104> yeah :(
[1:29:46] <%Quigsies> Adulthood
[1:29:46] <+Wrashis> just keep spamming that one move
[1:29:47] <%umbypokochan> that's how i feel about everyone
[1:29:47] <%DedlokPM> I know that feel doodSad
[1:29:47] <%Mekhet09> @AngriestPat you should put enemy skill on.
[1:29:47] <%ThatOneGameTester> i'm that guy
[1:29:48] <GeltonZ> AWESOME! I didn't play much Dissidia so I look forward to learning more about them. To me, Castlevania Judgement was better but again I played very little Dissidia.
[1:29:49] <missingangle> literally all the time don't attack me like this
[1:29:49] <Absurd_Lizard> :/
[1:29:50] <LaughingCatt> You guys played it after Dynasty Warriors 9 & weren't sure which one felt worse
[1:29:51] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> haha... no
[1:29:52] <%ChaosAethr> If only they kept it the Same
[1:29:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yeah.. Friends. FeelsBadMan
[1:29:55] <+NitronStreams> i dont have friends
[1:29:55] <%ssjklyco> Square Sent that to die. They made it play bad and release it same day as Monster Hunter World and DBZ
[1:29:56] <Teiwaz12> I have no friends
[1:29:56] <+TheRossGamer> @Mekhet09 for real? ive just been drawing like a wiener then
[1:29:57] <%InugamiTheHound> Pat X Mr.Clemps watch out for his foot feitish

[1:31:26] <%Jhylla81> I mean, if this was FF12 I can understand not buffing the 'protag'. Because Vaan sucks
[1:31:30] <%ElenaManetta> Well the tone of your voice is sarcastic but the actions in the game are genuine
[1:31:31] <Absurd_Lizard> he ded in my game. that's not normal? :O

[1:31:55] <worldbrand> Crombo?
[1:31:56] <rytisone> Wheelchair Clumbo still kicking
[1:31:56] <tri3dgE027> @AngriestPat I wanted to look into FFXIV in the PC, but I am confused since apparently there are distribution versions (stand-alone and Steam). Which should I pick?
[1:31:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nonsense, everyone knows you only give Robo the stat buffs
[1:31:57] <%Kain5707> wake up chrono
[1:31:58] <%Dingalow> apatHoldon
[1:31:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> CLOUD NEVER EVER LEAVES THE PARTY
[1:32:00] <%Keyd00d> believe it
[1:32:00] <Hellarussian> i cannot believe it
[1:32:02] <$spleekle> Chrono is Crumbo Cloud is Clumbo
[1:32:02] <+garfgarog> Lucky Clumbo
[1:32:05] <LaughingCatt> Clumtifa
[1:32:05] <worldbrand> blood & wine is great
[1:32:06] <%StaceMcGate> no shit
[1:32:06] <%InugamiTheHound> Cloud was gonna die to same enemy in the flashback LOL
[1:32:07] <krymzen5> its amazing
[1:32:08] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> So that Harddrive article was right.
[1:32:11] <%indig0bird> Garaldo good
[1:32:11] <Absurd_Lizard> Playing games without us? 😡
[1:32:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I need to get on that at SOME point
[1:32:11] <@commanderclaw> Blood & Wine is fucking great
[1:32:15] <Angry_Ev1L> too bad combat sucks
[1:32:16] <%Pappajimbo> it is quite good
[1:32:17] <garbageheaphound> Blood and Wine is amazing
[1:32:17] <dredgyboi> hot takes pat
[1:32:18] <bahamut1010> WHY DIDN'T CLOUD SPEEK ON THE LAST TRAILER??
[1:32:19] <%derekwst3> you should play lost odessy, its a game where you can have a party of grandparents and grandchildren
[1:32:19] <%CJett92> hot takes here
[1:32:21] <+SoleilAstier> yes its great
[1:32:25] <%Dingalow> still need to play that
[1:32:27] <%StaceMcGate> ...Wanna play some Gwent?
[1:32:27] <simulationbard> I still gotta finish Witcher One, but that game is pretty rough around the edges
[1:32:29] <%SomeNEET> Streaming that game as a nobody is lonely, great game tho SeemsGood
[1:32:33] <%umbypokochan> @AngriestPat play Dragon Quest Buidlers 2... you can build a bathroom and they actually poop.. and then you can use the poop to grow grass
[1:32:34] <%Wurmspawn> Just like how there was NEVER EVER a sequel to Chrono Trigger. Except unless you count the spiritual sequel of Xenogears.
[1:32:36] <%PanicSwytch> Would you get it for the switch
[1:32:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's pretty decent, but it has plenty of flaws too
[1:32:43] <%DedlokPM> @Absurd_Lizard Crono died in your game. That is not supposed to happen. Better restart it and keep doing so until he actually survives that point in the game. rooSmug
[1:32:44] <corn_dad> Yeah, lost oddyssey is very good.
[1:32:45] <+Greerhead> You don't get a 4 link for a long time
[1:32:45] <SomersaultJustice> lay flat was such an annoying move, took forever to finish
[1:32:45] <+Bad1uck> @angriestpat Can I play Witcher 3 without playing the first 2?
[1:32:55] <%QueequegTheater> yes
[1:32:58] <corn_dad> LO you can also soft-lock tho
[1:32:58] <LaughingCatt> Yep
[1:32:58] <+TheRossGamer> yea
[1:33:01] <%StaceMcGate> @Bad1uck They barely matter, just watch a 40 min recap
[1:33:02] <DracaenaLeaf> Yes
[1:33:02] <%QueequegTheater> @Bad1uck BIG YES
[1:33:03] <krymzen5> oh yea
[1:33:05] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ye
[1:33:05] <%solidousstream> yes
[1:33:05] <+TheRossGamer> dont need the books either
[1:33:05] <$spleekle> @Bad1uck I did and it was fine
[1:33:05] <%kujofire990> yes
[1:33:06] <bahamut1010> yes
[1:33:06] <+SoleilAstier> yes
[1:33:07] <corn_dad> yes
[1:33:08] <%Keyd00d> no
[1:33:08] <SomersaultJustice> ask switch uers
[1:33:14] <bahamut1010> no
[1:33:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @QueequegTheater Next time. I'm doing Boo Lions and then starting a new file when I know what I'm doing. Just got her to B and waiting for her
[1:33:25] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat also read the books first
[1:33:25] <krymzen5> i'd say play 2 skip 1
[1:33:27] <%derekwst3> @Bad1uck yes, but you need to know the witcher had two wives
[1:33:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That is actually the anticipated way to play it
[1:33:42] <%DedlokPM> even more impactful if you read the novels AND played the games. rooSmug
[1:33:43] <%SpcOpsBear> also the game asks you to make choices for what you would have done in the witcher 1 and 2, and so you kinda need to find out what happened in those games
[1:33:44] <ginjais> but you will never know the whole story anyway cus books so if that's what you're worried about, don't worry about that
[1:33:46] <%solidousstream> like who's this yennifer bitch and do I want to put my dick in her
[1:33:48] <+OkamiDude15> is this a witcher ted talk?
[1:33:49] <Hellarussian> Muh lore
[1:33:55] <%QueequegTheater> @Sphincter_Spelunker You can use renown to buy your professor rank back
[1:33:57] <%ThatOneGameTester> of where geralts dick has been
[1:34:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Witcher 3 actively assumes that you didn't play the other two
[1:34:05] <Asuxley> or just read the original novel
[1:34:06] <%ssjklyco> 1 and 2: you bang wenches.
[1:34:07] <LaughingCatt> Find out who he banged
[1:34:07] <Ner234> @ThatOneGameTester Everywhere
[1:34:10] <+nekodelic> don't forget to watch every single second of the Witcher II credits
[1:34:14] <+garfgarog> Cid and Vincent have names set yet?
[1:34:15] <RushUnplugged> You need to know 1&2 to know why sadly Triss is a terrible person
[1:34:16] <%StaceMcGate> I was mad Saska never showed up
[1:34:16] <rytisone> just look up sex scenes Kappa
[1:34:16] <%QueequegTheater> It's to learn why Yennefer is miles ahead of Trish
[1:34:17] <+TheRossGamer> is any one gonna play witcher on the switch? lol
[1:34:17] <LaughingCatt> Who is Roach
[1:34:17] <corn_dad> Why is Yennefer awful?
[1:34:22] <%umbypokochan> who is talking?
[1:34:23] <+Grayhammatter> of which girls geralt banged
[1:34:25] <bahamut1010> WHO IS CIRI
[1:34:25] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yen is shit
[1:34:27] <$spleekle> What do you think of the Witcher series coming to Netflix?
[1:34:28] <randomness_yo> @AngriestPat But there is in game bios for that.
[1:34:29] <+SoleilAstier> Roach best character
[1:34:30] <Orange_Kake> why is roach
[1:34:31] <poweredscoot> Who Is Best Girl?
[1:34:35] <%solidousstream> and why is gerald putting his dick in all these people
[1:34:35] <%derekwst3> just watch the netflix series
[1:34:35] <%DedlokPM> Siri is the iPhone digital assistant. Everyone knows that
[1:34:36] <%StaceMcGate> Game Trish > Book Trish
[1:34:37] <%FrustratedAF> with no context it was so fucking weird seeing Geralt and Dandelion... friendly. at all.
[1:34:37] <+mgskomododragon> Yenn is bae
[1:34:38] <%filialpails> Siri, who are you?
[1:34:38] <%PanicSwytch> Watch all the sex scenes
[1:34:39] <%Dakuu75> the fact that he knows all those names. whata fanboy
[1:34:40] <LaughingCatt> except he says that by punching Dandelion
[1:34:41] <+TyrVarg> Shani best gril
[1:34:42] <%startstoprepeat> witcher 1 and 2 literally barely mention ciri, you're better off reading the books
[1:34:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> but thats ok
[1:34:45] <+OkamiDude15> roach is best girl
[1:34:48] <$spleekle> All that matters is Roach
[1:34:48] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat should you scrape every POI in witcher 3?
[1:34:48] <ginjais> what Pat just said has completely changed my perception of Geralt in a very good way
[1:34:55] <tri3dgE027> Kappa Who is Gaunter 'o Dimm Kappa
[1:34:59] <%Pappajimbo> thats what geralt sounds like
[1:34:59] <bahamut1010> Aall
[1:35:08] <Hellarussian> Did Triss really Cosby Geralt?
[1:35:09] <+aslfrasle> YES

[1:39:49] <%meltdown547> Witcher 1 is a slightly more presentable Gothic.
[1:39:49] <+SoleilAstier> yes, yes it is
[1:39:49] <%GrandFrance> apatWhat
[1:39:50] <%mh9s> ya not wrong
[1:39:50] <+Kaiserzelcor> Hey I like Witcher 1
[1:39:51] <%Jhylla81> More dragons must die for the sake of fashion
[1:39:54] <Fuji_Apples> I got hooked on witcher 1
[1:39:56] <+Kaiserzelcor> In all of its terribleness
[1:39:57] <%Pappajimbo> love me sex cards and eurojank
[1:40:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> Game feels bad to play on PC
[1:40:00] <+Grayhammatter> witcher 1's combat is FUCKED
[1:40:04] <bahamut1010> it's also complety junk
[1:40:08] <bleugh> i've beaten witcher 2 twice Kappa
[1:40:09] <@commanderclaw> Witcher 1 & 2 are nothing BUT eurojank
[1:40:09] <simulationbard> Yeah but the sex cards tho
[1:40:09] <%Xooler67> it's too jank just skip Witcher 1
[1:40:09] <a_mad_dragon> witcher 1 is maximum eurojank
[1:40:13] <%FancyHatMan> What is pat trying to get now?
[1:40:13] <%thefishofwar> playing cards for hookers in that first Witcher game
[1:40:13] <%StaceMcGate> Everything is fucked about Witcher 1, remember the sex cards?
[1:40:19] <RupanSen> eh
[1:40:30] <%solidousstream> God dammit wanna keep watching but I gotta go cause I gotta get up at 4 so night you guys.
[1:40:31] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat are you sad that original voice for ff7 crew is getting replaced, one game I wanted them to voice and they get replaced
[1:40:32] <+TheRossGamer> if he wants the armlets why he killing instead of stealing?
[1:40:36] <%Meekest> Can't wait to play it on my Switch
[1:40:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> I MEMBER STACE
[1:40:39] <worldbrand> I spent like a full day night cycle fighting a golem. It was stupid. I loved it.
[1:40:41] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat is Letho the coolest and why is he so cool
[1:40:43] <Hellarussian> gotta find those emeralds
[1:40:43] <sakeydo> I¨m more of a filthy casual myself.
[1:40:50] <%Dingalow> Cool Ranch...
[1:40:52] <%QueequegTheater> Man, E1S practice has been kicking my ass
[1:40:57] <bahamut1010> @inugamithehound but they are not a great cast
[1:40:58] <Tucker0603> tbh, didn't care for any of them despite loving rpgs
[1:40:59] <arkv01> knuckles wants heavy petting now
[1:40:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @solidousstream off, night man
[1:41:00] <%Big_King_Coconut> SORT YOUR MATERIA PAT
[1:41:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oof*
[1:41:15] <randomness_yo> @AngriestPat You excited for that Cyberpunk2077? If so, what do you expect from the game.
[1:41:26] <gustavozxd> @Tucker0603 me too, i might give 3 another chance though cause the ps4 version wasn't doing it any favors
[1:41:26] <%StaceMcGate> Look at these spells you'll never use
[1:41:35] <+TheRossGamer> no earth sucks!
[1:41:40] <%InugamiTheHound> @bahamut1010 but IMO they are voice of of the characters for cloud, barret, reno and rude etc..
[1:41:42] <ShichiNoBushi> Earth! Fire!...
[1:41:44] <bahamut1010> will pat stream next Tuesday State of play??
[1:41:48] <Madbearv> I can't believe Pat hates cyberpunk
[1:41:53] <BigManLugan> i cant believe cyberpunk is based off an old dnd campaign
[1:41:55] <%Laecerelius> Using MP?! HERESY!!
[1:41:57] <%shiny_prinny> can't use spells because mp go down
[1:42:00] <%GrandFrance> Kappa ?
[1:42:02] <+cafefunk> Any interest in the Ni No Kuni remaster?
[1:42:07] <%QueequegTheater> number go down
[1:42:09] <@SSaryn> Except your ATB meter Kappa
[1:42:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Resources exist to be used, you goblin!
[1:42:13] <+RayDaug> This isn't SMT, just hit them
[1:42:13] <%Jhylla81> hoard everything!
[1:42:14] <@commanderclaw> Attack costs the most important resource: Your time
[1:42:16] <%Maverick_Kross> Maverick_Kross subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:42:21] <%Bad1uck> Bad1uck subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Thank you for the Witcher info!
[1:42:24] <gustavozxd> @cafefunk wait what i didn't know it was getting remastered PogChamp
[1:42:25] <bahamut1010> @inugamithehound but apparently they will still voice them on outher futur games
[1:42:26] <%Jmann1892> Attack Makes Enemy Number Go Down
[1:42:26] <TomDanksEGOT> @AngriestPat Do you think Ghosts of Tsu is coming out before holiday 2020
[1:42:27] <zafooru> oh my god pat did you just use item??
[1:42:28] <chocobodundee> clumhazard
[1:42:28] <Dragamation> am i missing something about cyberpunk, it looks like a decent game but i dont get the massive hype around it
[1:42:29] <+theshinyhunterdom> @angriestpat I’m playing Astral Chain for the first time any wish I knew then what I knew now tips?
[1:42:30] <Orange_Kake> let the mind goblin s guide you to the light
[1:42:34] <GeltonZ> XD This is why I say the Attack Command is what ruins turn based RPGs. You need MULTIPLE FREE CHOICES for turn based RPGs.
[1:42:34] <Nina96> i like it
[1:42:36] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat i hate how much i agree with your gameplay style
[1:42:37] <+TheRossGamer> FF*
[1:42:39] <+TheRossGamer> 8
[1:42:40] <%skizzuto> probably because it's easier to autopilot the gameplay
[1:42:42] <%Sokumotanaka> cause ff7 is dull :p
[1:42:45] <+IronPickle> Well, if all you're going to do is attack, you should unequip your magic materia. It lowers your strength stat
[1:42:49] <%Jhylla81> I should really play the original Ni No Kuni. I only played a couple hours of it
[1:42:50] <%ssjklyco> This is what Paiges FF4 streams were supposed to be.
[1:42:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> When's Gwent stream
[1:42:52] <+TheNewZealandStory> ni no kuni is a bad game with a battle system that becomes almost unworkable after you get your first party member
[1:42:53] <%hntronium> ye fuggins
[1:42:53] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You should play Tactics again when you have the time. The best story.
[1:42:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> i need to go back into witcher 3
[1:43:01] <valtiel__> @valtiel__ is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:43:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I got ten hours into 2 and just stopped
[1:43:07] <chocobodundee> @GeltonZ have you played BattleChasers Nightwar
[1:43:11] <%JetpackMcQuack> Kill 1, Fuck 2, Marry 3
[1:43:11] <+decisivelynameless> 2 is a fantastic game. Better than 3 if you prefer a more linear story.
[1:43:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> monkaS
[1:43:16] <%InugamiTheHound> @bahamut1010 well that's cool but its gonna be weird hearing everyone have two different voice actors for each character
[1:43:16] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Have you ever played Tactics Advance?
[1:43:17] <zafooru> tru
[1:43:18] <%ElenaManetta> Is that how you get our money?
[1:43:18] <gustavozxd> makes sense
[1:43:19] <%SpcOpsBear> Stream yourself doing gathering / crafting in FF14 you cow- no, don't.
[1:43:19] <%Keyd00d> y-yeah
[1:43:20] <+SilverFaustX> i just beat octopath , 90hours well spend
[1:43:21] <Dementedpenguin> Good.... to know? Oh you mean the game.
[1:43:21] <GeltonZ> @chocobodundee I have not
[1:43:22] <Valdorick> Pat Facts
[1:43:22] <@SSaryn> Feed them some food, and then rob them
[1:43:22] <RoeDeerRootie> I played Witcher 2 before 1 and that was fucking wild
[1:43:23] <KeiPrime> like in general or in the game
[1:43:23] <RushUnplugged> out of context sentence of the night
[1:43:23] <%QueequegTheater> I will only play FF stories if they put it into XIV
[1:43:27] <%Sokumotanaka> that's what mom says
[1:43:31] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat TRISS OR YEN?
[1:43:32] <+Grayhammatter> no way
[1:43:35] <%Klarrann3> @AngriestPat Is that how you stole Paige's heart?
[1:43:38] <%badchoice5> True in game, true in life
[1:43:45] <Bigbossman91> @AngriestPat Any plans on streaming Mass Effect sometime in the future seeing as Paige is never gonna finish ME1?

[1:44:01] <GeltonZ> @chocobodundee I'm excited for Ring Fit Adventure though!
[1:44:02] <ShichiNoBushi> YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!

[1:44:09] <bahamut1010> yeah yeah yaH
[1:44:09] <valtiel__> ok that was pretty hype
[1:44:10] <+Ell1ot> there was a eurojank game you played awhile ago. it reminded me of skyrim and a group of assholes raided your village
[1:44:11] <+TheRossGamer> clumbo almost died again
[1:44:11] <%QueequegTheater> @StaceMcGate kind of
[1:44:12] <+TheRossGamer> weak
[1:44:14] <%GrandFrance> apatDab
[1:44:14] <Dementedpenguin> I mean Knuckles >_>
[1:44:15] <chocobodundee> @GeltonZ It does mana in a great way where there are multiple attacks that generate mana and ones that spend it
[1:44:18] <Valdorick> 5/10, not the train that faries the dead to the afterlife
[1:44:19] <Ner234> Tifa had better suplex a drgon in the remake
[1:44:19] <%Sokumotanaka> How did tifa EVER lose her death battle?
[1:44:20] <%InugamiTheHound> I didn't know pat has already learned metrodrive for tfia
[1:44:22] <%Dakuu75> why is Clumbo taking so much damage in those fights?
[1:44:23] <+IronPickle> Can Tifa suplex a train?
[1:44:30] <%AncelDeLambert> @Sphincter_Spelunker probably not, I don't remember any such thing. I got to the skeleton hilltop with the king and it just lost all momentum to me
[1:44:34] <+TheRossGamer> you can ff6
[1:44:35] <chocobodundee> @GeltonZ I'll have to look that up!
[1:44:37] <OhioNitsud> buh gawd she broke that monster in half!
[1:44:38] <GeltonZ> @chocobodundee NICE! That was exactly the system I was gonna use for my RPG Maker game.
[1:44:40] <%StaceMcGate> wait, can Tifa suplex the Weapons?
[1:44:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pat re-enacting that FIFA video
[1:44:41] <+TheRossGamer> suplex ghost train
[1:44:43] <bahamut1010> pat are you ready for dragon quest day?
[1:44:45] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Why bother playing other FF games when their bosses all end up in XIV anyway
[1:44:50] <%InugamiTheHound> @Dakuu75 fire damage and he also has cover so he take hits forothers
[1:45:06] <%Dakuu75> @InugamiTheHound ah, gotchya~
[1:45:11] <GeltonZ> @chocobodundee It's a turn based exercise RPG for Switch. You physically do exercises to do different attacks and fight a bodybuilding dragon.
[1:45:17] <DetroitSentai> Because they'll never put Black Waltzes in other games @QueequegTheater

[1:46:07] <%QueequegTheater> @DetroitSentai But they put the black dwarf race in Shadowbringers already
[1:46:09] <Teiwaz12> But in Japan they read right to left
[1:46:09] <+SoleilAstier> @AngriestPat Finally got my friend to play DS1 and the lucky bastard had the Taurus demon fall off the wall first try. Needless to say to went to his head so I’m waiting for when he hits his wall.
[1:46:16] <arkv01> is it a sex thing?
[1:46:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> but why though
[1:46:17] <%QueequegTheater> @bahamut1010 Pat has OCD

[1:48:02] <gustavozxd> theme of weird bullshit - Final fantasy VII
[1:48:03] <biosurk> :0

[1:48:21] <%StaceMcGate> GUNS
[1:48:26] <bahamut1010> @gustavozxd yep
[1:48:26] <+Ell1ot> i remember that story. it made me sad
[1:48:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> End of disc one my ass, that's like....multiple whole areas from here
[1:48:30] <Ner234> G U N
[1:48:30] <+RayDaug> Is Cid just the guy from Star Trek: First Contact?
[1:48:34] <%Ion_Laser> GUN
[1:48:37] <Ultimatefool> GUN = MAN
[1:48:37] <+Ya_boi_wally > THE GUN IS THE BONOS
[1:48:38] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[1:48:38] <+TheRossGamer> yes youve been told!
[1:48:38] <zafooru> well
[1:48:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> We told you pat
[1:48:39] <%skizzuto> LUL time wasted
[1:48:40] <ergheisu> WELCOME TO THE REAL MAN'S WEAPON
[1:48:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> I think there's some NPC you talk to that gives you a weapon
[1:48:41] <%shiny_prinny> LUL
[1:48:41] <arkv01> did we suck vincent off?
[1:48:42] <%invisi_bliss> AHHH
[1:48:44] <%InugamiTheHound> so what are we gonna name cid in this stream?
[1:48:44] <%CherrieVelvet> but money didn't go down!
[1:48:45] <%Laecerelius> We told you, dawg!
[1:48:46] <GeltonZ> @RayDaug YES. EXACTLY.
[1:48:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Saved money though
[1:48:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> well, we are out in the boonies
[1:48:49] <+Ell1ot> doesn't Dr. Acula need a GUN?
[1:48:52] <%StaceMcGate> Rocket Town = South Carolina
[1:49:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Money to use on other goods and services.
[1:49:02] <+Ya_boi_wally > if dracula had a gun, he'd be unstoppable
[1:49:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Wouldn't really say Vincent is a man, though.
[1:49:06] <+IronPickle> I guess Barett and Vincent are the only men in Cloud's party
[1:49:07] <%Keyd00d> Welcome to the True Man's Weapon
[1:49:08] <+wjones0415> so how come he has nothing for barret?
[1:49:11] <%Jhylla81> I am looking forward to when the remake gets to Cid. I hope he's voiced by Peter Capaldi (I know he won't)
[1:49:13] <+RayDaug> @GeltonZ Which came first though?
[1:49:16] <%NeroInfinite> I have the power of GOD IN MYHANDS -pulls out revolver-
[1:49:17] <Ner234> TIHS
[1:49:18] <+Ya_boi_wally > thir

[1:49:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Ya_boi_wally Hellsing, yes
[1:49:21] <OToole42> its such a populated world, you'd think cloud would provide more of a description. "Cloak black..."
[1:49:22] <%Keyd00d> THIR
[1:49:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Thur
[1:49:25] <bahamut1010> thir
[1:49:26] <Hellarussian> he developed a lisp
[1:49:28] <%Ion_Laser> THUR
[1:49:28] <+Wrashis> i wonder what cid will be named
[1:49:30] <arkv01> rocket towns pretty nice
[1:49:36] <%StaceMcGate> @Jhylla81 Cid is totally a Southern tho, not an angry scotsman
[1:49:37] <ergheisu> "silver hair" would be alot easier right
[1:49:37] <poweredscoot> Looking for thome thailors?
[1:49:41] <%InugamiTheHound> this same music for the wall market right?
[1:49:48] <Ner234> Just name Cid %$&#
[1:49:48] <+HaunchPaunch> What do you think about Apple Arcade, looks dumb right?
[1:49:51] <bahamut1010> @inugamithehound yeah
[1:49:51] <OToole42> @ergheisu I know eh?
[1:49:53] <%SpcOpsBear> What... What happened to your Tomestone phone cover, Pat?!
[1:49:54] <+TheRossGamer> yea
[1:50:16] <+Ya_boi_wally > @Sphincter_Spelunker I was more imagining bram stoker's dracula with a glock
[1:50:17] <%QueequegTheater> The goblins didn't like it
[1:50:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is the "quiet slum" music
[1:50:20] <%zamzoph> How's it feeeeeeeel, Pat?
[1:50:23] <+bennc60> the nostalgia
[1:50:24] <%InugamiTheHound> @bahamut1010 I've seen Cid has guy with heavy boston accent
[1:50:30] <GeltonZ> @RayDaug Huh. Star Trek First Contact was 1996 so I think it did come first.
[1:50:32] <%Jhylla81> I need to get a new phone cover. My Jetman one is cracking like crazy
[1:50:33] <+HaunchPaunch> Man, Pat is really feeling himself right now.
[1:50:33] <aarondight> how many people in the world of ff7 have lost a hand to warrant an entire market for arm guns
[1:50:45] <+TheRossGamer> what is exit magic?
[1:50:47] <ShichiNoBushi> And they never took it down as a monument to their shame.
[1:50:48] <bahamut1010> @inugamithehound what will pat name him??
[1:50:50] <%Klarrann3> was that an apollo 13 reference?
[1:50:52] <+TheRossGamer> is it escape rope?
[1:50:52] <Death_by_moogle> I wanna play with Tifas orthopedic underwear~! :3c
[1:50:53] <ergheisu> you'd be surprised, when there's monster houses just walking around
[1:50:54] <%StaceMcGate> Exit is trash
[1:50:57] <%axellogic> Shitake and salmon on rice with jalapeno sauce
[1:50:59] <+Ell1ot> renaming Aerith to Assfordays gives her limit break, Healing Wind, new meaning
[1:50:59] <ergheisu> everyone needs arms
[1:51:08] <%axellogic> Its delicious
[1:51:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> So clouds never been here despite it being down the road from nibelheim?
[1:51:10] <arkv01> so that last vacant spot is for sephy to join the party yeah?
[1:51:13] <chocobodundee> Shinra doesnt have good OSHA regulations
[1:51:16] <%Mekhet09> Time is really good.
[1:51:32] <Hellarussian> gotta find those emeralds
[1:51:34] <ergheisu> I've never been to Fort Worth despite living in Dallas, so it's fair
[1:51:36] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Classics
[1:51:38] <%Mekhet09> Haste is a nice speed up.
[1:51:38] <bahamut1010> @fruit_pie_the_magician yeah video game logic ;)
[1:51:39] <%InugamiTheHound> @bahamut1010 yeah same here. Got any ideas, chat???
[1:51:39] <%SpcOpsBear> If Protect is so good, why did they take it out of FF14?
[1:51:45] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat How dare you get me back into FO4.
[1:51:45] <%SpcOpsBear> hahahaha
[1:51:47] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat put all those permanent stats ups on aerith she never leaves the party
[1:51:48] <%Mekhet09> because it was too good.
[1:51:49] <corn_dad> I miss protect
[1:51:51] <%StaceMcGate> You only need Enemy Skill and Status Buff materia
[1:51:52] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> gee, if only you had something that did Wall and Barrier at the same time. Some kind of MIGHTY GUARD?
[1:51:53] <%Mekhet09> Like stone skin.
[1:51:57] <%QueequegTheater> The modding system pleases my lizard brain
[1:52:05] <gustavozxd> I just got an amazingly obvious twitch virus link, telling me i'm missing out on not using cards from <link> LUL
[1:52:10] <LandOfTheWay> gee, it sure is boring around here...
[1:52:10] <%ThatOneGameTester> Any of you heard of that study that reversed aging on 9 people? we might be moving towards a future of longer lives.
[1:52:11] <%Keyd00d> Nothing exciting happens around here
[1:52:12] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> toilet
[1:52:13] <ergheisu> those two need to fuck
[1:52:14] <%Dakuu75> I could rob you... that'd be exciting
[1:52:21] <%Mekhet09> Though you could say fuck barrier and get mighty guard.
[1:52:23] <%Big_Dream> Fast travel mods
[1:52:23] <+bennc60> Pull out a gun= not boring
[1:52:27] <+mgskomododragon> man and a woman in the same house both bored. hmmmm
[1:52:31] <%nmaten> big titty mod
[1:52:34] <%StaceMcGate> Coward!
[1:52:35] <dredgyboi> gotta get the sexy yennefer mod
[1:52:44] <Hellarussian> the VVitcher 3
[1:52:48] <arkv01> oily
[1:52:51] <%Deano8817> realistic geralt dong mod or riot
[1:52:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is there a mod to make yen less of a cunt
[1:52:56] <+HaunchPaunch> Nostalgia is hitting really hard right now.
[1:53:00] <DetroitSentai> that third one seems really good
[1:53:02] <%TimetodiveLTX> apply oils to your controller based on the enemy you're fighting
[1:53:05] <Bigbossman91> fast travel from anywhere is real good
[1:53:08] <%QueequegTheater> @Sphincter_Spelunker Yes, it's called reading the books
[1:53:09] <gustavozxd> merchants are poor man
[1:53:11] <%mayorrev> epic meme
[1:53:18] <randomness_yo> @AngriestPat hah, you dont need oil to win a fight. You just slash away until the monsters drop dead at your feet.
[1:53:26] <Teaka> I wonder if thats as intended tho?
[1:53:36] <Teaka> Would having more mun break the game at all?
[1:53:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @QueequegTheater I don't play video games to read source material DansGame
[1:53:38] <%mayorrev> are there Witcher 3 titty mods? asking for a friend
[1:53:39] <RushUnplugged> learn to love Yennefer's tsundere vibe and you'll have the best of times
[1:53:40] <%Big_Dream> you dont need oil you just spin to win
[1:53:42] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Can we get that in a list
[1:53:42] <sakeydo> Do the mods work on PS4?
[1:53:43] <+HaunchPaunch> Pat is in his element.
[1:53:44] <bahamut1010> chill game
[1:53:50] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> >Anti-Goblinoid Oil apatGoblin
[1:53:51] <%StaceMcGate> This makes the Pat happy
[1:54:01] <Bigbossman91> Nope no mods on PS4
[1:54:05] <OhioNitsud> theres a mod where instead of fighting monsters with swords you play gwent to beat them
[1:54:06] <narusao> i wonder if pat could play this game blindfolded
[1:54:13] <arkv01> i almost get a boner from a the good 1997 vibes
[1:54:14] <ergheisu> God I miss drawn backgrounds so much
[1:54:15] <Bigbossman91> PC only
[1:54:15] <%skizzuto> it's cozy is what it is
[1:54:16] <@SSaryn> I feel that's replaying P4G for me
[1:54:17] <rytisone> I should build this in my backyard too
[1:54:19] <bahamut1010> incoming best music
[1:54:22] <+Grayhammatter> a nice spaghoot
[1:54:23] <%Keyd00d> lotsa spaghetti
[1:54:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> its like a movie you have seen a million times
[1:54:23] <%mayorrev> Mom's spaghetti
[1:54:24] <%SpcOpsBear> It's comfort food in digital form
[1:54:24] <+mgskomododragon> Ragu?
[1:54:25] <%walternatorz> sad spaghetti?
[1:54:25] <Hellarussian> im excite
[1:54:27] <%shiny_prinny> mom's spaghetti
[1:54:29] <Teiwaz12> My mom's spaghetti is terrible though
[1:54:29] <rainwater739> "Comfort game"
[1:54:32] <bleugh> eminem's mom?
[1:54:32] <%filialpails> comfy
[1:54:33] <narusao> My Mother was a Saint!
[1:54:34] <%Keyd00d> there's vomit on my sweater already
[1:54:35] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Palms are sweaty
[1:54:37] <KeiPrime> palms sweaty
[1:54:37] <%QueequegTheater> @Sphincter_Spelunker Fair but the fact is that Yenn is 100% justified in being a bitch to both Trish and Jerry
[1:54:37] <+HaunchPaunch> Ratatouille!
[1:54:38] <%mh9s> sad sketti
[1:54:38] <%StaceMcGate> Cid's theme Kreygasm
[1:54:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> My mom made shit spaghetti. I hated spaghetti until I made it myself.
[1:54:42] <%mayorrev> HE SAID IT
[1:54:43] <LandOfTheWay> @AngriestPat any interest in the BBTAG character announcement at 1:00 AM?
[1:54:43] <%brandanvh> No, I don't know about that.
[1:54:44] <%corepool> palms are sweaty
[1:54:45] <gustavozxd> I have that exact situation actually
[1:54:45] <bahamut1010> hahahaha
[1:54:48] <ergheisu> just give me an entire 3D RPG of drawn backgrounds in 2019 please
[1:54:48] <%ThatOneGameTester> My mom burnt water
[1:54:49] <%Wurmspawn> Like being able to fit into a favorite suit you used to wear for special occasions?
[1:54:49] <Captain_Joe1911> pastaThat heart2Kkigomm heart2Heart2
[1:54:50] <%mayorrev> knees weak
[1:54:51] <%SpcOpsBear> My mom's spaghetti was just Kraft Mac & Cheese.
[1:54:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> My mah's Porkchops or Sweet and sour chicken
[1:54:52] <IndoorSitup> More like dad's special sauce Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:54:53] <%mayorrev> arms are heavy
[1:54:53] <+RueOrin> How do you fuck up spaghetti?
[1:54:54] <+theshinyhunterdom> Then mom dies and you never have it again
[1:54:54] <%Dynamoheart> Uh oh, now your knees are weak and your arms are heavy.
[1:54:54] <+bennc60> Is it on your sweater though?
[1:55:03] <randomness_yo> @AngriestPat Why not play the modded version of FF7 like Max and have things just be not what you remember?
[1:55:04] <Namboto> I ate a really bad bowl of spaghetti when I was 6 and I haven't liked spaghetti all that much since
[1:55:04] <+DeaconBluesClues> my mom made great aphgetti you all are deprived children
[1:55:04] <Valdorick> My mom made too much speghetti, to the point that I now hate it.
[1:55:08] <%BappoSama> I love this song.
[1:55:10] <%BappoSama> It's so good.
[1:55:11] <%SpcOpsBear> She made delicious scrambled eggs, though
[1:55:11] <%PanicSwytch> But are your palm sweaty
[1:55:13] <%TimetodiveLTX> spaghetti. spaghetti. spaghetti.
[1:55:21] <%SpcOpsBear> It's too bad I never learned how to make them her way before she died
[1:55:22] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat talk to the abused housewife first
[1:55:22] <%ThatOneGameTester> she was honestly a terrible cook and i learned to cook and feed myself at 5
[1:55:24] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Because of this conversation I just went to rewatch "The Last Wish: Rejection". lol so good
[1:55:25] <OToole42> I actually got fond memories of playing this game with my brother, both of us chowing down on moms spaghetti
[1:55:26] <arkv01> wait a sec.. hoes mad
[1:55:28] <OhioNitsud> you can fuck up spaghetti by cooking the meat with the sauce
[1:55:38] <Djinnazz> PERFECTLY calibrated.
[1:55:39] <gustavozxd> that's bizarre
[1:55:40] <%ssjklyco> The Switch version is technically a modded version with the speed up
[1:55:41] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat 100% I agree with you. That's how I feel when my mom makes her special spaghetti (Burmese sauce )
[1:55:42] <+HaunchPaunch> Hey Pat, have you fired up BL3 yet? Anygood?
[1:55:43] <+DeaconBluesClues> @OhioNitsud explain
[1:55:50] <%zamzoph> wow FF7 must be really graphically intensive Kappa
[1:55:50] <%rasterman> modding this game is a nightmare
[1:55:53] <%Conyst> eata some spaghetti to forgeta your regretti
[1:56:01] <KoltonSaurus> Do mods exist for real life?
[1:56:01] <+Someitalian123> I hadit working on my laptop, but then a windows 10 updated fucked it up
[1:56:02] <Lotharman> Max took 8 hours to get those mods working, it is insane
[1:56:05] <%Keyd00d> BL3 LUL
[1:56:08] <%CherrieVelvet> i never played past materia keeper so this is all new to me CorgiDerp
[1:56:08] <%StaceMcGate> Gib Randy money @AngriestPat
[1:56:10] <Valdorick> BL3 is anti-pat bait. Its Pat Repellant.
[1:56:14] <+Ell1ot> those updated models in Max's version look weird when they do their lego animations
[1:56:16] <bahamut1010> @zamzoph 1997 RTX
[1:56:18] <%Jhylla81> Yup
[1:56:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @QueequegTheater Oh, I don't like Triss either. Everything just feels shallow with her after 2. I mean just in general with anyone helping her trying to find Ciri and both Yenn and Geralt are asking questions to the same person
[1:56:22] <+buttdirt> i mean, it still looks great
[1:56:23] <%nmaten> pirate it
[1:56:25] <rytisone> play on pc and lose your saves
[1:56:26] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat no, INTENSIVE. Making a joke about your difficulty to play the PC version
[1:56:29] <+DeaconBluesClues> @AngriestPat your mileage may vary but borderlands just seems incredibly boring on a conceptual level. why do people like those games?
[1:56:35] <+ckangaroo15k> I've heard mediocre things about BL3
[1:56:37] <%MasterDecoder> Runs fine for me
[1:56:38] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> wait for updates
[1:56:38] <arkv01> bl3 is a garbo
[1:56:41] <SomersaultJustice> how can you not support friend of the show randy pitchford? Kappa
[1:56:42] <%Jhylla81> The jump from ff6 to ff7 was insane back in the day
[1:56:45] <%Mekhet09> BL3 has a load of issues.
[1:56:49] <%PauliusMaximus> skill up's video is really good
[1:56:50] <OhioNitsud> @DeaconBluesClues instead of keeping the meat and the sauce separate you cook it together so its just meat on top of the noodles. no sauce at all
[1:56:52] <+Grayhammatter> BL3 is poorly optimized
[1:56:55] <ExpressNode> I remember my PS1 and N64 being mind blowing back then. Boy they're shit now (in graphics)
[1:56:57] <%mayorrev> How's the console version? @AngriestPat
[1:56:58] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Alright, speaking of relaxing with favorite games, I'm gonna go play Dark Souls 2 Scholar. As always Lucatiel > Solaire, Vendrick > Gwyn. Also, they literally erased all of Tiny Tina's character development from BL2 and her DLC, her intro in 3 is almost shot-for-shot the same as her intro in 2
[1:56:59] <%Fynale> @AngriestPat i mean division 2 put out a patch that makes the game crash on an SLI set up
[1:57:00] <arkv01> thats fucked up
[1:57:00] <%Dakuu75> dafuq, lol
[1:57:00] <%InugamiTheHound> you are missing the house at top of the town
[1:57:01] <%chiluzza> BL3 is rough
[1:57:01] <Mogel56> Borderlands 2 with mods staves off the 3 thrist
[1:57:03] <%CherrieVelvet> oof
[1:57:03] <%chiluzza> fun but rough
[1:57:06] <%ChaosAethr> Yes
[1:57:06] <%chiluzza> chiluzza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[1:57:07] <%shiny_prinny> talk to shera first?
[1:57:07] <%velemi> yes
[1:57:08] <%Mekhet09> jesus
[1:57:09] <gustavozxd> yes
[1:57:10] <%grayjammer> Yeah
[1:57:11] <KoltonSaurus> I can't even get mine to start.
[1:57:11] <%skizzuto> yes, but the game has nothing to do with that
[1:57:13] <bahamut1010> @jhylla81 the jump from 7 to 8 was also crazy
[1:57:13] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat i just beat it today, it was fine, eden 6 was the worst planet with some lag.
[1:57:14] <+HaunchPaunch> I heard it was a problem with DX12
[1:57:16] <VioletRosefall> top house
[1:57:16] <%shiny_prinny> house closest to rocket?
[1:57:18] <+ZoopZoops> Randy Pitchford is my favorite dirt bad
[1:57:18] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat You can go into his backyard yeah?
[1:57:19] <supuhmagikarp> you have to go to Cids house first
[1:57:22] <+bennc60> Can confirm optimization problems
[1:57:24] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> you are crazy but...
[1:57:26] <%axellogic> The gold saucer
[1:57:26] <supuhmagikarp> then go the his backyard
[1:57:27] <%ThatOneGameTester> So fun fact: I originally wanted to rent this game from block buster as a kid but the clerk had mistake FF VIII as FFVII so i played 8 instead of 7 as my first final fantasy
[1:57:27] <%Dakuu75> in a world where my 1080 can run something better than a 2080
[1:57:28] <bahamut1010> go to Cid house
[1:57:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Roland died for nothing then? @QueequegTheater
[1:57:33] <%Koosahmii> And yah know, the whole thing with the goons...
[1:57:39] <ExpressNode> I only dabbled in BL2 but I haven't touched the others. Also I never hear anyone talk about BL1
[1:57:39] <%PlainSimpleTailor> As someone with a 960 that sounds dumb
[1:57:41] <arkv01> shes making the goddamn tea pat
[1:57:46] <%Jhylla81> @bahamut1010 Agreed. Which is why I could not get into 9. It felt like a downgrade
[1:57:48] <+IronPickle> So, if Shinra from FFX-2 colonized the world with space age technology and his direct decedents still use his name, then why is the tech level in FF7 at around the 1950s?
[1:57:49] <%StaceMcGate> IT'S A BOAT
[1:57:52] <Valdorick> Hey Plane that only acts as a boat for some reason!

[2:05:52] <Orange_Kake> damn maybe we should have named him fuckface what a dick
[2:05:53] <supuhmagikarp> they have no romantic relationship though. Cid is just an ass
[2:05:57] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat This makes Kingdom Hearts Cid hilarious
[2:05:58] <Namboto> it would be better if cid actually died here and shera was the party member

[2:07:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> She knew what she was doing. I say let her burn.
[2:07:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> MY DREAMS
[2:07:54] <poweredscoot> Supposedly Cid is supposed to talk like a yakuza, gruff and abrasive. this was translated as abusive.
[2:07:56] <%Dakuu75> THERE'S NO PUSS TO SMASH IN SPACE
[2:07:57] <bahamut1010> OH NOOOOOOOO
[2:07:59] <%Keyd00d> SH-------
[2:07:59] <+Someitalian123> Cid is a gamergater
[2:08:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Yeah, this is about the Challenger, in case anyone was curious
[2:08:01] <Valdorick> See, Pat just doesn't want to admit how close to Cid he is by calling him Fuckface
[2:08:03] <simulationbard> Remember there are no laws in space Kappa
[2:08:03] <bearrier_> but tank number 8 was weird and has this junction system that confuses everyone Kappa
[2:08:06] <%Jrocy247> WHOOPS
[2:08:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> And then she died
[2:08:08] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[2:08:08] <%starotter70> Yeah, makes no sense
[2:08:09] <%ChaosAethr> Yes
[2:08:10] <%AmericanaRed> "CANCELLED"
[2:08:10] <%SomeNEET> lift off = bitch ded
[2:08:10] <Hellarussian> no shut up tho
[2:08:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> WUT
[2:08:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> And probably him also.
[2:08:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat this is totally about The Challenger explosion
[2:08:14] <+wjones0415> so, he's an abusive POS and she is a suicidal moron!
[2:08:15] <missingangle> don't worry bout it
[2:08:16] <%Keyd00d> she's tough
[2:08:16] <%joylent_blue> nah she's fine tho
[2:08:17] <%Jhylla81> Yup. Just dead.
[2:08:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> THIS DOESNT MAKE SENSE
[2:08:18] <arkv01> uh she should be ded lawl
[2:08:18] <%zamzoph> This should've Kerbal exploded
[2:08:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> Should have kilt em all
[2:08:19] <bahamut1010> SHE'S FINE
[2:08:19] <Dementedpenguin> This is a fantasy, Pat. Kappa
[2:08:21] <randomness_yo> That rocket should have exploded
[2:08:23] <%brandanvh> @AngriestPat I wonder if cid is handled better in the original script
[2:08:24] <Valdorick> Acts abusive, but they really love eachother. Pat wants to go to the moon, but doesn't.
[2:08:25] <%WhereIsWill> dr manhattan stayle
[2:08:25] <%badchoice5> She should be so lucky
[2:08:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> BITCH SHOULD BE ASH
[2:08:26] <a_mad_dragon> how did it NOT FINISH FALLING
[2:08:27] <%SomeNEET> She parried
[2:08:28] <%Keyd00d> she's toughened up from all the beatings!
[2:08:28] <%JetpackMcQuack> There are a fwe holes it this
[2:08:29] <poweredscoot> fantasy based on reality
[2:08:29] <%AmericanaRed> apatBig apatWrong
[2:08:29] <+Chewygamer> thats real footage of space X first launch
[2:08:30] <%derekwst3> but she has main character abilities
[2:08:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How did it not explode and destroy everyone?
[2:08:33] <missingangle> i can't believe it's stuck like that
[2:08:33] <%Kashi_Nin> Kashi_Nin subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 33 month streak! heeeeey my favorite track in the game! What a good time to show up! (cid's theme)
[2:08:34] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Yeah she should have been extra crispy but video games.
[2:08:34] <%ssjklyco> She TANKED his dream.
[2:08:37] <%skizzuto> this gives me a whole new perspective on Kingdom Hearts Cid
[2:08:37] <%Sokumotanaka> should have did the same to those trees too
[2:08:37] <gustavozxd> and thaaaaat's wha happun
[2:08:40] <BaronVonMagpie> that would have probably killed everyone in the area
[2:08:40] <%ElenaManetta> it's a world with MAGIC
[2:08:40] <%Jrocy247> I like how it LEANS....That's it....It doesn't actually fall
[2:08:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat the Entire OXYGEN TANKS NEXT TO THE IGNITION thing should have killed them all
[2:08:42] <+bennc60> Immediate vaporization alla Terminator 2
[2:08:44] <Valdorick> Its fine, its a Martia powered rocket
[2:08:47] <%AncelDeLambert> 100% about how the Challenger shouldn't have launched
[2:08:49] <%StaceMcGate> IT'S MY FAULT
[2:08:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But theres not fire AROUND the oxygen tanks
[2:08:50] <%TimetodiveLTX> nice parry on the rocket blast, i can never tell when the hitbox starts
[2:08:52] <BaronVonMagpie> including cid
[2:08:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Japan
[2:08:53] <%AmericanaRed> SAVED MY LIFE
[2:08:53] <+Caped_Eggy> LUL
[2:08:55] <poweredscoot> now she's just working for free, like a slave
[2:08:56] <bahamut1010> yeah
[2:08:57] <+Someitalian123> it's not great
[2:08:57] <%zamzoph> break it down SourPls
[2:08:58] <+wjones0415> it totally is
[2:08:58] <ShichiNoBushi> So you and Paige?
[2:09:00] <supuhmagikarp> they have no realtionship
[2:09:02] <arkv01> after that the fucked like bunnies
[2:09:05] <%AncelDeLambert> yep. It is. That's why it being resolved later on is important
[2:09:06] <animalxer> At least it gets better
[2:09:06] <%Keyd00d> like Tom and Jerry
[2:09:08] <Valdorick> They're both Deathseekers, looking for a rock to die on before the other. Its like Death Chicken.
[2:09:09] <frogurtz> He gets better Pat.
[2:09:13] <gustavozxd> he treated her like shit even before her fuck up though
[2:09:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> THEY MUST FUCK LIKE CRAZY
[2:09:17] <%spacehouse> They're in some KINKY ASS SHIT
[2:09:23] <deltakuma009> yes just pat and paige
[2:09:23] <bahamut1010> I wonder how they will handle this on the Remake
[2:09:24] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat Hoes Sad (x24)
[2:09:32] <%MuffledEurobeat> I guess it makes sense the launch failed if the structure was overdesigned by that much Kappa
[2:09:35] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Both of these people are fucking idiots
[2:09:35] <%starotter70> BUT SPACE
[2:09:42] <%ssjklyco> Why did she have to check it DURING the launch and not an HOUR before?
[2:09:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Cid's life has no meaning without space, which is important
[2:09:45] <+HaunchPaunch> Greatest game ever right!
[2:09:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What's one life worth
[2:09:50] <doggieo> ITS HIS LIFE DREAM
[2:09:51] <simulationbard> But his dream tho, Think BOUT HIS DREAM
[2:09:51] <%zamzoph> life is cheap in FF7 land
[2:09:52] <%Quigsies> Cid did nothing wrong Kappa
[2:09:55] <%AmericanaRed> the dream tho BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:09:57] <$dmdyne99> Cid is the opposite of Paige
[2:09:57] <%supersugoisenpai1> Go to space and turn Shera into a skeleton
[2:09:58] <%Keyd00d> but drama
[2:09:58] <%Emperor_Machinus> but dream though
[2:10:00] <%TimetodiveLTX> Hoes Dumb (x24)
[2:10:02] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat but he's cool tho
[2:10:02] <%ElenaManetta> Hey man, it was realistic when it happened to other NASA missions
[2:10:03] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat Like you wouldn't consider sacrificing Paige.
[2:10:03] <+Caped_Eggy> Yea but what if his dream is to save a million people pat?
[2:10:07] <%WhereIsWill> not stop it at the LAST SECOND
[2:10:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> But dreqm of Killing tho
[2:10:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> We kill people to keep the lights on me
[2:10:11] <Valdorick> But Pat! He just wanted to go to the moon! The perfect socity!
[2:10:12] <ginjais> it's crazy that they couldn't delay it by literal minutes
[2:10:12] <poweredscoot> hey man we gotta pour that dam, we can't stop just cause someone fell in
[2:10:14] <%Jhylla81> The fact that its moreso he doesnt wanna be a murderer and not to save her life in particular is insane
[2:10:14] <bahamut1010> PALMER
[2:10:14] <%AncelDeLambert> I think the implication is that Cid was desperate to cling to the hope that she would clear the launch zone in time
[2:10:15] <rytisone> goddamn it woman ***
[2:10:15] <+nekodelic> I wonder how will they deal with this arc in the remake LUL
[2:10:15] <TomDanksEGOT> i mean you kill tons of people in this game
[2:10:16] <%starotter70> Why didn't they just wait to check the tanks
[2:10:17] <+wjones0415> DRINK YOU GODDAMN TEA!!
[2:10:19] <%AmericanaRed> CID MUSK
[2:10:20] <%StaceMcGate> BODY SHAME

[2:10:31] <Dementedpenguin> Hey Palmer.... don't mind this talking dog/cat/thing Kappa
[2:10:32] <Valdorick> ... I just realized how much of a fetish Final Fantasy has for the Moon... wow...
[2:10:33] <%Dakuu75> yeah, that's how you talk to your boss "HEY FAT MAN"
[2:10:33] <frogurtz> "Sit down and drink your goddamn tea!", better be in the remake!

[2:11:31] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat Feels went and played the fan translation of this, he says that "lard" was totally in the original Japanese
[2:11:32] <+IronPickle> As someone who didn't drink tea when I originally played this, I thought lard a normal thing to put in tea
[2:11:32] <%brandanvh> Why the fuck don't they just use the highwind

[2:19:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The hokage gets nerfed in Bort
[2:19:24] <%ssjklyco> So are a lot of actors

[2:20:43] <%InugamiTheHound> red13 wants to fuck Yuffie now as "revenge fuck" LOL
[2:20:47] <Murphio_GS> *flashbacks to WOW BFA*

[2:20:55] <+Ell1ot> Materi-O's
[2:20:56] <%supercasualboom> *Rick James* They should’ve never gave you NINJAS Materia!!!!
[2:21:01] <%Dakuu75> Materi-O's, I'd eat that cereal
[2:21:02] <%Sokumotanaka> Did you know if you bring nananki (red 15) here before you go to cosmo canyon he basically yells "fucking human thieves, predicable all of them!"
[2:21:03] <%Meekest> As someone who never played FF7, did *insert character* die yet at this point
[2:21:04] <%QuietusPlays> oh god this music... that nostalgia...
[2:21:08] <LandOfTheWay> @Graxe_ yep, just checked the trailer vid on youtube. good picks i'd say
[2:21:12] <%joylent_blue> no Meekest
[2:21:14] <BigManLugan> i thought that yuffie always takes 100 materia so if you had more you could still use them
[2:21:15] <zafooru> CHAMPION - I Mean CLUMBO! You gotta heal the materia's ZOUNDS
[2:21:19] <%InugamiTheHound> what special material is on wutai that you need the golden chococbo for?
[2:21:19] <Dementedpenguin> @supercasualboom That actually made me laugh. I hate you.
[2:21:20] <bahamut1010> good place to grind

[2:21:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> even enemy skill? but it's gotten so much use
[2:21:48] <+Grayhammatter> foisted by your own petards
[2:21:53] <MildMannered> this part was painfully difficult for me...
[2:21:53] <+rynfz> What a bitch. you should poop on her when you find her.
[2:22:14] <%Jhylla81> Well, time to murder a child with our giant sword and bludgeon beast
[2:22:16] <jerobees> Materia are basically just magic anal beads, @Valdorick
[2:22:18] <%shiny_prinny> are you locked into this side quest once it starts or can you just bail with no materia?
[2:22:18] <GuilKato> how did she steal it our of your guns/knives/clothes without you noticing
[2:22:24] <%supercasualboom> Fast shot of Tifa’s ass...like what!

[2:24:54] <poweredscoot> Time for Zipang
[2:24:57] <%Starlight_Gamer> If you didnt have yuffie, would the party still go to Wutai?
[2:24:59] <%supersugoisenpai1> They don't sell to gaijin
[2:25:00] <%supercasualboom> All RPG have no toilets except Breath of Fire 2.
[2:25:00] <%Mekhet09> Your rank will suck in astral chain until you get more moves.

[2:28:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @shurtal that reminds me of when someone had something similar happen at my first job...that was a movie theater/resturant...My boss let me go home early if I cleaned it
[2:28:28] <arkv01> bort likes to take naked materia baths
[2:28:30] <%Mekhet09> @OToole42 no, this is basically a ww2 reference.

[2:28:31] <poweredscoot> Wutai ain't what it used to be
[2:28:32] <Valdorick> Tourism is worse than retail because people who can be even BIGGER dicks to you, since the odds of them ever seeing you again is so low.
[2:28:32] <fiercefiresoul> Shinra is the extreme end result of corporate libertarianism.
[2:28:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> they lost
[2:28:35] <%StaceMcGate> Crisis Core

[2:29:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, it's because Wutai is full of ninjas. The less ninjas there are, the more powerful they will be

[2:29:32] <%JJCheeker> My cousin was a manager at Jimmy John's and walked into the bathroom to a corpse
[2:29:34] <%derekwst3> @Keyd00d they look just like us
[2:29:35] <%TimetodiveLTX> cfrbug
[2:29:37] <+theshinyhunterdom> My kitten does not like that cat sound lmao she’s looking at me like wtf
[2:29:38] <poweredscoot> Kanji is just Chinese characters used in Japanese script
[2:29:39] <%shurtal> @doc_ock_rokc Where I work, general rule is "whoever sees it first, fixes the problem". Me and another guy i work with both watched it happen, I offered to clean half and he said naw... I believe I owe him a drink now.
[2:29:42] <%Laecerelius> Cats = frogs = humans. They look just like us!
[2:29:45] <+Someitalian123> are all these towns single city states?
[2:29:51] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat Wutai actually has twice the population of Midgar but they're all ninjas
[2:29:53] <Valdorick> Wait yeah fuck, what did Pat name Yuffie?
[2:29:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SIXK
[2:29:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> @JJCheeker The important question is: Was it from natural causes?
[2:29:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SICK too
[2:29:58] <+ArcLifth> So better
[2:30:03] <+Grayhammatter> i mean, that's pretty rad though
[2:30:04] <gustavozxd> So better
[2:30:04] <rufus2k2> hey it's the hokages!
[2:30:05] <Dementedpenguin> That sounds awesome.
[2:30:05] <%Starlight_Gamer> so basically the hidden leaf village?
[2:30:06] <%badchoice5> Like the Leaf Villagfe
[2:30:07] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Akuma 2020
[2:30:07] <TyrantBelial> Mount Akumore
[2:30:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @shurtal you generally do
[2:30:13] <SomersaultJustice> it's like that mountain in ala mhigo
[2:30:13] <%hntronium> @Valdorick bort
[2:30:14] <%asmistake> comes running up with a plucked chicken in hand "BEHOLD! A MAN!"
[2:30:24] <%shurtal> Honestly I was more impressed with the shear volume she produced
[2:30:24] <%JJCheeker> I think it was natural causes
[2:30:24] <%StaceMcGate> The world of FF7 are city states ruled by the Shinra corporation, Wutai is the only declared natio
[2:30:25] <chocobodundee> @FirearmsInstructor Ya! Japanese kanji are mostly copied from chinese characters though sometimes altered in appearance and/or meaning. The main I recognize is over the shop in the middle is the symbol for fire
[2:30:26] <Valdorick> Ha... Bort
[2:30:28] <%StaceMcGate> nation*
[2:30:33] <%shurtal> she was a fairly small woman
[2:30:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @shurtal diarea is a hell of a thing
[2:30:53] <%ChaosAethr> God Cant wait to see The Don Corneo sequence in the Remake
[2:30:59] <%shurtal> @doc_ock_rokc real shitty when it rears it's ugly head
[2:31:05] <%kujofire990> yeah but ala mhigo sucks
[2:31:05] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I think the most important thing about this game is it taught me that in life you should never trust anyone... especially whammaenz.
[2:31:06] <supuhmagikarp> Hey, does pat have any long range weapons with his party right now? i know red 13 can get one but not sure if pat has it
[2:31:09] <Dementedpenguin> I made a Uchiha Clan jab earlier.... but this is getting weird now
[2:31:15] <@commanderclaw> I want to see the upcoming scene in the remake
[2:31:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @shurtal its genetic after all...it runs in her jeans
[2:31:23] <Valdorick> Kain's Lance!?
[2:31:28] <+Grayhammatter> sweet, now we can floor tank
[2:31:32] <rufus2k2> you need an item to drop those flames right?
[2:31:40] <+rynfz> as someone who's never played ff7 what's the best version of it to play before the remake?
[2:31:43] <chocobodundee> leviathan scales, ya
[2:31:48] <%StaceMcGate> Leviathan scales from underwater reactor
[2:31:55] <+theshinyhunterdom> Dragoonlance is the best book series
[2:32:15] <supuhmagikarp> I'm afraid of the fight thats coming up, i don't know if Pat hat the items to fight the boss
[2:32:17] <%Sokumotanaka> Oh god wutai's gonna be TERRIFYING in the remake
[2:32:20] <%shurtal> @doc_ock_rokc Indeed, positively dripping with it
[2:32:20] <rufus2k2> @rynfz if you got a switch grab this un
[2:32:21] <poweredscoot> FF7R:DLC Shadow of Wutai
[2:32:22] <Tersalus> Was that a moth wizard?
[2:32:33] <%Jhylla81> The Switch version of ff7 is great
[2:32:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @theshinyhunterdom diskworld exists
[2:32:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @rynfz Switch for the fast forward. Anything else like PS4 if you don't care for "extras"
[2:32:35] <%JJCheeker> Where is the baby
[2:32:44] <%shiny_prinny> wutai should be huge like midgar in the remake

[2:33:21] <+Wrashis> @AngriestPat with the new oc soldier man in remake, what do you think the odds are that we'd see cissnei, the crisis core turk girl, or a similar character from one of the weird ff7 off brand spinoffs in remake
[2:33:24] <%shurtal> When i first played ff7, i got stuck here for like 2 weeks of one summer, couldn't figure out where that fuckin' clepto was hiding
[2:33:26] <Dementedpenguin> I can only imagine how much they'll expand on Wutai in the remake if Midgar is an indicator >_>
[2:33:26] <%r00ddood> r00ddood subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months!

[2:47:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yuffie is old enough to goo gah
[2:47:39] <%Jhylla81> I hope Drag Cloud is an unlockable skin for the whole game
[2:47:40] <+Caped_Eggy> She's 58

[2:47:51] <SomersaultJustice> she's like 5
[2:47:52] <%asmistake> my idea for the remake: it looks exactly like the original for PS1 did, and the prologue plays exactly the same, until at the end you discover you can move the camera and everything is rendered in engine
[2:47:54] <%mayorrev> SPOILERS
[2:47:54] <%StaceMcGate> Yuffie is old enough to kiss Cloud and not get him arrested
[2:47:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> Zemo
[2:47:59] <Dementedpenguin> The Fugitive "I don't care" line is great.

[2:48:38] <Arek_1> Unfortunately, apathy just isn't as charismatic.
[2:48:39] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Gaurdians Of The Galaxy 1 did that a bit.
[2:48:42] <%ssjklyco> This kinda happens in Fable 2 as well when your party member just shoots the main villain.
[2:48:42] <jettybandit> whoa whoa who is killing wives?!
[2:48:44] <LegitBarnacleBoy> The one armed man killed Aerith
[2:48:51] <%wydamn> Tommy is here to do a job, he doesn't care if the fugitive is innocent, he's still running from DA LAW

[2:49:01] <animalxer> @ssjklyco that pissed me off so much

[2:49:03] <%FrustratedAF> local good lad ssaryn with the clipping
[2:49:03] <%JJCheeker> But then he decides to care
[2:49:05] <arkv01> thats why he always needs boss coffee
[2:49:08] <%Starlight_Gamer> oh no... this is dumb
[2:49:11] <%Jhylla81> Make her do it

[2:49:28] <%wydamn> @arkv01 Tommy Lee Jones built most of his career on "I'm tired"

[2:49:56] <arkv01> clumbo is going to destroy that ninja pussy
[2:50:02] <%ssjklyco> @animalxer it pissed me off because you trained so much and told "youre not ready" and then you just shoot him.
[2:50:02] <%Jhylla81> That joke was bad and you should feel bad!
[2:50:03] <Dementedpenguin> That better stays in the remake
[2:50:04] <poweredscoot> it's the same
[2:50:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> That landed on Redbull's tail
[2:50:07] <%shiny_prinny> it does the same thing
[2:50:09] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat they BOTH catch you
[2:50:10] <+axenred> both levers trigger it

[2:50:13] <supuhmagikarp> yes
[2:50:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> It does.
[2:50:15] <SomersaultJustice> if you hit the left one the same thing happens and is like I tricked youuuuuuu

[2:54:06] <%Wurmspawn> It's the bAbY.
[2:54:06] <%wydamn> I mean, Control is good, but is it really 10 Mil good?
[2:54:06] <arkv01> thats fuckin nuts
[2:54:10] <RupanSen> Can't wait for Epic to fail spectacularly
[2:54:11] <arkv01> how much fuckign money is fortnite
[2:54:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That's nothing in Fortnite money.
[2:54:12] <%StaceMcGate> Is Fortnite a billion annual profit franchise?
[2:54:14] <%JJCheeker> mewwwww apatWink apatWink apatWink
[2:54:16] <%NeroInfinite> Does Epic just have unlimited money?
[2:54:17] <%InugamiTheHound> 10 million that's more then most games make back if they bomb
[2:54:19] <poweredscoot> Sell out! With me, oh yeah!
[2:54:20] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't imagine why Epic doesn't have the money to hit their roadmap objectives
[2:54:22] <future_famous_person> I never got this far in FF7
[2:54:23] <+Grayhammatter> that face is pissed
[2:54:24] <%mayorrev> In short, epic has all money in the world
[2:54:26] <%FrustratedAF> how much did that kid win at the fortnite tourney?
[2:54:27] <%TimetodiveLTX> fortnite money
[2:54:28] <%mh9s> apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo
[2:54:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> That's 'Set for life' money
[2:54:31] <%SomeNEET> Good because that game sure wasn't advertised
[2:54:34] <%Maids4lyfe> apatDab
[2:54:34] <Daoshinto> i mean WHY NOT take the scumbag's money then?
[2:54:38] <rytisone> How Epic is even making money at this point?
[2:54:38] <%Nemesis2098> WAIT HOW MUCH MONEY??
[2:54:40] <%derekwst3> can i have Tree Fiddy?
[2:54:41] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How does mon-eey works?
[2:54:41] <eanscrale> How did SNK turn that down?
[2:54:41] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> It's more of a Little Big?
[2:54:41] <%JJCheeker> elmo showing his butt
[2:54:42] <+HaunchPaunch> So if they don't sell projected, the indie gets 10 million?
[2:54:42] <%CherrieVelvet> infinite fortnite bucks
[2:54:43] <%SomeNEET> glad they made the scum munny at least
[2:54:44] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Have you seen Yuffie/Elena captured by the don first?
[2:54:45] <%ssjklyco> This feels like some weird Tax scam
[2:54:45] <%Who_lio42> only a small big

[2:54:48] <gustavozxd> not at all
[2:54:49] <%CJett92> Ya, there's no reason to NOT take that deal
[2:54:49] <StromkoPenguin> I'm not sure if Epic has all the money, or if it's Tencent, the company that owns them.
[2:54:49] <%PauliusMaximus> no one borderlands 3 is a timed exclusive
[2:54:50] <FairOnFire> they invested a lot in technology for that game though
[2:54:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Profit motive? What's that?
[2:54:54] <arkv01> @HaunchPaunch no 10 mil is the entry fee
[2:54:55] <%JJCheeker> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[2:54:55] <supuhmagikarp> you need to go to the Bell
[2:54:56] <%asmistake> all epic needs to do to make up for that is make two fortnite skins
[2:54:57] <%Mekhet09> Wrong place pat
[2:54:58] <%NeroInfinite> Consideringhow poorly controlw as advertised Yeah I'd take that money too man
[2:55:01] <%shiny_prinny> do you need to talk to the turks first?

[2:55:02] <%TimetodiveLTX> "this one's on me!"
[2:55:04] <%JetpackMcQuack> Lottery level investment
[2:55:04] <%MasterDecoder> It should be, Control is great
[2:55:06] <%InugamiTheHound> wow Epic helping developers like Remedy stay afloat
[2:55:07] <%Bad1uck> wait Epic paid 10 mil to make Control exclusive?
[2:55:09] <%shattywack> Epic's just been giving me a bunch of free shit despite me not buying a single game
[2:55:13] <%shattywack> THey're nuts
[2:55:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat all that money, and Epic still has dropped their roadmap for basic shit like a shopping cart
[2:55:21] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Go to the shrine at Goda's house
[2:55:23] <daisyyyy> Its literally irresponsible to not take the money

[3:00:18] <Valdorick> @Sokumotanaka The most important thing to remember about cats is that they think of humans as just larger cats, therefore, remember all the times a cat will pester you when you don't want to be pestered, and then pester them in the exact same way.

[3:01:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @commanderclaw It's Luke Skywalker
[3:01:18] <%StaceMcGate> Seriously, what happened to the ninjas
[3:01:20] <IndoorSitup> This is Mark Hamill if he was never in Star Wars.
[3:01:21] <+Grayhammatter> oh my god
[3:01:22] <%FrustratedAF> @commanderclaw was there ever even confirmation that corneo IS hamill?!
[3:01:24] <+CaptainGrime> @commanderclaw i feel like that would just me method acting though LUL
[3:01:25] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat do you think corneo looks like a guy from one of THOSE doujins on purpose?
[3:01:25] <%shiny_prinny> sliiiiide
[3:01:32] <%AncelDeLambert> when cornered, just Looney Toons it!
[3:01:33] <+wjones0415> no it the joker
[3:01:34] <+Grayhammatter> that's so dumb LUL
[3:01:36] <%wydamn> The matrix has you
[3:01:40] <arkv01> how does he still have control of grunts
[3:01:41] <%FrustratedAF> can't escape from crossing hate/stay sleeping
[3:01:41] <+CaptainGrime> @SomeNEET i feel like he was lol too
[3:01:44] <+Wrashis> cant escape from crossing fate
[3:01:53] <%asmistake> giant exploding gunshot produces sleep
[3:01:54] <chocobodundee> hes literally kidnapping
[3:02:05] <SomersaultJustice> "I'll get dog corneo, you guys handle spiky corneo and boobs corneo"
[3:02:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> hey was adachi always in bbtag or is this a new thing
[3:02:14] <IndoorSitup> Has anyone confirmed if Mark Hamill voices Corneo in FF7R?
[3:02:18] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Eundori zzz
[3:02:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> this game never addresses that youve killed hundreds of people.
[3:02:24] <%SomeNEET> Corneo's concept art was just the search tag Fat Ugly Bastard
[3:02:28] <%shiny_prinny> in the remake this will probably be "the fugitives are working with corneo! get em!"
[3:02:32] <+Grayhammatter> spilling bag? monkaS
[3:02:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @TimetodiveLTX saw a couple people mention a new trailer
[3:02:44] <%StaceMcGate> I mean, you could fast forward
[3:02:44] <%startstoprepeat> there's something dire about corneo's guards putting people to sleep
[3:02:46] <areallygoodname> i love a cat with a nice bag
[3:02:48] <%Dakuu75> @AngriestPat so who's the canon waifu for cloud, tifa or aerith?
[3:02:58] <shotgang86> I honestly can't believe that the remake is so close of coming out
[3:02:58] <%asmistake> that's the cat waddle
[3:02:59] <arkv01> this game is going to get blasted as fuck by sjws
[3:02:59] <ape_hawk> barret
[3:03:04] <%FrustratedAF> @startstoprepeat i can't unthink that....
[3:03:07] <ZE_Count> Hey PAT do you remember?
[3:03:09] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat So pat What Sequence in FF7R Are you Looking forward too?
[3:03:14] <Valdorick> Cannon Waifu? HE ONLY FUCKS ONE
[3:03:18] <%Sokumotanaka> Barrret
[3:03:18] <arkv01> I mean cloud can't fuck a dead body... can he?
[3:03:27] <%StaceMcGate> Can't fuck a ghost
[3:03:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> there is a scene that implies the banged.
[3:03:29] <+OkamiDude15> He can but it’s not advised to do so
[3:03:32] <Roz_Lynd> is anyone else excited we get to see cross dressing cloud in high def
[3:03:33] <%SomeNEET> @AngriestPat are Zack and Cloud wiener cousins?
[3:03:37] <%InugamiTheHound> in advent children he marries Tifa but can't stop feeling guilty about Areith's death "can sins be forgiven??"
[3:03:39] <%asmistake> ...Elena.
[3:03:41] <%MasterDecoder> @arkv01 I mean, he COULD
[3:03:44] <%asmistake> ...Bort.
[3:03:46] <%Sh00s> @SomeNEET i hope so
[3:03:46] <seamitten> anyone else getting headaches from Link's Awakening in handheld mode?
[3:03:47] <+wjones0415> yeah, he only got with aerith because he thought he was someone else
[3:03:47] <%Dakuu75> @arkv01 in a world with phoenix downs, anything is possible
[3:03:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> @SomeNEET Tunnel buddies
[3:03:55] <ZE_Count> The 21st night of september?
[3:03:56] <shotgang86> Hey Pat you know that this part of the story in the Remake you will play it at your 40's right?
[3:04:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @shotgang86 oof
[3:04:12] <ZazzyDoesStuff> @AngriestPat Is Elmoe getting more fluf on him now that it's getting towards winter?
[3:04:17] <SomersaultJustice> to Nibelheim of course!

[3:04:34] <Nettacki> LUL
[3:04:35] <+d00msdaydan> did you know? the 90s were 60 years ago
[3:04:36] <%asmistake> pat old
[3:04:37] <Djinnazz> how old are you??
[3:04:38] <shotgang86> I am also aware man we have the same age
[3:04:38] <ExpressNode> Don't tell me this game has a long ass road map
[3:04:45] <Dementedpenguin> Damn.
[3:04:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Why don't you just fucking shoot us yourself you son of a bitch?
[3:04:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> i remember playing this hwen I was 8
[3:04:50] <Dementedpenguin> LUL
[3:04:52] <+Grayhammatter> i'd say things are looking up
[3:04:54] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> =) Things are good.
[3:04:55] <%Arxel1> but you're still in your pajamas Pat
[3:04:57] <%joylent_blue> well when you put it like that
[3:04:57] <Valdorick> The PJs thing is still the same though, yeah?
[3:04:58] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> You didn't have a cat or pajamas when you were 11?
[3:04:58] <%wydamn> You mean you weren't wearing your pyjamas last time?
[3:04:58] <%Dakuu75> stop reminding us 90's and 80's kids of our age, CHAT
[3:04:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> They're gonna be playing 80's music in Nursing Homes soon
[3:04:59] <%NeroInfinite> Yeah you've got ajob and a girlfriend this time
[3:05:00] <%asmistake> next time you will play it from your floating space mansion in space
[3:05:02] <%GabeSweetMan> You're not just helping it set in, you're shoving it into our chest cavity.
[3:05:02] <%ssjklyco> They are real this time.
[3:05:06] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> Were you a homelss 11 year old?
[3:05:07] <%StaceMcGate> still dating your sister
[3:05:11] <lemon_lore> when the grandkid
[3:05:13] <IndoorSitup> I have to know: Does Mark Hamill really voice Don Corneo in FF7 Remake?
[3:05:17] <rytisone> I remember first time playing it...7 years ago
[3:05:21] <%StaceMcGate> @IndoorSitup no
[3:05:22] <+nekodelic> please, don't activate Crazy Talk
[3:05:27] <+OkamiDude15> Next time pat will have the taxidermy animal. Whether the animal is Paige or Elmo is for fate to decide
[3:05:29] <ZE_Count> Im going to fail at squatting so I get the shitty merkin wig.
[3:05:35] <%Deft_Thought> @AngriestPat Which do you find more frustrating in JRPGs: status effect deaths (Stone/Paralysis) or Insta-kill moves?
[3:05:40] <%JJCheeker> I won't be around to see it but I will be here in spirit
[3:05:44] <IndoorSitup> @stacemcgate source?
[3:05:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @OkamiDude15 it will be both
[3:05:48] <shotgang86> so yeah I will also play this at my 40s
[3:05:48] <%asmistake> my vote is insta-kills
[3:05:54] <%InugamiTheHound> I was in 3rd grade when I first played ff7
[3:05:58] <Ner234> It just occured to me that it's 2019 and that there people in chat that are adults but weren't born in the 90s. NotLikeThis
[3:05:58] <Valdorick> The ultimate activation of crazy talk right now would be Square going bankrupt after FF7:Re1
[3:06:11] <%ChaosAethr> You Mean DOOM
[3:06:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fucking Rollout Miltank
[3:06:17] <Valdorick> Can't play the game in your 40s if its never released.
[3:06:18] <%Dakuu75> I dunno. Bad Breath is worse imo
[3:06:19] <%ChaosAethr> Hate DOOM
[3:06:19] <rytisone> Tornberry is a fuck
[3:06:22] <%shiny_prinny> bosses you have to kill at the same time
[3:06:23] <ilthyf> huy
[3:06:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> Quick Time bullshit not previously introducted that's just dumped on you.
[3:06:26] <%umbypokochan> yeah like when I accidentally walk off the edge during a boss fight in FFXIV........
[3:06:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Both end up using an item or spell to cure, so they both suck.
[3:06:31] <RupanSen> the worst is when you can't apply statuses on bosses
[3:06:34] <%Deft_Thought> DOOM is frustrating because the number just makes me anxious as hell
[3:06:35] <%phytopath> phytopath subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:06:39] <ape_hawk> anything from FF13
[3:06:41] <StryfeDragon> I'd argue what's worse is either piercing stats (ignores immunities) or moves that always do static high damage no matter what your defense stat is
[3:06:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Doom status can die in a weiner fire
[3:06:43] <ape_hawk> basically
[3:06:44] <%Big_Dream> i thogut pat was like 32
[3:06:46] <+OkamiDude15> Not a fan of if the mc dies you game over
[3:06:48] <%joylent_blue> BEES?
[3:06:51] <%joylent_blue> oh wait
[3:06:54] <%joylent_blue> FIRE?
[3:06:55] <%FrustratedAF> anyone ever think about how we're getting a fuckin deadly premonition 2?!
[3:07:03] <ExpressNode> I think its cutscenes in where you get beat when you think you might have a chance that I hate
[3:07:06] <gustavozxd> oh yeah, protagonist dying and then game over is the worst of all
[3:07:11] <+Wrashis> he is 32, and this part wont be here till like the third of 4th game
[3:07:12] <Teiwaz12> Nomura is 48. I wonder if he'll live to see the remake finished.
[3:07:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> another decade in the books. whats the gen after zoomers going to be memed into
[3:07:13] <%InugamiTheHound> @OkamiDude15 final fantasy 13 and 15 are like that
[3:07:18] <+Wrashis> if remake 1 is just midgar
[3:07:18] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat So You Hate the Doom Debuff
[3:07:19] <+IronPickle> It's because he's not weighed down by all that magic materia you never use
[3:07:19] <+rynfz> Rude
[3:07:21] <Ner234> @OkamiDude15 The only that ever made sense was in Valkyrie Profile
[3:07:34] <@commanderclaw> Renau the fuckboi
[3:07:35] <%StaceMcGate> @IndoorSitup Nothing is listed for his voice actor yet, but with a high profile name like Hamill they would of just stated so already. The rest of the voice cast are newcomers
[3:07:36] <%InugamiTheHound> Rude looks like pitbull in the ff7 remake LOL
[3:07:36] <+Grayhammatter> fucking what?
[3:07:37] <%Agami23> reno the fuckboy
[3:07:38] <%Deft_Thought> T POSING
[3:07:39] <%zamzoph> Reno and Rude are not the sort to go "grrr"...
[3:07:40] <%Dakuu75> christ air

[3:07:54] <%Agami23> the statue is crying
[3:07:54] <corn_dad> A 'Turk'
[3:07:54] <+Grayhammatter> crucifying on EYES?
[3:07:55] <ape_hawk> oh god, is Corneo goddamn Caesar????
[3:07:56] <arkv01> corneos dick knows NO LIMITS
[3:07:56] <%shiny_prinny> 16 i think, but still
[3:07:58] <+OkamiDude15> At least in 15 you could Phoenix yourself
[3:07:59] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> the real hero is here
[3:07:59] <poweredscoot> it's legal in wutai tho
[3:08:01] <Ner234> Eww
[3:08:02] <@commanderclaw> Why are there suspicious quotation marks over 'Turk'?
[3:08:03] <%joylent_blue> DansGame

[3:08:18] <%Deft_Thought> Can't WAIT to see this shit in Remake!
[3:08:21] <animalxer> Yuffie pleasures old men for materia!
[3:08:22] <arkv01> NOTHING can stop corneos raging bepis
[3:08:22] <+Grayhammatter> oh man, it's CLMUBO
[3:08:24] <%AncelDeLambert> he's a dirty POOR and can GTFO

[3:08:27] <%Big_Dream> Cornero is gonna give her the GOO Gah
[3:08:30] <%SGrim> Yuffie gives it up for any man with rocks?
[3:08:32] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> isn't 16 the age of consent in Japan?
[3:08:34] <%laserbeaming> hehe trap
[3:08:35] <%SomeNEET> Hoes Crucified (x24)
[3:08:39] <IndoorSitup> Imagine Mark Hamill voicing this all shit.
[3:08:39] <ExpressNode> Is this one of those cases where they change her age based on region or is it the same across the board?
[3:08:41] <Wizardism> i hard locked myself in this area the first time i played.
[3:08:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I can't believe I forgot the part in this game where some old dude crucified and threatened to rape a teenage girl
[3:08:48] <%GabeSweetMan> SUCH A TOUCHING TRAGEDY
[3:08:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @IndoorSitup stop talking about my dreams, dammit
[3:08:54] <Valdorick> I want cloud to tell him "WE DON'T CARE"... Tifa doing so works too

[3:08:59] <Teiwaz12> FWIW, when this game came out nude photobooks of actual children were still legal in Japan
[3:09:02] <+OkamiDude15> @zaphire_saucypants I think it’s 18+
[3:09:02] <%zamzoph> we better get a full Corneo flashback in Remake Part II
