[0:19:32] <cerberuscarmine> coward!
[0:19:32] <prime_name> Woolie wouldn't get it.
[0:19:32] <%Metballs> Not until way after TMS
[0:19:33] <+Xooler67> God no
[0:19:33] <+Order_of_Mystery> Witcher 3 is the only good Witcher game.
[0:19:34] <$Chimeraelite> No. The Witcher is on a TOTALLY different level than the Witcher
[0:19:34] <DLN002> Do it
[0:19:34] <deviljhojho94> IT WAS WORTH IT
[0:19:36] <+HypotheticalWalrus> As much as I wouold love to see that, I dont know if you want to start up a 500 episode series
[0:19:36] <Lmsd944> loved KOTOR
[0:19:37] <MyNameIsRasus> Kowashitai
[0:19:38] <TheInkshow> they just stop with JRPG also

[0:19:47] <Ser_Randal> THE WEEBS GET MIRAGE GIVE US WITCHER
[0:19:48] <ValidVenasaur> witcher 1 is not lp material
[0:19:48] <Dendregal> woolie and wild hunt would just be 20 episodes of gwent
[0:19:49] <TheImmortal70> Kotor as a whole was nice
[0:19:49] <+panickedcanadian> Loved Kotor way back,was happy when you guys picked that up
[0:19:51] <%ssjklyco> I'd imagine the controls would be too jank to LP the Witcher
[0:19:51] <+Griffin1171> 8 squared
[0:19:52] <Qyuubey> Dragon Age 1 might be OK.
[0:19:52] <Eresus> lp poison
[0:19:52] <InsomniacPersona> I liked it for the first 20 parts

[0:20:31] <+HypotheticalWalrus> I liked the style switching in witcher 1, but aparently everyone else hates
[0:20:33] <randomp141> Witcher 1 was ok.
[0:20:33] <TheImmortal70> Witcher 1 is way WAY too jank
[0:20:33] <PakuV2> EEEEEEEEEEEENTER the Audio

[0:20:34] <Divryne> Shut up Pat I loved Witcher 1 too.
[0:20:35] <+Griffin1171> witcher 1 is jank as shit
[0:20:37] <+RC_S3kshun8> !uptime
[0:20:37] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 20m 39s.
[0:20:38] <+Sora20030c> Eurojank is the true genre

[0:20:38] <+jkobe34> I like witcher 1
[0:20:39] <%ssjklyco> I played the shit out of Witcher 1, but never beat it.
[0:20:40] <+FreddyLeeSavage> hampsterfarts likes it
[0:20:41] <+TheShal> Witcher 1 is GOAT
[0:20:41] <KeeperofTheScum_> witcher 1 is trash
[0:20:42] <deviljhojho94> just like me LUL
[0:20:43] <+kraajkase> Witcher 1 grew on me eventually
[0:20:43] <%lutefiiisk> Those sexcards though
[0:20:43] <houseguardbro> Any plans on Battle Assault 3 for Scrublords/Fisticuffs? It seems a perfect match for Woolie.
[0:20:44] <+WeeabooHotdog> witcher 1 has really good writing but the combat is complete doodoo and the beginning is sloow
[0:20:45] <+RC_S3kshun8> Oh nice, just started
[0:20:47] <+NiktenKing> Yeah, but that's Paige though. Paige is crazy
[0:20:48] <+Ghally> Witcher 1 is my fav of the tree
[0:20:48] <FatDragonQuest> you could theoretically do an lp of a shadowrun game
[0:20:48] <GUNxSPECTRE> Witcher 1 lovers are game hipsters
[0:20:48] <mercado94> play kingdom hearts
[0:20:48] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Best jank
[0:20:49] <Animal_Farm4> Witcher one is great DESPITE its combat.
[0:20:49] <SubliminaIMessages> Witcher 1's gameplay was dogshit but the story was great
[0:20:49] <rararasputino> A lot of the story stuff sounds up Woolie's alley tho
[0:20:50] <Arrowneck> Witcher 1 is great.
[0:20:50] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Witcher 1 is super weird, 2 is better and 3 is finally Less Jank
[0:20:50] <eska_eskaria> i could not get a grip of Witcher 1, Witcher 3 is amazing though
[0:20:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Just start with 3
[0:20:52] <%galaxyswirl> When has being wrong about something ever stopped me before- Patrick Boivin 2018
[0:20:53] <+cerass> witcher 1 isn't good... its anti fun. story is great
[0:20:54] <+RC_S3kshun8> Hey Pat - Still going to finish RE2?
[0:20:54] <Bobbledygook> Witcher 3 would be too fukin long
[0:20:54] <TheImmortal70> You can look at Witcher 1 and actively ask yourself how 2 and 3 exist
[0:20:56] <Valask> You can start with witcher 2 like most people did
[0:20:56] <thetiniestbump> To be fair all old RPGs now have some weird ass jank to them.
[0:20:57] <Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat You are my favourite Coward, Pat!! Can you call me a coward please?
[0:20:57] <girlmeat> witcher 1 is a piece of shit
[0:20:57] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> OK When's Warframe though
[0:20:57] <+RowenCleric> god that would be such a long LP
[0:20:58] <+Shaggnar> I can't even get into Witcher 2 because the controls were not great
[0:21:00] <meatgeneral69> lp poison
[0:21:01] <+oAlec687> I clicked the mouse and said "this is not for me"
[0:21:03] <Mittensbro> The problem with Witcher 1 is that its combat is ass on fire and you baically need to combine with magic for it to not suck complete shit
[0:21:03] <Soul_Intern> It's because Paige is WEAK
[0:21:04] <$MajorCrasher> I played it for 2 hours and said, this is far too eurojank for me
[0:21:05] <%Metballs> Nah, just do a Dougie Grandpa and start at Witcher 3
[0:21:06] <+Worldbrand> I didnt really get hit by the jank until i tried fighting a golem. Like, I felt the jank, but it didnt stop me until then
[0:21:06] <haiku0kami> Doesn't witcher 1 have a mod that fixes all the bullshit or is that the remaster? woopsThink
[0:21:07] <%lutefiiisk> apatBig apatMenace
[0:21:08] <Klefth> I would watch witcher 1 but I would NOT fucking play it

[0:26:12] <%ssjklyco> I'm afraid to start FF XV again because I don't remember how to play.
[0:26:13] <+Griffin1171> Pat, shit on Clemps for liking FFTA
[0:26:14] <+cerass> cheer200 so I've started playing everything I can on my arcade stick from P5 to wipeout to dbfz. trying to get as second nature with it as possible. thoughts?
[0:26:15] <Valask> I have never ever seen melee before, but I hate its players because of you. Yay?
[0:26:23] <$SGrim> !lam
[0:26:24] <%vinnysuperg123> PAt I heard you REALLY like FFTA
[0:26:29] <%TeaJayGee> is it weird that i have conisidered breaking my arm so that i dont have to go back to work tomorrow
[0:26:44] <Soul_Intern> @Valask Melee just sucks, embrace it
[0:26:48] <Darren716> Thats every stream though
[0:26:48] <+FailedCelestial> Pat and Enter the Gungeon PogChamp
[0:26:49] <NopeBadguy> JESUS
[0:26:51] <@SSaryn> No.
[0:26:53] <%Sora20030c> I feel that
[0:26:53] <%Asagi66> @AngriestPat you heard about the smt mobile game called smt dx2
[0:26:53] <NopeBadguy> THAT'S EXTREME
[0:26:54] <$GohanEgret> just do drugs
[0:26:54] <+robert_edwards> RE5 has been a fun watch tell Matt to reload his fucking gun.
[0:26:54] <@SSaryn> Don't do.
[0:26:55] <Miikaaeeel> "Content creation *cracks a beer* Is a job like any other" Kappa
[0:26:56] <%poseidon2> @Valask Melee is one of my favorite spectator games don't let the shit about smash players take you away from the fact that it's actually super hype
[0:26:56] <Rincewind1998> @IamSLiM2 Those are the same type of people who buy the newest model of phone while their current one works fine. If you get some quality stuff to start, you won't need to upgrade for a while.
[0:26:56] <@WoolyFish> Do it you coward.
[0:26:57] <Soul_Intern> WE ARE THE CAMER PogChamp
[0:26:57] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> ENTER THE GUNGEON SECOND GIG
[0:26:58] <%Metballs> Everyone's thought of that at least once
[0:26:58] <%Remery_> Yea just cry on the toilet instead
[0:26:59] <$ImasukyLomae> i relate
[0:26:59] <Spydurman> just say you broke it
[0:26:59] <Animal_Farm4> Just break the one arm, no need to double down
[0:26:59] <haiku0kami> uhhhhhh, monkaS
[0:27:00] <$googleygareth> Speaking of retail, I was thinking of animating that story where Pat talks about his boss asking him to come in on an off day.
[0:27:01] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> How bad is that job?
[0:27:01] <GUNxSPECTRE> Especially if American. $$$$$
[0:27:02] <haiku0kami> leyM
[0:27:02] <copyritetm> GULP
[0:27:04] <ELuscious> BREAK JUST THE FINGA
[0:27:04] <Mr_Strut> I broke my arm once. It sucks.
[0:27:04] <%Typhaeon> You wouldn't be able to do anything else rfun
[0:27:04] <$Chimeraelite> No don't do that. THINK OF THE MONEY MAN
[0:27:05] <%mister___doctor> Ask for some time off man
[0:27:05] <+Order_of_Mystery> So how long has it been since you played Gungeon, Pat?
[0:27:05] <JDRK> but maybe do it though
[0:27:05] <Soul_Intern> monkaS
[0:27:05] <jinkipng> PLS CHANGE JOBS
[0:27:06] <mercado94> @AngriestPat did you put googly eyes to the camera so its easier to talk to?
[0:27:09] <Mittensbro> @IamSLiM2 The problem is that the PC market is really much more tuned for people who are freaks about high graphics options. Typically, you can have a rig that will play games for years by paying for something that's like $600, and then you getoverall cheaper games without an online payment subscription
[0:27:09] <rytisone> Tell us how it makes you feel
[0:27:10] <xIgnitionCrowx> Is taking a shit considered content creation?
[0:27:10] <+Worldbrand> It's not weird until you get the hammer out
[0:27:10] <dawnengel> thats self harm
[0:27:11] <+Griffin1171> FFTA 1st gig
[0:27:12] <WaxWitch> weird? no, understandable? yes
[0:27:14] <%ssjklyco> The phone calls don't stop man
[0:27:14] <Soulsofdeathx> Do all the drugs to make life better
[0:27:14] <%Cranky_Construct> That's pretty hardcore
[0:27:15] <deviljhojho94> JUST BREAK SOME FINGERS OFFA YER FEET
[0:27:16] <$eldrich_horror> break it at work tomorrow and get workmens comp
[0:27:16] <%Sora20030c> Every day I work at McDonald's Is another day I regret not calling out
[0:27:20] <$SGrim> @IamSLiM2 the people who spend 500$ a year are going for total optimization at all times. A good 500$ PC can match console performance for an entire generation, and comes with free online connections.
[0:27:22] <LoadingFWANK> stop giving them ideas pat
[0:27:25] <$GohanEgret> @xIgnitionCrowx isn't that just the blooper reel?
[0:27:26] <grayjammer> Paounds
[0:27:26] <Soul_Intern> Dude, you ever just want to hurt yourself to stop working?
[0:27:27] <%OdysseyKnight> Is it weird that I've considered breaking SSaryn's arms so I can't go into work?
[0:27:27] <+Jacknzack27> That joke in re7 about killing yourself to fight the ghost on it's level is probably my favorite joke from you guys ever
[0:27:32] <%TheGershon> @IamSLiM2 you don't need to by crazy like those guys, if you get a good machine during the generation you really don't have to upgrade until the next
[0:27:33] <@WoolyFish> Pat's paypal is super racist.
[0:27:33] <hydroarsonist69> 50 pounds is like 10000 CAD holy shit
[0:27:34] <$grimpokemon> Sometimes work drives you to break your body over it
[0:27:35] <ELuscious> 🤔
[0:27:35] <hard_bop_sax_solo> one time I threw up at work on purpose but my manager saw me putting my fingers down my throat so I had to clean it up and continue working
[0:27:36] <$MajorCrasher> just kill yourself, then you never have to work again!
[0:27:38] <+ThirstyMichael> @AngriestPat any chance at getting Woolie to play Morrowind for the channel?
[0:27:39] <%crot45> @angriestpat man ive been working retail for 3 years now but haven't had a more than 3 days in a row off
[0:27:41] <eska_eskaria> When suicide is better than a day at work, its time to find a new job XD
[0:27:45] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> B U S I N E S S

[0:58:11] <kvnmck94> shes a gimmicky shit
[0:58:14] <%TokyoCosmos> blessings randomly change your gun
[0:58:17] <the_sprankton> blessed runs are interesting
[0:58:18] <%Verd_254> shoot gun
[0:58:19] <+YabbaTroll> @AngriestPat usually in chest rooms
[0:58:20] <tacostarvedbeast> they are usually in the chest rooms
[0:58:20] <+NiktenKing> Blessing is just gun game... in a gun game
[0:58:21] <Djinnazz> chest rooms and shops.
[0:58:22] <+thetruewaifu> pro tip: just dont bother tbh
[0:58:22] <SaltyAzteca> SHOOT. THE WALL.
[0:58:22] <%konekoryugamine> THAT WAS THE CUTEST FUCKING BULLET
[0:58:23] <FatDragonQuest> quick say a cuss before he loads it up
[0:58:24] <%TokyoCosmos> after some ammo or enemies are kileld
[0:58:24] <lloyddboy> pray

[0:58:27] <+TheShal> Oh man. He's done reading? He's playing a VIDEO GAME!? Fuck this. I'm going to go unsub from SuperBunnyHop
[0:58:27] <+Sheepwalk> Pro tip: buy 50 blanks and use them in every room
[0:58:28] <DLN002> shoot wall with not starting gun
[0:58:28] <mercado94> hola7
[0:58:28] <Mr_Strut> Shoot walls with limited ammo weapons
[0:58:29] <+Bupkis7> enbSwoleL GUN enbSwoleR
[0:58:30] <Rincewind1998> Best places to look for secret rooms are the shop and rooms with a chest
[0:58:30] <%konekoryugamine> READ THIS
[0:58:30] <+JEiddew> shoot gun
[0:58:30] <%TokyoCosmos> shoot walls they tend to be in shops
[0:58:31] <+Order_of_Mystery> @AngriestPat shoot walls with guns that use ammo.
[0:58:33] <+butteryfan24> I use Marine because I'm trash
[0:58:34] <superbla25> shoot walls in chest rooms
[0:58:36] <kvnmck94> secret walls dont have a clear pattern like Isaac walls.
[0:58:37] <%Unlimited_> @grimpokemon it'll showup in the settings under connected accounts in discord (could take some time)
[0:58:37] <Mr_Strut> Usually in chest or elevator rooms
[0:58:38] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> BEGIN GUN
[0:58:39] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat you havent done the tutorial for the new tutorial rewards yet
[0:58:41] <%ssjklyco> Use blanks
[0:58:41] <Crankthulhu> @AngriestPat Before this update, hidden rooms were connected to chest rooms often
[0:58:42] <lethallylactic> @AngriestPat Shoot walls of chest rooms and rooms that are dead ends typically.
[0:58:43] <Spydurman> Blessings give you infinite guns that change randomly
[0:58:44] <%konekoryugamine> OH MY GOD THOSE BULLETS ARE ADORABLE
[0:58:47] <SwindlerOfProgress> @AngriestPat For secret walls, shoot the walls in the chest rooms, usually. If any of them crack, use a blank.
[0:58:50] <SaltyAzteca> @AngriestPat Brick of Cash can help you find breakable walls
[0:58:54] <CharileMurphyPendelton> and MOON LIGHTER
[0:59:05] <kvnmck94> fill outt the map, so you know where on the map has room
[0:59:05] <narkonis> @AngriestPat pat you dont want to waste crossbow shots on walls, they do more damage
[0:59:05] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> alot less poop too
[0:59:06] <%konekoryugamine> THEY ARE BULLETS THAT FIRE GUNS.
[0:59:07] <Dendregal> @AngriestPat for secret rooms if you got blanks after a boss, use them in chest room/( elevator room to next floor
[0:59:07] <%treebeard24> holy shit, that's a thing?! @SwindlerOfProgress
[0:59:09] <gryffinp> Did Pat every play old Issac?
[0:59:09] <%ssjklyco> Its not gross either
[0:59:10] <+SirRoyco> It's also not ugly as sin
[0:59:10] <umbypokochan> wow, how do you go that fast?
[0:59:12] <+NaotoKozuki> God i feel the exact opposite
[0:59:12] <PakuV2> Arcane gunpowder is in 3rd chamber
[0:59:12] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Yeah but this one doesn't make Woolie sweat profusely
[0:59:12] <%konekoryugamine> THAT'S BACKWARDS AND ADORABLE AS HELL
[0:59:13] <+Sheepwalk> @AngriestPat if you have armor and you get hit, those can reveal secret walls
[0:59:13] <SnaKemuho> it feels even better with kb&m Kappa
[0:59:13] <Senselessvirus> @AngriestPat hop over the tables for fun and profit!
[0:59:18] <%simpo98> this and Nuclear Throne and Isaac are my games @AngriestPat in the genre
[0:59:19] <+NiktenKing> Isaac is too predictabo
[0:59:25] <%Sora20030c> but it had diagonalds on rebirth
[0:59:27] <outis94> what about the Issac card game?
[0:59:27] <%grimpokemon> @Unlimited_ Thank you very much
[0:59:28] <%Verd_254> The one thing I like about BoI is tear mods can lead to weird effects.
[0:59:30] <+Quarkee> the game... is fun
[0:59:33] <+Griffin1171> I wish gungeon had isaac's progression
[0:59:33] <GoldeNOVA> I like Isaac much much better
[0:59:34] <DLN002> @SaltyAzteca There's also a synergy called Insight that has Bloodborne esque horrors show up at the entrances of secret rooms. It's dope.
[0:59:36] <%Unlimited_> no problem
[0:59:39] <%konekoryugamine> WHY IS THIS GAME CUTE
[0:59:43] <%konekoryugamine> FUUUUCK
[0:59:48] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:52] <burna_lova> @AngriestPat Use a crappy gun for wall shooting, and items like Table Tech Blanks and Elder Blank allow you to find walls without using standard blanks.
[0:59:56] <Osusurrus> Gungeon does have good progression doe
[0:59:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> !uptime
[0:59:56] <umbypokochan> why can Pat go so fast? how do i get that???
[0:59:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 59m 58s.
[0:59:58] <+Order_of_Mystery> Question for chat and Pat: when you play this, where are your eyes focused on? I have a hard time getting over tunnel vision.
[0:59:58] <+YabbaTroll> SLING

[1:08:54] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat have to steal, it's a Payday 2 reference
[1:08:54] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> it costs 9999 bullets
[1:08:54] <Rincewind1998> Once you steal it its available for normal prices
[1:08:54] <ShaggyHighlander> You can get it normally after the first time

[1:08:57] <KTDelgado> steal
[1:08:58] <+Sheepwalk> no take, only steal
[1:08:59] <%Ninestempest> Oh my god YOU CAN GET TH EICE BREAKER???
[1:09:00] <kvnmck94> any charm effect or stealth effect
[1:09:02] <+thetruewaifu> you have to steal it but you can use items to steal it without losing shop
[1:09:04] <AJusticeLemon> becomes a normal item after
[1:09:04] <SaltyAzteca> @AngriestPat You SHOULD be able to get it easier now.
[1:09:04] <+PenmanLupine> every one of these bullets remind me of the Banana Guards from Adventure Time
[1:09:07] <%PinkSuprende> Any of the Payday items you steal once and then they appear normally anywhere at regular price/chests
[1:09:07] <Dendregal> no, you dont have to steal it anymore
[1:09:09] <%TokyoCosmos> it increases chances of other payday 2 weps
[1:09:10] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you have to steal it once, now you can buy it
[1:09:15] <+Griffin1171> it becomes a pickup, doesn't it
[1:09:15] <+Matto424> I mean it's a payday item so of course ya gotta steal it at least once

[1:09:24] <mr_gentleman96> Once you unlock it once it gets put into the normal item pool @AngriestPat
[1:09:26] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat all Payday items have to be stolen TO UNLOCK. Then they will appear normally
[1:09:26] <+LogothX> Guns shooting guns isnt on the nose enough, the bullets should shoot other bullets
[1:09:31] <kvnmck94> ye, after you get it once its normal price

[1:11:42] <eldritchmoeblob> you don't pay anything to fight
[1:11:49] <%rdark_ksu> i do not believe a crossbow counts as a gun
[1:11:50] <SwindlerOfProgress> Did you use a key for that chest? I don't think so!
[1:11:51] <jalordahedorah> best gun acquired (with synergy)
[1:11:53] <ShaggyHighlander> It has some half decent synergies with the new update
[1:11:54] <MunaMuna9> The gungeon ant has the best synergy tho
[1:11:56] <kwangalang> that stupid gun literally killed me
[1:11:57] <krin_x> nothing in life is free
[1:12:03] <$Desmond_Vakarian> have you knocked a table into a pit yet ?
[1:12:05] <%TokyoCosmos> gungeon ant is slept on
[1:12:06] <%rer0le> if it synergies with the crown gun its godlike
[1:12:06] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Anyone else hate tables in this game?
[1:12:07] <+LuckyChocobo> Me neither, this area is so hard
[1:12:11] <+Sheepwalk> There's a version of that which is just a dinosaur skull and it's even worse
[1:12:14] <+Crippl3> I've beaten sewer once, but died on the next immediately lol
[1:12:16] <VritraReiRei> CLEMPS!
[1:12:18] <%treebeard24> which floor is he on?
[1:12:18] <DLN002> Gungeon Ant has one really good synergy
[1:12:19] <ThDark> It's not that hard, honestly
[1:12:20] <kvnmck94> oublette is no joke, mostly cuz its early on an your not always decked out
[1:12:23] <DLN002> that actually makes it usable
[1:12:25] <+NiktenKing> Oubilette
[1:12:25] <AJusticeLemon> I love the tables
[1:12:32] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you have to steal it once, now you can buy it on future runs
[1:12:38] <+QuietWyatt211> old king floor is harder
[1:12:39] <%cerass> clempsy boi
[1:12:41] <knomad2b> it gets much worse after the game gets harder
[1:12:42] <+Sheepwalk> I'd rather do Floor 3 than Oublette
[1:12:47] <Seraphile> seems like a good warmup run to me
[1:12:50] <cheezbass> use the tables man
[1:12:51] <SwindlerOfProgress> I appreciate synergies making some guns not trash.

[1:14:36] <SaltyAzteca> HAHA!!
[1:14:36] <cheezbass> I WAS NOT READY FOR A GODHAND REFERENCE
[1:14:39] <lloyddboy> ok that was pretty good
[1:14:40] <$Bncbck> oh lord i thought it was the mdk apple for a second
[1:14:40] <DXLelouch24> this game is filled to the brim with memes i hear
[1:14:40] <Alseid> Are you nervous?
[1:14:41] <+LogothX> @DarkShadow124 Milky way has stuff going. Payday is just a bar of fucking nuts.
[1:14:47] <%Ninestempest> si that why the quote is alexander
[1:14:50] <+Sheepwalk> I'm so glad Pat of all people found that item
[1:14:50] <+Crippl3> god how is the music in this game so good
[1:14:58] <kvnmck94> come take a walk with me
[1:14:59] <the_sprankton> since when can you save hearts?
[1:15:02] <deviljhojho94> GOTTA LET IT OUT GOTTA LET IT OUT
[1:15:03] <cheezbass> save for later doesnt work unlesss you have a jar
[1:15:04] <kvnmck94> as a corner myself
[1:15:07] <+Crippl3> @the_sprankton new update
[1:15:18] <+Crippl3> @the_sprankton they go into a candy machine you can access at stores and after the boss
[1:15:20] <DXLelouch24> i wonder if they added a devil trigger yet
[1:15:22] <+LuckyChocobo> Remember, you've got that rocket launcher
[1:15:33] <+Sheepwalk> It's garbage unless you have flight
[1:15:34] <Cosairen> this floor reminds me of 20xx in chronotrigger
[1:15:41] <+resstarr> not a fan of the ant fun either
[1:15:42] <+thetruewaifu> the ant gun is good if you leave it in fire mode and cheat reload by switching weapons
[1:15:44] <+LuckyChocobo> It shoots fireballs, how is that bad?
[1:15:55] <%TokyoCosmos> its got good knockback for pit filled areas
[1:16:05] <Klefth> Did that chievo just say Pie Lord?
[1:16:09] <Trajanic> so weird how you have a better chance at getting a good gun in nuclear throne than this
[1:16:13] <SwindlerOfProgress> I'd rather have the Fossil Gun. At least that one takes the dumb fire shit over the edge.
[1:16:15] <%TokyoCosmos> and youre not gonna need money drops this run too much
[1:16:16] <+D3rrtyD4n> its ok
[1:16:17] <kvnmck94> its alright
[1:16:18] <lloyddboy> no
[1:16:18] <VritraReiRei> not really
[1:16:18] <+Crippl3> It's OK, fire is good
[1:16:19] <DLN002> only with synergies
[1:16:20] <SwindlerOfProgress> It's pretty bad.
[1:16:20] <kvnmck94> weird tho
[1:16:22] <SaltyAzteca> It depends
[1:16:22] <Rincewind1998> Pat, the sling will take care of all your boss-killing needs, so feel free to use the rocket launcher for rooms
[1:16:23] <EASrake> it seems alrit
[1:16:23] <deviljhojho94> Eh
[1:16:24] <+LuckyChocobo> Looks pretty dang good to me
[1:16:24] <+seaearthandsky> ***
[1:16:25] <+Sheepwalk> ehhhhh
[1:16:27] <$RaikenTB> This reminds me of Loaded.
[1:16:28] <Rigenstein> if you know how to use it
[1:16:28] <+Matto424> It's not the worst gun but ti's also not great
[1:16:30] <SaltyAzteca> yIts a denial area weapon
[1:16:33] <zazzera01> all bad guns are eventually good with synergies
[1:16:43] <+Sheepwalk> Derringer is 100% worst gun
[1:16:46] <Seraphile> why do i feel the boss is gonna be medusa
[1:16:49] <+thetruewaifu> zoom out the map

[1:17:36] <ThDark> Fightsaber is ridiculous
[1:17:41] <%NovaKnightmare> T shirt cannon is the way Maude Flanders died too
[1:17:43] <$magikestral> don't worry about that cursed purple skull that popped up
[1:17:49] <rufus2k2> @fredan31 this is more challenging becuase you can break isaac way too easy
[1:17:49] <the_sprankton> @Crippl3 more damage, but also more jammed enemies
[1:17:52] <+LogothX> Look at this legally distinct Zelda boss door
[1:17:52] <kvnmck94> whats confuzed?

[1:19:33] <cerberuscarmine> D:
[1:19:36] <EASrake> that's a fun one

[1:19:47] <$magikestral> earthworm jim is neat
[1:19:48] <mercado94> woah
[1:19:48] <zamzoph> GROOVY
[1:19:50] <VritraReiRei> NOT TRUE
[1:19:52] <Rincewind1998> @eveningmars it actualyl depends on what tier stuff you put in there
[1:19:54] <Djinnazz> It depends on what you put in it.
[1:19:55] <%craig_t> halloo
[1:19:57] <%PinkSuprende> Gun Munchers have exclusive specific recipeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
[1:20:01] <%eveningmars> Is that right
[1:20:02] <JingoJungler> dog BibleThump
[1:20:05] <MunaMuna9> @eveningmars actually it's based on the items you put in. a good item and a bad item make an average item
[1:20:05] <SwindlerOfProgress> I thought this gun was trash until I found its alternate effect. Heck Blaster is fucking sick.
[1:20:09] <+Sheepwalk> It depends on the weapon quality
[1:20:11] <cheezbass> fuck reloading
[1:20:11] <Seraphile> hitscan?
[1:20:13] <thelonechris> 1000 bullets
[1:20:15] <$Chimeraelite> This gun is the most gun of all
[1:20:16] <IncredibleMeh> Simple and clean!
[1:20:17] <SaltyAzteca> @AngriestPat Gun Munchers give you Tiered weapons depending on what you put in
[1:20:19] <+panickedcanadian> Earthworm Jim gun is Always great
[1:20:20] <%eveningmars> I don't think you can get S-tier though, right? There's some cap
[1:20:23] <eldritchmoeblob> I THOUGHT YOU HATED THE TMP THO
[1:20:24] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat Gun Munchers give the AVERAGE, occasionally slightly higher than average of the two consumed guns
[1:20:27] <kvnmck94> you pull the trigger an it shoot da guy
[1:20:27] <+thetruewaifu> shotguns best guns imo
[1:20:30] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat putting specific guns into the gun muncher has special results, and the overall quality of your normal munches is based on the weapons you put in
[1:20:33] <Dapper_Cactuar> there are cursed gun munchers that can give you really good guns, but they require a random number of guns. I've seen some require 10 guns
[1:20:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> GROOVY
[1:20:36] <$googleygareth> Think that's the first hitscan gun I've seen in the game.

[1:23:06] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat the red ammo packs give 25% ammo to all guns and 50% to the EQUPPED gun

[1:24:43] <Eresus> yes
[1:24:45] <%TokyoCosmos> not every time
[1:24:45] <lethallylactic> @AngriestPat Yes
[1:24:46] <Djinnazz> yes.
[1:24:46] <%eveningmars> nope
[1:24:46] <haiku0kami> We must GUN HARDER!
[1:24:47] <+YabbaTroll> NAH
[1:24:48] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you have to steal the drill once, now you can buy it on future runs
[1:24:48] <+thetruewaifu> nah
[1:24:48] <$googleygareth> Depends on your resources
[1:24:49] <%Jpdodds> Yeah, pretty much
[1:24:49] <lloyddboy> sure
[1:24:49] <kvnmck94> if you can survive 100%
[1:24:49] <%TokyoCosmos> unless youre decked out
[1:24:50] <+321Continue> nah
[1:24:50] <$Mendin> Oubliette yes, Abbey HELL NO
[1:24:50] <+Shaggnar> yes
[1:24:51] <eldritchmoeblob> USUALLY
[1:24:51] <%NovaKnightmare> Depends
[1:24:51] <%DeepFryedLogic> suzuku
[1:24:52] <+SpecialKei> yes
[1:24:52] <+Crippl3> If you're good on health and guns yes
[1:24:52] <SilverInferno3> Maybe
[1:24:52] <%AbnormalVoid> boobliete
[1:24:53] <$Bncbck> @Sora20030c my lord those missions go on long
[1:24:53] <natertot1> if you got the keys for it
[1:24:53] <p3nguin32> not always, no
[1:24:54] <benjiFG> i didn't even know that was a thing
[1:24:55] <%Fidel_Castbro> not right now
[1:24:55] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat how does it feel to know that at every con Eyepatch Wolf goes to stories will be told of how much a scrub you are at third strike?
[1:24:55] <lloyddboy> NOT THE CATHEDRAL NO
[1:24:56] <Rincewind1998> Depends on if you have a good room-clearer
[1:24:56] <SwindlerOfProgress> Ehhh. I rarely ever do.
[1:24:56] <kvnmck94> its more items than otherwise
[1:24:57] <+Sheepwalk> Yeaaaah... no
[1:24:57] <Dapper_Cactuar> depends on how many keys you have
[1:24:58] <Revan122800> who?
[1:24:58] <SaltyAzteca> @AngriestPat Not really
[1:25:01] <superbla25> if you can do it well yea
[1:25:04] <%eveningmars> Do Oubliette and its followup literally once
[1:25:04] <%Fidel_Castbro> maybe once you've killed the past with everyone
[1:25:06] <the_sprankton> if you have a decent chance of survival, the oubliette is worth it but the one after is not
[1:25:07] <+Order_of_Mystery> The Oubliette's boss gives you no bonuses for not getting hit, just an FYI
[1:25:07] <energywarning> Only if you're confident you can kill old king
[1:25:07] <%Sora20030c> @Bncbck the last one was straight up 40 minutes of turtling on the objective
[1:25:10] <%eveningmars> and never again unless you're doing really well
[1:25:10] <%PinkSuprende> Oubliette yes, the boss is a pushover. Other secret levels, depends on your survivability and DPS
[1:25:10] <rufus2k2> Oubliette is extra cash and weapons, especially if you're using the pilot
[1:25:11] <SwindlerOfProgress> The Abbey is only worth finishing ONCE.
[1:25:11] <+SpecialKei> depends if you have a good gun already
[1:25:12] <SaltyAzteca> @AngriestPat Unless you want to go to the secret chamber
[1:25:14] <%GarbageNirvana> I've been to the abbey once, the old king thoroughly kicked my ass
[1:25:16] <lloyddboy> lamp is good shit
[1:25:17] <+thetruewaifu> oh shit the jojo lamp
[1:25:21] <Pointdot> Kind of? It's a huge detour either way.
[1:25:27] <DLN002> It's not just the abbey, it's The Abbey of THE TRUE GUN
[1:25:27] <$Mendin> One, Two, Three, HAIL @ U
[1:25:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> was that the mario rpg coin noise?
[1:25:32] <+pixelkenj> I imagine the ammo drain of doing an extra stage is a problem
[1:25:37] <+NiktenKing> It is cause Blobulord is basically a free kill, but it's really only worth because of the secret
[1:25:37] <+LiquidXFire> DUCT TAPE is GODTIER @AngriestPat
[1:25:39] <+Sheepwalk> Why is he so fast wtf
[1:25:41] <ShaggyHighlander> I always end up getting myself killed trying to use the item you unlock from abbey LUL
[1:25:53] <%TokyoCosmos> @Sheepwalk turbo mode speed sup out of combat
[1:25:55] <%Sora20030c> Pat is much better than me at this game damn
[1:25:56] <%PinkSuprende> Pat keeps checking chests for mimics without any Curse...
[1:26:01] <kylejefferies> !uptime
[1:26:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 26m 3s.
[1:26:02] <+Sheepwalk> Ahhh ok
[1:26:05] <DLN002> Bloodied Scarf is real good once you git gud with it though
[1:26:12] <+NiktenKing> This isn't turbo though
[1:26:15] <%GarbageNirvana> So do those statues serve any purpose or
[1:26:19] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat secrets are usually in dead ends, shops and treasure rooms
[1:26:22] <+NiktenKing> this is normal with out of combat speed turned up
[1:26:34] <%TokyoCosmos> does huntress have higher movement speed naturally, i never noticed
[1:26:38] <DLN002> @PinkSuprende do mimics not appear without curse? I'm pretty sure I've gotten mimics without curse
[1:26:38] <$Bncbck> @Sora20030c i mean they're worth it, but hot damn, i had to play solo jus so i had the power of pause to go do something else inbetween
[1:26:38] <+demoncleanr> turbo mode speeds up EVERYTHING out of combat speedup is an option in the menu
[1:26:48] <%PinkSuprende> Its like less than 1%
[1:26:50] <VritraReiRei> @GarbageNirvana just decoration
[1:26:50] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> GUN GAME
[1:26:51] <+Order_of_Mystery> @NiktenKing he turned the out of combat speed up in the options menu
[1:26:54] <+thetruewaifu> shell is best weapon
[1:27:00] <kylejefferies> @niktenking Potentially, they added an option toake oit of combat speed.faster.
[1:27:00] <+TheShal> What about the knight?
[1:27:12] <%Sora20030c> @Bncbck I feel yah, I was listening to stream in background then it broke apatFist
[1:27:15] <Mr_Strut> Sadly turbo does not increase firing or reload speed.
[1:27:16] <Lazaruz95> Gungeon is the essence of Detroit 2nd gig. Everything is gun
[1:27:18] <+NiktenKing> I said.. that
[1:27:21] <%Jpdodds> @TheShal He has a sword forged of bullets
[1:27:33] <deviljhojho94> BANG BANG BANG
[1:27:33] <%Sora20030c> I miss stream
[1:27:40] <+NiktenKing> can people even read anymore?
[1:27:47] <natebud> It ridiculous how easy to avoid those big guys are. You can just run around them in a circle.
[1:27:53] <+Onlysamfisher > did pat eat paige?
[1:28:02] <eldritchmoeblob> yes
[1:28:03] <Opsbuscus> Yes
[1:28:04] <the_sprankton> was that chest locked? shitty reward
[1:28:09] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat fun fact, your doggo will bark if a chest is a mimic
[1:28:10] <%cerass> every night
[1:28:11] <+ArchimerDreatect> @AngriestPat isnt Hunter's Doggo meant to yap if its a mimic chest?
[1:28:11] <Kipss> good luck, rainbow chests are stupid rare
[1:28:15] <Djinnazz> Good luck ever seeing a rainbow chest.
[1:28:21] <%GarbageNirvana> I've seen one maybe once
[1:28:27] <+NiktenKing> Get a glitch chest
[1:28:28] <MunaMuna9> rainbow chests are like 1 in 100 runs
[1:28:29] <Lazaruz95> Paige wouldnt let Pat have candy so he ate her
[1:28:31] <+James_Quivers> @AngriestPat Does this game ranking blue chests BELOW green in power fuck with you as much as it does for me, coming off of WoW?
[1:28:31] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat brown chest have a SMALL CHANCE to actually be Rainbow
[1:28:31] <Kipss> ironically though, ive seen two in one of my very first playthroughd
[1:28:35] <Dapper_Cactuar> there is a glitch chest that has a less than 1% chance of spawning
[1:28:35] <SwindlerOfProgress> I've played for like 200 hours and have gotten ONE rainbow chest.
[1:28:36] <Opsbuscus> He thought she was the Venus de Milo
[1:28:46] <+NiktenKing> I really wanna see Pat get a glitch chest
[1:28:50] <kvnmck94> 2 keys doe
[1:28:57] <ScrapSentinel> Rainbow chests have a 0.0333% chance to replace a regular chest. Chests found upon clearing a room have a 0.001% chance to become a rainbow chest in addition to the normal 0.0333% chance.
[1:28:58] <DLN002> I've gotten glitch chests thrice. But only ever on floor 1 and 2 when it's near impossible to beat
[1:28:59] <$Mendin> DID U KNOW: If you have broken at least 1 Brown Chest on a run, the rest of the brown chests have an additional roll to secretly be Rainbow Chests Painted Brown?
[1:29:05] <knomad2b> i have seen one rainbow chest and it was on a short fuse so it blew up on me...
[1:29:06] <Dapper_Cactuar> glitch chests have you fight a glitched boss for double boss rewards
[1:29:08] <DLN002> did beat it once though
[1:29:18] <natebud> Ive got 115 hours and ive never seen a rainbow chest.
[1:29:26] <CptOverkill> @Mendin is that true?
[1:29:28] <WaxWitch> can they? yes, do they? probably not
[1:29:30] <%Remery_> Does the little corgi give buffs?

[1:31:02] <+shawntk_> sounds like a quitter to me
[1:31:02] <$Mendin> @kujofire990 Clearly it's Gatling Gull, legally distinct
[1:31:09] <Alseid> Shouldn't have tried
[1:31:09] <%Remery_> Oh man don't let his corkscrew penis touch you
[1:31:14] <Pair_oTits> gull's a real asshole when you don't get any guns
[1:31:21] <SirFailsAlott> I love vulcan raven
[1:31:23] <mayorrev> crazy talk
[1:31:27] <$Mendin> Pat's methodology in life: "Set the goalpost low, and then give up"
[1:31:30] <Rincewind1998> Honestly I find Gull to be the hardest Floor 1 boss by far. His pattern is just slightly off for me to roll through consistently.

[1:32:27] <%TokyoCosmos> JUNKEN
[1:32:28] <the_sprankton> probably wants to go to oubliette
[1:32:43] <yuribo26> @levitheshark everything, and i mean EVERYTHING in this game is a reference

[1:32:49] <$Piemono> Will the Pox cannon kill the fire?
[1:32:50] <+Griffin1171> I got to my first credits with junken
[1:32:50] <TranquilTurnip> 4 blue chests on first level IS luck
[1:32:58] <lvllvl9> if he's got junken before its only a 5% chance
[1:33:00] <VritraReiRei> 20% chance LUL
[1:33:01] <Eresus> 5% chance
[1:33:05] <+DespondentSloth> your junk son will become so strong once he spawns, though
[1:33:06] <$magikestral> pat have you gotten junken before
[1:33:08] <%TokyoCosmos> luck wasted in vain
[1:33:09] <Dapper_Cactuar> Sir Junken is the hero we need and deserve
[1:33:13] <FlipsVsTheWorld> @Rincewind1998 I out of the loop . Who's Casey?
[1:33:14] <%Fidel_Castbro> I got Junken with 3 Junk upgrades on the first floor before
[1:33:16] <%TokyoCosmos> hopefully you pick up the trashcannon
[1:33:17] <%Fidel_Castbro> it was neat
[1:33:21] <Djinnazz> sir junkin doesn't come from destroying chests anymore @AngriestPat
[1:33:21] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat junkan is only a 5% spawn after you've unlocked him :(
[1:33:22] <$Mendin> I got Maximum Power Junkman and Familiar Clone
[1:33:26] <$Mendin> It was OBSCENE
[1:33:38] <+NiktenKing> I remember the pre-patch loading in every room with chests and I was frothing at the prospect of getting Junken on floor 1
[1:33:55] <+Crippl3> @NiktenKing dude, it ruled, pilot was so OP lol
[1:33:58] <$Mendin> Oh and I was Robit so I too was getting Junk Power
[1:33:59] <ThDark> I had no idea Junkan could get so strong, I feel like I fool not feeding him chests when I get him
[1:34:13] <axelkaspar> WOW
[1:34:20] <$Mendin> I got Command0 floor 1 and then Junkan so I went "Yeah screw it BREAK EVERY CHEST"
[1:34:31] <%TokyoCosmos> you can do it
[1:34:33] <+NWR_James> inb4 "way worse"
[1:34:37] <Rincewind1998> @FlipsVsTheWorld Casey is one of the best weapons in the game, but it hasa way lower rarity than it deserves so you can get it in blue chests.
[1:34:39] <+NiktenKing> Junken gets so strong that he will literally save your life and let you have a continue
[1:34:52] <$Mendin> And then he gets stronger
[1:35:02] <ThDark> What's the pig companion? I love that his description changes
[1:35:09] <+QuietWyatt211> if he gets too strong, he wont save your life
[1:35:13] <$Mendin> Pig companion The Hero Pig
[1:35:17] <SubjectX07x> He’s a secret serviceman
[1:35:24] <SubjectX07x> ;)
[1:35:26] <+NiktenKing> But at that point do you need to be saved?
[1:35:29] <$Mendin> the Pig is secretly THE BABY
[1:35:36] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> The elmo
[1:35:36] <Dapper_Cactuar> fun fact: the language that the merchant you can't understand uses is from futurama
[1:35:43] <natebud> Sir Junkan + Gold Junk is unreal. Gives him an exosuit
[1:35:52] <+QuietWyatt211> I wouldve liked that second chance when I fought the lich the first time
[1:35:52] <$Piemono> I love the synergies they added with the patch
[1:35:52] <$Mendin> If you have the Heroine charge cannon it literally becomes End Of Super Metroid if the pig dies
[1:35:56] <FlipsVsTheWorld> @Rincewind1998 LUL Like I said MY RNG fucks more over way more. Rather then being useful or lucky
[1:35:56] <+YabbaTroll> eww
[1:35:58] <VritraReiRei> @Rincewind1998 Casey is Brown, D tier
[1:36:05] <lvllvl9> gross

[1:36:21] <Rincewind1998> Light gun is a great boss killer
[1:36:22] <+thetruewaifu> gold junkan is op he gets homing missiles and a heck gun
[1:36:28] <+Alzero83> Are there Hidden walls? Is that why your doing that @AngriestPat ?
[1:36:41] <$Mendin> There are, yes
[1:36:42] <PakuV2> Infinite Range
[1:36:42] <yuribo26> @alzero83 yea
[1:36:48] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder if they actually get to call it the zapper in the Switch version
[1:36:49] <+Alzero83> Shit i didnt know that
[1:36:50] <$Piemono> There are also Mimic walls
[1:37:04] <randomp141> @AngriestPat hold it up to a turned on lamp and you'll hit everything in the room
[1:37:05] <Pair_oTits> you can chip them with non-starting guns and then use a blank to open them
[1:37:08] <+Order_of_Mystery> @Piemono excuse me what?
[1:37:12] <lloyddboy> stop reloading it
[1:37:13] <ThDark> Mimic walls?? This game
[1:37:14] <eldritchmoeblob> i thought people just rubbed on walls to make woolie vomit

[1:37:43] <$Piemono> @Order_of_Mystery If you shoot/touch a wall sometimes they will be a mimic wall
[1:37:51] <DLN002> there are some really good synergies in this game, they either reference something or make the existing reference EVEN STRONGER
[1:37:53] <energywarning> You should only check for secrets after the boss so you can save thE blanks for potential master rounds
[1:37:53] <+thetruewaifu> wait is door lord a floor 4 or 3 boss because i have never fought him
[1:37:58] <thelonechris> Unwashed shirts
[1:38:01] <$Piemono> 3rd?

[1:38:15] <tacostarvedbeast> @AngriestPat they got them from smash tourney palyers

[1:39:02] <$Piemono> The worse thing about mimic walls is that they give you nothing
[1:39:16] <+NiktenKing> Bomb synergy is also pretty good
[1:39:21] <$Piemono> It feels like it breaks mimic rules or something

[1:40:14] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> everything can be a mimic except for tables and enemies
[1:40:17] <SubjectX07x> There's also a mimic companion.
[1:40:20] <$Mendin> It locks your weapon until you pick up an ammo crate,. and any bullets you shoot with it turn into Jammed Bullets
[1:40:21] <SubjectX07x> Baby good mimic.
[1:40:27] <eldritchmoeblob> is the guneoneer a mimic

[1:44:28] <%PinkSuprende> When does The Bullet start hanging out, after the first Dragun kill?
[1:44:30] <yarazunoamezzz> I tried this game but it is a little too much for me, Isaac is more my speed
[1:44:36] <kvnmck94> ehh, marines passive is still good.
[1:44:36] <+Crippl3> thsi game is mad hard
[1:44:39] <SubjectX07x> After the first past clear I believe.
[1:44:47] <+Retrash> did you get any cool synergies yet?
[1:44:49] <sirrice77> Yeah bullet is after past clear for one character
[1:44:50] <kvnmck94> how bad you want it!?
[1:44:53] <%Jpdodds> Yr

[1:44:57] <%Fidel_Castbro> yes
[1:44:57] <+thetruewaifu> yes
[1:44:58] <+KorlaNeumono> I didn't realize Pat was the worst at this game
[1:44:58] <stratfel112> no
[1:44:58] <Rincewind1998> keys are always worth it
[1:44:59] <+Weeewer> 2 damage for 1 key
[1:44:59] <+Crippl3> ima say no
[1:45:00] <kylejefferies> @pinksuprende Nope.
[1:45:02] <+KorlaNeumono> But I'm glad to discover that fact
[1:45:02] <+Crippl3> but close
[1:45:04] <+NiktenKing> Yes you can always get hp
[1:45:04] <DLN002> I'd trade a full heart for a key any day
[1:45:04] <kvnmck94> no dmg woulda been better, but id trade that
[1:45:07] <+yetionayacht> @PinkSuprende You gotta gather components then the forge girl alwyas give it to you
[1:45:08] <lethallylactic> Use the crossbow you maniac
[1:45:09] <+thetruewaifu> 2 damage for one blue chest
[1:45:12] <Eresus> it took my like 40h of game time until I felt like I've become better
[1:45:16] <Rincewind1998> OH SHIT
[1:45:16] <%Jpdodds> YE
[1:45:17] <kvnmck94> HP loss is fine, just dont get hit again
[1:45:17] <%TokyoCosmos> niceeee
[1:45:20] <%Fidel_Castbro> eh you'd more likely get a heart drop then a key
[1:45:21] <$Mendin> It wasnt w orth it because you didnt crossbow to get good but otherwie ye
[1:45:23] <Rincewind1998> That's a good-ass gun
[1:45:23] <$Piemono> Pat's definitely killed all the friendly bullets he's come across
[1:45:23] <%GarbageNirvana> dag
[1:45:23] <+NiktenKing> Winchester my olde friend
[1:45:25] <%TokyoCosmos> just crossbow these fools
[1:45:25] <Pair_oTits> and that's why brown chests aren't shit
[1:45:25] <kvnmck94> YEAH love that gun
[1:45:25] <%PinkSuprende> @yetionayacht The Bullet, not The Bullet. Lmao.
[1:45:31] <tacostarvedbeast> nice thatll carry you through a couple of floors
[1:45:32] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Y'know the dog barks at mimics right?
[1:45:32] <%Typhaeon> Winchester is one of my faves
[1:45:33] <%TokyoCosmos> winchester rifle is godlike
[1:45:33] <%Mr_y1096> winchester rifles are the shit irl
[1:45:34] <+Weeewer> its strong tho
[1:45:38] <+NiktenKing> It's just a better bowgun
[1:45:38] <+D3rrtyD4n> yup
[1:45:40] <kvnmck94> the best fukn rifle
[1:45:40] <SubjectX07x> It's aight.
[1:45:41] <+NiktenKing> yes
[1:45:41] <+Crippl3> It's good
[1:45:41] <Djinnazz> it's ok.
[1:45:42] <%TokyoCosmos> two shots A LOT
[1:45:43] <%Jpdodds> its good
[1:45:44] <+yetionayacht> @PinkSuprende whu
[1:45:45] <tacostarvedbeast> accurate and decent damage so yes
[1:45:45] <kvnmck94> how dare you even ask
[1:45:45] <TheImmortal70> Good room clear
[1:45:45] <+Retrash> good early
[1:45:47] <lethallylactic> It's good on lower floors.
[1:45:48] <+mechokk> how have you never gotten the winchester?
[1:45:48] <+thetruewaifu> gun good
[1:45:50] <SaltyAzteca> Its a room clearer
[1:45:56] <ShamanKing0811> For a brown chest yes
[1:45:56] <$BuoyantSoul> It’s good
[1:45:56] <+mechokk> its like one of the most common weapons its great for early on
[1:45:58] <SwindlerOfProgress> Decent
[1:45:58] <SaltyAzteca> and a boss killer
[1:46:01] <Senselessvirus> Winchester is good on bosses
[1:46:01] <+Matto424> I mean it's a Winchester those are like classic
[1:46:02] <Rincewind1998> Hits hard, big magazine, and is super accurate
[1:46:03] <alcors_wisdom> repeater rifles are good irl
[1:46:03] <Dapper_Cactuar> @PinkSuprende to unlock the bullet, after beating the game find bullets with red capes. They will not attack you and if you don't kill them they will eventually leave. do this 5 times to unlock the bullet
[1:46:05] <+mechokk> with bullet modifiers its amazing
[1:46:08] <+Weeewer> its accurate
[1:46:09] <+gropezero> winchester is great
[1:46:09] <+xGnarlyCharlie> holy shit iam actually getting to see pat stream live for once! good game too
[1:46:10] <+Crippl3> better than the crossbow IMO
[1:46:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> pat "is this the meta?" boivin
[1:46:11] <+Weeewer> doesnt deviate much
[1:46:14] <Ser_Randal> PAT DUMB
[1:46:14] <SubjectX07x> @AngriestPat Dynamite bois are great for killing off other enemies.
[1:46:17] <alextrebeken> no paige?
[1:46:22] <+D3rrtyD4n> see how it is on bosses
[1:46:23] <MarylandJutsu> so how many tries has pat been through?
[1:46:25] <%GarbageNirvana> The lower the ammo, the better the gun
[1:46:29] <%Ninestempest> I think Paige is working
[1:46:30] <%GarbageNirvana> I thought this was established
[1:46:32] <%TokyoCosmos> pieces up bosses
[1:46:33] <%PinkSuprende> Oh i've beat this game back to front and cleared every past, I just forget when stuff becomes findable. Trying to gauge where Pat's at.
[1:46:34] <CptBritches> Ammo go down
[1:46:36] <$Piemono> I think Paige is dead
[1:46:44] <$Mendin> "Ammo is low" he says when it's a rapidfire crossbow damagewise
[1:46:46] <+yetionayacht> all guns are just faster crossbows if you think about it
[1:46:47] <+D3rrtyD4n> i miss paige FeelsBadMan
[1:46:49] <$BuoyantSoul> Ammos low, he says before shooting a wall
[1:47:00] <%TokyoCosmos> open
[1:47:02] <%TokyoCosmos> ON A ROLL
[1:47:02] <+Weeewer> lol
[1:47:04] <happyface699> Bullet sad
[1:47:14] <kylejefferies> When was the last Peach or Elmo sighting?
[1:47:24] <+Weeewer> why would you not open a chest
[1:47:27] <+Weeewer> is there a mechanic i dont know
[1:47:30] <+NiktenKing> @AngriestPat Corgiboi borks at mimics
[1:47:31] <+XxBTExX> no clue
[1:47:32] <+yetionayacht> keys are limited
[1:47:32] <kvnmck94> brown chests often give heart/key/blank on open. its pretty worth tbh
[1:47:33] <$Mendin> need 2 keys to open the Oubliette
[1:47:33] <SubjectX07x> Because it could waste keys over better ones.
[1:47:35] <%cerass> roll over tiny slimes to kill @angriestpat
[1:47:36] <$Piemono> Someone needs to get Paige's face on a milk carton
[1:47:39] <+Weeewer> gotcha
[1:47:39] <SubjectX07x> Or going there.
[1:47:40] <+Crippl3> @Weeewer color of the chest determines the quality of the item inside
[1:47:41] <kylejefferies> keys are limited.
[1:47:44] <+yetionayacht> why does he wanna go to oubby land
[1:47:46] <ELuscious> did a new DLC come out? Everybody is playing this
[1:47:46] <+XxBTExX> Pat hates upgrades confirmed
[1:47:46] <+Weeewer> Well why not open the brown one
[1:47:48] <tacostarvedbeast> winchester should be enough for first floor boss
[1:47:50] <+Weeewer> or did he and I didnt notice
[1:47:54] <SubjectX07x> Brown chests are lowest tier.
[1:47:57] <Huntercd> Is Paige MIA?
[1:47:58] <kvnmck94> @ELuscious yes
[1:47:59] <+YabbaTroll> @ELuscious yep, a big one
[1:48:01] <$Piemono> @ELuscious New content Patch
[1:48:01] <+Crippl3> @ELuscious big update, Advanced Gungeons & Draguns, free
[1:48:04] <kylejefferies> @eluscious Advanced Gungeonss and Draguns
[1:48:05] <ELuscious> cool
[1:48:07] <+Weeewer> still worth an open? Unless it had a lock and I didnt notice
[1:48:08] <%thetruewaifu> how about you don't go down the ooble hole and instead you open chests
[1:48:09] <Eresus> @Weeewer brown chest usually have worst item
[1:48:09] <$Mendin> The one brown chest he got from a room clear drop was pre-unlocked
[1:48:11] <%GarbageNirvana> ...does
[1:48:13] <%TokyoCosmos> sniperrr
[1:48:15] <Rincewind1998> GET THE SNIPER
[1:48:15] <%TokyoCosmos> godlike
[1:48:16] <+Crippl3> Oooh, sniper rifle
[1:48:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Does the fireplace room always have a water barrel
[1:48:23] <+Yokuho> Man, I hope the Monster hunter world version on PC comes out with the Dante and Megaman outfits
[1:48:23] <+Crippl3> yeah
[1:48:23] <+NiktenKing> SNIPER RIFLE
[1:48:27] <+Castle_Kundarak> @GarbageNirvana No.
[1:48:30] <%TokyoCosmos> ssniper might make you want to skill oubliette
[1:48:30] <natebud> Sniper is pretty good
[1:48:30] <+yetionayacht> is there a reason to go to the oubliette other than more currency?
[1:48:31] <+Castle_Kundarak> But often it does.
[1:48:33] <+Retrash> @GarbageNirvana after you do it once, yes
[1:48:35] <+Elexius> noice
[1:48:36] <%TokyoCosmos> skip
[1:48:40] <Pair_oTits> it spawns with one after you've been to Oubliette once
[1:48:40] <deviljhojho94> idiort
[1:48:43] <SulfurousAcid> amazing
[1:48:47] <kvnmck94> brown chests are honestly still better than blue. they give hearts/key/blank almost everytime and can potentially be a hidden rainbow chest
[1:48:48] <+NiktenKing> To unlock secrets and free boss farm
[1:48:48] <+yetionayacht> idiort
[1:48:54] <%GarbageNirvana> How did I never notice
[1:48:58] <%cerass> @angriestpat roll over tiny slimes to kill
[1:49:00] <+NiktenKing> Blobulord is easy
[1:49:03] <+XxBTExX> Pat's getting old. His reaction time is getting slower.
[1:49:08] <+D3rrtyD4n> focus on one of them
[1:49:10] <TheImmortal70> Well it depends
[1:49:10] <deviljhojho94> bukD
[1:49:10] <$Piemono> Feel like Raven is easier
[1:49:13] <tacostarvedbeast> either these or the bird
[1:49:13] <%thetruewaifu> king is easiest
[1:49:13] <+Retrash> gull is easiest
[1:49:16] <Eresus> the twins are the easiest to me
[1:49:17] <Shadygamer31> @Yokuho it should, but you gotta wait for the event to appear, watch the event schedule for that
[1:49:17] <SubjectX07x> They're easy once learned, and you generally just focus one.
[1:49:18] <TheImmortal70> The gatling gull is easier as long as it's in the library
[1:49:18] <DLN002> trigger twins are ezpz
[1:49:19] <cerberuscarmine> its ya bois
[1:49:19] <EASrake> i find bullet king easiest
[1:49:20] <%TokyoCosmos> bu m rush one and the other one just follows you for the easy kiting
[1:49:20] <reonome> king is easiest
[1:49:21] <Pair_oTits> get one to half and then focus the other
[1:49:24] <+LegendCobra> for some reason I never got these
[1:49:24] <+NiktenKing> Easiest is king
[1:49:27] <sirrice77> im bad against gatling gull somehow
[1:49:27] <+LegendCobra> I always get the bird
[1:49:28] <+James_Quivers> Ornstein and Smough
[1:49:28] <MarylandJutsu> hey hey PAT GIT GUUUD
[1:49:32] <TheImmortal70> Easiest IS king
[1:49:34] <+Crippl3> aw dang
[1:49:34] <Rincewind1998> I'd say it goes Bullet King<Twins<Gull in terms of difficulty
[1:49:35] <SwindlerOfProgress> I have the most trouble not getting hit by them. Bullet King is the easiest.
[1:49:35] <Eresus> rip
[1:49:37] <+yetionayacht> NotLikeThis
[1:49:38] <%bluetocho13> king is the hardest

[1:53:05] <$Mendin> Go back to Nuclear Throne like a casul
[1:53:06] <Kaltmj> How many floors are even in the game? This seems so hard to beat
[1:53:06] <%cerass> @angriestpat roll over mini slimes to kill for free

[1:53:14] <QaizerArt> @AngriestPat just stop being bad at the game, pat
[1:53:17] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat how does it feel to know that at every con Eyepatch Wolf goes to stories will be told of how much a scrub you are at third strike?
[1:53:18] <%CJW_042> apatWhat

[1:53:21] <+bonzosan> ha, pat said poopulon
[1:53:21] <Louie_Salmon> Oublette is scary, I basically never go for it
[1:53:21] <+XxBTExX> Go down the Woolie hole, get shit on.
[1:53:30] <Rincewind1998> @Order_of_Mystery yes, especially during bosses, since they're so big you can just aim in their general direction
[1:53:32] <eldritchmoeblob> smash those pots like link woulda done
[1:53:32] <SubjectX07x> I shoot them with.. the force I guess lol?

[1:53:51] <Kaltmj> @Mendin oof
[1:53:51] <benjiFG> how rare are glitch chests?
[1:53:53] <Mr_Strut> It's like he has a deficit of attention
[1:53:56] <SubjectX07x> Exceedingly.
[1:54:00] <%fredan31> should i pick this up for the switch?
[1:54:01] <$Piemono> Really Rare
[1:54:06] <SubjectX07x> like, .01 chance
[1:54:09] <Louie_Salmon> As rare as it gets
[1:54:13] <+Crippl3> fuck ghosts
[1:54:13] <DLN002> played since the game launched, only ever got 3
[1:54:15] <$Piemono> Do you like bullet hells and rouge-likes?
[1:54:17] <$magikestral> @fredan31 as someone who put about 100 hours into it, yes
[1:54:19] <natebud> Rainbow are .0333
[1:54:19] <%GarbageNirvana> @fredan31 This game is amazing on the Switch
[1:54:19] <yuribo26> @benjifg 0,1% to appear
[1:54:19] <+Retrash> only rainbow is rarer than glitch
[1:54:28] <tacostarvedbeast> should just use up the cross bow on floor one, should be replacing it by the anyways
[1:54:30] <VritraReiRei> @benjiFG .1%
[1:54:31] <blonde7000> Get it pat, get it
[1:54:31] <%GarbageNirvana> It has a bit more slowdown than on the other systems tho
[1:54:33] <Rincewind1998> Ol' reliable
[1:54:33] <DLN002> oooh, I likey regular shotty
[1:54:40] <%thetruewaifu> slide along the tables
[1:54:40] <+Retrash> crossbow is good on floors 1 and 2
[1:54:41] <+wingblade7> Hi pat!
[1:54:41] <Rincewind1998> Seriously, that gun is so good
[1:54:43] <$Mendin> I am personally a bigger fan of the PC version for easier aiming and, more importantly, scrollwheel eweapon changing
[1:54:43] <SubjectX07x> And frankly I'd in most cases rather have anything than a glitched chest.
[1:54:44] <Pair_oTits> shotty is 👌
[1:54:46] <+Retrash> after that it's bad
[1:54:48] <%fredan31> @magikestral thanks
[1:54:49] <SubjectX07x> Dual beholsters is hell.
[1:54:49] <Cosairen> regular shotgun is a waifu
[1:54:50] <thelonechris> Look at those idiots with their non-regular shotguns
[1:54:57] <Eresus> hahaha
[1:54:58] <StooEsq> Regular-Ass Shotgun is good for how regular it is
[1:54:59] <%Fidel_Castbro> I just had a run with the regular shotgun and AK synergy
[1:54:59] <Dovakhin573> So whats the point of the crypt hidden floor?
[1:55:04] <Rincewind1998> The regular shotgun is better than 70% of the other shotguns
[1:55:04] <%fredan31> @GarbageNirvana thanks
[1:55:08] <%Typhaeon> You stored a heart, it's fine
[1:55:11] <SubjectX07x> Another secret extra floor with a boss.
[1:55:16] <Ser_Randal> Calm down stupid
[1:55:17] <%TokyoCosmos> bad shop yuck
[1:55:21] <+GingerTwerk213> Pat stop talking
[1:55:24] <DLN002> @Dovakhin573 more money, more chests
[1:55:27] <SubjectX07x> Though the crypt one's pretty hard compared to blobulon.
[1:55:30] <lloyddboy> get the GOLD
[1:55:33] <latgeek> seeking the GUN
[1:55:34] <kvnmck94> Ammolets are much better in this patch due to synergies
[1:55:37] <heytakeiteasyterry> @AngriestPat I feel matt is the cooler best friend in the group and yall gonna do shitstorm this year i hope
[1:55:45] <kvnmck94> still not worth the moneyz
[1:55:51] <%ymorn> lol
[1:55:51] <Dovakhin573> Yeah the old king is a piece of shit got lucky and beat him in my first try
[1:55:51] <p3nguin32> knife shield pretty good
[1:55:57] <+LegendCobra> oh that's what you do in the fireplace rooms?
[1:55:57] <%thetruewaifu> stop going in the ooble holse
[1:55:58] <%Ninestempest> @heytakeiteasyterry they do a shitstorm literlaly every year
[1:56:01] <ELuscious> :)
[1:56:02] <%TokyoCosmos> ammolet havbe synergy
[1:56:03] <%thetruewaifu> hole*
[1:56:03] <+Nilbop> All I can focus on is this goddamn dog.
[1:56:09] <%cerass> roll over tinyslimes to kill
[1:56:14] <SubjectX07x> Knife shield= spinning circle of one hit blocks.
[1:56:15] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat knife shield is leaf shield from mega man
[1:56:15] <tacostarvedbeast> meh its fine, its no time stop or back hole
[1:56:16] <Pair_oTits> knife shield makes a circle of knives that block bullets
[1:56:17] <DLN002> knife shield's a vergil summoned sword active
[1:56:17] <PrimeDork> Does he have "Faster outside of combat" on?
[1:56:21] <kvnmck94> increases blank dmg
[1:56:26] <AJusticeLemon> gives blanks effects
[1:56:26] <RetributionP> What is this pat! I just watched the old gungeon video yesterday. I'm freaking out. NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:56:26] <DLN002> launch it for more damage
[1:56:28] <%thetruewaifu> make the fucking bullet dammit
[1:56:28] <+Elexius> look in your ammonomicon
[1:56:30] <+Retrash> way more blank damage and 1 more blank per floor
[1:56:36] <%TokyoCosmos> AND A BLANK EACH FLOOR
[1:56:38] <Louie_Salmon> I don't ever like buying active items
[1:56:42] <Kipss> it increases it to 60, which is stupid high, and more blanks per floor
[1:56:44] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat it also gives you a 3rd blank every floor
[1:56:52] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat and one additional blank per floor
[1:56:52] <Joller2> is there any hard progress in this game?
[1:57:05] <+pixelkenj> can it nuke a room?
[1:57:06] <+mugwugsampoo> @joller2 yes but slow
[1:57:07] <%TokyoCosmos> @Joller2 yes
[1:57:07] <kvnmck94> well, cuz it doesnt rllly atm. with that it can clear a fucked bad room for you
[1:57:07] <$Piemono> Just guns/items/characters
[1:57:07] <p3nguin32> creates a shield of knives around you. charges pretty quickly and can stack to create a big ring of knives
[1:57:09] <Pair_oTits> you can make shortcuts to later floors
[1:57:12] <SubjectX07x> Depends what's in the room.
[1:57:12] <Louie_Salmon> The 3rd blank per floor is the main benefit of all ammolets
[1:57:20] <SubjectX07x> It'll nuke pretty much any lower tier enemies.
[1:57:21] <latgeek> Gungeon needs items that make your stock gun more fun, i m o.
[1:57:22] <%TokyoCosmos> @Joller2 it can snowball when you get really nice runs
[1:57:24] <DLN002> why stack the knives when you can launch them for big damage
[1:57:30] <$Mendin> Pat doesnt use blanks anyway so it's useless Kappa
[1:57:30] <tacostarvedbeast> you got a shootgun, your set to take up boss easy
[1:57:44] <SubjectX07x> Wait, you can launch the knife shield?
[1:57:50] <kvnmck94> ye
[1:57:54] <SubjectX07x> I literally never even knew that.
[1:57:55] <SubjectX07x> Waow
[1:57:58] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Did pat uninstall fortnite yet? Kappa
[1:58:11] <kvnmck94> every remaining knife goes out. not a ton of dmg, but, if theres too few to block anything its better
[1:58:16] <+Sheepwalk> @AngriestPat If you happen to get Fightsabre + Knife Shield, it creates a synergy in which throwing the knives is a one-shot for all enemies
[1:58:18] <DLN002> it's the vergil special
[1:58:22] <SubjectX07x> And to think I was going to focus on my Escape from Tarkov runs while listening to pat get memed on by gungeon.
[1:58:23] <p3nguin32> if i'm playing poorly, would rather have the shield block hits than risk it for damage
[1:58:27] <tacostarvedbeast> any point to the new statues since the update?
[1:58:33] <+Sheepwalk> Dunno if it was a bug they fixed or not
[1:58:34] <+Retrash> uh oh
[1:58:35] <+LegendCobra> why is he randomly shooting at walls
[1:58:38] <+Retrash> worst boss room
[1:58:44] <kvnmck94> this is gonna get him hit. too close range, no walls
[1:58:47] <Eresus> fuck this room
[1:58:49] <%DeepFryedLogic> why is pat so good at this game
[1:58:50] <SubjectX07x> This boss room is sooo bullshit.
[1:58:53] <diver__down> this arena sucks\
[1:58:59] <%DeepFryedLogic> look at him go hes unstopable
[1:59:00] <kylejefferies> @legendcobra Wall Mimics or Secret rooms.
[1:59:05] <+mugwugsampoo> RIP vulcans worst room
[1:59:06] <SubjectX07x> It's like the only stage I get hit on against this guy. :/
[1:59:08] <%TokyoCosmos> this arena makes his patterns so much harder
[1:59:23] <Louie_Salmon> This is probably the hardest room for him, yeah
[1:59:26] <%TokyoCosmos> iframes nice
[1:59:31] <+LegendCobra> nice nice
[1:59:34] <BakedBam> Hi pat and fuck you <3
[1:59:37] <%TokyoCosmos> ayyyyy
[1:59:38] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> really i thought it made him easier
[1:59:40] <GreatestGuess> Gull has so many room variations
[1:59:43] <DLN002> chaos is nice
[1:59:44] <+Sheepwalk> Do you guys prefer controller or mouse+kb for this game?
[1:59:45] <SubjectX07x> Randomized blank effect
[1:59:47] <%DeepFryedLogic> chaos
[1:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:49] <Louie_Salmon> It is nice how he gets stuck on the water though
[1:59:49] <AJusticeLemon> CHAOS LEGION
[1:59:50] <%DeepFryedLogic> controll
[1:59:52] <mayorrev> CHAOS CONTROL
[1:59:53] <%TokyoCosmos> just get the blank synergy!
[1:59:55] <kvnmck94> its better than it sounds, but, ye
[1:59:56] <+Retrash> AMMOLETS ARE GOOD
[1:59:56] <Djinnazz> Chaos is good.
[1:59:57] <+Crippl3> actually good tho
[2:00:02] <+LegendCobra> it literally chaos control
[2:00:03] <tacostarvedbeast> nice
[2:00:03] <%Otanojenkins> OHHHHH
[2:00:04] <kvnmck94> ooo not bad
[2:00:05] <%TokyoCosmos> rocket bullets lets go
[2:00:07] <+mugwugsampoo> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GODS
[2:00:08] <SubjectX07x> Oooh rocket bullets are nice.
[2:00:10] <+resstarr> Good trinket
[2:00:11] <sosuke5> I think you mean the chaos...emeralds
[2:00:14] <%TokyoCosmos> get the gold one and you have a godlike run
[2:00:16] <eldritchmoeblob> MORE ROCKET MEANS MORE FAST
[2:00:18] <VritraReiRei> KEY
[2:00:19] <kvnmck94> buy key and gold ammolet
[2:00:19] <+Elexius> Pat never uses his blanks so it doesnt matter :(
[2:00:19] <Pair_oTits> lotta heresy in this chat
[2:00:20] <%CJW_042> SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE
[2:00:20] <tacostarvedbeast> now if he gets heavy bullets he will hit like a truck
[2:00:21] <%TokyoCosmos> additional blank with gold!
[2:00:21] <+Quarkee> thats really good pat youre just bad at the game
[2:00:22] <Eresus> buy keys?
[2:00:23] <+Retrash> get the other ammolet 2 more blanks per floor
[2:00:25] <%GarbageNirvana> You could save for the primer
[2:00:27] <kylejefferies> Chaos Ammolet is a Reference to the Chaos enchantment in Skyrim.
[2:00:28] <StooEsq> that Oubliette is dismal, avoid it
[2:00:29] <kvnmck94> its better than you think
[2:00:30] <Kipss> you get an extra blank per floor per ammolet
[2:00:30] <DLN002> Knife shield's probably better
[2:00:30] <%Kurvera> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink
[2:00:31] <Djinnazz> Knife sheild
[2:00:44] <hntronium> KNIFE SHIELD
[2:00:44] <+Sheepwalk> knife shield is hella good too
[2:00:45] <kvnmck94> and then start actually using your fucking blanks
[2:00:46] <%thetruewaifu> its not like he uses them
[2:00:49] <tacostarvedbeast> can always use more keys pat
[2:00:50] <FlipsVsTheWorld> So, blue chests have rarer items/guns then green chest? Or, is it viceversa?
[2:00:50] <Kipss> 2 more blanks per floor + random effects + huge damage is pretty good
[2:00:51] <VritraReiRei> get key
[2:00:51] <Louie_Salmon> I forgot how good Gungeon music is, I've been listening to the TMS playthrough in the background of it
[2:00:51] <natebud> Knife shield adds curse tho
[2:00:52] <yandereboyfriend> All ammolets give an extra blank
[2:00:52] <%TokyoCosmos> you cna nuke almost anyfloor if chaos wants you too
[2:00:53] <kylejefferies> Ammolets give you more blanks per floor.
[2:00:57] <+NiktenKing> knife shield

[2:04:46] <Rincewind1998> Thompson is probably up there for best machine guns in this game
[2:04:46] <SubjectX07x> Gnawed key is rat boss, but there's more to it.

[2:05:38] <SubjectX07x> Well, small amount unless you are THE B U L L E T
[2:05:38] <Pair_oTits> not worth for anyone but the bullet to begin with tho
[2:05:40] <pectusumbra> Now, question: does this game have modding? Can we get Elmo in?
[2:05:41] <CNExoSoul> you mean bullets?

[2:11:56] <Djinnazz> YOU COMPLETELY FORgot about your lead skin.
[2:12:00] <QaizerArt> @AngriestPat Five O'Clock Somewhere - If the player also has Crestfaller, reloading it will fire a glass bottle that has a chance to stun enemies hit
[2:12:02] <zazzera01> reloading fires a glass bottle
[2:12:03] <%Fidel_Castbro> it fires a bottle
[2:12:04] <+Order_of_Mystery> If the player also has Shotga Cola, Shotgun Coffee, Double Vision, Potion of Gun Friendship, Potion of Lead Skin, or Old Knight's Flask, reloading will fire a glass bottle that has a chance to stun enemies hit.
[2:12:04] <reonome> he used the lead skin once
[2:12:04] <+Retrash> nah he used it @Djinnazz
[2:12:04] <pectusumbra> no, he used it a few times
[2:12:04] <kvnmck94> @AngriestPat your reload hits em with glass
[2:12:05] <PrimeDork> "Reloading will fire a glass bottle that will stun enemies it hits."
[2:12:05] <AJusticeLemon> reload the gun
[2:12:08] <natebud> Reload tosses a knife
[2:12:08] <%Typhaeon> I wish my stand was Robin Williams's Genie
[2:12:09] <MunaMuna9> when you reload it shoot a bottle that stuns and bleeds
[2:12:10] <Djinnazz> oh nvm.
[2:12:10] <Rincewind1998> Hard hitter that freezes enemies, syngergy throws a stunning bottle on reload
[2:12:12] <%TokyoCosmos> itll shoot an extra projectile
[2:12:13] <+XxBTExX> "Freezes enemy. What does it do?" Pat 2018

[2:13:53] <Alseid> What does he do?
[2:13:54] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Lament Configurum is fucking nuts
[2:13:59] <+mugwugsampoo> DICE sumHassan
[2:14:01] <+NWR_James> Crazy Talk struck quick
[2:14:01] <kvnmck94> did you want your run to be even more ruined by RNG? here you go
[2:14:01] <+resstarr> he's more or less challenge mode but its the the luck that counts
[2:14:02] <SubjectX07x> Basically he activates fuck you mode.
[2:14:03] <Skitsoguy> Hello everyone
[2:14:04] <%thetruewaifu> he randomizes your run or something
[2:14:09] <GPAlpha> CRAZY TALK
[2:14:11] <%thetruewaifu> just fucks it up
[2:14:12] <TheImmortal70> Random effects every room
[2:14:12] <Rincewind1998> I hate that NPC
[2:14:15] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Daisuke unlocks challenge mode, which gives you random modifiers on every room and special ones on bosses for an entire run
[2:14:20] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's fucked
[2:14:21] <Rincewind1998> Blessed runs are fun, he just makes it stupid
[2:14:25] <Dani_el_Dani> @Skitsoguy hello
[2:14:25] <SubliminaIMessages> o chin chin ga daisuke nan dayo
[2:14:27] <kvnmck94> decent
[2:14:27] <Djinnazz> good.
[2:14:28] <VritraReiRei> BAD
[2:14:28] <%TokyoCosmos> good damage
[2:14:30] <Huntercd> Daisuke? The guy from Guilty Gear?
[2:14:30] <+NiktenKing> It's good cause freeeeeeeeeeze
[2:14:30] <+Retrash> lamp is better
[2:14:31] <%thetruewaifu> alright
[2:14:31] <kvnmck94> not great
[2:14:32] <TheImmortal70> It freezes bosses
[2:14:33] <%TokyoCosmos> not the best
[2:14:33] <tacostarvedbeast> great at start since its freezes
[2:14:33] <Rincewind1998> Crestfaller is good for all situations
[2:14:33] <SubjectX07x> It's aight, but seriously just use the genie lamp.
[2:14:34] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> good and slows them down
[2:14:34] <energywarning> it's more of a room clearer
[2:14:36] <lethallylactic> Chill is pretty good
[2:14:36] <+Retrash> use crestfaller for rooms
[2:14:36] <kvnmck94> lamps better by far
[2:14:36] <+NiktenKing> Makes bosses slower
[2:14:36] <TheImmortal70> Lamp does more damage
[2:14:36] <%Typhaeon> What does the synergy do
[2:14:38] <SwindlerOfProgress> It's OK.
[2:14:39] <tacostarvedbeast> then you want something else later
[2:14:39] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's alright for bosses, but lamp is a better for bosses
[2:14:40] <eldritchmoeblob> it's hard to beat the lamp
[2:14:42] <+ThePayphone> lamp is boss killer supreme
[2:14:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Lamp is nuts
[2:14:47] <SaltyAzteca> @AngriestPat Crestfaller slows them down
[2:14:48] <VritraReiRei> @TheImmortal70 you cant freeze bosses, only slow
[2:14:48] <+NiktenKing> Not if you can permaslow a boss
[2:14:53] <diver__down> you want to use the faller on room clear, bosses don't really freeze
[2:14:53] <Kaltmj> Is this the farthest hes gotten so far?
[2:14:54] <eldritchmoeblob> it summons robin williams and you just can't beat that
[2:14:54] <%Jpdodds> Lamp has stand power
[2:14:55] <yodajr99> i love lanp
[2:14:56] <Louie_Salmon> It's fine, but freeze weapons don't actually freeze bosses so eh
[2:15:11] <+Griffin1171> purple
[2:15:11] <SubjectX07x> You can only slow bosses but I believe the crestfaller's reload is too slow to perma slow.
[2:15:11] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat frozen enemies shatter if you roll into them
[2:15:17] <DXLelouch24> were those mind flayers?
[2:15:20] <kvnmck94> its good room clearer with that synergy
[2:15:20] <+Crippl3> is pat throwing forks? what are thos
[2:15:24] <+Order_of_Mystery> the room is in the shape of an ilithids head!
[2:15:25] <kvnmck94> reload early and often
[2:15:25] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Killithids, specifically @DXLelouch24
[2:15:32] <+nolifegamin> Ilithids WutFace
[2:15:32] <SubjectX07x> Hahaha wait does the bottle stick into them?
[2:15:33] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> There's also the mine flayer
[2:15:37] <pectusumbra> surprised they didn't go with mine flayers
[2:15:41] <pectusumbra> haaa, of course
[2:15:43] <$Mendin> The Mine Flayer is their boss
[2:15:45] <kvnmck94> it breaks an glass sticks in em
[2:16:00] <Louie_Salmon> Some of the synergies are so good that you just fire a gun and reload it for the effect
[2:16:03] <CNExoSoul> @Louie_Salmon yes they do, just most of them don't do enough freeze damage to freeze them (moonbeam works for instance)
[2:16:03] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I just love the dumb puns in this game so much
[2:16:05] <Cosairen> it glasses em
[2:16:08] <$Mendin> Those are the Killithid
[2:16:31] <%TokyoCosmos> you can do it
[2:16:33] <+donpatrondx> high octane NOOOOOOOOO
[2:16:37] <+Superstarsage> just keep breathing pat
[2:16:38] <Louie_Salmon> @cnexosoul Oh really? Good to know, I assumed bosses were just immune to status like in most games.
[2:16:38] <$Mendin> Pat is forever taunted by locked blue chests
[2:16:54] <DXLelouch24> huh there actually is an enter the gungeon app for searching stuff but needs to be updated for AGAD
[2:16:59] <%thetruewaifu> i dont remember blue chests being so common before the update
[2:17:01] <+RedQueensAce> whens the every time pat breathes during gungeon super cut
[2:17:04] <kvnmck94> doin good patty boi
[2:17:04] <%TokyoCosmos> p[erfect room
[2:17:20] <VritraReiRei> @TheImmortal70 they increawsed drop rates this patch
[2:17:20] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The new update rebalanced room drops so you get more of em overall
[2:17:25] <+D3rrtyD4n> yeah i think its good for normals
[2:17:29] <kvnmck94> great alrounder, especially with the synergy
[2:17:33] <Louie_Salmon> Gotta say, you are aiming really well on a controller
[2:17:39] <CNExoSoul> @Louie_Salmon only status they're immune to is charmed (boss' adds can be charmed though) but freeze s certainly the toughest to use
[2:17:39] <%TokyoCosmos> PERFECT PLACEMENT
[2:17:40] <deviljhojho94> Kill them all pat
[2:17:42] <kvnmck94> i hate when they roll nat 20 all attacks
[2:17:43] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> You always have the option of going back to the old way loot dropped if you preferred that
[2:17:47] <SubjectX07x> The rebalance is also optional, you can choose to go back to the OG.
[2:17:47] <+Crippl3> pat
[2:17:49] <%Typhaeon> Me neither
[2:17:50] <$Mendin> CorgiDerp
[2:17:52] <DXLelouch24> see Pat the trick to beating the game is to believe in your heart youll fail thus activating Crazy Talk and winning every time
[2:17:54] <Skitsoguy> !emotes
[2:17:54] <DXLelouch24> US IT
[2:17:55] <Sol_Install> Oh
[2:17:57] <SubjectX07x> Which is pretty dope.
[2:17:57] <Calek> blanks are temporary buffs though
[2:17:58] <%MrMcCrabby> blanks are a temporary buff
[2:18:00] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> 2 per floor, plus some items give you one more per
[2:18:01] <Sol_Install> so that was nat 20
[2:18:02] <Skitsoguy> dang
[2:18:02] <IminyourBase> had you used them at all you would know that
[2:18:06] <VritraReiRei> @thetruewaifu they increased drops rates this patch
[2:18:13] <DLN002> armor hits also count as blank activations
[2:18:13] <yodajr99> is that a dog companion
[2:18:14] <deviljhojho94> are blanks elixirs now Kappa
[2:18:21] <+cirdrag> now we know, andknowing is half the battle
[2:18:21] <kvnmck94> go buy the key.
[2:18:24] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Yeah, the dice guys can nat 20. They can also nat 1
[2:18:28] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> it's real sad
[2:18:28] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah, learning about how blanks work made this game much more fun
[2:18:35] <%thetruewaifu> i heard people saying it was a glitch @VritraReiRei
[2:18:38] <kvnmck94> on a nat 1 they die instantly, an ye its sad
[2:18:40] <+Alzero83> Have you gotten the Proton Back Gun?
[2:18:44] <SubjectX07x> Their nat 1 legit confused me for a bit before I thought about it.
[2:18:47] <+D3rrtyD4n> do boss room now!
[2:18:50] <Rincewind1998> @thetruewaifu it's not
[2:18:55] <+Crippl3> @thetruewaifu it's not, its literally in the patch notes and the options menu
[2:18:55] <%thetruewaifu> OH ok
[2:18:55] <+D3rrtyD4n> while you have shield
[2:18:56] <$magikestral> at least the boss isn't going up, could be The Wall
[2:18:57] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat you should finish the tutorial for real, it gives you 20 hegemony credits
[2:19:01] <%TokyoCosmos> JUNKAN
[2:19:03] <kvnmck94> the glitch was chests spawning every single room on switch. literally nonstop
[2:19:03] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It used to be a glitch on switch where they would drop LITERALLY every single room in the game. They're intended to drop more, but not every single room
[2:19:05] <%TokyoCosmos> WOW
[2:19:06] <CNExoSoul> you can get a key from the boss
[2:19:22] <VritraReiRei> @thetruewaifu Patch notes: Added a new loot profile which improves shop contents, increases room reward frequency, and tweaks item/chest drop rates to be more generous, particularly early in runs.
[2:19:35] <%thetruewaifu> oh ok
[2:19:42] <%thetruewaifu> thanks
[2:19:44] <kvnmck94> the more generous first floor is the best tchange.
[2:19:50] <Maverick2736> Do blanks only regenerate after you've spent them all, or do they still regenerate if you have some left? How long does it take for them to regen?
[2:19:52] <+Superstarsage> sick dodges
[2:19:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Those turrets can suck it
[2:19:54] <Louie_Salmon> Wow the bottle sticks in them, that's a little brutal
[2:20:00] <+Ele_On_A_Uni> even the more generous drop rates can't make me good at the game
[2:20:05] <archxeno> whys he running so fast?
[2:20:07] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat when are you gonna stream you and paige co-op of this
[2:20:09] <kvnmck94> you need that one but youd lose your lead skin
[2:20:10] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @Maverick2736 You start at 2 per floor, some items give you an extra one each, and you keep extras
[2:20:17] <kvnmck94> KEY CHEST GO
[2:20:19] <+Order_of_Mystery> good pupper!
[2:20:24] <%TokyoCosmos> this is quite the run so far
[2:20:27] <$Mendin> Good CorgiDerp
[2:20:28] <Cosairen> @Maverick2736 you get your max amount of blanks back every floor
[2:20:28] <lloyddboy> DO IT
[2:20:31] <diver__down> that's worth!
[2:20:32] <Maverick2736> Oooooh
[2:20:35] <AJusticeLemon> blanks regenerate per floor, they also get carried over if you have more than 2
[2:20:37] <Skitsoguy> tiddlyCREEP
[2:20:59] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's possible to stack items that give you extra blanks, and just get like seven to start with on a floor
[2:20:59] <DXLelouch24> can synergys get to the insane bullshit levels Isaac can get too?
[2:21:00] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> it's nuts
[2:21:01] <Maverick2736> I was being ultra-stingy with my blanks. Knowing that makes it more fun
[2:21:07] <QaizerArt> !uptime
[2:21:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 21m 9s.
[2:21:07] <Louie_Salmon> But if you leave a floor with 2, you start the next floor with just 2, so there's no reason not to spend them
[2:21:08] <+Crippl3> I don't like the bulletkin bleeding D:
[2:21:09] <$magikestral> i love the lore on these army bullets

[2:26:53] <DXLelouch24> 1000 needles gun
[2:26:53] <PrimeDork> Every part is a passive item but that one I think?
[2:26:53] <the_sprankton> @natebud he has beaten the game before
[2:26:54] <+Weeewer> its not ba
[2:26:55] <%TokyoCosmos> big ammo

[2:26:55] <%Typhaeon> 1000 needles, 100 for each enemy
[2:27:00] <%thetruewaifu> do what i do and use the gun randomizer lady to cheat and get to floor 5 fast
[2:27:03] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> cactus' bullet speed is its strength
[2:27:06] <scottysunday> YOU'RE GONNA CARRY THAT WEIGHT.

[2:28:28] <eldritchmoeblob> ^
[2:28:31] <kvnmck94> frustration is the mind killer in this game
[2:28:37] <+Crippl3> 200 bullets nice
[2:28:40] <kvnmck94> or reload an save ammo
[2:28:40] <%TokyoCosmos> luck prevails
[2:28:41] <ELuscious> SourPls
[2:28:50] <%TokyoCosmos> table flips
[2:28:52] <kvnmck94> thats why they added that synergy
[2:28:59] <Louie_Salmon> You're still doing good in spite of the mistakes, so that's good.
[2:29:09] <+allups> what floor is he on ive never seen these tables
[2:29:09] <YourFalloutCompanion> @SwindlerofProgress dig the name LUL
[2:29:09] <%TokyoCosmos> dont forget about your table slide
[2:29:27] <%TokyoCosmos> @allups 4
[2:29:29] <SilverInferno3> Greater than the sum of their parts or whatnot
[2:29:30] <%TokyoCosmos> the hollow
[2:29:31] <CNExoSoul> @allups floor 4, the hollow
[2:29:38] <SwindlerOfProgress> @YourFalloutCompanion Thanks, man. Bayo 2's the shit. SeemsGood
[2:29:38] <Maverick2736> panic-rolling is always my main source of failure in this game
[2:29:41] <+Crippl3> pieS
[2:29:45] <kvnmck94> oof, close. smart plays doe
[2:29:48] <$Mendin> I'm calling a Wall Mimic somewhere on this floor ruining his day
[2:29:49] <+D3rrtyD4n> relax, pat LUL
[2:29:55] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Good thing the ends of rolls stick to platforms huh
[2:29:57] <Rincewind1998> @Mendin Already happened
[2:29:59] <+pixelkenj> Edge forgiveness
[2:30:06] <$Mendin> No, THIS floor
[2:30:10] <Rincewind1998> ah
[2:30:13] <+allups> damn putting in work i always die 3rd and never got pass 2rd for switch
[2:30:16] <reonome> i still hate them
[2:30:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Once you collide with the floor on the roll, you can't fall off I think
[2:30:20] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> you just slide on the ledge
[2:30:20] <%TokyoCosmos> theyre predictable as shit
[2:30:23] <+D3rrtyD4n> they used to. they still do, but they also used to. WTRuck
[2:30:25] <oAznoUta> based on what it's obviously referencing, the cactus should be shooting a lot faster
[2:30:27] <Mr_Strut> How does pat feel about real spiders?
[2:30:29] <+Griffin1171> They're spongey, tho
[2:30:33] <cerberuscarmine> spider peach
[2:30:53] <Louie_Salmon> Fire and explosions just ruin the spiders, I love it
[2:30:55] <kvnmck94> he should prolly be usin his lead skin more. recharge is pretty short
[2:30:59] <Dani_el_Dani> @Griffin1171 define "spongey"
[2:31:00] <+Mrthefro> 4 blanks btw
[2:31:05] <%Typhaeon> Lead skin is kil
[2:31:05] <%TokyoCosmos> flip coffins my man
[2:31:08] <$Mendin> He dropped it for the gunpowder
[2:31:09] <%TokyoCosmos> theyre tables
[2:31:13] <VritraReiRei> @kvnmck94 he dropped if for the gunpowder
[2:31:23] <eldritchmoeblob> shoot that slime
[2:31:26] <eldritchmoeblob> shoot him in his cute face
[2:31:28] <kvnmck94> oh ye, i forgot
[2:31:53] <%TokyoCosmos> oh shit
[2:31:54] <Louie_Salmon> I doubt this run is going past floor 5, so the gunpowder pickup seems kinda pointless
[2:31:54] <+Retrash> ROLL THE BONES

[2:32:21] <AggsMK7> Roll for SAN loss
[2:32:23] <eldritchmoeblob> BAD ACC
[2:32:27] <DXLelouch24> OH NOOO
[2:32:28] <zazzera01> LUL
[2:32:28] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Lowered accuracy refilled every gun
[2:32:28] <$Desmond_Vakarian> increase reload time
[2:32:30] <+Order_of_Mystery> increases reload time
[2:32:31] <Kipss> oof thats a bad one
[2:32:33] <legendarysabertooth> Not good
[2:32:33] <+jezred14> LMAO
[2:32:34] <+Griffin1171> big loss for accuracy
[2:32:35] <Rincewind1998> You lost accuracy, but got full ammo on all guns
[2:32:37] <DXLelouch24> RUN OVER
[2:32:38] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh, reload time, whoops
[2:32:40] <zazzera01> shot spread up
[2:32:41] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat you got worse accuracy but full ammo
[2:32:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Unsteady is longer reload time
[2:32:50] <latgeek> big oof. how long does it last
[2:32:51] <kvnmck94> its actually increased reload
[2:32:57] <Rincewind1998> permenant
[2:32:57] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Yeah I'm a dumbass with that shrine
[2:33:03] <Louie_Salmon> Oh okay, longer reload times
[2:33:03] <VritraReiRei> @latgeek permanenet
[2:33:04] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Don't know nothing about those words
[2:33:04] <+NiktenKing> Unsteady is acc down, reloaded can either be full ammo or double ammo capacity on all guns
[2:33:04] <%TokyoCosmos> oh fuck the reload
[2:33:08] <kvnmck94> @AngriestPat its longer reload
[2:33:10] <%TokyoCosmos> which one is accuracy?
[2:33:12] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @latgeek Forever
[2:33:12] <lloyddboy> blank last room
[2:33:16] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah, those reload times are rough
[2:33:21] <deviljhojho94> Unsteady means that you need to kill them, pat
[2:33:24] <kvnmck94> hard times baby
[2:33:25] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I just know that sometimes the shrine just fuckin' explodes, taking away most of your heart containers but quadrupling your damage
[2:33:25] <eldritchmoeblob> i could have sworn it was acc too but i'm a dumb dumb
[2:33:28] <YourFalloutCompanion> BibleThump
[2:33:33] <Maverick2736> It fucked his reload, but what buff did he get for it?
[2:33:36] <+Order_of_Mystery> HONK missed a blank 2 rooms back!
[2:33:39] <%TokyoCosmos> he got filled ammo
[2:33:40] <%GarbageNirvana> There are some guns that actually benefit from increased reload
[2:33:40] <Louie_Salmon> An ammo refill
[2:33:47] <%TokyoCosmos> also a chance to increase ammo cap
[2:33:59] <%TokyoCosmos> but he just got the refill i think
[2:34:04] <Louie_Salmon> There are worse debuffs, but definitely way better buffs
[2:34:10] <kvnmck94> i always get the extra blanks and lose blanks simultaneuously for no effect
[2:34:19] <PinkaminaP> unsteady reduces reload speed, reloaded refills all ammo OR increases max ammo
[2:34:38] <$Jayschroo> how much of this have you played Pat?
[2:34:42] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The blood shrine is real cool in this update
[2:34:43] <+Retrash> munch cactus
[2:34:48] <MyNameIsRasus> i mean he's got more genie ammo at least
[2:34:50] <CNExoSoul> feed useless guns!
[2:34:52] <eldritchmoeblob> this actually makes the cactus fine yeah
[2:34:54] <+Order_of_Mystery> munch cactus and dueling pistol!
[2:34:56] <+LegendCobra> are those gunboxes not good?
[2:34:59] <CasualCthullu> munch cactus andd pistol
[2:35:02] <PinkaminaP> Theyre usually bad
[2:35:15] <+Retrash> TURTLE PogChamp
[2:35:16] <eldritchmoeblob> with the reload time the cactus is now fine tho
[2:35:16] <%TokyoCosmos> STINGER
[2:35:19] <PinkaminaP> cause it only spits out guns of the same grade as the highest you put in, which you wouldnt wanna do unless its out of ammo
[2:35:19] <+NiktenKing> SPACE TURTLE
[2:35:19] <Louie_Salmon> I think munching is just a bad idea, better to have lots of guns for synergies
[2:35:20] <+Crippl3> YEAH YEAH YEAH THE TURTLE
[2:35:21] <+OntarioJake> thats a big gun
[2:35:23] <%Fidel_Castbro> TURTLE

[2:35:36] <%DedlokPM> @LegendCobra If you mean the chest, he is waiting on them because he currently has only 1 key
[2:35:36] <+LegendCobra> what does the turtle do
[2:35:37] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's just a very large shotgun, bigger than your character
[2:35:38] <legendarysabertooth> Both are soo good
[2:35:38] <MyNameIsRasus> don't forget to blank pat
[2:35:39] <Mr_Strut> STEAL IT

[2:37:23] <diver__down> Origuni is great especially if you get synergies on it
[2:37:24] <On_Target> Pat when picking up every gun: Oh this gun is terrible

[2:37:28] <CNExoSoul> @Hunk_Of_Dunk they absolutely do, they just have an incredibly high freeze cap and only a handful of weapons can do it -with- items
[2:37:28] <kvnmck94> you need charm for stealth

[2:37:39] <%TokyoCosmos> you need certain shit to steal
[2:37:40] <+jezred14> A box

[2:37:51] <%thetruewaifu> if you had a box or grapple you can

[2:43:39] <%eveningmars> Lots of improvement pat!
[2:43:40] <CNExoSoul> @Hunk_Of_Dunk i was able to do it a few days ago (i know how this sounds, so i'm not surprised if you don't trust me) but I had a buuuuuunch of freezing items and I was using a laser with a freezing synergy. You can only proc it once, after the boss thaws out it becomes immune to freezing (even slowing down) but it last a lot longer than regular freezes, i was able to get most bosses under half health before they thawed out

[2:49:02] <PinkaminaP> Pilot is also good for the primer
[2:49:04] <eldritchmoeblob> YEEE BOI
[2:49:10] <%AurumReaps> han solo
[2:49:10] <Mr_Strut> FREE CHESTS
[2:49:16] <$magikestral> pilot sucks to fight as but very useful on powder runs
[2:49:17] <PinkaminaP> monster blood is really good
[2:49:17] <%TokyoCosmos> monster blooood
[2:49:19] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> PROFESSER GOOPINGTON
[2:49:19] <lloyddboy> BOOT
[2:49:22] <%Typhaeon> Plague of Pistols
[2:49:23] <Louie_Salmon> Everything about pilot is sick except his default gun
[2:49:23] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> monster blood sounds cool
[2:49:23] <Eresus> duct tape!
[2:49:24] <+Crippl3> GET DUCT TAPE
[2:49:25] <energywarning> i love that that's the futurama language
[2:49:26] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> DUCT TAPE
[2:49:30] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> or tangler
[2:49:30] <+NiktenKing> DUCT TAPE
[2:49:32] <PinkaminaP> rip duct tape
[2:49:33] <Louie_Salmon> DUCT TAPE
[2:49:33] <+pixelkenj> monster blood was a good episode
[2:49:34] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> tangler is equally good
[2:49:36] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> tangler is the shit though
[2:49:39] <+JavaManJoJo> Duct Tape is amazing
[2:49:40] <$magikestral> duct tape will be useful later
[2:49:42] <+ItsAGundamu> YOU CAN DO IT
[2:49:46] <PinkaminaP> does pat know about the first secret floor?
[2:49:47] <Louie_Salmon> Well, another time
[2:49:47] <%TokyoCosmos> this pistol is the worst in the game
[2:49:50] <+Crippl3> yeah, I guess duct tape is better with better guns
[2:49:57] <%TokyoCosmos> i hate no gun pilot runs
[2:49:58] <SwiftTheFox_> Pilot is my favorite
[2:50:01] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> pat doesnt have the good duct tape guns yet
[2:50:07] <umbracatalyst> What was the raffle about?
[2:50:13] <%thetruewaifu> duct tape two lasers together and get a dual laser
[2:50:15] <$Mendin> Does Pat know about the TV
[2:50:28] <PinkaminaP> Id assume not
[2:50:29] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> I'm raffling away my virinity
[2:50:31] <%Typhaeon> Pilot's a rough start
[2:50:34] <Aleate> N
[2:50:47] <Eresus> hahahah
[2:50:48] <%TokyoCosmos> LMAO
[2:50:52] <%thetruewaifu> reset
[2:50:53] <+Crippl3> Better than your starting pistol at least lol
[2:50:53] <Sadolerlaqzarret> Heh heh
[2:50:53] <alwayspronking> LUL
[2:50:54] <+resstarr> for free its not bad
[2:50:54] <AggsMK7> Munch
[2:50:57] <%Otanojenkins> LUL
[2:51:01] <$Mendin> My personal canon is that between the N and the R, that the spellbook enemies' magic is powered entirely by racism
[2:51:03] <%AurumReaps> and so patricks troll run continues
[2:51:03] <PinkaminaP> does pat even know about shortcuts at all?
[2:51:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Unfinished gun could be worse for being free
[2:51:08] <Louie_Salmon> It's probably better than your gun at least
[2:51:10] <Mr_Strut> Pilot teaches you to work through adversity. Then when you play another character, it's like removing the limiters.
[2:51:18] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> They also carry over
[2:51:19] <legendarysabertooth> I would recommend using the hairpin on blue or lower chests
[2:51:22] <%AurumReaps> so Pilot is the training weights
[2:51:26] <kvnmck94> yes
[2:51:30] <Louie_Salmon> I also didn't notice for a long time
[2:51:39] <%AurumReaps> Pat Lee has to train hard
[2:51:44] <%TokyoCosmos> yuck
[2:51:49] <PinkaminaP> Marine is training weights, Pilot is for people who dont get hit
[2:51:49] <kvnmck94> eeeendless trash
[2:51:49] <imontwitch> wait blanks refill?
[2:51:51] <%TokyoCosmos> squirt gun can be good i guess
[2:51:53] <omnipotentcreature> if your wearing armor and you get hit on a boss, you should be able to still get a extra health like in isaac
[2:51:53] <Djinnazz> molotov gun is good.
[2:52:00] <+Mythicalbrit> Pilot is actually the best for secret area runs cus of the lockpicks
[2:52:05] <Louie_Salmon> It's like your limiters have been unlocked, after you trained in the blank-less hyperbolic time chamber
[2:52:08] <Butchyxl> squirt gun is great for floor 3 where you can push all the enemies into pits ^-^
[2:52:12] <alwayspronking> "I should be able to do this more easily" [CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE]
[2:52:13] <kvnmck94> oh fyucj'
[2:52:13] <Eresus> lol
[2:52:14] <+Mythicalbrit> he also scales the best because he can accumulate the most stuff
[2:52:15] <%Fidel_Castbro> LuL
[2:52:15] <Nedlin> Use the blanks!? But what if Pat needs them later?
[2:52:15] <Mr_Strut> Mimic time!
[2:52:16] <%TokyoCosmos> LMAO
[2:52:16] <+Crippl3> NO

[2:52:25] <+Crippl3> HO W COULD THIS HAPPEN TO ME
[2:52:25] <energywarning> that extra coolness is paying off
[2:52:27] <%AurumReaps> Pat fucking dies
[2:52:33] <kvnmck94> hes handling it well tbh
[2:52:34] <%Otanojenkins> FEEL MY PAIN, THE PAIN OF WALL MIMICS
[2:52:36] <kvnmck94> well done
[2:52:37] <GoldeNOVA> Hey @AngriestPat how about a Deus Ex Classic LP? Kappa
[2:52:38] <PinkaminaP> you can almost crash the game with the fossilized gun on consoles
[2:52:42] <Butchyxl> He got out of that better than expected

[2:53:35] <%TokyoCosmos> oh shitttt
[2:53:35] <%Agami23> i like isaac before the update ruined alot of stuff
[2:53:36] <+NeutrinoInteraction> I like Isaac and Gungeon about equally for different reasons
[2:53:38] <GoldeNOVA> Isaac is better in all but artstyle
[2:53:41] <+ItsAGundamu> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:53:42] <breaker_jones> you mean you dont care for the disgusting flesh and shit everywhere?
[2:53:44] <%Remery_> Isaac = Woolie's childhood
[2:53:48] <+Griffin1171> It's the same way I felt about switching from rogue legacy to dead cells
[2:53:53] <faldin> the lockpick is so worthless
[2:53:54] <%TokyoCosmos> just dont fuck up ez
[2:53:54] <AtlasMcCoy> I like the aesthetic of GUN more but I like the feel of isaac more
[2:53:54] <PinkaminaP> dont lockpick green or higher unless you HAVE to
[2:53:56] <+gloppie> Isaac is more meta-knowledge driven while gungeon is more mechanics driven
[2:53:58] <+resstarr> I wouldn't use the pick on a green chest or better
[2:54:03] <Butchyxl> ^
[2:54:06] <rafikator> Oh its the pat
[2:54:06] <+Crippl3> aslkdfjnal;skdjf
[2:54:07] <PinkaminaP> OPEN THAT SHIT

[2:54:17] <Louie_Salmon> @gloppie I dunno, there are a lot of mechanics to know in gungeon too
[2:54:19] <DLN002> no active item though
[2:54:19] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> LUL
[2:54:19] <Butchyxl> Blank companion!

[2:54:28] <$BoSteed> He does his best try
[2:54:29] <kvnmck94> with the right active item thats godlike
[2:54:30] <%TokyoCosmos> GOTTA HAVE A NICE ACTIVE
[2:54:32] <+resstarr> not great until you get a good active item
[2:54:32] <Butchyxl> He tries ^-^
[2:54:33] <PinkaminaP> too bad pat needs a good active item for it to do anything
[2:54:37] <%thetruewaifu> baby boy baby
[2:54:38] <+silvery_cricket> DELICOUS
[2:54:42] <scottysunday> Nice.
[2:54:42] <EASrake> grappel hook
[2:54:43] <alwayspronking> He tires ^^
[2:54:44] <Djinnazz> Now you just need an item that recharges on it's own.
[2:54:46] <Louie_Salmon> That seems really good with certain active items
[2:54:47] <+Weeewer> FUCKING GOOD
[2:54:49] <%TokyoCosmos> does anyone know if jetpack works with him?
[2:54:49] <SchroedingersFerret> Da Baby
[2:54:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> The sheer look of disbelief
[2:54:51] <+The_Nightmare_Emperor> Has he found the sentient junk yet?
[2:54:53] <CrimsonCore90> Baby pat running on screem
[2:54:55] <+Griffin1171> grapple hook if possible

[2:55:59] <MrBotchamania> Woah...
[2:56:02] <Louie_Salmon> I hate how the Pilot's gun is just ONE shot short of breaking chests, it's so annoying when the lockpick doesn't work

[3:02:19] <$Piemono> He just needs one more run guys!

[3:02:20] <Aleate> Obviously LUL
[3:02:21] <%Ninestempest> LAST RUN WHO DIS
[3:02:21] <+NiktenKing> SECOND GIG
[3:02:21] <+ChodicusPrime> "No matter how long it takes"
[3:02:21] <SwindlerOfProgress> Yeah, that's valid.
[3:02:21] <Louie_Salmon> @maverick2736 The extra active slot makes the gunpowder quest easier, and the lockpick+ discount mean more items in general. Just gotta get over the hump of his default gun being so horrible.
[3:02:22] <+Toast_Master_General> exactly
[3:02:23] <deviljhojho94> Last run: 2nd gig
[3:02:24] <linklol321> Just stop using the pilot
[3:02:25] <+chippracoon> oh~ we see now
[3:02:26] <leinadtonu> of cooouuurse...
[3:02:26] <%AllYouCanYeet> "no matter how long this run is"
[3:02:29] <IFlaske> hmm
[3:02:34] <+templar010> This has to be the work of a friendly stand
[3:02:35] <rafikator> Some one explain what crazy talk is

[3:02:43] <kwangalang> 12 HR stream boyysss
[3:02:43] <Rellim80> One more...
[3:02:48] <DXLelouch24> and here we see the infamous "Just one more run" at work
[3:02:52] <circular7> a run only counts if he eats shit in a boss fight
[3:02:55] <+ItsAGundamu> Nah just get gud
[3:03:01] <leinadtonu> You said that in the video with Liam, long ago.
[3:03:13] <yuribo26> I already prefer gungeon to isaac
[3:03:14] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat they've said a big paid DLC is in the works for this
[3:03:14] <kvnmck94> it alrdy does in a lot of ppls book.
[3:03:14] <Spydurman> what kind of update?
[3:03:16] <%Remery_> Isaac did nothing wrong
[3:03:16] <circular7> just do it perfectly Kappa
[3:03:19] <eco419> mmm no just git gud
[3:03:21] <HeianKyodai> They need to remove the starting pistols and replace them with something more fun
[3:03:22] <GoldeNOVA> Isaac is still much more solid design-wise
[3:03:24] <SwindlerOfProgress> I much prefer Gungeon, personally.
[3:03:25] <%TheGreatBamBe> Can't wait for Bullet Heaven
[3:03:25] <GoldeNOVA> Maybe because it's simpler
[3:03:27] <Louie_Salmon> I think this is the update that did it
[3:03:32] <+Order_of_Mystery> and that update is called Advanced Gungeons and Draguns
[3:03:33] <kvnmck94> theres a shitty drawing of him dabbing on isaac somebody oughta tweet at pat
[3:03:37] <%DedlokPM> @rafikator Pat's Stand. Makes whatever Pat says correct by changing the past to make it correct. apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[3:03:38] <+Weeewer> Spelunky > Rogue Legacy > Gungeon > Isaac > Rest
[3:03:40] <%MaximumDaximum> Yeah, but Isaac is more relatable to Woolie
[3:03:46] <+Weeewer> Oh shit put wizard of legend somewhere in there
[3:03:47] <CptBritches> GOOD BOI
[3:03:57] <%Remery_> Snorting Elmo again?
[3:03:58] <+Crippl3> pieBaited
[3:04:00] <yuribo26> @MaximumDaximum sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo
[3:04:01] <Dr00_PhD> Yo
[3:04:14] <CptBritches> Pat truly is addicted to Elmo
[3:04:15] <VritraReiRei> No love for Slay the Spire?
[3:04:16] <Louie_Salmon> @weeewer Don't forget FTL somewhere in there
[3:04:17] <+ItsAGundamu> you cant get stupildy overpowered in Gungeon though, you can get one good item in Issac and just break the game
[3:04:18] <+Schir> the update should've been called advanced dungeons and ray guns
[3:04:20] <Dovakhin573> I cant wait for dead cells to be done
[3:04:27] <cafarun> elmo break
[3:04:34] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah, and Slay the Spire. Damn, there are so many good roguelites.
[3:04:35] <rafikator> @DedlokPM cuz i thought it was just some jojo stand that i have not seen yet it changes the past to make the present correct ? so pat is never really right ?
[3:04:35] <+Weeewer> @VritraReiRei been waiting for that on switch. Im sure it would easily be top 3
[3:04:40] <hntronium> @AngriestPat Are you going to do Dead Cells when it releases?
[3:04:40] <eco419> ❤
[3:04:45] <Kipss> they couldnt use that name because the final bosses name is already 'dragun'. the dragon gun puns already used
[3:04:46] <+Schir> whoops, meant advanced gungeons and ray guns
[3:04:54] <+Haruharuharuko> sbeefSkat aww
[3:04:54] <%Sheep_thrill> @AngriestPat have you tried nuclear throne?
[3:04:54] <nolzee> Iron maidens are the worst enemy
[3:04:59] <kvnmck94> ELMO HELPING
[3:05:01] <Kipss> c-chest anatomy?
[3:05:01] <%DedlokPM> @rafikator Correct
[3:05:02] <kvnmck94> chest anayomy good
[3:05:02] <p3nguin32> can roll over tables, Pat. makes moving through some rooms faster
[3:05:03] <Kipss> rooLewd
[3:05:06] <lloyddboy> get it
[3:05:07] <%MaximumDaximum> That sounds threatening
[3:05:08] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat destroyed chest have beteter stuff
[3:05:08] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat better rewards from killing chests
[3:05:09] <DLN002> better chest break rewards
[3:05:11] <Butchyxl> Chest anatomy will make broken chests drop better loot
[3:05:11] <yuribo26> @ItsAGundamu you absolutely can get overpowered in this, you just need more stuff and its harder, which for me is better
[3:05:12] <deviljhojho94> gun
[3:05:13] <kvnmck94> when you blow open chests their more likely to drop items
[3:05:15] <TheImmortal70> Better items from chest breaks
[3:05:15] <linkwolf4> broken chests are better
[3:05:18] <SwindlerOfProgress> Makes breaking chests more likely to actually give you something good.
[3:05:18] <zazzera01> turns junk into half hearts
[3:05:19] <Butchyxl> so you get better rewards if your lockpick fails
[3:05:20] <rafikator> @DedlokPM hey im right for once
[3:05:21] <%TokyoCosmos> better breaking rewards good with lockpick fails
[3:05:21] <Louie_Salmon> It's decent
[3:05:22] <DLN002> also has a synergy with lowercase r
[3:05:23] <SatansDick1> boobs
[3:05:31] <Jigokuro> The hypest drinking on Twitch
[3:05:32] <Graxe_> Elmo is gonna attack ghosts now.
[3:05:40] <kvnmck94> the best fuckin synergy with lowercase R
[3:05:40] <eco419> idk
[3:05:46] <leinadtonu> Be brave Pat!
[3:05:49] <thisisacoolguy> when you think about it opening chests in this game is like opening loot boxes
[3:05:56] <kvnmck94> turns it into the damn AKey-47
[3:06:01] <kvnmck94> GO GO GO
[3:06:02] <+Schir> hey pat, how does it feel to know that you've outlasted redlettermedia's gaming channel

[3:06:05] <Rincewind1998> Pat, you're corner strategy works well in stuff like RE4, but in Gungeon it tends to get you killed

[3:06:43] <+HyraFukit> Is that a beer or an energy drink?

[3:06:46] <+Radiantomega> someone clip that
[3:06:46] <%Remery_> Someone call Paige?
[3:06:47] <CptBritches> I blame you for being a bad player
[3:06:48] <Mr_Strut> Don't blame best character.
[3:06:50] <+Worldbrand> More like I blame the autopilot
[3:06:52] <Calek> why not just use the key though
[3:06:54] <deviljhojho94> UNLIMITED LAST RUN WORKS
[3:06:54] <%cerass> Patrick "last run" Boivin
[3:06:59] <lostvayne91> frustration is a slow boil
[3:06:59] <+Order_of_Mystery> hey everybody bugging him to be pilot: that was partially your fault
[3:07:00] <+Radiantomega> imortalize it
[3:07:00] <TranquilTurnip> Last Run: 3rd Strike
[3:07:02] <thisisacoolguy> You spend money to buy a key to the box and you don't know the contents till you open it. The chests = lootboxes confirmed?
[3:07:03] <kvnmck94> ive never felt so triggered and frankly attacked personally
[3:07:05] <Dral54> Last run 3: Third Strike
[3:07:05] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> I'm not kidding, that was DSP levels of stupid.
[3:07:07] <+SirRoyco> Is this a DSP stream now?
[3:07:08] <+ItsAGundamu> @yuribo26 I get you but In Issac you can get one item that can carry you the entire game while in gungeon it takes a lot to get to the point where you feel powerfull. Different stroke for different folks i guess
[3:07:11] <TheImmortal70> @AngriestPat LISTEN TO ME. HE IS CURSED. The fucking pilot with his lockpick is fucking cursed. They rigged the rooms and their contents to be harder because of how good he is, even if nobody believes me it's TRUE!
[3:07:13] <+Therealskie> Pilot strong, Pat weak
[3:07:17] <Butchyxl> The pilot has a way to not use keys though, pat will never use a key on this character >-<
[3:07:27] <yuribo26> @ItsAGundamu true
[3:07:27] <Jinrandomstuffhere> hello
[3:07:28] <CptBritches> The runs will never end, he will die sitting there saying, "One more, guys..."
[3:07:33] <DonatelloJose> That run didn't count, 2nd Gig
[3:07:37] <kvnmck94> his key has betrayed me so often

[3:08:31] <+Sheepwalk> the one that got away
[3:08:31] <SatansDick1> tilted
[3:08:33] <energywarning> just checking for secret rooms is all
[3:08:34] <%MaximumDaximum> I feel like Pat is going to have an aneurysm
[3:08:35] <Seditary> pat is being a special boi today, I believe in him
[3:08:36] <kvnmck94> it didnt even count rlly
[3:08:36] <+SailingSaturn> cirSlain
[3:08:37] <lostvayne91> the tilt has already set
[3:08:40] <Cosairen> pats going berserk! just like guts!
[3:08:43] <hntronium> Pat, stop talking
[3:08:46] <+Schir> This just in: Pat now using tilt controls
[3:08:49] <circular7> crazy talk is powering up
[3:08:51] <+WhyIDie> don't believe in yourself, believe in chat, who sure as hell doesn't believe in you
[3:08:53] <bunbundabuni> is jus soft touch crazy talk
[3:08:54] <+Flambage> Fill Pats Twitter with broken chests
[3:08:55] <Dovakhin573> Omg i cant stop laughing
[3:08:56] <+Retrash> pat is losing his mind LUL
[3:09:00] <Louie_Salmon> If you fall into the trap of resetting at the first mistake of every run, you will never leave the first floor
[3:09:04] <kvnmck94> oh god its happening
[3:09:04] <mandragoraroot> yeah
[3:09:05] <Mr_Strut> Grappling hook!
[3:09:05] <+Order_of_Mystery> grappling hook lets you steal, @AngriestPat !
[3:09:08] <+Sheepwalk> LUL
[3:09:12] <+ItsAGundamu> I dont think pat is stable enough for the podcast tommorow
[3:09:12] <scottysunday> you've got two blanks also
[3:09:14] <+Silversunburst> Oh yea you can feel his rage
[3:09:15] <$Bncbck> WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FOCUS PAT
[3:09:15] <Butchyxl> Though if you steal you get points of curse
[3:09:20] <kvnmck94> this is it bois, pat breaks live on stream
[3:09:25] <Devil_May_Sly> All the characters have pros and cons, none of the main four are better or worse, they each just take some getting used to
[3:09:28] <Maverick2736> @AngriestPat grappling hook lets you steal, btw
[3:09:31] <+Dr_Danger_ScD> use the grapple hook to steal the crestfaller
[3:09:36] <Dovakhin573> Hey does curse make bosses harder?
[3:09:41] <Louie_Salmon> Curse points are arguably good, and free items are definitely good
[3:09:43] <+Therealskie> Oh no buffed rubber bullets how scary
[3:09:48] <Mr_Strut> Only if the boss is jammed.
[3:09:57] <$Piemono> Curse makes some items stronger
[3:09:59] <jet_jakal> The inevitable heat death of pat's soul...
[3:10:01] <kvnmck94> curse increases the chance to cause jammed enemies and bosses
[3:10:02] <Louie_Salmon> @dovakhin573 With very high curse, there's like a 10% chance for a jammed boss yeah
[3:10:07] <nolzee> Oh my god, I just realised they are rubber bullets, of course
[3:10:10] <Butchyxl> Curse gives enemys a chance to have 3x as much hp, after 5 curse bosses start having a chance to have that same thing happen
[3:10:10] <Dovakhin573> Oh
[3:10:11] <%Jpdodds> Pilot is great
[3:10:18] <Butchyxl> at least i think its 5 curse
[3:10:21] <kvnmck94> your just gettin flustered.

[3:16:50] <+Sheepwalk> @AngriestPat if you use lament configurum right before a boss dies, it kills all the spawned enemies
[3:16:50] <%TokyoCosmos> @SirSmudgey past the annoying beginner woes

[3:52:46] <%Typhaeon> Venti Oreo
[3:52:47] <%cerass> best clip. tweeting.
[3:53:02] <Soul_Intern> True
[3:53:02] <@SSaryn> Part 5 has been super confirmed but what about Part 6? I'm pretty sure I didn't hear about that.
[3:53:11] <Jaller101514> !uptime
[3:53:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 53m 13s.
[3:53:13] <kylejefferies> @ssaryn David Productions put out things for Stone Ocean.
[3:53:13] <The_Batman1937> Pat, any plans to LP Walking dead's final season?
[3:53:15] <Dovakhin573> The twins are nothing compared to the stupid Bullet Pillars
[3:53:31] <Soul_Intern> VA is gonna be so fucking good now that they will not anímate any plotholes
[3:53:33] <lloyddboy> link part 6 stuff
[3:53:40] <%Agami23> i have lotsa trouble with gorgun
[3:53:44] <nolzee> And they just keep getting better
[3:53:52] <+eldritchbee> Where clip
[3:53:58] <On_Target> you didn't do the Michonne mini-series
[3:54:06] <kylejefferies> @ssaryn Unless Puuchi was in Part 5 and i completely forgot.
[3:54:06] <rytisone> Minecraft LP will return
[3:54:16] <+capnbeeb> aw heck I missed the shenanigans
[3:54:17] <Soul_Intern> It will
[3:54:20] <ValidVenasaur> When's Hollow Knight
[3:54:20] <prime_name> Ah ;~;
[3:54:32] <+king_of_beggars> Kirby: 2nd Gig
[3:54:34] <Soul_Intern> Do the Hollow Knight, Pat
[3:54:37] <TheImmortal70> I would love a Hollow Knight lp
[3:54:43] <On_Target> When's Quest For Glory 2
[3:54:47] <Soul_Intern> Played by Woolie
[3:54:51] <+Worldbrand> I'd need the receipts before I believed that
[3:54:51] <Ser_Randal> FUC KYOU
[3:54:52] <SulfurousAcid> whens claire b
[3:54:53] <%pilgrimsayswhat> HOLLOW KNIGHT WOULD BE DOPE
[3:54:53] <TheImmortal70> Why not?
[3:54:53] <Soul_Intern> *Exclusively*
[3:54:54] <Dovakhin573> Man imagine paige trying out enter the gungeon she would die
[3:54:56] <TropicalPsychosis> @AngriestPat I know it's easy to burn out on it cause people tend to play it so much so fast, but I'm super interested in your impressions of Harrow and Sacrifice
[3:55:01] <+Worldbrand> not that part 6 is unlikely, i just think they'll take their sweet time
[3:55:04] <TropicalPsychosis> can't wait for you to get back into warframe
[3:55:06] <+Grayhammatter> a shame, but that game is SUPER long
[3:55:06] <+WhyIDie> how about when they release the last free DLC for it sometime in august?
[3:55:06] <+Squdnate> I will shill this request until it happens. Now that Vampire the Masqurade Bloodlines is easy to get running with the GoG version. Any chances of an LP or stream of it?
[3:55:09] <Soul_Intern> Hollow Knight is super fucking good tho
[3:55:14] <ValidVenasaur> Play Siege so we can see how bad you are @angriestpat
[3:55:16] <+mugwugsampoo> @angriestpat Does Elmo have Ligma?
[3:55:20] <zaiwolfgang> @AngriestPat any plans to stream lisa the painful?
[3:55:22] <+Griffin1171> stream xcom2
[3:55:25] <TheImmortal70> I think it's kinda crazy because Hollow Knight is generally loved
[3:55:25] <%Agami23> hollow knight is better to just play. let yourself get into the world and stuff. its supposed to feel like a lonely game.
[3:55:26] <Eresus> I dont think hollow knight is good game for an LP
[3:55:37] <$Bncbck> makes sense
[3:55:38] <kylejefferies> But i swear I saw a thing of Dio asking Puuchi if he believed in gravity in the David Productions animations.
[3:55:42] <%AurumReaps> play siege for us all Pat then we can give you tips to get good
[3:55:43] <Soul_Intern> Awww
[3:55:45] <Ser_Randal> ITS GONNA BE A LP
[3:55:46] <+NWR_James> Are there plans to stream Gungeon?
[3:55:49] <Soul_Intern> FeelsBad

[3:56:11] <AlasterAngelo> surprised Pat isn't baneed from Siege like the rest of the world
[3:56:13] <%breakfastmagepowers> I mean why play Hollow Knight on stream when you can play Gungeon or GODHAND
[3:56:14] <The_Batman1937> What, he is just asking if you are gonna stream Gungeon
[3:56:14] <@SSaryn> @AngriestPat To ask since we're on topic of streaming other things, any possible Danganronpa strems? Still willing to give that $100.
[3:56:15] <$Bncbck> ALL THIS VENGEANCE INSIDE ME
[3:56:17] <crimsonharvest> Hey I heard Gungeon got updated anyone played it?

[3:59:48] <%ssjklyco> What about "Hey Pat, can you come in for work today"
[3:59:50] <TheImmortal70> @AngriestPat Doesn't that make it perfect for Gungeon then?

[4:00:17] <On_Target> Matt got the big black dong killed
[4:00:19] <%finaltrinity5> @AngriestPat I guess it can't be Woolie screaming "THA PHOOOOONE" from Indigo Prophecy
[4:00:20] <+mugwugsampoo> @angriestpat You should stream Gungeon
[4:00:20] <ImpairedLuoma> pat talk about zapping
[4:00:24] <pede2011> @AngriestPat how come no matter when I tune, you are never playing any game?
[4:00:29] <crimsonharvest> How can I watch this stream from the beginning?
[4:00:36] <+king_of_beggars> Is @Stay_Hydrated_Bot a weird RPing user or did someone die of dehydration whilst streaming?
[4:00:39] <@SSaryn> Charm farming is still better than Deco farming.
[4:00:40] <The_Batman1937> What about Woolie saying PORT as the sub noise
[4:00:47] <hallowedhaunter> Monster Hunter tasty jingle
[4:00:51] <$Bncbck> @king_of_beggars it's a real thing
[4:00:51] <+zeiss_schreiber> The zapping systems sucks. We all know that already. :P

[4:00:53] <+pixelkenj> Deku Midoriya?
[4:01:00] <@SSaryn> Deco farming literally gives you NO CHANCE TO GET A SINGLE THING.

[4:01:14] <%finaltrinity5> Kappa
[4:01:14] <%MaximumDaximum> @AngriestPat Yeah, I agree. Decoration farming would be easier if it could be a little more consistent.
[4:01:16] <+capnbeeb> oh big agree
[4:01:16] <On_Target> @king_of_beggars There was that one guy who tried to do a 24-hour stream and died of deep vein thrombosis or some shit
[4:01:16] <+wolfdude_120> Charm tables were stupid. but at least with random charms you have more unique builds
[4:01:19] <Soul_Intern> "Fighting a fucking monster"
[4:01:22] <randomp141> @king_of_beggars someone passed out on stream from dehydration if google is to be believed.
[4:01:22] <Soul_Intern> Kinky
[4:01:26] <+capnbeeb> fuck having to hope you get the right level temper
[4:01:28] <ImpairedLuoma> pat zapping, how awesome is it?
[4:01:29] <xeros720> yeah, tempered monsters should be unlocks, not this random shit
[4:01:30] <$Bncbck> @king_of_beggars the bot goes on every stream i know to tell them to drink water
[4:01:34] <@SSaryn> Hey. Have fun getting NO HANDICRAFT OR WEAKNESS EXPLOIT.
[4:01:34] <crimsonharvest> its just a big stack of RNG to be resolved and that sucks
[4:01:41] <xeros720> and then you could get tempered investigations in them
[4:01:43] <Cosairen> i still havent gotten a fucking handicraft charm in 4U
[4:01:47] <hallowedhaunter> Hit it until it dies world
[4:01:51] <Cosairen> over 1k hours
[4:01:55] <+capnbeeb> it's like five or six RNGs on top of each other and it killed my whole mon mash group :\
[4:02:24] <ImpairedLuoma> if a deviljoe zaps, does it mean it works as a zapper and therefore it has a zapping system?
[4:02:25] <+king_of_beggars> That's crazy, and now I want a Granma_Bot that reminds you to "take a sweater, baby."
[4:02:34] <@SSaryn> If we do get a harder version of Behemoth, I assume that's when we'll get something like G-Rank and hopefully a rework to Decos.
[4:02:45] <%finaltrinity5> @Stay_Hydrated_Bot oh shit it's here
[4:02:46] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Ever play Underrail? (not UnderTale)

[4:03:27] <+NWR_James> I feel like you could just make up MH monster names and no one would question you
[4:03:28] <@SSaryn> I'd really like to see Lagi back from the prototype of World but I don't think we're ever getting that, at least not in World.

[4:04:44] <randomp141> Elmo needs a cane to wack Pat in the legs
[4:04:45] <+StrangeWords> @AngriestPat Gore magala in mh4u allowed you to get a really nice set for high rank with sharpness and some other nice stuff by going high rank and low rank gore

[4:05:29] <Soul_Intern> Pat is everyone's hero
[4:05:34] <+NWR_James> Give him a hug for David Cage
[4:05:34] <+Vroom0> Is it normal for a MH game to get so much free support? I was under the impression that it was one of those Capcom games where they regularly charge for upgrades to the base game like Street Fighter (Arcade, Alpha, Turbo).
[4:05:36] <Djinnazz> PLR says otherwise.
[4:05:42] <+capnbeeb> he globbed on the SPF 1000
[4:05:44] <%AurumReaps> pat your balls are out on stream
[4:05:48] <%AurumReaps> you fight saddler outside

[4:06:06] <%MaximumDaximum> What if all they brought back was Plesioth?
[4:06:06] <%mister___doctor> Jaggi
[4:06:08] <xeros720> MH games tend to get a good amount, usually they have a big backlog of ready made monsters though, so they are essentially making them right now
[4:06:09] <Soul_Intern> You wished Kappa
[4:06:12] <%ssjklyco> Underwater combat returns
[4:06:13] <@SSaryn> Gore Magala or Akantor sounds like the next ones.

[4:06:55] <WackyXmand> What did you think of Molten Tigrex?
[4:06:59] <+Worldbrand> I have no idea!
[4:07:02] <%MaximumDaximum> @Mctaylor94 Is that true?
[4:07:03] <%finaltrinity5> @AngriestPat why not build Paige a PC for here? Become the power streaming duo you were meant to be?
