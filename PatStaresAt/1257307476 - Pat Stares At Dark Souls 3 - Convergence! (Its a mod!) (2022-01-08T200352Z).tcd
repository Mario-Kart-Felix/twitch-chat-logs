[0:20:26] <AoiRob> a poison dungeon
[0:20:27] <+Mrbaconator> bruh
[0:20:28] <%RandomMishaps> WOW!!
[0:20:31] <+Shishi1205> big bear
[0:20:39] <Sapphire_Breeze> I hope there is a poison swamp area
[0:20:42] <%hax_metatron> That's like 1/12th of the game
[0:20:44] <unfathomarble> a bear? you mean Poohdor the unquenchable?
[0:20:44] <Tracazoid> "We put Tartarus beside the tutorial, as a joke."
[0:20:45] <+Mrbaconator> sounds like the place to immediately go and cheese late game weapons from
[0:20:47] <BliVru> @patstaresat I fear that after a certain point Elden Ring just goes from here on theres just reskins

[0:20:53] <zhenthrim213> jesus
[0:20:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No way its that short
[0:20:57] <+Chimeraelite> My body is ready
[0:20:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> and then once you beat that the game really starts
[0:20:59] <AoiRob> bullshit
[0:21:00] <%DashXero> That sounds like bullshit to me.
[0:21:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> Better than Dying Light 2
[0:21:03] <%g0atmeal> If you know where to go and beeline it, you could probably do it pretty quickly
[0:21:03] <@TheYellowcouch> that's if you git gud
[0:21:07] <%hax_metatron> @Sapphire_Breeze How about a poison open world
[0:21:11] <$Invlux> That's probably beelinging, yeah
[0:21:11] <+Mrbaconator> that tastes like LIES GIORNO
[0:21:14] <AoiRob> my first ds3 playthrough took 60
[0:21:14] <%dekkitout> Does this include crafting/farming time for quest items
[0:21:15] <%epide> where do ya thing the sun bro armor will be
[0:21:16] <%Calek> sounds standard for the other souls games
[0:21:17] <+Mrbaconator> the tase OF A LIAR
[0:21:22] <%deadbeat34> what they're not telling us is that there will be 4 or 5 main quests
[0:21:22] <%g0atmeal> bloodborne was like that, you can do it in under 3hrs
[0:21:24] <%hax_metatron> AND you're good at the game
[0:21:24] <%JoshManVGH> Get Gud at Time Management
[0:21:24] <%mostly_simple> it's gonna be like Skyrim. the main quest is 1/30th of the game
[0:21:30] <Treasure_Vault> @CappuccinoGuil Clearly Dying Light 2 is the better game because it's longer, duh
[0:21:33] <%MidnightBurst12> all in one shot
[0:21:34] <%nick__sayre> Yeah 30-40 hours *if you know what you’re doing*
[0:21:35] <+Shishi1205> speedruns for ER are going to be wild

[0:21:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> @hax_metatron negative status effects start to rise in the main menu
[0:21:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES IT WAS
[0:22:00] <%emperordread> Gief is a solid silly
[0:22:01] <Treasure_Vault> The entire continent of hyrule is slightly off the mainland
[0:22:02] <%Movemeister> The orb will glow eternal
[0:22:04] <Tomschiii> seems pretty good playtime, not sure why that would be Short
[0:22:04] <+Chimeraelite> assuming the map is all we can play and there's not some fucking sky city
[0:22:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Treasure_Vault 500 hours for completion isn't long, it's kidnapping you and trapping you in a basement for 2 years LUL

[0:22:18] <captain_elsewhere> hello fellow cacodaemons

[0:22:39] <Tracazoid> So Bioshock Infinite
[0:22:43] <+Chimeraelite> I just hate the story. I like Abby
[0:22:43] <ape_hawk> i dont hate lou2 because of anything other than the crunch culture it boasted
[0:22:46] <SaltyAzteca> And the moose LUL
[0:22:50] <tigerfang86> the problem is that all the fake problems mixed in with the real ones in the noise
[0:22:52] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Emlo!
[0:22:54] <%cade_calrayn> and Druckman being the smuggest of assholes about it
[0:22:55] <intestinal_bleeding> Hot lady pick me up and throw me plsw
[0:22:59] <%Taisuru> Got em
[0:23:00] <%dekkitout> People liked Infinite?
[0:23:01] <$Invlux> the stuff about it being about palestine made me etalAwk
[0:23:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> oh man
[0:23:05] <SubjectX07x> @patstaresat I mean I'm at 34 hours or so in my convergence LP (thanks for pointing me to this mod btw, it's sick.) And I'm still not done.
[0:23:07] <%emperordread> It's a smart game for smart players, remember?
[0:23:07] <%baka_sugoi> LUL mid
[0:23:08] <%g0atmeal> at least infinite had fun parts
[0:23:08] <DoubleTabb> don't think the game sucked. Was definitely way too fucking long
[0:23:08] <lemonade21icecold> whens pat stares at tekken 3
[0:23:08] <%greasypete00> my internet went out are we talking about that one guys game
[0:23:09] <+Shishi1205> LUL
[0:23:10] <+sewermonk> is mid fed?
[0:23:12] <%dekkitout> Gasp- you used it the right way
[0:23:13] <%SpontaneousC> Troy Baker throwing a baby fit  and yelling that the game should be above criticism has really invalidated anything that man can ever say
[0:23:15] <%Insom62> BIoshock MIDfinite
[0:23:16] <SaltyAzteca> What could have been BibleThump
[0:23:19] <Treasure_Vault> Big mid if true
[0:23:19] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Invlux wait WHAT
[0:23:20] <%Ne1son> I had Fun with Infinite though, not the same with lou2
[0:23:20] <+Mrbaconator> it's pretty mediocre but it has a cool aestethic
[0:23:21] <Dova573> IM STILL SALTY YOU DONT GET TO FIGHT THE SONG BIRD
[0:23:22] <SpaceQueenLiv> I thought Infinite's gameplay was fine but story not so great
[0:23:22] <+Chimeraelite> It's basic distraction tactic. Give voice to the BS and ignore the legit complaintd
[0:23:23] <Tracazoid> People loved it though
[0:23:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dekkitout I did, but it's not and indication that it's GOOD.
[0:23:27] <vile_brand> and also sony censoring certain games
[0:23:28] <%BigCoffee> INfinite is a solid 6/10
[0:23:29] <Dova573> Like that game had one JOB
[0:23:30] <%RustyCoyoteA> Why do people love that game so much? I never got it
[0:23:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bioshock wasnt as bad as TLOU2 but yeah..still POGN'T
[0:23:32] <ape_hawk> maybe ken levine cant get a game made because he keeps trying to make the oppressed minorities be the final bosses in his pitches
[0:23:36] <Treasure_Vault> I'm sure there was something cool in that game.
[0:23:38] <Treasure_Vault> Somewhere.
[0:23:39] <T_Sasquatch> It's the only BioShock i played but i really liked it and i love Elizabeth
[0:23:39] <%guiltyboya> tlous2 is bad because I don't like my favorite daddy being killed for drama
[0:23:39] <%valriot> Its the most mid LUL
[0:23:41] <unfathomarble> bioshock infinite void of indifference
[0:23:42] <%Bloomingzonda> I remember Adam Sessler hyping the fuck out of infinite
[0:23:42] <%MidnightPacif1c> but attack ravens though
[0:23:43] <%sporeian94> Did I wake up to the beginning of the stream or end?
[0:23:44] <EynoStiles> I tired to talk to my friend about tlou2, and he was like its a good game. and i want to die.
[0:23:45] <BliVru> No you are mid! -Kevin Lavine
[0:23:45] <%JoshManVGH> The Lutece Twins are the ONLY good thing about that game
[0:23:46] <DoubleTabb> Bioshock Infinite truly sucked. Very up its own ass
[0:23:47] <draca23> Only reason why people like Bioshock is because it is short and super easy while appearing deep. It is so fucking shallow
[0:23:47] <Tracazoid> LUL
[0:23:48] <zashrin777> Druckman inserting himself into sex scenes so he can rub up on Laura Bailey isnt great either.
[0:23:50] <%Taisuru> @Dova573 Wait, you don't? I thought that was the thing
[0:23:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, you talking about the main story ending or the DLC ending?
[0:23:54] <Treasure_Vault> And the DLC makes it worse!
[0:23:54] <%mostly_simple> maybe low-high or high-mid, but not mid
[0:23:56] <%valriot> its not a bad game, its just liek "yeah that was alright"
[0:23:56] <$Invlux> @Sapphire_Breeze Yeah Neil Druckman made it cause he hates Hamas LUL
[0:23:57] <+Shishi1205> was the dlc good?
[0:23:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> INFINITE TIMELINES PAT woolieMIRIN
[0:23:57] <%JamesCorck> I liked it >_>;
[0:23:59] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> But Pat, they played guitar tho! Kappa
[0:23:59] <intestinal_bleeding> You play as a temporal plague
[0:24:00] <$personmanthingg> that new ken levine shit explains so much
[0:24:02] <SaltyAzteca> The lead up to that end was dry
[0:24:03] <%JamesCorck> But my taste is shit, so whatever lol
[0:24:06] <Dova573> @Taisuru YOU FUCKING DONT
[0:24:12] <%epide> how do you guys feel about the next bioshocks probably gonna go open world
[0:24:14] <Dova573> SONG BIRD BECOMES A PLASMID
[0:24:15] <+sundayafternoon1> Infinite is less than mid, it is incredibly stripped down
[0:24:18] <%baka_sugoi> Crowd CONTROL
[0:24:18] <vile_brand> i remember the original trailer for infinite
[0:24:18] <%sporeian94> Remember how you lose half your guns that you've upgraded halfway through the game
[0:24:20] <%Movemeister> The DLC ending is slightly better than the main story, but that’s not saying much
[0:24:21] <yyyyfdugyu> CHAOS CONTROL
[0:24:22] <draca23> "You need to die, booker, because that'll fix the timeline" Me, wondering how the fuck that works
[0:24:22] <%VivaLetina> remember the time every single trailer had content cut from the final game
[0:24:23] <%guiltyboya> I liked Infinite. But it's a boring game. I'm conflicted on it
[0:24:23] <%Ne1son> Had good aesthetic though
[0:24:24] <%greasypete00> i remember getting to the end and thinking i just didnt get it and then many many years later i replayed it and its actualy just bad
[0:24:24] <%dekkitout> Was fireball the strongest
[0:24:25] <TyphoonSwirl> remember the trailer when the giant metal bird thing chased you down and shit
[0:24:25] <SaltyAzteca> Crowd control with BEEEEES
[0:24:26] <%JamesCorck> But Nazi killing tho XD
[0:24:26] <%Zebroneath> ALL CROWD CONTROL
[0:24:27] <%JoshManVGH> And lightning greneades
[0:24:28] <%Logoth_> Remember that time that guy asked everyone not to draw porn
[0:24:28] <%Ziegsy> THE FUCKING TENTACLE ONE TRIGGERED MY HOLE-O-PHOBIA, BASTARDS
[0:24:31] <%Logoth_> and then everyone drew porn
[0:24:32] <%patriotrenegade> Burds
[0:24:34] <%JamesCorck> Hehe skyhook go brrr
[0:24:37] <Ezikeyal> Crowd control with bees was good
[0:24:38] <DianaTheAscian> I still o to finish the first bioshock
[0:24:40] <Treasure_Vault> Remember the trailer that was A LIE
[0:24:41] <zashrin777> But girl dance and happy tho. Kappa
[0:24:45] <OboTolken> Bioshock Infinite did give us that one piece of really racist art that I've seen people unironically use on Facebook
[0:24:45] <Tracazoid> I'm still surprised there was a boss battle against a ghost
[0:24:46] <%Agami23> only bioshock game i played was infinite and that game was shitty and cursed
[0:24:46] <DianaTheAscian> need*
[0:24:47] <Treasure_Vault> Full fake trailer time.
[0:24:47] <%baka_sugoi> SPANK BUTT
[0:24:53] <%Artoo__The_Me> I said the wrong mod name sorry @patstaresat !!
[0:24:54] <%valriot> tbf thats still better than Bioshocklj 1
[0:24:54] <captain_elsewhere> i replayed bioshock1+2 last year and they are so good, i dont want to replay infinite and spoil the nostalgia, aslo i have bad memories of infinite because my mom was diagnosed with cancer the day i started playing it
[0:24:56] <+Deekman> @patstaresat the DLC was pretty good
[0:24:58] <marvel877> Remember how you could have more than 2 guns in the other Bioshock games?
[0:25:00] <+cynistarrr> i still feel robbed for not getting to play the stuff they showed like when they announced the game like 3-4 years before it came out
[0:25:03] <%JoshManVGH> Remember when you could choose to be a rasicts fuck in that game?
[0:25:04] <Treasure_Vault> @Tracazoid One of the worst boss battles I've ever seen.
[0:25:05] <%BlackStarAura> psaPorgmo

[0:26:03] <@TheYellowcouch> Lmao who needs rent protection renters???? pff
[0:26:05] <OboTolken> What're you gonna do? Sue your landlord? You have no money, your rent just went up 30%
[0:26:07] <%cylish> to make it equal to "Maket Value"
[0:26:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> how am I supposed to slumlord with all this red tape
[0:26:12] <Treasure_Vault> We thought it would be cool if just some people owned all the houses.

[0:28:15] <%W1nterTitan> Not really? I look like im in a toga yoga party

[0:28:23] <%Agami23> i swear the gear was made with dying in mind before looking good because it looks like trash normal
[0:28:25] <MarylandJutsu> @TheYellowcouch is it the very mecha style armor?

[0:28:37] <Saltmeisterr> hullo
[0:28:38] <Treasure_Vault> If rent increases by 30%, that's landlord-eating time.
[0:28:46] <@TheYellowcouch> will do
[0:28:52] <%Artoo__The_Me> Everything looks good in yoga pants
[0:29:01] <%valriot> it depends, the drg/mnk and tank stuff is real nice
[0:29:06] <%doomunderthestairs> I just saw Stephanies comment about landlords being leeches not even knowing this was about FF14 haha  TRUTH DOE

[0:33:15] <%XelanArdel> for a second i thought it said gryomancer and thought we had a silent hill crossover
[0:33:17] <JayEarly> it’s didn’t get nearly as depraved as Blizzard and Bungie actually seems to be improving its work conditions

[0:35:06] <%dekkitout> Druid
[0:35:07] <%thedankestmeeme> necro looked cool
[0:35:07] <%JoshManVGH> Priest of Gwyn sounds cool
[0:35:09] <AoiRob> BLOOD MAN
[0:35:09] <JayEarly> my man can’t find clothes
[0:35:11] <tanarath> Do a poll?
[0:35:11] <$Invlux> Druid is a summoner? 👀
[0:35:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Druid is un-deranged
[0:35:13] <%StephanieSadGirl> Druid looks cool, that knife is sick
[0:35:13] <%mostly_simple> aeromancer?
[0:35:14] <Sapphire_Breeze> blood priest
[0:35:15] <BliVru> druid has summons
[0:35:17] <concerned_dm> deranged hermit = Fred Durst
[0:35:18] <%Agami23> or like a deathknight
[0:35:18] <%Ziegsy> Necro has a back scratcher
[0:35:19] <@TheYellowcouch> Pick the one with the least stuff you recognise
[0:35:20] <%AnthroMetal> druid!
[0:35:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> LUCKY TED
[0:35:23] <%bundle_of_herbs> necro sucks
[0:35:26] <+bluedude153> Aeromancer has the single most busted spell in the game
[0:35:26] <YF23> Aeromancer sounds funky
[0:35:27] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> I think Pat's right not to go deranged hermit. The point of fantasy games is to be someone you can't be in real life.
[0:35:28] <tomahawkbender> Aeroplane
[0:35:31] <%AnthroMetal> blood for the blood god
[0:35:31] <%Sotetsu> Any of the summoner classes
[0:35:32] <spawnzie> Aeromancies are sorceries that do physical dmg
[0:35:36] <%callum3434> Necro
[0:35:36] <%doomunderthestairs> or that blood one I'd say
[0:35:36] <%Sotetsu> Druid looks cool
[0:35:39] <JayEarly> whats a blood priest
[0:35:41] <%pokefan9956> druid looks dope

[0:35:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYYE DRUID IS COOL
[0:35:46] <RevenantJoy> Druid is pretty good
[0:35:49] <%spitelite> druid summons rats
[0:35:49] <%dekkitout> Plant some dumbass trees
[0:35:51] <%AnthroMetal> yeyeyeyeyye
[0:35:52] <%Agami23> alchemist sucks dont do it
[0:35:52] <%pectusumbra> assuming it's a reference deranged hermit would be squirrels right?
[0:35:54] <jumpyhugs> I wanna see a summoner
[0:35:55] <+bluedude153> Druid eventually gets to summon giant crabs it rules
[0:35:57] <spawnzie> alchemist is consumable based
[0:35:58] <concerned_dm> alchemist is consumable items based
[0:35:58] <$SGrim> Druids respect nature. Pat litters out of spite. A match made in heaven.
[0:36:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> wait, does necromancer have summons?
[0:36:02] <%bundle_of_herbs> alchemist is the most unique one
[0:36:02] <jacobknight13> necro for the skeleton!!!

[0:36:06] <+Bailey__Gaming> go this dude with the big spon
[0:36:06] <$Invlux> Potion and explosion? so item class?
[0:36:07] <RevenantJoy> Druid is basically a summoner with poison/nature magic
[0:36:07] <BliVru> Druid is good for seeing all spels
[0:36:07] <%Agami23> death knight would be good
[0:36:08] <+bluedude153> Last time I played necromancer their big spell didnt work
[0:36:08] <+Tom_Bruise> get this man a bigger circle to put on his stick
[0:36:08] <+Shishi1205> a lot of classes can summon

[0:45:15] <%ashenfrenzy> ashenfrenzy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[0:45:16] <%StephanieSadGirl> I bet gief is trying to hump grandpa
[0:45:25] <@Fuggins4U> when Pat comes back, everyone pretend he's speaking dutch, he'll be so confused
[0:45:28] <@Fuggins4U> (don't do that)
[0:45:36] <+Shishi1205> If you use magic drinking the fp regen pot is super usefull
[0:45:36] <%StephanieSadGirl> @Fuggins4U Too late
[0:45:43] <@Fuggins4U> i am a bad influence
[0:45:50] <chhdez> Elmo cast himself from the tallest toilet in all Canada
[0:45:53] <MarylandJutsu> Fuggs...I.....
[0:45:53] <+dom3800> I tried this mod earlier today, started as a magic user and got bodied super hard
[0:45:57] <lemonade21icecold> lmao wtf is this lmaooooo
[0:45:59] <armchairmaster_> ...it occurs to me i've never heard a dutch person speak
[0:46:13] <+Shishi1205> Also there are some spells miracles that need 55 int or faith
[0:46:18] <%Artoo__The_Me> Pat we can’t understand you, you’re speaking Dutch
[0:46:23] <%StephanieSadGirl> Urge to ask pat Mpreg questions in dutch rising
[0:46:23] <@Fuggins4U> yay, Pat defeated the ninjas
[0:46:23] <MarylandJutsu> What was he in danger of?
[0:46:24] <$chance_h> Did they add Elden Ring to this mod?
[0:46:25] <+Shishi1205> just so you know how bonkers this mod is
[0:46:27] <%Taisuru> Wha happen?
[0:46:32] <MegaDizzy> What language is Pat speaking?
[0:46:32] <+SpaceLobsters> the dutch aren't real, it's like santa claus or the queen of england
[0:46:36] <lemon_lover28> ? why aren't you speaking english?
[0:46:37] <boopersn00t> What language is this?
[0:46:40] <%greasypete00> advanced
[0:46:44] <@Fuggins4U> advanced settings
[0:46:44] <gh0stbytes> minecraft
[0:46:46] <%Taisuru> Advanced?
[0:46:53] <%Artoo__The_Me> Pat what are you even saying?
[0:46:54] <boopersn00t> IS he doing some French or something?
[0:46:55] <@Fuggins4U> weird
[0:46:56] <+Jabbathefuts> Gluten tag? We gates
[0:46:57] <%greasypete00> oh huh thats weird
[0:46:59] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat, stop speaking french
[0:47:00] <%Taisuru> Huh
[0:47:04] <+Shishi1205> y
[0:47:09] <theanora1> but is Elmo okay?
[0:47:13] <+Shishi1205> int and faith
[0:47:21] <%Taisuru> Why is pat speaking french?
[0:47:24] <+Shishi1205> like almost everything here
[0:47:28] <BackflipCharm> Rats don't have scales, silly
[0:47:30] <FrostedZaibatsu> Is gameplay speed still tied to framerate in these games?
[0:47:32] <AoiRob> the engine is locked to 60 i believe
[0:47:36] <+ChimpQuik> Need a mod to go above 60on DS3, and it breaks sprinting physics.
[0:47:36] <spawnzie> Druid spells are conjurations which is what the mod calls pyromancies @PatStaresAt
[0:47:37] <%Artoo__The_Me> I wish I could understand French
[0:47:37] <+bokutachi_san> Did we look at the armor already? Does it give stats?
[0:47:37] <KyberNasse> Pat stop talking the klee kloo language, speak American :)
[0:47:37] <%Agami23> because stuff is probably tied to the frame rate like DS2
[0:47:37] <+Shishi1205> Cryo also uses both
[0:47:42] <+Jabbathefuts> Give English a chance!
[0:47:45] <mr_saturday93> woolie and pat streaming at the same time again. argh who to watch?

[0:47:53] <Treasure_Vault> There are fps uncap mods, but they seem finicky. Especially for streaming.

[0:48:07] <AoiRob> @FrostedZaibatsu it's a japanese console game from 2016 ofc it is
[0:48:10] <boopersn00t> Is this no-English thing a bit?
[0:48:16] <%epide> PAT HOLDS DEH POWA
[0:48:19] <%X2Eliah> why do you think
[0:48:24] <%Taisuru> @mr_saturday93 Does woolie have rat content? Didn't think so
[0:48:28] <@Fuggins4U> I told them too while you were saving Elmo, sorry.
[0:48:31] <%StephanieSadGirl> It was Fuggins fault
[0:48:31] <+bigirontarkus> yes
[0:48:33] <Treasure_Vault> Language isn't real, honk honk honk

[0:49:28] <@TheYellowcouch> Just wait until Gundyr summons his OWN rat
[0:49:31] <@Fuggins4U> that man is glowing from his axe body spray
[0:49:32] <%X2Eliah> that dagger seems to have good poise damage
[0:49:33] <%StephanieSadGirl> They must give you rat approperiate challanges
[0:49:34] <concerned_dm> Numbers get BIG

[0:49:49] <Sunstalker> God, I want a greataxe in souls that can do artorias flips. Just once.
[0:49:51] <%StephanieSadGirl> amazing
[0:49:54] <YF23> not surprised the spell one shots the very first tutorial area enemies
[0:50:03] <+Shishi1205> Cryo uses ice and dark/fire spells to proc freeze status from sec 1 @PatStaresAt
[0:50:04] <YF23> first big guy you saw it didn't do much
[0:50:05] <CuttleCrow> can you unsummon the rat?
[0:50:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> pat went with a druid i see. good choice!
[0:50:15] <%Sotetsu> Rat!
[0:50:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> @Sunstalker *axe* nicely and maybe
[0:50:21] <+Shishi1205> the thing speedrunners use to kill some bosses
[0:50:25] <@Fuggins4U> the rat will teach you martial arts
[0:50:28] <foxname96> @patstaresat Rat stuck on ledges always and forever if no pathing possible. Try to re-summon with green crystal
[0:50:32] <captain_elsewhere> is it me or is the fire noises blowing out the sound ?
[0:50:32] <@Fuggins4U> and name you Renaissance
[0:50:34] <ape_hawk> its a titty shard
[0:50:37] <$Invlux> Now here's the biggest question: can you respawn the rat after it dies
[0:50:38] <Treasure_Vault> @Sunstalker That's one of the reasons Ledo's Great Hammer is the coolest.
[0:50:46] <%StephanieSadGirl> we dont shit on shards in this house
[0:50:51] <NewWillinium> Because of the lighting and banners i'm getting some hard NV Legion vibes

[0:53:04] <+SpaceLobsters> rip souls
[0:53:08] <AoiRob> overconfidence is a slow and yaddayaddayadda
[0:53:11] <%Agami23> like blood guard starts with a spell that causes all enemies around them to get constant bleeding.
[0:53:13] <$chance_h> Rat can’t hold aggro, needs to turn on defensive stance
[0:53:17] <+sundayafternoon1> So does convergence change flow of the story completely?
[0:53:17] <NewWillinium> Has the Irilyth Doggo always have those swords jutting out from it?
[0:53:19] <%SpontaneousC> rat stuck
[0:53:19] <Jolly_Adventurer> @DashXero Reworked magic system with a lot more unique spells along with custom bosses
[0:53:21] <foxname96> @patstaresat I am really ashamed for you. Since your channel supports rat on rat violence. I hoped people change. Smh
[0:53:22] <%linSP> does this mod basically give sorceries in other colors besides blue but essentially the same thing?

[1:15:20] <%Order_of_Mystery> Cheer530 always fun to see you replay DS3 modded! in keeping with the theme of your character this time around, what are some games with good summoner classes/playstyles in your opinion?
[1:15:24] <KyberNasse> PatShitsAt
[1:15:32] <ToneBacas> what sucks about improper hydration is you might be already dehydrated, even if you don't feel parched
[1:15:37] <oozebear> people poop anywhere from three times a day to three times a week. anything outside that range is too much
[1:15:40] <%garatrose1> garatrose1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months!

[1:21:15] <+SilverDevilfish> Fightning
[1:21:15] <chicken_danger> the dark souls of dark souls mods
[1:21:16] <+Shishi1205> get that ring @PatStaresAt
[1:21:22] <%justcallmebobplease> I wonder how long it'll take before modders shove all prior souls games into Elden Ring.
[1:21:27] <%shurtal> i have discovered the weird radness of fishing raids
[1:21:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> weird, im hearing teeth clacking.
[1:21:35] <Daniel_Is_I> This one doesn't sound AS good but not bad
[1:21:39] <AoiRob> i think it's just VAs and minor additions that are left
[1:21:42] <%legendscar01> kill him
[1:21:44] <Quack_of_Dawn> Really nice VO here
[1:21:48] <LVL1_Scumbag> yes pls
[1:21:53] <+Shishi1205> this mod has a lot
[1:21:53] <+TaurusOxford> @justcallmebobplease Give it a year
[1:21:54] <%D00msDayDan> a tale of four lodrans
[1:21:57] <Cecrios> The Ur-Souls
[1:21:58] <Gabbycat> that would be great
[1:21:58] <+Shishi1205> like from all games
[1:21:59] <Ethel9727> If Elden Ring is the same engine...probably not long. It feels like we're gearing up towards that
[1:21:59] <SivShele> a tale of two lordrans
[1:22:04] <Yamchadassist> specially since its ds3 engine
[1:22:06] <%patriotrenegade> i think itll take like a year
[1:22:08] <KyberNasse> Souls Ultimate
[1:22:10] <+CammerTime21> Bloodborne will be modded onto DS3 before we get a PC release at this point
[1:22:11] <%StephanieSadGirl> Just shove it all in there, spread elden ring wide and just get it all in
[1:22:14] <DickieWoodsmall_279> remember that NV mod that just let's you switch to FO3
[1:22:17] <%justcallmebobplease> Yeah
[1:22:22] <DickieWoodsmall_279> yeah that one
[1:22:26] <tanarath> They have the playtest as a basis to start working towards it.
[1:22:27] <topiodonk> its probably easier than the people trying to shove oblivion in skyrim for years
[1:22:28] <ape_hawk> A Tale of Two Anor Londos
[1:22:35] <%Order_of_Mystery> I can't wait untiI Inferno gets his hands on Elden Ring. truly a blurssed modder
[1:22:46] <%justcallmebobplease> I think the 'no it's literally right there no loading in' will... be NEXT year.
[1:22:47] <+TaurusOxford> That'd be amazing
[1:22:49] <dd44dostivei> i thought they would have put every elder scrolls in skyrim by now. but it's been ten years
[1:22:54] <%Valdorick> "We made a tunnel that teleports you to the other games seamlessly"
[1:22:54] <+Chex868> Chex868 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Gives us mega souls
[1:22:57] <%justcallmebobplease> Can't stop the modder freak-beasts.
[1:22:59] <Cecrios> Then you can fight THREE pursuers!
[1:22:59] <Ekaelis> Hah, that would work if Drangleic map wasn't a complete mess
[1:22:59] <DickieWoodsmall_279> you can see the non-euclidean geometry clipping over the horizon
[1:23:04] <%blastyoboots> pump-a-cum?!??  ...wow I misread that BADLY for a sec
[1:23:05] <+Shishi1205> ye
[1:23:06] <%Taisuru> World of Souls
[1:23:07] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah but there are some parts of the worlds that aren't connected, like Lost Bastille
[1:23:08] <Ethel9727> You jump down from the Undead Asylum and land at the start of DS2.
[1:23:14] <+Shishi1205> you need it for some parts
[1:23:16] <BackflipCharm> A nonsensical island
[1:23:17] <rosemon5001> nahh its got to be the water portal from the trailer @PatStaresAt
[1:23:17] <ape_hawk> a mod that makes the transition from earthen peak to iron keep not head-scratching
[1:23:19] <%Agami23> theres also fall control potions to negate more of it
[1:23:21] <romanticzomedy> THREE pursuers for the price of NONE
[1:23:22] <%meatman_noplan> Then you turn a little further and oh, what's that in the distance but King's Field .
[1:23:22] <%StephanieSadGirl> PAt forgot that Pastarat wasn't there to save him
[1:23:28] <%ElkRiverDog> ElkRiverDog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Pat, do you know the YouTube channel Daily Dose of Internet? If not, it would be really funny if you went to their latest video and started at the 2:00 mark. I promise it is both SFW and adorable.
[1:23:47] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt you can buy embers btw
[1:23:50] <spawnzie> go up the blightown elevator and end up in iron keep
[1:24:08] <Ethel9727> Bonfire warping also already adds a neat interface for "new" areas to still feel like part of the game pretty effectively. Just "Oh you arrived at firelink, you can warp to Majula or...firelink."
[1:24:09] <+Shishi1205> get that talisman @PatStaresAt it has a healing Weapon art
[1:24:11] <KyberNasse> Three Pursuers? More like 4 Dragonriders
[1:24:15] <DickieWoodsmall_279> no you just find the flying car from FFXV and time travel through loading screens into old games
[1:24:25] <%Chex868> imagine if elden ring has a solaire summon item
[1:24:29] <DickieWoodsmall_279> and the graphics on your character clash with DS1 models
[1:24:42] <%waltzqueen> friends!

[1:33:55] <captain_elsewhere> fear the old brew
[1:34:00] <otakon17> Behold, the hot bean water. It makes us men, it makes us beasts.
[1:34:02] <zashrin777> Paaaatuuuuh, help me make coffeeeee
[1:34:04] <%justcallmebobplease> Sometimes I wonder just what sorts of antics Paige would get up to if she didn't have Lupus or her myriad other 'oh I might die if X' issues - like if she had a perfectly A-OK body.
[1:34:07] <%StephanieSadGirl> How long do you think its gonna be before Pat proclaims his homoerotic love for Plague?  This slow burn romance is killing me.
[1:34:11] <%Movemeister> I miss the BRRRR
[1:34:13] <oozebear> i wonder what's in zangief's blue drank in this animation
[1:34:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Arweynn she's asking pat to make her coffee
[1:34:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I like the lighting change, feels more fire-y
[1:34:27] <%StephanieSadGirl> @justcallmebobplease She has lupus because otherwise she would be too powerful for the universe to contain
[1:34:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> @oozebear probably a curaçao with sprite
[1:34:48] <raknikmik> What’d I miss?
[1:34:55] <otakon17> perfectly functioning Paige
[1:34:58] <otakon17> oh wait no
[1:35:05] <KyberNasse> @cappuccinoguil Theres a clip where I think she touched the bottom of the jug when it was still hot
[1:35:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> @raknikmik Pat's a rat man
[1:35:10] <zashrin777> @StephanieSadGirl I don't know if the world could handle the 3 way sibling relationship.
[1:35:15] <KyberNasse> Or something like that
[1:35:15] <otakon17> I just got here, saw Pat checking out the new spell vendors
[1:35:29] <Dustin_Gunn> Pat is AFK more than he's here
[1:35:43] <Gabbycat> he's a busy guy that's okay
[1:35:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> @KyberNasse okay, that's less bad than what I imagined, I thought she had held it on the glass part by the side, like a cup.
[1:35:55] <raknikmik> @cappuccinoguil Nothing new then!
[1:35:57] <lliam01> Pat, Andre can reinforce your catalyst, you just didn't go to the catalyst tab.
[1:35:58] <DickieWoodsmall_279> chat like "what if paige didn't require assisted living?"

[1:52:55] <otakon17> I wonder if the WeMod cheats work with the modded version of the game?
[1:52:56] <BedHome> CAN YOU HAVE A HOUND AND RAT OUT AT ONCE
[1:52:58] <tigerfang86> DOG
[1:53:00] <otakon17> BOO!

[1:53:05] <+bigbyb0t> yeha but if one dies you just summon the other?
[1:53:06] <%justcallmebobplease> NO SWITCH BACK TO RAT
[1:53:07] <otakon17> only one summon at a time?
[1:53:08] <+ikantreeed> Are Dark souls Miracles the equivalent of NFTs?
[1:53:08] <@TheYellowcouch> SPEED
[1:53:08] <%justcallmebobplease> RAT IS BETTER
[1:53:10] <%dekkitout> He's so fast
[1:53:19] <stranger59> It's because dogs can't look up
[1:53:20] <otakon17> try using the targeting stone
[1:53:22] <%dekkitout> He zoomies
[1:53:23] <ape_hawk> is that a shiny Houndoom?
[1:53:26] <+Shishi1205> man druid life drain is good
[1:53:32] <otakon17> he is ACTIVE
[1:53:38] <LenoraKestrel> Bones for the doggo!
[1:53:39] <AoiRob> at least you a second summon for backup
[1:53:39] <otakon17> he has THE ZOOMIES of DEATH
[1:53:40] <+Eizack> This game is very green
[1:53:43] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Zoomies!
[1:53:52] <oozebear> the dog ran away :lul:
[1:53:52] <tolloponik> he's moving too fast for life to handle him
[1:54:00] <%Nonzi_> now you can zoom in on booba
[1:54:06] <NaberiustheNefarious> wtf rat grew up?
[1:54:07] <otakon17> okay I am LOVING the "peeking from under ledges" shooting stuff with the staff
[1:54:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> murder zoomies
[1:54:13] <otakon17> Dude try the life chant
[1:54:17] <AoiRob> yea that's spot on for a dog
[1:54:26] <+Shishi1205> strenght bois covenant
[1:54:33] <%Dakuu75> Fryer Pasta
[1:54:47] <ape_hawk> rip
[1:54:47] <+ikantreeed> ded
[1:54:49] <otakon17> oh no
[1:54:50] <+Shishi1205> this mod dont play
[1:54:52] <+bigbyb0t> can you not heal?
[1:54:52] <lazysaiyajin> threaded
[1:54:53] <Aydarkzero> and here comes the ambush
[1:54:54] <Razeino> So Pizza Hound?
[1:54:54] <Brainhook> Ganked.
[1:54:55] <Gabbycat> LUL
[1:54:59] <Treasure_Vault> Nice ambush
[1:55:00] <+ikantreeed> u thought
[1:55:01] <roguemephilesclone> Oh yeah, make sure to Check Weapon Arts for Everything.
[1:55:02] <AoiRob> covenant trade item
[1:55:03] <dan_g_v> well darn, no more no death run
[1:55:06] <stranger59> He died as he lived... getting stabbed
[1:55:08] <%Movemeister> Dunked on
[1:55:15] <lazysaiyajin> LUL
[1:55:19] <oozebear> whenever poochy isnt onscreen etc
[1:55:20] <Aydarkzero> caster speed LUL
[1:55:21] <+Jessie_Lockhart> You have failed doggo. He will now return as an enemy.
[1:55:24] <%RealThiele> gio no
[1:55:31] <%Maids4lyfe> he died multiple times before thisw
[1:55:44] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Just tuned in cuz I was napping: does this mod make everything super easy like Cinders, Cinders is fun but man it kills all challenge
[1:55:48] <stranger59> Those were practice deaths
[1:55:59] <+Shishi1205> @SaphronBlackbourne not easy
[1:56:04] <+Shishi1205> just gives you tools
[1:56:22] <lazysaiyajin> is there a rat ogre spell
[1:56:26] <BliVru> Full playthrough?
[1:56:27] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I might like this more then
[1:56:28] <+Shishi1205> being cryo one particular boss was resistant to my magic and it was super ahrd
[1:56:30] <%TheDullaMAN> How do you like it so far compared to Cinders?
[1:56:34] <oozebear> it does seem more hectic though, the druid has more to manage than the usual caster
[1:56:35] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Having your own personal summons is pretty cool
[1:56:37] <%coward_man> but when's the stream of the Halo mod for DS1?
[1:56:45] <lazysaiyajin> LUL
[1:56:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> but making a mod is cheaper and fast
[1:56:47] <Jontman42> yeah why don't they just do infinitely more work
[1:56:47] <$Invlux> LUL
[1:56:47] <otakon17> making their own projects takes time and money
[1:56:48] <Gabbycat> easier to start with modding
[1:56:50] <%Nonzi_> RAT
[1:56:50] <+ikantreeed> @PatStaresAt Do u think Scholar of the 1st sin is better than OG ds2?
[1:56:50] <scrumbotime> da rats are in da walls
[1:56:50] <otakon17> modding takes time
[1:56:51] <@TheYellowcouch> RAT BETRAY
[1:56:51] <SaltyAzteca> HE IN DA CEILING
[1:56:55] <mike2hands> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:56:56] <Brainhook> RIP doggie.
[1:56:57] <Quack_of_Dawn> Rat in da geometry
[1:56:58] <otakon17> ZANGIEFS ZOOMIES!
[1:56:59] <+mattiabh> it's good training I guess
[1:57:00] <oozebear> cieling rat is watching you poop
[1:57:02] <%Complete_Phased> Yeah cause there are some great ideas stuck to being just mods
[1:57:02] <%pokefan9956> I dream of a future where all fan modders make amazing games instead
[1:57:02] <tigerfang86> WHAT THE DOG DOIN
[1:57:08] <Treasure_Vault> Ehh, plenty of game makers start with mods. Look at Toby Fox.
[1:57:08] <%Agami23> i have a build that regens HP so much that its silly and its still challenging even for me
[1:57:10] <%dalmek> you want them to Forgotten City it?
[1:57:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> They live there now
[1:57:16] <$chance_h> What da Rat doin?
[1:57:18] <+Jessie_Lockhart> You monster
[1:57:24] <otakon17> okay so the Summons have to be tweaked
[1:57:24] <Jontman42> modding takes FAR less time and effort than an entirely original project
[1:57:25] <captain_elsewhere> mama miba
[1:57:44] <otakon17> damn I love that dot
[1:57:49] <Razeino> It's probably a lot easier to use a game as a skeleton then make a game from scratch. Especially if you don't have a team/Money.
[1:57:53] <otakon17> I wonder if they fiddled with the dragon
[1:57:53] <%spitelite> i think pasta might have died from collision
[1:57:58] <+CranialActivity> Its a lot easier to be creative when you don't have to spend all your time just getting it working right?
[1:58:10] <Quack_of_Dawn> Probably fell through the leve
[1:58:10] <tolloponik> I never understood the point of those useless soul items
[1:58:13] <@PeachSaliva> RIP Pasta, best among us
[1:58:16] <+ikantreeed> pokemon
[1:58:17] <@PeachSaliva> F
[1:58:19] <Brainhook> DOGFIGHT!
[1:58:23] <otakon17> Dog v Dog!
[1:58:31] <otakon17> GET'EM ZANGIEF!
[1:58:33] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt One tip, get a talisman with a healing weapon art when you can so you dont run out of estus
[1:58:34] <DickieWoodsmall_279> A-Among us?!
[1:58:37] <%BigCoffee> druid looks broken a shell
[1:58:46] <+Shishi1205> go upstairs first
[1:58:50] <+StaplerSama> this mod is cool as hell but damage gets crazy high really fast to the point where its kinda easy
[1:58:55] <oda_flobunaga> Is the Necromunda: Hired Gun crossed with DS3?
[1:58:58] <otakon17> the dragon hasn't shown up yet Pat
[1:58:58] <AoiRob> @tolloponik you dont lose items when you die so you can cash them in whenever
[1:59:04] <%greasypete00> DOG NO
[1:59:04] <otakon17> it only shows up once you go up the stairs
[1:59:05] <+Shishi1205> rip dog
[1:59:07] <$Invlux> Dog D:
[1:59:09] <+StaplerSama> can kill princes in a single combo with the right setup lol
[1:59:10] <Brainhook> DOGGO, NO!
[1:59:11] <otakon17> RUN AWAY!
[1:59:12] <Quack_of_Dawn> Gotta go upstairs to summon 'em
[1:59:13] <%Nonzi_> NOO
[1:59:16] <tanarath> rip doggo
[1:59:29] <otakon17> he'll be fiiiiiiiiiiine
[1:59:31] <+Tucker0603> RIP borker
[1:59:39] <otakon17> the dragon is ANGRY
[1:59:48] <tolloponik> @AoiRob I meant the soul items that give you 10 like the fading soul
[1:59:54] <TheProtomanBlues> Man seeing DS in 60fps feels so weird to me
[1:59:56] <DickieWoodsmall_279> MAGIC PIXEL
[1:59:57] <otakon17> well that was close
[2:00:00] <+Shishi1205> LUL
[2:00:01] <%PocketBearIllustrator> should I try and get into the souls games now or wait until Elden Ring?
[2:00:05] <+Shishi1205> summon corpse
[2:00:09] <AoiRob> @tolloponik a little trolling ig
[2:00:10] <+ikantreeed> u can summon dead animals let's GOOOOOOOOOO
[2:00:13] <otakon17> the dragon is SUPER angry
[2:00:24] <+Tucker0603> oof just summoned dead rat
[2:00:33] <+Shishi1205> chat check this trick soon
[2:00:39] <%G_Thunders> This looks awesome because fighting these enemies melee never felt fun. The broken poise system just really turned me off the combat in DS3
[2:00:45] <+ikantreeed> He doesn't have a limited amount of cast for his spel??
[2:00:46] <%spitelite> the fact that it dots through shields is crazy
[2:00:50] <+Shishi1205> (I'll let you know when its near)
[2:00:54] <+Shishi1205> @ikantreeed ds3
[2:00:57] <otakon17> the poise system seems to have been FIXED in this mod
[2:01:03] <otakon17> lol another knight
[2:01:12] <BliVru> YOU THOUGH KNAVE
[2:01:19] <otakon17> >they added a ramp to this area
[2:01:19] <Brainhook> It's so weird to see a Lothric knight climb a ladder.
[2:01:22] <+ikantreeed> @Shishi1205 I never touched ds3 so i don't know
[2:01:23] <otakon17> where is the mimic?
[2:01:28] <$chance_h> Make out with the mimic
[2:01:31] <%spitelite> unlock the door
[2:01:34] <%G_Thunders> Working poise?? I need to see it because that’s amazing
[2:01:39] <+Shishi1205> @ikantreeed FP bar now
[2:01:40] <otakon17> WAIT NO MIMCI!?
[2:01:44] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Love the DOT on that
[2:01:46] <captain_elsewhere> man i hate skyrim and GoT for fooling people into thinking wyverns are dragons ._.
[2:01:49] <otakon17> I smell a trick
[2:01:52] <DickieWoodsmall_279> me, remembering the first playthrough when pat died to that mimic
[2:01:53] <%dekkitout> Where Mimic-kun
[2:01:59] <+Shishi1205> things have been remixed
[2:02:00] <%Calek> @captain_elsewhere they're all dragons
[2:02:02] <AoiRob> this captures the demon souls magic build experience
[2:02:05] <+Shishi1205> old bosses have new moves too
[2:02:16] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I mean they’re dragon adjacent
[2:02:17] <BedHome> @captain_elsewhere wyverns ARE dragons, historically a lot of dragons are also just snakes, lizards, or other weird monsters
[2:02:17] <otakon17> @DickieWoodsmall_279 I was JUST watching the compilation video of that before this, it was great
[2:02:17] <%RealThiele> oops all manus
[2:02:21] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Same family
[2:02:25] <$chance_h> Reject wyverns, embrace Dune worms
[2:02:33] <otakon17> wyverns are a type of dragon
[2:02:34] <captain_elsewhere> see what i mean
[2:02:40] <+Shishi1205> thats what i ddi
[2:02:42] <tigerfang86> YEAAAAAAAAAH
[2:02:43] <+Shishi1205> Did
[2:02:44] <CuttleCrow> thats insane
[2:02:46] <+Tucker0603> holy shite
[2:02:47] <otakon17> usually called lesser dragons because of their lack of six limbs
[2:02:48] <Gabbycat> not bad
[2:02:50] <RevenantJoy> @captain_elsewhere Do dragons even have a canonical designation? They're fantasy creatures not real species. I say anything goes.
[2:02:53] <+Shishi1205> Shoot that fucker away
[2:02:56] <%spitelite> binoculars
[2:02:56] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:03:01] <%G_Thunders> He’d rather die than move to come get you
[2:03:01] <otakon17> try the binocs!
[2:03:03] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @otakon17 *wheeze* THE FIRST CHEST IN THE GAME?! *wheeze*
[2:03:05] <%ZephynM> I was just thinking about this game earlier today before I realized I got the rona.
[2:03:06] <%solracc25> do it
[2:03:10] <RLT917> @captain_elsewhere you can google the origin of wyverns in heraldry and it'll tell you theyre dragons
[2:03:12] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt you have the binoculars for this
[2:03:15] <+ikantreeed> why de dragon always gotta scream at the top of their lungs
[2:03:17] <Quack_of_Dawn> You could use the binoculars trick yeah?
[2:03:17] <%ZephynM> Seems to fit today's theme for me.
[2:03:18] <TheProtomanBlues> @revenantjoy Dogs are dragons
[2:03:20] <otakon17> @DickieWoodsmall_279 laughed my ass off
[2:03:20] <raknikmik> Binocs do help!
[2:03:22] <carrion_king_> Hey, what's with the lighting?
[2:03:25] <+Sw3g_J> would it be easier to hit where u fight the knight
[2:03:30] <BackflipCharm> Maybe change to your druid gear that lowers the cost of your spells
[2:03:34] <+Shishi1205> dead centre
[2:03:37] <captain_elsewhere> adumWat
[2:03:42] <RevenantJoy> @TheProtomanBlues Lmao would sure make for an interesting lap pet.
[2:03:45] <%RealThiele> stare at that Drussy
[2:03:47] <Cervantas> what class is pat?
[2:03:57] <DickieWoodsmall_279> "While you were having sex with girls, *I* was studying the difference between dragons and wyverns!"
[2:03:58] <otakon17> a Druid apparently
[2:03:59] <Brainhook> Druid.
[2:04:02] <%greasypete00> druid
[2:04:03] <otakon17> he's ANGRY!
[2:04:03] <+Shishi1205> Of course
[2:04:08] <oozebear> this spell is fucking disgusting lol
[2:04:09] <otakon17> look at that dot GO
[2:04:09] <stranger59> That's nuts
[2:04:11] <%guiltyboya> BROKEN
[2:04:13] <tanarath> Just spam, pat
[2:04:16] <%Agami23> so pat, imagine buffing your dagger to do that dot
[2:04:16] <Gabbycat> insane
[2:04:17] <+cyantriton> more dots more dots
[2:04:18] <otakon17> I love this spell
[2:04:18] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Wow
[2:04:19] <tolloponik> what is this pokemon toxic
[2:04:19] <raknikmik> DOES THE DOT STACK?
[2:04:20] <Cobaltor_252> so how's the mod so far?
[2:04:27] <chhdez> PatDotsAt
[2:04:31] <+Jessie_Lockhart> That sounds broken
[2:04:32] <jumpyhugs> Dot Stack! Dot Stack!
[2:04:32] <LenoraKestrel> Stackable DOTs is the best way to do DOTs
[2:04:33] <Jetsfantasy> The DoTs stack LUL
[2:04:34] <%greasypete00> holy shit
[2:04:35] <Cervantas> thats busted
[2:04:36] <+Shishi1205> On my cryo run I have an spell call Abyss that does Dot too
[2:04:40] <NaberiustheNefarious> the stock market is going up!
[2:04:41] <dan_g_v> big numbers
[2:04:42] <otakon17> I think the more damage the dragon takes the angrier it ges
[2:04:42] <tanarath> KEEP GOING
[2:04:43] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Melting it's HP
[2:04:45] <otakon17> YOU GONNA KILL IT
[2:04:46] <%Faustgesicht> That's stupid
[2:04:46] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Praise the DOT!
[2:04:46] <five_foo> The mind goblin beckons
[2:04:47] <$chance_h> What da Dots doin?
[2:04:47] <%CapnBeefs> That is fecking gross

[2:04:48] <+BobTheDuck99> MORE DOTS
[2:04:48] <%WhereIsWill> thats amazin
[2:04:48] <%Order_of_Mystery> big damage
[2:04:55] <+Eizack> Is the focus regen just part of the mod?
[2:04:56] <+ikantreeed> stacks like frogs
[2:04:56] <captain_elsewhere> pestilent defiler memories
[2:04:56] <%dekkitout> More like dot market
[2:05:00] <+crimsonomen0> The difference between dragons and wyverns is I don’t care.
[2:05:01] <%spitelite> i think the mod creator likes druids
[2:05:02] <otakon17> DIE DAMMIT
[2:05:03] <LVL1_Scumbag> What a coward
[2:05:03] <+Shishi1205> ye
[2:05:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> Come back here and die
[2:05:04] <Cervantas> MOAR DOTS
[2:05:06] <%WhereIsWill> dude said F this LUL
[2:05:06] <tanarath> big PJSalt
[2:05:06] <SubjectX07x> Jesus christ and I thought my blood magic build let me do stupid things.
[2:05:07] <otakon17> aw
[2:05:10] <otakon17> you couldn't kill it
[2:05:12] <%greasypete00> he did that in the original game too i think
[2:05:14] <otakon17> he always leaves
[2:05:15] <dan_g_v> instead of dying like a bitch
[2:05:16] <%baka_sugoi> COWERD
[2:05:16] <+AlucardX60> He always left
[2:05:17] <raknikmik> Won’t this trivialize nosses? Fun tho
[2:05:19] <stranger59> "You didn't win!"
[2:05:19] <%dekkitout> Went off to Elden Ring
[2:05:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> thats how it was b4
[2:05:21] <otakon17> you can't kill him outright apparently
[2:05:22] <DickieWoodsmall_279> instead of dying from poison
[2:05:22] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Be funny if he died as he flies off from the dot
[2:05:23] <CuttleCrow> yep
[2:05:23] <dirtyswampman> its the same dragon that shows up later
[2:05:24] <+Shishi1205> item
[2:05:27] <+kewlmyc> COWARD
[2:05:29] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt missed item
[2:05:30] <+Eizack> Awww missed an item.
[2:05:30] <Foopoof> How dare he not die
[2:05:32] <otakon17> by the statue
[2:05:33] <%VioletHeart> Missed an item.
[2:05:34] <%Daziggedey> Missed an item Pat
[2:05:34] <captain_elsewhere> snaussage
[2:05:36] <otakon17> missed an item
[2:05:37] <+twdlrr> item
[2:05:38] <Mister_McDerp> ITEM
[2:05:38] <%G_Thunders> No one bothered killing him
[2:05:40] <%spitelite> go back
[2:05:46] <pi_in_the_sci> what did you get for scaring him away?
[2:05:46] <$chance_h> So unless there’s high damage multiplication, poison dot damage is Going to be main boss damage
[2:05:47] <BedHome> let him miss them
[2:05:48] <Cervantas> missed an eye-tem
[2:05:48] <five_foo> Missed item by statue
[2:05:49] <DickieWoodsmall_279> missed an item
[2:05:49] <otakon17> right side, statues
[2:05:50] <BedHome> sand through his fingers
[2:05:51] <dan_g_v> Ai Them?
[2:05:53] <pi_in_the_sci> "Storm Debris"
[2:06:00] <%greasypete00> it was harder to see in the og because you had nothing that could do damage like that and it took like 20 minutes to poison it down
[2:06:06] <otakon17> I wonder what Storm Debris does
[2:06:08] <+Shishi1205> upgrade
[2:06:09] <DickieWoodsmall_279> you got the item
[2:06:09] <+ikantreeed> those robes looks so nice
[2:06:12] <+Shishi1205> for aeromancy
[2:06:12] <Brainhook> Either pat is being extra careless today, or this mod really likes hiding the goodies.
[2:06:14] <+ikantreeed> the way they flow
[2:06:15] <dan_g_v> so, every chest is a mimic now, right?
[2:06:22] <otakon17> wow more Covenenant itmes
[2:06:26] <+Eizack> Wonder if a faith build is viable now.
[2:06:32] <five_foo> Sky magic sounds cool
[2:06:32] <CuttleCrow> gottem
[2:06:33] <%Axellogic> GET GOT
[2:06:35] <Cervantas> KEKW
[2:06:36] <+Shishi1205> big ambush

[2:06:37] <%guiltyboya> OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK
[2:06:37] <otakon17> you have gotten MORE Covenanant items in like an hour than I have in an ENTIRE playthrough
[2:06:38] <%dekkitout> Assassin

[2:06:57] <%Agami23> @Eizack a faith build is super viable with all the miracle stuff added in
[2:07:01] <Cobaltor_252> EXPECTSTIONS SUBVERTED
[2:07:01] <otakon17> but hey the dragon is gone PERMANENTLY
[2:07:02] <%Axellogic> GET SHOT
[2:07:04] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Check those corners!
[2:07:10] <yyyyfdugyu> :tf:
[2:07:15] <raknikmik> @brainhook He might still be thinking OG item placements
[2:07:20] <+Eizack> Glad to hear. I always run faith in Darksouls for better or for worse. (Usually for worse)
[2:07:22] <otakon17> Pat have you thought of putting your catalyst in your right hand and getting out a shield?
[2:07:23] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Damn Apone was so cool
[2:07:25] <+ikantreeed> Is there any mods of that vein for DS1 and 2?
[2:07:36] <RevenantJoy> Druid is a good sustained dmg build so far
[2:07:37] <%Complete_Phased> How long does the DOT last?
[2:07:40] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt there are some nuke worthy cryomancys that cost 1k fp
[2:07:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> oh shit when did we start?!
[2:07:44] <%Axellogic> That dude slid in
[2:07:45] <Jetsfantasy> I love the dinky little sound it makes and how it's just a little bolt for such a good spell
[2:07:59] <Cervantas> DS2 only has Seeker of fire and it's not as big an overhaul as convergence
[2:08:01] <DickieWoodsmall_279> whatever happened with that DS1 mod that starts after the main game?
[2:08:01] <raknikmik> Can anyone recommend playing Code Vein?
[2:08:08] <otakon17> damn you geometry collison!
[2:08:11] <%Complete_Phased> is the dagger poison too?
[2:08:13] <Brainhook> Ah yes, the greatest enemy of spellcasters: low ceilings.
[2:08:13] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Is this a pure caster build?
[2:08:27] <Foopoof> 🐀
[2:08:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> !uptime
[2:08:27] <@Moobot> @TurtlesAndTentacles I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 8m.
[2:08:28] <%Axellogic> If only it had some gooey sound like you spit on the enemy to sell its power
[2:08:32] <otakon17> @raknikmik it's okay, I tried it on PCPass and it's a serviceable game. A little floaty, very anime flavored
[2:08:34] <%spitelite> remember that the druid set reduces fp cost for druid stuff
[2:08:39] <+ikantreeed> @raknikmik there's a demo on steam
[2:08:40] <%ZephynM> I'm a little disappointed Steam didn't save my completed game. I had all the Lotheric knight stuff too.
[2:08:42] <+Shishi1205> @Jessie_Lockhart druid is int faith
[2:08:51] <otakon17> oh no
[2:08:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I got no notifications\. Damn you twitch
[2:08:56] <otakon17> the enemy HORDE is back up top
[2:09:06] <otakon17> Go Rat go!
[2:09:06] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @shishi1205 gotcha, thanks
[2:09:09] <+ikantreeed> @DickieWoodsmall_279 sounds like a dope mod
[2:09:21] <otakon17> okay so the Summoning pathing and targeting is still a little iffy
[2:09:22] <JackaxeAM> He's just one little rat, he's doing his best.
[2:09:28] <otakon17> but this is still VERY impressive
[2:09:34] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Pat seems more like Gandalf tho
[2:09:35] <+Shishi1205> I think only sorceres and miracle dudes go only faith or only int
[2:09:36] <lliam01> Some of the summon ai is really good, and some of it is REALLY not
[2:09:37] <Foopoof> It’s the thought that counte
[2:09:40] <Quack_of_Dawn> I'm gonna abandon my randomized run and download this, aren't I?
[2:09:46] <raknikmik> @ikantreeed I do own it just takes time investment to download it start it and play it. Is the combat floaty?
[2:09:46] <+Shishi1205> Conjuration users need both
[2:09:46] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @ikantreeed it's just "what if the game starts after lord of dark ending" but I don't know if they finished it
[2:09:48] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Patdalf the Red
[2:09:50] <Brainhook> Rat MVP.
[2:09:59] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt btw your spells are conjurations
[2:10:00] <AoiRob> some later summons have better aggro
[2:10:04] <otakon17> the stairs seem to confuse the summons the most
[2:10:09] <+Shishi1205> not "spells"
[2:10:13] <otakon17> Rat has a good deal of HP
[2:10:19] <roguemephilesclone> Is Staff Weapon Art a group heal?
[2:10:26] <%G_Thunders> That’s actually a good change
[2:10:28] <otakon17> looks like the Knight either despawns or wanders
[2:10:31] <Brainhook> PASTA; NOOOO!!!

[2:12:23] <+Shishi1205> is it
[2:12:25] <Idon__> you already got the longest weapon. A gun
[2:12:26] <%Order_of_Mystery> like the whip sword
[2:12:27] <AoiRob> level up for the falchion it looks dope
[2:12:31] <otakon17> he doesn't have the stats to use the Threaded Falchion right yet
[2:12:36] <+Jessie_Lockhart> How about a Longsword…a Glamdring maybe
[2:12:39] <RevenantJoy> Threaded Falcion maybe if you get the stats for it @PatStaresAt ?
[2:12:47] <otakon17> man enemies seem MUCH more aggresive in this mod
[2:12:56] <raknikmik> @ikantreeed I set it to download atleast I’ll have something do while chilling with the stream. I did see some Vergil shit on youtube.
[2:12:59] <otakon17> yeah there's a Darkwraith down there last I remember
[2:13:02] <+ikantreeed> YOU're real low
[2:13:03] <Aydarkzero> combat roll

[2:13:09] <otakon17> I KNEW IT
[2:13:14] <Brainhook> Geez. Every corner has an ambush.
[2:13:23] <+Shishi1205> threre's a darkwraith yes
[2:13:40] <otakon17> yeah hopefully the placement of "some enemy around every corner" wears out it's welcome
[2:13:41] <%RealThiele> shanked
[2:13:42] <Brainhook> Nice knife. Unfortrtunately, Pat's was greener.
[2:13:53] <Idon__> all that loot :(

[2:15:10] <%Dakuu75> You can't play these mods on steam, or you get banned right?
[2:15:11] <+mattiabh> good move
[2:15:12] <+ikantreeed> Is there more pokemons to summon or only dog and rat?
[2:15:15] <+Shishi1205> @otakon17 once per sit

[2:15:20] <+tacoducktwitch> top notch backdown gentlemen
[2:15:23] <otakon17> oh really?
[2:15:25] <AoiRob> @otakon17 if they die you gotta bonfire before summoning them again
[2:15:31] <otakon17> no wonder they give you multiple summons
[2:15:33] <%Dakuu75> bummer
[2:15:33] <+Shishi1205> @ikantreeed a lot of summons
[2:15:36] <pabloelenano2> what if he is not a boss now?
[2:15:37] <otakon17> that makes sense
[2:15:39] <%Agami23> the mod sets your mode to offline so you cant get banned
[2:15:39] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Pasta is dead, long live dead mau five
[2:15:43] <otakon17> shame you can't heal them
[2:15:48] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt summons are disabled in pvp
[2:15:52] <Quack_of_Dawn> @Dakuu75 Offline on steam and offline in game to be double safe
[2:15:54] <tolloponik> or make a mod account
[2:15:54] <RevenantJoy> Yup mods always default to offline to avoid bans
[2:16:00] <+Shishi1205> (or thats what it says)
[2:16:05] <otakon17> time to get THE CLUB

[2:20:28] <tolloponik> nice crotch shot
[2:20:32] <otakon17> my urge to play again has been REKINDLED
[2:20:35] <lliam01> and use a password to matchmake and pvp with other people who use this mod
[2:20:37] <boostergoldz> cryomancy has some fun stuff but the damage kinda sucks

[2:22:51] <+ikantreeed> Now We need Pat to do a karaoke session
[2:22:53] <%G_Thunders> Does this mod use any of the cut Time of day change skyboxes?
[2:22:53] <otakon17> HEAL
[2:23:10] <otakon17> nice
[2:23:18] <stranger59> hahahahaa
[2:23:19] <carrion_king_> No we do't
[2:23:20] <otakon17> sorry I thought the fall might kill you
[2:23:31] <%cade_calrayn> lol you almost crazy talked yourself
[2:23:32] <ComfyFox> non-believers
[2:23:34] <AoiRob> lmao almost got fucked by karma instantly
[2:23:38] <%Ziegsy> he hurt the BOY
[2:23:43] <stranger59> I know that feeling well, when you become unsure after the jump
[2:23:45] <%vaporousTippler> Doubt is always the right choice here.
[2:23:47] <otakon17> I wonder if the Summons HP and damage scales with your stats?
[2:23:51] <+ikantreeed> Rat's can't swim and walk through doors
[2:23:58] <%linSP> rat stuck!
[2:24:01] <Mister_McDerp> jermaRat
[2:24:03] <%bundle_of_herbs> just like zangief...
[2:24:04] <+unhuggable1> pastarat
[2:24:07] <otakon17> Go Pasta go!
[2:24:09] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @cade_calrayn I think crazy talk is still on loan to woolie until reggie finishes DS1
[2:24:09] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat, I never believe you can do anything, that way every time you succeed is a pleasant surprise
[2:24:12] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Press Doubt to Doubt
[2:24:14] <%Ziegsy> can rat heal?
[2:24:21] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt I suggest destroying barrels etc for chest
[2:24:27] <otakon17> Rat cannot heal on own
[2:24:31] <%Chex868> I really like the rat summon we better get a pack of them in elden ring
[2:24:32] <+Shishi1205> I dont remember where they are but ther's a few
[2:24:37] <otakon17> I'm sure a Faith that has AoE healing could work on the summon though
[2:24:47] <+Shishi1205> In general
[2:24:58] <+Shishi1205> Like the mod likes to hide chests
[2:24:59] <otakon17> in the enclosure it looks like
[2:25:04] <AoiRob> in the next room i think
[2:25:09] <otakon17> you need a torch in this mod it's darker than I remember
[2:25:17] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt have you seen the tiktok with the guy who gets his junkyard dog action figure in the mail? also are there any plans on another disco elysium playthrough?
[2:25:21] <otakon17> I hear big stompys
[2:25:29] <%MelBrooksKA> Blind
[2:25:34] <roguemephilesclone> Pat still hasn't checked his staff Weapon Art, that could be an AoE heal!
[2:25:53] <+Shishi1205> LUL
[2:26:00] <projectcapsule> its wild that ur fp regens
[2:26:06] <CrimsonGargoyle> Pasta da Ratsta
[2:26:07] <otakon17> yeah life chant sounds EXACTLY like an AoE heal
[2:26:10] <digaogrunge> RAT BLOCKS THE WAY
[2:26:15] <otakon17> I love that your FP regens
[2:26:23] <marshalmorphino22> Pat & Rat
[2:26:24] <otakon17> Rat SCAMPERS into play!
[2:26:30] <%Qsmash_> so does the rat eat pasta or is the rat made of pasta?
[2:26:35] <otakon17> oh lord he coming
[2:26:36] <%PinkertonDanPie> Gg
[2:26:37] <ComfyFox> RatBlocksAt
[2:26:40] <+ikantreeed> I'm playing DS2 rn and i'm surprised at how many ppl are still playing the game
[2:26:45] <otakon17> double team backstab bonus!
[2:26:48] <romanticzomedy> ah so HE'S the rat that makes all the rules
[2:26:48] <projectcapsule> rat makes pasta
[2:26:55] <+Shishi1205> scaling
[2:26:59] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> yes, and no
[2:27:01] <CrimsonGargoyle> 100%
[2:27:03] <otakon17> the dot is moving faster
[2:27:07] <%Ziegsy> hes like those rats in that terry pratchett book. he liked the word pasta so it is his name
[2:27:08] <otakon17> scaling for the WIN
[2:27:08] <AoiRob> well yea spell scaling goes up
[2:27:11] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @ikantreeed return to drangleic starts like next week
[2:27:14] <%bundle_of_herbs> you are crazy but not about that
[2:27:19] <$Cthulos> @qsmash_ he becomes soft and limp when wet because he can’t swim
[2:27:29] <otakon17> enemies are DEFINITELY faster in this mod
[2:27:41] <+ikantreeed> @DickieWoodsmall_279 what is return to drangleic???
[2:27:42] <otakon17> that is a long mace on a stick
[2:27:47] <otakon17> and a GOOD weapon for range
[2:27:52] <+Shishi1205> randos will fuck you up in this mod
[2:27:58] <otakon17> there was a chest and a shard in here before
[2:28:11] <otakon17> how do you get up there
[2:28:12] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @ikantreeed something reddit started to get the games active for a couple weeks every year
[2:28:14] <+Shishi1205> The winged fucks from the road of sacrifices? bastards
[2:28:17] <%Ziegsy> rat needs to be able to eat deads
[2:28:20] <BliVru> @patstaresat Hows the mod so far?
[2:28:20] <oozebear> no thicc boi? unplayable
[2:28:22] <+Shishi1205> he is there
[2:28:23] <%spitelite> pat no
[2:28:24] <%doomunderthestairs> winged knight
[2:28:26] <otakon17> there's more items in that room you just left pat
[2:28:26] <+Shishi1205> I see him
[2:28:29] <%G_Thunders> I remember enemies always being this fast but it’s also been a while
[2:28:55] <stranger59> Have the rat light your way.
[2:29:06] <+BobTheDuck99> that sword rules
[2:29:09] <AoiRob> should grab the torch from the handmaid next trip to firelink just in case
[2:29:09] <otakon17> ah the Astora Straight Sword aka the weapon all casters used to use because RAW
[2:29:15] <Brainhook> You could say that it's the Dark of the Souls.
[2:29:19] <%Qsmash_> yeah its way darker
[2:29:20] <+ikantreeed> @DickieWoodsmall_279 dope. maybe it's because of elden ring but I just finished DS1 for the 1st time and started DS2 and there's a lot of ppl playing tbh
[2:29:20] <%bundle_of_herbs> you can ifuse the trch for different colors of fire
[2:29:21] <projectcapsule> a rat in time
[2:29:27] <Jontman42> game is definitely darker
[2:29:43] <+BobTheDuck99> its a good quality weapon too
[2:29:53] <Treasure_Vault> selkie
[2:29:54] <%Ziegsy> cell key, my fave ff8 character ziegsyGaga
[2:29:54] <+crimsonomen0> Sekiro is my favorite Souls game.
[2:29:56] <+Shishi1205> game is darker to ofuscate locking on @PatStaresAt
[2:30:02] <otakon17> still this is damn near like a brand new game
[2:30:09] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @ikantreeed I played the whole game last month on xbox and got 2 invasions and no summon signs .-.
[2:30:13] <+Shishi1205> Its too strong so they try to make enclosures harder
[2:30:21] <otakon17> it's still a straight sword
[2:30:30] <%waltzqueen> you know what would be fun? a vendor that sells key items from old games that don't do anything. Just ajunk shop for fun
[2:30:37] <DickieWoodsmall_279> one of the invasions was in belfry
[2:30:38] <+Shishi1205> go down the stairs now for neat ree
[2:30:47] <otakon17> they could give you stat buffs
[2:30:50] <otakon17> bonfire?
[2:30:55] <otakon17> that's new
[2:31:09] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt you need 6 fragments to get a rad sword
[2:31:14] <krionik77> read weapon descriptions, some have new secondary effects now.
[2:31:24] <%Order_of_Mystery> sekiro dragon?
[2:31:26] <%meatman_noplan> Is that some Sekiro shit?
[2:31:26] <otakon17> ooooh
[2:31:26] <tolloponik> sekiro?
[2:31:32] <otakon17> is this a nod to SEKIRO?
[2:31:36] <+ikantreeed> @DickieWoodsmall_279 I started SOTFS on PC and had to wait maybe 2 mins max to get summoned when I needed my humanity back
[2:31:42] <otakon17> HE THROW AXE
[2:31:43] <SubjectX07x> @PatStaresAt 6 fragments gets a rad sword that you pick up in the tower with the giant archer, you won't get it until literally end game, 2 fragments are in the two DLC's.
[2:31:50] <+Shishi1205> I'll tell you one secret the last fragment is in Gaels arena where the chick invades
[2:31:55] <AoiRob> i think it's the fountain dragon's sword
[2:31:58] <Mister_McDerp> good doggo
[2:32:03] <otakon17> try the life chant Pat, heal your pupper
[2:32:13] <ComfyFox> too much fire
[2:32:14] <BliVru> its the lighting
[2:32:15] <krionik77> Get all of those for a unique weapon, the trees give you hints to where the next piece is.
[2:32:16] <+rancherobill> is that a summon familiar spell?
[2:32:17] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @ikantreeed guess I'm just trapped over here on xbox island
[2:32:19] <oozebear> L2

[2:33:07] <%ElkRiverDog> Oh wow! I finally was able to log onto my computer and my mobile feed is nearly 50 behind.
[2:33:08] <roguemephilesclone> Oh right, the green knife does a poise thing.

[2:33:12] <tanarath> Is the rat healing too?
[2:33:14] <+Shishi1205> One that a boss soul gives
[2:33:15] <otakon17> still Life Chant sounds like a healing ability
[2:33:24] <%Faustgesicht> bork busted
[2:33:29] <roguemephilesclone> Life Chant sounds super heal-y, though.
[2:33:29] <otakon17> I can't really see any framerate drops
[2:33:32] <Mister_McDerp> doggo no!

[2:33:53] <oozebear> nothing significant
[2:33:57] <otakon17> well I can't, not really
[2:34:00] <otakon17> nothing too extreme
[2:34:03] <ohno778> Pat has no ups
[2:34:08] <oozebear> deaf souls

[2:34:13] <otakon17> we still have sound
[2:34:16] <tolloponik> I cant tell between 30 - 60
[2:34:19] <+Plus_On_Black> I see it
[2:34:22] <%spitelite> we can still hear it
[2:34:28] <otakon17> maybe change it back to 1080?
[2:34:29] <ToneBacas> bait
[2:34:29] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[2:34:30] <%Ziegsy> ahh thats what l2 does. no sound
[2:34:31] <roguemephilesclone> Reading as a fast reader plays, yes. Absolutely.
[2:34:33] <BliVru> now we can
[2:34:35] <oozebear> okay oof there it is
[2:34:38] <Hydrapissed> bait and or high af
[2:34:39] <%meatman_noplan> the human eye can't see about 24 FPS anyway
[2:34:41] <BliVru> HERETIC
[2:34:42] <%emperordread> I also can't tell the diffreence :(
[2:34:44] <AoiRob> i think it's dropping to 40
[2:34:45] <otakon17> I mean I see SOME drops
[2:34:45] <DianaTheAscian> I also can't
[2:34:45] <ComfyFox> i guess u dont need a bloodborne pc port then
[2:34:47] <ohno778> You are a liar and a criminal
[2:34:50] <%PocketBearIllustrator> LIES
[2:34:52] <+Plus_On_Black> lol
[2:34:54] <+Shishi1205> upgrade
[2:34:54] <otakon17> but not that extreme on stream
[2:34:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> it's harder to tell the difference on stream, Pat
[2:34:56] <Treasure_Vault> The human eye can't see
[2:35:03] <Cobaltor_252> the eye doesn't see above 24fps Pat
[2:35:07] <raknikmik> I feel like this entire area has been under 60
[2:35:09] <otakon17> Upgrade spell slots
[2:35:10] <$chance_h> We’re watching at a lower frame rate because rural poors
[2:35:11] <ToneBacas> i haven't experienced 144Hz yet but having only experienced 60Hz I'll say the latter is pretty good already
[2:35:11] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I can't tell when just watching unless it's a back-to-back contrast but I can always feel it
[2:35:12] <dabuhman96> if you said this was Bloodborne I wouldn't be able to tell
[2:35:12] <oozebear> hell yeah i am
[2:35:19] <TallYoda08> D:
[2:35:22] <%Faustgesicht> y-...yes?
[2:35:22] <+CastleArcade> I can't see frames
[2:35:27] <ohno778> gottem
[2:35:27] <+crimsonomen0> You damn kids with your frames. Lara Croft used to have triangles for boobs and we thought it looked amazing.
[2:35:32] <+Plus_On_Black> oooooh
[2:35:32] <%Cozy90> THATS HOT
[2:35:33] <otakon17> there was another item on an overhang
[2:35:34] <%Faustgesicht> I can't see
[2:35:35] <cureneckbeard> haha gottem
[2:35:40] <%Artoo__The_Me> I’m hard all the time
[2:35:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> LISTEN, I'm just short and skinny, how DARE you ,sir?
[2:35:50] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt fun fact there's one spell and one miracle that affect your "movement"
[2:35:50] <%pectusumbra> that said the stream straight does freeze up visually from time to time though it still runs
[2:35:51] <otakon17> man I hate that ambush
[2:35:53] <FrostedZaibatsu> Sometimes  i too doubt 60fps on stream, but in game i can tell no problem
[2:35:54] <%meatman_noplan> my eyes are hard
[2:35:54] <+Plus_On_Black> @crimsonomen0 he ain't lying
[2:36:04] <%Cozy90> @Artoo__The_Me nice Kappa
[2:36:17] <raknikmik> DS3 Has engine stutters anyway. Framepacing with ingame lock is also wack.
[2:36:23] <AoiRob> level for the falchionnnnn it looks so cooooool
[2:36:28] <otakon17> putting those souls on the line huh?
[2:36:35] <otakon17> I mean 17k is a couple of levels
[2:36:40] <Rionxgarland> Convergence!

[2:36:49] <otakon17> I wish I had waited to get Sekiro on PC
[2:36:51] <%dekkitout> I expect ER's blightcon to chug
[2:37:01] <+Shishi1205> @Rionxgarland big rad mod
[2:37:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> from software doesn't know 60fps exists, let alone something above
[2:37:05] <+ikantreeed> Ima try to not watch ANYTHING about elden ring before touching the game
[2:37:05] <Aydarkzero> unlocked frame rates in a from soft game LUL
[2:37:07] <%SUITsWonderland> When can I have pat as Toilet Kun V Tuber? Its all I really want from life.
[2:37:11] <%pectusumbra> you want to bet Durability is STILL tied to the framerate
[2:37:12] <+ikantreeed> and I won't touch it for a while lol
[2:37:13] <AoiRob> it's fromsoft pat they dont know what 61+fps is
[2:37:18] <otakon17> man those snipers have some LONG sight
[2:37:20] <+Shishi1205> lock on is nuts
[2:37:22] <Sir_JackalI> I wish the Xbox One X version ran better. Been stuck with it.
[2:37:43] <+Shishi1205> go downstairs first @PatStaresAt
[2:37:44] <raknikmik> If Pat gets esrly code for Elden Ring it’ll most likely be an ps5 code right?
[2:37:48] <otakon17> I like Sekiro but MAN is it hard
[2:37:51] <BliVru> Theres a bonfire down
[2:37:52] <+CastleArcade> You're bananas
[2:37:54] <+Shockrates20XX> You don't think it'll still have the issues with physics tied to framerate?
[2:37:56] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Well in one of the console versions it actually has unlocked framerates but it only gets to about 30 lol
[2:38:01] <otakon17> THAT HOMING
[2:38:05] <AoiRob> if only you had some ashen estus

[2:42:14] <+Shishi1205> you are not a melee dide
[2:42:14] <+Them00n> Hi Pat and chat! How does Convergence compare to the cinders mod?
[2:42:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Is Pat's shadow freaking out to anyone else?
[2:42:21] <otakon17> doesn't say ANYWHERE on the site it needs the DLC
[2:42:24] <lliam01> ds3 follows the trend of the dlc being the best part of the game by far
[2:42:26] <otakon17> shadow flicker
[2:42:31] <otakon17> Galvanic means it's electric
[2:42:43] <%pectusumbra> I BET you'll get some type of bloodborne style beast shaping spell to screw people up in melee
[2:42:48] <+Shishi1205> BK btw
[2:42:49] <otakon17> Dark Knight be TANKY
[2:42:52] <otakon17> and hit HARD
[2:42:58] <SaltyAzteca> that guy did not care LUL
[2:43:05] <tolloponik> why is he there?!
[2:43:08] <vizardrob> Sauron last of the OG
[2:43:16] <otakon17> ah wait no
[2:43:16] <BliVru> @patstaresat infuse it
[2:43:17] <boostergoldz> there's a few kris blade equivalents for the various damage types
[2:43:17] <otakon17> I found it
[2:43:22] <otakon17> IN SMALL FONT
[2:43:27] <+Shishi1205> @otakon17 Thankfully, it's not too hard to download The Convergence. Players will need both pieces of DLC for the game (Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City) or the mod will not work properly.
[2:43:33] <otakon17> instead of being front and center in the largest font possible
[2:43:39] <AoiRob> should infuse it for druid build scaling
[2:43:40] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Oh lawd he comin
[2:43:41] <otakon17> yeah I don't have the DLC
[2:43:50] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Wow, the lighting here is crazy.
[2:43:56] <+CastleArcade> Maybe the falchion more disappointed with you
[2:43:56] <otakon17> I never found a good deal on them to warrant the purchase after losing my 120 hour save
[2:44:05] <kingra> nice damage
[2:44:11] <otakon17> plus atm I'm broke
[2:44:16] <+TopTieramisu> holy range
[2:44:16] <otakon17> I can't get the DLC right now
[2:44:24] <+Shishi1205> elements are good here bc weapons are usually 1 dmg type
[2:44:26] <DickieWoodsmall_279> best part of dark souls is starting the game over
[2:44:26] <Daniel_Is_I> Fuck yeah it's Cinders all over again
[2:44:28] <otakon17> that's a LOTTA range
[2:44:31] <romanticzomedy> someone get that man a das3 dlc
[2:44:31] <@TheYellowcouch> well that made shit real easy
[2:44:32] <+Jessie_Lockhart> What is this range?!
[2:44:33] <+TopTieramisu> sniper mage build
[2:44:34] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> That's busted as fuck
[2:44:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> what the fuck kinda range is that????
[2:44:39] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt Ranged enemies have that lock on too
[2:44:39] <+CastleArcade> That's insane range
[2:44:39] <SaltyAzteca> BUSTED
[2:44:39] <concerned_dm> yeah lock on range is kinda busted in this mod
[2:44:40] <krionik77> I mean, you aren't using a melee focused build, and you're up against enemies resistant to slash damage.
[2:44:42] <%dekkitout> Rare for mods for games that have definitive editions to be a la carte/not dlc dependent
[2:44:42] <ComfyFox> omg LUL
[2:44:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I would have laughed so hard if you died there
[2:44:50] <+CastleArcade> Cheap out the world, Patrick
[2:44:52] <+TopTieramisu> ez mod
[2:44:52] <%Faustgesicht> this feels.... easy

[2:55:09] <armandolorian> You’ll never wake up
[2:55:13] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt there's Advanced covenant item trading spots out in the world
[2:55:13] <BliVru> Check the armors? they hage cool things
[2:55:15] <wantedsafe471> wonder if pat will find all the divine fragments
[2:55:16] <%dekkitout> Bird up
[2:55:17] <LunarRemix> God there's so much new stuff I'm completely lost
[2:55:20] <otakon17> you can if you want
[2:55:23] <+Shishi1205> Its like the lion one
[2:55:32] <Gabbycat> cute
[2:55:42] <boostergoldz> it's just lionhart
[2:55:42] <%TINMANxHMx> pretty doep
[2:55:44] <+Mrbaconator> speeen
[2:55:47] <roguemephilesclone> Oolacile stuff I've seen is all weird and cool.
[2:55:49] <oozebear> that's pretty cool
[2:55:50] <otakon17> a combo bash?
[2:55:52] <+tempestzephyr> SPEEEEEN
[2:55:53] <krionik77> you purchase covenant items from them.
[2:55:53] <%Caped_Eggy> It's lionheart
[2:55:56] <Daniel_Is_I> That's Lionheart alright
[2:55:57] <%Bread_Assassin> IS it just the Valorheart moveset?
[2:56:05] <+bluedude153> its really weird but every unique upgrade mat is covenant tied. You have to switch out constantly if you are trying multiple weapon types
[2:56:06] <%TINMANxHMx> goblin slayer special
[2:56:16] <+tempestzephyr> that eagle just lion roar?
[2:56:16] <roguemephilesclone> Heart of Oogle
[2:56:19] <+Shishi1205> repurposed lionhearth
[2:56:23] <projectcapsule> the stick
[2:56:27] <+Shishi1205> Correct
[2:56:36] <wantedsafe471> light spells can be kinda broken. there's a spell that easily stun lock most enemies and bosses
[2:56:38] <otakon17> @bluedude153 he's gotten mulitple different covenant items dorps though
[2:56:41] <+Shishi1205> Drops
[2:56:42] <ChortlesJ1> Whenever I see those spin strikes, I'm always reminded of Plague of Gripes playthough where he blasts that kind of flashy fighting style
[2:56:51] <roguemephilesclone> yes
[2:56:56] <lliam01> upgrade starting knife is actually a really solid strat for any pure mage starting class in this mod
[2:56:58] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt Give andre the estus shard
[2:57:01] <+bluedude153> yeah just gotta wait for drops then

[2:57:26] <AoiRob> you can grab all the covenants here for free
[2:57:33] <+Shishi1205> My dagger used dark sediments to upgrade

[2:57:41] <+Shishi1205> dex?
[2:57:45] <+Shishi1205> Faster casting speed
[2:57:52] <%bundle_of_herbs> what about your new stick
[2:57:55] <+bluedude153> Ah, forgot the second part where there is "Early" versions of the covenant and "late" versions of the covenant and they each give different drops
[2:57:57] <%Valdorick> Dex god, Dex god, Dex god
[2:58:03] <krionik77> yeah, you can form covenant with almost every necessary in here, there covenants are sold in the shops they have, usually one of the last items in the list. they each have their own stuff.
[2:58:06] <AoiRob> you're bound to find a cool weapon sooner or later anyway
[2:58:22] <+Thyzoon> Hey Pat not sure if you've kept up with it but have you seen the new stuff Archthrones teased? Map stuff specifically?
[2:58:38] <Daniel_Is_I> The wiki seems... less than helpful
[2:58:41] <AoiRob> i think you gotta go to tree arena
[2:58:44] <%linSP> remember, dex rhymes with sex, which is why no one likes it
[2:58:49] <+bluedude153> I will say last I checked that wiki was noooooooot up to date
[2:59:05] <+bluedude153> Yeah you need to go fight tree boy to unlock essernce gems

[3:02:41] <raknikmik> Dagger kinda kicks ass
[3:02:52] <%AgniBrandt> @l3sovikk And you'd probably need to join a discord or find a password specifically used by other people who're using the mod

[3:10:51] <%Valdorick> He was never there, he only showed up there because Crazy Talked moved him just to spite you.
[3:10:56] <+MarkUriah> yeah he could get bodied super easily if he we inside
[3:11:00] <otakon17> doggo has too much HP
[3:11:06] <boostergoldz> did you free greirat
[3:11:08] <roguemephilesclone> Text-to-speech DS3 has ruined me.
[3:11:22] <otakon17> go PASTA!
[3:11:24] <armandolorian> Damn fart darts rule
[3:11:24] <otakon17> I choose YOU!
[3:11:25] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt If you notice these enemies have the axe from the cut content they use to have before the mace
[3:11:27] <SubjectX07x> Greirat starts freed @boostergoldz
[3:11:32] <wantedsafe471> Go jerma
[3:11:34] <+MisterAvry> good Pasta~
[3:11:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> GET HIS ASS, PASTA
[3:11:41] <otakon17> good boy!
[3:11:42] <+Shishi1205> the evangelists
[3:11:45] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> why is it called pasta
[3:11:45] <+Iamdenril> ass blasted a zombie
[3:11:47] <otakon17> Pasta made a meal outta you!
[3:11:52] <roguemephilesclone> Greirat's free, but his treasure room is still there unopened. Pat has the key.
[3:11:52] <+Shishi1205> cut content
[3:11:53] <gespenst25> Is that the giant rat who makes all of da rules?
[3:11:53] <%doomunderthestairs> pasta is the star of this stream
[3:11:53] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> just call it ratatouille like everyone else
[3:12:01] <+Thyzoon> The Axe that was CUT?!
[3:12:11] <+MarkUriah> so what is the gimmick with the green magic? it seems super strong
[3:12:13] <Furtive_Vulpine> yooo
[3:12:15] <otakon17> it's a cool looking axe
[3:12:16] <+ikantreeed> YEEEET
[3:12:16] <+MisterAvry> fucking sick
[3:12:25] <otakon17> damage buff?
[3:12:26] <wantedsafe471> It has DoT effects
[3:12:30] <SubjectX07x> I literally used the evangelist axe for 99% of the game, you start with it if you choose Blood Guard
[3:12:32] <BliVru> The axe scales with your stats
[3:12:32] <AoiRob> oh that axe fucking BANGS
[3:12:33] <%Agami23> oh, thats the axe i use. blood guard starts with it and it does both dark and bleed damage
[3:12:36] <+bluedude153> That axe does sick ass dark damage
[3:12:37] <BliVru> realmy well
[3:12:37] <LunarRemix> @Thyzoon They changed it into a hammer due as it had a better animation for it being an actual hammer
[3:12:42] <%pectusumbra> druid stuff is poison and summons
[3:12:44] <AoiRob> it does blood buildup i think
[3:12:49] <nejtcq> How do you rank the Fromsoft Souls games?
[3:12:49] <%Valdorick> I like every mod that removes this fucking bonfire
[3:12:53] <+MisterAvry> owie
[3:12:54] <%Valdorick> this god damned bonfire that makes NO SENSE
[3:12:56] <otakon17> dagger needs upgrades
[3:13:01] <+Shishi1205> he is carrying asaw
[3:13:02] <oozebear> that's always been like that i thought
[3:13:05] <$Invlux> have they not always? LUL
[3:13:08] <oozebear> i might also be an idiot
[3:13:11] <lliam01> he does that in base game doesn't he?
[3:13:18] <%spitelite> they always did
[3:13:19] <otakon17> enemies are like 300% more aggressive in this mod I swear
[3:13:23] <tolloponik> yep those guys still suck to fight against
[3:13:24] <%Caped_Eggy> He did do that
[3:13:28] <wantedsafe471> Is that what he normally does?
[3:13:30] <BliVru> the axe scales with int and faith
[3:13:31] <lliam01> he might just stagger you in vanilla
[3:13:32] <%TINMANxHMx> I cant remember
[3:13:32] <otakon17> he charges you in the base game but I don't remember CONTACT damgae
[3:13:34] <lliam01> idk
[3:13:42] <BedHome> i wonder how long it will be till moders start chopping and screwing the level design and layouts to make entirely new games
[3:13:43] <Berendenn> how could you not remember that obscure knowledge about the game GOD
[3:13:44] <AoiRob> i just assume that every running enemy is an active hitbox
[3:13:49] <jackistpayne> That will never get old
[3:13:52] <BedHome> turn soulsborne into legboblox
[3:13:55] <SubjectX07x> The axe scales with faith int dex and strength
[3:13:57] <otakon17> schmuck bait!
[3:14:10] <かわいい名前> streamer doesnt have 2k hours in ds3, kinda cringe TPFufun
[3:14:15] <%TINMANxHMx> I dont think I've ever let them hit me in that charge animation now that i think about it
[3:14:17] <+Shishi1205> there's a shiton enemies outside
[3:14:21] <otakon17> okay the corner placement of enemies is getting out of hand, that's just cheap
[3:14:40] <otakon17> oh dude did you ever go back to the cell in the Lothric Walls?
[3:14:42] <lliam01> this is the place where your snipes will be op-est
[3:14:49] <AoiRob> cheeeeeese
[3:14:59] <+MisterAvry> toast it
[3:15:01] <AoiRob> oh no if only you had ashen estus
[3:15:02] <+Shishi1205> dot his ass
[3:15:04] <%Valdorick> 50M hp
[3:15:12] <wantedsafe471> if corner enemies are a bit much, there are a few spell that go through walls
[3:15:14] <roguemephilesclone> Pat did not go back to the cell.
[3:15:20] <otakon17> oh no he has to wait like THIRTY SECONDS to cast again
[3:15:21] <otakon17> the PAIN
[3:15:29] <%Agami23> god i wish i had that easy of a time with those things.
[3:15:33] <+Shishi1205> cell only has items now
[3:15:42] <gespenst25> this seems fine and not a trap
[3:15:52] <otakon17> like his FP recharges to full in no time
[3:15:53] <AoiRob> bless u
[3:15:54] <lliam01> lol
[3:15:57] <+Shishi1205> no missable npcs that are shops
[3:16:09] <+Shishi1205> spells or simillar
[3:16:13] <tolloponik> she has her ax
[3:16:19] <raknikmik> wallhax
[3:16:21] <otakon17> you don't have any crowd control spells though, where are the AoE's and like?
[3:16:28] <+Shishi1205> you have better spells so they do too
[3:16:31] <otakon17> I HATE that attack
[3:16:42] <otakon17> nah she always had that spell
[3:16:45] <+bluedude153> There are stupid big aoe attacks yeag
[3:16:47] <AoiRob> @Shishi1205 there's a pyromancy that's literally a nuke explosion
[3:16:47] <otakon17> but it never inflicted THAT much bleeding before
[3:16:48] <lotusdagoat> damn does this mod also affect the visuals? i dont remember ds3 being this good looking
[3:16:49] <+Shishi1205> @otakon17 for cryo there are so many good ones
[3:17:02] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> Sadge all i hear in my head is "he even came with his chain" when the enemies scream
[3:17:11] <otakon17> @lotusdagoat i siad the same thing
[3:17:18] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 There's a cryo that is just a meteor
[3:17:25] <raknikmik> @lotusdagoat Def does affect visuals.
[3:17:35] <+Shishi1205> @lotusdagoat kinda
[3:17:39] <AoiRob> @lotusdagoat this area doesnt look too different from vanilla but other areas do look significantly better yes
[3:17:40] <otakon17> time to head back and hand that over to the Drood
[3:17:56] <+Shishi1205> it is faster
[3:17:58] <%pectusumbra> man games where poison is actually good are so fun
[3:18:10] <+Shishi1205> bc its a spell you cast now
[3:18:12] <Laecerelius> Hannigan, where are my scissors?!
[3:18:18] <+tempestzephyr> Hit stun
[3:18:18] <かわいい名前> yeah good dots are always fun
[3:18:26] <otakon17> @Laecerelius yeeeeeeeeees
[3:18:40] <wantedsafe471> Pat should of called his character Halligan
[3:18:41] <otakon17> now if only you had a way to keep your HP up without Estus
[3:18:48] <lliam01> The highest dps possible in this mod is a Crystal Sorcery hyper mode build with Crystal Magic Weapon and a dagger, IIRC.
[3:18:49] <+MarkUriah> how many games have good dot that doesnt make the game a cakewalk?
[3:18:50] <+Shishi1205> +80 raw magic is good who would have tought
[3:19:11] <かわいい名前> every time LuL
[3:19:11] <%pectusumbra> gotta roll that one late for sure
[3:19:13] <$chance_h> Time for wolf form soon
[3:19:19] <otakon17> you should upgrade your HP and get some armor soon
[3:19:24] <AoiRob> @otakon17 healing and lifedrain spells say hi
[3:19:26] <%Agami23> it feels like the same tracking. gnawing always had insane tracking
[3:19:35] <otakon17> Paige-o zone

[3:19:41] <Gabbycat> cute :3
[3:19:42] <otakon17> where the "magic"happens

[3:19:56] <Brainhook> Look up at the tree.
[3:19:57] <Furtive_Vulpine> gnawing always had fuckshit tracking yeah but it being super fast makes it even worse im thinking
[3:20:03] <otakon17> ...dammit why am I wishing there was a Diablo game like this?
[3:20:04] <%tank7013> For a second there I thought he said "Keijo zone"
[3:20:13] <MayorRev> The Paige-o Zone is where she draws power from ears and focuses it onto eyes
[3:20:26] <burnmandem> Who else wants Future Souls?!?! Lightsabers n shit
[3:20:28] <+MisterAvry> there was one of those hanging loot bodies in the building you were just in

[3:21:10] <boostergoldz> that's the same r2
[3:21:15] <$chance_h> Magic regen is so good, really adds to the gameplay. Hopefully it’s in base Elden Ring
[3:21:17] <lliam01> it does
[3:21:27] <otakon17> does the dagger POISON?
[3:21:29] <%tank7013> Remember when people would have a meltdown if you so much as glanced at the estoc?
[3:21:31] <burnmandem> @otakon17 yeah it’s called Fallen Order bug exterminator
[3:21:34] <%Movemeister> The Paigeogan lives on, drawing power from all her other senses to enhance her eyesight and concentration
[3:21:36] <boostergoldz> i can understand if you don't recognize it since its only job is pressing r1

[3:28:46] <boostergoldz> you can stack a lot of hp regen
[3:28:50] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt you just need more attunement slots
[3:28:52] <boostergoldz> it's pretty nuts later
[3:28:58] <+Shishi1205> invest in that
[3:28:59] <burnmandem> It’s a temtem
[3:29:04] <%bundle_of_herbs> read spell description on summons
[3:29:05] <%pectusumbra> it's a very little regen
[3:29:08] <roguemephilesclone> Wonder if Regrowth AoEs, because I read the description thus time and it sounds like self-only.
[3:29:14] <otakon17> it looks like about 5 hp per second
[3:29:22] <+Shishi1205> they buffed the speed of the rolly polies

[3:30:09] <%RealThiele> lizard is a bit dumbgus
[3:30:10] <burnmandem> Nothing can stop it once it’s in motion
[3:30:17] <wantedsafe471> Rock Lobster, use Flamethrower

[3:30:21] <otakon17> guys I'm going nuts how am I getting messages from 2 minutes ago?
[3:30:28] <otakon17> well it's at least 90 seconds
[3:30:33] <%dashmatt> dodongu
[3:30:36] <burnmandem> Time travel
[3:30:36] <%dekkitout> It lasts a few, ya know
[3:30:37] <%greasypete00> that dot is just wild
[3:30:41] <otakon17> it JUST ran out
[3:30:47] <CrimsonGargoyle> Rocky BULBoa!!
[3:30:49] <EynoStiles> what happen to the rat?
[3:30:51] <+dcobra22322> @otakon17 Because your nuts... Duh LUL
[3:30:52] <%pectusumbra> okay it ended. also that it also boosts SP regen is WILD
[3:30:53] <boostergoldz> oh it regens stamina too
[3:30:56] <otakon17> 2 minute slow regen ain't bad
[3:30:59] <%Order_of_Mystery> oh hey, regrowth! i remember that was a WoW spell for druids too
[3:31:05] <%joodatious> why do it if ur full helth pat
[3:31:07] <otakon17> AND it boosts SP regen
[3:31:09] <+Shishi1205> binoculars
[3:31:20] <burnmandem> Nocs
[3:31:26] <%bundle_of_herbs> can you stack regrowth like your dots?
[3:31:26] <otakon17> @joodatious pre-emptive healing since it's so slow
[3:31:28] <+AlucardX60> I think SP regen is percentage so the more SP the more SP regen.
[3:31:36] <%tank7013> I always keep a bow on me literally just for items like that
[3:31:37] <%joodatious> fair enough
[3:31:44] <+goingupcast> you're the best
[3:31:45] <burnmandem> Looking like a swampgician
[3:31:45] <@TheYellowcouch> Now that's tank thinking
[3:31:48] <boostergoldz> it's also nice to keep on for stamina regen
[3:31:48] <%joodatious> thats nuts
[3:31:55] <%RealThiele> the sp is great
[3:32:02] <+Shishi1205> attunement is an investment in this mod
[3:32:06] <otakon17> man I want this mod more and more
[3:32:10] <otakon17> DAMN my lack of money
[3:32:13] <%joodatious> this seems like the "everything is broken" kind of mod
[3:32:17] <+Shishi1205> more fp more spell spam
[3:32:22] <otakon17> I like it!
[3:32:31] <+AlucardX60> It's a glass canon kind of mod.
[3:32:38] <+ikantreeed> that shit hurted
[3:32:43] <+Shishi1205> @joodatious ranged is broken bc enemies are busted too
[3:32:45] <+jaco_checkbox> give em the lizard
[3:32:46] <BliVru> Remember the secret warp to the boss arena?
[3:32:48] <wantedsafe471> Shame they didn't make attunement like In ds2, where it also increased cast speed
[3:32:55] <Furtive_Vulpine> seems heavily focused on magic, is there any big changes to like melee in this mod chat
[3:32:58] <otakon17> well the Regrowth is good for INBETWEEN fights
[3:33:01] <otakon17> and LONG fights
[3:33:01] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:33:05] <burnmandem> Unleash da Komodo
[3:33:15] <かわいい名前> people think everything thats not a straight sword is "busted", for what its worth
[3:33:17] <otakon17> @Furtive_Vulpine there's a wiki page for all the changes from the mod site
[3:33:28] <Mister_McDerp> send out charmander
[3:33:41] <otakon17> it does NOT go through walls thankfully
[3:33:51] <otakon17> but yeah a ton of the weapons got new weapon arts too
[3:33:51] <%tank7013> This DoT is nutty
[3:33:56] <%joodatious> is there a way to get all the classes and weapons of this mod but without all the changes to the levels/enemies/bosses?
[3:34:02] <otakon17> covenants got passive bonuses on being in them
[3:34:03] <+Shishi1205> Oh dont worry some spells are floor based ao
[3:34:03] <burnmandem> Ok he isn’t just staring at it. I’m calling an ombudsman for false advertising
[3:34:11] <+Shishi1205> those do go through walls
[3:34:12] <otakon17> I wonder if you can FINALLY upgrade armor though
[3:34:18] <+jaco_checkbox> yay
[3:34:24] <otakon17> Charmander is STUCK
[3:34:28] <wantedsafe471> If you think druid DoT is nuts, do a dark build
[3:34:30] <%joodatious> im personally not a fan of the changes to the overall game but i like the class stuff
[3:34:42] <otakon17> the summons all need a bit of work
[3:34:47] <SubjectX07x> No armor upgrade. @otakon17
[3:34:48] <+jaco_checkbox> I love him anyway
[3:34:50] <Mister_McDerp> charmander is trying his best
[3:34:55] <otakon17> dammit
[3:35:12] <burnmandem> GeoMander
[3:35:17] <%MugenSandan> so what happens if charmander dies does Pat just resummon him or does he have to hit a bonfire
[3:35:17] <%tank7013> Hey if it's a good idea might as well take it
[3:35:19] <%joodatious> developers should always steal from modders
[3:35:21] <otakon17> man who is HYPED for Elden Ring next month?
[3:35:22] <%dekkitout> ER is "We have summon systems at home"
[3:35:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> elden ring steals from modders confirmed
[3:35:22] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt The first thing I did as a cryo was beeline to the dlc to get to the tier 2 covenant. It has an armor that gives extra fp regen
[3:35:24] <%joodatious> ALWAYS
[3:35:24] <+SilverDevilfish> It's a fake
[3:35:26] <Furtive_Vulpine> summoning shit will always kick ass, just gives that feel of power
[3:35:27] <+tempestzephyr> What if Pat was real?
[3:35:29] <BliVru> @patstaresat do you think they took inspiration? i mean theres a ton coincidences?
[3:35:33] <otakon17> @MugenSandan one instance of a summon per rest
[3:35:40] <%spitelite> what if it was big dark souls
[3:35:42] <otakon17> @MugenSandan but you have multiple summons you can slot
[3:35:42] <%G_Thunders> Remember, you’re not allowed to use the spirit summons in elden ring ‘cause having fun means the game is too easy
[3:35:46] <Gabbycat> I wish Pat was real FeelsBadMan PepeHands
[3:35:47] <%alphonseisbest> BEST DS9 EPISODE PERIOD
[3:35:49] <boostergoldz> is it stealing when they make free stuff for your game
[3:35:52] <wantedsafe471> Careful, crazy talk might activate
[3:35:53] <+Aeogard> modders always have the ability to fuck around with stuff that i hope devs of their series really can pick and pull from
[3:36:06] <%joodatious> @BliVru maybe but the idea of summons isn't something modders made
[3:36:16] <otakon17> time to GO BACK and SPEND souls
[3:36:25] <%joodatious> they love western fantasy and there is a good amount of summoning in those
[3:36:29] <otakon17> you need to find the new bonfire
[3:36:31] <Anthrozzz> I’m streaming this too lol
[3:36:38] <+LordGeneric> Having mana regen would really make a mage play better. I should try this out, mage in ds3 hurt me
[3:36:39] <boostergoldz> that works
[3:36:41] <otakon17> phew
[3:36:42] <Furtive_Vulpine> idea of summons is something thats been talked about since the first final fantasy, nothing new
[3:36:43] <Mister_McDerp> lol bye
[3:36:44] <+Shishi1205> huh
[3:36:45] <%epide> in 3

[3:37:05] <%joodatious> yeh
[3:37:05] <+Shishi1205> check ceiling
[3:37:07] <@TheYellowcouch> I was wondering, are the changes to the levels mandatory to these mods or can you just play normal DS3 with the weapon changes?
[3:37:07] <DianaTheAscian> it was in 3 yeah
[3:37:07] <+Aeogard> my guiding moonlight...
[3:37:08] <BluBox> Yes
[3:37:08] <Gabbycat> yep
[3:37:11] <%alphonseisbest> chat did Pat see the news about the NEW Armoured core game?
[3:37:11] <+jaco_checkbox> you basically are a summon in ds
[3:37:11] <BliVru> you ok buddy?
[3:37:12] <%MugenSandan> I do wonder how Summoning in this mod works, because the DS3 engine isn't supposed to be able to handle creating NPCs
[3:37:12] <karl_rex> it was always there
[3:37:16] <+SilverDevilfish> The real kick was the kick we kicked along the kick
[3:37:20] <AoiRob> it was by your side. all along
[3:37:21] <$Invlux> @BliVru my guiding moonlight...
[3:37:21] <%joodatious> it was within you all along patrick

[3:44:55] <%dekkitout> Of course lucky ted is an alchemist
[3:44:56] <%Agami23> you might want to check out the blades yeah
[3:45:08] <Gabbycat> new armour set!
[3:45:08] <+AlucardX60> They scale with luck
[3:45:17] <wantedsafe471> Lucky Ted build.
[3:45:18] <+Thyzoon> Potion Seller, I need your strongest potions, and I'm heading into battle.
[3:45:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The green reminds me of that new disney movie
[3:45:30] <+Bouerd> That's a bloodborne ass moveset
[3:45:35] <+AlucardX60> two hand: R1, L1, R1
[3:45:46] <Furtive_Vulpine> now what is this
[3:45:46] <%Dakuu75> wtf is that
[3:45:47] <%Agami23> it throws knives
[3:45:51] <%Dakuu75> OH
[3:45:54] <boostergoldz> it's like the crow quills weapon art
[3:45:55] <+Shishi1205> dlc corvids style
[3:45:56] <burnmandem> Cheeky stab tho
[3:45:59] <%pectusumbra> yeah you can see them in the wall
[3:45:59] <%meatman_noplan> Oooh
[3:45:59] <Gabbycat> OOUUU
[3:46:02] <+jaco_checkbox> anime
[3:46:08] <+tempestzephyr> naruto it up
[3:46:08] <DianaTheAscian> is that not a dlc weapon?
[3:46:13] <%tank7013> I like that they actually stick around in the wall for a bit
[3:46:16] <%Agami23> alchemist is weird. most of it revolves around using consumable items you can craft
[3:46:20] <Furtive_Vulpine> was this moveset in the game? i never remember seeing something like this
[3:46:24] <%TINMANxHMx> anime souls 3
[3:46:24] <cheapdoc> How's the mod? it looks wacky
[3:46:29] <LoreKeeper_Thal> buppy crap time
[3:46:30] <+ikantreeed> u're puppy?
[3:46:36] <BackflipCharm> Alchemist seems like a build that focuses around item use, with enemies dropping items that can be used to craft all kinds of stuff. With luck as a key stat since it relies ond rops. Seems pretty rad
[3:46:37] <LoreKeeper_Thal> both poop together
[3:46:43] <%TINMANxHMx> pats gotta shit
[3:46:49] <+theoldone001> Pee outside together
[3:47:01] <%Movemeister> Couples who shit together stay together
[3:47:07] <burnmandem> Awww I wanted couch stream
[3:47:13] <+ikantreeed> y'all think gief pick up pat's poop too?
[3:47:17] <burnmandem> Couch is op
[3:47:36] <%tank7013> I'd be willing to bet Gief has attempted that at least once
[3:48:34] <+Shishi1205> the top tier alchemy covenant is in the grand archives btw
[3:49:01] <+Shishi1205> also you can go there straight away
[3:49:13] <+Shishi1205> lothric was the first lord of cinder I killed

[3:49:27] <@Moobot> @HeathCottengim I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 49m.
[3:49:37] <+theoldone001> Does the mod add any new areas at all?
[3:50:40] <+Shishi1205> @theoldone001 yes?
[3:50:43] <+Shishi1205> at least one
[3:50:54] <SubjectX07x> Technically yes but it's big spoilers.
[3:51:05] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[3:51:28] <+Shishi1205> all the zones are changed in some way tho
[3:51:39] <%bravebravesrobin> also, bork at dog, scream at cat, and lightly kiss mustard queen so she doesn't break Cheer500
[3:51:45] <+Shishi1205> like all the bosses too. They have new things to show
[3:52:30] <+theoldone001> Thanks y'all. Gonna download it and try it out tonight
[3:52:34] <SubjectX07x> Technically the big throne in firelink is a spoiler on its own if you read the engraving

[3:54:28] <+AlucardX60> Money's money is all that moneys
[3:54:34] <SubjectX07x> @lizard0tm Bloodborne weapons are in cinders, there are some new weapons here but no bloodborne ones I know of?
[3:54:41] <$Invlux> Is it normal to have to close the downloader for this mod when it gets stuck on 99% or is my download borked
[3:54:45] <+theoldone001> Oh shit the visuals changed too? Looks like an ENB on it or something.
[3:54:54] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt Fun fact there's a ring that gives you more than one slot
[3:55:00] <+Thyzoon> I wonder if we'll make it to the tree this stream
[3:55:07] <+Shishi1205> It is later tho
[3:55:08] <%tank7013> The dogs did not appreciate that you made them stinky
[3:55:28] <+Dr_Healsgood> So does this mod add any new zones?
[3:55:36] <SubjectX07x> Pretty much every single level has had its lighting revamped or some kind of style shift
[3:55:37] <%Lizard0TM> @SubjectX07x Coulda sworn Cinders, Champions Ashes, and Convergence all had Bloodborne weapons, guess they're all melding together in my mind
[3:55:40] <boostergoldz> kind of
[3:55:43] <burnmandem> That’s gonna hurt in the morning
[3:55:52] <+ryham_007> damn, there's some bonkers magic in this
[3:56:03] <+Shishi1205> enemy behind a wall
[3:56:07] <%Lizard0TM> LUL
[3:56:07] <kingra> Good job lizard...
[3:56:10] <+quackisalive> Wild to watch Pat play a mod another streamer I watch works on.
[3:56:11] <Druss_M> dumb lizard
[3:56:13] <terrible35> he saw you, get it
[3:56:15] <%cylish> wow, the health levels on this
[3:56:19] <MyNameIsRasus> don't give up skeleton
[3:56:22] <%Lizard0TM> Get better summons
[3:56:25] <%BigCoffee> The dog was good
[3:56:28] <otakon17> why'd you stay locked on?!
[3:56:30] <%tank7013> The lizard seems a little... unfocused
[3:56:32] <+Shishi1205> I only used summons at bosses
[3:56:32] <burnmandem> Git gud
[3:56:32] <kingra> I think it's just Lizard sucks
[3:56:33] <%Cozy90> get ur shit together rock lobster
[3:56:33] <lliam01> early game summons aren't great
[3:56:34] <+vivivielle> i just tuned in, holy fuck what is this mod LUL
[3:56:37] <%valriot> So whats actually new in this mod?
[3:56:41] <Laecerelius> Lizard big dumbo
[3:56:43] <lliam01> later ones have better ai/stats
[3:56:43] <+Thyzoon> Summons are a miracle they even work at all Pat, at least in singleplayer.
[3:56:52] <SubjectX07x> I've run through both DLC's and the base game, haven't seen any bloodborne weapons sadly. @lizard0tm
[3:56:53] <+Shishi1205> Specially one that is exclusive to cryomancers
[3:56:58] <%BigCoffee> Why don't you use the giga centipede? It's so huge it might tank better
[3:57:04] <MyNameIsRasus> wow the damage
[3:57:10] <LeafarOz> what does convergence change?
[3:57:12] <%Agami23> i went with blood miracles because i didnt want to deal with the summons
[3:57:22] <+theoldone001> I'm assuming you have to play offline or risk getting banned?
[3:57:48] <boostergoldz> yes
[3:57:51] <+Shishi1205> the mod puts you offline
[3:57:59] <%Agami23> @theoldone001 the mod changes the files to make it so you cant go online
[3:58:15] <+Thyzoon> @theoldone001 You can just make a secondary steam profile that shares with your main if you want to co-op with people.
[3:58:36] <boostergoldz> there's a setting in the ini that puts you offline by default so nobody matches up in pvp with vanilla players
[3:58:36] <%ZephynM> After having important NPCs murdered for no reason in my games in the original DS, I want to be offline in these games lol
[3:58:45] <%valriot> OH HE DOIN IT
[3:58:47] <+Shishi1205> enemy behind walls

[3:58:53] <kingra> Lizard seems the big dumb
[3:58:53] <+AlucardX60> The necromancer build lets you summon the big saw guys and they rock.

[3:59:23] <+Jessie_Lockhart> He’s so cute tho
[3:59:25] <%Lizard0TM> that's your fault
[3:59:25] <otakon17> he's doing his best pat, be patient
[3:59:27] <%Agami23> also, you can play online with other people using the mod i think, but you have to be banned
[3:59:27] <Barelyaudible> Wtf is this??
[3:59:33] <+Shishi1205> for bosses imo
[3:59:35] <%pectusumbra> you're the one that picked the stumpy stumbo. you had two horrible abominations to choose from
[3:59:35] <+PrincessLuna85> it looks like they always spawn in sideways as silly as it sounds maybe just cast it facing the wrong way?
[3:59:37] <otakon17> >he's too short so some attacks don't connect
[3:59:37] <%BigCoffee> they are little tanking creature
[3:59:42] <%BigCoffee> if they get attention they win
[3:59:43] <%TINMANxHMx> lmao
[3:59:44] <kingra> Lizard... LUL
[3:59:45] <+Sw3g_J> ya rock lizard u can do it
[3:59:46] <%baka_sugoi> your just a bad pokemon trainer pat LUL
[3:59:47] <%valriot> LUL Feel on his ass
[3:59:48] <%ZephynM> @Lizard0TM There are hacks in Dark Souls 1 that lets people intrude into your game and kill them. It's happened and still does if you're online, though the chances may be slim
[3:59:50] <+jaco_checkbox> I'm poggers for the little birthday boy
[3:59:50] <+pacmanswang> Hes such a dumbass lmao
[3:59:50] <richmon__> I miss the rat
[3:59:52] <%cartakus> Aka summons in ER
[3:59:52] <rosemon5001> i feel like this one got his rolling attack nerfed
[3:59:52] <AoiRob> seems about the same function as elden ring
[3:59:54] <%BigCoffee> And you use your broken poison missile to kill
[3:59:56] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt the Rock Lizard is a defensive summon. The two Grue are both attack summons.
[4:00:00] <+Shishi1205> cross that bridge
[4:00:00] <+AlucardX60> across the bridge
[4:00:04] <+Thyzoon> Ohhhh the soup door?
[4:00:05] <BackflipCharm> This new pokemon game looks wild
[4:00:06] <BliVru> The giant?
[4:00:09] <roguemephilesclone> I'm pretty sure the Rock Lizard isn't actually very good.
[4:00:09] <CrimsonGargoyle> He's like a big rocky Zangeif
[4:00:15] <%BigCoffee> stone lizard does feel defensive
[4:00:16] <dan_g_v> ouch
[4:00:21] <AoiRob> i think it's just the inside of the building past the bridge
[4:00:22] <lliam01> Lategame Necromancers can summon a Darkwraith, and it's AI is SO much better.
[4:00:23] <%BigCoffee> he's a rock zangief yeah
[4:00:30] <%cartakus> How busted can you get in this one?
[4:00:32] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt remember your regen spell
[4:00:35] <+dcobra22322> LUL
[4:00:38] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What?
[4:00:38] <rasamune> Fatty pig lizard
[4:00:42] <%baka_sugoi> has Gief TRIED?
[4:00:43] <LeafarOz> the graveyard where the giant helps you?
[4:00:45] <%cartakus> F
[4:00:48] <%tank7013> I don't think that's normal dog behavior
[4:00:51] <+theoldone001> Is it fan lore or new story
[4:00:52] <+Shishi1205> Np
[4:01:13] <SubjectX07x> hwhut
[4:01:14] <+Shishi1205> yeah thats why tier 2 covenant armors are so needed
[4:01:20] <%Lizard0TM> @ZephynM Ah, I played DS1 on 360, so never had that happen and DSR on pc has mods to counteract annoying hackers if that were to still happen
[4:01:21] <%doubleslapmeharderwhitney> Pat is oblivious to his audience’s overwhelming desire to see him to stream Fromsoft’s best and most functional Souls game, “Evergrace”, but I suppose we’ll settle for some DS3
[4:01:22] <secret_npc> dying light 2 takes 500hrs to fully complete
[4:01:24] <AoiRob> @theoldone001 Pontiff is a Lord of Cinder in this mod
[4:01:24] <Gabbycat> new story would be fan lore
[4:01:33] <%Movemeister> Old story
[4:01:33] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Was Gief trying to steal another dog's balls to replace the ones you stole from him?
[4:01:44] <+Shishi1205> enemy factions
[4:01:47] <%tank7013> Good job idiot
[4:01:58] <%ZephynM> @Lizard0TM Yeah, I play on PC. It sucks but I'm going to try again in offline some time in the future.
[4:02:01] <SubjectX07x> @aoirob That's kind of a spoiler man..
[4:02:05] <+Shishi1205> yep
[4:02:18] <%ZephynM> I've beaten Sekiro and DS3 though. I Just feel like playing the older ones sometimes.
[4:02:23] <AoiRob> @SubjectX07x his Lord Throne is literally in Firelink
[4:02:29] <%dekkitout> @SubjectX07x His name is on a chair, the fuq u mean?
[4:02:41] <tolloponik> can't wait to feel like that again in a few months
[4:02:42] <SubjectX07x> Yeah but you can easily not read that
[4:02:44] <+Shishi1205> not really expanded
[4:02:48] <%epide> that makes sense
[4:02:50] <+Shishi1205> just changed locations
[4:02:52] <Gabbycat> hell yeah
[4:02:55] <$SGrim> @SubjectX07x considering you see who all the Lords of Cinder are in the statues just after the first boss, and his name is in Firelink, not really.
[4:03:00] <otakon17> oh cool MORE bombardment!
[4:03:08] <%Lizard0TM> they just changed where he aims, but it is coll non the less
[4:03:08] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.

[4:04:11] <+b_primeaux> is this on ps5
[4:04:19] <otakon17> man this mod has a LOT of "cheap" tactics in it
[4:04:23] <otakon17> I don't like that
[4:04:26] <%Lizard0TM> Convergence has armor stats right?
[4:04:40] <%cartakus> You're a necromancer?
[4:04:41] <%Lizard0TM> Not Armor stats, bonus stats is what I mean
[4:04:44] <otakon17> too many guys right around corners, too many suckers taking potshots at you out of camera view
[4:04:58] <Druss_M> @cartakus Drood
[4:04:59] <otakon17> yeah bonus stats, mostly with Covenant gear
[4:04:59] <+Shishi1205> dlc
[4:05:07] <otakon17> he's a Drood
[4:05:09] <Gabbycat> from dlc
[4:05:10] <+Shishi1205> the chonky bois
[4:05:11] <lliam01> usually armor has minor abilities
[4:05:13] <%RealThiele> Harold ligma
[4:05:13] <%G_Thunders> That was all in the original game though… like half the chests are mimics
[4:05:15] <Yamchadassist> ooh its a small version of a dlc weapon
[4:05:15] <Gabbycat> it's small now whoa
[4:05:16] <%dekkitout> Harry wanted to ear the Dark Soul ™️
[4:05:18] <lliam01> rather than stats
[4:05:20] <%TINMANxHMx> downsized version of the big one?
[4:05:25] <%tank7013> The tar does in fact scim
[4:05:28] <%Nobrev> leegin skimitar
[4:05:33] <Slim_Lipid> it's no Axatana tho
[4:05:35] <otakon17> it's a standard Curved Sword with a new model
[4:05:40] <+b_primeaux> @RealThiele ligma what?
[4:05:45] <%ZephynM> I might be the most boring person in this mod. I Just love the Hollow Slayer and its style more than everything else i played it
[4:05:45] <+theoldone001> I appreciate the use of the color green
[4:05:49] <%RealThiele> steve jobs
[4:05:52] <Yamchadassist> that reachs LUL
[4:05:52] <+Shishi1205> yep
[4:05:53] <LoreKeeper_Thal> lame it out
[4:05:56] <otakon17> I wonder if Regrowth scales with your INT/FTH?
[4:06:01] <%Lizard0TM> the extended range you get for spells is insane
[4:06:03] <+Fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[4:06:04] <%Nobrev> pat took the spell sniper feat
[4:06:04] <%MidnightBurst12> pew pew

[4:06:13] <$Invlux> Why not? Why shouldn't I snipe an enemy from across the map etalPsycho
[4:06:18] <otakon17> okay this lockon range is a LITTLE ridiculous

[4:07:14] <+Shishi1205> This mod loves doing this
[4:07:15] <%Lizard0TM> YEAH
[4:07:16] <scrumbotime> Oh holy fuck
[4:07:16] <otakon17> DUDE why you gonna chug when he's FIRING?!
[4:07:18] <BliVru> @patstaresat the blood merchant sells te best armor set for your build
[4:07:20] <%cartakus> WOW
[4:07:20] <%dekkitout> A pursuer enemy that's a sniper. Neat.
[4:07:23] <Lefteron> Nvm, just saw equiment
[4:07:26] <%Complete_Phased> Did they make a bridge?
[4:07:33] <otakon17> it's a FULL BRIDGE to the other side now?!
[4:07:46] <otakon17> shortcuts GALORE
[4:07:52] <%Lizard0TM> Not gonna hit that Bonfire?
[4:07:59] <LoreKeeper_Thal> a teat
[4:08:03] <%joodatious> SUCK
[4:08:03] <otakon17> what bonfire?
[4:08:11] <otakon17> it's down across the bridge now
[4:08:13] <%Lizard0TM> broccoli very good for dog
[4:08:14] <%Cozy90> weiners
[4:08:21] <Slim_Lipid> my dad likes to suck the seasoning off of meat before feeding it to our dog :)
[4:08:24] <+theoldone001> That should have been a shortcut to begin with, the later games kind of skimmed on shortcut porn because of the dependence on warping.
[4:08:27] <%Lizard0TM> yeah, the bonfire across the new bridge
[4:08:27] <Skeleton_Sama> Skeleton_Sama subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey pat, I got sick and now I'm stuck at home watching you kill, take my humanity.
[4:08:30] <Lefteron> Like that otter who hates watermelon?
[4:08:34] <tanarath> my aunt's dogs love my arugala. Zangief just needs the food.
[4:08:35] <AoiRob> he must consume
[4:08:40] <rasamune> maybe the *next* bite will be good
[4:08:47] <LoreKeeper_Thal> don't give up, skeleton
[4:08:49] <otakon17> okay this mod is great but the amount of schmuck bait traps and corner enemies is TOO damn high
[4:08:50] <tanarath> Oh, and my spinach.
[4:09:01] <tanarath> Just slice it up very small
[4:09:09] <otakon17> Spinch is full of iron and vitamin A
[4:09:11] <RC_S3kshun8> tongue, but whole
[4:09:28] <%joodatious> there is something really nice feeling in the roll for DS3
[4:09:30] <BliVru> @otakon17 is kinda the only way to balance the magic bullshit u can do
[4:09:30] <SubjectX07x> sad
[4:09:34] <%joodatious> very good feedback
[4:09:37] <AoiRob> use the bridge
[4:09:48] <AoiRob> the boss of this area is very cool
[4:09:51] <%FunkyStreams> FunkyStreams subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Are you playing as a Dankmancer?
[4:09:55] <otakon17> I say go back to the tree and SPEND some souls
[4:09:59] <tanarath> I'd say a quarter to an eighth of an inch or so?
[4:10:02] <otakon17> a Drood
[4:10:04] <SubjectX07x> I really hope pat fight duh boss
[4:10:04] <%tank7013> What was THAT
[4:10:11] <+sundayafternoon1> Vanilla DS3 has plenty of bait. Seems Par for the course
[4:10:24] <otakon17> yeah not THIS much though
[4:10:33] <%joodatious> this mod seems more for people who want strong magic
[4:10:35] <SubjectX07x> Pat is learning the mysteries of the droods
[4:10:38] <%dekkitout> Was that the green doggo in the distance
[4:10:38] <otakon17> I've seen the mod pull the "around the corner" trick so far like a dozen times now
[4:10:51] <otakon17> AND you can level up at any bofnire
[4:11:03] <%Lizard0TM> @joodatious That is EXACTLY what it is because magic in DS3 vanilla is TRASH
[4:11:04] <%G_Thunders> What’s wrong with leveling at bonfires?
[4:11:08] <%G_Thunders> Everyone loved it
[4:11:14] <SubjectX07x> @joodatious The mod is big on spellblade/battlemages
[4:11:28] <%joodatious> @joodatious yeah but it seems like at the expense of other classes
[4:11:29] <otakon17> you need HP 666
[4:11:35] <otakon17> Mr. Devil
[4:11:48] <otakon17> and CORNER trap again
[4:11:50] <+Shishi1205> RAT
[4:11:55] <LoreKeeper_Thal> rrrato
[4:12:04] <%dekkitout> Big rat! D:
[4:12:11] <%shurtal> reverse rat position sounds like a yoga pose
[4:12:15] <%FunkyStreams> dank
[4:12:15] <ShinyVagikarp> nice
[4:12:23] <%Agami23> they changed the bite rings by the way
[4:12:24] <+dcobra22322> @shurtal LUL
[4:12:26] <boostergoldz> check out the description on the bloodbite ring
[4:12:27] <lliam01> lol yoga
[4:12:29] <+Pharmakokinetic> @shurtal I think it sounds like a Deathcore band name
[4:12:30] <otakon17> the big rat that makes all the rules!
[4:12:30] <+tempestzephyr> nice
[4:12:31] <LoreKeeper_Thal> "omae wa already dead"
[4:12:32] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Lol
[4:12:32] <+RemedyofRevenge> choesebite ring
[4:12:39] <+Thyzoon> IMMUNITY
[4:12:39] <%cartakus> Is there any draw backs with the covenant pat has?
[4:12:41] <%hewlettfan96> How we all doing
[4:12:42] <+Shishi1205> ye
[4:12:43] <%Agami23> yeah
[4:12:44] <%epide> some changes they made just make alot of sense and aslo it was on both sides before
[4:12:46] <%tank7013> That's a pretty big upgrade damn
[4:12:47] <%joodatious> cheese ring
[4:12:50] <otakon17> they made the sewer LONGER
[4:12:51] <%epide> also
[4:12:58] <+Shishi1205> @cartakus no? why put drawbacks to covenants
[4:13:00] <otakon17> IMMUNITY
[4:13:02] <otakon17> THANK GOD
[4:13:04] <%Lizard0TM> they didn't make it longer
[4:13:08] <%dekkitout> Curse immunity ring for the bad fart gas
[4:13:08] <%Lizard0TM> they moved the fog
[4:13:09] <+Thyzoon> Farron Swamp about to be bearable
[4:13:11] <%Bt_Robot> Bt_Robot converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[4:13:12] <%Agami23> so obivously the poison one is baller
[4:13:14] <%cartakus> For fun?
[4:13:30] <%hewlettfan96> Does the covegence mod make the game even harder?
[4:13:32] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt meber for an invasion btw
[4:13:36] <otakon17> man only thing missing is the Rusted Iron Ring so you can move regular speed in water
[4:13:40] <+Shishi1205> ember
[4:13:42] <krionik77> wait, go talk to giant.
[4:13:43] <+pacmanswang> The game seems so much easier with infinite magic.
[4:13:46] <+Thyzoon> Convergence seems much more centered around fun than Cinders imo
[4:13:48] <otakon17> those big lads are WAY too fast now
[4:13:56] <%Lizard0TM> NPC invasions will always be where they are
[4:13:59] <%joodatious> the game seems way easier to the point where they had to make more bullshit corner enemies
[4:14:03] <%hewlettfan96> Also what is the hardest Dark souls Games overall? I’m a newbie and I wanna get into the games
[4:14:06] <+Shishi1205> new invasions do not require embers but old ones do
[4:14:24] <%Lizard0TM> WOLF
[4:14:25] <%joodatious> @hewlettfan96 it depends where you start
[4:14:34] <+Thyzoon> Doom Eternal dog shows up once more
[4:14:36] <otakon17> >invasions that happen whether embered or not
[4:14:37] <Yamchadassist> doggo left a item
[4:14:37] <otakon17> I don't like that
[4:14:41] <+Shishi1205> go near the bonfire?
[4:14:41] <%joodatious> for most people their hardest souls game is their first one
[4:14:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> More like Hoedrick amirite
[4:14:43] <%hewlettfan96> @joodatious Well from the first game ofc
[4:14:45] <otakon17> what is that gren thing
[4:14:49] <otakon17> ohno
[4:14:51] <ape_hawk> did pat get the dussy yet?
[4:14:52] <Gabbycat> haha literally the dog from doom eternal
[4:14:57] <otakon17> what was THAT?!
[4:14:58] <%tank7013> So was that a "Oh you're cool Imma head out" howl or a "get his ass" howl?
[4:15:03] <+Shishi1205> he is a finnicky bitch
[4:15:07] <gespenstkick> Wew dat FP regen
[4:15:11] <+GrampsGrubberfly> does he spawn when you enter the house? or am i a big dumb idiot
[4:15:12] <%Braggardt> I wasn't able to get Hodrick to spawn here either
[4:15:16] <%joodatious> @hewlettfan96 not everyone starts at the first
[4:15:26] <%tank7013> Huh?
[4:15:27] <arduousScavenger> Yoooo
[4:15:28] <otakon17> probablby need to rest at the bonfire first to reset the encounter
[4:15:30] <%Braggardt> Stealth covenant!
[4:15:34] <%JoshManVGH> Are we not gonna talk about the spectral wolf?
[4:15:35] <+Shishi1205> yeah tier 2 covenant
[4:15:36] <%dekkitout> We cutting off ring fingers??
[4:15:37] <LoreKeeper_Thal> neeenja
[4:15:39] <AoiRob> dex covenant
[4:15:41] <otakon17> that chest looks important
[4:15:42] <%epide> yo what
[4:15:47] <%hewlettfan96> @joodatious Oh right argue the games pretty much interchangeable can u play any one
[4:16:07] <Gabbycat> intentionally left thatitrm there or..?
[4:16:08] <twoah> Hail Sithis!
[4:16:10] <otakon17> so THAT is the Assassin's covenant
[4:16:13] <Gabbycat> that item*
[4:16:15] <otakon17> speedy mcninja, acquired
[4:16:16] <%hewlettfan96> Neeenja
[4:16:18] <%cartakus> What is the str covenant?
[4:16:25] <%joodatious> @hewlettfan96 thats not at all what i said but alright
[4:16:32] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[4:16:33] <%hewlettfan96> What with this green aura
[4:16:35] <otakon17> abuse that geometry!
[4:16:36] <+Shishi1205> giant clan
[4:16:36] <SubjectX07x> I legit don't think it ever tells you when an NPC invades, I never saw a single invasion notification for npcs in my playthrough.
[4:16:42] <krionik77> pat, you missed an item.
[4:16:45] <otakon17> seriously all the enemies are SO GODDAMN FAST now
[4:16:47] <AoiRob> @cartakus Giant's Clan or smth like that, in front of where you first meet Anri
[4:16:47] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @hewlettfan96 fart gas
[4:16:57] <BliVru> @patstaresat The bow is really good for your build
[4:17:02] <%RealThiele> glimmering cocaine
[4:17:07] <%hewlettfan96> @joodatious Sorry I know, I mean do they play the later one cause they’re better?
[4:17:07] <+Shishi1205> the giatn clan has all BK weapons
[4:17:10] <otakon17> mm a coffe
[4:17:10] <Gabbycat> <3 <3 same
[4:17:12] <+Shishi1205> and Ledos great hammer
[4:17:13] <%cartakus> cool, HUGH quest
[4:17:13] <scrumbotime> So early in yours, so late in hers
[4:17:15] <%tank7013> Awww
[4:17:17] <+Shishi1205> havels too I thinl
[4:17:21] <@Ranryu692> did you just call Dark Souls your "soul mate?"
[4:17:22] <Rionxgarland> Zangief?
[4:17:23] <@PeachSaliva> @scrumbotime wow
[4:17:26] <AoiRob> @hewlettfan96 that's the effect for druid type magic
[4:17:28] <otakon17> check up above
[4:17:28] <@PeachSaliva> Lol
[4:17:32] <%Braggardt> I played through this game as a fire build the other day. The boss weapon from the Watchdog is excellent
[4:17:33] <%hewlettfan96> @lorekeeper_thal Ew lmao
[4:17:33] <Gabbycat> jesus scrum
[4:17:37] <%G_Thunders> The enemy attacks aren’t faster, it just seems like some of them run to you faster now. Which makes sense with the cast range increase
[4:17:39] <smartbrute1> i think armor has special bonuses
[4:17:42] <+theoldone001> John Leguizamo?
[4:17:43] <Arweynn> something something souless gingers joke
[4:17:44] <%cartakus> Bushemi?
[4:17:44] <Rionxgarland> Zangief is pats soulmate
[4:17:49] <AoiRob> dripless
[4:17:51] <otakon17> just a shard, no biggie
[4:17:56] <%joodatious> @hewlettfan96 i dunno some people just get in on weird times i guess. most people just play whats more recent due to quality of life changes
[4:18:01] <otakon17> and ambush triggered
[4:18:03] <+Shishi1205> armor does have things yes
[4:18:18] <+Shishi1205> some armors give weapon art fp reduction etc
[4:18:19] <pacibuddy> this mod seems to make you a little overpowered
[4:18:19] <otakon17> a Whip!
[4:18:23] <+RemedyofRevenge> did they rebalance the whip moveset to make it more use able?
[4:18:24] <otakon17> now you can be Simon Belmont!
[4:18:36] <%tank7013> Amazing situational awareness on that guy
[4:18:48] <+jaco_checkbox> you can be Earnest Evans
[4:18:48] <boostergoldz> they made it faster
[4:18:50] <otakon17> I don't know
[4:18:52] <%tank7013> It seems faster at least?
[4:18:54] <+tempestzephyr> Seems faster
[4:18:57] <%Lizard0TM> whip is faster
[4:18:59] <+Shishi1205> zoey's whip hits super hard
[4:18:59] <%hewlettfan96> @joodatious What do u mean quality of life changes? The game quality? Dark souls 3 is the most popular but the best seems to be the OG second is the worst comparatively speaking
[4:19:02] <AoiRob> @pacibuddy dont worry it starts ramping up in difficulty
[4:19:03] <otakon17> MUCH FASTER
[4:19:06] <+Thyzoon> Pretty sure most weapons are viable in Convergence
[4:19:14] <%hewlettfan96> Whipped cream
[4:19:15] <otakon17> like a PROPER Belmont
[4:19:15] <@TheYellowcouch> if only we had a whip in 14, best castlevania game
[4:19:20] <%cartakus> For real the anime ruins any wip weapon
[4:19:22] <otakon17> use a throwing knife
[4:19:29] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i'm playing Harmony of Dissonance right now for the first time.
[4:19:36] <+Shishi1205> there's a soul weapon too
[4:19:40] <+Fetrigon> but whips were made for stationary opponents that can't fight back LUL
[4:19:41] <%hewlettfan96> Have there been many 3D castlevania games?
[4:19:52] <otakon17> a few
[4:19:54] <JayEarly> the modder really hated how underpowered magic was huh
[4:19:55] <otakon17> like, four
[4:20:00] <LoreKeeper_Thal> mmmmmmm soup
[4:20:01] <%dekkitout> Estus soup PogChamp
[4:20:10] <%cartakus> @fetrigon bruh lol
[4:20:14] <otakon17> Bloodborne's Cainhurst Castle was the closest NEWEST thing we've gotten to a 3D Castlevania I think
[4:20:19] <%dekkitout> Fingers crossed for elden ring
[4:20:24] <%BigCoffee> its better in 3 then in 2 for sure
[4:20:30] <Yamchadassist> not olny unviable in ds3 but also unfun
[4:20:31] <%valriot> something something elden ring
[4:20:32] <%joodatious> @hewlettfan96 thats more of a personal thing. the first dark souls is arguably the most unfinished and has a much more poor second half and alot of things people appreciate from DS3 turns people off from playing the older ones like moving while drinking estus
[4:20:33] <+Thyzoon> Does magic in Elden Ring feel better?
[4:20:35] <boostergoldz> magic is good once you get all the tools it needs
[4:20:38] <otakon17> SEE another corner ambush
[4:20:41] <%hewlettfan96> How many inventory slots do u get? Compared to something like Skyrim?
[4:20:42] <DianaTheAscian> moders kinda go overboard with magic tbh
[4:20:43] <%BigCoffee> except faith
[4:20:45] <+GrampsGrubberfly> you can make magic balanced if the game is balanced 4Head
[4:20:45] <%tank7013> Dark magic in 2 is fuck busted
[4:20:45] <%joodatious> @Thyzoon YES
[4:20:48] <boostergoldz> which is sage ring +2
[4:20:50] <BackflipCharm> Weren't miracles super busted in 2 at first?
[4:20:50] <AoiRob> u get some busted melee weapons here dw
[4:20:51] <%joodatious> its fucking huge big
[4:20:51] <%valriot> magic is strong, FAITH is the shit one
[4:20:54] <otakon17> infinite inventory
[4:20:55] <%epide> no pat it took a HUGE nerf
[4:20:56] <%Braggardt> The warp spells make for a really fun melee build in this
[4:20:56] <%cartakus> The first magick in ER was busted as shit for the text
[4:20:58] <josh813318> they nefd them
[4:21:00] <otakon17> you only have equip load to worry about
[4:21:01] <%Agami23> you can one shot the giant lord with climax in 2
[4:21:03] <%Lizard0TM> @otakon17 most of these are default enemy placement
[4:21:05] <otakon17> and that only affects your dodge
[4:21:07] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @BackflipCharm it was, lightning was broken
[4:21:07] <JayEarly> are hexes still strong after the nerf
[4:21:08] <%BigCoffee> yeah but what if I don,t wanna do hexes, and prefer sorcery or pyro or faith
[4:21:10] <DianaTheAscian> I wish faith was good
[4:21:13] <otakon17> Hexes were SO good in 2
[4:21:16] <tanarath> Miracles in 2 were great tool they were nerfed completely.
[4:21:17] <+Shishi1205> If elden ring does not have a way to regen magic man...
[4:21:17] <%joodatious> magic in any game is busted if its actually worth using
[4:21:23] <AoiRob> to da boss do it coward
[4:21:23] <lliam01> Demon's Souls was the height of magic's power in the Soulsborne games, but DS2 is a close second.
[4:21:23] <smartbrute1> is faith any good ds3?
[4:21:26] <%Lizard0TM> @otakon17 Pat is also coming through this area backwards
[4:21:32] <boostergoldz> sorcery is one of the top tier dueling builds because homing soul mass is broken
[4:21:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Agami23 that can't be interpreted as a euphemism, no sir.
[4:21:37] <%JoshManVGH> I'm looking forward to what disgusting power stance stuff people can do in Elden Ring
[4:21:40] <otakon17> @Lizard0TM they aren't because I just played DKS3 a short while ago, they didn't have so many around corners and in front of doors like this
[4:21:41] <%joodatious> @smartbrute1 only for paladin stuff
[4:21:42] <%tank7013> @BigCoffee Then perish
[4:21:44] <+Tucker0603> I just wanna be a paladin
[4:21:46] <%dekkitout> @smartbrute1 Unmodded. Phuq no
[4:21:46] <Tracazoid> It'll start good, then they'll nerf it into the ground
[4:21:46] <+Shishi1205> Hodrick really borked huh
[4:21:46] <%hewlettfan96> @joodatious Is estus like a power up required to stop keep dying??
[4:21:47] <%cartakus> There will most lickly be a weapon that regens mp
[4:21:49] <%joodatious> aka big lightning sword melee bro
[4:21:51] <%StebTheVee> Faith in Elden Rinhas fire and lightinng.
[4:21:52] <luciluxlu0> how long tell magic is nerfed in elden ring?
[4:21:56] <%Agami23> faith in this is baller as fuck. blood miracles alone are amazing
[4:21:57] <unfathomarble> oh ye of little faith
[4:21:57] <otakon17> Faith better be good, I wanna go mace and shield babeee
[4:21:59] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt try sitting at the bonfire?
[4:22:01] <Yamchadassist> gross ass moist hollows
[4:22:02] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt pyro spells are now Faith in ER so that should make it viable from the getgo :v
[4:22:09] <otakon17> it's the ZOMBIES
[4:22:09] <%Order_of_Mystery> i hope the dragon form returns in elden ring and is good
[4:22:10] <+GrampsGrubberfly> the lighting stake spell in the game clipped me thru the ground on final boss. very pog if you ask me
[4:22:10] <%cartakus> Also pyro and miracles are the same now, it seems
[4:22:11] <%hewlettfan96> What is estus exactly? A magic power u
[4:22:11] <LoreKeeper_Thal> oof
[4:22:12] <lliam01> My first Elden Ring character is gonna be STR/FTH with dragon miracles and dual-wield axes!
[4:22:13] <twoah> I’m planning to go str/fth on my first run. Mostly for pyro though
[4:22:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> Damn, raw command grab
[4:22:13] <%tank7013> Oh hey that's fucked ip
[4:22:14] <%hewlettfan96> Up
[4:22:14] <%joodatious> @cartakus its the main way to gain health
[4:22:15] <otakon17> FINALLY a torch
[4:22:16] <Gabbycat> LUL
[4:22:23] <+theoldone001> Been playing through SMTV lately, shit's so good
[4:22:24] <otakon17> OH GOD
[4:22:28] <ChineseNininga> you can infuse the torch in different element to change the color of its glow
[4:22:29] <%Lizard0TM> @otakon17 enemies moved towards the door
[4:22:32] <otakon17> BAD TOUCH, BAD TOUCH!
[4:22:33] <ape_hawk> carim abdul jabar
[4:22:35] <%joodatious> it always bugged me how the magic on your staff comes out from like the middle part. it always looks off to me
[4:22:38] <krionik77> pat you've missed an item 3 times in that house at the bottom of the left end.
[4:22:42] <unfathomarble> good thing you got IMMUNITY TO BLEED
[4:22:46] <%hewlettfan96> What a horrible creature

[4:23:50] <%hewlettfan96> Some guy actually completed the OG dark souls with the most difficult control scheme of the rock band 3 periphal I’m not fucking joking LUL LUL LUL
[4:23:53] <twoah> VATS wolf is best boy
[4:23:54] <rosemon5001> didnt the wolf drop something before? when it was on the ledge?
[4:23:55] <%joodatious> get fucked
[4:23:55] <otakon17> ooh Hunter's Ring
[4:24:01] <JayEarly> it is really hard to balance magic like wizards are either the best class in spite of their serious downsides or magic is just trash it seems
[4:24:12] <unfathomarble> hey it's that updog
[4:24:19] <%hewlettfan96> Are those like the undead?
[4:24:24] <BackflipCharm> Nah I saw a guy beat dark souls with a baby in a blender
[4:24:27] <otakon17> I'm all for breaking the game
[4:24:28] <+GrampsGrubberfly> putting maggot men in the graveyard is themeatically correct SeemsGood
[4:24:39] <otakon17> those are the undead from further on in the Cathedral
[4:24:47] <%JoshManVGH> but why do their gut bacteria gotta fight you?
[4:24:47] <%joodatious> @JayEarly that seems to be how it is in most games or tabletop games
[4:24:52] <otakon17> the ones infested with maggots
[4:24:59] <%cade_calrayn> not if he gets the knife, Pat
[4:25:01] <MoonlightWolves> Anyone else randomly having the last few seconds replay?
[4:25:02] <otakon17> huh no cleric stuff
[4:25:09] <%cade_calrayn> we know he already has a penchant for weaponry
[4:25:11] <%cartakus> He can pee in your box
[4:25:12] <Gabbycat> D:
[4:25:13] <otakon17> oh THERE is the Cleric stuff
[4:25:16] <%pectusumbra> hahahaha
[4:25:19] <%Futurecity10> just encountered spider swarms in Pathfinder, glad I brought 42 vials of acid with me
[4:25:20] <%joodatious> magic is either underwhelming trash like in dark souls or absolute world killers like dragons dogma
[4:25:21] <twoah> Gief will just SPD the box open
[4:25:25] <%hewlettfan96> @backflipcharm Was that DSP? Ayy overused joke
[4:25:28] <Arweynn> knifedog

[4:26:24] <otakon17> the jump near the cliff apparently
[4:26:27] <SubjectX07x> Time for DROOD
[4:26:27] <%hax_metatron> Bloodborne magic is fine but any mechanic that has to wait TILL NEAR END GAME to be VIABLE is nonsense.

[4:34:12] <Zombrocom> Green magic does dot, just like yours
[4:34:12] <pabloelenano2> the dots from his spell is the same as yours
[4:34:12] <SaltyAzteca> This is your father
[4:34:14] <%Nobrev> he has poison magic too
[4:34:14] <%bundle_of_herbs> yeah

[4:34:27] <%epide> swoul pat

[4:34:30] <+HuoShengdi> Deer dad
[4:34:34] <+Shishi1205> he built diff fr fr
[4:34:35] <tanarath> Each of those green orbs AND his melees poison
[4:34:35] <+bluedude153> Unfortunatly you gotta beat him if you want the best druid spells
[4:34:35] <BackflipCharm> The cooler you
[4:34:36] <otakon17> it's Poison but NO stat buildup
[4:34:37] <JayEarly> why don't you summon your pets before starting the fight?
[4:34:39] <SaltyAzteca> WE HAVE LORE BASED FIGHTS LUL
[4:34:42] <lliam01> If you wanna see a really cool clip of this boss in particular; ***
[4:34:42] <%JoshManVGH> Patron vs Cooler Patron.
[4:34:43] <%cartakus> "Druid something something"
[4:34:49] <ChineseNininga> there can only be one cool green magic man
[4:34:53] <%Agami23> theres a moment for a few of the classes where you fight bosses that are "you but better" and its always hype
[4:34:53] <AoiRob> you got a sick vergil battle in your dark souls mod
[4:34:56] <otakon17> There can only be ONE Drood!
[4:35:03] <badluckwarlock> time to install this mod dope as hell looking
[4:35:03] <+Shishi1205> Dude the Cryo boss fight is super rad too
[4:35:09] <Treasure_Vault> Lol, fair
[4:35:11] <+trackles_64> THats fine he says
[4:35:16] <JayEarly> ah that makes sense
[4:35:18] <vile_brand> you missed an item near the stairs
[4:35:22] <boostergoldz> souls farming is so easy in this mod they don't matter
[4:35:24] <%dekkitout> Summons have 1 life per bonfire rest and Caimar will body them
[4:35:28] <AoiRob> you can grind the watchdog or vordt lmao
[4:35:33] <+Shishi1205> dead
[4:35:36] <otakon17> one, screw Living FLame Arc because you can't really get in melee with this guy
[4:35:37] <かわいい名前> is that slide from abyss watchers
[4:35:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> We believe in you Patron of the Dank Forest
[4:35:38] <Idon__> holy SHIT
[4:35:38] <+trackles_64> lost the synergy
[4:35:42] <Idon__> this guy aint playing around
[4:35:46] <BliVru> leave him for later he is mid game
[4:35:46] <+Shishi1205> wolf and other conjurations dot
[4:35:47] <SubjectX07x> Out of all the modded bosses, only the champion gravetender replacement felt weak to me.
[4:35:47] <zhenthrim213> snap your dead
[4:35:47] <AoiRob> get dotted loser
[4:35:48] <lliam01> Anything green hits you, you're on a timer.
[4:35:49] <%pectusumbra> OH YEAH. you get hit by one of those spells you just die
[4:35:50] <otakon17> HEAL
[4:35:52] <tolloponik> wow he was pissed that time
[4:35:54] <BackflipCharm> He's got some hyper aggro AI
[4:35:54] <%JoshManVGH> New strat, don't get touched
[4:35:55] <%cartakus> What number is this convergence?
[4:35:59] <%vivaldiva> the clicking of the fingers when he spawns shit is such a nice touch
[4:36:03] <otakon17> you GOTTA heal when you get hit with is magic or the dot will KILL YOU
[4:36:06] <SubjectX07x> 2.1
[4:36:07] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt being embered helps
[4:36:09] <Treasure_Vault> @SubjectX07x Weaker than Champion Gravetender?
[4:36:11] <otakon17> or cast Regrowth to counter the Dot
[4:36:13] <vile_brand> item
[4:36:14] <krionik77> you keep forgetting embers as well pat.
[4:36:15] <SaltyAzteca> Its Owl and Iudex
[4:36:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> does healing even do anything though?
[4:36:22] <%cartakus> only 2.1 wow
[4:36:29] <+Shishi1205> yeah owl is apparent
[4:36:30] <otakon17> yeah it counters the Dot
[4:36:36] <tanarath> Pat needs anti-poison
[4:36:39] <JayEarly> @vivaldiva that's kind of shit that makes me fall in love with spellcasters after being a warrior main as a kid
[4:36:40] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i want fan art of your drood clicking his fingers and it summons gief to slobber on people
[4:36:40] <%joodatious> atleast your dots are doing good damage
[4:36:43] <otakon17> Ember and use Regrowth to counter his DoT damage some
[4:36:58] <otakon17> it's not Poison though, it's a unique DoT with NO stat build up that's inherent to the spells
[4:37:12] <otakon17> even ONE hit is enough to double the damage he took form it
[4:37:16] <SubjectX07x> @treasure_vault It's literally a suped up version of one of the crow knights from Corvian settlement with the big wolf.. it's preeetty meh for a replacement.
[4:37:19] <%ZephynM> I am getting some strong "Owl" vibes from this guy
[4:37:28] <+Shishi1205> heal
[4:37:31] <%hax_metatron> I honestly love that Pat picked a Druid and the first big chad boss is a Druid, his Soul also gets you great shit
[4:37:39] <Treasure_Vault> @SubjectX07x Yeah, sounds weak.
[4:37:42] <%Lizard0TM> it's almost like he uses owl animations
[4:37:44] <%dekkitout> This man is built to dish out true combos
[4:37:44] <%joodatious> kinda wish his model could of been a bit more unique
[4:37:46] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> This dude is cool
[4:37:46] <%joodatious> but y know
[4:37:46] <%greasypete00> was that the Andre kick?
[4:37:48] <+bluedude153> @ZephynM man it would be crazy if multiple sekiro bosses were just in this mod : )
[4:37:49] <%ZephynM> Some of his moves remind me of Owl in Sekiro
[4:37:50] <%cartakus> Rip
[4:37:53] <SaltyAzteca> "The master's will is absolute!"
[4:38:03] <%bundle_of_herbs> dodging towards the missiles helped me a lot
[4:38:03] <+Shishi1205> yeah you'll like what his soul gives you
[4:38:05] <%ZephynM> bluedude153 It would be awesome. I'd try it.
[4:38:07] <vile_brand> @PatStaresAt theres an item near the boss stairs if you didnt see it
[4:38:09] <fojidoj> “One!”
[4:38:13] <otakon17> @ZephynM it's literally Owl's model and moveset
[4:38:14] <BackflipCharm> You're losing because you don't bring Pasta
[4:38:15] <%cartakus> Andre has a drop kick, that was gundyr
[4:38:16] <%ZephynM> I liked DS3 and Sekiro. I wanna play Elden Ring next month.
[4:38:19] <+Shishi1205> gonna have to beat him a more than once
[4:38:19] <SubjectX07x> @treasure_vault The other 6 or so replacements though are fantastic, this guy included
[4:38:19] <AoiRob> @ZephynM yea they ported some sekiro animations for this mod
[4:38:24] <+bluedude153> @ZephynM good news
[4:38:26] <lliam01> yeyeyeye
[4:38:27] <Zombrocom> Oh yeah I see that
[4:38:28] <+Aeogard> skyrim magic mods could be SO cool
[4:38:29] <JayEarly> @vile_brand is that not his bloodstain
[4:38:31] <%dekkitout> How so? Cause Enairim's mods slap
[4:38:31] <tolloponik> wait thats maiden Astrias remake theme and it Fits the Fight instead of the des remake
[4:38:34] <otakon17> @ZephynM Sekrio and DKS3 share the same engine, it's not surprising they could put assets from one to the other in it
[4:38:37] <%ZephynM> otakon17 Oh okay. That makes sense then. I didn't recognize it being Owl because of the bald head
[4:38:41] <%joodatious> lmao
[4:38:50] <+bluedude153> Wasnt there a complete overhaul for ds1 that just came out?
[4:38:51] <+Shishi1205> yeah the ost is good
[4:38:51] <+trackles_64> why not 200?
[4:38:52] <vile_brand> @JayEarly it was the monacle he just picked up\
[4:38:54] <$SophiaAmoreaVeritas> But spellz tho
[4:38:55] <%epide> summon bow is sick thou
[4:38:56] <%hax_metatron> @tolloponik LUL ACCURATE
[4:38:58] <fojidoj> Yeah that’s a fair comparison
[4:38:58] <%dekkitout> Ocato's Recital Kreygasm
[4:38:59] <%cartakus> This reminds me of people putting dark souls combat into skyrim
[4:39:04] <otakon17> DO YOU WANNA HAVE A HUNDRED SPELLS?!
[4:39:04] <かわいい名前> fun magic? in my fromsoftware game?????
[4:39:11] <%KnifeyMcEdge> *poke
[4:39:12] <otakon17> when Pat becomes Spamton
[4:39:13] <%epide> plus the naplom spell from that one mod
[4:39:13] <%joodatious> a million spells that mostly do the same thing lol
[4:39:15] <%cartakus> great start
[4:39:16] <churropoppa> Elden Ring pre order gang hasBuff
[4:39:20] <otakon17> also that kick does like 300 damage
[4:39:28] <+trackles_64> THis is reworked Gundyr?
[4:39:29] <+bluedude153> Oh boo Dark SOuls Nightfall got delated
[4:39:37] <Treasure_Vault> Thanks for whoever mentioned Andre's dropkick, just youtubed it and it's pretty sick.
[4:39:42] <otakon17> I think running forward will throw off the homing of the bullets too
[4:39:42] <+bluedude153> @trackles_64 owl
[4:39:44] <+Shishi1205> gundyr + owl
[4:39:44] <SubjectX07x> Oh yeah has pat kicked an enemy yet?
[4:39:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> woolie may love this fight
[4:39:48] <+twohitgood> goddammit i missed the announce. i'm guessing this is the tail-end of the stream.
[4:39:51] <+evilmagetim> the wolf snap is sick as hell
[4:39:57] <SaltyAzteca> @trackles_64 Gundyr and Owl
[4:39:59] <otakon17> no Pat has not kicked anyone yet
[4:40:03] <+GrampsGrubberfly> wait does poison stack?
[4:40:04] <%TINMANxHMx> when was Elden Ring supposed to release again? Mid Feb?
[4:40:08] <%Lizard0TM> his snap summon is so cool
[4:40:09] <SubjectX07x> If you kick in this mod it launches weak enemies.
[4:40:12] <%TINMANxHMx> I need to put in vacation for it
[4:40:15] <JayEarly> I get why they made things simpler in Skyrim but I don't get making magic not being able to do anything cool
[4:40:18] <SubjectX07x> It's hilarious
[4:40:19] <BliVru> @patstaresat come back later?
[4:40:19] <moonmintparadise> @TINMANxHMx 25
[4:40:20] <lliam01> it aint poison
[4:40:21] <%joodatious> there really should be more cancelable animations
[4:40:21] <%TINMANxHMx> thanks pat!
[4:40:22] <+trackles_64> Delayed till 2022 XD
[4:40:25] <+Aeogard> aint soon enough LUL
[4:40:30] <+GrampsGrubberfly> elden ring will release eventually TM
[4:40:31] <%BigCoffee> WAIT REALLY!? THATS MY BIRTHDAY
[4:40:33] <lliam01> poison still exists, and is completely different
[4:40:34] <otakon17> in SIX WEEKS
[4:40:39] <otakon17> end of next month
[4:40:40] <BackflipCharm> Could also grab the druid gear that lowers your FP costs since you have essence shards
[4:40:41] <+Shishi1205> pat will like the rewardss
[4:40:41] <%G_Thunders> So it’ll release in May
[4:40:44] <otakon17> thank god it's a short month
[4:40:44] <+Aeogard> yeah you almost one shot it @PatStaresAt
[4:40:46] <storytayl0r> Was the music for that a remix of the Maiden Astrae fight?
[4:40:48] <%TINMANxHMx> pog
[4:40:48] <wiDOPANos> yeah just hand peach the controller
[4:40:50] <DXLelouch24> Pat are you gonna play the RE4 HD mod next month? its will finally be out
[4:40:50] <%joodatious> @JayEarly because todd unironically doesn't care about magic builds and the game was made around melee
[4:40:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> But why simply "do it" when you can "crush it" later?
[4:40:52] <Geoblood> what does this convergence mod do?
[4:40:53] <%ZephynM> Feb 24. Man, wish it wasn't so far away but I can wait.
[4:40:53] <%KnifeyMcEdge> it's not my birthday!
[4:40:54] <%cartakus> Master will go down
[4:40:55] <otakon17> yeah it was
[4:41:01] <%BigCoffee> gonna elden ring it  up :3
[4:41:02] <+twohitgood> "this is totally doable" is the pure essencce of souls games.
[4:41:03] <%BigCoffee> And thanks Pat
[4:41:04] <AoiRob> @bluedude153 hey man the devs deserve to take their time with the project
[4:41:08] <SuperGoblinPunch> You said that you think it wont
[4:41:08] <moonmintparadise> my vacation starts at that day for a full week
[4:41:09] <%Agami23> i came back for him later because my build had alot more problems dealing with his essence bullshit
[4:41:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> let Pat play please. I took a pain pill and this is mellowing me out
[4:41:11] <%joodatious> its why most magic in skyrim is made to be used with spellswording
[4:41:12] <%dekkitout> @JayEarly The only saving grace was the necromage restoration perk improving all buffs as a vampire
[4:41:15] <otakon17> so far away, it's only six weeks
[4:41:19] <%TINMANxHMx> elden ring playthrough where pat and paige hand controller off on death lol
[4:41:20] <Brainhook> It feels weird to have a Dark Souls boss who is a dude with his face out.
[4:41:20] <otakon17> we'll be there in a SNAP
[4:41:20] <JayEarly> @joodatious but why is the melee combat so bad
[4:41:23] <+Shishi1205> his AI is so good
[4:41:24] <Brainhook> Not even a raisin.
[4:41:24] <otakon17> *summons wolf*
[4:41:25] <tolloponik> @storytayl0r its the des remake song but the theme actually fits the fight this time
[4:41:26] <Brainhook> Just a dude.
[4:41:28] <SubjectX07x> @storytayl0r It's the remake version of Maiden Astraea I believe.
[4:41:37] <%joodatious> @JayEarly shut up thats why
[4:41:39] <Jetsfantasy> I've been doing a SL1 run in my time to wait. Almost beaten Gwyn now
[4:41:46] <otakon17> Okay Regrowth only does SO much against the dot
[4:41:47] <%joodatious> its good and you love it
[4:41:54] <%cartakus> That snap though
[4:41:58] <%TINMANxHMx> that combo is so sick
[4:42:03] <storytayl0r> I wondered if it was the remake theme. Havent heard it much since I havent been able to play DEs Remake yet still.
[4:42:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this look sick
[4:42:14] <+GrampsGrubberfly> poison DOES stack. thats cool
[4:42:16] <+twohitgood> i think you might do better rolling forward into those magic darks instead of rolling to the side.
[4:42:17] <storytayl0r> THE TIMING WITH THE MUSOC
[4:42:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> this song is sick
[4:42:24] <otakon17> the thing is, Sekiro had a MUCH better moveset to handle this
[4:42:26] <%pectusumbra> I did watch, and doit does not drain while rolling, and it cancels on heal, yeah
[4:42:31] <%Stratiotai2> damn so close
[4:42:34] <otakon17> no stamina for one thing
[4:42:35] <el_patronn64> man flew
[4:42:35] <%Lizard0TM> custom
[4:42:35] <+Shishi1205> remake astrea
[4:42:36] <+trackles_64> Bangiing
[4:42:36] <%TINMANxHMx> idk but its sick
[4:42:38] <%Agami23> funfact, this guy doesent bleed much
[4:42:39] <BliVru> Maiden astrea
[4:42:40] <Minorou> sounds like a Maiden Astraea remix
[4:42:41] <tolloponik> @storytayl0r the remake songs miss the point so hard
[4:42:41] <+Aeogard> yeah i didnt like the maiden astrea remix in DeS but it works here so well
[4:42:41] <%hairtoday> it's rad
[4:42:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> I think it might be custom for this?
[4:42:43] <%cartakus> Need better weapon than dagger
[4:42:43] <%Daziggedey> This track sounds a bit like Maiden Astrea theme
[4:42:44] <%Stratiotai2> it was good what ever it is
[4:42:44] <otakon17> that slide kick is INSANE
[4:42:45] <%joodatious> remake astrea
[4:42:48] <storytayl0r> Maiden Astrae remake song
[4:42:49] <%TINMANxHMx> never heard it before that I can remember
[4:42:49] <Zombrocom> Des remake astrea
[4:42:50] <Yamchadassist> demon souls remake
[4:42:50] <SubjectX07x> I will never get tired of that finger snap it's so damn crisp
[4:42:51] <%Order_of_Mystery> it sounds like a DeS song
[4:42:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Is this original music?
[4:42:55] <SuperGoblinPunch> Sounds like Astrea
[4:42:56] <fimbulvetr27> Demons' Souls remake Maiden Astrea
[4:42:57] <%SaphronBlackbourne> DeS Remake Astrea
[4:42:57] <%shadowsofpain> That snap attack is the sickest fucking thing
[4:42:59] <BackflipCharm> It's the Archdruid fight music, obviously
[4:42:59] <otakon17> Maiden Astrea remake
[4:43:03] <+bluedude153> I will say sewer centipede can give this guy decent poison pretty quickly
[4:43:06] <SubjectX07x> It's Maiden Astraea from des @patstaresat
[4:43:07] <%TINMANxHMx> ahhhh
[4:43:15] <Ahack13> How Pat, hows the mod so far?
[4:43:17] <storytayl0r> Gotta have the harpischord
[4:43:22] <tolloponik> the remake songs suck but it fits here
[4:43:23] <Ekaelis> DeS remake ost fits suprisingly well huh?
[4:43:24] <%Puhff> Deez nuts
[4:43:27] <+trackles_64> Goood boi
[4:43:28] <%Agami23> yeah regrowth looks not great
[4:43:33] <%Daziggedey> Oh is that straight up the astrea theme ripped from the remake?
[4:43:33] <%TINMANxHMx> summon the mommy on him when you get to phase 2
[4:43:48] <vile_brand> does shooting him with poison give me dps or your buffed blade?
[4:43:52] <+trackles_64> this makes me wanna do a magic build
[4:43:53] <%joodatious> fuck buepoint for changing that song btw
[4:43:55] <+dcobra22322> Fundamentals of DS.... Die, horribly, Die Horendously LUL
[4:43:59] <%joodatious> what the hell where they thinking
[4:43:59] <vile_brand> more*
[4:44:04] <かわいい名前> nah regrowth is noticably good during that dot
[4:44:06] <otakon17> at least he's not immune to the Druid DoT
[4:44:14] <%Daziggedey> @joodatious Fuck them for a lot of that remake tbh
[4:44:17] <tolloponik> @joodatious we gotta make it EPIC
[4:44:17] <SubjectX07x> This guy is a pretty tough boss for his point in the game
[4:44:19] <SaltyAzteca> Snaps fingers to summon the good boi, so cool
[4:44:24] <$Jaxnos> i just got back from dinner is that a freaking re-skinned Owl?
[4:44:25] <+trackles_64> survived barely
[4:44:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i think emet has given me a pavlovian response to snaps
[4:44:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they're so cool
[4:44:39] <+Shishi1205> @Jaxnos + gundyr
[4:44:39] <otakon17> he's a transplant of an ENDGAME boss from Sekiro
[4:44:39] <%joodatious> @joodatious i mean the remake is really good overall
[4:44:43] <%joodatious> its just certain choices
[4:44:44] <nuane> @Jaxnos Forest Owl
[4:44:45] <%G_Thunders> This song sounds fantastic ya’ll are insane
[4:44:46] <%alphonseisbest> @cobalt_phoenix_ RIGHT
[4:44:47] <+Aeogard> @joodatious honestly i feel the same way about the DeS remake OST that I do with Nier Replicant's remake ost: "more instruments = better, right guys? :^)"
[4:44:53] <+trackles_64> Brok it
[4:44:54] <%TINMANxHMx> that was cool as shit
[4:44:55] <$Jaxnos> @Jaxnos jeeeeez
[4:44:56] <%alphonseisbest> only the coolest do magic with snaps
[4:44:57] <+the_drummaestro> that snap is so good
[4:45:06] <SaltyAzteca> He lands on his feet while you belly flop LUL
[4:45:09] <SuperGoblinPunch> That's fuckin cool
[4:45:12] <%cartakus> fundamentals?
[4:45:12] <+bluedude153> SAVE US SEWER CENTIPEDE
[4:45:20] <+trackles_64> the snap s like the niontendo switch commercials
[4:45:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> it'd be funny if he tried to snap and his fingers slipped LUL
[4:45:22] <otakon17> SUMMON THE GOOD BOIS
[4:45:22] <%Daziggedey> It's mostly stylistic changes I largely don't like from the remake, most of the OST for example
[4:45:24] <JayEarly> @G_Thunders it's a good track but  it works so much better here than in the remake
[4:45:25] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I will take the remake over OG any day
[4:45:28] <otakon17> and HEAL
[4:45:30] <%TINMANxHMx> DEPLOY THE MOMMY
[4:45:35] <+trackles_64> F
[4:45:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YO
[4:45:36] <otakon17> HEAL MAN!
[4:45:38] <+twohitgood> that was good
[4:45:39] <%Stratiotai2> holy shit
[4:45:41] <%TINMANxHMx> lmao
[4:45:42] <otakon17> phew
[4:45:42] <nuane> imagine all the movesets modders could steal if bloobourne were on PC...
[4:45:43] <+thephantompleb> thephantompleb subscribed with Prime. 
[4:45:43] <+GrampsGrubberfly> we should get a cool ass staff like him
[4:45:43] <+Cybercobra2> THE DISTRACTION
[4:45:45] <+kewlmyc> Are we really acting as if the DeS remake isn't overall pretty good? "Fuck Bluepoint" seems a bit harsh even if some of the minor changes aren't great.
[4:45:48] <+hailinpea> Love the Ganon scream
[4:45:50] <%TINMANxHMx> F
[4:45:50] <tanarath> :)
[4:45:50] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> good run!
[4:45:52] <+hailinpea> AAAAAHH
[4:45:53] <%joodatious> I feel like this boss should have a few more moments of downtime so casters can actually cast
[4:45:55] <SaltyAzteca> MIND GAMES
[4:45:56] <+Shishi1205> his Ai is so good
[4:45:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> this guy is so fucking rad
[4:46:00] <otakon17> that rush has WAY too much range
[4:46:01] <BliVru> @patstaresat put the staff on right hand and use shield maybe?
[4:46:03] <%cartakus> Ha!
[4:46:11] <%joodatious> he doesn't seem to have much stamina worry
[4:46:13] <+trackles_64> Who made this mod?
[4:46:16] <otakon17> Pat you forgot your summons
[4:46:18] <wakemeup244> Pat do be rocking shorts doe
[4:46:26] <otakon17> bosses NEVER have to worry about stamina
[4:46:27] <+Aeogard> this kinda stuff really makes these mods worth it
[4:46:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Do'No, huh?
[4:46:30] <+GrampsGrubberfly> someone with a fair bit of talent and time i imagine
[4:46:31] <otakon17> instead they have move "sets"
[4:46:35] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yo got this Pat!
[4:46:38] <%pectusumbra> honestly I'd say use your staff buff to start off?
[4:46:38] <storytayl0r> Some badasses made this mod
[4:46:39] <JayEarly> Bloodborne not being on pc hasn't stopped modders from using all the assets
[4:46:40] <+slaid_the_leather_man> Just tuned in that was cool shit
[4:46:41] <%dekkitout> If this mod is a solo project, hot damn
[4:46:41] <Treasure_Vault> Connie Vergence

[4:46:47] <Gabbycat> a lot of people i assume
[4:46:51] <nuane> Made by CouchJockey, TigerG92, AronTheBaron.
[4:46:54] <%Agami23> it was made by a group of people.
[4:46:59] <otakon17> a TON of people worked on this mod
[4:47:00] <SubjectX07x> Oh, this guys AI isn't aggressive, wait till you see the untended graves boss. LUL
[4:47:02] <otakon17> like a 20 person team
[4:47:03] <かわいい名前> team was 2 or 3 i believe
[4:47:05] <%joodatious> @otakon17 yeah they do. most bosses have moments where they slow down and give moments for the player to do stuff
[4:47:09] <%Monkeyweed21> whats the weirdest thing you've seen in this mod so far?
[4:47:09] <%Tman451> His DOT is fuckin nuts
[4:47:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> you're getting bodied, that's what
[4:47:14] <+twohitgood> were you rolling into it, mayeb?
[4:47:16] <+Aeogard> the first time is always the best run LUL
[4:47:17] <tanarath> You're getting clipped by poison.
[4:47:21] <%pectusumbra> you dodge them better when you just roll a lot

[4:47:31] <+GrampsGrubberfly> you were gittin gud
[4:47:31] <otakon17> you GOTTA heal when you get hit or you take like, 100 extra damage
[4:47:34] <+twohitgood> cause it looks like rolling into it would clear it.
[4:47:34] <storytayl0r> I can't explain why, but I love the snap into spirit wolf summon he does
[4:47:36] <+bcom33> YOu were rolling twice instead of sprinting out o the way
[4:47:36] <moonmintparadise> 100% of the time you dodged them every time
[4:47:37] <%Lizard0TM> side step the green
[4:47:37] <otakon17> and you ONLY have 666 HP
[4:47:41] <%bundle_of_herbs> dodging toward them more
[4:47:42] <BackflipCharm> You were doing the fundamentals
[4:47:45] <CrypticMochi> You were spamming dodges to the side I think
[4:47:47] <%pectusumbra> you seem to get clipped if you just walk, but when you do 2 rolls or so you get away clean every time
[4:47:47] <otakon17> you were strafing left or right
[4:47:51] <%hairtoday> you were sidestepping and then dodging into them to avoid the poison
[4:48:00] <otakon17> you were just strafing perpendicluar to the Drood
[4:48:08] <%pectusumbra> yeah! That's the big thing, dodge into all his stuff
[4:48:09] <tanarath> I think there's a sweet spot for range. Be father out, don't run till they start really moving towards you, etc.
[4:48:13] <nuane> try jumping over his attacks
[4:48:18] <skeletonman9000> cbcChoo cbcChoo cbcTrain
[4:48:22] <otakon17> ...
[4:48:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @otakon17 the fact that most bosses in the Souls series have hidden stamina bars that operate similiar to players is why Orphan of Kos is so bullshit, cuz Orphan has functionally infinite stamina
[4:48:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> love the hollow soldier fit
[4:48:28] <%Puhff> Just dont die duh
[4:48:29] <otakon17> nuane I will smack you
[4:48:37] <SaltyAzteca> the dart just whizzed
[4:48:46] <otakon17> honestly I'd summon at least ONE guy now and then another on the second phase
[4:48:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> if you get a clean run an casr ecentipede you got it in th3 bag
[4:48:55] <%baka_sugoi> W O O D
[4:49:04] <wakemeup244> Man this guy is fucking FOR REAL
[4:49:04] <otakon17> HEAL
[4:49:09] <%joodatious> jeez there is barely any opening to drink in that fight
[4:49:09] <%shurtal> Zangief is making his own toys, how industrious
[4:49:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Is this guy using Owl animations for his magic?
[4:49:13] <animaturgy> He is leveling crafting
[4:49:14] <%TINMANxHMx> summon the mommy for the poisons
[4:49:14] <scrumbotime> he is disassembling furniture
[4:49:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what is this moveset?, it's not just Gundyr
[4:49:15] <DianaTheAscian> how???
[4:49:16] <Profmcstevie> Father look, construction material
[4:49:16] <%dekkitout> Link the flame, Gief
[4:49:16] <+PrincessLuna85> zangeif of the first kiln
[4:49:17] <+Cybercobra2> hes off to kindle the first flame
[4:49:19] <%pectusumbra> honestly the best place to be might be up in his but. seems he only really melee's by shooting forward? just keep circling around his butt and sides?
[4:49:21] <%Nobrev> @otakon17 I think he only gets one per bonfire rest
[4:49:21] <%Dakuu75> maybe a piece of that Deer-bone
[4:49:23] <cgreene64> Did he pull off some of the floorboards lol
[4:49:25] <a_mad_dragon_> zangief destroyer of furniture
[4:49:26] <Ahack13> this boss is nuts
[4:49:27] <%bundle_of_herbs> zangief, unkindled ash
[4:49:28] <%cade_calrayn> @otakon17  the stream is on a 4-second delay, man
[4:49:30] <otakon17> yeah he does
[4:49:30] <%baka_sugoi> is gief a DRUID?
[4:49:32] <%Caped_Eggy> Zangief's gonna kindle the firdst flame
[4:49:33] <+Tucker0603> it's owl from sekiro
[4:49:33] <Gabbycat> LUL
[4:49:35] <%MidnightBurst12> hunting for candy
[4:49:36] <otakon17> but he has MULTIPLE different summons
[4:49:36] <%Pappajimbo> even inside dog will get stick
[4:49:41] <Sunstalker> Is it wood or just a brown glasses box?
[4:49:43] <+TheBitingIrish> Pulling out that ugly wood paneling
[4:49:46] <el_patronn64> LUL
[4:49:46] <+trackles_64> He showed it to father, job done
[4:49:47] <Profmcstevie> Zangief you're not a carpenter, enough
[4:49:51] <%cade_calrayn> he's looking upstairs to blame Paige
[4:49:54] <%hairtoday> zangief blames god
[4:49:55] <+bluedude153> wonder if its worth replacing essence strike with rat just to draw aggro
[4:49:58] <scrumbotime> GOD did it
[4:49:59] <tanarath> psaDogchamp HolidayLog
[4:50:11] <otakon17> God INSTRUCTED me to do it, Father-Zangief probably
[4:50:12] <%tpc28> Zangief the future carpenter hyzengOp
[4:50:13] <+trackles_64> Jesus did it
[4:50:18] <%Dakuu75> Woolie & Gief VS. God
[4:50:20] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp woolieVS GOD
[4:50:23] <Ahack13> Ember maybe for the extra hp?
[4:50:24] <%Monkeyweed21> ow wow yea those are totally just Owl's animations to a T
[4:50:25] <%joodatious> that dot against you lasts for so fucking long
[4:50:25] <%TINMANxHMx> love this mans hobo beard
[4:50:31] <otakon17> you got clipped
[4:50:38] <%joodatious> literally half ur life for nothing
[4:50:39] <%TINMANxHMx> oof
[4:50:41] <%VictoryStar926> VictoryStar926 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:50:43] <otakon17> and ONE projectile took off half your HP
[4:50:47] <Gabbycat> LUL
[4:50:53] <%epide> THE PATH OF THE DRUIDIC HOBO
[4:50:55] <+trackles_64> Are you under elveleed?
[4:50:57] <Anthrozzz> very tough boss
[4:50:58] <otakon17> it's the DOT, if you get hit with his magic you get DoT'd
[4:51:01] <otakon17> you GOTTA heal
[4:51:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hey, how's it goin?
[4:51:07] <$Jaxnos> sprinting to the side of that seemed to be the most effective
[4:51:07] <otakon17> he's definitely under leveled
[4:51:09] <tanarath> Going in for melee seems to be a poor choice
[4:51:12] <otakon17> he's got STARTING HP
[4:51:14] <DBLfinish> !mod
[4:51:15] <Anthrozzz> basically owl father from sekiro
[4:51:16] <otakon17> for a MAGE class
[4:51:17] <SaltyAzteca> I think you can do it, you got some good hits in
[4:51:17] <Sunstalker> This boss has horns growing out his head. Does that make him a furry? And as the arch druid, is he boss of Pat's furry druid?
[4:51:19] <%CatastropheCorvid> Rolling forward is the way to go for projectiles, as your frames will carry you past them if timed right.
[4:51:21] <nuane> I feel like using druid magic on him isn't the right play, its doing damage but I think literally any other magic would do more
[4:51:22] <%thephantompleb> running seems better than rolling
[4:51:28] <raknikmik> Run to the side? That seemed to work.
[4:51:30] <%TINMANxHMx> get good
[4:51:33] <Ahack13> any other paths tp take? Come back later?
[4:51:37] <otakon17> not offensively no, you got plenty of offense but you have no defense
[4:51:39] <krionik77> you need to level up health pat.
[4:51:43] <+GrampsGrubberfly> either pat has a godlike ability to ignore people in chat or he has certain people blocked
[4:51:44] <+Mrbaconator> oh glad yer having fun
[4:51:44] <+Cybercobra2> hes such a good boss, so nicely designed
[4:51:46] <%alphonseisbest> we get u

[4:56:05] <+MisterAvry> this is what happens when you don't bring Pasta
[4:56:05] <%GabeSweetMan> Shoulda gone with Pasta.
[4:56:05] <otakon17> it seems the magic still focuses on you tough
[4:56:08] <BackflipCharm> Think you need the hound for the speed
[4:56:09] <+MarkUriah> the centpede didnt even get a hit in
[4:56:11] <%dekkitout> The rock was more effectve
[4:56:14] <AoiRob> pat, doing a 2nd stream of this holding a +15 weapon and catalyst: "so i did some grinding off-stream"

[4:56:23] <BliVru> @patstaresat Try axe
[4:56:25] <moonmintparadise> dont rely too hard on casting
[4:56:26] <Zombrocom> Man, owl in dark souls combat engine makes for a hard boss
[4:56:40] <otakon17> DUDE you should equip armor with better MAGIC def
[4:56:43] <storytayl0r> Axe up, stupid
[4:56:43] <otakon17> like the DRUID stuff
[4:56:50] <%hax_metatron> @PatStaresAt The discord is better than the wiki

[4:56:55] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt Killing bosses gives you +6 onwards materials
[4:56:56] <%bundle_of_herbs> does the centipede get stronger if you buff before sumoning?
[4:57:01] <wakemeup244> @Zombrocom Yeah i'm super curious to see how sekiro gameplay carries over
[4:57:01] <+bluedude153> you kinda just need to go in with a friend.
[4:57:05] <tolloponik> I like the blood stain just being put at the door it's nice
[4:57:10] <otakon17> maybe it does
[4:57:13] <+theoldone001> He's got cool Poochie you got Mange poochie
[4:57:14] <%Deft_Thought> Can you parry any of this dudes shit?
[4:57:16] <+trackles_64> is this what eldens ring gonna be like?
[4:57:17] <+AlucardX60> You get most of your materials from your covenant. The rest you have to trade for at your vendor.
[4:57:17] <%dekkitout> Zoomie dog doing way better
[4:57:17] <otakon17> I'm almost certain the summons scale on your stats

[4:58:00] <+Shishi1205> that lizard does a ton of poise dmg
[4:58:00] <+trackles_64> Break the floor like a boss
[4:58:05] <+Sneaky_Catfish> with the homing thing, wait, then dodge forward and to the left. That's what you did the first time.
[4:58:05] <otakon17> HEAL!

[4:58:29] <DianaTheAscian> the reads
[4:58:29] <%GabeSweetMan> He's so cool!
[4:58:30] <%tank7013> Looks like the wolf hitting you causes dot too
[4:58:30] <%DEETRz> damn that emet snap
[4:58:34] <tanarath> He's doing combos, nice
[4:58:37] <%IamGrapes> that snap gives me Emet vibes
[4:58:38] <storytayl0r> Damn, the fucking coordination
[4:58:38] <%Monkeyweed21> this seems absurdly hard for this stage of the game
[4:58:39] <%MichaelDood> Pokemanz combo
[4:58:39] <BackflipCharm> I like when the lizard fell
[4:58:40] <yyyyfdugyu> i watched a stream where they farmed a lot of covenant material in the cathedral of the deep where the zombie bit leeches always respawn
[4:58:42] <+Shishi1205> yeah dot is dot
[4:58:45] <Afterman_> mmm the snap
[4:58:45] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Damn this is a sick boss fight!
[4:58:47] <+MarkUriah> Dark Souls 3 Convergence mod
[4:58:47] <+Shishi1205> wolf I mean
[4:58:47] <+Pars_Librum> I'm going to have to try this mod
[4:58:48] <otakon17> ANY of his magic causes the dot
[4:58:49] <%GabeSweetMan> That stinger is so nuts. I can't believe how far it goes.
[4:58:50] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt i think you just trade covenant mats at the druid guy and the tree
[4:58:51] <%hewlettfan96> So fucking ccccoool
[4:58:52] <What_Up_Duck> The snap's from Lady Butterfly, yeah?
[4:58:53] <+muetank> Read like a BOOK
[4:58:54] <%thephantompleb> rock lizard is best boy
[4:58:58] <+GrampsGrubberfly> okay dont beat the boss this try i gotta get some coffee
[4:59:01] <otakon17> and the dot basically DOUBLES the amount of damage you take
[4:59:01] <+theoldone001> I want Elden Ring just because of this, seeing new cool shit is awesome
[4:59:07] <SubjectX07x> If you run up to him and plunging attack during the fall it does good damage
[4:59:07] <+Shishi1205> the easiest covenant farm is the deachons of the deep
[4:59:14] <otakon17> I'm pretty certain it's MAGIC damage so you should equip someting that PROTECT AGAINST MAGIC
[4:59:16] <+Eiiriika> wow this guy is too cool
[4:59:19] <otakon17> LIKE THE DRUID CLOTHES
[4:59:19] <storytayl0r> This guy would drive me up the wall to fight myself, but he's REAL COOL.
[4:59:23] <%pectusumbra> I do think the answer is actually to stay hard on him. He's just so mobile otherwise
[4:59:31] <+twdlrr> Man Gundyr with the Aldrich blast is so rad
[4:59:38] <%SuperFineButtHairs> puppy fight
[4:59:39] <%Monkeyweed21> man I should go back to Sekiro and do that challenge shit they added
[4:59:43] <AoiRob> oh yea that axe does bleed
[4:59:44] <ChineseNininga> getting close works much better for this boss
[4:59:46] <%IamGrapes> i should check out this mod again with the updates
[4:59:46] <%cartakus> go gief!
[4:59:53] <%cartakus> oh
[4:59:55] <otakon17> like it' the magic that's doing the majority of damage against you
[5:00:04] <Yamchadassist> hound and hatchet PogChamp
[5:00:08] <+Shishi1205> hey the axe works
[5:00:10] <AoiRob> should put some titanite into it if you're gonna switch weapons
[5:00:10] <otakon17> because even a single NICK is shaving off half your health
[5:00:14] <Yamchadassist> oo
[5:00:15] <SaltyAzteca> CAUGHT YA HEELIN
[5:00:17] <+Shishi1205> he is resistant to your dagger

[5:00:37] <%thephantompleb> you can do it believe in yourself

[5:04:14] <+Cybercobra2> @joodatious absolutely
[5:04:15] <raknikmik> New boss for the mod uses Owls moves from sekiro
[5:04:23] <+hush_wolf> Is that Rex on your shirt btw?
[5:04:27] <%Deft_Thought> Remind yourself that overconfidence blah blah
[5:04:28] <%epide> mabey use the stone lizard to act as a lure
[5:04:29] <%joodatious> PogChamp
[5:04:31] <%SuperFineButtHairs> is this a full conversion mod or does it just add new areas and new classes?
[5:04:31] <+Shishi1205> I beat his ass with low Vit too
[5:04:33] <+Joe2187> did the game always look this nice looking?
[5:04:34] <+Shishi1205> Its posible
[5:04:43] <%IamGrapes> im going to guess and say that you can't multiplayer with this mod, right?
[5:04:58] <+hush_wolf> it looks very different
[5:04:59] <+Shishi1205> @IamGrapes you can but you get banned
[5:05:04] <%joodatious> DS3 is a pretty good looker tho
[5:05:04] <+Cybercobra2> @SuperFineButtHairs kinda inbetween, it adds a LOT but its still DS3 at the core
[5:05:08] <Profmcstevie> Good lighting is an eternal battle
[5:05:11] <%IamGrapes> bummer
[5:05:16] <%joodatious> especially its cobblestone stuff
[5:05:22] <%SuperFineButtHairs> @Cybercobra2 dope
[5:05:25] <+Cybercobra2> @SuperFineButtHairs but effectivly its a full conversion
[5:05:25] <+MisterAvry> No! No Greengief!
[5:05:29] <%thephantompleb> rolled right into a stinger
[5:05:36] <%joodatious> lighting changes everything
[5:05:36] <+Joe2187> what is this green magic?
[5:05:41] <+Shishi1205> he is a setup kinda boss
[5:05:46] <moonmintparadise> that combo is vicious
[5:05:46] <kieranmusic> Every time. Can't get over how good this remix is.
[5:05:50] <+Cybercobra2> @Joe2187 druid magic
[5:05:52] <%joodatious> the best textures look can look awful with bad lighting
[5:06:04] <+hush_wolf> woof, that kick
[5:06:05] <%IamGrapes> i wonder who they based this boss off of
[5:06:06] <%cartakus> Is there a place I can read about the new content?
[5:06:14] <+twohitgood> i swear that kick looks like the animation from sekiro.
[5:06:15] <%bluetocho13> is this a new song too?
[5:06:16] <+Shishi1205> Hey dot doesnt proc while you are on the ground
[5:06:16] <%G_Thunders> Those green orbs are just the butterflies from Sekiro right?
[5:06:16] <%joodatious> @kieranmusic its awful in the context it was made for sadly
[5:06:17] <+MisterAvry> that's one disrespectful kick
[5:06:18] <%GabeSweetMan> He's basically Gundyr the Owl.
[5:06:22] <vile_brand> oh your health doesnt drop when knocked down i dont think
[5:06:24] <%MidnightBurst12> that boot has some weight to it

[5:18:52] <+UltraViolet371> basically he's a 6.0 SMN and you're a 2.0 SMN
[5:18:55] <+kewlmyc> Damn, you're just fucked if he hits you with that
[5:18:56] <SaltyAzteca> You have the strat @PatStaresAt
[5:18:59] <kieranmusic> Yo! That's a win!
[5:19:00] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Nailed it
[5:19:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> YO DID THAT SAY DEMONBRANDT?!
[5:19:01] <%KnifeyMcEdge> mmmhmmmm
[5:19:06] <+Shishi1205> Ember for the extra life?
[5:19:06] <+MisterAvry> that's a 50 DKP minus, Gief
[5:19:07] <@DakotaMacDoodle> In the bag
[5:19:15] <+polothegreatest> Ultraaaaa
[5:19:17] <+osgoode> boss rage compilation?
[5:19:19] <otakon17> like if the damage had carried over from the first time you did like 5K damage to him before the phase change he wouldhave only had like 2K HP left
[5:19:39] <Zombrocom> Well, it IS a sekiro boss
[5:19:48] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Nothing but net!
[5:19:51] <otakon17> he's not raging he's enjoying the challenge
[5:19:51] <illtima> So wait does this boss just straight up replace Curserotten wood?
[5:19:51] <+osgoode> looks really fun honestly
[5:19:53] <+Thyzoon> Not much to rage at though, this boss is genuinely badass
[5:19:53] <+liquidzr0> yeah. owl is pretty cool
[5:19:56] <otakon17> bc he IS from Seikro XD
[5:20:04] <+theoldone001> OMG you can start with the Lightning Arrow. Best mod ever already.
[5:20:08] <%RedSqurrl> RedSqurrl subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Always love your content Pat. Always a good way to wind down the day! <3 You excited for Elden Ring? My BF is super stoked for it, but I have no idea what it's about.
[5:20:09] <%hewlettfan96> This boss is so cool and hard
[5:20:15] <otakon17> now when do you fight... LADY BUTTERFLY?
[5:20:20] <%ZephynM> Sekiro is my favorite of their games so far. psaWink
[5:20:26] <+Shishi1205> the wolf is lost lmao
[5:20:26] <otakon17> HEAL
[5:20:27] <%Rathalos2006> Convergence vs Cinders, which is the better mod?
[5:20:30] <%hewlettfan96> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[5:20:39] <+Shishi1205> conver easy
[5:20:42] <+osgoode> this makes me want a pc
[5:20:47] <Dova573> wait is that OWL?
[5:20:49] <otakon17> Convergence seems to be really good
[5:20:49] <kieranmusic> Big
[5:20:50] <boostergoldz> probably convergence
[5:20:51] <@DakotaMacDoodle> swoosh
[5:20:52] <%dekkitout> Rocco's.... rocco's not doing hot
[5:20:53] <+theoldone001> Been a while since I've seen you get your shit kicked in this quick lol
[5:20:59] <+Pars_Librum> Having only played cinders, this looks a bit more interesting
[5:20:59] <otakon17> you need more health and defense
[5:21:00] <+GrampsGrubberfly> you were just off rhythm. its fine. next one for sure
[5:21:00] <%Cozy90> IM PROUD OF YOU NO MATTER WHAT PAT
[5:21:02] <%joodatious> @Dova573 yes
[5:21:16] <otakon17> you need MAGIC defense becaue that's what you're taking the majority of the damage from
[5:21:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat summon the blue eyes white dragon
[5:21:20] <Yamchadassist> convergnce is like a almost new game while cinders is super ds 3 turbo hd remix
[5:21:21] <%bundle_of_herbs> can you get on the stairs when the floor collapses and stay at the top to cheese him?
[5:21:22] <otakon17> swap to your Druid stuff
[5:21:22] <%hewlettfan96> Guts never eat as much as I did tonight your body will punish you
[5:21:22] <RevenantJoy> Believe in the me that believes in you, Pat.
[5:21:42] <+GrampsGrubberfly> *pat intentionally doesnt level health or defense for the entirety of the run out of spite*
[5:21:45] <BackflipCharm> You need less health and defense. The only way to learn is to die more
[5:21:46] <+crimsonomen0> you should hit him without getting hit yourself
[5:21:48] <%Rathalos2006> Alright, I just got home after a night of drinking, but I'm gonna grab Convergence tomorrow and check it out. Assuming my hangover doesn't kill me :p
[5:21:50] <SaltyAzteca> ROCK BOY NOO
[5:22:00] <$SGrim> Brick! NO!!
[5:22:02] <+osgoode> centipede seems way better than lizard
[5:22:09] <Profmcstevie> If you reroll your stats to have 1HP, you will succeed out of fear
[5:22:09] <otakon17> and Bricks down
[5:22:13] <%Deft_Thought> Centipede being tanky is pretty useful at this point
[5:22:15] <Yamchadassist> rockyyyyy BibleThump
[5:22:21] <otakon17> BUT you only need to do like 1400 more damage for phase 2
[5:22:26] <otakon17> you can do it
[5:22:31] <%G_Thunders> Oh no, Pat’s having trouble on a cool boss fight. Quick tell him how to finish it as quickly as possible!
[5:22:37] <mattymcfilth> drop your shield
[5:22:43] <otakon17> JUST A BIT MORE DAMAGE
[5:22:47] <otakon17> he has no shield
[5:22:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Boot to the head
[5:22:58] <otakon17> THE WOLF CAN'T HIT AT CLOSE RANGE
[5:22:59] <$SGrim> The rock lizard is most useful for a melee focused build, because he sticks right up next to you unless he's attacking an enemy at distance.
[5:23:01] <$milhousego> THIS MUSIC THO
[5:23:22] <%Cozy90> the start of this song always reminds me of that one song from interstellar
[5:23:24] <%ZephynM> Yeah, now that I ignore the baldness with horns, I can see it is Owl.
[5:23:25] <SaltyAzteca> WHAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[5:23:26] <+Pachi3000> RUDE
[5:23:28] <%GabeSweetMan> DUDE CALM DOWN
[5:23:29] <%cvp5127> LUL
[5:23:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> B R U H
[5:23:32] <SaltyAzteca> MY DUDE
[5:23:33] <DianaTheAscian> bull
[5:23:34] <+TheBitingIrish> That's bogus
[5:23:34] <otakon17> he should be phase changing soon
[5:23:35] <+tempestzephyr> Well excuse him
[5:23:38] <%Deft_Thought> Get Woolie to tell Reggie this is vanilla DS3 woolieF
[5:23:38] <+liquidzr0> getloMUDAMUDA
[5:23:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[5:23:39] <+Cybercobra2> Dude did a awareness check on ya
[5:23:41] <%SpontaneousC> That stun was a little bull
[5:23:42] <%GabeSweetMan> That he's ON YOU the moment he touches down is legit kinda unfair.
[5:23:45] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Whaa
[5:23:46] <%Idziman> Idziman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 56 months! 
[5:23:49] <otakon17> he was taking damage from the Dot
[5:23:49] <SaltyAzteca> This boss has no chill my work
[5:23:49] <%Cozy90> :O
[5:23:51] <kieranmusic> Here Pat. I can give it a try for you if you want?
[5:23:51] <%SaiyanShoto> LUL LUL
[5:23:52] <Profmcstevie> One extra large BRUH please
[5:23:54] <SaltyAzteca> word even
[5:23:54] <otakon17> and that's what screwed him over
[5:23:58] <+Aeogard> that one is really unfair LMAO
[5:23:58] <+Jessie_Lockhart> That seemed pretty cheap
[5:24:00] <xerotwo> OOP AHH! LUL
[5:24:00] <mattymcfilth> just drop your sheild
[5:24:07] <wichothemisticalwizard> Pat unlocked easy mode
[5:24:09] <otakon17> the MAGIC DOT that could probably be REDUCED by UPPING HIS MAGIC DEFENSE by EQUIPPING HIS DRUID GEAR
[5:24:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Profmcstevie With extra reverb
[5:24:10] <+muetank> mash roll while falling so you can move after you land faster
[5:24:11] <+GrampsGrubberfly> the effectiveness of the summons seems a little rng based.
[5:24:12] <BackflipCharm> What if you lamed it out and went with a shield and staff setup?
[5:24:12] <fojidoj> Bruh moment
[5:24:21] <+osgoode> lol didn't even have a chance once you landed there jeez
[5:24:22] <%SaiyanShoto> Paige gonna come in and first try the boss
[5:24:31] <otakon17> he doesn't have the stats to use a shield right now
[5:24:35] <+Pachi3000> he's doing the thing
[5:24:45] <+Pachi3000> Kappa
[5:24:48] <%cartakus> Druid mode
[5:24:48] <+Cybercobra2> that seems important
[5:24:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[5:24:50] <SaltyAzteca> Kappa
[5:24:56] <%cartakus> Sure jem
[5:25:01] <BackflipCharm> Wow Pat great thinking
[5:25:02] <+TheBitingIrish> Awooo OhMyDog
[5:25:05] <%dekkitout> Pat was playing with the training weights on(?)
[5:25:11] <otakon17> Good on you Pat
[5:25:18] <+GrampsGrubberfly> really glad pat figured that out on his own
[5:25:20] <Mirrorcatch> you're so smart and cool Pat
[5:25:22] <Yamchadassist> centipede sucks at grabbing aggro tho
[5:25:35] <%cartakus> go weird spider thing
[5:25:44] <+crimsonomen0> sp played a druid and are trying to fight the ARCHdruid?
[5:26:01] <otakon17> OKAY he should be getting ready to phase change
[5:26:02] <%cartakus> You still have shit for health so
[5:26:05] <+osgoode> LOOOL
[5:26:07] <%TINMANxHMx> I wonder if his spell ignores magic defense
[5:26:12] <BackflipCharm> Wow Pat looks like your idea wasn't so good after all
[5:26:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Finally he gives you a breather when landing.
[5:26:17] <%codedoomboy> Try staying close to the boss so the summons Ai Doesn't go dumb
[5:26:26] <+osgoode> WHAT IS THAT MOVE LOL
[5:26:27] <otakon17> OOOH that was close
[5:26:28] <+GrampsGrubberfly> what if you needed nature defense instead Kappa
[5:26:34] <%dekkitout> Rocco's gonna have to pull the shit out of the aggro
[5:26:36] <%alphonseisbest> see this boss seem like a good TEST OF YOUR REFELXES
[5:26:38] <SaltyAzteca> THE ROCK BOY TOOK THE HIT
[5:26:41] <%Nobrev> we take those
[5:26:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> Use the power of JANK
[5:26:43] <+Cybercobra2> rock lizard with the TANK
[5:26:45] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt it hit the lizard
[5:26:46] <+GrampsGrubberfly> rocko took aggro for you FeelsGoodMan
[5:26:48] <Yamchadassist> yooo rocky got you bro SwiftRage
[5:26:49] <%cartakus> oof
[5:26:50] <%dekkitout> Rip rRocco
[5:26:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> ROCK LOBSTER NOOOOO
[5:26:59] <+twohitgood> looks like he can cancel out of any magic into that dash so i'd guess any casting from him isn't safe.
[5:27:00] <otakon17> the extra magic defense DOES help because getting clipped by one of those bullets did WAY more damage before
[5:27:02] <%TINMANxHMx> damn
[5:27:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Bruh
[5:27:06] <+crimsonomen0> If you beat him are you the archdruid?
[5:27:09] <otakon17> doggo dead already damn
[5:27:14] <%cartakus> Full on melee with summons?
[5:27:15] <%Axellogic> Still fighting this guy I see
[5:27:24] <+Cybercobra2> that seems like a reasonable assumption
[5:27:26] <Yamchadassist> my heart cant handle watching this rock die bro
[5:27:26] <otakon17> yeah he's a toughie
[5:27:28] <+osgoode> prioritize heals over casts
[5:27:31] <hannesking08> SeemsGood Nice mod
[5:27:37] <+GrampsGrubberfly> murder is the only way to ascend the druid ranks.
[5:27:38] <SaltyAzteca> This is givin me some Master Asia vibes
[5:27:38] <fojidoj> The worst part of this is that you were so close so you know it’s doable
[5:27:39] <moonmintparadise> what about the stamina herbs ?
[5:27:42] <+hush_wolf> no if you beat him you are Big Archdruid
[5:27:44] <+GrampsGrubberfly> i wonder why there arent many druids left
[5:27:45] <+osgoode> how many heals do you have? can't see
[5:27:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> You really were the Dark Souls 3: Convergence this whole time
[5:27:47] <otakon17> you are the new Archdruidupon supping is succulent soul
[5:27:52] <moonmintparadise> he might not get into the fog gate with you
[5:27:54] <kieranmusic> Prioritize beating him instead of not.
[5:27:59] <otakon17> he has 4 I think?
[5:28:03] <+Shishi1205> bro the counter parts you fight are really tough
[5:28:09] <otakon17> plsu the Regrowth spell
[5:28:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat got a Dooooog now?
[5:28:13] <otakon17> oh six nice

[5:28:16] <%bundle_of_herbs> you also got health potions from emma
[5:28:18] <+osgoode> can u allot Estes for magic?
[5:28:19] <otakon17> yeah I can't see either
[5:28:19] <+twohitgood> @osgoode it's not really a matter of prioritizing one over the other. he needs to do it when it's safe.
[5:28:24] <+crimsonomen0> also i sweat that boss music sounds very Duel of the Fates'y at times.
[5:28:27] <%joodatious> prioritize winning instead of losing this time pat
[5:28:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> bodied
[5:28:34] <%cartakus> Later?
[5:28:35] <+crimsonomen0> *swear
[5:28:35] <otakon17> dman look at that dot go
[5:28:41] <+GrampsGrubberfly> @osgoode it looks like FP auto regens in this mod
[5:28:42] <otakon17> DAMMIT
[5:28:47] <mattymcfilth> oooooo
[5:28:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[5:28:52] <+osgoode> is there maybe another route you can go for a little?
[5:28:52] <BioStormX> The key to this boss is to hurt him more and also get hurt by him less
[5:28:54] <SaltyAzteca> SCHow rude
[5:28:56] <Berendenn> Just make his health 0 without letting yours go to 0
[5:28:56] <+RJay80> i see what pat is saying about the head of the model. Looks weird as hell
[5:28:57] <%Insom62> Insom62 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! I will give you 100 dollars to get Tim Rogers on the podcast
[5:29:02] <Yamchadassist> woah

[5:29:05] <%cartakus> fuck
[5:29:08] <BackflipCharm> You know Pat if you had armor with higher physical defense his rush down wouldn't hurt as much
[5:29:12] <+Thyzoon> POISE
[5:29:19] <+Cybercobra2> poise boi attack
[5:29:21] <AoiRob> it looks like perseverance
[5:29:24] <BliVru> Ember?
[5:29:31] <otakon17> the rush down isn't really what's killing him
[5:29:33] <+Shishi1205> he has almost no armor to pick from guus
[5:29:33] <+Aeogard> hey pat you know if you farmed for souls for 15 hours to level up this would be easier right
[5:29:43] <+GrampsGrubberfly> you just have to have a bigger dick than the boss. then we win ]
[5:29:45] <otakon17> it's getting clipped by the magic and the dot that sets him up for the rush down kill
[5:29:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[5:29:47] <Yamchadassist> squishy druid man
[5:29:47] <+Thyzoon> Nono I'm not saying you need poise I was saying that attack gives poise
[5:29:52] <+Pachi3000> Elmo disliked this plan
[5:29:55] <CuttleCrow> thats what next week is for
[5:29:56] <illtima> Just don't get hit ever Pat, jeez
[5:29:58] <SaltyAzteca> @Aeogard BUT THE PEDIGREE
[5:30:00] <Burdenslo> would that other spell nullify the dot? renewal
[5:30:04] <otakon17> ROCCO'S MODERN LIZARD!
[5:30:10] <kieranmusic> You know if you levelled up strength. You'll do more damage.
[5:30:10] <+Shishi1205> damn rocko got fucked
[5:30:11] <otakon17> it doesn't sadly
[5:30:13] <otakon17> it SLOWS the DoT
[5:30:17] <%Rathalos2006> Just go back to the starting area and grind, Minh style
[5:30:19] <+Aeogard> @SaltyAzteca pedigree? i never got my first degree!
[5:30:21] <otakon17> Rocco no!
[5:30:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat I am so high I believe you'll do it in one
[5:30:32] <%joodatious> pfft that lizard is so trash most of the time
[5:30:35] <%baka_sugoi> ROCCO USE ROLLOUT
[5:30:36] <moonmintparadise> oh this is a good start
[5:30:37] <+GrampsGrubberfly> rocko is doing his best

[5:31:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Rock buddy oh no lol
[5:31:03] <%dekkitout> Get em bork
[5:31:05] <otakon17> okay PHASE change coming up!
[5:31:10] <$SGrim> RIP Rocco
[5:31:11] <+Big_Bossuru> I believe
[5:31:14] <+GrampsGrubberfly> FeelsBadMan
[5:31:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> Gottem
[5:31:14] <+Aeogard> unsafe smh
[5:31:17] <%joodatious> its fucked that he charges you before you even get up
[5:31:17] <+crimsonomen0> have you considered equipping heavy armor and a greatsword  and being a different class?
[5:31:17] <$SGrim> RIP Patto
[5:31:17] <+Cybercobra2> unfortunate
[5:31:19] <SaltyAzteca> @Aeogard Keepo you, stahp
[5:31:21] <%waltzqueen> You feel it don't you !
[5:31:23] <otakon17> summon BORK!
[5:31:28] <otakon17> GODDAMMIT
[5:31:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HE KILLEX ROCCO.
[5:31:30] <%dekkitout> Only good time is what- his double backflip?
[5:31:30] <xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[5:31:30] <BackflipCharm> Wow dead in two swings
[5:31:31] <%Cozy90> his recovery time on that fall is absurd
[5:31:32] <+bluedude153> Pat I didnt beat this fight till post undead legion
[5:31:34] <+Reise04> we're gonna be here till you're able to perfect him
[5:31:35] <SaltyAzteca> @crimsonomen0 against magic?
[5:31:36] <otakon17> his melee two shots him regardless
[5:31:39] <kieranmusic> Just make fun of him so he gets embarrassed and runs away.
[5:31:40] <+RJay80> just watch rocco fall back first into phase 2 and dying is kinda funny
[5:31:41] <AoiRob> i think the ground crystal attack is the best time
[5:31:42] <moonmintparadise> yeah whats a good move you can time stuff on? I guess the homing missles ?
[5:31:44] <+Shishi1205> @patstaresat some of the other covenants give you faster cast speed maybe try that?
[5:31:45] <otakon17> it does over 300 damage a swing
[5:31:47] <+bluedude153> I believe u
[5:31:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[5:31:50] <%joodatious> press X to doubt
[5:31:52] <%G_Thunders> What school of magic counters Druid in this? Ice?
[5:31:52] <otakon17> he's only got 666 HP
[5:31:56] <%cartakus> I mean why not?
[5:31:57] <+Aeogard> cmon pat why wont you take all of our conflicting advice
[5:31:59] <%Agami23> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[5:31:59] <hannesking08> how many more Bosses are in this mod?
[5:32:03] <BackflipCharm> Yeah definitely needs more physical defense
[5:32:06] <+GrampsGrubberfly> gottem
[5:32:07] <+Cybercobra2> @moonmintparadise when hes summoning crystals seems like a decent gap in pressure to do so
[5:32:09] <Treasure_Vault> Boss face bashing is timeless, keep it up.
[5:32:11] <%alphonseisbest> A TEST OF YOUR REFEXES PAT
[5:32:12] <+crimsonomen0> win
[5:32:16] <+twohitgood> @otakon17 that's fine. SL1 runs work like this and he's got good enough damage.
[5:32:20] <aGuyFromPleven> waaait a minute... this is a mod yes?
[5:32:26] <@Lion_kun> I have to think he's an optional mid to lategame boss, he does way too much damage.
[5:32:31] <+Aeogard> @alphonseisbest THE POWER TO TRANSCEND
[5:32:36] <otakon17> yeah I don't think you can do an SL1 in this MODDED version
[5:32:36] <+twohitgood> he just needs to find those opening and quit trying to force openings.
[5:32:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> F
[5:32:39] <SaltyAzteca> ROCKY NOOO
[5:32:39] <+GrampsGrubberfly> NO ROCKKO
[5:32:41] <+Cybercobra2> DAMN did you see that flamebreath damage
[5:32:44] <+Shishi1205> he is the druid boss
[5:32:49] <%dekkitout> Rocco was the fall guy we needed all along
[5:32:49] <%alphonseisbest> @Aeogard HIS FOR THE TAKING
[5:32:57] <otakon17> OKAY phase change COMING
[5:33:06] <%joodatious> @twohitgood bro there are no openings
[5:33:06] <+crimsonomen0> that man did a backflip, you have no chance
[5:33:10] <otakon17> GOOD HUSTLE PAT
[5:33:17] <%ZephynM> Too bad we can't just mikiri counter his thrust attack.
[5:33:17] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[5:33:18] <otakon17> ONE heal for the first phase, you can do it!
[5:33:21] <%SharkMissile> Dog really let us down
[5:33:29] <%cartakus> Off screen death for gief
[5:33:35] <$milhousego> is this the first time Pat is playing this mod?

[5:59:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @cartakus getting rushed down seems very easy in this game tbf
[5:59:16] <otakon17> yeah you haven't explored the tower
[5:59:17] <Mirrorcatch> the one you jump to from flynn's ring
[5:59:17] <moonmintparadise> wont that skip breaks Siegwards quest or is it gone because the demon is not there?

[6:02:23] <marvel877> had dinner and did dishes, what I miss?
[6:02:45] <AoiRob> unique weapons cannot be infused i think
[6:02:46] <otakon17> Pat beat the druid
[6:02:57] <%Maids4lyfe> pat killed a druid and now he big druid @marvel877
[6:03:05] <$chance_h> Tree guy kicked pats butt with cool dog combo
[6:03:07] <@Ranryu692> too much effort for Flynn's ring
[6:03:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i really wanna try this now
[6:03:23] <+crimsonomen0> everyone things magic is so cool until they get punched in the face
[6:03:23] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[6:03:35] <+crimsonomen0> *thinks
[6:03:35] <otakon17> it hits you regardless of dodge
[6:03:49] <%joodatious> it seems kinda shit
[6:03:53] <%joodatious> very slow
[6:03:54] <%RealThiele> cast time is too long
[6:03:57] <%cartakus> It has probpems tracking
[6:04:00] <+bassforte123> It looks like their dots stack though
[6:04:05] <otakon17> the helmet is good
[6:04:06] <+Shishi1205> it's good on open spaces
[6:04:08] <CuttleCrow> I had the same issue in cinders with the dark magic sword being just too good
[6:04:10] <%dekkitout> Not enough projectiles for how slow it is
[6:04:11] <%pectusumbra> probably better on larger slow enemies where it can hit all the spores
[6:04:19] <Profmcstevie> If it can be improved in anyway like the DOT damage increase? I could fucks with it
[6:04:23] <+Shishi1205> more dps anyway
[6:04:41] <%joodatious> yeah the basic missle does way more
[6:04:43] <%joodatious> and faster
[6:04:44] <otakon17> man lookit dat dot
[6:04:55] <%joodatious> strike is way better by a massive degree
[6:05:03] <otakon17> yeah because each bullet ups the DoT damage
[6:05:04] <CuttleCrow> does the swarm heal you at all?
[6:05:08] <kinkade_77> is this as good as embers
[6:05:09] <+Cybercobra2> i wonder if there is some trick to it, like does it lifeleech?
[6:05:10] <%Agami23> it would be better if it was more orbs
[6:05:10] <tolloponik> the dot doesn't seem to stack with wisp
[6:05:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Strik's DOT seems to stack, while Wisp's DOT doesn't?
[6:05:22] <+tempestzephyr> it's also not good in tight quarters, since it just hits walls
[6:05:27] <%joodatious> whisp seems like a spell made for MP but its still way too slow for that
[6:05:28] <otakon17> WIsps dot stacks too
[6:05:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> just jump Kappa
[6:05:31] <otakon17> you could try falling
[6:05:33] <%pectusumbra> does it mention anything in the spells description?
[6:05:33] <+Shishi1205> walk there
[6:05:39] <%capnshupe> i could see mist doing better if it upped dot per projectile instead of the once it looks like its doing
[6:05:39] <+Shishi1205> it's open
[6:05:48] <CuttleCrow> the door with the blind lady may be open
[6:05:51] <%Agami23> you do have fall control potions
[6:06:08] <%dekkitout> It says drains health- does that mean life steal is a different question
[6:06:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> maybe... unless?
[6:06:12] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt the door in the rat sewer
[6:06:13] <%cartakus> the door with popopoka
[6:06:17] <%joodatious> @capnshupe i think it does do that but strike is way higher for both direct damage and dot
[6:06:26] <+dasmause> he has a red name pat
[6:06:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> rud
[6:06:26] <$chance_h> One does not simply walk to Mordo
[6:06:27] <+Shishi1205> lmao
[6:06:30] <otakon17> dude his name is in RED what did you expect?! XD

[6:07:09] <moonmintparadise> yeah she is already at firelink
[6:07:11] <%capnshupe> @capnshupe that's v fair, i wonder what their real vision with the spell was then
[6:07:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Rats... we're the rats...
[6:07:16] <%joodatious> fuck that rat

[6:23:13] <AoiRob> now THIS is the quality content we needed all stream
[6:23:20] <%emperordread> It's the teeth hangin out
[6:23:20] <DBLfinish> I got a tan and white on
[6:23:25] <%walternatorz> he looks like a goblin's pet
[6:23:26] <%joodatious> he ugly
[6:23:27] <%Order_of_Mystery> hes a boglin
[6:23:27] <%Axellogic> Wouldnt that be a miniture ORC
[6:23:29] <DBLfinish> Not nearly as good lookin tho
[6:23:29] <$Artoo__The_Me> Yes
[6:23:30] <%dekkitout> Looks more like a bear
[6:23:31] <%baka_sugoi> Goblin Child
[6:23:32] <moonmintparadise> he is so cute
[6:23:34] <%Zundelle> furred goblin
[6:23:34] <JehutyVer2> goblins are real
[6:23:35] <+SaltySeaSam> mind goblin personified
[6:23:35] <%Agami23> do goblins live underground?
[6:23:37] <%greasypete00> he looks like a goblin or maybe a little orc of some sort
[6:23:37] <scrumbotime> if you could get him to stand on two legs and gave him a little knife, boom, goblin
[6:23:38] <%CalderGaming> doglin
[6:23:40] <%Agami23> i thought that was gnomes
[6:23:42] <Profmcstevie> he would love to dwell under a bridge
[6:23:42] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaDogchamp
[6:23:44] <+AlucardX60> He is a goblin's pet.
[6:23:47] <hearingthenseeing> gobbling these NUTS
[6:23:47] <+MisterAvry> he's a burgergoblin
[6:23:51] <thebestesttrashpanda> Dogs with that face all look like goblins lol, my brother in law has a boston terrier thats also a goblin
[6:23:52] <AoiRob> gief looks like he rests underneath rocks
[6:23:55] <+TranquiloArman> @PatStaresAt I was looking at old stream vods and damn Gief got big lol. He was so tiny back then
[6:23:56] <filialpails> slow down there JKR
[6:23:56] <ammobasket> I need goblins to lick they chops like that nonstop
[6:23:57] <%waltzqueen> I thought Dwarves liked gold and living underground
[6:24:00] <$chance_h> Knoll baby
[6:24:48] <$chance_h> Blame translations between Japan and American back in the 80s/90s
[6:25:16] <%pectusumbra> terraria summoner is pretty fun. you can even get the castlevania whip and everything
[6:25:23] <%RealThiele> STAY AWAY FROM THE SUMMONER
[6:25:26] <roguemephilesclone> Magic: The Gathering Battlegrounds is on PC and it still holds up.
[6:25:33] <%pectusumbra> Lost Kingdoms is a Fromsoft game pretty much all about summoning
[6:25:36] <%Blank9> Folklore is a good summoning action game for ps3
[6:25:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> Folklore is a GREAT game with summon mechanics
[6:25:56] <+Undenizen> eyyy just arrived! what we doin!
[6:26:09] <%Maids4lyfe> ending
[6:26:19] <+Undenizen> oh.
[6:26:28] <%twistedj3ster> that's awful! I'm sorry Cozy
[6:26:36] <Profmcstevie> Tool theft is infuriating, gotta lock your van down like a safe
[6:27:02] <%Cozy90> @twistedj3ster its ok. the day just dragged cuz i had to do everything by hand.
[6:27:22] <Profmcstevie> What? Hub and levels and all?
[6:27:23] <%dekkitout> How's the history of dark souls total conversion mods?
[6:27:27] <%Cozy90> we were out in ther countryside so i didnt think we were in danger but i guess i was wrong.
[6:27:29] <Muzaki_Lopez> hi pat & chat jundHi
[6:27:37] <%shurtal> @PatStaresAt have you ever seen the 80's commercial for Ayds diet plan?
[6:27:37] <%Futurecity10> Pat whens the Halo Dark souls mod
[6:27:41] <%twistedj3ster> As a mechanic I can't imagine doing that
[6:27:45] <%SpontaneousC> So apparently Sekiro has one of these full rework mods now too called Resurrection
[6:27:47] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I've seen like, Bloodborne bosses straight ported to DS3
[6:27:53] <%capnshupe> @pectusumbra TIL that lost kingdoms is a fromsoft game, and that also explains why it destroyed me as a kid lol
[6:28:10] <+Thyzoon> Heide's Tower yep
[6:28:13] <moonmintparadise> thats heides tower
[6:28:13] <%SpontaneousC> yo that's hade's tower
[6:28:19] <%Maids4lyfe> yep
[6:28:22] <unfathomarble> yup
[6:28:23] <Jim_Placebo> That's Heide's Tower of Flame, holy shit
[6:28:23] <SaltyAzteca> heides flame i think?
[6:28:24] <simply_swayze> Yeah, that's Heide's Tower
[6:28:26] <%linSP> WHAT
[6:28:33] <%ElkRiverDog> I get the impression that a lot of DeS and DS modders just want an alternative to UnReal engine build kits
[6:28:34] <%greasypete00> that's heides tower of flame
[6:28:35] <moonmintparadise> custom bosses too
[6:28:47] <%pectusumbra> @pectusumbra one of the ones they will NEVER go back to and I will always be sad about. Also can see the clear parallels to demon souls with the monster-filled fog and all
[6:28:51] <Bird_iq> how are u pat
[6:29:13] <+Thyzoon> @PatStaresAt They even recreated the Demons' Souls tutorial section
[6:29:13] <+Mrbaconator> as kiryu would say that's rad
[6:29:23] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt there's a mod for DS1 called Nightfall coming this year with a demo releasing this month
[6:29:27] <%linSP> funny how lighting is a game changer
[6:29:59] <roguemephilesclone> Oh yeah, Lost Kingdoms 1 and 2 are FromSoftware games I think are cool.
[6:30:08] <DianaTheAscian> OH IT'S THIS MOD
[6:30:08] <Muzaki_Lopez> Ornstein jundPog
[6:30:19] <DXLelouch24> oh god these two at once
[6:30:23] <DXLelouch24> oh god
[6:30:26] <%dekkitout> Wow- that is a spitroast of a boss fight
[6:30:32] <DXLelouch24> we need to get Max to boss rage this mod
[6:30:34] <%greasypete00> what is that helmet
[6:30:38] <%JoshManVGH> WTF
[6:30:40] <%Blank9> ornstein is kinda a punk by comparison
[6:30:41] <gespenstkick> I want that stupid hat
[6:30:46] <BliVru> @patstaresat i fear im gonna go "cant wait for Elden Ring mods" and not play at all
[6:30:48] <+quackisalive> Isn't that just nameless
[6:30:51] <%pectusumbra> @roguemephilesclone I actually made the effort to get lost kingdoms 1 legit last year. Will look forward to a replay of it, been a LONG time. Also the Fromsoft legacy of the first one being much better than the 2nd
[6:30:59] <+Undenizen> it looks very.... moddy.
[6:31:01] <simply_swayze> That seems excessive
[6:31:24] <BliVru> and champions ashes just adds the bloodbore weapons
[6:31:31] <%joodatious> looks like pats feeling himself up when his hand is under the keyboard
[6:31:33] <%Agami23> which one is it thats adding amagdyla?
[6:31:34] <+carafe741> what's been your favorite (or most anticipated) mod so far?
[6:31:40] <%Blank9> Lost Kingdoms 1 is pretty funny for having the same setup as Demon's Souls, with the colorless fog
[6:31:55] <BlueTunicLink> Bending a CPU pin monkaS
[6:31:58] <$chance_h> They should mod in Among Us to Dark souls
[6:31:59] <%dekkitout> That's a five point hat trick of crazy
[6:31:59] <%Cozy90> trex rides hitler??
[6:32:01] <%JoshManVGH> What movie is this?
[6:32:02] <%JonathLP> iron sky?
[6:32:04] <%RealThiele> wat
[6:32:13] <%Maids4lyfe> Iron Sky 2
[6:32:15] <+Undenizen> wait, a trex-riding hiler or a trex riding hitler?
[6:32:15] <DBLfinish> Out of curiosity can u install these mods on ps5 ds3???
[6:32:20] <$Cthulos> Sky Nazis
[6:32:22] <DBLfinish> @patstaresat
[6:32:24] <%Cozy90> hitler must be huge to have a trex ride him
[6:32:30] <%Maids4lyfe> hitler riding a t-rex
[6:32:33] <%joodatious> @DBLfinish lmao no
[6:32:43] <DBLfinish> Awww mannnn
[6:32:45] <$chance_h> He’s a big guy
[6:32:48] <DBLfinish> Ripp
[6:32:48] <Muzaki_Lopez> mein t-rex
[6:32:53] <DBLfinish> Looks SO sick
[6:32:55] <%Maids4lyfe> sony does not allow mods
[6:33:02] <%walternatorz> hahahaha
[6:33:07] <%doomunderthestairs> yes
[6:33:10] <+Undenizen> no, pat has no interest in fromsoft games.
[6:33:13] <DBLfinish> Figure there be a way tongonaround
[6:33:16] <%dekkitout> It's a pretty good boondoggle
[6:33:18] <Profmcstevie> Beautiful painterly world that you roam and find monsters
[6:33:21] <Profmcstevie> Elden Ring wooooh!
[6:33:28] <%mr_sups> I would love that

[6:34:10] <Treasure_Vault> peace brothers
[6:34:12] <@Ranryu692> g'night Pat, thanks for the stream!
[6:34:13] <%JoshManVGH> Elden Ring in a nutshell: "Something something gods something something corruption thou thine yor go kill them."
[6:34:16] <%joodatious> IRON KEEP SUCKS
[6:34:20] <DianaTheAscian> iron keep is pretty boring
[6:34:21] <%greasypete00> thanks for the stream it was great
