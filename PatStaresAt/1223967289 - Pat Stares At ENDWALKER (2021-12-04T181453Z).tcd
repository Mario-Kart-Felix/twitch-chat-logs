[0:04:16] <gryffinp> @InternetShis My paladin feels taniker than he used to
[0:04:25] <RushUnplugged> @InternetShis my BLM went from 100k crits to barely 10k, it's rough
[0:04:26] <%Dakuu75> So, belts are gone now right? Does that mean belt-stats got added to the other slots?
[0:04:43] <%InternetShis> I feel like GNB is a bit weaker before the 123 potency trait

[0:04:59] <+Wrashis> Wrashis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[0:05:02] <Zarkith> @Dakuu75 Nah, it just means the stat squish didn't squish as hard as it would have if there were still belts
[0:05:03] <%VictorVonLouche> @Dakuu75 Dont think so they just merged the new stats you get without the extra item slot from the squish i think
[0:05:27] <%InternetShis> In terms of actual percentage damage, GNB feels weaker jumping back in

[0:14:04] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Significant Other NotLikeThis
[0:14:05] <%X2Eliah> Duct-tape a vibrator to the analog stick and turn it on
[0:14:06] <%EynoStiles> @patstaresat I still cant believe people go in run the whole expansion, get to the end, and never play the game again till next update.
[0:14:08] <%RealThiele> i set a 15 min repeating phone timer

[0:14:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> USe a macro?
[0:14:34] <gryffinp> what if I use an autohotkey macro to jump once every ten minutes
[0:14:41] <%InternetShis> Significant Other? I don't even knower!
[0:14:50] <%transporterthesequel> Yep. I played for 16 hours yesterday. Did NOT regret.
[0:14:50] <%X2Eliah> No but use a GOOD macro
[0:14:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> OKay I don't play 14
[0:14:51] <Blank9> I've had no problems logging in
[0:14:52] <SinisterBroccoli> So I haven't seen anyone talk about it but Crystal seems unaffected by server congestion?

[0:15:33] <%JoshManVGH> The only risk of a drinking chicken is a nuclear meltdown
[0:15:35] <%InternetShis> But the poop!
[0:15:36] <$tehbeardedbard> glad to see you are not a potatoe
[0:15:40] <%X2Eliah> Drinking chickens are also very periodic, could trigger the macro-detection algorithm

[0:17:30] <RinWR> @X2Eliah He's tabbed out
[0:17:34] <%Dakuu75> @X2Eliah I think because he's alt-tabbed on a different window

[0:17:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Still can't successfully download the update
[0:17:51] <%king_wragles> it's cause Pat's running this on a 960

[0:23:00] <%LongRangeHands> LongRangeHands subscribed with Prime. 
[0:23:02] <SaltyAzteca> breaking point?
[0:23:04] <%transporterthesequel> @KineticZen same, actually!
[0:23:05] <%cooldude69xx> FF14, good?
[0:23:07] <%InternetShis> WELP.
[0:23:09] <BigYanno> WE'RE GIVIN HER ALL SHE'S GOT CAP'N
[0:23:11] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Ooh fire hazard
[0:23:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Doctor disable my login inhibitors
[0:23:25] <chris_babaganoosh05> NA servers are doing relatively well, EU is FUCKED from what I've heard
[0:23:28] <%Trypp2Phan> I've only seen it get to around 5k on Midgardsormr. I think we got lucky
[0:23:53] <+ReiDuran> Like, literally most semiconductors that the world uses come out of literally one place in Taiwan and not only did Covid happen, they also had a HUUUUUUGE drought at the same time.
[0:23:55] <%X2Eliah> Geez that's some bs
[0:23:58] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:24:04] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Ehh
[0:24:09] <%InternetShis> Technology
[0:24:12] <%InternetShis> AEUGH
[0:24:15] <xxshadowxx416> pat how are you in
[0:24:19] <RinWR> @chris_babaganoosh05 Eu here, a friend of mine had a crash but other than that it's been running fine once inside the game
[0:24:23] <+boki_86> i was at nr 1 in queue and got error 4004 now i am at 8k lol fml
[0:24:26] <%alcors_wisdom> since log in servers are non essential to the game server infrastructure (its essentially just way to form a line) they could be boosting them with external host servers
[0:24:28] <RinWR> Small sample size of course, but eh
[0:24:30] <%X2Eliah> @ReiDuran Its gonne get even worse in next year when mainland china finally takes over taiwan.
[0:24:31] <%SWFanatic> help computer, stop all the downloadin
[0:24:44] <engineboi> This is gonna be a good stream, I just played this part.
[0:24:44] <%KineticZen> 600 person queue on Crystal this morning, took like 5 min.
[0:24:44] <%valriot> LUL
[0:24:49] <tigerfang86> pat shaking his tiny baby fists
[0:24:49] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:24:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> to be fair people spoiled the shit out of you during Shadowbringers
[0:24:54] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[0:24:55] <$StrawberryPantsu> 83 dungeon? I'm already level 85
[0:24:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> PJSalt
[0:24:56] <RinWR> I finished the lvl 83 dungeon :)
[0:24:56] <%TheAntiNihilist> Ye
[0:24:57] <%InternetShis> LUL
[0:24:58] <+MelodyMedley> LUL
[0:24:59] <%Dakuu75> no one tell Pat that Level 85 comes after level 84
[0:25:00] <BigYanno> PAT!? OVERREACTING!? NEVER!!!
[0:25:02] <@goose_attack_almanac> I don't even play this game. The only stuff I know is from Pat's streams.
[0:25:02] <+JustToWatch> FF14 just set a personal record with 92k concurrent
[0:25:04] <%UvBenServed> There's a level 83 dungeon? SPOILERS
[0:25:05] <+BIumen> when you got mad someone "spoiled" the shb tank quest
[0:25:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> I already download, beat, and uninstalled all of FFXVI in the last 2 days Kappa
[0:25:14] <%VictorVonLouche> tbh the lvl layout for dungeons is every odd numbers like ShB it seems
[0:25:16] <vavilonica> funny man angry funny
[0:25:18] <+TuskDeluxe> PAT the next TRIAL is so hard to find in party finder it's sooooo bad
[0:25:18] <%InternetShis> snuffOmegalul
[0:25:19] <%SWFanatic> psaBig psaFist
[0:25:20] <%KineticZen> Hypertuned (against spoilers) Pat
[0:25:20] <SaltyAzteca> I'd more say youre dodgin spoilers like Neo dodges bullets
[0:25:23] <+ReiDuran> @ReiDuran I think other places are gearing up for more production, but it just takes real-ass time for that to happen.
[0:25:24] <chris_babaganoosh05> Haven't even touched MSQ, managed to get Sage to 75 before work
[0:25:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat is always full Gamer
[0:25:31] <%cooldude69xx> 85? spoilers!
[0:25:36] <%Dakuu75> that dude probably shit his pants when Pat freaked out
[0:25:36] <%InternetShis> It's perfectly fine and 100% understandable
[0:25:45] <+ReiDuran> Wait is Sage bad?
[0:25:45] <BigYanno> So pat have you been watching Hawkeye? Episode 3 is great!
[0:25:48] <%InternetShis> Oh... oh no
[0:25:53] <+ReiDuran> I couldn't wrap my head around Sage.
[0:25:54] <+boki_86> there are already Spoiler YT videos i hate it, they use Spoiler thumbnails @PatStaresAt
[0:25:58] <%InternetShis> Sages are all just grinding

[0:26:08] <%valriot> YEP LUL
[0:26:10] <+Shikari21> thats my reaction right now at level 87
[0:26:12] <%shurtal> i agree with Darius
[0:26:14] <%InternetShis> Bozja is FULL of Reapers and Sages
[0:26:16] <%transporterthesequel> I'm...I'm at zone 4. Uh huh.
[0:26:17] <%veetalis> How's your quest for Bunnyman been going Pat?
[0:26:17] <+JustToWatch> oh no, he spoiled that this is a video game
[0:26:18] <SaltyAzteca> oof
[0:26:19] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yeah ok
[0:26:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Pat starts Arcana Hearts threads on /v/! Kappa
[0:26:29] <%shurtal> THAT SOUNDS LIKE ROULETTE RIGHT NOW
[0:26:33] <chris_babaganoosh05> OOPS ALL REAPERS

[0:26:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oof

[0:26:51] <%transporterthesequel> That was...a TRIP.
[0:26:54] <thehullowed> Say, has that guy that comes and leaves every 8 months showed up?
[0:26:55] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Every party is PLD, SAGE, RPR, RPR
[0:27:00] <%InternetShis> Yeah I'm just gonna unsync ARR EX for wondrous tails
[0:27:10] <%zyberion626> oh wow I crashed AT THE EXACT SAME PLACE
[0:27:16] <%transporterthesequel> Sage thankfully, is STUPID powerful in low level content.

[0:27:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Also F
[0:27:49] <+snausages_> Sage feel like SCH that leans into more passive healing, and no cool pet shenanigans
[0:27:54] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Brawls BibleThump
[0:27:54] <%JGardner03> Here I am listening to the stream at work, hoping Pat progresses a little slow today hoping I stay ahead LUL

[0:28:59] <@Velyndra> HMM
[0:29:00] <+JustToWatch> I still remember the infamous deathcast episode
[0:29:01] <%shurtal> We believe you pat
[0:29:02] <%valriot> Kappa
[0:29:02] <SaltyAzteca> Bragging rights revoked :(
[0:29:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:29:03] <@Velyndra> SOUNDS LIKE A CONSPIRACY
[0:29:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> HMMMM

[0:29:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> SUS

[0:29:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> SURE YOU DID
[0:29:21] <%cooldude69xx> good cover tho
[0:29:22] <%alcors_wisdom> as to lived as cursed i think its because of the red hair between you and me
[0:29:24] <mr_saturday93> Crazy talked the hard drives
[0:29:30] <%JGardner03> Punished Pat : A man denied his bragging rights
[0:29:37] <KidKaiser23> Dis music is beautiful
[0:29:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why is  glowing squirl checking you out?
[0:29:47] <%Birdigalore> I bet it was Minh! lol jk
[0:29:52] <SFdvus> Kirby air ride is goated
[0:30:00] <@Velyndra> PICK 13
[0:30:02] <%shurtal> EXCEPT 2
[0:30:03] <%InternetShis> I started with 15
[0:30:04] <$StrawberryPantsu> Don't pick 2
[0:30:04] <@goose_attack_almanac> 13-2, got you
[0:30:05] <Bert_Karlsson> Final Fantasy X-2
[0:30:08] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Pick 1
[0:30:08] <%alcors_wisdom> @JGardner03 pretty good
[0:30:09] <DragonBornKing> ok ill start with X-2
[0:30:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> LUL
[0:30:09] <$StrawberryPantsu> Don't pick 3
[0:30:12] <Comb711> start with the movie
[0:30:12] <engineboi> FF fans have the most disagreement on what the best ones are tbh
[0:30:13] <chris_babaganoosh05> Just play 4 4Head
[0:30:14] <+tr1ps_ax1om> i came in at ff1 when i was 8 years old
[0:30:14] <+YPFrost> yeah mt first game was 13 :)
[0:30:15] <%X2Eliah> FF14 is *really great* for people who hate the other FF games
[0:30:17] <Davimotion96> Same as Jojo, am I right?
[0:30:18] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Playing the pixel remasters now and having my crew be the warrior of darkness
[0:30:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Final Fantasy Jumbo
[0:30:22] <+Gregmeyer> start with 13-3 Lightning Returns
[0:30:24] <0rbis> hope todays a good one pat
[0:30:26] <%SuckerPunchSyd> My first was also 13
[0:30:27] <$StrawberryPantsu> Final Fantasy starts at 4
[0:30:27] <Edible_Enthusiasm> non-sequential. all with different quirks between junctions, traits and materia
[0:30:28] <JetpackMcQuack> you'll get at least a 7
[0:30:28] <%Birdigalore> Start at 13,cuz then it can only go up in quality
[0:30:30] <+acridpaladin> but i like 2....
[0:30:30] <Daskolin> Damn. I had ff7 dics 2 not load in my childhood =\
[0:30:31] <+BlackSunEmperor> i got in with 13 and i love it
[0:30:32] <%solracc25> get in 7
[0:30:32] <%Birdigalore> or 2
[0:30:32] <KidKaiser23> The answer is Kingdom Hearts 2
[0:30:33] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Nah play 2 Kappa
[0:30:35] <Daskolin> That was a bummer
[0:30:35] <artoflec> nobody's gonna go to bad for FF2, there are people that love XIII at least.
[0:30:37] <+ZoltanBMagnus> X-2 has good music
[0:30:38] <%VictorVonLouche> They're all isolated stories. Except 14 where you want to play ALL of them so you can point and go neat reference.
[0:30:38] <SaltyAzteca> Just play somethin else
[0:30:38] <+sonofthedeepsouth> And 13
[0:30:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> Ultros adventurer in need for alliance is DPS, get in there reapers
[0:30:42] <%SuckerPunchSyd> And I played 4 minutes and was like fuck this
[0:30:44] <%ClericOfSparda> I heard TA was good?
[0:30:45] <TioXyco> 8 is better than ff2 and ff13 series still
[0:30:45] <%JGardner03> Don't play 7, that's old go do Remake
[0:30:45] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Play tactics tho
[0:30:47] <$StrawberryPantsu> 13-2 is dope as hell
[0:30:47] <%shurtal> FF STARTS AT CHRYSTAL CHRONICALS
[0:30:48] <%AHomeschoolDropout> so is final fantasy like the resident evil series where half the franchise is actually garbage
[0:30:48] <+acridpaladin> Whats wrong with ff2?
[0:30:50] <@goose_attack_almanac> Tactics Advanced is actually good though. and THEN you play the original
[0:30:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> FFT is the shit
[0:30:51] <PersonifiedTFT> ???????????? Tactics Advance fucking slaps
[0:30:52] <engineboi> I have a friend who played 2 on GBA and he's like the only person I know who beat it and enjoyed it.
[0:30:55] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Kingdom Hearts 358/2 days. Got it!
[0:30:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Tactics advance is good tho
[0:30:56] <%solracc25> @kidkaiser23 yes KH 2
[0:30:57] <+VirtuousInk_> It's like anime filler, play 1-10 NOT 11-13, then play 14 through 16
[0:30:58] <+DeRedBaron> damn i actually liked FFTA. i hated FFTA 2
[0:31:07] <+ReiDuran> The actual answer is probably 10. Even though I don't really like 10.
[0:31:09] <%X2Eliah> Metal Gear Solid 5 is the best Final Fantasy, btw.
[0:31:20] <%lucky_icarus> Yo Pat. GNB Heart of Corundum is SICK AS FUCK!
[0:31:25] <+boki_86> maybe in 6.3
[0:31:26] <%AquilaHarukaze> Warrior is INCREDIBLE in endwalker
[0:31:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Play metal gear NES
[0:31:40] <+snausages_> DRK is the only tonk I've ever played tbh
[0:31:41] <TioXyco> @sonofthedeepsouth that doesn't exist
[0:31:45] <KidKaiser23> Another great FF entry is Butt Ugly Martians on GBA
[0:31:45] <engineboi> Imagine if Salted Earth healed you
[0:31:49] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I thought DRK had a leech as a part of their normal rotation?
[0:31:53] <TioXyco> @sonofthedeepsouth I mean, exists, but its so bad it doesn't LUL
[0:32:04] <TioXyco> warrior has EVERY heal LUL
[0:32:10] <PersonifiedTFT> @Edible_Enthusiasm Every tank does, DRK has nothing else and theirs is the weakest
[0:32:11] <%IKilledADeadGuy> IKilledADeadGuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months, currently on a 56 month streak! Hello Pat. I hope you enjoy your endwalking and your number go up big.
[0:32:16] <%SWFanatic> psaGib
[0:32:17] <Comb711> Pally has so much heal it makes it feel weird healing in dungeons with them
[0:32:17] <+snausages_> That sounds rly boring if you're a healer playing with warrior
[0:32:23] <+ReiDuran> DRK had to be crippled so SMN could fly.
[0:32:23] <Edible_Enthusiasm> @Edible_Enthusiasm oh :V
[0:32:26] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Thats Balanced Pat Kappa
[0:32:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Edible_Enthusiasm a tiny one tho
[0:32:32] <xxshadowxx416> should that not be dark knight thing
[0:32:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> DRK deserved it Kappa
[0:32:38] <+tr1ps_ax1om> you get to die if you dont get bene!
[0:32:45] <%X2Eliah> No but DRK tanking is just tanking at a different plane of enlightment.
[0:32:46] <chris_babaganoosh05> DRK died so RPR could fly
[0:32:46] <%PrimalDweeb> It's all just gibberish to me... LUL
[0:32:51] <carp_> tbn is a 25% hp shield... that's way more than all of those potencies, and brutal shell is hardly higher than siphon strike
[0:32:54] <TioXyco> but DRK thing is taking life, not healing
[0:32:54] <engineboi> @PatStaresAt Do you think DRK is gonna get patched a bunch like Monk during Shadowbringers?
[0:32:55] <%SWFanatic> how can you be a knight of death if you heal yourself
[0:32:57] <AlexDaGr8> DRK buttons work how they should have last expansion, nice buff
[0:33:01] <tanithmagnus> doesn't DRK need self sustain to take advantage of Walking Dead?
[0:33:04] <TioXyco> also Abyssal Drain, no? it also heals you, no?
[0:33:04] <Dragovus> Final Fantasy stares at Pat Walker
[0:33:09] <%cooldude69xx> Dark knight sounds like they had it too good for too long
[0:33:13] <%InternetShis> Glad they ran DRK into the ground with ShB so they could shoot it behind the shed in EW
[0:33:17] <+DeRedBaron> shares a cool down, gained MP regen but carve and spit isn't a heal so why
[0:33:19] <%Monkeyweed21> the Greased Lightning problem
[0:33:25] <+snausages_> tbh as a healer I rly hate when tonks use too much self heal, let me see your health get low like limbo so I can make things spicy
[0:33:29] <+Gregmeyer> DRK got upgraded to a DPS called Reaper
[0:33:38] <%watts121> It's fine but boring.
[0:33:38] <chris_babaganoosh05> TBN also actually fucks you over if the shield doesn't break
[0:33:40] <carp_> but you weren't talking about fun, you were talking about healing potencies. I agree, dark knight is janky and boring
[0:33:40] <JetpackMcQuack> did you add the x factor
[0:33:46] <RushUnplugged> @tanithmagnus WD is still by far the worst invul and it usually ends in death unless you're in voice chat with hte healer
[0:33:50] <%valriot> xenoSTEER
[0:33:57] <$StrawberryPantsu> Another bald red head
[0:33:59] <+tr1ps_ax1om> hahaha I was at 30 in queue and it errored out now i'm @ 2k :F
[0:34:09] <%InternetShis> Oh yeah Xenosys
[0:34:20] <KidKaiser23> Pat, sorry if someone else asked, have you played as Reaper or Sage yet?
[0:34:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:34:24] <%SWFanatic> psaBig
[0:34:26] <+sonofthedeepsouth> MUH DPS
[0:34:29] <%AHomeschoolDropout> The best part of Walking Dead is the WoL using it against you
[0:34:29] <%shurtal> wanna go brrrrr
[0:34:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> MUH DUHMAGE
[0:34:33] <%InternetShis> Apparently VIII materia has better stats than X?
[0:34:35] <%AquilaHarukaze> It's not even that it's a high number but the number is VISUALLY BIGGER
[0:34:40] <%valriot> DH just needs to buff DH damage tbh
[0:34:41] <engineboi> Would DRK be better if it had a Dark Confitteor?
[0:34:46] <+DeRedBaron> also it feels like LIving dead pushes it to have no heals cus for some reason it feels like they dont want you to be able to keep yourself from dying
[0:34:52] <+Local16> Big number make brain feel good
[0:34:55] <%Trypp2Phan> Can confirm, bigger number feels incredible
[0:34:56] <chris_babaganoosh05> NUMBER GO UP NOT DOWN BIG NUMBER ONLY
[0:35:03] <%watts121> my main issue is DRK just feels like lame WAR
[0:35:09] <%lucky_icarus> My heart dropped when I saw GNB got a lot of lost potency on skills cause my big number was no longer as big.
[0:35:11] <%transporterthesequel> I'm not Pat, played both though. Sage is OP in low level stuff. Reaper is, PRESS YOUR SUPER BUTTONS NOW STOP EVERTYHING AND PRESS.
[0:35:17] <TioXyco> but here's the thing: if you focus on specializing with one job, would you really need to gear up for other jobs?
[0:35:18] <%solracc25> psaBig number
[0:35:20] <%Trypp2Phan> Can't do the 5-long fel cleave chains anymore, but our healing feels way more consistent
[0:35:20] <%X2Eliah> Well it is only fair, you play the edgelord class, you get to suffer.
[0:35:28] <%IKilledADeadGuy> Some people play Yun to win. Some people play Q because fuck you I wanna have fun
[0:35:31] <Frostydough1> did you just say ALL THE WARRIORS
[0:35:33] <%InternetShis> So what is DRK good forM
[0:35:34] <burgerpantsed> like when i was playing drk i was consistently pulling really good DPS in everything i was doing, but it never felt as good as any other tanks to play
[0:35:34] <carp_> it has the dragoon problem where its damage is fine but it feels like you're doing less because you don't have BIG NUMBER
[0:35:40] <engineboi> I miss when Clemency crit for 100k heals
[0:35:43] <%SWFanatic> good stream, ty for stream, stream over
[0:35:50] <+Phantomjay> what happened to the vaction plans?
[0:35:55] <SaltyAzteca> Back into the fantasy
[0:36:09] <engineboi> Dragoon has Stardiver
[0:36:25] <%zyberion626> as of rn, it seems there are far less 2002's but the queues are moving slower
[0:36:26] <%transporterthesequel> See this is why you play for 16 hours straight to get ahead of Pat to watch strim.
[0:36:28] <RushUnplugged> I moved from DRK to GNB and my fun significantly improved
[0:36:29] <engineboi> Upgraded Soul Eater
[0:36:30] <%valriot> DRG is simple but its COOL
[0:36:35] <Frostydough1> honestly i think thats really helpful
[0:36:47] <%Dakuu75> like in games, when you run. you need the woosh lines to make it FEEL like you're going fast
[0:36:51] <%InternetShis> GNB sounds great with Hypervelocity
[0:36:52] <tuesti> man i'm loving endwalker at the moment
[0:36:55] <PersonifiedTFT> I want to hit a BIG BUTTON and see a BIG NUMBER
[0:36:56] <RushUnplugged> nono, MORE complaining about DRK
[0:36:58] <engineboi> I feel like Edge of Shadow looks cool
[0:37:01] <JetpackMcQuack> the dark night class should be all about empty aesthetics
[0:37:05] <Drega707> DRK felt fine to me honestly, job flows fine,
[0:37:05] <JetpackMcQuack> knight
[0:37:07] <engineboi> I love popping Edge of Shadow as DRK
[0:37:12] <ricotez> catJAM
[0:37:18] <%JoshManVGH> Go to school and write dissertation on why DRK is not fun
[0:37:21] <%InternetShis> Leave negativity at the door, you're at scholl now
[0:37:22] <RushUnplugged> it's good and right to complain about DRK because it's bad to play and it's a shame

[0:54:20] <%Solareon_> Studium i think
[0:54:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[0:54:22] <%strugglepunk2> The Studium
[0:54:23] <+acridpaladin> hydrocity
[0:54:23] <+tempestzephyr> hydrocity
[0:54:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> This old man doesn't know about sineaters
[0:54:28] <rmwolfe> is this a crystal chronicles song
[0:54:29] <%frydaynitefight> thunderdome

[0:54:43] <sirrice77> i would have such a hard time writing the final fantasy font
[0:54:53] <%zyberion626> [STRENG GEHEIM]
[0:54:57] <Saltmeisterr> wut
[0:54:58] <+wizard_of_diamonds> ...
[0:54:59] <%watts121> that sounds fucked...like it could be abused
[0:55:13] <%InternetShis> Just drown out the memories
[0:55:20] <+BIumen> they really went back and explained this god damn
[0:55:29] <%X2Eliah> wow
[0:55:39] <themountaindwarf> fixing is a strong word
[0:55:42] <%JoshManVGH> Not familiar
[0:55:44] <$EsotericOdyssey> NICE
[0:55:44] <themountaindwarf> just make shit up
[0:55:50] <$EsotericOdyssey> THEY FILLED THAT HOLE
[0:55:50] <%transporterthesequel> Ishikawa the GAWD
[0:55:56] <+OneGorillionDollars> That is the LAST thing I expected an In-universe explanation for
[0:55:59] <%solracc25> plot crater filled
[0:56:07] <+cappyd33> LOUISOUX GREATEST WIZARD OF ALL TIME
[0:56:09] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I thought grandpa poofed everyone away for... a time period
[0:56:11] <%X2Eliah> @themountaindwarf yeah that's how fictional stories in fictional worlds work
[0:56:23] <%PocketBearIllustrator> so does that mean louixois made everyone forget about the warriors of light?
[0:56:27] <%solracc25> Two week delay guys, fill all the holes
[0:56:28] <%king_wragles> it has been used to manipulate the populace, calling it now
[0:56:28] <%Dakuu75> a contrivance that SOMEONE has been bitching about for 8 years, I'm sure
[0:56:31] <%king_wragles> that flag is GIANT
[0:56:31] <%Wulfphelz> Plot wrinkle been flattened
[0:56:33] <tanarath> oh no
[0:56:33] <themountaindwarf> well yeah
[0:56:36] <themountaindwarf> thats what i said
[0:56:39] <Louie_Salmon> Wait so it is possible?
[0:56:58] <%X2Eliah> This is big premonition
[0:57:00] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He's gotta die and come back to explain things
[0:57:05] <%RealThiele> what if the lifestream was NFTs
[0:57:06] <%crimsonharvest> like the Fade in DRagon Age?
[0:57:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Dude
[0:57:09] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What if
[0:57:11] <%AHomeschoolDropout> This expansion has been calling back to 1.0 and 2.0 a lot so there's probably some crazy ass shit near the end
[0:57:11] <Edible_Enthusiasm> pluck y'shtola's eyesight from the lifestream
[0:57:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What the fuck
[0:57:14] <%zyberion626> @patstaresat I worry everyone is going to forget about us...again
[0:57:14] <MidnightPacif1c> its just over there LUL
[0:57:22] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What if the Noise that drove the Ancients mad was the Lifestream!?
[0:57:24] <%Monkeyweed21> ARE WE GONNA ASK A GHOST FORUM MEMBER SOME SHIT
[0:57:25] <+JustToWatch> we're gonna go there and beat up naked Sephiroth
[0:57:27] <%solracc25> so Aerith is allive?
[0:57:30] <+OneGorillionDollars> the Lifestream is NGE LCL LUL
[0:57:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Because they almost never died it was like some sort of imbalance of life/death?
[0:57:37] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Got, kill members of the forum until at least 9/10 of the remainders are okay with removing the mind control.
[0:57:42] <%InternetShis> Somehow Exdeath will be there
[0:57:43] <+acridpaladin> this super sounds like its headed to the lifestream
[0:57:43] <+MelodyMedley> There's totally gonna be some crazy stuff huh
[0:57:48] <@Velyndra> Just a heads up, he wrote "welcome to the studium", aka the building you're in
[0:57:54] <%X2Eliah> Wait, this *could* be a mechanism to explain a "New Game +" reset
[0:57:57] <%RealThiele> 100% pure accept no substitutes
[0:57:58] <%Dakuu75> is he talking about the life stream?
[0:57:58] <AlexDaGr8> yeah this is literal lifestream talk
[0:58:02] <%X2Eliah> for the player char
[0:58:04] <+cappyd33> like a realm REBORN
[0:58:07] <critfumble_> instrumentality project
[0:58:09] <+cappyd33> WINK
[0:58:11] <tanithmagnus> well some of them do
[0:58:12] <%SWFanatic> that cat potato can't see over the desk
[0:58:13] <%frydaynitefight> Tidus
[0:58:14] <%Wulfphelz> Primordial Aether
[0:58:16] <xxshadowxx416> life
[0:58:19] <televisedrevolting> Turns out: the moon is just a giant server room that holds character data. Just hard boot characters back to life.
[0:58:33] <+wizard_of_diamonds> ...He may actually be talking about us
[0:58:41] <SaltyAzteca> Magiiiiiiic
[0:58:44] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Depending on what he knows he could literally be trying to subtly talk to you
[0:58:54] <Frostydough1> we have the amnesia
[0:58:54] <Daskolin> WoL looks like his brain exploded lol
[0:58:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Or all of our future dead friends back
[0:58:58] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[0:58:58] <%JoshManVGH> We all have to die?
[0:58:59] <%AquilaHarukaze> @televisedrevolting So you're saying the NieR collab goes deeper
[0:59:02] <+acridpaladin> they described 2 methods.
[0:59:13] <DynzelWashington> That'd be cool
[0:59:33] <+cappyd33> hey par
[0:59:38] <+cappyd33> hey pat
[0:59:44] <+MelodyMedley> This expansion sure is something
[0:59:49] <Louie_Salmon> Dark souls NPC laugh
[0:59:53] <+cappyd33> remember the orange juice
[0:59:59] <%JoshManVGH> Is the final area the missing time between 1.0 and 2.0?
[1:00:00] <Edible_Enthusiasm> just gonna hamfist some forgotten events into 2.0?
[1:00:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> wait....i have an idea where the plot may lead...
[1:00:18] <AlexDaGr8> alphinaud looks p popular
[1:00:28] <GandhiTheTerrible> probably Studium deliveries
[1:00:32] <+cappyd33> i want to meet real yda
[1:00:35] <%TheCallousKing> TheCallousKing subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! Hey Pat! Hope all is well with you, Paige, Gief and Elmo. Really enjoying the EW streams. Keep doing what you do.
[1:00:39] <%RealThiele> is it good
[1:00:41] <%solracc25> what is that dot grid on the lower right corner?
[1:00:50] <Daskolin> Imagine boosting to endwalker and skipping everything before it LUL LUL LUL
[1:01:04] <%InternetShis> It most certainly was not a plan, but this newfound explanation makes new story beats possible
[1:01:23] <%Monkeyweed21> like WoW retcons are super obvious because they contradict what came before
[1:01:28] <AlexDaGr8> i'm fully willing to believe "they intended to do SOMETHING like this eventually when they wrote ARR"
[1:01:28] <%JoshManVGH> @daskolin I already feel like I need to go back and do all the raid series quests I missed...
[1:01:30] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I do have a question regarding Amon, though. was he the same Amon we fought at the Crystal Tower?
[1:01:31] <+Shikari21> nice
[1:01:36] <Ids560> sick

[1:01:58] <%solracc25> cool chainscyte
[1:02:00] <$StrawberryPantsu> Or Wisp depending
[1:02:09] <+MelodyMedley> Sick
[1:02:14] <Daskolin> @JoshManVGH I literally want to use New game +, because of endwalker  :D
[1:02:24] <%Dakuu75> jesus fucking christ, Pat
[1:02:30] <Daxalog> Was that Saging?
[1:02:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt The difference between a retcon and retroactive plot hooks is how the fandom reacts to it
[1:02:38] <%AquilaHarukaze> @PocketBearIllustrator The one we fight is supposedly a clone he left behind
[1:02:47] <%JoshManVGH> Nice! So that line in the sage first quest about wishing to have the power to save really rang out when Vltra was speaking.
[1:03:00] <%InternetShis> Purge the bars

[1:39:29] <Bert_Karlsson> @aBusyWizard +2
[1:39:29] <+OneGorillionDollars> what are you doing steppe bro?
[1:39:33] <%InternetShis> What are you doing, Steppe bro?
[1:39:34] <%RealThiele> this dialogue is different if you dont do Bozja
[1:39:42] <VioletRosefall> actual acknowledge you did non-main story quests
[1:39:56] <+Aokaay> i love when they do this kind of thing
[1:40:00] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I'm gonna go back to this expansion in NG+
[1:40:01] <AllenDeadman> it sucks that eureka and bozja takes so long to do
[1:40:02] <ricotez> it's so small, just a few line changes, but it makes such a big difference
[1:40:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This makes me want to complete side content before starting EW
[1:40:10] <%crimsonharvest> haha i cant wait to get there and just be ignored, i never engaged with any of their stupid one-zone grinds
[1:40:10] <+Shikari21> @PatStaresAt the class doesnt have to be at cap i got unique dialogue without havning white mage past level 45
[1:40:15] <%InternetShis> NG+ is gonna be big
[1:40:22] <%zyberion626> @patstaresat you don't even need whm at cap to get that comment earlier. You just need to be a whm in canon
[1:40:26] <%UvBenServed> Doubt
[1:40:28] <%Birdigalore> I think you just need to have finished the 2.0 white mage story.  I have mine at 50 and was still acknowledged for it
[1:40:30] <@goose_attack_almanac> I dunno. Estinein is really cool
[1:40:36] <%RealThiele> hi MCH man
[1:40:52] <%InternetShis> Where you at, Monk gang
[1:40:54] <+Shikari21> @Birdigalore not even that my white mage is only 45 and i got the dialgoue as well
[1:40:59] <%AquilaHarukaze> He's gonna die
[1:41:00] <+cappyd33> they're gay dude don't
[1:41:00] <Ks201> It’s even cooler that they still acknowledge it even if your not the class that was associated with them
[1:41:01] <%RealThiele> hes the foppiest noble
[1:41:05] <+Castle_Kundarak> Sadu would KILL Emmanellain
[1:41:15] <%UvBenServed> Dude's gonna be his dick blown off
[1:41:16] <@goose_attack_almanac> Sadu *will* break him
[1:41:20] <%InternetShis> I know the Pugilist girl in green was among Lyse's potato gang
[1:41:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> I have a feeling his dancing will save the day
[1:41:29] <%RealThiele> can SAdu break me too?
[1:41:54] <+cappyd33> SHE"S SO FUCKING COOOOOL

[1:42:31] <%RealThiele> were they good?
[1:42:36] <+MelodyMedley> Bringing everyone to the end
[1:42:41] <SinisterBroccoli> Pipin the boy
[1:42:55] <%X2Eliah> In some stories, seeing this many previous characters and friends in one place would be a major red flag for impending death of all/most...

[1:43:02] <%zyberion626> LUL

[1:44:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> BARDS

[2:04:17] <%zyberion626> @havictos he's holding the fort because he rightfully fear he may exacerbate the civil war if he pops back up
[2:04:51] <+mags_alore> i had a 30 min queue for the trial last night and just went to bed, trying to get back in to do it (playing WAR) @uptonogood18
[2:04:56] <rosemon5001> he secretly went to watch the kites
[2:05:54] <+Havictos> @zyberion626 there's enough military left for a civil war? I wonder if we'll meet him there? I'm at work so I'm playing vicariously through Pat
[2:06:33] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Edible_Enthusiasm probably not, i had no issues with it last night
[2:07:11] <Blank9> I've had no real issues at all, on Lamia

[2:10:11] <+FutaSnek> She sounds just like her
[2:10:11] <Edible_Enthusiasm> they look organized
[2:10:20] <%InternetShis> Of course all the Ishgardians are out here dressed in basketball shorts in the winter
[2:10:22] <AlexDaGr8> they put their differences aside for the sake of war
[2:10:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That's a dumb statement Alphinaud just made. They think they're being invaded, why not fight back!?
[2:10:27] <TioXyco> I... thought Emmanelain would be used to the cold LUL
[2:10:47] <%justacrow84> that kid wants to kill

[2:11:24] <@QueequegTheater> Oh my god let me innnnnn
[2:11:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Ebonyglow all queues are probably bad
[2:11:31] <+Havictos> @tioxyco I think that implies Garlemald is even colder than Ishgard
[2:11:34] <TioXyco> @Ebonyglow wait... the tank queues? I thought those would be healers and dps (as usual)
[2:11:42] <%justacrow84> @ebonyglow Yeah until people finish leveling Reaper and Sage and catch up it's gonna be hard to progress
[2:11:49] <nip_nips> @QueequegTheater whats that, a 2002 you want?
[2:12:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> the others are bad for 70 and under, since new jobs dont start at cap
[2:12:13] <%InternetShis> Last night I saw SEVEN PF GROUPS all at the first trial waiting on healers
[2:12:14] <%Ebonyglow> Tank queues are good for levelling content because of reaper and sage but for new MSQ stuff not so much
[2:12:17] <@QueequegTheater> @Ebonyglow @TioXyco When I got to the first trial I had to run around multiple maps begging for healers in shout chat
[2:12:25] <%zyberion626> @queequegtheater best I can do is a 2002 at sub 200
[2:12:40] <+VoltecZero> THANCRED'S COAT

[2:13:40] <@QueequegTheater> @TioXyco Healers are getting instaqueues, they didn't bother with PF
[2:13:42] <+Aokaay> man that few healers? maybe i should offer help to people not getting healers
[2:13:47] <%crimsonharvest> i can see this requiring a manual push like in armageddon
[2:13:48] <%justacrow84> @turtlesandtentacles Garlemald
[2:13:49] <TioXyco> @QueequegTheater FUCK!
[2:13:50] <%DashXero> This sounds like a good plan.

[2:14:02] <@QueequegTheater> @Aokaay On Crystal at least
[2:14:03] <+naibobi> wait, there's a healer shortage of all things?
[2:14:12] <$realm_forge> I would love a metal gear style espionage game with fantasy elements
[2:14:23] <%crimsonharvest> Thancred looks almost like he could be wearing a WoW outfit
[2:14:24] <%InternetShis> CHAT, STRAT FOR THE TRIALS: Get a team in PF and then go into DF to get those healers
[2:14:28] <TioXyco> @QueequegTheater I HAD to choose tanking this expansion so I get used to it huh... well, I've sat on my own dick this time

[2:30:22] <$realm_forge> That dog armor could probably be pretty easy to make out of foam.....

[2:31:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Aeoneth Big agree
[2:31:57] <+dom3800> I love this battle theme
[2:32:02] <AlexDaGr8> this is some sick music
[2:32:03] <+embranz> @Aeoneth yeah but I understand why they don't
[2:32:12] <jorniev> are these guys from other quests?
[2:32:24] <%zyberion626> the cutscene after this is where I crashed twice

[2:34:09] <+PenmanLupine> @wolverinewaswrong I don't think he logged out from last night
[2:34:10] <%InternetShis> Estinien NEEDS to kill
[2:34:11] <loukemia83> Murders heal through repopulation, kinda, right?
[2:34:15] <%InternetShis> LESS THAN LETHAL
[2:34:15] <%JoshManVGH> "Stop maiming the mind controlled Einstinian"
[2:34:18] <%DashXero> I like the "enthusiastically murder" interpretation.
[2:34:22] <%zyberion626> @wolverinewaswrong  log in early
[2:34:28] <IntenseNerdRage> Estinien is a fucking idiot in doing literally anything that isnt killing
[2:34:33] <+DeRedBaron> is THIS why sleep was added to the DPS caster classes? so Y'shotla can cast it to subdue that guy xD
[2:34:33] <%JoshManVGH> OH THAT he can fuck up!
[2:34:34] <Daxalog> How do you sleep a mecha walker?
[2:34:37] <@QueequegTheater> Wait is Estinien like 35?
[2:34:38] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I guess he can scrap the mechas
[2:34:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Basically
[2:34:40] <wolverinewaswrong> @penmanlupine that's fair

[2:34:51] <artoflec> is that a fuckin JUDGE
[2:34:52] <Edible_Enthusiasm> He did become Nidhogg at one point
[2:34:53] <%JoshManVGH> If he had the Echo he would be a WoL
[2:34:53] <%InternetShis> Basically
[2:34:55] <+natjen8> not graha?
[2:34:56] <IntenseNerdRage> Estinien is ff14s Zoro
[2:34:57] <%Monkeyweed21> GUNLANCE

[2:35:03] <+LimitlessPsycho> “Keep the casualties to a minimum”
[2:35:03] <+cappyd33> right after thancred
[2:35:09] <%DashXero> Foolishness.
[2:35:11] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt At this point I think he could take Stormblood Zenos solo
[2:35:11] <+PenmanLupine> I miss Yda
[2:35:11] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I like how the reason Esti works alone isn't cause he's edgy but it's cause he's socially awkward

[3:39:19] <%TG_Cid11> @PatStaresAt It sounds like they are mad about you doing the things they did to others

[3:40:12] <%kyh9> This is literally some north korean propagando
[3:40:20] <nip_nips> heal them to full, THEN kill them
[3:40:20] <Daskolin> Ok Garle,and is pretty much America(Intelect wise)
[3:40:21] <Treasure_Vault> they're trying to steal your vital essence
[3:40:27] <@goose_attack_almanac> Do... they not know what they do in Ala Migo
[3:40:27] <%EynoStiles> You fucks destroyed your own country. we dont want your burnt shit.
[3:40:27] <jorniev> GARLEMALD WILL RISE AGAIN
[3:40:34] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Redo Of Healer these bitches
[3:40:36] <%TONYOO101> how dare you try to help us, some of us want to freeze to death while starving -that guy probably
[3:40:45] <tigerfang86> True
[3:40:46] <Eger007> they are civies
[3:40:46] <+rdark_ksu> but he had a trick up his sleeve?
[3:40:52] <@QueequegTheater> @Daskolin Eh, it's not just America. American morons are just louder
[3:40:55] <%Screwdatguy> im just glad he is not that much of a pushover
[3:40:56] <%RealThiele> he sorta hurt alphi and he beat the shit outta them
[3:40:58] <%alcors_wisdom> i mean to be fair he does look like a twink
[3:40:58] <+Krivvan> @Screwdatguy to be fair, there are irl radios that use a rock/crystal
[3:41:02] <%VictorVonLouche> Funny that Alphy is actually pretty strong
[3:41:03] <StarMechV> I'm a healer but
[3:41:03] <AlexDaGr8> he's a sage now, so at LEAST level 70
[3:41:05] <%watts121> I mean I would bet on the kid with magic funnels over these civvies
[3:41:08] <+chimaera24> They jumped him and they still lost
[3:41:13] <%UvBenServed> He has 4 laser guns. They'd need at least 2 more guys
[3:41:19] <Ahack13> The fact they even really hurt him is kinda rediculous tbh. Hes got 4 guns
[3:41:23] <%VictorVonLouche> He's got like 4 guns they had no chance
[3:41:23] <@goose_attack_almanac> Alphinaud survived Emet Selch attacks. Some starving fuck heads won't kill him
[3:41:27] <StarMechV> Call an ambulance. but not for me
[3:41:28] <AllenDeadman> he has laser guns
[3:41:32] <Notorious_Mic> He has floating guns as well
[3:41:32] <jorniev> GOOD JOB ALPHY
[3:41:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Just let them die yo lol
[3:41:42] <%Screwdatguy> @Krivvan true, but i dont think they just plugged a raw rock into some ports on the side of it
[3:41:43] <%Buttlo> It's fine to leave him with them because the absolutely worst thing that could happen is he kills them and we just learned that's acceptable.
[3:41:44] <%MrP33Ps> he has his dad's guns
[3:41:45] <%RealThiele> only reason they hurt him is cause Alphi is Alphi and he dont wanna violence
[3:41:49] <KatabolicRage> eh you gotta look at it from their side, the empire is 1000% not going to tell the civilian population anything other than "magic is evil, foreigners want to kill you" unless they join the army
[3:41:53] <@QueequegTheater> He even pulls out a gun
[3:42:09] <%RealThiele> end of that pipe is a current
[3:42:11] <@goose_attack_almanac> @KatabolicRage even then it's mostly people like Gaius doing that
[3:42:13] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Garleans are so based and redpilled
[3:42:17] <%Dakuu75> that's cool
[3:42:50] <%VictorVonLouche> @AHomeschoolDropout cause it was... by design
[3:42:51] <@QueequegTheater> How many goddamn times? If you think you're being clever, you're not, it's a spoiler.
[3:42:59] <%DashXero> Almasty look so cool.

[3:43:18] <%Screwdatguy> oh finally. I always wondered what those were
[3:43:20] <Notorious_Mic> What?
[3:43:24] <+gitgouda> well that would require people who spoil things to have a higher iq.
[3:43:26] <wolverinewaswrong> I thought you meant the future in general for a second
[3:43:29] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Pro tip, when following NPCs, lock on and auto-run, you won't outpace them
[3:43:32] <vicar_anat> even if you really really really REALLY really need to know? /s
[3:43:34] <wolverinewaswrong> like climate change or something

[3:59:06] <+cappyd33> so thancred's a honorary garlean
[3:59:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> OKAY SO THEY HAVE A MAGIC EYE THO....
[3:59:10] <nip_nips> the only magic they can cast is gun
[3:59:27] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> IIRC pureblood garleans are on average a bit physically stronger as well.
[3:59:35] <@QueequegTheater> Oh fuck, yeah no wonder they love guns
[3:59:42] <%Puhff> TITUS
[3:59:43] <%Screwdatguy> why tf do some of they even fucking hide it then? Is being seen as one in Eorzia that rare?
[3:59:45] <+abrupt_abe> That makes sense why they thought the WOL was such a freak early on, taking on garleans like nothing
[3:59:55] <@SpaceCapnCrone> yeah, pureblooded Garleans are also generally bigger and stronger than most of the other races too
[4:00:00] <+Savarro> Garleans literally built different
[4:00:01] <%king_wragles> wait if that's a third eye was does his glasses only have 2 lenses? Or did I mishear?
[4:00:02] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> and all this is because they were genetically altered by the allegans
[4:00:04] <Mildly_Eccentric> is that also why they wanted to start a race war
[4:00:06] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This stuff is also why we were NEVER going to get them as a playable race

[4:21:43] <jorniev> man FF14 might be the most worth for your buck game ever
[4:21:44] <$EsotericOdyssey> Garlecope, Garleseethe, Garlemald

[4:22:53] <%VictorVonLouche> That cant control Aether so they literally have no way else to deal with it right?
[4:22:55] <%Screwdatguy> Who would have ever thought that propaganda would have saved their lives
[4:23:00] <Edible_Enthusiasm> shelled to hell
[4:23:05] <jorniev> and are they even brainwashed?
[4:23:05] <%AHomeschoolDropout> First 15 minutes of NieR vibes
[4:23:06] <SaltyAzteca> Dead City vibes
[4:23:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> It's Detroit
[4:23:12] <%NopeBadguy> fascists are psychopaths, more at 11
[4:23:13] <%shurtal> gief will soon spin his cocoon and metamorphose into twice his current size

[4:24:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Uh oh someone put clothes on some silly string
[4:24:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Ynkubus_ I think thats the problem. There's too much shit
[4:24:12] <$EsotericOdyssey> they're just noodlemen now
[4:24:13] <%VictorVonLouche> Well they did say in 5.4 or w/e that being tempered for so long they transform.
[4:24:42] <GeltonZ> You know that kinda reminds me of FF13 and the Fal'cie and Cieth and all that.
[4:24:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea it was mentioned that once they physically change their current methods won't work
[4:24:45] <%shurtal> Time to Ride the Tube!
[4:24:52] <Skelegon> destroyed midgar vibes
[4:25:02] <%UvBenServed> Metro XIV
[4:25:04] <+athuramn> the subway terminal we all wish we could go to irl
[4:25:04] <%RealThiele> smell of piss commence
[4:25:06] <%Nekros4442> WE PLAYING METRO
[4:25:07] <@CreepyPorpoise> I really like this map, even with it being super destroyed
[4:25:07] <@SpaceCapnCrone> huh, Ceruleum sprites.
[4:25:07] <%Nekros4442> LETS GO
[4:25:10] <primarch_lupercal> ff15 insomnia
[4:25:12] <%AHomeschoolDropout> man seeing how technologically advanced the Garleans are it makes sense why they just absolutely fucked the shit out of Eorzea
[4:25:17] <+Akizea> fantasy russia
[4:25:19] <%Nekros4442> I hope the leader has a russian accent
[4:25:23] <+Aokaay> overworld themes in these areas have been super solid
[4:25:28] <+athuramn> homeless people everywhere D:
[4:25:28] <SaltyAzteca> Metro 2033 hype
[4:25:37] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt how far did you get in Guardian's of the Galaxy before FFXIV stuff?
[4:25:47] <+Akizea> heh
[4:25:57] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Like the rest of the world is like in the 16th/17th century and Garleans are out here in the fucking 22nd century
[4:26:01] <Edible_Enthusiasm> this seems kind of cozy
[4:26:38] <@QueequegTheater> @Edible_Enthusiasm It's like fifteen degrees below zero
[4:26:40] <%Aeoneth> @PatStaresAt The one thing that gets me is when the towers 1st showed up,  someone (I think Urianger) said they were distinctly Garlean in design.  But those architecture disputes that
[4:26:46] <%VictorVonLouche> Panned but no va
[4:26:48] <wolverinewaswrong> is garlemals basically Midgar?
[4:26:55] <jorniev> metro 2033
[4:27:02] <%trancecarlito> @Aeoneth urianger speak for "they look evil as shit"
[4:27:42] <nip_nips> totally not a trap
[4:27:46] <%kyh9> WHAT IF ITS VARIS
[4:28:04] <%EynoStiles> this is why i cang sympathize with the garlans. they were take over other places. did they think know one was going to fight back.
[4:28:08] <wolverinewaswrong> what if its Sora
[4:28:23] <%Dakuu75> he sounds old and wise
[4:28:26] <%watts121> :)
[4:28:38] <%Dakuu75> WHO
[4:28:47] <tigerfang86> that's a real evil beard
[4:29:03] <Solvari> This guy is as commander as one can be
[4:29:04] <@QueequegTheater> That's a fucking powerful beard holy shit
[4:29:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> He looks like Ganon
[4:29:09] <%LouieRouie> Macbeth from Gargoyles?
[4:29:35] <tigerfang86> This dude's definitely living in a society
[4:29:38] <SaltyAzteca> war, war never changes
[4:29:56] <+cappyd33> YOU TRIED TO ENSLAVE AND KILL US AS SOON AS YOU GOT MAGITEK
[4:29:56] <%AHomeschoolDropout> God I wish the Hyur just had Garlean faces and hairs
[4:29:57] <%VHGS> Yeah I'm sure there's big profit in conquering a literal pile of garbage, man.
[4:29:58] <Edible_Enthusiasm> who is occupying their homeland >:l
[4:30:09] <+OneGorillionDollars> gee I wonder if we will get to see it
[4:30:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> This whole "you people stuff" is getting old
[4:30:13] <Solvari> Maybe we will go there in the new story arc
[4:30:34] <%PatNTheHat> I think some of the books in the Great Gubal Library talks about their history
[4:30:35] <%kyh9> I WANT GARLAND TO SHOW UP
[4:30:39] <%kyh9> I WANT FF1 GARLAND TO SHOW UP
[4:30:49] <OnonokiNonon> So Garleans can only think of war, while Sharlayans can only think of not-war
[4:30:51] <AllenDeadman> yeah
[4:30:57] <AllenDeadman> they were basically kicked out
[4:30:59] <+natjen8> they're a kingdom of refugees
[4:31:06] <AllenDeadman> wander and scrounge
[4:31:07] <tigerfang86> life sucked big time shit
[4:31:08] <$StrawberryPantsu> Ain't that In the Lore book?
[4:31:08] <Solvari> Garland is in FFXIV but nothing big happens with him
[4:31:13] <%RealThiele> Fantasy mormons
[4:31:18] <%count_bob> Cool story, still brutal dictatorship.
[4:31:20] <%Screwdatguy> Wait... so are they the jewish in history? (I feel alwful asking that)
[4:31:24] <Bert_Karlsson> Worked for Israel
[4:31:26] <%PatNTheHat> I think the frozen hellhole had frozen Ceruleum to power their magitek?
[4:31:31] <%Dakuu75> lol
[4:31:37] <tigerfang86> Oof
[4:31:37] <%kyh9> We need a three state solution
[4:31:40] <tigerfang86> oof ouch
[4:31:40] <%VictorVonLouche> Garleans live really long though right?
[4:31:44] <jorniev> daaaamn
[4:31:45] <+fishmonger555> Curious, kinda like how Emet wanted to take back their world...
[4:31:46] <%Dakuu75> "WHO SAID THAT~?!"
[4:31:50] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Isn't that the exact same excuse Nazi Germany used to invade it's neighbors
[4:31:50] <AllenDeadman> scars they never let fade
[4:31:52] <jorniev> so Israel
[4:31:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> Oh. Cause I wanted to tell this dude to fuck off
[4:31:55] <%kyh9> BUT WHO ALIVE ACTUALLY REMEMBERS THAT LAND????
[4:31:55] <+natjen8> @VictorVonLouche nah they live normally from what i recall
[4:31:56] <%whyskeywolfe> (sweats in northern ireland)
[4:31:57] <+cappyd33> fantasy idf
[4:31:58] <+rdark_ksu> You took everything from us!!! I dont even know who you are.
[4:31:58] <wolverinewaswrong> So are garleans technically not human?
[4:32:00] <AllenDeadman> while the rest of the world forgot
[4:32:09] <@goose_attack_almanac> Honestly that makes it sound like the Ascians caused the struggles leading them here
[4:32:11] <SaltyAzteca> grudges suck
[4:32:13] <AlexDaGr8> "i feel sorry for you"  "i don't think about you at all"
[4:32:20] <$EsotericOdyssey> @wolverinewaswrong they are a different species
[4:32:20] <%kyh9> IF YOURE A GARLEAN AND HAVE SEEN THE ANCESTRAL HOMELAND EVER, PLEASE RAISE YOU RHAND
[4:32:25] <%Puhff> So basically Israel
[4:32:26] <$EsotericOdyssey> they can't do magic like humans/hyur
[4:32:38] <%kyh9> You shouldn't be able to complain about an ancestral homeland YOUVE NEVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE
[4:32:44] <+Havictos> @goose_attack_almanac would you be surprised?
[4:32:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Call me a child again and I'll shoot you
[4:33:12] <SaltyAzteca> gotta kill Chaos
[4:33:13] <%PatNTheHat> @wolverinewaswrong Isn't Wheelie Joe half-garlean tho? If two creatures can have a fertile child they're not different species
[4:33:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEA THE BENEFIT IS WE DON'T  ALL DIE
[4:33:17] <Solvari> man barbie
[4:33:24] <@goose_attack_almanac> nah, but honestly I don't know if I'd like htat more then them just getting their shit kicked in
[4:33:25] <%NopeBadguy> In his defense, this isn't an unreasonable assumption
[4:33:25] <AllenDeadman> yeah we're here for Zenos
[4:33:34] <Bert_Karlsson> Where is Cid in all this btw?
[4:33:44] <%Puhff> Yeah cuz everyone loves you so much now...
[4:33:49] <%EynoStiles> @patstaresat This is why we have to get rid of the dinosaurs
[4:33:49] <%NopeBadguy> At home doing technology
[4:33:49] <%Reilata> We just want to fuck up your evil tower.
[4:33:50] <nip_nips> cids off in neros private chambers
[4:33:54] <+cappyd33> arenvald's mom literally tried to tear his eye out its happening UNDER garlean rule
[4:33:56] <+GalaxyUni> Ala mighans would 100% Do that LULW
[4:33:56] <+natjen8> Quintus technically has a reasonable suspicion imo
[4:34:02] <%DashXero> Something tells me our party is neither ambassadors nor politicians. They may be talking out of their ass.
[4:34:04] <%kyh9> WHAT THE FUCK DOES GARLEMALD EVEN HAVE TO OFFER?
[4:34:05] <%PatNTheHat> I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT TO BE CLIPPED OUT OF CONTEXT
[4:34:05] <%Puhff> Like, the world thinks you're pricks
[4:34:13] <%PatNTheHat> "There are so many people... who just don't care"
[4:34:17] <%count_bob> I want them to suffer. Big ol racists.
[4:34:22] <CruxAustralis> fuck that we have magic
[4:34:25] <%VictorVonLouche> And super fuel
[4:34:27] <CruxAustralis> I want them to rot
[4:34:28] <Solvari> a wasteland of a country LUL
[4:34:30] <%kyh9> I don't think anybody cares about that outside of Garlemald tho?
[4:34:31] <@goose_attack_almanac> They killed a space dragon by circumstance.
[4:34:32] <+fishmonger555> Garlemald has an amazing fashion sense
[4:34:40] <CruxAustralis> we can take the fuel without them chat
[4:34:41] <+cappyd33> emet selch's engineering degree thats what  garlemald has
[4:34:49] <Solvari> they have good beards
[4:34:50] <%InternetShis> An M1A2 Abrams vs a thatch hut
[4:34:54] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt After the Weapon storyline, 200 years in the future seems like an underestimate
[4:34:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Like the losing side is turning their nose at an offer of peace smh
[4:34:56] <%kyh9> I think Eorzea and the East literally just want Garlemald to stay away from everyone else
[4:34:57] <+natjen8> a shit ton of ceruleum too from what i recall
[4:34:59] <%solracc25> bro the world is ending, just help
[4:34:59] <%DashXero> Don't trust them, dude. They're just gonna put your country into debt.
[4:35:01] <+OneGorillionDollars> NOT THIS SHIT AGAIN
[4:35:03] <+natjen8> so that they can actually fuel all their machines
[4:35:04] <+cappyd33> BECAUSE IT WAS MADE BY A FASCIST
[4:35:04] <%Arsenic_8> cause you murdered everyone and enslave people
[4:35:05] <vicar_anat> OWNED
[4:35:06] <%kyh9> WHY DONT YOU JUST LET US CONQUER YOU????
[4:35:07] <tigerfang86> u h
[4:35:07] <jorniev> garleans don't understand idealism just cold heart pragmatism
[4:35:07] <+fishmonger555> God he pisses me off
[4:35:08] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I MEAN THEY HAVE FUCKING CARS
[4:35:09] <%MidnightBurst12> D:
[4:35:11] <KatabolicRage> To be fair, while the ilsabard contingent are here with noble goals, it sounds ridiculously naive to hear it said outloud
[4:35:15] <%Buttlo> If you want peace why didn't you let us murder the shit out of you and war crime you to death
[4:35:15] <%Puhff> UNITY lul
[4:35:18] <%Puhff> LUL
[4:35:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NO IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ENSLAVE EVERYONE
[4:35:20] <+Cybercobra2> its becouse you massivly opress everyone???
[4:35:22] <@QueequegTheater> Because the Emperor wanted to commit 7 more genocides
[4:35:22] <AlexDaGr8> YOU TRIED TO KILL US
[4:35:23] <%kyh9> WHY DONT YOU JUST LET US BEAT YOU UP AND SUBJUGATE YOU???
[4:35:24] <AllenDeadman> because there was no peace? because it was a lie?
[4:35:24] <%Reilata> The whole 'not wanting to be conquered by someone' thing.
[4:35:24] <Treasure_Vault> is it the facism?
[4:35:25] <%PatNTheHat> No, it's because you're FUCKING PRICKS
[4:35:26] <jorniev> no
[4:35:29] <Voidvas> How come you dont let the Nazis just win Dummy
[4:35:31] <AllenDeadman> BECAUSE IT WAS A LITERAL LIE?
[4:35:32] <snowmanse> I think the rape camps in ala mhigo are why we fight
[4:35:32] <%walternatorz> this guy drank the varis juice
[4:35:35] <%NopeBadguy> BRO HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT IMPERIAL RULE HAS DONE TO ALA MHIGO, DOMA, BOZJA, AND WERLYT
[4:35:37] <%kyh9> WHY DONT YOU LET US ESTABLISH A RACE HIERARCHY?  DO YOU LOVE WAR OR SOMETHING?????
[4:35:46] <%PatNTheHat> He has been severely propogandized
[4:35:50] <Solvari> War is my vocabulary
[4:35:50] <%zyberion626> We want to treat you as equals. You want to SUBJUGATE everyone
[4:35:51] <%count_bob> Bye then.
[4:35:52] <%kyh9> WHY ARE YOU MAKING US GO TO WAR WITH YOU????
[4:35:53] <@goose_attack_almanac> He was Varis' boy and Varis was ALL ABOUT THE EMPIRE
[4:35:53] <+fishmonger555> He got a nice beard tho
[4:35:55] <%kyh9> LMAO
[4:35:59] <+natjen8> he is very much a boomer
[4:36:00] <%VictorVonLouche> Part of the FIRST legion too Varius' right hand man practically

[4:39:45] <%NopeBadguy> Pat, don't forget that fascism relies on heavy propaganda
[4:39:46] <tigerfang86> lol
[4:39:46] <%Buttlo> 5G propaganda
[4:39:52] <%PatNTheHat> It's like that comic where you see SUperman through Luthor's eyes and he looks really scary
[4:39:55] <%furiousfurioso> the propoganda machine before all this went down must have been WILD
[4:39:55] <+cappyd33> talk to octavia
[4:40:04] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Emet being a sassy bitch
[4:40:04] <AllenDeadman> we have literally killed gods

[4:40:15] <%EynoStiles> its so infuriating. they started the fight, and now are mad cause they lose.
[4:40:15] <+REDtheBEAST> LUL
[4:40:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Local16 lmao
[4:40:37] <@goose_attack_almanac> Probably good to not mention that their current society is a sham
[4:40:38] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:40:40] <GeltonZ> Man this is gonna be hilarious when I do it with a bunnygirl dancer in club clothes.
[4:40:41] <%PatNTheHat> Someone is writing fan fiction about this part RIGHT NOW
[4:40:43] <%JohnAtDawn> @NopeBadguy Yeah but past a certain point you have to blame people for believing the progaganda. That's why the Numenburg trials happened
[4:40:45] <%Dakuu75> wait, ppl are getting different dialogue from each other? how?
[4:40:51] <%MidnightBurst12> wow rude
[4:40:57] <%NopeBadguy> @JohnAtDawn Oh ABSOLUTELY
[4:41:15] <%NopeBadguy> @JohnAtDawn Believing in evil, even if you think it's good, is still evil
[4:41:44] <%AHomeschoolDropout> You know actually being in Garlemald, it makes sense why they think everyone else are barbarians
[4:42:10] <+rdark_ksu> ok so are they going for a high of roman tyranny thing here for Garlean?
[4:42:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Lol at the 3 warrior aura

[4:43:45] <+RTBexe> Canonically boding them
[4:43:46] <+aphotophilic> such devastation
[4:43:46] <stormhawk9891> They were WEAK SHIT
[4:43:46] <%VictorVonLouche> Awkward
[4:43:46] <CruxAustralis> they didn't even give me a fight
[4:43:47] <Skelegon> SUCH DEVASTATION
[4:43:51] <ricotez> you killed them all except those two groups that you ran past to get to the teleporters faster
[4:43:51] <%AHomeschoolDropout> If druckman directed this that NPC would've killed Alisaie and Alphie then you'd play as her
[4:43:52] <%Nekros4442> Bitch you were part of an invading force
[4:43:53] <$EsotericOdyssey> you went sicko mode in Prae
[4:43:54] <%SveriSageAdvice> we regularly murder them on a daily basis
[4:43:55] <@QueequegTheater> "I saw you kill a hundred of my friends in literally one minute, please go away"
[4:43:55] <StarMechV> SUCH DEVASTATION IT WAS NOT MY INENTION THI
[4:43:56] <%kyh9> We're not just baddies.  We're the bad assies
[4:43:56] <%Ynkubus_> Excuse me, Laha did most of that
[4:43:56] <$EsotericOdyssey> she's got a point
[4:43:57] <%NopeBadguy> "YEAH I KILLED YOUR FASCIST FUCKS AND I'D DO IT AGAIN"
[4:43:57] <CruxAustralis> they should be ashamed of themselves
[4:43:57] <wolverinewaswrong> @nebula_lp nahhhh
[4:43:58] <AllenDeadman> about that
[4:44:00] <Zebroneath> over and over and over again
[4:44:00] <+tetraes> why is garlean music so depressing
[4:44:01] <%Tearonex> you can understand why she's bitter LUL
[4:44:01] <%kyh9> Bad Ascians
[4:44:04] <%Dregon_Azure> such devastation was not your intention pat
[4:44:06] <+Diz001> Most of the time we just ran past them.
[4:44:09] <AllenDeadman> I mean
[4:44:10] <+polothegreatest> humans trying to kill a god LUL
[4:44:16] <AllenDeadman> they were also swinging
[4:44:23] <Ahack13> finally someone with a legit reason to hate your ass
[4:44:27] <%kyh9> @tetraes Look at where they live and then ask that again.  Russian music isn't exactly happy either
[4:44:47] <+Havictos> @patstaresat oh my god she's one of the soldiers we sprint past and don't even fight!
[4:44:54] <AllenDeadman> mhm?
[4:45:04] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Lady have you been to the Praetorium lately
[4:45:06] <@SpaceCapnCrone> This really throws into stark contrast what an anomaly Gaius was as a Legatus.
[4:45:08] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I run past all you guys
[4:45:10] <%kyh9> It's an interesting way that it's also understood WAY differently
[4:45:11] <jorniev> ASK THEM ABOUT THE BLAVK MIST THEY USED
[4:45:20] <%NopeBadguy> I love the venom that just comes with the word "murderer"
[4:45:22] <+Akizea> god man this zone is SO good
[4:45:39] <%KineticZen> It sure is lit in here, fam
[4:45:48] <%VictorVonLouche> oh too much good writing
[4:45:53] <tigerfang86> well yeah
[4:45:55] <Solvari> just inner release
[4:45:57] <%NopeBadguy> No, but they can stop Alphinaud and Alisaie
[4:46:05] <+polothegreatest> suplex that train
[4:46:05] <%NopeBadguy> That's why they have hostages, Pat
[4:46:08] <%Buttlo> They could hit you with the train and need to build a new train.
[4:46:13] <%solracc25> wait for this place to be full of FF 15 car mounts all over the place
[4:46:16] <%Nekros4442> most of them are half dead already
[4:46:19] <Bert_Karlsson> "Your numbers only make my bloodwhetting better fools!"
[4:46:23] <+Cybercobra2> oh they know fully well they cant stop you, but they can stop the twins
[4:46:34] <@QueequegTheater> Use Cure 2
[4:46:48] <%PatNTheHat> You helped Flava Flavius
[4:47:00] <%NopeBadguy> cough cough covid deniers cough cough
[4:47:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> FeelsBadMan
[4:47:01] <tigerfang86> they're still like people, they're just wrong
[4:47:09] <+cappyd33> allegory of the cave
[4:47:11] <+Rhaaska> gee that sounds awfully familiar
[4:47:11] <jorniev> yup
[4:47:13] <%Birdigalore> sounds familiar...
[4:47:14] <@QueequegTheater> People don't actively want to be evil
[4:47:22] <%shurtal> anything can be justified if you delude yourself enough
[4:47:27] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Imagine if US or any other western nation were to liberate North Korea or China right now and see how the populace reacts. That's kinda what Garlemald is like
[4:47:39] <%Nekros4442> @QueequegTheater I dunno, I tihnk Lahabread enjoyed it alot lol
[4:47:42] <$realm_forge> As a US citizen that is very real
[4:47:43] <+Rhaaska> yep
[4:47:52] <%cvp5127> or they want attention
[4:47:56] <@goose_attack_almanac> except for those people without kids
[4:47:57] <ExpressNode> Neurodivergent?
[4:47:57] <Druss_M> Learning Disability
[4:47:59] <+Rhaaska> autism has a weird classification
[4:48:01] <+polothegreatest> its "third partys" fault not me
[4:48:07] <%Gogogolem> Some of them
[4:48:09] <+Havictos> The Nazis certainly didn't think they were evil
[4:48:10] <@QueequegTheater> @PenmanLupine No it doesn't
[4:48:11] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt People want something to blame so that way it doesn't feel like bad shit happens at random
[4:48:14] <tigerfang86> they're just, incorrect
[4:48:15] <%Gogogolem> others just refuse to take any form of blame.
[4:48:15] <%PatNTheHat> Learning and Cognitive disability I believe, don't have my DSM in front of me
[4:48:16] <Bert_Karlsson> Stupid, or making money off people that are scared/stupid
[4:48:20] <+RandyFistburgers> And people refuse to believe they could be the stupid one
[4:48:21] <%sleepystardewfarmer> developmental disorder
[4:48:21] <%valriot> Joe vas Bidenus wont give me now aether vaccine
[4:48:25] <AllenDeadman> incredibly stupid
[4:48:25] <BobPager> I mean it also speaks to the extent to which neurodivergence itself is stigmatised
[4:48:29] <tigerfang86> there are many many levels of how incorrect you can be
[4:48:29] <%solracc25> misinformed pat
[4:48:32] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> But then it leads to "I'd rather my child be dead than have Autism"
[4:48:36] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> You're kid genes suck, thats all and thats okay, better luck next time
[4:48:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PenmanLupine You're talking to a Republican
[4:48:46] <%TheAntiNihilist> But what if they were right tho?
[4:48:51] <Saltmeisterr> YO THERES AN OSMA MOUNT?
[4:48:52] <%kyh9> Or even worse "My genes suck"
[4:48:53] <%AHomeschoolDropout> because realizing you have almost no control in  your life is scary
[4:49:04] <%VictorVonLouche> Well Parents refuse to accept blame for bad parenting lol
[4:49:05] <+Ririten> @PatStaresAt My sister became an anti vaxxer when her two kids both had autism. She decided the vaccines musta done it.
[4:49:05] <BobPager> Also I guess it reflects the ways in which disability is medicalised at large
[4:49:07] <wolverinewaswrong> honestly not having a reason feels scarier sometimes
[4:49:08] <%Delenay> my mom knows someone like this exactly
[4:49:08] <%RealThiele> people forget child mortality used to be REALLY high
[4:49:10] <Solvari> hard to avoid in these times LUL
[4:49:11] <lostvayne91> whats right is always your tribe.
[4:49:12] <+Kyma1020> The truth is it's no one's fault
[4:49:13] <AlexDaGr8> science is only really NOW getting into what causes autism in the womb, allegedly BPA content in food might be related
[4:49:13] <%baphometseinfeld> It's like how parents having an ADHD child used to deflect it because they thought they "raised their child wrong"
[4:49:14] <%kyh9> "My genes suck" is the one I think most parents I know get nervous about the most
[4:49:14] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Life sucks and its okay
[4:49:15] <%SveriSageAdvice> FFXIV gets super real on a regular basis
[4:49:16] <%Screwdatguy> Your a multifaceted streamer
[4:49:18] <%kyh9> Because there's no fixing it
[4:49:18] <%king_wragles> Gonna be honest, I really like the spontaneous real talk
[4:49:19] <%R3Roundabout> "It can't be our fault, let's blame doctors!"
[4:49:23] <%Dakuu75> w-woo... final fantasy...
[4:49:25] <AllenDeadman> me neither
[4:49:31] <+Nahual_Amini> It's interesting when you talk about that kind of stuff
[4:49:37] <moonmintparadise> I am sure it is not that hard to follow a lead when so many people are claiming the same thing over and over and over
[4:49:46] <%Delenay> its why i believe in chaos. you cant control it, its random, theres nothing you can do sometimes. no one to blame sometimes
[4:49:47] <+Havictos> @saltmeisterr gotta go through Eureka to get it though
[4:49:48] <AllenDeadman> you are idiots and dying
[4:49:54] <%Delenay> no reason to stress
[4:50:04] <%Dakuu75> uh oh...
[4:50:04] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> who?
[4:50:15] <%Nekros4442> stolen by who
[4:50:17] <ExpressNode> Both?
[4:50:18] <StarMechV> question: can you disable music for your other mounts? I wanna hear Endwalker cool tunes but also wanna ride it around on my cool car
[4:50:21] <@QueequegTheater> He directly called me evil
[4:50:22] <%justcallmebobplease> Something something, 'All republicans are evil' is what it looked like in passing.
[4:50:25] <@QueequegTheater> And then doubled down
[4:50:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh Jesus
[4:50:38] <%Puhff> lolwut
[4:50:44] <%RealThiele> triple down banned guy
[4:50:46] <AllenDeadman> ???

[4:53:24] <Zourath> Zenos would really just wipe them all out singlehandedly. Probably while asleep.

[4:53:43] <ExpressNode> Photons make for great lubricant
[4:53:45] <%Delenay> they just happen to find a large supply "abandoned"
[4:53:57] <@SpaceCapnCrone> They're really proud about huddling in a subway station like rats
[4:53:59] <+BIumen> we will actively hurt ourselves before we accept help, just to own you
[4:54:01] <%Tearonex> But we can just fucking help you man! LUL

[5:31:23] <+fetrigon> that elephant is the endwalker. watch out
[5:31:35] <nip_nips> the garleans do something like that? noooooo
[5:31:36] <2Sam4Hall> @SaltyAzteca Strangely that has the same meaning as the actual translation
[5:31:44] <GeltonZ> ...you know..."Bird Up" would actually be a good thing to shout to a Chocobo Rider Battalion. Like "get on your chocobo".
[5:31:51] <+fetrigon> cross his path and you will soon meet your end monkaS
[5:31:55] <GeltonZ> "ALLRIGHT MEN! BIRD UP!"

[5:50:31] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt He was practicing his new machinist skill
[5:50:32] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Heal him real good
[5:50:38] <@goose_attack_almanac> @niffinbox its fine  that would have usually been right
[5:50:39] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt There's a cutscene warning after you finish these objectives, just a heads up. Might be a good time to end the stream after the cutscenes
[5:50:41] <MaybeFalco> @niffinbox balls exposed
[5:50:46] <+FutaSnek> LUL res him
[5:50:48] <%THATGUY_789> just use revive
[5:51:01] <@goose_attack_almanac> raise is non-canon isn't it
[5:51:03] <%solracc25> Use phoenix Down
[5:51:08] <%EynoStiles> you never he could have alec baldwin himself?
[5:51:09] <+Havictos> @patstaresat I mean he wasn't going to play ball so it works out for us
[5:51:11] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt After you get to the end of this particular questline
[5:51:13] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Aw.
[5:51:15] <jorniev> CAN'T DEAL with the shame of losing so he fucking left his people without leadership what a bitch
[5:51:17] <umbraawitch> use a phoenix down on aerith 4Head
[5:51:18] <KaironFortressKnight> Just rub a phoenix down on his bullet hole
[5:51:21] <+Havictos> we're guilt free
[5:51:21] <%MaritimeFox> too soon
[5:51:22] <+Diz001> Hit it like that bullet hit the back of that dudes skull.
[5:51:23] <+Rigid_Iguana> will a phoenix down work
[5:51:29] <GeltonZ> Considering the twists this game pulls, I'd normally agree we needed a noise. But that splatter was smooth.
[5:51:31] <umbraawitch> @jorniev what a baby
[5:51:38] <+the22cstomp> how do people not know that phoenix downs and raises only affect people who are knocked out, not killed, that's been explained forever jesus
[5:51:38] <%EynoStiles> @rigid_iguana it should lol

[5:52:14] <rosabellamelantha> I literally stopped at that cutscene bit today, I legit cannot believe this is only 1 third of the game (I think)?
[5:52:15] <@Spydurman> it's actually just paint he's faking it for the camera Kappa
[5:52:16] <%EynoStiles> @the22cstomp because its funny
[5:52:29] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Compare Quintus and Gaius, one killed himself rather than endure the shame of surrender, and the other miserably clawed his way out of the ruins and discarded his pride to avenge his men.
[5:52:30] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Only thing that sucks about the bunnybois is that you can't wear cool hats
[5:52:36] <%Backfire_Shot> Backfire_Shot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! Howdy pat I have realized the shape and extent of my own insanity for unique items in games. If it can be obtained and has stats I NEED to have it, if I cant I cannot play the game. If you want an example look up Oni-Goroshi in poe im grinding for it now.

[5:59:04] <Frostydough1> dude it literally feels like that man
[5:59:06] <Treasure_Vault> i'd say surprise, but
[5:59:06] <Tracazoid> Apparently
[5:59:06] <SinisterBroccoli> You can't get rich without being evil
[5:59:06] <%RealThiele> yes
[5:59:07] <%NopeBadguy> Yes
[5:59:07] <SaltyAzteca> ITS A CABAL
[5:59:07] <Solvari> Yes, it's a trait passively acquired
[5:59:08] <jorniev> YES
[5:59:08] <+cappyd33> yeah basically
[5:59:09] <cartakus> "Hey woolie whats new in the news"
[5:59:09] <KitsuneManami> "Senior VP of PSN allegedly tried to meet 15 year old for sex. "
[5:59:10] <$StrawberryPantsu> All Billionaires Are Pedos
[5:59:10] <JobbedBone> umm
[5:59:10] <%MaritimeFox> ANother one?
[5:59:12] <Frostydough1> like what the actual fuck
[5:59:12] <FirewallStorm> yes
[5:59:12] <$EsotericOdyssey> legit having a bunch of money does fuck with your brain
[5:59:13] <$StrawberryPantsu> ABAP
[5:59:14] <livi242> more money means less consequences
[5:59:14] <%THATGUY_789> sorry
[5:59:15] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> And I just bought a PS5 vividNuke
[5:59:15] <ohno778> I just assume being rich makes you a pedo
[5:59:16] <%Reilata> Having lots of money makes rules and morals optional.
[5:59:17] <Druss_M> Yeah Senior Vice president of PSN
[5:59:18] <%RealThiele> Slannesh cult shit
[5:59:18] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> What do you mean again do
[5:59:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> guess money just makes all morality get tossed out the window??
[5:59:18] <jorniev> BOREDOM PROBABLY
[5:59:20] <rosabellamelantha> No having a million dollars means you have no consequences so kidfuckers can do it freely
[5:59:21] <cartakus> FUCKING DARK ELDAR
[5:59:22] <ChungusQuest> Other way around, probably. Power-tripping psychopaths are the best-suited to becoming millionaires
[5:59:23] <%Delenay> they got the money so they cooould do it
[5:59:23] <%emperordread> It's a debuff when you hit $1m
[5:59:24] <youngin_______420> Demons
[5:59:25] <%EynoStiles> george cacioppo!
[5:59:26] <heartlesshealer> they think the money will let them get away with it
[5:59:26] <+lemon_lore> well they love f young ppl for sure
[5:59:29] <+rdark_ksu> They get desenstitized and need crazy freaky immoral shit. I assume anyway
[5:59:30] <%Aeoneth> Wasn't there a study done that excess weath begins to distort peoples personalities
[5:59:34] <xxshadowxx416> does Rick = into children
[5:59:37] <%MaritimeFox> Someone should check these rich people. I don't think they're healthy.
[5:59:45] <@goose_attack_almanac> It's like these fuckers think "When you have enough money to get what you want you start wanting things you can't get?"
[5:59:49] <%kyh9> Pedophiles seek out jobs they can get away with kid fucking I
[5:59:53] <%THATGUY_789> um its for the players
[5:59:55] <%MaritimeFox> Eyes Wide Shut stuff
[5:59:57] <@Spydurman> @PatStaresAt found it on twitter and DM'ed you for when you wanna look later
[6:00:01] <neraren> Please do not cast them as the victims of wealth
[6:00:06] <neraren> sickos are sickos
[6:00:09] <%kyh9> Power attracts those only those deranged enough to see use of it
[6:00:11] <cartakus> Just gamer stuff
[6:00:12] <heartlesshealer> @goose_attack_almanac that sounds about right
[6:00:14] <moonmintparadise> everyone is gathered there to poke at the corpse
[6:00:14] <%justcallmebobplease> Russian translation, but looks like a pedo hunting ring found him, that's the skinny?
[6:00:20] <ohno778> sir you can't ride you chocobo on the train...
[6:00:23] <umbraawitch> @Aeoneth wouldnt be surprised
[6:00:25] <$realm_forge> Being that rich makes you so dead inside that they start pursuing more and more extreme versions of excess I guess?
[6:00:27] <%NopeBadguy> I think it's pronounced "See-so"
[6:00:33] <%NopeBadguy> or "Kai-so"
[6:00:35] <%NopeBadguy> Like kaiser
[6:00:42] <ohno778> QUESO
[6:00:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> What happened? I stepped away for a second
[6:00:46] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Not in game
[6:00:49] <cartakus> Like eldar into dark eldar
[6:00:54] <xxshadowxx416> Sony ceo hey kid do you want a Playstation 5
[6:00:56] <neraren> Being rich doesnt put the sickness in you, it gives you the means to express whats already there
[6:00:57] <@Spydurman> @SuckerPunchSyd PSN VP is a pedo
[6:01:07] <%justcallmebobplease> Ah, video of him with a 15 y/o boy is being touted for George Cacioppo.

[6:02:29] <%MaritimeFox> Goodness knows what all the twins are dealing with in their minds.
[6:02:31] <cartakus> Whats better a racist leader offing himself or getting shot in the back of the head by under command?
[6:02:41] <%NopeBadguy> Ask the other baby behind you
[6:02:42] <Solvari> Gief more cookie

[6:02:48] <AlexDaGr8> stair ghost
[6:02:51] <%MaritimeFox> For the world? Not sure it matters.
[6:02:53] <%ElkRiverDog> Seriously, Alphanaud and Alisae need to have a growth spurt in the next expansion

[6:06:00] <Solvari> Ifrit cant even hit that enemy
[6:06:02] <otakon17> When mooks can beat up legendary summons
[6:06:02] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Trails in the Sky made it to where characters lvl are approximate to their cutscene strength
[6:06:10] <heartlesshealer> mechanically, yes
[6:06:11] <%PayCreeps_> but ifrit would win couse of tempering
[6:06:14] <+Dunsparcetheglare> wouldn't the indoctrination aura or something stop it
[6:06:14] <%Rigid_Iguana> loch leech wouldnt kill nails
[6:06:15] <@goose_attack_almanac> Maybe the people who summoned it should have power-levelled.
[6:06:16] <+fetrigon> ye fuck levels
[6:06:16] <Profmcstevie> At those levels sure, but I assume summons are at their peak in universe
[6:06:17] <%RealThiele> imgaine using levels literally
[6:06:18] <Ids560> the loch leech wouldn't know to kill the nail so Ifrit wins Kappa
[6:06:19] <%MaritimeFox> That's a funny image
[6:06:23] <Frostydough1> that loch could even kill Extreme Ifirit
[6:06:23] <tanarath> level is meaningless
[6:06:24] <%PatNTheHat> But could it learn the mechanics? Would the leech kill the nails?
[6:06:26] <otakon17> COMMENCE DA WALLOPIN!
[6:06:29] <AlexDaGr8> depends on how much crystal juice ifrit has apparently
[6:06:30] <%THATGUY_789> story lvl i guess
[6:06:32] <MKII> but is a leech smart enough to click unsync party
[6:06:34] <thecrazyestminer> I experienced the data center dc while in que today man I hate it
[6:06:41] <17sevens> isn't the canon thinking that levels are just game balance and actual strength is something else?
[6:06:45] <%Screwdatguy> Ya but can ifrit suck my nuts?
[6:07:05] <%Rigid_Iguana> that deer could probably unsync thordan
[6:07:12] <heartlesshealer> a lot of people hope so
[6:07:15] <@Spydurman> could that deer have beat Ifrit?
[6:07:18] <@Spydurman> no
[6:07:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> not yet
[6:07:18] <otakon17> CARS?!
[6:07:19] <%Delenay> nope
[6:07:21] <Druss_M> no
[6:07:21] <SinisterBroccoli> THE echo?
[6:07:22] <%KineticZen> Not really
[6:07:23] <%Reilata> I didn't really notice.
[6:07:24] <%Screwdatguy> Uhhh not yet
[6:07:24] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @screwdatguy do you really want roasted nuts
[6:07:25] <%Animatic_> nah
[6:07:26] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat that cutscene bit I told you about is very long and throws you into a gameplay section you can't back out from to do other things. It's really cool though, but you won't end the stream until after 8
[6:07:26] <Ids560> I mean the level 22 Ifrit is canonically weaker than the level 50 one you fight later
[6:07:27] <Solvari> all good
[6:07:28] <+Aokaay> nope
[6:07:29] <heartlesshealer> ???
[6:07:30] <moonmintparadise> that is just straight up a car
[6:07:31] <moonmintparadise> nah
[6:07:33] <Frostydough1> sound good, good job mr streamer
[6:07:34] <cartakus> Don't hear echo
[6:07:34] <otakon17> I hear a barking pupper
[6:07:36] <moonmintparadise> we are good, captain
[6:07:38] <heartlesshealer> good sound
[6:07:41] <heartlesshealer> bork
[6:07:47] <niffinbox> all good!
[6:07:52] <%Puhff> STRONG AND LOUD
[6:07:52] <%Baby_Hotpockets_> Nope, it’s all good
[6:08:02] <%NopeBadguy> all good
[6:08:06] <%Delenay> my cat is doing that kind of shit right now
[6:08:08] <+Freakin_Wolfy> You can play this game with a CONTROLLER???
[6:08:11] <thecrazyestminer> @patstaresat your dog can break those cuffes
[6:08:11] <%shurtal> time for pat to GRIND an edgelord
[6:08:15] <%Birdigalore> Oh yeah you can definitely get the first trial tonight
[6:08:17] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt There is a FAT leave button after like 20 minutes of cutscenes but then you'll have to skip all the cutscenes again and it'll be kinda jarring
[6:08:23] <+fetrigon> LUL
[6:08:23] <%Dakuu75> WHO SAID THAT
[6:08:29] <%Dakuu75> HOLY SHIT
[6:08:36] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[6:08:39] <heartlesshealer> EYELESS
[6:08:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> this game is on PS$
[6:08:46] <arkv01> why yes deez nuts are huge
[6:08:46] <%RealThiele> play the game my way idiot
[6:08:47] <%PatNTheHat> @PatStaresAt Have you had any audio issues? I managed to run a dungeon last night and my combat sounds were .... wavy? Dunno if I need to reinstall
[6:08:48] <niffinbox> controller is the best way
[6:08:51] <%Axellogic> controller support very goo
[6:08:53] <+Ironbuttz> has Gief always been a noisy boy?  Mine is 8 months old now and hardly makes a peep
[6:08:56] <otakon17> urge to play ...rising!
[6:08:59] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Oh scratch that there is a LEAVE button before you do the gameplay section so you're good, it's just a long cutscene
[6:09:00] <GeltonZ> My only beef with the controller is targetting. I think I might be doing something wrong.
[6:09:02] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Some WFR clears are console players
[6:09:04] <%Puhff> cross hotbar gang gang
[6:09:07] <cartakus> Zangief makes me think of that dog that jumped from the top of the stairs like it though it could fly
[6:09:07] <+Isoterica> clicking on quest givers way easier with controller
[6:09:08] <otakon17> Gief got noisy after getting BEEF
[6:09:08] <thecrazyestminer> I play this game on console
[6:09:13] <%lucky_icarus> Im paying on ps4 rIGht NOW
[6:09:17] <tanarath> ff14 is designed for both
[6:09:19] <%RealThiele> its controller support is immaculate i was shocked coming from wow and other mmos
[6:09:19] <%lucky_icarus> playing*
[6:09:28] <+Ironbuttz> he's a lab/coonhound mix
[6:09:33] <otakon17> chonkster
[6:09:37] <otakon17> oh lord
[6:09:42] <otakon17> he's gonna get VERY noisy
[6:09:43] <Profmcstevie> Gief personality is loud and rambunctious
[6:09:43] <cartakus> Coomhound?
[6:09:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They are giant babies
[6:09:49] <otakon17> >coonhound not vocal
[6:09:51] <niffinbox> the fact it supported controller is what got me into it and then other mmos
[6:09:53] <otakon17> you kiddin' right?
[6:09:54] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Well, shit. Now I have to start playing. Fuck me
[6:09:54] <heartlesshealer> they get noisier when they grow up and learn how to get you to do things
[6:10:03] <otakon17> labs it depends
[6:10:06] <@CreepyPorpoise> LOCAL COOMHOUNDS NEAR U
[6:10:11] <otakon17> coonhounds are KNOWN for their vocality
[6:10:11] <+Ironbuttz> interesting
[6:10:20] <%Rigid_Iguana> coon hounds tree were meant to tree coons. they do that by barking loud as fuck
[6:10:22] <+Havictos> wouldn't that scare off said racoons?
[6:10:36] <@PeachSaliva> Sorry, is Gief being too loud?
[6:10:37] <%THATGUY_789> huskies on the otherhand will sing you their peoples song
[6:10:38] <avacer> This music is chill af.
[6:10:39] <+Ironbuttz> I just wanna hear my boi SPEAK
[6:10:42] <+Havictos> oh there's my answer
[6:10:43] <heartlesshealer> porpoise no LUL
[6:10:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @creepyporpoise did you manage to get in at all?
[6:10:51] <otakon17> wait till Zangief chews through the door one of these days
[6:10:53] <@CreepyPorpoise> I did actually
[6:10:56] <@CreepyPorpoise> like just a couple minutes ago
[6:10:57] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Also he seems fine
[6:11:00] <@PeachSaliva> @otakon17 I would cry
[6:11:00] <otakon17> man that music is nice
[6:11:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> PogChamp nice!!!
[6:11:10] <@CreepyPorpoise> \o/

[6:11:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I am. Still gettting 2002 errors

[6:11:19] <ytwitchmeng> You
[6:11:22] <@CreepyPorpoise> Its really fucking rough, good luck Syd

[6:11:26] <%Puhff> FeelsBadMan
[6:11:26] <%MaritimeFox> Zangief was just gonna take a gap year, Pat
[6:11:27] <+Havictos> who can say
[6:11:28] <otakon17> @PeachSaliva careful he'll do it too, pits/bulldogs will do that if they get antsy enough
[6:11:28] <tanarath> @peachsaliva We love him.
[6:11:34] <cartakus> Elmo's fault
[6:11:34] <Sunstalker> We're all looking for who did this
[6:11:35] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[6:11:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ty, I’m gonna try late tonight
[6:11:48] <%PatNTheHat> @Puhff Nice. 5.5K on Jenova. feelsbadman
[6:11:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Godspeed o7
[6:11:48] <Profmcstevie> The guiltiest orb
[6:12:01] <otakon17> but can you ponder it?
[6:12:02] <ytwitchmeng> Anyways...What would your own FF game be called if you made one?
[6:12:16] <tigerfang86> Probably option 2
[6:12:18] <%JohnAtDawn> COWARD
[6:12:18] <%THATGUY_789> like father like son
[6:12:24] <Demonkyo21> wiped on login queue: ultimate
[6:12:31] <Demonkyo21> That aoe is a helluva thing
[6:12:31] <tigerfang86> big coward energy
[6:12:54] <niffinbox> he logged himself out of the world
[6:12:55] <cartakus> THE BIGGEST "YOU DID NOT WIN"
[6:13:00] <Zebroneath> Next thing will be about an hour
[6:13:02] <%solracc25> Random robot flies around
[6:13:08] <%PatNTheHat> @Demonkyo21 The tankbuster "2002 disconnect" goes through mitigation, FYI
[6:13:28] <otakon17> n this stream, Zangief yells at Peach
[6:13:28] <engineboi> Why does twitch have warped audio?
[6:13:31] <%theghostofhype> theghostofhype subscribed with Prime. 
[6:13:41] <otakon17> audio seems fine on my end
[6:13:45] <Daxalog> Did Paige get a sponsor deal for Century Age of Ashes?
[6:13:47] <%PatNTheHat> @engineboi It's a twitch problem, just reload the page
[6:13:50] <otakon17> have you checked your speakers?
[6:13:53] <+fetrigon> pat, is zangief the endwalker?
[6:13:53] <otakon17> they may be dying on you
[6:13:59] <neraren> Am I the weirdo for grabbing all the quests at once? Running past them is triggering some weird feelings
[6:14:04] <Demonkyo21> @Demonkyo21 Damn. Good to know. I'll not waste my bubble
[6:14:10] <+SkreamnRedSkull> I'm hear to play FF14 vicariously through @PatStaresAt because I'm put off from MMO culture :D
[6:14:12] <SaltyAzteca> press play button, off and on
[6:14:15] <KatabolicRage> a lot of people save sidequests for other classes
[6:14:17] <+DeRedBaron> yeah although the ufnny thing is i get a desync
[6:14:17] <%baka_sugoi> SMOL DOG
[6:14:18] <otakon17> @neraren that's just mind goblins at work
[6:14:18] <%Rigid_Iguana> its my turn to play but I keep getting 2002d
[6:14:19] <Profmcstevie> flick low latency on and off, avoid ads restarting that way
[6:14:21] <%Puhff> always turn off Low Latency mode
[6:14:22] <+DeRedBaron> which is solved the same way
[6:14:22] <@CreepyPorpoise> @neraren I grab all the blue + ones, but the extras I don't bother with the first time by
[6:14:30] <FalseKingAki> these queues are pretty long
[6:14:33] <%barkon345> are all the streamers getting in be abuse they started early before the queues got out of hand?
[6:14:40] <%RealThiele> yes hes on my screen
[6:14:40] <FalseKingAki> at least it works thogh
[6:14:42] <otakon17> >small boy >red hair ...Pat?
[6:14:54] <neraren> Other classes makes sense I suppose
[6:14:55] <+Havictos> so a cop?
[6:15:27] <Yakobro> @barkon345 queue for me at 6:30 am was 8 lol
[6:15:30] <JobbedBone> cuno D:
[6:15:32] <@Velyndra> @PatStaresAt check dm
[6:15:37] <cartakus> Not being a FFxiv fan it's kinda fun trying to guess what is happening, not being successful though
[6:15:51] <%Puhff> @barkon345 anyone who woke up early and never logged out is able to get in easy.  streamer's just have abetter setup to never log off
[6:15:54] <Who_lio42> has @PatStaresAt seen the new VF5 Yakuza DLC shit
[6:15:55] <otakon17> I have NO idea what the story is in this game
[6:15:59] <cartakus> Problably?
[6:16:01] <otakon17> and I can't afford the monthly
[6:16:03] <@CreepyPorpoise> this is where I use my sus eyes

[6:17:55] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is the stream over
[6:17:56] <umbraawitch> well you're not very smart if you believe in eugenics in the first place

[6:18:05] <%RealThiele> cutscene warning can be like 5 minutes or 25 minutes too its varies wildly
[6:18:08] <arkv01> is that all the ff14 for today?
[6:18:11] <+starlorb3> i just got here tho

[6:30:09] <%THATGUY_789> lets all go to the lobby
[6:30:12] <Ids560> @cartakus nah it pretty much follows the same characters throughout, like some things are context spoilers but not much
[6:30:13] <@SpaceCapnCrone> oh god, I just thought "Are we gonna even be able to get through the queue to a different stream?" I've been in this queue TOO LONG
[6:30:17] <cartakus> RIP
[6:30:41] <KnivesEve> maybe that'll be enough time for me to catch up and past pat so I can enjoy his stream :)
[6:30:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> i tried that and it didn't work. do you have to do something other than target them to lock on?
[6:30:50] <@CreepyPorpoise> stinky friendship
