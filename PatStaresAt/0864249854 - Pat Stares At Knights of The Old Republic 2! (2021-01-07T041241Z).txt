[0:06:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sounds perfect
[0:06:22] <CursedNobleman> @SilverWolfX9 the combat and actual gameplay is stilted and not superfast, its not like fallout NV
[0:06:22] <%dekkitout> The horns aren't overpowering anymore
[0:06:24] <SilverWolfX9> keep the walking sounds. peak soul
[0:06:24] <%VoidBaronJules> yeah its good
[0:06:25] <Blank9> even on pretty bad speakers
[0:06:28] <ricky12k1> And stream just crashed for me for a bit
[0:06:31] <markfletcher> Is this the beginning of the game?
[0:06:33] <ironoverloaded> Not missing a single sound.
[0:06:35] <%a_goth_pancake> I can't hear much of anything with this bad ear.
[0:06:35] <%Romuken> time to get those other 600 back
[0:06:36] <ricky12k1> Alright twitch what happening?
[0:06:40] <%full_circle> full_circle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Wow, 6 months, which is the same number of days it took for things to go even more batshit insane here in the states! In any case, please smoosh Elmo and Z'geif's respective faces for us.

[0:06:50] <CursedNobleman> very nice
[0:06:53] <%Dakuu75> I like it
[0:06:54] <ancrest_tant> General mixing rule of thumb, use compressor to reduce the dynamic range and squish the signal and the limiter is there just to make sure you do not go above a certain level
[0:06:56] <ironoverloaded> Gucci. Not too loud or missing noises

[0:08:22] <+reallybigrocks> Audio engineering is hard and compressors don't make sense, take it from me I mix my own music
[0:08:29] <%Monkeyweed21> petition to rename cummies to drippies
[0:08:29] <TheNewJapanGuy> But are you Keyed Pat...?
[0:08:32] <NeroInfinite> It's not even saturday it's wendsday
[0:08:35] <%VoidBaronJules> it just took a game from the 00s
[0:08:36] <KiryujiKazamoto> @reallybigrocks this
[0:08:44] <%BinaryFireball> run a compressor on desktop audio?
[0:08:47] <%Broand> Are ranged jedi MCs even a thing in this game
[0:08:53] <Twiton> This game is a sentimental jalopy
[0:08:56] <$thesickestzak> KomodoHype
[0:08:59] <ironoverloaded> This is really good to listen to now, yeah. Even with the high combat music right now.
[0:09:00] <%dekkitout> Drippies can be cummies since drippies aren't a thing in relation to drip*
[0:09:01] <ricky12k1> Ok it just jump to 700 viewers
[0:09:01] <ancrest_tant> Limiters are made to C R U S H signal
[0:09:03] <Blank9> they are, ranged jedi work great
[0:09:03] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Anyway you playing dark or light?
[0:09:03] <%SirGO0SE> we love the stoopd
[0:09:04] <%cervidaequus> Its really really good audio now, thanks gobolins
[0:09:08] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt glad you found a clappy method to solve your problem
[0:09:08] <%chiazam> big nonsense
[0:09:08] <%VoidBaronJules> its been aces
[0:09:08] <abelincoln_catpuncher> How DARE you want a quality stream
[0:09:17] <%N0bdyNoOne> The pause in the music loop is driving me fucking nuts
[0:09:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @dekkitout cmonBruh
[0:09:19] <Twiton> You have to tweak and replace bits, but you'll never not want it to be just right. It's your comfort
[0:09:20] <$manwithboxonhead> What class is Pats Character?
[0:09:21] <Dave_VD> This game is a bitch just to play. I imagine trying to stream it is even worse
[0:09:21] <%Dakuu75> Yeah, I use Gain to lower the overall volume and "Limiter" to put a cap on the loudest volume allowed.
[0:09:22] <%mikessdd> Biggest Darkside Karen
[0:09:36] <%Agami23> vinny has to run a compressor for his audio too. the trash he plays will just switch his volume all the way up sometimes.
[0:09:39] <%dekkitout> Am I incorrect in my logic tajRLY
[0:09:39] <s1rcuit> @manwithboxonhead Karen class
[0:09:40] <Ultralazuli> You don't need to run from mines you set
[0:09:40] <Dave_VD> From a technical perspective that is
[0:09:44] <ricky12k1> Jeez this stream just got crazy
[0:09:46] <+reallybigrocks> Gain is just volume basically @PatStaresAt
[0:09:47] <Broken_Sonex> No wait, saw you're using shock. Going dark side, nice
[0:09:48] <+TheotherKristian> Os he ded?
[0:09:53] <%a_goth_pancake> ur good. honestly this is the first stream I've caught in forever and I'm having a fabulous time.
[0:09:55] <%AzureGale> Gain is what you put in the washing machine to clean your clothes
[0:09:56] <%Monkeyweed21> no Pat you should just have bad audio for the first year or two of your solo channel
[0:09:57] <+zeraux_> mod tis game into fallout new vegas
[0:09:59] <+kingofchaos56> tearAS2
[0:09:59] <%BoxNavy> pats still live :O
[0:10:00] <%SomeSageAdvice> Gain is meant to bring up quieter sounds and make them louder
[0:10:05] <%N0bdyNoOne> Gain is how much you amplifie the signal
[0:10:13] <KiryujiKazamoto> just point your mic at the TV
[0:10:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @manwithboxonhead Sentinel, then Sith Lord later
[0:10:22] <%BoxNavy> i was doing gold saucer shit all day hows the stream been?
[0:10:22] <1BeatGames> Did your stream go down recently? I got another notification of it going live
[0:10:24] <%BinaryFireball> thats the correct way to do it both compressor and limiter
[0:10:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> lewd
[0:10:38] <ricky12k1> Alright it is it mean chat or is the steam keep freezing?
[0:10:41] <%AzureGale> w/e
[0:10:45] <RushUnplugged> you thinned the herd, they wouldn't survive the winter
[0:10:45] <redrins> its kotor, there is no flow
[0:10:46] <%FacetiousAF> i mean you may have gotten it and that'll be good for next time??
[0:10:47] <%Ranryu692> it's a long game. might as well get it right early
[0:10:49] <%dekkitout> Killed the flow, but the hustle remains
[0:10:49] <%Agami23> who gives a shit. they werent true belivers
[0:10:50] <jimmytwofeet> @PatStaresAt Gain lets you amplify or reduce your signal (should be in the compressor), limiting sets a hard signal cap so you don't distort
[0:10:50] <ricky12k1> I think it is just me
[0:10:51] <fuji_92> vod ppl aren't real ppl
[0:10:53] <%N0bdyNoOne> Hilariously, I like it better when we can yell at each other for audio fixing

[0:11:39] <%full_circle> lol
[0:11:41] <ironoverloaded> It is a gargantuan task. I hate it.
[0:11:42] <Broken_Sonex> IT'S SO STUPID LONG
[0:11:45] <+reallybigrocks> I think the "correct" way to do it would be to compress it to the point where the dynamic range is acceptable then tweak the gain until it's at an ok volume @PatStaresAt
[0:11:48] <%nobleclonetrooper> @PatStaresAt I much prefer Peragus to Telos. Telos is such a drag.
[0:11:50] <%Mrbaconator> EXCLUSIVE TWITCH CONTENT

[0:12:03] <1BeatGames> Tokimeki Memorial was such a good review by Tim
[0:12:06] <%Maids4lyfe> special director's cut
[0:12:07] <%AzureGale> Gotta watch the Twitch Video for the full version
[0:12:07] <%DappercatEsquire> yeah, they're gonna mist the best joke you've told ever too which was in the parts that got cut out

[0:12:13] <%za7az> @jimmytwofeet You have a sick name, you may live
[0:12:15] <ricky12k1> I am going fix it myself
[0:12:16] <KiryujiKazamoto> Loudness wars
[0:12:24] <$manwithboxonhead> I have been watching WoolieVs KOTOR 2, and indeed, Hoes Mad.
[0:12:28] <Blank9> I'm just past the 14th playthrough on that tim review
[0:12:30] <%Darthwaffler> Anime watchers miss out again!
[0:12:32] <Blank9> I can't believe there's more
[0:12:35] <ironoverloaded> My husband bugged and fell through the floor on the steam version in the heated energy shield part, and I hadn't saved yet, and had to redo it.
[0:12:43] <%N0bdyNoOne> I always want to be this high
[0:12:46] <+GuilKato> @PatStaresAt wants to be higher than something........
[0:12:53] <KiryujiKazamoto> my rule of thumb for music is lead track must be a consistent 3db higher than backing
[0:13:02] <ihatemylifeitsux> Does anyone know what mods pat uses for this?
[0:13:04] <%radda343> christ watching this makes me want another star war rpg
[0:13:05] <+GuilKato> but you have the butt pillow now Pat
[0:13:10] <%a_goth_pancake> I wish I could get high right now...
[0:13:11] <KiryujiKazamoto> 6 is good
[0:13:14] <+GuilKato> that you stole for paige
[0:13:16] <ancrest_tant> Gain on the compressor should be renamed to “make-up gain” because the compressor makes it quieter and you would use that to bring yourself to where you would want. Increasing the ratio on a compressor would squish the audio harder and changing the threshold changes the volume that the compressor or limiter starts.
[0:13:18] <thatfeel> wha happen? No, seriously, I just got here and we're talking about audio levels
[0:13:20] <jimmytwofeet> @PatStaresAt You could also look at sidechain compression in future that will always duck the other audio below your vocal
[0:13:26] <%N0bdyNoOne> And the music is on -20
[0:13:31] <+reallybigrocks> Crank the absolute fuck outta that compressor then, afaik a limiter is the same as a compressor just configured differently @PatStaresAt
[0:13:34] <+zeraux_> its audio tallk today woo
[0:13:37] <fuji_92> Pat has to be the loudest
[0:13:38] <KiryujiKazamoto> sidechains confuse me
[0:13:42] <%N0bdyNoOne> @thatfeel The game audio was fuckingg loud and deafening
[0:13:46] <marvel877> Really weird trying to watch this, AGDQ, and CSPAN all at the same time.
[0:13:51] <cheapdoc> Bitch you're good
[0:13:53] <%slimmixrp> It lowers the volume whenever you talk
[0:13:53] <%BoxNavy> are you pat ?
[0:13:55] <walnutcast> basically "oh this audio is happening? turn down the other audio tracks"
[0:13:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ihatemylifeitsux Restored Content Mod, and he also mentioned the mod that messes with the lightsaber colors
[0:13:57] <theanora1> you seem fine to me, Pat
[0:13:58] <%slimmixrp> In a nutshell
[0:14:00] <+zeraux_> pat needs to blow out the speakers
[0:14:01] <%cylish> Fuck it im opening the rum
[0:14:07] <+TomDanksEGOT> stop
[0:14:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ihatemylifeitsux Not sure if there's anything else
[0:14:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> a loud
[0:14:13] <+TomDanksEGOT> thi sis a bad idea
[0:14:16] <$Invlux> LOUTER
[0:14:18] <jimmytwofeet> In that case compress the game audio and turn it down below your vocals to stay that way consistently
[0:14:19] <%SirGO0SE> Kreygasm
[0:14:19] <MrBaldachin> monkaS
[0:14:19] <fuji_92> feels the same to us, but idk
[0:14:19] <%Dementedpenguin> WutFace
[0:14:20] <+reallybigrocks> Sidechain compression would be triggered by your audio so it lowers the volume when you talk
[0:14:21] <+pally_din> Prime you eardrums
[0:14:22] <ihatemylifeitsux> @Valentinius_Anodyne thank you a ton
[0:14:22] <ironoverloaded> Doesn't sound different, really.
[0:14:23] <Twiton> RCM and some visual mods
[0:14:23] <%SomeSageAdvice> lol its the same volume it seems

[0:14:36] <$manwithboxonhead> Let’s talk about your take on KOTOR and the Star Wars franchise and where it’s going.
[0:14:37] <%nobleclonetrooper> @PatStaresAt What do you think the best method would be in making a modern KotOR game? How would the turn-based combat work?

[0:16:46] <Twiton> Give the Twitch chat control of your Volume Mixer
[0:16:46] <arkv01> the background noise is HUGE

[0:16:49] <+GuilKato> its fine
[0:16:49] <Broken_Sonex> @a_goth_pancake Shut the FUCK up.
[0:16:49] <Ultralazuli> it is clipping a bit
[0:16:50] <Coystick> It's really loud

[0:16:52] <fuji_92> nah, it's fine, but yeah it's all in the same lvl now both sfx and music
[0:16:54] <%mikessdd> He’s not wrong.
[0:16:55] <ironoverloaded> It's a lot more rumbly
[0:16:56] <$DocMadfox> Sounds fine to me?
[0:16:56] <%twistedj3ster> he's not wrong

[0:16:58] <KiryujiKazamoto> i like it
[0:16:58] <Jjaz_R> No. Stop.
[0:16:59] <%MidnightBurst12> A lot of rumbling
[0:17:00] <+GuilKato> the background noise was lower than the others
[0:17:02] <%FacetiousAF> what if you just... keep going for like 10 minutes and we find out???

[0:17:06] <%Monkeyweed21> the ambient station noise is much louder now
[0:17:07] <+GuilKato> it was at like 50% and the other stuff was at 75%
[0:17:08] <Blank9> that's the steam from that smoking stuff
[0:17:08] <GDM117> Its fine. Because the music is lower, everything is just louder
[0:17:08] <+GuilKato> originally

[0:21:53] <%Undenizen> why would he say it like that?
[0:21:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What sort of incredibly cunning killer could've killed all these people? The world may never know
[0:21:57] <Oak_bogle> That’s what happens when you step on the gaas
[0:21:58] <Twiton> This puzzle is fun
[0:22:09] <%Dakuu75> who is this character btw? is this the OC?

[0:23:57] <%BoxNavy> vineBrainyot
[0:24:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @s1rcuit I meant the armor. The "Mandalorian Combat Armor" isn't a Mandalorian design.
[0:24:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Peragus may be a bit long, but at least it isn't Taris-long
[0:24:09] <KiryujiKazamoto> why dont these space losers just use roman numerals like real people
[0:24:10] <fuji_92> 3 17 13 5 7

[0:25:00] <Broken_Sonex> THIS GAME'S PICK UP LEGIT RANDOM
[0:25:00] <abelincoln_catpuncher> WHAAAAT
[0:25:02] <%Broand> why'd that guy have a dark padawan robe
[0:25:03] <KiryujiKazamoto> i just realized, are lightsabers in the loot table already?
[0:25:04] <KaiserMario> That's a good sound clip
[0:25:05] <%juxtest> More like Dork Padawan
[0:25:05] <%mikessdd> Lucky ass drop
[0:25:05] <dinnydanny777> Mandalorians are aliens right?
[0:25:07] <%YakumoYomi> psaSmug
[0:25:08] <abelincoln_catpuncher> dayum that's a hell of a pull
[0:25:10] <Twiton> Don't expect much from this game in regards to the armour. It reused a lot to save time due to dev issues
[0:25:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @s1rcuit Very no. Mandalorians are a culture not a race. Any species can be a Mandalorian.
[0:25:12] <%Agami23> dont apologize for the game's audio being busted.
[0:25:13] <RandyFistburgers> the patawan
[0:25:18] <DestroyerPhoenix> tfuEvil
[0:25:18] <dinnydanny777> So why do Mandalorians look like humans...?
[0:25:25] <fuji_92> nah just lucky
[0:25:26] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:25:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In the new canon Mandos are being white washed but in Legends they weren't just humans.
[0:25:28] <KaiserMario> Both can be true
[0:25:29] <%Undenizen> Black is slimming. Stylish.
[0:25:34] <subjectg> @kiryujikazamoto only when you get your own, that’d be silly for game balance
[0:25:37] <%dekkitout> How soon till you get Naga Sadow's cod piece?
[0:25:38] <Javi9563> if only you had an item that makes you immune to poison
[0:25:38] <Broken_Sonex> No the game's drops are just legit random
[0:25:40] <%logoth_> beware the barf fog
[0:25:43] <%thatfeel> Mandalorians are a race
[0:25:44] <KiryujiKazamoto> darn
[0:25:44] <%a_goth_pancake> it's a shame you can't get the kotor 1 style robes.
[0:25:46] <%Maids4lyfe> @dinnydanny777 mandalorians are not aliens they are a culture
[0:25:47] <%nobleclonetrooper> Was playing this along with you for a while and I got a Dark Jedi Knight Robe here. How the fuck does some miner have Jedi robes?
[0:25:48] <%mikessdd> Lucky Ted never dies.
[0:25:48] <s1rcuit> @Too_Much_Nukie cool, didn't know that
[0:25:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The game has some locked drops but most are random.
[0:25:57] <audrus> pat, will you ever play patapon, because it has pat in the name?
[0:25:58] <KaiserMario> But Crazy talk still beats both your luck and your skill
[0:25:58] <KiryujiKazamoto> oh hi Revan face
[0:25:59] <%chiazam> Wow he got that drop quick
[0:26:14] <Twiton> The Mando Armour you get to wear is sadly reskins, not the one the NPCs use.
[0:26:14] <subjectg> Mandalorians were originally one race, but then they became an ideal/culture thing
[0:26:16] <%thedankestmeeme> BAKA
[0:26:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Taung are a species, Mandalorians are not.
[0:26:21] <subjectg> but that’s EU stuff
[0:26:22] <Blank9> it can't be helped
[0:26:23] <garbageheaphound> So is Pat going evil or good/
[0:26:26] <+GuilKato> @nobleclonetrooper its not a real robe.... they had a vibrant sexual roleplay going on
[0:26:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Please understand.
[0:26:28] <KiryujiKazamoto> that Revan face is totally based on Luke right?
[0:26:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Mandalorians are a culture, but I think all the ones you actually encounter in Kotor 1 and 2 are tge same race
[0:26:38] <ironoverloaded> Are you going to get mandalore when you can?
[0:26:38] <cookie_luck_> THEY REMOVED POGCHAMP
[0:26:39] <Broken_Sonex> @garbageheaphound Karren.
[0:26:40] <%Ranryu692> you're getting there
[0:26:43] <%thedankestmeeme> He's being good and being Evil
[0:26:43] <Klefth> Why does this look SO much better than when Wools and V played it btw?
[0:26:54] <%VoidBaronJules> Audio fixing made for a good stream and learning experience tho
[0:26:56] <%Dunmarkh> @Klefth mods
[0:26:57] <dinnydanny777> @maids4lyfe So how come so many of them seem to be humans
[0:27:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Valentinius_Anodyne Eh, hard to say for sure because they're all in armor.
[0:27:05] <MrBaldachin> mandalorians were a race during the old republic, but became a culture over time
[0:27:06] <%Dakuu75> what if pirates hear your distress signal?
[0:27:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They all speak basic at least.
[0:27:15] <%Maids4lyfe> because they are human @dinnydanny777
[0:27:18] <%a_goth_pancake> that'd be a good stopping point
[0:27:18] <+GuilKato> or you could have just left the thing unlocked
[0:27:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Too_Much_Nukie True enough
[0:27:26] <subjectg> And they’re all aussie
[0:27:28] <%thedankestmeeme> StoneLightning TheRinger RedCoat
[0:27:29] <shadic7700> Oh man how calculated and ingenious such a cunning and brilliant plan to eliminate so man meat—uh humans
[0:27:35] <ironoverloaded> What MrBaldachin said +1
[0:27:36] <s1rcuit> @Dakuu75 either way they're pretty fucked
[0:27:40] <%dekkitout> Aw sith!
[0:27:40] <%Maids4lyfe> @dinnydanny777 anyone can be a mandalorian they have to adapt to the culture and be adoped into it
[0:27:43] <%thedankestmeeme> who the hell are those guys
[0:27:48] <%BoxNavy> moon2DOIT let the hate flow
[0:27:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's pronounced Tee-Shi.
[0:27:53] <ancrest_tant> Knowing that this music was written by Jeremy Soule, it’s not surprising the music has an extreme dynamic range. He’s one of those composers that likens to classical music
[0:27:57] <%Ranryu692> @Klefth more mods
[0:27:59] <%thatfeel> There's a lot of alien races in Star Wars that are called "near humans"
[0:28:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The cooking of the duck meat was unsatisfactory.
[0:28:01] <dinnydanny777> @maids4lyfe But if they're a culture surely there should be more aliens, so many of them seem to be humana
[0:28:02] <%arancet> KK-ron
[0:28:04] <+GuilKato> the manager will be most displeased!
[0:28:07] <Twiton> I mean, the Mandos were kinda barbarians up until the Mando war
[0:28:12] <ironoverloaded> Is Pat going to put in the points to repair Hk?
[0:28:17] <KiryujiKazamoto> hard K
[0:28:21] <gnarly_memes_bro> @dinnydanny777 lazy writers
[0:28:25] <%Maids4lyfe> @dinnydanny777 human supremacy
[0:28:31] <DrStinkers> He has the M pass
[0:28:37] <Twiton> So that could be why they're now more human than anything else.
[0:28:48] <%Maids4lyfe> ^

[0:34:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Charisma or Wisdom yeah.
[0:34:12] <%SolidusRex> Yes, Wisdom
[0:34:13] <%nobleclonetrooper> Go Wisdom and Treat Injury and buff powers.
[0:34:13] <ironoverloaded> Wisdom and Int imo
[0:34:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> WIS
[0:34:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kreia is a great support for the Exile
[0:34:15] <MrBaldachin> wisdom con
[0:34:16] <Blank9> give her light side powers since you're evil
[0:34:16] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt All her force powers cast in combat also affect you. So if you're taking her with you, make her support
[0:34:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> She's so fragile some Con is a good idea
[0:34:17] <mihokspawn> cha, wis and nuking
[0:34:19] <+GuilKato> redit: Kreia: She starts out with high DEX and CON, so survivability is not a major concern here - what she can't dodge, she'll tough it out. But since she is a Jedi Consular, she'll be casting buffing and offensive Force powers all day everyday, so it's WIS is where it's at. Her locked neutal alignment means she doesn't suffer from penalties in Force cost, so she doesn't require a CHR increase and can take abilites from both sides of the Force without problems.
[0:34:20] <Blank9> all wis
[0:34:21] <CrimsonFox777> Luck Kappa
[0:34:22] <Twiton> Wisdom, Chas and Dex IIRC
[0:34:22] <%chiazam> Fuck Charisma
[0:34:23] <%jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Wis support
[0:34:23] <+megaman_sentinel> she*
[0:34:23] <ScantronTheImmortal> set her up for force power usage
[0:34:24] <%Alazull> Wisdom
[0:34:24] <KiryujiKazamoto> Kreia best character, but Handmaiden and Atton is my party
[0:34:29] <fuji_92> wisdom and charisma, she's your mage
[0:34:37] <MrBaldachin> int doesn't do much cuz her skills aren't super useful
[0:34:49] <ManfredA> buffs
[0:34:52] <%BoxNavy> panic panic panic
[0:34:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Light Side stuff maybe
[0:34:53] <%chiazam> HEAL
[0:34:54] <Paciboyy> Heal
[0:34:54] <ManfredA> any buff you don't take
[0:34:55] <olaksi> two weapon fighting, trust me
[0:34:56] <DestroyerPhoenix> buffing powers cuz they effect you too

[0:34:57] <$DocMadfox> Buffs
[0:34:57] <%nobleclonetrooper> Buffs so she can be an awesome support

[0:35:04] <fuji_92> heal, buffs and shit
[0:35:14] <KiryujiKazamoto> i want Force Amour
[0:35:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt The defensive ones are pretty good to give her because she'll keep herself and you buffed./
[0:35:15] <dinnydanny777> Nothing sus about her starting with Fear
[0:35:20] <KiryujiKazamoto> i will MAKE you love me
[0:35:21] <ALTRNico> she can't get heal?
[0:35:27] <%thatfeel> @patstaresat Every force power she casts on herself, you get
[0:35:34] <ironoverloaded> Whatever you want at this level, it's not too important
[0:35:36] <+Count_Graagh> poop
[0:35:37] <rsg220> not until level 6 @ALTRNico
[0:35:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> She's too low of level to get heal.
[0:35:39] <CrabSlacks> she's a buff bot
[0:35:42] <%nobleclonetrooper> IF she uses buffs on herself, they'll work on you too. plus she can use party buffs. It's great for her
[0:35:42] <+megaman_sentinel> support class
[0:35:46] <Broken_Sonex> She's very good for buffs, because of your force bond with here. Everything she buffs herself with goes to you. @PatStaresAt
[0:35:47] <Twiton> @PatStaresAt Kriea, for most of the game, is your support. She grants bonus EXP while in play, so if you're min-maxing you keep her out always.
[0:35:48] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:35:58] <Blank9> take valor
[0:36:03] <rsg220> stun droid is plenty good
[0:36:04] <%SolidusRex> Stun Droid is good though
[0:36:08] <Blank9> her buffs apply to you too
[0:36:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Force Valor is a good idea.
[0:36:08] <CrabSlacks> energy resistance
[0:36:12] <%chiazam> stun droid is pretty good dude
[0:36:14] <fuji_92> valor is fine
[0:36:18] <bigDEEforya> give her a big butt
[0:36:24] <Commander_Spyke> She also has the best dialogue
[0:36:26] <Laecerelius> Energy resist is always good
[0:36:27] <%Visorak6> D&D ahoy
[0:36:30] <%mikessdd> Stun droid is like having a version of shock that’s only for droids
[0:36:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Force Valor also can be used to pass skill checks.
[0:36:34] <%Agami23> its almost like theres an auto button
[0:36:34] <ironoverloaded> Stun droid is good, I was confused by Pat's reaction but I didn't know if I was going mad
[0:36:34] <Twiton> Until you get T3 she's also your Skill Monkey.
[0:36:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Could be worse, could be auto-levels
[0:36:41] <%mikessdd> It’s not a “stun”
[0:36:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Atton is your skill monkey not Kreia.
[0:36:52] <Twiton> You use her with Work Benches to get stuff early
[0:36:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kreia just has treat injury.
[0:37:00] <ManfredA> no
[0:37:04] <%Breaknoon> BIG music
[0:37:07] <%chiazam> no
[0:37:08] <%thatfeel> Jedi Support
[0:37:08] <ManfredA> force juice isn't hard to get in this game
[0:37:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Which isn't used at work benches, it's used at lab stations.
[0:37:09] <Twiton> No, we make granny do the Chemistry and Repair
[0:37:10] <%nobleclonetrooper> NO
[0:37:10] <Twiton> Ohhh
[0:37:16] <%Ranryu692> you don't need it
[0:37:22] <Twiton> I made her my Repair for most of the game
[0:37:22] <Blank9> just keep slapping buffs on her
[0:37:24] <wahilliham> any mods besides the restored content?
[0:37:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Her Self-buffs affect the Exile too
[0:37:29] <Paciboyy> not alot of force dudes to suck on
[0:37:39] <Twiton> @wahilliham Visuals and Textures
[0:37:40] <%Breaknoon> just learn Sukukaja
[0:37:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Why would you not give yourself repair and computer use for the checks?
[0:37:42] <%thatfeel> Second from the top power
[0:37:44] <%nobleclonetrooper> Force Aura isn't bad either since, when she casts it, it'll also affect the Exile.
[0:37:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Free abilities.
[0:37:46] <ManfredA> yeh
[0:37:50] <Blank9> yeah
[0:37:52] <+megaman_sentinel> u can do this pat don't let the goblins win
[0:37:54] <%Nobrev> yee
[0:37:56] <%chiazam> Ye
[0:37:57] <ManfredA> any buff she gives herself you will get for free
[0:37:58] <%justcallmebobplease> Any buff on Kreia affects PC, and vice versa, right? Because of the Force Bond?
[0:38:00] <Broken_Sonex> Also, remember Atton is a DEX beast. If you want him to use melee, get's the skill that coverts his DEX into strength.
[0:38:03] <Blank9> You'll want to give her a lot of light stuff, since you're darkside and she's neutral
[0:38:08] <Twiton> This game works well because you can use NPCs for several dialogue checks
[0:38:14] <Twiton> It's strange
[0:38:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she'll shank ya
[0:38:22] <DestroyerPhoenix> night stick granny
[0:38:25] <%nobleclonetrooper> give her a damn pistol :D
[0:38:29] <%chiazam> Woolie gave her a fucking battle axe
[0:38:31] <ManfredA> also @PatStaresAt if noone mentioned it to you, guns are super strong in this game unlike 1
[0:38:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's no fuck-off battleaxe, but it'll do
[0:38:34] <KiryujiKazamoto> i dont remember at all
[0:38:35] <ironoverloaded> Think they swap combat targets
[0:38:37] <%thatfeel> Change target
[0:38:37] <ironoverloaded> iirc
[0:38:41] <%AzureGale> I hear you
[0:38:41] <DestroyerPhoenix> are triggers not switch targets?
[0:38:46] <subjectg> swap targets
[0:38:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Don't forget to take Kreia's weapon before the Sion thing. She'll magically get a vibrosword from the cutscene dimension that you keep.

[0:40:14] <%mikessdd> This is a real fight too. Good luck pat.
[0:40:18] <%SaiyanShoto> I just started this game a few days ago but I like Atton way more than Carth
[0:40:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This fight is tough sometimes.
[0:40:21] <ironoverloaded> He is 100% just wise ass carth, yes Baron
[0:40:26] <ManfredA> @BaronVonProlix big no
[0:40:29] <shadic7700> “Rescue “

[0:40:53] <olaksi> oh yeah, just a carth stand in, nothing to see here
[0:40:54] <CursedNobleman> does he have a preset kill limit?

[0:43:07] <Twiton> Backhanded empathy

[0:43:11] <CursedNobleman> @ironoverloaded Bioware Male sidekicks are all the same. smartasses with a dark past. mass effect kaidan, DA2 crossbow dwarf
[0:43:17] <%mikessdd> He can quick save on controller. There’s a menu you can pull up.
[0:43:21] <Twiton> Charisma does have an impact on Force Powers IIRC
[0:43:27] <CursedNobleman> garrus is the best sidekick at least
[0:43:29] <%mikessdd> He’s been quick saving the whole time.
[0:43:29] <KiryujiKazamoto> @nobleclonetrooper but INT is knowing when to use smol pp to look likie big pp
[0:43:33] <ironoverloaded> @CursedNobleman Truer words have honestly never been spoken
[0:43:34] <KiryujiKazamoto> or something fuck you
[0:43:41] <ManfredA> It does but Kreia doesn't need it
[0:43:42] <$milhousego> is it just pat or is Paige with him?
[0:43:45] <subjectg> @patstaresat For future reference, there’s a message log menu in there that records stuff like dark/light points and exp. there’s a combat log there too if you wanna get your 3.5 on
[0:43:46] <Twiton> CHR and WIS are Force stats. Int is only for SKILL modifiers
[0:43:52] <tanarath> @patstaresat wis is better than cha for totes-not-sith lords
[0:43:54] <+MakeChrisLose> menu quick saving is for animals. keyboard for life, son

[0:44:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ehhhhhh
[0:44:09] <CursedNobleman> @ironoverloaded most certainly, i stole that observation from someone. so im giving credit to the guy i forgot about.
[0:44:09] <ManfredA> just for her
[0:44:09] <KiryujiKazamoto> what in space fuck
[0:44:13] <tanarath> More points.

[0:44:26] <HotMafia81> "What in space" top quality writing

[0:44:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she's a consular tho
[0:44:28] <%Romuken> for real? shiz
[0:44:28] <Broken_Sonex> You are the only character that benefits from CHS. Using it on party members is a waste. @PatStaresAt
[0:44:32] <+GuilKato> Kreia has no alignment penalty - she
[0:44:37] <%nobleclonetrooper> Kreia is in the middle so it wont have a big penalty. It's pointless. :D
[0:44:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Force powers are CHA+WIS so it doesn't matter.
[0:44:38] <$Invlux> jermaIQ
[0:44:41] <Laecerelius> She’s neutral you ditz
[0:44:41] <+GuilKato> she is perminant netural so wis not charisma
[0:44:45] <subjectg> @twiton there’s another message menu in there that’s different from the story text stuff
[0:44:46] <ironoverloaded> I wouldn't sweat the first couple levels of this game, tbh
[0:44:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Kreia is neutral
[0:44:52] <Twiton> @Broken_Sonex No, it's involved with several Force Power Values
[0:44:54] <Blank9> She has no penalties because she's neutral, but no bonuses because she's neutral.
[0:44:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Broken_Sonex That's wrong though
[0:44:59] <%thatfeel> @patstaresat Kreia is always neutral lol
[0:45:01] <%slimmixrp> No that's super not true
[0:45:07] <%slimmixrp> CHS is good on party members
[0:45:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Charisma totally benefits casters in Kotor 2
[0:45:10] <DestroyerPhoenix> i think you gotta say you're gonna scrap him?
[0:45:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Broken_Sonex Persuade is protagonist only. CHA and WIS both influence all force effects.
[0:45:20] <KiryujiKazamoto> facilitate communications, and bring about the termination of hostilities.
[0:45:21] <%nobleclonetrooper> Kreia doesn't have an alignment. that's the whole point of her charcater. :D
[0:45:27] <%Aeoneth> You killed the people who tried to sell me? I
[0:45:29] <KiryujiKazamoto> he loves big killing
[0:45:31] <%Aeoneth> 'LL KILL YOU
[0:45:37] <ManfredA> Kreia is the unique example in that she doesn't need Charisma at all

[0:45:49] <ironoverloaded> @Too_Much_Nukie But don't your skill checks sometimes carry to companions? Or am I remembering wrong?
[0:45:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @ManfredA But that's wrong.
[0:45:53] <Twiton> Your CHR modifier is added to your WIS modifier for SEVERAL Force Powers
[0:45:54] <%chiazam> @Aeoneth Yeah but only cause HK lied
[0:46:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> CHA and WIS BOTH affect force powers.
[0:46:08] <%dozind16> !uptime
[0:46:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 46m 19s.
[0:46:12] <Broken_Sonex> Ohhh, i was confusing CHS with persuade. Forget what i said @PatStaresAt
[0:46:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's their modifiers added together.
[0:46:18] <Blank9> The max level isn't 20, you'll blow past that and get more points than you know what to do with.
[0:46:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt It's fine. CHA and WIS are both good for casters.
[0:46:26] <ironoverloaded> I'm googling it to find out once and for all
[0:46:29] <%nobleclonetrooper> It is not worthless. But it's close to it.
[0:46:33] <KiryujiKazamoto> CUSTODIANS ARE IMPORTANT HK
[0:46:36] <ScantronTheImmortal> wis is better but cha couldn't hurt
[0:46:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> THE GAME FUCKING TELLS YOU ALL THIS
[0:46:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> IT'S RIGHT THERE EVERY TIME YOU LEVEL UP
[0:46:48] <ManfredA> unless I'm forgetting something, most of Kreia's spells you'll be using won't need CHA
[0:46:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what's a droid gonna buy with credits
[0:46:59] <%za7az> za7az subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Hey Pat! We all saw OMORI on your desktop. Would you consider streaming it? I feel like that's something the people would watch you play. Right chat?

[0:47:15] <Twiton> @Sphincter_Spelunker More Droids
[0:47:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Every single force power that affects an enemy target uses your CHA and WIS modifiers to determine whether it succeeds or fails.
[0:47:23] <+TheBitingIrish> More murder tools
[0:47:26] <KiryujiKazamoto> and robots LOVE money
[0:47:30] <Twiton> "not at all"
[0:47:35] <Twiton> Pat, she grants bonus EXP
[0:47:35] <bigDEEforya> PALPATINE
[0:47:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And a lot of them also use CHA and WIS modifiers to decide the damage done.
[0:47:39] <s1rcuit> do they ever say who the client was?
[0:47:41] <Broken_Sonex> THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
[0:47:45] <Twiton> She gets you more levels faster
[0:47:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but just take murder tools, through murder
[0:47:47] <subjectg> @patstaresat Both CHA and WIS affect the DC of your force powers, WIS gives you more force points and force regen, CHA gives less penalty for using force powers of opposite alignment. For Kreia, since she’s always neutral, CHA is not as good
[0:47:49] <bigDEEforya> OUCH
[0:47:54] <Twiton> @s1rcuit GO-TO
[0:47:54] <KiryujiKazamoto> the human body has 250 bones, that's one

[0:50:32] <ManfredA> to get DS points you need to be the biggest, dumbest asshole at all times
[0:50:38] <%thatfeel> All stats on Kreia are useless
[0:50:44] <Twiton> Pat, do not be kind to the droids
[0:50:44] <ManfredA> even if it's actively counter to a smart decision
[0:50:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Stealth isn't useless, you can craft really good items with stealth.
[0:50:48] <Twiton> Or to Kriea
[0:50:53] <ironoverloaded> CHA is used for negating force abilities used by opposite sides ie force storm, adds bonus to persuade, and adds +atk to allies in battle.

[0:52:58] <Twiton> RCM changes several outcome alignment changes in this game, but the FAQ does get most of them
[0:53:01] <DestroyerPhoenix> if you think you scrolled past a light side gained notification you can wait to see if the blue light animation plays or hear the light side music
[0:53:01] <ironoverloaded> Telos is gonna be fun
[0:53:10] <Broken_Sonex> HE IS A DES BOI
[0:53:13] <%FacetiousAF> @Reaverund yes, technically
[0:53:14] <Blank9> just pretend it's disco elysium and that failures are fun
[0:53:16] <%sumrand0> Man it bums me out to see these well designed Star Wars villains especially living in the current universe where according to disney it's "Oops All Palpatines"
[0:53:16] <Broken_Sonex> DEX*
[0:53:16] <ManfredA> yeh
[0:53:17] <%SolidusRex> Yeee
[0:53:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sure
[0:53:21] <%TeepPhoenix> None of this game makes sense.
[0:53:29] <%Dunmarkh> Don't tell anyone you leveled it up
[0:53:36] <%Dunmarkh> you fukin
[0:53:47] <ironoverloaded> Definitely Security.
[0:53:48] <Twiton> DEX is busted for Blaster Builds
[0:53:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Scoundrel, but that's the non-Jedi equivalent
[0:53:52] <%a_goth_pancake> just go with the flow, pat man. do what makes you feel good.
[0:53:58] <%Broand> GIANTS GIANTS GIANTS
[0:53:58] <+GuilKato> Atton: He starts out with a decently high DEX score and a pistol weapon focus, so early on he is your best bet for a ranged dps companion. Start building him towards two weapon fighting. He benefits from the melee weapon finesse feat, since his DEX is higher and investing most of his points into DEX is your best bet. Before he becomes a Jedi, put some points into his WIS (and optionally CHR) as well, so he can use Force powers more effectively.
[0:53:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Security is probably good
[0:54:01] <%juxtest> Maybe its Pat's perfectly calibrated TV, but I only just now noticed that the level up symbol is a L with an up arrow on top and not just some elaborate arrow
[0:54:01] <%sumrand0> @dunmarkh U TALKIN BOUT DEX?!
[0:54:02] <Twiton> Because you later get a 7+ Dex Bonus Heavy Armour potentially
[0:54:04] <olaksi> I really wish this game was remade, but there's just near zero chance of that
[0:54:13] <bigDEEforya> i remember jedi fights being more actiony
[0:54:14] <Broken_Sonex> If you want him to use a lightsaber, get the skill that converts his DEX into STR @PatStaresAt

[0:54:52] <+NovaTera> I just started another playthrough of this as well
[0:54:55] <%TeepPhoenix> Disney would probably like to erase this, KOTOR1, and Old Republic from existence.
[0:54:57] <ManfredA> he schuts
[0:54:59] <Blank9> he can still gun the whole game no problem
[0:55:07] <Twiton> Reminder, Rifles are gimped. Do not use Rifles.
[0:55:17] <highfivesquash> HK always be ready to zap niggas
[0:55:18] <Twiton> Rifles get no bonus from any other feats
[0:55:22] <Blank9> rapid shot?
[0:55:22] <%dekkitout> Uh... eye lazers?
[0:55:24] <ManfredA> improved power shot
[0:55:25] <ChungusQuest> Wow, all the shit in DC actually had a positive effect; all the senators withdrew the objections to election results.
[0:55:29] <Broken_Sonex> You can always do GUN JEDI
[0:55:29] <Paciboyy> i always give him two weapon double pistol
[0:55:29] <KaiserMario> Invest in luck

[0:55:32] <Twiton> Rapid Shot is good

[0:55:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @TeepPhoenix Disney wants to make a KOTOR movie

[0:55:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sure
[0:55:37] <+hailinpea> Yes
[0:55:38] <%sumrand0> @teepphoenix could be worse Disney could re-write KOTOR 1 & 2 and just make Palpatine behind it all
[0:55:39] <mihokspawn> dont lvl up atton, until nar shada?
[0:55:40] <ManfredA> it can be

[0:56:02] <LOTOTheKingOfRawTags> what mods has pat installed?
[0:56:05] <ManfredA> you want to get atton to 8 before then
[0:56:06] <highfivesquash> Disney wants to make a spiderman vs star wars movie becasue those are the two biggest money makers
[0:56:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nicely done Kreia.

[0:57:10] <Twiton> Can't believe HK is deda
[0:57:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> give Kreia a gun

[0:57:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @mihokspawn No. They don't get the sneak attack feats. That's scoundrel and scout only.
[0:57:18] <%mikessdd> The little droids are explosive. And she just naruto ran straight into them.
[0:57:21] <pilllowofbees> You diiiid it
[0:57:23] <+MayorRev> Is pat going jedi or sith?

[0:57:34] <%a_goth_pancake> now what did we learn, granny?
[0:57:36] <+GuilKato> two set her to support
[0:57:37] <%dekkitout> Old bat with a 12 gauge
[0:57:37] <%Ranryu692> change her from aggressive to jedi support
[0:57:37] <ManfredA> you can do an all gun build in this game
[0:57:38] <HotMafia81> Gun Grandma
[0:57:38] <%tyrianfolly> kreia looks badass with a gun
[0:57:40] <Blank9> guns are underrated
[0:57:40] <+GuilKato> instead of aggressive?
[0:57:40] <%TeepPhoenix> @sumrand0 This new High Republic stuff is gonna completely erase anything KOTOR related, for good or ill.
[0:57:41] <%Dunmarkh> @MayorRev big dark side
[0:57:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You don't want your caster in the frontline.
[0:57:42] <ManfredA> it's great

[0:57:50] <ygtidal> @mayorrev sith

[0:57:58] <DatGreyMind> How's it goin chat and Pat

[0:58:14] <mihokspawn> @Too_Much_Nukie it is what it is... I usully wait until then to decide howto build him
[0:58:17] <%a_goth_pancake> there we go
[0:58:18] <%nobleclonetrooper> @sumrand0 Nah, High Republic is only set 200 years before TPM. KOTOR is set 3000 year before.
[0:58:18] <Blank9> guns may as well give you an extra turn at the start, since you don't waste time running in to attack
[0:58:27] <LOTOTheKingOfRawTags> Cloud saves are super unreliable.

[0:58:52] <%sumrand0> @teepphoenix that's fine, I gave up on enjoying Star Wars a while ago. Once you let go of you love for a franchise no fuck up can hurt you

[0:58:57] <ManfredA> how much do you know about this game btw pat, like 0-10 spoiled?

[0:59:12] <%a_goth_pancake> you sure that's not just the tinnitus from the explosion?

[0:59:34] <Blank9> atton rules
[0:59:39] <LOTOTheKingOfRawTags> Atton's rad
[0:59:40] <Coystick> Why is she doing the duckface?
[0:59:40] <RushUnplugged> HR has literally nothing to do with kotor and it's millennia apart, kids.
[0:59:40] <Jjaz_R> lol her face
[0:59:42] <KiryujiKazamoto> wut!
[0:59:42] <bigDEEforya> SHE WANTS TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER
[0:59:43] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> We can't see the whole option ya dingus
[0:59:43] <Twiton> Yea
[0:59:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt As a dark side I'd recommend making Kreia hate you not like you. Raising her influence is hard as a psychopath.

[0:59:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Well nobody LIKES Atton, he's fun to have around as a little bitch

[0:59:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @PatStaresAt someone said kreia gets a free vibrosword before you leave Paragus if she has nothing eqipped
[0:59:51] <%sumrand0> GO PLAY PAZZAK ATTON
[0:59:52] <mihokspawn> But KREIA sucks too
[0:59:53] <%tyrianfolly> you're in bottom left
[0:59:54] <%wombatlime> D:
[0:59:55] <Twiton> Atton isn't bad, he's just really not happy to be here
[0:59:56] <%a_goth_pancake> oh you bitch
[0:59:57] <TapAtoLive> Atton is GOAT
[0:59:58] <%thatfeel> Depends if you wanna make him a jedi
[0:59:59] <+RigmaRolle> Too bad the text gets cut off
[0:59:59] <%kewlmyc> Atton's awesome, the fuck are you on about?
[1:00:01] <+CptBritches> @PatStaresAt Atton is better than Carth tho, right?
[1:00:05] <LOTOTheKingOfRawTags> What mods are installed?
[1:00:10] <%tyrianfolly> Atton's gr8
[1:00:11] <%sumrand0> KREIA = BAMF
[1:00:13] <Broken_Sonex> WOW looking at your girl now, she really looks like a Karren.
[1:00:16] <%TeepPhoenix> @sumrand0 Eventually you just want to play in the fanbase and have fun even if it isn't super quality. Look at all the memes springing from Episode 3
[1:00:16] <Twiton> Kriea has a lot of Dark Side Influence in Dialogue, but not in actions
[1:00:17] <CursedNobleman> troll grandma LUL
[1:00:18] <ironoverloaded> Atton is awesome on dark mode though, jedi him up and he rocks
[1:00:20] <KiryujiKazamoto> she does
[1:00:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no smashing allowed
[1:00:23] <%dekkitout> Grandman HATES your boyfriend
[1:00:25] <Blank9> your whole party HATES each other
[1:00:26] <dinnydanny777> She hates Atton LUL
[1:00:32] <Twiton> In actions, you need to do Cunning
[1:00:35] <%juxtest> Yeah lets just stay here until we starve, well thought out plan there Kreia.
[1:00:44] <%sumrand0> GET OFF THE RAG ATTON
[1:00:45] <ironoverloaded> @dekkitout HOWLING
[1:00:45] <%TeepPhoenix> GRANDMA HAS A GUN. DO NOT TALK SHIT TO HER!
[1:00:52] <KiryujiKazamoto> i love the concept of orbital drift charts
[1:00:53] <%TeepPhoenix> She isn't even trying to hide it
[1:00:57] <%thatfeel> What? Raising Kreia's influence is easy as hell. Just tell her what she wants to hear
[1:01:00] <dinnydanny777> Drift the ship like they do in Tokyo
[1:01:09] <%Anime_Flux> Atton... I'm not 100% in love with your tone right now...
[1:01:18] <ManfredA> you'll lose a lot of influence with her from being stupid evil
[1:01:21] <ironoverloaded> @thatfeel are you mad? She's the most hard to please woman in the planet
[1:01:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @thatfeel She will lose influence every time you murder people for no reason.
[1:01:36] <dinnydanny777> Is Kreia a Karen?
[1:01:40] <Blank9> make atton a true piece of shit
[1:01:40] <Twiton> @thatfeel It was as I thought. You have failed me. Completely and utterly
[1:01:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> She's really not if you understand her.
[1:01:42] <%mikessdd> @patstaresat Don’t level up any of your non-Jedi companions so you can pump them with Jedi levels when you convert them. You know. If you care to min max.
[1:01:49] <%TeepPhoenix> She's not even showing proper trigger discipline
[1:01:50] <%dekkitout> Listen, Force-Boomer
[1:01:54] <arkv01> DUN DUN DUN
[1:01:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> YEYEYE
[1:01:58] <CursedNobleman> DUN DUUUN DUUUUUUUN DUUUUN
[1:01:58] <KiryujiKazamoto> we wanted that?
[1:02:01] <bigDEEforya> DARTH KAREN ARISE
[1:02:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> EVIL MUSIC
[1:02:02] <%sumrand0> hahaha Jedi/Sith with a pistol is my favorite badass fan idea, fuck levitating lightsabers SHOOT GUN WITH THE FORCE
[1:02:02] <%Retinolgaming> It feels SO bad when Kreia dislikes you. lol
[1:02:03] <arkv01> yell at grandma get darkside brownies
[1:02:03] <ironoverloaded> Did Pat see us say we can't see dialogue options?
[1:02:04] <Profmcstevie> EVIL GROWS
[1:02:05] <ALTRNico> gotter
[1:02:05] <%N0bdyNoOne> DRAMATIC
[1:02:07] <Solokaldaka> I new Karin was a sith
[1:02:10] <%tyrianfolly> ALREADY YOU HAVE THE BLACK ROBES
[1:02:13] <Grandma_Amari> THEME OF LIGHT SIDE LATER
[1:02:15] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Kreia hates being told to shut up
[1:02:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the future is now, old lady. and it has, race mixing!
[1:02:18] <%tyrianfolly> Kae'Ryn
[1:02:21] <%thatfeel> You literally just have to agree with to get influence
[1:02:26] <+pally_din> Being mean to old women is very dramatic
[1:02:33] <Twiton> @ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter Except when she does like it
[1:02:34] <%SolidusRex> Kreia only wants the Exile to fuck Handmaiden (her granddaughter), I'm sure she'd try to push that on a FemExile if Handmaiden could tag along with a FemExile
[1:02:36] <KiryujiKazamoto> drama is the lifeblood of the Karen
[1:02:37] <%Dregon_Azure> did you want to lose influence there??
[1:02:37] <Paciboyy> i feel like kreia's thoughts on the exile dont make sense if you're just playing the dumbest evil asshole
[1:02:38] <ManfredA> ironically and probably intentionally, you either want your companions to hate you utterly or love you fully. You're rewarded for either
[1:02:41] <Broken_Sonex> They way you influence the party is to agree with them then talk about them with other party members behind their back. @PatStaresAt
[1:02:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mastercard
[1:02:47] <KiryujiKazamoto> Visa and Mastercard are great companions
[1:02:48] <$manwithboxonhead> This is going to be a fun lp.
[1:02:52] <Twiton> Yes, but knowing what she wants is actually difficult if you're not realizing her endgoal
[1:02:56] <$Invlux> Darth Kae'Ryn, the Fickle
[1:03:00] <+Ahnassi> Just listen to the GMilf. She's got shit figured out.
[1:03:02] <Broken_Sonex> TALK SHIT I MEAN @PatStaresAt
[1:03:10] <Twiton> Influence was an unfinished concept also
[1:03:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Wound me harder daddy KreyGasm
[1:03:26] <Blank9> more where that came from
[1:03:26] <KiryujiKazamoto> im partial to Mastercard and American Express, but Visa is also good
[1:03:36] <%mikessdd> I mean the best way to get Kreia influence up is to leave her on the ship.
[1:03:38] <Twiton> They had far more planned, especially for some characters that had only singular interactions for their influence
[1:03:41] <KiryujiKazamoto> in my dumb joke A-Express is Atton
[1:03:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That's fine
[1:03:52] <%mikessdd> Don’t let her see you be nice to the rest of the party
[1:03:53] <tuesti> yes its so long
[1:03:54] <%SirGO0SE> got em
[1:03:54] <%Retinolgaming> Peragus is LONG
[1:03:57] <Twiton> @mikessdd Talk to granny and bring her when you do trade deals
[1:03:57] <CursedNobleman> thats fair LUL
[1:04:01] <+pally_din> Yaaaay Obsidian first levels
[1:04:02] <%dekkitout> Paragus is 1/7 P5 tutorial
[1:04:03] <%N0bdyNoOne> COWARD!
[1:04:03] <%chiazam> People forget
[1:04:03] <%PaladinDupre> MINING OUTPOST STREAM!
[1:04:04] <Grandma_Amari> There's a reason people skip it
[1:04:05] <%sumrand0> YEAPPPPPPP there's some GRIND in this game
[1:04:05] <%a_goth_pancake> it's a thicc tutorial.
[1:04:07] <ManfredA> most people skip Paragus
[1:04:08] <%baka_sugoi> woow
[1:04:10] <Solokaldaka> pat taps out
[1:04:16] <%TeepPhoenix> Good bye
[1:04:18] <tuesti> pebble pat???
[1:04:20] <tanarath> baby
[1:04:23] <KiryujiKazamoto> Pat can walk? and i thought Woolie was the liar
[1:04:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> night night
[1:04:36] <tanarath> thanks for the stream, nerd
[1:04:37] <%a_goth_pancake> I love the new animation
[1:04:45] <arkv01> sugoiSchleep nighttt
[1:04:49] <s1rcuit> what is the origin of PlayMobil Pat?
[1:04:54] <ManfredA> getting influence with Barak-Dur is so fucking annoying if you miss even one interaction
[1:04:57] <ManfredA> and bugs don't help
[1:05:28] <KiryujiKazamoto> @ManfredA when i found out that i missed out on turning him Jedi when i was a kid i was so pissed
[1:05:37] <Twiton> @PatStaresAt Your best bet is both the Strategy Wiki, the Influence Guide on Reddit, the Xbox FAQ and the RCM Changes page on DeadlyStream. All of those will help you understand your current situation with influence. Any singular one may be outdated, so you use all of em at once. That's how you become Knight of the Old Republic 2
[1:05:44] <ManfredA> what's funny is that he sucks as a Jedi
[1:05:44] <%a_goth_pancake> @s1rcuit it's Quiet Viking's animation.
[1:06:00] <ManfredA> he's much better as the punchboy mechanic
[1:06:12] <Twiton> Anyway, that's all I gotta say
[1:06:15] <%mikessdd> It’s fun turning the whole party Jedi then not actually using any of them......
[1:06:47] <Twiton> Influence and Alignment are a pain at times, especially if you want Visas as soon as you leave Telos
[1:06:54] <%VoidBaronJules> tank the peepo taem
[1:06:54] <Broken_Sonex> He could always get the mod that just STOPS you from getting negative influence
[1:07:02] <%a_goth_pancake> HK and T3 never leave my party ever.
[1:07:10] <Twiton> Only if that's a Steam Mod
[1:07:13] <%FacetiousAF> psaDogchamp is that motherfuckin PAT
[1:07:13] <s1rcuit> @a_goth_pancake ok, figured it was a part of one of the many podcast topics I missed, like that Vergil shit
[1:07:17] <ManfredA> negative influence is good too though
[1:07:21] <%cvp5127> Thanks pat
[1:07:24] <s1rcuit> @a_goth_pancake thank you for telling me
[1:07:30] <%TeepPhoenix> uh huh
[1:07:31] <ManfredA> I roll with HK and Visas
[1:07:31] <%dekkitout> Nothing
[1:07:35] <%ssjklyco> It was a sound stream
[1:07:36] <NanayaPeng> Division 3 happened in America lmao
[1:07:37] <%Agami23> you did good pat. dont let the issues get you down
[1:07:39] <bleugh> PogChamp
[1:07:41] <%TeepPhoenix> don't thank me.
[1:07:41] <%thatfeel> HK and T3 are the true OGs
[1:07:46] <%Daniel_Is_I> The MMO?
[1:07:46] <Twiton> Yeah, make your companions hate you so much that they give you things in spite.
[1:07:49] <%mikessdd> HK and Visas are usually my picks.
[1:07:53] <KiryujiKazamoto> i wanna thank God. and i wanna thank Satan, for keeping him on his toes.
[1:07:53] <+PenmanLupine> The Old Republic?
[1:07:53] <%maenos2> old republic pat
[1:07:55] <%maenos2> the mmo
[1:07:55] <%cylish> its the mmo
[1:07:58] <%eyezehuhh> mmmmmhmmmm
[1:08:00] <Twiton> "I'm gonna become a Jedi just to spite you"
[1:08:02] <%TeepPhoenix> TOR is dog doodoo from what I heard. like ten years ago
[1:08:08] <%mikessdd> The mmmmmmmmmistake
[1:08:08] <%Undenizen> No worries on technical issues! You kept me nicely entertained while I worked on my craft projects! Thanks Pat!
[1:08:08] <%Dementedpenguin> I mean, he's right. It's 20 minutes into the new day. >_>
[1:08:14] <%maenos2> lol
[1:08:14] <%TeepPhoenix> They called it TORtanic. I don't know why
[1:08:17] <%Retinolgaming> Some of the story is good, Imperial agent is sick @PatStaresAt
[1:08:19] <+Yapdor> is pat done?
[1:08:19] <%a_goth_pancake> visas is a good pick. visas/handmaiden is a strong backup party.
[1:08:20] <ManfredA> TOR is okay but also one of the most scummy F2P mmos
[1:08:20] <%VoidBaronJules> dude live audio mixing and first exposure to the game was great today
[1:08:21] <KiryujiKazamoto> TOR is okay overall
[1:08:24] <s1rcuit> @a_goth_pancake I'm also glad you understood what you meant when I said PlayMobil
[1:08:24] <%SociallyAwkwardToaster> TOR is a fine single player RPG but not a great MMO
[1:08:32] <%Dementedpenguin> Depending on time zone, of course LUL
[1:08:35] <KiryujiKazamoto> @SociallyAwkwardToaster this
[1:08:44] <ManfredA> oh right did you get the mod that gives you all gender-locked party members @PatStaresAt
[1:08:55] <+CourageTheCat> BIGGEST NUMBER
[1:08:58] <%TeepPhoenix> Isn't that Snowpiercer?
[1:08:59] <+LionKagura> the shows mediocre imo
[1:09:03] <+Dova573> Thats SUPER ACCURATE
[1:09:11] <%AnIcedCoffee> TOR has several really good class stories, everything else is egh to really bad
[1:09:18] <KiryujiKazamoto> DIY treadmill? i can dig it
[1:09:24] <%whyskeywolfe> Building. It's going SUPER well.
[1:09:24] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Oh hey! I see you're rocking the Socrates cosplay again!
[1:09:27] <%a_goth_pancake> @s1rcuit lol yeah
[1:09:37] <ManfredA> and then they got rid of them after the first expac @AnIcedCoffee
[1:09:56] <BoneofMalkav> Pats of the Old Republic
[1:10:00] <%TeepPhoenix> Also, dang, Pat has more hair than one would expect. It's bushy
[1:10:00] <ManfredA> Darth Porb
[1:10:11] <KiryujiKazamoto> jedi, no. sith, no. Pat is SUPER gray jedi
[1:10:14] <%UW_Duncan> UW_Duncan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! dude, watching Tim Rogers do non-integral math in his head live on stream is the craziest thing
[1:10:20] <%FacetiousAF> fuckin AWE INSPIRING
[1:10:45] <nivlac_555> hard
[1:10:46] <%TeepPhoenix> very.
[1:10:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The thing is, can a deconstruction of Star Wars be the best Star Wars story?
[1:10:52] <%FacetiousAF> THEYRE OVERLOADED
[1:10:56] <%whyskeywolfe> It's not THAT hard but good luck doing it right now.
[1:10:58] <%mikessdd> I had people. Telling me not to play kotor. When I first played kotor. Because it’s too slow. And at the time I was like. Uhhhh. Slower than Dragon age origins? No? Then I guess Imma play it.
[1:11:00] <KiryujiKazamoto> the internet loves old jokes
[1:11:08] <HotMafia81> Not joking to, how hard?
