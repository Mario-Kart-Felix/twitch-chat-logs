[0:09:42] <%stigna1> Hey, so, chat. I'm the guy who's supplying the bestiary entries as Pat slays dudes. Y'all still want that, because I don't wanna dump out too much text here if y'all don't want it.
[0:09:42] <devanmuse> Spiral around the entire map, turning around half a screen before a vital movement upgrade? That's been your plan thus far.
[0:09:44] <+GuelermeDias> pat grinded just a little bit
[0:09:44] <lautalocos> WATER
[0:09:45] <mastermidget23> @TheGershon You ever sit at a public toilet and like, check to make sure your dick is below the rim of the seat so that you don't just hose over the front and potentially into your underwear? Yeah, I didn't check that day.
[0:09:47] <%NamaztakTheUndying> @GuelermeDias makes sense. Also sick username.
[0:09:49] <pennykettle_> Woolie was probably baffled that you got crystal peak dash because you dont have an early game ability yet
[0:09:51] <sparrrow_> GO GET YOUR MONEY BACK FROM THAT BITCH
[0:09:56] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Which ones have you done?
[0:09:56] <%happyface699> Jump down this time
[0:09:57] <Zanicedg> I'm at the end of the game and wanted to kill the Nightmare King. But it'll have to wait.
[0:09:58] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat the ancient basin would be a great place for that
[0:10:01] <$i_am_therydon> i had to go to bed last stream did he get his money back yet?
[0:10:02] <$Mendin> go left
[0:10:02] <%BioApple> Now that you have the dream nail scrubbing the map is basically the whole game
[0:10:04] <%umbypokochan> @AngriestPat don't scrub the map... SCRUBS the map

[0:11:56] <+Dimfish> @laguerrilha the dualshock 4, you can add it as a controller natively in steam and in big picture mode it will have custom support in all your games. On top of that it has the best button layout of all the controllers
[0:11:56] <rytisone> which one did you buy?
[0:11:57] <turbulentstriker> I use Ublock anyway lol
[0:11:57] <Futurecity10> Not if I have anything to say about that
[0:11:58] <dekkitout> i bet pat buys rocketfuel to make his car go fast too SeriousSloth
[0:11:59] <Ell1ot> good thing i don't have twitch prime
[0:11:59] <+Reevesypoo> It adds 1000 to the 1080 thats big numbers
[0:12:02] <Bendy_V> You're the reason they keep posting those graphs that show nothing
[0:12:03] <%happyface699> remember warframe PAT
[0:12:06] <+MinusTydus> They want you to subscribe to Twitch Turbo now.
[0:12:12] <%BioApple> you can always get twitch turbo and prime :^)
[0:12:13] <+Kawaso> do you think his PC will be able to run hollow Knight now?

[0:16:24] <MrMexicansPinataAdventure> Also the devs have gone on to say that this game is not inspired by Dark Souls.

[0:16:56] <%TheImmortal70> Bone graft
[0:16:57] <%SuperCasualBoom> Boner Graft
[0:16:59] <%TheImmortal70> Fuse together bones
[0:16:59] <quicksilvermad> Pat, we're the same age—I always look as shadow-eyed as you.
[0:17:04] <sparrrow_> why would you need a bone graft in your mouth
[0:17:05] <+GuelermeDias> this is not inspired by ds just as much as deadly premonition wasn't inspired by twin peaks
[0:17:08] <DapperHatwell> Everyone's scared of the dentist, but I don't understand it. My dentist is cool as fuck.
[0:17:09] <%vivecdidnothingwrong> Bone graph
[0:17:12] <%TheImmortal70> In other words the open your mouth up and pull everything open
[0:17:12] <demonhunter790> He’s getting 3 bone grafts
[0:17:14] <zafooru> bone graft > attack by gun
[0:17:14] <+NWR_James> "Dont get a bone in your mouth"
[0:17:15] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Break a femur and have a bonegraft from the other femur?
[0:17:15] <+drakthebest> Oh man I really didn't think we'd be getting another stream for at least 3 days

[0:17:28] <+forester13> Pat I watched your RE2 stream and it inspired me to start semi-speedrunning the game, and I just got my first A rank with 3 saves and just a tad over 3 hours on LeonB

[0:23:00] <demonhunter790> 🍕 w🍕
[0:23:01] <SatansDick1> unless he does a 10 hour stream
[0:23:02] <+Tylermcd93> Idk he seems at like the 60% mark
[0:23:03] <+Onlysamfisher > beat it you COWARD
[0:23:04] <$magikestral> barely 40%
[0:23:05] <+Roundelay11> It's a pretty big game
[0:23:06] <+jjjkopf> 16 hour stream double it let's go
[0:23:07] <ssmotzer> If Pat made a bee line for the bosses probably
[0:23:07] <+MonXara_Z> time to dab on all the missed story progression

[0:23:10] <DapperHatwell> Ha! Finish hollow knight tonight.
[0:23:10] <thetechnicalraven> Vous avez besoin du RED BULL
[0:23:12] <hntronium> HE FINISHES TONIGHT
[0:23:13] <+GuelermeDias> so he's definitely finishing it
[0:23:14] <dekkitout> prior to last stream, i had no idea what 'winions' were, now all i want in life are more winions
[0:23:14] <@thenefftw> It takes away from Elmo time
[0:23:14] <DapperHatwell> That's funny
[0:23:14] <SatansDick1> your at 10 % pat
[0:23:15] <+kiiiirsten> stop rubbing elmo hair into your eyes
[0:23:15] <strangelee> Has he even SEEN DLC content aside from charms?
[0:23:15] <%stigna1> Hopefully he goes for the extra optional stuff. Its amazing content.
[0:23:16] <dandyspider> check your game %
[0:23:18] <@SSaryn> Elmo hate phone because it get more attention.
[0:23:20] <quicksilvermad> For real. Drink more water for your poor eyeballs.
[0:23:21] <%hatesdps> sbfpRichard

[0:23:28] <DXLelouch24> no NOT EVEN CRAZY TALK CAN MAKE HIM BEAT IT TONIGHT
[0:23:33] <BlackV0rt3x> Are we gonna 100% the game or call it quits when you beat the final boss?
[0:23:33] <+Kawaso> he doesn't have game % yet
[0:23:33] <@SSaryn> Use Blue Light nerd.
[0:23:36] <%lutefiiisk> Pat, how are the eyes?
[0:23:38] <%zer0_11> He'll finish tonight because the game will be shit easy from all the grinding he has done off stream
[0:23:39] <%stigna1> @strangelee He ran into the corpse, and the lifeblood hive and some lifeblood stuff plus the integrated mechanics like map pins.
[0:23:42] <DXLelouch24> HOLLOW KNIGHT MORE POWERFUL THAN CRAZY TALK
[0:23:47] <+GuelermeDias> put a picture of alf in your phone's screen to teach elmo fear and repect
[0:23:49] <DapperHatwell> If Pat finishes tonight, he will die. He can't take another 8 hour stream.
[0:23:53] <SirSmudgey> Holy crap, so many streams this month
[0:23:53] <demonhunter790> DA🅱️
[0:23:53] <SatansDick1> fuvk auto brightness

[0:26:20] <%Divryne> Yes.
[0:26:23] <@thenefftw> Let him decide what to do on his own
[0:26:23] <Eresus> yes
[0:26:25] <SatansDick1> yes
[0:26:26] <%Divryne> Big Ancient Basin.
[0:26:26] <DXLelouch24> Pat dont forget to dream nail everything
[0:26:26] <DapperHatwell> What abilities does he have right now?
[0:26:30] <DXLelouch24> enlcuding enemies
[0:26:33] <Bendy_V> King's Station fast to Ancient Basin
[0:26:33] <Tisaric> yeah the grey area is ancient basic
[0:26:35] <DXLelouch24> including*
[0:26:35] <thetechnicalraven> Alright everyone, start placing bets for how long into this stream Pat will die
[0:26:36] <%lutefiiisk> The developers said that The God expansion would be the last FREE one. Makes me wonder if they'll expand with more Characters. Would love to play as The Needle Girl
[0:26:38] <Tisaric> basin*
[0:26:40] <+Dimfish> go for it
[0:26:40] <thetechnicalraven> !uptime
[0:26:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 26m 42s.
[0:26:45] <+drakthebest> Ancient basin is below waterways, it's where progress is (movement). Greenpath is something you can do at the lake you couldn't cross earlier
[0:26:47] <+Dimfish> ancient basin is a fun time
[0:26:48] <DXLelouch24> Hornet DLC is happening
[0:26:52] <DXLelouch24> keep up
[0:26:54] <%D_day> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:27:00] <+TeethMuncher> So another 8 hr stream?
[0:27:03] <$TheNeedlesD> Pat ever get his money back from the Bank?
[0:27:06] <SatansDick1> minion build
[0:27:06] <%happyface699> God I’m tired my eye is twitching
[0:27:06] <DapperHatwell> Oh jeez
[0:27:07] <%BioApple> @lutefiiisk there is a hornet expansion in the works and unless pc gamer made a big typo it's also confirmed free
[0:27:08] <%stigna1> @lutefiiisk A Hornet campaign was a stretch goal that got met and they are working on! Feels good!
[0:27:08] <pennykettle_> Is it true that the hornet campaign makes her PLAYABLE? I thought it meant it would add new DLC adventure about her
[0:27:09] <DapperHatwell> He has so much
[0:27:12] <$Mendin> Taking bets onto how long before Pat falls into a pit again
[0:27:13] <Eresus> @lutefiiisk it has been confirmed for ages that hornet is going to be playable
[0:27:14] <%Mev852_> Pat will survive until he runs into a boss that does 2 damage per hit
[0:27:18] <+JustToWatch> COMPASS
[0:27:19] <+Dimfish> @TheNeedlesD nope
[0:27:20] <%stigna1> @TheNeedlesD Yup, though he got close. He seems to have forgotten about it now.
[0:27:22] <DapperHatwell> That 8 hour stream is going to be rough to catch up on
[0:27:27] <%theKittenhugs> hey dinguses
[0:27:28] <%stigna1> Err, yeah, nope.
[0:27:29] <%lutefiiisk> @DXLelouch24 Fuck yeah, man. I just got the game this weekend after finding out that my 6 year old PC could handle it just fine
[0:27:30] <strangelee> Pat will never find all the synergies
[0:27:33] <+drakthebest> Baldur's shell is actually pretty bad
[0:27:39] <%stigna1> @theKittenhugs HellO! ^_^
[0:27:42] <%craig_t> !uptime
[0:27:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 27m 44s.
[0:27:55] <%stigna1> Wow, that was a fast intro.
[0:28:05] <Tisaric> no yeah Hornet DLC is playable hornet side story
[0:28:13] <Tisaric> I don't know if it'll be free though
[0:28:13] <Eresus> baldur's shell is garbage
[0:28:14] <DapperHatwell> The shell sucks
[0:28:15] <SuttonTM> Pat and Chat! rooVV
[0:28:20] <+JustToWatch> only when you're healiing
[0:28:20] <$Mendin> When's the Zote campaign
[0:28:24] <SirSmudgey> shell is overrated, especially when it can break
[0:28:27] <Parapattern> Baldur's shell is made of cotton candy and lightbulb glass
[0:28:27] <DapperHatwell> I've never had any success with the shell
[0:28:28] <+Dimfish> The shell is good for swarming bosses
[0:28:28] <dandyspider> shell comes up when focus soul
[0:28:29] <$magikestral> shell interrupts too easily to be good
[0:28:29] <$Mendin> Or the Cornifer Stealth Mission
[0:28:31] <%BioApple> grubsong is big good tho
[0:28:31] <%NamaztakTheUndying> that looks like a wireless controller
[0:28:32] <SatansDick1> make shit bombs
[0:28:33] <%D_day> apatBig sfhME sfhME apatDab
[0:28:34] <%NamaztakTheUndying> what controller is that
[0:28:35] <$shadow1man9> Did Pat go back to the sewers yet?
[0:28:35] <$Mendin> Or BAH HUNDO
[0:28:41] <Hydrapissed> Dank focus
[0:28:43] <%stigna1> Pat loves naruto confirmed.
[0:28:44] <Gehtingsberg> Winking build ftw
[0:28:47] <+bonzosan> the shell is real good for one boss fight later on
[0:28:47] <%zer0_11> look at all those off stream charms
[0:28:49] <Bendy_V> Soul go up
[0:28:52] <+Dimfish> he's on his way to the ancient basin
[0:28:52] <Gehtingsberg> Winion*
[0:28:55] <+Kawaso> you left a charm slot open
[0:28:58] <%lutefiiisk> I got Dead Cells and Enter the Gungeon. I don't care for any of them, but this game was fucking mindblowing. Haven't liked a game as much in years.
[0:28:59] <Eresus> battlemage build let's go!!
[0:29:02] <%Mev852_> GDI Pat you actually have to pick up the GEO
[0:29:03] <$Mendin> Didn't pat upgrade his nail as the last thing before he fell asleep?
[0:29:05] <DapperHatwell> Ancient basin will be gooooood
[0:29:05] <DraxTD> The Biggest, Strongest @AngriestPat
[0:29:06] <SatansDick1> you left charm slot
[0:29:06] <+Thepothero> BIG DMG
[0:29:08] <+TeethMuncher> But does Pat like like it?
[0:29:11] <Hydrapissed> Now put soul catcher on
[0:29:11] <Tisaric> hell yeah battlemage time
[0:29:12] <+kiiiirsten> If you're gonna claim your game isnt inspired by dark souls you might not want to overuse the word SOUL
[0:29:12] <%SuttonTM> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:29:12] <+Dimfish> this game has fun battlemage builds
[0:29:18] <%stigna1> @Mendin Yup! Upgrading the nail does not boost soul gen though, that's just soul eater.
[0:29:18] <%SomeNEET> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab

[0:29:40] <%SomeNEET> OVERCHAAAARM

[0:29:45] <$magikestral> regular soul thing at 2 is fine
[0:29:45] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat give steady body a shot
[0:29:49] <$Mendin> OVERCHARM YOU COWARD
[0:29:49] <DapperHatwell> Quckslash
[0:29:51] <@thenefftw> But you're a crazy man
[0:29:51] <$RaikenTB> GEISER
[0:29:52] <custoadian> swap mark of pride for longnail?
[0:29:54] <+Dimfish> NO COWARDS
[0:29:55] <SirSmudgey> Overcharm is dumb as hell
[0:29:55] <%stigna1> So less backseating this time, eh? :p
[0:29:56] <+shawntk_> BECOME OVERCHARM
[0:29:57] <$magikestral> soul catcher!
[0:29:58] <Hydrapissed> shaman stone is dank as well
[0:29:58] <+Ranmaru_Richu> Do it!
[0:30:00] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Overcharm it you won't
[0:30:01] <%BioApple> overcharm fury of the fallen. true red tearstone build
[0:30:03] <DapperHatwell> Stick with nail charms
[0:30:05] <Hydrapissed> quick focus is great stone is nice
[0:30:05] <$shadow1man9> Shaman Stone + Grubsong
[0:30:06] <+drakthebest> Note that you can overcharm by more than 1 charm and it doesn't matter how far you go over
[0:30:08] <+Gorgodrn> Overcharm and just don't get hit Kappa
[0:30:08] <circular7> but you ARE crazy
[0:30:09] <DapperHatwell> You have to synergize
[0:30:10] <+Dimfish> you could swap mark of pride for longnail
[0:30:11] <%Sirculbs> could just try not needing a "You are here" point on map
[0:30:11] <kollosae> So crazy it might work rooVV
[0:30:16] <+Dimfish> they are already organized
[0:30:24] <SatansDick1> thaat might actually work
[0:30:26] <%skizzuto> wow that's the build I use all the time
[0:30:29] <dandyspider> do fluke with defender's
[0:30:31] <Bendy_V> Good all round build there
[0:30:32] <Parapattern> That's a pretty good standby for exploring
[0:30:35] <+Dimfish> this builds pretty alright
[0:30:39] <$shadow1man9> Back to the Sewers then?
[0:30:40] <%stigna1> Man, Grubsong is so good. Much like pat, I just keep sneaking it on there because why not?
[0:30:46] <faldin> isnt mark of pride just a better long nail?
[0:30:50] <+Dimfish> @shadow1man9 he said he's going to ancient basin
[0:30:51] <Hydrapissed> or hows about mark of pride + LONG NAIL sephiroth doo dod od dooo
[0:30:54] <+Dimfish> which isnt a bad idea
[0:30:55] <Sleepology> Did pat ever find the banker?
[0:30:57] <%stigna1> @faldin It is, but it costs more charm slots.
[0:31:08] <$magikestral> yiu didn't do all of it
[0:31:10] <pennykettle_> Can we all agree not to backseat or tell him where to go tonight? I watched VOD chat and you guys were miserable
[0:31:13] <+Grayhammatter> mark of pride and longnail
[0:31:21] <scrumdrew> @Sleepology oh boy did he ever
[0:31:26] <%stigna1> @Sleepology Nope, but it'll come together eventually. He seems to have forgotten how mad he was about it too, so it'll be a pleseant surprise eventually.
[0:31:38] <Sleepology> did he or didnt he NotLikeThis
[0:31:42] <$Mendin> Also it eating your Soul
[0:31:45] <pennykettle_> np
[0:31:48] <pennykettle_> no*
[0:31:52] <asbestosflavored> never had soul for healing
[0:31:54] <%stigna1> @Sleepology He found the bank, deposited money and failed to find her again.
[0:31:56] <%BioApple> @Sleepology he found the bank but didn't find her after she left, depends on what you're asking
[0:31:57] <+s_snowball> D:

[0:34:24] <+drakthebest> No pat there's another door in that area
[0:34:26] <+drakthebest> With a grub
[0:34:26] <%stigna1> @i_am_therydon Nope, not yet.

[0:34:45] <+kiiiirsten> oof
[0:34:46] <%stigna1> @strangelee The speedrun strat is to kill yourself and pogo off your ghost so almost immediately.
[0:34:55] <+Dimfish> he almost ate shit like three times
[0:34:56] <californaya> Dream Nail takes a WHILE
[0:34:57] <strangelee> Ok, but not glitched?
[0:35:01] <$magikestral> @strangelee pretty early, if you get soul sanctum done quick and head to crysyal peak
[0:35:02] <+SuperMonkey2> spooky
[0:35:03] <SatansDick1> i thinks thats the point
[0:35:05] <%stigna1> @strangelee You get get to it via the lake, from the crossroads.
[0:35:06] <$Mendin> He says as the smoky black evil wafts up
[0:35:11] <custoadian> You can get it after the lantern
[0:35:12] <+Dimfish> its a horrid rotting brown lighting
[0:35:16] <NerevaRising> has pat gotten the ability to traverse acid yet?
[0:35:16] <%Divryne> It's a dank area.

[0:35:22] <deviljhojho94> dankest dungeon
[0:35:23] <+drakthebest> It's also the music. The music is gone in this area and replaced with the sound of crawling
[0:35:24] <+wal__rus> melee
[0:35:25] <+Fenlig> Has pat been to the arena?
[0:35:26] <$magikestral> did pat save the npc here
[0:35:29] <Kghaleon> Lost kin hype.
[0:35:36] <Parapattern> I love love ultra deep, ancient places in games
[0:35:41] <%Divryne> Shhh.
[0:35:51] <pennykettle_> @Parapattern YESSSSSSSSSS
[0:35:51] <SatansDick1> where
[0:35:52] <%umbypokochan> Pat loves to say chromatic aberation
[0:35:53] <+Dimfish> @Grayhammatter its okay, theres a thing later in the game that will help him find grubs super fast, so its no worry
[0:35:58] <%lutefiiisk> Bloodborne like
[0:36:01] <%stigna1> Chromatic abberation sounds like a Lovecraft monster. Is that just me?
[0:36:02] <$Mendin> @AngriestPat When you think about it, insects often see in a lot of different colorschemes than humans do, so
[0:36:05] <%umbypokochan> say it 10 times fast
[0:36:15] <+JustToWatch> yeah
[0:36:19] <+Dimfish> no
[0:36:22] <+Dimfish> not all the way

[0:36:29] <+Tylermcd93> Thoughts on the new Nvidia cards? Or have you mentioned it already at the beginning?
[0:36:29] <SatansDick1> not all the way
[0:36:29] <%stigna1> He is missing some stuff here, yeah.
[0:36:30] <%TheGershon> It's better that devs abuse it as opposed to bloom like they used to
[0:36:37] <Gehtingsberg> BIG words for BIG BOIS
[0:36:38] <+Dimfish> you didnt go all the way down that side
[0:36:39] <zaiwolfgang> pat go back
[0:36:41] <+Grayhammatter> so is there fan art of elmo as a grub?
[0:36:43] <+Dimfish> yep

[0:36:47] <SatansDick1> true
[0:36:47] <+JustToWatch> def
[0:36:51] <+Dimfish> thats also a good idea
[0:36:52] <$Mendin> Oh of course there is
[0:36:55] <%lutefiiisk> Kornifer
[0:36:56] <Burpinator1> He should explore Ancient Basin all the way

[0:37:03] <%BioApple> CA is only good as a sci-fi debuff
[0:37:04] <pennykettle_> ancient basin is my fav thematic videogame thing

[0:37:19] <+GuelermeDias> lens flare was a meme during the mid 00s
[0:37:27] <+Dimfish> the buitecture is why i LOVE city of tears
[0:37:29] <Futurecity10> What the fuck was this kingdom
[0:37:32] <+Grayhammatter> what is this? a kingdom for bugs?
[0:37:37] <+Tylermcd93> Has he found the banker yet?

[0:38:06] <%stigna1> Hey, whomever wanted him to dreamnail the creepers they say "..." and that's it. As opposed to most bugs that say things like "hungry" or "afraid."
[0:38:08] <deviljhojho94> bafanada enjoys only the thrill of combat

[1:03:54] <Tisaric> I don't think he did
[1:03:55] <+NWR_James> He did it
[1:03:56] <%Spydurman> no

[1:04:20] <@thenefftw> I DID NOT HIT HER, THAT'S BULLSHIT, I DID NOt

[1:04:24] <Endocrom> Nail the grubmo!
[1:04:32] <NerevaRising> chat, should I replay this game now or wait for the godmaster update to start?
[1:04:36] <devanmuse> okay, Pat, seriously, maybe juggling a video game and livestream is not the best time to host a phone call with your girlfriend
[1:04:37] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat also pogoing resets your double jump and dash abilities
[1:04:37] <%cirdrag> life is hard
[1:04:39] <$magikestral> the crystal dash was the best idea
[1:04:42] <%umbypokochan> you did it fine but you got hit, just do again
[1:04:44] <+drakthebest> You can just dash and jump while midair
[1:04:47] <+VanaSkiller> NOW hang up
[1:04:48] <AncelDeLambert> You had it, dude, you got hit
[1:04:48] <+drakthebest> Hard jump but you can make it
[1:04:49] <grayjammer> Wow you're doing it the most ass-backwards way possible
[1:04:50] <%knota> just dont get hit
[1:04:51] <+shadowace2400> crystal dash into double jump
[1:04:51] <+GuelermeDias> three things pat does badly ,done together
[1:04:53] <+Dimfish> use your double jump pat
[1:04:54] <hntronium> You can cancel crystal dash witha jump
[1:04:56] <Them00n> Hyperdash off the wall into a double jump
[1:04:58] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you literally just did it the right way, but then the goo blocked you.
[1:04:59] <%Mev852_> @devanmuse agreed
[1:05:00] <CptBritches> Pat admitting he hung up
[1:05:01] <KaiserMario> "Stop bitching, start killing!" - Gladio
[1:05:01] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat you can jump, dash, then double jump
[1:05:03] <Gehtingsberg> LUL LUL LUL
[1:05:05] <thetechnicalraven> Pat admits to hanging up on Peach
[1:05:05] <$magikestral> you did it with the crystal dash cancel @angriestpat
[1:05:09] <%lutefiiisk> 2600 CAD Video card!
[1:05:09] <Ell1ot> Paige is going to put fries in your nose while you're sleeping
[1:05:10] <$Mendin> Could start now, the game's nonlinear enough that by the time you get to godmaster and if you want to restart it would be a different feeling playthrough
[1:05:12] <+shadowace2400> dash into double jump
[1:05:18] <magmakhan3> just regular dash and double jump would work
[1:05:23] <President_valentine> Liar
[1:05:27] <Ell1ot> LEWD
[1:05:28] <Zombrocom> Eww
[1:05:28] <%stigna1> Woah, easy there Patrick, we backed you up on that one.

[1:11:58] <%ThisHappyDucky> @kenpachi9211 is that just a bind?
[1:12:00] <Burpinator1> @SSaryn not withDefenders Crest
[1:12:00] <%stigna1> Yeah, the hardest thing about this fight, I think, is that the adds keep coming even when you stagger the boss. So its hard to heal.
[1:12:12] <+Dimfish> he wobbles his head back when he's gonna dash
[1:12:13] <%Sam_Tzu> you got this pat
[1:12:23] <Endocrom> He rears back before dashing and crouches a bit when jumping
[1:12:25] <@SSaryn> Fast heals are dumb, DPS big

[1:12:50] <pennykettle_> jermaNosewipe

[1:12:51] <chza> maybe if pat didn't use a controller like a pleb he'

[1:12:59] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat use the ground slam it's like a power geyser and hits above you
[1:13:00] <+drakthebest> Don't try to face tank him or get a lot of hits in when you think he's low, he has a LOT of health, and he gets stunned 4 times. Focus on not getting hit, not on hitting him

[1:13:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 13m 35s.
[1:13:35] <%BioApple> actually it's not a terrible idea to dream nail him in that state, it gives mondo meter
[1:13:39] <$magikestral> @angriestpat a good tip: ground pound has a good chunk of invincibles frames
[1:13:47] <%stigna1> Man, lucatiel was the coolest.
[1:14:02] <$Mendin> The orange evil blending into the background is what always gets me in this fight
[1:14:03] <+aerdus01> wait, is this Anor Londo?
[1:14:08] <EMP_Ike_Turner> you can do it, you can win, you feel great
[1:14:11] <$Mendin> This is more Black Gulch
[1:14:19] <crimsonharvest> is this the king of the orange goo gas?

[1:14:31] <+Dimfish> shoulda healed
[1:14:31] <%QueequegTheater> @BioApple Yeah, but it's also the only time you can really heal
[1:14:33] <SatansDick1> in the stun state hit him with the dreamnail
[1:14:33] <thetechnicalraven> LUL
[1:14:34] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @crimsonharvest Not quite
[1:14:34] <SchroedingersFerret> Getting too greedy
[1:14:35] <%TheTakkster> Fuck no it is not the king of the orange goo gas
[1:14:35] <+Dimfish> this build will work tho
[1:14:39] <hntronium> Pat remember to heal
[1:14:39] <%stigna1> You know what sucks? The pop culture version of a thing is always more popular than the original thing so it gets eclipsed. Eventually, googling anything will just result in old movies and nothing useful.

[1:15:17] <$magikestral> do you have to jump for DD?
[1:15:18] <$Mendin> I forget: If you use the dive attack while on the ground, will it make you jump and stomp or must it be aerial?

[1:15:52] <%stigna1> @Mendin I think you have to be in the air to do it but I'm not sure.
[1:15:54] <@thenefftw> He can do it
[1:15:55] <+aerdus01> just beat the videya game
[1:15:57] <TakesGuts> you got this

[1:16:05] <+fizzguy47> Why is there a xenomorph nest
[1:16:06] <%crot45> hi nef
[1:16:07] <+SilasDrekken> Heal when you stun him for the love of god
[1:16:08] <%EvilWillYT> @Dimfish then Pat should be hella adept at healing!
[1:16:09] <DapperHatwell> This is just like Dunky's stream
[1:16:14] <$shadow1man9> Someday Pat will dodge the charge, someday
[1:16:16] <+Gorgen> Oberon can strip armor
[1:16:16] <devanmuse> Gotta stand still for 1-2 seconds to heal. Not a lot of opportunities to do that
[1:16:17] <%edwardskacz> you don't need to heal if you never get hit
[1:16:17] <+MonXara_Z> fart balloons!
[1:16:19] <%stigna1> THat's the hard part of this fight; the adds keep coming even during staggers so its hard to get heals in.
[1:16:21] <Kghaleon> There's a charm that lets you heal and move at the same time.
[1:16:23] <%lutefiiisk> I thought Soul Lard was hard, but he's turbo easy once you get to other bosses
[1:16:23] <+Dimfish> never heal
[1:16:24] <SirSmudgey> Heal you fucking madman
[1:16:26] <CptBritches> You can go for big ass DPS if you go for a magic build and just become a cannon
[1:16:27] <ShawnEXE> he has to heal when he's stunned but make sure the Adds are dead
[1:16:28] <$i_am_therydon> dig up

[1:16:49] <pennykettle_> You can always come back if you need pale ore or more hearts
[1:16:52] <KaiserMario> Guys I've got some ideas for the power behind Crazy Talk... What if it causes a forced Mandela Effect by switching realities (similar to Funny Valentine) thus, Pat isn't in fact wrong, he switches to a reality where he happens to be. In a sense, he'd be both right and wrong, depending on the activation of the stand
[1:16:53] <%superorangerobin> apatBig apatDab -age
[1:16:56] <+sourceofall> the parry hits him but it won't keep it from hitting you
[1:16:56] <$magikestral> this isn't a roadblock, its a detour
[1:16:57] <%BioApple> If you're going to use all your meter for magic then maybe go lifeblood build?
[1:17:02] <%stigna1> Yeah, the mothwing cloak does not have iframes.
[1:17:04] <ShawnEXE> nah this is an optional boss
[1:17:09] <NerevaRising> @crimsonharvest this is totally optional
[1:17:10] <%Mev852_> DO BIG NUMBER
[1:17:18] <strangelee> Oh dang, we're still on this boss
[1:17:18] <%stigna1> Well, he's gotta get the dreamnail juice from SOMEWHERE.
[1:17:19] <+aerdus01> lol
[1:17:20] <+th3madness> oh pat finally got the dream nail
[1:17:23] <SatansDick1> jump over the dashes and dash out of the jumps
[1:17:26] <+Dimfish> orange ghosts are the worst
[1:17:27] <crimsonharvest> yeah i know its optional, but woolie didnt know that and pat migth not
[1:17:27] <+drakthebest> Defender's crest eliminates the ghosts remember

[1:17:49] <$shadow1man9> Nevermind he'll never dodge the charge LUL

[1:20:39] <Etherealizer> What nail upgrade is he at right now? 2?
[1:20:39] <+Dimfish> he can beat it without being a smelly melee player tho
[1:20:43] <+sayaman012341> @AngriestPat ayyyyyyy I was literally just watching the vod from the other night when i thought i'd check to see if you were streaming
[1:20:44] <legendarysabertooth> How long has he been working on this boss
[1:20:45] <magmakhan3> 3
[1:20:45] <+Dimfish> no need for defenders crest
[1:20:45] <Hydrapissed> @AngriestPat can try ur spin attack for when u knock him down
[1:20:46] <Jontman42> Holy fuck chat shut the fuck up I know I'm yelling at a VOD but fuck
[1:20:46] <+aerdus01> 10 billion dead pats
[1:20:47] <%AbnormalVoid> very dan
[1:20:49] <%AbnormalVoid> k
[1:20:55] <ShawnEXE> yes let's remove an entire element to the boss fight
[1:20:58] <%stigna1> @chza Sorta; you can parry strikes by attacking at the same time as the attack, which gives you some Iframes. Its super hard though, and dodging usually works best.
[1:20:58] <%Spydurman> get fuq'ed
[1:21:00] <asbestosflavored> let pat play chat :/
[1:21:02] <Kghaleon> I think he can get the final nail upgrade anytime.
[1:21:04] <ShawnEXE> that's how we become big man
[1:21:05] <+Gorgen> oh yeah. he has a spin move
[1:21:06] <%Sam_Tzu> that dash is rought
[1:21:06] <CeaselessSlick> !uptime
[1:21:06] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 21m 8s.

[1:21:14] <DapperHatwell> Quick focus would help with that
[1:21:14] <+Grayhammatter> or more descending dark
[1:21:18] <chza> @stigna1 ohh ok thx
[1:21:21] <$magikestral> @angriestpat a good reason to use DD is that it has a lot of ini frames, plus i think you can do it on the ground
[1:21:27] <%stigna1> I gotchu fam. ^_^
[1:21:28] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Suplex9000 it'll be under connections and it should be there as a sub enabled chat

[1:21:33] <+Kazuhira4> This boss is Paige when she gets home to Pat buying a 1900 dollar card
[1:21:35] <$Mendin> He knows about DD
[1:21:41] <Gehtingsberg> D E F E N D E R S C R E S T
[1:21:47] <%Spydurman> he needs his minions back to kill the adds
[1:21:49] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat try Joni's blessing
[1:21:49] <+drakthebest> Note: Descending dark deals 60 damage, your hadouken deals 30, your nail hits deal 19.5
[1:21:51] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat use descendig dark more

[1:22:18] <SchroedingersFerret> Go towards him when he jumps so he goes over you.
[1:22:19] <+Dimfish> he gives like 400 essence so this fights super worth it
[1:22:20] <nexoosen> OH THIS GUY
[1:22:21] <$Mendin> Hey Mods, isn't there an R9K mode that keeps people from spamming that same thing over and over?

[1:22:36] <%Mev852_> Have you tried doing big number? Big numbers are good.
[1:22:38] <%Suplex9000> @ThatGuyfromMars Not seeing it
[1:22:41] <CptBritches> If you actually learned things then we wouldn't like you
[1:22:41] <+thewaifoo> is this the Dark Souls of Metroid? Kappa
[1:22:42] <%Suplex9000> Max's stream is there, tho
[1:22:46] <KaiserMario> Push Hollow Knight for SMASH?
[1:22:46] <+Onlysamfisher > maybe the little minions charm would be helpful
[1:22:48] <zafooru> just don't let your health drop to 0
[1:22:48] <chza> B I G D I C K E N E R G Y
[1:22:51] <+HyperionXV> This would probably be pretty easy if it wasn't for the adds just interupting anyu healing chance
[1:22:56] <nexoosen> thats every pat hollow knight stream though, better just check out green zone again
[1:22:59] <%Sam_Tzu> only the hugest numbers can solve this problem
[1:23:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Suplex9000 I'm sorry man, I dunno what to tell you
[1:23:07] <$Mendin> Shoot the cyberdemon until it dies
[1:23:08] <SafCar009> Spore Shroom + Vine charm is godly here, the ghosts are like no problem

[1:23:39] <zafooru> you have to avoid the enemy and its projectiles to win
[1:23:42] <+Gorgen> remember when he beat that one hard boss on his first try

[1:24:29] <%SuttonTM> ***
[1:24:32] <+drakthebest> Joni's blessing is NOT double health. It is 4 extra pips of blue and your whole bar turns blue
[1:24:32] <+Dimfish> @Prism_Wing he forgot he had it
[1:24:33] <%SuttonTM> Jebaited
[1:24:35] <%stigna1> @Prism_Wing Pat forgot about it. Its not great for this fight anyway; you need to stay mobile.
[1:24:39] <+drakthebest> They nerfed it a while back

[1:25:18] <%Mev852_> Better
[1:25:18] <CptBritches> This is payback for your minions cheesing the Soul Master

[1:25:33] <+drakthebest> Honestly if pat went winions they could probably shreck this boss
[1:25:39] <nexoosen> Did pat do off screen grinding again? a lot more health that i remember
[1:25:39] <Eresus> that was a good try
[1:25:43] <+kiiiirsten> First try no death speedrun
[1:25:44] <+fizzguy47> Do the Shoryu when he jumps Pat
[1:25:45] <%QueequegTheater> Pink Rathian is a massive cunt
[1:25:46] <Tisaric> yeah winions could be really good
[1:25:48] <+Dimfish> this boss makes me want to drink some Orange Crush TM
[1:25:59] <$RaikenTB> yep yep
[1:26:01] <asbestosflavored> yep
[1:26:02] <%stigna1> @nexoosen Nope, he put on a +HP charm. YOu can't really grind without progressing in Hollow Knight.
[1:26:03] <%SuttonTM> Dimfish or Sunkist rooVV
[1:26:03] <+QueenAtomica> gigzWHY
[1:26:03] <strangelee> so stop doing that
[1:26:05] <+AntithesisEK> there's a charm for that cantaThuree
[1:26:06] <zafooru> yeah walking into damage is bad to do
[1:26:06] <%Urgotfantasy> Hey pat, didnt know if you knew this already, but if you have trinkets that break on death, they wont break on this boss fight
[1:26:11] <thetechnicalraven> fuck I could use a glass bottled Fanta
[1:26:13] <DracusOmega> then use defenders crest to get rid of them
[1:26:16] <Zombrocom> @Urgotfantasy He is using them
[1:26:19] <asbestosflavored> it's a common problem
[1:26:24] <%Urgotfantasy> @zombrocom sick, cool
[1:26:26] <Gehtingsberg> Defenders chest
[1:26:28] <+TheShal> Pat takes damage when he's hit
[1:26:36] <%Urgotfantasy> just joined the stream so I wasnt sure
[1:26:36] <%stigna1> Yeah, the hardest thing about bosses for me was not an attack or anything, just the boss "repositioning" and ramming their fat body into my Vessel face.
[1:26:36] <pennykettle_> how
[1:26:40] <$magikestral> mods said to shut up about DC
[1:26:40] <Gehtingsberg> Crest*
[1:26:41] <nexoosen> Ahh, fair, and yeah, just last stream he'd done some grinding and bought out the shop so i was just curious :P
[1:26:43] <Endocrom> This is the one...!

[1:26:46] <%lutefiiisk> apatCrazy apatCrazy
[1:26:47] <%QueequegTheater> "Super worth it" immediately eats shit
[1:26:49] <%knota> the other half being running into attacks
[1:26:54] <Tisaric> yeah for as tight as the controls are it's kind of easy to find yourself running into attacks and enemies
[1:27:00] <Eresus> nice!

[1:28:31] <ShawnEXE> Wasn't that boss fucking fun as hell
[1:28:31] <arcaderabbit48> Essence is for specifically upgrading aspects of the Dream Nail. Don't know what ti actually upgrades though

[1:30:55] <Tisaric> STAG
[1:30:57] <Kghaleon> Yo Pat, you could technically upgrade to the best nail if you found the remaining pale ores.

[1:31:01] <+Camail> your welcome, dlc
[1:31:02] <%stigna1> @Mendin The Castle GROUNDS. :p

[1:31:12] <magmakhan3> oh i didnt know dlc added this
[1:31:13] <+Camail> this place used to be such a bitch to get to
[1:31:15] <+Dimfish> yeah there didnt used to be a station by the palace grounds
[1:31:16] <+jezred14> maybe
[1:31:17] <Sleepology> its not dlc
[1:31:17] <+Camail> hiddens tation
[1:31:19] <Eresus> just the station
[1:31:19] <+Kawaso> other side of platform is bench
[1:31:19] <%TheTakkster> This station is NOT dlc
[1:31:19] <%edwardskacz> hidden station
[1:31:21] <%stigna1> Just this subway station.
[1:31:21] <Tisaric> just the station
[1:31:21] <Pairoschuz> This station was added in DLC
[1:31:21] <+HyperionXV> free-lc
[1:31:22] <+AntithesisEK> yeah this station was patched in
[1:31:22] <$shadow1man9> Hidden Station
[1:31:22] <+Dimfish> the palace isnt just the station
[1:31:22] <+Bupkis7> station
[1:31:23] <SatansDick1> the white knight
[1:31:23] <%ArcanumMBD> the station is a QoL thing added along with a dlc
[1:31:23] <BakerBrute> hidden station is dlc
[1:31:24] <%Divryne> Station was DLC.
[1:31:24] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> nope
[1:31:26] <asbestosflavored> technically
[1:31:27] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> This station WAS patched in
[1:31:27] <Tisaric> The station was totally dlc
[1:31:27] <custoadian> it was patched in
[1:31:32] <%BioApple> The station was added in an update but it's not part of the DLC expansions @AngriestPat
[1:31:32] <+Ranmaru_Richu> Hidden Station added from Hidden Dreams, first DLC
[1:31:35] <pennykettle_> @Kghaleon technically you can upgrade your gear to if you have the requirements BrokeBack
[1:31:39] <$Tredecian> used to have to walk from the fucking city
[1:31:39] <+drakthebest> I mean, none of the DLC is really DLC. It's all a part of the base game
[1:31:39] <Etherealizer> man Stag is best boi
[1:31:40] <%QueequegTheater> Isn't this more like a QoL patch than actual DLC?
[1:31:43] <+Ranmaru_Richu> It was MUCH appreciated lol
[1:31:47] <magmakhan3> before you had to use kings station as closest to get down here
[1:31:51] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat mark the big timestop door
[1:31:52] <DracusOmega> mark the stupid door
[1:31:52] <haisho> forgot to dream nail the corpse in front of the palace but OH WELL

[1:33:28] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat Moon Presence flashbacks!
[1:33:29] <%ArcanumMBD> Doing a thing with a Dreamer will also cause it
[1:33:29] <ape_hawk> is this another 8 hour stream?
[1:33:29] <+ZebraFace> Killing vessel
[1:33:31] <+drakthebest> @AngriestPat You also get this if you kill one of the dreamers. It means the seal is weakening
[1:33:32] <+Quarkee> BIOCURSE
[1:33:32] <KayThree> ITS THE T VIRUS
[1:33:32] <asbestosflavored> Nature takes its course
[1:33:35] <@SSaryn> Welcome TO DIE.
[1:33:35] <%Sam_Tzu> the biocurse everywhere system caused this
[1:33:36] <Tisaric> T H E L I G H T
[1:33:41] <Pairoschuz> Nice job killing Rom the vacuous spider Pat
[1:33:43] <%stigna1> That angry creature was a Furious Vengefly "Vengefly whose body has been distorted by continued infection. Highly aggressive. The infection that passes from creature to creature grants strength and courage, but it also seems to enslave the will. Would you make such a bargain?"
[1:33:43] <%Mev852_> WHY?!
[1:33:44] <CptBritches> Umbrella unleashed their new virus
[1:33:44] <SatansDick1> the biocurse
[1:33:47] <magmakhan3> now that flower quest has gone from annoying to hellish
[1:33:55] <VolticSurgeSA> Oh no it's the Flood
[1:33:58] <deviljhojho94> WUH HAPPEN
[1:34:01] <%BioApple> i hope you don't mind pathways being blocked off and that not registering on your map
[1:34:02] <+fizzguy47> Good job breaking it, Hero!
[1:34:05] <+mydyingparadiselost> might wanna check out that ceiling...
[1:34:07] <+Dimfish> the tutorial level is now a difficult late game zone, welcome to the nightmare
[1:34:08] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat There's a breakable wall on the ceiling in the room before the Grub Father
[1:34:10] <$Tredecian> theres a dream tree above the room before grubdad
[1:34:10] <cutecheeks> Wesker teleported here
[1:34:10] <+drakthebest> Note: For the flower quest, you can just kill every single enemy on the way to the place without benching and then run it
[1:34:11] <RDJohnson519> it sucks NOW?
[1:34:12] <$Mendin> Yeah you killed Rom
[1:34:14] <+ZebraFace> Killing vessel started it
[1:34:14] <asbestosflavored> LUL
[1:34:16] <%PatNTheHat> At least these guys are okay
[1:34:19] <devanmuse> I'm guessing this is what was in the "Broken Vessel?"
[1:34:20] <SatansDick1> that smoked affect is cool
[1:34:21] <Tisaric> I fucking love when they do that to the beginning areas
[1:34:22] <haisho> Did you think IT WOULD BE THIS EASY?! TOO BAD, IT WAS ME BIOCURSE
[1:34:23] <+GuelermeDias> grubmos!
[1:34:24] <BakerBrute> You did a Rom situation here
[1:34:24] <DracusOmega> wa wa wa dub
[1:34:32] <bloodypurpledog> The whole world is suffering from Mono Orangosis
[1:34:33] <%TheTakkster> There are multiple triggers
[1:34:33] <$magikestral> you killed rom, essentially- this also happens when you kill a dreamer @angriestpat
[1:34:33] <Tisaric> It's such a good trope
[1:34:35] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat event flags are not necessarily lore
[1:34:36] <+th3madness> not quite no
[1:34:39] <Kghaleon> Think it happens after getting double jump

[1:35:35] <Tisaric> Oh my god I never found this
[1:35:36] <+MonXara_Z> nani?
[1:35:40] <+Dimfish> easier to see with biocurse juice around everywhere
[1:35:48] <Etherealizer> lol I dont think I ever found this
[1:35:52] <Tisaric> Oh my fucking god I'm still learning new shit
[1:35:57] <%umbypokochan> i never found this either o.o
[1:36:01] <+Dimfish> you should go back to the moth lady in the resting grounds and turn in your essence
[1:36:07] <+mydyingparadiselost> good job
[1:36:13] <magmakhan3> well that explains why my dream essence was at a weird number at the end of my game
[1:36:18] <+gantz_zero> what mistakes @AngriestPat
[1:36:18] <%Divryne> Nah you're good.
[1:36:18] <Endocrom> Unlocked the phason core
[1:36:27] <+th3madness> but were they your mistakes pat?
[1:36:41] <+Camail> dream nail the tree
[1:36:41] <%Divryne> Check out the Black Egg Temple.
[1:36:42] <$magikestral> moth time!
[1:36:45] <devanmuse> The whole world is now covered in evil magic curse goo. "Mistakes were made"
[1:36:49] <+drakthebest> Hey check out that giant black symbol at the top maybe
[1:36:51] <+fizzguy47> Hope that Woolie does a lore series of this game
[1:36:52] <%QueequegTheater> Nail the tree
[1:36:53] <+JustToWatch> SUPER fucked
[1:36:55] <%stigna1> Those little flying things are called VOlatile Gruzzers. "Gruzzer swollen with infection and primed to burst. Horrible goo and noxious gas has started leaking down from above. Is there a source of all this pestilence? If so, I haven't seen it."
[1:36:56] <Etherealizer> I still need about 400 for the achievement in my save but I got the dreamnail upgraded all the way
[1:36:57] <%umbypokochan> dream nail Elmo
[1:36:59] <$magikestral> oh yeah, the tree now has lore when you dream nail it @angriestpat
[1:37:02] <pennykettle_> Woolie isnt doing lore on this lol
[1:37:09] <Burpinator1> Biggest thing that sucks is there is Goo that just blocks a path that used to be open before
[1:37:16] <Tisaric> He still needs the true ending
[1:37:19] <SirSmudgey> Infects the whole world "Look, I never said I was perfect"
[1:37:28] <haisho> BIG BIOCURSE
[1:37:29] <Tisaric> YUP
[1:37:31] <$Tredecian> moth lady has pale ore
[1:37:31] <+Dimfish> YUP
[1:37:32] <%Divryne> PATH BLOCKED.
[1:37:32] <+Camail> oh yea, forgot that happened
[1:37:33] <Eresus> yep
[1:37:34] <+Dimfish> LAYOUTS ALL FUCKED NOW
[1:37:35] <Bendy_V> Scenic route
[1:37:35] <+MetaSla> time to go ALL THE WAY AROUND
[1:37:35] <%rdark_ksu> shit got bad
[1:37:36] <alwayspronking> YEYEYE BIOCURSE
[1:37:37] <BakerBrute> @AngriestPat This is what happened because you dug up stupid
[1:37:42] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat YOu can loop around the other side.
[1:37:42] <%Divryne> YEYEYE ENDING C.
[1:37:45] <+Dimfish> NEW ZONE LAYOUTS HALFWAY THROUGHT HE GAME LETS GO
[1:37:45] <Sleepology> its kind of awful !
[1:37:53] <%BioApple> might as well mark that so you don't keep running into it like I did
[1:37:53] <NerevaRising> the price of double jump
[1:37:57] <Tisaric> such a fucking good trope
[1:37:58] <ShawnEXE> It's to make you feel AWFUL
[1:37:59] <Burpinator1> Its stupid cause you can still access the whole area but at this point it just wants to make things stupidly tedious
[1:38:05] <%stigna1> Man, recontextialization is the best.
[1:38:09] <+gantz_zero> AOE
[1:38:11] <DracusOmega> you just need to drink the sarcophagus juces
[1:38:11] <+Dimfish> the price of X amount of progress, the world gets more fucked up the more progress you make
[1:38:12] <+Camail> AngriestPat you can dream nail the trees
[1:38:17] <+JustToWatch> GRUB
[1:38:18] <$Mendin> That's some good curse in that biocurse
[1:38:19] <CapCasual> GRUB!
[1:38:19] <SirSmudgey> You missed an elmo!
[1:38:19] <+Bouerd> There's a grub
[1:38:20] <Endocrom> Nice
[1:38:21] <pennykettle_> You gave the world lupus
[1:38:22] <+LuckyHitman> you just walked past a grub
[1:38:23] <%TheTakkster> there was an elmo back there!
[1:38:24] <Zanicedg> Missed grub.
[1:38:25] <+ryujinran> i like it when previous areas in games like these get changed but not when areas get blocked off
[1:38:25] <NerevaRising> blind pat is blind
[1:38:28] <ShawnEXE> ELMO
[1:38:32] <rossnwolf> guys I am a solid 16 hours behind
[1:38:34] <+drakthebest> @AngriestPat Your reward for collecting 300 essence is a pale ore so you can go collect that right now. You can also get your money back from banker lady right now
[1:38:35] <rossnwolf> what've I missed
[1:38:38] <CapCasual> E L M O
[1:38:39] <%Divryne> THE LIGHT.
[1:38:39] <+Camail> B R I G H T
[1:38:39] <Pairoschuz> I didn't like that movie
[1:38:41] <Tisaric> BRIGHT LIGHT
[1:38:42] <GodlyLuigi> they're crazy BECAUSE they're infected
[1:38:42] <+Dimfish> BLESSED LIGHT
[1:38:46] <$Mendin> PRAISE THE SUN
[1:38:47] <zal_silverfang> oh no Pat. they are ALL infected
[1:38:50] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The light is not good
[1:38:56] <$Tredecian> exploding corpse
[1:38:56] <SirSmudgey> Go back for the elmo
[1:38:56] <haisho> BIG SHINY EXPLODING BIOCURSE
[1:38:57] <Endocrom> Exploding buig
[1:38:57] <asbestosflavored> LUL
[1:38:59] <+gantz_zero> ceiling bird
[1:39:00] <BakerBrute> BIG BOOM
[1:39:00] <$shadow1man9> It's corpse blew up
[1:39:01] <Tisaric> L I G H T
[1:39:02] <$magikestral> the bug exploded
[1:39:05] <magmakhan3> corpse explosion into spikes
[1:39:08] <+Dimfish> its like anti dark souls, light is evil
[1:39:11] <zafooru> it'd be super embarrassing if he died in the first zone
[1:39:14] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Flying one are the worst
[1:39:15] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat just assume that everything here explodes on death
[1:39:16] <+ZebraFace> You're in the know, right?
[1:39:16] <+Dimfish> light brings horrible bio curse
[1:39:18] <+cant_pick_a_name> bright is pretty much that james caan movie where he's a cop and has an alien partner
[1:39:20] <+Dimfish> and makes everything shitty
[1:39:21] <%stigna1> The suicidal ones are called "Violent Husks" "Maddened by massive infection. Charges at enemies with no thought for its own preservation. The bugs of Hallownest were twisted out of shape by that ancient sickness. First they fell into deep slumber, then they awoke with broken minds, and then their bodies started to deform..."
[1:39:22] <%BioApple> @Dimfish frampt pls go
[1:39:22] <B_ikki> looking cool joker
[1:39:24] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> In Dark Souls, the light is evil
[1:39:34] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Gwyn is a dickbag
[1:39:35] <+Dimfish> well
[1:39:38] <KayThree> FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THE JEDI ARE EVIL
[1:39:39] <+gantz_zero> has he gone back to the bees yet?
[1:39:45] <+Dimfish> its not as evil as literal biocurse
[1:39:48] <%stigna1> @gantz_zero He found the hive, and noped out.
[1:39:50] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @KayThree This
[1:39:52] <+gantz_zero> cool
[1:39:58] <strangelee> yea man, that puss has been there the whole time
[1:40:00] <+fizzguy47> Why did ypu fuck the world up, Pat?
[1:40:00] <Tisaric> you have to go around
[1:40:02] <Kghaleon> There's still the arena.
[1:40:07] <+Dimfish> gwyn didnt turn the whole world into a weird cancerous mess hell
[1:40:13] <$Tredecian> shits biolocked
[1:40:14] <Pairoschuz> hungry hungry... hippos?
[1:40:16] <Parapattern> Not Hungry No Mo
[1:40:22] <pennykettle_> Yes he did @Dimfish
[1:40:25] <%QueequegTheater> @dimfish at least the biocurse isn't forcing all of humanity into willingly Uncle Tomming itself by relighting the Flame
[1:40:29] <$magikestral> @dimfish this is more akin to The Abyss, really
[1:40:33] <devanmuse> Gwyn's only crime was being afraid of the dark
[1:40:33] <Etherealizer> I think you have to go right and down to get around
[1:40:33] <%QueequegTheater> god, Gwyn is such a massive cunt
[1:40:36] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Okay fine in Dark Souls light is BAD but not quite evil
[1:40:43] <+JustToWatch> he dead
[1:40:48] <AtlasMcCoy> Aw shit how long has pat been hollow knighting?
[1:40:51] <%edwardskacz> Do you get the idea yet?
[1:40:52] <%Guidoanchovies> apatDab
[1:40:53] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I'm starting to think that maybe the light here is VERY evil
[1:40:55] <pennykettle_> wait wtf, you guys said "this is the opposite of Dark Souls, the light is evil" it was evil in DS too
[1:40:55] <Endocrom> Bio...luminescent curse
[1:40:58] <$Mendin> Keep on Praising that Sun
[1:40:59] <%Falilth> PAT WHY DID YOU BAD SOLAIRE ENDING EVERYONE
[1:41:04] <%QueequegTheater> @devanmuse and also arranging the rape-impregnation of his daughter

[1:41:16] <%Everpresent_Overseer> SEY
[1:41:16] <%cirdrag> oui
[1:41:17] <strangelee> it's plot
[1:41:18] <+th3madness> yeah stop asking questions
[1:41:19] <+Dimfish> it happens after a certain amount of progress
[1:41:19] <SafCar009> yes
[1:41:20] <$SGrim> Yes
[1:41:22] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> YOU'RE inevitable
[1:41:22] <ShawnEXE> yes
[1:41:28] <%stigna1> The light CANNOT be contained!
[1:41:29] <$magikestral> this happens when you kill a dreamer, too @angriestpat
[1:41:31] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> take that nerd
[1:41:33] <AtlasMcCoy> !uptime
[1:41:33] <KaiserMario> That beard is outrageous
[1:41:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 41m 35s.
[1:41:34] <Kghaleon> Woolie mentioned this during the podcast
[1:41:38] <$Mendin> Man if a game had this scale fuck-an-area that was OPTIONAL.
[1:41:43] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat there's a few triggers for it, you just happened to get the double jump first
[1:41:49] <$Mendin> I mean Nuking Megaton was a thing but this is beyond the pale
[1:41:52] <Zeemod155> Kreygasm
[1:41:52] <Etherealizer> heh, heh, dooties
[1:41:54] <%Divryne> SEX.
[1:41:56] <$magikestral> grubmother, after all
[1:41:57] <@SSaryn> Breed. apatWhat
[1:41:59] <Parapattern> @AngriestPat Shouldn't you use that plain key for some revenge?
[1:42:04] <+drakthebest> Same thing happens when you kill your first dreamer
[1:42:04] <%QueequegTheater> B R E E D
[1:42:14] <+gamerboy385> oh thank god hes not using the broken build anymore
[1:42:15] <+Dimfish> he could go to resting grounds and cash in his essence
[1:42:16] <%korth367> this place is fucked and infection is still going
[1:42:17] <Pairoschuz> Is that the dialogue you get when you hit Paige with the dream nail?
[1:42:17] <EMP_Ike_Turner> has it ever been more icky and pooey
[1:42:19] <linkwolf4> lytCANDY
[1:42:19] <%Divryne> Black Egg Temple?

[1:42:23] <+twohitgood> megaton was asking for it, though
[1:42:23] <@thenefftw> Oh, right, don't forget about Money Lady
[1:42:25] <%Mev852_> Nuking megaton is probably the best example
[1:42:26] <pennykettle_> Go take a shower
[1:42:28] <%Divryne> Check out the temple boy.
[1:42:28] <GodlyLuigi> imagine making a game where upgrade are collectibles, but the more you try to 100% the game, the worse your ending due to how long yo uspent getting all the shit
[1:42:32] <+th3madness> GO TO THE EGG
[1:42:34] <Tisaric> BANK TIME
[1:42:35] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat it would also be a great time to check out the grimm troupe corpse
[1:42:35] <$Tredecian> moth should have ore
[1:42:42] <Tisaric> GET YO MONEY
[1:42:47] <+drakthebest> Just go to the moth woman she'll give you a pale ore because you have 300 essence

[1:55:25] <$magikestral> @angriestpat "Can you feel the storm? its coming: zubug" that's what one of the graves says
[1:55:26] <+Bouerd> LUL
[1:55:27] <Jaller101514> only 1 per notworth
[1:55:27] <Burpinator1> Now do the rest

[1:55:28] <RDJohnson519> you got to parry him
[1:55:30] <AncelDeLambert> HAHA
[1:55:30] <+TeethMuncher> "You are tough"

[1:55:31] <%ArcanumMBD> he's drowning himself lmao
[1:55:32] <HawaiiAnthony> do souls remastered
[1:55:35] <marylittle5657> NOT WORTH
[1:55:36] <$Mendin> Draculas cannot cross running water
[1:55:38] <+Dimfish> HE GOT STUCK UNDER THE FLOR
[1:55:40] <AncelDeLambert> I never did this, no idea what's up
[1:55:40] <%knota> TWO HEARTS
[1:55:41] <Burpinator1> This is basically free Dream essenes
[1:55:46] <Burpinator1> essence
[1:55:49] <+paladinstarbuster> HA HA
[1:55:53] <%edwardskacz> he's invincible
[1:55:53] <element_of_loyalty> PJSalt
[1:55:53] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat There's a thing in the room nest to Moth Lady's along the left hand wall
[1:55:54] <$Tredecian> guard is invin eat all the other ones
[1:55:54] <Tisaric> It's like 30 it's not worth it
[1:55:54] <DapperHatwell> It is
[1:55:55] <+Bupkis7> THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
[1:55:55] <Pairoschuz> if he loses his geo to this....
[1:55:55] <ArrogantPrimate> totally deserved
[1:55:57] <Mariakko> It is
[1:55:57] <goddamndavid> 0 REACTIONS
[1:55:58] <@StridentSong> He can't be killed
[1:55:58] <+TeethMuncher> yeah
[1:55:59] <%BioApple> get fucked
[1:55:59] <%bootysteve> @AngriestPat You really wanna look at one of the ones in the backer room
[1:56:00] <+drakthebest> You nail the ghosts while running through the graveyard
[1:56:01] <+JustToWatch> THAT'S THE POINT
[1:56:02] <DapperHatwell> It's actually impossible
[1:56:02] <%AbnormalVoid> you get 1 per ghost, it's not worth it
[1:56:05] <asbestosflavored> it is impossible
[1:56:05] <+th3madness> so that's why you don't kill the ghosts for ONE ESSENCE PER GHOST
[1:56:06] <$Tredecian> eat the others first
[1:56:06] <aeonicvector> they are basicaclly paying you with souls
[1:56:07] <+shadowace2400> kill all the other ghosts
[1:56:07] <startstoprepeat> he only dies if you kill every other ghost in the room.
[1:56:08] <+drakthebest> You don't actually kill the guardian
[1:56:11] <Gehtingsberg> Nice going asshole
[1:56:12] <$magikestral> you have to do it over several runs, and you onlt get 1 essence each
[1:56:12] <Jaller101514> happens every time
[1:56:13] <+DontMindMee> oh he reset
[1:56:14] <%bootysteve> @AngriestPat Second floor, last one on the first platform on the left
[1:56:15] <%Urgotfantasy> Its super not worth unless you get some joy out of it
[1:56:17] <+Bupkis7> YOU ONLY GET ONE PER GHOST IT'S NOT WORTH IT
[1:56:17] <SatansDick1> you have to hit with dream nail
[1:56:17] <+silvery_cricket> Gotta soul steal and run
[1:56:18] <kvnmck94> hey, essence is essence man
[1:56:19] <CptBritches> You only get a single essence per ghost, it's not worth the trouble
[1:56:24] <%bootysteve> @AngriestPat right beside the hole
[1:56:31] <+Dimfish> YOU DIDNT GET YOUR GEO FIRST
[1:56:32] <+NWR_James> Ghost Dab
[1:56:33] <+Bouerd> a clean 1 essence
[1:56:35] <Tisaric> It's not worth it
[1:56:36] <ShawnEXE> PAT YOUR MONEY
[1:56:39] <marylittle5657> @AngriestPat it is you cannot harm him, you have to kill all other ghosts 1 at a time with him attacking you
[1:56:40] <element_of_loyalty> KILL ERM ALL
[1:56:41] <laserbeaming> When the game first released this didn't happen BTW
[1:56:43] <NerevaRising> there is a bossfight nearby that will give you a bunch of essence
[1:56:44] <Eresus> lol
[1:56:45] <%Nekemancer> Pat the monster
[1:56:45] <strangelee> 1 pip each
[1:56:47] <$Mendin> Genocide Route
[1:56:48] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> 1 essence
[1:56:48] <kvnmck94> ITS FREE MONEY U GUYZ
[1:56:49] <$magikestral> @angriestpat "Can you feel the storm? its coming: zubug" that's what one of the graves says.

[1:56:56] <asbestosflavored> DO IT
[1:56:57] <Tisaric> It's literally not even worth it
[1:56:58] <Kghaleon> Even if you kill all the ghosts, that's only 20 or so essence
[1:57:00] <%ECRead> you got pranked @AngriestPat
[1:57:01] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Cookie Girl double MURDERED
[1:57:05] <+Bupkis7> I FUCKING TOLD YOU
[1:57:05] <zal_silverfang> might aswell finish it now
[1:57:05] <+Robo_Wizard1> He warned you pat, he warned you about starting shit
[1:57:06] <%Urgotfantasy> Pat..
[1:57:08] <AtlasMcCoy> It's almost like you shouldnt have done that
[1:57:10] <magmakhan3> remember there is a hero's grave in this area real close by
[1:57:20] <+Dimfish> Theres a cool ghost boss downa dn to the left
[1:57:21] <%bootysteve> @AngriestPat Second floor of the secret room. First platform from the left. Last shrine
[1:57:21] <Gehtingsberg> Yeah you piece of shit
[1:57:23] <RDJohnson519> but its so fun to murder the ghosts
[1:57:24] <$Tredecian> what would pockets do pat?
[1:57:25] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat There's a thing in the room nest to Moth Lady's along the left hand wall
[1:57:25] <Burpinator1> Around the same essence that trees give
[1:57:26] <CptBritches> Unsubscribed!
[1:57:26] <+fizzguy47> You don't know what you messing with
[1:57:27] <zal_silverfang> finish what you started
[1:57:28] <+drakthebest> It actually isn't really worth it but I think if you kill them all and then also kill Xeno who's really close by you can upgrade again
[1:57:29] <%bootysteve> Aww he's not gonna geti t
[1:57:30] <+silvery_cricket> Pat your just ignoring that free essence
[1:57:32] <Gehtingsberg> Jk love ya <3
[1:57:33] <%Divryne> You need 2K for that.
[1:57:34] <kvnmck94> having trash OCs should be reason enough
[1:57:39] <Kghaleon> Final nail upgrade requires 3 ore
[1:57:39] <SatansDick1> is it possible to dream nail your own ghost
[1:57:40] <+drakthebest> Xeno is really easy
[1:57:43] <%Urgotfantasy> She just wanted to sell cookies
[1:57:43] <$magikestral> I'm just gonna let one of the mods tell pat the grave message
[1:57:46] <ShawnEXE> GET YOUR MONS
[1:57:47] <Zeemod155> Down and left tho
[1:57:52] <element_of_loyalty> So many charms
[1:57:57] <laserbeaming> Did he do the Dream Bosses? Those are the best way to get essence, also way too hard
[1:57:58] <+JustToWatch> You're really close to a warrior spirit
[1:58:04] <%Sirculbs> did he ever get his geo back from the bank?
[1:58:08] <$magikestral> @laserbeaming he did the lost kin
[1:58:09] <%BioApple> @laserbeaming just kin so far

[1:58:26] <AtlasMcCoy> @ValidVenasaur Murdered the ghosts in the glade

[2:06:58] <@StridentSong> She ain't Hornet. She ain't worth keeping arounds
[2:07:00] <%Agami23> they are "memories of the dead" so they arnt even souls of people.
[2:07:01] <%stigna1> So lets talk about what these remnants actually are. Its unclear if they're actually the spirits of the fallen or just lingering memories. The interpretation that I got was that its a shadow of a person, trapped forever in a delerium of their former lives. That makes it a mercy really, to let them go.
[2:07:02] <CrimsonCore90> yeet all day Pat
[2:07:06] <randomp141> If they did zombies wouldn't have worms
[2:07:10] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo wtf

[2:08:28] <+theGreatGoon > man i fucking love this song
[2:08:29] <%Higgsworth> God i love the intermission animation
[2:08:47] <element_of_loyalty> Can this song ever be replaced? I believe it cannot.
[2:08:55] <Kghaleon> how much did Pat talk about hollow knight during the podcast today?
[2:09:01] <$The_Esquana> Guys is it safe to say that league is dead right?
[2:09:02] <rustymcbusty> WE MEET AGAN PATBUG
[2:09:07] <%stigna1> I love the concept that a random plastic skeleton in someone's living room has become worthy of an animation.
[2:09:16] <randomp141> I wonder if Pat's ever gonna do a WOTS game on streams.... or if 4 was too scurry for hime.
[2:09:18] <+theGreatGoon > league is dead confirmed on pats stream
[2:09:26] <%Higgsworth> Plastic?
[2:09:33] <AtlasMcCoy> So apparently twitch prime is getting rid of ad-free viewing.
[2:09:36] <%stigna1> @Higgsworth At least, I assume its a plastic skelly.
[2:09:40] <%Sirculbs> @stigna1 you think skelmo is plastic?
[2:09:42] <+Gorgen> i thought it was liams skeleton?
[2:09:44] <%stigna1> Or is that what happened to liam? IDK.
[2:09:51] <AlasterAngelo> league of legends? that shits been dead since 2014
[2:09:52] <element_of_loyalty> Maskimal
[2:09:55] <+NWR_James> ELMO IS STARVING
[2:09:59] <%stigna1> @Gorgen Hekk, you're too fast, too quick.
[2:10:10] <%Higgsworth> Wrong. Its shadow man.
[2:10:13] <seamitten> did you ever grow anything, in the garden of your mind
[2:10:18] <randomp141> Skelmo was summoned by Pat's necromantic powers afforded to him after Woolie stole his pie.
[2:10:19] <$The_Esquana> @atlasmccoy why would they have ad free viewing when they could get an extra 5 dollars
[2:10:20] <+Gorgen> crikNinja
[2:10:22] <Gehtingsberg> Liam stream on @risingsuperstream

[2:12:23] <+sayaman012341> He doesnt look like that normally, he's just in a constant state of disappointment in Pat
[2:12:24] <+Gorgen> you could maybe with that $1900
[2:12:25] <+fizzguy47> Holy shit, TIL ZONE has been active for at least 13 years
[2:12:25] <Endocrom> Heh, Pat is wearing a Superman reference.
[2:12:32] <CptBritches> This is an Elmo stream. Pat is just riding on the coattails
[2:12:38] <+max_radical> is it weird that pat is my role model
[2:12:38] <%Sam_Tzu> see the video card is a business expense. if pat had it this wouldn't have happened
[2:12:40] <element_of_loyalty> Get drunk on the plane to Hawaii
[2:12:58] <tearsaurther> Come to WYOMiNG
[2:13:00] <%Divryne> LUL
[2:13:07] <element_of_loyalty> Canadians do not pay Taxes
[2:13:12] <%Agami23> its weird, because its actually a business purchase.
[2:13:22] <+Gorgen> Come to the Pacific Northwest and choke to death
[2:13:36] <%BioApple> if I launch a stream can I write off my PC as a business expense even if no one watches it
[2:13:40] <element_of_loyalty> Pat has a new fleshlight?
[2:13:44] <%stigna1> Yeah, he should be able to write that off. My cell phone is a business expense and I just use it for googling data real quick. I guess I do come from a clan of lawyers though.
[2:13:47] <C_S_N_G> Who do you call when you want some pepperoni?
[2:13:50] <element_of_loyalty> OWWWW
[2:13:55] <+Mikatonic> Has Pat said when/if he'll stream For Honor?
[2:13:55] <+sayaman012341> O O F
[2:14:05] <$magikestral> pat check Twitter to see the grave people wanted you to see @angriestpat
[2:14:11] <%stigna1> @BioApple You have to prove that the thing is your income source, so 'prolly not. If you can justify it making your real job better though, its fine. At least in Canada.
[2:14:12] <tearsaurther> Come to chicago and stay cuz you got murdered
[2:14:14] <%Agami23> a clan of lawyers is a badass way of putting it
[2:14:20] <%Sam_Tzu> yes the smoke is great out here on the west coast. feels like dying all damn day
[2:14:30] <$magikestral> from ZUBUG
[2:14:30] <pennykettle_> Zubug
[2:14:33] <element_of_loyalty> Pat gave birth to a kidney stone and named it Woolie
[2:14:41] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> 🤔
[2:14:45] <$Plutt_bug> Pat, when Siege?
[2:14:48] <%tiishi> apatDab
[2:14:54] <+Gorgen> someone here was walking around town in a pyramid head costume
[2:14:55] <element_of_loyalty> DABS

[2:15:04] <%stigna1> Aaahhhhh, I am released from my crushing need for him to see that. Whoooo.
[2:15:06] <%tiishi> apatDab apatDab yeet lol
[2:15:10] <CptBritches> Elmo is eternally adorable
[2:15:13] <+Dimfish> i cant wait for this stream to go on for like 9 hours

[2:15:13] <pennykettle_> @magikestral triLUL
[2:15:16] <nexoosen> Elmo was never not adorable

[2:15:48] <$Tredecian> has pat gone back to herrah?
[2:15:50] <pennykettle_> Theyre like the rich people in a neil breen film
[2:15:51] <$magikestral> pat you really should get the upgrade before you head up here
[2:15:54] <%stigna1> @Tredecian Nope!
[2:16:00] <$magikestral> @tredecian i believe people told him to wait for later bc lore
[2:16:03] <SirSmudgey> I always think those flying knights are shouting "BROTHA!"
[2:16:04] <element_of_loyalty> U P G R A D E
[2:16:08] <$Tredecian> ah kk
[2:16:12] <AtlasMcCoy> So pat, think you'll try goin for a high completion % for this game?
[2:16:16] <%stigna1> @magikestral Nah, he just didn't have the dream nail at that point.
[2:16:16] <$magikestral> pat get the nail upgrade first
[2:16:20] <+SirSamVimes> @magikestral imo telling streamers to not do shit until they've got higher upgrades is dumb
[2:16:20] <ValidVenasaur> he upgrade his nail yet?
[2:16:21] <+gantz_zero> @pennykettle_ i actually read that as "nail breen"
[2:16:25] <seamitten> @SirSmudgey SAME
[2:16:26] <%TheWhitestZangetsuYouKnow> Wow you got big.
[2:16:31] <pennykettle_> dream nail breen
[2:16:35] <+SirSamVimes> let him try it and decide for himself whether he's powerful enough
[2:16:38] <SatansDick1> 5k geo
[2:16:41] <%BioApple> what would neil breen say if dream nailed? I don't want to know
[2:17:07] <$magikestral> this area is pretty easy so i don't think geo is gonna go away
[2:17:08] <element_of_loyalty> CHEAT
[2:17:11] <$Tredecian> @SirSamVimes he has 5k
[2:17:19] <pennykettle_> He would be thinking about how powerful he is and how easily he could start and end wars with laptops
[2:17:20] <+Gorgen> "i cant believe you commited suicide."
[2:17:30] <AtlasMcCoy> Wait... does pat still not have the other TIME STOP?
[2:17:31] <damienlunas> Did Pat Mr. Shakedown Millibelle yet?
[2:17:31] <+QueenAtomica> @BioApple "needs more tuna"
[2:17:32] <SatansDick1> i cant wait for the new neil breen movie
[2:17:41] <pennykettle_> I cant believe you did this. how could you have done this? How could you have comitted suicide
[2:17:50] <$Plutt_bug> XXX YYY
[2:18:02] <element_of_loyalty> Pat has to learn what not to do.
[2:18:12] <marylittle5657> @AngriestPat where are you going? i thought you said you were going to get upgrades to spend money?
[2:18:16] <Parapattern> The bug portraits are a nice touch
[2:18:26] <marylittle5657> shortcut there!
[2:18:34] <+Gorgen> alot of fuckboi paintings
[2:18:39] <NerevaRising> watch him lose the 5k
[2:18:39] <$magikestral> pat turned around because he got scared of a long hallway
[2:18:46] <seamitten> short cut up!
[2:18:47] <pennykettle_> I cant be the only one that views all the bug royalty as sucking on baby pacifiers right?
[2:18:56] <Them00n> @AngriestPat Don't forget to throw 3000 geo in the well.
[2:19:11] <AtlasMcCoy> Hey dont kinkshame
[2:19:17] <Parapattern> @pennykettle_ Damn it, now I can't unsee it

[2:19:18] <%BioApple> rich people are weird
[2:19:20] <%stigna1> You know what's super cool about Hollow knight? Bugs, by default, have empty black eyes that fill with orange when infected. Most things have your eyes empty out when you get infected.
[2:19:20] <%Divryne> Shh it's fine.

[2:22:46] <+mydyingparadiselost> check the top of the battle arena before you go in

[2:24:51] <dekkitout> cruPF
[2:24:54] <+th3madness> why would you go die on the other side of the room
[2:24:55] <%stigna1> Descending dark is great in this fight, too. The iframes let people sneak by.
[2:24:55] <+Dimfish> try different charms
[2:24:57] <RDJohnson519> use your hadoken
[2:24:58] <+drakthebest> @AngriestPat You can kill one of those knights prematurely with the chandelier
[2:24:59] <+solipants> a little more patience maybe
[2:25:02] <+TsunamiPoro> oh no
[2:25:05] <marylittle5657> @AngriestPat go to shade lady then come back later?
[2:25:05] <element_of_loyalty> :d
[2:25:06] <cerberuscarmine> awww yeee

[2:25:09] <$TheNeedlesD> Dab the pain away, Pat
[2:25:09] <pennykettle_> no spoilers guys pls
[2:25:11] <damienlunas> Pogo-ing them to death works well IIRC
[2:25:11] <+drakthebest> @AngriestPat You can also descending dark for i-frames through the roll and damage, and also rancid egg
[2:25:14] <element_of_loyalty> Just the tip
[2:25:16] <+mydyingparadiselost> I see a ceiling in pats future
[2:25:16] <SatansDick1> you can kill one early before the fight starts
[2:25:17] <+gantz_zero> chandalier
[2:25:17] <Burpinator1> Pat should use Defenders Crest here Kappa
[2:25:18] <Nishi74> Us the dream nail to get soul really quickly pat
[2:25:20] <+fizzguy47> egg
[2:25:24] <DracusOmega> also try to use it for agroing and drawing out your gost
[2:25:24] <$magikestral> @angriestpat the dreamnail is kinda hard to hit these guys- might want to swap for grubsong
[2:25:27] <+drakthebest> rancid egg for free money back
[2:25:28] <AtlasMcCoy> It was a fantastic decision
[2:25:28] <7thnightingale> RANCID EGG
[2:25:31] <asbestosflavored> dream nail can charge soul on them while they're dormant
[2:25:31] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Breakable wall on the ceiling before the boss to kill one early
[2:25:32] <%stigna1> Pat should go to greenpath for this fight.
[2:25:34] <element_of_loyalty> <3 BREAK ABLE CEILING BEFORE BOSS BATTLE
[2:25:37] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you can dreamnail them before the fight starts, fyi
[2:25:37] <+drakthebest> So many things are being done wrong here
[2:25:44] <CptBritches> Pat, if you dab in real life during the fight you can kill them quickly
[2:25:45] <blacksoap65> @AngriestPat If you going to get hit alot, why not equip thorns
[2:25:50] <%Mev852_> Is rancid egg iike the rotten egg in RE5?
[2:25:56] <%BioApple> round 3 vs. the four belfry abyss watcher king gargoyles
[2:25:57] <%Agami23> that hitstop

[2:26:11] <pennykettle_> I used thorns and gas for this
[2:26:12] <%stigna1> @Mev852_ IDK what RE5 does, but here the eggs let you pull your souls to you.
[2:26:33] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> No
[2:26:34] <+Dimfish> its timed and death locked
[2:26:40] <NerevaRising> four kings baby
[2:26:40] <AtlasMcCoy> Do the nail length upgrades effect the spin to win?
[2:26:40] <CptBritches> It's both kinda
[2:26:41] <%theKittenhugs> DPS Race PogChamp
[2:26:44] <%Mev852_> In RE5 the rotten egg can Oneshot kill enemies, so no it's different

[2:30:43] <+MetaSla> use flukework shotgun for MASSIVE damage
[2:30:43] <%stigna1> Descending dark is great for getting out of being trapped against walls by their moves. It gives sick Iframes.
[2:30:45] <$Mendin> Rock them iframes
[2:30:53] <+Dimfish> stalward is helpful
[2:30:59] <+Jacknzack27> I was able to heal using baulder shell

[2:34:13] <%theKittenhugs> Instead of the flame dying like in Dark Souls, the flame in Hollow Knight turns into an unstoppable cancer, basically
[2:34:13] <damienlunas> You can still hit people, but you should pogo instead of spin attack because they have troulbe hitting above them
[2:34:15] <$magikestral> dreamnail the bugs beforehand to get soul
[2:34:19] <+Dimfish> @pennykettle_ I can only hope so
[2:34:19] <element_of_loyalty> Dusk to dawn Stream

[2:44:55] <tyrano191> Has he explored all of the sewers
[2:44:55] <CptBritches> Good observation Pat
[2:44:56] <grayjammer> Is it weird that I think Lemm's kinda handsome??
[2:44:58] <SatansDick1> dreamnail
[2:45:02] <%stigna1> @Rostichenburg Nah, he didn't have the required powerup when he got there.
[2:45:08] <AlasterAngelo> why is he called the hollow knight
[2:45:08] <juxtest> Give him the D
[2:45:10] <%Trekalone> He finally figured it out
[2:45:11] <marylittle5657> @grayjammer a little bit
[2:45:17] <startadevy> wwtvRIP
[2:45:18] <element_of_loyalty> Gweny
[2:45:19] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @AlasterAngelo Because he's hollow and he's a knight
[2:45:19] <+universefish> basically
[2:45:19] <Parapattern> Big Cover-ups
[2:45:25] <%Divryne> Almost.
[2:45:27] <SatansDick1> kinda yeah
[2:45:27] <%pennykettle_> Isnt it explicity said who the statue guy is?
[2:45:28] <%stigna1> The DS2 fanboy in me cries out in torment.
[2:45:30] <Eresus> yes
[2:45:31] <%Divryne> But basically yeah.
[2:45:31] <+Dimfish> perhaps something along that line of thought
[2:45:32] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Winnie the Pooh was a true mystery
[2:45:32] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> EVERYONE
[2:45:32] <AlasterAngelo> @Hunk_Of_Dunk why does he wear the mask
[2:45:35] <$Tredecian> pretty much the entire game is open to you now, like some sort of horrible insectile oyster analogue
[2:45:36] <%pennykettle_> ya

[2:45:38] <%stigna1> Yeee! YEEEEE

[2:45:46] <AtlasMcCoy> HE LEARNED A THING
[2:45:46] <grayjammer> Oooh he's gettin' it!!
[2:45:47] <CptBritches> Damn, Pat I think you may be a GENIUS
[2:45:47] <$Mendin> @AngriestPat There's one group of bugs you've fought that did NOT give off orange goo
[2:45:48] <BlindGato> We undead curse?
[2:45:51] <%Mev852_> Wow... I didn't even think of that
[2:45:51] <element_of_loyalty> <3 Enlightenment <3
[2:45:53] <%pennykettle_> Yea thats why normal citizens attack, they are infected
[2:45:54] <%stigna1> @Rostichenburg Of course. :)
[2:45:54] <Sulfazinum> exept mantis village
[2:45:54] <BakerBrute> ALL THE DOTS CONNECTING
[2:45:54] <nexus152> you should go to the corssroads
[2:45:54] <+Dimfish> the only enemies you've fought that havent were non-infected ones
[2:45:55] <ShawnEXE> BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MANTIS PAT
[2:45:58] <SirSmudgey> delicious Tang
[2:45:58] <+Dimfish> like dung defender
[2:46:00] <PhillipChanter> just what exactly IS this infection you should ask
[2:46:04] <Borealum_EX> insight gained
[2:46:06] <+G_Thunders> Infected with what, though
[2:46:08] <+Dimfish> the mantises arent infected either
[2:46:08] <SatansDick1> its a biocurse pat
[2:46:10] <juxtest> KILL THEM ALL LITTLE GHOST
[2:46:14] <Endocrom> I'm still going with phazon
[2:46:15] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> BIG thinker right there
[2:46:17] <Eresus> the light is very not good
[2:46:19] <nexus152> fuck has he gone back to the dung defenders area?
[2:46:22] <CptBritches> Shortcut achieve
[2:46:25] <BakerBrute> hes figureing some stuff out
[2:46:26] <element_of_loyalty> YEA HAW
[2:46:27] <tyrano191> no it is not
[2:46:27] <SatansDick1> youll find out
[2:46:27] <$magikestral> that's a good theory
[2:46:28] <marylittle5657> its not spores
[2:46:29] <AtlasMcCoy> Ting ting
[2:46:29] <%pennykettle_> ding ding
[2:46:29] <tyrano191> no
[2:46:30] <%stigna1> @nexus152 No, but he knows about the basement.

[2:46:30] <$Mendin> The light is perfectly good and cool
[2:46:33] <+Dimfish> he hasnt gone back to dung defender yet
[2:46:36] <SophisticatedDinosaur> like the blacksmith beetle
[2:46:39] <element_of_loyalty> RON JOE STENYA?
[2:46:40] <%stigna1> Ahh, ranjo stenja.
[2:46:40] <Pairoschuz> Varadel Akari
[2:46:42] <+mydyingparadiselost> Infection is what caused the happy miner bug to become an enemy
[2:46:42] <grayjammer> Ranjo Stenya...
[2:46:53] <AlasterAngelo> beetles can't grow beards he's clearly a fake
[2:46:54] <$Tredecian> someone left the refrigerator open all night and everyone lost their shit
[2:46:57] <%stigna1> @mydyingparadiselost Its a pity he missed out on her slow lapse into infection.
[2:46:58] <BakerBrute> new nail art hype!
[2:46:59] <$Plutt_bug> neat
[2:47:00] <Envy_the_spider> is knight the son of the king?

[2:47:54] <Futurecity10> Pat do you remember the well?
[2:47:55] <BestTeaMaker> There
[2:47:55] <Them00n> @AngriestPat Throw your money in the well before you lose it
[2:47:58] <%stigna1> Hey chat! The order Pat did things, he never got to see the miner girl slowly give in. Here's what she'd say if he did things in another order; "...Bury my body... c-cover my shell, What meaning in darkness? Yet here I remain... I'll wait here forever...till light blooms again... ...Bury... body... cover... shell, Darkness. No meaning... DANGEROUS... Still, remain... LIGHT.... again..."
[2:47:58] <$magikestral> we can get to the fountain, we can explore the elevator shaft from the spa area, there's some greenpath stuff- lots of things
[2:47:58] <reonome> Kappa
[2:47:59] <mr_slaide> Okay, this is cool and all, but it's no DEEP SPACE WAIFU.
[2:47:59] <grayjammer> There
[2:48:00] <element_of_loyalty> meow
[2:48:01] <Parapattern> THERE
[2:48:04] <Zanicedg> Greenpath is unfinished.
[2:48:06] <mr_slaide> Elmo is displeased!
[2:48:07] <element_of_loyalty> MIC THE MEOW
[2:48:08] <Eresus> @TheTakkster he did
[2:48:19] <%BioApple> @stigna1 Damn, I never got any of that either
[2:48:20] <$Plutt_bug> Mon Knight
[2:48:22] <ShawnEXE> fountain of money 3k?
[2:48:23] <%TheTakkster> cool.
[2:48:24] <%stigna1> And, when dream nailed, she'd say "... how much longer... KILL IT... how much longer... DANGEROUS... how much longer... KILL IT... how much longer... KILL THE EMPTY ONE... ...how much longer... must I dig...?"
[2:48:24] <+Gorgen> honk the kitty
[2:48:25] <asbestosflavored> theres still more to the sewers i think
[2:48:25] <CptBritches> Pat, you're just too smart for us
[2:48:27] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat You need 3 for the final upgrade
[2:48:30] <%pennykettle_> I just personally love kingdoms edge because its just vertical cap
[2:48:31] <SirSmudgey> could've just asked the blacksmith
[2:48:36] <$magikestral> the nailsmith rells you that
[2:48:45] <ArrogantPrimate> a word of warning with that last upgrade. Don't be too hasty after its done :D
[2:48:48] <$Plutt_bug> Go to level five and ask for directions
[2:48:50] <marylittle5657> don't check your map when theres enemies pat!
[2:48:51] <SatansDick1> go to howling cliff and use the dreamnail on the gorb statue
[2:49:05] <$Tredecian> you can throw money in the well to get rid of it
[2:49:07] <element_of_loyalty> BANZAI
[2:49:26] <CptBritches> Out fucking skilled
[2:49:27] <%stigna1> @BioApple If you go for the soul master first, before the crystal peak, she slowly lapses into sickness rather than going all out. I was lucky enough to see that on my run which really fleshed out the nature of the world to me.
[2:49:30] <element_of_loyalty> HE FELL ONTO THE SPIKES? :D
[2:49:31] <+MonXara_Z> lol
[2:49:34] <AtlasMcCoy> PAT GROW STRONK
[2:49:49] <+gantz_zero> Dreamy Dream Thing
[2:49:50] <$Plutt_bug> Flaunt your wealth like fucking Kiryu
[2:49:51] <CptBritches> Ah yes, the dreamy dream thing
[2:49:53] <%pennykettle_> dream song from sharkboy and lavagirl
[2:49:54] <marylittle5657> i don't really like how the corpses you can and cannot dream nail aren't clearly visually told
[2:49:59] <+Gorgen> Do bugs dream of Buggy sheep?
[2:50:12] <DracaenaLeaf> Is it bad if I were to get this game over S&S because of the art style?
[2:50:15] <element_of_loyalty> MURDER HANK
[2:50:15] <Kghaleon> There's still the false knight.
[2:50:17] <Rostichenburg> There is a buggy pig in the game so maybe
[2:50:19] <+Dimfish> he could murder Xero out in the resting grounds
[2:50:20] <SatansDick1> fight the failed champion
[2:50:22] <Crimpson> How are you enjoying Hollow Knight Pat?
[2:50:27] <+detbasil> wait so why is Soul Master sick before crystal peak @stigna1
[2:50:29] <grayjammer> Or another tree
[2:50:29] <TheEdrem> Murder big boi knight now you can double jump over his shockwaves
[2:50:30] <marylittle5657> LUL
[2:50:43] <startadevy> not murder!
[2:50:43] <tyrano191> fully upgraded nail and unbreakable strength is unstoppable
[2:50:43] <SophisticatedDinosaur> par dreams of electric sheep, and more souls games
[2:50:44] <Eresus> @DracaenaLeaf not bad at all, hollow knight is a good ass game
[2:50:49] <element_of_loyalty> Blow up DOLL
[2:50:51] <SophisticatedDinosaur> pat*

[2:50:54] <%pennykettle_> jermaJup3 triHYPERS jermaJup4
[2:50:55] <%BioApple> @detbasil event flags are not lore, they just represent natural time progression
[2:50:56] <DracusOmega> yeyeyeyeyeye failed champ
[2:50:58] <Rostichenburg> Soul master lived here and went crazy with soul. Myla presumably came here to mine crystals
[2:51:01] <element_of_loyalty> roof top
[2:51:04] <startadevy> keep drinking the orangina
[2:51:04] <ArrogantPrimate> if Pat thought Soul Master was easy, he should give him another go :D
[2:51:06] <Kghaleon> actually Pat hasn't fought many of the dream warriors.
[2:51:11] <$Mendin> *Any
[2:51:12] <startadevy> zekeBRO wwtvLUL
[2:51:16] <%pennykettle_> @ArrogantPrimate oh nooo
[2:51:18] <Pairoschuz> only lost kin
[2:51:21] <fillamar> Just got back from getting food. How many tries did watchers take?
[2:51:27] <Pairoschuz> oh, the graves never mind
[2:51:29] <element_of_loyalty> FUK YEA
[2:51:31] <%pennykettle_> @fillamar maybe 5?
[2:51:35] <Crimpson> The music in this game is just so soothing
[2:51:38] <AtlasMcCoy> The dream friends are real tough, they might take pat a while
[2:51:43] <startadevy> itmejpHYPE itmejpHYPE itmejpHYPE itmejpHYPE itmejpHYPE itmejpHYPE itmejpHYPE itmejpHYPE itmejpHYPE
[2:51:49] <ShawnEXE> try the soul master dream boss without winions :D
[2:51:50] <Rostichenburg> Go see Gorb the great mind
[2:51:50] <%stigna1> @detbasil Remember Myla, the miner girl? Her lapse into sickness happens as various stopgaps are removed through the kingdom and time passes. If you disrupt the crystal peak she goes straight into hollow-mode, but if you instead disrupt the soul sancrum's wards she fights it off a bit longer and has a moment of trying to be kind to you as her mind falls apart.
[2:51:53] <arcaderabbit48> @fillamar Less than you'd think, but more than you'd hope
[2:52:05] <Kghaleon> There's also Troupe dlc.
[2:52:11] <Endocrom> Bees?
[2:52:16] <@StridentSong> Pat knows about the Grimm DLC. He's saving it for later
[2:52:16] <Parapattern> I think aphids are the sheep of the bug world, since ants "farm raise" certain species.
[2:52:17] <%stigna1> I particularily love the "... how much longer... KILL IT... how much longer... DANGEROUS... how much longer... KILL IT... how much longer... KILL THE EMPTY ONE... "
[2:52:20] <$Mendin> Praise Gorb
[2:52:20] <%pennykettle_> @Crimpson it really is. I wish I could play just the soothing songs. I have the vinyl but it cuts into battle music and it feels a bit busy. It never lets you relax into the music
[2:52:24] <%Divryne> He missed the dream thing in Ancient Basin.
[2:52:25] <Them00n> Do the thing where you give all your money to the king @AngriestPat
[2:52:28] <fillamar> Not that bad. I assume he crushed that one eventually
[2:52:29] <tyrano191> troupe dlc is so hard
[2:52:29] <%Divryne> The palace.
[2:52:34] <element_of_loyalty> HEY BBW
[2:52:34] <asbestosflavored> dlc has a charm slot
[2:52:37] <CptBritches> Bretta a cute
[2:52:39] <+G_Thunders> Grimm dlc is to the left
[2:52:41] <ShawnEXE> Ancient Basin fountain too
[2:52:41] <+Dimfish> he could do the edge, he could do howling cliffs, he could hit up the resting grounds
[2:52:43] <Kghaleon> He's save time if he picked up the troupe stuff along the way.
[2:52:44] <%stigna1> God, that one boss in that one place is SO COOL.
[2:52:46] <grayjammer> OOOOOO
[2:52:46] <$magikestral> i suspect pat is gonna buy stuff from the upgrades
[2:52:48] <element_of_loyalty> KISS DA GIRL
[2:52:49] <TheEdrem> why greeed?
[2:52:49] <$Tredecian> @Divryne he cant palace for a long while
[2:52:51] <+SWindleFeD> Can somebody tell that quick travel bug to stop sounding like it's jerking off
[2:52:52] <startadevy> itmejpFTH itmejpFTH itmejpFTH
[2:52:53] <scrumdrew> pat you put on greed
[2:52:54] <nexoosen> FRAGILES
[2:52:55] <TheEdrem> wrong charm!
[2:52:58] <@StridentSong> Please don't mention content from the DLC's.
[2:52:59] <startadevy> itmejpFTA
[2:53:07] <epylepticpanda> True thicc bae is Cloth
[2:53:09] <@StridentSong> He will be doing it all eventually
[2:53:11] <SatansDick1> you put the wrong one pat
[2:53:13] <$magikestral> wrong charm, pat?
[2:53:18] <Envy_the_spider> you think the map guy is going to become hollow or did he kill him already?
[2:53:18] <element_of_loyalty> WRONG
[2:53:21] <Zanicedg> Where the hell is he going!?
[2:53:21] <TheEdrem> OH NO
[2:53:22] <BestTeaMaker> probably would recommend pat to do Kingdom's edge soon
[2:53:27] <ShawnEXE> Pat your charms
[2:53:27] <Crimpson> @pennykettle_ Just listen to the OST on Spotify
[2:53:28] <nexoosen> you have greed on
[2:53:31] <%BioApple> I cast my vote for Kingdom's Edge, the hive is the coolest area aesthetically and there's also the <redacted>
[2:53:38] <SatansDick1> heart

[2:53:49] <%Divryne> RIP charms.
[2:53:51] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Heart for dream fights
[2:53:53] <ArrogantPrimate> Kingdom's Edge is super rad, especially if he finds the fighting part
[2:53:54] <+Dimfish> heart unless you take just a fuckload of hits
[2:53:57] <%stigna1> Heart, but it can break.
[2:53:58] <%pennykettle_> @Crimpson ooh I didnt think of that. Im also waiting on warframe OST to go on there
[2:54:02] <%pennykettle_> LUL

[3:02:33] <$magikestral> @angriestpat fun fact, dream warrior fights have more health as you have more nail upgrades. They're the only enemies that scale
[3:02:34] <CptBritches> Now he's motivated
[3:02:34] <EMP_Ike_Turner> based Gorb

[3:04:09] <%stigna1> @fillamar He does not have any overarching goals; this is a sem-blind run (blind, save chat). I hope he does though. Oh, I hope.
[3:04:15] <%pennykettle_> theres also the spirit fight at cliffs
[3:04:16] <+SWindleFeD> Does the double jump refresh after a wall jump?

[3:06:18] <%stigna1> @Gorgen I've always been super interested in a livestream of the daily life of a squirrel or something.
[3:06:27] <%BioApple> @stigna1 kk, sorry if spoils but I haven't seen them so I figured they'd just be like lost kin

[3:06:58] <Shemegory> not open LUL
[3:06:58] <%stigna1> @BioApple No fears, no fears. You were very candid, its just that one of the mods specifically said that earlier and I don't want misunderstandings to pile up. :)
[3:06:59] <Tisaric> oh right

[3:07:18] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> fools
[3:07:19] <custoadian> he'd have to take the really long way around
[3:07:21] <asbestosflavored> Jebaited
[3:07:27] <%Trekalone> @AngriestPat You have to go the long way around first
[3:07:29] <cintra212> Dead End.
[3:07:29] <+Dimfish> gotta break it from the other side
[3:07:29] <%stigna1> "Time stop"
[3:07:32] <RDJohnson519> come back later
[3:07:37] <%Divryne> "Shortcut stop."
[3:07:41] <Parapattern> Get on our knees and pray...WE DON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN
[3:07:42] <$magikestral> @angriestpat you can access this area from the other side. The broken stag station can get you there
[3:07:43] <BakerBrute> JeBaited LUL FOOL LUL JeBaited
[3:07:53] <Tisaric> yeah might want to explore kingdom's edge wink wink
[3:08:13] <SatansDick1> go to howling cliff and fight gorb
[3:08:13] <%stigna1> I love those little moments of realization/forshadowing people get.
[3:08:20] <marylittle5657> you are so lucky that elevator didn't have spikes
[3:08:21] <$magikestral> kingdom's edge is good for your next area
[3:08:23] <$Tredecian> doma doma
[3:08:26] <fillamar> Do kingdoms edge
[3:08:28] <OmnipotentTrevor> Grimmchild is kinda handy for those shriek bats, I found.
[3:08:32] <+Dimfish> kingdoms edge has some of the coolest music in the game
[3:08:34] <Tisaric> kingdom's edge is a perfect next area
[3:08:36] <$magikestral> you can't do dung yet @angriestpat
[3:08:42] <$shadow1man9> He really needs to finish up the sewers first
[3:08:43] <Crimpson> You trying to parry him?
[3:08:45] <BakerBrute> good trades
[3:08:46] <$Mendin> Pat stop getting owned.
[3:08:48] <Rostichenburg> I don't think it does anyting yet
[3:08:49] <+JustToWatch> oh fuck he never explored the Grove
[3:08:50] <$magikestral> you have to beat all dreamers
[3:08:58] <nexoosen> you go anywhere you like pat, the world is your oyster
[3:09:03] <marylittle5657> parry is really unreliable
[3:09:19] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat If you strike a foe's strke you parry it and take no damage. Its very tight timing, but doable.
[3:09:27] <BakerBrute> Are we going to dream of shit
[3:09:38] <%mattmanj17> why fight when you can murder
[3:09:39] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat you should finish exploring the waterways
[3:09:43] <Tisaric> this is still for later
[3:09:45] <Rostichenburg> Not yet you need to beat the dreamers first
[3:09:48] <+Gorgen> what a shithole

[3:10:41] <$Mendin> @AngriestPat When you beat him, you pulled up the menu to read the charm too fast, you didn't see him fly into a ball of dung in the back and wriggle in
[3:10:42] <+detbasil> isn't he a dream fight?

[3:11:36] <SatansDick1> howling cliffs
[3:11:39] <ShawnEXE> you should finish exploring this place
[3:11:42] <asbestosflavored> that area at the bottom of the waterways
[3:11:44] <juxtest> Surrender your secrets poop
[3:11:46] <Borealum_EX> all the way to the right

[3:11:47] <fillamar> yeah yeah yeah
[3:11:47] <Shemegory> finish the S E W E R S
[3:11:47] <grayjammer> Waterways is good too
[3:11:49] <TranquilTurnip> Does this game make Pat say up too late?
[3:11:53] <Tisaric> waterways or edge are good
[3:11:53] <$Tredecian> sewer isnt finished
[3:11:55] <%Atomik456> Hey you missed some of the sewers too
[3:11:56] <+detbasil> I didn't know you acn talk to him. Is that after the dream fight?
[3:11:57] <asbestosflavored> you missed part on your map
[3:11:58] <%stigna1> @TranquilTurnip Yes,
[3:11:59] <nexoosen> Might be something you missed in greenpath?
[3:11:59] <Zanicedg> Finish the waterways.
[3:12:10] <%SneakyPenguin77> You cleared the wrong pin
[3:12:10] <%Divryne> !uptime
[3:12:10] <Rostichenburg> Follow that acid pipe
[3:12:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 12m 12s.
[3:12:23] <@thenefftw> Goddamn, I'm barely staying awake
[3:12:31] <+Dimfish> lol 3 hours, and pat said he was tired
[3:12:33] <Tisaric> you should have one on the palace grounds for later
[3:12:33] <+Dimfish> what a liar
[3:12:43] <$magikestral> @dimfish "the game is waking me up, oh noX
[3:12:50] <marylittle5657> you can finish part of the sewers from kingdom's edge
[3:12:52] <%BioApple> well that was before he snuck that red bull from the gym bottle Kappa
[3:12:56] <Rostichenburg> Palace grounds is very recognisable though
[3:12:57] <CptBritches> Being coated in shit is cool, though
[3:12:57] <Etherealizer> pat didn't lie it was crazy talk
[3:13:02] <$magikestral> shit eye gough is a STRONG name
[3:13:03] <Tisaric> yeah true
[3:13:11] <%bootysteve> Damnit shit eye gogh
[3:13:12] <Rostichenburg> He loves it though
[3:13:14] <%bootysteve> fucking got me
[3:13:14] <Tisaric> and there's the new stag station now
[3:13:15] <fillamar> No winions to protect you now
[3:13:22] <nexoosen> ayyyyy
[3:13:26] <marylittle5657> don't forget the hollow knight
[3:13:28] <ArrogantPrimate> it did not work permanently
[3:13:32] <$Mendin> Actually the shit seems to have worked
[3:13:33] <%Divryne> Parallel's with Dank Souls.
[3:13:33] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Regarding the no-damage-hit thing, if you strike a foe's strike you parry it and take no damage. Its hard to do, but can be handy.
[3:13:36] <$Mendin> For one guy, at least
[3:13:36] <Parapattern> Worked for a time, didn't it?
[3:13:39] <Rostichenburg> And the hollow knight sacrificed for it
[3:13:45] <tyrano191> It worked for awhile
[3:13:46] <medril07> the blood curse of byrgenwerth
[3:14:03] <%stigna1> Mmmm, coming back and 1-shotting dudes is the best feeling.
[3:14:04] <Shemegory> poisoned piss
[3:14:07] <Tisaric> panootsThink
[3:14:08] <EMP_Ike_Turner> look at all the stank coming off it
[3:14:09] <%Divryne> Acid.
[3:14:10] <fillamar> Worked for a while, but then the kind discovered his passion for saw blades and fucked off

[3:14:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 14m 15s.
[3:14:17] <SatansDick1> acid pat
[3:14:18] <tyrano191> But the flame eventually fades
[3:14:19] <+Gorgen> is this a Redbull factory?
[3:14:20] <$Tredecian> hint
[3:14:21] <Parapattern> Acid is stored in the balls
[3:14:21] <%Divryne> Hint hint
[3:14:22] <%bootysteve> The melee player charm has a lot of syngergies
[3:14:23] <Rostichenburg> Real Acid?
[3:14:24] <+edited156> IT'S A HINT
[3:14:25] <%Divryne> BIG HINT

[3:14:49] <+QuickSilver_357> rooPog
[3:14:59] <%stigna1> Man, the shortcuts in this game are so sick.
[3:15:00] <+DelNoche> pat I love you
[3:15:01] <custoadian> first time I did that, I panicked and canceled the dash into the spikes
[3:15:01] <+Dimfish> its just such smart design
[3:15:04] <Them00n> Not sure if Pat is dumb or just tired.
[3:15:08] <Etherealizer> I wonder why there are stones with bugsouls in them
[3:15:15] <Shemegory> stinky
[3:15:21] <%bootysteve> icky pooey
[3:15:22] <mayorrev> goodnight pat this was a good stream for my [B]irthday
[3:15:23] <Rostichenburg> Those stones predate everything for some reason
[3:15:24] <Tisaric> the shortcut porn is plentiful and always gratifying
[3:15:33] <nexoosen> that heartbeat sound gives me the fear whenever i hear it :<

[3:17:04] <$Tredecian> huge bitch
[3:17:05] <$Mendin> It's The Shitty Old Guy of Bloodborne
[3:17:11] <marylittle5657> "the eternal"
[3:17:13] <CptBritches> I wish she would bully me
[3:17:21] <+Dimfish> now get back down there
[3:17:26] <%Atomik456> AQnother weay into the city
[3:17:27] <%Divryne> Big shortcuts.
[3:17:28] <Rostichenburg> Nah this chick is fine she just hates everyone
[3:17:28] <Them00n> she ded
[3:17:30] <BakerBrute> She is what Pat will become
[3:17:31] <pectusumbra> so the flowers ward the infection it seems
[3:17:31] <marylittle5657> go back to sewer sign
[3:17:33] <$magikestral> now back to the shit with you
[3:17:36] <rossnwolf> I'm completely convinced opening that door is going to make her turn infected
[3:17:38] <%Atomik456> This was how I got in the first time
[3:17:42] <Tisaric> such a cool one since it's kind of implied 3d
[3:17:44] <SatansDick1> there was more down where you came
[3:17:44] <$Mendin> Back into the sewers where you belong patrick
[3:17:48] <%stigna1> To be fair, if all your conteporaries were doucenozzles you'd be happy to outlive them too.
[3:17:49] <marylittle5657> no she will remain fine
[3:17:51] <aeonicvector> She's a cutie (even if she's an asshole)
[3:17:51] <seamitten> I wonder what happens if you try to give this lady a flower
[3:18:05] <%rdark_ksu> aint it tho!
[3:18:07] <ArachnidX> yeah
[3:18:13] <Rostichenburg> Probably nothing
[3:18:16] <$magikestral> it was there, that's all why
[3:18:19] <Parapattern> @seamitten She'd probably spit in your face
[3:18:24] <SatansDick1> the dung defender
[3:18:31] <OmnipotentTrevor> This place would have been flooded if you didn't
[3:18:31] <%Atomik456> This area was full of acid bbefore you turned the pipes on
[3:18:36] <$Mendin> Shit is a good fertilizer, dontcha know
[3:18:37] <marylittle5657> jape nook
[3:18:37] <%stigna1> The acid-pump is sorta poorly designed; it solves a time stop BEFORE you reach the time stop in the first place so no-one who ever plays the game knows what it does.
[3:18:42] <Shemegory> Brother
[3:18:47] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat This place was filled with acid
[3:18:57] <grayjammer> Brava!
[3:19:03] <Pairoschuz> turning the valve drained the acid from where you are now
[3:19:05] <SatansDick1> time stop
[3:19:07] <Crimpson> Oh you haven't gotten that item back
[3:19:10] <+Dimfish> time stop
[3:19:10] <KayThree> TIME STOPPE
[3:19:11] <BestTeaMaker> more time stop
[3:19:15] <%BioApple> @stigna1 ironically, since I turned around after beating dung defender I was SUPER confused by this area
[3:19:16] <$magikestral> timestop
[3:19:18] <%Divryne> Keep exploring.
[3:19:19] <Endocrom> Varia suit
[3:19:20] <iwa5h4ck3d> Need acid stop
[3:19:23] <Crimpson> There is an item Pat that allows you to go into it without dying
[3:19:27] <crimsonharvest> you guys time stop is a great code word keep it up
[3:19:37] <$Mendin> Styling
[3:19:38] <OmnipotentTrevor> stigna1; It worked for me. the dung defender was one of the last bosses I found. I spent most of the game thinking that "prooving myself in combat" meant I need to beat the arena to get here
[3:19:40] <Tisaric> time stop is such a good term for spoiler stuff
[3:19:41] <%stigna1> @crimsonharvest Yeee. TIme stop is where it's at, folks.
[3:19:42] <$magikestral> never say the real thing, ALWAYS timestop
[3:19:44] <+QuickSilver_357> You need to get command to unlock that first lol aka Paige @endocrom
[3:19:46] <BakerBrute> @Crimpson We call this kind of item timestop instead of saying what it does
[3:19:49] <%stigna1> @OmnipotentTrevor Hah, fair enough.
[3:19:49] <fillamar> How did time stop start exactly?
[3:19:51] <%rdark_ksu> man pat has a tanky play stile
[3:19:53] <%rdark_ksu> style

[3:20:02] <%DedlokPM> @fillamar God of War LP
[3:20:03] <SatansDick1> @fillamar god of war
[3:20:07] <%Agami23> time start started because pat was bad at god of war
[3:20:10] <Rostichenburg> I beat the dung defender so early that by the time I got here I barely remembered the acid pump
[3:20:16] <%stigna1> @fillamar From the god of war playthrough; the guys kept thinking they needed a time stop to solve puzzles they were not figuring out.
[3:20:18] <Shemegory> that's isma
[3:20:18] <Crimpson> @BakerBrute Well aware of the joke. :p
[3:20:19] <$Tredecian> how many timestops can one man have?!

[3:21:02] <+oOZtkOo> grubber
[3:21:04] <nexoosen> when the new update comes out i am playing the shit out of this game again :D
[3:21:05] <+G_Thunders> There’s always time when you have time stop
[3:21:09] <Shemegory> do the mimics say something different when you nail them?
[3:21:11] <%BioApple> I forget but I THINK there's a secret in the flukemarm room that needed this @AngriestPat
[3:21:14] <@thenefftw> I have to go to sleep. If I don't, I'm going to fall asleep in a few minutes
[3:21:17] <TheEdrem> WHAT A SPLASH
[3:21:19] <+seriousink> oh hey, the bubble isn't around you anymore
[3:21:21] <Eresus> @Shemegory they sure do
[3:21:23] <marylittle5657> so i take it pat found the grub mimics?
[3:21:25] <Zanicedg> Go talk to dung man again.
[3:21:25] <Tisaric> yeah the mimics have typical light based stuff I think
[3:21:26] <%stigna1> @Shemegory Yup! They say "Empty...other.....Kill."
[3:21:27] <Rostichenburg> @Shemegory Yeah they talk about killing I think
[3:21:33] <Tisaric> or that
[3:21:36] <Hydrapissed> Flukemarm
[3:21:37] <+Camail> AngriestPat there's something you can do now near the snail shaman
[3:21:37] <%stigna1> Flukemarm.
[3:21:40] <EMP_Ike_Turner> root marm?
[3:21:47] <%Atomik456> Oh wow I never got that
[3:21:52] <Parapattern> Chastity and Root marm
[3:21:53] <golguin1> just arrived what's the update? how many Dreamers?
[3:21:54] <%Agami23> marm is such a bad word. it just feels bad to hear and say
[3:21:55] <AtlasMcCoy> Isnt that big lake also an acid lake?
[3:21:56] <marylittle5657> can do stuff in the greenpath lake too
[3:21:56] <+seriousink> oh no wait, the bubble's still there. weird, I must be seeing things
[3:21:57] <VeryTricky> They way he swims is cute
[3:22:00] <Magoloso> Remember the gigantic acid lake all the way back in the forest area @AngriestPat ?
[3:22:02] <%stigna1> @golguin1 Just the watcher.
[3:22:05] <+Dimfish> yes
[3:22:11] <SatansDick1> and in fog canyon or fungal wastses had acid you need to swim
[3:22:19] <%BioApple> Unn? Yeah but he might find that on his own again, flukemarm is just super out of the way
[3:22:19] <$Mendin> Oh yeah isn't there a huge-ass acid lake at the end of greenpath?
[3:22:20] <damienlunas> those guys aren't infected I just noticed
[3:22:20] <Rostichenburg> Was there acid down in Flukemarm I don't remember that
[3:22:22] <fillamar> Why does pats rising question voice sound british lately?
[3:22:24] <Tisaric> lots of acid places to explore
[3:22:26] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Remember when you didn't take damage? If you strike a foe's strike,you parry it.
[3:22:26] <EMP_Ike_Turner> LUL
[3:22:33] <marylittle5657> LUL
[3:22:33] <asbestosflavored> LUL
[3:22:36] <+QuickSilver_357> rooKek
[3:22:39] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> smart
[3:22:49] <%korth367> to hold them back
[3:22:53] <+oOZtkOo> really clear out those pores
[3:22:54] <Rostichenburg> Yeah Pat should go back to Green Path
[3:22:56] <Magoloso> cause they want to get high
[3:22:56] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's a sewer
[3:23:03] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat it's the opposite, pulling the switch pulled the acid out of that area
[3:23:04] <+Dimfish> i think its just sewage or leftover juice from the fungus world or the greenbath bayou
[3:23:04] <+oOZtkOo> exfoliate that shell
[3:23:05] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Sewers pump sewage
[3:23:06] <Parapattern> I think the worms are just naturally ass holes
[3:23:14] <%jiin6> Acid cause its nice
[3:23:16] <marylittle5657> no that just how they are naturally
[3:23:16] <golguin1> where is he being lead? Fog Canyon?
[3:23:18] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat go talk to the Dung Defender again now that you have the tear.
[3:23:18] <damienlunas> yeah they're not glowing
[3:23:24] <AtlasMcCoy> Lifeblood
[3:23:25] <Eresus> hidden dreams
[3:23:25] <Magoloso> lifeblood
[3:23:26] <+SirSamVimes> Hidden Dreams
[3:23:26] <tyrano191> No they just normal worms
[3:23:26] <%stigna1> @Parapattern Orange=infection. When corpses burst into orange, it means they were infected. The flukes were.
[3:23:27] <%Piemen99> !uptime
[3:23:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 23m 29s.
[3:23:28] <+Bupkis7> That’s natural
[3:23:28] <Tisaric> There's still like 5 or 6 more zones left at least
[3:23:29] <SatansDick1> hidden dreams
[3:23:29] <Zanicedg> Hidden Dreams.
[3:23:29] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Hidden dreams, then lifeblood
[3:23:30] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Lifeblood
[3:23:30] <%Divryne> Hidden Dreams.
[3:23:30] <BakerBrute> Hidden Dreams
[3:23:35] <nexus152> @Parapattern nah, they explode into orange goo when you kill them
[3:23:36] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat lake of unn
[3:23:36] <Eresus> yes
[3:23:37] <+Dimfish> yeah
[3:23:37] <+Bouerd> Yeah
[3:23:38] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Yeah
[3:23:38] <grayjammer> Hidden Dreams. Lifeblood was just a content patch
[3:23:39] <BakerBrute> yup
[3:23:39] <custoadian> pretty much
[3:23:40] <+SirSamVimes> @Hunk_Of_Dunk No, lifeblood was third
[3:23:42] <Magoloso> yup, mostly adding mechanics
[3:23:43] <Rostichenburg> Hidden Dreams
[3:23:46] <+Dimfish> grimm troupe is the one with a seperate story and questline
[3:23:47] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat first real dlc is grimm troupe
[3:23:47] <%stigna1> Yee, mostly. Some new mechanics.
[3:23:48] <Eresus> yep
[3:23:50] <fillamar> hidden dreams added bosses
[3:23:50] <marylittle5657> remade bosses
[3:23:52] <Rostichenburg> It added two bosses
[3:23:52] <$Tredecian> there was a path in fungal wastes across from creepy mantis that you can now open
[3:23:53] <BakerBrute> I love Grim Troupe
[3:23:55] <tyrano191> yeah
[3:23:55] <@StridentSong> Hidden Dreams, Grimm Troupe, and Lifeblood was the order
[3:23:58] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @SirSamVimes That's right, sorry. My memory's been a bit fuzzy lately.
[3:23:59] <%stigna1> Lifeblood also added a boss.
[3:24:00] <TakesGuts> now you can yes
[3:24:01] <AtlasMcCoy> ITS THESE GUYS AGAIN
[3:24:07] <Parapattern> Ahh, they seemed like predators to me
[3:24:07] <fillamar> lifeblood added small fixes, one small boss
[3:24:16] <@StridentSong> Hidden Dreams added the dream bosses, Grimm was additional content, and Lifeblood was the game overhaul
[3:24:19] <Rostichenburg> Hidden Dreams has a big DLC poster as well
[3:24:20] <SatansDick1> white palace
[3:24:22] <TheEdrem> GOD MASTER
[3:24:23] <grayjammer> Didn't lifeblood make nosk Not The Worst
[3:24:25] <%Divryne> Godmaster is a boss rush with story.
[3:24:33] <ValidVenasaur> You can do grim troupe now i think
[3:24:35] <%stigna1> @Rostichenburg They all did, and they are all gorgeous!
[3:24:35] <%Divryne> NO.
[3:24:36] <Rostichenburg> Gods and Glory
[3:24:36] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It added TWO dream bosses
[3:24:37] <+Camail> dream bosses were vanilla
[3:24:38] <fillamar> yeah, nosk used to be shit
[3:24:38] <Magoloso> Grimm Troupe is the hardest thing in the game, by far
[3:24:38] <%commanderclaw> Some of them were
[3:24:39] <%BioApple> Hidden Dreams added SOME dream bosses
[3:24:39] <Eresus> NO
[3:24:41] <+SirSamVimes> Hidden Dreams only added two of the dream bosses
[3:24:42] <$Mendin> Hidden Dreams added two Special Dream Bosses
[3:24:42] <+Dimfish> some of them were some of them werent
[3:24:45] <%stigna1> @StridentSong Just the "friendly" dream bosses; the rest are vanilla.
[3:24:47] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat Grimm troupe can be started at anytime, it requires you to go all over the map
[3:24:48] <nexoosen> Dreambosses were in the original, but extras were added in the dlc
[3:24:48] <BakerBrute> That guy is wrong it added TIME STOP BOSSES
[3:24:49] <$magikestral> it added 2, the rest were Kickstarter backers
[3:24:50] <%Divryne> They added extra dream bosses.
[3:24:50] <SatansDick1> no the dream bosses were in the game
[3:24:51] <tyrano191> lifeblood added a bunch of fixes and totally reworked one zone
[3:24:52] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> MORE dream bosses
[3:24:52] <Zanicedg> It added just two that you haven't found.
[3:24:52] <+SirSamVimes> Base game had three, Hidden Dreams added two
[3:24:55] <KoyaMusa> where is zote the hero?
[3:24:56] <Pairoschuz> added EXTRA dream bosses
[3:24:58] <marylittle5657> dream zote and dream defender are dlc
[3:24:58] <ValidVenasaur> It addede two dream bosses
[3:25:00] <Rostichenburg> They added two dream bosses
[3:25:05] <%Divryne> You fools word yourselves correctly.
[3:25:07] <BakerBrute> @KoyaMusa hes trapped in stopeed time
[3:25:12] <%stigna1> @OmnipotentTrevor Nay, no grimm troupe stuff yet.
[3:25:17] <+sayaman012341> so i'm strongly considering buying this game. It seems that all the DLC is free but what is Gods and Nightmares? Is it a paid DLC?
[3:25:19] <+QuickSilver_357> Is hornet stuff in the game yet? Haven’t been following the updates
[3:25:22] <golguin1> What's his nail upgrade?
[3:25:24] <$Mendin> Isn't backtracking throughout areas so much more convenient with twelve movement upgrades, Pat?
[3:25:29] <AtlasMcCoy> @sayaman012341 No its free too, coming out in 2 days
[3:25:29] <%BioApple> @sayaman012341 everything is free so far
[3:25:31] <fillamar> all free
[3:25:31] <+jjjkopf> you can literally see what each dlc adds on the title screen
[3:25:33] <+Dimfish> @sayaman012341 its all free
[3:25:34] <@StridentSong> Pat has not started Grimm yet. Please do not talk about ht DLC content
[3:25:35] <Magoloso> @sayaman012341 All past and future DLC will forever be free
[3:25:41] <$Tredecian> @sayaman012341 godmaster releases this weeka and its the last free dlc
[3:25:41] <%Agami23> how many bathmodads has pat got?
[3:25:42] <nexoosen> game is suuuper worth it
[3:25:44] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @sayaman012341 Godmaster will also be a free DLC. There will PROBABLY? be a paid DLC later that is a second campaign with a different character
[3:25:44] <Tisaric> @sayaman012341 everything so far is free and godmaster will be free, there might be paid dlc after godmaster
[3:25:45] <+oOZtkOo> these resurrecting worms are the actual worst
[3:25:47] <%stigna1> @sayaman012341 No, all DLC is free so far. Its likely that we'll see a paid expansion with another campaign but most is free.
[3:25:51] <custoadian> Gods & Nightmares is the dlc soundtrack, Godmaster is the next DLC
[3:25:52] <%BioApple> @sayaman012341 Gods and Nightmares is the name for the vinyl soundtrack
[3:25:52] <+Dimfish> @sayaman012341 they're leaving room for potential paid dlc in the future
[3:25:53] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Grub Literally Too Angry to Die
[3:25:57] <BestTeaMaker> yep
[3:25:57] <Rostichenburg> Gods and Glory is the last free DLC and then maybe a second playable character DLC which might be paid
[3:26:03] <%stigna1> Plus its 15$ so its a steal already.
[3:26:03] <+Dimfish> but the dlc so far is free
[3:26:10] <Zanicedg> Why did he come here?
[3:26:13] <Tisaric> I'm pretty sure they've said Hornet is probably going to be paid dlc
[3:26:14] <+MetaSla> Jebaited
[3:26:17] <%Divryne> There was one in fungal wasts.
[3:26:17] <seamitten> I want to play as Hornet, or maybe a grub
[3:26:18] <+Dimfish> he thought there was a secret
[3:26:18] <%stigna1> Haha, *laughs in bestiary*
[3:26:19] <asbestosflavored> Jebaited
[3:26:19] <+Dimfish> there wasnt
[3:26:20] <marylittle5657> the hell are you doing
[3:26:21] <TheEdrem> ya dun goofed
[3:26:22] <AtlasMcCoy> I remember there IS one in the sewers somewhere
[3:26:23] <+G_Thunders> It’s insane that this game only costs $15
[3:26:23] <grayjammer> Hornet DLC will be paid but nothing else
[3:26:25] <%Sirculbs> can you nail it?
[3:26:25] <Zanicedg> Go talk to DUNG!
[3:26:29] <iwa5h4ck3d> You can fight the dream dung defender
[3:26:31] <$Mendin> He just did
[3:26:33] <Magoloso> LIVE AND LEARN!!!!
[3:26:33] <SatansDick1> green path had some acid
[3:26:33] <+sayaman012341> @BioApple ah ok
[3:26:33] <%pennykettle_> Is this the best content to money ratio ever? @AngriestPat
[3:26:37] <Rostichenburg> I did read the full beastiary it takes like twenty minutes
[3:26:37] <%BioApple> That was all my fault but I did say I forgot
[3:26:37] <+Gorgen> !uptime
[3:26:37] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 26m 39s.
[3:26:39] <+gantz_zero> @grayjammer nah they confirmed it'll be free too the other day
[3:26:42] <EMP_Ike_Turner> I always liked Open Your Heart more
[3:26:43] <%stigna1> @Magoloso HANGING ON TO THE EDGE OF TOMORROW!
[3:26:43] <%Agami23> you went there so you could say flukemarm again
[3:26:44] <Rostichenburg> The acid lake was in Green Path
[3:26:44] <Tisaric> Yeah this game is worth so much more than 15 bucks
[3:26:48] <grayjammer> @gantz_zero OH SHIT
[3:26:50] <$Mendin> The fight you're talking about needs a Timestop
[3:26:53] <Magoloso> @pennykettle_ It may be. There is SO FUCKING MUCH
[3:26:56] <+ZebraFace> !uptime
[3:26:56] <Borealum_EX> hahaha
[3:26:58] <ArrogantPrimate> Live and Learn with Sonic?
[3:26:59] <TheMeromex> did you already backtraked to the begining of the game?
[3:27:06] <%Divryne> Now Kingdom's Edge?
[3:27:07] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat lake of unn my boi
[3:27:12] <+Dimfish> at 15 dollars theres no reason not to own this game
[3:27:13] <%stigna1> @TheMeromex It was, like, the second zone he visited. :p
[3:27:21] <nexoosen> Maybe greenpath?
[3:27:23] <zaiwolfgang> Kindoms edge
[3:27:28] <tyrano191> You can swim in sewers without tear greenpath is what needs it
[3:27:29] <+Dimfish> kingdoms edge is closer
[3:27:29] <Magoloso> I would gladly pay 60 bucks for this game, I love it
[3:27:34] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat Check out the Lake of Unn
[3:27:38] <+Dimfish> yeah i;d buy this game again if i could
[3:27:40] <Tisaric> I would've been happy if I paid 60 for this game
[3:27:45] <$Mendin> You can! For Switch!
[3:27:50] <+Dimfish> i dont own a switch
[3:27:53] <Tisaric> It's absolutely insane how much there is in this game
[3:27:56] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Rememeber that one time you got swing at and didn't take damage? WHen you strike a foe's strike as they make it, you parry it and take no damage from it. The timing is tight but it can be very helpful in a pinch.
[3:27:58] <$Mendin> Doesn't stop you!
[3:27:59] <AtlasMcCoy> Anything else to buy since you have lots of geo?
[3:27:59] <seamitten> absolutely would've paid $60 also
[3:28:01] <SatansDick1> greenpath has
[3:28:02] <nexoosen> O no, i realise i sugggested greenpath as a joke but people actually want him to go to greenpath now D:
[3:28:04] <SatansDick1> acid
[3:28:11] <valachi> Hey I want to play this game but It's the first PC game that I've played where I need to play it with a controller, any idea what I should use for Windows 10?
[3:28:16] <Zanicedg> Remove those pins.
[3:28:19] <Tisaric> greenpath actually has som stuff I think
[3:28:22] <SatansDick1> howling cliffs has a boss
[3:28:22] <grayjammer> You cleared the blue pin in the middle of crossroads
[3:28:27] <Magoloso> I'm actually saving for a switch and Hollow Boy is the first game I'm going to buy. i want to play it on the go
[3:28:27] <Rostichenburg> Green Path has acid stuff
[3:28:28] <%BioApple> The tear is mostly for greenpath but I'd still recommend edge
[3:28:29] <$Tredecian> greenpath is legit stuff
[3:28:33] <%BioApple> it's more new stuff
[3:28:34] <nexoosen> Valachi, controller is nice but you can totally play it with a keyboard
[3:28:34] <+Dimfish> @valachi use a dualshock 4 or an xbox360/one controller
[3:28:37] <%Sirculbs> Have you gone to the Lake of Umm?
[3:28:38] <+Dimfish> both have native support
[3:28:42] <fillamar> I would feel better paying 60 for this rather than octopath and I got over 40 hours in both
[3:28:43] <%Sirculbs> or whatever it is called
[3:28:43] <Eresus> yes
[3:28:43] <Tisaric> @valachi most controllers are fine, wired xbox360 is pretty common
[3:28:43] <Zanicedg> You've cleared sveral of these pins.
[3:28:44] <iwa5h4ck3d> @AngriestPat go to the ligma area
[3:28:45] <$shadow1man9> Yes
[3:28:45] <$magikestral> greenpath spikes is good for dash
[3:28:49] <%Divryne> Yes.
[3:28:51] <TheEdrem> you got exploding bees from it
[3:28:56] <custoadian> it was for crystal dashing, and led to the glowing womb
[3:28:57] <marylittle5657> that was charm
[3:28:58] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat there's a warroir's grave at howling cliffs you never marked
[3:29:03] <Magoloso> " @AngriestPat looking for places where he can do acid"
[3:29:04] <ValidVenasaur> thers a stagway pretty close to it
[3:29:06] <AtlasMcCoy> pat really loves greenpath doesnt he
[3:29:08] <Zanicedg> Go to green pathpath!
[3:29:09] <$magikestral> greenpath has some nice stuff
[3:29:09] <SatansDick1> go to green path now
[3:29:10] <golguin1> Pat are you aiming for Dreamers?
[3:29:12] <+Dimfish> kingdoms edge is close
[3:29:17] <Rostichenburg> Crystal Peak red pin and top of the mountain
[3:29:18] <DracusOmega> that fist area pin was that spike path thing
[3:29:19] <Tisaric> greenpath actually is a good place to go
[3:29:22] <fillamar> kingdoms edge!
[3:29:31] <%BioApple> be a big edgelord
[3:29:33] <valachi> Don't you need a 3rd party program that disables one of your usb ports to use a Dualshock 4 though?
[3:29:33] <sir_diesalot_> There is stuff to do literally everywhere
[3:29:37] <thetechnicalraven> Pat's still streaming? PogChamp
[3:29:38] <+Dimfish> edge! edge! edge of my dick!
[3:29:40] <TheMeromex> time to hard mode all bosses
[3:29:41] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat You can go to Deepnest and kill the Watcher you found there
[3:29:42] <$Mendin> I personally suggest the Howling Cliff's stuff
[3:29:43] <nexoosen> !uptime
[3:29:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 29m 46s.
[3:29:49] <thetechnicalraven> We're set for an 8 hour stream
[3:29:50] <$magikestral> greenpath stuff will help in kingdoms edge
[3:30:04] <valachi> If I remember right Windows 10 lets you just plug in a Xbox 360 controller and use it right away, right?
[3:30:20] <zal_silverfang> oh come now. pat wouldnt kill himself that hard for an 8 hour stream. i mean, he hasnt had his redbull break yet
[3:30:21] <+Dimfish> depends on the game but yes
[3:30:24] <Rostichenburg> Yeah there's also a nice build to kingdom's edge if you do a thing in greenpath
[3:30:24] <Mnightshyamallama> it worries me how not often Pat heals
[3:30:28] <SatansDick1> go to stone sanctuary in greenpath
[3:30:29] <+Dimfish> steam and this game both have native support
[3:30:30] <thetechnicalraven> What's the deathcount at now?
[3:30:30] <golguin1> Had Pat talked about how Hollow Knight is like the Souldborne series?
[3:30:31] <nexoosen> it's 8 am here in the uk, another 4 hours would kill me
[3:30:33] <+Dimfish> for the 360 controller
[3:30:36] <Tisaric> @valachi I think if you want wired dualshock you have to mess around a bit, but bluetooth is usually fine, wired 360 pads work completely as expected
[3:30:36] <ValidVenasaur> top of crystal peak?
[3:30:42] <grayjammer> Now to go wherever you choose to go
[3:30:47] <AtlasMcCoy> LUL
[3:30:51] <$Mendin> he and us have made a bit of that comparison from time to time, maybe
[3:30:52] <+Camail> you could do false knight dream boss probably
[3:30:53] <Rostichenburg> Green Path
[3:30:53] <fillamar> What
[3:30:53] <Magoloso> The first time I encountered a Mimic may be one of those videogame moments that will stick with me forever. I loved it
[3:30:56] <BakerBrute> Crystal Hype
[3:30:57] <asbestosflavored> there's also the option to go to bed
[3:31:07] <$magikestral> is pat doing the troll stuff again
[3:31:08] <%Divryne> The Hollowest Knight.
[3:31:12] <AtlasMcCoy> Check out grubby grandpa too

[3:31:32] <%Divryne> BURSTING WITH LIGHT.
[3:31:33] <Magoloso> @asbestosflavored maybe if you ARE A WEAK FOOL

[3:31:41] <Tisaric> big big infections
[3:31:43] <%stigna1> Hey, where did the "we truely have become the ____" even come from.

[3:31:58] <Rostichenburg> @stigna1 It's the last of us
[3:32:01] <%Basilias_Maximus> @valachi Xbox One and Switch controllers are easy plug n play, and just need a USB cable. ps4 controller needs extra software.
[3:32:01] <Crimpson> Look at your map Pat
[3:32:02] <$Mendin> You still must defeat Kraid and Ridley before you can enter Tourian
[3:32:05] <zal_silverfang> yes?
[3:32:12] <%BioApple> @stigna1 earliest i've seen was ATHF, but it was already a parody then
[3:32:13] <BakerBrute> whos to say
[3:32:13] <Magoloso> you could wake up Hera, you cleared her area already right?
[3:32:14] <+G_Thunders> Eh it’s not really important
[3:32:15] <ValidVenasaur> Does he have Up + B move?
[3:32:16] <$magikestral> who knows
[3:32:16] <+JustToWatch> Just breath in that biocurse
[3:32:18] <+Dimfish> maybe a bit of both?
[3:32:19] <$Mendin> Which came first, the biocurse or the egg?
[3:32:20] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Very carefully
[3:32:22] <SatansDick1> does it matter
[3:32:23] <Kghaleon> You found one of the dreamers already
[3:32:24] <asbestosflavored> 🤔
[3:32:24] <BakerBrute> Go to sleep dead then wake up alive
[3:32:25] <crimsonharvest> jesus shitting hell i just came back to the screen and what the fuck happened to the world

[3:32:33] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I don't think pat's gotten the scream, no

[3:32:35] <+oOZtkOo> ehhhhhh you know
[3:32:35] <grayjammer> It certainly happened is some sort of order
[3:32:36] <%DedlokPM> It came from time stop and infected time stop,

[3:34:21] <CptBritches> He mad
[3:34:22] <%stigna1> @crimsonharvest They seem to be bug-size. Some baddies are descirbed as single celled, and the largest viable single-celled organism (on earth, anyway) is in the league of bug-sized.
[3:34:26] <%DedlokPM> @TaliTenenbaum also look at the thoughts of some npcs too
[3:34:28] <+Stonehewer> This boss doesn't screw around
[3:34:29] <AtlasMcCoy> ???
[3:34:30] <Rostichenburg> Too fast for dreams
[3:34:31] <KoyaMusa> you have to hit them pat

[3:34:38] <+Camail> is his lazer bugged?
[3:34:40] <AtlasMcCoy> Why did he shoot himself?
[3:34:44] <Tisaric> I've never seen that
[3:34:44] <Crimpson> This game is just filled with so many bugs. hu hu hu
[3:34:46] <crimsonharvest> @stigna1 some amoebae are probably big enough to see right?

[3:34:48] <Rostichenburg> Oh that's a gub

[3:35:26] <grayjammer> Its hits for you are like a truck
[3:35:28] <asbestosflavored> giga slammed
[3:35:30] <zal_silverfang> wise ass
[3:35:30] <nexoosen> at least the run is nice
[3:35:30] <+MetaSla> probably a solid idea to jump away from the lasers
[3:35:30] <$magikestral> heal is only safe when he does the jumpstop, honestly
[3:35:31] <Endocrom> Mini lasers before damage lasers, Pat
[3:35:37] <medril07> you have to fight your souls to get them back?
[3:35:38] <nepwar> oh shit he unlocked the double jump

[3:35:54] <Tisaric> that exploit though
[3:35:57] <Magoloso> best thing that can happen is for him to get stuck in a loop
[3:35:58] <Crimpson> Right?
[3:36:02] <+Dimfish> he seems to be busted in that corner
[3:36:03] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The laser just has weird targeting if you're too close
[3:36:05] <Crimpson> I was like wait what?
[3:36:09] <Eresus> nice
[3:36:11] <%BioApple> i love that little gunslinger pose he does
[3:36:11] <+Dimfish> his AI doesnt want to aim outside the arena it seems
[3:36:11] <Tisaric> good shit
[3:36:14] <grayjammer> CASH MONEY
[3:36:15] <FrustratedAF> jesus another 3 hours on top of the 7 i've got backlogged. you're killing me, boivin
[3:36:15] <BakerBrute> Cyclone so good
[3:36:16] <%stigna1> @crimsonharvest Actually, the largest single-celled organism is an algae, I think. Its around 20 cm large, which is on the larger end of "bug"
[3:36:17] <Rostichenburg> It looks like that corner is just bugged
[3:36:18] <zal_silverfang> it seems the foreground object messes with the laser when he is close enough
[3:36:18] <+gantz_zero> some kind of weird aiming Kappa bug Kappa
[3:36:20] <+Dimfish> so instead it just aims backwards
[3:36:24] <Magoloso> ...it took me HOURS. HOOOOOOOURS
[3:36:25] <+oOZtkOo> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[3:36:29] <%SleazyShell> apatBig
[3:36:29] <SatansDick1> dreamnail
[3:36:32] <%Sirculbs> Naaaaaaiiiilllll
[3:36:32] <%stigna1> Crystal Guardian lore: "Heavyset miner of the Crystal Peak overcome by crystal growth. Can discharge blazing beams of light from its crystallised limbs. How does the world look to this creature, gazing out from within its crystal prison? Does it see only light? Is that what drives it into a frenzy?"
[3:36:35] <nepwar> damn all that geo
[3:36:35] <Shemegory> nail him
[3:36:41] <+Dimfish> that fight did take me like a good 5 aattempts
[3:36:44] <$magikestral> there's more to use with double jump in the peak, obviously
[3:36:50] <Crimpson> B) B)
[3:36:55] <Rostichenburg> Keep going up
[3:36:57] <Tisaric> there's quitea bit to explore
[3:36:58] <$Mendin> Big Ups
[3:36:58] <%BioApple> Pat go UP
[3:36:59] <+gantz_zero> remove pin?
[3:37:01] <+Dimfish> yeah the whole upper half of the peak is opened up now
[3:37:10] <$i_am_therydon> dig up literally
[3:37:18] <Tisaric> I love this area
[3:37:23] <Magoloso> are you going to do the bullshit no-hit flower quest?
[3:37:26] <%stigna1> @Tisaric The music is soooo good.
[3:37:32] <%Sirculbs> Can you dreamnail the lazer things?
[3:37:34] <+oOZtkOo> so did pat consider the minions too broken and stopped using them?
[3:37:40] <15zelda1> pat its 2:30 go to bed!!!
[3:37:43] <crimsonharvest> upspark when?
[3:37:45] <Tisaric> The battle music with the machines is perfect @stigna1
[3:37:46] <+Dimfish> not quite
[3:37:50] <Crimpson> You go down
[3:37:51] <AtlasMcCoy> Nowhere but up up up at Bug Co.
[3:37:52] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> That's not a thing
[3:37:54] <Rostichenburg> I think Pat likes to hit things
[3:37:55] <tyrano191> has he killed any of the little pink laser enemies
[3:37:55] <grayjammer> @Magoloso he cant even access the finish line yet
[3:37:56] <+Dimfish> thats a drop
[3:37:57] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Probably?
[3:37:57] <marylittle5657> cant get up there
[3:37:59] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's probably not a thing
[3:38:01] <$shadow1man9> That's a drop
[3:38:02] <Zanicedg> East.
[3:38:05] <%Divryne> Other way.
[3:38:06] <$magikestral> go left for other ups
[3:38:09] <%stigna1> Haha, its time stop.
[3:38:10] <%DedlokPM> Weast
[3:38:12] <cintra212> Go right, then up.
[3:38:19] <Rostichenburg> Other way Pat
[3:38:29] <$magikestral> new enemy hype
[3:38:29] <Borealum_EX> right
[3:38:33] <Magoloso> @grayjammer true.
[3:38:44] <Rostichenburg> Keep jumping
[3:38:54] <nexoosen> I kinda get the big "go to this place across the map" but when its a large door a room away in the direction he's headed...
[3:38:59] <%Mev852_> Is this a DLC area?
[3:38:59] <crimsonharvest> THis is giving me kind of a Donwwell vibe
[3:39:02] <%stigna1> Crystalized husk lore "Remains of a bug who died amongst the crystals. Animated by a strange force, it attacks by firing beams of light from its crystallised arms. The is some strange power hidden in the crystals that grow up there in the peaks. They gleam and glow in the darkness, a bright point of searing heat in each one. They sing too, if you listen. Very softly..." :*(
[3:39:03] <%Divryne> No.
[3:39:06] <crimsonharvest> wiht the bouncing off stuff
[3:39:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @Mev852_ Nope
[3:39:06] <Endocrom> Hit the tree so you don't have to back track so much
[3:39:07] <%Divryne> None of this is DLC.
[3:39:08] <+Gorgodrn> @Mev852_ No
[3:39:09] <Magoloso> giving up your mind for a crystal laserbeam does not sound that bad really
[3:39:17] <$Mendin> It's Seathe the Scaleless' spooge like it always is
[3:39:26] <BestTeaMaker> is this the bug version of woolie
[3:39:27] <%BioApple> Woolie selling out all bugkind for a raygun
[3:39:28] <Rostichenburg> Crystals refract light is the best you get
[3:39:28] <%stigna1> Their dream nail dialog is "...Dig... Kill... Wealth... ...Crystal... Light... ...Mind...Bright... Must find, more light..."
[3:39:33] <+Gorgodrn> @Mev852_ The DLC takes place in its entirety in the main world. It's integrated
[3:39:34] <Eresus> 99.9% of the game is not dlc
[3:39:39] <Tisaric> There's very little in terms of DLC areas
[3:39:40] <%Mev852_> Ok
[3:39:43] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I'd sell out all you fuckers for a gohadouken
[3:39:45] <EMP_Ike_Turner> remember that time Seath was a bitch
[3:39:52] <valachi> So what's the bug that 4chan wants to fuck?
[3:39:56] <Rostichenburg> That's not true the DLC has it's own completion percentage
[3:40:00] <$Mendin> There's at least two
[3:40:02] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @valachi There's a few, be more specific
[3:40:03] <$Mendin> In t heory
[3:40:04] <+oOZtkOo> sell your bug friends out to the infection for crystal lasers
[3:40:04] <nexoosen> @valachi all of them
[3:40:05] <%stigna1> Yeah, honestly, "DLC" for this game is a bit of a misnomer. They really should be "big patches."
[3:40:07] <valachi> It's the one that looks like the main character if I remember right
[3:40:10] <valachi> Except taller
[3:40:15] <%stigna1> @valachi Hornet?
[3:40:17] <Rostichenburg> so 100% of the game is not DLC but about 6-7% on top of that is
[3:40:19] <valachi> Yeah that one
[3:40:20] <$Mendin> Hornet but probably also Baps-anada
[3:40:20] <Magoloso> how does it feeeeeeel soul master? to be a biiitch?
[3:40:28] <%stigna1> To be fair, hornet is best girl.
[3:40:28] <+Camail> NAIL THE TREE
[3:40:30] <Tisaric> Hornet is vergil waifu material;
[3:40:33] <%stigna1> But yeah, bapanada.
[3:40:34] <RDJohnson519> nail the trees!!
[3:40:36] <valachi> Every time they talk about this game someone brings up wanting to fuck Hornet
[3:40:39] <+Dimfish> all things considered
[3:40:41] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Hornet _is_ best girl
[3:40:43] <ValidVenasaur> yea

[3:42:51] <damienlunas> rancid egg imo
[3:42:51] <%commanderclaw> Use rancid egg
[3:42:56] <+JustToWatch> you're super close to the confessor
[3:42:58] <juxtest> Top then
[3:42:58] <SirSmudgey> Defeats bosses left and right, can't traverse a small tunnel
[3:42:59] <nexoosen> and you can just shade to kill the dude
[3:43:01] <Tisaric> he still needs to explore here though
[3:43:02] <DatAsuna> @valachi Miyabi bst girl fo sho
[3:43:09] <%BioApple> but what if he NEEDS those eggs during the final boss? Kappa
[3:43:19] <Zanicedg> Who wants to bet on Pat's final death count?
[3:43:20] <Rostichenburg> Nah just keep going up what a waste to go back to town only to come back to here
[3:43:28] <+oOZtkOo> has he used a rancid egg even once yet?
[3:43:29] <Tisaric> if he's exploring anyway it's a waste to use the egg
[3:43:33] <Shemegory> When I went here on switch, I went through but the floor didn't break
[3:43:34] <Tisaric> I think he used it once
[3:43:40] <Rostichenburg> Yeah he used a rancid egg for something
[3:43:44] <+oOZtkOo> they sure give you a lot of those
[3:43:45] <Zanicedg> I'll put it at 130-ish
[3:43:51] <AtlasMcCoy> I never used an egg a single time, pat's fine not using them.
[3:43:53] <+Dimfish> @Zanicedg triple digits at the least
[3:43:55] <%BioApple> @Shemegory you need to break it on purpose with timestop
[3:44:00] <damienlunas> Pat's almost got all the time stops hasn't he
[3:44:04] <Eresus> to be honest, using rancid eggs is very inconvenient, you need to go back to town
[3:44:04] <+Dimfish> im guessing higher than 200
[3:44:12] <+Dimfish> but no higher than 300
[3:44:13] <nexoosen> high triple with the white timestop area
[3:44:15] <nexus152> it really depends on what ending he does plus what optional bosses he fights. cuz FUCK two bosses in particular
[3:44:19] <Tisaric> The eggs are for bosses you don't feel like getting to at the moment
[3:44:21] <nexoosen> Well, high 100's
[3:44:24] <crimsonharvest> ezpz
[3:44:27] <Tisaric> and you died to
[3:44:32] <zal_silverfang> secret in that room pat
[3:44:33] <Eresus> lol
[3:44:33] <%BioApple> LUL
[3:44:34] <Zanicedg> @Dimfish 200? He's not that bad is he?
[3:44:36] <Rostichenburg> Pat's good enough to do pretty much all the optional bosses
[3:44:37] <+oOZtkOo> LUL
[3:44:37] <+SergeEXE> LUL
[3:44:42] <+Dimfish> @nexus152 he'll probably do both endings since this game doesnt erase your save like bloodborne
[3:44:44] <crimsonharvest> e...ezpz...
[3:44:48] <KayThree> why doesnt pat ever seem to dash?
[3:44:49] <+Dimfish> and both endings are in the same room
[3:44:54] <+Dimfish> both major ones anyhow
[3:44:59] <Rostichenburg> @Dimfish There's three endings though
[3:44:59] <%Spydurman> problem solved
[3:45:00] <damienlunas> @Rostichenburg still would be good to get the black timestop before fighting some of them
[3:45:03] <zal_silverfang> wait. what does bloodborne do?
[3:45:15] <nexus152> true, enough
[3:45:15] <Tisaric> bloodborne forces you into NG+
[3:45:21] <cerberuscarmine> i think pat is tired
[3:45:23] <+Dimfish> bloodborne kicks you into new game plus after yhou fight the final boss
[3:45:25] <Tisaric> so you have to re-beat the game
[3:45:29] <+gantz_zero> nonconsentual NG+
[3:45:31] <nexus152> OH, also the fun area that changes what game your playing. that one will be a real bitch I think
[3:45:31] <AtlasMcCoy> Like all souls games
[3:45:36] <$Tredecian> @zal_silverfang bloodborne shows you the ending cinematic then loads into ng+
[3:45:38] <+JustToWatch> up
[3:45:42] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Nonconsensual NG+ huh
[3:45:48] <%DedlokPM> @atlas DS2 doesn't as I recall
[3:45:49] <valachi> Sounds hot
[3:45:49] <+Dimfish> @nexus152 you mean PoP, right?
[3:45:52] <SatansDick1> just like all souls games
[3:45:55] <nexus152> yes
[3:45:55] <zal_silverfang> oh, jesus. scared me there guys. thought there was literal erasing going on
[3:46:00] <+darthriven501> yo its almost midnight on the west coast isn't it bedtime?
[3:46:05] <+Dimfish> PoP is a true hellish nightmare
[3:46:09] <+darthriven501> pat
[3:46:14] <nepwar> does dreamnail work on the dick statues?
[3:46:16] <asbestosflavored> PoP is my favorite
[3:46:16] <Tisaric> Pat has succumbed to the Hollow Knight addiction
[3:46:17] <valachi> Reminder that people who have played Bloodborne and prefer Maria to the Doll have bad taste
[3:46:17] <RantingRavager> It's like 3am pat time isn't it?
[3:46:18] <AtlasMcCoy> @darthriven501 More like time to wake up
[3:46:19] <nexus152> I actually realy liked it, just not what I was expecting from hollow knight
[3:46:20] <%BioApple> Quarter to three in patland, that's nothing
[3:46:21] <Rostichenburg> I don't think I found that one
[3:46:21] <$magikestral> Pat won't go to bed until 6 am
[3:46:22] <Tisaric> I went through the same thign
[3:46:34] <+gantz_zero> @darthriven501 streamers don't have bedtimes
[3:46:39] <+darthriven501> oof
[3:46:42] <$magikestral> i neglected eating breakfast and lunch because of this game on my first playthrough
[3:46:43] <+Dimfish> well this game technically has 3 major end game super hard tests for the player if they want it
[3:46:47] <Tisaric> this game is super fucking addicting and you just want to keep exploring
[3:46:50] <+Dimfish> PoP is one of them
[3:46:57] <+Dimfish> and it tests the thing pats worst at
[3:47:00] <Rostichenburg> So many hidden walls and I went through this game with a fine toothed comb
[3:47:00] <+Dimfish> platforming
[3:47:00] <BakerBrute> AMAZING VIEW AHEAD
[3:47:02] <Borealum_EX> descending dark has such a cool animation I can't get over it
[3:47:08] <zal_silverfang> i mean, to be fair. are any of us any better? a number of us are up much later in some cases
[3:47:18] <crimsonharvest> hey you guys remember legacy of the wizard? who'd have thought we'd end up here.

[3:53:14] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> There is no right to the crystal peaks
[3:53:15] <Crimpson> The only thing up there is a the Pale Ore
[3:53:23] <nexoosen> Oh yeah, its from the cliffs on the left that if you dash you go over the starting area
[3:53:24] <%Divryne> Congrats you finished Crystal Peak.
[3:53:25] <SatansDick1> greenpath
[3:53:27] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> only thing left to the right is the edge
[3:53:27] <cintra212> The only thing to the right is Kingdom's Edge.
[3:53:30] <%Sirculbs> Lake of whatever time now?
[3:53:41] <$HeroToxiko> crazytalk requiem
[3:53:42] <$magikestral> greenpath then kingdoms edge, I'd say
[3:53:48] <Rostichenburg> We must find Unn's Law
[3:53:57] <grayjammer> Crystal Peak『 C L E A R 』
[3:54:03] <Tisaric> Unn's charm is the best
[3:54:12] <Rostichenburg> Pat you must face the law of Unn
[3:54:12] <$Tredecian> @magikestral no i remember dashing left over town they must have changed it
[3:54:26] <+Tylermcd93> Oh man the crystal peak music is so good
[3:54:27] <grayjammer> oo!
[3:54:30] <SatansDick1> go to greenpath
[3:54:35] <+drakthebest> Pat should really start the grim troupe DLC
[3:54:35] <%stigna1> Bapanada!
[3:54:37] <asbestosflavored> go to bed
[3:54:42] <%BioApple> should've dropped right on top of bretta, would've dropped her bugpants hard
[3:54:43] <+jjjkopf> bafanada
[3:54:43] <Burpinator1> He should check on the other merchant
[3:54:46] <$magikestral> greenpath has the lake and the dash area, both of which will help pat
[3:54:53] <Rostichenburg> Green Path
[3:54:54] <%stigna1> How the tables have turned!
[3:54:58] <Tisaric> greenpath has quite a bit to explore now
[3:55:01] <%mattmanj17> KIGDOMS EDGE
[3:55:05] <SatansDick1> stone sanctuary in greenpath
[3:55:05] <%rdark_ksu> big family!
[3:55:06] <AtlasMcCoy> there are MANY grubmos
[3:55:13] <$Mendin> The stuff in the Howling Cliffs probably is better to start sooner rather than later
[3:55:16] <BakerBrute> WA haHAha
[3:55:16] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat Go above the area
[3:55:20] <SatansDick1> woow
[3:55:28] <magmakhan3> theres that fountain you can drop money into btw now that you have 3k
[3:55:29] <%stigna1> @Rostichenburg If you mean the root, already done.
[3:55:30] <grayjammer> I'd say Greenpath via Howling Cliffs but its honestly easier to have only 1 goal at a time
[3:55:32] <SatansDick1> stone sanctuary
[3:55:37] <+JustToWatch> should probably clear out howling cliffs
[3:55:37] <%Spydurman> go to bed
[3:55:37] <%BioApple> he did the fountain
[3:55:38] <Rostichenburg> Ah didn't see it
[3:55:39] <%stigna1> @magmakhan3 Already done , friendo.
[3:55:40] <+gantz_zero> @magmakhan3 already did it
[3:55:42] <%TheTakkster> finish deepnest
[3:55:43] <magmakhan3> ah
[3:55:45] <+Camail> fungal wastes is a good zone to go to now
[3:55:45] <Eresus> @magmakhan3 he already did
[3:55:51] <Rostichenburg> Hard to tell when a wall is broken or not
[3:55:53] <+Dimfish> you already did
[3:56:00] <ValidVenasaur> howling cliffs maybe
[3:56:01] <zaiwolfgang> Greenpath
[3:56:01] <%stigna1> Of all the suggestions. >_>
[3:56:01] <Rostichenburg> Green Path Pat
[3:56:01] <+oOZtkOo> \o/
[3:56:02] <Zanicedg> Did it already.
[3:56:05] <SatansDick1> you already did it
[3:56:10] <$RaikenTB> 10 left?
[3:56:11] <Tisaric> man it's crazy seeing the map not filled out after finishing the game
[3:56:11] <+oOZtkOo> \O/
[3:56:11] <fillamar> He means the essence tree probably
[3:56:12] <$magikestral> greenpath's warp is closer to helpful shit than howling cliffs
[3:56:15] <Them00n> !uptime
[3:56:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 56m 17s.
[3:56:16] <cerberuscarmine> grubmos love it
[3:56:17] <Rostichenburg> Sorry missed the start of the stream my bad
[3:56:22] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Go do the Dreamer in Deepnest that you found
[3:56:25] <OmnipotentTrevor> I wonder why no one is suggesting to fill out the path to the left of Queen's Station.
[3:56:32] <%stigna1> @Rostichenburg No fears, no worries. :)
[3:56:32] <Envy_the_spider> 7 left @RaikenTB
[3:56:43] <$magikestral> @omnipotenttrevor always thought that was a bit too far for right now
[3:56:45] <Shemegory> Oo!
[3:56:53] <Zanicedg> @shadow1man9 not yet. He'll more lore if he waits.
[3:56:54] <Rostichenburg> There's one more time stop before fog canyon is easier
[3:56:55] <%BioApple> @OmnipotentTrevor that's fog canyon, right? Still timestopped
[3:57:01] <TheEdrem> at least kill that damn dreamer you almost already killed
[3:57:01] <fillamar> kingdom's edge
[3:57:04] <Endocrom> Bees?
[3:57:07] <AtlasMcCoy> can you get another charm notch?
[3:57:09] <Rostichenburg> You can technically do fog canyon now
[3:57:12] <%Everpresent_Overseer> BEEEES
[3:57:13] <Tisaric> I think crystal peak is 100% done or almost there
[3:57:16] <SatansDick1> youve got a couple places in greenpath, bees and deepnest
[3:57:20] <$coffeeabomination> @AngriestPat hey pat if you want to get to kingdoms edge i'm pretty sure the room before the dream moth if you smash the coffin in the bottom of that room with dark decent you can go to kingdom's edge
[3:57:20] <%mattmanj17> kingdoms edge
[3:57:21] <OmnipotentTrevor> BioApple: there's a neat NPC over there, at least.
[3:57:29] <Rostichenburg> Green Path has some cool stuff
[3:57:33] <+gantz_zero> bees
[3:57:38] <asbestosflavored> jelly fish area
[3:57:46] <%Spydurman> beees??
[3:57:49] <CptBritches> BEEEES
[3:57:51] <SatansDick1> fog canyon
[3:57:51] <%Sirculbs> There's apparently a charm at the lake of Unn.
[3:57:52] <%stigna1> I LOVE the beeees.
[3:57:53] <grayjammer> Bees?
[3:57:53] <cerberuscarmine> beeeeeeeees
[3:57:54] <Eresus> leave the dreamer in deepnest for last for extra lore
[3:57:54] <+HyperionXV> Beeeeeeees
[3:57:56] <Rostichenburg> Don't wake up that dreamer yet if you want cool lore later
[3:57:57] <KayThree> beeeeeeeeeeees
[3:57:57] <nepwar> not the BEESSS
[3:58:00] <+drakthebest> Do the grim troupe DLC
[3:58:03] <Tisaric> I love what they did with the bees in the DLC
[3:58:06] <%stigna1> Ahhh, the beez. In my eyes.
[3:58:09] <Tisaric> the bees are really great now
[3:58:09] <SatansDick1> stone sanctuary and howling cliffs
[3:58:12] <%Everpresent_Overseer> You got to BEEEElive he will go to BEEES
[3:58:12] <%TheTakkster> Lake of unn doesn't have much
[3:58:12] <$magikestral> lake of unn has something because of the acid, and the dash area you can clearly see
[3:58:12] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Kingdom's Edge should be your next stop
[3:58:19] <+Dimfish> kingdoms edge as well
[3:58:20] <BakerBrute> I say do boss remixes
[3:58:23] <%stigna1> But seriously, it would be a good time to get started on Grimm troupe so there's less running around ticking boxes.
[3:58:26] <%Agami23> did pat forget about finding the bee's??
[3:58:26] <%Falilth> it's like 3 am pat
[3:58:29] <Rostichenburg> Lake of Unn and the crystal dash area
[3:58:36] <$magikestral> bees are too ahead of pat rn

[3:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:00:00] <+Camail> did pat ever find cloth?
[4:00:00] <Rostichenburg> Hornet was trying to kill you though so maybe she stopped another one
[4:00:00] <$RaikenTB> Thanks hydro_bot
[4:00:09] <Rostichenburg> Go for a swim in the lake
[4:00:14] <Tisaric> YEYEYEYE

[4:01:01] <+oOZtkOo> pat.exe has stopped working
[4:01:02] <$coffeeabomination> Ughh just go to kingdom's edge but sure the worthless pin alright
[4:01:08] <OmnipotentTrevor> Rostichenburg: Woah what, Cloth has a quest? I only ever found that NPC once, and wondered what she was about
[4:01:13] <+Tylermcd93> The fuu...
[4:01:22] <%AlfredoCavatelli> it's metroid
[4:01:24] <%stigna1> Could this be...anor londo?
[4:01:27] <%Falilth> it's a body
[4:01:31] <Rostichenburg> It's not the cool pin it's the crystal dash area I want him to do
[4:01:32] <Zanicedg> WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN!?
[4:01:34] <OmnipotentTrevor> She never appeared for me in the failed tramway like she did for Pat
[4:01:39] <+Ultimatefool> It's all one big goopula
[4:01:40] <+Dimfish> i think the acid here is just like, bayou gunk. The Orange Crush however is very related
[4:01:53] <%AlfredoCavatelli> pat i think you need to go to bed
[4:01:55] <BlindGato> Is the acid a New Londo scenario?, trying to wash away the evil?
[4:01:57] <KayThree> is this... anor londo?
[4:01:58] <AtlasMcCoy> Hello?
[4:01:59] <+G_Thunders> You’re still missing like 4 or 5 zones

[4:02:02] <+Tylermcd93> I think it's just rock structure
[4:02:05] <marylittle5657> you are entirely wrong pat
[4:02:08] <Rostichenburg> @OmnipotentTrevor Yeah she shows up several places until after you save her in ancient basin
[4:02:10] <%Sirculbs> What? You gettin Made in Abyss vibes or somethin?
[4:02:12] <+oOZtkOo> i think thats a bit of a stretch, there are fungi that look like this
[4:02:12] <zaiwolfgang> No he’s right
[4:02:13] <Endocrom> You are not in a human body. That I know of.
[4:02:14] <%Divryne> Pat are you referencing Aquaria and Made in Abyss?
[4:02:17] <Tisaric> best charm in the game
[4:02:18] <$Slimshazbot> is this anus londo?
[4:02:20] <juxtest> And the poop mountain is the pancreas

[4:09:41] <%korth367> go back
[4:09:42] <Burpinator1> This is nothing. This is just part one of 'get gud at platforming'
[4:09:42] <TheEdrem> The trick is not to let the thorns know you're afraid
[4:09:44] <+darthriven501> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye

[4:09:46] <Mnightshyamallama> it is almost like you tried to go backwards again
[4:09:47] <$Mendin> Oh yeah he got the shortcut
[4:09:49] <$magikestral> you unlocked shortcut though
[4:09:50] <magmakhan3> there was an easy platform to get to to the left
[4:09:52] <grayjammer> Why do you make things harder for yourself
[4:09:52] <SirSmudgey> you got the shortcut
[4:09:55] <NephiStreams> feelsbadman
[4:09:58] <Rostichenburg> By the time he does Path of Pain he'll probably have the charms to make it easier
[4:10:03] <%Sirculbs> what was the charm combo that he can get heals from spikes with?
[4:10:05] <%Spydurman> kill some more guys so you have heals
[4:10:07] <Tisaric> you do have the shortcut now
[4:10:14] <EMP_Ike_Turner> thats such an unpleasant death noise
[4:10:18] <%stigna1> @Sirculbs Grubsong and either Deep Focus or Hiveblood.
[4:10:25] <uninformedpotato> that's where the nail master is..
[4:10:26] <Eresus> hahaha

[4:10:36] <Zanicedg> WHAT!??!?!
[4:10:45] <Tisaric> I used Crazy Talk I guess
[4:10:46] <Zanicedg> I have never seen that.
[4:10:47] <%stigna1> @Sirculbs You get Soul by taking damage on spikes, then flip that soul into more healing or just regenerate it naturally with hiveblood.
[4:10:49] <Rostichenburg> Good jorb Pat
[4:10:52] <+Dimfish> you all did know how to use that short cut?
[4:10:52] <+greenfall> even with the health charms PoP is pretty difficult

[4:10:58] <+JustToWatch> GO LEFT
[4:11:03] <+Dimfish> you cannot do it

[4:16:06] <+skylerpilot> @Flyrant its great to charge as an opening attack and you can usually fit in a regular swing after it as well on most all punishes. It also stops you in the air in case you need to use it for avoidance. The spin does some crazy damage though.

[4:33:53] <+gantz_zero> WHO YOU GONNA CALL
[4:33:53] <Tisaric> It's not worth the fucking time is why
[4:33:54] <+morow1ec> Talk shit get hit
[4:34:01] <+gantz_zero> BUG BUSTERS
[4:34:02] <%Agami23> these people paid to have their characters die in the game.
[4:34:03] <%Sirculbs> he specifically said they were under his protection
[4:34:05] <Zanicedg> GHOST BUSTERS
[4:34:08] <+joey_jrpg> did he do chains of harrow or the sacrifice yet?
[4:34:08] <%Kirijuo> IT IS WORTH IT THO
[4:34:12] <+Dimfish> it is worth it
[4:34:14] <pede2011> Cause people paid good money for that shit and some designs are rad as fuck
[4:34:14] <Tisaric> It's 1 each
[4:34:15] <Hydrapissed> Big worth
[4:34:15] <%korth367> yeah it is
[4:34:15] <Flyrant> super worth it
[4:34:17] <+JustToWatch> just kill gorb
[4:34:18] <+Dimfish> dont listen to the haters pat
[4:34:19] <$Mendin> Yeah no the 900 Essence Reward is big strong
[4:34:20] <Hydrapissed> 7 more here WE GO
[4:34:22] <seamitten> they were patreon backers, meaning they're REAL GHOSTS
[4:34:26] <%korth367> super worth
[4:34:29] <Zanicedg> Pat ain't afraid of no ghost!
[4:34:31] <Flyrant> 900 essence is the juice
[4:34:33] <nexoosen> It is actually worth it right now, he can do that or he can fight another warrior, either works
[4:34:36] <Zeemod155> You can get 500 more in half the time
[4:34:36] <Rostichenburg> Learn to parry
[4:34:39] <+Dimfish> they killed all those patreon backers and sealed their souls in the video game
[4:34:40] <%Kirijuo> It's the most worth its ever been
[4:34:48] <Hydrapissed> or did he fight the king warrior out front?
[4:34:50] <%Agami23> its almost as bad as the two people who paid like, 200$ to get their characters into homestuck for 1 page before getting insta-gibbed
[4:34:52] <%BioApple> even the shade gets massive iframes on that
[4:34:52] <Hydrapissed> oh*
[4:34:53] <nexoosen> never has it been more worth
[4:35:02] <Rostichenburg> Coulda just fought Gorb or the Elder
[4:35:14] <Tisaric> a different warrior would be more fun and probably even take less time
[4:35:14] <AtlasMcCoy> CANT DODGE FOREVER
[4:35:15] <Flyrant> should probably start from the top
[4:35:23] <Eresus> lol
[4:35:31] <nexoosen> oof ouch owie
[4:35:35] <CptBritches> Git gud
[4:35:35] <ValidVenasaur> pat why you so evil tho
[4:35:37] <EMP_Ike_Turner> you thought

[4:35:43] <%GunEden> kill them all
[4:35:44] <+gantz_zero> they're not even cannon
[4:35:46] <pede2011> Did he check the descriptions beforehand?
[4:35:48] <Hydrapissed> I mean pretty sure u can kill that guy
[4:35:53] <awsomesaucekirby> Did pat catxh woolie's tweet about the zubaz stone?
[4:35:55] <KaiserMario> Pat gets harddicked killing innocents
[4:35:59] <Flyrant> the dream nail doesn't even kill ghosts it frees them from being stuck forever
[4:35:59] <+rogoho> You’re an animal
[4:36:01] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @gantz_zero But are they canon?
[4:36:03] <Rostichenburg> Did he meet Guts bug at least?
[4:36:03] <Mnightshyamallama> why doesn't he attack the first one?
[4:36:03] <%stigna1> @awsomesaucekirby Yee
[4:36:06] <$Tredecian> your shade drowned
[4:36:07] <hellfirejefe> YEAH KILL THE GHOSTS
[4:36:11] <nepwar> the animal he has become
[4:36:14] <nexoosen> He did
[4:36:23] <+gantz_zero> @Hunk_Of_Dunk eh. they're backers. i question it at least
[4:36:25] <AtlasMcCoy> that's 100% not the reason
[4:36:26] <%BioApple> you only ever get this close if you start by killing some of them
[4:36:32] <%korth367> ?
[4:36:34] <Noponiz> why are souls attacking
[4:36:35] <Hydrapissed> yeah it is
[4:36:37] <%BioApple> otherwise you progress in 30s
[4:36:47] <$Tredecian> oh shit
[4:36:48] <%stigna1> This is DLC.
[4:36:51] <hellfirejefe> yeah time stop
[4:36:54] <Flyrant> big reward
[4:36:54] <pede2011> TELEPORTATION IS GO
[4:36:54] <Tisaric> yeah DLC timestop
[4:36:55] <Hydrapissed> its exactly right next to her its perfect for when ur missing like 2
[4:37:01] <%ArcanumMBD> DLC UPGRADE
[4:37:03] <CptBritches> Warp point
[4:37:05] <Crimpson> Fast Travel
[4:37:05] <Hydrapissed> TELEPORT
[4:37:06] <%korth367> fast travel
[4:37:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> T I M E S T O P
[4:37:07] <cerberuscarmine> GASP
[4:37:08] <0rond> this was actually DLC
[4:37:09] <$RaikenTB> PogChamp
[4:37:09] <$Tredecian> teleport
[4:37:10] <@StridentSong> Be careful with that. It costs essence to use
[4:37:10] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Fast travel
[4:37:11] <nexoosen> @Noponiz he walked into a graveyard and a ghost was like "ey dont fuck with the dudes here" pat the n fucked with the ghosts
[4:37:11] <Zanicedg> TELEPORTATION ACHIEVED!
[4:37:11] <%Divryne> HOTZONE.
[4:37:13] <$magikestral> @angriestpat this is the teleport that woolie mentioned getting late
[4:37:14] <+Dimfish> INSTANT TRANSMISSION
[4:37:14] <Flyrant> hit down
[4:37:16] <OmnipotentTrevor> This upgrade is usually not worth using, I think
[4:37:18] <Crimpson> I always put my marker here
[4:37:22] <+Dimfish> hit down to place a gate
[4:37:26] <AtlasMcCoy> Farore's fuckin wind
[4:37:27] <Noponiz> @nexoosen that sounds like a poor choice
[4:37:27] <Rostichenburg> Teleportation was not worth this
[4:37:30] <Kghaleon> Be warned, it consumes 1 essence per warp
[4:37:30] <Flyrant> it costs one essence though
[4:37:30] <+Dimfish> and hit up to warp to it
[4:37:31] <Burpinator1> I can immediately see Pat forgetting which Warp Button is which already
[4:37:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie was right, the time saver
[4:37:32] <CptBritches> It costs one essence to use it
[4:37:33] <$Mendin> TELLYPOR'
[4:37:34] <%stigna1> @OmnipotentTrevor Its sooo good. You can go from anywhere to anywhere.
[4:37:34] <Tisaric> costing 1 isn't really that bad
[4:37:35] <+Dimfish> from anywhere in the world
[4:37:36] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat basically the teleporting of gungeon in a different way
[4:37:37] <Eresus> lol
[4:37:38] <hellfirejefe> the big time saver
[4:37:40] <Hydrapissed> Cost 1 BE careful
[4:37:42] <nexoosen> @Noponiz it was not
[4:37:44] <$Tredecian> cost 1 essence per teleport
[4:37:44] <nepwar> its a wesker port
[4:37:45] <ValidVenasaur> it uses essence
[4:37:46] <Tisaric> You get more essence from random mobs
[4:37:48] <+rogoho> you did it
[4:37:49] <+drakthebest> You get a lot more essence than you need in the game it is SUPER worth using
[4:37:50] <%korth367> put that shit in dirtmouth
[4:37:51] <$Mendin> ENJOY YOUR BOSS RUN OBVIATOR
[4:37:51] <Flyrant> yeah cost 1 essence
[4:37:52] <Tisaric> it's totally fine
[4:37:53] <%stigna1> Plus, you sometimes get essence from random enemy drops. It more than pays for itself.
[4:37:56] <Crimpson> You beat the game pat
[4:37:56] <%mattmanj17> you can move it
[4:37:58] <dandyspider> you have time travel
[4:38:01] <Hydrapissed> nah leave it here
[4:38:02] <Rostichenburg> It goes back to one specific area it's not great
[4:38:02] <Eresus> hahahaha
[4:38:02] <fillamar> BTW, you can't teleport the flower quest
[4:38:02] <%2017y> @Mendin i appreciated your electrical beast reference
[4:38:03] <Flyrant> why?
[4:38:07] <+Dimfish> SUCKS?!
[4:38:08] <CptBritches> How does it suck???
[4:38:09] <Crimpson> wait what?
[4:38:09] <pede2011> HOW DOES A TELEPORT SUCKS?
[4:38:10] <Tisaric> YOU DON'T NEED 900 TO DO IT
[4:38:10] <+Dimfish> HOW??????
[4:38:11] <EMP_Ike_Turner> PJSalt
[4:38:11] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> what
[4:38:11] <%ArcanumMBD> i think you get essence randomly from mobs now
[4:38:14] <Flyrant> who cares, it's one
[4:38:15] <$Mendin> @2017y *tips hat*
[4:38:16] <+Dimfish> IT ONLY USES ONE
[4:38:19] <SatansDick1> you have 900
[4:38:20] <custoadian> essence drops randomly from kills
[4:38:23] <$magikestral> @angriestpat i had 30k essence by the end of my playthrough
[4:38:26] <RDJohnson519> it only uses 1 essanse
[4:38:26] <Kghaleon> Later you get more essence than you'll ever need however,
[4:38:27] <cerberuscarmine> UNUSABLE
[4:38:27] <Hydrapissed> u can get them randomly and u get and excess so should be okay
[4:38:29] <CptBritches> It uses ONE for a warp point you can set ANYWHERE
[4:38:29] <hellfirejefe> you get essence for enemies jesus fella
[4:38:29] <+morow1ec> yeah fast travel in a game with lots of backtacking sux your right Kappa
[4:38:29] <$Tredecian> theres plenty of essence
[4:38:30] <%BioApple> The game is structured so killing the backers isn't necessary, plus the DLC adds a few hundred more, so you're gonna mad surplus if you try to get 100%
[4:38:31] <Rostichenburg> Pat's night it sucks
[4:38:32] <OmnipotentTrevor> stigna1: to the specific place you already placed the point, you mean
[4:38:32] <Flyrant> you can get over 2500 essence
[4:38:33] <cerberuscarmine> STOP THE STREAM ITS OVAH
[4:38:35] <cerberuscarmine> lol
[4:38:35] <pede2011> Dude, it's 1 per use and essence is a random drop @AngriestPat
[4:38:35] <+drakthebest> You get like, 900 more than you need pat
[4:38:35] <custoadian> and there is way, way more than enough fixed essence to get everything
[4:38:36] <Zanicedg> Why?
[4:38:37] <juxtest> You get essence hundreds at a time
[4:38:38] <%stigna1> Because it feels bad that it drains any at all. Its a feel bad thing. He really didn't need to know that, folks. >_>
[4:38:39] <Crimpson> Doing this is not worth it
[4:38:39] <fazoburquina> @AngriestPat you can get WAAAAAY more essence than you need to get all the rewards
[4:38:40] <nexoosen> My heart
[4:38:43] <+JavaManJoJo> by default you have a .5 chance for it to drop from enemies
[4:38:44] <Flyrant> you don't
[4:38:45] <@StridentSong> You don't
[4:38:48] <Flyrant> put another one down
[4:38:48] <+rogoho> 1 essence, what are you saving it for?
[4:38:48] <+drakthebest> You also pccasionally get some from killing enemies
[4:38:49] <%mattmanj17> only move it
[4:38:50] <Zanicedg> By placing a new one.
[4:38:50] <pede2011> Just set a new one
[4:38:51] <OmnipotentTrevor> You place a new one
[4:38:51] <%korth367> you just put it somewhere it
[4:38:51] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you can get like 2k from bosses
[4:38:52] <+Dimfish> you can place them anywhere for free
[4:38:53] <@StridentSong> It's permanent wherever you put it
[4:38:53] <+JavaManJoJo> according to the wiki
[4:38:54] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat you don't need 900 to keep doing it, and you get essence from random mobs now
[4:38:54] <$Tredecian> place new one
[4:38:55] <Crimpson> You don't, but you can create a new one
[4:38:55] <CptBritches> You don't, if you set a new one then it will move
[4:38:56] <Flyrant> place a new one
[4:38:56] <Hydrapissed> just set a new one
[4:38:57] <$shadow1man9> You set a new one
[4:38:58] <%yet_another_brony> place another
[4:38:58] <+Cofffee> 4Head just move it
[4:38:58] <%ArcanumMBD> it stays until you make a new one
[4:38:59] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its basically free
[4:39:00] <@StridentSong> You can just relocate it
[4:39:00] <+rogoho> make another
[4:39:01] <NerevaRising> just put another one
[4:39:02] <+Dimfish> you place another
[4:39:06] <%stigna1> @OmnipotentTrevor Yeah, but you can place it wherever. Make easy boss runs, drop it at a bench and explore to your hearts content and be free to warp back, its great.
[4:39:06] <+Dimfish> they're free to place
[4:39:13] <%kenpachi9211> apatDab DEATH COUNT 69 apatDab
[4:39:18] <AtlasMcCoy> @AngriestPat Well Now that you have it, there's a very small chance regular enemies will drop essence when you kill them
[4:39:20] <Flyrant> it's the best upgrade in the game, use it pat
[4:39:20] <EMP_Ike_Turner> nice
[4:39:23] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> You spend essence, and you can regain any spent essence back from defeated eemies, though only up to the highest you've had it normally I believe
[4:39:23] <hellfirejefe> nice
[4:39:23] <%Mev852_> nice
[4:39:28] <%BioApple> PAT YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS ANY MORE

[4:40:10] <%BioApple> LITERALLY RKO That Ghost For a Save State
[4:40:11] <Flyrant> @AngriestPat Enemies now randomly drop spent essence
[4:40:11] <Rostichenburg> Nah Pat has red bull he needs no sleep. Did you see how big those cans he was drinking were?
[4:40:21] <Hydrapissed> GET THEM ALL feed ur blade!
[4:40:27] <CptBritches> Enemies you kill can randomly give you essence, btw
[4:40:29] <seamitten> you can get essence from regular enemies randomly so it's cool to use teleport
[4:40:34] <startstoprepeat> suffer not the ghost to live.
[4:40:34] <Endocrom> Place a teleport so you don't have to run so far
[4:40:37] <BakerBrute> why doesnt pat just do dream bosses?
[4:40:38] <+gantz_zero> @Rostichenburg yeah they're only the size of his tiny baby hand
[4:40:38] <uninformedpotato> don't kill the ghosts
[4:40:47] <+Dimfish> yeah essence is def grindable if necessary
[4:40:51] <nexoosen> because pat wants to kill THESE ghosts
[4:40:53] <+Dimfish> (which it isnt necessary)
[4:40:54] <Flyrant> have to find dream bosses @BakerBrute
[4:40:55] <hellfirejefe> cleanse your nail in their ghost blood!
[4:40:56] <BakerBrute> Theres more bosses then just lost kin
[4:41:00] <uninformedpotato> get essence from dream bosses instead
[4:41:02] <%ArcanumMBD> @angriestpat all mobs now have a 2% chance to give essence. 4% if using the dreamwielder charm
[4:41:04] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat they made random enemies drop essence now that you have the teleport
[4:41:08] <Hydrapissed> I think killing the one attacking gives u some as well pat
[4:41:08] <cerberuscarmine> got em all pat
[4:41:11] <cerberuscarmine> good job
[4:41:12] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Talk to ghost defender.
[4:41:16] <Hydrapissed> heads up
[4:41:17] <nexoosen> He knows he can, but he wants to kill THESE ghosts
[4:41:18] <Zanicedg> Talk.
[4:41:30] <$Tredecian> hollowed out
[4:41:30] <%BioApple> GOOD JOB, HERO
[4:41:33] <Flyrant> sick fuck
[4:41:34] <nexoosen> GOT EM
[4:41:34] <Eresus> lol
[4:41:35] <0rond> why do these ghosts attack him? is that a DLC thing? I beat the game 100% before dlcs came out and don't remeber it
[4:41:36] <Rostichenburg> Pat loves killing NPCs
[4:41:36] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Once you have the Dreamgate, random foes drop essence. Especially after you hit them with spells or the dream nail. It more than pays for itself.
[4:41:37] <CptBritches> That was VERY worth it
[4:41:37] <seamitten> SAD GAME
[4:41:37] <AtlasMcCoy> Monster
[4:41:38] <Hydrapissed> GOT EM
[4:41:38] <@StridentSong> Damn

[4:42:02] <CptBritches> No, only using
[4:42:02] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Using it costs 1.
[4:42:03] <$shadow1man9> Using it
[4:42:04] <seamitten> using it
[4:42:05] <%yet_another_brony> using
[4:42:06] <+Dimfish> using it
[4:42:07] <%ArcanumMBD> @angriestpat all mobs now have a 2% chance to give essence. 4% if using the dreamwielder charm..
[4:42:07] <Hydrapissed> Placing is free using it cost
[4:42:13] <Rostichenburg> Put them back on the wheel of reincarnation for the Elder God
[4:42:13] <+Dimfish> placing is always free
[4:42:14] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat you don't need 900 to do it, using it costs, and enemies now have a chance to drop essence now
[4:42:15] <fazoburquina> using, placing is free
[4:42:18] <NerevaRising> you can get infinite essence pat
[4:42:19] <+Dimfish> but you cannot place in boss rooms
[4:42:21] <nexoosen> was this base game? i dont remember it at all
[4:42:29] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @ArcanumMBD Don't enemies only drop essence up to the highest you had it without spending it?
[4:42:30] <Rostichenburg> The Dream Gate is DLC
[4:42:32] <nexoosen> which is shocking because its amazing
[4:42:34] <seamitten> 900 bought it, you can use it whenever

[4:43:13] <AtlasMcCoy> PAT SLEEP
[4:43:16] <+Dimfish> PERHAPS JUST A LITTLE
[4:43:16] <%stigna1> We're gonna build a whole kingdom but you'll only need...THE EDGE.
[4:43:17] <AtlasMcCoy> FUCK
[4:43:18] <+gantz_zero> @seamitten it still costs 1 essence to teleport to the point every time, wherever it is
[4:43:19] <%whistlehunter> 24 hour stream here we come
[4:43:19] <Flyrant> do the arena coward!
[4:43:19] <scrumdrew> bed is bad for you

[4:43:26] <grayjammer> The end is never the end is never the end is never the
[4:43:28] <+drakthebest> COLOSSEUM OF FOOLS
[4:43:29] <$eldrich_horror> no sleep ever
[4:43:30] <MasterDecoder> Pat, sleep
[4:43:31] <%BioApple> WHO SAID THAT
[4:43:31] <nepwar> !uptime
[4:43:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 43m 33s.
[4:43:33] <%mister___doctor> Hey Pat can we go for 9 hours this time
[4:43:37] <+Dimfish> DAMMIT
[4:43:38] <$Mendin> AND THE SWERVE
[4:43:39] <+Dimfish> WHY
[4:43:40] <Tisaric> DAMMIT
[4:43:43] <hellfirejefe> BAITED
[4:43:43] <+Dimfish> WHO
[4:43:44] <+vixenpunch> haha
[4:43:48] <%Everpresent_Overseer> there is a traitor afungus
[4:43:48] <grayjammer> And they're right!!!!
[4:43:49] <%korth367> YEAH MUSHROOMS
[4:43:54] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @ArcanumMBD I've never seen essence drop if I was at "maximum", prior to using the dream gate. I'd wager that you can't gain essence from it, just *re*gain it
[4:43:55] <nexoosen> oh god
[4:43:57] <Tisaric> They are right but I'm still mad
[4:44:04] <Futurecity10> This stream really helps when I'm grinding out exp on runescape
[4:44:06] <%whistlehunter> Man I can't wait to pass out during this stream
[4:44:09] <%forevern2dust> I bet Pat is gonna die or a heart attack within a year of this date.
[4:44:10] <cerberuscarmine> honk his buuuuutt
[4:44:12] <Rostichenburg> I never used the dream gate and got a bunch of essence from enemies
[4:44:16] <Zanicedg> Is he gonna steam for two more hours?
[4:44:19] <seamitten> @gantz_zero totally, it just doesnt matter if he dips below 900
[4:44:20] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Any essence used with the dreamgate can drop from enemies. Thus, it pays for itself.
[4:44:28] <+JustToWatch> For the love of god start the dlc, you'll be annoyed when it asks you to go back to all the areas you're clearing out, just to do one small thing
[4:44:29] <nexoosen> he's gonna stream for an indeterminate amount of time
[4:44:42] <awsomesaucekirby> I like how this game gives eveyone a different playtheough
[4:44:44] <hellfirejefe> sleep is for weak
[4:44:49] <hellfirejefe> pump more recbull
[4:44:49] <Rostichenburg> It takes like five seconds to gather the dlc things calm down
[4:44:50] <%theblackgoddess> no rest for the wicked
[4:45:02] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat You said on Twitter it was gonna be a short stream you shit!
[4:45:04] <+drakthebest> Did pat ever finish that area in the mantis village?
[4:45:04] <%forevern2dust> @hellfirejefe he's not young enough for that
[4:45:08] <nexoosen> money dont grow on trees
[4:45:12] <Rostichenburg> At least put on the spore shroom charm for mushroom lore
[4:45:15] <SatansDick1> !uptime
[4:45:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 45m 17s.
[4:45:17] <%ArcanumMBD> @hunk_of_dunk it just says mins have a 0.5% chance normally, or a 2% chance if essence was spent (1% and 4% with dream wielder)
[4:45:19] <%BioApple> it is short... compared to what the next one will be >:3
[4:45:21] <Billruh> Ay i finaly got to tune in to a stream Hell yeah!
[4:45:32] <grayjammer> Chat super salty
[4:45:36] <Flyrant> how is this game only 15 dollars?
[4:45:53] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Even the children
[4:45:54] <%ArcanumMBD> @hunk_of_dunk so it might revert to the low chance when your back to where you were
[4:45:54] <awsomesaucekirby> Like, when i got to the bridge where you're supposed to use the mantis hook, i already had the crystal charge.
[4:45:55] <%forevern2dust> @Billruh It's probably not gonna go much longer
[4:45:56] <Tisaric> I have no idea how they didn't put it at least at 20
[4:45:59] <Rostichenburg> At least there's almost nothing here so we won't be here long
[4:46:05] <Billruh> Its fine
[4:46:07] <nexoosen> am i right in thinking the art for this game was like, 1 person or a really small number of people?
[4:46:08] <marylittle5657> go up
[4:46:10] <Tisaric> There's no reason this should cost only 15
[4:46:12] <$Tredecian> leg eater
[4:46:14] <+Dimfish> fuck weirdo
[4:46:15] <Flyrant> that's sir fuck weirdo

[4:46:23] <grayjammer> Leg Eater Is My Husband
[4:46:24] <hellfirejefe> yeah fuck weirdo
[4:46:27] <ryu1299> 3 people made the game
[4:46:27] <fazoburquina> this game is a goddamn steal at 15 dollars
[4:46:33] <marylittle5657> go left for more essence
[4:46:35] <Tisaric> @nexoosen the team is just 2 guys, they contracted out a few things but it's mostly them
[4:46:40] <$Mendin> Capitalism!
[4:46:42] <nexoosen> Hot damn
[4:46:43] <+Dimfish> he just wants the world to like him
[4:46:45] <Flyrant> has pat met the Troupe yet?
[4:46:45] <+Dimfish> hes adorable
[4:46:46] <%Sirculbs> left is a new area cause of acid blockage
[4:46:48] <+Dimfish> so cuddly
[4:46:53] <CeaselessSlick> Chat cares more for Pat's wellbeing than Pat himself
[4:46:56] <@StridentSong> Pat is doing the Troupe later
[4:46:57] <Endocrom> Did Pat steal that crack head's money?
[4:47:00] <marylittle5657> hey!
[4:47:00] <Kghaleon> He says something different with the charm that makes you smell
[4:47:03] <+Dimfish> they arebt kying
[4:47:03] <$Tredecian> i feel like fuck weirdo is a better name than leg eater
[4:47:04] <SatansDick1> dowm
[4:47:07] <Burpinator1> Completely misses it
[4:47:14] <Flyrant> he says you smell sweet or something with the stinky charm
[4:47:18] <SatansDick1> missed the tree dumbass
[4:47:25] <+Dimfish> he ran right by it
[4:47:26] <+Dimfish> lol
[4:47:29] <marylittle5657> you literally just waltzed strait past it
[4:47:30] <nexoosen> "nope"
[4:47:33] <Endocrom> Use your minions
[4:47:35] <%Kirijuo> I still can't believe Zubaz is canonically dead in Hollow Knight Lore
[4:47:37] <%Divryne> LUL
[4:47:39] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat you can get the map for fog canyon from that side
[4:47:42] <CptBritches> W o w

[4:47:53] <$RaikenTB> Why did you doubt us, Pat? Kappa
[4:47:56] <Zanicedg> You're on the other side of the wall in the fog canyon!
[4:48:00] <%kenpachi9211> MY BAD
[4:48:03] <Flyrant> oh no, pat's trying to platform
[4:48:04] <Rostichenburg> Zubaz isn't dead he's thoughts from another world

[4:48:10] <Tisaric> YES YOU DO
[4:48:12] <%kenpachi9211> BUT IT IS COMING
[4:48:20] <$Tredecian> yeah good stuff
[4:48:20] <@StridentSong> I didn't tell him why, just the number
[4:48:26] <marylittle5657> and you could probably get the waste's map from this side
[4:48:31] <%Dingus_Tickler> YO GUACAMELEE 2 IS FUCKING LEGIT
[4:48:32] <ryu1299> I thought you needed 2400?
[4:48:36] <awsomesaucekirby> And i hadn't upgraded my nail until waaaaay after city of tears.
[4:48:38] <%Agami23> its only bad if your bad
[4:48:40] <%Dingus_Tickler> I just spent 3 hours on it
[4:48:42] <@StridentSong> You need 1800 for the Time Stop
[4:48:44] <$Mendin> 2400 for plot, 1800 for timestop
[4:48:44] <Zanicedg> Get the map!
[4:48:44] <AtlasMcCoy> Dreamboys give the big juice tho
[4:48:45] <@StridentSong> 2400 is lore
[4:48:46] <grayjammer> 2400 is for fun lore and completionism
[4:48:47] <Rostichenburg> 2400 is just good lore stuff
[4:48:48] <Tisaric> 2400 is the last extra upgrade, 1800 is the big one
[4:48:51] <SatansDick1> you could probably get the map from this side
[4:48:51] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat This is the back way into Fog Canyon, you can go grab the map
[4:48:56] <%BioApple> oh shit is that out? i still haven't touched LM2 or MHW, now my backlog is mega fucked
[4:49:10] <ryu1299> cool cool it's been a bit since I beat it
[4:49:10] <nexoosen> rip healjuice
[4:49:10] <Endocrom> That bench is just a carcas
[4:49:13] <Flyrant> I just beat the game and am going through looking for every secret and am stuck at 1760 essence FeelsBadMan
[4:49:23] <Rostichenburg> Yeah methinks he's going to end up doing Monomon before anything
[4:49:31] <Tisaric> I was stuck right below 1800 for the longest time too
[4:49:32] <$RaikenTB> waow
[4:49:34] <nepwar> time for mouse and keyboard
[4:49:34] <+FadingEmber> do I hear Johns?
[4:49:36] <%Agami23> maybe its acting up because you've been playing too long?
[4:49:39] <ryu1299> see I have that too but I think it's just the switch version
[4:49:42] <Tisaric> I struggled with a boss for so long
[4:49:45] <Futurecity10> @Flyrant Try cheat engine if you dont want to farm
[4:49:45] <Rostichenburg> @Flyrant Did you do the repeat bosses?
[4:49:46] <+gantz_zero> @Rostichenburg is that a digimon Kappa
[4:49:50] <Nishi74> Try turning V-sync off. It fixes some controller issues
[4:50:03] <%ArcanumMBD> @flyrant do all the dream bosses and ghosts those are the big ones
[4:50:15] <AtlasMcCoy> Oh i like this guy
[4:50:21] <Flyrant> yeah I can't find them is the problem
[4:50:22] <Kghaleon> Fuck this guy

[4:50:29] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I mean, the mantis are fine
[4:50:29] <Tisaric> ???
[4:50:31] <Kghaleon> One of the harder fights
[4:50:34] <Tisaric> oh ok
[4:50:37] <%BioApple> They come to this place when they know they are not pure?
[4:50:38] <Rostichenburg> Monomon wrote the elegy for Hallownest
[4:50:38] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> THe mantis are all good

[4:51:04] <nexoosen> I dont remember this dude at akk either
[4:51:09] <rosemon5001> KII KO HOOO
[4:51:11] <Rostichenburg> Cool saved the 1 minute it would take to walk here
[4:51:11] <%stigna1> @StridentSong Would you consider letting him know that dreamgate-consumed essence drops from slain mobs? I think it'd help him feel better about using it, and cut down on the backtracking he'll end up doing to fill out areas.
[4:51:16] <+discodemolition> @Kghaleon my inpatience killed me here a couple of times before i learned to take it slow
[4:51:18] <grayjammer> Try Not Walking Into The enemy
[4:51:21] <nepwar> this is a cool boss
[4:51:21] <$Mendin> Oh right Pat forgot how doddging works

[4:51:40] <%BioApple> this seems like a real good fight for quick focus
[4:51:43] <Bendy_V> That was so good though
[4:51:45] <+FadingEmber> good attempt
[4:51:48] <+Tylermcd93> That was pretty good
[4:51:50] <@StridentSong> I'll let him know in a bit
[4:51:54] <$Tredecian> great slash does 2.5 naildamage might not always be worth it
[4:52:01] <Tisaric> I think he's fine with using it now
[4:52:02] <Kghaleon> Sometimes you just don't move fast enough if they catch you in a bad spot.
[4:52:03] <Rostichenburg> Quick Focus or Joni's Blessing
[4:52:09] <%VoxNoctemz> @AngriestPat Pat you gonna play till 6AM again?
[4:52:11] <+JustToWatch> he has a plus 2 sword, he's super overleveled for this fight

[4:52:30] <nepwar> what happens if you dreamnail your shadow self
[4:52:49] <%stigna1> @nepwar It instantly reabsorbs it.
[4:52:53] <+gantz_zero> oh cool
[4:52:54] <+ozzyzak> please papa
[4:53:01] <%BioApple> because it dreams of being inside you
[4:53:06] <shootybooty1> i blame matt's poor ammo management for this
[4:53:09] <%stigna1> Yee! But under special circumstances.....
[4:53:10] <Zeemod155> DASH
[4:53:13] <KatabolicRage> wait what, I came here expecting to see a vod
[4:53:15] <CeaselessSlick> Elmo want attention
[4:53:21] <KatabolicRage> how long have you been at this this time pat
[4:53:23] <nexoosen> you got this
[4:53:25] <+Dimfish> how
[4:53:25] <%ArcanumMBD> same thing every time. maybe it will work next time
[4:53:25] <%kenpachi9211> apatDab DEATH COUNT 72 apatDab
[4:53:27] <@StridentSong> !uptime
[4:53:28] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat maybe try out that Unn charm?
[4:53:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 53m 29s.
[4:53:28] <nepwar> @stigna1 oh thats cool
[4:53:28] <SirSmudgey> pet elmo
[4:53:29] <%theblackgoddess> hes literally not moving
[4:53:29] <%stigna1> @KatabolicRage Haha, joke's on you! The Hollow Knight never ends!
[4:53:33] <grayjammer> Nail arts i think make dashes a bit fucky sometimes
[4:53:33] <%Agami23> have you considered dodging?
[4:53:36] <+morow1ec> Doest it count as a boss fight if you just face tank every bit of damage ?
[4:53:41] <woolstep12> if you stand in a corner he can't hit you
[4:53:42] <$Tredecian> thsi is the worst bench
[4:53:46] <%forevern2dust> Maybe pick a side instead of getting hit by the two in the middle?
[4:53:48] <EMP_Ike_Turner> big mad
[4:53:52] <+gantz_zero> @theblackgoddess he's trying to find the timing to dash. not just "not moving"
[4:54:13] <%ArcanumMBD> @forevern2dust no way, it didn't work the last 6 times it has to work next time
[4:54:17] <%stigna1> "We remember The Elder" "Elder Who?"
[4:54:18] <nexoosen> Aye, he's dashing a little too early and hitting the 2 either side of the middle
[4:54:19] <Rostichenburg> We respect the Elder around here
[4:54:24] <Crimpson> It looks like you are getting hit by him because you rely too much on the charged blade.
[4:54:25] <Tisaric> panootsThink panootsThink
[4:54:28] <%forevern2dust> @ArcanumMBD oh yeah, my bad
[4:54:29] <Crimpson> Don't use it as much
[4:54:32] <Flyrant> big hard
[4:54:32] <Crimpson> and just hit up
[4:54:43] <Kghaleon> Worst dream fight
[4:54:46] <AlasterAngelo> just dig up idiot
[4:54:50] <AtlasMcCoy> Pat's archenemy, being able to run into the enemy
[4:54:51] <Flyrant> I really liked this fight
[4:54:55] <seamitten> i definitely did not get the tentacle attack in my playthrough
[4:55:00] <Flyrant> one of the more interesting bosses imo
[4:55:04] <%ArcanumMBD> HE DODGED IT
[4:55:04] <+Tylermcd93> This is the hollow knight equivalent of Bed of Chaos
[4:55:06] <Tisaric> yeah this is one of the cooler warrior boss
[4:55:12] <@StridentSong> Quick Nail | Mark of Pride makes this fight a lot easier
[4:55:13] <+gantz_zero> charge blade is only 2x damage apparently @AngriestPat
[4:55:17] <Rostichenburg> I couldn't find this fight for ages because the stupid pin didn't activate for some reason
[4:55:18] <%kenpachi9211> apatDab DEATH COUNT 73 apatDab
[4:55:22] <$shadow1man9> This fight is probably the easiest one next to Gorb
[4:55:23] <$Mendin> The tentacle attack is one of the earliest charms you can find.
[4:55:24] <%BioApple> Does he have quick nail?
[4:55:25] <woolstep12> stand in the leftcorner
[4:55:27] <Crimpson> Try not using your charged blade attack so much
[4:55:32] <%forevern2dust> He was doing really good earlier on the first attempt after he got to his last pip.
[4:55:34] <Rostichenburg> Xero is way easier
[4:55:37] <%ArcanumMBD> @tylermcd93 lmao what no way. it's just timing, or getting time stop
[4:55:38] <+Dimfish> im falling asleep oh no
[4:55:38] <%BioApple> oh yeah
[4:55:39] <Tisaric> Unn would help a lot
[4:55:40] <Heyestus> maybe airdash to avoid that attack. being higher will give you more time between impacts.
[4:55:43] <Kghaleon> I imagine if you dodge through those early enough, you'll have time to heal
[4:55:43] <Zanicedg> @gantz_zero 2.5x
[4:55:43] <+Dimfish> i am weak
[4:55:50] <woolstep12> he can't hit you if you stand in the left corner
[4:55:52] <Flyrant> pat just go bugs, lots of bugs
[4:55:54] <seamitten> oh is that thorns?
[4:55:56] <nexoosen> I found it easier to watch the ground and dash to the where i see the splat during the stagger attack
[4:55:57] <%Agami23> shape of unn would make it so you can dodge while healing
[4:55:58] <$Mendin> Yeah
[4:55:59] <grayjammer> The Deepnest Dream Warrior's the worst one
[4:56:04] <nexoosen> the one that closes ionto the middle
[4:56:09] <+gantz_zero> thorns is pretty bad here @AngriestPat
[4:56:13] <ryu1299> spore shook and defenders cresr
[4:56:13] <@StridentSong> Shape of Unn makes you super slow
[4:56:24] <%BioApple> unless you have dashmaster
[4:56:35] <Tisaric> I still find shape of unn like mandatory
[4:56:35] <woolstep12> stand in the left cor er
[4:56:37] <$Tredecian> @StridentSong I think it synergizes with sprint or dashmaster
[4:56:49] <%ArcanumMBD> or speed focus
[4:56:52] <@StridentSong> Ther we go
[4:57:04] <seamitten> you're doing it peter
[4:57:07] <Rostichenburg> I prefer quick focus to shape of unn and even then I like to just over power everything
[4:57:10] <%stigna1> Nah, it works with spore shroom, baldur shell and quick focus.
[4:57:11] <CptBritches> He's learning!
[4:57:23] <%stigna1> Quick focus being the movement-booster.
[4:57:24] <TheEdrem> oh, does he not have the timestop that makes this trivial?
[4:57:38] <%stigna1> @TheEdrem If you mean edgy timestop, no.
[4:57:39] <Flyrant> I feel like the minion charms would make this fight trivial
[4:57:40] <+gantz_zero> he's got it this time for sure
[4:57:42] <Rostichenburg> No he refuses to make progress again
[4:57:42] <@StridentSong> He does not
[4:57:43] <Tisaric> oh yeah movement-boosted unn is great
[4:57:46] <Flyrant> minions and quick focus
[4:57:47] <%BioApple> ah sorry, spent the whole game using long/pride/quick so I didn't experiment much
[4:57:57] <AtlasMcCoy> Waiting works if you can dash on time
[4:57:58] <%forevern2dust> LUL
[4:57:59] <hellfirejefe> good shit pat
[4:58:00] <nexoosen> GOTTEM
[4:58:00] <Flyrant> nice

[4:58:05] <nexoosen> Good job!
[4:58:06] <BakerBrute> GG
[4:58:08] <%ArcanumMBD> he do it
[4:58:16] <CptBritches> You're our hero, Pat
[4:58:22] <Rostichenburg> Your soul is mine
[4:58:30] <Flyrant> noice
[4:58:34] <$Mendin> He got chumped by the Mantises
[4:58:36] <BakerBrute> he got hius ass beat by mantises
[4:58:37] <nexoosen> You will no longer be needing this
[4:58:44] <$Tredecian> missionary tried to convert the mantises
[4:58:47] <AlasterAngelo> was he a lightning bug?
[4:58:50] <AtlasMcCoy> Sleep time
[4:58:50] <cerberuscarmine> get deded by the mantus
[4:58:50] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> At least they made him a grave
[4:58:54] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> He deserved that much
[4:58:55] <Rostichenburg> They buried him right though
[4:59:03] <grayjammer> LUL
[4:59:04] <%stigna1> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Yeah man, Manti are honourable A F.
[4:59:04] <cerberuscarmine> pfffff
[4:59:06] <+gantz_zero> lol sucker punched
[4:59:16] <+JustToWatch> take down gorb next, he's super easy comparitively
[4:59:41] <@StridentSong> Once I have the Mark of Pride, I always bow to the mantises as I go by
[4:59:44] <Flyrant> you should place your teleport at a station
[4:59:47] <Rostichenburg> Mantis village is the closest bench
[4:59:50] <$Mendin> Pat weren't you going to sleep after finishing greenpath
[4:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:59] <+drakthebest> Take down gorb and while you’re at it start the grim troupe DLC
[5:00:05] <woolstep12> have you done all of the kingdoms edge?
[5:00:08] <%stigna1> Also, wow, thanks so much to Stridentsong for telling Pat about story Time Stop stuff, and thereby keeping it elegant and spoiler-free, but more realistically attainable.
[5:00:11] <$RaikenTB> Thanks hydrobot.
[5:00:12] <demifiend6> theres no time for sleep. completion stream is now boys.
[5:00:12] <@StridentSong> He's doing the Troupe stuff later
[5:00:13] <Tisaric> yeah I try to bow when an npc bows at me, grimm troupe is great for that
[5:00:14] <fillamar> He hasn't done any
[5:00:15] <Zanicedg> Wrong way.
[5:00:15] <%BioApple> @woolstep12 more like, uh, none
[5:00:23] <Eresus> lol
[5:00:25] <grayjammer> Too high up
[5:00:27] <cerberuscarmine> riiiip
[5:00:30] <Flyrant> big lost
[5:00:32] <woolstep12> oh then he should do it
[5:00:33] <Rostichenburg> Hasn't even found the map in kingdom's edge
[5:00:43] <AtlasMcCoy> This is how the game was MEANT to be played
[5:00:49] <nexoosen> hasnt even been to kingdoms edge right?
[5:00:51] <$Mendin> I don't think he's even officially BEEN to Kingdom's Edge yet
[5:01:03] <%BioApple> He's been there for a bit, seen the hive too, but not very far
[5:01:04] <Rostichenburg> At least he can talk to big caterpillar boy
[5:01:05] <nexoosen> he took like 2 steps in and noped back out
[5:01:06] <Tisaric> He's dipped his toes in Kingdom's edge
[5:01:13] <Zanicedg> This is embarrassing.
[5:01:15] <%forevern2dust> Why not stop moving around so much and getting your bearings?
[5:01:20] <$Mendin> He found the wrong end of a one-way shortcut door
[5:01:30] <fillamar> I wish people didn't talk about the map stuff. Everyone who hasn't played it thinks there isn't a map or something weird
[5:01:31] <+FrostMass22> Something something Kingdom's Edge
[5:01:40] <pebblypirate> he found the shortcut from queens station and then immediatly left
[5:01:41] <Eresus> mushroom people

[5:02:21] <demifiend6> pat cant even handle metroid, why the hell isnt he wearing the wayward compass?!
[5:02:23] <+Dimfish> they praised too hard
[5:02:24] <Flyrant> that's normal
[5:02:26] <%stigna1> "Go on! Go oooon. Its a sin to resist nature. Its a sign to chain the light!"
[5:02:26] <fillamar> Remember it, pat
[5:02:30] <Rostichenburg> Just no sense of direction
[5:02:32] <AlasterAngelo> is that guy okay?
[5:02:35] <Zanicedg> Inspect them.
[5:02:35] <Eresus> light
[5:02:37] <Rostichenburg> Inspect those guys
[5:02:38] <RDJohnson519> thats gross...
[5:02:40] <$Tredecian> light bright ads are getting outta hand

[5:02:43] <%Agami23> getting pretty tales of zestria in here
[5:02:43] <KatabolicRage> how grossly incandescent
[5:02:45] <seamitten> he's just a little infected, he's still good, he's still good.
[5:02:46] <hellfirejefe> he'll be fine er i think
[5:02:51] <%yet_another_brony> light is bad
[5:02:53] <Flyrant> he's gonna make it!
[5:03:05] <+gantz_zero> light bud dark gud
[5:03:07] <nexoosen> he's cool
[5:03:07] <hellfirejefe> nah dudes totally dead
[5:03:09] <+seriousink> they're bugs, pat. of course they don't like light
[5:03:09] <damienlunas> Don't go towards the light
[5:03:12] <TheEdrem> fkn death note spoilers
[5:03:13] <RDJohnson519> hell be fiiiine
[5:03:15] <$Mendin> Light is fine, you're just being intolerant of other peoples' religions
[5:03:16] <%Divryne> Embrace the BLACK EVIL.
[5:03:16] <%Tylord92> They'll be fine.
[5:03:20] <rosemon5001> EVERLASTING DARKNESS 4LYF
[5:03:22] <Flyrant> it's the same
[5:03:24] <Rostichenburg> These guys love light because they're plant bugs
[5:03:33] <%BioApple> According to top bug scientists, depending on observation light can act as either a particle OR a supernatural force of evil! Science is fun!
[5:03:34] <Tisaric> Deepnest is too far away from the source to really matter
[5:03:35] <%yet_another_brony> tales of zesty?
[5:03:37] <+gantz_zero> FILL YOUR DARK SOUL WITH LOYYYYYYYYGHT
[5:03:38] <marylittle5657> has pat met midwife?
[5:03:42] <%stigna1> @marylittle5657
[5:03:43] <+Tylermcd93> Might be brighter with all that orange
[5:03:45] <%yet_another_brony> infected malevolence
[5:03:46] <%stigna1> Yes
[5:03:47] <pebblypirate> we dont go to deepnest anymore

[5:04:17] <@StridentSong> Alright, I'm heading to bed. Don't spoil stuff. Also final reminder: PAT IS DOING GRIMM TROUPE LATER, DO NOT SPOIL THE CONTENT
[5:04:19] <nexoosen> <3
[5:04:19] <Flyrant> will pat ever find a bench?
[5:04:23] <TheEdrem> wait did he do queens station with double jump?
[5:04:26] <pebblypirate> !uptime
[5:04:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 4m 28s.
[5:04:29] <AtlasMcCoy> it cool

[5:05:11] <Crimpson> Go do the arena
[5:05:13] <$Tredecian> "hey what color is your blood?"
[5:05:13] <CptBritches> Mantis boys are STRONG
[5:05:14] <Tisaric> I'm glad Pat has the same addiction to this game I did
[5:05:16] <%BioApple> Had to dissect them for science purposes
[5:05:16] <%yet_another_brony> murder
[5:05:16] <%forevern2dust> they are fine, just assholes
[5:05:17] <Rostichenburg> Gotta see elder mushroom man
[5:05:18] <rossnwolf> Murderer
[5:05:23] <Flyrant> pat become the greatest fool at the arena
[5:05:24] <nepwar> no bowing to the mantis i guess
[5:05:30] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Their honor was so strong that it told the biocurse to fuck off
[5:05:31] <%Dingus_Tickler> I like the different tone of today’s stream, in comparison to the LPs and the goblin garbage smearing arguments that you have with the Misses
[5:05:36] <CptBritches> Mantis > all other weak bugs
[5:05:43] <cerberuscarmine> pat is actually peach thats why all the wahmen are dyin
[5:05:48] <AtlasMcCoy> Im like, 80% as lost as pat is
[5:05:52] <SatansDick1> go to bench
[5:05:54] <%stigna1> lol
[5:05:55] <scrumdrew> you can place a dream gate to tell where you are
[5:06:00] <%stigna1> Oh, true!
[5:06:07] <CptBritches> Pat navigation go down
[5:06:13] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat You can place a dreamgate whenever; its free and shows up on the map.
[5:06:15] <$Mendin> Should see what the mantises have to say
[5:06:17] <Eresus> rip shroom charm
[5:06:25] <Zanicedg> @Dingus_Tickler "the goblin garbage smearing arguments" That's great.
[5:06:27] <pebblypirate> doesnt it cost essence?
[5:06:31] <nexoosen> rip
[5:06:34] <TheyCallMeVawn> Pat its 4AM, why are you still up
[5:06:36] <%Tylord92> Navigation go up.
[5:06:39] <DracaenaLeaf> instinct
[5:06:39] <Endocrom> Buggist
[5:06:39] <%yet_another_brony> why
[5:06:44] <Tisaric> It doesn't cost essence to place, only to warp to
[5:06:47] <%stigna1> @pebblypirate No, just warping to it. And any essence used to do so is returned to you as you slay creatures.
[5:06:51] <CptBritches> THERE HE IS

[5:08:35] <%Dingus_Tickler> @zanicedg One stays at home in a solitary state for most of the year, while the other goes off buying McDonalds and hooker boots throughout the year. Our Apartment Goblin buys a $2000 Fan Blower once, and our Mustard Hooker Boots Goblin freaks out
[5:08:38] <nexoosen> because hollow knight
[5:08:39] <fazoburquina> has pat done bee zone?
[5:08:42] <TheyCallMeVawn> Has Pat found all the Nailmasters?
[5:08:43] <Rostichenburg> Don't forget to dream nail suspicious things
[5:08:43] <TranquilTurnip> !uptime
[5:08:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 8m 45s.
[5:08:47] <AtlasMcCoy> No bees yet
[5:08:48] <%BioApple> Hollow Knight is like the fighting game barrel: it always gets deeper
[5:08:51] <+gantz_zero> like it's the center
[5:08:52] <Top_Lane_Duelist> pat its 4am
[5:09:01] <Flyrant> not all of them @TheyCallMeVawn
[5:09:08] <nexoosen> cant stop wont stop
[5:09:18] <Zanicedg> @Dingus_Tickler You're hilarious.
[5:09:19] <+Stonehewer> I felt bad killing all the cute mushrooms. Pat, on the other hand, feels no remorse
[5:09:28] <+gantz_zero> \m/
[5:09:31] <CptBritches> Don't listen to the weaklings, Pat. You can go another 6 hours easy
[5:09:33] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Pat's found the greenpath and the howling cliffs nailmasters, though I suspect he knows where the third one is
[5:09:42] <Eresus> the mushroom genocide
[5:09:44] <Rostichenburg> Is this what happened after the Spore Wars?
[5:09:48] <+gantz_zero> headbanging mushroom \m/
[5:09:49] <%stigna1> Shrumal Ogre "Huge fungal creature. Attacks by spitting corrosive venom and slamming its body into foes. Are these hulking things beasts or are they mushroom? I cut one in half and peered inside to find out, but could find no answers in its soft, stinking insides."
[5:09:55] <nexoosen> chat made it pretty clear where the third is but he may have forgotten
[5:10:11] <%BioApple> Shrumal Ogre: "What're ye doin in mah core?"
[5:10:19] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> He didn't say he would remember, so he still might
[5:10:27] <Wablafarga> I fell asleep watching the VoD and woke to him Live
[5:10:33] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> If he said he would keep it in mind though, then he's lost
[5:10:37] <pebblypirate> so what is Geo actually?
[5:10:41] <fazoburquina> deep... like a nest
[5:10:42] <Aixenn> hey guys how far in is Pat right now?
[5:10:51] <Rostichenburg> Geo is fossalised shells
[5:10:55] <$Tredecian> @pebblypirate geo is fossilized bug shells
[5:10:56] <grayjammer> @pebblypirate valuable rocks, i assume

[5:11:43] <Tisaric> He's probably about at the 50-60% mark
[5:11:50] <pebblypirate> well theres all the stuff at the bottom of the world and kingdoms edge so hes got a lot
[5:11:50] <Rostichenburg> Spore charm for more mushroom lore
[5:11:57] <Tisaric> There's so much more to find still
[5:11:58] <Zanicedg> Nail the manti!
[5:12:00] <AtlasMcCoy> He can check his completion % on the main menu if he wants to
[5:12:09] <Rostichenburg> There's still like 4 or 5 areas to go
[5:12:10] <%forevern2dust> I think this is literally the dankest game ever
[5:12:10] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @AtlasMcCoy Can you do that yet? I thought that was a later thing

[5:12:20] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat No work tomorrow?
[5:12:24] <nexoosen> world is a fuck
[5:12:26] <pebblypirate> that doesnt really give a good idea though
[5:12:26] <%stigna1> @Tisaric Not until the veeery end.
[5:12:27] <$RaikenTB> tomorrow? that's 20 hours away.
[5:12:28] <%Dingus_Tickler> 5 hours NotLikeThis
[5:12:33] <AtlasMcCoy> It doesnt?
[5:12:36] <Tisaric> yeah that's what I thought
[5:12:38] <AtlasMcCoy> I thought it was always on your save file
[5:12:43] <KoyaMusa> he streamed for 8 last time
[5:12:46] <+drakthebest> Hey Pat id you would like to cap it off with a boss you can fight the dream version of soul master
[5:12:47] <Tisaric> At the very end it unlocks it for you
[5:12:54] <Endocrom> Is it physically possible for Pat to stop playing without finishing an area?
[5:12:56] <Rostichenburg> I thought it only showed up after lore reasons
[5:13:08] <nexoosen> dream soul master WOULD make it 8~ hours
[5:13:12] <ryu1299> maybe you should stream this game earlier so if 6 to 8 hours happens again you can sleep normal
[5:13:17] <cerberuscarmine> 8 hour stream hype :D
[5:13:21] <%Dingus_Tickler> @endocrom Pat has OCD, so no.

[5:13:28] <Rostichenburg> Soul Tyrant is hard but not crazy
[5:13:31] <pebblypirate> its 1% per charm, some for the dreamers and then also some for the dream nail and other upgrades
[5:13:43] <pebblypirate> might be other stuff too its been awhile
[5:13:44] <%stigna1> @nexoosen Hah, yeah. I went directly to that as soon as I could, and did the dream version immediately. Took a little learning.
[5:13:55] <$Mendin> I love the Owen Wilshrooms
[5:14:00] <nexoosen> I did the exact same thing haha
[5:14:03] <%Dingus_Tickler> Waow
[5:14:08] <Tisaric> all the bug noises are top notch
[5:14:11] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Not the children
[5:14:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I fucking love the voices in this game so god damn much
[5:14:20] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Every single one
[5:14:23] <nexoosen> If I CAN tie a loose end early, why would i not?
[5:14:24] <Rostichenburg> Midwife's chomping noise is so adorable
[5:14:25] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> They sound like they were so much fun to recrd

[5:14:54] <%Divryne> Huge dragon.
[5:14:57] <+gantz_zero> some kind of Mothershroom
[5:14:57] <Tisaric> I think they just got a ton of their family and friends to record the voice lines and they're all great
[5:15:07] <pebblypirate> but whats the pale wyrm pat?
[5:15:15] <Aixenn> shes got a lot to be proud

[5:15:56] <Zanicedg> Go to Bed!!!!!!!!!!
[5:16:01] <EMP_Ike_Turner> why would the infection go here
[5:16:03] <%Dingus_Tickler> @frostmass22 I thought Pat’s dick was called Nidhogg
[5:16:03] <Aixenn> dude the deepnest was so scary the first time i went through it
[5:16:07] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat you also need timestop
[5:16:18] <Tisaric> Deepnest is way too far out for the infection to spread that quickly
[5:16:21] <Rostichenburg> He can get to the secret are in the Weaver's Den though
[5:16:24] <+FrostMass22> @dingus_tickler It has many names
[5:16:30] <Zanicedg> It's bed time.
[5:16:42] <+Camail> remember to put your TP at a stag station
[5:16:44] <%Divryne> No it's Kingdom's Edge time.
[5:16:47] <%Divryne> apatDab
[5:16:48] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat when you're not doing boss runs probably keep your teleportal at a stag station or something
[5:16:49] <Rostichenburg> Dream Gate back up
[5:16:52] <Bendy_V> Use the teleport to get closer
[5:16:53] <+drakthebest> @angriestpat cap off stream with dream version of soul master?
[5:16:55] <%stigna1> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[5:16:55] <%Dingus_Tickler> @frostmass22 He probably calls it the World Serpent too
[5:16:56] <fazoburquina> Dream gate, pat
[5:16:59] <$Mendin> Pat your dreamgate is at the top of fungal realm
[5:17:02] <+gantz_zero> maybe they eat it
[5:17:05] <Zanicedg> @Divryne No.
[5:17:09] <pectusumbra> determination
[5:17:09] <%Divryne> LUL
[5:17:12] <CptBritches> They are strong boys
[5:17:14] <KatabolicRage> >fungal
[5:17:16] <SatansDick1> theyre not
[5:17:19] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Spores are more of a yellowy
[5:17:23] <nexoosen> infection is more orangey
[5:17:24] <%Divryne> Spores are just another living thing.
[5:17:24] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Maybe lime-yellow at best
[5:17:28] <%stigna1> Fungi are green, infection is orange.
[5:17:29] <KaiserMario> It's the power of prayer
[5:17:29] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat So the Fog Canyon entrance in Fungal Wastes takes you to side of the canyon you haven't been to yet
[5:17:30] <%Divryne> Like a race.
[5:17:33] <Tisaric> the fungal boys aren't infected I believe
[5:17:36] <pebblypirate> spores are more yellowy
[5:17:36] <%Divryne> A spore race.
[5:17:37] <dandyspider> shrooms and orange infection are different things
[5:17:39] <Rostichenburg> Mushrooms are nocturnal they don'
[5:17:43] <Rostichenburg> t like light
[5:17:56] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The biocurse is worse than mushrooms
[5:18:00] <+gantz_zero> that's an interesting point
[5:18:02] <SatansDick1> the light is a completely different thing
[5:18:04] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> All biocurses are worse than mushrooms
[5:18:19] <%stigna1> Mushrooms ARE biocurses, if RE7 has anything to say about it.
[5:18:20] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Even when the biocurses ARE mushrooms, like in the last of us
[5:18:22] <nexoosen> idk some mushrooms are pretty horrific looking
[5:18:26] <Rostichenburg> Wasn't RE7's biocurse mushroom based?
[5:18:32] <%stigna1> Yeah man, cordyceps yo.
[5:18:34] <pebblypirate> but some are super tasty looking
[5:18:34] <Zanicedg> Go right.
[5:18:36] <SatansDick1> it was mold based
[5:18:39] <$Mendin> That was TLoU
[5:18:50] <nepwar> what a roundabout
[5:18:50] <Rostichenburg> No it was a fungus I'm pretty sure
[5:18:55] <Zanicedg> Did he get the grub to the right?
[5:18:56] <thetechnicalraven> Holy fuck, Pat's still playing
[5:18:58] <%stigna1> Yeah, it was a mold in RE7.
[5:18:59] <%BioApple> they're called molded
[5:19:01] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> RE7 was mold
[5:19:01] <Eresus> the biocurse that afflicts the bugs does nothing to the mushroom people
[5:19:03] <KoyaMusa> yeah, zote
[5:19:03] <custoadian> No, he hasn't gotten it
[5:19:04] <SatansDick1> mold is a fungus
[5:19:17] <thetechnicalraven> What have I missed?
[5:19:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Biocurse only affects animals, not plants/fungi apparently
[5:19:22] <%stigna1> @Eresus They are infected; all that orange they spew is the infection.
[5:19:24] <SatansDick1> but mold isnt mushrooms
[5:19:24] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat might want to leave a dreamgate at a stag station
[5:19:26] <%whistlehunter> Remember when Pat said he'd stop after finishing greenpath?
[5:19:31] <%stigna1> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Nah, the greenpath plants got sick too.
[5:19:38] <joblessbone> hollow knight is a full time job apparently
[5:19:39] <Zanicedg> Go to bed.
[5:19:41] <nexoosen> you can see it in their eyes, mushroom folk have bblack eyes
[5:19:46] <pebblypirate> leave a dreamgate somewhere convinient

[5:19:54] <AtlasMcCoy> Hollow Knight is literally his full time job
[5:19:55] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @stigna1 Ah, yeah I'm stupid. It's like 4 AM, so I'll blame it on that

[5:20:43] <$Tredecian> hollow night
[5:20:48] <joblessbone> I just got done catching up the start of the last stream I missed and you throw another 5 hours at me?
[5:20:51] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat The dreamgate costs nothing to place and shows up on the map. It can be used to fight yourself. Can also be dropped by stag stations to escape places easy. Also, if you strike someone else's strike you parry it. That's why you didn't take damage sometimes.
[5:20:53] <ryu1299> you've got the hollow knight bug
[5:20:55] <Tisaric> this game is fucking phenomonal
[5:20:56] <%whistlehunter> Make Paige play God of War eventually
