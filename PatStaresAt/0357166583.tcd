[0:18:50] <+whiskywolfe> Er, stream dead? Yes no? I cant see anything
[0:18:56] <%chiluzza> i thought pet girl of sakurasou was a bad anime romance but naruto is worse
[0:18:56] <+ogrest> fallout new vegas had ass crafting though
[0:18:57] <%NaddyKack> Okay so whereâ€™s the time stamp that lets me time travel to the gameplay?
[0:18:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Naruto won in the end.
[0:19:01] <ArcticAsylum> yup
[0:19:05] <%onlypuppet> @whiskywolfe nah
[0:19:09] <%Rngiddion> honestly Sakura is to blame for somehow not getting the hint in 20 years
[0:19:09] <%OwlLightningMage> The system is simple though LUL
[0:19:11] <+lexitheshark> The crafting in New Vegas might as well not exist
[0:19:13] <Polengoldur> the only full conversation Sakura ever had with sasuke was actually naruto using the transformation jutsu. think about that. her only convo with her crush wasn't even With him, it was just some kids in a coat
[0:19:19] <+ogrest> Skyrim has better spell crafting than fallout new vegas has crafting
[0:19:23] <majindusto> Naruto got the best girl...HINATA
[0:19:25] <ArcticAsylum> LUL
[0:19:28] <%OwlLightningMage> It's just a straight up upgrade on your items and ammo LUL
[0:19:30] <%sparrrow_> Boruto is a genetic time bomb
[0:19:32] <complicatedclarity> but you love warframe pat it's all crafting
[0:19:32] <TheEnablerr> The only part of Joshua Graham that makes me want to erase him from existence is his line " I have to change these bandages every day". It's the apocalypse. where is he getting sterile bandages. he should be dead.
[0:19:35] <%Nobrev> SIPP

[0:23:27] <%SiameseSneeze> Bitch, New Vegas is the most gray of the modern Fallout Games
[0:23:30] <Polengoldur> 4 had writing?
[0:23:32] <%TombstoneTTromboners> it's good vs evil except the good guys are morally ambiguous and the evil guys are nazis
[0:23:38] <%OwlLightningMage> I feel like you completely missed the point of the factions if that's what you feel LUL
[0:23:41] <ASadFrog> To be fair, isn't a lot of the story being simple due to Bethesda and ZeniMax rushing Obsidian and withholding their pay?
[0:23:42] <alrobot2014> the best part of fallout 76 is when they gave away fallout 1,2, and tactics
[0:23:42] <aeonicvector> you mean failing morality versus effective but wrong barbaracism based in history?
[0:23:44] <%sparrrow_> play Fallout Tacktits
[0:23:45] <laguerrilha> The DLC Lonesome Road have amazing dialogue, best of the whole game in my opinion
[0:23:46] <+ogrest> To be fair, the legion is only evil if you take them out of the context of the world they exist in, consider what you would do to survive if you lived off of mutated plant matter and cockroach meat and there was the promise of some measure of stability.
[0:23:56] <Gruhunchously> @TombstoneTTromboners So, just like real life?
[0:24:04] <TikanZK> The Legion comes off as super evil but when you ask Caesar about his motivations they actually seem a lot more reasonable oddly enough
[0:24:05] <DocMadfox> It's Morally Grey Vs. Morally Grey Vs. Literal rapist Vs. possibly you saying fuck this and taking over
[0:24:07] <+dougrayman> ***
[0:24:09] <Zombrocom> 3 of four factions are pretty grey, the Legion is chaotic evil cept for Caeser himself, but he won't last forever and after that it's fucked
[0:24:11] <%TombstoneTTromboners> @Gruhunchously yes
[0:24:12] <%OwlLightningMage> Both of the factions are deeply flawed in different ways.
[0:24:16] <+dougrayman> damn it, i cant post a clip from the stream?
[0:24:19] <aeonicvector> @ogrest we call those wendsdays in Aussieland
[0:24:20] <%sparrrow_> it was taken care of

[0:28:48] <brunty1234> @AngriestPat Overwatch may be bad but images of Mercy's feet will always be great
[0:28:48] <%PinkieTheEerie> its leauge levels of cancer now
[0:28:49] <Gruhunchously> Everyone has there own explanation of what happened to Overwatch.
[0:28:49] <+TheRealVegerot> i quit overwatch 2 months after it released and i've been extremely happy since, blizzards stance on ultrawide monitors is garbage
[0:28:50] <ASadFrog> I never got into Overwatch, seems like it's only good for the porn.
[0:28:52] <%GwatchaSquatcha> Deal

[0:29:03] <+GoodShotCam> he took quite a while to contemplate the failure of Overwatch
[0:29:07] <HerrDemsus> the thing is, the game was rigged from the start
[0:29:08] <%FrostMass22> Overwatch is fine but it can never be great because of Blizzard micromanaging
[0:29:11] <ASadFrog> @SiameseSneeze You poor thing
[0:29:14] <+ogrest> @SiameseSneeze why would you live in oregon's most hated city though?

[0:29:31] <Worldbrand> It wasn't me but I'll take credit
[0:29:31] <brunty1234> are Blizz just ocmpletely incapable of balancing a game or something
[0:29:32] <%sparrrow_> harada will save dbfz, it's not like he has a shirt that says "don't ask me for shit"
[0:29:32] <%GwatchaSquatcha> But aye he pronounced my name right
[0:29:35] <%CurrySauseBandit> What's so bad about Overwatch now? Just new characters or the total revamp of characters and nerfs
[0:29:40] <Worldbrand> Good! 1 and 4 are the good ones
[0:29:42] <AirlineFood74> @ThePuddingDead it's closed

[0:30:55] <ScreamingMeat> Eh
[0:30:58] <+Freelance_Astronaut> If 4 was terrible then what was 76
[0:30:59] <+ogrest> @SiameseSneeze they literally let antifa do whatever they want though, and they hold a hegemonic political control of a state that is largely right wing simply because it's a meme city people who aren't even from oregon move to constantly to ruin our state
[0:30:59] <%Reizie_Etherealm> REAL SHIT?!
[0:31:00] <martmartez> maybe he is rich or stream whale?
[0:31:03] <Polengoldur> @BlackJack607 thats like saying dark souls 2 wasn;t a bad game. sure, compared to all videogames its well above average. compared to the rest of its series? Trash
[0:31:07] <%OwlLightningMage> 76 is a joke
[0:31:10] <Darmarock> Fallout 4 is a Far Cry
