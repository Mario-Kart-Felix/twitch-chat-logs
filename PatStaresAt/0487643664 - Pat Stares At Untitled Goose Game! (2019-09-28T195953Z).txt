[0:26:00] <%SoFarFetched> @SSaryn I think I remember some articles saying they are trying to get rid of cursive because it's not really needed. Since I gues everything is going digital is why.

[0:27:00] <WhoInvitedZach> goose will never reach that truth
[0:27:02] <Farrah_Waltz> Geese fly in a “V” formation. If one goose is injured, other geese will stay with it until it dies or can rejoin the flock.

[0:29:17] <Farrah_Waltz> Many people keep geese as pets and they prove to be very good pets. They keep the lawn short, clear away weeds and they can act as good as a guard dog. They are very loyal and will follow you around like a dog.
