Man I wish Japan could have kept the part of china they occupied during WW2. That way they'd have a demographic a bit further away and game devs would have to care about netcode. Fuck I just wanna play GBFV!
[0:24:01] <%BubbaRands> Rather take damage the face than the orb... Yeah I know how it sounds

[1:28:40] <%BoxNavy> you die instantly
[1:28:40] <LilacsandFreedom> goes boom!
[1:28:40] <%shocknawful> sounds like exploding corpses
[1:28:41] <%Typhaeon> Considering the fuse, they'll drop grenades seems to be the idea
[1:28:41] <%BubbaRands> There's a "J" in Jackie so close enough
[1:28:41] <%bevyrage> it means they explode pat. that skull is a bomb
[1:28:41] <%Wrangler117> they will explode
[1:28:42] <ergulor> explode death most likely
[1:28:43] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt the firebomb curse from Hades
[1:28:44] <restingbones> Judging by the icon, they will drop a bomb
[1:28:46] <%asgard147> monkaS

[1:32:09] <prof_nerd> "circling the wagons" is the one I retch at.
[1:32:10] <SomeOtherNeb> never touch anyone's base
[1:32:10] <@SoFarFetched> "Let's touch bases on that later"
[1:32:11] <Manwad> just tryin' to touch tips
[1:32:11] <%asgard147> doodSick doodBarf

[1:32:25] <$RealThiele> beepbeep
[1:32:30] <%BoxNavy> cmere big man
[1:32:34] <+BringBackSempai> that guy hits like a hand-truck
[1:32:43] <%shocknawful> jobossbow?
[1:32:45] <Doofmaster> in tabletop miniature games touching base means they can melee attack each other
[1:32:47] <dukenux> i'm not touching Pat's base, even if Paige allows it
[1:32:51] <heartlesshealer> his name is Jelly <3
[1:32:53] <%TheWinged7> whats clap back do?

[1:33:09] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:33:14] <braincraft> Do you suppose the expensive health power-up gives you an extra heart?
[1:33:15] <%AncelDeLambert> touching base means you can't be "it"
[1:33:19] <%AncelDeLambert> that's the rule
[1:33:23] <+BringBackSempai> hand-truck kun!
[1:33:23] <@Mechz71> SPEEN
[1:33:25] <%TheWinged7> pat you can z target

[1:33:36] <%shocknawful> segways would have been funnier
[1:33:49] <%bluetocho13> just got here is he playing the game well?
[1:33:49] <%bevyrage> @TrollKing96 touch base is a term derived from the game kick the can, where you'd be able to free everyone who got captured by touching the base or kicking the can. industry speak has it used as a means to say 'checking in'
[1:34:03] <%AncelDeLambert> segways are what asshole EXECUTIVES ride on
[1:34:04] <$RealThiele> he is playing the game, i cant tell if well

[1:37:33] <heartlesshealer> seeing dogs is usually the good part of the day
[1:37:34] <BlacSoul> combat

[2:40:13] <0rond> the controller works but mouse is way smoother
[2:40:15] <%TheWinged7> its not action based, play mouse
[2:40:18] <Louie_Salmon> I've never used a controller with this
[2:40:22] <heartlesshealer> yeah, needs controller to be seen on startup
[2:40:22] <%AzureGale> What is this Harry Potter riff

[2:45:29] <SomeOtherNeb> it's totally drag and drop
[2:45:30] <Tisaric> you can drag and drop though
[2:45:32] <zenanon> there's a toggle for not needing to target if there's only one target
[2:45:33] <heartlesshealer> It's either/or

[2:45:50] <%linSP> the art is serviceable at worst but man is this game satisfying
[2:45:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't drag and drop on Switch
[2:45:53] <%Mendin> Pat read your cards
[2:45:55] <reonome> its drag and drop

[2:46:00] <%SirGO0SE> psaCaw psaCaw
[2:46:05] <+PharosOfLight> fast mode is good
[2:46:05] <$RealThiele> it saves your place in the spire
[2:46:08] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah I don't know about that targeting thing
[2:46:10] <$RealThiele> you can relog into a run
[2:46:19] <Tisaric> it's not a literal option it's just built in to the mouse option
[2:46:24] <cat5kable> I play on console, controller input is nice. A bit less Repetitive Stress Injury on the wrist
[2:46:24] <SomeOtherNeb> yeah, just save and quit
[2:46:28] <@SSaryn> Yeah, each room goes back to the beginning.
[2:46:28] <%kknutson4> vulnterable is super good
[2:46:29] <heartlesshealer> ^^^
[2:46:34] <heartlesshealer> built into mouse option
[2:46:34] <whazat> i think it might start the fight over from the beginning, but that is okay
[2:46:35] <SomeOtherNeb> no worries
[2:46:37] <Zebroneath> no prob, Pat
[2:46:40] <+gumballwizard> fast mode is pretty nice to speed animations up
[2:46:44] <TheHeroAppears> just play with controller
[2:46:45] <%squidking96> oh it ssaryn
[2:46:48] <%squidking96> he smell
[2:46:50] <%crimsonharvest> I wish they didnt have to use cards as the aesthetic, a set of options but cards make it feel kind of fake to me
[2:46:53] <%Alpha8087> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:46:53] <+oda_flobunaga> why not Thronebreaker?
[2:46:56] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> psaDogchamp pet me, Pat!
[2:46:58] <heartlesshealer> Mouse enbales BOTH drag&drop as well as click-to-click
[2:46:58] <Louie_Salmon> I've never tried controller, would probably be fine 8 guess
[2:46:59] <$RealThiele> people made a bunch of jank classes for this game with mods
[2:47:02] <@SSaryn> fuk u @squidking96
[2:47:13] <butthurtdave> also if you feel like cheating, if you fuck up a fight you can close the game and it'll put you back at the start of the fight
[2:47:18] <TheHeroAppears> people are stupid
[2:47:19] <heartlesshealer> Yeah controller is easier on wrist
[2:47:25] <%Bailey__gaming> This is my fave rougelike
[2:47:26] <%darthfodder> Pat's crazy
[2:47:27] <@SSaryn> God dang it.
[2:47:29] <heartlesshealer> controller just needs to be ON when you start game
[2:47:30] <%squidking96> ha
[2:47:30] <%AzureGale> ok
[2:47:34] <%darthfodder> mouse is way better haha
[2:47:35] <%SirKeigan> That was the entire reason you got dog
[2:47:36] <%asgard147> "Dad....quit it....I'm tired....zzzzzzz" psaDogchamp
[2:47:38] <0rond> when you want to go quickly, which you will, mouse will be way more fluid
[2:47:38] <%SirGO0SE> can you one hand with controller too?
[2:47:41] <$RealThiele> Bailey which class is your fav
[2:47:47] <@SSaryn> CAW CAW
[2:47:49] <reonome> CAW CAW
[2:47:49] <Hydrapissed> its a card game u people need to chill with this kbm bs for real lol
[2:47:51] <butthurtdave> cmon pat, this isn't a first person shooter, you dont need your controller
[2:47:56] <dapperskeleton69> CAW CAW
[2:47:57] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> psaCaw psaCaw
[2:47:58] <Tisaric> the appeal of mouse is one hand
[2:48:03] <%Toynota10> CAW CAW
[2:48:08] <Tisaric> but yeah it really doesn't matter
[2:48:09] <butthurtdave> NO
[2:48:10] <SomeOtherNeb> @PatStaresAt remember - this character heals 6 damage at the end of each fight
[2:48:15] <SomeOtherNeb> you can tank some damage
[2:48:16] <$RealThiele> not right cause items
[2:48:18] <+tacostarvedbeast> idk why but playing the silent is soooooo much more fun than that other classes imo
[2:48:24] <reonome> ironchad LUL
[2:48:25] <%SirGO0SE> after each fight ends
[2:48:29] <morow1ec> It's been so long since i saw this game without turbo mode it's so fucking slow
[2:48:31] <%linSP> you get hp at the end of battle
[2:48:33] <SomeOtherNeb> you got lethal
[2:48:35] <heartlesshealer> You can hover over yourself and enemies to see status effects
[2:48:36] <Doofmaster> 9 because vulnerable
[2:48:36] <bleugh> iron chad?
[2:48:37] <$RealThiele> killlll
[2:48:38] <+gumballwizard> vuln
[2:48:40] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Vulnerable
[2:48:41] <reonome> because he's vulnerable
[2:48:41] <%crimsonharvest> vulnerable means you have to do math
[2:48:42] <%Agami23> did 9 because vuln
[2:48:43] <GPAlpha> Yeah, Ironclad is your big beefy boi tank
[2:48:45] <%AzureGale> SIX. SIX SIX. THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST
[2:48:46] <+Lugia0123> vulnerable does +50%
[2:48:47] <whazat> Vulnerable is a 50% damage buff, the number of Vulnerable is how many turns it lasts
[2:48:49] <%kknutson4> You get all the loot
[2:48:51] <Louie_Salmon> It shows modified damage when you hover
[2:48:52] <butthurtdave> you get all of them
[2:48:54] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt btw, there is a FAST option in the Settings
[2:48:56] <%Spydurman> card shows you what actual damage will be
[2:48:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Iron Clad gets HP, others not so much
[2:48:57] <+metalwolfchaos> Yo brok
[2:48:58] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt you get all of these

[2:49:10] <@SSaryn> Unless otherwise stated, you get all of them.
[2:49:13] <+TopTierHarley> you get all
[2:49:16] <SailingSaturn> @tacostarvedbeast unfortunately for me I was stuck for so long on her trying to beat a run, I've developed a bias against them even though I like the cards LUL
[2:49:16] <heartlesshealer> generous like that <3
[2:49:21] <+tacostarvedbeast> clash is pretty good
[2:49:21] <$RealThiele> sometimes you DONT want loot
[2:49:23] <mellorolo> but 6 ate 9
[2:49:25] <+Rofiarf> feel free to skip if nothing is good
[2:49:25] <%kknutson4> Clash is garbo
[2:49:27] <%linSP> perfect stroke
[2:49:28] <Louie_Salmon> Do you want hot tips on cards?
[2:49:30] <%RoggleJr> Hover your mouse over enemies to see their intent.
[2:49:32] <+metalwolfchaos> brok its thor where is my hammer
[2:49:33] <+Mrbaconator> those are all good
[2:49:33] <reonome> i hate clash
[2:49:33] <$RealThiele> perfect
[2:49:33] <SomeOtherNeb> Uppercut is real good but so is Clash
[2:49:33] <%SirGO0SE> all decent
[2:49:34] <VritraReiRei> I Vote 2
[2:49:35] <+TopTierHarley> Clash sucks
[2:49:35] <%SvenHolgersson> Clash ain't great
[2:49:39] <%Visorak6> Uppercut
[2:49:43] <TheFakeBob> clash is amazing
[2:49:44] <lloyddboy> perf strike is a TRAP
[2:49:46] <Manwad> he doesn't know LUL
[2:49:47] <Tisaric> clash is only garbage later in ascension
[2:49:48] <+Mrbaconator> yer all nuts clash can be great
[2:49:49] <%Mendin> Clash is FANTASTIC but you go tta build around it slightly
[2:49:50] <0rond> clash is good in the right decks
[2:49:50] <alephalpha> decks in this agme cna get nutty
[2:49:51] <heartlesshealer> hello today
[2:49:51] <$RealThiele> clash ina hand with 3 defends F
[2:49:54] <Tisaric> clash has it's uses
[2:49:55] <butthurtdave> I forget, what are the conditions for unlocking the other three characters?
[2:49:57] <+tacostarvedbeast> 0 point cards are great unless ur fighting a certain something at the end
[2:50:01] <@SSaryn> Clash is really not that fantastic, but sure.
[2:50:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt just remember, the bigger your deck, the harder it is to get to your good cards when you need them and focus on a strategy
[2:50:04] <Doofmaster> clash takes a serious dive at A10+
[2:50:05] <$RealThiele> rug NOT for sale
[2:50:06] <%kknutson4> Perf strike is good on basic 0 ascension runs
[2:50:08] <whazat> he's new, give him some time to figure it out
[2:50:10] <heartlesshealer> god I miss dogs
[2:50:11] <$RealThiele> FLAME BRO
[2:50:11] <%Ne1son> Oh boy I forgot how bad STS chat is
[2:50:12] <%SirGO0SE> gotta remember he doesnt have a lot of cards unlocked
[2:50:14] <%asgard147> "Dad....you woke me up..." psaDogchamp
[2:50:15] <aeonicvector> Clash big garbo imop
[2:50:23] <Tisaric> but yeah welcome to sts chat
[2:50:23] <Doofmaster> clash is fab in act 1 if you can play it..
[2:50:23] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Oh cool, slay the spire
[2:50:24] <+zalonar> Oh, he getting big
[2:50:26] <0rond> @RealThiele play 3 defends + clash it's more damage than 2 strikes
[2:50:28] <%Mendin> Finesse or Shrug both good
[2:50:30] <SomeOtherNeb> <3
[2:50:33] <%Ascethetic> Ascethetic subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[2:50:34] <+TopTierHarley> Clash is garb, don't buy
[2:50:34] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:50:36] <%Visorak6> finesse
[2:50:37] <+tacostarvedbeast> i wouldn't spend money on clash though
[2:50:38] <%kknutson4> Good discount on the Flame Barrier
[2:50:41] <%afronooch> yeah StS chat sucks
[2:50:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> better known as deckbuilding 101, bigger decks are harder to control
[2:50:41] <%AzureGale> I wanna play with dog ears :(
[2:50:47] <Louie_Salmon> @ne1son I mean I assume he wants pro gamer tips until stated otherwise
[2:50:49] <lloyddboy> My finger points!
[2:50:50] <VritraReiRei> Shrug it Off is good if you can upgrade it @PatStaresAt
[2:50:51] <SomeOtherNeb> Shrug and Barrier are real good imo
[2:50:51] <$RealThiele> Flame barrier vs that one boss
[2:50:52] <reonome> das a good card
[2:50:53] <braincraft> Finesse is good because it pays for itself. It's just free.
[2:50:54] <butthurtdave> I'd save money
[2:50:57] <%Grayhammatter> the bomb does decent damage
[2:50:59] <0rond> shrug is really good
[2:51:01] <bigmorpho> Pat shut the fuck up
[2:51:01] <%SirGO0SE> you can check your deck in the top right
[2:51:08] <%Bailey__gaming> @realthiele I like the watcher a lot but based defect is my fave
[2:51:08] <%chiazam> Finesse?
[2:51:08] <+agumon9000> Saving money is good
[2:51:09] <braincraft> Shrug it off also at least pays for its draw.
[2:51:09] <%Ascethetic> @patstaresat sup pat, how are things?
[2:51:10] <%kknutson4> Flame Barrier is good
[2:51:12] <+pectusumbra> flame barrier or shrug it off, all else is eh
[2:51:12] <%SirGO0SE> if you want to start looking for synergy
[2:51:16] <%za7az> flame barrier good
[2:51:21] <heartlesshealer> So tip: If you see an artifact in the shop, you'll probably never see it again in that particular run. So when you got money, choose what you really want
[2:51:23] <braincraft> It's just a straight upgrade over basic blocks.
[2:51:23] <0rond> asc 0 you can make pretty much everything work
[2:51:26] <%Bailey__gaming> remove a card
[2:51:28] <$RealThiele> defunct is hot, silent here im a big discard strat fan
[2:51:31] <%Ne1son> @Louie_Salmon Oh no I just miss the inevitable shitshow that is card recommendations
[2:51:38] <SomeOtherNeb> Perfected Strike and block
[2:51:41] <butthurtdave> I think if you hit them it cancels their attacks
[2:51:41] <lloyddboy> perf and def
[2:51:42] <+metalwolfchaos> brok ill give you a goat for the hammer
[2:51:46] <%uncle_grumps> Git 'em!
[2:51:46] <%crimsonharvest> but if you hit them, they roll up?
[2:51:46] <%Grayhammatter> might as well kill one
[2:51:47] <heartlesshealer> that should be it for tips since Pat has brain. Everything else should be goblin-related
[2:51:48] <butthurtdave> been a while since i played tho
[2:51:48] <%kknutson4> u can murder 1
[2:51:52] <%darthfodder> I like all 4 classes, Ironclad is my least favorite though.
[2:51:52] <$RealThiele> strike mercs one dang
[2:51:54] <%Bailey__gaming> FLUFFY
[2:51:56] <reonome> OHKO PogChamp
[2:51:57] <TheHeroAppears> chat just saying what to do LUL
[2:52:14] <+TopTierHarley> lol
[2:52:18] <SomeOtherNeb> DOG STREAM DOG STREAM DOG STREAM
[2:52:22] <heartlesshealer> I like orb, but yeah all four of the classes are good
[2:52:24] <+gumballwizard> yeah slay the spire gets a lot of backseating
[2:52:24] <$RealThiele> tbh pat hates card games so im shocked this is happening
[2:52:29] <Doofmaster> seeing lots of jank advice in chat already tho
[2:52:31] <Louie_Salmon> All block wears off, for both sides
[2:52:33] <+DonnieAdonis> Hi Pat
[2:52:36] <%R3Roundabout> Chat is giving advice, lots of which is obviously wrong
[2:52:37] <%linSP> wow pat is smrt
[2:52:38] <%SvenHolgersson> DED BUGS
[2:52:39] <%SvenHolgersson> YEYEYEYE
[2:52:41] <%kknutson4> But he loved Runeterra
[2:52:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> If you'd like, you can toggle "Fast Mode" in the settings. All this does is speed up animations so turns go by faster"
[2:52:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> strangely I played a lot more Steamworld Quest over this when they both came out
[2:52:44] <+DonnieAdonis> Hi Chat
[2:52:47] <lloyddboy> Free Shrugs
[2:52:50] <+Kinoskae> YOU FOOL
[2:52:52] <mellorolo> chat! doggo!
[2:52:52] <$RealThiele> Chat rememebr his card pool doesnt exist yet
[2:52:52] <ergulor> wow
[2:52:54] <%Mendin> Didn't even look at Cleave Kappa
[2:52:57] <+Kinoskae> Cleave OP
[2:53:01] <ergulor> this feels so slow without fast mode
[2:53:03] <0rond> the urge to backseat is strong, we must all exercise self control
[2:53:05] <%Visorak6> Fast mode is useful once you understand the gist of what's going on
[2:53:08] <@SSaryn> @R3Roundabout Definitely gonna happen a lot when people don't even play Ascensions.
[2:53:14] <SomeOtherNeb> Cleave PepeHands
[2:53:16] <+TopTierHarley> why block there
[2:53:18] <%Bailey__gaming> Cleave is best card
[2:53:18] <butthurtdave> Pat's gonna have a breakdown when he gets to the three Dazed things in that one Elite combat
[2:53:19] <+metalwolfchaos> brok what do you want for he hammer
[2:53:21] <+pectusumbra> the negative effect will always be a non damage thing
[2:53:22] <%SirGO0SE> psaDogchamp but i wanna
[2:53:23] <%DedlokPM> rooLick
[2:53:24] <%crimsonharvest> bash first for the vuln yeah

[2:53:35] <heartlesshealer> puppy <3
[2:53:36] <0rond> @SSaryn on the other hand, this is asc 0, which means you can win with pretty much anything
[2:53:39] <%DedlokPM> rooLick psaWhat @PatStaresAt
[2:53:40] <SomeOtherNeb> @SSaryn I mean...you're not wrong but Pat isn't playing ascension either
[2:53:40] <$RealThiele> Custom mode killed the need for ascension you can just make your own punishment
[2:53:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> quick, use your Pendulum Summon!
[2:53:48] <%asgard147> "Mom, Dad woke me up" psaDogchamp
[2:53:56] <SomeOtherNeb> so do we
[2:54:01] <Doofmaster> @RealThiele you can turn on ascension in custom anyway ;)
[2:54:03] <+TopTierHarley> XYZ summon
[2:54:06] <rekinom> Do you think 'Gief thinks Pat is talking to him when he's talking to us?
[2:54:06] <heartlesshealer> he a good boy <3
[2:54:08] <Cosairen> dont worry pat i love your dog too
[2:54:09] <@SSaryn> Didn't say they were all wrong now did I, he's just starting out, it's not like he really needs to get advice unless he otherwise asks anyway.
[2:54:09] <$RealThiele> oof
[2:54:12] <%Bailey__gaming> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[2:54:18] <%linSP> angerey
[2:54:19] <%Kinoskae> @PatStaresAt If you click the card and don't select the enemy yet, it will show you what the damage will be with the vulnerable debuff
[2:54:19] <%SirGO0SE> @RealThiele i like seeing how much better my friends are than me tho LUL
[2:54:20] <$KnivesEve> wait hold the phone. Pat loves the dog!? wha?
[2:54:20] <lloyddboy> BECOME ANGERY
[2:54:22] <@SSaryn> He's literally just learning cards too.
[2:54:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> quick what does Pot of Greed do
[2:54:25] <%kknutson4> Thunderclap those cheeks
[2:54:26] <mellorolo> look at his sad droopy face
[2:54:26] <+TopTierHarley> Saryn is right
[2:54:27] <%crimsonharvest> now you dont have to get a card, if your deck is getting full or confusing you can skip if you need to
[2:54:27] <braincraft> scritch pupper
[2:54:27] <raveous> how many runs has pat done so far?
[2:54:30] <%Ascethetic> CLAP THEM CHEEKS
[2:54:32] <%Visorak6> thunderclap is strong
[2:54:32] <wannabemoogle> He yawn
[2:54:35] <+pectusumbra> ah this fuck
[2:54:37] <$RealThiele> clap perfect is a strong combo
[2:54:37] <+TopTierHarley> this is his first
[2:54:38] <heartlesshealer> Slaver
[2:54:40] <Doofmaster> @raveous just started
[2:54:43] <SomeOtherNeb> bash
[2:54:45] <%DedlokPM> @raveous literally first run
[2:54:48] <raveous> oh noice
[2:54:51] <jellssssss20> I stupid Twitter man, how dare Pat hate and abuse dog!
[2:54:53] <butthurtdave> Block doesn't stop negative effects from hitting you
[2:54:55] <%SirGO0SE> yeah pats smart hes figuring it out. hes just looking for UI tips i think
[2:54:55] <%Ne1son> A witch and negative
[2:55:04] <%Bailey__gaming> 0 cost cards are great
[2:55:08] <$RealThiele> First run, first character, no unlocks yet
[2:55:10] <wannabemoogle> Aww he sleepy
[2:55:12] <EdictEngine> He's gonna have a 60 card deck before a snake plant tears him in half
[2:55:17] <SomeOtherNeb> so you do 75% dmg but that damage does +50% Enjoy MATH
[2:55:22] <Cosairen> is there a mana pool or something we cant see cause of the overlay?
[2:55:23] <+metalwolfchaos> Brok its thor what do you want for the HAMMER
[2:55:24] <braincraft> Literally his first time touching the game.
[2:55:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Pro-tip: play cards to win
[2:55:25] <%R3Roundabout> People are telling him what to think and they have no idea what they are talking about. AKA, chat is being chat
[2:55:34] <%SirGO0SE> and thats how we learn about that @EdictEngine LUL
[2:55:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> 0 costs cards can be useful but run out of usefulness later
[2:55:38] <LoneFonte> @EdictEngine and thats fine
[2:55:40] <$RealThiele> cards games are basically MATH so yea
[2:55:40] <SomeOtherNeb> @Cosairen yes. He has 3 energy per turn right now
[2:55:43] <+pectusumbra> @Cosairen yes its in the bottom left
[2:55:59] <Cosairen> ok cool
[2:55:59] <EdictEngine> Yep, no shame in learning
[2:56:02] <%SirGO0SE> scrape deck would like to see you in its office @ShinobiPhoenix
[2:56:04] <heartlesshealer> I never use Combust, but it can be okay
[2:56:04] <lloyddboy> BUST Kreygasm
[2:56:08] <butthurtdave> pommel
[2:56:09] <0rond> combust is... not great
[2:56:09] <jellssssss20> @cosairen yup in the upper right corner, that glowing thing says x/3
[2:56:10] <$RealThiele> meh combust
[2:56:10] <SomeOtherNeb> I like pommel strike
[2:56:11] <+TopTierHarley> just let him learn
[2:56:12] <%chiazam> Strike
[2:56:12] <%linSP> cum bust
[2:56:14] <%crimsonharvest> yo pommel strike sounds good
[2:56:19] <+pectusumbra> pommel would be my choice
[2:56:19] <VritraReiRei> Pommel Strike powers up your other card
[2:56:21] <$RealThiele> pommel would add to perfect strike
[2:56:21] <%Visorak6> pommel strike is good
[2:56:24] <+Dingalow> Dingalow subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[2:56:25] <Mr_Strut> Combust seems good with passive health regen
[2:56:25] <%Spydurman> pommel strike
[2:56:25] <Tisaric> man I haven't played this like a year or so but I forgot some of the crazy combos you can do with ironclad
[2:56:25] <mellorolo> hHahaha cum- bust
[2:56:25] <%SirGO0SE> pommel strike FUCKS
[2:56:31] <pillygram> card draw good
[2:56:37] <%Spydurman> Smith
[2:56:38] <%Agami23> i believe pommel strike increases the power of perfected strike
[2:56:40] <%Visorak6> smith
[2:56:40] <$RealThiele> smith yeye
[2:56:40] <%SirGO0SE> click it and you can see
[2:56:41] <%crimsonharvest> you get a preview
[2:56:43] <@SSaryn> You can look at all of them when you click once.
[2:56:44] <%Agami23> it will show you
[2:56:44] <butthurtdave> either increases its effects or reduces its cost
[2:56:44] <rekinom> number go up
[2:56:44] <+pectusumbra> you can see before you choose\
[2:56:45] <braincraft> Pommel strike, another straight upgrade over basic cards.
[2:56:45] <Doofmaster> you can preview the upgrade before you lock it in
[2:56:45] <LoneFonte> press once to see
[2:56:46] <reonome> you can see when you select it
[2:56:47] <Twoiis> It'll depend on the card.
[2:56:48] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt you can click on it to see upgrade and cancel
[2:56:48] <%SirGO0SE> theres a preview and you can back out
[2:56:49] <SomeOtherNeb> you get to see the effects before confirming @PatStaresAt
[2:56:49] <+SpiritOfOdin> if you click it shows you
[2:56:49] <%Ne1son> select one and find out
[2:56:51] <heartlesshealer> I loved when they put in confirming for smithing
[2:56:51] <+Rofiarf> it tells you
[2:56:51] <$RealThiele> @Agami23 yep
[2:56:52] <%Spydurman> You get a preview
[2:56:53] <+pectusumbra> but number go up in short
[2:56:54] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> select on e to preview
[2:56:55] <%Dingalow> Why did Twitch think I was unsubscribed???
[2:56:55] <%chiazam> Perfected Strike?
[2:56:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @SirGO0SE some kind of focus on cheap cards for quick aggro deck?
[2:56:56] <braincraft> Though once you upgrade it, uppercut is also good.
[2:56:57] <@SoFarFetched> POT OF GREED
[2:56:57] <+metalwolfchaos> thor is gonna be jesus again at this rate
[2:56:58] <%Visorak6> +damage -cost or +effect
[2:56:58] <%Bailey__gaming> @cosairen you get 3 energy but cards can cost 1 2 or 3+ energy a
[2:56:58] <%crimsonharvest> sometimes the cost goes down, depends on the card
[2:57:00] <%linSP> number go up
[2:57:02] <jellssssss20> Gotta love folks in chat back seating since they’ve played the game for years and this is his first time
[2:57:09] <cat5kable> upgrades reduce cost, or increase damage, etc
[2:57:09] <%kknutson4> Good choice
[2:57:10] <%Grayhammatter> big number go up
[2:57:10] <%Jekado> yeah card advantage is important
[2:57:15] <%Bailey__gaming> NUMBER GO UP
[2:57:16] <$RealThiele> bash is very good to upgrade cause of debuff
[2:57:16] <braincraft> But if he's already got perfected strike he should take any pommels that drop.
[2:57:16] <%Mendin> A third turn of Vulnerable from Bash is also solid
[2:57:17] <%SirGO0SE> you can check the upgrades for a card when you pick it too @PatStaresAt
[2:57:20] <+DonnieAdonis> Thunderclap
[2:57:20] <%Spydurman> good choice
[2:57:20] <@SSaryn> Do it.
[2:57:22] <%crimsonharvest> now the real time begins
[2:57:23] <@SSaryn> Fucking do it
[2:57:24] <butthurtdave> this is why you want AoE cards
[2:57:24] <heartlesshealer> many small slims
[2:57:25] <%kknutson4> oops no aoe
[2:57:26] <lloyddboy> QUICK SHRUG
[2:57:26] <+gumballwizard> oof this fight
[2:57:28] <TheHeroAppears> slime time
[2:57:28] <0rond> THUNDER
[2:57:28] <Doofmaster> @jellssssss20 and they aren't even doing it well for the most part
[2:57:29] <%uncle_grumps> Git 'em!
[2:57:29] <LoneFonte> big blocks
[2:57:30] <+pectusumbra> shrug
[2:57:33] <thesanderdc> style on them Pat
[2:57:34] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah this is a spooky combat
[2:57:34] <+Rofiarf> shrug it off for the fire wall hopefully
[2:57:35] <purplelemons> Defence clap clap
[2:57:35] <reonome> i hate this fight
[2:57:36] <mellorolo> STOOPP IIIT!
[2:57:37] <Cosairen> play cards till they or you die
[2:57:37] <%chiazam> 21 DAMAGE
[2:57:38] <%AzureGale> GOOD LUCK
[2:57:39] <+agumon9000> Kill the baby sliems
[2:57:39] <$lotharrio> 21 damage incoming.
[2:57:40] <%SirGO0SE> as a rule of thumb, if you plan to draw do it first
[2:57:42] <$RealThiele> you got 16 block
[2:57:43] <ergulor> 21
[2:57:43] <@SSaryn> Do psaBig Math
[2:57:43] <%Visorak6> shrug try for aoe?
[2:57:45] <reonome> this is why you get aoe attacks LUL
[2:57:47] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Do a big combo
[2:57:47] <%linSP> guys stop backseating, also use your pot pat
[2:57:47] <%Bailey__gaming> SLIME GANG
[2:57:52] <%Mendin> THEY CAN'T HURT YOU IF THEY'RE DEAD PATRICK
[2:57:59] <SomeOtherNeb> I hate this fight
[2:58:00] <braincraft> You came to the wrong neighborhood.
[2:58:07] <%SirGO0SE> CLAP
[2:58:08] <$RealThiele> no debuffs hes lucky
[2:58:12] <+pectusumbra> cleave is good in this fight
[2:58:14] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt i suggest turning on the Fast option in the settings. it just speeds up the animations
[2:58:16] <%Bailey__gaming> if only we had a cleave
[2:58:17] <$RealThiele> CLAP
[2:58:17] <%SirGO0SE> perfect draw
[2:58:17] <+Rofiarf> that too
[2:58:18] <heartlesshealer> =)
[2:58:23] <CappuccinoGuil> I love going Paper Cut build with the green character LUL
[2:58:24] <+DonnieAdonis> yeah
[2:58:25] <%SirGO0SE> literally
[2:58:27] <braincraft> One whirlwind just solves this problem.
[2:58:29] <jellssssss20> Did you just “pikachu I choose you” that card?
[2:58:30] <%Visorak6> yeah thats the play
[2:58:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Mendin except for death-casting monsters...
[2:58:40] <0rond> this is why whirlwind is 10/10
[2:58:46] <%linSP> luck IS a skill
[2:58:47] <$RealThiele> weak-ass bitch
[2:58:48] <%crimsonharvest> kill one
[2:58:58] <lloyddboy> perfect block!
[2:59:00] <%SvenHolgersson> Is good
[2:59:01] <%kknutson4> It's great on mobile
[2:59:01] <Tisaric> it's extremely addicting
[2:59:01] <SomeOtherNeb> it's the BEST
[2:59:03] <+pectusumbra> its a fantastic game
[2:59:05] <%Agami23> theres some really cool builds
[2:59:06] <%iamnolionheart> Howdy fellow gamers what's poppin
[2:59:07] <butthurtdave> and you've got three more characters to unlock
[2:59:07] <%Grayhammatter> yeah, it's pretty good
[2:59:09] <$RealThiele> its Very cool
[2:59:10] <@SSaryn> And surprisingly really slow without Fast Mode wow, it's been a while
[2:59:11] <%Visorak6> It gets NUTS
[2:59:12] <Louie_Salmon> I can't wait for Android
[2:59:13] <0rond> this game is a legit 10/10
[2:59:13] <+pectusumbra> I haven't played it in a while but I put a lot of time in it
[2:59:13] <+agumon9000> This game is very addicting, especially with mods and very salt inducing
[2:59:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> is thiss really Pat's actual first time playing this?
[2:59:14] <%kknutson4> Seems like Woolie's jam
[2:59:14] <whazat> it gets really good once you unlock more and begin finding synergies
[2:59:14] <Thalchampz> slay the spire is gud
[2:59:15] <cat5kable> I'm not a huge fan of the art style but love the game overall
[2:59:18] <Tisaric> it's INCREDIBLY well designed
[2:59:19] <Lophostrix_> *cool little game* I've spent 600+ hours on
[2:59:19] <%crimsonharvest> there are many fun combos and synergies to find, it combines some of the best parts of how isaac does powerups
[2:59:21] <cat5kable> deckbuilding SLAPS
[2:59:22] <Twoiis> I mean, it's aight.
[2:59:22] <+Rofiarf> i thought this was one of the games that triggered your mind goblins>
[2:59:22] <heartlesshealer> Have fun playing it on your own after the stream's over. The other characters are great too <3
[2:59:24] <%Spydurman> I've put almost 60 hours into this, it's a blast
[2:59:28] <jellssssss20> Warrior is so easy wait till ascension +9 runs Kappa Kappa
[2:59:28] <%maenos2> watch pat become addicted to this for two weeks and then never return ala runeterra
[2:59:31] <$RealThiele> Dead branch Exhaust with Corruption muahahaha
[2:59:32] <+metalwolfchaos> brok wake up I just want a hammer
[2:59:33] <%AzureGale> NOW you won
[2:59:35] <@SSaryn> You use it.
[2:59:38] <reonome> its a potion
[2:59:38] <%Agami23> you need to use it
[2:59:38] <lloyddboy> consoomable
[2:59:39] <%kknutson4> It's a potion
[2:59:39] <+Rofiarf> use
[2:59:39] <heartlesshealer> potions = consume
[2:59:40] <$lotharrio> You've had potions.
[2:59:40] <thesanderdc> ue
[2:59:40] <%Grayhammatter> you have to use it
[2:59:41] <Twoiis> Usable. Potions.
[2:59:41] <Louie_Salmon> You use potions
[2:59:41] <rasamune> Consumable potion
[2:59:42] <whazat> you need to use potions mid fight to get the effect
[2:59:42] <%Agami23> its a potion
[2:59:43] <%linSP> you can use potions anytime during combat
[2:59:43] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt X button is potions one time use
[2:59:43] <%Ne1son> Potion you use
[2:59:44] <%SvenHolgersson> You drink it
[2:59:45] <GPAlpha> Potions are your consumables
[2:59:45] <$RealThiele> potions you use
[2:59:46] <+gumballwizard> use in battle
[2:59:46] <+pectusumbra> potions are one time use, but worth using, you get a lot
[2:59:47] <%SirGO0SE> this game will 3-4am you hard
[2:59:47] <%iamnolionheart> It's a consumable potion
[2:59:48] <%Spydurman> onsumeable
[2:59:49] <Doofmaster> you say that now, but then you get frustrated by big numbers later, and either give up or get sucked in deep
[2:59:49] <Dr_Angelic> @PatStaresAt there's an option to speed up some of the little animations in the options menu, it makes the game go a lot faster but doesn't look as "stylish"
[2:59:50] <CappuccinoGuil> It's a potion. Instant use and consume it
[2:59:50] <%kknutson4> Wounds are no big deal
[2:59:50] <LoneFonte> @SSaryn i thought pat's game was lagging or something, i really forgot LUL
[2:59:51] <Louie_Salmon> Oh no, they're consumables
[2:59:52] <butthurtdave> plated armor wears off after combat, it's instant block added to you at the end of your turn/beginning of enemy turn
[2:59:54] <+pectusumbra> strong but a downside
[2:59:54] <%walternatorz> wounds are unplayable bad cards
[2:59:55] <%SirGO0SE> you can check the upgrades of a card now
[2:59:56] <$RealThiele> Armaments can be good
[2:59:57] <%SvenHolgersson> ARMAMENTS
[2:59:59] <reonome> ARMAMENTS PogChamp
[3:00:00] <%Visorak6> plated armor is block you get every turn, reduces in effectiveness as you get slapped
[3:00:02] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt apparently there is a xbox showcase with nier livestream tomorow for TGS in case you care.
[3:00:03] <0rond> I have 260 hours in this
[3:00:04] <whazat> upgraded armaments is great for new players
[3:00:05] <%Broand> potion, you can save for when you need it
[3:00:08] <+metalwolfchaos> for the love of god man
[3:00:08] <braincraft> It's hard to see doggo in the small picture, so it looks like Pat is jerking it.
[3:00:09] <0rond> armanents is a cool card
[3:00:11] <$RealThiele> Armaments upgraded
[3:00:11] <%crimsonharvest> smith another card?
[3:00:11] <Cosairen> damn that seems like some really good card selection
[3:00:12] <lloyddboy> UPGRADES
[3:00:12] <@SSaryn> @LoneFonte Yeah, it's a little jarring remembering what Fast Mode DOESN'T look like.
[3:00:13] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt its a potion, when consumed, gives you 4 Block every turn. -1 block every time you take damage. Last for the fight
[3:00:14] <%Bailey__gaming> it's a potion 1 use a time
[3:00:14] <+Rofiarf> fire
[3:00:16] <$RealThiele> upgrades your whole hand
[3:00:20] <%Dingalow> TIL Yanderedev is a Vtuber now
[3:00:21] <%Mendin> @PatStaresAt Remember that you -can- pass on adding a card to your deck, and eventually that'll be worthwhile
[3:00:22] <+Clundy> Add two uwus?
[3:00:24] <+deadmandro> My buddy told me to check it out last year, but I didn’t. I didn’t know it was on console
[3:00:27] <0rond> @PatStaresAt be sure to check the upgraded version of armanents
[3:00:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wounds are worthless cards that clog up your deck and make it harder to draw your good cards
[3:00:32] <braincraft> Honestly, usually the play is to just skip drafts.
[3:00:36] <+Rofiarf> minibosses and camps >>>>> normal fights
[3:00:44] <braincraft> Too many cards dilutes your deck.
[3:00:44] <%SirGO0SE> hes doing well enough to get an upgrade at the next campfire
[3:00:44] <cat5kable> @whazat Armaments+ feels so broken, its that good
[3:00:44] <+gumballwizard> @Dingalow are you for real LUL
[3:00:53] <@SSaryn> Couldn't have anyway, dw.
[3:00:53] <+pectusumbra> I personally like picking as many cards as I can
[3:00:56] <+metalwolfchaos> brok raise your hand if you read this
[3:00:57] <%Dingalow> Yes seriously
[3:00:59] <+metalwolfchaos> its thor
[3:01:01] <%Dingalow> I just checked
[3:01:03] <%Kinoskae> Don't forget your potions
[3:01:04] <%BubbaRands> LIVE N LEARN
[3:01:04] <SomeOtherNeb> it's a hard game anyway, don't beat yourself up if you lose
[3:01:04] <%Bailey__gaming> pommel strike is my fave ironclad card
[3:01:07] <Doofmaster> @ShinobiPhoenix until you get medkit dark embrace feel no painX2, then they're free shrugs Kappa
[3:01:10] <PartyWooper> for the most part its better to fight elites over upgrading cards. trinkets are very powerful.
[3:01:14] <$RealThiele> evolve MercyWing2 MercyWing1 please
[3:01:17] <%Garthunox> sonic adventure 2 stream when?
[3:01:19] <1matheuw> hangin on the edge of tomorrow
[3:01:22] <braincraft> I love tinydecking. Nothing like a three-card infinite.
[3:01:23] <%AzureGale> OPEN YOUR HEART, IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT
[3:01:24] <%Dingalow> He was coding a Vtuber avatar this whole time
[3:01:25] <%SirGO0SE> the fun thing about this game is there are op decks with 10 cards and op decks with 100 LUL
[3:01:31] <Tisaric> It took me a ton of time to get my first win but I don't know what the balance changes have been since then
[3:01:31] <%LucaOrue> LucaOrue subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[3:04:56] <%Bailey__gaming> BUY WIRLWIND

[3:09:50] <butthurtdave> armaments first

[3:09:50] <%AzureGale> ARMAMENTS
[3:09:50] <%Agami23> the arms!
[3:09:51] <$lotharrio> Armament!
[3:09:52] <+metalwolfchaos> IT IS THE GOD OF THUNDER ASKING FOR THE 100TH TIME WHERE IS THE HAMMER
[3:09:52] <%SirGO0SE> draw then armaments is a big play
[3:09:55] <$RealThiele> supa hot flame
[3:09:55] <%SirGO0SE> draw first
[3:09:57] <braincraft> Armaments Flame Barrier is the play, I think.
[3:09:57] <lloyddboy> sleeves
[3:10:03] <%AzureGale> YEYEYEYYE
[3:10:10] <%SirGO0SE> oh nvm
[3:10:14] <$RealThiele> TONK
[3:10:15] <+Astrobstrd> Flame Barrier is such a damn good card
[3:10:18] <%SirGO0SE> YEYEYE
[3:10:19] <reonome> lucky LUL
[3:10:22] <+TopTierHarley> yup
[3:10:24] <$RealThiele> Flame barrier vs hex
[3:10:25] <heartlesshealer> That shuffle draw LUL
[3:10:29] <+gumballwizard> nice
[3:10:29] <%Dingalow> @PatStaresAt That's some cute art for the overlay. Who made it?
[3:10:32] <Manwad> I love the joy in Pat's voice
[3:10:33] <Doofmaster> armed AF
[3:10:35] <+Rofiarf> i build i like with iron clad is get nothing but armour cards and body slam, and get rid of everything else
[3:10:36] <+skizzuto> skizzuto subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[3:10:36] <%Agami23> 309
[3:10:41] <+pectusumbra> Iron wave is always really solid
[3:10:42] <$RealThiele> Justinian Knight made the overlay
[3:10:47] <%SirGO0SE> block deck in general is good just feels hard to build when no body slam
[3:10:48] <kastev> Holy shit, Pat's playing Slay the Spire?
[3:10:54] <lloyddboy> BASH
[3:10:55] <%Bailey__gaming> wave and strike
[3:10:58] <kastev> That's a game I didn't think he'd ever play
[3:11:03] <%afronooch> @Rofiarf Block decks with Ironclad bring me so much joy
[3:11:08] <%SirGO0SE> why armor there?
[3:11:14] <LoneFonte> @kastev yep, first run
[3:11:18] <$RealThiele> Barricade 999 block is sexy
[3:11:21] <%Maloane> Maloane subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Keep on keeping on! Love from Alaska! ❤
[3:11:22] <lloyddboy> SLAP HE
[3:11:26] <+pectusumbra> means he's gonna swing for 32
[3:11:27] <Cosairen> oh i see so if you have like 10 cards you only have like 4 or so possible hands cause they all shuffle back in
[3:11:28] <%AzureGale> Shield bash is the best card of all cards
[3:11:31] <heartlesshealer> so mode changes interrupt actions
[3:11:31] <Cosairen> thats dope
[3:11:32] <+metalwolfchaos> BROK START TALKING TO SINDRI AND START WORKING ON THIS HAMMER
[3:11:35] <kastev> I've got 3k+ hours in this game, it's so fun
[3:11:36] <%SirGO0SE> @PatStaresAt you get your health back after this fight just a heads up
[3:11:37] <%Mendin> Mechanics
[3:11:44] <$RealThiele> hes doin it
[3:11:46] <Doofmaster> @SirGO0SE if you can make 999 block you can just kill everything with strikes so who needs body slam
[3:11:46] <braincraft> Shoulda done strike first, but it's his first time and he doesn't know the pattern.
[3:11:47] <%kknutson4> ez boss
[3:11:49] <%Bailey__gaming> @ssaryn is it OK to try to get him to read mode shift rebuff
[3:12:05] <Tisaric> @Cosairen you can very easily go infinite because of it, it's a fun time
[3:12:12] <%Agami23> odd choice pat butok
[3:12:21] <%SirGO0SE> @Doofmaster thats a really good point. and if you have just 1 you can easily dig for it when your blocks not dropping off EOT
[3:12:26] <butthurtdave> You're taking to this a lot better than I expected Pat, good job!
[3:12:29] <+pectusumbra> kill dat chtulu bot
[3:12:38] <%Spydurman> Pat's nailing this for a first run honesty=ly
[3:12:41] <braincraft> That flame barrier is actually doing a lot of work.
[3:12:45] <+metalwolfchaos> BROK WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR THIS HAMMER
[3:13:01] <heartlesshealer> Pat now understands mode change
[3:13:03] <%Bailey__gaming> flame barrier strong
[3:13:03] <%SirGO0SE> yeah hes picking it up fast, he'll start doing the optimal small things quick i bet @Spydurman
[3:13:08] <%kknutson4> kknutson4 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! I can't believe Pat is playing my favorite Roguelike Slay the Spire. Quick tip: You don't always have to add a card to your deck. You can skip adding a card in the Spoils screen.
[3:13:17] <%SirGO0SE> its almost like you can manipulate this boss
[3:13:18] <Tisaric> man I forgot how much this soundtrack has burned into my mind
[3:13:20] <%crimsonharvest> clap first for vuln

[3:13:59] <CappuccinoGuil> The thunderclap of those asscheeks Kreygasm
[3:14:01] <braincraft> Honestly, beating the first boss the first time you touch the game is not bad.
[3:14:05] <Sol_Install> baby why you fall
[3:14:11] <%AzureGale> At least it wasn't a baby
[3:14:13] <%saadi90> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp

[3:14:21] <$RealThiele> baby self drops
[3:14:26] <%chiazam> It's funny how passive he his right now
[3:14:30] <braincraft> It's fine, you get in trouble for dropping a baby but no one cares if it's a dog.
[3:14:30] <heartlesshealer> 5 x 3 = 15
[3:14:32] <Tisaric> yeah it took me like at least 20 runs to figure it out enough to beat the final boss
[3:14:34] <butthurtdave> You're healed to full after beating the Boss
[3:14:40] <%AzureGale> Take it to the face
[3:14:41] <Tisaric> if not way more

[3:16:06] <%saadi90> Good job!
[3:16:08] <%Visorak6> juggernaut
[3:16:10] <+deadmandro> Good stuff Pat
[3:16:12] <%crimsonharvest> it upgrades it
[3:16:13] <%Agami23> its a upgraded burnign blood
[3:16:16] <%SirGO0SE> CHOOSE WISELY
[3:16:16] <heartlesshealer> Better version of Burning Blood appear
[3:16:19] <butthurtdave> top one is best
[3:16:20] <gluemanofficial> No burning black blood?
[3:16:24] <rasamune> That's good
[3:16:25] <+Rofiarf> small decks are really good
[3:16:27] <%kknutson4> Ok so here you only pick one
[3:16:27] <butthurtdave> in case you get bad cards
[3:16:27] <lloyddboy> reasons
[3:16:27] <heartlesshealer> Empty Cage is for curses or power shuffling
[3:16:29] <whazat> to get rid of garbage strikes or defends
[3:16:29] <%crimsonharvest> You may at some point want to remove cards if youre trying to focus your build
[3:16:29] <%Kinoskae> For curses
[3:16:29] <%afronooch> Small decks strats
[3:16:29] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt sometimes a smaller deck is good
[3:16:30] <+Rofiarf> always get what you want
[3:16:30] <+PharosOfLight> thinner deck is more consistent
[3:16:30] <Tisaric> because your starting cards suck ass
[3:16:30] <$Fortunato5678> If you have negative cards
[3:16:31] <%skizzuto> smaller deck means you can draw your better cards faster
[3:16:31] <Doofmaster> so you draw good cards more instead of strikes
[3:16:31] <%DEETRz> gets rid of bad cards
[3:16:32] <+Ne1son> Burning blood is your starting relic
[3:16:32] <%Broand> So you have less cards
[3:16:32] <CrimsonFox777> Thin out your deck for consistency
[3:16:32] <1matheuw> to avoid you deck getting bloated
[3:16:32] <%Visorak6> deck bloat is bad
[3:16:32] <thesanderdc> You want to remove curses and useess
[3:16:33] <@SSaryn> Cause you don't want an influx of bad cards.
[3:16:34] <James_Quivers> Makes your deck more consistent
[3:16:34] <braincraft> Sometimes you want to streamline your deck so you get to the good cards sooner.
[3:16:34] <SomeOtherNeb> @PatStaresAt that way you can remove useless cards for free and get a better deck
[3:16:35] <+pectusumbra> it's removing bad cards from your deck to draw better
[3:16:35] <%SirGO0SE> because good players remove cards at every merchant LUL
[3:16:36] <%Laecerelius> You need to keep your deck thin enough to get the shit you want
[3:16:36] <%Spydurman> get rid of weak cards
[3:16:38] <Mr_Strut> Get rid of shitty cards
[3:16:38] <@SSaryn> Primarily Strike.
[3:16:39] <%Gogogolem> Small decks are more consistent.
[3:16:39] <rasamune> Smaller deck = draw best card faster
[3:16:39] <%Deft_Thought> Slimmer decks mean you get the cards you want faster
[3:16:40] <%chiazam> Small deck strat
[3:16:42] <%iamnolionheart> If you had cards you wanted to get rid of
[3:16:42] <%bevyrage> removing cards that don't synergize with your deck, and less cards means higher reliability
[3:16:42] <+DGenerator> Think of it like MtG
[3:16:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Small decks = get good shit more often
[3:16:43] <ha2ken> Remove bad cards
[3:16:44] <Twoiis> Consistency. Bloated decks hurt.
[3:16:44] <+Rofiarf> fair
[3:16:44] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Strikes and Defends are bad cards
[3:16:46] <%AzureGale> Look at him catching on
[3:16:46] <%Monkeyweed21> you remove the trash cards like defend
[3:16:48] <+pectusumbra> also curses are cards in this game
[3:16:48] <braincraft> The astrolabe is actually good.
[3:16:49] <+JavaManJoJo> @PatStaresAt small decks mean you cycle into your win conditions more often
[3:16:49] <%Gogogolem> You get doubl healing
[3:16:51] <whazat> time to keep going
[3:16:51] <LoneFonte> yeeeeeep
[3:16:52] <heartlesshealer> =)
[3:16:53] <+gumballwizard> heals more though
[3:16:53] <+YasQweenSLAY> Small deck strategy
[3:16:53] <%DappercatEsquire> no lol
[3:16:54] <%Ne1son> Sometimes your wanna be a thinn decked daddy
[3:16:54] <Mr_Strut> You thought!

[3:17:03] <%skizzuto> no there are three acts

[3:17:06] <+DGenerator> It's like MtG; you want to have a thin deck
[3:17:06] <$lotharrio> One floor of the tower, I guess.

[3:17:25] <%asgard147> You ain't at the spire yet Pat, jeez. limesGiggle
[3:17:27] <+agumon9000> It removes cards you don't want. One of the best decks in the game is literally 2 cards. Which is just a 0 cost buff and a 0 cost attack which deals damage and draws cards
[3:17:30] <Luizabd> You can't even get a real win yet

[3:17:56] <braincraft> Thorns fucks these guys.
[3:17:57] <%DappercatEsquire> these birds are assholes depending on your deck
[3:18:01] <braincraft> Also, whirlwind.
[3:18:07] <%Bailey__gaming> Squark Squark
[3:18:11] <VritraReiRei> Flame Barrier will do quick work of these guys!
[3:18:18] <+Rofiarf> this is where whirlwind is really good
[3:18:19] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> psaCaw < CAW CAW I'm a run killer CAW
[3:18:20] <anAngryHamster> Once you have a good synergy going you can just ignore new card drops. It'll just make your deck less effective.

[3:19:34] <%Bailey__gaming> Wirlwind
[3:19:34] <+The_Protagonist> psaBlep
[3:19:36] <+TopTierHarley> its ok he'll heal 12 after this
[3:19:39] <SomeOtherNeb> thunderclap those CHEEKS
[3:19:39] <+pectusumbra> will whirlwind kill?
[3:19:42] <heartlesshealer> whirlwind so good against birds
[3:19:52] <annearkie> bird is sad now :(
[3:19:58] <$RealThiele> his HP will become sex number
[3:19:59] <lloyddboy> @braincraft the second whirlwind gets 0 energy though
[3:20:10] <braincraft> Is that how it works now?
[3:20:11] <%linSP> nice
[3:20:16] <braincraft> It used to be a strict recast.
[3:20:16] <$lotharrio> Die bird, you don't belong in this world.
[3:20:25] <braincraft> Same energy and everything.
[3:20:27] <%Monkeyweed21> nice
[3:20:28] <%logoth_> Wow that guy has a stance like Suo from Valkyrie Profile
[3:20:29] <@SSaryn> 69 nice
[3:20:33] <TheHeroAppears> pat is gonna hate this guy
[3:20:35] <$RealThiele> plant!
[3:20:37] <+pectusumbra> that's the buff you got off your potion
[3:20:37] <SomeOtherNeb> it's a tough fight to learn
[3:20:39] <heartlesshealer> Plated Armor is what that one potion gave you during the boss
[3:20:40] <Doofmaster> @lloyddboy that's incorrect
[3:20:41] <+pectusumbra> you reduce it by dealing damage
[3:20:43] <%Broand> Whittle em down
[3:20:46] <%Visorak6> yeah this guy is a bitch
[3:20:54] <%AzureGale> Bird. Die now, and leave this world. You'll never belong here!
[3:20:57] <Doofmaster> fuck that avocado up
[3:20:58] <%skizzuto> gotta chip away at that armor
[3:20:59] <annearkie> oh you gotta hit this guy HARD
[3:21:00] <%Bailey__gaming> army
[3:21:01] <$RealThiele> if you can break his armor fully hes just a stunned potato
[3:21:03] <%Broand> Armaments fi- oh
[3:21:12] <%Visorak6> you gotta get ahead of this guy imo
[3:21:14] <braincraft> Anything less than his block may as well not happen.
[3:21:15] <heartlesshealer> every turn
[3:21:22] <whazat> you're gonna need to do at least 14 damage to start lowering his plated armor
[3:21:23] <+pectusumbra> yeah, you have to do 15 to start lowing
[3:21:28] <@SSaryn> Hit it good.
[3:21:28] <braincraft> It's a dps check.
[3:21:29] <heartlesshealer> every singular hit reduces it
[3:21:29] <lloyddboy> is it? I remember a second X card doing nothing and getting mad
[3:21:35] <%linSP> gotta hit the red to remove a plate
[3:21:35] <SomeOtherNeb> it's a super tough enemy
[3:21:38] <+pectusumbra> take your time
[3:21:49] <Doofmaster> NOT SUCH A FUN LITTLE CARD GAME NOW HUH
[3:21:50] <heartlesshealer> Pat is Frail
[3:21:54] <braincraft> Yeah, double tap that pommel.
[3:22:00] <heartlesshealer> puppy
[3:22:01] <braincraft> oh.
[3:22:01] <@SSaryn> Pat has always been frail Kappa
[3:22:05] <%Bailey__gaming> this dude is a pain
[3:22:08] <annearkie> he HEALS??
[3:22:09] <%Totally_Not_Toby> pat pls
[3:22:14] <braincraft> Yeah, he has a lifesteal on top of all that bullshit.
[3:22:14] <%chiazam> F
[3:22:15] <+agumon9000> Double tap sword boomerang
[3:22:16] <+agumon9000> GG
[3:22:17] <heartlesshealer> Juggernaut will help you here
[3:22:20] <+TopTierHarley> its ok @braincraft he'll learn
[3:22:22] <+pectusumbra> double tap into boomerang
[3:22:24] <%Laecerelius> The evil potato!
[3:22:25] <%skizzuto> double tap the boomerang?
[3:22:26] <%Visorak6> double boomerang
[3:22:29] <heartlesshealer> or that
[3:22:34] <annearkie> this enemy seems almost as hard than the last boss...
[3:22:36] <%AzureGale> rekt
[3:22:48] <+pectusumbra> and that's his weakness, multihits
[3:22:51] <%SirGO0SE> he thicc
[3:23:04] <%skizzuto> acts 2 and 3 are no joke
[3:23:04] <%Visorak6> thats how it goes, you should see elites lmao
[3:23:08] <annearkie> gonna get murked by...an old potato with arms?
[3:23:14] <%linSP> uh oh bruh

[3:23:30] <annearkie> cmooooooooon
[3:23:32] <heartlesshealer> rip
[3:23:33] <braincraft> Wow, razor thin margin there.
[3:23:34] <@SSaryn> Almost died without that stun waow
[3:23:37] <annearkie> eyyyyyy
[3:23:39] <%AzureGale> Clutch win!
[3:23:41] <%Totally_Not_Toby> zoinks scoob
[3:23:41] <+agumon9000> Act 2 is generally considered the hardest act. It really punishes weak decks that leave act 1
[3:23:42] <LoneFonte> wait, why was it stunned?
[3:23:43] <thesanderdc> Throwing aay the run for not defending
[3:23:43] <whazat> thankfully you have blackblood to get some hp back
[3:23:45] <heartlesshealer> LANTERN IS HERE
[3:23:47] <lloyddboy> huh, didn't know he'd get stunned
[3:23:47] <TheHeroAppears> well it was a good run pat
[3:23:49] <Doofmaster> no waffle :'(
[3:23:53] <+pectusumbra> carelessness will find no clemency in this place
[3:23:55] <lloyddboy> LANTERN
[3:23:58] <rasamune> Ooh nice
[3:23:59] <OperatorJo_> NotLikeThis clutched
[3:24:00] <%Visorak6> lantern would be nice
[3:24:01] <TheFakeBob> breaking the plate mail stuns it
[3:24:03] <SomeOtherNeb> Lantern's real good
[3:24:04] <Doofmaster> @LoneFonte he gets stunned if you strip his plated, I forgot about it
[3:24:07] <$spardanwarrior> Only for turn 1, but it's still great
[3:24:09] <%kknutson4> Extra energy is only the first turn
[3:24:12] <+pectusumbra> yeah its worth saving your money for relics
[3:24:13] <lloyddboy> NICE
[3:24:13] <%Broand> Each combat, not turn iirc
[3:24:14] <+agumon9000> PogChamp
[3:24:14] <LoneFonte> ooooooooh, got it
[3:24:14] <@SSaryn> Rule of thumb, genuinely wanna be getting rid of Strikes btw. But yeah Lantern is pretty good.
[3:24:14] <whazat> any and all energy relics are god-tier
[3:24:16] <heartlesshealer> These guys! <3
[3:24:17] <%skizzuto> it's plus 1 energy but only on your first turn
[3:24:18] <rasamune> Dogby!
[3:24:19] <SomeOtherNeb> he PET
[3:24:19] <%Bailey__gaming> lantern op
[3:24:20] <heartlesshealer> Pat might get heals!
[3:24:22] <+Lazy_Vagabond> only turn 1 but still really good
[3:24:23] <braincraft> The rarer the card, the better the healing.
[3:24:23] <+agumon9000> Give up double tap
[3:24:23] <%logoth_> He's pawing your face saying nuuuu
[3:24:27] <+The_Protagonist> OH he's gettin to be a big boi
[3:24:27] <$RealThiele> spirit poop!
[3:24:30] <%bevyrage> The merchant asked if you were a dog person or a cat person. If you weren't a Pat person, what would you be?
[3:24:34] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Give them a rare for a full heal
[3:24:36] <+agumon9000> Give up double tap or Jugg
[3:24:37] <annearkie> is your energy per turn always 3?
[3:24:40] <heartlesshealer> chuck something in
[3:24:40] <+pectusumbra> give a good thing to live
[3:24:41] <+Rofiarf> reward is based on rarity

[3:30:27] <MoonlightWolves> While looks simple, surprizingly challenging
[3:30:39] <whazat> he just tosses those in your deck to annoy you
[3:30:40] <LoneFonte> let him pull a full hand of hex LUL
[3:30:40] <bashful_bard> Why are the hit effects so aggressive? Never seen them look like that
[3:30:40] <heartlesshealer> sorry
[3:30:41] <swirlyeye> filling your deck with poop
[3:30:44] <+pectusumbra> every time you do a not attack he gives you a daze
[3:30:46] <+agumon9000> One off
[3:30:46] <Doofmaster> it's hex, the debuff he gave you
[3:30:48] <%Visorak6> hes filling your deck with junk
[3:30:49] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt not turning cards unplayable, he's ADDING them to your draw pile
[3:30:53] <lloyddboy> LETHAL
[3:30:58] <lloyddboy> PAT
[3:30:59] <%DappercatEsquire> has Pat been pretty lucky this run?
[3:30:59] <@SSaryn> Off by one bois
[3:31:00] <+pectusumbra> 1 off yeah
[3:31:03] <$spardanwarrior> 1 off lethal
[3:31:08] <LoneFonte> not lethal
[3:31:10] <rasamune> It happens
[3:31:14] <lloyddboy> ah shit maths
[3:31:24] <Lophostrix_> never ever lucky
[3:31:24] <+KeslGames> Holy crap your deck is way too big
[3:31:30] <%DappercatEsquire> the fattest deck
[3:31:32] <PatchySouls> double upgraded Armaments? sounds good to me
[3:31:34] <lloyddboy> sleep is for the weak
[3:31:36] <heartlesshealer> bird gang
[3:31:36] <+TopTierHarley> who cares
[3:31:37] <@SSaryn> CAW CAW
[3:31:39] <+ghostfaceninja_> @ghostfaceninja_ I played the game for a lil while and could never win with watcher, tried various builds but I get fucked over by rng on the last boss every time
[3:31:39] <+TopTierHarley> let him play
[3:31:39] <lloyddboy> double so in this game
[3:31:39] <+pectusumbra> note you do want to smith as much as you can to keep getting stronger
[3:31:42] <%kknutson4> ? rooms are good on these floors
[3:31:43] <%linSP> cleve first
[3:31:44] <%Broand> HITTEM WITH A WHIRLWIND
[3:31:44] <Mr_Strut> Well thats a good start
[3:31:46] <%Ne1son> Cleave first
[3:31:46] <reonome> its his first run its normal
[3:31:46] <dapperskeleton69> deck more like decc
[3:31:48] <LoneFonte> yeeeep
[3:31:48] <$RealThiele> Searing Blow +21 LUL
[3:31:48] <%Visorak6> KILL EM ALL
[3:31:48] <%afronooch> CAW CAW
[3:31:49] <+TopTierHarley> yes
[3:31:52] <alephalpha> CLEAVE THEN SPIN
[3:31:56] <+TopTierHarley> X means energey
[3:31:57] <%Visorak6> cleave first
[3:32:01] <%kknutson4> Spin 2 Win
[3:32:02] <%AzureGale> KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM
[3:32:02] <%BubbaRands> 11 vs 15...
[3:32:04] <Doofmaster> 35 cards is pretty standard, the problem here is they're bad cards with few relics
[3:32:05] <+AtlasMcCoy> CACAW
[3:32:06] <Fdrank> CAW CAW
[3:32:07] <+agumon9000> CAW CAW
[3:32:08] <@SSaryn> CAW CAW
[3:32:08] <$RealThiele> big damage
[3:32:10] <+pectusumbra> cleave is better, but you can do things like buff your damage then go off
[3:32:13] <rasamune> Split them wide open
[3:32:15] <+ghostfaceninja_> but watcher is super fun
[3:32:17] <lloyddboy> CAW VAW
[3:32:18] <Lophostrix_> CAW A FUCKING CAW
[3:32:19] <lloyddboy> SHIT
[3:32:22] <+JavaManJoJo> you cowards have never seen a thicc deck if you think 26 is too much (ps I'm just teasing)
[3:32:23] <%DappercatEsquire> these guys look like they like to party
[3:32:26] <%Bailey__gaming> spin to win
[3:32:28] <%Shardlab> I'm losing my mind. I'm so wired to mechanically play certain stuff and I know Pat ain't
[3:32:31] <$RealThiele> chip damage in this game WILL kill you so 11 v 14 dmg dealt is important
[3:32:31] <Louie_Salmon> @doofmaster And also he's like halfway into act 2
[3:32:42] <+KeslGames> PAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A CARD EVERY TIME
[3:32:44] <heartlesshealer> ooh
[3:32:55] <%Visorak6> double cleave baby
[3:33:01] <%BubbaRands> 1
[3:33:03] <+TopTierHarley> he knows Kesl
[3:33:04] <Kief_Meister> NO KEEP TAKING CARDS YOU FUCK
[3:33:08] <+TopTierHarley> just let him play
[3:33:09] <Kief_Meister> TAKE ALL THE CARDS
[3:33:11] <$spardanwarrior> Deck bloat makes it harder to find the cards you need
[3:33:12] <%DappercatEsquire> less predictability in your deck will fuck you hard
[3:33:12] <braincraft> Pat's like one Girya away from a pretty strong run.
[3:33:15] <%BubbaRands> CAW
[3:33:17] <fierysnowflakes> CAWW
[3:33:17] <bashful_bard> Yeah if you're running sub 30 card decks consistently you're probably losing a lot
[3:33:17] <whazat> good to take cards especially when you want to learn how new cards work
[3:33:20] <+pectusumbra> it's fine, I take every card I can
[3:33:21] <%Broand> BARRICADE
[3:33:23] <annearkie> caww :(
[3:33:24] <%Agami23> barricade is god tier
[3:33:25] <$RealThiele> flex would also beef this run
[3:33:25] <1matheuw> ca
[3:33:27] <heartlesshealer> cards are fun
[3:33:27] <1matheuw> w
[3:33:29] <$spardanwarrior> YO
[3:33:30] <lloyddboy> NICE
[3:33:31] <$RealThiele> BARRICXADE
[3:33:31] <+agumon9000> PogChamp
[3:33:33] <%Ne1son> yeyeye
[3:33:33] <Cosairen> fuck it we playing 200 card decks in standard
[3:33:34] <+KeslGames> Sorry I'm getting triggered by that deck size
[3:33:35] <@SSaryn> Wouldn't call Barricade god tier but ok
[3:33:37] <%Broand> oh shit sudden sick combo
[3:33:38] <+agumon9000> Rematch
[3:33:38] <%afronooch> Barricade Kreygasm
[3:33:39] <%Visorak6> barricade is a build card
[3:33:40] <+klooswep> The goal of this game is to take every single card so that the final boss has no cards left to play against you Kappa
[3:33:41] <Mr_Strut> Round 2
[3:33:43] <$RealThiele> holy shit
[3:33:44] <1matheuw> oh shit its yaboy
[3:33:44] <Lophostrix_> SNEK
[3:33:44] <heartlesshealer> hi sneko
[3:33:45] <Lophostrix_> O
[3:33:46] <LoneFonte> AGAIN?
[3:33:47] <+DGenerator> Think of decks like colors. Strength builds are red decks; it's best to stick to select red cards.
[3:33:50] <lloyddboy> Kappa
[3:33:53] <VritraReiRei> Enemy over Campsite?
[3:33:55] <Doofmaster> unless that card is Searing Blow
[3:33:57] <+KeslGames> Oh bot this is bad
[3:34:00] <anAngryHamster> Powers only need to be played once
[3:34:01] <pillygram> ironclad has a card you can upgrade infinitely though
[3:34:05] <pillygram> yeah Searing Blow
[3:34:08] <$RealThiele> i wish there were more cards liek searing blow
[3:34:11] <@SSaryn> @VritraReiRei He either didn't see it or actually wanted to take it.
[3:34:14] <%za7az> @SSaryn it's literally the best card in the game
[3:34:15] <Klarrann3> cards can only be upgraded once unless specified otherwise
[3:34:26] <$lotharrio> Man these snek sure like making Pat stronger.
[3:34:34] <@SSaryn> @za7az Barricade? Hardly, and I wouldn't call any card in this game the best card in the game.
[3:34:46] <+ghostfaceninja_> barricade is god tier
[3:34:53] <+TopTierHarley> SSaryn...
[3:34:54] <braincraft> Naw, just race him down.
[3:34:57] <Doofmaster> @SSaryn not even shiv+?
[3:34:57] <$RealThiele> 1 cost jesus
[3:34:58] <%DappercatEsquire> you gotta build around barricade
[3:35:03] <bashful_bard> This game doesn't have a best card
[3:35:07] <@SSaryn> @Doofmaster Now you're speaking my language Kappa
[3:35:10] <braincraft> You're never going to have enough defense to save in this fight.
[3:35:12] <$RealThiele> Barricade loves body slam
[3:35:12] <+gumballwizard> Ritual dagger can be upgraded multiple times
[3:35:15] <Vermillion129> He did saw a bonfire and took enemy wave instead, he will learn the important of bonfire eventually if he kept playing the game
[3:35:20] <+metalwolfchaos> brok is god tier foreal
[3:35:21] <%za7az> @SSaryn Clearly you've never done a run built around it plus body slam lol
[3:35:29] <%kknutson4> Wraith form is best card
[3:35:36] <1matheuw> oraroa
[3:35:37] <lloyddboy> ORA ORA ORA
[3:35:41] <heartlesshealer> he went for the jojo card
[3:35:42] <@SSaryn> @za7az No, I clearly have and it's still something you need to build for and genuinely can't get all the time.
[3:35:45] <+KeslGames> oh god he's dead
[3:35:45] <%Visorak6> super clutch potion
[3:35:50] <$RealThiele> RIP
[3:35:50] <%uncle_grumps> Git 'em!
[3:35:53] <DonatelloJose> Building a good storm deck in this game feels soooo good.
[3:35:53] <%linSP> this fight sucks
[3:35:54] <%kknutson4> I suggest killing back guy first
[3:35:55] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Oh boy and it's THIS elite
[3:35:58] <+ghostfaceninja_> omg I just realized how he's playing DansGame
[3:36:00] <+gumballwizard> Oh no
[3:36:01] <whazat> this elite is super rough
[3:36:04] <+AtlasMcCoy> F
[3:36:18] <+KeslGames> hit the back one
[3:36:19] <%Arweynn> Act 2 elites are just aweful
[3:36:20] <pillygram> oh this this encounter jadeth2AAA
[3:36:23] <bashful_bard> Kinda hard to make barricade work without corruption and or entrench
[3:36:28] <braincraft> You usually want to play draw first, in case it changes your options.
[3:36:32] <Tisaric> there's definitely objectively good/best combos but not single cards
[3:36:34] <%za7az> @SSaryn Eh, agree to disagree
[3:36:37] <lloyddboy> phew
[3:36:42] <%Arweynn> I think Snecko is the least bad one
[3:36:43] <pillygram> nvm pat's a god
[3:36:45] <$RealThiele> the next debuff LUL
[3:36:48] <$RealThiele> he lucky
[3:36:48] <pillygram> tarotxCHEER tarotxCHEER tarotxCHEER
[3:37:01] <LoneFonte> @DonatelloJose playing defect in general feels great to see a lot of thing going of after a couple of turns
[3:37:05] <+metalwolfchaos> broken game just use god of thunder to win
[3:37:09] <+metalwolfchaos> thunder clap
[3:37:23] <Tisaric> Defect is super fun
[3:37:26] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[3:37:27] <%za7az> You're right that on it's own it's not particularly special
[3:37:28] <Doofmaster> I think the best thing about Slay the Spire is that best is very contextual based on deck so far, relics, how far you are in the run, what fights are coming up...
[3:37:43] <$RealThiele> LUL 1 x4
[3:37:51] <bashful_bard> I don't believe you
[3:37:52] <DonatelloJose> @LoneFonte Can not disagree with that. it's a fun play style.
[3:37:56] <%kknutson4> Don't forget about that 2nd potion
[3:38:03] <%logoth_> that card is doing the JUST HOOK IT TO MY VEINS pose
[3:38:07] <+BubbaChancho> BubbaChancho subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:38:18] <%za7az> I argue that it's the best because of how easy it is to set up + only needs to be activated once
[3:38:23] <%DappercatEsquire> good job reading pat
[3:38:27] <+agumon9000> OMEGA RNG
[3:38:28] <bashful_bard> It's a free 3 cost

[3:38:35] <%Grayhammatter> by the skin of your teeth

[3:38:36] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Reading is hard
[3:38:39] <+agumon9000> LUL
[3:38:39] <+AtlasMcCoy> OH NO
[3:38:41] <Lophostrix_> IDIOT
[3:38:42] <@SSaryn> Yeah, things genuinely just are, what do you really need for any upcoming fights, or what can you build into basically.
[3:38:44] <%Grayhammatter> PAT
[3:38:44] <londorpaleale> LUL
[3:38:45] <$RealThiele> LUL
[3:38:45] <heartlesshealer> OH NO

[3:38:49] <%Laecerelius> Well he survived
[3:38:49] <%Neryl_> LUL
[3:38:54] <Vermillion129> Bakapat
[3:38:54] <rasamune> Well he's still alive
[3:38:54] <%chiazam> AHO
[3:38:57] <%AzureGale> This is going SWELL
[3:39:00] <bashful_bard> Happens to everyone
[3:39:01] <%DappercatEsquire> jesus this deck
[3:39:02] <Doofmaster> oh nooooooo Kappa
[3:39:03] <braincraft> Impervious + Barricade is actually not bad.
[3:39:07] <%Agami23> so the elite enemies always drop a trinket
[3:39:07] <LoneFonte> LUL oh pat
[3:39:08] <%za7az> Yup
[3:39:11] <%Grayhammatter> oh no
[3:39:11] <+AtlasMcCoy> NotLikeThis
[3:39:11] <heartlesshealer> puppy face <3
[3:39:13] <@SSaryn> Skipped Impervious oh no
[3:39:13] <%Neryl_> ????????????/
[3:39:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> Gief is tiwed
[3:39:15] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> WutFace
[3:39:16] <%afronooch> oh noooo
[3:39:16] <heartlesshealer> OH GOD THE PLANT
[3:39:18] <%Ne1son> Thicc Deck Daddy
[3:39:19] <$RealThiele> yea
[3:39:20] <heartlesshealer> NotLikeThis
[3:39:23] <$RealThiele> chompy boi
[3:39:24] <%Laecerelius> Do BIG DAMAGE
[3:39:26] <EdictEngine> Death comes
[3:39:29] <$spardanwarrior> Hate this plant
[3:39:32] <@SSaryn> Oh boi good thing he didn't pick up that Impervious huh guys Kappa
[3:39:35] <Lophostrix_> what a sweet sweet boy
[3:39:39] <braincraft> Gotta remember you have extra energy on turn 1.
[3:39:40] <%DappercatEsquire> is that a relic that lets you make a pretty neat Anger mill deck?
[3:39:41] <+TopTierHarley> wasting energy again
[3:39:43] <$RealThiele> Winds Howling.
[3:39:46] <bashful_bard> Idk if you can afford to skip that impervious
[3:39:47] <Doofmaster> 0 energy cost is NOT free because card draw is an important resource
[3:39:56] <%Agami23> doubletap ander is so good
[3:39:57] <IceCreamAndAHug> Misplay LUL
[3:39:57] <GreyFoxHoundDD> If you build for Anger, you can just infinitely loop some enemies to death with it if you get the Unceasing Top
[3:39:59] <+ghostfaceninja_> potions Pat
[3:40:08] <braincraft> 0 cost plus draw is actually free, though.
[3:40:12] <@SSaryn> Anger can be good for sure but yeah, looking at things like free damage is something that is probably.. not a good idea.
[3:40:15] <heartlesshealer> So your blue potion =p
[3:40:16] <Doofmaster> pls no snake plant
[3:40:18] <$lotharrio> You're full on potions.
[3:40:27] <braincraft> Basically. There are specific situations in which you might not want to draw.
[3:40:28] <$RealThiele> i dont htink ive ever had a run with anger work out
[3:40:37] <%Visorak6> bad hand for this turn
[3:40:40] <heartlesshealer> save baby
[3:40:43] <braincraft> Yeah, this is what kills the run.
[3:40:47] <+GrandmasterBFunk> BABY
[3:40:47] <lloyddboy> THE CHILDE
[3:40:49] <%afronooch> I always combine anger and strength decks
[3:40:54] <@SSaryn> Well Pat's probably dead next turn. Also THE CHILD
[3:40:54] <%mike2hands> get baby to his bed
[3:40:57] <+TopTierHarley> if only you had a +2 strength potion
[3:40:57] <braincraft> He did real good for literally the first time touching the thing.
[3:40:59] <%za7az> Aww <3
[3:40:59] <$spardanwarrior> I see lethal
[3:41:01] <heartlesshealer> is him sleep time soon?
[3:41:03] <James_Quivers> Anger is busted when you have shuriken and kunai and shit

[3:43:05] <LoneFonte> I finally thought i was done with StS for a while, and then i discover the Downfall mod...
[3:43:12] <fatcrab> damn what's this song it's familiar
[3:43:14] <+metalwolfchaos> great game right here loving it
[3:43:31] <Darkfire346> just got done with an hour session on my new Rift S. Nobody told me how exhausting VR can be
[3:43:41] <fatcrab> !song
[3:43:45] <fatcrab> is it from a game
[3:44:01] <%TamsynRRD> I thinks he’s doing pretty good for his first run ever
[3:44:01] <%Typhaeon> I lost my VR equipment with everything else I owned in a fire, but it's incredibly helpful if you're going from sedentary to active
[3:44:35] <+ghostfaceninja_> so the question now is, does Pat go silent or defect next?
[3:44:39] <Darkfire346> I spent an hour in Blade and Sorcery and Creed Rise to Glory and my hair is matted to my head from sweat
[3:45:13] <leinadtonu> The be right back music sounds a little creepy with all those distortions...
[3:45:16] <LoneFonte> you can only get defect from a silent run, i think
[3:45:24] <Doofmaster> @ghostfaceninja_ need to play a run with silent unlocked to unlock defect
[3:45:25] <+TopTierHarley> ^
[3:45:31] <@SoFarFetched> @fatcrab Boot Loop - F1NG3RS
[3:45:35] <+metalwolfchaos> sounds like blasphemy

[3:46:16] <Doofmaster> @AoiRob we have like 20 mediocre attack cards and are going to die
[3:46:22] <LoneFonte> will we get to see Pat do a Watcher run today?
[3:46:33] <+TopTierHarley> no
[3:46:42] <DashXero> I just got here. How did Pat like Going Under?
[3:46:53] <@SoFarFetched> It was too real for him and the rest of us LUL
[3:46:56] <%Order_of_Mystery> does anyone happen to have the clip from Rediculousness that Pat and Paige were featured in?
[3:46:57] <%Typhaeon> I had Newegg on autorefresh and it went immediately from prerelease to sold out
[3:47:04] <+ghostfaceninja_> most likely Pat will never even know about watcher
[3:47:20] <DashXero> Oh wow. I'm gonna need to look at the VODs.
[3:47:59] <@SoFarFetched> Dev's were even in chat watching him play it

[3:51:11] <%Spydurman> ded
[3:51:12] <heartlesshealer> Use this nothing battle to learn
[3:51:16] <@SSaryn> Nah he can still genuinely do this fight.
[3:51:22] <@SoFarFetched> Why does that enemy look like a tired paige wrapped in a huge blanket
[3:51:33] <@SSaryn> @SoFarFetched Yes.
[3:51:38] <Giztech> dam and were just getting the angriest Pat going
[3:51:46] <braincraft> That's basically what she is.
[3:51:48] <heartlesshealer> group healing enemy
[3:51:52] <%AzureGale> NEVER GIVE UP NEVER SURRENDER
[3:51:53] <$lotharrio> One last potion!
[3:51:56] <whazat> that's okay, one run is but the beginning of a rogue like
[3:51:59] <VritraReiRei> what the last potion Pat has?
[3:52:02] <Cosairen> angriest pat wouldnt have died here
[3:52:02] <%Grayhammatter> that is paige for sure
[3:52:13] <%Agami23> you did real good for a first run
[3:52:16] <+TopTierHarley> not killing the healer? couldnt be me
[3:52:17] <Doofmaster> @VritraReiRei elixir: exhaust any number of cards in your hand
[3:52:17] <Kain5707> scum save!
[3:52:19] <%Agami23> and you'll get a interesting reward
[3:52:24] <%za7az> You did well
[3:52:25] <%AzureGale> A damn fine first run
[3:52:28] <%Spydurman> pretty strong first run
[3:52:35] <lloyddboy> yeah
[3:52:36] <braincraft> He got beat to death by a white mage.
[3:52:39] <+The_Protagonist> Jank
[3:52:39] <heartlesshealer> It's very particular
[3:52:40] <%Laecerelius> derpy?
[3:52:40] <+ghostfaceninja_> LUL yeah
[3:52:41] <%DappercatEsquire> considering you don't have the advantage of knowing what enemies do, that was a great first run
[3:52:42] <heartlesshealer> NEW CHARACTER
[3:52:44] <+RenoDeGeneric> It's simple
[3:52:45] <%BoxNavy> yeah FeelsBadMan
[3:52:46] <+metalwolfchaos> great run brok
[3:52:46] <reonome> the silent PogChamp
[3:52:47] <count_bob> IT is a little.
[3:52:51] <whazat> it definitely looks like a flash game
[3:52:53] <%AzureGale> Yeah, the art is very flash game-esque
[3:52:54] <%Agami23> each character has completely different cards.
[3:52:57] <SomeAsianDood> shiv girl Pog
[3:52:59] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I think this is one of those,they focused more on gameplay rather than the art
[3:52:59] <%thebeargoesHONK> poison
[3:53:01] <heartlesshealer> Entirely different playstyles with each character
[3:53:02] <Lophostrix_> SHIV RUN
[3:53:03] <braincraft> I actually like the variation in play not only between characters, but between builds.
[3:53:04] <Doublemint_Dave_> These select screens ar rad tho
[3:53:06] <lloyddboy> GRANDMA SWAMP
[3:53:07] <+AtlasMcCoy> dedicated

[3:53:27] <+TopTierHarley> check map
[3:53:29] <julrave> top one
[3:53:29] <%walternatorz> you can view the map up at the top right
[3:53:29] <CrimsonFox777> Praise Neow!
[3:53:31] <+gumballwizard> She’s dedicated
[3:53:32] <%thebeargoesHONK> you can check map
[3:53:33] <Doofmaster> you can check the map before you pick if you want
[3:53:33] <%Broand> How lucky do you feel
[3:53:33] <%afronooch> check map
[3:53:34] <%Aeoneth> It Whale
[3:53:35] <Cosairen> is silent like a black deck
[3:53:35] <%Visorak6> 1 and hunt for elite fights early
[3:53:36] <%Grayhammatter> check map
[3:53:36] <+metalwolfchaos> talk to the whale brok
[3:53:38] <Lophostrix_> WHALE IS FRIEND ALL IS GOOD
[3:53:39] <%kknutson4> LB
[3:53:39] <%DappercatEsquire> gotta restart until you can get to an elite in the first 3, pro scum strat
[3:53:39] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt you can cheese an elite with the top option
[3:53:43] <+ghostfaceninja_> this characters all about draws discards and combos
[3:53:44] <heartlesshealer> Select/Back button
[3:53:52] <LoneFonte> select
[3:53:52] <+AtlasMcCoy> The upper right hand corner shows the button
[3:54:05] <CappuccinoGuil> This character is fun AF
[3:54:09] <%DappercatEsquire> that's a hard maybe
[3:54:11] <CrimsonFox777> If you get lucky, you can get one.
[3:54:13] <%Broand> there is
[3:54:15] <%kknutson4> It's possible but unlikely
[3:54:16] <%Visorak6> no early elites
[3:54:18] <%Agami23> you can earn money for shop on one path
[3:54:20] <heartlesshealer> it's still always a good pick if you don't like the other choice
[3:54:22] <Doofmaster> there's one path with a tiny chance of a snipe
[3:54:22] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt there is but you have A LOT of Question Marks
[3:54:23] <%DappercatEsquire> 3 COMBAT encounters, if you're lucky none of those ? will be
[3:54:24] <SomeAsianDood> you could luck out and get a bunch of questionmarks to face an elite at 1
[3:54:27] <0rond> possible but highly unlikely
[3:54:34] <+metalwolfchaos> the whale was actually thor asking for Mjolnir
[3:54:38] <%Visorak6> yes
[3:54:40] <%Broand> you just have to avoid the monster fights and pray to not fight in question marks
[3:54:42] <aeonicvector> middle of rights for randoms yeah
[3:54:48] <Cosairen> not this shit again
[3:54:54] <Doofmaster> ?s CAN be fights
[3:54:58] <Louie_Salmon> It's still good anyway, 3 free fights
[3:55:05] <lloyddboy> FART GAS
[3:55:06] <+metalwolfchaos> god damn this ChefFrank
[3:55:08] <$Fortunato5678> Poison
[3:55:08] <aeonicvector> 3
[3:55:09] <+PharosOfLight> poisooon
[3:55:09] <Lophostrix_> poison
[3:55:10] <whazat> poison
[3:55:11] <%afronooch> P O I S O N
[3:55:11] <bashful_bard> Yep
[3:55:16] <%DappercatEsquire> poison is strong, but it's best to go all in
[3:55:17] <$spardanwarrior> Poison stacks like crazy
[3:55:21] <%Visorak6> p o i s o n
[3:55:21] <%thebeargoesHONK> poison does damage at end of turn but ticks down one per turn
[3:55:21] <%Grayhammatter> fart gas PogChamp
[3:55:21] <%bevyrage> poison is legit
[3:55:23] <+agumon9000> Poison and Shivs are the way to go
[3:55:25] <%Agami23> you can make some fucked up poison builds
[3:55:25] <aeonicvector> if your not used to draw decks, use poison
[3:55:25] <$lotharrio> Stack them DoTs.
[3:55:26] <%Laecerelius> Poison can be very stronk
[3:55:28] <%thebeargoesHONK> RELIC
[3:55:30] <lloyddboy> DO NUT
[3:55:34] <VritraReiRei> Box or no Balls
[3:55:34] <+ghostfaceninja_> poison on first pack PogChamp
[3:55:38] <heartlesshealer> fuck regret
[3:55:41] <%Spydurman> DONUT
[3:55:42] <sectorquack> i try to force a shiv build every time
[3:55:42] <%Calek> they're quite cackling
[3:55:43] <%afronooch> Box or no balls
[3:55:43] <+agumon9000> NO
[3:55:44] <%Visorak6> 2 or 3 for balls
[3:55:45] <%DappercatEsquire> WHAT'S IN THE BOOOOOOX
[3:55:45] <CrimsonFox777> But free relic though....
[3:55:46] <aeonicvector> its a RELIC
[3:55:46] <%Ne1son> but a relic
[3:55:47] <+agumon9000> ALWAYS GO BOX
[3:55:47] <%bevyrage> you get a relic though
[3:55:47] <Lophostrix_> FREE RELIC
[3:55:49] <@SSaryn> Can be good, probably not good right njow obviously.
[3:55:49] <+It_sjustjoey> Donut
[3:55:50] <%kknutson4> But the Relic could be good
[3:55:50] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt you can remove curses.
[3:55:51] <%Broand> is this a cromartie reference
[3:55:52] <Doofmaster> to be fair relics are pretty good, but regret is a very bad curse
[3:55:53] <%AzureGale> Eat da donut
[3:55:54] <%afronooch> no balls
[3:55:57] <%kknutson4> It could even be a boat
[3:55:57] <%Valdorick> THE RELIC IS BAD
[3:56:00] <VritraReiRei> I KNEW IT
[3:56:01] <bashful_bard> ?'s get more and more likely to be hallway fights for each event you get that isn't a hallway fight
[3:56:01] <+It_sjustjoey> Yay
[3:56:02] <CrimsonFox777> YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN RID OF REGRET
[3:56:05] <heartlesshealer> Regret is NOT WORTH IT with this character
[3:56:05] <%afronooch> woooooooow
[3:56:06] <%Spydurman> Poison run is strong
[3:56:10] <aeonicvector> change
[3:56:11] <VritraReiRei> there is almost always a Remove Event after the Box lol
[3:56:13] <%Agami23> transform might be good
[3:56:15] <0rond> the curses are cards, they are only effective in your hand and are discarded at the end of the turn
[3:56:17] <%Visorak6> transform
[3:56:17] <%thebeargoesHONK> you can remove curses at rooms like that
[3:56:19] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:56:20] <$lotharrio> Upgrade that poison.
[3:56:26] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that's good
[3:56:28] <%kknutson4> You can pay the store to remove a curse
[3:56:28] <$Fortunato5678> Solid choice
[3:56:31] <@SSaryn> More like upgrade that strike Kappa
[3:56:33] <whazat> neutralize is also worth upgrading because 2 weak is actually so strong
[3:56:43] <%darthfodder> Neutralize would have been good too
[3:56:50] <Doofmaster> the extra cards are from Ring of the Snake
[3:56:50] <$spardanwarrior> All suck
[3:56:52] <+ghostfaceninja_> other baby FeelsGoodMan

[3:57:08] <%DappercatEsquire> i have never seen the card text clip the border like that, that's weird
[3:57:08] <Louie_Salmon> Dagger throw is fine, could pass
[3:57:10] <%darthfodder> either other
[3:57:11] <aeonicvector> throw
[3:57:13] <Mr_Strut> Combo with prepared
[3:57:14] <Sonicdy> Slay the ResidentSleeper

[3:59:26] <%Broand> Poison stab a ddue
[3:59:26] <whazat> bad fight for this character
[3:59:27] <+AtlasMcCoy> Its the STRONGEST face
[3:59:30] <%darthfodder> you can kill the 9 with poison
[3:59:31] <braincraft> Upgraded rain of daggers just solves this fight.
[3:59:33] <Louie_Salmon> This is a won run now
[3:59:37] <whazat> poison stab the 9 hp
[3:59:45] <%Visorak6> ^
[3:59:49] <aeonicvector> poison knife 2nd target
[3:59:50] <%bevyrage> kill and you don't need to block
[3:59:54] <lloyddboy> yup
[3:59:59] <SomeAsianDood> yes
[4:00:00] <heartlesshealer> Green health is poison damage
[4:00:01] <Doofmaster> NANI?
[4:00:01] <+RiceeFTW> yes they tick before their turn
[4:00:01] <%Grayhammatter> they will die
[4:00:03] <$spardanwarrior> Poison deals damage before they attack
[4:00:04] <aeonicvector> green is their poisoned hp
[4:00:04] <%kknutson4> Poison will kill it b4 it attacks
[4:00:05] <whazat> poison procs before enemies do anything
[4:00:05] <%Visorak6> yes
[4:00:41] <lloyddboy> PERFECT
[4:00:42] <+The_H1R0> If the card does not make sense, chances are it is useless in 95% of situations. You also though are 100% likely to run into that 5% of situations when you pass on it. In short, this game is a dick sometimes.
[4:00:44] <%Visorak6> 7 then 6
[4:00:48] <%SirGO0SE> i luv dots
[4:00:52] <%afronooch> good order
[4:00:59] <aeonicvector> poison is great cause it can be EXTRA damage, OR DoT, based on your needs
[4:01:00] <+PharosOfLight> also you dont need to discard if your hand is empty
[4:01:02] <+ghostfaceninja_> he should def pick up some block cards in the next few packs
[4:01:12] <braincraft> Blur + poison is a comfy deck.
[4:01:28] <+PharosOfLight> Yes
[4:01:30] <%SirGO0SE> it can be
[4:01:32] <Doofmaster> @ghostfaceninja_ blocking is for nerds
[4:01:32] <SomeAsianDood> yup
[4:01:32] <%Gogogolem> yep
[4:01:33] <+AtlasMcCoy> Basically
[4:01:34] <whazat> basically, yes
[4:01:34] <CrimsonFox777> Pretty much. That and buff up the poison.
[4:01:34] <$spardanwarrior> Yep. Then just eait till they die
[4:01:35] <bashful_bard> Yep
[4:01:37] <%Visorak6> Yes
[4:01:38] <$spardanwarrior> wait
[4:01:38] <+RiceeFTW> it can be, poison can also glass cannon
[4:01:40] <%bevyrage> pretty much, though there's a means to expidite the poison and multi-stack it
[4:01:42] <+PharosOfLight> there's even a power card that passively adds poison each turn
[4:01:42] <Cosairen> he was deaaaaaaaaaaaad
[4:01:43] <%linSP> mmm poisson
[4:01:43] <%Visorak6> poison stall is a build
[4:01:43] <%afronooch> basically yeah
[4:01:43] <%Deano8817> not specifically but that works
[4:01:44] <heartlesshealer> you stack up poison until they can die when they start their turn, freeing up your actions
[4:01:45] <aeonicvector> @PatStaresAt keep stacks up and defend, or rush em down before they can hit you gud
[4:01:51] <%thebeargoesHONK> poison will do damage equal to poison number at end of each of your turns
[4:01:54] <+RiceeFTW> there's cards that DOUBLE poison
[4:01:54] <%darthfodder> yes. also Catalyst doubles or triples poison stacks
[4:01:56] <%linSP> yes
[4:01:56] <%Gogogolem> poison is effective for bosses.
[4:01:58] <%thebeargoesHONK> YES
[4:01:59] <%Arxel1> Yes
[4:01:59] <%SirGO0SE> yes
[4:02:00] <heartlesshealer> Yes
[4:02:00] <%DappercatEsquire> Yes
[4:02:00] <$spardanwarrior> Yes
[4:02:00] <lloyddboy> yup
[4:02:00] <CrimsonFox777> Yes
[4:02:01] <+AtlasMcCoy> Yes
[4:02:01] <%Grayhammatter> yes
[4:02:01] <%arancet> yes
[4:02:01] <%Broand> Yes
[4:02:01] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt Yes
[4:02:01] <%Deano8817> yup
[4:02:01] <@SSaryn> Correct.
[4:02:02] <Louie_Salmon> Yes
[4:02:02] <+agumon9000> yes
[4:02:02] <%walternatorz> correct
[4:02:02] <Doofmaster> @PatStaresAt correct
[4:02:02] <+TopTierHarley> it counts down
[4:02:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> Yes
[4:02:02] <$Fortunato5678> Yes
[4:02:02] <+PharosOfLight> yes
[4:02:02] <+RiceeFTW> yes
[4:02:03] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Correct
[4:02:03] <whazat> yes
[4:02:03] <%darthfodder> Yes
[4:02:04] <%AzureGale> Yes
[4:02:04] <%afronooch> yeah counts down
[4:02:04] <%CrookedSpiral> yes
[4:02:05] <%Broand> until it hits 0
[4:02:05] <SomeAsianDood> yup
[4:02:05] <LoneFonte> yeeeeeeeep
[4:02:05] <%Visorak6> 7>6>5
[4:02:06] <aeonicvector> 7 then 6 then 5 yeah
[4:02:06] <%thebeargoesHONK> each turn down by 1
[4:02:07] <%SirGO0SE> its a Factorial
[4:02:08] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt there's a card that triples poison stacks, it also stacks with itself so you can have like x243 poison
[4:02:09] <%Broand> which means it's very strong
[4:02:10] <+AtlasMcCoy> But you can add MORE poison
[4:02:10] <$lotharrio> Oh shit that's really strong.
[4:02:12] <%Visorak6> yes
[4:02:13] <%Broand> ooh well laid
[4:02:13] <whazat> it has very good over time damage
[4:02:13] <+RiceeFTW> so poison is REALLY good
[4:02:16] <%darthfodder> And adding more poison makes it go back up
[4:02:17] <Doofmaster> well laid pogs
[4:02:18] <CrimsonFox777> It is
[4:02:18] <ergulor> yup
[4:02:19] <+gumballwizard> Yes
[4:02:20] <%linSP> so stack that shit
[4:02:21] <%SirGO0SE> its amazing
[4:02:22] <bashful_bard> You can add onto iy
[4:02:27] <%Visorak6> PLANS
[4:02:27] <%Grayhammatter> oh boy
[4:02:28] <whazat> poison is great for elites and bosses
[4:02:29] <%Broand> Oh boy
[4:02:29] <heartlesshealer> so your potions
[4:02:31] <reonome> oh boy
[4:02:31] <+PharosOfLight> ugh, this guy
[4:02:32] <LoneFonte> OH NOOOOOOOOOO
[4:02:32] <+AtlasMcCoy> Oh no
[4:02:33] <braincraft> Stacking poison burns down bosses.
[4:02:33] <+TopTierHarley> Gremlin Knob
[4:02:34] <heartlesshealer> I recommend them
[4:02:34] <zazzera01> there's also a card that doubles and then triples poison when upgraded
[4:02:36] <whazat> oh this guy
[4:02:38] <%SirGO0SE> this guy enjoys stomping noobs
[4:02:42] <whazat> poison him now before things get crazy
[4:02:46] <heartlesshealer> I recommend those potions strongly
[4:02:47] <%thebeargoesHONK> Poison will ALSO get around enemies shields
[4:02:47] <%uncle_grumps> Git 'em!
[4:02:47] <%darthfodder> The facesmash guy
[4:02:51] <braincraft> And it's not an attack, so it's not affected by weakness or thorns.
[4:02:51] <SomeAsianDood> floated 1 KEKW
[4:02:56] <aeonicvector> pop a pot
[4:02:56] <0rond> this is basically a dps race
[4:02:57] <+RobotCo_Op> 31 raiders from RobotCo_Op have joined! 
[4:03:02] <%DEETRz> it says on the card
[4:03:02] <+RiceeFTW> it's time to race
[4:03:03] <CrimsonFox777> It'll say in the middle of the card
[4:03:04] <%walternatorz> under card art
[4:03:04] <+PharosOfLight> it says under the art
[4:03:04] <%Broand> under the image
[4:03:04] <lloyddboy> it says on the card
[4:03:06] <%DappercatEsquire> middle of the card text
[4:03:06] <%bevyrage> it says it's a skill on the card
[4:03:06] <%SirGO0SE> under the art
[4:03:06] <VritraReiRei> says it on the card
[4:03:06] <+AtlasMcCoy> Says it in the middle of the card
[4:03:07] <%darthfodder> it says skill on it
[4:03:07] <heartlesshealer> Lable under picture
[4:03:07] <whazat> it says at the bottom of the picture
[4:03:09] <%Grayhammatter> it will say "Skill"
[4:03:09] <LoneFonte> below the art
[4:03:09] <+TopTierHarley> read
[4:03:09] <0rond> it says under the picture
[4:03:10] <dapperskeleton69> card says skill
[4:03:10] <Mr_Strut> It will say skill
[4:03:11] <sectorquack> it says skill where it would say power or attack
[4:03:12] <%Visorak6> says
[4:03:12] <heartlesshealer> Label*
[4:03:12] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Reading is hard
[4:03:14] <%kknutson4> Pop a potion
[4:03:17] <+RiceeFTW> DPS RACE GO GO GO
[4:03:21] <whazat> also Square = Skill, Triangle = Attack, Circle = Power
[4:03:22] <%Calek> YOU WILL HAVE TO GUESS
[4:03:22] <%walternatorz> you have skills powers and attacks
[4:03:26] <VritraReiRei> time to use up potions!
[4:03:26] <%Arxel1> DPS RACE TIME
[4:03:26] <%Visorak6> RACING TIME
[4:03:27] <%Broand> Ah I'dve used well laid
[4:03:35] <+AtlasMcCoy> Oh no
[4:03:37] <Doofmaster> skills also have medium-rounded corners, attacks have sharp corners, and a different shaped image frame
[4:03:37] <rasamune> Oh it's the big slap man
[4:03:52] <%Visorak6> throw the fire at it
[4:03:54] <%DappercatEsquire> potions my dude
[4:03:56] <braincraft> If nothing else, playing it gets it out of your cycle.
[4:03:56] <%thebeargoesHONK> Powers will not go to graveyard after use. great way to thin your deck
[4:03:59] <%kknutson4> ya
[4:03:59] <lloyddboy> ya
[4:04:00] <+TopTierHarley> throw fire
[4:04:00] <heartlesshealer> power =/= skill, so powers are safe to play
[4:04:00] <bashful_bard> Elites are great potion targets
[4:04:01] <SomeAsianDood> capped at 3 potions might as well chuck 1
[4:04:01] <0rond> use the fire potion is less useful later on
[4:04:03] <%afronooch> yep
[4:04:05] <LoneFonte> the whole fight
[4:04:07] <%SirGO0SE> he unga
[4:04:08] <%Andrizzleton> RIP Prye
[4:04:14] <Mr_Strut> he mad
[4:04:19] <lloyddboy> nice
[4:04:21] <%DappercatEsquire> and you did it
[4:04:21] <heartlesshealer> fight over
[4:04:22] <+PharosOfLight> Power cards are passive effects
[4:04:23] <%walternatorz> powers don't affect his enrage
[4:04:26] <aeonicvector> end turn and you win
[4:04:33] <heartlesshealer> shiny new bag
[4:04:36] <braincraft> Bag is good.
[4:04:39] <%DappercatEsquire> BIG START DRAW
[4:04:39] <%Grayhammatter> wow
[4:04:39] <Louie_Salmon> Oh boy
[4:04:40] <bashful_bard> Nice
[4:04:41] <+AtlasMcCoy> ALL THE CARDS
[4:04:41] <%Gondor696969> Hi?
[4:04:42] <%afronooch> nice
[4:04:42] <rasamune> Ooh that's very good
[4:04:43] <%SirGO0SE> bag of prep is great
[4:04:44] <Louie_Salmon> 9 card opener
[4:04:44] <DXLelouch24> Hows Pat liking this?
[4:04:46] <%Grayhammatter> so many cards
[4:04:47] <aeonicvector> deflect is good
[4:04:47] <%Visorak6> BAG WOO
[4:04:48] <whazat> big cards, lots of options
[4:04:49] <braincraft> Piercing wail stops a lot of problems.
[4:04:50] <%SirGO0SE> you fucking bet
[4:04:51] <%Broand> for one turn
[4:04:51] <+YasQweenSLAY> It’s a race for who kills who first
[4:04:52] <0rond> you start with bag of prep
[4:04:53] <bashful_bard> Really good relic
[4:04:57] <heartlesshealer> choices =)
[4:04:58] <%darthfodder> Wail
[4:04:59] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt that can also be upgraded to give even MORE energy
[4:04:59] <$spardanwarrior> Upgrading that makes it give 3
[4:05:00] <LoneFonte> for one turn.
[4:05:01] <rasamune> He appears to be enjoying the game a lot
[4:05:01] <aeonicvector> all 3 are
[4:05:02] <%SirGO0SE> the ironclad is good but hes so meat and potatos
[4:05:03] <%linSP> that's bretty pog
[4:05:04] <%Broand> Wail is good strong too
[4:05:04] <0rond> @PatStaresAt pat cards a resource too, they aren't free
[4:05:06] <%DappercatEsquire> piercing wail can be a save
[4:05:09] <clockworknait1> bag of prep feels good on the hole
[4:05:09] <%afronooch> honestly hard to go wrong here
[4:05:09] <IceCreamAndAHug> Wail
[4:05:10] <%bevyrage> deflect is gonna help you out more
[4:05:10] <%ClericOfSparda> wail
[4:05:10] <%kknutson4> You spend 1 energy to get 2 next turn.
[4:05:11] <julrave> wail is one of my personal favs
[4:05:13] <%SirGO0SE> the other characters really show off whats up in this game
[4:05:13] <sectorquack> outmaneuver is deece
[4:05:13] <%Visorak6> wail can save your ass too
[4:05:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> deflect, you're gonna need some block cards and that one's free
[4:05:15] <%thebeargoesHONK> remember that cards can upgrade. i suggest looking into the stuff that reduces card cost.
[4:05:16] <braincraft> Ironclad is about getting HUGE.
[4:05:16] <bashful_bard> All are interesting
[4:05:18] <+metalwolfchaos> brok play god of war instead
[4:05:18] <+RiceeFTW> piercing wail is very useful
[4:05:18] <@SSaryn> Check all cards out, see their weaknesses and strengths.
[4:05:20] <$lotharrio> Piercing Wail is like getting 6 armor.
[4:05:23] <braincraft> Huge strength, huge defense.
[4:05:23] <Doofmaster> he says about the two cards that aren't great Kappa
[4:05:23] <$spardanwarrior> The only problem is finding when you can have the spare energy to use it
[4:05:24] <reonome> 2
[4:05:27] <%Andrizzleton> Outmaneuver is :buttkiss:
[4:05:32] <%Mendin> Silent is extremely "DO COMBO" vs Ironclad's "BIG NUMBER"
[4:05:33] <%kknutson4> 1 and done
[4:05:33] <whazat> Strength can go negative
[4:05:33] <heartlesshealer> One-time use per battle
[4:05:34] <%linSP> 1 turn only
[4:05:35] <%SirGO0SE> you can look at your deck in top right
[4:05:35] <aeonicvector> -6 dmg per unit yes
[4:05:36] <+RiceeFTW> @lotharrio times 6 for every enemy
[4:05:37] <0rond> it's 6 armor per enemy, and if they attack multiple times it's more
[4:05:37] <$lotharrio> -6 damage from each attack.
[4:05:38] <+Lazy_Vagabond> piercing wail can effectivly be +6 block
[4:05:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> this turn only
[4:05:39] <julrave> you get to use it once person encounter yeah
[4:05:40] <%thebeargoesHONK> they do 6 less damage for a turn
[4:05:41] <%SirGO0SE> think about what you might want to build around
[4:05:41] <%bevyrage> you can only use piercing wail once, but it drops damage by 6 for the turn
[4:05:41] <%Grayhammatter> free block though
[4:05:41] <%afronooch> 1 turn per fight
[4:05:44] <%Visorak6> -6 damage to all enemies THIS turn
[4:05:44] <%thebeargoesHONK> it's bad
[4:05:47] <@SSaryn> They'll lose 1 attack. Which means multi-hits can sometimes do no damage.
[4:05:50] <haitakaa> pierce the weil
[4:05:50] <%walternatorz> look at your boss on the level if you're considering cards
[4:05:53] <%bevyrage> always go free block
[4:05:55] <braincraft> Strength is +damage, so -6 strength is -6 damage to each hit. It stops multiattacks.
[4:05:56] <%darthfodder> Wail is super good
[4:05:57] <%SirGO0SE> its fine to take your time on picks
[4:06:00] <heartlesshealer> choices are here
[4:06:01] <%Andrizzleton> Upgraded Outmaneuver is why you get it
[4:06:03] <aeonicvector> wail beats crowds, deflect is well rounded, manuver is if you DPS master
[4:06:09] <lloyddboy> ELITE YOU COWARD
[4:06:10] <%Broand> Nice
[4:06:10] <%Grayhammatter> oh wow
[4:06:12] <%SirGO0SE> GAME CHANGER
[4:06:12] <%DappercatEsquire> Wail can 0 out multiple enemies hitting for low amounts
[4:06:12] <whazat> poison
[4:06:16] <julrave> POISON
[4:06:16] <%bevyrage> POISON YEAAAAAAAAAH
[4:06:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> enjoying your little card monster game pat?
[4:06:16] <LoneFonte> if a enemy goes to hit 6x2 they hit 0x2 @PatStaresAt
[4:06:16] <aeonicvector> Poison 0u0]
[4:06:16] <%thebeargoesHONK> POISON
[4:06:19] <+ghostfaceninja_> such a good relic
[4:06:22] <%afronooch> P O I S O N
[4:06:25] <%Visorak6> POISON
[4:06:27] <braincraft> Honestly, getting the poison stacking early is good.
[4:06:28] <%SirGO0SE> now you can build a poison deck because you will reliably have poison
[4:06:28] <whazat> stronk start to every fight
[4:06:29] <%Grayhammatter> LUL

[4:06:47] <+TopTierHarley> PAT
[4:06:47] <heartlesshealer> pat no
[4:06:50] <+Rofiarf> should have used the 0 cost card
[4:06:51] <braincraft> Should have used neutralize, it's free.

[4:06:52] <VritraReiRei> Neutralize was free
[4:06:52] <IceCreamAndAHug> Neutralize you fool

[4:07:00] <heartlesshealer> LUL NotLikeThis
[4:07:05] <heartlesshealer> it's fine
[4:07:06] <lloyddboy> TINY NET
[4:07:11] <%SirGO0SE> omai wa
[4:07:15] <braincraft> See, it's not an attack, so you can still use poison.
[4:07:15] <%DappercatEsquire> still won tho
[4:07:16] <sectorquack> ive been there
[4:07:20] <+Jaysky> No I won
[4:07:24] <lloyddboy> @kknutson4 give me that mod NOW
[4:07:25] <Louie_Salmon> Oh boy
[4:07:25] <whazat> The Silent has a lot of free cards
[4:07:28] <heartlesshealer> UMM
[4:07:29] <Darkfire346> @kknutson4 BONK Go to horny jail
[4:07:32] <SomeAsianDood> wraith doesn't feel worth
[4:07:33] <+RiceeFTW> oh god
[4:07:34] <%bevyrage> wraith form for avoiding big damage
[4:07:35] <+ghostfaceninja_> choke/shiv decks Kreygasm
[4:07:36] <%thebeargoesHONK> my favorite item on this guy is the one where you do a point of poison per attack (this guy has a lot of multi attacks)
[4:07:37] <%linSP> did they fix wraith form?
[4:07:38] <rasamune> Ooooh Wraith Form
[4:07:38] <Louie_Salmon> I don't think Pat is ready
[4:07:38] <%SirGO0SE> wraith is good but you have to build around it
[4:07:40] <%Grayhammatter> uh....
[4:07:41] <+RiceeFTW> losing 1 dex is BAD
[4:07:43] <@SSaryn> Wraith is just good. It's just take 1 damage no matter what.
[4:07:43] <LoneFonte> hmmmmmmm
[4:07:44] <%DappercatEsquire> Wraith is meh unless you can mitigate the dex loss
[4:07:44] <bashful_bard> This is not a hard pick
[4:07:45] <%walternatorz> wraith form is broken in future floors
[4:07:45] <%thebeargoesHONK> Dex= block
[4:07:47] <%SirGO0SE> choke is probably the pick here
[4:07:48] <aeonicvector> its a weird defense skill, but your DEFENCSE cards get nerfed
[4:07:50] <$HyperionXV> Negative dexterity reduces block gain
[4:07:51] <+PharosOfLight> basically its two turns of invincibility followed by progrssivly weaker blocks
[4:07:51] <heartlesshealer> You are not ready for Wraith strats
[4:07:52] <whazat> wraith can be quite bad because you end up losing a ton of dex in long fights
[4:07:54] <lloyddboy> CHOKE ME MOMMY
[4:07:54] <%Grayhammatter> choke
[4:07:55] <Doofmaster> @PatStaresAt essentially invincible 2 turns, but block from cards ticks down all fight
[4:07:56] <%darthfodder> Wraith
[4:07:57] <+RiceeFTW> but wraith form is super useful
[4:07:58] <%Visorak6> choke I say
[4:08:00] <%Arxel1> Wraith Form is BIG BRAIN card
[4:08:00] <Louie_Salmon> Oh, it's only 2? Eh, maybe not then
[4:08:05] <%darthfodder> Wail is good too
[4:08:07] <%afronooch> choke is okay
[4:08:09] <%linSP> emlo screm
[4:08:14] <%SirGO0SE> yeah wraith form is for when you know whats coming
[4:08:15] <%bevyrage> choke would have been solid since you keep getting options to build more actions
[4:08:17] <%darthfodder> Choke is fine
[4:08:17] <%Visorak6> no balls
[4:08:18] <Explodincatz> wail is one of silents bests cards
[4:08:21] <+gumballwizard> Wraith used to be great
[4:08:23] <+ghostfaceninja_> i can feel the heads shaking
[4:08:27] <%thebeargoesHONK> AGAIN. you CAN choose to not pick up a card (thus keeping your deck small, and having a higher chance to get what you want)
[4:08:30] <%Bane_Kaikyo> CAW CAWWWW
[4:08:30] <%darthfodder> wraith is good near the end of a fight.
[4:08:36] <Darkfire346> OH SHIT i JUST noticed emlo laying there
[4:08:50] <heartlesshealer> nice
[4:08:52] <+ghostfaceninja_> @thebeargoeshonk, but number go up
[4:08:52] <rasamune> hi emlo
[4:08:53] <whazat> piercing wail definitely
[4:08:54] <%thebeargoesHONK> WAIL
[4:09:03] <%SirGO0SE> wail gave you a dead hand there
[4:09:04] <%kknutson4> Waifu the Spire in Steam Workshop
[4:09:04] <%bevyrage> is exhaust permament or for the fight? i don't remember which it was
[4:09:04] <heartlesshealer> strength subtraction is like a false block
[4:09:13] <%SirGO0SE> but you should have used it lol
[4:09:13] <%thebeargoesHONK> but small number= damage number go up
[4:09:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> poison can be fu nas fuck
[4:09:16] <+RiceeFTW> gg he ded
[4:09:19] <CrimsonFox777> @bevyrage Just for the fight
[4:09:20] <braincraft> Doublecasting bottle is sick.
[4:09:20] <bashful_bard> Thin decks don't matter in this game if you're gonna pass good cards
[4:09:26] <SomeAsianDood> yes perm for the combat @bevyrage
[4:09:26] <%darthfodder> Wow more poison
[4:09:27] <$spardanwarrior> You do combo and get big number, what's not to like?
[4:09:28] <%bevyrage> ah cool
[4:09:30] <%darthfodder> luck
[4:09:31] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt poison goes through block, its great
[4:09:35] <%AzureGale> Dead rats
[4:09:36] <aeonicvector> poison both
[4:09:36] <%Grayhammatter> double poison PogChamp
[4:09:39] <rasamune> ewww it's a cordyceps
[4:09:39] <%walternatorz> did those rats eat potato salad?
[4:09:45] <+RiceeFTW> they took rats and made them even more gross
[4:09:50] <lloyddboy> math
[4:09:52] <%SirGO0SE> potion
[4:09:54] <heartlesshealer> yup
[4:09:55] <%Visorak6> paige's potato salad has returned
[4:09:56] <+ghostfaceninja_> debuffs are fine.... until you meet an enemy who's immune to debuffs
[4:10:01] <CrimsonFox777> Sadly, math is actually a big part of these games.
[4:10:01] <%kknutson4> Do math
[4:10:09] <+Rofiarf> i never realised those are rats
[4:10:09] <heartlesshealer> so wail
[4:10:14] <%Andrizzleton> Show me potato salad
[4:10:19] <%thebeargoesHONK> plan + wail + attack
[4:10:27] <braincraft> Probably should have retained the wail.
[4:10:29] <%bevyrage> strike the healthy one
[4:10:31] <%SirGO0SE> @PatStaresAt if a potion kills an enemy or saves you some health, 90% of the time you should use it
[4:10:40] <aeonicvector> powers are passives you cast once
[4:10:46] <whazat> you can also choose to not retain a card i think
[4:10:46] <lloyddboy> It's no Pyramid
[4:10:50] <+RiceeFTW> and the power persists so it's not just one time lol
[4:10:50] <%SirGO0SE> if the scenario is that you wouldnt be able to otherwise*
[4:10:57] <sectorquack> pyramid is sooo good
[4:11:05] <%Visorak6> Its for holding the right card until the right turn to go nuts @PatStaresAt
[4:11:10] <%SirGO0SE> because if you get max potions, you have to throw one away
[4:11:14] <%darthfodder> Defect is my favorite character
[4:11:16] <heartlesshealer> umm
[4:11:18] <heartlesshealer> oh no
[4:11:21] <%Broand> yeah dude
[4:11:22] <aeonicvector> THE ENTIRE FIGHT
[4:11:23] <@SSaryn> ye
[4:11:23] <LoneFonte> every turn
[4:11:24] <%Broand> It's a power
[4:11:25] <%kknutson4> Now that you're getting the hang of it, turn on fast mode to speed up your runs
[4:11:25] <rasamune> It's every turn
[4:11:26] <CrimsonFox777> Powers are for the duration of the fight.
[4:11:27] <reonome> yes pat its a power
[4:11:29] <%linSP> powers are passives
[4:11:30] <%Keyd00d> Aw yeah this game rules
[4:11:31] <%afronooch> yeah
[4:11:31] <@SSaryn> Used to cost 0.
[4:11:32] <lloyddboy> POGPAT
[4:11:34] <whazat> powers last the whole fight
[4:11:34] <+RiceeFTW> powers persist yes
[4:11:39] <rocksolidfromdragonsdogma> ohio;
[4:11:40] <sectorquack> powers are basically enchantments
[4:11:40] <CrimsonFox777> SHIVS PogChamp
[4:11:44] <+ghostfaceninja_> power is passive that lasts all fight
[4:11:46] <heartlesshealer> Powers are entire battle
[4:11:47] <%darthfodder> yep. upgraded version is TWO cards
[4:11:48] <%bevyrage> blade dance is good
[4:11:49] <rasamune> Bladey dancey
[4:11:49] <sectorquack> SHIV
[4:11:49] <%SirGO0SE> blade dance combos with choke but no choke :(
[4:11:50] <%Grayhammatter> shivs PogChamp
[4:11:51] <%afronooch> shivs are good
[4:11:52] <+AtlasMcCoy> SHEEV
[4:11:53] <bashful_bard> Oh no
[4:11:53] <%darthfodder> it used to cost 0
[4:11:54] <rasamune> Knives for the knife god
[4:11:55] <heartlesshealer> !
[4:11:57] <0rond> shiv decks are sick
[4:11:57] <lloyddboy> BELT
[4:11:57] <+TopTieramisu> powers are like relics you equip mid-fight
[4:11:58] <+RiceeFTW> if you upgrade it, does it get to 0 cost or do you just save more than 1 card?
[4:12:00] <%darthfodder> that was pretty broken
[4:12:00] <%thebeargoesHONK> Shiv's are a zero mana 4 damage card
[4:12:01] <%Visorak6> blade dance is awesome for choke builds
[4:12:02] <%Brickhaus_> always good to drop a card
[4:12:02] <braincraft> Escape plan is basically free.
[4:12:03] <zazzera01> SPOON
[4:12:04] <0rond> shiv decks are teh actual goolest
[4:12:04] <sectorquack> shiv builds are ridiculous
[4:12:07] <%bevyrage> remove strikes?

[4:12:20] <0rond> spoon is pretty bad with shivs
[4:12:24] <sectorquack> ENTRANCE
[4:12:25] <heartlesshealer> Removing a card costs 75 money

[4:14:09] <Doofmaster> casually blocking for 36 with 1 energy, no big
[4:14:09] <zazzera01> Spoon comin in clutch
[4:14:10] <IceCreamAndAHug> He's learning
[4:14:12] <$Fortunato5678> Good fucking turn to use that on
[4:14:13] <Louie_Salmon> And he still has it, thanks to spoon
[4:14:15] <%linSP> how is he this smart
[4:14:15] <%Spydurman> FUCK YA
[4:14:18] <bashful_bard> Huge
[4:14:20] <heartlesshealer> Bosses are almost always worth using the generic potions
[4:14:23] <aeonicvector> thats the power of wailing
[4:14:27] <LoneFonte> @Louie_Salmon well, he's also not using fast mode
[4:14:31] <sectorquack> look at all this chaff
[4:14:34] <%Broand> this is a game woolie would like, he was talking up this sort of "know what your enemy does before they do it" gameplay
[4:14:37] <Doofmaster> this fight's a DPS race
[4:14:39] <%DappercatEsquire> bosses are a good time for potions
[4:14:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Could also use a potion, if you want to actively combat the goblins
[4:14:42] <%SirGO0SE> the burn begin
[4:14:47] <%Visorak6> might as well throw your fire and use strength
[4:14:51] <bashful_bard> Spoon wail is pretty good. I'm just worried about the shivs
[4:14:56] <+TopTieramisu> ehhhh
[4:14:57] <%kknutson4> I like saving fire potions for early lethal
[4:14:58] <sectorquack> might as well use that fire potion
[4:15:01] <heartlesshealer> thank you for first activation, Spoon o7
[4:15:16] <whazat> keep stacking that poison
[4:15:18] <aeonicvector> just fyi, your wail exausts, which, givne spoon, means 50% chance of NOT returning for the fight
[4:15:24] <%darthfodder> It doesn't matter on A0, but this boss is one where the optimal strat is aggression.
[4:15:25] <%Broand> Take de poison
[4:15:35] <%Grayhammatter> oh nice, another spoon proc
[4:15:36] <braincraft> He can wait to use the fire potion until he's within kill distance.
[4:15:37] <LoneFonte> hopefully pat gets envenom
[4:15:42] <reonome> i love poison
[4:15:44] <whazat> survivor to discard burn
[4:15:46] <0rond> no that's a bad spoon proc
[4:15:48] <%thebeargoesHONK> power up turn
[4:15:50] <braincraft> Use survivor to discard the burn.
[4:15:50] <0rond> you don't want to draw shivs
[4:15:50] <%DappercatEsquire> use survivor and discard the burn
[4:15:51] <%bevyrage> you can use survivor to discard the burn
[4:15:51] <%linSP> bluff
[4:15:51] <$lotharrio> Discard that burn.
[4:15:55] <0rond> they are bad cards
[4:15:55] <%SirGO0SE> NO
[4:15:56] <reonome> BURN
[4:15:58] <%Visorak6> discard the burn
[4:15:58] <%Keyd00d> gotta get them double/triple poison cards
[4:15:58] <%Brickhaus_> F
[4:15:58] <%DappercatEsquire> ...
[4:15:58] <%bevyrage> pat please
[4:15:58] <heartlesshealer> Pat did not see
[4:16:00] <reonome> lol
[4:16:00] <+RiceeFTW> noooooo
[4:16:00] <%SirGO0SE> that was almost poggers
[4:16:01] <+metalwolfchaos> so when you put thor brok and sindri on earth you get exactly this
[4:16:08] <%Visorak6> FUG
[4:16:10] <+TopTieramisu> it didn't matter y'all
[4:16:13] <PassedShelfDate> Hi, Pat the human, Elmo the cat, and Zangief the dog. Rikk Wolf, of Robot Co-Op speaks well of you.Pat, I have to wake up early, tomorrow, so I'm going to turn in. Have fun, and stay safe.
[4:16:13] <%Deano8817> you can discard garbage yeah
[4:16:14] <%Spydurman> LUL
[4:16:14] <%bevyrage> you can discard unplayable cards, like burn, wounds, etc
[4:16:15] <%Grayhammatter> you could have discarded that burn
[4:16:15] <heartlesshealer> Unplayable =/= unable to discard
[4:16:15] <CrimsonFox777> Burn doesn't trigger if it's not in your hand. @PatStaresAt
[4:16:15] <raveous> the burns are cards too
[4:16:15] <+RiceeFTW> you can discard status/debuff cards
[4:16:15] <whazat> you can discard status effect cards
[4:16:16] <%Brickhaus_> Burn burns you if it stays in your hand at the end of your turn
[4:16:18] <+nictron90> Didn't actually matter in that instance but yeah
[4:16:18] <%thebeargoesHONK> burn hurts you at end of turn. so use cards to discard to avoid damage
[4:16:20] <$spardanwarrior> Discard the burn card so it can't hurt you
[4:16:20] <whazat> it didn't matter but is good to learn
[4:16:21] <zenith0111> SLAY THAT SPIRE
[4:16:21] <+metalwolfchaos> fucking hel
[4:16:23] <reonome> if you discard the burn it doesn't damage you
[4:16:23] <$lotharrio> He threw a debuff on you. You coulda discarded it instead of an attack.
[4:16:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> He's safe
[4:16:27] <bashful_bard> That case the discard didn't matter
[4:16:33] <lloyddboy> with discard cards
[4:16:34] <%Laecerelius> With discard cards
[4:16:34] <%DappercatEsquire> anything that lets you discard
[4:16:35] <%Agami23> with cards that discard
[4:16:35] <Louie_Salmon> Discard them...?
[4:16:36] <%SirGO0SE> by clicking them when it asks what you want to discard
[4:16:38] <IceCreamAndAHug> With defender
[4:16:39] <+AtlasMcCoy> With a card that discards
[4:16:39] <aeonicvector> like with your "discard a card" earlier
[4:16:39] <%bevyrage> your cards that let you choose a discard let you discard cards
[4:16:40] <whazat> when you use Survivor it lets you discard a card, including status effects
[4:16:40] <CrimsonFox777> Need a card that discards it
[4:16:41] <%Visorak6> with survivor
[4:16:42] <heartlesshealer> With cards that tell you to discard things
[4:16:43] <rasamune> When a card asks you to discard, prioritize status effects over all otheres
[4:16:44] <+dr1ove> played this game for over 110 hours and still love playing it.
[4:16:44] <reonome> you had a discard card
[4:16:45] <%Broand> Use a card with a "Discard a card" effect
[4:16:45] <+RiceeFTW> the card you had said "discard 1 card"
[4:16:46] <$lotharrio> You had a card that forced a discard.
[4:16:46] <@SSaryn> Needs to be through Discard or certain relics.
[4:16:46] <%Profmcstevie> Discard it like a normal card
[4:16:49] <bashful_bard> With survivor
[4:16:49] <0rond> statuses and curses are cards too, when you discard a card, you can discard them
[4:16:58] <%Keyd00d> just a tip for later
[4:16:59] <$spardanwarrior> GG
[4:17:05] <+Pobega> imagine reading tho, overrated
[4:17:06] <+TopTieramisu> block and you're gravy
[4:17:09] <lloyddboy> ded next turn

[4:17:10] <heartlesshealer> Good fight, good job
[4:17:10] <%za7az> @SSaryn We might not agree on the best card in the game, but can we agree that this is the best song in the game?
[4:17:12] <%Broand> use the potion!
[4:17:12] <%thebeargoesHONK> use 2nd potion
[4:17:13] <%bevyrage> retain survivor
[4:17:16] <braincraft> That's why being able to discard and exhaust cards is good, it gets rid of trash in your deck.
[4:17:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> WHY
[4:17:16] <+TopTieramisu> why
[4:17:16] <whazat> discard can be really useful when you've got trash in your deck
[4:17:20] <CrimsonFox777> You had a potion though
[4:17:20] <%Agami23> fights basically won as long as pat doesen't somehow do something real dumb
[4:17:21] <IceCreamAndAHug> ????
[4:17:22] <heartlesshealer> too late for potion

[4:18:06] <%Keyd00d> I'd go alchemize
[4:18:07] <Doofmaster> I am going into battle, I require your strongest potions!
[4:18:07] <ChungusQuest> yeah, you kill that fire with poison
[4:18:07] <heartlesshealer> oh

[4:18:17] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> yeah dome is garbo
[4:18:17] <+ghostfaceninja_> bosses give you top tier cards
[4:18:18] <%kknutson4> do key
[4:18:18] <sectorquack> theyre all usually like this
[4:18:19] <%linSP> CHAOS
[4:18:19] <%afronooch> Key
[4:18:19] <%Visorak6> NOT DOME
[4:18:22] <@SSaryn> I mean, if you're blocking anyway, Dome can be good.
[4:18:22] <0rond> yeah that's a veteran relic
[4:18:22] <$Fortunato5678> These all suck
[4:18:23] <Lophostrix_> ALL BAD SKIP
[4:18:23] <IceCreamAndAHug> Coffee is the play
[4:18:24] <%AzureGale> That also sucks
[4:18:24] <+TopTieramisu> key
[4:18:25] <Doofmaster> pick your poison
[4:18:25] <whazat> cursed key might be your best bet
[4:18:25] <Onamar> Key
[4:18:26] <+PharosOfLight> Key
[4:18:26] <%Laecerelius> Woof
[4:18:26] <Aluminar> dripper is good actually
[4:18:26] <%darthfodder> Yeah it makes the game not fum
[4:18:27] <sectorquack> key is good if you have constant discard
[4:18:27] <%thebeargoesHONK> TEA CUP
[4:18:28] <%Arxel1> key is least worst
[4:18:29] <Louie_Salmon> Cursed key or coffee are probably best
[4:18:29] <$Fortunato5678> Skip
[4:18:30] <%bevyrage> these are bad
[4:18:31] <$spardanwarrior> Key?
[4:18:31] <whazat> you can also skip if you want
[4:18:31] <heartlesshealer> Curse IN ADDITION to normal chest stuff
[4:18:31] <%ClericOfSparda> skip
[4:18:32] <+BigCoffee> skip
[4:18:32] <ergulor> key
[4:18:32] <braincraft> You can get extra energy, but it always screws you.
[4:18:33] <%Keyd00d> key
[4:18:33] <+A_mere_shrubb> Oof
[4:18:35] <Aluminar> take coffee
[4:18:35] <Doofmaster> you can skip here but you probably shouldn't
[4:18:36] <%darthfodder> Key probably
[4:18:36] <aeonicvector> key imop
[4:18:37] <CrimsonFox777> You CAN skip, but key wouldn't necessarily be THAT bad.
[4:18:38] <bashful_bard> Key is great
[4:18:38] <%afronooch> Key is literally a non-issue
[4:18:38] <zenith0111> KEY
[4:18:39] <DashXero> Can we just not?
[4:18:39] <+agumon9000> Key is amazing
[4:18:39] <sectorquack> go with key
[4:18:40] <%thebeargoesHONK> Key is alright
[4:18:40] <0rond> in low asc you can skip them
[4:18:40] <%Spydurman> key or skip
[4:18:41] <%bevyrage> cursed key you can avoid chests at least
[4:18:42] <+PharosOfLight> Extra energy is OP, they're worth it
[4:18:42] <%AzureGale> That sucks as well
[4:18:42] <%linSP> key is good, you get like 2 curses
[4:18:43] <heartlesshealer> THEY ALL SUCK
[4:18:43] <+TopTieramisu> you can't skip, chat
[4:18:43] <$spardanwarrior> But 4 energy though
[4:18:43] <+agumon9000> @PatStaresAt Take the Key
[4:18:43] <%SirGO0SE> theyre all high iq items
[4:18:44] <%Agami23> cant skip relic chests
[4:18:44] <$lotharrio> This seems like a rough one.
[4:18:44] <Ids560> coffeed dripper's great, just don't get hit 4Head
[4:18:45] <Explodincatz> key or sjkip
[4:18:46] <+Sumdumguyy> the key is the most tgolerable one
[4:18:46] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> you can choose to not take
[4:18:46] <+BigCoffee> key
[4:18:46] <braincraft> Sometimes you can work around it, like decks that use curses for fuel.
[4:18:47] <+YasQweenSLAY> The key
[4:18:47] <sectorquack> key key key
[4:18:48] <+metalwolfchaos> brok you should play something else
[4:18:49] <+DGenerator> Key because you can pay to remove cards
[4:18:50] <+ghostfaceninja_> NotLikeThis
[4:18:51] <%Keyd00d> gaining energy is worth a lot of risks
[4:18:52] <%Visorak6> All energy relics have a downside
[4:18:52] <Doofmaster> 4 energy is very good
[4:18:53] <+AtlasMcCoy> Extra energy is REALLY good
[4:18:53] <+Sumdumguyy> you can remove curses at the shopkeeper so key is the best you can get
[4:18:56] <%Spydurman> Shop can remove curse cards
[4:18:58] <lbrownthedestroyer> key
[4:18:59] <Mirrorcatch> key is good since you can sometimes discard curses
[4:18:59] <+Walopoh> LUL there's a bunch of "extra energy, but fuck you" relics
[4:18:59] <%Laecerelius> yeah at least the curses can be taken out of your deck I guess
[4:18:59] <%echobee_tv> Key it up
[4:18:59] <%SirGO0SE> ya key is the right choice
[4:19:00] <%linSP> you can remove curses
[4:19:02] <+RiceeFTW> this floor is the bane of my existence somehow
[4:19:02] <Cosairen> sometimes you just cant get rid of a bomb
[4:19:04] <+admiral_of_crunch> Oh shit it's about goddamn time he got to Slay the Spire
[4:19:05] <Mirrorcatch> or remove them at shops
[4:19:05] <Darkfire346> is Pat now the keymaster?
[4:19:07] <sectorquack> thats not true lantern is just good

[4:19:14] <Mr_Strut> Rematch!
[4:19:14] <%SirGO0SE> youre going to come at him so hard with 4 energy now
[4:19:15] <%bevyrage> oh yeah that's right, you can remove curse cards at a shop
[4:19:15] <$spardanwarrior> Poison hits through shields
[4:19:16] <+metalwolfchaos> hammer master
[4:19:16] <whazat> you can sell or get rid of curse cards from some question mark rooms
[4:19:16] <%darthfodder> Every time I take teacup I die
[4:19:21] <%Spydurman> Shops and sometimes events can remove the curse cards
[4:19:22] <heartlesshealer> dump all that poison mmm mmm mmm
[4:19:22] <braincraft> Poison ignores block, btw.
[4:19:22] <Doofmaster> poison doesn't care about his plated armor
[4:19:23] <+RiceeFTW> poison goes through armor
[4:19:23] <whazat> poison goes through block
[4:19:24] <0rond> @PatStaresAt all energy relics have these downsides, it's a meaningful choice but in higher difficulty runs you pretty much have to take them
[4:19:25] <+PharosOfLight> poison him, it goes through block
[4:19:25] <%SirGO0SE> this guy HATES poison
[4:19:25] <%AzureGale> Poison the mofo
[4:19:26] <%Visorak6> POISON goes through block
[4:19:26] <%Grayhammatter> poison hits through shields
[4:19:27] <aeonicvector> biggest poisons you can
[4:19:28] <%Laecerelius> Poison ignores shields so great for armor bois
[4:19:29] <%kknutson4> poison bypasses armor
[4:19:29] <CrimsonFox777> Poison ignores block
[4:19:30] <%linSP> poisson goes thru armore

[4:19:41] <+ghostfaceninja_> yea there's several energy relics without debuff
[4:19:47] <Darkfire346> it looks like a sentient beehive
[4:19:51] <heartlesshealer> raw health damage <3
[4:19:54] <%darthfodder> Teacup works better with Ironclad and certain relics

[4:21:19] <%Agami23> oh god i just realized that pats alchemize isnt exhausting because of the spoon. holy shit
[4:21:19] <$KnivesEve> do it again
[4:21:21] <+Walopoh> LUL
[4:21:22] <braincraft> This is why you wanna use mouse/keyboard instead of controller.
[4:21:23] <%Keyd00d> This is why I KBM this game
[4:21:26] <%Capn_Trips> #sponsored
[4:21:29] <+dr1ove> happens to me too
[4:21:31] <%thebeargoesHONK> starts in hand
[4:21:34] <%bevyrage> this is the reason why a lot of people who play this game only play on m&kb
[4:21:36] <+RiceeFTW> starts in your hand
[4:21:37] <sectorquack> you always start with innate cards
[4:21:38] <Onamar> Backstab or skip
[4:21:39] <%afronooch> Innate starts in hand
[4:21:39] <heartlesshealer> oh
[4:21:41] <%Visorak6> backstab for sure
[4:21:42] <aeonicvector> thats a free 11 damage opener...
[4:21:43] <+admiral_of_crunch> Mouse motherfuck
[4:21:45] <%Grayhammatter> innate means it starts in your hand
[4:21:45] <zenith0111> Exhaust PogChamp
[4:21:47] <%Spydurman> backstab
[4:21:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Backstab was really good there
[4:21:50] <+RiceeFTW> backstab is free damage lol
[4:21:50] <Doofmaster> CA CAW
[4:21:52] <+metalwolfchaos> looked like muscle memory right there
[4:21:54] <%SirGO0SE> draw first as a rule
[4:21:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> since you have spoon
[4:21:56] <heartlesshealer> so your potions, specifically the new one
[4:21:57] <Louie_Salmon> I mean you definitely can, but sure
[4:22:00] <sectorquack> neutralize him
[4:22:02] <braincraft> You're at the point where you might have too much draw, actually.
[4:22:04] <+ghostfaceninja_> this is your punish for the travesty that is playing this game on pc with a controller
[4:22:11] <sectorquack> BLADE DANCE
[4:22:16] <bashful_bard> Innate is questionable with this many t1 draws
[4:22:22] <%Grayhammatter> free shivs are nice
[4:22:34] <+metalwolfchaos> now actually start forgin the damn thing brok talk to sindri
[4:22:37] <heartlesshealer> eh, it can help or hinder
[4:22:38] <%kknutson4> Backstab is good with the spoon
[4:22:38] <%SirGO0SE> innate is amazing if youre building a deck that needs those cards
[4:22:40] <+Sumdumguyy> it is but only sometimes
[4:22:41] <sectorquack> it depends on your character
[4:22:42] <%Agami23> innates good on some stuff.
[4:22:43] <+PharosOfLight> innate is good on some things, Powers are great to have it on
[4:22:46] <lloyddboy> but bottled gives innate
[4:22:46] <Doofmaster> every time someone calls a card "free" I die a bit
[4:22:46] <%SirGO0SE> its a way to guarantee an opener
[4:22:48] <0rond> nah backstab is pretty good
[4:22:49] <sectorquack> its insane with the defect
[4:22:50] <+metalwolfchaos> i aint got time for this shit anymore
[4:22:50] <%Brickhaus_> I hope he gets to meet Chad Thundercock
[4:22:55] <zenith0111> Slay his dick off
[4:22:56] <$RealThiele> dead branch go brrrr
[4:23:04] <+admiral_of_crunch> Oh dammit Pat your face is in front of the mana pool.
[4:23:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> it was a 0 cost, 11 damage innate that had a 50/50 chance of being discarded instead of destroyed
[4:23:11] <Ids560> oh boy dazes with spoon
[4:23:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> not awful
[4:23:26] <sectorquack> i wish i could see how much energy he has
[4:23:30] <%SirGO0SE> bordeline great tbh
[4:23:30] <heartlesshealer> Pat will learn
[4:23:35] <IceCreamAndAHug> Drink gamblers ok nvm
[4:23:39] <heartlesshealer> so gamble potion is silly
[4:23:40] <%SirGO0SE> ^
[4:23:45] <%Grayhammatter> EZ
[4:23:57] <sectorquack> that was style
[4:23:58] <Mr_Strut> Guess I'll die
[4:24:02] <+metalwolfchaos> good shit brok

[4:24:05] <%SirGO0SE> psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:24:06] <+PharosOfLight> wait till you try the other guy with a big strength build
[4:24:06] <whazat> ironclad gets quite good once you get the strength stacking bullshit
[4:24:08] <Manwad> i can't wait for pat to unlock the third character
[4:24:08] <%Agami23> wait until you see the third character lol. you will love him
[4:24:09] <+transporterthesequel> Pat loves big poison cheats
[4:24:10] <+Walopoh> Yeah same
[4:24:11] <aeonicvector> yeah, he's a "blue" mtg deck by comparison to heavy red
[4:24:18] <%Keyd00d> Defect is BAE
[4:24:19] <%Visorak6> you have to see the different build types on each character
[4:24:19] <%Bailey__gaming> wait till u get defect
[4:24:20] <+Walopoh> Huntress is so satisfying on a good run
[4:24:21] <+superdeliverer> The robot is the best
[4:24:21] <heartlesshealer> now pat has both of the Temporary Buff potions
[4:24:22] <zenith0111> Gamblers brew BibleThump
[4:24:23] <Doofmaster> omg this fight
[4:24:25] <braincraft> Poison is great fun, because you get to turn away from your opponent and say: "OMAE WA MOU SHINDEIRU."
[4:24:26] <%Grayhammatter> monkaS
[4:24:26] <%thebeargoesHONK> Pat REALLY needs to stop picking up cards
[4:24:28] <$RealThiele> predator yo

[4:24:41] <%Keyd00d> CA CAW
[4:24:42] <braincraft> It's fine, you have plenty of energy.
[4:24:46] <%Visorak6> stack poison on the bitch immediately
[4:24:46] <whazat> poison is your friend
[4:24:47] <$RealThiele> pat likes her cause MORE cards
[4:24:47] <%Bailey__gaming> sip sip
[4:24:48] <%Brickhaus_> Slowing down and counting would be advised
[4:24:48] <+admiral_of_crunch> Predator's good, but what does his deck look like?
[4:24:48] <lloyddboy> NOOT NOOT HIM
[4:24:50] <%Laecerelius> Well you got big poisons

[4:25:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hi everyone what's goin on
[4:25:06] <braincraft> Deflect, neutralize, and a block takes care of his damage, spend the rest of your energy doing big poison.

[4:25:11] <Darkfire346> NOOT NOOT
[4:25:21] <zenith0111> Let the shroom live :)

[4:25:55] <heartlesshealer> eat potion get potion
[4:25:55] <Rionxgarland> anyone figure out the episode of ridiculosness that pat and paige was on
[4:25:58] <SomeAsianDood> Has he found a catalyst yet?
[4:26:05] <braincraft> Acrobatics to draw into more poison.
[4:26:09] <%afronooch> nah not yet
[4:26:09] <+le_master_of_le_swords> Having put 250+ hours in thos game watching someone else play is so weird who is not has experinced
[4:26:11] <heartlesshealer> or dagger
[4:26:12] <+admiral_of_crunch> Pat doesn't have the crazy poison multiplier card unlocked yet, right? That's a little ways away iirc. Not sure how low-level poison cards will fare against bosses.
[4:26:13] <heartlesshealer> dagger good
[4:26:14] <Darkfire346> I want to train a parrot to just scream NOOT NOOT at people
[4:26:14] <%Bailey__gaming> dagger spray so good
[4:26:18] <+PharosOfLight> he hasn't unlocked catalyst yet
[4:26:19] <LoneFonte> no catalysts yet
[4:26:23] <$RealThiele> LUL its comin
[4:26:23] <Ids560> don't think defect has cata unlocked to start
[4:26:25] <bashful_bard> Catalyst isn't unlocked
[4:26:26] <clockworknait1> anyone else's psn down?
[4:26:27] <Ids560> *silent
[4:26:32] <+tacostarvedbeast> the silent has my big favorite powers and abilities
[4:26:33] <+ghostfaceninja_> @doofmaster, to be fair the idea of deck size and draw odds is kinda unintuitive to a newbie and the game doesn't really warn the player of it at all, so it doesn't click until several runs in for people not used to tcgs
[4:26:36] <%Bailey__gaming> Sip a potion
[4:26:37] <%Keyd00d> Ah I forgot about unlocks
[4:26:39] <whazat> he has just started so a bunch of cards aren't unlocked yet
[4:26:43] <+admiral_of_crunch> Well then he better not put too much stock into poison
[4:26:44] <heartlesshealer> Pat is on a fresh save, so none of the Unlock cards
[4:26:49] <+metalwolfchaos> brok wave if you read this doodFive ChefFrank
[4:26:49] <%Laecerelius> Pet
[4:26:59] <$RealThiele> also neutralize + is so good

[4:27:13] <heartlesshealer> eat your temp potions
[4:27:15] <%Grayhammatter> nicely done poison
[4:27:15] <whazat> only took a little damage, not so scary
[4:27:20] <anAngryHamster> This is still the second run, right?
[4:27:20] <bashful_bard> His poison at this point is sufficient
[4:27:26] <braincraft> Neutralize and Smash are both great candidates for early upgrades.
[4:27:28] <lloyddboy> FUME
[4:27:28] <+PharosOfLight> FUMES!
[4:27:28] <$lotharrio> So might as well drink up a potion each fight if you're at 3, right?
[4:27:29] <heartlesshealer> YES YES YES
[4:27:30] <rasamune> NANI?! *pop*
[4:27:30] <$spardanwarrior> YEAAAAH

[4:27:37] <reonome> YEYEYE
[4:27:37] <braincraft> Noxious Fumes is your main boss-killer.

[4:28:02] <%Laecerelius> Stink 'em up!
[4:28:02] <%thebeargoesHONK> Kill the healer
[4:28:02] <%IRashonal> MURDER THE HEALER
[4:28:03] <LoneFonte> BRAAAAAP
[4:28:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Now you're a melee player Kappa
[4:28:04] <heartlesshealer> but yay poison
[4:28:06] <aeonicvector> poison healer
[4:28:06] <%Keyd00d> I always go knight first
[4:28:09] <braincraft> A lot of the time you can have only noxious fumes and defense, turtle up and win that way.
[4:28:11] <+tacostarvedbeast> that one card plus abunch of defensive stuff can litterally win the game on its own
[4:28:15] <%Visorak6> healer
[4:28:15] <sectorquack> take out the child first
[4:28:16] <+gumballwizard> Silent just ripping ass
[4:28:19] <zenith0111> Don't hit the healer :(
[4:28:25] <+admiral_of_crunch> That's the gross poison, but it needs some sort of catalyst to be really gross
[4:28:25] <LoneFonte> is The Specimen a unlock relic?
[4:28:32] <$RealThiele> fuck the healers
[4:28:33] <+PharosOfLight> if you kill the healer first, the knight engraes
[4:28:38] <rasamune> Silent but deadly hurr hurr hurr
[4:28:44] <bashful_bard> No?
[4:28:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> POTION
[4:28:47] <braincraft> Yeah, all the really good relics are unlocks.
[4:28:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> use one
[4:28:50] <heartlesshealer> eat potion get potion
[4:28:50] <%Keyd00d> rip
[4:28:53] <aeonicvector> focus rest on knight, healer goes down easy to poison
[4:28:53] <FourthQueen> @PatStaresAt you can turn off screen shake if that's a thing you want
[4:28:54] <+tacostarvedbeast> @gumballwizard haha didn't think of that, they should mod the card to just be a picture of taco bell
[4:29:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> that's way better
[4:29:07] <%Keyd00d> nice
[4:29:08] <bashful_bard> Specimen might be an unlock but idk
[4:29:08] <+metalwolfchaos> alright could we talk about Mjolnir yet orrr
[4:29:10] <sectorquack> it is way better
[4:29:13] <heartlesshealer> clap
[4:29:13] <whazat> also 2 strength will be good to chunk this guy down
[4:29:16] <%Grayhammatter> healer should have adjusted
[4:29:18] <+RiceeFTW> good luck
[4:29:27] <sectorquack> discard strike
[4:29:27] <+admiral_of_crunch> Just chug potions, Pat
[4:29:35] <%Keyd00d> oof
[4:29:43] <whazat> with alchemize, chugging is gonna be worth
[4:29:47] <reonome> killing the centurion first is usually better
[4:29:48] <sectorquack> stab
[4:29:48] <heartlesshealer> strength is not dex
[4:29:50] <+The_Protagonist> so much for the knight enraging
[4:29:51] <%kknutson4> no the dex
[4:29:59] <sectorquack> no it was not
[4:30:01] <%ChrisPlaysThing> dex pot would have been better
[4:30:04] <heartlesshealer> oh well
[4:30:04] <%thebeargoesHONK> should have chugged the green potion
[4:30:10] <LoneFonte> now you know
[4:30:13] <%crimsonharvest> how do you like the poison guy
[4:30:13] <sectorquack> dance it up
[4:30:15] <heartlesshealer> win
[4:30:16] <lloyddboy> DED
[4:30:17] <bashful_bard> Don't overthink the speed pot
[4:30:18] <+tacostarvedbeast> how far did it get with ironclad?
[4:30:22] <+PharosOfLight> @The_Protagonist what I meant is he does the x3 attacks only once the healer dies. Kill him first and he never does
[4:30:29] <Cosairen> this character is so much cooler
[4:30:32] <%thebeargoesHONK> oh god.... have fun
[4:30:36] <sectorquack> FUMES

[4:30:40] <+RiceeFTW> i HATE this snake
[4:30:41] <aeonicvector> poison this guy, you need all the free damage you can get
[4:30:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> ironclad is so fun and easy when you learn the trick
[4:30:43] <%kknutson4> Stop taking deflects ya putz
[4:30:44] <%Laecerelius> Right up that snake's ass
[4:30:47] <%afronooch> @tacostarvedbeast little bit further than here
[4:30:48] <%bevyrage> pat already killed this one so it's fine
[4:30:49] <braincraft> Honestly, just cut all the strikes from your deck and go full toxic turtle.
[4:30:50] <+ghostfaceninja_> @tacostarvedbeast, roughly halfway
[4:30:51] <%Keyd00d> oh lord
[4:30:52] <sectorquack> sneko is rough
[4:30:52] <%Visorak6> snecko is TERRIBLE for your character

[4:31:12] <%Keyd00d> holy shit
[4:31:13] <Mr_Strut> Seems legit
[4:31:14] <Doofmaster> @braincraft we'll probably have curses to remove first from key
[4:31:20] <+metalwolfchaos> brok can we skip the kupwtk shit and get back to real shit
[4:31:20] <+RiceeFTW> LMAO
[4:31:20] <bashful_bard> I mean it could be terrible
[4:31:23] <Mrthefro> How many runs in is he?
[4:31:31] <+tacostarvedbeast> dont be afraid to use ur potions for this snek
[4:31:33] <+admiral_of_crunch> The Ironclad is fun once you start basically running a black/red deck with constant self-harm for big gains, but Silent is fun off the bat with a million cards and poison fuckery.
[4:31:36] <LoneFonte> 2nd run
[4:31:37] <%afronooch> this is 2nd
[4:31:38] <Doofmaster> @Mrthefro second run in
[4:31:42] <braincraft> This is his second ever, I think.
[4:31:45] <%Bailey__gaming> 2nd run

[4:49:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ORB
[4:49:57] <sectorquack> use ittttttttt
[4:49:59] <Ids560> the Zapping System at work
[4:50:03] <Jetsfantasy> Defect: Become Orb
[4:50:03] <%Keyd00d> just do orb
[4:50:04] <+ghostfaceninja_> s y s t e m s
[4:50:09] <aeonicvector> it means you have passive slots
[4:50:09] <Gallhint> "got it...what the fuck is this"
[4:50:09] <%linSP> the orb man uses the orb robot
[4:50:10] <whazat> so you have 3 Orb slots, and Orbs do things
[4:50:10] <%Taisuru> When an orb is pushed out it does a thing
[4:50:12] <%Grayhammatter> the zapping system
[4:50:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> end turn
[4:50:15] <$lotharrio> Orb has increased.
[4:50:16] <sectorquack> just pass
[4:50:16] <0rond> use DA ZAPPIGN SYSTEM
[4:50:16] <zenith0111> USE ORB
[4:50:17] <LoneFonte> zapping system huh
[4:50:19] <%Profmcstevie> Do and discover time
[4:50:20] <sectorquack> end the turn
[4:50:22] <%Keyd00d> psaGoblin
[4:50:23] <edward11231> Robot is very technical but fun
[4:50:25] <sectorquack> yes
[4:50:26] <CrimsonFox777> Yes
[4:50:28] <+RiceeFTW> yes
[4:50:28] <ha2ken> It's not a legit win if you don't do orb
[4:50:28] <aeonicvector> YUP
[4:50:29] <+RiceeFTW> lol
[4:50:29] <%DappercatEsquire> yes
[4:50:30] <+CaptainJax> yes
[4:50:34] <aeonicvector> and the 8 is if you overfill
[4:50:34] <sectorquack> doom and gloom
[4:50:35] <heartlesshealer> Play ACN
[4:50:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> POWER OF ORB
[4:50:35] <%Visorak6> cards that EVOKE will cause that effect to happen
[4:50:36] <%Taisuru> They have a pssive and an active effect basically
[4:50:36] <%linSP> it will proc a passive each turn if you dont push them out
[4:50:37] <+gumballwizard> You won already
[4:50:37] <%thebeargoesHONK> streamline
[4:50:38] <%Keyd00d> Defect can get broken as fuck
[4:50:38] <lloyddboy> DDOM
[4:50:38] <sectorquack> DOOM
[4:50:39] <Doofmaster> doom and gloom pog
[4:50:40] <+metalwolfchaos> my favorite FrankerZ FrankerZ
[4:50:42] <%kknutson4> DOOM
[4:50:45] <lloyddboy> MORE ORB
[4:50:46] <%Profmcstevie> Summon ORB
[4:50:47] <+RiceeFTW> love this deck
[4:50:47] <Doofmaster> ok doomer
[4:50:48] <+admiral_of_crunch> It's an assembly line of arrangeable buffs
[4:50:50] <+Walopoh> DOOM AND GLOM
[4:50:51] <0rond> @PatStaresAt passive: at the end of the turn, evoke: when the orb ceases to be for any reason
[4:50:52] <+ghostfaceninja_> NotLikeThis
[4:50:52] <CrimsonFox777> STORM
[4:50:53] <%Brickhaus_> Storm
[4:50:53] <%thebeargoesHONK> STORM
[4:50:54] <aeonicvector> storm
[4:50:55] <+agumon9000> @PatStaresAt All orbs have a passive effect and an evoke effect. Cards can evoke orbs or getting a new orb while all your slots are full will evoke your right most orb
[4:50:55] <sectorquack> storm is mad good
[4:50:55] <lloyddboy> RIP sling
[4:50:56] <tanarath> ORB
[4:50:56] <bashful_bard> Nice
[4:50:58] <sectorquack> also barrage
[4:51:02] <%Taisuru> STORM

[4:51:09] <%Mendin> Ball Lightning
[4:51:10] <%kknutson4> meh

[4:51:11] <sectorquack> storm is absolutely pog
[4:51:11] <0rond> STORM STORM
[4:51:12] <Doofmaster> storm with 0 powers.... you guys
[4:51:12] <heartlesshealer> So reading is the MOST important with Orb robot
[4:51:12] <%Keyd00d> I prefer ice
[4:51:13] <+Walopoh> BECOME THE LIGHTNING
[4:51:15] <emptyantics> Become ORB
[4:51:16] <+MrAtheGreat> I am the storm that's approaching!!!!!!!!!
[4:51:17] <+tacostarvedbeast> the storms coming, can you feel it?
[4:51:17] <0rond> POWER DECK POWER DECK
[4:51:18] <zazzera01> BIG STORMS
[4:51:18] <%linSP> i mean its 1 free lightning a turn
[4:51:19] <%Keyd00d> can't get enough defense
[4:51:20] <tanarath> ORB, Pat
[4:51:20] <%thebeargoesHONK> power card deck is a strat for this guy
[4:51:21] <+RiceeFTW> when you channel max orbs, it auto evokes
[4:51:21] <reonome> storm is good when you start building for it
[4:51:24] <Louie_Salmon> Is storm really that good?
[4:51:24] <sectorquack> do you like ORB
[4:51:25] <%kknutson4> Take cards that are useful now, not later
[4:51:26] <lloyddboy> I AM THE STORM THAT'S APPROOOOOOACHIIIIIIIING
[4:51:26] <anAngryHamster> Storm seems bad
[4:51:26] <aeonicvector> storm is useless rn, but its the poison of robot
[4:51:27] <ha2ken> Storm? The Baz?
[4:51:27] <%afronooch> storm is good if you build for it
[4:51:27] <0rond> now just take all the powers
[4:51:28] <%Broand> power cards are common this character pretty much
[4:51:30] <%Gogogolem> Powwa
[4:51:32] <bashful_bard> Storm is a curse rn
[4:51:33] <LoneFonte> POWER DECK LETS GOOO
[4:51:35] <%Taisuru> STORM IS USELESS RN THO
[4:51:36] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, it does like, nothing right now
[4:51:36] <$spardanwarrior> Does nothing until you get more powers though
[4:51:39] <Landedx> storm gonna be worthless for awhile
[4:51:39] <%Brickhaus_> Acquire more power cards
[4:51:39] <whazat> not good until you get power cards, but this character has a ton
[4:51:39] <+RiceeFTW> @Louie_Salmon power cards really good on defect
[4:51:40] <sectorquack> just punch him
[4:51:42] <Mrthefro> Not with 0 powers cmonBruh
[4:51:43] <+FlyingRamen> start lookin for powers
[4:51:44] <+Walopoh> UNLIMITED POWAH
[4:51:44] <%thebeargoesHONK> get lots of powers
[4:51:46] <sectorquack> BARRAGE
[4:51:46] <%Keyd00d> You need power cards lol
[4:51:47] <+gumballwizard> Unless you get more powers storm is worthless
[4:51:47] <$lotharrio> Need powers, I guess.
[4:51:49] <+metalwolfchaos> feeling more like jesus than god right now man where is the hammer brok
[4:51:50] <heartlesshealer> eh
[4:51:51] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Barrage
[4:51:52] <sectorquack> no barrage
[4:51:52] <%linSP> MORE DOOM
[4:51:54] <%Mendin> Until you learn the gimmicks, focusing on Big Lightning and nothing else gives you minimum added complexity for maximum POWERRRRR
[4:51:54] <tanarath> ORB
[4:51:55] <0rond> boot sequance real good
[4:51:55] <%Gogogolem> yeah yeah
[4:51:57] <sectorquack> damn
[4:51:58] <%Grayhammatter> storm is useless right now, need more power cards
[4:51:59] <0rond> barrage bad
[4:52:00] <LoneFonte> @PatStaresAt useless right now but defect gets a lot of power cards
[4:52:04] <zenith0111> BARRAGE THO
[4:52:05] <%Keyd00d> Barrage plus extra orb slots
[4:52:05] <sectorquack> kill it
[4:52:06] <%Brickhaus_> remove card
[4:52:09] <%bevyrage> pray and remove a strike
[4:52:12] <+agumon9000> Destroy!
[4:52:13] <aeonicvector> Basically, whenever you play a passive, you get an orb, that thing that ususally costs a mana....
[4:52:16] <sectorquack> punch
[4:52:23] <sectorquack> CHILL
[4:52:24] <heartlesshealer> Chill is fun
[4:52:27] <0rond> CAN YOU FEEL THE STORM? IT'S COMING!
[4:52:28] <sectorquack> CHILL!!!!!!!
[4:52:28] <%thebeargoesHONK> orb damage
[4:52:29] <%Keyd00d> Just read
[4:52:30] <whazat> Focus powers your Orbs
[4:52:31] <sectorquack> chill is poggers
[4:52:31] <$RealThiele> zap + all 4 one
[4:52:32] <$spardanwarrior> Focus is orb damage
[4:52:32] <%Gogogolem> chill
[4:52:33] <aeonicvector> just get chill
[4:52:33] <%Brickhaus_> Focus makes orbs better
[4:52:33] <%linSP> i'd ignore focus for now
[4:52:36] <%thebeargoesHONK> focus= orb power
[4:52:36] <heartlesshealer> Focus = ORB STRENGTH
[4:52:37] <+agumon9000> Skip
[4:52:37] <NeutrinoInteraction> He is not the most complex one
[4:52:38] <+RiceeFTW> there's just a lot of terms, not really complex
[4:52:39] <%afronooch> focus is orb power
[4:52:40] <%Gogogolem> Boss
[4:52:43] <heartlesshealer> MUST READ FOR ROBOT
[4:52:44] <%Taisuru> READ YOU BIG BABY
[4:52:44] <%TheWinged7> jsut do it paaaaatuuh
[4:52:44] <%DappercatEsquire> LEARN THE LORE PAT
[4:52:44] <ha2ken> No do it tho
[4:52:46] <%kknutson4> Oh boy just wait till you get the 4th character
[4:52:46] <%Keyd00d> Sir
[4:52:46] <0rond> focus is like str and dex but for your orbs
[4:52:46] <LoneFonte> Each character is more complex
[4:52:47] <+tacostarvedbeast> ur gonna read with this boi
[4:52:47] <bashful_bard> Reprogram is bad
[4:52:47] <%linSP> reee
[4:52:48] <%Typhaeon> NERDS
[4:52:49] <aeonicvector> reading is for nerds
[4:52:49] <whazat> video games are for playing not for reading
[4:52:49] <sectorquack> focus buffs all your orbs
[4:52:49] <$lotharrio> Pat doesn't play games for reading!
[4:52:49] <Cosairen> pat you are playing a card gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
[4:52:49] <+GrandmasterBFunk> you just gotta understand da orbz
[4:52:50] <%Grayhammatter> focus is orb power
[4:52:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reading is for nerds
[4:52:51] <tanarath> A GAMER
[4:52:52] <%Brickhaus_> Focus makes your balls bigger
[4:52:56] <Vermillion129> see if you can read this "fuck you pat"
[4:52:57] <Goergorion> Blunder powers!
[4:52:57] <0rond> @PatStaresAt focus is like str and dex but for your orbs
[4:52:59] <ha2ken> Just REE
[4:53:01] <+Lord0Mugen> READ BITCH! READ!!
[4:53:01] <sectorquack> doom and block
[4:53:04] <+metalwolfchaos> thor without Mjolnir ls like donald trunp without a billion dollars
[4:53:05] <%Keyd00d> It's exactly what it says
[4:53:06] <%IRashonal> @PatStaresAt Focus means your orbs have an increased passive effect
[4:53:06] <+tacostarvedbeast> meaning the 2 cost
[4:53:07] <+Walopoh> Pat and Paige have silverware: Confirmed
[4:53:07] <%twoto858> Imagine reading in a card game
[4:53:07] <+RiceeFTW> do BIGF DAMAGE
[4:53:08] <+MrAtheGreat> works with doom and gloom
[4:53:08] <%DappercatEsquire> next is whatever is furthest to the right
[4:53:08] <Landedx> lol Pat gonna have fun learning the 4th character then
[4:53:10] <aeonicvector> so lose the passive, gain 16 dmaage rn
[4:53:13] <%linSP> evoke then doom
[4:53:13] <0rond> "next" is the right most one
[4:53:13] <+MrAtheGreat> I would bet
[4:53:13] <%thebeargoesHONK> will do 16 damage but then no passive damage at end of turn
[4:53:14] <%Typhaeon> Come on Pat, you are the Orb Master, you got this
[4:53:15] <Mr_Strut> The slorb hungers
[4:53:15] <+agumon9000> Dualcast Doom and Gloom
[4:53:16] <zenith0111> Dualcast PogChamp
[4:53:18] <lloyddboy> DARK
[4:53:21] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Mong.
[4:53:21] <%Taisuru> DOOMAND BLOCK
[4:53:25] <sectorquack> dualcast doom
[4:53:25] <%Keyd00d> Read the rest
[4:53:33] <reonome> just see what happens pat
[4:53:34] <emptyantics> DOOM AND GLOOM
[4:53:34] <sectorquack> do it
[4:53:35] <+GrandmasterBFunk> I think the 4th character is easier to understand than Defect, they just have stances
[4:53:37] <aeonicvector> doom and gloom and strike
[4:53:38] <%thebeargoesHONK> strike
[4:53:39] <lloyddboy> DUAL
[4:53:42] <+RiceeFTW> evokes lightning twice
[4:53:44] <whazat> you'll figure it out
[4:53:48] <0rond> dual cast
[4:53:48] <+RiceeFTW> 16 damage
[4:53:49] <tanarath> Yes
[4:53:50] <sectorquack> it triggers the lightning twice
[4:53:58] <aeonicvector> so yeah, "front" passive gets spent when you evoke
[4:53:58] <anAngryHamster> If I hear one more word about Norse mythology I'll bend over and eat my own ass
[4:53:59] <reonome> chill
[4:54:02] <0rond> don't chill
[4:54:04] <sectorquack> chill is just free real estate
[4:54:05] <$lotharrio> Get that ice
[4:54:08] <Goergorion> free chill
[4:54:09] <rasamune> So the problem with Defect against this boss is uh, all your best cards are skills
[4:54:09] <lloyddboy> DOOM
[4:54:11] <%Grayhammatter> do not chill
[4:54:12] <+RiceeFTW> you can do doom + zap + chill
[4:54:13] <%Keyd00d> the blue number is how much damage it will do when evoked
[4:54:13] <Manwad> never have chill
[4:54:15] <0rond> chill will make him stronger
[4:54:15] <Louie_Salmon> Skills
[4:54:16] <0rond> NOOO
[4:54:16] <+RiceeFTW> oh
[4:54:17] <%linSP> orbs are FIFO not LIFO
[4:54:18] <$spardanwarrior> Dark will gain 6 damage each turn, when you pop it it deals the blue number in damage
[4:54:18] <%Keyd00d> 2
[4:54:19] <%thebeargoesHONK> frost = 2 armor per orb
[4:54:21] <%Brickhaus_> Red Boi is a DPS race, playing skills pisses him off
[4:54:23] <%TheWinged7> you build up spells in thoes orb slots, evoke casts right most orb
[4:54:25] <%BoxNavy> monkaS paige?
[4:54:26] <%linSP> oh god
[4:54:26] <+GrandmasterBFunk> how much orb does it block
[4:54:28] <%Grayhammatter> paige? monkaS
[4:54:33] <reonome> PAT READ
[4:54:36] <sectorquack> bc you only have 2 and no focus
[4:54:36] <%bevyrage> chill only gives 2 block
[4:54:36] <+RiceeFTW> when you evoke it you get more
[4:54:36] <%thebeargoesHONK> dark will build power per turn.
[4:54:37] <%linSP> its 2 block passive
[4:54:40] <+tacostarvedbeast> passive block, if only u could have more orbs that 3
[4:54:41] <Manwad> there's cards that allow orb to scale
[4:54:43] <%DappercatEsquire> you gotta build for chill
[4:54:43] <heartlesshealer> Frost is better when you evoke them
[4:54:43] <%Keyd00d> it says 2
[4:54:47] <heartlesshealer> or have lots
[4:54:50] <+GrandmasterBFunk> The number on the orb tells you what it's giving you
[4:54:51] <Doofmaster> that nob is getting pissed lol
[4:54:54] <+RiceeFTW> and focus increases effectiveness of your orbs
[4:54:54] <heartlesshealer> Rightmost
[4:54:54] <%bevyrage> first orb is right orb
[4:54:56] <+gumballwizard> Gotta get focus
[4:54:56] <%Keyd00d> First slot is the right one
[4:54:56] <sectorquack> doom
[4:54:56] <$RealThiele> oof
[4:54:57] <LoneFonte> right is first
[4:54:57] <aeonicvector> Front slot ir first
[4:54:57] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt first slot is the ight most
[4:54:59] <braincraft> Frost can be really strong with Focus.
[4:55:00] <tanarath> RIGHT ORB FIRST
[4:55:00] <%BoxNavy> he has 14 sword monkaS
[4:55:00] <whazat> right most is the first
[4:55:01] <%IRashonal> right most orb is the one that'll go Pat
[4:55:01] <%SwdVengeance> Pat's having a moment isn't he?
[4:55:02] <+skm742> 'first' slot is the orb closest to enemy
[4:55:05] <sectorquack> manga rules bitch
[4:55:09] <Vermillion129> Pat is getting confuse LUL
[4:55:09] <+FlyingRamen> first slot is the rightmost
[4:55:10] <%linSP> this guy gets stronger eveytime you do a skill
[4:55:10] <%Grayhammatter> the first orb is the rightmost orb
[4:55:13] <whazat> it goes from right to left
[4:55:14] <+admiral_of_crunch> Clearly we need more orb
[4:55:15] <+metalwolfchaos> brok so what do i have to do to get this hammer make super hurricane
[4:55:16] <sectorquack> The gg

[4:55:37] <heartlesshealer> Pat will learn Orb eventually
[4:55:39] <Cosairen> why does it feel like pat is like i dont understand when he is refusing to read again
[4:55:41] <%Keyd00d> Blizzard is amazing in some builds
[4:55:42] <$spardanwarrior> Need big brain for robot
[4:55:45] <whazat> big doom and gloom deck
[4:55:46] <%thebeargoesHONK> Frost gives you 2 armor per orb at end of turn lightning does damage to random enemy at end of turn Dark will build up power per turn, when envoked it will do all the built up damage
[4:55:48] <reonome> dualcast + dark orb is good
[4:55:50] <Louie_Salmon> Okay that's a little too much Doom and gloom
[4:55:51] <braincraft> Too much Dark channel is self-defeating.
[4:55:55] <sectorquack> please READ
[4:55:55] <bashful_bard> Oh good doom can be our new strike
[4:55:57] <+admiral_of_crunch> If we stack enough powers and orbs on top of one another, we can automate the entire deck
[4:55:58] <%TheWinged7> we found another of pats shadow puzzles
[4:55:59] <heartlesshealer> Robot takes a few runs to get used to
[4:56:01] <+Lord0Mugen> the lightning skill first PAT!
[4:56:01] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Running a frost deck with an artifact that carries over block is how i beat the game the first time
[4:56:05] <Jetsfantasy> Dark does huge damage when you "use" it up based on how long you hold onto it
[4:56:07] <%the1truefaraldo> This game is actually kinda hard
[4:56:13] <%Keyd00d> ?
[4:56:13] <%linSP> yeah but
[4:56:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> Defect takes some adjusting since he's so different
[4:56:14] <0rond> you don't want to rotate dark ones, you want to focus on 1
[4:56:14] <emptyantics> JUST READ YOU BIG BABY
[4:56:17] <zenith0111> MORE ORB
[4:56:20] <heartlesshealer> Orb Strong, but Orb Strategy
[4:56:22] <Louie_Salmon> This is what I was hoping for with this stream
[4:56:23] <%Brickhaus_> Boondocks flashbacks: "Read, Goblin, Read!"
[4:56:28] <%linSP> lighting hits randomly
[4:56:32] <Mr_Strut> Read, dummy
[4:56:35] <0rond> @PatStaresAt don't worry defect is complicated
[4:56:38] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat, which part is confusing you?
[4:56:39] <+Lord0Mugen> @Brickhaus_ YES!!
[4:56:41] <+TheCoobie> When they are channeled, they give passive abilities. When evoked, they give bigger bangs
[4:56:46] <Louie_Salmon> Just a couple hours of "Who... what? what does that do? what is that?"
[4:56:49] <sectorquack> wait till you see plasma
[4:56:51] <whazat> Orb does Passive each turn, Evoke gets rid of Orb for big effect
[4:56:51] <%Keyd00d> Dark will do the blue number of damage when evoked
[4:56:54] <reonome> YOU DON"T
[4:56:54] <%Brickhaus_> You dont
[4:56:55] <heartlesshealer> NEVER CHOOSE ORB
[4:56:56] <Landedx> basic gameplay is happening Pat: "What?"
[4:56:56] <+Lord0Mugen> @Brickhaus_ We having an Uncle Ruckus moment
[4:56:56] <Louie_Salmon> Rightmost
[4:56:57] <+GrandmasterBFunk> it's the rightmost one
[4:56:57] <sectorquack> you dont they all go off
[4:56:58] <%Keyd00d> The rightmost gets pushed out first
[4:56:58] <anAngryHamster> Words can convey useful information
[4:56:59] <+nictron90> It's the rightmost one
[4:56:59] <+RiceeFTW> it's whichever is in "front"
[4:56:59] <%linSP> its FIFO
[4:56:59] <%afronooch> you dont
[4:57:00] <+MrAtheGreat> it shoots thne foremost orb
[4:57:00] <whazat> right most
[4:57:00] <%Grayhammatter> you don't
[4:57:01] <0rond> you don't
[4:57:01] <$RealThiele> PLA HEE MA
[4:57:01] <+tacostarvedbeast> they all proc passively
[4:57:03] <aeonicvector> you dont, its always the one furthest right
[4:57:04] <purplelemons> rightmost orb evokes first
[4:57:04] <%thebeargoesHONK> orb furthest to the right will always go first
[4:57:05] <$spardanwarrior> Rightmost orb is the one that fires
[4:57:05] <%kknutson4> The one on the right is always first to evoke
[4:57:05] <TheoTTree> The one on the furthest right will be fired off
[4:57:05] <zazzera01> THE RIGHTMOST IT SAYS IT
[4:57:05] <Doofmaster> orbs go in the left and get pushed out the right, it's a queue
[4:57:06] <Explodincatz> u dont choose
[4:57:09] <+metalwolfchaos> brok please bro BibleThump
[4:57:09] <+FlyingRamen> its always the rightmost
[4:57:10] <+CaptainJax> the one on the right gets pushed out and fired
[4:57:11] <%the1truefaraldo> The right most
[4:57:11] <+RiceeFTW> the "front" is the one closest to enemy
[4:57:12] <%Keyd00d> RIGHT WOOLIE
[4:57:12] <lloyddboy> pushing out the right orb evokes
[4:57:13] <aeonicvector> that one
[4:57:14] <%Cn_alpha_02> Rightmost
[4:57:14] <SailingSaturn> its like Nero's Devil Breakers
[4:57:15] <braincraft> They cycle clockwise. New orbs push the old ones forward.
[4:57:15] <%Brickhaus_> @Lord0Mugen Gonna have to take off my belt in a minute
[4:57:16] <%afronooch> "front" is closest to the enemies
[4:57:16] <+tacostarvedbeast> envoking is the right most orb
[4:57:17] <Louie_Salmon> It's a conveyor belt
[4:57:17] <tanarath> You don't, you cast in the order you want them to fire.
[4:57:17] <+TheCoobie> you dont, the one closest to enemy will be evoked when you gain a fourth orb
[4:57:17] <heartlesshealer> FRONT ORB EVOKE FIRST
[4:57:17] <+PaladinDupre> PaladinDupre subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! Now that CK3 is out and the tutorial is reportedly really good and intuitive for newcomers, would you consider some Crusader Kings?
[4:57:18] <%Broand> All orbs fire off, but the orb on the right will always be consumed when something gets consumed
[4:57:19] <Giztech> works like a clock
[4:57:19] <+skm742> when orb gets 'evoked', the one at the front gets fired.
[4:57:19] <%arancet> the oldest one, on the right, goes first
[4:57:20] <%linSP> yes
[4:57:20] <+MrAtheGreat> you get 5 block
[4:57:21] <purplelemons> they're slots, they push each other forward
[4:57:21] <sectorquack> when a new orb comes in the farthest right evokes
[4:57:22] <LoneFonte> all passives trigger at round end, evoke uses the rightmost orb @PatStaresAt
[4:57:22] <reonome> NO
[4:57:23] <Jetsfantasy> You don't, it's a set order of oldest to newest (right is oldest, left newest)
[4:57:24] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis
[4:57:24] <+Walopoh> Think of it like the next bullets in the chamber
[4:57:24] <whazat> imagine a backwards clock
[4:57:25] <%Keyd00d> yes
[4:57:25] <TheoTTree> the frost one would evoke
[4:57:26] <$spardanwarrior> ice orb pops
[4:57:26] <reonome> YES
[4:57:27] <+nictron90> Yep
[4:57:27] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Yes
[4:57:28] <%goose_attack_almanac> It cycles. Right-most orb is the one that gets channeled. and then the rest move forward
[4:57:28] <+tacostarvedbeast> si
[4:57:28] <lloyddboy> nope
[4:57:29] <TheoTTree> giving you armour
[4:57:29] <%thebeargoesHONK> YES
[4:57:29] <+MrAtheGreat> yes
[4:57:29] <heartlesshealer> Conveyor belt
[4:57:30] <sectorquack> yes
[4:57:30] <+RiceeFTW> yes
[4:57:30] <%kknutson4> Yea
[4:57:30] <%Broand> Yes
[4:57:31] <+CaptainJax> ye
[4:57:32] <Doofmaster> yes!
[4:57:32] <tanarath> Correct
[4:57:33] <%Bailey__gaming> yes
[4:57:34] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt they all will power go off the same turn, with differing effects, but what you just said was right
[4:57:34] <aeonicvector> you will EVOKE ice, dark goes mid, ice goes to right
[4:57:36] <%Mendin> Every orb fires off at the end of your turn. When you Invoke (burn) an orb, the rightmost orb goes away
[4:57:37] <Explodincatz> correct
[4:57:37] <%afronooch> shifts towards the enemies yes
[4:57:38] <0rond> @PatStaresAt to be fair, it doesn't say, "next orb" is rightmost one
[4:57:39] <Landedx> yay learning
[4:57:39] <+FlyingRamen> yew
[4:57:42] <+stuffstuffwhatever> Yeah, it goes clockwise
[4:57:42] <+tacostarvedbeast> get 5 armor
[4:57:43] <heartlesshealer> Orb is just Conveyor Belts
[4:57:45] <Louie_Salmon> Conveyor belt is the best way to understand it
[4:57:45] <sectorquack> give you armor
[4:57:46] <%Broand> and then get 5 block yes
[4:57:47] <+RiceeFTW> then it would evoke the frost
[4:57:49] <M4eta> STORM
[4:57:49] <whazat> when new orbs come in, the old orb gets Evoked
[4:57:49] <%Keyd00d> you're doo-ing it
[4:57:50] <braincraft> Exactly. Pat, you play MMORPGs, this isn't more complicated than a raid boss.
[4:57:53] <+gumballwizard> Yeah the orbs work clockwise
[4:57:55] <reonome> HE'S GETTING IT
[4:57:56] <sectorquack> yes
[4:58:00] <Jetsfantasy> 7 damage and evoke the ice for 5 block
[4:58:04] <heartlesshealer> yes
[4:58:04] <%linSP> this robot is big brain
[4:58:09] <Giztech> storm first!
[4:58:09] <%DappercatEsquire> by god i think he's got it
[4:58:11] <%Keyd00d> Trust us he's really fun when you get it
[4:58:12] <+PharosOfLight> Dark orbs are like a bomb that build up as you charge them
[4:58:15] <sectorquack> theyll get huge
[4:58:15] <+GrandmasterBFunk> they do big number
[4:58:18] <+nictron90> Yeyeye
[4:58:18] <reonome> YES
[4:58:18] <%Keyd00d> Yep
[4:58:18] <aeonicvector> they do big damage yeah
[4:58:19] <%thebeargoesHONK> YES
[4:58:23] <+RiceeFTW> yes
[4:58:26] <sectorquack> you have to evoke them tho
[4:58:26] <heartlesshealer> Yes
[4:58:27] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah, you've pretty much got it
[4:58:28] <%Keyd00d> oh that hurt
[4:58:29] <%Grayhammatter> yes, but you will need to evoke them
[4:58:31] <%linSP> the dark adds 6 each turn
[4:58:32] <whazat> Lightning Orbs do damage, Dark Orbs store high damage, Ice Orbs do block
[4:58:33] <+nictron90> Dark orbs are great with doublecast
[4:58:34] <braincraft> Probably should have killed the sharky guy, though.
[4:58:34] <zenith0111> USE ORB
[4:58:35] <Doofmaster> killing the jaw worm that turn was better than blocking
[4:58:40] <Jetsfantasy> Yes, but you should evoke them ASAP with such low hp enemies
[4:58:45] <heartlesshealer> PrideFlower PrideFlower PrideFlower PrideFlower
[4:58:47] <+tacostarvedbeast> dark gets tricky, good for bosses but u need more survivability to make it work, his 0 cost cards come in handy for that.
[4:58:47] <+GrandmasterBFunk> abandon run is what you want
[4:58:48] <0rond> @PatStaresAt don't forget dark ones always target the weakest enemy, be careful not to waste them
[4:58:49] <%Keyd00d> mulligan
[4:58:52] <%thebeargoesHONK> FAIR
[4:58:54] <sectorquack> good plan
[4:58:54] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that's fair
[4:58:54] <heartlesshealer> Fair
[4:58:57] <%DappercatEsquire> you can evoke by summoning more orbs than you can hold, or any card that specifically evokes
[4:58:57] <%linSP> yeah
[4:58:58] <+DGenerator> if you die, you get XP
[4:58:59] <%Keyd00d> That's fair
[4:58:59] <reonome> thats fair
[4:59:00] <+FlyingRamen> this is a learning run anyway, so feel free to dick about
[4:59:00] <%Grayhammatter> fair
[4:59:01] <TheoTTree> lmao defect is pretty complex
[4:59:03] <bashful_bard> Fair
[4:59:03] <LoneFonte> no prob
[4:59:04] <whazat> good idea for sure
[4:59:04] <+metalwolfchaos> whatever you want brok
[4:59:04] <%afronooch> yeah, defect is a lot to take in once
[4:59:05] <$RealThiele> coward out
[4:59:05] <+skm742> yeah, robot is weird
[4:59:07] <aeonicvector> @PatStaresAt and the storm thing is just "when you play a power, add a lighting orb"
[4:59:08] <%goose_attack_almanac> Yeah Defect is quite different
[4:59:09] <%Keyd00d> Whale gives you shit though
[4:59:09] <$lotharrio> Just start with the bonus HP?
[4:59:11] <%BoxNavy> Fair
[4:59:14] <%BoxNavy> fair
[4:59:14] <whazat> you could get a freebie on that one
[4:59:15] <$RealThiele> ooh 1 hp
[4:59:16] <%BoxNavy> Fair
[4:59:17] <reonome> AW SHIT
[4:59:17] <%linSP> take the 2nd path to the elite for a free elite
[4:59:18] <$spardanwarrior> It's all good. Defect is strange.
[4:59:18] <Jetsfantasy> Basically pick an element with him until you're comfortable
[4:59:19] <reonome> ELITE SNIPE
[4:59:25] <LoneFonte> @BoxNavy fair
[4:59:27] <+RiceeFTW> there are cards that increase focus which increases effectiveness of your orbs
[4:59:31] <%Grayhammatter> elite snipe possibly
[4:59:33] <$spardanwarrior> 4th character is even stranger
[4:59:33] <%kknutson4> 2nd row imo
[4:59:35] <heartlesshealer> Pray to RNGesus
[4:59:35] <Doofmaster> left through the shop and fire is the most likely
[4:59:35] <Kadraxan> defect protip: FOCUS IS VERY VERY GOOD
[4:59:35] <$RealThiele> ooh he can elite snipe
[4:59:36] <sectorquack> slipe that ma n
[4:59:45] <%linSP> the ? rooms COULD be fights tho
[4:59:46] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[4:59:47] <sectorquack> strike me
[4:59:49] <aeonicvector> Defect is imop the hardest of the 4 characters
[4:59:49] <sectorquack> em
[4:59:50] <%Mendin> Pat if you want to get settled, focus on near-pure Lightning just so you juggle orbs around before messing with too m uch micromanagement
[4:59:52] <+tacostarvedbeast> focus great for a thunder god build
[4:59:55] <Doofmaster> this is approx a coinflip
[4:59:56] <%Brickhaus_> Frost decks are fun too
[4:59:56] <sectorquack> blizzard
[5:00:01] <0rond> @PatStaresAt don't forget dark orbs don't target randomly, they always target the weakest enemy, be careful not to waste them
[5:00:01] <aeonicvector> hologram is good
[5:00:04] <lloyddboy> MORB
[5:00:07] <%Keyd00d> you might not have the cards unlocked for it but you can basically get infinite defense loops
[5:00:08] <%BoxNavy> morb damage
[5:00:11] <+tacostarvedbeast> wait hologram is great
[5:00:13] <%Ranryu692> how much damage does your orb do, Pat
[5:00:14] <ha2ken> Become Orb Lord
[5:00:16] <tanarath> MORB
[5:00:16] <+RiceeFTW> bullseye with dark orb is a NUKE
[5:00:19] <%linSP> morebo
[5:00:19] <$RealThiele> blizzard <3
[5:00:21] <%Brickhaus_> Remove strike
[5:00:21] <+Lord0Mugen> Bullseye is for Lightning damage
[5:00:23] <%thebeargoesHONK> remove card
[5:00:25] <%DappercatEsquire> get rid of them strikes
[5:00:25] <$lotharrio> So lightning is passive damage, Frost is tanking, Dark is nuke?
[5:00:27] <%Arrotal> Arrotal subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[5:00:28] <whazat> remove a strike
[5:00:29] <aeonicvector> remove a strike
[5:00:29] <Cosairen> sizzlin
[5:00:32] <%Keyd00d> strike
[5:00:32] <$RealThiele> pure
[5:00:33] <lloyddboy> strike
[5:00:33] <sectorquack> get rid of a strike
[5:00:34] <zenith0111> Hologram has its uses
[5:00:34] <heartlesshealer> Yeah Dark orbs always eat less healthy enemies
[5:00:35] <%BoxNavy> yea
[5:00:35] <%DappercatEsquire> yes
[5:00:35] <%linSP> strike
[5:00:36] <%thebeargoesHONK> or defend
[5:00:37] <%Visorak6> remove strike
[5:00:37] <+RiceeFTW> strike
[5:00:38] <$spardanwarrior> WHy not
[5:00:38] <Louie_Salmon> Strikes are usually correct
[5:00:41] <+metalwolfchaos> I know you see me brok
[5:00:43] <%thebeargoesHONK> BOX
[5:00:45] <%Brickhaus_> Relics are fun

[5:02:12] <%bevyrage> recursion for sure
[5:02:15] <sectorquack> YES
[5:02:15] <braincraft> Recursion cycles your orbs. It puts the oldest one back to the start.
[5:02:16] <0rond> @PatStaresAt recursion is good with dark orbs
[5:02:16] <$lotharrio> Recursion seems good.
[5:02:16] <+RiceeFTW> really good with dark orbs
[5:02:16] <bashful_bard> Eh
[5:02:19] <zenith0111> ORB
[5:02:21] <%Brickhaus_> You can rest and upgrade
[5:02:22] <+PharosOfLight> upgrade your zap
[5:02:23] <$RealThiele> on dark orbs its baller
[5:02:23] <$lotharrio> Upgrade card
[5:02:25] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Upgrade recursion at rest point
[5:02:25] <%bevyrage> bonfire and upgrade?
[5:02:26] <$lotharrio> I think
[5:02:26] <+gumballwizard> Yeah
[5:02:26] <zenith0111> ALL FOR THE ORBS
[5:02:26] <lloyddboy> Chat, does recursion keep dark stacks? I forget
[5:02:26] <%goose_attack_almanac> So that particular Elite wakes u after you deal damage through their Armour, or wait three turns
[5:02:27] <TheoTTree> The best part is it maintains the value on Dark Orbs it evokes
[5:02:27] <+Lord0Mugen> UNKNOWN
[5:02:28] <+Majiinbooh> recursion upgrades to cost 0
[5:02:29] <+DGenerator> recursion is great. recursion is great. recursion is gr-
[5:02:29] <+nictron90> Hidden interaction with recursion: if you recur a dark orb it keeps its number (or used to at least not played in a bit)
[5:02:29] <sectorquack> rest
[5:02:29] <heartlesshealer> check your smithy =)
[5:02:29] <+admiral_of_crunch> Orb boy with a million recursive infinitely-looping powers is fucking transcendent.
[5:02:30] <+tacostarvedbeast> yall still sleeping on these 0 cost cards SMH
[5:02:31] <+metalwolfchaos> the resurrection
[5:02:35] <aeonicvector> hello
[5:02:35] <Doofmaster> recursion is meh right now
[5:02:35] <0rond> upgrade dualcast/zap
[5:02:35] <reonome> RECURSION
[5:02:36] <+PharosOfLight> upgrade zap
[5:02:36] <%thebeargoesHONK> ZAP or world
[5:02:37] <%Grayhammatter> recursion
[5:02:37] <%Keyd00d> I usually do dualcast
[5:02:37] <+RiceeFTW> YES\
[5:02:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> zap
[5:02:40] <+RiceeFTW> FOR FREE
[5:02:41] <%Keyd00d> or anything that turns to 0
[5:02:41] <aeonicvector> check hello worlds
[5:02:43] <Mrthefro> Cold snap imo
[5:02:44] <+MrAtheGreat> 0 again
[5:02:44] <$RealThiele> everything
[5:02:45] <sectorquack> yes
[5:02:46] <%Kinoskae> Zap
[5:02:47] <LoneFonte> free orb huh
[5:02:48] <+Lord0Mugen> hello Wordl
[5:02:48] <zenith0111> YES
[5:02:48] <TheoTTree> Zap is a great upgrade
[5:02:49] <whazat> zap also gets zero cost, and dualcast also gets zero cost
[5:02:50] <sectorquack> free recurs
[5:02:50] <TheoTTree> so is dualcast
[5:02:50] <+MrAtheGreat> nothing
[5:02:51] <heartlesshealer> Check all
[5:02:51] <chocobodundee> zap
[5:02:52] <+gumballwizard> Upgrade is always top priority
[5:02:53] <+Lord0Mugen> YES
[5:02:54] <aeonicvector> always have it
[5:02:56] <Jetsfantasy> Zap is really good starter upgrade
[5:02:57] <$RealThiele> zap is hella good ++
[5:02:57] <aeonicvector> YUP
[5:02:59] <+RiceeFTW> zap prob better here, or dualcast
[5:03:01] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Recursion is the good one
[5:03:04] <%bevyrage> zap, recursion
[5:03:04] <$lotharrio> Dual and Bullseye?
[5:03:04] <whazat> upgrading is always worth it
[5:03:06] <%Keyd00d> recursion
[5:03:06] <chocobodundee> Free is 1000x times better than 1
[5:03:06] <Doofmaster> upgrade is a good one
[5:03:08] <sectorquack> recursion
[5:03:09] <Doofmaster> err
[5:03:09] <aeonicvector> honestly any of those 3
[5:03:09] <0rond> I like dualcast over zap tbh
[5:03:13] <%Grayhammatter> zap, recursion, or dualcast
[5:03:14] <sectorquack> NO
[5:03:20] <zenith0111> Dualcast!!!
[5:03:22] <+RiceeFTW> if you find cards with focus, USE THEM
[5:03:27] <heartlesshealer> Zap makes it free orb, so it's fine
[5:03:27] <+Lord0Mugen> hello World
[5:03:32] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[5:03:34] <Teyaric> Hey, Pat, you noticed how you keep saying THEYRE REALLY GOOD? Masterworks all, you almost can't go wrong!
[5:03:36] <+admiral_of_crunch> I'd throw it on Zap. Free damage now
[5:03:39] <+MrAtheGreat> hello
[5:03:40] <bashful_bard> Not when everything in your deck costs 1
[5:03:46] <+RiceeFTW> no no no
[5:03:50] <+CaptainJax> strike
[5:03:53] <+RiceeFTW> yessss
[5:03:56] <aeonicvector> yes
[5:03:56] <%BoxNavy> no
[5:03:58] <+MrAtheGreat> yeyey now we learning
[5:03:59] <+RiceeFTW> why
[5:04:00] <%DappercatEsquire> rucky
[5:04:00] <%Keyd00d> nice lightning
[5:04:04] <0rond> good play pat
[5:04:07] <whazat> when you've only got one orb, dualcast is a little rough
[5:04:09] <%logoth_> Wow pat's still up. This game must be good
[5:04:13] <+MrAtheGreat> yeyeyey
[5:04:15] <lloyddboy> KILL
[5:04:16] <+MrAtheGreat> good plays
[5:04:18] <+metalwolfchaos> enough of the witch stuff we back on that legendary shit brok
[5:04:21] <%thebeargoesHONK> strike strike
[5:04:24] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Just smack em
[5:04:25] <aeonicvector> 2 strikes
[5:04:25] <$spardanwarrior> Strikes will kill
[5:04:28] <%Keyd00d> could have killed
[5:04:28] <0rond> he had the small one focused, dual cast would have wated 5 damage on it
[5:04:28] <$RealThiele> keeel topsy keeel
[5:04:28] <aeonicvector> nvm
[5:04:28] <lloyddboy> PAT
[5:04:28] <+GrandmasterBFunk> You got lethal
[5:04:29] <+Quack_of_Dawn> They're vulnerable
[5:04:32] <Doofmaster> missed lethal yo
[5:04:38] <whazat> strikes do 50% more with vulnerable, could have killed
[5:04:39] <%Brickhaus_> I'm a fake fan, how late does Pat usually go?
[5:04:40] <+MrAtheGreat> ZAP
[5:04:47] <sectorquack> recurs
[5:04:48] <bashful_bard> Missed lethal
[5:04:48] <+MrAtheGreat> ded
[5:04:50] <aeonicvector> dont forget, zaps apply like poison, you can kill ahead of their turn
[5:04:57] <zenith0111> ORB
[5:04:57] <Doofmaster> it was lethal even without vuln, 6+6+3 =15
[5:05:00] <+MrAtheGreat> ooooooo
[5:05:00] <heartlesshealer> Self Repair is nice
[5:05:01] <reonome> UR DOIN IT
[5:05:02] <sectorquack> barrage
[5:05:03] <%Keyd00d> Barrage
[5:05:05] <sectorquack> BARRAGE
[5:05:07] <aeonicvector> any of those tbqh
[5:05:07] <tanarath> Orb
[5:05:08] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Pay attention to the numbers on your carps when you highlight an enemy, it will calculate the current damage it does
[5:05:09] <%DappercatEsquire> effect trigger order gets kinda important
[5:05:09] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Yeah self-repair is good
[5:05:11] <+tacostarvedbeast> self repair isn't bad, but its lack luster
[5:05:13] <bashful_bard> These are all great
[5:05:15] <0rond> c o n s u m e
[5:05:16] <whazat> consume is good when you start getting cards that add orb slots
[5:05:16] <$lotharrio> Full potions.
[5:05:16] <$RealThiele> c o n s u m e
[5:05:17] <+admiral_of_crunch> Paige somersaulting offscreen
[5:05:17] <heartlesshealer> Consume is for High Cycling
[5:05:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> it depends
[5:05:19] <%SWFanatic> berserker barrage?
[5:05:22] <lloyddboy> synergizes with slot gain
[5:05:22] <sectorquack> take the fireplace
[5:05:23] <+PharosOfLight> consume is very good with a specific relic
[5:05:24] <%bevyrage> losing an orb slot means you evoke faster
[5:05:25] <%Keyd00d> It's good when you get things that give free orb slots
[5:05:25] <%afronooch> theres a synergy with consume but i dont think you have the other half for it
[5:05:26] <whazat> consume also allows high cycling, yeah
[5:05:27] <%kknutson4> Less slots means more evoking tho
[5:05:28] <%thebeargoesHONK> destory orb slot is good if you get the relic that gives you more orbs every couple turns
[5:05:32] <+MrAtheGreat> oOOOO
[5:05:32] <LoneFonte> consume needs some prep
[5:05:33] <$RealThiele> consume means you evoke spam
[5:05:34] <zenith0111> ELITE
[5:05:35] <+tacostarvedbeast> meh
[5:05:43] <+admiral_of_crunch> Good potentially
[5:05:45] <+MrAtheGreat> All of these relics are good
[5:05:45] <+metalwolfchaos> brok call sindri back up we need the gang back on it
[5:05:50] <Giztech> be sure to check the cards numbers as they change when seleeting it in combat depending on status affect
[5:05:55] <heartlesshealer> recursion or dualcast
[5:06:00] <$RealThiele> dual is smexy
[5:06:00] <aeonicvector> recursion or world
[5:06:01] <sectorquack> yes
[5:06:02] <whazat> recursion being free is great
[5:06:02] <%Brickhaus_> 0 is always nice
[5:06:03] <%bevyrage> def
[5:06:04] <bashful_bard> Barrage upgrade is really strong
[5:06:05] <+Quack_of_Dawn> It's free damage
[5:06:06] <sectorquack> absolutely
[5:06:09] <%Grayhammatter> recursion or dualcast
[5:06:09] <+admiral_of_crunch> Hell yeah, now you can forge with impunity
[5:06:10] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Yeah 0 cost recursion is really good
[5:06:11] <zenith0111> Dualcast!
[5:06:13] <$RealThiele> free spells are OP
[5:06:16] <%Keyd00d> I almost always go for 0
[5:06:27] <ha2ken> It's basically free
[5:06:32] <+admiral_of_crunch> Free spells are free spells
[5:06:32] <sectorquack> defend defend
[5:06:38] <heartlesshealer> tea set
[5:06:42] <lloyddboy> always worth
[5:06:44] <LoneFonte> meh
[5:06:47] <%PaladinDupre> ....
[5:06:47] <+metalwolfchaos> got me preaching like jesus shit man
[5:06:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> might as well
[5:06:57] <whazat> bullseye first
[5:06:58] <0rond> defect actually has a super synergistic 0 cost card archetype deck, but I think the core cards aren't unlocked by default
[5:06:59] <%Keyd00d> nice
[5:07:03] <lloyddboy> nice
[5:07:05] <zenith0111> Dualcast Kreygasm
[5:07:06] <sectorquack> yes
[5:07:06] <$lotharrio> Clean
[5:07:07] <%Keyd00d> he's starting to believe
[5:07:09] <%Agami23> orb man!
[5:07:12] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Defect is really good once you get it
[5:07:13] <sectorquack> darkness
[5:07:14] <Louie_Salmon> Defect is my favorite
[5:07:14] <+skm742> robot go bzzzzzzzz
[5:07:15] <%Agami23> just got back, love orb man
[5:07:16] <lloyddboy> COWARD
[5:07:18] <$RealThiele> o r b
[5:07:18] <%bevyrage> 1 was great for card draw
[5:07:19] <%StaceMcGate> Narrator: He was not getting it
[5:07:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> O R B
[5:07:20] <+MrAtheGreat> lmao
[5:07:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's nice how every character can get real goofy
[5:07:22] <$RealThiele> DANK
[5:07:22] <0rond> dark orbs good with recursion
[5:07:25] <%Brickhaus_> Brickhaus_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! I tricked Lex Luthor into giving Pat money so he can defeat Superman
[5:07:26] <sectorquack> recurs
[5:07:26] <bashful_bard> Free doesn't actually mean free when you're only drawing 5 cards
[5:07:37] <chocobodundee> defect has like 5 different builds
[5:07:49] <0rond> yeah, and card draw isn't top tier always when you only have 3 energy
[5:07:51] <0rond> it's not that simple
[5:08:01] <+MrAtheGreat> It';s random
[5:08:03] <heartlesshealer> random dps
[5:08:03] <aeonicvector> yup
[5:08:03] <sectorquack> rng
[5:08:04] <+GrandmasterBFunk> unlucky
[5:08:07] <+admiral_of_crunch> I really like most of the sub-classes you can build out of all these decks. Good variety
[5:08:08] <whazat> yeah the RNG is the only downside to lightning
[5:08:09] <%Keyd00d> he's starting to not believe
[5:08:11] <heartlesshealer> no, that was Dark
[5:08:12] <lloyddboy> that's DARK
[5:08:13] <+MrAtheGreat> That's dark
[5:08:14] <$lotharrio> Dark auto-targets the weakest.
[5:08:14] <Louie_Salmon> Nah, that's dark orbs
[5:08:15] <aeonicvector> there is a power that makes all zaps hit all tho
[5:08:15] <%Brickhaus_> Random meant random if you.... read
[5:08:16] <braincraft> Just wait until you're casting multiple Meteor Swarms in a round.
[5:08:17] <$RealThiele> lock on fixes that
[5:08:17] <LoneFonte> thats for DArk
[5:08:19] <heartlesshealer> Dark attacks weakest
[5:08:20] <whazat> dark does attack weakest, lightning is random
[5:08:26] <ha2ken> Believe in the chat that believes in you
[5:08:27] <+MrAtheGreat> NOW that slime is dead
[5:08:27] <%Grayhammatter> dark attacks the weakest
[5:08:31] <sectorquack> now defend
[5:08:34] <+admiral_of_crunch> It does
[5:08:39] <0rond> is meteor unlocked by default?
[5:08:39] <zenith0111> Dualcast! PogChamp
[5:08:46] <+MrAtheGreat> .... or the dark woulda killed it but that works too i guess
[5:08:50] <0rond> meteor is a crazy card
[5:08:51] <Louie_Salmon> @realthiele It used to, but they changed it. Now it's vulnerable but for orbs
[5:08:58] <sectorquack> defend
[5:09:04] <+MrAtheGreat> ded brid
[5:09:14] <bashful_bard> It isn't I think
[5:09:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> You're about to see weirder
[5:09:16] <LoneFonte> @0rond i think so
[5:09:18] <sectorquack> blizzard
[5:09:20] <%Brickhaus_> The beauty of Defect is when you have a lot of his stuff going off automatically
[5:09:22] <%Keyd00d> Holo maybe
[5:09:27] <chocobodundee> i want to see pats reaction to 7 orb slots
[5:09:31] <whazat> he has no frost cards, blizzard is kind of useless
[5:09:34] <aeonicvector> all 3 are alright, based on how you aim your strat
[5:09:34] <zenith0111> Hologram has its uses
[5:09:36] <%Visorak6> eyes can be clutch
[5:09:36] <anAngryHamster> Nothing personnel kid
[5:09:36] <0rond> the only problem with defect is that it tends to rely on rare cards
[5:09:38] <LoneFonte> Sadly, echo form is an unlockable
[5:09:41] <%SirGO0SE> lord of orb
[5:09:42] <%Spydurman> skip
[5:09:43] <%Grayhammatter> hologram. you have no way to channel frost
[5:09:47] <%Keyd00d> can depend on your build
[5:09:47] <%thebeargoesHONK> not blizzard unless you are committing to frost orbs
[5:09:50] <+MrAtheGreat> I mean it's free so why nopt
[5:09:58] <+gumballwizard> Upgrade hologram is great
[5:10:02] <+GrandmasterBFunk> also important to not take on too many cards
[5:10:09] <$RealThiele> all 4 one build is amazing till you hit sluggo
[5:10:10] <+PharosOfLight> huh, weird, go for the eyes didnt have the yellow glow
[5:10:16] <0rond> y'all 0 cost isn't free, cards are a resource
[5:10:17] <zenith0111> Dualcasting Kreygasm
[5:10:18] <bashful_bard> They all rely on rare cards
[5:10:23] <heartlesshealer> now you do
[5:10:26] <heartlesshealer> ????
[5:10:26] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> you have stomach orb
[5:10:28] <lloyddboy> pat...
[5:10:30] <heartlesshealer> Pat?
[5:10:31] <$RealThiele> use your inner orb
[5:10:34] <LoneFonte> pat?
[5:10:39] <+ArtemisCroc> ????
[5:10:39] <SegaDSi> Defect Always feels the Easiest to get the ball rolling. I've been trying Achevos with Silent And boy does that take some working
[5:10:40] <+MrAtheGreat> ZAp
[5:10:41] <%Visorak6> thats free damage pat
[5:10:42] <+CaptainJax> pat why did you not
[5:10:42] <heartlesshealer> a learning appear
[5:10:42] <+Jaromero435> Recurssion is free
[5:10:43] <+tacostarvedbeast> all for one isn't an unlockable though right?
[5:10:44] <%Andrizzleton> this is the hardest character imo
[5:10:46] <whazat> recursion would be good here
[5:10:49] <sectorquack> ys
[5:10:51] <%Brickhaus_> If the card drops suck, you can always choose to skip picking them up
[5:10:52] <+metalwolfchaos> BROK!
[5:10:56] <sectorquack> hes LEARNING
[5:11:00] <lloyddboy> claw build Kreygasm
[5:11:05] <0rond> D A C L A W
[5:11:07] <sectorquack> coolheaded gives orb
[5:11:08] <%linSP> master of the orb
[5:11:08] <$RealThiele> claw 4 one
[5:11:09] <%Keyd00d> Claw can be great if you get a bunch
[5:11:10] <0rond> claw builds are super fun

[5:11:54] <whazat> just a random card
[5:11:55] <%Keyd00d> any blue card
[5:11:58] <+nictron90> No it creates them out of nothing, and fills your deck with them
[5:11:59] <+Quack_of_Dawn> That's called drawing, Patrick
[5:12:00] <Explodincatz> u wish
[5:12:03] <+MrAtheGreat> That's really good then
[5:12:03] <+ArtemisCroc> no hello world clutters your deck with random crap
[5:12:05] <+CaptainJax> yeah it's SHIT
[5:12:05] <chocobodundee> they stay for the whole battle too

[5:12:11] <0rond> not any blue card, only common ones
[5:12:26] <%Keyd00d> yeah my bad
[5:12:28] <+admiral_of_crunch> Cards that create new cards in your deck are top tier. Big bullshit potential
[5:12:34] <0rond> remember pat, you want to be a THIN. DECK. DADDY.
[5:12:40] <sectorquack> STORM

[5:14:00] <%Grayhammatter> monkaS
[5:14:00] <aeonicvector> eyes
[5:14:05] <$spardanwarrior> Getting it to half health cancels its action
[5:14:13] <+MrAtheGreat> Bullseye then recurssion
[5:14:13] <+tacostarvedbeast> time to get some batteries
[5:14:17] <$RealThiele> goo'ed ya

[5:14:41] <aeonicvector> go for its eyes
[5:14:45] <0rond> you can take this hit
[5:14:52] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Darkness
[5:14:57] <%Keyd00d> oh shit
[5:14:57] <chocobodundee> ez
[5:14:59] <LoneFonte> @Agami23 actually that became a big mod overhaul where you play as bosses protecting the spire
[5:15:00] <whazat> nice
[5:15:04] <+MrAtheGreat> good shit
[5:15:05] <+FlyingRamen> ehhhh
[5:15:06] <0rond> this is the worst possible outcome
[5:15:07] <rasamune> Nice!
[5:15:14] <%Keyd00d> jphCoggers
[5:15:15] <+MrAtheGreat> NOW ITS TWO SLIMES
[5:15:16] <+FlyingRamen> worst split
[5:15:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeaaaaaaaah
[5:15:22] <%Agami23> @LoneFonte thats sick
[5:15:23] <DarthFreeman> Surprisingly slow chat tonight, wow.
[5:15:25] <sectorquack> use all your potions
[5:15:26] <aeonicvector> Choose one to focus
[5:15:26] <heartlesshealer> I recommend destroying the Left slime
[5:15:27] <SegaDSi> Yay more enemies
[5:15:28] <+admiral_of_crunch> Slime boss splits at half health, which interrupts his previous move. Capitalize on that fact. Or don't.
[5:15:32] <rasamune> You got this Pat
[5:15:40] <%Keyd00d> oof
[5:15:41] <chocobodundee> @PatStaresAt Dont forget your potions!
[5:15:43] <0rond> should have taken the hit to split him better
[5:15:47] <%Mendin> Don't forget your potions Pat
[5:15:51] <Vermillion129> Pat use those damn card
[5:15:53] <+MrAtheGreat> BIGGER SLIME
[5:15:56] <%Visorak6> you have to play the slimes
[5:15:57] <%Keyd00d> don't forget
[5:16:00] <heartlesshealer> So Slime cards do not have Ethereal, and will stay in your deck forever until you Play them
[5:16:01] <+tacostarvedbeast> their not great potions anyways
[5:16:03] <+MrAtheGreat> Still ghot that lizard tail too
[5:16:06] <chocobodundee> doesnt matter how much dmg you take as long as you win
[5:16:08] <0rond> dualcast recursion

[5:16:16] <whazat> there you go, beautiful
[5:16:16] <%DappercatEsquire> nice
[5:16:16] <NeutrinoInteraction> Always remember your potions during boss fights, it helps you remember them in normal gameplay too
[5:16:17] <%linSP> hell yeah
[5:16:20] <0rond> that's good shit
[5:16:21] <LoneFonte> @Agami23 it really is, floor bosses become the player characters and can see the cards they will use and all
[5:16:21] <aeonicvector> just skipped 1/3rd of the bossfight
[5:16:21] <+metalwolfchaos> brokions
[5:16:24] <bashful_bard> Nice
[5:16:25] <whazat> one slime completely dead is big
[5:16:32] <rasamune> Remember: The only stupid death is one where you didn't use all your resources
[5:16:34] <+MrAtheGreat> corrsive shit oh nooooo
[5:16:36] <sectorquack> barrage
[5:16:41] <%linSP> dual casting a chonky dark orb is the shit

[5:17:27] <0rond> gracefully end your turn
[5:17:28] <whazat> nice clean win
[5:17:29] <sectorquack> ded
[5:17:34] <lloyddboy> nice
[5:17:35] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Strength is usually best at the start of the fight
[5:17:36] <%goose_attack_almanac> If you straight up kill one of the larger slimes they can't split
[5:17:36] <heartlesshealer> !
[5:17:38] <rasamune> got 'em
[5:17:39] <+MrAtheGreat> spam them orbs son

[5:18:10] <%DappercatEsquire> busted crown
[5:18:12] <%Brickhaus_> Frozen changes your deck to a frost deck
[5:18:14] <heartlesshealer> Crown probably
[5:18:14] <whazat> busted crown is pretty good
[5:18:15] <%Grayhammatter> crown

[5:18:54] <whazat> he is on ascension 0
[5:18:55] <%afronooch> A0
[5:18:56] <+FlyingRamen> 0
[5:18:57] <heartlesshealer> FRESH SAVE NO ASCENSION

[5:19:01] <LoneFonte> @Scrummo dude, its his 3rd run ever
[5:19:01] <%linSP> lol he just started
[5:19:02] <+tacostarvedbeast> too soon, no ascension yet
[5:19:03] <%Agami23> 0, you are brand new
[5:19:06] <0rond> asc is harder difficuilties
[5:19:06] <+FlyingRamen> has not beat a run yet
[5:19:08] <lloyddboy> dual first
[5:19:08] <%Keyd00d> Only when you've beaten it
[5:19:11] <aeonicvector> Ascensions are NG+ effectivley
[5:19:11] <$spardanwarrior> Ascension is postgame, don't worry about it
[5:19:13] <LoneFonte> @PatStaresAt dont worry
[5:19:14] <+FlyingRamen> Ascension = NG+
[5:19:15] <$lotharrio> Dual then Multi
[5:19:15] <%thebeargoesHONK> beat gam, unlock harder version'
[5:19:22] <%Visorak6> ascension is modifiers once you beat a run
[5:19:24] <+MrAtheGreat> Burn energy for full attack
[5:19:24] <%arancet> ascension is this game's pact of punishment
[5:19:28] <%thebeargoesHONK> NG+ stacks though
[5:19:30] <+admiral_of_crunch> Pat hasn't started the game yet, shh
[5:19:32] <%DappercatEsquire> get some focus in there
[5:19:32] <%Kinoskae> Ascension = Bonfire Aesthetic
[5:19:40] <%Keyd00d> I've only gotten to 7
[5:19:40] <Scrummo> oh sorry dude, didn't mean to spoil anything
[5:19:44] <+metalwolfchaos> make it so i could do that with a hammer brok
[5:19:53] <aeonicvector> no worries, not a beeg spoiler
[5:19:58] <%Keyd00d> barrage em
[5:19:59] <+tacostarvedbeast> holo plus 0 cost cards is great
[5:20:07] <%Grayhammatter> nice
[5:20:09] <%Keyd00d> EZ
[5:20:13] <+GrandmasterBFunk> thicc damage
[5:20:18] <%Grayhammatter> EZ
[5:20:18] <rasamune> Large slaps
[5:20:18] <heartlesshealer> Pat?
[5:20:21] <sectorquack> gg
[5:20:25] <+CaptainJax> PAT
[5:20:29] <%Agami23> pat you had an extra energy
[5:20:29] <%thebeargoesHONK> wait till you get the monk
[5:20:30] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:20:30] <+metalwolfchaos> brokanese
[5:20:32] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah, definitely a step up from the first 2
[5:20:34] <%linSP> theres a lot of builds you can do with roboi
[5:20:34] <aeonicvector> Most complicated character in the game, but he pays out
[5:20:35] <+GrandmasterBFunk> did pat pass for no reason?
[5:20:35] <aretos1> math power
[5:20:36] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, Orb is strategies
[5:20:39] <%Grayhammatter> more recursion!
[5:20:40] <%DappercatEsquire> he can be very uncomplicated, depends on the build
[5:20:42] <%linSP> you can go full orb, or no orb
[5:20:45] <chocobodundee> watcher is my fav
[5:20:48] <%Visorak6> silent is newbie friendly defect is big brain
[5:20:48] <Scrummo> Recursion combos really well with dark orbs, as it doesn't deplete their dark value
[5:20:49] <+tacostarvedbeast> yea robot is way more about high rolling specific cards imo
[5:20:50] <heartlesshealer> do it
[5:20:51] <$RealThiele> defect is pretty blue
[5:20:52] <Louie_Salmon> Actually we can't tell if he has extra energy, since it's behind the overlay
[5:20:54] <%bevyrage> dump it all
[5:20:55] <%Brickhaus_> Potions exist
[5:20:56] <0rond> @PatStaresAt at this point enemies will become significantly harder, you want to go to question marks if possible
[5:21:04] <%Agami23> this character feels like something woolie would play since he loves setting things up and controlling a fight
[5:21:04] <CrimsonFox777> The Defect is awesome if you can get just start creating lightning orbs out the wazoo.
[5:21:08] <SegaDSi> Defects fun When you know what to Build Around.
[5:21:09] <%bevyrage> don't forget your potions pat
[5:21:13] <$lotharrio> Lots of hits. Might be doable.
[5:21:22] <heartlesshealer> We can tell if Pat has enough energy to play a card in his hand by the Number colors
[5:21:22] <%Broand> Defect has an alternate build which is all about boosting yourself with power cards to insane levels
[5:21:22] <bashful_bard> He has 4 energy
[5:21:26] <+tacostarvedbeast> but an all for one robot deck is too fun
[5:21:27] <%Keyd00d> should've barraged
[5:21:34] <%linSP> oof barrage wouldve taken 3 armor
[5:21:34] <heartlesshealer> but we won't know the exact number at a glance
[5:21:37] <%Keyd00d> PAT
[5:21:38] <lloyddboy> pat
[5:21:38] <Louie_Salmon> LUL
[5:21:40] <%Visorak6> barrage will strip more armor
[5:21:41] <0rond> now imagine you play all 4 one and the zaps and recursion and go for the eyes come back to your hand and you can play the magain
[5:21:42] <%linSP> LUL
[5:21:44] <%bevyrage> every time
[5:21:45] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:21:50] <$lotharrio> Big brain baby Pat.
[5:21:53] <%Brickhaus_> Good thing New Blood let us know Pat is a coward who doesn't use a mouse
[5:21:53] <+metalwolfchaos> BROK
[5:21:54] <zenith0111> Doing strike over barrage NotLikeThis
[5:22:00] <%Agami23> if you played on a mouse this would not happen
[5:22:05] <%Keyd00d> Order is importante
[5:22:12] <%thebeargoesHONK> X cards use all your power. just FYI
[5:22:15] <SegaDSi> Are any Focus Cards available on default?
[5:22:17] <ergulor> As much as i want to shit on pat he just played 3 runs
[5:22:29] <ergulor> cut him some slack
[5:22:31] <+MrAtheGreat> Burn orb for BIG POOOOOOOWER
[5:22:31] <ManfredA> defect is tough if you're new to him
[5:22:33] <rasamune> I'm sad that the touchscreen controls suck ass in the Switch version
[5:22:40] <0rond> no! he needs to beat the secret boss NOW
[5:22:42] <+PharosOfLight> @SegaDSi consume is, but I dont think debug is
[5:22:43] <chocobodundee> i like how different all the characters are
[5:22:47] <%arancet> hes cool though
[5:22:48] <whazat> defect is super weird, but i love him
[5:22:52] <+tacostarvedbeast> shades or doramaumu
[5:22:54] <sectorquack> and fun
[5:22:59] <@SoFarFetched> But Pat you HAVE Orb yourself,how can orb mechanic be weird for you Kappa
[5:23:00] <CrimsonFox777> Wait til you play as the Watcher
[5:23:01] <%Keyd00d> praise the orb
[5:23:01] <0rond> defect is my favorite
[5:23:03] <ManfredA> I think you'll like the final character more
[5:23:03] <Louie_Salmon> The defect looks just like Pat
[5:23:05] <+metalwolfchaos> why does you keep shhing LUL LUL
[5:23:12] <heartlesshealer> White Noise <3
[5:23:17] <%Gogogolem> Character whose all passives.
[5:23:17] <LoneFonte> LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
[5:23:18] <sectorquack> WHITE NOISE is so good
[5:23:21] <%linSP> power runs are insane
[5:23:23] <+valiard> he benefits from focused builds
[5:23:23] <0rond> @PatStaresAt what do you say pat, is the O R B superior to the C U B E
[5:23:24] <Louie_Salmon> White noise is weirdly good
[5:23:25] <zenith0111> WTF
[5:23:26] <+MrAtheGreat> KILL BIRD
[5:23:28] <%arancet> i cant even remember what the final char is, been too long since i played
[5:23:28] <aretos1> UPGRADE THAT SHIT BRUH
[5:23:29] <zenith0111> RNG
[5:23:30] <+RyTYoung> Ive now beat Hades with 3 different weapons wooo
[5:23:36] <%Brickhaus_> You don't have to take the card it gives you, you can skip and refuse it
[5:23:38] <%Keyd00d> I see two birds
[5:23:41] <+tacostarvedbeast> weirdly? free power cards is always good
[5:23:44] <braincraft> Mummy hand + lots of powers = insanity
[5:23:48] <SegaDSi> Yes, beeeg deck
[5:23:52] <sectorquack> upgrade white noise asap
[5:23:54] <ManfredA> I just got back from playing Monster Train and that update is great
[5:23:59] <%chiazam> Man Pat’s been going for a while
[5:24:01] <+metalwolfchaos> brok with the ether lightning

[5:24:05] <%chiazam> !uptime
[5:24:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 24m.
[5:24:09] <0rond> the other "add a random X to your hand" cards are pretty bad
[5:24:13] <SegaDSi> That Power is the Shit
[5:24:19] <0rond> only white noise is pretty good
[5:24:21] <sectorquack> monkas

[5:24:25] <whazat> you will see it after this run even if you don't play
[5:24:25] <heartlesshealer> You'll find out
[5:24:27] <%Keyd00d> they're even more big brain imo
[5:24:28] <%Visorak6> Watcher
[5:24:30] <aeonicvector> Its Batman, but amish
[5:24:32] <+Majiinbooh> when u end this run you will find out
[5:24:35] <rasamune> Fourth character is somehow more complicated!
[5:24:35] <LoneFonte> @PatStaresAt 4th character needs to win a run
[5:24:36] <ergulor> Ath
[5:24:36] <ManfredA> you gotta win a run to unlock them
[5:24:36] <%Grayhammatter> you'll find out
[5:24:37] <ergulor> Math
[5:24:42] <+MrAtheGreat> Problem is with third is that he's got a slow start to battle. He's gotta build his orb collection
[5:24:44] <+tacostarvedbeast> i still suck at 4th character
[5:24:47] <%AncelDeLambert> holy shit Pat's still playing?
[5:24:49] <%Agami23> 4th character was added after i stopped so even i dont know
[5:24:51] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Wait they added a fourth?
[5:24:54] <+metalwolfchaos> shhh for what brok who gives a fuck were bored

[5:24:56] <$spardanwarrior> Stance character
[5:24:59] <heartlesshealer> Eh, equal amounts big brain, but less planning ahead

[5:25:22] <+PharosOfLight> Fourth character is the watcher, they have stances they shift around in

[5:25:45] <%linSP> thank god he didnt miss lethal
[5:25:50] <sectorquack> NO
[5:25:53] <+tacostarvedbeast> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[5:25:54] <%Keyd00d> Pat is everyone's winning son
[5:25:55] <sectorquack> you need to go to the store
[5:25:55] <+admiral_of_crunch> Stance switching dance combo bimbo and I love her
[5:25:56] <0rond> not free, takes a card
[5:25:57] <%Brickhaus_> Don't trust the obvious Vampire
[5:25:58] <%StaceMcGate> NO
[5:25:58] <Scrummo> yum yum
[5:25:59] <+Quack_of_Dawn> YES
[5:25:59] <+lord_campbell96> 4th character is stance character and she can SCRY
[5:25:59] <sectorquack> also dont take that
[5:26:01] <+MrAtheGreat> Ooo okay
[5:26:02] <aeonicvector> high risk
[5:26:02] <Louie_Salmon> Uhhh maybe
[5:26:04] <%Visorak6> YOU HAVE SO MUCH GOLD
[5:26:06] <0rond> fuck it I say take it
[5:26:06] <whazat> attacks to heal, but lose max HP
[5:26:07] <lloyddboy> VAMPIRE ROBOT
[5:26:07] <sectorquack> NO
[5:26:08] <%afronooch> LUL
[5:26:09] <%DappercatEsquire> eh they don't scale
[5:26:09] <+metalwolfchaos> god knows we dont fuck that brok
[5:26:09] <sectorquack> PAT WHY
[5:26:09] <heartlesshealer> No one tell Pat the secret of that event
[5:26:10] <$RealThiele> boo this vampire
[5:26:12] <%Brickhaus_> Well, now you'll know
[5:26:13] <%linSP> hes a crazy man
[5:26:14] <ManfredA> tip for the defect is mainly that he wants to focus on one kind of orb unless you know what you're doing and go for either a crazy multi orb build or just go for claws
[5:26:17] <+tacostarvedbeast> strikes are ass, any excuse to get rid of them
[5:26:21] <%Keyd00d> Pat discarded his humanity
[5:26:21] <zenith0111> RIP MAX HP
[5:26:28] <%Keyd00d> Also how does the Efect bite
[5:26:31] <%Keyd00d> *Defect
[5:26:39] <cherrycottontail> the only hp that matters is the last one
[5:26:43] <lloyddboy> norbs
[5:26:44] <0rond> @PatStaresAt resting heals based on max HP, less max HP, less healing
[5:26:45] <%Brickhaus_> The More You Know™
[5:26:47] <Louie_Salmon> 56 is still decent max HP
[5:26:47] <SegaDSi> Pat may dies here
[5:26:49] <lloyddboy> USE POT
[5:26:56] <$RealThiele> he bits with his central orb
[5:27:01] <+MrAtheGreat> BARRAGE PogChamp
[5:27:05] <tanarath> Potions
[5:27:05] <sectorquack> potion
[5:27:08] <%Brickhaus_> @lloyddboy I would if it were legal
[5:27:11] <lloyddboy> they heal better than you LUL
[5:27:17] <LoneFonte> he scratches with the pointy bits
[5:27:22] <0rond> oh nooo he is falling for the bait
[5:27:23] <TheFunniestValentine926> Why does this game look like s Newgrounds flash game?
[5:27:28] <Louie_Salmon> This is a trick, it's actually better to focus the knight here
[5:27:31] <Scrummo> I always kill the knight first. The knight gets more attacks if you kill the cleric first
[5:27:33] <0rond> this fight is bait, you need to kill the tank first
[5:27:40] <zenith0111> NICE LUL
[5:27:44] <heartlesshealer> Why????
[5:27:44] <%Keyd00d> why did you not weaken him
[5:27:48] <lloyddboy> the pat has given up
[5:27:49] <heartlesshealer> Eyes on attackers
[5:27:52] <aeonicvector> always eyes the attacker, its basically a half defense buff
[5:27:53] <%Visorak6> ??????
[5:27:54] <%Keyd00d> eh first time it's fine
[5:28:00] <sectorquack> WHITE NOSIE

[5:28:05] <SegaDSi> Its Fine hes learning
[5:28:07] <chocobodundee> i never kill the tank first lol
[5:28:09] <Louie_Salmon> Oh boy
[5:28:12] <whazat> oh boy
[5:28:14] <%Keyd00d> that can be a bane
[5:28:14] <%bevyrage> this is like his fourth time fighting this pair
[5:28:14] <%Brickhaus_> Snecko Knight is gonna clap ya
[5:28:15] <LoneFonte> hmmmm
[5:28:16] <heartlesshealer> It is done, he did the move
[5:28:17] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Let him get baited
[5:28:20] <heartlesshealer> Fight Fast
[5:28:29] <whazat> pat sabotaging his run so he can end the stream faster
[5:28:31] <TheFunniestValentine926> When's Eekum Bokum?
[5:28:36] <Mrthefro> There is now a timer LUL
[5:28:36] <zenith0111> Oh he's dead

[5:36:22] <+MrAtheGreat> Run ruined
[5:36:23] <Scrummo> Snecko can help you sometimes. If all your cards are 2s and 3s by default, for example
[5:36:24] <NiktenKing> it was your bottled card
[5:36:27] <$RealThiele> eekum bokum
[5:36:29] <braincraft> Speed reader here.
[5:36:33] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Relic you bought from the store made the card innate
[5:36:38] <%Keyd00d> there's a bottle icon on it
[5:36:39] <+admiral_of_crunch> Can't wait for pat to make an entire innate first hand full of buffs that are useless on their own.
[5:36:44] <aeonicvector> lol no worries, its a learning experience\
[5:36:47] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's all good. First time
[5:36:56] <whazat> first run, it's fine
[5:36:57] <%Brickhaus_> Ultrakill vibes with this robot fueled by blood

[5:37:44] <+PharosOfLight> FYI Pat, recuring a dark orb keeps it at the charge level it had
[5:37:45] <reonome> O R B
[5:37:50] <aeonicvector> An orb to go with your cube
[5:37:55] <sectorquack> oooooooorb
[5:37:55] <%AzureGale> Pat has four orbs
[5:37:56] <$lotharrio> Pat, consider acquiring more ORB
[5:37:59] <Scrummo> try to recur dark orbs. they keep their dark buildup with recursion
[5:38:00] <+Quack_of_Dawn> We know that you're all about them balls
[5:38:01] <%Keyd00d> If only there was a cube character
[5:38:05] <$RealThiele> robotic orb is too complex for fleshy man
[5:38:07] <reonome> oh pat did the vampire event lol
[5:38:25] <SegaDSi> Pat how do you like Buff stacking.

[5:41:22] <+admiral_of_crunch> I guess "advanced" should be closer to "anything more than base block and ice"
[5:41:26] <0rond> he has the intangible thing but it's not exactly reliable

[5:50:40] <heartlesshealer> It fully supports Steam Workshop mods
[5:50:48] <lloyddboy> How is it compared to Monster Train?
[5:50:49] <mattatatatatatatat> give it that hearthstone spunk
[5:50:51] <%DappercatEsquire> you should see some of the beta art, oh man
[5:50:53] <%afronooch> yeah
[5:50:54] <%TheWinged7> will you try monster train? its similar in deck building rougelite
[5:50:57] <%Ranryu692> it looks like a browser game
[5:51:02] <Scrummo> I think it's part of the games identity by now
[5:51:07] <heartlesshealer> Beta art was silly
[5:51:07] <$RealThiele> the modded classes are cool, i played a broken necromancer LUL
[5:51:10] <%DappercatEsquire> it's roooooough
[5:51:15] <%bevyrage> it also needs a better button for the end turn
[5:51:24] <%bevyrage> one that you don't hit regularly
[5:51:24] <%AzureGale> I'm digging Rogue Wednesdays

[5:52:36] <+Troispoint> dry air oof
[5:52:39] <Scrummo> is Spelunky 2 on that list?
[5:52:39] <@SoFarFetched> they tend to be more night people

[5:53:52] <@PeachSaliva> @phantomsleeves it’s always been this lawl
[5:53:53] <%TheWinged7> Spelunky 2 just dropped
[5:53:58] <%Agami23> hey, just to let you know the game monster train is basically slay the spire with summoning units rather than doing attacks
[5:54:00] <+metalwolfchaos> brokending
[5:54:01] <$LegendGHT> oh okay that makes more sense

[5:56:18] <+SH1NK1R0> @agami23 that reboot happened years ago. It’s just getting animated now
[5:56:23] <$RealThiele> thats just a mud pie or dirt pie or worm food sundae etc

[5:56:44] <%AdamElJefe> It's just from Asuna's perspective
[5:56:46] <%Agami23> @SH1NK1R0 oh i know.
[5:57:07] <%Agami23> @AdamElJefe so its not a reboot, its just retelling the story differently?
[5:57:28] <$RealThiele> BIG DUMB
[5:57:31] <%AdamElJefe> @Agami23 correct
[5:57:34] <+SH1NK1R0> @adameljefe it’s actually is a reboot. It’s a complete retelling of the first arc

[5:59:21] <%AdamElJefe> @Agami23 no, the same things still happen, it's just from Asuna's perspective
[5:59:28] <%CalderGaming> ok I laughed at being reminded about Death Bed
[5:59:44] <heartlesshealer> crusader kings is a goblins game
[5:59:48] <%AdamElJefe> @SH1NK1R0 It's not altered at all, it's the same story, just from a different perspective
[5:59:49] <%Monkeyweed21> PAt would have a nervous break in the tutorial
[5:59:51] <@SoFarFetched> You also had horrible mind goblins when you tried playing Crusader King 3 LUL
[5:59:55] <+SH1NK1R0> @agami23 yes different things do happen. The characters have different interactions and personalities and the story goes floor by floor. Adam is literally misinformed
[5:59:56] <%SaiyanShoto> @rushunplugged oof the subreddit can be so bad at times
