[0:26:45] <%SilverFist91> it's a state of mind, yo
[0:26:46] <Yomandude> Age is a myth, like North Dakota
[0:26:48] <+Ryallen> And donations
[0:26:49] <Animeshowfan> try saying age is a state of mind when your 90 years old
[0:26:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> DA BEST DWARF
[0:26:49] <vingadivo> you can play FFT pretty smootly with the android emulator
[0:26:49] <PakuV2> Brittle bones and cataracts are a state of mind
[0:26:51] <gut_punch> but FFT is just reskined Tactics ogre
[0:26:52] <$RaikenTB> Age is a state of fatigue.
[0:26:52] <+HelloImTom08> age is based on how much your knees hurt on a daily basis

[0:35:06] <ten_boy> When Pat turns 50 his hair will return, it is foretold.
[0:35:06] <inz0mbiac> does this version allow you to shank Algus in the plains when you find him?
[0:35:09] <misterspotswood> i played this on the PSP

[0:35:21] <SwiftFission> did you patch the game for the shitty slowdowns?
[0:35:23] <%captainthunderwolf> I'm an Aries instead of a Pisces when you adjust the calendar, and that shit makes perfect sense.
[0:35:24] <elementofloyalty> RIDE THE CHICKEN
[0:35:24] <$Taisuru> These are not the smae custcenes at all
[0:35:26] <$SGrim> @rdark_ksu he didn't even list all of them. There's like 10.
[0:35:26] <%XzileGaming> @rdark_ksu why is the opposite of chinese, "normal"
[0:35:30] <%JaydenSai> @SwiftFission They did!
[0:35:30] <Invisoguy> they definitely re-did the opening cutscene to be different @AngriestPat
[0:35:38] <%Fenrirlives> SO YOU THINK YOU CAN RIDE THAT CHOCOBO
[0:35:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> Admittedly, I know very little about the Zodiacs- but I do know that Bull means stubborn.
[0:35:39] <+MightyMaxT> Ride ze Shoopuff
[0:35:39] <+Gahbba> some big ass ducks
[0:35:43] <+Nomicro4u> Thought this was FFTA for a second and was wondering how it even had cutscenes
[0:35:45] <SwiftFission> nice!
[0:35:47] <+LiveStreamOnyx> Looks like people forgot when some people tried to say there was a hidden Zodiac and try to make it revelant.....it didn’t last long
[0:35:49] <elementofloyalty> CHOCOSLICE
[0:35:53] <startadevy> it is special feature of console n stuff

[0:35:55] <Pappajimbo> do you want to ride my chocobo???
[0:35:55] <+LogothX> So that he can punch Ovelia in the babby oven
[0:35:56] <mr_slaide> Look at that hero.

[0:36:07] <+I_speel_my_dreenk> I love a good Chocolatebo
[0:36:08] <emperorhol> I remember the opening cutscene just being chocobos
[0:36:08] <%ssaryn> That would explain a lot about Pat.
[0:36:09] <vingadivo> BIG HERO MAN
[0:36:10] <Rafafidi> Delita did nothing wrong!
[0:36:11] <%rdark_ksu> @XzileGaming its the only other one I know and i live in the western hemisphere so the other half is the inverse in my mind which is china aka east.
[0:36:12] <+crimsonharvest> I'm really ready to get killed by archers in the second mission.
[0:36:13] <+Rabbitmage> Delita going his own way

[0:36:29] <@thenefftw> Look at protagonist man
[0:36:30] <mr_slaide> Yep. Nothing wrong happened to him!

[0:38:26] <HanPaul> Gaffgarion's portrait always gave me a laugh
[0:38:29] <kamen_advent> @AngriestPat Recent God of War patch lets you resize the text btw
[0:38:29] <+iHum4n> Its a psp game, so I'd hope the text is big
[0:38:32] <Invisoguy> This looks like it did when I streamed it on OG Ps1 and upscaled it thru composite to HDMI at widescreen and then had to squash it back down to standard def (AKA this emu looks not so hot)
[0:38:33] <%ssjklyco> God of Wars tone is so different, it makes me wonder if this was supposed to be a different game that someone said "Put Kratos in it."
[0:38:37] <Elexius> Speaking of big text, did you see God of War lets you change text size?
[0:38:39] <%Plutt_bug> as long as its not God of War size text!

[0:39:52] <PakuV2> Proper fucked
[0:39:58] <Personified134> @AngriestPat I love how there's that random squire there with ramza and gafgarion even though he's literally no one and has nothing special
[0:39:58] <%OdysseyKnight> My name is Pockets now!
[0:39:59] <+LogothX> and better than his act 3 outfit
[0:40:02] <elementofloyalty> Purple is fancy
[0:40:03] <$Chimeraelite> facts
[0:40:04] <vingadivo> true
[0:40:06] <$SGrim> @elementofloyalty that phrase has actually been used in Europe before. Basically the courtly way of telling someone to shut it, or have it shut for them.
[0:40:08] <+Rabbitmage> Agrias is trans
[0:40:10] <HanPaul> Act3 Ramza > Act 4 don't @ me
[0:40:12] <cherrycottontail> THROW THOSE FUCKING ROCKS
[0:40:12] <+Kinoskae> I was always partial to the GBA version of this game
[0:40:18] <+LogothX> lol
[0:40:18] <gut_punch> Jesus won't help in a fist fight
[0:40:22] <elementofloyalty> Because Twitch sucks ass
[0:40:22] <+GenesisKnight> Ramza: Pay Me!
[0:40:25] <+PenmanLupine> No idea. it happens to everyones stream
[0:40:27] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat it's just because Twitch's embedding sucks
[0:40:28] <$RaikenTB> you gotta edit it beforehand
[0:40:29] <Thalchampz> act4 outfit is best
[0:40:30] <Shimmying_skeleton> Speaking of GOW I gotta learn to not go on youtube when a major game is released place is a fucking minefield
[0:40:32] <laserbeaming> It's a cached title
[0:40:32] <Captain_Joe1911> :O
[0:40:33] <Personified134> "gba version" LuL
[0:40:33] <elementofloyalty> Got tama?
[0:40:34] <PulverKong> Yeah it says the stream you did last time
[0:40:34] <+iHum4n> Bad caching?
[0:40:36] <prime_name> Is Agarias a chick or a dude?
[0:40:37] <poweredscoot> Finally, Saber's origin story
[0:40:40] <Twoiis> Yell all day every day.
[0:40:43] <misterspotswood> dont call my waifu a wench

[0:42:23] <kamen_advent> Your birthday dictates Ramza's starting stats I think
[0:42:24] <AirlineFood74> @PulverKong it is
[0:42:24] <prime_name> I miss Ps1 sound effects.
[0:42:26] <mr_slaide> Woolie is vomiting at this very moment.
[0:42:26] <+Qexec> never rolled such a bad Ramza before
[0:42:26] <sileo_patronus> I onl ever played Tactics Advance
[0:42:27] <%JaydenSai> @PulverKong It is, in fact, his birthday
[0:42:27] <Personified134> is this just the vanilla game or are we 1.3 big boy mode
[0:42:31] <Genocalypse> I been playing this game on Mobile. Got Ramza to unlock Dark Knight in chapter 1.
[0:42:32] <kuningaz45> stop being old
[0:42:39] <+LogothX> Focus is p. good though
[0:42:42] <kamen_advent> You can patch the PSP translation into the PS1 version.
[0:42:46] <+Winnosh> Chant ok this is the PSP version
[0:42:46] <Aruezi> Guts was also cooler than Mettle
[0:42:47] <AnthroMetal> focus that bitch

[0:43:17] <Berendenn> Kill Gafgarion for exp
[0:43:22] <+GenesisKnight> 16 Japan points
[0:43:23] <%HiroTSK5> That new Dissidia wasn't great, but there was nothing in that game that brought me as much child-like glee as the Posh and Noble Ramza chucking rocks at people.
[0:43:26] <@CoalSavoie> Stasis Sword I miss you
[0:43:29] <mr_slaide> Alicia is hot.
[0:43:36] <fredan31> i wonder if you can still use focus to grinf lvl in the early game
[0:43:37] <iambqb> Can't Min/Max... yet
[0:43:39] <elementofloyalty> Jump up,jump up and get DOWN

[0:43:59] <Hispanacomida25> I rent that hoes helm so hard it left
[0:43:59] <@thenefftw> All the big heroes use items
[0:44:00] <AllTheZibas> Your missed the payment on your helmet LUL
[0:44:01] <+Rabbitmage> Pay the rent, Agrias.
[0:44:02] <PepperDryad> You can indeed still use focus to grind, I believe. Same as attacking/using shit on your allies
[0:44:04] <%ssjklyco> Someone didnt pay her RENT
[0:44:05] <cherrycottontail> i fucking love chemist
[0:44:05] <kamen_advent> wtf is with the sound effects?
[0:44:07] <+GenesisKnight> Was that guy named Biggs?
[0:44:08] <Strideral> Just noticed mostly everyone is blonde but one person has green hair.
[0:44:09] <elementofloyalty> revolked
[0:44:14] <+LogothX> Look at this gunless chemist
[0:44:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> 525,600 XP
[0:44:16] <%OdysseyKnight> Now just remember for several hours and hours that Agrias will have no helmet when she rejoins for the story
[0:44:17] <+trez_> lmao
[0:44:18] <elementofloyalty> FUCH?
[0:44:19] <Austin0097> THIS "YE OLDE" TRANSLATION IS THE FUCKING BEST!
[0:44:21] <+WaywardSera> Who's this Fuchs?
[0:44:21] <Malziel> LUL
[0:44:22] <%JaydenSai> Gunless Chemists are useless
[0:44:22] <PulverKong> So this is FF tactics..never seen the actual game
[0:44:23] <+TeethMuncher> @kamen_advent it was the 90's
[0:44:27] <@CoalSavoie> Did they fix the JP glitch in WOTL?
[0:44:29] <+LogothX> His name used to be RAD
[0:44:29] <AirlineFood74> that's not green hair. that's a hat
[0:44:36] <%OdysseyKnight> I think it was also Rad
[0:44:36] <+Rabbitmage> Fred Fuchs
[0:44:37] <kamen_advent> @TeethMuncher I don't remember them being this bad on PS1
[0:44:37] <elementofloyalty> Alicia is hot
[0:44:39] <%thefishofwar> Madd Ladd
[0:44:43] <+trez_> this guy fuchs
[0:44:44] <+Winnosh> Ladd. It was Radd in the original version.
[0:44:45] <Graywolf_the_45th> the fuchs
[0:44:54] <elementofloyalty> missed?
[0:44:55] <%Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> FFT is a baby game for babies
[0:44:56] <+LogothX> That's not new Pat.
[0:44:56] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> This is the best FF game, fight me.
[0:45:04] <Plague_bagel> these rolls LUL
[0:45:07] <holdyourfire> FeelsBirthdayMan
[0:45:13] <elementofloyalty> This is the game
[0:45:14] <+TeethMuncher> @kamen_advent when's the last time you played on the PS1 though?
[0:45:15] <+LogothX> No, the Dark Knight you can unlock is different from Gaffgarion's
[0:45:16] <chocobodundee> @cereal_box_conspiracy agree'd
[0:45:18] <+WaywardSera> Kill the healer!
[0:45:20] <+Winnosh> No one is going to fight you on this cerealbox
[0:45:21] <elementofloyalty> YEA
[0:45:23] <PepperDryad> I'll fight you - in FFT because it's the best and the PSP version has multiplayer
[0:45:24] <deviljhojho94> Nice strats boivino Keepo
[0:45:26] <+tigerdriver89> Love how everyone walks in place
[0:45:27] <+TeethMuncher> ooooh
[0:45:27] <Havren13> Happy birthday Patman! This is oddly uncanny cause I just started playing this game today after digging out my PSP a week ago.
[0:45:29] <chokingasuka> AUUUUggh
[0:45:29] <+Razputin217> Mercy down
[0:45:30] <kamen_advent> Audio seems to be having random slowdown I think
[0:45:34] <lazybaboon> Happy Birthday, may your speech continue to fail you FeelsBirthdayMan
[0:45:36] <%JaydenSai> @cereal_box_conspiracy Fight you? Hell no, I agree
[0:45:37] <Personified134> double stop holy shit
[0:45:40] <HanPaul> Ay-grias
[0:45:40] <+trez_> double stop Kreygasm
[0:45:41] <mr_slaide> Agrias is hot.
[0:45:45] <lamplight_> no drunk Paige singing happy birthday this year?
[0:45:49] <Thenuclearwalrus> That whole walking in place thing is so dumb LUL
[0:45:49] <PepperDryad> rule34 agrees
[0:45:53] <+LogothX> audio is fine
[0:45:56] <PulverKong> But I never liked tactic games I'd just suck at this
[0:45:57] <%OdysseyKnight> Fine here
[0:45:58] <prime_name> Audio is good
[0:45:58] <elementofloyalty> SEXY BIKINI PEACH SING HAPPY B DAY SOON?
[0:45:59] <MarylandJutsu> Audio is GOOD
[0:45:59] <$Taisuru> Audio is fine
[0:46:01] <AlasterAngelo> she falls off a cliff after a while
[0:46:01] <AirlineFood74> audio is good
[0:46:02] <kamen_advent> It's the music, it's random
[0:46:02] <@CoalSavoie> The game hiccups every now and then but generally is fine
[0:46:03] <+tigerdriver89> everyone moonwalking
[0:46:03] <+JustbeJake> I cant tell if it is
[0:46:03] <%JaydenSai> Audio is fine
[0:46:04] <+alpacasintophats> audio good
[0:46:04] <+TheBossSkeleton> fine
[0:46:05] <dmac63> audio seems fine
[0:46:06] <+LogothX> Look at this idiot casting fire
[0:46:06] <fredan31> it's good here
[0:46:09] <+Rabbitmage> The story characters in FFT are all OP
[0:46:09] <laserbeaming> I mean, people replace her with THE THUNDER GOD as soon as he joins
[0:46:13] <Jacknzack27> Seems fine to me
[0:46:14] <+bri8203> audio fine
[0:46:14] <%RAWKPARTEE> Audio is fine here.
[0:46:15] <MrKawaiiDessu> f
[0:46:18] <%thefishofwar> fine
[0:46:20] <+alpacasintophats> might be on his end
[0:46:23] <%Arazien> I wouldn't mind game audio up a little
[0:46:28] <Plague_bagel> no seriously fuck the enemy knights always fucking up your equips
[0:46:30] <+fistorage> wow my birthday was yesterday. Happy b day Pat.
[0:46:32] <PepperDryad> The PSP version had a terrible problem: FPS issues when casting/doing special effects. But it looks like the Emulator fixes the issue.
[0:46:35] <elementofloyalty> Lavian
[0:46:35] <kayamek> @laserbeaming To be fair you can replace the whole party for him.
[0:46:38] <PulverKong> is this a new version?
[0:46:40] <kamen_advent> PPSSPP is a fucking magic emulator
[0:46:43] <Malziel> ^
[0:46:43] <+Winnosh> laserbeaming he replaces every character so that's not fair to talk about
[0:46:46] <chocobodundee> I refused to use any of the special knights cause they're op
[0:46:50] <laserbeaming> LUL
[0:46:55] <Heyestus> One of the best things about FF tactics is that it repopularised the moonwalk for a whole new generation of weebs
[0:46:55] <NerevaRising> The mobile version is apparently pretty goof
[0:46:56] <+Highimbrighton> Waaaaaaah
[0:47:00] <$GohanEgret> crazy talk incoming
[0:47:02] <Captain_Joe1911> happy birthday @fistorage notekHug
[0:47:02] <elementofloyalty> How embarassing
[0:47:03] <mr_slaide> Unlike X-Com.
[0:47:03] <lamplight_> i should really play this game...
[0:47:05] <NerevaRising> *good
[0:47:10] <Thalchampz> @PepperDryad a patch fixed the slowdowns
[0:47:15] <+LogothX> I beat this like 12 times
[0:47:16] <elementofloyalty> 21 years ago
[0:47:24] <vingadivo> Kappa
[0:47:25] <cherrycottontail> man i want to get this rom
[0:47:25] <PepperDryad> Pulverking, this is the PSP version of the game, as opposed to the PS1 version. It adds new classes, animated cutscenes, and a terrible olde english accent.
[0:47:25] <PulverKong> X-Com the most glorious shitshow on the channel
[0:47:26] <AirlineFood74> judgement spelled wrong NotLikeThis
[0:47:29] <sileo_patronus> You didn't know what you were doing in xcom?
[0:47:29] <startadevy> eyy

[0:52:50] <%AbnormalVoid> Bravery is good for every unity
[0:52:51] <Fluke_M> Time to reroll
[0:52:51] <mr_slaide> The bravest of chemists.
[0:52:52] <MrKawaiiDessu> YEAH WE CHEMISTS CAN BE BRAVE TOO
[0:52:53] <+crimsonharvest> Freelance pharmacist super brave
[0:52:53] <Adamotron> He's so brave he puts bottles in other bottles, man.

[0:52:54] <+Gulping> Well the male chemist can reclass
[0:52:55] <TranquilTurnip> Pretty brave to work with volitile chemicals
[0:52:55] <deviljhojho94> Chemisits are the bravest race
[0:52:57] <poweredscoot> Need to be brave to mix chemicals
[0:52:57] <studleydoorite> she isn't afraid to mix acids and bases!
[0:53:00] <MelBrooksKA> Playing with explosives and poison makes you really brave
[0:53:00] <TheEvilOmega> Bravery is bad for a chemist.
[0:53:03] <Havren13> The hunted in the king's forest and shat in the privy's privy
[0:53:03] <@CoalSavoie> Guess you'll be buying mercs
[0:53:03] <elementofloyalty> Peach is drugged

[0:53:24] <mr_slaide> Isn't Paige dead in the hospital?
[0:53:27] <+SilverDevilfish> Don't forget the sexism (if they haven't changed it). Male has better PA, Female has better MA.
[0:53:28] <+Winnosh> Sound is wonky
[0:53:29] <$RaikenTB> @Rabbitmage Wouldn't that be a witch?

[0:53:38] <TheEvilOmega> Worker 8 is the third best party member.
[0:53:39] <elementofloyalty> @PulverKong She was in an UBER car accident and is drugged up
[0:53:40] <+bittahjuri> Orators can alter bravery and faith
[0:53:41] <sirrice77> Faith is also magic defense yeah?
[0:53:42] <%OdysseyKnight> Bravery and Faith do way more than that
[0:53:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> you mean like a horoscope?

[0:56:44] <+crimsonharvest> Who here went to sleep and woke up hearing this music?
[0:56:54] <+Gulping> Throw Item is innate for Chemists
[0:56:54] <+LogothX> That's an innate job skill for chemist pat, you always have it if you're a chemist
[0:56:55] <elementofloyalty> ELLS
[0:56:55] <TheEvilOmega> Chemists have Throw automatically;.

[0:58:03] <$ZechHarvey> Halstein and SHMOUGH
[0:58:04] <laserbeaming> this game starts soooo slow but it gets amazing by the end
[0:58:09] <%shin_garbage> i liked the gba game
[0:58:09] <$RaikenTB> Is the slowdown still a problem if you play this on PSP Go?
[0:58:12] <redsynod> when's my boy Chips the chemist
[0:58:15] <+Rabbitmage> GBA FFT is good, but the story will make you mad
[0:58:16] <%shin_garbage> it's just a very different tone
[0:58:30] <HanPaul> because little money
[0:58:32] <laserbeaming> @RaikenTB it's a software problem, you need to patch it
[0:58:33] <roada_rolla_da> @angriestpat whats your opinion on FF Tactics Advanced?
[0:58:36] <elementofloyalty> Never get behind,look what happen to Paige
[0:58:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yes
[0:58:38] <PulverKong> @AngriestPat IS PAIGE OKAY IN DE HOSPITAL :O
[0:58:39] <$RaikenTB> Dammit.
[0:58:39] <+crimsonharvest> You can patch the ISO on real hardware tho
[0:58:40] <+TeethMuncher> They're poor squires
[0:58:42] <TheEvilOmega> Ramza gon die.
[0:58:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> pat gon die
[0:58:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Squires aren't usually allowed to fight, are they? I thought they were just weapons caddies.
[0:58:48] <fredan31> how hard was it to get this running? Did you use PPSSPP?
[0:58:49] <lamplight_> im sure i have it on vita, is it slow on there?
[0:58:54] <+Gulping> kill the chemist pat
[0:58:55] <+TheGershon> No the patch works on hardware
[0:59:00] <%OdysseyKnight> or play that shit on a hacked PSP
[0:59:03] <elementofloyalty> Pat found a replacement Girlfriend
[0:59:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> no he wont
[0:59:11] <%YooshGeier> you can patch the psp version using custom firmware @AngriestPat
[0:59:14] <+TheGershon> Any PSP can and should be hacked
[0:59:15] <+crimsonharvest> If you have a way to run homebrew on the vita you can use a patched iso there too
[0:59:16] <$Taisuru> Delivious healing glass
[0:59:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> dammir
[0:59:17] <SwiftFission> you can use it on cfw psp
[0:59:28] <bielzitcho> he clearly grabbed the bottle in the air, pat
[0:59:29] <Strideral> Here's a potion! "AHHH MY FACE"
[0:59:32] <%shin_garbage> yeah but it's filled with healing liquid so it's more just diminishing returns more than anything
[0:59:33] <$RaikenTB> I have a PSP 2000 and Go.
[0:59:34] <%captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat The shattered glass wounds allow the potion to get into the body.

[0:59:50] <+SilverDevilfish> Delita being a huge hero from the back
[0:59:50] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Nothing heals a person more than shards of glass

[1:00:42] <%captainthunderwolf> @WHMBoar Except for when some of the glass stays underneath the skin, that's bad when it happens.

[1:03:38] <Marillderul0> the best leveling up method is a monk with chakra and give every gain jp up and accumulate

[1:03:45] <umbypokochan> FFA2 is good until you get those stupid FFXII characters
[1:03:46] <BizarreRevolver> A2 is best tactics
[1:03:49] <+Gulping> They're squires
[1:03:51] <elementofloyalty> Dog Shit
[1:03:52] <kamen_advent> One of my friends hates this game but loves FFTA, he has really bad opinions about PS1 JRPGs

[1:04:14] <elementofloyalty> Pat talks to himself in his room
[1:04:15] <%FriedMattato> It's a shame FFTA2 had the worst fucking story ever
[1:04:22] <+Rabbitmage> In this version you can get Balthier as a party member
[1:04:24] <%Arazien> The best Tactics games are this and Tactics Ogre: Knight of Lodis
[1:04:24] <+Gulping> There is literally only one case where low brave is good
[1:04:28] <+Gulping> Literally just one
[1:04:31] <BizarreRevolver> tactics ogre is best tactics
[1:04:35] <+Gulping> it's bad in every other scenario
[1:04:35] <+JakeIsNotGross> Does that also mean you get healed less?
[1:04:36] <deviljhojho94> I like the race selection of FFTA2
[1:04:38] <Innocuous_Goat> That does mean getting less health from healing magic though
[1:04:39] <deviljhojho94> Story was eh
[1:04:41] <TheEvilOmega> Move Find for the Estucheon 2.
[1:04:42] <$RaikenTB> The Tenchi Muyo tactics game was okay.

[1:04:50] <+Kiyosuki> @AngriestPat Sorry if this has been asked before, but are you at all interested in getting back on the 14 saddle once the second part of the Ivalice raid storyline is dropped?

[1:06:28] <GuelermeDias> No JP Glitch for us?
[1:06:29] <aversalammar> Ramza is the fuckboi
[1:06:29] <Twoiis> He has nice thigh high boots.
[1:06:30] <deviljhojho94> Id fuck him tbh
[1:06:30] <+Ryallen> It's still weird that Phil LaMarr voices Ramza. You know, Samurai Jack and Static Shock?
[1:06:31] <+Take_Mikazuchi_> But Kuja tho
[1:06:32] <Kaurisen> On this day pat recieved the birthday gift of homosexuality
[1:06:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> you 'saved' the village
[1:06:37] <+LuckyChocobo> Try not to get murdered by Wiegraf, emphasis on "try"
[1:06:41] <miguelrod777> it's not gay to fuck ramza
[1:06:44] <+Kiyosuki> At least Ramza's so damn fun gameplay wise in Dissidia though.
[1:06:45] <misterspotswood> just googled it WHAT THE FUCK? why is he so pretty?
[1:06:46] <WHMBoar> He's even prettier than Kuja
[1:06:47] <Innocuous_Goat> Like, even his body shape is super feminine
[1:06:49] <%Cynful_Pleasures> CHEAT TIME
[1:06:50] <$RaikenTB> da best illegal stream
[1:06:53] <%Cynful_Pleasures> BIG CHEATS
[1:06:54] <elementofloyalty> Select - Grey
[1:06:54] <$Taisuru> Magickombat
[1:06:57] <sileo_patronus> Does this tactics have the evil death zones on the map?
[1:07:01] <+Rabbitmage> Save states are cheating
[1:07:11] <Mr_LupLup> And cheating is for winners
[1:07:12] <ELuscious> @AngriestPat thoughts on A2?
[1:07:17] <elementofloyalty> SAVE STAT - FEEBLE
[1:07:21] <Scyllas> Its impossible not to be killed by Wiegraf.
[1:07:26] <+Razputin217> Lie, Cheat, Steal
[1:07:27] <gensoukaizou> PogChamp
[1:07:33] <+Kiyosuki> Save State = POWER
[1:07:34] <@CoalSavoie> THE MAP TEXT WOW
[1:07:34] <elementofloyalty> TOOL
[1:07:35] <PakuV2> WE SCUMMIN
[1:07:38] <umbypokochan> save states are important if you have a cat that will jump on your keyboard
[1:07:39] <%OdysseyKnight> Countdown to Pat accidentally saving at the wrong spot
[1:07:43] <+Rabbitmage> Pat putting save state on hotkey. Typical
[1:07:43] <iambqb> and skip so many random battles when grinding jobs
[1:07:43] <$GohanEgret> release the pee tape
[1:07:45] <elementofloyalty> REDBULL MAKES YOU OLD
[1:07:46] <Explodincatz> Piss counter : 1
[1:07:46] <%Arxel1> The greatest save scumming on twitch
[1:07:46] <HanPaul> i remember mapping a load state for maxi mum save scumming
[1:07:47] <TheEvilOmega> You know how I beat Wiegraf in the 1v1 my first time? I ran away and threw Axes at him.
[1:07:49] <SpookyBeef7> Wait, what emulator is that? It actually looks like a legit program and not some half-assed put together software that could potentially be virus-ridden.
[1:07:50] <sponsoredviewer910> empty the balls
[1:07:52] <+Kain5707> WASH YOUR HANDS!
[1:07:52] <AMajorTom> Hit that vape, super-high Pat
[1:07:53] <$ZechHarvey> Narator: He won't be back.
[1:07:55] <%JaydenSai> @OdysseyKnight It'll be in the Wiegraf fights or someshit
[1:07:56] <Hispanacomida25> Lie, cheat, steal only to blame yourself or god
[1:07:58] <bootysteve> I feel like watching Pat play this is invading his happy space
[1:07:59] <+LuckyChocobo> Looks like PPSSPP
[1:07:59] <iambqb> ppsspp
[1:08:00] <Mr_LupLup> @SpookyBeef7 PPSSPP
[1:08:02] <$Zero_Awakening> the ball-gas shall be purged
[1:08:04] <laserbeaming> is he gonna cheat the RNG with save states?
[1:08:06] <Mr_LupLup> Aka the best PSP emulator
[1:08:07] <elementofloyalty> Pats balls are covered in grey hair and dangle very low
[1:08:08] <@CoalSavoie> Save-scumming will be necessary if he wants to avoid random battles... since battles last half an hour in this game
[1:08:10] <aversalammar> PSPENIS
[1:08:14] <iambqb> Which of all the ones I've used is one of the best emulators in general
[1:08:18] <TheEvilOmega> Wiegraf can use his holy knight abilities without a sword. =/
[1:08:19] <elementofloyalty> MUSTARD IV
[1:08:23] <iambqb> Lotta QoL features
[1:08:25] <%HiroTSK5> Save States on the WiiU are the scariest thing, I'm always afraid of loading a state and losing all progress
[1:08:29] <elementofloyalty> RIP PAIGE
[1:08:29] <%JaydenSai> @TheEvilOmega It's such bullshit
[1:08:31] <Sypheck> I think once you best this game legit at least once you've earned every right to fucking cheat. Theres only so much time in the world to be playing this shit legit again.
[1:08:36] <GuelermeDias> I wanna see if Pat goes straight to Ninja or Monk like the trash he is
[1:08:36] <+VanaSkiller> !uptime
[1:08:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 8m 45s.
[1:08:38] <+Kiyosuki> Taking blame yourself or god out, even rearranging it was such a big no no for the new translation to do
[1:08:54] <elementofloyalty> Mobot bring be Hydro-bot
[1:09:03] <Wildbold> This is such a good pause theme
[1:09:04] <PulverKong> Paige will be lying in the couch eating mustard with a straw for days
[1:09:07] <fredan31> this is my alarm in the morning
[1:09:08] <TheEvilOmega> Like, my last time playing, I decided to steal his sword. Lo and behold, he smites me with his stupid cheating abilities.
[1:09:09] <elementofloyalty> YES
[1:09:16] <Innocuous_Goat> So how about that age swap Persona 5 AU?
[1:09:20] <HanPaul> has Pat ever thought about having "Crazy Talk" as his break music?
[1:09:22] <+ymorn> this song is amazing but her saying shap shifter almist ruins it for me
[1:09:23] <$GohanEgret> @PulverKong so business as usual?
[1:09:42] <elementofloyalty> 'I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP"! - @AngriestPat
[1:09:48] <iambqb> On the whole I like the new translation, but yeah you do miss out on some things
[1:09:50] <PulverKong> I hope our Mustard Queen is ok
[1:10:13] <%JaydenSai> @PulverKong Well Pat did say she's out for a bit, she may come back during the stream
[1:10:17] <elementofloyalty> Peach dumps pat because of grey hair :(
[1:10:23] <+Kiyosuki> Team PPPS
[1:10:25] <WrongFun> @Innocuous_Goat that sounds like it'd involve having to change the entire theme of teh game on it's head. And also that it'd be awful.
[1:10:47] <iambqb> the key to avoid that fate @elementofloyalty is for Pat to go completely bald!
[1:10:54] <elementofloyalty> EGGMAN
[1:11:00] <+ymorn> if paige was gonna dump pat over gray hair theres a half dozen other things she would have slready left for
[1:11:06] <umbypokochan> weird, i've never heard the song get this far
[1:11:10] <kamen_advent> Does Pat need a step ladder to pee standing up?
[1:11:11] <Mr_LupLup> Like his grey pubic hair
[1:11:13] <elementofloyalty> WOW best tune
[1:11:27] <sirrice77> I mean she stayed through the closet candy so
[1:11:29] <elementofloyalty> Pat needs Life Alert bracelet
[1:11:57] <PulverKong> "I have to take a piss" *famous last words*

[1:13:18] <TheEvilOmega> I think Pat might be crazy/

[1:13:42] <CrimsonCore90> Came in for Prime OCD Pat
[1:13:43] <Heyestus> No matter how much you wash you'll never be clean.
[1:13:44] <elementofloyalty> PEDO OLD MAN
[1:13:46] <+Rabbitmage> OCD
[1:13:47] <sirrice77> Stop, you're making super germs
[1:13:48] <AzureDusk> @AngriestPat Pat lets watch UmaMusume on stream
[1:13:48] <TheEvilOmega> Final Fantasy 8 has the best soundtrack, end of discussion.
[1:13:49] <HanPaul> but the box said not to do that WutFace
[1:13:49] <Elexius> Gotta get those worms off.
[1:13:50] <$Zero_Awakening> pat the controller is still dirty from when your hands were dirty tho
[1:13:51] <WhiteRice92> I leave for a minute and come back to this what the fuck
[1:13:51] <%Arazien> And this is why Pat has the liquid poos
[1:13:53] <+TeethMuncher> He just wants to be clean like Danny Devito
[1:13:54] <%jayshackcamel> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[1:13:55] <$radda343> pat you're not supposed to wipe your hands with those
[1:13:55] <elementofloyalty> SCUMMY

[1:13:59] <AirlineFood74> LSO JUST WASH YOUR FUCKING HANDS, YOU'RE WIPING YOUR HANDS WITH ZE DIRTY THING
[1:14:00] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat yo that disinfectant is hell on your skin get yourself some lotion before your hands flake into oblivion
[1:14:01] <iambqb> But now you need to clean the wipe because it touched you
[1:14:02] <+Yeajow> Thats bad for your hands pat
[1:14:05] <$RaikenTB> It will never truly be clean.
[1:14:07] <Innocuous_Goat> And that is basic hygiene. I'm sure this is new to you.
[1:14:08] <elementofloyalty> throw away old controllers
[1:14:08] <+LuckyChocobo> I want to clarify something. I hate this game for one reason, and it's the trash fire that is the Wiegraf fight, that leads straight into a defense chapter where the person you need to protect runs straight into enemies who kill her in one turn.
[1:14:09] <%thefishofwar> apatBig Crazy
[1:14:09] <+Rabbitmage> Now burn your skin with matches
[1:14:11] <GuelermeDias> Pat is trying to clean the age off his skin
[1:14:12] <Zeikier> I hate the feeling of a greasy joystick
[1:14:12] <%Plutt_bug> Dry as Pat's old man dry cummies!
[1:14:17] <%Kay_Tana> The wipe itself gets dirty though.
[1:14:21] <umbypokochan> just burn your skin off
[1:14:22] <elementofloyalty> Dry hands crack
[1:14:26] <$Zero_Awakening> @AngriestPat your dirty hand germs are still on the controller tho....
[1:14:26] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Take it to the bath tub with me?
[1:14:28] <Zeikier> you know what else is bad for your hands? GERMS
[1:14:28] <GuelermeDias> all those dead skin cells
[1:14:29] <Starkwyn47> This is how super viruses are made.
[1:14:30] <+VoxelFoxTwitch> Im the same way pat
[1:14:33] <+Helghast102> stopping in to say happy birthday y'old fuck
[1:14:35] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat and I say that as someone who HATES using lotion
[1:14:36] <$radda343> you're dipping your hands in bleach pat
[1:14:36] <Mr_LupLup> Blowtorch your hands
[1:14:37] <+VoxelFoxTwitch> I wash my hands like every 30 mins
[1:14:40] <+ArcadeTrick> Burn the filth away 4Head
[1:14:41] <%captainthunderwolf> @LuckyChocobo Well that's a bad sequence, though, not an entire bad game.
[1:14:43] <GuelermeDias> they'll never regenerate again now
[1:14:43] <+Nomicro4u> Pat you Ashy as hell
[1:14:44] <PakuV2> Better to respect women with
[1:14:45] <deviljhojho94> moist pat
[1:14:46] <+Bupkis7> You’re the only one who can feel the difference
[1:14:46] <$BenLubar> pat the inside of my black plastic keyboard is yellow how should I clean it
[1:14:47] <@CoalSavoie> You won't land a hand model job like George with that bad habit, pat
[1:14:48] <SovPho> over sanitized hands leads to increased risk of illness
[1:14:50] <Elexius> Is Pat the opposite of Salad Fingers?
[1:14:50] <+JoeStillLife> Pat is an old foot
[1:14:51] <$GohanEgret> what
[1:14:53] <AirlineFood74> YOU CAN OH IDK USE A FUCKING TOWEL
[1:14:53] <Buttku> I bet peach loves your dry hands too
[1:14:54] <%Plutt_bug> Put hands in oven for 45 minutes
[1:14:54] <%Arazien> NOT EVER YOUR OWN SKIN
[1:14:54] <deviljhojho94> Old people need moisture patricio
[1:14:55] <PulverKong> SOLID
[1:14:56] <+EmoLlama> LUL

[1:15:00] <$TenderBabyBacon> That is CRAZY
[1:15:00] <spkenny1> there are certain controllers that dont get all gross over time.
[1:15:01] <umbypokochan> death = clean
[1:15:02] <+drewdrew89> yeah that makes sense
[1:15:02] <+LuckyChocobo> @captainthunderwolf It made me stop playing the game entirely, so it does.
[1:15:04] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Use cocoa butter Pat!!!!
[1:15:05] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat Bacteria love dead flaky skin
[1:15:06] <%Arxel1> Dead = clean
[1:15:06] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat the bacteria get in the dry cracks though
[1:15:06] <elementofloyalty> CLEAN THE HANDS AGAIN
[1:15:09] <%D_day> That does make sense
[1:15:11] <+EmoLlama> get manure on your hands
[1:15:11] <+SamSoulesque> Just get Lotion, man. I work at a Laboratory and have to disinfect my hands like 1000 times per day
[1:15:13] <IminyourBase> gojo or lava soap
[1:15:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Actually dry skin is more easily infected because there are more crevices for the germs to get into
[1:15:15] <Wildbold> Some TURDS
[1:15:15] <vike_me> I wish I did not get that logic. But I do. And I hate myself for that reason.
[1:15:17] <AirlineFood74> THAT'S FUCKING STUPID
[1:15:18] <CrimsonCore90> So why dont you wash your hands afterwords?
[1:15:19] <Innocuous_Goat> You should just get a bottle of hand sanitizer
[1:15:21] <$GohanEgret> what no
[1:15:22] <Spydurman> .....
[1:15:23] <elementofloyalty> WTF

[1:15:28] <+internetexplorer11> don't do that
[1:15:28] <Mr_LupLup> That cant be good

[1:15:37] <$Ponch65> Clean your hands with BURNING
[1:15:38] <%captainthunderwolf> @LuckyChocobo I've eaten walls in games like that brick by brick. You just have an intolerant constitution.
[1:15:38] <Wildbold> YEA THE WHOLE HAND IS GONE
[1:15:38] <+EmoLlama> @rdark_ksu WutFace
[1:15:39] <elementofloyalty> :D

[1:15:41] <+ArcadeTrick> Acid
[1:15:41] <$BenLubar> just dip your hand into magma
[1:15:41] <$ZechHarvey> "This is why my father was never caught for all those murders" said Pat.
[1:15:43] <GuelermeDias> that explains a lot about your ideas
[1:15:44] <fredan31> i worked in a body shop and use paint thinner to cleen my hands

[1:15:52] <elementofloyalty> Crazy Mutha fcka
[1:15:53] <+bittahjuri> For me it was Gasoline
[1:15:55] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Terpentine isn't fucking acid, your hand will be fine.
[1:15:55] <$radda343> I'm convinced your parents raised you wrong on purpose
[1:15:55] <%rdark_ksu> @EmoLlama i stand by my statement
[1:15:56] <+LuckyChocobo> I think I cleared the trash fire Wiegraf chapter, and then died to chocobos, and that's where I dropped this game.
[1:15:57] <IminyourBase> hands are dirty? get new hands
[1:16:00] <+tuesti> how is pat playing this?
[1:16:01] <Spydurman> Hand can't be infected if you chop off your hand *taps forehead*

[1:16:22] <elementofloyalty> Soak yer hands in raw sewage
[1:16:24] <Snirtax> I got a little turpentine in my mouth once. tastes like burning
[1:16:24] <Frozilla15> Brake clean is objectively better
[1:16:27] <$BenLubar> why is the UI asking pat to push the left and right d-pad buttons on his analog stick
[1:16:29] <CurrySauseBandit> Happy Birthday Pat! FeelsBirthdayMan

[1:17:20] <+LuckyChocobo> Gotta get those highly specific skills so you have a chance at beating Wiegraf.
[1:17:21] <Daxalog> Remember the main character gets special Squire Abilites at certain points of the story
[1:17:21] <+bittahjuri> its great in the beginning yeah
[1:17:27] <+Gulping> Okay turn that dude with 70 brave into a squire
[1:17:29] <sirrice77> Where you get amazing weapons BY CATCHING THEM BECAUSE THEY THREW IT AT YOU

[1:18:29] <elementofloyalty> BAIL;
[1:18:31] <+Gulping> You have a dude with seventy brave
[1:18:32] <+LogothX> Magick with a K
[1:18:35] <Zeikier> no pat, cuz as sexism dictates, only ladies are good mages. And Ramza I guess DansGame
[1:18:39] <HanPaul> 69 Brave Kappa
[1:18:40] <+Gulping> Make him squire
[1:18:41] <@CoalSavoie> 5
[1:18:41] <%AbnormalVoid> Kick them all, sell their armor, get a new crew
[1:18:41] <+LogothX> It varies
[1:18:42] <elementofloyalty> Pat is 320 years old
[1:18:42] <Daxalog> I dunno. Im playing through this right now. I still cant get over not having a multi-species clan.
[1:18:42] <umbypokochan> i never use my original people cuz you can't name them stupid things
[1:18:43] <%AnarchyStrider> God the way the text moves it sounds like a cat purring in this game
[1:18:43] <GuelermeDias> like pat has Paige doing groceries for him
[1:18:44] <fredan31> 5
[1:18:45] <lethallunacyx> 5
[1:18:46] <+Gulping> it's 5
[1:18:48] <+LogothX> sometimes its 4, other times its 5
[1:18:51] <elementofloyalty> frive
[1:18:52] <%AbnormalVoid> 5, but it's 4 for most of chapter 1
[1:18:53] <Thalchampz> 4 or 5
[1:18:54] <+LogothX> It depends on the fight
[1:18:55] <PepperDryad> @AngriestPat Remember that if they have higher Faith, not only are they better casters, but ALL magic works more effectively on them. Good or bad.
[1:18:55] <%Arxel1> 4/5
[1:18:56] <Zeikier> the elmo has become Game itself
[1:19:01] <elementofloyalty> 1 1 1 1 1

[1:19:11] <Daxalog> 4-5. The story missions will quickly turn to that to 2-3 ish
[1:19:13] <+Gulping> No you don't
[1:19:18] <+LogothX> Just have all girls
[1:19:20] <Fuji_Apples> is this war of the lions
[1:19:20] <%Macbutters86> Sup you shitlords
[1:19:22] <+TeethMuncher> It takes bravery not to have faith
[1:19:23] <elementofloyalty> Peach is high in luck
[1:19:26] <laserbeaming> Do you want a Bard/dancer?
[1:19:26] <Zeikier> it's always better to have brave as high as possible
[1:19:27] <vonmaultke> !uptime
[1:19:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 19m 36s.
[1:19:30] <+Gulping> There's literally ONE CASE where you want low Brave
[1:19:32] <umbypokochan> girls can use better stuff
[1:19:36] <elementofloyalty> Halstein? Dutch?
[1:19:37] <startadevy> super legit
[1:19:38] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat make physical units dudes, they start with 1 more PA, and women magical units, they start with 1 more magic
[1:19:39] <%clausover> @AngriestPat But it could be higher
[1:19:40] <+Gulping> And that's Move-Find Item
[1:19:41] <Zeikier> yeah, and it's a really stupid reason to get low brave
[1:19:41] <%Macbutters86> playing GoW on hardest difficulty, getting my shit pushed in and love every second of it.
[1:19:49] <+LogothX> Girls can use the ultra rare perfume
[1:19:52] <+LuckyChocobo> Am I crazy, or is this song used in FFXII?
[1:19:53] <+ElarusTheMage> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, hows it going Buddy.
[1:19:54] <+Gulping> So just make Augustine there a Squire
[1:19:56] <Zeikier> I think one recruit gives you someone with low brave so you don't have to waste time on your own dude
[1:19:57] <elementofloyalty> Turn redbull into Piss
[1:20:00] <Zeikier> I think it was...Rafa?
[1:20:02] <@CoalSavoie> Brave is always good, but low faith for your fighters and high faith for your mages
[1:20:04] <+Gulping> Yeah those both suck
[1:20:06] <startadevy> ew
[1:20:07] <MarylandJutsu> MEDIOCRE

[1:20:35] <+TheShal> Two TUFF BOIS

[1:20:41] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat make mages women
[1:20:43] <Zeikier> Consuela Crema
[1:20:43] <+Gulping> we can get better
[1:20:44] <deviljhojho94> The stin duo

[1:31:13] <diiizle> Balbanes sounds way better imo
[1:31:14] <+korth367> barbababoon
[1:31:18] <Zeikier> yeah the WotL translation is a trainwreck in its own right
[1:31:21] <Adamotron> Effing Aeris Aerith nonsense.

[1:31:47] <+SaurianCrash> Delita is a sshole, delete his ass lol
[1:31:50] <Tunykun> Oh man, this brings back so many memories. Algus and Delita are such heroes.
[1:31:53] <Zeikier> rip
[1:31:54] <+ymorn> it seems like a more accurate translation of the katakana
[1:31:58] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat put item on a secondary?
[1:31:59] <Max_Radical> Ramza looks like BOTW Link
[1:32:00] <Zeikier> we get to watch the flashback's flashback again!
[1:32:01] <+Gulping> There's a reason they poisoned him because otherwise he would have fuckin murdered all the bad guys on his own no shit

[1:32:13] <+LogothX> ARGATH!!!!!!
[1:32:13] <%OdysseyKnight> My big problem with these overly flowery translations is it screams of someone desperate to use their major in ye olde English as much as humanly possible even if it sounds worse

[2:20:45] <Prism_Wing> Good thing I don't care about God of War because it's horseshit.
[2:20:47] <SwindlerOfProgress> I actually totally missed that recommended video.
[2:20:48] <Chichen> I just set it up. Someone spoiled something to me by basically shouting a spoiler at me. I'm not even sure if its true or not but BOI was I mad. @AngriestPat

[2:21:02] <%ssjklyco> YOUTUBE: We don't want to notify you of your subscribed channels because we don't want to spam you. Here are some recommended spoilers for your pleasure.
[2:21:06] <Luvinsus> I installed an extension that hides Youtube recommendations two months before Automata came out LUL
[2:21:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I would have assumed that the final boss would be what, Odin?

[2:21:11] <+TheShal> Woolie eats the mic TOO much

[2:21:15] <punkthepsychopenguin> Pat drop your shield
[2:21:16] <wizard_of_diamonds> I couldn't believe who the final boss was. It didn't make any sense when I read it. So many hours later it STILL doesn't make sense

[2:23:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> how strong is your wifu
[2:23:06] <+Ryallen> It took Kratos 7 games to be a good dad, and Kiryu started out loving the child unconditionally and doing everything in his power to keep her safe, that poll is bullshit

[2:23:16] <VirtuaRailith> unless you're going for that super end game bullshit
[2:23:18] <iambqb> You can always beat the base Disgaea experience with minimal grinding
[2:23:21] <+Lt_Campbell> i dont think pat can see his own balls
[2:23:21] <+DomunDomunDomun> Pat feeds his weefees.

[2:36:50] <VirtuaRailith> LIGHTNING RETURNS IS A GOOD GAME WITH A HORRIBLE ENDING
[2:36:51] <+Ryallen> 7 being a favorite isn't really a cliche anymore, since people have more or less decided that 7 isn't that good
[2:36:53] <deviljhojho94> 4 is legendary
[2:36:54] <+Ilpala271> LET PEOPLE HAVE FAVORITES PAIGE
[2:36:54] <urmomgaylooool> 6 OR 9 EZ

[2:36:56] <%HiroTSK5> FF4 ir refined
[2:36:57] <+skizzuto> FF4 is fantastic
[2:36:57] <iambqb> Somebody strawpoll this nonsense
[2:36:58] <laserbeaming> 5 is underrated
[2:37:01] <Xeno351> Chrono Trigger best FF game
[2:37:01] <Agami23> if a game has ATB its shitty
[2:37:02] <Everpresent_Overseer> final fantasy crystal chronicles best final fantasy
[2:37:03] <spartan_ermine> i like XV
[2:37:03] <+filthyheretichorus> 6 is boring
[2:37:04] <deviljhojho94> 6 THEN 4 THEN 9
[2:37:04] <+TheShal> 4 is a great game, but it's not the best Final Fantasy game
[2:37:04] <$Vilecrow> 6 is the best, 7 is over rated
[2:37:05] <parkslady> 9 or 10
[2:37:05] <%lamplight_> I'm so happy to see so many 9's :D

[2:37:07] <Chichen> Pat is egg
[2:37:08] <+NWR_James> what?
[2:37:08] <+Gulping> FIESTA
[2:37:09] <Shinmaddrox> 4 is the first character specific class template. It's not the best. FF6 did it better and 7 did it worse than 6.
[2:37:11] <Spydurman> 4, 6, is this because of your love for the number 12???
[2:37:11] <elementofloyalty> Eggman
[2:37:12] <%vancucci> 4 is a big step in the evolution of the game
[2:37:14] <aversalammar> 13-3 is the best FF game
[2:37:14] <Pappajimbo> I like 12 fight me
[2:37:15] <%Keyd00d> no pat that's the first game
[2:37:17] <ThespianBarrage> 1,6,7, and tactics
[2:37:17] <Graywolf_the_45th> the 13 trilogy is clearly the best
[2:37:17] <Screamlord_Bonerhitler> sodaTHINKING
[2:37:19] <%Jetfandam> yep
[2:37:20] <+fistorage> 4 is kind of eh
[2:37:20] <elementofloyalty> 13
[2:37:21] <alliudmla> I've been very underwhelmed by 4
[2:37:21] <kamen_advent> FF2 is THE WORST
[2:37:22] <SovPho> how dare you 8 is good
[2:37:22] <+Ilpala271> 12 is great, probably my favorite
[2:37:25] <%Keyd00d> 8 is fine
[2:37:25] <reonome> 8 is fine
[2:37:25] <$noteisiger> FF8 is mayo
[2:37:25] <wsintai> 2 is the fucking BEST
[2:37:26] <McDohI> ...whatever
[2:37:26] <tag545> no eggs
[2:37:26] <NBD_Rab> 2 is always the worst
[2:37:27] <%Jetfandam> XIII is fucking garbage!
[2:37:29] <%HiroTSK5> XIII-2 is a great game
[2:37:29] <+Ryallen> 13 isn't bad
[2:37:29] <iambqb> 2 def the worst
[2:37:30] <DeathByPoke7> which 13 Kappa
[2:37:31] <laserbeaming> yeah 2 is the worst
[2:37:31] <%lamplight_> 8 is garbo
[2:37:32] <+FOGSHIE> TRIPLE TRIAD
[2:37:33] <Vroom0> Doesn't Wools hate eggs?
[2:37:33] <%Wrashis> 13 is so by far the worst
[2:37:33] <%ssjklyco> 12 is worst
[2:37:33] <hntronium> Versus 13
[2:37:34] <+Jubelaious> At least 8 is fun to break
[2:37:34] <+Darkblaze53> I liked 13 :u
[2:37:35] <alliudmla> 13 was fine
[2:37:36] <+Gulping> 13 is the worst
[2:37:36] <koidev> I don't like 4. 1-4 are boring imo
[2:37:36] <+I4gotmyname89> 8 is my favorite :(
[2:37:37] <+BoSteed> I'm sorry my favorite Final Fantasy is an overdone meme. I guess I should stop letting it be my favorite because other people said it's theirs. Kappa
[2:37:38] <kamen_advent> You can have fun with 8
[2:37:38] <Mr_LupLup> I like 2 even though it is indeed a bad game
[2:37:40] <+centrilion> I love 9 and 10
[2:37:42] <Mendin> 8s music is aces though
[2:37:43] <wsintai> ALL THESE COWARDS DONT UNDERSTAND HOW PERFECT 2 IS
[2:37:45] <$GohanEgret> 12 is so boring
[2:37:45] <reonome> FUCK YOU PAIGE
[2:37:45] <+gwanzan2> at least 13 is pretty
[2:37:45] <+Tacowavable> 8 has such good music
[2:37:46] <Twoiis> FF8 Gardens were cool.
[2:37:46] <elementofloyalty> Elmo?
[2:37:47] <BizarreRevolver> is type 0 okay?
[2:37:47] <+Bupkis7> BOOYAKA
[2:37:47] <Nitsuj293> 7 Has been ruined buy its garbage fanbase
[2:37:48] <aversalammar> 8 is still fun though
[2:37:49] <McDohI> 13 fanboys exist LuL
[2:37:49] <$Zero_Awakening> 8 was fun... story is a bit weird
[2:37:50] <+reiju_22> 12 ResidentSleeper
[2:37:50] <mrjohncarlton> 8 has very serious flaws but has good points to balance it out somewhat
[2:37:50] <%rdark_ksu> eggs are delicious and one of the most perfect food nutritionally....why are they talking about games?
[2:37:50] <Shinmaddrox> Ivalice is the fucking best. Why no Ivalice MMO?

[3:02:55] <Ell1ot> we do, Pat?
[3:02:55] <Spydurman> no we don't

[3:02:56] <$BoSteed> A lot a lot
[3:02:56] <+Nomicro4u> We watch for Elmo
[3:02:56] <+jorgamund> ...I'm actually here for FFT
[3:02:56] <SovPho> If I want to watch someone play video games, I watch Liam's stream.

[3:03:08] <SurvivalShotgun> !uptime
[3:03:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 3m 17s.
[3:03:08] <+Codemaster7777> Pat is now sad

[3:03:28] <+CommandThrowChavo> You two are the closest we will ever get to live action Always Sunny crew
[3:03:29] <%Keyd00d> I actually did come to see this good game played today
[3:03:30] <elementofloyalty> PEACH PUKES UP BURGERS
[3:03:32] <iambqb> I mean if you look at the amount of clips on the subreddit that are gaming focused vs. the ones that are... this, you get your answer
[3:03:33] <%ssaryn> No, stop the game and keep reading donations telling you how old you are.
[3:03:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i'd watch some freak speedrun it if I wanted mad strats
[3:03:37] <+hobojo153> There's a PSP version of this game?
[3:03:38] <+DomunDomunDomun> ginger seeking butt chomps
[3:03:39] <dakkster> the grind is real
[3:03:41] <NeroInfinite> It's been three hours, and he's only at level 3
[3:03:43] <legendarysabertooth> ROTATE YOUR SAVES
[3:03:46] <Archmortal> Wait... Pat is grinding... in Final Fantasy Tactics?!
[3:03:52] <+Gulping> Pat you gotta get
[3:03:53] <%fredan31> wheres my sub?
[3:03:55] <+crimsonberry255> I want to see them have a traditional Klingon wedding.
[3:03:57] <dorothylane> Damn, now I want salty, greasy, delicious McDonalds food.
[3:03:57] <elementofloyalty> YEA B boy
[3:03:58] <+Gulping> you gotta get JP UP
[3:03:58] <%fredan31> nvm
[3:03:58] <iambqb> Just gotta use that fast forward though
[3:04:01] <+Poco_Ocho> the psp version is good except for the slowdown whenever you cast spells
[3:04:02] <Sloavon> uhnSeat uhnSeat uhnSeat uhnSeat uhnSeat uhnSeat uhnSeat uhnSeat
[3:04:02] <LeeOhX> Is this the one where it starts in a snow place

[3:04:13] <+SimplestJack> HAPPY BIRTHDAY PAT!
[3:04:13] <Zerodeath2> Pat spank her and then put a ring on her finger
[3:04:15] <JackMcStone> "BABA BA BAAA"
[3:04:18] <SurvivalShotgun> Battletech is out this tuesday will you consider checking it out? @AngriestPat
[3:04:19] <+Gulping> happy pat day
[3:04:26] <+hobojo153> @AngriestPat Have you ever played a Disgaea game?
[3:04:27] <blackbaron98> my brother used to annoy tf out of me with this game
[3:04:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> and even then I want him to fail
[3:04:36] <elementofloyalty> Pat is 13 years old and bald.
[3:04:37] <Fat_Gaz> Has pat fought the new monster in monster hunter yet?
[3:04:37] <%ssaryn> JP Boost is basically 75% of the game.
[3:04:41] <%Remery_> Man I grinded so hard in this game.
[3:04:42] <TropicalPsychosis> pat talks about how he doubts that people come to the stream for him, but I think we can all agree that him holding fully half the viewers of the official podcast is fucking impressive for a personal stream
[3:04:51] <%vampireinarm> well, this is ONE way to spend your birthday apatSmug apatSmug
[3:04:52] <RogerPoore> @AngriestPat Please avoid screwing your game of leveling too high for random encounters but not far in the story to upgrade your gear.
[3:04:57] <+crimsonberry255> @Zerodeath2 That is literally the best idea ever FortOne
[3:04:59] <mercado94> adn it was the best
[3:05:05] <+Codemaster7777> mmmmmmm sounds like skillful use of resources
[3:05:08] <runningfleet> no war of the lions?
[3:05:16] <Sitinomi> Rabanastre is still a bitch to do because people can't mechanics
[3:05:19] <elementofloyalty> Peach Chemist is dead already?
[3:05:20] <+Gulping> why mess with perfection
[3:05:29] <+Gulping> This is WotL
[3:05:38] <%ssaryn> That is pretty impressive.
[3:05:39] <elementofloyalty> N EVER
[3:05:40] <%Remery_> Pat is a slutty camgirl
[3:05:41] <+DashXero> Will Pat be using the OP named characters for most battles?
[3:05:43] <CybertronPrime> @sitinomi Only Hashmal, really.
[3:05:43] <SwiftFission> This theme gives me phantasy star vibes
[3:05:46] <+NWR_James> hah
[3:05:46] <%Reaverund> Have some ego
[3:05:47] <elementofloyalty> Modesty
[3:05:48] <+Nomicro4u> What a lie
[3:05:50] <elementofloyalty> Class
[3:05:51] <$GohanEgret> kendrick said be HUMBLE
[3:05:51] <%Paralurx> Pride is the best tho
[3:05:52] <%ssaryn> Pride is for fucking losers.
[3:05:52] <%Remery_> Showing his feet and elbows
[3:05:53] <elementofloyalty> Humble
[3:05:53] <Everpresent_Overseer> rememver pride is a sin
[3:05:54] <+Codemaster7777> I agree with pat
[3:05:55] <Sloavon> be a bitch pat
[3:05:55] <%ziriken> Humility gives you the bigger dick
[3:05:55] <missingangle> It totally is. Humility makes you less of a butthole
[3:05:57] <SwindlerOfProgress> I mean...
[3:05:57] <+Samori79> tis true
[3:05:59] <+crimsonberry255> NO HUMILITY FOR BIRFDAY BOI
[3:05:59] <+LogothX> yep
[3:05:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> He's humble when the feat is actually impressive
[3:06:03] <+jorgamund> but JP is more important than humility OR pride
[3:06:03] <%a_lucky_soul> we love our stream dad
[3:06:04] <runningfleet> you can make the generics OP pretty easy
[3:06:04] <%Jetfandam> truth
[3:06:05] <%cerberuscarmine> peach has big pride
[3:06:05] <+Nomicro4u> Humility is for cowards
[3:06:06] <+Codemaster7777> The ways of the coward
[3:06:06] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Gotta be a dummy if you wanna get those cummies
[3:06:07] <+hobojo153> Let's see how Paige can fuck herself with this one
[3:06:08] <+Bloodxb> pride is literally the gravest ain
[3:06:08] <aversalammar> Lust is better than Pride
[3:06:08] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat Happy Birthday you glorious bastard! and welcome back @peachsaliva reaper slayer
[3:06:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the prerec streams only get like 600
[3:06:09] <mercado94> im with pat also
[3:06:10] <+Manbearpigbear> What happened to the pat that embodied all the sins?
[3:06:11] <Zerodeath2> @Crimsonberry255 right greatest proposal pat could do
[3:06:11] <+C_Gaiden> Pat putting Vegeta on blast
[3:06:13] <+DelNoche> the backdown
[3:06:15] <%rdark_ksu> pride is acceptable but pride-fullness is a no go
[3:06:15] <%ssaryn> That's VERY TRUE.
[3:06:16] <AzureKayZ> I'd bang a Chocobo
[3:06:20] <+gwanzan2> Pat is so proud of his humility
[3:06:21] <%Noahccountingfortaste> cheer500 Happy birthday Pat. Don't let it set in. Also, way to survive, Paige!
[3:06:22] <Dairaipie> otuThink otuThink otuThink otuThink

[3:06:27] <%ssaryn> Only slightly tho.
[3:06:28] <%ziriken> Self-Cest confirmed

[3:06:34] <+Proposition__Joe> you need some pride, just make sure not to over level your pride
[3:06:36] <dakkster> It always made me mad that the red panthers are not red
[3:06:38] <deviljhojho94> huh
[3:06:38] <prismaticsnake> so a bigger dick?
[3:06:39] <elementofloyalty> Pats big cock makes up for his lack of humanity
[3:06:40] <mtgtin> WOW
[3:06:41] <Schuhart> @AzureKayZ You and me both
[3:06:41] <Prevot> RIP Pat
[3:06:41] <Slim_Lipid> Pride is a sin
[3:06:42] <Spydurman> slightly LUL
[3:06:43] <+mikesniderman> humility is whack with no pride
[3:06:43] <%ssaryn> Paige is very proud about eating Poison Glass and eating Wcdonalds for a living.
[3:06:46] <missingangle> I didn't expect him to actually quote me on that. I will say, nothing wrong with being proud of yourself. But you need a balance between the two, honestly.
[3:06:48] <elementofloyalty> :O Who's talking?
[3:06:48] <+Gulping> hahahaha
[3:06:49] <+crimsonberry255> @Zerodeath2 Put it in a hamburger, and when she checks it for worms, finds the ring?
[3:06:52] <$GohanEgret> TODD COWARD
[3:06:52] <Sitinomi> @CybertronPrime Oh, I wish. I have had runs where an alliance can't make the DPS check with Rofocale
[3:06:53] <%Jetfandam> be humble Paige
[3:06:53] <+jorgamund> @AngriestPat you're basically saying the difference between Americans and Canadians
[3:06:53] <+SpectralShot> LUL
[3:06:54] <JackMcStone> "HUMBLE"
[3:06:54] <Aleate> Paige has a sense of pride and accomplishment :D
[3:06:54] <%Paralurx> "...and you valued being a loser or whatever"
[3:06:55] <+mikesniderman> pride my niggas

[3:07:07] <vonmaultke> pride goes before a fall paige
[3:07:09] <+Gulping> Oh dear I think pat's dead
[3:07:10] <Everpresent_Overseer> Paige is brimming with Sin, while Pat is pure with virtue
[3:07:10] <+Nomicro4u> So grinding actually did hurt you
[3:07:12] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat peach needs to meet iron sheik so he can MAKE HER HUMBLE!!!!
[3:07:15] <elementofloyalty> EATI9NG
[3:07:15] <Pappajimbo> Americans do love some pride
[3:07:20] <runningfleet> grinding in this game is bad
[3:07:20] <%ssaryn> Very blurry.
[3:07:21] <+Rahlyn> Hey Pat, play the game
[3:07:23] <%ziriken> Look at it eat that mustard

[3:07:47] <CybertronPrime> @sitinomi Jeez. I've only ever had issues with people panicking during Hashmal and the occasional not understanding how Argath works.
[3:07:48] <$BoSteed> Better than the Chrono Trigger PC filter
[3:07:48] <elementofloyalty> Peach has burgers.

[3:28:18] <birchpeninsula> That's not a furry, paige, isn't that an otherkin?
[3:28:34] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Speaking of furries, remember that time on Twitter when that furry artist went around asking FGC people what their favorite animals was and made fursonas for them?

[3:28:38] <$SGrim> @jameszenoa those suit are egregiously expensive. The waste of money unnerves me. Also, I don;t like large crowds of touchy people, and I've found furries have differing definitions of personal space from my experience.
[3:28:38] <%jameszenoa> ive never seen some diaper furry fuck out in public, every furry i've met is a totally chill person (and they arent all gay)

[3:37:56] <+GrayFox2510> He draws way too much furry to not be.
[3:37:56] <misterspotswood> its not furry if plague draws it
[3:37:57] <@thenefftw> He's totally a not-furry
[3:37:57] <Schuhart> Furryism is a sliding scale
[3:37:57] <+bittahjuri> plague will fuck anything
[3:37:57] <+Nomicro4u> Not a furry just draws sexy anthros
[3:37:58] <roada_rolla_da> Plague is ambiguously a furry
[3:37:58] <$GohanEgret> Plague just IS. For he is he.
[3:37:59] <elementofloyalty> NOOOOOOOoooo
[3:38:01] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Oh yeah, Plague does a LOT of furry stuff
[3:38:02] <sirrice77> Plague doesn't claim to be but he sure draws a lot of furry stuff
[3:38:03] <Twoiis> I don't know the definition of a furry.
[3:38:03] <%rdark_ksu> I LOVE THE STAR TREK THING
[3:38:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you can be a furry and not be a dressup style furry
[3:38:05] <Skrist> Woolie and Plague are both the worlds BIGGEST furries
[3:38:06] <PainfulAlternatingCurrent> Woolie and Plague in the Hot Zone
[3:38:07] <Das_Beergut> Shortstacks > Furries
[3:38:10] <WHMBoar> not all furries have fursonas.

[3:47:09] <%ziriken> Go in. Keep Going In. NEVER STOP Goin IN
[3:47:13] <+LogothX> make ramza monk early game
[3:47:14] <fallacy8> Get to accumulate then go to knight and archer
[3:47:15] <hntronium> Jealous of Better Pat
[3:47:17] <Derkinstacker> On the PSP get Dark knight.
[3:47:18] <+bittahjuri> Change Paige to a Black Mage
[3:47:22] <fallacy8> and jp up
[3:47:26] <%Gogogolem> I've literally never touched this game
[3:47:27] <Thalchampz> i'd level chemist to get the mages
[3:47:29] <Valkyrjsen> Ramza Squire is the best. He gets to equip knight stuff eben as Squire.
[3:47:30] <SpookyBeef7> As in what to upgrade them into?
[3:47:32] <%RAWKPARTEE> I always go night after John boost.
[3:47:37] <@StridentSong> @angriestpat Squire: Focus, Stone, Counter Tackle, JP Boost, Move +1 for everyone.
[3:47:37] <elementofloyalty> :D
[3:47:38] <+Jubelaious> Get the funny dual wield brawler punch combo
[3:47:40] <%Gogogolem> I was 2 when it was relased
[3:47:42] <+Jubelaious> Punch the men
[3:47:43] <PepperDryad> I try to get a monk, a wizard and a white mage asap, and ramza to max squire
[3:47:45] <+jorgamund> always a full blown Chemist, plus an Archer
[3:47:46] <mr_gentleman96> @AngriestPat ANy idea if a Into the Breach stream gonna come? Seems like itd be fun? Unless im super wrong

[3:47:47] <wsintai> @AngriestPat Grind every class to max
[3:47:48] <PepperDryad> and a couple knights
[3:47:48] <kayamek> You need a woman blcak mage and just leave her for great magic attack gain
[3:47:48] <AlasterAngelo> Monk and Knight are the best
[3:47:51] <+dontbethinkingthat> Pat, I'm not crazy about Final Fantasy Tactics but I love seeing you and Paige interact. This is a good stream.
[3:47:56] <Klefth> Just follow your heart, Pat enbKiss
[3:47:58] <%clausover> @AngriestPat if you get chemist and squire to 6 you get onion knight
[3:47:59] <+Winnosh> You don't need to level squire till late game for Ramza. Most of the good Ramza stuff comes from being able to use better gear.
[3:48:04] <%Remery_> Become a Geomancer @AngriestPat <3
[3:48:05] <BaslerJones> @AngriestPat why is the latest tbf videos getting so little views ?

[3:53:35] <Mottyrob> @Bouldus have you seen the Primitive Technology youtube Channel? He's cool
[3:53:36] <fallacy8> What other games rip off FF tactics well?

[3:53:37] <vingadivo> not true at all
[3:53:55] <+Jimboq> your lack of talent distinguishes you though pat

[3:54:02] <@Velyndra> bday250 Is this game loss
[3:54:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @angriestpat it is possible to essentially have a yeast infection in your stomach, which converts sugars you consume into alcohol which makes you drunk
[3:54:06] <PortableBoredom> My favourite thing about this game was that the most efficient method of grinding was to clear an area of all but one monster, and then just have your friends beat the shit out of each other and heal each other for JP and EXP
[3:54:10] <elementofloyalty> scat
[3:54:19] <vonmaultke> Its a skill from years of practice, not talent really

[3:55:18] <mr_slaide> What about the bad titty?
[3:55:18] <Bouldus> boooo
[3:55:19] <HatingSince87> tricks on you! I watch the stream with x-ray specs!!!
[3:55:19] <SwindlerOfProgress> Pretty sure you have tits, Paige.
[3:55:22] <%ThatGuyfromMars> MAYBE She just has one big tit that she has to use a two boob bra for
[3:55:23] <Ell1ot> I thought the lore was that people watch Paige's streams for her feet and ankles
[3:55:24] <@Velyndra> bday250 is this stream loss

[3:55:31] <+TeethMuncher> My liver failed only once!
[3:55:33] <%MisterCrimson> Paige's audience is mainly Lupus ridden drug witches with mustard addictions
[3:55:33] <The_Blumper> Most of them are Bots
[3:55:34] <+Jimboq> it depends on the lifestyle
[3:55:35] <blackbaron98> but i wanna

[3:57:57] <GalaxyGirlChel> awww paige eats ice like i do
[3:57:58] <GurrenPrime> some fortnite chucklefuck
[3:57:58] <$noteisiger> remember that time a guy pirate streamed MMA by pretending he was playing an MMA game on PS4
[3:57:59] <Bouldus> some fuck wit
[3:58:03] <GurrenPrime> he looks like a cunt
[3:58:04] <GalaxyGirlChel> good trash mom
[3:58:09] <$SGrim> @LogothX Fortnite streamer specializing in 12 year old viewers
[3:58:09] <mr_slaide> DO IT, NERD.
[3:58:10] <cjsugar> Paige likes Ice, confirmed.
[3:58:11] <%D_day> Former Halo player Ninja
[3:58:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> ninja is apparently the pewdiepie of twitch
[3:58:15] <Bouldus> dyes his hair green iirc
[3:58:16] <$OmegaWeltall> i NEVER heard of Ninja before that Drake/Fortnite shit
[3:58:20] <+AntithesisEK> Ninja was a comp. Halo player for a long time before fortnite hit hard.
[3:58:20] <GurrenPrime> but pewdiepie knows his old content was cancer
[3:58:20] <Bouldus> or shome shit
[3:58:23] <Bouldus> some*
[3:58:24] <%ziriken> @SGrim so a fortnite streamer
[3:58:24] <mr_slaide> So he's a loud moron?
[3:58:25] <@Velyndra> bday250 is this donation loss
[3:58:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> basically everyone loves him for no apparent reason
[3:58:27] <GurrenPrime> this ninja guy is raking in thousands
[3:58:29] <MrDonTacos_> LuL
[3:58:32] <+Sycada> Damn people hate him because he blew up huh?
[3:58:35] <$Chimeraelite> internet is a big place dude
[3:58:39] <+LogothX> god battle royake
[3:58:45] <GurrenPrime> he makes a lot of fucking money
[3:58:48] <elementofloyalty> sneaking on ginger toes
[3:58:48] <%BeardedLuchador> People are just haters
[3:58:49] <Valkyrjsen> Thousands? I heard the Ninja dude literally is a millionaire.
[3:58:51] <$SGrim> @ziriken hey, some specialize in 8 year old viewers. Give them the credit they deserve: none.
[3:58:52] <Bouldus> @Sycada nah shit talking is jsut fun
[3:58:52] <+LogothX> battle royale is a plague
[3:59:03] <GurrenPrime> if someone killed him on stream yesterday then won the game, they got atleast 7k
[3:59:09] <%ziriken> @SGrim agreed
[3:59:13] <elementofloyalty> but...
[3:59:14] <GurrenPrime> its absurd
[3:59:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> RIIIIGHT
[3:59:17] <%BeardedLuchador> Kappa I feel like the only people who have such a disdain for BR games don't have friends to play them with
[3:59:23] <+AntithesisEK> but when they do, people go missing.
[3:59:25] <%Remery_> Gingers have low resistance stats?
[3:59:25] <%BeardedLuchador> otherwise it's harmless
[3:59:27] <+BoboDaHobo> the Chris chan documentary guy?
[3:59:37] <GurrenPrime> when every game ever tries to shove it in thats when it becomes a problem
[3:59:40] <@Velyndra> bday1000 am I loss?
[3:59:43] <davidsanchan> so not shy around pat fo sure
[3:59:44] <%BeardedLuchador> sure, but it's not every game
[3:59:45] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:47] <$Yakobro> oh no
[3:59:47] <GurrenPrime> like paladins really didnt need a br mode, call of duty doesnt need a br mode
[3:59:48] <elementofloyalty> HIds behind that phat booty
[3:59:49] <+HansOnMe> Who is Satch?
[3:59:51] <vingadivo> paige shy?
[3:59:55] <+superchronicc> peach the baby
[3:59:58] <%jameszenoa> satchbag drakes
[4:00:00] <%jameszenoa> hes dope
[4:00:02] <+tigerfang86> lmaoooo
[4:00:02] <GurrenPrime> so many games are going to shove it in now that lootboxes are dead
[4:00:08] <MarylandJutsu> PAIGE BIG CRY
[4:00:11] <%BeardedLuchador> Did Yakuza or GoW shove in a BR mode?
[4:00:13] <$SGrim> @Remery_ they over-speced into opioids DarkMode
[4:00:16] <umbypokochan> why must i cry why must i cry why
[4:00:17] <mr_slaide> TAILWIND
[4:00:22] <+ElarusTheMage> Omg, I would love to meet Patton Oswalt.
[4:00:22] <%BeardedLuchador> 🤔 then maybe it's not so much of a trend to be afraid of
[4:00:23] <+superchronicc> paige crying boatloads
[4:00:25] <jotabranded> i love this game so much, thanks for the stream Pat
[4:00:26] <GurrenPrime> no because those are single player games
[4:00:29] <elementofloyalty> Too lates
[4:00:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> too late!
[4:00:32] <+AntithesisEK> higurashi when peach cries
[4:00:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't see any problem with all games having a goofy battle royale mode
[4:00:33] <%BeardedLuchador> Just saying
[4:00:38] <Prevot> Yakuza Dead Souls Battle Royale LUL
[4:00:41] <Valkyrjsen> Paige only likes to look like an asshole on the internet. Not in person!
[4:00:45] <GurrenPrime> but call of duty retroactively putting in a br mode into an already released call of duty game is retarded
[4:00:47] <%BeardedLuchador> Just because battle royale is popular doesn't mean you should just hate on it for its popularity
[4:00:47] <Bouldus> are people not allowed to not like battle royale games?
[4:00:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cute
[4:00:51] <+superchronicc> battle royale seems like a phase
[4:00:51] <Hispanacomida25> Tailwind is kind of eh
[4:00:53] <umbypokochan> i met matt and woolie and i'm pretty sure i seemed like a complete weirdo
[4:00:55] <%BeardedLuchador> Sure but that's CoD being stupid
[4:00:57] <+filthyheretichorus> @BeardedLuchador fucking BR apologist
[4:00:59] <bendatron> @AngriestPat sorry im 3 hours late pat i forgot you went live
[4:01:09] <GurrenPrime> the hate should be directed towards comapnies falling for the trend
[4:01:10] <%Remery_> Just give me a For Honor Battle Royale
[4:01:13] <Prevot> LUL
[4:01:14] <$Yakobro> LOL
[4:01:15] <MrDonTacos_> LuL
[4:01:15] <GurrenPrime> when it doesnt even make sense

[4:01:24] <Valkyrjsen> DO IT COWARD
[4:01:25] <%BeardedLuchador> @filthyheretichorus 🤔 nope, just apathetic enough to question why people care about something they don't like so much

[4:21:11] <spamtrash> Female to Summoner (to dodge charm). Male to Archer to Thief to Ninja - can use daggers - female Thieves do a lot of work stealing hearts early in the game. Male to Knight and Monk then to Goon to make a Samurai. Monks are stupid strong if you two-hand Hamedo Teleport. Time Mage is great support until you get a Samurai. Raise a Red Chocobo. This is assuming you don't want to min-max or use crazy bastards like Mustadio or Agrias or just make all women to exploit the perfumes.

[4:38:20] <%MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat but it did Pat, it's called FF12
[4:38:21] <b0bm3h> No spiritual successor in tactics advance A@ grimoire?
[4:38:21] <Golgo16> Tactics Advance is not a sequel whatsoever, fun games, but yeah
[4:38:21] <+TheShal> FFXII
[4:38:22] <%ssjklyco> But it's canon
[4:38:24] <$noteisiger> well now I know, mindreader
[4:38:24] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Tactics games suck

[4:39:00] <yodajr99> pat porks himself LUL
[4:39:01] <mr_zombiefetish> GBA THO
[4:39:02] <Zerodeath2> Pat and paige are the best kind of crazy
[4:39:02] <Sokumotanaka> All the fire emblem awakening money should have went into games like this
[4:39:04] <Minorou> I too like to wield a pizza cutter sword
[4:39:04] <$HeavyMettle> tactics advance sucked. I HATE the judges. The games were already mediocre and the judges make them garbage tier
[4:39:05] <startadevy> NIOH was ok
[4:39:06] <b0bm3h> Pat tries so hard to not look like a furry, so he hates on tactics advance
[4:39:06] <damienlunas> I played it a couple years ago for the first time, and it is just so full of JRPG clunk
[4:39:06] <$dotta5> swing that pork sword
[4:39:09] <elementofloyalty> PUSS YEAST
[4:39:11] <%PatNTheHat> Maximum Porkverdrive
[4:39:13] <+JingKaisean> @AngriestPat is the Nikana/Dragon Nikana worth getting?
[4:39:14] <davidsanchan> You don't eat your own brand?
[4:39:18] <damienlunas> like the system of having to equip your usable items
[4:39:20] <Valask> bulldog subs? I thought I was free of you fucks here
[4:39:20] <+TheShal> Bread comes from the VAGINA
[4:39:26] <SeruraRenge> @angriestpat WAIT HOLD UP PAT, THIS GAME DID GET A SEQUEL, IT WAS VAGRANT STORY

[4:39:34] <elementofloyalty> Meow
[4:39:43] <+shinpete> After seeing the mustard footage, I thought Paige only ate things that were gross admiral6
[4:39:44] <$HeavyMettle> @damienlunas that sounds more like you don't like old games. That is a totally different complaint. Reminds me of when people say ff7 is worse than ff10 cuz ff10 had better graphiocs
[4:39:48] <elementofloyalty> Cats Stevens
[4:39:48] <Thalchampz> it's Bagel
[4:39:52] <Darren716> Bagel
[4:39:53] <Bouldus> cats look kinda badass with a mising eye
[4:39:54] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Give that a eyepatch and a boat.
[4:39:54] <Graxe_> Man, I just remembered that Balthier's recruitable in War of the Lions due to magical time shenanigans.
[4:39:55] <+wispernrain> yay Bagel!
[4:39:56] <+rcand9> george lucas should make a sequel to fft so ramza can drug agrais real good
[4:39:58] <Klefth> She tallk English good.
[4:39:59] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> cat a*
[4:40:04] <DatAsuna> is FFT advance the same canon,or?
[4:40:13] <Darren716> I just realized Bagel is kinda like alt-universe Elmo

[4:40:17] <+TeethMuncher> A youboober
[4:40:21] <%BeardedLuchador> Jake Paul invited Paige to hang out? Kappa

[4:40:35] <hntronium> THEY ALREADY KNOW PAIGE
[4:40:36] <AttentionPelican> I know this is WoTL but what is Pat playing this on?
[4:40:38] <%Remery_> So Shy
[4:40:39] <hntronium> THAT YOU'RE LAME
[4:40:39] <Darren716> Both are broken cats who crash streams run by lpers
[4:40:41] <SeruraRenge> PAT THIS GAME DID GET A SEQUEL IN TERMS OF PLOT, THE GAME WAS VAGRANT STORY AND TAKES PLACE AFTER FFT
[4:40:41] <roada_rolla_da> Is it Vsauce
[4:40:42] <%BeardedLuchador> They're just trying to get into Pat's pants Kappa
[4:40:42] <+shinpete> Ya'll mothafuckas dumb it's all about the Logang LUL
[4:40:43] <+LowBatteryLife> There is an F+ episode featuring a very unpleasant document about yeast. If you go looking for it, that's on you.
[4:40:46] <+rcand9> dadof5?
[4:40:47] <elementofloyalty> GRIND
[4:40:48] <KingOfTheGeats> oh yea that fight
[4:40:48] <Sloavon> Jack Atlas?
[4:40:50] <rosemon5001> PREGGOS
[4:40:52] <Bouldus> oh shit imagine Paige is on the H3H3 podcast Kappa
[4:40:53] <Golgo16> Good luck with Dorter, always hate this mission

[4:40:54] <%clausover> oh god dorter slum
[4:40:55] <%ziriken> Paige isn't autistic enough for OneyPlays, and i fuckin love oneyplays
[4:40:57] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat Just don't talk about your love of mustard.
[4:41:00] <TrubbleBass> Clemps?
[4:41:00] <pennykettle_> @Bouldus that would be great
[4:41:03] <Sokumotanaka> I did that too pat no worries
[4:41:03] <%clausover> fuck the archers
[4:41:05] <elementofloyalty> BEST IMPRESSION
[4:41:07] <davidsanchan> Paige on did you know gaming about undertale but with no script
[4:41:12] <+Tokanova> i wanna see woolie, woolies gf, paige, and pat hanging out lmao
[4:41:13] <+Skatedeandre> THE MASTER OF FASTER?
[4:41:14] <Bouldus> @pennykettle_ i think it would be a good show
[4:41:15] <DatAsuna> hanging out with a youtuber?
[4:41:18] <DatAsuna> sounds lame
[4:41:20] <$HeavyMettle> oh, this is the psp version? The mobile version is a port of this one but they fixed the slow down on skills @AngriestPat
[4:41:22] <dsauce999> Marquis!
[4:41:23] <+shinpete> tHE mar QU is
[4:41:23] <elementofloyalty> amrquis de sade
[4:41:26] <%Remery_> Feels so good being big and strong in this game and your Lancers are Divebombing people like Aranea in FF15
[4:41:28] <damienlunas> Yeah but there's a lot of JRPGs where you don't have to equip items to use them. It's just an annoyance and a kind of pointless departure from convention. Then there's stuff like 2 prompts in the entire game being time sensitive with no indication, and no other prompts in the game following that convention
[4:41:29] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat THANK YOU PAIGE!!!!
[4:41:33] <%ziriken> ITS MARKEE
[4:41:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[4:41:39] <sirrice77> both are correct
[4:41:39] <+LowBatteryLife> Vagrant Story is hundreds of years in the future, that doesn't really count.
[4:41:39] <ink_dino> Mark of Krithis kills the Paige
[4:41:40] <elementofloyalty> MARQUIS DE SADE
[4:41:40] <$dotta5> tweet H3, get elmo on the podcast
[4:41:41] <%BeardedLuchador> You're not crazy, Final Fantasy is the crazy one
[4:41:41] <%GeneSlamm> It's pronounced Gaskwang Paige
[4:41:41] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat FINAL FANTASY IS WRONG ITS MAR KEY
[4:41:42] <Graxe_> Both pronunciations are correct, if I recall.
[4:41:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> its a french word tho
[4:41:44] <Bouldus> it is markee
[4:41:45] <damienlunas> And one of those prompts being required to get the best ending
[4:41:45] <ink_dino> *Mark of Kri
[4:41:46] <+shinpete> @ziriken it's actualy marquis
[4:41:46] <TrubbleBass> Was it Marquis plier/
[4:41:47] <dsauce999> paige is crazy
[4:41:48] <MelBrooksKA> I believe it is pronounced either way
[4:41:49] <+koagz> you're not crazy, they're wrong
[4:41:50] <sirrice77> No its both correct
[4:41:51] <Sloavon> @Skatedeandre thank you
[4:41:51] <+Exyoh> It's the dumb British pronunciation.
[4:41:51] <+DrBunn> MARK-KEE. I use it as a reagent in my lab daily
[4:41:52] <+ymorn> The english say Mar quiss
[4:41:53] <yodajr99> DJ MARKY MARK
[4:41:56] <SurvivalShotgun> MARQUIS
[4:42:01] <Narsoma> its Japinglish
[4:42:02] <+rcand9> english peolple say marqwis
[4:42:02] <%clausover> Its both
[4:42:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> 420 blaze it
[4:42:06] <AMajorTom> On earth its mar-key, but on this planet, it's not
[4:42:07] <dsauce999> Baller's gate
[4:42:07] <hntronium> BALDR IS GAY
[4:42:08] <+filthyheretichorus> its mar-key
[4:42:09] <davidsanchan> 420 no scope baldur's gate blazing it
[4:42:10] <OspreySoul> Why do I feel like Paige and Jenna Marbles would get along well?
[4:42:12] <ink_dino> Markwain
[4:42:14] <elementofloyalty> Jean Claude Van Damme
[4:42:16] <%AdamRomanus> Marquis is pronounced mark-ee in real life! FF is just doing a thing.
[4:42:17] <Heyestus> MarQUIS is a nobleman MarKEE is a big tent
[4:42:18] <+Skatedeandre> @sloavon no problem friend
[4:42:30] <TrubbleBass> i'm English and I say mar-kee ?
[4:42:34] <$HeavyMettle> @damienlunas the times in the game where you have to make a dialogue choice on an invisible timer, are not affected by the choice. They are just there to create the suspense. Also the difficulty of the game would be broken if you had access to your entire inventory.
[4:42:35] <pennykettle_> Yea, we americans all make big goofy thumbs up at ourselfs
[4:42:42] <MelBrooksKA> "The form “marquis” is French in origin and pronounced substantially “mar-KEY.” The English form is “marquess” and pronounced “mar-kwiss.”"
[4:42:48] <sparrrow_> this fight is notoriously hard Pat
[4:42:49] <%Arazien> Final Fantasy can't even pronounce TIDE-US correctly. You expect them to get Marquis right?
[4:42:52] <startadevy> golden week
[4:42:56] <startadevy> LOL
[4:42:57] <Zerodeath2> Pat and paige are the best kind of crazy i love u guys
[4:43:08] <yodajr99> marquis de leon
[4:43:09] <Bouldus> wait Paige do you know octopimp?
[4:43:09] <FIame> I've never heard anyone say markwis before
[4:43:14] <%ziriken> Just hit them harder
[4:43:14] <SurvivalShotgun> weigraf's boss fight later on is the most infamous boss fight ever
[4:43:14] <FIame> tessSHRUG
[4:43:14] <+Nomicro4u> and now you will be stuck on it as an adult
[4:43:17] <%Plutt_bug> Pat you are still a child, you know it.
[4:43:17] <%BeardedLuchador> octoFRE
[4:43:19] <%MisterCrimson> Marquis Mark and the Funquis Bunch?
[4:43:19] <Golgo16> This stage is why I loved having a Gameshark for PS1 >.>
[4:43:24] <%AdamRomanus> When I was a kid this battle was impossible.
[4:43:27] <OspreySoul> You're both super pretty and you both ADORE your pets and crazy boys.
[4:43:30] <$noteisiger> Danger Zone
[4:43:33] <Bouldus> @MisterCrimson gg wp
[4:43:35] <Bouldus> :D
[4:43:38] <@CoalSavoie> I got stuck on this fight as a child because I hadn't figured out how to change job classes at this point and SOMEHOW beat it with a team of squires and chemists.
[4:43:39] <+MedicalMechanicas> The fight that made me quit that game was the two part one involving a courtyard
[4:43:39] <$HeavyMettle> @AngriestPat I never change how I pronounce the names in this game. I still say ram-zah and way-grahf. This city was always easy for me because I liked fighting so I did random battles before doing it.
[4:43:41] <%Remery_> Yea this first fight made me grind in this game so hard
[4:43:42] <WHMBoar> This fight is so fucked because all of the enemies are given infinite range
[4:43:45] <$dotta5> Jerry came too
[4:43:48] <$HeavyMettle> One time I had a lancer before I did dorter trade city lol
[4:43:50] <+rcand9> archers suck late on
[4:43:51] <AttentionPelican> I mean, I think the Mages are more dangerous unless you can one shot them
[4:44:00] <SeruraRenge> @AngriestPat Pat you said this game has no sequel but Vagrant Story was actually the story sequel, it just has completely different gameplay.
[4:44:01] <sparrrow_> ya their range gets buffed by the difference in height
[4:44:01] <Prevot> FF pronunciation? what about 🤔 AERITH 🤔
[4:44:17] <$HeavyMettle> @MedicalMechanicas riovanes castle is what you are talking of. 1v1 with weigraf and a full team fight
[4:44:26] <sparrrow_> it can be helpful to give the guest characters white magic as a secondary
[4:44:27] <Fathuran> This is the level that always killed me as a kid. Those black mages get things real.
[4:44:35] <+Winnosh> Paige has a guy she killed as her theme?
[4:44:35] <TrubbleBass> It's Ares, Cloud was in love with the former God of War
[4:44:36] <GalaxyGirlChel> lol I just got an ad about doing makup on the stream
[4:44:37] <%Remery_> Wait your ringtone isn't a guy eating a sandwich at a foodcourt?
[4:44:37] <+JavaManJoJo> Might as well change it now that Papyrus is dead
[4:44:39] <babblingcabbage> When's final fantasy tactics battle royale
[4:44:39] <%AdamRomanus> YOU’RE COOL PAIGE NO BONES ABOUT IT
[4:44:40] <elementofloyalty> Drugs make Peach strong
[4:44:44] <blackorchidKI2> I've got that New Challenger theme from Tekken 4 as my ringtone.
[4:44:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> JEALOUS
[4:44:46] <Valkyrjsen> Pat's ringtone should be "Song That Might Play When You Fight Sans".
[4:44:46] <$SGrim> @Prevot you mean Aeris, pronounced like Heiress. DarkMode
[4:44:46] <+hoenhime344> pat should play more god of war
[4:44:49] <blackorchidKI2> It's good shit
[4:44:58] <GalaxyGirlChel> pat, the ads are telling you to be the magical girl you are
[4:45:06] <Zeikier> my text noise is currently the success jingle from Lisa the Painful
[4:45:08] <elementofloyalty> AHGUSTAS
[4:45:09] <MelBrooksKA> My ringtone is "You're phone is ringing, check to see if it's the devil!"
[4:45:13] <%ziriken> ballgas, also known as vega
[4:45:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but in japanese it's pronounced "aerisu"
[4:45:15] <+Superstarsage> ARRRRRRGUS
[4:45:20] <Sypheck> I have the Nier:Automata email sound as my phone notifications, it's perfect

[4:45:25] <GalaxyGirlChel> aaarrrghuuusss
[4:45:26] <Valkyrjsen> I can see that. Algus in japan-speak would sound like ARUGASSU.
[4:45:28] <WHMBoar> YEEEEAH. Five damage
[4:45:30] <elementofloyalty> MARKEE
[4:45:35] <bendatron> @AngriestPat i bought xenogears thanks to you and im loving it
[4:45:37] <elementofloyalty> MARKEE GOD DAM IT
[4:45:41] <SurvivalShotgun> marquis just like ffxii teached us
[4:45:45] <+Winnosh> When will they put out an FF5 game with Ex-Death properly translated to Exodus.
[4:45:49] <Zeikier> I dont think it's "supposed to be" so much as "what they wanted it to sound like to line up with FF12"
[4:45:52] <Graxe_> Argath is so infamous, they brought him back as the final boss in the Rabanastre 24-man.
[4:45:55] <TrubbleBass> >Peach used mustard gas
[4:45:58] <GalaxyGirlChel> @elementofloyalty right!? it's royally irking me
[4:46:02] <TrubbleBass> >It was super effective!
[4:46:05] <+TeethMuncher> Marquis?
[4:46:07] <CybertronPrime> Every time I see Argath I'm reminded of his lines in FFXIV. "THE GODS HAVE NO EYES FOR CHATTEL!"
[4:46:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> MARCOOS
[4:46:11] <%Dingus_Tickler> Balack Magicks
[4:46:13] <$BoSteed> Obviously it's pronounced "Marquis" Kappa
[4:46:15] <%Remery_> Just putting your hands in the air like you just dont care
[4:46:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> FIRE
[4:46:18] <$HeavyMettle> I hate algus so much.
[4:46:20] <elementofloyalty> FIRE IS BLESSING
[4:46:27] <TheMeromex> befor the stream ends i recomend you guys see the musical "rock and rule" its one of my favorites, just youtube the sing "my name is Mok"

[4:46:37] <GalaxyGirlChel> so high very wow
[4:46:39] <%ssaryn> BIG AND STRONG
[4:46:47] <MelBrooksKA> You can say either, the French say "Mar-key", English say "Mar-qwiss"
[4:46:47] <sparrrow_> only monsters have inherent elemental weaknesses
[4:46:48] <Golgo16> Always hated Algus, he's a huge dick of a character, but also his gear is so awful
[4:46:49] <+rcand9> power of lupus
[4:46:50] <startadevy> amiloIcedT
[4:46:51] <Prevot> that die scream sounds like a meow
[4:46:55] <+TeethMuncher> She'd die
[4:46:58] <%MisterCrimson> So, by Paige's logic Quitis is pronounced Key-tis
[4:47:04] <%MisterCrimson> *Quistis

[4:47:45] <$LocDogX86X> Bards are the best
[4:47:45] <Mendin> MAXIMUM LV. BIG AND STRONG
[4:47:46] <$HeavyMettle> Yea Paige should be a druid
[4:47:46] <startadevy> she need that encounter duh
[4:47:47] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[4:47:49] <$SGrim> Neutral Good Bard is the only real class.

[4:47:57] <OspreySoul> Paige used VICIOUS MOCKERY
[4:47:59] <GalaxyGirlChel> noooooo dude
[4:48:00] <Bouldus> bards are great
[4:48:00] <sparrrow_> in this universe the more you believe in God the stronger your magic is, but if you don't believe in God magic bounces right off you
[4:48:00] <Warfey> No, Paige, you have high or average Int, but like no Wisdom LUL
[4:48:02] <%Dingus_Tickler> Paige as an RPG Character would be someone with really low stats, but has this fucking Monster Hunter Greatsword, and when you pick an action, she does a random action. She also takes HP damage every turn and can’t consume normal food, she can only heal through gallons of mustard.
[4:48:03] <startadevy> masterball
[4:48:04] <+filthyheretichorus> bards are fucking OP as shit
[4:48:04] <%AdamRomanus> Paige is not a bone-head

[4:48:07] <$HeavyMettle> @AngriestPat she needs to be a druid. She can wild shape into big and strong things
[4:48:08] <%Sendrak70> Bards are the best.
[4:48:10] <elementofloyalty> Puberty makes paige big
[4:48:10] <Pygmalionic> Low Int Alchemist sounds like a fun time
[4:48:10] <GalaxyGirlChel> she would be like Naruto from flcl
[4:48:13] <Bouldus> you dont even know dnd if you think bards are bad
[4:48:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Berserker

[4:48:36] <OkamiDude15> so what your saying is that paige is a horrible fighter BUT A BRILLIANT SCIENTIST! lytBADMAN
[4:48:36] <Bouldus> youd be a battle rager barbarian hill dwarf @AngriestPat
[4:48:37] <ink_dino> I figure this is why Pat is so empathic in Shadow of the Colossus
[4:48:37] <%GeneSlamm> Bards in pathfinder are the best
[4:48:37] <TrubbleBass> Pat is too tall for a Dwarf, he's Gnome Barbarian all the way
[4:48:38] <Valkyrjsen> Bards in FF14 are just archers. LUL
[4:48:38] <PakuV2> Lancers will always be the ultimate class
[4:48:39] <%Arxel1> Bards are great
[4:48:39] <startadevy> cthulhu

[4:48:45] <%ECRead> fuck you, no buffs for you
[4:48:45] <Zerodeath2> Paige as a bard would rick roll enemies to DEATH
[4:48:45] <%rdark_ksu> pat would be a dwarf rogue or bard, possible cleric if nihilism is a god
[4:48:45] <Spydurman> Sam's Bard in Critical role was MVP all the time
[4:48:47] <+Schleperd> Bards in D&D ain't bad.
[4:48:47] <%Dingus_Tickler> Pat looks like a Dwarf but hits like a Gnome LUL
[4:48:48] <@CoalSavoie> Bards/Dancer in Tactics is a great support skill tho
[4:48:48] <+Bustamente> You are just jealous that you aren't a cool charismatic person who can play an instrument
[4:48:49] <+TerryTheTurret> @GalaxyGirlChel lol is that from season 2? rooKek
[4:48:49] <$HeavyMettle> ok, I'm confused. Are we talking final fantasy classes now or dnd/pathfinder?

[4:48:55] <+Nomicro4u> Parivir
[4:48:55] <elementofloyalty> Bards are singers
[4:48:57] <RichAnvils> kensai
[4:48:59] <+Rezca> Etrian Odyssey Troubadours are excellent
[4:48:59] <%Mawarup> thats like alot of things
[4:49:00] <+JavaManJoJo> Pat would be a named NPC
[4:49:00] <OspreySoul> Bard from the College of Swords for Paige?
[4:49:00] <ink_dino> Rogues
[4:49:02] <pennykettle_> Thats so vague
[4:49:03] <+korth367> berserker
[4:49:04] <+ymorn> Thats a Rogue
[4:49:04] <Bouldus> the lack of dnd knowledge is triggering me
[4:49:05] <$dotta5> All the games???
[4:49:06] <+Schleperd> lol
[4:49:07] <startadevy> everyone is a troll
[4:49:08] <%Remery_> Rogue?

[4:49:19] <elementofloyalty> "Me Ha ha "
[4:49:21] <+AntithesisEK> big words because thing the game that I am
[4:49:21] <RichAnvils> kensai have high THAC0, but can equip armor
[4:49:22] <Fathuran> A melee glass cannon? Probably rogue, assassin, d&d kensai
[4:49:22] <+ymorn> Rogue is glass cannon
[4:49:22] <%ssjklyco> Words come out, but no info
[4:49:23] <Parapattern> Paige is like the old woman who goes to a bookstore and wants to find a book that she doesn't know the name of but that the cover is blue.
[4:49:24] <%AdamRomanus> You gotta narrow that shit down Paige
[4:49:24] <$dotta5> ohhhhhhh, Burger time
[4:49:25] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Let's be real here, if Pat or Paige were a class of character in a game, it'd be NPCs.
[4:49:26] <$SGrim> Rogues, but they are also magic.
[4:49:28] <Zerodeath2> Paige as a bard would rick roll enemies to DEATH
[4:49:29] <Solidus_113> Diablo 3
[4:49:29] <%Dingus_Tickler> LUL
[4:49:31] <%RAWKPARTEE> Bards are the worst.
[4:49:32] <$OmegaWeltall> Well for dancer which is female only you need melee classes
[4:49:32] <elementofloyalty> LSD Paige
[4:49:32] <AlasterAngelo> bards are nuts in DnD
[4:49:40] <%Dingus_Tickler> “It was me haha”
[4:49:41] <%Sendrak70> Sounds like a Berserker
[4:49:43] <startadevy> mom and dad

[4:49:45] <Spydurman> Rogue
[4:49:45] <ULT_13> spoony bards

[4:49:46] <buttdirt> you prison shank 'em
[4:49:46] <london_flexing> Berserkers in Fire Emblem
[4:49:46] <%AbnormalEnd> Glass Cannon
[4:49:47] <%ziriken> rogue?
[4:49:48] <Warfey> that could describe any class that isn't specifically a tank
[4:49:48] <Bouldus> yea assassination rogue
[4:49:49] <shiny_prinny> Rogue
[4:49:50] <TrubbleBass> Sounds like rouge
[4:49:51] <OspreySoul> Rogue with Disengage?
[4:49:51] <%AbnormalVoid> That's many thing
[4:49:51] <sparrrow_> ninja
[4:49:52] <StarSkullyman> assassin
[4:49:52] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Is Paige saying she'd be a Ninja?
[4:49:53] <%Arazien> Rogues are ABSOLUTELY glass cannons. Low AC and HP for HUGE damage and skills
[4:49:53] <Pygmalionic> Myrmidon
[4:49:55] <eco419> rogueeeeeee
[4:49:56] <pennykettle_> Thats nothing, that means nothing
[4:49:57] <Prevot> Paige is Myrmidon from FE
[4:49:57] <elementofloyalty> Peach is filled with Sticky YEAST
[4:49:57] <$LocDogX86X> Rangers got great dmg but no def
[4:49:58] <Quietshun13> That's a lot of things Paige
[4:49:58] <+bumbletroni> Did that mage just suicide?
[4:49:58] <%AdamRomanus> Rogue or Assassin
[4:49:58] <Bouldus> or like scout rogue
[4:50:00] <$HeavyMettle> @AngriestPat that is a standard style of class in a lot of different games. It is too vague to make an accurate guess
[4:50:00] <PakuV2> The lupus has got to her brain
[4:50:01] <Mariakko> That's a rogue. High damage, low def, BUT hard to hit.
[4:50:01] <GalaxyGirlChel> ninja bard
[4:50:01] <+Kain5707> black mage is a glass cannon
[4:50:02] <OspreySoul> Paige as Bard Rogue
[4:50:03] <blackorchidKI2> I would like to be a Myrmidom, or whatever it's called. So I can just be a jack of all trades
[4:50:06] <Mendin> ...Assassin?
[4:50:11] <mercado94> LUL
[4:50:13] <TrubbleBass> SNEAK ATTACK THEN RUN AWAY! Hahahahaha
[4:50:13] <%cryobyjorn> like really any rogue in DnD
[4:50:15] <%cryobyjorn> ?
[4:50:16] <dsauce999> stoops
[4:50:23] <+rcand9> assassin dragon age origins
[4:50:24] <Spydurman> Pat's always right Jebaited
[4:50:26] <+NWR_James> WHATS THE RULE
[4:50:27] <ink_dino> We are absolutely his personal army
[4:50:27] <%Remery_> The Pat Coalition
[4:50:28] <%Mawarup> or and elementalist
[4:50:29] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat Paige, You are saying you want to be BIG AND STRONG. Rogues are not BIG AND STRONG, they are AGILE AND DEXTEROUS
[4:50:29] <%ssjklyco> you guys do that all the time though
[4:50:30] <%GianniVoices> There are some games with Berserker/Barbarian types which trade good defense for a rageful assault. Bigstrong.
[4:50:30] <+AntithesisEK> this is how it do
[4:50:31] <$GohanEgret> BibleThump 7
[4:50:33] <$HeavyMettle> @AngriestPat The Swordmaster or assassin in Fire Emblem?
[4:50:34] <OspreySoul> High charisma, high dex, low con
[4:50:34] <Sypheck> that's like literally thousands of games you could be describing atpCarl
[4:50:36] <+filthyheretichorus> a ninja...?
[4:50:37] <elementofloyalty> SMOKE BOMB
[4:50:38] <Valkyrjsen> Paige could be a Hexblade. They are warlock spellswords with high Charisma. Paige's warlock pact would make her sword grow stronger as she kills women. Keepo
[4:50:38] <$BoSteed> They don't think it be like it is but it do.
[4:50:42] <%PatNTheHat> People don't think chat be like it is
[4:50:43] <babblingcabbage> This is Pats stream so I'm on Pats side
[4:50:50] <fireking900> HOW CAN IT BE
[4:50:52] <%ziriken> the chat is always right
[4:50:55] <sparrrow_> is this the psp version with the patch?
[4:50:55] <%ziriken> confirmed
[4:50:56] <+TeethMuncher> But a blind rogue would be awful?
[4:50:57] <TrubbleBass> Gotta get them flat footed for them extra d6s of Damage
[4:50:58] <GalaxyGirlChel> shes a bard, truth
[4:50:59] <hntronium> HOW COULD THIS BE
[4:50:59] <%Remery_> Who wouldn't want to be in Pat's Army?
[4:51:02] <%Dingus_Tickler> ASSEMBLE THE MILITIA
[4:51:05] <AMajorTom> We will gang up with anybody who asks!
[4:51:07] <+filthyheretichorus> Monk?
[4:51:07] <$LocDogX86X> Thiefs also are all dmg but shit def
[4:51:08] <therealchadius> Man, Pat is crushing this mission.
[4:51:09] <%RAWKPARTEE> @sparrrow_ yes
[4:51:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> It means pat always wins.
[4:51:09] <%MisterCrimson> I'd like to be a Dark Knight, but I'm definitely be a Cleric IRL
[4:51:12] <+d00msdaydan> paige was saying she didn't remember the game or what the class was, so she basically was saying absolutely nothing
[4:51:13] <$noteisiger> that or if you want to buy $100 worth of Plat
[4:51:14] <dsauce999> LUL
[4:51:15] <+Kain5707> black mage!
[4:51:15] <elementofloyalty> :)
[4:51:20] <randomp141> Paige want's to be a Amazon when she grows up.
[4:51:21] <%Dingus_Tickler> CRAZY TALK BRIGADE FORM
[4:51:25] <%ziriken> im having crazy deja vu
[4:51:25] <%Sendrak70> @AngriestPat Sounds like a berserker kind of class.
[4:51:30] <%rdark_ksu> agility is quickness
[4:51:32] <+Bustamente> Pat is short and fat so a lot of people are faster than him
[4:51:33] <%rdark_ksu> nvm
[4:51:35] <%ssjklyco> She's fast to go to the hospital
[4:51:36] <+TeethMuncher> Gymnastics
[4:51:36] <WHMBoar> what class uses Cha and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE
[4:51:36] <hntronium> CRAZY TALK BRIGADE IS HERE
[4:51:38] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Would would your SPECIAL stats be?
[4:51:40] <Prevot> ?????
[4:51:40] <GalaxyGirlChel> shed be a ninja, kill someone, then be like "oh shit I'm sorry" and cry
[4:51:44] <blackorchidKI2> I'M FAST AS FUCK BOIU
[4:51:45] <Zeikier> S p e e d
[4:51:46] <$GohanEgret> paige is a tank
[4:51:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> CRAZY TALK
[4:51:51] <mercado94> dexterity is presitiob
[4:51:52] <TrubbleBass> @WHMBoar Bards pretty much
[4:51:53] <Prevot> how the fuck is agility not speed
[4:51:58] <Rigelz01> dosent star sign stuff matter aswel
[4:51:58] <elementofloyalty> Shots foot
[4:51:59] <babblingcabbage> Falling over and agility are not the same
[4:52:01] <+AntithesisEK> is Paige a Marauder?
[4:52:02] <+Skatedeandre> dex is like being technical
[4:52:03] <Zeikier> dexterity is your hand charisma
[4:52:04] <+bumbletroni> Yeah, bards are basically all CHR
[4:52:07] <$GohanEgret> revolver peachelot
[4:52:08] <+Kinoskae> Paige is a Warlock
[4:52:08] <%Dingus_Tickler> Paige is higher in Speed than Pat, which is a little more than not at all. She also has no Dex LUL
[4:52:11] <%ssjklyco> They were both pregnant
[4:52:12] <blackbaron98> paige will pull up with that stick
[4:52:12] <+rcand9> pirate class in bravely default?
[4:52:13] <+TheGershon> whats CON
[4:52:15] <eco419> agility = acrobatics
[4:52:19] <CybertronPrime> In XIV I'm a Red Mage. Blast 'em from afar with magic, then rush in with sick sword combos, then backflip away and resume the magical assault.
[4:52:19] <Solidus_113> you were pretty agile spinning that shadow puzzle around
[4:52:22] <elementofloyalty> THE END
[4:52:24] <+BoboDaHobo> @mercado94 that typo is perfectly placed
[4:52:24] <mercado94> did she kill two woman?
[4:52:24] <$BoSteed> Peach almost killed her teammate, but she did it. LUL
[4:52:27] <GetWicked> !uptime
[4:52:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 52m 36s.
[4:52:28] <therealchadius> FIRST TRY?
[4:52:29] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Agile is like when you have to go between posts in the ground, like a skier or a dog.
[4:52:29] <Zerodeath2> Paige killed 3 ppl
[4:52:31] <fallacy8> haste is only good if you have good compatibility with your party
[4:52:35] <Bouldus> Paige is a zealot barbarian, cant die while raging cant be knocked unconscious while raging @AngriestPat
[4:52:35] <fireking900> i think pagie is that one dark souls class, waste of skin
[4:52:36] <elementofloyalty> four hrs?
[4:52:36] <TrubbleBass> Someone needs to find the tomato analogy for DnD stats
[4:52:38] <$GohanEgret> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[4:52:47] <$HeavyMettle> @AngriestPat I always rush monk, and ninja. Because a monk with knight armor or a knight with dual weild are very strong
[4:52:48] <elementofloyalty> wimins?
[4:52:49] <RichAnvils> 'black mage is just a race' - pat boivin 2018
[4:52:50] <Spydurman> @AngriestPat Paige would be Mercer's DnD class Blood Hunter that hurts itself to do damage
[4:52:52] <%ssaryn> Good job killing more VVymen Paige.
[4:52:53] <therealchadius> Oh boy, time to hate Algus- I mean Argath again
[4:52:54] <dsauce999> LUL
[4:52:55] <pennykettle_> I need a WWymyn
[4:52:58] <GalaxyGirlChel> vvomens?
[4:52:59] <eco419> he read me 🙂🙂
[4:53:00] <%AdamRomanus> Paige hates women confirmed.
[4:53:01] <mercado94> @BoboDaHobo i didnt notice it. FUCK
[4:53:02] <fallacy8> @AngriestPat whats your favorite spell in this game? Mine's dark holy/holy
[4:53:02] <+JustbeJake> Her defense is pretty strong considering the the events that just transpired. Could a mage handle a car?
[4:53:04] <+Skatedeandre> And almost killed the Mc as weep
[4:53:15] <elementofloyalty> Paige does not hate her Mommy
[4:53:18] <GalaxyGirlChel> a tank bard
[4:53:19] <%Dingus_Tickler> Paige passed the Acrobatic Skill Check when she uppercutted that pregnant women in her gut
[4:53:20] <$HeavyMettle> Cloud skill timers are also fixed. They were horrendous in original
[4:53:21] <hntronium> ITS FINE
[4:53:21] <%AbnormalVoid> Agility is Moving Quickly, Dexterity is Controlling Things Deftly
[4:53:23] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat Agility is your ability to do a standing back flip, dexterity is your ability to perform surgery on arteries
[4:53:24] <hntronium> SHE WAS BARREN
[4:53:28] <Valkyrjsen> Paige has low CON, but really high HP regen speed.
[4:53:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just like Levi woulda done
[4:53:53] <GalaxyGirlChel> @valkyrjsen so....shes deadpool?
[4:53:54] <blackorchidKI2> Oh shit, I meant to say Factotum, but oh well.
[4:53:57] <+rcand9> argos did nowt wrong
[4:54:04] <Prevot> man I love this game's artstyle
[4:54:07] <Zeikier> algus is about to tell you about his favorite weekend meeting with wakka
[4:54:30] <Zeikier> the spritework in this game is great until they suddenly decide to be boring as shit after chapter 3
[4:54:32] <%AdamRomanus> This game needs a sequel in the same time period so bad.
[4:54:36] <startadevy> speed is mental
[4:54:40] <Sokumotanaka> Pat you're speaking my language here
[4:54:49] <+Frozendragons> A2 has great visuals!
[4:54:49] <%Remery_> Chibi Realism needs more play
[4:54:49] <+Sycada> Gustav? Saga Frontier?
[4:54:49] <%HiroTSK5> Also you don't have to constantly fight the camera in FFTA.
[4:54:52] <%Paralurx> it just.... works
[4:54:55] <therealchadius> Also no one has a nose
[4:54:57] <Valkyrjsen> Its a chibi cutesy game with an incredibly dark and deeply political storyline.
[4:54:57] <$dotta5> Fun Fact: Cecil Harvey is an anagram for Dickbutt
[4:54:59] <smokey02> y-you can play tactics on ps4? is this a pslive thing?
[4:55:06] <Zeikier> it works cuz it also goes all out with gore when they need to
[4:55:06] <+Laycas49> Pat is looking quite voluptuous today
[4:55:07] <+AntithesisEK> a n i m e ~
[4:55:12] <StarSkullyman> Semi-Chibi?
[4:55:13] <$noteisiger> It's like a dirty dollhouse
[4:55:13] <Zeikier> pre-rendered backgrounds own
[4:55:18] <sparrrow_> it's like xenogears with 3d backgrounds and Sprite characters
[4:55:18] <GalaxyGirlChel> Paige is deadpool. confirmed.
[4:55:18] <TrubbleBass> Sounds like most armies to be fair "wards done, now fuck off"
[4:55:19] <+ZweihanderSteve> It's Yoshida at his finest. Saem designer as Bravely Default.
[4:55:20] <SurvivalShotgun> akihiko yoshida's artstyle is amazing in everything he does
[4:55:21] <TioXyco> @smokey02 PPSSPP. PSP emulation
[4:55:22] <$Agami23> @smokey02 its an emulator. he is just using a ps4 controller
[4:55:23] <Zeikier> "stylized" :V
[4:55:24] <%Remery_> @Laycas49 very curvy
[4:55:25] <+Andrizzleton> SD, sorta deformed
[4:55:29] <+rcand9> dark art style for dark boys
[4:55:30] <elementofloyalty> 5 5 5 5
[4:55:30] <$GohanEgret> 5
[4:55:34] <+DrBunn> 5 is perfect
[4:55:35] <smokey02> k thx
[4:55:36] <SurvivalShotgun> by the way he did the designs for nier automata as well
[4:55:37] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> 5555555 its great
[4:55:37] <startadevy> smashing them GPUs togetha
[4:55:38] <+rcand9> woof
[4:55:40] <$dotta5> so is 1...
[4:55:41] <ink_dino> easily divides?
[4:55:41] <+TeethMuncher> One of the few odd numbers
[4:55:41] <dsauce999> 5
[4:55:42] <$OmegaWeltall> Aanemeeeee avalonEYES
[4:55:42] <%rdark_ksu> 3 is best number and all numbers divisible by 3 are best
[4:55:42] <Klefth> Akihiko Yoshida is fucking sick, man. Did you know this is the same guy who did the character designs for Nier Automatomatoes? @AngriestPat
[4:55:43] <london_flexing> Painter-seque
[4:55:44] <+Bustamente> isnt 5 prime?
[4:55:45] <therealchadius> Uh, 5 is a prime number
[4:55:45] <+Nomicro4u> I like 69
[4:55:45] <SwindlerOfProgress> 5 is good.
[4:55:46] <$HeavyMettle> @sparrrow_ yea, the look was really nice and it only happened because they lacked the budget to do full 3d
[4:55:46] <ink_dino> by 5 and by 1?
[4:55:48] <+ymorn> Law of Fives !
[4:55:49] <Zeikier> "Yeah! I love 5!" pat boivin
[4:55:50] <SovPho> wtf no
[4:55:51] <%Dingus_Tickler> doodFive doodFive doodFive doodFive doodFive doodFive
[4:55:51] <Darren716> 5 is a solid number, easily in my top 3
[4:55:52] <SovPho> 2 and 1
[4:55:53] <+bumbletroni> what about 2?
[4:55:54] <+SpectralShot> Jebaited
[4:55:54] <elementofloyalty> 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50
[4:55:54] <$dotta5> 1
[4:55:57] <pennykettle_> 2?
[4:55:57] <SovPho> what about fucking 0?
[4:55:58] <AMajorTom> only in base ten
[4:55:58] <fireking900> 5 is best number
[4:55:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> I suppose Peach could cross-class magical abilities with some sort of martial skill.
[4:55:59] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> 5 is the worst prime number
[4:55:59] <blackorchidKI2> Wow, I can see a lot of things that the Disgaea series took from this game.
[4:55:59] <+TheShal> 2?
[4:56:00] <+SirHellsing420> @AngriestPat happy birthday!
[4:56:02] <MelBrooksKA> But 3 and 4 divides better
[4:56:02] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> he means it's a good denominator
[4:56:03] <+Andrizzleton> 5 can literally only divide into numbers ending in 5 and 0
[4:56:04] <pennykettle_> 1, 2, 0
[4:56:06] <$SGrim> 5 is half of base 10, thus it is pleasing to the mathematically inclined.
[4:56:06] <TheLastRhino> 0 is the easiest
[4:56:07] <$Chimeraelite> I like 13 and 666 cause I'm edgy
[4:56:07] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> base-12
[4:56:07] <%rzb0828> quick maffs
[4:56:08] <%Dingus_Tickler> doodLeon doodFive doodLeon doodFive
[4:56:08] <%BeardedLuchador> Really any tactics game
[4:56:10] <+ymorn> Hail Eris!
[4:56:10] <Mendin> 5 is great because you can shove whatever classes together and have a good time
[4:56:13] <Mendin> aka the Fiesta
[4:56:14] <TheLastRhino> 1 is easier
[4:56:14] <GalaxyGirlChel> Paige is brawler?
[4:56:18] <+Bustamente> Pat's favorite number is 0 because you can divide anything by it
[4:56:19] <+skylerpilot> Guys he didn't mean the most he meant the easiest
[4:56:20] <GalaxyGirlChel> Or monk?
[4:56:23] <$noteisiger> ² is the best power though
[4:56:23] <+Ilpala271> ...what about 2?
[4:56:24] <therealchadius> Final Fantasy Tactics = Fiddle in menus for 20 minutes, get screwed in round 1
[4:56:25] <+LowBatteryLife> You should try Tactics Ogre on psp, it's the closest thing to FFT we can get.
[4:56:30] <Valkyrjsen> @Klefth Those official Nier:A illustratiosn do have a real hint of FFT in them, or Yoshida's style I suppose.
[4:56:31] <Bouldus> Paige you could be a zealot barbarian
[4:56:34] <sparrrow_> speed and power break
[4:56:35] <$Chimeraelite> fuck yes
[4:56:37] <%BeardedLuchador> just keep going
[4:56:37] <MelBrooksKA> 3, 4, and 6 are literally ANTI-PRIMES
[4:56:39] <$BoSteed> Yeyeye
[4:56:40] <%fredan31> yeah all the way
[4:56:40] <elementofloyalty> WHAT ABOUT GOD F WAR?
[4:56:41] <%Remery_> There is so many classes in this game <3
[4:56:41] <%AbnormalVoid> Mages are Glass Cannons, order of classes
[4:56:42] <SeruraRenge> DO IT
[4:56:46] <%AdamRomanus> PLEASE KEEP GOING WITH IT
[4:56:48] <Ryo_no_Kage> You got like 1k viewers tho
[4:56:48] <amavii> Is this War of the Lions?
[4:56:49] <therealchadius> Please stream this more!
[4:56:54] <MarylandJutsu> @amavii yes
[4:56:55] <Valkyrjsen> She can sing, also.
[4:56:56] <Bouldus> while raging cant be killed or knocked unconscious
[4:56:58] <AMajorTom> Pat doesn't know he's lying, but he is.
[4:57:02] <elementofloyalty> :D
[4:57:02] <Klefth> @Valkyrjsen Because he did those
[4:57:03] <Fathuran> So, a useless bard.

[4:57:11] <startadevy> ThankEgg weight
[4:57:11] <sparrrow_> parry only works if your weapon has a percentage on it
[4:57:12] <TheOnlyStrayCat> THUS PROVES THE POINT.
[4:57:12] <RichAnvils> you're a bard who hates being a bard
[4:57:13] <GalaxyGirlChel> Jebaited

[4:57:16] <Solidus_113> LUL

[4:57:18] <elementofloyalty> BIRTHDAY BOY
[4:57:20] <%MisterCrimson> In 5e bards are awesome, shut up Pat.
[4:57:25] <Sokumotanaka> Watch the unexpectables the bard on that is the best and he's the tank
[4:57:25] <%Dingus_Tickler> A bard who can’t even play an instrument LUL
[4:57:28] <$noteisiger> pretty sure this is Blood Mage
[4:57:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> EMBRACE YOUR INNER BARDIC APPEAL
[4:57:35] <GalaxyGirlChel> also Paige has low luck
[4:57:36] <+quarkee> im totally a green mage because nobody likes me
[4:57:36] <Graxe_> Paige might as well be a Black Mage in FF14. Stand in one spot and blow everything up.
[4:57:37] <mercado94> POR QUE?

[4:58:05] <%RAWKPARTEE> Archer d00d!!
[4:58:07] <GalaxyGirlChel> shes a bonk, bard monk
[4:58:08] <+LowBatteryLife> Did she trade all of her stats to the GM so they'd let her have a super broken magic sword as initial equipment?
[4:58:08] <Covil91> Am I banned or something? I can't see chat
[4:58:10] <%ziriken> White mage
[4:58:10] <randomp141> Should have modded the game so he could make Paige a Mustard Goblin.
[4:58:10] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Paige is like the character you have to look after during the escotrt mission.
[4:58:11] <@StridentSong> I DID NOT
[4:58:11] <%Remery_> White Mage is just a Chemist under a sheet
[4:58:11] <+Bustamente> ARROWS ARE COOL
[4:58:12] <$HeavyMettle> wm is better now but the job tree will not flourish like archer @AngriestPat
[4:58:13] <eco419> Paige is the bard that only play one song

[4:58:34] <Sypheck> archers are pro
[4:58:37] <elementofloyalty> ????
[4:58:38] <+rcand9> archers suck
[4:58:39] <Valkyrjsen> Archer with throw items is decent.
[4:58:44] <%RAWKPARTEE> Archer goes dragoon next?
[4:58:44] <Prevot> if she breathe
[4:58:46] <misterspotswood> yeahhh, buff waifus
