[0:06:03] <rovilm> Vampire Oblivion
[0:06:03] <%deviljhojho94> It has been falling apart FOR 15 YEARS
[0:06:04] <%Disname23> the closer you get to the end the more it breaks
[0:06:04] <lionmanguy> Huh. He seems to have a bit too much actual political connections for that. Though it has been a while since I read
[0:06:04] <%Jetsfantasy> rubber bands and glue
[0:06:06] <+BoomerTiro> Just like when it launched!
[0:06:07] <%Laecerelius> It's falling apart as we play it!
[0:06:07] <%Typhaeon> I played this unpatched. It was a struggle, but I loved every minute of it
[0:06:07] <Nitesco> thats part of the charm :)
[0:06:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> it was for a while

[0:20:37] <@lewdskeletor13> CONTEXT
[0:20:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Zatch Bell is people with books casting spells through their companioned midgets.
[0:20:42] <lionmanguy> Together our crack team of scientest's can decipher what he is saying
[0:20:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Zatch Bell is just Digimon with puppets
