[0:06:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> RIP
[0:06:04] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> time to chainsaw
[0:06:05] <Midnight188> immediate chainsaw!
[0:06:06] <troxvon_the_lesser> Oh yessss
[0:06:06] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> X
[0:06:10] <%cvp5127> ok
[0:06:10] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt USE CHAINSAW A LOT. you wont have much ammo!!!
[0:06:13] <%StaceMcGate> We got tutorials now
[0:06:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Did that guy's head get driven into his chest cavity?
[0:06:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> He's like a Chainsaw man
[0:06:14] <%speaks2much> speaks2much subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hi Pat
[0:06:17] <Smaenus> Why my pp hard tho?
[0:06:17] <dukenux> fucking Revengeance VR training?
[0:06:17] <%Valdorick> ... wait... DOES THAT IMPLY HE FUCKING LOST THE OLD ONE!?
[0:06:17] <%Erimos> Look at this tutorial.
[0:06:18] <twisted__fister> what the fuck is this training level
[0:06:18] <%optimasmaximas> Kreygasm
[0:06:19] <person181> UGH tutorials
[0:06:19] <morningmoondude> that was some ripping, deffo followed by tearing.
[0:06:19] <tusk102> no more taking it out manually!!
[0:06:24] <marvel877> stream messing up for anyone else?
[0:06:24] <@commanderclaw> The Chainsaw has that Human Revolution tech now, it always regens the last pip
[0:06:24] <Namillus> Part of the reason Hurt Me Plenty might feel too easy is Extra Lives are BUSTED
[0:06:25] <Zaktheaussie> that's a great change
[0:06:26] <%D00msDayDan> making it a button instead of a switch to is much smoother
[0:06:27] <+DesertPenguin> This is immersion breaking wtf
[0:06:27] <Morbidmort> And now the ammo looks like confetti
[0:06:31] <+Pookiedaexzile> Issa Rainbow
[0:06:31] <%MyNameIsRasus> PISTOL NOT NEEDED ANYMORE
[0:06:32] <NeroInfinite> they knew how much you liked to chainsaw
[0:06:35] <lloyddboy> HONK
[0:06:36] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt chainsawing the fodder enemies is VERY VERY IMPORTANT
[0:06:36] <$NocturneNovember> I miss anything good so far?
[0:06:37] <+boondoggle42> Is this a different team? It looks so different
[0:06:37] <%mankeyfigh> YES
[0:06:38] <Namillus> And if you go out of your way to explore you just HAVE EXTRA LIVES
[0:06:39] <%Louie_Salmon> @valdorick This feels like a VR mission honestly
[0:06:41] <%AnIcedCoffee> waaahh my immersion
[0:06:44] <%MrBorisMakarov> YEAH IT IS
[0:06:45] <EuropanLamprey> I love how Doom doesn't even try to pretend to be anything other than "Video Game"
[0:06:45] <tiaramaki> It's SO GOOD
[0:06:46] <Taco_Salsaguy> Sweet
[0:06:47] <%StaceMcGate> @DesertPenguin this game has 16 bit powerups, its just a game.

[0:10:07] <SparkAfterDark> This game feels like it's too worried about you liking it to have any kind of build up. Doom16 built up fast but it didn't just throw the shotgun, upgrade and chainsaw at you in one second

[0:13:15] <Sundaysmiles01> thats a huge bitch
[0:13:15] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt "When confronted, DO NOT attempt to fight the Doomslayer. Just laydown and let it happen. Studies have shown that further aggravating the Doom Marine will only make him angrier and your death more painful."
[0:13:16] <%AncelDeLambert> the demonic WHAT?!
[0:13:17] <SparkAfterDark> Huh. It actually feels kind of weird to have doomguy kill a straight up person, like a dude that is talking to you with words

[0:13:57] <tusk102> @Valdorick admittedly no one else is able to kill said fucko
[0:14:01] <LeNino> i need a mood where doom guy talks with Pat voice and phrases
[0:14:01] <DestroyerPhoenix> how does he belch with a helmet on tho
[0:14:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hit it from the back
[0:14:07] <%wsintai> @TOONFOOD Detroit would be improved by the addition of all this fire
[0:14:11] <+Pookiedaexzile> See Dante never truly mastered GunSlinger

[0:15:08] <+A0N33> Inb4 there's another weapon like five feet away
[0:15:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> VEGA HAS DOOM SLAYER COLOURS NOW
[0:15:11] <Idon__> just switch out the entire fucking barrel lmao
[0:15:12] <BoneBagMel> he chose do combo
[0:15:13] <%necrocannibal2> tbh I don't get why the military would be so ineffective when Doomguy seems to do fine
[0:15:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Well, it's no 7 Hour War. But it's close.
[0:15:16] <%Valdorick> Aw, they're vega drones, so he doesn't punch then anymore. That's cute.
[0:15:18] <Sundaysmiles01> Just have what you want
[0:15:20] <ShichiNoBushi> Doomguy nice. He didn't punch the drone for his upgrade.
[0:15:20] <indig0bird> He doesn't punch them anymore! I think that was player feedback plus it's VEGA now
[0:15:21] <ScreamLord> Galting Shotty, YEAH!
[0:15:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> play the song, Mick
[0:15:25] <tusk102> @necrocannibal2 you'll find out why later

[0:16:44] <CloudCircus> Try a plunging attack
[0:16:47] <%AncelDeLambert> clearly this doesn't take place immediately after the first game, so what's Doomslayer been doing this whole time?
[0:16:50] <%Valdorick> YEYEYEYE
[0:16:50] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt did you notice that the bodies take real time damage and get chunks blown off from your gun?

[0:31:45] <+deepether> @queequegtheater Doomguy is blessed by the seraphim and can rip demonic horns apart with his bear hands. I’m guessing that means he can at least break steel in half. Unless Dante’s skin is made of Carbon nanoalloy he can be ripped and torn.
[0:31:48] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> because of course
[0:31:49] <%necrocannibal2> LUL
[0:31:50] <RushUnplugged> 1) Dante literally cannot die, he works on cartoon rules 2) they would hi5 and shoot more demons together, NERDS

[0:32:42] <de1ete_forever> brain at risk
[0:32:42] <oruandrew> u mean dmc 2?
[0:32:43] <SparkAfterDark> I don't like the idea of the Slayer ever not being able to shoot. That climbing thing is uncomfortable
[0:32:46] <$QueequegTheater> @deepether Vergil (and by extension Dante because they're identical twins) gets cut in half with rebellion and his chest has already healed over before the sword exits his back
[0:32:47] <+Pookiedaexzile> @QueequegTheater So you're arguement is Doom guy doesn't fight like a dumbass, and punch. I guess you got me there, Bro. only strength maters, not superior tatics and experience killing demons much stronger than himself. Also in Doom 2016 they state you've killed multiple titians, bigger than cities, you literally crawl around in the corspes of one
[0:32:52] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt it's a big demon carrying a temple on his back
[0:32:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dee em cee 2
[0:32:55] <+Hitorio> Is there a debate happening about Dante vs Doomguy?
[0:32:58] <SparkAfterDark> how will he kill if his hands are busy with climbing?
[0:33:00] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> That demon was floating in midair
[0:33:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Zombie Marines are attacking the imps
[0:33:07] <%SirGO0SE> omg this doomguy v dante talk in the chat LUL
[0:33:09] <%MrBorisMakarov> LOOK AT THIS VIDEO GAME MECHANIC
[0:33:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Hitorio for the past 15 mins
[0:33:18] <Saltmeisterr> the audio team did a fantastic kob
[0:33:19] <borkmire> start of level you missed him
[0:33:21] <%spiritofmojave> Oh my god it's a Gamefaqs forum now
[0:33:24] <+razielhex> This is the scene where Bethesda/ID had the basketball players play
[0:33:26] <$QueequegTheater> @Pookiedaexzile Experience doesn't matter when your opponent could literally slice you into mist in a literal millisecond.
[0:33:33] <%mankeyfigh> Sin Devil Trigger is kinda busted
[0:33:35] <tiaramaki> monkaS
[0:33:37] <%MyNameIsRasus> I really hope someone mods a style meter into this game
[0:33:38] <%Faustgesicht> WHATCHA SELLIN?
[0:33:39] <%Jekado> they are in hell?
[0:33:39] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> It bothers me that doomguy isnt one punching those jobber demons
[0:33:40] <FlamingoJazz> She did
[0:33:40] <Mister_McDerp> monkaS
[0:33:41] <Nupinoop296> Dante and Doomguy would be friends after a brief misunderstanding
[0:33:41] <%rytyoung> she said WHAT
[0:33:42] <+PhysicsLB> she's kinda already there
[0:33:44] <%SoFarFetched> Guys cmon lets just enjoy a game like holy shit LUL
[0:33:46] <+Hitorio> If there's been a 15 minute long debate on it, I guess I've been underestimating Doomguy
[0:33:47] <%Rumbutt> oroLUL SHE'S TRYING PAT
[0:33:48] <ShichiNoBushi> I think she already has.
[0:33:49] <dekkitout> Ever since they discovered videogames, the architects of hell have been on a loooong boondoggle LUL
[0:33:49] <%juxtest> She'd love that
[0:33:50] <%Valdorick> Who do these wall cannons help!?
[0:33:54] <+barrakuta371> She brought hell instead
[0:33:54] <Melchior_the_Wise> I mean doesn't pat hat people, wouldn't he try to help the demons?
[0:33:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> *hate
[0:34:03] <de1ete_forever> Arachnotron die good
[0:34:09] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> bruh
[0:34:14] <+razielhex> hahaha the Shao Kahn punch
[0:34:14] <Vertigheist> Arguing over videogames LUL
[0:34:16] <%mankeyfigh> I think Dante has more speed, and can hit hard enough to kill Doomguy
[0:34:18] <$QueequegTheater> @Pookiedaexzile Anyway, I'm bored now. Off to the shadow realm with you.
[0:34:18] <+deepether> @queequegtheater I think you’re right but idk if we’ve ever gotten a solid explanation on what super powers doomguy has actually acquired and been granted over the years.
[0:34:20] <SparkAfterDark> Is the fact that Dante is chill enough to absolve him of being half demon?
[0:34:28] <Namillus> Doomguy has FURY
[0:34:29] <lloyddboy> SECRET
[0:34:30] <%MrBorisMakarov> BECAUSE VIDEO GAME
[0:34:32] <NeroInfinite> It was from the mech
[0:34:34] <Mister_McDerp> HENTAI
[0:34:34] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> HENTAI
[0:34:40] <+deepether> >>>>IMPLY WE CAN DISCUSS GAMES
[0:34:42] <nobody12349> UAC can give Pat his robot body he wants.
[0:34:42] <Melchior_the_Wise> HENTAI

[0:34:45] <%Andrizzleton> DMC V subway
[0:34:47] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> i love that this game has no pistols and gives you mods and weapons out the ass from the get go
[0:34:48] <%SirGO0SE> zoneLemmyL zoneGasm zoneLemmyR
[0:34:51] <%YakumoYomi> NO TIME...oh wait, we finished that game.
[0:34:54] <$QueequegTheater> @deepether Which is why you have to you explicit feats, and Dante's are way better than DG's.
[0:34:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Vega Drones look like Doom Slayer armour and have his colours ooo the baby
[0:34:56] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt the snipers amazing for breaking off weakpoints
[0:34:56] <+Hitorio> Did Lady change her mind about not dating demons?
[0:34:58] <+Bwsdante> missiles
[0:35:00] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt from one of my followers who's playing right now: "Ultra Violence is a mistake". Given how hard I was just getting kicked around, I don't disagree with him.
[0:35:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> @QueequegTheater Dude just because Dante can pick on weaker demons doesnt mean shit. Everytime anything challenging faces him he crumbles. Meanwhile doom guy specializes in "This thing is stronger and faster, I will stillwin"
[0:35:02] <%SodiumPatrol> inb4 psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaMenace psaMenace psaWrong
[0:35:03] <+OneGorillionDollars> Scope is actually useful in this game
[0:35:04] <+Hitorio> Was Eva just a sexual deviant for dating a demon?
[0:35:05] <dekkitout> Okay, but would Dante be big spoon with Doomguy or little spoon? SeriousSloth
[0:35:07] <koolkatdq> Video game
[0:35:09] <tusk102> it does
[0:35:10] <+razielhex> oooh man it has 6-shots and reloads @PatStaresAt
[0:35:14] <marvel877> Precision... for the guy who admitted hes blind.
[0:35:14] <%trustycoyote> Hey chat wasn't VEGA destroyed in DOOM 2016?
[0:35:15] <$QueequegTheater> @Hitorio She love that bug dick
[0:35:18] <%AnIcedCoffee> scope is way better this time
[0:35:18] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> demi-fiend beats both
[0:35:19] <%mankeyfigh> Little spoon
[0:35:25] <%valriot> The game is WAY harder
[0:35:25] <%spiritofmojave> @dekkitout Dante's smoller he'd be little spoon
[0:35:27] <%SirGO0SE> so am i :)
[0:35:28] <Zeemod155> I've heard this is harder than 2016
[0:35:28] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> It plays the same im sure
[0:35:28] <%dmtjinni> SICK
[0:35:30] <%Skelegroove> @trustycoyote he backed him up to a flash drive
[0:35:30] <Saltmeisterr> it messes up weakpoints
[0:35:31] <sunsetserenity1> Doomguy saved a backup of VEGA
[0:35:31] <Maverick2736> I love how the upgrade robots look like the flying power-ups from Contra
[0:35:33] <Namillus> ... oh that's how that works
[0:35:33] <kazadog> @dekkitout dante little spoon 100% not just with doomguy either
[0:35:35] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt the sniper is super strong and it breaks off weakpoints like a fucking champ
[0:35:36] <KingVantq> its way harder than 2016
[0:35:38] <augusta_wind> little spoon? big spoon? knife.
[0:35:38] <not_twitter_rowan> @trustycoyote Doom Slayer made a backup first
[0:35:39] <bettysharkface> Come get y'all meat
[0:35:39] <+razielhex> goo
[0:35:41] <krikitbonez> touch your eyes or don't touch your eyes?
[0:35:42] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> The meaty evil
[0:35:42] <+razielhex> goo on the floor
[0:35:45] <NeroInfinite> nice
[0:35:45] <$QueequegTheater> @persona_is_datingsimtrash Wasn't it implied Dante was going easy on him during that fight?
[0:35:46] <%dmtjinni> HARDER THAN 2016?
[0:35:47] <SparkAfterDark> because you're knee deep in the dead
[0:35:48] <%MrBorisMakarov> DO COMBO
[0:35:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> YEYEYE
[0:35:51] <freelancebabymaker> PREDATORRRRR
[0:35:51] <NeroInfinite> COMBO
[0:35:51] <marvel877> @trustycoyote He saved a backup on a usb drive.
[0:35:52] <%trustycoyote> @Skelegroove THAT'S right Thanks, guys! @not_twitter_rowan
[0:35:55] <+Hitorio> @QueequegTheater I refuse to believe Eva fucked Sparda in bug form WutFace

[0:36:09] <+justianxix> already has the arm blades
[0:36:10] <Mister_McDerp> VORE
[0:36:12] <%VashyronM> Doomguy is a Proto Predator

[0:36:19] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> @QueequegTheater well i meant endgame True Demon Ending Demi-Fiend
