[0:37:02] <%PinkertonDanPie> @patstaresat so how do you rank the opening hours of this vs the opening hours of previous fromsoft games?
[0:37:02] <Tina_Skellybutt> the quartering is an anti trans youtuber who says some pretty biggoted stuff near constantly
[0:37:06] <%sniffy77> guys how the hell do you get above the area where you fight the totally not capra demon
[0:37:07] <MaritimeSpanker> so was Shrine of Amala
[0:37:08] <%Order_of_Mystery> it's not poisonous enough

[0:37:32] <Delta5931> Any zones where I think to myself "Huh, there could just be a drop-off here into super deep water and I would never know" is enough to strike fear into my heart.

[0:44:27] <3Xgilly> coward
[0:44:27] <%Broand> That's some agressive AI
[0:44:28] <%mofuceo> Might want to go in when he's charging you like that
[0:44:31] <RubberFistFight> pat look out Kappa
[0:44:32] <doster504> anyone else run into the terribly balanced ds2 bosses near the end yet I cannot get past some of them
[0:44:33] <%Order_of_Mystery> there's 5 more adds that spawn in and buff it I think.
[0:44:35] <@Spydurman> dude has boss levels of health LUL
[0:44:40] <Shiibbae> There’s 3 on Both sides
[0:44:44] <old_dog_god> Zangief quit it daddy’s malding
[0:44:46] <Notsocleveruser> That is my single most hated enemy in the game
[0:44:47] <+silvery_cricket> you need to pick off the smaller enemies in the area and then used ranged attacks after you dodge the lung
[0:44:56] <%machshop> love that they brought back Latria bells
[0:45:13] <Ell1ot> do you still stab people when you back stab with clubs?
[0:45:17] <%DashXero> And they keep coming back?!
[0:45:26] <Delta5931> I haven't found much of a reason to get off my horse for situations like this, but then again, it is absurdly fast.
[0:45:29] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn
[0:45:36] <+TAFK> not summoning?
[0:45:37] <femto216> Unfair shit
[0:45:39] <old_dog_god> Don’t roll in poison it kills you quicker
[0:45:39] <%PinkertonDanPie> yo anyone in the chat read Brandon Sanderson? He just posted a pretty serious update on his YouTube channel
[0:46:02] <Delta5931> Okay, now I see why you get off your horse.
[0:46:05] <+silvery_cricket> its easier just to ignore it
[0:46:05] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:46:27] <%PinkertonDanPie> pet the baby
[0:46:28] <marvel877> DOG
[0:46:56] <Shiibbae> You can agro the 3 other adds before going to the middle on each side
[0:47:04] <%PinkertonDanPie> Galaxy brain time
[0:47:09] <+FattimusSlime> @PinkertonDanPie I saw that, it's good that he still has most of his fingers, and he doesn't need to smell to write so it shouldn't impact his career too badly.
[0:47:33] <urkleturtle> this thing is a fuck
[0:47:52] <AgnusLaplace> you can feel miyazaki's smug, shit-eating grin from this
[0:47:53] <jmft2000> This enemy sucks
[0:47:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah these guys are some of the worst mobs
[0:47:58] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Only Gieferton can save his father now! But will he??
[0:48:00] <Ner234> Dog good
[0:48:03] <lockhead45> Did stream start earlier? YOOOOO
[0:48:06] <MaybeFalco> could always just run past it to whatever is there
[0:48:07] <digaogrunge> This is way easier with horse
[0:48:08] <feaxel> oleg helped last time
[0:48:10] <+silvery_cricket> Does this thing even drop anything good Ive never killed it before?
[0:48:12] <Delta5931> I'll have to try that mini-boss on my own, because I think I see a way around his speed, but it may not work well for Pat.
[0:48:30] <Ner234> This thing is a fuck
[0:48:40] <+RedMaskBandit> I honestly didn't think this enemy would be troubling for Pat. that thing is just crushing that Patussy
[0:48:42] <terrible35> Oleg Pls
[0:48:43] <%Broand> Super aggro
[0:48:44] <%Bloomingzonda> @PinkertonDanPie I've been meaning to start reading him I hear nothing but good things. I have Steelheart downloaded I need to  read it and Snowcrash after I finish Eisenhorn
[0:49:04] <KitsuneManami> Latest WoW Raid copies Heavenswarn  ending with Estinian
[0:49:07] <trasherxl> Am I wrong or does that thing had problems climbing stone ruins? Kinda looked like it when Pat tried clearing mobs first
[0:49:09] <$vehementvadr> oleg knows your summoning him into bullshit
[0:49:11] <%delilah4you> Hey can someone inform Pat that there is a REALLY cool headpiece on top of Silvius' keep ramparts?

[0:49:55] <femto216> Plague hates these type of enemies and me too
[0:49:55] <MaritimeSpanker> Pat, can you confirm or not that Summons are stronger at night? Friend told me that his group of Inhuman summons do more damage at night-time, but I've yet to hear anything of it from anyone else.
[0:49:57] <Delta5931> 2nd level Ghost Glovewort is a great reward for that!

[1:00:15] <@Fuggins4U> Pat is basically a one-man Wild Hunt
[1:00:23] <%DashXero> I hate those things.

[1:02:38] <%PinkertonDanPie> he saw the bear reaper and got violently scared
[1:02:47] <@Fuggins4U> it meee
[1:02:49] <%delilah4you> yeyeye patch friend!
[1:02:59] <%miabyte> I accidentally killed patches in my playthrough and no one told me to stop
[1:03:01] <Maids4lyfe> holy shit!
[1:03:07] <%abakkus> wonder how he's gonna fuck you over this time
[1:03:12] <RubberFistFight> one of the funniest fucking moments in this game is: [Patches returned to his world.]
[1:03:22] <%PrimalDweeb> Well, I've clearly missed a lot; considering you're duel wielding scythes... O_o
[1:03:23] <%bevyrage> @miabyte patches tells you to stop though
[1:03:33] <@Fuggins4U> I trust this guy.
[1:03:34] <MaritimeSpanker> PFFF
[1:03:35] <ohno58> Bro who are these NPCs...
[1:03:40] <lockhead45> @RubberFistFight I really hope Pat gets to see that and notices
[1:03:44] <%miabyte> @bevyrage I don't play soulsbourne games
[1:03:46] <ape_hawk> so, i think the erdtree is just a massive amount of runes
[1:03:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> oh god those
[1:03:56] <Maids4lyfe> I bet it's getting kicked off a cliff
[1:04:03] <%DashXero> I'm starting to think I shouldn't have killed this guy.
[1:04:03] <@Fuggins4U> A Surviving Virgin was me yearbook award.
[1:04:06] <+PrinceDevian> LUL
[1:04:06] <+TAFK> how long until patches kicks you down that thing
[1:04:07] <zanzibarian_hamster> Is Patches unironically a good person in this game? I mean relatively
[1:04:08] <RubberFistFight> lol patches is literally like "Yo! Dude!! VIRGINS, DUDE!!"
[1:04:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT
[1:04:11] <Twistedwolfie> I played 40 hours only to find out after that we can duel wield
[1:04:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Lol Lmao
[1:04:15] <%sniffy77> But Pat... what if he's legit
[1:04:17] <+alphonseisbest> wait are VIRGINS rare in this world?
[1:04:25] <digaogrunge> Time to fall in trap
[1:04:36] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ...is that what those things are called?
[1:04:38] <%delilah4you> I am not sure if I found that one or not, but the one I found just almost killed me and didnt send me anywhere, so *shrug*
[1:04:41] <%Aeoneth> I did the same Pat
[1:04:45] <+kaztinka> He might be out of line but Patches always spittin facts
[1:04:46] <%DashXero> Isn't that technically another term for "iron maiden?"
[1:04:46] <Maids4lyfe> understandable
[1:04:57] <lockhead45> Has he found the Dung eater yet? i've seen no info on that dude from anyone.
[1:04:58] <+PrinceDevian> @DashXero yes
[1:05:12] <RubberFistFight> @lockhead45 ditto. What gets me is that he's in the battle exactly long enough for him to have taken a look at the proceedings, gone "FUCKEN NOPE!!" opened his inventory and used that anti-summon item.
[1:05:16] <some_brave_apollo> you should try that iron virgin thing, sounds legit
[1:05:23] <+TheBitingIrish> How heavy is the wolf head?
[1:05:41] <+PrinceDevian> @some_brave_apollo Kappa

[1:07:06] <lockhead45> @PinkertonDanPie Or maybe Patron is the dung eater and the unnamed tarnished is someone else who is actually saving the world as Pat bumbles around?
[1:07:11] <ahmz1404> if that was true they'd need to put 200 of these
[1:07:12] <Twistedwolfie> @delilah4you ty

[1:08:28] <+silvery_cricket> Hey look a cave missed during playtesting
[1:08:28] <%DashXero> Wait. There's a lantern?! Where did Pat get a lantern?!

[1:08:33] <%pinkslimegoblin> this shit took me ages to find
[1:08:44] <ape_hawk> @DashXero a merchant
[1:08:47] <kazadaz> There's a guy on the peninsula who sells the lantern
[1:08:49] <%Valdorick> Pat use to be a play tester, Pat never would have found that cave. It all tracks psaGotcha

[1:09:16] <%DashXero> I haven't seen a single merchant selling a lantern.
[1:09:17] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt you done Nepheli's quest at the Albino village yet?
[1:09:17] <@MistyMntns> That is what she said?

[1:10:29] <MaritimeSpanker> dual-wielding scythes do look a bit silly
[1:10:35] <%delilah4you> would saying how high normal weapons scale be a spoiler?

[1:19:25] <%twistedj3ster> twistedj3ster subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! Two years! I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the input queue in this game. I can't roll-cancel animations and the input lag/timing seems crazy. Combat is kicking my ass. Anyway I hope you and your are doing well and here's to another year!
[1:19:26] <digaogrunge> Her wolf called wolf
[1:19:29] <KaitlynnHere> Nooooo, don’t leave lobo

[1:22:53] <Shiibbae> head back to the start of that dungeon ur not done
[1:23:11] <@Fuggins4U> kinda like SF
[1:23:20] <mrducksauce> It's a small frame buffer
[1:23:21] <dan_g_v> so, it's just people not being gud enough?
[1:23:30] <%delilah4you> I'm negative edging it right now XD
[1:23:32] <radiorosewater> its kinda like gooning
[1:23:41] <Sunstalker> You can?
[1:23:43] <mrducksauce> Add places?
[1:23:43] <%PrimalDweeb> Agreed
[1:23:44] <%delilah4you> radio stop
[1:23:51] <dan_g_v> huh?
[1:23:51] <+bluedude153> Like the markers?
[1:23:56] <MaritimeSpanker> whut
[1:23:59] <+0ni0n_L0rd> MORE?
[1:24:08] <MaritimeSpanker> Damm bitch, your posture is shit
[1:24:08] <Sunstalker> There's green marks and blue marks you can put down, Pat.
[1:24:08] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Oh WOW
[1:24:13] <@Fuggins4U> girl, posture
[1:24:14] <DestroPrime83> offer her a pickle
[1:24:17] <mrducksauce> uhhhh
[1:24:17] <Twistedwolfie> you can add 100 markers
[1:24:18] <%Kevlar_Caviar> that isn't her neck btw, it's a collar
[1:24:20] <mrducksauce> It sounds like a trap
[1:24:22] <+TheBitingIrish> She shrimpin real bad
[1:24:23] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i thought she had a weird neck
[1:24:26] <MaritimeSpanker> that's the "I need to take a severe dump right away" stance
[1:24:27] <RubberFistFight> why's she look so weird
[1:24:27] <vonmaultke> like the Markers and waypoints you can place on the map?
[1:24:28] <%PrimalDweeb> That' some hump to her back...
[1:24:28] <%delilah4you> Theres SO MUCH in this game!!!!
[1:24:31] <RubberFistFight> why's she standing like that
[1:24:34] <Parapattern> That woman sounds dangerously close to Salad Fingers
[1:24:34] <lockhead45> Is this Patches
[1:24:34] <%VictorVonLouche> Oh missed this and I found her in another area.
[1:24:38] <%cade_calrayn> Who’s this bitch?
[1:24:38] <andrewoid_> goblin hunch
[1:24:39] <RubberFistFight> like she needs to drop a massive shit or something
[1:24:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> She got her back blown out
[1:24:47] <%TaurusOxford> KILL HER Kappa
[1:24:50] <%noobazzazzin> uh pat there us a map u can put markers on
[1:24:54] <Shiibbae> …was it parches
[1:24:58] <%Pookiedaexzile> That bitch a demon
[1:25:01] <mrducksauce> Her angle of stance at 30 degrees makes he really sketchy as a person
[1:25:03] <%greasypete00> do you have 1000 runes pat
[1:25:03] <%mofuceo> It's not abandoned if there is someone in it.
[1:25:05] <%Broand> Right down the road
[1:25:06] <Shiibbae> Did patches steal the neck a lac
[1:25:06] <@Fuggins4U> why is she slouching like... 70 degrees
[1:25:10] <%delilah4you> This feels like some Green Knight shit
[1:25:17] <ohno58> her silly is walk is her normal walk
[1:25:24] <%Mantorok06> Right down the road
[1:25:27] <Sunstalker> If I could change anything, it would be either how Great Runes work or some of the stun build on mace tier weapons. It just doesn't work out to be able to build stun against some bosses AND be able to run back to their weak spot
[1:25:29] <@MistyMntns> @Fuggins4U Because she bowed for so long she is just like that
[1:25:35] <MaritimeSpanker> Does her silly walk blend with her germanic voice?
[1:25:35] <+alphonseisbest> did patches have a new talk option there?
[1:25:38] <RubberFistFight> @Fuggins4U she had a big weekend Kappa
[1:25:46] <%bundle_of_herbs> pat what was the talk option with patches?
[1:25:51] <chimeraxmachina> Chat lets normalise girls w bad posture
[1:25:51] <%Broand> nah he didn't
[1:25:51] <%delilah4you> Have you gotten into the city yet?
[1:25:59] <%VictorVonLouche> Its not worth it lol

[1:26:09] <@PrefectusCorgi> Has Paige applyed to the Minstory Of Silly Walk Yet
[1:26:10] <%delilah4you> Big coward energy

[1:27:52] <%PrimalDweeb> They look like a cross between a frog and an alien.
[1:27:53] <RubberFistFight> Pat's getting ready to take the knot Kappa
[1:27:54] <%Mantorok06> psaLiz
[1:27:57] <Ner234> DansGame
[1:27:58] <+alphonseisbest> VoteNay coxStare
[1:27:59] <%mofuceo> Could you just knot
[1:28:02] <MaritimeSpanker> It's all the talk of Knots
[1:28:03] <femto216> Nutting
[1:28:04] <@MistyMntns> BOOOOOO
[1:28:06] <MaritimeSpanker> Made her lose her legs
[1:28:07] <mrducksauce> she fall down from her silly walk
[1:28:09] <@MistyMntns> Feel bad for yourself
[1:28:10] <+alphonseisbest> coxWiggle
[1:28:10] <%PrimalDweeb> Again...
[1:28:15] <Shiibbae> You stop that
[1:28:16] <joodatious> its actually more advantageous to fight the sharbearers first since the reward is massive
[1:28:21] <shootybooty1> Sounds like shit my girlfriend does
[1:28:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> Peach Vs Life
[1:28:25] <%Mantorok06> NotLikeThis
[1:28:25] <tanarath> ! Paige at Risk !
[1:28:26] <Ner234> Is Paige EVER ok?
[1:28:34] <+TAFK> the destruction of Paige's body is almost complete! Soon the transformation into skeleton will be completed!

[1:28:39] <%Sirtimbob> STOP SILLY WALKING
[1:28:39] <MaybeFalco> you were in combat

[1:28:40] <mrducksauce> the grace didn't load
[1:28:43] <mrducksauce> in time
[1:28:44] <%PrimalDweeb> Because an enemy was too close
[1:28:44] <%TaurusOxford> that was odd
[1:28:52] <$vehementvadr> grace.jpeg not loaded
[1:28:53] <+RedMaskBandit> enemy nearby
[1:29:02] <RubberFistFight> [You cannot sleep while creepers are near.]

[1:29:12] <%TaurusOxford> LOBSTER BATTLE

[1:30:00] <%Sirtimbob> Pinchy!
[1:30:01] <RubberFistFight> regular sized pistol shrimps can bust through half-inch thick glass with their stupid powerful spike attack, i am not kidding
[1:30:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> Cheddar Biscuits are worth it
[1:30:04] <shootybooty1> @Pookiedaexzile crazy talk activated
[1:30:04] <%cade_calrayn> Man vs Prawn
[1:30:04] <Goatllama> Should have equipped Paper Tiger
[1:30:08] <%delilah4you> Its pretty good, but really bad if you have a shellfish allergy
[1:30:11] <%thbluewarden> the bread is good
[1:30:12] <ohno58> The biscuits are worth it alone.
[1:30:13] <AgnusLaplace> you telling me this shrimp killed pat all by itself?
[1:30:15] <RubberFistFight> they're a problem for reef aquarium owners
[1:30:15] <@PrefectusCorgi> Its alright
[1:30:23] <%ShawnTK_> Red Lobster overrated

[1:30:58] <tanarath> emotional support pig
[1:30:59] <Goatllama> lobstar said "observe"
[1:31:03] <MaritimeSpanker> if it never improves, I will cry
[1:31:07] <mrducksauce> That ps3 demo of the historic fight against a giant crab in ancient japan is amazing
[1:31:08] <FeralFozzie> Zangief can you spinning pile drive the lobster for daddy?
[1:31:09] <dan_g_v> but we need horny mods for the pc version! D=
[1:31:09] <Kungfuski> **shits
[1:31:22] <dan_g_v> like the horny fire keeper mods and such!
[1:31:28] <RubberFistFight> Fromsoft's PC ports have ALWAYS been kinda flaky at first
[1:31:41] <+alphonseisbest> Pat I think u missed a dialouge option with patches
[1:31:52] <RubberFistFight> and tbf most of their platform releases have some kind of problem. PS4 version of Sekiro was a stuttery mess on release.
[1:32:02] <joodatious> @RubberFistFight DS3 wasn't too bad. atleast by comparison
[1:32:12] <Shiibbae> Those grey dudes look so weird
[1:32:13] <%Broand> nah he saw it, it was just retelling the hint patches gave
[1:32:24] <MaybeFalco> im pretty sure pat already exhausted the dialogue
[1:32:31] <+RedMaskBandit> ohh i think the npc wants you to go to a church with red roses around it
[1:32:32] <Sir_JackalI> DS3 on Xbox One X runs kind of bad.
[1:32:38] <%PrimalDweeb> Sweet
[1:32:39] <mrducksauce> Noice
[1:32:39] <MaritimeSpanker> DOPE
[1:32:41] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> when is it chat's turn to play? :)
[1:32:41] <dan_g_v> nice
[1:32:45] <RubberFistFight> @joodatious the PC version? Nah, it had problems. Kaldaien (dude behind the nier automata fix mods) also made fixes for DS3.
[1:32:45] <+alphonseisbest> OH
[1:32:47] <joodatious> Torrent is a great horse design. very distinct
[1:32:48] <+alphonseisbest> THAT ONE
[1:32:50] <andrewoid_> that spell rocks for anything that already does bleed
[1:32:51] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Now that's a fucking name
[1:32:57] <Saltmeisterr> oh shit i missed stream
[1:32:58] <MaritimeSpanker> don't forget to read its lore later too
[1:33:01] <binku_muja_> has there been an explanation as to why tarnished eventually stop seeing grace?
[1:33:07] <kekleon020> if you tried hard enough i bet you can
[1:33:08] <FeralFozzie> bloodflame. that is so metal
[1:33:18] <+ajeanstarks78 > careful pat danger is close
[1:33:21] <RubberFistFight> b l o o d
[1:33:26] <Giztech> The Four Belfries on the left hand side of this area is something you want to check out later, it will give you access to the isolated island
[1:33:26] <Saltmeisterr> oh i hate those
[1:33:29] <MaritimeSpanker> Oh that is cool
[1:33:29] <%vivaldiva> blood? blood.
[1:33:31] <+YharnamNighthawk> uh
[1:33:33] <+alphonseisbest> BLUUUD
[1:33:35] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> DoT that builds up bleed stacks, holy shit
[1:33:35] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> the darth maul buff
[1:33:39] <+YharnamNighthawk> Isn't that just like Lady Maria's 2nd form????
[1:33:41] <%greasypete00> that spell will probably be nerfed at some point
[1:33:45] <DestroPrime83> Oh does it stack with the blood knife?
[1:33:51] <MaritimeSpanker> Ah, its mister NoMaiden himself
[1:34:01] <Kungfuski> I got slashed by a fireball
[1:34:05] <%PrimalDweeb> They sucked the big one
[1:34:10] <AgnusLaplace> why is there blood on him?
[1:34:21] <lockhead45> 3 fingers for life!
[1:34:21] <joodatious> @DestroPrime83 probably not, most unique weapon arts cant be changed
[1:34:23] <MaritimeSpanker> Is he the Kaathe in this game?
[1:34:24] <binku_muja_> no-one can be trusted in this world lets be honest.
[1:34:25] <ape_hawk> i mean, their two fingers. they cant even sign language
[1:34:30] <ape_hawk> how do they talk?
[1:34:50] <@MistyMntns> He said it! He said the Title Name!

[1:37:16] <+Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> I have discovered that Flails on Horseback are insanely OP. They are good in general but the horse takes it to a bullshit level. You can get hits while spinning up the heavy attack plus the attack itself

[1:40:45] <Tenebrae94> are you finally gonna use a rune arc pat?
[1:40:48] <%PrimalDweeb> What are the requirements for those weapons?
[1:40:48] <Ell1ot> how come Naruto runs like a penguin?

[1:41:16] <%VictorVonLouche> gank party prob
[1:41:17] <binku_muja_> Pat vs Paige.
[1:41:32] <MavMedic81> Paige wins
[1:41:33] <%VictorVonLouche> you can summon her for the fight i think
[1:41:34] <lockhead45> Boss Summon
[1:41:37] <RubberFistFight> holy shit she's BEEF
[1:41:38] <+natjen8> ya you can summon her in stormveil
[1:41:40] <lethallylactic> NPC summons are beefy
[1:41:41] <%Valdorick> Yeah, you can summon her for the boss fight
[1:41:43] <MaritimeSpanker> I wonder if the Hatman from very early in the game will be fighting pat later
[1:41:45] <HotSauceFiend> why are they running form you
[1:41:47] <MaritimeSpanker> you know, Jura
[1:41:47] <lockhead45> It was for her quest
[1:41:51] <ohno58> bodied
[1:41:57] <kekleon020> she doesnt fight invaders???
[1:41:58] <ytwitchmeng> Why not fight back?
[1:41:59] <sendart> so I guess the npc summon wasn't programmed for invaders lol
[1:42:05] <%Brassnarwhal> rip this guy's quest completion
[1:42:05] <%VictorVonLouche> mimic?
[1:42:18] <joodatious> @HotSauceFiend because fighting invaders is annoying and not fun
[1:42:28] <%Felhad> The mimic item is a reusable in here
[1:42:30] <Giztech> map check
[1:42:39] <MaritimeSpanker> You could use the "blending in mimic" thing
[1:42:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> so is Pat just demolishing noobs for funsies?
[1:42:50] <ytwitchmeng> THE PAT ALWAYS PAYS HIS DEBTS
[1:42:51] <%Felhad> spicy
[1:42:52] <%Brassnarwhal> @joodatious but it's a free 2v1 every time

[1:43:27] <%Brassnarwhal> @joodatious it's not for everyone
[1:43:29] <lockhead45> Cant you only invade someone with a summon unless that person uses an item to make it fair?
[1:43:30] <+alphonseisbest> btw How does pvp work in ER, can u invade anyone? @PatStaresAt
[1:43:32] <RubberFistFight> wait ok so why is pat burning all 5 of this things?
[1:43:32] <%strakillias> He killed two both times
[1:43:32] <%Felhad> unless they use the tongue item that lets you get solo invaded
[1:43:32] <Sol_Install> by red
[1:43:38] <Sol_Install> bye*
[1:43:38] <RubberFistFight> i missed whatever the leadup was for this
[1:43:40] <%Cozy90> are we just invading for fun or going after something?
[1:43:47] <mental_mashup> I’m surround by fear and dead men
[1:43:52] <ytwitchmeng> Hey Pat can you give us your "Game of Thrones House saying/slogan"
[1:43:56] <+RedMaskBandit> did u not see Pat's vid of him getting bodied in a gank trap
[1:43:56] <digaogrunge> @RubberFistFight quest
[1:44:05] <%Valdorick> Oh huh, Invaders have their own boss theme LUL
[1:44:06] <RubberFistFight> @Cozy90 someone mentioned "you have to burn all 5" so my guess is he's going for something
[1:44:11] <%PrimalDweeb> Is there any cost to invading?
[1:44:19] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight ooh, which one? i've not gotten on this one myself yet
[1:44:20] <mental_mashup> I think it’s high because people pump weapon stats early over vigor
[1:44:23] <%greasypete00> wow that's really good for players huh
[1:44:27] <binku_muja_> @RubberFistFight i think the dude progresses the conversation. at least thats the suspicion.
[1:44:30] <%notsoy> rekt
[1:44:31] <%TaurusOxford> awwwww

[1:44:40] <%PrimalDweeb> F
[1:44:42] <RubberFistFight> hey he was stacking madness
[1:44:43] <%delilah4you> I just really hate that it only invades cooperators.
[1:44:47] <%MartinOfLoxley> Good job, Tarnished
[1:44:47] <%delilah4you> Give me one good one on one
[1:44:48] <%Brassnarwhal> close fight
[1:44:50] <+alphonseisbest> can u only invade people who opt into it?
[1:44:59] <%Valdorick> psaOrb
[1:44:59] <ohno58> You get boss music now
[1:45:04] <ytwitchmeng> What is House Bouveine's slogan?
[1:45:06] <%delilah4you> oh did they fix that?
[1:45:08] <%mrgaster8> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[1:45:09] <joodatious> lmao it was dumb
[1:45:11] <%delilah4you> If they fixed that thats not.....as bad
[1:45:18] <binku_muja_> So it was a gang bang with no fair odds to the invaded person?
[1:45:19] <MaritimeSpanker> could also very easily invade people on a higher New game + than yours
[1:45:23] <digaogrunge> You can opt in to be invaded solo
[1:45:23] <%VictorVonLouche> DS3 you just camp bonfires and SUMMON INFINITE HELPERS
[1:45:26] <joodatious> thats why the redsoap stone stuff was way better
[1:45:29] <%delilah4you> I remember trying to finvade and just getting RUNDOWN
[1:45:30] <RubberFistFight> I'm glad they fixed Gravelording for DS:R
[1:45:32] <ohno58> Well that's what you get for being and invading asshole. you get ganked
[1:45:34] <radiorosewater> birds should follow
[1:45:35] <RubberFistFight> coz that shit's fun
[1:45:40] <%miabyte> I got invaded here and hid on the roof
[1:45:43] <%greasypete00> is there no red eye orb equivalent in this game, so far I've only seen the single use ones
[1:45:45] <%Valdorick> They using item mimic?
[1:45:52] <PenguinPall> Thanks for showing me the wolf girl quest! This game has sooo many things you can miss
[1:45:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @delilah4you it isnt a bug it was a conscious decision i wouldn't call changing it fixing it, i personally like that it ads risk to getting help with zones
[1:45:57] <$Smokay17> Can you use the prop hunt items in invading?
[1:45:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @greasypete00 you get one in midgame
[1:46:01] <+twdlrr> fuckin trying to farm wolfblade swordgrass and a whole gang rolls up
[1:46:09] <andrewoid_> the loss is super low for hosts now too, maybe souls if you're dumb just cuz remedies are so plentiful and cheap
[1:46:15] <%MartinOfLoxley> So does the game not give you a general direction?
[1:46:17] <%Brassnarwhal> @smokay17 you could in 3
[1:46:18] <andrewoid_> i recall embers being annoying early on
[1:46:30] <%Valdorick> Wow LUL
[1:46:31] <%delilah4you> but if you have 3 or more helpers it doesnt add risk for them it just outright makes it trivial
[1:46:46] <%Brassnarwhal> that spell is sick
[1:46:54] <dan_g_v> uh oh
[1:46:54] <%VictorVonLouche> Gang squading lol
[1:46:55] <%delilah4you> Unless you are a god pvper, having to fight 3 or 4 dudes at once is usually gonna be a deathsetence
[1:46:56] <MaritimeSpanker> 3 Vs 1
[1:46:57] <%VictorVonLouche> Gank*
[1:46:58] <MaritimeSpanker> goddamm
[1:47:00] <%Valdorick> Oh, this is preset gank squad it looks like.
[1:47:00] <%MartinOfLoxley> 3v1 is rough
[1:47:01] <MaritimeSpanker> OH
[1:47:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I am actively cheering against Pat lol
[1:47:07] <MaritimeSpanker> Yeah that evens some odds a little
[1:47:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @delilah4you if they have more than 3 helpers you invaded a havker
[1:47:12] <andrewoid_> giant hits you too ;_;
[1:47:13] <RubberFistFight> they saw you comin dude lol
[1:47:15] <dan_g_v> I'm not sure
[1:47:16] <+alphonseisbest> wow the Giant FUCKED u
[1:47:17] <%machshop> that was cool tho
[1:47:18] <manateeworkshop> that was a lot going on
[1:47:18] <ALazo> betrayed by giant
[1:47:21] <%TaurusOxford> @TurtlesAndTentacles shameful. Kappa
[1:47:21] <%MartinOfLoxley> Yeah, they set you up
[1:47:25] <%ruben8802> david v goliath
[1:47:27] <%VictorVonLouche> Sitting in a room trying to just jump you
[1:47:36] <%delilah4you> but thats what he's saying, they would only match you up in PVP with people who had 4 or more summons
[1:47:39] <%Cozy90> Hey pat what are you invading for? funsies or an item?>
[1:47:39] <%delilah4you> Constantly
[1:47:42] <digaogrunge> Gankers
[1:47:42] <+RedMaskBandit> that giant messed u up
[1:47:48] <%delilah4you> PAt is a monster
[1:47:49] <%Cozy90> o
[1:47:49] <joodatious> invader items only being used on actual invasion is amazing
[1:47:52] <%Valdorick> You mean... Rotten Dragon's Breath?
[1:47:59] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @taurusoxford lol. he's too strong lol
[1:48:01] <jbrachob> a finger orb
[1:48:03] <%pinkslimegoblin> nah you get it later
[1:48:03] <%Sirtimbob> Why are you doing 5?

[1:48:08] <+Walopoh> wtf it still charged you
[1:48:09] <SeaReally> lol
[1:48:11] <%MartinOfLoxley> How much do those cost?
[1:48:20] <%Felhad> 1k each
[1:48:27] <%Brassnarwhal> @delilah4you i meant in this not in 3 they arent gonna change anything in ds3 at this point its been years
[1:48:30] <%delilah4you> you can probably eventually make them
[1:48:33] <%delilah4you> If I had to guess
[1:48:36] <+Walopoh> super dumb it doesn't refund you
[1:48:37] <+alphonseisbest> is there Sunbro like gang in this?
[1:48:43] <%YakumoYomi> You are a full orb, Pat
[1:48:44] <+alphonseisbest> ye
[1:48:44] <%delilah4you> Thats what I was talking about too I'm confused now
[1:48:46] <MaritimeSpanker> yes
[1:48:47] <andrewoid_> unlimited finger
[1:48:50] <saraizarai> full gnarly finger?
[1:48:51] <%Brassnarwhal> and ds3 allowed fight clubs
[1:48:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> no
[1:48:51] <+alphonseisbest> Invading ORB
[1:48:52] <%Valdorick> psaOrb
[1:48:54] <+alphonseisbest> IORB
[1:48:54] <MaritimeSpanker> the red eye orb instead of the red eye fragment
[1:48:57] <TechnocoloredCat> the tool not the consumables
[1:49:00] <%mrgaster8> naw
[1:49:03] <razz_zie> U already have a full orb tho, Pat
[1:49:06] <dan_g_v> this seems different
[1:49:09] <+alphonseisbest> the RORB if u will
[1:49:15] <lethallylactic> Ayy lmao
[1:49:20] <mental_mashup> It’d just be a hand tho not an orb?
[1:49:22] <+alphonseisbest> @razz_zie but more ORB tho
[1:49:24] <%VictorVonLouche> Yeah, probably not cause I got it and its pretty far in.
[1:49:25] <binku_muja_> what's the point of fighting him? You don't get anything of worth.
[1:49:26] <%delilah4you> maybe he drops his set?
[1:49:27] <mental_mashup> Cause they’re fingers
[1:49:28] <joodatious> he's an enemy pat
[1:49:28] <%TaurusOxford> maybe you can farm his weapon?
[1:49:31] <%Valdorick> If the item is a finger... then wouldn't it be a Full Hand? Kappa
[1:49:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat, I don'teven know what fingers are

[1:51:15] <%Sirtimbob> Ruh roh
[1:51:19] <Giztech> blind berry lady @PatStaresAt
[1:51:19] <%heychaney> hunched back lady?
[1:51:20] <dan_g_v> the blind girls mentioned they could have been maidens, no?
[1:51:20] <%dmbender> No maidens :(
[1:51:22] <jbrachob> the blind chick?
[1:51:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nope
[1:51:25] <$vehementvadr> pat you can't do this to paige
[1:51:28] <%Brassnarwhal> the blind lady isnt a maiden yet
[1:51:29] <+Walopoh> how will he even know it's a maiden's blood?
[1:51:29] <CH3F015> the blind lady who neededgrapes
[1:51:30] <%greasypete00> grape lady is a maiden
[1:51:32] <binku_muja_> Pat no, don't, it can't be worth it. And yes, you do, the chick asking for gross ass eyeballs and calling them grapes.
[1:51:32] <alroy909> this guy is clearly just some incel
[1:51:37] <lockhead45> check the item he gave you
[1:51:37] <IminyourBase> just put your own blood on it and tell him it's maiden blood. he'll never know
[1:51:38] <%SpontaneousC> Eyeball girl is on a quest to BECOME a maiden, I doubt she counts until her questline ends
[1:51:45] <%Brassnarwhal> she says the grapes are gonna help her become a maiden
[1:51:47] <femto216> Blond lady
[1:51:48] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat can do 6 spells now. Nice
[1:52:07] <trasherxl> maybe crooked woman who wants medallion is maiden?
[1:52:15] <%cade_calrayn> Grape girl but she’s inaccessible til after the Academy
[1:52:19] <ape_hawk> hey, apparently dimaggio is gonna voice bender after all
[1:52:23] <%Broand> gimme dat arcane scaling tho
[1:52:23] <ape_hawk> whoopdedoo
[1:52:31] <%notsoy> they resolved that? good shit
[1:52:32] <%delilah4you> The spell system in this game is kind of like the 5e spell system. Kind of
[1:52:53] <jubejube56> Could kill the sorcerer teacher again :p
[1:52:54] <%bundle_of_herbs> @PatStaresAt don't forget to talk to patches again
[1:52:58] <lockhead45> did you read the item the invader guy gave you?
[1:53:00] <binku_muja_> do we know why tarnished stop seeing grace? they made a big song and dance about it but nothing explaining why.
[1:53:00] <joodatious> @delilah4you what how?
[1:53:02] <+natjen8> @delilah4you how so?
[1:53:09] <+alphonseisbest> would u say ur running a lich or a fallen PLD? pat
[1:53:13] <+xerj> the older games literally had vancian spell casting
[1:53:15] <joodatious> the boss in there is REALLY good pat
[1:53:19] <+alphonseisbest> he had a dialogue
[1:53:22] <joodatious> one of my favorites so far
[1:53:23] <+alphonseisbest> u missed
[1:53:23] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> dialog
[1:53:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @binku_muja_ it seems to be akin to hollowing out
[1:53:30] <signofzeta> because patches is your best friend
[1:53:38] <+RedMaskBandit> he's lonely
[1:53:43] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat's gonna forget again
[1:53:43] <ARandomBlkGuy> did he fight the deathbird by patches
[1:53:45] <binku_muja_> supposedly you can bring the sorceress back to life when you repent. whatever the hell that means.
[1:53:48] <%machshop> i think he just tells you about the iron virgin again
[1:53:49] <%delilah4you> If you look at your FP as kind of like spell slots, in that you have a certain amount of FP to cast spells, and you can pick any spell you've slotted to cast, as long as you have the FP/level of the spell
[1:53:55] <%Broand> @alphonseisbest That dialog is retelling the hint from earlier
[1:53:55] <IminyourBase> is this anor lando?
[1:54:10] <%greasypete00> this things weapon art is really good
[1:54:13] <lethallylactic> That's the axe that one host was using
[1:54:18] <+alphonseisbest> @Broand oh my b then
[1:54:20] <lethallylactic> Hoarfrost Stomp is legitimately broken
[1:54:25] <Rbeatononefour> sick weapon
[1:54:25] <%OminousOwle> i opened thatg chest the exact moment you did
[1:54:26] <%Brassnarwhal> @delilah4you ds1 had like literal spell slot type functions with the limited casts
[1:54:33] <binku_muja_> @Brassnarwhal thank you!
[1:54:37] <joodatious> glad they put more stuff into frost in elden ring. it was very underwhelming in DS3
[1:54:42] <+anoldtoilet> lmao the cartwheel
[1:54:42] <Ner234> Hoarfrost Stomp is pretty strong
[1:54:42] <lethallylactic> BONKED
[1:54:44] <lethallylactic> BOP
[1:54:44] <+alphonseisbest> oof
[1:54:46] <+anoldtoilet> ayyyy
[1:54:47] <%Broand> thats a big fella
[1:54:48] <bigben01> Lmfao
[1:54:51] <+natjen8> the albinaurics aint fking aroun
[1:54:54] <+SilverDevilfish> Jiren strong Kappa
[1:54:55] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> it looked dead into the camera
[1:54:56] <%Cozy90> what level is pat?
[1:54:56] <wolfen091> flood house for more damage
[1:54:56] <Ner234> BOP
[1:54:59] <%delilah4you> Yeah Brass, that was more akin to 3.5e spellcasting
[1:55:03] <%Brassnarwhal> that's a lotta damage
[1:55:03] <%YakumoYomi> Boss nearby?
[1:55:05] <+jacksawjack> Pat got Patted by a Pat.
[1:55:06] <IminyourBase> 'Merica Steak?
[1:55:11] <%greasypete00> there's maybe a nighttime boss?
[1:55:12] <+natjen8> i noticed that stake of merika is at basically like every ruins i think
[1:55:17] <%delilah4you> Where you have a SLOT and you can cast the spells in that SLOT
[1:55:18] <%Brassnarwhal> @delilah4you never messed with 3.5 that's interesting
[1:55:20] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:55:20] <joodatious> nice one pat
[1:55:24] <+RedMaskBandit> it's just a farm spot
[1:55:25] <Giztech> yea night time boss
[1:55:27] <+alphonseisbest> see
[1:55:31] <lethallylactic> This alien's got yer number
[1:55:39] <+CarrowayFashonti> Did pat just get bodied by Hans Moleman
[1:55:39] <Rbeatononefour> get whomped lmao
[1:55:43] <%Brassnarwhal> @natjen8 almost anywhere they think will require multiple attempts
[1:55:55] <%delilah4you> I'm not a fan of the 3.5e system, but I LOVE the 5e system, its so much more flexible and enjoyable
[1:55:57] <+jacksawjack> Summon Zangeif
[1:56:04] <%Brassnarwhal> i find that frustrating
[1:56:07] <%greasypete00> maybe it stays if you respawn at a stake? I never paid attention to it
[1:56:08] <saraizarai> you said to think of Patches
[1:56:10] <tanarath> Patches
[1:56:11] <binku_muja_> that enemy reminds of that that moon faced puppet guy from nier.
[1:56:13] <+anoldtoilet> 5e is just like, 3.5 but worse though
[1:56:16] <%Brassnarwhal> the time progressing thing
[1:56:27] <+anoldtoilet> its just hey, what if we went even MORE unbalanced and explained LESS
[1:56:27] <ape_hawk> i didnt even do anything!\
[1:56:29] <%machshop> hey i said he'd just repeat himself
[1:56:30] <%dyedeme> dyedeme subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[1:56:32] <digaogrunge> @delilah4you 3.5 sorcs ARE the 5e system
[1:56:35] <+alphonseisbest> oh
[1:56:36] <terrible35> prepare the shamecube
[1:56:37] <+alphonseisbest> welp
[1:56:38] <Ner234> You won't D:
[1:56:41] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I mean pat you keep running away when they have more to say
[1:56:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> B..but i didnt say anything
[1:56:49] <+RedMaskBandit> I like 5e, it has a lot of strengths. I never played the older ones because I'm not old af
[1:56:49] <+alphonseisbest> T_T
[1:56:53] <ape_hawk> pat, YOURE in the shamecube
[1:56:53] <%delilah4you> Not really, they just have more slots but less learned spells
[1:56:54] <%TheAdMerlin> I said nothing, I am free of the cube
[1:56:55] <binku_muja_> so, are we killing patches at the end of the game or are you going to let him live?
[1:56:58] <joodatious> @anoldtoilet 5e is 3.5 but playable
[1:57:02] <$vehementvadr> who said it I'm going to commit minecraft war crimes
[1:57:05] <%tetraes> jokes on you i never left the shame cube
[1:57:06] <%Cozy90> anyone know where to get more seedbeds?
[1:57:06] <%Broand> none have more sharper eyes than I
[1:57:08] <%Brassnarwhal> @anoldtoilet that's something that almost exclusively is said by d&d gatekeppers cause 5e is actually comprehensible to new players
[1:57:08] <%delilah4you> basically
[1:57:09] <+anoldtoilet> no its not
[1:57:13] <MajesticBonfire> :Z
[1:57:19] <+anoldtoilet> its 3.5 but CR is broken and it has less stuff for players to do
[1:57:21] <dan_g_v> wha
[1:57:25] <Giztech> hit it with range attack
[1:57:32] <%Broand> It might be a teleporting one
[1:57:33] <TheGuesty> sneak up on it?
[1:57:36] <MaybeFalco> visions of ranged attack
[1:57:36] <%delilah4you> Disagree, but agree to disagree
[1:57:37] <$vehementvadr> because fuck you it's magic
[1:57:38] <+anoldtoilet> is it? because it isnt to anyone ive played it with
[1:57:38] <+ajeanstarks78 > try range
[1:57:43] <joodatious> @anoldtoilet CR has always been broken lmao
[1:57:43] <Rbeatononefour> its an Abra
[1:57:46] <digaogrunge> he teleports
[1:57:47] <dan_g_v> beholders?
[1:57:47] <Giztech> otherwise it will move around the island
[1:57:51] <jmft2000> It doesn't dissapear forever
[1:57:52] <binku_muja_> LUL
[1:57:54] <+anoldtoilet> its never been more broken
[1:57:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @anoldtoilet cause it hasn't had 20 years of additional rulebooks released for it yet
[1:57:58] <MillaMoks> @anoldtoilet Yep, and for some reason they decided that the term "priceless" when applied to magic items should be taken literally in 5e
[1:58:02] <binku_muja_> boy is that a touchy hitbox.
[1:58:03] <RubberFistFight> oh hey it's this area
[1:58:03] <+anoldtoilet> actually it worked perfectly fine in 4e.
[1:58:04] <RubberFistFight> have fun
[1:58:05] <%dmbender> Zerg overlords Pog
[1:58:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GO TO ROCK
[1:58:16] <%cade_calrayn> these scarabs have been working out, Pat
[1:58:21] <lethallylactic> dargon
[1:58:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @anoldtoilet and everyone loves 4e lmao
[1:58:29] <%delilah4you> I like that a lot of 5e design is based around common sense
[1:58:29] <+xerj> Can't even avoid D&D edition wars in a video game stream, shame
[1:58:30] <luciluxlu0> eat it's heart
[1:58:33] <+ajeanstarks78 > it telaport to different spot not disappearing.
[1:58:38] <+anoldtoilet> everyone whos actually played it likes it lol
[1:58:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That dragon has something vital to progress
[1:58:51] <+anoldtoilet> if youve read forum posts about it being like wow da video game, sure its bad.
[1:59:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh yeah, did you ever find that dragon that turned invisible and fucked off? @PatStaresAt
[1:59:09] <+RedMaskBandit> Yeah the magic item economy in 5e is bonkers but I make it work in my table
[1:59:14] <joodatious> @xerj I mean these games are influenced heavily on tabletop games like dnd
[1:59:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @anoldtoilet that's not what the internet and the people i know say lol, the reason 3.5 had such a long life is cause people didnt like 4e
[1:59:24] <ArgentUndaCova> Yo, how did Pat get that Carian Retaliation? evo18MindBlown
[1:59:24] <RubberFistFight> @Hunk_Of_Dunk she comes back later apparently
[1:59:27] <%delilah4you> Yeah I was gonna say that
[1:59:29] <RubberFistFight> kind of like midir fucking off for a bit
[1:59:30] <+anoldtoilet> yeah im sorry for edition warring. i like every edition but 5e
[1:59:30] <@Fuggins4U> Smarag!
[1:59:37] <%YakumoYomi> I thought it said "Smaugh" for a second
[1:59:41] <+anoldtoilet> its all fun games but 5 is just legit broken and the designers didnt care about it
[1:59:42] <Giztech> he is also protecting a key item
[1:59:45] <%dmbender> damn its Smaug
[1:59:48] <%delilah4you> If you didnt expect talk about dnd in a fantasy action rpg game channel, I dont know what to tell you
[1:59:49] <%Broand> It's puff the magic dragon
[1:59:49] <+tizziks> Oh dang, it's Samauauauag
[1:59:49] <Ner234> Is this the one that ran away?
[1:59:50] <MaybeFalco> from downtown thats where
[1:59:53] <kirbykyodai> shoulda called it a wyvern
[1:59:57] <%delilah4you> Get the key item and run away like a coward
[1:59:59] <%dmbender> the key item is his heart!
[2:00:00] <binku_muja_> damn. that dragon's not messing around with that kind of damage.
[2:00:01] <+anoldtoilet> @Brassnarwhal 4e lasted longer and sold more
[2:00:02] <dan_g_v> no way
[2:00:03] <%dmbender> rip that shit out
[2:00:04] <+anoldtoilet> anyway never mind
[2:00:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yep
[2:00:13] <%cade_calrayn> No, this is a *different* Glinstone Dragon
[2:00:15] <+alphonseisbest> OLEG
[2:00:19] <%cade_calrayn> Adula is the one that ran away
[2:00:22] <+alphonseisbest> Clap clap clap
[2:00:22] <joodatious> @Brassnarwhal 5e is still selling tho that logic makes no sense
[2:00:26] <RubberFistFight> @anoldtoilet all editions have been "broken" in some way. See: the peasant railgun and the bag of holding shit.
[2:00:28] <+anoldtoilet> nice
[2:00:29] <%Brassnarwhal> i still don't know how to deal with the blue fire yet the aoe is enormous and taller than my horse can jump
[2:00:29] <Midnight188> smaug?
[2:00:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> ooooleg
[2:00:33] <joodatious> literally ongoing
[2:00:35] <dan_g_v> I don't think he likes magic
[2:00:35] <%cade_calrayn> jesus that's a lot of damage
[2:00:39] <binku_muja_> blue glowing eyes?
[2:00:43] <+ajeanstarks78 > bugs got nothing it's a trap
[2:00:52] <+RedMaskBandit> you're talking about an outdated ttrpg in a stream about a video game. slightly different
[2:00:55] <Ghufufin> try out the new archer summon?
[2:01:02] <+tizziks> summon archer lady!
[2:01:09] <%Brassnarwhal> @joodatious what? i was defending 5e i was talking about 4 being bad i think 5 is awesome cause anyone can play it
[2:01:10] <femto216> Gwyn must be proud
[2:01:15] <Ghufufin> blue eyes? white dragon?!
[2:01:16] <+anoldtoilet> peasant railgun has always been a gm interpretation that doesnt actually function in the rules. it transports an item quickly but doesnt grant it any momentum
[2:01:21] <+anoldtoilet> anyone can play any of them
[2:01:23] <digaogrunge> 4e has the best grid-based combat of all editions, people were just salty that 3.5 died
[2:01:38] <+anoldtoilet> any edition is very beginner friendly if you start at level 1 and the gm knows how to run it
[2:01:46] <+dmbender> @anoldtoilet if you do peasant railgun just have it do 1d4 damage as an improvised weapon lmao
[2:01:48] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> isn't that the one who ran long ago?
[2:01:50] <+anoldtoilet> 1 and 2 are fun in different ways as well
[2:01:53] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[2:01:58] <zhenthrim213> no
[2:02:05] <RubberFistFight> @anoldtoilet Amazing how you're willing to make excuses for your favourite implementation while condeming one you don't like for trivial shit. Kappa
[2:02:06] <joodatious> @digaogrunge I just dont think people liked how gamey it was. it was more based on powers and less about roleplay
[2:02:10] <zhenthrim213> soulmass
[2:02:12] <%cade_calrayn> @TurtlesAndTentacles that was Adula
[2:02:14] <@Spydurman> Hey can y'all calm down on the 5e vs 4e vs 3.5e stuff. Kinda clogging up chat
[2:02:14] <binku_muja_> that attack looked like he fired his snot at you.
[2:02:25] <%Brassnarwhal> @anoldtoilet if they take a college course in 30 year old nerd shit sure, youre being obtuse for no reason, the older editions are very hard to learn especially if you dont have any friends that play
[2:02:28] <+alphonseisbest> YEYEYE Fuck'em up pat
[2:02:32] <Ghufufin> the edition wars never end...
[2:02:37] <+anoldtoilet> @anoldtoilet im not condemning the peasant railgun im just saying how it works
[2:02:43] <+alphonseisbest> ayyyyyyyy
[2:02:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> I should level my magic
[2:02:46] <@Fuggins4U> dragon: cheesed
[2:02:47] <Profmcstevie> Take it to a fucking resetera forum holy fuck nerds
[2:02:50] <RubberFistFight> @Brassnarwhal a 4e loyalist being obtuse for no reason? say it aint so. :P
[2:02:51] <%delilah4you> The edition wars are forever
[2:02:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Chat anyone keeping a tally of how many times pat calls an enemy dipshit and they fuck him up or almost fuck him up
[2:02:51] <joodatious> dramgyun
[2:02:52] <@Spydurman> fuck ya
[2:02:56] <MaybeFalco> dont forget to carve
[2:02:58] <%delilah4you> Also congrats on 14k souls
[2:03:00] <+anoldtoilet> @Brassnarwhal if you dont have any friends that play 5e is exactly as hard to learn as 3.5 or 2.
[2:03:03] <+anoldtoilet> probably harder than 1
[2:03:07] <digaogrunge> @digaogrunge Good Gms take care of that part... no DnD edition has a focus on roleplay, Its a game about combat
[2:03:07] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @cade_calrayn I stand corrected

[2:09:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> who knew
[2:09:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> So, did that sith greatsword dude drop his flying glowing sword that was sick as shit? I would hope so, it's sick as fuck
[2:09:27] <joodatious> either go to the Volcano or Caelid after the academy
[2:09:28] <ape_hawk> ghosts have no blood? how cringe
[2:09:30] <%delilah4you> oh, i just assumed cuz your health was so low
[2:09:45] <+alphonseisbest> can u even get that Sith sword?
[2:09:45] <DestroPrime83> Ghosts are renouned for their lack of blood
[2:09:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:09:52] <%Brassnarwhal> @joodatious very helpful, I can't get into any of the new zones i get blown up by giant explosive arrow shots from nowhere
[2:09:52] <%cade_calrayn> *imbued*
[2:09:55] <%delilah4you> imbued, not regular ones
[2:09:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> special keys
[2:09:56] <%PrimalDweeb> I wonder if we can get ghost armor? That'd be really awesome.
[2:09:57] <%cade_calrayn> Yup!
[2:09:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> different keys needed
[2:10:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> u gotta kill him elsewhere for the sword
[2:10:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> u kno it
[2:10:20] <%cade_calrayn> Nope, not all four
[2:10:23] <%Order_of_Mystery> @BallerSwagBro9k the bell hunter dude?
[2:10:24] <Rbeatononefour> bet those special keys are in the city...
[2:10:27] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[2:10:28] <%cade_calrayn> this bitch needs to go away lol
[2:10:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @joodatious volcano has a tower that makes me suffer madness and every enemy in caelid is very clearly out of my range currently
[2:10:32] <+alphonseisbest> @BallerSwagBro9k oh he shows back up again?
[2:10:33] <dan_g_v> the non bleeding ghost caught you!
[2:10:34] <joodatious> the running attack is so shit
[2:10:34] <binku_muja_> ho boy, he wasn't giving up there.
[2:10:39] <TheGuesty> wow he was on your ass like a hemorrhoid
[2:10:41] <%cade_calrayn> the fourth and topmost is different
[2:10:42] <@Spydurman> on your ass, jesus
[2:10:43] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> lul
[2:10:46] <MaybeFalco> literally left you in a pile of blood, evaporated
[2:10:47] <+orientaloso> thin k theres a key up top
[2:10:53] <Giztech> @PatStaresAt when you get a key make sure to open the top most right portal
[2:10:55] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @BallerSwagBro9k I figured. Someone mentioned to pat the other day that he can show up in multiple spots, so I guess it does make sense that different spots he shows up drop different things. I hope it still does the levitation shit on the player version
[2:11:01] <%blankwaffle> he tried to fuck on you
[2:11:09] <%VictorVonLouche> there's a key and grace up there
[2:11:14] <%cade_calrayn> No, open the *bottommost* portal
[2:11:16] <%delilah4you> The ref tried to fuck on me!
[2:11:17] <joodatious> @Brassnarwhal then you probably need items or gear the defends against madness
[2:11:18] <@Fuggins4U> @blankwaffle WHERE'S THAT REFEREE
[2:11:26] <MaybeFalco> the top one is the best one
[2:11:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> I bet they all lead to their own special brand of hell
[2:11:33] <%Broand> Try opening the portal to scrimbo
[2:11:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> holy shit i just did something that gave me 5 dragon hearts
[2:11:34] <%Cozy90> how far is pat in here?
[2:11:36] <%cade_calrayn> The other two keys are elsewhere, yes
[2:11:45] <andrewoid_> if you want an easy solution for the cloth right now, do go with the furthest up (which is the easternmost) belfry
[2:11:52] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt read all the messages near the portals
[2:12:10] <%cade_calrayn> All three portals are great, I just think you'll enjoy the lower one the most.
[2:12:44] <%Broand> Oh thats... the starting zone?
[2:12:44] <%greasypete00> I went to the precipice and got some cool things

[2:15:47] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is why there's giant chunks of buildings everywhere
[2:15:49] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt Given how every one of your predictions works that'll be the mid point
[2:15:55] <Notsocleveruser> Well time to tab out
[2:15:58] <%Brassnarwhal> oh fuck the sky temple wasn't a lie
[2:16:00] <dan_g_v> those look like giant bones
[2:16:02] <DestroPrime83> I love the quiet ambients
[2:16:05] <%cade_calrayn> YUP
[2:16:06] <femto216> I want a sea level
[2:16:06] <beaowolfe> Is it?? you've seen like 2 other places that looks like they could of been the end of the game
[2:16:08] <%TG_Cid11> lol
[2:16:10] <%greasypete00> is this farum azula
[2:16:10] <%cade_calrayn> The Beastman of Farum Azula
[2:16:12] <joodatious> welcome
[2:16:15] <%YakumoYomi> The Beastman of Farum Azula
[2:16:19] <%PrimalDweeb> Is every enemy going to be a former boss?
[2:16:20] <%cade_calrayn> It is indeed
[2:16:22] <dan_g_v> wait, so the demi humans come from the sky?
[2:16:26] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat if you have any Sanctuary Stone, you should read the description. It's a crafting material
[2:16:36] <%cade_calrayn> So something fucked happened to Farum Azula
[2:16:38] <%Brassnarwhal> he was the dickhead of the fast swings
[2:16:38] <leaplearning> @PatStaresAt you gonna spend those 16K+ runes?
[2:16:45] <%Broand> oh well I think I know where another key is at least
[2:16:48] <deviljhojho_> yeah something not ideal
[2:16:49] <%cade_calrayn> and it like.... exploded all over the Lands Between?
[2:16:56] <MaybeFalco> its almost like something shattered there
[2:16:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> need many rune
[2:16:59] <+jacksawjack> Wario lit a fart
[2:17:06] <terrible35> numbers, how do they work
[2:17:17] <%JoshManVGH> Hard confirm
[2:17:19] <42nfl19> is that a TORNADO?
[2:17:26] <andrewoid_> one or two
[2:17:32] <%cade_calrayn> are those dragons or just winged bat things? I couldn't tell
[2:17:34] <%nanaki_ff14> I remember shitting myself when I came here
[2:17:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hellnado
[2:17:45] <%JustToWatch> that's at least 7 dragons
[2:17:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This is literally the last MANDATORY zone b4 beating the game
[2:17:55] <%Brassnarwhal> Draconado
[2:17:56] <+stellarseeker> Cowardice?
[2:17:58] <%JoshManVGH> That Night of Dark Blades REALLY fucked up the world it seems, holy shit.
[2:18:00] <MaybeFalco> definitely come back later type of fight
[2:18:01] <Rbeatononefour> rly needs a stake of Marike
[2:18:02] <+alphonseisbest> run past till u find a ggace?
[2:18:02] <deviljhojho_> 2 hits and you're out
[2:18:03] <%PrimalDweeb> This is already annoying, and I'm not even playing. LUL
[2:18:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> something tells me you might be under leveled for this
[2:18:03] <joodatious> probably good to run to find grace
[2:18:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @ballerswagbro9k someone else said it was optional
[2:18:14] <%jamsbybetty> plink them with ranged from above
[2:18:21] <%bundle_of_herbs> can you lightning them from the top?
[2:18:31] <peachy996> why not a femaelstrom?
[2:18:32] <%PrimalDweeb> Those enemy's are going to piss me off.
[2:18:36] <%baka_sugoi> ooo
[2:18:38] <%JoshManVGH> What?
[2:18:40] <%cade_calrayn> Oh really?!
[2:18:42] <%Kevlar_Caviar> what makes you think that?
[2:18:43] <%greasypete00> this feels like Miyazaki's original vision for ds1
[2:18:44] <thesaverofhumens> hes right, the concept art was identical
[2:18:45] <femto216> I want shark enemies
[2:18:46] <dan_g_v> the converging lands and all that
[2:18:46] <+alphonseisbest> i don't get it
[2:18:48] <%nanaki_ff14> Did you check the map?
[2:18:48] <+gag5y> PLATFORMING

[2:19:52] <%nanaki_ff14> I used the that faith greatbow and the shots knocked them off
[2:19:53] <@Spydurman> holy shit
[2:20:02] <Kain5707> hmmm I wonder if this is an endgame area Pat
[2:20:03] <Ner234> Zeus 'Em

[2:20:23] <%delilah4you> That dude got over there QUICK
[2:20:23] <%cade_calrayn> I *think* the towers you see off in the distance on the left are the coastline of the main areas
[2:20:25] <TheSphereHunter> have you met Radahn yet?
[2:20:25] <%TG_Cid11> just leave and come back later pat

[2:20:38] <deviljhojho_> i heard he is a ballbuster
[2:20:38] <%PrimalDweeb> No grace
[2:20:47] <%delilah4you> losing souls is cringe, but being cringe makes you free
[2:20:48] <MaybeFalco> dont worry, theres a farm spot later on where you can get like 19k in like 4 minutes
[2:20:55] <dan_g_v> has Pat even stepped into the very bad no good red land?
[2:20:59] <deviljhojho_> as long as it works right
[2:21:00] <zhenthrim213> @TheSphereHunter i just got done with rahdan
[2:21:03] <+imthewisejanitor> Return to cringe
[2:21:05] <%VictorVonLouche> Pat's a coward to his zone lol

[2:21:08] <%JustToWatch> Pat lookout, there's beastmen
[2:21:13] <Kain5707> @thespherehunter should he be 2nd on the list I have that option now but I'm not sure if I want to start it yet
[2:21:24] <%cade_calrayn> @dan_g_v he was sent to Hell within the first few hours of his first stream by a chest
[2:21:27] <knotsundownsyndrome> i've never seen this portal, this is more fucked up than the one in the weeping peninsula
[2:21:27] <@Spydurman> kudos to @cade_calrayn for a good recommendation on where to go
[2:21:28] <%Cozy90> anyone know hat level pat is?
[2:21:30] <MaybeFalco> watch out
[2:21:34] <KasiCrafter> I wonder how viable just pushing these mobs into the void is
[2:21:35] <%nanaki_ff14> Do you have that Faith Greatbow? The shots knock them off
[2:21:36] <%cade_calrayn> *bows*

[2:22:23] <Rbeatononefour> and yet
[2:22:25] <%cade_calrayn> it can be two things
[2:22:25] <%Brassnarwhal> nice save
[2:22:27] <%PrimalDweeb> Seems plausible

[2:24:02] <Kain5707> Pat you should go to the tower in the red area to the north :)
[2:24:03] <oda_flobunaga> I get the feeling that the critical path is only 3 DemiGodds deep for some reason
[2:24:03] <%tetraes> ucan try and run past em
[2:24:04] <joodatious> @BallerSwagBro9k he clearly aint tho they explicitly call him the strongest of the demigods for a reason
[2:24:04] <zhenthrim213> @CH3F015 WHY
[2:24:05] <sendart> run away sir robin
[2:24:08] <Rbeatononefour> new plan: DO NOT

[2:24:20] <%PrimalDweeb> Too slow
[2:24:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rubberfistfight Pat jumped thru a portal and reached one of the endgame zones LUL
[2:24:24] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> there is an item on the right corner
[2:24:25] <%Brassnarwhal> this is how you got oleg
[2:24:27] <@Spydurman> LUL
[2:24:29] <knotsundownsyndrome> @oda_flobunaga nah you can no-demigod it
[2:24:30] <joodatious> for the vast majority of players he's set up for last of the sharbearers
[2:24:33] <peachy996> Does new plan involve not dying
[2:24:34] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt I think it's one item at the bottom of those ruins, but you can't access the zone, it's just a vista point
[2:24:35] <%Brassnarwhal> persevere orbo
[2:24:38] <knotsundownsyndrome> you can skip godrick

[2:25:13] <knotsundownsyndrome> that's what a coward would say
[2:25:17] <%discoinfierno> Best part of open world games is trying to cheese your way to items  you shouldn't have yet
[2:25:21] <Kain5707> Pat do you want to fight a boss that gives 94k?
[2:25:25] <%xcompleasedad> Are you rushing the end of the game now? LUL

[2:33:27] <joodatious> Also I never expected Blaidd to be the character he is
[2:33:34] <joodatious> was sure he was gonna be just a boss
[2:33:48] <joodatious> and not a genuinely nice npc buddy
[2:33:55] <%RealThiele> lava chariot dungeon can eat all the dicks
[2:34:17] <binku_muja_> I heard that the sorceress pat accidentally killed can be brought back by 'repenting.' Is there any truth to that?
[2:34:40] <@Spydurman> @binku_muja_ yes, Pat did so to fix the questline
[2:34:44] <joodatious> @binku_muja_ it was true yes
[2:35:04] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt wait how did you get D killed?
[2:35:04] <joodatious> why would she be mad at you?
[2:35:04] <binku_muja_> Ah, must've missed that bit. Thanks!
[2:35:08] <%cade_calrayn> maybe? I'm not sure
[2:35:09] <RubberFistFight> i missed that
[2:35:15] <RubberFistFight> Ohhhhhh

[2:35:24] <%Dakuu75> (OH this fucking "dog"island)
[2:35:26] <RubberFistFight> Ranni's not pissed at you about that
[2:35:32] <RubberFistFight> i've done that in my game and it's totally fine
[2:35:35] <@Spydurman> @binku_muja_ there's a consumable and NPC that lets you fix any angry NPC's you've aggro'd
[2:35:38] <%cade_calrayn> Turtle time
[2:35:44] <Nordguy> did you give him the dagger between the ribs, Pat?
[2:35:47] <%greasypete00> its turtles again
[2:35:52] <joodatious> are there questlines connected?
[2:35:52] <+stellarseeker> As long as you didn't swing at him yourself you're probably fine
[2:35:55] <%Brassnarwhal> time for dog
[2:35:55] <%RealThiele> has anyone else had their roundtable invaded yet?
[2:35:56] <RubberFistFight> Speaking of which though what part of Ranni's quest are you actually up to? Coz it's long and rather convoluted. @PatStaresAt
[2:35:58] <%Dakuu75> I say, let him suffer untill he asks, chat/
[2:35:59] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Wasn't D one of gurranq's boys?
[2:35:59] <joodatious> otherwise it shouldn't effect it

[2:58:34] <+GallowsDrop> you forget Oleg? :(
[2:58:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> I take solace in the fact that even if I get spoiled I'm just gonna be like "wtf" and then forget about it for 20 hours until I find it myself
[2:58:41] <+TheBitingIrish> Chat, where was hunched lady?
[2:58:46] <%maskofmichael> that's why I only watch streams of games I've either already played or will never play
[2:58:54] <meloshav> with this game you can do just about every boss before Margaret
[2:59:00] <radiorosewater> i take diazepam, i don't remember anything

[3:00:27] <%Valdorick> @kinkade_77 If you want to be a cool dragon... and use one of the most busted spells in the game.
[3:01:23] <Nordguy> Pat, you can't sacrifice your IRL maiden for quest progress, that's bad to do
[3:01:41] <joodatious> we finely get cool dragon stuff and dont have to look like shitty goat dragon things in DS3
[3:01:42] <%cade_calrayn> Elmo probably doing big screm
[3:01:45] <%RealThiele> sacrifice maiden for insurance money
[3:01:57] <kinkade_77> just beat margit last night afer like 2 hours

[3:03:08] <radiorosewater> *dear
[3:03:10] <+PkSilent01> Hey Pat how you doing. So I gave the Cleric guy at the roundtable, who gives me Faith Spells the Dark Pyro spells, did I fucked up like in DS3 with Irina or will he be ok
[3:03:31] <deviljhojho_> ah yes
[3:03:35] <deviljhojho_> the scythe stab
[3:03:36] <%Brassnarwhal> pat stealing peach's lunch almost as hard as elden ring took horizon's lunch
[3:03:37] <+anoldtoilet> that is a really good backstab
[3:03:44] <joodatious> i love that scythes have their own animations for crit attacks
[3:04:00] <radiorosewater> they fixed the scythe crits
[3:04:02] <luciluxlu0> just give scrolls to the turtle. he's cool
[3:04:07] <+hoenhime344> these weapons seem good
[3:04:08] <%greasypete00> I started giving the tomes to the turtle because I was worried the monk guy was gonna get mad at me
[3:04:10] <zhenthrim213> he is gone in my playthorgh right now
[3:04:15] <+PkSilent01> I just gave the rest of my dark spells to the pope turtle just to be save seeing how he was chill about
[3:04:15] <%Brassnarwhal> it's so much better thanjust jamming the whole scythe through them
[3:04:21] <+alphonseisbest> Remember in DS1 when you would just stick the WHOLE sythe throuth them lol
[3:04:23] <Rbeatononefour> this is my fave enemy EZ
[3:04:30] <Ner234> I'm glad they changed the riposte/backstab for scythes. The old ones barely made sense
[3:04:34] <+PkSilent01> So how many Lords did Pat killed other than Godfrey
[3:04:35] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> team kill
[3:04:39] <+NeonFishFace> wow i hate that thing
[3:04:41] <meloshav> this tank was designed for practicality, the giant head is for aerodynamics
[3:04:42] <sothatsprettybrutal> roundtable cleric guy is just gathering titles for his banned books list
[3:04:42] <lethallylactic> monkaS

[3:06:09] <meloshav> woolie got screwed over because they didn't have his hair, pat never has to worry about that
[3:06:11] <deviljhojho_> i feel like im spreading my stats too thin
[3:06:22] <marlowe86> I thought Pat said he was feeling burnt out of Elden Ring and was taking a break?
[3:06:24] <SupidaMan> haaaaaaa
[3:06:40] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[3:06:41] <reonome> LUL

[3:06:53] <radiorosewater> pod
[3:06:55] <%Dew217> LUL
[3:06:55] <%cade_calrayn> during which he spent the entire time talking about elden ring
[3:06:56] <Parapattern> The podcast where you talked about Elden Ring the whole time
[3:06:57] <%FacetiousAF> i'm thinking i'm back
[3:07:01] <Ghufufin> but what about the PODCAST?
[3:07:02] <%Dakuu75> Lol
[3:07:05] <+alphonseisbest> Good ted talk
[3:07:06] <%Dew217> Very based Pat Talk thanks
[3:07:09] <%justcallmebobplease> @sniffy77 Please, two hours collectively, easily - they revisited it!
[3:07:09] <%Brassnarwhal> back and orbier than ever
[3:07:11] <@MistyMntns> When he says take a break I mean he doesnt play it for 12 hours
[3:07:14] <@Spydurman> the podcast that was 80% about Elden Ring?
[3:07:18] <%Saadi90> I’m taking a break today and watching you.
[3:07:19] <%strakillias> He took one day's break and then started jonesing for Elden ring. He even decided to do this earlier he was hurting so bad
[3:07:20] <%cylish> Yay or nay, dlc torrent skins
[3:07:22] <+alphonseisbest> like me and ff14
[3:07:22] <%BlueLunecy> Crazy like a fox
[3:07:23] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Addictionsetting in
[3:07:23] <sothatsprettybrutal> Madness meter
[3:07:24] <SomeAsianDood> Wasn't the podcast titled we don't talk about elden ring for 4 hours?
[3:07:27] <%cade_calrayn> but you were crazy before Elden Ring
[3:07:30] <kinkade_77> are you having dreams about elden ring?
[3:07:30] <%cade_calrayn> so there's not that much risk
[3:07:31] <%RigmaroleHM> Have you been dreaming about Elden Ring?
[3:07:32] <pi_in_the_sci> Didn't you play Elden Ring for a few hours off-stream right before the podcaste?
[3:07:33] <%YakumoYomi> "Go" crazy? Implying you're not already crazy?
[3:07:33] <zhenthrim213> the madness buildup happens
[3:07:36] <Psyramics> just do the podcast while playing elden ring, put the footage up instead of your camera
[3:07:38] <@MistyMntns> Says the man who has Elden ring scheduled for the rest of the week
[3:07:44] <dan_g_v> it was for just about 5 hours
[3:07:45] <%maskofmichael> All Elden Ring and no break make Pat go something something
[3:07:49] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat took a break from Elden Ring to talk about Elden Ring for 5 hours
[3:07:51] <+Pachi3000> bro
[3:07:55] <%barrakuta371> Increase your focus stat to reduce the crazy build up
[3:07:58] <%Cozy90> bork
[3:07:58] <%YakumoYomi> Gief demands toy
[3:07:59] <dan_g_v> brah
[3:08:02] <joodatious> the next podcast will be 2 hours more
[3:08:03] <RubberFistFight> he seems cross at steve buscelmo
[3:08:04] <dan_g_v> huh
[3:08:05] <+alphonseisbest> bruh
[3:08:05] <Ner234> BORK
[3:08:06] <Parapattern> Just let him be a lil goober
[3:08:06] <%strakillias> B E H I N D    C O U C H
[3:08:09] <%nanaki_ff14> how many of us are playing while watching pat play lol
[3:08:14] <dan_g_v> don't know what it is. TOUCH IT!
[3:08:18] <%Brassnarwhal> i look forward to next week where we get 2 more hours of elden ring
[3:08:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYYEE
[3:08:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GET READY
[3:08:29] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> Do you have Frozen Lightning Spear and is it any good?
[3:08:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:08:35] <meloshav> does he have seal key?
[3:08:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @eyw
[3:08:43] <lethallylactic> LUL
[3:08:44] <%greasypete00> yes
[3:08:45] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> OOPS
[3:08:45] <%Brassnarwhal> @eye_of_the_red_giant what's that
[3:08:48] <kinkade_77> yes
[3:08:51] <%raggedwharfrat> Yeah, it's really good!
[3:08:51] <%greasypete00> it needs 41 faith
[3:08:51] <%sniffy77> HOW DO YOU FREEZE LIGHTNING
[3:08:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @eye_of_the_red_giant Thats waaaaaaay later
[3:08:53] <Giztech> yes but it is a ground attack
[3:08:53] <kinkade_77> its the best one
[3:08:54] <ergulor> yeah
[3:08:58] <%Cozy90> Pat what is your scrimblo factor at?
[3:08:59] <luciluxlu0> @eye_of_the_red_giant it's alright. not the best
[3:09:00] <ape_hawk> how do you freeze lightning
[3:09:00] <%raggedwharfrat> 34 Faith*
[3:09:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAY LATER
[3:09:03] <%bruuzer12> Yeyeye
[3:09:04] <%Dew217> I believe its located at your moms house
[3:09:05] <%BlueLunecy> I just found that funny enough
[3:09:07] <+vaderxyz1970> @sniffy77 very carefully
[3:09:12] <%epide> i see visions of dragons in pats future
[3:09:12] <%Valdorick> 34, 41 is something else
[3:09:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> Their Better be a Blazing Lightning spear
[3:09:19] <%Valdorick> Not that much later, honestly.
[3:09:24] <sothatsprettybrutal> you were the lightning in that freezing rain
[3:09:25] <%greasypete00> I guess I mixed it up with another incantation my bad
[3:09:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @cozy90 Honestly this game is way less scrimblo than previous games
[3:09:39] <sirrice77> actually the turtle with bells and no bells are different
[3:09:40] <%Brassnarwhal> i found the 70 int spell people have been talking about
[3:09:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> There's like 12
[3:09:42] <kinkade_77> lightnings spears are the reason faith builds will ALWAYS be cooler than int
[3:09:43] <meloshav> you only need 2 per boss
[3:09:46] <meloshav> for boss weapons
[3:09:46] <huskarl_zap> have you met the thunder boar zombie werecreature?
[3:09:46] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Check the academy town later, i think the dude from the roundtable that was looking for his squire is there
[3:09:47] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> How many big bosses are there?
[3:09:48] <TechnocoloredCat> you need 70 int for the moon magic xD
[3:09:51] <rosabellamelantha> Puzzle
[3:09:58] <%RigmaroleHM> Tie its legs together with your X-wing
[3:09:58] <rosabellamelantha> this one took me a minute
[3:09:58] <%Dakuu75> I
[3:09:59] <%strakillias> Is there finally one you have to jump on top of?
[3:09:59] <%ReugaLive> enjoy this puzzle
[3:09:59] <+tizziks> I don't rememberthe others having bells
[3:10:00] <theanora1> ring the bell?
[3:10:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @brassnarwhal And its NOT worth it
[3:10:08] <joodatious> @hraezlyrnoyaiba like almost 80 total
[3:10:10] <+Local16> oh yeah the frozen one is somewhere that got noped out of
[3:10:13] <RubberFistFight> Not all of them do, i found 2 that didn't
[3:10:18] <+TheBitingIrish> Wrong :)
[3:10:20] <%blaccbird914> not the one i found
[3:10:23] <plaguedoctor_vi> the ones that sit dosen´t have a bell
[3:10:29] <%Dakuu75> You need to be on the upper cliff to do this one
[3:10:29] <%nanaki_ff14> I just got a Somber Smithing Stone (8) wtf?!?!?
[3:10:31] <dan_g_v> kill all the headless?
[3:10:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @ballerswagbro9k rip
[3:10:35] <%justcallmebobplease> Yeah there's at least a couple bell-less ones in an area.
[3:10:36] <+tizziks> yeah didn't thinbk so
[3:10:39] <pi_in_the_sci> yes they do
[3:10:39] <%raggedwharfrat> I found an illusory rock earlier today.
[3:10:42] <meloshav> climb up the side and find the weak point
[3:10:47] <%Valdorick> That's a lie
[3:10:48] <TheSinner42> yeah they do
[3:10:48] <meloshav> use your sword for a guiding light
[3:10:48] <sothatsprettybrutal> pretty peak shadow of the colossus stuff these guys
[3:10:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @plaguedoctor_vi that is very not true
[3:10:53] <SupidaMan> does pat have the lantern?
[3:10:53] <@Ranryu692> the bell ones totally sit down, I did it once
[3:10:53] <%Brassnarwhal> incorrect
[3:10:54] <Sunstalker> What? Bell ones do sit down
[3:10:54] <RubberFistFight> there's 2 up in the Uld ruins that don't have bells.
[3:10:56] <%cade_calrayn> I genuinely don't remmeber how I got this one to sit down
[3:10:56] <+jacksawjack> @plaguedoctor_vi wrong
[3:10:58] <%Brassnarwhal> literally wrong
[3:11:01] <+TheBitingIrish> Probably gotta drop down onto it when it's near the cliffs?
[3:11:01] <dan_g_v> mukbang!
[3:11:03] <joodatious> im going
[3:11:04] <+TDotGoat> I'M GOING
[3:11:05] <+gruff_gridof> im leaving

[3:11:15] <Ner234> Ok bye
[3:11:16] <Sunstalker> Pat got fucking One Guyed
[3:11:18] <RubberFistFight> @plaguedoctor_vi yeah it's super not true. People just repeating wrong shit left and right in chat, as per usual.
[3:11:19] <%FacetiousAF> nice stream while it lasted
[3:11:19] <%cade_calrayn> @RubberFistFight I thought they both had bells  when I was there
[3:11:20] <%Valdorick> psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle
[3:11:24] <@Ranryu692> !raffle
[3:11:27] <%Saadi90> Bye! Good stream.
[3:11:30] <%OrangeMDT> I’m going everywhere
[3:11:34] <+RedMaskBandit> !raffle
[3:11:43] <@MistyMntns> Guys dont forget to eat and have water!
[3:11:49] <@MistyMntns> Hydrate or Diedrate
[3:11:50] <RubberFistFight> @cade_calrayn Nope. I remember thinking "hey that's weird they don't have bells", and they didn't have any undead headless dudes around them either
[3:11:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> What if when pat gets back everyone doesnt type in chat for 1 minute lol
[3:11:54] <RubberFistFight> just strutting around in fields
[3:12:22] <+RedMaskBandit> he's going to see the viewer count and then read the chat
[3:12:35] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Quick, chat, while pat is gone: Are there any fucked up super pyromancies like forbidden sun in ER so far? Because it seems like every other spell goes up an extra notch from previous
[3:12:37] <sirrice77> All i know is this one in liurnia lets me dupe remembrances while the other ones i found actually didnt and i wonder what they're for
[3:12:43] <plaguedoctor_vi> @plaguedoctor_vi in my experience in the game the ones that i was able to put down 1 did not have any bell, 2 had the white spots
[3:12:47] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @RedMaskBandit Thats what makes it funny lol
[3:13:30] <plaguedoctor_vi> @plaguedoctor_vi Before you guy throw stone at me try to talk a little
[3:13:33] <RubberFistFight> Hopefully pat doesn't make the same mistake he did in Sekiro where he took quest advice from someone who just showed up and refused to give details because "spoilers"
[3:13:51] <joodatious> holty shit the general radahn fight is so fucked
[3:14:00] <%Dew217> Ive been playing Elden Ring vicariously through Pat. My toast can barely toast bread, So i doubt that i'd be able to forge an Elden Ring
[3:14:08] <plaguedoctor_vi> @joodatious trying that right now
[3:14:16] <RubberFistFight> @joodatious it's a fucking fantastic concept, and it's hype as fuck at first but MAN is just mechanically busted.
[3:14:24] <This_side_up_153> did he fight the invader at the Table of lost grace?
[3:14:25] <joodatious> pat is either gonna kill him easily or be stuck on him for an hour
[3:14:29] <joodatious> I love it
[3:14:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @joodatious amazing concept, fucking godawful execution
[3:14:37] <joodatious> @This_side_up_153 yes
[3:14:42] <meloshav> up to rng
[3:14:48] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> cant believe i accidently spoiled frozen lightning spear
[3:14:52] <meloshav> that's the problem with it, if he targets summons
[3:14:53] <RubberFistFight> @Kevlar_Caviar yup. Needs serious rebalancing.
[3:15:00] <This_side_up_153> thank you
[3:15:17] <joodatious> @RubberFistFight i mean its like a close to final boss fight
[3:15:34] <RubberFistFight> the problem is the fight is geared around the summons - it's an ingame event - but the summons go down in so few hits and their AI is jank as fuck
[3:15:37] <plaguedoctor_vi> @joodatious i dont think it the bed of chaos case of this game, but for sure people are going to swallow their summon pride for that one
[3:15:40] <RubberFistFight> @joodatious what no it's not lol
[3:15:41] <joodatious> you just have to change how you fight since it clearly wants you to be on horse
[3:15:46] <meloshav> you can fight it as your first boss can't you?
[3:15:57] <meloshav> if you take the right path
[3:16:04] <joodatious> @RubberFistFight literally all his attacks are faster then running
[3:16:10] <sapphomet777> pattuh
[3:16:12] <%Kevlar_Caviar> the REAL bed of chaos of this game is the first boss of the tornado zone pat visited earlier
[3:16:22] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight no they're not.
[3:16:39] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RubberFistFight you can summon them again in the middle of the fight, in that meteor jump it probally for that
[3:16:53] <RubberFistFight> mounting up is only useful for doing something during the mid-fight phase change
[3:16:59] <joodatious> no spoiling the actual fight
[3:17:04] <RubberFistFight> if you mount during the actual fight, a single swing kills your mount and leaves you pinned
[3:17:04] <joodatious> so shush people
[3:17:08] <RubberFistFight> then he just leaps on you
[3:17:10] <joodatious> try to be vague at least
[3:17:27] <meloshav> Range makes him a joke tho
[3:17:31] <meloshav> just let npc tank
[3:17:32] <%Kevlar_Caviar> that boss doesn't even have a good concept like radahn, it's just all around awful
[3:17:33] <%bevyrage> if you time it right the horse mount puts you to invuln
[3:17:34] <plaguedoctor_vi> yes he right lets stop the moment pat get here
[3:17:37] <RubberFistFight> @plaguedoctor_vi yeah that's basically the only time i was mounted - that and the initial runup after getting Blaidd
[3:17:39] <%CopperTucker> CopperTucker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! Hi Pat, I hope you're all doing well. I just want to say thank you for all the entertainment over the years.
[3:18:19] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RubberFistFight i think mounted it not viable to that fight every hit of his dismount you
[3:18:22] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i think miyazaki intentionally puts at least one fucking abysmal boss in each game because he thinks it's funny
[3:18:33] <%mythcreant> bless him
[3:18:44] <%RealThiele> deathbird v2 is a bitch
[3:18:48] <RubberFistFight> @Kevlar_Caviar yeah, BoC was just "we ran out of time and threw this shit together". Radahn is a fantastic concept executed horribly.
[3:19:41] <RubberFistFight> Radahn also isn't an "endgame boss" like someone insisted because you get a quest to kill him super early.
[3:19:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @RubberFistFight the first boss of furam azula is also a "we ran out of time and threw this shit together boss"
[3:19:48] <+RedMaskBandit> Demon souls, DS2, DS3, BB and Sekiro didn't have any boss that even goes near the Bed of Chaos.
[3:19:56] <RubberFistFight> and said quest goes for AAAAAAGES after he's dead.
[3:20:09] <RubberFistFight> @Kevlar_Caviar wait, is that the goddamn fire giant i've been hearing about?
[3:20:21] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @RubberFistFight nope, after that
[3:20:26] <RubberFistFight> @RedMaskBandit DS2 had covetous demon, that was just lazy and pathetic
[3:20:47] <RubberFistFight> Sekiro had Demon of Hatred that was thematically great but the wrong kind of boss for the game.
[3:20:48] <joodatious> DS2 is just boring when it comes to bad boss fights
[3:20:56] <joodatious> it doesn't have the ability to even be interesting
[3:21:03] <femto216> It‘s so weird for me to tune live streams from Pat
[3:21:10] <+RedMaskBandit> its not even on the same spectrum of BoC
[3:21:11] <RubberFistFight> DS2 has plenty of great boss fights
[3:21:12] <joodatious> @RubberFistFight i mean literally just get good for that
[3:21:15] <%Kevlar_Caviar> here's the boss i'm referring to in rot13 to avoid spoilers (which we should really be doing btw): tbqfxva qhb
[3:21:19] <%quantras6> Enjoy your meal?

[3:21:57] <%Dew217> Zangief requires that you baby bird feed him by mouth
[3:22:01] <%Mister_McDerp> what a good boy
[3:22:06] <%Puhff> let him have your mouth
[3:22:14] <RubberFistFight> @joodatious or just ledge cheese him instead of spending hours on a boss with fullscreen grabs and absurd AOE attacks.
[3:22:14] <+alphonseisbest> 160p gang

[3:23:21] <Saltmeisterr> LUL
[3:23:25] <radiorosewater> i was gone awhile
[3:23:26] <+bluedude153> How the fuck would someone miss you having a dog, its impossible to avoid
[3:23:28] <plaguedoctor_vi> damn been under a rock have you?
[3:23:29] <%Puhff> dang guy
[3:23:29] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[3:23:32] <RubberFistFight> @alphonseisbest sure it does. Looking glass knight is cool. Veldstadt is fucking awesome.
[3:23:33] <%ElkRiverDog> This is a joke, right?
[3:23:39] <%cade_calrayn> just keep hitting the legs? Imaybe?
[3:23:45] <Kain5707> "a while" is putting it lightly LUL
[3:23:49] <%Dew217> Gief has been a staple member of family since back in the SF1 days
[3:23:51] <%Puhff> Yeah clearly lol
[3:23:54] <radiorosewater> @ElkRiverDog only if the dog isnt real
[3:23:56] <RubberFistFight> in fairness though i will admit most of DS2's base bosses are relatively mediocre-to-bad.
[3:23:58] <mickrickler> hit the legs the coral on it
[3:24:00] <%BinaryFireball> looook pretty empty
[3:24:03] <+alphonseisbest> @RubberFistFight ...Bruh no. <3 but just no
[3:24:07] <joodatious> @RubberFistFight Mirror knight is the most interesting but the other dude is just a neat piece of armor
[3:24:07] <%BinaryFireball> totally
[3:24:08] <notaplushtoy> to be fair, a lot has happened over the last two years...
[3:24:12] <joodatious> pretty boring tho over all
[3:24:15] <%Puhff> Gief the Eternal
[3:24:21] <+hakumaribo> i  think you have ot leap of faith it from up high
[3:24:27] <+alphonseisbest> ds2 is still good
[3:24:33] <+alphonseisbest> just has meh bosses imo
[3:24:35] <%alcors_wisdom> i think that coral is actually the glimmer shit because its on the glimmer dragons too
[3:24:35] <joodatious> literally just big dudes with swords and not much flavor to go with it
[3:24:35] <lethallylactic> Yeah sometimes the coral is on the building itself.
[3:24:41] <joodatious> DS2 is arguably bad
[3:24:44] <joodatious> and worth skipping
[3:24:45] <RubberFistFight> @alphonseisbest it's a decent game. it's just not a decent SOULS game.
[3:24:49] <%FacetiousAF> hall wug?
[3:24:52] <RubberFistFight> @joodatious no.
[3:24:57] <%BinaryFireball> dont worry about it
[3:25:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Did pat find the cave under the academy?
[3:25:02] <+alphonseisbest> @RubberFistFight yeh
[3:25:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> YEAH
[3:25:06] <Xelhesia> god?
[3:25:07] <%BinaryFireball> no just shhhh let the lightning do its thing
[3:25:08] <+alphonseisbest> @joodatious too harsh
[3:25:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> these plants do it
[3:25:11] <chowndawg> fulgurbloom
[3:25:14] <%BinaryFireball> dont worrrrrrry about it
[3:25:17] <radiorosewater> dark souls 2 ahead, therefore visions of kings field
[3:25:17] <lethallylactic> ⚡
[3:25:21] <chowndawg> the plants cause the lightning
[3:25:24] <+stellarseeker> Lightning is magnetized to those plants
[3:25:28] <%ElkRiverDog> glowing flowers?
[3:25:30] <binku_muja_> for a moment i thought the lightning was striking swords in the ground.
[3:25:30] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Did pat find the cave inside of his walls?
[3:25:36] <dan_g_v> time for fire
[3:25:37] <+alphonseisbest> DS2 is the BEST SOULS LIKE
[3:25:37] <%whyskeywolfe> If it's night time, you might want to try going just east of the Academy.
[3:25:37] <joodatious> its crazy how there
[3:25:42] <Happydisaster> The plants attract lightning
[3:25:43] <joodatious> is gravity magic
[3:25:47] <plaguedoctor_vi> you did not take the hug from the lady have you?
[3:25:48] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Has Pat found the power of friendship
[3:26:03] <joodatious> and the gravity magic is a HUGE DEAL
[3:26:04] <%Dew217> Thats a lot of spore bois under that bridger
[3:26:11] <RubberFistFight> @alphonseisbest that might be a bridge too far. The existence of ADP makes it a hard sell at the very least.
[3:26:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Who else perfers "SoulsBorne" over "Souls like"
[3:26:23] <%Kevlar_Caviar> fun fact: these enemies are called Land Squirts
[3:26:23] <%BinaryFireball> do the balls drop anything good ever?
[3:26:30] <%Kevlar_Caviar> which is what i call a very dry shart
[3:26:34] <+anoldtoilet> constantly
[3:26:36] <dan_g_v> amazing
[3:26:36] <binku_muja_> @plaguedoctor_vi if you mean the deathbed companion, then yes, he did at the first meeting. Then used it later to get back his health.
[3:26:41] <RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc soulsborne specifically refers to fromsoft games though
[3:26:46] <%Dew217> Did they release a Elden Ring artbook?
[3:26:51] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> @BinaryFireball Your voice
[3:26:51] <%Puhff> Lol git fukd
[3:26:52] <RubberFistFight> souls-like is for things emulating or aping the genre
[3:26:55] <+alphonseisbest> @RubberFistFight ye but can u name a better souls like? its still beats most of'em
[3:26:59] <Guardiansaiyan> see ya in VOD!
[3:27:01] <%BinaryFireball> under the academy i reckon
[3:27:01] <luciluxlu0> it's near the dragon
[3:27:04] <%twistedj3ster> sleepy slime
[3:27:04] <%JoshManVGH> The crystal cave?
[3:27:05] <+anoldtoilet> this one
[3:27:06] <%alcors_wisdom> think you need to actually enter the academy but maybe hes talking about another one
[3:27:07] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt West side of the Academy, west of where you fought the dragon
[3:27:10] <+anoldtoilet> elden ring is better than ds2
[3:27:11] <+anoldtoilet> >_>
[3:27:13] <tolloponik> why are you fighting fat Emil clones?
[3:27:16] <plaguedoctor_vi> @binku_muja_ so you can get you heath back if you use the iten hmm?
[3:27:17] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Dew217 you get a digital artbook with the digital edition but it literally has like 15 drawings in it lmao
[3:27:18] <joodatious> exactly DS2 isn't a real dark souls game ;)
[3:27:21] <%Puhff> Yeah it's under there :)
[3:27:24] <+alphonseisbest> @anoldtoilet well duh
[3:27:24] <%raggedwharfrat> The dragon is guarding it.
[3:27:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight I think of it like Meditrovania a genre name
[3:27:25] <%epide> direct left of the academy its called academy crystal cave
[3:27:26] <Tina_Skellybutt> north west side near the crab claw rock
[3:27:26] <%BinaryFireball> @hraezlyrnoyaiba i walked into that one
[3:27:31] <+TheBitingIrish> Chat, how do I get onto the plateau above the Albinauric village?
[3:27:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Circle the base of the academy until you find a fog wall
[3:27:35] <+alphonseisbest> @joodatious this guy gets it LUL
[3:27:37] <Sunstalker> It doesn't connect to the academy but there's a tower to go up past it's boss
[3:27:43] <%epide> it should have 3 bettals near it
[3:27:43] <%JoshManVGH> Seems like all the little orange and black blots on the map are dungeons
[3:27:48] <%epide> beatles
[3:27:49] <%Dew217> @Kevlar_Caviar Oh thats sad I was thinking of getting it
[3:27:49] <binku_muja_> @plaguedoctor_vi using the item will undo the restriction as far as I know.
[3:27:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> Touch Grass
[3:27:50] <RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc well soulslike would be the genre, wouldn't it
[3:28:01] <plaguedoctor_vi> @binku_muja_ thanks
[3:28:07] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I know this is dating myself, but whenever pat says grace I think of the show Grace Under Fire
[3:28:18] <binku_muja_> No problem! happy to help!
[3:28:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight yes and I prefer refering to the genre as SoulsBorne
[3:28:26] <+tizziks> the revine is where that lady said the ruins to  the plateu is yeah?
[3:28:33] <+RedMaskBandit> Soulslike is a literal tag in Steam.
[3:28:40] <%whyskeywolfe> Oh yeah, keep going straight ahead to the end of the ravine
[3:28:52] <%gitgouda> love the cuckoo knight helmet
[3:29:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> man I AM SO FAR BEHIND
[3:29:01] <RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc i mean, you're free to do that, but basically everyone else takes "soulsborne" to mean the 4 souls games, bloodborne, sekiro and now this.
[3:29:11] <binku_muja_> The dude looks like an rpg protag that just threw random shit on for the final boss.
[3:29:12] <+alphonseisbest> H e had a dope sword tho
[3:29:20] <%BinaryFireball> so are there any benefits to dual wielding in ER?
[3:29:26] <%whyskeywolfe> Just run along the riverbed.
[3:29:37] <Saltmeisterr> @BinaryFireball its KEWL
[3:29:40] <+theballad_tft> you broke their cart, and asked if they were cool
[3:29:46] <joodatious> @BinaryFireball dual wielding attacks
[3:29:47] <+alphonseisbest> @BinaryFireball faster status build up
[3:29:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BinaryFireball More strenght and access to weapon arts
[3:29:53] <+RedMaskBandit> @binaryfireball there's an extra moveset.
[3:29:55] <+Alsatorec> hey pat im on a scythe quest do you remember where you found the scythe in your left hand?
[3:30:01] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt to get to the cave under the academy just run around in the water area around the actual academy building and you'll find it
[3:30:02] <%BinaryFireball> ahhhh ty
[3:30:14] <+alphonseisbest> who?
[3:30:15] <zevenmillion> so what important thigns have happened since he got the gold skull armor?
[3:30:20] <+alphonseisbest> YOOO
[3:30:24] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Eyes on the inside lady
[3:30:26] <+alphonseisbest> eyeball eater
[3:30:38] <%Cozy90> Woolie was right. THERE WERE GRAPES
[3:30:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O artisanal grapes
[3:30:41] <%JoshManVGH> What is it with this lady and her fucking grapes!
[3:30:43] <Parapattern> You mean blisters?
[3:30:45] <ohno58> What accent is that?
[3:30:45] <%sniffy77> Goddamn lady u and ur fucking grapes
[3:30:45] <femto216> Kill her!
[3:30:46] <peachy996> I got some grapes that people have left their fingerprints on
[3:30:47] <+RedMaskBandit> @zevenmillion he got better armor that he's not wearing.
[3:30:48] <+alphonseisbest> THEY WERE EYES LADY
[3:30:48] <peachy996> OH!
[3:30:51] <binku_muja_> ??? woman, stop eating gross as hell eyeballs and calling them grapes!
[3:30:52] <+tizziks> she got over eating eyes quick, now she is asking for special eyes
[3:30:55] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Her addiction is getting worse
[3:30:55] <joodatious> I've been rocking Dual Partisans and its great
[3:30:59] <+TheMeromex> drugs
[3:31:00] <Ner234> She's need the GOOD stuff now
[3:31:06] <joodatious> the partisans fuck hard
[3:31:07] <LtBoiii> miyazaki really has a thing for fingers
[3:31:08] <chowndawg> lady has issues
[3:31:08] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> it's in the frenzied village north east of you
[3:31:08] <%Toast_Master_General> This bitch just wants to eat people
[3:31:10] <ohno58> EYES ON THE INSIDE
[3:31:15] <%Puhff> MAD YOU SAY
[3:31:17] <%Kevlar_Caviar> didn't you get one right after the godrick fight?
[3:31:21] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Next she will be asking for whole babies
[3:31:22] <%Valdorick> I mean, she's just a fire keeper
[3:31:22] <plaguedoctor_vi> did pat tell her the true?
[3:31:23] <ape_hawk> do you think if she eats a stoner's eyes, she'll get the eye munchies even worse?
[3:31:24] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt one is dropped by a specific NPC invader
[3:31:24] <+alphonseisbest> I'VE got some grapes she can chew on heh Kappa
[3:31:25] <digaogrunge> Nedds her eyeball fix
[3:31:27] <%Kevlar_Caviar> or did you use it for something else
[3:31:30] <plaguedoctor_vi> her*
[3:31:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I cna't find golden seeds I got like a +5 tear of 3 charges
[3:31:40] <%Valdorick> Just shove the eyeballs inside you and bam - you see the light at the end of the dark
[3:31:53] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt everything north of the Erdtree (those cliffs you were trying to get up after Black Knife Catacombs) is accessible to you now if you follow the road north from this church
[3:31:57] <RubberFistFight> WE NEED MORE EYES ON THE INSIDE
[3:32:05] <binku_muja_> @alphonseisbest are you sure you want to risk that? She would literally eat them.
[3:32:12] <+alphonseisbest> \o-
[3:32:15] <joodatious> changing the spell to be basically just summon swords is the greatest thing ever
[3:32:18] <%Puhff> @doc look for gold sapling trees
[3:32:29] <joodatious> the swords STAY ON YOU EVEN WHEN RESTING
[3:32:33] <joodatious> its incredible
[3:32:35] <+alphonseisbest> @binku_muja_ nothing ventured nothing gained LUL
[3:32:49] <%Mister_McDerp> finger fetish
[3:33:02] <joodatious> the lore grandmas
[3:33:11] <binku_muja_> how is she carting her seat around?
[3:33:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> She STRONGLY reminds me of the old lady in Jojo Part 3
[3:33:26] <%whyskeywolfe> It's a sickass passage
[3:33:33] <%alcors_wisdom> sounds like youre locked into the scrunko ending now
[3:33:38] <+alphonseisbest> GOD THIS GAME IS SOOO COOL
[3:33:39] <binku_muja_> how the f-ck is it cowardly to find another way to your destination?
[3:33:41] <joodatious> @BallerSwagBro9k its basically the same name lol
[3:33:41] <Parapattern> Are you ready for the pussy no balls passage?
[3:33:41] <%Mister_McDerp> always be a coward
[3:33:44] <DestroPrime83> Pat gonna take the cowards way out?
[3:33:58] <ziggy_1031> @PatStaresAt didn't some guy give you like, a map or something with an X on it?
[3:34:01] <rosabellamelantha> I didn;t even know the cowards passage existed until I has already gone through Caelid to get the other half
[3:34:03] <%Mister_McDerp> never don't be a coward
[3:34:12] <binku_muja_> I think the question is, which route give you the most sickass loot?
[3:34:12] <garbageheaphound> how many shards the ring does pat have so far?
[3:34:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This game doesn't lock you out of endings until very close to the end of the game
[3:34:20] <rosabellamelantha> 1
[3:34:20] <HotSauceFiend> I'm playing Yakuza 7 mahjng in the background and im furious. srry needed to vent somewhere. also this looks pretty
[3:34:32] <+alphonseisbest> @garbageheaphound 1 i think
[3:34:40] <RubberFistFight> is that the final form of Doctor Bong from Sekiro?
[3:34:49] <tolloponik> look at Dracula's castle in the distance
[3:34:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Lol Lmao
[3:34:55] <rosabellamelantha> It doesn't lock you out of endings but I don't think you can do Ranni and Fia at the same time
[3:35:02] <joodatious> man this is gonna be ALOT of streams
[3:35:05] <rosabellamelantha> friend tried and ranni refused to help them
[3:35:05] <%GabeSweetMan> GabeSweetMan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months, currently on a 38 month streak! What Game Journos Said: "Miyazaki-san, please give us an easier difficulty option." What Miyazaki heard: "Please give us an [ABUNDANCE OF SWAMP LEVELS]!"
[3:35:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rosabellamelantha u can
[3:35:13] <joodatious> pats only on the SECOND area btw
[3:35:17] <meloshav> did pat get to the belfries?
[3:35:19] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha I'm on both of their quests and neither of them have excluded the other yet, so idk if that's true
[3:35:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @destroprime83 gotta do Ranni 1st
[3:35:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> oops
[3:35:36] <spinningchurro> pat are the concerns of the game overwhelming players overblown?
[3:35:41] <%za7az> Enemies seem to hit really hard in Elden Ring compared to the other games
[3:35:47] <rosabellamelantha> Ah ok so it's fine as long as you do Ranni first
[3:35:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rosabellamelantha gotta do Ranni 1st
[3:35:48] <+GallowsDrop> so did you forgo the who Strength Faith things to get the scythe powerstancing?
[3:36:01] <joodatious> overwhelming but in a good way
[3:36:05] <%RigmaroleHM> I don't consider that a bad thing
[3:36:11] <+alphonseisbest> nah skyrim has to still be bigger
[3:36:11] <ape_hawk> even bigger than fallout 76?!?!?!?
[3:36:12] <%BinaryFireball> the overwhelming becomes less whelming when you start to learn what each thing on the map is
[3:36:17] <%whyskeywolfe> It's bigness is enhanced by it's density.
[3:36:18] <%crimsonharvest> crimsonharvest subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[3:36:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rosabellamelantha also dont kill Raya Lucaria final boss until Ranni says u can
[3:36:20] <RubberFistFight> @za7az the enemy scaling is very weird. There are dudes you have to fight like hell to down right next to goofs that go over in a single hit.
[3:36:20] <%FacetiousAF> good hours per dollar ratio here
[3:36:21] <%GabeSweetMan> The same could be said of BotW.
[3:36:22] <+NeonFishFace> that's how it is
[3:36:26] <penitentpendant> Artillery Says Nah
[3:36:26] <%furiousfurioso> I can easily envision some people being overwhelmed
[3:36:26] <+anoldtoilet> @GallowsDrop theyre strength faith scythes apparently
[3:36:30] <@Spydurman> LUL
[3:36:32] <%Mister_McDerp> trebuchets PogChamp
[3:36:33] <joodatious> Its the quality of a full fledged souls game but massive.
[3:36:34] <%whyskeywolfe> [STEALTH TREBUCHET]
[3:36:36] <HotSauceFiend> but are the enemies really mechanically different from the Dark souls experience?
[3:36:36] <femto216> Asmongold quit the game because of it
[3:36:39] <binku_muja_> that should be tracking you that closely.
[3:36:40] <%crimsonharvest> oh man is that one of those pussy giant skinny archermans i love dunking on them
[3:36:41] <rosabellamelantha> Someone should tell pat that
[3:36:43] <%BinaryFireball> very bucket
[3:36:49] <%jamsbybetty> get treb'd scrub
[3:36:50] <peachy996> That's how it is
[3:36:51] <%Puhff> Yeah it's rough cuz I struggle with FOBO
[3:36:59] <joodatious> @GabeSweetMan honestly this blows BOTW out of the water easily. unlike that game this has real dungeons and a story that makes sense
[3:37:01] <meloshav> I did ranni storyline after killing final lucario boss
[3:37:04] <+healnavi> Is it bigger than an MMO?
[3:37:04] <%BinaryFireball> i love the flame head tanks
[3:37:08] <%BinaryFireball> so cool
[3:37:10] <tolloponik> oh its the chimney things!!
[3:37:21] <digaogrunge> CHEST
[3:37:23] <%BinaryFireball> great mace btw is awesome strength weapon
[3:37:24] <joodatious> @healnavi no lol
[3:37:27] <+anoldtoilet> wow, thats a great mace wtfLUL
[3:37:31] <rosabellamelantha> the not killing rennala I mean
[3:37:31] <%crimsonharvest> worth it tbh strike weapons cause turgidity
[3:37:31] <peachy996> @joodatious Does this game have a story that makes sense? I don't think so
[3:37:32] <%Mister_McDerp> pretty great
[3:37:42] <binku_muja_> that's one of the few downsides; fighting mobs is rarely ever worth it which disincentivizes clearing them out.
[3:37:47] <joodatious> @peachy996 it does
[3:37:48] <%BinaryFireball> make it heavy gets B scaling then goes to A
[3:37:49] <HotSauceFiend> are you playing on the console version? I am holding off buying this on PC because people told me stuttering was an issue. Is that still true?
[3:37:51] <plainsongz> hammer PogChamp
[3:37:51] <%barkon345> @GabeSweetMan yea but breath of the wild had a tone of empty space with nothing really going on in it. not only is this game big but it also filled to the brim with things to explore and discover
[3:37:51] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[3:37:53] <leaplearning> @joodatious what story? get the mulligan of power?
[3:37:57] <%OrangeMDT> Oh no… those souls tho :O
[3:38:00] <+tempestzephyr> vort stick
[3:38:02] <%GabeSweetMan> @GabeSweetMan They are very different games. I was simply referring to the expansiveness of the maps themselves.
[3:38:11] <joodatious> its actually fairly simple to follow if you pay attention
[3:38:20] <+anoldtoilet> @leaplearning theres a lot more small personal stories in this w npcs it seems like
[3:38:24] <%cade_calrayn> Yup!
[3:38:50] <HotSauceFiend> Oh, A good question. Do you feel the influence of George Martin in this game at all
[3:38:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Grand Lift of Dee
[3:39:19] <+Grayhammatter> dectus deez nuts
[3:39:19] <%bruuzer12> I'm out of the loop, did Pat kill Wolfman for his head?
[3:39:20] <+anoldtoilet> theres incest and people eating poop so yes
[3:39:22] <%whyskeywolfe> Probably.
[3:39:22] <+anoldtoilet> grrm ftw
[3:39:28] <joodatious> @HotSauceFiend the most obvious one is probably the more focus on actual factions
[3:39:28] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yes
[3:39:29] <spinningchurro> I wonder how the DLC for this game will look, if any.
[3:39:30] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I actually reccomend just doing the normal route as the upper area is NO JOKE
[3:39:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @hotsaucefiend Many locations names and lore has big GRRM vibes
[3:39:33] <+alphonseisbest> @HotSauceFiend more then u think, less then u hope i'd put it
[3:39:38] <tolloponik> is this were patches sent you?
[3:39:40] <%cade_calrayn> you can try the "coward's path" though, Pat
[3:39:40] <$vehementvadr> you have half of the item you need pat
[3:39:40] <%epide> back the switch is the spot in front of statue
[3:39:42] <+GallowsDrop> you have to go tho that shithole eventually
[3:39:44] <%cade_calrayn> which is the normal route
[3:39:47] <penitentpendant> Time to open the Mines of Moria?
[3:39:47] <%BinaryFireball> honestly going right round right round is good content
[3:39:53] <%Valdorick> Oh hey Pay, want a hint on where to find the Eyeball for the Lady?
[3:39:55] <rosabellamelantha> Caelid is the normal rout
[3:39:56] <+RedMaskBandit> there's a sword that's just the iron throne
[3:40:02] <%cade_calrayn> this game says be a coward
[3:40:09] <%Valdorick> Go right at the Lift
[3:40:11] <%furiousfurioso> I made a few pokes into caelid earlier, got some wild gear but boy that place is a nightmare
[3:40:13] <+Grayhammatter> the shabiri grape
[3:40:19] <%BinaryFireball> has pat heard any singing yet?
[3:40:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT HEADING TO MIYAZAKIS CASTLE
[3:40:23] <RubberFistFight> If you want to get a fingerprint grape you're looking for the Church of Inhibition
[3:40:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:40:29] <%cade_calrayn> East from the lift, that is
[3:40:36] <%cade_calrayn> right while *facing* the lift
[3:40:47] <leaplearning> @anoldtoilet not really, there are far more interesting character stores in BOTW than elden ring. BOTW had mutliple ways to uncover the entire story, from taking pictures to talking to NPCs. While there ios many more places in Elden Ring than BOTW, there is far more life in BOTW than Elden Ring.
[3:40:51] <%BinaryFireball> yesssss
[3:40:51] <%bruuzer12> Hey Pat, did you kill Blaidd for that helmet?
[3:40:58] <x2Twistedx> i hated this part
[3:41:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Keep going North
[3:41:04] <joodatious> Caelid somehow feels more dire then anything in dark souls
[3:41:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> oh sadge
[3:41:19] <binku_muja_> botw has sod all in terms of story and characters. not sure where you are getting that from.
[3:41:24] <%bruuzer12> Oh sick!
[3:41:24] <%BinaryFireball> caelid is just a place where you dont get off your horse
[3:41:27] <RubberFistFight> @leaplearning having played both games, i can't help but disagree.
[3:41:29] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Hell yeah touch that grace hole
[3:41:30] <%Valdorick> @bruuzer12 He didn't, he stole it from a Cosplayer's Corpse
[3:41:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> If u guys think Caelid is bad...... Kappa
[3:41:36] <penitentpendant> It's a high level zone next to the starting zone. So everything there will splat you when you first visit.
[3:41:47] <artoflec> yeah i dont remember any character stories in BOTW personally
[3:41:49] <ArgentUndaCova> They called it a mine, a mine mopD
[3:41:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> different mine Pat
[3:41:50] <%bruuzer12> @valdorick Ah, that's pretty cool
[3:41:55] <%nanaki_ff14> Iv been in Calid for 2 days I have learned to love it like stockholm syndrome
[3:41:58] <%tyler274> Caelid is the git gud zone
[3:41:59] <%cade_calrayn> *one* of the mines, that is
[3:42:06] <%bruuzer12> There are many mines
[3:42:06] <joodatious> Caelid is like a threat of what the stakes are for the world
[3:42:09] <radiorosewater> welcome to 2-1
[3:42:10] <+alphonseisbest> @binku_muja_  dude what? its has cites FULL of npcs and character stories that link interacts with
[3:42:15] <penitentpendant> Gnome Mine
[3:42:22] <meloshav> oh boy he's going through here
[3:42:22] <peachy996> the Your
[3:42:23] <@Fuggins4U> Pat finally found the kryptonite
[3:42:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i love these small men
[3:42:26] <meloshav> this gonna be good
[3:42:28] <tri3dgE027> The Woolie Hole LuL
[3:42:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Par family noooooooo
[3:42:33] <+alphonseisbest> @artoflec FISH MAN, the four heros there are quite a few
[3:42:34] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i have no idea what the fuck they are but i love them
[3:42:35] <%nanaki_ff14> Just beat General Radahn before I explored any of it now im going around discoving things
[3:42:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MIYAZAKI HOLE
[3:42:42] <meloshav> get trapped
[3:42:49] <Frranky> pat's in a mine killing kobolds
[3:42:53] <+pectusumbra> so the pryo looking stuff is faith now, got it
[3:42:59] <%bruuzer12> Poison Mine!
[3:43:05] <ape_hawk> pat, lantern
[3:43:06] <sothatsprettybrutal> that was a nice hint from that finger-reading lady: normally pat needs to make a doctor's appointment to explore the coward's passage
[3:43:07] <binku_muja_> @alphonseisbest full of npcs that do nothing, offer nothing and have no stories beyond "hey go fetch x." You are conflating the game.
[3:43:12] <artoflec> @alphonseisbest oh sure yeah, i mean, to be clear i dont think im going to remember even the names of npcs in this game LUL
[3:43:13] <leaplearning> @RubberFistFight you know far more about BOTW's world than Elden Ring's world. Elden Ring is largely told in previous entries and barley surviving cultures while BOTW had you interact with past and present cultures.
[3:43:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> CLOSE
[3:43:19] <joodatious> @binku_muja_ boring npcs and has far less stories and npcs then any other big zelda game
[3:43:22] <heartlesshealer> all mines are technically poisonous
[3:43:28] <razz_zie> @PatStaresAt Did u kill another big boss like Godrick? So I watch back on the vod :3
[3:43:29] <radiorosewater> OH
[3:43:34] <$vehementvadr> except ice
[3:43:36] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I think there are a fair chunk of ice spells that are int
[3:43:37] <+alphonseisbest> @artoflec lol fair enough
[3:43:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> elements are strong
[3:43:42] <+theoldone001> Bro I'd give both my nuts for some Smith Stones (1) I cant find ANY
[3:43:44] <%GabeSweetMan> @binku_muja_ If I may ask, how many zelda games have you played??
[3:43:48] <%bruuzer12> Except ice and magic, usually
[3:43:50] <+OrphixPride> how far is pat before i accidently get spoiled LUL
[3:43:58] <%za7az> @theoldone001 Same
[3:44:00] <ape_hawk> pat means hes gonna go double ultra greatsword again
[3:44:01] <%BinaryFireball> lots of weapons are str/dex/faith
[3:44:02] <%JoshManVGH> I'm 30 hours in and I JUST learned that you can attack from either side of Torrent...
[3:44:08] <sirrice77> Okay but don't respec to use colossal weapons like i did, they're not good
[3:44:08] <joodatious> @leaplearning yeah you know far more about a way less interesting world so there's that lol
[3:44:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @theoldone001 Yeah....Same
[3:44:09] <Happydisaster> It makes perfect sense
[3:44:09] <%cade_calrayn> Those are probably in a different zone
[3:44:11] <sothatsprettybrutal> the holy scythe
[3:44:15] <%za7az> @OrphixPride About to fight the final boss Kappa
[3:44:16] <lockoo404> what about those faith claws you found?
[3:44:17] <binku_muja_> @joodatious are you referring to botw or zelda games in general. because botw is the one lacking content story and character development wise.
[3:44:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Dh
[3:44:32] <%Kevlar_Caviar> or just use jumping attacks
[3:44:33] <joodatious> BOTW is literally just "its gannon again" the story
[3:44:34] <%Kevlar_Caviar> or both
[3:44:35] <%JoshManVGH> You can make any weapon Faith if you want to, can't you?
[3:44:37] <arkv01> bbbabby will be babby
[3:44:38] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Don't worry this game is very skewed for faith weapons
[3:44:40] <x2Twistedx> beware the ground
[3:44:41] <%AnthroMetal> I just found out they explode
[3:44:43] <%OrangeMDT> Think the game frontloads faith weapons??
[3:44:46] <%cade_calrayn> Considering faith = worship of the Erdtree, I bet there are Faith weapons in the Capital
[3:44:50] <+alphonseisbest> @binku_muja_ compared to ER thats the same thing THIS game just has more flair with it. also ur forgetting about the four heros and impa's story
[3:44:52] <penitentpendant> Unique Faith Weapon?
[3:44:53] <%JoshManVGH> Aaah
[3:44:54] <+pectusumbra> Man I would actually play this if my PC could handle it
[3:44:55] <%Dew217> Hey Pat as somebody whose struggled with Soulsbournes games Would elden ring be an "easier" entry
[3:44:56] <sleepystardewfarmer> they hate magic
[3:44:58] <+twdlrr> wasnt there a unique faith halberd that you picked up?
[3:45:01] <razz_zie> @PatStaresAt Did u kill another big boss like Godrick? So I can watch fight on the vods
[3:45:08] <joodatious> and sadly its also the worst gannon and the worst bosses and the worst story its been in a Zelda game
[3:45:09] <penitentpendant> Many status effects
[3:45:10] <Frranky> check those corners
[3:45:11] <%furiousfurioso> this lake is like the sorcery place right?
[3:45:11] <@QueequegTheater> GOTEEM
[3:45:22] <Sunstalker> If you want faith, there's two types of gargoyle halbers that both do holy dmg
[3:45:22] <joodatious> @furiousfurioso yesp
[3:45:23] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Most of the unique weapons are faith based
[3:45:26] <%Valdorick> Most lightning based stuff is also in the second half of the game
[3:45:27] <penitentpendant> Praise the esuna!
[3:45:31] <%BinaryFireball> godrick's fucking scream still haunts me
[3:45:35] <razz_zie> That's insane, so much shit to do lol
[3:45:39] <joodatious> though there are a few other big magic areas
[3:45:41] <VirtuaRailith> I feel like the game loves faith more than arcane
[3:45:42] <@Fuggins4U> kiss da babby
[3:45:46] <tolloponik> magic really has to blow me away to make picking it as my starting class worth it cause I'm starting to get builders remorse for how much faith is getting
[3:45:49] <spinningchurro> i wonder if BotW2 will have time to learn from this game.
[3:45:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @BinaryFireball his va is so good man
[3:45:51] <plaguedoctor_vi> yes i got a special int weapon and they are a little better
[3:46:03] <%Valdorick> I keep finding Int based swords. The one Faith sword I found was a 25 req faith *and* Int.
[3:46:04] <%BinaryFireball> @Kevlar_Caviar  they arrrre
[3:46:05] <%SaiyanShoto> That or he smells food hidden somewhere
[3:46:17] <tanarath> Emotional support pig needs emotional support too.
[3:46:18] <leaplearning> @joodatious there is not much interesting events of Elden Ring, it is just one dying or dead culture after the next. In BOTW you had different cultures, in Elden Ring, you really only have one, a slowly dying one.
[3:46:19] <Grave_Titan_D> these guys are kinda dicks
[3:46:25] <penitentpendant> Explosive Poo
[3:46:26] <+alphonseisbest> lol neat
[3:46:29] <%Kevlar_Caviar> honestly all of the voice acting in this game is great, except for like, one boss
[3:46:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Welcome
[3:46:30] <joodatious> I have a moonviel katana and its amazing
[3:46:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YIP
[3:46:34] <%whyskeywolfe> ye
[3:46:35] <%cade_calrayn> YUP
[3:46:37] <penitentpendant> You've beaten the Pre-Dungeon
[3:46:38] <KR_Black> What ? no faith weapons in the mage city ?? absurd
[3:46:39] <%Kevlar_Caviar> WAIT WHAT
[3:46:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GET READY
[3:46:43] <%za7az> I love this game lol
[3:46:43] <@QueequegTheater> WELCOME TO FUCK
[3:46:43] <%Kevlar_Caviar> THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO GET HERE
[3:46:44] <%Valdorick> Now the real game begins
[3:46:47] <%cade_calrayn> hope you like CLIMBING
[3:46:47] <+OrphixPride> Oh god this place is NotLIkeTHis
[3:46:47] <peachy996> Gameplay and world wise this beats BOTW clean but story? Nah man.
[3:46:52] <joodatious> @leaplearning but thats factually untrue?
[3:46:52] <%Kevlar_Caviar> I WENT THROUGH THE SHITTY PATH WHAT THE FUCK
[3:46:53] <%bruuzer12> YEYEYEYEY
[3:46:55] <x2Twistedx> dis place sucks
[3:46:56] <%BinaryFireball> this is the fun way to get on up
[3:46:57] <%Dew217> Thats some soft cotton. Would it make a good pillow?
[3:47:15] <%GabeSweetMan> @leaplearning We still need more time to absord the lore to know precisely how many cultures were around here but I highly doubt there was only one.
[3:47:18] <bleugh> i really should play ds3 before trying to play this any further i think
[3:47:19] <+theoldone001> Where is this? Raya Lucaria?
[3:47:20] <%GabeSweetMan> *absorb
[3:47:22] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Is powerstancing still just 2handing the left weapon
[3:47:22] <%bruuzer12> The real Elden Ring starts here
[3:47:33] <%BinaryFireball> this is the way up
[3:47:37] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> oh wow, woolie wasn't kidding when he said that lost graces were just bonfires
[3:47:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nope
[3:47:38] <%whyskeywolfe> This is the way forward
[3:47:41] <spinningchurro> it doesn’t seem like 3 years was enough to put this game together, there for sure are a lot of concepts here that they’ve been toying with a while or were unused from previous projects.
[3:47:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its up
[3:47:42] <joodatious> you can get to the next major area with this dungeon i think
[3:47:43] <%IvanMistwalker> Premature Donguen
[3:47:44] <penitentpendant> Workin' your way up
[3:47:44] <%cade_calrayn> It's the way to the Plateau
[3:47:45] <rosabellamelantha> this is the way forward
[3:47:46] <the_baghdaddy> Did pat miss an item back where that dude threw a smoke bomb at him?
[3:47:46] <%zarkazeon> th8s will go to atlus
[3:47:49] <%Nobrev> yo I hate this place. I gave up to go faff around on the other end of the map after spending a few hours here
[3:47:50] <binku_muja_> @alphonseisbest I've honestly lost track. botw was the last one I played, others I played years ago. haven't felt the need to play the more recent chibified versions or that warriors attempt.
[3:47:52] <rosabellamelantha> you can skip caelid entirely this way
[3:47:54] <%cade_calrayn> You have to climb the cliff to reach the plateau
[3:48:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Gotta climb that plateau
[3:48:09] <leaplearning> @joodatious No it's not, the main issue with the souls series is that it is based around barely alive cultures, there is no town where you can interact with the inhabitants in the same way you can with BOTW.
[3:48:10] <%bruuzer12> @queequegtheater you just need to dual wield weapons of the same type now
[3:48:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ...oh god
[3:48:20] <+Leftovermemes> you skipped a ladder
[3:48:22] <%Kevlar_Caviar> looking forward to that stream
[3:48:22] <@QueequegTheater> @bruuzer12 aww darn
[3:48:23] <joodatious> @rosabellamelantha pretty sure Caelid is mandatory
[3:48:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> U can't skip Caelid u need the rune there
[3:48:26] <%GabeSweetMan> Honestly I think it's waaaay to early to compared BotW and Elden Ring. We need time to digest this first to start drawing all of the potential parallels.
[3:48:28] <%Valdorick> Pat is doing Ranni's quest, he CAN NOT skip Caelid
[3:48:29] <%ReugaLive> yeah, you say that now
[3:48:29] <wolverinewaswrong> I love this dungeon
[3:48:30] <%whyskeywolfe> There are two ways into Castle Big Time. This is one of them, Caelid is the other.
[3:48:32] <+Leftovermemes> right before this one
[3:48:35] <binku_muja_> who's singing?
[3:48:36] <%bruuzer12> No extra stats or 2handing required
[3:48:38] <tanarath> :)
[3:48:44] <+Leftovermemes> to your right
[3:48:47] <+chimaera24> @leaplearning just because a game is going for a different feel with its world doesn't make it worse
[3:48:47] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> heal
[3:48:47] <+theoldone001> CAELID fucking sucks balls. In a good way as in shit's fucked and enemies are tough.
[3:48:50] <joodatious> @leaplearning but they're not the same kinds of worlds thats a dumb comparison.
[3:48:52] <DestroPrime83> I hear Pope shit
[3:48:55] <+alphonseisbest> wait where are u on the map pat?
[3:48:56] <penitentpendant> The benefits of unlocking checkpoints
[3:48:57] <peachy996> Story in this seems like the same ol' FromSoft Formula with GRRM helping write...something?
[3:48:58] <sirrice77> @tolloponik Magic gets stuff too but alot of magic stuff is in the academy, tied in to sellens questline, in selia in caelid, and probably more
[3:49:00] <+Grayhammatter> caelid is such a bitch
[3:49:02] <binku_muja_> is it the harpy?
[3:49:06] <@Ranryu692> the biggest difference between Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild is that Elden Ring actually has stuff to do in it
[3:49:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @binku_muja_ Something bad
[3:49:07] <%Dew217> Wow they added the mystical pokemon Lucario in Elden Ring truly a 10/10
[3:49:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yes
[3:49:11] <wolverinewaswrong> Raya Lucaria proves elden ring takes place in the Pokémon universe
[3:49:12] <fierysnowflakes> THE MIND GOBLINS ATTACK IN FULL FORCE
[3:49:17] <+Javaa01> Just become a mountain goat
[3:49:30] <%whyskeywolfe> yea sure
[3:49:32] <joodatious> maybe?
[3:49:34] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[3:49:37] <+GallowsDrop> I hope so
[3:49:37] <%cade_calrayn> Nah. Probably the Capital
[3:49:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i hope that they fully describe what parts of the story were written by grr martin and which parts were made by the fromsoft team
[3:49:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> cant remember
[3:49:39] <%Valdorick> Eeeeeeeh
[3:49:41] <%raggedwharfrat> How do you like the giant creepy singing bats, Pat?
[3:49:42] <+alphonseisbest> @peachy996 he wrote the lore and mythology, so the demi-gods are all him
[3:49:42] <+pectusumbra> I mean it's a souls game and it sucks ass so probably
[3:49:42] <tolloponik> @sirrice77 damn well I know were to go next
[3:49:46] <%bruuzer12> @ranryu692 and rewards are better than "cool weapon you'll use for 5 minutes, then I breaks"
[3:49:48] <penitentpendant> Hmm. I mean they have that Faith Beast Trainer there, that you've met?
[3:49:48] <%whyskeywolfe> Who needs more faith than people ravaged by plague?
[3:49:51] <%cade_calrayn> I'd say give the Plateau a try for searching for Faith weapons
[3:49:51] <@QueequegTheater> Then you want to go forward
[3:49:53] <plaguedoctor_vi> from my experience on it i did not find any
[3:49:54] <joodatious> you might have to wait till volcano land
[3:49:56] <Sunstalker> Gargoyle halberd Pat. They're black and gold.
[3:49:56] <%JoshManVGH> The place your going sounds like the Faith place, honestly
[3:49:57] <%JohnAtDawn> Yea actually
[3:49:58] <lockoo404> there were the claws made of words
[3:50:02] <+anoldtoilet> caelid might
[3:50:03] <+alphonseisbest> @Kevlar_Caviar he wrote the lore and mythology, so the demi-gods are all him
[3:50:03] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> No faith in that
[3:50:05] <%zarkazeon> one of the coolest faith weapons is in round table after defeating invader
[3:50:05] <+anoldtoilet> tbh
[3:50:10] <+ELevelsUp> did you kill the tree sentinel at beginning? his halberd quite good
[3:50:12] <%JoshManVGH> It's right under the gold tree and shit
[3:50:15] <This_side_up_153> cipher Pata is cool is you like fists
[3:50:18] <joodatious> also Volcano land is almost as fucked as Caelid so have fun
[3:50:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> There are some pog Faith weapons in this game very pog
[3:50:25] <RubberFistFight> @leaplearning How is that an "issue"? It's literally how the games were designed, it's an artistic choice, and it works for the souls games. Of course it wouldn't work for BOTW because IT'S NOT BOTW.
[3:50:27] <+Leftovermemes> all the cool magicish weapons im seeing are str int
[3:50:28] <%Cozy90> dude heroes grave is kicking my ass right now haha
[3:50:29] <+stellarseeker> you already got the item
[3:50:32] <RubberFistFight> they're fundamentally different games.
[3:50:34] <%GabeSweetMan> @bruuzer12 I will absolutely agree that at a certain point, having encounter rewards be "cool, fragile weapon" becomes a chore.
[3:50:36] <%JoshManVGH> The FaithSabers are cool though
[3:50:42] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @alphonseisbest i don't know much about GRRM's work but if he wrote the lore for rykard then dang i gotta read his shit
[3:50:42] <peachy996> I'm not impressed by this story but Story is not why you're playing a Fromsoft game anyway.
[3:50:43] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Hey @PatStaresAt did you her about Artesian Builds?
[3:50:43] <meloshav> yo pat if you jump of the cliff you'll get a secret shortcut back to the bonfire
[3:50:46] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Come along take my hand let’s go to volcano land
[3:50:49] <%epide> HEH HEH PATS COMMITING ASSULT AND BATERY HEH HEH
[3:50:52] <sirrice77> @tolloponik yeah so like i don't wanna spoil anything but there's spells in raya, sellens quest has you find spells with RIDICULOUS requirements, and in selia theres a npc near it that if you help will sell you some spells too
[3:50:53] <penitentpendant> I mean, I'm glad reverse blight town doesn't have THAT much poison (So far?)
[3:50:53] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> There is a VERY good one in Caelid that you might have to farm for, its another scythe tho
[3:50:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> OH I love this singing
[3:50:57] <binku_muja_> round two bat lady!
[3:50:57] <+TheBitingIrish> I heard there was a sword like the faith fist
[3:50:59] <%BinaryFireball> sing on deez nutz
[3:50:59] <kinkade_77> late game incantations are soo cool
[3:51:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Well never LUL
[3:51:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> Jebaited
[3:51:04] <+Pachi3000> the squad
[3:51:08] <binku_muja_> your not slipping away this time!
[3:51:10] <x2Twistedx> these ladybats make sick
[3:51:11] <DestroPrime83> Pope Bats?
[3:51:14] <%GabeSweetMan> BATS, WE'RE BAT, WE'RE THE BATS
[3:51:15] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I think you get a faith weapon for beating the boss of this dungeon
[3:51:18] <leaplearning> @chimaera24 it makes the game constraint, you are walking around the ruins of dead cultures fighting enemies powered by magic with outposts of whatever surviving NPCs there are. There is not much you can do with that kind of story telling.
[3:51:18] <rosabellamelantha> Beating Rennala doesn't mess with anything in Ranni's quest right?
[3:51:25] <+alphonseisbest> @Kevlar_Caviar HE'S a VERY GOOD writter , WHEN he chooses to write something
[3:51:25] <joodatious> @bruuzer12 its truely awful
[3:51:25] <luciluxlu0> yo Quickstep great axe is so nasty in this game
[3:51:29] <%Dew217> Now I'll never hear the end of that sweet song RIP weird Singing Bat
[3:51:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Its a shame such great singing has to come out of blood thirsty monsters
[3:51:36] <%furiousfurioso> god I hate the bats
[3:51:48] <penitentpendant> @GabeSweetMan ...They eat all the fools?
[3:51:53] <@QueequegTheater> goddamn bats
[3:51:55] <Maids4lyfe> what status was that?
[3:51:56] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Maybe look up
[3:51:56] <%cade_calrayn> @rosabellamelantha the details to that is spoilers, but yes
[3:52:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @alphonseisbest can they just like... release his notes for the ER lore
[3:52:04] <plaguedoctor_vi> @rosabellamelantha not that i am aware, i did beat Rennala and still am doing her quest
[3:52:07] <joodatious> nothing worse then getting a cool weapon and it breaking against fucking basic enemies because durability in open world games is garbage and just promotes cheesing
[3:52:09] <%bruuzer12> Where did Pat find the lightning?
[3:52:11] <kinkade_77> how do you get the round table guy to sell more incantations
[3:52:11] <DestroPrime83> Why ae bats singing Holy Roman hymes?
[3:52:12] <%GabeSweetMan> @penitentpendant All those foolish, filthy tarnished.
[3:52:12] <RubberFistFight> @leaplearning and yet Fromsoft have made that formula work what, 5 or 6 times by now? Wow, it sure does suck for them that a random dude on the internet thinks that kind of worldbuilding is "thematically empty".
[3:52:19] <penitentpendant> Vaati eatin' good for the next 2 years
[3:52:20] <%cade_calrayn> if you haven't started Ranni's quest by the time you beat Renalla, you have to do Absolution to fix Ranni
[3:52:21] <%bruuzer12> gotta become a sunbro again
[3:52:22] <%JoshManVGH> A game has never been more justified in its delays
[3:52:26] <%Dew217> They give you jump mechanic and they  scale the size of the map 100x
[3:52:26] <%Crookedspiral> Vati is employed forever now
[3:52:28] <@QueequegTheater> Vaati has like 5 years of content
[3:52:30] <+Javaa01> Everyone has their work cut out
[3:52:31] <%AnthroMetal> Vaati has the next 5 years of content now
[3:52:32] <AtisutoCurry> vaati can make vids for fucken years now
[3:52:33] <@QueequegTheater> Just in Limgrave
[3:52:34] <+Javaa01> There's too much game
[3:52:35] <+twdlrr> Vaati job security the game
[3:52:35] <%Crookedspiral> Endless content
[3:52:39] <leaplearning> @RubberFistFight just because people buy the game doesn't make the game good
[3:52:40] <joodatious> like why ever use rare weapons in botw when you can just use bombs and get away with it
[3:52:40] <peachy996> 5 or 6 times is a stretch
[3:52:42] <Ner234> Vaati eating good for the next ten years
[3:52:44] <%Nobrev> ok but the important question is when's happy souls elden ring edition?
[3:52:44] <terrible35> @leaplearning thats entirely your take on it and i couldnt agree less
[3:52:46] <%AnthroMetal> gg @QueequegTheater
[3:52:47] <tolloponik> going to have to make a damn history book
[3:52:51] <SomeAsianDood> Vaati has his 401k set
[3:52:54] <joodatious> The wikis aren't even close to being done lol
[3:52:54] <%whyskeywolfe> He's just a badass.
[3:52:55] <+pectusumbra> team up with Zullie the Witch?
[3:52:58] <peachy996> Bloodborne, Dark Souls and Demon Souls sure
[3:53:00] <%GabeSweetMan> @RubberFistFight I'm really not sure why there's an ongoing argument in chat comparing BotW and Elden RIng.... like these are both classics that will live on for years. Why are we shitting on either of them???
[3:53:01] <penitentpendant> The big pain would be if there's anything mutually exclusive via questlines
[3:53:02] <%BinaryFireball> get that AI to do it lol
[3:53:02] <peachy996> It worked
[3:53:04] <KR_Black> i have 5 years of ASMR to wait for
[3:53:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> At least the lore in this game is waaaay less complex he'll have a much easier time deciphering it all
[3:53:09] <peachy996> It did not work for DSII
[3:53:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I adore this singing
[3:53:15] <rosabellamelantha> Well that makes sense you ARE beating up her mother
[3:53:16] <joodatious> @penitentpendant there are
[3:53:16] <+mup420> How those squids get up there?
[3:53:17] <plaguedoctor_vi> @bruuzer12 there  a knight in the ray lucaria zone that drop a book that can be used to get the lightning
[3:53:18] <Midnight188> what about Lance McDonalnd? He already found the developer camera...
[3:53:20] <+RedMaskBandit> another nerd fight in chat?
[3:53:22] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> I assume vati was retiring after seeing all of this
[3:53:24] <AtisutoCurry> THE DREAM TEAM
[3:53:25] <%BinaryFireball> the lore is less complex but there is sooo much more lore
[3:53:28] <artoflec> i dont give a shit about anything happening in this game i just wanna see cool monsters
[3:53:28] <joodatious> there is ALOT of missable content
[3:53:29] <%bruuzer12> BonfireVN too
[3:53:32] <%tetraes> those bats freak me tf out
[3:53:33] <+Leftovermemes> i love this music
[3:53:33] <sothatsprettybrutal> from releases grrm's lore and it's just a filled out form saying "souls = runes, undead = tarnished" etc etc
[3:53:35] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight I'm not shitting on either, but that guy seems to think that because souls doesn't do what BOTW does, that souls is empty and bereft of meaning/quality.
[3:53:36] <joodatious> its close just go up
[3:53:38] <+RedMaskBandit> the bat song is beautiful
[3:53:41] <leaplearning> @GabeSweetMan centrist takes are boring and contribute nothing.
[3:53:42] <ape_hawk> midpoint grace hole?
[3:53:43] <schiester420> yo these bat choirs fucknig slap tho
[3:53:45] <%bruuzer12> @plaguedoctor_vi sick, thank you
[3:53:45] <Grave_Titan_D> what about Iron Pineapple
[3:53:45] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> I can’t believe it’s not butter
[3:53:46] <Maids4lyfe> the bat has a nice singing voice
[3:53:47] <SomeAsianDood> OLEG
[3:53:48] <Frranky> oleg my man
[3:53:48] <%BinaryFireball> hell yea oleg
[3:53:48] <%GabeSweetMan> They have different strengths and weaknesses. I still need to beat Elden Ring and let it stew in my brain to decide if I like it better but I'm not gonna start shitting on BotW if I decide I like it better.
[3:53:49] <ziggy_1031> first D&D edition wars and now BOTW/Elden Ring, is something in the water today chat? you guys just board?
[3:53:50] <joodatious> go up the lift pat
[3:53:52] <%BinaryFireball> fucking love oleg
[3:53:58] <tolloponik> I can't believe they don't have guardrails here
[3:53:59] <%cade_calrayn> Maahhhhh booooiiii
[3:54:00] <RubberFistFight> @sothatsprettybrutal he's got one page with "try finger but hole" scribbled on it
[3:54:01] <%Puhff> WHO'S SINGING
[3:54:02] <Xelhesia> yeyeye oleg
[3:54:06] <+tizziks> Has Pat tried the archer lady summon yet?
[3:54:07] <%cade_calrayn> I got Oleg this morning and he's my stand now
[3:54:08] <+PkSilent01> @PatStaresAt I killed the Invader in the roundtable. How do I get his scythe
[3:54:10] <%BinaryFireball> that one has a crown
[3:54:11] <%Valdorick> What level is Pat's Oleg anyway?
[3:54:13] <+Grayhammatter> what the fuck!
[3:54:14] <%barrakuta371> they shoot skulls now
[3:54:14] <penitentpendant> Necromancer Bats
[3:54:15] <Frranky> @tizziks the bat was singing
[3:54:18] <+pectusumbra> Bat Harpies aren't a bad mix up
[3:54:21] <%Valdorick> The bat throws magic pots
[3:54:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> always have been
[3:54:26] <%furiousfurioso> the random octopi always gets me, how did you get here baby octopus
[3:54:32] <RubberFistFight> @ziggy_1031 nah, stans for other games are just salty Elden Ring is popular and massively successful. The Cyberpunk ones are particularly hilarious.
[3:54:41] <+pectusumbra> oh she dropped something@!
[3:54:42] <penitentpendant> BrOleg bein' a good off tank
[3:54:42] <heartlesshealer> you tried bats, now have harpies
[3:54:44] <rosabellamelantha> is respawning even canon in Elden ring? every tarnished that's killed here stays dead it feels like they only get 1 actual revive
[3:54:45] <binku_muja_> I think it was the other bat that attacked you.
[3:54:47] <AngryAsian5> Love you Oleg
[3:54:48] <Frranky> oleg put him in the blender
[3:54:50] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Wise choice summon ing
[3:54:52] <rosabellamelantha> and that revive was offscreen
[3:54:54] <%Nobrev> the insane scarcity of first level smithing stones feels unintentional because I have dozens of higher level smithing stones but only like 3 first level
[3:54:57] <+pectusumbra> dat siren dropped something!
[3:54:59] <SomeAsianDood> Cyberpunk has stans?
[3:55:01] <heartlesshealer> oh item drop
[3:55:05] <ziggy_1031> @ziggy_1031 I didn't even know cyberpunk had fans or that they were mad at this game lol
[3:55:06] <KasiCrafter> Oleg may or may not need some upgrading
[3:55:09] <peachy996> @ziggy_1031 All I'm saying ER has the gameplay/overworld/content advantage BOTW has the story advantage
[3:55:11] <+pectusumbra> ah, got ya
[3:55:13] <RubberFistFight> @SomeAsianDood yes, bafflingly.
[3:55:14] <radiorosewater> oleg put him in the vortex
[3:55:15] <+Javaa01> A little immolation, as a treat
[3:55:16] <+anoldtoilet> @SomeAsianDood it was a fine game
[3:55:22] <joodatious> @Nobrev yeah its weird but i think you can buy them?
[3:55:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @furiousfurioso It wants to follow you on adventures but is too shy to ask
[3:55:23] <%Valdorick> Remember Chat, if you have to Preface the description of the boss with "secret", then don't add information.
[3:55:24] <+Dosp5> Am I crazy or did one of the bats say something?
[3:55:27] <+anoldtoilet> lol i dont know why anyone is mad about this one but i really liked cyberpunk
[3:55:29] <@QueequegTheater> @peachy996 And I'm telling you two to stop arguing
[3:55:31] <+anoldtoilet> thought it was fun and had good writing
[3:55:32] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Nobrev they're supposed to be a common drop from the basic soldier enemies but i feel like their drop rates are bugged
[3:55:38] <+Pachi3000> yet\
[3:55:38] <sirrice77> @Nobrev do you want to know where you can buy them?
[3:55:45] <penitentpendant> @Dosp5 The 'harpies' sing until in combat
[3:55:51] <RubberFistFight> @SomeAsianDood sure, aside from all the jank and bugs and the fact that it was built on lies and investor fraud.
[3:55:52] <%whyskeywolfe> Nah but remember the landsquid can knock you back
[3:55:56] <SomeAsianDood> @anoldtoilet yeah it's perfectly competent and that's why I'm surprised it has stans. Usually a game has to go either way to have stans if you know what I mean
[3:55:59] <%GabeSweetMan> @leaplearning Nuance, not centrist. Both have strength and weaknesses that are not directly comparable to one another. I'm agreeing and disagreeing with arguments from both sides but Elden Ring JUST came out. We're diving into really broad discussions without having had the time to digest Elden Ring yet. I've only just beaten Godrick so I've got a LOT to go but I'm loving everything I've see so far.
[3:56:01] <artoflec> why rooftop octopus
[3:56:07] <joodatious> YEAH
[3:56:10] <+anoldtoilet> @SomeAsianDood so, every game in history ever?
[3:56:17] <%OrangeMDT> Why are these octopi even here??
[3:56:18] <fierysnowflakes> @artoflec Because yes
[3:56:20] <peachy996> Actually this game makes it clear that Fromsoft is at their best when they're not making sequels
[3:56:22] <joodatious> man those octopuses got parkour moves
[3:56:23] <artoflec> pat how octopus get up there
[3:56:25] <+Cecrios> Lighttown
[3:56:25] <penitentpendant> And there's still poison
[3:56:29] <+RedMaskBandit> where can I buy the +1 stones?
[3:56:30] <sothatsprettybrutal> tarnished are called "ye dead who yet live" so they're at least quasi-canonically undead?
[3:56:34] <+anoldtoilet> @Cecrios lol
[3:56:39] <peachy996> This is much better than DS2 maybe even DS3
[3:56:40] <radiorosewater> woolieONEGUY woolieVS woolieONEGUY woolieVS woolieONEGUY
[3:56:40] <Glockroach2774> So. how terrible does Babylon'sf all look lol
[3:56:42] <%Kevlar_Caviar> YEAH MT GELMIR
[3:56:43] <+Grayhammatter> oh that's cool
[3:56:45] <+Pachi3000> that's rad
[3:56:46] <%Kevlar_Caviar> BADASS AREA
[3:56:49] <+anoldtoilet> tarnished are undead led by grace
[3:56:53] <joodatious> you're gonna get ANOTHER sick sword soon too
[3:56:53] <SomeAsianDood> what every game isn't super bad or super good? @anoldtoilet
[3:56:54] <+anoldtoilet> but a lot of tarnished dont see the grace anymore
[3:56:56] <+pectusumbra> what's the scaling?
[3:56:58] <Ghufufin> its a snek
[3:56:58] <Saltmeisterr> @Glockroach2774 really bad
[3:56:58] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Looks like Falchion moveset
[3:57:01] <%Cozy90> carthus curved sword 2?
[3:57:02] <+TheBitingIrish> Wait, does it cause poison?
[3:57:04] <KR_Black> OK yeah , that sword fucks
[3:57:07] <%abakkus> nice floating green polygon down there lmao
[3:57:08] <+pectusumbra> *nod*
[3:57:08] <penitentpendant> @Glockroach2774 Death Knell of Platinum, for the pessimistic
[3:57:10] <mellshone> Hey does pat have a new wife yet?
[3:57:13] <+alphonseisbest> @peachy996 ds3 ain't hard to beat ds1 is better
[3:57:16] <plaguedoctor_vi> Hey Pat now that i think about it that halberd from the church boss a faith weapon?
[3:57:17] <rosabellamelantha> I would like to point out that people keep shitting on DS2 even though Elden Ring takes a lot from DS2 and the co director is LITERALLY DS2 MAN
[3:57:19] <radiorosewater> carthus curved sword
[3:57:20] <joodatious> pretend its visual pat
[3:57:24] <%Valdorick> Reach out, and touch grace

[3:57:42] <plaguedoctor_vi> so why not try to use it?
[3:57:42] <heartlesshealer> anything could be real with a double jump
[3:57:43] <%SaiyanShoto> I’m still trying to find a good weapon with blood loss
[3:57:43] <wolverinewaswrong> I love this boss
[3:57:43] <+tizziks> Harpy boss?
[3:57:46] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha I KNEW it felt distinctly like DS2 in places, i thought i was imagining things.
[3:57:50] <+Grayhammatter> touch grace
[3:57:50] <penitentpendant> BrOleg!
[3:57:52] <+alphonseisbest> @rosabellamelantha lol RIGHT, its even cleary that team that lead this one
[3:57:52] <peachy996> Keep shitting on DS2? Okay Kappa
[3:57:53] <%GabeSweetMan> New Boss, Who Diss?
[3:57:55] <%Valdorick> Funny you say that

[3:59:13] <RubberFistFight> "gaping quelaag" o_O
[3:59:14] <ohno58> Gapelaag
[3:59:14] <%Buzzard42> this feels like a Monster Hunter fight

[3:59:20] <%barrakuta371> 1at try
[3:59:20] <PraiseHemra> killing this boss skipped a different one on the other side of the map for me
[3:59:21] <%whyskeywolfe> Nicely done.
[3:59:21] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I don't think I've heard a single person actually confirm there are tail drops, so I would think there aren't
[3:59:23] <sirrice77> Fun fact if you bought prawns, you can summon prawn guy here to help
[3:59:24] <fierysnowflakes> That was surprisingly simple
[3:59:25] <+anoldtoilet> yeah a lot of elden ring feels like "ds2 but good"
[3:59:26] <DestroPrime83> dude was kinda a bitch
[3:59:27] <Frranky> sean connery!
[3:59:28] <+RedMaskBandit> no tails in this game?
[3:59:29] <binku_muja_> and now, we feast.

[4:01:14] <%livlinn> Maffs
[4:01:15] <rosabellamelantha> @joodatious when did I ever imply that, please get reading comprehension skills. I stated that Tanimura is the co-director and the game takes a lot from DS2 which is DOES. Those are facts, I never said it was majority DS2 people
[4:01:17] <Rbeatononefour> go for a jog, lose some fat
[4:01:24] <%JoshManVGH> FUCK
[4:01:25] <+ithonmage> that's not a sword, it's an old testamate jawbone

[4:01:31] <DestroPrime83> You have 39K souls if thats enoug to level Endur?
[4:01:33] <KR_Black> Take of your shoes Kappa
[4:01:39] <AtisutoCurry> THIS THING FUCKS
[4:01:40] <binku_muja_> recovery takes a bit too long if it doesn't gank your enemies.
[4:01:42] <%Valdorick> Just spend your 40K souls on 1 endurance Kappa
[4:01:42] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> PAT KEEP THIS AND NEVER LET IT GO
[4:01:56] <%weeniebrandini> Cheer1000 ok that's sick, I totally overlooked that weapon
[4:02:04] <@QueequegTheater> @joodatious @rosabellamelantha Stop arguing
[4:02:21] <%GabeSweetMan> Man chat is spicy tonight.
[4:02:31] <SomeAsianDood> One guy vs One guy Pog
[4:02:40] <binku_muja_> still too chunk
[4:02:44] <radiorosewater> woolieONEGUY woolieVS woolieONEGUY
[4:02:46] <fierysnowflakes> I can feel Pat's braincells working overtime for cool sword
[4:02:55] <+polothegreatest> plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps
[4:02:55] <+RedMaskBandit> thanks Mod.
[4:02:56] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater Joodatious honestly seems to just want to pick fights.
[4:02:57] <peachy996> Needs more exile
[4:03:04] <radiorosewater> punks in chat tonight
[4:03:06] <penitentpendant> Fashion Souls at it's finest!
[4:03:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Boy I sure do like enjoying multiple games for completely different reasons that may not be entirely rational.
[4:03:13] <rosabellamelantha> The sword is really cool but I just can't use UGS, they always feel too clunky to me
[4:03:14] <djblue_shift> don't you have enough to level end?
[4:03:14] <%Nobrev> I love that the game just tells you your weight right under your equip load numbers. the light/mid/heavy load text
[4:03:21] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> DO it Pat
[4:03:22] <DestroPrime83> hw much load will he get if he levels endurance 1?
[4:03:26] <penitentpendant> More stamina! Huzzah!
[4:03:41] <+RedMaskBandit> like the third argument tonight
[4:03:43] <fierysnowflakes> Thank the gods for that one needle thing, or whatever it was called
[4:03:46] <SomeAsianDood> Oh shit Bender is back
[4:03:46] <KasiCrafter> You can always use a Rune Arc to jack up your stats s you can carry more
[4:03:57] <%GabeSweetMan> @Nobrev I appreciate that chunk of text so much.
[4:04:10] <peachy996> @SomeAsianDood Oh did he get his deal?
[4:04:11] <%whyskeywolfe> @SomeAsianDood They get diMaggio?
[4:04:12] <@QueequegTheater> Maybe pump Vig and End to 20
[4:04:15] <RubberFistFight> @Nobrev there have been a lot of QOL changes to de-obfuscate some of the mechanics. Somehow still not enough to appease the "iT's ToO haRd aNd ConFuSiNg" whiners who want a "journalism mode".
[4:04:22] <SomeAsianDood> Yup @whyskeywolfe @peachy996
[4:04:31] <peachy996> Good for Dimaggio, get paid.
[4:04:41] <%Nobrev> @Nobrev it's a godsend so I dont need to crunch the numbers myself like pat was just now for some reason
[4:04:51] <peachy996> You need all of the Futurama cast because they don't just voice one character
[4:04:54] <binku_muja_> @RubberFistFight Journalist mode? so they want the game to play itself then.
[4:04:55] <%cade_calrayn> Cue Paige showing up and demanding that Pat show feet
[4:04:59] <%GabeSweetMan> I had a good laugh at that reddit post that stuff Ubisoft and GTA HUDs over top.
[4:05:14] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> We notice
[4:05:19] <%xcompleasedad> You have Gold Runes for a level
[4:05:28] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> FBtouchdown FBtouchdown FBtouchdown
[4:05:37] <DestroPrime83> Will you ever Endurance zgrind off screen?
[4:05:50] <RubberFistFight> @binku_muja_ yes, basically. They want the fundamental underpinnings of the game to be completely altered just so they don't have to try as hard, and they try to hide behind the shield of "but muh accessibility tho".
[4:05:51] <+alphonseisbest> ye
[4:05:57] <narusao> LUL
[4:06:07] <%za7az> TOS WutFace
[4:06:07] <DestroPrime83> MY EYYYEES!
[4:06:08] <+alphonseisbest> THE WOLF HEAD STAYS ON
[4:06:10] <+alphonseisbest> ALWAYS
[4:06:11] <peachy996> Wolf Hat and remove the clothes
[4:06:11] <+gruff_gridof> doodLewd doodLewd
[4:06:13] <%Valdorick> 20 is the recommended for most of the 'utility' stats, it looks like.
[4:06:15] <peachy996> It's a nice look
[4:06:15] <Xelhesia> LUL
[4:06:16] <+alphonseisbest> SICK
[4:06:20] <artoflec> eh, there are a lot of people that also just want accessbility options
[4:06:21] <T_Sasquatch> Edgeeeeeee
[4:06:22] <LuminusVows> nice
[4:06:23] <peachy996> Eh fine that works too
[4:06:24] <DestroPrime83> BALD! BALD! BALD!
[4:06:25] <peachy996> I guess
[4:06:33] <artoflec> you know, like a pause button.
[4:06:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Respec is in college I believe? Info is still updating so afiak I still need to find that something key.
[4:06:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Glintstone Key I think?
[4:06:42] <%tentavision> Double Scythes?!?
[4:06:45] <peachy996> Fine. It looks fucking cool
[4:06:50] <%Nobrev> what scythes are those? they look cool
[4:06:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> b4 going back follow the path a bit
[4:06:51] <%whyskeywolfe> Welcome to the Mountain of Only Good Times.
[4:06:55] <T_Sasquatch> Easy mode is not an accessibility option. There i said it
[4:06:56] <%jamsbybetty> you thought the rest of the game was gold, get fukken ready
[4:06:57] <peachy996> You look even more like Zen Aku from Power Rangers
[4:07:03] <%Dakuu75> Nice fang theme
[4:07:04] <%xcompleasedad> Oat Milk is fucking nasty. Never again
[4:07:05] <%BinaryFireball> ah damn i missed the boss
[4:07:07] <meloshav> some accessibility I think takes away from the intended product, like having an audio description for a silent movie
[4:07:08] <RubberFistFight> @artoflec and there are plenty of people who are seriously physically disabled who have beat these games with ease and really don't like people claiming the difficulty is an "accessibility problem".
[4:07:13] <DestroPrime83> Hell yeah
[4:07:25] <+Grayhammatter> what the hell?
[4:07:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Go north a bit
[4:07:27] <digaogrunge> Your feet are claws
[4:07:28] <dds333a> I thought that said "Atlus" for a second
[4:07:30] <Grave_Titan_D> loot?
[4:07:32] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> ooks like a landslide
[4:07:33] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah so the Altus Plateau is very yellow/orange
[4:07:33] <meloshav> a pause button would be nice, but I think they have trouble programming it with the multiplayer
[4:07:34] <+RealMichaelPhelps> touch the grace hole
[4:07:41] <%GabeSweetMan> @RubberFistFight Like that paraplegic who beasted Monk in Sekiro? That video is awesome.
[4:07:42] <penitentpendant> Path of Sacrifice vibe from DS3
[4:07:42] <artoflec> @RubberFistFight yes, that doesnt mean there are people that still would like/require accessbility options. This isnt an argument about difficulty, its about accessbility.
[4:07:51] <RubberFistFight> @artoflec A pause button? If you need to pause, save and log out. The game literally saves everything up until that point so you lose nothing, and if you leave it on the title screen it's literally two button pushes to get back in.
[4:07:52] <%Valdorick> Yeah, so, you're in the second half of the game here
[4:07:55] <dds333a> RIP
[4:07:58] <heartlesshealer> double scythe double windup
[4:07:59] <+tizziks> It's Albus cause they are harry potter fans
[4:08:00] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt that Site of Grace is called "Abandoned Coffin" - apparently those things are coffins, not carriages
[4:08:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> forgot bout these guys
[4:08:03] <binku_muja_> @RubberFistFight accessibility is an issue for some players. but some journo's are just lazy and trying to bluff their way through 'reviewing' games that take more effort.
[4:08:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> cool shit on top of hill
[4:08:11] <+Javaa01> Yeah the blighttown ogres beefed up a bit between games
[4:08:15] <DestroPrime83> is pat gonna use the greatsword or wait to upgrade it?
[4:08:17] <%whyskeywolfe> I mean, maybe just run on ahead.
[4:08:20] <T_Sasquatch> I Dont get the desire for a pause button. Just chill at a bonfire/grace
[4:08:24] <@QueequegTheater> @artoflec @RubberFistFight This discussion is @binku_muja_ Please stop this discussion, it's going to lead to an argument
[4:08:28] <artoflec> @RubberFistFight thats not a pause button though lol
[4:08:32] <+alphonseisbest> ARE YOU COMING BACK?
[4:08:35] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight not sure if it's the same one, but Donovan (cripp daddy) on twitter posted a video of him dominating several bosses, and he has advanced spinal muscular atrophy.
[4:08:35] <@QueequegTheater> Whoops, mistyped it lmao
[4:08:48] <+alphonseisbest> booo T_T
[4:08:48] <ziggy_1031> thank you mods, chat is wild tonight
[4:08:54] <meloshav> he's not coming bak
[4:08:59] <+alphonseisbest> yay
[4:09:03] <penitentpendant> Time to empty the dog
[4:09:05] <@QueequegTheater> Never coming back FeelsBadMan
[4:09:07] <%IvanMistwalker> ye
[4:09:13] <dds333a> RIP IRL Pat
[4:09:15] <artoflec> oh sure, i figured it was an alright thing to bring up 😂 some people get too heated about options
[4:09:15] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> one of these days zangief is just gonna eat pat
[4:09:18] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat's gonna fight Rayquaza Lucario.
[4:09:18] <%Valdorick> I miss Chat, you just never get this in the YT uploads LUL
[4:09:19] <+theoldone001> Gief has to take Pat out to pee
[4:09:21] <meloshav> what a shame this is the last we ever saw of pat
[4:09:32] <%Mister_McDerp> you chatters sure are a contentious people
[4:09:44] <SomeAsianDood> Chatters ruined chatting
[4:09:46] <@QueequegTheater> @artoflec No hard feelings.  Just trying to keep chat as civil as possible
[4:09:49] <peachy996> Pat never returned that day
[4:09:51] <dds333a> @mister_mcderp I feed on anger
[4:10:03] <@QueequegTheater> And on this day, Paige finally turned Pat into a skeleton
[4:10:03] <ziggy_1031> if it wasn't for chat helping Pat I would suggest he go emote only mode LUL
[4:10:28] <radiorosewater> click on the little arrow above chat, it closes it
[4:10:31] <+theoldone001> Pat literally wants to be spoiled on what to do, he doesn't give a shit lol
[4:10:34] <artoflec> i finally saw someone uncover the whole map today on stream, at least, we're pretty sure its the whole map lol
[4:10:40] <meloshav> Pat should put in a profanity filter, so you cannot chat without swearing
[4:10:42] <%GabeSweetMan> Chat is a double edge sword. Sometimes chat makes me laugh harder than Pat and Paige.
[4:10:51] <peachy996> How's Woolie handling this open world fuck you and explore experience
[4:11:04] <%Mister_McDerp> will we ever know if the map is complete or not?
[4:11:10] <@QueequegTheater> @Mister_McDerp no
[4:11:14] <ziggy_1031> chat is like a car wreck, you can't look away
[4:11:16] <%BinaryFireball> it legit takes about 60+ hours to reveal the whole map if you're not rushing it
[4:11:17] <meloshav> Is dog ever not hungry
[4:11:17] <ape_hawk> so he ATE pee?
[4:11:18] <%Buzzard42> doggo
[4:11:18] <%SaiyanShoto> He’s alive!
[4:11:19] <dds333a> It was ruse
[4:11:21] <+theoldone001> @peachy996 Terribly. He went down the fabled elevator and lost his mind on where to go lol
[4:11:22] <@QueequegTheater> Map being expanded in real time
[4:11:23] <rosabellamelantha> NGL sometimes I wish I had a chat to help me out this game is TOO HUGE
[4:11:27] <tolloponik> washed your hands?
[4:11:29] <RubberFistFight> @theoldone001 probably because previous streams taught him that cryptic advice designed to avoid "spoilers" just leads to bad things, like when Kentaro's quest got fucked up in Sekiro.
[4:11:29] <%GabeSweetMan> @peachy996 Presumably he is spending 5 minutes to assess every 2 enemy encounter and runs in to get murdered anyways.
[4:11:32] <+AyupaPupa> dog
[4:11:33] <%whyskeywolfe> What's she at now?
[4:11:39] <@QueequegTheater> 25 days
[4:11:43] <+Grayhammatter> she is
[4:11:44] <peachy996> @theoldone001 ahhhh poor guy.
[4:11:48] <%Treuan> Can you imagine going almost a full month non stop?
[4:11:49] <%Buzzard42> LUL
[4:11:50] <%GabeSweetMan> LMAO
[4:11:51] <dds333a> The fuckthrough
[4:11:52] <artoflec> LUL
[4:11:54] <+wizard_of_diamonds> WOW
[4:11:54] <RubberFistFight> @peachy996 Woolie? Overthinking things? That doesn't sound like him... Kappa
[4:11:54] <dds333a> LUL
[4:11:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Never chase those on torrent
[4:11:57] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:11:58] <Xelhesia> LUL
[4:11:59] <%whyskeywolfe> @QueequegTheater Wait, what?
[4:12:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[4:12:04] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Thanks Elden Ring
[4:12:06] <%IvanMistwalker> we saw that
[4:12:09] <@QueequegTheater> @whyskeywolfe 25 day long subathon
[4:12:13] <@QueequegTheater> Still ongoing
[4:12:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Those bats do WAY more damage than you'd ever anticipate.
[4:12:48] <ziggy_1031> @whyskeywolfe how is she ugh, sleeping or surviving lol
[4:12:48] <%BinaryFireball> she gonna go for a full month I think
[4:12:49] <%whyskeywolfe> Doesn't she need to like, sleep?
[4:12:55] <binku_muja_> haven't looked in on woolie's play yet. Is Min or Reggie co-hosting?
[4:12:57] <%BinaryFireball> she sleeps on stream
[4:12:59] <%Dementedpenguin> She sleeps
[4:13:00] <@QueequegTheater> @whyskeywolfe Twitch has a sleep category
[4:13:02] <%Mister_McDerp> sleep is for the weak
[4:13:06] <+TheBitingIrish> I found the Eye of Sauron monkaS
[4:13:08] <Xelhesia> reggie
[4:13:09] <sothatsprettybrutal> reggie is on the woolie stream
[4:13:09] <radiorosewater> @binku_muja_ reggie is
[4:13:15] <Shiibbae> He’s overthinking as per usual but he’s gettin progress done, killed tree sentinel so that’s cool @peachy996
[4:13:17] <%BinaryFireball> i am weak and im ok
[4:13:17] <%whyskeywolfe> She sleeps on STREAM?
[4:13:18] <@QueequegTheater> @TheBitingIrish Yeah i ran into that too lmao
[4:13:21] <HotSauceFiend> I was worried that these streams would be big spoilers, but i think the game is SO big that I cant keep track of anything
[4:13:26] <%GabeSweetMan> Wait that sub-athon is still going? Jesus fuck
[4:13:31] <penitentpendant> Beat Tree Sentinel
[4:13:32] <@QueequegTheater> @whyskeywolfe She's a vtuber so it's not actually on camera
[4:13:33] <%whyskeywolfe> He just found the Siofra river today.
[4:13:39] <Xelhesia> he beat tree sentinal
[4:13:42] <peachy996> It's not Woolie's caution and overthinking I feel bad for, it's his need to clear the map in his head. I can't imagine how tough that would be for him
[4:13:42] <CaptainBright> Woolie got mindbroken with the underground lift
[4:13:43] <binku_muja_> @QueequegTheater I thought they banned sleep streams? They have a category for it now?
[4:13:43] <RubberFistFight> @TheBitingIrish me toooo
[4:13:44] <penitentpendant> He found Underworld then noped out
[4:13:45] <+pectusumbra> He stumbled into the underground and killed tree sentinal to close the end
[4:13:49] <+theoldone001> He's gotten lost on the variety of locations lol
[4:13:50] <meloshav> I'm pretty sure woolie finished already
[4:13:50] <%Buzzard42> Try finger, but hole
[4:13:51] <radiorosewater> overthinking everything
[4:13:56] <plaguedoctor_vi> he going at his own pace, it going good i think
[4:14:00] <@QueequegTheater> @binku_muja_ They banned it until they realized they could make money off it lmao
[4:14:05] <%OrangeMDT> A little slow, but he’s doing his best
[4:14:05] <+BoboDaHobo> he's doing everything he can to avoid going to school
[4:14:09] <%whyskeywolfe> @QueequegTheater Ah, that's much better then.
[4:14:11] <rosabellamelantha> Yeah I'm trying my best to be helpful and not be BIG spoilers but I haven't even beaten the game myself yet
[4:14:14] <@QueequegTheater> Woolie REFUSES school
[4:14:17] <Parapattern> Speed
[4:14:24] <sothatsprettybrutal> you can sleep stream only if a hot tub is on camera
[4:14:29] <rosabellamelantha> I just know about the ranni quest cus I did that just a while ago
[4:14:29] <%GabeSweetMan> @binku_muja_ Ah, so the hot tub situation again.

[4:17:24] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL LUL
[4:17:24] <+LandOfTheWay> what's the deal with the 3 fingers?
[4:17:25] <binku_muja_> Well look at this way, if that's the case, you can kill her anyway and fulfill the guys quest once she reaches maiden status.
[4:17:27] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[4:17:33] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it damages you while it's building up too.
[4:17:33] <+Grayhammatter> got hit with the MADNESS

[4:17:38] <+pectusumbra> bring out whatever you need to just delete those rats I guess
[4:17:40] <%bevyrage> PastaRat? More like CastaRat amiright
[4:17:42] <rommlll> this is the sickest build ive seen so far
[4:17:55] <plaguedoctor_vi> yes considering that she been gorging on eyes to get here and that the 3 fingers stuff is raleted to madness i think that a fair assunption
[4:17:55] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt fun fact that eye lady never spawned for me because I killed Irina for the blood dude
[4:17:56] <+pectusumbra> Very true
[4:17:58] <%twistedj3ster> Oh yeah, the Yellow Wallpaper too

[4:18:04] <@QueequegTheater> Good ole Hastur
[4:18:06] <+pectusumbra> Gold itself exerts a madness on people
[4:18:08] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I don't think the existence of the three fingers is supposed to be much a secret
[4:18:10] <peachy996> You saying Paige is mad?
[4:18:11] <%ElkRiverDog> and The Yellow Wallpaper
[4:18:12] <Shiibbae> Y, you were topped up tho, that was just an IK
[4:18:14] <rosabellamelantha> no idea
[4:18:17] <%maskofmichael> Gold is just dark yellow
[4:18:29] <%BinaryFireball> never knew about the king in yellow
[4:18:29] <@QueequegTheater> Wait who the fuck is Irina

[4:18:58] <penitentpendant> So Mustard causes madness because it's yellow? Got it!
[4:18:59] <sothatsprettybrutal> the identical blind woman from the south peninsula is irina right
[4:19:10] <%RealThiele> this plan LUL
[4:19:13] <Shiibbae> Horsey jump
[4:19:14] <DestroPrime83> I cant believe we have to fight Sauron in this game
[4:19:16] <%Nobrev> probably means theres a safe spot to jump down with torrent to a spirit spring
[4:19:19] <dds333a> Just don't look at it Kappa
[4:19:19] <rosabellamelantha> Irina is the girl who asks you to deliver a letter to her father, for some reason if you don't finish her quest eye lady will NOT spawn
[4:19:23] <%Valdorick> Hey Pat, question - do you have a fireball type spell sloted right now?
[4:19:28] <HotSauceFiend> how does madness affect you? or is it like bleed?
[4:19:29] <sirrice77> @pectusumbra well it's based off a certain stat, so if you raise that stat then yeah
[4:19:46] <%Deft_Thought> Man, I missed a lot. Pat's a scythe boy now?
[4:19:46] <%RealThiele> frenzy is fire bleed
[4:19:47] <%GabeSweetMan> I forget, could you sip on ladders in 3?
[4:19:50] <sirrice77> @HotSauceFiend like bleed but also takes fp and makes you fall over or flinch
[4:19:53] <striderzer0> bloodstains still broken?
[4:19:53] <%Valdorick> Well then, enjoy fighting on the roof instead of throwing shit at the floor LUL

[4:20:41] <+xerj> group madness, like mass hysteria?

[4:21:29] <rommlll> how many endings?
[4:21:32] <striderzer0> March Madness
[4:21:34] <+alphonseisbest> @Kevlar_Caviar Probably not, they've not done that is souls before its always been new areas unheard of
[4:21:37] <binku_muja_> Wait. So has she been given the wrong eyes this whole time?
[4:21:38] <rosabellamelantha> 4
[4:21:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 4 endings
[4:21:40] <+Javaa01> @dds333a Nah in this case it's a bad end for everyone
[4:21:40] <%BinaryFireball> i think there are a lot of endings
[4:21:43] <%BinaryFireball> I think*
[4:21:48] <rosabellamelantha> 4 endings this time
[4:21:55] <dds333a> @javaa01 says you Kappa
[4:22:01] <%GabeSweetMan> @striderzer0 Ah of course, these guys are basketball fans. That explains a lot.
[4:22:04] <%whyskeywolfe> They have those out in the prairies.

[4:22:41] <dds333a> @femto216 as we all know
[4:22:45] <%Mister_McDerp> infectious madness is such a cool concept
[4:22:45] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @PatStaresAt If the grapes she's been eating are "Shabriri Grapes" like the madness, is the light she sees when she eats them related to how all the madness spells seem to be related to fire bursting out of people's eyes?
[4:22:49] <NewWillinium> So this place seems nice
[4:22:50] <dan_g_v> mahness

[4:26:23] <@QueequegTheater> @BinaryFireball It's definitely that spot
[4:26:37] <%BinaryFireball> oh maybe I missed it
[4:26:38] <fierysnowflakes> Only in Elden Ring would you get excited for a corpse!
[4:26:40] <+RedMaskBandit> see if it changed the description of the item
[4:26:45] <%BinaryFireball> its a good... thing
[4:26:52] <sothatsprettybrutal> orientaloso its the same woman who now wants a fingerprint grape. loves grapes

[4:28:12] <+RedMaskBandit> it just cause him madness
[4:28:20] <binku_muja_> @striderzer0 on the user probably.
[4:28:28] <Ner234> @HotSauceFiend Maybe refresh. Twitch does weird things to audio sometimes
[4:28:36] <sothatsprettybrutal> weird sound stuff is often twitch trying to get you back up to speed or otherwise fucking up
[4:28:43] <rosabellamelantha> as I haven't beat the game yet I can't speak for the endings but Ranni feels like the intended "good" ending while Madness is like so clearly a bad end choice it's almost laughable
[4:28:43] <rommlll> i can hear some bass rips now
[4:28:56] <%RealThiele> has pat been to the beast church yet?
[4:29:15] <rosabellamelantha> he has

[4:30:05] <%Brassnarwhal> how did the dog squeezing go?
[4:30:07] <oda_flobunaga> Has Pat gotten to the part where Elden Ring becomes a Star Wars crossover and the USS Enterprise shows up. Then Lightning beams down then says, "we really were the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within all along?"  #EldenRingLies
[4:30:17] <%Mister_McDerp> pee flavored ice cream

[4:30:59] <%Valdorick> wait, did Pat luck out at the church? He didn't have to fight anything.l

[4:31:09] <oda_flobunaga> LUL
[4:31:09] <+stellarseeker> something about the walls?
[4:31:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @epide just Godrik
[4:31:13] <%notsoy> what about the part where you see two old 60-year-old siblings fuck each other and talk about songs of fire and ice
[4:31:18] <binku_muja_> @epide just one i think.
[4:31:22] <HotSauceFiend> Have you found the secret apology letter George Martin hid in the game saying he will never finish that book #EldenRingLies

[4:32:21] <Ner234> No take, only throw
[4:32:26] <rosabellamelantha> since that has hyetta's item
[4:32:28] <%cade_calrayn> Yup!

[4:32:39] <penitentpendant> Gravity Wins Again! Curses!
[4:32:41] <RubberFistFight> I'm so confused as to why he's not getting invaded
[4:32:41] <@Spydurman> LUL
[4:32:45] <+alphonseisbest> rip
[4:32:46] <+Grayhammatter> F
[4:32:46] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[4:32:47] <peachy996> yes.
[4:32:51] <+LandOfTheWay> so we've got the 2 fingers, and now the 3 fingers. do they combine to make a full hand?
[4:32:52] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken

[4:33:16] <%cade_calrayn> ^^
[4:33:18] <oda_flobunaga> By our Powers combined we are Chiral Man
[4:33:30] <%cade_calrayn> Dunno why the invader didn't trigger
[4:33:31] <%BinaryFireball> the invader is worth it
[4:33:39] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt said invader also has the item you need
[4:33:45] <RubberFistFight> yeah man he's supposed to thrash you back and forth across the countryside
[4:33:45] <%BinaryFireball> kinda
[4:33:46] <Zourath> @striderzer0 After falling a certain distance, double jump is disabled.
[4:33:49] <RubberFistFight> no, middle of the day
[4:34:01] <penitentpendant> @QueequegTheater Is it like the other invaders where it needs to be a specific time of day/night?
[4:34:04] <@QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[4:34:06] <dds333a> RRA
[4:34:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> RIPPPP
[4:34:08] <%BinaryFireball> if you see a ghost boy downhill of the church thats where you wanna be
[4:34:09] <tolloponik> wait the bell thing is Down What did you do?!
[4:34:12] <@Spydurman> LUL
[4:34:12] <@QueequegTheater> @penitentpendant I fought him in saytime
[4:34:13] <sothatsprettybrutal> brutal
[4:34:15] <@QueequegTheater> *daytime
[4:34:16] <+toastybites> rats can swim through salt
[4:34:19] <+Pachi3000> you thought, but rat
[4:34:21] <rosabellamelantha> it might need to be midday or something to get the invader
[4:34:26] <Ner234> Lost to a rat LUL
[4:34:27] <binku_muja_> eaten by god damn rats. again. they're weak but annoying in groups.
[4:34:28] <%Valdorick> RAtted
[4:34:31] <dds333a> The Royal Rats are back
[4:34:44] <%OrangeMDT> You know, that one item you need
[4:34:52] <Midnight188> rats cant swim but they can walk on salt so
[4:34:56] <RubberFistFight> ok so i've found a thread on reddit filled with people saying he's not invading for them, and nobody can figure out why
[4:35:06] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> has pat been to the ant cave
[4:35:07] <%OrangeMDT> I don’t even know psaLol
[4:35:08] <RubberFistFight> thread made ~9hrs ago
[4:35:18] <RubberFistFight> sorry, 2 DAYS ago
[4:35:25] <RubberFistFight> and people were still posting as of 3 hrs ago
[4:35:38] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt try setting it to mid day or something I guess
[4:35:43] <luciluxlu0> not the church
[4:35:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Talk promote procted as soon as he left lol
[4:35:44] <rosabellamelantha> i got him immediately
[4:35:50] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Have you done Hyetta's questline to the point where she asks what the grapes are?
[4:35:50] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt "attacks" is one way of putting it, yeah. "Gives you an absolute pasting" would be more accruate.
[4:35:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So is the woman who died killed by the invader
[4:35:59] <rosabellamelantha> he's in front of the church
[4:36:08] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater she's straight-up asked for the item this dude drops
[4:36:09] <rosabellamelantha> in that circle field
[4:36:18] <luciluxlu0> place to the east
[4:36:26] <@QueequegTheater> Okay then he should be here?
[4:36:28] <@QueequegTheater> WTF
[4:36:37] <RubberFistFight> he spawns on the slope up to the church
[4:36:39] <RubberFistFight> infront of the door
[4:36:40] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> pat stop looking at chat im trying to ask chat about spoilers about Ainsel River
[4:36:43] <rosabellamelantha> yeah he should have spawned by now, bugged?
[4:36:47] <%SaiyanShoto> He’s too scared of Pat
[4:36:48] <sothatsprettybrutal> strong foe not ahead
[4:36:48] <azure_dunes> yo that's a rare lily
[4:36:53] <TechnocoloredCat> maybe cause you already got the maiden blood, he wont appear
[4:37:10] <meloshav> could be that you need to beat other bosses for him to appear
[4:37:13] <RubberFistFight> @TechnocoloredCat pat had to cross the spawnpoint to get that blood
[4:37:25] <%bevyrage> if you got taunter's tongue you should be able to reset the timer
[4:37:34] <@QueequegTheater> Maybe it is midday only?
[4:37:39] <rosabellamelantha> Maybe beat rennala first?
[4:37:46] <sothatsprettybrutal> i'm seeing other people saying he won't invade for them, bug or maybe a condition people don't know about yet
[4:37:52] <%furiousfurioso> what's that spell you got
[4:37:57] <RubberFistFight> No, he invaded me before i beat renalla
[4:38:08] <meloshav> there's a lot of conditions that people probably don't know yet
[4:38:11] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha nope, it's not that, i only beat renalla last night and he first invaded me way earlier than that
[4:38:18] <%whyskeywolfe> @PatStaresAt You can get a lantern from the shop in Weeping Peninsula to have a permanent light source strapped to your belt, if you're sick of swapping in and out torches.
[4:38:19] <TechnocoloredCat> i got the eye befor rennala
[4:38:21] <Yakobro> LUL
[4:38:23] <RubberFistFight> it has to be either a bug or a quest flag
[4:38:25] <%Samuy_JP> Unfortunately I've had a lot of invasions just not trigger for me
[4:38:30] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:38:30] <+theoldone001> I stunlocked Rennala to death with the Marionette archer ashes lol
[4:38:35] <meloshav> how many runes did you have?
[4:38:38] <Grave_Titan_D> he's is the opposite of chill
[4:38:39] <+Grayhammatter> they were in fact not chill
[4:38:40] <radiorosewater> @whyskeywolfe he already did
[4:38:40] <Zourath> He did find pope, I don't know why Baeltyr's post was deleted.
[4:38:40] <%whyskeywolfe> Just a QoL thing. but a welcome one.
[4:38:41] <meloshav> Great runes I mean
[4:38:46] <%Valdorick> LUL
[4:38:48] <+nairdde> SAME
[4:38:51] <%BinaryFireball> its the best open world game to date imo
[4:38:51] <T_Sasquatch> Twitch chat never ceases to amaze people. People just have zero awareness of hot to ask questions LUL
[4:38:52] <%epide> or a light spell from ds1
[4:38:53] <sothatsprettybrutal> i would say try a restart but you've exited a couple times already not too long ago
[4:38:54] <+RedMaskBandit> The Gief wants to play..
[4:38:56] <%Valdorick> And yeah, I have no idea why that guy isn't invading.
[4:39:00] <+alphonseisbest> ITS SOOO COOL
[4:39:00] <meloshav> Pat if you love this game why haven't you been playing it that much
[4:39:01] <%whyskeywolfe> @radiorosewater ah, thanks, my b
[4:39:09] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> if he goes in the hole with all tombstones nearby power may be hiss
[4:39:15] <%twistedj3ster> I hate the combat but ithe rest is AMAZING
[4:39:21] <Midnight188> wait why is this giant man vergil?
[4:39:32] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt btw speaking of rennala it's great that you accepted Ranni's services because if you didn't do that and beat Rennala Ranni refuses to talk to you unless you absolve yourself
[4:39:34] <oda_flobunaga> Rennala is such pushover compared to everything else
[4:39:35] <radiorosewater> @whyskeywolfe no prob
[4:39:41] <+Javaa01> @RubberFistFight Did you have a Rune Arc active?
[4:39:49] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> HASSLE HOFF
[4:39:50] <+RedMaskBandit> Some giants can can cast it.
[4:39:53] <azure_dunes> yooo giant hunter???
[4:39:55] <+Grayhammatter> yo?!
[4:40:00] <meloshav> I sinned with my hand to Ranni
[4:40:06] <+nairdde> That looks sick as hell
[4:40:18] <+RedMaskBandit> TMI
[4:40:24] <ape_hawk> converted cringe tower
[4:40:25] <rosabellamelantha> Oh this puzzle is fun
[4:40:27] <meloshav> yoooooooo
[4:40:50] <rosabellamelantha> gotta go to the academy for that lol
[4:40:56] <+Kyma1020> Thops
[4:40:58] <oda_flobunaga> yep
[4:41:02] <%OrangeMDT> God just imagine what was left on the cutting room floor for this game…
[4:41:04] <tolloponik> display that you have a big brain
[4:41:09] <%BinaryFireball> i dont know how you were supposed to figure this one out
[4:41:16] <@QueequegTheater> @OrangeMDT I bet it's "nothing"
[4:41:18] <%whyskeywolfe> Zim.
[4:41:18] <%BinaryFireball> let me look it up
[4:41:19] <ape_hawk> yo mama
[4:41:19] <+nairdde> Oh Yeah I can tell you where to get the head at least
[4:41:22] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @OrangeMDT Feels lke nothing lol
[4:41:24] <+LandOfTheWay> Festering Fingerprint Vyke
[4:41:27] <meloshav> I feel like almost nothing was cut from it, just stuffed into a side dungeon and not thought out
[4:41:28] <sothatsprettybrutal> Vyke?
[4:41:29] <sirrice77> Vyke i think
[4:41:31] <@QueequegTheater> Festering Fingerprint Vyke
[4:41:31] <%cade_calrayn> Festering Fingerpint Vyke
[4:41:33] <%BinaryFireball> oh yea
[4:41:33] <%bevyrage> @OrangeMDT the floor is full of the bad poison swamps
[4:41:36] <%BinaryFireball> thats him
[4:41:43] <+RedMaskBandit> probably weird shit from GRRM. I mean have you read his books?
[4:41:44] <+alphonseisbest> One of these days From is just gonna make a game with the church of the Vagina's grace and school of the ass blaster
[4:41:49] <+alphonseisbest> i swear
[4:41:49] <@QueequegTheater> Wiki has nothing
[4:41:50] <%cade_calrayn> There's a host of comments on Fextralife saying that they can't get him to spawn
[4:41:54] <%Valdorick> The Ghost says his name... wait, did Pat talk to the ghost infront of the church?
[4:41:55] <sothatsprettybrutal> nobody knows? some people just say hey he's not here
[4:41:55] <oda_flobunaga> the devs leave a message for that puzzle that mentions erudition
[4:42:06] <penitentpendant> Elden Bugs~
[4:42:16] <Ravioli_Ronin> Try finger, but hole
[4:42:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Some use the Vaati Signal
[4:42:22] <NewWillinium> I swear Ikeep seeing something invader red to the right of that church spawn point
[4:42:26] <%cade_calrayn> Hyetta's quest doesn't appear that essential, from what I can see
[4:42:30] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> i also got fucked because the invader that drop the grape never invaded me
[4:42:30] <%OrangeMDT> Nah, they were probably had the land of reeds almost done and then were like, “let’s save it for later”
[4:42:32] <%BinaryFireball> wiki is still half empty at this point
[4:42:34] <%cade_calrayn> it ends after you get the last grape
[4:42:36] <%BinaryFireball> which is kinda cool tbh
[4:42:50] <%Brassnarwhal> reddit threads with no solutions too
[4:42:50] <meloshav> right we're still discovering stuff
[4:43:03] <SomeAsianDood> Lord of Blood seems like a chill title
[4:43:04] <sothatsprettybrutal> son of mohg
[4:43:04] <rommlll> why the blood
[4:43:15] <rosabellamelantha> you don't even need Hyetta to get the lord of frenzied flame ending she just helps you along that path
[4:43:15] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt so do you have to invade 3 times to get this guy to progress?
[4:43:16] <T_Sasquatch> Uhhhh
[4:43:20] <binku_muja_> Uhhh...no, I'm keeping my finger dude.
[4:43:22] <%Brassnarwhal> patron Mohgson
[4:43:23] <%whyskeywolfe> Is this a good idea?
[4:43:24] <%BinaryFireball> i have mixed feelings about wikis/guides for open world games like this
[4:43:30] <+alphonseisbest> ew eww ewwww
[4:43:30] <%shootbang_exe> how many invasions did you need to do to get to this point?
[4:43:36] <femto216> Yakuza
[4:43:37] <jbrachob> you bitch
[4:43:37] <sothatsprettybrutal> awesome
[4:43:37] <meloshav> this is such a detailed animation for fromsoft
[4:43:37] <T_Sasquatch> Wow they actually bothered animating it
[4:43:39] <kazadog> yo how did you get d's armour?
[4:43:40] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah, i'm seeing a lot of people confused why vyke won't invade but no answers. might actually be a bug
[4:43:42] <rosabellamelantha> Infinite invasion item
[4:43:45] <+PkSilent01> DID HE RIP A NAIL
[4:43:48] <@QueequegTheater> Varre is such an asshole I love it

[4:44:27] <%abakkus> the first thing one of my friends did when they started this game was swing on this dude LUL
[4:44:28] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you use that seal you get sent to an endgame tier optional area that has one of the STRONGEST BOSSES IN THE GAME but also +10 smithing stone, I just beat that a few hours ago
[4:44:34] <+RedMaskBandit> @vaderxyz1970 he skipped HIV?
[4:44:43] <+BoboDaHobo> wait I missed this guy, where is he??

[4:56:38] <+stellarseeker> @PatStaresAt what are the descriptions on those items you got?
[4:56:39] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> The problem isn't not getting hit. It's doing damage.

[4:56:40] <xxHungryxx> This aint yo daddies Dark Souls
[4:56:40] <+emoprawn> @PatStaresAt I genuinely believe it is impossible to do a not hit run due to some fights and mechanics

[5:04:11] <dds333a> no, just as soulless as always
[5:04:14] <joodatious> Minmaxing is super good in this game.
[5:04:15] <pi_in_the_sci> @plaguedoctor_vi If it has S scaling, what's the point of upgrading it?
[5:04:16] <%Brassnarwhal> strike smashes them otherwise they have crazy health
[5:04:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I have a new petpeeve. Hosts that don't wait for and don't even acknowledge you after the boss

[5:14:44] <%DeadRuins> @QueequegTheater it's k
[5:14:45] <tolloponik> if you don't have a library pass get the FUCK out!!!
[5:14:46] <%jamsbybetty> fuck this hobag
[5:14:47] <joodatious> magic goes hard in this game. you got pebbles and beams
[5:14:50] <sothatsprettybrutal> obviously you don't want to make it like an Ubisoft map but some sort of "oh you did this" marker would be nice maybe
[5:14:50] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I fucking hate that bitch
[5:14:51] <%RealThiele> someone got that bitch level vigor
[5:14:51] <+Nomenanza> that mage NPC just sucks to fight
[5:14:54] <%OrangeMDT> Still sub 20 vigor?
[5:14:56] <+RushUnplugged> the bow hits freaking hard
[5:14:58] <sleepystardewfarmer> Can anyone tell me, I'm still trying to learn how stats work in this game. Say I want to raise dex to max, does that mean I can't get another stat to max? Do you have a set amount of points that are spread across all stats as a whole?
[5:14:58] <%Valdorick> This fucking encounter.
[5:14:59] <%whyskeywolfe> That ant tunnel is a trip.
[5:14:59] <dds333a> the wolf head really completes it
[5:14:59] <DestroPrime83> Queequeg firing into a crowd out here
[5:15:01] <azure_dunes> I just got the spellbow myself :)
[5:15:09] <joodatious> @QueequegTheater the turtle?
[5:15:10] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You seriously might want to start levelling HP soon
[5:15:11] <majindusto> Do you have a baby coming out of your torso? lol
[5:15:11] <radiorosewater> :)
[5:15:15] <+RushUnplugged> @sleepystardewfarmer you just keep leveling
[5:15:17] <+Nomenanza> this was rough with 30 vig, good luck
[5:15:18] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater No, this NPC
[5:15:22] <pi_in_the_sci> That window in the elevator looks like something to jump towards
[5:15:24] <penitentpendant> Named NPC
[5:15:28] <%cade_calrayn> *yup*
[5:15:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Thats why @QueequegTheater is great. At least they say sorry. I got banned for finishing a song the streamer was singing in one stream cause the mods were having a bad day lol
[5:15:31] <dds333a> @destroprime83 fuck whoever gets hit LUL
[5:15:32] <+alphonseisbest> @sleepystardewfarmer no u can lv everything to max if u have the souls for it
[5:15:32] <%cade_calrayn> Miriam is fucking horribl
[5:15:32] <penitentpendant> Speaking of The Archives
[5:15:38] <iteruq> its ds3 LUL
[5:15:40] <T_Sasquatch> What do you mean games will change ?
[5:15:41] <@QueequegTheater> @TurtlesAndTentacles <3
[5:15:42] <+pectusumbra> grant us eyes and all that shit
[5:15:44] <%Buzzard42> LOL
[5:15:50] <rosabellamelantha> Achives 2
[5:15:51] <Shiibbae> Every time you say “it’s cool” it’s like your char is smiling with pride when they get healed
[5:15:54] <joodatious> the named npcs are like the hunters in bloodborn. fucking strong
[5:15:57] <dds333a> Christ, blown up quite a bit
[5:15:59] <digaogrunge> ONE SHOT
[5:16:03] <+Grayhammatter> wow, cool spell
[5:16:05] <%OrangeMDT> Oh it’s actually straight up that ds3 library
[5:16:06] <%jamsbybetty> I've gone after this slag like 20 times every few levels and still can't kill her
[5:16:09] <sleepystardewfarmer> @rushunplugged @alphonseisbest thank you!
[5:16:09] <@QueequegTheater> They've been getting lazy
[5:16:18] <%Brassnarwhal> @patstaresat you thought it was the grand archives but it's actually the ringed city
[5:16:21] <%Valdorick> @sleepystardewfarmer 1: Getting stats to max is bad, since most have harsh hard caps. 2: The limit to leveling is how much you want to grind it out. Getting to 99 in all stats might not be possible... but dex to 50 is doable!
[5:16:23] <dds333a> Tsushima side quests were fuckin awesome
[5:16:25] <%cade_calrayn> That's why Tsushima did the wind thing
[5:16:29] <%Valdorick> There's some guides on how the caps work
[5:16:37] <%Aeoneth> I'd say it's also more a case of letting your IPs breathe for a few years between releases
[5:16:37] <Heyestus> This game seems like it took a lot of effort and skill to make. So i think it will have a very negligible impact on AAA stuff @patstaresat
[5:16:42] <T_Sasquatch> @patstaresat based on how people on twitter react people really want hand holding
[5:16:43] <Midnight188> @TurtlesAndTentacles funny i get screamed at on the regular by the EC mods for the tiniest inffractions. its wild how some creators have chill atmospheres but whack moderation.
[5:16:45] <meowarco> Dragon's Dogma 2 after this game need to stack up.
[5:16:45] <+alphonseisbest> this won't also
[5:16:50] <%tetraes> no offense to Ubisoft  but i couldnt finish far cry 6 it was to dull for me lol
[5:16:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nahhhh Kappa
[5:16:59] <ALazo> I don't have time to find shit anymore, though :(
[5:17:04] <+alphonseisbest> Nothing will change UBISOFT TEIR  SHIT
[5:17:05] <rosabellamelantha> yeah don't let that guy get off a melee cast
[5:17:07] <tolloponik> breath of the wild was more of a level design thing with slight game play persuasion
[5:17:07] <dds333a> Big Hat camping
[5:17:10] <rosabellamelantha> he will SHRED you
[5:17:16] <Ner234> Oh god I just thought of something. What if this game has NG+ exclusive content/items?
[5:17:16] <joodatious> Dragons Dogma 2 just needs to be Dragons Dogma but more lmao
[5:17:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Everyone just focused on the traversal and scale for botw
[5:17:22] <sleepystardewfarmer> @valdorick Thanks!
[5:17:23] <tolloponik> this good god what this game will do to the industry
[5:17:27] <WillSin4Cash> this mage man is a prick
[5:17:27] <sirrice77> wow pats destroying this one
[5:17:29] <17sevens> no pat if we don't force the player to see all the ai generated content why would we even develop it
[5:17:30] <%Valdorick> @meowarco "Fuck it! We made it Elden Ring, but with DM5C combat."
[5:17:32] <+Pachi3000> up
[5:17:36] <rosabellamelantha> No
[5:17:40] <rosabellamelantha> upstairs
[5:17:40] <T_Sasquatch> I can't blame game devs for making open world games checklists that tell you everything when the average player is potentially braindead LUL
[5:17:42] <%Brassnarwhal> look at all these ghost archers better kill the guy summoning them at the end of this bridge
[5:17:45] <+alphonseisbest> @ALazo yes, u do, just pick at it when u have the time
[5:17:49] <%DashXero> Just like the Grand Archives.

[5:21:58] <sothatsprettybrutal> i dunno about Elden Ring changing the landscape... it's not like Dark Souls _really_ did, people copied some mechanics and obviously there were a few games/series that really leaned into it but.... if anything elden ring is Fromsoft moving to where the market is
[5:21:59] <xxHungryxx> Finish her with opitc blast
[5:22:05] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Nice

[5:22:32] <penitentpendant> Lightning Resistant Rats
[5:22:32] <peachy996> Now it's Bloodborne

[5:24:57] <@QueequegTheater> @Broand Sometimes
[5:25:07] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt you need to get a statue from Ranni to put on the altar at the start
[5:25:07] <RyuuAoi> He tried
[5:25:11] <%cade_calrayn> it's part of her quest
[5:25:11] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> its a quest thing
[5:25:12] <%Broand> huh
[5:25:12] <dds333a> huh
[5:25:14] <joodatious> yeah i think its a rune tower thing
[5:25:16] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt no you have to progress with ranni's quest
[5:25:16] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I think you have to beat the THIRD shardbearer
[5:25:16] <joodatious> u need rune
[5:25:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> correct, but it's not this area's boss that progresses this
[5:25:21] <%Brassnarwhal> @ziggy_1031 pre second boss
[5:25:23] <manoshake> you have to initiate a wuest after the 2nd boss
[5:25:23] <%epide> nope i think its a story thing
[5:25:28] <penitentpendant> At least the NPC is out of the way
[5:25:37] <Ner234> Still jamming
[5:25:39] <+laserchainsaws> It’s a boss in a different area
[5:25:41] <manoshake> it's a quest after the boss
[5:25:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Time for college or ants

[5:26:21] <roguemephilesclone> Knowing what this major boss is, you should err on the side of helping Ranni now.
[5:26:24] <@QueequegTheater> to defend mother earth from any alien attack
[5:26:25] <+alphonseisbest> edf

[5:26:43] <xxHungryxx> Bugs Life
[5:26:45] <%Monkeyweed21> TO SAVE OUR MOTHER EARTH FROM ANY ALIEN ATTACK
[5:26:48] <@QueequegTheater> You're honestly overlevelled for the second zone at this point
[5:26:54] <plaguedoctor_vi> EDF, EDF, EDF, EDF
[5:26:58] <%Brassnarwhal> rune 3 is a good sign
[5:26:58] <DerpioParty> ANTS

[5:26:59] <sirrice77> the ants hit hard but thats all
[5:27:02] <rottingpastry> dargon
[5:27:02] <SomeAsianDood> they don't seem that bad
[5:27:04] <roguemephilesclone> Burn ants with magnifying glass.
[5:27:05] <+hoenhime344> ok that was cool
[5:27:06] <rosabellamelantha> I didn't have any trouble with the ants
[5:27:08] <%Chex868> mat u have no idea there is so m,uch faith shit in end game
[5:27:09] <%MoaLaMoa> i don't know what to focus on yet, just started but really feeling halberds so far
[5:27:18] <manoshake> ants apparently can't take fire
[5:27:20] <%whyskeywolfe> @QueequegTheater His low health is offsetting that a lil bit.
[5:27:20] <tolloponik> X8?!
[5:27:20] <mar_krow> Faith spells so cool I love it
[5:27:21] <Happydisaster> Ant on cealing
[5:27:23] <+IxDomxI> from vicious giant insects who have once again come back
[5:27:24] <muerphy> Audio is loww T
[5:27:24] <%DashXero> Oh goddammit. Why'd it have to be ANTS?!
[5:27:26] <RyuuAoi> They are weak
[5:27:29] <sothatsprettybrutal> on the invasion guy that's not spawning: there's a "let people invade me even if i'm not using co op" item right? even though he's an npc, maybe?
[5:27:30] <+RedMaskBandit> don't say that, then they'll nerf it.
[5:27:32] <%barkon345> wait is he still in the first zone?
[5:27:33] <rottingpastry> ant poo
[5:27:33] <KasiCrafter> Wait. Grace Mimic. Does that mean...you can become an ant??
[5:27:41] <%RealThiele> many ants
[5:27:42] <Midnight188> Ants. Ants. We're the Ants...
[5:27:43] <%DashXero> I fuckin' hate ants.
[5:27:44] <dds333a> By the way, I feel very vindicated since I always run Faith
[5:27:46] <%MoaLaMoa> i for one welcome our ant overlords
[5:27:49] <RyuuAoi> But they travel in packs
[5:27:53] <monzy101> EDF!!!
[5:27:56] <penitentpendant> @KasiCrafter Nope, it's a common item
[5:28:02] <manoshake> ants are glass cannons
[5:28:03] <rosabellamelantha> Pat you really need to start pumping vig
[5:28:05] <roguemephilesclone> Boy. This is awful! I don't like this!
[5:28:08] <tolloponik> what dose brown mean now that corrosion is gone?
[5:28:10] <xxHungryxx> Everything huerts in this
[5:28:13] <+Grayhammatter> EDF! EDF! EDF!
[5:28:13] <%whyskeywolfe> @barkon345 No this is the second zone
[5:28:16] <@QueequegTheater> @tolloponik poo
[5:28:17] <roguemephilesclone> BUH
[5:28:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Has from done ants before? Feels like it's mostly spiders and centipedes with them
[5:28:19] <%whyskeywolfe> Sssssorta
[5:28:23] <%Brassnarwhal> who could have foreseen the ants using swarm tactics
[5:28:24] <Dopamien> glass cannon build forever
[5:28:26] <+aaymon86> Is running hybrid faith better than Pure Faith?
[5:28:28] <joodatious> its better to be over leveled for the academy honestly so you can enjoy it better. the shardbearer boss isn't especially hard but it sure is cool and atmospheric
[5:28:29] <+alphonseisbest> NOOOOOOOOO
[5:28:30] <manoshake> EDFFFFF
[5:28:32] <+alphonseisbest> FUCK THAT
[5:28:32] <%Kevlar_Caviar> if he doesn't pump vigor soon he's gonna have a REAL bad time
[5:28:33] <%MoaLaMoa> i believe in the Goosebumps theory that our planet is secretly a human version of an ant farm, for galactic ants
[5:28:34] <%gitgouda> kaiju?
[5:28:35] <%whyskeywolfe> Love dat Ant Juice
[5:28:39] <+alphonseisbest> THEYCOME OUTTA THE GROUND
[5:28:41] <RyuuAoi> This could be bad
[5:28:42] <Heyestus> Do these respawn infinitely?
[5:28:43] <rottingpastry> leave now zombie ants!
[5:28:45] <mar_krow> Oh shit I was fine with giant spider why did get a tingle from seeing an ant
[5:28:46] <dds333a> @hunk_of_dunk they've even tackled centipedes more often than Ants
[5:28:48] <stormhawk9891> COFFIN ANTS
[5:28:51] <joodatious> eww
[5:28:51] <+Local16> Got the frenzy invader and boy hes an ass but he drops neat stuff
[5:28:52] <roguemephilesclone> If this was Dark Souls 2, that acid would break your armor.
[5:28:54] <%DashXero> Body snatcher ants.
[5:28:59] <%Brassnarwhal> I'm still at 15 and i beat college
[5:28:59] <%RealThiele> they love tasty corpses
[5:29:00] <%Felhad> Felhad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hi Pat, you're Pat! All I wanna say is Elden Ring kicks all the ass, including my own.
[5:29:00] <Grave_Titan_D> this is how we get ant lana
[5:29:01] <@QueequegTheater> Ants gotta eat
[5:29:05] <rosabellamelantha> Free meat
[5:29:09] <+pectusumbra> stockpiling meat it looks like
[5:29:11] <+Grayhammatter> we got some body snatchers
[5:29:12] <rottingpastry> if this was dark souls 2, it would be a worse game
[5:29:17] <@QueequegTheater> Dude I love the anchor
[5:29:17] <rosabellamelantha> dude ants will eat ANYTHING
[5:29:17] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> You'd think from would do ants more than they do considering they're one of the most populous insects on earth
[5:29:19] <SpookyMooks> tryna get the yummy dead folks
[5:29:20] <mar_krow> This is very nito
[5:29:21] <xxHungryxx> Rot Antz

[5:29:36] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> PHAT ant
[5:29:39] <%ElkRiverDog> To the ants it's probably like finding a pistachio

[5:30:33] <joodatious> it makes all the past games previous dragon powers look so awful
[5:30:33] <+hoenhime344> its like... an actual dragon breath
[5:30:36] <+goblinking92> they both meet
[5:30:37] <@QueequegTheater> pickle Kreygasm
[5:30:40] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> if an ant queen isn't the boss of the ant dungeon, what the fuck is?
[5:30:41] <+RedMaskBandit> the ants should go berserk when their queen dies, right?
[5:30:42] <@MistyMntns> Time For Pickle
[5:30:49] <roguemephilesclone> That egg is a yikes of an envi-ron-mental storytelling.
[5:30:49] <jmft2000> yes
[5:30:51] <@QueequegTheater> @Hunk_Of_Dunk don't worry about it Kappa
[5:30:54] <+Grayhammatter> imagine an actual dragon breath
[5:30:58] <mar_krow> Poor liquid metal into ant holes
[5:31:00] <joodatious> this looks cool

[5:31:12] <rosabellamelantha> both sides are progress
[5:31:12] <%Felhad> No spoilers, but man the third demigod is kicking my ass, feels super bad on a melee build
[5:31:12] <%cade_calrayn> there's a map here soon
[5:31:12] <Giztech> both go to same place
[5:31:14] <%Puhff> LUL
[5:31:14] <@MistyMntns> Go Forward!
[5:31:15] <dds333a> @marlborored5 make beautiful art
[5:31:17] <xxHungryxx> @Hunk_Of_Dunk The Ant King of course
[5:31:18] <joodatious> it really is just the dragon breath ability in Divinity Original sin 2 lol
[5:31:19] <fierysnowflakes> TWO WAYS FORWARD, ONE WAY BACK
[5:31:19] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @Hunk_Of_Dunk scariest possible answer, thank you queequeg
[5:31:21] <joodatious> love it
[5:31:22] <peachy996> Left Progress or Right Progress
[5:31:23] <TheNix> The more I see of this game, the more I think that the way forward is every direction
[5:31:23] <%Puhff> this game
[5:31:24] <+RedMaskBandit> imagine the smell
[5:31:24] <UnImprest> they meet. other way has item
[5:31:25] <+Grayhammatter> that does seem like the wat forward
[5:31:25] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Everyway is forward on this game
[5:31:28] <jmft2000> grace ahead
[5:31:31] <RyuuAoi> Every way is the way forward
[5:31:34] <%Brassnarwhal> backtrack your backtrack
[5:31:34] <sothatsprettybrutal> you'd best start believin in the critical path
[5:31:35] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[5:31:35] <@QueequegTheater> touch grace
[5:31:35] <Heyestus> This kinda reminds me of going under the well in Dragon's Dogma
[5:31:38] <+RedMaskBandit> it's just the underground.
[5:31:42] <+Nomenanza> it is so huge dude it's insane
[5:31:48] <joodatious> lots of time and hardwork
[5:31:49] <ape_hawk> 5 years of dev time does a lot
[5:31:51] <%whyskeywolfe> Hold that thought
[5:31:51] <T_Sasquatch> Its like skyrim with guns Kappa
[5:31:51] <dds333a> but you haven't finished it yet Kappa
[5:31:52] <SirItGoBoomAlot> money
[5:31:53] <+alphonseisbest> DK
[5:31:54] <+alphonseisbest> AGIC
[5:31:56] <manoshake> passion and sweat
[5:31:57] <%epide> lol skills and dedication
[5:31:57] <Khester824> has pat figured out how to use the great rune he got from killding godfrick?
[5:31:58] <+alphonseisbest> MAGIC
[5:31:58] <Parapattern> It's called talent
[5:31:58] <%RealThiele> how will Fromsoft ever release another souls game this sets a high bar
[5:31:59] <penitentpendant> They've had years of practice
[5:31:59] <sirrice77> @Felhad try using a ash of war that does ranged attacks such as stormwind blade or spectral spear
[5:31:59] <mar_krow> Not wrong
[5:32:00] <%twistedj3ster> it might be the most impressive game I've seen in decades
[5:32:02] <+alphonseisbest> BLUUUD
[5:32:02] <rosabellamelantha> the underground is legit my favourite part of the game
[5:32:02] <+theoldone001> Miyazaki runs a tight ship. dude's good at what he does.
[5:32:04] <%Brassnarwhal> yes
[5:32:05] <%gitgouda> dont you want another useless mask?
[5:32:07] <manoshake> it's like Skyrim souls
[5:32:07] <+Nomenanza> I've explored so much out of the world without even killing Godrik
[5:32:09] <+ithonmage> It's not big enough
[5:32:09] <rosabellamelantha> I LOVE the underground in elden ring
[5:32:10] <joodatious> like skyrim but with level design
[5:32:11] <Giztech> the other path takes you on top of that stone archway
[5:32:11] <+alphonseisbest> ALL HANDS ON DECK
[5:32:11] <+RedMaskBandit> the black reach.
[5:32:12] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It feels the Elden Ring is the original ambition of DS2, fully realized
[5:32:14] <%Broand> Oh wait that said River
[5:32:15] <sleepystardewfarmer> don't jinx it
[5:32:17] <dds333a> The caves in skyrim were fucking ass LUL
[5:32:18] <+alphonseisbest> ELDER SCROLLS 6 IS FUCKED
[5:32:18] <+tizziks> huge amounts of crunch?
[5:32:23] <%Brassnarwhal> you just havent found the dragon asses yet pat
[5:32:25] <+TDotGoat> they couldn't finish DS1 because they were busy working on this
[5:32:25] <T_Sasquatch> Can you imagine an open world bloodnorner
[5:32:26] <sothatsprettybrutal> what Elden Ring needs is radiant quests
[5:32:29] <dds333a> Either fucked beyond belief, or just boring
[5:32:31] <%sniffy77> I bet they are able to disguise reused assets really well to help them with the dev
[5:32:31] <ErikFeral> bethesda just sucks
[5:32:35] <RyuuAoi> I bet the end will be a flaccid penis.
[5:32:36] <+pectusumbra> well if we go off the DS formula, the last 25/30% of the game usually shits the bed in some way, so give it like another 30 hours and let's see?
[5:32:36] <plaguedoctor_vi> Well i think GRRM though about the story together with Miazaki and the team could focus on the level desing and gameplay
[5:32:37] <T_Sasquatch> Bloodborne*
[5:32:41] <+emoprawn> @PatStaresAt I'm two endings away from getting platinum, and can confirm it stays amasing throughout, though there is some copypasting
[5:32:44] <SpookyMooks> also that this is their real first open world game and it's this good
[5:32:47] <%gitgouda> @alphonseisbest elder scrolls 6? you mean skyrims rere re re re re rerelease?
[5:32:48] <Ravioli_Ronin> I honestly don’t know how they’re gonna top this one if they make anymore souls likes after this
[5:32:50] <+Nomenanza> @QueequegTheater Yeah. It does feel like it when you take note of some areas and their structure
[5:32:54] <Saltmeisterr> @T_Sasquatch bloodnorne*
[5:32:56] <+RedMaskBandit> the Bloody Palace is technically "down" here as well.
[5:32:58] <@QueequegTheater> @pectusumbra According to people who've finished it, it doesn't
[5:33:06] <T_Sasquatch> Bloodboner
[5:33:08] <+theoldone001> Imagine if Miyazaki played Dragons Dogma and said I can do that but better
[5:33:08] <%whyskeywolfe> You're really gonna want to start pumping Vigor soon.
[5:33:12] <%sighphers> does fromsoftware suffer/crunch when making these games?
[5:33:15] <@QueequegTheater> @Nomenanza Tanimura is co-director, for what it's worth
[5:33:16] <fierysnowflakes> Decide you monkey man!
[5:33:17] <manoshake> Can't wait until they tackle every genre and make masterpieces in each one.
[5:33:19] <%tetraes> Imagine if Bloodborne 2 had this level of scale
[5:33:21] <joodatious> @PatStaresAt would you say that Elden Ring being as good as it is was worth the Game of Thrones books not being finished?
[5:33:23] <Giztech> down there pops out on the left on a cliff
[5:33:27] <sothatsprettybrutal> still, with copy-pasting. it's not like Skyrim doesn't have copy-pasting
[5:33:28] <dds333a> @ravioli_ronin I feel like they won't try, and just do some more regular fare leading up to another big one like this
[5:33:28] <rosabellamelantha> it comes out on those left clifffaces you can see over there
[5:33:29] <%cade_calrayn> has your map loaded in, Pat?

[5:34:09] <+RedMaskBandit> there's never been a reported case of crunch but wasn't DS2 pushed back? or was that just Scholar of the first sin?

[5:37:17] <+zaddyforever> elden ring addiction turns you into a tarnished irl
[5:37:18] <%DashXero> If I killed Patches while he was a boss, does that count as a sin?

[5:37:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> LUL I LOVE IT. Pat has the best reactions
[5:37:31] <@QueequegTheater> @DashXero I think so
[5:37:32] <+SaintSalted> wtf
[5:37:36] <+RedMaskBandit> yeah but isn't Japan known for their laws regarding work place shenagians like crunch?
[5:37:39] <jmft2000> go left
[5:37:41] <DestroPrime83> BEHOLD! THE INFINITE MALIGNITY OF THE STARS!
[5:37:41] <joodatious> i wanna go back to Antz
[5:37:42] <Giztech> go other way for save point
[5:37:44] <tolloponik> the house centipede they told you not to worry about
[5:37:46] <%whyskeywolfe> You ain't know the half of it.
[5:37:48] <RyuuAoi> That thang ain't ova
[5:37:52] <dds333a> The Living Failures summon LUL
[5:37:52] <ziggy_1031> @RedMaskBandit no lol
[5:37:54] <%DashXero> @QueequegTheater Awwww... But it's Patches....
[5:37:54] <+Grayhammatter> that ain't no ant
[5:38:01] <majindusto> THAT'S...AN...ALIIIIIIIIIIIEN!!!!
[5:38:02] <+imthewisejanitor> Starting to think that people will literally look at anything and think "That's a bloodborne."
[5:38:04] <+tizziks> Japan is known for people working themselves to death
[5:38:05] <jmft2000> there is a grace there
[5:38:09] <manoshake> you just found the twist of the game, it's about aliuns
[5:38:09] <@QueequegTheater> @DashXero And you know you shouldn't kill him
[5:38:12] <joodatious> @RedMaskBandit i mean they just don't get legal about it but you still have employees being pushed to crunch
[5:38:12] <sothatsprettybrutal> i mean if you want to talk stereotypically, japan is known for overwork
[5:38:18] <RyuuAoi> Guess you gotta kill it
[5:38:18] <%whyskeywolfe> That thing is optional btw
[5:38:23] <+RushUnplugged> in Japan the problem is less crunch and more a culture of overworking
[5:38:25] <joodatious> lmao
[5:38:26] <+SaintSalted> but thats like really a bloodborne tho
[5:38:27] <Giztech> that bug is optional
[5:38:29] <tolloponik> @RedMaskBandit tell that to the anime Industry
[5:38:32] <%tetraes> oh man cant believe that this cave started with ants lol
[5:38:34] <%whyskeywolfe> This direction is progress.
[5:38:34] <valstriam> @redmaskbandit isn't it the opposite? they have "black companies" and all
[5:38:34] <%DashXero> @QueequegTheater But he's such a jerk!
[5:38:37] <dds333a> good old homie ants
[5:38:40] <plaguedoctor_vi> @RedMaskBandit it a actually society expectation to crunch
[5:38:42] <majindusto> Thank god...Ants
[5:38:45] <ziggy_1031> they're like honey ants! only with meat :)
[5:38:49] <%cade_calrayn> that's a *SPACE* Bloodborne
[5:38:49] <joodatious> I mean overworking like that is just culture supported crunch
[5:38:50] <%bruuzer12> @patstaresat I got invaded by Vyke at Bellum, I may have figured out why people couldn't get him to invade
[5:38:54] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt you might want to kill that dude now cus this area does loop around
[5:38:56] <%whyskeywolfe> Go up the left there.
[5:38:56] <@QueequegTheater> @DashXero You broke into his cave and stole his clothes
[5:39:02] <+ithonmage> I can now imagine fromsoft making an EDF game
[5:39:03] <+Ravenian96> New Earth Defence Force looks dope
[5:39:18] <%Mister_McDerp> covid vaccine horn
[5:39:18] <dds333a> tell us
[5:39:22] <+badhaye> turn around
[5:39:25] <CptHarlok> EDF always looks dope
[5:39:27] <%DashXero> He wouldn't let me leave without stealing his clothes.
[5:39:27] <@MistyMntns> My question is why are all the ants trying to cosplay as Leeloo Dallas
[5:39:33] <+OrangeMDT> How many orphans (that don’t got no parents) did From have to sacrifice for this?
[5:39:35] <+TheBitingIrish> He just said, yea?
[5:39:37] <sothatsprettybrutal> muultipass
[5:39:43] <dds333a> @mistymntns LUL LUL
[5:39:44] <joodatious> ants cant be understood
[5:39:49] <%whyskeywolfe> @MistyMntns Cos they got taste.
[5:39:53] <%bruuzer12> @patstaresat because he doesn't invade by the church. There's another area, higher up where he pops up
[5:39:54] <+badhaye> theres a spoit you missed by theants
[5:40:02] <plaguedoctor_vi> @OrangeMDT all of them
[5:40:07] <%bruuzer12> He could invade by both, im not sure

[5:40:28] <%Mister_McDerp> he doesn't know how to leave LUL

[5:40:32] <%JoshManVGH> God damn it!
[5:40:36] <%cade_calrayn> No, Pat, those are cliffs that you can't climb
[5:40:37] <luciluxlu0> I think that spawning at the church stops hin invade
[5:40:38] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> so close to it
[5:40:38] <%JoshManVGH> The game keeps growing!
[5:40:40] <+Grayhammatter> wow, wtf is this map?
[5:40:41] <plaguedoctor_vi> @OrangeMDT and it was worth it, because they got no parents anyway
[5:40:50] <%cade_calrayn> those are paths you can only go down, not up
[5:40:50] <@QueequegTheater> He doesn't have eyes pat
[5:40:52] <%DashXero> No rent and no taxes. Perfect place to live.
[5:40:54] <%epide> this game messes with my head
[5:40:56] <+Local16> @bruuzer12 He invaded my in the area before the church and spawned on the walkway up lol

[5:41:04] <%DashXero> Who's gonna collect?
[5:41:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Every single one of my crashes has been in related to me being summoned. Guys, I think the Networking isn't very good

[5:41:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> PC
[5:41:48] <manoshake> you get a ton of celestial dew for free later
[5:41:50] <sothatsprettybrutal> or am i wrong on that
[5:41:52] <%nanaki_ff14> can we tell you?
[5:41:52] <ziggy_1031> this guy set up shop before that thing got there and now he''s stuck LUL
[5:41:53] <+pectusumbra> can you target it?
[5:41:56] <%nanaki_ff14> where to go
[5:42:06] <+badhaye> go back to da ants
[5:42:07] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you want to get up to that guy go that that last bonfire and go right following the river like the map shows
[5:42:11] <+goblinking92> go back a room.  look for the path to the right
[5:42:11] <digaogrunge> follow the river path in the previous cave
[5:42:12] <+matf8> his shop gets a ton of foot traffic though
[5:42:15] <+badhaye> or beat this guy up
[5:42:17] <%cade_calrayn> There *is* a way up there
[5:42:27] <rosabellamelantha> no the other one
[5:42:30] <+pectusumbra> so you have to find a way up to cinematic kill it
[5:42:32] <+alphonseisbest> @wizard_of_diamonds ah, might just be the port, From's PC ports are always fucked on release, ps4 invading works no problem
[5:42:35] <%cade_calrayn> Wrong way
[5:42:37] <dds333a> Absolutely
[5:42:37] <%epide> if you use the other path you can fight it close up
[5:42:48] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, follow the pillar
[5:42:50] <%Dakuu75> had to change a noisy fan in my PC... "Finally... inner peace."
[5:42:54] <@QueequegTheater> Set it to Wumbo
[5:43:17] <+hoenhime344> is that armor from the deathbed companion?

[5:56:53] <%bruuzer12> Chat, when Pat was looking for Vyke, did he make it all the way to the Church of Inhibition? I may have given him bad info
[5:57:02] <+alphonseisbest> @megaman_sentinel WAS FAITH EVEN IN BLOODBORNE?
[5:57:08] <Giztech> hits on the first attack and with the wave after
[5:57:12] <BattlexQueen> Was that a faith spell i didnt see
[5:57:14] <milkandcreamer> does the beastclaw talisman let you double dip strength+faith or does it just replace faith scaling with strength?
[5:57:15] <dds333a> @alphonseisbest Arcane Kappa
[5:57:16] <%RealThiele> @bruuzer12 yes he went there
[5:57:18] <@QueequegTheater> @megaman_sentinel exactly

[5:57:34] <%cascadepersona> @alphonseisbest No faith, only Arcane and Bullets
[5:57:46] <%Dakuu75> Metal
[5:57:53] <%nanaki_ff14> group them up
[5:57:53] <%DanThePumpkinman> always loved the idea that if you believed in something hard enough you can throw lightning lmao
[5:57:57] <dds333a> you didn't have to do him like that, Pat
[5:57:59] <%bruuzer12> damn, my bad then. I didn't go the same way he did, I found a bullshit alternative

[6:04:25] <dds333a> @femto216 oh, is that so? LUL
[6:04:30] <%Insom62> this is literally just bloodborne
[6:04:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> that lift is cool as fuck
[6:04:36] <+xerj> Lucaria and Sharlayan have burgers, confirmed

[6:04:42] <xxHungryxx> Watching Pat stream and eating Fig Newtons SeemsGood
[6:04:48] <joodatious> you guys think everything is bloodborn lol

[6:05:06] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Grace mimic is an item???
[6:05:08] <joodatious> tombstones? this is totally bloodborn
[6:05:10] <@QueequegTheater> stole your magic juice
[6:05:12] <rosabellamelantha> a tiny detail with that that I don't think they ever go into is Sellen's is based off her and not that dude because she's arrogant as hell
[6:05:20] <rosabellamelantha> it's great characterization
[6:05:20] <%slrls_> This place wasn't great as a pure mage. It seemed like everything has high magic resistance.
[6:05:26] <+thesw1tch> @joodatious this is pretty bloodborne tho
[6:05:29] <mar_krow> I wanna see pat stats
[6:05:34] <bassoontyphoon> Grace mimic??!?
[6:05:37] <%Dakuu75> Does mashing R2 and L2 help, during grabs?
[6:05:39] <Frranky> heavy risk, but the prize...
[6:05:43] <rosabellamelantha> this place had BIG rewards for my spellsword
[6:05:44] <+Ravenian96> Why are there anti-magic zombies in the mage academy graveyard?
[6:05:45] <+alphonseisbest> yup
[6:05:46] <%slrls_> Maybe one day when my character is smarter
[6:05:47] <digaogrunge> There was an "Iron Virgin" at the bottom of the here, I think Patches said
[6:05:48] <plaguedoctor_vi> i did just fine here
[6:05:50] <+LandOfTheWay> there are some insanely strong spells for pure mages
[6:05:51] <dds333a> these guys don't just want a penny for your thoughts, they want the whole damn wallet
[6:05:52] <@QueequegTheater> @Frranky ugh
[6:05:56] <+badhaye> it absolutely does. go full glass cannon
[6:06:05] <+zaddyforever> so many illusory walls
[6:06:06] <neet98> this is the mage power spike area

[6:06:26] <%bruuzer12> bruuzer12 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Hey Pat, glad to see you're liking Elden Ring as much as I am. Also, I gave you some bad info on Vyke, seeing as I reached the same place you did through a bullshit horse-shortcut that bypassed the lift south of it. Sorry about that man, go fry some fuckers with lightning and or magma
[6:06:29] <%RealThiele> nom
[6:06:30] <rosabellamelantha> I just skipped these dudes after a while
[6:06:34] <joodatious> i think these guys respawn
[6:06:38] <CptHarlok> It wasn't particularly good for a pure phys build... I killed shit easy sure, but those ranged mages were a headache.
[6:06:49] <AthenaAegis> HUSKS in a SOULS game WutFace
[6:06:52] <+LandOfTheWay> when i finally have the cash for a copy of my own i plan on doing a strength build based on Raoh
[6:07:04] <joodatious> nice jump
[6:07:09] <dds333a> Reapers up to their bullshit NotLikeThis
[6:07:26] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt That ash does fucking WORK on melee builds btw
[6:07:27] <%Dakuu75> oooh~ I wanna summon these manaquin bros
[6:07:28] <manoshake> that was pretty good
[6:07:42] <joodatious> i thought summons was gonna be a half baked mechanic but im happy to see its actually useful and have alot of summons
[6:07:46] <+Nomenanza> mages doing creepy experimental shit? fits the BB like a glove
[6:07:46] <+Saggitori> blood porn
[6:07:47] <majindusto> THAT'S  A BLOODBORNE
[6:07:47] <fierysnowflakes> Feels more Dark Souls 3 to me than Bloodborne
[6:07:48] <+twdlrr> Hemwick charnel lane
[6:07:49] <Frranky> dogs
[6:07:51] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, I just got the game today after UPS delivered my package to the wrong house :I  Just got the Great Epee and I'm having a blast but fuck those imps in the early game dungeons
[6:07:55] <iteruq> dogs
[6:07:55] <Parapattern> They got the gravestones and everything
[6:07:55] <TheNix> yeah that reminds me of bloodborne all right
[6:07:56] <+RedKazoo> Cant believe Elden Ring is Bloodborne 2
[6:07:56] <XxMoliciousxX> why are you in the hunter's dream?
[6:07:57] <manoshake> jesus
[6:07:58] <sothatsprettybrutal> sorry oleg
[6:07:58] <joodatious> pat i feel you just might be obsessed with bloodborn
[6:07:58] <+eanscrale> I wonder if there's bloodborne weapons here
[6:07:59] <dds333a> Yum
[6:08:00] <+NeonFishFace> gang banged
[6:08:01] <peachy996> a lil more ds3
[6:08:03] <$thomassolorio> lighnin gtime

[6:08:07] <majindusto> BLOODBORNE  2...IN ELDEN RING
[6:08:10] <+zaddyforever> i got tired of this graveyard after one deatg and just sprinted through
[6:08:11] <RyuuAoi> That area real
[6:08:11] <+Grayhammatter> gangbanged
[6:08:12] <manoshake> Raya has a zombie problem
[6:08:14] <%cascadepersona> Those really are just the gravestones from the Hunter's dream
[6:08:14] <joodatious> "this is bloodborn" is the new is this anor londo
[6:08:14] <+Ravenian96> this area is a bloodborne tho
[6:08:15] <tolloponik> based off of that giant head thing this is pretty close to the bull shit they are up to only worse
[6:08:16] <mar_krow> Pat the duel scythe holy grim reaper
[6:08:17] <@QueequegTheater> If anyone here is running pure melee, GET THOSE MARIONETTES
[6:08:17] <%cade_calrayn> ELMO BUTT

[6:08:23] <%cade_calrayn> BEHOLD THE ELMO BUTT
[6:08:24] <xxHungryxx> Elmo
[6:08:24] <neet98> byrgenwerth but longer
[6:08:25] <therealritzreal> more like RE lol
[6:08:25] <%Brassnarwhal> what if the cathedral of the deep was painted like bloodborne
[6:08:27] <%topendbuzza> BB HAS GUNS THO
[6:08:28] <dds333a> BB is the coolest
[6:08:33] <RyuuAoi> It's like Bloodborne phase 2 in there.
[6:08:40] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt pat you know that grave the zombies were worshipping on the graveyard? go behind that for RAD armour
[6:08:41] <%watts121> I'm 80 hours in and Elden Ring has surpassed BB to me. It's insane how much content there is.
[6:08:43] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's also DS 2: 2
[6:08:44] <joodatious> this is a much better byrgenwerth
[6:08:48] <dds333a> I have always loved BB over DS's medieval fantasy
[6:08:51] <%gitgouda> YEEEEES
[6:08:52] <bassoontyphoon> Is being obseesed with bb a bad thing?
[6:08:54] <%topendbuzza> disco?
[6:09:01] <+HexLotus> All we need is a pizza cutter and a side step
[6:09:01] <+Ravenian96> Elden Ring has me eating good tbh
[6:09:04] <%cascadepersona> BB is so cool with such terrible technical aspects
[6:09:05] <+tizziks> SPider-man?
[6:09:06] <%sniffy77> those dogs are bitches
[6:09:06] <joodatious> Disco
[6:09:07] <%discoinfierno> Yeah the best parts of the souls games is when they're weird, and that's the BB specialty
[6:09:08] <$HunterWalker23> play older titles
[6:09:09] <iteruq> god of war?
[6:09:10] <%topendbuzza> yes
[6:09:15] <MilletDumplings> Hades
[6:09:15] <%cascadepersona> Endwalker
[6:09:16] <radiorosewater> Disco
[6:09:16] <AgnusLaplace> disco good but incredibly niche
[6:09:18] <peachy996> Eh this ain't for me
[6:09:18] <digaogrunge> Some people dont like fantasy, they prefer Bloodborne cause GUNS and BLOOD
[6:09:18] <tolloponik> yeah
[6:09:19] <xDartuzax> I feel exactly that way
[6:09:19] <Parapattern> Disco is too nitche
[6:09:19] <Heyestus> Universal acclaim has been lacking of late.
[6:09:20] <$thomassolorio> yes
[6:09:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> I feel like Disco is a little niche to be that
[6:09:23] <+Ravenian96> I'm sad I'm almost finished with it for real
[6:09:23] <T_Sasquatch> I play old video games so i don't care LUL im still going through ps2 and ps3 era
[6:09:24] <plaguedoctor_vi> yes a darling for everyone
[6:09:24] <RyuuAoi> Yeah BOTW
[6:09:24] <joodatious> isn't that just more hype then anything?
[6:09:26] <%HRDSalami654> Disco's good, but NOT on Switch.
[6:09:27] <peachy996> But I'll watch you nerds play it
[6:09:28] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> hold on my sword broke, gotta open a weapon menu
[6:09:28] <rosabellamelantha> I may be biased mind you but the Carian set is amazing for me
[6:09:29] <TheNix> Hades but it wasnt as mainstream
[6:09:29] <%tetraes> Ghost of Tsushima
[6:09:29] <+ithonmage> you mean last of us 2 wasn't a masterpiece (sarcasm)
[6:09:31] <+tizziks> A tentpole release.  generation defining
[6:09:33] <$HunterWalker23> shadow warrior 3 overlooked entirely
[6:09:34] <%HRDSalami654> God it's bad on Switch.
[6:09:35] <@MistyMntns> Now I know why I havent been playing video games for a while.
[6:09:35] <projecthazoid> Hades?
[6:09:36] <mar_krow> Pokémon violet
[6:09:36] <RyuuAoi> Not everyone played disco
[6:09:40] <xxHungryxx> some ppl still gripped about BotW tho
[6:09:41] <+HexLotus> *except plague of gripes
[6:09:41] <rosabellamelantha> Pat armour on the right
[6:09:45] <%Aeoneth> I just finished reclearing with my FF14 raiding with my static and we flubbed a bunch of mechanics cuz we had Elden Ring on the brain
[6:09:45] <manoshake> this game is an achievement is open world design and pushes the medium forward
[6:09:46] <bassoontyphoon> Like 10s across the boards
[6:09:47] <+I4gotmyname89> FF14?
[6:09:51] <XxMoliciousxX> pokemon go?
[6:09:52] <@MistyMntns> That is why I am *devouring* Earthbound.
[6:09:55] <%watts121> Even with the PC having issues, I'm still having a blast. I drop so many frames when shit goes nuts, and I'm still enjoying the game.
[6:10:00] <%cascadepersona> People were non-stop tslking about FF14 the last 2 months
[6:10:00] <%Brassnarwhal> pat says nothing new has come out good, chat says play old games, that's not the point your missing the point
[6:10:01] <rosabellamelantha> behind the grave that the zombies were worshuipping
[6:10:03] <@QueequegTheater> "What if we just made absolute fucking bangers every single time?"
[6:10:04] <+Ravenian96> Best armor is here btw
[6:10:09] <rosabellamelantha> drop down
[6:10:11] <dds333a> @t_sasquatch most of the stuff I do play is from four gens ago. but yeah, the contemporary stuff has winners LUL
[6:10:20] <projecthazoid> Hades, Endwalker, Pkmn
[6:10:22] <%maskofmichael> Can you imagine the games that would come from Patstaresat Studios?
[6:10:22] <+Ravenian96> Drop down, it's on a big gravestone
[6:10:23] <%JustToWatch> in the first graveyard bit
[6:10:28] <%watts121> What's he looking for Carian Armor?
[6:10:29] <@MistyMntns> No you are not
[6:10:33] <dds333a> BB was just such a fantastic experience, all three playthroughs
[6:10:34] <joodatious> I'd say Endwalker fulfills that feeling
[6:10:36] <rosabellamelantha> nah it's by the cliff on the 2nd island, right side big gravestone
[6:10:45] <%Brassnarwhal> @cascadepersona yeah but you have to play like hundreds of hours to get to the stuff that people are talking about
[6:10:51] <+Ravenian96> Honestly some of my favorite armor is the game tbh
[6:10:51] <plaguedoctor_vi> not here
[6:10:55] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i've been listening to the elden ring ost over and over again over the past few days - even though i still think BB's ost is better there's some real bangers in this game's ost
[6:10:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> different drop but close
[6:11:01] <ziggy_1031> but yeah finish your thoughts pat
[6:11:03] <joodatious> Endwalker and Elden Ring are easily my favorite things in games in a long time
[6:11:06] <radiorosewater> dogs should follow
[6:11:07] <%discoinfierno> Also, we haven't had a game like Bloodborne in the 7 years since it came out
[6:11:10] <+RedMaskBandit> that's your fault tho
[6:11:12] <joodatious> very different reasons
[6:11:19] <%cascadepersona> @brassnarwhal I guess, but that's still a ton of people heaping praise on a game
[6:11:31] <rosabellamelantha> back in the main graveyard it's a BIG gravestone that's marked with a symbol
[6:11:32] <azure_dunes> Idk if it's been said, but the ambient music that sort of plays all the time now and the combat version of it really does a lot when exploring new areas
[6:11:37] <%Brassnarwhal> @cascadepersona it's a great game
[6:11:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> behind
[6:11:51] <rosabellamelantha> on the second island
[6:12:02] <%watts121> IMO this zone is way better at night, it's so atmospheric. I was goin through this part with my torch out.
[6:12:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> you looked right at it for like half a second
[6:12:03] <+hoenhime344> my fav big streamer take on elden righ is Summit1g dude just straight up rage quite
[6:12:10] <%cascadepersona> @brassnarwhal I know, I beat it psaJpeg
[6:12:16] <mar_krow> There is so much
[6:12:16] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[6:12:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> straight from the bridge
[6:12:23] <dds333a> @watts121 sounds fantastic
[6:12:27] <rosabellamelantha> yeah sorry it's hard with twitch delay
[6:12:28] <joodatious> tbh i became a bit jaded with the BOTW hype due to just how much people talked about it since it was on a console i couldn't get
[6:12:29] <%Brassnarwhal> @cascadepersona I'm only 74
[6:12:39] <manoshake> running through zombos
[6:12:41] <iteruq> princess is in different castle
[6:12:47] <dds333a> Pat is straight up that dude in the bible who ran through a graveyard demon possessed LUL
[6:12:47] <%SForlord> There's a surprising amount of hidden stuff in this little area
[6:12:53] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yo the theme for mohg, lord of blood (not a spoiler mods, pat encountered him earlier) is SO FUCKING GOOD
[6:13:03] <%Brassnarwhal> i hear a scarab
[6:13:04] <RyuuAoi> psaGotcha
[6:13:08] <%watts121> I think it's on the other sie?
[6:13:13] <%Brassnarwhal> nice

[6:13:17] <majindusto> I'M SO LOST LOL
[6:13:20] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[6:13:22] <@MistyMntns> Go back to the bridge
[6:13:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> this place is confusing lmao
[6:13:25] <@QueequegTheater> You have to bring scrunko here for it to appear
[6:13:28] <manoshake> one guy
[6:13:30] <+Ravenian96> I missed the armor first time through
[6:13:34] <rosabellamelantha> left
[6:13:34] <dds333a> Just run, you'll find it Kappa

[6:16:28] <manoshake> so you were talking about Bloodborne...
[6:16:31] <%watts121> I did a spell knight build that used that armor plus the sword. The sword is really good despite the bad scaling.

[6:17:19] <iteruq> LUL
[6:17:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> It looks cool with the banished knight helm too
[6:17:19] <%gitgouda> who ever said remove the cape, remove your opinion.
[6:17:20] <Baeltyr> has anyone noticed removing the capes on armours actually makes then slightly worse
[6:17:20] <%ahdurian> yass queen

[6:17:52] <dds333a> @majindusto for real LUL
[6:17:53] <zecht89> that spell sucks
[6:17:55] <%watts121> I have a feeling if Ornstiens helmet was in the game the verison without the plume would be the Altered version.
[6:17:55] <AngryAsian5> DAMN
[6:17:57] <joodatious> that combo is so fucking cool
[6:17:58] <T_Sasquatch> COMBOOOOOOO

[6:18:07] <+alphonseisbest> COMBOOOOOOOO
[6:18:08] <AdmiralButtloaf> did he use gravity on you?
[6:18:09] <Minorou> I like this mixing of elements + status effects
[6:18:09] <RyuuAoi> Woof
[6:18:12] <+hoenhime344> that was a Path of Exile move
[6:18:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> a bit
[6:18:12] <%whyskeywolfe> Rougher than the rest of em
[6:18:15] <%topendbuzza> ya think?
[6:18:16] <dds333a> Might be
[6:18:18] <@QueequegTheater> Frost lightning looks like it's for crowd control
[6:18:19] <+Pendragwn> this is the weakest form Kapp
[6:18:20] <Baeltyr> removing the capes actually lowers the stats of the armours, by like 0.5
[6:18:22] <bassoontyphoon> Holy shit that was sick
[6:18:25] <%epide> omg pat you are
[6:18:26] <joodatious> @watts121 the plume would finally look good

[6:19:54] <%Valdorick> I'm still using the confessor's hood, so the cape looks jank when I use that armor.

[6:20:19] <%furiousfurioso> is that how he stopped the stars??? gravity magic?
[6:20:22] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh, I guess that explains how radahn fought space and won: He uses gravity magic?
[6:20:24] <@QueequegTheater> Negatively
[6:20:30] <%FunkyStreams> FunkyStreams subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Recently drove out to Cali in a 25 y/o car. Got out there, thought to myself "what the fuck am I doing", and proceeded to drive back. Toyota, lets fucking go places.
[6:20:31] <+TheBitingIrish> Because disparage gives it rating
[6:20:33] <%gitgouda> facts
[6:20:36] <joodatious> this is like multiple souls games smashed together
[6:20:40] <Minorou> get ready for Elden Ring to sweep all the gaming awards

[6:20:42] <%Puhff> gumbo game
[6:20:45] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt I will save you time and say yes there is something at the bottom of the janky jump lift but there's a grace nearby at the top so get that first

[6:21:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Learn Radhan's magic, and then sieze the stars yourself.
[6:21:05] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Considering the DS2 director co-directed this, I think they are literally doing a greatest hits collection in this game
[6:21:05] <joodatious> @shootbang_exe yes actually
[6:21:06] <fierysnowflakes> DemonSoulsBorne 4
[6:21:12] <manoshake> they just needed an open world game to fully unleash their creativity
[6:21:15] <azure_dunes> this ambient music really makes the area
[6:21:17] <%watts121> what floored me is those birds in Stormveil with the swords attached to their legs? Never appear anywhere else. It's just for Stormveil. Everyone of the "legacy" dungeons has mobs unique to only them.
[6:21:20] <T_Sasquatch> @hunk_of_dunk he is literally holding the stars in place from moving
[6:21:22] <@QueequegTheater> >left

[6:22:24] <%tetraes> idk a dlc island the size of limgrave for 20 bucks would be cool
[6:22:26] <SpookyMooks> I'm not expecting dlc for at least a few years
[6:22:28] <+Nomenanza> DLC but it is an actual quest journal
[6:22:29] <Minorou> just how many more creative juices can they extract
[6:22:29] <MilletDumplings> sekiro 2 where the whole map is just Japan
[6:22:29] <%watts121> So what do you think the real world size of the Lands Between are? Like Europe sized?

[6:22:44] <SpookyMooks> like a lot of years
[6:22:46] <%Puhff> DLC could take you to The Land of Reeds and now it's Sekiro
[6:22:48] <+OrangeMDT> Nah, they can just release some music or some shit. They’ve done enough
[6:22:50] <+theoldone001> Limgrave alone probably took them like a year.
[6:22:52] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt parts of the map still have clouds covering them is how
[6:22:55] <digaogrunge> What if they Scholar of the First SIn this? Remix all the bullshit

[6:46:47] <17sevens> @cossuoldm there is, but it's really rare to find a drop that just hurts and isn't either perfectly fine or death
[6:46:50] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt os fall damage on this game binary? you either take little to no damage or you just die?
[6:46:51] <+toxinjustin> lightning spear feels so good in this game
[6:46:54] <Snakeofdeath91> Shame they saied more mounts during development
[6:47:00] <%topendbuzza> have we thank patches for the hint?
[6:47:01] <+Ravenian96> Well.... :)
[6:47:04] <%RealThiele> Rune[1]
[6:47:09] <rosabellamelantha> Jump on the crystals
[6:47:12] <rosabellamelantha> its above you
[6:47:12] <kinkade_77> is there an fp regen talisman
[6:47:12] <+hoenhime344> it better be 12k souls lit
[6:47:15] <Baeltyr> did killing it raise your curse bar? or did that happen when it opened up?
[6:47:18] <sothatsprettybrutal> there's fall damage. it's just much much more lenient. or, the distance to get to "any damage" is way higher
[6:47:18] <luciluxlu0> jump up the crystals
[6:47:19] <alaskanbullwurm> you can jump up the crystals on the other end
[6:47:19] <digaogrunge> Climb the crystals
[6:47:20] <dds333a> you get one (1)
[6:47:20] <%DashXero> That's BALLER.
[6:47:27] <tolloponik> is that what I think it is
[6:47:31] <cossuoldm> @dds333a that face doesn't feel me with courage
[6:47:34] <rosabellamelantha> crystals leading to a higher platform

[6:47:44] <rosabellamelantha> missed item
[6:47:54] <Parapattern> Does it have a cat picture, tho?
[6:47:57] <+pectusumbra> I meant that's still cool. No fall damage besides instant fall deaths
[6:47:57] <sothatsprettybrutal> they _reallllly_ should have put a little "you haven't looked at this yet" dot in the corner for all new items
[6:47:59] <sothatsprettybrutal> like really
[6:48:02] <sothatsprettybrutal> patch it in
[6:48:03] <+thesw1tch> thats super fucking worth it in certain situations
[6:48:04] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It feels like the range between starting to take fall damage and instantly dying to a fall is way too short for that to be valuable
[6:48:05] <AtisutoCurry> damn
[6:48:09] <DerpioParty> Was that the burger king king?
[6:48:09] <+Ravenian96> Now you're in the Burger King's palace

[6:56:29] <azure_dunes> GUESS I'LL BE SESRCHING FOR THAT
[6:56:31] <+hoenhime344> the sprinting atttack seems REALLY good on the scyths
[6:56:32] <mkat64> Do you guys reckon someone who’s never played any dark souls game could play this? I heavily suggested they played them first but she doesn’t seem to care

[7:02:08] <RubberFistFight> what'd i miss
[7:02:11] <RubberFistFight> i saw pat fighting red doge
[7:02:25] <Jontman42> @funkystreams omg your name even fits
[7:02:26] <%FunkyStreams> lol
[7:02:32] <RubberFistFight> @FunkyStreams hah. elden. coz he's OLD
[7:02:51] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Whelp I revalidated the files and reinstalled my graphics driver and Elden Ring is Still crashing my PC after I load my save.
[7:03:03] <%FunkyStreams> yep
[7:03:08] <Jontman42> oh nooo
[7:03:43] <%SirGO0SE> woah did he pee his pants or something that was fast
[7:04:01] <HotSauceFiend> Fuizoh
[7:04:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's called a power piss
[7:04:08] <%DanThePumpkinman> you are currently the small pat, just a heads up
[7:04:15] <%Monkeyweed21> It’s so good x4
[7:04:23] <+FallenWard> hi pat, take this bullshit
[7:04:30] <%Frostofthecwsw> @dakotamacdoodle have fun restarting
[7:04:33] <%FunkyStreams> @PatStaresAt YOLO
[7:04:36] <+FallenWard> FallenWard subscribed with Prime. 
[7:04:41] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Elden Ring has got so much stuff that I've seen people calling it DS2 2, DS3 2, DeS 2, and BB 2 and they're all correct
[7:04:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @danthepumpkinman no that’s his normal size
[7:04:46] <RubberFistFight> @DakotaMacDoodle pc port's kinda busted. check your windows event viewer for critical events (big red X) around the times you tried to launch it, and see if it calls out the faulting module.
[7:04:52] <+theoldone001> How much more will you stream Pat?
[7:05:02] <ape_hawk> because you came on the other one??
[7:05:09] <+lucky_icarus> Yo @patstaresat Does that chest have an alt design?
[7:05:21] <mkat64> I haven’t played this yet, but I know GRRM helped write this game, and I’m a huge fan of him, any opinions so far?
[7:05:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Elden ring is approaching something designed for normal humans
[7:05:26] <%Kevlar_Caviar> boss is coming up real quick so yeah i'd say keep going
[7:05:27] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You are like 70% through it
[7:05:28] <lunathemelodicdictator> xcordeHeart
[7:05:28] <+theoldone001> Its a pretty big zone
[7:05:31] <@Spydurman> you're in the right area
[7:05:34] <%cade_calrayn> I'd wager about an hour more, if you skip the roof shenangins
[7:05:38] <Baeltyr> it also will have lower stats
[7:05:44] <%topendbuzza> gross
[7:05:44] <%thenewjudas> I beat her unlocked the respect now I have no idea where to go
[7:05:44] <rosabellamelantha> I went cape off all game
[7:05:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @losergirl43 he only wrote the background lore, so there's only a hint of GRRM, but it's there
[7:05:54] <$MandMGrease> Looks more like a scarf than a cape
[7:05:57] <%cade_calrayn> Less than an  hour if you're good at the boss
[7:05:58] <+TheBitingIrish> Doesn't look too terrible
[7:05:58] <+lucky_icarus> Cape stays on, I agree
[7:06:01] <roguemephilesclone> Does the boss break Ranni's quest, or is it okay?
[7:06:02] <+alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt don't kill the FINAL boss of this zone, I heard it fucks with Ranni's quest
[7:06:06] <%tetraes> @thenewjudas  Caelid
[7:06:07] <+alphonseisbest> drippless
[7:06:07] <sirrice77> @thenewjudas east
[7:06:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> I want my character to have as much secondary motion as possible
[7:06:12] <%shootbang_exe> I'm torn on respec-ing rn. I went for an int/dex build but damn faith and str builds get so much cool stuff
[7:06:14] <%FallenWard> capes = +5 cool, everybody knows that
[7:06:15] <RyuuAoi> It wasn't bad but cape better
[7:06:23] <+LandOfTheWay> no it doesn't
[7:06:25] <%cade_calrayn> You can get around that with absolution, guys
[7:06:26] <%tyler274> oh oof then im fucked
[7:06:27] <@QueequegTheater> One Guy
[7:06:29] <T_Sasquatch> It doesn't
[7:06:29] <%discoinfierno> ignore them
[7:06:29] <+Ravenian96> I don't think killing the boss does anything
[7:06:29] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt that's completely untrue, i'm still on her quest and it's fine.
[7:06:32] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> tha cant be true
[7:06:32] <meloshav> no it's fine for tennis quest
[7:06:33] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it only fucks with it if you do it before she tells you to do so
[7:06:33] <%Felhad> It does not
[7:06:33] <+brandonsbetow> str+faith is super cool
[7:06:33] <milkandcreamer> nop
[7:06:34] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i've heard both ways
[7:06:35] <%Kevlar_Caviar> so idk
[7:06:35] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> ONE GUY
[7:06:36] <RyuuAoi> Granny? Ha
[7:06:38] <ape_hawk> One Guy
[7:06:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> uhhh i already did, i don't think it does
[7:06:42] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's wrong
[7:06:42] <+alphonseisbest> my b
[7:06:43] <%whyskeywolfe> It is nonsense.
[7:06:46] <%Valdorick> Liar ahead
[7:06:47] <+PkSilent01> One Guy
[7:06:48] <haisho> we have magic forgiveness juide that revives the dead somehow don't we?
[7:06:48] <DrBadyear> to be fair it's a fromsoft game
[7:06:50] <+RushUnplugged> seems like the falsest ONEGUY to ever ONEGUY
[7:06:50] <%Monkeyweed21> That’s ultra wrong
[7:06:50] <+vaderxyz1970> Dude what the fuck
[7:06:51] <TheBlankAce> Yeah I'm pretty sure thats very untrue
[7:06:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> It really seems like it would but apparently not
[7:06:51] <+alphonseisbest> I hear she was connected
[7:06:51] <%gitgouda> that definatly seems like nonsense seing how the quest plays out and rannis quest comes AFTER this boss
[7:06:54] <rosabellamelantha> super wrong
[7:06:54] <+spottedwolf10> I've played about 20 hours on PC without any issues, is it a software thing or hardware thing for PC issues to arise?
[7:06:55] <+emoprawn> @PatStaresAt It makes it a bit wonkier to get going but does not make it impossible I did it on my playthrough after the boss
[7:06:58] <%DanThePumpkinman> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[7:06:59] <%zarkazeon> that's  not how that works
[7:06:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Oh no The games been out for couple of das we gott experts
[7:07:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> its unclear
[7:07:01] <+brandonsbetow> it might be PC
[7:07:02] <@QueequegTheater> @alphonseisbest Everyone laugh at this man
[7:07:04] <vicar_anat> Confidently incorrect
[7:07:08] <T_Sasquatch> I've literally watched a streamer do it
[7:07:14] <+zaddyforever> i think it messes it up if you haven’t started it yet
[7:07:17] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> psa1guy
[7:07:25] <RyuuAoi> Gief
[7:07:28] <+brandonsbetow> I have had issues with the quest on PC
[7:07:29] <@QueequegTheater> @zaddyforever I hadn't started it and it was fine
[7:07:31] <+zaddyforever> but you can fix it by absolving yourself or something
[7:07:41] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You actually need to beat her to finish her quest
[7:07:45] <RubberFistFight> people are just repeating shit that one guy who heard it from his girlfriend's husband's sister's side piece a week ago before the game released.
[7:07:54] <%cade_calrayn> @QueequegTheater the odd thing is, Buns hadn't started Ranni's quest - she said "not yet" to the wanna-join-the-team question, and she went to her tower after Rennala, and Ranni was gone
[7:07:57] <ape_hawk> evcerything okay?
[7:08:07] <+LandOfTheWay> i can 100% confirm it doesn't fuck up ranni's questline
[7:08:19] <%FallenWard> jump jump jump
[7:08:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> ooh
[7:08:39] <RyuuAoi> Use the cat thing
[7:08:41] <%cade_calrayn> I think it only fucks up the quest *if* you haven't started Ranni's questline
[7:08:43] <%SirGO0SE> the "First off, you don't have the right" message has been cracking me up all day its so god damn sassy
[7:08:45] <+theoldone001> Talisman
[7:08:46] <+RushUnplugged> talisman?
[7:08:54] <+RushUnplugged> yeah it's there
[7:08:58] <+LandOfTheWay> talisman
[7:09:00] <+brandonsbetow> shit, I wasn't paying attention to how pat got up there
[7:09:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> holy fuck he's all ab
[7:09:21] <ape_hawk> its redhead jesus
[7:09:21] <milkandcreamer> man I wanna be big greatsword poise man, but the lighter armor designs in this game are sick
[7:09:21] <%tyler274> what room is this?
[7:09:24] <%tyler274> I missed that
[7:09:29] <+RushUnplugged> that's a faster
[7:09:32] <Baeltyr> charge it
[7:09:32] <%FallenWard> much faster
[7:09:34] <RubberFistFight> I've seen people confidently repeating that beating Radhan puts you into the endgame. Which is absolutely false but hey, that's never stopped anyone before.
[7:09:36] <@Spydurman> faster
[7:09:36] <%cade_calrayn> @brandonsbetow turn right after going out into the courtyard from the debate hall and follow it around to a ladder
[7:09:39] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt fun fact with the quest fuckening pretty sure that even if ranni gets mad you can just go absolve yourself and clear it so just check in with the church of vows after besting rennala
[7:09:41] <+stellarseeker> Charge time go down?
[7:09:41] <roguemephilesclone> I COULD TELL, HOLY MOLY.
[7:09:41] <+tizziks> try frozen lightning, longer cast
[7:09:42] <RyuuAoi> Meh
[7:09:46] <Parapattern> About a quarter faster I'd say
[7:09:48] <%notsoy> compare fully charged shots
[7:09:57] <roguemephilesclone> Spells have never been more viable!
[7:10:08] <haisho> bye fap ring
[7:10:08] <+hoenhime344> so so amazing to see how far demons souls has come
[7:10:16] <mf_doomfist98> these spells look so awesome may have to stray away from greatsword build for this game
[7:10:18] <roguemephilesclone> Elden Ring is an apology letter to magic users everywhere!
[7:10:22] <+hoenhime344> 2009 to now. god this is a trip
[7:10:26] <%GalacticaPhanto> I'm raging at the dumb Ulcered Tree fucker, I hate that shit
[7:10:40] <Saltmeisterr> ok why is it called FAP tho?
[7:10:43] <+RushUnplugged> shotgun
[7:10:43] <%SirGO0SE> PotFriend
[7:10:44] <roguemephilesclone> Wizard Shotgun
[7:10:45] <@QueequegTheater> BOOM
[7:10:53] <%FunkyStreams> wow
[7:10:55] <RyuuAoi> POT
[7:11:01] <Saltmeisterr> ah
[7:11:02] <roguemephilesclone> As opposed to Pat's earlier Insanity Shotgun.
[7:11:06] <bassoontyphoon> Wizards casting buckshot now
[7:11:08] <+lucky_icarus> I will say one thing I love about this game is the same as in Breath of the Wild. "Yo, there's what all the way over there? Fuck yeah, let's BEELINE!"
[7:11:26] <roguemephilesclone> PotFriend is a global emote?!
[7:11:34] <%crot454> crot454 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! hello
[7:11:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> there's a sword especially in particular Woolie will want strongly
[7:11:49] <%SirGO0SE> for someone not really touching magic i feel like im having a hard time gearing up
[7:11:55] <%Felremi> location?
[7:11:57] <Saltmeisterr> the nerd zone
[7:12:00] <+null_the_exhero> I've gotten like a dozen memory stones and I'm running a quality build lol
[7:12:01] <+Grayhammatter> magic though
[7:12:05] <+zaddyforever> magic is insane in this game
[7:12:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> PotFriend PotFriend
[7:12:09] <@QueequegTheater> @SirGO0SE what build
[7:12:16] <Saltmeisterr> unlike the chad arcane/ot zone
[7:12:21] <%FallenWard> everyone ive seen play has the small teeny tiny hp problem,
[7:12:22] <bassoontyphoon> What stats do gravity spells use
[7:12:23] <+RushUnplugged> I was stunned that you can actually skip Stormveil by just... riding around
[7:12:24] <plaguedoctor_vi> to be fair i got a S scaling staff in the rot area and a graviry spell that are better than most things here
[7:12:25] <+alphonseisbest> man Its gonna be rough even choosing what build to as in this
[7:12:34] <+cowkid222> it's the scythe a Dex weapon chat?
[7:12:38] <+lucky_icarus> Yeah there's a SUPER good staff in Cael roughly near Guts sword, going there as soon as I get Torrent
[7:12:44] <Midnight188> either my conncection is whack or stream is skipping
[7:12:46] <%SirGO0SE> @QueequegTheater i went wretched and right now I'm at 20 endurance 21 str and 14 dex. still 10/10 faith int
[7:12:47] <@QueequegTheater> @cowkid222 Dex faith
[7:12:48] <%FunkyStreams> how come we cant have that in real life. it would be fine.
[7:12:52] <+cowkid222> new to this type of game
[7:12:57] <+cowkid222> rad thanks
[7:12:59] <Midnight188> sometimes he teleports forwards and i skip stuff
[7:12:59] <%notsoy> did he get guts sword yet
[7:13:02] <Explodincatz> how many cracked pots u have so far?
[7:13:04] <%topendbuzza> what is Paige building?
[7:13:21] <%octavian_wolf> yo, you can help Yura?!
[7:13:23] <%FallenWard> i wonder if twitch updated their sub streak thing, ive subbed a lot in the past but now it only says 1 month
[7:13:25] <@QueequegTheater> @SirGO0SE Pump Vig, End, Str, and start upgrading a greatsword and a club
[7:13:32] <%FallenWard> big sad
[7:13:45] <ITechedDat> i'm half expecting me to walk into a new zone and a message pop up saying "welcome to dark souls 4". this game is so huge lol
[7:13:56] <%therustystream> why is pat back here?
[7:14:01] <@QueequegTheater> @ITechedDat "God of War"
[7:14:01] <%FunkyStreams> @FallenWard I think it needs to be consecutive.
[7:14:02] <+beavnation> whats that status that pops up now and again?
[7:14:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> So this is what the Nameless King was up to
[7:14:04] <T_Sasquatch> I really dislike how you have to "earn" respecs in this game. It should be free and available from the start instead of having an fun build for like a quarter to half of the gane
[7:14:18] <%therustystream> wait did he not do this part yet?
[7:14:22] <RubberFistFight> magical burger king's gonna fuck ya'
[7:14:25] <Oath_Othelio> wait how did he get this far into this place without seeing one of them
[7:14:27] <T_Sasquatch> An unfun*
[7:14:27] <%FallenWard> @FunkyStreams i hadnt noticed it in the past
[7:14:34] <senfood> You interrupted their lecture, PAT
[7:14:36] <+hoenhime344> @ITechedDat im amazed at how many gigs it is...
[7:14:37] <%FunkyStreams> weird.
[7:14:39] <RyuuAoi> Peach seems like a strength build so far.
[7:14:51] <+hoenhime344> like HOW is warzone 100gigs and this is 45
[7:14:55] <%bilyso> that is a sick spell
[7:14:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> good item
[7:15:05] <RyuuAoi> Crowd control fr
[7:15:11] <@QueequegTheater> @hoenhime344 Japan knows how to condense
[7:15:30] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE havent seen a greatsword but noted. just learned today i should be spending some of those smithing stones since they  apparently arent as rare as i thought
[7:15:32] <%Felhad> used a Cold Halberd for a while, was solid
[7:15:32] <%FallenWard> aaaaaaa shit here i go again
[7:15:38] <+lucky_icarus> God fuck, I HAVE to get here! There's so much rad shit!
[7:15:39] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt Frost is super fucking strong in this game too i'm really happy with all the frost spells
[7:15:42] <@QueequegTheater> Anyone know where to get the Bleed affinity whetstone?
[7:15:42] <Saltmeisterr> who got what?
[7:15:47] <%DashXero> Appropriate. Since most intelligent people are cold af. Kidding.
[7:15:50] <Oath_Othelio> @SirGO0SE looking for a greatsword or ugs?
[7:15:53] <%FallenWard> FallenWard is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[7:15:54] <%FallenWard> FallenWard gifted a Tier 1 sub to HexLotus! 
[7:15:54] <%FallenWard> FallenWard gifted a Tier 1 sub to keiraffxiv! 
[7:15:55] <ITechedDat> @hoenhime344 a lot of extremely high res textures X a ridiculous amount of cosmetics
[7:15:55] <%gitgouda> your right, now give sorceries the frozen lightning spear and eveyrthing will be right in the world.
[7:16:01] <%bilyso> can't wait till I have the money for this game
[7:16:16] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE i definitely am, still ysing lorians i think its called
[7:16:36] <%SForlord> I like the flower eating crabs
[7:16:52] <@QueequegTheater> woolieCRAB
[7:16:53] <Baeltyr> ghost crab
[7:16:57] <%SForlord> I like the shiny crab
[7:17:06] <%FallenWard> time for crab
[7:17:11] <Oath_Othelio> he was smart
[7:17:18] <@QueequegTheater> Be wary of pincer attack
[7:17:20] <+GallowsDrop> he ate it it was lunch
[7:17:24] <%crot454> because crab went to college
[7:17:26] <Parapattern> Just a silly lil crab
[7:17:29] <+hoenhime344> @hoenhime344 warzone textures are NOT that high res.. b ut you right on the cosmetics
[7:17:31] <+GallowsDrop> he got it from the mess hall
[7:17:33] <%FallenWard> :)
[7:17:35] <maxpasta> Not enough stamina to walk around with it
[7:17:35] <%bilyso> I am absolutely going for a swordmage build
[7:17:41] <%SForlord> big crab
[7:17:50] <%FallenWard> @bilyso prisoner for easy start
[7:17:52] <@QueequegTheater> D: RACIST AGAINST CRAB
[7:18:03] <majindusto> CRAB BATTLE
[7:18:08] <+alphonseisbest> @hoenhime344 its also uncompressed audio for EVERY language the game is dubbed in
[7:18:14] <meloshav> pat there's a shortcut back to the grace off that cliff
[7:18:16] <%SirGO0SE> crab people are people too :(
[7:18:17] <tanarath> 🦀
[7:18:36] <+cowkid222> beyblade
[7:18:40] <%SpontaneousC> that thing dont fuck around
[7:18:42] <%FallenWard> oh yeah? then why are the crab people so delicious with butter sauce then
[7:18:45] <majindusto> Speeen
[7:18:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> So casual with the Swing
[7:18:53] <+hoenhime344> @hoenhime344 yea i was gonna say that next. the audio is crzy
[7:18:54] <tanarath> spin to win
[7:18:55] <%bilyso> how does the game run on base ps4 does anyone know?
[7:19:06] <%therustystream> has pat done the boss here yet?
[7:19:15] <@QueequegTheater> no
[7:19:16] <%Pookiedaexzile> "imma just do a little death twirl"
[7:19:17] <RyuuAoi> I wish you could do that helicopter shit too with your weapon set
[7:19:17] <joodatious> no
[7:19:17] <%D00msDayDan> i was just stuck for like an hour fighting a machine in horizon that kills you in pretty much the same way
[7:19:25] <+hoenhime344> @hoenhime344 its the reason guns of the patiots was so huge
[7:19:30] <%therustystream> @QueequegTheater I'm shocked he didn't get here earlier
[7:19:32] <+alphonseisbest> @bilyso locked 30fps and other than that fine kinda
[7:19:33] <%FallenWard> ezezez
[7:19:39] <%therustystream> I just did this and it was the first main thing I did after godrick
[7:19:43] <%FunkyStreams> thunderbolt, thunderbolt, thunderbolt.
[7:19:50] <majindusto> Where did it come from?...Where did it Go?
[7:19:57] <meloshav> yeah if you jump off it takes you there
[7:19:57] <+ATorL> you die and you go straight to the grace, obviously
[7:20:18] <+cowkid222> @bilyso I'm playing on base now. runs fine in like smaller fights, but with more enemies and distance enemies you can see the frames drop to like, 15 it's kinda funny
[7:20:35] <+cowkid222> but running around and game feel it's still so good
[7:20:42] <%therustystream> I think I love this level but there's a few really annoying bits
[7:20:43] <+geekjacob> stun lock
[7:20:44] <+hoenhime344> omg...these are the guys from bolitaria
[7:20:50] <@QueequegTheater> @cowkid222 Halo 4 did the same thing because there was no way in hell Halo 4 should have run on a 360
[7:20:56] <joodatious> pats gonna have a bad time soon lol
[7:21:05] <RyuuAoi> Yo he made it!
[7:21:13] <$Falilth> @PatStaresAt  is this anor londo?
[7:21:22] <%therustystream> oh look it's annoying bits
[7:21:25] <%topendbuzza> rooftop hooligans
[7:21:27] <%FallenWard> :O
[7:21:30] <RyuuAoi> Gargoyles?
[7:21:38] <%bilyso> as long as it runs decently enough, that's fine with me.
[7:21:42] <+cowkid222> @queequegtheater honestly I was nervous base ps4 was going to do MUCH worse than how it is
[7:21:53] <bassoontyphoon> They remind me of the flexile sentry in ds2
[7:22:03] <+cowkid222> can deal with some derpy looking enemies here and there
[7:22:06] <%FallenWard> visions of big archers
[7:22:06] <@QueequegTheater> @cowkid222 I bet the textures are significantly worse though
[7:22:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> fixed a an issue where the gpu wasn't being used
[7:22:20] <%therustystream> have fun
[7:22:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> the patches says you should get caught by the iron virgin at the bottom of reya lucaria Kappa
[7:22:26] <%FunkyStreams> 'users with computers that cost less than five grand can now run the game.'
[7:22:35] <$Falilth> Patch 1.02.2 for PC and PS5 available now.  PC: 💠Fixed an issue where the graphics card was not being used, resulting in slow performance. 💠Fixed a bug that caused the game to quit under certain conditions during a battle with the Fire Giant. 💠Fixed other bugs.
[7:22:41] <+theoldone001> Wait there's a new patch?
[7:22:48] <%therustystream> this spell seems pretty effective
[7:22:50] <@QueequegTheater> >Fixed other bugs
[7:22:53] <@QueequegTheater> GEE THANKS
[7:22:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Zappo"
[7:22:58] <@QueequegTheater> THAT CLEARS IT RIGHT UP
[7:23:00] <meloshav> pat playing like gwyn lord of cinder
[7:23:01] <%D00msDayDan> i want patch notes to say created new bugs
[7:23:04] <%therustystream> what was the smash balance version
[7:23:07] <$Falilth> the bugs you didn't know about yet
[7:23:09] <%therustystream> >numerous balance fixes
[7:23:10] <radiorosewater> so it still is worthless
[7:23:13] <+ATorL> "did some stuff"
[7:23:13] <radiorosewater> great
[7:23:15] <%notsoy> the smash patch notes used to be especially egregious
[7:23:16] <%gitgouda> loved playing through this area
[7:23:18] <%therustystream> something like that
[7:23:21] <ape_hawk> In Guild Wars 2, every patch always has "Fixed a server crash" in it
[7:23:21] <+cowkid222> @queequegtheater they aren't great, but I think the environment design for me anyway distracts from some of the tech limitations
[7:23:29] <tolloponik> Smash Bros. :character's moves have been changed
[7:23:30] <majindusto> ANOTHER  LONDO
[7:23:32] <%SWFanatic> Are ya winnin son?
[7:23:33] <+theoldone001> This next jump I had to take my armor off
[7:23:35] <%therustystream> @ape_hawk that's really funny
[7:23:40] <%FunkyStreams> I need there to be a silver Knight that just comes out from no where and powerbombs the shit out of your char.
[7:23:41] <luciluxlu0> pat, now that they have a jump button, the whole game is anor londo
[7:23:41] <%crot454> would you rather it say fixed insect?
[7:23:43] <@QueequegTheater> @cowkid222 Yeah, DS1 on 360 felt the same way
[7:23:44] <+cowkid222> plus the gameplay is still A++ even on ps4
[7:23:46] <+Grayhammatter> is this anor londo?
[7:23:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> Bitch no
[7:23:47] <senfood> I like how this feels like Anor Londo and we're nowhere close to the Anor Londo equivalent.
[7:23:50] <+ATorL> wew
[7:23:51] <%therustystream> WOAH
[7:23:51] <%FallenWard> big hops
[7:23:54] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[7:23:54] <Catoclystic> If you think this area is Anor Londo levels just wait until you head north
[7:23:55] <TheDarthWraith> lol LUL
[7:23:57] <tanarath> just state them. under class & directly address stuff like ff14 & others do
[7:24:02] <+theoldone001> This is a one way trip too lol
[7:24:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> He's Starting to believe
[7:24:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> its a little easier if you angle your jump
[7:24:06] <RyuuAoi> Wow luck
[7:24:09] <mkat64> I haven’t played this yet, but I know GRRM helped write this game, and I’m a huge fan of him anyone who likes him can you guys feel his writing in the game?
[7:24:13] <ianabstract> gargoyle archers
[7:24:15] <+zaddyforever> this place is so confusing, i have no idea how to actually progress
[7:24:20] <$Falilth> @D00msDayDan  there are games that tell you that they made bugs  in patch notes. i wanna say ffxiv does?
[7:24:23] <+zaddyforever> i found a sick staff but where the hell is renalla
[7:24:24] <@QueequegTheater> @losergirl43 He only wrote the background events
[7:24:26] <%therustystream> I didn't go this way
[7:24:31] <+brandonsbetow> way more adventerous then i was
[7:24:34] <%therustystream> I didn't think you could clear that jump
[7:24:35] <tolloponik> oh man these guy on a narrow platform is mean
[7:24:43] <ITechedDat> @losergirl43 he only helped with some of the base worldbuilding, but you can see it in names like Stormveil
[7:24:45] <+alphonseisbest> @losergirl43 yes thou more in the lore
[7:24:49] <%therustystream> wtf is this ladder
[7:25:01] <mar_krow> I went away how we on the roof now
[7:25:03] <mkat64> @queequegtheater but like can you feel his influence at all?
[7:25:07] <joodatious> i love how when the spear hits theres a strike of lighting that goes through from above
[7:25:11] <%FunkyStreams> SNAAAAKE
[7:25:15] <%therustystream> oh fuck
[7:25:16] <%notsoy> what a thrill
[7:25:18] <@QueequegTheater> @losergirl43 I don't know what you're asking for
[7:25:19] <senfood> Appraised the message before killing them LUL
[7:25:19] <%therustystream> what a thrill
[7:25:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> YOu can Feel Grrm Influence, there's a Dude named Dung Eater whose indignant too you about how filthy he is
[7:25:24] <%FallenWard> EAAATERRRRR
[7:25:25] <ITechedDat> What a thrill...
[7:25:30] <%BubbaRands> what a thrill~
[7:25:36] <%FunkyStreams> yes!
[7:25:37] <+geekjacob> snake eater
[7:25:40] <haisho> what
[7:25:40] <%Kevlar_Caviar> the claw is REQUIRED when switching items during a fight
[7:25:41] <majindusto> SNAKE EATER!!!
[7:25:43] <+alphonseisbest> hah
[7:25:43] <mkat64> @itecheddat just wondering if it’s worth trying this game cause he’s my favourite authore ygm
[7:25:47] <%Buzzard42> Poggies
[7:25:49] <%cascadepersona> I give my life, not for honor, but for you
[7:25:50] <+alphonseisbest> MH STRIKES AGAIN
[7:25:54] <tolloponik> how much of a work out is it to climb a ladder that long
[7:26:06] <tanarath> Forbidden Technique: DEMON CLAW OF DARK POWER
[7:26:06] <+darkgear_96> the xbox elite controller is cool because of the paddles you dont need the claw
[7:26:09] <+GallowsDrop> not for honor but for youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[7:26:11] <%cascadepersona> Is that Rinoa's weapon?
[7:26:15] <$Falilth> it said will shoot god
[7:26:20] <Midnight188> autocrossbow?
[7:26:21] <mar_krow> Cool
[7:26:27] <+ATorL> I should try crossbows some time but I always feel like the ability to aim with bows is too enticing
[7:26:30] <+alphonseisbest> @losergirl43 hmmm, i'd look into seeing if u like souls game first, this is one of those first and formost
[7:26:31] <tolloponik> 14 int I can use that now, but getting here at my level...
[7:26:31] <b_ikki> i really missed the rooftop shit tbh
[7:26:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Dark Souls 4 thru 8
[7:26:33] <%shootbang_exe> well shit I didn't know that was there, time to go back....
[7:26:37] <%therustystream> Lol I love it
[7:26:41] <majindusto> STOUPID
[7:26:46] <%therustystream> it's a great level
[7:26:47] <%Buzzard42> PogBones
[7:27:00] <%FunkyStreams> Freddy Mercury would be proud of your build, Pat.
[7:27:06] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh wow he was FREAKING OUT
[7:27:09] <%crot454> god the levels in these are so good so far
[7:27:10] <+zaddyforever> @tolloponik it’s a lot easier once you realize this place rewards ignoring crowds and rushing enemies with melee
[7:27:15] <@QueequegTheater> I didn't even find any of this rooftop shit wtf
[7:27:18] <slix3431> ELMO
[7:27:30] <tanarath> emlo
[7:27:36] <%SForlord> This music is very spooky
[7:27:44] <%therustystream> This was a great early game spot for me tbh
[7:27:47] <%RealThiele> :O goddamn its all the way out here
[7:27:56] <senfood> This place is Hogwarts on bath salts.
[7:27:57] <+Vigonept> is this anor londo
[7:28:06] <%therustystream> it's dark souls harry potter
[7:28:11] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> If the top key went to that fucked up tornado zone I'm scared to find out where the others go
[7:28:11] <%therustystream> good vibes
[7:28:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> these roofs were my favorite part of this area
[7:28:25] <%RealThiele> tiny hat dudes
[7:28:30] <%crot454> oh pat have you tried dual spears yet?
[7:28:31] <@QueequegTheater> @ReallyBigRocks I didn't even know about them NotLikeThis

[7:31:16] <+Grayhammatter> the answer was yes
[7:31:17] <RubberFistFight> god i hate those things
[7:31:17] <%JustToWatch> I think there was a path that you missed after the crazy jump
[7:31:27] <%FallenWard> dumbledore is off his meds and really kicking ass
[7:31:33] <%RealThiele> thats why i love the heal on crit talisman its a big save
[7:31:35] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt dude stop letting the burger king hit you Kappa
[7:31:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> It feels so good to run through here after finding the path
[7:31:40] <%sniffy77> almost died to a book
[7:31:47] <haisho> was he...slapping you around with a book?
[7:31:54] <+hoenhime344> the book is stronk

[7:32:44] <%therustystream> I love the spaz attack
[7:32:44] <+hoenhime344> WTF was that
[7:32:46] <RubberFistFight> robutts
[7:32:52] <%FunkyStreams> check it out, Ellie!
[7:32:52] <AtisutoCurry> love the podcast bit where you and Paige just say "this is the best game ever" back and forth to each other
[7:32:53] <@DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt Happy to report I have found a workaround for the system crashing I started a new save got past the opening and quit to the menu loaded my original save game and it's all good now maybe? shits fucked
[7:32:54] <+hoenhime344> was that a real animation?
[7:32:54] <+pectusumbra> zombies on the outside, puppets on the inside
[7:33:06] <%JoshManVGH> Pat has found so many sections of this map that I haven't found. This may be the best game ever
[7:33:07] <tolloponik> what do they need so many robots for
[7:33:12] <majindusto> This place  is Real
[7:33:13] <bassoontyphoon> It’s puppets all the way down
[7:33:16] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Gotta say, I love the aesthetic of sorceries in this game. The hard black interiors and more aggressive trail particles do wonders
[7:33:19] <%topendbuzza> not a bit tho
[7:33:21] <+zaddyforever> wow, the spell you get with loretta really simplified this for me
[7:33:37] <senfood> Literally did that before lol
[7:33:46] <Namillus> Lightning Spear is SO FAST in this game!
[7:34:00] <%therustystream> same floor as the enemies
[7:34:01] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt down on the place where the burger kings killed you before
[7:34:03] <%therustystream> right by your corpse
[7:34:05] <%therustystream> I think
[7:34:08] <+Ravenian96> late game elden ring is the strongest i've ever felt in a souls game tbh
[7:34:18] <+zaddyforever> @namillus he also just grabbed a talisman that shortens casting time by like a quarter
[7:34:29] <+Grayhammatter> are we just calling them burger kings now?
[7:34:35] <roguemephilesclone> Pat has an amulet equipped that is speeding up his Lightning Spear.
[7:34:43] <%topendbuzza> jambalam
[7:34:50] <RubberFistFight> @Grayhammatter i hope so coz that's all i see when i look at em
[7:34:51] <%zarkazeon> .....I just did one of the hardest/longest questlines.... for a weapon I can't even use...
[7:34:51] <%SWFanatic> crsb
[7:34:55] <senfood> Big Burger King
[7:34:58] <+ithonmage> double patty
[7:35:01] <%FallenWard> absolute bozo, complete burger jesters
[7:35:05] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh, that one's magic sword is purple instead of blue like the others. I wonder if that does something different
[7:35:08] <%therustystream> anything left besides boss?
[7:35:11] <$Falilth> GLASS CANNON MAGIC BUILD LETS GOOOOO
[7:35:17] <%therustystream> that was a side path lol
[7:35:18] <Manwad> you can stack int with items like crazy, that's rad
[7:35:19] <%JoshManVGH> Sure is!
[7:35:20] <b_ikki> the main areas in this game are insanely massive
[7:35:22] <roguemephilesclone> Wow Billie, your mom let's you have two helmets?
[7:35:22] <RubberFistFight> I even yelled out RONALD MCDONALD SENDS HIS REGARDS when i killed a particularly irritating one. Because i'm cripplingly unfunny.
[7:35:24] <+zaddyforever> does anyone know if the blessed dew talisman actually heals enough to matter?
[7:35:25] <%SWFanatic> So GRRM loves Burger King?
[7:35:26] <%therustystream> HOLY SHIT
[7:35:28] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @zarkazeon Is it at least cool?
[7:35:29] <+hoenhime344> wow geometry
[7:35:31] <ohno58> you got the laddder
[7:35:34] <senfood> Luckily, it was a shortcut.
[7:35:34] <%SpontaneousC> I literally blinked and Pat was dead
[7:35:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah thats a bad route to go in there LUL
[7:35:37] <%sniffy77> you can teleport to the grace to get there quicker
[7:35:38] <%FunkyStreams> killed by geometry souls
[7:35:38] <%therustystream> best game of all time
[7:35:43] <%maskofmichael> when it's open world, aren't all paths side paths
[7:35:46] <RubberFistFight> you got the ladder tho!
[7:35:48] <bassoontyphoon> That’s rough buddy
[7:35:55] <RubberFistFight> also there's a path to the right you haven't taken
[7:35:58] <fierysnowflakes> Look on the bright side, you can climb back up!
[7:36:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> THat was called a challenge
[7:36:04] <RubberFistFight> across from the door you just wne through
[7:36:04] <+hoenhime344> @SWFanatic i dont think grrm had anything to do with the design. just the writing
[7:36:12] <+alphonseisbest> man I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE SPEED RUNS OF THIS GAME
[7:36:17] <Happydisaster> you opened a short cut to a different bonfire
[7:36:18] <+alphonseisbest> Its gonna be nuts!
[7:36:23] <%FallenWard> less mind more muscle
[7:36:25] <%topendbuzza> don't we all
[7:36:27] <%FallenWard> big muscle
[7:36:31] <%therustystream> the other bonfire is right next to your corpse fyi
[7:36:34] <roguemephilesclone> Need bigger brain.
[7:36:35] <+Etherealizer> same but irl
[7:36:36] <%shootbang_exe> I pumped mine to 25 and it's great
[7:36:37] <ape_hawk> ingame or irl?
[7:36:38] <%SWFanatic> @SWFanatic So you're saying Burger King paid GRRM for the official promotion we're seeing?
[7:36:43] <@QueequegTheater> I don't need mind, I have a spiked mace
[7:36:54] <%therustystream> wait you didn't go in that cathedral yet???
[7:36:55] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt lol yeah the main path is actually to the right up that disconnected staircase.
[7:37:11] <%RealThiele> bloodhound fang gives you sick backdash combos
[7:37:32] <+hoenhime344> can you cgarge ALL the spells?
[7:37:32] <+zaddyforever> @rubberfistfight are you supposed to just jump!

[7:38:44] <%sniffy77> pat you've been there before

[7:42:44] <%FunkyStreams> @SpontaneousC I was skeptical about how they would still do the classic interconnects with the OW. But they somehow managed to like double down on it.
[7:42:49] <%RealThiele> i farm right outside beast church the tiny dudes are worth a ton and stagger easy
[7:43:03] <RubberFistFight> honestly dude you need more health
[7:43:07] <%JoshManVGH> Paiges grinding spot has been pretty sweet. It's bought be so many nice things today.
[7:43:07] <%sniffy77> HEAL
[7:43:13] <+BewbsOP> Hey pat, are we cool to give hints on progression? I don't break any rules.
[7:43:13] <@QueequegTheater> You're like 20 levels above  the area lmao

[7:43:24] <%sniffy77> Pat thats the graveyard
[7:43:27] <%cade_calrayn> that's the graveyard
[7:43:30] <meloshav> health is more important in this game

[7:45:07] <meloshav> really though if the boss can 1 shot you with any move then you should level vit
[7:45:12] <+Nomenanza> finding 30 vit pretty comfy

[8:09:33] <%cascadepersona> Hehe, you ain't done kiddo
[8:09:35] <Zourath> @ScrapKingKeita There's a sorc spell you can get which completely cheeses it. Unfortunately, it's in the stinky swamp, locked behind a long quest.
[8:09:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> PHASE 2
[8:09:38] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Frostofthecwsw Yes!
[8:09:50] <%whyskeywolfe> she looks like Bayonetta's grandmother

[8:09:57] <+LandOfTheWay> THIS is why folks were worried about ranni
[8:09:58] <rosabellamelantha> So she made a Clone(?) of Ranni
[8:09:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[8:09:58] <$realm_forge> Lady your hat is stupid
[8:10:03] <penitentpendant> Hello Ranni!
[8:10:04] <T_Sasquatch> Im betting a 5 sec death in phase 2
[8:10:05] <kingra> Ranni <3
[8:10:06] <Maids4lyfe> oh it's big evil
[8:10:06] <ScottyScotch> This next part didn’t really make sense to me. I need to go back through these cutscenes with a list of names tbh

[8:10:21] <%SWFanatic> dumb hat brigade

[8:11:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> PermaDeath Game over
[8:11:40] <%JoshManVGH> You can Oleg in the moon room
[8:11:41] <neet98> very bloodborne

[8:11:53] <%xcompleasedad> 10/10
[8:11:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> What a Twist
[8:12:01] <+OurGuardianAngel> larrQuake
[8:12:08] <+OurGuardianAngel> larrKick
[8:12:10] <%cascadepersona> Pretty cool how Pat decided to play Endwalker this stream
[8:12:16] <MidnightPacif1c> SourPls
[8:12:19] <%Valdorick> @pi_in_the_sci Pat's gone so I'll say it. Its a recording of Ranni inside the Egg, not the one you're dealing with in the present.
[8:12:23] <%Valdorick> The Time Egg is fucky wucky
[8:12:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So wait....Is this really the witch lady we were helping?! Imagine never meeting her!
[8:12:33] <+OurGuardianAngel> vswedJam
[8:12:42] <RubberFistFight> @TurtlesAndTentacles No.
[8:12:43] <rosabellamelantha> nah it's like a clone or something?
[8:12:47] <rosabellamelantha> it's not the original
[8:12:47] <neet98> she's cool as hell though
[8:13:01] <RubberFistFight> it's just some magical bullshit
[8:13:08] <%FallenWard> lets clear the chat with random ongoings
[8:13:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @RubberFistFight My mind has been boggled!
[8:13:16] <%FallenWard> hide the spoilers
[8:13:22] <%BubbaRands> Kinda want that Rennala wallpaper now
[8:13:22] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I think its an illusion made by Ranni, idw
[8:13:29] <luciluxlu0> it's her mother
[8:13:36] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I love the Moon Dimension thing. Like youre legit in the same room but not
[8:13:43] <%Valdorick> psaRaffle Did psaRaffle Someone psaRaffle Say psaRaffle RAFFLE!? psaRaffle
[8:13:44] <%cade_calrayn> She's a brilliant reimagining of Rom the Vacuous Spider
[8:13:46] <+OurGuardianAngel> steveinSip
[8:13:51] <rosabellamelantha> Ranni's mom was basically just playing back the memory of her favourite child over and over because as far as rennala knows Ranni is "dead"
[8:13:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @luciluxlu0 Ahhhh that makes sense
[8:13:54] <%DianaTheAscian> What level is Pat btw?
[8:14:02] <%FunkyStreams> its so trippy, complex and cool.
[8:14:06] <%cade_calrayn> and yeah, we're fighting an illusion of Rennala made by Ranni
[8:14:08] <%FunkyStreams> and Japanese.
[8:14:12] <Zourath> @zaddyforever The spell you get there is the Elden Ring equivalent of Pestilent Mist, it completely bypasses her barrier.
[8:14:13] <%cade_calrayn> at least in Phase 2
[8:14:22] <fierysnowflakes> I'm gonna need Vaati to explain every single detail later on, because this shit is on crack
[8:14:24] <%OrangeMDT> Soooo is the idea to help Ranni and then kill her mom??
[8:14:24] <RubberFistFight> i kept stopping to take screenshots, the arenas so fucking beautiful
[8:14:25] <neet98> she's definitely a lot cooler for the moon background than Rom
[8:14:28] <RubberFistFight> and IT GETS BETTER
[8:14:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @cade_calrayn That is so cool!
[8:14:38] <+OurGuardianAngel> luxieUwu
[8:14:43] <RubberFistFight> @neet98 you ain't see the half of it yet
[8:14:51] <T_Sasquatch> Im just noticing the bell in this song
[8:14:54] <%Valdorick> Yes... "kill" Renalla...
[8:15:15] <%cade_calrayn> @TurtlesAndTentacles you've got phase 1 with all the little ones (the spiders) and then her in the lake arena with the moon using magic.. it's excellent
[8:15:23] <Glockroach2774> I'm living this game through Pat
[8:15:34] <rosabellamelantha> the fight really makes no sense if you're doing it for Ranni
[8:15:46] <%archangelishx> archangelishx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! love the content ever since SBFP hope that your career continues to prosper
[8:15:50] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @cade_calrayn Damn! This game is amazing
[8:16:05] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt did you notice that she's basically Rom the Vacuous Spider?
[8:16:07] <%Valdorick> I'm watching Pat while helping to reduce the local bird population to extinction for the good of the Golden Order or something...
[8:16:12] <ape_hawk> i believe in you pat
[8:16:18] <%Valdorick> I just want Gold-Pickled Bird Claws.
[8:16:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> up
[8:16:20] <@Spydurman> LUL
[8:16:21] <penitentpendant> @rosabellamelantha To 'keep appearances' seems to be the best explanation
[8:16:24] <%greasypete00> is this Raya lucaria? I've been gone a while
[8:16:30] <GhostPyre> yes
[8:16:34] <neet98> she look a lot better than Rom
[8:16:36] <RubberFistFight> @rosabellamelantha i mean ranni's questline goes for quite a while after this. im sure more will be revealed as you go on.
[8:16:38] <%SForlord> She's one of those aliens from Naruto
[8:16:39] <%Valdorick> Yes
[8:16:40] <%tyler274> YES
[8:16:40] <%sniffy77> you do
[8:16:40] <%JoshManVGH> Yep
[8:16:42] <@Spydurman> WOW LUL
[8:16:43] <%cade_calrayn> Yup
[8:16:44] <+LandOfTheWay> you do
[8:16:45] <%JoshManVGH> Every time
[8:16:46] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt got bad news for you buddy
[8:16:47] <%bevyrage> yes, every time
[8:16:47] <%tyler274> FROM DOESNT KNOW WHAT DOOR BOSS MEAMS
[8:16:47] <b_ikki> its really easy lol
[8:16:48] <%bilyso> I'm so sorry
[8:16:49] <%DashXero> Sorry.
[8:16:49] <%tyler274> and it sucks
[8:16:50] <%shootbang_exe> I think you do
[8:16:51] <@Spydurman> yes
[8:16:51] <%sniffy77> it doesn't take that long once you know what to do though
[8:16:55] <tolloponik> its pretty simple of a phase
[8:16:56] <%Valdorick> I won't tell you lies, Pat, I'm not a soap stone message.
[8:16:57] <+Nomenanza> I hope you do so that we can see that sick transition again
[8:16:57] <+chimaera24> Killing those guys stopped the ball so you can just run up there
[8:16:57] <@Spydurman> it sucks but yes
[8:16:57] <+hoenhime344> she naruto s greatgreatgreat grandmother
[8:17:10] <peachy996> No Pat in this souls game you can skip ahead to the second phase because the game is nice to you
[8:17:13] <%Valdorick> Wow, welcome to the fuck box
[8:17:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> I left because I was worried it would LUL
[8:17:15] <%JoshManVGH> This shortcut sucks!
[8:17:17] <+WeLucklessJacks> Yes, you have to.
[8:17:17] <%Felhad> it does not, promise
[8:17:18] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt it fucks it up if you didn't already start it
[8:17:20] <%Valdorick> This runback is AWFUL, by the way.
[8:17:25] <RubberFistFight> it seems that given the "open world" nature of the game they've untethered the questlines from stuff a bit.
[8:17:28] <joodatious> honestly the shortcut is way more dangerous
[8:17:28] <+hoenhime344> @peachy996 aaaahahhahahah
[8:17:29] <%Valdorick> It does not
[8:17:32] <RubberFistFight> there are no major world state changes really
[8:17:33] <joodatious> IT IS
[8:17:37] <%Valdorick> I did this first and got to Ranni's quest just fine
[8:17:38] <+Edrem> I never even met ranni and it didn't fuck it up
[8:17:41] <b_ikki> it doesnt do anything to the quest
[8:17:43] <+LandOfTheWay> AMAZING
[8:17:44] <%therustystream> I just run back up the stair case lol
[8:17:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[8:17:44] <%Valdorick> OH NO
[8:17:45] <@Spydurman> @PatStaresAt the ball path is way easier for future runs
[8:17:45] <%BubbaRands> LUL
[8:17:45] <+hoenhime344> omg
[8:17:47] <%Felhad> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[8:17:48] <joodatious> use the rolling ball runback its better
[8:17:48] <%therustystream> WHAT THE FUCK
[8:17:48] <SoaringTrumpet> hahahaha
[8:17:49] <KingKZ> nliFELL
[8:17:53] <Midnight188> you'll have to get Absolution to continue her story afterwards I'd imagine....
[8:17:53] <+chipsahoymcoy15> LMAO
[8:17:54] <%FunkyStreams> failue of the game design
[8:17:55] <+hoenhime344> clipped
[8:17:56] <@Spydurman> LMAO
[8:17:58] <rosabellamelantha> I had a friend need to absolve themselves after fighting Rennala so idk
[8:17:58] <kimchisunny> its honestly more efficient just running back the canon stairs
[8:17:59] <+theoldone001> The Crystal cave boss too, and that boss and area sucks
[8:18:01] <T_Sasquatch> A comedy of srrorsr
[8:18:02] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, Buns hadn't agreed to work with Ranni, so when we sent her to her yesterday after she'd already beaten Rennala, Ranni was just gone
[8:18:03] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> incredible play
[8:18:04] <haisho> how did you even
[8:18:07] <%JoshManVGH> If you hadn't started Rannis quest how does it get fucked up...?
[8:18:09] <17sevens> the answer to if it fucks it up or how is uncertain, people still figuring that kind of stuff out
[8:18:12] <GhostPyre> lmao
[8:18:13] <tolloponik> is there something under the elevator?
[8:18:20] <%JoshManVGH> Oh thank god
[8:18:21] <Zourath> Actually, I started Ranni's quest after the fight, and I had no problems. So I dunno.
[8:18:23] <RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch the fact that you typoed the shit out of that makes it that much better
[8:18:24] <neet98> this is the new bloodborne
[8:18:25] <T_Sasquatch> Elden bloodborne coming soon
[8:18:26] <+ATorL> this game has more eldrich horror than bloodborn so yeah
[8:18:36] <%Felhad> I also started the quest after
[8:18:39] <%shootbang_exe> eldenborne
[8:18:43] <%cade_calrayn> @JoshManVGH You're fighting Ranni in the second phase, so fighting her before you know her is gonna piss her off
[8:18:44] <@Spydurman> Elden Ring DLC: Bloodborne 2
[8:18:44] <%Valdorick> Its funny that guy is tied to the boulders
[8:18:46] <%JoshManVGH> By the time I got to her she was still there, I must have lucked out
[8:18:48] <+hoenhime344> ***
[8:18:50] <%Valdorick> becuase the boulders are how I killed him LUL
[8:18:52] <Ghufufin> i mean they could add a bloodbourne dlc for this
[8:18:59] <T_Sasquatch> @rubberfistfight totally did that on purpose Kappa
[8:19:00] <Kabron3> still cant decide to get it or not because of the pc performance
[8:19:04] <RubberFistFight> @cade_calrayn i thought it wasn't HER her though
[8:19:19] <%cade_calrayn> Pinwheel
[8:19:21] <neet98> it's deacon
[8:19:22] <+Nomenanza> oh the ones keeping the shield are singing
[8:19:26] <Midnight188> Deacons of the Deep
[8:19:28] <@Spydurman> Deacons
[8:19:29] <HotSauceFiend> a resource and health drain is what the first phase is
[8:19:32] <%shootbang_exe> vaati's gonna have content for years with this game
[8:19:35] <%Valdorick> Oh, there are 3, good.
[8:19:36] <%shootbang_exe> good for him
[8:19:37] <%cade_calrayn> @RubberFistFight it's a projection of Rennala made by Ranni, I think
[8:19:39] <RubberFistFight> yeah this is deacons crossed with rom
[8:19:39] <+hoenhime344> yea this is like the ultimate evolution of fools idol
[8:19:44] <%BlueLunecy> The speedruns of this game are gonna be lit
[8:19:45] <GhostPyre> puzzle is reaching big time
[8:19:46] <+chiazam> Holy shit all of these Elden Ring streams have been long huh
[8:19:49] <RubberFistFight> but done significantly better than both
[8:19:53] <joodatious> kill the kids pat do it
[8:19:56] <%Valdorick> What about the Congregation LUL
[8:20:01] <@Spydurman> damn you can almost do it in one
[8:20:02] <Gray_LoFi> I wonder if you can one cycle that break
[8:20:07] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt this isn't the doll though
[8:20:33] <neet98> the atmosphere here is great
[8:20:37] <+Nomenanza> cool it uses objects to throw at you also
[8:20:39] <joodatious> funny how pats having a harder time at this fight then me and he's pretty overleveled
[8:20:40] <bassoontyphoon> God are they singing”frere Jacques”
[8:20:43] <+alphonseisbest> wait does the doll and the Maiden in black share a VA?
[8:20:47] <neet98> it's the right amount of creepy
[8:20:57] <+Nomenanza> @alphonseisbest yes
[8:20:57] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt nope. Doll is Evetta Muradasilova, this is Mali Harries.
[8:21:07] <%JoshManVGH> Oleg time?
[8:21:10] <+hoenhime344> maiden in black is my favorite waifu
[8:21:18] <%epide> you can summon a helper and it carrys to other stages
[8:21:20] <+hoenhime344> idk demons souls just hits differnt
[8:21:21] <bassoontyphoon> 0leg
[8:21:27] <joodatious> lol
[8:21:28] <%Valdorick> Well, if you die again, don't forget you can pop a rune arc.
[8:21:31] <RubberFistFight> This one DOES have an accent, but it's Welsh.
[8:21:32] <KingKZ> Effortless dodge
[8:21:33] <%DashXero> She seems to love lightning.
[8:21:33] <darce_avidson> wolves fuck her up in phase 2
[8:21:34] <penitentpendant> Good ole majestic slow but deadly projectiles
[8:21:36] <+spartanghost004> Holy shit
[8:21:38] <joodatious> she oises ib yiy
[8:21:39] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt don't try to out-magic the magic boss?
[8:21:41] <+Nomenanza> zoner matchup
[8:21:43] <%Valdorick> Idealy outside the boss room; fuck that run up
[8:21:45] <RubberFistFight> like literally 5/6 of the characters in this game, for some reason.
[8:21:45] <darce_avidson> legit stunlock
[8:21:48] <+alphonseisbest> the Doll is my favorite from Waifu
[8:21:52] <mortificent> I just got here, is this final boss??
[8:21:53] <RubberFistFight> they went super heavy on the welsh voice actors.
[8:21:54] <joodatious> magic no good
[8:21:56] <+chiazam> Oh I have seen things I WAS NOT MEANT TO SEE
[8:21:58] <%therustystream> smack her in the face
[8:22:00] <+chiazam> I need to leave
[8:22:06] <%therustystream> @mortificent FUCK NO LOL
[8:22:09] <%FunkyStreams> this is almost like a version of Deacons that is actually difficult.
[8:22:10] <RubberFistFight> Iji probably has the heaviest accent.
[8:22:14] <joodatious> yeah honestly
[8:22:20] <+alphonseisbest> idk
[8:22:20] <peachy996> This is Nashandra
[8:22:22] <mortificent> LOL
[8:22:23] <penitentpendant> Yeah, 'Domain Expansion' usually equals 'Final Boss'
[8:22:23] <%cade_calrayn> yeah, you've fought, like, what, 40 bosses already?
[8:22:24] <neet98> NOT EVEN CLOSE
[8:22:25] <peachy996> But done right
[8:22:26] <joodatious> this is the second main boss
[8:22:27] <Wobuzhidao> How the fuck did Fromsoft afford to make this game
[8:22:29] <RubberFistFight> @FunkyStreams it's DeaconsXRom but done better
[8:22:32] <%sniffy77> After this you'd be 2/6
[8:22:35] <%JoshManVGH> It's the wooooorst
[8:22:40] <joodatious> Nashandra looks like a mini boss compared to this
[8:22:51] <+Nomenanza> and then there is another 50% of the game probably
[8:22:55] <+alphonseisbest> she'd be the half way point in Most games
[8:23:00] <%JoshManVGH> "Fought"
[8:23:02] <%greasypete00> that WHAT?
[8:23:03] <%FunkyStreams> Australia?
[8:23:07] <+Ravenian96> Technically super space hell
[8:23:09] <+alphonseisbest> KORNE
[8:23:10] <@Spydurman> da devil
[8:23:16] <+chiazam> FROM WHERE
[8:23:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> He war from Ney York?!
[8:23:18] <+chiazam> WHAT
[8:23:20] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @Nomenanza More like 70% more
[8:23:26] <SatansDelight> like with the fire and eternal suffering?
[8:23:26] <+hoenhime344> how much simgle target does the dragon breath do?
[8:23:31] <penitentpendant> From Joisey?
[8:23:33] <tolloponik> he held no runes he's like from an entirely different faction of people
[8:23:35] <%FunkyStreams> you get hit by that once and you've lost the entire fight, practically.
[8:23:39] <fierysnowflakes> That was less fighting, and more "getting instantly gibbed"
[8:23:39] <RubberFistFight> Tour Guide Nixon got anything to say about the devil?
[8:23:45] <%epide> wwait nixon?
[8:23:50] <%therustystream> dude I've done godrick and this and like nothing else
[8:23:56] <RubberFistFight> he was the Saytan
[8:23:56] <%FunkyStreams> like Nixon?
[8:23:58] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> He also had a devil pitchfork
[8:24:05] <+LandOfTheWay> what armor is pat wearing? it looks cool as hell
[8:24:06] <%JoshManVGH> And it was a Tim Curry kinda devil too
[8:24:06] <%sniffy77> pat look at the books
[8:24:09] <Manwad> what do you mean omega satan is in this game
[8:24:14] <%shootbang_exe> must have missed that one, sounds neat
[8:24:14] <+RedMaskBandit> u fought demons, dragons, angels and other abyssnal shit throughout the series.
[8:24:16] <%Valdorick> Soul level 1 will be damn near impossible in this game. I eagerly await LobosJr.'s Naked, Punching, Soul Level 1, fat rolling playthrough on a DDR PAD that controls a Donkey Kong Bongo controller all bosses speedrun deathless.
[8:24:21] <%therustystream> those books
[8:24:24] <%cade_calrayn> Reading is for NERDS
[8:24:29] <RubberFistFight> there will be no free reading in this library
[8:24:29] <+ScrapKingKeita> only the singing one throws books
[8:24:30] <%JoshManVGH> The projectile books
[8:24:40] <@Spydurman> yup
[8:24:43] <T_Sasquatch> Books ?
[8:24:45] <+seaearthandsky> so I figured how to kill the big fucked up thing in the ant cave with melee
[8:24:50] <@Spydurman> only the target one does books
[8:24:50] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> No we told you and you were ready to be mean to chat
[8:24:57] <APsaull> Pat discovers the power of reading
[8:24:59] <%therustystream> @T_Sasquatch they throw books
[8:25:16] <%therustystream> nerds
[8:25:23] <T_Sasquatch> @therustystream i thought they all threw books
[8:25:32] <fierysnowflakes> Oleg time me thinks?
[8:25:33] <+hoenhime344> ring ring
[8:25:36] <Midnight188> take 3
[8:25:38] <%therustystream> nope just the one you need to hit
[8:25:38] <bassoontyphoon> Oleg time
[8:25:49] <penitentpendant> Moon
[8:25:51] <+hoenhime344> 21 HA
[8:25:51] <%DashXero> "Let's dance, boys!"
[8:25:52] <%Valdorick> Oleg too stornk for this. This is a job for shitsquad
[8:25:54] <%JoshManVGH> Aww no Oleg?
[8:25:54] <+LandOfTheWay> Moon Spirit Bomb
[8:25:56] <+polothegreatest> the shadows remains cast
[8:25:57] <RubberFistFight> BY THE POWER OF THE MOON
[8:26:02] <%zarkazeon> you can summon on phase 1 and they persist into phase 2.
[8:26:11] <+hoenhime344> gang
[8:26:13] <T_Sasquatch> That bleed
[8:26:14] <+wizard_of_diamonds> You can do it Pat, I believe in you
[8:26:14] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Oleg its better for this one too
[8:26:15] <+chiazam> OUGH
[8:26:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> FUG
[8:26:16] <%MartinOfLoxley> Greedy
[8:26:18] <%cade_calrayn> Bayonetta's mom says fuck you, Pat
[8:26:18] <%Valdorick> Unless they fucking DIE
[8:26:19] <TwistParabola> IN THE NAME OF THE MOON, I'LL KILL YOU
[8:26:20] <HotSauceFiend> you look like you just need more health
[8:26:21] <%whyskeywolfe> Need to pump that vigor broh
[8:26:21] <rosabellamelantha> OLEG
[8:26:22] <Midnight188> "so anyways I became the moon to dab on the Tarnished"
[8:26:22] <+hakumaribo> i feel they would die before phase 1 ended
[8:26:25] <%shootbang_exe> oleg?
[8:26:25] <+Nomenanza> I like how the dudes can beat the shit out of her even as she is trashtalking
[8:26:30] <+hoenhime344> oleg gonna get that ass
[8:26:30] <%DashXero> Oleg. Oleg. Oleg....
[8:26:30] <%strakillias> Do that before you kill the last shit kid
[8:26:30] <%therustystream> this is the run
[8:26:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> GIVE ME A O
[8:26:32] <+Vigonept> OLEG OLEG OLEG!
[8:26:33] <%cascadepersona> Oleg
[8:26:33] <RubberFistFight> Fighting evil by moonlight, winning love by daylight, never running from a real fight, she is the one named Sailor Moon!
[8:26:34] <fierysnowflakes> OLEG OLEG OLEG
[8:26:34] <@Spydurman> OLEG TIME
[8:26:34] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> you already cheating on Oleg
[8:26:38] <MidnightPacif1c> broleg
[8:26:39] <spinningchurro> does this game have a Solaire?
[8:26:40] <@Spydurman> OLEG OLEG OLEG
[8:26:41] <%JoshManVGH> @twistparabola LUL
[8:26:43] <bassoontyphoon> Jellyfish!
[8:26:52] <%OrangeMDT> The noble sorcerer?
[8:26:58] <%greasypete00> yeah
[8:27:06] <T_Sasquatch> Yes
[8:27:07] <%Valdorick> Sweaty assholes are already saying that
[8:27:08] <%FunkyStreams> magic is cheating
[8:27:08] <roguemephilesclone> I'm waitin' for something special in that fight...
[8:27:09] <+Nomenanza> spirits are ESSENTIAL now
[8:27:09] <morkelebmink> yep
[8:27:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Magic is cheating
[8:27:12] <+hakumaribo> and i say who cares, it helps me get thru this game
[8:27:13] <%whyskeywolfe> Imagine gatekeeping videogames
[8:27:14] <%greasypete00> how many spell slots do oyu have now
[8:27:14] <+Noelle808> leveling up is cheating
[8:27:15] <tolloponik> some people say that
[8:27:15] <%cascadepersona> Let me have my stands
[8:27:15] <ohno58> I feel like they balanced the bosses based on the assumption that you would be summoning.
[8:27:16] <%JoshManVGH> Not playing it MY way is cheating
[8:27:16] <TwistParabola> they already do!
[8:27:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Do you even need to build for ash summons, like with stat requirements? Or are they just something that every single character will have?
[8:27:19] <Ghufufin> look if u play differently than i do, its totally cheating
[8:27:19] <%DashXero> A win is indeed a win.
[8:27:19] <+dougtert> its the most a win is a win is a win souls-game ever
[8:27:21] <%JohnAtDawn> YEP
[8:27:22] <tanarath> Jellyfish is broken af
[8:27:22] <MidnightPacif1c> SMOrc
[8:27:23] <joodatious> i've seen people say that because magic is now useful
[8:27:23] <+FZeroDMX> People always said that spells are cheating
[8:27:24] <vicar_anat> ONLY STRAIGHT SWORD AND SHIELD...which is what im doing....
[8:27:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> you're cheating on Oleg by using other Summons lol
[8:27:26] <%sniffy77> If you wanted to you could summon and use ashes for each boss and breeze through the game.
[8:27:28] <ratearth> eho care it's cool to have little guys
[8:27:28] <TwistParabola> I've seen some people say magic builds are wayyy too opp
[8:27:29] <%tetraes> bUt SpeLls ArE  CheAtIng oNly MelEE matters
[8:27:32] <Cigwynn> I can only imagine the ScrubQuotes gang getting flooded with DS ones
[8:27:34] <darkelfdebauchery> scythes are cheating
[8:27:34] <joodatious> magic IS cheating and i approve
[8:27:34] <Explodincatz> hacking the game is fair game
[8:27:35] <fierysnowflakes> Imagine playing videogames
[8:27:35] <17sevens> yeah honestly weapon upgrades are cheating i don't understand why you'd even bother to play the game at that point
[8:27:35] <+Maleicus> dodging is cheating, just take the hit coward
[8:27:36] <penitentpendant> The restrictions make it fair. Only 1 summon per rest, FP requirement which means stat investment.
[8:27:37] <Midnight188> everything but barehand parry only is cheating when you think about it
[8:27:39] <T_Sasquatch> I've played enough souls that i know i don't like scraping by with a win
[8:27:40] <%JoshManVGH> Using left stick is cheating
[8:27:41] <%Valdorick> and also that you should only use the club and be naked all the time (ignoring that fast rolling is objectively better than using heavy armor and fat rolling)
[8:27:43] <+Nomenanza> wouldnt have been able to do some fights because some bosses are so fucking aggressive you need a summon to distract them every now and then
[8:27:43] <%pinkslimegoblin> I got a boss stuck by knocking it down during the transition attack a win is a win
[8:27:44] <%cade_calrayn> damn Pat just out here MURDERING children
[8:27:48] <+RedMaskBandit> or literal summoning since its the trade off.
[8:27:50] <+twenty112> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Stronger ones cost more FP
[8:27:55] <T_Sasquatch> It's just not fun summoning personally
[8:28:13] <%OrangeMDT> I love this game cause I can over level and still feel like I’m being challenged

[8:33:02] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Its my favorite fight
[8:33:02] <FourLeafLover> it's a spectacle
[8:33:04] <+ScrapKingKeita> I heard Radahn is either super hard, or a cake walk
[8:33:07] <HyperionXV> It's absurd but great
[8:33:09] <+Kyma1020> Radahn's fight is both absurd and amazing
[8:33:09] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt his fight is thematically fucking incredible and should be absolutely hype, but the execution is terrrriiiibblllleee
[8:33:09] <+alphonseisbest> ITS COOL AS FUCK
[8:33:10] <+dougtert> I finally beat Radahn today and BRO ITS SO SICK
[8:33:14] <Meekest> Woolie's LP is literally going to be 300 parts
[8:33:14] <%raggedwharfrat> There's a cheese if you don't wanna put up with his bullshit
[8:33:14] <+alphonseisbest> its what it is
[8:33:15] <joodatious> Radahns fight is lore accurate lets put it at that
[8:33:18] <%tyler274> there are 5? bosses ive found where its "too much"
[8:33:22] <%JoshManVGH> I have no idea how to even engage with Radahn! it's an insane premise of a fight
[8:33:24] <%Zeroblazex> I’ve seen people say he’s Gael 2.0
[8:33:24] <CH3F015> it's hard but possible. i just beat it
[8:33:25] <+Kyma1020> You have to throw everything you have and the kitchen sink to take that boy down
[8:33:33] <%tyler274> well past the point of being an enjoyable souls boss, and just tedious
[8:33:37] <+twenty112> Redahn's fight is 100% a final boss in any other game
[8:33:38] <darkelfdebauchery> Oleg doing combos on the younglings
[8:33:40] <+LandOfTheWay> i love his fight, but if you don't use everything available to your advantage it's a nightmare

[8:36:40] <%tyler274> gl
[8:36:42] <+LandOfTheWay> not sure what the lore reason is, but rennala's clearly not all there
[8:36:43] <%greasypete00> did you get the gesture from the fingers
[8:36:46] <TheBlankAce> Don't forget about that teleport you skipped before the boss as well
[8:36:47] <%JoshManVGH> Oh her gear has some fucking requirements.

[8:37:30] <%cade_calrayn> Off to the Capital!
[8:37:32] <+LandOfTheWay> @JustTheGuyYouNeed oh my god that actually makes sense
[8:37:32] <%greasypete00> true ending probably requires all runes
[8:37:32] <RubberFistFight> it doesn't close it out
[8:37:33] <dan_g_v> the other three are for the three fingers?
[8:37:36] <%Valdorick> You're about to find out, from her boss gear
[8:37:36] <+hoenhime344> im ehhh, ima say it. this game is a masterpiece. on the level of mgs3 and hades.

[8:37:47] <tolloponik> 3
[8:37:50] <dybia> You can get all the way to leyndell without any great runes

[8:39:17] <mkat64> Is there anyone front the uk here
[8:39:30] <TwistParabola> i'd suggest talking to Gideon too
[8:39:31] <ItsEzKill> lets just say that ladylikes those fingers for a reason
[8:39:37] <%Monkeyweed21> @MartinOfLoxley what makes you think you wont get 70 int by the end of this game
[8:39:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Im glad Im playin Int Dex
[8:39:42] <%cade_calrayn> @MartinOfLoxley no, considering the game length, that's just late game for 60/70 INT
[8:39:47] <penitentpendant> Oh, SHE did it
[8:39:58] <%MartinOfLoxley> Ahh, ok
[8:39:58] <+StallionPupper> ive been missing some chunks of the streams sadly. Did pat ever beat that guy here that was SUPER strong?
[8:40:00] <rosabellamelantha> Ok but WHY did she shatter it
[8:40:01] <tanarath> @martinofloxley velyndra has gotten to 73 int without finishing the game
[8:40:22] <%JoshManVGH> Did you ever talk to the Turtle Pope about Rennala?
[8:40:23] <%cade_calrayn> uh.... so they want to chain us up in the tree?
[8:40:26] <%Monkeyweed21> NOW IM THE NEW HUSBAND
[8:40:26] <digaogrunge> The cutscene seems to indicate so
[8:40:26] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> YEAH GET THAT BOMB MERIKA
[8:40:34] <%sniffy77> Plot of the game: Kill everything to get wife
[8:40:37] <peachy996> you're nuts
[8:40:42] <%epide> sooo what do ya think the queen looks like?
[8:40:43] <%sniffy77> ear book guy
[8:40:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> That's a first
[8:40:45] <%greasypete00> gideon is the office man
[8:40:46] <Carlioo> good thing you're sane pat
[8:40:50] <%whyskeywolfe> Gideon is the old guy in the library
[8:40:50] <mkat64> Nutty
[8:40:56] <+theoldone001> So is the wolf head guy just a reference to Rob Stark after the Red Wedding?
[8:40:57] <TwistParabola> the study guy
[8:40:58] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Wait, wasn't dung eater one of the dudes literally from the intro? what's he just doing chillin?
[8:40:58] <vVAstrAVv> think about wife
[8:41:00] <%strakillias> Dungeater probably has a lot to say about Melee
[8:41:01] <+LandOfTheWay> i thought "The Shattering" referred to the war between the demigods, not the elden ring breaking
[8:41:02] <+Kyma1020> Gideon Ofnir. THE ALL KNOWING
[8:41:10] <RubberFistFight> this guy's an ass
[8:41:26] <mkat64> @theoldone001 considering GRRM helped write it possibly
[8:41:28] <neet98> Gideon is cool
[8:41:38] <fierysnowflakes> OR kill everyone else!
[8:41:43] <FourLeafLover> eatin shit
[8:41:44] <spinningchurro> The narrator does a great job in the intro cinematic.
[8:41:46] <RubberFistFight> @neet98 he super is not, if you follow Neph's questline
[8:41:52] <%whyskeywolfe> He's still English.
[8:42:03] <%AyotoCorp> There's one coming up soon
[8:42:05] <dybia> Where's D?
[8:42:13] <%greasypete00> dismounter is a curved greatsword
[8:42:16] <RubberFistFight> @dybia D's dead
[8:42:17] <+tizziks> is the Dismounter unique?
[8:42:17] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @dybia super dead
[8:42:20] <%greasypete00> isnt it
[8:42:21] <spinningchurro> Wait so the ppl in the intro cinematic aren’t all bosses?
[8:42:21] <+LandOfTheWay> @dybia dead
[8:42:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Somber smithing stones are NOT rare in this game
[8:42:23] <+spencer_zero> Hello, Pat and friends!
[8:42:26] <%OrangeMDT> Dismounted seems to be the baseline
[8:42:34] <%OrangeMDT> Dismounter
[8:42:40] <+ScrapKingKeita> Dismounter drops from field enemies though, doesn't it?
[8:42:43] <dybia> Ok, pat did that hten. I haven't been watching pat play.
[8:42:43] <+TheBitingIrish> lol, I have several
[8:42:44] <%DashXero> But you can get so many dismounters.
[8:42:45] <penitentpendant> Yeah, more END
[8:42:45] <roguemephilesclone> Earlier, someone suggested another door in here has opened. Maybe people have moved into the back middle or right rooms.
[8:42:46] <neet98> @RubberFistFight he looked cool at least, i like his armour
[8:42:50] <+tizziks> ok didn't know.  I thought you looted ssecond one, but I am wrong
[8:42:53] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Monkeyweed21 somber smithing stones feel more common than regular ones at this point
[8:42:53] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I'll say that leveling unique weapons are easier on this game than the normal ones
[8:42:56] <%Chex868> i have 3 dismounters
[8:43:03] <%greasypete00> dismounter drops from the horse guys
[8:43:04] <+dougtert> did Pat end up getting the sword of Night and Flame? I just respecced to use it and it's the most overpowered thing i've ever seen in a souls game
[8:43:04] <%whyskeywolfe> no, you can get a million
[8:43:10] <%Monkeyweed21> it uses regular smithing stones and you can change its art of war iirc
[8:43:21] <+pabloelenano2> yeah dismounter is not unique
[8:43:26] <roguemephilesclone> No, I don't think Dismounter is unique. It's just the name of a use for a big sword.
[8:43:29] <penitentpendant> +1 to Chat
[8:43:32] <digaogrunge> Give the extra key to the bald dude in the church? He should appear/come to the Academy @PatStaresAt
[8:43:35] <roguemephilesclone> Dis-MOUNT.
[8:43:42] <vVAstrAVv> you can tell a weapons unkque by whether theres a skill box next to the weapon image
[8:43:55] <%OrangeMDT> Don’t think them having an innate skill necessarily equals unique
[8:44:00] <%JoshManVGH> You also got a magic sword key still
[8:44:12] <roguemephilesclone> You are now playing as one of those Ring Knights from the Ringed City DLC. Approoriate.
[8:44:14] <TwistParabola> oh I'm doing a dual curved greatsword run right now! it's very sick and can melt most things that bleed
[8:44:31] <%whyskeywolfe> kaboomy
[8:44:33] <bassoontyphoon> Also what about the teleporter beneath the Boulder dumping spot
[8:44:50] <%Cynical2DD> After listening to the podcast I decided to buy Elden Ring so im not lost next podcast
[8:44:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> Turning his back on god for a fire Sword
[8:44:53] <+theoldone001> More than half of Caelid is still undiscovered for me but I somehow got to Radahn and he's kicking my ass. That area really ramps up the difficulty.
[8:44:53] <neet98> he do the move every boss with a machete do
[8:44:53] <%xcompleasedad> What stats do you need to make that work?
[8:45:05] <milkandcreamer> aren't dual wielding str weapons counter intuitive though? you don't get the two handed str buff afaik
[8:45:27] <%sniffy77> Bruh its filled with creepy shit
[8:45:27] <allbrancook> He will be outside the schoolroom grace
[8:45:31] <%FunkyStreams> ^no shutup tho
[8:45:31] <ohno58> now kill him
[8:45:35] <+hoenhime344> but it looks so cool
[8:45:38] <%Cynical2DD> Not now tho, I just bought TOkimeki Memorial
[8:45:40] <+theoldone001> So all the magicians at the academy are women, but this is the only dude. WTf is up with that.

[8:45:49] <tolloponik> Plague?!
[8:45:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ded
[8:45:59] <%cade_calrayn> @theoldone001 who says they're all women?
[8:46:03] <fierysnowflakes> He's gonna be turned into a weird baby man isn't he?
[8:46:04] <%SveriSageAdvice> yes
[8:46:06] <%SveriSageAdvice> schoolhouse
[8:46:07] <%Cynical2DD> School of ROck
[8:46:11] <spinningchurro> Yay now he can go back and study and achieve his dream! Good for him.

[8:46:54] <%cade_calrayn> @Dudealy a long trek over the rooftops, accessible from one of the side staircases on the big top courtyard
[8:46:58] <+theoldone001> @cade_calrayn when you kill them they scream like women, all the ones in Renalla's room are women. The paintings in the academy show older magician dudes who the masks are modeled after.
[8:47:00] <TheBlankAce> There's also a teleporter you skipped in the school right before the boss
[8:47:02] <%Valdorick> He ded
[8:47:04] <vVAstrAVv> yes lift

[8:47:46] <+pabloelenano2> fang
[8:47:46] <+ATorL> he died doing what he loved. Sitting in a chair.
[8:47:46] <DrBadyear> bloodhound looks cooler
[8:47:48] <$SGrim> @Kevlar_Caviar Tried tapping the witch's lunussy and croaked.
[8:47:49] <+chiazam> Bloodhound Fang
[8:47:50] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> bloodhound for the bleed
[8:47:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Bloodhound Fang
[8:47:50] <+Dudealy> @cade_calrayn thanks 👍
[8:47:51] <spinningchurro> @kevlar_caviar cuz he went into an academy full of homicidal maniacs.
[8:47:54] <%DashXero> Which looks cooler?
[8:47:54] <+dougtert> bloodhound fang's bleed is incredibly good
[8:47:55] <+StallionPupper> bloodhound
[8:47:55] <%Monkeyweed21> fang is really good
[8:47:58] <+hoenhime344> EVERYONE and theor mother is using bloodhound fang
[8:48:00] <Midnight188> Bloodhound
[8:48:01] <+twenty112> Fang for BIG BLEEDS
[8:48:03] <%HexLotus> I vote bloodhound
[8:48:06] <@Spydurman> the cool looking one
[8:48:07] <%FunkyStreams> bloodhound looks way better for your current fashion.
[8:48:08] <Namillus> He died at his desk tho
[8:48:13] <%xcompleasedad> Bloodhound, because it has better scaling
[8:48:17] <+hoenhime344> but EVERYONE is using the fang
[8:48:25] <vVAstrAVv> bleed fucks in this game
[8:48:28] <neet98> LUL
[8:48:29] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Bloodhound fang is also incredibly busted
[8:48:35] <+dearghostss> he was too stupid for the magic
[8:48:37] <+ATorL> they're using it because it's cool
[8:48:39] <lilmac64> Of course everyone's using it. It looks sick as fuck.

[8:53:52] <jumpyhugs> oh, still good to know
[8:53:53] <+theoldone001> Apparently in lore, being reborn makes you weaker in the long run which is why those girls were all crawling around.

[8:56:20] <%xcompleasedad> 100 FP= Oleg
[8:56:22] <digaogrunge> Reduce Fatih for now, drop frozen lighting
[8:56:23] <%JoshManVGH> Especially if you're using the beast cast thing right?
[8:56:25] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Blood dagger seems like an early game killer but I feel like there are probably better faith weapons in the ong run
[8:56:25] <tanarath> @turtlesandtentacles mind

[9:00:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> Faithless Plus No Lightning Plus not a Paladin

[9:00:52] <$realm_forge> Pat just hollowed out
[9:01:03] <%RealThiele> yea i prefer the bloodhound to this so far
[9:01:36] <+hoenhime344> @RealThiele seems like everyone and their mother does too
[9:01:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> high calcium alpha boneman
[9:01:45] <+Maleicus> yeah that happens
[9:01:49] <+twenty112> Maybe resistant to fire?
[9:01:50] <+theoldone001> These guys have no armor though
[9:01:51] <mkat64> Anyone else it’s GMT and it’s bedtime for them lmao
[9:01:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Skeletons resist slashing
[9:02:00] <jumpyhugs> bones don't burn, maybe
[9:02:04] <%pinkslimegoblin> did you find the illusory walls here?
[9:02:22] <+alphonseisbest> @mkat64 dude its like 7am i am sleep
[9:02:23] <tanarath> The Skeleton never gave up
[9:02:23] <%strakillias> Blood Sword requires one more Dex I think
[9:02:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> how is that so good
[9:02:32] <$SGrim> First hot is free!?
[9:02:37] <$SGrim> hit*
[9:02:40] <+hakumaribo> are you not losing stamina on the first swing?
[9:02:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> does it only drain if you hit?
[9:02:48] <+hoenhime344> why is it not using stam for some swings?
[9:02:51] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The weapon art on this thing seems like it'd be some kind of killer on any target that's stationary
[9:02:55] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the bloodhound fang art is also great
[9:02:57] <neet98> first swing free?
[9:02:57] <ohno58> wombo combo
[9:03:00] <%pinkslimegoblin> no stamina use when not in combat
[9:03:00] <RubberFistFight> get riggedy rekt
[9:03:02] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> just dump a big ol pit of magma on someone's feet, what the fuck are they gonna do?
[9:03:05] <peachy996> LOL
[9:03:05] <ohno58> happy feet
[9:03:06] <+pabloelenano2> you are not loosing stamina on the first hit
[9:03:06] <%MartinOfLoxley> The Burger Kings ruled
[9:03:08] <$MinoMiushi> First hit is free since you aren't considered in combat yet
[9:03:09] <+theoldone001> I think it takes stamina in one big chunk than with each swing
[9:03:09] <vVAstrAVv> stmina only drains in combat ppl
[9:03:09] <tolloponik> when the nerds bully back
[9:03:12] <Baeltyr> its not using stam on swing that your arent "in combat" for
[9:03:18] <peachy996> Pot was just making sure you were ded
[9:03:19] <+Vigonept> it looked like the first hit was free
[9:03:19] <%greasypete00> its because you dont lose stamina out of combat so you arent losing stamina until they notice you
[9:03:20] <%JoshManVGH> lol the pot dude slamming in from off screen
[9:03:20] <+hoenhime344> why no stamila loss on some swings?
[9:03:38] <morkelebmink> yeah that's beastly
[9:03:38] <+hoenhime344> @greasypete00 ummmm is that true?
[9:03:38] <a_mad_dragon_> so is this game bigger than all three dark souls put together?
[9:03:46] <%Monkeyweed21> it does more damage than a backstab
[9:03:47] <MidnightPacif1c> schmovin
[9:03:49] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> the second hit is also has invincibility frames
[9:03:54] <revolver_robe> a question if that is all right: how many hours in is Pat now in the game? It looks like he has found some cool equipement :)
[9:03:59] <jumpyhugs> granq
[9:04:01] <Baeltyr> @hoenhime344  because he wasnt "in combat" the other enemies hadnt noticed him
[9:04:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> Did you ever calm the Beast Boy down
[9:04:05] <%greasypete00> @greasypete00 you can run around and swing out of combat for no stamina cost
[9:04:07] <+theoldone001> @a_mad_dragon_ This feels bigger than all 3 games combined.
[9:04:12] <%RealThiele> great grind spot
[9:04:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> ahh, the ol family farm
[9:04:16] <%Valdorick> Wait, Pat hasn't grabbed the bridge bonfire here?
[9:04:17] <%Monkeyweed21> Did pat give gurranq the 4th deathroot?
[9:04:41] <+hoenhime344> @Baeltyr i really dontthink thats true. because people test out combos to see if they have the stam to do them
[9:04:47] <+hakumaribo> the beast spells are pretty freaking cool though
[9:04:56] <+theoldone001> Is it me or is the roundtable area looking shittier as the game goes along?
[9:05:13] <+hakumaribo> especially the ones for finishing the deathroot crap.
[9:05:39] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I find it weird that the weapon art is also listed on the weapon upgrade screen as though it could change on upgrade
[9:05:46] <+hoenhime344> huh
[9:05:46] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> fck
[9:05:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> damn
[9:05:49] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> use the R2 combo
[9:05:52] <Baeltyr> @hoenhime344 yes, and that only works in combat now, as there is no stam drain out of combat
[9:05:55] <+hoenhime344> i guess 1st swing is always free
[9:06:02] <%RealThiele> BIG
[9:06:02] <+hoenhime344> @Baeltyr interesting
[9:06:14] <+chiazam> why did it take him so long to attack
[9:06:28] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> having a unique weapon that got a different weapon art for being leveled enough sounds cool
[9:06:47] <+theoldone001> I mean it hits hard, but with how mobile bosses are its really too slow for my liking.
[9:06:51] <Baeltyr> @hoenhime344 its jsut really noticeable on these single large enemies
[9:06:55] <+hoenhime344> @Baeltyr so the only way to see if you have the stam to do things is to actually land hits?
[9:07:35] <Baeltyr> @hoenhime344 as long as they are aware of you, so youre targeted by an enemy you should have stamina drain
[9:07:45] <+chiazam> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Is that a weapon?
[9:08:00] <APsaull> Do all weapons do that thing where you can dodge out of a charged attack?
[9:08:06] <+theoldone001> Wait how do you buy regular smith stones? Ive yet been able to buy them
[9:08:26] <sirrice77> @theoldone001 you need to get the bell bearings from certain bosses
[9:09:07] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Oh, no, I have no clue whatsoever, I'm just saying it would be cool, based on seeing the weapon art listed twice on the upgrade screen as though an upgrade could change it. Zero clue, though
[9:09:09] <roguemephilesclone> Oh, you have a Golden Seed, I think.
[9:09:18] <+FZeroDMX> The bosses to buy the stones are in caves
[9:09:21] <+hoenhime344> @Baeltyr thanks... that seems like a bug though.
[9:09:48] <%FunkyStreams> @PatStaresAt you've been going for 9hrs, now.
[9:09:51] <+hoenhime344> @Baeltyr maybe not a bug... but atl east exploitable
[9:10:05] <Baeltyr> @hoenhime344 honestly i think it is aswell, but they did want to have no stam drain out of combat
[9:10:10] <%dasmause> this thunder magic is kinda meh
[9:10:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> Lightning Nerfed
[9:10:15] <%OrangeMDT> Pat go to sleep so I can
[9:10:32] <Baeltyr> @hoenhime344 oh yea at the very least, incredibly exploitable
[9:11:05] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I feel like any boss where you would WANT to exploit it, you won't be able to
[9:11:12] <digaogrunge> You can go do the tutorial boss also
[9:11:15] <+theoldone001> Dont weapons go beyond 15 now?
[9:11:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> @theoldone001 They go to 25.
[9:11:38] <+pabloelenano2> it wont
[9:11:39] <+theoldone001> Bellfry unlocks tutorial area
[9:11:53] <Baeltyr> @Hunk_Of_Dunk  oh i dont think you could exploit bosses with this stam thing, as they target you when entering their arenas
[9:11:55] <digaogrunge> I though you unlocked it, no spolils
[9:12:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Blood Spiller is a Spawn villian
[9:12:22] <%bevyrage> the lowest/first belfry tower unlocks tutorial. dunno about the other two
