[0:05:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> I had the same feeling when I beat PS4G recently
[0:05:38] <%Lion_kun> I worry about the remake because if they rebalance it too much, the game will lose some of its charm. I liked how some of the rings and magic were horribly busted.
[0:05:48] <@mothmandraws> its civlians in 40k
[0:05:48] <%Guardiansaiyan> is this game okay?

[0:22:44] <%BinaryFireball> it is
[0:22:47] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> I believe Necromunda is technically separate from 40k
[0:22:49] <@SSaryn> @StridentSong a cool
[0:22:52] <%thebonebard> ye it a warhammer
[0:22:52] <huskarl_zap> It has the official product icon
[0:22:54] <%Jeemukun> Necromunda is a 40k specialist game
[0:22:55] <%ChestMimik> @valriot Always has been
[0:22:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The content is in the back next to Skelmo, I think
[0:22:58] <+deviljhojho_> necromunda is part of the same universe
[0:22:59] <%thebonebard> about scum gangs
[0:23:02] <%Jeemukun> like battlefleet gothic
[0:23:02] <%BinaryFireball> Necromunda is 40k for all the normal folk of the grim dank universe
[0:23:07] <%D00msDayDan> they probably didn't put the 40k logo on it because it's so far removed from mainstream 40k, if it said 40k people would be like where's all the space mareens and orkz
[0:23:09] <+TDotGoat> !necro
[0:23:09] <+RICE02> Is this Battlesword 20k?

[0:23:10] <huskarl_zap> Necromunda is a planet in the 40k universe
[0:23:11] <%BinaryFireball> so no spec murrines
[0:23:12] <Them00n> Hi Pat just wanted to say you're a bitch and you won't see this ok bye.
[0:23:12] <%toolofparanoia> CAUSE necromunda is another boxed game from GW but it takes place on a planet
[0:23:14] <ScreamLord> I wonder if Kitten will be in this?
[0:23:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Faith builds in Cinders are great with the free FP regen.
[0:23:20] <yourliteraldog> Necromunda was spinoff game of 40k
[0:23:23] <+deviljhojho_> instead of playing as a space marine or a zerg you are a shitty junkie which is its own brand of cool
[0:23:28] <%optimasmaximas> fuck focus home interactive

[0:25:04] <+skylerpilot> @DXLelouch24 its really not, unless its improved significantly from the beta I was in for it. Its a pretty well realized open world and looks nice but it uses a Micro Transaction Gacha system to get new characters and upgrades along with the combat being kind of clunky and shallow.

[0:41:53] <%Jekado> but what if green energy was purple?
[0:41:54] <Coystick> An RTS with PUNCH LASERS
[0:41:59] <+devilmanjay> coomer necrons
[0:42:00] <%thebonebard> my main issue with necrons is their design tends to get a bit samey, a lot of it is just skeleton man with thing or skeleton on thing
[0:42:09] <%Jeemukun> DO YOU HEAR THE VOICES TOO?!
[0:42:09] <@mothmandraws> think winter assault was my fave
[0:42:12] <$RealThiele> just throw more imp. guards at it
[0:42:14] <@mothmandraws> I liked its aesthetic
[0:42:15] <%Garthunox> No I'm gonna make it
[0:42:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> @PatStaresAt they retconned Necrons so their footsoldiers are mindless terminators but their leaders are goofy Papyrus motherfuckers
[0:42:23] <%radda343> oh god the crafter grind is killing me

[0:42:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Papyrus makes everything better
[0:42:47] <Coystick> No one tell Baige
[0:42:48] <mrbobuncle> Old Necrons were just metal tyranids and people cried like babies when they changed it.
[0:42:49] <zamzoph> This happened like a decade ago
[0:42:50] <Calek> what is Necromunda is it a 40k thing
[0:42:51] <+Regigangster> Retconned? They were always like that
[0:42:51] <%Aztec50> that face!

[0:43:00] <%thebonebard> pretty sure that necrons were originally mindless aside from a few or am i wrong
[0:43:03] <+VietcongSamurai> Trazyn the infinite OMEGALUL
[0:43:05] <%OutofPots> Did you get a new cam pat or is it just me?
[0:43:07] <%Jeemukun> yeah, it varies, so basically the higher ups of the necrons can have actual personalites
[0:43:09] <%Pappajimbo> they are more like fantasy tomb kinks
[0:43:09] <%toolofparanoia> i Like the new necrons. Better some of them have personalities because we already have mostly silent faction (besides screaming) that kills everything... they're called TRYANIDS
[0:43:10] <%shruke> shruke subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:43:14] <@mothmandraws> basically the necron leaders have had their fully rounded personalities from life degraded to be only strongest trait left
[0:43:15] <%Pappajimbo> kings
[0:43:21] <Decarcassor> New Necrons are cool. I like the idea of the Lords being different blends of crazy. :p

[0:48:05] <%ChestMimik> Oh so it's like a Factorio map
[0:48:08] <+Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt It's worth noting that the story mode is basically one big stripped down tutorial. The real game is accesed through the create gang option in the main menu
[0:48:09] <Hyphixsys> @the38bandit yes

[0:48:36] <%ChestMimik> Rats don't exist in the 40K stuff apparently
[0:48:42] <JayEarly> you could have like, a whole setting that’s just a hive city without involving the larger universe at all

[0:49:22] <+OwlLightningMage> I love that Warhammer experiments with weird shit.
[0:49:24] <%deathofghosts> if "every watt of power is closely guarded" why wasnt there a lightning rod to catch that lightning bolt?

[0:50:54] <+MacBeyer> The language isn't English, its Gothic. Therefore it must be british? IDK
[0:50:54] <+LordAngry> Britain conquered earth
[0:50:54] <+Capt_Neckbeard> They have other people with other accents. But yes, its mostly British.
[0:50:56] <+Slimshazbot> In the worst timeline, only the british survive
[0:50:58] <%kujofire990> those are the tau

[0:51:05] <%burningface> Everyone is bad in 40k. Bad people have British accents.
[0:51:05] <huskarl_zap> Without the Palantine guards theres no real power

[0:56:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Chatterbox1991 i shouldn't answer because i dont know this game, but in classic necromunda one faction is rich kids going down to fight poors for fun and they have very, very few dudes per fight but they do have power armor and fancy tech and shit

[0:59:26] <%DorianCreed> With gangs instead of spess mehrens
[0:59:26] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes
[0:59:27] <devanmuse> I mean, all Warhammer started as a tabletop game, so...
[0:59:29] <thetruenicster> Man, what is Warhammer even about?
[0:59:30] <mellorolo> YAAAA!!
[0:59:30] <eldercat> Basically
[0:59:31] <%honeyman18> They have little round stands on the map
[0:59:33] <$lotharrio> It's like a giant hive planet. You'd hate this planet the most.
[0:59:33] <Decarcassor> So if they made Mordheim and now Necromunda do you think we have any chance of ever seeing a Gorkamorka video game ? Kappa
[0:59:37] <%SWFanatic> Select your fighter
[0:59:37] <+alpharius88> was isnt a board game in warhammer.....
[0:59:37] <%Taisuru> It's 40k but with small squads instead of armies
[0:59:40] <huskarl_zap> THROW all your terrain on the table then play
[0:59:43] <%Pappajimbo> yes think mini 40k games
[0:59:44] <%ianabstract> The characters in that view even have a round base like the models do
[0:59:46] <%ChestMimik> @thetruenicster Space
[0:59:49] <Solokaldaka> burkeAhoy chat
[0:59:50] <%Deano8817> @thetruenicster war
[0:59:50] <huskarl_zap> 2017 necro has a board
[0:59:50] <@commanderclaw> Kind of, it's a mini 40k skirmish game
[0:59:53] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:59:53] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt It stars gangs on a shitty hive world.
[0:59:54] <Man_in_the_Red> @thetruenicster space imperialism
[0:59:54] <Parapattern> It's 40K for the working joes of this universe
[1:00:05] <%burningface> Warhammer is a black comedy about Space Fascists and Racism
[1:00:06] <%toolofparanoia> FUCK HER UP
[1:00:10] <%SWFanatic> Is this Chimera Squad without the Chimera Squad?
[1:00:14] <Hyphixsys> Gitstomppah
[1:00:14] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt It's very comparable to Warhammer Fantasy's skirmish game Mordheim, which also has a PC version
[1:00:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> WATS ALL DIS DEN!?
[1:00:20] <Senselessvirus> @thetruenicster glad you asked, here let me pull out my 9 hour powerpoint
[1:00:21] <%SWFanatic> Aw fuck

[1:00:32] <%Ne1son> lel flashlight so funnee
[1:00:34] <%MonsterEnvy> Warhammer Fantasy version
[1:00:34] <$lotharrio> @thetruenicster It started as a way to get rid of already miniatures made for DnD. Then it became a satire for like 20 years. Now it's all people taking it too seriously. Also, British.
[1:00:36] <mechengineers> oh shit they have the high ground
[1:00:36] <@mothmandraws> so small lore thing, all gangs in necromunda are allied to the big houses
[1:00:39] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Same devs
[1:00:39] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yeap
[1:00:41] <@mothmandraws> the houses are like country sized gangs
[1:00:45] <Sotetsu> Bloody hell, where's me tea and crumpets?
[1:00:46] <$Memdosu> makes you kneel
[1:00:48] <+NoirePanzer> Oi m8 u speain bri'ish?
[1:00:49] <%Hasmeister96> Is this game meant to be like XCOM? Comparisons to Valkyria Chronicles don't really help me, cos I don't really know what that is
[1:00:50] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Necromunda is Mordheim 40k
[1:00:53] <%toolofparanoia> its getting into cover
[1:01:01] <Parapattern> "What if facebook likes were the only way to earn a quid?"
[1:01:05] <%SWFanatic> You havin a laff?
[1:01:05] <%toolofparanoia> COVER IS CRUCIAL
[1:01:13] <+MacBeyer> this game has less "oops I rolled bad and couldn't go up this tiny ledge and also take damage" than Mordheim thankfully.
[1:01:19] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[1:01:19] <%MonsterEnvy> I don't think Knelling would have cost you an action
[1:01:21] <chaumiester> Hive City? Wait, isn't this the city that got shelled/artilleried for 20 years by the Death Korps of Krieg?
[1:01:21] <$lotharrio> @Hasmeister96 My understanding is XCom and Valkyria Chronicles are basically cousins of each other.
[1:01:21] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Miss
[1:01:26] <%Visorak6> slows movement probably
[1:01:27] <nademonkey1100> FUCK COVER
[1:01:27] <+Regigangster> D: WHAT DID TRIXIE DO
[1:01:28] <%toolofparanoia> pew pew
[1:01:30] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Xcom Miss
[1:01:31] <Decarcassor> There is also Gorkamorka, which is basicly Mad Max with Orks. :p
[1:01:34] <+Soliloquy123> Less MP
[1:01:35] <%SWFanatic> Trixie you is a pisspot you stingy slobber mung
[1:01:36] <yourliteraldog> Houses are governing noblity, they run gangs to do dirty work illegal work
[1:01:37] <huskarl_zap> Debuff movement
[1:01:39] <%Deano8817> @Hasmeister96 xcom but you basically aim in 3rd person to shoot each turn
[1:01:39] <@mothmandraws> its random chance to be pinned on hit, lowers their mp
[1:01:49] <$lotharrio> @chaumiester There's a lot of Hive planets/cities. So who knows.
[1:01:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @mothmandraws i feel like Warhammer hives are more realistic than say, Coruscant. You wouldnt have THE WHOLE PLANET be a city its like, several country-sized cities and then miles of blighted wasteland between them. Terra is almost 100% tho i guess
[1:01:53] <Don_Discovery> @chaumiester most city planets are called hive cities because of how they are built
[1:02:01] <%Hasmeister96> @lotharrio OK thanks
[1:02:07] <zamzoph> @Hasmeister96 it's mainly to do with how you move your characters, running them around like an action game within a certain radius
[1:02:08] <+CelioHogane> Oh that woman has sick hair
[1:02:12] <@mothmandraws> necromunda planet is like 8 cities, necromunda hive primus being main one
[1:02:13] <%SWFanatic> chop chop
[1:02:15] <@mothmandraws> rest is ash waste
[1:02:17] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:02:17] <JayEarly> The fucked up thing about lasguns is that they’re nicknamed “flashlights” but they’re actually frighteningly powerful weapon in other context but 40k
[1:02:18] <%DukeMoose> shes slower though
[1:02:21] <+Regigangster> It's an open pin
[1:02:28] <%BinaryFireball> so it is literally the board game in a videogame form
[1:02:29] <%burningface> Once upon a time in the lore, Necromunda was the most populated planet in the Imperium with about 100 billion people on it
[1:02:30] <chaumiester> @lotharrio @Don_Discovery Fair enough. Did not know that
[1:02:30] <steelstwitchaccount> Just walks right up to her all polite like
[1:02:34] <%Hasmeister96> @Deano8817 OK thanks
[1:02:42] <huskarl_zap> target too close
[1:02:43] <AFlyingTaco1> So why do they all have the same color scheme?
[1:02:47] <+Regigangster> LUL they shouldve probably streamlined this better
[1:02:50] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> @JayEarly Lasrifles are nicknamed flashlights, not lasguns.
[1:02:56] <@mothmandraws> because this is same gang infighting
[1:02:57] <Man_in_the_Red> gangs
[1:03:04] <Hyphixsys> sound plan LUL
[1:03:06] <SomeOtherNeb> hello Patrick, hello Chatrick
[1:03:07] <%DukeMoose> Pinned = movement point debuff
[1:03:08] <%Hasmeister96> @zamzoph OK thanks
[1:03:15] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> @JayEarly and that nickname is generally regarded as being quite a poor represenation of lasrifles.
[1:03:19] <JustYudha> Yes English
[1:03:20] <Parapattern> Shouldn't they be called "Torches" instead of "flashlights"?
[1:03:20] <%ChestMimik> Murder em and steal their stuff, got it
[1:03:21] <%Taisuru> Get loot from backpack of loot
[1:03:21] <@mothmandraws> steal their shit
[1:03:22] <%SWFanatic> Patrickah!
[1:03:25] <dinnydanny777> Was that English?
[1:03:25] <ShineTheDiamond> !necro
[1:03:25] <@Moobot> Hey check out Necromunda Underhive Wars it's like Valkyria Chronicles and Warhammer had a weird techno baby https://bit.ly/32RyoDD
[1:03:25] <el_anglicano> Lasguns are less common than Autoguns in a civvie context because they're more difficult to produce
[1:03:27] <%toolofparanoia> this soundtrack kicks ass
[1:03:34] <%SWFanatic> !philia
[1:03:35] <+CelioHogane> Wait, does this game literally use the Warhammer 40k ruleset?
[1:03:36] <+MacBeyer> loot their shitty gear from their shitty bag
[1:03:37] <dinnydanny777> Was that some kind of Canadian dialect I'm unfamiliar with?
[1:03:39] <el_anglicano> But once you get one it lasts a long time
[1:03:41] <steelstwitchaccount> So this is Fallout D&D?
[1:03:41] <@Moobot> Hey check out Necromunda Underhive Wars it's like Valkyria Chronicles and Warhammer had a weird techno baby https://bit.ly/32RyoDD
[1:03:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> Lasguns require a higher tech base to produce but they churn out lots
[1:03:59] <Don_Discovery> shut the fuck up moobot
[1:04:01] <%thebonebard> i read on one of the steam reviews this isnt very like the actual tabletop
[1:04:02] <+Capt_Neckbeard> !necro
[1:04:02] <%SWFanatic> Morenn KNEEL
[1:04:09] <%thebonebard> but i never played the actual game
[1:04:13] <el_anglicano> The gangs have far more money of course
[1:04:18] <Them00n> The AI in this is kind of a mess.
[1:04:18] <Man_in_the_Red> @steelstwitchaccount more Road Warrior in space
[1:04:20] <@mothmandraws> I play tabletop, its close enough honestly
[1:04:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> also lasguns are insanely easy to use. Like you can take a caveman and after maybe a week of drills and practie you can get them adequately trained with a lasgun
[1:04:24] <Them00n> Can't path good
[1:04:25] <Parapattern> That bird's got an axe, she does
[1:04:26] <ShineTheDiamond> The reviews said there were a lot of AI issues

[1:04:48] <BaslerJones> MURDER IS BETTER
[1:04:49] <@mothmandraws> the ai seems to have issues on being decisive, it will move alot to find good spot
[1:04:51] <%SWFanatic> RAIDEN
[1:04:51] <%bevyrage> @thebonebard it's so far looking like xcom2's approach to tabletop but using 40k format
[1:04:55] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> LUL
[1:04:55] <huskarl_zap> Tapletop is high miss low wound this is high health high accuracy
[1:04:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> also if you dont have access to a battery recharge station you can leave the lasgun battery pack by a campfire overnight to recharge it. OR in an emergency you can just light it on fire but that will fuck its max capacity
[1:05:17] <%Typhaeon> Let's get it on now, select & pick the best one
[1:05:19] <@mothmandraws> huskarl tell that to my van saar playing friend

[1:05:32] <%toolofparanoia> DO OVERWATCH
[1:05:40] <+Capt_Neckbeard> CAWDOR
[1:05:44] <@mothmandraws> big guns tend to jam more and get less chance with skill
[1:05:45] <Decarcassor> Lasguns are great, Xenos are just cheating with their filthy heretic tech.
[1:05:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @bevyrage Now im picturing a Tactically Naked orc who is just wearing a high tech laser bracelet

[1:05:54] <ShineTheDiamond> I am 100% still getting the game eventually, I just hope they fix some issues soon :)
[1:05:57] <+linSP> download the app
[1:05:58] <%ha2ken> No Overwatch App
[1:06:00] <+Capt_Neckbeard> BY THE EMPERORS GRACE, CAWDOR SHALL BRING VICTORY TO THERE HOUSE
[1:06:03] <+OwlLightningMage> You gotta download the Overwatch app
[1:06:03] <%SvenHolgersson> ONLY OVERLOOK
[1:06:04] <%AzureGale> You need the Blizzard launcher to do Overwatch
[1:06:04] <TrollKing96> I'd imagine lasguns are reserved for the Imperial Guard and other branches while almost everyone else gets autoguns.
[1:06:05] <+Soliloquy123> They're blocked until the tutorial tells you about them anyway
[1:06:05] <%logoth_> Laser the ass
[1:06:06] <JayEarly> @liquiddinosaur yeah being easy to use is important when you’re recruiting from planets that have a medieval level of tech if that
[1:06:09] <%Rumbutt> Overwatch has an ap now? oroLUL

[1:09:50] <chaumiester> Sooooo, do you have to be British to be in the gang in the Future?
[1:09:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> @chaumiester lol there's none of the "main factions" in this game. this is entirely just gangsters living in the ultra-ghettos of the sprawling hive megacities. Probably none of these characters have ever seen the sky.
[1:09:53] <steelstwitchaccount> Jeff?
[1:09:56] <%SWFanatic> My hat

[1:10:06] <$lotharrio> @CelioHogane Well see their religion doesn't really allow for "real" robots. So they just take people and turn them into robots.
[1:10:15] <+MacBeyer> she's your escort objective.
[1:10:17] <+Bentusi1634> They're members of a noble house of this planet. The noble houses fight in the slums for fun and pleasure. The noble house Escher has a genetic defect that kills most male children.
[1:10:17] <@mothmandraws> oh pats getting the audio desynch I got
[1:10:18] <dinnydanny777> She looked like she wanted somebody to paint her like one of the French girls

[1:10:21] <huskarl_zap> Pat would get turned into a toilet servitor
[1:10:24] <ShineTheDiamond> The outfit designs are awesome. I want those face masks!
[1:10:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> @chaumiester you need to be british t BE in the future. If you arent british you're dead. which is probably a mercy in the future

[1:11:13] <+deviljhojho_> its the orlocks
[1:11:13] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt the'yre basically impossible to tell apart, it's all scorpion's harem girls
[1:11:14] <dinnydanny777> Is this the series where the designers called it a satire of Thatcher's Britain?
[1:11:14] <+alpharius88> maybe a toster
[1:11:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige knows what that is. She doesn't want to ruin the drama
[1:11:15] <+Slimshazbot> Those aren't bolters
[1:11:17] <zamzoph> they're not bolters
[1:11:17] <nademonkey1100> what? no
[1:11:18] <BaslerJones> THEY ARE COOL
[1:11:18] <+asasqw> Na man, autoguns
[1:11:19] <@commanderclaw> Those aren't bolters
[1:11:20] <%Visorak6> I think those are autoguns/stubbers, bolters would be WAY louder
[1:11:21] <huskarl_zap> Those arent bolters
[1:11:22] <%burningface> I mean they're not Bolters
[1:11:22] <Dirksolomon> Those are not bolters, they are autoguns
[1:11:23] <%DukeMoose> those are autoguns
[1:11:25] <+Bentusi1634> Autoguns.
[1:11:25] <+Sendaar> FUCK THE BLUE TEAM
[1:11:25] <%chiluzza> THAT AINT A BOLTER
[1:11:25] <Kostas1001> @PatStaresAt those are not bolters pat
[1:11:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @chaumiester oh wait some of these people might be rich people from the Upper Hive nobility who are just down in the slums to fight poor people for fun/to find the ancient lost Macguffin.
[1:11:25] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Warhammer 40k The Warriors
[1:11:26] <+IntrepidEye> Pretty sure those are autoguns
[1:11:27] <+Capt_Neckbeard> None of those men have Bolters, those are just autoguns.
[1:11:27] <Zombrocom> Not boltors
[1:11:28] <+HefestoForges> sluggers
[1:11:29] <%Taisuru> autoguns
[1:11:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Goddamn Blues
[1:11:30] <huskarl_zap> Those are just automatic rifles
[1:11:31] <Decarcassor> Orlocks are the gun boys
[1:11:31] <Them00n> Those just shoot normal bullets
[1:11:32] <+tigerfang86> YEAH GO BLUE TEAM
[1:11:32] <+Slimshazbot> Bolters would be exploding people
[1:11:33] <ShineTheDiamond> Question: is there a hairspray industry in this universe? Because that is some BIG hair...
[1:11:34] <%DukeMoose> there ARE bolters
[1:11:34] <Baruberu> Yeah not Bolters
[1:11:35] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:11:35] <+pectusumbra> I mean if they were bolters those ladies would be gibs right?
[1:11:35] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> blotgun
[1:11:35] <%thegreenbenis> Just fucking guns. @PatStaresAt
[1:11:35] <+deviljhojho_> bolters are actually quality guns unlike these peashotters
[1:11:38] <el_anglicano> No, bolters are literal small missiles pat
[1:11:39] <%optimasmaximas> psaCrazy
[1:11:39] <huskarl_zap> You'll see a bolter soon
[1:11:40] <+jack_hstreams> Bolters are usually mounted on vehicles
[1:11:40] <%cylish> Cant fire a bolter without power armor
[1:11:41] <%thebonebard> wait are auto guns different from stubbers
[1:11:41] <%ianabstract> Bolters are full auto grenade launchers
[1:11:42] <$lotharrio> Bolters are rocket propelled explosive rounds. Basically machine grenade guns.
[1:11:42] <Senselessvirus> @PatStaresAt Autogun actually bolters are too fancy
[1:11:42] <mrblack499> lol
[1:11:43] <Zombrocom> Bolters are automatic RPG
[1:11:44] <%toolofparanoia> they are heavy autoguns
[1:11:44] <+Tucker0603> no, autoguns
[1:11:45] <+RenoDeGeneric> Bolters are like 95 caliber monsters
[1:11:45] <BaslerJones> these cutscenes aren't that good
[1:11:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @chaumiester basically imagine Mega City One but even more fucked up.
[1:11:46] <+Capt_Neckbeard> Bolters are almost impo9ssible for anyone but a spacemarine.... most of the time.
[1:11:48] <+Ragnakawaii> Bolters would explode their bodies from the recoil
[1:11:48] <+IntrepidEye> autoguns basically assault rifles
[1:11:48] <steelstwitchaccount> Poor Subzero
[1:11:48] <dundore77> 40k still has conventional weaponry.
[1:11:49] <+jack_hstreams> Marines just wield them because they're big and strong
[1:11:49] <%cylish> or a genetic super man
[1:11:50] <qbrx> Bolters would leave some massive holes
[1:11:50] <%marsantas> If they were bolters they would be in more pieces
[1:11:51] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Kill the Red! Kill the Red!
[1:11:51] <freyes5291> this game is old as fuck, how do you not know about it?
[1:11:51] <%chiluzza> thats a stubber she was shooting
[1:11:52] <%TIME_PUNCHER> normal humans can't handles the recoil of bolters @patstaresat
[1:11:55] <%arcielardor> What are the women called again? The Dick Stabbers?
[1:11:57] <Daoshinto> to me; this dialogue feels like a poorly acted play, instead of persons communicating and it is upsetting enough to comment on.
[1:11:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> @chaumiester or like, Taris
[1:11:59] <+MacBeyer> pretty sure there's at least one guy here with a "bolter"
[1:11:59] <+alpharius88> no those arent bolters only sisters, sapace marine and some inquisitors or comisars use bolters
[1:12:02] <%SWFanatic> these cutscenes remind me of Brink
[1:12:06] <+TDotGoat> GIVE EM HECK
[1:12:09] <huskarl_zap> Eschers
[1:12:10] <%thebonebard> there are humans that use bolters but i think they are smaller bolters
[1:12:11] <chaumiester> Bolters are handheld Auto-Cannons
[1:12:14] <JayEarly> are there stubbers in this?
[1:12:14] <%ha2ken> OverWAP
[1:12:17] <%walternatorz> what was that ungodly noise?
[1:12:19] <freyes5291> CTRL
[1:12:20] <$lotharrio> I feel like Ogryns use bolters?
[1:12:20] <+pectusumbra> yes
[1:12:22] <freyes5291> EYE BALL
[1:12:23] <chaumiester> @LiquidDinosaur I see
[1:12:23] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt Bolters are machine guns with grenade bullets
[1:12:24] <el_anglicano> They're autoguns. Lesser upfront cost than lasguns but more expensive over time
[1:12:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Overwatch can only make porn once per round
[1:12:24] <+unbentchimp> arn't boltors also massive to the point where anyone who isn't an Astartes can use one
[1:12:25] <%DukeMoose> the triandle
[1:12:26] <heartlesshealer> Hmmm
[1:12:28] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[1:12:31] <%SWFanatic> Wet Ass Poverwatch
[1:12:31] <Parapattern> Probably the eye thing
[1:12:32] <Saltmeisterr> eyebol
[1:12:34] <freyes5291> YES PAT!
[1:12:34] <+pectusumbra> I'd assume blue is overwatch, or the eyeball
[1:12:34] <%thegreenbenis> EYEBALL
[1:12:34] <+Captain_Spicy_> Eyeball
[1:12:34] <steelstwitchaccount> It's gotta be the eyball symbol
[1:12:34] <huskarl_zap> I think yes
[1:12:35] <BoneofMalkav> Are you an OverWAHP?
[1:12:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> @SWFanatic now it might be mitigated because its a Multiplayer game with an excuse plot but imagine if brink came out now
[1:12:36] <%DedlokPM> Pretty sure I heard that if you are not a space marine and/or in power armor firing a bolter would rip off your arm
[1:12:37] <%ChestMimik> Green on the right
[1:12:37] <+Tucker0603> yes
[1:12:39] <%Taisuru> Yes
[1:12:39] <%toolofparanoia> acktually .... Bolters are .75 caliber rounds, Heavy Bolters are .995 cal
[1:12:39] <T_Sasquatch> Ass
[1:12:43] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> the eye with the line
[1:12:43] <huskarl_zap> If you shot youll know
[1:12:44] <ShineTheDiamond> @freyes5291 people weren't born in that decade and/or never got into the board game community until they got older.
[1:12:44] <Hyphixsys> OWLteamkill
[1:12:46] <heartlesshealer> Hard to zoom, but might be eyeball in triangle
[1:12:52] <AFlyingTaco1> Underass
[1:12:52] <$lotharrio> @unbentchimp Basically you'd want to be wearing power armor to use a bolter.
[1:12:57] <dinnydanny777> Someone turn this into a song pls
[1:12:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @SWFanatic its literally "in a post global warming apocalypse world, people who want to have a place to live vs. cops working for rich people
[1:13:03] <Chatterbox1991> overwaatch
[1:13:04] <+pectusumbra> so stand still and shoot?
[1:13:05] <heartlesshealer> Over-WAP
[1:13:05] <huskarl_zap> Shot first and it stops over watch
[1:13:05] <+TDotGoat> it's all watch?
[1:13:05] <steelstwitchaccount> Everyones looking to get those Attacks of Opportunity.
[1:13:10] <%SWFanatic> @LiquidDinosaur why give MP a plot
[1:13:12] <+scerpico> Lots of people use Bolters, Astartes just use extra big and powerful versions
[1:13:13] <Abecale> How come they all wimmin
[1:13:13] <ShineTheDiamond> Ooooooo
[1:13:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> was their no purple for pat?
[1:13:16] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm gonna scream if he keeps saying Overwaatch
[1:13:21] <BoneofMalkav> Everyone's on OverWAP and only 1 guy on Team WAPtress 2
[1:13:21] <bazusoos> !necro

[1:13:22] <%cylish> oh its models, thats cool
[1:13:25] <%Guardiansaiyan> HIGH GROUND
[1:13:25] <dundore77> if this is anything like Mordheim the game is stupidly hard for new players/starting out on a new campaign
[1:13:26] <el_anglicano> A bolter is more or less a deluxe rocket launcher from a civvie perspective
[1:13:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @SWFanatic i mean not even "a plot" but like, " a setting"
[1:13:28] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this DOOM map
[1:13:28] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Oops! All overwatch!
[1:13:30] <%toolofparanoia> Catachans can use bolters, if they brace their shots
[1:13:33] <%ha2ken> You'll win if you have the high ground
[1:13:34] <+Captain_Spicy_> OWLcheers OWLcheers OWLcheers OWLcheers
[1:13:36] <%SWFanatic> yeah
[1:13:39] <+Ketronox> Lil Pat's "overwatch"
[1:13:43] <+Bentusi1634> House Escher has a genetic defect that kills most male children @Abecale
[1:13:47] <%DedlokPM> @heartlesshealer that is a sign of a huge health problem. mogsSmeel

[1:13:53] <dinnydanny777> here*
[1:13:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @chaumiester like one of the factions is House Cawdor who's thing is they're SUPER RELIGIOUS. LIke so religious the space government is like "ok these guys could be a liability"
[1:13:55] <ShineTheDiamond> Is there a map editor? I would LOVE to make maps for this game
[1:14:00] <Hyphixsys> OWLfireatwill
[1:14:02] <Abecale> Oh okay

[1:15:12] <%ha2ken> So is this battle just boys versus girls?
[1:15:17] <Hyphixsys> shoot a grenade SeemsGood
[1:15:20] <freyes5291> not nearly as user friendly
[1:15:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh fun lore fact: the reason the Sisters of Battle Exist is because a few thousand years ago, the Space Pope tried to do a military coup, and when he was beaten they passed a law saying the Church cant directly field "Men under arms." Soooo the Church unveiled its new all-female private military force!
[1:15:23] <dinnydanny777> I appreciate how horrible this place looks to live in

[1:16:33] <%arcielardor> there's a sweet spot for the flame thrower and I think whatever counts as the shotgun
[1:16:36] <zamzoph> probably just random damage
[1:16:37] <el_anglicano> Fun fact: there's so much organic sludge that splurging out of Necromunda some patches of land were refertilized due to the excess of nutrients
[1:16:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> @toolofparanoia which army
[1:16:51] <steelstwitchaccount> Tig had to think about it.
[1:16:52] <Parapattern> The girls in this game are VERY hot
[1:16:54] <Hyphixsys> Soldier 76 OWLMercy
[1:17:00] <+Bentusi1634> House Orlock controls iron production on the planet and its gangs are known for being tight knit and made up mostly of former workers.
[1:17:05] <freyes5291> @IminyourBase it's not for the weak hearted
[1:17:05] <%toolofparanoia> Orlock Gang. The House of Iron expansion
[1:17:21] <steelstwitchaccount> I mean, looks like you can run for days, positioning seems pretty chill.
[1:17:21] <%SWFanatic> @Parapattern I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more overwhatch
[1:17:26] <+OwlLightningMage> WATCH LIKE A WRIST WATCH
[1:17:27] <%AncelDeLambert> this is so WEIRD
[1:17:33] <+Bentusi1634> Lit. called "The House of Iron"
[1:17:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> @el_anglicano i remember in Dark Heresy you could take Survival as a skill but you had to specify what environment. SO it could be like, forest, jungle, desert, or Urban which basically means that you can survive roughing it in the Underhives. and, you know which pipes to sleep next to for warmth or which kinds of industrial runoff are semi-edible
[1:17:55] <%Taisuru> @AncelDeLambert You know there's a bunch of game like this right?
[1:17:55] <%AncelDeLambert> I love aim-shooting, it's so much better than blind-punching
[1:17:55] <@Moobot> Hey check out Necromunda Underhive Wars it's like Valkyria Chronicles and Warhammer had a weird techno baby https://bit.ly/32RyoDD
[1:17:56] <Hyphixsys> VATS
[1:17:58] <+pectusumbra> V.A.T.S.
[1:18:01] <freyes5291> SWEEP THE LEG JOHNNY!
[1:18:02] <Moonlight_Grimoire> vaaats

[1:18:18] <%toolofparanoia> Iron Within, Iron Without. IV Legion represent
[1:18:19] <%SWFanatic> Berserker Barrage
[1:18:21] <BoneofMalkav> Kick his leg out of his leg
[1:18:26] <%Dash_rendar89> Dash_rendar89 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! MOAR DAKKA
[1:18:29] <AFlyingTaco1> Are strategy RPGs finally making a comeback with this and Iron Harvest?
[1:18:32] <%SWFanatic> Sweeg the leg
[1:18:35] <T_Sasquatch> My legs are ok!
[1:18:35] <%SWFanatic> also sweep
[1:18:42] <huskarl_zap> GANG TACKLE
[1:18:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> @toolofparanoia Perterabo got a raw deal.
[1:18:43] <+hoenhime344> it takes 3 to tango
[1:18:50] <+Captain_Spicy_> This looks pretty cool, and Necromunda is a neat area. I just hope later on the sheer number of stats to keep track of becomes overwhelming to the point of min-max hell
[1:18:50] <freyes5291> hose that leg outta that house
[1:18:56] <Hyphixsys> @AFlyingTaco1 it has been around for a while. It's just didn't get enough traction
[1:18:56] <huskarl_zap> GOLIATH GANG TACKLE
[1:18:58] <+Capt_Neckbeard> Its just a shotgun.
[1:19:03] <huskarl_zap> I hate the cryogun
[1:19:11] <%Ranryu692> amazing that this dude is just letting you do all that
[1:19:16] <freyes5291> GOLIATH FO LIFE!
[1:19:17] <%AncelDeLambert> that's the way, Pat, nice and grouped up to get blatted with a grenade later
[1:19:18] <+hoenhime344> pats gotta "take him down"
[1:19:24] <Hyphixsys> Tig is a champ LUL
[1:19:25] <nademonkey1100> its flamer
[1:19:33] <huskarl_zap> Its random dmg pat
[1:19:36] <+Tucker0603> it's a cryo gun
[1:19:37] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it does the same damage all the time
[1:19:40] <viciousgrim> trying to watch Blazing Saddles. . . so hard
[1:19:42] <Hyphixsys> RIP
[1:19:45] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it just does it in that range right
[1:19:45] <zamzoph> CHILL OUT
[1:19:49] <+Capt_Neckbeard> Well then
[1:19:50] <@mothmandraws> loot him
[1:19:52] <steelstwitchaccount> Damage is rolled.
[1:19:55] <%SWFanatic> STICK AROUND
[1:19:56] <+asasqw> @PatStaresAt A graze is a % chance, its all the sweet spot
[1:19:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @toolofparanoia he literally just wanted to help build a nice utopian space society but then Space Dad came down and was like "ok son here is an army of killing machines i made in your image go fuck shit up. " "Uh could i build some stuff at least?" "No i already have a son who builds stuff your job is to tear sit down and die in zerg rushes so your cooler brothers can clean up afterwards and take the glory"
[1:20:02] <%DensityD> wake me up before you go go
[1:20:08] <huskarl_zap> I actually dont know if this game has shotguns
[1:20:08] <%DappercatEsquire> pargon pargon backpack
[1:20:08] <Profmcstevie> Pat down his booty for...booty barbToxic
[1:20:10] <%toolofparanoia> @LiquidDinosaur He seems like a big baby bitch/petulant child. I don't even know the reason he joined horus. Not that far in the heresy books
[1:20:14] <AFlyingTaco1> You know what, if a bunch of hot girls missing like half their clothes ganged up on me, I'd be okay with that
[1:20:14] <huskarl_zap> it should cause they exist
[1:20:17] <+OwlLightningMage> ASH IS ALREADY BLACK WHY SPECIFY IT
[1:20:30] <Hyphixsys> OOOF
[1:20:32] <%AncelDeLambert> YEAH! Shoot that floor!
[1:20:33] <%DensityD> LUL
[1:20:35] <%SWFanatic> peck
[1:20:35] <freyes5291> GET REKT
[1:20:38] <+Totally_Not_Toby> nah sometimes it's gray
[1:20:38] <steelstwitchaccount> Oh shit, we lose a girl?
[1:20:39] <+Soliloquy123> @PatStaresAt If you don't move much in a turn, you can use Entrench to trade MP for AP to shoot again, very important
[1:20:42] <ComicReliefHero> Fuck it sure would be nice to play through a round of this game without crashing to desktop
[1:20:42] <%DedlokPM> @OwlLightningMage ash can be white or gray.
[1:20:48] <nademonkey1100> looks like cover would have been nice
[1:20:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @toolofparanoia i mean, literally all of the primarchs are 9 foot tall manchildren. the reason the empire collapsed is because the only person more emotionally more stunted than them was their dad
[1:20:49] <+MacBeyer> ash is grey though?
[1:20:50] <el_anglicano> I hope we get to see one of the Upper Class Districts where they cram all the cool cathedrals, functioning hospitals and good restaurants
[1:20:54] <%toolofparanoia> @LiquidDinosaur Man, the Emperor is like the Worst Father ever
[1:20:55] <huskarl_zap> @OwlLightningMage You act as if Gangers are smart also ash can be grey or whiteish
[1:21:03] <+Bentusi1634> That is a heavy stubber, a form of man portable autocannon.
[1:21:07] <steelstwitchaccount> Check it out, the blues got a girl too!
[1:21:10] <Hyphixsys> RUKIAH, a Bleach character LUL
[1:21:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Not if if you burn it super hard
[1:21:21] <huskarl_zap> Woolie should see the Customizer
[1:21:23] <freyes5291> @ComicReliefHero i have zero crashes thus far
[1:21:24] <@mothmandraws> I still think core system of this game is good just needs some tweaks like faster enemy turns
[1:21:25] <+HefestoForges> wtf
[1:21:27] <+Bentusi1634> House Orlock is pretty gender neutral for its gangs.
[1:21:29] <+Capt_Neckbeard> Emperor is second worst dad ever. Worst dad ever is Horus
[1:21:36] <@mothmandraws> booby trap
[1:21:36] <+Capt_Neckbeard> No, Erebus
[1:21:38] <BlindGato> Rage agaisnt
[1:21:39] <+HefestoForges> she just shadowstepped
[1:21:42] <freyes5291> NEVER
[1:21:46] <ComicReliefHero> @freyes5291 Must be nice. 3 in 10 hours.
[1:21:47] <freyes5291> Horus is God
[1:21:47] <%AncelDeLambert> damn talking BOX!
[1:21:47] <%walternatorz> you're good at producing music
[1:21:53] <%SWFanatic> wee
[1:21:56] <%toolofparanoia> Erebus is the creepy uncle
[1:22:10] <+Order_of_Mystery> "hot diggity" lol
[1:22:10] <el_anglicano> Wait, are they all ladies? Does that mean this is technically a waifu game?
[1:22:11] <@mothmandraws> you get alot of mp
[1:22:15] <+OwlLightningMage> WRIST WATCH
[1:22:16] <ComicReliefHero> and that's not even talking soft locks on enemy AI SeemsGood
[1:22:27] <huskarl_zap> not that one pat
[1:22:27] <BoneofMalkav> "I hate machines!" she screams as her weapons are made from machine technology LUL
[1:22:28] <Hyphixsys> cut the zipline, so both can't cross LUL
[1:22:29] <@mothmandraws> dont do taht cut a different one
[1:22:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> @toolofparanoia have you read The Last Church? It's about the Emperor talking to the last christian priest when he's just about done conquering earth. and the author admits that both the pro and anti-religion arguments presented are strawmen. But that isnt the point the point is The Emperor is a prick
[1:22:36] <huskarl_zap> find another to cut
[1:22:49] <mrbobuncle> use the elevator on the bottom right
[1:23:03] <freyes5291> use the "SWEEP THE LEG" ability
[1:23:05] <%thebonebard> yea emperor is a dickhead... but i mean he was also trying to stop hell
[1:23:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @toolofparanoia he's a Reddit Atheist and him being worshipped as his empire crumbles and collapses into idiot fundamentalism just makes it a more ironic hell
[1:23:09] <%DedlokPM> @walternatorz also apparently good at making people realize you are not political when you super are
[1:23:22] <%Ne1son> That sounds like heresy liquid
[1:23:23] <sendart> the emperor
[1:23:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @LiquidDinosaur he was a total asshole. TTS group had a good podcast about it
[1:23:51] <mrbobuncle> there are two elevators pat
[1:23:54] <%AncelDeLambert> BOING
[1:23:57] <+HefestoForges> what is this heresy
[1:23:57] <%toolofparanoia> @LiquidDinosaur Indeed, he is a prick. His main reason for doing it "Because I am right."... But also Chaos
[1:24:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> This emperor forsaken place has "Exterminauts" written all over it
[1:24:01] <%SWFanatic> there are four lights
[1:24:01] <Man_in_the_Red> @liquiddinosaur all acording to Lorgar's keikaku (?)
[1:24:04] <ComicReliefHero> VULKAN LIVES!
[1:24:04] <dinnydanny777> Movement is always good
[1:24:11] <sendart> the emperor made deals with chaos then broke them lol
[1:24:14] <Giztech> this character has a grapple hook
[1:24:18] <dinnydanny777> A lot of games would be improved by having more movement
[1:24:19] <@mothmandraws> if you use jumps and ziplines you can do some huge flanks
[1:24:20] <+Capt_Neckbeard> She's a level 5 ganger compared to everyone else who's level 1 Pat
[1:24:22] <+OwlLightningMage> WATCH
[1:24:28] <freyes5291> the emperor is a joke
[1:24:29] <el_anglicano> Emperor did not like telling anybody what his plans where because he feared they would fuck it up otherwise
[1:24:33] <%AncelDeLambert> overwatch: the strongest of actions
[1:24:39] <+HefestoForges> oh so that's what that is
[1:24:46] <@mothmandraws> it just shifts you if you on a wierd geometry thing
[1:24:47] <+ArtemisCroc> the high amount of movement almost makes this game pallatable to me
[1:24:52] <%SWFanatic> Liu Kang
[1:24:57] <$toolofparanoia> then the chaos god stole his kids and spread them around the galaxy like the dragonballs
[1:24:57] <@Moobot> Hey check out Necromunda Underhive Wars it's like Valkyria Chronicles and Warhammer had a weird techno baby https://bit.ly/32RyoDD
[1:25:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Over watch is an understatement
[1:25:04] <%thebonebard> i think also he didnt want chaos to know about the webway project
[1:25:07] <KaiserMario> Are ye 'avin fun here, ye?
[1:25:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Fightor sounds like an 80s cartoon villain
[1:25:18] <+HefestoForges> @mothmandraws I was startled by the AI doing that before

[1:29:29] <nvrwaker> Does this play kinda like valkyria?

[1:30:34] <Daxalog> Its based on how much of them you can see
[1:30:35] <%toolofparanoia> isnt the other faction that was pitted against the Enforcers, literally Judge Dredd cops, just a khornate chaos cult?
[1:30:43] <@mothmandraws> the real line of sight is nice, but I think its what causes ai to freak out

[1:31:55] <+MacBeyer> same as Mordheim
[1:31:55] <@mothmandraws> reload while being in ow aswell
[1:32:04] <$lotharrio> I think the hive cities on Earth are technically better, but outside of them is like... radioactive deserts.
[1:32:04] <@Moobot> Hey check out Necromunda Underhive Wars it's like Valkyria Chronicles and Warhammer had a weird techno baby https://bit.ly/32RyoDD
[1:32:06] <%Jay_Squirrel> Jay_Squirrel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! cant think of anything clever to say, thank for entertainment orb man
[1:32:07] <stabbityrabbit> I believe the whole of Terra is hive city now @TrollKing96
[1:32:07] <Man_in_the_Red> @trollking96 Terra is nearly entirely city
[1:32:07] <%Piemen99> jesus her leg just now

[1:33:06] <+Bentusi1634> The Corpse Grinder Cults are made up for former Corpse Guild workers who snap after years of cutting up dead Hive citizens to produce "Corpse Starch".

[1:33:23] <rhovybear> Van Saar is where it's at. Xeno tech is hype train
[1:33:25] <steelstwitchaccount> Maybe the missing 24% is her just being a scrub?
[1:33:27] <%TIME_PUNCHER> are ya poggers, son?
[1:33:27] <$lotharrio> I think so. The emperor took control of basically a Mad Max world and just sort of slapped rockets and space armor on a lot of people.
[1:33:35] <+American_Saikyo> what is this smelly shit of a game?
[1:33:36] <huskarl_zap> NOOOOOOOO
[1:33:36] <+Bentusi1634> They worship "The Lord of Skin and Sinew", who is probably a Khorne exarch or an aspect of Khorne.
[1:33:38] <Them00n> @PatStaresAt What are the odds you continue playing this after the sponsored stream?
[1:33:43] <@mothmandraws> ye pre 40k was literally sequal to mad max
[1:33:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Man_in_the_Red Terra is a Hive city ontop of a hive city. Its the hive city all hive cities strive to be. THERE IS NO WASTELAND its all hive
[1:34:10] <ISkyHunterI> while it was mad max keep in mind they had a lot of high level tecnology
[1:34:28] <@mothmandraws> ye gotta fight the "techno barbarians"
[1:34:36] <%Taisuru> @doc_ock_rokc TERA IS THE GOLDEN SEAT OF MANKIND HERETIC

[1:35:28] <%toolofparanoia> Terra is literally one Dead Emperor away from becoming a second Eye of Terror
[1:35:28] <+pectusumbra> chems
[1:35:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Taisuru you take my words as one of discouragement. The Omnissiah approves the hive worlds. Terra is almost as beautiful as mars itself

[1:35:41] <@mothmandraws> orks
[1:35:42] <mellorolo> Pat quick, i figured out how you can become immortal! Become a voice over for a a.i. technological firm like jarvis or siri. Then you'd be able to continue by receiving update and tech advances towards your a.i. self thus after enough time has passed you can insinuate immortality when you become advance enough!
[1:35:49] <steelstwitchaccount> These spray weapons like the flamer and that acid thing seem really, really weak compared to most everything else so far.
[1:36:01] <huskarl_zap> Search the boxes pat
[1:36:02] <+Bentusi1634> Food is hard to come across on hives so most people get by on recycled people.
[1:36:02] <DSD24> Kicks the fuck ass
[1:36:03] <%toolofparanoia> As it should
[1:36:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> It kicks the fuck ass alright.
[1:36:09] <@mothmandraws> flamers are better firing into groups

[1:37:24] <mrbobuncle> @PatStaresAt you didn't loot any of the body or the battlefield!!!
[1:37:28] <@mothmandraws> either get random injury or die
[1:37:28] <%Piemen99> Aw I wanted the head to pop
[1:37:29] <DSD24> Is this like Valkyria Chronicles?
[1:37:32] <%king_wragles> @ChestMimik I think Pat can still pick her up?
[1:37:32] <@mothmandraws> and recruit another
[1:37:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Oxybe Tau have no honor!
[1:37:46] <huskarl_zap> no ap
[1:37:47] <mellorolo> @zombrocom but lightning is associated with deities and miracles
[1:37:50] <ISkyHunterI> @DSD24 yes only grimdark
[1:37:51] <PanicSwytch> Are the chances to miss shots broken like Xcom?
[1:37:59] <steelstwitchaccount> subzero got bac up!

[1:38:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Moar coomin!
[1:38:06] <$lotharrio> Tau suck. Have to recruit other races to do honorable melee battles for them.
[1:38:10] <DSD24> @ISkyHunterI That sounds hype
[1:38:12] <%king_wragles> You MIGHT want to pick up that dudes weapon
[1:38:15] <el_anglicano> Taus are extremely based
[1:38:15] <%toolofparanoia> its a COMPUTA
[1:38:16] <+MacBeyer> cogitator=computer
[1:38:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> computor
[1:38:23] <Fro5tburn> it's the thing that cogitates 4Head

[1:38:27] <steelstwitchaccount> Zekedee, what a name.
[1:38:29] <Man_in_the_Red> its not that accuracy is broken in Xcom, its that its acurate to probability and that sucks ass
[1:38:30] <@mothmandraws> looting isnt as important in story as you dont keep drops
[1:38:31] <stabbityrabbit> @mellorolo And the Night Lords. Never forget the Night Lords.

[1:39:05] <tattleworm> buy them a drink first
[1:39:06] <@mothmandraws> needs to be main person iirc
[1:39:07] <freyes5291> you cogger
[1:39:09] <+Soliloquy123> I think she's bodyblocking it
[1:39:14] <%ChestMimik> @DrHentaiPhD Zero so far
[1:39:19] <$lotharrio> Pat, stop downloading Bonzi Buddies onto the cogitator.
[1:39:19] <Them00n> Needs to be the leader
[1:39:23] <%AncelDeLambert> *march of the gladiators starts playing*
[1:39:23] <%thebonebard> sorry if youve said this before but how well does does the mechanicus ui show up on your tv if youve tried it, seems up your alley, transhumans and necrons
[1:39:31] <%SWFanatic> shoot the glass
[1:39:39] <steelstwitchaccount> IT's easy. I'll conjugate with you!
[1:39:39] <%StrawberryPantsu> COJITATE!? I HAVEN'T EVEN KISSED A GIRL...
[1:39:44] <%toolofparanoia> thats overkill
[1:39:45] <DSD24> I love Mechanicus! that game is awesome
[1:39:46] <zamzoph> melta grenade sounds like overkill
[1:39:48] <%D00msDayDan> guess what melta grenades are for
[1:39:53] <DSD24> Plus the soundtrack is amazing
[1:39:55] <AFlyingTaco1> So in the full game, does each gang get its own campaign or do you have to go with the MC Escher girls?
[1:39:58] <%StrawberryPantsu> good night everybody
[1:40:00] <%ianabstract> melta grenades are supposed to be tiny fusion bombs
[1:40:02] <%Taisuru> LUL
[1:40:03] <freyes5291> COJITATE!? I HARDLY KNOW HER!
[1:40:06] <Zombrocom> Melta grenades are for destroying tanks, that is hilarious overkill
[1:40:07] <huskarl_zap> survived a melta grenade Kappa
[1:40:08] <%ianabstract> that's a bit of a wet fart in comparison
[1:40:11] <%AncelDeLambert> her hair looks so stupid, man
[1:40:12] <ISkyHunterI> mechanicus is so good
[1:40:12] <@mothmandraws> main story is escher, the normal campaign mode is custom gangs
[1:40:12] <%toolofparanoia> with the power to... MELT
[1:40:26] <zamzoph> @toolofparanoia I get it
[1:40:31] <%ChestMimik> THE GOBLINS
[1:40:52] <@mothmandraws> search for 0 5ap to take
[1:41:02] <%AncelDeLambert> @toolofparanoia I got that reference psaSmug
[1:41:02] <+Solutha> everything is a consumable
[1:41:03] <steelstwitchaccount> Try hard.
[1:41:04] <Skottt3> None of the attacks have any impact, they might as well be using supersoakers.
[1:41:05] <@mothmandraws> tactical menu thing
[1:41:06] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> i think you heal the down one too
[1:41:07] <Daxalog> Its an action
[1:41:07] <%toolofparanoia> @zamzoph bro i miss that goofy ass ka-blam shit
[1:41:20] <+Soliloquy123> @PatStaresAt When items are stacked, grab multiple, it only costs as if you grabbed 1. If you grab them all individually you're spending AP every item
[1:41:36] <steelstwitchaccount> It's spelled just like the word "Escape"
[1:41:39] <stabbityrabbit> Yo the main story is escher?! It's nice to see women front and center in SOMETHING 40k.
[1:41:40] <%Piemen99> JUMP
[1:41:41] <@mothmandraws> or jump off the side
[1:41:44] <%Taisuru> Just jump off Kappa
[1:41:47] <sen0r_b0b> you can also rapell down
[1:41:48] <huskarl_zap> only tessera needs to evac
[1:41:50] <Baruberu> or jump
[1:42:06] <@mothmandraws> everyone has grapnels to jump downwards only, some get jump up skill
[1:42:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @stabbityrabbit you do know all the living saints are women in 40k and a ton of cadian commanders are women right?
[1:42:30] <%toolofparanoia> !necro
[1:42:30] <@Moobot> Hey check out Necromunda Underhive Wars it's like Valkyria Chronicles and Warhammer had a weird techno baby https://bit.ly/32RyoDD
[1:42:32] <Zombrocom> That's, uh... quite the tame melta grenade
[1:42:42] <%SWFanatic> balling?

[1:42:52] <Zombrocom> @doc_ock_rokc There are a couple male living saints actually though
[1:42:54] <@mothmandraws> just not at the yellow bits
[1:42:58] <steelstwitchaccount> Just jump. Get to ground faster that way.

[1:43:31] <@mothmandraws> in campaign you do, story no
[1:43:33] <stabbityrabbit> @doc_ock_rokc I'm aware, but most of 40k follows the stories of Astartes which are all male.
[1:43:38] <DartonLance> you keep nothing in the story
[1:43:40] <@mothmandraws> in campaign you wanna be a loot goblin
[1:43:41] <steelstwitchaccount> Naw, they just fall off once the level ends.

[1:46:54] <lambretime> I'm a tad disapointed that there's no chaos cult or Cawdor gang in the game...
[1:47:03] <%SWFanatic> don't give up skeleton
[1:47:04] <%kujofire990> but moth, you have to finish the campaign for more HAIR
[1:47:09] <Man_in_the_Red> Paige would love Mechanicus

[1:47:45] <@mothmandraws> my guess
[1:47:47] <lambretime> Hope so!
[1:47:50] <@mothmandraws> is the other main house gangs as dlc

[1:48:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ChestMimik Dorn would both approve and disaprove
[1:48:19] <@mothmandraws> main thing I want to see on first patch is faster enemy turns and some ai improvement

[1:53:56] <huskarl_zap> traps are optional

[2:04:07] <yeetdabsenpai69> how far is Pat?
[2:04:08] <+Pyroclase> Fallout 76 doesn't look half this good
[2:04:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Escher is clearly in. I heard they put the redeemers
[2:04:25] <sen0r_b0b> @yeetdabsenpai69 third mission of tutorial
[2:04:27] <@mothmandraws> basically they get endless overwatch till it jams
[2:04:29] <Parapattern> Fallout 76 could have been just this and been perfectly fine

[2:05:46] <Parapattern> All of these women have lead and mercury poisoning
[2:05:58] <BleedinActionMan> You need to fix the generators
[2:05:58] <+Pyroclase> It could be a tutorial thing?
[2:06:00] <@mothmandraws> ye a ton of the terrain is the gamesworkshop stuff
[2:06:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> 40k tech is old and busted you cannot repair it
[2:06:04] <@mothmandraws> I recognise the creates
[2:06:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> it's impossible
[2:06:08] <SleepySamsquanch> @BleedinActionMan Thanks! Sad to not see the creepy Delaq gang.
[2:06:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Parapattern if they are lucky its JUST led and mercury posioning
[2:06:16] <+Pyroclase> First you must appease the machine spirit
[2:06:18] <%AzureGale> tor
[2:06:20] <sen0r_b0b> no, to end it
[2:06:22] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> no

[2:06:28] <BleedinActionMan> Or the Genestealer Cults
[2:06:33] <+Tucker0603> no
[2:06:34] <+Pyroclase> It sounds like enemies will spawn every round
[2:06:36] <Baruberu> no
[2:06:39] <@mothmandraws> basically you got 4 turns to do it all while being attacked
[2:06:51] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> the mission has started already

[2:36:09] <@Moobot> Hey check out Necromunda Underhive Wars it's like Valkyria Chronicles and Warhammer had a weird techno baby https://bit.ly/32RyoDD
[2:36:12] <%SWFanatic> drop your shield
[2:36:18] <Parapattern> The difficulty is very eekum bookum
[2:36:26] <haisho> that's hive cities in a nutshell really
[2:36:36] <huskarl_zap> Heavy bolters are under powered it seems
[2:36:39] <+skylerpilot> @Ranryu692 2Snacks animated gif of her saying it is really good
[2:36:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> E E K U M B O K U M
[2:37:03] <shaddydaddyo> im glad korone is bringing attention to banjo kazooie, its my favorite game
[2:37:06] <lambishly> does this game have no music?
[2:37:10] <mrbobuncle> This is like a really evil Xcom mod that's out to get you from the start
[2:37:11] <@mothmandraws> heavy weapons nuke barricades
[2:37:19] <lambishly> or is it suuuper quiet
[2:37:46] <%bigmacjack12> im just waiting for them to add gang van saar
[2:37:52] <+Pyroclase> Yeah I'm struggling to hear BGM but that could just be how Pat prefers to mix audio
[2:37:52] <BleedinActionMan> there's music
[2:37:57] <%toolofparanoia> @lambishly its twitch being quiet
[2:38:00] <$RealThiele> too rowdy
[2:38:13] <+jetjagger222> fucking munitorium canisters everywhere
[2:38:13] <+Pyroclase> or it's just... really understated, but that seems like a waste for 40k
[2:38:19] <zach13> Hell, Pat. Thanks for all the entertainment. Really makes quarantine a bit more bearable. I don’t have a Twitter to tell ya!
[2:38:32] <+jetjagger222> its a shame cause mechanicus had a baller-ass OST
[2:38:37] <Chatterbox1991> is that Lava?
[2:38:42] <%ScrawnyFlannelman> ScrawnyFlannelman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Is this another example of Games Workshop remembering they can make computer games out of their tabletop games? Necromunda always looked cool, but I never saw anyone play it.
[2:38:45] <Chatterbox1991> falling from the heavens?
[2:38:57] <Parapattern> Mechanicus OST is superb
[2:39:14] <$Vineslop_Tod> What are the odds Pat forgets that mine is there.
[2:39:15] <%thebonebard> i feel like people have forgotten that not every tactics game is a xcom
[2:39:33] <Chatterbox1991> I would prefer if they were, honestly
[2:39:39] <%ScrawnyFlannelman> oh gosh, bonebard
[2:39:50] <Chatterbox1991> @patstaresat are you gonna check out IRON harvest?
[2:39:58] <$RealThiele> you were bloodvorne
[2:40:05] <+jetjagger222> this engine would actually work well for an infinity adaptation
[2:40:07] <%ScrawnyFlannelman> if people thought every tactics game needed to be XCOM, I'd be REALLY upset about FiraXCOM
[2:40:18] <%DensityD> you take an advantage and YOU PUSH THAT SHIT IN ON THEM
[2:40:45] <huskarl_zap> out of range
[2:41:01] <sen0r_b0b> youre not using the deadeye atm
[2:41:09] <+Shacklebox> hey @PatStaresAt is there a motion blur toggle in this game? It makes me sick and I hate it
[2:41:10] <+jetjagger222> this kinda reminds me a bit of vagrant story
[2:41:12] <%SWFanatic> nani?
[2:41:32] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> tyhe wepon is not sniper
[2:41:32] <sen0r_b0b> oh idk then. we can't see the bottom left
[2:41:54] <huskarl_zap> resisted a bolter
[2:42:05] <%DensityD> rowdy boys suck shit, it seems
[2:42:25] <+jetjagger222> same principle as the catachan wifebeater armor save
[2:42:41] <%SWFanatic> not to mix metaphors
[2:42:41] <@Moobot> Hey check out Necromunda Underhive Wars it's like Valkyria Chronicles and Warhammer had a weird techno baby https://bit.ly/32RyoDD
[2:42:42] <kozakthered77> mby this factions version of a deadeye is just more accurate instead of being accurate? they don't look like the type to be marksman
[2:42:51] <%Piemen99> NOOOOO
[2:42:55] <+MacBeyer> a lady sized car with chainswords
[2:43:06] <kozakthered77> instead of being shrpshooters*
[2:43:11] <%DensityD> jackin the spuds
[2:43:12] <Manwad> that sounds dirty
[2:43:21] <%toolofparanoia> melee time!
[2:43:31] <+Shacklebox> only swing with one hand

[2:51:14] <@mothmandraws> in normal campaign would be better to leave and take the loss
[2:51:22] <%TheWinged7> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:51:25] <popcultureaficionado> chainswords are chainswords but what to a mortal is a bastard sword is a shorts word to a spacemarine

[2:57:06] <@mothmandraws> pokemon stands
[2:57:06] <@commanderclaw> That's called a C'tan

[2:57:19] <+pkmamsters> I can't wait for the secret guest, Randy Pitchboy
[2:57:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> C'tans are definitely stands
[2:57:34] <%DukeMoose> the hive spires are built around MASSIVE Thermal spikes that drill deep into the planets core for infinite energy
[2:57:35] <usotaku013666> Orks have a collective stand called WWAAAAAGGGHHHH!
[2:57:45] <%Aztec50> Necrons can just BE stands
[2:57:53] <+jetjagger222> i like the tau stand; gun
[2:57:55] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> i mean stands ARE just a manifestation of psychic prowess right? stands could be achieved by anything psyionically strong enough
[2:58:11] <Mr_Rakjo> @PatStaresAt one of the best thing i read about 40k is the octarius war where a Inquisitor had the great idea that make a Tyrannid Fleet Crash into an Ork controlled Solar System. yknow the 2 races that get better the more they fight and they have basically limitless numbers
