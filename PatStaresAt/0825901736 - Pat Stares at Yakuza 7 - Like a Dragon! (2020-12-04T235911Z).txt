[0:12:28] <%PigGuy800> zangeif used swift it was super effective
[0:12:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat I wasn't here last night to point it out, and I'm not sure if you noticed, but in the play from the opening Arakawa is acting as a woman who became a murderer to avenge her father. It's like poetry, it rhymes.
[0:12:35] <%BoxNavy> STOP
[0:12:40] <Aydarkzero> dogs are fast
[0:12:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat's favorite bedroom move is the Gorilla Press Kappa
[0:12:47] <%AzureGale> Remember Rufus
[0:12:49] <%Alazull> Food motivated dogs are extemely fast
[0:12:49] <%Bailey__gaming> Zangief I'd new speed zaar
[0:12:52] <%Zeif00> what's that on your shirt?
[0:12:52] <redrins> he is not fat, he is MUSCULAR and fat like a sumo wrestler
[0:12:54] <%Alazull> In limited cases
[0:12:55] <theanora1> Alligators are very fat and very fast
[0:12:55] <Maleicus> they are just lazy
[0:12:59] <%Broken_Sonex> They use their fat lumbering image to fool you
[0:13:00] <%spokensun> speeeed
[0:13:01] <Visorak6> Reminder that zangief is a block of pure muscle
[0:13:05] <Aydarkzero> my dog was 14 and she still could zoom

[0:13:08] <%sonofthedeepsouth> REALLY?
[0:13:08] <%SirGO0SE> is just maths
[0:13:08] <Profmcstevie> Large can be fast, large simply struggles to change direction
[0:13:09] <olaksi> centipedes famously break the sound barrier
[0:13:09] <%Alazull> Get out

[0:13:28] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SNAKES R FAST AS FUCK
[0:13:30] <%ChrisPlaysThing> sneks are fast with no legs
[0:13:30] <%CzeekyPlays> What if that leg is a tire
[0:13:32] <Maleicus> pat only has 1 leg?

[0:13:39] <%Cozy90> PAT WOULD YOU HAVE WINGS OR LEGS?
[0:13:39] <redrins> what animal has 1 legs?
[0:13:40] <%SunnyVarietyPack> centaurs are hot
[0:13:41] <%Alazull> If you walk on hands, four legs
[0:13:42] <%YakumoYomi> Horse butt, Pat
[0:13:42] <fuji_92> either 0 or 4 legs
[0:13:44] <TheDeceasedJester> how about a really fat dog?

[0:23:27] <Zebroneath> I mean, when Pat streamed RDR2 one day early, it lead me to buying the game.
[0:23:27] <%Stratiotai2> did you pull out your internet fame card and rub it in their face

[0:23:32] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I find it interesting
[0:23:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Or it'll make me return by pre-order if the game is actually bad.
[0:23:33] <%AzureGale> It matters when it's a game people LIKE
[0:23:34] <theanora1> Also Woolie can't get it early, so that's another reason
[0:23:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I give a shit, if you dont stream a day early, im dropping you forever
[0:23:35] <+michingmallecho> He’s right but at the same time...you know LUL
[0:23:35] <%Agami23> its because pat is transparent about stuff
[0:23:35] <NitronStreams> Pat just wants to see all the day zero bugs

[0:23:46] <TheBlankAce> Its a really interesting thing in how it works
[0:23:47] <Goodvibes99508> futrue influencer jobs might care how many times one streams early
[0:23:47] <%BoxNavy> everyone talks about it

[0:23:49] <leinadtonu> Corporate Pat.
[0:23:49] <%DappercatEsquire> that clout gets deposited into his bank account
[0:23:50] <ShichiNoBushi> What if I want to be an influencer and get free games early and become popular?
[0:23:50] <%Bailey__gaming> They Have expressly said no one can stream it till EVERYONE HAS it
[0:23:50] <%ultimatetotoro> also it's business
[0:23:51] <%Stratiotai2> its hard being a big popular streamer man
[0:23:51] <fuji_92> I like these talks
[0:23:51] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Transparency is great
[0:23:54] <+VoytekBus> pat has never been an asshole
[0:23:55] <+tigerfang86> its interesting for sure
[0:23:55] <+loukemia83> Paige, there is MORTGAGE to pay
[0:23:55] <Aydarkzero> it mostly depends on the game no?
[0:23:56] <Blank9> it's not even clout, you'd get big views showing big game early
[0:23:58] <+MrMcCrabby> I like hearing about industry stuff
[0:23:58] <%captainpodock> I'm getting the game early, life is so hard!
[0:24:00] <+jiggy_snipe> and Woolie streams games 10 years later
[0:24:01] <%medusasghost> Pat Stares At Industry

[0:24:51] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Pat how do you feel about Vinny getting a suspension for playing a mod that showed a titty for a few seconds, but Cyberpunk is about to come out and is probably gonna have extreme nudity and that’s apparently fine?

[0:25:57] <%Pukenasty> he's influenced me to purchase games he has streamed
[0:25:58] <%Stratiotai2> thats a diffcult question with many variables
[0:25:58] <dretheroboticdeer> In a way
[0:25:58] <%stygzing> Pat's a great entertainer
[0:25:59] <%penitentpendant> I am playing Like A Dragon right now because I bought it after watching Pat play it. Currently in Chapter 9.
[0:25:59] <%BoxNavy> he influenced me to get games so yes he is an influencer

[0:25:59] <TheAdMerlin> I buy what less handsome me plays

[0:26:03] <%Razputin217> DARK INFLUENCER

[0:26:16] <xbb1024> no you don't, that how you get a corrupt monopoly
[0:26:16] <UlriktheSlayer1> without your playthroughs of yakuza i would have never known about the games probably so thanks?
[0:26:19] <%patriotrenegade> To me he's just the funny balding ginger man with the broken girlfriend who is also funny
[0:26:20] <leinadtonu> Pat is orb
[0:26:20] <+Wilabeen1997> Technically speaking yeah I think Pat is
[0:26:21] <SCIENCE_25> Dark influencer class unlocked.
[0:26:21] <+luckyturtelle> Yeah, I mean to the extent that if Pat enjoys a game I probably will too, so if he's talking up a game I'm more likely to check it out
[0:26:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You'd hope that Twitch would get together with these companies and implement a system.
[0:26:22] <%Bailey__gaming> Pat is many thjngs

[1:01:10] <%KineKithZen> When One Guy gets a job in influencer outreach
[1:01:18] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Honestly being an influencer reminds me of dealing with sales reps at a restaurant. We're always working them for free shit, they give it to us for advertising for them and also to try to get us to buy more things from them.
[1:01:22] <Joygineer> Atlus avoiding chances to make money? How silly, there's no way there's a company that literally keeps doing that
[1:01:26] <%condemned_15> @cherryceecee well the guy is a conservative nutjob that was calling the writer a corporate sell out
[1:01:33] <%SirGO0SE> this is all just an elaborate scam for them to get twitter followers WOW

[1:15:30] <+secretspud> I love playing ahead of the stream. I am now excite.
[1:15:40] <%Monkeyweed21> how did you cheat this time
[1:15:42] <%Alazull> Frandship
[1:15:42] <trasherxl> I likewhen weird time stuff happens in the books. Like in Stephen King's story 1406, key events take somewhere around 15 minutes by main characters approximation, but if you account it by actual description, its barely 5 minutes.
[1:15:44] <%QueequegTheater> @Blackleafx official. The English dub is also *significanty* better
[1:15:44] <%Blackleafx> drinky time
[1:15:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> @polter_ge1st Well. If it wasn't we sure know how don't we LUL
[1:15:46] <huskarl_zap> MAX DRUNK
[1:15:47] <UlriktheSlayer1> so how much off screen cheatin you done?
[1:15:50] <NitronStreams> every single time Pat starts wiht "so.." I expect "I did some grinding"
[1:15:53] <%QueequegTheater> *Better than the original dub
[1:15:55] <+jinkokinko> oh hell yeah, hit me with that himbo hero baby!
[1:15:55] <%patriotrenegade> i do not
[1:16:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> you pissed them to max level?
[1:16:02] <trasherxl> *1408
[1:16:07] <UlriktheSlayer1> BEST BOYS
[1:16:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:16:18] <%Cozy90> Zhao is best
[1:16:21] <Maleicus> you really chose a poor timing to grind
[1:16:23] <%shurtal> Zhao's look reminds me of Mark from Aunty Donna
[1:16:24] <+Soliloquy123> @PatStaresAt Haven't tuned in to your Yakuza 7 streams in a while, how 'involved' are these new party members in the story? Like I remember you saying the business lady never shows up at all
[1:16:27] <%barkon345> shouldnt his hair have gone back to normal by now?
[1:16:37] <ryowildfire> isnt this the same guy who voice acted prompto in ff15?
[1:16:44] <Joygineer> I dont think I'll ever get used to his hobofro hair
[1:16:45] <Maleicus> the arena is nuts with its exp
[1:16:46] <%StaceMcGate> yeah, perfect grinding spot opens next chapter
[1:16:46] <gutterfeast> That same ice clinking sound, all the time....
[1:16:48] <%AlphaRayAllen> I believe so
[1:16:48] <%QueequegTheater> Do I have time to go get dinner before certain characters show up
[1:16:57] <%Blackleafx> @barkon345 no but funny tho
[1:17:10] <%AtlasMcCoy> Japanese media seems to love that ice clinking sound
[1:17:12] <SomeAsianDood> @BigShay93 zhao's played by Robbie Daymond
[1:17:19] <%Blackleafx> @QueequegTheater dont think so, he did basically all the sidestories last stream so its likely straight into plot after this
[1:17:19] <%Dunmarkh> put him in the ground
[1:17:21] <Joygineer> it's like his hair is actively trying to escape his head
[1:17:23] <%toastybites> O

[1:19:40] <$Skelemungus> BROTHER
[1:19:40] <%toastybites> it'll literally get you killed
[1:19:41] <%Alazull> It's that Zhao can't bring himself to hate Mabuchi

[1:19:51] <TheAdMerlin> But pat, you can't be gay in Japan!
[1:19:53] <%Alazull> But he also realizes that Mabuchi is an asshole
[1:19:53] <%sumrand0> this is Naruto x Sasuke levels of toxic friendship
[1:19:56] <PsychoPearl> There's some sexual tension between them LUL

[1:20:30] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> psaDogchamp
[1:20:31] <%CzeekyPlays> Vergil?
[1:20:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because it sounds like you read it.

[1:20:42] <daniphofani> !motivated
[1:20:44] <Space_Pagan> HE'S MOTIVATED
[1:20:52] <%AlphaRayAllen> They recap so much in these links
[1:20:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yong Soon Kim is no longer his real name.
[1:20:53] <%AncelDeLambert> nssgebledahmumblemumblemumble
[1:20:54] <%KikioJane> Give us the Ichiban harem
[1:20:58] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god I HATE this voice
[1:20:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He IS Joon-Gi Han now.
[1:21:03] <+Wilabeen1997> Faux Korean Vergil
[1:21:05] <NitronStreams> It was "Yeonsu Kim" I think
[1:21:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> gamer bro
[1:21:09] <CaptainFukouDa> MOTIVATED
[1:21:13] <%HedgehogGames1> His real name is Korean Dante
[1:21:14] <%KineKithZen> Sun-Wukong Cho
[1:21:18] <CrmznOgre> Vergil?
[1:21:22] <%sumrand0> it's because of all the plastic sugary
[1:21:39] <+estefufu> kergil
[1:21:46] <%toastybites> didnt their eyes burn down
[1:21:48] <%pipboy344> All I see is Nanba at bleach japan then the stream ends
[1:22:00] <cardamomo88> WE ARE BROS NOW
[1:22:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I love how even the "cool" guys in the party, Han and Zhou, are still losers. Han is a body double who wasn't even there when his master died. Zhou is a failed crime boss that just abandoned his gang after a coup.
[1:22:25] <%sumrand0> hahahaha pipboy u got catching up to do

[1:23:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @SomeAsianDood You mean the failed CEO of her father's company that had to get a stranger to fix her mistakes.
[1:23:32] <CaptainFukouDa> he just wants to be the storm that is approaching
[1:23:34] <+Chronobot> Can ichiban really be a yakuza protagonist if he doesnt slaughter the jeongweon like 5 times

[1:25:45] <%logoth_> Nanba acting goofy is weird
[1:25:48] <%sumrand0> Wow these bars are sadder than a guy dating his realdoll
[1:25:51] <Joygineer> paying for girls to be hype about you drinking seems next level depressing then regular whores

[1:27:43] <+Chronobot> he said HNG
[1:27:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> @pksilent01 theres too much in the game to translate so they only do main story side quests and a bit more
[1:27:53] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Ichiban truly has the values of a proper hobo. It doesn't matter how gross it is, do anything for booze.
[1:27:53] <%HedgehogGames1> Who just takes an abandoned drink off a bar?

[1:29:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Outside of the Han persona.

[1:29:38] <%sumrand0> weird quirk
[1:29:42] <+ZipperHands> it would probably be easier to tell if this game had SMAA like the Y0 and Kiwami PC ports
[1:29:43] <redial_nick> this game looks better than 6?

[1:30:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> These guys are terrorists.
[1:30:28] <%sumrand0> Manners ain't worth much to murderers
[1:30:30] <primarch_lupercal> maybe theyre born here? @PatStaresAt
[1:30:31] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Pat, just because they're hardcore murderers doesn't mean they need to be rude.
[1:30:32] <%bluescreen1988> professionals have standards
[1:30:35] <huskarl_zap> time to shoot up the street
[1:30:37] <+ZipperHands> They gonna get their knife boots out like Kiwami 2?
[1:30:38] <+secretspud> Fortunatly you power leveled, so we're good
[1:30:40] <%HedgehogGames1> How considerate of them to make sure Ichi stays in the loop.
[1:30:41] <hassanico2> Did Pat progress the story?
[1:30:47] <seaechiowai> they are second genners man. japanese could be easier for them
[1:30:56] <%Mr_Pylon> they're a crime cult
[1:31:01] <%Dunmarkh> @hassanico2 not today
[1:31:02] <@SoFarFetched> Just think to those animes where it OBVIOUSLY takes place in England but conveniently everyone speaks Japanese Kappa

[1:31:05] <KaitlynnHere> So is this why he’d up and left a bar?! So he could fight a gang by himself?

[1:31:52] <%sumrand0> biker gangs are babies by comparison
[1:31:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Do you think you'll do a Legend playthrough of this game off-stream? It's basically a different game on Legend difficulty because all the enemies are lvl 99.
[1:31:56] <+supersonic21> To be fair joong ji had a strip club boxing arena
[1:32:06] <%madmanrambler> high agility is busted
[1:32:06] <RunaRaseri> wait... this game is turn based?
[1:32:13] <ketchuo13> He is your fastest party member
[1:32:16] <ryowildfire> joon aint no joke
[1:32:20] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt Joon-gi has super-high Agility, so he's fast as shit.
[1:32:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Han's multi-turns is why he's the most OP party member.
[1:32:22] <CrmznOgre> wow this is REALLY different

[1:35:33] <KaitlynnHere> Hey can we go back to the bar now?
[1:35:38] <RunaRaseri> I should have got in here earlier... I honestly missed most everything about this... except for the clip of @PatStaresAt talking about... what was it... 'business universe'?
[1:35:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Reminder: These are hard core terrorists that probably shouldn't be brought back together
[1:35:42] <Joygineer> I really never ever expected yakuza to start form shifting into persona

[1:35:46] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BUT SAD MUSIC
[1:35:48] <olaksi> Wholesome terrorist family
[1:35:55] <+Chronobot> Jung hi is hot, so they're morally grey
[1:35:58] <Blank9> they deserve a crime home too
[1:35:58] <cardamomo88> WHO CARES PLOT SAID
[1:35:58] <devanmuse> And you're a Yakuza. It's hard to play the moral high ground in this story

[1:36:11] <%Cozy90> WHY COULDENT YOU TELL ICHIBAN!?
[1:36:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Is this guy going to fill in the concussed, unconscious others lying behind him?
[1:36:15] <%sumrand0> These guys are IRA style terrorists: car bombs blow up a block to kill 1 dude
[1:36:18] <%madmanrambler> These guys are part of the group in 6 though right? not 2?
[1:36:18] <%patriotrenegade> No these guys are different
[1:36:19] <%the22cstomp> korean jesus
[1:36:20] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt but they are the Stray Jingweon Pat
[1:36:21] <colzack_> Yakuza 2 was like 14 years ago so they could be not as crazy
[1:36:21] <ketchuo13> Well, that was awhile. These are probably the ones from 6 I guess
[1:36:21] <%NopeBadguy> The whole theme here is that Ijincho's grey zone has become a safe haven for people with nowhere else to go.
[1:36:22] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SAVE THE IRA
[1:36:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But we can't just leave them behind Pat!
[1:36:25] <Blank9> those jingweon are mainlanders ex-special forces ones, not second generation/strays
[1:36:25] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:36:26] <TheHardM> The Jingweon killed Ryuji Goda and that's unforgiveable.
[1:36:26] <gungniir_> remember thats when there was like five "just kidding, im on this guys side now!"s in a tow
[1:36:26] <+ZipperHands> weren't some of the original Jingeown back in the 80s just Korean immigrants?
[1:36:27] <KaitlynnHere> They’re misguided
[1:36:28] <%reonome> THE YAKUZA ARE NICE GUYS

[1:36:35] <%Broken_Sonex> I GUESS YOU ARE MY LITTLE POG CHAMP
[1:36:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> These strays just tried to kill you.
[1:36:37] <%Blackleafx> BACK TO DRINKING
[1:36:38] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt The whole theme here is that Ijincho's grey zone has become a safe haven for people with nowhere else to go.
[1:36:42] <colzack_> Like by that logic Joon Gi is also messed up
[1:36:42] <%patriotrenegade> Yes, but any crime can be forgiven, just remember Naruto @PatStaresAt
[1:36:43] <+tigerfang86> HES SO COOL
[1:36:45] <%gksnipa> its like the brotherhood of steel in fo3
[1:36:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> MAYBE THEY'LL FOLLOW UP ON THIS IN YAKUZA 8?
[1:36:48] <$Skelemungus> its fine pat
[1:36:50] <nellysian> YAKUZA VERGIL
[1:36:55] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt presumably they're a bunch of strays that failed
[1:36:56] <Joygineer> bring the crazy terrorists together again. Mission Accomplished?
[1:36:58] <fuji_92> HE'S SO COOL
[1:36:58] <RunaRaseri> so how does grabbing stuff and combos work?
[1:37:04] <KaitlynnHere> They’re just good guys who did bad things @patstaresat
[1:37:06] <huskarl_zap> North Koreans orrrrrr?
[1:37:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:37:08] <+BloodyBurney> It feels like Y7 has big themes of criminal orgs being good for society, or something
[1:37:09] <%off_to_work_we_go> well in yakuza despite being called yakuza you barely ever play as a yakuza
[1:37:14] <cardamomo88> HAHAHA
[1:37:17] <%sumrand0> Man the Persona series really ripped off Yakuza 7 those games really copied a lot from this game LUL

[1:37:45] <%KineKithZen> Trashbag of honor
[1:37:49] <SomeAsianDood> @RunaRaseri grabbing stuff is context sensitive, just be nearby. Followups require a certain level of S link or quickly attacking after someone else attacks
[1:37:50] <huskarl_zap> You don't scuff this style
[1:37:50] <CaptainFukouDa> m'honor
[1:37:53] <+Mitchellsocks> There's no way he has Joon-Gi's build under that trashbag

[1:52:27] <+tigerfang86> yakuza fights are already cakewalks
[1:52:29] <+taltalheights> Pat streams much like a cooking show having a prepped load. Much appreciated
[1:52:29] <+tigerfang86> not a big deal
[1:52:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> As someone who has beaten this game, it's always a cakewalk if you've done all the substories as they appear.
[1:52:35] <%RealThiele> budget go brrrrr
[1:52:35] <cocomoloko> dont worry, the cake will end
[1:52:35] <gungniir_> what was the last story boss pat fought?

[1:52:42] <%bluescreen1988> yakuza was a never a hard series
[1:52:42] <+supersonic21> overleveling in this game does not make it eaiser
[1:52:44] <%coreyyotto> There are still a few bosses that might be able to give him a run for his money, don't worry
[1:52:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> STREAM FOREVER THO
[1:52:44] <%off_to_work_we_go> @saraizarai you keep skills from all jobs regardless of what current job you have
[1:52:44] <colzack_> The fights being easy doesn't make it any less fun so that's alright
[1:52:45] <%penitentpendant> @j0hnnydonuts Cheers
[1:52:45] <+SilverDevilfish> At least Pat isn't playing baseball for 3 hours Kappa
[1:52:47] <%PomegranateKing> Melted pat brain is just one step above paige sundown brain
[1:52:49] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt PAT I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T RUIN DS3 BY NOT OVERLEVELLING
[1:52:52] <%BoxNavy> play it urself if you hate how hes playing :)
[1:52:52] <+CookieCutter007> the cyberpunk deadline
[1:52:53] <Louie_Salmon> The weight of eyes is too much
[1:52:53] <californaya> I want to see story, not fights. Aside from the silly summons.
[1:52:54] <MasterTonberry23> you know folks, if you dont like how pat plays, you could, i dunno, play it yourself Kappa
[1:52:55] <+Seitine> I'd rather them be cakewalk honestly instead of trapped in fights all the time.
[1:52:57] <%madmanrambler> did not friggin feel that way in one upcoming boss fight
[1:52:58] <+BloodyBurney> later fights are long af without grinding
[1:53:01] <+Javaa01> Well you'll see about that
[1:53:02] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Legend mode is beating my ass
[1:53:03] <captain_demo779> ...I assume this means the VODs aren’t going up on YT?

[1:53:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat will still hit THE WALL
[1:53:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IN THAT ORDER?
[1:53:27] <%krispen_wa> Did Pat just start playing the game?
[1:53:29] <primarch_lupercal> is this "pee" or actually pee
[1:53:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Both of them.
[1:53:29] <%coreyyotto> The real Pat Stares At doesn't start until two hours in. Everyone knows this.
[1:53:32] <%patriotrenegade> I just spam Tauriner and Toughness in boss fights with Kiryu
[1:53:32] <KaitlynnHere> And then honk your pee pee
[1:53:33] <+SilverDevilfish> "So I found another save file where I'm L 50" Kappa

[1:53:36] <%spokensun> HONK
[1:53:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There are 2 boss fights he will do tonight that Pat WILL have trouble with.
[1:53:38] <j0hnnydonuts> metalkHey metalkPaul

[1:53:58] <+AbnormalVoid> jermaFireman
[1:53:58] <jorniev> CAN WE CONVINCE THE CYBERPUNK GUYS TO GIVE CODES TO PAIGE JUST TO PISS OFF PAT?
[1:53:59] <%doctordunno> Honuka
[1:54:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ironically, Pat did not grind enough to blow through those walls.
[1:54:04] <cheerthisdan> It says something that this is probably genuinely the most difficult Yakuza game and it's still easy
[1:54:06] <%PomegranateKing> Pat will one day state "Crazy Talk cannot be controlled" with complete conviction, causing Crazy Talk to activate and give him full control over the powers
[1:54:07] <j0hnnydonuts> jwongCYC jwongOPTIC jwongOPTIC jwongBLAST luygBoom uctvKisses
[1:54:22] <jorniev> @PomegranateKing OP
[1:54:24] <+SilverDevilfish> Ssssh don't let him know
[1:54:24] <cardamomo88> HA
[1:54:36] <%off_to_work_we_go> I hate grinding as a concept. I should never have to go looking for enemies in order to progress. imo
[1:54:39] <+taltalheights> I fear Crazy Talk Requiem
[1:54:39] <%LadyRarityV> LadyRarityV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Your streams have been giving me the Yakuza brainworms again and I'm living for it. Keep on keeping on! <3
[1:54:40] <captain_demo779> @queequegtheater just...if there was an an entire other Yakuza stream and the vod isn’t there yet. How fast do they generally get released?
[1:54:41] <%RealThiele> legally this code must only be used by one peach saliva, NOT pat
[1:54:43] <@Pandora_Prime> Paige is
[1:54:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think that would count as controlling crazy talk
[1:54:56] <%QueequegTheater> @captain_demo779 two days after the stream
[1:55:01] <%DappercatEsquire> I just hope all the grinding doesn't let him blow past the two big spikes, I feel like they really had impact because you felt outclassed.
[1:55:02] <%QueequegTheater> He streamed yesterday
[1:55:14] <captain_demo779> So tomorrow then? Got it...
[1:55:20] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah only way to catch up currently is if you're subbed
[1:55:24] <@SoFarFetched> to catch twitch VODs
[1:55:30] <@SoFarFetched> if not subbed,you have to wait for the youtube uploads.

[2:23:07] <%Wallabri> WELL...
[2:23:08] <KaitlynnHere> WHY ARE YOU NOT DEAD?!
[2:23:08] <%ghostmcfly6> He could buy my organ
[2:23:08] <skeletonknifefight> the lung store
[2:23:09] <%sonofthedeepsouth> AWESOME ORGAN HARVEST
[2:23:10] <Saltmeisterr> HOW DOES THAT WORK
[2:23:11] <animeshaquilleoneil> lungs is legs
[2:23:14] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The lung is korean.
[2:23:14] <brachydios777> OH
[2:23:14] <%Blackleafx> @QueequegTheater he didnt have paralysis, he had organ failure
[2:23:16] <AwkwardSenpai> He was in the wheelchair for weak organs, aka his lungs
[2:23:17] <%doctordunno> He was too weak to walk, he wasn't like, paralyzed
[2:23:18] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Right, he couldn't walk because of organ failure making him too weak.
[2:23:19] <+FackuIkari> HOW THE FUCK A LUNG FIXES YOUR SPINE?!
[2:23:19] <%Piemen99> of ya that's kinda ture
[2:23:20] <%PomegranateKing> The guy he got it from couldn't breaf
[2:23:21] <TheHardM> He didn't have a spine issue, he had a respiratory problem.
[2:23:23] <MasterTonberry23> THE US ONCE SAVED A REAL LIFE YAKUZA BOSS NOT EVEN JOKINg
[2:23:24] <london_flexing> There is how our healthcare works, yes
[2:23:26] <Blank9> his legs themselves weren't broken
[2:23:27] <%Grimlockfly> I literally can't believe the Soapland sat like that as a pile of rubble for 20 years in a city where every game is about real estate. I feel like we get a new Chinatown every 25 minutes!
[2:23:27] <%Blackleafx> AGAIN GUYS, HE DOESNT HAVE PARAYLSIS, HE HAD ORGAN FAILURe
[2:23:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He couldn't walk because he had severe pneumonia as a child. It wasn't that his legs couldn't move.
[2:23:28] <%EternalJedi> st_jimmy456 respiratory issue, couldn't get enough oxygen to stand and walk
[2:23:28] <+natjen8> Guys he head weak organs, he wasnt paralyzed
[2:23:29] <KaitlynnHere> I thought he’d fucking died
[2:23:30] <CassidyAlacrity> What fantasy race are Americans?
[2:23:31] <bobbyratlair> his new lung is so good he can have a sick ass boss fight now
[2:23:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They couldn't support his weight.
[2:23:32] <%Piemono> You can do that in Japan too
[2:23:32] <+sillyschlub> You know what chalk up to yakuzie magic
[2:23:34] <%QueequegTheater> @Blackleafx THAT'S NOT A THING
[2:23:37] <AwkwardSenpai> His spine was never the problem
[2:23:37] <%furiousfurioso> chat there's plenty of reasons why this makes sense... needing a wheelchair doesn't automatically mean paralyzed
[2:23:38] <cardamomo88> BUT YOUR DADY HELP YOU
[2:23:39] <+tigerfang86> he had a respatory problem that meant he couldn't walk without getting owned guys
[2:23:39] <%QueequegTheater> THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS
[2:23:40] <cardboardboots> his legs were never crippled he had weak lungs
[2:23:41] <+loukemia83> This guy has big FUCK YOU DAD energy
[2:23:41] <+BloodyBurney> his legs were never fucked up, he was physically weak from organ failure, new lungs mean better food for organs
[2:23:42] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @FackuIkari The problem wasn't his spine, he had organ failure that made him too weak to walk.
[2:23:44] <+Trash5DGod> Just because you are wheelchair bound doesn't mean your legs don't work.
[2:23:46] <+SenorCounter> He ain't wrong
[2:23:46] <%Fooguwu> he wants to recruit ichi for sure
[2:23:49] <%SunnyVarietyPack> What?
[2:23:50] <%NopeBadguy> There's a wha?
[2:23:51] <%EternalJedi> FackuIkari need oxygen to make muscles go
[2:23:52] <toxicgad> I mean, lung transplants are real lol
[2:23:55] <+FleshFriend> smug face
[2:23:55] <%coreyyotto> keep watching
[2:23:56] <KaitlynnHere> Get it, he’s a chair now
[2:23:58] <redrins> Kappa
[2:24:00] <tusk_act4> Kappa
[2:24:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He legitimately wants Ichiban to say he's happy for him.
[2:24:02] <%st_jimmy456> @EternalJedi that's fair. But in my defense that was not how they presented it at all
[2:24:02] <+tigerfang86> YES
[2:24:04] <%Blackleafx> The Omi probably did
[2:24:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He doesn't understand that he's a scumbag.
[2:24:07] <enfield001> Le smug face
[2:24:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SUPER GRATEFUL
[2:24:09] <%Blackleafx> Kappa

[2:30:29] <%doctordunno> BANG
[2:30:30] <colzack_> And thats why nobody heard it
[2:30:30] <%ojrmk1> Gun'll still go off dude. Even if he was strong enough to hold the slide, which he wouldn't be. It just wouldn't chamber another round.
[2:30:31] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> he waited for the noise!
[2:30:31] <BrickleBork> 2001 PogChamp
[2:30:31] <%medusasghost> i mean that's assisted suicide at that point

[2:30:33] <SaltyAzteca> There's a gunshot there
[2:30:33] <%AzureGale> GOTEM
[2:30:34] <stevenlambchops> This man could've been a Yakuza game protagonist but Masato killed him
[2:30:34] <cardamomo88> WHAT ABANG
[2:30:35] <+pectusumbra> Yakuza does a good job of making the villains have good reasons for being why they are
[2:30:35] <CelestialCage> 3
[2:30:35] <+SilverDevilfish> "What are you going to do shoot me?" - Man who was shot

[2:30:48] <+BloodyBurney> Masato is just Nishikiyama 2
[2:30:48] <+Soliloquy123> @PatStaresAt So technically you were right about there being an explosion!
[2:30:51] <cheerthisdan> DED
[2:30:51] <circular7> HahaThisisfine
[2:30:52] <%penitentpendant> "Where was Ichi" asks the guy on the phone
[2:30:52] <huskarl_zap> What your thinking of is the chamber being reloaded it doesnt affect the hammer
[2:30:53] <+Trash5DGod> dayuuuum
[2:30:54] <Saltmeisterr> DAMN
[2:30:55] <bobbyratlair> not bad for a yakuza backstory tbh
[2:30:55] <+sillyschlub> whoops
[2:30:56] <Visorak6> yikes
[2:30:58] <AMaidIndeed> So Kamarocho...is Tojo clan turf at the time of the killing?

[2:30:59] <%Blackleafx> Man he went flying
[2:30:59] <+TurnipKupo> GG
[2:31:00] <+tigerfang86> Nishiki the sequel
[2:31:02] <brachydios777> Sup Nishki
[2:31:02] <californaya> that dude was asking for it
[2:31:02] <+dante_must_die_exe> OH MAN
[2:31:02] <akitanito> rubber bullets
[2:31:02] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Oh my god is he dead
[2:31:04] <mothmal> he called sawashiro...
[2:31:04] <+Javaa01> Oh hey I think I can see his childhood memories on that wall, neat
[2:31:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> oopsie
[2:31:04] <+tigerfang86> NISHIKI MARK TWO
[2:31:04] <Blank9> poor guy
[2:31:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "what are you gonna do, shoot me?" - man who was shot
[2:31:05] <%BoxNavy> DEAD
[2:31:05] <+Snektor> What are you going to do, shoot me - says the man about to be shot
[2:31:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Popped
[2:31:05] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Nishikiyama 2.0
[2:31:07] <%NopeBadguy> The Fireworks
[2:31:07] <%kewlmyc> What are you going to do, shoot me?
[2:31:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> so does he owe Jo?
[2:31:08] <Zarkith> That's how guns work
[2:31:08] <+ianabstract> Fireworks baby
[2:31:09] <colzack_> Cause fireworks I guess
[2:31:10] <%Maids4lyfe> the fireworks
[2:31:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You said there was going to be an explosion when the countdown ended.
[2:31:11] <+AbnormalVoid> fireworks
[2:31:11] <+CannonHeroBrett> WEAK TO GUN
[2:31:11] <+FackuIkari> Nishiki 2
[2:31:11] <%KineKithZen> Man who said "shoot me" gets shot, news at 11
[2:31:12] <+TurnipKupo> HE HAD IT COMING
[2:31:12] <ssks123> the fireworks masked the shot
[2:31:12] <KaitlynnHere> Noice
[2:31:13] <%off_to_work_we_go> congrats! that was likely the first death of the new year in Japan
[2:31:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In the first stream.
[2:31:13] <%Garthunox> bullets are mini explosions
[2:31:15] <%st_jimmy456> shamRIP
[2:31:16] <%FboyDaKing> I KILLED YOU
[2:31:17] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you said there would be an explosion at the countdown
[2:31:17] <%PigGuy800> it's the hammer that fires the bullet right? not the slide?
[2:31:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> I guess
[2:31:18] <%HedgehogGames1> "He asked for it."
[2:31:19] <+Soliloquy123> The gunshot
[2:31:19] <SaltyAzteca> Oh shit, Pat hows it feel to be a genius
[2:31:21] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Honestly in an American court you could probably get off on self defense, dude absolutely had reason to fear for his life there
[2:31:21] <nmaten> hes gonna be alive in 2 games
[2:31:21] <%BoxNavy> that guys head exploded
[2:31:22] <cardamomo88> WHAT 2001 TIME TO BE ALIVE
[2:31:23] <+dante_must_die_exe> PENIS ATTACK i scountere with GUN
[2:31:24] <enfield001> He had a Nishikiyama moment
[2:31:24] <jorniev> HOW THE FUCK COULDNT HE TELL FROM GRABING THE GUN THAT IT WAS REAL
[2:31:26] <%ghostmcfly6> I mean at that point he kinda deserves it. Could have just walked away instead of being crazy and holding the gun.
[2:31:27] <Redahoge10> Nishikiyama but successful
[2:31:27] <%Niney_Who> You went to prison for HIM
[2:31:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NISHKI 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
[2:31:31] <+Wilabeen1997> Bullet instead of explosion, but yeah
[2:31:32] <%AzureGale> Fireworks
[2:31:34] <huskarl_zap> point blank rubber bullets Saejima never killed anyone
[2:31:35] <leinadtonu> I wonder if he's really dead...
[2:31:35] <%duckmeat_woohoo> HE TOOK THE FALL FOR THE WRONG GUY
[2:31:39] <dreamfillah> it's astonishing how this goofy game can pull of drama like that
[2:31:39] <%NovaKnightmare> Nishiki killed a man and Kiryu took the blame, Aoki killed a man and Ichiban took the blame.
[2:31:41] <%Blackleafx> @QueequegTheater Yeah but Japan REALLY doesnt like guns
[2:31:46] <+tigerfang86> GEORGE TAKEI WHY
[2:31:46] <%madmanrambler> weirdest part to me is Ichiban totally would have taken the fall for him
[2:31:47] <%bluescreen1988> stop complimenting pat your making him too strong!
[2:31:48] <skeletonknifefight> technically a very small small explosion
[2:31:48] <%baka_sugoi> damn feelbad
[2:31:50] <%EternalJedi> jorniev you can have a really authentic fake
[2:31:52] <primarch_lupercal> so many parallels with yakuza 1 @PatStaresAt
[2:31:55] <%condemned_15> Young Master is just Nishki
[2:31:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you're so good at predicting what will happen in a Yakuza game why did you fail the Yakuza certification quiz?
[2:31:57] <bobbyratlair> @enfield001 lul
[2:31:57] <%CalderGaming> Ichiban: "i still would have gone"
[2:31:58] <%Noogiez> then he switched clans like a bitch
[2:31:59] <%krispen_wa> SWALLOWED WHOLE
[2:31:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kappa
[2:32:02] <%QueequegTheater> COMMANDER SULU WHY
[2:32:02] <cardboardboots> ichi would of done it anyway
[2:32:06] <%AtlasMcCoy> he 100% would have still taken the fall
[2:32:08] <cardamomo88> BECAUSE HE WAS HIS DADDY
[2:32:08] <%Blackleafx> Yeah but they didnt wanna expose what really happened
[2:32:09] <$Skelemungus> to be fair he would of did it anyways
[2:32:10] <%Wallabri> he still would'a done it for you, man!!!
[2:32:11] <+Jaysky> I mean, he only lied for who he covered for
[2:32:11] <+pectusumbra> Yeah absolutely he would have done it
[2:32:11] <circular7> true he would have done it for you too
[2:32:13] <%medusasghost> isn't this better tho?
[2:32:13] <%Dunmarkh> He would have prefered it, fuck sawashiro
[2:32:17] <%trustycoyote> Yeah pretty sure he would have done it anyway
[2:32:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> just like all those beef bowls he swallowed
[2:32:17] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Arakawa, WTF!? Did you seriously think Ichiban wouldn't gladly do it anyway?
[2:32:19] <%duckmeat_woohoo> Wouldn't it be easier to take the fall for the son instead of Sawashiro who is an ass
[2:32:19] <%Maids4lyfe> Ichiban would have done it for him too
[2:32:20] <Redahoge10> Johnny George Takai why
[2:32:20] <olaksi> Kinda sucks he didn't trust him with the truth
[2:32:20] <+teh_rawk> EXTRA STEPS
[2:32:21] <Blank9> yeah, but the dad still lied about it too
[2:32:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> he would have still done it for sure
[2:32:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> He wants to turn him on his dead
[2:32:24] <+Jaysky> Ichi would totally go in for the young master
[2:32:24] <%BinaryFireball> ooooo this scene
[2:32:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> He'd have been way happier
[2:32:26] <%jillpilled> Ichi still would've done it, he's a good boi FeelsBadMan
[2:32:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> dad
[2:32:27] <GManx0> He would have done it faster
[2:32:29] <FusionFountain> Young master sugoiAwawa
[2:32:34] <%off_to_work_we_go> @queequegtheater depends on the state but yeah. if they could prove he spat on him first that's actually assault most places
[2:32:35] <jorniev> BUT WHY EVEN LIE TO KASUGA, DUDE WOULD HAVE TOTALLY DONE TIME ANYWAY
[2:32:36] <MasterTonberry23> daddy arakawa didnt want the other families to know his son was a quick shot
[2:32:39] <+Wilabeen1997> Yeah that’s what’s weird about that
[2:32:41] <ShichiNoBushi> But that was a fake assassination.
[2:32:41] <%honeyman18> No Regerts
[2:32:42] <circular7> dad did a lot of lying
[2:32:46] <+akscully> yakuza is a serious distant father syndrome story
[2:32:46] <%NopeBadguy> Yeah, but if Ichi went with him, this probably wouldn't have happened
[2:32:47] <%linSP> dad shot me because he LOVES me
[2:32:50] <cardamomo88> AHH ICHI MY BOY BibleThump BibleThump
[2:32:50] <Blank9> aoki has good reason to think his dad's a fucking scumbag for doing this to ichi too
[2:32:51] <%madmanrambler> yeah Ichi might have felt super ashamed about fucking up and leaving the young master alone to get in that situation, you could argue Arakawa did it to give Ichi something to be proud about in prison
[2:32:52] <akitanito> there are better things to say ichiban
[2:32:55] <artsupplies> ichiban's strength is in not letting anything get him down
[2:32:56] <jorniev> NO RAGRETS
[2:32:57] <+tigerfang86> CAUSE UH
[2:33:02] <%medusasghost> ugh that's depressing ichiban
[2:33:03] <%AtlasMcCoy> -2
[2:33:03] <%reonome> ICHIBAD???
[2:33:03] <%Blackleafx> ICHIBAD
[2:33:04] <skeletonknifefight> haha gotem
[2:33:06] <nmaten> ICHIBAD
[2:33:06] <BigMaximum> Ichiban's an idiot huh
[2:33:07] <+tigerfang86> YES
[2:33:09] <akitanito> rolled 1 on charisma check
[2:33:10] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[2:33:10] <+tigerfang86> YES HE HAS
[2:33:11] <SaltyAzteca> -2
[2:33:12] <%Wallabri> ichibad................

[2:33:33] <FusionFountain> Ichi-based
[2:33:35] <%duckmeat_woohoo> FULL METAL ALCHEMIST
[2:33:35] <PsychoPearl> Masato called him Ichibad in the beginning at the cabaret club
[2:33:36] <%EternalJedi> Ichibad is a callback to the young master making fun of him
[2:33:37] <enfield001> Yeah he has
[2:33:37] <+tigerfang86> man he hates Ichiban so much

[3:35:10] <%BinaryFireball> you need to grind
[3:35:11] <captain_demo779> "DO IT, FUCKER" says the game.
[3:35:11] <%R3Roundabout> Clear rewards are 1 time only, bonus rewards are given every cleay
[3:35:14] <GustauveVIII> THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL
[3:35:14] <%BoxNavy> monkaS

[3:35:16] <KingFatality> NO DON;T
[3:35:17] <%Jaromero435> NEED TO GRIND
[3:35:17] <%coreyyotto> basically yes
[3:35:17] <%QuipSan> yep
[3:35:17] <%psychicmaniac_> Grind through all floors. It’ll give weapons that are needed for the best weapons
[3:35:17] <%Garthunox> NO HE WONT

[3:35:20] <+talkingrain3139> Get to lvl 50
[3:35:20] <+Link232> Hell even if you do all 30 floors you prbably will get bodied anyways
[3:35:21] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt This is a 30 floor Bloody Palace with checkpoints after every 5 floors
[3:35:22] <iosephe> Shhhhhhh
[3:35:22] <%QueequegTheater> ONE GUY
[3:35:22] <Otatoptohami> geez
[3:35:23] <NicLoson> Gold moth here I guess?
[3:35:23] <%za7az> HELL HOUSE! HELL HOUSE! HELL HOUSE!
[3:35:24] <FistTheWizard> he could easily do the next part
[3:35:24] <%BinaryFireball> doo all 30 floors twice
[3:35:24] <Zbyrd0961> not wrong
[3:35:24] <rafflespaddock> really??
[3:35:25] <+Yossarian0> best place to level by miles
[3:35:25] <colzack_> Not really but it would make the next part easier
[3:35:26] <%cylish> .......I just got here, is that a super fighting robot?
[3:35:26] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt So the Omi Alliance HQ assumes like Level 50
[3:35:26] <%madmanrambler> nah go get bodied, its sick
[3:35:26] <artsupplies> grind time
[3:35:26] <+supersonic21> you will get fucking suplexed into dust if you try to do the omi hq
[3:35:27] <fIashman92> you need to be level like 50 to progress
[3:35:27] <%coreyyotto> It's about as optional as the business minigame
[3:35:28] <%Garthunox> I DID THE BOSS AT YOUR LEVEL
[3:35:29] <%Cozy90> YOULL BE FINE
[3:35:29] <championofsomeone> NO NO GET BODIED FIRST
[3:35:30] <huskarl_zap> i mean
[3:35:30] <%QueequegTheater> IT IS SUPER OPTIONAL
[3:35:31] <$Skelemungus> YAPPI
[3:35:31] <%murderof_crows> Continue the story! Do this later!
[3:35:31] <+tigerfang86> IT IS OPTIONAL BUT DO IT
[3:35:32] <+teh_rawk> its "optional"
[3:35:32] <Slim_Lipid> So much for all that grinding before hand LUL
[3:35:32] <%st_jimmy456> 2 guys
[3:35:35] <+Trash5DGod> good levels
[3:35:35] <%Solipsist_Construct> what those other people said, this is pretty important
[3:35:35] <+Wilabeen1997> You’ll probably be fine
[3:35:36] <%Bailey__gaming> 30 floors with checkpoints every 5 @patstaresat
[3:35:36] <%hahaha1171> do all
[3:35:36] <CelestialCage> LET HIM GET BODIED
[3:35:36] <%Freakin_Wolfy> It's OPTIONAL, but you HAVE to do it
[3:35:37] <Visorak6> You're overleveled as fuck anyway
[3:35:37] <huskarl_zap> hes already over leveled
[3:35:39] <TheHeroAppears> it's such a steep increase in difficulty it's nuts
[3:35:39] <+PR0swagonist> the game expects you to be strong
[3:35:39] <ssks123> There are some really good rewards for clearing hte last 5 floors
[3:35:40] <%QueequegTheater> NO IT DOESN'T
[3:35:40] <Maleicus> it is optional you just need to win the boss
[3:35:40] <Blank9> every 5 floors is a checkpoint you can continue from anytime
[3:35:41] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Get to LV %0
[3:35:41] <artsupplies> get to at least 45 imo
[3:35:41] <FistTheWizard> IT DOES NOT
[3:35:41] <devanmuse> THAT sounds like a lie
[3:35:41] <AwkwardSenpai> I got through chapter 12 without doing this. but I had to come back and do them for chapter 15
[3:35:41] <theotrainwreck> 2 GUYS
[3:35:42] <%Blackleafx> uhhhhh
[3:35:42] <Otatoptohami> no it most certainly does not
[3:35:42] <colzack_> Like you're a high enough level that youd be fine
[3:35:42] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited ?
[3:35:42] <%HedgehogGames1> @PatStaresAt The game expects you to be around level 50 for the next story section.
[3:35:43] <%SvenHolgersson> DO IT THOUGH
[3:35:43] <TheHardM> Omi HQ has something called a "Wall".
[3:35:43] <%yeknomlive> i did it at like 40
[3:35:44] <%Garthunox> NO IT DOESNT
[3:35:44] <%TheNewJapanGuy> %0
[3:35:44] <%madmanrambler> GET BODIED FIRST PLEASE ITS SO SICK WHEN IT HAPPENS

[3:35:44] <%dorthafiq> DON'T TELL HIM GUYS
[3:35:44] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS SUPER OPTIONAL
[3:35:44] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt LIES
[3:35:45] <KingVantq> @patstaresat the big upgrade mats are here
[3:35:45] <%AzureGale> There's the level spike

[3:35:50] <RazYamiyo> NO NO ITS FINE
[3:35:51] <MystyTristy> NO IT DOESNT
[3:35:51] <%Garthunox> NO IT DOESNT#
[3:35:51] <theotrainwreck> THEY JUST BAD
[3:35:52] <%SunnyVarietyPack> 50 is kind low if I’m honest
[3:35:52] <%SvenHolgersson> DO ITTTTTTTTTTT
[3:35:52] <$Skelemungus> big spike
[3:35:52] <%psychicmaniac_> Stack up on Staminans
[3:35:53] <%StaceMcGate> you are in fact under leveled
[3:35:53] <%BinaryFireball> this is where I stopped playing
[3:35:53] <%admiral_qq> THAT PERSON IS SUPER WRONG
[3:35:53] <+ALazo> Aren't you level 40 anyway?
[3:35:53] <%MugenSandan> @patstaresat the design of this robot just convinces me that Binary Domain is in the same universe
[3:35:53] <+chiazam> Isn't Pat already grinded to shit?
[3:35:53] <+Trash5DGod> It optional to skip, but skipping wouldn't be OPTIMAL
[3:35:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> BULLLLLSHIT
[3:35:54] <ghostkingwho> NOT IT DOESN'T FUCK OFF
[3:35:55] <%Cozy90> 45 IS FINE
[3:35:55] <KingFatality> GO TRY IT]
[3:35:56] <Remedy020> Difficulty spike monkaS
[3:35:56] <%chexmixisbest> no it doesnt what
[3:35:57] <SomeAsianDood> 40 is tough 45 is fine
[3:35:57] <%Dova573> 2 GUS
[3:35:58] <Scorchfield> i dare you to go ahead and skip the arena, see how far you get
[3:35:58] <toxicgad> Go there anyway
[3:35:58] <%Monkeyweed21> THAT IS SUPER WRONG
[3:35:58] <cardamomo88> GET 50
[3:35:59] <%Garthunox> one guy!!!!
[3:35:59] <%Nekros4442> you are not overleveled
[3:35:59] <%owazowski> DO ALL OF IT OR DON'T EITHER WAY I'M LOVIN IT
[3:35:59] <%jillpilled> That sounds like a lie
[3:35:59] <%KineKithZen> You are not overlevelled but you don't need to be 50
[3:36:00] <toxicgad> coward
[3:36:01] <+Javaa01> You can totally do it at 45
[3:36:01] <%Garthunox> ONE GUY
[3:36:02] <%coreyyotto> Also you get a bunch of good gear and materials as rewards on each floor
[3:36:02] <ProfessorLuigi> BRUH
[3:36:04] <%Dova573> 45 its fine
[3:36:05] <Visorak6> I've seen people do it at 40 easily
[3:36:06] <%BoxNavy> you are being pranked apparently
[3:36:06] <+Yossarian0> weapon/armor means more than level tho, you can take people stronger than you by 5 levels easy
[3:36:07] <Sain_127> im so hungry
[3:36:07] <FistTheWizard> you're completely fine
[3:36:08] <%tawdymcstoic> 45 is recommended
[3:36:08] <%dashmatt> WRONG
[3:36:09] <GustauveVIII> DO YOU WANT HARD TIME? THEN SKIP BATTLE ARENA
[3:36:10] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Get to LV 50 before Omi HQ
[3:36:10] <%Cozy90> PAT 45
[3:36:11] <FistTheWizard> I did it at your level
[3:36:13] <%QueequegTheater> Thanks two guys for tanking the rest of the stream
[3:36:13] <mortificent> Big lies, 45 is super fine
[3:36:13] <+Javaa01> 50 is overleved for this on Medium
[3:36:14] <Blank9> being overleveled in this game is being 3 levels over, because then you can't get higher anyway
[3:36:14] <+robert_edwards> I did it at 40 too
[3:36:14] <livi242> it's not that bad if you know how to play the game lol
[3:36:14] <%Garthunox> PAT THEY ARE WRONG YOU ARE AT A PERFECTLY FINE LEVEL
[3:36:15] <%st_jimmy456> psa2guy
[3:36:15] <Mr_Strut> MMM
[3:36:18] <Otatoptohami> lame
[3:36:19] <%WhereIsWill> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[3:36:20] <fuji_92> nah he's telling the truth chat, SHIT GETS REAL
[3:36:20] <%Dova573> You can
[3:36:20] <randomahole> accurate to Dragon quest
[3:36:21] <+Trash5DGod> it'd be super cool
[3:36:21] <lumenglow> I literally beat the omi part at level 38 youre FINE
[3:36:21] <Sain_127> go for it
[3:36:21] <AwkwardSenpai> You absolutely do not "have" to do it. it just makes the boss the more challenging.
[3:36:21] <%Mitsu500> You're fine as is
[3:36:21] <Remedy020> rooKek
[3:36:22] <thebalticguy1> at least 45
[3:36:22] <californaya> do it offstream please
[3:36:23] <+conradical> the arena isn't that difficult anyway tho
[3:36:23] <+BloodyBurney> only an hour, tops
[3:36:23] <+supersonic21> you will get your dick suplexed
[3:36:24] <huskarl_zap> whats coming up is more like trail and error but it still sucks
[3:36:24] <%NopeBadguy> You'd have al ot of really good upgrade mats
[3:36:25] <%coreyyotto> safety save
[3:36:25] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Save before and give it a shot
[3:36:25] <%StaceMcGate> YOU ARE WRONG GARTH
[3:36:26] <%krispen_wa> ON-SCREEN GRIND
[3:36:27] <%AzureGale> What if pat BIG CHEATED
[3:36:27] <andritt> 45 is good
[3:36:27] <xbb1024> then it will take the rest of your stream
[3:36:28] <%BinaryFireball> You might want to do some of it for stream but I wouldnt suggest doing it all
[3:36:29] <+Link232> You can do it pretty easily, buy a bunch of Tauriner and just orbital cannon/heal between each fight
[3:36:29] <%TheNewJapanGuy> No he isn't
[3:36:30] <+Wilabeen1997> You actually might be gine with how you’ve grinder other classes but I’m not sure
[3:36:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> FUCKING DEW IT
[3:36:30] <Maleicus> you sure can give it a shot
[3:36:30] <%StaceMcGate> AT LEAST LVL 45
[3:36:31] <%MikeTD81> you are under leveled
[3:36:32] <RaidenRising> BIG NUMBER PAT , B EE G NUMBER
[3:36:32] <%Kaca920> Save and try both ways
[3:36:35] <$StrawberryPantsu> It's fairly Easy with Orbital Laser
[3:36:36] <olaksi> 45
[3:36:36] <@SoFarFetched> Pat should be overleveled to get to Cyberpunk on time Kappa
[3:36:37] <+supersonic21> lmao dont do it off stream this is actualy fun
[3:36:37] <tattleworm> i was honestly expecting a "here's a save i prepared earlier where i've already done it"
[3:36:37] <Dr00_PhD> It took me until this part of the game to realize you could switch out party members in battle
[3:36:38] <KingVantq> try it pre grind
[3:36:38] <%Mitsu500> You're fine
[3:36:39] <hassanico2> This robot is horrible
[3:36:39] <Ner234> Ah the duality of chat
[3:36:41] <%PigGuy800> welcome to the wall!
[3:36:41] <cardamomo88> LV 50 WILL BE THE BEST
[3:36:41] <%BoxNavy> oh god does it say yappi everytime you talk to it
[3:36:43] <colzack_> Not here
[3:36:43] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> We all know you're going to do it. The only question is how much on stream will you do.
[3:36:44] <$Skelemungus> but the hype shit is coming up BibleThump
[3:36:44] <%Garthunox> @StaceMcGate YOU'VE BEEN WRONG BEFORE
[3:36:45] <+loukemia83> Romance workshop
[3:36:45] <Blank9> you can't save inside of it, but you can leave and continue every 5
[3:36:45] <%BinaryFireball> no you have to go back to romance
[3:36:45] <huskarl_zap> you have to go all the way with no breaks
[3:36:47] <FistTheWizard> you dont upgrade them here
[3:36:49] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Another guy I watched play this Grinded here until like 46 and still struggled at Omi HQ. It isn't optional in my opinion
[3:36:49] <+conradical> you have to go back to Romance Workshop
[3:36:49] <KingFatality> ROMANCE WORKSHOP
[3:36:50] <%coreyyotto> you get the materials, then you have to go back to sumire
[3:36:50] <mortificent> LEVEL 45 IS REALLY GOOD
[3:36:50] <willsin4fun> place is definitely optional but great for grinding; & 45 is good
[3:36:50] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> he gives the itens
[3:36:52] <Maleicus> back at the workshop
[3:36:52] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt you can go back to Ichinjo via taxi at any time
[3:36:53] <%SunnyVarietyPack> No just drive back to romance workshop
[3:36:53] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You get the materials by clearing conditions in every fight.
[3:36:55] <+supersonic21> this whole thing can be done in an hour no problem
[3:36:55] <NitronStreams> Okay but why is there a fucking robot Actually?
[3:36:55] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat checkpoint every 5 floors

[3:38:37] <%chexmixisbest> poundmates are your friend with the extra objectives
[3:38:39] <%AlphaRayAllen> LASER
[3:38:40] <+starpunchghost> Dragon engine the best LUL
[3:38:42] <%Mr_Pylon> vampirism is good on these guys
[3:38:43] <deadpak_> Also tag team and prolly peppermill
[3:38:48] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt You're expected to dump MP here, the Poppo at the end of the street down from here sells tons of really good mana replenish items, and you can safely refill at the start of each floor
[3:38:49] <%PigGuy800> does sujidex say their weakness
[3:38:52] <%honeyman18> also water if I remember
[3:38:55] <cheerthisdan> I hope they never fix the Dragon Engine physics
[3:39:02] <%NopeBadguy> You get a lot of XP from these fights, so don't be afraid to spend resources to meet the turn limits. @PatStaresAt
[3:39:02] <Blank9> oh yeah, poundmates does help a ton
[3:39:04] <%Dragon4234> OPPA DRAGON STYLE
[3:39:07] <%krispen_wa> so did he swap out Eri for Zhao permanently?
[3:39:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> Doesn't Ichiban have a stab move from Bodyguard?
[3:39:15] <+starpunchghost> @cheerthisdan Agreed
[3:39:15] <fIashman92> You can tag in your part memebers, who hopefully have insta death
[3:39:17] <TheHeroAppears> also you level up a lot from this
[3:39:23] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Also you might level up almost every fight
[3:39:24] <KingFatality> checkpoints every like 5 levels
[3:39:25] <%weissguard> You can also adjust equipment and heal up inbetween rounds.
[3:39:25] <+tigerfang86> HUGE REWARDS
[3:39:27] <%Alazull> Also that like fried food shop sells XP up meals
[3:39:27] <%chexmixisbest> oh yeah spam abilities
[3:39:30] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat also checkpoint every 5 floors help
[3:39:31] <%Mr_Pylon> Also lots of levels
[3:39:32] <%penitentpendant> The Grind!
[3:39:32] <%QuipSan> you level like crazy here
[3:39:34] <%SvenHolgersson> You can earn millions here
[3:39:34] <californaya> that's some big exp, damn
[3:39:35] <+teh_rawk> THE GRIND DIMENSION
[3:39:36] <%madmanrambler> you'll also be leveling up like every other fight here
[3:39:37] <shadespiral> It'd be funny if the voice director for the Eng cast in this was also the voice director for Dragon Quest 11's Eng cast.
[3:39:38] <Zarkith> Each party member's move counts as ONE TURN
[3:39:39] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Ten turns as in ten moves
[3:39:39] <+tigerfang86> open the treasure chest
[3:39:40] <%madmanrambler> so plenty of recovering
[3:39:40] <%AlphaRayAllen> lol no
[3:39:40] <xbb1024> keep going down
[3:39:40] <Visorak6> 10 turns not rounds
[3:39:41] <colzack_> Yeah you'll get to past lvl 40 in no time
[3:39:41] <%Mr_Pylon> NO turns are character turns
[3:39:42] <hollydayskz> 10 turns is like 10 actions rather
[3:39:42] <%Alazull> 10 Individual turns
[3:39:42] <hassanico2> What? That was way more
[3:39:43] <%coreyyotto> The turn counting is kinda unclear
[3:39:43] <%krispen_wa> HUUUGE EXP
[3:39:44] <$StrawberryPantsu> TURNS
[3:39:44] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt a turn is a player action
[3:39:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> Each party member counts as 1 turn
[3:39:45] <+PR0swagonist> each move is a turn
[3:39:45] <KCFusecoast> Is Pat playing this on PS5?
[3:39:45] <%Jaromero435> INDIVIDUAL TURNS
[3:39:46] <olaksi> 1 party member moving is 1 turn
[3:39:46] <%madmanrambler> yeah ten turns counting each person's action
[3:39:46] <+Javaa01> Each character attack is one turn
[3:39:46] <TheHeroAppears> use the lazer
[3:39:46] <deadpak_> U get health restore from LEVEL UP and RANK UP
[3:39:46] <$StrawberryPantsu> NOT ROUNDS
[3:39:47] <%SvenHolgersson> That was like 12
[3:39:48] <%Garthunox> each character is 1 turn
[3:39:49] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> You also get checkpoints every 5 floors to just go eat
[3:39:49] <$Skelemungus> their turns count too
[3:39:51] <+tigerfang86> DO IT AGAIN
[3:39:51] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:39:52] <%KineKithZen> Hope you had fun levelling up all those jobs
[3:39:53] <+Javaa01> As I said, MP dump
[3:39:54] <+teh_rawk> dont worry about it pat
[3:39:55] <Mr_Strut> 1 billion yen
[3:39:56] <Blank9> you can warp to each 5th floor to retry or retreat
[3:39:57] <%SvenHolgersson> Yea it fucked me over too
[3:39:57] <NeroInfinite> Haha
[3:39:58] <%QuipSan> dump mp
[3:39:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> does that include enemy turns?
[3:40:00] <%Jekado> yeah why you got go HARD on these for the max grind
[3:40:00] <+conradical> just dump your big attacks
[3:40:01] <+loukemia83> BIG AOE TIME
[3:40:01] <thebalticguy1> wrong way
[3:40:01] <%Lunaticbro > you also gets huge levels, so mp gets free restored so it's a non issue mostly
[3:40:01] <%SvenHolgersson> No worries
[3:40:02] <%AlphaRayAllen> LUL
[3:40:03] <%Mantorok06> @patstaresat Spam the laser
[3:40:05] <FistTheWizard> I mean
[3:40:07] <%BoxNavy> poppo
[3:40:07] <+BloodyBurney> ergo, do big aoe over and over
[3:40:08] <NitronStreams> Mission Failed successfully
[3:40:08] <ssks123> time to buy tons of alcohol
[3:40:09] <%madmanrambler> @OneThousandTomatoes yep
[3:40:10] <%Jekado> PUPPO!?!
[3:40:19] <Maleicus> dont worry you can redo them as much as you like
[3:40:19] <$Skelemungus> yay
[3:40:20] <gungniir_> Drugstore
[3:40:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> NO DO NOT SPAM LASER
[3:40:21] <%Monkeyweed21> you're full @PatStaresAt
[3:40:21] <+sillyschlub> get the drugs
[3:40:21] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[3:40:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Never not laser
[3:40:23] <+Link232> Buy a bunch of MP stuff, laser at the start and then just recover between each round
[3:40:23] <FistTheWizard> you can go up at any point and travel back down every 5 floors
[3:40:24] <%QuipSan> Aoe attacks really help
[3:40:24] <deadpak_> Fuck tha POPPO
[3:40:25] <hollydayskz> Yeah the free levels will restore your HP and MP
[3:40:25] <%Garthunox> dont spam the laser
[3:40:26] <Blank9> there's Silver and Gold safes around town too
[3:40:26] <%SvenHolgersson> Laser good
[3:40:26] <gungniir_> You can buy Royales
[3:40:27] <%honeyman18> Booze it up in Osaka, the true way
[3:40:29] <KCFusecoast> Is Pat playing this on PS5? @PatStaresAt
[3:40:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> Laser is way too much MP for the damage
[3:40:29] <%coreyyotto> Buying a shit ton of booze and tauriners and spamming the lazer is a legitimate strategy
[3:40:30] <%Jekado> there is also the drug store north
[3:40:31] <+Yossarian0> if you wanna learn classes, the first fight is about 10-11 job levels. Will get you the first carry over skill
[3:40:31] <$Skelemungus> hes not wrong
[3:40:32] <%Mr_Pylon> Laser, alcohol, tumeric are your friends and Ice
[3:40:34] <%otakusquarefan> Joon-gis divine shot is really good here
[3:40:34] <+conradical> btw you get full refills every level up and job level up so you can spam your heavy hitting skills nearly every round
[3:40:39] <%Freakin_Wolfy> PUT MONEY IN THE ATM
[3:40:40] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt I don't know if you saw it, but your physical attacks become the element of the weapon you're holding. For Ichiban, that's Elec. Just hope that helps with some weakness confusion.
[3:40:42] <%Alazull> The fried food shop across the bridge sells XP up meal combos for cheap @PatStaresAt
[3:40:43] <mortificent> ALSO, OMI HQ ASSUMES LVL 45, NOT 50
[3:40:45] <Saltmeisterr> Oh this is the place kiryu fucking destroys
[3:40:45] <GustauveVIII> get eri in there and just straight up damage and use items in place of a healer
[3:40:46] <%Rikufmix21> lazer will litterally just win
[3:40:51] <SomeAsianDood> I see they fixed the microwave after kiryu shoved 6 people into it
[3:40:57] <%coreyyotto> The lazer is an AoE that doesn't miss, it's worth it at this point
[3:41:04] <@SoFarFetched> get more overlevelled
[3:41:04] <%Garthunox> @Freakin_Wolfy why? he can just get more
[3:41:05] <+Javaa01> You will be chugging a LOT of Kakubin here
[3:41:06] <FistTheWizard> that is an outright lie though
[3:41:07] <californaya> what's important is you have FUN
[3:41:08] <%Broken_Sonex> But what if i need them later? THIS is later
[3:41:09] <%NopeBadguy> Okay, sorry, just saw you confused earlier.
[3:41:10] <jazzcuzzi> @PatStaresAt Joon-gi just learned a skill that'll help you lots in the arena
[3:41:11] <%BoxNavy> this sick grinding content
[3:41:12] <$Skelemungus> 50 if you want to be safe
[3:41:13] <FistTheWizard> you can easily do it at like 35

[3:41:18] <%baka_sugoi> yeah enjoy pats suffering
[3:41:19] <%Alazull> Also @PatStaresAt Every five floors is a checkpoint
[3:41:19] <fuji_92> Pat will get there at 60 so relax folks
[3:41:22] <mortificent> oh yeah, for sure, I had a lot of fun here
[3:41:23] <%weissguard> Become, GIANT
[3:41:24] <%Grimlockfly> laser, chef, laser chef
[3:41:28] <%Freakin_Wolfy> @Garthunox the way I approached this was to just keep fighting until I die
[3:41:29] <Otatoptohami> just because people suck and had to grind up to 50 or whatever doesnt mean its required
[3:41:30] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Might want to eat at restaurant, get EXP boost and repeat last few floors and EXP and Loot
[3:41:30] <Zarkith> I did Omi HQ at level 45 and it was FUCKING TOUGH. 50 is the safe bet
[3:41:31] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's doable at 35, it's just easy at 45
[3:41:33] <%madmanrambler> oh did joon hit 18? okay he's now super busted
[3:41:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> @coreyyotto doesn't nanba's big aoe also never miss?
[3:41:36] <%Freakin_Wolfy> @Garthunox don't need to grind more if you already have it
[3:41:36] <%za7az> I'm enjoying the content
[3:41:37] <xenofphobia> omi at level 45ish was legit fun and difficult for me
[3:41:39] <%BoxNavy> yeeeeeeee
[3:41:39] <cheerthisdan> ORBITAL LASER SHORTCUT
[3:41:43] <colzack_> Honestly you can beat it even if you're 15 levels underleveled but it's just a really tough fight
[3:41:48] <KingVantq> Pat is gonna be like lvl 70 tomorrow I can see it
[3:41:49] <%krispen_wa> NUKE SPEEDRUN
[3:41:52] <$Skelemungus> slap their shits
[3:41:53] <%QuipSan> giga swing is your friend
[3:41:53] <%madmanrambler> I was at 48 personally and had a good time
[3:41:55] <%darkheroxiii> divine shot is AOE
[3:42:00] <%Garthunox> @Freakin_Wolfy you missed pat cheating money into the game yeah?
[3:42:05] <trasherxl> I personally enjoy engaging with content and being influenced
[3:42:07] <Baeltyr> HAH a pier reviewer lol
[3:42:08] <thebalticguy1> DIVINE SHOT PAT
[3:42:11] <+Double_Tap_That> @PatStaresAt Give the story mission a shot. The "wall" isn't that far from the start of the mission, so you won't lose too much time if you give it a try.
[3:42:14] <NeroInfinite> OKAYU AT ARMS
[3:42:16] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt i think there's a convenience store on the west side of Sotenbori that sells liquor and shit, get some tumeric tablets, laser for days
[3:42:18] <+GalacticaPhanto> Also Nanba is super useful here
[3:42:22] <redrins> you'll level up a ton in this, so don't worry too much bout mp
[3:42:23] <ShichiNoBushi> Aside from this just being Yakuza, why is there suddenly a robot?
[3:42:24] <%madmanrambler> yeah try out divine shot, that thing is a busted aoe that cares a lot less about positioning
[3:42:25] <%Dragon4234> OPPA Dragon Style
[3:42:30] <%otakusquarefan> Pat use divine shot
[3:42:30] <%Alazull> No lie once you get to the bottom, it's just get three XP up meals, run in, laser and then clean up for five floors for awesome xp
[3:42:30] <redrins> just make sure to look at your exp bar
[3:42:37] <%coreyyotto> @OneThousandTomatoes All of the Essence skills don't miss, but it's less common for enemies to be resistant to lightning. That said, the Pyro Prison and Bird Essence skills are pretty good too.
[3:42:51] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @ShichiNoBushi Because those are actually a real thing in Japan now.

[3:56:58] <redrins> you get the dragon bat from this btw
[3:56:59] <%madmanrambler> it's actually not that bad compared to the helmet considering it boosts attack
[3:56:59] <NitronStreams> YAY TRASH
[3:57:01] <%psychicmaniac_> @beepbeepbopbop he also has an AOE essence, but you don’t really use that one for AOE since it’s stronger when used on a single enemy LUL
[3:57:02] <marvel877> but the defense go down
[3:57:03] <%Monkeyweed21> ATTACK GO UP

[3:57:35] <redrins> you can leave whenever honestly
[3:57:36] <huskarl_zap> All the way

[4:22:09] <%Joe2187> Dont grind these guys
[4:22:13] <%Joe2187> its not worth it
[4:22:15] <seaechiowai> psaGoblin
[4:22:23] <+fetrigon> just let zangief fall on his head. It builds character. Kappa
[4:22:27] <%Joe2187> Chapter 12 is the grind dungeon
[4:22:34] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh boy, hes really keeping Nanba from melting these fights
[4:22:34] <%krispen_wa> Cheat break
[4:22:38] <%StaceMcGate> this is the best and fastest way to grind in game
[4:22:47] <%televisedrevolting> Is Pat peeing again? I left for like a minute.
[4:22:50] <%StaceMcGate> metal slimes in chapter 15 are not as efficient
[4:22:59] <akitanito> dog is peeing
[4:22:59] <TheHeroAppears> just keep telling him the next chapter is where he should grind :^) even when he hits 15
[4:23:14] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Well this and Kamo underground
[4:23:31] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I mean you're right doesn't really need to grind until he beats the game
[4:23:32] <%Joe2187> You can farm the hobos ins 15 in minutes for 30 job levels in less than 10 mins
[4:23:34] <%RealThiele> Ch 16 is the real grind spot
[4:23:47] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the 26 or 28 floor are the best place to grind
[4:24:01] <%krispen_wa> Maybe we were the grind spot
[4:24:05] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you get like 100k in 2 min
[4:24:20] <seaechiowai> @krispen_wa this
[4:24:21] <KingVantq> Pat is gonna have all jobs at 30 by next stream
[4:24:25] <%Joe2187> I tried approaching the True Final Millenium tower at level 80 and got wiped in one shot
[4:24:46] <breakerdsx> Maybe it were the grind spots we met along the way?
[4:24:46] <%Joe2187> on the first fight
[4:25:22] <+Javaa01> Yeah you need to be maxed out to try True Final Millennium Tower
[4:25:36] <%Joe2187> The final final dungeon requires all Jobs and all Levels max for every character
[4:25:45] <%StaceMcGate> fuck true final, just extends gameplay for another 15-20 hours
[4:25:50] <seaechiowai> eyy max is on

[4:35:38] <%charp35> Why is the pepper so strong
[4:35:40] <+taltalheights> Spiced
[4:35:41] <+tigerfang86> It is
[4:35:41] <%Mr_Pylon> I really need to download this ost
[4:35:42] <+Link232> This game has weird move balancing
[4:35:45] <%beepbeepbopbop> Totally
[4:35:45] <colzack_> Which one
[4:35:46] <+abrupt_abe> Scaling seems. broken
[4:35:46] <+tigerfang86> but that's just the power of Pepper pat
[4:35:47] <+PR0swagonist> peppermill is actually op
[4:35:47] <%penitentpendant> Really powerful pepper?
[4:35:48] <+MrMcCrabby> oh god not hte pepper
[4:35:49] <+Javaa01> Yes
[4:35:49] <%Garthunox> Just like Mabuch, even his fake is weak to Pepper
[4:35:49] <%coreyyotto> it ignores defense or something
[4:35:50] <%tawdymcstoic> NOW THE REAL BANGER COMES IN
[4:35:50] <%AtlasMcCoy> Well how would YOU feel if you got peppered in your face?
[4:35:51] <fIashman92> Darts, peppermill blow, and the starting ice move are oddly strong
[4:35:51] <%Jekado> Thought that was pepper but i guess he got A-SALT-ed!!!
[4:35:51] <%NovaKnightmare> pepper HURTS
[4:35:51] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt That move has like high base damage on its first and last moves, it's weird
[4:35:52] <+tigerfang86> Yeah
[4:35:52] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Have you ever had pepper thrown at your face?
[4:35:53] <digaogrunge> pepper hurts tummy
[4:35:53] <+loukemia83> yes
[4:35:54] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Some moves are just busted
[4:35:54] <ssks123> ye
[4:35:54] <Zbyrd0961> yup
[4:35:55] <GandhiTheTerrible> ye
[4:35:55] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> ye
[4:35:56] <%televisedrevolting> Yes
[4:35:57] <%Dova573> yeah
[4:35:57] <colzack_> you have to beat 21 I think
[4:35:58] <%Jaromero435> yea
[4:35:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @after you beat 21
[4:35:59] <KingFatality> yup
[4:36:00] <Ultimatefool> Yes
[4:36:01] <Blank9> yes
[4:36:02] <+teg88> You try taking a pepper shaker to the head
[4:36:02] <%Dragon4234> Peppermill is like the best single target
[4:36:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> Because damage scaling in this game is FUCKED and some medium/heavy skills are better than Extreme skills
[4:36:04] <ShawnEXE> yes
[4:36:05] <%HedgehogGames1> Yep, checkpoint.
[4:36:05] <%charp35> talk to the bot first
[4:36:06] <+Gespens> I think Chef in general has a lot of strong moves. It hsa a move that does like, 50% more damage against bleeding foes for cut damage
[4:36:07] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt The first hit almost always knocks down too, so they can't block the ones after
[4:36:08] <NitronStreams> LUL
[4:36:09] <%coreyyotto> like the second part where you hit them on the ground for sure gets the knock down attack bonus
[4:36:16] <%boomstickery> the pepper is nanomachines
[4:36:18] <Blank9> you can start at any multiple of 5
[4:36:18] <%WhereIsWill> lets see how you react to getting pepper poured on you. it burns! LUL
[4:36:19] <+senfood> oh god no
[4:36:26] <+tigerfang86> no

[4:38:48] <%Jekado> your gonna run out of money each weapon is about 50mil total
[4:38:50] <Blank9> it's sold at le merche in kamurocho
[4:38:52] <%Dunmarkh> Just make eri a night queen instead
[4:38:53] <ketchuo13> Green Dragon Pogchamp
[4:38:53] <+zaturnity> The weapon upgrades get so expensive
[4:38:54] <Blank9> all the upgrade weapons are
[4:39:00] <%SunnyVarietyPack> I feel like it’s somewhere else, but I don’t remember
[4:39:01] <redrins> it does
[4:39:03] <%KineKithZen> Executive Hero isn't so bad
[4:39:04] <+BloodyBurney> they put some fucking grinds in this game man
[4:39:07] <FistTheWizard> correct
[4:39:08] <%Garthunox> Yup
[4:39:12] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Yeah you can't buy it yet
[4:39:12] <%coreyyotto> yeah i'm sitting on like 3 ceramic boxcutters, they're out there
[4:39:23] <Blank9> nope, it sells 10 million cost upgrade weapons for every class
[4:39:23] <%king_wragles> Has anyone told Pat with his gear and levels he's able to just cake walk the rest of the game?
[4:39:25] <%zaturnity> Yeah, that’s right
[4:39:26] <randomahole> time to cheat in more money and materials
[4:39:27] <%KineKithZen> That sounds uncomfortable
[4:39:29] <fIashman92> Probably random silver safees
[4:39:38] <Zarkith> Inject the ceramic boxcutters directly into Pat's veins
[4:39:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> I bought the enforcer shield from Le Marche without earning it from Shogi
[4:39:56] <FistTheWizard> aw
[4:39:56] <SchroedingersFerret> borglar
[4:39:59] <%Garthunox> Did pat get the gold chest in the room above this restuarant?
[4:40:04] <hassanico2> Eri could solo the game I bet
[4:40:06] <ketchuo13> Yeah, that was my party too
[4:40:07] <%AzureGale> Booooo
[4:40:08] <FistTheWizard> goodbye business lady
[4:40:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> But Eri is so good though
[4:40:09] <%StebTheVee> Back to the business dimension
[4:40:14] <pi_in_the_sci> That's a bad final party for the boss\
[4:40:15] <SirDogBear> thats a solid party PogChamp
[4:40:17] <huskarl_zap> borgor
[4:40:17] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> but eri is a fucking monster tho
[4:40:18] <%HedgehogGames1> That is the correct party
[4:40:19] <+loukemia83> Namba's a better healer than Saeko because of his AoE magic
[4:40:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Are you gonna show off Nanba's Meteor move @PatStaresAt ?
[4:40:22] <%zaturnity> Yay
[4:40:23] <%coreyyotto> Legit I think i've gotten one from a gold safe. Besides that I did the part-time hero piecemeal during the story, and a lot of them you can just buy the items needed for the requests.
[4:40:24] <KingVantq> Goodbye handler
[4:40:24] <hassanico2> I hate this robot
[4:40:26] <%penitentpendant> Really good idea to save
[4:40:27] <sponsoredviewer910> same as everyone
[4:40:31] <Blank9> you can swap off anyway
[4:40:38] <fIashman92> It's Binary Domain 2
[4:40:40] <colzack_> Safe to say there wont be anymore story progression this stream?

[4:40:52] <Pakooboomi> are the dlc classes any good? thinking of getting it
[4:41:01] <+Javaa01> The good thing is that if you die in this arena, you don't get a game over, you just get dumped outside
[4:41:04] <FistTheWizard> aw yeah the good music
[4:41:05] <%Dunmarkh> @Pakooboomi very

[4:49:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> I mean this is a construction site
[4:49:48] <%reonome> at least the monkey isn't in it this time
[4:49:57] <%coreyyotto> @gnarly_memes_bro Nanba fits the role much earlier since he always has a fire skill. For the others, you'd have to level Foreman
[4:50:01] <CelestialCage> Yeah it's manned by some guy now
[4:50:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> it anything this being here makes more sense than any other
[4:50:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @huskarl_zap hydrolics are acting up
[4:50:07] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @pksilent01 first floor is mid 30s last floor is 60

[4:50:23] <NitronStreams> Like... this ISNT in Ichi's head thats an ACTUAL Excavator
[4:50:25] <%coreyyotto> it has a really obvious weakness though
[4:50:25] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @coreyyotto so like I said, every male character if you're smart
[4:50:29] <%penitentpendant> Or Ichi needs to SUPER CLUTCH
[4:50:39] <SirDogBear> it doesn't matter the bonus prize is just a cough tin plenty of ways to get those
[4:50:44] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Just repeat the tower off stream, you'll crush it the second time
[4:50:47] <%Grimlockfly> Laser
[4:50:47] <+LandOfTheWay> damn, almost had it
[4:50:47] <%KineKithZen> Yeah having multiple people with Fortune Teller levelled is your best bet
[4:50:49] <%slrls_> if only nanba were here
[4:50:59] <skyentombment> WHAT
[4:50:59] <fuji_92> nanba has a move for the digger
[4:51:00] <CelestialCage> A tazer being effectiveon this is hilarious
[4:51:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> why not just...attack the guy inside? because gamer brain?
[4:51:08] <FistTheWizard> punch digger
[4:51:09] <fuji_92> the forecast one
[4:51:11] <%coreyyotto> the cough drop tin is an important upgrade material, for some reason
[4:51:11] <skyentombment> WHY DID ERI PULL OUT A MACHINE GUN
[4:51:13] <CelestialCage> Oh yeah we gave Nanba the best electric move?
[4:51:16] <+loukemia83> just punch it, thats how it works
[4:51:17] <redrins> you NEED to be drunk
[4:51:20] <%gnarly_memes_bro> yeah once I got everyone fulminating forecast the game became a fucking joke
[4:51:24] <%tawdymcstoic> ?
[4:51:25] <+dante_must_die_exe> POWER: ???
[4:51:30] <%Hotironclad> ???%
[4:51:30] <%Niney_Who> the more drunk he is, the more that move does
[4:51:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> because girls get guns
[4:51:35] <+CherteuseKapibara> Useless if not wasted
[4:51:40] <fuji_92> get drunk
[4:51:44] <PkSilent01> Pit of the 100 trials
[4:51:46] <redrins> the power goes up with drunken-ness
[4:51:52] <%ghostofsolomon> HI @PatStaresAt GOOD MORNING FROM SINGAPORE!
[4:51:55] <seaechiowai> more alcohol = more damage
[4:51:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh god this guy
[4:52:00] <%reonome> is that heihachi
[4:52:01] <%doctordunno> electric whip is a new level of CBT

[4:52:47] <TheHeroAppears> pat has a problem
[4:52:56] <vanillain> i've heard so many people say they're overleveled at this point of the story
[4:53:06] <%gnarly_memes_bro> the final stretch of bosses is kind of stupid in how little your level and stats affects the actual fights
[4:53:09] <%admiral_qq> being over 50 trivializes the game at this point
[4:53:11] <+BloodyBurney> also the gear aint half bad, by which i mean its some of the best you can get
[4:53:11] <+loukemia83> Actually not over leveled yet, lol
[4:53:18] <%R3Roundabout> He just wants the floor 30 reward
[4:53:24] <%StaceMcGate> Job Levels >>>>> Character Levels
[4:53:25] <%Daniel_Is_I> I was like level 55 when I finished this chapter

[5:06:33] <%king_wragles> You mean, Omi @sporeian94
[5:06:35] <%king_wragles> ?
[5:06:36] <%beepbeepbopbop> I reckon being overleveled at Omi really sours the experience
[5:06:42] <%coreyyotto> I do recommend switching Nanba back to hobo
[5:06:43] <sponsoredviewer910> repeat the arena for more dragon gear
[5:06:44] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you can buy the minister robes on the pawn shop in sotenbori
[5:06:52] <%king_wragles> Cause I'm not 100% sure whether or not there are real demons in Yakuza at this point
[5:07:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> well 46 should be a good lvl right?

[5:47:46] <%AngryAsian5> THE BESTEST OF FRIENDS
[5:47:46] <+tigerfang86> "Looking forward to when we totally fight shirtless, Ichiban Kasuga"
[5:47:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Ichiban is special so they all have to take care of him.
[5:47:56] <heartlesshealer> Eri's lookin' out from the business dimension. Ready to jump out with the thumbtacks
[5:47:56] <fIashman92> Zhao sounds more like Majima than Majima
[5:47:56] <%medusasghost> the hottest duo in yakuza
[5:47:57] <SpeedFetishist> majima's so bummed out
[5:47:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ichiban Kasuga, Patriarch of the Trash Family
[5:47:58] <captain_demo779> WE MISS YOU GUYS!!!
[5:48:00] <+akscully> hey guys, remember massive man?
[5:48:01] <breakerdsx> You suck Daigo
[5:48:01] <%zanzibar_junker> KEEP GOING
[5:48:01] <%the22cstomp> Majima looks like an angry puppy
[5:48:02] <+tigerfang86> oh for sure
[5:48:04] <%QueequegTheater> Absolutely
[5:48:04] <+Seitine> Poor Majima got horny for no reason.
[5:48:05] <CrmznOgre> Does Ichi have ink?
[5:48:06] <iosephe> Yea
[5:48:06] <UlriktheSlayer1> totally
[5:48:07] <marvel877> Is Eri an optional character or is she not in cutscenes because she's a "ninja"?
[5:48:08] <colzack_> So @PatStaresAt thoughts on the english VAs for the old characters so far?
[5:48:09] <%Garthunox> Oh absolutely
[5:48:10] <PsychoPearl> Of course
[5:48:11] <+loukemia83> you BARELY beat them if you are the right level
[5:48:12] <heartlesshealer> true
[5:48:12] <moonmeh> incredibly so
[5:48:13] <%krispen_wa> Of course
[5:48:13] <%slrls_> the gang are basically scrappy civilians
[5:48:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> agreed
[5:48:13] <%Jaromero435> Daigo should die in 1 hit tho
[5:48:14] <hollydayskz> Arakawa basically saved them from being obliterated
[5:48:15] <%coreyyotto> They're like 60 years old though
[5:48:16] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Yeah its clearly a draw
[5:48:16] <%king_wragles> Ya, that would've been tacky if they just won
[5:48:16] <Blank9> it'd leave no room for growth
[5:48:18] <%machshop> they are no longer human
[5:48:18] <%NopeBadguy> It takes a whole party of JRPG chars to get them to stop holding back
[5:48:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt have em be mentors
[5:48:19] <%rdark_ksu> yakuza demigods
[5:48:20] <MasterTonberry23> Yeah if they beat them easy that would have been massive BS
[5:48:21] <@SoFarFetched> @marvel877 yeah she's optional
[5:48:21] <maegra> "Looking forward to fighting you Ichiban, in the DLC, available now for only 9.99
[5:48:21] <+abrupt_abe> They get a littl sweaty and tired and that's it
[5:48:21] <jazzcuzzi> they're low tier gods pretty much
[5:48:22] <TheHardM> Yeah, first game? Couldn't be a secure victory.
[5:48:23] <SirDogBear> They need to beat up the midcard more before they get the title shot
[5:48:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> @CrmznOgre hes got a dragonfish
[5:48:23] <pirreodda> ofc
[5:48:24] <%Blackleafx> @CrmznOgre Yeah he has a dragonfish jumping over a waterfall
[5:48:24] <+tigerfang86> 10 percent of majima and saejima's TRUE POWER is already way too much for them
[5:48:25] <%AngryAsian5> Majima has the biggest blue balls right now LUL
[5:48:25] <+PR0swagonist> just enough seats
[5:48:26] <mandalor89> I mean it is 2 60 year old men vs 7 30 year olds
[5:48:26] <%Monkeyweed21> or totally job without getting hits in
[5:48:27] <%QueequegTheater> @marvel877 She lives in the business dimension
[5:48:27] <bobbyratlair> @marvel877 shes optional
[5:48:27] <Sunstalker> As long as they don't beat them with their shirts off, Pat, it's fine.
[5:48:27] <%Garthunox> @CrmznOgre yes, a dragonfish
[5:48:27] <%StaceMcGate> 🍿 🍿 🍿 🍿
[5:48:28] <%Deano8817> @marvel877 optional
[5:48:28] <%Dunmarkh> It's like the demifiend fight
[5:48:28] <%DappercatEsquire> @marvel877 she's an optional character
[5:48:29] <ShawnEXE> I played the game pretty normally without crazy gear grinding and they BEAT my ass
[5:48:30] <Slim_Lipid> @CrmznOgre A Dragon Fish, cause it's "Like a Dragon" get it
[5:48:31] <CelestialCage> The gang are just slightly harder enemies
[5:48:31] <%HedgehogGames1> At the most, Ichiban would be a miniboss in the previous game.
[5:48:33] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Daigo's first move kills himself.
[5:48:35] <SGrim> Majima could probably cut through steel with one hand by this point.
[5:48:42] <%StebTheVee> No seat for Eri
[5:48:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> @marvel877 Not exactly optional, but she's not a story character
[5:48:48] <gungniir_> If they took off their shirts, then they'd be taking them serious
[5:48:51] <CelestialCage> We're just a buncha minibosses
[5:48:51] <DusK_The_Stray> They're not even sweaty
[5:48:52] <Lozovalazo1> Did take like 12 people and 7 lobsters to hold them off long enough
[5:48:52] <heartlesshealer> Majima got fight blue-balled
[5:48:53] <+tigerfang86> @PatStaresAt imagine if majima did the full windmill spin kick, they'd all die
[5:48:54] <DusK_The_Stray> I mean tired
[5:48:54] <Zbyrd0961> the equivalent of one low level mr. shakedown
[5:48:57] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> still below Mr. Shakedown
[5:48:57] <ghostkingwho> I think Ichiban is like Akiyama or Shinada tier
[5:48:58] <+rickelstiltskin> No Daigos first move, kills his friends
[5:48:58] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Were we just a late-game Shakedown encounter for Majima
[5:48:58] <%penitentpendant> How hype aggrivating would it be if they hit 50% hp then chugged a health drink back to full?
[5:48:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SGrim thats a waste of his hand
[5:49:02] <%MechArch> it's like jotaro on part 4
[5:49:03] <+toastedalmond1222> i got caught at level 40 in that fight...it didn't go well..
[5:49:04] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Eri is taking another phone call for business.
[5:49:06] <PsychoPearl> They're both 54. It's crazy
[5:49:12] <cheerthisdan> Your party is a high level boss fight when together minibuses alone
[5:49:14] <Blank9> your ENTIRE PARTY is maybe as strong as Majima in 0 by himself
[5:49:15] <PsychoPearl> They look so young
[5:49:21] <%Broken_Sonex> Diago should die in one hit tho. By his own move
[5:49:22] <+akscully> YEAH WE KNOW
[5:49:23] <%machshop> we know
[5:49:24] <%WhereIsWill> NANI
[5:49:29] <Sulfur_Boride> So Ichiban being the opposite of Kiryu also extends to his power level
[5:49:30] <%chanseychild> whoof
[5:49:31] <%krispen_wa> Yes
[5:49:36] <%Jaromero435> SAY SOMETHING DAIGO
[5:49:38] <Sulfur_Boride> Or their power levels, rather
[5:49:39] <%krispen_wa> DAIGO KILLED THE CLAN

[5:51:22] <%Blackleafx> JO REDEMPTION ARC
[5:51:23] <RazYamiyo> yakuza a dying pat
[5:51:28] <bobbyratlair> daigo is a worse chairman than terada, and terada was a LITERAL TRAITOR
[5:51:33] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt In other words, it's all Jo and Daigo's faults.
[5:51:39] <CrypticMochi> Honestly Daigo should’ve ended the Tojo long ago
[5:51:47] <SirDogBear> Arakawa's Tojo patriotism was as strong as the Boss BibleThump
[5:51:52] <mothmal> daigo's fine
[5:51:53] <Guardiansaiyan> @bobbyratlair so...on brand then?
[5:51:54] <CelestialCage> We already knew Daigo and Jo were shitheads
[5:51:54] <toadalonk> Legit Daigo doesnt derserve this much hate LUL
[5:51:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> @paladinstarbuster context: he thought a letter Kiryu wrote was for Haruka when it was for Daigo
[5:52:05] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> This excuse is terrible and contrived
[5:52:09] <Blank9> Why didn't Kashiwagi become the 6th chairman in 2 instead of Daigo? He was Kazama's right hand man for 20+ years by then.
[5:52:10] <+PR0swagonist> I'LL BETRAY THE TOJO SO NOONE ELSE HAS TO BETRAY THE TOJO
[5:52:11] <CelestialCage> Daigo a different brand
[5:52:13] <%Rain_Mage> Daigo Son of Kiryu
[5:52:15] <%jillpilled> couldn't allow the Tojo to be betrayed, so I guess I"ll snitch and destroy it myself
[5:52:17] <%Jaromero435> Do you think love can bloom on the battlefield Ichiban?
[5:52:27] <+tigerfang86> you're all like 55
[5:52:27] <%linSP> theyre just shitting on him
[5:52:28] <ryowildfire> 54
[5:52:28] <%StebTheVee> You're 50, Mjima
[5:52:33] <seaechiowai> Daigo looks nothing like his dad
[5:52:34] <tusk_act4> LUL
[5:52:35] <%Broken_Sonex> Reminder that Majima is 56
[5:52:36] <%chanseychild> Tojo loyalty on another level, we stan
[5:52:36] <@commanderclaw> Majima is 56
[5:52:38] <%HedgehogGames1> SO OLD
[5:52:39] <%NopeBadguy> Arakawa is probably in his 60s
[5:52:39] <%jillpilled> Majima's like 57 now
[5:52:40] <CelestialCage> @PatStaresAt he hasnt aged a bit
[5:52:41] <+PR0swagonist> majima is like 60
[5:52:42] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Majima is literally 55
[5:52:43] <PsychoPearl> They're 54
[5:52:43] <mandalor89> that would make the mid 60s
[5:52:44] <+toastedalmond1222> Majima in his 50s is what the average person is in their 30s.
[5:52:44] <hollydayskz> Majima is older than Kiryu and that's wild to me
[5:52:44] <+tigerfang86> REMEMBER ALL THE TIMES THE POLICE USED THE YAKUZA
[5:52:47] <+tigerfang86> LIKE ALL THOSE TIMES
[5:52:47] <%medusasghost> they're demigods pat they don't age ok
[5:52:49] <toadalonk> majima 54
[5:52:51] <+Seitine> And yet hot as fuck.
[5:52:55] <Ner234> Eternally twenty
[5:52:56] <CelestialCage> @PatStaresAt He looks and sounds 40 years younger
[5:52:57] <Blank9> here's something fucked up: Daigo and Ichiban are the same age, 42
[5:52:57] <%machshop> younger than adachi :)
[5:52:58] <PsychoPearl> 54
[5:52:58] <bobbyratlair> man people in this series just do not age do they
[5:52:58] <Sulfur_Boride> Once you join the Yakuza, you permanently look like you're in your mid-to-late thirties the rest of your life.
[5:53:01] <%SirGO0SE> Majima is 29 Kappa
[5:53:02] <CelestialCage> or 30\
[5:53:05] <%eyezehuhh> DILFS
[5:53:07] <+tigerfang86> Daigo remembers ALL THOSE TIMES he fucked up at the very least
[5:53:14] <NeroInfinite> K I R Y U
[5:53:15] <%Jaromero435> WATASE
[5:53:16] <%rdark_ksu> again, Japan, They age in like reverse dog years or something
[5:53:16] <%mister___doctor> Majima knows Hamon
[5:53:18] <Blank9> Daigo isn't a year older than Ichiban and he's been here since 2

[5:54:28] <%chanseychild> leave it to daigo to end yakuza
[5:54:29] <CelestialCage> @QueequegTheater Also i liked Nishitani
[5:54:30] <TheHardM> Daigo's best decision as the Tojo Chairman is to end the Tojo.
[5:54:30] <+sillyschlub> friendship with yakuza ended; now security is my best friend
[5:54:31] <+tigerfang86> DAIGO IS SO BAD AT YAKUZIES HIS BEST PLAN IS TO ACTUALLY END IT TO STOP MORE BAD SHIT
[5:54:31] <Idon__> NO MORE YAKUZA GAMES
[5:54:34] <Blank9> Tojo has been terrible since Yakuza 0 in the 80s
[5:54:34] <chaosbringer28> bring the entire underworld, down ontop on top of everyones heads
[5:54:35] <MasterTonberry23> to be fair its a miracle the Tojo lasted this long
[5:54:36] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What are they going to do now? Work at McDonald's?
[5:54:36] <feralspidey> that's literally just asking for a riot of thugs and gansters
[5:54:38] <BlueTunicLink> Bring in the warriors
[5:54:39] <Saltmeisterr> WHY THO?
[5:54:40] <TyrianPurpleHaze> That's HUGE

[5:54:50] <%Monkeyweed21> KIRYU'S LIFE WAS A WASTE
[5:54:51] <%Jaromero435> NO MORE YAKUZA GAMES
[5:54:51] <jorniev> yakuza 8 is gonna be insane
[5:54:52] <xbb1024> Yakuza traditions don't work well with today's global crime syndicates
[5:54:54] <KingFatality> WHERE WILL THEY GO FROM HERE
[5:54:55] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt How does this universe's narrative even continue without either the Tojo or the Omi
[5:54:56] <%zanzibar_junker> keep going PAT
[5:54:56] <jack_s1n> Daigo says fuck the tojo it's the worst
[5:54:57] <+BloodyBurney> The franchise becomes unrecognizable
[5:54:57] <%HedgehogGames1> The only thing Daigo can do successfully is kill the Tojo
[5:54:58] <curechan9> Good thing their aren’t other gangs
[5:54:59] <Lozovalazo1> End of YAKUZA. Start of DRAGON QUEST
[5:54:59] <RiverBirch> Hey its ProZD
[5:55:00] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> This isn't the end of the Yakuza, this is a POWER VACUUM
[5:55:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> @saltmeisterr "fuck it, this ain't working anymore"
[5:55:06] <%jillpilled> That's gonna make some huge fucking instability
[5:55:06] <+DarkBladeUltra> That's like if samsung and Microsoft agreed to just shut everything down
[5:55:07] <CelestialCage> @QueequegTheater pretty sure Crane guy survived?
[5:55:08] <%zanzibar_junker> KEEP GOING
[5:55:08] <MasterTonberry23> Theyre actually willing to really shake up the status quo. I like that.
[5:55:08] <SirDogBear> naw the universe will be even better, Kasuga Holdings vs Majima Construction PogChamp
[5:55:09] <%Blackleafx> @doc_ock_rokc its either that or the government takes control
[5:55:10] <scientiafidem> So I get this series is pro Yakuza, but... why is dismantling a crime family a villainous action? Like in the other games wasn't always a criminals vs way worse criminals type deal? How does this story justify the government taking down a criminal organization as a bad thing?

[5:55:52] <RiverBirch> ProZD is making a good point
[5:55:53] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Ichiban could never convince anyone he got isekai'd for a year.

[5:56:02] <TheHardM> Ichiban falls into a portal and meets Miyamoto Musashi Kiryu like in that one Yakuza spinoff.
[5:56:02] <%HedgehogGames1> Does Yakuza 1-6 even matter anymore?
[5:56:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yakuza 0-2: This Time Its Ichiban!

[5:56:05] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Go to Chicago, fight the remnants of the old Italian and Irish mobs

[5:59:20] <Blunder_Blue> @SoFarFetched Exactly though. In America, the title is 'Yakuza', but in this game they brought the Japanese title as the subtitle. I feel like going forward, Ichiban's saga will take the name 'Like A Dragon' in the west to both differentiate it from Kiryu's saga and also because the name 'Yakuza' isn't as fitting anymore.

[6:04:32] <%QueequegTheater> Why would you frame it like this
[6:04:33] <%krispen_wa> This is super weird
[6:04:34] <Sulfur_Boride> Could've added at least a color filter for the flashback
[6:04:35] <+tigerfang86> MANY DEFENSES
[6:04:37] <+toastedalmond1222> YOU MEAN WE CAN'T DO CRIMES NO MORE?
[6:04:40] <%Blackleafx> @MostRefinedCalla What, like Pat?
[6:04:45] <+TungstenViper> it's a flashback and flashforward
[6:04:45] <scientiafidem> throughout the world seems like an exaggeration.

[6:04:53] <+Seitine> NO MORE BIG CRIMES???
[6:04:56] <xbb1024> Defences, the Majima Everywhere system
[6:04:58] <SomeAsianDood> Daigo actually being smart???? NANI?
[6:04:59] <%HedgehogGames1> Could you imagine playing this game without knowing 0-6?
[6:05:02] <%televisedrevolting> Daigo's best plan was dissolving the entire thing
[6:05:03] <%chanseychild> oh great daigo can't fuck upbanythinv right
[6:05:03] <%NopeBadguy> The End of the Yakuza
[6:05:11] <cheerthisdan> DAIGO DOES A BIG GOOD
[6:05:12] <%Piemono> I don't really know what the play is here
[6:05:15] <+tigerfang86> I feel like you can start with 7
[6:05:15] <%MrBorisMakarov> THOSE DEFENSES WILL BE LIKE PAPER
[6:05:20] <jorniev> CRIME GOT CANCELLED SORRY EVERYONE CRIME IS OVER
[6:05:24] <MasterTonberry23> They definitely tried to make this game as friendly to newcomers as possible
[6:05:25] <CelestialCage> @PatStaresAt Ichiban missed 0 to 6 too
[6:05:27] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Pretty much
[6:05:33] <colzack_> They do a good job and explaining why this is a big deal
[6:05:33] <UlriktheSlayer1> ive only seen 0, and some of 1 and like bits from other games and im loving this
[6:05:33] <dmysta3000> CRYME TIME (FINAL)
[6:05:37] <%penitentpendant> New Yakuza Player Order: Yakuza 0, Yakuza: Like a Dragon
[6:05:39] <CelestialCage> @PatStaresAt Ichiban missed 0 to 6 too so its fine
[6:05:41] <BlueTunicLink> Daigo can't lead it, so he's throwing it in the trash to absolve himself
[6:05:41] <+tigerfang86> DAIGO PLANNED FOR THE SELF DESTRUCT
[6:05:45] <%Freakin_Wolfy> NO
[6:05:47] <%Freakin_Wolfy> YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE OTHERS
[6:05:48] <shadespiral> So Daigo played Ryo Aoki like a fiddle.
[6:05:50] <%Freakin_Wolfy> YOU HAVE TO HATE DAIGO
[6:05:51] <+loukemia83> TO SAVE THE YAKUZA WE MUST DESTROY THE YAKUZA
[6:05:51] <%Daniel_Is_I> GOLDEN AGE OF CRIME OVER
[6:05:51] <SunsetJack> Wouldn't a new clan just arise...?
[6:05:53] <VaudeVille_Villain_> Especially 6. That's the bad way that this goes.
[6:05:55] <bobbyratlair> ill give daigo some credit, hes the only character who still looks accurate to his age.
[6:05:55] <SirDogBear> it probably wouldn't have been a mess if the tojo had any other chairman besides Daigo LUL
[6:05:56] <%krispen_wa> DAIGO INTENTIONALLY WAS SHIT SO HE COULD END THE YAKUZA
[6:06:02] <CelestialCage> LEts just say the good parts of this plan are Watase's fault

[6:06:14] <Blank9> a new clan would get cracked down on by anti-yakuza laws too hard
[6:06:18] <SomeAsianDood> Daigo kept throwing the Tojo clan under the bus JUST FOR THIS MOMENT
[6:06:18] <jorniev> DAIGO GREATEST PLAN WAS DESTRYOING HIS OWN ORGANISATION
[6:06:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> @krispen_wa Sasuga Daigo Dojima

[6:17:02] <%Broken_Sonex> HEY DAD COULD YOU HELP ME UP?!
[6:17:02] <+abrupt_abe> Sure, sideways with Kiryu there
[6:17:02] <%kewlmyc> NAKAMA

[6:17:03] <%sporeian94> lol Pat's crying
[6:17:04] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Glad you kept playing?
[6:17:04] <%chibicheezit> kiryu i stg if these guys know including your "son" you sure as shit better tell or have told haruka
[6:17:05] <+tigerfang86> @Piemono Aoki is backed by the omi through his father's family
[6:17:05] <+PR0swagonist> THE GUITAR
[6:17:07] <DusK_The_Stray> How? Kiryu was there all along
[6:17:09] <VritraReiRei> All Majima's Doing Kappa
[6:17:09] <%televisedrevolting> @piemono Does really fuck the plan as much as ensure that Aoki has less muscle.
[6:17:11] <+CherteuseKapibara> lol kiryu didnt notice Joon gi han
[6:17:13] <Sunstalker> Hey dad, why'd you shoot me?
[6:17:13] <shadespiral> @Piemono It doesn't. They ensured the Kamurocho 3K plan succeeded, as part of their own plan.
[6:17:14] <+akscully> FOUND FAMILY FUCK YES
[6:17:14] <primarch_lupercal> It was all the Poundmates
[6:17:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> "I just called a Poundmates." "What?"
[6:17:15] <%penitentpendant> The feels
[6:17:15] <%televisedrevolting> *doesn't
[6:17:16] <+tigerfang86> CRY FOR ICHIBAN
[6:17:16] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the last few chapters are the hypest shit ever
[6:17:16] <+Jaysky> EAT THAT PEKING DUCK
[6:17:17] <daniphofani> the office lady is just standing there, lol
[6:17:17] <%linSP> thanks dad
[6:17:18] <CelestialCage> LET THE TEARS FLOW PAT
[6:17:19] <+Seitine> NOW TO KILL YOU AGAIN
[6:17:19] <TheHardM> Kiryu not showing up until now really lets you build a connection to Ichiban and the cast well before you see the Yakuza Legends.
[6:17:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I cried right here the first time.
[6:17:19] <+tigerfang86> YES
[6:17:19] <%Fooguwu> im crying too BibleThump BibleThump
[6:17:19] <+toastedalmond1222> @Piemono i think it's like: can't control Yakuza if there is no Yakuza
[6:17:20] <%chanseychild> its duck o clock
[6:17:22] <%st_jimmy456> you still shot me tho
[6:17:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> :(
[6:17:23] <%kewlmyc> BibleThump
[6:17:23] <+donpatrondx> im fuckin crying
[6:17:23] <+REDtheBEAST> NotLikeThis BibleThump
[6:17:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> When Ichiban starts crying.
[6:17:24] <%Dakuu75> aaawwww
[6:17:24] <pirreodda> sappy shit i love it
[6:17:25] <%AngryAsian5> AWWWWWWWW
[6:17:25] <%medusasghost> the tears are endless
[6:17:26] <Jonny_Uppercut> I still love they got his original English VA
[6:17:27] <+tigerfang86> BibleThump
[6:17:27] <shutupyouprick> @Piemono it doesn't, they let the 3K plan happen to help the dissolving of the Yakuza happen easier by splitting the Omi up. It only fucks up Ryo Aoki's plans since he doesn't know about it
[6:17:28] <heartlesshealer> Saeko just standing like nothing
[6:17:28] <%jillpilled> BibleThump
[6:17:29] <%Nekros4442> @Piemono The point of the 3K plan was to control the Yakuza. To control the underworld. Without the Tojo and the Omi it creates a power vacuum
[6:17:30] <Ner234> BibleThump
[6:17:30] <%krispen_wa> BibleThump
[6:17:30] <UlriktheSlayer1> oh fuck man
[6:17:30] <scientiafidem> I mean to be fair he actually didn't do anything, took off his jacket and then Majima just did everything.

[6:17:33] <Enajy314> BibleThump
[6:17:34] <Blunder_Blue> @Piemono It fucks up Masato's control and deprives him of the Omi. They used the 3K plan to 'kill' the Tojo so that the Omi could be spread thin across two cities in time for the dissolution.
[6:17:34] <+Seitine> Well shit now I'm sad.

[6:20:25] <%coreyyotto> And thousands of disenfranchised yakuza
[6:20:27] <CelestialCage> That camera work was a bit much
[6:20:28] <%krispen_wa> THESE DEATH FLAGS
[6:20:28] <SGrim> It's time for the plot to wrap up.
[6:20:36] <%sporeian94> MAJIMA CONSTRUCTION IS BACK BOYS
[6:20:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This conversation feels like it's the setup for Yakuza 8 btw.
[6:20:39] <Ner234> sigh...
[6:20:41] <%JeanGardner99> look at those npc's being polite and turning around when they get too close to the camera
[6:20:42] <Sulfur_Boride> Akiyama does help ichiban.... in the gacha game...
[6:20:44] <SirDogBear> that guy walking in place in the background PogChamp
[6:20:47] <narusao> he'll be fiiiiine
[6:20:47] <moodygabes> kazuma has a younger twin brother

[6:20:50] <%chanseychild> oh yeah, the government is still an issue huh
[6:20:50] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt
[6:20:54] <SGrim> That guy in the back just walking into a pole LUL
[6:20:54] <CelestialCage> @captain_demo779 Probably in some insane journey to build more for Sky Finance
[6:20:56] <%Grimlockfly> Game ended 2 chapters early
[6:20:56] <%Fooguwu> ghosts!
[6:20:58] <%maenos2> THAT MAN BEHIND HIM VANISHED
[6:21:04] <heartlesshealer> no eating peking duck together
[6:21:05] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This man died 5 minutes ago.
[6:21:06] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I was thinking the end of Saints' Row where the boat just explodes
[6:21:07] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> We must stop your treacherous son, Dad
[6:21:16] <%COMB711> any scene with this man is making me terrified of "-"
[6:21:17] <nmaten> did kiryu really just show up punch a dude then dip?
[6:21:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Chapter 15 is pretty short I'll say that.
[6:21:21] <%chanseychild> yakuza 8: viva la revolution
[6:21:22] <+CherteuseKapibara> signs of death include "..." and boats
[6:21:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's mostly cutscenes.
[6:21:26] <%HedgehogGames1> That boat would be a good sniper perch
[6:21:29] <heartlesshealer> suddenly npc with knife from behind
[6:21:29] <%krispen_wa> He looks like the UNdertaker right now
[6:21:30] <%Jaromero435> ARAKAWA PLEASE STOP THE FLAGS
[6:21:31] <marvel877> That ferris wheel is REALLY distracting
[6:21:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Yes Ichiban, I planned it all from the very beginning!"
[6:21:32] <$improbable42> The people glitching in the back is crazy distracting
[6:21:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @nmaten Nah he's still in town.
[6:21:34] <bobbyratlair> @COMB711 LUL
[6:21:35] <heartlesshealer> calling it

[6:21:47] <+Thelovelybison> Essence of death flags
[6:22:00] <CelestialCage> George Takei gonna die
[6:22:05] <+TungstenViper> someone is gonna kill him
[6:22:06] <RazYamiyo> BabyRage

[6:30:40] <digaogrunge> YOU DID IT
[6:30:48] <%penitentpendant> The real question: Did his 'son' shoot him?
[6:30:48] <UlriktheSlayer1> YEAH THEY DIS
[6:30:49] <%Niney_Who> Kiryu Tiger-dropped the bullets

[6:30:51] <Sol_Install> fuck
[6:30:53] <UlriktheSlayer1> did
[6:30:53] <+Chronobot> Saejima fuckin ate the bullets
[6:30:56] <%televisedrevolting> Yakuza protagonists are magnets for tragedy.
[6:30:56] <+toastedalmond1222> shoulda given Arakawa a Tojo Legend
[6:30:58] <Blank9> didn't spare bodyguards for arakawa
[6:30:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> What kind of IDIOT would try to assassinate Daigo when KIRYU IS IN THE ROOM
[6:31:03] <%machshop> @DusK_The_Stray no idea tbh, just figured soaking in the ocean would do something
[6:31:03] <%toastybites> IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DAIGO
[6:31:04] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So Kiryu and Majima just had bossfights with assassins offscreen
[6:31:05] <CelestialCage> Pat sad that Daigo lives another day
[6:31:06] <%chanseychild> @trllly its basically endgame lol
[6:31:07] <heartlesshealer> The kid's fucked
[6:31:10] <%AngryAsian5> Lol, guess those characters are safe for the rest of the game LUL
[6:31:11] <Sunstalker> I hope it's a set up and a fake death
[6:31:12] <BrickleBork> poor ichi
[6:31:17] <%NopeBadguy> @Too_Much_Nukie But Kiryu's supposed to be dead, remember
[6:31:18] <%HedgehogGames1> Arakawa dies and Daigo lives. Where is justice?
[6:31:18] <%Jaromero435> Sad Ichiban BibleThump
[6:31:18] <curechan9> Maybe the government
[6:31:19] <Hellarussian> Ichi is really going through it
[6:31:20] <shoukenz> damn daigo needed two bodyguards
[6:31:21] <bobbyratlair> goddamnit thats so much sadder than kazamas death
[6:31:23] <bobbyratlair> like by a lot
[6:31:24] <Sulfur_Boride> We lost Arakawa, but not Daigo.
[6:31:24] <%jillpilled> Why the ever loving fuck did Kiryu not go with Arakawa as backup

[6:40:43] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt there should be no more substories apart from romance and dragon kart
[6:40:43] <%Alazull> Like the emotional high of seeing Kiryu and the guys again, followed by that
[6:40:43] <%JeanGardner99> Story from here on out I believe
[6:40:43] <%jillpilled> WHAT A JOYFUL ENDNOTE

[6:41:14] <+abrupt_abe> Main story continues as strongly
[6:41:14] <%tawdymcstoic> ch 13 is one of the highlights.

[6:41:15] <%beepbeepbopbop> From here, shoot straight for story
[6:41:16] <%Alazull> You want to be around 60 for endgame

[6:41:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> octoAscend SEGA
[6:41:18] <heartlesshealer> that was some WHIPLASH
[6:41:19] <%JeanGardner99> Tuesday is when game is finished
[6:41:19] <%furiousfurioso> that's what I fuckin did and it ruled
[6:41:21] <%soflicar> well there is only one other side mission

[6:41:22] <%xbitwolf> best game ever
[6:41:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> that was an emotional fuckin' ROLLER COASTER of dickpunches
[6:41:24] <%AgniBrandt> There's a fuckton to process in those last several cutscenes
[6:41:26] <+superdeliverer> tormFill tormFill tormFill
[6:41:26] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you can probably do it
[6:41:28] <DusK_The_Stray> That Sega logo always seems to want to kill you.
[6:41:30] <%Dakuu75> "real yakuza use a gamepad" lol
[6:41:31] <jorniev> THAT PART WITH THE EYE WAS SO BRUTAL MAN
[6:41:31] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt You not gonna do the romance stuff? Those have their own substories.
[6:41:32] <%penitentpendant> Got the goofy stuff out of the way
[6:41:33] <%televisedrevolting> Hope you all are doing well and have a nice day. Sleep well.
[6:41:36] <seaechiowai> god damm sega title screen flashbang
[6:41:37] <%toastybites> imagine fighting the Roomba after your dad died
[6:41:37] <%coreyyotto> How many substories are even left?
[6:41:39] <ChungusQuest> Sadness-linked pupillary contraction prevented SEGA burn
[6:41:39] <%MikeTD81> you might wanna going to 60 or sp
[6:41:40] <@SoFarFetched> cause you did change saturday to more yakuza 7
[6:41:41] <ghostkingwho> game's pretty good
[6:41:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> Tuesday is perfect
[6:41:42] <%StaceMcGate> imagine fighting a monkey in a digger after that cutscene @PatStaresAt
[6:41:44] <%Mczutioni> reccomended level 60 for the last boss, so theres gonna be grinding
[6:41:45] <%tawdymcstoic> 7 substories are hidden by your personality stat btw @PatStaresAt
[6:41:47] <heartlesshealer> yeah good job doing them immediately
[6:41:48] <%AtlasMcCoy> Man that was rough
[6:41:48] <%Jaromero435> Now I just need to finish this before the next stream
[6:41:48] <%JeanGardner99> Imagine doing them now after that emotional shit
[6:41:52] <%Quinnman89> but did you see KIEYU
[6:41:54] <%krispen_wa> Yeah, tha's perfect
[6:41:55] <%JeanGardner99> Wacky zany shit whiplash
[6:42:00] <Sol_Install> You never did
[6:42:04] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> boooo
[6:42:06] <%Alazull> You can do all the romance in chap 15, since you can't get the wrap up until then
[6:42:06] <%penitentpendant> To the schedule!
[6:42:06] <+tigerfang86> FIGHT LEGENDARY YAKUZA
[6:42:07] <@SoFarFetched> it still would be pretty on brand
[6:42:09] <%AtlasMcCoy> Wait so is it yakuza or not yakuza
[6:42:10] <Xabbat_VersusXIII> Pure sadness in Yokohama
[6:42:10] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Watch him spend 2 hours finishing off the Dragon Kart Questline
[6:42:10] <%linSP> psaCrazyhead
[6:42:11] <heartlesshealer> nope
[6:42:11] <%owazowski> Perfect place to end
[6:42:13] <%jillpilled> the tonal dissonance would be so perfect though
[6:42:14] <+tigerfang86> THEN FEEL INCREDIBLE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA
[6:42:17] <CelestialCage> @jillpilled It also goes super well with the new gameplay style since him not being able to win fights without friends and crazy tactics
[6:42:18] <+tigerfang86> thaats YAKUZA
[6:42:20] <@SoFarFetched> changing it/not changing it is pretty on brand for Pat

[6:44:40] <%StaceMcGate> what is the name of the voice actor?
[6:44:43] <%charp35> Oh that sounds amazing in the worst way possible
[6:44:44] <%krispen_wa> ESPECIALLY DANTE'S VOICE ACTOR
[6:44:45] <%Dunmarkh> reuben langdon
[6:44:46] <Dr00_PhD> possibly moreso
[6:44:47] <mortificent> who did he voice?
[6:44:48] <%Monkeyweed21> thats the biggest cringe since Michel Ancel went on an instagram rant
[6:44:52] <KingVantq> yeah
[6:44:53] <%AzureGale> AWWWWWWWWW MAN
[6:44:56] <%Alazull> Also on Gamepass
[6:44:57] <%Garthunox> Yeah Reuben Langdon is absolutely nuts
[6:45:02] <%cvp5127> the switch port DansGame
[6:45:03] <%hahaha1171> play dragon quest
[6:45:12] <marvel877> Either crazy or assholes. Look at Jim Cummings.
[6:45:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If Arakawa's son was born in a soap land I bet he'd have turned out to be a good man.
[6:45:24] <Saltmeisterr> whats going on with reuben?
[6:45:31] <yaywalter> Dragon Quest XI is just Yakuza Like a Dragon 0
[6:45:33] <Saltmeisterr> what he do?
[6:45:33] <KingVantq> Pat never finished DQ 11 tdogSmile
[6:45:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Yea it was funny when Langdon believed in aliens n shit but then he fell down the Qanon Anti-Vax hole and now its a real shame
[6:45:43] <%krispen_wa> I hope to god we don't hear anything bad about Kyle McCarley or Yuri Lowenthal or JYB or anything
[6:45:44] <%Dunmarkh> @Saltmeisterr conspiracy theorys
[6:45:54] <CelestialCage> @Saltmeisterr He's just.... super conspiracy theorist
[6:45:55] <Saltmeisterr> ah
[6:46:02] <+dante_must_die_exe> Big Huge Downgrade in fidelity
[6:46:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> I don't like that you can't get the original anymore
[6:46:04] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It'll likely get mods and it's still DQ11
[6:46:05] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt You need a silly game tomorrow
[6:46:07] <%cvp5127> cause its the switch ver
[6:46:09] <%cylish> I like it on switch
[6:46:09] <mortificent> It Looks like shit
[6:46:13] <%YakumoYomi> They just ported the Switch version
[6:46:18] <GManx0> The Third act is just filler anyway
[6:46:19] <%twoto858> Are you ever gonna do a Final Fantasy game in preparation for FF16?
[6:46:20] <daniphofani> @PatStaresAt just play SNES mode
[6:46:20] <heartlesshealer> PC version is the switch port
[6:46:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> DQ XI S has more content but worse graphics yeah.
[6:46:21] <%KineKithZen> Eh, some people have their crackpot beliefs.
[6:46:23] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It's VERY likely it'll get graphical mods at some point since the original was also on PC
[6:46:24] <%Monkeyweed21> stream Total War
[6:46:27] <Blank9> there was sketchy stuff about quinton flynn recently
[6:46:31] <%cylish> oooo lets continue the suffering and try godfall tomorrow
[6:46:36] <%Garthunox> composer of the dragon quest music is a racist piece of shit, and fittingly enough the music is also shit
[6:46:39] <%TinyLittleDancer> DQ11s other than 2D mode has a lot of good QoL fixes
[6:46:51] <FstSergeant8595> Pat have you ever played Condemned Criminal Origins.
[6:46:53] <@SoFarFetched> chat kept telling him how to play LUL
[6:46:54] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Have you looked at Project Wingman yet since you like Ace Combat?
[6:46:55] <%YakumoYomi> It's just a better version of the Switch version (higher resolution and framerate)
[6:46:57] <@SoFarFetched> for Total War 2
[6:47:01] <+rickelstiltskin> also not the best game to stream either
[6:47:04] <Slim_Lipid> DQ11 is in the same situation that Burnout Paradise Was LUL
[6:47:07] <%linSP> 3080 tho
[6:47:15] <%chanseychild> stream raid sha-- nah I can't say it anymore
[6:47:15] <@SoFarFetched> which that also gets pretty bad if chat keeps shouting multiple things to do
[6:47:16] <%JeanGardner99> Its actually Twitch Plays Total War
[6:47:24] <%linSP> gotta get that 3090 then
[6:47:24] <%Mczutioni> If it shits its pants that just means the battle is amazing
[6:47:29] <Blank9> try out a roguelike from your old list, like cadence of hyrule's majora's mask dlc?
[6:47:30] <mortificent> oh yeah is the DQ composer still a piece of shit?
[6:47:31] <+rickelstiltskin> Just wish I could fuckin find a 3080 or 6800xt
[6:47:34] <heartlesshealer> PC version is the switch port, like how the FF6 pc version is the mobile port. Wasn't made to look good on the particular platform you're getting it on
[6:47:42] <%krispen_wa> Fuccintendon't
[6:47:42] <%YakumoYomi> Wait...Total War only takes advantage of four cores?
[6:47:45] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Yep
[6:47:52] <heartlesshealer> DQ composer IS still a piece of shit
[6:47:53] <%Broken_Sonex> God Woolie is slow....
[6:47:54] <%lastnamesilverlastname> Play Hades tomorrow
[6:47:55] <%cvp5127> one day
