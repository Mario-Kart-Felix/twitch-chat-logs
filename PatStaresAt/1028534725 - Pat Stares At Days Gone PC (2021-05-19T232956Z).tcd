[0:00:29] <%Dementedpenguin> This should be interesting.
[0:00:43] <%Dementedpenguin> I actually never seen footage of this game beyond its reveal LUL
[0:00:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Days (of Sanity) Gone
[0:01:04] <%CalderGaming> same
[0:01:13] <twoto858> i've seen small snipets and none of it looked impressive
[0:01:24] <blahblahgwar> MODOK
[0:01:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Nope its just zambambo shooter #2332
[0:01:50] <%Dementedpenguin> The most I've known about this game beyond its initial reveal are from Pat's tweets about it.
[0:02:02] <+ScottishMadJacko> I actually really like this game and the main character, sam whitworth does a good job with deacon
[0:02:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Why are you playing this now and now when the news came out about the studio director being a piece of shit? Did you pay money for this game even though it was free for PS+ last month?
[0:02:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sad part is the zombie genre has so much potential but hardly any game uses it
[0:02:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> I started playing and after a few hours and constantly being low on resources I had enough

[0:04:12] <kingmemelord97> wait what i though pat hatted this game?
[0:04:15] <laggy24111> days......... GONE!!!??
[0:04:16] <ForrestKrump> I GENUINELY mixed this game up with that Dying Light expansion for like a year and a half
[0:04:17] <mike2hands> DAYS GONE?? oh cool
[0:04:18] <%emperordread> don't forget to buy this at launch and fund the sequel guys
[0:04:18] <Mattais88> Wow, Days Gone and Starcraft 64 in one day. Castle Superbeast is really throwing out curveballs today
[0:04:22] <%jtdobyns> when Intergrade comes out June 10th... will Pat play the Yuffi Chapter on Stream?
[0:04:32] <%MidnightBurst12> So he wasn't joking
[0:04:36] <%maenos2> I'm sure he will
[0:04:46] <%Broken_Sonex> BUT DID PAT BUY IT AT FULL PRICE?!
[0:04:54] <Carquar> I see we've hit the "Pat hates himself" timeline
[0:04:57] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @jtdobyns I sure hope so!
[0:05:11] <+Dayube> not #sponsored
[0:05:14] <%maenos2> I'm down for the boys play shit era
[0:05:16] <%capnbeefs> I am interested in watching this one.
[0:05:17] <%holydeviant1> holydeviant1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! I had a mental image of a Disco Elysium sequel starting with Harry getting a new loud tie for his birthday and I'm making myself emotional send help
[0:05:18] <+megadblitz> when does pat not hate himself?
[0:05:21] <kingmemelord97> this gotta be a bit right ?
[0:05:23] <%tizz86> got my confirmation number for the gamestop drop today,  here's hoping the delivery guy dosen't steal it
[0:05:25] <ForrestKrump> We‚Äôve been in the ‚ÄúPat hates himself‚Äù timeline ever since that other, MUCH WORSE biker game
[0:05:29] <%valriot> LUL WHY
[0:05:34] <%king_wragles> It's pretty likely, but I don't think we've been given anything certain for Intergrade
[0:05:34] <%DaKnightWarrior> Meh game but a Top Tier Streamer psaDab
[0:05:46] <bob900000> well this is going to be interesting
[0:05:57] <+Mrrccava> ew why Days gone....eh its pat this will prolly be fun
[0:05:57] <DianaTheAscian> why is Pat giving this game the time of day anyway?
[0:06:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh hey it's that zimbabwe game
[0:06:12] <%saadi90> I stopped playing Days Gone after the 10-15 hour mark. It wasn‚Äôt bad. Wasn‚Äôt good either. Just bland
[0:06:13] <%jtdobyns> I do not care what game it is. Pat always finds a way to make it fun and interestingly funny.
[0:06:16] <Madovir> more like the time of days gone
[0:06:19] <Carquar> If anything, it'll be a good roasting
[0:06:22] <~PatStaresAt> JtDobyns that is very sweet
[0:06:25] <~PatStaresAt> but also not true lol
[0:06:25] <%Broken_Sonex> I don‚Äôt think this‚Äôll be as entertaining as Ride to Hell........
[0:06:28] <%sick_kickflips> @jtdobyns
[0:06:33] <%sick_kickflips> whoops
[0:06:35] <ForrestKrump> Gays Done
[0:06:36] <laggy24111> did you know its called days gone because time has in fact past. i know crazy right
[0:06:36] <+Mrrccava> @dianatheascian probably just cause it just came out? maybe he didn't play it??
[0:06:40] <$thegoldenattack> What's your verdict on RE8 @patstaresat ?
[0:06:45] <~PatStaresAt> its good
[0:06:47] <moonlitdream> Y are you doing this
[0:06:47] <%maenos2> in all honesty I vaguely recall KZ, Gigaboots, and Feel expressing enjoyment so that's probably why
[0:06:51] <+Mrrccava> @broken_sonex I think it could be close tbh looool
[0:07:15] <KCfusecoast> Hell yeah we ready for Days Gone on PC!
[0:07:16] <laggy24111> @forrestkrump Yes Gays Done üòÇ

[0:07:25] <%ssjklyco> Some games are just bad, like Kenshi
[0:07:27] <%sick_kickflips> Ethan vs deacon in a lousy protag contest
[0:07:29] <%Lion_kun> I think Pat is playing it because Doc insists it's the greatest sandbox game ever
[0:07:29] <+yungkame> days gone is pretty ok
[0:07:36] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> r e l o a d
[0:07:44] <DianaTheAscian> @Mrrccava isn't this game like a year old now?

[0:07:56] <laggy24111> but seriously is this game actually good?
[0:08:06] <%sick_kickflips> @laggy24111 eh
[0:08:06] <ForrestKrump> The Days of relevancy for this game, are in fact, Gone.
[0:08:09] <+megadblitz> wasn't days gone a glitchy mess? did it recently get ported to pc?
[0:08:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> it was free on PS+
[0:08:12] <xeeebaaa> i like deacon

[0:08:19] <joebeilieves> Get ready for speaking to yourself for 70% of the game
[0:08:26] <bob900000> all I've heard about this game is that it's really mediocre
[0:08:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Meh game is meh
[0:08:31] <@CreepyPorpoise> Not sure what made Pat want to play it though

[0:15:25] <%DaKnightWarrior> That's fair.
[0:15:26] <%JoshManVGH> So we get to know too!
[0:15:27] <+Mrrccava> a great port of a mediocre game....does that make it 7/10 IGN perfection?

[0:16:39] <%NeoCre> Cheer500 Hey Pat, I legit loved playing this game. Have to say that it drags at first, starts hitting its stride after a few aiming upgrades and new weapons. Applies to the story too (drags at first, then gets MUCH better)
[0:16:42] <+ezlo_86> not really
[0:16:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's not that bad
[0:16:44] <BoneofMalkav> I expect literal Days to be Gone LUL
[0:16:45] <%Dementedpenguin> OOF

[0:20:34] <+senfood> Oh my god, he did?
[0:20:35] <$hewlettfan96> ??
[0:20:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS WAS A SHITSHOW
[0:20:40] <deviljhojho_> Because reggie kicked his ass
[0:20:43] <%chance_h> Woolie played a retro game again, highjinks occurred.
[0:20:46] <sirtommygunn> Reggie won a game on accident
[0:20:46] <kingmemelord97> isnt star craft 64 the cult classic ?
[0:20:47] <%thetunnelhomer> Yup
[0:20:51] <NewWillinium> Woolie the Salt King said as much
[0:20:53] <%dankgerald> Reggie threw down
[0:20:55] <%bevyrage> yup, they knew nothing about starcraft and then woolie got beat by reggie wholesale
[0:20:55] <%Agami23> its not that hard
[0:20:55] <%RetroCop87> Woolie said the Best Friends would have done it better
[0:20:55] <%Monkeyweed21> REGGIE KNEW NOTHING AND STILL WON
[0:20:55] <bob900000> he said best friends would have done a better job
[0:20:58] <rcand9> he told reggie and minh you arent pat liam and matt
[0:20:58] <Carquar> Wait, they played Starcraft 64? I saw the notification but didn't think it would be the 64 version xD
[0:21:02] <iosephe> LUL
[0:21:03] <%SveriSageAdvice> Woolie made an assumption that Minh knew how to play Starcraft
[0:21:04] <%Lion_kun> Woolie literally said it was the first time he wished he did the video with the best friends
[0:21:05] <Mattais88> Drone rush
[0:21:05] <Vyskus> Woolie admitted that it was the first time he had the thought "The SBFP would have done this video better"
[0:21:06] <%emperordread> #TeamReggie woolieKICKDAD
[0:21:06] <%jorniev> ZERG RUSH?
[0:21:06] <balthazar758> oh yeah, it was woolieTRASH

[0:21:12] <$hewlettfan96> Starcraft 64 whys it a shitshow
[0:21:19] <tetragom1> 4 player is the competitive standard
[0:21:19] <%bevyrage> reggie did a drone rush on accident and woolie never tried building zealots with his gateway to counterattack
[0:21:20] <gslayer14> that would've been a good time
[0:21:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie said it would have turned out better if he played with you and Matt LUL
[0:21:23] <%GraceTBM> GraceTBM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! It's not all improvements, but I actually prefer the new lighting in ME:LE. My memories of ME1 are of blacks crushed to oblivion, and scenes drowning in shadows. Now I can see the environments, and appreciate the color palette more.
[0:21:25] <%AncelDeLambert> you played a lot of Terran, rigth?
[0:21:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Starcraft was on Nintendo64??!?!?!
[0:21:28] <%Daxalog> It was a probe rush. The WORKERS. He lost to that.

[0:21:42] <%AncelDeLambert> HE LOST TO A PROBE RUSH?!
[0:21:43] <%RetroCop87> I played W3 in 4v4 so no one could see how bad I was
[0:21:46] <NewWillinium> He lost to Zerg Workers! Zerg Workers!
[0:21:48] <Idon__> Just teach it to him in fighting game terms.
[0:21:48] <marvel877> BEST FRIENDS BRAWL: THE LOST BATTLES

[0:22:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They played foe 30 minutes then switched lol
[0:22:03] <problemagic> kusoge
[0:22:04] <%Daxalog> I think the joke was that they talked about it. And he assumed they knew more. It happens sometimes.
[0:22:11] <%thetunnelhomer> He lost hard to a probe rush, and ended the stream super early.
[0:22:14] <%AncelDeLambert> ... it only takes three basic Protoss units to counter that

[0:22:30] <%jorniev> good
[0:22:30] <NewWillinium> Seeing Starcraft 64 with my own eyes was one of the most horrifying things I have ever seen to a game I belove
[0:22:32] <%g0atmeal> it's true, I watch fewer streams when I wanna play the game myself first
[0:22:37] <%Puhff> LUL
[0:22:39] <gslayer14> another option could've just been roguelike runs as bonus streams

[0:28:03] <%emperordread> From the article called 'Please Don‚Äôt Romance Garrus Or Tali In The Mass Effect Remasters' "They are fantastic characters, even in Mass Effect‚Äôs stacked deck, but they don‚Äôt belong to you."
[0:28:03] <+Mrrccava> and Femshep belongs to garius.

[0:28:09] <BoneofMalkav> Choose your color of ending LUL
[0:28:10] <$SGrim> 3 is okay. The multiplayer was awesome
[0:28:10] <NewWillinium> Garrus is also romanced by that one French Doctor
[0:28:13] <%AncelDeLambert> just about horrendous allergic reactions
[0:28:13] <nivlac_555> ah
[0:28:15] <+LionKagura> @thetunnelhomer Hell yea

[0:28:28] <+ScottishMadJacko> Ive played through them all on the legendary and im having a blast
[0:28:28] <DianaTheAscian> "YOU NEVER WATCHED DEATH NOTE"

[0:28:33] <MucousMembrain> I remember 3 being ok, but I was also like 13 when I played it
[0:28:34] <problemagic> it's a trip
[0:28:35] <twoto858> That would be fun
[0:28:35] <+Credfield_> "romanced" also known as big smash his squidgy alien dick
[0:28:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wouldn't playing all 3 take a  long time
[0:28:36] <+ToaDeathax> that's gonna be a marathon.
[0:28:37] <%Monkeyweed21> A LOT OF TERRIBLE STUFF TOO
[0:28:38] <%thetunnelhomer> It use to be so terrible
[0:28:39] <+Jack8274> Would you replay 1/2 with the new gameplay?

[0:28:58] <+evbites> the article says let garrus date tali because it's too stressful for the player
[0:28:59] <+Mrrccava> is the horde mode still apart of 3 in the LE?
[0:29:01] <M0untain_wolf> plus?
[0:29:01] <%lucky_icarus> 3 is great, its just the ending really
[0:29:04] <xeros720> played a bunch of me3 multi, never touched the story

[0:29:41] <M0untain_wolf> Newgame+ is such a great feature
[0:29:41] <nivlac_555> damn
[0:29:42] <tales_911> I just started the stream and it was just Pat staring slackjaw at the camera. I thought the stream froze for a sec
[0:29:45] <%Ritei> LUL sbfpSetIn LUL
[0:29:46] <MucousMembrain> You killed him pat
[0:29:49] <%Puhff> rip that guy
[0:29:49] <%Monkeyweed21> you can even skip the bad parts in NG+
[0:29:50] <%BoxNavy> they are playing with a friend, they said
[0:29:53] <%xmetalicdemonx> he's now living in the woods
[0:29:56] <%RonaldMcDownload> Foxsploder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[0:29:56] <%Master_Van> On a new data center?
[0:29:56] <%bassoontyphoon> what are we talking aboot
[0:29:57] <ChatNinja> The embarrassment
[0:29:58] <+notgarza> Sub=canceled
[0:30:11] <peyodogo> just get through ARR you cowards
[0:30:14] <peyodogo> gets good then
[0:30:15] <+BIumen> there is no payoff if you dont experience the boring stuff
[0:30:25] <%cvp5127> when does the story get good?
[0:30:27] <+Greywyn00> the story IS the game
[0:30:28] <problemagic> just signed up for the trial
[0:30:31] <+OmegaWeltall> yea cause of the Heavensward quests are REALy good
[0:30:31] <Profmcstevie> There's so many PEAKS in that "boring stuff"
[0:30:32] <%xmetalicdemonx> then why was it so boring.  gotem
[0:30:34] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The story is legit really good
[0:30:34] <+ItalianWaifu> do you get exp by doing the old quests
[0:30:35] <ammobasket> What boring stuff
[0:30:35] <%dantejoestar21> ARR Reallllyyy sucks though
[0:30:37] <Blank9> I'm going to be in ARR for probably months
[0:30:37] <peyodogo> @cvp5127 after ARR
[0:30:37] <+Kingtut9009> I tried getting through Realm Reborn, it was not doable
[0:30:40] <rcand9> 3 has lots of issues not just the ending imo like Leng
[0:30:41] <%RonaldMcDownload> I never knew about NG+, maybe I oughta go back to 14
[0:30:41] <Pengers> It‚Äôs not boring though
[0:30:44] <%jorniev> 14 needs some ugly guys to play as, i wanna be a lizard guy on my rpgs
[0:30:47] <%Ritei> a story skip is just buying a save file for a single player jrpg that puts you in the final dungeon
[0:30:47] <%BoxNavy> hrothgars are cool B)
[0:30:47] <%cvp5127> damn
[0:30:48] <%Monkeyweed21> its like the crazies that skip all cutscenes to do the Raids faster
[0:30:49] <+Calek> I went through the story twice because I skipped the cutscenes the first time around
[0:30:49] <Puhff> 2.0 has peaks and valleys but it's all  peaks from 3.0 on
[0:30:59] <+ZipperHands> People really need to look at FFXIV and it's expansions like TV Seasons so they can stop giving these brain dead takes
[0:31:00] <+RyTYoung> woo!
[0:31:01] <DianaTheAscian> awwwwwwwwww

[0:33:10] <%Raikouija> Also wanted to say, rip to this game not getting a sequel
[0:33:10] <+ZipperHands> @peyodogo FFXIV is 100% a TV show and people thinking they should do the jump potion to get to the new content is like watching Season 4 of Castlevania without watching the previous ones cause it's "new"

[0:33:30] <bananakohai> indica is sleepy one
[0:33:30] <%Arek_1> Indica.
[0:33:32] <%jackythefrost> The main reason FFXIV is so popular is cause of its story.
[0:33:32] <%Puhff> INdica
[0:33:35] <%emperordread> oh you wanna get knocked out? Indica then
[0:33:35] <%GraceTBM> That's super fair

[0:35:12] <%Wallabri> Dark Knight
[0:35:13] <%Monkeyweed21> Dragoons too
[0:35:15] <%apostateCourier> oh shit ninja and machinist
[0:35:19] <+Calek> <3 Machinist
[0:35:19] <%MugenSandan> Does Dragoon count
[0:35:21] <DianaTheAscian> no
[0:35:21] <marvel877> I kinda want to play Legendary Edition because I've never played the original versions.
[0:35:21] <RaidenRising> thanks dude
[0:35:22] <%BoxNavy> yeah dragoon
[0:35:23] <%LonePlus_> warrior?
[0:35:25] <+LionKagura> @Mattais88 You saying he doesn't? LUL
[0:35:26] <Psyramics> mch doesnt summon a stand, mch summons a mech
[0:35:26] <+Greywyn00> everyone gets a stand
[0:35:29] <%BoxNavy> kinda
[0:35:30] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[0:35:32] <%Puhff> @KeiganOfAstora it's really more about the terpenes and cannabanoid profiles. every weed is different. check the labels if you're in a legal area
[0:35:33] <%apostateCourier> nah dragoon just has a battle aura
[0:35:33] <Laecerelius> Machinist is less stand and more "BIG O, SHOW TIIIIME!!"
[0:35:35] <%Ritei> in ffxi, not in ffxiv
[0:35:35] <%StrawberryPantsu> Stand implies ghost or apparition
[0:35:37] <%thetunnelhomer> If Dragoon counts then Warrior counts.
[0:35:38] <Blank9> a stand doesn't have to be humanoid
[0:35:39] <%MugenSandan> actually no Dragoon is a transformation state
[0:35:40] <%dantejoestar21> nah
[0:35:41] <%Wallabri> NIN has a stand?
[0:35:41] <M0untain_wolf> Mass effect Elysium Would be nutz
[0:35:42] <+Calek> Machinists need to be riding a mech by the end of Endwalker

[0:35:51] <%apostateCourier> the frog, wallabri
[0:35:51] <%Monkeyweed21> If Mech counts so does Dragoon
[0:35:54] <%LonePlus_> my fell cleave is my stand bitch
[0:35:58] <%LonePlus_> inner release deez nuts
[0:35:58] <Qsmash_> what counts as a Dragoon exactly? Kappa

[0:44:38] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt He threatened that dude at gunpoint to put her on the chopper. There's a part of me that hopes when he gets to that camp he finds out they shot her in the head immediately.

[0:45:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> The motorcycles look painfully slow
[0:45:08] <+MackFighters> you can upgrade it later
[0:45:09] <%marsproject> Wet road
[0:45:09] <@SSaryn> That's cause it is.
[0:45:09] <munitalprats> IT LOOKS SO SLOW
[0:45:09] <+sjay662> it gets faster

[0:45:16] <%marsproject> Gotta go slow else you spin out
[0:45:17] <Dragovus> Chase down Leon to force him to continue the Redfield Bloodline
[0:45:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> U P G R A D E S
[0:45:19] <+redthebaron> it looks like slower than a horse
[0:45:20] <ape_hawk> its a Hardly Davidson
[0:45:23] <+Mythicalbrit> why is he using a radio he's RIGHT infront of you
[0:45:23] <ForrestKrump> Time to RIDE‚Ä¶ FOR HELL
[0:45:25] <M0untain_wolf> Zombie Deers
[0:45:26] <MucousMembrain> it's cause theyre cruisers, edemucate urself
[0:45:27] <%Raikouija> Chris: THATS IT! DEACON, I NEED You to continue the bloodline
[0:45:28] <+redthebaron> like THE DEER WAS FASTER
[0:45:28] <%TheWinged7> immersion broken, deer didnt stand in the road
[0:45:30] <+Mrrccava> Maybe like it was designed so that there was tension
[0:45:33] <%MugenSandan> GET GREASY STEVE
[0:45:37] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Catch Leon while also having a jaunty ride to hell: retribution
[0:45:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea it's smooth and looks decent
[0:45:40] <heartlesshealer> you wanna go super fast on overgrown roads?!?!
[0:45:41] <%Broken_Sonex> That is in fact a not fast pace
[0:45:43] <+RyTYoung> PFFT
[0:45:44] <atgithursdays> Going 30 MPH on post apocalyptic roads in the wet
[0:45:46] <thelonechris> "This should be on Ride with Norman Reedus."
[0:45:47] <atgithursdays> Seems resasonable
[0:45:52] <%BoxNavy> YOU CAN NEVER CATCH GREASY STEVE AFTER THIS
[0:45:52] <cyb3r_demon> greasy steve and da bois
[0:45:52] <%bassoontyphoon> This reminds me of the chase scene in Knives out with how slow they are
[0:45:53] <+Mrrccava> NO THEY ARENT. THEY ARE THE LAMEST
[0:45:55] <Laecerelius> Gotta fuck some ladies while still fully clothed

[0:46:08] <gslayer14> why the loudest thing yeah
[0:46:09] <Wolfstriker121> dont question it!
[0:46:09] <%Daxalog> Noise right?
[0:46:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> Bikes are easiest to maintain
[0:46:11] <+ScottishMadJacko> You get mufflers later
[0:46:11] <cyb3r_demon> choppers are
[0:46:11] <+Mrrccava> they pick the loudest thing in existence
[0:46:11] <+FoolsArcade> Motorcycle would be a HORRIBLE idea in zombo apoco
[0:46:11] <Oxybe> BUT 1%
[0:46:12] <+YabbaTroll> You think the bikers would get rid of their Harleys?
[0:46:12] <%Alazull> This almost makes less sense than Mad Max
[0:46:12] <deviljhojho_> deafish
[0:46:13] <WG101> don't worry about it
[0:46:14] <%g0atmeal> freaker apocalypse

[0:46:16] <%Wallabri> loud and unprotected!
[0:46:17] <TheFramedWarlock> Yes they are pat !
[0:46:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> But you're too fast
[0:46:17] <mr_saturday93> I mean so are cars...
[0:46:18] <Sunstalker> very poor fuel efficiency too, no?
[0:46:18] <+evbites> BUH BIKERS MAN
[0:46:19] <Wolfstriker121> LET  IT BE PAT!! lol
[0:46:20] <+Greywyn00> and have no shielding
[0:46:20] <+redthebaron> but they are fast
[0:46:20] <RaidenRising> very loud
[0:46:21] <%Tman451> Harley's specifically
[0:46:21] <+KaneCube> They put it in silent mode
[0:46:22] <GameOver_Here> And provide no protection
[0:46:23] <iosephe> Ride or die
[0:46:23] <skyentombment> PRESS TRIANGLE TO BOOST AND STFU
[0:46:23] <cyb3r_demon> street bikes can be way quieter
[0:46:23] <@SSaryn> Ok and?
[0:46:23] <+ScottishMadJacko> Thats one of the upgrades later on
[0:46:24] <%DukeMoose> ITS COOL THOU
[0:46:24] <heartlesshealer> the freakers are all gone tho
[0:46:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> You're too fast for it to matter
[0:46:25] <ForrestKrump> THEY‚ÄôRE COOL!
[0:46:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pretty fuel efficient tho
[0:46:26] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt one of the upgrade types includes mufflers
[0:46:26] <blue8moon> but how gas tho?
[0:46:26] <%dankgerald> bikes get good mpg, easy to maintain
[0:46:27] <%MajorCrasher> SHUT UP THO
[0:46:28] <cs0402196> I'd assume Long Boards are the way to go.
[0:46:28] <Tracazoid> Yeah but style tho
[0:46:28] <mr_saturday93> Some cars
[0:46:28] <Virokwet> Vijeo FArmes
[0:46:29] <kingmemelord97> shhhhhhhh dont think about it
[0:46:30] <+redthebaron> PAT THE ZOMBIES CAN'T KEEP UP IT IS FINE
[0:46:31] <%JoshManVGH> So you've gotta be a SUPER BADASS to ride one durring the Zombie Apocalypse!!!
[0:46:31] <Blank9> they are also loud for raiders
[0:46:32] <%emperordread> But they symbolise the trail blazing free spirit of America
[0:46:33] <MucousMembrain> but theyre cool so yknow
[0:46:33] <+MackFighters> easy to fix, fast, not much gas needed
[0:46:33] <atgithursdays> They can be less loud
[0:46:34] <Mattais88> That's not cover
[0:46:34] <Psyramics> cars are so much quieter than motorcycles
[0:46:34] <TheFramedWarlock> That is an actual mechanic in the game  Pat
[0:46:34] <@SSaryn> But wait what was the question
[0:46:34] <%facto905> theyre used to scare the freakers
[0:46:35] <thelonechris> There's always that one asshole who gets on his motorcycle at 2 AM
[0:46:36] <skyentombment> IT'S THE SAME SCENES EVEN
[0:46:36] <%Raikouija> They‚Äôre maneuverable
[0:46:36] <Shinny1338> they don't have to be
[0:46:37] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt but they're cool though I guess
[0:46:37] <+Mrrccava> BUT DO YOU HEAR MY COOL BIKE?? IS MY DICK BIG YET
[0:46:38] <%Maids4lyfe> actually motorcycles have good fuel efficiency
[0:46:38] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @Sunstalker the opposite actually, bike are good on gas
[0:46:39] <+LvckyLvc> #freakergang
[0:46:40] <%saadi90> So are guns.
[0:46:41] <balthazar758> it depends
[0:46:43] <+KaneCube> You can't pop a wheelie in a car or on legs
[0:46:45] <Blank9> see the gun people heard them coming
[0:46:45] <no123450n> IF they were quiet, how would people know how cool they are?
[0:46:48] <Carquar> Motorcycles are infinitely louder lol

[1:07:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea that's how it works

[1:07:33] <$realm_forge> You‚Äôre harvesting the CPU
[1:07:34] <+Exicuren> Depends of the car, sometimes the car filter, spark plugs, bolts, etc,
[1:07:34] <munitalprats> it'd probably be real shit

[1:07:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> yup
[1:07:38] <Profmcstevie> "Heart of a V8, once belonged to a mighty beast that roamed the lands"

[1:07:42] <+projectmanatees> When are you Gona learn to drive?
[1:07:43] <%Daxalog> You have to break the Car's tail for more parts.
[1:07:43] <balthazar758> depends on the juice

[1:07:45] <cyb3r_demon> sticks
[1:07:46] <%ThirdWelles> Take his muffler bearing
[1:07:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Eventually you can upgrade it so the triangles stay around longer
[1:07:48] <%hrbeck_> Pat, if you pop the hood- theres all kinds of things you can take out of it! some might even be usable!
[1:07:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's a freaker nest pat

[1:07:51] <ammobasket> dude's out here stealing dipsticks
[1:07:52] <ForrestKrump> Car Zandatsu
[1:08:00] <+emperri> does detective vision ever do anything but make a game tedious for brain goblins
[1:08:00] <%psidefx> The piston loin chops
[1:08:00] <%Ozavic> @BettyMwwaahh It can break up a combat heavy game which can be nice, but I'd rather have 3 big chests rather than 20 boxes of shit
[1:08:00] <$floralkami> isn't there like at least 4 different car juices in each car?
[1:08:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's a freaked nest
[1:08:03] <+BettyMwwaahh> to be fair he isnt a detective
[1:08:03] <$realm_forge> ITS A CAR NEST
[1:08:04] <ApexJaggi> Is there a setting for the detective vision to make it less horrible?
[1:08:04] <Aydarkzero> good to know
[1:08:05] <LorcaNomad> man this game is awful it's the best
[1:08:13] <%BoxNavy> A Dark Souls
[1:08:18] <+JustToWatch> Boot Knife is Unbreakable
[1:08:18] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> only when the car juice is ripe
[1:08:21] <$floralkami> Appreseeate
[1:08:22] <+Greywyn00> you can only roll in Dark Souls Time
[1:08:24] <munitalprats> confusing and a bit cliche
[1:08:25] <+AbnormalVoid> Ye
[1:08:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> All cop cars have ammo
[1:08:29] <Profmcstevie> GOD I hate looking at that detective vision dude
[1:08:30] <+fetrigon> ye
[1:08:30] <Asblom> can upgrade freaker vision
[1:08:31] <%ThirdWelles> But does it seem fun?
[1:08:32] <%Tman451> give it time
[1:08:33] <brachydios777> Why would one play this over Last of us 1?
[1:08:35] <deviljhojho_> its like one of those b movies that take themseves seriously
[1:08:39] <huuwahh> @PatStaresAt you're in tutorial mode still, you get to roll whenever you want later
[1:08:40] <+sjay662> wait till you see the rippers, they are the dumbest
[1:08:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh no more FREAKERS
[1:08:44] <PartyFavors> the story thus far seems... inoffensive
[1:08:45] <+democrazyyy> i really like how deacon mutters to himself. sam witwer is so good at acting insane
[1:08:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people might just be haters
[1:08:47] <jman13131313> It is a good game
[1:08:49] <deviljhojho_> last of us 1 doesnt have THE BOOZER
[1:08:52] <%GalacticaPhanto> @keiganofastora you know for us minority freakers
[1:08:52] <+AbnormalVoid> fart echolocation
[1:08:55] <+emperri> is this the meth apocalypse
[1:08:57] <Aydarkzero> marking enemies PogChamp
[1:08:58] <packers81> It takes a while to get interesting
[1:08:59] <+Exicuren> Some cars cna have the cpu extracted, or the alarm, airbag packs, there's quite a lot od variety that you can salvage from cars
[1:09:02] <@SpaceCapnCrone> become a binoclard
[1:09:02] <blackjack8182> give it time. Second half is amazing
[1:09:07] <%Robot_Nixon_> that door is an enemy monkaS
[1:09:08] <Mattais88> But what if you're enemy isn't named mark?
[1:09:09] <Saltmeisterr> nice ui
[1:09:10] <%ThirdWelles> I cannot believe this game calls them Freakers
[1:09:11] <deviljhojho_> there seems to be a dangerous lack of meth so far
[1:09:13] <PirateMike_> btw where is the flashlight?
[1:09:14] <%ThirdWelles> That's so stupid
[1:09:14] <+evbites> God this is such a gumbo game
[1:09:16] <+senfood> Yo, that menu doesn't look bad.
[1:09:17] <@SSaryn> Now put the Car Organs into yourself
[1:09:19] <friedsquidiot> my friend worked on the game, it was so fun to blame every glitch we encountered on him
[1:09:20] <%jacintafor> why would you need to mark zombies @PatStaresAt
[1:09:21] <$realm_forge> Now you can see car ghosts
[1:09:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I like the game. I wouldn't have tried it without it being free on PS5, but I enjoy it
[1:09:25] <+MackFighters> YES
[1:09:26] <Tooniearcade> this so far seems not bad
[1:09:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:09:27] <jbrachob> nah
[1:09:28] <+democrazyyy> i think so at least LUL
[1:09:28] <%Deft_Thought> Freddie Freakers coming your way
[1:09:29] <jman13131313> yes
[1:09:30] <Sunstalker> It's okay?
[1:09:32] <deviljhojho_> its possible
[1:09:32] <+sjay662> its totally fine
[1:09:32] <Riorii> this was the first open world game that didnt burn me out tbh
[1:09:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> That vision stuff gave my OCD such a nightmare of "I gotta get everything"
[1:09:33] <Aydarkzero> i've heard this game was decent
[1:09:33] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its ok
[1:09:34] <mangohelmet> it's alright
[1:09:34] <deviljhojho_> FREAK OUT
[1:09:35] <TheFramedWarlock> Yes
[1:09:35] <+evbites> LAST OF DEAD CRY
[1:09:35] <munitalprats> Pat will give a game as many points as possible so long as its got bonus loot
[1:09:36] <%g0atmeal> dark scene, bright white menu
[1:09:36] <+fetrigon> get fucked
[1:09:38] <brachydios777> maybe?
[1:09:38] <Virokwet> LUL
[1:09:39] <@SpaceCapnCrone> this game is aggressively mediocre
[1:09:41] <+Greywyn00> well at least it isn't offensively bad
[1:09:42] <yourliteraldog> These guys aren't racist enough to be in a motor cycle gang
[1:09:42] <Madovir> it seems like a "skip the cutscenes" game
[1:09:42] <%ThirdWelles> It looks "fine"
[1:09:42] <%s1rcuit> @friedsquidiot LUL
[1:09:42] <%Undenizen> it looks kinda generic
[1:09:43] <+Exicuren> It's kinda yank, but it's pretty fun
[1:09:43] <OzdotTV> gief snore <3
[1:09:43] <%Deft_Thought> Zombie action fight?
[1:09:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat you just said the plot was confusing to the point of hilarity, by default that makes it not great
[1:09:44] <+emperri> it will never get a sequel because you didn't preorder it for $70 sony dollars
[1:09:45] <Profmcstevie> Perhaps you just have bad taste, it's always possible
[1:09:45] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean Shy has a radius where any game regardless of how good it is will literally just melt on her so maybe it's the same here?
[1:09:46] <ProjektRF> Its almost like people never actually played it lol
[1:09:46] <blackjack8182> It‚Äôs good
[1:09:47] <mangohelmet> the zombie hoards are the best part of it
[1:09:55] <balthazar758> that guy got freaked
[1:09:57] <%ThirdWelles> Dude I barely saw that prompt
[1:10:00] <thelonechris> The UI isn't bad, but it's a little "clean" for a gritty zombie biker game
[1:10:00] <%Deft_Thought> Oh shit, it did?
[1:10:01] <@SSaryn> Yeah that's fair
[1:10:01] <+AbnormalVoid> I couldn't tell you did anything
[1:10:01] <%Tman451> I also couldnt, I took damage there
[1:10:05] <+emperri> cell phone btw
[1:10:06] <$realm_forge> Oh shit MMA zombies!
[1:10:06] <%jackythefrost> its slow but it gets pretty fun
[1:10:06] <%Piemono> This game can't be good, you didn't buy it at full price on release date
[1:10:07] <munitalprats> these FREAKERS
[1:10:08] <ApexJaggi> There's a setting to make mash X into hold X.
[1:10:11] <+ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt Can we talk about using your knife as a Lockpick, because thats a stupid thing to use a knife for
[1:10:12] <%Deft_Thought> I didn't see a prompt
[1:10:13] <%g0atmeal> how is a zombie supposed to be able to jump scare like that
[1:10:15] <mangohelmet> also Deacon never stops talking
[1:10:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> yeah it was a very low visibility prompt
[1:10:17] <+paladinstarbuster> kid sleeping bag
[1:10:18] <@SpaceCapnCrone> the grapple escape prompt changes too, but it gives you a lot of time
[1:10:18] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt Its a random button pat, not only x
[1:10:18] <+emperri> friends of freaker
[1:10:19] <brachydios777> There was a prompt?
[1:10:20] <%BoxNavy> freddy freaker's house
[1:10:20] <mangohelmet> you're gonna hear a lot from him
[1:10:21] <ToneBacas> some games do that thing with prompts in the 3D space
[1:10:23] <Laecerelius> Suplex that freaker!
[1:10:23] <%ThirdWelles> It was practically transparent
[1:10:23] <%Skelegroove> Those prompts are completely invisible in some sections
[1:10:23] <+Exicuren> I would recommend to choose the hold button instead of mashing button option
[1:10:24] <Klarrann3> This looks like a higher def State of Decay
[1:10:24] <$RealThiele> pre-marital sex caused this
[1:10:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @patstaresat change the settings so you don't have to mash X
[1:10:31] <%ThirdWelles> Like smaller than the character's hand
[1:10:32] <%BoxNavy> what a narc
[1:10:32] <%Raz_Pataz> gottem
[1:10:33] <%Deft_Thought> NARC ALERT
[1:10:34] <%GalacticaPhanto> LUL LUL
[1:10:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt There are options to change the hold and mash stuff
[1:10:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> owned
[1:10:37] <Mattais88> When all you have is a hammer...
[1:10:37] <semachie> LUL LUL LUL
[1:10:37] <gallohuegos> owned
[1:10:38] <mangohelmet> isn't he just breaking the lock, not picking it?
[1:10:39] <balthazar758> oh shit
[1:10:40] <ProjektRF> Got ourselves a fucking narc
[1:10:41] <deviljhojho_> NARC
[1:10:41] <@SSaryn> I mean, if you want a 25% chance of just breaking your knife than sure
[1:10:43] <balthazar758> hide the coke
[1:10:43] <munitalprats> i mean
[1:10:44] <Aydarkzero> damn lol
[1:10:45] <thelonechris> Did 2 days pass?
[1:10:46] <%s1rcuit> I've unlocked a door with a knife before
[1:10:46] <%psidefx> tell em Pat
[1:10:47] <+ScottishMadJacko> i think you can increase the prompt size
[1:10:47] <munitalprats> you would fuck your knife up
[1:10:49] <%NeoCre> There‚Äôs a setting to change mash x to hold x
[1:10:51] <+Exicuren> That's why, the prompt is kinda weird
[1:10:51] <munitalprats> like SERIOUSLY HARD
[1:10:52] <RealDurdyDan> Oh hi narcx
[1:10:53] <+BettyMwwaahh> @Ozavic thats better atleast. it just makes it exuasting playing the game on a second playthrough. so i usually dont
[1:10:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> lemme just push this fucking pickup by myself
[1:10:55] <Aydarkzero> an encounter!
[1:10:55] <yourliteraldog> No Narcs here bro
[1:10:56] <+sjay662> its square on PS4 with the pink, probably hard to see the dark blue X
[1:10:57] <%Deft_Thought> Good thing everyone put their cars in neutral before the apocalypse.
[1:10:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just make everything hold and never worry again
[1:11:00] <PirateMike_> Mate wait till you hear some of the line deliveries
[1:11:01] <%Ozavic> Good thing the parking break wasn't on
[1:11:02] <lol_red_ranger> DIC
[1:11:03] <+emperri> watch out for the witch
[1:11:06] <%ThirdWelles> Real narcs break into cars, Pat
[1:11:07] <%NeoCre> Fair
[1:11:08] <%KineticZen> I love the jam
[1:11:09] <xxshadowxx416> did he push that truck
[1:11:11] <Ner234> POP

[1:19:39] <%s1rcuit> which is more embarrassing: losing a war to birds, or losing a war to meth?
[1:19:39] <%LonePlus_> this is a horizon zero dawn isnt it

[1:19:52] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Sneaky time, Pat
[1:19:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's very confusing what you're doing for what mission
[1:19:54] <xxshadowxx416> meth

[1:21:31] <%TheWinged7> ney-asts?
[1:21:32] <+sjay662> SET THEM FREE PAT
[1:21:32] <+Svennigan> I wonder if there'll be some penalty for killing the children
[1:21:35] <+evbites> @BoxNavy yes
[1:21:37] <OnlyGreatGames> Omg Pat I saw your stream announcement and had NO IDEA what game you were playing
[1:21:39] <%Ozavic> @BoxNavy I like it so yeah
[1:21:40] <%BoxNavy> theyre just chillin man
[1:21:41] <deviljhojho_> so they dont even alert the herd
[1:21:41] <+RyTYoung> Gonna start new game plus on days gone for the shits and gigs rn
[1:21:42] <M0untain_wolf> Pat those arent Meth people its all the hipsters after Portland gets nuked
[1:21:44] <balthazar758> they don't attack right away huh
[1:21:45] <deviljhojho_> or horde or whatever
[1:21:50] <$Jetfandam> let the meth kids stay at their roof...I guess?
[1:21:50] <goddamndavid> @Mattais88 I disagree but respect your opinion
[1:21:51] <%ThirdWelles> They're like hyenas
[1:21:51] <Louie_Salmon> @BoxNavy Just make a stupid man with 1 int
[1:21:52] <NewWillinium> Are those. . . *kids*?
[1:21:53] <PirateMike_> Well basically they indicate that there might be so good shit where they dont want you to go
[1:21:59] <Profmcstevie> Don't anger the witch now
[1:21:59] <ApexJaggi> Couldn't make killing child freakers a requirement I guess.
[1:22:02] <Aydarkzero> so they just vibe up there until you bother them
[1:22:02] <+evbites> @NewWillinium yup
[1:22:03] <%Raikouija> it makes sense, if a zombo apocalypse happened children zombos would be a thing
[1:22:06] <deviljhojho_> no they are meth heads
[1:22:08] <+emperri> stoop kids afraid to leave their stoop
[1:22:08] <$RealThiele> set her free
[1:22:08] <%BoxNavy> thank you chat :)
[1:22:08] <%ThirdWelles> Only fuck with you if you're easy prey or if you fuck with them first
[1:22:18] <%chance_h> This game needs a smooth talking narrator
[1:22:21] <deviljhojho_> wow so zombie children are useless too
[1:22:22] <+RyTYoung> @aydarkzero yeah or get close to them
[1:22:23] <deviljhojho_> damn
[1:22:33] <thelonechris> So did the zombies just gather a bunch of sticks and branches and drag them into a gas station?
[1:22:33] <+emperri> pat fucking shoot something
[1:22:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I would look in front of your Pat, there a real enemy behind you in the red
[1:22:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> stealth kill
[1:22:36] <PirateMike_> @ApexJaggi Its encouraged tho lol cuz they defend loot
[1:22:38] <%BoxNavy> hes very hungry
[1:22:38] <%ThirdWelles> I want a Louisiana zombie game
[1:22:39] <+emperri> my murder boner is uncontrollable
[1:22:40] <stantheman_97> huh that's interesting

[1:22:44] <RaidenRising> too busy with his meth
[1:22:45] <%ThirdWelles> I want zambos in the bayou
[1:22:46] <studleydoorite> I bet zombie children are quieter than regular ones
[1:22:46] <yourliteraldog> do stealth
[1:22:47] <goddamndavid> i wonder if they are children that become freakers or the freakers are banging and making freaker children
[1:22:52] <%Puhff> he busy
[1:22:52] <@SpaceCapnCrone> rain does make you significantly harder to hear
[1:22:54] <%Robot_Nixon_> meth heads see only movement
[1:22:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> stealth him
[1:22:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> He doesn't have much left in the brain department Pat\
[1:22:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> he munchin
[1:22:58] <%Ynkubus_> He's enjoying spare ribs
[1:23:00] <%kknutson4> rain probably helps

[1:23:24] <DrkJP520> Sup, nerds
[1:23:24] <M0untain_wolf> Jesus Pat...
[1:23:32] <ApexJaggi> Evil Within 2's enemies had better eyesight.
[1:23:35] <OzdotTV> maybe it's cuz I live in the wrong part of Oregon or I don't go out much, but I hope to witness a meth people horde one day
[1:23:36] <%Raikouija> dayum
[1:23:42] <goddamndavid> @evbites terrifying
[1:23:45] <+AbnormalVoid> stealth seems OP lol
[1:23:46] <heybenice> Reminds me of evil within 2
[1:23:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he was busy eating. I know NON zombies who are like that
[1:23:49] <balthazar758> more than ok
[1:23:50] <CatRidder> take their clothes like hitman
[1:23:52] <$RealThiele> knife goes in, guts come out
[1:23:54] <thelonechris> Your character must be strong as shit to shove a knife all the way through a skull
[1:23:55] <horsesaredumb> @ApexJaggi is it that bad here ? üòÇ
[1:24:01] <+RyTYoung> Stealth works really well, bit harder to be stealthy with humans
[1:24:03] <Aydarkzero> it's gross that means enemies LUL
[1:24:03] <yourliteraldog> icky pooy
[1:24:04] <+AbnormalVoid> go into the poop truck, pat
[1:24:09] <deviljhojho_> The orgeon meth hordes are one of the great wonders of north america ya know. You cant die without seeing one at least once
[1:24:11] <+emperri> the apocalyptic gas price of $2.29
[1:24:11] <+Exicuren> It's the tutorial, enemies are pretty much  blind in this part
[1:24:21] <deviljhojho_> a what now
[1:24:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> You're leaving the mission area

[1:25:26] <%kknutson4> it's also cracked on PC
[1:25:28] <BUNS_holt> is this just a tour of oregon? it seems pretty normal tbh
[1:25:28] <%Ozavic> According to the Hanky Code, an old way for gay men to identify each other in public, a red hanky worn in the back left pocket like that means that Deacon is looking to Fist someone!

[1:28:52] <%TheWinged7> yup, right through the plaid pants
[1:28:53] <%OutofPots> The game forces you to
[1:28:58] <%hrbeck_> motels in small towns are often larger because they have fewer passing business and often have seasonal renters
[1:29:00] <+RyTYoung> nothing new, we've seen cyberpunk LUL
[1:29:00] <+emperri> imagine TLOU being more generic
[1:29:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just get as many bottles for Molotovs as possible
[1:29:03] <BerryliciousDefinition> We've all been there
[1:29:08] <corepercentlives> to survive we must putt hands thru dicks

[1:30:09] <%DukeMoose> oil filters fat
[1:30:10] <+archangel9889> How do you know!
[1:30:10] <BerryliciousDefinition> They're genetic freaks, and they are NOT normal
[1:30:10] <+admiral_of_crunch> Nah just rip out a pipe and fill it with cream fondant
[1:30:11] <Riorii> oil filter
[1:30:11] <PirateMike_> IT MAKES SENSE PAT
[1:30:11] <%LymanAl> Oil filter
[1:30:13] <%LonePlus_> oil filter
[1:30:13] <%Daxalog> They do now
[1:30:13] <twohitgood> oil filter as an improvised silencer

[1:30:13] <FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt Oil filter
[1:30:13] <%marsproject> homemade suppreser
[1:30:14] <+FackinCrazy> oil filter

[1:30:17] <%CalderGaming> oil filter
[1:30:17] <Slim_Lipid> just take the muffler out of the ENGINE BLOCK HahaThink
[1:30:17] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt oil filter
[1:30:17] <+ArkhamBenji> Oil Filter
[1:30:17] <%WhereIsWill> oil filter
[1:30:17] <goddamndavid> looks like an oil filter
[1:30:18] <%Raikouija> thats an oil filter
[1:30:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Mufflers
[1:30:18] <%flechet> it an oil filter pat
[1:30:19] <IminyourBase> that looks like an air filter or oil filter
[1:30:20] <%AzureGale> Improv silencer
[1:30:20] <yourliteraldog> You can use an oil filter as a supressor
[1:30:21] <twohitgood> it's not that effective IRL.
[1:30:22] <BigNerdSam> There are gun attachments you can buy that can repurpose oil filters as silencers
[1:30:22] <+LionKagura> @PatStaresAt pil filter
[1:30:22] <frankavich> It's an oil filter!
[1:30:24] <%NeoCre> Oil filter
[1:30:24] <%Arek_1> ATF will be on your ass now!
[1:30:27] <FutaSnek> THAT ACTUALLY WORKS
[1:30:27] <%chance_h> it's a soda can lol
[1:30:27] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  Oil filter and No.
[1:30:28] <%Monkeyweed21> THERES NO HOLE
[1:30:29] <+LionKagura> oil filter
[1:30:30] <FutaSnek> NOT ALOT
[1:30:30] <+Exicuren> and they actually muffle handgund sound quite well
[1:30:32] <FutaSnek> BUT IT WORKS
[1:30:35] <+HefestoForges> shooting punches a hole in it?
[1:30:36] <heybenice> Car silencer
[1:30:40] <$RealThiele> watter bottle would be a better improv silencer id imagine
[1:30:41] <Slim_Lipid> that better add fire damage to the bullets
[1:30:41] <blackjack8182> it works irl
[1:30:42] <+emperri> you don't hide pistol silencers in every conceivable crevice? it's like you're canadian or something
[1:30:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> car people in the chat
[1:30:49] <Riorii> it kinda works but nowhere near the effect of a real supressor
[1:30:49] <+chiazam> YOU CAN SHOOT GAS CANS
[1:30:50] <%jorniev> NO SHIT! THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!?
[1:30:50] <FutaSnek> @HefestoForges YEs
[1:30:51] <PirateMike_> Someone else say Oil filter I dont think we got it
[1:30:52] <LorcaNomad> WAIT WHAT THE FUCK DOES AN OIL FILTER DO FOR THE GUN I'M SO CONFUESD
[1:30:54] <semachie> remember when army of two hhad you using soda cans as suppressors lol
[1:30:54] <%baka_sugoi> oil filters can be used as a "suppressor"
[1:30:56] <+admiral_of_crunch> I'm going to make a wild guess and say this suppressor will be absurd is SOME way other than in and of itself.
[1:30:59] <%Gogogolem> Thats a good way to blow off your hand.
[1:31:02] <+Vigonept> what yall never changed yer own oil?
[1:31:07] <Mattais88> Acts as a silencer
[1:31:08] <IminyourBase> big door for big freaker
[1:31:08] <+HefestoForges> ty @FutaSnek
[1:31:09] <Dragovus> BOSS ARENA!
[1:31:11] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:31:14] <+emperri> boss arena
[1:31:16] <%flechet> its just that "silenced" guns are still hella loud
[1:31:17] <+BettyMwwaahh> why no like? big boom
[1:31:17] <%trustycoyote> naaaah totally fine
[1:31:18] <IminyourBase> totally a boss arena
[1:31:20] <thelonechris> Waist-high cover
[1:31:22] <%Tman451> It wouldn't last long at all, but it would work if you could attach it somehow
[1:31:23] <scrublord009> Patdown
[1:31:24] <+admiral_of_crunch> Look it's a boss arena fight the big hammer zombie from Dying Light I guess
[1:31:26] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt have you seen the RE8 mod where every time you look at Lady D, her hat gets bigger?
[1:31:27] <$RealThiele> boss fountain this was
[1:31:32] <+emperri> CHILD BOSS
[1:31:34] <Mattais88> But finding one that treads onto you're gun would be a pain
[1:31:36] <heybenice> Wouldn‚Äôt the heat from the firing ignite the leftover oil residue?
[1:31:38] <Riorii> thats great
[1:31:39] <+Exicuren> @jorniev yes that actually works in real life, there are videos in youtibe showing how well they muffle sound
[1:31:44] <RealDurdyDan> monkaS children
[1:31:50] <+LionKagura> @ShinobiPhoenix not really its just a thing most people into guns know at some point in time it was found out you can use one as a supressor
[1:31:52] <$RealThiele> red barrel is red
[1:31:58] <zaxitor> people die when they are killed
[1:31:59] <+emperri> boss fountain
[1:32:02] <thelonechris> Something gonna burst through that garage door
[1:32:03] <FutaSnek> The oil in the filter absorbs and suppresses the gas from the barrel as it fires essentially acting as a homemade suppressor, they'll wear out quickly though and throw off the balance of the gun IRL
[1:32:05] <%BoxNavy> DIE KID
[1:32:05] <Riorii> D:

[1:33:41] <+LionKagura> Yea you just stood there
[1:33:41] <%Arek_1> A car YouTuber recently got a visit from the police in suspicion of using oil filters as makeshift suppressors.
[1:33:43] <+ChaosedStar> @ChaosAethr no, especially the kids.
[1:33:43] <%Dementedpenguin> This is how little I knew about this game: this is the first I'm aware of the kids LUL

[1:34:06] <+brothernerofgc> this game screams hidden gems youtube video in five years
[1:34:08] <+emperri> maximum machine spirit
[1:34:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Molotovs would OP if you could hoard them

[1:34:31] <+senfood> Inflammable means flammable?!
[1:34:32] <%garagon31> @IminyourBase Crazy Willie's sounds like a person. Whacky Willies sounds like a pee pee store.
[1:34:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> @NeoCre Like in DOOM
[1:34:35] <+admiral_of_crunch> You seem... well-equipped.
[1:34:37] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT
[1:34:40] <Laecerelius> gonna burn out those nests for the tasty, tasty items?
[1:34:45] <+ScottishMadJacko> yellow marker
[1:34:46] <+redthebaron> the thing for the bike
[1:34:47] <$RealThiele> id like my free filter please
[1:34:47] <+Fooguwu> PATRICK
[1:34:47] <ForrestKrump> I missed some of the stream, are the Days Gone yet?
[1:34:48] <%LymanAl> Bike
[1:34:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Get into the garage
[1:34:49] <yourliteraldog> kill children
[1:34:51] <+emperri> 1. find fuel pump 2. get a death wish
[1:34:52] <+MackFighters> 'car'
[1:34:54] <%cache_22> Go to the yellow triangle. The motorcycle's fuel pump.
[1:34:55] <IminyourBase> fuel pump is part of a car
[1:34:57] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you're looking for a fuel pump for the bike, not the fuel station's pump
[1:34:59] <+Exicuren> Yellow marker in the minimap
[1:35:01] <%AnIcedCoffee> "Car" there's only ONE vehicle type
[1:35:02] <Asblom> engine part fuel pump
[1:35:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> fuel pump is a part, it's in the garage
[1:35:25] <+Fooguwu> same name = same thing
[1:35:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ammonition
[1:35:32] <goddamndavid> i sure hope your brother is doing okay
[1:35:36] <%LymanAl> That's how flashlights work
[1:35:40] <%Gogogolem> so, the thing about fuel pumps.
[1:35:41] <%Alazull> So let me get this straight, this guy knew this place well enough to know he could get the part he needed, but not that it was a zombie nest?
[1:35:46] <%Raikouija> thats convienent
[1:35:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> where would you most likely find a fuel pump for a vehicle...
[1:35:50] <+Riecharus> Cool detail, when you fire with a silencer, it makes a little hole in the tip of the silencer.
[1:35:55] <%Undenizen> can't you just take that bike?
[1:35:57] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:35:58] <%marsproject> BOOZER!!!
[1:36:00] <%AzureGale> F
[1:36:00] <thelonechris> F
[1:36:01] <%Gogogolem> Is they are really modulgar and its unlikely you could just grab a random fuel pump you find and use it.
[1:36:03] <+emperri> diceman
[1:36:04] <$RealThiele> oh no. anyways....
[1:36:05] <+admiral_of_crunch> That's one crappy flashlight, and it's ability to phase through walls and furniture belies that this is an open-word game.
[1:36:07] <ApexJaggi> Gotta be fuel in here somewhere. Nobody else would've thought to loot it.
[1:36:09] <+senfood> BOOZEMAN
[1:36:10] <yourliteraldog> BOOZE MAN

[1:36:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Urizen and Myrizen
[1:36:21] <mayormanders> not boozeman
[1:36:22] <blackjack8182> Boozer
[1:36:24] <BerryliciousDefinition> They were ripping and tearing
[1:36:24] <+senfood> His full name is John Boozeman.
[1:36:25] <+admiral_of_crunch> *Is* this an open world game?
[1:36:32] <%BoxNavy> crackheads monkaS
[1:36:32] <+BIumen> so rippers arent people
[1:36:32] <Aydarkzero> WHAT

[1:36:36] <WG101> what the fuck
[1:36:37] <goddamndavid> lol good thing he was only a 20 second walk away
[1:36:37] <%s1rcuit> @Alazull you know the location of every nest in and around your house?
[1:36:37] <%AzureGale> DAMAGED

[1:41:32] <SPidERMan8576> Medium rare arm
[1:41:32] <%MechArch> totally no homo
[1:41:33] <+admiral_of_crunch> Chances on Boozer dying anyways? Just to drill in the futility of saving him?
[1:41:37] <%TheWinged7> just gesture withy our fucked up arm
[1:41:39] <%s1rcuit> surprised he didn't go into shock
[1:41:39] <yourliteraldog> DO NOT FALL ASLEEP with that injury

[1:41:42] <+YabbaTroll> oof
[1:41:45] <PirateMike_> ***
[1:41:47] <+evbites> WHY
[1:41:49] <Yinlock> "i definitely won't commit suicide the second you exit this room"
[1:41:50] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[1:41:53] <%chance_h> u have 1 are dude, how are you going to use it?
[1:41:54] <cyb3r_demon> lol
[1:41:54] <BigNerdSam> I love how Deacon's like "I want the shotgun tho"
[1:41:54] <PirateMike_> OOF
[1:41:55] <thelonechris> Oh no
[1:41:56] <%Daxalog> 0_0
[1:41:56] <Yinlock> (i don't know if he actually does)
[1:41:57] <+chiazam> ASSHOLE
[1:41:59] <+YabbaTroll> chekovs suicide shotgun
[1:42:00] <PirateMike_> Why is my clip fucked
[1:42:01] <%AnIcedCoffee> Because fuck you it's his
[1:42:02] <xcompleasedad> He would be LITERALLY defenseless without it
[1:42:02] <%MrBorisMakarov> NO GIVE SHOTGUN
[1:42:05] <jtsoppy137> he said MY GUN LUL
[1:42:06] <Blank9> he needs to protect himself
[1:42:06] <Profmcstevie> ...you have one usuable hand fuck off
[1:42:07] <+admiral_of_crunch> If he had the shotgun last time, his arm would've been okay
[1:42:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Level 0
[1:42:08] <+ChaosAethr> but shotgun
[1:42:08] <DrkJP520> Just walk it off. You don't need to treat that burn
[1:42:08] <%Dementedpenguin> Deacon seems SUPER nonchalant about this
[1:42:09] <yourliteraldog> Shot gun pssuicide
[1:42:11] <PartyFavors> S A F E
[1:42:14] <BUNS_holt> @ShinobiPhoenix because it's last of us if ellie was a motorbike
[1:42:18] <ApexJaggi> Deacon's wishing he let Boozer die to keep that shotgun.
[1:42:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> locker though
[1:42:20] <Profmcstevie> He can have a pistol, it's one handed
[1:42:20] <Oxybe> @patstaresat are u a bikie man from a bikie gang living in my crack den making crack
[1:42:21] <blue8moon> come back to find him dead
[1:42:23] <cyb3r_demon> thats almost one whole part of a story line
[1:42:25] <+Exicuren> Yup, now the game is open
[1:42:25] <+redthebaron> drifter crossbow
[1:42:25] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> what if firewatch had a gun safe
[1:42:32] <balthazar758> the plot
[1:42:32] <Sunstalker> I like how Gief has slepth through this entire game LUL
[1:42:33] <yourliteraldog> The lack of urgency here is concerning
[1:42:33] <+emperri> can you get an Agony Crossbow
[1:42:34] <%Undenizen> if he wanted to commit suicide he'd ask for the pistol.
[1:42:35] <Yinlock> see this crossbow is for hobos, making it more powerful
[1:42:39] <+JackedBrain> @JackedBrain is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[1:42:41] <+TheMorilo> is patrick having fun?
[1:42:42] <$RealThiele> hobo x-bow
[1:42:43] <xxshadowxx416> last of biker
[1:42:44] <%Ozavic> Why do you have those?
[1:42:45] <heartlesshealer> gief is baby
[1:42:45] <+admiral_of_crunch> @ShinobiPhoenix This game is about riding your Ellie?
[1:42:58] <Riorii> i didnt even use crossbow
[1:43:03] <+Relzak> i beat the story and didnt even find a crossbow
[1:43:04] <heartlesshealer> sounds about right
[1:43:06] <%vitoxxi> this game feels like tomb raider 2013
[1:43:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> How long does that take?
[1:43:07] <thelonechris> So it's only good if you use 1 weapon?
[1:43:12] <yourliteraldog> very chill about your dying friend
[1:43:12] <$bootysteve> I hear a fatty pig dog snoring
[1:43:19] <$RealThiele> ignore these meds boozer
[1:43:21] <Asblom> game gets good when you get good
[1:43:21] <%AnIcedCoffee> Doc is insane for thinking this game gets good at all
[1:43:22] <+Exicuren> Only because it's silent, but at that point you habe like a whole arsenal of guns and rifles
[1:43:22] <ForrestKrump> Shit did I miss a suicide
[1:43:24] <beefcakemanthrob> i may need to play this again with crossbow then
[1:43:25] <Oxybe> Big snores
[1:43:25] <semachie> crossbows are neat
[1:43:26] <Louie_Salmon> "Games where you kill things with bows and then pick up the arrows" should be it's own genre
[1:43:28] <cosmicdischarge> Full LP or one and done @PatStaresAt
[1:43:30] <jamsbybetty> pat you left your sawmill going
[1:43:35] <SaltyAzteca> them stats
[1:43:39] <%AzureGale> The Ride with Norman Reedus?
[1:43:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> If I ever make a videogame I'll make the menu backgrounds black as tar
[1:43:45] <%Alazull> Them being called freakers makes me giigle
[1:43:48] <heartlesshealer> crossbows never killing in one shot makes sniping stealth worthless, so it's not fun for those kinds of people
[1:43:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @admiral_of_crunch wrong responder, I am not making that comparison
[1:43:49] <%chance_h> never say never pat
[1:43:49] <%Alazull> *giggle
[1:43:50] <+ScottishMadJacko> This game is long as fuck
[1:43:53] <%Sain_127> mr pat

[1:43:59] <@CreepyPorpoise> Oregon pretty
[1:43:59] <+emperri> more like days oregone
[1:43:59] <%Undenizen> i mean, the danger with having your arm cooked is infection. the thing he needs more than ANYTHING is disinfectant.
[1:44:06] <%jorniev> COUNTRY ROOOADS
[1:44:06] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt there's a perk in survival that lets you pick up shot bolts, I suggest getting it now
[1:44:07] <Mundkipz> you should one up woolie and do starcraft 64
[1:44:11] <Sunstalker> Thank god trees don't consume meth

[1:44:18] <RealDurdyDan> It's just eczema
[1:44:18] <beefcakemanthrob> i want to see pat take on a horde

[1:44:26] <%marsproject> It will soon enough
[1:44:26] <%trustycoyote> lil bit
[1:44:26] <%jorniev> YES
[1:44:27] <@SpaceCapnCrone> thus begins muttering Deacon
[1:44:28] <jtsoppy137> looked like raw meat
[1:44:28] <%AnIcedCoffee> It really doesn't
[1:44:29] <cyb3r_demon> ya shoulda been black
[1:44:30] <%Mr_Pylon> there should be holes
[1:44:31] <%MrBorisMakarov> it was PRETTY bad tho
[1:44:31] <%CalderGaming> it'll look worse once it's infected
[1:44:32] <BigNerdSam> There should have been more bone
[1:44:32] <mai_cu> yeaaah he could still kinda move it
[1:44:33] <BUNS_holt> his arm should've been cooked to the bone, considering they had it in one spot only
[1:44:33] <+evbites> It looked bad
[1:44:34] <heartlesshealer> Yes
[1:44:34] <Louie_Salmon> It seemed painted red
[1:44:35] <+RyTYoung> yea
[1:44:35] <BerryliciousDefinition> Ehhh
[1:44:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @ReallyBigRocks funny thing, this is kinda making me want to start horizon zero dawn
[1:44:36] <%Puhff> Yeah apparently this game is the Yakuza of Oregon
[1:44:37] <%Robot_Nixon_> Ah so we play as a crazy person that talks to himself
[1:44:37] <%marsproject> Raw meat
[1:44:37] <DrkJP520> He didn't scream as much as he should have
[1:44:37] <%AzureGale> Probably for the sake of our sanity
[1:44:38] <@CreepyPorpoise> or-gihn
[1:44:38] <thelonechris> It didn't like charred
[1:44:39] <Profmcstevie> He got blowtorched, it should be BLACK in areas
[1:44:40] <%Undenizen> it looked about right.
[1:44:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> I feel like more of it was fucked up than I thought would be
[1:44:41] <+ZipperHands> there should've been fucking bones poking out
[1:44:42] <%Alazull> Like he should have skin sloughing off
[1:44:42] <StaticEntry> no charred flesh
[1:44:43] <@CreepyPorpoise> two syllables >:C
[1:44:43] <Vakojin> It looked pretty bad
[1:44:43] <%chance_h> it take a while to cook
[1:44:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> they were burning one spot on it but the whole thing is red
[1:44:43] <KingOfTheGeats> he moved like it was fine
[1:44:43] <Asblom> psoriasis
[1:44:44] <+ChaosAethr> his arm should be cooked
[1:44:44] <%MechArch> should be charred
[1:44:45] <%walternatorz> shirt is more flammable than arm
[1:44:46] <Sunstalker> It might have been set to low heat, you can regulate it.
[1:44:49] <no123450n> burns looks fine at first
[1:44:49] <%Gogogolem> He should have exposed Bones.
[1:44:49] <heartlesshealer> blowtorch = fucking flesh holes
[1:44:49] <%jorniev> NOT COOKED ENNOUGH
[1:44:49] <Yinlock> it's fine, probably
[1:44:50] <ToneBacas> it should be charred to shit
[1:44:51] <+YabbaTroll> bikers are built different
[1:44:53] <$SGrim> @commanderclaw swamps have always kinda looked like shit, but I get what you mean.
[1:44:54] <bonebagMEL> Better not make it too gory for the kids
[1:44:55] <+admiral_of_crunch> GAWD DAMMIT
[1:44:56] <%WhereIsWill> shouldve looked like brisket laynaWHYTHO
[1:44:56] <$RealThiele> it would be more red and black

[1:48:56] <$KnivesEve> well yeah
[1:48:57] <FutaSnek> AW YEA GOOD REALNESS
[1:48:58] <Psyramics> is it though?
[1:48:59] <%Ozavic> Fair
[1:49:00] <jtsoppy137> not a high bar Kappa
[1:49:01] <masterfire23> more monier
[1:49:01] <+EternalInquisitor> Holy fuck I agree so hard
[1:49:02] <+FoolsArcade> makes sense
[1:49:02] <+RyTYoung> It's very cool a lot of the stuff it does
[1:49:03] <%Puhff> oh wow
[1:49:06] <+brothernerofgc> this is anime last of us 2
[1:49:07] <%Sain_127> we dont want to open that can
[1:49:07] <Riorii> yep the open world part of this game is actually fun af
[1:49:07] <artoflec> its more monier at least
[1:49:08] <iosephe> It's a videogame
[1:49:08] <+admiral_of_crunch> It's okay. TLOU2 was doing tis own thing, like... uh...
[1:49:09] <%Raikouija> And yet we arent getting a sequel
[1:49:10] <Madovir> last of us 1 and 2 look like such a fucking slog
[1:49:11] <%Broken_Sonex> It's better by DEFULT
[1:49:11] <%Raikouija> :P
[1:49:11] <WG101> well, yeah, this is an actual video game
[1:49:12] <BUNS_holt> only good thing about LoU2 is Laura Bailey and Ashley Johnson
[1:49:12] <PartyFavors> Last of Us 2 is more expensive, it's not better
[1:49:13] <+crungleton> This is more game
[1:49:14] <+Scribbles69 > well ya thats open world for you
[1:49:15] <%trustycoyote> i get that. This treats itself like a game
[1:49:16] <%Arek_1> CarlSmile
[1:49:16] <blackjack8182> RIGHT
[1:49:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> There's too much to do
[1:49:16] <Louie_Salmon> All the dialogue and narrative is a massive turnoff so far
[1:49:17] <+evbites> nah it's too much
[1:49:17] <+zee_generate> more moneyer
[1:49:19] <Profmcstevie> It HAS to have things to do, it's a big open world zambo game
[1:49:19] <MoonKing> Days Gone has shittier characters but is a better game. good tradeoff imo
[1:49:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's hard to keep track of everything
[1:49:24] <ApexJaggi> Well yeah, Last of Us 2 was just Last of Us 1 with a worse story.
[1:49:24] <%Ozavic> I'm shitting on it in chat, but it does look alright, maybe a little generic but still fun
[1:49:27] <%Dementedpenguin> So it's more a video game.
[1:49:28] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt I thought you were saying Seeder like they came up with a dumb name for trees too
[1:49:28] <marvel877> this is more videogame-ier
[1:49:28] <PirateMike_> I mean last of us has no gameplay its basically a movie
[1:49:29] <+Exicuren> oh boy, wait until you get traps and decoys, the game is ver dynamic
[1:49:31] <Flame_Water> days gone is refreshing
[1:49:34] <%RaziWraith> @PatStaresAt Omg I can't believe that you think this is better than the literal Game of the Year. KappaHD
[1:49:35] <BigNerdSam> How does Pat get killed by fall damage in every Sony First-Party game?
[1:49:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go get 'em
[1:49:38] <+eanscrale> well hopefully it's the last of that series amirite??
[1:49:44] <balthazar758> it is open world.
[1:49:45] <%Robot_Nixon_> LUL
[1:49:46] <M0untain_wolf> dude
[1:49:47] <+kewlmyc> This is an open world game with TLOU2 wasn't

[1:49:51] <Oxybe> LUL
[1:49:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[1:49:54] <Yleciot> @ozavic I agree with that
[1:49:56] <%jackythefrost> @MoonKing TLOU2 the game AND characters were terrible
[1:49:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Seeder
[1:49:56] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[1:49:57] <+emperri> like pupper
[1:49:58] <CountMeowingtonn> i love how deek will just mumble to himself like a crazy person
[1:50:01] <%Alazull> You know what Cedar is a dumb name for a tree
[1:50:02] <%Deft_Thought> Why's he look like he's hopping
[1:50:04] <SaltyAzteca> thats not hard really lol
[1:50:05] <%Broken_Sonex> Last of Us is a movie, this an actual video game
[1:50:06] <Yinlock> could do without the crafting though
[1:50:07] <%Raikouija> @eanscrale Yeah, Last of Us 3 with Abby is gonna happen isnt it?....
[1:50:08] <%Alazull> Why not Treey McTreeface?
[1:50:09] <endguard> theyre pretty different games arent they though? ones a more linear story based game this seems open world zombies
[1:50:09] <artoflec> i mean this looks like soulless trash just like last of us but i would try this game first
[1:50:10] <$dalmek> *pointing at cows* LOOK A FEEDER
[1:50:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Shoot him in the leg
[1:50:17] <%AzureGale> LIGHT THEM UP
[1:50:17] <Louie_Salmon> Next they'll car cars Guzzers
[1:50:18] <%jorniev> dont you like to go foward until you have to kill some dudes and then walk foward until you have to kill some dudes?
[1:50:19] <BUNS_holt> TREES AREN'T REAL WHAT ARE YOU GUYS EVEN SAYING
[1:50:20] <$KnivesEve> this is a video game, lou2 is trying not to be
[1:50:21] <Oxybe> Them freakers are hidin' in the seeders!
[1:50:24] <+FackinCrazy> honestly if this game wasnt a mix of two the the most overcrowded genres if would have been received much better
[1:50:25] <Asblom> this is like the ubisoft Open world type of game
[1:50:26] <%Raikouija> GLASS EM
[1:50:30] <%TheWinged7> binoclards? thats a new one
[1:50:30] <ApexJaggi> Whoever said humans are more aware of you sneaking lied.
[1:50:31] <burgerbro34> Hey Pat, big fan
[1:50:32] <heybenice> This is a shooter - gun
[1:50:32] <StaticEntry> Binoclard? Kim button

[1:50:46] <yourliteraldog> flacid snake
[1:50:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Think, Mark!!!
[1:50:50] <Louie_Salmon> In this world, guns are Pewers
[1:50:50] <+admiral_of_crunch> Time to kill
[1:50:51] <+eanscrale> @Raikouija Don't give them ideas.
[1:50:53] <jamsbybetty> Oh Hai Mark
[1:50:55] <jtsoppy137> boss you can mark a target by highlighting them with the binocks
[1:50:56] <+democrazyyy> time for sneaky stabby
[1:50:58] <+chiazam> I LOVE LOVE LOVE marking enemies
[1:51:04] <+admiral_of_crunch> These idiots didn't look behind them.
[1:51:08] <BUNS_holt> a fence?dopn't you mean wally blocky?
[1:51:10] <M0untain_wolf> now to kill them
[1:51:10] <Oxybe> knify-wifey or clubsy-wubsey
[1:51:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> DOOM Eternal's Marauder says hello
[1:51:19] <%Raikouija> ooooooooo
[1:51:21] <@commanderclaw> Lure them
[1:51:25] <+emperri> is it
[1:51:28] <jtsoppy137> mabey?
[1:51:32] <friedsquidiot> I honestly like how the game handles interrupted dialogue, even if it‚Äôs kinda jarring
[1:51:33] <%Raikouija> use freakers to murder da men?
[1:51:34] <ProjektRF> Just some guys hanging out
[1:51:39] <Asblom> use rocks
[1:51:51] <iShouldBeAtWorklol> nice
[1:51:54] <%jorniev> imma be real EVER since far cry 3 I LOVE THAT marking mechanic, i don't even care it doesn't make sense or even if it does. i really love marking enemies.
[1:51:59] <StaticEntry> reminds me of using animals to wipe out Far Cry camps
[1:52:05] <Yinlock> somehow marking enemies is way lamer when they're just zombies
[1:52:10] <ApexJaggi> God this motion blur is terrible.
[1:52:14] <%AyotoCorp> Isn't this the E3 demo zone
[1:52:22] <%TIME_PUNCHER> !uptime
[1:52:22] <@Moobot> @TIME_PUNCHER I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 52m.
[1:52:23] <Sunstalker> i can see nr6's pants
[1:52:32] <+admiral_of_crunch> Beware the sniper in the trees
[1:52:34] <eustine> stab stab
[1:52:37] <%trustycoyote> @jorniev don't blame ya. Makes sense
[1:52:39] <+admiral_of_crunch> Quiet man
[1:52:40] <%Raikouija> @jorniev Why can snake mark enemies in MGS5? (Youd expect kojima to explain that)
[1:52:46] <BUNS_holt> @jorniev and yet there's a whole playerbase of people who don't know what the mechanic even is in BF
[1:52:48] <jtsoppy137> Gun
[1:52:51] <Louie_Salmon> @yinlock Because they both don't hold a formation and don't move unpredictability, so there's zero gain from marking them
[1:52:54] <Yinlock> oh nvm they're not zombies they're dudes
[1:53:14] <heybenice> He isn‚Äôt dead just paralyzed tomatoDread
[1:53:18] <PirateMike_> Just some dudes being bros
[1:53:19] <Laecerelius> I was hoping that underbrush behind him was a trap of some kind
[1:53:22] <%Raikouija> wouldnt it take a lot more force to shove a knife through a skull?
[1:53:31] <+emperri> did you ever consider that maybe one of these guys has a dog they really like
[1:53:39] <Asblom> brainstabb effective
[1:53:42] <Riorii> thats fine imo its a game
[1:53:46] <+Pendragwn> how much knife
[1:53:48] <NewWillinium> It also depends on the location of the hit and the angle
[1:53:51] <Yinlock> video game zombie survivalism - murder everyone you see immediately
[1:53:54] <%jorniev> its not impossible to be honest
[1:53:57] <FutaSnek> Fuckin ow
[1:53:58] <jtsoppy137> classic
[1:53:59] <no123450n> temporal area is shallow bone
[1:53:59] <%Puhff> psaBig nife
[1:53:59] <BUNS_holt> YEAH RUN AT HIM
[1:54:00] <yourliteraldog> Shockly Less than you think
[1:54:03] <%jorniev> wait no
[1:54:03] <+emperri> "yeah, run at him"
[1:54:03] <heybenice> Lots of knife
[1:54:04] <Blank9> @emperri yes, but unless the dog has a name I don't think I could possibly feel bad about it
[1:54:04] <DracaenaLeaf> Way to throw the dead guy lol
[1:54:05] <masterfire23> go through the temples
[1:54:07] <pilllowofbees> perfect stealth
[1:54:08] <friedsquidiot> Oregonians are good at stabbing skulls. It‚Äôs just realistic
[1:54:10] <CountMeowingtonn> i remember watching a doctor man say that is actually super hard to penetrate a human skull
[1:54:10] <%jorniev> CROSSBOW
[1:54:11] <ApexJaggi> "Yeah, run at em'!" - Soon to be dead person.
[1:54:12] <Yinlock> deacon what the hell
[1:54:12] <%NeoCre> @raikouija the temple and the base of the skull have much thinner bone
[1:54:13] <+CherteuseKapibara> how much more knife to put though a force?
[1:54:13] <+punchdrunk_donkeybooy> @PatStaresAt Read in Deacon VAs AMA that Deac's crazy muttering is a purposeful choice because in a broken world noone would talk to themself like they are a badass quipster
[1:54:20] <LoneFonte> YEAH
[1:54:21] <+RowenCleric> YEA
[1:54:25] <Profmcstevie> aww the hoomans don't got DA JUICE when you shoot em
[1:54:25] <Yinlock> "GETTING LOW ON AMMO" i say to nobody except my enemies
[1:54:25] <Riorii> great last words there
[1:54:27] <+emperri> the last of THEM
[1:54:27] <thebalticguy1> OOOF
[1:54:28] <CappuccinoGuil> Yup, this game looks AWESOME
[1:54:30] <jtsoppy137> that melee combat is oof
[1:54:31] <FutaSnek> B O M K
[1:54:31] <lloyddboy> some real strong bat laser
[1:54:32] <balthazar758> meet mr batty
[1:54:33] <Louie_Salmon> Last of 'Em
[1:54:33] <$dalmek> oh the Mark you put on them also shows their health?
[1:54:33] <Psyramics> that lady took a lot of bats to the face
[1:54:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you deed et
[1:54:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> sorrey
[1:54:34] <bonebagMEL> it's just like TLOU
[1:54:37] <thebalticguy1> THAT MELEE COMBAT DOESNT LOOK GOOD
[1:54:39] <endguard> gotta be honest that combat has no weight
[1:54:40] <%Arek_1> B O N K
[1:54:40] <%AzureGale> Sorry, people who were planning to murder us
[1:54:41] <%jorniev> YEA-
[1:54:42] <chili_nobeans> phew that's the last of us
[1:54:43] <yourliteraldog> you need an ice pick tbh
[1:54:44] <Yinlock> "musta followed us here" dude they already had a camp set up
[1:54:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> three hit melee combo and that's it
[1:54:58] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah it's not quite the punch lasers
[1:55:04] <PirateMike_> The melee combat is actually pretty sick in this
[1:55:12] <%AzureGale> Can you learn new melee moves
[1:55:14] <+RyTYoung> I think tlou2 gets much better after Seattle day 1, you get a lot more environments where you can play sneaky, get caught, then go back into hiding
[1:55:17] <CappuccinoGuil> The punch lasers????
[1:55:18] <TheFramedWarlock> Punch lasers ?
[1:55:18] <LoneFonte> punch lasors?
[1:55:19] <Vakojin> Killin' bad m'kay
[1:55:19] <+admiral_of_crunch> But the punch lasers look so much better
[1:55:23] <bonebagMEL> really? it looked like that
[1:55:23] <BUNS_holt> but muh cinematic experience in games D:
[1:55:27] <heybenice> Scuffle
[1:55:27] <lol_red_ranger> fucking freddy freakers

[1:55:32] <%MugenSandan> What's a Punch Laser
[1:55:35] <endguard> punch lasers?
[1:55:36] <%TheWinged7> but is it a wucky too?
[1:55:37] <DracaenaLeaf> pretty good
[1:55:43] <CappuccinoGuil> What do you even mean by Punch Lasers, Pat?
[1:55:45] <TheFramedWarlock> The fuck is a punch laser
[1:55:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @yinlock So they followed them at some point AFTER they found the tower and want their claim...

[1:56:16] <+blacksoap65> Cool jank
[1:56:20] <+admiral_of_crunch> Actually, I do like how he mutters. That's some really nice, diegetic tutorializing
[1:56:20] <sweatch0> deacon deez nuts
[1:56:21] <%Dr_DangerPhD> in TLOU when you melee the games programming shoots out lasers to do context sensitive actions in the environment
[1:56:23] <+yourspecialfriend562> Pretty good game I loved it
[1:56:23] <heybenice> Down ya go!
[1:56:27] <%jackythefrost> @RyTYoung It feels like it drags way too long for the very simple gameplay the game has, doesnt help the story is one of the worst revenge stories ever told
[1:56:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the way the character talks to himself really reminds me of horizon ZD
[1:56:28] <%Alazull> He used the Carth words
[1:56:28] <ProjektRF> You know what we need? The human enemies screaming out their friends names everytime someone dies
[1:56:35] <CappuccinoGuil> This..... is turning into a problem
[1:56:41] <jamsbybetty> DOWN YOU GO
[1:56:46] <Yinlock> @ShinobiPhoenix i mean yes it's just video game logic, but you JUST walked out of the base and suddenly anyone with an established camp near you is "following" you
[1:56:54] <SeanPrime22> Punch Laser has to do with the was that your fists in TLoU have little invisible lasers that shoot out a.d scan for enemies and shit
[1:57:07] <CappuccinoGuil> YEYEYEYE SOULS IT UP!
[1:57:10] <TheFramedWarlock> Go for the HEAD pat !
[1:57:11] <Blank9> that roll is neat
[1:57:12] <BUNS_holt> melee for zombies, guns for people
[1:57:13] <%CalderGaming> good jukes
[1:57:15] <TheFramedWarlock> It's a one shot
[1:57:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> huge waste of resources
[1:57:15] <%AncelDeLambert> ... is that a recorder?
[1:57:15] <dj_arashi_rora> crossbows aren't silent, quitter than a gun but they still make noise
[1:57:17] <skyentombment> man, the FREAKERS even do dark souls noises
[1:57:19] <%Dementedpenguin> Deacon is one helluva roller, though
[1:57:19] <DracaenaLeaf> sick jukes
[1:57:20] <+chiazam> CQC
[1:57:23] <Smokin_Fish> to get bullets that quiet the damage seems about right
[1:57:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat just beat a man to death with a flute
[1:57:24] <bonebagMEL> Roll is pretty nuts
[1:57:24] <+traximus_s> that was kinda neat
[1:57:26] <DaCheekyOne> 5 foot 3
[1:57:27] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Souls Gone
[1:57:30] <CappuccinoGuil> @AncelDeLambert it's a stool leg
[1:57:32] <pilllowofbees> they look like the goobers from i am legend
[1:57:34] <RealDurdyDan> @SeanPrime22 Cool lore
[1:57:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> you said it yourself, Meth Zombies
[1:57:41] <Madovir> yike
[1:57:42] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt headshots do kill them pat
[1:57:45] <%templar010> templar010 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Zombies? What a refreshing concept!
[1:57:46] <@SpaceCapnCrone> you just had a gunfight, they're wandering over
[1:57:46] <balthazar758> damn freaks
[1:57:47] <%Raikouija> this is just a dank souls with extra steps
[1:57:50] <Fefe41> Pat is slowly enjoying this game more and more
[1:57:51] <%Broken_Sonex> They're not exactly pushovers. If there's enough of them you're fucked
[1:57:52] <Yinlock> RETURN TO YOUR BIKE
[1:57:55] <BUNS_holt> TLOU BUT ACTUALLY A VIDEO GAME
[1:57:57] <Profmcstevie> Wasn't that the SOLE selling point this game had? Lots of zombies at once?
[1:57:57] <Yinlock> YOUR BICYCLE CALLS FOR YOU
[1:57:58] <+JackedBrain> LuL
[1:58:01] <%Robot_Nixon_> They are fucking everywhere Kreygasm
[1:58:07] <%ItIsSky> this guy also has witcher vision?
[1:58:09] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Would you say there a bit freaky
[1:58:11] <LoneFonte> did you get any skill points yet?
[1:58:12] <PirateMike_> @templar010 THEY NOT ZOMBIES THEY FREAKERS
[1:58:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @yinlock it's not though. you follow someone and then establish a base to observe and eventually overtake them.
[1:58:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why can't you drive that car?!
[1:58:19] <Fefe41> There'll be even more zombos later
[1:58:26] <%Alazull> The more I see of these enemies the harder it is to believe that there are survivors at all
[1:58:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Killing them gives you nothing, isn't it?
[1:58:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Drive that truck and plow them over
[1:58:26] <TheFramedWarlock> Headshots are a one shot kill every time and the crossbow is silent Pat, you're just missing their head and they scream
[1:58:27] <+Pendragwn> Y
[1:58:31] <%Robot_Nixon_> They're like dear, only less annoying
[1:58:34] <Sunstalker> Hey, just realised. You're a bikey man, from a bikey gang.
[1:58:40] <%GalacticaPhanto> They're waiting for you Mr Deacon, in the Bike Zone
[1:58:50] <Yinlock> @ShinobiPhoenix in the like 10 seconds since you got here? no they just had a base here already and deacon's a jackass
[1:58:51] <+emperri> this reminds me of how in MGSV, D-walker was completely silent even in vehicle mode or going around BEEP BOOP TARGET ACQUIRED
[1:58:53] <MechanizedGentleman> Hey Pat you smell! ConcernDoge
[1:58:54] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:58:55] <%TallYoda08> LUL

[1:59:19] <Blank9> head north that'll help surely
[1:59:21] <no123450n> an oregonian wouldnt question the rain
[1:59:24] <+dirkfunk1> this game seems.... bad?
[1:59:32] <haydenfoxy> the Stockholm syndrome setting in
[1:59:33] <blue8moon> "Why is it raining in this place well known for rain?"
[1:59:37] <artoflec> foliage
[1:59:40] <%linSP> is this better than tlou2
[1:59:41] <+Exicuren> btw, he mentions the rain becuase it makes noise and that attracts freakers
[1:59:44] <%Raikouija> FPS GO UP! Game look purty
[1:59:44] <@SSaryn> But gameplay..? Is ok...?
[1:59:45] <%g0atmeal> Why is it always hot? says person in Arizona
[1:59:46] <artoflec> sorry, foiliage
[1:59:50] <mr_saturday93> and this games story isnt shit

[1:59:58] <%Jamejarrs> That classic Oregon Foilage
[1:59:58] <sweatch0> sorry
[1:59:58] <TheFramedWarlock> I didn't mean it as a put down, I just don't want you to avoid using the crossbow/headshots cause of wrong info
[1:59:59] <endguard> tlou2 was a fun game
[2:00:01] <%Broken_Sonex> @linSP It an actual game, so yes
[2:00:02] <Yinlock> @blue8moon "what is this mysterious liquid coming from the sky, damn zombies"
[2:00:03] <Laecerelius> I'll smite you with my kaytana
[2:00:05] <%MelBrooksKA> I'll call you dumb
[2:00:08] <%DukeMoose> yea the foly guys did not fuck around. the wind, the background
[2:00:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @yinlock again, literally they followed Deacon and or Boozer at SOME point, and made a base so they can observe and overtake them. the most basic of tactics
[2:00:12] <%DukeMoose> Welcome to the Suck
[2:00:13] <Profmcstevie> This game did not run great on console last I recall
[2:00:15] <friedsquidiot> It‚Äôs been raining for more than 5 minutes that is weird
[2:00:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Shoulder
[2:00:15] <lbrownthedestroyer> OR is a rainforest , "Why is their rain?" LUL
[2:00:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> Does it help that this game seems to actually be something with people in it
[2:00:19] <DracaenaLeaf> How did they know they were being targeted?
[2:00:19] <haydenfoxy> this does look miles better than PS4 though
[2:00:20] <+yourspecialfriend562> @dirkfunk1 Pretty decent game for 20 bucks I enjoyed for a week and nearly 100% it
[2:00:23] <%saadi90> Last of us 2 got a ps5 patch today
[2:00:26] <+FackinCrazy> tlou2 just got a 60 fps patch

[2:00:35] <Carquar> Is that a table leg/bed post?
[2:00:37] <NewWillinium> So does the Crossbow have a fire drop that's throwing you off?
[2:00:47] <Dunmarkh> @Carquar yes

[2:00:53] <Mirrorcatch> the bike, gotta get the bike
[2:00:53] <%Robot_Nixon_> If this is oregon, it should rain the entire game length
[2:00:54] <+admiral_of_crunch> @friedsquidiot It's either 5 minutes of 500 minutes.
[2:00:55] <BUNS_holt> @FackinCrazy does the 60gps also add a story?
[2:00:55] <+Exicuren> Don't worry, there's an skill that makes crossbows more effective
[2:00:55] <+MackFighters> he's got the bad crossbow so it won't be great yet
[2:01:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat, even if you live your whole life in a place with rain/heat/snow, you'll STILL be mad about it, why are you all surprised? LUL

[2:12:59] <feralspidey> Pat, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOOOW!!!! Biker Culture honestly believes that "Freedom Isn't Free" and that the only way to escape from the hustle and bustle of rural US townships is to ride motorized bicycles and drink at bars.

[2:15:15] <$dalmek> I guess the real #FreakerGang were the friends we made along the way
[2:15:18] <+admiral_of_crunch> Yeah honestly this is how post apocalypse rural cascades would go down. I don't doubt for a second that these folks would set up their communes real quick

[2:17:06] <+emperri> hey what do you think are the odds that the wife isn't dead
[2:17:07] <Louie_Salmon> It's weirdly detailed and also incredibly vague?
[2:17:09] <+RowenCleric> Im gonna put my dead wife gas can into my arm grappler bike
[2:17:11] <geckko12> just don't pay attention to it
[2:17:12] <%Dementedpenguin> map looks like a weird kaiju
[2:17:12] <TheFramedWarlock> Storylines are literally just questlines
[2:17:14] <%jorniev> i wasnt really looking at it
[2:17:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's hard to stay on a single mission
[2:17:16] <ProjektRF> Just open world mission structure
[2:17:18] <%jorniev> damn
[2:17:18] <PartyFavors> @emperri 90 percent

[2:17:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> The game has officially opened up to you now. You get to choose what you wanna do next
[2:17:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> your map looks like Zaboomafoo
[2:17:38] <blue8moon> so did she die from her wounds or the zambies?
[2:17:38] <dj_arashi_rora> that bike looks like trash
[2:17:41] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> PUT POINTS INTO THE CONSTITUTION!
[2:17:46] <DaCheekyOne> Never make menus bright white please
[2:17:50] <M0untain_wolf> Look at this bike
[2:17:50] <Consumanist> i've seen bike before, and that is 100% bike
[2:17:53] <%robo_trunk> the menu was meant to be navigated using the touch pad. that's why it feels weird on PC
[2:17:53] <+notgarza> Monke map
[2:17:55] <%pettydoggerel> If Sarah's dead, I will be SHOCKED
[2:18:04] <Louie_Salmon> Okay chat, does that chance ever reach 100%?
[2:18:05] <+emperri> dont wanna be your monkey wrench
[2:18:10] <Riorii> inventory space is huge
[2:18:12] <+zee_generate> So much white in the skill menus.
[2:18:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Bikers are the most "most", that would be why Trump tried to get some to fight for him
[2:18:27] <+democrazyyy> @PatStaresAt im glad you're enjoying this game somewhat, its not perfect but its actually got some cool stuff in it
[2:18:36] <+admiral_of_crunch> There are BIGGER enemies?
[2:19:08] <%robo_trunk> the game gets much better once you get to know the characters. Main guy is kinda boring but most other people are great

[2:19:50] <+chiazam> FOCUS
[2:19:51] <feralspidey> Heavy Freddy Freakers

[2:20:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt this game screams "its just okay"
[2:20:43] <+ScottishMadJacko> In that tree
[2:20:43] <%cache_22> 4 per tree
[2:20:44] <+democrazyyy> all from ranged tree
[2:20:45] <+Exicuren> overall
[2:20:46] <ProjektRF> They have to be ranged skills
[2:20:47] <Riorii> in the tree
[2:20:49] <Zebroneath> in the tree
[2:20:51] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Yes
[2:20:52] <Laecerelius> Probably per tree
[2:20:52] <%DukeMoose> in the tree
[2:20:53] <+emperri> yikes
[2:20:53] <+admiral_of_crunch> Looks like skills in the tree
[2:20:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ranged only
[2:20:56] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt on the tree
[2:20:56] <ivanmistwalker> Tree
[2:20:56] <LoneFonte> tree
[2:20:57] <CloudCircus> I want to play this joint
[2:20:58] <+democrazyyy> the focus upgrades are very nice to have though
[2:21:00] <skyentombment> @DianaTheAscian serviceable/10
[2:21:04] <akitanito> sounds annoying
[2:21:04] <SomeAsianDood> zombie fiction says zombies can't be called zombies @blastazoid00 its a trope like with the walking dead
[2:21:11] <+ScottishMadJacko> you get early levels pretty quick
[2:21:12] <yourliteraldog> Hell's Angels aren'tthat great
[2:21:13] <jtsoppy137> this DEEEP
[2:21:17] <Laecerelius> I mean how long does it take to get five skill points?
[2:21:19] <DianaTheAscian> @skyentombment yup
[2:21:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Assuming you enjoy crossbow combat
[2:21:21] <TheFramedWarlock> In the tree, but you get more damage on the crossbow much quicker than the skills
[2:21:22] <Fefe41> Time to play for 30 hours
[2:21:24] <%Teyaric> It's "three seasons" of content. And the third one is where it all happens
[2:21:25] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The deeper you go the better. Just like real life!
[2:21:28] <%AncelDeLambert> "Dude, Final Fantasy 13 gets good 20 hours in"
[2:21:28] <Asblom> focus first
[2:21:29] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt chance to retrieve
[2:21:29] <+ScottishMadJacko> Focus is great
[2:21:31] <Tracazoid> FFXIII gets good when you're  a dozen hours in they said
[2:21:34] <eustine> yes
[2:21:38] <+chiazam> Focus
[2:21:39] <Zebroneath> you get a better crossbow and get better bolts
[2:21:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yes?
[2:21:46] <%NeoCre> Focus is ANAZING
[2:21:47] <Consumanist> you get skill points like it's nobody's business in the early stages
[2:21:47] <+ScottishMadJacko> Focus is slowdown time while aiming
[2:21:47] <MoonKing> how many days gone before the game gets good
[2:21:48] <+Riecharus> There are better weapons you find
[2:21:49] <CloudCircus> It‚Äôs not good at the beginning?
[2:21:50] <%cache_22> You get better weapons and upgrades later. Different camps sell different things.
[2:21:51] <%jorniev> probably, it seems like one of those games
[2:21:52] <%DukeMoose> better bow
[2:21:53] <+emperri> I hate the idea that in a zombie apocalypse, people are going to call zombies anything but zombies
[2:21:54] <BigNerdSam> "The game only gets good when you're this deep" is called Stockholm Syndrome.
[2:22:01] <%NeoCre> Yes
[2:22:01] <+emperri> It is such a shitty writing contrivance
[2:22:05] <TheFramedWarlock> Iirc you get it in the story or you buy it somewhere
[2:22:07] <%DukeMoose> focus mode is gud. classic bullet time

[2:54:32] <ergulor> it looked so happy and calm
[2:54:35] <yourliteraldog> This game would be super intresting if what was Boozer and Deeken unlearning their toxic masculinity together and smooching
[2:54:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> That looks great
[2:54:36] <+HeadlessPhoenixGaming> no bugs at all
[2:54:39] <balthazar758> ddog
[2:54:40] <Dunmarkh> It's just like fallout
[2:54:41] <%UnabashedGarbage> Dumb sumbitch got eaten by wolves
[2:54:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> What if I strapped a Engine to my dick, and speed down the highway with no protection other than a fiberglass egg with a skull painting on it
[2:54:41] <skyentombment> He's just stuck like that
[2:54:44] <%Arek_1> LUL
[2:54:44] <+mechslayer71> WHAT DID YOU EAT?
[2:54:46] <eiyuusyndrome> this looks like a fake game thatd be in a tv show
[2:54:46] <%HeadlessPhoenixGaming> HeadlessPhoenixGaming subscribed with Prime. 
[2:54:47] <IminyourBase> i'm sorry lil feller
[2:54:49] <Fefe41> Don't worry about it shut up
[2:54:51] <%AzureGale> Believe it or not a lot of people thought this game was okay
[2:54:53] <+tetraes> @PatStaresAt  did you buy it full price like the director wanted?
[2:54:53] <KitsuneManami> To Eat.... Is to be aLive -mouth smacking chewing-
[2:54:58] <%cvp5127> das gud eatin
[2:54:58] <$QueequegTheater> Is Snake in that box
[2:55:04] <%pokefan9956> so why did people hate this game again?
[2:55:04] <%AzureGale> And yeah, okay is about  where I'd put it too
[2:55:07] <AncyentMarinere> catJAM
[2:55:09] <Meltgar> Wow that was..... a small loot
[2:55:10] <+mechslayer71> THIS AINT NICE, I KNOW
[2:55:11] <%cache_22> I believe the question marks are just random world events that appear from time to time.
[2:55:11] <Siconia> blasta
[2:55:11] <%Dementedpenguin> @cobalt_phoenix_ I mean Pat seems to be enjoying himself so far, so I dunno LUL
[2:55:13] <mrcelab> yes, these ? marks are rarely worth it
[2:55:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> fuck the crossbow
[2:55:24] <IminyourBase> dmg go up
[2:55:27] <%UnabashedGarbage> aaand it's gone
[2:55:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can't get rid of the corssbow, it sucks
[2:55:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> SAwed off and head off go well together
[2:55:34] <%AzureGale> Zombies and open world are huge turn-offs to some people
[2:55:34] <%Bailey__gaming> how is the game 9n pc
[2:55:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Dementedpenguin first thing i see when i get here is a frozen wolf that's dead, so im loving it already too
[2:55:46] <mrcelab> a shotgun, sidearm and a sniper is good combo in this game
[2:55:54] <balthazar758> mah bike
[2:55:54] <mistageeza> what is this a Ride to Hell rip-off?
[2:56:08] <xxshadowxx416> yes
[2:56:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all the bugs and collusion issues with Red Dead Redemption 2 and people are mad at this
[2:56:13] <Psyramics> they probably had to do black magic to make this run at all on PS4, so when it gets some actual power behind it it sings
[2:56:14] <%Bailey__gaming> i never played the ps4 version
[2:56:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> hmmm
[2:56:19] <Profmcstevie> Can you really tell how well optimised a PC port is when you're mister 3090
[2:56:19] <Madovir> the game itself seems kinda iffy but I'm really happy it got a good port, no game deserves a bad port
[2:56:27] <%AzureGale> When do you get the bfg
[2:56:28] <jtsoppy137> they got autos
[2:56:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> hahahaha

[2:56:41] <Jathspuh> WICKED
[2:56:43] <%AzureGale> NUMBERS
[2:56:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will say, I played this on PS5, so maybe there are less issues there
[2:56:48] <T_Sasquatch> we need to put aan end to zombie settings
[2:56:53] <Meltgar> GUN
[2:56:57] <%1buckboom> Yeah looks like it runs pretty smooth!  May wait till it goes on sale.  I've got so many other open world games to get through
[2:56:58] <dio96> I'm pretty sure the PS5 runs this at 4K60.
[2:56:58] <akitanito> you did drive a motorcycle up there
[2:56:59] <%cache_22> It's nice that the game tells you how many enemies there are in the top left.
[2:57:00] <balthazar758> ak, ok
[2:57:03] <Laecerelius> Amazing
[2:57:20] <blue8moon> just go back and get your shotgun
[2:57:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why do we have AK47's in Oregon? Full-Auto ones at that? Is that even legal to have/giving a reason for it to exist in the game world LUL
[2:57:22] <jtsoppy137> oops
[2:57:31] <BlueLunecy> Moonshine you say
[2:57:32] <Profmcstevie> There's an Open World sale May 27th so maybe that'd be a good time to pick this up if it gets discounted
[2:57:33] <xxshadowxx416> he got girls
[2:57:39] <%Bane_Kaikyo> they got some tail?
[2:57:40] <akitanito> you sure

[2:57:59] <$QueequegTheater> @KeiganOfAstora you think you can stop PNW bikers from getting automatic rifles
[2:58:02] <FatherGreyBeard> i like how the guys take more axe hits than the zombies that don't feel pain
[2:58:03] <+chiazam> You had a pistol
[2:58:04] <xxshadowxx416> if they got some tail are they furrys
[2:58:05] <Seth_Tek> you made the right choice pat
[2:58:06] <%ItIsSky> cool you can regain stealth though
[2:58:07] <%pokefan9956> but what if the humans were the real monsters
[2:58:08] <ivanmistwalker> be better with shots?
[2:58:08] <%jackythefrost> @KeiganOfAstora Its 100% legal in rural Oregon yea. Rural area's in the US have barely any gun laws
[2:58:10] <Riorii> molotov also

[2:58:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> @QueequegTheater Let's be real, there aren't an abundance of full-auto rifles out in society. They had to raid somewhere, so they should be AR-15s
[2:59:11] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> @evbites so all games are like dark souls, cool!
[2:59:24] <RealDurdyDan> Smoov

[3:00:51] <%Ranryu692> wow, whoever made this texture mod for Ride to Hell did a great job
[3:00:52] <%jackythefrost> @KeiganOfAstora I went vacationing in rural Oklahoma, they have full auto weapons in abundance

[3:01:17] <+senfood> MACHETE
[3:01:18] <ergulor> Machete
[3:01:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> maybe the game prefers not to see a man stab a woman
[3:01:19] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> so how's the game so far @PatStaresAt ?
[3:01:27] <+democrazyyy> pat's really feelin it

[3:01:52] <%AzureGale> Wow is that that other lady's twin sister
[3:01:52] <deviljhojho_> Actually if you read the lorebook included in the limited edition it specifies that in the Days Gone world stabbing the air in front of someone is lethal
[3:01:52] <+fetrigon> wow
[3:01:54] <T_Sasquatch> thats literally the same npc LUL
[3:01:56] <%pokefan9956> did he lose his balls yet

[3:01:58] <+democrazyyy> right tin the brainstuffs
[3:01:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> She was the same model as the other girl. That's bad...

[3:03:03] <+democrazyyy> dudes in the family guy pose
[3:03:05] <%AzureGale> These folks have REALLY poor hearing
[3:03:16] <ExpressNode> I didn't know you were streaming. My notifications for the past few days have not been working right
[3:03:20] <T_Sasquatch> b l i n d
[3:03:23] <%1buckboom> Still think it was weird for Sony to port this before Ghost of Tsushima or God of War
[3:03:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> The apoclypse doesn't have many Q tips
[3:03:30] <%lilytastic> are those two guys the same guy?
[3:03:40] <vonmaultke> LUL stomp that grass

[3:03:53] <+democrazyyy> look  yall theres just a lot of identical twins in this bandit camp
[3:03:54] <%AzureGale> Why can't you move bodies like in Hitman
[3:03:57] <T_Sasquatch> @1buckboom the fact they are porting it is still astounding
[3:04:00] <akitanito> that's a lot of people
[3:04:01] <Siebersboy> I keep hearing that this game is underrated or terrible and I'm hovering over the buy button
[3:04:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when you really think about it, this is a Rambo Simulator
[3:04:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> OH more goofy Goobers
[3:04:17] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Remember the basic of CQC
[3:04:21] <%AzureGale> No perfect stealth bonus for you
[3:04:24] <Sunstalker> Oh yeah, this is the best. A pat stream of a funk jank game while I'm watching idiots get dunked on by Doc. kinamaCozy
[3:04:26] <+chiazam> MMMmmmm blood splatter
[3:04:31] <Tunamanguy> i think this game was just badly advertised
[3:04:31] <Qsmash_> kinda MGSV-ish stealth system
[3:04:33] <%Rumbutt> "Who's out there?" "Don't worry, I'm a real KNIFE guy"
[3:04:37] <Gorgs7> that moment when you take a shotgun blast to the chest in a video game, and are fine...
[3:04:45] <xxshadowxx416> pat got the high ground
[3:04:46] <+sjay662> @ShinobiPhoenix it's fine. I just like it more because the main character is a fucking crazy person
[3:04:50] <%1buckboom> @T_Sasquatch Nah I'm still hype they're doing it I just want to play Ghosts so bad.  I never got a PS4 since I went super hard on a Gaming PC lol
[3:04:53] <DracaenaLeaf> man did these enemies lose brain cells. Video game ai :/
[3:04:56] <yourliteraldog> Doc is the most Based Game Dev on twitter
[3:05:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> FROM DOWN TOWN
[3:05:09] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> The stealth bonus doesn't seem worth it for how long it takes you to do it
[3:05:10] <Meltgar> They are alerted Pat Kapa
[3:05:14] <Meltgar> * Kappa
[3:05:23] <+UberWolfman> Like the Steam version is at 92% so I guess it was justbecause of how poorly polished it was on PS4?
[3:05:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hit em with the cleaver uppa
[3:05:29] <%NeoCre> Use Molotov
[3:05:29] <%kknutson4> okay

[3:07:05] <xeros720> with the power of bikey knowledge you fixed the generator
[3:07:07] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> redneck magic baby
[3:07:10] <mrcelab> good rifle

[3:07:18] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> shoot her
[3:07:21] <IminyourBase> you literally stabbed like 3 ladies in the brain a minute ago
[3:07:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> Sexist

[3:07:28] <T_Sasquatch> you just snapped a womans neckk
[3:07:28] <%MidnightBurst12> free gun
[3:07:29] <screaminidiot> that gun she dropped is decent
[3:07:29] <ergulor> you do knife women
[3:07:31] <feralspidey> "I ain't got nowhere to go!" Then go.
[3:07:34] <ergulor> gun
[3:07:34] <dots4eyes> She pulled the gun on you first tho
[3:07:35] <%Dementedpenguin> didn't you bash a woman earlier?
[3:07:35] <+waltzqueen> ???
[3:07:37] <deviljhojho_> it was to show he is a merciful big hero man
[3:07:37] <no123450n> suddenly nonviolent towards women after snapping a fem neck
[3:07:38] <+Exicuren> Weapon
[3:07:39] <RaidenRising> frew gun
[3:07:39] <Srthunda> pretty sure one of those guns these guys dropped had bullets
[3:07:40] <%cache_22> That was to establish he doesn't shoot women sometimes.
[3:07:41] <goddamndavid> none of the characters in this game seem very likable
[3:07:43] <CappuccinoGuil> You can get her gun?
[3:07:44] <%TONYOO101> she didnt pick up the real loaded guns on the floor next to her?
[3:07:44] <Reverend_Godshyne> mysterious jogo
[3:07:44] <T_Sasquatch> im not sexist BRO ??
[3:07:46] <akitanito> she's going to become the final villain
[3:07:46] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt she dropped rifle
[3:07:46] <skyentombment> So, in lieu of sex scenes, we get that
[3:07:48] <cubelock555> casual misoginy aww yeah
[3:07:48] <%jorniev> he doesnt SHOOT women STABING IS FINE
[3:07:49] <xanerts> to show how badass he is
[3:07:49] <%Ozavic> That was dumb
[3:07:50] <+Catoclystic> what a gentleman
[3:07:50] <FatherGreyBeard> No women shotted but womens be knifed
[3:07:51] <+Exicuren> New gun
[3:07:52] <Sunstalker> To establish his 'dont kill women' attitude
[3:07:53] <Dunmarkh> hey guys, he shot like 5 women earlier he's not that sexist
[3:07:54] <Qsmash_> to show that he doesn't kill women cause he's a good? guy???
[3:07:54] <+Spaghetto_Godfather> the beginning of the game is jarring for sur
[3:07:54] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> why did she even bother????

[3:08:13] <%lucky_icarus> She dropped a weapon

[3:10:51] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> @Arek_1 I swear that's what it sounded like
[3:11:00] <%pokefan9956> so why does everybody seem to hate this game. seems alright to me
[3:11:05] <+waltzqueen> IM STIIIIIIIIIIILLLL IN A DREAAAAMMMMMMMM
[3:11:10] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Song still kicks ass
[3:11:16] <dio96> Do you think Gief will grow to be larger than Pat one day?
[3:11:27] <%logoth_> @waltzqueen Because the dev is a giant ass
[3:11:31] <+democrazyyy> i feel like most of the hate is just from people being tired of this type of open world gameplay
[3:11:35] <xxshadowxx416> @pokefan9956 it was very buge at launch
[3:11:37] <%Arek_1> SourPls
[3:11:40] <Meltgar> @pokefan9956 I think it's the classy "Sucks on console" because of the performance
[3:11:40] <Fefe41> The game has some jank but it's quite fun and I got my money's worth
[3:11:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @pokefan9956 because the internet loves pointless hate
[3:11:42] <+democrazyyy> doesnt do a lot original but it works better than youd think
[3:11:46] <%senorpapel> Cheer500 hey pat, i saw you learning about the horrors of current wow so i wanted to share another one. At the start of bfa, to be a viable tank as a warrior, you needed a specific piece of gear since the trait on it made your aoes have bleed and you could keep threat. This trait was only on 4 pieces of gear in the whole game. It was so bad trying to tank as warrior that i just stopped doing dungeons and realized there was nothing else to do in game.
[3:11:48] <Meltgar> Oh right, the bugs
[3:11:48] <%Undenizen> @pokefan9956 it seems incredibly generic to me? It's like someone looked at Last of Us and said "Wow, this is great, but what if I made it about a brown haired white guy instead?"
[3:11:54] <%Broken_Sonex> Dev was an asshole and got fired for it
[3:12:11] <%CalderGaming> ***
[3:12:22] <Reverend_Godshyne> I enjoyed it. Bit of a rough start but gets more fun to play, and the plot picks up once you reach the 3rd camp. Deacon also grew on me, both the character and the VA's performance
[3:12:23] <Parapattern> @pokefan9956 That's just it. It's 'alright'.
[3:12:30] <%logoth_> oh wow he got fired?
[3:12:31] <+sjay662> The games biggest sin people hate about it is that "it's not original"
[3:12:40] <+sjay662> which I mean, sure... but the game is totally fine
[3:12:42] <Qsmash_> I don't know how you sell this game. It's a gritty third-person shooter, with stealth mechanics, and zombies. You probably played something like this before.
[3:12:50] <%CalderGaming> Unoriginal Sin
[3:13:02] <+democrazyyy> i think sam witwer's voice acting for deacon is what really sells me on this game
[3:13:07] <%thotbane> I just popped in, is the game still shit?
[3:13:10] <frostyjay3> I was NOT expecting Days Gone to be streamed this week tbh.
[3:13:16] <%Undenizen> don't get me wrong. if a game's well made it's well made. but if the subject matter is something i've seen a thousand times before, that's a hard sell.
[3:13:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @Qsmash_ bikes and Deacon, honestly.
[3:13:29] <+sjay662> Yeah, Sam Witwer elevates this game. He is an unhinged maniac and it's great
[3:13:32] <+democrazyyy> what also sold me was the zombie hordes, though pat hasnt run across one yet
[3:13:34] <frostyjay3> @thotbane it‚Äôs nothing less than shit
[3:13:37] <usuallysleepy> this game has a pretty rough intro, but its also not like the payoff is mindblowing either
[3:13:43] <Reverend_Godshyne> His delivery is weird sometimes but I suspect it's because of the direction he received
[3:13:47] <+sjay662> it's basically playing Walker from Spec Ops the line at the end of that game for the whole game
[3:13:52] <ForeignEnglish00> Imma Number!
[3:14:10] <+waltzqueen> @frostyjay3 i thought you were gonna say "I wasnt expecting Days gone to be this WEAK"
[3:14:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I rather like Sam Witwer in most things, even Being Human
[3:14:17] <%TheLakinessMonster> @sjay662 Whenever I have seen Sam Witwer, it's always a great time. Loved him as Darth Maul in the Clone Wars.
[3:14:28] <%thotbane> @Undenizen IIRC wasnt this game first announced a long time ago, before zombie apocalypse "we're the real monsters" stuff wasn't quite* fully beaten to death yet
[3:14:33] <+sjay662> He is so fucking good as Darth Maul
[3:14:33] <+beatswithkev> @ShinobiPhoenix Same
[3:14:50] <+democrazyyy> it was announced before it was beaten to death, then released after it was lmao
[3:14:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @thelakinessmonster he's also Palpatine, but I knew him as Doomsday
[3:15:03] <+sjay662> Salty as fuck no one saw Solo, because we could have gotten Star Wars underworld films where Maul is a crime boss.
[3:15:18] <+sjay662> Solo is like Days Gone. It's fine
[3:15:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> But Solo was bad?
[3:15:34] <+democrazyyy> if only it wasnt
[3:15:37] <%Monkeyweed21> @KeiganOfAstora exactly
[3:15:40] <%pokefan9956> days gone is the Han solo of video games
[3:15:49] <%transporterthesequel> Oh my god he DID decide to play days gone
[3:15:50] <+democrazyyy> o fuck
[3:15:52] <+democrazyyy> apt
[3:16:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> @transporterthesequel Little late there buddy LUL
[3:16:19] <%Undenizen> Don't worry. Disney will get around to every conceivable star wars avenue eventually. that cash cow gonna get milked to death.
[3:16:23] <%AzureGale> This is a long bathroom break
[3:16:24] <+waltzqueen> all the sanke eatering has me sad pat hasn't streamed MGS yet
[3:16:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> speaking of, I can't believe CW had the balls to do Doomsday in a show where Superman isn't Superman yet
[3:16:33] <CappuccinoGuil> I honestly think this game looks like a lot of fun
[3:16:34] <%Gondab> Days Gone is the Rip Cheato of games.
[3:16:38] <+democrazyyy> im surprised hes enjoying himself honestly, but pleasantly so
[3:16:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> @ShinobiPhoenix Wait they did what? When?
[3:17:03] <Profmcstevie> Pat has goblins, it's no surprise he likes this game
[3:17:06] <+sjay662> @ShinobiPhoenix they killed Superman in his second movie in their cinematic universe
[3:17:14] <%TheLakinessMonster> @ShinobiPhoenix Sick, didn't know he did Palp in lego.

[3:31:59] <+HLG_Diego> Wait what city doesn‚Äôt have trees now I‚Äôm curious
[3:32:01] <+Daedalus119> @ExpressNode trees are significantly more common than snow probly
[3:32:15] <%thotbane> Cities have trees. Shitty ones but still trees
[3:32:18] <vilecrois> @BoxNavy the anti-vaxxers
[3:32:18] <%crimsong0ddess> I live in Compton, ca and we have trees
[3:32:27] <TheGammaBear> The PS4 version had tons of issues
[3:32:29] <%i_chevalier> he said it twice
[3:32:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> terrible cities run by terrible people probably lack in trees
[3:32:34] <SilverRoddo> The feel of completed quest
[3:32:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Go to the storylines screen to see your %
[3:32:45] <+TallPixels> hope you bought this at full price or else
[3:32:46] <%AzureGale> HICCUP
[3:32:47] <%thotbane> in the cut where the wood at
[3:32:57] <Profmcstevie> See, now that hiccup is also pretty alien soundin
[3:33:08] <%Taisuru> psaGoblin *HRAAAEUGH*
[3:33:11] <SomeAsianDood> Cities in the Middle East probably don't have a ton of trees. Unless you're at one of those oil hotels
[3:33:13] <%MaxeusTheFirst> MaxeusTheFirst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Just got out of the military and moved into an apartment which beats the barracks any day, now to watch my favorite streamer!
[3:33:31] <%thedankestmeeme> train on the water boat on a track!
[3:33:35] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> All that was missing is this game let you whistle and your bike just rides into your location like a horse LUL
[3:33:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> not cities I have been though. NYC, Chicago, Boston, Berlin, Vienna, London, San Francisco, D√ºsseldorf , all have trees
[3:33:42] <+democrazyyy> crossbow bolts for days (gone)
[3:33:50] <%i_chevalier> @maxeusthefirst Congratulations.  I hope you all the best.
[3:33:54] <%BoxNavy> good words
[3:34:04] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> escape grabs sounds good
[3:34:10] <kiwicoffin> less sway?
[3:34:17] <TheGammaBear> Yes, that's what it means
[3:34:18] <+tuchpi> @SomeAsianDood wtf LUL
[3:34:18] <%BoxNavy> thats a weird ass sentence
[3:34:26] <TheGammaBear> You'll have a tighter crosshair while moving
[3:34:31] <%MaxeusTheFirst> @EynosStyles Thanks man!
[3:34:33] <+Exicuren> Ys, better am while moving
[3:34:33] <%cache_22> I would do the repair melee skill to make use of extra scrap.
[3:34:35] <Zebroneath> spread won't increase too much while moving during aiming
[3:34:38] <+Exicuren> aim*
[3:34:40] <SilverRoddo> CoD Stalker perk
[3:34:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> make Melee weapons absorb metal scrap
[3:34:42] <%i_chevalier> @jetstreamlover_ryocan only if it clips through builds to get to you
[3:34:53] <+TallPixels> fax
[3:34:56] <+paladinstarbuster> *"Move, and aim"
[3:35:04] <%AzureGale> Repair wooden bats with your metal scrap
[3:35:06] <+Exicuren> Field repairs is good
[3:35:06] <Dunmarkh> vicious cycle sounds cool
[3:35:13] <%hrbeck_> god, Praetorium takes so fucking long
[3:35:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you often pass up scrap, so you need a use for scrap
[3:35:31] <+democrazyyy> fuck consumables, hoard everything
[3:35:31] <%BoxNavy> Juice U
[3:35:32] <%BoxNavy> p
[3:35:42] <%BoxNavy> smack a douche
[3:35:43] <SomeAsianDood> @SomeAsianDood Am I wrong though? The resort hotels funded by oil money are probably one of the few places in the urban settings with trees
[3:35:56] <SomeAsianDood> Though there's probably quite a bit of trees outside
[3:35:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Another skill point??
[3:35:58] <TheGammaBear> I think I used a stamina cocktail like once the entire game?
[3:36:12] <%i_chevalier> miss the opportunity to use duck tape noises in field repairs
[3:36:18] <Manjove> how are you liking Mr. Force Unleashed man in this zombo game?
[3:36:28] <CloudCircus> This reminds me of Dead Rising
[3:36:39] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> I'm assuming this is like breath of the wild where they make you constantly picking and changing weapons
[3:36:43] <+Totally_Not_Toby> #freakergang
[3:36:46] <Reverend_Godshyne> yes
[3:36:46] <%AzureGale> SMASH THE BIKE

[3:37:37] <%Aeoneth> Yes
[3:37:37] <jtsoppy137> that game was good
[3:37:38] <vile_brand> i think i did
[3:37:39] <Zebroneath> I've played Mad Max
[3:37:39] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> ye
[3:37:39] <feralspidey> yes a litt
[3:37:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> yea.....
[3:37:40] <WiredBall> it was pretty ok
[3:37:40] <Psyramics> I have had that on my ps4 for years and have yet to touch it
[3:37:40] <+RenoDeGeneric> Yes
[3:37:41] <masterfire23> ye it was sick
[3:37:41] <deviljhojho_> Yeah it was real solid
[3:37:42] <feralspidey> a little
[3:37:45] <%cache_22> I own Mad Max but have not played it. Should I play it?
[3:37:45] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> yeh
[3:37:45] <Vakojin> It's the same kind of janky but charming
[3:37:46] <%BoxNavy> is this weirdly excellent?
[3:37:46] <+abatage> yeah Mad Max was dope
[3:37:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have friends who love that game
[3:37:48] <%Lion_kun> it was rpetty good
[3:37:48] <%Aeoneth> It was super good
[3:37:48] <blackjack8182> Yes
[3:37:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> It was decent but too monotonous
[3:37:49] <T_Sasquatch> No. I heard its decent
[3:37:49] <+Tragosavich> So how the game?  It seems pretty chill
[3:37:50] <vile_brand> the one matt and woolie did a video for?
[3:37:50] <vilecrois> No trees on that one
[3:37:50] <+McDerpus> it was good, wouldn't say excellent
[3:37:52] <+paladinstarbuster> lil bit
[3:37:54] <yourliteraldog> No but watched someone else it looked actually decent
[3:37:55] <deviljhojho_> thats what i was thinking....
[3:37:55] <+Gespens> REST IN PEACE KENTARO MIURA NotLikeThis
[3:37:55] <Link232> Yeah it was basically the best 7.5 game ever
[3:37:56] <%radregice> i was a little interested in it but mgsv came out at the time so
[3:37:56] <leinadtonu> I really enjoyed it
[3:37:56] <+EternalInquisitor> I did a full fucking LP of it, great game.
[3:37:56] <+NerevaRising> cool game but super repetitive after a while
[3:37:57] <Laecerelius> Oh yeah I have that on PS4 I think.  I need to play it some time.
[3:37:58] <+TallPixels> It's the same feeling i swear
[3:38:02] <Reverend_Godshyne> It got repetitive but the vehicle stuff was good
[3:38:02] <+Cinnerennic> it dragged bad tho after the 3rd area opens up... this is kinda the opposite imo
[3:38:02] <Sunstalker> I played a bit and stopped. But yeah, pat, Mad Max. That's why Doc was all over this game
[3:38:04] <tengel66> yes. beat it a few times
[3:38:11] <+TallPixels> this game is WAY too long btw
[3:38:13] <%Ynkubus_> Yeah it was really good bar some bits here or there
[3:38:17] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:38:18] <+McDerpus> it used batman arkham combat, which sucks
[3:38:20] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> This does look like a great game to grab on a sale
[3:38:21] <+BIumen> yo we god of war?
[3:38:23] <%thotbane> it looked good but, ehhh
[3:38:24] <%radregice> bad
[3:38:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Cave of spooks
