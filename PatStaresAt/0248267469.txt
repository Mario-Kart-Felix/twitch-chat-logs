[0:15:02] <TyrantBelial> WHY AREN'T YOU USIONG BLAZE
[0:15:02] <BTap> but the Tigris Prime
[0:15:03] <+Doctor_Scoots> As a reminder, elemental damage is calculated differently
[0:15:03] <aliggg321> Who cares guys, potatoes aren't /that/ hard to gain over time.
[0:15:03] <DisGuyOvahEre> they call it a shot gun but im pretty sure its just a harpoon
[0:15:05] <AC9_Nineball> Ammo Stock, the strongest shotgun mod
[0:15:06] <+migofrompluto> Primed Point Blank
[0:15:07] <Worldbrand> Hek's multishot augment makes it competitive with the vaykor hek anyway.
[0:15:09] <%Lordgale119> tigris and galatine prime are high level, guys

[0:56:57] <%breakfastmegapowers> When are you going to Cybertron?
[0:56:59] <+valkuma> i feel like the Frame being a Frame was really heavily alluded to. Like its called warFRAME and maroo calls you tinSUITS and that one boss says "beneath that suit there is flesh" etc
[0:57:00] <Cobra743> WHAAAM, ZOOOM, STRAIGHT TO THE MOON!!!!!
[0:57:01] <TropicalPsychosis> the twin queeves
[0:57:01] <deviljhojho94> !UPTIME
[0:57:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 57m 10s.
[0:57:01] <Worldbrand> oh yeah it really is

[0:57:12] <Shinmaddrox> Tone does a 900 mctwist.
[0:57:13] <Rogue657> @OhioNitsud this is rhino prime not his original
[0:57:16] <Fien111> It's like this game is about 6-7 years old or something
[0:57:21] <OhioNitsud> ohhh
[0:57:22] <+HRDSalami654> Get ready for DE's wild ride, Pat.
[0:57:22] <+gozzojt27> wonder if he will have time for chains of harrow tonight...

[0:57:27] <Estuko> @Fien111 5-6
[0:57:28] <tangoragahn> Will Pat be strong enough to defeat Spacedad? Or is stream at risk?
[0:57:29] <HealingMind> @valkuma not to mention Vor's Prize showed that Vor like 80% nailed what Tenno were
[0:57:33] <CrimsonCore90> @migofrompluto damn I'm only 60 ish
[0:57:46] <Volkrotia> Best combo set
[0:57:48] <deviljhojho94> Patricio "One man Grinnir holocaust" O'boivin
[0:57:55] <TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 It USED to be good, and that's enough! But seriously, since the bankruptcy, it's only been going up, but I'll admit, bankruptcy is the lowest bar to start from. I blame literally every mayor and governor who would kick the budget can down the road expecting the car money to keep it going. Primarily Republicans.
[0:57:56] <NemokillerV> @gozzojt27 probably not since the war within is sort of long
[0:58:03] <+migofrompluto> About 100 hours in you should get getting to Natah and The Second Dream

[1:02:40] <%YabbaTroll> @AngriestPat YOU CAN REMOVE CYST
[1:02:40] <%shin_garbage> better yet you can literally clone yourself
[1:02:40] <%TaifuDragon> DEAL WITH THE CYST PLEASE
[1:02:41] <tierney12> someone should stream wrestlemania and pretend they're playing 2k18 Kappa
[1:02:43] <Estuko> Get Clem Clones -> Clem Harem -> Perfect Army
[1:02:51] <RevenTheLight> DEAL WITH THE CYST PLEASE!

[1:04:15] <BlindGato> Worm is too pure for this world
[1:04:16] <TheOnlyStrayCat> He isn't paying attention to chat much, kids. He's discovering on his own.

[1:05:45] <MonsieurHedge> HE EMERGES
[1:05:45] <+ThePayphone> there comes a time in every warframe players life where you have to make the transition from tanking to killing enemies faster than they can kill you

[1:06:41] <+nramsey8> That gun is too big
[1:06:42] <TheSpartanThief> It's really just Archwing limbo though
[1:06:45] <CptHarlok> @johnchikr Chroma was admittedly very expensive to set up properly. Once you did though, the damage was insane, and he was utterly unkillable.
[1:06:46] <ArrogantPrimate> He's got more Archwing stuff than I do with 900 hours :D
[1:06:48] <El_Samio> this... fucking mission
[1:06:52] <MattPlainview> Has to be purple? Oh, okay, Woolie..

[1:08:17] <%breakfastmegapowers> I expect Pure Platinums from a pro like Pat
[1:08:24] <akira_chong> I'm watching this in bed in a dark room with a tall glass of water. This is such a relaxing way to spend a Sunday evening.

[1:24:25] <feuddude> Coming up with your own lore is the true endgame
[1:24:27] <+TerryTheTurret> Never go full Pat rooDerp
[1:24:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Watch out for the giant Purple People Eater
[1:24:29] <+HRDSalami654> I can't wait for his reaction to what happens here though.
[1:24:29] <+Punchasaur> they hang out with joseph seed
[1:24:33] <Volkrotia> Is this the Genocide run?
[1:24:40] <sassyquatch963> they're grineer
[1:24:40] <zfenty> pat lore is best wrong lore
[1:24:41] <deviljhojho94> sure
[1:24:42] <$nitronLVIII> Ignore the haters Pat you can get as much lore wrong as you want to
[1:24:43] <+JavaManJoJo> Pat this hurts
[1:24:43] <deviljhojho94> why not
[1:24:43] <cizal11> he went all the way around to get like 5 feet away from where he was
[1:24:44] <tierney12> @Volkrotia yes
[1:24:44] <+HRDSalami654> Stop Pat.
[1:24:44] <%MrBorisMakarov> It's getting stronger
[1:24:46] <Innocuous_Goat> Please stop
[1:24:47] <+Valison> I wonder if pat's gout gives him DSP tier problem solving
[1:24:47] <Louie_Salmon> So many new people, must be because of Pat talking about this on the podcast
[1:24:48] <@thenefftw> I love how wrong Pat s
[1:24:49] <Zombrocom> Oh pat, you so silly
[1:24:50] <Goergorion> Crazy Talk!
[1:24:52] <deviljhojho94> pat is growing powerful
[1:24:54] <+昼寝の神様> Pat's stand too stronk.
[1:24:55] <0078thunder> ????
[1:24:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> kinda
[1:24:55] <not_machoman> I hope plague is here to text him that he's real dumb
[1:24:56] <+HRDSalami654> Crazy Talk Requiem.
[1:24:58] <sassyquatch963> he's so close
[1:24:59] <KingOfTheGeats> ehhh
[1:25:01] <+CJett92> Man Pat, you are NAILING these predictions
[1:25:01] <deviljhojho94> 🤔 BIG THINKINGS 🤔
[1:25:02] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Okay that bit isn't exactly wrong
[1:25:02] <akira_chong> NOW HE'S GETTING IT
[1:25:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> closer than anything else
[1:25:03] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> i think it'd be cooler if the queens were like insect queens, like naked mole rats
[1:25:03] <%shin_garbage> Weren't the grineer clone slaves or some shit that were not meant to live that long, thus why they're all fucked up?
[1:25:05] <Volkrotia> Thats cool everytime i see it
[1:25:05] <Tucker0603> PAT YOUR LORE GUESSING IS GETTING DUMBER
[1:25:07] <glacialbluebird> Someone donate to fix this man's blindness
[1:25:11] <%mordred_t> Okay, Crazy Talk has reversed polarities.
[1:25:11] <+itsthatasianboy> I'm starting to think Pat's spoiling the lore
[1:25:13] <KingOfTheGeats> getting there Pat
[1:25:16] <+gucci_sama> guys chill
[1:25:16] <+itsthatasianboy> everything's been correct
[1:25:20] <cizal11> he really really isn't
[1:25:20] <DigbyMayor> This is bafflingly wrong
[1:25:22] <El_Samio> because they are witches
[1:25:24] <acridPaladin> lol no
[1:25:26] <RevenTheLight> Honestly, he has more interesting guesses then I did while running through this
[1:25:28] <dpython> @shin_garbage gene deterioration
[1:25:32] <tierney12> @itsthatasianboy pat's making his own lore LUL
[1:25:33] <fattness132> Im so excited for whats coming
[1:25:33] <+ruddyredbone> fuck actually finding all the kura to read the queens lore
[1:25:33] <%legendfather_of_giants> thats not stealth pat
[1:25:38] <+itsthatasianboy> I'd play Pat's Warframe
[1:25:40] <sassyquatch963> god the music in this quest is so good! how did i not notice before!
[1:25:42] <%shin_garbage> gotcha
[1:25:42] <akira_chong> @RevenTheLight Same here.
[1:25:46] <DasZeleot> Pat consistently gets worse at lore guessing the longer he plays the game
[1:25:46] <deviljhojho94> Guys what if the grineer queens are two halves of lotus 🤔 🤔
[1:25:48] <El_Samio> BIG SPOILS FOR BIG BOIS
[1:25:49] <+TootPirate> he's not even to the good part
[1:25:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> They're actually virus ghosts
[1:26:00] <cizal11> that is true
[1:26:00] <%YabbaTroll> LETS

[1:26:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> hunger is the best spice
[1:26:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> scientifically proven that absense makes the heart grow more distant
[1:26:08] <+AntithesisEK> I'm apprehensive of the truth of that

[1:34:05] <Jaxterpeace> the only good thing ordis does is throw my MR fodder kubrows out the airlock
[1:34:06] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Pat's feelings about the late level quests remind me of how I feel about the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. It's amazing for people who've watched both seasons of the series. But if you don't watch both seasons, there's nothing special. And like Warframe, I can't in good conscience recommend the show.

[2:39:09] <Estuko> Pat you're going to make me throw up

[2:39:13] <Bman1991> MOT
[2:39:14] <alebeard> also top tier defense farmer.
[2:39:15] <El_Samio> VOID SURVIVAL WITH NEKROS + HYDROID
[2:39:15] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Taranis LUL
[2:39:19] <El_Samio> ffs
[2:39:19] <Bman1991> lol
[2:39:21] <%InkblotBlues> Quit pushing Mot!
[2:39:22] <smittenByAntsInPants> STILL NO NEKROS
[2:39:22] <PsychedelicSnake> a argon
[2:39:22] <Bman1991> FFS
[2:39:22] <prismaticsnake> No argonian crystals here
[2:39:25] <Estuko> taxi bois
[2:39:25] <Rogue657> @dtogo particularly good for low lv, or venom builds for halving everything's HP
[2:39:26] <+OblivionSword1> just do the early void defense
[2:39:27] <firesonicz> any play in the void
[2:39:28] <Maverick2736> Guys we need to see him react to the living quarters on stream. TOP. PRIORITY.
[2:39:29] <Fabric_tester> Void exterminate
[2:39:30] <ohmygodiamonfire> JUST BUY ONE YOU HAVE LIKE A MILLON PLAT
[2:39:33] <cizal11> it does not
[2:39:36] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat Your clanmates are fucking with you
[2:39:38] <El_Samio> WHY ARE THEY DOING DEFENCE
[2:39:39] <+MikoNoPants> There are Argon Crystals always in the void
[2:39:39] <%Wrashis> i dont know why pat would let saryn in his group when he was clearly the cause of him spending money on hats
[2:39:39] <Rogue657> @ohmygodiamonfire you can't buy argon crystals my dude
[2:39:39] <DigbyMayor> Do the first fucking good mission
[2:39:40] <ChatNinja> Seperate thing
[2:39:41] <alebeard> ez mode
[2:39:42] <%InkblotBlues> Nooooo
[2:39:45] <Bman1991> this gunna be slow
[2:39:46] <+d00msdaydan> oh god he still hasn't turned off his boychild callouts
[2:39:46] <+Nthenorm> just buy one with your free money
[2:39:47] <DigbyMayor> *void
[2:39:48] <+Saltima> no...
[2:39:48] <+ruddyredbone> what
[2:39:49] <+dtogo> Is Saryn good against all factions?
[2:39:50] <RevenTheLight> It's the first one with execution, you can get like 1+
[2:39:50] <thelaxinator> Isn't argon chemically inert and non-reactive? what could it possibly be used for?
[2:39:51] <zfenty> you can get them from here but it is random
[2:39:52] <cizal11> you left survival for a defense?
[2:39:53] <+MikoNoPants> Argon can be a reward for defense
[2:39:55] <Rogue657> @Nthenorm you literally cannot buy argon crystals
[2:39:55] <Zbljuv> fucking just do capture you dumb fucks
[2:39:56] <+MajorCrasher> ALL VOID HAS ARGON
[2:39:56] <%InkblotBlues> Just do a capture mission or something
[2:39:57] <El_Samio> someone is gonna fire the lasers and score a PKILL
[2:40:00] <%Aldurin_> @AngriestPat do a capture or exterminate, the argon pickup containers don't spawn on defense
[2:40:01] <deanbees> Wait til he learns the mote amp is the WORST weapon ever.
[2:40:04] <+Saltima> @AngriestPat NOW you are on the wrong level
[2:40:04] <$Desmond_Vakarian> Saryn is bae
[2:40:04] <PsychedelicSnake> @AngriestPat You should do both Octavia's Anthem and Chains of Harrow on stream. The former has a sort of follow-up to Second Dream and the latter continues on that weird eye stuff from the War Within.
[2:40:12] <+HelloImTom08> defence? survival was better D:
[2:40:12] <+kuervojones> Pat you gotta level the amp too
[2:40:13] <%legendfather_of_giants> @thelaxinator its Argon from Space Hell
[2:40:13] <tangoragahn> F U T U R E
[2:40:18] <urs0jb> it is actually easier to find argon crystal on lockers and crates, so any extermination or capture would be better
[2:40:22] <dpython> Capture is fastest to be honest
[2:40:29] <+MikoNoPants> Argon can be a defense reward but Survival, Capture or Exterminate are the best for Argon Crystals
[2:40:31] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> You can't put rifle mods on shotguns
[2:40:32] <+Wukku> Its easier to find argon in deposits than on drops
[2:40:33] <Bman1991> he has the zenurik right? i dont think he activated it///
[2:40:34] <+MajorCrasher> you have to equip the riven
[2:40:34] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat you need to equip the mod pat
[2:40:37] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat you need to equip the riven mod on a rifle (not a shotgun) for the challenge to count
[2:40:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Level the amp
[2:40:46] <El_Samio> but is it a PILFDROID?
[2:40:49] <El_Samio> NOT AUTOMATICALLY
[2:40:49] <acridPaladin> rifle rivens can only be equip to a rifle. it doesnt care what weapin is used yo unlock it tho. as long as its equip
[2:40:50] <cizal11> STALKER
[2:40:51] <zfenty> some nekros would help
[2:40:51] <DasZeleot> s l a p p y b o i
[2:40:51] <jex771> HEE HEE
[2:40:52] <RevenTheLight> Okay, can someone explain why Defense is used tor crystals? I usually get mine in Extermination
[2:40:53] <dpython> ARGON
[2:40:54] <smittenByAntsInPants> THERE IT IS
[2:40:55] <El_Samio> GET THE CRYSTAL
[2:40:56] <$Bncbck> ARGON
[2:40:58] <Shinmaddrox> Argon
[2:40:59] <%khalcipher> PAT
[2:41:01] <+tylernator2777> THERE IT IS
[2:41:01] <cizal11> ARGON
[2:41:02] <dpython> GET THE CRYSTAL
[2:41:03] <Ichigo247> he is learning
[2:41:03] <Inebriateddonut> Pat geddit
[2:41:03] <El_Samio> IT'S TAGGED, JUST FOR YOU
[2:41:04] <sunny935> @AngriestPat just use space time wizard to cheese that riven mod
[2:41:06] <+tylernator2777> WE DID IT BOYS
[2:41:11] <El_Samio> YOU LUCKY FUCK
[2:41:11] <Goergorion> He will spoil the Mom thing before Harrow D:
[2:41:12] <+WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Mods should notify Pat once this session is complete that their game is currently listed as "Public".
[2:41:14] <tierney12> ARGON PogChamp
[2:41:15] <%Mornaka> you...did it
[2:41:16] <anon_1307> YEYEYEYE
[2:41:16] <junipxr> PogChamp ARGON
[2:41:16] <DasZeleot> WE DID IT
[2:41:16] <thelaxinator> that was fast
[2:41:17] <+tylernator2777> LOCAL PAT IS FUCKING BLIND
[2:41:20] <InsomniacPersona> amazing
[2:41:21] <Matermind0> WE DID IT
[2:41:22] <LethalSquatch> GG
[2:41:24] <Bman1991> DEAD
[2:41:25] <Bman1991> lol
[2:41:26] <+valkuma> holy hell what is the range on that rhino stomp
[2:41:28] <+MikoNoPants> Syndicate Eximus enemies dropped him Argon
[2:41:28] <%Confused_4K> WE DO IT
[2:41:32] <+Wukku> @Goergorion Can't do mom until after harrow
[2:41:36] <thelaxinator> zero to argon crystal in about 3 minutes
[2:41:37] <Rogue657> @valkuma that looks like 145% or so
[2:41:37] <bear_breaker20> is the void the best place to farm mods?
[2:41:38] <TheHornyPriest> What MR is he?
[2:41:38] <Ichigo247> probably max range
[2:41:41] <Rogue657> @valkuma not particularly high
[2:41:42] <Estuko> Harrow then mom.
[2:41:42] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> 9
[2:41:43] <+MikoNoPants> Eximus enemies in the void Drop Argon
[2:41:43] <El_Samio> new loka IS the worst
[2:41:44] <RevenTheLight> oh they just drop. nice
[2:41:46] <iusetheinternet> pat is currently mr9
[2:41:46] <SunsetJack> They died lol
[2:41:51] <$DeathmanJones> I figured he would like New Loka since he likes Earth so much
[2:41:53] <deanbees> It was just a Stretch if I recall
[2:41:55] <+Nephthyz> What's wrong with New Loka?
[2:41:55] <+DZiffer> New Loca is so pissy about everything
[2:41:59] <DigbyMayor> Don't piss off loka
[2:42:02] <TheHornyPriest> Oh shit that's actually pretty good ty for telling me
[2:42:05] <El_Samio> new loka are luddites in space age
[2:42:06] <Bman1991> his zenurik isnt activated
[2:42:11] <Ichigo247> loka is a cult and i love them
[2:42:12] <lab990> stupid loka, just shitty space hippies
[2:42:13] <+tylernator2777> Perrin best, no I will NOT change my mind
[2:42:15] <Kratok> Are you kidding me? Mysticism hippies that are completely wrong about everything?
[2:42:19] <Nobrev> !uptime
[2:42:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 42m 28s.
[2:42:19] <tierney12> tbf the sancti tigris is god tier - 1
[2:42:20] <%shin_garbage> Red Veil a best
[2:42:21] <El_Samio> suda and steel meridian are the best
[2:42:23] <AC9_Nineball> @bear_breaker20 Doing the obstacle courses can get you rare mods
[2:42:23] <thelaxinator> So if you just pop out spoiler boi in populated areas do you get banned?
[2:42:27] <deanbees> @Bman1991 He didn't upgrade it.
[2:42:30] <+MrChapwhit> Focus ability Matt
[2:42:30] <%shin_garbage> purge the inferior
[2:42:32] <+Ciphris> new loka: fuck orokin tech they need to be destroyed
[2:42:35] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> That's a focus ability, inaros doesn't have forcefields
[2:42:35] <jex771> man its been a while since I played
[2:42:36] <Bman1991> that dummy
[2:42:39] <jex771> the fuck is an inaros
[2:42:39] <+drecie> that's from the operator
[2:42:40] <+Ciphris> also new loka: *sends orokin tech to kill*
[2:42:41] <+MikoNoPants> Operator passives activate automatically now
[2:42:41] <+tylernator2777> Really you just pick the 3 syndicates on either side of the menu
[2:42:45] <deanbees> I mean, he can't.
[2:42:46] <+MGKBurrito> Steel meridian best faction with best waifu
[2:42:48] <DigbyMayor> Perrin is officially the pockets syndicate
[2:42:51] <+Skookah> "we"
[2:42:54] <Ichigo247> does one of them have zenistar ?
[2:42:55] <El_Samio> steel meridian: *exists*new loka: "THAT'S WRONG I WILL GENOCIDE YOU"
[2:43:00] <DefiniteRobot> past a certain point the invaders become jokes
[2:43:02] <Rogue657> @Ichigo247 Zenistar is a login reward
[2:43:05] <+JavaManJoJo> @jex771 Inaros is a mummy man
[2:43:10] <Kratok> @thelaxinator not at all. Pat was talking about it before, he's seen the spoiler boy before the War Within, but it's so out of context it doesn't really matter
[2:43:12] <jex771> gnarly
[2:43:15] <Lysdexic9541> @jex771 Pharaoh Mummy
[2:43:15] <+MikoNoPants> All Operator Passives activate automatically now so you don't need to transfer out to use them anymore
[2:43:19] <+kuervojones> Is pat playing on PS4 or PC?
[2:43:19] <+MrChapwhit> "boom de yada" - Rhino's in general
[2:43:19] <+tylernator2777> Zenistar is for logging in like 250 days in a row
[2:43:24] <Ripzombie> the "barrier" is a passive of zenurik energiising dash
[2:43:25] <DasZeleot> PC
[2:43:26] <Tucker0603> @mgkburrito your goddqmn right she the best waifu
[2:43:26] <jex771> fuck I wanna play warframe again
[2:43:27] <+MikoNoPants> or activate them anymore
[2:43:32] <Mrthepastyrider> Doing 4 of these Hemocytes is freaking awful.
[2:43:32] <+Ciphris> new loka: i-i-i-its ok if we do it
[2:43:35] <Ssaik> This game is so fucking cool
[2:43:39] <MMetas> @AngriestPat The "Shield" that you think is inaro's is a skill of zenurikk that regens your energy
[2:43:39] <akira_chong> Isn't Survival better than Defense for farming Argon Crystals?
[2:43:41] <Ichigo247> yeah i know i was trying to figure out the red circle thing near defence target @Rogue657
[2:43:42] <%Confused_4K> Big stomps
[2:43:43] <+MikoNoPants> But does Pat have energizing dash?
[2:43:43] <richieplays922> This looks awesome
[2:43:44] <sunny935> cant he sortie now?
[2:43:51] <SilvanSagevale> Zenistar if 500 days
[2:43:51] <Estuko> @akira_chong all the enemies come to you
[2:43:55] <cizal11> lmfao
[2:43:55] <Rogue657> @Ichigo247 That's zenurik energy field from someone else
[2:43:58] <anon_1307> SORTIE?
[2:43:58] <+MrChapwhit> @Mrthepastyrider what is your set up for it?

[2:44:06] <+HelloImTom08> LUL
[2:44:06] <%Wrashis> he already got one so i guess it doesnt matter if survival or defense is better
[2:44:08] <Lysdexic9541> Sandbag.
[2:44:08] <+tylernator2777> EVERYONE WHO IS SAYING THIS GAME IS COOL AND IS NOT PLAYING IT SHOULD BE PLAYING IT THIS GAME IS FUCKING FREE
[2:44:09] <InsomniacPersona> ? confused
[2:44:10] <Rogue657> @Mrthepastyrider Use chroma w/ a rapid fire high crit wep
[2:44:11] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> doodStare
[2:44:11] <+jestrfestr> oh yeah, he can do sorties now
[2:44:11] <+MikoNoPants> Zenurick Energizing dash probably needs unlocked first
[2:44:11] <iusetheinternet> zenistar is for 300 log ins
[2:44:14] <+SuichiTanaka> YO!!! LET'S GOOO~~
[2:44:14] <+MGKBurrito> why do he backflip so much?
[2:44:14] <%SilverFist91> @AngriestPat ...as in the Dood?
[2:44:15] <mitanzyr6> I understood that reference.
[2:44:17] <AC9_Nineball> He can Sortie, but he'd have to be carried
[2:44:21] <+GeneSlamm> DOO POO POOYA
[2:44:23] <akira_chong> @Estuko Don't they get stronger more quickly, though?
[2:44:24] <%shin_garbage> considering pat cant kill enemies on pluto, Sorties are very far away for him
[2:44:24] <sunny935> he has to do it this stream
[2:44:25] <deanbees> because flipping is fun
[2:44:29] <+HelloImTom08> @MGKBurrito to be a cool guy
[2:44:34] <K_ross> @mgkburrito because why not
[2:44:34] <Mrthepastyrider> @Rogue657 I'm building him now, but this is not worth the time investment
[2:44:39] <jfunk1993> @AngriestPat I'm surprised you didn't join New Loka. I thought you were pro Earth
[2:44:39] <+MGKBurrito> fair enough
[2:44:41] <Dead_Necro> i could probably carry him through the sortie lol
[2:44:51] <sunny935> needs to see how rhino caves LUL
[2:44:51] <Bman1991> he better rush it
[2:44:51] <Estuko> @akira_chong depends how fast you can kill, and there's just a small arena so it's all focused in a room.
[2:44:52] <richieplays922> Is tera any good I'm installing it now
[2:44:52] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat Pat before you do your personal quarters I HIGHLY suggest you do the harrow quest.That being said make sure you open your room ON STREAM.
[2:44:53] <thelaxinator> Cubed with the carry

[2:56:24] <%Lordgale119> Hey @AngriestPat the reason Alad V showing up in the Second Dream was so weird for you was because you didn't do Patient Zero, where he's gotten Infested and is letting it control him. Killing him in the bossfight the quest unlocks frees him from it, and is the reason he's helping us in Second Dream. Wanted to clear that up.
