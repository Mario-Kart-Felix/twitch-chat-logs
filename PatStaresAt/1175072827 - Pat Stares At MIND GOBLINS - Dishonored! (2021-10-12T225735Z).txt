[0:15:16] <PwnyB> You totally shouldn't steal food when your starving. /s
[0:15:18] <%DianaTheAscian> How dare they want things but not have the money for it

[0:15:50] <Ombrebird> gonna steal 2x as much if you don't
[0:15:50] <%SovPho> Jesus was like, "Yo if you need to do some borderline victimless crimes to survive maybe be a hooker it's fine."

[0:17:30] <$Jaxnos> i need people to keep thinking piracy is evil so i can continue to hear about both fun and stupid anti-piracy measures devs take part in
[0:17:30] <%Frost_Quill> Jesus MODDED water into wine.
[0:17:31] <%TheWinged7> you even bragged about it on the podvast

[0:17:36] <theloganbrand> It's okayy that company won't be around to sue you in a few months
[0:17:40] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Would Jesus have loved Chrono Trigger though!?
[0:17:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Kappa

[0:18:03] <%RealThiele> Jesus would have been down to play Chrono trigger on your emulator
[0:18:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> implied crimes can't be prosecutedd
[0:18:04] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat bought copies for himself and all his friends. Definitely

[0:26:14] <PanicSwytch> My current goblin is filling out the blurred spaces on Metroid dreads map
[0:26:15] <%hewlettfan96> Demand perfect play
[0:26:20] <%Profmcstevie> Dude dropping that target last time was funny as fuck
[0:26:20] <%blankwaffle> are collectathons goblins?
[0:26:21] <%JoshManVGH> Although the mana/hp system in Deathloop was WAY better that this potion shit
[0:26:22] <%Frost_Quill> I get stressed if I cheat in the Sims, THE most easily justifiable cheating in anything.  I can't cheat in games.
[0:26:28] <i_chevalier> Pat, do you have a pallet cleanser, for when you get mind goblins?
[0:26:31] <lemon_lover28> I do that in stealth games all the time as well because I like playing non-lethally
[0:26:37] <%trackles_64> Valhalla sucked balls
[0:26:40] <Dunmarkh> GET. INTO. COCKFIGHTING .
[0:26:44] <krypticfudge> when I saw it say goblin Dishonored I thought you were playing Styx: shards of darkness that shitty goblin stealth game.
[0:26:45] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I have that sort of, but my goblin is weak enough that after 3-4 do-overs, my lack of patients puts it down
[0:26:50] <%RayReborne> yeah i keep stopping and starting Valhalla
[0:26:51] <%Frost_Quill> Last AC I played was 2, heard Black Flag was good.
[0:26:55] <%hewlettfan96> Do u ever change your PJs? Patrick
[0:26:58] <SaltyAzteca> Oh it took you to Valhalla, youre a lot sterner than me
[0:26:59] <+yourspecialfriend562> Hi pat
[0:27:03] <%lumporr> it makes it less of a story about an unseeable Terror Magic Man and more about a cool dude working on a plot and i feel like the second one is more compelling
[0:27:05] <%RealThiele> find the 2 towers
[0:27:14] <%Treuan> Pain
[0:27:16] <@TheYellowcouch> When Doc is right, Doc is super right
[0:27:18] <%IronOhki> Oh that's like Destiny where you pick up the circle and put it in the place, then shoot some guys.
[0:27:19] <%castlerock42> God, it really is.
[0:27:21] <SilverFaustX> ELMO

[0:28:00] <%PrimalDweeb> He baby!
[0:28:03] <oda_flobunaga> Try Elite Dangerous, learn about Real busy work
[0:28:08] <%JoshManVGH> I liked Odyssey cause it was like "fuck it, just go do greek shit"
[0:28:13] <%Dakuu75> my cat get's pissed when I hold him like that XD
[0:28:14] <%RealThiele> he so floofy
[0:28:16] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @notsoy More games should feature a Majimo everywhere system
[0:28:18] <%PrimalDweeb> psaGib psaElmo
[0:28:18] <%Frost_Quill> I wish I could pick up my family's cats like that, they hate it unless my youngest sister does it. :(
[0:28:18] <%lumporr> such a cute kitty
[0:28:20] <SilverFaustX> mine likes to bang the litterbox at 5am..
[0:28:21] <%ForrestKrump> les goo
[0:28:25] <%thelaxinator> oh boy elite dangerous is a great flight simulator and a terrible game
[0:28:29] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Elmo is so bright in my screen.
[0:28:34] <SaltyAzteca> Cat has already been squished
[0:28:35] <%RealThiele> Elmo is the most chill
[0:28:39] <%Profmcstevie> Cat socialising is important at a young age
[0:28:41] <%RayReborne> probably because he used to be disabled as fuck Kappa
[0:28:46] <mads_valentine> Am I a cat?
[0:28:47] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> All cats a re born boomers
[0:28:49] <%Frost_Quill> As they should.
[0:28:50] <@Ranryu692> does anybody actually do that?
[0:28:53] <%lumporr> cats are conservatives
[0:28:57] <tanarath> emlo
[0:29:06] <@TheYellowcouch> Elmo is a good boy
[0:29:07] <%Dakuu75> wow lol
[0:29:07] <@TheYellowcouch> very smart
[0:29:09] <jerobees> @lumporr Slander
[0:29:10] <%PrimalDweeb> Lucky
[0:29:10] <SilverFaustX> rz
[0:29:11] <Captbutt> he's too good
[0:29:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> nice
[0:29:14] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @Ranryu692 I recently moved, and my cat lived in my bathroom for about 2 days
[0:29:15] <SilverFaustX> ez*
[0:29:15] <%Treuan> Cat dont care
[0:29:17] <%JoshManVGH> I gotta find a chill cat like that.
[0:29:18] <+Plaguemelon> Doesn't need to acclimate when he owns the world
[0:29:21] <tanarath> Emlo knew his home
[0:29:22] <Vyskus> It really helps if things smell like the old place still
[0:29:24] <oda_flobunaga> @thelaxinator my 1500 hours in that completely agree with you
[0:29:25] <jorniev> so he is fine whenever and he igoes crazy at any point
[0:29:27] <%castlerock42> What a ripoff. Took my cat like a week.
[0:29:28] <%vehementvadr> Elmo is too old to care
[0:29:33] <%Bionicghost> thank YOU pat
[0:29:33] <%RayReborne> yeah not good
[0:29:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> Cane here from Woolie cuz he absolutely refuses to fight the final boss in Dread to just hunt missiles an etanks that are taking him forever to nab
[0:29:37] <%Dakuu75> @Plaguemelon ^
[0:29:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think if they get a lot of attention when they're young it can help make them less skittish and weird
[0:29:43] <%scaryboisupreme> My cat hates when you pet him anywhere but his head
[0:29:49] <%purplestufff> yes
[0:29:51] <%PrimalDweeb> Ever
[0:29:53] <%Ne1son> Yeah fuck em
[0:29:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> good tip
[0:29:53] <%Wallabri> no that's bad
[0:29:54] <%trackles_64> And drink monster drinks
[0:29:54] <SaltyAzteca> That sounds painful to do
[0:29:55] <%WhereIsWill> caffeine is always the answer
[0:29:56] <%lumporr> take damage
[0:29:58] <%RealThiele> great advice. LUL
[0:30:00] <%RayReborne> ive never tried it but sure, why not Kappa
[0:30:01] <%castlerock42> Got 7:30 to 4 myself. It's worth it for two days off in a row.
[0:30:01] <bippityjones> But what if we're not 23 anymore?
[0:30:01] <SpookyMooks> fluffy boi
[0:30:01] <tanarath> Elmo was young once, but he was super comfortable with Paige & Pat.
[0:30:08] <%Wallabri> i'm tired just hearing that
[0:30:08] <+CookieCutter007> than you turn 20
[0:30:13] <%JoshManVGH> Damage yourself for your youthful hubris
[0:30:17] <%Frost_Quill> @scaryboisupreme My cat hates if I only pet her head.
[0:30:19] <%RayReborne> im 24 lol
[0:30:25] <%RealThiele> then you turn 28 and your spine gives up on you
[0:30:25] <%Dakuu75> gotta dread fast
[0:30:27] <%skeletonmilk> go fast eat ass
[0:30:28] <%TheHateFish> Hey, at least you get to finish at 3. I work seven to seven, four on four off. Which seven to seven? It changes every other block of four on.
[0:30:29] <SpookyMooks> the movement feels soo good
[0:30:30] <%WhereIsWill> that game looks incredible
[0:30:35] <%scaryboisupreme> Dread good, people saying its bad are insanos
[0:30:35] <%ForrestKrump> Jevil advice
[0:30:38] <%castlerock42> I'm 28 and not sleeping is apparently not an option for me anymore.
[0:30:41] <+handlantern> its midnight here in the uk so congrats on being what i feel asleep to
[0:30:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie sure ain't speedrunning rn LUL
[0:30:48] <%lumporr> the lack-of-sleep debuff scales with your level
[0:30:53] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt do you need some coffee bro?
[0:30:54] <Parapattern> Lil cat hops
[0:30:58] <SilverFaustX> elmo going on a adventure
[0:30:59] <jorniev> scattman
[0:31:05] <SilverFaustX> hop
[0:31:07] <SpookyMooks> he climbin
[0:31:07] <+yourspecialfriend562> Any good games on Telegraph switch I have to take a trip soon
[0:31:07] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:31:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> @castlerock42 Literally exact same. By 1am um done
[0:31:12] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @TheHateFish I did that for three years.
[0:31:13] <%Profmcstevie> Goblins know the matchup but have no endurance, keep fighting
[0:31:13] <%IronOhki> I just heard that!
[0:31:15] <+yourspecialfriend562> Switch*
[0:31:15] <%Frost_Quill> This game isn't poison to me, but I have to use a guide and find the vast majority of collectibles and money or I can't handle it.
[0:31:21] <theloganbrand> He was so worried
[0:31:24] <@TheYellowcouch> That makes all the sense
[0:31:30] <%RealThiele> everything is made up tho thats the trick
[0:31:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah anxiety seems wild if you don't deal with it all the time
[0:31:31] <%lumporr> the things in your head are real, perception is real
[0:31:33] <jorniev> you gave him cringe
[0:31:33] <+CookieCutter007> its just be like that
[0:31:33] <%trackles_64> OCD is just nutty
[0:31:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> They don't think it be like it is, but it do
[0:31:35] <%IronOhki> Woolie really does not grasp that this is an actual condition and not a made up wibblywob.
[0:31:36] <+bassforte123> I think he was more wondering how bad it gets, like does it go from vomit to actual fainting
[0:31:36] <%valriot> Woolie vomits looking at Doom maps
[0:31:38] <%TheHateFish> @Dakuu75 He's on that green monster ultra. Same hit, less prep. And also more additives, but eh.
[0:31:38] <%DianaTheAscian> He looked terrified
[0:31:39] <%lumporr> and your momma's back SHATTERS
[0:31:39] <%bob900000> aaaaaaahhhhhhbb
[0:31:40] <%blankwaffle> the brain is amazing
[0:31:41] <+emperri> yeah this game was deeply unpleasant to play
[0:31:43] <SaltyAzteca> Just go full Boomhauer one day LUL
[0:31:48] <%RayReborne> had you never talked about the ocd with Woolie before?
[0:31:49] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @Frost_Quill That's why I lived in dark vision. I could stand to possible walk past something.
[0:31:55] <ManfredA> The psyche and body are inextricably linked, stress can cause physical pain and even illness
[0:31:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> @IronOhki The real secret is that it's both
[0:31:58] <+emperri> jamaican me crazy
[0:32:04] <%lumporr> YEP
[0:32:05] <%Dakuu75> lol that sounds tough
[0:32:07] <%lumporr> i was basically a magician to them. it's a fun memory
[0:32:10] <%Bionicghost> scaaaaatman
[0:32:25] <%GalacticaPhanto> Pon De Anxiety
[0:32:27] <Abyssal_Jaguar> I fought the goblins twice on dishonored. The first time I got the bug that softlocks the game on the high chancellor mission.
[0:32:32] <%Wallabri> No, no, see if you step on a crack, you have to step on the next crack the exact same way with the other foot. Or you'll die. I guess. IDK brains are terrible.
[0:32:33] <Abyssal_Jaguar> The second time it did it AGAIN
[0:32:37] <General_Terro> kill those goblins
[0:32:39] <%Piemono> A made up series of rules you follow is pretty similar to personal ethics
[0:32:41] <SpookyMooks> power through the goblin horde
[0:32:44] <%Bionicghost> MIGHTY
[0:32:44] <%IronOhki> @ReallyBigRocks I mean, technically the truth. But if a doctor can say "yup you have the real actual thing" then that counts as a real actual thing to me.
[0:32:47] <%TheHateFish> Round and strong
[0:32:50] <%Profmcstevie> Just be like me, pull out a shotgun when the alert status in MGS3 won't go way fast enough
[0:32:58] <Abyssal_Jaguar> These streams are giving me the energy for the third try
[0:32:58] <munitalprats> ignore NMH3 even harder now
[0:33:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> Next mission is gonna be FUN
[0:33:02] <%TheHateFish> Quick, ignore it harder
[0:33:04] <%RealThiele> parasocial goblins
[0:33:12] <%Dakuu75> Is a Wizard and a Mage the same thing?
[0:33:24] <%RealThiele> so wait a year then play it LUL
[0:33:33] <+emperri> juice go down
[0:33:34] <Visorak6> Normal mode is toned down from tabletop
[0:33:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> De-Juicing
[0:33:36] <@commanderclaw> The game *wants* you to Minmax hard
[0:33:36] <ManfredA> NO
[0:33:37] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Oh, god no,normal is FOR minmaxers
[0:33:39] <Visorak6> Core is "normal"
[0:33:48] <ManfredA> it drops them down a bit but they're already super juiced up
[0:33:48] <%JoshManVGH> Pathfinder is busted as nuts in general, it's a wild ride
[0:33:49] <PinkSocks> normal is hard...
[0:33:49] <+Vigonept> go baby shit mode not normal
[0:33:49] <%notsoy> yeah, it's toned down because you have 6 dudes, PF party is normally 4 guys
[0:33:51] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Easy
[0:33:52] <%NeoCre> Yes
[0:33:53] <CatRidder> YES
[0:33:54] <@commanderclaw> Easy
[0:33:55] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[0:33:57] <@TheYellowcouch> not playing
[0:33:58] <Visorak6> Easy
[0:33:59] <%lumporr> eating, sleeping
[0:33:59] <%RealThiele> pathfinder expects 4 encounters per adventuring day
[0:34:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pathfinder is not for humans
[0:34:00] <%Frost_Quill> "Wait when did I miss a rune?...Oh all the way back in mission 2..." is the reason I keep a guide open while playing these kinds of games.
[0:34:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I played like half the game before I realized I liked it less when there were millions of rats and plague corpses everywhere, and stopped killing people.
[0:34:04] <+Vigonept> baby mode
[0:34:05] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt The first REAL boss in Wrath is 8 levels above you
[0:34:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> The Aeon Mythic Path lets you see into the past and retcon certain events.
[0:34:06] <%Piemono> Normal you don't have to minimax as much
[0:34:08] <CatRidder> easy
[0:34:09] <draca23> not really...Pathfinder is easily busted with magic/consumables
[0:34:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah I keep getting my ass handed to me
[0:34:12] <munitalprats> pathfinder is not for humans
[0:34:13] <%NeoCre> Normal difficulty
[0:34:14] <%baronblank> even normal is crazy, at level 8 you're fighting shit that's like cr 20 lol
[0:34:22] <Lefanque> the pathfinder games are very learn as you play kind of games
[0:34:25] <%Dakuu75> that sounds... not fair
[0:34:27] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Later on most enemies are 30 levels above level cap
[0:34:28] <Prism_Wing> pat :)
[0:34:29] <%TheHateFish> @ReallyBigRocks @PatStaresAt This, basically
[0:34:31] <Lefanque> kingmaker is worse
[0:34:31] <%Laecerelius> Oh you fight shit that's WAAAY higher level than you in that game
[0:34:36] <%notsoy> you also do way more fighting than a normal PF pnp session
[0:34:37] <+Vigonept> Its still fucked
[0:34:40] <Visorak6> Kingmaker has some extremely frustrating encounters
[0:34:41] <@commanderclaw> Kingmaker's kingdom management shit is cancer IMO
[0:34:41] <Archmortal> this sounds like the kind of shit I put together in my DnD games
[0:34:45] <munitalprats> i want to see pats mindgoblins in a TTRPG
[0:34:46] <ManfredA> someone posted the final boss's stat sheet and he has like 50 levels
[0:34:49] <%JGardner03> oh wow im glad I didn't grab that game, I would've went Normal too
[0:34:51] <%NeoCre> You get things to make up for level difference
[0:34:56] <%Felhad> Hi Pat you're Pat

[0:35:18] <+emperri> "the boldest measures are the safest" - game that penalizes you for murder
[0:35:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's too stealthy
[0:35:21] <%Bionicghost> shyhonored
[0:35:25] <%valriot> Older game, mediocre PC port
[0:35:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> sneaky game
[0:35:28] <@Ranryu692> if it gets recorded it'll be high chaos
[0:35:30] <@TheYellowcouch> Get in the goblin pat
[0:35:37] <%JoshManVGH> The outsider watches, he is not watched
[0:35:48] <SaltyAzteca> IT REQUIRES BLOOD
[0:35:51] <%castlerock42> Probably won't stay clean.
[0:35:51] <%JoshManVGH> Now go get Twins, Basil.
[0:35:53] <SaltyAzteca> THE BLOOD OF THE GUILTY

[0:36:12] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Just imagine what the boatman is seeing.
[0:36:15] <Dunmarkh> @oda_flobunaga not on purpose
[0:36:17] <bsudo> @bsudo is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[0:36:17] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Just killed high overseer
[0:36:23] <+victhebeard> you got this Pat, teach those mind goblins whos the boss goblin.
[0:36:27] <+emperri> meow
[0:36:27] <%NeoCre> Tuned for lean
[0:36:28] <Abyssal_Jaguar> This badass decides to just do a little dance
[0:36:34] <munitalprats> this levels gonna be a clusterfuck
[0:36:36] <ToneBacas> so do you have infinite stamina or what? heard you talk about cheat engine earlier but did not understand it
[0:36:36] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, made it to Heavensward in 14 and been running into problems in 8 man content since people don't like to explain mechanics to me when I tell them I'm knew.  Should I spoil myself and watch guides before content or hope I meet nicer people when I go into Duties?
[0:36:39] <%Felhad> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:36:40] <HeroSolaire> does mind goblin condition also include low FOV?
[0:36:41] <oda_flobunaga> High Chaos to challenge the goblins head on
[0:36:43] <ToneBacas> stamina i mean mana
[0:36:43] <%SpoonheadInExile> Ya gonna whack some mooks in da HOOAH house
[0:36:44] <%IronOhki> @victhebeard It's Pat! Pat is boss goblin!
[0:36:44] <@Ranryu692> are we going to a hoor house?
[0:36:44] <AvroEltz> Lessgo golden cat
[0:36:44] <ManfredA> Pendleton likes to do a little prostituting I guess
[0:36:47] <bippityjones> Just remember, 20%
[0:36:48] <%Dakuu75> put on your game face
[0:36:51] <%JoshManVGH> oh man you're going to shit when you see the Custom Difficulty settings in Dishonored 2 @patstaresat
[0:36:51] <%maenos2> whorehouse time
[0:37:01] <Dunmarkh> @ToneBacas he is not using cheat engine.
[0:37:04] <%Ziegsy> Corvo has a tiny face
[0:37:10] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Everyone in this game is beyond aggressively british ugly
[0:37:13] <%Forbidden_Karp> was the game this widescreen last time?
[0:37:17] <AvroEltz> is there any whussy in the golden cat?
[0:37:29] <PantsSoldSeparately> hello pat, good luck with goblin planet
[0:37:31] <munitalprats> the russy
[0:37:33] <%JoshManVGH> Slackjaw is a fun piece of shit
[0:37:33] <%Felhad> @butthurtdave most duties and dungeons from Heavensward and on can be run blindly, the mechanics markers become standardized
[0:37:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> dawtor
[0:37:52] <%JoshManVGH> Noooooooooo...
[0:37:54] <Abyssal_Jaguar> @oda_flobunaga The point isn't to give up and kill everyone, It's to be able to accept the small human failures.
[0:37:54] <%Forbidden_Karp> oh nvm, cutscene camera

[0:39:46] <%JoshManVGH> Mocking you I guess
[0:39:47] <huskarl_zap> killing infected makes plague go UP somehow
[0:39:48] <intestinal_bleeding> "can't say I like that"

[0:40:12] <%bassoontyphoon> CHA-OSSY
[0:40:14] <%JoshManVGH> @realthiele What does that even mean!?
[0:40:14] <%Forbidden_Karp> oh god I forgot whussy... what a short, blessed time
[0:40:18] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> The game is being passive aggressive.
[0:40:19] <munitalprats> drown him!
[0:40:20] <TioXyco> I mean, what not say that to you again?
[0:40:26] <%notsoy> does dumping him in the water kill him?
[0:40:31] <bippityjones> Just somewhere shady
[0:40:34] <Visorak6> under the bridge like the troll he is
[0:40:34] <%Profmcstevie> Game IS fairly stupid, we've said this
[0:40:37] <munitalprats> as we've all know, rats can't swim anyway
[0:40:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> nappin on a pipe
[0:40:40] <$Jaxnos> he do the drown
[0:40:44] <SaltyAzteca> well yeah lol, cant swim
[0:40:44] <%RealThiele> @JoshManVGH i guess it happens the more you stab into that whussy
[0:40:47] <Qu1ckyyy> Do they wake up after a while?
[0:40:55] <%Cozy90> give him a snorkel for water naps
[0:40:55] <%owensleftfoot> was that a thing in thief?
[0:40:56] <%xcompleasedad> He won't know to hold is breath, on account of the brain damage
[0:40:57] <Doomstricken> I once accidentally dipped a guard into the water for 4 seconds and it killed him
[0:41:00] <Abyssal_Jaguar> These people may be rat people, that can not swim
[0:41:00] <tijikiotecalt> the sign should've said "no rats allowed" idiots
[0:41:00] <%JoshManVGH> oh god!
[0:41:01] <%AkronymCLT> Also there are fish in the water that'd probably eat him anyway
[0:41:01] <@TheYellowcouch> But at least the rats wouldn't be able to get the corpse
[0:41:03] <tanarath> Pat, there's a dumpster
[0:41:05] <%NeoCre> @qu1ckyyy Nit unless they are found
[0:41:16] <munitalprats> R A T

[0:41:44] <%owensleftfoot> well atleast we know for certain rats drown, right guys? Kappa
[0:41:48] <CH3F015> I like Nick's delivery. it make the debate more entertaining.
[0:41:53] <CH3F015> LUL
[0:41:54] <%xcompleasedad> Rat killing should LOWER Chaos
[0:41:56] <+emperri> these guys seem unpurturbed by your space magic
[0:41:56] <%NeoCre> I like the feel of this game without piss vision. Much more tense
[0:41:57] <%Profmcstevie> Oh god I almost forgot about the double yump
[0:41:59] <munitalprats> LOL
[0:42:01] <$Jaxnos> yeehaw

[0:43:58] <%Forbidden_Karp> why are we cool with straight killing them?
[0:44:01] <whittacre> you made a ruckus last mission so they came to check it out
[0:44:12] <TrollKing96> Does killing those dudes increase Chaos?
[0:44:13] <munitalprats> @Forbidden_Karp does it matter? let him play the way he wants
[0:44:22] <bippityjones> They look cool
[0:44:22] <Animal_Farm4> They are NOT aggro
[0:44:22] <whittacre> I'm pretty sure they're neutral right now
[0:44:23] <MechanizedGentleman> Bottle Street Boys rule!
[0:44:23] <%scaryboisupreme> no
[0:44:24] <mads_valentine> No.
[0:44:24] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Charms in 2 are busted cuz you can craft 1 charm with up to 4 effects each and also Black Charms with watered down boss abilities

[0:44:34] <+critikal_bit> Don't think so
[0:44:35] <%scaryboisupreme> they said they wanted to meet right
[0:44:35] <%Forbidden_Karp> @Forbidden_Karp no sure, no problems there, just curious given Pat's usual MO
[0:44:38] <%NeoCre> @trollking96 It takes A LOT of killing
[0:44:39] <wolverinewaswrong> I think it tells you if you're in a hostile area
[0:44:39] <%Cozy90> if you shoot them maybe
[0:44:40] <%bassoontyphoon> No
[0:44:46] <%ScreamLord> They dunno you did it
[0:44:47] <%NeoCre> No
[0:44:55] <outsidedoubtside> has anyone told Pat that the high chaos ending explained is actually way more interesting as a level?
[0:44:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> wonder where the distillery is
[0:44:56] <munitalprats> @wolverinewaswrong only in 2
[0:44:59] <@Ranryu692> @Forbidden_Karp changing that is the entire purpose of this series of streams
[0:45:01] <%Laecerelius> But not TOO much murder.  Just under 20% murder
[0:45:01] <munitalprats> oh shidd nvm
[0:45:13] <TioXyco> oops

[0:45:49] <%Ziegsy> So chat, talking about bad days; I  pooped so hard I burst an ovarian cyst. So my day was GREAT. how was yours?
[0:45:52] <whittacre> the green pyramid thing
[0:45:53] <%dalmek> it's from I Think You Should Leave
[0:45:57] <%Forbidden_Karp> @Forbidden_Karp I get that, it just seemed different from the last stream is all, which is fine - just wondered whether there was something about those enemies that made killing them more desirable
[0:45:59] <%WhereIsWill> death stranding joke? or the happening?
[0:46:00] <@Ranryu692> isn't that from Community?
[0:46:11] <$Jaxnos> look at those cuties
[0:46:12] <churropoppa> boomers complaining about the economy
[0:46:19] <%SovPho> can you kill weepers with low chaos?

[0:46:34] <wolverinewaswrong> can you kill weepers with low chaos? yes
[0:46:37] <@Ranryu692> oh, no, it's from I Think You Should Leave
[0:46:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SovPho still contributes to chaos iirc
[0:46:45] <Animal_Farm4> They changed all the locks after the break in :)
[0:46:46] <Dunmarkh> To a different building

[1:06:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> [ACTING]
[1:06:13] <%valriot> Not quite Rex from Xenoblade tier
[1:06:14] <%IronOhki> When making a recording about a person's name, make sure you say that fucking name before you die.
[1:06:15] <CatRidder> what a VA
[1:06:16] <s1rcuit> he didn't even get the message across

[1:07:12] <+emperri> why does "particular tastes" always end up being gross
[1:07:12] <%Forbidden_Karp> these people with their freakishly large hands
[1:07:34] <HotMafia81> Already gotcha chief, it's 0452
[1:07:37] <+emperri> you fuck little boys slackjaw
[1:07:37] <sexycars420> why does he dress like a normal portland resident?
[1:07:37] <%stubborndeer> Don't od it, He''ll just use the money to kill another space pig
[1:07:38] <HotMafia81> 0451 fuck
[1:07:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that seems almost too good
[1:07:57] <MechanizedGentleman> A safe full of fabulous wealth, eh? We definitely wont steal that
[1:08:06] <PunishedMercer_> this one's a varying combo i think.
[1:08:07] <s1rcuit> just because HE doesn't kill them doesn't mean they won't end up dead
[1:08:08] <%castlerock42> So rob a place and someone'll do your job for you? Why isn't this an option in real life?
[1:08:12] <+pectusumbra> I think that's where he fucks them up and sends them to the mines or the like
[1:08:18] <%Profmcstevie> The whores done raised a good boy
[1:08:22] <Blu_C> What's the over-under on the twins accidently getting unalived.
[1:08:26] <+emperri> @castlerock42 it is, it's called capitalism
[1:08:26] <munitalprats> no you can totally rob it
[1:08:30] <%Logoth_> Rob it anyway
[1:08:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> un-rob it?
[1:08:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Slackjaw has a beef with the brothers anyway so he was going to do it to them anyway this way he gets a favor out of the deal
[1:08:36] <MechanizedGentleman> But why NOT rob it when you can rob it?
[1:08:38] <+CAPSLOCKlive> not rob it just de-populate it maybe
[1:08:38] <%Faustgesicht> or use the combo to steal the art, and give him the combo. is what i'd you
[1:08:38] <Zeif00> he kinda hot too
[1:08:39] <ape_hawk> burglary =/= robbing
[1:08:40] <munitalprats> fuck em'
[1:08:42] <%NeoCre> I really like the non lethal for the twins. It’s SUPER rough
[1:08:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt He even compliments you for doing so
[1:08:44] <%lumporr> *not* rob? what a silly concept
[1:08:45] <TioXyco> hobbit then
[1:08:47] <+pectusumbra> Rob everything but the safe I'd guess
[1:08:50] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> robber is great! It's what jesus would want
[1:08:51] <%castlerock42> @emperri You know, you got me, there.
[1:08:52] <%bassoontyphoon> Is his jaw slacked from all that Whussy?

[1:09:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @doc_ock_rokc ah, I see
[1:09:04] <privatecorgi> This place is a shithole
[1:09:09] <%lumporr> @ape_hawk "all i did was burgle! no robbin, i swear!"

[1:50:10] <%Piemono> Pat became too accustomed to his mind goblins, so -ussy comments need to fill the void
[1:50:11] <%bassoontyphoon> If we keep him focussed on Whussy he’ll forget to worry about his goblins
[1:50:11] <@Ranryu692> @oda_flobunaga hmm, yes, then only we mods could say whussy
[1:50:16] <tj_timbs> @HotSauceFiend naw. just sparing people
[1:50:22] <%twistedj3ster> give us whussy emote
[1:50:23] <munitalprats> WHAT A GOOD FATE

[1:50:43] <@TheYellowcouch> Banned for Whussy crimes
[1:50:45] <tj_timbs> so we just assume he's gonna get all that done
[1:50:45] <%shurtal> but emote only means Cozy can't determine if something is Hot or Not
[1:50:46] <%CapnBeefs> Drive that shame car straight into chat
[1:50:47] <+temporaryplaceholder> vvussy emote

[1:51:06] <%G_Thunders> Why would he do that for you if there’s nothing in the safe?
[1:51:07] <%Laecerelius> Only a few deaths
[1:51:09] <+jingokrieg> OK so what does goblin mean ?
[1:51:12] <%Laecerelius> Like what, 9 or so?
[1:51:13] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Pat I'm disappointed in you for not murdering the rich
[1:51:14] <thewrathofscience> This is way better than murder somehow
[1:51:18] <+chiazam> Wait how does giving him the safe combo mean they're neutralized
[1:51:20] <+pectusumbra> @miguelrod777 That's what makes it all worth it
[1:51:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Ranryu692 I'd vote for that
[1:51:24] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Man, I'm so depressed
[1:51:25] <ape_hawk> only a few nameless deaths
[1:51:33] <teridax4> No one died!
[1:51:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> whale meats

[1:51:41] <+Bogart4321> corpse nothin
[1:51:44] <Parapattern> And no one important got killed
[1:51:44] <%Forbidden_Karp> I dunno, but I think we should maybe be looking at alternative energy sources
[1:51:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Ok, crew, lobotomized and made slaves or death, I wonder what is worse? hmmmmmmm
[1:51:49] <tj_timbs> @chiazam he cut us a deal to neutralize them if we gave him the safe combo
[1:51:50] <munitalprats> @chiazam he literally said he'd take care of them
[1:51:51] <+pectusumbra> @chiazam Slackjaw just does it for you
[1:51:52] <%stubborndeer> LADY WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN A BOAT
[1:52:02] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @jingokrieg Mind Goblins in this case refers to his ocd

[1:55:10] <tj_timbs> IT ABSOLUTELY IS
[1:55:10] <+temporaryplaceholder> Money was probably on people's corpses?
[1:55:10] <@TheYellowcouch> Imagine spending months worrying about this system
[1:55:12] <%twistedj3ster> money is stupid
[1:55:12] <privatecorgi> Its impossible to find all the money
[1:55:12] <%castlerock42> They only said low chaos, not no chaos.
[1:55:18] <%SovPho> you'll get plenty of money
[1:55:18] <CatRidder> CHAOS
[1:55:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> scrounge for coins on the ground like a hobo
[1:55:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt finding all the money in a Dishonored level is nonsense
[1:55:20] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah that needs some fucking scrounging
[1:55:22] <Parapattern> You would have to SCRAPE for that dosh
[1:55:26] <%stubborndeer> You have to frequent stores to get M O N E Y
[1:55:26] <AvroEltz> no, you can get a lot, but you need to SCRUNGE
[1:55:28] <%RayReborne> Why even track coins? thats so stupid
[1:55:31] <tj_timbs> do you know how much the money in this game triggers OCD?
[1:55:34] <%SovPho> there's just one specific level where you start getting an absolute fuckton of cash
[1:55:35] <+temporaryplaceholder> Being a good person is expensive
[1:55:38] <privatecorgi> 12s of months!
[1:55:39] <+psychotripstreams> Pat you saved this game for me when you explained how chaos works
[1:55:47] <%Forbidden_Karp> I admire Pat's goblin-slaying - I couldn't get past the first mission
[1:55:51] <%JoshManVGH> and you typically get more money from all the other shit

[1:58:55] <%shurtal> i just got the "Bio-Doma II" achievement, wtf Koji?
[1:58:56] <AvroEltz> i really like the pistol upgrades just because by the end it almost looks like a scifi gun
[1:58:56] <%Forbidden_Karp> thanks Grima
[1:58:56] <%stubborndeer> REmemeber you can resupply him pat
[1:58:57] <tj_timbs> if you get most of the money through each level, you run out of upgrades by like the 4th or 5th mission
[1:59:08] <%Laecerelius> free money!
[1:59:08] <%stubborndeer> Find wooden crates covered in Canvas and bring them to him
[1:59:12] <%GarbageNirvana> You think there's anyone out there who plays this game with a "go loud" build
[1:59:12] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why is Darkvision a supernatural power when it coulda been a mask upgrade?
[1:59:15] <%stubborndeer> NOT WHAT THE QUEST SAYS
[1:59:23] <@Ranryu692> meanwhile you're drowning in the stuff
[1:59:27] <kazadog> i love brad dourif but i feel like hes super underutilised in this game
[1:59:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> @ToneBacas I think you have to actually do stuff for him to unlock things so there's an excuse here
[1:59:28] <munitalprats> @Bane_Kaikyo because that's work
[1:59:40] <+temporaryplaceholder> "Attention: This is a reminder that we're definitely the bad guys. Thank you for your attention."

[1:59:55] <%SovPho> whahussy
[1:59:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Pat has come to enjoy it
[1:59:55] <comicalmond> to late

[2:00:05] <%shurtal> Danger Danger, HIGH VOLTAGE
[2:00:06] <+voidcharms> whussy one might say
[2:00:06] <+pectusumbra> He's beginning to believe
[2:00:06] <+FatherGreyBeard> WHAT
[2:00:07] <oda_flobunaga> so we do serve a purpose
[2:00:08] <@Ranryu692> think about dolphin dick instead
[2:00:08] <%maskofmichael> he said the thing
[2:00:09] <%miguelrod777> the whales are massive in this world
[2:00:10] <@TheYellowcouch> Has your opinion on the game changed now?
[2:00:10] <AvroEltz> We wont allow you to stop thinking about whussy
[2:00:11] <Abyssal_Jaguar> You're doing awesome pat!
[2:00:12] <NateyBeak> we need a more gobliny game then
[2:00:15] <%Bane_Kaikyo> "WHAHUSSY"
[2:00:15] <%IronOhki> Did you know the TV show "Centaurworld" is fucking bat shit insane?
[2:00:17] <munitalprats> you thought about it too
[2:00:17] <%Laecerelius> So the whale oil comes from the whussy?
[2:00:18] <ape_hawk> whussies are always lubed up with whale oil
[2:00:20] <+temporaryplaceholder> LUL LUL LUL LUL GOBLIN'D
[2:00:20] <munitalprats> You thought about just buying 8
[2:00:20] <thelonechris> "That is up to GOD."
[2:00:21] <%TheWinged7> just think about whale dork instead then pat
[2:00:22] <%SinnerEbru> it IS up to god
[2:00:23] <%IronOhki> Saying so for reasons.
[2:00:24] <munitalprats> or 9
[2:00:25] <kazadog> theres a reason this is a MIND GOBLINS playthrough
[2:00:25] <%spitelite> whussy juice?
[2:00:26] <%Ziegsy> Moby Dick ends with a circle jerk
[2:00:27] <+probably_facetious> You cannot escape the whussy pat
[2:00:27] <OverlordedK> I always just buy like 8 sleep darts cause you find 'em all over LUL
[2:00:30] <$realm_forge> DONT THINK ABOUT THE SECRETIONS PAT
[2:00:31] <%SaiyanShoto> Whussy 2: Electric boogaloo
[2:00:32] <%Bionicghost> Have you heard of dolphin pu**y jelly?
[2:00:34] <Aoworth> Extra darts NotLikeThis
[2:00:34] <coreybom> The oil be drippin out that whussy. Drip drip.
[2:00:36] <privatecorgi> Extract the whale oil from the whussy
[2:00:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> stressful, or tense?
[2:00:39] <%RealThiele> sneak into the Whussy
[2:00:40] <%maenos2> I mean I know dolphin jelly makes you cum but whussy electricity does too?
[2:00:40] <%Forbidden_Karp> @SinisterBroccoli aww totally missed that
[2:00:44] <+rafaelba93> it relaxing af on the 5th run
[2:00:50] <%SovPho> @Bane_Kaikyo yw
[2:00:51] <%DianaTheAscian> I always find them satisfying
[2:00:53] <+Bogart4321> whussy is a part of the fail state
[2:00:54] <kazadog> i absolutely love going for ghost runs in every stealth game so I know Pat's issue
[2:00:56] <+KingpinLarry> I had a hard time beating this the first time. Played it again a few years later on PS4 and went through it like nothing.
[2:00:57] <3viltiki> The next step in KY Jelly, Whussy Oil
[2:01:02] <+pyrojack6> i got plenty stressed in the second dishonored since the later enemied are a bit of a bitch
[2:01:03] <ape_hawk> now do the entire metal gear solid series
[2:01:04] <%Cozy90> are rhombuses stressful?
[2:01:06] <Zombrocom> That might be true if you didn't have a million get out of jail free cards
[2:01:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> just don't
[2:01:14] <%baka_sugoi> GOBLIN REVENGE
[2:01:14] <@Ranryu692> that would be interesting
[2:01:16] <%MidnightBurst12> You'll be fine
[2:01:17] <munitalprats> don't think about it
[2:01:18] <+pyrojack6> Rhombussy?
[2:01:20] <shadowstep1998> gotta have us to be accountable
[2:01:20] <+KingpinLarry> Fished man
[2:01:20] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:01:23] <%SovPho> Why would you name yourselves that
[2:01:23] <+dante_must_die_exe> that would be huge
[2:01:23] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Having people keep you honest can help
[2:01:30] <Mister_McDerp> fear the return of the goblin
[2:01:36] <mrblack499> dont think about it
[2:01:39] <HotMafia81> 6head
[2:01:44] <%SovPho> Froppy lookin mf
[2:01:47] <%Forbidden_Karp> his forehead also gets a seat in Parliament
[2:01:48] <SpookyMooks> square ass head
[2:01:49] <Zombrocom> EVERYONE looks like a freak in this world
[2:01:50] <+BlueLunecy> Probably the inbreeding
[2:01:53] <%RealThiele> as opposed to everyone else looking normal?
[2:01:54] <@Ranryu692> do mind goblins have pussies? mind gussy?
[2:01:58] <%miguelrod777> they were his brothers
[2:01:58] <%Laecerelius> HE looks inbred, which he probably is
[2:02:02] <+temporaryplaceholder> He looks like he just got done watching a playground for no reason
[2:02:06] <%Saadi90> He looks like my high school principal. It’s wild
[2:02:09] <privatecorgi> Most handsome English man
[2:02:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> goblussy
[2:02:13] <%maenos2> @ranryu692 regular goblins do so I imagine yes
[2:02:13] <+pectusumbra> I mean he's the alcoholic 3rd sibling
[2:02:17] <+Bogart4321> the english language is so versatile....whussy
[2:02:20] <+pyrojack6> always morally correct
[2:02:21] <munitalprats> people TOTALLY DO
[2:02:22] <Mister_McDerp> goblussy LUL
[2:02:25] <+KingpinLarry> He doesn't care what happened to his brothers. Why would he care about Corvo?
[2:02:26] <Zombrocom> They did take big shots at used games
[2:02:27] <Aoworth> Why is he not grateful? You did the n o n l e t h a l path
[2:02:29] <HotMafia81> Hey man, your brothers are still ALIVE, they're just unrecognizable, mute, and you'll never get to see them again.  Don't be so glum
[2:02:33] <%RealThiele> the whole industry has tried for years to kill used games
[2:02:37] <%bassoontyphoon> Mind goblussy
[2:02:42] <%Laecerelius> Yeah wasn't the Xbone gonna have some anti-used games bullshit?
[2:02:43] <Doomstricken> Remember when microsoft tried to put anti-used game DRM on xbox?
[2:02:45] <crassletter> THEY WERE
[2:02:48] <%SovPho> 7th generation? Which one was that?
[2:02:52] <%Agami23> yeah
[2:02:52] <%SovPho> oh PS3 360
[2:02:53] <munitalprats> but Xcom though
[2:02:54] <jorniev> yes
[2:02:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Bogart4321 It's real fun to just mash a bunch of syllables together
[2:02:56] <comicalmond> how?
[2:02:57] <Mister_McDerp> yeah
[2:02:57] <%Ipsenscastle> absolutely
[2:02:57] <ExpressNode> Speaking of 7th gen just got a JP PS3 and fuck those button reassignments
[2:02:57] <%vapelad_dabberb01> he's right
[2:02:57] <yukichocomilk> I love piracy though
[2:02:57] <%Saadi90> Agreed
[2:02:57] <%SinnerEbru> they  were
[2:02:59] <crassletter> IT TOTALLY WAS
[2:02:59] <+KingpinLarry> 50/50 I'd say
[2:03:00] <LilacsandFreedom> it's true
[2:03:00] <%GustauveVIII> i think the only game i thoroughly enjoyed on ps3 was god of war
[2:03:02] <ChloeFleurage> 7th gen was a gen of proof of concept
[2:03:02] <%JoshManVGH> Remember XBOX One tried to kill resale of physical games.
[2:03:03] <+itsjayrome> then gen was entirely FPS games so, yes
[2:03:04] <televisedrevolting> Bulletstorm Fuck you
[2:03:05] <Blu_C> Hmmmm.
[2:03:05] <+temporaryplaceholder> The PS3 had no games
[2:03:05] <%RayReborne> especially including the WII?!? DAMN RIGHT
[2:03:06] <jorniev> WINDOWS GAMES
[2:03:07] <%SovPho> Idk, Halo 3
[2:03:07] <%twistedj3ster> they haven't really improved
[2:03:07] <Aoworth> Yeah, on average that seems right
[2:03:08] <%Agami23> Xcom was shit when it launched
[2:03:08] <Reveresao> Generation BROWN
[2:03:10] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt You're playing a 360 game right now
[2:03:11] <Doomstricken> yeah the 7th generation was such a dire time
[2:03:11] <+pyrojack6> yeah, theres like maybe 10 that are good that everyone can agree on
[2:03:11] <CatRidder> because ps2 was better
[2:03:12] <LilacsandFreedom> Viva Pinata was good
[2:03:14] <ChloeFleurage> "Look this game can totally work, ignore all the texture pop-in and jittering"
[2:03:15] <munitalprats> Halo 3
[2:03:15] <%Saadi90> Except Dark Souls. Everything was crap
[2:03:17] <jorniev> ITS ALL WINDOWS FAULT
[2:03:17] <%SaiyanShoto> It was, all the worst tropes came out of those games and they all had a color scheme of brown and grey
[2:03:17] <%greasypete00> 7th gen was the entirety of the last 15 years pat
[2:03:18] <HotMafia81> There were a lot of ruts being stuck in during that generations
[2:03:19] <munitalprats> VIVA PINATA
[2:03:21] <$SGrim> Pat, PS3/360 started 15 years ago. There's only been upgrades since.
[2:03:23] <%Cykron> Lots of good games from that era
[2:03:24] <+KingpinLarry> Unreal 3 Engine 4 lyfe
[2:03:25] <@TheYellowcouch> hmmmmm over all yes. some stand outs but over all
[2:03:26] <ExpressNode> Yeah you're right on that one the jump from SD to HD was fucky
[2:03:27] <%maskofmichael> At least we still had games
[2:03:27] <%polothegreatest> How yo make piracy dissapear: Make more sales.
[2:03:32] <%castlerock42> Looked was debatable, but they definitely ran like shit.
[2:03:32] <%lumporr> yay halo
[2:03:32] <thelonechris> I kinda miss the infinity loads of shovelware for the Wii
[2:03:34] <televisedrevolting> Viva Pinata and Bulletstorm fuck you
[2:03:35] <comicalmond> @televisedrevolting I love bullet storm
[2:03:39] <%Agami23> viva pinata was a sparkling gem in the filth
[2:03:41] <+malfion> Yeah Dishonored held up and was unique for its time
[2:03:41] <%Faustgesicht> mostly fine
[2:03:43] <+itsjayrome> these controls are tight as fuck
[2:03:43] <%SaiyanShoto> Even this game has a grey and brown color scheme
[2:03:43] <%stubborndeer> OH man is that Whiskey or Cream whisky
[2:03:45] <%stubborndeer> whiskey
[2:03:47] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt that whole gen was like 85% bad
[2:03:48] <%JoshManVGH> There was A LOT of 7th gen trash
[2:03:48] <Doomstricken> Dishonored also has a significant art style that makes it stand out from its peers
[2:03:49] <@Ranryu692> I dunno, I feel like there are just *so* many 7th gen games that it runs the whole spectrum
[2:03:49] <%SinnerEbru> thats high praise
[2:03:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think even the look kinda holds up
[2:03:51] <Parapattern> It's held up since it focused on a cohesive art style instead of aping realism
[2:03:51] <PwnyB> Wasn't 7th gen when D1 came out like fucking broken as hell?
[2:03:56] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt I think that 360 PS3 era was just a sheer volume of games on everything, including PC. Asset flips etc became so popular that they just got shotgunned at us.
[2:03:59] <Brutusness> I think the stylization of the characters helps
[2:04:00] <+psychotripstreams> Every generation has great games, but Pat is right overall. &th gen was the gen of "Everythng grey, gritty, and derivative"
[2:04:02] <televisedrevolting> @comicalmond Bulletstorm rules and no one will ever talk about it.
[2:04:03] <comicalmond> mass effect
[2:04:05] <+Bogart4321> was that a box of ammo on their table?
[2:04:06] <%JoshManVGH> Remember Blue Dragon?
[2:04:06] <jorniev> go fuck yourself martin
[2:04:07] <OverlordedK> Man pat just shitting hard on half the yakuza series
[2:04:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> @stubborndeer Whiskey Jell-O
[2:04:10] <OverlordedK> hate to see it
[2:04:11] <comicalmond> metal gear solid 4
[2:04:17] <+pyrojack6> people still play Modern Warfare
[2:04:19] <%shurtal> infinite undiscovery
[2:04:20] <%twistedj3ster> but 50 Cent, Blood on the Sand!
[2:04:21] <EASrake> true
[2:04:26] <@Ranryu692> Bulletstorm is great
[2:04:28] <televisedrevolting> YES
[2:04:29] <Aoworth> LUL
[2:04:29] <%Ne1son> Game is so Fucking Good
[2:04:29] <+Bogart4321> please kill my dick
[2:04:30] <Jaysky> Yes
[2:04:31] <+D00msDayDan> yeah wasn't it great
[2:04:32] <ZilverZap> Not his dick D:
[2:04:32] <ape_hawk> bulletstorm is great
[2:04:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> People like Bulletstorm
[2:04:32] <%Agami23> theres developers still stuck in the 7th gen, like bethesda
[2:04:34] <+dante_must_die_exe> YE
[2:04:35] <@Ranryu692> remember Outriders?
[2:04:35] <VirtuaRailith> Bulletstorm rules
[2:04:35] <+pectusumbra> that would also be the Wii wouldn't it? At the very least Muramasa is amazing
[2:04:35] <%vapelad_dabberb01> god bulletstorm is so unfunny
[2:04:36] <comicalmond> the yakuza series
[2:04:37] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> His dick though
[2:04:39] <+FoolsArcade> FANTASTIC game
[2:04:39] <ammobasket> Hell yeah
[2:04:39] <%stubborndeer> @Bogart4321 It was a 250 round box of 7.62 Belt fed ammunition on my screen
[2:04:41] <%RayReborne> i need to play bulletstorm now i guess lol
[2:04:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> I've really only ever heard positive things
[2:04:42] <%Monkeyweed21> "WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?"
[2:04:42] <+KingpinLarry> @PwnyB Almost every game now comes out broken. Nothing has changed much. :(
[2:04:42] <%polothegreatest> rise of license games LUL
[2:04:43] <HotMafia81> Also the 7th gen went on for goddamn ever.  Much more likely to accumulate garbage the longer a console cycle drags on
[2:04:43] <Jaysky> I enjoy that game'
[2:04:43] <+dante_must_die_exe> kill his dick so hard
[2:04:44] <ChloeFleurage> yeah thats bullet storm
[2:04:45] <%maskofmichael> I 'member that, you 'member?
[2:04:47] <%Ne1son> By Satan's Thorny Black asshole its good
[2:04:47] <+dumemoto> Shit, I think you might be right. I have nostalgic memories blocking the fact that I was playing trash.
[2:04:48] <%lumporr> what if your dick died of old age
[2:04:49] <jorniev> DUKENUKEM DLC WAS WEIRD
[2:04:49] <televisedrevolting> FUCK YEAH BULLET STORM
[2:04:50] <ChloeFleurage> the game where you can turn a man into a ceiling fan
[2:04:52] <lloyddboy> remember the fakeout demo that shat on COD?
[2:04:53] <oda_flobunaga> The Metro Games would probably do it
[2:04:53] <%Faustgesicht> bulletstrom is so fucking stupid
[2:04:54] <ExpressNode> Just booted up Xillia on my PS3 and that game aged like milk I don't mean like cheese
[2:04:57] <Jaysky> @Ranryu692 Yes actually I'm waiting on a big sale to play with friends
[2:05:04] <KyberNasse> I liked Mario Galaxy, no dick killing there
[2:05:07] <%Bionicghost> we gotta destroy the shagohod!
[2:05:07] <munitalprats> yes
[2:05:09] <%Forbidden_Karp> I like how he specifies which Sokolov he is after
[2:05:09] <%JoshManVGH> @ranryu692 Wish I could but it only worked 3 times!
[2:05:09] <munitalprats> NO MURDER ALLOWED
[2:05:10] <+meatmaaan> remember how hard bullestorm set up a sequel Sadge
[2:05:14] <+pectusumbra> alive means not dead
[2:05:15] <EASrake> probing is optional
[2:05:17] <munitalprats> THIS IS NOT A MURDER M I S S I O N
[2:05:17] <ammobasket> Best justified use of violence and profanity
[2:05:17] <%ForrestKrump> He truly was, Dishonored.
[2:05:18] <%shurtal> Virtuous Mission
[2:05:18] <%pepzi_boyz> pepzi_boyz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Metal gear rising was 7th gen so your wrong
[2:05:19] <%Monkeyweed21> damn pat flew through the Golden Cat level
[2:05:22] <televisedrevolting> Man, Bulletstorm and Gears, I ate that shit like candy.
[2:05:22] <%Monkeyweed21> SAME
[2:05:24] <%IronOhki> @ExpressNode I hate that I turned away from my work computer, saw your name, and thought I had work on this computer as well.
[2:05:24] <coreybom> I can understand why you’ll feel that way about 7th generation, but i gotta disagree. Though it might be nostalgia cause i grew up with the 7th gen.
[2:05:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> guess we'll see the difference now
[2:05:28] <+KingpinLarry> It's the longest level.
[2:05:28] <jorniev> OH GOD THIS LEVEL
[2:05:29] <%twistedj3ster> "He's my favorite robo-pal! Ishi was ok, but he wasn't 50' tall!"
[2:05:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> is this where they introduce the tall guys?
[2:05:37] <%polothegreatest> sokolov? did u contact adam?
[2:05:46] <bosssbatttle> @ReallyBigRocks nah
[2:05:47] <AvroEltz> Now this is when difficulty ramps up for stealth
[2:05:49] <munitalprats> @ReallyBigRocks that's boyle
[2:05:52] <$batpick> Cheer1000 I wish brutal legend made a comback , that game was amazing.
[2:05:53] <+Bogart4321> guards noticing some weirdo wearing a mask on a boat
[2:05:56] <OverlordedK> Sokolov is great
[2:05:58] <%JoshManVGH> But later... when it's still dusk shit
[2:05:59] <ZilverZap> Music somewhat reminds me of Cyberpunk
[2:06:00] <%dalmek> sok a lov nutz
[2:06:02] <oda_flobunaga> MGS4, FF 13 oy
[2:06:03] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What would a Sokolov Cocktail be?
[2:06:04] <munitalprats> reminder pat, you have time STOP now
[2:06:06] <ChloeFleurage> @pepzi_boyz in metal gear rising you can bunny hop and as far as the game is concerned you're effectively invisible in stealth sections
[2:06:08] <%stubborndeer> "This is not a murder mission, but we are attempting to murder someone for no reason, which is... murder"
[2:06:11] <Jaysky> @batpick Never will due to DMCA
[2:06:11] <%miguelrod777> Samuels the best
[2:06:16] <televisedrevolting> I played so much goddamn Wii shovelware that I am generally confused as to why I still like video games.
[2:06:22] <TioXyco> everytime they say Sokolov all I can remember is MGS3
[2:06:26] <%maskofmichael> @batpick I liked it too, to bad it was a liar game
[2:06:38] <placeholder03> 7th gen nostalgia's got Bioshock and Revengance
[2:06:43] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> So how is the Dishonored playthrough going Pat?
[2:06:43] <AvroEltz> Can we sum this game's sokolov counter to the mgs 3 sokolov counter
[2:06:49] <%RayReborne> @tioxyco me too lol
[2:06:53] <%ScreamLord> Remember Force Unleashed for the Wii?
[2:06:57] <%DianaTheAscian> Shovelware was at its height back then
[2:06:59] <televisedrevolting> I was a child, but I played the fuck out of Space Camp for the Wii.
[2:07:00] <oda_flobunaga> DMC
[2:07:02] <%pepzi_boyz> @ChloeFleurage true, but it was still good tho
[2:07:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Video Games are weird. I've been playing Farming Sim and actually having fun
[2:07:06] <%Monkeyweed21> it was really fun being a kid and only having a wii for the first 3 or 4 years of the 7th gen
[2:07:09] <%RayReborne> We gotta stop the Shagohod
[2:07:17] <comicalmond> devil may cry 4
[2:07:22] <ChloeFleurage> amazing game but still fits the point of broken 7th gen games
[2:07:25] <jorniev> I REMEMBER someone said some games on the 7th generation were  EXTRA bad because games for windows live made it harder to port from and to PC
[2:07:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But Dead Space 1 and 2 tho
[2:08:00] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I think it really depends on someone's age when gen they feel is the best and the worst.
[2:08:01] <munitalprats> put him in the dumpster!
[2:08:03] <%maskofmichael> Throw him over the railing
[2:08:07] <Badgerconda_> God I fucking love the vibe in Dishonored 1.
[2:08:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> dumbstor
[2:08:13] <MyNameIsRasus> giant rats even

[2:10:01] <Mister_McDerp> sneakers = stealth boots
[2:10:10] <AvroEltz> Look at that dripping whussy oil
[2:10:11] <%dalmek> @ape_hawk goddammit LUL
[2:10:17] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Are the goblins out for blood?
[2:10:22] <+KingpinLarry> Yep
[2:10:31] <munitalprats> blink 2, yeah.
[2:10:36] <jorniev> yes
[2:10:37] <ToneBacas> you can't not have blink, can you?
[2:10:39] <%scaryboisupreme> in case you're not using powers
[2:10:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> @jorniev Fracture?
[2:10:45] <churropoppa> WHALE PUSSY
[2:10:49] <munitalprats> or you know

[2:10:56] <%Forbidden_Karp> Half-life tram level
[2:10:56] <AvroEltz> dont have blink 2 or mana to use it
[2:10:58] <thelonechris> Vrroooom
[2:10:59] <KilljoyHexx> you call play this without using powers so
[2:10:59] <privatecorgi> You can refuse the outsiders powers cant you
[2:11:01] <+dmbender> its fun swapping from Woolie fighting for his life in Dread, to seeing Pat playing in a minecart
[2:11:07] <jorniev> GOD THAT GAME LOOKED AWFULL
[2:11:10] <munitalprats> @privatecorgi only in 2
[2:11:15] <%Laecerelius> Invisiblessed
[2:11:20] <some_brave_apollo> you can almost complete the game without using blink, but there's one spot near the end of the game where you have to. dumb oversight
[2:11:22] <%DEETRz> DEETRz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 39 month streak! 
[2:11:25] <ToneBacas> you always have at least enough mana for one blink use, and it recharges
[2:11:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> @jorniev just so you know, I googled "shooter with terraforming" and it was the first result lol
[2:11:29] <jorniev> remember mindjack WHEN WAS THAT SHIT?
[2:11:47] <Komayeda> Oh hey, 3rd level already! Way to go!
[2:11:50] <LongJackSilver> hey just got here. what kind of run are we playing?
[2:11:54] <+Bogart4321> bathroom with no door awesome
[2:12:02] <kazadog> dude remember fucking HAZE?
[2:12:03] <+dante_must_die_exe> break that shit open LUL
[2:12:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @LongJackSilver anything goes, no reloading
[2:12:15] <SomeAsianDood> @LongJackSilver no restarts. Pat gameplay
[2:12:17] <some_brave_apollo> @LongJackSilver no reloading except on death
[2:12:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> @LongJackSilver Anti-mind goblin run
[2:12:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @jorniev I remember Angry Joe's review better than the game tbh
[2:12:24] <jorniev> @kazadog i dooo
[2:12:25] <Komayeda> A "Pat tries to fight the mind goblins" run
[2:12:25] <munitalprats> you can blink to chains iirc pat
[2:12:28] <SomeAsianDood> You can connect the dots for chaos levels
[2:12:38] <Komayeda> New Rewn
[2:12:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> murder all goblins
[2:12:43] <munitalprats> get possession!
[2:12:46] <LongJackSilver> oh one of those SeemsGood
[2:12:50] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Try out the World?
[2:12:52] <%SpoonheadInExile> Why is the Propaganda officer giving curfew messages for the whole city that only mention Kaldwin's Bridge?
[2:13:10] <%TheHateFish> Dark Vision is great
[2:13:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> dark vision is straight cheating
[2:13:19] <%SpoonheadInExile> His messages go throughout the whole city
[2:13:27] <Visorak6> time stop?
[2:13:28] <munitalprats> this is the perfect tme
[2:13:29] <munitalprats> to use your new power
[2:13:32] <munitalprats> or just do this
[2:13:34] <+pyrojack6> it's really hard to beat Blink when itsthe best skill you get outside the busted time power
[2:13:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt remember you have time stop
[2:13:42] <%SinnerEbru> @spoonheadinexile the psa might just be blasting along the bridge. idk i never played lmao

[2:14:12] <munitalprats> DO IT
[2:14:14] <munitalprats> USE IT
[2:14:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @pyrojack6 there's a reason the achievement for beating the game without powers doesnt count blink
[2:14:20] <privatecorgi> Were people that confused back then about the lightning bolts over guards heads
[2:14:28] <jtsoppy137> THE WORLD

[2:23:40] <%stubborndeer> BY THE BROKEN TEA BAG IT'S AN UNEATEN RAT
[2:23:40] <%rkbinder> rkbinder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Its really nice to see you enjoying this game finally
[2:23:40] <Reveresao> The Devil: Such a basic bitch.
[2:23:42] <%G_Thunders> He’s just really old and bored
[2:23:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I'm not gonna be your friend
[2:23:44] <ElSuperNova> Upgrade ?
[2:23:44] <%Laecerelius> GO FAST!
[2:23:45] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Agility
[2:23:46] <tj_timbs> agility lv2 actually
[2:23:47] <Zombrocom> Possession lets you do some stuff. After it ends it stuns them for a free choke
[2:23:48] <+pectusumbra> Aka the Nyarlathotep viewpoint. Also "NERD!"
[2:23:49] <%Forbidden_Karp> oooh that works
[2:23:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> what? rat swarm isn't very targeted? no way
[2:23:51] <mads_valentine> Yes
[2:23:52] <some_brave_apollo> agility is good
[2:23:52] <+pyrojack6> Possesion is cool, lets you get some tricky places with fish and rats
[2:23:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> it should
[2:23:53] <%Faustgesicht> yup
[2:23:54] <ElSuperNova> yes
[2:23:54] <+Peacefrog7> I think
[2:23:56] <+pectusumbra> yes
[2:23:56] <%Profmcstevie> Go fast sounds like a wild time
[2:23:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i think so
[2:23:57] <+MushyCornbread> yeee fasterer
[2:23:59] <%Forbidden_Karp> that's fair
[2:24:03] <+plsnolookatme> Pat you can combine Devouring Swarm and Possession to possess a rat, if you need one.
[2:24:03] <blackjack8182> CHAOS
[2:24:05] <%Profmcstevie> HE'S FAST, HE STABS, HE BLINK
[2:24:06] <%SpoonheadInExile> ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
[2:24:08] <%bassoontyphoon> Sanek
[2:24:08] <some_brave_apollo> pat thats reloadin
[2:24:22] <%bassoontyphoon> psaBig psaWrong
[2:24:30] <LongJackSilver> no reloading they said
[2:24:30] <+cmdrmobium> why does the pause menu sound like Squidward walking
[2:24:33] <%scaryboisupreme> giving into the goblins again I see
[2:24:40] <Zeif00> reloaded
[2:24:42] <%Cozy90> misses pipee
[2:24:45] <ElSuperNova> UNCONTROLLED EXPERIMENT
[2:24:46] <%PrimalDweeb> How long has it been since someone said Whussy? Too long? Glad I fixed that. Think of the Whussy Pat.
[2:24:47] <%SpoonheadInExile> NO RELOADING
[2:24:48] <+Bluemanzee> 4 whole Mississippis
[2:24:58] <tj_timbs> you've been duped
[2:24:59] <OverlordedK> it's your normal walk speed
[2:25:02] <ElSuperNova> you bonked
[2:25:05] <%scaryboisupreme> Incleased
[2:25:07] <%G_Thunders> Not worth
[2:25:09] <%SpoonheadInExile> This is the most imprecise thing ever LUL
[2:25:10] <+Bogart4321> the bed blocked your movement
[2:25:11] <%Forbidden_Karp> betrayal
[2:25:11] <%Cozy90> misses pih-pee
[2:25:13] <LongJackSilver> WutFace
[2:25:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> it wasnt a full 4th missisipi, that seems very negligible
[2:25:19] <%bevyrage> when you sprint?
[2:25:21] <+Bluemanzee> John Cleese'd
[2:25:22] <+pectusumbra> put on both things?
[2:25:22] <%scaryboisupreme> walking and running speed is increased
[2:25:22] <+ColonelHandzLanza> John Cleesed
[2:25:24] <Dunmarkh> Wow that's bullshit
[2:25:25] <tj_timbs> walking, running, climbing, and swimming it says
[2:25:27] <some_brave_apollo> it counts
[2:25:27] <%scaryboisupreme> YES IT DOES
[2:25:28] <Zombrocom> Guess it's for sprint
[2:25:28] <%twistedj3ster> PAT NO
[2:25:30] <+Ches_Neckbeard> counts imo
[2:25:30] <munitalprats> should've gotten possession :^)
[2:25:31] <%RayReborne> welp
[2:25:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> Movement Speed John Cleese'd
[2:25:32] <ChloeFleurage> you just pulled the crouch speed talisman off
[2:25:36] <some_brave_apollo> that counts pat
[2:25:37] <@Ranryu692> testing out upgrades doesn't count, it's fine
[2:25:39] <privatecorgi> Uncertainty is half a Mississippi
[2:25:39] <+pectusumbra> It doesn't count, chat is babies
[2:25:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> This experiment doesn't seem 100% legit.
[2:25:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no it doesn't relax
[2:25:41] <Badgerconda_> you climb and sprint faster
[2:25:42] <ChloeFleurage> your control was with it on pat
[2:25:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt it makes climbing animations faster too
[2:25:46] <@commanderclaw> It's basically pushing a respec button
[2:25:49] <TioXyco> why is pat counting mississipis, that's not a canadian count
[2:25:49] <%bassoontyphoon> psaBig psaBig psaBig psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:25:49] <%G_Thunders> Get a fun ability
[2:25:49] <%lumporr> does not count
[2:25:51] <+Bogart4321> its fine lol
[2:25:52] <tj_timbs> i say possession
[2:25:53] <%maskofmichael> psaGoblin win
[2:25:53] <+Ches_Neckbeard> that counts Pat. You're optimizing
[2:25:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> I don't wanna relax
[2:25:55] <mrblack499> it dose
[2:25:55] <%lumporr> pretext of an experiment
[2:25:55] <%TheHateFish> Get Dark Vision you nerd
[2:25:56] <JetpackMcQuack> reload for science
[2:25:57] <+pyrojack6> Possess some rats yeah boi
[2:26:00] <%bevyrage> pat it literally says walking, climbing, and swim speed increased. it doesn't say crouching
[2:26:04] <%Profmcstevie> Respec panic is a goblin too Pat
[2:26:04] <some_brave_apollo> this game doesn't have a respec button
[2:26:05] <%PrimalDweeb> I agree with Pat.
[2:26:05] <+pectusumbra> dark vision or possession
[2:26:06] <+plsnolookatme> It increases Running, Climbing, and Swimming
[2:26:09] <munitalprats> there have been multple spots to use them
[2:26:10] <%Ne1son> SWARM
[2:26:15] <jman13131313> IT dose
[2:26:16] <munitalprats> you've just stabbed the rats
[2:26:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> high standards for rats huh?
[2:26:18] <Dunmarkh> That ability was dogshit, good reload
[2:26:19] <+RedKazoo> they cant swim anyway
[2:26:20] <%SovPho> those pathways don't show up until later anyways
[2:26:20] <Mister_McDerp> jermaRat
[2:26:20] <Zombrocom> There has been a few
[2:26:20] <%lumporr> @bevyrage it also says "overall movement speed"
[2:26:20] <%Mr_Pylon> He should be counting Mississaugas
[2:26:21] <@commanderclaw> It lets you get through vents
[2:26:22] <%SovPho> possession is shit
[2:26:24] <+pectusumbra> possession is mainly good since it's also a TP
[2:26:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> these rats not good enough for ya
[2:26:29] <Zombrocom> Level 2 also works on humans which is always useful
[2:26:30] <+BcMurgen> it works on fish too
[2:26:30] <tj_timbs> you know what sucks about possession actually, is that knowing that there's always a way to progress WITHOUT using possession
[2:26:33] <Gwyndellyn> game was not designed for possession, it's a gimmick
[2:26:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> then do it
[2:26:34] <munitalprats> it lets you get through vents.
[2:26:39] <munitalprats> and you do teleport to the target.
[2:26:42] <%bassoontyphoon> Possession is ok but overall meh
[2:26:42] <%InternetShis> Plus they swim so they're not rats
[2:26:43] <ElSuperNova> ya
[2:26:44] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt Windblast is also pretty good for getting through certain walls later
[2:26:45] <3viltiki> second shadow kill is baller
[2:26:47] <@commanderclaw> You teleport to the dude you possess
[2:26:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt it makes climbing animations faster in addition to running and swimming
[2:26:57] <+plsnolookatme> Pat don't listen to them Possession's cast range is less than a lvl 1 Blink.
[2:26:59] <Badgerconda_> possession is super powerful, what are you guys talking about?
[2:27:07] <%SovPho> It can get you through some shit
[2:27:07] <lloyddboy> YEET
[2:27:14] <Dunmarkh> fus ro dah?
[2:27:16] <@commanderclaw> Level 1 doesn't kill easily
[2:27:17] <LongJackSilver> the jedi way
[2:27:17] <tj_timbs> windblast seems like a non-stealth centric power
[2:27:17] <%Monkeyweed21> can break doors
[2:27:17] <+Faultlined> I mean Darkvision is legit
[2:27:18] <munitalprats> its very lethal
[2:27:20] <+Bluemanzee> You don't want Force Push?
[2:27:22] <ElSuperNova> doubt
[2:27:23] <%bevyrage> @lumporr "overall" means generally everything, or mostly everything, or even at least 'most'. none of these are 'everything' or 'all'
[2:27:25] <some_brave_apollo> shadow kill only works when you kill the enemies though and you're only doing that when they see you
[2:27:26] <%Profmcstevie> It'd be fuunnny to blow people around
[2:27:32] <%SovPho> bet
[2:27:35] <%bassoontyphoon> Shatter doors is great
[2:27:36] <+plsnolookatme> You can also just shoot doors with your gun, it breaks them just the same. Wooden doors.
[2:27:38] <tj_timbs> it's good for opening certain doors i guess
[2:27:38] <%TheHateFish> Dark Vision continues to be legit useful at times, because it lets you see through walls.
[2:27:41] <@commanderclaw> It *can* kill but it's harder to do so unless you're yeeting them off cliffs
[2:27:44] <%G_Thunders> It’s Karnesis in deathloop
[2:27:44] <%Profmcstevie> Always spec into goofy jedi powers
[2:27:47] <munitalprats> its the wooden doors
[2:27:47] <mads_valentine> Plenty
[2:27:48] <OverlordedK> Shadowkill is ez mode for being compeltely silent
[2:27:49] <+pyrojack6> yeah
[2:27:50] <$Futurecity10> all wooden doors are shatterable
[2:27:50] <Badgerconda_> windblast is super fun. it can also knock projectiles back at people.
[2:27:51] <mrblack499> wind is a waste of time
[2:27:52] <+pectusumbra> honestly I'd pick dark vision but I also get if it's part of the mind goblin slaying
[2:27:52] <%SovPho> Wooden ones typically, I think some metal ones with level 2?
[2:27:56] <RogueofBlight> Ah yes, the only stealth game where using all the options nets you the bad ending.
[2:27:57] <+Ches_Neckbeard> so many people helping Pat optimize which he said he didn't want to do in Goblins series boo
[2:27:57] <PinkSocks> any non metal ones
[2:27:57] <%SveriSageAdvice> it claims all wooden doors
[2:27:57] <%Monkeyweed21> most doors can be shattered
[2:27:58] <vonpimpenstein> explain your goblins when they are goblin you please
[2:28:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> I assume all the ones that don't say unbreakable
[2:28:01] <+plsnolookatme> Basic wooden doors are all shatterable. With bullets, grenades, or Windblast @PatStaresAt
[2:28:08] <LongJackSilver> any door is a shatterable door if you know the ways of the Force
[2:28:09] <+pyrojack6> that thing will fuck you up
[2:28:09] <%Logoth_> What's that? Touch the charger?
[2:28:21] <%Forbidden_Karp> damn tesla towers

[2:36:54] <munitalprats> or you just fucked it
[2:37:00] <ToneBacas> i prefer the way they do mana in Death of the Outsider; your mana refills all the way, so you're free to experiment with your powers without having to worry about chugging potions
[2:37:05] <%Logoth_> my spleeen
[2:37:12] <+DynDimAcsiwn> you can blink to a ledge or something but not straight down

[2:50:23] <tolloponik> they are British What else are they suppose to do!
[2:50:26] <%DianaTheAscian> Its not like you they have much to do
[2:50:38] <%JoshManVGH> Every damn night. They have a serious problem
[2:50:42] <%CatastropheCorvid> @tolloponik Gin and ciggaretts.
[2:50:49] <%InternetShis> Thank you chat
[2:50:54] <PantsSoldSeparately> idk if this was mentioned but you can walk through walls of light with level 2 time bend
[2:50:57] <%Forbidden_Karp> plz halp
[2:51:01] <%aishman> aishman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! Kill them all Pat. Kill all the mind goblins. Also I've officially now lost over 50 pounds since being diagnosed with diabetes, that's like almost one Zangief.
[2:51:04] <@Ranryu692> helper? I hardly know her
[2:51:06] <SiameseSneeze> push her
[2:51:18] <bippityjones> Time to get snacking
[2:51:23] <%SpoonheadInExile> At least this game whispers at you that you're a bad person for committing wanton murder. Undertale shames you for engaging in self defense against creatures who attack you first
[2:51:30] <bippityjones> The body is in the way
[2:51:31] <huskarl_zap> skaven
[2:51:38] <+RyanTheRecluse> I had to give up on trying a no kill run in dishonored 2. Some of later enemies just die when you tranq them and it was a huge pain I'm the ass getting to the end and seeing like 2 people had just died..
[2:51:39] <JetpackMcQuack> knife it is
[2:51:46] <+MushyCornbread> those some serious rats
[2:51:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> stab rat
[2:51:49] <+DynDimAcsiwn> wait that fucking works????
[2:51:49] <%Dakuu75> just swim, lady. They won't be able to follow you
[2:51:50] <+KingpinLarry> you could've set them on fire too
[2:51:51] <%maskofmichael> KILL THEM ALL PETER
[2:51:53] <+Bogart4321> those poor rats
[2:51:54] <%Ne1son> They will return, and in greater numbers
[2:51:54] <%Laecerelius> The pasta rat defeats the smaller rats
[2:51:58] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> has Pat ever streamed Prey??
[2:52:03] <kazadaz> Sorry i destroyed your husband's body
[2:52:03] <+ThomasOfTroy> Now kill her
[2:52:04] <%Forbidden_Karp> much rat
[2:52:06] <%CatastropheCorvid> @RyanTheRecluse I managed it, but it took so many quick saves/loads.
[2:52:07] <tj_timbs> rato
[2:52:07] <jorniev> yaaaay
[2:52:09] <Blu_C> They gave you a grenade for that... but knife it is.
[2:52:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> 30-50 feral rats
[2:52:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> @BlowFireThroatTotem A few streams, yeah
[2:52:16] <LongJackSilver> where's the rat authority?
[2:52:17] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I think this woman is just dead on high chaos.
[2:52:18] <%InternetShis> Ratatwoie
[2:52:20] <tanarath> Rats, rats, we're the rats.
[2:52:21] <%Valdorick> SUMMON RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS
[2:52:21] <+blkalucard1> you must die!
[2:52:22] <SiameseSneeze> girl, you just saw this man teleport
[2:52:23] <%Dakuu75> wwhy was SHE down here?
[2:52:24] <+wumpy3d> Rat Wizard?
[2:52:32] <%CatastropheCorvid> Oh that voice actress is Desdemona/ dragonSkyrimLady
[2:52:34] <%InternetShis> Lady get
[2:52:34] <%JoshManVGH> Bone charm
[2:52:36] <ManfredA> you got sick lore
[2:52:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> woah is that game of thrones
[2:52:51] <tolloponik> you got the thank and favor of a dame what else dose a Gentleman need
[2:52:57] <+ThomasOfTroy> Eh
[2:52:58] <tj_timbs> kind of?
[2:52:58] <%Forbidden_Karp> long run up at least
[2:53:01] <PinkSocks> a little bit
[2:53:02] <some_brave_apollo> I don't think so
[2:53:04] <%SveriSageAdvice> compared to the first ones, yeah
[2:53:05] <jorniev> yes
[2:53:07] <%bevyrage> most missions after the first zone feel too long
[2:53:09] <@Ranryu692> eh?
[2:53:10] <+KingpinLarry> this and flood district are pretty long
[2:53:12] <Heyestus> @patstaresat how's it feel to do your first actually good deed and save someone?
[2:53:12] <xeros720> yeah, just a lot of optional stuff
[2:53:19] <+pectusumbra> Wouldn't surprise me if there weren't ways to cut it short
[2:53:19] <mrblack499> no its not
[2:53:20] <@Ranryu692> maybe it's just that it's a long corridor, rather than a wide area?
[2:53:20] <tanarath> It's a two-parter
[2:53:21] <bippityjones> Can't read shit with these quick load times
[2:53:21] <silverira> a bit yeah
[2:53:22] <%skeletonmilk> is there a mod for this game that reduces everyone's hand size by 70%?
[2:53:22] <Zombrocom> It's... a long line shape I guess?
[2:53:23] <%JoshManVGH> A little bit yeah. They chain together.
[2:53:24] <tj_timbs> mission 7 is by FAR the longest
[2:53:25] <%G_Thunders> If you had killed more people no
[2:53:28] <kazadaz> I love the instinctual move to get the fuck off street level
[2:53:33] <+RyanTheRecluse> @catastrophecorvid I persisted until the museum mission, after my umpteenth quickload I just gave up.
[2:53:36] <Zombrocom> It takes about 1 minute to speedrun it
[2:53:44] <%CatastropheCorvid> @skeletonmilk And ears and nose?
[2:53:54] <@Ranryu692> ye
[2:54:01] <%CatastropheCorvid> @RyanTheRecluse I don't blame you. The museum mission was ridiculous.
[2:54:03] <tj_timbs> yeah but can't you swing at it
[2:54:05] <bippityjones> Just jump & smack
[2:54:06] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt  just shoot it
[2:54:07] <xeros720> bang bang
[2:54:07] <mads_valentine> Shoot it
[2:54:09] <LeotheHuntsman> or shoot
[2:54:09] <tj_timbs> oh i see
[2:54:11] <mrblack499> use gun
[2:54:11] <%Laecerelius> Jump and slap?
[2:54:12] <LongJackSilver> or you know... shoot
[2:54:13] <bippityjones> or burn it
[2:54:16] <%shurtal> nope
[2:54:17] <+pectusumbra> explosive bolt?
[2:54:22] <tanarath> No, there are others
[2:54:22] <jorniev> OR BOMBS
[2:54:26] <%JoshManVGH> wa you can just thump it
[2:54:27] <SomeAsianDood> Smart
[2:54:32] <%JoshManVGH> got there
[2:54:35] <$SirGO0SE> sup gang? woolie went fucking hard today at being streamer man
[2:54:35] <bippityjones> or LAMP OIL
[2:54:48] <%JoshManVGH> Windblast can be used on doors.
[2:54:48] <jtsoppy137> Tombstone
[2:54:50] <huskarl_zap> ROPE
[2:54:51] <mads_valentine> Yes, unconcious as well!
[2:54:54] <tj_timbs> the answer is no, no we don't
[2:54:54] <%CatastropheCorvid> IIRC it's all bodies.
[2:54:57] <Treasure_Vault> Pat might have a real big stream infront of him tomorrow
[2:54:58] <%maenos2> OOOH UNDERTAKER
[2:55:02] <%Profmcstevie> I erase the bodies, I am magic corvo
[2:55:02] <bippityjones> Man this neighborhood SUCKS
[2:55:04] <sirrice77> @SirGO0SE what do you mean
[2:55:04] <@Ranryu692> I *think* in Dishonored 2 you can pick up coins in groups, rather than all individually
[2:55:12] <jorniev> WIND BLAST its for combat or trowing granades at indiscriminate  heights during time stop
[2:55:15] <+KennyKRool> Down with the sickness? I love disturbed
[2:55:15] <Zombrocom> Down With The Sickness
[2:55:16] <Heyestus> Any body, live or dead @patstaresat
[2:55:19] <%Agami23> lookit that spinny thing. i love it.
[2:55:20] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE went almost 9 hrs
[2:55:23] <kazadaz> So I know you're not reloading, but what's the policy on murder?
[2:55:25] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Ranryu692 Items in general IIRC
[2:55:25] <+DeadManProp> Hi, Pat. Are you Dishonored?
[2:55:28] <JetpackMcQuack> uh oh, we got a thinker
[2:55:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT
[2:55:34] <+RatherUninteresting> @sirgo0se how does dread look? i dont even own a switch so i didnt watch. makes me too sad
[2:55:35] <bippityjones> 420
[2:55:35] <Treasure_Vault> Woolie just finished streaming, he thought he was nearly done with the game when he started 9 hours ago
[2:55:40] <xeros720> was pat ever honored?
[2:55:41] <%Profmcstevie> D-DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS naroAAAAA
[2:55:44] <%Laecerelius> Get up and get down with the sickness, Corvo!

[2:55:58] <%SirGO0SE> @RatherUninteresting really really good. visually timeless for sure
[2:56:01] <ManfredA> @RatherUninteresting A lot of people are calling it the best 2D Metroid
[2:56:01] <%maenos2> LUL
[2:56:02] <+OG_M_Bison> 420 didn't work????????????????????
[2:56:04] <xeros720> 867
[2:56:04] <jorniev> the guy downstairs knows
[2:56:05] <+OG_M_Bison> What??????????????
[2:56:07] <%skeletonmilk> ONE CONVERSATION AT A TIME I'M FUCKING MINDFLOODED
[2:56:09] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I heard pigs go feral when you release them into the wild
[2:56:10] <%G_Thunders> Well that guy should die
[2:56:14] <%JoshManVGH> In case you wondered if evil was infectious
[2:56:17] <JetpackMcQuack> nothing in that safe that we care about then
[2:56:29] <+RatherUninteresting> @manfreda cool, ima just kill myself than.
[2:56:30] <bippityjones> Guard| "Y'know, just dehumanize these human test subjects, they're pigs now."
[2:56:32] <+vaderxyz1970> KILL
[2:56:32] <@Ranryu692> so why did you have to do the rest of the level?
[2:56:38] <%CatastropheCorvid> @BlowFireThroatTotem Aren't wild animals all technically feral by definition?
[2:56:47] <jorniev> you can get in by swiming too
[2:56:48] <@Ranryu692> if Samuel could've just brought you to Sokorov's front door
[2:56:59] <@Ranryu692> oh right, the spotlights
[2:57:04] <JetpackMcQuack> the piano hates this
[2:57:08] <+vaderxyz1970> get rid of the body in the wall
[2:57:09] <ohno778> lol sokolov
[2:57:11] <kazadaz> If I were a guard I would simply run towards the sound of the harpsichord
[2:57:19] <%Laecerelius> Whoosh!
[2:57:21] <bippityjones> Actual Stormtrooper Masks
[2:57:24] <%Forbidden_Karp> 2/3 ain't bad
[2:57:26] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I heard domesticated* pigs go feral when you release them into the wild
[2:57:27] <%DianaTheAscian> shhhhh
[2:57:31] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa  Pat noooo
[2:57:42] <tj_timbs> "nearby" you mean RIGHT ABOVE US
[2:57:48] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> like, they turn into boars
[2:57:54] <+OG_M_Bison> What do you mean the code's not 420????
[2:57:55] <%CatastropheCorvid> Desdemona/SkyrimBlades lady again.
[2:57:56] <jorniev> YAY
[2:57:57] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> That's still nearby
[2:57:57] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah nearby
[2:57:59] <%Profmcstevie> .....She isn't good with geography
[2:58:01] <Blu_C> She was technically correct.
[2:58:01] <scrumbotime> not everyone thinks in terms of Big Ups
[2:58:02] <+TheSaintJohn> sounds pretty nearby to me LUL
[2:58:02] <+OG_M_Bison> VapeNation
[2:58:04] <Treasure_Vault> Hey, it was written before the level was designed, probably
[2:58:05] <huskarl_zap> voice lines finished before level design
[2:58:05] <Blu_C> Which is the best kind of correct.
[2:58:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Can you turn it back on after she tells you the code
[2:58:10] <%SirGO0SE> coin keep
[2:58:11] <+KaguraRaion> Cash
[2:58:13] <%Forbidden_Karp> let the record show that safe locks have '0's
[2:58:25] <+pyrojack6> put the guards in the cage
[2:58:26] <xeros720> i'd throw them into the cell
[2:58:30] <+Pixel_Matt> rooD
[2:58:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Corvo is assassinating people while carrying around LITERAL GOLD BRICKS
[2:58:33] <ZilverZap> D:
[2:58:38] <%CatastropheCorvid> LOL
[2:58:39] <%InternetShis> Cage time
[2:58:42] <+pyrojack6> you have to rewire it
[2:58:44] <xeros720> honk honk
[2:58:50] <%InternetShis> Lol
[2:58:50] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Check your DMs; I found another soft lock in Lost Judgement
[2:58:57] <Parapattern> Horny Jail
[2:59:06] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I wish his name was Corbo instead of Corvo.
[2:59:11] <%CatastropheCorvid> Oh right! You have the rewire that cage, @PatStaresAt
[2:59:32] <%ScreamLord> So do kills that reduce bodies to ash count towards Chaos? Cuz there's nothing for the rats to feed on
[2:59:32] <+r4ndom_villan> i just got back is pat still feeling good this time
[2:59:36] <%SinnerEbru> LUL
[2:59:37] <%SirGO0SE> yeah i was gonna say you seem like youre having a good time haha
[2:59:38] <%Forbidden_Karp> what is the chaos system, exactly?
[2:59:38] <%Profmcstevie> Live free, just not too free
[2:59:40] <%trackles_64> Just kill the Chaos
[2:59:41] <+KennyKRool> I could see that. I never cared about the chaos system. I just ignored it entirely
[2:59:57] <JetpackMcQuack> big fan of knowing the rules to my video game
[2:59:57] <OverlordedK> I'm glad Pat's enjoying it, dishonored + 2 some of my fav games
[2:59:59] <@commanderclaw> Cause he's rich
[3:00:02] <%Valdorick> Rich asshole, that's why.
[3:00:03] <huskarl_zap> quirky
[3:00:04] <%Laecerelius> Because he's a psycho who wants to get down with the devil?
[3:00:06] <@Ranryu692> he's "eccentric"
[3:00:10] <+Bogart4321> screams are good
[3:00:15] <bippityjones> This is his Laboratory
[3:00:16] <%Valdorick> Its a Werehouse.
[3:00:17] <+pyrojack6> Scale of 1 to 10 how much of an improvement
[3:00:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> Sokolov's Ware-house
[3:00:21] <+tempestzephyr> he's british
[3:00:27] <%ScreamLord> @Forbidden_Karp the more you kill the shittier the city gets and the worse the plague giving you the bad ending
[3:00:30] <jorniev> I THINK you can also get in the house by swiming in the river
[3:00:31] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Music box Overseers are my favorite Overseers.
[3:00:31] <Parapattern> Man Sokolov gets off way too easy in low Chaos mode
[3:00:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I just instinctively super stealthed it, but that means that like 2 or three random corpses never really messed up the overall level
[3:00:33] <ohno778> His work on the shagohod
[3:00:40] <Ariddic> not even the cleaning help is safe
[3:00:40] <+Bogart4321> i think she liked it
[3:00:44] <%Forbidden_Karp> @ScreamLord thanks!
[3:00:55] <%SirGO0SE> ooo i remember this room.
[3:00:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> There are people who live in shipping containers changing a warehouse into a house isn't that much of a stretch
[3:01:14] <%Logoth_> Choke out a maid and then eat their food
[3:01:14] <+Pixel_Matt> rooD Patrick!
[3:01:15] <%Laecerelius> Good thing that stove was off
[3:01:17] <%Profmcstevie> Yes Pat, leave his house dusty and snack free
[3:01:17] <%CatastropheCorvid> @doc_ock_rokc Those people are usually homeless though.
[3:01:19] <ohno778> sleepin on job
[3:01:19] <bippityjones> Just hack that wall
[3:01:21] <JetpackMcQuack> you're on break
[3:01:25] <+Urgotfantasy> UH OH
[3:01:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's weirder that he built a house inside the warehouse tho
[3:01:29] <%Forbidden_Karp> pants are fine and all but do skirts even exist in this universe?
[3:01:30] <%InternetShis> So adding in my strawpoll votes, it's 9 for tomboy nord, and a 3 way tie for second with all three other options with three votes each.
[3:01:31] <%Puhff> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind

[3:01:45] <Ariddic> those guards have 0 side vision
[3:01:50] <jorniev> it is faster
[3:01:51] <@commanderclaw> "Shh, shh, it'll be okay"
[3:01:52] <+Bogart4321> nothing to worry about forever
[3:01:55] <%Logoth_> Video game guards have no peripheral vision
[3:02:01] <%InternetShis> It's Fine
[3:02:03] <tanarath> It's the minion helmets
[3:02:06] <OverlordedK> not his place to judge a maid sleeping on an oven LUL
[3:02:06] <%InternetShis> psaBig Fine
[3:02:07] <%SirGO0SE> they all have horse blinders on, its in the lore :)
[3:02:07] <%notsoy> you'd have to kill at least 15 more to cause problems
[3:02:12] <%maskofmichael> Kill them all Pat, Kill Them All!
[3:02:23] <%walternatorz> is that a painting on the wall there?
[3:02:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CatastropheCorvid No they are not they are usually fucking rich people that convert shipping containers into houses
[3:02:24] <jorniev> down in the basement
[3:02:37] <%Valdorick> Kill 'em kill 'em kill em all, come on Pat, it won't take that long.
[3:02:40] <+RatherUninteresting> @maskofmichael the great uncle ben head
[3:02:49] <@Ranryu692> @doc_ock_rokc they're so rich that the light seems to bend around them

[3:03:57] <ZilverZap> THE WORRRLDO
[3:03:58] <jorniev> THIS POWER IS BUSTED
[3:03:59] <%Forbidden_Karp> surely it is the wind
[3:04:01] <Ariddic> basement wind
[3:04:03] <%Profmcstevie> the wind psaSmug
[3:04:07] <jtsoppy137> pat's world
[3:04:07] <bippityjones> Nobody will notice 300$ missing
[3:04:08] <%Valdorick> The wind just made you see the figure of a man, that's right.
[3:04:08] <%JoshManVGH> Now you're thinking with Time Stop
[3:04:09] <%Profmcstevie> that dang painting stealing wind
[3:04:09] <%InternetShis> Time will resume
[3:04:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> warehouse currents
[3:04:19] <%SirGO0SE> being dio kicks ass
[3:04:22] <%InternetShis> [PAT]
[3:04:23] <%walternatorz> Pat is a phantom thief
[3:04:24] <%bassoontyphoon> Whussy breeze just blew rheough
[3:04:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt If you could have one power from this game which one would you take?
[3:04:28] <zard9> I'm SO glad they put in time stop.
[3:04:31] <%Laecerelius> very drafty
[3:04:37] <%captain_thickthighs> he knows he can use powers while using time stop right
[3:04:43] <@Ranryu692> 8 seconds of time stop is awesome
[3:04:44] <xeros720> seriously
[3:04:44] <privatecorgi> Not shadow kill?
[3:04:44] <%Valdorick> Double jump
[3:04:47] <%InternetShis> Time powers are always OP
[3:04:49] <HotMafia81> But blink tho
[3:04:50] <%MugenSandan> it's always time stop
[3:04:50] <bleugh> time stop from god of war
[3:04:51] <@Ranryu692> though blink is pretty awesome too
[3:04:52] <%Monkeyweed21> what about posession tho
[3:04:56] <jorniev> WHAT IF YOU COULD HAVE 2
[3:04:56] <%DEETRz> i dunno blink is pretty amazing
[3:04:57] <+pectusumbra> I mean blink is pretty nice as well
[3:04:58] <%notsoy> if timestop is on the table in any powers discussion, you take timestop
[3:04:58] <Visorak6> time stop and dart choke, ez
[3:05:00] <+RatherUninteresting> fuck time stop TELEPORT ME MOTHERFUCKER
[3:05:00] <$Futurecity10> Nah I'd take blink
[3:05:00] <%Forbidden_Karp> time stop would be handy
[3:05:02] <Parapattern> You can go on the ceiling lamps, can't you?
[3:05:02] <%DashXero> Timestop is the best power there could ever be.
[3:05:05] <%MugenSandan> When do you ever NOT take Time Stop
[3:05:05] <Zombrocom> I dunno, blink though
[3:05:06] <xeros720> you get good enough with time stop, it does all those
[3:05:08] <%Valdorick> Summon Rats
[3:05:10] <+Urgotfantasy> I'd probably take blink so I stop missing the fucking bus on campus
[3:05:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> Time stop might as well be a teleport
[3:05:15] <Dio_TR> Pat but you barely got out and walk, why would you need time stop
[3:05:15] <ChloeFleurage> if you get a choice of any power and time stop is an option, and you Don't take time stop you're dumb to be fair
[3:05:15] <%InternetShis> Would you rather have The World or THE WORLD
[3:05:15] <some_brave_apollo> what did he do
[3:05:15] <%Valdorick> Become the rad king
[3:05:16] <+KennyKRool> Isn't time stop just Blink but with better features?
[3:05:16] <ZilverZap> Blink requires you to think, Time Stop does not. Pretty obvious
[3:05:17] <%SirGO0SE> blink is pretty great but functionally to everyone else 1 second of time stop is the same
[3:05:18] <ManfredA> @Ranryu692 if you think about it Time Stop is just blink with extra steps
[3:05:22] <%Laecerelius> So why all the murder now, Pat?
[3:05:24] <%JoshManVGH> But Time Stop isn't Age Stop. Seems like it could be dangerous to overuse
[3:05:24] <%bassoontyphoon> The power to turn anything I pick up into instant cash

[3:05:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @bassoontyphoon careful there midas
[3:05:46] <%ScreamLord> Time Stop, Blink, and Possession are the only reasonable choices
[3:05:46] <%InternetShis> Pat is the Rat that makes all of da rules
[3:05:49] <%Valdorick> You gotta think about it like this though... Time Stop will get people to notice.
[3:05:57] <%Valdorick> And then Russian hitmen headshot you in your sleep.
[3:05:59] <%Forbidden_Karp> is that...

[3:33:38] <%SaiyanShoto> Immersive Sim? How about you Immerse yourself in some whussy?
[3:33:41] <%Profmcstevie> It asks of you, unlike any metroid before
[3:33:48] <$realm_forge> @bassoontyphoon it’s a guilty pleasure
[3:33:51] <%TheHateFish> @ReallyBigRocks Nah, it's an immersive scam. That took more of my money I'm willing to admit
[3:34:30] <KnivesEve> no its a great idea

[3:35:14] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Oh wait really? Shit?
[3:35:17] <+cubbywolf> poor doggo. It's hard to get old
[3:35:20] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Fuck me then

[3:36:17] <+cubbywolf> the light!
[3:36:17] <%Cozy90> @cubbywolf oh for sure. i imagine they can fix bugs over time but if they fuck up the classes early on it can just make the game really unfun for a long time
