[0:52:43] <%Mothman742> @angriestpat how about u hit 5,4 first
[0:52:44] <+Blankets_and_Tea> @GarbageNirvana they're specially designed to penetrate tanks and shit
[0:52:45] <PSI_Guy95> they shoot things and not people?
[0:52:45] <%Estuko> Translator's note: Placenta means plan
[0:52:47] <dekkitout> The material in question is a friggin tank
[0:52:47] <indig0bird> Wait no
[0:52:49] <%sugewin> I'm so stupid.
[0:52:50] <%alexandrecau> they shoot robots and tanks
[0:52:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> nah gary vault is fallout 3
[0:52:50] <%connos_livereview> becuase they are good at blowing shit up
[0:52:51] <$Tuskor13> They're tank missiles essentially
[0:52:52] <%lewdskeletor13> they’re against material
[0:52:53] <indig0bird> I'm drunk, lol
[0:52:53] <+TastySammiches> anti-material means it's designed to go through metal instead of meat
[0:52:54] <%RCtiger0> Placentoids
[0:52:57] <%ElenaManetta> I'm surprised you remember their Vault numbers and don't just call them like Friends episodes. "The one where they elect a sacrifice every few months"
[0:52:57] <BunnyEmperor> Anti Placenta Rifle?
[0:52:59] <ShichiNoBushi> It is anti anything that is made of material.

[0:53:10] <%VioletHeart> Also casual reminder it's anti-materiel, not anti-material.
[0:53:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> An Anti-personnel rifle will kill a person. An anti-personnel rifle is a warcrime
[0:53:12] <$Brother_Coduss> Did the math, pat's carrying 500 pounds of bottlecaps
[0:53:12] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Show us you're anti-hair rifle.
[0:53:13] <talisign> @BunnyEmperor That what Vergil uses

[0:53:17] <%Rorinator> Did that stripper just sink in to the ground?
[0:53:20] <+ahegotrigger> yeah anti material is for anti armor
[0:53:20] <+d00msdaydan> materiel =/= material
[0:53:20] <@JustinianKnight> But what about...Anti-Rifle-Rifles
[0:53:20] <BunnyEmperor> LUL
[0:53:21] <%mayorrev> yor mom's a material
[0:53:23] <indig0bird> @talisign beat me to it

[0:53:34] <+thatother1dude> Anti-tank rifles are actually different.
[0:53:37] <%MakotoPB> meat bag guns are not antimaterial

[0:53:48] <+ahegotrigger> the ncr will consider you a terrorist
[0:53:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> FUN FACT the way they work is by having JUST eough powr to go through the outer layer of armoring, and then they bounce the fuck around inside and kill the shit out of everyone
[0:53:52] <%Omegaanimus> what if there was a sniper rifle who used a person to fire long range meat bullets?
[0:53:53] <%kujofire990> hes just doing his job

[0:54:43] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat I showed him how great peace is with some good ole ultra violence
[0:54:44] <%starotter70> Good Job Pat
[0:54:44] <Fujiwara_92> PEACE IS STUPID Kappa
[0:54:44] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> No one is safe from Pat's powers of petty vengence.
[0:54:44] <%connos_livereview> 50 bmg wouldnt get through a tank they would a light vehicle tho
[0:54:44] <%FrostMass22> To be fair, Brotherhood in this game sucks

[0:54:53] <%lewdskeletor13> He deserves ot
[0:54:53] <%ElenaManetta> He was so hard-headed he refused to be headshot.
[0:54:54] <%mastertwin2> It's what Paz would want @AngriestPat
[0:54:56] <talisign> Dick shooting for peace
[0:54:57] <NachoCanDandyRavage> the king returns
[0:55:00] <%Omegaanimus> Pat, you should always aim for the dick just like Triceri-Cop
[0:55:01] <%mayorrev> :D best boy
[0:55:01] <alrobot2014> @Rawklobstah88 got and sold
[0:55:05] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I hope the Outer Worlds has a really cool pair of Six Shooters. That would be...'pretty good'
[0:55:05] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's not very stupid if it worked against someone who's supposed to be smart right?
[0:55:06] <%Rawklobstah88> Noooo
[0:55:07] <ComradeConquistador> Yeah, fuck House, but FUCK THE BROTHERHOOD.
[0:55:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> is this weird al?
[0:55:12] <%kiiiirsten> FUCK THE BROTHERHOOD!
[0:55:12] <%Rawklobstah88> I was the guy who used 9mms
[0:55:12] <%mayorrev> Yes Man is Best Man
[0:55:15] <solidsnakaus> If you do not putttttttt all of your caps on black you love mr house
[0:55:17] <%d00med_magus> everything's coming up ***
[0:55:18] <%lilytastic> what about the DLC, you can't play past the ending
[0:55:19] <%RCtiger0> So Pat, how do you feel about Anthem bricking people's PS4s? It has to be worse than Fallout 76 because of that
[0:55:19] <KangarooCyborg> The Lucky 38 is House's REAL Dick
[0:55:22] <%dooberoo> 1 cough = 1 pergaginant
[0:55:26] <Fujiwara_92> FUCK NCR
[0:55:31] <+AppleBasket> the Brotherhood are BALLERS
[0:55:34] <MrCJBubba> Veronica is a good person though
[0:55:35] <%Gray_skies1993> that's accurate
[0:55:36] <%Solidnick18> ehhh
[0:55:36] <zerocruz> Independent for life
[0:55:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> what @lilytastic you can play past the ending
[0:55:42] <solidsnakaus> Brotherhood in F03 is cool
[0:55:42] <talisign> Pat, do not say something racists
[0:55:45] <%Cavumentum> They DESERVE to be PURGED, like 90% of the rest of the Wasteland
[0:55:48] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I unironically loved the Brotherhood in 4
[0:55:50] <%dooberoo> Fuck California in general
[0:55:57] <KangarooCyborg> SEPARATELY
[0:56:00] <indig0bird> It's been like 4 games where they realize they're fucking themselves but every single time they go back to the worst possible version
[0:56:01] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Forget anybody who likes the White Glove
[0:56:02] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I liked the BoS chapter in FO3
[0:56:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> THE LEGiON MUST DIE
[0:56:06] <%alexandrecau> even the white glove?
[0:56:06] <%Mr_Strut> That's because you are a dumb
[0:56:08] <%GarbageNirvana> The Brotherhood are like WH40K Space Marines
[0:56:08] <Caidezes> Basically, Pat's a coward.
[0:56:10] <deswescappy> Fucking disgusting
[0:56:11] <%ElenaManetta> So you didn't say "yes" to Megaton.
[0:56:12] <indig0bird> @fruit_pie_the_magician For sure
[0:56:12] <$Brother_Coduss> @RCtiger0 76 resulted in people having their bank account info given out, a bit worse than bricking a system
[0:56:16] <solidsnakaus> Wait
[0:56:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Cool as shit but some of them are outright fascist
[0:56:19] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You sure they can coexist? I thought genocide is the way to go
[0:56:19] <%lilytastic> @ThatGuyfromMars I just had that problem like last month, how'd you do it? With a mod?
[0:56:19] <%spiritofmojave> Nuking legion seems a good solution to me
[0:56:20] <%starotter70> You don't know that
[0:56:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatPorgmo
[0:56:21] <solidsnakaus> You don't support nuking the whales?
[0:56:21] <theotrainwreck> Pat the philisoph
[0:56:22] <%lloyddboy> Except the Legion
[0:56:22] <%Solidnick18> elmo
[0:56:23] <%Fenlig> What about just alittle nuking?

[0:56:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> Over There Kappa
[0:56:39] <%Rawklobstah88> Yeah, teh Brotherhood isn't necessarily "good"
[0:56:39] <zerocruz> Gotta nuke the Legion tho
[0:56:41] <%kiiiirsten> him scream at own ass
[0:56:44] <JetpackMcQuack> But explosions are cool
[0:56:46] <+asgard147> he talk to the wall ghosts again. rooCult
[0:56:48] <alrobot2014> a lil nuke never hurt nobody...except when they hurt everybody
[0:56:48] <%RCtiger0> @brother_coduss Oops forgot about that
[0:56:48] <%Rawklobstah88> they're just not as bad as the legion
[0:56:55] <KangarooCyborg> 10 Nukes you won't believe what happens next! The Legion HATES it
[0:56:56] <%lewdskeletor13> You can just kill the Legion, no need to nuke them
[0:56:57] <london_flexing> Because bat problems need war crime solutions
[0:57:01] <ComradeConquistador> Btw, don't forget the Enclave quests.
[0:57:02] <$SGrim> @GarbageNirvana they're more like the Mechanicum with all the tech fetishizing mixed with facism.
[0:57:03] <%dooberoo> you should only support Nuking Land Whales....NUKE PORTLAND!!
[0:57:05] <london_flexing> bad*
[0:57:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Everybody can go ahead and keep doing their thing with Slavey McSlavenator fucking everything up
[0:57:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @lilytastic I'm confused, unless you're playing like a V1 version of New Vegas you can totally play after you finish the game
[0:57:09] <%mayorrev> god, 76 fetishized nuclear war to the extreme

[1:28:37] <%connos_livereview> and also it was kicked out early and fucked by the publisher

[2:39:42] <%kiiiirsten> @Omegaanimus Mysterious Mounties?
[2:39:42] <%TheFilth> this intense music probably isn't helping
[2:39:44] <natebud> When I got this assignment I was hoping there'd be more bumbling. Was not disappointed
[2:39:46] <Gruhunchously> Back in my day the map on the Pip Boy barely worked and you had to install a special module for it.
[2:39:47] <raj594> find the one that killed the engineer and stole his clothes
[2:39:47] <%Niney_Who> Pat that was the ONLY CLUE
[2:39:48] <Them00n> @AngriestPat You're done, you talk to the ranger now.
[2:39:48] <%OwlLightningMage> I think it's just the music getting to him LUL

[2:40:06] <%Gray_skies1993> DANGEROUS
[2:40:06] <FatherGreyBeard> Make a save, summon Kimball, see what kills him, reload, and fix the problem before it kills Kimball. Rinse and repeat until all problems go away.
[2:40:07] <+khalcipher> WTF PAT?
[2:40:11] <Gruhunchously> It's always those damn Belkans

[3:40:00] <%korth367> @AngriestPat play skyrim next
[3:40:01] <%ElenaManetta> That'll teach you to love things.
[3:40:01] <natebud> Removing that mod at the beginning might have really done it.

[3:40:02] <%PixJames> Ah my Vats are out!

[3:40:04] <%TDotGoat> Bethesda has patched spite into the game just for you.

[3:40:14] <arcaderabbit48> Im fine with that

[3:40:22] <%Gray_skies1993> yes they have
[3:40:22] <%spiritofmojave> That's okay, long as it has good quality and side content
[3:40:23] <+VaudevilleVillain93> I'm super ok with that
[3:40:25] <ape_hawk> outer worlds is gonna have hella replayability, though
[3:40:26] <callsigneagle01> We'll just wait and see then
[3:40:29] <Conky89> That is okay as long as it isn't a bug fest

[3:40:49] <HeadsHeldHigh> Ehhh
[3:40:50] <prime_name> Still waiting on that console port.
[3:40:52] <MrCJBubba> @AngriestPat The bugs are mainly because of Bethesda's shit engine
[3:40:54] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> I still want a little jank in the outer worlds tho
[3:40:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I am glad Outer Limits will be shorter

[3:41:04] <%OwlLightningMage> I still can't compete the civil war quest in Skyrim because of a game breaking bug LUL
[3:41:05] <+fragdar> say that to anthen
[3:41:06] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Deathbots incoming
[3:41:18] <%Reizie_Etherealm> They'll treat their game well, as they should
[3:41:19] <DatAsuna> Yeh Obsidin has never made a buggy game. Especially not alpha protocol
[3:41:22] <dekkitout> Two things, 1; Outer Worlds won't be Fo76. 2; Outer Worlds won't be Anthem.
[3:41:25] <Fujiwara_92> shoot torso
[3:41:25] <$ooblagis> Sentry Bots are the only legit threat in this game

[3:41:34] <arcaderabbit48> Yeah, murder robots make me miss The Legion
[3:41:38] <randomp141> @AngriestPat So how many weeks till you get your brain put into a Robobrain?
[3:41:40] <%OwlLightningMage> Sentry bots are so fucking stronk
[3:41:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Alpha protocol was fine
[3:41:41] <%AncelDeLambert> wtf I don't remember there being this many of them
[3:41:42] <%MrBorisMakarov> man this game is OUT TO GET YOU
[3:41:42] <zerocruz> Sentry bots are rad as fuck
[3:41:42] <InugamiTheHound> I wish sega would make a alpha protocol 2.

[3:42:08] <Fujiwara_92> SHOOT TORSO, NOT HEAD PAT l
[3:42:09] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh man Alpha Protocol was the shit
[3:42:09] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I think they'll be making the game more linear in the sens that side quests will open up based on story progress
[3:42:11] <+Blankets_and_Tea> i don't know if a sentry bot's head is its weak point
[3:42:23] <redsynod> No it's their back
[3:42:29] <Fujiwara_92> robots take less head damage
[3:42:31] <$nademonkey1100> if only we had gotten a pulse gun........
[3:42:50] <arcaderabbit48> @Blankets_and_Tea Its not, they have combat inhibitors in the back and you wanna go for their legs so they cant move
[3:42:57] <+PenmanLupine> you want to hit robots in the back where their Combat Inhibitors are
[3:43:02] <HeadsHeldHigh> You coulda frenzied them and made them kill each other
[3:43:05] <+Grayhammatter> we did it
[3:43:06] <Gorgen> Shiit the gun pat
[3:43:10] <callsigneagle01> drones are dead

[3:45:04] <+Breezio> Pillars or Divinity 2?
[3:45:07] <%nofestu2> pillars is boring
[3:45:07] <MrCJBubba> Gamebryo is trash
[3:45:09] <Press_X_ToJASON> pillars two is a good
[3:45:09] <%allups> yeha i was play pillers 1 with EA access
[3:45:10] <+khalcipher> New vegas never had this issues with me
[3:45:11] <%gnarly_memes_bro> will he?
[3:45:12] <$ooblagis> If you don't give a shit about these issues, but still want a good RPG, Pathfinder : Kingmaker is great LUL
[3:45:12] <NumberTooBig> @Breezio both
[3:45:15] <DracaenaLeaf> Ceaser's dead
[3:45:15] <GyroBrando> But new vegas thou
[3:45:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Would you say they are Pillars in comparison?
[3:45:16] <%spiritofmojave> Most anything is stable next to this, besides its Bethesda ''''''successors'''''
[3:45:17] <+RushUnplugged> also they don't run on a crappy 20yo engine
[3:45:18] <%Agami23> pillars? but thats not a first person shooter rpg
[3:45:18] <%Strider222> gamebryo engine is just shit
[3:45:19] <%allups> playing*
[3:45:23] <ape_hawk> and pillars 2 now has turn-based combat!!!!!!
[3:45:24] <natebud> Do you need to play Pillars 1 first?
[3:45:25] <%manwithboxonhead> DEAD
[3:45:25] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm not getting Pillars until I finish Divinity
[3:45:28] <+KabaBoBaba> I'll send the same message a month from now
[3:45:29] <%Gray_skies1993> yeah imagine what this game COULD'VE been had Bethesda not only given them 18 MONTHS to make the game and get it out
[3:45:30] <%MrBorisMakarov> wait
[3:45:32] <%cylish> Turn based is in pillars 2 and its awesome!
[3:45:32] <+Grayhammatter> gamebryo is honestly dogshit
[3:45:33] <%MrBorisMakarov> is that guys name
[3:45:34] <+Breezio> @NumberTooBig Which first? Never really played a top down RPG before
[3:45:34] <%MrBorisMakarov> for real
[3:45:36] <%ElenaManetta> I love how there are two Skelmo's on the screen in the top left right now
[3:45:37] <%spiritofmojave> Pillars is really great though
[3:45:45] <%ElenaManetta> Top RIGHT even
[3:45:48] <arcaderabbit48> Pillars 1 is a super good game too
[3:45:53] <dbgt5551> @AngriestPat It's weird that more obsidian games have been fucked up like kotor 2 or new veags than have come out working
[3:45:57] <ape_hawk> here's all you need to know about Pillars 1: FUCK DURANCE!
[3:45:59] <%bread_assassin> I want to get into PoE, but SRPGs just confuse me. I'm not good at them.
[3:46:03] <%OwlLightningMage> Pillars Zero is sick PogChamp
[3:46:03] <InugamiTheHound> pillars 1 is good does have expansion pack?
[3:46:04] <%Estuko> LUL
[3:46:06] <%Spydurman> LUL
[3:46:10] <%Gogogolem> Yeah that stream was the shit
[3:46:12] <+Mrchuckquizmo> But that most time spent
[3:46:12] <%mh9s> it was super comfy
[3:46:13] <HeadsHeldHigh> All of the factions in pillars 2 are fucking annoying
[3:46:13] <GyroBrando> It was boring
[3:46:15] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's very hard to get into
[3:46:16] <nyghtmare42> Its good. i watched it.
[3:46:17] <%Gogogolem> I remember Gun Gang
[3:46:17] <NumberTooBig> @Breezio i say pillars first since it's closer to Baulder's gate, Divinity's a lot more freeform in combat
[3:46:17] <callsigneagle01> KOTOR 2 could've been way more fucked up than it was
[3:46:18] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Tell 'em, Chuck
[3:46:20] <+KabaBoBaba> Wanna stream something that will be watched even less? A Legacy of Kain game would do that
[3:46:26] <Nina96> its like 50hrs
[3:46:30] <aimlesshealer> Pillars is fucking fun as shit
[3:46:30] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Hey pat Remember when you murdered all those pregnant women with a shotgun.
[3:46:31] <Fujiwara_92> I watched it good strem
[3:46:31] <%D_west> Chuck was a good dumb show
[3:46:35] <frogurtz> The Enclave were still pieces of shit.
[3:46:35] <%Wrashis> i will watch it on youtube just for you @AngriestPat
[3:46:37] <$ooblagis> The expansion packs are much better than the base game, which I found pretty lackluster
[3:46:38] <Gruhunchously> @callsigneagle01 Were you around before the restoration mod?
[3:46:38] <%Sovspot> you're butt hurt about your pillars lp
[3:46:39] <+Breezio> @NumberTooBig Alright, I'll give it a shot
[3:46:40] <bendatron> thanks pat we know it was a massive failure
[3:46:40] <Pookiedaexzile> We only watch for the Apex and the hot redhead
[3:46:43] <dekkitout> Gannon, where did you hide your gold! I know you got gold, fucker!
[3:46:43] <Moisthoodie> im gonna try out dark mod that thief game is it any good?
[3:46:46] <%MrBorisMakarov> EMLO
[3:46:46] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat The pillars 1 stream was awesome FeelsGoodMan
[3:46:51] <%TIME_PUNCHER> We need closure on that ending for Chuck
[3:46:54] <aimlesshealer> I'm watching your PoE stream on YT right now, it's very nice :)
[3:46:55] <callsigneagle01> @Gruhunchously was that the one that added a bunch of stuff back into KOTOR 2?
[3:46:59] <lemonman3233> Hi
[3:47:00] <AdmiralButtloaf> pillars seems like a fun game thats like golf to watch
[3:47:03] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> I wonder what kind of stuff Obsidian will make under Microsoft. More outer worlds surely but what else
[3:47:05] <arcaderabbit48> @bread_assassin Pillars 1 is probably the best crpg to start with. I've also never played one prior to that game. I can't say its very good at teaching you how things work, but there's a lot of room for customization so your party members can do their own shit.
[3:47:07] <JanusII> Hot redhead? You mean Pat, right?
[3:47:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> or watching golf
[3:47:12] <Conky89> Although the Enclave were a bunch of sleazebags, they had some of the best dialogue in the series.
[3:47:13] <callsigneagle01> reading books is fun
[3:47:15] <zamzoph> READING DansGame
[3:47:16] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Exactly like that
[3:47:20] <Gruhunchously> @callsigneagle01 Yeah, KOTOR 2 pre-restoration was BRUTALLY cut down.
[3:47:21] <+Thornarn> I love pillars so much
[3:47:22] <%FrostMass22> The amount of reading drives me nuts
[3:47:22] <NachoCanDandyRavage> that sounds great
[3:47:22] <%The_Esquana> Its sleep aid
[3:47:24] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Books are boring until you use your imagination
[3:47:25] <zerocruz> DansGame
[3:47:28] <Press_X_ToJASON> i like pillars, i also watch golf.
[3:47:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Dnd and Books...wow you're really selling this pat
[3:47:28] <%spiritofmojave> It is like reading, and it's comfy. That's what makes it so nice
[3:47:29] <%ThePuddingDead> fuck golf
[3:47:29] <%MagickBurritoh> Fun to experience but not to watch
[3:47:30] <+walnutcast> i didn't play pillars 1, i'm currently playing pillars 2. i have no idea what context i'm missing but i am definitely aware that i am missing a lot of information
[3:47:33] <callsigneagle01> @Gruhunchously I tried it and really didn't like it
[3:47:34] <Deano8817> bold of you to assume we play golf pat
[3:47:35] <ComradeConquistador> Golf is useless.
[3:47:36] <arcaderabbit48> Golf fucking sucks
[3:47:37] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Golf is just an excuse for drinkin heavily in public
[3:47:38] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Sometimes a dragon shows up
[3:47:38] <%Rellim80> Is Pillars1&2 onPS4?
[3:47:38] <$cureneckbeard> Finally I can play D&D again despite having no friends
[3:47:38] <%lloyddboy> EAT THE RICH
[3:47:39] <aimlesshealer> Pat should do a Planescape: Torment stream
[3:47:40] <%Starlight_Gamer> i hate golf
[3:47:40] <callsigneagle01> Like I can see why a lot of that was cut out
[3:47:42] <Press_X_ToJASON> golf is good
[3:47:42] <+ilasper1> pillars never topped BG2 for me but it was close
[3:47:42] <Gorgen> a golf killed my family
[3:47:43] <%MrBorisMakarov> WHAT
[3:47:44] <redsynod> I;m too young and coloured for that
[3:47:44] <%ElenaManetta> You had me until you said "buddies"
[3:47:45] <%gnarly_memes_bro> at that point i'd rather just play animal crossing, but to each their own
[3:47:45] <Fujiwara_92> GOLF IS THE BEST
[3:47:46] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat pillars is fun though golf is boring af
[3:47:46] <callsigneagle01> A lot of it was ass
[3:47:46] <%SergeEXE> I like Mario golf
[3:47:47] <+Flambage> For relaxing till the goblins tell you to min-max everything
[3:47:47] <zerocruz> Golf is trash
[3:47:48] <Pookiedaexzile> You rich bastard
[3:47:48] <arcaderabbit48> @Dr_DangerPhD Much like fishing, then
[3:47:48] <HeadsHeldHigh> golf balls in your ass
[3:47:50] <Moisthoodie> wholesome pat
[3:47:51] <dekkitout> Golf's great- mini-golf I mean
[3:47:51] <%Agami23> but golf games are fun to watch
[3:47:53] <Neo_Kaiser> pat should stream golf.
[3:47:54] <+JonnyCue> livestream golf!
[3:47:54] <derpy_platypus> Everything is relaxing until you have ti stop the president from being assassinated
[3:47:57] <%spiritofmojave> I'll take almost any sport over golf, I liked the reading analogy
[3:47:58] <%Rngiddion> do that go play golf with your dad
[3:47:58] <$cureneckbeard> lore
[3:47:59] <%Mr_y1096> one of few sports where it is acceptable to drink during
[3:47:59] <Breaburn_op> Golf is like baseball for assholes imo
[3:48:00] <%Starlight_Gamer> but mini golf
[3:48:00] <%TheShal> Patty the Caddy!!!
[3:48:01] <%ThePuddingDead> Divinity 2 has been surprisingly good, I love Fane's character out of all of em @AngriestPat
[3:48:01] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Golf is better if you use your imagination. Like "The green is lava."
[3:48:03] <callsigneagle01> Pat do a reading stream where you read us a book
[3:48:06] <NachoCanDandyRavage> Pat found dead at golf course
[3:48:07] <GyroBrando> Golf is fun just like pillars just kinda slow to watch
[3:48:08] <%shinzm1911> Pillars is ideal for a couch setup.
[3:48:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Golf is for the Bourgeoisie and we plan to eat them in the 2020 uprising
[3:48:16] <Zebroneath> I hoped Pillars 1 played better on PS4, cause there were a lot of problems with that version of the game.
[3:48:20] <$cureneckbeard> Yea play some golf with Papa Boivin. Get some fresh air
[3:48:21] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat play golf with your dad and then give us an after-action report on the podcast or something
[3:48:22] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Play DnD pat
[3:48:23] <+KabaBoBaba> Pat should stream a Legacy of Kain game
[3:48:25] <%Wrashis> i like that one arcade gold cabinet where you try to swing the ball thing as hard as you can
[3:48:25] <aimlesshealer> Golf stream when
[3:48:26] <callsigneagle01> commies can't eat anything lmao
[3:48:26] <%SergeEXE> What's Wrong with his HANDS!?
[3:48:36] <dekkitout> Ah shit! We gettin' the gang back together for one last job!
[3:48:37] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @Pookiedaexzile gamers rise up
[3:48:38] <%ElenaManetta> How the FUCK is he still a kid in their eyes. He looks like he's 37
[3:48:39] <SilverRoddo> Stadium Arcadium.
[3:48:41] <%heyitsbrian> Golf stream would be fun
[3:48:43] <Moisthoodie> @ser ITS FROM ALL THOSE BOOKS
[3:48:49] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat will you ever play metro exodus, just finish it and it was awesome
[3:48:49] <Gruhunchously> "I'm still a kid" YOUR ALMOST FOURTY ARCADE
[3:48:49] <ThatGuyThere03> so when do you fuck him?
[3:48:54] <%Gray_skies1993> @ElenaManetta good question, he is like 30-something
[3:48:55] <ComradeConquistador> Best quest in the game, right here.

[3:56:53] <omen_setter> Mortimer had fallen on hard times
[3:56:55] <%ScreamingMeat> And then Cannibal Johnson exploded.
[3:56:56] <frogurtz> That was easy.
[3:57:00] <NachoCanDandyRavage> Cannibal "Hero" Johnson
[3:57:02] <callsigneagle01> God I wish this state was less bad
[3:57:07] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Wait...did you actually think that it was the grim reaper

[3:57:44] <zebraprintbooty> How long has stream been goin?
[3:57:45] <%alexandrecau> Cool shit: Johnson got his nickname because he ate a fiend's heart as a scare tactic, he was outnumbered so he played crazy

[3:57:53] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @NachoCanDandyRavage Woolie will be his Punch Daddy
[3:57:54] <Gorgen> Reasons.
[3:57:59] <+Grayhammatter> cause he eats people, obviously
[3:57:59] <person181> he might be a vegin
[3:57:59] <%Estuko> Because he eats nothing but Ass all day.
[3:58:01] <%sshen> I wonder Pat

[3:58:22] <Roz_Lynd> i don't
[3:58:23] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Because he ripped out a mans heart and took a bite out of it to scare off a bunch of savages

[4:21:56] <%CubicPhantom> to be fair, "this is stupid" has been tonight's fucking theme
[4:22:01] <DSD24> 'I'm playing both sides, so that I can come out on top"
[4:22:01] <%Starlight_Gamer> on or for Pat?
[4:22:01] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat told the the khans to kill themselves

[4:22:19] <%spiritofmojave> If they're going to kill themselves, why not make enemies of both
[4:22:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Why did this game turn into Postal
[4:22:22] <alrobot2014> in a suicide charge do you think they're gonna care who the charge is against?

[4:22:41] <%ScreamingMeat> They either join the Legion, attack thbe dam, or fuck off
[4:22:42] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars Should I give 4 another honest effort?
[4:22:45] <Gruhunchously> They still hate the NCR, you just convinced them to not work for the Legion.
[4:22:46] <alwayspronking> Oops all murder
[4:22:50] <+Bupkis7> No they aren't!
[4:22:53] <%Ion_Laser> Karma go UP
[4:22:55] <FatherGreyBeard> Personally I like the Khans
[4:22:59] <%Gray_skies1993> are they...are they actually USING COVER!?!?
[4:23:02] <%AncelDeLambert> the Khans are pretty sane for tribals
[4:23:02] <%shinzm1911> R1 for everyone
[4:23:02] <SchroedingersFerret> Pat is the HERO
[4:23:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat leaning on the VATS system like a one legged marathon runner
[4:23:08] <Gruhunchously> @ScreamingMeat You can actually get them to help the NCR...if you kill Papa Khan and put Regin is charge.
[4:23:10] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's fine if every faction is weak then that means your faction is strong!
[4:23:10] <+ahegotrigger> LEGION GO HOME

[4:25:05] <+theAncopro> ruhroh
[4:25:05] <GyroBrando> Kill them all
[4:25:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Boomer, Genx and Milennial...Seeing as Pat didn't run around in the 90s, I'm saying he Milennial...but at least he aint a Gen Z freak like me
[4:25:05] <%kiiiirsten> I just dont give a single hot fuck about any of the factions in 4
[4:25:09] <aimlesshealer> Ravish the Legion
[4:25:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Hey guyise know what Tik Tok is
[4:25:19] <Vital_Ire> which one is gen y

[4:25:34] <%kiiiirsten> @waifoong98 exactly
[4:25:36] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Leg it to the legate pat
[4:25:36] <%Estuko> @kiiiirsten I wanted to like the Institute but they kept turning them out as the illuminati badguy boogeymen for no real reason.
[4:25:36] <NocturneNovember> *weebs
[4:25:41] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat yeah, pretty much
[4:25:46] <frogurtz> Dave Foley is the best faction.
[4:25:46] <suikudo> There is no downside to Yes man
[4:25:47] <dekkitout> Too bad the Gunners weren't a joinable faction in 4
[4:25:47] <%alexandrecau> gen y is millenial
[4:25:48] <JamvaanPS4> And then give you the choice to kill them all
[4:25:48] <Gruhunchously> I like the implication that, even if you don't kill Ceasar, he still gets blow the hell up by the army of securitrons that wake up underneath his throne room.
[4:25:49] <Eresus> like pillars 2
[4:25:50] <%kiiiirsten> @Estuko Same :(
[4:25:50] <%PalmtopNami> and then theres yes man
[4:25:53] <%Rngiddion> instill whataboutism in your fanbase regarding your factions
[4:25:55] <%PalmtopNami> and hes perfect
[4:25:58] <+genowyn> The NCR kinda sucks but the legion fucking sucks
[4:26:02] <natebud> Everyone's just strolling around down here
[4:26:03] <%Gray_skies1993> @Gruhunchously I love that bit as well
[4:26:03] <MonocleCoyote> in fallout 4 everything suck LUL
[4:26:04] <Conky89> That is why it is up to you to decide which is best.
[4:26:08] <+khalcipher> there is no downside to mr house
[4:26:09] <HeadsHeldHigh> PoE2 factions are all assholes and they all deserve to die
[4:26:09] <$alliedmastercompy> The legion sucks, they can't avoid Pat's bullets
[4:26:11] <%shinzm1911> I mean, that kind of applies to writing anything in general.
[4:26:12] <%kiiiirsten> @genowyn Which is why Yes Man Best Man
[4:26:14] <MrCJBubba> they also have to have something to like about them as well
[4:26:17] <%SmoochSpider> My power now :)
[4:26:20] <ComradeConquistador> That's why the only correct ending is Wild Card.
[4:26:21] <+Bustamente> Remeber Fallout 4 when the factions had EVERYTHING suck?
[4:26:22] <Breaburn_op> Raiders in 4 are alright
[4:26:24] <+TONYOO101> In fairness with Yes man, isnt it kinda implied that he might go awol later?
[4:26:27] <NachoCanDandyRavage> Pat "Traitor" Boivin
[4:26:37] <dekkitout> Power armor in 4- we literally just discussed this
[4:26:40] <%kiiiirsten> if you didn't side with yes Man and fuck shit up immediately on your first playthrough you got Bad End
[4:26:41] <%OwlLightningMage> The Institute had so much potential to be interesting and lives up to none of it. LUL
[4:26:42] <Gruhunchously> If you look at Ceasar's camp when you leave here, you can actually see an explosion.
[4:26:46] <CrypticMochi> It wasn’t kinda suck in 4, it was full on sandpaper suck
[4:26:48] <frogurtz> Nah Yes Man is loyal to the Courier.
[4:26:51] <Gruhunchously> It's a nice touch.
[4:26:52] <aimlesshealer> @HeadsHeldHigh I liked Aedyls, but I wasn't exactly a moral paragon in that game
[4:26:53] <%Gray_skies1993> you guys do know that Yes Man/Courier ending is only slightly better in certain ways? It's still not good overall
[4:26:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatWhat
[4:26:54] <%kiiiirsten> @OwlLightningMage See that makes me want to not beat the game at all!
[4:26:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Theres only 1 faction to join in Fall out new Vegas...the Way of the Closed Fist
[4:26:59] <+moondog_> HOLY SHIT I MISSED IT
[4:27:02] <%SilvaChariot0133> HUH!?
[4:27:03] <%kiiiirsten> Because they are the ONLY interesting ones
[4:27:07] <Gruhunchously> The Enclave come swooping in.
[4:27:08] <%Estuko> @OwlLightningMage absolutely, but all we got was badguy boogeymen we're illuminati :))))))))))))))))

[4:27:25] <FracturedImage> YEYEYEYEYE
[4:27:25] <Conky89> Isn't the big implication with Yes Man that nothing in the Mojave really changes? That is the impression I got from it.
[4:27:26] <%OwlLightningMage> @Estuko Exactly LUL
[4:27:26] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@TheSpiritof2277)
[4:27:28] <%Estuko> @kiiiirsten I beat it just to get some of the stuff endgame offered but that was kinda it.

[4:29:38] <DSD24> He has the COOLEST VOICE though
[4:29:38] <Gruhunchously> Yet when you talk to him, he's strangely eloquent.
[4:29:40] <+MrHrulgin> I think he specifically has the other 90% kill the doomed 10%.

[4:30:44] <%Gray_skies1993> @Breaburn_op yes. that's where the term "decimation" comes from

[4:47:46] <$hatesdps> big mountain? big mountain
[4:47:46] <Caidezes> Such an amazing game. Real shame it's a technical mess.
[4:47:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> maybe something happened with paige?
[4:47:50] <+hogs124> It’s a shame they made fallout 76 so bad when the other fallouts are some of the greatest games ever
[4:47:53] <waifoong98> @Gray_skies1993 now we gotta pester him to mod more Kappa
[4:48:02] <%Gray_skies1993> @waifoong98 this is true as well

[4:48:54] <DSD24> @Gruhunchously I mean kinda? they are gonna run out eventually
[4:48:55] <AlasterAngelo> Chaos Legion is on Thursday
[4:49:09] <aimlesshealer> Who is this Facebook?!
[4:49:11] <%spiritofmojave> @OwlLightningMage I tried Masquerade out a few years back, and yeah it seemed really in-depth for an RPG. Desperately aged though, in need of a rehaul
[4:49:13] <Run44forrest> wonder what mystery game s
[4:49:17] <waifoong98> Plague posted fap material for Pat? Kappa
[4:49:19] <Gruhunchously> If you side with the Legion and Ceasar is alive, the Followers are spared and allowed to leave. Not so if Ceasar dies and Lanius takes over.
[4:49:26] <LtThunderbolt> fap pat
[4:49:39] <tadaosmad> Pat take my energy GivePLZ GivePLZ GivePLZ
[4:49:47] <waifoong98> @tadaosmad LUL
[4:49:47] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Mystery game is God Eater 3
[4:49:56] <Run44forrest> no pleas e no
[4:49:57] <waifoong98> @Reizie_Etherealm LUL as if he is gonna do that
[4:50:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I know he won't
[4:50:12] <%OwlLightningMage> The mystery game is gonna be DMCV
[4:50:12] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That's just my fan fiction lol
[4:50:14] <tadaosmad> Mystery Game is DMC2 or bust
[4:50:16] <LtThunderbolt> mystery game is actually VectorMan
[4:50:20] <%Gray_skies1993> apatDab apatDab
[4:50:22] <rosemon5001> @Reizie_Etherealm lots of PLOT and FLEX TAPE in that hmhm
[4:50:24] <%spiritofmojave> I'm praying for DMC2 Infested Chopper sugoiSmugsnake
[4:50:28] <derap41> !uptime
[4:50:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 50m.
[4:50:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I love God Eater 3, too bad the game didn't do well in terms of sales
[4:50:45] <waifoong98> @TheSpiritof2277 I prefer underwater section Kappa
[4:50:46] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat will start the stream playing DMC2 and switch to 5 LUL
[4:50:50] <%sshen> Mystery game is cyber sleuth
[4:50:56] <waifoong98> @Reizie_Etherealm how bad was it?
[4:50:59] <smalls8497> guess it's time to go back to salty bet
[4:51:12] <LtThunderbolt> Mystery game is actually a mystery
[4:51:13] <NachoCanDandyRavage> I miss my digimanz
[4:51:16] <+Hugpls> Is stream over or just a break?
[4:51:16] <%Gray_skies1993> @OwlLightningMage that would be hilarious
[4:51:19] <%manwithboxonhead> This Stream will live the in memories.
[4:51:21] <tadaosmad> Mystery Game is the first english copy of Catherine 2
[4:51:22] <%spiritofmojave> @waifoong98 oh yeah, gotta love those crystaline controls and... crossbow. exactly what I think when I think devil-hunting
[4:51:24] <NachoCanDandyRavage> prolly a long break
[4:51:26] <luckycloud91> mystery game is melee
[4:51:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @waifoong98 I'm not sure we'll see another God Eater game again kind of bad
[4:51:27] <%Fenlig> DMC2?
[4:51:29] <%shinzm1911> Wasn't God Eater just a "We don't have MH on PC yet" kind of ordeal?
[4:51:32] <LtThunderbolt> lol
[4:51:35] <turf_wind_and_fire> So what happened on FB?
[4:51:43] <%ThetaFive> Mystery Game is Pat staring silently into the camera for 5 hours straight
[4:51:44] <%shinzm1911> Because I remember 2 feeling... eugh.
[4:51:47] <nzrai> but god eater started on the psp
[4:51:49] <InkyDraconian> Anyone want a banana >:?
[4:51:49] <waifoong98> @Reizie_Etherealm whoops, did they rushed content or anything?
[4:51:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @waifoong98 But they'll continue to update GE3 over time and that's good enough for me
[4:51:58] <tadaosmad> Mystery Game is the games we played along the way
[4:52:00] <Run44forrest> when i heard check facebook monkaS
[4:52:08] <+wilduus> so has pat seen the dmc5 leaks?
[4:52:15] <waifoong98> I seen dem leaks
[4:52:21] <waifoong98> man fuck that final music reeee
[4:52:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @waifoong98 I'm unsure as to why people don't like it, I suspect the lack of content but the game itself isn't bad if a little bare boned
[4:52:32] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> THAT FINAL MUSIC IS GOOD
[4:52:38] <%sshen> Please dont post leaks
[4:52:39] <%spiritofmojave> I saw someone leak something on the subreddit ://
[4:52:50] <%spiritofmojave> Cut your ISPS for the week boys
[4:52:51] <%shinzm1911> @Reizie_Etherealm Yeah, that was the feeling I got.
[4:52:52] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Can’t wait for Pat Stares At (FINAL) tomorrow
[4:52:55] <waifoong98> @Reizie_Etherealm less content than the 1st game with expansion?
[4:52:58] <Run44forrest> oh noo
[4:53:02] <NachoCanDandyRavage> WOW
[4:53:05] <%Spydurman> Snape kills Sansa
[4:53:12] <MoroseLoki> Oh

[4:53:23] <turf_wind_and_fire> @bigstupidjellyfish1337 don't even joke about that
[4:53:28] <AlasterAngelo> MK11s roster is just MK9s roster
[4:53:29] <~AngriestPat> sorry gang I got some kinda stomach thing lol
[4:53:31] <rubbishbinge> my DMC5 preload won't make it in time for launch :')
[4:53:32] <Run44forrest> last season of GoT was ResidentSleeper
[4:53:33] <Sanyle> @bigstupidjellyfish1337 still too soon man...
[4:53:38] <+MechaBaphomet> LUL
[4:53:39] <NachoCanDandyRavage> Get better pat
[4:53:41] <+Higgsworth> Don't shit your pants, Pat
[4:53:42] <%OwlLightningMage> @bigstupidjellyfish1337 Plz don't joke about that BibleThump
[4:53:43] <%MrBorisMakarov> apatHoldon
[4:53:43] <waifoong98> Whoops, toilet for too much redbull LUL
[4:53:47] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @waifoong98 Considering GE3 doesn't have any expansion at all currently. Yes, it has A LOT less content than the game with an expansion
[4:53:47] <tadaosmad> But everything is fine?
[4:53:48] <%Spydurman> shit on stream for us Pat
[4:53:49] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> I know everyone I hurt myself typing it
[4:53:55] <SteelEagleShane> Feel better Pat!
[4:53:55] <tadaosmad> >shit on stream
[4:53:56] <+wilduus> wtf happened on facebook
[4:53:58] <alcors_wisdom> its because you drink so many carbonated drinks pat
[4:54:00] <smalls8497> he shit his ass out his pants
[4:54:02] <+MechaBaphomet> Dont shit your pants tho
[4:54:03] <%Fenlig> Pat has the super farts
[4:54:07] <%ThetaFive> Mystery Game is Don't Shit Your Pants
[4:54:07] <%VanaSkiller> at least the facebook thing wasn't serious right?
[4:54:10] <AlasterAngelo> he shit himself and is livestreaming it on Facebook
[4:54:12] <%OwlLightningMage> The Red Bull is destroying Pat's ass
[4:54:20] <%Fenlig> Bring the stream into the bathroom
[4:54:21] <%shinzm1911> It sounds like a personal thing happened.
[4:54:22] <NachoCanDandyRavage> Get sleep pat. You need it after today
[4:54:27] <Run44forrest> pat said oh cool when checking his phone so im guessing nothing bad
[4:54:27] <%shinzm1911> A personal. thing.
[4:54:28] <+wilduus> Pretty sure Facebook thing gave him stomach thing
[4:54:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @OwlLightningMage I've seen that video
[4:54:29] <%Gray_skies1993> apatBig ASSPAIN
[4:54:29] <aimlesshealer> I checked Paige's twitter... I'm assuming it has to do with that
[4:54:29] <waifoong98> @Reizie_Etherealm welp that kinda sucks, because i rmb even the 2nd game without expansion has more than the first game. Well what can I expect from Bamco these days...
[4:54:57] <alcors_wisdom> if your craving cafine/sugar this late switch to like B vitamins or sports drinks like proppel it will be better for you
[4:54:59] <%Fenlig> !Colostimy bag at risk!
[4:55:27] <$RubberFistFight> Maybe people should stop demanding details of "what happened" and let pat and/or paige give out details when/if they feel comfortable doing so.
[4:55:28] <+wilduus> big ol z target over that bag
[4:55:29] <%VanaSkiller> aw shit
[4:55:52] <%KevinsLunchbox> @RubberFistFight but that would require the hivemind of the internet to be sensible and respectful
[4:55:56] <%shinzm1911> B-vitamins help you metabolize energy. You need to eat something decent with em.
[4:55:57] <%The_UnfathoMarble> Hey I gotta ask, what's the name of that song?
[4:56:08] <alcors_wisdom> hes deading to a bag if he doesnt stop drowning his large intestine with this bullshit without food
[4:56:13] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @waifoong98 The expansion for GE2 came out a year later and that has doubled the base game's content so I'm sure it'll be the same thing for GE3
[4:56:14] <%OwlLightningMage> Wheatgrass juice is also pretty good for overall health
[4:56:16] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @The_UnfathoMarble Darude- Sandstorm
[4:56:26] <%The_UnfathoMarble> Nice one :P
[4:56:28] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @waifoong98 We just need to give GE3 a year to keep coming out with more content
[4:56:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Kappa
[4:56:38] <%spiritofmojave> I always go to flax-seed in some plain ass yogurt when I get my sweet-tooth going
[4:56:46] <aimlesshealer> @The_UnfathoMarble It's called Bootloops iirc
[4:56:52] <zeroraider> He's mentally preparing himself for Dead Money
[4:56:55] <waifoong98> @Reizie_Etherealm yeah... I suppose
[4:56:56] <$RubberFistFight> @KevinsLunchbox that's a really poor excuse and you know it. If you and I are polite enough to not pry, then each and every one of the "hivemind" also possess the capacity to not pry. They've got no excuse for not using it.
[4:56:59] <%KevinsLunchbox> I wonder if Shellmo didn't gain traction because he wasn't part of this intro animation. So Shellmos failure is the fault of Voltabass
[4:57:11] <+wandorx_x> Not playing left alive?
[4:57:14] <%The_UnfathoMarble> @aimlesshealer thanks :)
[4:57:15] <Run44forrest> pat just went to pee calm down
[4:57:18] <%KevinsLunchbox> @RubberFistFight yeah but you're asking a lot of anonymous children
[4:57:30] <Caidezes> Oh no. Pat left for a bit like he always does. Something horrible must have happened! Call the mounties!
[4:57:30] <waifoong98> man I just jumped to MHW on PC, man shit is super easy compare to prev game LUL
[4:57:35] <aimlesshealer> @RubberFistFight People get curious, they get worried, and it's hard to tell how serious one should be
[4:57:40] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @The_UnfathoMarble It may be on F1NG3RS Youtube channel, link in the credits
[4:57:57] <$RubberFistFight> @aimlesshealer being curious doesn't grant someone carte blanche prying rights.
[4:57:59] <%lord_hades> how y'all doing
[4:58:08] <@PlagueOfGripes> big dumps
[4:58:11] <InkyDraconian> eaten an app;e
[4:58:12] <%khazdee> @waifoong98 any game is easier when you dont have to play it on a DS
[4:58:13] <tadaosmad> Big dumps
[4:58:14] <Run44forrest> couldve at least left the camera on so we can see the baby
[4:58:22] <%KevinsLunchbox> PlagueofGripes is here to entertain us
[4:58:25] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @waifoong98 I'm gonna do a hot take, are you ready? The bare boned story of GE3 has given me more value (in terms of story only) than the entire GE2 plus the Rage Burst expansion.
[4:58:29] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Chungus turds
[4:58:29] <waifoong98> @khazdee try me, I played 1 on PSP LUL
[4:58:30] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat needs to eat more fiber instead of none at all
[4:58:30] <%spiritofmojave> @waifoong98 yeah there's so many QoL shit that was hard to go back from World. Whetstones and mining particularly
[4:58:31] <$RubberFistFight> I'm curious too, the difference is I'm refraining from asking. The most I'll do is offer whatever moral support I can on twitter whenever they decide to say something about it.
[4:58:36] <%Elky3> rooH
[4:58:40] <alcors_wisdom> pat needs a french canadian lady to shove water up his ass again
[4:58:41] <tadaosmad> I mean, Mr House was not dumping physically for almost 89274098 year
[4:58:42] <%The_UnfathoMarble> @Breakfast_Megapowers Oh damn I'll definitly go watch it there, apatBig thanks buddy
[4:58:49] <tadaosmad> Of course he went mad
[4:58:53] <@PlagueOfGripes> jeez I forgot Cassandra Cain existed. did they ever reintroduce her
[4:58:55] <+wilduus> Plague, what are the chances of it getting drawn?
[4:58:55] <%khazdee> @waifoong98 ok how do i try you?
[4:59:02] <%Edgy_Macaroon> Pat probably fell in
[4:59:05] <rosemon5001> @PlagueOfGripes how are the pokelewds going?
[4:59:06] <waifoong98> @Reizie_Etherealm story was never thaqt strong but there were cool moments I guess
[4:59:19] <waifoong98> @khazdee should have said beats me hah
[4:59:19] <Run44forrest> left to empty his colostomy bag
[4:59:21] <DracaenaLeaf> I can't believe Pat's fucking dead.
[4:59:28] <%KevinsLunchbox> hey @PlagueOfGripes have you seen the Smug Dancing videos on youtube? Whatcha think
[4:59:28] <waifoong98> @TheSpiritof2277 true
[4:59:31] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat is now a ghost WutFace
[4:59:32] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> @plagueofgripes Cassandra Cain is back
[4:59:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @waifoong98 The existance of Phym turned it from a 4/10 to a 10/10 for me
[4:59:34] <CursedNobleman> he just fell in the loo again LUL
[4:59:37] <%Spydurman> the gout got to him
[4:59:37] <alcors_wisdom> cant believe pat fucking died live on stream
[4:59:40] <%khazdee> @waifoong98 ok so when and where do i beat you off?
[4:59:43] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @dracaenaleaf how could you not see this coming
[4:59:44] <~AngriestPat> Im sorry guys I will be back soon
[4:59:47] <tadaosmad> Cassandra Cain is HOT

[5:00:15] <smalls8497> don't forget to wipe and flush your pants
[5:00:15] <CrypticMochi> Do what you need to do
[5:00:15] <alcors_wisdom> @PlagueOfGripes nothing will ever be as bad as spoiler in batman
[5:00:17] <%manwithboxonhead> Ghost pepis nooo!

[5:01:01] <tadaosmad> Mixed reviews

[5:01:16] <%Spydurman> naw remember he's gotta shower after every shit so he might be reading this in the shower
[5:01:23] <tadaosmad> @Plague_Nurse Heard Vermintide 2 is cool
[5:01:25] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Pat's gonna drop his phone into the toilet and that'll take another hour
[5:01:29] <%ThetaFive> Gotta get that phone clean in the shower
[5:01:30] <Run44forrest> thats why hes taking so long
[5:01:33] <FracturedImage> Nick Fury loses his eye to Cpt Marvel's cat
[5:01:50] <%El_Desperad0> what
[5:01:50] <%spiritofmojave> I want to believe that
[5:01:50] <AlasterAngelo> @Plague_Nurse Total Warhammer is the quintessential Warhammer experience outside of actually playing tabletop
[5:01:53] <+cvp5127> bull
[5:01:56] <alcors_wisdom> that cant be real
[5:01:58] <waifoong98> @FracturedImage seems pointless
[5:01:58] <Run44forrest> pat put me onto showering after pooping i do it every time now
[5:01:58] <RutilusMonachus> Did pat die of Red Bull?
[5:02:05] <Them00n> How long has he been on break?
[5:02:12] <%Spydurman> like 5 mins
[5:02:14] <Run44forrest> like 5 min
[5:02:15] <%ThetaFive> Don't let Pat think about the airborne poop particles accumulating on his phone

[5:02:20] <alcors_wisdom> around 5 hours @RutilusMonachus
[5:02:20] <$spacehouse> Pat fell down the toilet
[5:02:24] <+theAncopro> Pat should just read dono's through chat. That's efficiency
[5:02:25] <tadaosmad> Like a goddamned civilized human
[5:02:26] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> I won't spill your Red Bull into the heartless sea
[5:02:34] <waifoong98> @fillmydarksoulwithlight LUL

[5:02:52] <%spiritofmojave> I think we all had a collective Groundhog Day, we're still trapped in Hoover Dam
[5:02:54] <%Jacobblast> pat flushed himself down the toilet
[5:03:02] <AlasterAngelo> pat had to replace his drip bag so he could keep on streaming

[5:10:32] <Run44forrest> hes hungry
[5:10:35] <%OwlLightningMage> I wonder if the reason Elmo loves his own hair is because he had to survive on it when he was a dumpster baby
[5:10:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> What the fuck is that
[5:10:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> hungry for Self Hair
[5:10:41] <aimlesshealer> @Parapattern LUL
[5:10:48] <tadaosmad> I also like my hair
[5:10:49] <%ThetaFive> You can macro those keypads to whatever you want
[5:10:53] <$RubberFistFight> @PlagueOfGripes Oh I have one of those, the Razer version, at least. They're super useful for some stuff. Less useful for others.

[5:11:33] <tadaosmad> Big Emlo scratchies
[5:11:35] <%Tyonidus> I think gaming and playing guitar for years is causing me to get the start of carpel tunnel....how to stop chat?
[5:11:37] <%salty_syd913> NO
[5:11:44] <%Starlight_Gamer> Where's Paige?
[5:11:44] <waifoong98> play SMT3 Pat LUL , also SMTD2 X DMCV is real
[5:11:51] <$RubberFistFight> @Tyonidus wrist and finger exercises.
[5:12:13] <+FloorBurger> Pat, wear the boots.
[5:12:13] <$RubberFistFight> @Tyonidus concentrating on joint health and flexibility specifically.
[5:12:14] <Run44forrest> wh
[5:12:16] <%Gray_skies1993> as a fellow guitarist/gamer @Tyonidus I can confirm @RubberFistFight is correct
[5:12:18] <tadaosmad> Finger exercises also double as pleasure
[5:12:18] <%Reizie_Etherealm> CORE FEATURE
[5:12:27] <$MightyMaxT> Like SFV with Arcade mode?
[5:12:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> lobbies would only increase the chances whales may not feel lonely
[5:12:33] <%Tyonidus> @Gray_skies1993 so what exercises? You gots a link or something? lol
[5:12:34] <+cvp5127> priorities
[5:12:35] <waifoong98> Yeah well, never expects anything from Koei
[5:12:41] <suikudo> Wait what isnt shipping with lobbies?
[5:12:46] <%shinzm1911> oof
[5:12:47] <Finaldragoon> I'd rather spend $90 knowing what I'm getting than $90 on gacha slot machines
[5:12:49] <waifoong98> It took them a month to give Orochi 4 a fucking SORT BUTTON
[5:12:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> DOA
[5:12:51] <+giogiothethird> is pat in the middle of streaming or his he done for tonight?
[5:12:56] <alcors_wisdom> they pulled a little sneaky one on you
[5:13:00] <Nina96> wait it dosnt have lobbys or do u gotta buy lobbys?
[5:13:04] <$RubberFistFight> @Tyonidus you can literally just google "wrist and thumb exercises carpal tunnel" and get a bunch of stuff, they're not terribly complex. the hardest part is remembering to do them.
[5:13:04] <%Agami23> maaan, what is the deal with multiplayer in dmc5? was that fake or real?
[5:13:07] <Run44forrest> done
[5:13:11] <tadaosmad> Multiplayer in what now
[5:13:18] <%Tyonidus> @RubberFistFight cool, super appreciate it brother
[5:13:20] <$RubberFistFight> You can also get wrist/palmar support but some people find them overly restrictive.
[5:13:22] <%TheHeroAppears> @Agami23 it's real fake
[5:13:25] <%decent_gaming> cheer500 super glad tonight was the first of your streams I managed to catch live. Especially since I just finished binging your New Vegas VODS over the last few days.
[5:13:26] <+giogiothethird> no the multiplayer should be a thing
[5:13:37] <%spiritofmojave> @Agami23 It's either fake, or probably some time-trial thing
[5:13:42] <%spiritofmojave> That's my guess anyway
[5:13:44] <$RubberFistFight> i mean they're designed to restrict movement, but yeah they can be something of an obstruction depending on what you're doing with your hands.
[5:13:46] <+giogiothethird> its like a ceo when you jump into someones game
[5:13:54] <tadaosmad> It's fine
[5:13:55] <FracturedImage> it's ok we know we arent
[5:13:56] <+giogiothethird> cameo
[5:13:57] <waifoong98> Also rmb, even if not DOA, Koei sold a fuck ton of DLC for Orochi 3 and that game got released like 4-5 times
[5:13:59] <+Toast_Master_General> So many secrets
[5:14:01] <%Spydurman> we're more important, we give you money Jebaited

[5:14:02] <+miguelrod777> dad doesn't love us anymore

[5:14:33] <+giogiothethird> stay safe nacho
[5:14:33] <%Gray_skies1993> sounds like LIFE in general
[5:14:35] <$RubberFistFight> @Tyonidus you're quite welcome, man. Look after your wrists and finger joints, they can go bad and stay that way real fast.
[5:14:39] <aimlesshealer> You can avoid that feeling if you have no life like me
[5:14:44] <NachoCanDandyRavage> thank frens
[5:14:45] <%Cavumentum> Is this where Pat finally breaks into the VA business and leaves us all behind to become anime
[5:14:46] <%Remery_> Death is a soda
[5:14:46] <Nina96> thats why mortality is a blessing pat
[5:14:50] <%OwlLightningMage> Life is pointless, painful, and never ending LUL
[5:14:54] <%spacekataz18> For da warhammer bois
[5:14:55] <alcors_wisdom> pat i have more jobs than you have video games trust me i know
[5:15:06] <%SaltyDongs> do it
[5:15:10] <%Fenlig> Playing intense games from sofa feels weird. I need to be able to lean in
[5:15:10] <waifoong98> do hentai VA you fuck, it is all bad LUL
[5:15:11] <%D33TR> literally painting warhammer while watching pat
[5:15:11] <tadaosmad> Life is made for you to get NG+ to your son
[5:15:13] <%spacekataz18> Pat already anime
[5:15:14] <@PlagueOfGripes> yes. yes you are not good at that
[5:15:14] <%El_Desperad0> lies
[5:15:23] <Run44forrest> just do your normal voice
[5:15:25] <%spiritofmojave> Be a Bethesda actor reused for a whole game, I believe in you
[5:15:27] <alcors_wisdom> youre already a VA thanks to plague
[5:15:29] <DracaenaLeaf> There would be so many outtakes
[5:15:32] <%Remery_> do it become a slutty pokemon
[5:15:34] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PlagueOfGripes You could be a good voice actor though Plague
[5:15:36] <%Remery_> like a voltorb
[5:15:36] <aimlesshealer> @PlagueOfGripes give us the tapes
[5:15:41] <%s_xylocalsingles> you already do it for your shorts
[5:15:41] <tadaosmad> Pat is a Snorlax
[5:15:43] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat no way man, that Skyrim mod with you guys in it you're definitely the best as far as sounding like a legit VA
[5:15:50] <tadaosmad> Or a Weibull.
[5:15:50] <%shinzm1911> Yuuuuuup
[5:15:50] <42nfl19> But all you have to do is just your voice boom. You are a voice actor with one voice! Like all the highly known VAs
[5:15:55] <%Tyonidus> @RubberFistFight yeah i don't like that lol video games are one thing, and having to limit/stop would be bad, but I would be more ashamed if I couldn't play guitar the same ways anymore. At least people respect that hobby LOL
[5:15:58] <tadaosmad> But a sexy Weibull.
[5:15:59] <%Remery_> or a shuckle
[5:16:14] <alcors_wisdom> fuck i forgot about that skyrim mod
[5:16:24] <%Gray_skies1993> that's the best Skyrim mod ever
[5:16:25] <+giogiothethird> they did a mod?
[5:16:27] <%Gray_skies1993> fight me anyone
[5:16:32] <Nina96> what mod?
[5:16:40] <Finaldragoon> that level of throttling you'd think they were a CenturyLink customer
[5:16:44] <tadaosmad> Titty mod
[5:16:47] <alcors_wisdom> @giogiothethird yeah some guy moded the 3 of them into the game
[5:16:48] <+InsomniacPersona> Co-op skyrim beta has actually been fun
[5:16:49] <waifoong98> Moviebob LUL
[5:16:49] <%Fenlig> Huge donger mods are the best mods

[5:16:51] <%VanaSkiller> apatHoldon
[5:16:51] <%Gray_skies1993> I forget who made the mod, but it has Matt, Pat and Woolie as followers
[5:16:52] <waifoong98> what a joke
[5:16:54] <twisted__fister> yahtzee's still alive??
[5:17:00] <%ThePuddingDead> yooo what up Yahtzee!

[5:17:02] <Clyderso> Whos Moviebob? PogChamp
[5:17:04] <%spiritofmojave> Haven't seen it, or any reviews for it.
[5:17:04] <$RubberFistFight> @Tyonidus if it makes you feel any better, the problem isn't the hobby itself. ANY repetitive movement will wear down your joints if you're not careful. When the typewriter was invented, there was a fucking huge uptick in people with wrist problems, as an example.
[5:17:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Bullshit
[5:17:09] <%Chatterbox1991> wait was that actually Yatzee?

[5:17:11] <waifoong98> @Clyderso a failure LUL
[5:17:14] <$ooblagis> Everything Moviebob says is embarassing, you don't need a specific moment to assume he said something dumb

[5:17:19] <+theAncopro> X to Doubt

[5:17:24] <tadaosmad> Binary Domain is the best
[5:17:24] <JonKhan> X
