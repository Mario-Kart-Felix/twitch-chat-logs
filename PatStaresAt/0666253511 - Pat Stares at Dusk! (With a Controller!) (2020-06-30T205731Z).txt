[0:06:21] <%Shady_Squid> Was such destruction YOUR intent Pat?
[0:06:25] <%Ninestempest> provoking
[0:06:27] <%Pyroclase> You would totally be that guy playing FFXIV on a second monitor during a Zoom meeting

[0:06:45] <%Ninestempest> complex... I guess summoner
[0:06:52] <%ChestMimik> That sounds frustrating
[0:06:56] <%BoneofMalkav> And not Monk the TV show LUL
[0:06:58] <%bravelysegfault> Summoner for sure
[0:06:58] <%SpookySpaghooti> oh hi

[0:06:59] <Psyramics> Don't judge classes by how they are at level 15
[0:07:03] <+Remery_> it don't mind not having a lot of complexity because extreme bosses are annoying dances
[0:07:03] <%spiritofmojave> NIN mudras are annoying
[0:07:11] <%xWanderingFlame> Stay away from the summoner

[0:22:22] <%xxmagonx> Monk is very underwhelming
[0:22:23] <%Pengers> its a lot of work for not as much dps
[0:22:30] <%MegboyManuel> i hate samurai "feel" SO BAD
[0:22:38] <%ChestMimik> Is FF fun for someone with zero experience with MMOs?
[0:22:42] <%spiritofmojave> MNK is hardly worth the effort next to SAM
[0:22:45] <%Pyroclase> I love how you tweeted about monk and half the replies thought you were talking about the TV show
[0:22:46] <%lucidrush> i play NIN and idk man, it just keeps getting more complicated @PatStaresAt
[0:22:47] <%WhereIsWill> thats fair LUL
[0:22:48] <%sshen> summoner has 7 Pat
[0:22:49] <%Metballs> For melees my preference goes SAM > MNK > NIN > DRG, but SAM to MNK is a power gap
[0:22:55] <%Shady_Squid> It has basically no good off GDC's and it just feels sloooooow.
[0:22:58] <%Selendri_> To be fair samurai has 3 fillers
[0:23:07] <%Magick_Man> Summoner has a 2 minute intro that if you fuck up just Wall yourself.

[0:44:06] <%rosabellamelantha> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries Pat trying to beat the second to last level with a controller will be fine
[0:44:07] <%BeezusHrist> how dynamic the engine was

[0:46:47] <%ChestMimik> Why would the game do this? Go on the internet and tell lies?
[0:46:49] <+Javaa01> There's a teleporter down there, you're just too blind to find it
[0:46:50] <%Starotter70> There is

[0:59:41] <%Starotter70> @PatStaresAt Apparently, Big John's in a LOT of new blood games
[0:59:45] <%worldbrand> Why aren't you playing *squints* hentai solitaire
[0:59:45] <+glgzephyr> Mortar has manual detonate because of course it does
[0:59:49] <%toolofparanoia> that some neo religious shit
[0:59:50] <%maenos2> what
[0:59:56] <%toolofparanoia> lol
[0:59:56] <%Starotter70> @thesyndrome Ye
[0:59:59] <faintsmile> uhhh
[1:00:02] <%BeezusHrist> not yet, but it is "summer" so I'm expecting it soon. Death Stranding should be soon, too @patstaresat
[1:00:03] <$Slimshazbot> I'd say it started as Blood
[1:00:03] <%heartlesshealer> so absolutely babel as in the tower to reach god
[1:00:03] <%Daxalog> it became half life for a bit also
[1:00:04] <Louie_Salmon> Wait who was that
[1:00:04] <%rosabellamelantha> I love this level
[1:00:06] <JayEarly> oh boy
[1:00:09] <MonstarGrrrl> ju;p
[1:00:09] <+thesyndrome> @Starotter70 nice ty
[1:00:10] <+IcepickXIII> Blue key!!
[1:00:12] <+glgzephyr> I only played Quake III Arena....
[1:00:17] <%toolofparanoia> don
[1:00:20] <+lbCyber> There was also some Hexen in there
[1:00:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> Bitch doesn't even know this is Skyrim
[1:00:40] <%Starotter70> The cowgirls are the worst
[1:00:49] <%BeezusHrist> @patstaresat and I asked because I just beat it but I want to play it again in 4k LUL
[1:00:52] <+gitgouda> i just got here and im loving everything i am seeing.
[1:00:58] <+thesyndrome> I love how EVERYTHING in this game is a projectile, no hitscan bullshit top deal with here
[1:01:01] <%BeezusHrist> 4k 60
[1:01:04] <JayEarly> none of the weapons are particularly unique aside from the magic crossbow but they are all so fucking good
[1:01:04] <%hzealot> wtf is this game?
[1:01:06] <%toolofparanoia> don't worry pat its just turning into non-euclidean insanity slowly.
[1:01:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> This is actaully NBA street vol.2 for the ps2
[1:01:16] <%toolofparanoia> DUSK
[1:01:23] <$Slimshazbot> Has Pat played ultrakill? Because HOLY SHIT ULTRAKILL
[1:01:25] <@BigNaturalMan59> the hit noise sounds like a really airy fart
[1:01:30] <+gitgouda> quake engine?
[1:01:30] <+glgzephyr> I'm a large fan of this game's choice of SFX
[1:01:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> but with hints of NFL street 2 featuring exzibit
[1:01:47] <%toolofparanoia> hup hup hup
[1:01:49] <%Zereaux> what are the cultist trying to do?
[1:01:50] <+thesyndrome> has anyone told Pat the true secret to the crossbow yet? that it not only pierces enemies, but in fact pierces EVERYTHING including all walls in it's path
[1:01:53] <JayEarly> If Woolie hasn't played Ultrakill I would be incredibly surprised
[1:02:02] <+AJ_Cherenkov> You thought livin da dream went off the rails? you ain't seen shit @Pookiedaexzile @hzealot
[1:02:16] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[1:02:21] <%Zereaux> stafe turn out to not be good right?
[1:02:22] <%ha2ken> First try
[1:02:36] <iamtheTwitchghost> so what makes this game special compared to old quake games?
[1:02:43] <+Javaa01> Blue was for the front door
[1:02:43] <%heartlesshealer> save midair, sure nothing bad will happen on load
[1:02:46] <+thesyndrome> @Zereaux strafe was a big disappointment for me as a backer
[1:02:50] <%Daxalog> Strafe has its merits. Though it has problems
[1:02:55] <iamtheTwitchghost> oh i see
[1:02:59] <+lbCyber> It's fun
[1:03:01] <%Pyroclase> This game has incredible variety of levels, I love it
[1:03:03] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:03:05] <+gitgouda> lul
[1:03:05] <+Javaa01> Throw it at enemies to make them infight
[1:03:06] <+YabbaTroll> oh no
[1:03:07] <+lbCyber> welp
[1:03:09] <LoneFonte> :O
[1:03:09] <%Starotter70> It makes enemies fight each other
[1:03:10] <+lbCyber> that was a waste
[1:03:10] <%DappercatEsquire> Probably won't have any repercussions
[1:03:12] <%WhereIsWill> welp\
[1:03:14] <+AJ_Cherenkov> oh no ,he broked the crystal
[1:03:15] <%toolofparanoia> blew it
[1:03:18] <$Slimshazbot> STRAFE wasn't the game it said it was going to be. It was a fine game, just not a good retro shooter
[1:03:19] <+glgzephyr> @JayEarly Woolie will wait six months to play Ultrakill because it's popular and he's a pure-blooded hipster
[1:03:22] <Psyramics> did you destroy the madness or let all the madness out?
[1:03:22] <JayEarly> I like the enemies and general combat more than Quake by a lot
[1:03:25] <+shry2049> THIS DOOR OPENS ELSEWHERE
[1:03:26] <%galaxyswirl> bad end
[1:03:33] <LoneFonte> you spilled the madness on the floor!
[1:03:34] <JayEarly> Quake's enemy roster kinda sucks
[1:03:36] <%heartlesshealer> was it "the" crystal of madness, or "life" crystal of madness?
[1:03:37] <+BlackSunEmperor> @PatStaresAt throw the crystal of madness at enemies and it makes them fight each other
[1:03:40] <%BeezusHrist> Death Stranding II coming
[1:03:47] <+lethallylactic> oh oh oh
[1:03:53] <+gitgouda> OHH! OHOHH!
[1:04:05] <cipher758> oh?
[1:04:07] <iamtheTwitchghost> oh shit, ultrakill has a style meter? damn atpHorns
[1:04:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> @AJ_Cherenkov I've seen the truth, and the truth tells me this ends more like Nba street vol 3 with the dunk contest and unlockable mario characters
[1:04:15] <%tinyswampthing> quake is good but was kinda just doom but full 3d which makes since considering its fucked development
[1:04:23] <%rosabellamelantha> So those scientists are easy as fuck to kill but if they DO hit you they deal a SHITTON of damage even on normal
[1:04:30] <%Zereaux> you hows the new streets of rage?
[1:04:50] <%heartlesshealer> oh god those are back
[1:04:51] <faintsmile> party
[1:04:51] <+glgzephyr> @Zereaux If you like old Streets, you'll really like new Streets
[1:04:51] <%augusm> augusm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! does this game fire cum?
[1:04:52] <$Slimshazbot> The ULTRAKILL flip a coin into the air and shoot it to instantly headshot a neaby enemy thing is the DOPEST THING
[1:04:57] <%demegodz> Naruto run
[1:05:00] <SleepyMaribo> was that a wendigo?
[1:05:04] <+vonloke> that enemy was straight out of serious sam, holy cow
[1:05:07] <+thesyndrome> 2hp
[1:05:11] <%WhereIsWill> now thats a lotta damage
[1:05:12] <+lethallylactic> monkaS
[1:05:14] <JayEarly> @SleepyMaribo yep
[1:05:17] <%BigCoffee> Pat the pistols share machinegun ammo
[1:05:19] <%Daxalog> I still hate the sound effect for when you get it. The low bit crunch at the start.
[1:05:24] <%toolofparanoia> 2 HEALTH BUT all enemies dead psaUp
[1:05:25] <%heartlesshealer> the outside corner door?

[1:06:17] <+kirby9b> hey pat
[1:06:22] <%AlphaTauri> that place must have needed a tall tower to build on top of
[1:06:24] <%heartlesshealer> oh
[1:06:32] <%BeezusHrist> Turtles in the half shell, Turtle power
[1:06:35] <$Slimshazbot> I... can't think of any other skylabs.
[1:06:38] <+glgzephyr> that's not a good name for a place
[1:06:47] <JayEarly> god the super shotgun is so satisfying
[1:06:48] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @rosabellamelantha does this game have a story?
[1:06:49] <%toolofparanoia> "intruder spotted!"
[1:06:56] <Kalinflip> ahahaa
[1:07:02] <+AJ_Cherenkov> YES
[1:07:03] <%Essixian> I thought that said "A shortstack opens", my disappointment is immeasurable.
[1:07:03] <+Javaa01> Yes

[1:08:37] <$Slimshazbot> Like, Pat loves DMC and Retro Shooters, the fact that he hasn't jumped on Ultrakill yet blows my mind
[1:08:39] <%BeezusHrist> lol
[1:08:41] <%ha2ken> Pillarmen
[1:08:43] <+Javaa01> It's just one way to go forward
[1:08:46] <Arrowpoison1> Yeah, I think you might be able to strafe jump from the smokestacks to get there.
[1:08:49] <%SirGO0SE> Pasta is my favorite element
[1:08:50] <+glgzephyr> is that what we're calling it now? not fart gas?
[1:09:01] <%Starotter70> SOAP

[1:11:03] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> well there's an iconic gaming ringtone if i ever heard one
[1:11:17] <+glgzephyr> I don't think Pat will really mind backeating for a game with this particular flavor of obtuse level design
[1:11:30] <@SoFarFetched> Is that like fronteating? LUL
[1:11:44] <%BeezusHrist> Bad guys who like to, loot and plunderrrrrr
[1:11:50] <%ha2ken> FPS's make me want to believe that you are not person but actually GUN
[1:11:52] <cipher758> this
[1:12:01] <+lbCyber> Just a reminder, crossbows shoot through walls
[1:12:04] <+glgzephyr> nah specifically backeating
[1:12:06] <%Starotter70> @PatStaresAt The crossbow is useful for those guys since it can go thropugh walls
[1:12:07] <%ToxInjection> Is this a Strafe-like??
[1:12:07] <+Pars_Librum> Sickles can knock those back
[1:12:10] <cipher758> floating arms dude

[1:12:32] <%WackyGear> kill it
[1:12:33] <iamtheTwitchghost> fart gas machine
[1:12:41] <SleepyMaribo> you cant just call it cursed
[1:12:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> "That is cursed I don't know what that is"
[1:12:54] <+Javaa01> That is not an unholy altar that you need to shoot repeatedly
[1:12:57] <%Starotter70> Looks like my air conditioner
[1:13:00] <+Spr0cket> thats probably where the madness gem was supposed to go

[1:17:20] <%realm_forge> @sleepymaribo it’s got a really fun mechanic, and the gameplay is a fun mind bender to solve, but I wouldn’t call it deep
[1:17:26] <+not_draven> is this the type of shooter that makes woolie ill?
[1:17:26] <%CursedNobleman> the part that really disturbs me is the gore in the old shooters
[1:17:42] <%seniormeatbox> @not_draven this is dem debil games

[1:19:39] <%rosabellamelantha> Episode 3 is still my personal fave tho
[1:20:03] <SleepyMaribo> so whats the story behind this game? Did a cult fuck up?
[1:20:13] <Mnemonicjohnny> @PatStaresAt Fun fact about the Crossbow, too -- it pierces level geometry and gives you a little boost if you fire in midair.

[1:20:51] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> What is this game? 0w0
[1:20:52] <%Starotter70> Treasure man came into town cause apparently there was supposed to be treasure underground, get's caught by a cult, then escapes and this starts happening

[1:23:43] <%mMayrro> big panics
[1:23:43] <+AJ_Cherenkov> they failed
[1:23:44] <SleepyMaribo> why morale though, is it like the power of god protecting you or something?
[1:24:01] <ObsidianDragon86> It's the power of 'Oooh Shiny!'
[1:24:03] <+AJ_Cherenkov> it's like ego in duke nukum
[1:24:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SleepyMaribo and anime
[1:24:07] <%CursedNobleman> @SleepyMaribo getting treasure or drinking booze feeds your murderhobo ego.
[1:24:09] <%seniormeatbox> Soldiers, Welders, Doctors, and Big John are possessed.

[1:31:44] <%seniormeatbox> watch as pat telefrags the boss
[1:31:44] <+Javaa01> Because that area otherwise has no way out, so if you wanna backtrack, they had to add a teleporter

[1:32:39] <Mnemonicjohnny> Man, I really adore how hard this game goes on its spoopy elements.
[1:32:41] <CurrySauseBandit> Don't think holding next to a wall works well for those

[1:34:12] <+Javaa01> Like Residue Processing, but not as bad
[1:34:12] <+dasmause> would you normally believe that a game dominated by brown, piss yellow and vomit green could look so good?
[1:34:12] <%rosabellamelantha> I died so many times here the first time through this

[1:36:34] <%Essixian> @ConLin_Arts_ Nah, this is just what Pennsylvania is like
[1:36:36] <JayEarly> somehow this game manages to deliver the spooks despite the fact you're a walking arsenal

[1:38:45] <%Divryne> NICE.
[1:38:45] <%Starotter70> The fact that the game can FUCK you up despite being fully decked out also helps with the tense atmosphere
[1:38:47] <%Divryne> 10/10.
[1:38:51] <%BoneofMalkav> Woolie playing this with his frankenstein controller would be hilarious LUL
[1:38:52] <JayEarly> @BoneofMalkav Now Sacrifice, that was a game!
[1:38:53] <%Zereaux> i mean witchhouse is a music genre so i guess if someone tried old god americana can be too

[1:39:03] <Rhinoprotoss> Controller aim looks so bad
[1:39:05] <%seniormeatbox> @mMayrro It's an aircraft throttle in one hand, a DDR pad for the left foot and a arcade joystick for the other hand
[1:39:11] <%rosabellamelantha> Woolie is going to fucking die playing this
[1:39:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> SPOOPS
[1:39:15] <Coystick> Nice Shotgun slinging

[1:40:37] <%Zereaux> morir ese vivr
[1:40:48] <%rosabellamelantha> I really do like the way this game looks, it works super well for the horror the game goes for, low poly can be a legitimate artstyle @PatStaresAt
[1:40:55] <%Zereaux> AYI ESTA
[1:41:01] <Coystick> Dave is right at this second writing code to send a mild electric shock through the controller for whenever controller users try to save.

[2:00:11] <%seniormeatbox> @PatStaresAt this is more Dark Corners and less Gloomwood/Hexen
[2:00:16] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> #JusticeForMonks BibleThump
[2:00:19] <captainshtbox> what was the monk show about?
[2:00:26] <%PanicSwytch> Is this the dungeons of irythil?
[2:00:33] <%rosabellamelantha> The priestesses
[2:00:38] <+AJ_Cherenkov> cop show, like most network tv
[2:00:39] <+Grayhammatter> sure... that happened

[2:01:06] <%snow_bush> snow_bush subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 19 month anniversary? Great! Instead of cursed knowledge like greek sandals basically being bondage for foot fetishists, have some knowledge that Caligula naming his horse senator was more him being snide at the senate being 'useful' rather than insane.
[2:01:11] <%Pyroclase> I assume you already know what the soap does
[2:01:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dusk was picked up by NB much earlier than Gloomwood, but Dusk Dude IS working on Gloomwood too, so the similiarities are likely.

[2:59:16] <%ReenMan350> red
[2:59:20] <%MegboyManuel> i wonder what the main character of this game looks like, thinking of arting em
[2:59:30] <MasterTonberry23> You came to the WRONG part of town muthafucka!
[2:59:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> Clean out the Ghettos, Pat
[2:59:36] <%Essixian> What I really don't like (but also love) about those enemies is how their huge mouths are wide open and they STILL sound like they can barely breathe.
[2:59:41] <JayEarly> there's art of Dusk Dude
[2:59:47] <%rosabellamelantha> @MegboyManuel there's art of the main character
[2:59:55] <+AJ_Cherenkov> @MegboyManuel look up "dusk dude", you'll find lots of art
[2:59:59] <%tinyswampthing> dusk dude had fan art that became offical art
[2:59:59] <%GalacticaPhanto> !uptime
[2:59:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 8s.
[3:00:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:00:06] <%Starotter70> Dusk Dude looks kinda like Plague
[3:00:06] <%MegboyManuel> dusk dude, gotcha
[3:00:11] <+lbCyber> Dusk dude basically looks like angry santa
[3:00:15] <%dinnydanny777> Why does the battle music sound like it's about to reach a crescendo

[3:00:36] <+lbCyber> he just want hug
[3:00:37] <MasterTonberry23> Although Dusk Guy's design isnt actually official, the devs just took the accepted fan design and ran with hit
[3:00:40] <%Piemen99> Lozer
[3:00:45] <%Essixian> Specifically, there's fanart of the main character. The dev liked one piece in particular so much that he adopted it as the official look of Dusk Dude, as he hadn't had one prior to that.
[3:00:49] <%ReenMan350> blue
[3:01:03] <+AJ_Cherenkov> well, it's used in the outro, so I'd say it's canon now
[3:01:03] <%rufus2k2> I wonder if this has color blind options all of a sudden
[3:01:08] <MasterTonberry23> Your health is low, find a demon to glory kill
[3:01:12] <%MegboyManuel> i love the effects in this game tho, i wonder if it's inengine physics, or all hand animated
[3:01:17] <JayEarly> Dusk Dude is like Plague's face with Pat's body type
[3:01:35] <$joylent_blue> that Dusk Dude art IS sick, to be fair
[3:01:35] <%Pyroclase> It's a bathroom, Pat.

[3:28:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[3:28:40] <cliffpuncher> @rekinom Soap one hit kills anything in the game
[3:28:41] <MasterTonberry23> @rekinom It instakills any enemies you touch with it

[3:40:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> I can't believe @NewBlood hacked his game because he's unworthy
[3:40:52] <%heartlesshealer> oh damn
[3:40:53] <Aydarkzero> Devs exposed live on stream
[3:40:55] <%honeyman18> FINAL BOSS, SUPER GLITCH
[3:40:56] <+Pars_Librum> It's a bug for COWARDS
[3:40:56] <Nightweaver20xx> THANKS TODD
[3:40:57] <%mMayrro> shoulda been a thing if you skipped the trial LUL
[3:41:00] <%miguelrod777> Balls exposed
[3:41:02] <Finakala> That's what you get for playing with a controller
[3:41:02] <%Starotter70> Maybe it wouldn't happen if you weren't a coward
[3:41:02] <snakemuho> good job coward Kappa
[3:41:02] <%코코꾸라> THE CONTROLLER PLAYER DEFEATED YOU, NEW BLOOD
[3:41:03] <+lbCyber> It only happens with cowards
[3:41:03] <NewBlood> its a controller bug lmao
[3:41:04] <+Meta1spy51> LUL
[3:41:05] <TheFramedWarlock> BLOODS EXPOSED
[3:41:05] <SomeOtherNeb> it WOULD be funny
[3:41:06] <%californaya> Get it together, game designers!
[3:41:06] <thelonechris> Are you sure the game didn't just take your stuff because you bitched out?
[3:41:07] <TheyCallMeVawn> U N W O R T H Y
[3:41:07] <NewBlood> so nobody ever found it
[3:41:07] <%Joustar_> LUL
[3:41:08] <rekinom> "That only happens if you're a ginger baby named pat, sorry"
[3:41:08] <huskarl_zap> only happens to gingers
[3:41:09] <TJW211> would be based tbh
[3:41:11] <rytisone> they put bugs for unworthy ones
[3:41:11] <Torruun> The real final boss was the coding all along
[3:41:11] <OToole42> almost like you got punished for bitching out
[3:41:12] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:41:14] <cipher758> ooh shit

[3:41:19] <%dukenux> pfft
[3:41:20] <+Javaa01> Nah, if they call you out on it, they'll call you out cause you were a biiiitch
[3:41:24] <%DappercatEsquire> @NewBlood nice save
[3:41:24] <+Javaa01> And skipped Dweller
[3:41:30] <panic_rabbit> balls out on stream
[3:41:33] <Archer27> it's funnier to fuck over the UNWORTHY
[3:41:35] <+NitronStreams> it only happens in pats version of the game
[3:41:36] <lessthanhuman_tv> I would probably do controller plus gyro for this and Doom 2016 tbh
[3:41:36] <+Loinclothiclese> Thats what you get for being bitch pat
[3:41:40] <armchairmaster_> Make sure you SAVE PAT
[3:41:41] <cipher758> Pat 1 x Dave 1
[3:41:48] <BisoromiBear> the combination of controller player + coward renders the game unplayable by design
[3:41:49] <+AJ_Cherenkov> Streamer AND DEVS have balls exposed today
