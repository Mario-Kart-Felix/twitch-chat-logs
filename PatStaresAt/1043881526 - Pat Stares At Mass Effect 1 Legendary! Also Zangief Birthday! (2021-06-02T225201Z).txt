[0:26:14] <%dankjerri> psaWrong
[0:26:15] <%SaiyanShoto> VF5 is still fun
[0:26:18] <$Ziegsy> is it me or is there a slight delay in the video?
[0:26:20] <%DaKnightWarrior> Half on my matches was super bad.
[0:26:21] <+glgzephyr> It's probably because Max is just better than you LUL
[0:26:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ashlet'Remember no Turian' Williams
[0:26:23] <+McSoliace> its sad that the games good but netcode make it real bad
[0:26:25] <Profmcstevie> adaptation is high
[0:26:41] <%kewlmyc> That's fair
[0:26:50] <%Monkeyweed21> I can't believe that you beat Suzi Sphere Hunter in a first to 10
[0:26:53] <iosephe> 0-2 but it was close
[0:26:55] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[0:26:56] <Profmcstevie> Not a Lv1 CPU LETS GOOOO
[0:26:57] <%kewlmyc> LUL
[0:26:57] <Ipsenscastle> but when you play Woolie it's important you destroy him

[0:27:02] <+HefestoForges> shots fired

[0:27:04] <HaroldDonchee> is this the 2nd or 3rd mass effect stream?
[0:27:04] <%BigCoffee> what does being free mena
[0:27:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> You are all free now

[0:27:18] <%Monkeyweed21> NAGO IS STILL BAD
[0:27:19] <%dekkitout> It's not Woolie's fault his favs are always bad

[0:27:28] <%barkon345> @BigCoffee it means your a free win.
[0:27:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> So is Pat's Shepard gonna try to bone or what?
[0:27:49] <$Ziegsy> ziegsyHoo Hee-ho
[0:27:49] <Dunmarkh> purple ashley
[0:27:51] <+McSoliace> that was like max's second real night of playing vf too
[0:28:02] <%maenos2> LUL
[0:28:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> I been knew that
[0:28:07] <Blank9> mass effect is a sliding scale of gameplay vs story the whole series
[0:28:09] <@SSaryn> Honestly, if I were to replay any of them, it would be 2.
[0:28:09] <Profmcstevie> Being hard on thing means hate, shut up
[0:28:14] <Minorou> we're more prone to dunk on things we love
[0:28:15] <Broken_Sonex> I.....would not enjoy a Woolie Vs Me to be honest
[0:28:21] <Blank9> 1 slanted towards story, 3 toward gameplay
[0:28:21] <Profmcstevie> Nobody says ANYTHING bad about things they love smh smh
[0:28:22] <Ipsenscastle> it's so much more lush looking than 1
[0:28:24] <+glgzephyr> people also love taking things you say out of context to support their insane takes @PatStaresAt
[0:28:24] <+JaseAdrift> when you love something you sometimes judge it harder
[0:28:24] <$KetsuoTaberu> True
[0:28:25] <T_Sasquatch> I
[0:28:26] <%RetroCop87> I love KH2, but that fucking game man...
[0:28:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hell the entire trilogy is one of my favourite ecer
[0:28:32] <peachy996> Tali is a poor swimmer
[0:28:32] <%saadi90> It’s great
[0:28:34] <%Jeemukun> people these days don't understand that you can love something but still have issues with it
[0:28:35] <T_Sasquatch> Yup LUL
[0:28:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> AND THEN MASS EFFECT 3
[0:28:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kappa
[0:28:42] <T_Sasquatch> MONEY
[0:28:42] <%the38bandit> Favorite weapon in mass effect 2?
[0:28:43] <%Monkeyweed21> man I never played the ME2 DLC cuz of the Bioware Point shit
[0:28:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Vidya Gaems PogChamp
[0:28:51] <%barkon345> @BigCoffee it stems from the tournament scene where if you got paired with a crappy player it meant you got a free jump in the ranks
[0:28:52] <@SSaryn> nice
[0:28:54] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[0:28:56] <+mikesapartment> gun aint bad
[0:28:57] <$KetsuoTaberu> Then ME3 polished away all of the RPG elements
[0:28:58] <Ipsenscastle> Widow sniper
[0:28:58] <%Mrbaconator> space carths hand went THROUGH HIS HEAD
[0:28:58] <Reverend_Godshyne> Oh man I love gun, too
[0:28:58] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[0:29:01] <Mattais88> The gun that shoots the thing
[0:29:01] <AluxStreams> I love all 3 games equally for entirely different reasons.
[0:29:04] <%Monkeyweed21> REMEMBER BIOWARE POINTS
[0:29:04] <%captainpodock> I can see Woolie literally sitting there for 30 minutes agonizing over what choose he's going to make lol
[0:29:07] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Widow.
[0:29:08] <+D00msDayDan> the jank's the best part
[0:29:12] <@SSaryn> If you don't love the Black Widow, I don't love you.
[0:29:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Vanguard is the best b/c BIOTIC HEADBUTT
[0:29:13] <%Eaglestrike117> @PatStaresAt Ok but WHICH assault rifle?
[0:29:14] <%maenos2> mass effect 3 has the best vanguard setup
[0:29:18] <+glgzephyr> those games had good gunplay
[0:29:22] <+Captbutt> wtf
[0:29:25] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Widow destroys armor.
[0:29:25] <aiutare47> Gral or widow
[0:29:25] <Ipsenscastle> I never say this, but you literally played them wrong somehow
[0:29:25] <+eanscrale> Well that's when EA bought them, so the COD analogy is pretty on point.
[0:29:26] <Sotetsu> I like sniper rifles. PrideFloat
[0:29:27] <+JobbedBone> more like mass effect *fun*
[0:29:31] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Im the type off dweeb who likes me2 the least for rpg raisins
[0:29:33] <%saadi90> Without the multiplayer BS. ME3 is pretty good. The ending stuff is still lame
[0:29:33] <Broken_Sonex> @captainpodock O V E R T H I N K I N G
[0:29:35] <%lildashots> if ME2 ran on ME1s engine I'd still think its a good step ahead of its predecessor, but yea holy FUCK did it feel better
[0:29:36] <knight_verse> wait until you see Mass Effect 2 jank.
[0:29:44] <peachy996> I can see Woolie agonizing over everything
[0:29:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its called Gun
[0:29:49] <Thepothero> Mattock to the head your dead baby crikPog
[0:29:56] <+glgzephyr> the Spectre weapons are so fucking busted
[0:29:59] <+glgzephyr> is it the Black Widow?
[0:30:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Also play Gun pat
[0:30:01] <%JamesCorck> No Vanguard in ME2? Granted, Soldier is far better suited if you're attempting to do an insanity run.
[0:30:05] <+YabbaTroll> geth shotgun?
[0:30:05] <aiutare47> Revenant?
[0:30:06] <+JobbedBone> Kreygasm
[0:30:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> The Specter master gear?
[0:30:08] <@SSaryn> Ah yeah ok, Revenant.,
[0:30:09] <Mattais88> The Mattock in 3 was the best
[0:30:11] <%BigCoffee> Playing infiltrator and having a sniping contest with Garrus rocks
[0:30:12] <%JamesCorck> Geth Sniper rifle is a fucking beast, tho.
[0:30:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Play that oldass western game
[0:30:15] <%Eaglestrike117> Oh, i know what you mean
[0:30:19] <%Eaglestrike117> Revenant
[0:30:20] <Finakala> Three diagonal lines that line up? So... a triangle?
[0:30:25] <%JamesCorck> Geth Sniper only has one bullet, but it kills everytthing.
[0:30:28] <Broken_Sonex> The one that's red and black? Love that one
[0:30:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> My favourites are the Krysae Sniper Rifle, The Venom Shotgun, and the Silenced Pistol
[0:30:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's the HMWA I think
[0:30:35] <+vaultzombie> adidas gun
[0:30:36] <+LoganWulfric> HMW Weapons
[0:30:37] <@SSaryn> Revenant is definitely a fan favorite for sure.
[0:30:40] <%BoxNavy> tally marks?
[0:30:43] <%Jeemukun> same, loved turning it into a bullet hose
[0:30:46] <peachy996> Oh yeah the upgrades that nullify the cooldown system is great
[0:30:48] <ssks123> the vindicator models
[0:30:48] <Chaos_Aether> Black window is my Favorite
[0:30:50] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Pat...you play soldier to each his own but im judging you
[0:30:53] <+JobbedBone> predator weapon marks LUL
[0:30:54] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> it's a precision AR but full auto and all black.
[0:30:54] <%JamesCorck> Geth Sniper Rifle, Krogan Shotgun. That's it.
[0:30:56] <%JamesCorck> Game over.
[0:30:59] <Finakala> I haven't played ME for a good 7 years or so, really should do a new run
[0:31:09] <%skeleklng> Bruh all this brand shit has me weak. Saw someone post a pride version of the Weyland-Yutani Corp
[0:31:10] <Ludarac> Its the HMWA Spectre master rifle
[0:31:16] <dero45> im watching the last vod and you look exactly the same lol
[0:31:18] <%Garthunox> Pat are you looking forward to your first encounter with Marauder (Shields) ?
[0:31:19] <%SkyfireHero> it was originally tied to an achievement or something
[0:31:21] <Ipsenscastle> the VII gear is bugged, the X gear shows after Virmire if you have over a million credits
[0:31:25] <ioci2112> specter gear used to unlock with a achievement in me1, but that acheivement doesn't exist anymore
[0:31:29] <mr_saturday93> frictionless materials x turns your weapons into chain guns and I love it
[0:31:39] <%BoxNavy> squeak
[0:31:40] <Ludarac> they unlock after Virmire in legendary edition
[0:31:40] <dero45> including the background lol
[0:31:49] <ssks123> i finished me1 with maxed credits lmao
[0:31:49] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Marauder Shields got patched a long time ago.
[0:31:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> I loved using mods to turn the sniper into a single-shot hitscan rocket that knocks enemies 100 ft into the air. But that's because the reticle sway was absurd.
[0:31:50] <Ludarac> regardless of credits
[0:31:53] <Ipsenscastle> the achievement was the rich achievement for getting a million credits
[0:32:07] <%JamesCorck> Pat, you going to try the armour glitch? There's a glitch in ME1 that lets you equip any armor at any point whenever you want.
[0:32:08] <%psidefx> right on time
[0:32:09] <@SSaryn> Fuck if I know.
[0:32:15] <peachy996> Sadly Explosive Rounds always take your guns to overheat at best you can get 2 more shots
[0:32:15] <retrosadness> spectre VII was available for me as soon as i got spectre, spectre X when i got level 50
[0:32:21] <$KetsuoTaberu> I've seen reports of people having to load that pre-spectre save and become spectre every time they want to buy spectre gear
[0:32:21] <mikesumusprime> i had to beat Virmiire before it unlocked in the shop
[0:32:25] <$Wurmspawn> Having played through ME1: LE I never had any trouble finding the Spector gear on the Citadel even after Virmire.
[0:32:27] <peachy996> Still cool ammo
[0:32:29] <Ludarac> make sure you get max credits before ME2, they changed how they carry over
[0:32:30] <Dfreddy8> Max creds is pretty easy to get
[0:32:32] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt any interest in playing BIOMUTANT or Mechwarrior 5?
[0:32:33] <+ThomasOfTroy> Your understanding is correct, but the stores have limited stock of the specter 7 and 10 gear
[0:32:36] <%SkyfireHero> if you unlock it in one playthrough you can buy it in any playthrough or something
[0:32:49] <$Wurmspawn> On PS4 though so I don't know if it's a PC only bug.
[0:33:02] <%dankjerri> eventually he will pronounce gerald correct
[0:33:06] <totorno> psaDogchamp
[0:33:18] <%derpy_platypus> "this pistol doesn't have a thermal clip"
[0:33:21] <+D00msDayDan> just cheat
[0:33:26] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I had to create another character to fix that bug.
[0:33:33] <Ipsenscastle> ME2 had so much less character dialogue on the ship than I remembered
[0:33:36] <%dankjerri> yeah is Juh

[0:35:56] <peachy996> Yeah you really have to keep her living past 1 to get the ideal Ashley death
[0:35:58] <acridpaladin> Shoot her a little bit. As a treat.
[0:36:02] <%dankjerri> cheer500 I changed it to prevent future confusion
[0:36:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> BASED FUTURE
[0:36:03] <+TheotherKristian> Ashley may die
[0:36:04] <@SSaryn> Or really far into the past cause fuck it.
[0:36:06] <%ssjklyco> Into the garbage
[0:36:06] <%captainpodock> into the fucking garbage
[0:36:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> 3000 AD
[0:36:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No Liara is there Pat
[0:36:10] <+even_the_yuenglings> liara will still be in it probably
[0:36:11] <Mattais88> There's a dead reaper in that trailer
[0:36:14] <Minorou> First Contact War would be awesome
[0:36:15] <%Vextalyst> cheer500 Hey pat in very slight defense of ME3 as i still hate that game, there is alot of good shit in that game it's just impossible to be fair to it when the last impression is so unbelievably bad.
[0:36:17] <Pookiedaexzile> You mean like andromeda
[0:36:19] <peachy996> Look if you kill Ashley now, she'll be recognized as a hero
[0:36:20] <Thepothero> Glass her a bit
[0:36:20] <+Captbutt> so i'll be in the past then
[0:36:21] <$RealThiele> "we must find the shepard"
[0:36:24] <%Dakuu75> good point
[0:36:26] <Mattais88> she's only 100
[0:36:28] <aiutare47> I desperately hope so but it won’t.
[0:36:29] <%dekkitout> "So this one time some shit heel saved the galaxy, or some shit..."
[0:36:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Only 900 years
[0:36:30] <+YabbaTroll> YOOOO OLD LIARA
[0:36:31] <+Raspada_Ryner> Asari live super old
[0:36:32] <%maenos2> she's only like 125
[0:36:34] <AluxStreams> I hope ME4 gets cancelled so this franchise stops being dragged through the mud.
[0:36:35] <%shurtal> 300 years easy
[0:36:35] <ape_hawk> imagine how big liaras tits will be in ME4
[0:36:36] <+even_the_yuenglings> yup
[0:36:37] <Pookiedaexzile> So can Wrex
[0:36:37] <+glgzephyr> MILF LIARA
[0:36:42] <Broken_Sonex> MILF LIARA
[0:36:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Old ass Liara
[0:36:44] <peachy996> Liara, Grunt and maybe Wrex?
[0:36:44] <%ssjklyco> Just make it so you play as the other races, not just human
[0:36:45] <mr_saturday93> she's 106 guys...
[0:36:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> She had wrinkles in the teaser
[0:36:46] <%maenos2> asari live to a thousand
[0:36:46] <+wmeldrum> she looks a little older in the teaser too
[0:36:49] <%captainpodock> That's probably the best way to tie them together
[0:36:50] <Dfreddy8> I think they are setting up a save for ME5
[0:36:51] <%SpontaneousC> there's been some rumors that it's Shepard again regardless which I really hope is bull
[0:36:51] <Dunmarkh> GILF BLUSSY
[0:36:53] <%Dakuu75> "Slumbernaught" I like that name
[0:36:54] <peachy996> Depends how old Wrex is
[0:36:56] <Ipsenscastle> I'd be happy with a game where you play as a council race before humans even show up
[0:36:56] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> They live a loooong while
[0:37:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> SPEAK

[0:41:25] <$Wurmspawn> Makes 0 sense if you went for 3 out of the 4 potential endings and didn't get max readiness with one of the endings, but it stops people complaining about "why are we stopping the war to have fun" even though with one of the endings it still doesn't work for the same reason. I just say, the Citadel DLC is about just having fun so just turn that part of the brain off.

[0:56:09] <peanutdot007> Shepard moves at a steady dad jog pace
[0:56:10] <+Punchasaur> He barks after you say his name because he’s saying Pat

[0:56:41] <%ssjklyco> It's Optimus
[0:56:44] <%captainpodock> he's working on Anti L2 legislation now.
[0:56:44] <%derpy_platypus> The peaceful solution only took a few bodies to achieve

[0:58:15] <+MightyDuckShoes> VoHiYo actualjakeYuck actualjakeYuck
[0:58:20] <%JamesCorck> This version removed Pinnacle Station, right?
[0:58:24] <%dekkitout> World minds? THATS COOL
[0:58:25] <+CursedNobleman> METAL
[0:58:27] <ianabstract> this planet is so cool
[0:58:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> AWESOME
[0:58:40] <%Lizard0TM> vex
[0:58:41] <%JamesCorck> That was such a stupid addition to the first game, Pinnacle Station I mean.
[0:58:45] <peachy996> Some planets have cool descriptions
[0:58:48] <%dankjerri> garrus
[0:58:57] <%BigCoffee> not garrus????
[0:58:59] <Chaos_Aether> Is the Sol system Accessible?
[0:59:00] <peachy996> I think there's one where 1 Volus owns it
[0:59:02] <%Treuan> same tho
[0:59:02] <aiutare47> thats me with Garrus and Tali
[0:59:04] <Ipsenscastle> Ploba and Klendagon are the best planets
[0:59:05] <+SpoopySkeletman> good
[0:59:07] <%dankjerri> WHEELIE
[0:59:09] <%Lizard0TM> I'm glad Pinnacle station is gone
[0:59:09] <Pookiedaexzile> That's a good Set, an
[0:59:10] <AluxStreams> You need Tali to hack crates.
[0:59:10] <+even_the_yuenglings> liara and garrus for me
[0:59:11] <+glgzephyr> they're a balanced squad, especially with you as vanguard
[0:59:12] <%Lizard0TM> it SUCKED
[0:59:13] <viewtifulr> nice
[0:59:16] <+MightyDuckShoes> does Pinnacle Station being removed affect the game at all?
[0:59:17] <murdocismyhero> Just take Ashley to watch her die each time
[0:59:20] <SoAndSoap> master chief sounds different than i remember?
[0:59:21] <%Monkeyweed21> MF is that foreshadowing for the Leviathans
[0:59:23] <%AzureGale> Except Kaidan and Ashley
[0:59:25] <peachy996> My favorites are Garrus and Wrex.
[0:59:25] <peanutdot007> Once Garrus gets sniper rifle god mode he's pretty great
[0:59:30] <%Robot_Nixon_> Don't we still have no idea what actually is IN jupiter?
[0:59:32] <%pyurient> is the Mako still awful?
[0:59:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Have too
[0:59:36] <%MisterRockett> I'm pretty sure this was the team I chose too.
[0:59:40] <Pookiedaexzile> no tech sucks
[0:59:41] <$Wurmspawn> Lance Henriksen played Bishop in multiple Alien franchise movies. Of his most recent V/O jobs was as the painter in Detriot: Become Human.
[0:59:42] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS NOT EYE SEARING ORANGE YEAY
[0:59:42] <ethey16> @patstaresat you plan on 100 percenting each game?
[0:59:42] <+Raspada_Ryner> Who has Ashley or Kaiden as their favorites?
[0:59:45] <%AzureGale> @MightyDuckShoes No, you got an apartment in ME1 and that's about the extent of it
[0:59:47] <dero45> i just go full biotic team
[0:59:51] <aiutare47> I ran that way in the beginning but then it came down to whos the most fun
[0:59:54] <thelonechris> Oh no, the Mako
[0:59:55] <%JobbedBone> SAME
[0:59:56] <%BigCoffee> and the mission banter? don't you want to hear new kind of banter?
[1:00:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> UhhhhhBased Garrus?
[1:00:01] <penitentpendant> I did my first run of my game choosing squad based off of their one liners. That was probably harder than it needed to be.
[1:00:04] <peachy996> The bumpy terrain was worse than the Mako itself imo
[1:00:04] <%dankjerri> he should.
[1:00:05] <+shapeforn> Uh huh...
[1:00:08] <+glgzephyr> time for rock hacking
[1:00:08] <Mattais88> Garrus is just Dirty Harry
[1:00:08] <wasdsf> garrus "due process" vakarian
[1:00:09] <%Lizard0TM> Pat, will you make a Death God Garrus for ME3?
[1:00:09] <peachy996> Like look at this shit
[1:00:09] <%templar010> Vanguard Shep, Rex, and Tali tear it up
[1:00:10] <%Monkeyweed21> as long as its not the humans
[1:00:11] <peanutdot007> He was afraid for his life Pat
[1:00:12] <+even_the_yuenglings> its not like he becomes a vigilante or something
[1:00:15] <Ipsenscastle> decrypt these minerals
[1:00:19] <%Rumbutt> ROCK: HACKED
[1:00:20] <SiameseSneeze> Hack the mineral
[1:00:22] <%derpy_platypus> Hack those rocks
[1:00:24] <Ipsenscastle> they're cryptominerals
[1:00:25] <%templar010> HACK ROCK
[1:00:25] <%saadi90> I like Garrus in 3
[1:00:27] <CastellanVon> I take who I like unless it's Insanity then I gotta pick whose good for the mission.
[1:00:28] <ioci2112> hack the rock
[1:00:33] <%sniffy77> hack the planet
[1:00:34] <+Raspada_Ryner> Have you tried the old Mako controls?
[1:00:34] <%Robot_Nixon_> Where's the shungite
[1:00:35] <%Treuan> Hack the planet!!
[1:00:37] <%dankjerri> theres bitcoin in them hills
[1:00:38] <%JamesCorck> Garrus's character arc in this series, if going with paragon Shepard, is to step away from the ACAB axiom.
[1:00:42] <%bread_assassin> Pat.....Wrex LITERALLY murders a surrendering enemy and Garrus is appalled by that.
[1:00:45] <+MightyDuckShoes> @azuregale I know for a fact I got that DLC way back and my mind deleted all of that experience.
[1:00:47] <aiutare47> Garrus is uncool at the beginning but you can kinda fix him, the longer you travel with him the more he chills out.
[1:00:47] <%JobbedBone> vigilantes are just ahead of the curve Kappa
[1:00:49] <peanutdot007> Computers are made of rocks so rocks are actually just big computers

[1:02:18] <peanutdot007> @dankjerri Zangief gave up that ability to gain more POWER
[1:02:25] <fritz_dacat> Is there a time that dog doesn’t leak
[1:02:26] <+glgzephyr> wait but her decryption is maxed?
[1:02:29] <%JobbedBone> those are power puddless
[1:02:29] <%SaiyanShoto> Never a dull moment with Gief around

[1:03:02] <balthazar758> dog 🐶
[1:03:03] <%Varlinator> This is why I always take Garrus for electronics & Tali for Decryption
[1:03:06] <AluxStreams> It's okay if you miss some of those, the game has more of each collectible than it takes to complete the quest anyway.
[1:03:10] <fritz_dacat> psaBougie

[1:03:12] <%walternatorz> Gief will now expect birthday treats every day.
[1:03:13] <%dankjerri> garrus 'blue turians matter' vakarian
[1:03:19] <$Wurmspawn> BTW: Pat when you were rescuing Liara, you were having trouble with that Geth thing that was shooting through your barrier. That's because you were effectively fighting a non-moving Geth version of your Mako and it was using it's cannon shot to evaporate you the same way you just did to those randos.
[1:03:24] <%BoxNavy> why not
[1:03:24] <%templar010> They were there
[1:03:25] <thelonechris> Yeah, fuck your tank!
[1:03:26] <+glgzephyr> don't ask such questions
[1:03:27] <%logoth_> Cause its fun
[1:03:27] <aiutare47> they shot first
[1:03:28] <SiameseSneeze> they shot first
[1:03:28] <Chaos_Aether> They shot back
[1:03:29] <+LemonyLilly> they shot first to be fair
[1:03:31] <AluxStreams> They shot you.
[1:03:32] <peachy996> cuz they were red dots
[1:03:32] <%Canti510> They shot first
[1:03:33] <%BigCoffee> they shot first
[1:03:34] <Pookiedaexzile> They shot first
[1:03:34] <dero45> because they shot at you
[1:03:34] <peanutdot007> Because you're a cop
[1:03:35] <%walternatorz> you should have waited then shot them
[1:03:35] <%Treuan> It's the division!
[1:03:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Why you shouldnt
[1:03:39] <peachy996> Red Dots = EVIL
[1:03:40] <wolverinewaswrong> pat what mako controls are you using
[1:03:41] <%Varlinator> They drew 1st blood
[1:03:43] <ape_hawk> did you see the no mans sky update news?
[1:03:44] <Sol_Install> They legit shot first at you
[1:03:44] <%JobbedBone> ours is not to ask why, pat
[1:03:45] <+CursedNobleman> SwiftRage STAND YOUR GROUND
[1:03:46] <aiutare47> whos going to prove they didnt?
[1:03:47] <Dunmarkh> consider yourself a "looter shooter"
[1:03:47] <heartlesshealer> you wanted to steal it
[1:03:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> Castle doctrine
[1:03:48] <murdocismyhero> Jelly of the Tank
[1:03:50] <Broken_Sonex> BECAUSE THEY WERR IN THE WAY AND JUST KINDA THERE
[1:03:56] <+glgzephyr> he's using the new conttrols
[1:04:07] <%dekkitout> WAS TALI T-POSING?
[1:04:20] <tanarath> @patstaresat They totally shot first, you were forced to defend yourself!
[1:04:22] <%dankjerri> there exists no duty to retreat in space
[1:04:23] <+glgzephyr> but why!?
[1:04:30] <SiameseSneeze> oh okay, they were probably space pirates
[1:04:32] <tanarath> It was a good shoot!
[1:04:39] <heartlesshealer> wonder why =)
[1:04:39] <%SkyfireHero> they're the ones who thought it was a good idea to fire upon a fucking tank
[1:04:39] <Drunkengen> YEYEYEYE
[1:04:46] <AShinyVagikarp> ItsHappening
[1:04:46] <peachy996> NICE
[1:04:50] <$RealThiele> bonk
[1:04:50] <+glgzephyr> it always rights itself. That's what the Mako does
[1:04:52] <thelonechris> Someone get out and push
[1:04:55] <Mattais88> Always did
[1:05:00] <Dunmarkh> @glgzephyr so that looters can steal copper wiring from the sattleites
[1:05:04] <%dankjerri> WHEELIE
[1:05:05] <%Monkeyweed21> it always did
[1:05:05] <peachy996> Good Job Mako!
[1:05:05] <ape_hawk> shepard has access to the dev console
[1:05:06] <%MidnightBurst12> Safety features PogChamp
[1:05:08] <AluxStreams> Sometimes it takes entire minutes to right itself.
[1:05:09] <wolverinewaswrong> mako tsunam
[1:05:12] <Big_Dream> did he break the economy yet with he discount from the Doctor on the citadel
[1:05:15] <peachy996> You did a flip!
[1:05:21] <Pookiedaexzile> I can't believe you don't know how to drift it
[1:05:22] <%JamesCorck> Removing the Mako from ME2 was a mistake.
[1:05:22] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt You cant take fall damage in it so feel free to blast/hove straight off cliffs
[1:05:23] <%dankjerri> cause tank controls
[1:05:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Tank controls
[1:05:27] <SiameseSneeze> I love how bouncy it is
[1:05:28] <%JamesCorck> The Firewalker isn't the same.
[1:05:29] <wasdsf> the planets being basically completely empty is pretty lame tho
[1:05:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> 2
[1:05:29] <+shapeforn> it was cool to me, i think the main problem is the locations have nothing to do with it rly
[1:05:31] <Ipsenscastle> I think the only people who complained about the Mako were M&K people
[1:05:31] <peachy996> My complaint was about the bumpy ass terrain
[1:05:32] <%JamesCorck> Too restricted.
[1:05:34] <+glgzephyr> @Dunmarkh TY I did not actually expect to get an explanation from that
[1:05:35] <ioci2112> I loved the mako, it made the galaxy feel big and interesting
[1:05:38] <AluxStreams> These sequences are super chill to do with a podcast in the background or something.
[1:05:40] <peachy996> The vehicle itself was fine
[1:05:43] <%dekkitout> It's appreciation like that that gets us 85% Batmobile in Arkham Knight
[1:05:44] <Jane_Lo> instead they gave us flying mission in me2 and i genually hate them
[1:05:46] <%dankjerri> pat would be an Elite Dangerous streamer for sure
[1:05:46] <+MightyDuckShoes> just sending probes go planets sucked
[1:05:47] <dero45> im fine with the scanning in 2 mako had its place
[1:05:50] <%templar010> Yeah the FUCKING PLANETS
[1:05:50] <%pyurient> this feels like Lego Racers 2
[1:05:50] <+smuggleruncle> riding mako on planets really made me feel *in space*
[1:05:56] <peachy996> It's a flimsy tank
[1:05:57] <wasdsf> terrain paintbrush lookin ass planet
[1:06:01] <Dfreddy8> Tank made of paper
[1:06:08] <+Goliz> In some planets it is a fricking struggle to get to stuff
[1:06:10] <thetunnelhomer> Why was Bioware's responce to complaints was cutting the whole thing completely?
[1:06:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> And the Firewalker missions suck they award almost nothing
[1:06:12] <filialpails> the first mako sequence is where I stopped playing
[1:06:12] <AluxStreams> Some of these planets are like swiss cheese mountains.
[1:06:14] <%Robot_Nixon_> why aren't all these planets flat 😡
[1:06:16] <+Ploobie> these worlds are boring and lifeless, and there's no variety in the interiors with side missions. So boring.
[1:06:16] <%jaggstar2020> Bring down the sky was uncharted planet missions fully developed
[1:06:18] <peachy996> There's a planet I'm thinking of that was utter hell
[1:06:18] <%NateyBeak> let chat remember for u
[1:06:25] <%Monkeyweed21> or if the worlds werent 99% empty
[1:06:25] <peachy996> I think it was Elegia
[1:06:28] <+ThomasOfTroy> I loved the mako, I just really find scraping the map annoying (which is why I just use a map from the wikia now)
[1:06:28] <wasdsf> @filialpails lmao same
[1:06:29] <%Varlinator> Bunch of Flat Earthers complaining about the Make
[1:06:33] <%dankjerri> FUCK

[1:07:03] <%JamesCorck> Tremors time motherfuckers!!!
[1:07:08] <peachy996> Thanks Bioware for adding a visual cue to the digging underground for this
[1:07:08] <+JaseAdrift> can the worms still one shot you?
[1:07:17] <+Shubreaker> why does the mako's machine gun sound like a wet fart
[1:07:17] <peachy996> Much more improved
[1:07:19] <%dankjerri> its a mawboid
[1:07:19] <+Pequod1> if you walk without rhythm, you won't attract the worm
[1:07:22] <+Goliz> If they hit you directly
[1:07:24] <wolverinewaswrong> these are just the ankhegs from bg
[1:07:29] <%Maids4lyfe> how did the thresher maw get on other planets
[1:07:29] <%pyurient> what was the name of the big one in three?
[1:07:29] <dero45> yes
[1:07:32] <+Punchasaur> THATS A FUCKING STARFOX BOSS
[1:07:33] <%Ynkubus_> Its more of a mega bobbit worm
[1:07:34] <illtima> Was it ever explained why Thresher maws are present on so many planets?
[1:07:41] <+shapeforn> hey, i dont remember it, and im sure there is lore out there, but why are there Thresher maws on different planets?
[1:07:47] <dero45> EZ
[1:07:49] <SiameseSneeze> Electronics fuck yeah
[1:07:49] <+shapeforn> @illtima oh jinx
[1:07:49] <+redthebaron> passing the gel on the mako
[1:07:55] <ape_hawk> thresher maw is what i call my sphincter
[1:07:57] <%emperordread> I just played through ME1 for the first time without realising there was a canon on the Mako psaFist
[1:07:59] <%dankjerri> piss on the maw
[1:08:00] <+Calek> @illtima they reproduce by spores that can survive space
[1:08:01] <%Maids4lyfe> how does omnigel fix a car?
[1:08:04] <%Raikouija> @shapeforn they are born from spores
[1:08:05] <+Pequod1> they're like an interstellar invasive species aren't they?
[1:08:05] <Broken_Sonex> I like you don't kill it, it just runs away
[1:08:08] <peachy996> @illtima Spores and shit
[1:08:13] <%Daxalog> If you get out of the Mako and finish it with a gun do you get bonus EXP and not mako exp?
[1:08:14] <%RetroCop87> Wrex wants to learn how to feel again
[1:08:15] <Dunmarkh> vanguard
[1:08:17] <Ipsenscastle> @shapeforn they eject spores at escape velocity I think
[1:08:18] <%BoxNavy> carnadge
[1:08:21] <%dankjerri> LIFT
[1:08:24] <+shapeforn> oh cool
[1:08:37] <%Maids4lyfe> oh so thresher maws are mobile sarlaacs?
[1:08:42] <%Dakuu75> medium armour
[1:08:48] <+Shubreaker> no cap i'm happy this legendary edition came out cause now we get updated blender models
[1:08:50] <peachy996> yeah
[1:08:59] <aiutare47> I LOVE THE BREATH MASK
[1:09:00] <+Ploobie> Thresher Maws are weak to Kevin Bacon.
[1:09:01] <$Wurmspawn> And they are the other galaxy threatening species that is only Native to Tuchanka, (and their eggs get jestisoned into space according to the codex) but nobody felt the need to genophage them.
[1:09:04] <%dankjerri> thresher maws do sick dick flips
[1:09:04] <+Pequod1> whats pats class
[1:09:11] <ape_hawk> that armor has a dick pointing to your dick
[1:09:14] <scarman125> @PatStaresAt any plans on trying Tainted Grail: Conquest?
[1:09:18] <%templar010> The higher level First Aids get nuts
[1:09:19] <%king_wragles> Vanguard?
[1:09:20] <+wmeldrum> you have lady armor
[1:09:23] <SiameseSneeze> He's Vangaurd
[1:09:23] <%slimmixrp> You bought it
[1:09:24] <%bread_assassin> Vanguard
[1:09:28] <penitentpendant> Health regen, the most important stat (non-ironically)
[1:09:30] <%templar010> They give cooldown reduction and toxin resistance
[1:09:41] <thelonechris> Frogger-based hacking
[1:09:41] <%slimmixrp> Dusty
[1:09:48] <AthenaAegis> Thought that was a toilet lol
[1:09:55] <Ipsenscastle> Apparently there was a Thresher Maw in Andromeda??? How tf did they justify that??
[1:09:58] <%templar010> Oh its literally game changing
[1:10:01] <+shapeforn> playing ME2 right now, and the minigames are still super simple but I think are better
[1:10:03] <+alphonseisbest> no it sucks
[1:10:05] <Gorshum> It's way better.
[1:10:05] <%Lizard0TM> Yeah
[1:10:07] <+alphonseisbest> i don't like it
[1:10:09] <%Robot_Nixon_> improvement?
[1:10:10] <AShinyVagikarp> Agreed
[1:10:12] <%Lizard0TM> I was max level by Virmire
[1:10:13] <+Goliz> But at the same time I did all side quests and explored a bunch but still didn't hit max level
[1:10:14] <%Maids4lyfe> Is it a coincidence that the Krogan homeworld is called Tuchanka sounds like R6S's Tachanka?
[1:10:15] <peachy996> No there are no Thresher Maws in Andromeda
[1:10:17] <+Goliz> Maybe I did something wrong
[1:10:34] <Ipsenscastle> @peachy996 ah ok
[1:10:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> @alphonseisbest How so? Now you can reach max level in a single game?
[1:10:36] <+alphonseisbest> yup
[1:10:36] <wasdsf> crazy people don't remember this game used to be not good to play
[1:10:37] <peachy996> You're probably thinking of the Remnant worms that look like them
[1:10:37] <%Interface23> Interface23 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:10:45] <ape_hawk> thanks for that helpful insight, wrex
[1:10:47] <%Maids4lyfe> Andromeda is where all franchises go to die
[1:10:52] <dero45> it could be a bit much for new comers
[1:11:02] <%Maids4lyfe> Mass Effect, Stargate, Kevin Sorbo
[1:11:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Good shit, Pluto rounds
[1:11:07] <+alphonseisbest> i like lots of small increases, instead of one big one
[1:11:12] <%Treuan> Yes
[1:11:14] <+Pequod1> Oh man I feel that
[1:11:17] <AShinyVagikarp> @alphonseisbest you can go back to legacy xp tho so theres that
[1:11:18] <%afronooch> yeah....
[1:11:21] <+alphonseisbest> unless your on about the exp thing?
[1:11:22] <%Dakuu75> at least the textures on the planet look really nice now
[1:11:25] <peachy996> There's a cool Tech Worm in Andromeda just lazily ambling around the map
[1:11:31] <dero45> random armor and gear mods would have been cool in other games
[1:11:32] <%MisterRockett> I missed a lot of the RPG mechanics I hated the way ME2 dumbed them down.
[1:11:35] <+alphonseisbest> @AShinyVagikarp yea thats what I did
[1:11:36] <%dekkitout> Kay tanuh?
[1:11:38] <peachy996> But you're still playing Andromeda lol
[1:11:41] <thetunnelhomer> I miss armor and weapon mods.
[1:11:42] <AluxStreams> I wish ME2 and 3 still had the item hoarding/weapon upgrades/inventory management stuff.
[1:11:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> GUN
[1:11:45] <+Ghufufin> its barrel has been folded a thousand times
[1:11:45] <ape_hawk> exploring uncharted worlds is more rewarding in ME1 than it is in Andromeda
[1:11:46] <%AzureGale> Is a Katana IV better than a Katana 0?
[1:11:48] <hiddenturtle> i remember this mission
[1:11:48] <+alphonseisbest> thats a GOOD shotty
[1:11:50] <thelonechris> I kinda wanted it to be an actual katana
[1:11:52] <%Monkeyweed21> the sequel to Katana Zero
[1:12:04] <thetunnelhomer> I'm so tired of all the Andromeda gaslighting, that game was bad and still is bad.
[1:12:09] <mikesumusprime> Katana means Japanese sword
[1:12:09] <%Wallabri> hi carol b'barrel?
[1:12:11] <balthazar758> kaytana iv
[1:12:11] <+alphonseisbest> @ape_hawk which is saaad when you think about it T_T
[1:12:14] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[1:12:14] <%Pappajimbo> Polonium is 250000 more toxic that hydrogen cyinide
[1:12:16] <%AzureGale> Does the gun shoot katanas
[1:12:23] <%Robot_Nixon_> ok I was confused, I thought we were comparing ME2 leveling system to ME1. Because ME2's system was terribly simplified
[1:12:28] <%DJFakie> Is Katana Zero the story of the Empty Slot
[1:12:44] <%Maids4lyfe> polonium is how dictators and despots remove journalists
[1:12:46] <peachy996> @thetunnelhomer I still liked Andromeda more than Mass Effect 3
[1:12:47] <%MassConnect> You were saying something about things they didn't continue?
[1:12:53] <+poysendemon> X
[1:12:54] <stantheman_97> guns named after swords is so cool
[1:12:59] <peachy996> Piece a shit sequel to the two best games
[1:12:59] <+shapeforn> So real talk, I think Andromeda's combat was decent, but the systems around it were dookie. Playing thru ME2 Right now and the combat is... not great
[1:13:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kaytana?
[1:13:03] <+ArbitraryHubris> are you calling it Kaytana to trigger people?
[1:13:05] <thetunnelhomer> @peachy996 Fair, but that's not a high bar to clear.
[1:13:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kkona
[1:13:16] <peachy996> That's true
[1:13:17] <+Shubreaker> is there still no point to equip weapons you can't get trained in
[1:13:28] <+red_cuppa> i remember hating that i would run out of probes in me2 xD
[1:13:30] <%AzureGale> Why are all the shotguns named after swords
[1:13:35] <%DJFakie> Japanese Sword Gun
[1:13:46] <%AzureGale> Makes sense
[1:13:48] <+alphonseisbest> you might like andromeda pat, its nothing but this
[1:13:50] <%Dakuu75> wow... that actually makes sense
[1:13:51] <Broken_Sonex> It's really disappointing that the series didn't keep it like this
[1:13:53] <%templar010> Shotgun is Japanese for Sword
[1:14:01] <%psidefx> Big Sword
[1:14:03] <%DJFakie> Is Katana X the Daikatana
[1:14:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> T.Person that never shot a shotgun
[1:14:10] <+alphonseisbest> Theres no sway anymore which helps TONS
[1:14:11] <%AzureGale> Are they going to find the DATA MODULE
[1:14:12] <%StaceMcGate> They found a husky machine eh
[1:14:18] <peachy996> Andromeda is like this but not as satisfying and there are only a handful of planets
[1:14:22] <penitentpendant> @templar010 It explains how Doom Slayer took so naturally to it
[1:14:24] <hiddenturtle> this mission was hard on insanity
[1:14:26] <AluxStreams> Why did they impale themselves on the giant spikes?
[1:14:27] <+Goliz> Andromeda had really fun combat but the story and the animations was pure garbage
[1:14:29] <+Goliz> I couldn't stand it
[1:14:30] <+Raspada_Ryner> Their run is so dumb looking
[1:14:30] <peachy996> Also you're playing Andromeda
[1:14:34] <%templar010> Pretty much
[1:14:34] <%SataruYamate> husks on harder difficulties are huge assholes
[1:14:34] <Ipsenscastle> @shapeforn huh I've just finished replaying ME2 today and I still found the combat really satisfying
[1:14:37] <%Lizard0TM> the husk are so stupid in ME1 I love them
[1:14:40] <%jaggstar2020> the circle run doodDerp doodDerp
[1:14:42] <%Lizard0TM> look at them go
[1:14:43] <+Pequod1> thats husks for ya
[1:14:44] <Mattais88> I love that their default animation before they notice you is running around in circles
[1:14:48] <wasdsf> andromeda had cool environments and thats literally it
[1:14:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> Husks love getting shot
[1:14:55] <%NateyBeak> I love when they run in circles its my favorite
[1:14:56] <%Robot_Nixon_> they just wanna hug FeelsBadMan
[1:14:59] <ape_hawk> man, these husks are LOADED with credits
[1:15:03] <AluxStreams> Minecraft Zombies have more advanced AI than these guys.
[1:15:11] <%dekkitout> @penitentpendant "His double barrel sword of wrought iron"
[1:15:12] <%Treuan> HMMM
[1:15:18] <ioci2112> IT'S RIGHT THERE WREX
[1:15:21] <JayPastaForce> fanatic is not the word I'd use
[1:15:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> GOD WREX IS COOL
[1:15:23] <+Pequod1> Sure looks still there
[1:15:23] <BurdRightsActivist> He just ran towards you and did a 180??? what???
[1:15:24] <peachy996> Yeah the environments in Andromeda like Havarl and Elaaden are pretty good
[1:15:26] <$Wurmspawn> Got to love how the Husks idle animation is either staring blankly into space or just running about randomly all Zoidberg style.
[1:15:29] <ape_hawk> O R B
[1:15:30] <%Spydurman> its totally gone
[1:15:31] <AluxStreams> That's a shrine.
[1:15:32] <+redthebaron> wrex don't know
[1:15:33] <%UvBenServed> LONG GONE
[1:15:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nah dont think about it
[1:15:40] <%Spydurman> LOOOONG GONE
[1:15:40] <PR2047> I always forget how good the voice actors for this series are
[1:15:43] <dero45> w/e
[1:15:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Reaper Babby
[1:15:44] <$Ziegsy> I was looking away from my screen and wrex sounds so much like eyore thats what I was picturing
[1:15:46] <Dunmarkh> @BurdRightsActivist the ai is very advanced
[1:15:49] <peachy996> Although Holy fuck Elaaden is blinding
[1:15:56] <Broken_Sonex> I think it was whatever was in that thing
[1:15:56] <+shapeforn> @Ipsenscastle I find the controls a little rough and that there isnt much to do, feels like Spec Ops the line pretty much. Which isn't bad, and tbf the weapons feel good, but not interesting if that makes sense
[1:16:04] <peachy996> Yeah it is
[1:16:06] <James_Quivers> "Shep." "Wrexerd."
[1:16:08] <+alphonseisbest> YUUUUUUUUUUUUP
[1:16:16] <%HairballCT> oh boy i love hearing a piano play the same note in two different octaves over and over again :)
[1:16:16] <%CoffeeKaiju> LOL
[1:16:20] <%Treuan> I love lift so much
[1:16:21] <Oqzar> you drown in weapons though
[1:16:22] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK ITS "GETH RUINS"
[1:16:23] <thelonechris> X
[1:16:25] <+alphonseisbest> which why I like that they got rid of it in 2
[1:16:29] <%StaceMcGate> I can't wait till it's Ashley's time to shine in this playthrough psaUp
[1:16:35] <+Twinmin> Also certain teams just work really well together in ME1. ME2 playing through it now i change my team often
[1:16:36] <%SataruYamate> i didnt have a problem, since you get like a trillion different guns as loot
[1:16:40] <%Lizard0TM> Pat, don't worry about that,. In the new leveling, you'll be drowning in VIII, IX, and X weapons
[1:16:46] <CrypticMochi> I mostly had Garrus for both lock pickings, I think
[1:16:49] <ChungusQuest> it is a mystery
[1:16:51] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK AT THESE GETH VICTIMS
[1:16:51] <Jane_Lo> oh, sure, what an ending 4Head
[1:16:52] <penitentpendant> 3rd wipe on Cerberus in World of Darkness. 2 caused by people picking up chains and not attaching them. I'mma take a break and watch your stream.
[1:16:53] <AluxStreams> They impaled themselves on giant spikes I guess.
[1:16:54] <Gorshum> We may simply never know.
[1:16:59] <wasdsf> JUST CARBON DATE IT AND FIGURE OUT THE ENTIRE PLOT RIGHT NOW
[1:16:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> mystery
[1:17:00] <Dunmarkh> what
[1:17:00] <%jaggstar2020> you can continue their legend through DLC
[1:17:07] <%Puhff> mystery Keepo
[1:17:08] <BurdRightsActivist> WELL NEVER KNOW
[1:17:09] <+ThomasOfTroy> is msytery
[1:17:11] <Ipsenscastle> @shapeforn that's fair. I found the weapons and powers were all pretty distinct and powerful without feeling unbalanced but I guess it's a taste thing, and I don't habitually play too many shooters anymore I suppose
[1:17:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Geth the race so good, the writers just copied them for the Reapers
[1:17:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> What are birds? We just dont know
[1:17:18] <+alphonseisbest> @penitentpendant oof
[1:17:20] <%dekkitout> I got it- the husks traveled back in time to these old ruins!
[1:17:21] <Broken_Sonex> @wasdsf SHHHHHHHHHHH
[1:17:23] <%Dakuu75> gone long
[1:17:23] <peachy996> Some sort of...Inn Doctor Nation?
[1:17:27] <dero45> its GONE
[1:17:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> @penitentpendant I swear WoD gets worse everyday I'm tempted make a boss mechanic macro just for that raid
[1:17:35] <TomFrancis_> whenever tali says perimeter clear my heart flutters
[1:17:36] <%TheFabledAble> coxEric coxEric coxEric coxEric coxEric doogWhut doogWhut
[1:17:36] <JayPastaForce> Omn-eye
[1:17:39] <%StaceMcGate> number go up
[1:17:40] <Minorou> didn't expect a Look Around You reference
[1:17:41] <Dunmarkh> that might help
[1:17:42] <BurdRightsActivist> Om-Nigh
[1:17:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> pat plx
[1:17:46] <+spartanghost004> oh yeah that is straight up busted
[1:17:50] <%Puhff> why are you doing thT?
[1:18:02] <%DJFakie> There's some real winners and losers among the equipment brands
[1:18:03] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt Is Garrus getting no love this playthrough?
[1:18:05] <SiameseSneeze> are you really in love if you don't give your partner the best gun
[1:18:10] <penitentpendant> @alphonseisbest The worst part is someone announced themselves as a streamer. And the people who didn't attach the chain were in the same group. I can't tell if they were throwing on purpose for 'content' or not
[1:18:14] <James_Quivers> In spite of the geth NEVER converting organics into husks in their centuries long existence previously, everyone just assumes that they've started doing it now
[1:18:16] <+shapeforn> @Ipsenscastle What you do get is good, but I think having like two powers on the same global CD means its pretty much just shooting in cover most of the time, which I think Andromeda at least solved a bit with ability combos, even if the game was ass overall
[1:18:17] <dero45> wrex not using a shotgun seems so weird
[1:18:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck em
[1:18:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> Poison Bulkets cause fuck the Geneva Convention
[1:18:28] <%Paperware> Why does Wrex look like Zangief? Coincidence? I think NOT!
[1:18:43] <thetunnelhomer> Garrus is a cop, and Liara is a NERD
[1:18:43] <%DJFakie> Like some guns are literally marked as basically Economy Brand
[1:18:46] <Ipsenscastle> @shapeforn the global cooldown was a definite downgrade, that's for sure
[1:18:48] <peachy996> At least take Garrus to see Dr. Heart
[1:18:48] <dero45> garrus becomes cool in me2 anyway
[1:18:48] <%JamesCorck> Yepp.
[1:18:50] <wasdsf> gotta bring wrex to vermire
[1:18:50] <%jaggstar2020> poor Jacob
[1:18:51] <%JamesCorck> This is the way.
[1:18:52] <BurdRightsActivist> thats an ALIENNN
[1:18:54] <%Reveresao> Fair
[1:18:55] <ape_hawk> including shepard?
[1:18:55] <%bread_assassin> Ya gotta take Liara to Noveria at least @PatStaresAt
[1:18:57] <viewtifulr> just like FF
[1:18:59] <%SataruYamate> if you arent a tech class in ME 1, its very hard to not take Tali on these kinds of missions
[1:19:00] <%Monkeyweed21> do you prefer Wrex or Grunt @PatStaresAt
[1:19:02] <retrosadness> kaidan literally is the worst and i am happy when he dies everytime
[1:19:02] <%TheFabledAble> it helps that the aliens have various specialties so you can spread out your good shit for the most part
[1:19:04] <peachy996> You NEED to take Garrus to Dr. Heart
[1:19:06] <+alphonseisbest> THATS FINE UNTILL 3
[1:19:12] <penitentpendant> @MrBorisMakarov I have an alt that doesn't have ANY of the crystal tower raids unlocked so I can do alliance raid for my friends roulette and we won't get any of them.
[1:19:13] <$Wurmspawn> But Pat the ACHIEVO's!
[1:19:15] <+shapeforn> @Ipsenscastle The Vanguard spells are SUPER fun though, charge and shockwave feel great
[1:19:17] <%Robot_Nixon_> Be sure to throw Ashley in the airlock
[1:19:18] <Jane_Lo> @jaggstar2020 to be fair, bioware themselves treated him like shit
[1:19:22] <thetunnelhomer> Kaiden is boring, but Ashley deserves to be nuked.
[1:19:25] <+Twinmin> Has someone asked why the hacking and equip menu UI is so different on pc than console?
[1:19:30] <dero45> sure bring liara u psycho paths
[1:19:30] <+alphonseisbest> unless your leaving her for last
[1:19:39] <+shapeforn> o no
[1:19:41] <+tetraes> @PatStaresAt  have you seen what happens if you rescue Liara as the last thing lol?
[1:19:42] <%Lizard0TM> Pat, in the new leveling system, you'll be drowning in VIII, IX, and X weapons by Virmire
[1:19:43] <ioci2112> kaidan makes you want to call HR if you play as femshep
[1:19:45] <+red_cuppa> ur gonna kll him arent u
[1:19:45] <+ArbitraryHubris> he's a good boyfriend
[1:19:46] <thetunnelhomer> Ohno
[1:19:46] <Jane_Lo> ohh
[1:19:46] <ToneBacas> monkaS
[1:19:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @thetunnelhomer if you save Ashley in 1 you can kill her in 3
[1:19:48] <Gorshum> Noooo
[1:19:48] <+spartanghost004> your going to kill him aren't you?
[1:19:49] <+glgzephyr> Is it that he's going to die on Virmire?
[1:19:49] <AluxStreams> You're gonna save Ashley so you can shoot her in ME3 aren't you?
[1:19:49] <ape_hawk> is kaiden gonna die a hero's death?
[1:19:49] <penitentpendant> @MrBorisMakarov I can't get the alt past 5.3 content, but it's SO WORTH IT
[1:19:50] <James_Quivers> In ME3, you ALWAYS take Javik to Thessia, it's the BEST
[1:19:50] <%NateyBeak> BENCHED
[1:19:53] <+alphonseisbest> GOOD
[1:19:54] <%JamesCorck> Kaiden is so boring.
[1:19:54] <peanutdot007> Dead Carth walking
[1:19:55] <wasdsf> is it that he will have survivors guilt because you will kill ashely?
[1:19:55] <%dekkitout> Oh no does he eat puppies D:
[1:19:55] <peachy996> Dont tell me he lives
[1:19:56] <+alphonseisbest> KILL HIM
[1:19:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat. You will not let Ashley live
[1:19:58] <+glgzephyr> because that's not bad news
[1:20:03] <peachy996> Please don't let him live
[1:20:03] <%Monkeyweed21> THERE IS NOTHING THERE
[1:20:03] <BurdRightsActivist> Kaidan? You mean Karth?
[1:20:04] <Broken_Sonex> Shocker. See ya Space Carth LUL
[1:20:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Ashley must die Pattrick
[1:20:08] <+alphonseisbest> dead man walking ahahaha
[1:20:08] <%jaggstar2020> @Jane_Lo I think the game where he was featured already forgot him
[1:20:09] <Jane_Lo> @AluxStreams ohmygod, you're totally right LUL
[1:20:11] <%miguelrod777> but kaidens just boring he's not an asshole like Ashley
[1:20:11] <shadoke> Kaiden is a Manila Envelope, but at least he's not Ashley
[1:20:11] <Minorou> you can get the Kaidan and Ashley cheevos done just by doing the sidequests during your first Citadel visit
[1:20:15] <%Monkeyweed21> CARTH IS MORE INTERESTING THAN KAIDEN
[1:20:18] <Ipsenscastle> @shapeforn Vanguard feels like the canon playthrough to me haha, the charge is by far the most memorable combat mechanic in the games
[1:20:20] <ChungusQuest> Ah Virmire...that conversation might be my favorite moment in all of video games
[1:20:21] <peachy996> Ashley must be shot in 3
[1:20:23] <+glgzephyr> @Pookiedaexzile He wants to kill her himself
[1:20:24] <%Mekhet09> Pat how do catch up to Ilvl 500+ without exarch?
[1:20:28] <%StaceMcGate> Pat playing the long game of getting to kill Ashley himself
[1:20:29] <+red_cuppa> kaiden dies so that ashley won't be immortalized
[1:20:29] <$Ziegsy> wrex: Geth? Oh bother...
[1:20:34] <thetunnelhomer> Kaiden gets good in 3. Ashley never gets good.
[1:20:38] <BurdRightsActivist> We're not friends, Carth
[1:20:40] <%Lizard0TM> Please tell me you're keeping Carth^2 over Ashley
[1:20:41] <James_Quivers> Pat wants to kill Ashley by his own hand in 3
[1:20:51] <AluxStreams> Ashley becomes a blow-up doll in ME3.
[1:20:53] <Jane_Lo> @jaggstar2020 yeah, i can def agree with that
[1:20:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Why do we have to wait 2 games to put her in the dirt
[1:20:58] <dero45> @Monkeyweed21 kaiden is a bro to joker bros before hoes
[1:21:01] <+glgzephyr> @thetunnelhomer But 3 has the best Ashley interaction in the franchise
[1:21:05] <%dekkitout> Ft Garry and Larry
[1:21:05] <peachy996> Yeah but you get to shoot Ashley in 3, you let her die in 1 she becomes a martyr
[1:21:05] <%JamesCorck> Mordin and Grunt?
[1:21:09] <%Reveresao> THANE
[1:21:13] <wasdsf> so maaaany good characters in ME2
[1:21:13] <geosspone> @AluxStreams I sure blew her up in ME1
[1:21:14] <+alphonseisbest> @Mekhet09 do the neir stuff and tome stones
[1:21:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> Mordin is obvious.
[1:21:16] <+Pequod1> lol really tho who tf cares about the humies
[1:21:17] <FennecZephyr> Presumably the ideal party members to bring depends on your build
[1:21:18] <%Lizard0TM> 12 party members in 2 lmao
[1:21:19] <AluxStreams> ME2's cast is crazy good.
[1:21:19] <+hmgirlpopuri> I was Mordin and Grunt with my engie shepard
[1:21:20] <Jane_Lo> me2 lineup is fucking awesome
[1:21:20] <%TheFabledAble> LEGION
[1:21:20] <+glgzephyr> Thane, Mordin
[1:21:21] <+redthebaron> grunt and legion
[1:21:22] <%Mekhet09> thane is pretty neat.
[1:21:22] <Blank9> mordin and grunt and thane and legion and
[1:21:22] <James_Quivers> MORDIN AND THANE
[1:21:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Grunt is my son and I love him
[1:21:22] <%bread_assassin> Too many choices, arguably.
[1:21:25] <peachy996> And Garrus has more personality in 2
[1:21:27] <%AzureGale> Legion OH WAIT
[1:21:28] <+D00msDayDan> you gonna let liara watch her mom die?
[1:21:29] <$Wurmspawn> I mean, I played through on PS4 with the new leveling system the whole time and I did EVERYTHING you could do before ending the game. I wasn't drowning in lvl X gear by the end of the game and not because I was selling the stuff I wasn't using.
[1:21:30] <dero45> nope just 3 jack legion and samara
[1:21:32] <peachy996> And he's hotter
[1:21:33] <wasdsf> hell yeah
[1:21:34] <%SataruYamate> Grunt, Mordin, Kasumi, Thane, Zaeed in some cases
[1:21:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> Mordin and Legion.
[1:21:35] <%DJFakie> Your friendly reminder for Quick Save (F5)!
[1:21:36] <%Monkeyweed21> MORDIN IS THE SHIT
[1:21:38] <%barrakuta371> Too bad Legion is late game
[1:21:39] <%ArchimerCXV> ME3 Sentinel is maximum squad flex
[1:21:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Grunt  must go to the Krogan Homeworld
[1:21:39] <peanutdot007> You can bring your Brobot all over
[1:21:40] <Ipsenscastle> Thane and Legion and Mordin are all top tier additions
[1:21:40] <%Mekhet09> @alphonseisbest The tomes being limited is the real issue.
[1:21:41] <%BigCoffee> except legion
[1:21:44] <mr_saturday93> No love for grunt ppl?
[1:21:44] <igatso> Love mass effect i hope them will make open world pve so we can upgrade the ships play with friends story line explore the galaxie togather and so on
[1:21:44] <+glgzephyr> shrug
[1:21:46] <illtima> I love taking Legion to the Quarians
[1:21:46] <%Treuan> D:
[1:21:51] <Blank9> nah mordin coolest member
[1:21:51] <%JamesCorck> Pat you've got to take Garrus to Mordin's loyalty mission.
[1:21:51] <+glgzephyr> the buildup is worth it
[1:21:51] <%StaceMcGate> Legion gets maybe 1 mission
[1:21:52] <wasdsf> shepard commander
[1:21:53] <retrosadness> wow yeah i just stopped to think about the companions in me2 and theyre all gas
[1:21:54] <thetunnelhomer> Grunt is my child.
[1:21:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I never beat ME2 (which was the only one I played) and I rocked Mordin and Garrus for most of it
[1:21:54] <+spartanghost004> oh in this house we stan legion
[1:21:54] <Pookiedaexzile> That's not true you get Grunt pretty early
[1:21:55] <James_Quivers> You gotta take Legion on Talis loyalty mission
[1:21:58] <%Lizard0TM> you can CHEAT and get Legion early tho for shits and giggles
[1:21:59] <James_Quivers> It's so good
[1:21:59] <NitronStreams> unless you hack the game
[1:22:00] <retrosadness> theres not one i dislike
[1:22:02] <Minorou> I was suprised at some great lines after bringing Grunt along some missions
[1:22:02] <Sp3ctre48> Legion is absolutely the coolest yes
[1:22:03] <%JamesCorck> He speaks almost entirely in badass movie one liners.
[1:22:05] <tanarath> @patstaresat you can hack/mod him in early
[1:22:07] <Ipsenscastle> Legion has so much extra dialogue you can only see between side missions after the game is over, it's stupid
[1:22:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:22:10] <TomFrancis_> lol
[1:22:10] <%BigCoffee> I forget but can you romance Samara?
[1:22:13] <%DJFakie> Not anymore!
[1:22:14] <dero45> bullshit pc race
[1:22:17] <peachy996> I had Legion and took him to all of the sidemissions after the Suicide mission was over
[1:22:19] <bellmorgu> there still is in 2
[1:22:21] <Ipsenscastle> like, AMAZING dialogue too, some of the most interesting in the game
[1:22:24] <%DJFakie> You used to have to force it!
[1:22:26] <+hmgirlpopuri> Anyone know if they fixed the bug with Kirrahe import for 2?
[1:22:26] <$Wurmspawn> No you DON'T! You CAN actually get Legion BEFORE you get Tali. It IS possible.
[1:22:28] <+DracosMagala> Yeah they fixed that
[1:22:29] <%StaceMcGate> @BigCoffee sorta not really, but you can kiss in the 3 DLC
[1:22:29] <igatso> HeyGuys
[1:22:31] <Zaktheaussie> I don't get why you'd play this game and not hang out with the characters that make the game unique
[1:22:33] <Sp3ctre48> @BigCoffee No
[1:22:35] <Oqzar> who actually uses Jacob after the first mission
[1:22:36] <+hmgirlpopuri> From the PS version of the old game that is
[1:22:37] <Broken_Sonex> @BigCoffee Nah, Blue MILF just gives blue balls
[1:22:38] <penitentpendant> @Lizard0TM Didn't they find he had dialogue for planets you couldn't get him on normally?
[1:22:40] <AluxStreams> @BigCoffee No, but ME3 Citadel has content.
[1:22:42] <%BigCoffee> @BigCoffee hot
[1:22:45] <tanarath> @bigcoffee partially, it finishes in the citadel dlc
[1:22:48] <NeroInfinite> Smara rom,ance is agame over
[1:22:50] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat You can get Legion and still bring him to Tali's recruitment mission if that's the only mission left without any consequences.
[1:22:50] <buhbuhboat> If you get Legion early crew dies
[1:22:50] <wasdsf> just save some of the sidemissions for after
[1:22:53] <peachy996> You can take him to the DLC sections
[1:22:53] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt I think the timer for Legion is 2 missions before the trigger
[1:22:53] <+alphonseisbest> @Mekhet09 it depends on what content you want to do, but u'd use the tomes that don't have a limit and then go from there tbh
[1:22:56] <ioci2112> if you don't mind your crew getting liquified you can just delay the suicide mission
[1:22:58] <AluxStreams> Legion has no mouth.
[1:22:59] <+burntbagels13> he aint got a mouth!
[1:23:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Does this Unit has a soul. Yes it does
[1:23:00] <+ArbitraryHubris> so brave
[1:23:01] <+D00msDayDan> use a save editor to unlock him as a party member right away
[1:23:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I never got Legion in ME2.... never got that far
[1:23:02] <Ipsenscastle> kiss him on the lightbulb
[1:23:04] <T_Sasquatch> Isn't he like at the end of the game ?
[1:23:04] <%BigCoffee> he has a speaker
[1:23:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Leigion would not enjoy that
[1:23:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kiss it
[1:23:05] <wasdsf> kiss him on the eye lens
[1:23:05] <peachy996> You ESPECIALLY want Legion for the Overlord DLC
[1:23:06] <+redthebaron> legion romance option
[1:23:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> He dont
[1:23:09] <+alphonseisbest> you will kill everyone if you do that tho, right?
[1:23:09] <igatso> Im on legion on game pass
[1:23:10] <dero45> thats what i id u still gotta do horizon before legion
[1:23:10] <AluxStreams> Kiss him on the speaker grill.
[1:23:10] <Sp3ctre48> Legion has a very kissable lightbulb head
[1:23:11] <ChungusQuest> he has very expressive head-plates tho
[1:23:11] <%walternatorz> Does this unit have a mouth?
[1:23:11] <RaidenRising> usb port
[1:23:11] <$renegade_blade> I haven't gotten to me2 legendary yet, did they nerf the heavy ammo in me2 or are you still able to negate the final boss fight? I remember being able to use a mix of armor and the upgrades to be able to use 2 shots with the Cain and instantly kill it
[1:23:12] <CrypticMochi> Always had Wrex/Garus or Garrus/Liara, only had Tali for the Moon thing
[1:23:13] <%Monkeyweed21> You HAVE to take Legion on the Citadel
[1:23:13] <%jaggstar2020> does this unit have a libido?
[1:23:13] <%BigCoffee> Kiss his speaker
[1:23:14] <+hmgirlpopuri> @PatStaresAt Insufficient lips, Pat-commander
[1:23:15] <+burntbagels13> kiss him on his eye light
[1:23:16] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat you toss Ashley out the airlock yet
[1:23:17] <Jane_Lo> @Ipsenscastle people got legion by mods early and it seems that he has actually early dialogue and reaction to everything, he WAS planned to be early companion in early drafts
[1:23:17] <+alphonseisbest> KISS HIS LIGHT HEAD
[1:23:19] <+Pequod1> Does this unit have a soul??
[1:23:19] <BurdRightsActivist> @buhbuhboat ????
[1:23:19] <%Lizard0TM> @penitentpendant Yes, Legion has unique dialogue for conversations that happen before Freedoms Progress lmao
[1:23:20] <$Kaiser_Loar> mouths
[1:23:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> We need to kiss it!
[1:23:21] <Chaos_Aether> @PatStaresAt he has Speakers
[1:23:26] <eolen> kiss him on the flashlight
[1:23:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Drip or Drown
[1:23:28] <TomFrancis_> kiss his robo dick
[1:23:29] <stantheman_97> kiss the flashlight
[1:23:31] <$dalmek> were it not for the limitations of your body, I would have already kissed you on the mouth
[1:23:39] <$Wurmspawn> Game sound is weird.
[1:23:39] <yourliteraldog> sup nurds
[1:23:39] <SiameseSneeze> kiss his ocular receptor
[1:23:41] <Ipsenscastle> @Jane_Lo yup yup yup, it's tragic
[1:23:43] <igatso> Runs noooooo kissing 🏃🏻♂️
[1:23:45] <$Wurmspawn> It's sounding warpy.
[1:23:47] <%Garthunox> he has somewhere his voice originates
[1:23:55] <dero45> yea 100% shit
[1:24:08] <%dekkitout> Kryme Tyme?
[1:24:14] <ioci2112> deez
[1:24:22] <Ipsenscastle> Dis, or Dat?
[1:24:22] <%StaceMcGate> I remember how much probing sucked in ME2
[1:24:22] <peachy996> Dis nut
[1:24:23] <Sp3ctre48> I may be wrong but Legion has a lot of early dialogue because I think the original plan was for Legion to take Shepard back to the Geth after the Normandy was first destroyed
[1:24:24] <Jane_Lo> oh man, this music, it heals my soul
[1:24:28] <%Garthunox> not true, some are down on planets
[1:24:28] <AthenaAegis> DIS gonna be gud Kappa

[1:24:47] <Jane_Lo> @Sp3ctre48 that is correct
[1:24:48] <wolverinewaswrong> ayyyyyy
[1:24:49] <%Dakuu75> "I don't gotta take this" *hang up*

[1:24:59] <+EmptyMug> Planet GME!
[1:25:00] <%Lizard0TM> Pat, have you considered using Trilogy Save Editor to have Legion early for fun dumb bullshit? Did you know he has unique dialogue for situations he literally could never normally see on a legit run?
[1:25:01] <%miguelrod777> Yeah sure
[1:25:02] <Broken_Sonex> Baby EDI
[1:25:02] <Jane_Lo> oh, hey EDI :)

[1:25:04] <%AzureGale> It's gone rampant
[1:25:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Uh huh
[1:25:05] <buhbuhboat> @buhbuhboat Recruiting Legion activates an event that makes the crew get kidnapped, if you don't do the suicide mission immediately after the crew will die so if you recruit Legion early your squad won't be ready to do the suicide mission without casualties
[1:25:08] <%miguelrod777> Kappa

[1:25:26] <%jaggstar2020> but can it run faster than a leopard?
[1:25:30] <penitentpendant> "It makes decisions instantaneously, but still totally not an AI."
[1:25:40] <%Robot_Nixon_> "We're not stupid Shepard" Kappa
[1:25:42] <James_Quivers> "I'm gonna put that thing in a sexbot for my pilot, Admiral"

[1:25:44] <%DianaTheAscian> je just said hed do it
[1:25:46] <Jane_Lo> @Lizard0TM i think these things don't work properly for L edition, for now at least
[1:25:48] <wolverinewaswrong> are you actually still in the military
[1:25:49] <%DianaTheAscian> he*
[1:25:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> He got you there Pat you are Human first

[1:26:07] <+red_cuppa> whoo!
[1:26:09] <$Wurmspawn> Does the music sound warp'y to anyone else? I might try refreshing.
[1:26:10] <+hmgirlpopuri> I love the callback to this mission in ME3
[1:26:12] <%Dakuu75> Can a Specter be demoted?
[1:26:15] <peanutdot007> You're gonna rip through most of the game yeah
[1:26:16] <tanarath> @patstaresat it's level 20ish

[1:29:15] <+MightyDuckShoes> @cyberkn They made a point of REI stating it as a planet after it turns out it's neighboring charibdis? was a mass relay

[1:30:49] <%Ynkubus_> AEIOU
[1:30:49] <+SuperKiva> did he find the rachni song yet?
[1:30:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Electronics is just computer first aid

[1:30:58] <%AzureGale> Don't fear  the Reaper
[1:30:58] <wolverinewaswrong> unfortunate name for a weapon
[1:30:59] <%Chichen> yo endwalker be lookin wild. even has reapers
[1:31:02] <AluxStreams> Why did they call a gun "Reaper?"
[1:31:02] <peanutdot007> That gun is shaped like Sovereign
[1:31:05] <%Puhff> what's the point of putting First Aid point on more than one character?
[1:31:06] <+ArbitraryHubris> turnons include weapons of destruction and first aid
[1:31:09] <$Ziegsy> CHAT whats that ps5 game they showed off that was a dude on the moon with a little girl?
[1:31:10] <+red_cuppa> i dunno the hanar exist
[1:31:12] <CrypticMochi> I always hated how the flying turrets aren’t affected by movement based biotics
[1:31:21] <thelonechris> Earth is the Florida of the ME universe
[1:31:22] <+fetrigon> @pookiedaexzile I don get it?
[1:31:26] <penitentpendant> It's, unironically, nice when a game conjures emotions (besides frustration). It means the writing/design is good enough to have weight.
[1:31:31] <+spartanghost004> Yes
[1:31:33] <+glgzephyr> yes
[1:31:37] <RaidenRising> ye
[1:31:37] <penitentpendant> I think so?
[1:31:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> yes
[1:31:40] <+red_cuppa> think so
[1:31:42] <+glgzephyr> yep
[1:31:42] <penitentpendant> It does
[1:31:42] <%Lizard0TM> give Tali Shotguns, that's what she's trained for
[1:31:47] <+Raspada_Ryner> I think only when you equip them
[1:31:47] <%AncelDeLambert> here's hoping for mods
[1:31:48] <Drunkengen> Cant you Unequip weapons?
[1:31:48] <+spartanghost004> manual
[1:31:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> And thats a good thing Kappa
[1:31:50] <$Wurmspawn> I think that they default to wahtever you just changed out in their equipment.
[1:31:52] <%jaggstar2020> @Ziegsy Pra or Progmata?
[1:31:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> Auto
[1:31:53] <+glgzephyr> make em switch
[1:31:55] <+red_cuppa> make em
[1:31:55] <andrewofbob> Designers thought ARs are the best gun, when they're really not
[1:31:56] <heartlesshealer> I think so yeah
[1:32:00] <wolverinewaswrong> no wonder the quarians lost against the geth
[1:32:03] <penitentpendant> I remember having to manual change them often
[1:32:03] <%AncelDeLambert> can you just unequip anything you don't want?
[1:32:07] <wolverinewaswrong> can't even choose the best weapons
[1:32:08] <+alphonseisbest> MAKE EM
[1:32:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> make em
[1:32:14] <+Pequod1> Late game ARS are just lasers
[1:32:18] <$Ziegsy> @jaggstar2020 THANK YOU
[1:32:20] <dero45> no unequip
[1:32:26] <+hmgirlpopuri> You can't unequip slots until ME3, I think
[1:32:50] <ChungusQuest> Can you force unequip by melting down their currently equipped weapon?
[1:32:52] <$Wurmspawn> Sorry.

Finished another week training Oculus agents and need to de-stress, and was pleased to see you streaming. The Space/Probe minigame thing was so cool, I'd play a game that was just that but expanded. Hope you/the family are well, please boop the Elmo/Gief!
[1:32:55] <%jaggstar2020> @Ziegsy psaUp
[1:33:13] <wasdsf> cant you switch from the weapon wheel?
[1:33:18] <$renegade_blade> change his sniper to check?
[1:33:18] <andrewofbob> ME3 makes a point that loading up more guns impacts your ability usage
[1:33:20] <$Wurmspawn> I thought it was an equip pattern, because that's what I seemed to notice.
[1:33:21] <+redthebaron> let's do some moon stunts
[1:33:33] <+RancidNaners> haven't caught the earlier bits, what build is pat? vanguard?

[1:34:36] <ChungusQuest> FEEL THE WEIGHT
[1:34:49] <%DJFakie> You know, Garrus can also do both perochScheme
[1:34:56] <NitronStreams> who put bombs on the moon?
[1:35:09] <viewtifulr> who else
[1:35:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah but Garrus isn't dummy thicc
[1:35:13] <heartlesshealer> I wonder who would put bombs on the moon
[1:35:13] <rekinom> Gotta be a mod for taht
[1:35:17] <penitentpendant> One of the primary reason I went 'Engineer' in my first playthrough of Mass Effect was so I could bring any party member I want and still have access to all loot.
[1:35:17] <wasdsf> you can set what they are using on the weapon wheel?
[1:35:23] <$Wurmspawn> There's a guy in ME2 that grills 2 soldiers about NOT just shotting a gun in space because "you are ruining someone's day."
[1:35:28] <Dfreddy8> Space Russia
[1:35:30] <peachy996> Garrus has a nice body tho
[1:35:30] <%DJFakie> To be honest they rarely switched off for me, maybe a bug?
[1:35:31] <TioXyco> don't you have to "force" them to change weapons?
[1:35:32] <%Monkeyweed21> it takes 2 seconds to swtich
[1:35:40] <peachy996> He kinda bad doe
[1:35:44] <%dekkitout> This moon isnt haunted or secretly a giant robot, is it?
[1:35:46] <%AncelDeLambert> oh man, THIS mission
[1:35:48] <%MassConnect> I just went engineer because I was an engineer
[1:35:51] <aiutare47> It’s a great copypasta I’d be surprised if Pat didn’t know it
[1:35:54] <andrewofbob> Does the Mako still give you an xp penalty?
[1:35:56] <Drunkengen> NO
[1:36:03] <wasdsf> he's using advanced tactics!
[1:36:03] <LunarRemix> Only you Shepard
[1:36:03] <Pookiedaexzile> No We need a Spectre

[1:36:12] <Dunmarkh> @andrewofbob nope
[1:36:13] <ChungusQuest> these are clearly SPECTRE skills at work
[1:36:15] <penitentpendant> If they didn't have a Mako, it'd be... kinda slightly harder?
[1:36:17] <AluxStreams> Hackett's going to ask you to go grocery shopping for him next.
[1:36:21] <penitentpendant> Not much though.
[1:36:21] <peanutdot007> Three random people in a tank are more then all earth based assets
[1:36:23] <thelonechris> Shepard has the curse of being the main character, so it has to be him
[1:36:25] <$Wurmspawn> Yeah, they could've but Hackett is trying to power-level Shepard.
[1:36:25] <teefpal> Tali and Garrus best team
[1:36:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Honestly most of the human missions feel like "Well we have a human spectre we wanna use him too"
[1:36:34] <wolverinewaswrong> This is the scariest mission in the game
[1:36:35] <%Rumbutt> Driving a MAKO on the moon is illegal, so they needed a Spectre because you're allowed to break the law, duh
[1:36:38] <+D00msDayDan> @Ziegsy i'd rather drive the original mako than the goddamn SRVs in elite dangerous
[1:36:40] <wolverinewaswrong> Find the rachni song pat
[1:36:46] <teefpal> Sadly by making ME1 better it makes ME2 and 3 much worse by comparison.
[1:36:51] <andrewofbob> Lovely, I don't need to step outside to pistol whip threasher maws for disrespect bonus
[1:36:57] <%jaggstar2020> We lost at least 6 Jenkins on the moon
[1:37:01] <heartlesshealer> Pat, have you looked at people trying to drive? I doubt anyone making it to the point of getting a Mako would know what to do with it
[1:37:01] <peachy996> This is a great track too
[1:37:08] <wasdsf> @teefpal ME2 still best, fight me
[1:37:10] <peachy996> The whole soundtrack to ME1 is so good
[1:37:11] <TomFrancis_> these assault drones are adorable
[1:37:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Someone seems to be slowing the team down
[1:37:15] <%DianaTheAscian> I would have thought humanity would have built like a massive city by this point on the moon
[1:37:17] <%JobbedBone> "send in the guy with infinite money and authority from the space government" sounds like a great power
[1:37:18] <%DJFakie> Don't forget to F5 these things can hurt quick
[1:37:20] <andrewofbob> Who stuck medigel in the drones?
[1:37:27] <aiutare47> I have a theory that these are tests of Shepard’s loyalty to humans. Hackett doesn’t need you to do his laundry, but he’s going to ask to see if you still will take orders.
[1:37:34] <%Lizard0TM> Pat, just so you know, there's a bug on this mission, that if you park the mako too close to the entrance buttons, the game freaks out and you essentially get kinda soft locked until you save and reload
[1:37:52] <$Wurmspawn> shepard....
[1:38:00] <penitentpendant> @wasdsf In every aspect? Or combat? I liked the worldbuilding in 1 more, but they combat and flow better in 2.
[1:38:04] <+fetrigon> shepard....
[1:38:06] <TioXyco> @Wurmspawn Wrex
[1:38:09] <thelonechris> G A S
[1:38:12] <%saadi90> Shepard.... Wrex
[1:38:14] <%dekkitout> Poison poison poison
[1:38:14] <heartlesshealer> codex....
[1:38:15] <peanutdot007> Oh no Fart Gas!
[1:38:18] <%AzureGale> Is it a neruotoxin
[1:38:18] <%Robot_Nixon_> GAS
[1:38:20] <%SwdVengeance> Poison Poison Poison
[1:38:20] <AluxStreams> @aiutare47 Hackett absolutely needs you to go to the store for him and get him a Pot Noodle.
[1:38:21] <+glgzephyr> GOTTA SEND IN A SPECTRE FOR THIS
[1:38:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Poison poison poison
[1:38:26] <+CammerTime21> GYASS
[1:38:29] <Minorou> you have space suits on, why is this a problem
[1:38:29] <$Wurmspawn> shepard...
[1:38:33] <peanutdot007> Also you're wearing a space suit how is that a problem?
[1:38:34] <SiameseSneeze> is your regenerating health negating it
[1:38:35] <+chiazam> Deadly neurotoxin
[1:38:40] <andrewofbob> Oh no, if only I was wearing an EVA suit
[1:38:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Shepard runs like a Dad who just saw his kid eat something off the ground
[1:38:48] <%Lizard0TM> SHUT UP THO
[1:38:54] <%Monkeyweed21> carnage is shotty only
[1:38:55] <Broken_Sonex> @aiutare47 It's absolutely compulsory
[1:39:03] <penitentpendant> Deadly Neurotoxin? In a facility for testing? Was this a GLaDoS VI?
[1:39:06] <wasdsf> @penitentpendant I think 1 is great for showing off the universe for the first time but going and seeing the quarian fleet and inhabited locations other than the citadel helps ME2's worldbuilding a lot
[1:39:09] <rekinom> @Pookiedaexzile That is a perfect description
[1:39:29] <andrewofbob> Hit the gym, Shepherd
[1:39:43] <penitentpendant> This is a mission that worked around it's limitations
[1:39:59] <Reverend_Godshyne> I've lost a lot of progress here because of that
[1:40:02] <AluxStreams> You can't Red Ring Of Death a PS4 though so...
[1:40:03] <%jaggstar2020> what a ventilation system, it comes with minty fresh and neurotoxin breeze
[1:40:13] <+FelIian> I was about to say I've never seen the fatigue meter, then I remembered that I changed the ini to make Shepard have unlimited sprint
[1:40:16] <%DJFakie> I remember it didn't used to autosave on this mission TBH
[1:40:26] <ethey16> @patstaresat how was the sprinting in 2 and 3? can't remember
[1:40:27] <+OmegaWeltall> I hear the fat boy, and Zangeif's snoring too Kappa
[1:40:42] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't remember the doors having an opening dng
[1:40:45] <%AncelDeLambert> *ding
[1:40:59] <Pookiedaexzile> There he did it
[1:41:00] <%jaggstar2020> @OmegaWeltall doodLUL
[1:41:05] <%DJFakie> @ethey16 In 3 you could run effectively forever
[1:41:26] <Profmcstevie> Fucking half life sounding footsteps
[1:41:26] <+FelIian> 2 sprinting is notoriously bad
[1:41:33] <TioXyco> ME2 killed many things ME1 had, but thank god ME2 gave us biotic charge
[1:41:38] <peachy996> Now it will have shields
[1:41:40] <wolverinewaswrong> how does poison work?
[1:41:45] <wolverinewaswrong> you're wearing a breather mask
[1:41:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait step to the side
[1:41:50] <peachy996> Making it slightly more annoying and tedious
[1:41:51] <%SuckerPunchSyd> SuckerPunchSyd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! Holy shit 29 months! Missed messaging the last two but no matter! Hope you’re having fun with mass effect to say but say hi to Elmo and Zangief for me. You said wrex was one of your favorites but do you have another that your gonna keep in your party?
[1:41:59] <ARDM112> I love how THIS is supposed to be EDI LUL
[1:41:59] <T_Sasquatch> I just realized that i don't run when playing mass effect unless i need cover LUL
[1:41:59] <%DJFakie> Shields are a pain cos of doors
[1:42:02] <%AbnormalVoid> ! POISON !
[1:42:03] <penitentpendant> Praise the health regen!
[1:42:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why pat shoost machine box?
[1:42:08] <peanutdot007> Better open these metroid prime doors
[1:42:11] <+glgzephyr> wouldn't your bar be green?
[1:42:15] <ape_hawk> i bet shepard feels like a real quarian rn
[1:42:19] <James_Quivers> G A S
[1:42:19] <+glgzephyr> oh there it is
[1:42:19] <AluxStreams> The poison damage is supposed to ignore your shields so I dunno what's going on. lol
[1:42:24] <James_Quivers> SMELLY SMELLS
[1:42:28] <teefpal> Samus Shepard mod would be cool
[1:42:30] <CosmicApe13> Is the remaster worth buying?
[1:42:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Its the only other weapon you're good at
[1:42:43] <+FelIian> they get hit a lot in ME 2
[1:42:45] <Dfreddy8> Just dont stand too close to the junctions
[1:42:46] <wasdsf> @James_Quivers GAS
[1:42:46] <DatAsuna> pistol have to be strong cause in the OG game some calsses had to rely on them
[1:42:51] <%isa_sensei96> Buggy
[1:42:52] <%Lizard0TM> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYYE
[1:42:52] <Pookiedaexzile> as a vangaurd
[1:42:54] <%templar010> ooooh YEAH
[1:42:54] <thelonechris> YEAH
[1:42:56] <DatAsuna> can't afford to have bad pistols
[1:42:57] <%Treuan> What have you done
[1:42:58] <TomFrancis_> ????
[1:42:59] <SiameseSneeze> this fuckin bug
[1:42:59] <peachy996> Nice one
[1:42:59] <xcompleasedad> Shake dat
[1:43:00] <aiutare47> oooooooh
[1:43:00] <teefpal> oh no not this bug again
[1:43:03] <%Lizard0TM> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:43:04] <%MidnightBurst12> Oh no
[1:43:06] <DatAsuna> yeyeye it's still in
[1:43:06] <Pookiedaexzile> 2007
[1:43:06] <+FelIian> this happens a lot
[1:43:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why Pat shoot box? Me am confus?
[1:43:08] <penitentpendant> Woolie Powers are GO
[1:43:10] <thelonechris> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:43:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ha
[1:43:15] <+FelIian> quick save and reload @PatStaresAt
[1:43:15] <ape_hawk> huh
[1:43:16] <peachy996> Still a Bioware Product Baby!
[1:43:16] <Pookiedaexzile> 2 0 0 7
[1:43:17] <%NateyBeak> didnt quietshy get this
[1:43:20] <AluxStreams> @CosmicApe13 These remasters are some of Bioware's best work since releasing these games originally, absolutely worth it.
[1:43:21] <tanarath> FUCK YEAH
[1:43:23] <blue8moon> hmmm
[1:43:30] <+D00msDayDan> oh hell yeah this bug
[1:43:30] <Vyskus> Is uh, there a reason there's no music
[1:43:32] <%thebeargoesHONK> is this fem shep?
[1:43:34] <thelonechris> Sideways playthrough
[1:43:38] <%MidnightBurst12> what ?
[1:43:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Bio Magic
[1:43:47] <+wvuboii> I only know how to fix that bug on playstation by holding the PS button lmao
[1:43:50] <Dfreddy8> The Remaster os still buggy AF
[1:43:51] <peachy996> This mission has sparse music
[1:43:53] <tanarath> bioware magic!
[1:43:53] <+FelIian> @thebeargoesHONK nah it's Uncle Pat Shep
[1:43:55] <FutaSnek> Is it good?
[1:43:55] <SiameseSneeze> all 3 games, all DLC
[1:43:57] <wasdsf> not nearly as jank as those batman arkham remasters
[1:43:57] <peachy996> It's normal
[1:43:58] <TioXyco> haha massive
[1:44:00] <FutaSnek> Shit may have to grab it
[1:44:01] <Vantesla> Pistols in ME1 and especially the original and not remaster was the best DPS firearm. Especially in original with certain classes able to use Aim near all the time. They slightly nerfed Aim and specifically Immunity.
[1:44:02] <$Wurmspawn> I really appreciate the work they put into this.
[1:44:06] <Pookiedaexzile> ME 1 is bad by todays standards
[1:44:08] <DatAsuna> It's not the full on remake we wanted but it's a step upo
[1:44:09] <ape_hawk> mess effect
[1:44:11] <ape_hawk> nailed it
[1:44:12] <%AzureGale> The ME1 remaster's HUD looks SO MUCH better
[1:44:13] <Pookiedaexzile> but I love it all teh same
[1:44:18] <andrewofbob> You had to fight through pain to enjoy OG1
[1:44:23] <peachy996> I'll enjoy the remaster when they put the multiplayer in
[1:44:23] <FutaSnek> As long as its more playable then the origional
[1:44:23] <+Shubreaker> it had a mass effect 😎
[1:44:31] <T_Sasquatch> i never had any bugs when i played the triology on pss this year
[1:44:32] <+alphonseisbest> thats not a valid response Pat
[1:44:34] <$Wurmspawn> ESPECIALLY since they could've gone full EA and made everyone pay for the DLCs all over again, but they didn't.
[1:44:34] <teefpal> People who call this buggy have never played a truely buggy game in their lives.
[1:44:34] <DatAsuna> None of the OG trilogy have controller support on PC and that's dumb
[1:44:39] <$KetsuoTaberu> They never patched out the "equip any armor" exploit in ME1 Legendary Edition
[1:44:43] <AluxStreams> The jank is part of ME1's charm and they haven't sucked that out of it. They've just improved what already just about worked.
[1:44:45] <DatAsuna> The fact we needed mods for controller support before this
[1:44:48] <teefpal> Try playing Fallout 3 w/o mods
[1:44:52] <%jaggstar2020> allways thought X-Com combat whould really suit this franchise
[1:44:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Mass Effect Multiplayer never lived up to its full potentional
[1:44:54] <xcompleasedad> Becasue get fuckled?
[1:44:58] <%DJFakie> Later levels cut down points
[1:45:05] <peachy996> @KetsuoTaberu That's good to hear
[1:45:06] <HaroldDonchee> wow that garrus helmet looks dumb
[1:45:08] <DatAsuna> ME3 MP was so good by the end
[1:45:15] <%DJFakie> You will later gain only 2 as well
[1:45:16] <%JamesCorck> After level 10 the squad mates only get 2 points per level, right?
[1:45:16] <CosmicApe13> I liked the horde mode in ME3 online
[1:45:18] <+glgzephyr> what, are there white checks you want to retry later?
[1:45:18] <Pookiedaexzile> it could have been Gears with powers but it was always too slow and wall bouncing never was smooth
[1:45:20] <%psidefx> Galaxy brain move
[1:45:27] <Archmortal> iirc it happens to Shepard eventually too.  As you level up more you get less
[1:45:28] <aiutare47> It was great
[1:45:32] <TourettesPlays> These stock warehouses in ME1 are top comfy
[1:45:37] <mak0t0yukii> Pat bring it back
[1:45:37] <wasdsf> that multiplayer was so awesome
[1:45:38] <AluxStreams> There was more money in FIFA.
[1:45:39] <DatAsuna> Because bioware motnreal is dead and they made the MP
[1:45:39] <$KetsuoTaberu> @peachy996 100%, and you best believe I'm taking full advantage of it in my playthrough LUL
[1:45:40] <xcompleasedad> Because EA hates moral money
[1:45:41] <%Monkeyweed21> oof
[1:45:42] <LunarRemix> It did come back in Andromeda, no?
[1:45:42] <rekinom> Because corporate stopped mandating it
[1:45:45] <+SuperKiva> servers are still live
[1:45:45] <teefpal> It was one of the best things about ME3
[1:45:46] <%DJFakie> Because Play Andromeda multiplayer
[1:45:47] <%emperordread> Multi-player? More like Multi-failure amirite? (idk I never played it)
[1:45:48] <+FelIian> they are thinking about it
[1:45:49] <+alphonseisbest> CUZ BIOWARE ARE COWARDS
[1:45:49] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU GOT TO PLAY AS VOLUS
[1:45:50] <xcompleasedad> IMMORAL money? Loves it
[1:45:50] <%Lizard0TM> The only way to get it is to buy the bundle that has ME:LE AND ME3
[1:45:50] <James_Quivers> I heard rumors they wanna add it back soon
[1:45:51] <+D00msDayDan> please understand
[1:45:51] <DatAsuna> So everyone who made ME3 MP is gone
[1:45:52] <@SSaryn> Part of the reason I didn't play it. Also probably cause they thought it wasn't enough people to monetize off it.
[1:45:52] <%hax_metatron> Do the remasters have multiplayer?
[1:45:53] <aiutare47> no clue why they killed it. Probably didnt want to run servers
[1:45:53] <peachy996> Yeah well if they put it back in I'll buy the LE until then
[1:45:55] <%VioletHeart> Apparently it was "too hard" to reimplement. I personally think it was so reliant on loot boxes that they couldn't be bothered to rework it.
[1:45:55] <wasdsf> it still looks good too!
[1:45:58] <T_Sasquatch> because they need to fit in microtransactions and lootboxes
[1:45:58] <+shapeforn> The Dragon Age Inquistion MP wasnt too bad either, weirdly enough
[1:45:59] <+fetrigon> what about Andromeda
[1:45:59] <%SkyfireHero> I would actually buy loot boxes for it cause I enjoy it
[1:46:01] <Thepothero> It’s still on pc
[1:46:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They said they might add it later
[1:46:04] <chicken_apostle> it's funny how people like maass effect
[1:46:07] <TourettesPlays> Shooting these VI conduits is always such a drag JUST EXPLODE IN ONE SHOT PLS
[1:46:07] <DatAsuna> Standalone ME3 MP would be welcome tbh
[1:46:08] <+alphonseisbest> PLS
[1:46:10] <%Raikouija> There is a rumor they will put it back in
[1:46:12] <aiutare47> YOU GOT TO PLAY AS A KROGAN WITH A BIOTIC HAMMER
[1:46:13] <+alphonseisbest> It was so good!
[1:46:18] <peachy996> Andromeda's MP isn't the same as 3's MP
[1:46:18] <%Monkeyweed21> ME3 Mercenaries
[1:46:26] <%MassConnect> What planet is Eorzea? Or is Eorzea the planet?
[1:46:29] <stormhawk9891> I forgot how creepy this particular song was
[1:46:30] <DatAsuna> @fetrigon andromeda mp was a good foundation but it didn't get the post launch support me3 mp did for obvious reasons
[1:46:31] <teefpal> Garrus is trying his best
[1:46:31] <$Wurmspawn> The ME3 MP didn't come back because it was packaged in a series that had been Single player until EA wanted to start loot boxing the game.
[1:46:33] <James_Quivers> The loot box stuff in the original wasn't bad at all, part of the reason it's so well loved. God DAMN I miss ME3 multiplayer
[1:46:34] <wasdsf> it SUCKS
[1:46:34] <CrypticMochi> They’re probably trying to push you towards the Andromeda multi
[1:46:34] <peachy996> It's a different kind of shootan
[1:46:34] <%Lizard0TM> it's not good
[1:46:35] <+FelIian> the Whip Adept character was my favourite by far
[1:46:35] <Dfreddy8> And a GETH PRIME
[1:46:35] <aiutare47> it did?
[1:46:40] <peachy996> It's okay.
[1:46:43] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why Pat shoot box?
[1:46:44] <$KetsuoTaberu> It did, and it was broken as fuck on release
[1:46:45] <CosmicApe13> I didn't bother with Andromeda, it looked like shit
[1:46:45] <ChungusQuest> @Monkeyweed21 fuck yes
[1:46:46] <wolverinewaswrong> HELP
[1:46:46] <%DJFakie> The binary says "HELP", no joke.
[1:46:47] <andrewofbob> There were some exclusive abilities in the multiplayer. Fury Adept was mad fun handing out explosions like they're going out of fashion
[1:46:47] <T_Sasquatch> Apart from reselling it I dont see the monetary incentive that would make the game last
[1:46:48] <%afronooch> H E L P
[1:46:48] <tanarath> IT HAD MULTIPLAYER
[1:46:51] <+JaseAdrift> Im 100% fine that the multiplayer isnt in the game become now i cant be forced to play it
[1:46:51] <peachy996> Janky and slippery
[1:46:51] <%isa_sensei96> "Help"
[1:46:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Just hire Gears Allumi to make the new game have good MP with Wallbounces that feel good
[1:46:53] <tanarath> W H A T
[1:46:54] <Yakobro> @PatStaresAt wow you killed edi!
[1:46:55] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i played andromeda and i didn't know that game had multiplayer
[1:46:56] <+critikal_bit> HELP
[1:46:57] <+Mutanthunter> literally got to play as all the aliens in MP
[1:46:57] <Sigma_190_Beta> Oh, hey it says HELP
[1:46:57] <aiutare47> H E L P
[1:47:00] <wolverinewaswrong> HELP!!!
[1:47:00] <teefpal> ROBO MURDER
[1:47:01] <peachy996> 3 is the better multiplayer
[1:47:03] <wolverinewaswrong> HELP
[1:47:04] <ape_hawk> BE SURE TO DRINK YOUR SPACE OVALTINE
[1:47:05] <DatAsuna> MEA MP without any DLC was better than ME3 MP without any DLC. But ME3 MP got 4 expansions
[1:47:06] <$KetsuoTaberu> You could equip two ammo effects, and solo platinum multiplayer missions
[1:47:09] <%Treuan> Sick
[1:47:16] <teefpal> Never saw this
[1:47:16] <%miguelrod777> huh never knew what it meant
[1:47:26] <TourettesPlays> Shock Troooper, definitely
[1:47:27] <%Treuan> S.T.A.R.S.
[1:47:27] <$KetsuoTaberu> Then they patched it out FeelsBadMan
[1:47:28] <DatAsuna> @KetsuoTaberu lone wolf club
[1:47:35] <Lamokmok> Bye AI we will never meet again
[1:47:35] <stormhawk9891> I'd go with Nemesis
[1:47:35] <%templar010> Nemesis makes Lift nuts
[1:47:37] <%Puhff> nemmy
[1:47:37] <+glgzephyr> It's nemmy for me every day
[1:47:37] <RaidenRising> stars
[1:47:39] <Pookiedaexzile> NEMESIS IS RE VILLIAN
[1:47:39] <%MassConnect> Nemesis comes with an addiction to Starrs
[1:47:42] <+Shockrates20XX> Shock Trooper
[1:47:42] <buhbuhboat> You find out this VI becomes EDI in ME3
[1:47:44] <%dekkitout> But duh starz tho
[1:47:44] <+Shockrates20XX> Run in and shotgun
[1:47:45] <TourettesPlays> Barrier is so broken in this game its not even funny
[1:47:45] <Pookiedaexzile> You have to pick it
[1:47:49] <tanarath> Probably shock trooper
[1:47:52] <Reverend_Godshyne> I always went shock trooper
[1:47:53] <$KetsuoTaberu> It was a good time for the day or so it lasted LUL @DatAsuna
[1:47:53] <Dfreddy8> There was a bug in ME3 muliplayer that let you max out your hole tree
[1:47:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> STARS
[1:47:56] <RaidenRising> BUT STARS
[1:47:57] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt Since you love Geth, you should know you could play as all the types of them in ME3 MP, even a Prime
[1:47:58] <ssks123> barrier is busted
[1:48:00] <peachy996> Oh yeah this is the progenitor to Edi
[1:48:03] <%DJFakie> Shock Trooper is the Soldier variety, it's good
[1:48:03] <+Raspada_Ryner> Nemesis is good cuz you can have shields up pretty much forever
[1:48:06] <%dekkitout> Think of it, total GALACTIC saturation
[1:48:09] <Drunkengen> STARS
[1:48:09] <Pookiedaexzile> STARS
[1:48:13] <tanarath> Bastion for Adept means you can permastun the final boss
[1:48:14] <dero45> TANK or DMG
[1:48:15] <andrewofbob> Oh, they didn't like you running 66666 builds
[1:48:15] <fritz_dacat> Show us Stars
[1:48:17] <DatAsuna> The geth primes had a straight up force choke yeah
[1:48:19] <peachy996> Bye Edi
[1:48:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Maxed out Barrier is God Mode iirc
[1:48:19] <HaroldDonchee> shock trooper sounds general while nemesis sounds more specialized
[1:48:28] <Dunmarkh> barrier only sucks because you never upgraded it?
[1:48:33] <DatAsuna> And the turian female vnguard could charge without targets
[1:48:40] <+Raspada_Ryner> You can keep Barrier up pretty much indefinitely with Nemesis
[1:48:41] <%Garthunox> @James_Quivers The Krogan were my personal favorite to play as, especially the one with the huge hammer
[1:48:44] <Pookiedaexzile> This man is gonna stomp the story missions
[1:48:45] <dero45> @Monkeyweed21 op AF
[1:48:46] <TourettesPlays> Barrier gets to the point where the regens faster than the duration lmao
[1:48:51] <$renegade_blade> you got to be a turian with a jetpack thing in one of the later me3 multiplayer dlcs and it was cool
[1:48:52] <%Monkeyweed21> MAXED BARRIER IS THE SHIT
[1:48:53] <DatAsuna> And the krogan batllemaster had the not halo 3 gravity hammer lol
[1:48:57] <AluxStreams> Playable Collector in ME3 MP was dope too.
[1:48:59] <%ssjklyco> Level 12 Shepard
[1:49:00] <Dfreddy8> S.T.A.R.S.
[1:49:03] <peachy996> The Krogan for example are way more fun in 3 than Andromeda
[1:49:07] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It will NEVER show up again
[1:49:07] <+glgzephyr> @HaroldDonchee It's more about defense vs offense
[1:49:08] <andrewofbob> Volus pinball was best multiplayer build
[1:49:09] <AngryAsian5> It will NEVER ever return again
[1:49:10] <penitentpendant> GLaDoS defeated

[1:49:27] <%Reveresao> Yea, dead as an AI can be.
[1:49:27] <LunarRemix> Shouldn't they just take some junior officers and swipe magnets everywhere?
[1:49:28] <Hellarussian> never ever
[1:49:30] <+SuperKiva> super dead, never coming back and be super hot
[1:49:30] <%Robot_Nixon_> Didn't double tap smh

[1:49:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YUP SUPER DEAD

[1:49:33] <%Monkeyweed21> IT WILL NEVER SUCK SETH GREEN'S DICK
[1:49:38] <stantheman_97> as dead as future Ashley
[1:49:39] <%JamesCorck> It totally won't come back and Joker will definitely not try to fuck her.
[1:49:40] <%AbnormalVoid> woolieSMUG
[1:49:41] <peachy996> Or your ship AI
[1:49:41] <CrypticMochi> Bastion Adept, the Biotic God and Commando Infiltrator, the Super Tank. Always played those on insanity in 1.
[1:49:42] <Dfreddy8> Bye for GOOD

[1:49:45] <%miguelrod777> definitely not as a hot ai you can't date
[1:49:46] <teefpal> Wait
[1:49:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> WHAT NO WAY!
[1:49:47] <+FelIian> I think Stasis on the Sentinel upgrade is a contender for the most op skill in the game - 18s freeze that you can damage enemies though, and affects everything
[1:49:47] <%dekkitout> It what....
[1:49:52] <teefpal> This is EDI?
[1:49:52] <%MassConnect> has there ever been a Resident Evil in space?
[1:49:52] <bharcoot> dekillKermit dekillPlan
[1:49:52] <Hellarussian> that would be insane
[1:49:53] <%Reveresao> No backups or anything left :)
[1:49:54] <TourettesPlays> OH SHIT THAT VI IS EDI????
[1:49:56] <AngryAsian5> Joker will never see it coming
[1:49:58] <Fanimusmaximus> You can’t spell EDI without I DED
[1:49:58] <dero45> HOW CAN IT EVEN
[1:49:58] <%Treuan> Good job
[1:49:59] <%Monkeyweed21> SETH GREEN WILL NEVER BANG IT
[1:49:59] <%JamesCorck> We did it!
[1:50:02] <DatAsuna> I loved playing as the n& sentinel too
[1:50:02] <Dfreddy8> He WILL FK HER
[1:50:05] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I feel very lost with these references to future games
[1:50:05] <butthurtdave> I like the Luna mission and how it sets up (character) in 3
[1:50:06] <+D00msDayDan> wait, what?
[1:50:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEATH BY SNU SNU
[1:50:10] <%JamesCorck> You missed the Rachni chants, tho.
[1:50:10] <1matheuw> what manner of kotor is this?
[1:50:14] <Samurai_Tchan> NO way ultron escaped in 2014
[1:50:14] <+SuperKiva> totally wont help pilot a ship or something
[1:50:14] <linkoftermina> !uptime
[1:50:15] <@Moobot> @linkoftermina I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 50m.
[1:50:15] <%Reveresao> @TourettesPlays  Maybe :)
[1:50:17] <%Monkeyweed21> @TourettesPlays its the progenitor for EDI
[1:50:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Dat Compussy
[1:50:20] <DatAsuna> You basically didn't even need a gun in ME3 if you had a good powers setup
[1:50:21] <%JamesCorck> There's a region on Moon where you can hear the Rachni songs.
[1:50:22] <%dekkitout> I don't knwo shit bout ME, but that'll be a fun reckoning I bet
[1:50:23] <omniv_of_g0r> It will not be played by 6 From Batttlestar Galactica...
[1:50:25] <DatAsuna> Prime and detonate
[1:50:27] <stantheman_97> dead VI got that crazy strong robo puss
[1:50:27] <DatAsuna> all day long
[1:50:28] <Pookiedaexzile> LUL
[1:50:33] <butthurtdave> Did you do the Armstrong/Tali quest yet?
[1:50:35] <ape_hawk> sure
[1:50:35] <%Treuan> Sounds good to me
[1:50:36] <ChungusQuest> FULL CONTENT
[1:50:36] <%ssjklyco> Yes
[1:50:38] <%KorieTheCoward> why would they make a robot lady with sex parts?
[1:50:38] <%Garthunox> bust up my jussy
[1:50:39] <epyonics> that's how i do it

[1:50:41] <ape_hawk> you do you, pat
[1:50:41] <DatAsuna> sidequest all day
[1:50:42] <ergulor> yeah
[1:50:42] <%walternatorz> That's cool
[1:50:43] <$Ziegsy> theres another way to play?
[1:50:43] <mikesumusprime> im good
[1:50:44] <$KetsuoTaberu> Yeah, makes sense
[1:50:44] <%JamesCorck> psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp
[1:50:44] <%CalderGaming> yeah sounds good
[1:50:45] <AluxStreams> The only bad thing about ME3 MP was having to buy an EA Online license to play it.
[1:50:47] <$apolitenoob> Seems good
[1:50:48] <+Ataraxis9> thats cool
[1:50:49] <stantheman_97> sure
[1:50:49] <viewtifulr> she just takes the part out give a ol handy to joker
[1:50:50] <+goblinking92> yes
[1:50:50] <%templar010> Yeah I did that and it was a mistake
[1:50:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Yeah I supppose it's fine..... kinda chill this way
[1:50:51] <%bhp_99> yeah
[1:50:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES SUPER DOWN
[1:50:51] <dero45> I DONT GIVE A SHIT JUST DO IT
[1:50:53] <%lemuhollow> That's the only way to play ME1
[1:50:54] <+Mutanthunter> yes thats how i did it
[1:50:55] <%NateyBeak> we are just enjoying all of this and you reminding us that everyones terrible it make me laugh
[1:50:57] <%templar010> This is the better way
[1:50:58] <Dunmarkh> it works
[1:50:59] <%JamesCorck> Do it dude, this is a good method because it works good for you!
[1:51:01] <peachy996> @DatAsuna I basically played Krogan Soldier to spam Grenades and waste as much ammo packs as I could
[1:51:01] <%dekkitout> Side quest scraping is how God intended games to be played
[1:51:02] <chancho4tierra> thats the way is suposed to be
[1:51:03] <%templar010> Also you get more gear this way
[1:51:03] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> Yes
[1:51:07] <butthurtdave> To this day I still have never gotten the Codex achievement for this game
[1:51:09] <TourettesPlays> I had to make a whole checklist to keep track of all the planets
[1:51:12] <%emperordread> I accidentally got to the point of no return and couldn't hand in my sidequests nyannScary
[1:51:13] <%JamesCorck> We're here to see you play the game, we can play it on our own later.
[1:51:15] <penitentpendant> This isn't 'new' to you so there's no rush for you to 'see' content. And the pacing is better for a couple of sides then a main, then sides.
[1:51:18] <DatAsuna> I dare say ME3 MP was the second best horde mode period. Gears ofc keeps the crown.
[1:51:24] <%captainpodock> Yeah breaking it up is probably for the best.
[1:51:28] <Samurai_Tchan> There inst any probe in this game huh
[1:51:41] <andrewofbob> I whored out sidequests in ME2 and got no deaths on the final mission 1st try
[1:51:43] <dero45> dream team
[1:51:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Team Waifu
[1:51:46] <+athuramn> we trust your intuition is the way I see it
[1:51:47] <+alphonseisbest> pat you have allllll the time in the world
[1:51:49] <+Fooguwu> AND SHE'S HOT AND CUTE
[1:51:50] <AluxStreams> Tali is a lockpick on legs.
[1:51:52] <penitentpendant> Tali, the THICCest lockpick
[1:51:52] <%DJFakie> Since there is a big ME1 break do you plan on doing the survey grinding off stream
[1:51:52] <andrewofbob> Chambers still died in 3
[1:51:52] <ape_hawk> is tali just your lockpick?
[1:51:53] <wasdsf> master of unlocking
[1:51:53] <%ssjklyco> Tali is a Key party member
[1:51:54] <$RealThiele> teen girl squad
[1:51:59] <TourettesPlays> Anyone can hack in ME2 Pat
[1:51:59] <stantheman_97> alien pussy gang
[1:51:59] <butthurtdave> You dont need characters to lockpick  in 2
[1:52:01] <+HanbaobaoZaiNar> Tali is a master of unlocking
[1:52:03] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:52:03] <thelonechris> I just saw a T pose
[1:52:03] <%AncelDeLambert> YEAH LOOK AT THAT T-POSE!!
[1:52:04] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:52:07] <peachy996> What doors in ME2 are you unlocking
[1:52:08] <+FelIian> that's not a thing in ME2
[1:52:08] <+CookieCutter007> T
[1:52:08] <FennecZephyr> Wait, you don't need skills to unlock doors in ME2
[1:52:10] <+glgzephyr> oh is that how this is gonna go down?
[1:52:11] <DatAsuna> at least he's honest
[1:52:12] <dero45> splosh
[1:52:13] <Oqzar> you dont need skills to open doors in 2
[1:52:13] <Samurai_Tchan> DONT ,,tali is just a visor
[1:52:16] <+robosqueeb> Tali Kreygasm
[1:52:17] <%MelBrooksKA> MelBrooksKA subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! Happy belated birthday Zangief
[1:52:18] <AngryAsian5> Uncle Sheppy knows what he wants LUL
[1:52:18] <chicken_apostle> PISOL
[1:52:20] <+red_cuppa> whaaaaaaaat
[1:52:22] <butthurtdave> cuz you took yours out
[1:52:22] <%Monkeyweed21> yea my crew was Mordin and Grunt or Tali and Legion
[1:52:22] <Samurai_Tchan> tali face is like MELINA
[1:52:24] <SiameseSneeze> oh yeah, you can't touch dicks with garrus
[1:52:25] <$Ziegsy> to go pee, silly
[1:52:29] <JeysJumbleJams> b/c you shot them?
[1:52:30] <+fetrigon> PATRICK PunOko PunOko PunOko PunOko
[1:52:31] <AluxStreams> I feel like Liara shouldn't know how to use a pistol.
[1:52:32] <Samurai_Tchan> tali looks like BARAKA, UNDERNEAT
[1:52:34] <DatAsuna> Did twitter show you the new tali photo?
[1:52:39] <James_Quivers> Bro, cheating on Liara with Tali and then bringing them both on a certain mission in 3 is amazingly awkward
[1:52:46] <dero45> hell yea
[1:52:49] <butthurtdave> yee liara is straight up multiclass cheating
[1:52:53] <Broken_Sonex> @AluxStreams Shhhhhhh
[1:52:55] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean listen Liara is nice, but she doesn't have that Qurussy we're looking for
[1:52:57] <CrypticMochi> @aluxstreams I mean, i
[1:53:01] <ape_hawk> of COURSE Uncle Shepard is staring at the barely legal aliens all creepy like
[1:53:03] <%Monkeyweed21> but no decryption
[1:53:05] <+D00msDayDan> liara has baby tech too
[1:53:05] <butthurtdave> you still need descriptying
[1:53:06] <+Raspada_Ryner> Maybe if you change their currently equipped weapon they revert to assault rifle?
[1:53:10] <+athuramn> They're also scanning for anything anywhere at any moment
[1:53:11] <Samurai_Tchan> Liara can lean Kitchen business
[1:53:12] <dero45> she cant decrypt
[1:53:14] <+glgzephyr> you don't even use it
[1:53:14] <butthurtdave> nah stasis sucks
[1:53:20] <signofzeta> stasis kicks ass
[1:53:21] <+wvuboii> Stasis sucks in ME1
[1:53:22] <+red_cuppa> i like stasis XD
[1:53:22] <+Pequod1> She reminds me of the ME3 Turian Sentinel
[1:53:23] <tanarath> MIFT
[1:53:25] <%DJFakie> Stasis makes enemies invincible, don't
[1:53:26] <tanarath> LIFT
[1:53:28] <%bread_assassin> Stasis is only good if you go Bastion.
[1:53:28] <%MassConnect> I never use stasis
[1:53:29] <%SataruYamate> IF YOU WERE sENTINEL/bASTION, YOUN WOULD
[1:53:29] <digaogrunge> SING
[1:53:30] <wasdsf> singularity master race
[1:53:30] <omniv_of_g0r> Don't do it
[1:53:30] <BrOOnoh> stasis only good as a sentinel
[1:53:30] <+D00msDayDan> stasis? you mean darkness power?
[1:53:31] <dero45> satsis is better in too
[1:53:32] <peachy996> Does she have Damping?
[1:53:33] <ape_hawk> s i n g u l a r i t y
[1:53:33] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile Nor the hips and ass
[1:53:33] <+glgzephyr> theeeere we go
[1:53:34] <%SataruYamate> woops caps
[1:53:34] <+FelIian> Stasis is amazing as a Sentinel
[1:53:35] <Virokwet> oh hell uea
[1:53:35] <%templar010> YES singularity
[1:53:35] <+red_cuppa> that's the one
[1:53:36] <AluxStreams> Singularity is crazy strong.
[1:53:36] <%Treuan> Yup
[1:53:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Lift is better
[1:53:37] <CrypticMochi> @aluxstreams She would need training if she went out alone
[1:53:38] <penitentpendant> Singularity on the other hand...
[1:53:39] <omniv_of_g0r> Lift for days
[1:53:40] <DatAsuna> @James_Quivers it's almost as awkward as the time I had enough paragon points to save both her people and the geth but then I let the quarians die anyway cause fuck em
[1:53:42] <$RealThiele> s u c c
[1:53:42] <%DJFakie> OK better
[1:53:43] <tanarath> LIFT IS BETTER
[1:53:44] <dero45> hell yea black hole op
[1:53:48] <Samurai_Tchan> Liara learns the history of eletronics
[1:53:48] <butthurtdave> Statis gets better in 3 since you can damage enemies while they're frozen
[1:53:48] <Vantesla> Stasis only good if have the subclass to damage through.
[1:53:49] <digaogrunge> good man
[1:53:50] <Heyestus> He didn't  take lift LUL
[1:53:53] <ape_hawk> remember pat: the best CC is Death
[1:53:57] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt Also when lift gets higher, aim that shit at the floor and watch rooms go bye bye LUL
[1:53:58] <Pookiedaexzile> She only needs Pistol
[1:53:59] <%DJFakie> Stasis is better in later games
[1:53:59] <+glgzephyr> @tanarath But he already has lift
[1:54:03] <omniv_of_g0r> Thank the orb for reminding him
[1:54:06] <+alphonseisbest> Lift id GOD tier on Liara
[1:54:06] <%Maids4lyfe> guess he can't lift
[1:54:07] <+D00msDayDan> hey pat when are you gonna play singularity
[1:54:07] <Minorou> sentinel's got good stasis version
[1:54:16] <buhbuhboat> stasis makes an enemy a non issue for abit not completly useless on higher difficultes
[1:54:22] <dero45> this dat game
[1:54:24] <+glgzephyr> I was about to say LUL
[1:54:25] <ape_hawk> Elite Dangerous?

[1:54:31] <+Afterman_> star citizen Kappa
[1:54:33] <+Bouerd> Spore :)
[1:54:35] <butthurtdave> One of the things I hate about 1 is how all the thingis on a planet arent marked on the map so you still have to explore random corners of the map
[1:54:35] <peachy996> Bo Man's High?
[1:54:35] <+OmegaWeltall> No Man's Sk.... oh nm

[1:55:42] <Alzero83> alzeroYo
[1:55:42] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Atmosphere Not Owned by Humanity...
[1:55:44] <$Wurmspawn> That was me.
[1:55:48] <DatAsuna> since woolie said he's gonna jump right into 2, I anticipate many memory foibles ll
[1:55:48] <dero45> pretty much
[1:55:50] <%Robot_Nixon_> is the fucking cannon hitscan??
[1:55:51] <Samurai_Tchan> WOW ,VAPORIZED
[1:55:58] <s1rcuit> fuck, I'm late
[1:55:58] <%MidnightBurst12> Welcome to modern warfare, nerds

[1:56:03] <+Pequod1> Ladies
[1:56:07] <+glgzephyr> @Robot_Nixon_ Yes
[1:56:09] <DatAsuna> oh this one
[1:56:16] <%StrawberryPantsu> Who?
[1:56:16] <stantheman_97> mako powerful
[1:56:17] <T_Sasquatch> damn
[1:56:18] <%isa_sensei96> Damn!
[1:56:19] <Samurai_Tchan> wow, they gonne
[1:56:20] <DatAsuna> Kasumi comes with the best SMG
[1:56:21] <AluxStreams> That'll be a dope experience then.
[1:56:21] <wasdsf> her loyalty quest is AWESOME
[1:56:22] <Alzero83> Zaeed?
[1:56:22] <%SataruYamate> kasumi is great
[1:56:22] <Heyestus> that's  ok. she sucks
[1:56:22] <$Wurmspawn> Glad to be of service. Was kinda wishing I could've said something while watching the vod.
[1:56:22] <%Robot_Nixon_> @glgzephyr I love that LUL
[1:56:23] <%afronooch> Kasumi rules
[1:56:23] <butthurtdave> Kasumi's cool but not great party-wise
[1:56:25] <%DJFakie> Thoughts on Kasumi
[1:56:26] <tanarath> kasumi is fun
[1:56:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> Kasumi is honestly the best Human romance option.
[1:56:29] <peachy996> Zaeed is fun but he's a pain in the ass to Paragon for
[1:56:29] <andrewofbob> ME weapons are mostly relativistic speeds
[1:56:31] <DatAsuna> but guns in ME2 all kinda suck
[1:56:31] <%demiiluna> Did you ever play with Morinth?
[1:56:32] <dero45> so did you do the shadow broker dlc its fun af
[1:56:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn Katsumi the forgotten DLC child
[1:56:35] <SiameseSneeze> I never got to play the DLC for 2 or 3, so I'm excited to actually experience it
[1:56:36] <+fetrigon> who the fuck is kasumi?
[1:56:37] <%Garthunox> Oh man Kasumi rules
[1:56:38] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man yoy missed a great joke then
[1:56:39] <%isa_sensei96> Missing out on best Thief Girl
[1:56:41] <DatAsuna> I like kasumi but the game never gives her her due
[1:56:41] <Samurai_Tchan> kasumi is always invisible
[1:56:45] <BrOOnoh> what
[1:56:45] <Alzero83> Lair of Shadow Broker is solid
[1:56:46] <stantheman_97> she seems cool but I've never played any ME dlc
[1:56:47] <%Garthunox> She can do Talis stuff in the final mission
[1:56:47] <%DJFakie> Hoo boy, Lair's going to be rad
[1:56:48] <+Pequod1> Is that liara shooting a wall
[1:56:49] <Minorou> just played lair of the shadow broker first time, it's freaking rad
[1:56:49] <%Rumbutt> Oh shit no Shadow Broker
[1:56:50] <Sunstalker> And never Javik?
[1:56:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Shadow Brokers pay off is hilarous
[1:56:51] <+Raspada_Ryner> Lair is fucking great
[1:56:53] <%Garthunox> WOOOAAAAAH
[1:56:54] <aiutare47> I never played ME1 or 2 DLC
[1:56:54] <butthurtdave> I played it for the first time in this collection, it definitely feels like it shoulda been in the base game with how important it is
[1:56:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAAAAAT
[1:56:58] <peachy996> Lair of the Shadow Broker is a great one, the last good DLC to 2
[1:56:59] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Oh man Lair of the Shadow Broker was OK but had some great lore implications
[1:57:00] <T_Sasquatch> @butthurtdave ??????? She's fucking op LUL , literally deletes enemies on a short cooldown
[1:57:01] <Lamokmok> Kasumi is cool. Too bad you don't have a lot of interactions with her.
[1:57:02] <%hax_metatron> It’s a Hitman level
[1:57:03] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Punch guys
[1:57:03] <Broken_Sonex> Kasumi has got a nice ass too, if I recall
[1:57:03] <%Rumbutt> Lair is so fucking good
[1:57:04] <Samurai_Tchan> @fetrigon exactly ,shes very invisible
[1:57:04] <James_Quivers> That DLC is great for digging up dirt on your teammates
[1:57:06] <peachy996> I don't like Arrival very much
[1:57:06] <+JaseAdrift> I heard that you couldnt romance Katsumi and was really sad
[1:57:06] <DatAsuna> Kasumi is like when persona rereleases add a party member
[1:57:08] <%Varlinator> LAIR IS INCREDIBLELY GOOD!
[1:57:12] <DatAsuna> she's cool for her new unique scene
[1:57:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LAIR IS RAD BEST DLC AFTER CITADEL
[1:57:13] <dero45> barrier is pretty much invincibility for a few
[1:57:16] <CrypticMochi> I don’t think I ever saw Kasumi, I did play Shadowbroker though
[1:57:18] <%hax_metatron> Shadow Broker is a Hitman level
[1:57:19] <+Shubreaker> Lair with Vanguard is fantastic
[1:57:19] <+glgzephyr> PHYRE
[1:57:19] <+Afterman_> these nuts
[1:57:20] <+D00msDayDan> the best part of the shadow broker DLC is the fanservice room you unlock at the end where you find grunt's search history and legion getting banned in online shooters for aimbotting
[1:57:21] <DatAsuna> and then she goes right back into the DLC drawer
[1:57:24] <%StrawberryPantsu> OKAY KISUMI MIGHT BE MY NEW FAVORITE ME GIRL!
[1:57:25] <$Wurmspawn> Kinda sucks that ME3 just assumes you do that by revealing that Liara is the Shadow Broker by ME3.
[1:57:25] <DatAsuna> even in the sequel
[1:57:26] <s1rcuit> so what is the propulsion source for ezo weapons again?
[1:57:29] <Samurai_Tchan> @Lamokmok BECAUSE SHES INVISIBLE
[1:57:31] <tinytinykittycat> best ammo
[1:57:32] <aiutare47> 3 though its borderline necessary to play the DLC, you miss a ton if you dont
[1:57:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't forget to change it back
[1:57:39] <peachy996> Whatever your opinion on Kasumi is you can't deny her mission was fun
[1:57:44] <iosephe> wholesome damage
[1:57:49] <chicken_apostle> crime :)
[1:57:51] <FutaSnek> MORE LIKE CRIME DEAD
[1:57:54] <+Pequod1> get fucked
[1:57:58] <Jokobeast> STOP DOING CRIMES
[1:58:00] <KeystoneA2> LotSB should've been the mission everyone gets in the shuttle for when the Normandy gets attacked. Would've made sense you bring your entire crew to bring down the Broker.
[1:58:03] <butthurtdave> that's how mafia works
[1:58:03] <dero45> if only his parents named him steven
[1:58:03] <+Shubreaker> there's a certain bossfight on vanguard which is straight up the most fun you will have with this series
[1:58:03] <James_Quivers> CRIME HAS BEEN ENDED
[1:58:03] <s1rcuit> I know the ezo guns affect the mass of the ammunition, but what actually propels the ammo forward?
[1:58:04] <DatAsuna> @Wurmspawn No? If you don't do the DLC or start a new save it becomes a running joke that she's badly trying to hide it from you
[1:58:07] <signofzeta> jesus pistols kick ass
[1:58:08] <FutaSnek> STOP BEING ILLEGAL
[1:58:10] <TourettesPlays> If I was that much of a bullet sponge I bet I could be a crime boss...
[1:58:11] <AluxStreams> Man I love when you just ragdoll the level boss across the floor. lol
[1:58:12] <+glgzephyr> god the speed of that prompt is so goofy
[1:58:14] <Gorshum> That dude's super defeated.
[1:58:14] <%hax_metatron> CRIME BOSS LUL
[1:58:15] <%DianaTheAscian> CRIME DEFEATED
[1:58:18] <Minorou> why do so many npcs think the shadow broker is a group of people because the broker handles a lot and not think it's, like, an AI
[1:58:18] <Pookiedaexzile> My opinion on Katsumi is that I wish she and Zaheed were switched so I could have more time wit hher
[1:58:19] <Jokobeast> SHOOT ALL THE CRIMES
[1:58:20] <Samurai_Tchan> Liara is your stand
[1:58:23] <tanarath> CRIME SOLVE THROUGH SELF DEFENSE
[1:58:25] <andrewofbob> Probably magnets
[1:58:27] <+D00msDayDan> criminal slain
[1:58:27] <%AncelDeLambert> *kills a random guy* "Mission Complete!"

[1:58:47] <Jokobeast> LUL
[1:58:48] <%AzureGale> FUS RO DAH
[1:58:48] <butthurtdave> no you shoot the gun and it goes ANTHEM
[1:58:49] <+glgzephyr> STOP THIEF
[1:58:51] <1matheuw> stop right there crimninal scum
[1:58:51] <%MassConnect> To each their own; I found Kasumi to be the most powerful character
[1:58:56] <Heyestus> YOUR STOLEN GOODS ARE FORFEIT
[1:58:56] <+wmeldrum> STOP-STOP-STOP-STOPRIGHT
[1:58:57] <Samurai_Tchan> CRIMINAL scum
[1:59:02] <%DJFakie> Hand Cannon mod from Dead Space 2?
[1:59:05] <NBD_Rab> Stop resisting!
[1:59:07] <+Pequod1> Katana V
[1:59:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite Gate in Oblivion
[1:59:09] <ape_hawk> hey pat, did you notice that the colors of Paragon and Renegade are the same as police colors?
[1:59:10] <1matheuw> NOW! YOU! DIE!
[1:59:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Stop Right- Stop Ri- Stop Ri- Stop Ri-
[1:59:10] <TourettesPlays> Pls no, Leroy Jenkins is distracting enough
[1:59:13] <stantheman_97> THEN PAY WITH YOUR BLOOD
[1:59:14] <%strakillias> STOP, You've violated the law
[1:59:16] <%Robot_Nixon_> I want shepards hurt sound replaced with a roblox OOF
[1:59:18] <redapache> Or the Taco Bell sound as a hitsound
[1:59:20] <Samurai_Tchan> STOP ,YOU VIOLATED THE LAW
[1:59:22] <%demiiluna> I think I failed the decryption minigame once in my entire time playing ME
[1:59:23] <Profmcstevie> YOU'VE VIOLATED THE LAW you filthy attractive alien thing
[1:59:27] <%Dr_DangerPhD> I've fought mudcrabs more fearsome than you
[1:59:28] <peachy996> I liked Kasumi and Zaeed just fine.  I didn't really hate anyone in 12 man lineup of 2
[1:59:31] <butthurtdave> I think the Spectra guns cost about 300K
[1:59:33] <ChungusQuest> It's time to kick ass and deck Khalisah al-Jilani
[1:59:33] <+Pequod1> PAY THE FINE
[1:59:34] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[1:59:37] <peachy996> Even Jacob was...okay
[1:59:37] <%dekkitout> Right
[1:59:38] <FutaSnek> ITS TRASH IN THE BEST WAY
[1:59:41] <%AncelDeLambert> it's good but MY GOD is it bad
[1:59:43] <thelonechris> The Normandy should get a siren like from the Naked Gun intros
[1:59:43] <zenith0111> Wiil you ever play Mass Effect 3 again?
[1:59:44] <Jokobeast> Yeah, I understand that. LUL
[1:59:47] <$Wurmspawn> @Wurmspawn I didn't get that my first playthrough. I couldn't afford that DLC when I first transferred me ME2 save to ME3 and I got to where Liara just casually mentions being the Shadow Broker and I was like, "excuse me, WHAT?!"
[1:59:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> I much prefer "HALT HALT HALT HALT..." from Daggerfall
[1:59:48] <James_Quivers> Oblivion is the height of so bad it's good
[1:59:48] <%dekkitout> THE SEQUEL
[1:59:49] <peachy996> Didn't exactly hate him
[1:59:50] <buhbuhboat> Sucks that Kasumi and Zaeed don't get full conversations on the normandy
[1:59:51] <ioci2112> it means japanese sword
[1:59:52] <%AncelDeLambert> THAT'S ONE WHOLE NUMBER MORE!
[1:59:52] <alroy900> its the best trash
[1:59:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh shit and you didn't have to pay a scalper
[1:59:54] <dero45> dtchatBlindFuryCop
[1:59:54] <+sermittens> oblivion might be the best elder scrolls
[1:59:54] <dirtyh4rr1> it's the best trrash

[1:59:56] <%DJFakie> BIG KATANA

[2:00:07] <+D00msDayDan> number go big
[2:00:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Number go up
[2:00:08] <Samurai_Tchan> i would preffer if he says that only when combat begins
[2:00:09] <fritz_dacat> I prefer Samaxe myself
[2:00:09] <Jokobeast> BIG NUMBER = BIG GOOD
[2:00:12] <%DianaTheAscian> NUMBER GO UP
[2:00:13] <%JamesCorck> Number go psaBig
[2:00:16] <Minorou> oh man, just wait until Katana VI
[2:00:18] <stantheman_97> I LOVE KAY-TANAS
[2:00:20] <AluxStreams> Katana 5: Guardians.
[2:00:26] <+glgzephyr> yeah it is, but galactic microchip shortages really messed with the production of the Katana V so almost nobody can buy one @PatStaresAt
[2:00:31] <Vantesla> Tungsten good for Geth/ai missions
[2:00:32] <Wolfstriker121> i agree
[2:00:32] <peachy996> It's a real Hattori Hanzo Gun
[2:00:34] <DatAsuna> speaking of Vs One good thing about ME3 MP lootboxes was when you upgraded the gun, it removed it from the loot pool. So there was no infinite dupes like every other game.
[2:00:35] <FutaSnek> Perhaps LUL
[2:00:40] <+Pequod1> Faster is better
[2:00:43] <tanarath> YEP
[2:00:52] <Heyestus> How many planets have you completed pat? @patstaresat
[2:00:52] <Pookiedaexzile> You mean playing a shooter with better gear feels better?
[2:00:54] <frostyjay3> Is he on Ferros now????
[2:00:55] <%AncelDeLambert> certainly makes the game shorter, and since there's three of them, that's good
[2:00:56] <%Arkfyre> I just finished a playthrough on insanity and it's much better yeah
[2:01:01] <butthurtdave> If you sold all your excess inventory you could probably afford a Spectre gun
[2:01:03] <CrypticMochi> I think I remember seeing that ammo that go up to rank 7 go higher now
[2:01:03] <Samurai_Tchan> "you broke the law IN MY WATCH !" psaGoblin
[2:01:03] <tanarath> BIG NUMBER GO UP QUICKER
[2:01:06] <%Monkeyweed21> no one played ME1 for the gameplay
[2:01:16] <1matheuw> lol
[2:01:18] <%AncelDeLambert> @Monkeyweed21 exactly
[2:01:23] <AmuserName> I imagine you'll be even MORE starved for better upgrades late-game than in the original.
[2:01:25] <AluxStreams> Therum is like Pluto.
[2:01:28] <James_Quivers> You're gonna have Spectre weapons going into Virmire
[2:01:34] <Vantesla> They added VII-X mods for guns prior not available. Tungsten for example didn't have an X version in original.
[2:01:35] <Wolfstriker121> blue booba
[2:01:36] <Pookiedaexzile> We all thought we would
[2:01:38] <%AncelDeLambert> ....
[2:01:38] <$Wurmspawn> Pat!
[2:01:40] <TourettesPlays> Has Pat experienced any glitches so far?
[2:01:41] <peachy996> @DatAsuna Yeah Andromeda has like Siphon Bulwark and Concussive versions that only add to the bloated rng
[2:01:43] <1matheuw> by the nine! a murderer is on the loose!
[2:01:44] <thelonechris> When did the Mako turn blue?
[2:01:44] <s1rcuit> Mr.StaresAt I have an ME lore question: What is do ME guns use to propel the shots forward? I know ezo affects the mass, but what actually propels it forward?
[2:01:45] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> ...could you elaborate on that Pat?
[2:01:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Blue Razz on ya dick
[2:01:46] <butthurtdave> i usually beat ME1 with a male and fem shep and then never touch it again
[2:01:48] <+senfood> PATRICK
[2:01:48] <%DakotaMacDoodle> no
[2:01:49] <%MidnightBurst12> Hell yeah

[2:01:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Blue Razz Ass
[2:01:55] <Vantesla> I meant new as others already could go to X
[2:01:56] <igatso> It looks like them only made half Done game
[2:01:58] <dero45> bloody and mangled
[2:02:01] <Wolfstriker121> REPEAT TTHAT PAT
[2:02:02] <AmuserName> SCHLOP SCHLOP SHLORP SCHLOP
[2:02:04] <+StoopKid241> why?
[2:02:06] <%LouieRouie> Look, sir, droids
[2:02:08] <Heyestus> Gear looting scaled with your character's  level in the original game. if you're  high level you will get stronger gear outside of shops @patstaresat
[2:02:12] <%RoggleJr> Blue raspberry, delicious.
[2:02:12] <Broken_Sonex> RIGHT YOU ARE UNCLE SHEPARD
[2:02:13] <frostyjay3> God damn Pat
[2:02:16] <%watts121> watts121 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Damn Pat's got that ME fever.
[2:02:17] <peanutdot007> But was it a dextro slurpy?
[2:02:17] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 And worse, andromeda doesn't let me cheat engine myself infintie MP currency lol
[2:02:19] <hat_under_bread> Man. Half the reason the Mako felt so bad was this planet design. It's so bumpy for no reason.
[2:02:22] <+senfood> @Pookiedaexzile Blueberry Booty
[2:02:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Sir this is a space Wendys

[2:02:34] <AluxStreams> What's a better ATV? The Mako or the Skyrim Horse?
[2:02:34] <buhbuhboat> Its pretty easy to trivialise ME1 even on insanity, especially if you play soldier and have crazy high damage protection
[2:02:36] <James_Quivers> HACK THE CORPSE
[2:02:39] <peanutdot007> Hack that corpse
[2:02:45] <butthurtdave> Tali best girl, but I hate romancing her because I'm blueballing Garrus as a result
[2:02:52] <%DJFakie> Less sense than Simon Says of 360 era?
[2:02:53] <%RonaldMcDownload> next Death Battle: Mako vs. Skyrim horse
[2:02:56] <iosephe> HACK THE PLANET, wait I mean CORPSE
[2:02:57] <chicken_apostle> man, mass effect 1 is rough
[2:03:04] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[2:03:04] <%ssjklyco> That;s a stupid reason
[2:03:07] <%dankjerri> oh now its snowy tank fun
[2:03:10] <penitentpendant> He has more time for Calibrations
[2:03:10] <%Mekhet09> Garrus and tali don't have a thing.
[2:03:12] <ape_hawk> garrus' balls are already blue
[2:03:15] <%Mekhet09> I've never seen that.
[2:03:15] <peachy996> @DatAsuna I grinded years to get my stupid Piranha shotgun and its still not fully upgraded lmao. In 3 it was much easier
[2:03:15] <ape_hawk> cuz hes a cop
[2:03:16] <+Romuken> I'm sure Garrus likes that though.  #CuckGarrus
[2:03:17] <aiutare47> My alien waifu, Garrus can find his own
[2:03:20] <James_Quivers> @butthurtdave Garrus works best as a lone wolf badass anyway tho
[2:03:20] <%watts121> She can eat his...calibrations
[2:03:21] <+alphonseisbest> WUT?
[2:03:22] <+Shubreaker> @butthurtdave she's not garrus's girl
[2:03:24] <%dankjerri> garrus should fuck the SHIP
[2:03:24] <%watts121> unlike femshep
[2:03:26] <%DJFakie> He had three years to make a move, technically
[2:03:27] <wasdsf> garrus is powered by frustration
[2:03:27] <Vantesla> @buhbuhboat Can't be immortal via infinite Immunity in remaster like in original. Though not a big deal at all LUL
[2:03:28] <Dunmarkh> cops always have blue balls
[2:03:28] <$Wurmspawn> Calibrate THIS gun!
[2:03:29] <%Mekhet09> I've litterally never seen them get together.
[2:03:30] <geassguy360> yeah they do if you dont romance either of them
[2:03:30] <hat_under_bread> He can bang girls on shore leave.
[2:03:31] <%afronooch> GO calibrate some bitches garrus
[2:03:31] <Meekest> His balls are gonna be as blue as he is
[2:03:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Garrus will live
[2:03:32] <%Scottigecko> never feel bad about cucking fascists
[2:03:35] <Samurai_Tchan> NO, YOU DONT DIE WITH LIARA !!!
[2:03:35] <butthurtdave> They fool around on the Normandy if you dont romance either
[2:03:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Treating Garrus like a bitch is cannon
[2:03:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Garrus supports you if you go for her first
[2:03:40] <dero45> garrus got bitches
[2:03:42] <%Mekhet09> Where did this garrus and tali thing start?
[2:03:43] <geassguy360> this is why i romance liara. the game wants you to anyways
[2:03:44] <Pookiedaexzile> You're his sempai
[2:03:44] <peanutdot007> @dankjerri Joker is fucking the ship already
[2:03:44] <+Romuken> c'mon guys, spread it.  #CuckGarrus
[2:03:47] <Sunstalker> I mean, he could go for Liara
[2:03:47] <1matheuw> just bang him as weel PROBLEM SOLVED
[2:03:48] <Heyestus> @mekhet09 they get together in 3 if you don't  romance either of them
[2:03:50] <aiutare47> TWO YEARS
[2:03:51] <Samurai_Tchan> its only with that justicar that you can die
[2:03:52] <Wolfstriker121> lore wise tali cant survive without her suit ....unless i forgot something idk  its been awhile
[2:03:53] <+Shubreaker> i can and will cuck a cop
[2:03:56] <andrewofbob> @Mekhet09 You can catch them snuggling towards the end of 3 of they're both free
[2:03:56] <AluxStreams> Garrus was busy being Batman.
[2:03:57] <%barrakuta371> @dankjerri No that's Joker's job
[2:03:58] <%watts121> He was too busy being Space Punisher.
[2:03:58] <ape_hawk> #CuckGarrus
[2:03:58] <+senfood> And instead he decided to become Space Batman.
[2:03:59] <peachy996> Wish I could romance Garrus instead of Tali or Femshep
[2:03:59] <%Mekhet09> I didn't know that.
[2:03:59] <+MightyDuckShoes> Harris doesn't get cucked. he only starts a relationship with Tali after you've decided not to pursue
[2:04:01] <ChungusQuest> Suuuuuure, blame the plateless monkeys for deadly Turian dick rash
[2:04:03] <filialpails> cucking cops is a public service
[2:04:04] <viewtifulr> calibrate my guns Garres I need to kill some Qussy
[2:04:08] <TourettesPlays> Tali sees you as a father figure, sleeping with her is objectively wrong
[2:04:10] <+Romuken> #CuckGarrus
[2:04:12] <%emperordread> it's your obligation to fuck a cop's wife
[2:04:12] <+senfood> Sorry, Space Punisher.
[2:04:12] <RaidenRising> but space batman
[2:04:13] <$Wurmspawn> It takes the end of the universe for Garrus to start thinking about makin babies.
[2:04:14] <+MightyDuckShoes> alternate timelines don't count
[2:04:19] <$Mekhet09> You can just bone garrus pat.
[2:04:19] <%dankjerri> joker x garrus x normandy
[2:04:20] <peachy996> the pain of not bromancing your raptor brot
[2:04:21] <Samurai_Tchan> theres jack
[2:04:24] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Garrus is super cool with it if you bang Tali first
[2:04:26] <%hrbeck_> HUMAN HOUSE RULES!
[2:04:27] <Broken_Sonex> @TourettesPlays BUT THAT ASS THO
[2:04:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Garrus needs to introduce Ashley to a website called Turian'***
[2:04:42] <%MidnightBurst12> Went off to be the Punisher on some crime planet instead
[2:04:44] <TourettesPlays> @TourettesPlays She's like 17
[2:04:50] <1matheuw> fk this bitch ass planete and everyone in it
[2:04:50] <%watts121> Garrus needs to introduce Ashley to an airlock.
[2:04:51] <Pokerherz> seq2
[2:04:51] <+Romuken> I'm sure Garrus likes that though.  #CuckGarrus
[2:04:53] <%dankjerri> garrus x ashley
[2:04:54] <James_Quivers> @TourettesPlays Wut, she straight up says she falls in love with you after 1 even if you don't persue a relationship
[2:05:02] <peachy996> Gemini Ligma?
[2:05:05] <butthurtdave> Remember to save Ashley in ME1 so you can have Garrus kill her in ME3
[2:05:07] <wasdsf> it never comes up if you romance heer
[2:05:09] <Wolfstriker121> he would watch
[2:05:13] <%watts121> Garrus is cool regardless even if you cheat on Tali.
[2:05:18] <Broken_Sonex> @TourettesPlays Eh just wait two years Kappa
[2:05:22] <Pokerherz> Ligma diek
[2:05:26] <arkv01> as blood drips out of his clenched fists
[2:05:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> @midnightburst12 Yeah when he should have been punishing that ass
[2:05:32] <+senfood> LUL
[2:05:34] <%strakillias> If you have different lovers in ME and ME2 it may come up in 3 as well
[2:05:34] <%dankjerri> PAT CEASE

[2:05:55] <%dankjerri> YOU ARE HEREBY FORBIDDEN
[2:05:56] <Dfreddy8> Where do yout party members sleep?
[2:05:58] <Profmcstevie> It appears we must search the Ligma Nexus Garrus "Ligma what" LIGMA BALLS
[2:06:01] <%watts121> Wait if you romance nobody in ME1 does that mean Shepard was grooming her until she was legal in ME2?
[2:06:03] <+Shubreaker> garrus never shows interest in Tali until like 60% through ME3
[2:06:08] <viewtifulr> SIGMA?! your back form the dead?
[2:06:11] <+Fooguwu> I might be in love with Tali it's a problem
[2:06:13] <peanutdot007> Han system more like Han-dle deez nutz
[2:06:16] <James_Quivers> Tali is LITERALLY WILLING TO RISK SPACE AIDS to bang you, how are you NOT gonna go for it
[2:06:17] <%dekkitout> Harems do that to ya
[2:06:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Because In Mass Effect you fuck
[2:06:21] <AluxStreams> Because the game has dialog options I guess?
[2:06:21] <butthurtdave> like the DQ11 "slam her pregnant until she cries"
[2:06:25] <arkv01> because social links are for scumbags
[2:06:26] <Thepothero> That’s what I did I didn’t like liara or spaciest ashley
[2:06:26] <%dankjerri> you should play fuckin Arcanum
[2:06:33] <%SvenHolgersson> PATS THAT ONE KID WHO STOLE HIS GRANDMAS CAR
[2:06:38] <Heyestus> that's why bad things happe
[2:06:42] <%dekkitout> @butthurtdave psaCrazyhand
[2:06:43] <%JamesCorck> It's not you, Pat. It's your character.
[2:06:44] <Wolfstriker121> tali is a a quiet one AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY about the quiet ones
[2:06:45] <stantheman_97> morality is just a word
[2:06:46] <seniormeatbox> tali os best fuck her in 2 and 3
[2:06:48] <%shadowace2400> !uptime
[2:06:48] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 7m.
[2:06:49] <+Shubreaker> it IS fun
[2:06:49] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt Pat this is just space persona
[2:06:50] <Broken_Sonex> Good ol Uncle Shepard
[2:06:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Shepard: I just wanna do Hood rat things with my friends
[2:06:55] <peachy996> Squid
[2:07:03] <Profmcstevie> An emphasis on being your own person allows you to embrace the shitstain half of your soul
[2:07:03] <%emperordread> In a game of galactic apocalypse, I found it refreshing to tell Problem People to yeet themselves from existence
[2:07:10] <%DakotaMacDoodle> What you doing?, you're doing some cool ass shit is what!
[2:07:15] <%dankjerri> why are there no personas in space
[2:07:32] <%dekkitout> @Pookiedaexzile Ignant shit like that is what I play rpg's for
[2:07:36] <%SkyfireHero> remember to get the Colossus armor for everyone
[2:07:37] <%DJFakie> Are loyalty missions just doing 1-10 social links in one mission
[2:07:37] <RaidenRising> is this endwalker?
[2:07:40] <geassguy360> Barrier is op lol just pop that on with explosive/sledgehammer rounds, run around and kill everything, no cover needed.
[2:07:41] <%hrbeck_> Shepard getting everyone on the show preggers and being dragged onto intergalactic Maury
[2:07:46] <peachy996> You can do it Mako!
[2:07:54] <peachy996> Climb that shit
[2:07:57] <%watts121> God I forgot how cursed this Mako shit was in ME1.
[2:07:59] <ape_hawk> im just imagining shepard telling everyone to get out of the mako and ordering them to take out their guns
[2:08:02] <butthurtdave> gotta go at diagonals
[2:08:09] <Dfreddy8> OH NO
[2:08:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Asari Maury Rhymes and would be the best show on Space TV
[2:08:24] <%emperordread> Wait the Mako has a boost besides the jump? I missed so much playing through this lol
[2:08:28] <Heyestus> they turn into FAT STACKS once you're  done collecting
[2:08:30] <geassguy360> some of these planets are straight up infuriating
[2:08:30] <peachy996> I never bothered with the Minerals in 1
[2:08:31] <AmuserName> Those Ores are a big XP farm.
[2:08:32] <+Fooguwu> why is Tali NWS art always so tasteless or bad
[2:08:32] <butthurtdave> YEAH THE MASS EFFECT 1 EXPERIENCE
[2:08:34] <Sunstalker> Look at this skyrim horse
[2:08:34] <AluxStreams> They also put them close to or along the way to marked locations.
[2:08:34] <+glgzephyr> it's almost like you're not supposed to  get everything LUL
[2:08:34] <penitentpendant> It kind of feels like that thing in Resident Evil, where they put ammo everywhere and assumed you wouldn't find all of it
[2:08:35] <TourettesPlays> The Asari Writings come back in ME3 in a really surprising and kind of complicated way
[2:08:39] <%dekkitout> When we mako launching
[2:08:39] <%SataruYamate> do those fetch quests have any impact on me 3 readiness, or is it just me 1 completion
[2:08:40] <Vantesla> @hrbeck_ He did it off screen inn3. That is why he was cool with the end LUL
[2:08:41] <%DJFakie> @emperordread It didn't used to
[2:08:43] <buhbuhboat> Mountainous uncharted planets NotLikeThis
[2:08:44] <Pookiedaexzile> "After doing 3 mind scans we have found you are....NOT THE SPACE FATHER"

[2:08:56] <geassguy360> hmmmmmmm
[2:08:56] <stormhawk9891> But he's in da box
[2:08:56] <%watts121> Salarian corpses turn into boxes.
[2:08:57] <iosephe> are you sure
[2:09:00] <%dekkitout> Totally is, the organs are inside
[2:09:02] <%derpy_platypus> HMMM
[2:09:03] <Pookiedaexzile> It could fit in that box
[2:09:03] <%LouieRouie> It's inside
[2:09:03] <andrewofbob> It's a sarcophagus, Pat
[2:09:06] <%Rumbutt> HACK THAT MUMMY
[2:09:06] <tanarath> It's his box
[2:09:07] <BrinstarGardeningSociety> Decode the mummy with your electronics
[2:09:10] <dirtyh4rr1> how do you know?
[2:09:10] <%StaceMcGate> When Salarians mummify, they turn into crates Pat. Its science.
[2:09:11] <%emperordread> @DJFakie Ok, I was just doing the "OG experience" if anyone asks LUL
[2:09:12] <RaidenRising> are you sure about that?
[2:09:12] <+D00msDayDan> maybe it's a sarcophagus
[2:09:13] <%MidnightBurst12> You didn't open it tho
[2:09:14] <ape_hawk> its probably a kid salarian
[2:09:19] <TourettesPlays> Mummified Salarian is probably like crocodile jerky, probably tastes good
[2:09:21] <%MassConnect> big mummy milkers?
[2:09:21] <%watts121> They are a Prothean delicacy, and come with their own Bento Box.
[2:09:24] <buhbuhboat> oh yeah you get rich fast in ME1
[2:09:28] <AmuserName> SALARIAN IN 2 COFFINS, PAT

[2:09:48] <morningmoondude> mr feel sends me here and ur literally digging up shit
[2:09:48] <Minorou> the Mako wasn't the problem, it's the planets

[2:10:10] <%dankjerri> oh so,you actually cant pronounce things
[2:10:10] <SSPS87> the Malo is actually not that bad, it's the level design that made it bad
[2:10:13] <Lamokmok> It handles like shit. I love it.
[2:10:18] <DiaDiaDiamond> Mass effect 4 will be good mr.feel swears
[2:10:21] <%MidnightBurst12> Words r hard
[2:10:27] <%Monkeyweed21> the problem isnt the mako its the empty mountains you drive through
[2:10:27] <%watts121> So what's gonna happen to Bioware if the ME Legacy edition sells more than Dragon Age 4?
[2:10:29] <$dalmek> I already forgot everything about that Mr Feel tweet except "blussy"

[2:10:48] <wasdsf> no just bring back shepard AGAIN
[2:10:51] <Dfreddy8> No just 3 Asari
[2:10:51] <%DianaTheAscian> probably
[2:10:53] <%bread_assassin> I hope ME4 lets us be a nonhuman.
[2:10:55] <stantheman_97> or just asari
[2:10:57] <%dekkitout> Wanna share the blue slushy comment, son?
[2:11:00] <%StaceMcGate> Can Humans even produce children with Quarian and Turians?
[2:11:01] <arkv01> shepard won't let his kids get their vaccinations
[2:11:11] <+Shubreaker> god imagine playing a human-alien hybrid
[2:11:11] <peanutdot007> Creepy Uncle Response
[2:11:13] <Minorou> oh man, mass effect fanfiction stream when
[2:11:13] <ape_hawk> what if you had kids with tali and the kids come out as those ones from kermit and piggy, all deformed and shit
[2:11:15] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[2:11:15] <ioci2112> people have to learn to appreciate, love and embrace the jank, then you will be finally free
[2:11:16] <Pookiedaexzile> THe Ichiban response
[2:11:19] <zenith0111> SeemsGood
[2:11:22] <Profmcstevie> "Ew gross no"
[2:11:24] <%watts121> Even if you don't romance Liara...you kinda romance Liara.
[2:11:24] <%Agami23> what, like your character goes "splooge in my zoo"
[2:11:24] <+D00msDayDan> and then the uncle pat response
[2:11:24] <BigNerdSam> Don't forget the ultimate response: "..."
[2:11:26] <+glgzephyr> incest baby!?
[2:11:26] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt So disco elysium?
[2:11:27] <%DianaTheAscian> THE PAT RESPONSE
[2:11:28] <AluxStreams> These games could do with a third "dumbass" path.
[2:11:29] <Psyramics> @StaceMcGate no, their cum is toxic
[2:11:31] <%Raikouija> Maybe the chromosomes prevent that from happening
[2:11:32] <%demiiluna> I thought Pat's response would be like "Quote Skeet Fighter"
[2:11:39] <+StoopKid241> LUL wtf
[2:11:42] <Chaos_Aether> PAt
[2:11:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat It'd be cool if you could play as Shepards child and picking his race determined who Shepards partner was
[2:11:45] <DatAsuna> her dad is into it tho
[2:11:45] <AmuserName> SHEPARD, PUT YOUR AMINO GOOF JUICE IN MY DEXTRO BAGOONER - TALI
[2:11:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> How romantic
[2:11:46] <stantheman_97> "i love incest tho"
[2:11:47] <arkv01> strong game, uncle shep
[2:11:48] <butthurtdave> Is that what you said to win Peach?
[2:11:51] <Broken_Sonex> You're right Uncle Shepard
[2:11:52] <+D00msDayDan> oh my god pat
[2:11:52] <%dekkitout> "Where I'm from Liara, it's called 'Wincest'."
[2:11:53] <peachy996> Do not Goo in the Blue
[2:11:54] <%isa_sensei96> @BigNerdSam I just thought that
[2:12:00] <%ssjklyco> Mass Effect remade as a JRPG
[2:12:00] <morningmoondude> i forgot about the frogger minigame
[2:12:01] <%StaceMcGate> Do Asari need our goo or do they just extract genetic data from touching?
[2:12:01] <aiutare47> @StaceMcGate I doubt they are compatible, they have different biochemistry, it'd be like acid to them
[2:12:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Shepard: Play Virtrua Fighter
[2:12:07] <ChungusQuest> Yes, No, [Lie] Yes, and [Lie] I'm not a scumbag!
[2:12:12] <morningmoondude> Plus him and Paige are incest
[2:12:13] <ape_hawk> like "yo paige, my dick wont fit"
[2:12:14] <%SvenHolgersson> "Hey baby you want fuck" Pat probably
[2:12:17] <%dankjerri> pats gonna get jizzum in his mailbox
[2:12:18] <arkv01> then you propositioned depositing your goo in her
[2:12:23] <aiutare47> @StaceMcGate no genetic data is exchanged at all, its all memories
[2:12:23] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:12:24] <Pookiedaexzile> So to win Paige Pat shat his pants
[2:12:26] <%demiiluna> I always picture Pat saying the lines from Skeet Fighter during the sex. Is that just me
[2:12:27] <AluxStreams> "Miranda I won't do fuck unless you maxed Futaba's S-Link."

[2:16:49] <aiutare47> clip it
[2:16:50] <%SvenHolgersson> It was the only option
[2:16:51] <$personmanthingg> mrfeel has gone vanguard as well
[2:16:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Gets better when you can jump accross the map
[2:16:53] <%watts121> For all we know these guys were just chilling and only shot cuz they thought Shepard was a pirate.
[2:16:54] <%JamesCorck> 8D

[2:16:55] <%AncelDeLambert> haha, now YOU are the cringe
[2:16:57] <%JamesCorck> Aw fuck yesh.
[2:16:59] <aiutare47> clip it and never let him forget it
[2:16:59] <Gorshum> SeemsGood
[2:16:59] <srv4254> in 3 its insane
[2:17:00] <penitentpendant> We're not always right, but sometimes we are
[2:17:01] <Psyramics> Vanguard was fun in the original, just pop barrier and run at dudes
[2:17:05] <%JamesCorck> Vanguard fucking rocks.
[2:17:07] <geassguy360> Vanguard is sooooo fucking good in 2 and 3
[2:17:10] <%watts121> this game is basically a series of no-knock raids.
[2:17:12] <peachy996> 3 Vanguard has Nova right?
[2:17:13] <%truexst0rm> You should go Infiltrator in 2
[2:17:14] <%JamesCorck> Soldier is a pretty safe choice.
[2:17:16] <dirtyh4rr1> vanguard gets better and better
[2:17:17] <Them00n> mrfeel is playing vanguard in 3 and is just folding everything in sight.
[2:17:18] <%JamesCorck> But Vanguard rocks.
[2:17:18] <Dfreddy8> You can switch classes per game anyway
[2:17:19] <tinytinykittycat> You get that dash move in 2
[2:17:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Barrier was the og biotic jump
[2:17:24] <butthurtdave> the game will let you change classes between games in case you see some other class you like
[2:17:28] <%SvenHolgersson> Vanguard is great cuz you just rush dudes and shotgun em in the face
[2:17:28] <mak0t0yukii> What does vanguard do?
[2:17:31] <TourettesPlays> YEAAA The Prodigy amps are the best in the game
[2:17:32] <%dankjerri> if i can get this to,run on my comp, im gonna run the guns and tech guy
[2:17:34] <%MassConnect> that's a good band
[2:17:34] <%watts121> Infiltrator is IMO the best class.
[2:17:35] <%dekkitout> Beeg
[2:17:35] <%truexst0rm> Widow FTW
[2:17:38] <TheApeGatsby> Vanguard was unplayably trash in 2 on higher difficulties, thank god they buffed them in that game
[2:17:42] <%SvenHolgersson> Vanguard is magic and guns
[2:17:42] <%StaceMcGate> BUT POWER GO DOWN
[2:17:43] <AmuserName> ARMALI COUNCIL NUMBA ONEEEE
[2:17:45] <tanarath> big duration & cd
[2:17:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Vangaurd get close and fucks shit up
[2:17:49] <+Shubreaker> FIRESTARTER
[2:17:49] <geassguy360> yeah 3 has charge that restores all barriers, nova, and the weight system that can make cooldowns riddic
[2:17:50] <mikesumusprime> Wait, Kaidan is from Vancouver? No wonder Pat hates him.
[2:17:57] <Pookiedaexzile> I played thru hard in ME2 as Vanguard
[2:17:57] <%SvenHolgersson> Instead of max gun or max magic
[2:18:03] <morningmoondude> in 3 Vanguard is Super Saiyan
[2:18:13] <ScreamLord> Mantis, Scorpion, Ursa, Titan, and Colossus are the only armor sets worth anything
[2:18:13] <thelonechris> The fuck
[2:18:13] <Psyramics> warp is more valuable for the debuff, iirc
[2:18:18] <+Pequod1> utility magic ftw
[2:18:24] <butthurtdave> Quarian armor is so rare in this game
[2:18:26] <Ranger747> nice
[2:18:29] <Dfreddy8> Charge x Nova
[2:18:30] <TourettesPlays> Warp is the least useful biotic in 1 and the most useful in 2
[2:18:31] <%watts121> Yeah in 3 Vanguard might be the most powerful class if you have a low cooldown build.
[2:18:32] <%SvenHolgersson> Phoenix for the TRASH
[2:18:32] <aiutare47> and it looks bad too
[2:18:35] <Vantesla> Vanguard set up for Nemesis and picking Singularity as a bonus power. Is pretty much a slightly better DPS/defensive Adept. Mind Adept still better in using constant abilities.
[2:18:37] <butthurtdave> Isn't Phoenix the pink power ranger armor
[2:18:38] <peachy996> Pink and White time

[2:20:05] <%SirGO0SE> :)
[2:20:05] <%SvenHolgersson> Anytime boo
[2:20:13] <%templar010> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:20:13] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:20:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you missed a box in the last room
[2:20:17] <%AzureGale> WHATS IN THE BOOOOOOOOOOOX
[2:20:20] <%StaceMcGate> Feros was the weakest of the planets to me, especially since the boss had 0 music at all
[2:20:21] <rekinom> No box left behind
[2:20:22] <%AncelDeLambert> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:20:28] <cherrycottontail> iu would say this remaster looks pretty much the same
[2:20:30] <%watts121> Shepard has asthma.
[2:20:30] <KaitlynnHere> Oh no!
[2:20:33] <$renegade_blade> I was lucky and got colossus armor for tali from morlan's shop on the citadel, when I was around this point of my current playthrough
[2:20:35] <%MassConnect> I bet it's more phoneix
[2:20:36] <%DJFakie> Fat Boy Wednesdays, just like Woolie streams
[2:20:38] <KaitlynnHere> Not one guy!M
[2:20:38] <%Robot_Nixon_> nah Jebaited
[2:20:43] <TourettesPlays> @dedeec its nice that its finally all in one package but they improved basically nothing
[2:20:43] <%AncelDeLambert> oh shit he did
[2:20:44] <penitentpendant> GJ Monkeyweed
[2:20:46] <butthurtdave> How bad are the mind goblins going to be in ME2 with the planet scanning?
[2:20:46] <aiutare47> but the boss is ultra cool
[2:20:48] <%AncelDeLambert> gobolins satiated
[2:20:49] <+TheMadeMember> Hey Pat, it's 2am here in the U and the K
[2:20:49] <%psidefx> One Box
[2:20:50] <peachy996> I think Feros is one of the best
[2:20:54] <%isa_sensei96> Fr, meh gear. lol
[2:20:56] <AmuserName> But it has music though?
[2:20:56] <peachy996> Also it did have music
[2:21:10] <%watts121> @renegade_blade yeah I also got colossus for her and garrus and didn't know that shit was random and lucky.
[2:21:13] <AluxStreams> Even on PS4 these games all run better.
[2:21:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Feros sucks
[2:21:19] <geassguy360> As someone who mods and plays the game every couple years LE was great. Performance and stability much better and no longer have to install 3 hours of textures and upscaled videos
[2:21:20] <SiameseSneeze> Elevators don't take over a fucking minute anymore
[2:21:21] <TourettesPlays> I experienced a TON of bugs that were not in the original tho
[2:21:23] <+dedeec> @dedeec the game looks waaaay better, what are you talking about? I replayed these last month and this looks much better than OG 1
[2:21:24] <tanarath> They buffed minimum weapon stats A LOT
[2:21:25] <ChungusQuest> Intentionally?
[2:21:30] <peachy996> I still do Feros after Therum though, just fits better
[2:21:32] <%DianaTheAscian> intentionally?
[2:21:37] <KaitlynnHere> Why??
[2:21:46] <Profmcstevie> whether that running better is good pc port or "POWER OF THE 3090" I don't know
[2:21:48] <%Raz_Pataz> as someone who's never touched Mass Effect, it'll get me round to finally giving it a try
[2:22:00] <podokdrank> Shepherd has a bald spot
[2:22:03] <%SvenHolgersson> W H A T
[2:22:09] <%dankjerri> i just discovered twitch has dark mode
[2:22:11] <SlippedDisco> haha cool :)
[2:22:15] <+achickenorsomething> well, it is
[2:22:16] <%dekkitout> "So that was a fucking lie?"
[2:22:18] <%ssjklyco> It's on a console , that's stupid
[2:22:19] <%SvenHolgersson> Then change the prompts then assholes
[2:22:20] <%watts121> Casey Hudson hate's players.
[2:22:21] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm a fan of Noveria is my planet of choice. Shit with the two bases and politics made it feel like Citadel 2
[2:22:25] <%Monkeyweed21> it is
[2:22:27] <butthurtdave> Like it was a 360 game originally wasnt it?
[2:22:28] <%StaceMcGate> just like Dust
[2:22:28] <+dedeec> I think using powers is way better in kb/m but maybe that's just me
[2:22:28] <$Wurmspawn> To be honest, I think poeple who say "these games didn't change at all" were too spoiled by fan based mods and patches. Unless you've played these games in vanilla recently you WON'T notice the massive differences.
[2:22:33] <KaitlynnHere> Wtf
[2:22:34] <+wmeldrum> playing me3 on m&k righ tnow and its RUFF
[2:22:35] <%GalacticaPhanto> Hudson was a weak bitch
[2:22:39] <%DJFakie> It was a 360 EXCLUSIVE LAUNCH
[2:22:39] <%Monkeyweed21> the game was made for a hotbar
[2:22:41] <TourettesPlays> I had a real rough time on Virmire so I'm curious to see what your experience is Pat
[2:22:43] <+D00msDayDan> does this game still have a hotbar if you play KBM?
[2:22:45] <sgtbloopface> its worse than that, ME3 DID have controller support but you had to buy a specific ME branded controller to access it
[2:22:58] <Dfreddy8> Geth incursion is long
[2:23:02] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> I prefer M&K but anygame that uses spacebar as an interact button is not designed with M&K in mind
[2:23:03] <UFOLoche> Oof
[2:23:05] <+glgzephyr> @sgtbloopface What the actual shit?
[2:23:09] <+mlow44> I mean it's fucked they ripped out controller support but I don't get the argument that it's better on controller
[2:23:14] <TourettesPlays> @D00msDayDan yes and LE has a bug where selecting powers thru the wheel makes them not happen for some reason
[2:23:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> More like Horse head deez nuts
[2:23:19] <Vantesla> Gunplay in ME1 is better/easier as no longer a dice role to hit even if dead on. Only nerf gameplay that made it easier actually is to Immunity. Given Immunity on Insanity was used by many enemies besides Krogan Battle Masters. Does slightly nerf Soldier and Infiltrator as no Perma immortality
[2:23:20] <butthurtdave> That incursion one takes forever, but it's for Tali so it's mandatory
[2:23:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Sarens summoned like 90 reapers
[2:23:23] <ape_hawk> the whores head nebula?
[2:23:34] <%SvenHolgersson> ME isn't even fun on KB+M
[2:23:34] <geassguy360> its not doom, its not much BETTER on M&KB either
[2:23:51] <+glgzephyr> @mlow44 Whether or not it's better on controller is irrelevant. People should be able to play the game as they like
[2:24:02] <%SvenHolgersson> Does Pat know anything about 3?
[2:24:04] <%StaceMcGate> I remember the DLC for ME 1 being very weak, and the Batarian one impossible to install
[2:24:06] <%DJFakie> ^
[2:24:06] <geassguy360> @glgzephyr exactly
[2:24:07] <%SvenHolgersson> Like characters?
[2:24:07] <%luckysteak> @PatStaresAt Hi pat, are you enjoying the best mass effect game?
[2:24:09] <butthurtdave> This is for that guy on the citadel right?
[2:24:12] <+mlow44> @glgzephyr Yes I agree, that's why I said it's fucked they took out controller support
[2:24:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Member when you had to move a cursor around the planet and shoot probes
[2:24:17] <%watts121> This is gonna be funny with ME2 strip mining.
[2:24:18] <peachy996> ye
[2:24:26] <%luckysteak> yay
[2:24:28] <+dedeec> @SvenHolgersson Pat is known for never having expressed his opinion on ME3
[2:24:32] <%AncelDeLambert> @SvenHolgersson he knows everything that got meme'd to death and has heard what everyone talked about
[2:24:35] <TourettesPlays> tfw making EDI inhale all the gas on Uranus

[2:24:48] <%StaceMcGate> Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss Squad
[2:24:49] <ape_hawk> GIRLS GET IT ON!
[2:24:50] <%VioletHeart> Sounds about right.
[2:24:50] <+senfood> ME3 is going to be fun to watch.
[2:24:51] <thelonechris> Cheerleader, So and So, Whatserface, the Ugly One!
[2:24:52] <%AncelDeLambert> you'll have lots of fun with the two bits that are good
[2:24:52] <%Raz_Pataz> as opposed to every other game you play?
[2:24:52] <Psyramics> @Pookiedaexzile that's ME2
[2:24:53] <AluxStreams> ME3 is a lot better in comparison to MEA.
[2:24:53] <%AzureGale> CHEERLEADER
[2:24:53] <%afronooch> I miss video games
[2:24:55] <peachy996> I know I'll have fun yelling
[2:24:56] <%watts121> I knew Mass Effect was an isekai.
[2:24:56] <%afronooch> I miss my mom
[2:24:57] <%SvenHolgersson> Uncle Pat WOULD bring the young looking girls to a hostile planet
[2:24:58] <%dankjerri> no yell, only DESTROY
[2:24:59] <$Wurmspawn> Miranda isn't here so "cheerleader" is in the squad this time.
[2:24:59] <+shapeforn> ME1 def has a different more Hard Sci-Fi vibe, ME2 is more "cinematic" i guess but still really friggin good
[2:25:01] <%Mekhet09> TBH I think it's way worse then people say it is. AT least for me.
[2:25:01] <%AzureGale> WHAT'S-HER-FACE
[2:25:02] <Profmcstevie> Aggressively enjoy yourself with 3
[2:25:02] <butthurtdave> Do old mods still work on LE?  cuz i'd recommend getting that "get all resources on a planet witih one probe" mod for ME2
[2:25:03] <aiutare47> its equal parts fun and stupid fun and stupid
[2:25:05] <arkv01> if you didn't yell, I'd be more spooked
[2:25:06] <geassguy360> god HSR does not age a day
[2:25:07] <peachy996> I HATE 3 but only care for the MP
[2:25:07] <%AzureGale> THE UGLY ONE!
[2:25:08] <rekinom> Is that what you Mass Expect? @PatStaresAt
[2:25:08] <$Wurmspawn> isn't*
[2:25:12] <+glgzephyr> I miss HSR
[2:25:12] <%DianaTheAscian> is that not what most people do when they play me3?
[2:25:14] <KaitlynnHere> Is Paige home?
[2:25:15] <wolfen091> can't you just be quietly disappointed like the rest of us
[2:25:16] <%dankjerri> Dont look at the planet
[2:25:18] <+dedeec> ME3 is my favorite even if the ending ain't great
[2:25:20] <%SirGO0SE> BOOOOO
[2:25:22] <+TheMadeMember> booo
[2:25:23] <peachy996> I hate 3 so much and yet I played so much
[2:25:23] <%Monkeyweed21> most of 3 is good
[2:25:23] <%Treuan> BOOO
[2:25:24] <mak0t0yukii> booooo
[2:25:25] <%GalacticaPhanto> LUL LUL LUL

[2:25:29] <thelonechris> That made me wanna Mass Eject
[2:25:30] <tanarath> GOTTEM

[2:25:33] <%emperordread> Liara makes me mass erect
[2:25:34] <penitentpendant> ... as long as his mass isn't erect
[2:25:35] <stantheman_97> BOOOOO
[2:25:41] <geassguy360> 3 is best gameplay, hit and miss story. Krogan and Geth/Quarian plots are legit great.
[2:25:43] <butthurtdave> what bargain?
[2:25:45] <+glgzephyr> ?
[2:25:46] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat do you like thane?
[2:25:50] <penitentpendant> Didn't you mention Karth though?
[2:25:53] <%MassConnect> Last stream, no. You said carth at the 3 hr mark
[2:25:54] <aiutare47> Pat you made a "ligma" joke like ten minutes ago
[2:25:56] <%DianaTheAscian> oh yeah
[2:25:58] <Earthun> I open stream I see MAKO I click off stream
[2:25:59] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> To not mention Star Wars comparisons
[2:25:59] <+red_cuppa> he made a bet not to mention star wars by name
[2:26:01] <penitentpendant> Or was that all prestream?
[2:26:02] <%Treuan> Oh the star wars thing?
[2:26:02] <Pookiedaexzile> You said Han Solo
[2:26:03] <%NateyBeak> every time youve mentioned karth you lost
[2:26:03] <%MassConnect> But today, yes.
[2:26:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat gonna make dat money for not referencing Star Wars
[2:26:09] <%AzureGale> Objection noted.
[2:26:15] <+glgzephyr> WhaT cOulD hAvE donE tHIS!?
[2:26:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh and you mentioned Carth
[2:26:28] <%Monkeyweed21> ME3 has definitive endings to the Quarian/geth conflict AND the Krogan Genophage
[2:26:31] <%dankjerri> if i wanted to see clemps would i go to Mass Essex or East Effect?
[2:26:31] <%GalacticaPhanto> HACK THE PLANET
[2:26:31] <Pookiedaexzile> And H3

[2:26:44] <butthurtdave> go machinist to max her shields
[2:26:45] <%StaceMcGate> Pat is going to be one shotting Krogans and Geth Elites by end-game
[2:26:46] <%Treuan> Machinist?
[2:26:46] <%justcallmebobplease> @MassConnect Pat DID say 'Carth' IIRC, and Carth IS a Star Wars character... but was that the level of reference disallowed, though?
[2:26:47] <ape_hawk> heavy metal discovered? where can we find disco?
[2:26:48] <%isa_sensei96> Hacking
[2:26:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> Hacking is a good idea.
[2:26:51] <tanarath> @patstaresat finding all of the ore & minerals gives a SHIT TON
[2:26:56] <TourettesPlays> AI hacking is boss as fuck in 2 and 3 but basically useless in 1
[2:27:02] <Pookiedaexzile> @Dfreddy8 Oh we gonna fuck a quarian alright
[2:27:05] <geassguy360> sure hope pat does the quarian/geth peace like a true commander shepard

[2:27:52] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> ur barrier was too stong
[2:27:56] <KaitlynnHere> Oop
[2:27:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no the Freakers got in Mass effect
[2:28:01] <%JoshManVGH> Barrier too good.

[2:28:11] <butthurtdave> i've had a few bugs with the game, like not being able to interact with objects. fixed witih a save/reload tho
[2:28:17] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[2:28:17] <%Monkeyweed21> #FreakerGang
[2:28:18] <TourettesPlays> @bread_assassin Its pretty much useless considering biotics go thru shields
[2:28:18] <KaitlynnHere> Big save
[2:28:25] <Dunmarkh> YEAH
[2:28:35] <Vantesla> Great thing is get a better amp and it improves barrier besides all biotic.
[2:28:37] <penitentpendant> Increases uptime
[2:28:39] <TourettesPlays> oh no pat why is your barrier so low oh noooooooo
[2:28:47] <%psidefx> Aegis reflector
[2:28:47] <Psyramics> barrier's cd is shorter than its duration at  high levels, so you are invincible
[2:28:50] <%Mekhet09> Biotic is op.
[2:28:52] <Vantesla> Would recommend boosting Barrier LUL ironmouseDERP
[2:28:54] <%Mekhet09> Space wizards rule.
[2:28:55] <%dankjerri> these stats confuse pat almost as much as Vampire thr Masquerade

[2:32:31] <%Ynkubus_> Goddamn space boobit worms!
[2:32:31] <%StaceMcGate> I always fought Maw's outside of the Mako, as you get double exp for killing them and their projectiles easy to dodge
[2:32:34] <%dankjerri> exploud
[2:32:34] <TourettesPlays> in the original Thresher Maws would spawn underneath you and kill you instantly it fucking sucked
[2:32:36] <$dalmek> more like Thresher Naw, Man
[2:32:36] <%dekkitout> Is there a mod that replaces renegade or paragon options with Zapp lines?
[2:32:38] <Dfreddy8> YOU CAN MOVE
[2:32:42] <geosspone> you can move while you're being repaired now
[2:32:47] <peachy996> Have to hand it to them for adding the tentacles in
[2:32:50] <%Mekhet09> @TourettesPlays There were a lot of thresher maw bugs.
[2:32:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Thresher maw, the only Animal capable of space travel that doesn't shit itself at the mention of reapers
[2:32:52] <%luckysteak> does the acid pierce shields?
[2:32:59] <$Wurmspawn> But you can't attack.

[2:33:33] <ScreamLord> @penitentpendant "Wait humans EAT salt? One of the most toxic substances in the galaxy!?" It makes things taste good
[2:33:34] <TourettesPlays> Thresher Maws are a problem on every planet somehow even tho that makes no sense
[2:33:34] <%MidnightBurst12> Oh god
[2:33:35] <peachy996> Oh this asshole wants to one shot you
[2:33:36] <%walternatorz> they didn't have time to write it down with all the mawing going on
[2:33:39] <+red_cuppa> particularly if you have the sole survivor background
[2:33:41] <%dekkitout> That was the Diablos Black of Thresher fights
[2:33:41] <butthurtdave> Get excited, there's like 10 of them in the game
[2:33:43] <%StaceMcGate> oh wow, did they upgrade the maws in this version? I remember them being stationary

[2:34:18] <+gksnipa> i kinda wish they improved the planet exploration instead of ourright removing or simplifying it in the later games
[2:34:21] <+glgzephyr> I mean, she IS a redhead
[2:34:21] <%dankjerri> she's a Jumping Spider, obviously
[2:34:25] <+dedeec> @Pookiedaexzile they're doing another one

[2:34:29] <%SvenHolgersson> She's gunna wake up as Black Arachnia
[2:34:29] <TourettesPlays> Pat killing paige is much more likely
[2:34:30] <Dunmarkh> but paige isn't black yet?
[2:34:31] <penitentpendant> Something something she swallowed a fly?
[2:34:31] <%Dakuu75> She's half Mold, Half Spider, all Ginger~

[2:34:57] <ChungusQuest> wait what?
[2:34:58] <Vantesla> If she is a black widow. You never see it coming

[2:35:10] <%Dakuu75> I loved that movie
[2:35:11] <logothete2401> what?
[2:35:12] <%dekkitout> Is the creator of babaduk lgbtqiaor somethin?
[2:35:12] <Samurai_Tchan> BABADuke gay icon ?
[2:35:13] <+dedeec> it's because he's gay
[2:35:18] <%Monkeyweed21> The Lycanthropy Lupus gives a 90% reduction to poison damage
[2:35:30] <%Dakuu75> "Why can't you just be normal?!", "AAAAAAAAAAAAAH~!" lmao
[2:35:30] <%SvenHolgersson> Wh
[2:35:31] <+Gespens> yeah, that's why
[2:35:32] <wasdsf> LUL
[2:35:32] <+BIumen> oh RIGHT
[2:35:32] <AluxStreams> Yeah that's the origin.
[2:35:32] <%JamesCorck> Correct.
[2:35:33] <$dalmek> yes, I was just about to say
[2:35:38] <%CoffeeKaiju> that's right
[2:35:39] <%dekkitout> Ah. That's a pretty strong origin
[2:35:40] <Khester824> Did you hack the rock?
[2:35:41] <%JamesCorck> The Netflix algorythm did a weird.
[2:35:42] <SlippedDisco> ours now
[2:35:45] <Pookiedaexzile> BabaDuke is about being so gay you hate your son
[2:35:48] <Dunmarkh> alright that's understandable
[2:35:52] <Dfreddy8> IT'S A TRAP
[2:35:53] <%RetroCop87> Is Topcat gay, or is he just flamboyant?
[2:35:56] <%Dakuu75> LMFAO
[2:35:56] <peachy996> Ah the Ol' Geth Gotcha
[2:35:57] <wasdsf> LUL LUL

[2:36:00] <%mike2hands> LUL LUL LUL
[2:36:01] <+BIumen> i was so lost in the meme i forgot that even happened
[2:36:03] <Gorshum> LUL
[2:36:03] <+senfood> BABADOOK ERASURE
[2:36:06] <%SvenHolgersson> Babadook is an ally
[2:36:06] <Samurai_Tchan> 360 n ALSO APPEARS EVERYWHERE that stupid movie
[2:36:07] <KaitlynnHere> Yea they sometimes put mature content in the kids selection too
[2:36:08] <+Gespens> Then people tried to do the same for Pennywise and ignored the fact that Pennywise is literally a child predator
[2:36:09] <%SvenHolgersson> Love it
[2:36:11] <%The_Protagonist> the BiBiDook
[2:36:11] <%NocturneNovember> Can confirm, I am the Babadook
[2:36:12] <ChungusQuest> okay, so random chaotic association
[2:36:12] <arkv01> :) checks out
[2:36:13] <KaitlynnHere> Lol
[2:36:13] <Clowns> Bibadook
[2:36:14] <Profmcstevie> Improvise, adapt,overcome. babadook
[2:36:15] <SociopathicApe> My dad's a babadook!
[2:36:15] <%Ravioli_Ronin> I love that so much LUL woolieFABRICATION
[2:36:16] <%Mekhet09> Aren't these encounters scripted? I remember them being way too specific to be procedurally generated.
[2:36:16] <%MidnightBurst12> Guess I'm Babadook now
[2:36:20] <%StaceMcGate> vintage gay icon, Jason
[2:36:23] <%Monkeyweed21> thats how it feels sometimes
[2:36:23] <stantheman_97> does that make me a babadook?
[2:36:31] <%NocturneNovember> Babadooks rise up
[2:36:31] <peachy996> "I was so GAY, But I couldn't tell anybody!
[2:36:32] <Clundy> It’s the Bi-badook
[2:36:32] <%mike2hands> the gabakoob
[2:36:37] <%shurtal> *TRAP PLANET*
[2:36:39] <%JamesCorck> Gotta come out as Babadook now as well.
[2:36:40] <+dedeec> @StaceMcGate but Jason hates sex and anyone who has ever thought of it!
[2:36:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> I'm part Babadook now Sora
[2:36:47] <+tweedler92> We’re all a little babadook
[2:36:52] <%SvenHolgersson> THE FUCKING SOUND EFFECTS
[2:36:54] <%SvenHolgersson> THE LION
[2:36:55] <peanutdot007> @peachy996 Just like Dumbledore
[2:36:56] <%SvenHolgersson> YEYEYYEYEYE
[2:36:59] <+dirtsniffurperson> i like how i finished 1 2 3 and i could find no difference with legendary.
[2:37:01] <wasdsf> clay pot
[2:37:03] <tranquilturnip> potbreak . wav
[2:37:03] <%Dakuu75> but, it's a good roar
[2:37:05] <%dekkitout> Do I then qualify as babaduk-curious?
[2:37:05] <Clowns> ugh
[2:37:06] <%Raz_Pataz> oh god yeah I know exactly what you mean
[2:37:09] <%dankjerri> doom 2
[2:37:14] <%JamesCorck> it's the dolphin sound effect.
[2:37:18] <%RetroCop87> Oh yeah! Pat, did you ever find that Doom shotgun SFX?
[2:37:23] <Samurai_Tchan> generic LEOPARD roar
[2:37:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Nothing is tense in the Baba Dook once you get how petty it all is
[2:37:27] <%JamesCorck> It0s the sound of the dolphin squeaking or something.
[2:37:32] <Clowns> reminds me of the wilhelm scream. i'm so tired of the wilhelm scream.
[2:37:34] <%MidnightBurst12> ROFLing?
[2:37:36] <susukouhai> Baba is Dook
[2:37:39] <%Monkeyweed21> the Geth should give Shephard a big bowl of chili and then he won't be able to leave the ship's bathroom
[2:37:44] <Samurai_Tchan> I hate when those sreems appear
[2:37:45] <%Cozy90> Pat youever watch thoes documentaries on ants? They use lion roars in that too.
[2:37:49] <%Ravioli_Ronin> There’s a lot of public domain sounds/sound reuse that they think no one will notice
[2:37:50] <%shurtal> 1200ish
[2:37:52] <%Mekhet09> 1200
[2:37:52] <%SvenHolgersson> 1228?

[2:37:53] <rekinom> 1228
[2:37:54] <+Romuken> 1228
[2:37:55] <+dirtsniffurperson> i like how the planet surface isn't one polygon

[2:37:55] <Pookiedaexzile> 12 hunnit

[2:38:05] <TheApeGatsby> I'm here :)
[2:38:06] <%isa_sensei96> 1211
[2:38:07] <+Romuken> aw tits 17ppl left
[2:38:07] <Clundy> Geth Chili tastes like iron
[2:38:08] <%DianaTheAscian> 1211
[2:38:08] <peachy996> Wilhelm Scream is meh now the YEEEEEEAAAHHHH is where it's at
[2:38:11] <%watts121> I like the way Feros looks tho.
[2:38:13] <jorniev> OH i forgot about the tank
[2:38:16] <peachy996> Therum is the worst of the planets
[2:38:17] <%watts121> The city part.
[2:38:21] <aiutare47> but its got the Thorian?! Thorian is super cool!
[2:38:24] <+dirtsniffurperson> no mass effect is super long
[2:38:27] <%The_Protagonist> 1200 Geth watching you fall for their trap
[2:38:28] <Pookiedaexzile> If you do Saturday maybe
[2:38:29] <jorniev> I FORGOT ABOUT THE MASTER BLASTER
[2:38:33] <%JamesCorck> You can, if you don't do anything else and stream 10 hours each day.
[2:38:36] <+Ghufufin> what comes out next week>
[2:38:39] <Profmcstevie> You are impassioned about Mass Effect, it's fun to watch and chill
[2:38:40] <%JamesCorck> Which you shouldn't really do.
[2:38:46] <+dirtsniffurperson> thorian takes time to complete
[2:38:53] <Clowns> no you should do that
[2:38:55] <%SvenHolgersson> Andromeda stream when?
[2:38:58] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat you know VTM Bloodlines 2 is out this year too?
[2:38:58] <Samurai_Tchan> imagine turnin the car like that
[2:38:59] <%luckysteak> So pat, are there any significant UI changes you enjoy @PatStaresAt
[2:39:01] <%SvenHolgersson> After 3?
[2:39:03] <%SvenHolgersson> lytSNEER
[2:39:05] <Samurai_Tchan> WOW
[2:39:08] <CapCasual> What's happening next week? I just got here.
[2:39:13] <wasdsf> dragon age 2 hours
[2:39:14] <%logoth_> But there's no time
[2:39:15] <Pookiedaexzile> But they aren't
[2:39:15] <AmuserName> I miss the ENEMIES EVERYWHERE! GOGOGO!
[2:39:16] <Dyllopizzagames> BOO GARBO
[2:39:16] <Dfreddy8> YEP
[2:39:17] <%watts121> Space Walmart only made one Space Trailer and everyone uses it.
[2:39:24] <hat_under_bread> Gotta save on dev time Pat.
[2:39:25] <peachy996> @SvenHolgersson You can watch Paige play it again
[2:39:26] <Pookiedaexzile> they put the cover in different places
[2:39:26] <+gksnipa> enemy variety in one isboretty bad tbh
[2:39:29] <%logoth_> GET YOUR JOLLIES??
[2:39:30] <Samurai_Tchan> ITS THE first game,
[2:39:31] <+Dropkick_Rabbit> @AmuserName NO THEY GOT RID OF THOSE?!?!
[2:39:32] <%luckysteak> They got them all from the same supplier, Shacks R' Us
[2:39:33] <%JamesCorck> Dragon Age 2 had the same issue, with repeat caves.
[2:39:33] <+Romuken> know what you CAN get into tho?  #CuckGarrus
[2:39:36] <Mattais88> At least it makes sense that they're all pre-fabs. What about Dragon Age 2
[2:39:36] <peachy996> YOU WILL DIE
[2:39:38] <%JamesCorck> ME1 has repeat rooms.
[2:39:40] <%Varlinator> "I WILL DESTROY YOU!"
[2:39:41] <%JamesCorck> It's fine.
[2:39:43] <akitanito> dat lens flare
[2:39:44] <BrinstarGardeningSociety> they arrange the boxes in different places sometimes
[2:39:48] <stormhawk9891> @CapCasual A bunch of games like Guilty Gear come out
[2:39:51] <AluxStreams> Makes sense they'd be pre-fab IKEA-hit colony buildings.
[2:39:52] <peachy996> GO GO GO
[2:39:53] <%watts121> Dragon Age 2 has like 5 maps.
[2:39:57] <AmuserName> YOU MUST DIE
[2:39:57] <+RowenCleric> i can acecpt it in this because sci fi stuff would be built to be the same/convenient
[2:39:57] <TourettesPlays> 3 had all those blatant LOOK AT THIS MULTIPLAYER MAP missions but atleast they had level design
[2:40:04] <SlippedDisco> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE D:
[2:40:05] <feralspidey> 10 Hour streams, 5 days a week (not including Monday for CSB or Sunday for time off) with 1200~ viewers... I WOULD SAY THATS WORTH IT.
[2:40:06] <%watts121> And some of the maps are just portions of other maps mirrored.
[2:40:08] <Archmortal> reminds me of the housing situation in Outer Worlds
[2:40:08] <Dfreddy8> When are we doing the Asteroid?
[2:40:11] <+Data7lorE> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE xcalS
[2:40:12] <tanarath> CRATE TO THE LEFT
[2:40:14] <Pookiedaexzile> as a kid I thought the boxes were a smart way to change levels lazily
[2:40:15] <%Monkeyweed21> the ME2 outposts are way better and they still suck
[2:40:15] <CapCasual> @stormhawk9891 ty :)
[2:40:16] <AmuserName> HOLD THE LINE! ENEMIES EVERYWHERE!
[2:40:18] <scht3v3> Almost like they only had a year of dev time or something
[2:40:18] <+glgzephyr> This music has powerful Metroid Prime vibes
[2:40:19] <Pookiedaexzile> likea a theme
[2:40:20] <%Mekhet09> I know people are going to disagree but I still think 2 is better than inqusition.
[2:40:20] <%Teyaric> Also that game was made in like a YEAR. Same issue as KOTOR 2
[2:40:26] <stormhawk9891> YOU MUST DIE
[2:40:27] <ape_hawk> dragon age 2 had less areas than it had months of dev time
[2:40:30] <Sunstalker> With Dragon age 2 it's much worse because you're constantly travelling back to the same place to go through the same dungeon
[2:40:35] <$dalmek> oh no Predator Armour sounds BAD with the way your character looks
[2:40:35] <Samurai_Tchan> @Data7lorE who says that
[2:40:35] <%dekkitout> Does the armor jerk you off too?
[2:40:44] <stormhawk9891> I WILL DESTROY YOU
[2:40:45] <Dunmarkh> does the predator armor give you autism powers?
[2:40:49] <ScreamLord> Predator, Scorpion, Mantis, Colossus. Nothing else matters
[2:40:51] <peachy996> Explorer is the less embarrassing alternative to the phoenix armor
[2:40:54] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt would you be ok with this equipment system if they had kept it for the other installments?
[2:40:56] <Dfreddy8> I WILL DESTROY YOU
[2:40:59] <+dedeec> @dekkitout no but garrus does
[2:41:03] <%DJFakie> When are you getting the Nodachi
[2:41:10] <AluxStreams> Willem Defoe no. :(
[2:41:24] <%HairballCT> F
[2:41:25] <tanarath> missed a crate
[2:41:29] <$dalmek> RIP in Peace Willem Defriend

[2:49:22] <+Gespens> is it "do I have permission to lie"
[2:49:23] <%dekkitout> Is this some variation on the Streisand Effect?

[2:50:02] <+senfood> BOY NO WONDER ELLIOT PAGE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THAT FUCKING GAME
[2:50:03] <%Garthunox> Cant wait for his next game where you play a man defending himself in court against a "corrupt" system
[2:50:04] <Mattais88> I mean, how else can they afford thsoe enormous apartments?
[2:50:06] <$dalmek> SIR DAVID CAGE'S WORDS HUH
[2:50:07] <srv4254> who david?
[2:50:08] <%DianaTheAscian> OH MAN

[2:50:11] <%SvenHolgersson> SIR DAVID OF RACISM

[2:50:11] <%Monkeyweed21> IMAGINE BEING ELLIOT PAGE AND WORKING FOR THIS ASSHOLE
[2:50:12] <Broken_Sonex> "JUDGE ME BY MY WORK."
[2:50:13] <feralspidey> Sir Sextus Maximus
[2:50:14] <Zeif00> Hell yeah he did LUL
[2:50:15] <%dankjerri> Sir David Cage of Gamerton
[2:50:16] <+SargentToughie> But the royal family told me that the royal family wasn't racist. how could they?
[2:50:18] <iosephe> By the Queen of England? It tracks
[2:50:24] <digaogrunge> Chevalier Cage
[2:50:24] <peyodogo> guys wher's the source where can i find this hot goss i must share it with pals
[2:50:25] <Zalapski> David cage has never interacted with a woman before
[2:50:25] <wolfen091> I'm wondering how you can be in court and not be under oath
[2:50:29] <%Varlinator> Wilem Dafoe too.
[2:50:31] <%Raikouija> And he got the HIGHEST REWARD A FRENCH CITIZEN CAN GET
[2:50:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> So is this no more David Cage games or is the ultimate disaster yet to come?
[2:50:44] <wasdsf> except that one creepo guy
[2:50:44] <%MidnightBurst12> That goes for a lot of workplaces
[2:50:44] <geassguy360> yuuup
[2:50:46] <Profmcstevie> Revolving doors mean get the fuck out
[2:50:50] <+senfood> They don't even talk about their involvement.
[2:50:50] <DatAsuna> I love how cage treis to say he can't be hateful because he worked with page. Even though he neither knew that page was gay or trans at the time and therefore he had to be accepting of neither.
[2:50:58] <%Garthunox> there's one or two
[2:50:58] <AngryAsian5> Everyone except for that one dude who always plays an abusive rapist
[2:51:00] <+Ploobie> would rather work for David Cage than Ubisoft.
[2:51:01] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Poor David Bowie
[2:51:02] <+Rekinsinn> Rest in Peace Mr. Bowie
[2:51:03] <%SaiyanShoto> No come back so we can make more of za bad game!
[2:51:03] <%Garthunox> that stick around
[2:51:05] <%JamesCorck> The only guy who repeated was the guy who played Todd in Detroit.
[2:51:06] <peyodogo> i mean the actor for lukas fahrenheit seems to have stuck around, as well as the fat evil
[2:51:13] <%Monkeyweed21> you cant even see the turnover rate at Rockstar cuz they remove people's names from the credits
[2:51:15] <kikoeru_san> God I feel bad for Elliot
[2:51:16] <TourettesPlays> Yea Willem Dafoe loves talking about roles he's played and he's said NOTHING about Beyond
[2:51:16] <%Dakuu75> depressing news
[2:51:18] <SFTengu> oh man
[2:51:19] <$dalmek> revolving doors at 1000 RPM
[2:51:20] <%skeleklng> how much is a douche is Ethan Mars if he's been in all the games
[2:51:21] <SFTengu> i remember this
[2:51:21] <$Wurmspawn> Yeah. I mean especially with how many big names he manages to rope in, you'd think they'd stick around if his work was as good as some make it out to be.
[2:51:23] <peachy996> Bowie never came back for more
[2:51:27] <kikoeru_san> even before he came out
[2:51:28] <%JamesCorck> David Cage is the fat evil.
[2:51:31] <tranquilturnip> :| face
[2:51:32] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt The FBI guy in Detroit is the homeless leader in Beyond
[2:51:34] <%dankjerri> some Leviathan Wakes type shit going on
[2:51:40] <%MidnightBurst12> they're dead
[2:51:41] <%Varlinator> psaBig Trap.
[2:51:41] <peachy996> He'll get his celebrities or breakout stars once but then they leave
[2:51:42] <%JoshManVGH> Let it not be said that David Cage never managed to make people feel some sort of emotion.
[2:51:47] <peachy996> And they don't come back
[2:51:48] <%logoth_> Is this going to end with a shoot out in an identical warehouse from the last one
[2:51:51] <Dfreddy8> NOBOBY remember BTS
[2:51:52] <%Agami23> i wonder how david cage feels about elliot page and his sick abs
[2:51:53] <%Dementedpenguin> I still can't believe that footage with Bowie actually existed. I was shocked.
[2:51:58] <tanarath> @patstaresat did you know that if you stare at the system for like 10 seconds, any hidden stuff will twinkle?
[2:52:02] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Guys we can do it; we can get Bowie’s estate to get cage to remove him from nomad soul
[2:52:04] <ioci2112> disgust is an emotion
[2:52:06] <%Treuan> Damn nice
[2:52:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @skeleklng he's a typical white guy so Cage probably treated him fine
[2:52:07] <%dankjerri> AMOSHAN
[2:52:09] <Sunstalker> Disgust is an emotion
[2:52:10] <%dekkitout> Dangit, all the press stuff I can find is in French and I am not confident in translator's accuracy
[2:52:10] <jorniev> TRUE
[2:52:11] <wasdsf> vindication?
[2:52:16] <+dedeec> David Cage made me successfully feel hype in some DBH moments, I have to say
[2:52:20] <ScreamLord> You mean besides rage and frustration?
[2:52:21] <+D00msDayDan> emoshun
[2:52:22] <%JoshManVGH> He finally did it!
[2:52:22] <%Mekhet09> WHAT HAPPENED WITH DAVID CAGE
[2:52:24] <%JamesCorck> You guys have been calling it for years.
[2:52:27] <$Futurecity10> David cage further proving the french deserved everything they got
[2:52:27] <James_Quivers> Is laughter an emotion?
[2:52:29] <BigNerdSam> AEY-MOH-SHUNS!
[2:52:32] <$hattrick61> but were they EEMOSHUNS
[2:52:35] <DatAsuna> I know actual people IRL who cite detroit as informing how they think about activism and that upsets me.
[2:52:36] <%MidnightBurst12> Many Emotions
[2:52:37] <%JamesCorck> God, all those critics sucking Cage's dick for years.
[2:52:37] <+D00msDayDan> emotion combos
[2:52:38] <+Ploobie> what is going on with Mr. Cage?
[2:52:38] <%Aeoneth> @PatStaresAt Bile ins not an emotion
[2:52:43] <balthazar758> catharsis
[2:52:43] <%Raikouija> As the Saddness turned into, the angry?
[2:52:46] <+glgzephyr> @Mekhet09 Just google Quantic Dream trial article
[2:52:55] <%dankjerri> BRAIN CHEMICALS
[2:52:57] <Dfreddy8> I CAN SEE THEM
[2:53:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Member when people praised cage as teh future of narrative gaming
[2:53:06] <+dedeec> Sadness Arc OVER: Anger Arc BEGINS
[2:53:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Now his type of game is what you make when you don't have money
[2:53:18] <peachy996> Yeah this planet is a good satan
[2:53:19] <fairore> yeahhh
[2:53:20] <%SvenHolgersson> Uncle Pat feels at home here
[2:53:24] <tanarath> @ploobie google the court info, it's probably the worst trash fire that's existed.
[2:53:25] <+Ploobie> so Quantic Dream and Ubisoft have been bastards to their employees. What is up with the French?
[2:53:25] <%SvenHolgersson> Safe and warm
[2:53:27] <Mattais88> The fuck? There's something the mako can't climb?
[2:53:29] <ScreamLord> Eh, it's Beelzerbub at worst
[2:53:30] <+glgzephyr> YEP
[2:53:30] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[2:53:35] <wasdsf> their games are also shit so that helps
[2:53:37] <BigNerdSam> Speaking slurs and crying in court is a failure of the game designer
[2:53:41] <+RowenCleric> isnt france going through its own super conservative government transitions right now?
[2:53:43] <%DianaTheAscian> YUP
[2:53:45] <akitanito> I think people who were praising him were crazy
[2:53:45] <FlorrNion> all my homies hate Quantic Dream
[2:53:49] <ape_hawk> garmes churnalism
[2:53:49] <%dankjerri> @dedeec Sadness Lobby arc over, Cancelled 7 arc now
[2:53:51] <xcompleasedad> I WONDER WHY LUL
[2:53:59] <+wmeldrum> nothing like justification for "premature" judgement
[2:54:01] <Dunmarkh> beyond two holes
[2:54:01] <jorniev> TURNS OUT
[2:54:03] <%Agami23> wait, was there new stuff?
[2:54:04] <%JamesCorck> Yepp.
[2:54:04] <AmuserName> Thanks for the SEA OF SOLITUDE CODE LUL
[2:54:05] <Zalapski> ...people liked Fahrenheit??
[2:54:05] <wasdsf> fucking asuras wrath is better than the qt games
[2:54:05] <+glgzephyr> IT'S A TRAP
[2:54:05] <SociopathicApe> Fun days
[2:54:10] <TourettesPlays> Quantic Dream is kind of like Mass Effect where a lot of the enjoyment is shittalking the stupid parts
[2:54:11] <%DianaTheAscian> YOU JUST FELT SOMETHING
[2:54:12] <ape_hawk> did wrex just admiral ackbar????
[2:54:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> This fanbase saw through to the shit inside from the beginning
[2:54:14] <%JamesCorck> You guys were always super justified to shit all over those games.
[2:54:17] <%JamesCorck> Those "games".
[2:54:19] <%Varlinator> ohnPanic
[2:54:19] <stantheman_97> games "journalism"
[2:54:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Adios is Pretty good
[2:54:21] <DatAsuna> The only thing I will concede cage is good at is making music.
[2:54:25] <%JamesCorck> God, Indigo Prophecy is the worst game ever.
[2:54:26] <%SaiyanShoto> I can't wait to tell my friends who are Quantic Dreams fans LUL
[2:54:26] <Mattais88> HIDE THIS BODY! is really strong
[2:54:27] <%Arancet> until dawns still the best one
[2:54:29] <Pookiedaexzile> but That was made by a cool person
[2:54:30] <ScreamLord> You Matt and Woolie always shat on Cage on the old channel. And now you're all vindicated
[2:54:32] <DatAsuna> and that was back on like the snes lol
[2:54:39] <BeezusHrist> qUANTIC DREAM WON those lawsuits doe...
[2:54:41] <+glgzephyr> I really should watch that Heavy Rain LP. It's the only one I haven't seen
[2:54:48] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat Asura's Wrath is a fantastic narrative game, wtf you talkin about
[2:54:48] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt  Does Walking Dead count towards that genre?
[2:54:50] <%AncelDeLambert> god he maxed out charm already
[2:54:53] <%peanutdot007> @PatStaresAt from a distance Omikron was possibly the best comedy ever made though
[2:54:55] <$Futurecity10> the only french guy I like is my FC guild leader. He's a nice guy
[2:54:59] <+dedeec> @glgzephyr why NOT IT'S GREAT
[2:55:01] <+Ploobie> While Naughty Dog was applauded and given hundreds of awards for their abusive work environment.
[2:55:02] <%GalacticaPhanto> I remember people getting viciously upset at you guys in every playthrough including Omnikron like it was the ultimate in game writing
[2:55:05] <%Garthunox> "Game overs are a failure of the game designer"
[2:55:09] <generalve> @patstaresat do you think the new mako controls are better or still shit
[2:55:13] <Dunmarkh> @glgzephyr there's two playthroughs, one with woolie and one without
[2:55:14] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Wrex!!
[2:55:15] <%saadi90> Walking dead season 1 and Wolf among us are S-Tier
[2:55:16] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt You were always right about Quantic Dreams, but Rats can swim until they are put on trial
[2:55:16] <%AncelDeLambert> this has become an open world game in which you finish 80% of the game's content at 15% MSQ completion
[2:55:19] <stantheman_97> you can never trust the french
[2:55:20] <%JamesCorck> Yepp, game overs.
[2:55:26] <DatAsuna> better is relative
[2:55:29] <+glgzephyr> @dedeec No good reason. Just never got around to it
[2:55:33] <DatAsuna> but yes, "better"
[2:55:33] <+glgzephyr> @Dunmarkh Which is better
[2:55:41] <%Dementedpenguin> Wait, people got mad at the Monikron LP? LUL
[2:55:44] <%AncelDeLambert> WEEEEHAHAHOOIE!
[2:55:44] <+athuramn> "in the open space, there is a lack of tits" David cage is a real piece of work
[2:55:46] <%Dementedpenguin> *Om
[2:55:47] <%dankjerri> I still want Asura's Wrath 2, guys
[2:55:47] <Profmcstevie> The fact it just seems to be a weight increase is hilarious, what a quick and simple fix
[2:55:54] <ScreamLord> It still controls like a Brick, but no longer a Flailing Brick
[2:55:58] <BeezusHrist> Quantic dream successful defended itself against "toxic" workplace accusations
[2:56:01] <generalve> they redid the sound design for a lot of weapons in the first game
[2:56:02] <peachy996> Heavy Rain LP is the genesis of Matt's hatred of Ethan Mars
[2:56:06] <peachy996> Good times.
[2:56:07] <$Clarke1010> FUCKING WREX? YOU SCRUB
[2:56:10] <%OrangeMDT> @patstaresat is this a very new court case?
[2:56:10] <%StaceMcGate> @dankjerri I'd rather just have an anime
[2:56:11] <wasdsf> @dankjerri plz
[2:56:11] <%logoth_> Off to the pile of space bricks
[2:56:12] <DatAsuna> @Dementedpenguin QD subreddits were well aware of sbfp and quite disliked them
[2:56:16] <%Eilocke> just don't try to take it up too steep of a slope
[2:56:19] <+glgzephyr> @Dunmarkh Or rather, which would you recommend?
[2:56:22] <Dunmarkh> @glgzephyr flip a coin
[2:56:23] <%Dementedpenguin> oof
[2:56:24] <viewtifulr> off screen in the Mako is just going off on the geth
[2:56:29] <+glgzephyr> verdict is coming down on the 8th I think
[2:56:35] <viewtifulr> *tali is
[2:56:37] <+glgzephyr> oh July 8th
[2:56:37] <geosspone> I just finished all the Firewalker and Overlord missions and can I just say
[2:56:38] <Mattais88> So a month of this?
[2:56:40] <geosspone> FUCK the Hammerhead
[2:56:41] <%dankjerri> @stacemcgate I need my QTEs
[2:56:43] <Sol_Install> yea
[2:56:54] <Pookiedaexzile> But they're going up againist a Knight
[2:56:54] <%OrangeMDT> Oooh
[2:56:57] <ScreamLord> Unless QD buys their way out
[2:56:57] <%NateyBeak> "that means we can lie, right?" LUL
[2:57:03] <%emperordread> "You interfere with my biznesss" is a very versatile quote for memes
[2:57:04] <generalve> I saw your username in citrus fighter lobbies yesterday
[2:57:05] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean I a knights world is honor
[2:57:08] <Dfreddy8> ITS MADE OF PAPER
[2:57:09] <+glgzephyr> @Mattais88 Nah, there's just a wide gap between trial and verdict
[2:57:10] <BeezusHrist> They might not be...
[2:57:13] <peachy996> that's what the name was, Hammerhead
[2:57:15] <+athuramn> eh, defamation laws are different over there. who knows these days
[2:57:16] <geosspone> even the old Mako is better than the fucking Hammerhead
[2:57:22] <BeezusHrist> if they printed libel
[2:57:24] <%Maids4lyfe> so what did I miss? david cage is a bigger scumbag than what people thought?
[2:57:26] <%Landralin1996> Man this minigame is so much better than the 360 one
[2:57:28] <peachy996> Yeah nah even the Nomad is better than the Hammerhead
[2:57:36] <%dankjerri> no banging out
[2:57:37] <%SvenHolgersson> Uncle Pat wishes he was banging something else
[2:57:37] <ape_hawk> banging them like youre gonna bang tali
[2:57:42] <%Dementedpenguin> @Maids4lyfe yup.
[2:57:50] <DatAsuna> the hammerhead sucks
[2:57:51] <%Maids4lyfe> thanks!
[2:57:51] <viewtifulr> We'll bang ok?
[2:57:53] <Pookiedaexzile> ME 2
[2:57:56] <%JamesCorck> They were bad.
[2:57:56] <AngryAsian5> Firewalker's pretty shit
[2:57:58] <+glgzephyr> it got quite a lot
[2:58:01] <%emperordread> Firewalker is what my detective called himself in Disco
[2:58:01] <DatAsuna> The nomad was decent, that was andromeda's vehicle
[2:58:01] <peachy996> The Nomad is from Andromeda don't worry about it
[2:58:03] <%JamesCorck> Yes it sucks, the hammerhead blows.
[2:58:06] <TourettesPlays> DLC that remains full price to this day
[2:58:09] <%Dementedpenguin> @Maids4lyfe like what you know/thought about him times 3
[2:58:11] <Dunmarkh> @Maids4lyfe david cage being a cumbag is proven in court
[2:58:11] <KeystoneA2> Because most of the DLC was supposed to be in the game
[2:58:13] <Radioactive_Jam > oh cool
[2:58:17] <+NeonLight> That DA armor is sick
[2:58:22] <wasdsf> those armors are awesome
[2:58:22] <%ingman112> A lot of it was free
[2:58:24] <%StrawberryPantsu> Nice
[2:58:25] <wolverinewaswrong> Mass effect 2 had the best DLC
[2:58:25] <geosspone> yeah you have to buy them or craft them
[2:58:28] <Minorou> they're just on in-game vendors now
[2:58:28] <jorniev> wll i freaking hope so
[2:58:30] <Blackscience91> Hey Pat, just want to say I won my first ranked match in VF by spamming low punch. Thanks for the pro strats.
[2:58:30] <Dfreddy8> You mean ME3?
[2:58:30] <Mattais88> I Forgot about the knight armour!
[2:58:31] <+glgzephyr> @TourettesPlays I thought the DLC comes with LE?
[2:58:32] <%Eilocke> it'd be great if they incorporated that armour into the lore
[2:58:33] <+RowenCleric> isnt there a dead space armor too or something?
[2:58:33] <%Maids4lyfe> @Dementedpenguin holy shit
[2:58:34] <ScreamLord> Hammerhead was basically a floating MAKO and the Nomad is a better MAKO in Andromeda
[2:58:35] <geosspone> with in game credits
[2:58:36] <Technicaus> wait, what DA armor?
[2:58:37] <DatAsuna> for ME3 a lot of pre-order DLC was scattered around
[2:58:37] <wolverinewaswrong> Zaeed's mission is hype
[2:58:40] <BeezusHrist> @Dunmarkh it actually was not proven in court
[2:58:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Member having to log into Cerberus
[2:58:41] <Minorou> oh yeah, and the crafting too
[2:58:45] <wasdsf> for some reason I still remember the gamestop pre-order bonus commercial for the terminus armor pack
[2:58:47] <%dekkitout> @emperordread That's an incredible game, given the situations it puts the player in
[2:58:47] <+Ploobie> Does anyone think that they're going to add ME3 multiplayer to Legendary Edition? After all, it has paid loot boxes.
[2:58:48] <%logoth_> It is being done
[2:58:48] <peachy996> Is that Black Hole super weapon in there
[2:58:51] <TourettesPlays> The Mattock Assault Rifle in 2 is very good
[2:58:52] <DatAsuna> it will be good for all those guns to be just rolled in normal
[2:58:54] <BeezusHrist> @Dunmarkh it was actually tossed out
[2:58:58] <akitanito> true
[2:59:02] <wasdsf> @peachy996 ya
[2:59:03] <%dekkitout> *name
[2:59:04] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt As someone who 100%ed andromeda. yeah, it is
[2:59:08] <ape_hawk> its not as good as this game, tho
[2:59:12] <geosspone> that aspect is part of why I actually liked Andromeda
[2:59:12] <%afronooch> andromeda is an inverse me1 in a lot of ways
[2:59:14] <Mattais88> So much more interesting than scanning planets in 2
[2:59:15] <%skeleklng> Are you gonna play Andromeda after 3?
[2:59:19] <+dedeec> Andromeda is not as bad as people say it is tbh
[2:59:19] <peachy996> Yeah pretty much
[2:59:20] <geassguy360> yeah i did not hate the exploration in andromeda
[2:59:23] <DatAsuna> @Ploobie They said they might if there's demand. People are very vocal about wanting it back, me included.
[2:59:26] <jorniev> i liked the jumping idea in andromeda
[2:59:27] <%Varlinator> It's actually very nice they did that. I much prefer it now to the OG where you just get a bunch of DLC guns right from the get go.
[2:59:27] <+TheotherKristian> Twas one of the only good things about that game, it was just the dragon age inquisition loop with Mass Effect
[2:59:28] <hat_under_bread> They also spent way more time getting the driving mechanics right and had world design that wasn't just a random bump map.
[2:59:32] <DatAsuna> I played more MP than SP tbh
[2:59:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Defending "my Face is tired" is not gonna happen in this chat
[2:59:42] <$Futurecity10> EH-TAH
[2:59:43] <TourettesPlays> The problem with Andromeda is that every character is as boring as Jacob
[2:59:46] <$Futurecity10> Fuck
[2:59:51] <peachy996> I had a lot of comfy moments exploring around the planets in andromeda, then you have to talk to the ugly people
[2:59:54] <DatAsuna> YEah Andromeda's design doc is like an AU where they tried to continue with the ME1 concepts
[2:59:56] <%dankjerri> creepy49Porpchamp
[2:59:56] <%skeleklng> @PatStaresAt Are you gonna play Andromeda after 3 or gonna say fuck that one?
[2:59:57] <%JamesCorck> Mass Effect 1 is TNG. Mass Effect 2 is DS9. Mass Effect 3 is Enterprise. Andromeda is Discovery.
[3:00:03] <DatAsuna> even stuff like the cover system is an update to ME1
[3:00:03] <+Ploobie> Still can't remap "T" on ME3. That pisses me off, because that's the key I use for melee.
[3:00:04] <TheApeGatsby> ME3 MP had no right to be as good as it was
[3:00:10] <hat_under_bread> Andromeda just got everything that Mass Effect is normally good at wrong.
[3:00:10] <%Eilocke> what's with the loot that occasionally shows up when you open your equipment?
[3:00:20] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> I remember most things from mass effect 1-3. I don’t remember anything from Andramoda
[3:00:20] <TourettesPlays> @Pookiedaexzile What does that line even MEAN???? Like did the writer see the shitty face animation and put that line in as a joke?
[3:00:22] <jorniev> this song is the same in ME2 right?
[3:00:23] <%walternatorz> I got about 50% through andromeda and remember liking the gameplay elements. but the story failed at where the rest of the series excelled
[3:00:27] <peachy996> Bears repeating that Elaaden is bright as FUCK
[3:00:34] <DatAsuna> ME2 barely has inventory
[3:00:45] <+NeonLight> KYLE
[3:00:46] <Mattais88> Space Cult!
[3:00:50] <DatAsuna> the upgrade ui in that was ass
[3:00:51] <%dankjerri> eat my space was Hackett
[3:00:52] <ape_hawk> Kyle? the monster energy drink guy?
[3:00:52] <peachy996> Pausing and unpausing in Elaaden was like Solar Flares going off on your screen
[3:00:59] <AmuserName> Space Kyle!
[3:00:59] <ape_hawk> is he punching holes in space walls?
[3:01:01] <TourettesPlays> @DatAsuna it and 3 have none as a matter of fact
[3:01:02] <%Varlinator> Hey, it's the Ruthless mission
[3:01:03] <Zantetzuken> take down that influencer
[3:01:06] <+titansloth93> wait is this just straight-up Space Waco
[3:01:06] <xcompleasedad> Oh. I forgot about how you were the space CIA LUL
[3:01:09] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Is that admiral voiced by optimus prime/BT?
[3:01:10] <kylejburke> god fucking dammit
[3:01:13] <%DianaTheAscian> oh no
[3:01:15] <stantheman_97> never trust kyles
[3:01:18] <%peanutdot007> Isn't there like a Space ATF for stuff like this?
[3:01:18] <ape_hawk> "Father Kyle" just sounds so wrong
[3:01:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Space Cult time!!
[3:01:22] <peachy996> Aw sweet Father Kyle. This planet has a nice view of Klendagon
[3:01:23] <%MidnightBurst12> "Go silence political dissidents for me."
[3:01:24] <%Dakuu75> "Father Kyle" sounds like something from South Park
[3:01:36] <%Bluwizard21> yall leave kyle alone
[3:01:38] <%dankjerri> its cause they are
[3:01:39] <peachy996> At least I think it's Klendagon
[3:01:41] <AmuserName> Time to get recruited into the biotic cult, Vanguard!
[3:01:41] <%GalacticaPhanto> @bluwizard21 Lance Hendrickson
[3:01:46] <%AllenDeadman> they super are
[3:01:47] <%MelBrooksKA> Father Kyle's Church of Truth
[3:01:48] <peachy996> The view is amazing
[3:01:48] <DatAsuna> One of the underappreciated things about andromeda was getting rid of paragon/renegade in favor of the dragon age "personality type" options instead
[3:01:59] <jorniev> does this have the moon dlc?
[3:02:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Spacoplypse Now
[3:02:01] <%Maids4lyfe> but the Alliance IS the cause of their problems
[3:02:07] <%Bluwizard21> im a good kyle i only punched one hole in a wall and dont drink monster
[3:02:07] <DatAsuna> Paragon/renegade are maybe the biggest problem I have with the trilogy
[3:02:08] <wolverinewaswrong> what's your origin pat?
[3:02:13] <peachy996> Sadly a lot of those personality types are underdeveloped
[3:02:14] <%AbnormalVoid> his mom is a big fat bitch
[3:02:19] <EvanAlmighty210> this is just apocalypse now lol
[3:02:20] <Mattais88> Renegade backstory
[3:02:21] <%Rumbutt> Oh this is the Ruthless background
[3:02:23] <%dankjerri> if there's one guy you should send after a 'biotic rights organization' its a biotic.
[3:02:23] <BeezusHrist> mass effect andromeda was TRASH
[3:02:32] <Dfreddy8> Are Biotics a Minority?
[3:02:35] <DatAsuna> Aye it's not as well executed as DA but it's just a better system
[3:02:35] <$SGrim> @DatAsuna cool idea, but the writing quality shot it in the foot right out the gate.
[3:02:35] <TourettesPlays> @DatAsuna too bad the characters on both sides of the conversation were boring as shit at all times
[3:02:43] <Mattais88> @EvanAlmighty210 Holy shit, it is!
[3:02:53] <BeezusHrist> @Dfreddy8 Of course
[3:02:54] <+sermittens> Alliance seems pretty useless when all they ever do is only call you to fix everything
[3:03:01] <%GarbageNirvana> I forgot the backstories you don't use become sidequests
[3:03:03] <%Dementedpenguin> That sounded like a TNG episode synopsis.
[3:03:03] <TourettesPlays> @Dfreddy8 human biotics are
[3:03:04] <%Garthunox> Torfan is the Ruthless back story
[3:03:05] <ScreamLord> @TourettesPlays I like the lore for the Mattock being humanity's early attempt at a Mass Effect Tech Gun. It's basically a Sci-Fi Winchester Model 1903 (One of the first Semi-Auto rifles ever made)
[3:03:09] <%GarbageNirvana> ...or maybe it's just that one
[3:03:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Biotics are a like what if the mutants from Xmen were made by the government doing small 9/11s
[3:03:11] <jorniev> does this version of the game have the batarioan moon mission?
[3:03:22] <peachy996> Ah yeah it is Klendagon
[3:03:33] <peachy996> Look at THAT PLANET
[3:03:36] <%Rumbutt> Including Earth1
[3:03:37] <BeezusHrist> @jorniev yes
[3:03:40] <+senfood> MOOOOOON
[3:03:41] <peachy996> LOOK HOW SICK IT IS
[3:03:46] <%Maids4lyfe> @Dfreddy8 an extreme minority, the only way to make biotics is to expose pregnant women to EZO radiation and half of the children are born with deadly cancer tumors, only a small percent get space magic
[3:03:56] <$lotharrio> I like the Shephard background where your mom is an admiral going on her own adventures.
[3:04:00] <%dankjerri> biotic s are psychic SPARTAN 2s
[3:04:01] <+glgzephyr> ?
[3:04:05] <Mattais88> Is that the one that the reapers fucked up?
[3:04:05] <peachy996> IT'S SO COOL
[3:04:05] <AmuserName> KLENDAGON! PogChamp
[3:04:14] <%MidnightBurst12> cool
[3:04:16] <+glgzephyr> oh that one
[3:04:16] <karl_rex> Its weird that the Alliance color scheme went from red and white to blue and white in 3
[3:04:19] <Dfreddy8> Yeah i know that part
[3:04:22] <xcompleasedad> Was that the "Fuck it, let's kill a Reaper" weapon?
[3:04:26] <+glgzephyr> too much open space LUL
[3:04:28] <ScreamLord> And it took THAT to take out ONE Reaper a billion years ago
[3:04:29] <%Garthunox> We Endwalkin
[3:04:29] <DatAsuna> Speaking of superweapons, one of the sillier things in ME2 was "We make one reaper per cycle"
[3:04:30] <+glgzephyr> uh oh
[3:04:31] <akitanito> crash?
[3:04:34] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:04:34] <%templar010> RIP

[3:04:40] <stantheman_97> whew
[3:04:41] <%Garthunox> ;|
[3:04:45] <Mattais88> I thought my steam was lagging
[3:04:45] <+glgzephyr> it minimizes him
[3:04:45] <KeiPrime> aww
[3:04:46] <mak0t0yukii> YEAAAH GAME CHOKING
[3:04:46] <DatAsuna> "if you kill one reaper the whole cycle is a refrag"
[3:04:50] <kingmemelord97> !Uptime
[3:04:50] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 5m.
[3:04:51] <%AncelDeLambert> "Please update ITunes" FUCK YOU APPLE
[3:04:52] <NeroInfinite> are thresermaws just those asterod worms?
[3:04:54] <%dankjerri> then close them
[3:04:58] <%dekkitout> Stop having >8 tabs, folks
[3:05:03] <godzookylives> get rid of the porn Pat
[3:05:10] <TourettesPlays> I believe that it's implied that the weapon that damaged Klendagon is the one that destroyed the Derelict Reaper in Me2
[3:05:10] <%Varlinator> @PatStaresAt I thought you were on a Dual-PC setup?
[3:05:15] <$Wurmspawn> Hey, Pat, I only mention this because I know you're trying to go full paragon, but there will be a mission where you have to save drugged up scientists that are being held captive. When you get to that mission, you're gonna want to go in alone as it's far too easy for your squadmates to just kill them despite them being civilian targets.

[3:06:38] <+dirtsniffurperson> a gun that shoots thresermaws would be 1000 war assets
[3:06:42] <Pookiedaexzile> You almost have all the pips full
[3:06:44] <+dirtsniffurperson> no joke
[3:06:52] <%Landralin1996> I remember getting out of the mako to finish off vehicles and threshers because they gave more xp on foot lol
[3:06:56] <ScreamLord> Time flies when playing Mass Effect

[3:07:35] <+dirtsniffurperson> he did it
[3:07:37] <%dekkitout> A gun that shoots Threshers with genophage bombs
[3:07:38] <dirtyh4rr1> pips are pips
[3:07:51] <%Dementedpenguin> Like a cat.
[3:07:53] <Samurai_Tchan> this is some ellon musk tech
[3:07:54] <ToneBacas> everybody inside the Mako just threw up
[3:07:56] <PvtWHudson> Because you say bad bad word things about the TMP.
[3:07:57] <+D00msDayDan> the little thresher that could
[3:08:01] <stantheman_97> the team must be fucking mush in there
[3:08:02] <%MidnightBurst12> sick
[3:08:03] <%dekkitout> Fabulous parallel parking job
[3:08:10] <%JoshManVGH> This new Mako control really nailed the feeling of trying to climb mountains in Skyrim
[3:08:19] <+dirtsniffurperson> thats just the krogons home planet
[3:08:24] <DatAsuna> also to double back to andromeda complaining, the most disappointing thing about that to me is that you don't even explore all of andromeda, just the one nebula.
[3:08:27] <%logoth_> dae brieee
[3:08:29] <%dankjerri> @joshmanvgh trying?
[3:08:33] <EvanAlmighty210> everyone in your squad has a concussion now
[3:08:36] <akitanito> nah man, skyrim horses don't even boost
[3:08:51] <TourettesPlays> the new mako control really nailed the feeling of pounding nails under my fingernails
[3:08:52] <DatAsuna> So the whole galaxy is on ice now and we only even got access to 1% of it
[3:09:01] <+glgzephyr> I loved this part LUL
[3:09:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Tuchanka is a beautiful home world and you will not disrespect it
[3:09:11] <aiutare47> @DatAsuna for me it was the general emptiness, where you just went to planets and did the vault things. I remember nothing about that game at all
[3:09:19] <hat_under_bread> The base controls aren't great, but yeah, this makes it a lot worse.
[3:09:21] <%JoshManVGH> @dankjerri there were some inclines that just denied walking by conventional means.
[3:09:25] <%ssjklyco> The controls got a MAKOver
[3:09:26] <peachy996> @DatAsuna You don't get to re-explore the first planet, Aya is just a hubworld, Can't explore the final planet
[3:09:32] <%Agami23> this is like skyrim mountain climbing
[3:09:32] <karl_rex> What planet is this?
[3:09:33] <Reverend_Godshyne> Bouncing around in the mako like this drove me fuckin crazy
[3:09:34] <akitanito> would be nice if there's a jump
[3:09:35] <%hax_metatron> Is Mako better now?
[3:09:38] <%MidnightBurst12> 8/10 flip
[3:09:41] <%Maids4lyfe> lands on all six just like a cat
[3:09:44] <%dankjerri> @joshmanvgh you weren't trying hard enough
[3:09:46] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So apparently it took one species a billion years ago using a Planet Scarring Super Gun to take out 1 Reaper. The in ME1 it took and multiple fleets. Then in ME3 Reaper died almost as easily as any other ship
[3:09:51] <+StoopKid241> That forward booster must be a game changer for steeper hills.
[3:09:53] <DatAsuna> @AluxStreams Eh, I remember stuff like the sinkholes, some pretty vistas and pools .etc
[3:09:54] <$Futurecity10> Save reloard
[3:09:54] <%MelBrooksKA> They should be throwing up right now
[3:09:58] <%JoshManVGH> @dankjerri TearGlove
[3:09:59] <RetributionP> I want to probe uranus already
[3:10:06] <$KetsuoTaberu> this has happened to me as well
[3:10:08] <%Varlinator> Imagine the Cuphead demo guy trying to drive the Mako!
[3:10:09] <Pookiedaexzile> best loading screen
[3:10:10] <atgithursdays> @PatStaresAt Would you summarize Cardassians v Bajorans as Space Nazis v Space Israel?
[3:10:11] <%SvenHolgersson> Thats an old bug too
[3:10:14] <DatAsuna> The open world bosses were cool, I enjoy any game where the boss actually crosses the map mid fight
[3:10:15] <%dankjerri> me
[3:10:18] <%Jeemukun> yeah I ran into that one too
[3:10:19] <%JoshManVGH> I guess I really wasn't a nord.
[3:10:26] <DatAsuna> It sucked that the final boss was just one of those in a closed room tho
[3:10:27] <auraofdawn> It’s a shame bc I loved exploring planets so much, but fighting mountains at a 90 degree angle killed it for me
[3:10:33] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm looking at this shit right now
[3:10:35] <+dirtsniffurperson> oh yeah the jurno
[3:10:38] <$OranHexthief> always remeber the mako can go full speed sideways at an angle up a hill instead of trying to go straight up @PatStaresAt
[3:10:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Cage is a MASSIVE WHINER
[3:10:41] <$renegade_blade> I was disappointed that the quarian dlc was scrapped from andromeda, but I heard there was a book written

[3:26:46] <%Varlinator> Paragade truly is the BEST way to play
[3:26:50] <+dirtsniffurperson> so does anyone else hear the messed up ship music?
[3:26:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> Paragade, or Renegon? The eternal struggle
[3:26:55] <Mattais88> This is really making me want to pick up the remaster and play through again
[3:26:58] <+dirtsniffurperson> like is that normal?
[3:27:03] <%Varlinator> Be nice to your friends & a complete dick to everyone else
[3:27:07] <Samurai_Tchan> llook ,they are dancing in OMEGA
[3:27:22] <+trackles_64> i finished days gone
[3:27:27] <+aWanderingKaivo> Zangief is the bouncer
[3:27:30] <Samurai_Tchan> pat is a volus here
[3:27:51] <Samurai_Tchan> zangie is a krogan
[3:27:55] <%Dakuu75> Let's go~
[3:27:56] <Samurai_Tchan> elmo a turian
[3:28:11] <+trackles_64> Elmo is controlling  Paige
[3:28:18] <Samurai_Tchan> page is an assari with a wig
[3:28:48] <+dirtsniffurperson> making money in mass effect 1 is super easy
[3:28:51] <%Dakuu75> Reload~
[3:28:58] <+dirtsniffurperson> 2 not so much
[3:29:21] <geassguy360> thats what save editors are for lol
[3:29:37] <+dirtsniffurperson> you are so correct
[3:29:53] <+dirtsniffurperson> there are websites
[3:30:02] <+trackles_64> they nerf3d the currency in 2 super hard
[3:30:12] <Profmcstevie> I do enjoy a game with a half decent economy, not swimming in cash and not perpetually broke
[3:30:16] <+dirtsniffurperson> OH BOY
[3:30:21] <%Dakuu75> Let's go~
[3:30:22] <+dirtsniffurperson> did they
[3:30:49] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, someone needs to make a volus Pat model
[3:30:51] <peachy996> I was thinking about how they canceled the DLC to Andromeda and I think it extends to the multiplayer
[3:31:06] <peachy996> Cuz there are noticable empty gaps next to some characters
[3:31:16] <+dirtsniffurperson> volus pat is too powerful for this world
[3:31:33] <%Dakuu75> psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle
[3:31:35] <Samurai_Tchan> @AncelDeLambert maybe i will
[3:31:38] <+trackles_64> once you get colossus armor in 1, currency is useless
[3:31:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> a biotic god, one might say
[3:31:44] <+mcjimbles> How far is he?
[3:31:51] <%marusux> psaWrong
[3:32:03] <peachy996> Would Paige be a Banshee or a Quarian with a malfunctioning suit
[3:32:06] <%Dakuu75> Reload~
[3:32:07] <%YakumoYomi> I just used the Blood Dragon armor in 2 and 3 because it looked rad
[3:32:12] <Dfreddy8> Just Therum
[3:32:14] <+trackles_64> taking a long time to pee
[3:32:26] <+dirtsniffurperson> @mcjimbles hes at the biotics extremism part
[3:32:27] <geassguy360> post therum, pre virmire
[3:32:28] <Profmcstevie> Is stretch break not pee break
[3:32:29] <peachy996> I say Banshee because instead of the horrible scream you hear "PAAAAAAAAT" instead
[3:32:49] <%Dakuu75> ^
[3:32:49] <+mcjimbles> Ok thanks
[3:32:56] <+Kindan55> where did pat go?
[3:33:05] <+trackles_64> Met I  alot shorter than I remember, finished it in less than 9 hours
[3:33:12] <Dfreddy8> Elmo and Gief can be Ravagers
[3:33:41] <+dirtsniffurperson> its hard to say which part becuase mass effect 1 lets you choose you missions
[3:33:56] <+dirtsniffurperson> there is no perfect order
[3:33:58] <+Kindan55> yeah me1 is short a fuck, is still only like 20 hours with all the side missions.
[3:34:25] <%Dakuu75> Let's Go~
[3:34:31] <+trackles_64> Therum, Feros, Noveria imo
[3:34:31] <+mcjimbles> Yeah but pre virmire gives me a decent enough idea
[3:35:02] <Samurai_Tchan> woolie can be a quarian
[3:35:20] <%Dakuu75> Reload~
[3:35:21] <+Kindan55> only if he gets a built in jetpack.
[3:35:24] <Samurai_Tchan> maximilian can be an elcor
[3:35:29] <+dirtsniffurperson> @Samurai_Tchan woolie is a turian in my mind
[3:35:33] <+trackles_64> killing wrex gives a better outcome for the krogan I've been told
[3:35:52] <Samurai_Tchan> @Samurai_Tchan but elmo has a turian face
[3:35:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> Turian spoiler police
[3:36:03] <+dirtsniffurperson> @trackles_64 it makes solus stay alive
[3:36:14] <+Kindan55> Really? he does all that cool stuff on tuchanka in two though?
[3:36:14] <%MrJerples> been doing runs to max charm and its super easy to get through this game in like a couple hours main line
[3:36:20] <+dirtsniffurperson> ive read the walkthoughs
[3:36:20] <peachy996> Woolie is an Elcor
[3:36:25] <%MrJerples> the bulk of me1 is the side quests
[3:36:35] <+Ghufufin> i can see Elmo as a Hanar
[3:36:39] <Samurai_Tchan> theres those other reaces , the batarians are the ugliests
[3:36:54] <Samurai_Tchan> @Ghufufin yeh
[3:37:00] <+mcjimbles> The batarians really get fucked throughout the series lol
[3:37:04] <+Shubreaker> nah vorcha are def the ugliest
[3:37:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> ME2 sort of is too. I mean, TECHNICALLY the loyalty missions are optional
[3:37:18] <BinaryShuffle> Now I'm no spacist, but fuck Batarians
[3:37:28] <+dirtsniffurperson> mass effect 3 does my boy wrex dirty
[3:37:33] <Samurai_Tchan> @Shubreaker yeh ,they are in baraka's level
[3:37:44] <peachy996> Killing Wrex only ensures Mordin is alive. Dead Wrex and Dead Eve are actually terrible for the Krogan, regardless if you actually went through with the cure
[3:37:45] <+trackles_64> who hate more Quarians or Ashley?
[3:37:51] <Samurai_Tchan> oh no, WOOLIE is the protean guy
[3:37:55] <+Shubreaker> vorcha are straight up space skaven lol
[3:38:02] <%MrJerples> @mcjimbles to be fair most are dirt bags
[3:38:05] <peachy996> Vorcha are just Space Barakas
[3:38:05] <+Kindan55> Pretty sure Batarians are supposed to be analogues of people who got fucked in the middle east.
[3:38:16] <+trackles_64> Vorcha are the oppressed masses
[3:38:32] <Samurai_Tchan> @peachy996 HAHAHAH they are even worst, they cant close their mouths haha
[3:38:35] <%Dakuu75> Reload~
[3:38:36] <+mcjimbles> Yeah true enough
[3:38:40] <+dirtsniffurperson> batarians get krama justice by sheapard in 3 lol
[3:39:05] <%MelBrooksKA> Was that drink always next to Gief in the animation?
[3:39:06] <+dirtsniffurperson> why do you think in the start of 3 sheapard doesn't have the ship?
[3:39:08] <+trackles_64> fuck Bavarians, immaculate smash their relay without warning
[3:39:18] <geassguy360> FFS Saving Mordin is not worth dooming the fuckin Krogan, Salarians live to like 40, mordin is fucking 60, and deep down wants to cure it, just let him fuckin do it.   Do not understand this obsession with saving him some have.
[3:39:20] <+trackles_64> fuck auto correct
[3:39:21] <Samurai_Tchan> so ,no one cloned that protean dude ?
[3:39:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> If Batarians were an analogue of anything I'd kind of think North Korea, but any analogue I can think of seems a stretch to me tbh
[3:39:29] <Samurai_Tchan> also theres the thane race too
[3:39:30] <peachy996> Vorcha have the shortest lifespan out of everybody too, Salarians age longer by a good 20 years or so
[3:40:06] <peachy996> I feel if you don't have Wrex+Eve, what are you doing trying to cure the Genophage?
[3:40:09] <Samurai_Tchan> @peachy996 vorcha probably live one week or something lol
[3:40:16] <+dirtsniffurperson> @geassguy360 as long as i get full paragon its fine
[3:40:16] <+mcjimbles> What do Salesians age to, 40?
[3:40:22] <+mcjimbles> Salrarians*
[3:40:22] <%MrJerples> yeah mordin had a good life, let him go out like a badass
[3:40:30] <$Ziegsy> dog need emptying?
[3:40:30] <+dirtsniffurperson> i need that full paragon in 3
[3:40:34] <peachy996> You need both of them to guide their people. Wreav will only repeat the same mistakes
[3:40:53] <%Dakuu75> Welcome back, nerd.
[3:40:55] <+mcjimbles> Aww shit I feel you on autocorrect @trackles_64
[3:40:57] <Samurai_Tchan> I wish i could see volus withou the suit

[3:41:18] <+dirtsniffurperson> the nude volus
[3:41:23] <%walternatorz> they're not on screen, you could have played it off
[3:41:23] <Mattais88> Already ixing up you're sons names?

[3:41:31] <%HairballCT> psaElmo psaDogchamp elgief

[3:41:47] <SaltyAzteca> Which is awesome
[3:41:48] <+dirtsniffurperson> no
[3:41:53] <theinfamousq> twitch just showed me an ad for Photoshop. Fuk Photoshop
[3:42:01] <+Kindan55> Can do some of them off stream if you want
[3:42:04] <+dirtsniffurperson> you get to probe it for war assets in 3
[3:42:07] <%moonmintparadise> moonmintparadise subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Happy Fun times in Spaces!
[3:42:09] <skeletonkingofmanlets> hello, Patrick
[3:42:11] <+trackles_64> thresher maw time
[3:42:24] <+Shubreaker> spartamis
[3:42:25] <$Wurmspawn> So, I'm sorry from what I've been seeing online is a lot of stuff about how the Quantic Dream won an appeal to the original dismissal of their case. But I'm not finding anything about the current case and quotes that were mentioned by pat earlier in the stream, can someone possibly help point me to where I need to look?
[3:42:27] <Samurai_Tchan> thresh
[3:42:35] <peachy996> Did you ever happen to touch on how confusing the Banes sidequest is
[3:42:42] <+Kindan55> yep
[3:42:46] <SlingPlaysGames> is it time to risk our crews life killing native wildlife that doesn't need to die?
[3:42:53] <$Futurecity10> Pat you are going to find the Orb relic right?
[3:42:56] <peachy996> Good.
[3:42:56] <+trackles_64> he's a dog pat
[3:42:57] <Samurai_Tchan> wee need to find our own mass effect particle
[3:43:03] <%aWanderingKaivo> Quantic Dream, legal case, wha? What did I miss
[3:43:20] <%kewlmyc> Pat has bars
[3:43:22] <Kidbizzaro> Top tier space exploration music
[3:43:25] <wolverinewaswrong> Isn't there a Dragon Age planet hidden here?
[3:43:31] <+trackles_64> dogs act like their owners
[3:43:33] <skeletonkingofmanlets> are you on pyrholidon tonight?
[3:43:39] <ape_hawk> garrus and lockpick
[3:43:41] <stiffybiro> fun fact, the fact you only need 20 keepers isn’t because people always miss one, it’s because one despawns if you fast travel and you need to save and reload for it to spawn back, hence why most people only ever “found” 20/21
[3:43:41] <Samurai_Tchan> Garus is a chad
[3:43:44] <+mcjimbles> Is it the system or the planet? Because I might have missed a few quests on every play through then lol
[3:43:47] <%peanutdot007> Cop-nerd and ner-cop
[3:43:47] <Dunmarkh> @aWanderingKaivo David cage hates gay people, says all women in his games are whores, and ran out of court crying
[3:43:51] <+fetrigon> NEEEEEEERRRRRRRRDDDDDDD
[3:43:53] <+dirtsniffurperson> i don't see any modern new on quantic dreams
[3:43:56] <Samurai_Tchan> liara is nerd
[3:44:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> sick
[3:44:03] <Mattais88> Wait, you can explore Idolas before the climax?

[3:44:37] <+fetrigon> *NEEEEEEERRRRRRRRDDDDDDDSSSSSSS KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[3:44:44] <otakon17> Liara is slightly less adorkable than Tali
[3:44:48] <+dirtsniffurperson> tail love interst confirmed
[3:44:51] <+trackles_64> you could upgrade yours
[3:44:55] <RetributionP> darn
[3:45:02] <otakon17> ...double Tech people?
[3:45:03] <%derpy_platypus> gee, guess I gotta bone you now Tali
[3:45:04] <BinaryShuffle> you're going to have way too many points, he'll be a lockpick eventually
[3:45:06] <SlingPlaysGames> how can David cage hate women when he has no opinions on any topic and makes art totally not about nothing? are you telling me neutrality was just a fake way to get out of talking about it?
[3:45:08] <+Kindan55> just cheat
[3:45:09] <SlingPlaysGames> I'm stunned
[3:45:12] <stantheman_97> i like nerds so it's good
[3:45:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> save editors, ho!
[3:45:12] <stiffybiro> mass effect: the game which gives you fat abilities and even fatter asses
[3:45:13] <+guroburrito> Wow. The driving in remastered....actually looks good wtf
[3:45:14] <+trackles_64> it is when you replay the game
[3:45:14] <Samurai_Tchan> liara and garus are op ,one lift people and garus hit with the rifle
[3:45:18] <%MrJerples> engineer bros rise up
[3:45:18] <%SirGO0SE> everyone is a babe except ashley imo
[3:45:25] <+Kindan55> Big cheats
[3:45:26] <thelonechris> Just cheat 4Head
[3:45:27] <SlingPlaysGames> does the ship work now?
[3:45:30] <otakon17> also not having Electronics/Decryption maxed out is suprising since that locks off a bunch of extra loot for you
[3:45:33] <ape_hawk> HACK THE PLANET
[3:45:38] <Profmcstevie> What is this..."cheating"
[3:45:39] <+fetrigon> so is riding in the mako just super uncomfortable?
[3:45:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> did you just HACK A ROCK
[3:45:47] <+trackles_64> cheating is bad
[3:45:50] <Samurai_Tchan> Statue of liberty hacked
[3:45:54] <+mcjimbles> The legendary scaled exp is pretty good for getting most skills I think
[3:45:55] <%walternatorz> *2 streams later* "I cheated guys"
[3:45:57] <%DJFakie> Just "load a different save"
[3:46:01] <stiffybiro> peepo wouldn’t just go on the vidya game and cheat!!!
[3:46:05] <+Kindan55> Touche
[3:46:09] <SlingPlaysGames> @trackles_64 cheating is only bad if you lose or get caught
[3:46:11] <+dirtsniffurperson> yeah hacking rocks gives you money
[3:46:12] <Mattais88> "Cheating? We've dismissed that notion"
[3:46:18] <peachy996> There is a shot of the interior of the mako. It's in the TV commercial
[3:46:19] <+dirtsniffurperson> didn't you know
[3:46:20] <%QueequegTheater> Mako the true best girl
[3:46:25] <Samurai_Tchan> I wish hacking could be that simple
[3:46:31] <%aWanderingKaivo> Man I forgot about that
[3:46:36] <%Bees359> !uptime
[3:46:36] <@Moobot> @Bees359 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 46m.
[3:46:40] <Broken_Sonex> Cheaters never prosper - pfffffff, of course they do.
[3:46:43] <otakon17> The Mako is dependable, tough and agile
[3:46:47] <+trackles_64> @slingplaysgames  but your cheating yourself
[3:46:56] <%ingman112> I honestly that the falling meteor effect was Zangief panting
[3:46:57] <+Kindan55> Someone has got to tell all those minors just to hack the rocks
[3:46:57] <+EvilErickan> hows the mako handling?
[3:46:59] <stiffybiro> cheating gives you irl renegade points not because it’s space racist, but because you’re not being a narc
[3:47:04] <Samurai_Tchan> WOW ,shooting stars
[3:47:04] <%derpy_platypus> Dead from the start
[3:47:05] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:47:10] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> they sent it out to die
[3:47:11] <aiutare47> It being shit?
[3:47:11] <Gorshum> I'm so ready for Strive.
[3:47:13] <Pookiedaexzile> That they even did anythign at all
[3:47:13] <SaltyAzteca> Smell of GG too strong
[3:47:15] <otakon17> I see Pat is just using the brute force technique
[3:47:20] <%kewlmyc> One is free with PS+ though. It'll have that going for it.
[3:47:26] <Profmcstevie> Imagine being the weaker fighter online next to CHAD THUNDERCOCK ROLLBACKUN
[3:47:27] <SlingPlaysGames> che
[3:47:28] <+trackles_64> hacking corpses
[3:47:30] <%peanutdot007> So what you're saying is no one likes Virtue Fighter and we shouldn't make more-CEO Man
[3:47:32] <%maenos2> hack the mummy
[3:47:35] <+Kindan55> and then they'll say nobody wants to play it NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:47:38] <Pookiedaexzile> HackCorpse
[3:47:43] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> "I guess it was nothing"
[3:47:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> im worried it will be a Capcom/Darkstalkers thing all over again, because they publicly said they're using VF5US to test whether we'll get VF6
[3:47:46] <+dirtsniffurperson> i forgot to check out what racist netcode was all about........
[3:47:50] <%mike2hands> Shattered your expectation
[3:47:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Who wants to work on my new indie Title CorpseHacker
[3:47:59] <%DianaTheAscian> I hope strive does well
[3:48:03] <ape_hawk> "shepard, should we take the body with us to return it to its people?" "nah, thats the warcrimes race, let it rot"
[3:48:08] <otakon17> wait
[3:48:13] <retrosadness> im over 30 hours into my me1 playthrough and i just found out the mako has forward boosters i wanna die
[3:48:14] <otakon17> do you HACK corpses or hack corpses?
[3:48:19] <%justcallmebobplease> MonHun added animal hats for the pets - which notion do you like better, your MonHun Elmo wearing a Zangief faced hood, or your MonHun Zangief wearing an Elmo faced hood?  Who should be eating whose face?
[3:48:27] <viewtifulr> i got burgers
[3:48:29] <SlingPlaysGames> I cant cheat myself by winning. no matter what shame a cheating win brings will not out weigh the thrill of winning
[3:48:31] <%BigCoffee> how

[4:01:26] <$SGrim> Sell as soon as something better comes along
[4:01:29] <AngryAsian5> I usually sell everything below a certain level
[4:01:33] <%bread_assassin> You have an item cap of 300, so once you get close to that, sell @PatStaresAt
[4:01:38] <Dfreddy8> there is a limit
[4:01:42] <NeroInfinite> You can convert it to omni coom
[4:01:42] <otakon17> Break down anything under IV into Omni-Gel, sell V and above you're not using/don't need. IV and lower is not worth the credits
[4:01:47] <Jaysky> Drowning in garbage is an awful way to go
[4:01:47] <peachy996> I mean you're going to Feros, you should probably stop drowning in garbage

[4:02:43] <Pookiedaexzile> You*
[4:02:47] <Giztech> i find it odd that this future still requires you to have finished quests handed in person
[4:02:54] <+trackles_64> missed the  Bane dialouge
[4:02:56] <%JoshManVGH> If you have enough Omni Gel Tali can take a break
[4:03:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Wrex looks so cool
[4:03:05] <+TheyTookMyBeard> I love the goofy hand motions in these games
[4:03:09] <Jaysky> Dammit.
[4:03:11] <Dfreddy8> WHO COULD IT BE?????
[4:03:12] <otakon17> it gives you an excuse to check for new gear at the Citadel and find new quests
[4:03:13] <AthenaAegis> Soooo, they were too dumb too live basically
[4:03:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aw gee whoever did that sure seems scummy

[4:03:46] <+HanbaobaoZaiNar> running. bald. out of breath. xo pressly. the helm!
[4:03:46] <peachy996> I wonder if this guy will look to the right and walk away?
[4:03:49] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt Pat returns to the citadel to say EVERYONE IS DEAD
[4:03:51] <James_Quivers> Half of shepards job is just telling others their family is dead
[4:03:53] <Pookiedaexzile> He ded
[4:03:56] <geassguy360> yeah they need to extend the sprint
[4:04:03] <+ReiDuran> holy fuck I forgot about Bioware Face
[4:04:03] <Dfreddy8> The animations are just recycled through all 3 games
[4:04:05] <%aWanderingKaivo> how many people do you need to report deaths to
[4:04:10] <Jaysky> Everyone 8 find turns up dead
[4:04:10] <peachy996> YEAH

[4:04:24] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL
[4:04:26] <peachy996> That's how you always leave a conversation
[4:04:29] <otakon17> just VANISHED into thin air
[4:04:29] <morningmoondude> Parried at Frame 0
[4:04:30] <%miguelrod777> he exposed pat
[4:04:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait you can actually sprint in hubs now???
[4:04:38] <viewtifulr> it was shepards right
[4:04:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> fake?
[4:04:43] <%AllenDeadman> I know right?
[4:04:45] <otakon17> wait really?
[4:04:48] <James_Quivers> the JANK is too high
[4:04:51] <otakon17> fake video game, Pat explain
[4:04:52] <geassguy360> yeah but only for lik 5 seconds
[4:04:56] <+ReiDuran> The universe of 1 is way better than 2.
[4:04:57] <%AncelDeLambert> anything outside of the main quest is REALLY jank
[4:04:58] <otakon17> the jank is not THAT high
[4:04:59] <%MrBorisMakarov> i never noticed the elevator music LUL
[4:05:00] <%derpy_platypus> You mean the shady club owner named FIST was a mob boss?
[4:05:00] <%sniffy77> aww Tali was dancin
[4:05:02] <akitanito> basic?
[4:05:02] <otakon17> it's not ELEX high
[4:05:04] <Profmcstevie> It works just enough to maintain the illusion but also not really
[4:05:04] <CSeriesJTYPE> a lot of asset/animation reuse
[4:05:05] <Mattais88> 1 feels like a kickstarter game, and 2 the one they made with all the 1 money
[4:05:06] <+SargentToughie> like a video game you'd see somebody play in a movie
[4:05:07] <gralho> are ME 1 and 3 That different is legendary?
[4:05:10] <%Monkeyweed21> it feels like the game you would see people play in the background of a 2008 movie
[4:05:11] <$Faustgesicht> Honestly fucking love the elevator music
[4:05:12] <Latija> it looks like a game you'd see on a tv in a movie
[4:05:15] <otakon17> almost tech demo-y?
[4:05:15] <Kain5707> butter
[4:05:15] <akitanito> so euro-jank
[4:05:17] <+FierceDeityGabe> Like the witcher
[4:05:21] <xcompleasedad> Every side quest is one of three EXACT flavors
[4:05:21] <nuane> like a what
[4:05:23] <%walternatorz> like a bag of sand?
[4:05:25] <wolverinewaswrong> Each mission is like an episode tbh
[4:05:26] <%AllenDeadman> god I hate the camera shake when he runs...
[4:05:26] <+trackles_64> its the EA special treatment
[4:05:27] <otakon17> it's structured better I think is what you mean
[4:05:27] <Profmcstevie> You can feel the programming and game logic working as you play
[4:05:29] <+ReiDuran> Thermal clips.
[4:05:30] <ogobmt0619> me1 is 3 animations in a trenchcoat
[4:05:31] <Broken_Sonex> Like a boobie?
[4:05:31] <%bugz_munny> i just came back but yeah boobs are cool
[4:05:34] <peachy996> ME2 is more natural, ME1 is more stiff
[4:05:35] <geassguy360> yeah 1 is just a bit off
[4:05:35] <%dekkitout> Like a boob or a bloob?
[4:05:36] <%JoshManVGH> 2 is fine tuned to what style they wanted to go for.
[4:05:37] <akitanito> like witcher 1 to 3?
[4:05:37] <Jaysky> Stiff?
[4:05:38] <gralho> m1 feels like a mmo tbh
[4:05:41] <Dfreddy8> Also can only see your bar with weapons out
[4:05:42] <otakon17> boobs <3
[4:05:45] <%MidnightBurst12> I think I understand?
[4:05:45] <James_Quivers> One got the lore and world set up well, but Two got the vibe and feel way better
[4:05:45] <%walternatorz> oh wait, did you say "booby" or "movie"?
[4:05:46] <Pookiedaexzile> MAss Effect 2 is the Blade 2 of Mass Effect
[4:05:48] <CSeriesJTYPE> Its like every time Geralt kneels down to pick something up in the Witcher 3 but its always the same exact animation and then it cuts to black cause they didnt animate anything else
[4:05:50] <+Kindan55> she's on another planet.
[4:05:52] <+trackles_64> lol
[4:05:53] <peachy996> Blake is waiting for you in a different planet
[4:05:53] <Pookiedaexzile> It fucks the universe but its better
[4:05:55] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt its the game someone is playing in the background during a movie or TV show
[4:05:55] <akitanito> stiff sounds right
[4:05:55] <Jaysky> 2 is my favorite in play
[4:05:57] <%derpy_platypus> the narrative teet of Mass Effect is hard to describe
[4:05:58] <+Shubreaker> like it's got heft
[4:05:59] <+Kindan55> where you can gank her
[4:06:02] <%Varlinator> Never thought of it like that. Sure, Mass Effect 2 is a real nice Titty
[4:06:02] <geassguy360> ME1 is waaay more playable than Witcher 1 lol
[4:06:05] <%bugz_munny> Y E S
[4:06:10] <%AllenDeadman> FUCK
[4:06:12] <%AncelDeLambert> that is really on point
[4:06:16] <%templar010> Shit thats perfect
[4:06:17] <%AllenDeadman> WHY DOES THAT WORK?
[4:06:17] <+mcjimbles> Well to be fair I think KOTOR feels off too when playing movement wise
[4:06:17] <otakon17> it's when the series started to come into it's own
[4:06:23] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:06:25] <%bugz_munny> SOME MOTHERFUCKAS ALWAYS TRYIN TO ICESKATE UPHILL
[4:06:25] <peachy996> ME3 is the Blade Trinity
[4:06:29] <%MrBorisMakarov> DAMN
[4:06:29] <%AncelDeLambert> it's just Blade
[4:06:30] <iosephe> holy shit
[4:06:30] <+Ropcord> 🤔
[4:06:32] <akitanito> so shep was high all the time?
[4:06:33] <James_Quivers> ME2 is the Terminator 2 of videos games
[4:06:35] <otakon17> Blade 1: good but a bit janky
[4:06:37] <%dekkitout> It's many trilogies though
[4:06:38] <%AllenDeadman> huh
[4:06:38] <%templar010> NotLikeThis my mind
[4:06:41] <BinaryShuffle> stripHmm
[4:06:41] <otakon17> Blade 2: like, almost perfect
[4:06:42] <+trackles_64> but they ne er made a blade 4
[4:06:44] <%DakotaMacDoodle> It rymes
[4:06:45] <geassguy360> lol no way
[4:06:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Blade 1 was sloppy but had a lot of potentional
[4:06:48] <%MrBorisMakarov> what's that make Andromeda
[4:06:49] <ape_hawk> blade 3 had the tamest version of ryan reynolds and it sucks because of it
[4:06:49] <DatAsuna> shepard went to jail for not paying taxes
[4:06:49] <+ReiDuran> WHO'S THE TRIPLE H WITH THE VAMPIRE POMERANIAN OF MASS EFFECT 3
[4:06:51] <otakon17> Blade 3: enjoyable but loses steam
[4:06:53] <peachy996> When Liara cries and Javik just tells her USE IT
[4:06:55] <+logus313> Who would be Triple H?
[4:06:57] <%Varlinator> @James_Quivers Damn, beat me to it
[4:06:58] <%bugz_munny> shut up
[4:06:58] <geassguy360> ME3 is waaay better than trinity what u smokin

[4:15:08] <ape_hawk> do you think conrad tells his wife to put on a Shepard mask and a strapon and tell her to just go to town on him?
[4:15:10] <%walternatorz> Does he even have a wife?
[4:15:10] <%Deft_Thought> This scene would play better if Conrad didn't look like he was 50 years old
[4:15:10] <%maenos2> I always kinda doubted his wife ever existed
[4:15:11] <%justcallmebobplease> He legit can't see any person's importance besides his own.
[4:15:11] <%Agami23> the lighting on his chin makes him look like a puppet with a fucked up jaw
[4:15:15] <%aWanderingKaivo> @peachy996 it looks like his chin was sandpapered
[4:15:16] <thetruenicster> Man, everyone just LOVES bringing up that Extremely Traumatic Event from your past

[4:16:46] <slix3431> Bitch ass Krogan

[4:16:59] <wasdsf> bane?
[4:16:59] <viewtifulr> What a krogan Kappa
[4:16:59] <$Ziegsy> the ff7 update is live apparently
[4:17:01] <+ratchetex> that worked?
[4:17:04] <$SGrim> WHERE'S BANE!
[4:17:05] <+Ropcord> remember, it's actually Dr. Conrad Verner
[4:17:05] <%aWanderingKaivo> the citadel just has this ONE medical clinic
[4:17:06] <dero45> that krogan wasnt bout that life
[4:17:07] <Parapattern> I'll just go now
[4:17:07] <hat_under_bread> Banes?

[4:17:08] <+D00msDayDan> Bane?
[4:17:10] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat, the Krogan are not intimidated by french
[4:17:11] <%maenos2> hes a big guy
[4:17:12] <+Shubreaker> oh i don't like being not treated
[4:17:13] <AngryAsian5> That dude wussed out quick LUL
[4:17:15] <$SGrim> IS RACHEL BANE?
[4:17:16] <peachy996> I hate this Banes sidequest it loops in on itself
[4:17:19] <%dekkitout> Can we not escape Bane
[4:17:19] <%ingman112> Why is French Shepard happening
[4:17:19] <%peanutdot007> Put on the mask etc.
[4:17:24] <Parapattern> How deep does the Bane hole go?!
[4:17:24] <%X2Eliah> ITS ALL BANES
[4:17:27] <Dfreddy8> WHERE'S SCARECROW
[4:17:28] <aiutare47> That is super weak, that was a response to a renegade line and the paragon had to have been added later
[4:17:33] <nuane> so isn't the doctor screwed now?
[4:17:34] <TourettesPlays> for some reason the Banes subquest goes on for a while even tho it doesnt matter at all
[4:17:37] <iosephe> WHY DOES HE WEAR THE MASK?
[4:17:40] <ape_hawk> i mean, regular shepard is already Canadian
[4:17:40] <CSeriesJTYPE> Normandie
[4:17:42] <%emperordread> why does man shep's voice so familiar? Is he Riker from TNG or something?
[4:17:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Because look at him
[4:17:44] <xcompleasedad> David Cage is cursing you
[4:17:44] <%derpy_platypus> glad they gave Shepard robo-lungs in ME 2

[4:17:45] <+sermittens> The krogan are french
[4:17:45] <$SGrim> true
[4:17:46] <Jonny_Uppercut> Yeah but the Brits conquered Normandy
[4:17:47] <James_Quivers> French people probably eat Krogan, it makes snese
[4:17:48] <ape_hawk> you can hear it whenever he says "again"
[4:17:49] <peachy996> You ask everyone about Banes and you never get a clear answer where to go and what to do
[4:17:51] <%bugz_munny> why isnt it happening more
[4:17:51] <+Punchasaur> Is Ashley bane
[4:17:52] <Dunmarkh> because you made yourself in the character creator fr*nchie
[4:17:53] <%MidnightBurst12> Could be english
[4:17:54] <morningmoondude> Le bang, d'accord?

[4:26:18] <ape_hawk> tali and wrex are frenemies and they LOVE it
[4:26:18] <%emperordread> Lady No CHill
[4:26:19] <Luckster1234> "yeah it was pretty cool"
[4:26:19] <Dunmarkh> PURPLE ASHLEY AT IT AGAIN
[4:26:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> BRUH
[4:26:21] <%TheFabledAble> Krogan "WE GOT SOME GOOD HITS IN THOUGH"
[4:26:22] <+MightyDuckShoes> Wrex is a Krogan badass
[4:26:23] <wolverinewaswrong> at least wrex acknowledges that was dumb
[4:26:24] <zenith0111> Well I mean its true
[4:26:24] <%MisterRockett> I mean they do
[4:26:29] <Jaysky> Awkward
[4:26:37] <%Chichen> Shepard.
[4:26:37] <%castlerock42> Well, yeah, pat. He thinks the Krogan are idiots.
[4:26:38] <akitanito> geth did nothing wrong
[4:26:39] <Mattais88> Fracking Toasters
[4:26:40] <%dekkitout> I don't...
[4:26:40] <HeroToxiko> Did talis race not do a whole genocide or nh
[4:26:43] <JetpackMcQuack> Be like wrex
[4:26:43] <%derpy_platypus> yeah genocide harder
[4:26:45] <+mcjimbles> Joking about effectively genocide lol never change mass effect species
[4:26:45] <%emperordread> Krogans did nothing wrong
[4:26:47] <%QueequegTheater> Wrex is just like "Yeah fair enough"
[4:26:47] <+RoByte2> To be fair, the Krogan did save the galaxy before they decided to kick things off
[4:26:50] <Pookiedaexzile> That was the perfect "Yeah bitch I know I fucked up, but I'm growing"
[4:26:53] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The quarians learned nothing. This is a fact of the games
[4:26:54] <HeroToxiko> LUL
[4:26:56] <%Monkeyweed21> it takes a LONG time for Tali to turn around on the Geth
[4:26:57] <%dekkitout> Guess it was Shep who learned the lesson(?)
[4:26:57] <viewtifulr> imagine the krogen being the calm one in that situation
[4:27:00] <%walternatorz> who's currently fighting toasters? curious, hmm?
[4:27:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> quarians the gamer race
[4:27:04] <+Ropcord> @HeroToxiko they tried and they got their asses kicked into space
[4:27:09] <+ratchetex> they tried to kill all the geth and then got their asses handed to them
[4:27:11] <%AncelDeLambert> to do genocide you have to have genes, bam loophole
[4:27:12] <peachy996> Did you know there was cut content between Mordin and Grunt?
[4:27:13] <%TheFabledAble> @HeroToxiko technically the failed to do the genocide but they tried and got booted off their planet by the robots they tried to genocide
[4:27:13] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Zionist Tali loves preemptive strikes
[4:27:19] <+ratchetex> they aslo made the geth
[4:27:20] <+MightyDuckShoes> It's more like Wrex finds value in learning from the past instead of charging onwards blind like Tali.
[4:27:21] <$SGrim> Tau? SMOrc
[4:27:22] <ape_hawk> fuck you, udina
[4:27:24] <HeroToxiko> @Monkeyweed21 facts
[4:27:25] <$hattrick61> "It wasn't genocide, BUT IF IT WAS THEY DESERVED IT." Didn't know tali was turkish
[4:27:32] <+Kindan55> @ravioli_ronin Oh no...
[4:27:33] <peachy996> The same type of argument situation like with Jack/Miranda and Tali/Legion
[4:27:34] <thetruenicster> #FuckUdina
[4:27:34] <akitanito> *exit stage left*
[4:27:37] <%Tman451> i love that walking away animation
[4:27:38] <ape_hawk> banes?
[4:27:39] <+trackles_64> so do renegade got it
[4:27:41] <BinaryShuffle> BANE!?
[4:27:43] <$Wurmspawn> Well, I don't think the Krogan see the Genophage as, "lesson learned" they talk about it all the time because they see it is an unjust punishment that needs to be resolved but never will.
[4:27:45] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko lol, nice.
[4:27:46] <aiutare47> @MightyDuckShoes Wrex is a lot older than Tali right?
[4:27:48] <Pookiedaexzile> We will never put Udina on the concil
[4:27:49] <%TheFabledAble> @hattrick61 or israeli or chinese or

[4:28:38] <%pyurient> I bet he vented
[4:28:38] <peachy996> Too bad Kahoku left
[4:28:41] <+MightyDuckShoes> @aiutare47 Oh definitely.  Wrex is old and war weary. Tali is young peppy and gung-ho with Quarian patriotism.
[4:28:43] <Drunkengen> yes

[4:29:00] <Mattais88> CapAdmirBassador
[4:29:05] <+Kindan55> This mission is bugged pat
[4:29:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> Tali is still drinking the Quoolaid
[4:29:07] <$Wurmspawn> @MightyDuckShoes Based on racial age, most likely, but I'm not sure about the specific timeline between the two. I think Quarians have a human-like nature lifespan while Krogan can live at least a couple centuries if they don't die in battle.
[4:29:07] <geassguy360> and the Arbiter
[4:29:11] <+Kindan55> feels cut.
[4:29:12] <+Ropcord> he has the same voice actor as Vice President Keith David
[4:29:13] <peachy996> I must have ran in circles trying to figure it out
[4:29:19] <+Alopekis> Even if you could tall to Kahoku, he basically just tells you that Banes is dead. I think it's part of a Quest that was cut.
[4:29:20] <%QueequegTheater> Oh no, Kotaku is cancelled
[4:29:22] <%QueequegTheater> Kappa
[4:29:24] <James_Quivers> He committed Kuhoku

[4:32:12] <%Dehlome> psaGib
[4:32:12] <+mcjimbles> You need super high charm for Helena

[4:32:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> wait Cerberus was ALLIANCE BLACK OPS
[4:32:42] <Dfreddy8> WHO
[4:32:43] <%walternatorz> Cerberus sounds like a stand up organization.
[4:32:43] <AmuserName> BIG BADDIES
[4:32:43] <peachy996> "Can you tell me about Banes real quick?"
[4:32:44] <DatAsuna> MONTHS

[4:32:50] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat the illusive mans name is jack harper
[4:32:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Space CIA
[4:32:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Cerberus did nothing wrong :3
[4:32:53] <%dekkitout> That sounds pretty bad...
[4:32:54] <televisedrevolting> Who's that? Sounds irrelevant and like it won't come up again.
[4:32:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Miranda?
[4:33:00] <ape_hawk> what if cerberus was making soldiers with three heads lol
[4:33:00] <RedPlasticCup> Cerberus???
[4:33:00] <%bread_assassin> Do any of the side novels resolve the whole Armistan Banes plot?
[4:33:01] <+trackles_64> this name might be important in the future
[4:33:04] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Wait they were alliance?
[4:33:06] <%TheFabledAble> no wonder the humans on your crew dont trust them for shit
[4:33:07] <Yakobro> left
[4:33:10] <JetpackMcQuack> Just another band of rogues
[4:33:11] <+Kindan55> Remember when Miranda justifies these experiments in 2?
[4:33:13] <ape_hawk> KAHOKU IS DEAD
[4:33:15] <$LetsBeBadAtVideoGames> They sound illusive
[4:33:15] <%Dehlome> they tried to make super soliders and ended up just making a hot girl?
[4:33:17] <%derpy_platypus> psaBig DEAD
[4:33:19] <Broken_Sonex> I FORGOT CERBERUS USED TO BE ALLIANCE
[4:33:24] <%cvp5127> f
[4:33:24] <+ratchetex> @Kindan55 yes
[4:33:25] <%dekkitout> I can now see the sudden benefit of a Spectre
[4:33:26] <ScreamLord> The Illusive Man's real name was Jack Harper. Which has to be a Two and a Half Men reference because Charlie Sheen played a Harper
[4:33:29] <+pupil31> STRAYA D:
[4:33:34] <yficaptions> deady-dead dead
[4:33:34] <James_Quivers> The genetical perfect claps of Mirandas cheeks
[4:33:49] <peachy996> Could also have been that other chick from Cerberus
[4:33:50] <Broken_Sonex> STRAYA TOO DUMMY THICC M8
[4:33:50] <%dekkitout> Space Australia is in Mass Effect D:
[4:33:52] <+mcjimbles> It never sat right with me how nonchalant shephard can be about Cerberus at key points in me2 after this quest
[4:33:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Genetical Engineered PAWGS
[4:33:54] <+Kindan55> Miranda justifies this by saying 'no u' in 2.
[4:33:54] <peachy996> Forget her name
[4:33:56] <+Shubreaker> is this the dragon age planet
[4:33:59] <%Ravioli_Ronin> I didn’t even know they were alliance; ME2 just made it sound like a well-funded Space-Klan
[4:34:10] <Reverend_Godshyne> Kahoku felt the ass effect
[4:34:13] <%YakumoYomi> LUL
[4:34:14] <TheAnimeTiger> @Dehlome they succeded

[4:34:31] <%Hitman0257> Miranda is the Ashley of ME2
[4:34:40] <+Alopekis> I always hate how awkward the Sole Survivor background makes ME2 feel.
[4:34:41] <%X2Eliah> Btw the "debris" objects on the map onl have random generater gear loot, nothing else
[4:34:42] <%CatastropheCorvid> Iggy Azalea is discount Iggy Azalea.
[4:34:42] <+Shubreaker> Iggy Azalea is Discount Miranda
[4:34:43] <%Dehlome> hack the minerals
[4:34:45] <%Monkeyweed21> OH NO SHEPHARD ITS A BLACK GUY WITH NO PERSONALITY TRAITS HELP ME
[4:34:48] <%dekkitout> Whacchu gonna do when the Space-PAWGs come after you?! I'd lay down
[4:34:48] <peachy996> Miranda is nowhere near as bad as Ashley
[4:34:50] <%ingman112> Miranda’s justification is “Every single species has had one of these groups. STG, commandos, and now the Spectres. We’re just humanity’s version”
[4:34:54] <karl_rex> When Shifty Cow?
[4:34:56] <+Kindan55> Miranda is just interesting Ashley
[4:34:56] <peachy996> Miranda doesn't hate aliens

[4:36:32] <%saadi90> Some science lady

[4:36:40] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt He's the Black Guy. And that's it.
[4:36:41] <%Maids4lyfe> THAT'S NOT VERY PARAGON OF JACOB
[4:36:42] <$hattrick61> THE BLACK GUY CHEATS ON YOU WHILE YOU'RE IN PRISON.
[4:36:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Jacob turns Mass Effect into Maury
[4:36:42] <+Alopekis> imagine getting cheated on by an NPC
[4:36:44] <James_Quivers> You get to slap the shit out of him for it in the Citadel DLC
[4:36:46] <Dabrikishaw> Jacob was supposed to be bisexial
[4:36:46] <$LetsBeBadAtVideoGames> NO WAY
[4:36:48] <%maenos2> he is the ONLY love interest to cheat.  classy.
[4:36:51] <Reverend_Godshyne> They shit on all the ME2 romances
[4:36:52] <%Ranryu692> why's the one black guy gotta be the one that cheats?
[4:36:53] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> And Kasumi is SUPER into him
[4:36:53] <sio_pao2001> they were on break
[4:36:55] <+tetraes> so the only black crew member cheats on you lol?
[4:36:59] <ioci2112> femshep gets shafted hard with romances, jacob cheats, thane dies, kaidan just sucks balls, only garrus is worth it
[4:37:01] <DatAsuna> NHL slapshit him
[4:37:04] <$Futurecity10> Kasumi loves Jacobs ass
[4:37:08] <$SGrim> Mod dialog to say that he isn't any better than his father LUL
[4:37:08] <$Faustgesicht> His father is a one-off villain and is  legitimately more interesting than his son
[4:37:10] <%Mekhet09> It still sucks.
[4:37:13] <DatAsuna> Thane gets a funeral in citadel
[4:37:15] <MasterTonberry23> the citadel was the best dlc ever
[4:37:24] <+trackles_64> they did citadel cause fans complained complained out the ending.
[4:37:24] <ape_hawk> the beginning of ME3 shouldve been some of your me1+2 buddies breaking you out of earth jail
[4:37:30] <karl_rex> Use a save editor
[4:37:31] <James_Quivers> The Citadel DLC is a marvel, there's so mucha nd it's all great
[4:37:31] <DatAsuna> And then if you romanced him femshep just watches video letters from him and cries lol
[4:37:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Dlc for the finale 4Head
[4:37:32] <RushUnplugged> the black guy cheats on you AND his dad ran away from home, it's hilarious how bad they swerved INTO the stereotypes
[4:37:34] <morningmoondude> imagine being the 1 Jacob stan out there and having your character fuck him only to be told you're a cuck for liking Jacob
[4:37:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Wrex and Grunt team up its the best
[4:37:36] <geassguy360> Citadel works great as an epilogue after the end, theres even mods that implement it like that
[4:37:38] <DatAsuna> whoo party dlc
[4:37:39] <%Retinolgaming> Save editor is your friend pat
[4:37:41] <%ingman112> Jacob should have been James. Vega and James in 3 should have been replaced by a lunatic batarian
[4:37:44] <%Canti510> FEMSHEP GETS TO TANGO WITH GARRUS IN CITADEL
[4:37:45] <%Ravioli_Ronin> It’s still so fucking out of place
[4:37:48] <%X2Eliah> Honestly me3 with all of the dlc is pretty decent right no
[4:37:57] <+pupil31> LETS GOO
[4:37:59] <%AllenDeadman> but cheating tho
[4:38:00] <$Futurecity10> It wouldnt surprise me if Jacob knew how to play bass
[4:38:04] <%aWanderingKaivo> the response to the Citadel DLC really shows how well liked the characters were though for real
[4:38:04] <peachy996> But what if I lied
[4:38:05] <wolverinewaswrong> Jacob should have been Kai Leng
[4:38:09] <RetributionP> spoilblers everywhere
[4:38:11] <GustauveVIII> is femship with liara gay or does it count since gender is not a thing for asari?
[4:38:11] <DatAsuna> the silenced pistol in citadel is the bomb
[4:38:19] <karl_rex> You can one night stand Javik
[4:38:21] <%derpy_platypus> space building #2
[4:38:22] <James_Quivers> OH NOOOOOOOOOO
[4:38:23] <%saadi90> Citadel DLC is incredible
[4:38:23] <MasterTonberry23> hey its the prefab building
[4:38:24] <%maenos2> god fuck Kai lemg
[4:38:24] <Reverend_Godshyne> the copy/paste facility
[4:38:27] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[4:38:28] <RushUnplugged> @GustauveVIII it's the right thing to do
[4:38:29] <srv4254> kai lang is nothing too
[4:38:30] <%Hitman0257> Did you ever play the Arrival DLC for ME2
[4:38:30] <%QueequegTheater> Asari are female
[4:38:31] <xcompleasedad> @wolverinewaswrong YO
[4:38:31] <%Monkeyweed21> remember when you missed out on the Killers motivation in Disco Elysium
[4:38:32] <+trackles_64> Citadel is basically fan fiction
[4:38:33] <+samiscoolbro> Good
[4:38:34] <%Taisuru> When dog
[4:38:34] <akitanito> it's all the same
[4:38:35] <aiutare47> ME3 has some really cool concepts and moments, and the weapons are much better, but the rest is just kind eeehhhh
[4:38:36] <James_Quivers> Good, you opened this message
[4:38:37] <buhbuhboat> Pat has erased ME3 from his memory#
[4:38:39] <%afronooch> lets stop talking about kai leng
[4:38:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Quit dropping names he doesn't know
[4:38:39] <beefcakemanthrob> hahaha no, kai leng shouldn't exist
[4:38:40] <%Monkeyweed21> KAI LENG IS THE WORST
[4:38:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck Kai Lenng
[4:38:41] <xcompleasedad> @wolverinewaswrong That's fucking HYPE
[4:38:41] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Kai Lang is just the worst
[4:38:42] <tanarath> crazy asian dude who is auged to hell
[4:38:43] <wolverinewaswrong> Should have been the main cerberus bad guy instead of that other dude in 3 I guess
[4:38:43] <+D00msDayDan> if you use a save editor you can have legion for all of ME2 instead of just the final stretch
[4:38:44] <%derpy_platypus> jumpscare
[4:38:44] <Mattais88> Oh God, Pat dosn't know Kai Leng since he never played 3...
[4:38:44] <RedPlasticCup> AUGH
[4:38:46] <DatAsuna> ignore the guns on her
[4:38:46] <geassguy360> Mst pick renegade options when dealing with clone-shep
[4:38:51] <peachy996> "Anybody-OHHHH"
[4:38:56] <Dabrikishaw> Jacob COULD have been interesting, but he's just Space Black Guy with al the stereotyping that intails
[4:38:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Justice
[4:38:57] <%X2Eliah> @buhbuhboat Hes never played it
[4:38:59] <$Ziegsy> she HAS A GUN
[4:39:03] <wolverinewaswrong> Oh no Pat doesn't know Kai Leng

[4:39:08] <$Wurmspawn> ME3 spoilers. Remember Chat, Pat knows about end game stuff in ME3 but he hasn't played past the Mars mission.

[4:42:53] <derpy_platypus> now you gotta 100% all 3 games
[4:42:57] <buhbuhboat> they're attacked to the conrad verner quest as well
[4:42:57] <peachy996> Conrad Verner in 3 is ridiculous
[4:43:00] <AthenaAegis> Even Elmo can't believe it
[4:43:00] <%Canti510> You need Conrad Verner + Asari Writing + Elkoss License + Jenna alive for it to REALLY PAY OFF
[4:43:01] <%Varlinator> It's true. I only learned about that like a week ago
[4:43:02] <MasterTonberry23> so are we just in full on backseat/spoilers mode? that where we are chat?
[4:43:04] <Mr_Taters > A shocking amount of small stuff in 1 skip 2 and show up 3
[4:43:04] <morningmoondude> ME3 is great with the callbacks. That's how bad the ending is that nobody talked about it.
[4:43:06] <+mcjimbles> Yes you need a specific vendor license too I forget which one
[4:43:07] <dero45> they probably forgot about them
[4:43:07] <%Monkeyweed21> THERES SOME WILD CARRYOVER BETWEEN GAMES
[4:43:09] <DatAsuna> tbf it comes up here in a very minor way
[4:43:11] <%X2Eliah> 3 brings up a lot of these small things, in small ways
[4:43:13] <DatAsuna> start minor end minor
[4:43:15] <Samurai_Tchan> His robocop head turn shows what he feels
[4:43:15] <beefcakemanthrob> buy all of the licenses too
[4:43:20] <geassguy360> 3 is pretty good most of the time, it gets more shit than it deserves, outside the ending ofc.
[4:43:23] <James_Quivers> Conrad in 3 is the 'Man, ME1 was weird, huh" character
[4:43:28] <Jaysky> @MasterTonberry23 We've been yes. Pat knows about everything
[4:43:29] <%GarbageNirvana> make sure you get all the collectibles you can so you can drink the green Kool-Aid
[4:43:30] <+Shubreaker> pat's played all of these anyway
[4:43:30] <%dekkitout> Decryptin' aint easy
[4:43:30] <%mike2hands> GRAMPA BABY
[4:43:31] <Pookiedaexzile> "We're disbanded so I guess you can robb us?"
[4:43:45] <morningmoondude> if the ending was mediocre, everyone would say "yeah, 3 isn't as good as 2, BUT THE CALLBACKS THO"
[4:43:47] <DatAsuna> me3 allows you to finally screw over the man looking for that refund too
[4:43:48] <%dankjerri> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[4:43:48] <%X2Eliah> @Shubreaker He hasn't played 3
[4:43:48] <peachy996> Outside of the ending, Cerberus, Kai Leng, Starchild, Reaper motivations
[4:43:51] <Jaysky> @geassguy360 It's the last 10 minutes people mostly harp on and that their choices don't matter as much as advertised.
[4:43:53] <wolverinewaswrong> Oh new ship!
[4:43:54] <%Monkeyweed21> 3 is really good except for Kai Leng and the ending
[4:43:56] <%emperordread> emperordread subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! Playing series for first time with legendary edition. Accidentilly got to point of no return before being able to hand in lots of sidequests. Have I goosed my playthrough?
[4:43:57] <+Kindan55> WAIT THEY ARE??
[4:43:59] <+Kindan55> How?
[4:44:00] <aiutare47> @Jaysky Pat said "I dont know who that is?" to Kai
[4:44:01] <+trackles_64> why Ashely never joined Cerberus?
[4:44:03] <dero45> word fuk em than
[4:44:03] <tanarath> Never ever!
[4:44:06] <wolverinewaswrong> it means you left a chest unopened
[4:44:07] <MasterTonberry23> Man Cerberus is awful! We'll never work for or with them!
[4:44:07] <murdocismyhero> ME2 is the best one cause it has fish
[4:44:08] <ioci2112> I'll totally never work with them
[4:44:11] <%byuniart> Where Ashley been?
[4:44:12] <%AllenDeadman> 3 is good until it isn't
[4:44:12] <%maenos2> watAsmile
[4:44:12] <peachy996> All your squadmates from 2 not being in 3
[4:44:13] <%Monkeyweed21> it always does this
[4:44:15] <Pookiedaexzile> But Genetically engineered ass
[4:44:16] <+mcjimbles> @geassguy360 I agree for the most part 3 stumbles at then ending but the journey is great
[4:44:16] <Broken_Sonex> I WILL NEVER FORGIVE THEM NOR WORK WITH THEM NOPE
[4:44:17] <tanarath> @kindan55 weapons tests
[4:44:17] <%derpy_platypus> "I'll never work for Cerberus"-Shepard
[4:44:19] <%byuniart> God
[4:44:19] <%dekkitout> Would never forgive them, no matter how fine their assess might be! psaFist
[4:44:19] <$Wurmspawn> No forgiveness. Never. No way they could EVER do ANYTHING that would make me sympathetic.
[4:44:22] <Jaysky> Wait wait wait, Pat hasn't done 3?
[4:44:22] <Samurai_Tchan> Bring justice
[4:44:25] <Jonny_Uppercut> But what of Dude Bro's gonna Dude Bro Vega?
[4:44:27] <geassguy360> Control is best ending, Synthesis doesn't even make sense and screw killing the geth
[4:44:30] <%byuniart> Thane is one hot fish
[4:44:36] <Samurai_Tchan> Galaxy judge
[4:44:38] <tanarath> @kindan55 they attract threasher maws.
[4:44:38] <%ingman112> Pat has not done 3
[4:44:39] <%Monkeyweed21> NOT THE WORST CLUSTER
[4:44:40] <Jaysky> Bull he's talking about the stupid ninja
[4:44:42] <CrypticMochi> There more stuff wrong in 3 than just Kai or the climax
[4:44:43] <buhbuhboat> ME3's plot is kinda stupid but to be fair ME2's main plot is basically filler
[4:44:45] <CorazonFeathers> What they have done is yurusenai Kappa
[4:44:47] <Jaysky> *talked
[4:44:51] <Samurai_Tchan> Galaxy Judge dredd
[4:44:57] <MasterTonberry23> i just realized almost all the squadmates in me1 werent in me2 so you couldnt kill them off before me3
[4:44:58] <%samazonsky> Hey there Pat
[4:44:58] <+Shubreaker> Vega is unironically a fun character
[4:44:59] <$Futurecity10> >works for cerberus >Impregnate all female researchers > Leaves
[4:45:01] <peachy996> Control means you trust Bioware writers with Control. For me Destroy is the only option, sorry Geth
[4:45:01] <%samazonsky> <3
[4:45:04] <%ingman112> Mods do fucking work fixing ME3
[4:45:07] <RetributionP> good Ole fish turburculosus
[4:45:10] <%samazonsky> hey chat <3
[4:45:17] <PirateMike_> @Jonny_Uppercut Im pretty sure vega just accidently fell out of Gears Of War
[4:45:20] <Samurai_Tchan> @Shubreaker the best human
[4:45:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> destroy is the most logical one i think, it's what you've set out to do from the beginning, and leaving them alive runs major risks
[4:45:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Did any one Check the Thanes expiration date before buying it at the store Kappa
[4:45:35] <%dekkitout> @Futurecity10 I guess Cerbs gets their ubermensch tajC
[4:45:40] <wolverinewaswrong> luckily the original version is gone
[4:45:47] <Jonny_Uppercut> @PirateMike_ He doesn't feel angry enough
[4:45:48] <wolverinewaswrong> need an original disk for that
[4:45:49] <$Faustgesicht> Gotta know what, pat?
[4:45:50] <+mcjimbles> I fucking hate Vega actually lol
[4:45:50] <CorazonFeathers> LUL
[4:45:53] <DatAsuna> destroy is the only ethical ending
[4:45:58] <aiutare47> hey this is cow planet right?
[4:46:03] <MasterTonberry23> so does this version of ME3 just have the extended cut by default?
[4:46:03] <dero45> i like 3 great end if not bitter sweet
[4:46:06] <%maenos2> Vega is a good boi
[4:46:08] <+trackles_64> Nah that's earth
[4:46:08] <ScreamLord> The Moss Planet
[4:46:10] <42nfl19> wait modified?
[4:46:16] <+Dreadknight297> nah.
[4:46:16] <Mr_Taters > @Kindan55 If it's the Thresher Maw backstory, the Thresher Maw is attracted to the squad via a device Cerberus was testing
[4:46:16] <$Futurecity10> @DatAsuna You're god damn right it is
[4:46:17] <DatAsuna> @MasterTonberry23 yes
[4:46:22] <Samurai_Tchan> these planets have no birds
[4:46:22] <viewtifulr> these here are cow tools
[4:46:23] <CorazonFeathers> Planet Cow DansGame
[4:46:23] <%Canti510> Shifty Space Cow
[4:46:26] <MasterTonberry23> it looks like the planet is covered in poo
[4:46:27] <%aWanderingKaivo> I just do destroy and headcanon the Geth being killed too as a bluff
[4:46:29] <AngryAsian5> Shifty cow
[4:46:29] <peachy996> I don't remember which planet that is
[4:46:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> bless you
[4:46:32] <42nfl19> What mod is @PatStaresAt referring to?
[4:46:33] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> That's what I call a Paragon sneeze
[4:46:33] <dero45> bless mlady
[4:46:35] <geassguy360> IMO control is what they will go with for ME4, but shep will destroy the reapers after using them anyways and then the catalyst will spit him back out when the galaxy is in danger again.
[4:46:40] <peachy996> I thought that was Elegia with the space monkeys
[4:46:41] <%ingman112> Nah that’s Ontarom I think
[4:46:41] <%Taisuru> psaPorgmo
[4:46:43] <%derpy_platypus> catJAM
[4:46:45] <%QueequegTheater> Vega is great, he's like a dumb CoD character got isekai'ed into ME
[4:46:46] <$Futurecity10> synthesis is fucking bullshit I hate it
[4:46:46] <%maenos2> yeah funky music
[4:46:49] <%TheFabledAble> this fucking music xD
[4:46:50] <+Okashido> Hey Pat, How's it going?
[4:47:03] <DSD24> I love this song
[4:47:03] <peachy996> Man FUCK Synthesis
[4:47:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Shifty lookin cow?
[4:47:11] <Jaysky> @geassguy360 ME4 won't happen and if it does it's not going to be anything like the old games
[4:47:13] <peachy996> Imagine being a Husk and Synthesis happens to you
[4:47:20] <DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater did you watch the movie where he has the big dumb melodrama pushing his face into the dirt while it rains yelling "I'M SORRY"
[4:47:25] <PirateMike_> Pat does the Mako feel any different then the OG ME1?
[4:47:25] <+Okashido> How's the Mako in the updated ME games?
[4:47:28] <AmericanaRed> ADROMEDA FALSHBACKS sbfpPat
[4:47:28] <Samurai_Tchan> skywalker farm
[4:47:36] <$SGrim> Synthesis is like Centrist Moralism in Elysium.
[4:47:38] <CorazonFeathers> You having fun watching the stream, buddy? BegWan
[4:47:39] <%QueequegTheater> no
[4:47:39] <%bravebravesrobin> Elmo looks majestic af
[4:47:45] <MasterTonberry23> after andromeda, and anthem, i honestly have zero confidence that bioware can still do an ME game, sad to say
[4:47:47] <+mcjimbles> @jaysky have you not seen the me4 teaser?
[4:47:49] <$Futurecity10> andromeda sucks because there were the makings of a good game in it
[4:47:52] <Samurai_Tchan> skydusters farm
[4:47:52] <%GinAndRoses> we meet again prefab bunker
[4:47:54] <dero45> @Jaysky they announced 4 back in dec
[4:47:55] <RetributionP> @americanared same
[4:47:55] <DatAsuna> the movie is terrible, I love it
[4:47:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh shit it's this place?
[4:47:58] <morningmoondude> space turtles
[4:48:02] <televisedrevolting> Wait does pat know about the glitch this mission hasM
[4:48:08] <%Taisuru> Rachni Friends
[4:48:09] <%X2Eliah> Andromeda with like twice the development time could have been decent
[4:48:12] <DatAsuna> james has a full on breakdown at the end that's prety fun
[4:48:12] <geassguy360> @geassguy360 @Jaysky lol its already been confirmed
[4:48:13] <%ingman112> With the Mako, I always loved staying in one place and just levitating over the rocket turrets
[4:48:13] <HaroldDonchee> shoot that thing
[4:48:14] <+Hyphixsys> this place is so random LUL
[4:48:19] <akitanito> big friendly fire
[4:48:21] <wolverinewaswrong> not the first player to shoot wrex
[4:48:24] <%X2Eliah> As always, EA rushed the shit out of that game
[4:48:27] <CorazonFeathers> Bye Elmo VoHiYo
[4:48:33] <Samurai_Tchan> they are doing an experiment
[4:48:39] <Jaysky> @mcjimbles @dero45 I... Wuh... How in the bloody fuck have I not heard this even once but heard about the remake over a dozen times
[4:48:40] <DSD24> Hey looks is the terrorist organization Cerberus
[4:48:44] <+pupil31> LOL
[4:48:48] <Samurai_Tchan> force lifter
[4:48:49] <%The_Protagonist> kill them all, Peter
[4:48:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Last time  I saw Cerberus loose this bad it was DMC 3
[4:48:54] <dero45> its literally invincible mode
[4:48:55] <+Hyphixsys> "threat:
[4:48:55] <CorazonFeathers> You do good!
[4:48:57] <%MidnightBurst12> rekt
[4:48:57] <%Eilocke> that's eliminated alright
[4:48:57] <$Wurmspawn> Health is coming from the armor mod you equiped not Barrier.
[4:48:58] <%JoshManVGH> And Cerberus was no more
[4:49:00] <Jaysky> Cerberus is no more!
[4:49:01] <murdocismyhero> It looks like you just murdered a bunch of normal people
[4:49:04] <MasterTonberry23> Andromeda both was, and wasnt rushed. it was developed for years, but almost all the real work was only done in the last few months
[4:49:06] <%Taisuru> Wrex
[4:49:08] <viewtifulr> Wrex.
[4:49:10] <%JoshManVGH> Fuck!
[4:49:11] <%peanutdot007> Cerberus is done forever now
[4:49:16] <+mcjimbles> @jaysky it’s all good it’s like 15 seconds of content lol
[4:49:16] <$SGrim> Why would Cerberus, a HUMAN SUPREMACIST organization, have a Krogan, Pat? Or do you just shoot any Krogan you see?
[4:49:17] <%maenos2> @jaysky you really missed it huh?  They showed a cinematic a while back as a teaser.
[4:49:18] <Samurai_Tchan> cerberus organization finished
[4:49:19] <JetpackMcQuack> good
[4:49:22] <%dekkitout> Perhaps, you might have
[4:49:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> ME1 is very breakable
[4:49:25] <%Chichen> cool
[4:49:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> well you're vanguard
[4:49:27] <geassguy360> Yeah barrier is O
[4:49:28] <DSD24> Its not that hard to do that Pat
[4:49:28] <$Wurmspawn> shepard...
[4:49:29] <%X2Eliah> basically, yeah
[4:49:29] <televisedrevolting> Yeah that's what playing Vanguard is like
[4:49:29] <geassguy360> P
[4:49:31] <DatAsuna> nah you break the game when you craft the full auto shotgun that never overheats
[4:49:32] <Samurai_Tchan> jack is saved
[4:49:34] <%bugz_munny> nah number kjeeps going up
[4:49:35] <retrosadness> the game is sooo much easier than vanilla
[4:49:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats the sign of a good RPG
[4:49:38] <AmericanaRed> YOU AINT WOOLIE
[4:49:40] <Dfreddy8> ME1 is broken you Say? impossible
[4:49:42] <MasterTonberry23> ME1 was made to be broken the hell out of
[4:49:44] <%X2Eliah> You might still need a one-shot-kill sniper rifle
[4:49:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> like building an assault rifle that you can just fire forever
[4:49:45] <%JoshManVGH> Your power is unmatched. Vanguard smash
[4:49:46] <%Chichen> *picks up phoenix spear* "yep"
[4:49:46] <Case_Ah_Dia> Get Wrexed gamer
[4:49:48] <Pookiedaexzile> and you haven't even gotten to the good shops on Noveria yet
[4:49:49] <geassguy360> Yep I love being overpowered in a game
[4:49:53] <CorazonFeathers> LUL
[4:50:00] <akitanito> he solved the puzzle
[4:50:01] <%Taisuru> @SGrim I mean shooting any Krogan you see isn't the worst idea, and I think they'd respect you more for it
[4:50:02] <wolverinewaswrong> The therum boss on hard was earier in legendary than original on Normal lol
[4:50:07] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie just picks bosses
[4:50:08] <%TheFabledAble> woolie is BIG COMBO
[4:50:08] <Kain5707> psaBig number go up
[4:50:12] <%The_Protagonist> it's been a long time since I've played ME1 but yeah I remember being untouchable a decent chunk of that game due to my loadout
[4:50:18] <CorazonFeathers> In a good way, I get that. Like the Nugget Bridge glitch in FRLG
[4:50:22] <Zeif00> This seems like a pleasant victory lap
[4:50:24] <%dekkitout> What Pat is describing is something being busted, something being buggy is broken
[4:50:29] <+Okashido> Has Pat already talked about how the Mako feels? I know if he did I probably missed it.
[4:50:31] <%moonmintparadise> Yeaaaahh Mass Effect 1 really needs a rebalancing mod to make the game more difficult. Some of the battles are hilariously easy.
[4:50:32] <DatAsuna> nah woolie did get broken op in paper mario
[4:50:39] <%X2Eliah> Man Outer Worlds was SUCH a letdown
[4:50:40] <%justcallmebobplease> I LOVED the beginning of Outer Worlds... and then it kept going...
[4:50:41] <Samurai_Tchan> and that game "we happy few ?" sounds like a good game
[4:50:43] <Dfreddy8> Unlimited assault rifle is OP
[4:50:45] <+Kingtut9009> Remember when people said Outer Worlds was better than New Vegas
[4:50:46] <$SGrim> @SGrim your stereotyping of Krogan has made Mordin sad. I hope you can live with that.
[4:50:47] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt congrats, you didn't call it Outer Wilds
[4:50:51] <DatAsuna> outer worlds was the biggest disappointment
[4:50:52] <Jaysky> @Okashido Said last stream it felt much nicer to drive
[4:50:54] <aiutare47> Outer Worlds was easy once you figured out that companions could get legendary weapons with infinite ammo
[4:50:57] <%GarbageNirvana> the bar for outer worlds could not have been lower
[4:50:57] <+mcjimbles> Honestly I’m hoping shep is dead/not protag in ME4 I think his story is done for better or worse
[4:50:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Hear me out....if Outerworlds had Gears of Mass Effect combat in 2
[4:51:05] <Pookiedaexzile> we might be cooking
[4:51:07] <+trackles_64> You can't shoot mars
[4:51:12] <tranquilturnip> he said it three times in his head first
[4:51:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> Outer Worlds' uncanny facial animation closeups in every dialogue sequence prevented me from even trying it
[4:51:23] <DatAsuna> outer worlds legit could have stood to have taken more mechanical cues from skyrim/fallout 4 to reduce the jank
[4:51:32] <Samurai_Tchan> no one cared about "we happy few" fuck , i thought it was good
[4:51:35] <DatAsuna> For all of FO4's problems it at least has a decent camera
[4:51:35] <%JoshManVGH> where taking those random debuffs ever worth it?
[4:51:37] <CorazonFeathers> Weeee
[4:51:39] <MasterTonberry23> I keep getting Outer Worlds and Outer Wilds confused in my head
[4:51:41] <DatAsuna> and an actual third person mode
[4:51:44] <Jaysky> Outer Worlds writing is still great and it's quite a polished game. I look forward to a sequel.
[4:51:47] <%ingman112> The capital city is the most disappointing part of that game
[4:51:56] <%JoshManVGH> I think i was offered like 2 the entire game...
[4:51:59] <DSD24> @JoshManVGH I made a glass cannon build so in my case yes
[4:52:03] <%ingman112> Buncha painted on doors and no nuance
[4:52:04] <%moonmintparadise> More games need a combat difficulty that makes ammo scarce or atleast not too common, with damage beeing high on both sides but the enemy being really aggressive.
[4:52:04] <Pookiedaexzile> OuterWorlds has 1 good level tho
[4:52:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what debuff?
[4:52:08] <DatAsuna> Outer Worlds completely misunderstoof what made the survival mechanic in new vegas work
[4:52:10] <geassguy360> @mcjimbles I really doubt it, Liara is shown finding N7 stuff...  Those characters, the Normandy... none of it works without shep
[4:52:16] <RetributionP> you think they will be scared to not use shep tho? after Andromeda
[4:52:17] <%Monkeyweed21> Far Harbor is WAY Better than all of Outer Worlds
[4:52:19] <%JoshManVGH> Cool system then.
[4:52:23] <+Okashido> Hey chat, which Mass Effect game would y'all say is the best? I'm an ME2 guy myself.
[4:52:25] <%Frodiddly> capital was where I gave up, I just couldn't deal with it's boring crap anymore
[4:52:28] <%Chichen> yah hack that rock
[4:52:33] <%aWanderingKaivo> jacked to the tits
[4:52:34] <DatAsuna> For starters making supernova mode a difficulty system was ridiculous
[4:52:34] <%moonmintparadise> I had Robo-Phobia and got a de-buff whenever I was around SAM. So that was not a lot of fun, but hilarious once I found it out.
[4:52:37] <MasterTonberry23> Guys ME4 probably wont be good, have you seen what Bioware has put out lately?
[4:52:37] <DSD24> Ashley won't be stacked
[4:52:39] <Parapattern> Outer Worlds was a solid B game
[4:52:44] <%charp35> Why did you have to hack the rocks?
[4:52:46] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder if anyone's modded outer worlds yet to give it more interesting purse to actually justify taking the flaws
[4:52:46] <notsoy> too bad you can't make rogue nukes with uranium in this game
[4:52:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Okashido i like me3 combat but me2 story
[4:52:56] <+Hyphixsys> @Chichen everything is computerized in the future Kappa
[4:52:58] <Pookiedaexzile> I like Mass Effect 1 and 2 for different reasons equally
[4:52:59] <CorazonFeathers> Kappa
[4:52:59] <+mcjimbles> @geassguy360 could be centuries after the fact since liara is the only one shown, but yeah I don’t think they’ll risk it
[4:53:01] <geassguy360> No one is saying it will be good.
[4:53:05] <geassguy360> just speculating
[4:53:05] <%GarbageNirvana> perks even
[4:53:12] <Samurai_Tchan> fallout 4 ?
[4:53:14] <+wmeldrum> wow that hurts
[4:53:15] <Jaysky> @Okashido ME2. While I enjoy the story of ME1 it feels rough, and I love the cast of 2 the most.
[4:53:15] <+Kindan55> Avowed should be cool
[4:53:17] <echobee_tv> Heck yeah dude
[4:53:22] <Samurai_Tchan> hum
[4:53:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Let them do it
[4:53:22] <MasterTonberry23> theres gonna be a fallout 4 new vegas?
[4:53:23] <%dekkitout> AND REMOVE THAT ORANGE FILTER
[4:53:25] <+Hyphixsys> @Samurai_Tchan DansGame
[4:53:26] <akitanito> mass effect new vegas
[4:53:26] <+Ropcord> it's a little on fire
[4:53:28] <DatAsuna> Yeah tbh
[4:53:28] <Samurai_Tchan> why not ,fallout canada ?
[4:53:30] <%dekkitout> Fucking hate it
[4:53:31] <Dunmarkh> @Samurai_Tchan the fallout 4 new vegas mod
[4:53:33] <+EmptyMug> SeemsGood
[4:53:35] <dero45> it would be pretty best
[4:53:35] <%X2Eliah> Never gonna happen
[4:53:41] <DatAsuna> I would be down for an alpha protocol that plays like an actual video game
[4:53:51] <Samurai_Tchan> @Samurai_Tchan huh
[4:53:52] <peachy996> Each Mass Effect has something I enjoy more than the others, even andromeda
[4:53:53] <morningmoondude> zombie zoo
[4:53:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Fallout 4 doesn't have a terrible green or brown filter
[4:53:57] <%MidnightBurst12> Ok then
[4:53:58] <%GarbageNirvana> literally all Bethesda has to do is stop using gamebryo and that would improve their games significantly
[4:54:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> nice shot npc
[4:54:02] <RetributionP> bruh what if they got the balls to call it new Vegas 2?
[4:54:04] <jorniev> jesus christ i just read the news about quantic dreams, david cajeh is worse than just a hack
[4:54:06] <%JoshManVGH> Just husks. nothing concerning about that
[4:54:08] <Parapattern> They're having all sorts of fun
[4:54:09] <dero45> husk experiments
[4:54:09] <viewtifulr> pfft you just merked them
[4:54:13] <%ingman112> @patstaresat I never heard whether you had an opinion on the Fallout Frontier controversy, pat
[4:54:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Mass Effect New Vegas: Thanes last day
[4:54:13] <%moonmintparadise> I would love to see a new CRPG Fallout, which is basically just Wasteland 3 without the IP
[4:54:18] <+Hyphixsys> riveting
[4:54:22] <+Okashido> @cobalt_phoenix_ Yeah I agree 100%, I loved how it felt to play a biotic in ME3. Curved my throws all over the place.
[4:54:25] <MasterTonberry23> @jorniev what happened? im too lazy to google
[4:54:25] <%DJFakie> So the LE curve is basically how Kiryu ends up at the end of every Yakuza
[4:54:31] <Samurai_Tchan> what about snowy places in fallout ?
[4:54:39] <viewtifulr> Wrex\
[4:54:40] <tranquilturnip> Wrex has chosen violence
[4:54:41] <DatAsuna> Speaking of which, did Pat ever play Jade Empire?
[4:54:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hm im curious as to what a fallout game set around the seattle area would be like, a pacific northwest environment
[4:54:42] <CheekyBirb> wrex loves you too
[4:54:45] <+Hyphixsys> that bumping LUL
[4:54:45] <%JoshManVGH> Wrex is a dear
[4:54:47] <$Wurmspawn> There are crates all around this room.
[4:54:52] <peachy996> Oh god here we go
[4:54:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Jade Empire is underrated
[4:54:59] <%dekkitout> @Samurai_Tchan America did annex Canada in pre war Fallout, it could work
[4:55:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> Boy I sure love killin', Shepard
[4:55:00] <dero45> how they get thorian zombies
[4:55:01] <peachy996> Dress him up in phoenix armor
[4:55:11] <%aWanderingKaivo> Man I wish they added the ME3 multiplayer to LE
[4:55:16] <akitanito> eeeeeeeehhhh
[4:55:16] <peachy996> LUL
[4:55:18] <dero45> fancy

[4:55:23] <+wmeldrum> Pink boy :3
[4:55:23] <DatAsuna> Jade Empire still has it's shortcomings but its probably the best antagonist bioware ever wrote
[4:55:23] <aiutare47> @MasterTonberry23 Pat mentioned it, he called all his female characters "Whores" said he doesnt make games for "fa s" a and then started bawling in court
[4:55:23] <Case_Ah_Dia> YES
[4:55:25] <%MaraSmug> Wrex lookin might cute
[4:55:25] <%dekkitout> YES YES YES!

[4:55:39] <geassguy360> BEST WREX GEAR
[4:55:39] <televisedrevolting> I am very upset I can't suck Wrex's dino pp
[4:55:40] <DatAsuna> Except maybe some of the swtor stuff like baras/thanaton
[4:55:48] <$Wurmspawn> There are crates all around the walls in that base.
[4:55:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Pink and white like cherry  blossoms
[4:55:51] <%JoshManVGH> it's like an ambulance crew
[4:55:51] <AthenaAegis> Wrex: "Now I feel beautiful."
[4:55:52] <RetributionP> you mean ash color wrex?

[4:56:44] <DSD24> Isn't that just play the game badly and die?
[4:56:44] <wolverinewaswrong> I heard that was a concept they were planning at one point
[4:56:45] <$Jedted> 11:48 pm here
[4:56:46] <SaphronBlackbourne> What did Pat do today
[4:56:46] <DatAsuna> well no that button kills more than just humans
[4:56:47] <$Wurmspawn> You leave the catalyst and say "F your choices"
[4:56:47] <geassguy360> only 8:48 here lol
[4:56:49] <%QueequegTheater> You leave Vega alone, he's a good boy
[4:56:52] <%ingman112> Planning to kill em both?
[4:56:54] <+ratchetex> kill all human just to fuck with the illusive man
[4:56:55] <+Hyphixsys> LUL
[4:56:58] <peachy996> It's called Synthesis and you turn everyone into freaks
[4:57:00] <Samurai_Tchan> ITS TREASON THEN
[4:57:02] <+Hyphixsys> that jumping wagon is comical
[4:57:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Biofreaks
[4:57:12] <tranquilturnip> I chose that LUL
[4:57:14] <aiutare47> 0 CONSENT
[4:57:16] <DSD24> That ending is garbage
[4:57:19] <televisedrevolting> Genetic FREAKS
[4:57:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> isn't that what you want?
[4:57:20] <$Futurecity10> its galactic rape basically
[4:57:20] <%dekkitout> You what?
[4:57:23] <%aWanderingKaivo> Synthesis is so god damn weird
[4:57:23] <beefcakemanthrob> synthesis is monstrous
[4:57:25] <peachy996> Plus the Husks
[4:57:27] <wolverinewaswrong> do people grow circuits in synthesis? never understood that
[4:57:28] <Samurai_Tchan> Create new man , bionic humans
[4:57:29] <geassguy360> It doesnt even make any sense logically
[4:57:29] <+Hyphixsys> I didn't hear it
[4:57:30] <%bugz_munny> who cares lol
[4:57:31] <peachy996> And the Reapers
[4:57:32] <+Hyphixsys> I'm deaf
[4:57:37] <%ingman112> It’s lunacy
[4:57:38] <peachy996> It's all completely fucked
[4:57:39] <+ReiDuran> who fucking cares about 3
[4:57:41] <Dfreddy8> Spoiler for a 8 year old game
[4:57:41] <tanarath> @patstaresat but you and paige would be robots
[4:57:42] <James_Quivers> That's why Destroy is gonna be the canon one
[4:57:43] <MasterTonberry23> aw man i havent beat me3 yet, thanks pat
[4:57:44] <Pookiedaexzile> TW: Galactic Rape
[4:57:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> then no one needs to use the bathroom, it's perfect
[4:57:45] <DatAsuna> synthesis and control are both massively unethical invasions of everyone's individuality and autonomy
[4:57:49] <%JoshManVGH> Just a space bug nothing of concern!
[4:57:50] <%miguelrod777> but oat didn't you want to become a machine
[4:57:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> no its fine send the synthesis juice out, everyone will get along its fine
[4:57:53] <%bread_assassin> So does Pat just know every major thing about ME3?
[4:57:53] <illtima> weird how these Cerberus grunts look completely different from the ones in ME3
[4:57:54] <buhbuhboat> Rachni side quest in ME1 is pretty cool, theres a unique enemy type that (I think) only appears on that quest
[4:57:55] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Basically just becoming reapers tbh
[4:57:55] <SaphronBlackbourne> I care about 3 :c
[4:57:57] <$Wurmspawn> There's also the ending that was added by a DLC where you just leave and don't choose any of the 3 original choices.
[4:57:58] <Samurai_Tchan> Create the homo bionics
[4:57:59] <+Alopekis> How's it a spoiler?
[4:57:59] <+trackles_64> synthesis isn't Canon tho cause mass effect 4
[4:58:02] <GustauveVIII> it digitized my dna thus making me a magic robot meatsack
[4:58:03] <Jaysky> @ReiDuran Me. Cause the game is good.
[4:58:05] <%emperordread> @Dfreddy8 I'm playing through series for first time
[4:58:07] <$Faustgesicht> This is Uncle Drew, he's a husk, and we're okay with that cuz we're brainwashed
[4:58:13] <televisedrevolting> Just finished ME 2 today.
[4:58:13] <geassguy360> So yeah Control then headcanon that shep sends all the reapers into the sun after rebuilding errything
[4:58:14] <+ALazo> Synthesis just gives the whole universe green tron lines and that is all it does
[4:58:16] <karl_rex> Rachni?
[4:58:18] <DatAsuna> Destroy is the only acceptable option because everyone knew the stakes and was prepared for that outcome.
[4:58:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DatAsuna synthesis i get why, but how is control bad in that sense?
[4:58:22] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Wurmspawn yeah that was more like a fuck you to people who wanted that option than anything
[4:58:23] <peachy996> You might as well have Kom susser tod play in the backround while you pick Synthesis
[4:58:24] <akitanito> weird cut
[4:58:28] <+Hyphixsys> F
[4:58:29] <+Okashido> I've never understood, even after looking into it, what people are so upset about with Mass Effect 3. It seems perfectly fine to me.
[4:58:30] <+trackles_64> F
[4:58:31] <%ingman112> @datasuna Control at least only interferes with the Reapers’ autonomy. It’s mainly a bad idea because there’s no guarantee Shepard can handle it
[4:58:32] <ioci2112> you choose destroy or you're a coward
[4:58:36] <DSD24> Oh man this sad music
[4:58:36] <akitanito> no shit tali
[4:58:36] <%QueequegTheater> Wrex is happy because he got to shoot something

[4:58:42] <CrypticMochi> Synthesis is what you killed Sarin for and control is what kill Cerberus for

[4:59:34] <CheekyBirb> sheppard gave him a taste of the normndeez nuts
[4:59:38] <DatAsuna> @ingman112 @cobalt_phoenix_ elevating yourself to essentially hold the entire universe at gunpoint is not okay just because you think you're a benevolent demigod and will be for all eternity.
[4:59:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Remember when Arin Hanson got a bunch of animators together to animate different endings to ME3
[4:59:47] <+Hyphixsys> "Master Barrier" Kappa
[4:59:47] <DatAsuna> Control is peak ego
[4:59:48] <%GarbageNirvana> ...also remember when Arin Hanson animated
[4:59:54] <%Taisuru> I master barrier every night
[4:59:54] <DatAsuna> At least in synthesis shepard dies
[4:59:57] <peachy996> Masterbarrier
[5:00:04] <televisedrevolting> Congrats, you killed Cerberus! Who you will never ever see again. Ever.
[5:00:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DatAsuna ah makes sense
[5:00:10] <Jaysky> @SaphronBlackbourne Some of the most memorable missions of ME are from 3 I find, and it plays well too but there's definitely big hiccups in the story but that don't make it bad.
[5:00:11] <Samurai_Tchan> if you use lift with warp, it creates an explosion
[5:00:14] <%ingman112> @datasuna Agreed, that’s essentially what I said. But it’s not as molecularly invasive as Synthesis
[5:00:17] <%Taisuru> Wrex
[5:00:18] <%DJFakie> @okashido Shepard bursts in, "THEY'RE BIG ORBS"
[5:00:19] <%JoshManVGH> He's like a color inverted Chancy
[5:00:21] <MasterTonberry23> @GarbageNirvana you mean that dude that does videos where he makes fart jokes with the dude from ninja sex party?
[5:00:34] <DatAsuna> instead of becoming the ultimate enemy of freedom, because nobody in the galaxy can be said to be free when they only live at shepard's pleasure
[5:00:35] <viewtifulr> once you have master barrier you have all the protection you need to get some Qurssy

[5:01:26] <Jaysky> If they want to.
[5:01:26] <+Okashido> @Okashido How does the ending not matter? Also, since when did a lot of your choices in the games matter? The games all end up the same way, pretty much no matter what you do. I guess I'm missing something though.
[5:01:26] <DatAsuna> I get why you wanna think that, but it's wishful thinking
[5:01:32] <Kghaleon> I hated all these sidequests, ended up skipping a lot of them.
[5:01:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but do they have the same memories tho?
[5:01:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Part of me likes to think ME4 won't be

[5:01:40] <Samurai_Tchan> they should had created the anti geth race
[5:01:40] <ioci2112> exactly, people can make more robots later, destroy is literally the only thing that makes sense
[5:01:42] <%dekkitout> Geth 2: Geth Harder?
[5:01:42] <thetunnelhomer> And I'm back what are we talking about?
[5:01:43] <mikeriffic> The geth are software
[5:01:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Just holda quarian at gun point
[5:01:43] <illtima> I mean, sure, but all those sentient Geths still die
[5:01:45] <mikeriffic> so like
[5:01:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if so then absolutely
[5:01:46] <peachy996> The body died
[5:01:47] <%Ranryu692> that's.... also true of humans, though
[5:01:47] <CorazonFeathers> Atem is in there PogChamp
[5:01:47] <Shatterthought> just restore from backup. ruuSip
[5:01:49] <NitronStreams> Geth 2 now with blackjack
[5:01:50] <James_Quivers> I think the extended cut mentions that the quarians do that if you make peace between them
[5:01:50] <Mattais88> The quarians have all the blueprints
[5:01:51] <akitanito> just destroy random relics
[5:01:52] <%miguelrod777> but they won't have anotomy like you give them
[5:01:52] <buhbuhboat> genocide is acceptable if you just reproduce to make back up the numbers
[5:01:54] <mikeriffic> maybe the data survived and just their bodies dided
[5:01:55] <illtima> it's like saying "you can make more children"
[5:01:57] <+burkey0307> inspect the top
[5:01:58] <beefcakemanthrob> you could also go control and make all reapers kill themselves
[5:01:59] <%ingman112> Lol tali would love that
[5:02:00] <+mcjimbles> I mean there’s some context missing in that statement lol
[5:02:01] <JetpackMcQuack> Geth 2
[5:02:01] <$Faustgesicht> Climb
[5:02:03] <otakon17> yeah you can make Geth AGAIN but they won't be the SAME geth that's like saying you can just make more babies if your first one dies
[5:02:03] <tanarath> HOP OUT & CLIMB UP
[5:02:05] <Pookiedaexzile> DO A JUMP OFF IT
[5:02:05] <%dekkitout> Geth 2: The Quest for more Geth
[5:02:05] <thetunnelhomer> Are we talking about ME3? Cause I can complain about ME3 for literal years
[5:02:06] <SaphronBlackbourne> I *want* ME4 to be good, but I won't keep my hopes up
[5:02:06] <+critikal_bit> The top?
[5:02:09] <capjordo> People said me3 was garb till andromeda came out, they’ll say the same about me4 when it does. They’re all good games.
[5:02:11] <%JoshManVGH> Imagine, making Geth and NOT immediately trying to kill them all.
[5:02:11] <+Okashido> Make the G1000, send it back in time to kill Shepard.
[5:02:11] <Dfreddy8> Geth 2: Geth boogaloo
[5:02:12] <geassguy360> The only reason to not take Shepard's monologue in the control ending at face value is the indoctrination theory and that has been thoroughly debunked.
[5:02:13] <+Hyphixsys> this music LUL
[5:02:14] <Pookiedaexzile> DO IT JUMP OFF IT
[5:02:17] <%ingman112> “They’re finally gone” “Alright let’s build em again”
[5:02:17] <%miguelrod777> but those sentient gets die
[5:02:24] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt which alien species do you most identify with Pat?
[5:02:25] <Oxybe> Geth 2: Geth Harder
[5:02:26] <+StaplerSama> did the mako have a speed boost in OG me1 or was that new to this i cant remember
[5:02:28] <CorazonFeathers> Kids toys PogChamp sell them online
[5:02:28] <MasterTonberry23> @capjordo andromeda is not a good game
[5:02:29] <$Jedted> can't make a new EDI.  at least not the same as she was
[5:02:29] <DSD24> Protheans had no toys get out of here
[5:02:30] <$Wurmspawn> Accept that the Geth who became senient effectively die. That's like saying "we killed your baby" and having the husband say to his wife, "Let's make ANOTHER one!"
[5:02:34] <Samurai_Tchan> Creat the boba geth , the baunty hunters
[5:02:35] <42nfl19> I was in and out but did Cerb merc that officer dude? I thought they were both pro-human/alliance or something? @PatStaresAt
[5:02:36] <Pookiedaexzile> NOW USE IT AS A RAMP
[5:02:44] <thetunnelhomer> Control is the worst ending because you give a cop unlimited power that just means nothing is ever gonna change
[5:02:47] <+thecowpow> that was teh worst star trek
[5:02:55] <%dekkitout> @Wurmspawn What's 17 more years?
[5:02:57] <capjordo> I loved andromeda sorry
[5:02:58] <thetunnelhomer> You better like the status que
[5:02:59] <+Hyphixsys> Amazon Kappa
[5:03:01] <%DJFakie> @wurmspawn So the SNL bit
[5:03:02] <geassguy360> lol what
[5:03:05] <thetunnelhomer> Or else you get reaper'd
[5:03:08] <aiutare47> @42nfl19 he was on to them and theyre doing super illegal stuff
[5:03:09] <buhbuhboat> Control is the ultimate narc ending
[5:03:13] <%ingman112> @42nfl19 He was gonna blow the whistle, so he had to go. Cerberus gives 0 fucks
[5:03:14] <DatAsuna> Exactly control is copgod infinity
[5:03:15] <Zalapski> @StaceMcGate pat loves him some elcor
[5:03:17] <capjordo> Fav still me2 tho
[5:03:25] <Samurai_Tchan> the boba geth could be the anti geth race
[5:03:27] <%Scottigecko> @42nfl19 They're pro human but not pro-alliance since the alliance is willing to not murder aliens on sight
[5:03:29] <VirtuaRailith> shooting probes is so satisfying
[5:03:29] <%aWanderingKaivo> @thetunnelhomer imagine someone playing renegade shep through the whole trilogy and picking control
[5:03:30] <+drawdehellfire> Probe Kreygasm
[5:03:30] <DatAsuna> There is NO HIGHER narcicism than thinking yourself worthy of godhood
[5:03:31] <%JoshManVGH> We need a better name for our cluster than "Local"
[5:03:34] <+mcjimbles> @42nfl19 they aren’t pro alliance generally
[5:03:36] <$Jedted> I LOVE Star Trek Voyager
[5:03:40] <+Ropcord> just turn the shepard VI into the sole dictator of the galaxy it's fine
[5:03:42] <+Hyphixsys> this looks dreadful, last I remember playing this game LUL
[5:03:44] <peachy996> I think it's worse in 3
[5:03:48] <VirtuaRailith> probe scouting for minerals the game
[5:03:49] <+Kindan55> Should'vs still had mako missions with the Hammerhead in 2
[5:03:51] <%MrBorisMakarov> man speaking of the probe mechanic, that feeling when you hit a multi element WITH eezo spike Kreygasm number go psaBig UP
[5:03:52] <peachy996> Big stupid BRAAAAAP noises
[5:03:58] <%DJFakie> Will you probe Uranus in ME2
[5:03:59] <CorazonFeathers> LUL
[5:04:00] <+Hyphixsys> NO HUMANS
[5:04:01] <DatAsuna> Any shepard that actually picks control needs to be attacked and dethroned
[5:04:01] <dero45> hacking rocks kinda interactive
[5:04:02] <Samurai_Tchan> YES THEY DESERVE TO DIE
[5:04:03] <Mattais88> All,Cereberus are Bastards
[5:04:06] <+ratchetex> they are evil tho
[5:04:08] <tanarath> They are
[5:04:09] <Pookiedaexzile> dundundun dootdoot dootdoot
[5:04:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I'LL NEVER WORK WITH THEM NU UH NEVER EVER
[5:04:10] <+vicar_anat> IN THIS LIFE OR THE NEXT!
[5:04:10] <%emperordread> Are they? I thought they were just pro human
[5:04:12] <Parapattern> I'll NEVER join Cerberus!
[5:04:14] <Kghaleon> The elusive man is my friend tho
[5:04:15] <%aWanderingKaivo> death to tyrants, etc
[5:04:21] <thetunnelhomer> I WILL NOT leave this planet until it is WIPE CLEAN of Cerberus!
[5:04:21] <capjordo> Andromeda got that right
[5:04:22] <aiutare47> Why is this planet called that? Its called Kidney basically
[5:04:24] <+Okashido> Yeah, we'll never work for cerberus! Hubris is a myth!
[5:04:24] <Broken_Sonex> I'LL KILL THEM ALL. I DON'T CARE HOW FAT THEIR ASS IS
[5:04:26] <Dfreddy8> All humans are evil.
[5:04:27] <+Zeromaru2> Except for Miranda, she's Morally Grey
[5:04:28] <geassguy360> Look all the endings are shit but control is still the least shit. No geth death or synthesis bullshit
[5:04:30] <+samiscoolbro> Rather die then join Cerberus
[5:04:30] <%charp35> So evil that I'll never work for them
[5:04:31] <RLT917> LU
[5:04:32] <@SSaryn> Especially into my 40s and 50s in which I will be older and possibly experience growing pains due to varying circumstances in which they totally weren't terrorists.
[5:04:35] <+Zeromaru2> Cause she's hot
[5:04:36] <%dekkitout> No quarter for the pawgs!
[5:04:38] <Samurai_Tchan> YEH ,WE FUCKING DONE PROFESSSIONALLY
[5:04:39] <%Monkeyweed21> what if they have a HUGE ass?
[5:04:39] <RLT917> LUL *
[5:04:42] <notsoy> even in death, the ass will still be fat
[5:04:46] <NitronStreams> Section 31
[5:04:48] <xcompleasedad> 31
[5:04:50] <tanarath> 31
[5:04:51] <+Kindan55> 31
[5:04:51] <%ingman112> @datasuna I’d be down for a Shepard that picked Control to save the geth/EDI and just immediately piloted every single Reaper into every single sun
[5:04:51] <CorazonFeathers> Kappa
[5:04:52] <thetunnelhomer> Section 31?
[5:04:52] <DSD24> Cerberus have cool armor and thats it
[5:04:52] <$Jedted> 31
[5:04:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so space cia
[5:04:53] <%CatastropheCorvid> Section 9
[5:04:56] <$Faustgesicht> Section 31
[5:04:56] <+Okashido> I'LL DIE BEFORE I JOIN CERBERUS@
[5:04:59] <%CatastropheCorvid> Wait. Wrong show
[5:05:02] <%JoshManVGH> Are you saying that Shepard didn't ask for this?
[5:05:03] <Drunkengen> I heard Section 31 sucks
[5:05:03] <arkv01> section 31 is a joke LUL
[5:05:03] <%peanutdot007> They fuck up everything all the time basically
[5:05:03] <RushUnplugged> at least they mention how they poached people that Shep wouldn't hate on sight because they knew Cerberus is absolute garbage trash
[5:05:05] <+pupil31> LOL
[5:05:07] <James_Quivers> True
[5:05:09] <%NateyBeak> section 31 gets real stupid in discovery
[5:05:11] <MasterTonberry23> Cerberus in this game were to give players an enemy to shoot with zero guilt. Theyre monsters! Kill em!
[5:05:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Space CIA
[5:05:17] <aiutare47> THATS LEGIT THE CERBERUS ARGUMENT
[5:05:18] <JetpackMcQuack> First directive*
[5:05:19] <$Wurmspawn> And Section 31 is based off of the Psy-corp from Babylon 5.
[5:05:22] <James_Quivers> Morals are indeed stupid
[5:05:25] <%AllenDeadman> moral high ground my ass
[5:05:25] <Dunmarkh> fair enough
[5:05:28] <geassguy360> @ingman112 Exactly, that is how I headcanon it. Use them to rebuild everything and then send them into a star
[5:05:28] <thetunnelhomer> Okay, here is how to make Control ending cool. Make the next custom protag be a Shepard-AI controlled puppet.
[5:05:30] <DatAsuna> @ingman112 we can't all be black ops 2 raul menendez
[5:05:33] <peachy996> Brooks! that was the other Cerberus woman's name
[5:05:34] <JetpackMcQuack> Prime Directive*
[5:05:37] <%JoshManVGH> They had an entire Mind Palace episode with Section 31
[5:05:39] <capjordo> Wish there were big booty space converse pawgs in this like in KOTOR
[5:05:40] <arkv01> did section 31 first show up in ds9?
[5:05:44] <%Taisuru> God the mako suck ass
[5:05:45] <thetunnelhomer> But reveal that in like have way through the game
[5:05:48] <Samurai_Tchan> Niko is your cousin
[5:05:49] <%ingman112> @datasuna Yo rough pull
[5:05:50] <peachy996> Brooks is the one who sets up your recruit list
[5:05:55] <DatAsuna> and even then shepard still exists as an immortal god, just sans mega fleet
[5:05:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they make the HARD decisions everyone's too afraid to make Kappa
[5:05:57] <AmericanaRed> cmonBruh I don't have a sbfpSweetbaby
[5:06:00] <DSD24> Destroy is really the only option
[5:06:04] <CorazonFeathers> Weeee Kappa
[5:06:04] <$Jedted> yes @arkv01
[5:06:05] <DatAsuna> And making yourself a god is still bullshit
[5:06:07] <Parapattern> It's dumb. That's the whole thought.
[5:06:10] <%Monkeyweed21> they are all terrible
[5:06:12] <geassguy360> @thetunnelhomer ME4 starts with shep being reborn from the catalyst, bam, cool new super powers
[5:06:13] <thetunnelhomer> Synthesis is dumb space magic, and can be ignored
[5:06:14] <Dfreddy8> So in Synthesis can you bang a Reaper then?
[5:06:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no they don't im pretty sure destroy is cannon
[5:06:18] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt If you also want to be Weeb about it, there is Root in Naruto
[5:06:18] <HaroldDonchee> the tal shiar fucks up so much stuff they had to have something to combat it
[5:06:19] <RushUnplugged> "after that whole Reaper deal, woof that was a lot, anyway"
[5:06:21] <James_Quivers> IT WAS ALL A DREAM
[5:06:21] <Broken_Sonex> @capjordo So many girl have big assess in KOTOR my God
[5:06:25] <%dekkitout> @capjordo Ya get Visas and the unending question of 'Wot dat mouf do?'
[5:06:28] <%DJFakie> Wolfenstein 2 it
[5:06:31] <beefcakemanthrob> or just rewrite it cuz they sucked
[5:06:33] <karl_rex> Destroy makes the most sense
[5:06:36] <JetpackMcQuack> The dlc added a LOT
[5:06:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not every ending has to be canon
[5:06:42] <+Toaderator> theyll make destroy canon
[5:06:42] <wolverinewaswrong> Shepard screws up and accidentally kills them while synthesizing?
[5:06:46] <%Monkeyweed21> DESTROY KILLS EDI AND LEGION
[5:06:48] <Samurai_Tchan> i wish we could turn a reaper into a humanoid female race
[5:06:51] <capjordo> @broken_sonex right lmao space pawg jedis are the best
[5:06:52] <DatAsuna> Destroy leaves shepard alive, synthesis kills shepard, control makes shepard an everpresent god
[5:06:52] <%skeleklng> What about the surrender ending
[5:06:54] <geassguy360> Control can be canon and satisfy those who want destroy by sayin shep sent them into a star
[5:06:57] <Mattais88> I can see where they're coming from with control, sacrifice yourself and save everyone else
[5:06:59] <%bread_assassin> IMO, I think ME4 is gonna take place after the Refusal ending, 50,000 years later in the next cycle.
[5:07:02] <James_Quivers> The Reapers died on the way back to their home system
[5:07:04] <%QueequegTheater> @Monkeyweed21 bruh Legion always dies
[5:07:09] <$Futurecity10> @Monkeyweed21 Legion is already dead, we have EDI back ups
[5:07:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just say the babies were normal or something idk
[5:07:10] <@SSaryn> BUT IT DID WE SEE IT
[5:07:10] <geassguy360> no shep uses them and then destroys them
[5:07:12] <thetunnelhomer> Pinochio geth deserve to get destroyed.
[5:07:14] <Dfreddy8> @monkeyweed21 Legion is already dead.
[5:07:17] <jorniev> or just felt innert
[5:07:20] <+Okashido> What about the other ending, where you say "fuck it" and leave a sticky note behind for the races after you that says "The reapers are bad, here's how to destroy them."
[5:07:20] <Pookiedaexzile> They get dicks and vags
[5:07:21] <@SSaryn> JOKER AND EDI COME OUT LIKE ITS NOTHING
[5:07:23] <RavenicusCrow> if they do another mass effect they better actually do the dark matter plotline this time
[5:07:23] <GustauveVIII> could have alternate reality where reapers arent a thing
[5:07:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> the best outcome for control is Shepreapers fixing the relays and then just sending the reapers into a star
[5:07:27] <%peanutdot007> Synthesis you say that eventually Sapce God Shep let everyone unrobot and flew off to a new galaxy or whatever
[5:07:27] <Pookiedaexzile> we gotta fuck the reapers
[5:07:29] <+mlow44> Why *would* it work?
[5:07:34] <thetunnelhomer> Turning Geth into dumb robots that are basically human is the worst
[5:07:34] <%JoshManVGH> How many of the reapers look like Sovereign?
[5:07:37] <VirtuaRailith> or that synthesis works, but it'll take like 5000 years to actually take hold because it's a long time.
[5:07:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YES
[5:07:39] <%Dapper_Cactuar> for synthesis just say the reapers felt they were now pointless and shut themselves down
[5:07:40] <dero45> sythesis would work but thats what the reapers wanted all along
[5:07:40] <@SSaryn> YES
[5:07:42] <JetpackMcQuack> Make ME4 in 5232 when AI is reaper status again
[5:07:43] <geassguy360> shep getting control and then destroying them eventually would show that it is still shep in charge
[5:07:43] <beefcakemanthrob> i hope they make shooting starchild in the head canon
[5:07:44] <$hattrick61> or just have Shepard realize the power was to evil and he just flew them all into the nearest black hole
[5:07:44] <@SSaryn> JOKER AND EDI WALK OUT
[5:07:45] <xcompleasedad> In Synth
[5:07:45] <tanarath> Synth DID WORK
[5:07:45] <%Taisuru> Make shep the villain with Synthesis ending canon, you're rebelling against him turning everyone into cyborgs
[5:07:46] <jorniev> REAPERS FELL INERT sounds like a good explanation for troubles down the line
[5:07:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> they just turn green
[5:07:46] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Yyup
[5:07:47] <Jaysky> Synth
[5:07:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no only synthesis and control i think
[5:07:49] <%Maids4lyfe> Synthesis, Shepard banged a Reaper and it caught space herpes and passed it on destroying the Reapers
[5:07:50] <Dabrikishaw> Yeah you can
[5:07:50] <James_Quivers> Not in the destroy ending, no
[5:07:52] <thetunnelhomer> EDI is 100% dead in destroy
[5:07:52] <DSD24> Pause
[5:07:54] <peachy996> I don't think the Geth taking those Reaper upgrades were goig to pan out for them in the long run
[5:07:55] <%charp35> In the extended cut dlc
[5:07:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> she does NOT come out in destoy
[5:07:56] <mikeriffic> no
[5:07:57] <tanarath> Edi isn't shown in destroy
[5:07:58] <%Dehlome> yeah theyre all husked out basically
[5:07:58] <@SSaryn> SYNTHESIS JOKER AND EDI GO OUT
[5:07:58] <+justianxix> he forgot!
[5:08:00] <mikeriffic> i just did all 3
[5:08:00] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> EDI and Joker walk out of the crashed Normandy
[5:08:01] <$hattrick61> EDI is on the memorial wall in destroy
[5:08:03] <mikeriffic> onyl synth you see it
[5:08:03] <AngryAsian5> In Synthesis
[5:08:05] <mikeriffic> not even in control
[5:08:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Destroy kills EDI
[5:08:06] <JetpackMcQuack> the added ending is the best ending
[5:08:08] <stormhawk9891> You see her on the wall of the dead
[5:08:09] <RushUnplugged> guys Pat doesn't even know about EDI's body from 3
[5:08:09] <mikeriffic> she just isnt there
[5:08:09] <DatAsuna> @geassguy360 shepard has to throw their own spacegod mind into a star too for it to be acceptable
[5:08:12] <$Jedted> "God" Shepherd maintains the Reapers
[5:08:12] <DatAsuna> Shepard has tfuck control
[5:08:13] <+Hyphixsys> @Maids4lyfe sounds about right LUL
[5:08:18] <Parapattern> "Tell me another story about The Shepard"
[5:08:19] <%ingman112> The real answer is that it’s gonna be so long after the events of the trilogy that it won’t matter or be referenced
[5:08:20] <mikeriffic> on Destroy EDI is on the Memorial wall
[5:08:21] <JetpackMcQuack> I literally thought it was a fan edit
[5:08:23] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[5:08:25] <jorniev> what  ending is the worst one?
[5:08:25] <$Wurmspawn> So the Catalyst's argument that was, "we've found different options besides just killing all synthetic life which will start the whole cycle over again" will be wrong anyways?
[5:08:25] <%Robot_Nixon_> synthesis ending everyone gets glitter all over them DansGame
[5:08:27] <tanarath> JUST USE SYNTHESIS TO GIVE US SPACE COMMUNISM
[5:08:30] <Samurai_Tchan> @SSaryn sex changes people
[5:08:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no it doesn't that's what they fought for
[5:08:38] <%emperordread> Never trust a toaster
[5:08:41] <James_Quivers> Counterpoint: Fuck robots tho
[5:08:42] <geassguy360> Really doubt they will bring back liara and no one else
[5:08:43] <@SSaryn> Yeah Destroy is basically everyones dead but Joker and EDI are TOTALLY just walking out the Normandy on a planet somewhere.
[5:08:46] <Samurai_Tchan> creat the third impact
[5:08:46] <mikeriffic> Sytheisis adds the tech effect to their clothes to....
[5:08:47] <GustauveVIII> what robots do we have in 3 aside from legion and edi
[5:08:51] <HaroldDonchee> I liked synthesis because joker got his legs back
[5:08:52] <DatAsuna> I disagree, they were ready to fight to death and explicitly say so.
[5:08:53] <Pookiedaexzile> But fuck em, we Bleed
[5:08:54] <mikeriffic> It looks bad
[5:08:54] <%emperordread> @James_Quivers This guy gets it
[5:08:54] <thetunnelhomer> Legion and the Geth would be totally down for sacrificing themselves to kill the reapers
[5:08:54] <ioci2112> everybody was ready to sacrifice themselves to stop the reapers, that includes edi and the geth
[5:08:56] <JetpackMcQuack> Robots do not dream of electric sheep
[5:08:58] <Pookiedaexzile> they spark
[5:08:59] <%JoshManVGH> Shepard is mostly robot for god sake
[5:09:01] <DatAsuna> It's the only thing that honors their sacrifice.
[5:09:01] <seaechiowai> your robots knew what was coming
[5:09:02] <geassguy360> Fuck destroy, no geth no deal
[5:09:04] <jorniev> THE CONTROL ENDING MEANS ILUSIVE MAN WAS RIGHT
[5:09:04] <DSD24> Geth
[5:09:04] <Kghaleon> Yo if we're talking about future games I'm out, haven't beat the trilogy yet.
[5:09:05] <mikeriffic> Tali had green synth stuff on her hood
[5:09:06] <JetpackMcQuack> fuckem
[5:09:06] <tranquilturnip> I thought the control ending was "control reapers and leave galaxy"
[5:09:13] <karl_rex> I bet they just write in a fourth ending that leaves as much as the old cast alive as possible
[5:09:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> that's not guaranteed though
[5:09:14] <Samurai_Tchan> YES
[5:09:15] <%emperordread> I just started ME2, I can't WAIT to anihilate all robots
[5:09:17] <Samurai_Tchan> LEGION
[5:09:17] <$Futurecity10> Fuck em build more
[5:09:17] <Botman_R> I mean, yeah. If they didn't do that, everyone would always pick destroy as the best option.
[5:09:21] <42nfl19> Wait I thought there were 4 endings? the 3 colors and child? @PatStaresAt
[5:09:21] <%QueequegTheater> @tranquilturnip no leaving
[5:09:21] <+Okashido> Yeah I went with Synthesis because its the "point-of-view" wave
[5:09:22] <thetunnelhomer> @tranquilturnip Nope. You become Cop-god
[5:09:22] <geassguy360> Control and then shep sends the reapers into a star
[5:09:22] <+OneGorillionDollars> no it doesn't, both edi and legion recognized the reapers as awful and worth destroying
[5:09:22] <JetpackMcQuack> biology is where it's at
[5:09:22] <HeroToxiko> green ending is unironically the best ending
[5:09:24] <James_Quivers> They're all basically clones of Legion tho, so they only still count for Legion
[5:09:25] <%ingman112> @kghaleon Probably a good idea
[5:09:26] <jorniev> DO IT FOR THE GETH
[5:09:27] <thetunnelhomer> God of Narcs
[5:09:29] <capjordo> I feel like it was aya at the end scene
[5:09:30] <Samurai_Tchan> theres a way to save legion and tali
[5:09:30] <peachy996> The Geth become individuals once Legion sacrifices himself
[5:09:36] <%ArcanumArcanum> just pick green ending because cyborgs are cool
[5:09:37] <geassguy360> yeah the geth are a big asset
[5:09:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Just back em up on the cloud
[5:09:40] <DatAsuna> Picking any of the other 3 endings not only betrays what everyone who died by then was fighting for, but also makes you complicit with everything the reapers did.
[5:09:41] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt I got the perfect ending for the geth and the Quarian and then the game had the gal to tell me that "Co-Existence is impossible!" And shepard is like, oh man you may be right
[5:09:42] <%dekkitout> @Futurecity10 What's 17 more decades
[5:09:43] <dero45> @Javi9563  RIP
[5:09:44] <$Futurecity10> Lucky machines dont have souls
[5:09:44] <%charp35> I didn't pick destroy because I didn't want to kill the geth
[5:09:48] <peachy996> So you kill an individual race of Geth for Destroy plus maybe Edi
[5:09:49] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the destroy ending makes the whole geth "redemption" arc pointless
[5:09:53] <JetpackMcQuack> It's the S8
[5:09:54] <James_Quivers> ME3 IS VERY EVOCATIVE
[5:09:56] <Dfreddy8> Just freeze Shepherd 50,000 years for the Yahg to find.
[5:09:57] <CrypticMochi> Synthesis is what you killed Sarin for
[5:09:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DatAsuna EXACTLY
[5:09:58] <thetunnelhomer> We are gonna talk about the ending for MONTHS
[5:09:59] <mikeriffic> Extended cut helped a lot buuuuuut
[5:09:59] <geassguy360> @DatAsuna bullshit
[5:10:00] <%Taisuru> It literally poisons every moment that came before it
[5:10:00] <beefcakemanthrob> shoot starchild is best ending cuz fuck that kid and his options
[5:10:01] <mikeriffic> it was worse
[5:10:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Its a bad
[5:10:06] <tanarath> It's suit, yeah
[5:10:06] <wolverinewaswrong> I only ddid control for my geth buddies
[5:10:07] <mikeriffic> but its still not perfect
[5:10:09] <DSD24> ME 2 is so good so there's not much discussion
[5:10:09] <%ingman112> It’s impossible to avoid
[5:10:09] <DatAsuna> if you pick control, you have betrayed everyone who isn't the illusive man.
[5:10:13] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun
[5:10:16] <@SSaryn> PICK SYNTHESIS AND FENCE SIT
[5:10:18] <akitanito> destroy but only a litte
[5:10:19] <jorniev> "A BAD ENDING CAN TOTALLY RUIN A SERIES"- PAT
[5:10:20] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS A NARRATIVE SERIES THE ENDING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
[5:10:20] <Samurai_Tchan> the geth could be protocol droids
[5:10:21] <James_Quivers> If you pick control, you can BECOME the geth
[5:10:22] <+drawdehellfire> Naan option
[5:10:24] <%dekkitout> Preserve our brobots
[5:10:24] <beefcakemanthrob> but make more, pat
[5:10:24] <%miguelrod777> agree
[5:10:25] <peachy996> pick refuse and shoot the star child
[5:10:25] <capjordo> It’s such a polarizing entry lmao I love me3
[5:10:25] <tanarath> Thank you for that, Pat
[5:10:27] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Directors cut has a literal give up option
[5:10:28] <+Toaderator> the geth get redemption in destroy tho
[5:10:29] <DSD24> But the other two are way worse
[5:10:30] <NitronStreams> me3s ending is probably one of the most well known pasts of the series sadly
[5:10:30] <jorniev> TRUE
[5:10:30] <+bassforte123> The geth just want you to please stop shooting them in the face for no reason but the game says Organics are the good ones
[5:10:31] <CorazonFeathers> LUL
[5:10:32] <karl_rex> But the Reapers got to go man
[5:10:33] <akitanito> true
[5:10:33] <%aWanderingKaivo> synthesis is bullshit space magic and control is wildly irresponsible
[5:10:34] <$hattrick61> Just pull a deus ex HR: Use control to send all the reapers into the nearest star
[5:10:34] <%JoshManVGH> They did nothing wrong
[5:10:36] <buhbuhboat> I get what they were going for with synthesis with the whole ascending to a new form of life but forcing it on the whole galaxy against their will makes it yikes
[5:10:37] <$SGrim> @SSaryn World's most laughable centrist
[5:10:37] <%Torus1025> Literally NOTHING
[5:10:37] <geassguy360> Destroy betrayes the geth and edi
[5:10:37] <+Okashido> I liked it fine. I don't get what everyone is upset about. I never experienced what people did.
[5:10:38] <$Wurmspawn> To be frank, I know I'm a minority here, I actually like the endings in ME3. I do. I'm not ashamed to admit it and I know I'm going to get "one guy"ed for it.
[5:10:38] <NitronStreams> parts*
[5:10:38] <tranquilturnip> its a pretty good fence I say sit on it
[5:10:38] <%emperordread> Toasters can only do what they are programmed to do
[5:10:39] <%AllenDeadman> true enough
[5:10:41] <geassguy360> thank you pat
[5:10:41] <JetpackMcQuack> It's like the thesis of the game
[5:10:42] <%ingman112> This is where mods save the day
[5:10:42] <%Arancet> uh, until they aligned with reapers
[5:10:43] <mikeriffic> Its a shame that destroy seems to be the only choice thats effect by your Galatic readiness
[5:10:43] <Pookiedaexzile> HE SAID THE LINE
[5:10:43] <SaphronBlackbourne> I won't deny 3's ending is bad but I still love 3, I might call it my fave cuz of the gameplay
[5:10:45] <James_Quivers> Counterpoint: Robots bad
[5:10:46] <thetunnelhomer> Cop god or space magic
[5:10:47] <%charp35> Refuse is my favorite ending because shepherd just goes fuck this
[5:10:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DatAsuna literally everything they sacrificed themselves for the purpose of destroying them and anything else is saying "lol sorry you died for nothing"
[5:10:47] <Samurai_Tchan> we need to create the geth in real life
[5:10:49] <Jaysky> Geth are just robotic versions of dogs
[5:10:49] <+Hyphixsys> the Geths are there, standing, menecingly, and the humans just goes and kills it
[5:10:51] <mikeriffic> the other two arent effected...only the slideshow
[5:10:52] <HeroToxiko> i didn't literally convince two whole races to stop doing a geocide to just do a genocide LUL
[5:10:52] <KnightOfTrousers> What about the geth that joined Reapers?
[5:10:56] <Pookiedaexzile> But Tali's So thicc
[5:11:00] <peachy996> You can save scum the endings anyway.
[5:11:00] <geassguy360> CONTROL IS THE LEAST SHIT OF A SHIT SET OF CHOICES
[5:11:01] <%DJFakie> @emperordread Aigis would like some words
[5:11:02] <Samurai_Tchan> OUR WORLD NEED A GETH RACE
[5:11:02] <+trackles_64> the reapers did nothing wrong they are also machines
[5:11:03] <DSD24> Heretics!
[5:11:07] <+spartanluchador534> i subscribe to legion supremacy
[5:11:07] <+WiredBall> i never played 2 or 3 but i thought the whole ending snafu was that they we all just different colored lasers or is ther real stuff there and i should play the games
[5:11:07] <%bread_assassin> But then they all do in ME3
[5:11:08] <wolverinewaswrong> control but Shepard tells the reapers to fly into the sun?
[5:11:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @KnightOfTrousers those ones can go
[5:11:13] <thetunnelhomer> Actually Geth totally side up with the reapers in 3
[5:11:13] <%ingman112> Now I wanna see Legion chilling with a Femto mask
[5:11:13] <HeroToxiko> genocide*
[5:11:15] <$Jedted> ME3 is more Polarizing than the Sequel Trilogy
[5:11:15] <thetunnelhomer> It's a plot point
[5:11:16] <Botman_R> AND THEN THEY DID IT AGAIN AFTER
[5:11:17] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the geth came so far and did so much just to be treated with respect to get wiped out as a side effect is a dumb
[5:11:19] <dero45> destroy resets us back to the stone age tho
[5:11:20] <%JohnAtDawn> Isnt the Geth who worship the reapers like, a pathetically small percent of their race?
[5:11:21] <seaechiowai> are ya winning son
[5:11:21] <+Okashido> Also reapers can mind control.
[5:11:21] <AmericanaRed> sbfpBleetz PREACH BROTHER
[5:11:24] <peachy996> Just save at a certain point in London and you go back to do each ending
[5:11:25] <Pookiedaexzile> It was bull shit when they did it too
[5:11:25] <$hattrick61> Commit genocide for dem tali hips
[5:11:26] <%JoshManVGH> Didn't they get indoctrinated, but programmatically?
[5:11:26] <capjordo> Geth fuck hard
[5:11:29] <%moonmintparadise> ROBOT PEOPLE ARE JUST REALLY FUCKING COOL IN GENERAL
[5:11:30] <%AllenDeadman> sure is
[5:11:30] <%MrBorisMakarov> no it's great shut up
[5:11:31] <+Hyphixsys> these AIs LUL LUL
[5:11:35] <karl_rex> They all aligned with the Reapers initially in 3 when they gave them the code to all be individual units
[5:11:39] <tanarath> So much better than 2
[5:11:44] <%QueequegTheater> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[5:11:47] <%dekkitout> So the evil Geth are like the Black Garden Vex?
[5:11:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do they not have combat barks anymore?
[5:11:49] <Samurai_Tchan> just increase dificulty
[5:11:50] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna If you go along with the reapers in synthesis or co-opt them in control you have the blood of every previous cycle on your hands.
[5:11:51] <%Ranryu692> that's why 3rd Person Shooters aren't great
[5:11:51] <geassguy360> Modded destroy is the only acceptable destroy ending
[5:11:52] <+midnightq2> vanguard?
[5:11:55] <dero45> how would u dodge bullets
[5:11:57] <%Monkeyweed21> The Geth you fight in ME1 are an extreme Geth Supremacist faction
[5:11:57] <%ingman112> This is where mods are great, because you can have the Crucible choices but if your War Assets are high enough you don’t destroy the robots
[5:11:58] <%TheFabledAble> they literally were slaves, then faced genocide, so they made the planet uninhabitable so as to push the Quarian off the planet with as little bloodshed as possible, then with convincing welcome the Quariaan back in order to attempt peace
[5:12:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Use your powers
[5:12:01] <+mcjimbles> @botman_r they were enslaved/ forced into a corner by quarians
[5:12:09] <HeroToxiko> @dekkitout thats who the vex were based on LUL
[5:12:10] <Basch71> enemies in 1 have like no self regard, its hilarious
[5:12:12] <Pookiedaexzile> You need line of sight
[5:12:13] <$hattrick61> Im kinda sad they toned down the "I WILL DESTROY YOU ENEMIES EVERYWHERE GOGOGO
[5:12:14] <James_Quivers> I remember describing this game as little army men toys banging together even when it first came out
[5:12:17] <Samurai_Tchan> just use the force
[5:12:24] <HeroToxiko> besides the borg obviously
[5:12:26] <peachy996> Enemies seem quieter
[5:12:29] <HaroldDonchee> I remember tali killed herself in my game and I immediately ripped the cord out of my xbox
[5:12:34] <James_Quivers> FAKE GAME
[5:12:35] <%Rumbutt> Just don't use targeted abilities while in cover
[5:12:36] <peachy996> No more GOGOGO
[5:12:37] <CSeriesJTYPE> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[5:12:37] <%dekkitout> @HeroToxiko Hey now, I'm doing a Woolie. I'm basing it on what I already know.
[5:12:38] <akitanito> more robotic than geths
[5:12:39] <%DJFakie> Enemies everywhere!
[5:12:39] <%aWanderingKaivo> they don't take cover really
[5:12:41] <DatAsuna> There shouldn't have been a single option to save both the quarians and geth tbh
[5:12:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> they just run at you
[5:12:43] <CorazonFeathers> @James_Quivers banging together? KappaPride
[5:12:44] <DoubleBalut> yeah I WILL DESTROY YOU  is peak ME1.
[5:12:45] <thetunnelhomer> In the absense of Destroy, Cop-god ending is the only way to go.
[5:12:45] <%ingman112> Playing this game as a sniper is...let’s say a unique challenge
[5:12:46] <CSeriesJTYPE> HOLD THE LINE
[5:12:52] <DatAsuna> It should have been a set outcome based on your prior quests
[5:12:54] <+Okashido> @PatStaresAt Which ammo type causes the cruelest death?
[5:12:55] <Profmcstevie> The curtain was never even drawn over the man working the levers
[5:13:04] <Pookiedaexzile> THey move like you do but you can see it from your point of view
[5:13:09] <Dfreddy8> ME2 Friendly AI cover is broken AF
[5:13:10] <peachy996> Has to be Polonium
[5:13:12] <Pookiedaexzile> they fix that in 2
[5:13:17] <jorniev> and you turn around so slow
[5:13:18] <peachy996> You melt into green goo
[5:13:19] <DatAsuna> Instead of shepard just having enough blue/red points to end centuries of race war with a single prompt.
[5:13:19] <$Wurmspawn> No Pat! Don't shoot Gief!
[5:13:22] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I will never go destroy ending since I don't want all the efforts the player and the geth do in order to make coexistence a possibility a giant waste of time
[5:13:25] <jorniev> and the enemies too
[5:13:30] <tanarath> @okashido fire or acid
[5:13:32] <Samurai_Tchan> nanonizer
[5:13:33] <geassguy360> honestly dont get how people DONT achieve peace with the quarians/geth. Do you just rush straight into the final rannoch mission without doing the others? I have never NOT gotten peace.
[5:13:44] <%ingman112> @datasuna It does depend on an accumulation of points from quests too, in fairness
[5:13:45] <tanarath> radiation is bad too
[5:13:48] <%Monkeyweed21> KATANA VI
[5:14:00] <GustauveVIII> legion dead in ME2 or not recruited is how you not get peace
[5:14:02] <akitanito> you don't even get penalised for hitting the blocks
[5:14:04] <%Monkeyweed21> you missed 1 @PatStaresAt
[5:14:05] <%aWanderingKaivo> its pretty funny that all the discussion on ME3 endings is "which makes you throw up in your mouth the least"
[5:14:05] <+trackles_64> cat an a
[5:14:06] <DoubleBalut> Kay tana
[5:14:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im still pissed off that solving the quarian/geth conflict did nothing to convince that little shit child that synths and organics can co exist
[5:14:07] <mak0t0yukii> Kaytana 6
[5:14:07] <Samurai_Tchan> it means japanese sword
[5:14:12] <peachy996> I sometimes picked sides for different playthroughs to make things interesting
[5:14:13] <Dfreddy8> it shoots 6 swords at once Kappa
[5:14:13] <+poysendemon> K-TANA
[5:14:14] <DatAsuna> @ingman112 yes but arbitrary paragon/renegade points, no actual specific actions
[5:14:14] <+mcjimbles> @geassguy360 can be pretty easy to get tail killed in me2 if you don’t know what you’re doing
[5:14:18] <%Monkeyweed21> you missed a locker
[5:14:19] <+Okashido> See Radiation comes across to me as pure atonization.
[5:14:20] <%ClericOfSparda> I'm only half paying attention and get confused where you are all the time.
[5:14:20] <Pookiedaexzile> My Sword
[5:14:21] <peachy996> Turns out Tali isn't a great swimmer
[5:14:34] <capjordo> How the fuck is he doing those so fast
[5:14:34] <+OneGorillionDollars> can you still get your shotgun as accurate as a sniper in the legendary edition?
[5:14:38] <+JonathLP> ME1 is a hell of a drug
[5:14:41] <%Puhff> psaDogchamp
[5:14:50] <ioci2112> with control, you also run the risk of shepard going full catalyst on the galaxy's ass after 10000 years of being disconnected from everyone and coming to the same conclusions
[5:14:54] <%ingman112> @datasuna No you need 5 “Peace Points” besides Paragon/Renegade
[5:14:56] <KeystoneA2> The way they reworked things you'll probably have Spectre Master Gear by Virmire
[5:14:57] <DoubleBalut> Why's Tali the best though.
[5:15:02] <Samurai_Tchan> thats the most hackeable minigame ever
[5:15:06] <+trackles_64> upgrades become meaningless after a while
[5:15:07] <+SargentToughie> I love ME1's numbers going up
[5:15:07] <DatAsuna> @geassguy360 Barely anybody lacks the points to do one or the other. I just hate that the game throws hard choices at you but then gives you cop out "best outcome" answers that invalidate even having a choice at all.
[5:15:11] <+Okashido> But fire also comes across as disintegration, turning them into ash.
[5:15:22] <%DJFakie> @KeystoneA2 Yes, actually, can confirm
[5:15:39] <%StaceMcGate> there's more
[5:15:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> only way control is stomachable is if shep sends the reapers into a sun
[5:15:44] <%StaceMcGate> when you do the arachnid
[5:15:45] <%walternatorz> good riddance
[5:15:46] <Samurai_Tchan> sometimes ,life inst a show
[5:15:48] <+trackles_64> well for this game
[5:15:50] <+midnightq2> hack the mainframe
[5:15:52] <tanarath> It might not be
[5:16:07] <%Puhff> HACKERMAN
[5:16:11] <%DJFakie> You're getting conflicting messages
[5:16:13] <thetunnelhomer> Yea. The more I think about it, Control has almost 0 downsides especially if you are paragon.
[5:16:14] <%Ranryu692> H A C K E R M A N
[5:16:14] <%DJFakie> You're done
[5:16:18] <CorazonFeathers> Gonna sleep, goodnight!
[5:16:24] <Samurai_Tchan> elusiveman will remember that
[5:16:29] <DatAsuna> even then control is just the everpresent possibility of shepard to be an even bigger threat
[5:16:34] <ChungusQuest> @aWanderingKaivo I don't know, Reapers would probably be crazy good at large-scale deep space construction projects.
[5:16:43] <%Scottigecko> naw fuck that kid up
[5:16:45] <thetunnelhomer> Shepard can just download himself into a EDI bot
[5:16:53] <%DJFakie> 4 is what's in the gun
[5:16:59] <geassguy360> control then reapers into a black hole, that simple
[5:17:03] <$Wurmspawn> Remember. Pat will live on. Even in the form of a toilet. But in this case, Pat gets to live on in the Reapers.
[5:17:03] <%RonaldMcDownload> If you assume Control works, then Destroy is dumb.
[5:17:04] <DatAsuna> Saying that you deserve to be king of the universe is not okay.
[5:17:07] <xcompleasedad> Control implies that you might become a genocider yourself
[5:17:10] <JetpackMcQuack> It's a Deus ex Machina into a McGuffin, wombo combo
[5:17:11] <Samurai_Tchan> shepard is alive
[5:17:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @aWanderingKaivo that can get slippery depending on what you feel like building
[5:17:25] <+mcjimbles> Idk whose to say shephard doesn’t go crazy killer after centuries pass
[5:17:28] <HeroToxiko> green ending is best, genocide bad
[5:17:38] <thetunnelhomer> As long as Cop-god Shepard finds a way to connect with his humanity it should be fine.
[5:17:46] <CSeriesJTYPE> did you see the dialogue where shepard says "keep that earth first shit off my ship" and she ACTUALLY says "I hope a little less bigoted than THAT"
[5:17:47] <thetunnelhomer> Green ending is super dumb and lame
[5:17:48] <%Puhff> I like the ending where Shep just gives up and lets the Reapers win cuz uhhhhh it's real hard to decide :(
[5:17:49] <%aWanderingKaivo> @aWanderingKaivo absolutely it depends on how much being the reapers affects your mind
[5:17:53] <CSeriesJTYPE> to ashley I mean
[5:17:54] <CrypticMochi> Eh, just become a stupid AI god
[5:17:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEAAAA MAKO
[5:17:57] <$Wurmspawn> Pat!
[5:17:58] <%DJFakie> WHOA MAKO
[5:17:58] <ChungusQuest> @aWanderingKaivo Well what about some sort of gigantic superweapon, big enough that nobody would ever thi--oh shit.
[5:17:59] <feefer_drunk3rland> me3 ending in a nutshell Witch explosions colour to you like :)
[5:18:01] <CheekyBirb> lmfao
[5:18:04] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt that bug on noveria for maxing out paragon and or renegade is still in the game btw
[5:18:04] <$Wurmspawn> You looked away at the wrong time.
[5:18:06] <+ReiDuran> oh my gods
[5:18:06] <Zemetro> he missed it
[5:18:06] <%QueequegTheater> Finally finished my light grind, I'm so close to Cronus Lux
[5:18:06] <%DJFakie> SICK NASTY FLIPS YOU MISSED
[5:18:07] <%JoshManVGH> Pat!
[5:18:09] <+Stynklord> YOU MISSED IT
[5:18:09] <peachy996> Good job Mako!
[5:18:10] <wolverinewaswrong> The mako just fell out of the sky
[5:18:11] <+ReiDuran> oh my god
[5:18:11] <notsoy> lol pat totally missed that
[5:18:12] <%Garthunox> OH YOU MISSED IT!
[5:18:13] <Pookiedaexzile> NObody say anything
[5:18:14] <+trackles_64> lool
[5:18:16] <+ReiDuran> holy fuck oh my god
[5:18:17] <%RonaldMcDownload> You guys remember Marauder Shields?
[5:18:19] <geassguy360> which is why you then headcanon that shep destroys the reapers. stop acting like ANY of these endings dont require mental gymnastics to be even acceptable
[5:18:20] <+midnightq2> sick
[5:18:20] <Dfreddy8> Pat "Woolie" Boivain
[5:18:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Nobody say anything
[5:18:21] <wolverinewaswrong> you misse the Mako!
[5:18:22] <RavenicusCrow> no one say a thing
[5:18:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he actually missed it
[5:18:25] <+ReiDuran> I can't believe that just happened
[5:18:27] <HeroToxiko> control is unironically the worst ending
[5:18:28] <%JoshManVGH> Did som9ne clip that shit?
[5:18:30] <+pmtriox> @RonaldMcDownload every day
[5:18:32] <peachy996> Never forget Marauder Shields
[5:18:32] <RushUnplugged> best ending: Control, fix everything, then point ALL REAPER GUNS at Ashley, just her, regardless of dead or alive status
[5:18:32] <AmericanaRed> LMAO
[5:18:35] <%DJFakie> The Mako did a sick trick and you looked down right then
[5:18:35] <CSeriesJTYPE> it did a flip
[5:18:36] <nekrabeats> Nah its fine pat
[5:18:37] <+trackles_64> clip  it
[5:18:37] <+spartanluchador534> it sucks that shepard dies in every ending except for destroy
[5:18:38] <+Kharinite> Someone clip it
[5:18:38] <Samurai_Tchan> ITS SELF AWARE
[5:18:40] <%ingman112> @PatStaresAt Control should have been the ultimate Renegade option, where it’s “I’m going to follow Cerberus ideals and drag humanity to the top of the heap.” Instead it’s “Paragon” by default because wiping out the geth as collateral is fucking nuts
[5:18:40] <+Kharinite> Please
[5:18:47] <Dfreddy8> Uh yes Marauder Shields
[5:18:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Nope
[5:18:51] <tanarath> emlo
[5:18:55] <%Dakuu75> Elmo~
[5:18:56] <%JoshManVGH> It fucking flew at the screen dude
[5:19:00] <%Da_Big_Mac> psaPorgmo
[5:19:02] <DatAsuna> Anderson picked control for a reason.
[5:19:11] <+midnightq2> InuyoFace
[5:19:13] <+jubjub388> elmooo
[5:19:13] <Parapattern> The ME3 ending is just a giant gender reveal party
[5:19:13] <susukouhai> pat cat, pet cat
[5:19:16] <%ingman112> You mean TIM
[5:19:17] <$Wurmspawn> ***
[5:19:19] <%QueequegTheater> Please tell me someone clipped that
[5:19:21] <Kidbizzaro> GlitchCat
[5:19:21] <peachy996> Anderson was in favor for Destroy
[5:19:22] <+spartanluchador534> i wanna have cute space babies with jack
[5:19:22] <DatAsuna> *didn't picked lol
[5:19:23] <%JoshManVGH> You stopped crime
[5:19:23] <+mcjimbles> I think I’m a synthesis guy overall
[5:19:27] <3viltiki> I love the ballerina Mako shit
[5:19:31] <DSD24> Oh wow these camera work
[5:19:34] <Samurai_Tchan> XCOM LEADER
[5:19:38] <CSeriesJTYPE> "I am also Mark Meer"
[5:19:39] <peachy996> The Illusive Man was in favor of Control
[5:19:39] <DatAsuna> shush it's 5AM I typo'd -_-
[5:19:39] <%JoshManVGH> Is that... the same voice actor...?
[5:19:40] <DSD24> Just looking at the camera
[5:19:41] <iosephe> It doesn't matter who I am, what matters is our plan
[5:19:46] <KeystoneA2> Shadow Borker
[5:19:47] <RetributionP> control because they are wrong. You just don't have the balls to accept the responsibility
[5:19:49] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt You skipped a whole lot of sidequests that are picked up only by landing on the planets
[5:19:50] <+burkey0307> shepard talking to himself
[5:19:52] <%Puhff> BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE
[5:19:54] <peachy996> And Synthesis is more in line with Saren's viewpoint
[5:19:56] <HeroToxiko> "hey imma just put my brain in this mind control machine that's actively brainwashing me as i stand here" oops im god now
[5:20:07] <%thedankestmeeme> jeez
[5:20:07] <peachy996> So in that regard the endings are fascinating
[5:20:11] <%thedankestmeeme> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[5:20:13] <DSD24> Saren is also a asshole
[5:20:14] <AmericanaRed> sbfpScared sbfpScared sbfpScared sbfpScared sbfpScared sbfpScared
[5:20:16] <Samurai_Tchan> @burkey0307 hahaahah LIKE those ventrilo pranks
[5:20:17] <%thedankestmeeme> alert
[5:20:17] <%ingman112> @peachy996 That’s what makes it so insane
[5:20:18] <%Dakuu75> chill bruh~ it's ont he to-do list XD
[5:20:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> KOHOOKOO
[5:20:25] <+TheyTookMyBeard> Sounds like Willan Sadler
[5:20:30] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt that bug on noveria for maxing out paragon and or renegade is still in the game btw
[5:20:35] <%walternatorz> Narc it up
[5:20:37] <wolverinewaswrong> I wish they did more for the shadow broker?
[5:20:42] <%thedankestmeeme> TREASON!
[5:20:51] <%bugz_munny> NARC TO THE NARCABLE
[5:20:56] <Samurai_Tchan> lalo lu lei lou
[5:21:15] <%DJFakie> Fuck the Shadow Broker, for now!
[5:21:22] <Jaysky> Honestly? Yeah.
[5:21:23] <peachy996> I just think it's neat the endings represent what 3 other characters think. I still don't like any other ending thats not Destroy
[5:21:34] <AmericanaRed> MAKE IT AN NFT
[5:21:44] <KeystoneA2> Also funny to note that the person you're talking to is also voiced by Mark Meer. He's talking to himself lol.
[5:21:45] <DSD24> Oh wow that threat
[5:21:48] <peachy996> Maybe Refuse
[5:21:51] <%DJFakie> ...And then fuck the Shadow Broker later....!
[5:21:51] <akitanito> The Shadow Borker will remember that.
[5:21:52] <%ingman112> It’s to fuck over Cerberus. You should be paying him
[5:21:53] <+pmtriox> remember when this was a thing and you didn't have to read emails like a chump?
[5:22:00] <wolverinewaswrong> Meer is the vorcha too!
[5:22:03] <Dabrikishaw> Actully, no he wont
[5:22:03] <geassguy360> Yeah well ill replace him with my Girlfriend so there
[5:22:03] <DatAsuna> yeah destroy is the only ending that feels consistent with either shepard
[5:22:04] <Mattais88> he won't care as long as you pay
[5:22:05] <+Ropcord> IT'S HAPPENING
[5:22:06] <peachy996> YAY Feros
[5:22:08] <DatAsuna> renegade or paragon
[5:22:09] <%miguelrod777> you'll be replaced soon enough Shadow broker
[5:22:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> @KeystoneA2 that happens a LOT in ME yeah
[5:22:12] <James_Quivers> The shadow broker DLC has now been deleted
[5:22:16] <DatAsuna> meer is a bunch of aliens actually
[5:22:17] <%Mantorok06> Mantorok06 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Tali is only waifu
[5:22:17] <Pookiedaexzile> WWOOOOO
[5:22:18] <+trackles_64> foreshadowing
[5:22:18] <%flechet> shit shadow brokers pulling a ckemintine
[5:22:23] <DatAsuna> but yeah he's basically every vorcha
[5:22:31] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> You've disturbed Emlo
[5:22:32] <%ingman112> I’d laugh if we suddenly pivoted to Asteroid X57
[5:22:40] <peachy996> Onto the most overlooked piece of Salarian lore
[5:22:43] <DatAsuna> vorcha were fun in MP
[5:22:46] <Samurai_Tchan> planet logan paul
[5:22:53] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> KISS DAT CAT
[5:23:02] <Dabrikishaw> Man, fuck ExoGeni
[5:23:05] <peachy996> Oh man love Vorcha players in MP, they love to burn shit
[5:23:08] <thetunnelhomer> F a r t g a s Atmosphere.
[5:23:09] <%afronooch> emlo is so majestic
[5:23:11] <AmericanaRed> MEMEBER SPORE sbfpLiam
[5:23:20] <DatAsuna> mark meer is also blasto
[5:23:21] <DSD24> I loved being a Salarian in the Multiplayer
[5:23:23] <+trackles_64> capitalist colonialism
[5:23:25] <%TheFabledAble> sounds like a shit hole
[5:23:26] <Samurai_Tchan> two moons, bliimblor, and gloobix
[5:23:28] <DSD24> My favorite race in RE
[5:23:29] <%DJFakie> Jesus, I forgot Feros was a giant planet with 300 people
[5:23:29] <DSD24> ME
[5:23:35] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> How much does Elmo weigh?
[5:23:38] <%Monkeyweed21> XO Jenny
[5:23:39] <%aWanderingKaivo> @peachy996 I wonder if ME3MP is getting more active now that LE is reminding people of it
[5:23:41] <DatAsuna> why didn't we get a blasto ending?
[5:23:42] <thetunnelhomer> ME3 Multiplayer is so good. I need it t obe rereleased.
[5:23:44] <aiutare47> @peachy996 flamethrower class is the sickest, turians were always the best though
[5:23:53] <Mattais88> I forget everything about this world outside of the hub shenanigans.
[5:23:55] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> He a big boi
[5:23:56] <peachy996> Salarian Infiltrator was my main
[5:23:59] <Drunkengen> it is
[5:23:59] <+D00msDayDan> you'd think a planet covered in prothean ruins would have more people checking it out
[5:24:00] <@SSaryn> Sure fucking is.
[5:24:00] <+pmtriox> and good riddance to it
[5:24:01] <aiutare47> IT WILL NEVER COME BACK
[5:24:01] <ScreamLord> Space Corporatism is the worst corporatism
[5:24:02] <tanarath> 12lb baby
[5:24:02] <+Ropcord> this doesn't look like one of 3 prefab buildings WHAT GAME IS THIS
[5:24:02] <Gorshum> It was really fun.
[5:24:03] <%Ranryu692> it was so good
[5:24:03] <RavenicusCrow> I played so many hours of me3 mp
[5:24:03] <thetunnelhomer> It's not *dead&*
[5:24:04] <%X2Eliah> Kinda wild how there's a whole planet full of prothean skyscrapers and it's not absolutely crowded with human scientists
[5:24:04] <%afronooch> it was very fun
[5:24:05] <RavenicusCrow> I miss it
[5:24:05] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> its still pretty active actually
[5:24:05] <%bugz_munny> it was pretty sick
[5:24:07] <%DJFakie> Dude, it was pretty alright, for real.
[5:24:09] <+Ropcord> also 3 MP was great and you should be jealous
[5:24:09] <+Terrachova> we can only hope that they bring the MP to Legendary edition, would be amazing
[5:24:11] <RedPlasticCup> its not actually
[5:24:11] <%aWanderingKaivo> its not completely dead, at least it wasn't a year or so ago
[5:24:12] <RetributionP> fatmo
[5:24:12] <+trackles_64> the are working on ME3 MP remake
[5:24:13] <wolverinewaswrong> I think I had Quarian Infiltratot
[5:24:13] <Jaysky> I loved it on launch.
[5:24:14] <%thotbane> @Mattais88 So did Bioware
[5:24:14] <James_Quivers> I think people still play it, but not much
[5:24:14] <KnightOfTrousers> I didn't get many unlocks in MP,
[5:24:15] <$SGrim> Volus Biotic was the only class.
[5:24:15] <%SataruYamate> did they kill the server since LE came out?
[5:24:15] <%MidnightBurst12> It sounds like it was dope
[5:24:16] <%maenos2> me3 multiplayer was more fun than I expected
[5:24:17] <%NateyBeak> i loved playing as a collector  in that...
[5:24:17] <%X2Eliah> It was super fun. yeah. I miss it
[5:24:18] <%walternatorz> Can't you find PC matches still?
[5:24:19] <+JonathLP> It was soooo good. I'm surprised they didn't bring it back and micro transact it
[5:24:19] <James_Quivers> BUT IT WAS SO GOOD DUDE
[5:24:21] <%Ranryu692> it wasn't like, This Is The Only Game I Play good, but it was so much fun
[5:24:21] <beefcakemanthrob> me3 mulitplayer is still played
[5:24:22] <KnightOfTrousers> But I did a lot of Vanguard
[5:24:23] <%Monkeyweed21> it was way better than it had any right to be
[5:24:23] <Samurai_Tchan> why gone ? why no pirate server ?
[5:24:25] <DatAsuna> It's still active on PC original, but it needs a seperate mod from SP controller support
[5:24:26] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt They didn't bring it back for MELE?
[5:24:26] <%ingman112> It was unironically sick
[5:24:26] <Dfreddy8> YOU CAN PLAY AS A GETH PRIME
[5:24:27] <%OrangeMDT> It was pretty nice
[5:24:27] <%Dakuu75> 12 pounds, I think that's like... 1 pound "too fat", I mean it's NOT but... you know what I mean right?
[5:24:32] <thetunnelhomer> Like you can still find people playing it, just not a lot of people.
[5:24:32] <RedPlasticCup> you can totally find pc matches
[5:24:33] <tanarath> @patstaresat it's not dead or something?
[5:24:33] <%afronooch> like its not good by itselfs, but it was better than it had any right to be
[5:24:35] <beefcakemanthrob> me3 multiplayer is so amazing
[5:24:38] <JetpackMcQuack> Wave defense, loot box, repeat
[5:24:42] <CSeriesJTYPE> I feel like mass effect has waaaay more morally dubious bio experimentation going on than like, star trek
[5:24:43] <DatAsuna> So you can actually play it still, but you have to install the bad old port
[5:24:45] <geassguy360> lol ME3 MP was so good my DAD played it
[5:24:45] <%X2Eliah> You can probably still find matches, but it's nowhere near as alive / thriving as it was back then
[5:24:46] <karl_rex> Geth Juggernaut was so much fun tanking one hit KO moves
[5:24:47] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah the coolest thing was FINALLY being able to play as all the aliens
[5:24:48] <DSD24> I remember the Krogan Warlord being rad
[5:24:49] <%DJFakie> So Garrus isn't a lockpick, until he needs to be
[5:24:51] <Samurai_Tchan> Presley is the DJ
[5:24:51] <peachy996> Ah yes this Feros theme
[5:24:58] <RedPlasticCup> hey David
[5:24:59] <%QueequegTheater> Pat why not just get 3 buddies to play with
[5:24:59] <+glgzephyr> YO, Major Kyle (Biotic Cult leader) is 100% voiced by the Scab Leader in Disco Elysium @PatStaresAt
[5:25:01] <CSeriesJTYPE> between binary helix and exogeni
[5:25:03] <feefer_drunk3rland> me3 MP loot box simulator 2k11
[5:25:04] <HeroToxiko> fai dan deez nutz
[5:25:08] <%pyurient> ME multiplayer was just horde mode but it was super fun
[5:25:09] <%DJFakie> Wei Shen?
[5:25:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> WOW
[5:25:10] <$RealThiele> fandaniel?
[5:25:10] <%TheFabledAble> this sounds super suspicious
[5:25:11] <akitanito> oh lol
[5:25:11] <Gorshum> LUL
[5:25:11] <HeroToxiko> LMFAO
[5:25:11] <wolverinewaswrong> Feros is the best looking planet in the remake
[5:25:13] <$Wurmspawn> Fai Dan = Quark
[5:25:13] <%walternatorz> lol
[5:25:13] <%afronooch> rip
[5:25:16] <karl_rex> RIP
[5:25:16] <James_Quivers> EA would be making a huge bunder not bringing it back, I hope the rumors that they're considering it are true
[5:25:16] <RedPlasticCup> bye david
[5:25:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That was fucking funny
[5:25:19] <+SargentToughie> Oh man, this world's my favorite
[5:25:20] <%walternatorz> he was rather nonchalant
[5:25:23] <%bugz_munny> what a shame
[5:25:25] <Parapattern> 90% of quests in ME revolve around amoral genetic tests
[5:25:26] <TheOtherLen> elmo :D
[5:25:28] <+burkey0307> me1 jank
[5:25:28] <$renegade_blade> I remember when vorcha were ridiculously op in me3mp, because there was a bug where you could use the flamethrower and fire the reegar shotgun at the same time LUL
[5:25:29] <HeroToxiko> Meatgagged
[5:25:34] <aiutare47> ME3 multiplayer was legit just like 'Yknow all these cool characters we talk about, you can play them. You wanna be Thane? heres a drell assassin. You want to be a Geth Hunter? We got that too. Heres a volus biotic god, and a Krogan with a big ass hammer melee, go fucking wild"
[5:25:34] <%pyurient> It just should never have been necessary to get story galactic readiness
[5:25:35] <%SataruYamate> thats just barrier
[5:25:36] <DSD24> Oh man this is so different from Adept on Insanity
[5:25:38] <+Manooz> vanguard is better in me2/3
[5:25:39] <ChungusQuest> Vanguard is the fucking best
[5:25:39] <peachy996> I notice you play just as nutty as the ai does
[5:25:41] <EvanAlmighty210> what a rotten way to die
[5:25:43] <ioci2112> just run straight into bullets, what could go wrong
[5:25:44] <%derpy_platypus> pat has awoken to Vangaurd
[5:25:44] <+trackles_64> the husks are annoying af on insanity
[5:25:47] <RavenicusCrow> Naughty geth
[5:25:52] <karl_rex> Schlorp
[5:25:53] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt This part gives me huge Jade Empire vibes. Specifically the Great Southern Forest and the creepy cannibal cult
[5:25:54] <%thotbane> wait was it deathmatch or was it all just PvE
[5:25:54] <DatAsuna> But yeah the main thing about ME3 MP was just how long it was supported and how many crazy exclusive things they added to it that aren't in SP
[5:25:55] <DSD24> These enemies never came back
[5:25:55] <$hattrick61> "ehhh vanguards shit chat"
[5:25:58] <Samurai_Tchan> OH NO the sexual geth
[5:25:59] <Pookiedaexzile> even more nutss when you start throwing bitches
[5:26:00] <James_Quivers> Rule 34 Geth
[5:26:01] <+spartanluchador534> the worst enemy type
[5:26:03] <thetunnelhomer> ME3MP's best part is playing as the aliens.
[5:26:04] <%JoshManVGH> Legendary Leveling has added a lot to this game.
[5:26:05] <$SGrim> Ah yes, Frogeth
[5:26:08] <peachy996> It was PVE
[5:26:09] <%Ynkubus_> That geth needs some pants
[5:26:10] <DatAsuna> nobody mentioned the guy whose melee is just a crossbow
[5:26:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> @James_Quivers For real, I'd love to get the chance to play it more with an active player base and unlock more stuff
[5:26:16] <DatAsuna> or the nuke trip mines
[5:26:20] <thetunnelhomer> Krogan Vanguard is the actual best.
[5:26:20] <peachy996> MP would be so toxic if it was pvp lol
[5:26:22] <capjordo> ABSOLUTE UNIT
[5:26:24] <%DJFakie> Asari Adept was a fun time
[5:26:26] <%AzureGale> LENS FLARE
[5:26:26] <HeroToxiko> i despise the frog bois
[5:26:27] <wolverinewaswrong> Most improved planet in the remake
[5:26:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> Like even if they just ported it as it exists in old ME3 without updates
[5:26:29] <CSeriesJTYPE> everything does
[5:26:29] <Mattais88> Spider Geth, Spider Geth, Does whatever a spider geth does
[5:26:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> das pretty good
[5:26:33] <+poysendemon> the dude with electro whips was sick
[5:26:36] <hat_under_bread> I guess they put extra effort into the main missions.
[5:26:36] <peachy996> Well that's an improvement
[5:26:39] <+trackles_64> the Cain is the best weapon
[5:26:42] <%thotbane> they should just release a game based around the multiplayer
[5:26:43] <+mcjimbles> Anyone see that video where Garrus ascends?
[5:26:47] <capjordo> I want some geth ass
[5:26:47] <AmericanaRed> YO!! MIAMI 305
[5:26:50] <+mlow44> Not really a Vanguard thing, running into bullets is also an Infiltrator thing too. This level is where I slap explosive rounds into my sniper and noscope plantboys
[5:26:52] <Explodincatz> nice HL2 area
[5:26:56] <peachy996> Yeah Ledra!
[5:26:57] <%DJFakie> Femshep talking to herself, potentially
[5:26:57] <DatAsuna> @aWanderingKaivo you can actually cheatengine yourself infinite MP credits and unlock everything on pc
[5:27:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn
[5:27:02] <%ingman112> Was that Mercer?
[5:27:05] <Ranger747> like a kingsom hearts enemy
[5:27:06] <+pmtriox> I wouldn't say better, the textures are better but that color pisses me off
[5:27:08] <karl_rex> Geth Juggernaut was immune to One hit KOs and was just enormous
[5:27:11] <Samurai_Tchan> LIORA
[5:27:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mcjimbles no i need to see it tho got a link?
[5:27:12] <peachy996> Talk to Ledra when you can
[5:27:17] <+glgzephyr> that's always my play order
[5:27:21] <peachy996> Same
[5:27:21] <%ingman112> Yep yep
[5:27:27] <thetunnelhomer> Getting Liara last is hilarous
[5:27:34] <Jaysky> That's what I did in my OG
[5:27:34] <aiutare47> the reason why they wont add in ME3 MP is Servers, severs cost money to maintain and keep up. I doubt EA cares enough to go through the trouble
[5:27:34] <%ingman112> Virmire should only ever be last
[5:27:36] <$Wurmspawn> Pay attention to that Salarian. When I played through this on PS4 that Salarian will end up leaving his position later, but his omni-tool will still be there floating in the air.
[5:27:36] <ScreamLord> They're being an Aliens on Noveria
[5:27:43] <+trackles_64> they are chilling out on Noveria
[5:27:48] <+pmtriox> remember that? remember when the quest log ACTUALLY WORKED?
[5:27:54] <%Extrallent> But Virmire has all those business people to fuck over
[5:27:56] <+mcjimbles> @cobalt_phoenix_ one sec I’m on my phone I’ll find it
[5:28:08] <DatAsuna> @aiutare47 except ME3 MP is still playable right now.

[5:28:19] <$Wurmspawn> Hi Quark!
[5:28:26] <aiutare47> Well never fucking mind EA are hacks
[5:28:27] <Samurai_Tchan> s.lw
[5:28:28] <DatAsuna> it's just trapped behind a bad ME3 port that needs mods for gamepad support
[5:28:28] <susukouhai> is elmo just sraing at gief

[5:28:39] <+trackles_64> slaughter the colony

[5:29:01] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Headshots matter in ME1 now
[5:29:04] <geassguy360> *enables barrier, then takes cover*
[5:29:07] <RushUnplugged> sniper rifles? who needs them
[5:29:09] <$Wurmspawn> @mcjimbles Only clip links from what I've seen.
[5:29:10] <Pookiedaexzile> THis is still a shooter pat
[5:29:17] <%Rumbutt> You have the cutscene pistol now oroLUL
[5:29:22] <Samurai_Tchan> actually the most fun class is soldier, you can deal a bunch of damage
[5:29:24] <+trackles_64> a postol is not a Sniper pat XD
[5:29:27] <%ingman112> If this was the Disco LP chat would be going “Hmmm protect the HEART of the colony HMMMMMM SUS SUS”
[5:29:28] <HeroToxiko> Katana traps the souls of whoever it kills
[5:29:33] <ChungusQuest> Triple Bitch! Overbitch! Bitchtacular!
[5:29:34] <%aWanderingKaivo> AI is like"yes, let me make this shield cover, and step out of it immediately"
[5:29:37] <%DJFakie> @trackles_64 In this game it is
[5:29:38] <%ArcanumArcanum> lol wrong way

[5:29:59] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt Wrex reminds me of Rusty from LA Noire with his voice
[5:30:00] <mak0t0yukii> The geth did nothing wrong leave em alone
[5:30:05] <DatAsuna> "i will destroy you!"
[5:30:10] <peachy996> Dig up stupid
[5:30:14] <akitanito> I like to think that they kept her alive until you showed up
[5:30:14] <RushUnplugged> a sniper rifle is just a pistol with extra junk on it
[5:30:21] <%thotbane> shut up lizards
[5:30:23] <+pmtriox> mp
[5:30:24] <%DJFakie> They want you to stop the attack first
[5:30:24] <peachy996> Take the hint

[5:31:28] <wolverinewaswrong> cool looking highway tho
[5:31:33] <%Taisuru> Did gief blast that last nut finally?
[5:31:36] <peachy996> Ilos you always remember
[5:31:42] <Pookiedaexzile> That last shot is still cooking
[5:31:44] <capjordo> @aiutare47 the correct one
[5:31:44] <Mattais88> There's plant stuff, I remember that much
[5:31:48] <DatAsuna> that'd be cause feros is a lot of running around brown corridors
[5:31:50] <+pmtriox> I like the old textures better, I could actually see
[5:31:50] <+storkeylope> Im gonna be honest, my brain always autocorrects peewee to peepee
[5:31:51] <HeroToxiko> @aiutare47 peebee isn't a genocide supporter
[5:32:03] <%X2Eliah> Feros has a lot of corridor bs
[5:32:05] <peachy996> To me this is the first real starter mission so I always remember this one
[5:32:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Wiped from my mind
[5:32:08] <RushUnplugged> Vanguard baybee
[5:32:09] <+storkeylope> Peebee*
[5:32:13] <%DJFakie> Barrier is the Immunity for shields
[5:32:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Warp
[5:32:25] <capjordo> She just wants remnant data cores and space dick she’s best waifu
[5:32:25] <JetpackMcQuack> I think i was attacked by dogs on feros
[5:32:30] <peachy996> Now go back down and talk to the people
[5:32:34] <peachy996> All the people
[5:32:39] <tanarath> Is pat on heroic?
[5:32:40] <%thotbane> @peachy996 THe mako should be reserved for side planets not actual content planets
[5:32:43] <DatAsuna> Tali is kinda complicated by the very unsubtle israel/palestine allegory
[5:32:43] <+pmtriox> they don't scale main missions to your level so they tend to be slightly easier
[5:32:46] <%maenos2> @jetpackmcquack the sharkdogs are here yeah
[5:32:48] <%Taisuru> gg
[5:32:49] <Pookiedaexzile> MASTER
[5:32:51] <%thotbane> the mako should be reserved for a garbage can
[5:32:56] <%dekkitout> Become as wall
[5:32:57] <Pookiedaexzile> BARRIER
[5:32:57] <Mattais88> shotty for more damage?
[5:33:05] <%DJFakie> On Normal you're basically untouchable now, yeah.
[5:33:06] <ianabstract> master barrier
[5:33:08] <ianabstract> I see
[5:33:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Become as Tank
[5:33:15] <+athuramn> 1k points on barrier. they might have gone a little overboard
[5:33:17] <tanarath> Lift
[5:33:18] <%DJFakie> Foregoing any attacks that bypass shield, like melees.
[5:33:18] <%aWanderingKaivo> get the big carnage
[5:33:20] <%ArcanumArcanum> max shotgun for damage. Or level up Lift
[5:33:20] <RushUnplugged> spectre?
[5:33:24] <peachy996> Dump it into lift
[5:33:25] <$Wurmspawn> Spectre training?
[5:33:30] <%X2Eliah> spectre tren?
[5:33:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Lift and Warp
[5:33:32] <Dfreddy8> EMBRACE ETERNITY
[5:33:35] <peachy996> Lift is hilarious near the end game
[5:33:39] <%SataruYamate> do lift, because it works at long range, dunno why youve had problems with it
[5:33:40] <CrypticMochi> Better lift means stronger enemies can be lifted
[5:33:44] <DatAsuna> I don't think people in 2021 will be quite as receptive to such an obvious allegory as they were in 2007
[5:33:46] <%ingman112> I say go intimidate for fun renegade options
[5:33:52] <%DJFakie> Fitness gives Wrex Immunity
[5:34:05] <HeroToxiko> the most hilarious thing about andromeda ewas the fact that small robot enemy debris had a unique animation
[5:34:09] <DatAsuna> but it's kind of a live wire topic irl as is
[5:34:12] <RushUnplugged> a Shepat if you will
[5:34:14] <aiutare47> Why would we want a trailer park shepard?
[5:34:16] <JetpackMcQuack> ill write that down
[5:34:16] <Parapattern> No one wants that
[5:34:21] <DSD24> Make a cool Alter version of Pat
[5:34:23] <%QueequegTheater> Okay but how do I enter the code so it gives me the complete opposite
[5:34:24] <%Arancet> its ok, i dont need a shepat
[5:34:27] <Pookiedaexzile> We don't cept for the photo ops
[5:34:29] <%ingman112> @datasuna Cut to Woolie painstakingly explaining the conflict to chat trolls
[5:34:29] <@SSaryn> LUL
[5:34:30] <kashmir1213> I want that
[5:34:31] <%TheFabledAble> we love you pat
[5:34:32] <Parapattern> LUL
[5:34:34] <%ArcanumArcanum> chat deserves it
[5:34:36] <%TheFabledAble> <3 <3 <3
[5:34:36] <@SSaryn> That's why.
[5:34:36] <acridpaladin> cause
[5:34:36] <capjordo> @herotoxiko best physics, best cover shooter mechanics
[5:34:37] <+D00msDayDan> is that new in LE? i know ME1's character creator didn't let you plug in a code
[5:34:37] <%AzureGale> I see cat is cool with gun being ponted at him
[5:34:37] <%Taisuru> Nobody wants tall pat
[5:34:37] <DSD24> Its cause we are CHAT
[5:34:38] <%cvp5127> fuck you pat
[5:34:39] <%MaraSmug> My shepat was too short to reach the panel at the end of mass effect 3 and the reapers won
[5:34:40] <arkv01> cause the hatesex is so good uncle pat
[5:34:40] <peachy996> cuz
[5:34:40] <RetributionP> I don't want a pat Shepard
[5:34:42] <aiutare47> Dont make characters that looks like a sex offender
[5:34:42] <$Wurmspawn> Cause that's no fun?
[5:34:42] <Profmcstevie> You inspire it in us
[5:34:42] <+pmtriox> we didn't start the fire on that one pat
[5:34:43] <illtima> Good words, Pat. Proud of you.
[5:34:44] <%Rumbutt> Plenty of people want french Shepat
[5:34:44] <Gorshum> <3
[5:34:46] <%Ranryu692> We learned it from watching you
[5:34:46] <%Monkeyweed21> you first
[5:34:47] <Dfreddy8> If I wanted to make a Pat Shepard I would make him a Volus.
[5:34:47] <%QueequegTheater> Pat, this is nothing compared to funnier people like RussianBadger
[5:34:48] <%Kitafin> but we do be nice
[5:34:49] <tanarath> We CAN good nice be.
[5:34:50] <battlexqueen> idk pat why cant i nice be
[5:34:51] <NeroInfinite> because pat
[5:34:53] <%walternatorz> do I have permission to non stop dance as Pat-shep?
[5:34:55] <%dekkitout> I wouldn't trust Shepat to not spill a surprise party- cause he's a narc you see
[5:34:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Because you fuck
[5:34:58] <+dariusclover> its to show we care pat
[5:34:59] <susukouhai> cuz girls are watching pat
[5:35:03] <+cafefunk> Why not a fem Pat
[5:35:04] <%Taisuru> psaPorgmo
[5:35:09] <%SkyfireHero> I already did, but I made you blonde
[5:35:12] <ChungusQuest> Armin?
[5:35:16] <%AzureGale> We didn't start the fire. It was always burning since the world's been turning
[5:35:19] <RushUnplugged> Pat we're too busy arguing with each other than shit-talk you
[5:35:19] <%emperordread> Armin SHimmerman
[5:35:19] <$Wurmspawn> I've been saying that since you landed.
[5:35:21] <%Ranryu692> oh yeah
[5:35:21] <arkv01> lemme hear it again
[5:35:22] <DatAsuna> @ingman112 Woolie is great but after the third time it should have been clear the guy had no interest in dealing with nuance or arguing in good faith.
[5:35:22] <%Nekros4442> @cafefunk Pat plays himself
[5:35:24] <%Ravioli_Ronin> I would love to have Uncle Shep creeping out my crew
[5:35:25] <%Ranryu692> I can hear it
[5:35:26] <Pookiedaexzile> If I saw Uncle Shepat I'd think he sold meth and I'd be right
[5:35:28] <tanarath> Armin was chill
[5:35:29] <RLT917> its is
[5:35:45] <RLT917> he voices a few random npc's
[5:35:45] <%ingman112> @datasuna 100%
[5:35:51] <%QueequegTheater> Man now I'm thinking about Erwin's speech from the dub of AoT
[5:35:53] <DatAsuna> [insert miscellaneous pat shit talk here]
[5:35:54] <Profmcstevie> I think you mean an army of EXP
[5:35:55] <%QueequegTheater> That shit ruled
[5:35:57] <capjordo> Just finished reading end of AOT manga and I’m hurt
[5:35:59] <Mattais88> You mean Principal Snyder?
[5:36:01] <arkv01> god bless quark
[5:36:07] <arkv01> still in the business
[5:36:13] <DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater dub erwin is god tier
[5:36:22] <+pmtriox> NOW you go down to that area
[5:36:24] <aiutare47> @DatAsuna You mean the guy with the twitch username "Benjamin Goldstein" that called Woolie an anti semite was a troll?
[5:36:25] <NitronStreams> weird hearing Quark not being a scumbag
[5:36:43] <DatAsuna> Dub Grisha is similarly lowkey better than JP
[5:36:55] <%QueequegTheater> AoT is so weird because the dub is overall kind of just decent but some voices are so completely above the JP voices it's insane
[5:37:02] <$Wurmspawn> Gonna catch up on the Vod later. I need to head to bed for now. G'night.
[5:37:07] <%QueequegTheater> Like Grisha and Erwin
[5:37:12] <%QueequegTheater> And even Levi IMO
[5:37:28] <DatAsuna> I think Levi is just about even voicewise
[5:37:33] <peachy996> Gee Fai Dan why are you so tranquil
[5:37:35] <CSeriesJTYPE> is it stallone time
[5:37:45] <%thotbane> @capjordo I feel like the epilogue chapter is dogshit, but the overall ending is fine. If i went back in time and told 2013 me how it would all end, and that last panel on the penultimate chapter, i'd go "yeah, checks out"
[5:37:49] <%SaiyanShoto> Elmo is looking into my soul psaElmo psaElmo
[5:37:53] <%QueequegTheater> Dub Erwin is believable as a man that can convince the scouts to do that big spoiler thing in Season 3
[5:38:00] <Parapattern> Elmo is Looking
[5:38:05] <+CptBritches> Elmo sees us
[5:38:07] <DatAsuna> oh now i recognise fai dan's voice
[5:38:11] <%DJFakie> BTW Shredder and Tungsten stop dropping after Rank 7 so consider saving one each
[5:38:15] <HeroToxiko> SPACE FEUDALISM LUL
[5:38:15] <+trackles_64> slavery
[5:38:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Space Croppers
[5:38:21] <%QueequegTheater> Elmo has judged chat's potential and found us lacking
[5:38:31] <%Arancet> elmo posing for his portait
[5:38:37] <%Ranryu692> it's like Elmo is looking directly into my soul
[5:38:40] <%AzureGale> mmm can you smell the passive-aggression
[5:38:45] <akitanito> is this the blade not opening eyes scene
[5:38:45] <laughinjester> first time popping into a stream, but wow elmo is a big kitty
[5:38:48] <%dekkitout> @QueequegTheater More like Cat Stares At tajC
[5:38:49] <capjordo> @thotbane I loved the ending to AOT overall there were just a lot of pain points and unanswered questions for me
[5:38:49] <%ElkRiverDog> ElkRiverDog extended their Tier 1 subscription through July! 
[5:38:50] <tranquilturnip> :|
[5:38:50] <+Ropcord> elmp
[5:38:50] <murdocismyhero> Put her down
[5:38:53] <capjordo> Loved it tho
[5:38:56] <%bugz_munny> this looks terrible
[5:38:57] <%Ranryu692> Elmo's blinking at us,that means he loves chat!
[5:39:02] <DatAsuna> This colony has big jade empire vibes too
[5:39:04] <akitanito> you missed
[5:39:06] <%QueequegTheater> CAT STARES AT LUL
[5:39:07] <peachy996> Gee Blake why are you in such pain
[5:39:11] <CrypticMochi> @djfakie I remember reading they changed that for LE
[5:39:15] <DSD24> I never did even as a Renegade
[5:39:16] <DatAsuna> the cannibal teahouse
[5:39:16] <Mattais88> She sounds like shes thirty years younger than she looks
[5:39:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> its pretty bad
[5:39:18] <akitanito> remind me
[5:39:21] <%MaraSmug> Whats the renegade option?
[5:39:21] <+pmtriox> you mean where you deliberately kill everyone?
[5:39:23] <+Kindan55> Probably
[5:39:24] <KeystoneA2> Almost
[5:39:25] <%Rumbutt> just kill em all, take off and nuke the place from orbit
[5:39:27] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp Zombies
[5:39:32] <%MaraSmug> monkaS
[5:39:32] <$Faustgesicht> yeah
[5:39:33] <aiutare47> Pat remember you need to do the last part solo if you dont want your crew to mow down the innocents
[5:39:33] <%aWanderingKaivo> "No I just don't want to"
[5:39:35] <RavenicusCrow> I had no idea quark was in video games. Just looked it up and he was andrew ryan in bioshock too
[5:39:37] <capjordo> At least it ended as epic as I hoped it would
[5:39:41] <KeystoneA2> The option on Samara's daughter is legit murder
[5:39:42] <%ingman112> But pat THERE’S NO TIME
[5:39:42] <%thotbane> Is this the plant one?
[5:39:43] <%DJFakie> Melee counts for KOs in that part, by the way! WAY easier.
[5:39:44] <DatAsuna> well not too soon
[5:39:48] <%QueequegTheater> @aiutare47 not true
[5:39:52] <KeystoneA2> Not Morinth, mind you
[5:39:55] <%ingman112> WE HAVE A GALAXY TO KILL I MEAN SAVE
[5:39:58] <Mattais88> Eat a VARREN? THAT'S FUCKING HARDCORE
[5:39:58] <JetpackMcQuack> i can kill him
[5:39:59] <aiutare47> Was that fixed?
[5:39:59] <tranquilturnip> i have a shit
[5:40:00] <+samiscoolbro> It’s not close to worst renegade option pat
[5:40:03] <%SataruYamate> i mean, they do give you a really convenient way to not be renegade
[5:40:15] <%QueequegTheater> It was never broken in the old game?
[5:40:17] <aiutare47> @QueequegTheater I remember them shooting them, was it fixed?
[5:40:30] <Pookiedaexzile> "Don't help us with your fast quiet ship, we don't need food kill the enemy"
[5:40:32] <peachy996> Gee you're acting suspicious Davin, why is that
[5:40:49] <%DJFakie> The sun was in my eyes, and I shot my neighbor!
[5:40:53] <aiutare47> maybe im totally misremembering but I thought for sure I had to do that part without crew because theyd shoot automatically
[5:40:56] <%QueequegTheater> @aiutare47 I never ran into the problem as long as I told them not to shoot
[5:41:03] <DatAsuna> he said the thing
[5:41:04] <+pmtriox> oh hi smokey femshep
[5:41:07] <%miguelrod777> evee
[5:41:09] <aiutare47> maybe I had a bug or something
[5:41:18] <%thotbane> what's that VAs name
[5:41:21] <%thotbane> that woman
[5:41:27] <%thotbane> who else is she

[5:41:42] <%thotbane> Oh duh, she's just doin that other voice she does
[5:41:43] <%DJFakie> That glitch happened for me too
[5:41:44] <Pookiedaexzile> YEYEYEYYEYEYEEYE
[5:41:46] <peachy996> Ask him about his name
[5:41:46] <NeroInfinite> umm LUL
[5:41:53] <capjordo> RASP
[5:41:54] <CSeriesJTYPE> DONT LOOK AT THAT
[5:41:57] <peachy996> Salarian Names are so cool
[5:41:59] <%QueequegTheater> Jen Hale is 1/3 of all female voices
[5:41:59] <JetpackMcQuack> but why
[5:42:00] <Jaysky> I too will stay here.
[5:42:08] <+trackles_64> killl the dog's

[5:42:10] <+drawdehellfire> Thanks Allegra Chicken, you're my favorite character <3
[5:42:12] <%Puhff> rip
[5:42:15] <Jaysky> Perhaps we should all stay here chat.
[5:42:18] <%StaceMcGate> drink the kool-aid Shepard
[5:42:20] <frostyjay3> I can't unsee his arm
[5:42:22] <HeroToxiko> His answer: cuz im a coward
[5:42:25] <capjordo> No shut up it’s fine
[5:42:26] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> These guys are greys and look like the chinese aliens from the Star Wars Prequels
[5:42:26] <CSeriesJTYPE> whats wrong with your FAAAACE
[5:42:35] <%ingman112> This place is great guys. I feel like staying here too
[5:42:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey this place doesnt seem too bad
[5:42:40] <%DJFakie> Uhhhhh, Shepard?
[5:42:43] <+pmtriox> I try to like this remaster, I try to. but its like they insert a new splinter into the wound as they try to fix things like this. and fail utterly
[5:42:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> I like how you can see differences in different models for the aliens, his face is kind of wider than other salarians, skin not mottled, etc
[5:42:52] <JetpackMcQuack> good dodge
[5:42:58] <Jaysky> @cobalt_phoenix_ It is a very good place for reasonable people to live forever.
[5:43:05] <DSD24> Salarian's are so cool
[5:43:07] <jojoagain> I had that glitch in the xbox version
[5:43:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Whats your name, RACE"
[5:43:15] <Detrius25> Darn Catholics
[5:43:17] <DatAsuna> @ingman112 random aside, but is your name a metroid prime 2 thing?
[5:43:17] <Mattais88> Salarian nameing backstory
[5:43:21] <peachy996> Never mentioned again that Salarians have full FULL FULL names
[5:43:22] <%Gimmpy2143> Gimmpy2143 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! help my cat wont stop laying on my stomach
[5:43:23] <+EternalJedi> so their name is their address
[5:43:27] <tanarath> It super is
[5:43:27] <+pmtriox> now if only that ever came up again
[5:43:29] <aiutare47> Is this ever referred to again?
[5:43:34] <peachy996> One of my fav tidbits about Salarians
[5:43:35] <%dekkitout> Pretty easy to follow nomenclature
[5:43:41] <%bugz_munny> THE FIRST OF HIS NAME
[5:43:41] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! Hey Pat, finished moving into my own place 3 days ago, its my first time completely on my own. Been catching up to your ME1 streams while cleaning and unpacking. Never realized how racist Ashley was since I played this back then when I was a dumb teen.
[5:43:42] <HeroToxiko> don't need an id if everything is your name
[5:43:46] <+sabertoothzombie> so what if they move?
[5:43:51] <James_Quivers> Hello my name is 32 Wallaby Way Sidney
[5:43:52] <aiutare47> I dont remember another salarian having a long name ever again
[5:43:59] <%aWanderingKaivo> what if that's just the naming convention on his one weirdo planet and other salarians don't follow it
[5:44:04] <%thotbane> Why is there a picture of the BOX and not of the gun?
[5:44:09] <CheekyBirb> if it's not katana, i ain't want it
[5:44:10] <tanarath> Just save for spectre & endgame stuff
[5:44:15] <Dabrikishaw> You get better gear fast on Legendary Mode
[5:44:18] <$Faustgesicht> What if you're homeless?
[5:44:20] <%ingman112> @datasuna Not in the slightest actually, I only played 1 and 3. My last name is ing and it was a childhood nickname
[5:44:33] <Dfreddy8> The only things worth buying are the licenses
[5:44:41] <peachy996> If you're a homeless Salarian you're probably on Omega
[5:44:43] <DatAsuna> dang, odd coincidence in that light lol
[5:44:51] <%thotbane> >choker
[5:44:54] <capjordo> Does he sell any space converses
[5:45:02] <$Faustgesicht> @peachy996 Fair
[5:45:05] <+trackles_64> suss
[5:45:08] <DSD24> I am so sick of Fai Den
[5:45:17] <peachy996> I think it's mentioned a particular group of Salarian live there, Lystheni
[5:45:20] <capjordo> Space choker
[5:45:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> kill fai dan
[5:45:37] <NeroInfinite> I like how shep's suit is just flashing danger

[5:45:45] <+D00msDayDan> man i did not pick up on how damn suspicious everyone was my first time playing this when i was like 16
[5:46:05] <peachy996> He even has noticable ears
[5:46:06] <Detrius25> Same lol
[5:46:08] <%ingman112> @datasuna Yeah what’s the reference? I just tried looking it up but didn’t see anything
[5:46:12] <+pmtriox> and WATER dingus
[5:46:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh you real close fucking close alright
[5:46:13] <+poysendemon> she needs to chill
[5:46:20] <%X2Eliah> water lady
[5:46:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> you know putting aside what's actually going on, it kind of seems like Feros is a weird Fai Dan cult at first
[5:46:24] <%X2Eliah> talk to water lady too
[5:46:28] <TarTelperion> test
[5:46:32] <tanarath> Isn't there a water quest too?

[5:46:37] <+pmtriox> jen hale
[5:46:44] <+pmtriox> you kinda dipped out on her
[5:46:49] <aiutare47> The mechanic lady I think
[5:46:50] <DatAsuna> @ingman112 the main threat of prime is an enemy type called the Ing that possess people
[5:46:50] <%DJFakie> By the pipes near the entrance
[5:46:55] <+pmtriox> no

[5:47:23] <tonfirean> I didn't ask for this.
[5:47:23] <+EternalJedi> limesD she didn't ask for this
[5:47:23] <James_Quivers> I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS
[5:47:28] <trianglehat> I didn't ask for this
[5:47:32] <peachy996> Why are you acting like such an ass?
[5:47:32] <capjordo> Chuffing on her space ciggys
[5:47:40] <%MrBorisMakarov> that's fair
[5:47:42] <peachy996> Oh that's why

[5:50:14] <illtima> He'll do it again
[5:50:15] <+Buzzkill983> I read a theory that the Citadel has a minor indoctrination field that causes people to believe Reapers aren't real and that's why the Council sucks
[5:50:17] <%Taisuru> Fuck im up elmo
[5:50:19] <capjordo> ASK FAI DAN FUCKER

[5:50:50] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Just ran Diamond EX with a BLM that out-DPSed the boss, I didn't even know that was possible
[5:50:50] <Detrius25> It is sad how good this is compared to three.
[5:50:50] <Parapattern> He touch gently
[5:50:54] <%QueequegTheater> Fucking turret god

[5:51:04] <+thecosmicfly> TOS
[5:51:04] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[5:51:05] <Detrius25> DA BEST BABY
[5:51:08] <+cubbywolf> that was three days ago but he's fibe
[5:51:09] <%Axellogic> beating the children on stream with soft touching
[5:51:10] <arkv01> don't leave screws lying around duh
[5:51:11] <capjordo> @cubbywolf nailed it
[5:51:14] <%pyurient> my friends cat ate a needle the other day
[5:51:19] <%Dakuu75> didn't know cats could get Pica
[5:51:20] <%walternatorz> sounds like you got the wrong thread pitch for your model
[5:51:26] <%emperordread> Who here didn't swallow metal as a baby?
[5:51:29] <%dekkitout> Ate a screw? What was he, a nut?
[5:51:30] <laughinjester> my cat plays with anything, but doesn't eat it
[5:51:33] <Mattais88> All my cat ever ate was heads of frogs. Just the heads. He'd leave the bodies on the porch.
[5:51:38] <+cubbywolf> birst time ebery bime
[5:51:44] <capjordo> @dekkitout nice
[5:51:46] <DatAsuna> @Buzzkill983 tbh the reason I hate theories like that or the "asari have no real form we can see" theory people is that they're reaching for magical conspiracy answers to explain sociological phenomena
[5:51:47] <laughinjester> @dekkitout LUL
[5:51:52] <dero45> you passed a terminal when you came in that tunnel
[5:51:57] <Detrius25> Spectre powers are so OP LUL
[5:51:58] <%maenos2> @mattais88 my brothers cat does similar but with squirrels.  good to know she isn't the only one.
[5:52:04] <%ingman112> Pat the fear in your voice is palpable
[5:52:07] <jorniev> you know what the best version of a disgruntled settler that just wants help i have ever seen? GRETA from the s4 of castlevania, she just wants to make sure the people helping her are 100% willing to help instead of being an asshole about it
[5:52:15] <%SataruYamate> i got a pretty annoying bug here, my squad would always get stuck in the tunnels and i had to fight all encounters on my own
[5:52:17] <aiutare47> @Buzzkill983 I always thought it just sounds outlandish, like if the US' top Green Beret kept reporting to the president that "No man Im serious the Chinese are working with the aliens" after every single mission we'd just assume theyre crazy
[5:52:26] <DatAsuna> It's like how the clone wars show retconned order 66 to be magic mind control chips instead of a matter of social deference to authority
[5:52:28] <$Futurecity10> on console its darker than shit in these tunnels
[5:52:30] <+BlackSunEmperor> i love how mysterious the Feros track is
[5:52:37] <+pmtriox> @Buzzkill983 or just ideas they were too lazy to think thorugh
[5:52:40] <DatAsuna> The magic mind control chips are just far less interesting
[5:52:49] <+cubbywolf> what class is patron?
[5:52:54] <%aWanderingKaivo> @DatAsuna it also kind of reminds me of star wars EU after the fact made up justification for things in the movies
[5:52:56] <%TheFabledAble> so the vibe i am getting is that this colony is cursed
[5:53:00] <%maenos2> vanguard
[5:53:01] <%X2Eliah> manguard
[5:53:09] <Mattais88> @maenos2 There's a bit of a size difference between a squirrel and a frog.
[5:53:13] <JetpackMcQuack> they take two :(
[5:53:18] <+cubbywolf> best class
[5:53:27] <Detrius25> LUL
[5:53:31] <+Buzzkill983> So Pat started blasting
[5:53:34] <%maenos2> @mattais88 true.
[5:53:39] <dero45> gravity the ultimate destroyer
[5:53:50] <+cubbywolf> poor Sheperd is bald in this sci fi universe. must be a fashion choice
[5:54:00] <42nfl19> Wait did the Geth hire the Krogan?
[5:54:17] <aiutare47> @42nfl19 Saren did I think
[5:54:19] <+cubbywolf> we can mass effect but can we not bald frfr
[5:54:20] <%aWanderingKaivo> Like "R2D2 didn't use his thrusters in the OT because the company went out of business" like cmon. They made up the thrusters for the prequel, we all know it
[5:54:20] <%X2Eliah> Saren hired the kroggos
[5:54:21] <$Faustgesicht> Incendiary 6 down one more
[5:54:22] <+pmtriox> Polonium is outlawed by the geneva conventions as a weapon
[5:54:24] <peachy996> The Krogan have a deal with Saren
[5:54:26] <DatAsuna> @aWanderingKaivo EU did far less of that and far more just derivative worldbuilding that shrank the scope of the world while being a lot of heavy handed callbacks
[5:54:27] <%ingman112> Nah you still got the VI rounds
[5:54:30] <dero45> @cubbywolf all the renegading in his younger years
[5:54:38] <peachy996> Involves the Genophage
[5:54:40] <peachy996> Fight da big varren that makes all of da rules
[5:54:44] <Detrius25> manmagic+realmagic
[5:54:45] <Parapattern> You think Rex would have a bit of a problem with blowing away members of his dwindling species.
[5:54:50] <DatAsuna> Like deciding han solo should be the model correlian and all correlians should be variants of his personality
[5:54:57] <trianglehat> doggo
[5:55:00] <dero45> dey comin

[5:56:02] <+cubbywolf> ooh shiiit i just flashed back to playing this mission as soon as you went around the corner
[5:56:04] <%X2Eliah> This part of Feros *sucks*

[5:56:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> NOOOO
[5:56:13] <dero45> just chillin
[5:56:15] <%dekkitout> "My miiiiind!"
[5:56:16] <%AzureGale> DED?
[5:56:17] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna well it's just a different but also annoying thing when writers pick up someone else's work but don't want to stray too far from it.
[5:56:17] <Dfreddy8> Power cells
[5:56:25] <Mattais88> Tweaking on red sand

[5:57:21] <DatAsuna> @aWanderingKaivo I would actually say a better comparison for that would be say, fallout 3. Cross the entire continent and all that's there is watered down versions of the west coast factions.

[5:58:46] <HeroToxiko> context clues lead me to think fai dan has some kinda running man bomb colar thing
[5:58:47] <+cubbywolf> horrifying for them but another sunday for the thing
[5:58:48] <42nfl19> So is @PatStaresAt overleveled? or was it the new XP balance they did in the Remaster?
[5:58:54] <+trackles_64> I just ordered pizza
[5:58:58] <dero45> the battery from the car wreck
[5:58:59] <DatAsuna> it would be pretty dumb if this was all leading up to shepard becoming some kind of space ghost that not only controlled an entire machine race but by extension had indoctrination powers

[6:00:57] <%ingman112> @patstaresat “Joke’s on you I was only pretending”
[6:01:00] <%StaceMcGate> can you increase the game difficulty?
[6:01:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Geth Detstoryer? more Like Geth Deez Nuts
[6:01:05] <Detrius25> Just a tad
[6:01:07] <%lildashots> You miss the joke and therefore aren't affected by it psaLiz
[6:01:08] <peachy996> Yeah
[6:01:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> pretty much
[6:01:08] <%QueequegTheater> Yes
[6:01:08] <GustauveVIII> YES
[6:01:09] <beefcakemanthrob> yep
[6:01:09] <aiutare47> kinda?
[6:01:10] <Ardailec> Yeaqh
[6:01:10] <thetunnelhomer> YUP
[6:01:10] <%Rumbutt> Yeah pretty much
[6:01:11] <James_Quivers> HELL YEAH
[6:01:11] <DSD24> In 3 yes
[6:01:12] <Jaysky> It can get nutty
[6:01:13] <RushUnplugged> Vanguard in me3 is an unstoppable hurricane of death
[6:01:13] <tanarath> YES
[6:01:13] <dero45> insanity not so broken but still broken
[6:01:14] <bharcoot> Yeah
[6:01:14] <%Arancet> all in
[6:01:15] <$SGrim> Yes
[6:01:15] <%dekkitout> What kind of DBZ character?
[6:01:17] <Mattais88> Yeah, I can see it
[6:01:17] <James_Quivers> YOU GET A SICK SHOCKWAVE
[6:01:18] <RushUnplugged> and then you start shooting
[6:01:19] <Ardailec> Lots of Dragon Rushing
[6:01:20] <peachy996> Charge and Nova? Absolutely
[6:01:21] <$hattrick61> about right
[6:01:21] <thetunnelhomer> You become a DMC character really
[6:01:21] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Literally flash step shotgun charging all over the map
[6:01:21] <JetpackMcQuack> They have the warp move?
[6:01:24] <DatAsuna> Only if you throw away your guns for huge cooldown reduction
[6:01:27] <%Rumbutt> ME3 Vanguard doesn't use guns because they ARE the bullet
[6:01:28] <JetpackMcQuack> I think so
[6:01:29] <@StridentSong> Yea, pretty much
[6:01:29] <dero45> with a shotgun
[6:01:29] <%Monkeyweed21> its silly
[6:01:31] <geassguy360> yeah pretty much, YOU are the heavy weapon
[6:01:32] <+trackles_64> Insanity is the true way
[6:01:32] <chancho4tierra> yes
[6:01:34] <%demiiluna> I feel more like I'm playing Omega Rugal
[6:01:35] <chancho4tierra> its great
[6:01:35] <%ingman112> It’s pretty beast
[6:01:35] <@StridentSong> Just spec super hard into biotic cooldown
[6:01:37] <+D00msDayDan> there's an upgrade for biotic charge that slows down time on impact
[6:01:38] <TheMadViking> vanguard abilties are insane in me2 and 3
[6:01:39] <aiutare47> You slam into enemies at top speed then convert your barrier into a shockwave that does damage
[6:01:39] <RushUnplugged> CHARGE>MELEE> SHOCKWAVE> CHARGE
[6:01:41] <tanarath> So, you can just debuff then charge in to explode, then reset shields & repeat
[6:01:47] <jorniev> yes
[6:01:47] <MasterTonberry23> Yeah its like a DBZ character. Yamcha Kappa
[6:01:50] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat Vanguard literally doesn't need guns on any difficulty
[6:01:53] <Mattais88> Insant teleport, slowfdown tfor shotgun, and big AOE after?
[6:01:54] <%Ranryu692> I forget, do powers interact with each other in ME2 the way they do in ME3
[6:01:54] <jorniev> VANGUARDS ARE ALWAYS OP
[6:01:59] <James_Quivers> Pat ME3 vanguards literally get a Terry Boggard POWAH WAVE
[6:01:59] <DatAsuna> It's a shame shepard can't get the energy whips that the ME3 MP vanguards have
[6:02:10] <%walternatorz> In multiplayer you can play as Krogan Vanguard
[6:02:10] <geassguy360> Charge that refills shields 100% and potentially insane cooldowns
[6:02:14] <+D00msDayDan> how long can you move in the biotic time?
[6:02:15] <@StridentSong> The Power Wave is in 2
[6:02:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> also in ME3 you can prime with your incendiary rounds, charge to detonate, iirc
[6:02:29] <$SGrim> People have always slept on soldier. It's boring on paper, but all the different options mean you roll face in all three games.
[6:02:30] <Jaysky> Biotics in ME3 Multiplayer were so fuckin powerful
[6:02:33] <%lildashots> ME3MP was based
[6:02:33] <aiutare47> @walternatorz and its amazing, charge into shockwave into barrier
[6:02:35] <tanarath> Pat is lost
[6:02:37] <dero45> ME3 multiplayer had the best biotic characters
[6:02:37] <%aWanderingKaivo> it really is, the gameplay is great
[6:02:39] <DatAsuna> @walternatorz fuck that, ME3 MP had VOLUS vanguard
[6:02:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ranryu692 yea
[6:02:40] <DSD24> ME 3 gameplay is the best
[6:02:43] <thetunnelhomer> ME3MP is better
[6:02:46] <jorniev> also krogan shotguns are awesome
[6:02:49] <Mattais88> I can never tell if the breathing hard is Shepard or pat making fun of shepard
[6:02:51] <DSD24> The Omniblade is so good
[6:02:52] <Dfreddy8> All you do is Boom Pow Boom your way to victory
[6:02:54] <%Ranryu692> @cobalt_phoenix_ thanks
[6:02:54] <thetunnelhomer> Oh yea, Volus Vanguard was busted
[6:02:54] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat you use skills as a vanguard so often in 3 you dont even have time to shoot
[6:02:59] <mr_sups> ME# is super fun gameplay wise
[6:03:05] <MasterTonberry23> ME3 is a blast to play, just shut the game off after the final shootout and imagine your own ending
[6:03:07] <mr_sups> ME3
[6:03:07] <DatAsuna> The all volus team comp was busted for a short period until they nerfed noveria
[6:03:10] <%walternatorz> @DatAsuna aw man, I stopped too soon
[6:03:22] <James_Quivers> ME3 is so fun gameplay-wise that they even made Sentinels fun
[6:03:32] <DatAsuna> you can also give the MP volus a falcon punch
[6:03:39] <Dfreddy8> There was a bug where you could level up all the tree's
[6:03:40] <RushUnplugged> underrated detail in 3: melee is a biotic blast for biotic classes and looks great
[6:03:43] <Jaysky> I have a nice memory of the ME3 Multiplayer before launch and being the sole reason my squad survived, but I was alone for 5 minutes kiting a squad of enemies
[6:03:46] <peachy996> All Krogan teams where everyone headbutts the enemies and each other
[6:03:54] <James_Quivers> THEY BETTER
[6:04:00] <%ingman112> @james_quivers They do get the lamest second power unfortunately. Just a generic lift in grenade form
[6:04:00] <DatAsuna> It makes me wish Bioware edmoton cared about combat
[6:04:00] <+trackles_64> They made it to sell loot boxes tho
[6:04:01] <geassguy360> itll come back
[6:04:03] <mikeriffic> I played ME3 MP so much
[6:04:06] <TheMadViking> theres a rumor me3 multiplayer return is gonna be revealed at e3 in a week
[6:04:08] <+Buzzkill983> ME3 Multiplayer was real good for reasons I can't fathom.
[6:04:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt they put multiplayer in andromeda too but it was bad compared to ME3's IMO
[6:04:13] <%AzureGale> As long as it isn't required to get the best endings for single player
[6:04:18] <mikeriffic> was way to fun more then it should have been, especially with friends
[6:04:18] <%Ranryu692> if they put an ME3 style multiplayer into ME4 that would be a big selling point for me
[6:04:18] <$SGrim> @peachy996 this is the way
[6:04:19] <aiutare47> In the ME3 MP you can play as a krogan battlemaster like Wrex that gets a huge hammer that you can charge with tech or biotics
[6:04:26] <+EternalJedi> is nobody running an unofficial me3mp server?
[6:04:27] <dero45> i was addicted to it but i love a horde mode that takes team work
[6:04:29] <mikeriffic> the co op was good, the maps were great
[6:04:30] <geassguy360> ME3 just plays really good in general, thats why the MP is so good
[6:04:35] <%walternatorz> actually it was the same team
[6:04:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> I think so, yeah
[6:04:39] <peachy996> The MP in Andromeda is jumpier but jankier
[6:04:42] <+cubbywolf> they shut it down
[6:04:43] <mikeriffic> fighting collectors was also fun
[6:04:46] <mikeriffic> and being a volus
[6:04:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> or not, idk?
[6:04:51] <tanarath> @patstaresat you can grief in the multi and exp is shared. you also see % of murder, so it helps motivate people, it was wholesome
[6:04:59] <%ingman112> I think the utter lack of expectations or even initial interest for MP among fans was partly what made its high quality so baffling
[6:05:00] <+Buzzkill983> I liked the Geth Sniper with proximity mines. That or the literal shadow ninja
[6:05:00] <tanarath> can't grief
[6:05:00] <%walternatorz> My understanding was the multiplayer team from ME3 got the reins on andromeda
[6:05:02] <+Toaderator> The leveling is bugged right now and you can’t reach max level
[6:05:03] <%lildashots> Unless EA can introduce loot boxes and a mass effect battle royale, they're not gonna put online in me4
[6:05:12] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt no, andromeda was the ME3 MP team. ME3 MP also gets unfairly compared because it had 4 expansions and MEA for obvious reasons was allowed 0 expansion packs.
[6:05:13] <%X2Eliah> Andromeda had too much player mobility due to jetpacks, so MP maps kinda lost their structure
[6:05:14] <JetpackMcQuack> I appreciate Mass Effect a lot more than I did at 17
[6:05:14] <Dfreddy8> Also the ME3 Multiplayer DLCs were free
[6:05:18] <jojoagain> too bad you can't get a varren pet
[6:05:26] <DatAsuna> Compared to VANILLA ME3 MP Andromeda MP was a step up
[6:05:33] <acridpaladin> it batmobiled here. dont think about it
[6:05:34] <+poysendemon> the female ninja was the best
[6:05:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Didn't character unlocks in ME3 MP basically come down to a gacha system
[6:05:52] <+cubbywolf> pew pew
[6:05:55] <%aWanderingKaivo> @ingman112 yeah I remember pre release everyone just saw it as a cynical cash grab kind of thing that was completely unwanted
[6:05:55] <DSD24> Yes
[6:05:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Or was that just Andromeda
[6:06:00] <peachy996> I still play Andromeda MP but 3 is sorely missed
[6:06:01] <%MrBorisMakarov> it did nirvana
[6:06:05] <%MrBorisMakarov> but i loved it for some reason
[6:06:06] <%ingman112> @garbagenirvana Yep and that was the worst part. Everything else was quality
[6:06:07] <dero45> always
[6:06:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> but then it was actually cool
[6:06:12] <acridpaladin> i forgot the geth made horses
[6:06:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Now that is the the mass effect experience
[6:06:14] <JetpackMcQuack> I died here a lot
[6:06:16] <%GarbageNirvana> k that's what I thought
[6:06:18] <tranquilturnip> the comparison is hilarious
[6:06:19] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> Not until ME2, she can’t.
[6:06:20] <James_Quivers> You can actually SEE those buildings now, wow
[6:06:22] <Mattais88> IIRC there's a room at either the start or end of the mako sequence full of a bunch of cowards
[6:06:24] <+cubbywolf> ultra instinct mako
[6:06:39] <%MrBorisMakarov> what was the tall geth in mp that you could play is
[6:06:43] <%MrBorisMakarov> was it destroyer?
[6:06:46] <ChungusQuest> People will generally forgive, even embrace the gacha element if the game it's tied to is fucking awesome.
[6:06:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Now see I'd be cool with that if the multiplayer was standalone and f2p
[6:06:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Now this place feels bigger than a single camp
[6:06:51] <%ingman112> Juggernaut
[6:06:52] <DatAsuna> Geth Juggernaut
[6:06:52] <peachy996> Geth Juggernaut
[6:06:56] <Dfreddy8> Jump off the bridge there's something down theeft side Kappa
[6:06:59] <JonKhan> I don't care what anyone says. I always loved the Mako, even at its worst
[6:07:04] <%MrBorisMakarov> fuck, juggernaut was cool
[6:07:05] <+Buzzkill983> Screw him in particular
[6:07:06] <%lildashots> This was smarter than Los Angeles on a bad day in the original release on 360
[6:07:15] <JetpackMcQuack> You had to get out and shoot for experience, i remember LUL
[6:07:16] <peachy996> Juggernauts were bros but I could never play one myself
[6:07:18] <Mattais88> The flaming ragdoll really sells it
[6:07:23] <%wizkid50000> wizkid50000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months, currently on a 46 month streak! Happy 46 Months, Pat! Just checking in after a while, glad to see you playing my fav series. Have you played ME before?
[6:07:28] <peachy996> Couldn't be Sync Killed either

[6:07:41] <%Ascethetic> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[6:07:43] <DatAsuna> I do think if Andromeda had the chance to actually expand on it's MP with DLCs as well it would have similarly matured quite well.
[6:07:45] <RedPlasticCup> he cant get up
[6:07:45] <$RealThiele> he melty
[6:07:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> the Mako's insanity was actually fun

[6:07:57] <+cubbywolf> up
[6:07:58] <DatAsuna> We wouldn't be so fond of ME3 MP if you were stuck with just the base game.
[6:07:58] <%lildashots> psaGiefrail
[6:07:59] <RushUnplugged> he point the butt at you
[6:08:00] <%Taisuru> BIG POUT

[6:08:19] <DatAsuna> no signal? my favourite
[6:08:20] <mak0t0yukii> Gimme your fat to sleep on pat
[6:08:21] <JetpackMcQuack> tell him about the reapers
[6:08:22] <+Ropcord> :(
[6:08:22] <tonfirean> oh, Yes Signal
[6:08:30] <+Buzzkill983> I love it when dogs give frustrated sighs when you stay up later than they want
[6:08:33] <%ingman112> You can actually exit and check out those side doors, if you like. I didn’t know til years later
[6:08:36] <%MidnightBurst12> awww
[6:08:37] <%aWanderingKaivo> @DatAsuna Probably, I think a big part of my displeasure with it is just because I preferred the power system in ME3. And gunplay felt/sounded better in ME3 too IMO
[6:08:37] <DatAsuna> he is a foldy baby
[6:08:40] <+Ploobie> you're a squishy dog pillow
[6:08:44] <%Ranryu692> are you still sleeping on the couch, or has he healed enough to jump on the bed?

[6:09:27] <+cubbywolf> ugh open worlds
[6:09:36] <+D00msDayDan> you can hit them on the way back
[6:09:40] <tanarath> Along EVERY section of the bridge & underground

[6:20:10] <+cubbywolf> Shepard endorses dodge coin as the best coin in the station
[6:20:21] <Mattais88> Not even any loot
[6:20:24] <%Puhff> cheer500 Do you think people would have liked the Geth more if they had renamed themselves the Jeff? I think so. Jeffs are always cool dudes. And if you do meet a bad Jeff, they were actually Geoff the whole time. Happy double birthday giefy
[6:20:36] <mak0t0yukii> Yes he does
[6:20:48] <Mattais88> Shepard would endor4se anything for a 15% discount
[6:20:48] <%dekkitout> Renegade Shep would and we all know it
[6:20:50] <+Saggitori> shutdown the cum
[6:21:00] <Dfreddy8> @puhff It's pronounced Geff

[6:21:11] <Profmcstevie> if blue people told Sheperd to endorse doge coin he'd throw credits down right now
[6:21:13] <%Puhff> no it isnt
[6:21:16] <%BentArcher> "I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite coin on the stock market"
[6:21:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> the Jeth

[6:21:50] <%Puhff> gethin up to no good Keepo
[6:21:54] <DatAsuna> I think I'm gonna have to catch the end of this on vod, it's getting early =n=
[6:21:56] <%AncelDeLambert> Always be asking yourself three important questions: Where is the Geef. How is the Geef. What is the Geef chewing.
[6:22:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> man the Mako MG melts primes

[6:23:23] <+Kindan55> You can only hit 28 in a single playthrough tho
[6:23:51] <+Kindan55> Or 29, or something
[6:23:57] <karl_rex> One thing I wish was that the multiplayer abilities were available in the 3 campaign
[6:24:05] <%Taisuru> @Kindan55 LUL
[6:24:09] <%QueequegTheater> How much levelling carries over to 2

[6:25:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Member that was a boss
[6:25:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> it would be pretty odd if Shep had, like, virus blade rockets or whatever

[6:57:55] <Dunmarkh> LUL LUL
[6:57:57] <akitanito> fuck off lady
[6:57:58] <%YakumoYomi> Right in the fucking face.
[6:57:59] <aiutare47> "Man fucks around, Finds out"
[6:58:00] <vilecrois> it was in the face, lady
[6:58:01] <auraofdawn> lmao
[6:58:03] <+Krecart> In the front, actually
[6:58:05] <+athuramn> so then what does he say in the "this ends now" option???
[6:58:05] <laughinjester> no I shot him in the face
[6:58:05] <Enajy314> LUL
[6:58:13] <Zalapski> oh
[6:58:14] <laughinjester> pretty much the opposite of what u said
[6:58:15] <Basch71> shot him in the front actually
[6:58:16] <Zalapski> welp
[6:58:18] <%DianaTheAscian> naw he had it coming
[6:58:23] <tanarath> He was literally john capitalism and wanted to murder you
[6:58:25] <Brothermanhyll> In the face
[6:58:27] <%StaceMcGate> YOU JUST LEARNED ABOUT IT
[6:58:28] <akitanito> by shooting them harder
[6:58:36] <DSD24> Or just punch them
[6:58:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> NERVE AGENT?
[6:58:41] <%zyberion626> time to punch everyone in the face
[6:58:41] <+Kindan55> To be fair, I did the charm option, but really wanted to shoot him.
[6:58:46] <%DJFakie> Noveria gives you enough to pass that, there's a bunch of +24s there
[6:58:48] <akitanito> how is that not bad?
[6:58:50] <%dekkitout> "DO NOT. Release the nervegas!"
[6:58:50] <Sigma_190_Beta> WOW WE ARE JUST DOING WAR CRIMES!
[6:59:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> HAH..... Peen
[6:59:02] <ianabstract> Wrex knows the deal
[6:59:07] <Jaysky> No.
[6:59:09] <+Krecart> Punch Everyone
[6:59:11] <aiutare47> Nah we'll kill em thanks
[6:59:16] <%dekkitout> I love how Wrex down for flashbanging fools
[6:59:17] <trianglehat> no :)
[6:59:20] <%YakumoYomi> Nah tho
[6:59:20] <Profmcstevie> No I want to shoot
[6:59:21] <Brothermanhyll> It wont kill em,just cripple em
[6:59:25] <akitanito> gotta make sure
[6:59:26] <Dunmarkh> pretty based
[6:59:28] <JetpackMcQuack> Why waste time
[6:59:29] <jackelzxaa> Renegade shepard "I will kill everyone for fun!"
[6:59:29] <Jaysky> Too dangerous, shoot them up.
[6:59:30] <NitronStreams> Burn them all Shepard
[6:59:30] <+CowsRTasty> It's not even a hard Renegade option either
[6:59:38] <%emperordread> I guess if you want to get sweet with Exo-geni it makes sense?
[6:59:38] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Wrex is ok with poisoning an entire group of people when his own people were gassed
[6:59:43] <%X2Eliah> "Light them up" is a pretty solid way to deal with civilians
[6:59:45] <tranquilturnip> we've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas
[6:59:46] <NeroInfinite> It's a soft ren option
[6:59:47] <%DJFakie> The melee is way easier though TBH
[6:59:54] <+drawdehellfire> Sounds good. Lets nerve gas our own citizens.
[7:00:02] <jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt it didnt used to refill your grenades
[7:00:03] <aiutare47> wait is it equiped?
[7:00:04] <$Futurecity10> Dont forget you have to mod the grenades
[7:00:04] <+D00msDayDan> you also get tons clearing out the colony
[7:00:05] <%zyberion626> did you accept the gavin quest pat?
[7:00:08] <+Krecart> Don't forget to actually switch to the gas grenade upgrade @PatStaresAt
[7:00:11] <+BeardedGhost0_0> No theyre coming right for us. We have to put them down
[7:00:13] <%MaxeusTheFirst> @Bluwizard21 Results.
[7:00:20] <%Puhff> catJAM
[7:00:24] <jackelzxaa> watch pat blow them to smitherines
[7:00:25] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[7:00:28] <jackelzxaa> because he didnt put the mod on
[7:00:30] <aiutare47> yeah double check you have the Thorian Upgrade equiped first
[7:00:34] <$hattrick61> its not actual nervgas its basically lesticide
[7:00:38] <%Chichen> Payment.
[7:00:45] <jackelzxaa> "Oh god the poison grenades were still on"
[7:00:49] <$hattrick61> Conrad mission complete
[7:00:53] <jackelzxaa> "Now those people are made of goo"
[7:00:59] <Brothermanhyll> I like to make a silent takedown
[7:01:13] <akitanito> fungicide
[7:01:29] <xcompleasedad> Unequip squad, so they don't defend themselves?
[7:01:29] <aiutare47> you were about to napalm civilians
[7:01:31] <%DJFakie> psaUp
[7:01:32] <akitanito> now just shoot them anyway
[7:01:36] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt You will have to sell some of those upgrades/mods, there's a max inventory cap
[7:01:36] <$hattrick61> That would have been embarrassing
[7:01:41] <laughinjester> why shouldn't u use grenades?
[7:01:43] <%walternatorz> wait, that makes it sound more sarcastic
[7:01:45] <Profmcstevie> Oopsie poopsie I mixed up my lethal and non lethal grenades
[7:01:46] <jackelzxaa> when paige does this mission she's going to accidentally kill everyone
[7:01:52] <%zyberion626> @xcompleasedad nah you give em the order to not shoot
[7:01:57] <%DJFakie> @PatStaresAt You might set squad to Defensive powers so they don't accidentally merc someone
[7:01:59] <jackelzxaa> convert them to omnigel so you can bypass hacking minigames
[7:02:04] <HaroldDonchee> I legit love the profile of the mako. its low and badass looking
[7:02:06] <Brothermanhyll> Non lethal bat-napalm
[7:02:09] <%emperordread> long stream yay
[7:02:12] <$Futurecity10> 24 HOURS STREAM LETS GOOOOOOOO
[7:02:13] <%Puhff> YEAH
[7:02:15] <%AzureGale> Yeah but dog want slep
[7:02:16] <%Puhff> FUCK IT
[7:02:16] <laughinjester> technically Thursday
[7:02:17] <JetpackMcQuack> fuck thursday
[7:02:18] <aiutare47> also yeah someone said it was just a bug I had but I remember my party freaking out and killing the colonists, save just in case
[7:02:20] <jackelzxaa> the mako with boosters is just objectively better
[7:02:23] <+D00msDayDan> it's free content
[7:02:29] <jackelzxaa> you can ACTUALLY climb hills now
[7:02:30] <leinadtonu> fuck tomorrow
[7:02:30] <%Ranryu692> I gotta be up in 7 hours but meh
[7:02:30] <%AzureGale> Impromptu marathon gooooooooooo
[7:02:31] <%SaiyanShoto> Future Pat will be displeased
[7:02:37] <+sinistersally> i mean we litterally watch him spend hours doing macros on ffxiv
[7:02:47] <jackelzxaa> if the mako controlled like this originally it might have stayed for the whole trilogy
[7:02:54] <Ranger747> i wanna befriend a super-tall Geth
[7:02:57] <Dunmarkh> "we"
[7:02:59] <%Xelhesia> yup
[7:03:01] <akitanito> why would you guys do this
[7:03:02] <RetributionP> I figured out why gief dosnt like the screen. The character moves into a position and freezes. dogs kinda freeze right before they "attack"
[7:03:08] <%Xelhesia> was fun tho
[7:03:08] <%MisterRockett> Yeah
[7:03:08] <tanarath> Sounds like you
[7:03:11] <$hattrick61> Man you just know somewhere in real life someone has actually accidentally threw a frag grenade instead of a flashbang
[7:03:14] <%Chichen> im sorry, they want you to help that?
[7:03:15] <%X2Eliah> And this is why Thorian is big evil
[7:03:17] <%Monkeyweed21> crafting streams
[7:03:19] <+sinistersally> yep, when he did the ffxiv guide
[7:03:20] <+CowsRTasty> The creepers are fine to kill
[7:03:21] <jackelzxaa> remember when pat recorded a 9 hour stream of him scratching his butt live on stream
[7:03:23] <+Krecart> you can kill those
[7:03:24] <%DJFakie> They'll tell you when it's time
[7:03:34] <Brothermanhyll> Freaker nest!
[7:03:36] <Mattais88> Looks more like a Drak Souls hollow
[7:03:45] <akitanito> do they throw grenades?
[7:03:46] <%dekkitout> *Tali thought that wasn't very cash money*
[7:03:52] <%X2Eliah> 16 alive
[7:03:56] <%zyberion626> remember Pat, you can melee them if you're out of nades
[7:03:56] <jackelzxaa> you can just book it for the elevator i think
[7:04:03] <$hattrick61> thorian creepers? awwwww maaaannn
[7:04:05] <+Kindan55> It's kind of wack that anyone but Wrex would even agree to shoot them
[7:04:12] <jackelzxaa> the vfx are so much better now
[7:04:12] <otakon17> Pat, don't forget you can use melee on the colonists to just knock them out
[7:04:19] <otakon17> Wrex is pragmatic
[7:04:21] <%Chichen> bop it
[7:04:24] <jackelzxaa> YOU CAN MELEE THEM???
[7:04:26] <thetruenicster> oh, he knows
[7:04:27] <xcompleasedad> Amazing
[7:04:27] <%DJFakie> Melee is great in this part
[7:04:27] <JoshTheFace> LUL
[7:04:28] <jackelzxaa> i thought that killed them
[7:04:28] <otakon17> bob
[7:04:29] <ChungusQuest> that is incredible
[7:04:30] <akitanito> if only that actually kills them
[7:04:32] <%zyberion626> boop
[7:04:34] <%X2Eliah> Oh melee works too? jeez. that makes it so much easier
[7:04:34] <laughinjester> does that not kill them?
[7:04:36] <leinadtonu> bop em
[7:04:37] <Profmcstevie> bop it, smack it
[7:04:37] <%Bane_Kaikyo> That's great
[7:04:37] <%DJFakie> Yep! In case you run out of grenades
[7:04:39] <xcompleasedad> BOP IT
[7:04:44] <%MaxeusTheFirst> They run like Shepherd trying to tell someone, "We'll bang, okay?"
[7:04:45] <otakon17> yeah you can melee them it's MUCH easier with a dedicated melee button this time
[7:04:48] <%dekkitout> Oh, when I get ova there Imma nudge ya do hard
[7:04:50] <leinadtonu> BOP'EM GOOD!
[7:04:50] <+TheMorilo> This game is so great
[7:04:50] <%ArcanumArcanum> gotta love in the original that hte Melee was context sensitive trigger pull, and sometimes wouldn't register so you shotgun em in the face
[7:04:53] <%vaporousTippler> I like to think he's clubbing them with the gas grenades.
[7:04:56] <$hattrick61> just dont let wrex love tap em
[7:05:00] <jackelzxaa> i never knew you could bop them, but also melee was so finnicky in the original game because it was just "shoot while infront of htem to melee"
[7:05:03] <karl_rex> The heavy melee was a good addition in 3
[7:05:05] <otakon17> in the original version you ONLY used melee if you were in an enemies face and could still accidentally shoot them
[7:05:17] <otakon17> yeah the melee was a good addition to 1 too
[7:05:23] <+CowsRTasty> oh fuck they made melee seperate?
[7:05:24] <Wan6Saber> lol
[7:05:28] <%Ranryu692> maybe you got enough gym badges so now they'll listen to you
[7:05:30] <SFTengu> @otakon17 I remember that, because the shoot trigger was also melee
[7:05:35] <otakon17> cutscenes, cutscenes fuck up your squaddies weapon selection
[7:05:46] <jackelzxaa> if you have gas grenades left they're 1 hit kills against creepers when you're done "saving" the colonists
[7:05:47] <$hattrick61> Also the gas grenades insta gib the creepers
[7:05:48] <+CowsRTasty> yeah it was a pain in the fucking ass
[7:05:54] <%dekkitout> *Thud*
[7:05:58] <+RowenCleric> god ragdolling is the best
[7:05:59] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[7:06:00] <otakon17> boop
[7:06:00] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[7:06:02] <%Chichen> she took a few extra
[7:06:02] <Wan6Saber> kiaaLOL

[7:06:08] <ChungusQuest> boop LUL
[7:06:09] <+xerotwo> boop LUL
[7:06:23] <Brothermanhyll> Garrys mod
[7:06:32] <otakon17> THE FALL KNOCKED HIM OUT
[7:06:40] <jackelzxaa> crossfire is a legit danger tali CAN shoot a colonist accidentally here
[7:06:41] <otakon17> I love the ragdolls in ME1 they're so damn jank
[7:06:47] <jackelzxaa> i always tell them to wait at the door
[7:06:49] <%walternatorz> is this days gone?
[7:06:58] <otakon17> damn you got any shredder rounds?
[7:07:03] <jackelzxaa> is that all 16
[7:07:08] <%zyberion626> this is actually the better strat cause those grenades are useful for the boss fight
[7:07:13] <jackelzxaa> i think pat booped them all
[7:07:13] <otakon17> I think so
[7:07:16] <ChungusQuest> the ragdoll i fucking cant
[7:07:16] <%X2Eliah> Thats all 16
[7:07:16] <$hattrick61> Shepard concusses entire colony
[7:07:21] <%DJFakie> Good shit
[7:07:24] <otakon17> Pat: Master Booper
[7:07:26] <xcompleasedad> Didn't get us that time!
[7:07:30] <%zyberion626> what a hero
[7:07:32] <Brothermanhyll> Shephard growls to himself about the wife
[7:07:33] <jackelzxaa> renegade shep: "Kill them all" paragon shep: "Boop them all"
[7:07:37] <%StaceMcGate> rip Quark
[7:07:37] <akitanito> just boop him
[7:07:37] <Profmcstevie> Whole colony wakes up with bumps on their heads, "another colony saved"
[7:07:41] <DSD24> This scene is pretty sad
[7:07:44] <%zyberion626> quick! boop him!
[7:07:44] <otakon17> "I heroically knocked Y'ALL THE FUCK OUT"
[7:07:46] <Dabrikishaw> @zyberion626 Yeah, I kept forgetting how good Anti-Thorian grenades were for the boss fight
[7:07:49] <%X2Eliah> Thorian is big evil
[7:07:56] <%AzureGale> F
[7:07:57] <jackelzxaa> pat failed to boop fydan
[7:08:02] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Boop
[7:08:02] <akitanito> goddamn it shepard, you could just punch him
[7:08:04] <otakon17> You were a good guy Fai Dan
[7:08:09] <otakon17> o7
[7:08:09] <xcompleasedad> It assumes Renegade?
[7:08:09] <%Ranryu692> you could've just gassed him
[7:08:10] <+athuramn> shephards eyes look real sinister
[7:08:11] <Dabrikishaw> Oh No! Fai Dan! It's a shame I couldn't use my spare gas grenades to save you
[7:08:14] <%Ranryu692> well, not you you
[7:08:14] <%dekkitout> Alright- plant's evil. Fucking frag the jerk!
[7:08:20] <%Puhff> no boop for fai dan
[7:08:20] <aiutare47> what was that moon walk?
[7:08:20] <Dunmarkh> that was a rubber bullet
[7:08:24] <otakon17> nah he's dead
[7:08:24] <Brothermanhyll> He shoulda booped himself
[7:08:24] <Broken_Sonex> Shepard has very powerful squint game in ME1
[7:08:30] <+D00msDayDan> he secretly wasn't a colonist
[7:08:32] <otakon17> he got...the PERMANENT boop
[7:08:33] <%lildashots> You ever watched a man commit suicide in front of you and then just moonwalk on his corpse
[7:08:42] <Brothermanhyll> He saw Fight Club
[7:08:46] <+mlow44> This is my favorite area to swap to explosive rounds. Aiming at enemies' feet will launch them and sometimes lodge them in walls/ceilings
[7:08:50] <+D00msDayDan> now run back and shoot them all while they're unconscious
[7:08:53] <%moonmintparadise> Are you implying that he was a Impostor
[7:08:55] <xbb1024> It's the opposite of Yakuza, cutscene deaths don't count
[7:09:02] <%Puhff> psaDab
[7:09:02] <RAH001> everytime i hear that sound effect. i hear the playstation one
[7:09:03] <$hattrick61> Boop at reletiveistic velocity
[7:09:05] <%Monkeyweed21> why are you not wearing a helmet
[7:09:06] <jackelzxaa> i am surprised pat went for charm instead of intimidate
[7:09:07] <%X2Eliah> Why are the top 2 charm pips locked out tho
[7:09:13] <%peanutdot007> Watching someone kill themself just made Shepard more powerful
[7:09:13] <%X2Eliah> They should e open right now
[7:09:16] <+CowsRTasty> mmm polonium rounds
[7:09:24] <+RowenCleric> dont look at the screen Gief
[7:09:26] <jackelzxaa> some of these rounds dont show up after grade 7
[7:09:32] <RetributionP> content
[7:09:32] <%dekkitout> Why are there even duplicate ammo upgrades?
[7:09:39] <%DJFakie> psaDogchamp
[7:09:40] <jackelzxaa> the ones that have organic/synthetic strenghts are gone after level 7
[7:09:46] <KeiPrime> for more than one gun
[7:09:49] <jackelzxaa> you can never get more after that point
[7:10:07] <+mlow44> @PatStaresAt Keep rank VII Tungsten/Shredder/Polonium rounds, you don't get stronger ones of those and they don't drop at higher levels
[7:10:08] <%zyberion626> @dekkitout you can see why ME2 overhauled the entire inventory system
[7:10:12] <jackelzxaa> improved sights only shows up super early and in the original game you needed to hold onto those to make a good version of a gun
[7:10:19] <%GodDougle> GodDougle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[7:10:22] <%DJFakie> Tungsten+Shredder
[7:10:25] <aiutare47> you are either going to love ME3s system or HATE it
[7:10:52] <KeiPrime> yeah if you dont keep an eye on it the weapon mods will add up
[7:11:01] <%DJFakie> It's not a huge deal cause Normal difficulty but +40% is essential in Insanity
[7:11:03] <$hattrick61> Yeah bjt the new HE rounds are busted
[7:11:05] <laughinjester> good call
[7:11:09] <jackelzxaa> in the original version of me1 mods could actually make up for not having weapon training in assault rifles to an extent
[7:11:20] <jackelzxaa> but only very specific setups
[7:11:21] <+CowsRTasty> Yeah I always went with DoT rounds myself
[7:11:22] <%DJFakie> "Well, that's just great."
[7:11:29] <Dunmarkh> meaty
[7:11:34] <+mlow44> On Insanity I only ran with Polonium or Inferno rounds for general use
[7:11:35] <beefcakemanthrob> hottest asari
[7:11:36] <Mattais88> Wow that looks way better than the green blob
[7:11:36] <laughinjester> it's not a tumah!
[7:11:40] <+D00msDayDan> we're gonna need a bigger gun
[7:11:41] <+Kindan55> Time for indigenous genocide!
[7:11:43] <akitanito> eww slobber
[7:11:45] <%Ranryu692> I had forgotten that this whole level is a Halo 2 reference
[7:11:45] <vile_brand> thats a cthulu
[7:11:48] <jackelzxaa> the thorian is one of the coolest things from mass effect 1 that they never brought back
[7:11:49] <karl_rex> Eugh
[7:11:53] <%zyberion626> *ahem* SCHLORP
[7:11:55] <laughinjester> ^^^
[7:11:55] <KeiPrime> green asari
[7:11:56] <%walternatorz> just go ahead and approach the spore-spreading psychic plant without your helmet
[7:11:56] <%MaxeusTheFirst> "It's afraid!"
[7:11:57] <NeroInfinite> That's a...not great
[7:11:58] <%Ranryu692> it kind of looks like Dream's helmet from Sandman
[7:11:58] <$hattrick61> Its a "girl", mazeltav
[7:12:00] <akitanito> I like how she gets cloned with clothes
[7:12:00] <Brothermanhyll> “Gonna try to sleep with it”
[7:12:02] <Mattais88> She looks way less green though
[7:12:03] <laughinjester> cthulu for aure
[7:12:04] <%X2Eliah> Thorian is big evil
[7:12:05] <JetpackMcQuack> sure buddy
[7:12:06] <8th_nel> dumpy
[7:12:06] <geassguy360> yeah the original thorian textures were soo blurry
[7:12:10] <RetributionP> vorreee
[7:12:20] <KeiPrime> yeah she is more aqua than the stark green from the original
[7:12:29] <+RowenCleric> the sclortching noise is so loud
[7:12:30] <%dekkitout> BOO! Not even in iambic pentameter
[7:12:34] <Thepothero> Ewww slimy rooScream
[7:12:42] <%peanutdot007> I feel like I'm looking at Uroboros
[7:12:42] <%DJFakie> Let my people go!
[7:12:45] <JetpackMcQuack> Saren is my only
[7:12:47] <$Futurecity10> Thorian creeper's instant kill on insanity
[7:12:52] <+drawdehellfire> who is va
[7:12:55] <$hattrick61> It now actually looks like an asari with a skin condition
[7:12:59] <aiutare47> I love the thorian so so much
[7:13:09] <%moonmintparadise> hey that depth of field looks pretty good actually
[7:13:13] <laughinjester> all praise the thorian
[7:13:17] <+trackles_64> God this was frustrating on isanity
[7:13:27] <+xerotwo> so much for that LUL
[7:13:34] <%X2Eliah> If you hit the node first, it pops all the local creepers
[7:13:42] <Broken_Sonex> "YOU OWE ME AWE" - The Thorian
[7:13:43] <+trackles_64> Giant luigie woman
[7:13:46] <$lotharrio> Oh good, it's that gross thing.
[7:13:48] <RetributionP> rip me2 I think
[7:13:52] <%DJFakie> You probably won't die but I don't think it saves that often here!
[7:13:53] <akitanito> and the clothes
[7:13:55] <%peanutdot007> And the clothes
[7:13:56] <+OneGorillionDollars> YES
[7:14:00] <laughinjester> trueeee
[7:14:00] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[7:14:00] <%zyberion626> shhhh
[7:14:01] <%dekkitout> It makes clothes and guns?
[7:14:03] <%Chichen> just picks up gun from last clone
[7:14:04] <Thepothero> crikFear
[7:14:06] <NeroInfinite> Yes
[7:14:08] <$lotharrio> It had guns it had already eaten.
[7:14:08] <+xerotwo> eeeeeeeeeeeee
[7:14:09] <jackelzxaa> its barfing out a clone of her clothes too
[7:14:11] <+dariusclover> biogun
[7:14:13] <+CowsRTasty> the Thorian was just a 3D printer all along
[7:14:15] <+justianxix> so advanced
[7:14:21] <ianabstract> wrex taking cover and tali face-tanking is so funny
[7:14:26] <aiutare47> all those clones are just chilling in there, waiting, its not making them on the fly I dont think
[7:14:27] <bigDEEforya> its queffing out the clone pat get it right
[7:14:27] <$lotharrio> Wrex immediately pulls out another pistol.
[7:14:28] <%DJFakie> Thorian goo goes through shields BTW so take care
[7:14:28] <xbb1024> ok, now I'm seeing the industrial application of this plant
[7:14:30] <xXxPS9xXx> Just has a gun and clothes pouch her clone body slides through before coming out LUL
[7:14:36] <vile_brand> i think wrex switched back to his pistol
[7:14:39] <%zyberion626> Wrex like smol gun
[7:15:01] <jackelzxaa> this is one of those rare times when having them have clothes legitimately makes no sense
[7:15:28] <RetributionP> every stream pat whistles he ruptures my eardrumbs
[7:15:29] <%DJFakie> I think you get a bonus for going into ME2 rich
[7:15:42] <Brothermanhyll> Nakey asari assault
[7:15:46] <+trackles_64> Melts into goo
[7:15:52] <%DJFakie> Yeah, the Deagles in this game are nuts
[7:15:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> pistol gud
[7:15:55] <%X2Eliah> It imports 10% of your cash into ME2
[7:15:55] <$lotharrio> Maybe that's why Wrex is using his pistol.
[7:16:00] <%HairballCT> asari clone more like A SORRY CLONE lmao gottem
[7:16:10] <%dekkitout> Beeg werds
[7:16:14] <+CowsRTasty> pistols hit harder than i remember
[7:16:19] <+xerotwo> DISCOUNT PogChamp
[7:16:24] <42nfl19> Is the Thorian some one off thing that is never alluded to or returned to again?
[7:16:29] <aiutare47> pistols are super good and marksman melts shit by the way
[7:16:43] <Dabrikishaw> That Face When you Max Charm AFTER the only rank 12 Charm option in the game.
[7:16:47] <%zyberion626> use your nades pat
[7:16:49] <jackelzxaa> has pat looked at the assault rifle much to see how it handles in the new game?  it's actually hilarious how much more accurate it is than the way it used to work.
[7:16:50] <NeroInfinite> you have grenades pat
[7:16:55] <akitanito> you melted her
[7:16:58] <aiutare47> @42nfl19 it is mentioned in 2 and has one sentence in 3 if I recall correct
[7:17:00] <Brothermanhyll> Too many freakers
[7:17:02] <$lotharrio> Her integrations got dis'd
[7:17:08] <KeiPrime> grenades are consumables
[7:17:12] <laughinjester> yeah I agree
[7:17:27] <Profmcstevie> How the hell would you get charm 12 before that anyway, we're levelled as shit
[7:17:27] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah fuck him
[7:17:28] <jackelzxaa> make wrex pink now
[7:17:30] <+Kindan55> Doing it makes him fund the colony tho
[7:17:37] <vilecrois> Only regret is that you should've used the shotgun to blast him
[7:17:38] <$renegade_blade> there is a 12 charm on Noveria with the binary helix guy
[7:17:53] <$lotharrio> I wanna be pink...Shephard.
[7:17:56] <otakon17> yeah all the Phoenix gear has built in health regen
[7:18:06] <%dekkitout> Wrex: "Shepard, either way would I care"
[7:18:09] <otakon17> I almost always give Wrex a shottie for main, just feels right
[7:18:14] <Dabrikishaw> @Profmcstevie Really, with Pat's levels he could have maxed Charm before he got to Joeng, but I agree with killing him regardless
[7:18:14] <jackelzxaa> that is a really really well considered junk tab system
[7:18:17] <otakon17> it has double mod slots though
[7:18:21] <%zyberion626> @vilecrois since he saved all the colonists, Pat's fine
[7:18:34] <%DJFakie> You do more damage to the node the more you kill beforehand
[7:18:51] <jackelzxaa> oh no pat used a consumable (grenade)
[7:18:55] <%X2Eliah> Literally Born 2 Die
[7:19:05] <cyclog> You are not my Dad,Pat. I will let my tits go crazy !
[7:19:06] <otakon17> eh he'll get more consumables
[7:19:23] <otakon17> honestly when you level up shotguns in this game, they get REALLY goddamn good
[7:19:23] <jackelzxaa> but what if pat needs thorian gas grenades *later*?
[7:19:24] <%DJFakie> Synthesis with the Thorian
[7:19:29] <%takotoots> LUL
[7:19:32] <otakon17> putting explosive rounds on them is amazing
[7:19:33] <+justianxix> think of the directive
[7:19:36] <akitanito> he would get schlorp'd
[7:19:37] <laughinjester> seduce the thorian!
[7:19:39] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> fuck picard we kirk now
[7:19:44] <otakon17> Picard would say "SHOOT THAT SON OF A BITCH!"
[7:19:50] <DSD24> Man Starchild sucks ass
[7:19:54] <$lotharrio> Picard would give a speech while Worf tried as hard as possible to explode it.
[7:19:55] <Brothermanhyll> This isnt prime directive at all
[7:19:58] <+SenorCounter> Think what Janeway would do.
[7:19:58] <xcompleasedad> We Movie Picard now
[7:19:59] <JetpackMcQuack> something's happening here for sure
[7:20:02] <karl_rex> Every day I think What Would Kirk Do?
[7:20:02] <%dekkitout> Will this thorian arc end with the last assari clone remaining and joining the harem?
[7:20:03] <Profmcstevie> The Microwaves started it
[7:20:09] <%peanutdot007> If it was a kid then Picard would kill it
[7:20:15] <+xerotwo> Imagine if corpos had this tech, UGH doodBait
[7:20:17] <beefcakemanthrob> i agree with Tali. kill synthetics
[7:20:24] <arkv01> picard would give that speech while pounding some synthetic ass
[7:20:25] <Mattais88> Yeah Humans are never the REAL monsters
[7:20:33] <karl_rex> Kirk would kill it
[7:20:42] <+drawdehellfire> I agree with beefcake. Kill space children.
[7:20:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Just be glad we're pro colony
[7:20:53] <BurdRightsActivist> That looks like a pee peee lol
[7:20:54] <%DJFakie> I wish you could do the Krogan charge
[7:20:55] <Mattais88> ME# multiplayer. Krogan Battlemaster
[7:20:56] <Jaysky> We are really massively effecting the livelihood of this new lifeform
[7:20:59] <+Punchasaur> Giant evil plant with a zombie army and it possesses hot blue women... where have I seen this before
[7:20:59] <Brothermanhyll> Didnt that happen with VGER
[7:21:01] <aiutare47> guess what you can do in ME3 MP Pat
[7:21:02] <vilecrois> Drop the giant brain in the nightmare of mensis yet again
[7:21:02] <otakon17> Wrex is basically a Vanguard
[7:21:03] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls Life forms SourPls you tiny little life form SourPls
[7:21:05] <$lotharrio> Wrex is too powerful to be the PC.
[7:21:05] <%zyberion626> assault rifle being pseudo locked to one class kinda sucked
[7:21:06] <jackelzxaa> the problem with the starchild thing is they didnt work with the entire writing team when they made that ending, so the people working on rannoch accidentally made an ending that completely contradicts the ending of the game.  (maybe if casey hudson hadn't been such a self aggrandizing idiot he could have let the whole team help to make sure that the ending was good and the game wasn't narratively broken)
[7:21:07] <akitanito> wait, how did it clone a gun she didn't have?
[7:21:08] <someyounguy1> congratulations you destroyed an irreplaceable untold years old species
[7:21:09] <+D00msDayDan> that's vanguard in NG+ with AR specialization
[7:21:14] <+athuramn> "I suppose"?
[7:21:14] <cyclog> Nah,be a dick for saving you.
[7:21:18] <Sigma_190_Beta> BUSTER WOLF!
[7:21:19] <%DJFakie> Nonono, don't Buster Wolf her on instinct!
[7:21:19] <Brothermanhyll> Spock pounded a synthetic planet
[7:21:22] <+xerotwo> BUSTA WOLF!!!!
[7:21:30] <Dabrikishaw> You cab play a Vanguard with Assault rifile training if you unlock the bonus power by beating the game
[7:21:34] <otakon17> surprised you didn't make a Harrier Du Shepard
[7:21:42] <akitanito> he had high charm
[7:21:57] <$lotharrio> Can Vanguards also wear heavy armor/
[7:22:12] <%Atomik456> she needed that robo turian dick
[7:22:15] <aiutare47> @lotharrio no only medium in ME1
[7:22:16] <Dunmarkh> @lotharrio no, only soldier can
[7:22:21] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> How is this possibles?
[7:22:25] <%DianaTheAscian> oh thats what that is
[7:22:31] <+drawdehellfire> Willing slave Kreygasm
[7:22:32] <%SirGO0SE> I wish Brent Spiner would do video games
[7:22:33] <%Atomik456> they call it aviary fever
[7:22:38] <+trackles_64> Serves you right
[7:22:42] <%peanutdot007> Indoctrination is probably the most bullshit plot excuse in Mass Effect
[7:22:53] <aiutare47> @Atomik456 bird flu?
[7:22:56] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt How does Liara react to this conversation?
[7:23:00] <jackelzxaa> i actually just spent a few hours unlocking all of the tech and biotic tallents before i started my own playthrough of Legendary.  (squadmates and sentinel proc them, and most of them don't need a target anymore)
[7:23:05] <akitanito> why did she go quiet there
[7:23:07] <%Atomik456> @Atomik456 fuck this is way better
[7:23:15] <%X2Eliah> On the upside, Indoctrination was a consistent thing since ME1
[7:23:22] <aiutare47> @peanutdot007 sure, buts very Lovecraftian, so it makes sense
[7:23:38] <%DianaTheAscian> wow so its old as shit
[7:23:38] <%dekkitout> A literal grave mind?
[7:23:40] <JetpackMcQuack> what a sentence
[7:23:40] <BurdRightsActivist> loving that z-fighting on your gun
[7:23:54] <+athuramn> protheans are givers
[7:23:56] <+drawdehellfire> Blue looks cold red looks hot. It's not hard
[7:23:59] <DSD24> Cipher!
[7:24:13] <+bassforte123> I do like the twist that the reason Saren has no interest in stealing plant mind control stuff is because  he already has way better mind control tech on hand
[7:24:15] <$lotharrio> Yea but GIMME
[7:24:15] <arkv01> mind sex?
[7:24:16] <%X2Eliah> So uh so Shiala just literally has Asari sex with you right there. Just out in the open. In front of Tali.
[7:24:19] <arkv01> I'm RELAXED BABE
[7:24:23] <mak0t0yukii> Put your dick in her
[7:24:24] <DSD24> Wait she didn't give you a choice
[7:24:27] <%SirGO0SE> LUL his face
[7:24:28] <+athuramn> "I should go now"
[7:24:30] <aiutare47> kinda like a
[7:24:30] <KeiPrime> e m b r a c e e t e r n i t y
[7:24:31] <+RoByte2> Embrace eternity!
[7:24:31] <Jaysky> Are we having the blue sex?
[7:24:31] <Dabrikishaw> Not getting to talk to a Thorian will always be the biggest missed oppertunity'
[7:24:32] <aiutare47> FORCE
[7:24:32] <+AmericanSkidd> Words that Kill?
[7:24:34] <%Atomik456> @aiutare47 fuck this is way better
[7:24:35] <%MaxeusTheFirst> @drawdehellfire Blue fire and red kool-ade.
[7:24:35] <Mattais88> We'll bang, okay
[7:24:37] <arkv01> ohhh my mind dick is slipping in...
[7:24:37] <%zyberion626> time to bang
[7:24:38] <karl_rex> Freaky mind shit time
[7:24:39] <%dekkitout> Is Shep about to become a Jedi?
[7:24:41] <%peanutdot007> This is some dumb Star Trek stuff
[7:24:45] <Brothermanhyll> Did you know I killed you repeatedly with a shotgun
[7:24:46] <$lotharrio> Make sure you don't pee on her by accident.
[7:24:47] <+trackles_64> space orgasm
[7:24:48] <RetributionP> KNOWLAGE THROUGH SEX
[7:24:48] <JetpackMcQuack> reach out and touch faith
[7:24:49] <mak0t0yukii> We'll bang okay
[7:24:50] <DSD24> Man the prothean memories are so funny
[7:24:53] <+athuramn> that was a jank camera pan
[7:24:54] <Profmcstevie> Breathe the cosmos
[7:24:56] <Dabrikishaw> @42nfl19 Same as everyone else when I brought here
[7:24:56] <DSD24> Hahaha!
[7:24:56] <%X2Eliah> Asari foreplay is *weird*
[7:25:03] <%Xelhesia> ah yes sex
[7:25:04] <akitanito> feels like I'm looking at prototype instead
[7:25:09] <viewtifulr> preform the Sethatsu-NO-HADO
[7:25:09] <%peanutdot007> SPACE GUM
[7:25:10] <DSD24> I love the public domain screams
[7:25:10] <%zyberion626> JELLY MICROCHIPS
[7:25:10] <arkv01> they're kinda cool in a freaky ass way
[7:25:11] <+drawdehellfire> @MaxeusTheFirst Blue fire looks cold and red koolaid looks hot
[7:25:11] <Jaysky> I understand everything now
[7:25:16] <jackelzxaa> fun fact: casey hudson made all of the photograph materiels for the vision
[7:25:16] <+AFellowDegen> I really want to find the  :making of" of these scenes
[7:25:16] <%AzureGale> Libera te tutemet ex inferis...
[7:25:18] <beefcakemanthrob> gum on a circuit board is pretty terrifying though
[7:25:22] <+xerotwo> W H O O S H
[7:25:23] <Brothermanhyll> Ahhhh Raytheoooon
[7:25:24] <+D00msDayDan> yeah and it's cool as shit
[7:25:24] <akitanito> ah, pubic crabs
[7:25:24] <42nfl19> Wait...ISNT THIS THE SAME ANS MIND FUCKING?
[7:25:26] <Broken_Sonex> Man, Asari mind sex is crazy, huh?
[7:25:26] <Dunmarkh> Was it good for you too?
[7:25:26] <jackelzxaa> he actually jammed circuit boards into hamburger meat in his basement
[7:25:27] <+athuramn> would sheppards had just not explode from all that
[7:25:28] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's like we are looking at their proof of concept rather than anything else.
[7:25:31] <+athuramn> *head
[7:25:33] <+trackles_64> that look is so weird
[7:25:34] <RAH001> when you chew 5 gum
[7:25:35] <moonmeh> lmao her expression
[7:25:36] <%X2Eliah> omg that face
[7:25:37] <xbb1024> putting gum on a circuit board is horrifying
[7:25:38] <xcompleasedad> THE FUCKING WIGGLING
[7:25:38] <arkv01> we have banged
[7:25:38] <%AzureGale> So... did we do it?
[7:25:40] <JetpackMcQuack> anyway, I'm pregnant
[7:25:42] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU'RE A DAD NOW
[7:25:43] <Dabrikishaw> None of this would make any sense to me either.
[7:25:43] <+Daigrey> Remember when fucking Star Trek Picard copied this?
[7:25:45] <+xerotwo> doodStare
[7:25:47] <laughinjester> @akitanito yes heavy prototype vibes
[7:25:47] <jackelzxaa> shepard just came in his armor and he's embarassed
[7:25:50] <xcompleasedad> Wiggle wiggle wiggle
[7:25:52] <%AzureGale> I just saw Event Horizon
[7:25:54] <+drawdehellfire> She's gonna show you her cloaca
[7:25:57] <Samurai_Tchan> TALI YOUR FACE IS A VISOR
[7:26:02] <Brothermanhyll> Shephard we have swapped bodies
[7:26:03] <jackelzxaa> the renegade decision here is so fucked up
[7:26:04] <generalve> @patstaresat do you ever take Garrus with you ?
[7:26:06] <RetributionP> I wonder if Liara saids to that
[7:26:07] <neon_z1> i saw weird shit
[7:26:07] <RushUnplugged> no guys, the dark matter and stars dying thing was totally NOT gonna be part of the ending and the Reaper's motivation, Hudson totally didn't change it last minute at all
[7:26:13] <jackelzxaa> for this specific npc
[7:26:17] <beefcakemanthrob> even shepard doesn't want to dwell on gummy circuitboards
[7:26:17] <%Retinolgaming> Do we ever learn why they all look like squid?
[7:26:27] <%Extrallent> Isn't Shiala supposed to be green?
[7:26:27] <karl_rex> This comes back in 3 in Javiks recruitment mission
[7:26:32] <+athuramn> because it's rad
[7:26:32] <jackelzxaa> kinda
[7:26:38] <%X2Eliah> Who cares about the thorian anymore, it's gone and will never come back
[7:26:38] <+drawdehellfire> Ancient Aliens
[7:26:47] <Jaysky> AWEsome
[7:26:48] <jackelzxaa> me3 explains some of things about the origins of the different races pre-evolution
[7:26:48] <generalve> "Awesome"
[7:26:49] <+trackles_64> it was evil tho
[7:26:50] <%zyberion626> @retinolgaming the reapers? because their creators are gigantic squid
[7:26:51] <+drawdehellfire> Its mind was fucking rad dawg
[7:27:03] <Dunmarkh> good
[7:27:10] <jackelzxaa> the reapers do get an explicit explanation yeah
[7:27:15] <%dekkitout> What ecological niche does a thorian even serve
[7:27:19] <moonmeh> YEAH
[7:27:23] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[7:27:27] <generalve> "ship" Kappa
[7:27:30] <$lotharrio> Hey Shiala, you know how you're gonna be a mutant from now on?
[7:27:30] <+justianxix> yeah... a ship
[7:27:41] <%peanutdot007> "It looks kinda like a shrimp"
[7:27:41] <Samurai_Tchan> "YOUR mind is remarkable shepard, a strong mind, sexy mind""
[7:27:47] <jackelzxaa> remember that one time when those krogans ate abunch of people
[7:27:48] <%X2Eliah> Saying "x is alien" is a lot less impactful when there's like 10+ known species already
[7:27:50] <arkv01> nothing is impenetrable to the shepdick
[7:28:28] <Profmcstevie> "I'm looking for a master to give me a quick run over of the buttons"
[7:28:33] <Shade075> He is looking into how to resist it,to protect him from the reaper
[7:28:33] <Dabrikishaw> Yeah, I like going to Feroes before Virmire because the mystery is more interesting in that order
[7:28:36] <NitronStreams> "it bumps up his charm stat"
[7:28:38] <akitanito> sovereign is just the sith holocron huh
[7:28:46] <JetpackMcQuack> plot holes come later
[7:28:47] <%dekkitout> Saren has KARIZMA!
[7:28:49] <Jaysky> Did that repeat?
[7:28:49] <Basch71> name dropping that term 2 games ahead
[7:28:51] <aiutare47> The whole concept of brainwashing as a common leitmotif is really cool, and something I love about the series
[7:28:53] <%X2Eliah> @akitanito hmmm
[7:28:55] <Samurai_Tchan> THATS ONE UGLY ASARI
[7:28:57] <Broken_Sonex> "She also had big mommy bloobas"
[7:29:08] <%MisterRockett> Feels like Liara should be here.
[7:29:16] <jackelzxaa> has pat checked in with conrad venor again?  He's one of the missables because his quest has 3 stages so you need to go back in the middle of the game at least once or you miss him and his fantastic me2 and 3 import scenes
[7:29:18] <JetpackMcQuack> Saren's so god damn cool
[7:29:23] <%X2Eliah> Nah Liara does not have that much to add here
[7:29:26] <%X2Eliah> noveria tho
[7:29:26] <Samurai_Tchan> @MisterRockett yes
[7:29:30] <+drawdehellfire> Why are videogame characters so antsy? Just talk without wiggling arounf
[7:29:32] <Jaysky> Once I was blind but now I see!
[7:29:36] <+AmericanSkidd> She is now what you humans call a "Dommy Mommy"
[7:29:41] <+Daigrey> How do you trust Saren and his evil fucking face?!
[7:29:43] <jackelzxaa> :thumbsup:
[7:29:45] <+xerotwo> Conrad LUL
[7:29:57] <aiutare47> "learning her feet"
[7:30:07] <+jelzak> Im playing Vanguard in ME1 too rn, cant wait for ME2 and 3 Vanguard, it gets even more fun
[7:30:17] <Broken_Sonex> @AmericanSkidd "Tell me more....!" - Uncle Shepard
[7:30:17] <jackelzxaa> conrad is one of the best things in the trilogy lol
[7:30:22] <Jaysky> @Daigrey You can't say no to highlight blue cable chests
[7:30:23] <%DJFakie> You can murder this lady for being nothing but helpful and explanatory in this conversation
[7:30:43] <%Monkeyweed21> I will become the village bicycle
[7:30:44] <%AbnormalVoid> You....did it
[7:30:48] <Samurai_Tchan> "we ang okay"
[7:30:50] <%X2Eliah> you did it
[7:30:58] <JetpackMcQuack> Thank god we're boring again
[7:31:01] <RichardSilverShadow> Is it just me, or is the audio getting softer and louder randomly? (of the npcs)
[7:31:05] <aiutare47> oh yeah I forgot there was a jarring smash cut to this
[7:31:08] <Brothermanhyll> Hey tuck
[7:31:10] <ketchuo13> Most?
[7:31:12] <+AFellowDegen> "I'm basically the best" - Pasragon points swap with renegade
[7:31:16] <%X2Eliah> @RichardSilverShadow sometimes yeah
[7:31:18] <%DJFakie> You did, but Fai Dan.
[7:31:18] <Dunmarkh> man shot himself in the head
[7:31:19] <karl_rex> Man this colony gets really fucked over
[7:31:21] <%StaceMcGate> Quark is dead Pat
[7:31:22] <%peanutdot007> Except that one who shot himself
[7:31:24] <%zyberion626> Fai dan did shoot himself
[7:31:24] <$lotharrio> Are they counting the ones who died before you got there?
[7:31:24] <%emperordread> There was the leader no? Didn't he pop himself
[7:31:25] <+Daigrey> @Daigrey i can if it gives me an obvious evil face and I'm an obvious evil guy
[7:31:26] <Jaysky> Their leader died
[7:31:27] <%DianaTheAscian> but that one guy
[7:31:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Fai Dan
[7:31:27] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt You didn't save Fai Dang
[7:31:27] <Samurai_Tchan> kotor vibes
[7:31:31] <%ForlornCarton> Well, the one did shoot himself.
[7:31:32] <+ReiDuran> Corporations don't learn
[7:31:34] <jackelzxaa> "I saved all of the infected" as he stands on fai dan's body
[7:31:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Well except that one guy
[7:31:35] <+Punchasaur> @drawdehellfire you’d be antsy after being possessed
[7:31:38] <%DJFakie> Nope!
[7:31:38] <ketchuo13> Noper
[7:31:39] <jackelzxaa> nah
[7:31:39] <aiutare47> @RichardSilverShadow it has to do with the audio channels I think, they are loudest when the camera is pointing at them
[7:31:40] <+AFellowDegen> no
[7:31:40] <%StaceMcGate> nope
[7:31:40] <+CowsRTasty> nope
[7:31:41] <jackelzxaa> faidan always dies
[7:31:42] <%zyberion626> nope
[7:31:44] <%X2Eliah> nope
[7:31:46] <RichardSilverShadow> @X2Eliah Ah how odd for a remaster or whatever it is. Seems like an easy fix.
[7:31:47] <Samurai_Tchan> jenkis
[7:31:51] <%Monkeyweed21> I will become the village bicycle for the greater good
[7:32:02] <jackelzxaa> me2 does accurately remember how you handled feros though (i think 3 does too but it's a minor thing)
[7:32:03] <Samurai_Tchan> HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[7:32:04] <%emperordread> The game 100% missed a trick by not ticking the "enthralled colonists" meter down by 1 after quark died
[7:32:06] <Samurai_Tchan> his face
[7:32:08] <Brothermanhyll> Pat have you seen that David Cage lawsuit thing
[7:32:09] <RichardSilverShadow> @aiutare47 Audio channels, hmn. No clue, so this is the stream or the game?

[7:33:55] <$decent_gaming> Shep is always down for mind sex
[7:33:56] <%MisterRockett> She's gonna learn all your kinks.
[7:33:57] <jackelzxaa> doing feros here means you just see this twice in a row, it's weird

[7:34:38] <ianabstract> "IF you let ashley get this she would have folded like wet TP"
[7:34:38] <$lotharrio> Liara is just making shit up to make you seem cool.
[7:34:52] <Samurai_Tchan> @peanutdot007 hahhaha
[7:34:57] <JetpackMcQuack> I saw a lot and I wasn't impressed
[7:35:00] <%StaceMcGate> Is she the same VO as Aegis?
[7:35:01] <beefcakemanthrob> mind sex so good she's exhausted
[7:35:02] <Brothermanhyll> Liara I was healed from a brick of coal that one time
[7:35:02] <%X2Eliah> WHOA

[7:35:37] <arkv01> @xerotwo I'm rock hard now
[7:35:37] <%zyberion626> the hilarious thing is that if you talk to Liara, you get a repeat of her intro dialogue
[7:35:37] <KeiPrime> destiny is destiny, commander
[7:35:38] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat legally has to say it like that
[7:35:39] <Covil91> You're the bottom
[7:35:39] <Bail_Seven> legendary does make her look tired

[7:37:04] <%dekkitout> Honestly, Shep needs to have an elaborate hoax voicemail for the council
[7:37:06] <%DJFakie> Pat said he wasn't going to do it, and he did it!
[7:37:08] <$realm_forge> THUG LIFE
[7:37:09] <ketchuo13> Back we go
[7:37:11] <%zyberion626> they call right back
[7:37:15] <jackelzxaa> joker does have something to say after every mission, anderson does too but you have to go all the way back to the citadel to see it
[7:37:17] <%peanutdot007> Shepard just had two rounds of brain sex and hung up on his bosses. Living his best life.
[7:37:19] <+mlow44> Pat turned down a chance to NARC?
[7:37:20] <NeroInfinite> @Bail_Seven Kinda boring tbh
[7:37:21] <%DJFakie> Well this is awkward.
[7:37:22] <+justianxix> BACK AGAIN

[7:37:42] <+D00msDayDan> disconnect again
[7:37:42] <jackelzxaa> the holograms of the council look so much better now
[7:37:45] <%Atomik456> it even makes ME2 make a lot more sense
[7:37:55] <%zyberion626> this call doesn't have Sparatus, so the Council is actually chill this time
[7:37:59] <metabot64> Why does shepard look like pat?
[7:38:02] <NeroInfinite> they acually look like holograms now
[7:38:20] <$realm_forge> Hang up on them like a Bell sales rep
[7:38:21] <Sigma_190_Beta> @metabot64 Because Uncle pat wanted himself in the game.
[7:38:27] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[7:38:28] <%Atomik456> cutting off the council constantly
[7:38:29] <+xerotwo> HMMMMMMM
[7:38:34] <aiutare47> whoa Virmire is way sooner than I remember
[7:38:35] <%DJFakie> Joker references it, even if you never did
[7:38:35] <+xerotwo> LUL
[7:38:35] <%Monkeyweed21> being a shit to the council
[7:38:48] <akitanito> I'm surprised they are this cordial
[7:38:48] <%MisterRockett> That's such a shitty way of wording it. "Concerning your interest in Seren, come help us out with this."
[7:39:01] <+AFellowDegen> Being a dick in ME1 is cannon
[7:39:09] <%emperordread> "Peppered" if you will
[7:39:10] <Basch71> shepard memeing on the council is canon LUL
[7:39:13] <mak0t0yukii> Pat Sheperd
[7:39:14] <arkv01> its hilarious seeing pat slime his way into alien vaginas
[7:39:17] <%UvBenServed> Uncle Pat
[7:39:17] <RetributionP> being a funny dick
[7:39:22] <Broken_Sonex> Uncle Patrick/Shepard
[7:39:26] <ketchuo13> Say did they change how you get Spectre gear?
[7:39:31] <$realm_forge> Shepard starts ME2 with early stage dementia from the asari brain sex
[7:39:33] <+mlow44> ShepPat
[7:39:33] <Lamokmok> You don't like Uncle Pat?
[7:39:35] <Dabrikishaw> EVERYONE makes themselves at least once. My Shepard is a black guy with cornrolls.
[7:39:35] <%DJFakie> Liara and Joker have a bit about hanging up on the council in ME3 too
[7:39:37] <jackelzxaa> i wonder what anderson and udina have to say about the thorian
[7:39:37] <%zyberion626> @akitanito honestly, it's only Sparatus that's a constant dick. The Asari and Salarian councillors are reasonable if you aren't an asshat
[7:39:45] <geassguy360> femshep always
[7:39:49] <%X2Eliah> huh i thougfht you did the second bunch a missions after getiing liara
[7:39:49] <%Wallabri> it's past his bedtime!!
[7:39:51] <RetributionP> tall uncle pat
[7:39:53] <%X2Eliah> oh well
[7:40:06] <Dabrikishaw> Granted, I don't have cornrolls anymore, but the point still stands
[7:40:06] <+Daigrey> I M M E R S I O N
[7:40:11] <%Ranryu692> it's so you can see the shape of the nebula
[7:40:13] <%DianaTheAscian> oh a bunch of ex Atlus devs are making a new rpg
[7:40:14] <aiutare47> Thats one of my favourite Joker lines too "You wanna call the council and hang up again, just for old times sake?"
[7:40:16] <%Ranryu692> I would assume
[7:40:16] <$realm_forge> Zangeif is technically a non nutonian fluid
[7:40:21] <jackelzxaa> pat shepard is actually using biotics to make himself seem taller
[7:40:27] <+Punchasaur> Would you guys prefer rando johnson over Pat shep
[7:40:40] <%dekkitout> Larry and Garry time
[7:41:06] <CurrySauseBandit> Who cares so long as you enjoy YOUR character.
[7:41:08] <akitanito> don't need no lockpick huh
[7:41:08] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[7:41:13] <cgreene64> y would you tho
[7:41:15] <+Punchasaur> Like what other character would he make
[7:41:17] <$realm_forge> Does Liara put Shepard’s brain in little fuzzy brain handcuffs every time?
[7:41:17] <RetributionP> you can't see pats legs so yeah he is probably floating like a whole meter off the ground
[7:41:26] <Profmcstevie> Lockpick chicken and lockpick suit
[7:41:30] <jackelzxaa> if you pick decryption as a bonus tallent you can cover that stat yourself and then liara and wrex becomes viable since she only has electronics
[7:41:36] <+GuilKato> but Pat you have doomed yourself now you have to CHOOSE! which means you will be leaving someone on the ship
[7:41:41] <+GuilKato> and not able to justify it
[7:41:43] <extradopeness> oh my god i just saw your chatacter in the thumbnail and had to come laugh
[7:41:47] <%DJFakie> First Aid counts everyone's skills
[7:41:52] <+Punchasaur> Especially in THIS character creator
[7:42:22] <%DJFakie> If everyone's maxed on First Aid you basically get 100% heals

[7:44:35] <$lotharrio> Hey everyone. Let's have a ten minute conversation while the elevator works.
[7:44:36] <smallheals> enjoy the game pat im of to my work
[7:44:37] <+athuramn> yeah saren, payyyyy
[7:44:42] <%Atomik456> tbf liara doesnt really have any combat training, it's kind of miracle she never shoots someone
[7:44:48] <Samurai_Tchan> "lets fuck here shepard, maake garus watchi"" hahaha
[7:44:54] <jackelzxaa> as much as people hate ashley, i do think it's actually kind of unique to have a modern day earth religion make it into the space future.  i can't think of anything else that ever did that.
[7:45:03] <Dabrikishaw> @smallheals Holy shit you work at 2:30 am?
[7:45:07] <Brothermanhyll> “I would prefer more bangin”
[7:45:21] <%PikeBot> @jackelzxaa Babylon 5
[7:45:32] <jackelzxaa> oh really?
[7:45:36] <tanarath> Sell her enough shit to finance a large war
[7:45:38] <%X2Eliah> wow
[7:45:46] <VectMachine> Space Quebec... No...
[7:45:46] <%DJFakie> Cash caps out at 9.99 million
[7:45:49] <%Atomik456> @jackelzxaa honestly i really loved the lore tidbit that Buddhism really took off among the Turians. We never really see it in game sadly
[7:45:53] <JetpackMcQuack> that's a big number
[7:45:55] <%PikeBot> Yeah, Ivanov’s is explicitly Jewish
[7:45:57] <Profmcstevie> Nice heavy pockets now
[7:46:02] <smallheals> @Dabrikishaw  its 08.37 in jolland mate
[7:46:08] <%PikeBot> *Ivanova
[7:46:12] <%DJFakie> Yeah, those regens get really good! I set them and forget them
[7:46:16] <tanarath> @djfakie I wish you could contract barla von at cap.
[7:46:20] <+AmericanSkidd> turn it all into goo
[7:46:21] <jackelzxaa> it took me so long to figure out what some of these stats actually did
[7:46:23] <smallheals> ..holland
[7:46:31] <RetributionP> just don't get poisoned pat
[7:46:58] <tanarath> Anything below 4, omnigel
[7:47:06] <%PikeBot> God the inventory and menus in ME1 are really just decried ass
[7:47:06] <+SinisterBroccoli> Wow surprised you're still at it pat
[7:47:24] <%DJFakie> @tanarath He's got so much gel though and we're in the back half, NBD
[7:47:38] <jackelzxaa> theres only....3 moments in the rest of the game where thorian gas is useful again and they're both side missions
[7:47:43] <Profmcstevie> I hope we get armour that doesn't have fucking flashing christmas lights on them, it's distracting as all hell LUL
[7:47:43] <$lotharrio> So what are you gonna spend all that money on?
[7:47:44] <tanarath> True
[7:47:45] <plankk56> i thought grenades were busted in this game?
[7:47:53] <Written_Saber> how much do you need for the Specter weapons?
[7:47:55] <jackelzxaa> unless i'm misremembering a husks encounter as creepers
[7:47:58] <KeystoneA2> You should have Master Gear unlocked now I think
[7:48:05] <%X2Eliah> @plankk56 everything is busted in this game
[7:48:15] <+AmericanSkidd> a lot
[7:48:18] <KeystoneA2> 1 million, originally
[7:48:19] <%DJFakie> A full set of Spectre X is about 6 million @PatStaresAt
[7:48:26] <tanarath> 250k each for initial spectre stuff
[7:48:30] <jackelzxaa> oh the bug is real
[7:48:37] <FennecZephyr> Apart from the license, tghat all looks like crap
[7:48:39] <%X2Eliah> LUL get effed
[7:48:41] <tanarath> like 1mil or more for the final stuff
[7:48:45] <%Monkeyweed21> TIME TO FIX THAT BUG
[7:48:45] <KeystoneA2> Buy the Kassa License. Best armor in the game
[7:48:47] <jackelzxaa> that's nuts
[7:48:50] <+AmericanSkidd> hes holding out on you, beat him
[7:48:54] <%X2Eliah> tis loading thing is crazy
[7:48:55] <jackelzxaa> time to go become a spectre again
[7:49:02] <TapAtoLive> TOO FAR BACK
[7:49:04] <%DJFakie> For anyone that doesn't know, we have to re-seed the guns into the shop
[7:49:05] <Jaysky> Wut
[7:49:05] <yojohny> Haha does this work?
[7:49:08] <%dekkitout> Time to restore the timeline!
[7:49:09] <%DJFakie> By re-becoming a Spectre
[7:49:10] <ketchuo13> Wait what
[7:49:10] <KeiPrime> what
[7:49:12] <+GuilKato> WTf?
[7:49:13] <CurrySauseBandit> @plankk56 Iirc grenades can literally insta-clear rooms. Haven't played me1 since release though.
[7:49:14] <jackelzxaa> do spectre weapons not show up on the normandy shop either because of the bug?
[7:49:15] <%notmicrowavesafe> notmicrowavesafe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! got me a new job, can now resubscribe to this. Keepin this train rollin.
[7:49:16] <$realm_forge> GOOD GUN BUGGED TIME FOR MAN TANTRUM
[7:49:18] <Lamokmok> Lol
[7:49:19] <+GuilKato> this was long ago
[7:49:20] <$lotharrio> "Your proof isn't PROOFY enough."
[7:49:21] <Dabrikishaw> OOh, Pat's actually doing the bugfix
[7:49:25] <+AmericanSkidd> time travel to buy a pretty good gun
[7:49:25] <+GuilKato> I am very confused
[7:49:27] <Samurai_Tchan> WHY IS HE DOING ALL AGAIN
[7:49:29] <+D00msDayDan> i was really confused for a second
[7:49:30] <+GuilKato> the hell
[7:49:33] <%X2Eliah> Its ok pat will just redo the last 16 hours xD
[7:49:33] <%dekkitout> King Crimson!!
[7:49:35] <+SinisterBroccoli> What's going on?
[7:49:36] <neon_z1> whatever whatever
[7:49:36] <%DJFakie> @jackelzxaa Only the first possible time, when you can't afford them
[7:49:36] <Samurai_Tchan> WHY
[7:49:38] <aiutare47> Good music though
[7:49:41] <+GuilKato> did my twitch start playing old video?
[7:49:41] <Sigma_190_Beta> OH, THIS IS THE BUG FIX!
[7:49:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> and one step closer to the edge, imma bout to break
[7:49:50] <+GuilKato> oh the rarestocks bug
[7:49:50] <otakon17> the hell
[7:49:52] <Samurai_Tchan> he was so much ahead of the game
[7:49:52] <+GuilKato> I gotcha!
[7:49:54] <otakon17> did you beat the game already?
[7:49:54] <%AzureGale> Wait what happen
[7:49:58] <CurrySauseBandit> @plankk56 Not that it matters in normal. Since shit just....dies.
[7:49:59] <%DJFakie> @Samurai_Tchan We have to get the Spectre guns back in the shop, so we have to tell the game to put them in by playing this cutscene
[7:50:01] <+GuilKato> you're loading an old file to load into ram
[7:50:02] <+AmericanSkidd> wake me up inside
[7:50:03] <otakon17> how'd you do Zhu's Hope BEFORE this?
[7:50:03] <tanarath> @fenneczephyr in the original game, extra licenses diluted the merch pool. only the best was the right way to go.
[7:50:05] <+GuilKato> so you can then reload other save
[7:50:05] <thatpurplefunk> hey were aliens
[7:50:07] <%X2Eliah> game completed
[7:50:08] <+GuilKato> and get guns
[7:50:11] <+GuilKato> I understand now
[7:50:12] <jackelzxaa> saren phones in at the last second "Actually that was just a play benezia and i were going to throw for....batarian orphans." and then the council immediately believes him and cancels shepard's spectreship
[7:50:13] <Shade075> only 4 people watching this momentous occasion LUL
[7:50:15] <aiutare47> So to briefly explain chat, Pat needs to just redo this scene then reload to fix the Spectre gear bug
[7:50:16] <Broken_Sonex> ....OHHHHH, he's doing the bug fix
[7:50:17] <thatpurplefunk> alien guns
[7:50:22] <ketchuo13> cool cool, now where's my GUN

[7:51:31] <otakon17> ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?
[7:51:32] <%DJFakie> Buy 'em all, why not, you're loaded
[7:51:34] <+Daigrey> not X, but still
[7:51:36] <tanarath> ok, save & load your old game
[7:51:37] <otakon17> WHY HASN'T THIS BEEN PATCHED YET!?
[7:51:41] <%captainpodock> Gun? Gun.
[7:51:42] <jackelzxaa> get extras for garrus
[7:51:42] <+Phantasos12> "give gun" is not a recognized command
[7:51:42] <$realm_forge> This is what happens when you have too much brain sex
[7:51:44] <otakon17> oh it's only like 300K for  agun
[7:51:44] <%DJFakie> @athuramn This loaded the Spectre-grade gunsback in the game
[7:51:50] <$Hommando> Those guns are broken
[7:51:50] <tanarath> IT'S ALSO STUPID GOFF
[7:51:52] <NeroInfinite> the ebst of the best
[7:51:53] <otakon17> still the best you can get in the first playthrough is VII
[7:51:55] <jackelzxaa> these are the guns you use for the rest of the game
[7:51:55] <+AmericanSkidd> its worth it
[7:51:56] <ketchuo13> Okay, so according to the wiki, you need to do Virmire
[7:51:56] <tanarath> good*
[7:51:59] <%DJFakie> It's 1 million for all, you've got 3 mil
[7:51:59] <Samurai_Tchan> i hate this new age music from here
[7:52:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> those guns look like suitcases
[7:52:04] <thatpurplefunk> space alien guns cost money
[7:52:05] <$lotharrio> Your thing first and then something you can swap around to the others.
[7:52:08] <otakon17> wait till you see rank 10 guns
[7:52:08] <+athuramn> and they left or weren't there before? @DJFakie
[7:52:09] <jackelzxaa> you don't need to spend money on anything else until you can get the level X versions
[7:52:13] <otakon17> oh dude they look SO much better
[7:52:14] <%dekkitout> ...
[7:52:14] <akitanito> you have 3 mil
[7:52:15] <jackelzxaa> no thats 7 digits
[7:52:17] <%dekkitout> ME TOO
[7:52:19] <KeiPrime> ...
[7:52:19] <%DJFakie> All good, man!

[7:52:31] <jackelzxaa> the spectre guns are all a unique color too
[7:52:32] <Dabrikishaw> rolling in money
[7:52:33] <%DJFakie> psaUp
[7:52:35] <yojohny> No shit idiot
[7:52:35] <otakon17> the HMWSG guns are the best in the game
[7:52:36] <%DJFakie> Yes!
[7:52:37] <Enajy314> LUL
[7:52:37] <%UvBenServed> psaBlind
[7:52:38] <jackelzxaa> so having them all makes you look really cool
[7:52:38] <+iAmAceGaming> i thought the lvls went up to X?
[7:52:40] <%DianaTheAscian> thats a quote
[7:52:42] <%MaxeusTheFirst> LUL LUL LUL
[7:52:42] <jackelzxaa> get all gun
[7:52:43] <+AmericanSkidd> this gun is worth more than your life
[7:52:44] <thatpurplefunk> death stranding: GIVE GUN
[7:52:44] <tanarath> Get two shotties
[7:52:47] <otakon17> might as well
[7:52:49] <%DJFakie> No, just 7 and 10
[7:52:50] <+Daigrey> up to X
[7:52:50] <jackelzxaa> just 7 and 10
[7:52:50] <tanarath> and a pistol
[7:52:53] <RetributionP> 0/10 brain
[7:52:54] <$lotharrio> There's just the rank 10 I'm told.
[7:52:55] <tanarath> 7 then 10
[7:52:55] <otakon17> that'll only be like half your money
[7:52:58] <+Dreadknight297> just 7 and 10
[7:53:02] <$lotharrio> And that requires level 50.
[7:53:03] <Dabrikishaw> 7 and 10
[7:53:03] <otakon17> nope, only rank VII and then X
[7:53:10] <otakon17> and you only get 10 in NG+
[7:53:14] <tanarath> Get two shotties
[7:53:26] <otakon17> but the Rank 7's WILL be the best guns you'll get in the first playthrough EASILY
[7:53:27] <jackelzxaa> give a shotgun to tali
[7:53:27] <@SpaceCapnCrone> but you have TWO HANDS
[7:53:27] <%notmicrowavesafe> ***
[7:53:30] <+GrandmasterBFunk> you just tore a piece of your cat out wtf
[7:53:30] <%X2Eliah> pat did you just pull something out of Elmo's ass?
[7:53:32] <tanarath> Wrex + vanguard shep
[7:53:36] <jackelzxaa> one for you one for a friend
[7:53:36] <+AmericanSkidd> squad doesnt get nice things?
[7:53:41] <Dabrikishaw> @lotharrio No, now you have to get locked into the Citadel instead by beating all 4 planets
[7:53:42] <%DJFakie> You'll have enough for X by the time it procs, probably
[7:53:43] <otakon17> alas, no dual wielding shotties in this
[7:53:49] <otakon17> one for you, one for squaddy
[7:53:50] <FennecZephyr> I swear they revamped the NG+ mechanics in the remaster
[7:53:50] <tanarath> He can use both
[7:53:56] <%DJFakie> That works!
[7:53:57] <%DianaTheAscian> oh boy was Pat not kidding when he said this was gonna be a long one
[7:53:58] <otakon17> you made Wrex an AR guy
[7:54:00] <%notmicrowavesafe> Shit, my GIVE GUN clip.
[7:54:03] <tanarath> Eh, do whatever
[7:54:04] <$lotharrio> Ah didn't know.
[7:54:05] <otakon17> Garrus ALWAYS gets a Sniper
[7:54:06] <%notmicrowavesafe> hope it went through alright
[7:54:07] <+Allyofwar> @otakon17 actually you unlock rank X after virmire in legendary edition.
[7:54:07] <+GuilKato> you can get multiple of them
[7:54:07] <otakon17> period
[7:54:08] <%X2Eliah> yeah why not
[7:54:15] <+GuilKato> so you could come back after money to buy more
[7:54:18] <otakon17> oh ho
[7:54:21] <otakon17> I didn't know that
[7:54:25] <tanarath> They kinda buffed ar it seems
[7:54:26] <+GuilKato> and give all your crew except space racist the gear
[7:54:26] <%X2Eliah> garrus def gets sniper; wrex is kinda half/half assault/shotty but you use shotty so
[7:54:29] <jackelzxaa> i always just use all 4 because they look cool on your back anyways
[7:54:29] <Kghaleon> I could never find the X weapons, dunno why they never appeared.
[7:54:33] <KeystoneA2> Get the sniper and equip it with explosive rounds -- it's like having a Mako cannon in your hands
[7:54:33] <jackelzxaa> theyre all black
[7:54:35] <%notmicrowavesafe> ***
[7:54:37] <+mikesapartment> what the heck it's been 8 hours
[7:54:38] <tanarath> Ar used to be absolute trash
[7:54:38] <otakon17> I usually make Wrex pointman with a shottie since he has REALLY high HP/DR and Barrier
[7:54:46] <%DJFakie> Congrats, this game is now busted completely open
[7:54:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt dont forget the license
[7:54:53] <%DJFakie> The AR accuracy is LUDICROUS
[7:54:54] <%notmicrowavesafe> dammit, not working here wack
[7:54:57] <otakon17> ^
[7:55:00] <tanarath> Pat look for frictionless materials now
[7:55:05] <Dabrikishaw> There's a reason Spectre's have to but their own gear
[7:55:07] <Profmcstevie> If the fuckers didn't melt before they will now
[7:55:10] <otakon17> DEFINITELY get the license so Normandy requisitions officer can get them
[7:55:29] <otakon17> shame you don't have any high explosive rounds
[7:55:31] <+Daigrey> get license
[7:55:33] <akitanito> big damage
[7:55:34] <+AmericanSkidd> these guns together costs almost as much as reviving shepard
[7:55:36] <otakon17> they would REALLY push the damange through the roof
[7:55:39] <%X2Eliah> Big dadmage
[7:55:45] <aiutare47> pistol does as much damage as the shotgun?
[7:55:50] <tanarath> YEAH
[7:55:51] <%notmicrowavesafe> big exccite
[7:55:52] <%DJFakie> It's awesome, right?!
[7:55:55] <mak0t0yukii> YEAAAAAH
[7:55:55] <laughinjester> damn
[7:55:56] <%dekkitout> That's a good spread pattern
[7:55:56] <%AzureGale> Get rekt
[7:55:57] <Jaysky> It's not broken it's fine
[7:55:57] <otakon17> +52% damage for -40% the fire rate
[7:55:58] <Samurai_Tchan> your gonna pay for that wall
[7:56:00] <derap41> Now we can kill god
[7:56:04] <%UvBenServed> PogChamp
[7:56:05] <%Ynkubus_> Pat proceeds to level the ward
[7:56:09] <NeroInfinite> YEAH IT'S DUMB AIN'T IT?
[7:56:11] <%moonmintparadise> HELL YEAH
[7:56:16] <otakon17> Now, WE SHOOT SOVEREIGN IN THE FACE
[7:56:16] <tanarath> So Pat, ME 1's system sucks, right?
[7:56:17] <mak0t0yukii> YEAH THAT SO GOOD
[7:56:21] <KnightOfTrousers> The fuck is this gun?!
[7:56:23] <Samurai_Tchan> unstopable
[7:56:33] <%Monkeyweed21> heat not fire rate
[7:56:40] <%DJFakie> You'll eventually get a damage upgrade that also LOWERS heat
[7:56:41] <jackelzxaa> the problem with good mods is you start to run into heating problems, so it does help to have multiple guns to fall back on, also enemies that use tech skills can overload your current weapon
[7:56:42] <NeroInfinite> It's a space street sweeper.
[7:56:44] <Dabrikishaw> Snowblind rounds are underrated I found
[7:57:10] <%UvBenServed> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[7:57:11] <%DJFakie> psaWink
[7:57:12] <jackelzxaa> liara does have pistol specialization but you do basically bring her for lore and singularity
[7:57:15] <%moonmintparadise> elmo
[7:57:23] <%moonmintparadise> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[7:57:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> pet cat
[7:57:47] <Dabrikishaw> The hit to fire rate is worth it on high level guns because they never over heat even with Scram Rails
[7:57:49] <tanarath> I used antipersonnel & anti machine + cryo
[7:58:03] <+AmericanSkidd> These cost more than Joker will ever make in his entire life
[7:58:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> elmo D:
[7:58:09] <%DJFakie> It is a pain to switch, for sure
[7:58:13] <%R3Roundabout> Elmo deserves pets
[7:58:13] <jackelzxaa> dont forget to talk to anderson before you leave
[7:58:26] <tanarath> Scram rails were great
[7:58:28] <aiutare47> having back ups for long range or for sabotage is useful, especially in the harder fights, having a good back up pistol is good
[7:58:35] <$lotharrio> "Hey Joker, check it out. With all the money I spent on these guns, I could have bought you a new skeleton."
[7:58:43] <jackelzxaa> anderson and joker talk about each of the main plot missions as well as the 6 squadmates
[7:58:52] <jackelzxaa> but anderson is a pain in the ass to get to
[7:58:53] <%X2Eliah> You might as well talk to everyone on the ship
[7:58:59] <jackelzxaa> so no one does it
[7:59:22] <%SirGO0SE> just a scoop Kappa
[7:59:34] <+AmericanSkidd> @lotharrio "Maybe even 3 extra for spares"
[7:59:39] <jackelzxaa> they shoulda patched in a skateboard so shepard could get around the citadel faster
[7:59:43] <Written_Saber> Shepard. Wrex
[7:59:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i thought tali uses shotguns
[8:00:11] <+SinisterBroccoli> what do you think of Tali's redesign in ME2?
[8:00:17] <%X2Eliah> @cobalt_phoenix_ Shotguns/pistols
[8:00:25] <Kghaleon> Pat's streams are the only time I see frame skips and audio bugs.
[8:00:28] <%DJFakie> It's so easy to forget to upgrade squad attachments, there's so many attachments
[8:00:29] <jackelzxaa> tali uses pistols and shotty, wrex is assault rifles and shotty, garrus is assault rifle and sniper, liara is pistol, kaiden is pistol, ashley is all 4 guns.
[8:01:01] <Dabrikishaw> Calling Kaiden a pistol user is being kind
[8:01:09] <%Monkeyweed21> the top one is the equipped
[8:01:18] <%X2Eliah> !uptime
[8:01:20] <+AmericanSkidd> How much are these guns in Krogan Testicles?
[8:01:24] <RetributionP> wrex
[8:01:32] <%X2Eliah> moobot you lazy bum
[8:01:37] <%Monkeyweed21> give Liara Tali's old pistol
[8:01:41] <Dabrikishaw> I kept Kaiden on Shotguns and Assault Rifles for most of my playthrough
[8:01:44] <mak0t0yukii> YEAAAH
[8:01:44] <%DJFakie> Yeah! Yeah!!
[8:01:46] <%dekkitout> Do that again

[8:01:56] <aiutare47> no you didnt
[8:02:05] <%X2Eliah> ?
[8:02:05] <aiutare47> crossfire was wrexs old gun
[8:02:17] <jackelzxaa> crossfire isn't the spectre gun
[8:02:18] <%Monkeyweed21> thats his old gun
[8:02:20] <aiutare47> wrex has the spectre assault rifle
[8:02:22] <%X2Eliah> omg LUL
[8:02:31] <$lotharrio> I'm curious, but your Requisitions Officer doesn't have his own inventory with Spectre gear, right?
[8:02:31] <Lamokmok> Crossfire is his old gun
[8:02:32] <%DJFakie> It's late, it's OK
[8:02:33] <RetributionP> uuuugh
[8:02:40] <jackelzxaa> wrex is the first krogan spectre
[8:02:47] <jackelzxaa> you can tell because he has a spectre gun
[8:02:51] <aiutare47> its 3am, youre excused

[8:04:02] <Lamokmok> Admiral Goku
[8:04:04] <tanarath> You have to talk to Anderson before taking to admiral kohaku
[8:04:12] <+AmericanSkidd> His number wasn't big enough
[8:04:15] <%DJFakie> Cleanest inventory on Twitch
[8:04:31] <%DJFakie> Not much
[8:04:40] <jackelzxaa> theres more citadel stuff at the VERY end of the game but thats it
[8:04:45] <aiutare47> if it makes you feel any better the Banes quest goes absolutely no where and youve missed nothing
[8:04:47] <%X2Eliah> I dont think theres anything left
[8:04:51] <jackelzxaa> they add 2 npc's when you get locked down
[8:04:56] <%X2Eliah> not until you get locked here
[8:04:58] <%DJFakie> You get two quests right before you leave Citadel for the last time

[8:05:47] <+thecosmicfly> What accent does Udina have anyway?
[8:05:47] <+Ghufufin> is it just me or did he sound Scottish there?
[8:05:47] <Written_Saber> He sounds more Irish then I remember...
[8:05:48] <parkslady> he seriously is
[8:05:54] <Samurai_Tchan> he is a creepy
[8:05:55] <aiutare47> why did they give him a meat smack]
[8:05:57] <%X2Eliah> udina did nothing wrong
[8:06:01] <+Kindan55> Yep
[8:06:03] <crookedfinger68> FAX
[8:06:05] <ianabstract> He does a good job but he's a jackass about it
[8:06:06] <+Name_Meme> He just loves humanity
[8:06:06] <+Kingtut9009> Oh god the Anderson looks friggin awful
[8:06:08] <+AmericanSkidd> I wonder at what point he gets in Cerberus's pocket?
[8:06:08] <tanarath> He is, though
[8:06:10] <%X2Eliah> And Udina is super good in me3
[8:06:10] <jackelzxaa> it's wild they didnt make udina have more than a sliver of good quality to make the human councilor choice any difficult
[8:06:14] <%zyberion626> you represent all of humankind. IMMA BE A DICK
[8:06:15] <moonmeh> still dislike how his role ended up in me3
[8:06:16] <Profmcstevie> Buh I wanna go shooty baddies and dance with aliens BabyRage
[8:06:16] <Dabrikishaw> I'd like Udina more if Bioware didn't make him such a dick.
[8:06:21] <%dekkitout> RiP Admiral Keikaku
[8:06:40] <+Kindan55> Him being such a straight up cunt honestly makes it unrealistic he even has the job, gotta hide that scummy nature
[8:06:40] <Samaugsch2> If udina loves humanity so much, he should join cerberus
[8:06:43] <Phats_Mahoney> his death was according to plan
[8:06:49] <RetributionP> RIP Admiral Kikongo

[8:08:14] <%DJFakie> The consistent design is better, for sure
[8:08:16] <jackelzxaa> theres a full tier of unusable armor in this game
[8:08:16] <aiutare47> the whole no armor customization was dumb
[8:08:20] <+AmericanSkidd> It doesn't look like cheap cosplay
[8:08:20] <%Ranryu692> especially the Blood Dragon armor
[8:08:22] <jackelzxaa> joker

[8:08:33] <+SinisterBroccoli> I like the armor in ME2, but I do think the "create-a-suit" is a bit goofy looking
[8:08:36] <Jaysky> Still enjoy all the armors yes
[8:08:40] <RetributionP> the blood dragon armor was dope
[8:08:42] <%DJFakie> Word psaUp
[8:08:42] <jackelzxaa> ok

[8:15:07] <@SpaceCapnCrone> I no longer try.

[8:15:47] <KeiPrime> the game or the concept

[8:19:51] <%SaiyanShoto> You're too busy working on your own content
[8:19:54] <Profmcstevie> If you keep up with ONCE person that's all your spare time gone
[8:20:05] <Jaysky> The Pat guy!
[8:20:05] <%DJFakie> Talking to a friend of a friend who you share no interests with so there's no topics

[8:20:57] <%GarbageNirvana> This sounds like a Seinfeld bit
[8:20:58] <%SirGO0SE> like their "video from 6 years ago"
[8:20:58] <%DianaTheAscian> PAT THIS IS STARTING TO HURT STOP
[8:20:58] <majindusto> lol
[8:21:09] <thatpurplefunk> buttcheeks are weird
[8:21:10] <+JustToWatch> I've followed him on Twitter for 5 years and I'm still not entirely sure what he does
[8:21:13] <jackelzxaa> i'm petting my corgi on my lap because his tummy is big and fat
[8:21:22] <+Punchasaur> He had the brains to get the fuck away from normal boots
[8:21:22] <$realm_forge> Pat is a social butterfly
[8:21:28] <JetpackMcQuack> shit's weird
[8:21:29] <%dekkitout> This is why its good to spec into small talk
[8:21:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Wonder if he thought you were a bald child like a lot of people think when they see you in public LUL
[8:21:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> @GarbageNirvana I think Pat is a Seinfeld bit.
[8:21:48] <Profmcstevie> Charm stat plummeting
[8:21:54] <Jaysky> Things
[8:21:57] <@SpaceCapnCrone> He's a professional Renaissance Man
[8:21:57] <JetpackMcQuack> He vanished
[8:22:06] <neon_z1> good
[8:22:08] <JetpackMcQuack> to better things i'm sure
[8:22:14] <leinadtonu> He may be a spy...
[8:22:22] <Jaysky> Fuck does Cuno care
[8:22:31] <+glgzephyr> elmo sleepy
[8:22:44] <%kewlmyc> ?

[8:23:02] <aiutare47> favorite Race in ME?
[8:23:04] <%AbnormalVoid> plose it up
[8:23:07] <+UltraFist0> thornt1HCF
[8:23:07] <%DianaTheAscian> its a starbucks joke i think
[8:23:11] <%Ranryu692> that wasn't very dank of him
[8:23:21] <%emperordread> Patrick Boing is pretty lit tbh
[8:23:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat is boin boin?
[8:23:25] <SomersaultJustice> patrick boing
[8:23:25] <Profmcstevie> Boibin
[8:23:26] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat Boiin
[8:23:27] <BurdRightsActivist> BOOOOinn
[8:23:28] <%AbnormalVoid> really shove it through your nose
[8:23:29] <leinadtonu> boing
[8:23:34] <+JustToWatch> BOIIN
[8:23:34] <jackelzxaa> remember when mass effect andromeda had knuckles in it.  that was no one's favorite alien race.
[8:23:34] <%Taisuru> Mechwarrior 5 got a LOT better
[8:23:54] <%emperordread> Fresh hot, it's temporary nature makes it more enticing
[8:23:57] <%dekkitout> In the oven or microwave?
[8:24:02] <%AbnormalVoid> it depends on the pizza, honestly
[8:24:08] <vilecrois> pizza is pizza it all goes in the face hole
[8:24:09] <Profmcstevie> That grease does NOT go down well cold imo
[8:24:22] <+Kingtut9009> Cold pizza can have its own unique taste
[8:24:24] <jackelzxaa> the only pizza brand i genuinely liked, Mama Rosa's, got discontinued this year because covid destroyed their business.
[8:24:25] <%Taisuru> psaPorgmo
[8:24:31] <%Taisuru> RIP Gief
[8:24:47] <%Robot_Nixon_> @dekkitout DansGame stove top is the real mvp
[8:25:06] <%DJFakie> The boys for the raid, I like it
[8:25:21] <jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt are you gonna do a stream to do mako cleanup with?
[8:25:26] <%Taisuru> Can we go Ashley and.. Carth to a meat grinder?
[8:25:31] <arkv01> damned dirty apes
[8:25:31] <%castlerock42> I'd still consider Liara and Wrex for Noveria considering the enemies.
[8:25:34] <%THATGUY_789> boomans
[8:25:50] <NitronStreams> It sure is strange they didnt put any human party members in the game 😏
[8:25:58] <%DianaTheAscian> Some of them are kinda fucy
[8:26:01] <%DianaTheAscian> fucky*
[8:26:13] <jackelzxaa> ashley and kaiden do kinda get some decent materiel in me3 and the citadel dlc, including a good "everyone just shit on kaiden openly" joke
[8:26:35] <arkv01> you'll get a new and improved synthdog
[8:26:39] <Profmcstevie> Thou must love
[8:26:50] <Jaysky> We'll get a new family member
[8:27:22] <%SaiyanShoto> Humans are bitches
[8:27:24] <+Tredecian> jokers cool
[8:27:25] <+AFellowDegen> Miranda op
[8:27:25] <arkv01> just genocide all the humans
[8:27:27] <jackelzxaa> humans get better
[8:27:29] <%miguelrod777> Vegas ok
[8:27:31] <+glgzephyr> they wanted us to take the aliens LUL
[8:27:38] <%DianaTheAscian> are they're any good ones?
[8:27:42] <+Kindan55> Why not like Jack?
[8:27:44] <tanarath> Jack is solid
[8:27:45] <jackelzxaa> jack gets alot better in 3 than she was in 2, but it's important that she was a pithy bitch in 2 for 3 to be as good as it is to her
[8:27:45] <%Xelhesia> jack is legit great in 3
[8:27:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Not one sympathetic
[8:27:49] <Vi_Stri> zaeed is pretty cool
[8:27:53] <+thecosmicfly> Ones a space racist, and one is not
[8:27:58] <Samurai_Tchan> jack is awesome
[8:28:00] <Profmcstevie> Who goes space adventuring with HUMAN PARTY MEMBERS anyway
[8:28:01] <+SinisterBroccoli> But like Jacob is pretty bad too tho
[8:28:09] <Lamokmok> I still think Jacob is the worst
[8:28:11] <geassguy360> lol jack is great
[8:28:13] <Samurai_Tchan> jack is a rebel
[8:28:14] <tanarath> She has a personality, a life, and reasons to exist.
[8:28:31] <%Taisuru> @Lamokmok Dude Jacob is AT LEAST better than Ashley
[8:28:31] <Jaysky> I completely forgot about the existence of the Jacob before you mentioned him earlier
[8:28:33] <Samurai_Tchan> i like grunt
[8:28:34] <JetpackMcQuack> Jack has heart
[8:28:38] <stantheman_97> i like Miranda and I think I remember liking Vega but it's been too long
[8:28:42] <Jaysky> Isn't Kasumi good?
[8:28:45] <+GuilKato> Wrex is also about having a quad and being awesome
[8:28:57] <Samurai_Tchan> garrus is the punisher
[8:29:22] <FennecZephyr> garrus is the bastard cop the ACAB people are talking about
[8:29:27] <geassguy360> how dare you say such things about garrus
[8:29:35] <otakon17> Garrus BECOMES the Punisher/Batman
[8:29:42] <jackelzxaa> "Garrus is a fascist" is so reductionist.  i don't see that at all.  he's just a vigilante.
[8:29:43] <+SinisterBroccoli> Garrus just wants to shoot the badguys
[8:29:45] <+glgzephyr> Biotics Bad
[8:29:47] <JetpackMcQuack> humans get virmine DansGame
[8:29:49] <+glgzephyr> Big Racism
[8:29:53] <tanarath> Kaiden have 1/2 each
[8:29:57] <%Xelhesia> ash is so bad
[8:30:02] <otakon17> one SHARED with Virmire
[8:30:02] <tanarath> Humans stuck
[8:30:03] <jackelzxaa> ashley's storyline is "find out about ashley's family"
[8:30:03] <arkv01> yeah I'm thinking humans are losers
[8:30:03] <%wizkid50000> she is NOT a racist jesus
[8:30:05] <vilecrois> me?
[8:30:10] <Jaysky> But later on they get mad at Shepard for living Pat!
[8:30:15] <otakon17> she's KINDA racist
[8:30:20] <+D00msDayDan> wait, i am?
[8:30:24] <+GuilKato> @wizkid50000 you're right shes SPACE Racist
[8:30:26] <otakon17> speciest really but she doesn't like aliens at first
[8:30:27] <jackelzxaa> ashley and kaiden do get some decent materiel in 3
[8:30:29] <+glgzephyr> She's pretty racist, dude
[8:30:31] <otakon17> also hi Elmo
[8:30:32] <tanarath> Maybe have different cultures? socio-economic shit?
[8:30:32] <jackelzxaa> ashley also gets a makeover in 3
[8:30:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Humans have the alliance, and it's gucchi
[8:30:37] <mrtRoll001> wrex looks like a crab
[8:30:39] <+justianxix> oh god I'm HUMAN
[8:30:41] <otakon17> Jack is great
[8:30:46] <%wizkid50000> @GuilKato NO! She is NOT!
[8:30:46] <RushUnplugged> every time people go "she's not racist" they ALWAYS forget all the awful shit she says and believes
[8:30:49] <otakon17> Wrex is a space turtle/alligator
[8:30:53] <ThDark> Zaeed is great though
[8:30:54] <otakon17> he's a space snapping turtle
[8:30:54] <+AFellowDegen> Family issue thread
[8:30:56] <TapAtoLive> That's Mass Effect future-proofing itself, Kaiden and Ashley will become interesting when aliens play the series LUL
[8:30:56] <tanarath> negative threads
[8:30:58] <Samurai_Tchan> jacob is just there
[8:31:02] <jackelzxaa> they do a good job of making fun of kaiden in 3
[8:31:02] <+Kingtut9009> Ashley is literally a friggin idiot in 3
[8:31:05] <+glgzephyr> Miranda has more than the other humans
[8:31:07] <%Ranryu692> her left cheek and her right cheek
[8:31:07] <otakon17> Jacob is just UPPER BODY STRENGTH he works for Cerberus, same as Miranda
[8:31:07] <bharcoot> Joker/Doc best humans
[8:31:09] <Jaysky> Miranda is fine
[8:31:09] <stantheman_97> i like his loyalty mission but everything else is meh
[8:31:11] <Lamokmok> Jacob sucks
[8:31:11] <+ReiDuran> Why the hell does everyone fanboy over 2 so much? 1 has a much better universe.
[8:31:16] <aiutare47> Jacob and Miranda have their parents
[8:31:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Shows where their priorities were
[8:31:19] <otakon17> Miranda has her clone daddy issues and Cerberus
[8:31:25] <geassguy360> Ashley literally considers Tali like a sister in ME3, she fuckin gets better
[8:31:27] <tanarath> But it's like three
[8:31:31] <jackelzxaa> jack gets a whole new thread in 3, without spoiling anything
[8:31:35] <otakon17> Jack has connections to Cerberus and she's a tortured soul
[8:31:36] <Jaysky> What about Kasumi Pat
[8:31:40] <+glgzephyr> it's better than nothing
[8:31:40] <$Jedted> @wizkid50000 Agreed.  there's A LOT more racist characters in the game than Ash
[8:31:47] <ThDark> Zaeed was literally the only human character I liked
[8:31:48] <+Tredecian> kasumi is cool
[8:31:53] <jackelzxaa> mass effect 3 did try to apologize for making kaiden and ashley boring in 1
[8:31:54] <Jaysky> I never did Kasumi either
[8:31:56] <otakon17> @jackelzxaa if you help Jack in ME2, I like how she turns out in 3. It makes me happy
[8:31:57] <Samurai_Tchan> you can kill zaiid
[8:32:03] <tanarath> Cerberus, horrible experimentation, and finding peace & moving on.
[8:32:05] <otakon17> Kasumi is a sexy Japanese cyborg thief
[8:32:09] <+justianxix> kasumi and zaiid are just cool
[8:32:13] <+thecosmicfly> At least Jack and Miranda's threads kinda cross paths
[8:32:16] <otakon17> ZAEED IS FUCKING GREAT
[8:32:17] <geassguy360> Zaeed is great. Shallow, but fun and cool
[8:32:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> she has trouble letting go of her partner too
[8:32:21] <RushUnplugged> Kasumi is good and it's criminal that she's limited to DLC
[8:32:21] <jackelzxaa> kasumi is basically just a very funny character
[8:32:22] <+GuilKato> @geassguy360 .... how is that possible she dies cannonically on virmire - because as if youd keep her alive and sacrifice kaidan (I hae kept her alive once!)
[8:32:26] <FennecZephyr> Zaheed wants to kill that guy
[8:32:26] <jackelzxaa> she's like a cartoon character
[8:32:28] <otakon17> I love Zaeed's stories
[8:32:33] <+Tredecian> he did not
[8:32:35] <Samurai_Tchan> @otakon17 and she returns with hair
[8:32:43] <Jaysky> Mordin is the goddamn best
[8:32:45] <ThDark> @otakon17 Story time with Zaeed is one of the best parts of the game lol
[8:32:46] <geassguy360> @GuilKato Maybe your canon
[8:32:47] <+Kindan55> No, he fixed the genophage
[8:32:49] <JetpackMcQuack> but
[8:32:50] <%castlerock42> He fixed it.
[8:32:52] <tanarath> He's also operating a free clinic in a shithole
[8:32:53] <otakon17> LOVE me some Mordin
[8:32:53] <stantheman_97> he didn't invent it he just "improved" it
[8:32:56] <otakon17> Mordin is GREAT
[8:32:57] <aiutare47> Oh yeah pat in ME3 you get to play as a black sun with the Omni bow and everything
[8:32:57] <otakon17> and he's OLD
[8:32:58] <%miguelrod777> not create revised it
[8:32:58] <+GuilKato> Kasumi is getting her dead lovers greybox recording her memories @PatStaresAt
[8:33:02] <%Taisuru> Pe cat
[8:33:04] <otakon17> he's OLD for a Salarian he's 49
[8:33:10] <tanarath> mordin clearly regrets things
[8:33:10] <otakon17> he's like a goddamn Salarian ANCIENT
[8:33:13] <aiutare47> ME3 MP rather
[8:33:15] <otakon17> and he's great
[8:33:15] <TheQuadrupleS> Mordin patched the genophage he did not invent it
[8:33:17] <+AFellowDegen> Mordin is the most interesting character by far. Liara I think has the best writing and most involvement in everything you do
[8:33:20] <%DianaTheAscian> well why wouldn't the player want to hang out with cool aliens
[8:33:22] <otakon17> ME3 MP was great
[8:33:27] <%AbnormalVoid> daaaaaaarrell
[8:33:47] <geassguy360> ME2 has 5 humans and only one of them sucks thats pretty good
[8:33:50] <otakon17> Mordin is probably the best character introduced in ME2 and seeing his reactions during is loyalty mission can be legit heartbreaking
[8:33:55] <otakon17> potentially
[8:34:02] <mrtRoll001> emlo is disappointed
[8:34:10] <%emperordread> Save editor for me
[8:34:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Elmo is silently judging
[8:34:19] <otakon17> yeah the PoNR gives you TWO missions to avoid crew death
[8:34:22] <tanarath> Yeah, reload
[8:34:27] <geassguy360> so many people miss the warnings i dont get it
[8:34:33] <JetpackMcQuack> role play it out DxCat
[8:34:40] <jackelzxaa> mordin genuinely struggles with what he did because he had a really good writer on him
[8:34:41] <otakon17> yeah ALWAYS save the IFF for last
[8:35:00] <%Taisuru> SHE IS THAT BAD
[8:35:02] <+glgzephyr> YUP
[8:35:02] <otakon17> Ashley REALLY isn't that racist but she's very prejudiced against aliens
[8:35:07] <%GarbageNirvana> The IFF is where you get Legion though isn't it
[8:35:13] <%SirGO0SE> shes awful
[8:35:20] <+athuramn> teenagers distracted by dat ass
[8:35:20] <+glgzephyr> @otakon17 What the hell do you think racism is
[8:35:23] <JetpackMcQuack> It's just that I blame turians for my fathers death
[8:35:24] <mrtRoll001> She's so racist
[8:35:29] <jackelzxaa> you should bring ashley to meet anderson at the bar after lockdown because there's an npc that has a specific interaction with her
[8:35:29] <otakon17> ALIENS
[8:35:33] <otakon17> **ALIENS**
[8:35:40] <otakon17> she GETS better
[8:35:42] <$Jedted> She's Really not that bad
[8:35:44] <%wizkid50000> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaBig psaBig
[8:35:45] <%DJFakie> "I can't tell the aliens apart from the animals."
[8:35:46] <+JustToWatch> she's only racist when she's speaking
[8:35:49] <otakon17> I mean shit look at Wrex
[8:35:50] <%Xelhesia> shes even worse cuz she stands out so much compared to other characters
[8:35:51] <Jaysky> You came back!? But you came back as CERBERUS
[8:35:51] <+AFellowDegen> What does Kaiden do in ME2?
[8:35:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Not better enough
[8:35:53] <%DianaTheAscian> wtf
[8:36:04] <FennecZephyr> I literally only killed Ashley because Kaiden was wearing my only set of rank 10 light armor at the time
[8:36:05] <$Jedted> so does Kaidan
[8:36:06] <carni897> hey at least in one aliens killed her family or some shit right?
[8:36:25] <Jaysky> I made a massive mistake in letting Ashley live.
[8:36:25] <carni897> but it two it is literally like no one wanted to actually write the character
[8:36:26] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt didn't my hero also do that?
[8:36:28] <+Tredecian> first playthrough i accidentally slept with her lol
[8:36:31] <vilecrois> were they space dalmatians
[8:36:32] <JetpackMcQuack> that's a big ol 'depends'
[8:36:32] <otakon17> Wrex starts out completely not caring about saving the Krogan, just accepting that they'll eventually die out but because of Shepard and Virmire, he changes and helps lead the Krogan to an actual future in ME2 and ME3.
[8:36:33] <%Taisuru> She doesn't turn a corner if she's dead, which she is
[8:36:33] <Profmcstevie> They attempt a saving throw
[8:36:47] <geassguy360> sorry but people get better, not content to just write people off when they have the capacity to get better. Shame so many people are so eager to write people off
[8:36:47] <%Tarage> Pat Pat it's Pat.
[8:36:49] <%GarbageNirvana> No redeeming qualities of any sort
[8:36:53] <+glgzephyr> She's BORING
[8:36:55] <otakon17> HELL Tali is HORRIBLY racist against Synthetics
[8:37:03] <dukenux> hugevelmo
[8:37:05] <otakon17> there's ALWAYS got to be a boring one
[8:37:07] <Samurai_Tchan> SHE EXISTS to make others loook GOOOD
[8:37:10] <%DJFakie> It's okay to not like someone, turns out
[8:37:11] <otakon17> they're the grounding point
[8:37:12] <Jaysky> @otakon17 And yet she's likable.
[8:37:15] <jackelzxaa> i like ashley's sisters stuff
[8:37:15] <+glgzephyr> her GRANDFATHER would probably be more interesting than her
[8:37:17] <Basch71> Kaiden is inoffensive at best and boring at worst, Ashley is just bad
[8:37:18] <%GarbageNirvana> She could have been literally anyone
[8:37:26] <otakon17> she's likeable because she's adorkable
[8:37:30] <Samurai_Tchan> ELMO IS SO CUTE
[8:37:30] <+Kingtut9009> I fucking hate Tali, but I can understand why people would like her
[8:37:30] <%Taisuru> @otakon17 But she's well written, Ashley ISN'T, at all
[8:37:30] <otakon17> and she's got the bum-bum
[8:37:32] <%wizkid50000> Sounds like Pat
[8:37:33] <+Kingtut9009> Ashley I can't
[8:37:37] <%GarbageNirvana> They could have cycled her position out with a new soldier every mission and no one would notice
[8:37:39] <%DianaTheAscian> Elmo wants to sleep so bad
[8:37:39] <jackelzxaa> kaiden has some actually genuinely funny stuff in mass effect 3, pat
[8:37:44] <jackelzxaa> it might actually be worth taking him to citadel dlc
[8:37:44] <BTR_NOODLE> the only cool story ashley has is about her sister beating a guy
[8:37:44] <%MisterRockett> I'm annoyed whenever Ashely talks even if what she's saying isn't even racist. She's also unnecessarily aggressive and complains all the time.
[8:37:46] <jackelzxaa> like for real
[8:37:54] <jackelzxaa> citadel dlc is very funny with kaiden
[8:37:56] <Jaysky> Yeah Kaiden is funny in 3
[8:37:58] <otakon17> wait didnt they make Kaiden bi in ME3?
[8:38:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Her spot could have just been "Alliance soldier" and you just get a generic placeholder
[8:38:01] <tanarath> @otakon17 Kaidan is but he needs to grow.
[8:38:04] <dukenux> youre default buddies in bioware are milquetoast in general
[8:38:04] <otakon17> did they change it in ME1?
[8:38:10] <%AbnormalVoid> let him put your penis in you
[8:38:16] <jackelzxaa> they just shit on kaiden in the citadel dlc, especially if you dont pick him for any missions
[8:38:17] <+D00msDayDan> i could listen to you talk about mass effect all day
[8:38:21] <dukenux> "You want interesting lore? S
[8:38:26] <otakon17> yeah Ashley is basically Carth 2.0 despite not being voiced by the same guy that Kaiden is
[8:38:26] <%wizkid50000> I am so MAD at Pat rn
[8:38:28] <CheekyBirb> hm
[8:38:32] <tanarath> No, kaidan is straight in 1
[8:38:33] <%wizkid50000> psaSmug
[8:38:33] <%SirGO0SE> psaWink
[8:38:38] <geassguy360> So video games should just not try and have characters that get better because first impressions are everything. Nah don't agree.
[8:38:39] <otakon17> I love this versionof Mass Effect
[8:38:42] <+thecosmicfly> The Gary's
[8:38:44] <dukenux> "You want interesting lore? Suck this guy's lore"
[8:38:44] <%DJFakie> Bezos, Bezos, Bezos
[8:38:45] <%Taisuru> PEEPEE ACKNOWLEDGES US
[8:38:47] <otakon17> The Jeth
[8:38:48] <%GarbageNirvana> I would like to meet a Jeth
[8:38:54] <%SirGO0SE> elmo beautiful
[8:38:57] <otakon17> I wanna pet that cat
[8:39:01] <otakon17> they're so floofy

[8:39:10] <otakon17> God I miss having pets
[8:39:13] <%OldOnyx> just got here, what I miss?
[8:39:15] <tanarath> Ashley is worse. he's irridemably racist & barely a decent soldier.
[8:39:18] <%GarbageNirvana> uuuuuh
[8:39:19] <%DianaTheAscian> salty bet
[8:39:19] <%Xelhesia> simmons is

[8:39:22] <%DJFakie> psaSmug
[8:39:23] <+JustToWatch> Simmons
[8:39:24] <otakon17> Crendor is
[8:39:27] <%Taisuru> LUL
[8:39:28] <+cjm1174> ashley was a complete shithouse
[8:39:33] <NitronStreams> bruh
[8:39:33] <RushUnplugged> @geassguy360 you have to make a character appealing for people to give 2 shits about them. Wrex is a bully asshole and everybody loves him. Ashley is a boring racist and nobody cares about her growth
[8:39:34] <Lamokmok> We already have Joker, that'd enough Jeff in one game.
[8:39:34] <+justianxix> bruh
[8:39:35] <otakon17> EVERYTHING

[8:40:00] <%ramielthe5th> Simmons
[8:40:01] <jackelzxaa> i think ashley is worse as a romance option than as a platonic friend for femshep.  her romance is really bad.
[8:40:02] <Samurai_Tchan> he is so educated
[8:40:04] <otakon17> a quick rundown?!
