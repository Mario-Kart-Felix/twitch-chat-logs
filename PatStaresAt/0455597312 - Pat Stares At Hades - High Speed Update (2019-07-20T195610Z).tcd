[0:11:20] <%tyler274> Cannabis is indigenous to Central Asia[188] and the Indian subcontinent,[189] and its uses for fabric and rope dates back to the Neolithic age in China and Japan.[190][191] It is unclear when cannabis first became known for its psychoactive properties; some research suggests that the ancient Indian drug soma, mentioned in the Vedas, sometimes contained cannabis. This is based on the discovery of a basin containing cannabis in a shrine of the second millennium BC in Turkmenistan.[192]

[0:25:28] <$HentaiSenpai9K> The Red Bull is shrinking him more and more
[0:25:28] <$cureneckbeard> If you have small hands, boobs feel relatively larger.
[0:25:34] <CalderGaming> I don't think that's a hand size thing
[0:25:36] <$renyrells> doesnt the spider man one mean "i love you"
[0:25:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Just need to make the triggers longer
[0:25:36] <%badchoice5> @AngriestPat Pat, I'm gonna be real with you, I don't think you'll ever get to be Spiderman, that moment passed
[0:25:40] <%solzan2000> lazy fingers
[0:25:43] <%Solidnick18> can you do the other hand?
[0:25:44] <%crimsonharvest> you're still spoderman to me
[0:25:44] <%CerberusDriver> Thats a muscle tendon thing
[0:25:46] <%CJett92> Ya I dont think thats a hand size thing tho
[0:25:46] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat It's cool he had a little lever on his hand
[0:25:47] <Adaruan> more like sausagefingerman amirite
[0:25:48] <%Harawanagangsta> Pat, Everyone has that
[0:25:50] <%Agami23> spiderman holds up his pinkie and middle finger @AngriestPat
[0:25:55] <TheBlankAce> That happens with regular hands too
[0:25:56] <%arancet> only blind spiderman
[0:26:01] <%SirGO0SE> but can you do the shocker?!
[0:26:02] <%Solidnick18> oh
[0:26:02] <%FrustratedAF> he could totally be uncle ben, but for a villain
[0:26:06] <%Harawanagangsta> its called connected tendons
[0:26:06] <%FrustratedAF> Litter Bug
[0:26:07] <%Lion_kun> is this game still early access?
[0:26:08] <%crimsonharvest> thats pretty normal, tendons are like that
[0:26:10] <+Punchasaur> This is making me actually sad
[0:26:11] <$joylent_blue> i can't hold my middle finger on my left hand up without also holding up my ring finger
[0:26:11] <@SSaryn> I'M HERE FOR HADES FUNNY MAN also haha small hands
[0:26:16] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat it's not the size of the spider man fingers that matters, its how far you can shoot your web
[0:26:18] <@lewdskeletor13> There’s a universe where Pat is spider man
[0:26:21] <%kiiiirsten> Pat...what the fuck apatWhat
[0:26:25] <%radda343> but if you can do the vulcan salute you're better than everyone that can't
[0:26:28] <@lewdskeletor13> @ssaryn sup binch
[0:26:29] <%badchoice5> Your fingers go as far down your hand as my long, amazing fingers do, so..
[0:26:32] <CalderGaming> yeah but I had to practice
[0:26:37] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 do you remember that time Max looked at zelda r34 live on stream? Pepridge farms remembers... so does cranky I guess.
[0:26:37] <+SodiusChubz> the pinky and middle finger is viewtiful joe
[0:26:38] <immortan_toecutter> Is it arthritis from the video games?
[0:26:38] <$cureneckbeard> Live Long and Pat
[0:26:39] <%SirGO0SE> GIVE SHOCKER
[0:26:42] <%Teintstein> is he about to flip us off
[0:26:42] <%crimsonharvest> pat can you put your palm flat on the table and then lift only your ring finger

[0:26:47] <KahunaTuna> can u do 2 in the pink 1 in the stink?
[0:26:49] <+JavaManJoJo> That pinky middle finger thing sounds like someone is trying to trick you into making a rude gesture
[0:26:50] <dekkitout> Can you throw up the Bloods' gang sign
[0:26:50] <$cureneckbeard> Spiderman can only do it because he has spider DNA.
[0:26:50] <%Solidnick18> i can't i'm so weak
[0:26:53] <%kiiiirsten> Now I feel like a big stoop making hand gestures alone in my office
[0:26:54] <%CJett92> So pat says he doesnt do weed, so what the hell is the explanation for all THIS
[0:26:57] <%wolfofsound> @Kirby_Sauce wait what?
[0:27:00] <gazdropish> Pat just doing gang signs

[0:46:49] <+hkey_local_machine> It's hot degrees outside so all my exhaustation is coming out due to the humility.

[0:48:11] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat give ambrosia for more content before you talk to them
[0:48:22] <immortan_toecutter> Big beef for big updates
[0:48:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> What is the Mc name?
[0:48:42] <%CerberusDriver> i like Cerberus for some reason
[0:48:42] <$joylent_blue> Zagreus
[0:48:43] <spacecatstreams> have you hit the third level before?
[0:49:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Reminder to all that poseidon is a fuck and athena is a shit
[0:49:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> R O M A N C E the gods :3
[0:49:17] <%Remery_> because he's chaos
[0:49:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Athena Victim blames
[0:49:17] <immortan_toecutter> Have sex with deities for reasons
[0:49:24] <%SirGO0SE> aww Chaos-chan needs gift
[0:49:28] <$joylent_blue> just a reminder to everyone, hooded characters are just characters that they haven't implemented the artwork for yet
[0:49:41] <%wolfofsound> can't wait for him to get best boon
[0:49:46] <%CerberusDriver> this goes for anyone that wears a hoodie irl
[0:49:48] <aimlesshealer> Yeahh fuck that skeleton up
[0:49:48] <%SirGO0SE> boyovin
[0:49:58] <$joylent_blue> CerberusDriver yes this is true
[0:49:59] <Tennochief> yay deat
[0:50:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is persephone in the game?
[0:50:02] <princesspinkachu> Here I go dying again
[0:50:03] <0rond> TWIN SHOT
[0:50:06] <0rond> TWIN SHOT SO GOOD
[0:50:10] <%Remery_> More Gods need to have thigh highs even Hades
[0:50:10] <%CerberusDriver> you just need your irl artwork
[0:50:11] <mrlillipad> Rapid Shot is my favorite
[0:50:12] <+Grayhammatter> oooooo
[0:50:16] <%wolfofsound> rapid for me
[0:50:16] <0rond> twin shot is straight up double damage
[0:50:17] <spacecatstreams> triple shot is not great
[0:50:33] <immortan_toecutter> Why is pat red ranger?
[0:50:37] <%CerberusDriver> has Pat ever played a Total War game?
[0:50:43] <%GarbageNirvana> You really gotta stop making me want this game
[0:50:46] <Mattcowdisease6> looks so much like bastion
[0:50:48] <0rond> twin shot gets even better later because it can hit multiple times to kill armored enemies in one shot
[0:50:50] <mrlillipad> Rapid Shot lets you shoot while you sprint, it's so fun
[0:50:55] <@BigNaturalMan59> oh this that game strodent was playing
[0:51:02] <hard_bop_sax_solo> is this randomly generated?
[0:51:03] <%wolfofsound> @CerberusDriver I'd think at least rome, loving three kindgoms
[0:51:11] <%CerberusDriver> 3K is bomb.
[0:51:12] <spacecatstreams> its a bastion rogue
[0:51:14] <%Xooler67> still not touching this till its on steam fuck off epic
[0:51:24] <%CJett92> @hard_bop_sax_solo The rooms are pre-made, but the order is random
[0:51:24] <%FrustratedAF> doubt
[0:51:26] <%FrustratedAF> X

[0:51:28] <%averyoddjew> @Xooler67 same
[0:51:29] <immortan_toecutter> Thanks pat
[0:51:30] <Dr_Mooose> and create some
[0:51:30] <Tennochief> can it solve my sickness?
[0:51:30] <@BigNaturalMan59> playing FFXI would solve many of your problems
[0:51:32] <$joylent_blue> [ X ]
[0:51:32] <+MidnightBurst12> and cause many more
[0:51:33] <@SSaryn> What about my marriage Pat
[0:51:34] <+Grayhammatter> seems... bullshit
[0:51:36] <%badchoice5> Not as many as it causes though
[0:51:36] <immortan_toecutter> Now I am the unemployed
[0:51:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Cause I gotta move by the end of the month
[0:51:37] <%weissguard> @AngriestPat Okay Bethesda.
[0:51:38] <%Dr00_PhD> No joke it actually did help me out
[0:51:39] <%DonatelloJose> can it save me from retail management pat?
[0:51:43] <%ItsRatman> how am i supposed to make money watching your stream D:
[0:51:46] <spacecatstreams> pat, my sister was kidnapped. how can you help me?
[0:51:51] <%Remery_> This stream is great for making sandwiches to
[0:51:53] <hard_bop_sax_solo> watching pat's stream makes me feel taller
[0:51:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Reminder that Hector did nothing wrong and that Achilles deserved it
[0:52:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Really
[0:52:09] <%wolfofsound> Yup
[0:52:16] <Marpolo13> tru
[0:52:18] <%Jaxnos> skeyFLEX big and strong Hades gameplay skeyFLEX
[0:52:27] <%wolfofsound> BOON
[0:52:27] <0rond> best bow upgrade is twin shot, second best is perfect shot
[0:52:31] <%SirGO0SE> ya that hit big hard
[0:52:31] <mrlillipad> Hades
[0:52:32] <+Luthwag> Pat I need so much help, every time I try to log into FF14 I have to change my pass word, then get banned from my own account then spend a whole day waiting for support to unlock my account
[0:52:33] <immortan_toecutter> Achilles was the 1%of the Greek population with magic bullshit.
[0:52:33] <%wolfofsound> Ares
[0:52:33] <%ArcanumMBD> Ares
[0:52:36] <+AllenDeadman> ares
[0:52:36] <0rond> ares
[0:52:38] <spacecatstreams> sera
[0:52:40] <$joylent_blue> ARES CUZ HE'S HOT
[0:52:44] <%CJett92> Bless you
[0:52:48] <%Dr00_PhD> Curse you
[0:52:50] <garrulousAuthority> Health
[0:52:51] <+RowenCleric> AAAARRREEEESSS!!
[0:52:51] <%averyoddjew> NO SNEEZING
[0:52:52] <0rond> ares, just don't get the doom curse boons, they are garbo
[0:52:52] <%CerberusDriver> ARES, DESTROY MY ENEMIES
[0:52:53] <%wolfofsound> well that too
[0:52:53] <garrulousAuthority> What if you take more damage
[0:52:58] <%Wurmspawn> @AngriestPat So I just muted your stream because I found out there's a new Picard Trailer. Are you interested in/hyped for Patrick Stewart's new Star Trek series for next year?
[0:53:01] <mrlillipad> Ares is a fun guy with no issues at all
[0:53:02] <+Punchasaur> I like this aesthetic
[0:53:05] <%boondoggle42> Whenever I'm feeling bad about myself I watch this hateful ginger goblin so I can know that I'm better than somebody
[0:53:07] <immortan_toecutter> Aries do you are kratos
[0:53:14] <%radda343> @Luthwag you probably have a dynamic IP that changes constantly, talk to your ISP about getting a static IP
[0:53:17] <%Remery_> Ares did nothing wrong
[0:53:27] <%CerberusDriver> Ares gets a raw deal though. Born to create conflict; being the God of War kinda sucks.
[0:53:32] <$joylent_blue> do you hate them tho
[0:53:41] <0rond> doom = VoteNay blade rift = VoteYea
[0:53:43] <metrying> this game looks beautiful
[0:53:46] <spacecatstreams> have any of you watched the noclip documentaries on this game? they're really good
[0:53:52] <immortan_toecutter> Daddy ares bless
[0:53:56] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat The idea is to get boons and upgrades. you want to kill fast and not just soak damage
[0:53:58] <Tennochief> Fun fact: In case any of you dont know, Kratos was the personification of strength and one of Zeus's 4 chariot riders
[0:54:02] <%radda343> this looks like the kind of thing I'd love on my Switch
[0:54:06] <$joylent_blue> i want to touch Ares's neck
[0:54:09] <%wolfofsound> His wrath is one of the best
[0:54:13] <simulationbard> I forgot how hot all the gods in this are
[0:54:13] <%foreverN2dust> god, he is hot
[0:54:17] <mrlillipad> Take special so you can put crit on your attack
[0:54:17] <immortan_toecutter> Ares show feet
[0:54:17] <0rond> doom is not that good
[0:54:34] <%ArcanumMBD> Give him an ambrosia!
[0:54:38] <%wolfofsound> ^
[0:54:53] <0rond> @AngriestPat touch the sparkle in the right for lore
[0:54:57] <$joylent_blue> WHOA HES COOL
[0:55:01] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat don't forget to check the room for gold vases they give you gold
[0:55:03] <spacecatstreams> his keepsake is pretty good
[0:55:04] <Dr_Mooose> that's metal
[0:55:08] <%Remery_> Very scary
[0:55:08] <Tennochief> hell yeah
[0:55:08] <$joylent_blue> COSMIC EGG
[0:55:11] <%ArcanumMBD> Hey Pat's in the game
[0:55:12] <%CerberusDriver> Have an egg in this trying time
[0:55:13] <%Svanyr> e g g
[0:55:22] <%averyoddjew> may i offer you an egg in these trying times?
[0:55:24] <0rond> e g g m a n
[0:55:27] <+RowenCleric> .....did he give you a behelit?
[0:55:48] <garrulousAuthority> no, he has it embedded within him
[0:55:52] <Tennochief> Mother Nyx is where it's really at
[0:55:56] <+TheGreatPenor> So what is this game. Like a gungeon style thing or
[0:55:56] <%FrustratedAF> apatHelit
[0:56:07] <%wolfofsound> WAIT
[0:56:08] <$joylent_blue> TheGreatPenor yeh it's a roguelike
[0:56:12] <%CerberusDriver> Thats probably good advice, the greek gods are kinda messed up in the head.
[0:56:13] <%wolfofsound> You missed free gold
[0:56:17] <%Remery_> Well Chaos gave you an egg, don't eat it!
[0:56:17] <+TheGreatPenor> Oh sweet.
[0:56:30] <$joylent_blue> and a social link system
[0:56:33] <%Remery_> And flirting with Gods
[0:56:37] <EcoFreak07> its also very pretty
[0:56:38] <+Thesaltt> Wait...Roguelike?
[0:56:44] <+TheGreatPenor> So these upgrades are only in the dungeon area then you loos it
[0:56:52] <%GarbageNirvana> You get modifiers
[0:56:56] <%Piemen99> Chaos look like a Darkest dungeon boss
[0:56:57] <spacecatstreams> i hope there can be one or two more weapons
[0:56:59] <%wolfofsound> @TheGreatPenor you keep them until the run is over or you die
[0:57:17] <+TheGreatPenor> Ok yes. Cool. And it’s on the spic store right.
[0:57:23] <%SirGO0SE> ost so good
[0:57:24] <%wolfofsound> the game also will give you boons that relate to the ones you've chosen
[0:57:25] <shinichizio> The who?
[0:57:25] <artificiallynatural> there are carry-over upgrades too?
[0:57:28] <+TheGreatPenor> Epic*
[0:57:33] <%GarbageNirvana> For the time being
[0:57:35] <$joylent_blue> TheGreatPenor for now yeah
[0:57:44] <+TheGreatPenor> Ok. Sweet thanks
[0:57:44] <Tennochief> this music is tight
[0:57:46] <Anxietydecending> that charge time makes toy the sittingest of ducks
[0:57:47] <%SirGO0SE> meg is so hot
[0:57:59] <princesspinkachu> Zagreus is just Prince Zuko but god mode
[0:57:59] <spacecatstreams> @artificiallynatural yes, you can get permant ugrades and modifiers
[0:58:00] <%GarbageNirvana> That's the main thing keeping me from buying it right now because idk if I trust that storefront with actual payment info
[0:58:03] <$joylent_blue> DIO(nysus)
[0:58:03] <Tennochief> Dionysus
[0:58:07] <Tennochief> Bacchus is ROman
[0:58:09] <%CerberusDriver> Im just waiting for that DD narrator to suddenly cut in
[0:58:11] <Dr_Mooose> samething
[0:58:12] <%ArcanumMBD> They're the same
[0:58:13] <%Typhaeon> Bacchus is the Roman off-brand ripoff
[0:58:14] <Cobaltor_252> ey boy
[0:58:15] <artoflec> heeeeey BOOOY
[0:58:16] <Tennochief> yes
[0:58:16] <%mh9s> Romaboo
[0:58:18] <%badchoice5> meh same dif
[0:58:19] <%wolfofsound> @GarbageNirvana I used paypal to get it
[0:58:19] <+AllenDeadman> bacchus is the roman version yes
[0:58:22] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@CerberusDriver) (warning)
[0:58:23] <Tennochief> Bacchus is the roman version
[0:58:25] <0rond> these are all ok, dash is kinda weak
[0:58:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Paypal's probably a good idea
[0:58:32] <%CerberusDriver> courage surges as the enemy crumbles
[0:58:34] <mrlillipad> Poison is okay
[0:58:37] <%wolfofsound> deal damage
[0:58:37] <%radda343> but defense tho
[0:58:37] <%FrustratedAF> give poison dash apatGib
[0:58:38] <%Remery_> Aww I bet being the God of Wine is such a sweet deal
[0:58:40] <%ItsRatman> not just a regular dash, a NASTY dash
[0:58:46] <$joylent_blue> man i read the "hey boy"s in chat and i HEARD it in my head
[0:58:46] <+pl0xzz> @AngriestPat Is this still trapped on the Epic Store?
[0:58:47] <%Mattcowdisease6> Mattcowdisease6 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:58:49] <%ArcanumMBD> Dionysus has bad boons imo
[0:58:52] <%ArcanumMBD> i dont like them
[0:58:53] <garrulousAuthority> poison dash fucks up bosses
[0:58:59] <0rond> dionysus cast is great
[0:59:01] <%wolfofsound> @ArcanumMBD it's true he's pretty bad
[0:59:04] <%CerberusDriver> Dionysus is a drunk, of course his boons are meh
[0:59:19] <+ImpHelpSingIt> here on level 9 of robot helllllllll
[0:59:21] <%Remery_> Dionysus starting the parties
[0:59:30] <%ArcanumMBD> Doesn't Dio's cast not put the gem in enemies? So you lose out on a lot of damage
[0:59:44] <%wolfofsound> yup which is why I don't get it
[0:59:48] <0rond> it doesn't, but it stuns them
[0:59:53] <0rond> and it does good damage on hit
[0:59:53] <immortan_toecutter> Does pat is bad?
[0:59:54] <$joylent_blue> pvpS
[0:59:56] <0rond> and dots
[1:00:00] <%wolfofsound> You can put points into extra damage when your cast is in the enemy
[1:00:01] <spacecatstreams> 2manySkulllzz
[1:00:03] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat gonna die
[1:00:09] <%wolfofsound> and can get boons that do damage when they come out
[1:00:15] <%wolfofsound> yes
[1:00:15] <immortan_toecutter> Put points into luck
[1:00:33] <$joylent_blue> put points in luck irl
[1:00:33] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat if it's a mage attack you can
[1:00:37] <+AllenDeadman> 5 HP
[1:00:38] <0rond> btw your wrath drains when clear a room, use it when you have it
[1:00:43] <antary> does anyone know when the next RE2 stream with woolie will be or is woolie still freeflowing on stream schedules
[1:00:50] <spacecatstreams> health upgrades after this room
[1:00:50] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat but you need to dodge the ones that look like shockwaves
[1:00:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Boat dude
[1:01:05] <immortan_toecutter> Get to the back of the boat
[1:01:07] <%FrustratedAF> karen PMSTwin
[1:01:08] <%Mattcowdisease6> Well I subbed but didnt leave a message... cuz im an idiot when it comes to twitch
[1:01:09] <princesspinkachu> War Gods so thirsty
[1:01:09] <0rond> @AngriestPat poms are bad, a new boon is almost always better
[1:01:12] <%CerberusDriver> RE2 is finished, dude.
[1:01:16] <%ItsRatman> @AngriestPat Even though this is early access, would you reccomend it?
[1:01:19] <spacecatstreams> STRANGER
[1:01:21] <%CJett92> Thanks, Karen
[1:01:24] <+mayorrev> @angriestpat which one of the gods was a surfer dude in this game?
[1:01:29] <Dr_Mooose> respect the hustle
[1:01:31] <Anxietydecending> don't golden fleece me, mate
[1:01:37] <%wolfofsound> poms aren't bad depending on what you've got
[1:01:52] <nobknee> Good game?
[1:01:54] <HorribleHog> The dialogue sounds really quiet, or is it just me?
[1:02:02] <immortan_toecutter> Just you
[1:02:02] <%wolfofsound> @nobknee I love it
[1:02:04] <spacecatstreams> if you can upgrade your base damage with a pom its pretty good
[1:02:05] <%GarbageNirvana> It's Supergiant so yeah, good game
[1:02:07] <0rond> poms are usually pretty small increases, if the choice is between a boon and a pom, boon wins almost every time
[1:02:19] <%wolfofsound> It depends on the boon honestly
[1:02:20] <$joylent_blue> mayorrev poseidon
[1:02:33] <%wolfofsound> If you alternate where you put the boon towards it's higher
[1:02:39] <$joylent_blue> i kept wanting to type neptune fuck me
[1:02:43] <immortan_toecutter> B E E F
[1:02:48] <%SirGO0SE> apatBig beef

[1:03:37] <0rond> boon
[1:03:48] <Tennochief> boobs
[1:03:52] <%ArcanumMBD> did they fix the bug with charmed enemies dealing insane damage to you?
[1:03:53] <%wolfofsound> eh her boons aren't very good either
[1:03:54] <0rond> aphrodite cast is also really good
[1:03:56] <%FrustratedAF> that dark thirst for gamer toes
[1:04:04] <dekkitout> Hoes or moneys? Good question
[1:04:04] <mrlillipad> Getting Aphrodite after Dionysus is pretty funny
[1:04:08] <artificiallynatural> man these rooms get hectic
[1:04:19] <immortan_toecutter> Drink aphrodites bath water
[1:04:27] <%Remery_> Aphrodite's bath water quiettAww quiettAww
[1:04:29] <%wolfofsound> LUL

[1:04:40] <$joylent_blue> need more crowd control pvpS
[1:04:43] <Tennochief> no
[1:04:48] <%ArcanumMBD> Gotta use the traps and pillars to your advantage
[1:04:51] <%CJett92> Try stepping on the pads, so the turret will hit the enemies
[1:04:59] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:05:32] <%CerberusDriver> Aphrodite would totally sell bath water except it would have good effects
[1:05:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Just in time.
[1:05:38] <Tennochief> LUL
[1:05:40] <%ArcanumMBD> Aphrodite put some clothes on. It's cold down here in Hades

[1:05:57] <%badchoice5> LUL
[1:05:59] <%wolfofsound> see all trash
[1:06:02] <0rond> aphro cast is pretty good
[1:06:02] <Ropcord> gamer god bathwater Kreygasm
[1:06:03] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:06:03] <Dr_Mooose> honestly, I'd buy
[1:06:04] <%FrustratedAF> pat patron saint of energy drinks
[1:06:06] <mrlillipad> Cast might be good, or dash
[1:06:06] <spacecatstreams> 2 hits for the dash?
[1:06:07] <%Dr00_PhD> Wave of despair sounds like bathwater
[1:06:08] <+pl0xzz> doodLewd doodLewd doodLewd doodLewd doodLewd
[1:06:10] <%ArcanumMBD> Shatter is a good shotgun. Dash is amazing
[1:06:11] <+Javaa01> I heard it costs an arm and a leg
[1:06:17] <spacecatstreams> i like her cast
[1:06:17] <+mczarklesby> She was a war god in some places, would probably rock a RTS game.
[1:06:21] <%wolfofsound> Dash is the only decent one
[1:06:28] <Silverbee> Look brothers! Tits!
[1:06:29] <0rond> cast is good, dash is ok
[1:06:33] <%ArcanumMBD> dash through enemies, they become weak
[1:06:34] <immortan_toecutter> Door dash
[1:06:38] <$joylent_blue> Faaaabulous~
[1:06:38] <%radda343> you're a magical girl now
[1:06:42] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat you can always replace it if you get offered another dash
[1:06:48] <0rond> dash means you can't take artemis dash tho
[1:06:52] <princesspinkachu> Not all boons are made equal
[1:07:03] <%SirGO0SE> spent it all on gamer god bathwater
[1:07:05] <$joylent_blue> the name Passion Dash is funny LUL
[1:07:11] <%wolfofsound> he's dead
[1:07:14] <%SirGO0SE> glorious hot meg
[1:07:14] <%FrustratedAF> lets goooooo
[1:07:18] <+ProtoT1> god i love meg
[1:07:19] <%Dr00_PhD> I do
[1:07:22] <Tennochief> yes
[1:07:27] <Aji__> its so damn hot outside pat
[1:07:29] <Aji__> help
[1:07:30] <0rond> you know what's better than a dash that makes enemies weak? not getting hit lmao
[1:07:34] <+God_damnit_why> He babe I’m home
[1:07:39] <%wolfofsound> will he even get her to the second stage?
[1:08:10] <%ArcanumMBD> they're inside Meg
[1:08:11] <%wolfofsound> @0rond I tried telling him get damage not reductions, but she really had nothing. This at least does damage
[1:08:14] <%Remery_> she's going to tenderirze you
[1:08:22] <BunnyEmperor> Oh wow early Pat
[1:08:22] <%CerberusDriver> shut up Meg, fricking sweet Lois
[1:08:23] <@StridentSong> Your cast lodged in Meg for 30 seconds
[1:08:29] <0rond> nah aphro cast is good
[1:08:31] <immortan_toecutter> Meg predicts his loss
[1:08:35] <immortan_toecutter> Believe it
[1:08:39] <%Remery_> Aphro tries her best
[1:08:42] <0rond> not the best, but good
[1:08:52] <InugamiTheHound> is this game still in early beta or is it our for real?
[1:08:58] <BunnyEmperor> @AngriestPat Pat did you check out the new Eden raid yet
[1:09:00] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean he hasn't been taking a LOT of hits
[1:09:00] <$joylent_blue> PogChamp
[1:09:02] <%wolfofsound> better to dash around her constantly with 33dmg eash dash
[1:09:05] <immortan_toecutter> Spin to win
[1:09:17] <%ArcanumMBD> gotta control those adds
[1:09:25] <%wolfofsound> dash also helps with adds
[1:09:40] <+Punchasaur> Megara Kreygasm
[1:09:45] <immortan_toecutter> Install add block
[1:10:10] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat you can shoot her casts btw
[1:10:11] <+MellowMute> Nice

[1:10:22] <%Xooler67> not really
[1:10:35] <%gespenst25> Lol this is Megaera the Fury not Megara the wife of Heracles.
[1:10:38] <spacecatstreams> her voice actress in the movie god-tier
[1:10:40] <0rond> I love how your win screen against a boss is your death screen but for the enemy

[1:11:10] <Tennochief> @gespreminds me of Kronos and Chronos
[1:11:12] <%ArcanumMBD> lol game is like "heal up you idiot"
[1:11:12] <+Punchasaur> Probably the hottest Disney waifu
[1:11:15] <0rond> death defiance is so goo
[1:11:17] <garrulousAuthority> get the death defiance
[1:11:38] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat you should get any defiance you see since you're still new at this game
[1:11:55] <deviljhojho94> !UPTIME
[1:11:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 11m.
[1:12:00] <mrlillipad> Hermes has some fun boons
[1:12:01] <deviljhojho94> Thank you moobot, very cool
[1:12:10] <garrulousAuthority> Hermes gives you that S A N I C speed
[1:12:14] <0rond> hermes boons are cool, they are different from the other gods and are all passives
[1:12:18] <captainthunderwolf> See, this is what happens when you let the kid from Bastion move to Greece.
[1:12:25] <immortan_toecutter> Get hermes from bathwater
[1:12:34] <captainthunderwolf> He just starts killing dead old people because he ran out of fart people to murder for profit.
[1:12:37] <%wolfofsound> I got lucky and got a bunch of blade dash upgrades with his +3 dashes so I was zipping all over the place
[1:12:54] <0rond> best ermes boon is +30% evade
[1:13:04] <%ArcanumMBD> you can lure those stone guys to fall onto the lava, its great
[1:13:09] <%ArcanumMBD> also works wonders on the boss version
[1:13:16] <deviljhojho94> What a jackass
[1:13:17] <Miss_Ebola> Hearing Pat talk about this game on the podcast made me buy it. Finally managed to reach the end after trying for so long. Also shield is best weapon, fight me.
[1:13:18] <0rond> evasion is good
[1:13:19] <%wolfofsound> I think dodge
[1:13:20] <Tennochief> thanks Hermes
[1:13:27] <immortan_toecutter> Very cool
[1:13:28] <captainthunderwolf> Hermes is always a weird hyperactive asshole, it's great.
[1:13:28] <Unicyclemonkey> Evasion seems good
[1:13:29] <deviljhojho94> Rapid cast looks real neato
[1:13:31] <garrulousAuthority> @Miss_Ebola shield IS the best weapon
[1:13:33] <%CerberusDriver> Hermes' death in GoW3 was pretty satisfying
[1:13:34] <0rond> cast is good but you don't have a good cast yet
[1:13:34] <+MellowMute> 60% slow is crazy
[1:13:35] <deviljhojho94> evasion too
[1:13:39] <spacecatstreams> his best boons are attack/special speed up, movement speed up, and extra dashes
[1:13:41] <Dave__> Hermes Is a nerd
[1:13:51] <garrulousAuthority> get Athena's boons and Royalguard everything
[1:13:52] <%ItsRatman> thats not how math works but ok
[1:13:55] <%deathbytincan> deathbytincan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Woop Woop
[1:13:58] <@StridentSong> Always take the free troves
[1:14:03] <%wolfofsound> he didn't give boon to get the trinket
[1:14:06] <%ArcanumMBD> 15% of the time the dodge works every time
[1:14:20] <immortan_toecutter> When in doubt add cheese
[1:14:30] <princesspinkachu> Now with squid
[1:14:34] <circular7> StinkyCheese
[1:14:41] <circular7> Squid3
[1:14:44] <%wolfofsound> That's double boon
[1:14:45] <%FrustratedAF> ed PogChamp
[1:14:48] <0rond> that's 2 boons
[1:14:48] <spacecatstreams> double boonies
[1:14:49] <garrulousAuthority> oh no
[1:14:50] <%ArcanumMBD> big fight boon
[1:14:53] <deviljhojho94> hmmmm interesting
[1:14:56] <immortan_toecutter> Ed
[1:14:58] <spacecatstreams> wine or war?
[1:15:00] <%CJett92> Choose thot
[1:15:01] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat probably dio his poison adds would be annoying
[1:15:02] <0rond> @AngriestPat you get both
[1:15:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Get crunk
[1:15:07] <Tennochief> WAR
[1:15:09] <spacecatstreams> pick fuckboy
[1:15:15] <Miss_Ebola> So how far's Pat get? He make it to asphodel yet?
[1:15:19] <0rond> don't fall for the doom memes
[1:15:24] <0rond> curse of agony is not good
[1:15:31] <mrlillipad> Wrath pulls in foes seems funny
[1:15:32] <%wolfofsound> urge to kill
[1:15:33] <immortan_toecutter> Begin thot
[1:15:38] <%ArcanumMBD> you attack slow enough that doom is worth it
[1:15:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Hard to argue against raw dmg up
[1:15:43] <%badchoice5> STRENGTH GO UP
[1:15:45] <%ArcanumMBD> it'll pop before the next hit i think
[1:15:50] <circular7> the damage number go up?
[1:15:52] <garrulousAuthority> no you ain't
[1:15:52] <+Punchasaur> Number go up
[1:15:55] <Tennochief> what
[1:15:56] <%wolfofsound> get ready for poison
[1:16:01] <princesspinkachu> Hey guys did you hear Curse of Agony and Engulfing Vortex are gonna be at Warped Tour this year
[1:16:02] <%Remery_> He's not happy
[1:16:06] <%wolfofsound> this is why I said go for ares LUL
[1:16:11] <%ArcanumMBD> welcome to BLIGHT CON
[1:16:11] <immortan_toecutter> Enemy go up
[1:16:19] <0rond> ares' enemy buff is way worse
[1:16:31] <Tennochief> Ares is definitely worse
[1:16:41] <Tennochief> never piss off a war god
[1:16:42] <%Piemen99> So why is he trying to get out of the underworld?
[1:16:44] <%wolfofsound> really? I find his to be more managable
[1:16:51] <Miss_Ebola> He wants to see mommy.
[1:16:52] <%wolfofsound> @Piemen99 to see his mom
[1:16:56] <%Piemen99> ah
[1:16:59] <0rond> dionysus enemy buff with the bow is EZ
[1:17:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> Don't wanna go down to blight town
[1:17:05] <@BigNaturalMan59> thebetCas
[1:17:13] <Miss_Ebola> She said she was going to get cigarettes and never returned.
[1:17:35] <immortan_toecutter> These flu season enemy’s suck
[1:17:58] <+Punchasaur> Which Greek mythology person is the main character supposed to be again?
[1:18:10] <Dave__> Jesus
[1:18:16] <spacecatstreams> zagreus, son of hades+persephone
[1:18:18] <+Punchasaur> Good
[1:18:21] <%badchoice5> Not badf
[1:18:25] <0rond> this cast is fine
[1:18:31] <%SirGO0SE> lmao tipsy shot
[1:18:34] <%ArcanumMBD> wow spacecat with those spoilers Kappa
[1:18:37] <0rond> tipsy shot is underrated
[1:18:38] <immortan_toecutter> Zagat god of restaurants
[1:18:45] <spacecatstreams> pat is past it
[1:18:46] <%SirGO0SE> fart gas
[1:19:07] <immortan_toecutter> Boondox
[1:19:16] <%SirGO0SE> strong gas
[1:19:20] <0rond> you wanna stand in the fart gas so enemies come to you
[1:19:33] <+Punchasaur> I can see Kratos being a guest in this
[1:19:35] <%ArcanumMBD> I mean like, it's ancient mythology that Hades and Persephone have a thing
[1:19:37] <Miss_Ebola> The bow is making me feel anxious. I've lost so many runs cause I was foolish enough to try it again.
[1:19:39] <deviljhojho94> aww hell yeah brother
[1:19:41] <%ArcanumMBD> hard to spoil something that old
[1:19:48] <0rond> can't zagreus just wait until winter comes?
[1:19:51] <Tennochief> remember, Kratos is NOT a war god
[1:19:54] <%SirGO0SE> gas op
[1:20:21] <+Punchasaur> He’s a very minor god in the mythology
[1:20:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> L A V A
[1:20:34] <Tennochief> personification of strength
[1:20:45] <Tennochief> one of the chariot riders for Zeus
[1:20:48] <0rond> BIGG BLADE RIFT
[1:20:50] <immortan_toecutter> Thanks ares veres cool
[1:20:53] <%Typhaeon> BIG rift

[1:20:59] <%SirGO0SE> BLACKU METAL
[1:21:02] <%ItsRatman> ares REALLY wants you to spin to win
[1:21:05] <0rond> 2 or 3
[1:21:13] <+MellowMute> D O O M
[1:21:14] <immortan_toecutter> Brack metal
[1:21:20] <princesspinkachu> So Zagreus just has daddy issues or am I not following

[1:21:25] <0rond> BOON
[1:21:26] <%wolfofsound> BOOM
[1:21:27] <%some_sunflowers> Boon
[1:21:28] <%ItsRatman> boon
[1:21:29] <@StridentSong> BOON
[1:21:30] <%some_sunflowers> Always boon.
[1:21:31] <deviljhojho94> BOOM BABY
[1:21:33] <spacecatstreams> you can get boon in shop
[1:21:34] <+bubbli97> boon
[1:21:34] <0rond> THIS IS EXTRA GOOD BOON
[1:21:35] <deviljhojho94> I MEAN BOON
[1:21:35] <+RowenCleric> allways boooon
[1:21:35] <%CJett92> badabing badaBOON
[1:21:36] <Miss_Ebola> Nah man, Hades is kind of an ass.
[1:21:37] <%Bane_Kaikyo> L A V A
[1:21:40] <%Skittlesoul> shop
[1:21:41] <+Punchasaur> Boonguy
[1:21:42] <%some_sunflowers> It also might not. This is guaranteed a boon.
[1:21:45] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat save money you'll get a shop before the final boss of the floor
[1:21:50] <0rond> skull boon = harder room, better boon
[1:21:52] <%radda343> you don't know what's in the box, it could even be a boat!
[1:22:03] <immortan_toecutter> Folk interlude
[1:22:06] <Miss_Ebola> Also Pat is using the bow and he wasn't sure to go with bow girl.
[1:22:28] <spacecatstreams> artemis is my waifu
[1:22:31] <%wolfofsound> @Miss_Ebola I always go to her no matter what cus bae
[1:22:51] <0rond> best bow special is athena, best bow attack is artemis
[1:22:57] <princesspinkachu> Pat this is so easy, clearly you just hit the guy with the pointy stick
[1:23:02] <0rond> poseidon is very close second bow special
[1:23:06] <Tennochief> if they put in Chronos, will his boon be time stop?
[1:23:10] <+MellowMute> This kite flies itself PogChamp
[1:23:14] <%wolfofsound> @0rond you talking about reflect special?
[1:23:17] <0rond> yeah
[1:23:22] <%wolfofsound> agreed
[1:23:25] <immortan_toecutter> Helicopter for damage
[1:23:26] <startstoprepeat> i haven't played in awhile, but i'm pretty sure there's a duo for weak + doom too if you get lucky
[1:23:32] <%wolfofsound> especially for the third plane
[1:23:35] <deviljhojho94> Athena was a real bitch but she was nice compared to other gods
[1:23:37] <%gespenst25> That seems unlikely.
[1:23:38] <Tennochief> Athena's cool, but also a hypocrite at times
[1:23:39] <+Estuko> spin2win
[1:23:42] <deviljhojho94> Poor arachne
[1:23:47] <Tennochief> especially with Arachne
[1:23:54] <Tennochief> and sometimes Scylla
[1:24:06] <Tennochief> and Medusa
[1:24:07] <0rond> YO
[1:24:10] <deviljhojho94> Actually scratch that, she was not nice at all
[1:24:10] <0rond> THAT DASH IS SO GOOD
[1:24:11] <%wolfofsound> DASH
[1:24:12] <spacecatstreams> i can never remember roman names outside of the planets
[1:24:15] <immortan_toecutter> H E R B Y
[1:24:16] <0rond> TAKE DA DASH
[1:24:17] <startstoprepeat> dash is terrible, do not
[1:24:20] <%wolfofsound> toldya you could replace
[1:24:20] <TranquilTurnip> well shit
[1:24:20] <%CJett92> wew
[1:24:20] <princesspinkachu> Pressure points sounds fun
[1:24:23] <spacecatstreams> you cant dash attack with bow!!
[1:24:24] <princesspinkachu> Seems like a good time
[1:24:33] <Tennochief> Artemis roman is Diana
[1:24:35] <mrlillipad> You replace your pink sparklies
[1:24:36] <+MellowMute> 140% damn PogChamp
[1:24:39] <Miss_Ebola> Welp.
[1:24:39] <spacecatstreams> you have to tap attack after dash
[1:24:47] <0rond> you can dash>attack>dash>attack and you basically do +140% damage always
[1:24:58] <%CJett92> rip
[1:24:59] <Miss_Ebola> Think he'll make it past the Hydra?
[1:25:02] <%wolfofsound> you always want to be moving in the same not standing still firing
