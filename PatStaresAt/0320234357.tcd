[0:02:43] <TheBlankAce> Yo Pat before you forget you put on the worst weapon and shield in the game when you have better equipment on you, unless you got really attached to the pot lid and stick.
[0:02:43] <kwangalang> why aren't you watching HUNTER, HUNTER
[0:02:46] <+jaggiesama> slam her pregunant until she cries
[0:02:50] <$i_am_therydon> slam her pregnant has got to be one of the most vile and hilarious things ive ever heard
[0:02:53] <Halok1122> First one should be up on YouTube if anyone missed it, it was pretty good "spam her pregnant until she cries"
[0:03:03] <Josef_Stryker> I've been playing Yakuza 0 lately and it is amazing how much side content they jammed into this game
[0:03:03] <+jerree66> @kwangalang It sucks ;P
[0:03:06] <$NocturneNovember> cheer200 Hey, Pat, jsut wanna thank you and Woolie for finally getting me MOTIVATED to play through Devil May Cry. Beat the first one last night and just got through Agni and Rudra today. They're the actual best.
[0:03:08] <%Remery_> Put it on a T-shirt
[0:03:14] <+jerree66> @kwangalang jk
[0:03:19] <Josef_Stryker> Like I spent 2 days doing nothing but sidequests and improving my real estate
[0:03:20] <%ToxInjection> that part honestly had me in stitches after a rough work week. I really needed that.
[0:03:22] <Dunric_Mordamir> I can't wait to seem Pat (not) slam people pregnant until they cry
[0:03:26] <Halok1122> The question is, is Pat wearing underwear
[0:03:28] <%Derc127> @Josef_Stryker Welcome to every Yakuza game
[0:03:34] <rob_pat> angni rudra boys in!

[0:03:50] <%deviljhojho94> yakuza 0 is still phenomenal and is only 20 bucks right now
[0:03:50] <%Remery_> When will Pat make his HxH review video?
[0:03:57] <kaindoog> will pat cast another water spell without realizing it? i sure hope so

[0:31:42] <%2Metronomes> The fuck even were those words?
[0:31:46] <+Mikatonic> @grayjammer but it's not just shock value tho. Goblins are evil, so they do evil things
[0:31:46] <Superbro64> read the anime reddits REACTION to goblin slayer
[0:31:47] <Worldbrand> i dunno it's not gratuitous so much as to establish a reason why you should hate goblins
[0:31:50] <ekkieekk> Berserk literally did the same exact thing as goblin slayer but worse
[0:31:50] <%SuperCasualBoom> 24 hour tag batsu was great
[0:31:53] <%craig_t> the most important thing about doomguy was that he refused to kill civilians and had a cute pet bunny, and that doom is just meaningless gore that can't shock anyone

[0:45:23] <%TheSniperJoe> cheer200 Goblin Slayer is quite good but it skips out on some of the backstory on the initial party and that seems to have rubbed people the wrong way. On top of that it has a REALLY misleading thumbnail that makes it look like a happy go lucky, moe, isekei of the month show...so some people ran into BIG surprises.

[1:00:40] <%Keyd00d> you were pepped before pat
[1:00:40] <%AncelDeLambert> because physical defense? Nerd.
[1:00:41] <Calek> does this game even have elemental weaknesses, I feel like it doesn't

[1:01:12] <+cvp5127> those ppl are weak
[1:01:15] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> fuck those people there is nothing wrong with turned based combat
[1:01:15] <%laserbeaming> There was that game "Dragon Quest Monsters Joker" for the Nintendo DS that was like pokemon
[1:01:23] <Worldbrand> I do not envy people who didn't grow up with turn-based RPGs because oh boy would that be hard to get into after the alternatives
[1:01:24] <$TheNeedlesD> because it's still a fantasy Paige @AngriestPat
[1:01:24] <+TastySammiches> That's dragon quest tho. FF always changes, DQ stays the same
[1:01:26] <%AbnormalVoid> it's very simplistic, which is fine for a while, but it kinda gets boring
[1:01:27] <Fellmouse> some people just hate turned based combat
[1:01:27] <%Keyd00d> they don't need to change
[1:01:27] <Plague_bagel> thats why everyone like persona 4 right? LUL
[1:01:28] <ArcanumMBD> change frightens the japanese
[1:01:30] <%crimsonharvest> They've just constantly refined it to a very mature polish
[1:01:32] <californaya> I haven't touched a DQ since 8, and it sure looks like exactly the same but better looking.

[1:01:42] <+ChaosVulpes> I love me some DragonQuest, only one I never played was 10
[1:01:46] <Morsuzado> an rpg is oudated? fuck off.
[1:01:46] <fairore> @plague_bagel right lol
[1:01:49] <%Keyd00d> damn that sucks
[1:01:54] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean where Final Fantasy keeps trying to reinvent the wheel, Dragon Quest knows you don't fix what ain't broke
[1:01:55] <+cvp5127> come out to close to spiderman
[1:01:56] <blockedL> dang
[1:01:57] <Coystick> @CandidCocoa nailed it, nostalgic comfort food
[1:01:57] <%Remery_> Steam is very picky
[1:01:58] <+JayEarly> I like turn-based but SMT got more spiced
[1:01:59] <TheBlankAce> It is literally illegal to release a dragon quest game not on a holiday in Japan
[1:01:59] <+FeVaRi024> But Dragon Quest changes are a lot more than Pokemon changes per series entry
[1:02:00] <+Jimboq> good maybe it will be on sale soon
[1:02:00] <%xxviios> thats unfortunate
[1:02:03] <ArcanumMBD> I'd have picked it up if it didn't come out at the same time as AC: Odyssey, and didn't cost $80 CAD
[1:02:04] <pectusumbra> It is the basis for the origins of the monstergirl encycopedia and the like
[1:02:04] <BackstageOyster> hopefullyit does well on Switch
[1:02:04] <%rdark_ksu> wait this is on Steam?
[1:02:09] <Calek> SMT is very spicy
[1:02:10] <+solzan2000> yep

[1:12:32] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 3 years ago was at a local rollerskate rink get together I was on my roller skates and right when I was about to go onto the safe off zone a couple skating behind me decide to kiss and not pay attention and veered onto my side that I manage to drive my knee and head into each other really fast and be knock out for two minutes. Happen again last year playing a dance pad game at an arcade and an idiot’s kid ran into my pad and trying to avoid stepping on him, fell back, knee head again.

[1:13:17] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat The existence of Dragon Quest is why Hunter X Hunter will never end. Togashi keeps replaying these damn games instead of working on his manga. You can also see the DQ's influence on some designs like Kurapika.

[1:14:42] <+ChaosVulpes> Pat refuses to equip his sword, instead uses literally weakest weapon in game.
[1:14:42] <+Karebuncle> Glasses were invented in the 1300's
[1:14:44] <%Superstarsage> that was some DELICIOUS PUMPKIN PIE you ruined it

[1:14:53] <Plague_bagel> someone designed that
[1:14:53] <element_of_loyalty> YOINK
[1:14:54] <TerraWraith> @Keyd00d YEAH!
[1:14:56] <Coystick> Anything to prevent Clipping
[1:14:57] <+cvp5127> bank for cowards
[1:14:58] <%crimsonharvest> You lose half your cash on hand if you die. This is the only death penalty.
[1:14:59] <+resstarr> You lose half your money when you die Pat
[1:14:59] <%Keyd00d> REMEMBER LAST TIME YOU USED A BANK
[1:15:00] <%PipIV> Family will starve
[1:15:00] <Coystick> CLIPPING is a sin
[1:15:01] <+Grayhammatter> you lose money if you die
[1:15:02] <TheyCallMeVawn> Bank? *Hollow Knight flashbacks*
[1:15:03] <raindog23> you lose it if you die
[1:15:03] <%clausover> @AngriestPat You lose half on death
[1:15:03] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you lose money if you die
[1:15:04] <+jerree66> LOSE MONEY IF YOU DIE?
[1:15:04] <+Devilbringer133> Remember if you die in DQ you lose half your cash
[1:15:05] <+Zaver88> You lose half your money when you die
[1:15:06] <+Helghast102> you lose half of your gold if you die
[1:15:07] <xeros720> when you die in dragon quest, you lose half your gold and go back to save point, you keep all xp
[1:15:07] <element_of_loyalty> MAJIN BUU
[1:15:07] <katocrimson> interest rates?
[1:15:07] <%Quietshun13> you lose money when you die
[1:15:07] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat favorite band is Smashing Pumpkins *old man slaps knee*
[1:15:08] <TheBlankAce> You lose half your money on death
[1:15:09] <Rhinoprotoss> LOSE YOUR SOULS
[1:15:10] <+Zaver88> WHICH YOU SHOULD NEVER DIE
[1:15:10] <dizilicious> Jesus Christ invented Glasses in Year 1
[1:15:12] <Donchalant402> there is no reason to use banks since you always have an autosave when you enter a new area
[1:15:14] <%rdark_ksu> withdraw all the money
[1:15:16] <Fellmouse> Banks are the future!
[1:15:17] <CandidCocoa> @AngriestPat the way dying works is that you keep your xp and respawn at a save point for half your money in exchange
[1:15:19] <+joylent_blue> just don't die 4Head
[1:15:20] <%Keyd00d> The game is super easy you shouldn't die
[1:15:24] <%AbnormalVoid> you lose half your money when you die, but you can just reset the game and reload lol
[1:15:25] <LiquidMathew> just like real life
[1:15:27] <Rhinoprotoss> It's always been like this
[1:15:27] <%laserbeaming> Is there a corpse run in this game?
[1:15:29] <+TastySammiches> be glad it's not realistic and you don't lose it all
[1:15:29] <laguerrilha> Put all you money on the bank Kappa Nothing bad will happen
[1:15:30] <%crimsonharvest> So the reason you don't sell armor is because you need that cash in a non-liquid form.
[1:15:31] <+ChaosVulpes> If die you did something wrong
[1:15:37] <xeros720> dq11 has autosave, so you can ignore it if you want
[1:15:38] <%Kghaleon> It's like souls, who cares if you lose money this early.
[1:15:39] <beefcakemanthrob> you can also just reload
[1:15:40] <pectusumbra> Hey, monsters gotta make money too
[1:15:40] <%Gogogolem> The monster have to get the gold from somewhere
[1:15:45] <SiegeJay> Wait You keep your Exp?

[1:15:59] <Deadbulky> Pots Pat
[1:15:59] <Donchalant402> there is literally no reason to EVER use the bank now that there is autosave, its just there for the sake of legacy
[1:16:01] <%Gogogolem> beat him and take his money
[1:16:02] <+ChaosVulpes> He ignored those POTS
[1:16:02] <CandidCocoa> the game also has autosaves, technically
[1:16:03] <+ahdurian> POTS
[1:16:05] <BackstageOyster> However there is a trick tho, you could load an auto, then go to main menu, then load your manual save bypassing the penalty
[1:16:06] <count_bob> Pots.
[1:16:08] <zal_silverfang> POT MISSED

[1:20:05] <$awsomesaucekirby> swordswordswordsword
[1:20:05] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat shes a kid duh fuck ya expect her to give you, a FUCKING SWORD??
[1:20:05] <Fellmouse> @SulfurousAcid I see what you did there
[1:20:09] <Djinnazz> It's fuckin great!
[1:20:10] <%laserbeaming> Jakuzies of the North Star
[1:20:12] <xeros720> it's like you're not even a jrpg protagonist
[1:20:12] <%aishman> @AngriestPat Jim Sterling was right when he called it "The best Yakuzis."
[1:20:16] <element_of_loyalty> JUMP <3
[1:20:22] <+ChaosVulpes> Is he purposely ignoring the sword in his bag???
[1:20:24] <ekkieekk> make sure to check dressers and wells @AngriestPat
[1:20:25] <%PipIV> kick of the South star
[1:20:33] <xeros720> i've been playing that one and Y0 is still better, it's still really fun
[1:20:33] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> He knows about the sword, but he doesn't want to use THAT sword
[1:20:35] <element_of_loyalty> NIce hat dick
[1:20:37] <SulfurousAcid> he thinks that sword is a cheating sword
[1:20:39] <+joylent_blue> this protag gives zero fucks about gravity
[1:20:39] <%Gogogolem> I wish the main character of this game had a better design.
[1:20:40] <%xxviios> it cant be the best because theres no Majima
[1:20:42] <+Zaver88> Platform Pat
[1:20:42] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat in previous dragon quest games if you tried to use chimera wings or zoom indoors you'd hit your head on the ceiling since you get to your location via flying. This is the only game that lets you teleport indoors.
[1:20:45] <%deviljhojho94> look at this fat fuck
[1:20:46] <+Zaver88> You can
[1:20:49] <%janoonoo> Fist of the Yakuzis is great. Just play it in Japanese so Kiryu is Ken
[1:20:50] <%Ilpala271> wretched hive of scum and villainy
[1:20:51] <+Grayhammatter> hit of the west star
[1:20:53] <%Ilpala271> it's the shit
[1:20:55] <+ChaosVulpes> He won't be getting a better sword until he literally forges one himself
[1:20:59] <harpoonspear> stick > sword
[1:20:59] <+Grayhammatter> first try
[1:21:03] <%deviljhojho94> BOOK GETTO
[1:21:04] <tarkus_awesome> @angriestpat combat is fun but not as in-depth as yakuzis and it holds your hand a bit longer than yakuzis
[1:21:05] <element_of_loyalty> PEACH GET BACK HERE
[1:21:05] <%xxviios> wait this game lets you teleport indoors wtf
[1:21:06] <%laserbeaming> Be careful, that guard had a Vaykor Sydon, he can blind you if you hit him while he guards
[1:21:07] <$TheNeedlesD> Reward yourself with smashing more pots

[1:26:51] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat The existence of Dragon Quest is why Hunter X Hunter will never end. Togashi keeps replaying these damn games instead of working on his manga. You can also see the DQ's influence on some designs like Kurapika.
[1:26:52] <%Toynota10> apatDab apatDab

[1:27:06] <%PipIV> again?
[1:27:08] <+dominiccassiere> Pat, do you still have that framed picture of Steve Buscemi and all the other crazy random gifts from the mailbag?
[1:27:09] <thepardack> And so the lord commanded, "Dab in my name. You will be blessed with the power to preganante."
[1:27:10] <+LogothX> I can't believe Paige is fucking dead

[1:27:21] <+cvp5127> pregnantgan
[1:27:28] <TerraWraith> Bergil and Pregante
[1:27:28] <Genis94> But yo, seriously Pat, the Goblin Slayer backlash is seriously overblown. Yes, it's gritty and dark, but it mostly happens at the start of the series. It lightens up after that.
[1:27:29] <%PipIV> weak sauce
[1:27:38] <element_of_loyalty> @AngriestPat who has a tiger jacket?
[1:27:40] <BigNerdSam> Everyone pregnant? Even the men??????
[1:27:40] <%deviljhojho94> hmmmmm
[1:27:41] <digitalbooklet> i cant believe the first stream I catch is you dabbing for the lord
[1:27:41] <+jerree66> ouch
[1:27:41] <sparrrow_> is it true that Pat pregnante?
[1:27:43] <NopeBadguy> COUPLES ARE A MENACE CONFIRMED
[1:27:45] <xBiggestD> Shit, stream is ending??
[1:27:53] <%PipIV> ouch
[1:27:58] <+dominiccassiere> Pat, do you still have that framed picture of Steve Buscemi and all the other crazy random gifts from the mailbag?
[1:27:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What the hell is the October announcement y'all have been hyping up? @AngriestPat Tell us about the straw too
[1:28:00] <+Grayhammatter> couples are a M E N A C E
[1:28:03] <eco419> lol
[1:28:03] <+joylent_blue> you gotta talk after a pee
[1:28:04] <%DedlokPM> @xBiggestD he just came back from a break
[1:28:05] <%Kghaleon> sue tf out of them
[1:28:09] <TerraWraith> Stop kneeing yourself in the face is my advice
[1:28:22] <%janoonoo> Did you do a Thanksgiving?
[1:28:24] <%deviljhojho94> No plans means confirmed
[1:28:29] <+Grayhammatter> infinity!
[1:28:30] <TheBlankAce> Pat please at least acknowledge that you have a weapon better in your inventory than the stick
[1:28:35] <%PipIV> double confirmed
[1:28:35] <silvcrest> I can't believe Pat is fucking BLIND!
[1:28:36] <Worldbrand> fire emblem would be a HARD sell next to FFT
[1:28:36] <Zansatsu0379> Well if somebody is gonna kick your ass, it may as well be yourself.
[1:28:36] <%AbnormalVoid> another TRPG not as good as FFT apatDab
[1:28:42] <eco419> yeeeeee
[1:28:44] <katocrimson> Monster in the afternoon, Red bull at night. Kinda concerned for you Pat...
[1:28:44] <+Zaver88> The nightmare that is Pat not continuing the story.
[1:28:47] <%deviljhojho94> I WANT A PLUSH OF THAT
[1:28:50] <%deviljhojho94> ITS SO CUTE
[1:28:52] <zal_silverfang> @TheBlankAce he did he just doesnt want to use a cheat weapon
[1:28:55] <thepardack> The only cool thing about Goblin Slayer is the dude's armor. That's some hot armor.
[1:29:02] <CandidCocoa> btw you were saying it earlier but you can only set the difficulty stuff at the start of a new playthrough
[1:29:02] <eco419> awwwww
[1:29:02] <%DedlokPM> @TheBlankAce Pretty sure he used it until he got the stick then swapped it out because DLC sword
[1:29:03] <+FeVaRi024> I like it's little death scream
[1:29:04] <Foreluney> !uptime
[1:29:04] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 29m 6s.
[1:29:04] <+Grayhammatter> poor platypunk
[1:29:04] <%crimsonharvest> I got a toy slime collection up here on my shelf
[1:29:04] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige killed the controller
[1:29:08] <%Remery_> That what she said :)
[1:29:11] <%craig_t> god, i know i'm being the most obnoxious gatekeeper, but every time i here "i fell in love with fe because of awekeneing" i want to scream
[1:29:15] <Calek> what I like about Goblin Slayer is that it's just a DnD campaign
[1:29:19] <%Keyd00d> This is how Pokemon should look like by now
[1:29:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Zaver88 So like Nier Automata bad or God of PS4 bad?
[1:29:22] <%PipIV> that abomination got what it deserved
[1:29:25] <Coystick> Goddamn Toriyama sameface monsters
[1:29:27] <%deviljhojho94> I like the lizard on gobbo slayer
[1:29:27] <TheBlankAce> @zal_silverfang It's not dlc its the starting equipment the stick is a shitter weapon he picked up
[1:29:29] <sparrrow_> you can change the battle camera if you want
[1:29:29] <Donchalant402> you mean pokeyman makes you think of dragon quest
[1:29:31] <%Meme_Platinum> poke quest
[1:29:33] <%Toynota10> Love that sound
[1:29:34] <%craig_t> lit's a shame you got into the series on a downward trend
[1:29:38] <+Zaver88> Pokemon get's some of it's inspiration from Dragon Quest V
[1:29:49] <%crimsonharvest> Yeah pat got a non-dlc sword earlier and put it away for a weaker weapon
[1:29:58] <zal_silverfang> @TheBlankAce remember. pat is always wrong. im just stating what he said earlier
[1:29:59] <%deviljhojho94> yeah trunks is a good design
[1:30:00] <sparrrow_> he's just trunks
[1:30:00] <%MrBorisMakarov> It reminds me of Android 17
[1:30:01] <fairore> @craig_t dam
[1:30:01] <eco419> goblin slayer is meh
[1:30:01] <+Grayhammatter> he's SUPER generic
[1:30:02] <Coystick> Android 18?
[1:30:03] <VHLW> uniquely generic
[1:30:04] <CandidCocoa> MC is a good boi
[1:30:05] <Coystick> 17?
[1:30:06] <+jkobe34> trunks and 17
[1:30:06] <laguerrilha> Yeah i like Trunks
[1:30:07] <Fellmouse> that makes no sense
[1:30:08] <SulfurousAcid> trunks android 17
[1:30:09] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat he's trunks
[1:30:10] <%Keyd00d> He looks fine
[1:30:11] <Donchalant402> I wouldnt say he is generic, his purple coat is pretty unique
[1:30:11] <yukichocomilk> he's RPG man
[1:30:12] <+blastazoid26> He's just Trunks
[1:30:12] <$eldrich_horror> so is he like grinding already?
[1:30:12] <Morsuzado> trunks
[1:30:13] <ape_hawk> pat, have you seen any of the new fallout 76 gameplay that came out today?
[1:30:14] <Sol_Install> he's trunks and 17 combine
[1:30:14] <troxcree> What's not to like about C17?
[1:30:16] <%WheatlyXT> Trunks is always a good look
[1:30:17] <%laserbeaming> He looks like fantasy rpg Trunks
[1:30:17] <sparrrow_> shit he's more 17
[1:30:17] <+LogothX> Android Trunks 17
[1:30:18] <+FeVaRi024> He could be named 'GUY' and I'd be like yea
[1:30:19] <%PipIV> smack their shit, boi
[1:30:20] <%WheatlyXT> SO TRUNKS
[1:30:20] <thepardack> The MC design isn't trying too hard to be unique but not going into light novel protag looks.
[1:30:22] <+oleron_666> hes a brown trunk
[1:30:24] <MrBotchamania> He looks like trunks
[1:30:24] <digitalbooklet> Trunks Hair 2018
[1:30:25] <+chetasaur> trunks and 17 love child
[1:30:26] <dekkitout> you dont say SeriousSloth
[1:30:26] <+ChaosVulpes> He's just Trunks
[1:30:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> OTP
[1:30:28] <Fellmouse> he's so generic that he's not generic?
[1:30:32] <redwilt> So you're saying it
[1:30:32] <Zombrocom> He's just trunks
[1:30:34] <Warbot40> He's more 17 than Trunks
[1:30:34] <Coystick> He looks like one of the civves Nappa vaporized when they landed
[1:30:34] <%Agami23> he looks like a dragon ball heroes create a character
[1:30:35] <%deviljhojho94> fuck
[1:30:35] <CandidCocoa> theres like recolor mods so far
[1:30:37] <+Arbal3st> it's meh...he gets one of the coolest costumes in all of DQ much much later in the game
[1:30:40] <CandidCocoa> nothing much beyond that
[1:30:41] <+Zaver88> @Sphincter_Spelunker How about he spent 2 hours on the first stream and only got to where most people are by the first half an hour.
[1:30:42] <thepardack> YOU NEED TO BE STOPPED
[1:30:43] <+blastazoid26> @AngriestPat There are costumes tho
[1:30:44] <%ssjklyco> He's a filler arc
[1:30:45] <+Zerodyne90> isn't everything about DQ generic?
[1:30:45] <Fujiwara_92> He's android seven-trunks
[1:30:45] <%Fenrirlives> He has a solid design, not a very powerful silhouette but a well tied together outfit overall
[1:30:53] <redwilt> MC is Trunks 17 or Android Trunks
[1:30:56] <mercado94> i dont think it will be hard to change textures to make the mc look like 17
[1:30:58] <%deviljhojho94> THAT IS CUT ETOO
[1:31:00] <CandidCocoa> and yeah his later costumes look pretty cool
[1:31:00] <%SuperCasualBoom> Let it go Pat
[1:31:02] <%crimsonharvest> I like the MC's alternate outfits too
[1:31:04] <xeros720> when they start running away, you're a higher level than them, PAT
[1:31:04] <%deviljhojho94> Why is everything so cute HERE
[1:31:07] <%Keyd00d> Pat's already strong enough to make everyone run away
[1:31:09] <Coystick> ANDROID DABTEEN
[1:31:10] <digitalbooklet> laterSlime
[1:31:11] <SiegeJay> @AngriestPat The Main Character is a BIG DORK. You learn this when you set the Shypox Difficulty
[1:31:11] <%bluetocho13> 17 is much hotter then this guy
[1:31:12] <Warbot40> Problem is when I think Trunks, I think of the Bowl Cut
[1:31:14] <$eldrich_horror> you dont even need to grind in this game till post game
[1:31:15] <Fellmouse> If you give him red hair, the little hammer dude looks a lot like Pat
[1:31:15] <katocrimson> I wanna to see the Bulma-looking hotties in the game
[1:31:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Zaver88 Oh. Had no clue. That explains the lack of waifus
[1:31:17] <%craig_t> @fairore i freely admit to being kind of elitist, but awakening was alright at best and fates was capital b Bad, and if they didn't have waifu appeal they'd have no fanbase at all
[1:31:18] <%Caidezes> Town has more stuff in it.
[1:31:22] <+Grayhammatter> no chug
[1:31:22] <%Agami23> its the water in the town
[1:31:22] <+Helghast102> it's not odd at all, the towns are FULL of objects
[1:31:26] <+Arbal3st> But my Baeteen...
[1:31:26] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat it's that town specifically that chugs
[1:31:29] <%HiroTSK5> Overworld doesn't have as many NPCs
[1:31:30] <%commanderclaw> What kind of chugging?
[1:31:31] <eco419> kawaii desu~~
[1:31:32] <ekkieekk> @Zerodyne90 its only generic because it's so old that a lot of other things are based off it
[1:31:33] <CandidCocoa> that town big chugged on my PS4 in like one spot
[1:31:35] <Worldbrand> probably poor occlusion culling
[1:31:38] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> I can't wait till pat meets sylvando the best character
[1:31:44] <DraxTD> yeah you beat that wierd platituss' ass @AngriestPat !
[1:31:44] <%crimsonharvest> Like how Blighttown specifically chugs
[1:31:52] <%PipIV> snuff those cuties for the grind
[1:31:53] <+Zerodyne90> makes sense
[1:31:59] <Warbot40> There's a spot in puerto valor that consistently chugs.
[1:32:02] <Sol_Install> for now
[1:32:08] <+Zaver88> Heliodor is pretty big compared to the other towns in the game.
[1:32:10] <ekkieekk> @AngriestPat dressers and wells are very important for loot and gold
[1:32:13] <digitalbooklet> Did pat just start this tonight? hot damn laterSlime
[1:32:14] <Coystick> What's occullsion culling?
[1:32:15] <+joylent_blue> until you get that one sword that clips horrendously
[1:32:16] <%crimsonharvest> Consistent is the whole DQ aesthetic
[1:32:16] <CandidCocoa> the artstyle works really well in this engine, too
[1:32:20] <+LogothX> I wish graphic settings included chiaroscuro shading
[1:32:22] <xeros720> agreed, this game is very polished in ways i don't expect games to be anymore
[1:32:22] <%badchoice5> It helps that it's apparently made of solid metal or something, cause it barely moves
[1:32:28] <sparrrow_> also read book
[1:32:29] <%ssjklyco> Woolie would probably orgasm over no clipping
[1:32:29] <grayjammer> No clipping makes Pat's Penis The Big Penis
[1:32:30] <TerraWraith> Yes, rob the people
[1:32:31] <fairore> @craig_t im condoning your behavior at fe man
[1:32:35] <$Kefbar> have you ever played one of the tales of series ?
[1:32:37] <%Keyd00d> huzzah!
[1:32:37] <+Grayhammatter> big trunks
[1:32:41] <%ThatRandomGuy661> You HAD a sword
[1:32:42] <thepardack> @Coystick Basically it makes it so if you can't see it, the game decides not to load it in, which eases up on the processing demand.
[1:32:47] <Worldbrand> @Coystick super simplifying, but basically you don't render anything that is considered to be obscured by another object
[1:32:49] <+Zaver88> It's weird. Toriyama's art style works well enough in 3D.
[1:32:49] <+ahdurian> you alkready had a sword though
[1:32:58] <lemon_lore> maybe u can change his hair colour
[1:32:58] <SulfurousAcid> let's kill the king that's what we're doing right?
[1:32:58] <Fellmouse> wonder how long it will be before TeamFourStar does a DragonQuest Abridged that pisses off Toriyama
[1:32:59] <outis94> no smash pots first
[1:32:59] <+FrostMass22> Hopefully you can cosplay him at his best: in GT
[1:33:01] <%deviljhojho94> Secret Pat
[1:33:02] <digitalbooklet> @angriestpat the ultimate goal of the game is to BECOME TRUNKS laterSlime
[1:33:02] <Coystick> Oh like the trees in Witcher 3

[1:48:22] <pectusumbra> No, this is 100% The king is a monster in disguise, it happens in every damn dragon quest
[1:48:23] <%ssjklyco> Wait, so they are gonna kill the thing that defeats the dark one?
[1:48:23] <+resstarr> Its like they want to nip this in the bud but they've got the wrong plant
[1:48:25] <%radda343> you sholdn't have trusted dr gero
[1:48:25] <%laserbeaming> The way clemps described it seemed less dumb. Wow
[1:48:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Aw, rip all those preggos in your hometown
[1:48:26] <+Comrade_Vladof> They just needed the Dr. Gero clone to be evil, ok?

[1:48:36] <%Everpresent_Overseer> A proper hero's reward?
[1:48:39] <%Sp3ctre48> Dr Gero is too smart for your tricks Pat
[1:48:39] <Warbot40> Ya that King is totally in on it.
[1:48:39] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Luminary dies, darkness dies? how is that logic solid?

[1:57:25] <%PipIV> lack of peripheral vision
[1:57:28] <%Meme_Platinum> this is why guards shouldn't wear helmets
[1:57:30] <wsintai> @AngriestPat They arent too tought to kill either
[1:57:31] <element_of_loyalty> KISS
[1:57:32] <%Remery_> Blind Knights -.-

[2:14:37] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat You'll want to grab dual wielding and victimizer for Erik ASAP
[2:14:37] <TheyCallMeVawn> You have to unlock dual wielding
[2:14:38] <%crimsonharvest> Boomerang for the love of god

[2:14:41] <+resstarr> he can use sword, daggers, and boomerangs
[2:14:42] <%Keyd00d> not until you get dual wield
[2:14:46] <%crimsonharvest> Boomerang is AOE
[2:14:46] <element_of_loyalty> Ninjago
[2:14:46] <Donchalant402> HITS EVERYTHING
[2:14:48] <%Keyd00d> boomerang hits all enemies

[2:14:49] <KishinGrek> Ear the Dual wield skill
[2:14:49] <+Grayhammatter> he can, you just need to get him skills
[2:14:49] <+rei0> boomerang is AOE
[2:14:50] <%Basch71> aoe
[2:14:50] <Sol_Install> Hits everything
[2:14:51] <HeianKyodai> boomerang is AoE
[2:14:52] <+ahdurian> boomering aoe
[2:14:52] <Cranky_Construct> It's good for grinding
[2:14:53] <TheyCallMeVawn> Boomerang hits EVERYTHING
[2:14:53] <+resstarr> Boomerangs hit multiple enemies but the damage falls off as it hits more
[2:14:55] <%aishman> Boomerang hits the group of people
[2:14:55] <Fujiwara_92> Aoe
[2:14:57] <+Wiseblood_79> Boomerang can hit groups of enemies
[2:14:59] <%Agami23> imma be honest. i would pay a decent amount of money to get magus into this game as a super boss.
[2:15:00] <%claudesavegely> boomerang is aoe
[2:15:00] <element_of_loyalty> My Boomerage won;t come nback
[2:15:00] <pectusumbra> I believe boomerangs are AoE
[2:15:01] <%crimsonharvest> the GREATSWORD is also aoe
[2:15:01] <beefcakemanthrob> since you're sword and board, stick to knives
[2:15:02] <diiizle> Rangs are trash af in this game. I assume they're good on normal at least
[2:15:03] <Warbot40> Erik doesn't get great till late game.
[2:15:05] <%Big_Dream> Boomerangs are op pat
[2:15:06] <%AncelDeLambert> boomerang BEST WEAPON in EVERY DQ game, Pat
[2:15:08] <%aishman> Also later on you can get Dual Wielding in the character tree
[2:15:08] <Skeletonmanners> boomerang hits everyone

[2:15:12] <%aishman> OR
[2:15:14] <%aishman> double boomerang
[2:15:14] <Fellmouse> Greatsword also AOE
[2:15:17] <Rhinoprotoss> What a clever disguise
[2:15:18] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat check his character builder he should have a skillpoint or two
[2:15:19] <KahtaLzargo> Totally less suspicious.We two iconspicuous fellows. Yup

[2:15:20] <Big_King_Coconut> Using a boomerang as a weapon CoolStoryBob
[2:15:21] <TerraWraith> Go to tactics and make him obey orders
[2:15:26] <Cranky_Construct> @AngriestPat Boomerang skill branch has early abilities that are effective against metal enemies. Makes it easy to farm metal slimes in the next major region.

[2:51:55] <Zombrocom> I don't believe a word this guy says
[2:52:06] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat the lil ghost dudes play way less importance in this version of the game. Apparently in the 3DS version they let you go on a sidequest that lets you fight the final boss of each game in the style of their game.
[2:52:06] <%badchoice5> "Ok ok, I'm sorry for doubting you, now get back down there and back to work.
[2:52:07] <OwlLightningMage> He ate the orb
[2:52:07] <Overloard> (B) LIE
[2:52:10] <element_of_loyalty> so bloated
[2:52:11] <42nfl19> For now?

[2:52:14] <$SGrim> DERK THE GOD rooKek
[2:52:17] <+ChaosVulpes> Derk IS an okay guy.
[2:52:17] <%crimsonharvest> Don't forget that in DQ, god is real and she's on your side.
[2:52:17] <%AncelDeLambert> the fat is where one hides the LIES
[2:52:18] <%Remery_> Gain it's Orby powers
[2:52:19] <Rhinoprotoss> Bettter kill Derk just in case
[2:52:20] <dekkitout> you mean the red orb hes wearing as a broach

[2:52:57] <Zombrocom> Itsatrap
[2:53:06] <%AncelDeLambert> don't anyone EVER give me shit again about turning on Japanese dubbing on any game that allows it
[2:53:06] <%SuperCasualBoom> Be fat though, he is evil

[2:53:29] <element_of_loyalty> So much for the BI life
[2:53:29] <BlitzChocula> wow Erik is super quick to forgive, it seems.
[2:53:30] <%Remery_> DID HE STEAL HER TOO?
[2:53:31] <+resstarr> if clerk was playable he'd be a merchant
[2:53:32] <Donchalant402> his wife hits on erik if you talk to her
[2:53:34] <+resstarr> derk
[2:53:38] <sparrrow_> I don't trust him
[2:53:40] <%AncelDeLambert> goes home, his girlfriend is crucified

[2:53:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 53m 43s.
[2:53:45] <%Kghaleon> He didn't do anything.
[2:53:46] <PROUD2beGINGER> I'm not eating babies Derk
[2:53:48] <Fellmouse> Remember, Derk is only one letter away from Derp

[2:54:18] <Donchalant402> @FeVaRi024 I mean wouldnt you? Just look at that spikey hair
[2:54:19] <%Agami23> derk seems like the kinda guy who would let his kids drink, but only if it was in the house
[2:54:21] <Hidashi13> SKIRT
[2:54:22] <%Archphronimos> just kill the guards with the power of stabbing
[2:54:26] <+Grayhammatter> time to get mangles
[2:54:28] <Fellmouse> @AncelDeLambert good point
[2:54:30] <tarkus_awesome> hmmmm.....
[2:54:33] <+ChaosVulpes> If Patches has hair, it means he's not evil anymore
[2:54:38] <eco419> sleepy
[2:54:42] <Fujiwara_92> dager
[2:54:52] <%Everpresent_Overseer> lead the guards to manglegrove, let the forest take care of the problem!
[2:54:53] <%SuperCasualBoom> Derek is basically Cheng Zinsan from Fatal Fury.
[2:54:54] <+Grayhammatter> better boomerang
[2:54:58] <DracaenaLeaf> goodnight
[2:54:59] <%Kirijuo> I'm fucking dumbfounded that that scene went so well
[2:55:06] <%AncelDeLambert> why can't the thief burgal a new weapon?
[2:55:07] <$TheNeedlesD> Pop a redbull Pat
[2:55:10] <+FeVaRi024> Sync yawned
[2:55:11] <element_of_loyalty> me too
[2:55:12] <$TheNeedlesD> use it as a striker
[2:55:14] <sparrrow_> shoot up more Red Bull Pat directly into the veins of you cock
[2:55:16] <%Keyd00d> the dragon quest is too comfy
[2:55:20] <Hidashi13> any blue dragon references yet?
[2:55:20] <+casualelite> i guess that's what happened to him after dark souls 3
[2:55:23] <%AncelDeLambert> You're a burgler, go in there and BURGAL something!
[2:55:24] <%badchoice5> That's on you Pat
[2:55:24] <%claudesavegely> you fool
[2:55:27] <+ChaosVulpes> Pat will soon gain the ability to make his own weapons soon... well in the Manglegrove anyway
[2:55:28] <Kratok> Dang, I didn't think you'd still stream this, how much did I miss

[2:55:37] <42nfl19> Pat you hate coffee right?
[2:55:39] <BlitzChocula> have you tried cocaine? saves a lot of fridge space.
[2:55:39] <+FeVaRi024> Comfty?
[2:55:40] <%DedlokPM> Maybe if someone didn't drink a Red Bull at 1 AM last night he would have been more rested today. teenJOY
[2:55:41] <icantstopthescreams> Fall asleep on stream so your balls can be exposed
[2:55:42] <%badchoice5> Pat, don't you secrete Red Bull by now?

[2:55:57] <%Keyd00d> At least make it back to hometown
[2:55:58] <eco419> cummies
[2:56:02] <+McSnazzyPants> cumfies
[2:56:02] <%ssjklyco> Shitstreams
[2:56:03] <%Remery_> No Redbull No Stream
[2:56:03] <42nfl19> I like cold iced coffee cause I can chug it all down fast
[2:56:06] <%crimsonharvest> but the next plot point is at a campsite so dont worry
[2:56:07] <%Kirijuo> Who drinks coffee this late at night
[2:56:10] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat: The Red Bull Pokémon...gotta drink them all!!
[2:56:19] <eco419> oh yeah cumfie stream
[2:56:21] <%PipIV> @kirijuo heroes
[2:56:23] <Donchalant402> manglegrove is pretty short
[2:56:26] <%Keyd00d> MANGLEgrove sounds pleasant
[2:56:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hey coffee drinkers. Does coffee make y'all poo?
[2:56:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Let's go to Nibelheim
[2:56:35] <%PipIV> only villains drink red bull at 1am
[2:56:39] <Worldbrand> yeah this is comfy
[2:56:41] <lokiluko> usually switch to tea after 6pm
[2:56:43] <+SparkAfterDark> indeed it does
[2:56:47] <Overloard> is this a zelda? Kappa
[2:56:50] <Hidashi13> man brolys cool
[2:56:52] <OwlLightningMage> Manglegrope has all the hentai monsters
[2:56:53] <%camodikk> i keep asking ,bu ti finally subbed and am trying to get onto the discord, after i link my twitch to discord, i just have to wait an hour for it to show right?
[2:56:56] <%Remery_> Comfy Ball Stream
[2:57:00] <icantstopthescreams> @Sphincter_Spelunker Not really but if i drink more then 1 or 2 cups i get stomach sick
[2:57:02] <zal_silverfang> @Sphincter_Spelunker i find myself pissing more often
[2:57:12] <kappamutton> I saw these characters and thought these are toriyama creations arent they, and yes they are
[2:57:13] <KatabolicRage> the price of using a boomerang really
[2:57:17] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat If you put your party members on AI, they will use monster weakness moves when apropriate, thus teaching you.
[2:57:17] <%Archphronimos> @camodikk it takes a while apparently
[2:57:19] <%PipIV> A devastating blow!
[2:57:19] <+Grayhammatter> SeemsGood
[2:57:20] <%Keyd00d> it's weaker so you can hit more enemies
[2:57:20] <dekkitout> SeemsGood
[2:57:25] <+Sasorei> sasoreSSS
[2:57:30] <+Sasorei> yay! Dragon Quest XI :D
[2:57:33] <+ChaosVulpes> Boomerangs, nice in that they hit ALL enemies in the encounter... but do less damage with each enemy hit. Until you get the BEST boomerang which doesn't lose power on each hit
[2:57:33] <Fujiwara_92> SeemsGood
[2:57:34] <eco419> yey
[2:57:35] <%camodikk> gotcha, ty, just wanted to make sure im doing it right, thanks
[2:57:38] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat look at what erik's victimizer skill does
[2:57:38] <SovPho> Wait I know why this music sounds so familiar!
[2:57:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Noted
[2:57:49] <SovPho> It's just the Scooby-Doo run away music GOD DAMN IT
[2:57:55] <Hidashi13> piccolos?
[2:57:56] <%PipIV> A singular strike!
[2:57:59] <sparrrow_> DICKS
[2:58:02] <+GN93> why is trunks killing mushrooms
[2:58:04] <%crimsonharvest> To get the most out of Boomerang damage, buff the fuck out of the weapon and the character
[2:58:07] <+ChaosVulpes> Yeah, AoE is nice to have
[2:58:08] <dekkitout> PogChamp mushroom boi
[2:58:10] <+resstarr> You can actually switch weapons without wasting a turn
[2:58:10] <Donchalant402> very phallic
[2:58:11] <SovPho> THIS SONG IS JUST SCOOBY DOO
[2:58:12] <KatabolicRage> weapon choice is kindof a big deal, I set up my erik to dagger it up and made him into a single target DESTROYER persnally
[2:58:14] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> erik did 16 damage since he hit two guys for 8 while the hero only did 11
[2:58:15] <+Grayhammatter> a funGHOUL
[2:58:18] <eco419> lol it is hannah barbera like
[2:58:25] <%Everpresent_Overseer> oh no the shroom works out
[2:58:33] <%PipIV> Continue the onslaught! Destroy. Them. All.
[2:58:36] <sparrrow_> that's what I imagine Pat's dick looks like
[2:58:44] <%badchoice5> You know, stupid as this looks, Trunks and Gohan killing mushrooms and pilafs does seem like a real DBZ episode
[2:58:45] <%Remery_> Boomerang class should replace Archer Classes in RPGs
[2:58:46] <%crimsonharvest> I let my Erik go full boomerangs and he jsut sweeps dungeons for me now
[2:58:47] <Donchalant402> @KatabolicRage divide+poison+victimizer=EVERYTHING DIES
[2:58:54] <dekkitout> looks kinda like toad...
[2:58:56] <KatabolicRage> yep
[2:59:00] <%Everpresent_Overseer> crabs
[2:59:04] <+Grayhammatter> nope, stump chumps
[2:59:04] <+resstarr> cat :(
[2:59:05] <element_of_loyalty> KITTY
[2:59:06] <%Remery_> kitty
[2:59:10] <Hidashi13> ENEMYS RUN OUT OF MP!
[2:59:15] <OwlLightningMage> That kitty is adorable
[2:59:15] <+ChaosVulpes> If you spec into daggers and get duel wield for Erik, you can then make him duel wield boomerangs if you wish. :3
[2:59:16] <%craig_t> it doesn
[2:59:17] <Hidashi13> what?
[2:59:18] <+resstarr> panootsHamsad
[2:59:20] <BeefyQueefer> Wood Slab Crab
[2:59:22] <Zeemod155> Beep Beep D:
[2:59:23] <Coystick> Crab Tree is a better name
[2:59:23] <Fellmouse> not the kitty!
[2:59:24] <icantstopthescreams> That should be Pats new Nickname "Stump Chump"
[2:59:24] <+Sinister_Aglet> that tree ate itself
[2:59:25] <KatabolicRage> I can see boomerangs becoming good in their own way if you get dual wielding with them though
[2:59:26] <%PipIV> Monstrous size has no intrinsic merit, unless inordinate exsanguination be considered a virtue.
[2:59:28] <%craig_t> it looks nothing like a crab

[3:00:28] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat the basic math for dragon quest damage is Power minus one half of Defense

[3:01:29] <Graywolf_the_45th> bless child
[3:01:33] <%SaltyDongs> excitement
[3:01:37] <+Prinny_Raider> if you wanted to play with one hand the L2 button can be used as the x button
[3:01:39] <+Sasorei> :D good! that means you still have more to do, i wish I still did haha
[3:01:42] <%PipIV> god bless you
[3:01:58] <xeros720> sort of drove me nuts since the AI would always know when the monsters were weak to a status effect or certain ailment
[3:01:58] <%DedlokPM> @Prinny_Raider teenOOH

[3:02:20] <+ChaosVulpes> Wait till you start unlocking COSTUME ARMOR!!!!
[3:02:22] <dekkitout> everyones cooler in a longcoat
[3:02:23] <%Keyd00d> Just like that cloak that Pyra gets
[3:02:24] <%badchoice5> It doesn't add stealth tho
[3:02:26] <+FeVaRi024> You can find it on a treasure chest
[3:02:27] <%crimsonharvest> If you watch closely during closeup you can see that character clothing animates separately from their bodies
[3:02:35] <+FeVaRi024> In CObblestone I think
[3:02:38] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:02:39] <+ChaosVulpes> I wore the Drassilian armor on the main character for so long...
[3:02:39] <%Remery_> Thicc Mushroom

[3:03:20] <%SaltyDongs> f
[3:03:20] <%DedlokPM> @FeVaRi024 he was wearing the DQ8 look for most of the prologue. he switched back at the end of it
[3:03:20] <Fellmouse> Pat, how could you
[3:03:21] <juhbathehutt> KILL IT
[3:03:21] <TheyCallMeVawn> MILLIONS OF SABRECUBS DEAD
[3:03:21] <KatabolicRage> you get one of those kitties as a party member in DQ5

[3:03:32] <+tigerfang86> 410 BILLION DEAD SABERCUBS
[3:03:32] <alwayspronking> *murders a kitten WHO ELSE WANTS SOME
[3:03:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sabercats were my favorite in DQ Monsters coxLuv
[3:03:39] <+tegas_> @GN93 incorrect.
[3:03:39] <Donchalant402> STRENGTH GO UP
[3:03:39] <+Sasorei> Yus! Percy!
[3:03:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SEED OF STR
[3:03:47] <%AncelDeLambert> @GN93 no shut up though
[3:03:51] <%Agami23> the boomerand is a blunt and hard weapon. so it likely crushed the cats skulls
[3:03:51] <%Everpresent_Overseer> so cute for murder
[3:03:52] <+resstarr> STRSEED
[3:03:54] <%CurrySauseBandit> Skin those babies Pat!
[3:03:56] <Fellmouse> why must the adorable always die
[3:03:57] <Huntercd> Why are they so adorable?!
[3:03:58] <+Bad1uck> kitties!
[3:03:58] <+ChaosVulpes> EAT THE SEEDS!!! Pump that strength and then duel wield some falcon blades. :3
[3:04:00] <SchroedingersFerret> Give the seed to Crono
[3:04:03] <Donchalant402> USE ALL SEEDS ON MC
[3:04:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ALL TO THE MC
[3:04:05] <sosuke5> SeemsGood
[3:04:05] <%PipIV> Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[3:04:09] <%Keyd00d> ALL ON MC
[3:04:09] <eco419> TWT
[3:04:11] <BigNerdSam> GIVE IT TO CRONO
[3:04:11] <+Grayhammatter> DO IT
[3:04:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ALL SEED TO MC
[3:04:13] <Fujiwara_92> USE EVERYING ON THE MC
[3:04:13] <+ChaosVulpes> Yes, main character go up!
[3:04:13] <+resstarr> SeemsGood
[3:04:13] <+tegas_> Solid plan.
[3:04:14] <TheyCallMeVawn> I always use it on the MC
[3:04:14] <KatabolicRage> seed use on protags is a good way to do things yes
[3:04:15] <%AncelDeLambert> all are unworthy before THE MAIN CHARACTER
[3:04:15] <+rei0> yes
[3:04:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> thots
[3:04:16] <%Keyd00d> EVERYTHING TO CRONO
[3:04:18] <zal_silverfang> always use all seeds on MC
[3:04:18] <+SparkAfterDark> Give it to Robo you fuck
[3:04:19] <Fellmouse> always pump the MC
[3:04:19] <LiquidMathew> All into the MC
[3:04:20] <+tigerfang86> BUFF THE MC YEAH DO IT
[3:04:20] <%crimsonharvest> Seeds to MC, but seeds of skill on whoever when you're short one or two points
[3:04:20] <+tegas_> Not a big deal one way or another.
[3:04:21] <+ChaosVulpes> Force feed the MC those seeds
[3:04:21] <element_of_loyalty> what are feelings
[3:04:22] <+Grayhammatter> main character go big up
[3:04:23] <+Sasorei> Everything to the MC is the rpg rule Pat!
[3:04:24] <bambowl> makes sense
[3:04:26] <mercado94> give it to chrono
[3:04:27] <hntronium> I usually use it on the MC first
[3:04:28] <Fujiwara_92> EVERYTHING ON CRONO
[3:04:29] <+Helghast102> Erik makes the best use of them if you wanna go full tryhard, which i know you do
[3:04:31] <dekkitout> pretty boy needs to be maximum!
[3:04:36] <Hidashi13> are the puff puff messages still in the game?
[3:04:40] <xeros720> yup, you can do it that way; i totally forgot to use them so i'm calling them all "bonus" anyways
[3:04:42] <+resstarr> +2
[3:04:45] <42nfl19> Is there a limit to the number of monsters in an area? Or can you kill them indefinitely?
[3:04:45] <%AncelDeLambert> give everything to the FUCKER YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM
[3:04:45] <KatabolicRage> you better believe it
[3:04:46] <cipadat> @AngriestPat Thanks for streaming something at this ungodly hour when I just wake up from being a horrible person
[3:04:47] <Donchalant402> you also got a seed of agility
[3:04:47] <eco419> just dont get Chrono
[3:04:49] <+Karebuncle> Maybe save magic seeds for the inevatable magician character
[3:04:51] <%SaltyDongs> so strong
[3:04:54] <+Grayhammatter> yes, puff puff is still in
[3:04:55] <+Karebuncle> but also everything on mc

[3:05:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> You have other seeds too pat.
[3:05:08] <%PipIV> Slowly, gently, this is how a life is taken...
[3:05:09] <%AncelDeLambert> NOOOOOO, not the cute one!
[3:05:10] <%Remery_> It barely knows how to fight :(
[3:05:10] <%Everpresent_Overseer> they jsut want to live in peace D:
[3:05:15] <killerking> @angriestpat You have the option to swap your main character out during battle but yeah hes always around
[3:05:17] <+ChaosVulpes> Nothing more fun than duel wielding some falcon blades and getting four crits from a basic attack :3
[3:05:18] <xeros720> the MC's magic skills are nuts towards the end of the game, they seriously can use all the stats
[3:05:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Someone call PETA
[3:05:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Murdering all the Not-Elmos
[3:05:26] <element_of_loyalty> MOM
[3:05:27] <+resstarr> I think the big ones are a bit tougher
[3:05:27] <KatabolicRage> aint so cute anymore
[3:05:28] <%crimsonharvest> Another DQ staple is taht when you cross a bridge, mosnters get stronger. Never forget it's important.
[3:05:31] <%SaltyDongs> big kittens
[3:05:34] <TheBlankAce> Uhhhh

[3:07:07] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you can also switch characters out in battle without losing a turn so long as it isnt that character's turn
[3:07:09] <%whistlehunter> Found the Cave of Kratos in ACOdyssey
[3:07:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yabba dabba do

[3:07:29] <mercado94> @whistlehunter excuse me, cave of kratos?
[3:07:32] <+ChaosVulpes> You haven't done enough damage to the ecosystem until you start slaughtering metal slimes
[3:07:33] <%PipIV> EXTINCT
[3:07:34] <42nfl19> NO PAT, YOU HAVE TO KILL THEM ALL TO GET THE BIG NUMBA
[3:07:44] <Fujiwara_92> TUNR BASED FTW

[3:07:51] <+tigerfang86> NERD CLEPS
[3:07:53] <+tigerfang86> CLEMPS
[3:07:57] <BeanTacoMuncher> Clemps will never not be made fun of
[3:08:00] <element_of_loyalty> WE SLEEP
[3:08:00] <%AncelDeLambert> I have yet to begin the second part of any story in Octopath.... yeah fug turn based
[3:08:08] <Donchalant402> clemps is a good boi, no bully
[3:08:09] <DracaenaLeaf> It is now day 2
[3:08:09] <dekkitout> antiquated some might say, but so's a good handy, and you know what, theyre both fine
[3:08:11] <%PipIV> I love the little rat
[3:08:19] <+ChaosVulpes> I enjoy turn based RPGs a great deal
[3:08:19] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat You forgot to add PIP PIP to the end of that for the full Clempsy flavor.
[3:08:21] <tarkus_awesome> don't forget your respirator
[3:08:21] <%whistlehunter> @mercado94 ye its apparently the cave that was used by the persians to get behind spartan lines, at least according to the game
[3:08:21] <%Kirijuo> "Turned based is so outdated, it's a sign of bad game design" ~ Video Game Journalists
[3:08:29] <+NaDeusX> I think the best part about this game is that you really feel like you're traveling because of the voice acting
[3:08:31] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat stop actively killing cobblestone rooKek
[3:08:36] <%SaltyDongs> that a digimon
[3:08:41] <+Sasorei> I never listen to video game journalists lol
[3:08:42] <%AncelDeLambert> turnips are meant to die
[3:08:47] <%crimsonharvest> These being slimes, Erik would use his ooze move on them if his AI allows it
[3:08:48] <KatabolicRage> the best part about this game is the typed accents are actually less horrible than they used to be
[3:08:50] <%PipIV> Continue the onslaught! Destroy. Them. All.
[3:08:50] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat greatsword blocks counterattack
[3:08:56] <%SuperCasualBoom> The Big Show the wrestler, loves turned based games...😎
[3:08:59] <KatabolicRage> DQ5 sancho was pretty baaad
[3:09:09] <+FeVaRi024> I wish I had time to put into JRPGs. Gotta wait 2 whole months just to tackle Xeno2 DLC. And Smash'll be out then.
[3:09:11] <%PipIV> @supee

[3:09:34] <Fellmouse> what a stump chump, always asleep on the job
[3:09:35] <lokiluko> well atleast you came back quick. so people who hid are played dead might have a shot. The Mongols sent people back afterward to take care of those fuckers. Gotta be thorough
[3:09:35] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Murder the sleeping, makes for an easy kill
[3:09:37] <+FeVaRi024> Erik has an ability that does quad damage to sleeping enemies
[3:09:39] <Magnetgear> bet that pat will be lvl 15 by the time he gets the orb
[3:10:02] <+ChaosVulpes> He does have multiple pages of goods to browse... make sure to press right
[3:10:05] <wsintai> @Magnetgear "So I did some grinding off screen...."
[3:10:06] <Fujiwara_92> there's more stuff on his inventory @AngriestPat
[3:10:07] <%SuperCasualBoom> @pipiv Actually, it’s a joke of The Big Show constant turning good and bad guy frequently.

[3:15:21] <%Superstarsage> Daggers of divinity
[3:15:24] <Fellmouse> the game is putting it on THICC
[3:15:25] <mercado94> WHile the iron is hot you say?
[3:15:25] <Frozenflame01> No worries Pat is super easy to do
[3:15:25] <beefcakemanthrob> you were buying equipment like a chump

[3:15:41] <xeros720> you're gonna craft and you're gonna like it first
[3:15:44] <%Everpresent_Overseer> but it's a fun sized forge
[3:15:45] <%Remery_> He basically gave you his used condom
[3:15:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Saving is for CHUMPS

[3:16:00] <%SaltyDongs> to bad
[3:16:02] <DracaenaLeaf> Third day village gone
[3:16:04] <%Everpresent_Overseer> no save, only crafting
[3:16:08] <%Superstarsage> RIP
[3:16:19] <+ChaosVulpes> Forge will never fail to make the item, and reworking will never make an item worse. Just remember that.
[3:16:20] <%iwishthiswasicq> I can't wait for Pat to completely forget that forge exists next time.
[3:16:21] <%crimsonharvest> camp fire to camp
[3:16:21] <Donchalant402> campfire

[3:16:56] <%AncelDeLambert> where's the smore?
[3:17:00] <%crimsonharvest> Crafting mats are so plentiful in the early game as to be unlimited.
[3:17:01] <sparrrow_> dagger
[3:17:03] <KatabolicRage> also party chat in your menu is often a good idea to get party members opinions on the area your in or the situation
[3:17:11] <KatabolicRage> if you care about their opinion anyways
[3:17:13] <Magnetgear> SAVE SCUMMING FTW
[3:17:14] <%Kghaleon> It's easy, crafting for babies.
[3:17:14] <%AncelDeLambert> I call shenanigans on this camp, no smores, fifty yard penalty!
[3:17:15] <+ChaosVulpes> You will always make the item even if you fuck up bad, so don't worry about it
[3:17:16] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you cant savescum the alchemy, if you try there will be a 5 minute cooldown before you can use the forge again
[3:17:29] <%Remery_> POUND IT
[3:17:33] <%Keyd00d> POUND IT
[3:17:35] <%Everpresent_Overseer> you get a copper sword, he gets a Divine dagger
[3:17:38] <%SaltyDongs> BEAT IT
[3:17:38] <dekkitout> dammit, it knows!
[3:17:39] <+Helghast102> i've got a portapounder

[3:17:51] <%PipIV> best it beat it
[3:17:51] <+Grayhammatter> bash, then finish
[3:17:54] <wsintai> Its super easy and for babies
[3:18:01] <%AncelDeLambert> pound it like a twink, Pat!
[3:18:06] <%DedlokPM> @Helghast102 a very small one. teenJOY
[3:18:06] <%Kghaleon> Just bash them into the green zone and finish, nothing easier.
[3:18:07] <%Keyd00d> pat is so afraid
[3:18:11] <%Ferakin> Its honestly an incredibly simple minigame
[3:18:11] <+ChaosVulpes> You will always make the item, even if you fuck it up. You just won't get the +1 or whatever... but you can always rework the item later to get it up there if you really need to. :3
[3:18:12] <+chetasaur> 14 crafting?
[3:18:13] <+resstarr> PogChamp

[3:18:31] <wsintai> @AngriestPat +3 is maximum
[3:18:31] <%PipIV> but why tho?
[3:18:32] <%AncelDeLambert> WHAT A MINIGAME
[3:18:33] <Magnetgear> +3 it is
[3:18:34] <beefcakemanthrob> no
[3:18:34] <Fellmouse> yes
[3:18:34] <Donchalant402> it gets harder
[3:18:35] <sparrrow_> no
[3:18:36] <+ChaosVulpes> You literally can not do better than that
[3:18:36] <wsintai> NO
[3:18:36] <%crimsonharvest> (this is a tutorial gimmie)
[3:18:36] <dekkitout> tajWUT its perfect
[3:18:37] <TheyCallMeVawn> Not yet
[3:18:37] <KatabolicRage> it can be.. a bit random how much you fill up the bars
[3:18:38] <%Remery_> No
[3:18:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> AMAZING
[3:18:39] <+Grayhammatter> later on it is
[3:18:39] <TheyCallMeVawn> It gets harder
[3:18:40] <Heyestus> it's the first one, dumb dumb
[3:18:40] <+resstarr> no but its entirely RNG
[3:18:40] <+ChaosVulpes> FINISH
[3:18:40] <beefcakemanthrob> it will get hard though
[3:18:40] <sparrrow_> TUTORIAL
[3:18:41] <redwilt> It gets harder
[3:18:41] <+Sinister_Aglet> it's a tutorial pat
[3:18:41] <Fujiwara_92> IT GETS HARDER
[3:18:43] <mercado94> is a tutorial you dummy
[3:18:44] <Warbot40> Gets hard later
[3:18:44] <zal_silverfang> tutorial weapon
[3:18:44] <%badchoice5> FINISH THE DAMN DAGGE
[3:18:44] <+ShogunNoonto> Wow
[3:18:44] <pectusumbra> no, yeah, it's clearly a tutorial one
[3:18:44] <+tegas_> This is tutorial, it gets a lol crazier.
[3:18:45] <%Keyd00d> TUTORIAL
[3:18:45] <+miki_d92> It gets a lot harder
[3:18:49] <+miki_d92> Tutorial OP
[3:18:50] <$ooblagis> You beat the slime equivalent of crafting
[3:18:52] <Magnetgear> BABY FORGING
[3:18:52] <killerking> its the tutorial
[3:18:53] <reonome> its the fucking tutorial pat
[3:18:54] <%ssjklyco> tutorial
[3:18:54] <%AncelDeLambert> I, too, am confused
[3:18:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YOUR A GENIUS PAT
[3:18:56] <GuyKuzunoha> they mix things up later
[3:18:58] <%crimsonharvest> it gets FF14 mid-50s hard
[3:19:00] <%craig_t> I FINISHED THE TUTORIAL, MY DICK IS THE BIGGEST
[3:19:03] <Donchalant402> +3 is as high as it gets
[3:19:03] <+Sasorei> I don't like crafting in FFXIV :<
[3:19:04] <sirrice77> Pat it gets harder later
[3:19:05] <%Kirijuo> I eventually becomes a puzzle
[3:19:05] <+miki_d92> yeah it's not as hard as 14 easily
[3:19:06] <%TheSniperJoe> It starts off super easy but it ramps up. Lots of spinning plates.
[3:19:07] <+Sasorei> I like crafting here though
[3:19:09] <%AncelDeLambert> perhaps TOO easy for a tutorial?
[3:19:10] <xeros720> this is based on the DQ10 crafting system
[3:19:13] <+FeVaRi024> The +3 does a lot
[3:19:14] <+Sasorei> and in DQX (which is the same thing)
[3:19:15] <%Kghaleon> Wow, +3 is quite good though
[3:19:19] <+Ciphris> imagine it's like crafting a hempan chemise Kappa @AngriestPat
[3:19:27] <xeros720> oh and you can rework anything, even bought or found gear
[3:19:27] <Donchalant402> so if you fuck up going to plus 3 you can still pearl it up to 3
[3:19:28] <+ChaosVulpes> A +3 item is a perfect item, you can't make it better than that.
[3:19:34] <%AncelDeLambert> POUND the sword, Pat
[3:19:42] <sirrice77> @angriestpat what makes FF14 crafting hard?
[3:19:42] <%Keyd00d> the less temperature the less the bar fills
[3:19:44] <%AncelDeLambert> bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk
[3:19:45] <KatabolicRage> THIS is more typical
[3:19:50] <KatabolicRage> best your gonna get without flourishes
[3:19:50] <%Keyd00d> that's fine
[3:19:51] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat So now when you page through equipment stats you can also see the upgrade tier stat changes.
[3:19:52] <beefcakemanthrob> you're done. it's fine
[3:19:54] <reonome> its rng
[3:19:54] <redwilt> GET FUCKED
[3:19:55] <+ChaosVulpes> That's as good as you can make this one
[3:19:56] <Fellmouse> welcome to the real experience
[3:19:57] <Overloard> this Forging technique LUL
[3:19:58] <wsintai> ITS FINE
[3:19:58] <+resstarr> Its random
[3:19:59] <reonome> LUL
[3:19:59] <mercado94> BAD ENDING
[3:20:00] <+ChaosVulpes> Just finish it
[3:20:00] <Donchalant402> the farther you go in the lower the temp gets pat
[3:20:00] <%Keyd00d> ?
[3:20:01] <+Grayhammatter> it's FINE
[3:20:01] <jj_cabo> Its FINE~
[3:20:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YOU FUCKED UP
[3:20:01] <reonome> RNG
[3:20:03] <Fujiwara_92> This is what you'll get most of the time @AngriestPat
[3:20:03] <%Basch71> they just need to be in the zones
[3:20:04] <Magnetgear> RNG
[3:20:04] <%lols_royce> temp affects how much the bar fills
[3:20:04] <+ChaosVulpes> Appraise it
[3:20:05] <%Remery_> RNG
[3:20:06] <Donchalant402> the less the bar goes
[3:20:06] <+KingZaffy> It's RNG how much it goes up by
[3:20:07] <GuyKuzunoha> probably still a +3 tbh
[3:20:08] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Muted!
[3:20:08] <Donchalant402> its not random
[3:20:09] <+Lazyjoules> dead run
[3:20:09] <Fellmouse> RNG
[3:20:10] <dekkitout> OCD! NotLikeThis
[3:20:10] <+rei0> no it is not
[3:20:11] <Donchalant402> look at the number
[3:20:12] <KatabolicRage> this is the best you'll get without flourishes
[3:20:13] <%Keyd00d> IT'S NOT PERFECT BabyRage
[3:20:15] <$ooblagis> More mechanics come in later to make it less awful
[3:20:16] <+DoctorIdiot> Its not random
[3:20:18] <%AncelDeLambert> not GAY enough
[3:20:19] <eco419> is not random is the temp
[3:20:19] <%crimsonharvest> You get moves to make it easier
[3:20:21] <Donchalant402> the farther you go in the lower the temp gets pat
[3:20:21] <Fujiwara_92> APPRAISE IT
[3:20:21] <redwilt> FRUSTRATION GETTING BIGGER
[3:20:22] <Magnetgear> +1
[3:20:22] <+ChaosVulpes> Appraise will tell you how well you did.
[3:20:23] <lesserkarl> it's a random range
[3:20:23] <+Sasorei> @AngriestPat you get abilities to help you control it better later on
[3:20:26] <KatabolicRage> you CANNOT reduce the bars, do NOT bash them again
[3:20:26] <dekkitout> tajWUT START OVER
[3:20:27] <+FeVaRi024> Temperature and focus
[3:20:27] <Warbot40> Somewhat random. Youll get skills later
[3:20:27] <%Everpresent_Overseer> This sword is FLAWED
[3:20:28] <sparrrow_> OCD ATTACK
[3:20:29] <killerking> @angriestpat you get more control over it later
[3:20:30] <+resstarr> You rework it or make a new one
[3:20:31] <+ChaosVulpes> Just finish, it's not a big deal
[3:20:32] <%AncelDeLambert> 3333333
[3:20:32] <Donchalant402> with each hit the bar goes up less
[3:20:33] <lesserkarl> you'll get harder and softer hits later
[3:20:33] <+rei0> your crit is random, yes, your natural hits are calculated by your forge temp
[3:20:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Settin in
[3:20:36] <wsintai> You'll get more options as you level up, dont worry about it Paige @AngriestPat
[3:20:40] <DartonLance> its like ff14 crafting you get alot more abilities to help make it less random
[3:20:40] <beefcakemanthrob> use a pearl if you're that bent outta shape
[3:20:41] <%crimsonharvest> its just this until you get some more smithing moves
[3:20:41] <xeros720> the Flourishes you get later let you control it more later, you're pretty subject to rng right now
[3:20:42] <GuyKuzunoha> don't touch it just finish the job
[3:20:42] <%ssjklyco> SAVE SCUM
[3:20:43] <Fellmouse> mitigatable random
[3:20:45] <%Keyd00d> just stop freaking out and go with it it's fine
[3:20:46] <+cylish> it has a set value based on the tempurature yorue at, each strike causes the tempurature to go down and you get less for the hit
[3:20:46] <+FeVaRi024> The game says, but it's not clear
[3:20:47] <Fujiwara_92> REWORK OR MAKE A NEW ONE
[3:20:47] <+Valison> @AngriestPat Pay attention to the temperature at the top
[3:20:48] <Donchalant402> @ssjklyco you cant
[3:20:52] <+ShogunNoonto> The skills make it less random
[3:20:53] <+solzan2000> oh I love the forge
[3:20:54] <%TheSniperJoe> It isn't totally random, the temp matters, you'll get abilities over time that hit harder or lesser for more temp.
[3:20:54] <KatabolicRage> just finish the sword, you can rework it later if you need to
[3:20:55] <Warbot40> It's fine
[3:20:55] <+tegas_> temp gauge at top goes down, less temp less bar per hit.
[3:20:58] <Donchalant402> DONT
[3:20:58] <KatabolicRage> DO NOT BASH AGAIN
[3:20:59] <%Kghaleon> Pat could never beat this Path of pain.
[3:21:00] <+solzan2000> fun times
[3:21:00] <Warnawl> The more you hit the lowert the temp
[3:21:01] <%badchoice5> NO
[3:21:01] <%crimsonharvest> youre done
[3:21:01] <Warbot40> NO
[3:21:02] <KatabolicRage> YOU WILL RUIN IT
[3:21:03] <%badchoice5> STOP
[3:21:04] <tarkus_awesome> probably have to mix flourishes in when you learn them
[3:21:05] <+cylish> STOP NOW
[3:21:05] <beefcakemanthrob> noooooooo
[3:21:06] <reonome> its a fucking bronze sword pat
[3:21:06] <+ChaosVulpes> The higher the TEMP the more the bar goes up per bash
[3:21:06] <$ooblagis> Basically early on there's just a set pattern to hit it in
[3:21:06] <Fujiwara_92> DONT
[3:21:08] <GuyKuzunoha> no bash
[3:21:08] <redwilt> ITS FINE LEAVE IT
[3:21:09] <%Keyd00d> PAT
[3:21:09] <+graffitisamurai> NOOOOO
[3:21:10] <xeros720> ahaha
[3:21:11] <%crimsonharvest> bars dont go down
[3:21:11] <Donchalant402> this is are far as you can go with this
[3:21:11] <killerking> Dont
[3:21:12] <%lols_royce> a little more cant hurt Kappa
[3:21:13] <+Bupkis7> you're done
[3:21:14] <mercado94> LUL
[3:21:15] <wsintai> @AngriestPat YOU TOUCHED YOUR NOSE
[3:21:16] <%AncelDeLambert> bonk bonk bonk "you brute you vicious brute!" bonk bonk bonk
[3:21:18] <+Grayhammatter> it's just a bronze sword pat
[3:21:18] <+SuichiTanaka> This is a terrible minigame for someone with strong OCD
[3:21:20] <+Sasorei> @AngriestPat even if you fail, you will get the weapon with no +s
[3:21:20] <+cylish> you dont need all yellow to get a good outcome, one or two is perfect
[3:21:21] <+ChaosVulpes> That's a +2
[3:21:22] <+rei0> that's +2, you're good
[3:21:25] <killerking> its fine
[3:21:27] <Archmortal> I was so ready for him to stubbornly hit it again and fuck it all up
[3:21:28] <Fujiwara_92> +2 IS GOOD
[3:21:30] <GuyKuzunoha> okay it's a +2
[3:21:30] <sparrrow_> Pat is a dumb dumb
[3:21:31] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat if appraisal says brilliantly its as good as it gets
[3:21:31] <%Superstarsage> You may not understand but your brain does
[3:21:31] <eco419> its ok
[3:21:32] <+Gravity_Gunner> Can’t you just make hundreds of worthless iron daggers to level up?
[3:21:37] <dekkitout> but it could be a +3 NotLikeThis
[3:21:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Oh GOD!!! MY MIN-MAXING IS RUINED!
[3:21:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Not a +3
[3:21:40] <+graffitisamurai> +2 is great, +3 is the best
[3:21:40] <%Everpresent_Overseer> A FLAWED sword has been forged
[3:21:41] <lesserkarl> you can rework it to +3 whenever you want
[3:21:42] <%PipIV> Dazed, reeling, about to break...
[3:21:43] <%SuperCasualBoom> It’s basic science
[3:21:43] <Donchalant402> yes
[3:21:45] <$ooblagis> +2 is still good
[3:21:46] <Donchalant402> rework it
[3:21:47] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:21:48] <%Basch71> its just a very easy crafting system
[3:21:50] <dekkitout> or maybe even a +4 ResidentSleeper
[3:21:50] <Warbot40> You're good. if it was gold on 2 of them it'd be a +3
[3:21:50] <%crimsonharvest> You got one out of 3 bars perfect, and the other 2 pretty good, thats +2 overall out of +3 maximum
[3:21:51] <%AncelDeLambert> the anger begins
[3:21:51] <beefcakemanthrob> +2 is not bad
[3:21:52] <+resstarr> +2 is fine for this point in the game
[3:21:54] <Donchalant402> perfectly gets you +3
[3:21:54] <sparrrow_> no
[3:21:57] <+Bupkis7> oh my god
[3:21:57] <+kukadin> has it ever been less clear?
[3:21:58] <%Remery_> OCD triggering
[3:21:58] <+Grayhammatter> nope
[3:21:58] <Donchalant402> you ALWAYS get pearls
[3:21:58] <KatabolicRage> you get perfectionist pearls everytime you make a new thing
[3:21:59] <%Basch71> perfect is for +3
[3:21:59] <Fujiwara_92> NO
[3:21:59] <%Superstarsage> *spits out water*
[3:22:00] <redwilt> no just has to be a success
[3:22:00] <xeros720> nah, you only level up your blacksmithing skill from actual combat levels or story progress
[3:22:00] <killerking> Dont worry about it too much
[3:22:02] <%Keyd00d> oh god why
[3:22:03] <%badchoice5> What a waste
[3:22:03] <$ooblagis> Here we go
[3:22:04] <TheyCallMeVawn> Pats losing his mind, someone call Paige
[3:22:04] <zal_silverfang> That would be so stupid
[3:22:05] <pectusumbra> you get pearls to try again
[3:22:06] <+tegas_> Pearls are for a second chance.
[3:22:06] <Archmortal> it said each time you craft one you get a pearl. You literally read it out loud
[3:22:06] <wsintai> Oh god I'll be back in a few hours when Pat figures out this baby crafting game for babies
[3:22:07] <+resstarr> panootsYosh
[3:22:09] <reonome> PAT WHY
[3:22:09] <+KingZaffy> If they all finish in the Green, it's a success. If you get them on the arrows and make them yellow, you make it better. You always get pearls if you succeed.
[3:22:09] <+ChaosVulpes> Making anything higher than the base version gives you pearls
[3:22:10] <count_bob> Pat is confused by the simple crafting system.
[3:22:10] <KatabolicRage> you don't need to do it perfect
[3:22:10] <+Sasorei> @AngriestPat No, you get pearls for +1, +2 or +3, you don't get pearls for failing
[3:22:11] <GuyKuzunoha> no pat you fool
[3:22:13] <+Makasuro> That looks like a dong
[3:22:13] <mercado94> you always get pearls
[3:22:14] <$ooblagis> Nope
[3:22:15] <Fujiwara_92> wasting perls
[3:22:16] <$ooblagis> ded
[3:22:17] <+Lazyjoules> Take the +2 and run
[3:22:18] <beefcakemanthrob> This is Pat's life--confusion
[3:22:18] <%AncelDeLambert> ONE THOUSAND DEGREES
[3:22:19] <+Grayhammatter> you just need to actually finish the item to get pearls
[3:22:21] <xeros720> you really don't need to stress about it
[3:22:23] <SchroedingersFerret> PENIS
[3:22:27] <+graffitisamurai> No, at the worst, you'll just get the base item
[3:22:27] <+cylish> ITS FINE
[3:22:27] <Donchalant402> you're good
[3:22:27] <+solzan2000> lol
[3:22:28] <%Remery_> HAHAHA
[3:22:28] <Warbot40> ITS FINE
[3:22:28] <%lols_royce> LUL
[3:22:28] <+xGreenflame> @AngriestPat the pearls let you reforge and every time you reforge it's easier to get a better result
[3:22:28] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[3:22:28] <+resstarr> oh
[3:22:29] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking hot enough to melt GLASS
[3:22:30] <reonome> ITS A GODDAMN BRONZE SWORD PAT

[3:22:30] <+SuichiTanaka> PAT GO DOWN
[3:22:30] <+Sasorei> that might still be +3
[3:22:31] <sparrrow_> lmao

[3:22:32] <+Sinister_Aglet> GEORGE IS GETTING UPSET
[3:22:33] <Fellmouse> OCD kicks in
[3:22:33] <redwilt> IS good maybe +3
[3:22:35] <%Agami23> ha
[3:22:35] <%Remery_> OCD TRIGGERED
[3:22:35] <+ChaosVulpes> It's fine.
[3:22:36] <%crimsonharvest> probably perfect
[3:22:36] <+cylish> YOURE NEVER GONNA GET ALL YELLOW
[3:22:37] <GuyKuzunoha> +3?
[3:22:37] <%Keyd00d> Pat why are you getitng upset
[3:22:38] <+FeVaRi024> +2
[3:22:38] <eco419> is fine he is learning
[3:22:38] <+rei0> nah, every craft give you fix amount of pearls depending on how difficult what you're crafting, reworking won't give pearls tho @AngriestPat
[3:22:39] <dekkitout> *uninstalls game*
[3:22:39] <mercado94> that could be a +3
[3:22:39] <+donpatrondx> BIG SIGH
[3:22:40] <%Basch71> you get better skills later anyway

[3:22:56] <lucaflow> @AngriestPat hoard the pearls you can use them to recraft equipment you buy in stores even if you don't know the recipe
[3:22:57] <+Gravity_Gunner> This is me in Windhelm all over again
[3:22:58] <+Bupkis7> NO IT"S NOT
[3:22:58] <%Ferakin> Pat proved his dick was bigger than yours
[3:22:59] <%ssjklyco> Look at that FF14 crafting skill
[3:23:00] <%crimsonharvest> you get perls everything you make a new item
[3:23:00] <eco419> he can reload is fine
[3:23:03] <%Meme_Platinum> this isn't how forging works
[3:23:03] <+ChaosVulpes> Yeah, reworking a +2 into a +3 is not hard
[3:23:04] <Warbot40> NOW YOURE CATCHIN ON
[3:23:05] <mercado94> CONGRATULATIONS you wasted some pearls
[3:23:05] <%Remery_> NOW REWORK PAIGE

[3:23:06] <Donchalant402> LATE game item
[3:23:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Ok now make it =10
[3:23:07] <reonome> WHY ARE YOU WASTING PEARLS
[3:23:08] <mr_slaide> You noobs got owned.
[3:23:08] <xeros720> he's gonna tear out the rest of his hair later if he has to +3 everything
[3:23:09] <KatabolicRage> any crafted from scratch item gives you pearls
[3:23:12] <redwilt> END GAME ARMOR
[3:23:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Wasted material though

[3:23:19] <+cylish> Cuz you reworked it
[3:23:19] <%crimsonharvest> You get pearls when you make new items
[3:23:21] <$ooblagis> Because you were recrafitng
[3:23:21] <Donchalant402> forging gets you pearls, not reworks
[3:23:22] <mr_slaide> It's a rework.
[3:23:23] <redwilt> Reworking items uses them up
[3:23:23] <wsintai> Man fuck getting Pep Pops
[3:23:23] <+graffitisamurai> WHY ARE YOU WASTING PEARLS ON BASIC BITXH SWORDS
[3:23:23] <+resstarr> You can't if you used one
[3:23:23] <%Basch71> only for new items
[3:23:24] <pectusumbra> only for new things
[3:23:25] <Maleicus> rework the lupis
[3:23:25] <%Keyd00d> Pat doesn't read
[3:23:25] <Fujiwara_92> REWORK DONT GIVE
[3:23:26] <+ChaosVulpes> Rework doesn't give pearls, it uses pearls
[3:23:28] <Fellmouse> only new items
[3:23:28] <%lols_royce> confusion go up
[3:23:30] <sirrice77> Just view the forge as a cheaper way to get equipment
[3:23:31] <Warbot40> Only if you make it from scratch
[3:23:32] <reonome> pat are you dumb
[3:23:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> LUL

[3:29:21] <Fujiwara_92> COW LVL
[3:29:21] <42nfl19> A WEATHER COW?
[3:29:21] <+Ciphris> random cow
[3:29:22] <%crimsonharvest> If you ever wanted to know why Earthbound was so weird and dumb, DQ is why.
[3:29:22] <redwilt> Cows tell the weather
[3:29:22] <%Remery_> Tip the Cow
[3:29:24] <dekkitout> GO ON TOUCH IT
[3:29:24] <%ssjklyco> A cow, in my JRPG?
[3:29:28] <%AncelDeLambert> play Epona's song, quick
[3:29:28] <jacknerik> its so fucking weird to have somebody in the party with my name
[3:29:29] <+MitchPfitz> if you talk to all the cows you get a chievo
[3:29:31] <+Grayhammatter> a weather cow, yes
[3:29:36] <+Bad1uck> crafting*

[3:29:41] <+Haruharuharuko> a forcowster
[3:29:41] <+ChaosVulpes> All the cows are weather cows. It's a amazing really.
[3:29:47] <KatabolicRage> you know people compare DQ and FF a lot but looking at this game I have to say I think DQ is going stronger right now
[3:29:48] <gamezerox> what, don' t you have those at your home?
[3:29:50] <+FeVaRi024> Cow user with its stand Weather Report
[3:29:53] <icantstopthescreams> Was that poop smoke?

[3:29:58] <%PipIV> The horror...
[3:29:59] <Fujiwara_92> SeemsGood
[3:30:01] <al0nem0nster> Huh, didn't know they used the auto combat system from the monster taming games in the main series now.
[3:30:06] <%AncelDeLambert> nooooo, not the LIPS
[3:30:08] <+resstarr> Sizz hits all targets
[3:30:09] <pectusumbra> probably AoE fire
[3:30:10] <+Grayhammatter> time to SIZZ
[3:30:10] <%Fenrirlives> is that a joke about cow shaped weather vanes?
[3:30:11] <%Keyd00d> pretty sneaky sizz
[3:30:14] <%PipIV> Success so clearly in view... or is it merely a trick of the light?
[3:30:15] <+MitchPfitz> you get an achievement if you talk to all of them
[3:30:17] <KatabolicRage> sizz is groups I think
[3:30:19] <+resstarr> All monsters ina group that is
[3:30:21] <%AncelDeLambert> don't sell the steak, sell the sizzle
[3:30:25] <KatabolicRage> there's three targeting types, single, group, and all
[3:30:26] <+resstarr> not all monsters, that's another spell
[3:30:29] <+Helghast102> Sizz does not hit all targets, Sizz hits a GROUP of enemies
[3:30:32] <Donchalant402> sizz hits groups of enemies, groups are specifically when its a group of the same enemy not all enemies @AngriestPat
[3:30:33] <+bfgcludi> This game is too pretty
[3:30:38] <grayjammer> Down With Sizz
[3:30:38] <%Agami23> taste the meat not the heat
[3:30:50] <redwilt> A group not all remember that

[3:31:47] <%lols_royce> cute tiger rooAww
[3:31:50] <%SaltyDongs> I got my sizz all over everything
[3:31:52] <Donchalant402> sizz hits groups of enemies, groups are specifically when its a group of the same enemy not all enemies @AngriestPat
[3:31:56] <KatabolicRage> enemies are organized into groups
[3:31:56] <%Fenrirlives> WHY DO YOU FOCUS ON THAT ONE COMMENT PAT
[3:31:56] <+Grayhammatter> only one group
[3:31:56] <+ChaosVulpes> Can't wait till Pat gets his mage party member and gets the Boom line of spells. He'll be using so much MP
[3:31:58] <TheyCallMeVawn> By group it means a group of the same monster
[3:31:58] <Fujiwara_92> he evaded
[3:31:58] <%crimsonharvest> "Group" means a homogenous grouping of enemies
[3:31:58] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat story n plot super clitche tho
[3:31:59] <%Kirijuo> But real talk use mp, the fucking earth shits out mp items
[3:31:59] <%Keyd00d> GROUP
[3:32:01] <%clausover> @AngriestPat a group of same enemies
[3:32:01] <pectusumbra> ooooo it's that stupid group shit
[3:32:04] <%AncelDeLambert> FART GAS
[3:32:05] <KatabolicRage> only enemies of the same kind will come together in a group
[3:32:06] <lucaflow> GROUP
[3:32:08] <%Agami23> oh boy.
[3:32:09] <Maleicus> it hits a group of same type of monsters
[3:32:13] <%AncelDeLambert> FART GASAGA
[3:32:14] <Donchalant402> yes
[3:32:15] <%clausover> yes
[3:32:15] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[3:32:17] <+Helghast102> homogenius
[3:32:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> homo-genius
[3:32:17] <Fujiwara_92> yup
[3:32:21] <eco419> gg
[3:32:22] <%SaltyDongs> lame
[3:32:22] <sparrrow_> homo genius
[3:32:22] <%SuperCasualBoom> Doing old school or old style RPGs makes you comfy. Fact!
[3:32:22] <+Bloodxb> yes
[3:32:24] <pectusumbra> boo, yeah, that'd dumb, never liked that
[3:32:24] <%PipIV> Teetering on the brink, facing the abyss
[3:32:24] <%lols_royce> homo-genius?
[3:32:26] <+FeVaRi024> There are Hetero Group spells too
[3:32:26] <lucaflow> yes
[3:32:30] <KatabolicRage> yeah thats just how DQ has always done things
[3:32:31] <%Remery_> Specific Aoe
[3:32:32] <%crimsonharvest> Think of "group" like front row / back row
[3:32:35] <KatabolicRage> enemies come grouped with their own kind
[3:32:35] <lesserkarl> some attacks hit group, some hit ALL
[3:32:35] <%Keyd00d> I am a homo genius
[3:32:37] <filialpails> homogeneous
[3:32:37] <%clausover> @AngriestPat the bang spell is aoe
[3:32:38] <%Ferakin> The Bang spells are the ones you want to use against all enemies
[3:32:39] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:32:40] <awsomesaucekirby> spells are raicist
[3:32:41] <eco419> yeah homo same
[3:32:43] <Donchalant402> you dont want the SUCC?
[3:32:43] <DrMrFeatherhead> Yes
[3:32:48] <+chetasaur> it is i the homo genius
[3:32:50] <%Remery_> Don't run into the Big Ass monster
[3:32:50] <sparrrow_> Lip just wants to succ cummies man leave him alone
[3:32:52] <al0nem0nster> Guess it makes sense, evolves form, hit that thing to, hit things that look like that, to hit all the things that aren't me.
[3:32:52] <Warbot40> Bang, Boomb and Kaboom hit all
[3:32:53] <%Kirijuo> SHOW PAIGE THE DSL MONSTER
[3:32:54] <Fujiwara_92> homophobic spells
[3:32:55] <+ChaosVulpes> There are SINGLE target abilities, GROUP target (which is all enemies that are grouped, like slime A, slime B, slime C) and then ALL, which hits every enemy in the encounter
[3:32:56] <+Grayhammatter> pat doesn't like the S U C C
[3:32:57] <%SuperCasualBoom> We are all homo...sapiens.
[3:32:59] <Gato_Explosivo> Is that Tora?
[3:33:06] <%AceAlarya> IS THIS TORA?
[3:33:07] <%Keyd00d> JA JAAAN
[3:33:08] <+FeVaRi024> Lips is Clemps' Persona
[3:33:08] <TheBlankAce> Targeting works like this theres Single-> Group-> All and there are a few random hit all skills
[3:33:10] <%lols_royce> ho-modge-in-us
[3:33:10] <eco419> si
[3:33:11] <Fellmouse> It was me, Dio!

[3:36:25] <Fujiwara_92> use the Flint to cut the wood
[3:36:27] <%Remery_> turn back to a doggy
[3:36:30] <%SaltyDongs> I licked my own ass

[3:36:34] <sparrrow_> Patron learned CUT
[3:36:35] <dekkitout> can flint join the party, the bear quota is real low
[3:36:41] <+Shaggnar> Yes
[3:36:46] <mercado94> no
[3:36:48] <Zeemod155> You get costume changes
[3:36:48] <TheBlankAce> There are multiple costumes
[3:36:50] <+resstarr> spoilers: you lose the hood
[3:36:50] <TheyCallMeVawn> Well you can get different outfits, but this is pretty much the default
[3:36:51] <+Bupkis7> There are costumes, but pretty final
[3:36:51] <Fellmouse> Costumes are available
[3:36:51] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat You are going to get several different outfits for each character
[3:36:52] <kite1haseo> you find costumes
[3:36:52] <GASHUNK0> maybe so
[3:36:52] <beefcakemanthrob> that outfit is final, but you can change your costume
[3:36:52] <+solzan2000> ^
[3:36:54] <%TheSniperJoe> there are costumes, you can craft outfits.
[3:36:54] <+MitchPfitz> you can get cosmetics
[3:36:55] <gamezerox> temporary costumes
[3:36:55] <Fujiwara_92> You'll change apperance
[3:36:56] <+ChaosVulpes> You can get other armor that changes your look for ALL the characters
[3:36:56] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat yours items change appearance
[3:36:58] <KatabolicRage> there are armour that are costumes yes
[3:36:59] <GuyKuzunoha> you get cool costumes
[3:37:01] <TheNewJapanGuy> Rare costumes
[3:37:07] <KatabolicRage> but your basic "not wearing anything special" outfit is that
[3:37:08] <+Arbal3st> There's unique costumes. but this is the base costume
[3:37:08] <+resstarr> you get costumes for your other party members tooo
[3:37:12] <mercado94> LUL
[3:37:19] <Donchalant402> even that hood you have right now its because an item you have on @AngriestPat
[3:37:23] <Warbot40> It's just an accessory piece. Some armor changes your costume.
[3:37:25] <%PipIV> sturdy
[3:37:25] <+ChaosVulpes> All party members get multiple costume armors, and most are actually really good armor
[3:37:26] <heatrashes> i still can't get over erik's titty window
[3:37:27] <+Mikatonic> HOW DID HE EVEN
[3:37:35] <al0nem0nster> magic
[3:37:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The village is being murdered
[3:37:35] <Maleicus> lumberjack magic
[3:37:37] <al0nem0nster> wood magic
[3:37:40] <KatabolicRage> old yggy
[3:37:42] <%laserbeaming> So, literal fix broken bridge trope? played straight?
[3:37:45] <%crimsonharvest> Iggy
[3:37:48] <SchroedingersFerret> So Tomo-chan wa Onnanoko actually went somewhere tonight.
[3:37:50] <DracaenaLeaf> That's how you pronounce Ygg?
[3:37:50] <%PipIV> she's built like a steakhouse, but moves like a bistro
[3:37:53] <KatabolicRage> oh if you hate tropes don't play this game
[3:37:55] <Magnetgear> @heatrashes sex appeal
[3:37:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> i love it when you ask a specific question and chat responds with YES
[3:37:58] <Fujiwara_92> 'ol magick
[3:37:58] <eco419> stupid tree
[3:38:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Shut up and listen to Pat's father, everybody
[3:38:03] <%SuperCasualBoom> Lil Ygg
[3:38:03] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat to be honest, while full customization is great, I think slowly updating character design is the sickest shit, and it needs to be pushed
[3:38:03] <sparrrow_> this is now named the Naruto Bridge
[3:38:03] <+ChaosVulpes> Most tropes are played pretty straight in DQ
[3:38:06] <dekkitout> always with the yggdrasil ResidentSleeper
[3:38:06] <Donchalant402> @SchroedingersFerret thanks for the heads up
[3:38:07] <al0nem0nster> burn the tree!
[3:38:09] <zal_silverfang> Tree of Mana Much?
[3:38:16] <Futurecity10> Yggdrasil is the most over used fucking thing in japanese media
[3:38:21] <eco419> nord folk
[3:38:21] <dekkitout> ^
[3:38:22] <%crimsonharvest> I guess it makes sense that a forrester would know about the world tree
[3:38:29] <%AncelDeLambert> @Futurecity10 it really is
[3:38:31] <+ChaosVulpes> @al0nem0nster You say that...
[3:38:31] <al0nem0nster> ...wait but the tree floats....how are their roots poking through?
[3:38:35] <Gato_Explosivo> If Yggdrasil is floating in the sky with nothing touching the ground how is the root there?
[3:38:35] <Donchalant402> @SchroedingersFerret hot damn that was some CUTE SHIT
[3:38:36] <KatabolicRage> this is the first time I recall yggy being in dragonquest tbh
[3:38:41] <%lols_royce> "if you rub a grass type pokemon on it, it will evolve"
[3:38:41] <%craig_t> help, help, the japs are stealing my proud nordic heritage
[3:38:41] <Fujiwara_92> like the Luminare?
[3:38:42] <%Agami23> yggdrasil is the most overused magic tree
[3:38:45] <KatabolicRage> but then I've mostly played the zenithian games
[3:38:45] <%SuperCasualBoom> More YggDRAGsil am I right?
[3:38:49] <+MitchPfitz> if thje tree is flying what does it have living roots in the earth?
[3:38:50] <%PipIV> can you smoke it?
[3:38:56] <eco419> yea
[3:38:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Incorrect. HIGH SCHOOL is the most overused thing in Japanese media.
[3:39:00] <%PipIV> k
[3:39:03] <Fellmouse> It's believe that Yggdrasil allows anime to be translated into English
[3:39:07] <AnacondaVirtue> Rasi-what?
[3:39:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @GabeSweetMan ... fuck
[3:39:11] <Donchalant402> Yggdrasil is in most DQs
[3:39:12] <%laserbeaming> Raziel?
[3:39:12] <$TheNeedlesD> Raziel isn't a tree, it's a vampire Pat
[3:39:13] <%crimsonharvest> You can't blame DQ for overusing a thing it invented
[3:39:19] <%crimsonharvest> well you can nvm
[3:39:21] <Fujiwara_92> ain't Raziel a demon
[3:39:21] <eco419> mmmmm tru
[3:39:31] <%SaltyDongs> Yay the patron bridge dattebayo
[3:39:34] <%badmr7> had do you like eric so far?
[3:39:34] <Mexrage> they named the tree after Raziel from Soulreaver!?
[3:39:37] <%craig_t> @crimsonharvest they didn't "invent it"
[3:39:38] <dekkitout> see i dont even know what a raziel is, but it sounds cool as shit!
[3:39:39] <al0nem0nster> Raziel would probably be portrayed as evil, evil trees are uncommon.
[3:39:40] <%laserbeaming> Raziel is an Angel, actually
[3:39:40] <zal_silverfang> @Futurecity10 and all the varients of "life trees" that make up the trope. though it makes sense since the japanese will see trees to be sacred and deities in their own rights so could explain why it is so previlent
[3:39:49] <%SaltyDongs> steal from him
[3:39:49] <TheBlankAce> DQ has been using yggdrasil since the SNES its pretty much ingrained
[3:39:50] <Donchalant402> big thievery
[3:39:53] <%PipIV> Castiel?
[3:39:54] <%crimsonharvest> @craig_t they invented using it as the deity in RPGs
[3:39:54] <%craig_t> yggdrasil is germanic myth
[3:39:54] <%Agami23> know who are good tree's? argonians
[3:39:57] <$hatesdps> and this is where i fought zabuza on this bridge
[3:39:58] <%AncelDeLambert> give us wisdom, Father of Pat
[3:40:03] <KatabolicRage> god the pot smash animation is so hilairious to me

[3:40:10] <sparrrow_> book
[3:40:10] <mentalgaminguk> book
[3:40:14] <%crimsonharvest> thats all i meant
[3:40:15] <+ChaosVulpes> Yggdrasil is the world tree from Norse mythology that connects the nine realms. Has a big ass eagle at the top and a dragon gnawing on the roots, and a really bitter squirrel that runs messages along the tree for the gods and between said eagle and dragon.
[3:40:21] <eco419> book bby
[3:40:21] <%AncelDeLambert> ANGRISH POT BREAKING
[3:40:22] <%laserbeaming> Ignore the books, ignorance is Bliss
[3:40:26] <+Sasorei> DQ has been using yggdrasil since 3, though the english release it was just called the world tree
[3:40:27] <hntronium> Raziel isn't a vampire, its an angel
[3:40:27] <Maleicus> 1 whole point
[3:40:28] <Fellmouse> time to portapound

[3:40:39] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat Bookshelf
[3:40:47] <%badmr7> I wonder if the tree likes people who go into other peoples homes and bust shit up
[3:40:48] <sparrrow_> Pat is fucking blind
[3:40:49] <%laserbeaming> A Scale Armoire
[3:40:49] <%Divryne> Raziel is my ass.
[3:40:54] <%crimsonharvest> Scale shield first appears in DQ 1 if I'm not mistaken
[3:40:55] <%PipIV> since when does a protagonist read?
[3:40:57] <%Divryne> LUL
[3:40:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> this forge isn't exactly "fun sized"

[3:41:07] <%craig_t> @crimsonharvest jrpgs. i don't think it was a good, but there was a norse dnd setting for ad&d iirc
[3:41:07] <%SuperCasualBoom> Don’t buy the Yddrasil Vagicial

[3:43:55] <+FeVaRi024> I guess
[3:43:58] <%ssjklyco> It could have been a +5
[3:43:58] <+Bloodxb> CRAZY TALK
[3:43:59] <xeros720> the only time you'd really want to care about +3ing things is by end game, and you have a shit load of flourishes you can do
[3:44:00] <+resstarr> FUCK OFF

[3:44:38] <+graffitisamurai> Pat stop wasting Pearl's reworking this early game gear
[3:44:39] <al0nem0nster> SO that's crazy talk requiem, crazy talk affects everyone aware of Pat, but only effects alters Pat based reality.
[3:44:39] <xeros720> little does pat know, he activated our trap cards
[3:44:39] <mercado94> im comfy and upset
[3:44:40] <%badchoice5> I think this level of OCD might actually be reaching my limits
[3:44:44] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat yes pat, you're very good at the minigame, we're all very impressed
[3:44:45] <zal_silverfang> @al0nem0nster n..no. Bakana. Pat.. Pat is gaining Control over Crazy Talks World Manipulation powers!
[3:44:47] <Maleicus> but can you see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch
[3:44:48] <xeros720> all of them, all at once
[3:44:49] <Magnetgear> @AngriestPat Just dont waste your pearls later down the line
[3:44:50] <Hackmandotcom> so when do you fly the space train to the world tree?
[3:44:54] <Donchalant402> oh
[3:44:54] <handsomejohnnys> Wait, is your name Patron because you buy stuff or because you're half robot?
[3:45:00] <Donchalant402> this is for a sidequest
[3:45:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Weaponized Autism
[3:45:02] <Donchalant402> IIRC
[3:45:02] <KatabolicRage> pfft, DQ9 reference
[3:45:04] <+ChaosVulpes> That book is a sidequest item for like... 50 hours from now
[3:45:07] <Fujiwara_92> need time reverse
[3:45:10] <Happy_Karl> But the amount the bar move every hit is different each time. It's a fucking dice roll depending on what option you choose.
[3:45:13] <KatabolicRage> man I liked DQ9 despite the party system
[3:45:13] <+ChaosVulpes> So remember it!
[3:45:23] <%PipIV> @sphincter_spelunker Pat is the fabled 4chan?
[3:45:30] <Donchalant402> because you can rework it
[3:45:32] <Donchalant402> with pearls
[3:45:35] <sparrrow_> Pat is a poopy boy
[3:45:35] <%ssjklyco> Its a little depressing that he has two beds and it's just him living alone (flint)
[3:45:35] <thisisacoolguy> i wish i could talk in boops
[3:45:39] <%crimsonharvest> YOu can rework store bought gear too pat
[3:45:40] <%clausover> @AngriestPat aoe and can be reworked

[3:45:55] <+xXCrustybunsXx> The pig has mana bar!

[3:46:01] <Donchalant402> hat shamwitch
[3:46:02] <dekkitout> that. is. precious. the piggo is cute too, i guess...
[3:46:03] <+FeVaRi024> Best name
[3:46:04] <42nfl19> DID YOU SEE THE NAME PAT?
[3:46:05] <Coystick> EAT THE HAT BACON
[3:46:05] <sparrrow_> Ham Sandwich
[3:46:07] <%PipIV> EAT THAT PIG
[3:46:13] <eco419> does the pearl cost go up with every rework ?
[3:46:13] <KatabolicRage> don't worry about that shit early on man
[3:46:14] <+Sasorei> sasoreSSS
[3:46:17] <pectusumbra> bubble slime my ass, they will always be Babbles in my heart
[3:46:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> He doesn't know LUL
[3:46:18] <Donchalant402> yes pearls when you get them
[3:46:19] <%crimsonharvest> Later you can buy pearls for extremely cheap and I"ll spoil it now to save Pat the anguish
[3:46:21] <Donchalant402> *use
[3:46:21] <xeros720> love these pigs and their puns
[3:46:22] <sparrrow_> Because that item will be outclassed really soon
[3:46:25] <al0nem0nster> I'm guessing because they're a limited resource and later in the game it gets harder and harder to upgrade things
[3:46:28] <+ChaosVulpes> Later on you can literally BUY PEARLS at a store and rework to your heart's content
[3:46:28] <Fujiwara_92> dont worry about... you're early game yet
[3:46:29] <thisisacoolguy> You can literally buy as many pearls as you want later
[3:46:30] <Donchalant402> dont worry about using them
[3:46:31] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> don't worry about pearls you can just buy them later
[3:46:31] <al0nem0nster> so you want as many retries as possible
[3:46:32] <+Bupkis7> Things will start costing like 10 pearls
[3:46:34] <zal_silverfang> Cause they will get MUCH harder and it isnt worth using them on lower end items
[3:46:34] <%PipIV> he s throwing his pearls at swine
[3:46:41] <element_of_loyalty> Bed time.
[3:46:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Learned it from you dad
[3:46:52] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you cant buy pearls till postgame
[3:46:53] <dekkitout> scumbag, actually
[3:46:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Im not a dirtbag
[3:46:55] <al0nem0nster> how much do they cost?
[3:46:55] <42nfl19> But does Pat buy pearls for Paige?
[3:47:02] <%crimsonharvest> 100g per
[3:47:03] <kite1haseo> uhnKiss uhnKiss uhnKiss
[3:47:05] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Lips is Pats favorite monster
[3:47:05] <+resstarr> really hate the feet on the mushroom
[3:47:05] <%ssjklyco> 80 hours into the game
[3:47:05] <%GarbageNirvana> I see myself as more of a trashbag
[3:47:06] <xeros720> yeah i was gonna ask if there's an early place for pearls
[3:47:07] <%badchoice5> Pat will save an elixir til the post game because he might need it, but he'll blow resources he doesn't know he'll get again on trivial improvements
[3:47:07] <count_bob> Pat if we weren't dirtbags, you'd think something was wrong.
[3:47:10] <sparrrow_> Pat hates grandmas confirmed
[3:47:11] <thisisacoolguy> you should eat the mushroom
[3:47:14] <%PipIV> @element_of_loyalty g'night!
[3:47:17] <BigNerdSam> the lips
[3:47:22] <+ChaosVulpes> You can buy pearls as soon as you reach the mini-medal school
[3:47:25] <+SuichiTanaka> Cause they're permanent upgrades, therefore better
[3:47:27] <%Kirijuo> Pat don't waste the pearls even though literally everyone who played this game probably used pearls on these items too
[3:47:28] <Coystick> Toriyama is weird
[3:47:29] <+Arbal3st> no you can buy pearls like very early mid-game
[3:47:31] <eco419> yeeeea one shot
[3:47:32] <KahtaLzargo> Gnight
[3:47:33] <KatabolicRage> dude thats too much detail
[3:47:34] <barucasanova> this series has like the most charming enemy design
[3:47:34] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> but really don't worry about hitting those +3 this early you are going to be rotating equipment really quickly
[3:47:34] <+kukadin> A "brace"?
[3:47:35] <kambamdamn> A lipsies
[3:47:35] <+trnzero> @AngriestPat do you buy pearls for paige in an attempt to rework her?

[3:48:02] <dekkitout> being overleveled is great
[3:48:05] <icantstopthescreams> Pat might be overleveled for the area
[3:48:06] <%Keyd00d> LIES
[3:48:06] <%Meme_Platinum> BURN IT
[3:48:08] <TheyCallMeVawn> Pat almost lost his mind at the forge

[3:50:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 50m 25s.
[3:50:24] <%SaltyDongs> baby
[3:50:33] <+ChaosVulpes> Fight Wisely is actually a pretty good option if you just want to auto-pilot grind
[3:50:35] <%DedlokPM> Order of Camera importance: 1. Elmo 2. Paige 3. Skelmo 4. Steve Buscelmo 5. Pat 6. Shellmo @AngriestPat
[3:50:36] <+NeutrinoInteraction> Whatever localizer came up with "Sham Hatwitch" deserves a goddamn medal, like that's RESOURCEFUL
[3:50:37] <xeros720> you can use L2 as a confirm button as well, true one hand gaming
[3:50:38] <+Bupkis7> @Sphincter_Spelunker No, I'n pretty sure these are even older ones.
[3:50:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Better Peach confirmed for Smash @AngriestPat
[3:50:47] <eco419> best feelin in a game
[3:50:47] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat You're not the type of person to get OCD about filling a bestiary right? Because some enemies have rare colored variant that can REALLY RARELY spawn in
[3:50:52] <+bigbradish> I also do that
[3:50:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Bupkis7 Damn

[3:51:37] <zal_silverfang> Tell Elmo i said hello
[3:51:42] <gamezerox> Tell her I also say hi and that's from some random person on the internet
[3:51:50] <+ChaosVulpes> Some of those rare colored monster variants (most of which are a lot tougher than their normal counterparts) are targets for several sidequests
[3:51:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No one ever says Hi to Skelmo
