[0:05:31] <%lewdskeletor13> I think he’s doing the main campaign? I could be weong
[0:05:33] <%Sirculbs> I saw "For Honor" and got excited. Now I'm sad. But happy. But sad.
[0:05:35] <musti_jaja_> and Sony should get rid of state of play and start over
[0:05:36] <bushbabyomega> Ahh. Don't forget, we have the final campaign releasing in April as well as the amiibo 3 pack
[0:05:44] <%lewdskeletor13> @konekoryugamine Howdy apatDab
[0:06:03] <%Toynota10> He's already beaten Shovel Knight, but he said he hasn't finished Plague's or even touched Spectre
[0:06:07] <CybertronPrime> Sony's State of Play wanted to be a Nintendo Direct so bad.
[0:06:13] <Dio_TR> In case anyone is interested they released a new patch for vampire the masquerade bloodlines 10.3 if you're planning on playing it
[0:06:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh well maybe Strident lied to me then
[0:06:26] <%lewdskeletor13> sipsipHellmo

[0:29:07] <%UncleAWOL> don't make fun of the baby
[0:29:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also weirdly mushrooms are supposed to help with fucked up unmanageable cluster headaches
[0:29:07] <%konekoryugamine> OH yeah, that's what happens tpo me. That's just when I go for the ol'fashioned ITTD: ibuprofen, tylenol, tea, darkness
[0:29:10] <%connos_livereview> drugs work for me thankfully becuase im a daywalker
[0:29:14] <+darkmithrionx> Hey hey hey, leave the BABY alone
[0:29:14] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat hot water on the back of your neck also helps relieve muscle tension that can aggravate migraine. Oddly enough I've found that hot FOLLOWED BY cold assists mine. Except when it doesn't and, as you said, I feel WAAAAYYY worse for it.
[0:29:14] <Badasshy> Hello Elmo you good boy
[0:29:16] <%konekoryugamine> Wait, mushrooms?

[1:16:40] <$jean_kirschtein_neigh> Howdy my sixth-favorite Canadian (after Trebek, Devin Townsend, Jim and Colin from RLM, and Woolie)
[1:16:40] <%lewdskeletor13> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:16:41] <Zer0beats> turrible
[1:16:42] <+Noni321> No, it's because his chest is beefy
[1:16:43] <+BringBackSempai> hit the bomb!
[1:16:44] <%SrG00SE> thats why they call me chester when your mom's around
[1:16:45] <alrobot2014> oh god i never realized that
[1:16:51] <On_Target> Trebek is Canadian?
[1:16:52] <%dukenux> took 5 years
[1:16:55] <%Prevot> today pat is the one who's sundowning
[1:16:56] <JoeNeutrino> @Toynota10 No. I guess I'm out of the loop!
[1:16:56] <%konekoryugamine> YOU SERIOUS?!
[1:16:57] <californaya> Watching this just makes me want to play it
[1:16:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Them Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde bombs tho
[1:17:05] <%konekoryugamine> HA
[1:17:05] <californaya> I never did Spectre Knight
[1:17:06] <SomersaultJustice> RESET
[1:17:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> hey so someone was talking about shovel knight amiibo is that 3 pack ever gonna come out
[1:17:08] <krymzen5> ruined
[1:17:09] <silverira> why king knight would make secret passages that only shovel knight can use
[1:17:14] <+코코꾸라> RESET
[1:17:17] <%Toynota10> @joeneutrino Plus Shovel Knight's been in so many indie games AND smash. shovel Knight's a huge success lol
[1:17:19] <On_Target> Spectre Knight's campaign was awesome\
[1:17:22] <+JavaManJoJo> @silverira It's not his castle
[1:17:26] <%JJCheeker> I hope Alex trebek gets better
[1:17:33] <%Toynota10> @joeneutrino it's all good they just announced Cyber Shadow yesterday
[1:17:38] <rufus2k2> Trebek's vid on his condition was stellar
[1:17:43] <rufus2k2> what a guy
[1:17:48] <%konekoryugamine> YOu weren't gonna try and run across the top more?
[1:17:49] <On_Target> yeah, but Cyber Shadow is a game they're publishing by an even smaller developer
[1:17:51] <$jean_kirschtein_neigh> @On_Target That's why he's so good with the French pronunciations
[1:17:54] <+Arkfyre> MOST REFINED GRIFFIN
[1:17:58] <pectusumbra> wonder if anyone has a full list of shovel knight references in other games. I know there's a wall-breaking shovel item in Tangledeep that's a direct reference
[1:17:58] <Zer0beats> {remembering the final boss on the 3ds ] NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:17:58] <silverira> @JavaManJoJo well i bet it is no shovel knight either
[1:17:58] <GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Since we're going back to games, you ever wanna replay RE4 on stream?
[1:18:03] <%Toynota10> Spectre Knight is incredibly fun (and remixed!)
[1:18:04] <b_ikki> yeah cyber shadow isnt theirs
[1:18:05] <%konekoryugamine> A SLIGHTLY lazy swipe!

[1:19:11] <PrinceOfEden> MikeHogu
[1:19:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @LokimenD She would die
[1:19:14] <%GohanEgret> Wii version
[1:19:14] <$megamonmon123> so do you guys think shovel knight needs a sequel?
[1:19:14] <+tigerfang86> NO
[1:19:16] <%waifoong98> LUL
[1:19:16] <%starotter70> Even more reason
[1:19:17] <%Kataguro> Ironic
[1:19:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> paige no shooty
[1:19:18] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[1:19:19] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[1:19:19] <Darren716> Yeah do it
[1:19:19] <%Laecerelius> LUL
[1:19:19] <+tigerfang86> DONT MAKE PAIGE SHOOT
[1:19:20] <%konekoryugamine> RE4 is Metal Gear without it being Metal Gear
[1:19:20] <LiquidMathew> Paige should just play this coop with you
[1:19:21] <%ThatGuyfromMars> But but
[1:19:23] <On_Target> I mean, she made it through RE7... didn't she?
[1:19:24] <%Toynota10> This gamesl's SO GOOD
[1:19:24] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat paige playing RE2Remake?
[1:19:24] <b_ikki> not if she doesnt learn
[1:19:24] <JoeNeutrino> I just watched the Cyber Shadow trailer. It looks goooood.
[1:19:25] <Grunkle_Dan_> She can get better!
[1:19:25] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i still have nightmares of that stream
[1:19:27] <%ElenaManetta> Surprising considering she's American and from a farm
[1:19:27] <%Arxel1> But isn't she American @AngriestPat ?
[1:19:27] <%snow_bush> ME was hilarious, it was great.
[1:19:28] <%Laecerelius> She's BIG AND STRONG but super blind
[1:19:28] <deafmutelaughing> what if she's pointing it at a woman
[1:19:29] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@WizardofWazz) (warning)
[1:19:29] <CrimsonFox777> Swords don't need good eyesight to wield.
[1:19:30] <+gamesasacervix> can paige play resident evil 2 on assisted mode
[1:19:31] <%Rngiddion> doing america proud
[1:19:32] <$jean_kirschtein_neigh> This music is bopping
[1:19:32] <yuribo26> But I thought she was from the south
[1:19:32] <foreverN2dust> Paige swings big swords so she can't miss
[1:19:33] <$shurtal> Which is funny, cause she's from 'Murica
[1:19:34] <%ShinyDemonGuy> ShinyDemonGuy subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:19:34] <%Prevot> paige can let a sword swing her arms
[1:19:34] <aimlesshealer> She can do it BibleThump but you don't believe in her
[1:19:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Have Paige play Elder Scrolls?
[1:19:35] <StaticSunrise> Bloodborne?
[1:19:36] <%dukenux> Paige is a warrior, not a hunter
[1:19:37] <$cureneckbeard> but she's american
[1:19:38] <Nina96> IT HAS 3
[1:19:38] <+Pixel_Matt> Did you see the BL3 Trailer?
[1:19:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> paige can't move and shoot, RE4 doesn't let you move while aiming
[1:19:39] <+Noni321> Have her play DMC5 on DMD difficulty on stream.
[1:19:39] <%JJCheeker> She could just use a knife Kappa
[1:19:39] <TwinBat> should've had her played dragon age instead of mass effect
[1:19:40] <%deviljhojho94> What about dmc5 Kappa
[1:19:41] <%LokimenD> Knife only run then LUL
[1:19:42] <%Cavumentum> Black Knight Chronicles
[1:19:42] <PlatinumWyvern> dmc5
[1:19:44] <SomersaultJustice> ever considder doing ff5 on stream?
[1:19:45] <%Solidnick18> it's got dlc
[1:19:45] <buffmurffy> sequal as a 3d platformer maybe?
[1:19:46] <+reddpop_> I want to see YC do a new game
[1:19:46] <+tigerfang86> imagine believing in PAIGE
[1:19:49] <+gamesasacervix> can paige play sekiro
[1:19:50] <%konekoryugamine> HA
[1:19:50] <%dukenux> Paige hates TAU
[1:19:51] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat when paige gonna do REmake 2?
[1:19:51] <yuribo26> Just make Shield Knight
[1:19:53] <Thalchampz> ruined
[1:19:53] <SkitsofRandom> let them move on from this game, I want something new from them
[1:19:53] <Gieron666> Paige is clearly the warrior in this relationship
[1:19:54] <GoldeNOVA> You can swing a sword blind, you can't shoot blind.
[1:19:54] <%Solidnick18> it's fine
[1:19:56] <%ElenaManetta> Oh yeah, did Pat see the Gungeon upcoming DLC
[1:19:56] <+asgard147> FeelsBadMan
[1:19:57] <+Grayhammatter> ruined
[1:20:01] <%ElenaManetta> Or maybe him retweeting is where I found it out
[1:20:03] <+nicos143> Does it need one? No. Will it get one? One day
[1:20:03] <$megamonmon123> yeah i think shovel knight is a pretty complete package
[1:20:09] <%daisyyyy> In another 5 years, let YC work on something else
[1:20:10] <marvel877> Shovel Knight has a lot, and still one more campaign coming. After that, he deserves some rest.
[1:20:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> Disgraceful. Can't shoot a gun? What kind of American is she?
[1:20:14] <Grunkle_Dan_> Is Paige good at Stealth? I'd eat up some MGS
[1:20:14] <%konekoryugamine> Dude, side wall
[1:20:14] <On_Target> Shovel Knight 2: Too Many Shovel Knights
[1:20:17] <%President_Miyazaki> Wall ore
[1:20:17] <%konekoryugamine> SIDE WALL
[1:20:22] <%konekoryugamine> There ya go
[1:20:25] <%Laecerelius> Dirty
[1:20:25] <$cureneckbeard> That's why she got exiled to Canada
[1:20:28] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat You like the look of YachtClub's new game they announced?
[1:20:28] <globalGinnicide> I'm still waiting on FP2, Shovel Knight can wait
[1:20:31] <%Solidnick18> hello @AngriestPat apatWhat
[1:20:34] <+Noni321> Doesn't hollow knight have a similar enemy to that one?
[1:20:37] <%konekoryugamine> JOurnal>
[1:20:38] <%spiritofmojave> that knight was almost directly from Zelda 2
[1:20:39] <aimlesshealer> I bet Paige could get through Mass Effect with a biotic build
[1:20:40] <+tigerfang86> Pat will do it!!!
[1:20:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm fine with DMC6 happening, even if it sucks DMC5 is basically perfect
[1:20:46] <+reddpop_> Spectre was basically a sequel
[1:20:47] <On_Target> Wait has Pat never played this before outside of the SBF videos
[1:20:48] <b_ikki> yell at him to break the checkpoints instead
[1:20:48] <Solidus_113> don't backseat game woolieMIRIN
[1:20:53] <Zer0beats> find them yoself Kappa
[1:20:54] <%ElenaManetta> REMEMBER KIDS, if Paige is having an affair, keep it a secret cause Pat wants to figure it out for himself
[1:20:57] <Fujiwara_92> OOF
[1:20:59] <%Kirby_Sauce> @dukenux ooooo
[1:21:01] <$spardanwarrior> IIRC Yacht Club is only publishing Cyber Shadow.
[1:21:04] <$megamonmon123> pat the coward
[1:21:05] <extradopeness> Would you say its LODES A MONIE
[1:21:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You know what game needs a sequel less? Transistor
[1:21:07] <SkitsofRandom> @AngriestPat ever considered doing something like an oblivion or skyrim playthrough on stream?
[1:21:07] <$jean_kirschtein_neigh> Ooh pretty bookshelves
[1:21:10] <qo_op> SourPls
[1:21:12] <+reddpop_> King knight looks to be like a whole game's worth of content too
[1:21:13] <+Grayhammatter> big coward, but i respect it

[1:21:16] <%alolanslowpoke> Do not yell at Pat he is SENSITIVE
[1:21:21] <JoeNeutrino> This is undoubtedly one of the best retro game soundtracks ever.
[1:21:21] <+reddpop_> there's like 3.5 shovel knight games
[1:21:22] <On_Target> I mean, Nier super didn't need a sequel but we got one
[1:21:23] <%LokimenD> @AngriestPat who's your favorite knight?
[1:21:23] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat did you see YachtClub's new game they announced?

[1:41:15] <ChoculaUltra> Spectre Knight was Spectre Bae this whole time?!
[1:41:15] <Caidezes> Dick flaps are always good.
[1:41:16] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> @konekoryugamine BOOOOOO
[1:41:19] <%President_Miyazaki> So I just left to watch Max's power ranger's video and came back thinking "Okay, he must be at or just past Specter knight by this time" and sure enough.
[1:41:19] <Ner234> @HentaiSenpai9K Neat
[1:41:20] <indig0bird> For sure
[1:41:21] <rufus2k2> you mean a loincloth?

[1:41:31] <Deano8817> wait is this everyone genderbent run LUL
[1:41:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I wonder if the Shovel has a Skeleton?
[1:41:33] <DaHaLoJeDi> Well it's more like a pussflap
[1:41:33] <MissMalisin> SourPls
[1:41:34] <indig0bird> I'm going nuts over the Noct armor you get post-ARR
[1:41:34] <PopeFantasy> Y are all the bosses female?
[1:41:35] <b_ikki> SourPls
[1:41:36] <Zer0beats> a fem skelton under all that
[1:41:40] <turf_wind_and_fire> The PENILE TOWEL
[1:41:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Spectre Knight has titties
[1:41:42] <ShichiNoBushi> "Puss flap" as Matt and Crymetina call it.
[1:41:43] <Nina96> SourPls
[1:41:45] <%bushbabyomega> The cool thing about Specter Knight is that you can eventually get as powerful as the boss in his campaign
[1:41:47] <alrobot2014> @PopeFantasy genderbend mode
[1:41:56] <$Brother_Coduss> oh hey, it's NOT-DEATH
[1:41:57] <DaHaLoJeDi> @PopeFantasy You can change genders with genderbend mode
[1:41:57] <$Tuskor13> Real question is what does Snow Shovel Knight look like
[1:42:01] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That looks like a fire axe when it spins, memories of Silent Hill strikes again
[1:42:03] <%Laecerelius> Can't belive your Sick Scythe Styles, gurl!
[1:42:04] <deafmutelaughing> more important question: is The Baz female?
[1:42:08] <DraxTD> so what is this... Spectra Knightess?
[1:42:08] <DaHaLoJeDi> of like every boss in the game
[1:42:10] <%konekoryugamine> @AmaniIsYourBoss Tibia honest, I could have done better.
[1:42:15] <Zombrocom> Shovel knight has a genderbend mode now? ...why?
[1:42:16] <ultimate_joker_main> @Cheapheatmo no
[1:42:17] <Fujiwara_92> this ost Kreygasm
[1:42:19] <DaHaLoJeDi> @Cheapheatmo nah, bonus bosses aren't
[1:42:20] <PopeFantasy> Never knew about it thx
[1:42:21] <ChoculaUltra> so would it be Queen Knight instead of King Knight?
[1:42:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fair and balanced
[1:42:23] <Kalcom> cause bitch
[1:42:23] <deafmutelaughing> well it's useless then
[1:42:25] <$cureneckbeard> SKELETON WARRIORS
[1:42:26] <$Clarke1010> Who technically has the rights to Zubaz? Would it be Matt?
[1:42:27] <%spiritofmojave> @cheapheatmo If only
[1:42:28] <+reddpop_> Why not genderbend?
[1:42:29] <%Exyoh> It's had one for years
[1:42:29] <On_Target> @Zombrocom it was a stretch goal
[1:42:30] <%bushbabyomega> @Zombrocom Fan requests and fanart
[1:42:31] <DraxTD> @Zombrocom shits and giggles?
[1:42:32] <$rytyoung> Spectre knight is dope
[1:42:34] <+Grayhammatter> aw
[1:42:43] <foreverN2dust> Can you play the other modes genderbent as well?
[1:42:46] <%Exyoh> Probably a stretch goal, come to think of it
[1:42:50] <leole11> she can heal by killing its own minions? didn't know that
[1:42:55] <%konekoryugamine> Looks like Spectre Knight has a serious BONE to pick with Shovel Knight

I've also got "actual cannibal shia lebouf" on there, and am trying to work monster hunter monsters into the game. possibly even a dust: an Elysian tale thing? hmm what else can I throw in that would at east kindof fit the setting? not sci-fi, or has to be stripped of sci-fi elements upon entry

[2:08:35] <+Grayhammatter> and then the BAZ
[2:08:36] <%konekoryugamine> Hat Man?
[2:08:36] <%Katmon27> and Kratos on the ps4 i think
[2:08:37] <%Solidnick18> yeee baz
[2:08:37] <%CyborgAV> Oh god, this guy's OC
[2:08:38] <%SergeEXE> Hat Man is indeed the name
[2:08:39] <nukle0nik> a canned Street Fighter II character
[2:08:41] <silverira> and Kratos
[2:08:42] <%DedlokPM> Hat Knight
[2:08:42] <%MegboyManuel> Baz was dope tho
[2:08:44] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Baz is basically someone's OC
[2:08:46] <%bushbabyomega> Hat Knight is fun to battle
[2:08:47] <leole11> isn't he the character that had a ridiculously indepth backstory?
[2:08:47] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah kratos
[2:08:48] <%lewdskeletor13> Kratos too
[2:08:48] <%spiritofmojave> Hat Man is the beeeest
[2:08:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Too bad these extra characters aren't gender bent. I wish there was girl-Baz.
[2:08:51] <troxcree> Reize is inescapable, this OC is in fucking everything.
[2:08:52] <VanLynx> Aren't all characters just someone's OC?
[2:08:53] <nukle0nik> this is the best track in the game tho
[2:08:54] <b_ikki> HATE THIS KID
[2:08:56] <+Grayhammatter> basically naruto
[2:08:56] <Nina96> the backers didnt get gender bends right?
[2:08:57] <%SvenHolgersson> Ew gross dont use that word
[2:09:00] <Artista_AF> Baz is basically an Adoptable OC
[2:09:01] <%mercado94> isn't this guy OC batshit insane?
[2:09:01] <%ElenaManetta> DOiNG GOOD PAT
[2:09:02] <+Darkred28> Reminder that Naruto was a bad manga and anime. moon2S
[2:09:03] <majindusto> BAZ IS AN OC
[2:09:03] <%SvenHolgersson> The N word
[2:09:05] <$Brother_Coduss> Basically naruto but not garbage
[2:09:05] <Cranky_Construct> What's the deal with Rieze exactly?
[2:09:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> But he has Divekicks
[2:09:05] <godzookylives> Also the Battletoads

[2:09:23] <%MegboyManuel> Baz is a universal transcending being
[2:09:23] <+combomaniadeluxe> I mean he's got a divekick so he can't be that bad
[2:09:25] <DocMadfox> Reminder that Naruto porn manga is better than the acutal Naruto manga
[2:09:27] <InfraRedRidingHood_> ???
[2:09:28] <%deviljhojho94> RAZENGAN
[2:09:29] <%SergeEXE> Reize would then become a central character for a later DLC

[2:10:22] <amavii> because it wasnt the official backstory he made up
[2:10:22] <%Toynota10> SPOILERS
[2:10:22] <%deviljhojho94> His OC got mind controlled and he hates that Kappa
[2:10:22] <Nina96> @AngriestPat they made him evil
[2:10:22] <%SvenHolgersson> SPILL THE TEA
[2:10:23] <+Ryutaryi> Really?
[2:10:24] <%Solidnick18> HMMMM
[2:10:25] <%PlainSimpleTailor> STORY TIME
[2:10:25] <Darren716> Why? Hes made so much more important there
[2:10:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 then I told her I fucked up. When she started to laugh in my face and "I told you so" me, I explained I used the spell's radius as a diameter, and that the fog is supposed to be twice as big! she was very sad then. lots of "big fuck"s. have Paige check out Dust: an Elysian tale. good pretty game, and lightly furry enough to in include Eli
[2:10:29] <foreverN2dust> TELL US
[2:10:29] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Youwereeatenbyalid) (warning)
[2:10:31] <majindusto> Dust: an Elysian Tale is so good!
[2:10:31] <NemokillerV> spoiler
[2:10:31] <+Bad1uck> @vanlynx Jesus is OC that got absorbed into canon
[2:10:31] <+yoshkosh20> pat thirsty for gossip
[2:10:32] <troxcree> Reize is supposed to be uncorruptible but he becomes evil in the dlc.
[2:10:32] <$Doster503> Because it changed his oc lmao
[2:10:33] <%AbnormalVoid> because they made him into an interesting character
[2:10:33] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> shovel knight is a nice person, even to chuuni.
[2:10:34] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat DON'T WORRY about it
[2:10:37] <Darren716> Like hes a legit boss in Spectere knight
[2:10:37] <%ElenaManetta> LOL
[2:10:39] <ultimate_joker_main> because it breaks multiple of the rules he has for the character
[2:10:39] <DaHaLoJeDi> Reize is a pretty big character in the DLC
[2:10:40] <NemokillerV> darn it
[2:10:40] <%masked_hero_lucky> Not willingly
[2:10:41] <%waifoong98> LUL he deserves it
[2:10:41] <%ElenaManetta> But villains are the best
[2:10:41] <%Solidnick18> Noooooooo
[2:10:42] <aimlesshealer> They probably made him into an interesting character LUL
[2:10:43] <%Toynota10> WHY WOULD YOU say that
[2:10:45] <leole11> if i remember correctly, raize has a ridiculous amount of backstory, like, pages worth of it
[2:10:46] <%konekoryugamine> AH come off
[2:10:47] <%TombstoneTTromboners> he was brainwashed
[2:10:47] <%cvp5127> mah oc
[2:10:47] <RadicalWeegee> it was kinda cool actually

[2:10:49] <jujuschlempermo> @AngriestPat have u played the other dlc's?
[2:10:50] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat because it actually gave him a cool backstory related to specter knight
[2:10:52] <$valriot> AHAHAHAH self righteous fuck
[2:10:52] <arkv01> but being evil is COOL
[2:10:52] <%Toynota10> Why are you spoiling

[2:46:08] <%Kirby_Sauce> yeah
[2:46:09] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> It's a completely different game now, it's fully 3D
[2:46:09] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Do we have too many Rogue-likes?
[2:46:10] <GoldeNOVA> YES
[2:46:10] <On_Target> I played Shadow of Chernobyl for like an hour. I enjoyed it but it was fucking weird

[2:46:23] <Mr_Strut> YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT
[2:46:27] <CptBritches> Risk of Rain is literally just shooter Binding of Isaac
[2:46:27] <Skaw_Lann> risk of rain is fucking great
[2:46:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> Scalling
[2:46:29] <%Comradeiota> risk of rain has an absurdity to the level of power you can achieve
[2:46:30] <+JavaManJoJo> pat being wrong about something, BIG SURPRISE
[2:46:30] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Risk of Rain looks good, from what I remember
[2:46:34] <%Niney_Who> It's a roguelike
[2:46:34] <%Comradeiota> and power=filling the screen with shit
[2:46:34] <$cureneckbeard> git gud
[2:46:39] <Louie_Salmon> Yes...?
[2:46:40] <lloyddboy> it's 3D now
[2:46:40] <%Comradeiota> so you must be small, for many projectiles
[2:46:41] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[2:46:43] <talfurt> Hopefully it won’t have that camera bob that the first one had I had to find a mod that removed it so I wouldn’t feel sick
[2:46:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> Pretty much
[2:46:45] <Mr_Strut> You move and shoot
[2:46:47] <+linSP> it DID
[2:46:49] <GoldeNOVA> Risk of Rain looks fucking awesome, are you insane?
[2:46:49] <Mr_Strut> YES
[2:46:49] <%spiritofmojave> Risk of Rain is ok but there are better roguelikes out there now sugoiBestgirl
[2:46:49] <Skaw_Lann> yeah
[2:46:51] <%connos_livereview> @PlainSimpleTailor yes but alot of them are decent so its ok
[2:46:54] <reonome> ITS FUCKING 3D NOW ya goon
[2:46:55] <%JJCheeker> It's probably not meant to be played on the giant TV
[2:46:55] <CptBritches> Did Xenogears suck yours?
[2:46:55] <leole11> @AngriestPat there's a setting, scaling it is called, it makes you not tiny as fuck
[2:46:57] <extradopeness> Yeah i bounced off Risk of Rain hard
[2:46:57] <troxcree> It's a really fun game once you get the hang of it, and RoR 2 just hit early access.
[2:46:58] <Skaw_Lann> risk of rain sucked the dick so good
[2:46:59] <%Niney_Who> Pat it just sounds like the scale was perfect for you, being 3 pixels tall and all
[2:47:00] <alrobot2014> i mean if a game sucked my dick i'ld love it
[2:47:01] <foreverN2dust> Risk of Rain has the good succ
[2:47:01] <rosemon5001> maybe he bothered to learn how to play it
[2:47:02] <Louie_Salmon> It did and I loved the succ
[2:47:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat no you’re having a wrong opinion please stop Kappa
[2:47:03] <%El_Desperad0> It isn't as good as everyone think it is
[2:47:03] <$Piemono> Has Pat ever talked about STALKER before?
[2:47:11] <%ThePuddingDead> He KNOWS about spells right?
[2:47:12] <DevilDeus13> Risk of Rain 2 isnt a sidescoller pixel game tho
[2:47:12] <dirtyswampman> risk of rain gets dumbhard when you play with other people
[2:47:12] <$cureneckbeard> Risk of Rain is fine except you have time limits because the monsters get harder the longer you wait, but you also have to pick up all the things on the level to get strong enough to fight later levels at all
[2:47:16] <+Grayhammatter> missed two secrets
[2:47:17] <Psyramics> just missed the secret

[2:49:33] <%Laecerelius> "I'M THE BEST! OH NOOOOOOO!!!" - @AngriestPat
[2:49:33] <%spiritofmojave> Fuck you Moobot
[2:49:35] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Whatthe
[2:49:35] <+aslfrasle> Smooth chat, laugh derisively at him!
[2:49:36] <dirtyswampman> tales of maj'eyal is a great old school roguelike too
[2:49:37] <%ShaneWhite> That was some amazing skills there Pat
[2:49:37] <%ThePuddingDead> She talks, crazy talk crazy talk!
[2:49:42] <%averyoddjew> apatCrazy keeps getting stronger
[2:49:48] <rosemon5001> you dont have a chance to be.... @AngriestPat
[2:49:50] <DraxTD> so @AngriestPat , when [Crazy Talk] Activates... what sound effect do YOU here?
[2:49:51] <$Bt_Robot> There is no chance. To survive, make your time.
[2:49:52] <Darren716> You were saying about BoI?
[2:49:54] <%lewdskeletor13> Laugh at the ginger, laugh at him!
[2:49:54] <+Sxy_T_Rex> @AngriestPat You may dig Risk of Rain 2 then since it's a 3rd person shooter
[2:49:57] <%segonian> STAND ACTIVATE!
[2:50:19] <%cvp5127> finish your thot
[2:50:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> Loved this part of hollow knight
[2:50:25] <deafmutelaughing> Risk of Rain 2: This Time, It's Riskier
[2:50:26] <Louie_Salmon> @numbertoobig Dead cells is a fair counterpoint, nuclear throne is fun but kinda jank, Into the Breach has so little variation between runs compared to FTL that it got stale sooner
[2:50:31] <Skaw_Lann> crazy talk is the gun that kills the past
[2:50:44] <b_ikki> look at his fingers
[2:50:49] <%PlainSimpleTailor> He's got furnaces for KNEES
[2:50:51] <shinichizio> No fancy jumping on the sword tricks here, just get up and womp him with a shovel
[2:50:58] <MissMalisin> monkaS
[2:51:02] <+ShiningRaptor> ngl, I also thought that was a pit when I played LUL
[2:51:05] <+Bad1uck> Energy Falcon pines for freedom
[2:51:10] <%brickwall35> just pull up a wiki
[2:51:10] <MissMalisin> LUL
[2:51:14] <aimlesshealer> There is a lot in Isaac, true...
[2:51:21] <Darren716> The Synergies is what makes Isaac great
[2:51:22] <GoldeNOVA> That's the best part
[2:51:23] <Mr_Strut> You're not wrong
[2:51:24] <%AbnormalVoid> Isaac is just fucking luck
[2:51:25] <%Laecerelius> Yeah the items can be a bit much to try and remember
[2:51:27] <%brickwall35> that's the best part
[2:51:27] <%TheGreatBamBe> Yea and its CAREER SUICIDE to play Isaac
[2:51:28] <+JustSayAnything> Theres a good mod that tells you what everything does.
[2:51:28] <Darren716> You can OP as fuck in that game
[2:51:29] <+YabbaTroll> dont do that
[2:51:32] <%AbnormalVoid> you'll win most runs on a fluke
[2:51:32] <%ElenaManetta> Thats why the Gungeon book is better
[2:51:33] <burgerdicks> have you checked out Wizard of Legend?
[2:51:34] <%Ne1son> Just play it every day for years PAt
[2:51:36] <+YabbaTroll> lionNice lionNice lionNice lionNice
[2:51:37] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I love Isaac, but I really can't play without a cheatsheet to see what items do
[2:51:37] <+Huderga> but you play monster hunter in the old days
[2:51:39] <%Laecerelius> I think there's a mod that will tell you an item's stats
[2:51:40] <shinichizio> "Ah yes this gun is a shooter of bullets, got it"
[2:51:40] <soraabora> but pat the randomness is what makes it fun
[2:51:44] <GoldeNOVA> But most guns in Gungeon suck
[2:51:44] <+JavaManJoJo> @TheGreatBamBe lionEgg
[2:51:47] <+reiface08> what about dead cells
[2:51:47] <%waifoong98> Just install the wiki into your brain Kappa
[2:51:48] <%spiritofmojave> Isaac is apatBig on RNG, Gungeon runs are easily possible without it for the most part
[2:51:48] <Seitine> C A R E E R SUICIDE eggdaddy.
[2:51:50] <aimlesshealer> I just have all the Isaac items memorized because I've been playing it for a billion years LUL
[2:51:52] <$Piemono> Most items in Gungeon also don't outright fuck you
[2:51:52] <Louie_Salmon> Just know all the items after playing the game for thousands of hours, easy
[2:51:53] <%mercado94> i get it. i still preffer isacc
[2:51:55] <Sitromxe> I don't think you're supposed to wiki every item. The point is you have to figure it out.
[2:51:55] <DraxTD> you didn't win!
[2:51:55] <Mr_Strut> There ARE mods for Isaac that provide better item descriptions.
[2:51:56] <Ion_Laser> LUL LUL LUL
[2:51:57] <extradopeness> Yeah the Wiki HAS to be on hand for Isaac
[2:51:57] <rufus2k2> it's too easy to break isaac
[2:52:00] <DavidSanChan> you got moms toe cheese, th-thanks
[2:52:04] <%segonian> play Sonic Adventure 2. No reason just do it.
[2:52:05] <foreverN2dust> Risk of Rain has online multiplayer, which sets it apart the others.
[2:52:06] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@brickwall35) (warning)
[2:52:09] <%deviljhojho94> Just memorize them bro 4Head LOOOL
[2:52:10] <$cureneckbeard> Pat how about FTL?
[2:52:11] <%TheGreatBamBe> boomers in the chat i thank you for the memes
[2:52:12] <Darren716> Im gonna play Isaac now out of spite pat
[2:52:13] <+linSP> but arent the descriptions FUNNY
[2:52:13] <VinyMars> There's a mod for that
[2:52:14] <rufus2k2> gungeon even with everything unlocked still demands skill
[2:52:17] <+Grayhammatter> but what it do?
[2:52:21] <%ThePuddingDead> but it's a GUN pat
[2:52:23] <SixthSun2> Fortunately, there are mods that fix that problem with Isaac
[2:52:25] <+TastySammiches> there's a good mod for isaac that tells you what shit do
[2:52:25] <Kaneis> Isaac to me feels like a simulation of item combinations, Gungeon has a lot more 'game' to me
[2:52:26] <%ThePuddingDead> what's it do tho?
[2:52:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> Rolling around at the speed of SOUND!
[2:52:27] <%El_Desperad0> Same
[2:52:28] <+buttdirt> you got cancer ehhhhh you do more damage now
[2:52:29] <soraabora> thats fair
[2:52:32] <%ThePuddingDead> IT'S A GUN PAT
[2:52:34] <extradopeness> Its A GUN man
[2:52:36] <%waifoong98> Nuclear throne stream when Kappa
[2:52:42] <%Kirby_Sauce> got places to go got to follow my rainbow!
[2:52:42] <%ElenaManetta> After shooting in Gungeon for hours, switching back to Issac, the default tears fucking suck
[2:52:43] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat thats literally the wrong way the reason why we have been playing it soo long is because the random runs (also there is an extra hub you can activate tat shows the stat effects it has)
[2:52:44] <%ace_cfa44> seeing pat do FTL sometime would be cool
[2:52:45] <+TheoTTree> It's a G U N
[2:52:50] <Zebroneath> Yeah, Isaac has the poor habit of probably screwing you over with a bad synergy if you don't know beforehand.
[2:52:53] <%SrG00SE> nuclear throne is good but man did gungeon fucking eat that games lunch
[2:52:58] <GoldeNOVA> Bad taste
[2:53:02] <+linSP> hot take, gungeon feels too casual
[2:53:03] <%El_Desperad0> @AngriestPat you know Gungeon is getting it's last update next month?
[2:53:04] <+Grayhammatter> crazy talk
[2:53:04] <caol2017> Reverse crazy talk
[2:53:04] <pillowwasp> Pat you aren’t meant to question Issacs game design. Just trust it blindly
[2:53:13] <b_ikki> weaponized crazy talk
[2:53:14] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah I feel bad for Nuclear Throne in that respect, was some good shit at the time @SrG00SE
[2:53:20] <+TastySammiches> @linSP what are you talking about, gungeon's not casual at all
[2:53:25] <+TastySammiches> it's a bullet hell
[2:53:29] <VanLynx> Pat can you elaborate they all feel like video games to me
[2:53:33] <%ElenaManetta> The good thing about Isaac that Gungeon doesn't have is that you're able to actually become overpowered
[2:53:34] <soraabora> you find out!
[2:53:34] <Darren716> Just learn
[2:53:35] <%brickwall35> just have a wiki pulled up Pat
[2:53:46] <extradopeness> Yeah how dare you have an opinion
[2:53:48] <SixthSun2> There are thankfully mods that tell you what items do @AngriestPat
[2:53:48] <+ArcLifth> gungeon has that too though
[2:53:49] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Should I try Gungeon if I enjoyed Nuclear Throne?
[2:53:53] <GoldeNOVA> Just play, don't bother about what the items do, you learn eventually
[2:53:54] <Skaw_Lann> no pat dont you get it, they like it so youre wrong
[2:53:55] <$cureneckbeard> Just have Paige reading out the wiki
[2:53:57] <%waifoong98> but you did it for warframe Kappa
[2:53:58] <b_ikki> just play the game with a wiki thats fun 4Head
[2:53:58] <StaticSunrise> you shouldn't need to have a wiki open to just play the fucking game normally
[2:53:59] <+YabbaTroll> you play warframe tho
[2:54:00] <%ElenaManetta> That does suck
[2:54:00] <%ThePuddingDead> i can understand that if your referencing the side items on the corners of the screen, you need a wiki to understand that facet, I'll give u that @AngriestPat
[2:54:01] <%connos_livereview> hes right
[2:54:01] <+TastySammiches> you can become an overpowered gun god in gungeon but the game does a good job of preventing it
[2:54:02] <dirtyswampman> it really doesnt help that there are items like pills in isaac that are basically random
[2:54:04] <%El_Desperad0> @ElenaManetta you don't play enough gungeon
[2:54:06] <%brickwall35> I love it tho
[2:54:07] <%VanaSkiller> OG Monster Hunters
[2:54:08] <GoldeNOVA> MONSTER HUNTER
[2:54:08] <Cranky_Construct> Its tedious
[2:54:08] <+JustSayAnything> Dont you need a wiki for warframe?
[2:54:08] <Darren716> Also there really arent too many to learn that are important
[2:54:08] <Miikaaeeel> Warframe?
[2:54:09] <%VanaSkiller> LUL
[2:54:09] <%deviljhojho94> Just dont play the game 4Head
[2:54:09] <foreverN2dust> Why can't it just be in game? Is that asking too much?
[2:54:09] <Crankthulhu> @AngriestPat you play WARFRAME PAT
[2:54:10] <CaptainFrankincense> you pulled a wiki up for sekiro?
[2:54:12] <+valkuma> ISAAC FANS cant handle the fact that isaac is OLD and BAD
[2:54:12] <%mercado94> LUL
[2:54:12] <%nmaten> how about warframe?? or any mmo ever
[2:54:13] <Skaw_Lann> just memorize over a thousand pages of info
[2:54:13] <%spiritofmojave> Warframe LUL
[2:54:14] <+TastySammiches> That's the worst thing about Warframe, too
[2:54:15] <reiju_22> Kappa
[2:54:18] <soraabora> you just learn it, you look at an item and go owo whats this and you find out somehow
[2:54:20] <%daisyyyy> Hzving to pause and look up every item is taxing
[2:54:24] <rosemon5001> most of the time it pops a tiny text like shot speed up dmg up and such @AngriestPat
[2:54:26] <ZComiX> Would you play it if there was a mod that showed you what each item did before you picked it up @AngriestPat ?
[2:54:26] <%waifoong98> what are u talking about, I didn't need a wiki for monhun LUL
[2:54:27] <%ElenaManetta> Gungeon you can become strong, but you don't become overpowered in the same sense as Isaac where you gain abilities to destroy the environment or just touch destroy enemies
[2:54:34] <%SrG00SE> @TheSpiritof2277 yeah the timing on both games releases put them against eachother hard.
[2:54:36] <+Huderga> you don't really need a wiki in warframe guys
[2:54:38] <Nina96> I asked miiverse
[2:54:40] <soraabora> but that is part of the fun for me, the randomness
[2:54:42] <%nmaten> any fighting game
[2:54:50] <deafmutelaughing> Pat use the dust knuckles here
[2:54:53] <%mercado94> Oh boy here we go
[2:54:55] <Pnutz_> Warframe actually has a lot the info in game, but its just easier to look up a wiki
[2:54:56] <soraabora> I also have like 1000+ hours on it lmao
[2:54:57] <extradopeness> Oh god chat so PJSalt
[2:54:59] <On_Target> guys, if he doesn't like it he doesn't like it. there's a jillion other games out there
[2:55:00] <%ThePuddingDead> i always see this guy and think he's wearing those sippy cup holder hats, am I crazy? @AngriestPat
[2:55:01] <Caidezes> The Warframe devs are actively looking into fixing the wiki problem.
[2:55:04] <$Brother_Coduss> I like TearofGrace's idea of doing runs where he TRIES to get stupid, broken runs
[2:55:05] <+ChaosVulpes> Is Dust Knuckle a pun on Knuckle Duster?
[2:55:07] <%SrG00SE> i love isaac and pats not wrong
[2:55:07] <VinyMars> There's a mod in Isaac that gives items desciptions before you get them
[2:55:07] <worldbrand> after a certain point, you will DEFINITELY want the wiki for warframe
[2:55:08] <Nitsuj293> there have been like 5 expansions at this point
[2:55:10] <%waifoong98> @Caidezes by making it worse LUL
[2:55:12] <Louie_Salmon> Yes, exactly
[2:55:21] <+TastySammiches> and then you get to afterbirth+ and you stop because it's bad
[2:55:22] <RevenTheLight> Hey, so what was that about Stalker 2? Was it confirmed or something? I can't find anything
[2:55:23] <+YabbaTroll> i can get that
[2:55:23] <+JustSayAnything> But items unlock as they go.
[2:55:24] <%ElenaManetta> Gungeon does it 100% correct where it has its own in-game encyclopedia where item info only unlocks once you get it. It shouldn't be hard to implement that into a game.
[2:55:25] <Nero9341> @waifoong98 for world you don't, but the earlier ones you definitely need a wiki
[2:55:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> WARFRAME
[2:55:27] <aimlesshealer> I stopped at afterbirth, honestly
[2:55:27] <MissMalisin> Isaac <3
[2:55:28] <%brickwall35> Pat I perfect'd Afterbirth+, you never truly learn everything. But I don't mind having a wiki open.
[2:55:29] <PerrinIsDead> Hey @angriestpat you gonna check out Path of Exile since it just dropped on PS4?
[2:55:30] <Caidezes> @waifoong98 Oh you~~
[2:55:35] <grayjammer> "Where do get weapon/warframe blueprints?"
[2:55:35] <b_ikki> just learn 1000 items 4Head
[2:55:38] <+linSP> but what about a game like dota that had like 100 characters with their own kits right from the beta
[2:55:43] <Louie_Salmon> 100 hours is nothing
[2:55:45] <+TastySammiches> @angriestpat don't play afterbirth+, start with rebirth
[2:55:45] <DaHaLoJeDi> Shovel Knight wiggly body
[2:55:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> Describing WARFRAME
[2:55:47] <DevilDeus13> Why caat it just be an option to have item descriptions when you come across them
[2:55:48] <Darren716> Pat i literally jumped from vanilla to Afterbirth+ on the switch, it was fine
[2:55:51] <%SrG00SE> its compounded to so much content that you have to take breaks from gameplay too often to figure out whats going on, and you might not see that item again for weeks
[2:55:52] <$FuriousJohn87> cheer100 Have a good evening Pat, sorry I can't stay longer.
[2:55:54] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Whatthe
[2:55:57] <deafmutelaughing> YYEEAAAH
[2:56:03] <+Huderga> you guys are really missing the point of what he's saying
[2:56:10] <GoldeNOVA> That's the best part though!
[2:56:14] <%mercado94> Maybe you'll learn if you play it for 200 hours Kappa
[2:56:15] <SuperOffensiveStudios> if you have to go outside the game to learn what things are doing. thats bad game design... its the entire reason things like tooltips exist
[2:56:16] <Seitine> And it's like why learn it for a game that old and you have little to no interest in playing.
[2:56:16] <extradopeness> Afterbith suuuucked
[2:56:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The difference is in Warframe you never die and you do your learning by shooting things in the face
[2:56:26] <dezik45> Shovel Knight confirmed punch girl.
[2:56:26] <Dio_TR> @elenamanetta the fans of Isaac are nuts, if you explain straight up what a thing does they get upset for some reason
[2:56:27] <%connos_livereview> you dont die in a few hits in warframe usually
[2:56:30] <+TastySammiches> afterbirth+ is pretty bad
[2:56:30] <Louie_Salmon> And the fact that 100 hours is nothing is definitely bullshit and unfair, but that's just how it is
[2:56:31] <Nina96> @AngriestPat the game explains badly is what u mean right?
[2:56:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> favorite song in this game, in this game of AMAZING MUSIC
[2:56:32] <%El_Desperad0> @Huderga it's usual with this chat
[2:56:33] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I liked Afterbirth tho :)
[2:56:36] <%JJCheeker> I'm gonna head out have a good night everyone apatWink /
[2:56:37] <Caidezes> Warframe has a lot of info in the game itself. It's just not shown up front of told to the player well.
[2:56:38] <SixthSun2> As an avid player of Isaac, I do admit, that is a big problem. There are fortunately mods that tell you what items do when you get them, but it definitely should be a thing in the base game. @AngriestPat
[2:56:39] <pectusumbra> another reason why I prefer terraria over minecraft
[2:56:45] <aimlesshealer> I guess you either like that or you don't, that's fine
[2:56:45] <%spiritofmojave> to be real, some games which you have to wiki shit can be rewarding if you're completely unaware of how good something is--but most the time it's just a waste of your time/takes you out of the game
[2:56:53] <extradopeness> Yup best theme right here
[2:56:53] <%waifoong98> you could have just said that Kappa
[2:56:57] <+Huderga> @Plague_Nurse oof
[2:57:01] <lucianon96plays> Same here pat, i hate the shooting in isaac
[2:57:04] <+valkuma> the actual gameplay in isaac is actual garbage
[2:57:05] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@RipSlamsteak) (warning)
[2:57:15] <StaticSunrise> that shouldn't need to be a mod though
[2:57:18] <%Niney_Who> I can definitely do that.
[2:57:18] <%El_Desperad0> You can contact Hutts
[2:57:19] <+ArcLifth> Thats why Eluc made platinum god
[2:57:20] <%SrG00SE> Pat being so fair
[2:57:20] <%ElenaManetta> I LOVE that items stack in Isaac, it's what made me buy it. But sometimes you can go like, three fucking floors and get nothing and just have an awful run. At least Gungeon, you're nearly guaranteed one at least OK thing per floor.
[2:57:20] <worldbrand> he's got a pretty good point here. warframe's information that it hides from you is seldom essential to understanding how a thing works, it's just a thousand different mechanics and hidden intricacies
[2:57:23] <extradopeness> That still sucks
[2:57:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> Just go to the steam workshop
[2:57:32] <%ThePuddingDead> to each his own, i can see it's strengths as well as its weaknesses, i end up playin isaac once in a blue moon to scratch that random shooter itch yknow?
[2:57:32] <+linSP> get all the NECESSARY mods
[2:57:33] <+TastySammiches> @angriestpat play either rebirth or afterbirth, SKIP afterbirth+
[2:57:34] <+HeadsHeldHigh> There is a Josuke mod for Binding of Isaac
[2:57:34] <%SrG00SE> look at this big fair ginger
[2:57:38] <%MegboyManuel> Enter the Gungeon final update next month though dude!!!!!
[2:57:38] <$Bt_Robot> Issac Afterbirth: In Sleep
[2:57:40] <+gutlesscoward> shovel knight afterbirth +
[2:57:40] <aimlesshealer> @TastySammiches agreed
[2:57:40] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I will agree... Thee gameplay of Issa fels really bad...
[2:57:44] <DevilDeus13> Mega Birth
[2:57:44] <dirtyswampman> youre gonna want one that has everything unlocked too, super tedious to get the good ones
[2:57:46] <+vinnysuperg123> @AngriestPat Afterbirth+ sucks.
[2:57:46] <TikanZK> i dont even care about issac but I can really appreciate pat's open mindedness here
[2:57:49] <Louie_Salmon> AntiBirth is rad
[2:57:52] <%kknutson4> The only other game that has so many broken item synergies is Slay the Spire
[2:57:54] <%cvp5127> isaac: birth by sleep
[2:57:55] <b_ikki> it does
[2:57:55] <%MegboyManuel> Big Gungeon update April!
[2:57:56] <+vinnysuperg123> I made a video on how bad aftebirth+ is lol
[2:57:59] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Yeah it does
[2:58:00] <%ElenaManetta> Default shooting in Isaac feels terrible.
[2:58:01] <%nmaten> no one likes afterbirth+
[2:58:02] <+linSP> afterbirth+ made the game more ANNOYING
[2:58:04] <%ThePuddingDead> all I got was Wrath of the Lamb @AngriestPat is that one ok still?
[2:58:04] <Nina96> how many versions of issac is thier?
[2:58:05] <MissMalisin> It's not great
[2:58:06] <deafmutelaughing> After Night In Birth: Late EXE [St]
[2:58:07] <+TastySammiches> afterbirth+ sucks unless you're super hardcore and you've already beaten afterbirth
[2:58:08] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat This is a bit off topic, but will you be returning to Subnautica or nah?
[2:58:09] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Dead Cells used to have a ton of just straight fucked synergies
[2:58:10] <CaptainFrankincense> most people like the random stuff and figuring it out pat is just saying he doesnt like that
[2:58:10] <emeraldskrull> anyone else want to see pat on the ground on his back trying to get up without any assistance?
[2:58:14] <%ElenaManetta> Especially when so many enemies do fast diagonal movements
[2:58:16] <extradopeness> Its awful truly
[2:58:17] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I don't think it's bad, honestly, but that's just my personal taste
[2:58:21] <SixthSun2> The little free expansion packs are nice, but Afterbirth + isn't very substantial, especially compared to the fan made expansion ANTIbirth
[2:58:23] <$cureneckbeard> Pat how about FTL? It's a Roguelike but you don't need a wiki pulled up
[2:58:29] <%mercado94> The Binding of isaac: RE:Chain of the Birth by Dream Memories/358 Sleep Distance Final Mix HD Remake/2 Days
[2:58:38] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> but also its salvation
[2:58:39] <+TastySammiches> the exact same thing ruins warframe for me
[2:58:39] <Skaw_Lann> binding of isaac dream drop distance 3.2 birth by sleep final abortion afterbirth+ rebirth
[2:58:41] <CptBritches> How much is too much content?
[2:58:42] <%ThePuddingDead> i got ya
[2:58:43] <%Agami23> they added bosses that scale to your DPS, which isnt fun
[2:58:46] <%MelBrooksKA> God I love this level's gimmick
[2:58:52] <%kknutson4> Do Isaac with the Antibirth modpack. Better fan-made expansion than Afterbirth
[2:58:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 Isaac has a good example of JoJo stand mods replaces tears with chargeable stand rush attacks. Risk of rain is great, sounds like you just had a scaling problem, but it's a great game in that dead cells vein of rouge-lites. I'd like to imagine I'm what the prospective child of pat and paige would be. Pat is the Cyclops to my Cable.
[2:59:05] <+TastySammiches> there's no such thing as too much content, but you have to backload it
[2:59:11] <%ElenaManetta> Greed mode is actually a lot more fun because it's all about item collecting to power up
[2:59:11] <%waifoong98> LUL
[2:59:12] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:59:13] <stabbityrabbit> The idea of crazy randomness, combinations, upgrades, and all that sounds great. Issue is that I'd want all that in a game that isn't as hard as Isaac. Like a party game, if that makes sense.
[2:59:13] <%ThePuddingDead> y
[2:59:13] <%mercado94> LUL
[2:59:14] <%brickwall35> why
[2:59:14] <gustavozxd> warriors orochi 3 ultimate is probably too much content

[2:59:30] <cham52> why didnt you take the jump pat
[2:59:30] <leole11> Gooeyfication
[2:59:30] <Dio_TR> I wish we could have RE 2 Remake with a rogue like more, maybe one day mods will do it
[2:59:30] <Intolerable> Just make the jump...
[2:59:30] <%waifoong98> @gustavozxd at least better than nothing like 4 PunOko
[2:59:31] <Louie_Salmon> @awsomesaucekirby I don't think it was a scaling problem, the RoR characters are just super small and the levels are super big and that's how it is
[2:59:33] <%ElenaManetta> Is the green goo gelatin
[2:59:34] <pillowwasp> Too much obfuscated content
[2:59:40] <extradopeness> Kirby that is uh real creepy
[2:59:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @daisyyyy the green one
[2:59:47] <CaptainFrankincense> risk of rain 2 is in early access now
[2:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:50] <$cureneckbeard> yeah Risk of Rain your guy is like 1cm high on the screen
[2:59:51] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat speaking of roguelikes, thinking of Slay the spire for some mutha fuckin card synergies
[2:59:51] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Hades won't be on there forever
[2:59:53] <%ThePuddingDead> agreed
[2:59:54] <Mrbaconator> hades is super cool
[2:59:55] <%Solidnick18> same
[2:59:55] <+Cybercobra2> same pat. binding of isaac, rogue legacy, etc etc
[2:59:56] <%epoladia> epoladia subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:59:57] <%PlainSimpleTailor> This song sounds like a 2000s dance club song
[2:59:58] <%MelBrooksKA> @daisyyyy the chemical of shutup tho
[2:59:58] <%cvp5127> just wait a year LUL
[2:59:58] <%Dr00_PhD> true
[2:59:58] <$cureneckbeard> roguelite is a stupid word.
[2:59:59] <%ThePuddingDead> ill wait
[2:59:59] <leole11> i agree
[3:00:00] <Nina96> it does
[3:00:03] <%Kirby_Sauce> @Louie_Salmon yeah but we can't tell pat that, he's manic about this shit
[3:00:03] <Pnutz_> Hopefully they'll keep there word and release it in a year
[3:00:03] <+TastySammiches> thank you, Stay_Hydrated_Bot
[3:00:03] <%nmaten> how about fucking outer worlds
[3:00:03] <gustavozxd> @waifoong98 I only heard the OST didn't even look at any gameplay videos, so my experience with it is fairly positive LUL
[3:00:05] <leole11> hopefully epic changes or dies
[3:00:06] <Louie_Salmon> Hades is good, the epic store is fine
[3:00:06] <lucianon96plays> Cause it's the epic store.
[3:00:06] <%MegboyManuel> Why the hate for the Epic Store???
[3:00:06] <worldbrand> I have that exact problem with Hades and I own and adore the rest of supergiant's library
[3:00:07] <+SimplyPandaz> Daily reminder that Epic and tencent are SHIT
[3:00:07] <%spiritofmojave> I'm still upset about Outer Worlds and that shit
[3:00:10] <StaticSunrise> I don't feel safe giving the epic store my credit card info
[3:00:15] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah
[3:00:15] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat its not done yet so no rush cirTan
[3:00:23] <%Solidnick18> yep
[3:00:23] <%daisyyyy> I wanna play tye new toejam and earl game
[3:00:25] <%MegboyManuel> Whats wrong with the Epic Store?
[3:00:27] <leole11> @MegboyManuel scummy business tactics that are anticonsumer
[3:00:27] <Seitine> Give me all the stores. Steam can go fuck itself.
[3:00:28] <Skaw_Lann> look, risk of rain knows when to put the finger in
[3:00:29] <Nitsuj293> Honestly adding more stuff to Issac at this point just makes it aaaaaaaful because they keep adding items that are a determent when obtained
[3:00:29] <WeebFever> "Isaac really turned me on" - Pat
[3:00:30] <CaptainFrankincense> epic store is the chinese spyware one
[3:00:30] <%PalmtopNami> what is the issue for the epic store?
[3:00:30] <+TastySammiches> @MegboyManuel they're strongarming players by buying up as many exclusives as they can and also their launcher sucks
[3:00:31] <%deviljhojho94> epic store fucked over my outer worlds tomatoPain
[3:00:35] <%nmaten> rouge legacy is the shit youre right pat
[3:00:38] <Skaw_Lann> rogue legacy IS the shit
[3:00:39] <%SaltyDongs> Issac turns you on?
[3:00:39] <%SrG00SE> rogue legacy is a game i somehow own 3 copies of and have never played
[3:00:40] <%Solidnick18> shady stuff
[3:00:44] <axelcezar> rogue legacy is one of the best godamn shit out there
[3:00:45] <%ShovelJustice21> first try
[3:00:49] <lucianon96plays> I can't believe Outer Worlds is an Epic Store exclusive for the time being.
[3:00:49] <CaptainFrankincense> rogue legacy has a couple dumb mechanics
[3:00:50] <%MelBrooksKA> I should play rouge legacy
[3:00:50] <%GarbageNirvana> It's funny because Rogue Legacy never really clicked with me and I'm usually all about them roguey-likes
[3:00:51] <$D4C_Trice> don't need some store to start looking up my data and snitch on me to Epic and China
[3:00:52] <%Kirby_Sauce> people are complaining borderlands 3 might be an epic games exclusive? and I'm like: console
[3:00:52] <%waifoong98> @gustavozxd "hey I heard you guys like Orochi 3, how bout we remove all the GUEST characters"
[3:00:54] <%MegboyManuel> Ahhhh right Launcher issues with the data stuff
[3:00:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Apparently there is a guy on twitter at Pax asking people to send names out for Influencers that would want to work with them on Borderlands 3.
[3:00:57] <%ElenaManetta> You said it in the Gungeon Best Friends LP, but I like Gungeon more because "It's fun right away", whereas Issac doesn't get fun until after you get some good items
[3:00:58] <SpookyBeef7> I think I had Rogue Legacy as the same exposure to Roguelikes. Don't Starve also was pretty high up there.
[3:01:01] <NumberTooBig> Epic store is a bad store that buys initial exclusivity, complete with spyware
[3:01:04] <%epoladia> Just did a apatBig twitchprime sub y'all
[3:01:10] <Calek> Slay the Spire is a lot of fun
[3:01:10] <%Toynota10> Dead Cells?
[3:01:13] <Dio_TR> Like it isn't Xenophobia but a genuine concert that the Chinese companies collect your data without consent
[3:01:14] <+superkeaton> LUL
[3:01:14] <%kknutson4> Death Road to Canada is a pretty cool roguelike
[3:01:16] <rosemon5001> i guess thats why you also couldnt get into risk of rain other than the art(wich really doesnt translate well to big screens) because risk of rains complexity whit its items is almost identical
[3:01:16] <%salty_syd913> LUL
[3:01:17] <deafmutelaughing> classic mistake
[3:01:17] <SixthSun2> LUL
[3:01:17] <+Grayhammatter> welp

[3:01:19] <%Agami23> did you ever try wizard of legend? @AngriestPat
[3:01:20] <%connos_livereview> i love FTL
[3:01:21] <gustavozxd> @waifoong98 oh that's lame, they were the coolest
[3:01:22] <%BestTeaMaker> try wizard of legend

[3:01:27] <Pnutz_> LUL
[3:01:27] <%nmaten> FTL is a fantastic game

[3:01:28] <InfraRedRidingHood_> atpRtsd
[3:01:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> PLAY FTL
[3:01:32] <%Teintstein> sup doods
[3:01:32] <%spiritofmojave> FTL is probably the comfiest game for me
[3:01:33] <Louie_Salmon> FTL is indeed amazing
[3:01:33] <+TastySammiches> @AngriestPat Rogue Legacy is pretty good, but have you played that studio's true masterpiece "Don't Shit Your Pants"?
[3:01:33] <CaptainFrankincense> thats fair
[3:01:33] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:01:34] <gustavozxd> that makes sense
[3:01:38] <Louie_Salmon> oh boy
[3:01:39] <%Dr00_PhD> Necodancer?
[3:01:40] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> FTL is the best Star Trek game @AngriestPat
[3:01:41] <DaHaLoJeDi> atpRtsd
[3:01:42] <%Nobrev> mad
[3:01:43] <+Cybercobra2> im still waiting for the day we get a dark souls style roguelite @AngriestPat
[3:01:43] <+ArcLifth> is it the goblins?
[3:01:43] <%ThePuddingDead> the random nature coupled with really quick updates makes it much easier to deal with
[3:01:45] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat new dead cells update just right now lol
[3:01:45] <reiju_22> I prefer hollow knight
[3:01:46] <deafmutelaughing> so like how I feel about bastion
[3:01:48] <%MegboyManuel> I feel like the exclusivity thing is a necessary evil to compete with steam though?
[3:01:48] <SixthSun2> @AngriestPat Have you tried out A Robot Named Fight?
[3:01:48] <%daisyyyy> You ever play toejam and earl pat?
[3:01:50] <%spiritofmojave> damn
[3:01:51] <%Solidnick18> what do you mean
[3:01:54] <reonome> pat what is wrong with you
[3:01:55] <Louie_Salmon> the gobolins do it
[3:01:56] <NumberTooBig> @TastySammiches they've mentioned it in early podcasts
[3:01:56] <%PlainSimpleTailor> How is it Your fault for having preferences?
[3:01:57] <%connos_livereview> HOW do you feel about into the breach @AngriestPat
[3:01:58] <+Marnex> Do you like The Messenger?
[3:02:01] <%mercado94> just remember: life is just a temporary buff
[3:02:01] <%SrG00SE> FTL is the only roguelite ive played from release up until this day
[3:02:02] <foreverN2dust> The giant swords are ASS
[3:02:04] <%ThePuddingDead> thats why I prefer Divinity 2: Original Sin and Darkest Dungeon than I do XCOM 2
[3:02:05] <lucianon96plays> I mean, it's good that Steam has competition, but Jesus fuck, Epic is just so shit with their store.
[3:02:05] <$TheCrispyBoi> ?
[3:02:06] <extradopeness> Same tbh
[3:02:10] <Timesteel> @angriestpat what about spelunky

[3:02:22] <$Bt_Robot> tee hee
[3:02:23] <reonome> that what you get talking shit about dead cells
[3:02:25] <$cureneckbeard> Pat play NetHack, you just need to have the wiki open at all times
[3:02:27] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Good jorb.
[3:02:27] <$D4C_Trice> get good at jumping Pat
[3:02:28] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Man, I don't think I've ever beat the final boss of FTL

[3:02:34] <Nero9341> @AngriestPat have you ever tried wizard of legend?
[3:02:35] <Mrbaconator> necrodancer?
[3:02:39] <beltedham> shovel knight is now a rogue like for pat
[3:02:40] <%ShaneWhite> 1 to 100 just like that
[3:02:41] <axelcezar> Caveblazers from the brits Yogscast?
[3:02:41] <%XzileGaming> im amazing at isaac
[3:02:43] <lucianon96plays> Why make shit exclusive on Epic? why not add exclusive content instead of the actual game being exclusive?
[3:02:44] <b_ikki> necrodancer is good shit
[3:02:46] <extradopeness> spelunky was great
[3:02:46] <%waifoong98> you want Wiki the game? Play Elona LUL
[3:02:50] <Youwereeatenbyalid> OOF
[3:02:50] <%MegboyManuel> right, i heard Epic doesnt even have a Cart
[3:02:52] <+CharredChord> Metroid rouge like
[3:02:54] <worldbrand> Is that the game with the megabeast or whatever?
[3:02:54] <Dio_TR> @mrbaconator Pat has no rhythm!
[3:02:54] <%MagickBurritoh> you guys did a video on it
[3:02:54] <%SrG00SE> I think I've heard Pat's opinion on FTL in the Into the Breach lp but can't remember
[3:02:59] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @AngriestPat Super Metroid but rogulike
[3:03:00] <Youwereeatenbyalid> DIDN'T YOU GUYS PLAY it?
[3:03:00] <%ThePuddingDead> it doesnt have a cart, no
[3:03:01] <%Solidnick18> i'll try necrodancer out on my switch
[3:03:01] <caol2017> didn't you play that on the channel
[3:03:02] <%Toynota10> Matt and Woolie did a video on A robot named fight
[3:03:03] <%kknutson4> Metroid roguelike
[3:03:04] <SixthSun2> Rogue lite Metroid clone
[3:03:05] <Seitine> Why makes shit exclusive on the PS4 or Xbox? Same reason.
[3:03:06] <Louie_Salmon> Spelunky is another amazing one, just in a whole other genre with it's own hundred hour+ learning curve
[3:03:08] <Cranky_Construct> Heart&Slash would've been a really fun roguelite if it didn't drop the ball so hard after the first stage
[3:03:08] <%GarbageNirvana> It' was that extremely Metroid game
[3:03:10] <Pnutz_> I tried necrodancer, but I'm horrible at it, maybe someday ill try to git gud
[3:03:20] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat but will you try out risk of rain 2 since its 3d now?
[3:03:22] <%Nobrev> no?
[3:03:22] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Have you heard of Wizard of Legend?
[3:03:25] <%salty_syd913> kinda
[3:03:25] <gustavozxd> is Hades gonna be exclusive on epic forever? cause man I want that game but eugh epic store, also early access ResidentSleeper
[3:03:25] <b_ikki> not really
[3:03:26] <%MegboyManuel> just from a dev perspective, Epic seems good???(?)
[3:03:27] <$TheCrispyBoi> no
[3:03:28] <+TastySammiches> it works ok on a controller
[3:03:28] <%spiritofmojave> Controller is fine for me?
[3:03:29] <Timesteel> dance pad
[3:03:30] <caol2017> The only way to play is with a DDR pad
[3:03:30] <%salty_syd913> for me
[3:03:31] <+Marnex> Do you like The Messenger?
[3:03:33] <%GarbageNirvana> It's got legit controller support now
[3:03:33] <$Bt_Robot> How did you enjoy Death's Gambit?
[3:03:34] <%Comradeiota> I played it with a controller @AngriestPat
[3:03:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> It works good on controller for me
[3:03:36] <b_ikki> i've played it with apd
[3:03:38] <b_ikki> pad
[3:03:38] <Kaneis> @Louie_Salmon I think once you figure out Spelunky it becomes real flow charty -- but getting to that point is a blast
[3:03:38] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Dear person who was in chat and told me about twitch prime giving a free year of nintendo online
[3:03:40] <Darren716> I mean its on switch and stuff
[3:03:41] <+Grayhammatter> dance pad obviously
[3:03:41] <%Comradeiota> And Cadence of Hyrule is coming on the switch
[3:03:45] <%SaltyDongs> that guys rad
[3:03:45] <shinichizio> My favorite roguelike is Steel Battalion MrDestructoid
[3:03:46] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat well its coming to the swtich so no cirTan
[3:03:46] <NumberTooBig> Dpad and keyboard, yes
[3:03:48] <%salty_syd913> i cant even really imagine playing it on a controler
[3:03:48] <%ElenaManetta> i need to shower but shovel knight
[3:03:49] <extradopeness> whats that one roguelike with the limb conditions? ADAM or something?
[3:03:51] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Thank you
[3:03:51] <worldbrand> If you have problems with mis-inputs with analog or dpad then i would just recommend a keyboard tbh
[3:04:00] <%ThePuddingDead> mhmm
[3:04:04] <%spiritofmojave> Cadence is gonna be a lot of fun, give me more Link's Awakening goodness and solid tracks
[3:04:04] <sukiyakiwestern> well they better figure it out for switch
[3:04:04] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[3:04:06] <b_ikki> i've played it with face buttons
[3:04:06] <%salty_syd913> its on the switch
[3:04:06] <stabbityrabbit> I absolutely love the idea of Necrodancer, but I'm complete ass at rhythm games.
[3:04:07] <NumberTooBig> the funky dpad on the switch will finally have a use
[3:04:08] <%Jetsfantasy> Play it with an electronic drum kit Kappa
[3:04:13] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, Necrodancer is coming to swtich with Zelda stuff
[3:04:15] <leole11> left
[3:04:15] <%Dr00_PhD> The Zelda thing Pat
[3:04:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> Necrodancer is on Switch already.
[3:04:17] <%MelBrooksKA> I've been thinking of getting Momodoro
[3:04:19] <Cranky_Construct> @extradopeness I think you mean ADOM? Idk if it has limb damage tho
[3:04:21] <%salty_syd913> yeah
[3:04:25] <+TastySammiches> you can rebind those to shoulder buttons
[3:04:28] <%Jetsfantasy> Map the midi inputs to directional inputs
[3:04:29] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat wizard of legend is a decent roguelike
[3:04:32] <%Taisuru> You can rebind those
[3:04:33] <SailingSaturn> I was slightly right cirDerp
[3:04:37] <extradopeness> Yeah ADOM
[3:04:37] <%waifoong98> when's Dwarf Fortress Stream Kappa
[3:04:40] <foreverN2dust> I would like to see it played with a DDR pag
[3:04:41] <sukiyakiwestern> no a zelda necrodancer is coming to switch its a brand new game
[3:04:43] <foreverN2dust> pad*
[3:04:45] <NumberTooBig> i guess its for those who use dancepads
[3:04:48] <ShichiNoBushi> Then you enter on different sides of the controller such as on the Switch it would be Up and B.
[3:04:50] <Cranky_Construct> UnReal World has limb damage and a lot of complex mechanics behind it, but it's more so like a roguelike survival game
[3:04:51] <Louie_Salmon> I guess you just bind those to triggers and shoulders
[3:04:52] <%epoladia> Should every game let you remap?
[3:04:53] <aimlesshealer> @waifoong98 I do believe that game would kill Pat
[3:04:53] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Yep but summer could bring a surprise if they're right
[3:04:54] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah?
[3:04:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> wijard

[3:23:00] <RealRocketShot> Man risk of rain looks a lot different
[3:23:12] <Kalcom> what about bloodstained
[3:23:17] <%waifoong98> Just throw 30k in Star Citizen, it will be safe I swear Kappa
[3:23:18] <+TastySammiches> buttstained
[3:23:23] <Nina96> @NumberTooBig thx'
[3:23:24] <%SaltyDongs> Is there a game you'd 24 hour?
[3:23:28] <%GarbageNirvana> What if Capcom let you make a Resident Evil
[3:23:31] <$waltzqueen> the ghost was inside you all along pat
[3:23:32] <pwnhills> One on the right, you missed a ghost
[3:23:33] <rosemon5001> secret spooky ghost
[3:23:33] <Kalcom> oh not you you
[3:23:34] <%nicoleymcquack> alr
[3:23:36] <+天使42199> I hoped bloodstained will be good
[3:23:37] <%XzileGaming> might number 9
[3:23:40] <Kalcom> it was the channel
[3:23:50] <xvalltana> did mighty no. 9 bitter the experience for you? or just lack of interest in other projects?
[3:23:53] <KatabolicRage> man I'm excited for bloodlines tommorow, outta curiousity does he have a mouse and keyboard setup for that couch? I remmember him talking about lapboards once and how they're garbage or something
[3:23:54] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I'm hopeful about Bloodstained, at least
[3:23:57] <PlatinumWyvern> speaking of kickstarter, remember when pat was pushing might no.9 WAY harder than anyone else Kappa
[3:23:57] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat 24 hour ShB!
[3:24:02] <$Brother_Coduss> you missed one in the top right of that room
[3:24:02] <+atlasbot1> did he see the super best friend portrait
[3:24:03] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat I dunno if anyone's ever asked you this or if it's a big question, but what do you love about Videogames?
[3:24:03] <aimlesshealer> Thinking on it, not knowing the items in BoI is like not knowing the enemy patterns in a Soulsbourne game. It's frustrating at first, but learning and dying is part of the game
[3:24:04] <Kuroukanou> lol Raubaun savage
[3:24:07] <Youwereeatenbyalid> that's an oof
[3:24:13] <talfurt> What happened to that game that was by the skullgirls people did it ever come out

[3:24:31] <%XzileGaming> Unsung Story!
[3:24:33] <%waifoong98> @DedlokPM LUL
[3:24:34] <%GarbageNirvana> What if you gave Capcom $500 and they let you put Elmo in a RE game
[3:24:37] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat 24 hour Dwarf Fortress before Joel does it
[3:24:38] <%nmaten> the best part about going back and listening to the old sbfc episodes is hearing the mighty no 9 hype
[3:24:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Whaat about Blue Omen Operation? It's one of those games you and Woolie looked at on the channel in the apst
[3:24:40] <+天使42199> @talfurt Indivisible ? not yhet
[3:24:41] <Calek> Commander Claw ruined Kickstarter for Pat forever
[3:24:41] <Kalcom> yes
[3:24:43] <b_ikki> yeah

[3:24:54] <On_Target> what about Ghost SOng
[3:24:54] <Caidezes> oof
[3:24:56] <pwnhills> Climb that ladder Pat
[3:24:56] <shinichizio> Project Phoenix doing the dirt is like that is bad
[3:24:57] <%MelBrooksKA> Bloodstained already had a good game with that 2D one, so I think it should be fine
[3:24:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> is that a trick question @AngriestPat
[3:24:59] <+ChaosVulpes> The ladder, go up and jump off it.
[3:25:00] <%Taisuru> @Grayhammatter I beat Raubahn Savage and it's my favorite moment in any MMO
[3:25:02] <pwnhills> it'll spawn the ghost
[3:25:08] <Mr_Strut> Did you get a refund?
[3:25:18] <+ChaosVulpes> Yay!
[3:25:19] <On_Target> I wonder if Barkley 2 is ever coming out
[3:25:20] <%Dioliciouss> whoa totally unexpected shovel knight
[3:25:23] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I'm still waiting on my Drift Stage

[3:25:31] <KatabolicRage> never before have I seen such a thorough PR sabotage
[3:25:39] <xvalltana> f cash
[3:25:50] <Mr_Strut> You can do a chargeback for Project Phoenix at least.
[3:25:50] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:25:51] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat what do you love about Videogames, per say?
[3:25:53] <+天使42199> @talfurt Yeah both Indivisible and Bloodstained should release this year
[3:25:58] <NumberTooBig> my only issue with Bloodstained at this point is they didnt go for visual novel and text for conversations and made us look up close at the B grade models
[3:26:04] <%SaltyDongs> His two balls became one
[3:26:06] <%MelBrooksKA> @On_Target Pretty sure Barley 2 is fucking dead
[3:26:12] <%epoladia> does that do 2 hits?
[3:26:15] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat I got a full refund for it.
[3:26:16] <%SrG00SE> i have a stage layout in my game that i have saved as CastleSuperBeast :) hoping ya'll will give me a shout out when i reveal
[3:26:19] <pwnhills> This music is sick though
[3:26:25] <%SaltyDongs> The prophecy Pat is the chosen one
[3:26:28] <Kalcom> i liked this battle
[3:26:29] <worldbrand> oh project phoenix was spearheaded by yura right? that guy took like a full year to send out dvds for one of eminence's concerts. i saw that shit coming for miles
[3:26:31] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> At least you didn't pay to kickstart shaqfu
[3:26:35] <%spiritofmojave> can I pay to resurrect Barkley 2
[3:26:36] <KatabolicRage> barkley 2 is... it's like the quintessential vaporware at this point, it pops up every so often with an update to remind people it still exists
[3:26:44] <xvalltana> honestly if you need an object outside of your character to hurt an enemy, you lose me
[3:26:45] <ameraaaaaa> you know you can just jump on the ball right
[3:26:46] <Kalcom> barkly 2 is never ever
[3:26:48] <turf_wind_and_fire> @AngriestPat Any chance you'll revisit Cuphead before the DLC comes out?
[3:26:49] <%primax104> yayyyyyy
[3:26:52] <+ChaosVulpes> Too spooky
[3:26:54] <+atlasbot1> i want to see your portrait

[3:27:07] <+Grayhammatter> the ghosts of all the backers monkaS
[3:27:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Barkley 2 will never be as good as Barkley 1
[3:27:11] <%primax104> appropriate eh
[3:27:14] <turf_wind_and_fire> @MelBrooksKA Yeah dude

[3:27:19] <NumberTooBig> @MelBrooksKA new island or something
[3:27:21] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Barkley 2 is a myth
[3:27:25] <+天使42199> the thing that sucks about Barkley 2 is that they can't use things from barkley 1 due to licensing bullshit.
[3:27:25] <+ChaosVulpes> We mock because we love.
[3:27:26] <ShichiNoBushi> It's as if it was a lesson or something.
[3:27:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> It was chaos dunked out of existence
[3:27:33] <worldbrand> it's kinda true, barkley 1 is kinda great because it is a lone island
[3:27:36] <rosemon5001> did you ever go to the basement of the first town?
[3:27:39] <%ThePuddingDead> cuz we know you can take it
[3:27:39] <lloyddboy> I was looking forward to Routine :(
[3:27:39] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat have you heard about hollow knights sequel?
[3:27:41] <ameraaaaaa> we love because we mock
[3:27:41] <JanusII> Social commentary.
[3:27:46] <%lewdskeletor13> We mock because we love
[3:27:47] <%ThePuddingDead> as would we watch u
[3:27:47] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It would
[3:27:48] <%spiritofmojave> Barkley 2 was the friends we made along the way!
[3:27:48] <%SrG00SE> barkley was the best
[3:27:51] <zargy> Apparently they're still working on it
[3:27:51] <turf_wind_and_fire> Didn't they release a Barkley 2 trailer?
[3:27:53] <foreverN2dust> YEYEYE
[3:27:56] <Nina96> @Brother_Coduss he has
[3:27:57] <KatabolicRage> I too would like to breed and shoot deadly gun's
[3:27:57] <+theKingRamses> GOLD

[3:28:01] <+Grayhammatter> GOLD
[3:28:02] <Youwereeatenbyalid> but that will never happen
[3:28:04] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat it's still happening but the money ran out or something
[3:28:05] <ameraaaaaa> what does gold do again
[3:28:06] <DaHaLoJeDi> Imagine, if this game had turned out bad that place would've been in such poor taste
[3:28:06] <NeroInfinite> Barkley 2 is a myth we'll never see it
[3:28:06] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Who @Youwereeatenbyalid
[3:28:09] <%Futurecity10> reminder that shaq fu is a thing

[3:32:51] <televisedrevolting> God I could go for crab rolls right now.
[3:32:55] <KatabolicRage> the most bullshit "crab" are crab sticks, which I suspect have never seen a crab in their life
[3:32:57] <+ahegotrigger> ever made crab rangoon Pat?
[3:32:57] <%Verd_254> crab and lobster are just sea insects, i can't deal with it
[3:32:59] <%Toynota10> You or Paige try puffer fish in Japan?

[3:54:55] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat cause people like that, they only yell at what's going on in the game and talk about nothing. variety streamers like you only stream for a few days cause you talk about interesting stuff that captivates YOUR audience, not the game's
[3:54:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But I guess if you want the freakish ability to go through five soulsborne games in a row without taking any hits thats how you do it

[3:59:28] <%ThePuddingDead> they did do fem dante on Monster Hunter u silly @AngriestPat
[3:59:29] <+SWindleFeD> I wonder if Dante and Bayonetta would actually get along
[3:59:30] <%terminallyCapriciousz> is the beep boop from paige?
[3:59:32] <CybertronPrime> No, Bayonetta is Joker's mom.
[3:59:32] <$cureneckbeard> Bayonetta is gender bent Hideo Kojima
[3:59:32] <DaHaLoJeDi> Lady Dante is Nero's Auntie = Dauntie

[4:00:12] <Nina96> @AngriestPat does it feel werid when people quote u?
[4:00:13] <stabbityrabbit> A genderbent Dante would have to be a goober, grizzled, and kinda hot. Not sure who fits that.

[4:00:18] <%galaxyswirl> PILLARS WAS RAD
[4:00:19] <@PeachSaliva> Patty so handsome and stronggggg
[4:00:21] <Darren716> Bu NO one watched those Pat
[4:00:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> because pillars is boring
[4:00:23] <%spiritofmojave> Hey I thought the Pillars VODs were the comfiest things
[4:00:24] <%Toynota10> only boring people get bored
[4:00:24] <%MagickBurritoh> Pat you need to let it go
[4:00:25] <%mercado94> i have no interest on MK11. Did they do something new compared to X?
[4:00:26] <sukiyakiwestern> Turtle Kombat 11
[4:00:26] <i_worship_his_shadow> I liked it
[4:00:26] <Serge_12> Was there an update for Shovel Knight?
[4:00:29] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it's great
[4:00:31] <deafmutelaughing> Pat you missed a fishing
[4:00:32] <lloyddboy> FISH
[4:00:33] <$nademonkey1100> im still watching the vods
[4:00:33] <+NekoNinja13> genderbend dante would probably look like their mom and would likely have a daddy complex
[4:00:33] <%ThePuddingDead> to be fair, u got me into trying and liking divinity: original sin 2 so a point to u
[4:00:34] <%Futurecity10> I personally loved the pillars streams
[4:00:34] <Dr_Mooose> maybe not that much
[4:00:35] <%SaltyDongs> fish
[4:00:37] <%Toynota10> @peachsaliva when you gonna do make up with Pat on stream?
[4:00:37] <Crankthulhu> @mercado94 They took out combos
[4:00:38] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Pat, explain the Kamidogu and why it's the best
[4:00:38] <Mrbaconator> I liked it
[4:00:39] <%Laecerelius> Ignore bomb, get treasure
[4:00:40] <majindusto> Well, to be fair...IT'S FUCKING PILLARS!
[4:00:40] <+SWindleFeD> Missed a fishing spot @AngriestPat
[4:00:40] <%GarbageNirvana> Speaking of which, you ever gonna revisit Divinity 2?
[4:00:42] <%gus_hornblende> @AngriestPat man, you say that, but those pillars streams were so chill and pleasant to watch while at work. They also totally got me to play and love the series
[4:00:42] <%ElenaManetta> Hey bitch you STILL GOT DONATIONS DURING THAT STREAM RIGHT? I mean not from me, BUT FROM OTHER PEOPLE
[4:00:44] <thegreenbenis> More like Pillars of Snoozeternium!
[4:00:45] <+oOZtkOo> @AngriestPat have you finished original sin 2 yet pat?
[4:00:49] <extradopeness> Yea i caught you telling Clemps to B-E AGGRESSIVE
[4:00:50] <TwinBat> maybe the problem wasn't the game but for how long it was streamed for?
[4:00:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I have not mustered enough strength to watch that entire shit show
[4:00:55] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> No, it literally is 10% of his streaming life by hours
[4:00:57] <braincraft> This level reminds me of that terrible Mickey Mouse NES game.
[4:01:01] <%mercado94> @Crankthulhu i could do my research but im lazy so I'll believe you
[4:01:03] <ValidVenasaur> tbh i found every other crpg you played after pillars to be more entertaining @AngriestPat
[4:01:04] <+blademaster247> Didn't Pillars also only get like 10% of your average concurrent viewers
[4:01:04] <%Cthulos> pillars of eternity is the Fighterpedia of Pat Stares At? Whaaaaat?? Noooo...
[4:01:10] <+Grayhammatter> sounds about right
[4:01:11] <Nina96> I still rewatch you pillar stream every now and than @AngriestPat
[4:01:14] <%waifoong98> the trashguffin
[4:01:14] <+Gooniekorn> i fucking love MK stupid stories
[4:01:16] <%spiritofmojave> that's about right
[4:01:16] <+theKingRamses> it solves problems in the way monkey's paws do
[4:01:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Was Raiden's amulet a kamidogu
[4:01:17] <%starotter70> Does it just makes things worse?
[4:01:18] <troxcree> It created more problems than it solved
[4:01:21] <CybertronPrime> In fact, the Kamidogu causes most of the problems
[4:01:22] <+linSP> arent all the coolest guys still dead in mk11
[4:01:22] <Dr_Mooose> but what about that one time? you know that time
[4:01:22] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat the new timeline changed it into a buncha fancy knives
[4:01:25] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> And then it was KNIVES! For some reason...???
[4:01:25] <%DedlokPM> The Kami Dougu is a McGuffin
[4:01:25] <+Grayhammatter> the maguffin
[4:01:27] <majindusto> Pillars is Stream Poison
[4:01:30] <mightyfat> It’s magic
[4:01:33] <pillowwasp> Where’s rain
[4:01:33] <CptBritches> When is Ed Boon himself going to be a guest character?
[4:01:35] <%vincerocmm> there fancy limited dinner plates
[4:01:35] <$nademonkey1100> crazy talk
[4:01:36] <$KnivesEve> watch the kami dogu be an important part of mk11
[4:01:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> who is Frank Mortal Kombat
[4:01:41] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Reptile is the strongest character in fiction
[4:01:45] <%ShaneWhite> Play Starlink or aka Ubisoft Starfox
[4:01:46] <+Flamefish345> @angriestpat could you and Paige play Crafted World co-op on stream? It'd be hilarious
[4:01:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> @PeachSaliva HEt, Pat got all those drawings of him as a hot gurl, when do you get drawings of you as a studmuffin?
[4:01:49] <disister1201> did you watch the cyber shadow trailer? @angriestpat

[4:02:17] <SixthSun2> Isn't that Shinnok's pendant?
[4:02:18] <$nademonkey1100> BIG WRONG
[4:02:19] <%Niney_Who> Give Reptile a huge bulge to appease the scalies
[4:02:27] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Kamidogu was the whole plot in the MKX comic. Reiko used it to become the blood god or some horseshit.
[4:02:27] <+Grayhammatter> reptile the INVISIBLESSED
[4:02:28] <$KnivesEve> thats shinnok's isnt?
[4:02:28] <majindusto> Fuck Reptile...Give Me Rain!
[4:02:32] <%mercado94> really???
[4:02:38] <%tinyswampthing> mk11 has the best netcode of any fighting game ive played
[4:02:42] <Rhinoprotoss> This isn't Spectre Knight...
[4:02:43] <MiskatonicAlum> cyber shadow is the yacht club published ninja game
[4:02:45] <b_ikki> mkx had great netkode
[4:02:49] <sukiyakiwestern> no reptile no buy
[4:02:49] <NumberTooBig> a game with a budget has good netcode, well i've never
[4:02:50] <+butch_deadlift> nrs has had good netcode cause its designed for na
[4:02:51] <%mercado94> that sounds so good to be true
[4:02:55] <ameraaaaaa> oh my god i looked up female dante
[4:02:55] <MissMalisin> KappaPride
[4:02:57] <disister1201> It's the yacht club published ninja game @angriestpat

[4:02:59] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Max was playing dudes all the way in New Zealand flawlessly
[4:02:59] <Timesteel> netcode has been good for nrs games since MK XL
[4:03:04] <%ElenaManetta> I do
[4:03:06] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @b_ikki mkx only had good netcode after that major overhaul they did
[4:03:07] <ameraaaaaa> just leaving it at that
[4:03:10] <immortan_joel> Isn’t Cyber Shadow the new yacht club game?
[4:03:11] <Dr_Mooose> who says I can't
