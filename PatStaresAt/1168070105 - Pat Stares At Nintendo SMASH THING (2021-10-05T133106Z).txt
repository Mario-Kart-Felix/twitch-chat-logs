[0:45:25] <mortificent> ohh best theme
[0:45:26] <Zerenis> Aqua will show up and almost win a fight. Then lose at the last second.
[0:45:26] <Neo_Kaiser> The worst part about Sora being in Smash is that it will make the KH fandom happy.
[0:45:29] <Ipsenscastle> Are Sora's actual feet really that big, like Sideshow bob?
[0:45:29] <+MrATheGreat> he glides for his dash
[0:45:30] <Sokumotanaka> shut up pat!
[0:45:30] <+Deekman> Weird we haven’t seen a stage yet

[0:45:45] <+flyingtentaclemonster> Aqua is the only competent KH character LUL
[0:45:48] <GothicGhoulie> I wonder if they are going to add smash to kh?
[0:45:55] <peachy996> @Neo_Kaiser ah but the KH fandom will have to deal with the Smash fandom now
[0:45:58] <+lukeamania> wait does this mean that roxas and xion could be echo fighters
[0:46:02] <peachy996> And then neither will be happy
[0:46:02] <%machshop> why is pit fighting pit

[0:46:16] <HotMafia81> The more time goes on, the more I dislike every KH besides the first on
[0:46:17] <+ultimateDoompool> Late stage capitalism is Disney and Nintendo merging
[0:46:18] <+Leonnald> I love these smash directs. It's just like a relationship. Exciting, fun, makes you feel good. But then the announcement, and you're just left disappointed and asking why you ever bothered.
[0:46:19] <+Sushi2k> Kingdom Hearts used to be Final Fantasy X Disney
[0:46:21] <+yungkame> you know whats interesting? this could totally roll over into the next kingdom hearts
[0:46:21] <+SmartAssPawn089> FF and KH belong together

[0:48:16] <shadowcrisis> @LoveXKnife I can't believe it's not butter
[0:48:21] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Oh no, not another pk freeze
[0:48:21] <graemecrackers2> Etika would be freaking out <3
[0:48:23] <Ukokira> He looks like the most annoying character to play against I love it
[0:48:24] <ArguablyEpic> I wish they had somehow de-aged Haley Joel Osment to get the original voicing
[0:48:25] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> I'm glad I can finally see who is more powerful, Sora or Wario
[0:48:32] <Jaysky> He doesn't so much damage but can combo and defend ledge well
[0:48:37] <Jaysky> *do much
[0:48:39] <Solidnick18> i wish
[0:48:43] <Zerenis> That was super Dark Souls bait
[0:48:45] <An_Armed_Bear> Darkness though
[0:48:45] <+HotBloodedHero> I just realized this makes 2 and a half representation for Squeenix and half a representation for Disney.
[0:48:46] <Hydrapissed> zzzzzzzzzzzzz
[0:48:51] <Jaysky> I totally thought it was Dark Souls at first
[0:48:53] <DusK_The_Stray> It was ultra bait, that's not a thing in KH
[0:48:56] <%zeroarturia> @graemecrackers2 pour one out for etika
[0:48:57] <cinnamonpyroll> Aside from magic, no fire motif
[0:48:58] <Blank9> it was definitely dark souls bait
[0:49:04] <+CelioHogane> POCKET THUNDAGA
[0:49:05] <LoveXKnife> that was on purpose lol
[0:49:05] <Blank9> and then seemingly tales of arise bait
[0:49:08] <brachydios777> I also thought Dark Souls
[0:49:10] <Phob05> It would be weird if NOT Sora was the last Smach character
[0:49:10] <Seth_Tek> Yo Total war just dropped a trailer for the Terracotta Sentinels
[0:49:10] <Jrocy247> it was SUPER baited
[0:49:11] <%ElkRiverDog> ElkRiverDog extended their Tier 1 subscription through November! 
[0:49:22] <Hydrapissed> BBB B B BBBBB
[0:49:25] <+sphiraki> it was dark souls bait but it makes some sense. it was that it was becoming dark in the room and sora brought back the light
[0:49:32] <tijikiotecalt> I think they already showed it, its a wario spin
[0:49:32] <swizznatch> dark souls created bonfires
[0:49:33] <SilverFaustX> but wait , we have 1 more reveal.. Kappa
[0:49:33] <+Deekman> I can’t believe we haven’t seen the stage
[0:49:33] <+SmartAssPawn089> HMMM
[0:49:35] <Zeppelee> I'd rather have Solaire than fucking Sora.
[0:49:35] <%RayReborne> its a spinning swing, it got used earlier
[0:49:37] <Hydrapissed> pk fire
[0:49:38] <Sterski> You saw it earlier, it's a Link-style spin
[0:49:38] <Sokumotanaka> it was in general bat for suspension
[0:49:38] <Jaysky> Neat
[0:49:39] <iosephe> cute
[0:49:40] <%machshop> stopuga
[0:49:42] <floornine> THE REVEAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN NAMINE HOLDING UP A DRAWING OF SORA AND MARIO
[0:49:44] <+Shishi1205> thank god
[0:49:44] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Pretty sure he already used it as a recovery, and it was just an attack
[0:49:45] <themountaindwarf> how is the salt
[0:49:46] <%redthebaron> cute
[0:49:48] <+SmartAssPawn089> Aww just show

[0:57:36] <+yungkame> sealing the keyhole in stamina mode
[0:57:37] <lilmac64> Knowing that Kazuya, Steve, Banjo, and Sora are all in the same game is physically disorienting.

[1:06:30] <Jaysky> Port this I'd hope
[1:06:31] <%Leonnald> Just let it die
[1:06:33] <%fugly_nick> They can't possibly rerelease it without removing characters
[1:06:34] <%kyh9> They can't really port this one forward without re-negotiating the rights, I think
[1:06:34] <%Th0ms0nStuart> how long until a complete edition is released?
[1:06:34] <Sokumotanaka> Joker was the best reveal imo
[1:06:35] <%TrafficCohen> Port this for Switch 2, new one on Switch 3

[1:06:43] <rosemon5001> its got to be porting forward because of the rights yea
[1:06:43] <Hydrapissed> FADE AWAY

[1:07:25] <fudgsicles117> one last time
[1:07:25] <rosemon5001> imagine it being a fake out
[1:07:26] <jorniev> I WISH IT WAS DARK SOULS
[1:07:26] <%redthebaron> mario linking the flame
[1:07:27] <+infinitelymellow> Disappoint me a second time
[1:07:28] <huskarl_zap> boring
[1:07:28] <Goraka91> Dark Souls as fuck
[1:07:29] <+フォーンクルックミキヒロ> おつかれれれー！
[1:07:29] <%JoshManVGH> Gonna push to that 90th character?
[1:07:29] <%Leonnald> So when does the real character reveal happen?
[1:07:31] <Sotetsu> That is totally Dark Souls.
[1:07:31] <solfuture> not chosen undead :(
[1:07:31] <%LucasifTheOdd> Here we go with this dark souls trailer tease again
[1:07:32] <Tham1k> Solaire let's gooooo
[1:07:32] <iosephe> absolutely
[1:07:32] <+pectusumbra> Thank you Sakurai.
[1:07:33] <OpehVented> Ooooh
[1:07:34] <%hewlettfan96> He died right after they filmed that take
[1:07:34] <Afterman_> this doesn't hint sora at all lmao
[1:07:34] <%g0atmeal> This is also pretty Kindom Hearts'y
[1:07:35] <jtsoppy137> Get PUNKED PAT
[1:07:35] <otakon17> that's the light fading from Waluigi fans
[1:07:35] <JonnyZeFox> there was NO WAY it was dark souls LUL
[1:07:35] <Aoworth> They knew what they were doing
[1:07:36] <%Sunriser41> sakurai vigil is over
[1:07:36] <Zerenis> It looks exactly like the Furtive Pixie
[1:07:36] <+TopTieramisu> UNCHOSEN UNDEAD
[1:07:36] <%Movemeister> Return the world to LIGHT
[1:07:36] <%polothegreatest> hahaha what if S3
[1:07:36] <+CelioHogane> THEY ARE TOYS
[1:07:37] <+InfectedEzio> it doesn't look anything like the bonfire
[1:07:38] <%dankjerri> sora gave them all hearts
[1:07:39] <huskarl_zap> smash is a party game
[1:07:39] <Ipsenscastle> I'm so sad it wasn't Dark Souls
[1:07:40] <+cruzee73> thats as dark souls a it gets
[1:07:41] <Axl_Frost> Sakurai is gonna work on Nick Brawl next.
[1:07:41] <fudgsicles117> Mario linking the flame
[1:07:41] <%solracc25> We got John Doom
[1:07:41] <%holydeviant1> Imagine if it's Dark Souls THIS TIME
[1:07:43] <Blank9> it's dark souls as fuck, then tales of arise as fuck
[1:07:43] <%trackles_64> Geeef
[1:07:44] <MaritimeSpanker> It the biggest "meh" ending
[1:07:45] <%machshop> they were toys the whole time !?!
[1:07:45] <TheMadBadger> It's the same noise from bonfires too.
[1:07:47] <+Hawk_Rush> big snores
[1:07:48] <%valriot> The lack of Disney, Donald and Goofy, and the SONGS we like, this dropped to a 5/10 imo
[1:07:49] <themountaindwarf> funko pops
[1:07:49] <MaritimeSpanker> unless you're a KH fan I guess
[1:07:49] <otakon17> I hear a 'Gief snoring
[1:07:50] <%JoshManVGH> They are all Amiibos
[1:07:50] <%Birdigalore> I was expecting Master Hand since they all turned back into figures
[1:07:50] <+sabertoothzombie> because it's fire? that's a stretch
[1:07:52] <%ThomasOfTroy> Until Mario threw the flame, it 100% looked like it'd be the chosen unded
[1:07:53] <%dankjerri> OH MY GOD HE GAVE THEM ALL HEARTS
[1:07:53] <+flyingtentaclemonster> Fakeout and a half
[1:07:53] <+Shikari21> This was such a jebait
[1:07:54] <+sleepers1mulant> gief snore
[1:07:54] <not_twitter_rowan> yeah that was specifically attacking Dark Souls fans
[1:07:55] <NitronStreams> THIS IS DARK SOULS AS FUCK
[1:07:56] <%greasypete00> it's so dark souls it's not even funny
[1:07:56] <+AH_Steve17> FOR A SECOND THO
[1:07:56] <Hydrapissed> WHAT A fake out
[1:07:57] <$Sasha_conyst> literally though the entire look was darksouls
[1:07:58] <Necnill> Woken by their urge to kill
[1:07:58] <+SmartAssPawn089> THAT is some Souls, the swerve
[1:07:59] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Now... Announce Smash Definitive Edition with ALL DLC included.
[1:07:59] <%g0atmeal> FURTIVE PYGMY JOINS THE BATTLE
[1:07:59] <+MrATheGreat> It'd be super funny if this was a second trailer for Solaire
[1:08:00] <OpehVented> Toys!
[1:08:01] <%RayReborne> its like dang what a twist

[1:08:10] <LoudmicRPG> KINDLE THE FLAME
[1:08:10] <Drowsy_Tuna> JUST KIDDING ITS IFRIT SUCK IT NERDS THAT WAS A JOKE
[1:08:11] <+Spreadjohn> Yo is that Chris Pratt
[1:08:11] <+SusieTomoe> It’s literally the same type of flame as dark souls’s flame
[1:08:12] <Sokumotanaka> This is bait in general for anything guys
[1:08:13] <+MrATheGreat> It's a double fake out
[1:08:14] <SnowDayJ> Sora being in smash made a bunch of groomers happy
[1:08:14] <DHBoi> can't please everyone i guess
[1:08:15] <tubit> Burn it all Mario!
[1:08:16] <+shouttothevoid> he's literally going to kindle the bonfire
[1:08:17] <Ninjalettuce> Give it to me mario, your dark soul

[1:08:24] <+admiral_of_crunch> What if it's dark souls THIS time?
[1:08:24] <Tham1k> I can't believe solaire is in smash omg
[1:08:25] <%JoshManVGH> Luigi discovers dark sticky humanity
[1:08:26] <%BubbaRands> DIDNEY WORL
[1:08:28] <%redthebaron> mario hollowed
[1:08:29] <peachy996> Your one mickey reference
[1:08:30] <BirdcakeMN> He even fucking grabs the ember like the firekeeper in the opening
[1:08:32] <+SmartAssPawn089> Skkkrt
[1:08:33] <radregice> a small part of me feels like the fake out was somehow an accident LUL
[1:08:34] <+Shikari21> But why does it turn into a keyblade
[1:08:35] <An_Armed_Bear> I was super scared the fire meant Cinderace actually
[1:08:38] <+trafalgarsean> oh look, the disney logo, to the person earlier who said it wasnt there
[1:08:40] <Hydrapissed> what a fucking fake out ...
[1:08:40] <%trackles_64> Boooo
[1:08:40] <+cruzee73> they have hearts!
[1:08:40] <+Shikari21> I just dont understand
[1:08:41] <%RetroCop87> It's kinda weird how Strike Raid is in the trailer, but not the moveset
[1:08:42] <Zerenis> True. Mario is a key blade wielder
[1:08:43] <Pnutz409> Spider-man in Smash!?
[1:08:43] <Sotetsu> Simple and Clean is the way that Smash players aren't.

[1:08:47] <otakon17> Even a single point of light, can banish the darkness.
[1:08:47] <%YakumoYomi> Mario is technically a "Keyblade Wielder"
[1:08:48] <+MelodyMedley> When you walk away
[1:08:54] <+MrTurtleThief> AngelThimp

[1:09:25] <%JoshManVGH> "Finally"
[1:09:27] <HotMafia81> Look at this fuckin dork
[1:09:27] <themountaindwarf> THE PROTAGONIST OF SMASH

[1:09:52] <Hydrapissed> fuck the dumb castle
[1:09:53] <+sleepers1mulant> its ok, the music is good and the moveset is great
[1:09:55] <%g0atmeal> i will never get tired of this music
[1:09:56] <Zerenis> I hope Sora has special intros with Cloud and Sephiroth
[1:09:56] <+Ninjamaninjas> Now they just have to make smash a world in KH4 and the cycle will be complete
[1:09:57] <SilverFaustX> atpDance
[1:09:58] <+MelodyMedley> I'd say this is a good way to end it
[1:10:02] <NeroInfinite> oh he seals them in the dark realm lmao
[1:10:05] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Final Smash, hello!
[1:10:05] <%RayReborne> KINGDOM SMASH IS MEMES

[1:10:09] <%hewlettfan96> This music is insane lol
[1:10:11] <otakon17> REMATCH OF THE AGES
[1:10:12] <DusK_The_Stray> That Final Smash feels very underwhelming
[1:10:13] <TheHotStuven> I did that!
[1:10:13] <%Aleate> That was cool
[1:10:14] <+MrTurtleThief> yoo
[1:10:15] <anthropomorphictempest> canon

[1:10:16] <+Shikari21> This is sick
[1:10:16] <Jaysky> Neat way to show the costumes
[1:10:18] <%dankjerri> FUCK THATS SO GOOD
[1:10:19] <jorniev> DAMN+
[1:10:19] <%JoshManVGH> I mean if nothing else, Sora was one of the early harbingers of the Cross Brand Apocalypse, so it's fitting that he would be in Smash
[1:10:23] <%Scarnehu> only disney is the keychain. incredible
[1:10:24] <pet_purple_panda> so thats 3 square characters for DLC all closed off their seasons
[1:10:24] <%kyh9> That was cute
[1:10:25] <jorniev> GOODBYE SMASH
[1:10:26] <+krispen_wa> THE SCREEN FADE

[1:10:30] <%kyh9> That was a really cute scene with DeDeDe
[1:10:32] <+SusieTomoe> I bet Disney asked for an insane amount of money for their characters to show up so they just said fuck it
[1:10:32] <radregice> i love that they added the fade out effect
[1:10:32] <+Shikari21> Show kirby sora
[1:10:33] <brachydios777> Nice
