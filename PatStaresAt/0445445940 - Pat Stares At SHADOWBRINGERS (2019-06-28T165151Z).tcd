[0:28:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> it's so small.
[0:28:39] <Edible_Enthusiasm> isn't that just ironworks
[0:28:40] <%templar010> No Ironworks Gunblades or chakrams yet
[0:28:43] <dybia> The metal expansion where the first dungeon is populated by pixies
[0:28:43] <+Pookiedaexzile> Look at his legs when he jumps
[0:28:46] <laserbeaming> Kinda looks weird on such a big character
[0:28:46] <$SGrim> Folding gun = barrel explosion
[0:28:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> Final Fantasy tactics chocobos are still the best ones
[0:28:50] <+yunngin> do the different mounts actually do differetn things?
[0:28:58] <%Ixiah> no

[0:29:27] <+Pookiedaexzile> This music is making the pass out set in
[0:29:28] <%VioletHeart> Also why would there be Ironworks chakrams/gunblades when the class starts at lv60?
[0:29:31] <+yunngin> why'd they take flying mounts out?
[0:29:33] <pimpinahz> @plagueofgripes lol yeah. it shoots blanks
[0:29:36] <+RocketBarrel> wait what weapons did they say DNC were? They are totally chakrams by looking at them
[0:29:39] <%castarts> The mountains are wind chimes I guess.

[1:47:54] <AzureHawk_Streams> That dude looks like he's from FF11
[1:47:55] <madogod> why do they have to have a loli race in this game?
[1:48:15] <$Yakobro> LUL

[1:48:18] <$Order_of_Mystery> because this game is made by a Japanese studio
[1:48:22] <madogod> live reject!!!
[1:48:22] <BunnyEmperor> The sperging begins

[1:49:07] <%Shikari21> dont think about it
[1:49:08] <laserbeaming> Does this mean you can't fuck him?
[1:49:08] <+Kavtech> It's a spirit floor.
[1:49:14] <madogod> @clempstwitch that makes so much since
[1:49:17] <%Owkono> he doesn't think about it
[1:49:24] <dagreenpillow> no gravity applies to ghosts
[1:49:26] <%brickwall35> he has no mass, he can't fall
[1:49:28] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> if he doesnt float on the floor level it freaks him out, like a cat
[1:49:30] <JSebz> Warrior of Darkness Requiem
[1:49:46] <+Lost_Zombie> It's pretty much all exposition for awhile tbh
[1:49:52] <%damienlunas> Dresden files explains that so perfectly. Ghosts stand on the ground because they remember being able to do that as humans. When they start thinking about the fact that walls and gravity shouldn't affect them they can move through them but they also start going insane and becoming less human.
[1:49:52] <ScrapSentinel> now make out with me, ardbert

[1:57:53] <absolute_cagemony> you did it.
[1:57:57] <jorniev> question, is he starting to play the expansion or did he already played some of it?
[1:57:59] <+PunishedMercer_> ouch
[1:57:59] <$SleepyMaribo> yeah the changes have definately made dungeon runs faster, final steps of faith was under 5 minutes
[1:58:12] <%HRDSalami654> I've done that before.
[1:58:14] <Prism_Wing> just the tip
[1:58:24] <thatpeteguy> Yeah it hurts but was a minor cut it bled a bit but I didn’t need a hospital
[1:58:26] <%HRDSalami654> It didn't hurt that much because all the nerves were gone. lol

[1:59:38] <absolute_cagemony> Pat's having a long loud big pee

[2:07:38] <%damienlunas> So I stopped playing FFXIV because I love Blue Mage, and the limited job shit was so stupid I became convinced that SE would continue to fuck up everything else. Am I crazy, and should I start playing XIV again?

[2:07:57] <%gespenst25> Heavensward was split in to two zones to begin with and you could do either first
[2:07:58] <BunnyEmperor> You basically choose which of the two paths to go first, but you have to do both anyway
[2:08:03] <haveswordmuststing> @damienlunas they'll patch it later Kappa
[2:08:06] <jorniev> dat MUSIC

[2:15:16] <%Kiyosuki> but I haven't heard a single song in this expa so far that wasn't great
[2:15:17] <errasos> ul'dah destroyed, nothing of value was lost LUL

[2:18:07] <%MysteryFaceX> What if these zones had no monsters because they have been overhunted?
[2:18:10] <Thalchampz> SourPls
[2:18:11] <BunnyEmperor> lmao Fell Cleave Bloodspiller
[2:18:12] <fireking900> kill it with fire
[2:18:14] <+TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Unmend jump in is the same, but you now immediately pop flood or edge to get damage up, spend meter mashing that out, then using blood weapon, delirium, and your oGCDs to get the damage up
[2:18:14] <worldbrand> i dig that cactuar because fasciated cacti can really just grow like that
[2:18:15] <$SleepyMaribo> you can totally do five
[2:18:18] <dredshift> Why does this look like the exact gameplay that's done at the starting city
[2:18:20] <haveswordmuststing> Ludicactolo
[2:18:21] <MarylandJutsu> BIG HEALTH
[2:18:24] <$sylphyyyy> sombrero cactaur is TOO CUTE

[2:18:50] <errasos> what is that cactuar
[2:18:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> DOES THAT EDGE Chocobo HAS FING Hooves
[2:18:57] <worldbrand> google 'cactus tree' they really just grow like that sometimes
[2:18:57] <errasos> i dont like it
[2:19:00] <$sylphyyyy> he has a big hat!!!
[2:19:04] <+burningface> @As a Machinist main, weaving all the Gauss Shots and Ricochets in between the combos is bizarre
[2:19:05] <%TheSniperJoe> They are BIG GOOD BOIS, and they are doing their best!
[2:19:13] <+captain_elsewhere> yeah its part of the armour sonofthedeepsouth
[2:19:14] <%spiritofmojave> they're good bigguns
[2:19:14] <majindusto> They are horrific
[2:19:21] <errasos> is black mage fun to play now?
[2:19:27] <+DZiffer> Oh no, the cactuar are growing cactuar!
[2:19:31] <%BlitzNeidhart> I still haven't got the hang of new DRK
[2:19:35] <%crazyspartan214> turn around
[2:19:36] <r_Foeburden87> BRD's a bit different. We are a bit more "Proc based"
[2:19:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> SAND
[2:19:37] <haveswordmuststing> i got a song from joni mitchel googling that
[2:19:38] <dickbuttwoman> The aether current is to your left
[2:19:41] <%MysteryFaceX> I would like to see if it plays the same as a Paladin.
[2:19:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Still getting used to all the SMN changes
[2:19:46] <+RittiFruity> Aether current Pat
[2:19:46] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat the entire sabotender emperadora bossfight is on top of its head
[2:19:54] <%Shikari21> this music is great
[2:19:56] <+burningface> It's weird that MCH lost all of its procs, and BRD got more proc reliance
[2:20:12] <+Stereotreme> yeah this zone's music might be the best zone music in the game so far
[2:20:13] <%Kiyosuki> How is the new MCH?
[2:20:20] <+burningface> Very fast
[2:20:32] <zedravan> anor londo
[2:20:36] <+Stereotreme> and that's saying a lot. HW had some bangers
[2:20:40] <+burningface> Like, you're constantly hitting oGCDs between your main combo
[2:20:43] <+AmanDotZip> CLIPPY
[2:20:54] <pswayde> Since when did Pat turn back into a thumb?
[2:20:59] <%nanaki_ff14> F
[2:21:01] <%Kiyosuki> that's cool, all the MCH mains I know all went DNC lol
[2:21:06] <dickbuttwoman> Right from the bridge is the aether current pat
[2:21:10] <%Kiyosuki> so its been hard to get a gauging on it
[2:21:15] <+AmanDotZip> I think next gen is when clipping is a relic
[2:21:27] <%Shikari21> dont tell Paige
[2:21:32] <+burningface> I abandoned MCH when RDM released, but went back to it for this
[2:21:34] <$sylphyyyy> paige: did someone say skeleton
[2:21:36] <zedravan> show it to paige
[2:21:37] <dredshift> And Paige is making an account now
[2:21:38] <Hispanacomida25> Paige has been activated she needs to see
[2:21:38] <+future_famous_person> !uptime
[2:21:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 21m.
[2:21:41] <BunnyEmperor> @AngriestPat go on top of that skeleton ripcage
[2:21:46] <dickbuttwoman> Was tryin
[2:21:52] <fireking900> DARK DOGGO
[2:21:56] <majindusto> Armor MUST clip
[2:21:59] <+AmanDotZip> pupper
[2:22:02] <%spiritofmojave> use your compass you stumby
[2:22:05] <haveswordmuststing> the best part of exploring new zones, aether currents
[2:22:05] <$sylphyyyy> sad doggo sounds
[2:22:08] <jorniev> doggo
[2:22:12] <+oOZtkOo> clemps pls
[2:22:13] <%GarbageNirvana> just curious, did they improve texture quality at all?
[2:22:16] <BourneWarrior> It's an MMO Weapins are gonna clip through your fancy ass armor
[2:22:20] <majindusto> BLUE
[2:22:20] <%nanaki_ff14> @clempstwitch Voring the wind!?!? xD
[2:22:22] <laserbeaming> I prefer the Chonkybo
[2:22:22] <Nina96> new dog?
[2:22:24] <+Fenlig> That mount looks really slow! also its a mess of visual effects
[2:22:30] <jorniev> look at the car
[2:22:32] <$SGrim> I didn't realize, until now, how little I wanted to hear Clemps say vore.
[2:22:37] <+burningface> Gauss Barrel and Richochet start with 2 charges and end with 3, so you're constantly weaving them between your 1-2-3 combo in between hitting Drill, Hot Shot and Overheat (to spam that one skill that reduces the cooldown on the oGCDs by 15 secs)
[2:22:47] <%madogod> they have a dumb convertible in this game.
[2:22:51] <$sylphyyyy> @sgrim welcome to my life lmfao
[2:22:53] <Prism_Wing> A "Friender", one might say.
[2:23:01] <+TONYOO101> does pat have all the doggos?
[2:23:02] <fireking900> the ribs have a name
[2:23:05] <ChoculaUltra> don't you know? if your mounts in mmos don't glow, people won't know how rare they are Kappa
[2:23:09] <BunnyEmperor> @AngriestPat if youre into sightseeing logs, there is a spot on the cliff next to you
[2:23:14] <Hispanacomida25> it's the car from XV I think
[2:23:17] <$SGrim> @sylphyyyy you're whole life is Clemps saying vore? That's terrifying.
[2:23:32] <+burningface> @AngriestPat If you want to move around quicker, remember the Fenrir Bike has the increased speed by default
[2:23:35] <majindusto> Those Cactuars are Freaky
[2:23:36] <%damienlunas> I love the giant Broccoloid Cactaur
[2:23:37] <$SGrim> @Prism_Wing why am I suddenly crying.
[2:23:40] <%Shikari21> its great
[2:23:42] <fireking900> awww hes trying to do the pose, ive 180ed on them
[2:23:43] <ChoculaUltra> also, title of the stream should be "Pat and Clemps stare at each other."
[2:24:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Hey Mord are Kobolds!

[2:27:03] <+Angrec> @AngriestPat well both the amalja and kobold dont have primals twisting them here
[2:27:05] <+burningface> It's because they're a normal race, not a beast tribe like those dirty Lalaf... Dwarves

[2:41:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is when east coast kids get out of school
[2:41:10] <%madogod> tell paige to play DbD
[2:41:11] <TioXyco> WoW players might be mad because it's lore is being destroyed, since the factions arebeing dissolved
[2:41:11] <yngvez> a day Kappa
[2:41:14] <%sshen> If anything the DDoS is just everyone trying to log in at the same time
[2:41:17] <%QueequegTheater> Clemps is doing it until male viera are confirmed
[2:41:23] <%ElenaManetta> Do WoW players even get mad, aren't they busy being mad at Blizzard
[2:41:23] <%Aeogard> @clempstwitch WoW classic and shadowbringers to fill in the gaps for each other!
[2:41:27] <waddle_dee1992> At least I met Alphy before the crash....

[2:42:05] <alrobot2014> its been a while since crazy talk activated in its original form
[2:42:07] <ChoculaUltra> cause more bullshit like this? it was insanely knee jerk of everyone to just say its WoW players but hey, if its WoW players that are the big bads then I won't fight it.
[2:42:07] <Zebroneath> Crazy Talk ruined aFF14
[2:42:08] <pectusumbra> Pat, too powerful
[2:42:09] <%depressed_skeleton> mmmm meee

[2:42:09] <$sylphyyyy> my STAND: [Crazy Talk]!
[2:42:10] <thwak> it's probably some anti-capitalism activists trying to stick it to the man
[2:42:10] <+Pomfles> did Pat just start? :O
[2:42:12] <+Fenlig> Honesty I wouldn't be surprised if people ddosing these things aren't from other MMO communities.
[2:42:13] <+augurgewalt> trying to play any mmo expansion on launch LUL
[2:42:13] <%Arnschen> Happy DDoS, @AngriestPat
[2:42:17] <Sorrowful_Suicide> At least the title is pretty annytfComfy
[2:42:19] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Crazy Talk is more powerful than the internet
[2:42:19] <%VantomPayne> @AngriestPat I was somehow online until the moment you said 'this is because i said it isnt it'
[2:42:20] <A_Red_Robot> On Cactuar and I got in

[2:42:23] <gerdzim3> @AngriestPat im on jp datacenter and we are fine here. might be useful info some way
[2:42:25] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan Mabinogi has no community to compete against
[2:42:26] <%Valdorick> The proper answer of any cause of DDoS's... ASSHOLES
[2:42:30] <%zyberion626> @AngriestPat I made it back in Pat

[2:42:49] <gunstar73> of course they are
[2:42:49] <jorniev> of course they are
[2:42:51] <%Gogogolem> DDo'sers are just people who hate that other people are happy.
[2:42:54] <%Arnschen> Probably the last one
[2:42:54] <KaseKaizer> also doesn't take nearly as much effort to DDoD something that's under so much strain already
[2:42:55] <+Koagz> 2000 queue evo17KO
[2:42:55] <%spiritofmojave> When aren't they
[2:42:58] <$valriot> @angriestpat I'm on EU and it's also fine
[2:42:59] <FairOnFire> Japan internet is too powerful
[2:43:00] <%PinkSuprende> good luck pat
[2:43:01] <%luftraumm1> well jp internet is something else
[2:43:01] <MagicMuffinx> europe servers seem fine right now
[2:43:01] <haveswordmuststing> Japan is smaller than many US states
[2:43:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Probably because Japan's infrastructure doesn't suck dick
[2:43:02] <+Phoosy> @AngriestPat The JP duty servers were down earlier this morning, they're not always fine ;^)
[2:43:02] <%nanaki_ff14> @AngriestPat Balmung is fine weirdly enough still playing
[2:43:05] <Edible_Enthusiasm> @AngriestPat I hope you didn't just grumble password numbers out loud.
[2:43:06] <alrobot2014> @waddle_dee1992 good taste, but that's quite a game to jump into at this time
[2:43:07] <+cinder_chan> well let's fuckin ddos the japanese servers guys!
[2:43:08] <%MysteryFaceX> Or the Japanese are better behaved?
[2:43:09] <jackythefrost> Crystal is also good rn but we are getting lag spikes
[2:43:15] <%budyd> I mean, it's 3pm EST, probably the first wave of post work people logging on
[2:43:16] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah EU servers are fine
[2:43:17] <%Valdorick> Its the Japanese! They're telling the Gaijens to go home!
[2:43:17] <ChoculaUltra> because accusing a group of people for no reason doesn't sit well with me? no matter the group? @SGrim

[2:43:20] <%DedlokPM> Funny thing is, I am still in the game. Though I had some brief disconnection things. North America
[2:43:22] <%yeknomlive> is it just the primal?
[2:43:23] <+Stereotreme> DDoS isn't hard to mitigate as long as you're actually monitoring it.
[2:43:24] <gunstar73> I'm on jenova and still in but
[2:43:25] <%Yadogari> Then it's EU WoW players Kappa

[3:12:34] <%Dwarven_Gaming> on a MMO going against wow?
[3:12:35] <MagicMuffinx> They confirmed its a DDOS
[3:12:35] <%Longerbone_ghm> business as usual I guess
[3:12:36] <%Dwarven_Gaming> yes you can]
[3:12:36] <$sylphyyyy> just keep saying it'll not get better and it will
[3:12:37] <ScrapSentinel> you can tho.

[3:12:50] <majindusto> Not just any actor...THE ACTOR WHO PLAYED NAGUMO
[3:12:51] <%budyd> DISAPPOINTED !!
[3:12:54] <%spiritofmojave> script kiddies just waking up
[3:12:55] <dickbuttwoman> At least the game isn't on fire like EvE is right now
[3:12:57] <%cappyd33> 10 ahead of me pat
[3:12:59] <%damienlunas> Wait, I think if Pat transfers from Ultros, he'll be stuck for 90 days.
[3:13:01] <moogleboy1984> The roadblocks were real at 5 am in the Crystarium
[3:13:02] <%Longerbone_ghm> I got like 5 hours before this happened at least
[3:13:04] <%madogod> @AngriestPat its not a great game unless someone DDOS it
[3:13:07] <BunnyEmperor> Nah Pat all zones are instanced regardless
[3:13:09] <%ESP_ROOT> pat your roe is cool
[3:13:13] <+ImperiusMex> Ive gotten back in for 15 minutes and its been stable. Im in Ultros
[3:13:13] <$Kaialb> @AngriestPat check FF14 news, there's info about DDOS
[3:13:15] <MagicMuffinx> But I think everyone went Alisaie first because she's a best
[3:13:20] <Jolnir> TPFufun
[3:13:20] <%Fatmanjoggin> it took like six hours to hit 71 for me
[3:13:21] <%damienlunas> Because it says if you transfer from a congested world, you can't transfer again for 90 days. And Ultros is congested.
[3:13:31] <moogleboy1984> couldn't see the gate keeper to Crystal punks inner sanctum for all the PCs standing on him
[3:13:31] <Jack_Nightshadow> spread people out but everyone goes for Alisae first.
[3:13:31] <Cdjgamer> they made that leveling system for old world content too
[3:13:33] <%joylent_blue> Kaialb he read it out earlier i think
[3:13:46] <$Kaialb> @joylent_blue oh cool, didn't realize
[3:13:49] <%Psyramics> but aren't they all self-contained stories?
[3:13:54] <Gnapalm> play eso
[3:13:54] <%joylent_blue> ye it was a few mins ago
[3:13:57] <%damienlunas> Oh wait, that's only for preferred, if you transfer to standard it's fine.
[3:13:58] <aqua_mashu> Personally I dont like scaling

[3:14:07] <Jolnir> pat stop self harming
[3:14:11] <Kokebear> no good
[3:14:12] <+Grayhammatter> yeahm that's a no
[3:14:19] <Slim_Lipid> So there's no reason to have levels in that MMORPG
[3:14:21] <%joylent_blue> FeelsBadMan
[3:14:24] <Slim_Lipid> if everything scales
[3:14:27] <Gnapalm> free world wide travel
[3:14:28] <%damienlunas> But you wouldn't be able to transfer back to a congested world anyway, so you'd have to wait for Ultros to stop being congested.
