[0:06:39] <%ahdurian> It's gonna be a shiny gem of a game
[0:06:39] <%Jekado> its by the people who did octodad so i assume its gonna get weird
[0:06:40] <$ragingbrachy> its by the octodad people so its probably tongue in cheek
[0:06:40] <%GrumblePlays> What up y'all, I just got a personal best time in RE7
[0:06:43] <%Typhaeon> I have 100% confidence in the Octodad devs

[0:06:49] <%tigerspath> hi Pat. hi chat.
[0:06:51] <%houhilburn> I think it's secretly a silent hill game @patstaresat
[0:06:54] <%spiritofmojave> I can't believe Kero Kero Bonito signed on to that...
[0:06:55] <%ahdurian> watch it get a 95 on MetaCritic

[0:07:01] <wyrdboy21121> hey @PatStaresAt what are your thoughts on PS5 reveal?

[0:07:03] <$ragingbrachy> yes
[0:07:03] <madskull456> itll be under the genre horror
[0:07:04] <%Valdorick> I mean, the creatures did combine in to a jump scare food golem and scare Paige.

[0:08:04] <%FaderPotater> Did pat every successfully become a traitor of America? If so I am very curious what random people that are checking out creators on the list think when they find pat.
[0:08:04] <%Lion_kun> Pat where Sony video pls
[0:08:08] <%maenos2> So like, horror thought. If ingesting it makes it a part fo you, what does swallowing do?
[0:08:10] <%genowyn> So far the most exciting thing about the PS5 is that the controllers use USB-C
[0:08:11] <%a_goth_pancake> just heard the podcast. if you feel like giving sea of thieves another try, point your cannons skyward; it's the universal signal for "please don't fuck with me."
[0:08:16] <cureneckbeard> Yeah I guess
[0:08:28] <+Saphnick> I think this is the first stream I've caught live
[0:08:29] <%Typhaeon> Guess you'll have to start posting them to Mix-pfffffhahahaha

[0:08:42] <%DappercatEsquire> That Godfall trailer sucked shit in two ways, then
[0:08:52] <ABigPinkLion> Do clips even exist anymore? I couldn't find the tab
[0:08:55] <%Rumbutt> Rendering is a pain in the ass
[0:08:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nothing of Value was Lost

[0:20:03] <%NeoCre> ARREST THIS MAN, HE KNOWS FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
[0:20:04] <KeiPrime> so now theres just a guy with a gun in this game? i mean i guess that's pretty scary
[0:20:10] <Grannatz> Rank means little of this game.
[0:20:10] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah its very strange
[0:20:14] <amiavamp> gun is the most dangerous villain
[0:20:16] <%Dustwalker44> This ranking system doesnt seem fair then
[0:20:16] <%W1nterTitan> Smurfs?
[0:20:18] <+snowcarmesi> pat has to be baked right?

[0:20:24] <%DappercatEsquire> bill-ee
[0:20:25] <%Typhaeon> What is your opinion on Doctor?
[0:20:26] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I'm actually really nterested in the new Ratchet and Clank game, the Demon's Souls remake, RE8, and that untitled Project Athia
[0:20:30] <Grannatz> I'm a rank 2 survivor who plays against rank 14 killers sometimes. it's rough
[0:20:30] <Estel013> Bill-eeeee
[0:20:35] <%heartlesshealer> ah, so specialist billee
[0:20:37] <%Typhaeon> I don't tend to see a lot of Doctor players
[0:20:37] <+tigerfang86> the CANON stage
[0:20:38] <ABigPinkLion> T H E M A T I C
[0:20:49] <%ragingocto1> that RE8 title card reveal was awesome
[0:21:04] <%NeoCre> Doc makes me happy
[0:21:09] <%de1ete_forever> Matt totally called the game name for re8
[0:21:15] <%DappercatEsquire> give it a lil hit
[0:21:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> @ragingocto1 You mean Village 8?
[0:21:19] <+Loinclothiclese> The power of GUN
[0:21:21] <+snowcarmesi> yeehaw mother shuckers
[0:21:28] <amiavamp> gun probably operates on CoD rules, have to wait a second before accuracy from zooming applies
[0:21:31] <Jetsfantasy> DBD looks much different with whatever this guy is
[0:21:31] <+tigerfang86> LMAO
[0:21:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> I haven't played Village 1-7, I'm going to be completely lost
[0:21:33] <%Valdorick> Pro
[0:21:35] <@SoFarFetched> she was waiting
[0:21:36] <FerwhateverDota> the points thopugh
[0:21:37] <%NeoCre> Tho I‚Äôm probably best with spirit and ghost boi
[0:21:45] <%JumboCrunchies> Im looking for a new killer. I've been playing Legion and Im not sure they're for me. How is Deathslinger?
[0:21:54] <%a_goth_pancake> baited.
[0:21:54] <+ItsAGundamu> which character is this?
[0:21:58] <%GraceTBM> @amiavamp pretty sure ads spread reduction is a linear curve, at least in MW 2019
[0:21:59] <@SoFarFetched> Deathslinger
[0:22:01] <%DappercatEsquire> can you disengage that shot earlier to avoid the break animation?
[0:22:01] <ScreamLord> So is this killer based on a particular character or are they original?
[0:22:02] <%Typhaeon> The chain seems very easy to deal with since they get so much lateral movement
[0:22:10] <+Hapsam> thats not Dungeons & Dragons!
[0:22:16] <%Starotter70> Cowboy Chain Man
[0:22:16] <@SoFarFetched> Dungeons By Dragons
[0:22:24] <amiavamp> @GraceTBM in at least one game they did it for sniper scopes to nerf quickscoping
[0:22:34] <%Tyndarian> Tell ya hwat
[0:22:36] <%WhereIsWill> this a cool stage
[0:22:55] <%a_goth_pancake> I really want xeno, dude...
[0:22:57] <%JumboCrunchies> @ScreamLord This one is original. Majority of the killers in DBD aren't from any specific other IP. Though there are a decent number.
[0:22:58] <%Ner234> @PatStaresAt If you're gonna play DbD more often have you considered changing your overlay so that it doesn't cut off the bottom left? Kinda wanna see it.
[0:23:04] <%sniffy77> There are games where you can look at someone play for a few minutes and just know you would suck horribly at them. This is one of them for me.
[0:23:05] <%a_goth_pancake> just lemme have it Fox.
[0:23:06] <%Starotter70> Nice
[0:23:06] <%NeoCre> Yee, and I cannot say this enough, haw
[0:23:09] <%mollymostly> while the survivors were out partying pat was studying THE GUN
[0:23:09] <%Valdorick> Yeye
[0:23:11] <maglebeast> Hey Pat and Chat! How's it going? We trying out the new Silent Hill stuff?
[0:23:18] <%pilgrimsayswhat> OUCHIE
[0:23:22] <%GraceTBM> magle pyramid head isn't out for a little longer
[0:23:24] <%Starotter70> @maglebeast Nah, it'll be out Tuesday
[0:23:45] <@SoFarFetched> Wonder if they are trying to do the quest of dropping a pallete on the killer
[0:23:54] <%Mitchwwk> Mitchwwk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Woah 18 months already! how time flies. I started playing DbD recently, put in about 45 hours with a nice mix of Killer and Survivor. Is it just me or are the killers generally pretty chill, while A LOT of the people who play survivor shitbag meme lords?
[0:23:55] <+tigerfang86> YOU.... did it
[0:24:08] <@SoFarFetched> That sounded lewd
[0:24:18] <$ragingbrachy> a deep wound does not sound lewd
[0:24:21] <%WhereIsWill> pat givin the DEEP wounds
[0:24:31] <%Ynkubus18> a gash is a gash
[0:24:31] <@SoFarFetched> oh I tought he said deep wood LUL
[0:24:32] <%de1ete_forever> a lwed mind is a lewd kinf
[0:24:33] <@SoFarFetched> thought*
[0:24:37] <%de1ete_forever> kind
[0:24:37] <%ChestMimik> Is it possible to play this as killer 100% of the time or do I have to actually be social to play?
[0:24:39] <DaKnightWarrior> Pat playing with his food
[0:24:39] <j0ustar> GET OVER HERE!
[0:24:44] <FlongBongle> Deep wewd
[0:24:51] <%a_goth_pancake> yeah dude, some survivors are toxic af. meanwhile I'm over here spinning on the floor next to the killer while they dance.
[0:24:52] <$ragingbrachy> ha-hoh
[0:24:53] <%NeoCre> Meh, more like Slight Scrape
[0:24:54] <ABigPinkLion> @ChestMimik I only play killer, no need to play survivor

[0:26:23] <%Valdorick> Wiff wiff wiff
[0:26:29] <%coffeeabomination> All those sweaty try hards
[0:26:33] <%a_goth_pancake> tip for potential survivors; if you get downed, throw your hands up and go "eh, happens."
[0:26:34] <+demon1103> Just remember, If you play killer: dont tunnel...or camp...or hook survivors....or equip perks....and wear a blindfold
[0:26:42] <%de1ete_forever> how dare they try and win
[0:26:42] <%WhereIsWill> land them shots you ORB
[0:26:47] <%spiritofmojave> @demon1103 LUL
[0:26:53] <j0ustar> StOp CaMpInG
[0:26:56] <%SovPho> wait where's the Gamer brand GamerCube?
[0:26:56] <$ragingbrachy> i cant tell if pat is doing good or not
[0:27:04] <Grannatz> Remember, if you're surivivor, and you get downed, the Killer tunneled you
[0:27:09] <%spiritofmojave> STOP PLAYING THE GAME THE WAY I DONT WANT YOU TO!
[0:27:09] <Grannatz> Pat's doing well
[0:27:15] <$ragingbrachy> cool cool
[0:27:17] <%marvel877> where are you aiming?
[0:27:19] <@SoFarFetched> I had someone tunnel me the other day,but they were pretty much just doing their quest of chasing a survivor for 90 seconds with a perk LUL
[0:27:19] <+killerweebslayer> killerweebslayer subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:27:20] <Torgue_1> Do survivors get killed when you hook them or do they slowly bleed out?
[0:27:27] <+SirFurther> too bad he doesnt shoot out grenades
[0:27:31] <+snowcarmesi> takes time
[0:27:31] <%ChestMimik> What's tunneling?
[0:27:32] <%weissguard> @spiritofmojave heh heh, harpoon gun go brrr
[0:27:33] <%WhereIsWill> how fast is that bullet? cuz it seems slow af
[0:27:35] <maglebeast> Which killer is this? only seen DBD a few times. Seems pretty cool
[0:27:35] <%Taisuru> Can you unlock characters for free in this or are they only Paid DLC?
[0:27:35] <venomfury86> Pat playing Painkiller?
[0:27:40] <+snowcarmesi> if you hook em 3 times its insta death
[0:27:41] <ABigPinkLion> I think he's doing pretty good, he has a nice 3 gen going and he's patrolling really well
[0:27:42] <@SoFarFetched> They even were like at the end "Sorry meg you probaly didn't sign up for this"
[0:27:46] <+Czar_Kazem> So I've heard this can be a rough time investment for new players, and the dev's aren't swell in the balancing department. Is it something you can recommend to new folks?
[0:27:47] <%spiritofmojave> @weissguard noooooo LUL
[0:27:48] <+SirFurther> @Taisuru paid
[0:28:00] <@SoFarFetched> There's a couple you get with the game like the huntress and nruse
[0:28:03] <@SoFarFetched> nurse*
[0:28:10] <ggabriel577> awesome that you're streaming this game now
[0:28:17] <%Starotter70> Killer Yeehaw man is comin for ya
[0:28:17] <%Garthunox> what perks is he running?
[0:28:30] <%SovPho> This is a great idea for a horror comedy. The bad guy is this dude who legitimately just can't hit shots so he ends up raging out and hitting people instead.
[0:28:38] <SMuffinMan> I see you got your AC fixed!
[0:28:39] <+snowcarmesi> @maglebeast its the deathslinger
[0:28:44] <+SirFurther> bbq, nurses calling and something else
[0:28:46] <%SovPho> Pat's obviously not raging though not to say he is.
[0:28:51] <+hailinpea> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:28:53] <%Valdorick> Not sure what she's trying.
[0:29:04] <%JumboCrunchies> I thought he didn't have BBQ on Deathslinger yet
[0:29:07] <Grannatz> What sucks is high rank gameplay usually revolves around a few set of meta perks, which you can only get through DLC characters, or the weekly shop that has 4 random per week
[0:29:09] <%JumboCrunchies> Or am I behind
[0:29:20] <$zyberion626> Is Pat going to watch the GG Strive character reveal?
[0:29:20] <%Nod80> Pat's Really Bob Rossing it up
[0:29:26] <Jetsfantasy> I see Pat's still playing Thresh despite not playing Runeterra Kappa
[0:29:28] <%AnIcedCoffee> @JumboCrunchies he said he got it the other day
[0:29:31] <@SoFarFetched> you got some good hits in
[0:29:36] <ABigPinkLion> Time for some leverage
[0:29:41] <%Starotter70> Hnnnnng
[0:29:47] <%TrafficCohen> God, Pat gives off such smug movie killer vibes "Whoops, I missed ya. I'll get ya next time tho"
[0:29:49] <thetruthofyourbeing> Nooo i can still get sum good hits in tho
[0:29:50] <%Valdorick> Now, how nice are they?
[0:30:02] <+SirFurther> well that was easy
[0:30:06] <@SoFarFetched> probably gonna try for other exit
[0:30:18] <%sniffy77> :3
[0:30:25] <%de1ete_forever> lol
[0:30:25] <@SoFarFetched> LUL that works too
[0:30:26] <%Starotter70> TOOK THE HIT

[0:30:32] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I figured it was open
[0:30:32] <%chambatron> GET DOWN MR PRESIDENT
[0:30:32] <amiavamp> Pat would probably be a good Mercenary in old Splinter Cell multiplayer
[0:30:33] <+hailinpea> what a hero
[0:30:33] <Jaketify> that was dope
[0:30:33] <%DatGuyJimbo> DatGuyJimbo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Keep up the good work Pat, your streams have come along way you deserve atleast another 0 to end of that view count bro

[0:30:35] <thetruthofyourbeing> POG
[0:30:35] <%Mindtrick_Matt> I play high rank survivor and don't use meta perks. Most people just cant loop and just get down when they use their one weapon the pallet
[0:30:35] <j0ustar> H E R O
[0:30:36] <%JumboCrunchies> Well done
[0:30:37] <+amiroodude> Damn what a hero
[0:30:37] <%Garthunox> that was fuckin sick
[0:30:38] <%WhereIsWill> bodyblock

[0:30:44] <%heartlesshealer> Absolute defender
[0:30:46] <%SovPho> but did you have fun?
[0:30:46] <@SoFarFetched> DIDNT COUNT WAS ONLY A WARM UP MATCH
[0:30:47] <Estel013> purple hair lady is the herrrrro
[0:30:52] <KeiPrime> DISPLEASED
[0:30:52] <j0ustar> Give that lady ALL the points
[0:30:53] <SMuffinMan> Erron Black? LUL
[0:30:54] <%Typhaeon> He has a tiny penis
[0:30:56] <Malisin_Murder> LUL
[0:30:56] <ScreamLord> Cow Pat prevails
[0:30:57] <%Starotter70> Oh yeah
[0:31:00] <+ItsAGundamu> has Pat played Pyramid head yet?
[0:31:00] <taquito_blade> yep they are
[0:31:00] <dinnydanny777> Time to watch some high level Dead by Daylight gameplay
[0:31:01] <$ragingbrachy> who would have thunk it
[0:31:01] <%ZComiX> you cant even be mad at that ending
[0:31:01] <%JumboCrunchies> @PatStaresAt Any consideration to move your cam to the Upper Left to show your perks?
[0:31:02] <j0ustar> per Pat's taste
[0:31:03] <%spiritofmojave> They sure are
[0:31:04] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt have you tried Save the Best for Last on Deathslinger?
[0:31:04] <+hailinpea> Every communtiy is toxic
[0:31:05] <%Valdorick> Toxcity, in the city, in the city.
[0:31:07] <%SovPho> because it's the internet and it's an inherently competitive game
[0:31:09] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[0:31:10] <thetruthofyourbeing> Why would they not be?
[0:31:12] <VritraReiRei> Toxic more than League of Legends or Overwatch? ü§î
[0:31:13] <Lt_Campbell> jermaPluto are they really that toxic?
[0:31:16] <@SoFarFetched> hahah chainsaw go brrrr
[0:31:17] <%Garthunox> its extremely toxic and they make up bullshit rules that you "have to" follow
[0:31:19] <+Skelegroove> When people can't communicate they just assume what everyone else is thinking
[0:31:19] <+hailinpea> Too many 12 year old on the internet
[0:31:21] <venomfury86> too much playing as killers
[0:31:21] <ABigPinkLion> Play leatherface coward
[0:31:24] <+Brostress> Coop games always end up becoming the most toxic.
[0:31:25] <+SirFurther> you might feel the same way if a killer was after you
[0:31:27] <+evilmagetim> Nice hat
[0:31:28] <%heartlesshealer> wait there's chat? I haven't been paying attention to any possible screen text
[0:31:28] <ShichiNoBushi> I'm addicted to you 'cause I know you are Toxic.
[0:31:32] <dinnydanny777> Who would think a game about running away from serial killers would be toxic
[0:31:34] <%Typhaeon> Pat, what is your least favorite killer besides Pig?
[0:31:36] <Jetsfantasy> Ah yes, the 20 gallon barrel of lube perk
[0:31:36] <thetruthofyourbeing> @Skelegroove THISSSSS
[0:31:38] <+ItsAGundamu> man I just got out of a DOTA 2 match, now thats toxic
[0:31:38] <%a_goth_pancake> but what's got him so spooked?
[0:31:38] <%de1ete_forever> glhf
[0:31:41] <@SoFarFetched> Chat is always after the match is over,like when you die as survivor
[0:31:42] <Lt_Campbell> When is Pyramid Head coming out?
[0:31:44] <+Skelex> killers don't like survivors who try too hard to win, survivors don't like killers who play too effectively, everyone winds up resenting everyone else
[0:31:47] <maglebeast> All of them human killers or do we we get like monsters and such?
[0:31:48] <+SirFurther> @heartlesshealer only post game
[0:31:55] <FerwhateverDota> Hey pat i think queues are long because a lot of people are playing the test build
[0:31:59] <@SoFarFetched> Pyramid Head is out on the 16th
[0:31:59] <+TheHiGHDOLMaSTER> Survivor playerbase is like 60% toxic
[0:32:01] <%AnIcedCoffee> Trapper is super fun
[0:32:02] <$Trenr> trapper is so much fun when he works
[0:32:03] <+TheHiGHDOLMaSTER> and 90% of the toxicity
[0:32:03] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Bing Bong boi
[0:32:06] <+demon1103> The booted up a game where you can play as a multitude of crazy killers and chose to play survivor......they clearly aren't right in the head XD
[0:32:07] <%heartlesshealer> Ah, okay. Seems like not the best idea for this kinda thing, but alright
[0:32:08] <ABigPinkLion> Trapper's very hard to play right
[0:32:10] <%JumboCrunchies> @maglebeast Most are human. But also there is a ghost and a demogoron
[0:32:12] <Lt_Campbell> @maglebeast theres lot of monstery monsters
[0:32:13] <%SovPho> Compare the communities of Path of Exile and this game. One game has weird optional pvp that sucks anyways and the other one is competitive. One has a better community.
[0:32:15] <+snowcarmesi> couple monsters, like oni and demogorgon
[0:32:16] <+TheHiGHDOLMaSTER> he super can
[0:32:17] <%DatGuyJimbo> @PatStaresAt Is the shape any good if i got that game feel like I would main him
[0:32:18] <bluefooddye1> huntress at level 1??
[0:32:19] <+SirFurther> freddy is best boy
[0:32:20] <$ragingbrachy> thats really funny
[0:32:21] <@SoFarFetched> Ive done that so many times cause I forget
[0:32:22] <$Trenr> yeah...
[0:32:22] <%Taisuru> lol, really?
[0:32:22] <%Typhaeon> I gotta get in on this game to see if wacky off-meta shit works
[0:32:24] <%Garthunox> Pat what's your opinion on the people who make up bullshit rules that you must follow or else you're toxic, e.g. tunneling and shit
[0:32:27] <cureneckbeard> Can the survivors kill the guy
[0:32:27] <%chambatron> Imsagine junkrast doing that
[0:32:27] <dinnydanny777> Well maybe that's how he's balanced
[0:32:29] <%Tyndarian> Here‚Äôs a happy little chainsaw
[0:32:36] <$ragingbrachy> the shape? monkaS
[0:32:37] <%Mindtrick_Matt> I like Trapper, but I need NOED to play him well
[0:32:37] <%a_goth_pancake> I cannot stress how fun it is to do the downed dance with cool killers.
[0:32:39] <%DatGuyJimbo> cheers
[0:32:41] <%FaderPotater> heard Freddy was garbage?
[0:32:41] <curse85> is freddy any good?
[0:32:46] <dinnydanny777> Yeah bro just camp
[0:32:46] <Zeldrick> @PatStaresAt How's The Demogorgon? I haven't heard anybody talk about it
[0:32:49] <%heartlesshealer> imposing homebrew on others is an asshole move
[0:32:51] <ABigPinkLion> Fuck the stupid rules, have fun
[0:32:51] <%Taisuru> No throws pat
[0:32:52] <Jetsfantasy> Good advice
[0:32:52] <@SoFarFetched> should have seen his tweet on when a guy got pissed at pat for tunneling LUL
[0:32:52] <twoto858> I can't believe there's no killer that can disguise itself
[0:32:54] <dapperskeleton69> what about the purge character? is he good?
[0:32:54] <KeiPrime> No Throwing house rules
[0:32:56] <%Valdorick> Good answer
[0:32:56] <dinnydanny777> Teamkilling is A Okay
[0:32:59] <%JumboCrunchies> Freddy got a solid rework
[0:33:00] <$Trenr> now freddy is top tier
[0:33:00] <comedeity> camp
[0:33:01] <Torgue_1> Shape of You?
[0:33:01] <Dreigun> I would mind less that he can step in his traps if colorblind options existed so I could see them
[0:33:02] <%Garthunox> freddy is great now
[0:33:03] <Morbidmort> The ONLY F tier
[0:33:04] <%FaderPotater> ah, that person mentioned they hadn't played in a while
[0:33:05] <+SirFurther> freddy is OD
[0:33:07] <VritraReiRei> How many points does Pat have to go until he reaches 1 million?
[0:33:08] <WholesomeCumiesPeddler> So what does tunneling mean in DBD context?
[0:33:11] <madskull456> i turn off messages when i play killer
[0:33:12] <$Trenr> I was gonna say top 3
[0:33:12] <%AnIcedCoffee> @Zeldrick Demogorgon is fun and probably the most "balanced" killer in the game. Hard to play really well though
[0:33:17] <dinnydanny777> Just spawnkill lol :)
[0:33:23] <+SirFurther> freddy is the counter for top level strats
[0:33:24] <%spiritofmojave> it's as dumb as Souls pvp having like rules LUL
[0:33:24] <%GraceTBM> how does he work now?>
[0:33:26] <Morbidmort> @WholesomeCumiesPeddler ONly targeting one survior, even over others
[0:33:30] <Zebroneath> I wish this game had crossplay with consoles....
[0:33:34] <%Taisuru> @WholesomeCumiesPeddler Focusing down a single player and hooking them 3 times to kill them
[0:33:38] <VritraReiRei> 21 games monkaS
[0:33:41] <NHKira> Pat you gonna upload the PS5 stream?
[0:33:44] <%AnIcedCoffee> @Zebroneath crossplay is coming
[0:33:45] <ABigPinkLion> I only play killer and was amazed by how little points the survivors get
[0:33:50] <Broman97> I want Mr. X in this game. No I don‚Äôt care about the RE 4v1 game.
[0:33:55] <SomeOtherNeb> hey chat! Hey Pat, thanks for streaming earlier for EU folks
[0:33:57] <%linSP> pat has no honor and will strike a man when they bow in souls games
[0:33:58] <%spiritofmojave> that'd be a nightmare
[0:33:59] <Torgue_1> Are you gonna kill Nancy Wheeler?
[0:34:05] <Jetsfantasy> @NHKira Copyright claimed iirc
[0:34:05] <%JumboCrunchies> @PatStaresAt Didn't they already announce Crossplay was coming?
[0:34:07] <%NeoCre> @wholesomecumiespeddler Targeting a single survivor until they are dead (tunnel vision)
[0:34:08] <Specularii> Crossplay is, in fact, coming Soon‚Ñ¢
[0:34:14] <j0ustar> it's called a Mouse
[0:34:18] <+ROBOSAPION6499> hey pat do you think that RE8 is about werewolves like everyone says?
[0:34:19] <NHKira> @jetsfantasy ah, damn. ok
[0:34:24] <VritraReiRei> isn'
[0:34:27] <%Mindtrick_Matt> I think only Huntress and Gunslinger have a advantage
[0:34:27] <%Nickmobox> How's the queue times for PC?
[0:34:28] <%weissguard> Oh hey, it's that Stranger Things character.
[0:34:30] <dinnydanny777> Didn't GTA have crossplay which just lead to console players having to play with massive cheaters
[0:34:31] <%JumboCrunchies> As a PC killer player, I agree
[0:34:32] <SomeOtherNeb> oh no he's hot
[0:34:34] <%Starotter70> @NHKira I think he said he'll upload it to youtube in a day or two
[0:34:35] <%a_goth_pancake> mouselook is amazing, friend.
[0:34:37] <$OranHexthief> @Garthunox the other stuff may be arbitrary but tbh tunneling is one of those things where its boring for all involved and will just make people leave the game.
[0:34:38] <%NeoCre> Oh god, cross play would be hilarious
[0:34:41] <amiavamp> This game already has killers that do the teleport step right? So Mr. X could work
[0:34:44] <%Garthunox> Pat I'm a trapper main btw and he can see the aura if his traps and it's better to put em at chokes or vaults for maximum effectiveness
[0:34:45] <VritraReiRei> isn't it possible to use a mouse on a console or am i misunderstanding that?
[0:34:48] <ABigPinkLion> Oh boy I can't wait for that to get reverted 6 months after it's added
[0:34:55] <+tigerfang86> KINDA true?
[0:35:02] <%Valdorick> But wait... Pat... =/= Shitbag meme lord?
[0:35:02] <UnfilteredComic> LUL
[0:35:04] <ha2ken> Must play survivor...for the memes...
[0:35:05] <%heartlesshealer> crossplay with PC killers and console survivors would be hilarious
[0:35:07] <%Garthunox> of his traps*
[0:35:08] <%NeoCre> I‚Äôd say tunneling (real tunneling) is bs.
[0:35:10] <@SoFarFetched> THAT MAN IS SHIRTLESS
[0:35:12] <%Wrangler117> Bought the game a few days ago and keep getting matched with rank 3-8 survivors, why is this? I keep getting my shit pushed in
[0:35:12] <+demon1103> "look, the rules are simple. They are all down in the Survivors Rulebook for Killers......no there's not a Killers Rulebook for Survivors that nonsense hahahaha" -survivors
[0:35:13] <SummonerMagno> reminder that Paige plays survivor
[0:35:14] <madskull456> an re monster would be fun in dbd
[0:35:16] <bigbradish> I mean there are 4 survivors and 1 killer its just statistics that more of them will be an asshole
[0:35:17] <%cowardlord> yes
[0:35:19] <+chester804> yo Pat, i recently started playing this, loving it! Me and my roommate play DBD alot
[0:35:20] <dinnydanny777> They look sick tho
[0:35:20] <%Garthunox> @neocre why?
[0:35:21] <$ragingbrachy> flamelurker looks so lame
[0:35:21] <%JumboCrunchies> @Valdorick It's different. Pat is a Shitbag Meme. Not a Memelord.
[0:35:27] <%NeoCre> Thing is, a lot of the accusations are not real tunneling
[0:35:30] <Jetsfantasy> I think it's because the toxic people are attracted to the survivor because its' job is to cuck the killer
[0:35:32] <Specularii> Billy isn't a survivor LUL
[0:35:35] <dapperskeleton69> hella points
[0:35:39] <Reanimator83> !uptime
[0:35:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 35m 50s.
[0:35:42] <%SaiyanShoto> My uncle came in from out of town and refuses to wear a mask. I no long associate with that uncle
[0:35:46] <%Birdigalore> Flame lurker looks too much like smelter demon
[0:35:50] <VritraReiRei> @heartlesshealer naw, PC survivors vs console killers would be even *more* hilarious
[0:35:53] <%JumboCrunchies> Y'all figure Ghostface is worth picking up? He seems like he'd be a tonne of fun.
[0:35:55] <$LegendGHT> what does the dark mist actually affect?
[0:35:55] <%Garthunox> camping is the only actual bs thing killers can do
[0:35:55] <%spiritofmojave> nice
[0:36:01] <%Taisuru> How many Killers do you get in the base game?
[0:36:08] <%heartlesshealer> @VritraReiRei That's a gimme
[0:36:09] <%Valdorick> Survs can waste your time like whoa
[0:36:09] <%Tyndarian> Get that delter demon out
[0:36:10] <Broman97> Do a silent hill thing. Jill from either Resi 1/3, Mr X, and either the Spencer Mansion or Raccoon City
[0:36:12] <venomfury86> Storm King!!!
[0:36:14] <%Treuan> 5, it looks like. I just picked it ip
[0:36:15] <Captain_Doomsday> Is the Doctor...BETTER after his rework?
[0:36:18] <MavrickHauntX1999> Looping
[0:36:18] <Dreigun> @LegendGHT it's just ambient fog. Can make it a little harder to see
[0:36:23] <%heartlesshealer> @VritraReiRei but yeah you're right
[0:36:25] <%weissguard> Ashes, Ashes, the chainsaw goes BRRRRR
[0:36:26] <ABigPinkLion> It's generally the right way to play
[0:36:28] <Daskolin> Doctor godlike after rework
[0:36:30] <dinnydanny777> But the point is to do that
[0:36:30] <madskull456> pats just looking for the weaker survivor
[0:36:32] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Which is what everyone should be doing

[0:36:39] <dapperskeleton69> SKIN YOUR ASS RAW
[0:36:41] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I realize chasing too long can be a good distraction for the survivors to work on generators
[0:36:42] <+NitronStreams> Gotta go fast
[0:36:42] <%spiritofmojave> Form of! CHAINSAW.
[0:36:43] <boogaleeboo> That was a fucking sprint

[0:36:47] <%nmaten> chainsaw go brrrrrrr
[0:36:51] <amiavamp> Dude got caught so quick
[0:36:51] <+tigerfang86> ALMOST HAPPENED AGAIN

[0:36:54] <%Typhaeon> Crazy talk
[0:36:54] <%LtSurge> @saiyanshoto no one in my office wears a mask except me, I had 2 asthma attacks and had to get a covid because of them, fuck people who won't comply

[0:37:01] <venomfury86> Chainsaw goes brrrrrrrrr
[0:37:01] <%Taisuru> AH, FLASHLIGHT
[0:37:03] <SomeOtherNeb> YOUR ROCK HRAD ABS DO NOTHING FOR YOU NOW
[0:37:04] <%Starotter70> His nipples will block the hook
[0:37:04] <%JumboCrunchies> If you can catch the dummies, you can often bait the good players into a bad situation when they come to save them
[0:37:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> Remember Children go after the gazelle with the limp
[0:37:09] <WhitePantherZ> scared of a flashlight?
[0:37:11] <%baronblank> wtf does the flashlight do
[0:37:13] <%Pookiedaexzile> Double points if its a child
[0:37:14] <@SoFarFetched> The other day someone blinded me with a flashlight and for some reason stood there and I Smacked him blindly LUL
[0:37:21] <@SoFarFetched> Flashlight blinds the killer for a few seconds
[0:37:22] <$LegendGHT> i hate the voice acting in this game. except bruce Campbell
[0:37:25] <%JumboCrunchies> Flashlight blinds you and makes you drop the survivor.
[0:37:25] <Captain_Doomsday> It stuns the Killer and frees someone they're carrying.
[0:37:26] <%a_goth_pancake> lol gf ben
[0:37:30] <%Aydarkzero> LUL
[0:37:30] <%baronblank> oh I see, sounds like a pain
[0:37:30] <%Typhaeon> Split tunnelling is when you tunnel using a VPN Kappa
[0:37:37] <%ChestMimik> That seems like a legitimate strategy.
[0:37:37] <%Garthunox> flashlight will make the killer drop a survivor and blind them temporarily
[0:37:38] <+demon1103> you mean strategy
[0:37:42] <dinnydanny777> Tunneling sounds like bullying
[0:37:43] <%a_goth_pancake> shirtless dumbass.
[0:37:44] <MavrickHauntX1999> i do the same with Spirit and Plauge
[0:37:44] <+amiroodude> Did someone say chunnelling?
[0:37:45] <Daskolin> Witch survior with friend its the only choice
[0:37:47] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Your perk encourages not doing it though
[0:37:48] <%SovPho> Strategy is toxic @demon1103
[0:37:50] <+ararebeast> The Dead Hard!
[0:37:57] <Captain_Doomsday> Careful, that's a Sweat David.
[0:37:59] <%Treuan> Ded 'ard
[0:38:05] <j0ustar> ey batter batter, SWING
[0:38:05] <KeiPrime> aint that the action movie from seinfeld? Chunnel?
[0:38:07] <%redrins> the dbd killer rulebook by survivors explicitely states that the killer shall not tunnel for it is, as they say BM
[0:38:08] <%Starotter70> Aaaaaaaaaaaagh
[0:38:09] <%SovPho> the only acceptable course of action in a universe dependent on the entropy of choice is pure chaos
[0:38:15] <Jetsfantasy> Tunneling probably tilts them super hard too
[0:38:15] <losttrails> I've always meant to catch Pat's streams, finaaaallyy!!
[0:38:16] <Captain_Doomsday> Neon Feng and Nea and Shirtless David are BM-coded.
[0:38:17] <%DatGuyJimbo> take that wall
[0:38:23] <$LegendGHT> wait I missed it what is tunneling?
[0:38:25] <+Skelegroove> Isn't the game balance already in favor of survivors? Banning simple strategies would be silly
[0:38:32] <+SirFurther> ah yes, blind chainsaw
[0:38:33] <SomeOtherNeb> @LegendGHT focusing on 1 survivor
[0:38:33] <%a_goth_pancake> mm, juicy.
[0:38:34] <%Treuan> BAd luck
[0:38:34] <$OranHexthief> can't wait till pat realizes tunneling makes the game harder since survivors stop saving and just run away LUL
[0:38:34] <+Estuko> LUL
[0:38:35] <@SoFarFetched> well he's fucking dead
[0:38:36] <UnfilteredComic> Wow i havent played in a long time, that flashlight effect is actually good now

[0:38:37] <%WhereIsWill> wouldnt being put on a meathook at that spot kill you intantly? HahaThink HahaThink HahaThink
[0:38:38] <%SovPho> jAsON
[0:38:38] <%weissguard> OOF
[0:38:38] <Captain_Doomsday> Tunnelling is when a Killer attacks the same person more than once.
[0:38:39] <ABigPinkLion> @LegendGHT focusing one person to remove them from the game early
[0:38:39] <MrDonTacos_> LUL
[0:38:39] <dapperskeleton69> FUCKED
[0:38:39] <%Starotter70> That was unfortunate
[0:38:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> Fleshlight will make the killer tired for 40 sec
[0:38:40] <%dave323dave> LUL
[0:38:40] <j0ustar> he LOVES that hammer
[0:38:40] <Malisin_Murder> Poor guy LUL
[0:38:41] <+demon1103> @SovPho right right...better consult The Survivor Rulebook for Killers again...says I need to allow them to drop no less than 5 palletes on my head
[0:38:42] <PiCheese> LOL
[0:38:43] <%Taisuru> Poor guy
[0:38:43] <%Aydarkzero> did he escape just to get smacked?
[0:38:43] <Zeldrick> @LegendGHT Focus down one player
[0:38:44] <%heartlesshealer> dude needs to run better

[0:39:02] <@SoFarFetched> yeah hes dead now LUL
[0:39:03] <%AnIcedCoffee> And that's why survivor's all run DS
[0:39:12] <Captain_Doomsday> Oh, right, Pat skips the chat
[0:39:15] <dapperskeleton69> nancy cmon
[0:39:18] <%NeoCre> Tunneling is focusing on one survivor to the point of ignoring the others. Not simply attacking one more than once
[0:39:21] <%arcanemacrocosm> i have a friend who broke his arm on a pallet
[0:39:22] <Estel013> round and round
[0:39:23] <Captain_Doomsday> They're for SURE going to call him a tunneller.
[0:39:25] <dinnydanny777> This is sick high level play
[0:39:25] <General_Terro> imagine getting hooked 3 times in less than a min
[0:39:26] <SomeOtherNeb> EZclap
[0:39:28] <%BunnyEmperor> LUL
[0:39:32] <j0ustar> gg ez
[0:39:34] <Captain_Doomsday> Ask any Survivor and Tunnelling is attacking more than once though.

[0:40:19] <ELuscious> meddling kids
[0:40:21] <WhitePantherZ> so do the survivors get a certain amount of lives or can they be saved indefinitely?
[0:40:21] <%a_goth_pancake> I'll be leaving now

[0:40:38] <+Estuko> His enormous dick @dinnydanny777
[0:40:42] <@SoFarFetched> he should have his big sword.
[0:40:42] <%arancet> cleaver
[0:40:44] <%NeoCre> @captain_doomsday The salty mains sure. But there are survivors that aren‚Äôt pure cancer (generally those that play both sides)
[0:40:45] <%Garthunox> cleaver
[0:40:46] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> such wiggly wobbly movement
[0:40:48] <+ararebeast> Where does Pyramid Head's eyes?

[0:40:57] <j0ustar> they REALLY love Pat's mallet huh
[0:41:01] <srkAres> thats some tough-ass bamboo
[0:41:06] <%SovPho> what's the point of damaging the generators?
[0:41:11] <+SirFurther> facecam is covering the only HUD elements Kreygasm
[0:41:15] <@SoFarFetched> it starts over their progress of fixing the genrator
[0:41:21] <%SovPho> I've never played so
[0:41:30] <%Garthunox> it doesnt start it over
[0:41:36] <%a_goth_pancake> how altruistic.
[0:41:42] <dinnydanny777> uhhnn
[0:41:42] <%Garthunox> it stops it and it starts to regress
[0:41:48] <Rabicwill> hey guys how's Pat's murdering?
[0:41:48] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt Kicking gens is a waste of time without a perk. They degen at 1/4 the rate of a single survivor repairing it.
[0:41:52] <@SoFarFetched> yeah sorry not start over LUL don't know why I said that

[0:42:05] <ABigPinkLion> Entity very happy with pat
[0:42:05] <$zyberion626> Pat would make an unsettling serial killer

[0:42:07] <Malisin_Murder> Where are the other two monkaS
[0:42:16] <Ragnakawaii> So why do people hate tunneling again?
[0:42:23] <+Commiekin> tunneling is a bad strat because you wanna spread the pain to generate pressure and use injured survivors to monopolize other people's time
[0:42:26] <ABigPinkLion> PogChamp
[0:42:26] <%Scooterbug9000> anyone else notice how cute pat is?
[0:42:28] <%Rumbutt> BACKREV

[0:42:30] <%MelBrooksKA> Those tracking slashes seem really powerful
[0:42:30] <Frostydough1> "Tunneling" is such a fucking stupid term, you're a god damn killer and you're here to kill, why wouldnt you just kill whoever you can
[0:42:30] <%Garthunox> Spirit Fury btw is a perk that destroys a pallet that hits you if you destroy 4 pallets
[0:42:31] <dinnydanny777> Pat would make an obsessive serial killer because he would be obsessed with making his number go big
[0:42:32] <dapperskeleton69> man i cant believe my favorite character Nancy Wheeler from the hit netflix original series Stranger Things is dead in Dead By Daylight

[0:43:07] <jestrfestr> too bad she looks 12 in the game @dapperskeleton69
[0:43:08] <Ragnakawaii> But you lost the game, isn't that the point?
[0:43:09] <KeiPrime> hahah
[0:43:11] <%de1ete_forever> psaUp
[0:43:11] <%Valdorick> That is unfortunate.
[0:43:14] <KeiPrime> that was pretty good
[0:43:16] <%SovPho> @ScreamLord Swamp thing
[0:43:16] <%BunnyEmperor> entity very pleased
[0:43:16] <ThorW> @Ragnakawaii because at times when you get unhooked you have no choice in being safe or not and you don't get to play the game because your teammate unhooked in the killer's face
[0:43:23] <SomeOtherNeb> actual self-sacrifice, huh
[0:43:24] <%SovPho> no that's Woolie nevermind.
[0:43:26] <WhitePantherZ> does pat win now?

[0:44:10] <%Dustwalker44> @PatStaresAt Will you be trying Freddie today?
[0:44:12] <%Garthunox> I can give big tips
[0:44:12] <+Commiekin> do not do the boring clown man
[0:44:13] <zeif00> Doctor is good
[0:44:14] <jestrfestr> should clown around
[0:44:15] <%SvenHolgersson> Use your influencer powers to make him come out faster UGHHHHHH
[0:44:15] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt Kicking gens is a waste of time without a perk. They degen at 1/4 the rate of a single survivor repairing it.
[0:44:16] <dinnydanny777> What is he holding
[0:44:17] <MyNameIsRasus> When they addin' Bugsnax tho
[0:44:19] <%heartlesshealer> Pat is playing to save up for Pyramid Head stuff when he comes out
[0:44:22] <MavrickHauntX1999> or Demogorgon
[0:44:22] <EuropanLamprey> How many rage messages have Pat got so far?
[0:44:28] <%NeoCre> MA BOI
[0:44:31] <KeiPrime> thats dont look like much of a doctor's implement
[0:44:32] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Estel013 there is a point in game where tunneling depips you
[0:44:35] <+Skelex> tunneling is how you would deal with enemies in any other video game, why would you not use an effective strategy here?
[0:44:37] <MrDonTacos_> forsenCD
[0:44:40] <%Scooterbug9000> spam his ability and the survivors cant do anything
[0:44:41] <SpoopyNupers> Do you like pyramid heads perks pat
[0:44:45] <+Commiekin> doctor isn't even that good, he just annoys survivors the most
[0:44:45] <%marvel877> Pop goes the weasel cause the weasel goes pop.
[0:44:54] <FlongBongle> Sooo Doctor is just Josef Mengele then?
[0:44:54] <zeif00> Pop, Thrilling, STBFL, Discordance
[0:44:54] <bepno> what is he holding?
[0:44:55] <@SoFarFetched> @Skelex I assume it s the ""WHY ME AND NOT THE OTHER PERSON"
[0:44:56] <+TheHiGHDOLMaSTER> Yeah Doc is just king of annoyance
[0:45:00] <TomFrank> @PatStaresAt do you like the wraith? hes my fav
[0:45:06] <FerwhateverDota> Will you ever play survivor ?
[0:45:07] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Skelex latter in the game tunneling depids you
[0:45:09] <ThorW> Doctor is actually a top tier killer
[0:45:09] <%ChestMimik> I don't think that ma. lis a licensed medical professional
[0:45:12] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Basically lol
[0:45:17] <%Garthunox> when is the bugsnax monstrosity getting added?
[0:45:17] <+Commiekin> @Skelex Because it's not effective. You *want* survivors to be alive and injured because then they need other survivors to help. Plus you should be hooking and getting into your next chase super quick.
[0:45:21] <%NeoCre> @scooterbug9000 if they go to tier 3 and snap out, they drop all the way back to tier 1 now
[0:45:21] <jestrfestr> everyone gets those
[0:45:23] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Doctor's addons make him extremely good now
[0:45:23] <dapperskeleton69> doc is the king of "oh you wanted to play the game? sorry"
[0:45:26] <%WheatlyXT> What does the doc even do?
[0:45:28] <%de1ete_forever> angel of mercy
[0:45:34] <+chester804> my roommate told me the eye color cosmetics are halloween stuff
[0:45:34] <MyNameIsRasus> That electricity looked terrible
[0:45:36] <+ararebeast> People keep saying tunneling is an "effective strategy" but the game actively deincentivizes it by giving less blood points
[0:45:37] <%Starotter70> So what's Tunneling?
[0:45:38] <dinnydanny777> I bet Bugsnax is a horror game
[0:45:39] <%mollymostly> I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school
[0:45:40] <+Estuko> He laughs like the Lego Skeletons from the LEGO WORLDS game Hahaha
[0:45:42] <%BunnyEmperor> he looks like a funny fella
[0:45:43] <KeiPrime> the famous doctor's instrument, the stick
[0:45:44] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt double iredecent is literally GG
[0:45:44] <zeif00> He got semi reworked in the last year yeah?
[0:45:46] <%a_goth_pancake> I live the hospital map tho.
[0:45:50] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt NOT calm, that's for a specific build
[0:45:50] <%Garthunox> @starotter70 focusing on one survivor
[0:45:51] <+Commiekin> Like ideally hook -> Chase some one -> Third goes to rescue, now you've got 3 people doing nothing at all
[0:45:58] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt If you time his power right and shock survivors they can't use a pallet or window because they're screaming
[0:45:58] <%Starotter70> @Garthunox Gotcha, thanks
[0:46:09] <%NeoCre> Doctor has gotten a lot better after the rework at stopping loops
[0:46:11] <MyNameIsRasus> Are Add Ons consumables
[0:46:11] <%Treuan> The add-ons are consumables?
[0:46:14] <Broman97> @patstaresat who would you prefer as a Resi DBD candidate. Mr. X or Nemesis?
[0:46:14] <amiavamp> This reminds me of being able to have playable facehuggers in Aliens vs Predator 2 multiplayer...you want a multiplayer game full of jump scares that's one
[0:46:15] <dinnydanny777> Nice
[0:46:18] <venomfury86> Max's reaction to Kena was funny as shit
[0:46:19] <$ragingbrachy> because theyre screaming
[0:46:19] <%Scooterbug9000> thats what makes him opo
[0:46:23] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt You will get flamed for double iredecent. That is broken
[0:46:24] <%houhilburn> If you time the shock just the right way, survivors cant pallet drop you
[0:46:24] <Zombrocom> Wha Ha Ha Ha
[0:46:28] <%maenos2> I have doubts about this doctor's credentials
[0:46:29] <+TheHiGHDOLMaSTER> you hit them with the ranged shock
[0:46:29] <+Skelex> This is why I don't play online games at all, I have no patience for people telling me I'm playing a game wrong
[0:46:31] <$ragingbrachy> 4Head
[0:46:31] <%Garthunox> shocking them
[0:46:34] <%Scooterbug9000> makle them scream
[0:46:35] <+TheHiGHDOLMaSTER> right before they drop it
[0:46:39] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Use m2 before they get to pallet
[0:46:40] <dapperskeleton69> shockie zappy
[0:46:41] <Floofiie> People flaming you for winning LUL
[0:46:41] <+Commiekin> His shock therapy attack prevents survivors from taking action for about a second after it hits them
[0:46:41] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt As the survivor goes toward a loop, you charge the shcok on them and they can't use it
[0:46:41] <+chester804> Static blast is pretty cool, Doc is my roommates favororite killer
[0:46:43] <dinnydanny777> This doctor seems like a quack
[0:46:45] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Scream animation
[0:46:45] <%SvenHolgersson> Pat which of the Monsters are the sexiest
[0:46:46] <zeif00> What perks you got for this boi?
[0:46:47] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt You time the shock so they get hit when they're about to go through the pallet so they can't drop it
[0:46:47] <%Mindtrick_Matt> @ThorW I love playing survivor and having doctors do that. Waste so much time while I loop and can still throw the pallet cause I'm not dumb
[0:46:48] <SpoopyNupers> his electic ability
[0:46:49] <%MajorCrasher> you shock then right before they vault
[0:46:50] <dapperskeleton69> SHOCKINV
[0:46:51] <@SoFarFetched> @Skelex well chats are post match so you can always skip looking at the chat.
[0:46:56] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt They locked in animation
[0:47:00] <+pectusumbra> hello! Have I missed anything, or are we just starting?
[0:47:04] <Gutsandlove> shocking the survivors removes promps for them
[0:47:06] <%NeoCre> His m2 cases stun for several seconds
[0:47:14] <+Commiekin> It's not just the animation, they can't do vaults or drop pallets for about an additional second or two.
[0:47:17] <%PlagueOfGripes> your doctor's clothing is pedestrian
[0:47:17] <ThorW> @Mindtrick_Matt then you're playing vs bad doctors
[0:47:18] <%Scooterbug9000> just starting @pectusumbra
[0:47:21] <Gutsandlove> 2 secs
[0:47:22] <%Typhaeon> I've been wiki-diving this, and the lore for a lot of characters could be so much better
[0:47:24] <$OranHexthief> the shock is a more active form of the blood pool freddy has pat
[0:47:25] <+Hapsam> Hapsam subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:47:26] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt about 2 seconds yeah
[0:47:26] <%Starotter70> @pectusumbra 2 matches so far, won the first, lost the second
[0:47:27] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt 1.5-2 depends on survior
[0:47:31] <unstabledannyll> Is this the first time he's playing him?
[0:47:32] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Its like 1 second not several
[0:47:34] <%Typhaeon> They're like 3/4 of the way to being well written
[0:47:35] <%Garthunox> doc is able to have a very thin extremely long shock range if you use the proper addons
[0:47:45] <%Starotter70> @pectusumbra *Lost the first, Won the second
[0:47:46] <Rabicwill> Is the Predator a playable killer in this game? if not that would be a sick character
[0:47:50] <+pectusumbra> got ya
[0:47:50] <+Elemntion> Billy?
[0:47:50] <dinnydanny777> Doctor Who has taken a darker turn
[0:47:56] <+pectusumbra> predator is not in, no
[0:47:58] <%Garthunox> predator has his own game
[0:47:58] <$ragingbrachy> üëè
[0:48:00] <+Commiekin> @Rabicwill No, and probably not since they have their own game
[0:48:04] <%PlagueOfGripes> ah yes, rework doctor
[0:48:06] <+ItsAGundamu> oh we got L4D characters here?
[0:48:06] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt You can stack Discipline addons to make the delay of his shock practically instant now
[0:48:06] <ThorW> He'
[0:48:07] <%PlagueOfGripes> Dr. Rework
[0:48:09] <Torgue_1> Surgeon?
[0:48:09] <%de1ete_forever> agent 47
[0:48:10] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I've noticed a concerning lack of The Mo. Where it the Scream Baby?
[0:48:11] <ThorW> He's way way better now
[0:48:12] <%SvenHolgersson> STOP HITTING US
[0:48:17] <Gutsandlove> i still want a robot killer
[0:48:18] <sexdrugsvideogames> I see Pat has no RTX audio...
[0:48:20] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Your CTRL is big aoe madness with scream
[0:48:21] <zeif00> His power flows a lot better now

[0:49:19] <TomFrank> thanks bro :)

[0:49:30] <@SoFarFetched> But then that'd be a weird thought that you'd be upset that Eli won't impregnate you. Cause he's now your brother.
[0:49:32] <zarbudda77> that makes me feel better
[0:49:34] <%TheFramedWarlock> Hey boys
[0:49:36] <zeif00> Whispers is a great perk
[0:49:42] <%TheFramedWarlock> Is this big booty pyramidhead ?
[0:49:43] <%a_goth_pancake> just park that bus right on top of him.
[0:49:47] <MyNameIsRasus> His laugh sounds cool
[0:49:52] <%MajorCrasher> it does that without whispers
[0:49:56] <+Commiekin> Whispers is an incredible perk. Once you get a feel for the distance, you can completely rule out whole structures and not waste time
[0:49:58] <%AnIcedCoffee> Precook it
[0:49:59] <+Estuko> DESTROY CHILD
[0:50:00] <Gutsandlove> yup
[0:50:09] <zeif00> A lot of people run Iron Will nowadays so i like to run Whispers
[0:50:09] <%PlagueOfGripes> wrong way
[0:50:09] <%chambatron> Are they aware that he used the ability?
[0:50:11] <ABigPinkLion> Wow, that's the doctors base ability?! are his other stats garbage to compensate?
[0:50:13] <%Scooterbug9000> oof
[0:50:21] <%a_goth_pancake> attempts were made.
[0:50:29] <dinnydanny777> Oh that's what that stick is I couldn't tell

[0:50:46] <ThorW> @Mindtrick_Matt again you're playing vs bad doctors if that's what they do. Check out ArchDruidDrey at some point to see a very good doctor deny loops
[0:50:47] <madskull456> Bills here

[0:50:56] <%SovPho> wtf is m4
[0:50:57] <+Commiekin> @ABigPinkLion It's not that strong at all. There's so many ways to find survivors.
[0:50:59] <%houhilburn> BIIIILLLLL
[0:51:00] <%Garthunox> science rules
[0:51:00] <%a_goth_pancake> what's got Billy so spooked?
[0:51:00] <Alexisonfires> Did I dreamt Pat had a stream yesterday on the PS5 launch? But when I woke up, the VOD for yesterday was gone? Pls tell me I‚Äôm not going crazy? HahaDoge
[0:51:03] <+UltraViolet371> Paige didn't play DeS, right? She went straight from BB to Dark Souls?
[0:51:08] <%PlagueOfGripes> He just wanted to smoke and die quietly on his porch
[0:51:12] <@SoFarFetched> @Alexisonfires Pat didn't put up a VOD
[0:51:15] <%Garthunox> @alexisonfires he did not upload a vod
[0:51:21] <SomeOtherNeb> @Alexisonfires it's not on Twitch but will be on Youtube because DMCAs
[0:51:22] <%thelonechris> VOD was probably deleted due to music
[0:51:32] <%Frost_Quill> @Alexisonfires Streamers couldn't keep the VOD, it'll go up on youtube soon.
[0:51:32] <sexdrugsvideogames> Pats PS5 stream was too violent and was taken down by twitch
[0:51:33] <%BunnyEmperor> you missed one to the left
[0:51:37] <+absolutely_naught> someone went to get hooked guy
[0:51:37] <+Mittastic> @Alexisonfires he said he turned off VOD yesterday as a test
[0:51:48] <+Estuko> Holy shit seeing himself there scared tf out of me LUL I wasn't expecting it
[0:51:49] <+ararebeast> Even the Doctor sees fake madness doctors???
[0:52:01] <ABigPinkLion> @Commiekin that's nutso there must be a catch for that much info gathering?
[0:52:06] <ThorW> @ararebeast It lets the doctor track survivors, if you see one then a survivor was there
[0:52:08] <%PlagueOfGripes> I'm not sure if this guy is an actual doctor
[0:52:09] <%AncelDeLambert> ooohhh, how sad for you
[0:52:13] <%PlagueOfGripes> he acts more like a police officer
[0:52:15] <+Mittastic> very good
[0:52:20] <+ararebeast> Oooh kinda like Oni's blood bubbles, neat! @ThorW
[0:52:22] <+Commiekin> @ABigPinkgLion Doesn't need to be. Compare it to like, Oni with Infectious Fright. He's just not that strong.
[0:52:23] <%Mindtrick_Matt> If they stand there like a dummy its good lol
[0:52:23] <%Scooterbug9000> VERY NICE HOW MUCH?
[0:52:24] <Frostydough1> LUL
[0:52:27] <SomeOtherNeb> but his name is DOCTOR, why would he lie
[0:52:29] <dinnydanny777> It's so weird how none of these characters know how to throw
[0:52:30] <srkAres> hes got a phd
[0:52:31] <+Skelegroove> Doctorate in music theory
[0:52:32] <Riorii> Did he say when he‚Äôs uploading the vod to YouTube?
[0:52:32] <Daebunz> hes about as qualified as dr mario
[0:52:33] <Alexisonfires> @sofarfetched @someotherneb oh I see LUL I literally fall asleep halfway from exhaustion at work, so I thought I dreamt the stream when the I checked for the VoD and it was no where to be found. Hope it‚Äôs on YT soon I want to see it from Pats perspective LUL
[0:52:34] <%thelonechris> He's got an online degree
[0:52:34] <Captain_Doomsday> He is a real doctor, but from olden days
[0:52:36] <Ragnakawaii> what college did he graduate from?
[0:52:36] <%CrazyMedicine> Maybe he is
[0:52:39] <%Garthunox> We already have a cop in the game, Pig
[0:52:40] <%Typhaeon> He's some weird, poorly-explained CIA interrogator from a Cold War black site
[0:52:45] <ShichiNoBushi> I susptect he hasn't taken the Oath.
[0:52:46] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes *Badum-pish*
[0:52:48] <%Typhaeon> One of the weaker backstories
[0:52:52] <Solidnick18> what
[0:52:53] <%houhilburn> God read the lore you losers
[0:52:55] <%ChestMimik> Why does this guy get to bw a doctor but TF2's Medic doesn't?
[0:52:59] <Captain_Doomsday> To be fair, the lore sucks
[0:53:02] <+ararebeast> Somsone is failing to snap out of it over there
[0:53:02] <%NeoCre> He is in fact not a doctor. He did torture for the CIA
[0:53:03] <MyNameIsRasus> BILL BILL BILL BILL
[0:53:03] <+Commiekin> I mean he's pretty well explained. He's from MK Ultra, went nuts, shocked everyone to death.
[0:53:04] <%Starotter70> BILL
[0:53:06] <+Mittastic> BILL BILL BILL BILL
[0:53:08] <+pyrojack6> i read the lore actual doctor turned CIA torturer
[0:53:09] <dinnydanny777> He got a doctorate from an Internet college
[0:53:10] <%houhilburn> @captain_doomsday that's no excuse
[0:53:12] <%AncelDeLambert> how much does The Doctor worry about looping?
[0:53:14] <%BoneofMalkav> Bill Nye the Science Guy
[0:53:15] <SomeOtherNeb> @Alexisonfires yeah he said in the pre-show that he'd put up a VOD on Youtube and nothing else because Twitch is being extra fucky with copyrights
[0:53:17] <+Commiekin> He IS a doctor. His professor recruited him into the CIA.
[0:53:19] <madskull456> everythings going to hell in a hand basket
[0:53:24] <Captain_Doomsday> "Being a DbD player is suffering"
[0:53:29] <%Scooterbug9000> xD
[0:53:30] <%Typhaeon> The problem is it's a very rough outline of him
[0:53:35] <venomfury86> i like the lore of the Japanese ghost girl
[0:53:39] <+Estuko> Bill (and ted's) excellent adventure!

[0:54:00] <Rabicwill> bill in the basement
[0:54:02] <thwak> ohh a double
[0:54:06] <Captain_Doomsday> Her dad went nuts and did a lotta katana murder. Murder rage is hereditary, says retcon Oni
[0:54:07] <ThorW> all of em pog
[0:54:08] <dapperskeleton69> ah yes my favorite character quote, AAAAHHHHHH
[0:54:12] <Daebunz> this character seems cool
[0:54:13] <Zombrocom> Huhuhahahahaha
[0:54:16] <%Scooterbug9000> told you doctor was op
[0:54:20] <$ragingbrachy> this killer rules
[0:54:21] <Zombrocom> What a cheerful lad
[0:54:22] <%NeoCre> What a terrible night for a curse....
[0:54:22] <+pectusumbra> So is that detection a doctor thing or a perk you put on doctor?
[0:54:24] <%a_goth_pancake> @patstaresat rap career starts here?
[0:54:29] <%Nickmobox> You have fallen for a classic blunder
[0:54:30] <ha2ken> Doctor laugh go huehuehuehue
[0:54:31] <vilelee> love that crazy laugh
[0:54:34] <Captain_Doomsday> Hey, Pat's using Whispers!
[0:54:37] <%SovPho> Do them dirty in front of they squadf
[0:54:37] <+ararebeast> You can't see it from Pat's end but the doctor shocking also makes gen progress much harder because it messes with the skill checks
[0:54:40] <vilelee> hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
[0:54:43] <Elsewize> Claudette probably has the best downed scream.
[0:54:47] <%Garthunox> you're truckin
[0:54:49] <$ragingbrachy> its a laugh-riot
[0:54:49] <+Terran_Gell> Gross
[0:54:50] <FlongBongle> Doctor is OP apparently
[0:54:55] <%NeoCre> @pectusumbra detection is in his base kit. It‚Äôs his main strength
[0:54:57] <ScreamLord> Bill's scream sounds like someone trying to imitate an iconic, classic scream. Like the Wilhelm
[0:54:58] <+Commiekin> @pectusumbra Doctor's power does that. There's a perk that does something similar (Infectious Fright) when you down survivors.
[0:54:59] <%Scooterbug9000> everytime they miss a skillcheck trying to get sane you can see them too
[0:55:02] <+pectusumbra> cool
[0:55:03] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt That`s why doctor is good. If surviors not on comms or don`t have calm spirit doctor is hard to deal with
[0:55:06] <+Mittastic> oh BILL
[0:55:08] <Estel013> ohhh Bill

[0:58:07] <FlongBongle> Is the lightning infinite?
[0:58:13] <amiavamp> do pallets respawn?

[0:58:22] <%Garthunox> no
[0:58:22] <+ararebeast> Pallets do not respawn, no

[0:59:19] <%Nickmobox> Finally a Zapping system worth a damn
[0:59:24] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt They also cant hop windows or pallets
[0:59:35] <+Commiekin> @houhilburn My man's didn't go to Dick Shock University to just be "a doctor". He's an artist
[0:59:41] <%NeoCre> @valdorick increase their insanity, stop them from interacting with thing for 2.5 sec
[0:59:42] <+ararebeast> @Valdorick THey scream and go into madness, which makes their objectives harder and eventually makes them feel they're always being followed.
[0:59:50] <%WheatlyXT> Yomi is the Japanese word for reading the opponents mind
[0:59:50] <+taltalheights> They really expect you to have no patience
[0:59:56] <%houhilburn> @commiekin he's *The* Doctor
[0:59:59] <Elsewize> Doc got a rework, no? He seems much better.
[1:00:00] <Captain_Doomsday> Pat that's a REAL tunnel.
[1:00:08] <%Bailey__gaming> i like that electricity thing
[1:00:09] <%a_goth_pancake> they really didn't expect you to have this cool lightning.
[1:00:10] <%NeoCre> @elsewize he did
[1:00:14] <%ChestMimik> First name "The" last name "Doctor"
[1:00:18] <+Commiekin> pat that was such a free hit you passed up to go get looped
[1:00:21] <Captain_Doomsday> Turning away from the guy right there to pursue the unhookee will get you DSed.
[1:00:22] <%houhilburn> Tunnelling? More like Chunnelling!
[1:00:26] <+pectusumbra> Dr. Acula
[1:00:27] <dinnydanny777> Does the lightning work if they can't see you
[1:00:30] <losttrails> Hey so is there a reason Pat always stops to break the pallets? I have no idea how to play dis gam
[1:00:33] <amiavamp> Pat just channeling his inner Volgin over here
[1:00:34] <+Mittastic> Doctor's only weakness is apple
[1:00:35] <%Typhaeon> Bye bye, baby
[1:00:42] <+bugz_munny> Pallets are one and done
[1:00:42] <dinnydanny777> That's crazy
[1:00:43] <%Valdorick> Aw, nice try, lady.
[1:00:47] <Captain_Doomsday> There's a perk that lets people reset pallets, so it's often worth breaking them.
[1:00:48] <venomfury86> it's like the doctor is using a plasmid from Bioshock
[1:00:48] <jestrfestr> other guys gonna camp hatch
[1:00:51] <jestrfestr> callin it
[1:00:53] <%QuadraticGravity> @losttrails the pallets don't regenerate, it's a limited resource
[1:00:54] <%Frost_Quill> @losttrails It removes them from the match forever.
[1:00:57] <%DatGuyJimbo> you also get points
[1:01:01] <%BunnyEmperor> theres the hatch
[1:01:03] <comedeity> he's by hatch?
[1:01:03] <Captain_Doomsday> Can't vault if you shock them, Pat.
[1:01:07] <losttrails> Aaa gotcha! So might as well get em outta the way! The more you know <3
[1:01:08] <+Commiekin> When it comes to pallets, you need to learn which pallets aren't worth the time (and also break pallets so as to force survivors to run towards dead zones)
[1:01:13] <+taltalheights> Lack or patience, lack of patients
[1:01:13] <%de1ete_forever> kill da humon
[1:01:19] <ThorW> Some pallets are on really small walls and you could leave up, they're easy to catch survivors at
[1:01:22] <%houhilburn> Good pun
[1:01:25] <Zombrocom> What, are you supposed to ignore the injured guy because the uninjured guy is slightly closer? Because "Rules"?
[1:01:26] <$insaneintentionsyo> rawrThink
[1:01:33] <%MajorCrasher> some of the doctor's perks create illusionary pallets after they've been destroyed too
[1:01:40] <Josef_Stryker> Which killer is Pat using?
[1:01:47] <%NeoCre> Dacta
[1:01:51] <%Scooterbug9000> hes going fpor the hatch
[1:01:51] <+StooEsq> sounds like a fun perk
[1:01:53] <Josef_Stryker> Thanks
[1:01:54] <venomfury86> The Doctor
[1:01:55] <Captain_Doomsday> @Zombrocom 90% because "Rules", 10% Decisive Strike.

[1:03:11] <Bullet_In_Chronostasis> streamer pic

[1:03:25] <Captain_Doomsday> Voice acting would be effort.
[1:03:27] <%WheatlyXT> Is his gimmick being two people at once?
[1:03:32] <reaper91194> There needs to be a survivor to tell the legend of Pat

[1:03:57] <sexdrugsvideogames> can he you call you the phone?
[1:03:59] <+jacintafor> he stalks people\
[1:03:59] <%walternatorz> what kind of character is based on staring??
[1:04:00] <%a_goth_pancake> he has an expos√©
[1:04:03] <ThorW> I mean if the survivors are not paying attention the 1 shot is nice... but yeah ghostface is kinda meh
[1:04:04] <EldritchNeko> hey pat you probably already talked about this but what are your thoughts on demons souls remake??
[1:04:04] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[1:04:05] <ShichiNoBushi> How's that different from Michael Mires?
[1:04:07] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Can you guess where I am, Cindy?
[1:04:07] <+Terran_Gell> Hey Pat! New quests, new Nightwave , and new Warframe. @PatStaresAt
[1:04:14] <Elsewize> mhm
[1:04:21] <ABigPinkLion> Makes sense thanks @PatStaresAt
[1:04:24] <+ararebeast> You're supposed to be able to break Ghostface out of it by looking at him but it almost never works
[1:04:25] <%Starotter70> Apparently Shaman King is coming back
[1:04:29] <Captain_Doomsday> Ghostface is generally superior to Myers.
[1:04:31] <venomfury86> oh look, it's the guy from Scary Movie Kappa
[1:04:31] <%DatGuyJimbo> ghostface should have the ability to call a survivor if he watches them long enough which stuns them
[1:04:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Does the stack keep the same level if you change targets?
[1:04:32] <ThorW> You can kinda build it up right in their face
[1:04:36] <Captain_Doomsday> But has a larger standing terror radius.
[1:04:38] <%AnIcedCoffee> only at tier 1 which you can get out of really quick
[1:04:39] <+pectusumbra> He also does a thing where he gets an obsession and it keeps passing around when people rescue the obsession
[1:04:41] <$Quiet__Viking> the key to ghost face 99% you stalk meter on survivors then use it in chase to 1 hit them
[1:04:44] <Srthunda> It almost never works because it used to work to well
[1:04:55] <%Mittastic> ghost face is edgier so that makes him better
[1:04:56] <%Tyndarian> Can Pat take the cop next? Errr clown, I mean the clown that throws gas
[1:04:57] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Twitch streamer otzdarva have good guide on him on youtube
[1:05:09] <%Dementedpenguin> I just use Ghostface as a radar.
[1:05:11] <+PR0swagonist> is pyramid head out yet or not yet?
[1:05:11] <%SvenHolgersson> How does it feel to kill people with Live Action Shaggy
[1:05:19] <DaKnightWarrior> not yet
[1:05:20] <%SvenHolgersson> Imagine the power he must yield
[1:05:21] <%Garthunox> @tyndarian the cop is pig
[1:05:21] <%Treuan> Huh. I thought that was Mike's stick, but then I don't play the game
[1:05:23] <+PR0swagonist> ah
[1:05:23] <ABigPinkLion> So does he have the red glowy like the other killers?
[1:05:30] <ABigPinkLion> 'cause that'd give him away a lot
[1:05:39] <%AnIcedCoffee> Even 99ing injured survivors and leaving them is good
[1:05:43] <ThorW> The thunderous clap of Pyramid Head's asscheeks are coming soon
[1:05:46] <Rabicwill> the key to ghostface is cold calling your opponent
[1:05:52] <$Masamune195> thought I saw people playing pyramid head already. was that some sort of early access?
[1:05:58] <%QuadraticGravity> @Masamune195 ye
[1:06:03] <$Masamune195> ah
[1:06:04] <%Starotter70> What if one of the future killers is a giant toilet?
[1:06:04] <Captain_Doomsday> All Killers have the red Stain in a chase, but they're not in a chase if they're stealthed.
[1:06:04] <%WheatlyXT> What does Pyramid Head do?
[1:06:07] <ABigPinkLion> @Masamune195 probably test server
[1:06:09] <%Dementedpenguin> @Masamune195 ptb.
[1:06:10] <%Mittastic> knife
[1:06:12] <%muskyfaux> Queue times are the real enemies
[1:06:13] <kirbyofdark> hi
[1:06:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat, which RE villain would you rather be in this game?
[1:06:17] <sexdrugsvideogames> always ask them what their favorite horror movie is
[1:06:25] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt the red glow is really important. Good survivors use it to measure killer distance and know when to dead hard or throw a pallet etc
[1:06:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Sloppy is MEAN on an instadown guy. Good.
[1:06:30] <%houhilburn> How do you beat ghost face? Good *Call*outs!
[1:06:31] <%Dementedpenguin> @Masamune195 a way of public testing the killer before his official release
[1:06:39] <Zombrocom> Ehh
[1:06:39] <Tselveydarksoul> What does Pat think of the RE 8 trailer?
[1:06:42] <fuji_92> imagine nemie in dbd
[1:06:50] <Captain_Doomsday> Sloppy makes healing take longer.
[1:06:55] <Captain_Doomsday> And doesn't leave until fully healed.
[1:06:56] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Longer to heal off the hook
[1:07:00] <+Infernal_Dalek> harder to pick up
[1:07:05] <Reizie_Etherealm> Oh shit they've got STONKS
[1:07:09] <ThorW> Makes it so survivors waste time if they want to heal and they're longer to heal if you slug
[1:07:09] <Captain_Doomsday> So picking someone up takes longer.
[1:07:15] <Sirtimbob> Pat can you explain the point of moonwalking?
[1:07:20] <%QuadraticGravity> until they finally get a heal
[1:07:20] <MyNameIsRasus> OH SHIT HERE COMES STONKS
[1:07:20] <%Frost_Quill> Until they heal all the way.
[1:07:25] <madskull456> leave on ground?
[1:07:32] <ThorW> As long as they'er injured they have sloppy on you
[1:07:34] <KaiserMario> MAn... why isn't Candyman in this...
[1:07:39] <ToneBacas> Pat boy is tired
[1:07:40] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Sloppy also affects healing from the dying state
[1:07:57] <%Starotter70> OH GOD, now I want a horror movie that's just an evil, sentient Toilet with teeth!
[1:08:00] <ABigPinkLion> I've only pulled off the moonwalk once, but it's a great tip in general
[1:08:03] <Rabicwill> @KaiserMario dude that would be sick
[1:08:04] <ToneBacas> it's all mindgames basically
[1:08:08] <EMP_SaltyMan> oh ok a fake out then
[1:08:10] <%GarbageNirvana> We call that the "Smooth Criminal"
[1:08:13] <%DedlokPM> rooPeek
[1:08:14] <ha2ken> They should create a moonwalking killer
[1:08:21] <Sirtimbob> Thanks pat!
[1:08:35] <Malisin_Murder> @Starotter70 And the toilet would be called Pat
[1:08:40] <%boomstickery> lol bet he shata brick
[1:08:41] <+pectusumbra> It's a shame ghostface doesn't get a phone
[1:08:41] <%Scooterbug9000> rip

[1:09:20] <%Dementedpenguin> It's super weird seeing a ghostface killer stalk you from a distance without the terror heartbeat LUL

[1:09:25] <ha2ken> Do the creep
[1:09:28] <DaKnightWarrior> HEY pick up the phone

[1:09:40] <SummonerMagno> wwwaaaazzzzzzaaaaaaaaappppp
[1:09:45] <Rabicwill> Finally, you can play as Matthew Lillard in this game
[1:09:51] <%PlagueOfGripes> ghostface seems like the killer for rascals

[1:10:19] <+pectusumbra> that's the marks of a survivor
[1:10:26] <jestrfestr> LUL
[1:10:27] <+pectusumbra> pat can follow that to hunt people
[1:10:32] <Captain_Doomsday> Can't you disable autoaim?
[1:10:38] <%Dementedpenguin> @CappuccinoGuil if survivors run, they leave a trail that the killer can follow
[1:10:39] <Jetsfantasy> @Ellila Ghostface I believe
[1:10:40] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Kkigomm
[1:10:48] <venomfury86> ghostface
[1:10:48] <%Frost_Quill> @CappuccinoGuil The killer would have NO chance without them showing the trail. Only when you enter a chase with them I think.
[1:10:53] <+bugz_munny> that guy is not having a good time lol
[1:10:55] <dapperskeleton69> what's ghostface's deal?
[1:10:56] <Captain_Doomsday> Hm.

[1:11:20] <ergulor> That was fantastic
[1:11:20] <Tselveydarksoul> And here is where I'd get hate for going after the injured survivor NotLikeThis
[1:11:21] <%king_wragles> Came in to see a perfect moonwalk

[1:11:39] <Rabicwill> @KaiserMario Genuinely tho, imagine hearing those bees buzzing behind you as he gets closer
[1:11:40] <Fep3> LUL
[1:11:42] <%WheatlyXT> Yomi is the Japanese word for reading the mind of the opponent.
[1:11:51] <%ChestMimik> Do the survivors have different tech like the killers or are they just skins?
[1:11:51] <sexdrugsvideogames> i wish the guards in mgs could moonwalk
[1:11:53] <deaddogsinrivers> Is Pat playing Spy in TF2 right now?
[1:11:57] <+JavaManJoJo> Does anything special happen if you get all four survivors on the basement hooks?
[1:12:00] <bluefooddye1> abusing broken mechanics, also known as a tactic Kappa
[1:12:02] <Captain_Doomsday> Survivors are just skins.
[1:12:08] <Specularii> Gens go fast if you don't pressure them, whoda thunk
[1:12:11] <$Dakuu75> This killer cleans his blade by grabbing the knife with his hands. That shit bugs me every time, lol.
[1:12:19] <DaKnightWarrior> I love how chill pat is today.
[1:12:20] <Captain_Doomsday> That's from the movies!
[1:12:20] <Fep3> survivors are just functions
[1:12:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Where's the WAZZAAAAAAAAAP ability?
[1:12:25] <%Frost_Quill> @Dakuu75 He did it in the movie.
[1:12:26] <deaddogsinrivers> Is this game even fun as a victim?

[1:12:56] <%AnIcedCoffee> that was a really good head on play
[1:13:00] <wyrdboy21121> alt f4 if it was me
[1:13:04] <%Frost_Quill> @Dakuu75 Ghostface from Scream.
[1:13:07] <Malisin_Murder> What just happened?
[1:13:09] <%DensityD> it's alllllllllllll good
[1:13:16] <eco419> LUL
[1:13:18] <Captain_Doomsday> Technically, this isn't Ghostface from Scream.
[1:13:21] <ABigPinkLion> Time to camp
[1:13:22] <+Scevda> gurl
[1:13:25] <ThorW> @Malisin_Murder dwight has a perk called head on that staggers the killer when you jump out of a locker
[1:13:25] <Captain_Doomsday> They didn't have the character license, but the MASK license.
[1:13:30] <vilelee> credit where it's due, that was a good move
[1:13:31] <jestrfestr> its all ogre
[1:13:33] <+bugz_munny> didnt the original ghostface explode?
[1:13:39] <%Dementedpenguin> Head On - Survivor perk that allows you to daze the killer and, if he's carrying a survivor, drop the,
[1:13:39] <xiccy> psaHoldon
[1:13:41] <Malisin_Murder> @ThorW Ohhh thank you
[1:13:42] <+bugz_munny> I havent seen scream in years
[1:13:43] <Captain_Doomsday> Every Ghostface from the movies is dead.
[1:13:44] <%king_wragles> Crouched in a corner actually works?
[1:13:45] <%Dementedpenguin> *them
[1:13:48] <%heartlesshealer> she was in the locker? LUL
[1:13:49] <MavrickHauntX1999> ??
[1:13:50] <sexdrugsvideogames> this is a legally distinct version of the killer from scream
[1:13:55] <Srthunda> thats toxic
[1:13:55] <%Dementedpenguin> *if they're in a locker
[1:13:59] <%DatGuyJimbo> she was crouching literally in the corner
[1:14:02] <%DatGuyJimbo> on the stairs
[1:14:06] <%de1ete_forever> good old buck knife
[1:14:17] <sexdrugsvideogames> there is still the killer from "Stab"
[1:14:39] <+bugz_munny> WHENS BYE BYE MAN
[1:14:39] <Rabicwill> There should be a skin for Ghostface that's just Matthew Lillard
[1:14:40] <Captain_Doomsday> Seeing someone have fun playing DbD is surreal. Otz is the closest I'd seen before and he's tired now.
[1:14:41] <%DensityD> woosh
[1:14:47] <%Dementedpenguin> This guy had so many chances. NotLikeThis
[1:14:56] <%QuadraticGravity> Hey Pat you got NOED?
[1:14:59] <$Dakuu75> Pat doesnt camp the exit like a bitch, he goes on the hunt
[1:15:00] <+Scevda> hat dude is weakest link

[1:15:16] <Captain_Doomsday> Too spicy Pat
[1:15:21] <%heartlesshealer> She really wanted to get them all out
[1:15:23] <%PlagueOfGripes> the whole peeking thing seems kind of useless
[1:15:27] <%patriotrenegade> Are ya winning son
[1:15:28] <%heartlesshealer> then she got stabbed
[1:15:28] <Captain_Doomsday> He needs Blood Warden.
[1:15:31] <+The_Butterfly_Man> dam if ya waited half a second you could have got her
[1:15:32] <%DensityD> ENTITY DISPLEASED
[1:15:35] <Rabicwill> cool costume for Ghostface though
[1:15:37] <%patriotrenegade> Damn
[1:15:38] <ABigPinkLion> It's cute
[1:15:41] <%QuadraticGravity> No One Escapes Death would have been 10/10 there
[1:15:46] <SummonerMagno> is chat the entity?
[1:15:46] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PlagueOfGripes Leaning builds up the stalk meter faster.
[1:15:50] <%MajorCrasher> peeking us much better with add-ons
[1:15:51] <RemnanTaka> Fredsworth
[1:15:54] <+Scevda> instead of 1 knife, I have 3 knives in one hand!
[1:15:54] <%heartlesshealer> are we spendin'?
[1:15:55] <smallheals> bit late to the party but how does taht killer actuly work ?
[1:15:55] <%Starotter70> sipsipHellmo
[1:15:56] <LustrousEudemon> you got some good hits in as usual
[1:15:57] <%MajorCrasher> is*
[1:16:02] <$Quiet__Viking> peeking makes stalking faster
[1:16:03] <deaddogsinrivers> They should put sexy anime woman Freddy
[1:16:07] <+Skelegroove> Freddy's face doesn't look very intimidating
[1:16:11] <pancakes789> just over use the word 'bitch' as freddy and youre good
[1:16:12] <Rabicwill> Oh shit the Prime Time man is here
[1:16:12] <jestrfestr> freddy the OG hollow
[1:16:13] <KeiPrime> freddy seen better days
[1:16:16] <Captain_Doomsday> NOED is tournment-banned. Survivor mains ree at it implicitly.
[1:16:16] <DaKnightWarrior> I know it won't happen but i really want a Horror Movie Fighting game
[1:16:19] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat what other kinds of killers you think the game needs
[1:16:24] <wilwright00> !uptime
[1:16:24] <%heartlesshealer> seems bad to play as
[1:16:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 16m.
[1:16:24] <ThorW> Freddy puts you to sleep if he hits you as well
[1:16:25] <Daskolin> Freddy have great mobility and can snare any loop
[1:16:29] <%Scooterbug9000> he can tp too gens also
[1:16:30] <+The_Butterfly_Man> doesn't peeking build it faster only if you have the add on
[1:16:32] <%ChestMimik> DIO would be a cool killer
[1:16:32] <FlongBongle> Freddy looks weird lmao
[1:16:35] <+bugz_munny> Remember when freddy turned his fingers into syryinges?
[1:16:36] <Captain_Doomsday> Freddy is top-tier, but hard to use.
[1:16:37] <deaddogsinrivers> They played some shitty horror movie fighting game on Fisticuffs once
[1:16:37] <%de1ete_forever> lousy smarch weather
[1:16:40] <Daskolin> Freddy is anti loop killer like nurse but easy
[1:16:41] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> grab ghost pallet
[1:16:42] <%DedlokPM> Teleport to Generators, not Hooks
[1:16:49] <%GraceTBM> @DaKnightWarrior check the old scrublords playlist, there's a jank one
[1:16:55] <deaddogsinrivers> Freddy
[1:16:57] <+chester804> hooks? you mena gens my good man
[1:16:58] <+The_Butterfly_Man> freddy is not top tir he like mid
[1:17:00] <ThorW> Freddy's like top 5 killer and very easy to use
[1:17:01] <smallheals> i mean the last killer uuuh from the scary movie
[1:17:02] <DaKnightWarrior> @deaddogsinrivers i remember that
[1:17:07] <EMP_SaltyMan> one of Freddy's abilities should just be him calling everyone a bitch
[1:17:10] <ha2ken> Terrordrome it was called I think...actually looked decent
[1:17:10] <Brainworm205> !uptime
[1:17:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 17m.
[1:17:12] <KeiPrime> oh fucking uh terrordrome?
[1:17:12] <%SvenHolgersson> GRATS DUDE
[1:17:15] <+mugwugsampoo> What's wrong with his face?
[1:17:16] <%patriotrenegade> yo Pat Have you seen ‚ÄúThe Ritual‚Äù dope-ass monster design
[1:17:17] <KeiPrime> that shit is nuts
[1:17:20] <+bugz_munny> Nah you could do like Chuckie
[1:17:27] <Captain_Doomsday> Man, I wish Netherrealm would make Terrordrome 2
[1:17:33] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:17:33] <%Tyndarian> As long as they don‚Äôt give freddy a dark meat callout
[1:17:37] <%DensityD> Blender
[1:17:37] <+bugz_munny> Leprechaun lol
[1:17:38] <ThorW> Nah, Freddy's a normal sized dude
[1:17:42] <Captain_Doomsday> Fun fact: Freddy will elongate if he steps in a bear trap.
[1:17:42] <+chester804> I play alot of Freddie, probably my best killer but I've heard he's kinda OP now
[1:17:42] <EuropanLamprey> They're all One Piece charcters
[1:17:47] <%Scooterbug9000> true
[1:17:48] <%Starotter70> Yeah?
[1:17:49] <+Phalcore1141> tall people are murderers
[1:17:50] <Malisin_Murder> Kappa
[1:17:52] <%spiritofmojave> besides you ofc
[1:17:52] <%Valdorick> Pat = Never Murder
[1:17:52] <%Typhaeon> Edward Kemper in particular
[1:17:52] <%UvBenServed> Seems legit
[1:17:53] <+Loinclothiclese> Thats not true at all
[1:17:53] <SomeOtherNeb> they'd do a small murder
[1:17:53] <Rabicwill> @ChestMimik just imagine hearing ZA WAAAAARUDO scream behind you in this game
[1:17:59] <+Scevda> The Leprechaun seems to disagree.
[1:17:59] <%spiritofmojave> Pat is small murder
[1:17:59] <%NovaKnightmare> Idk, one of the biggest murderers of all time was 5'4
[1:18:00] <%MakotoPB> Press X
[1:18:00] <londorpaleale> short people can have a little murder
[1:18:00] <sexdrugsvideogames> terrordrome 2 is in development
[1:18:02] <%BunnyEmperor> no, but short people would do a little murder
[1:18:02] <%Typhaeon> Great portrayal of him in Mind hunter
[1:18:02] <Dr_Suddenboner> very convincing pat
[1:18:02] <%chambatron> THAT'S WHAT SOMEONE WHOS SHORT WOULD SAY
[1:18:03] <bigbradish> Ted Bundy wasnt all that large
[1:18:04] <+Skelegroove> That your defense in court?
[1:18:04] <comedeity> lots of short people are murderous leaders
[1:18:04] <%patriotrenegade> Yes they woild
[1:18:04] <venomfury86> Chucky
[1:18:06] <londorpaleale> as a treat
[1:18:07] <+duckpuncher49> plus all the survivors have terrible hunched posture in comparison lol
[1:18:08] <DaKnightWarrior> hmmmmm
[1:18:09] <%fromnibelheim> it all checks out
[1:18:09] <deaddogsinrivers> Everyone in One Piece except for Straw Hats is like 10 foot tall
[1:18:11] <Malisin_Murder> Pat murders the puss
[1:18:12] <%TheFramedWarlock> Short people can have a little murder, as a treat
[1:18:13] <%AnIcedCoffee> @The_Butterfly_Man Leaning builds it up faster, the addon just makes it even better. And Freddy is absolutely top tier right now, especially in comparison to how easy he is to play.
[1:18:15] <$Dakuu75> Ah, you kids with your fancy college degrees. Shout outs to the college drop outs.
[1:18:18] <%Jhylla81> except Chuckie. But thats situational
[1:18:18] <%patriotrenegade> I bet the Green River Killer was a manlet
[1:18:20] <%NeoCre> Pat, Freddy is SUPER short
[1:18:26] <+Loinclothiclese> @PatStaresAt manson was 5'2 you big liar
[1:18:31] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt As a tip, you can charge your teleport to 99% and not complete it to force survivors off a gen if you're in a chase because the gen erupts in blood as you charge it
[1:18:33] <dinnydanny777> But a lower centre of gravity would probably be better for the stabbing
[1:18:34] <EMP_SaltyMan> this looks like reboot freddy
[1:18:37] <%houhilburn> Manson didn't kill anyone
[1:18:40] <%MajorCrasher> Chucky when?
[1:18:44] <%spiritofmojave> Just like Kiryu
[1:18:46] <%Starotter70> Freddy did nothing wrong
[1:18:47] <+lethallylactic> Kappa
[1:18:47] <%patriotrenegade> Remember when the actor who played Freddy was in Call of Duty Black Ops
[1:18:48] <+Loinclothiclese> @houhilburn cmonBruh
[1:18:48] <+bugz_munny> uuuuuuh
[1:18:50] <KaiserMario> Killed Johnny Depp tho
[1:18:50] <%Frost_Quill> I've got two associate degrees and I wanna go back to get a bachelor sometime, maybe even a masters eventually.
[1:18:51] <ha2ken> It was ALL a dream
[1:18:51] <SomeOtherNeb> OFFICER, ARREST THAT DREAM!
[1:18:52] <%WhereIsWill> if pat was ported into the game what would his weapon be???
[1:18:52] <+bugz_munny> need a fact check on that
[1:18:53] <venomfury86> Brightburn would be too OP for this game
[1:18:53] <$QuesoFM> except for all those kids
[1:18:54] <%sniffy77> saw never killed anyone
[1:18:55] <Malisin_Murder> Wasn't he a pedo though?
[1:18:57] <Jodoxk1> what about the kids he killed....
[1:18:58] <jj61794> Hold up a minute
[1:19:00] <KeiPrime> yeah he did, thats why they torched him
[1:19:01] <%thelonechris> He did kill kids before burning to death
[1:19:03] <Dr_Suddenboner> doesn't look like robert englund atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:19:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> He just did the bad touch, in the reboot
[1:19:05] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @AnIcedCoffee he is easy to play but not top tir rank 1s trash him
[1:19:06] <jj61794> Since when is Freddy Kreuger in Dead by Daylight?
[1:19:07] <+Jakeofalco> why does he get to come back
[1:19:09] <QaizerArt> @PatStaresAt Charles Manson was only 5'2"
[1:19:11] <HiddenDoubT> Freddy just wanted to make people's dreams come true
[1:19:13] <%Tyndarian> Freddy mad racist tho
[1:19:13] <Captain_Doomsday> Freddy was a pedo in the reboot, but they chickened out in the original.
[1:19:15] <KeiPrime> pat is a secondary elm street fan
[1:19:17] <+klassikFrank> In the remake, it's pretty explicit he's a pedo
[1:19:18] <pancakes789> peedoh
[1:19:18] <Captain_Doomsday> THIS is reboot Freddy.
[1:19:21] <%Jhylla81> Freddie killed all those kids before he became a human smore
[1:19:21] <%NovaKnightmare> Remake Freddy was a pedo
[1:19:22] <prime_name> It depends on which movie.
[1:19:23] <+klassikFrank> And DBD Freddy is the reboot Freddy
[1:19:23] <FlongBongle> Manson never killed anyone :)
[1:19:24] <SomeOtherNeb> good move
[1:19:24] <+chimaera24> He was only a pedo in the reboot
[1:19:27] <+jacintafor> i think they just made him a kid killer insteadof a pedo
[1:19:27] <%de1ete_forever> pedo is too close to home for Hollywood
[1:19:28] <%patriotrenegade> @qaizerart Manson never actually killed people himself did he
[1:19:30] <+taltalheights> If they added Chuckie how would you like/expect him to play like?
[1:19:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is reboot Freddy, so def pedo
[1:19:36] <%houhilburn> Also pat saying that makes me believe he totally killed someone
[1:19:37] <%Frost_Quill> I've never seen this series, I thought he was falsely accused of being that and got torched by his neighbors???
[1:19:38] <%MajorCrasher> reboot Freddy diddles kids
[1:19:38] <%DedlokPM> They reaffirmed the pedo aspect in the reboot tho
[1:19:40] <%a_goth_pancake> remake made him a pedo
[1:19:41] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:19:41] <Malisin_Murder> LUL
[1:19:42] <ThorW> It was pretty obvious with the way he talked about them being "my children"
[1:19:42] <bluefooddye1> Child murder, slightly better than child sexual abuse
[1:19:42] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[1:19:44] <%Starotter70> LUL
[1:19:44] <Captain_Doomsday> They've said they won't add Chuckie.
[1:19:44] <+bugz_munny> Takes 3 slashes to down but its hard af to see him
[1:19:44] <%SvenHolgersson> DELICIOUS
[1:19:44] <Dr_Suddenboner> nice hat idiot
[1:19:46] <comedeity> LUL
[1:19:46] <%NeoCre> Reboot Freddie BIG pedo
[1:19:47] <%weissguard> Roasted
[1:19:48] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[1:19:50] <+klassikFrank> I think you can see Freddy's kid dungeon in his map
[1:19:51] <Solidnick18> what
[1:19:51] <studleydoorite> get roasted, freddie
[1:19:53] <+bugz_munny> Chuckie would be the Teemo of DbD
[1:19:53] <%Mittastic> Freddy aint got no drip
[1:19:54] <londorpaleale> @weissguard heh
[1:19:55] <ha2ken> That gender swap Freddy though...
[1:19:55] <curse85> nah freddy was a child murderer thats why they torched him
[1:19:56] <Captain_Doomsday> We all know it's because Chucky would take a new animation set and BHVR is super lazy.
[1:19:57] <+jacintafor> did he lie though
[1:19:59] <FlongBongle> LUL
[1:20:00] <Glaicus> Freddy taking Michael Jordons quote of Fuck them kids a little to literally
[1:20:00] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt As a tip, you can charge your teleport to 99% and not complete it to force survivors off a gen if you're in a chase because the gen erupts in blood as you charge it. And you walk full speed while charging it
[1:20:01] <$Dakuu75> I always get hungry watching pat play this because he doesnt stop talking about BBQ and Chili
[1:20:02] <dinnydanny777> The guy who made Jeepers Creepers was in fact one though
[1:20:04] <%huskarl_zap> pat the pedo ghost that's right
[1:20:06] <KeiPrime> freddy's more like a grilled cheese than a smore
[1:20:06] <%AnIcedCoffee> @The_Butterfly_Man I'm rank 1 and use him to farm BP, he doesn't get trashed at all
[1:20:06] <%weissguard> @londorpaleale hue hue hue
[1:20:07] <%patriotrenegade> I feel like Chuckie is a super stupid enemy because you could just punt him into orbit
[1:20:16] <zangetsu_114> Wolverine roasted Freddy in the ERB tho
[1:20:20] <Captain_Doomsday> Freddy is now BEEF JERKEY
[1:20:26] <QaizerArt> @patriotrenegade he got charged with nine counts of murder, so he did
[1:20:29] <%a_goth_pancake> as if "child murderer" wasn't evil enough
[1:20:30] <%patriotrenegade> @plagueofgripes have you seen ‚ÄúThe Ritual‚Äù
[1:20:31] <SomeOtherNeb> there's too much shit to know about this game
[1:20:35] <+Elemntion> Couldnt they just add chucky before he transferred his soul into the doll?
[1:20:37] <%de1ete_forever> Mmm, freddy jerky
[1:20:41] <SomeOtherNeb> I love watching it but boy I would never play it
[1:20:42] <%patriotrenegade> Oh boy hamburger is almost here

[1:20:58] <%Typhaeon> The fake pallet shit is my favorite
[1:21:00] <+Scevda> The loading screen for players is amusing: Killker in the foreground "Awww I wanna be part of group" Survivors: "Haha were children!"
[1:21:01] <ha2ken> Freddy vision looks amazing
[1:21:02] <Rabicwill> hoooly shit this view is a game changer
[1:21:04] <ThorW> Freddy also has a smaller terror radius letting you get closer before they hear you
[1:21:04] <%patriotrenegade> Freddy looks like Deadpool
[1:21:09] <%ChestMimik> Five Nights at Freddy's Friday
[1:21:13] <%patriotrenegade> Deadpool looks like Freddy
[1:21:14] <Captain_Doomsday> I still think they're cowards for not getting the House 2 license.
[1:21:15] <%Dementedpenguin> Uh......

[1:21:21] <Solidnick18> yooo
[1:21:24] <Jetsfantasy> Oh wow. RTX off
[1:21:27] <dinnydanny777> Is Chucky like plastic or is he like made out of something hard because some dolls are super strong
[1:21:28] <%patriotrenegade> Both of them look like burnt testicles
[1:21:28] <QaizerArt> Oh wait you are right @patriotrenegade his murders were by proxy
[1:21:29] <SomeOtherNeb> ah the good ol dream hook
[1:21:30] <%huskarl_zap> that classic Warnabrother character FREDDIEFAZBEAR.
[1:21:33] <%PlagueOfGripes> Freddy's powers still make no sense to me
[1:21:34] <KeiPrime> the little flourish on his melee hit is kinda fun
[1:21:35] <%heartlesshealer> well, Freddy's burned to death, so yeah he looks like deadpool
[1:21:38] <Zombrocom> So how does new fred work
[1:21:40] <DaKnightWarrior> Sleepy time
[1:21:41] <studleydoorite> when do you think they'll get Disney's Smart House as a killer

[1:21:43] <%Scooterbug9000> they are having a little sleepy poo
[1:21:53] <%Jhylla81> Chuckie was plastic in the original movies
[1:22:07] <weeamood> This is a cool map
[1:22:08] <%NeoCre> @zombrocom completely differently. Like a paragraph of differences
[1:22:09] <%sniffy77> freddys powers are shut up dreams

[1:22:11] <KeiPrime> can you make goopy quicksand stairs like the movie cause that would be cool
[1:22:27] <Zombrocom> He looks like a normal killer now

[1:25:58] <Captain_Doomsday> These guys are doing well for a DC game.
[1:25:59] <Srthunda> pat is covering up the hud in the left that tells ya

[1:26:51] <%a_goth_pancake> man I never get to play on this map...
[1:26:55] <Captain_Doomsday> New Killer: Karen
[1:26:55] <%Scooterbug9000> okay karen
[1:27:02] <+deepvoid42> is freddy's special ability to diddle kids?
[1:27:03] <$Dakuu75> Some of these screams just crack me up
[1:27:05] <%huskarl_zap> pyramid head is the nightmare world manager
[1:27:05] <+bugz_munny> id fund it
[1:27:07] <DaKnightWarrior> Take her place
[1:27:11] <ThorW> I'm amazed Pat hasn't been against anyone with decisive strike
[1:27:24] <%PlagueOfGripes> nice floral pattern
[1:27:26] <%Starotter70> Heyaaaaaaaaah
[1:27:26] <%Nickmobox> @deepvoid42 That's his passive ability
[1:27:27] <+bugz_munny> Karen's shrill screams can disorient her prey
[1:27:30] <%DensityD> pat hates survivor gameplay
[1:27:31] <sexdrugsvideogames> are these glitches on purpose?
[1:27:36] <FlongBongle> Gg
[1:27:38] <%logoth_> How do they survive getting hung on a metal hook
[1:27:46] <Floofiie> Pat does killer games Paige does survivor games
[1:27:50] <%huskarl_zap> her pants were made in the same factory as woolies sweatshirt
[1:27:55] <KeiPrime> with a healthy case of tetanus i guess
[1:27:57] <Captain_Doomsday> Entity. If anything in the game is stupid, Entity.
[1:27:59] <%huskarl_zap> the couch factory
[1:28:02] <$Dakuu75> Nice drapes
[1:28:03] <%PlagueOfGripes> I don't think you're completing the kick animation Pat
[1:28:10] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I don't understand what the channeling does
[1:28:19] <+The_Protagonist> gettin hype for that Guilty Gear reveal psaGib
[1:28:25] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:28:27] <%heartlesshealer> rescue failed
[1:28:27] <%NeoCre> @logoth_ they‚Äôre getting hung by their shoulder
[1:28:30] <Captain_Doomsday> When the cannel is full he teleports to a chosen gen
[1:28:41] <ThorW> @SaphronBlackbourne He either channelts to teleport to a generator or he puts a "dream pallet" down which is a fake pallet to trick survivors into thinking an area is safe when it's not
[1:28:41] <venomfury86> Smell of the game
[1:28:41] <FlongBongle> F
[1:28:47] <DaKnightWarrior> @the_protagonist when are they showing it?
[1:28:48] <Srthunda> that channeling is a teleport, but it is obvious so pat is faking it to make them run
[1:28:54] <+deepvoid42> is it just me or are these survivors exceptionally bad
[1:28:57] <Captain_Doomsday> Remember when Left Behind boosted gen speed?
[1:29:01] <+BoondockJoker> gonna have me some fun... gonna have me some fun
[1:29:03] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> UH OH
[1:29:03] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:29:06] <%NeoCre> Or puts down pools of BLUD
[1:29:09] <ha2ken> This is the End Game
[1:29:16] <%DedlokPM> @logoth_ 1) nothing vital gets punctured. 2) this is a world where whether you "die" or escape you return to a campire until your next turn in the Trials
[1:29:22] <%huskarl_zap> when I get dere, gonna stab!
[1:29:30] <%PlagueOfGripes> you were already at it and left
[1:29:39] <Shade075> Is the Silent Hill stuff out in this game yet?
[1:29:40] <ThorW> @SaphronBlackbourne Channeling the teleport makes a generator erupt in blood and survivors know you're coming, so starting it but not completing it lets you trick survivors into not working on it
[1:29:46] <+Estuko> Woah quitter bonus!
[1:29:47] <%DensityD> gg
[1:29:48] <KeiPrime> its purgatory where u keep getting killed by monsters

[1:30:20] <+Captain_Spicy_> Clown buff Pog
[1:30:21] <%Scooterbug9000> clown is annoying
[1:30:21] <ThorW> It's a very minor buff that does little
[1:30:22] <ABigPinkLion> What are the changes?
[1:30:23] <%sniffy77> i don't think thats a very good clown
[1:30:23] <MavrickHauntX1999> Jiggly Clown Belly
[1:30:23] <GrandmasterBFunk> oh no not sad clown
[1:30:24] <amiavamp> oh hey it's Vinny on a Sunday
[1:30:25] <%boomstickery> i dont feel happy

[1:30:29] <%Starotter70> I mean you have the hair for a clown, eyyy
[1:30:30] <Shade075> @rumtumtugnutz Thanks
[1:30:31] <+razielhex> KILLER KLOWNZ
[1:30:31] <j0ustar> I hate clowns so much
[1:30:33] <%GarbageNirvana> We all float down here
[1:30:38] <%huskarl_zap> the joker from the movie the joker? pogschamp
[1:30:38] <Captain_Doomsday> Clown needs everything he can get
[1:30:40] <dinnydanny777> Is this clown's music? It's terrible
[1:30:40] <+razielhex> from OUTERSPACE
[1:30:45] <ThorW> It's something at least, yeah.
[1:30:45] <%Scooterbug9000> you and clown have the same hair
[1:30:46] <+Estuko> clown girls tho
[1:30:46] <wyrdboy21121> I love playing clowman
[1:30:50] <%maenos2> reminder that japan does not have the fear of clowns and thus wants to fuck 'em
[1:30:55] <Captain_Doomsday> They also slow vault speed.
[1:30:56] <%PlagueOfGripes> not enough hot killers
[1:30:58] <ThorW> Clown's power is to VAPE VapeNation
[1:31:00] <%UvBenServed> Just like regular clowns
[1:31:00] <londorpaleale> He throws Faygo
[1:31:02] <GrandmasterBFunk> at the rate they are going, i could see Pennywise being added to the game
[1:31:04] <ha2ken> Clown aka Drugman
[1:31:04] <+deepvoid42> clown man got dat GUT
[1:31:08] <FlongBongle> you‚Äôll float too PartyTime
[1:31:08] <Srthunda> The clowns mori made me sick when I first saw it
[1:31:09] <%Mittastic> @maenos2 clearly you havent seen a hot clown
[1:31:11] <$Dakuu75> Uh-HA! Uh-HA! Uh-HA!
[1:31:11] <wyrdboy21121> when he vaults he's only one who makes a grunt
[1:31:13] <ShichiNoBushi> They made you a character in DBD, Pat?
[1:31:14] <DaKnightWarrior> Clowns hot tdsPARDON
[1:31:15] <ghostpalacio> @maenos2 nice
[1:31:17] <SomeOtherNeb> clown orb
[1:31:21] <%Tyndarian> Sooo, the clown gases the protesters
[1:31:22] <%kyh9> Xenomorph?
[1:31:27] <MyNameIsRasus> What about bugsnax tho
[1:31:29] <%UvBenServed> Graboids when?
[1:31:31] <%huskarl_zap> @londorpaleale lol nove
[1:31:33] <SainEdge> Candyman would be dope
[1:31:34] <+bugz_munny> Nemisis?
[1:31:39] <TheRealEerie> Candyman would be cool
[1:31:45] <+deepvoid42> when's Leprechaun?
[1:31:50] <%Piemono> If there's a Candyman killer it won't be until the new movie comes out
[1:31:51] <ABigPinkLion> Silent Hill is like a step down from Friday the 13th being added to the game so frankly nothing will surprise me anymore
[1:31:52] <+ROBOSAPION6499> what video game killers do you think could make it sense pyramid head is in the game now
[1:31:54] <ShichiNoBushi> Predator has Hunting Grounds, now.
[1:31:55] <Daxalog> What would Xeno do? Set traps?
[1:31:56] <wyrdboy21121> bubba is top tier
[1:31:56] <%Starotter70> I want Leprechaun so BAD
[1:31:56] <%NeoCre> Jigggle the clorb
[1:31:56] <+Estuko> @Nomad_Scholar That'd be awesome!!
[1:31:58] <Captain_Doomsday> Cannibal can multidown. I still think Wraith's the WORST.
[1:31:58] <%de1ete_forever> Patrick Bateman?
[1:31:58] <$Dakuu75> Clown has big-orb
[1:32:00] <%Scooterbug9000> hes round like you payt
[1:32:02] <MavrickHauntX1999> The Thing would be interesting having like a fake survivor spawn randomly in the match
[1:32:02] <%deadredeyez> fuck this guys gas as a survivor
[1:32:02] <ThorW> No, Bubba at least has instant down if he gets on you. Clown is just sad
[1:32:04] <Veteranhelldiver17> now that we have pyramid head, why not scissorman from clocktower or Nemesis/Mr X?
[1:32:05] <DaKnightWarrior> Chucky...but he's so small
[1:32:07] <KeiPrime> Lola Pop Kreygasm
[1:32:08] <%patriotrenegade> Xenomorpj would be too op
[1:32:09] <+bugz_munny> Adachi lol
[1:32:10] <+KingOfTheFist> Has anyone made the incredibly original joke yet that the clown is Pat?
[1:32:14] <%huskarl_zap> ah yes pennywise spider alien satan from the gunslinger universe
[1:32:15] <tuxedosaiyan> Chucky
[1:32:17] <ABigPinkLion> Yep
[1:32:18] <BigNerdSam> Why does Pat have his face cam on the main screen?
[1:32:19] <Captain_Doomsday> Amen to that.
[1:32:22] <%kyh9> Which Sci-fi killers would you want?
[1:32:24] <ha2ken> So become Reptile
[1:32:27] <venomfury86> Jeepers Creepers
[1:32:27] <$Chatterbox1991> we need to get Manic Cop in dead by daylight
[1:32:28] <ABigPinkLion> He shows his footsteps anyway that's enough
[1:32:31] <%kyh9> Terminator?
[1:32:32] <MavrickHauntX1999> I prefer Nurse over Wraith
[1:32:32] <wyrdboy21121> just stand still to be invisible Kappa
[1:32:35] <%Scooterbug9000> hows paiges butt?
[1:32:36] <ThorW> Wraith is very VERY add-on and perk dependant. You need the BEST STUFF for Wraith to not suck
[1:32:36] <TomFrank> wraith is pretty bad yea
[1:32:37] <Captain_Doomsday> Maniac Cop's a good pull!
[1:32:38] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat how about a Grabboid from Tremors
[1:32:38] <$ItsRatman> Tyrant for DBD?
[1:32:39] <$Chatterbox1991> Robert Z'dar killer
[1:32:40] <%Starotter70> Look at that mighty Orb
[1:32:41] <%PlagueOfGripes> I already can't make sense of Wraith. last thing I need is for it to just be invisible
[1:32:46] <FlongBongle> Maniac Cop would be dope
[1:32:47] <%DedlokPM> Clown is far worse than bubba because at least bubba has an actual ability. Clown just slightly messes up their vission and makes them slightly slower. @PatStaresAt
[1:32:47] <%kyh9> @ItsRatman That's fucking strong
[1:32:50] <dinnydanny777> Jeepers Creepers might be kind of an issue considering the creator is a massive scumbag
[1:32:55] <+deepvoid42> Leprechaun for DBD
[1:32:57] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Wraith is great with addons and total thrash without them. Addons are literally his life support
[1:32:57] <Captain_Doomsday> Clown is Huntress but worse.
[1:33:01] <dapperskeleton69> tf2 spy for killer
[1:33:02] <$ZerephTheFirst> @PlagueOfGripes Loved your most recent Necron vid
[1:33:06] <TomFrank> i just like ringing the lil bell
[1:33:07] <%PlagueOfGripes> but he always bongs
[1:33:09] <%huskarl_zap> the car from the Carrie gunslinger universe phase 2
[1:33:11] <%MajorCrasher> I still think the nurse is the worst since her nerf
[1:33:13] <ravenconspiracy> Wraith is pretty decent but he needs add ins to be good. Default wraith will just get stomped
[1:33:13] <%kyh9> What's an archetype do you think isn't covered rn? An alien would be interesting
[1:33:15] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt unless they're using the addon that muffles da bong
[1:33:15] <jestrfestr> bing bong
[1:33:26] <ABigPinkLion> Pay attention to every first and third bong
[1:33:26] <ha2ken> Wraith always high..ok got it
[1:33:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Invis chars still disturb grass, so there is that.
[1:33:29] <%sniffy77> If the thing was a monster in this, they should make their typical form being some cronenberg monster, but after one survivor dies or is sacrificed they can take the form of them.
[1:33:30] <dapperskeleton69> ding dong ditch wraith
[1:33:31] <%DatGuyJimbo> alien would just plant facehuggers round the map
[1:33:31] <ThorW> I'd be interested in seeing a Zombie archetype
[1:33:35] <%de1ete_forever> u could always just hit da bong
[1:33:38] <Veteranhelldiver17> Why not a goddamned werewolf at this point?
[1:33:38] <%huskarl_zap> Haunted trucks from that ctv movie
[1:33:48] <jestrfestr> grind more
[1:33:48] <dinnydanny777> When you catch them do you spray them with a flower
[1:33:50] <%PlagueOfGripes> I want The Thing but its power set would make almost no sense, in addition to it being a nightmare to model
[1:34:00] <%Mittastic> is there a cop archetype? or is clown the closest we're getting
[1:34:02] <%Scooterbug9000> werewolf in london
[1:34:02] <dinnydanny777> Just add Dracula
[1:34:06] <+bugz_munny> Any vampires?
[1:34:08] <+chester804> a windigo
[1:34:11] <%Starotter70> We need more furries in this game
[1:34:11] <dinnydanny777> Just, "Dracula"
[1:34:13] <+Estuko> Big sexy werewolf, fucking awesome idea
[1:34:14] <%SvenHolgersson> WHERE IS ZAAT
[1:34:15] <catwithsunglasses> wraith is incredibly easy to face, just keep an eye on all possible entrances to the gens you're working on and then listen for bing bong
[1:34:15] <vilelee> werewolf would be neat
[1:34:15] <Captain_Doomsday> We have Hag. She's almost a Wendigo
[1:34:16] <wyrdboy21121> Voodoo killer?
[1:34:17] <%huskarl_zap> why not Gangreil from the WWE Vampite the masquerade bloodlines universe
[1:34:17] <%SvenHolgersson> I WANT ZAAT
[1:34:18] <TomFrank> Rawhead Rex
[1:34:19] <%patriotrenegade> @patstaresat are there skins you can get for the killers or similar stuff
[1:34:19] <+Buzzkill983> Black Lagoon Creature?
[1:34:20] <Nomad_Scholar> Cenobites!
[1:34:21] <KeiPrime> add a mummy
[1:34:22] <vilelee> oh, a swamp thing
[1:34:22] <Veteranhelldiver17> Drac is public
[1:34:23] <@SoFarFetched> I would assume
[1:34:23] <%NovaKnightmare> yes
[1:34:23] <ThorW> yes
[1:34:24] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt Werewolf can be the first killer with a vertical jump
[1:34:24] <+worldbrand> imagine father gascoigne
[1:34:25] <%king_wragles> At this point, yes
[1:34:25] <+PleasantLee> of course he is idot
[1:34:25] <JoeBecomesJoe> Very yes
[1:34:26] <%Valdorick> Werewolf - he acts like a Survivor, but sabotages instead of helps with gens
[1:34:26] <pancakes789> toxic avenger
[1:34:27] <%Nekros4442> Yes actually
[1:34:27] <dinnydanny777> It's two hundred years old so yeah
[1:34:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Dracula MUST be public domain by now
[1:34:28] <MavrickHauntX1999> Or Tall Man from Phantasm
[1:34:29] <+bugz_munny> vampires are
[1:34:29] <EMP_SaltyMan> we need every default Halloween costume as a killer
[1:34:31] <%spiritofmojave> by now, yes
[1:34:33] <%DatGuyJimbo> add cujo
[1:34:33] <+chester804> The Creeper from Jeepers Creepers is one I really want
[1:34:33] <ItIsSky> I think Nosferatu is
[1:34:34] <MyNameIsRasus> honk
[1:34:35] <$Dakuu75> Hell yeah, appease the furries
[1:34:35] <+taltalheights> Pinhead?
[1:34:35] <ha2ken> Put in a bear because Woolie ain't scared of no spook
[1:34:35] <%UvBenServed> Heh
[1:34:36] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:34:36] <%PlagueOfGripes> vampires have been public domain for thousands of years
[1:34:37] <%NovaKnightmare> why not just Alucard
[1:34:37] <+bugz_munny> lolscrubs
[1:34:37] <Dr_Suddenboner> blacula is public domain
[1:34:37] <Veteranhelldiver17> or alucard
[1:34:37] <%arcanemacrocosm> should be
[1:34:38] <vilelee> frankenstein! do a frankenstein!
[1:34:38] <%king_wragles> Apparently he entered public domain like, 30 ish years ago?
[1:34:39] <%NeoCre> Also would overlap with the Demogorgon

[1:34:59] <KeiPrime> at this point dr. acula is a public domain joke
[1:35:00] <catwithsunglasses> The Acula?
[1:35:01] <BigNerdSam> Pat, Dr. Acula is a joke from Scrubs.
[1:35:01] <+KingOfTheFist> When are they gonna add a Mortal Kombat guest
[1:35:03] <+gogorobotz> Dr. Acula is from Scrubs
[1:35:04] <%Dementedpenguin> The DbD devs just need to get the Darkstalkers license. Capcom isn't using them Kappa
[1:35:07] <SomeOtherNeb> Dr. Acula, original character DO NOT STEAL
[1:35:09] <srkAres> my stream just fucking died, literally as pat finished saying acula

[1:35:30] <vilelee> he don't bite, he scrape, and liiiiiick
[1:35:34] <londorpaleale> They should do s cereal tie in with Count Chocula
[1:35:34] <+The_Protagonist> let's be real, Dr. Acula is absolutely a joke people could have come up with before Scrubs. I love Scrubs to death but it's not that mindblowing of a joke lol
[1:35:35] <Reizie_Etherealm> HYEH HYEH HYEH
[1:35:36] <Nomad_Scholar> If the creator wasn't in hot shit, The Creeper
[1:35:38] <%DensityD> HEH EHHE HEH
[1:35:38] <Zebroneath> All crows get replaced with bats and you can teleport to spooked bats.
[1:35:39] <Captain_Doomsday> The Count is a High Daywalker.
[1:35:40] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:35:40] <+SolidusRex> Blackenstein
[1:35:42] <KeiPrime> the clown come swith a pack of marlboro reds in his sleeve or what, jeez that voice
[1:35:44] <%Capta1n_H3nry> What about a Scooby-Doo inspired killer/survivor?
[1:35:47] <$Dakuu75> I‚Äôd like a final fantasy Mind Flayer or Tonnberry. THOSE are scary
[1:35:48] <Dr_Suddenboner> love how pat ignores getting called out for blatant plagiarism of scrubs atpCap
[1:35:49] <studleydoorite> why does no one else want Disney's Smart House for killer?
[1:35:51] <%luftraumm1> I genuinely think death scissors are one odd the best dmc enemy designs
[1:35:52] <%Starotter70> That sounds like me after running for 5 secs
[1:35:54] <%argavus> Scrappy doo?
[1:35:57] <+taltalheights> Bloof Feast Island Man from ATHF
[1:35:58] <wyrdboy21121> It's fun tossing bottles at trees or ceilings, cowers a big area
[1:35:58] <Jetsfantasy> @The_Protagonist No doubt about that
[1:36:01] <pancakes789> shaken, not turd
[1:36:02] <venomfury86> Plague Doctor from SCP
[1:36:04] <+YabbaTroll> he doesnt sound very healthy
[1:36:09] <%king_wragles> Huh, I figured the whole roofie clown thing was a joke.
[1:36:12] <+deepvoid42> we need the shark from deep blue
[1:36:14] <SomeOtherNeb> fart gas bottles!
[1:36:14] <dinnydanny777> Why does no one want Corey In the House for Dead by Daylight :(
[1:36:16] <%huskarl_zap> blue falcon from the boomerang time Warner universe
[1:36:16] <%king_wragles> That's his main mechanic apparently
[1:36:19] <%Valdorick> What... were you doing, bro?
[1:36:24] <sexdrugsvideogames> Scissorman from Clock Tower
[1:36:25] <+The_Butterfly_Man> just had a match where a guy said it was boring that I insta downed them every time with Micheal like what do they expect for me to not use my power
[1:36:26] <%JumboCrunchies> Did the Clown get his buff yet? Or is that next week, too.
[1:36:27] <Captain_Doomsday> 15% slow
[1:36:28] <SomeOtherNeb> @dinnydanny777 too powerful
[1:36:30] <+cheezy_snackz> im surprised this isnt already a killer that uses giant scissors
[1:36:31] <wyrdboy21121> 15% slow
[1:36:34] <ravenconspiracy> Clown is probably the worst killer in the game.
[1:36:34] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles yeah it's in his backstory on why he does that.
[1:36:35] <Captain_Doomsday> Next week for buff
[1:36:36] <MyNameIsRasus> SCP 106 would be sick
[1:36:37] <+cheezy_snackz> *there
[1:36:37] <ThorW> Now time to spend 20 years reloading bottles PogChamp
[1:36:43] <catwithsunglasses> you're not running the dumb clown elephant head, Pat?
[1:36:46] <catwithsunglasses> shame
[1:36:50] <vilelee> scp 682, you already can't kill the killers
[1:36:50] <%Jekado> why is a clown throwing potions?
[1:36:53] <%argavus> slenderman mabey?
[1:36:54] <%DensityD> pop goes the weasel
[1:36:56] <londorpaleale> @Dr_Suddenboner the joke had been made way before then, I think even the metalcore band of the same name pre-dates scrubs
[1:36:56] <%Valdorick> Oh hey, hook right there.
[1:36:58] <$Afterman_> he is throwing pee bottles
[1:36:58] <%Jekado> he isn't really clown like
[1:37:01] <Captain_Doomsday> That's what clowns do, right? Drug people?
[1:37:04] <dinnydanny777> Clown should be able to throw his knife
[1:37:04] <%patriotrenegade> 682 is too big
[1:37:12] <%patriotrenegade> Maybe 096?
[1:37:12] <DaKnightWarrior> He's a fat guy throwing bottles. I like him.
[1:37:14] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ghost face ?
[1:37:23] <ThorW> ohh she kept the pallet up
[1:37:24] <studleydoorite> Pat have you ever thought about becoming a clown @PatStaresAt
[1:37:25] <SomeOtherNeb> he seems decent to me, why don't people like him?
[1:37:27] <Captain_Doomsday> He did Ghostface
[1:37:28] <Veteranhelldiver17> What a about those guys from hellraiser or whatever it was called?
[1:37:30] <%huskarl_zap> WHY NOT BIRDS FROM. BIRDS!
[1:37:31] <%king_wragles> @Pookiedaexzile clown
[1:37:32] <Nomad_Scholar> He is one
[1:37:34] <catwithsunglasses> you should, it's big and dumb
[1:37:37] <@SoFarFetched> Maybe its cause people don't like clowns in general
[1:37:40] <+bugz_munny> Any TV Series killers that would be good?
[1:37:40] <@SoFarFetched> so its like "ew clown"
[1:37:41] <Reizie_Etherealm> Potion seller! I no longer have any need for your strongest potions! Stop!
[1:37:41] <+StooEsq> someone get Clown a lozenge
[1:37:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> No no its ICP
[1:37:47] <vilelee> the birds from birdemic
[1:37:48] <+The_Butterfly_Man> does anyone have copy rights on SCPs or are they all public domain
[1:37:50] <$Dakuu75> This killer sounds like hes gonna fucking keel over any second lol
[1:37:52] <Dr_Suddenboner> @londorpaleale and here come the apologists #justiceforscrubs
[1:37:55] <sexdrugsvideogames> Pinhead
[1:37:57] <dinnydanny777> When do they add Godzilla
[1:37:59] <%argavus> The clowns backstory is fucked up tough
[1:37:59] <venomfury86> The Killer Tomatoes
[1:38:01] <Captain_Doomsday> Ooooh, the direct hit.
[1:38:03] <vilelee> oh @The_Butterfly_Man you don't wanna open that box of worms
[1:38:05] <%patriotrenegade> SCPs probably belong to their respective authors.
[1:38:07] <%Valdorick> He's a denial hero
[1:38:07] <wyrdboy21121> @SomeOtherNeb lot of small dumb things about him, like ppl screaming when chased, grunting when he vaults, having to reload every time
[1:38:08] <%juxtest> Direct hit
[1:38:08] <$Afterman_> pyramid head is basically pinhead
[1:38:09] <MavrickHauntX1999> hya ha ha ha
[1:38:13] <Captain_Doomsday> There's a pink addon that makes direct hits prime instadowns
[1:38:15] <SomeOtherNeb> @vilelee the main actor from Birdemic is far more terrifying
[1:38:15] <$Chatterbox1991> Come to think of it Maniac Cop seems SUPER APPLICABLE AND RELEVENT right about now to be a killer in DBDL
[1:38:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> When are they adding PumpkinHead
[1:38:19] <FlongBongle> These guys suck
[1:38:21] <%JumboCrunchies> He's not bad. He's just kind of an M1 killer with a power that slows you way down to reload. Less powerful than someone like Billy or Spirit
[1:38:22] <%patriotrenegade> Though I heard some jack ass was trying to claim ownership over every SCP
[1:38:24] <%Starotter70> I'm still waiting for a flock of birds to be added
[1:38:27] <ThorW> The view mess up really isn't that bad. Just the slow down hurts
[1:38:28] <londorpaleale> Is that a bottle of piss?
[1:38:30] <Captain_Doomsday> Unlike Huntress' pink that lets a direct hit instadown on its own
[1:38:31] <%huskarl_zap> Mr.H from the pinhead hell on earth universe
[1:38:31] <%logoth_> Add Samurai Cop
[1:38:35] <vilelee> yeah a guy in russia has claimed he owns it all
[1:38:37] <SomeOtherNeb> @wyrdboy21121 I see, thanks. Not really noticing the differences since I don't play the game
[1:38:41] <%argavus> if we cajt get jason can we get his mom instead?
[1:38:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> Add Big Fat Ethel
[1:38:42] <KeiPrime> add My Bloody Valentine Miner
[1:38:42] <MyNameIsRasus> @patriotrenegade SCP is all Creative Commons
[1:38:44] <%realm_forge> Hey Pat who is your and Paige‚Äôs favorite killer so far?
[1:38:48] <+xmetalicdemonx> how many bloodpoints is typically needed to max a characer?
[1:38:50] <therealtacopancakes> Who i9s he playing as?
[1:38:52] <%patriotrenegade> How bout a Shark with robot spider legs like from that Junji Ito story
[1:38:55] <SomeOtherNeb> clown
[1:38:56] <zenith0111> You pretty much play this game just based off sound
[1:38:56] <vilelee> and because russian copyright is complicated.... he maybe does a lil in russia?
[1:38:57] <dinnydanny777> When do they add a Dalek
[1:39:02] <ThorW> Huntress is hard to play, but is really really good in the right hands.
[1:39:03] <venomfury86> How about Maniac Cop?
[1:39:03] <%nmaten> huntress is definitely way stronger than clown tho
[1:39:10] <$Chatterbox1991> Also Ricky from Silent Night Deadly Night; GARBAGE DAY
[1:39:11] <%GraceTBM> Russia doesn't abide by Commons and such, they're trying to get the russian courts to establish precedence
[1:39:12] <$Afterman_> huntress is good if youre scott jund and can noscope 420 flick shot
[1:39:16] <%Pookiedaexzile> When They finna Add Mighty Joe young
[1:39:17] <studleydoorite> Clown likes you too :)
[1:39:17] <Copious_Koopies> 1.3 million bp
[1:39:19] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Huntress is great if you stick a piece of paper in center of monitor
[1:39:21] <Captain_Doomsday> A Dalek would be invincible. Except for stairs
[1:39:22] <$Dakuu75> @the_butterfly_man theyre suppose to be public domain because theyre ideas from tons of ppl but some ass hole was trying to copy write claim the whole thing
[1:39:30] <+duckpuncher49> i like his feather knife
[1:39:32] <%king_wragles> What would be Clown's biggest downside, currently?
[1:39:36] <Daxalog> is clown from a movie?
[1:39:38] <$Afterman_> hes fat5
[1:39:46] <Captain_Doomsday> Clown's reload speed is a nightmare.
[1:39:50] <TomFrank> add manbearpig, hes half man, half bear, and half pig
[1:39:52] <jestrfestr> deathslinger seems low effprt
[1:39:54] <catwithsunglasses> huntress needs somewhat decent aim, whereas clown allows for more leinency. that being said, huntress allows for greater avalanche potential when paired with the right perks and add-ons
[1:39:55] <zenith0111> Is Nurse still top tier?
[1:39:56] <dinnydanny777> When do they add Event Horizon, from the 90s movie, Event Horizon
[1:39:56] <$Afterman_> clown is not from a movie
[1:39:57] <ThorW> Huntress hatchets are actually shitty with their hitboxes which makes it so hard.
[1:39:58] <%patriotrenegade> no he‚Äôs just a clown
[1:40:00] <KeiPrime> he's FAT
[1:40:02] <$Afterman_> nurse will always be top tier
[1:40:05] <Captain_Doomsday> Nurse is lower than Spirit now.
[1:40:06] <%BunnyEmperor> LUL
[1:40:08] <+xmetalicdemonx> My favorite part about Huntress is when I just make a hail merry shot and actually hit someone.
[1:40:14] <%Valdorick> Pro move, Surv Brah
[1:40:14] <londorpaleale> Tomie, have her able to disguise as a survivor
[1:40:26] <%patriotrenegade> The devs should make a Bubblehead Nurse skin
[1:40:29] <%Starotter70> Heeee hah ahaha
[1:40:30] <%DensityD> HAA HACK HYEA HYA
[1:40:33] <+lethallylactic> @londorpaleale Tomie PogChamp
[1:40:35] <$ragingbrachy> clown shit
[1:40:37] <EMP_SaltyMan> not one decisive
[1:40:38] <Zebroneath> He sounds like Ganon from Wind Waker
[1:40:38] <Nomad_Scholar> He can laugh or run, he can't do both
[1:40:39] <wyrdboy21121> flask of bleach addon for clown is really good
[1:40:40] <%NeoCre> @catwithsunglasses huntress is much more skill intensive, but MUCH better if you get that skill and hit those shots
[1:40:41] <%Valdorick> He sounds like a smokes a jar of whiskey a day.
[1:40:41] <SomeOtherNeb> he sounds like a pervert that chainsmokes
[1:40:42] <MavrickHauntX1999> Smoker cough
[1:40:44] <$Afterman_> pat have you tried oni? I think youd like his slug playstyle
[1:40:48] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt Pat's playing as a homicidal fat clown.... How wildly appropriate....
[1:40:48] <%argavus> this dude is gonna have a heart attack before the end of the match
[1:40:55] <%WhereIsWill> clown been chainsmokin since he was 8
[1:40:56] <Veteranhelldiver17> would one of the monsters from amnesia the dark decent work in this game?
[1:40:59] <vilelee> my go to joke for these ideas was "haha what about a dude with a gun" but... they actually did that
[1:41:03] <catwithsunglasses> next killer might be candy-man since there's a new movie coming
[1:41:06] <vilelee> and it worked!
[1:41:06] <dinnydanny777> But when do they add Sephiroth
[1:41:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> When they finna add the weird chick from Misery
[1:41:11] <ThorW> taht pop value PogChamp He just undid like 20 seconds of work
[1:41:11] <%huskarl_zap> why not Goop from the goop cinematic universe
[1:41:14] <MavrickHauntX1999> Clown needs some ginger tea and cough drops
[1:41:16] <+lethallylactic> Candy Man could be fun
[1:41:16] <ABigPinkLion> Man they cannot catch a break with those skill checks
[1:41:17] <vilelee> candyman seems way likely
[1:41:17] <+Javaa01> A pack a day is just a part of the draw of the carney life
[1:41:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> and her alt skin from Audition
[1:41:20] <SainEdge> i just started playing dbd and have no idea how good or bad the killers are. But i really like huntress
[1:41:23] <%patriotrenegade> I want the Eraserhead baby
[1:41:25] <catwithsunglasses> can't wait for da bees
[1:41:26] <ha2ken> A direct hit with potion should insta-down
[1:41:26] <%LenDawsonsFresca> add Mrs. Voorhees
[1:41:27] <%juxtest> What if Clown canonically got sick and died so they didn't have to give him a rework
[1:41:37] <dinnydanny777> Add Ms Pacman
[1:41:43] <dan_g_v> goop from the alternative medicine of that blonde actress?
[1:41:45] <$Afterman_> if you wanna see a tier list of dbd killers, go to dennis reep's site
[1:41:45] <Captain_Doomsday> If you really want to study DbD, watch Otzdarva
[1:41:47] <%Valdorick> Baited
[1:41:49] <dinnydanny777> Ms Pacman's gimmick is that she eats the survivors
[1:41:49] <%BunnyEmperor> LUL
[1:41:50] <%argavus> whens samta from santa slays coming?
[1:41:52] <$ragingbrachy> Jebaited
[1:41:53] <%Valdorick> Counter baited
[1:41:54] <ThorW> @SainEdge Huntress is one of the better killers, as long as you have goood aim
[1:41:54] <$Afterman_> scott jund is also a good dbd streamer
[1:41:56] <ABigPinkLion> Jebaited
[1:41:56] <%Mittastic> DONT SMOKE KIDS

[1:42:12] <%huskarl_zap> no a horror movie just called goop. I think
[1:42:13] <dinnydanny777> Add Mothman
[1:42:13] <sexdrugsvideogames> Clown looks modeled after the movie 'the devil's rejects'
[1:42:18] <%Starotter70> Don't smoke, you'll turn into an evil Clown
[1:42:18] <%houhilburn> Pat are you gamer?
[1:42:18] <%LenDawsonsFresca> Krampus for a Christmas update?
[1:42:21] <%de1ete_forever> roll up some kids into a big fat blunt

[1:44:03] <+Commiekin> Bray Wyatt

[1:44:24] <SainEdge> no it was me :)
[1:44:24] <%Valdorick> I feel like the glass would do more than the gas.
[1:44:29] <Captain_Doomsday> They'd never add Karen because she'd need to have voicelines.
[1:44:31] <vilelee> uzumaki, just a bunch of evil spirals
[1:44:34] <jestrfestr> call me crazy but what about new objectives instead of another killer? LUL
[1:44:40] <$Afterman_> karen's power would be being racist\

[1:56:03] <Captain_Doomsday> Plague allegedly drops off because she has nothing that helps her hit players, and Red rankers never make mistakes to get hit.

[2:01:20] <dinnydanny777> Maybe they like your barf
[2:01:24] <Captain_Doomsday> Cleansing sabotages the entire team so you'll be yelled at for doing it.
[2:01:29] <Daxalog> BM?
[2:01:30] <ABigPinkLion> survivors can have little a barf as a treat
[2:01:31] <$Afterman_> it's best to not cleanse iirc

[2:02:21] <+Commiekin> @Aleate Corrupt Blood is basically a stream of a million hatchets raining down on your head. It's so much worse especially if you can loop properly
[2:02:21] <catwithsunglasses> just play the game with the one health state, it's literally easier than cleansing, which is the biggest problem with plag
[2:02:24] <Captain_Doomsday> Use it don't lose it

[2:02:40] <+Soulbishop> Is covid 19 in the barf? It does cause weakness and coughing?
[2:02:43] <dinnydanny777> There was someone left
[2:02:46] <%WhereIsWill> barfs on the inside
[2:02:48] <ThirstyShark> blind

[2:15:16] <%ElkRiverDog> sipsipHellmo
[2:15:18] <%MajorCrasher> btw his dash attack can destroy pallets
[2:15:20] <JD_1203> is PH out yet?
[2:15:21] <prime_name> Was that the smash invite?
[2:15:22] <dinnydanny777> They should add ExDeath
[2:15:22] <Captain_Doomsday> Aren't all lunges the same code?
[2:15:23] <+Soulbishop> Wait there is a lunge?
[2:15:27] <$ragingbrachy> DONT SEND IT TO HIM
[2:15:27] <+RiseRequiem> hey pat, for those of us who've never played the game, could you comment on what your objective / the survivors objective is (except for killing/surviving respectively)
[2:15:28] <%Valask> Valask subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Fuck dat tiddie
[2:15:29] <+Commiekin> All base lunges are the same, but his lunge power is absolutely better
[2:15:29] <%WhereIsWill> pat how do i get volta to do a commission for me tho?!?!
[2:15:31] <%Garthunox> pat are you playing TLOU2 to see the train wreck next week?
[2:15:31] <ThorW> Demo has Shred though
[2:15:34] <%heartlesshealer> they're probably making it
[2:15:34] <Captain_Doomsday> So Freddy has gross phantom length?
[2:15:35] <zeif00> Demo isn't as bad as people say he is though
[2:15:37] <Reizie_Etherealm> Tis weak to fire! Strength in numbers Arisen! Even in numbers, a weakling is a weakling still!
[2:15:42] <armchairmaster_> Dash destroys pallets, also he's spooky
[2:15:42] <+Soulbishop> Some one explain I read this before but I didn't understand how do you actually lunge?
[2:15:43] <Captain_Doomsday> I will find...A tier list. Of dubious quality.
[2:15:44] <Justlaxy> Demo lunge can be used as a bait during cchases @PatStaresAt
[2:15:46] <+MillerLowlife> twitter will never recover
[2:15:47] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Just look up whatever tierlist was the latest from Otzdarva
[2:15:49] <%Aleate> Tier lists are subjective Kappa
[2:15:49] <zeif00> It's just that nobody plays him
[2:15:56] <blackjackskellington> Too busy with Horse Dick
[2:15:59] <%Garthunox> is it a Jwong tier list?
[2:16:04] <armchairmaster_> "Pick a top tier, Pat" Kappa
[2:16:05] <%Typhaeon> His videos are pretty funny
[2:16:06] <zeif00> Otzdarva has amazing Killer guides
[2:16:08] <+Commiekin> Otz is a good killer streamer who has a tier list
[2:16:08] <%Typhaeon> Very good trapper
[2:16:11] <ThorW> Otzdarva is a killer main with like 3k hours
[2:16:13] <madskull456> its that trapper player
[2:16:15] <CoolguyMcdude> demo lunge can be used as bait just like huntress hatchets, you just prep it, then don't bother using it and basic attack
[2:16:15] <%Aleate> otzLove
[2:16:15] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt famous Dark Souls player
[2:16:16] <zenith0111> Movie tie in Characters aren't the reason people play... at least I hope
[2:16:16] <%heartlesshealer> game is up
[2:16:26] <studleydoorite> Otzdarva waiting room
[2:16:34] <+Remery_> make a butthole portal
[2:16:34] <+Soulbishop> Can someone send me that link to Otz channel in a pm I am trying to rank up
[2:16:38] <%heartlesshealer> oh right the portal shit
[2:16:40] <dinnydanny777> Otzdarva's username is an Armored Core reference I believe
[2:16:42] <GrandmasterBFunk> Pee Pee actuallly do be sounding like a real baby tho
[2:16:46] <+shinpete> How expensive is this game? It looks like there's like a 100 bucks worth of dlc
[2:16:48] <%Dementedpenguin> Demo is basically a mole monster
[2:16:50] <%huskarl_zap> ooh its Pazuzu from the magic the gathering universe
[2:16:54] <londorpaleale> ground sphincters DansGame
[2:16:57] <+IrishWeegee> rooBlind
[2:16:59] <armchairmaster_> Otz used to make good Dark Souls videos, made some DBD videos, but releases videos about as often as a Jontron video it feels like
[2:17:01] <%Valask> the cat screaming is my aesthetic
[2:17:05] <+klassikFrank> I like Demo, but playing with no perks feels bad on any killer I feel
[2:17:05] <%heartlesshealer> Welcome to Demo
[2:17:10] <ThorW> The blind cirBlind
[2:17:10] <dinnydanny777> Is that just an anus
[2:17:11] <%MajorCrasher> you can teleport between portals but you have to place them all manually and survivors can destroy them
[2:17:13] <zenith0111> So many players messing up gens
[2:17:15] <%AncelDeLambert> those traps?
[2:17:17] <MaritimeSpanker> oh man
[2:17:19] <dinnydanny777> That genuinely looks like an anus
[2:17:19] <MaritimeSpanker> imagine
[2:17:21] <%Starotter70> psaPorgmo_TK
[2:17:22] <MattDemers> Anyone play DbD Mobile? Curious how it is
[2:17:23] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Otzdarva has another channel "not Otzdarva", it has a lot of in-depth DBD shit
[2:17:23] <%Typhaeon> The ultimate power: to create a sphincter out of the ground
[2:17:24] <zeif00> Otzdarva posts more on his DBD channel, Not Otzdarva
[2:17:25] <londorpaleale> @AncelDeLambert teleport points
[2:17:30] <+Soulbishop> Oh for chat anyone on Gamepass for PC don't play Battle Mechs you cant save apparently.
[2:17:33] <%huskarl_zap> those astolfos?
[2:17:36] <CoolguyMcdude> if you're gonna follow otz, follow his second channel, its got like almost daily dbd vids
[2:17:36] <MaritimeSpanker> imagine if there was a hacker in the game right now
[2:17:39] <studleydoorite> @armchairmaster_ you know he streams a lot right?
[2:17:40] <CoolguyMcdude> usually with big brain stuff
[2:17:46] <%SovPho> Think it's a discord group?
[2:17:48] <+Remery_> yea the survivor side of watching him come out the portal is disgusting,
[2:17:51] <$ragingbrachy> yo what
[2:17:52] <dinnydanny777> That really does look like an anus
[2:17:54] <%AncelDeLambert> are they l like bear traps, can the be disabled?
[2:17:57] <%huskarl_zap> why not astolfo?
[2:17:57] <+MillerLowlife> grody
[2:18:00] <%BunnyEmperor> Rek'Sai
[2:18:03] <%SvenHolgersson> Get in that anus you sick freak
[2:18:10] <+IrishWeegee> @AncelDeLambert I believe only after they've been used
[2:18:12] <%huskarl_zap> Why not Felix?
[2:18:13] <%MajorCrasher> yeah portals can be destroyed
[2:18:15] <%JumboCrunchies> What does this guy's Mori animation do?
[2:18:16] <%el_boney> maybe they died of natural causes?
[2:18:21] <%de1ete_forever> Silent Hill 4 tie-in
[2:18:24] <%huskarl_zap> she kinda bad tho. thatbfrost?
[2:18:26] <%UvBenServed> So it's a Penis Head that spawn's linked anuses?
[2:18:32] <+IrishWeegee> @JumboCrunchies imagine a dog with a chew toy
[2:18:33] <Captain_Doomsday> Yes.
[2:18:34] <dinnydanny777> What is this clown farts music
[2:18:36] <zenith0111> High level DBD survivor gameplay folks
[2:18:42] <ABigPinkLion> Is demo just a worse freddy? 'cause freddy's teleport has almost no setup
[2:18:45] <+MillerLowlife> the way he paws at palettes is kinda cute
[2:18:46] <%heartlesshealer> oh pat
[2:18:47] <+Commiekin> Gotta charge up his M2 lunge
[2:18:52] <+ConLin_Arts_> what spooky lad is this?
[2:18:54] <$ragingbrachy> i feel like the demogorgon could very easily hop right over those pallets
[2:18:54] <Captain_Doomsday> I'm about to make my own Tier list tbh. I can't find one other than Dennis
[2:19:02] <+Commiekin> It's great when you get used to it
[2:19:06] <%heartlesshealer> skill gates on demo
[2:19:08] <dinnydanny777> This music seems really bad lmao
[2:19:09] <zeif00> It goes super far tho
[2:19:11] <venomfury86> Is the Demogorgon actually from the planet Uranus?
[2:19:14] <%MajorCrasher> it's like cannibal, you don't dash unless he's fully charged.
[2:19:19] <%AncelDeLambert> i wonder if this game will ever have that monster from that recent Half in the Bag episode
[2:19:21] <+Remery_> I love the Tuba/Trombone theme
[2:19:25] <amiavamp> It's like a garbage-tier xenomorph
[2:19:25] <DaKnightWarrior> The start up frames suck.
[2:19:30] <%SovPho> it's great if your target just walks in a straight line like a big dumb dumb
[2:19:33] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt Shred can be used to destroy a pallet so charge it when they run towards one and then leap at them
[2:19:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> oh is this the Demogorgon?
[2:19:35] <%huskarl_zap> ahh yes dwmogorgons worst nightmare a wooden palette
[2:19:40] <+Commiekin> Don't use your M2 lunge if you don't need it
[2:19:44] <%Aleate> This is always what happens when I try a new killer too FeelsBadMan
[2:19:50] <ABigPinkLion> Holy shit that was fast
[2:19:50] <Thewoodentree> Whoes this new werido hes playing
[2:19:54] <+Soulbishop> Otzdara? Nothing is showing up
[2:19:55] <zeif00> Oh shit they already have the gates open
[2:19:56] <+Commiekin> Also, great fucking pairing with Save The Best For Last. Shred doesn't eat tokens if you hit the obsession with it
[2:20:01] <%Nekros4442> WHAT WAS THAT GUYS PLAN
[2:20:02] <ThorW> Oh man, Pat's vs actually good survivors this time
[2:20:02] <GrandmasterBFunk> uhhh what was her plan?
[2:20:03] <wyrdboy21121> gens done LUL
[2:20:04] <%Nekros4442> THE HELL
[2:20:08] <armchairmaster_> Wait they're DONE?!
[2:20:09] <%huskarl_zap> When you go into chaos in dnd just drop palettes on the demon prince of deception
[2:20:12] <studleydoorite> ooh killer idea: Beetlejuice, he chases you around and tries to marry you
[2:20:14] <zenith0111> Welp looks like this was a fast match
[2:20:14] <$ragingbrachy> that was quick
[2:20:15] <%BunnyEmperor> already
[2:20:16] <wyrdboy21121> welcome to red ranks
[2:20:20] <+Remery_> yep red rankies
[2:20:21] <%Aleate> @Soulbishop Otzdarva otzLove
[2:20:23] <%AncelDeLambert> voice chat or no, place your bets
[2:20:24] <prime_name> That was quick
[2:20:25] <dinnydanny777> Like why would this guy stick people on meat hooks it's so weird
[2:20:27] <evilthecat17> The imagery of this eldritch monster needing to hang its victims on a hook is pretty silly
[2:20:28] <+Skelegroove> The maps in this seem to make a straight lunge pointless
[2:20:32] <MavrickHauntX1999> Gen Rushing O_o
[2:20:32] <Captain_Doomsday> Red ranks are always voice chat
[2:20:33] <dinnydanny777> He's a big monster
[2:20:39] <ABigPinkLion> note to self, don't buy demo
[2:20:43] <+Soulbishop> Yeah someone hit me with the link
[2:20:47] <%AncelDeLambert> that was nice of him
[2:20:48] <$ragingbrachy> FeelsBadMan
[2:20:48] <SomeOtherNeb> yeah that sucked
[2:20:52] <Captain_Doomsday> Yes, that's the usual experience.
[2:20:52] <$ragingbrachy> i wont :)
[2:20:55] <%Mister_McDerp> how does flashlight work? it has no eyes
[2:20:57] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt If you have an ability that loses stacks when you attack the obsession, using shred won't lose you stacks
[2:20:59] <+Commiekin> Demogorgon's better than Doctor and Clown
[2:21:01] <+klassikFrank> Demo's not bad, this is your second game with him?
[2:21:03] <+IrishWeegee> yeah, demi is a hard learn
[2:21:03] <+ROBOSAPION6499> I love demogorgon
[2:21:06] <madgalvanizer> Man this killer sucks
[2:21:06] <takokasa> Demogorgon is a Huntress that throws his entire body, so it's way more punishing to miss
[2:21:06] <%CursedNobleman> Plague looks cool
[2:21:06] <%Jekado> wow this "hero" sucks
[2:21:08] <$Afterman_> play spirit-chan
[2:21:08] <ThorW> @ABigPinkLion Demo is pretty good overall. He's above average. Pat doesn't know how to play him and is against very fast players
[2:21:08] <+RiseRequiem> what do the survivors do/what is their objective?
[2:21:09] <Sleepless_Dawn> Demo's good, you just need to practice him
[2:21:11] <dinnydanny777> Just use your anus portal powers
[2:21:11] <%DensityD> FeelsBadMan cvHazmat
[2:21:12] <%huskarl_zap> Out smarting the demon prince of deception smh
[2:21:12] <+duckpuncher49> i like how he ree's after every hit
[2:21:13] <%SvenHolgersson> Demigorgon is about as good as the most recent season of ST it seems
[2:21:13] <Captain_Doomsday> That's not a Demogorgon thing, that's a red ranks thing
[2:21:13] <eco419> Classic pat
[2:21:14] <zenith0111> High level DBD is pretty lame
[2:21:16] <Byr0nX> use da portals
[2:21:17] <+pectusumbra> no way, we saw doctor earlier and he was great
[2:21:17] <%de1ete_forever> there was a anus here, it's gone now
[2:21:20] <$Trenr> he's not very good
[2:21:21] <venomfury86> meh
[2:21:23] <+Estuko> he runs funny
[2:21:23] <+klassikFrank> BBQ, STBFL, Discordance, and whateve ris really good on him
[2:21:23] <Captain_Doomsday> You're reaching the point where fun is not allowed, Pat.
[2:21:24] <%MajorCrasher> I like Demo but he really needs work
[2:21:25] <%Scooterbug9000> damn
[2:21:25] <+MillerLowlife> gotta upgrade to the full version gorgon
[2:21:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> Wooliehole
[2:21:28] <+suspence15> He difficult to use
[2:21:29] <+demon1103> in all fairness, that was your fist game as him...and they got those generators kinda quick
[2:21:30] <%DensityD> LUL
[2:21:31] <%CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:21:31] <Captain_Doomsday> Check their perks!
[2:21:33] <Thewoodentree> Why can,t we have a good freakazoid monster that isnt just a dude with a knife or stiick?
[2:21:36] <%DensityD> put on hook
[2:21:36] <armchairmaster_> @skelegroove some lunge characters have pretty good utility (such as Billy and i forget which else) but demo is just BAD
[2:21:38] <+klassikFrank> Demo is so much better than most M1 killers
[2:21:39] <$ragingbrachy> da alien
[2:21:39] <%DensityD> 'no
[2:21:40] <$Trenr> like oh no he can portal, but then he does and everyone on the map knows they've ok to do stuff
[2:21:44] <catwithsunglasses> ah, yes, this is the level of lame high level DbD reaches
[2:21:46] <+duckpuncher49> demogorgon is entity's pet
[2:21:47] <$Afterman_> play oni!
[2:21:47] <%CrazyMedicine> The Alien is the hook
[2:21:49] <+Commiekin> @pectusumbra He's really not. His power is to get people to drop pallets early basically. Demo's power is to hit them before they even get there.
[2:21:50] <catwithsunglasses> I remember it fondly
[2:21:52] <%DensityD> him and/or her
[2:21:52] <+Scevda> There should be an Owl alien ala 4th kind
[2:21:53] <+klassikFrank> Demo's definitely better than Legion
[2:21:57] <+duckpuncher49> legion time PogChamp
[2:21:58] <$ragingbrachy> üé∏
[2:22:00] <+ConLin_Arts_> is that NOT-Jason?
[2:22:00] <%Starotter70> "No, no, no, STOP eating them, PUT them on the HOOK DAMN IT!"
[2:22:03] <closetgremlin12> angsty teen time
[2:22:04] <%DensityD> scream
[2:22:04] <$Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt how the fuck would Chuck pick people up and throw them on the hook?
[2:22:04] <%Scooterbug9000> psaWink
[2:22:04] <%de1ete_forever> psaGib
[2:22:05] <trianglehat> for alien replace hook with egg hatching wall
[2:22:09] <%AncelDeLambert> wouldn't the Alien drag you to an egg, not a hook?
[2:22:11] <zeif00> I find Legion to be better than Demo tbh
[2:22:12] <%FaderPotater> i mean aliens are constantly hanging people places. just with spittle
[2:22:12] <+xmetalicdemonx> the demogrodeon couldnt kill a bunch of children. Therefore= BAD
[2:22:14] <Zombrocom> When legion was announced I thought he would be able to disguise himself as a survivor
[2:22:15] <shurtal> cat time cat time cat time

[2:22:19] <smallheals> Punch That pussy
[2:22:19] <Drusain> Hi Steve Bushemi
[2:22:19] <%thepaintedring> is this killer just a random dude in a hoodie?
[2:22:20] <armchairmaster_> If the entity was smart they'd just use their spider legs to get the people NotLikeThis
[2:22:20] <+ConLin_Arts_> or is this NOT-Purge?
[2:22:21] <fabo_joyful> psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep
[2:22:24] <%yoshkosh20> is this killer just a dude with a knife?
[2:22:24] <ABigPinkLion> @ThorW I'm sure it can be, it just looks awkward plus I'd rather just go for freddy for the teleport ability
[2:22:25] <%huskarl_zap> Why not Grizzt instead?
[2:22:27] <%Aleate> Stab those kids otzLurk
[2:22:28] <zenith0111> @zeif00 Oof. The meme that is Legion?
[2:22:28] <%Scooterbug9000> i saw jelly beans
[2:22:32] <%AncelDeLambert> The Alien would just infect you with a chest burster
[2:22:32] <GrandmasterBFunk> i'd argue that Demo is being controlled/instructed by the mindflayer, who is actually intelligent, and working with the entity
[2:22:33] <%Starotter70> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[2:22:34] <%TrevIn3Dimensions> @PatStaresAt so is this purge guy just "what if a survivor became a killer?"
[2:22:35] <%DedlokPM> They could probably change the Demogorgon and give him his own special hook like Pyramidhead
[2:22:36] <+Commiekin> Legion is Not-Ghostface, not Purge at all
[2:22:37] <+ConLin_Arts_> BABY
[2:22:38] <SomeOtherNeb> HE ESCAPE
[2:22:40] <+Scevda> Elmo becoming senile
[2:22:41] <%Binary_Fireball> CAT BATTLE
[2:22:43] <%CrazyMedicine> they should add Xenomorph and Vergil
[2:22:43] <%DedlokPM> that would work in line with show lore
[2:22:44] <ThorW> @ABigPinkLion Oh Freddy is definitely better. Jsut saying Demo isn't bad
[2:22:48] <+The_Protagonist> psaWink psaWink psaWink

[2:22:52] <%DensityD> does the baby smell?
[2:22:53] <caja_de_ojos> how is paige doing?
[2:22:53] <$Afterman_> freddy is op
[2:22:55] <%Aleate> FREE ELMO psaGib
[2:22:57] <%yoshkosh20> elmo loves the danger
[2:22:57] <%huskarl_zap> the hacker known as 4chan?
[2:22:58] <%Starotter70> LUL
[2:23:02] <Malisin_Murder> He ran away FeelsBadMan
[2:23:02] <%king_wragles> @AncelDeLambert I mean, all the killers are summoned and controlled by The Entity. You can just use the lore to hand waive any plot contrivance

[2:23:22] <+Soulbishop> Chuckie is technically magic so what @GameOver_Here said
[2:23:22] <GrandmasterBFunk> all of the hooks start super low
[2:23:23] <Thewoodentree> He would call in his wife and son for an assist
[2:23:23] <+xmetalicdemonx> he pulls out a ladder
[2:23:26] <%huskarl_zap> Why not cartoon cat?
[2:23:26] <%king_wragles> he'd drag them to the hook and just use a pulley system or whatever
[2:23:26] <$ragingbrachy> you dreamed the pulley up

[2:23:45] <%Treuan> Maybe he jumps on them and drags them around like a Jockey?
[2:23:48] <$Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt maybe for Chucky it wouldnt be a hook, he gets a special kill device?

[2:23:56] <%heartlesshealer> Leprechaun has too much range of bullshit to pull from to narrow it down and satisfy anyone
[2:23:58] <Dr_Suddenboner> they should put that guy from exorcist 3 in there
[2:24:02] <blackjackskellington> Chucky could drag them and throw them on the hook from below
[2:24:03] <+Soulbishop> Wait what time is it there its already 6 in florida

[2:34:11] <%king_wragles> Mr. X would be slow, and could just walk through pallets. His draw back would be that he has nothing that's really active.
[2:34:11] <ursusbearrammage> it might be the same issue with jason having his own game since re resistance exists

[2:41:55] <%linSP> Add a skeleman
[2:41:56] <smallheals> that one crackhead near the dollarstore
[2:41:58] <TomFrank> Ted Cruz from the 2016 US primaries
[2:41:58] <ThorW> No he won't. Pyramid head is gonna wind up mid tier, maybe a little above. 100%
[2:41:58] <%bustawof> a spooky skeleton would be really cool actually
[2:42:00] <FlongBongle> Invalidin
[2:42:00] <%spiritofmojave> ZAAT THO
[2:42:01] <thewhiterice92> They should add that spaceman from Scooby Doo
[2:42:01] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt what about Creepypasta Big Eye Squidward.
[2:42:03] <dinnydanny777> They should add Ghost Man
[2:42:05] <%Scooterbug9000> too stronk
[2:42:05] <+OwlLightningMage> The Batman who Laughs and jerks off
[2:42:05] <erknen> you think people know how to dodge!?

[2:42:17] <ThorW> Probably a bit above mid tier, but he won't be op
[2:42:17] <+bullethart> im so happy they went with the SH2 design for pyramid head
[2:42:20] <+taltalheights> Hobo with handful of syringes-man
[2:42:21] <yaboyregret> Siren head would be pretty dope.
[2:42:21] <zeif00> Paige you don't have any reaction time so of course you think it's op
[2:42:21] <%Alaster101> all killers need buffs
[2:42:25] <%el_boney> what about 'a series of unfortunate coincidences'. that could be a good killer
[2:42:27] <%huskarl_zap> Fahkuraam from tekken 7
[2:42:27] <%Mister_McDerp> the Invisible Man would be the best killer
[2:42:29] <%Binary_Fireball> we've seen that from your darksouls playthrough
[2:42:32] <Captain_Doomsday> Pyramid Head is normal speed. No mobility boost, no high-tier.
[2:42:36] <ThorW> Nurse, Spirit, Billy are still way better
[2:42:38] <@SoFarFetched> Paige we should play DbD together one of these days.
[2:42:38] <venomfury86> Too stronk
[2:42:40] <blackjackskellington> Joe
[2:42:40] <mitchellb2597> Don‚Äôt you think that garbage killers would ruin the game? New additions are definitely cool but I feel like quality characters are better than quantity. Variety matters too like what you guys are saying
[2:42:40] <$Afterman_> I heard his cage thing kind of sucks
[2:42:40] <%Frost_Quill> DODGE

[2:42:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Batman with massive heartache
[2:42:41] <%CrazyMedicine> Moogles from Final fantasy could be a great killer
[2:42:43] <madgalvanizer> Heihachi killer
[2:42:46] <JoeBecomesJoe> Even billy?
[2:42:48] <dinnydanny777> They should add Eileen the Crow
[2:42:50] <@SoFarFetched> BILLY
[2:42:50] <smallheals> YESSS IT SHOULD BE SYRINGE GUY
[2:42:51] <Captain_Doomsday> Pat's right. That'd help a ton
[2:42:53] <hoopray> but Survivor mains get angry
[2:42:53] <%Taisuru> Tonberry for next killer
[2:42:53] <ThorW> Billy is top 3
[2:42:54] <zeif00> Billy is totally better
[2:42:54] <TomFrank> the burger king
[2:42:54] <%spiritofmojave> BEELY
[2:42:54] <%Starotter70> Billeh
[2:42:55] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Billy is top tier

[2:43:09] <Thewoodentree> Pat really likes getting done quick
[2:43:11] <zeif00> Fast killers interupt gens
[2:43:11] <%Aleate> PogChamp
[2:43:12] <%boomstickery> speed most important thing in combat along with range but thats because space adn time are linked
[2:43:12] <+Remery_> Must pressure survivors
[2:43:13] <KidKaiser23> Tonberry if you really nasty
[2:43:14] <%de1ete_forever> snathced
[2:43:14] <Animal_Farm4> How fast you can traverse the map is directly related to how powerful you are as a killer
[2:43:15] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Nurse, Spirit, Billy
[2:43:15] <DrkJP520> Jack Baker as killer

[2:43:24] <%scrumbotime> GOTCHA
[2:43:25] <Animal_Farm4> followed immediately by what you can do to deal with pallet loops
[2:43:25] <+Skelegroove> Spirit seems crazy good
[2:43:26] <+Javaa01> Well that was free
[2:43:26] <%spiritofmojave> Tonberry would be terrifying
[2:43:28] <ThorW> Mobility and fast ways to deal with pallets/loops are king for Killers. Billy has both
[2:43:29] <KidKaiser23> I wish Silent Hills had been made so we could have Lisa

[2:43:56] <+StooEsq> Dead by Daylight is less of a game and more of a social experiment
[2:43:56] <+MillerLowlife> add mad survivor player as a killer
[2:43:56] <xCuteLittleAngelx> I've been called an E Girl twice by my survivor teammates

[2:49:24] <%Valdorick> There's a thing called "being a claudette", you never want that described of yourself.
[2:49:32] <+pokp0k> also instead of tbagging go to the next loop, and don't waste pallets as well.
[2:49:32] <FlongBongle> VAC
[2:49:39] <venomfury86> after DS2 she should stream Demon's Souls
[2:49:40] <+ragingbrachy> üìù dont be paige
[2:49:42] <Samaugsch2> @choculaultra The only time i attempt to rescue survivors is if the killer isn‚Äôt nearby
[2:49:46] <%kyh9> as a serial killer
[2:49:47] <%de1ete_forever> role player Paige
[2:49:48] <madskull456> if you think the killer can see you through walls, then they probably can cause perks
[2:49:49] <+OwlLightningMage> A mimic killer
[2:49:50] <Animal_Farm4> Immersed survivors are actually the WORST
[2:49:55] <ChoculaUltra> @Samaugsch2 you're off to a solid start

[2:50:20] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Otzdarva is a killer main, not a survivor main
[2:50:20] <SainEdge> or just have fun with the videogame LUL
[2:50:21] <%kyh9> Wait, what is the point of the Flash Light? Doesnt it give away your position?
[2:50:21] <%heartlesshealer> Q Hayashida works are great
[2:50:25] <studleydoorite> Otzdatztdavtrzda
[2:50:25] <+zepelinnn1> No0b3 is a good one
[2:50:28] <@SoFarFetched> @kyh9 blinds the killer for a bit and has them drop the survivor they are holding
[2:50:29] <Captain_Doomsday> 6 hour video.
[2:50:30] <+AXL808> expect the jank 10 ft slash attack
[2:50:30] <%Frost_Quill> Imagine full future immersive vr games like this.
[2:50:31] <danknugglit> Otz
[2:50:34] <+bugz_munny> He has fantastic Souls content
[2:50:34] <%Alaster101> biggest tip is domt play survivor it sucks
[2:50:36] <+pokp0k> flashlight is for blinding or possibly flashlight save
[2:50:36] <%bevyrage> @Soulbishop yeah you gotta shine the flashlight into their face, so they gotta be looking at you to do it
[2:50:36] <zeif00> Otz is great
[2:50:38] <+demon1103> Just remember #1 rule of Survivor: if you lost, its only because the killer camped & tunneled XD
[2:50:38] <ChoculaUltra> someone told me that Otzdarva was the Brozime of DbD LUL
[2:50:42] <dinnydanny777> Otzdarva's name is a reference to a character from Armored Core for Answer I think
[2:50:43] <+ragingbrachy> call a flower ‚òéÔ∏è
[2:50:47] <DrkJP520> The psycho that chops peoples' dicks off in the Outlast dlc as the killer.
[2:50:54] <Faultlined> Vinc3ntvega is a good one to look at too
[2:50:56] <+Soulbishop> @bevyrage til
[2:50:57] <@SoFarFetched> Ive been mainly playing Meg too.
[2:50:57] <+Scevda> SHUT IT MEG
[2:50:59] <%NeoCre> Otz and Tru3 are both good ones
[2:50:59] <venomfury86> Ostrava?!
[2:51:04] <%huskarl_zap> Mega from family guy?
[2:51:04] <%Spydurman> @PatStaresAt Hey Paige what about rebranding as the Ruby Peach?
[2:51:06] <%ShootThatZombie> Have you heard of Ohmwrecker?
[2:51:08] <Captain_Doomsday> I can't believe y'all are going to convince me to play this game again
[2:51:12] <%driemen> for survivors, the biggest skill you need to pick up is how to not instantly eat shit when you get spotted
[2:51:14] <@SoFarFetched> no but do it
[2:51:17] <%driemen> The game is spooky, so its hard
[2:51:21] <Captain_Doomsday> Ohm's cool! He's one of the only people who covered Last Year
[2:51:22] <%huskarl_zap> HEY BETER
[2:51:26] <%Valdorick> She got dem loops, brother
[2:51:27] <%ShootThatZombie> he's pretty good at it too
[2:51:30] <+Soulbishop> Ohmwrecker played something else but I cant remember what. @ShootThatZombie
[2:51:41] <%NeoCre> tru3ta1ent Is good one, he plays both sides equally
[2:51:51] <Captain_Doomsday> I have too much anxiety to enjoy Killer and find Surv boring, so it's a weird addiction spot for me.
[2:51:52] <%kyh9> Wait, you can use the Flashlight to attack and blind the killer? Crazy
[2:51:54] <%JumboCrunchies> Try to remember not to just sprint everywhere. Half the time as a Killer, I find people because they are sprinting for no reason and leaving scratches.
[2:51:56] <%Starotter70> I would give it a try but my internet is trash
[2:51:57] <%Frost_Quill> So what's Pyramid Head's motivation for going along with the Entity? He never seemed outright evil.
[2:52:00] <%ShootThatZombie> @soulbishop he used to play a lot of Friday the 13th too
[2:52:04] <Faultlined> Vinc3entVega is a good one too!
[2:52:06] <%JumboCrunchies> Go ahead and run away, but once you think you're clear stop running.
[2:52:07] <+bullethart> bullethart subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:52:09] <xCuteLittleAngelx> I love Ohmwrecker
[2:52:10] <zeif00> OhTofu is great too
[2:52:13] <%Scooterbug9000> swag_dracula is really good too
[2:52:13] <dinnydanny777> They should add Walker from Spec Ops The Line, his gimmick is having a gun
[2:52:14] <%driemen> Pallet + flashlight is like a 10 second headstart
[2:52:21] <Captain_Doomsday> Tru3 has a video where he ONLY takes instadown hatchets and everyone DCs on him.
[2:52:22] <%kyh9> That's not mentioned ANYWHERE in its description
[2:52:23] <Captain_Doomsday> So that's fun
[2:52:23] <DrkJP520> @PatStaresAt You think you'll ever stream W101 remastered?
[2:52:30] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:52:32] <%s_xylocalsingles> Ohmwrecker was an OG League of Legends player who had an item named after him.
[2:52:33] <+AXL808> i totally suck with flashlight
[2:52:35] <@SoFarFetched> she was like "byeeee"
[2:52:35] <Nomad_Scholar> That walk
[2:52:38] <MavrickHauntX1999> that run tho
[2:52:38] <%huskarl_zap> lol at that animation
[2:52:40] <+ragingbrachy> you were a ruthless killler
[2:52:40] <Captain_Doomsday> Don't flashlight after a pallet hit. It's BM and LOSES ground.

[2:52:58] <%driemen> Your goal as survivor is either A. waste killer time or B. complete objectives or C. assist friends -- which you're doing can change throughout the match

[2:53:50] <%huskarl_zap> skyrim mod character
[2:53:54] <+demon1103> I like Huntress, she cool
[2:54:00] <+ragingbrachy> ONLY. ONCE.
[2:54:02] <dinnydanny777> Is this Mjoll
[2:54:03] <@SoFarFetched> good to know
[2:54:05] <+The_Butterfly_Man> prestige was in it since pretty much the start and it took forever
[2:54:09] <%MrBorisMakarov> huntress is great
[2:54:12] <dinnydanny777> Is this Mjoll from Riften
[2:54:13] <+IrishWeegee> save up a bunch of bp before prestige
[2:54:14] <Captain_Doomsday> Prestige is off the table until EVERYONE is 50
[2:54:17] <%Starotter70> Will Paige give honorary Oinks for the Huntress?
[2:54:21] <+ragingbrachy> blood, huh.
[2:54:25] <xCuteLittleAngelx> Dont they still get perks after 50?
[2:54:27] <jestrfestr> you always spend BP for addons
[2:54:28] <Animal_Farm4> You get a bloody weapon/head/outfit
[2:54:28] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, it's kiiiiiinda worthless
[2:54:31] <%riderstrike152> You Pat and Paige, how often to people f up your names when meeting or hearing of you for the first time? For instance I pronounced Pat's last name as "Bovine" and though Paige was "PeachSalvia". I have since learned
[2:54:34] <Ericgi231> Prestige also gives that character a slightly higher chance of getting good items on level up
[2:54:39] <+ragingbrachy> what if he sucks
[2:54:40] <+coldsama> Huntress have the best costumes in the game
[2:54:42] <Captain_Doomsday> If you CRAVE the blood head, I respect it.
[2:54:43] <%NeoCre> You still get perks after 50
[2:54:44] <%huskarl_zap> Reggie from the Woolie versus universe
[2:54:45] <GrandmasterBFunk> SHOW. THE. BABY.
[2:54:45] <+Soulbishop> How much do we have to pay to get a tactics style game one v one with you? Sorry if that sounds too forward.
[2:54:47] <%Frost_Quill> Your reward is fashion, the highest priority in multiplayer games.
[2:54:48] <DrkJP520> Is that Sonic Fox?
[2:54:56] <Captain_Doomsday> That's not true.
[2:55:02] <Captain_Doomsday> There's like a .01% difference
[2:55:08] <SomeOtherNeb> LUL
[2:55:11] <dinnydanny777> @huskarl_zap His gimmick is wanting feet
[2:55:14] <%JumboCrunchies> Prestige if you actually wanna play the killer and you get crap perks.
[2:55:14] <+Skelegroove> Why even bother
[2:55:15] <DrkJP520> nvm that's a boar
[2:55:21] <%alcors_wisdom> so youre saying theres a chance

[2:55:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Is head not first?
[2:55:32] <%NeoCre> Once you hit 50, you get 4 perks to choose from each web

[2:55:55] <%driemen> weap body head
[2:56:02] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @PatStaresAt leveling at the start was not quick it too a while so much so that they made it if you prestiged with the old system you got cool glowing cosmetics called legacy skins
[2:56:04] <+AXL808> i want Heather's perks, then prestige
[2:56:05] <Solidnick18> yeah
[2:56:08] <rcand9> raise hands who actually beat AC: Odyssey? that game is too loooooong
[2:56:10] <HalloweenHangover> Leatherface works too.

[2:56:53] <spongeofmystery> I'm playing Odyssey right now as it was on sale
[2:56:59] <Captain_Doomsday> The blood effect tends to be pretty limp, but there's a DbD wiki.
[2:56:59] <%Treuan> Looks like it's on the wiki
[2:57:00] <%JumboCrunchies> Isnt the head the Hexagonal head instead of the default 4-sided pyramid?

[2:59:06] <+coldsama> the best update in this game was when they finally made the humming continue for it's full 5 minutes instead of resetting after every action

[2:59:26] <@SoFarFetched> Time to Bury the Hatchet
[2:59:32] <Captain_Doomsday> Hatchets tend to be easy hits when someone's animation-locked dropping a pallet.
[2:59:35] <%Scooterbug9000> stop @SoFarFetched
[2:59:38] <%Valdorick> Oh that's rad.
[2:59:38] <danknugglit> Good thing nobody say that
[2:59:41] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt CHANNEL YOUR INNER MATT! psaWhat
[2:59:43] <%huskarl_zap> no one in this chat has used a axe ever
[2:59:43] <+Remery_> The humming is very addicting :)
[2:59:46] <%MajorCrasher> this is why Pat thinks she's bad. he's using hatchets wrong
[2:59:47] <%Valdorick> also, yeah, FarFetched, Binch yourself.
[2:59:48] <Captain_Doomsday> You can hit someone on the other side of a gen if they're working on it because of hitbox weirdness
[2:59:53] <+Turkweiss> Man, I got so sick of getting teabagged by toxic survivors in this game that I started to exclusively play nurse. Revenge is sweet but now I just feel empty
[2:59:54] <londorpaleale> give knife me please

[3:00:02] <%Gogogolem> oh you're playing my favorite killer

[3:00:06] <@SoFarFetched> sipsipDab I am immunes to the binching,but believe in your heart that Im binched
[3:00:11] <%stygianlord> do the survivors hear her humming?
[3:00:12] <%DatGuyJimbo> just skillshot it from across the map pfft
[3:00:14] <%MajorCrasher> the best time to hatchet is when they're looping or vaulting
[3:00:15] <%Mendin> Yes
[3:00:19] <%AncelDeLambert> this isnt Huntress who is this
[3:00:20] <Ipsenscastle> I see you've played knifey coiny before
[3:00:23] <%DedlokPM> @stygianlord yes
[3:00:24] <%Mendin> They hear it further out than her terror radius, even
[3:00:25] <%Valdorick> I'm believing but it isn't happening.
[3:00:29] <+Soulbishop> Actually for all of chat. Whats the hardest part of being engaged to a gamer if you do not both play the same games?
[3:00:36] <%DedlokPM> @AncelDeLambert Huntrress
[3:00:40] <SomeOtherNeb> that one was close
[3:00:41] <+Scevda> misssssss
[3:00:47] <%stygianlord> Hearing the humming as a survivor is a super coll mechanic
[3:00:50] <%AncelDeLambert> I dont hear humming
[3:00:51] <Ipsenscastle> this would be the lamest horror movie

[3:01:15] <SainEdge> PogChamp
[3:01:18] <@SoFarFetched> @Soulbishop as long as you both got some common games to play with that's fine. But if you both respect the other for playing games you don't play it's fine. Just as long as they are having fun.
[3:01:20] <$Afterman_> If you wanna learn to be a sick huntress, check out Scott Jund's videos
[3:01:29] <zeif00> Panic Dead Hard'd
[3:01:34] <%AncelDeLambert> look at that lag
[3:01:40] <%Mendin> You hear a little "shing" when the hatcet is fully wound up
[3:01:43] <+Remery_> I think they used Dead Hard
[3:01:45] <@SoFarFetched> Pat was too focused on dailies LUL
[3:01:48] <+coldsama> was that a lag switch?
[3:01:52] <+Soulbishop> RE games are our shit @SoFarFetched since highschool
[3:01:53] <$Afterman_> now face camp him
[3:01:59] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt The hatchets have a smaller collision box for the environment and larger for people. You can hit people around corners usually if you're at a rock/tires like that
[3:01:59] <+xmetalicdemonx> Yo I just got my first salty message for this game.
[3:02:04] <+ragingbrachy> no
[3:02:07] <+Scevda> Saying Please in French wont help either.
[3:02:10] <Solidnick18> wooo
[3:02:25] <%MajorCrasher> God this hurts to watch
[3:02:27] <%DedlokPM> @AncelDeLambert Nah. That was dead heard. a brief burst of speed that you can do when hurt. has a cooldown afterwards
[3:02:28] <%NeoCre> @anceldelambert If you aim the axe long enough, the *shing* sound will play and it will fly far faster and in a much straighter line
[3:02:31] <SomeOtherNeb> that sounds like RE5 music
[3:02:38] <%Starotter70> BILL

[3:23:36] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt you really need to stop kicking generators. The degen rate is 1/4 of 1 survivor doing a gen. It's not worht the time
[3:23:42] <+Commiekin> the trick with bubba is you are as good at him from the start as you basically ever will be
[3:23:45] <%huskarl_zap> Whens bubbahotep?

[3:25:10] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[3:25:10] <+ragingbrachy> theres no way it wont cost under 600
[3:25:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> you can't beat stupid

[3:25:16] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm not paying that shit
[3:25:18] <dinnydanny777> I could just buy a gaming computer
[3:25:20] <@SoFarFetched> BUT HER MIND WASNT
[3:25:21] <ItIsSky> ps3 prices
[3:25:22] <ThatButler> So, it's the PS3 price all over again?
[3:25:22] <Malisin_Murder> . .
[3:25:23] <ahandsomegentleman> heygang, hope you're all staying safe
[3:25:23] <%Shadicara> I'll upgrade my pc for 699 thanks Kappa
[3:25:25] <%DedlokPM> @lethallylactic It's more than likely a placeholder
[3:25:25] <j0ustar> 700 what version? THAT'S the important part
[3:25:28] <%Taisuru> Member when nobody bought the PS3 for 599?
[3:25:28] <%Soulbishop> USD or CAD?
[3:25:31] <%Mittastic> pat how did you expect to beat her at "i win"
[3:25:33] <+coldsama> that's a placeholder apparently unless Sony confirmed?
[3:25:34] <+zepelinnn1> we need Chad Warden again
[3:25:37] <%de1ete_forever> i will also upgrade my PC
[3:25:37] <+OwlLightningMage> I could buy a PC for that price
[3:25:38] <+chimaera24> It's a placeholder price guys
[3:25:38] <%BubbaRands> yeah 699 better be for the bundle or i'm suing
[3:25:42] <+Javaa01> It'll run PS4 games
[3:25:42] <BlkFlameKami> NOT BALLIN
[3:25:43] <%DedlokPM> @j0ustar Placeholder price version at playasia
[3:25:43] <%Starotter70> Not even for the 360
[3:25:45] <dinnydanny777> Oh I bet the disc version is 800
[3:25:46] <+zepelinnn1> Chad Warden wipes his ass with 699 dollars
[3:25:46] <+Javaa01> But not beyond that
[3:25:48] <mak0t0yukii> Isn't a placeholder for now
[3:25:49] <+jacintafor> 599 at most i'm paying
[3:25:50] <%huskarl_zap> video games are dead
[3:25:53] <+Jordanak13> Thats not the price, and it is backwards compatible
[3:25:54] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> it actually kills your ps4
[3:25:57] <%thegreenbenis> BIG DOUBT
[3:25:57] <%Mister_McDerp> who knows
[3:25:58] <%mckraven> Didn't yall watch the ps5 tech talk they said it was back compat with at least ps4
[3:26:00] <GrandmasterBFunk> "some" PS4 games
[3:26:01] <SomeOtherNeb> AAAAAAAaaaaah
[3:26:02] <%de1ete_forever> i could get a CPU, GPU, motherboard, and PSU for that price
[3:26:02] <%Jekado> will it even run ps5 games
[3:26:05] <%king_wragles> LUL
[3:26:05] <%Taisuru> It will run PS4 games they confirmed
[3:26:06] <+AXL808> it costs so much because it was made by Seto Kaiba
[3:26:06] <dinnydanny777> The disc version probably costs an extra hundred to be backwards compatible
[3:26:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Countdown to the Emulator
[3:26:09] <%heartlesshealer> They'll probably remove backwards compatibility three months in
[3:26:10] <+OwlLightningMage> It shoots your ps4 games in the face
[3:26:10] <ThorW> They did take the backwards compatable off the website
[3:26:10] <+pectusumbra> they literally removed that from their marketing
[3:26:10] <londorpaleale> Is DeS a launch title?
[3:26:10] <%M4T1A5> They already confirmed it will run most of them at launch
[3:26:11] <DelgotHansto> Not even backwards compatible with the saga saturn
[3:26:11] <j0ustar> @DedlokPM no info if disc/digital at all?
[3:26:12] <%Keyd00d> Only the "best" ps4 games
[3:26:13] <%huskarl_zap> PS4HASNOGAMESEITHER
[3:26:13] <%UvBenServed> It seemed like they we teasing ps4 games, but probably only some
[3:26:14] <%king_wragles> Get JUKED
[3:26:15] <%thegreenbenis> I DOUBT IT
[3:26:18] <%Mister_McDerp> that sucks
[3:26:20] <ItIsSky> the industry guess floating around is 499-599, difference of 50 dollars between the disc and discless versions
[3:26:20] <viewtifulr> only gta5
[3:26:20] <%Shadicara> Nah it's still bad
[3:26:21] <%weissguard> Especially with 1st model foibles. Buying a console on launch is a trap.
[3:26:22] <+jacintafor> they removed the ps4 thing as a selling point on their website
[3:26:22] <+Javaa01> It'll play all PS4 games, but only SOME will run enhanced
[3:26:23] <+sizableidiot> they say "some" so you cant sue them if one of them doesnt work
[3:26:23] <%MSN04_Sazabi> """"SOME""""
[3:26:23] <%Taisuru> @GrandmasterBFunk It will RUN all of them, it will run SOME of them better
[3:26:24] <%Keyd00d> It better play BLOODBORNE
[3:26:25] <LoneFonte> It will run bloodborne
[3:26:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hows the PS5 Emulator gonna be lit when it leaks first week
[3:26:29] <%Starotter70> BILL
[3:26:31] <%MrBorisMakarov> so apparently they released a KFC console trailer? atpRtsd
[3:26:31] <%haitakaa> it will only run Vita games
[3:26:31] <%spiritofmojave> only the PS4 and just SOME? that's garbage
[3:26:32] <%Mittastic> BILL BILL BILL BILL
[3:26:35] <%gimmickypizza> it's going to run 4,000 PS4 games Pat
[3:26:35] <@SoFarFetched> He's even got a nice chrsitams sweater LU
[3:26:37] <@SoFarFetched> LUL *
[3:26:37] <+pkdragoon> its prob gonna be like xbox where they start wit some and gradually add more
[3:26:38] <+chimaera24> @PatStaresAt all ps4 games are back compat, some have a boosted mode and the price is a placeholder
[3:26:41] <%ospreyworks> NO BILLY
[3:26:41] <%Tyndarian> Only the disk-less PS5 will run PS4 games, but only if you have the disk
[3:26:44] <+Javaa01> Most games will just run as they did as they did on a regular ass PS4
[3:26:44] <+Commiekin> look down or up instead of left or right
[3:26:45] <%spiritofmojave> not worth the monnn
[3:26:47] <venomfury86> it can't be with ps3 because of the CELL processor
[3:26:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Its VERY up in the air RN... sucks
[3:26:50] <%juxtest> The devs will hunt you down if they find out you have PS3 games
[3:26:50] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:26:53] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:26:53] <danknugglit> LUL
[3:26:54] <%huskarl_zap> still not worth over 300 though
[3:26:54] <Dr_Suddenboner> all ps4 games should be compatible, but the boost in performance might cause issues
[3:26:55] <%BubbaRands> "SOME" meaning FF VII:Re and nothing else LUL

[3:27:06] <%alcors_wisdom> spec'd for rz
[3:27:07] <dinnydanny777> It can't run PS3 games? Shit my PS3 games are still unusable then
[3:27:09] <SomeOtherNeb> MICHAEL!
[3:27:10] <%DedlokPM> @j0ustar I didn't look that deep into it as it is more than likely a placeholder price as it hasn't been offfcially announced yet
[3:27:11] <GrandmasterBFunk> pills here
[3:27:13] <%Keyd00d> It will run Knack
[3:27:13] <graemecrackers2> So what is the PS5 in CAD?
[3:27:13] <%Frost_Quill> Insta heal. It's a perk.
[3:27:17] <%Keyd00d> and Knack 2
[3:27:19] <venomfury86> around 100 games were tested
[3:27:20] <+demon1103> ...theres some serious jank in this round
[3:27:22] <%Keyd00d> and that's it
[3:27:26] <%Frost_Quill> Or not lol I don't play survivor.
[3:27:26] <SomeOtherNeb> why does your killer sound like the average Twitter user
[3:27:28] <+chocolat3_milk> can someone tell pat he can break the walls on this map?
[3:27:28] <%Sadira_snack_attack> @PatStaresAt not sure if the price is accurate. It lists the price for both versions of the PS5
[3:27:34] <%gimmickypizza> they clarified it
[3:27:37] <ThatButler> Forgot the add-on but it basically instantly revives but consumes the whole kit
[3:27:40] <%de1ete_forever> D. White man

[3:27:48] <%Starotter70> Dwight looks like my Computer Teacher from High school
[3:27:50] <mark_collins45> Rumor is that the PS5 will be $499
[3:27:50] <j0ustar> @DedlokPM gotcha. here's to hoping that's the disc version and a lower-price digital
[3:27:52] <Dr_Suddenboner> 1200 canadian
[3:28:08] <+Commiekin> there's a rumor that the ps5 will cost 10 bucks and one hamburger
[3:28:09] <+ragingbrachy> was that a bahroo emote
[3:28:10] <dinnydanny777> @dementedpenguin I mean, God Hand is better than a lot of PS4 games
[3:28:13] <+IMCthulhu> rooHappy
[3:28:13] <+ragingbrachy> on that characters shirt
[3:28:13] <FlongBongle> Lmfao @ 1200 for a console

[3:28:22] <j0ustar> microsoft and sony need to stop playing price chicken
[3:28:22] <%Taisuru> lol
[3:28:24] <%Spydurman> my bet is $499 for Digital $549 for Disc

They've subscribed for 17 months! im really love dead by daylight but all the good perks being locked behind dlc is rough, though i do think the shine was a good addition hope both you and peach keep streaming it every now and then cause it's great :D
[3:28:27] <%Dementedpenguin> @dinnydanny777 This is true.
[3:28:32] <%Mendin> Nailed it
[3:28:37] <venomfury86> It will be Free with a copy of Fallout 76
[3:28:41] <%heartlesshealer> aren't there lockers right there?
[3:28:41] <mak0t0yukii> Do you want your Ps5 with ass or no ass, i'm getting mine with ass
[3:28:43] <Dr_Suddenboner> @Spydurman sounds about right

[3:32:51] <%xeros720> i thought paige was the blind brutal killer
[3:32:51] <jemeralddragoon> I need tips as Killer because people are just being shit to me in post game chat for ‚Äútunneling‚Äù
[3:32:52] <@SoFarFetched> ooh I would
[3:32:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> wut
[3:32:55] <%ShawnTK_> yes @FlongBongle

[3:32:58] <danknugglit> Yay
[3:32:59] <%DianaTheAscian> i hate u twitch
[3:33:03] <%DedlokPM> @Binary_Fireball it's a grade
[3:33:04] <%thegreenbenis> Nurse is interesting
[3:33:05] <dinnydanny777> It needs to be said that the PS5 looks like a very impressive space heater
[3:33:05] <%Dementedpenguin> plus you have shards to use if you want extra bloodpoints
[3:33:08] <OperatorPlease> i could never play nurse worth a damn
[3:33:08] <+Commiekin> oh christ no
[3:33:09] <Solidnick18> i haven't seen her
[3:33:09] <%DensityD> infectious
[3:33:11] <ThatButler> Nurse game will either be amazing or incredibly painful
[3:33:13] <%kewlmyc> When does Pyramid Head come out?
[3:33:14] <Animal_Farm4> Pat if you don't 4k with nurse I'm going to be incredibly sad and dissapointed :)
[3:33:15] <%Starotter70> Oh boy
[3:33:16] <FlongBongle> Noooo
[3:33:16] <KingKZ> I am woeful with the Nurse.
[3:33:17] <j0ustar> my bet sticks to $600 digital $700 disc $750 disc + bundle -tax here's to hoping I lose my bet
[3:33:17] <%Binary_Fireball> @DedlokPM ah thanks that makes sense
[3:33:18] <%Taisuru> Pyramid Head should come with a SH Nurse skin for Nurse
[3:33:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yo.....What if the Mask got in D&d
[3:33:23] <%patriotrenegade> What gives you the right, to put a man's life in your hands? You
[3:33:29] <%Frost_Quill> @jemeralddragoon Tunneling means focusing on one to remove them from the game early. They'll say it no matter what.
[3:33:29] <Monkeyweed21> are perks consumables in this game?
[3:33:29] <+Remery_> SH nurses are much hotter
[3:33:34] <Dreigun> @jemeralddragoon I've foundd you'll get accused of tunnelling regardless of actually focusing a specific survivor or not
[3:33:34] <%DedlokPM> @kewlmyc tuesday
[3:33:36] <Stofil42> nurse waiting for her bf to get patched in
[3:33:36] <%Starotter70> @Pookiedaexzile No, Son of the Mask
[3:33:38] <Captain_Doomsday> Gooood luck
[3:33:39] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt Take surveillance with your ruin
[3:33:40] <%Dementedpenguin> @Monkeyweed21 you keep them forever
[3:33:40] <LunarDiscorded> Yeah SH Nurses are too hot lmao
[3:33:43] <dinnydanny777> Why does she not have a stomach
[3:33:44] <Animal_Farm4> You don't use addons with nurse
[3:33:46] <%kewlmyc> @DedlokPM Cool, thanks
[3:33:49] <%patriotrenegade> What gives you the right, to put a man's life in your hands? You're a cold-blooded killer, you must be insaaaaaaaaaaneeeeee STUPID MAN OF HATE
[3:33:51] <Captain_Doomsday> Use the one that lets you see where you'll go.
[3:33:51] <jemeralddragoon> @dreigun that‚Äôs what tunneling is? Ok
[3:33:52] <%PauliusMaximus> nurse them to death
[3:33:54] <+OwlLightningMage> Isn't nurse OP?
[3:33:57] <danknugglit> How different is nurse?
[3:33:57] <Captain_Doomsday> Mandatory training item
[3:34:02] <+Commiekin> You need muscle memory for her blinks. Don't do too many predictive blinks, instead use your first to get in range and your second to get right next to them
[3:34:03] <%Frost_Quill> I'm surprised they haven't released a Silent Hill nurse outfit for the nurse with this update.
[3:34:04] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt i haven't played in a while is nurse still good?
[3:34:04] <%Mendin> @jemeralddragoon Tunneling is bad only inasmuch as over-focusing on one player means everyone else has leeway to do generators freely.
[3:34:05] <%huskarl_zap> PH should get a nurse fuck doll like his first appearance in SH downcoming
[3:34:06] <Captain_Doomsday> Brown
[3:34:06] <Dr_Suddenboner> they should add a SH nurse skin with pyramid head
[3:34:09] <+NitronStreams> Nurse? more like Cursed
[3:34:10] <mark_collins45> I'm waiting for the Nurse to Dab
[3:34:10] <ThorW> Nurse is the best killer in the game, just hard to learn @Diana869
[3:34:15] <+Commiekin> Addons are fine now
[3:34:22] <+coldsama> @monkeyweed21 perks are here forever but you can use add ons on your ability and those are consumables
[3:34:29] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt take the plaid shirt thing, it shows where your tp goes
[3:34:34] <Captain_Doomsday> Yeah, I think Pat has 14 of the one he needs.
[3:34:36] <%DianaTheAscian> @ThorW thx
[3:34:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> SH Nurses are the pupular chicks, this nurse is the booky one who don't go out
[3:34:42] <%Starotter70> Man, the Sun's such an asshole, shining in my face while it's setting
[3:34:42] <%de1ete_forever> the menus are very Witcher 3
[3:34:45] <Monkeyweed21> use the consumables boivin
[3:34:48] <jemeralddragoon> @mendin ok, maybe I should cut down on that
[3:34:49] <ahandsomegentleman> so cool
[3:34:52] <Captain_Doomsday> IT used to be UR!
[3:35:05] <Animal_Farm4> Ultra Rare
[3:35:07] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt it's good for learning nurse. When you get good at her people use double green add ons
[3:35:12] <Captain_Doomsday> Yeah, Ultra-Rare. Pink
[3:35:16] <+Commiekin> Don't stick with plaid flannel forever. It's training wheels for nurse, you gotta get used to blinking without it
[3:35:18] <%DensityD> runeterra soon?
[3:35:18] <%weissguard> wooo
[3:35:19] <%DianaTheAscian> do it more
[3:35:19] <Captain_Doomsday> Aww, that's nice.
[3:35:22] <%Starotter70> It's good times
[3:35:22] <Enyoyable> :)
[3:35:24] <%DEETRz> its a good game to watch
[3:35:26] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[3:35:28] <+demon1103> agreed
[3:35:28] <Solidnick18> it's ok
[3:35:29] <Captain_Doomsday> That's not true but maybe it's better streaming
[3:35:31] <+Remery_> Rub gen, open door, leave
[3:35:31] <dakkster> I love watching this game be played
[3:35:32] <%DensityD> he HATES the survivor game
[3:35:35] <@SoFarFetched> You missed a runeterra stream earlier in the week @DensityD
[3:35:36] <%chambatron> I might download dbd. I got with ps+a while ago
[3:35:37] <dakkster> would never play it myself
[3:35:38] <SainEdge> its cool
[3:35:38] <%Keyd00d> I'm glad I can watch it instead of play it
[3:35:39] <%Taisuru> Is survivor or Killer more popular?>
[3:35:43] <%Mendin> @jemeralddragoon One of the more important things to learn is situational awareness in that sometimes a prolonged chase of one survivor isn't worth it and you should be harassing everyone else. HOWEVER, a hooked survivor means two players are distracted (them and rescuer)
[3:35:45] <%de1ete_forever> irony
[3:35:53] <mark_collins45> They just released a new patch for Friday the 13th. So it's not completely abandoned.
[3:35:53] <ThorW> Survivor is WAY more popular @Taisuru It's easier to do well in
[3:35:53] <ThatButler> Doctor may not be the best killer, but he's the most fun
[3:35:55] <%Frost_Quill> Pat plays killer, Paige plays survivor. Both exclusively.
[3:35:56] <Captain_Doomsday> Survivor is more popular because they have the power role and can co-op.
[3:35:58] <Zerud> @Taisuru on stream survivors
[3:36:02] <%huskarl_zap> lol
[3:36:09] <%BubbaRands> just the one titty?

[3:36:39] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> That game is going to be awesome
[3:36:39] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:36:40] <%Frost_Quill> Do survivors see who they're going against or do they only find out when they see the killer in-game?
[3:36:42] <%Typhaeon> What a revelation
[3:36:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> @logoth_ Pretty sure its Binging with Babish
[3:36:44] <Lee_The_Limey> Polygon LUL
[3:36:44] <%Shadicara> BUT DID YOU KNOW PAT
[3:36:45] <%Piemen99> what really
[3:36:45] <@SoFarFetched> Just play Undertale Kappa they tell you murder is bad
[3:36:45] <%baronblank> wow that sounds awful
[3:36:45] <%Typhaeon> Thank you, Polygon
[3:36:46] <+OwlLightningMage> Why is this so much worse than the first one? LUL
[3:36:46] <%spiritofmojave> MURDER BAD
[3:36:48] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i hate murder
[3:36:49] <ThorW> A game making you sad can be fine (Nier; Automata for example), but TLOU2 CANNOT be even CLOSE to as good as the praise it's getting
[3:36:50] <+eanscrale> noh WAI
[3:36:50] <dinnydanny777> Is the game even out yet
[3:36:51] <WhatzePh> Murder bad, golf good
[3:36:51] <%stagemage> game journos dont know their head from their ass, more news at 10
[3:36:52] <%DianaTheAscian> DID U!?
[3:36:52] <%aClassySkelly> WHAT NO WAY
[3:36:53] <Captain_Doomsday> Survivors don't know the Killer beofre the game starts.
[3:36:54] <%Starotter70> Best Comedy Game of the Year
[3:36:56] <%Mendin> So what I'm hearing is that TLoU2 is trying and failing miserably to be a Yoko Taro game
[3:36:58] <%gimmickypizza> Don't take polygon serious not even once
[3:36:59] <warmnoid> neil druckmann really liked august underground
[3:37:00] <%BubbaRands> BIT DID YOU KNOW?
[3:37:01] <Captain_Doomsday> RIGHT, first 3 times.
[3:37:02] <+pectusumbra> The article was like 'yeah murder is bad, shut up game'
[3:37:11] <Monkeyweed21> Skill Up made comparisons to Game of Thrones season 8
[3:37:15] <%Jeemukun> I am ware murder is bad, many games have done a better job representing that message
[3:37:16] <ahandsomegentleman> I personally never understood how people fetishize nurses when their main job involves emptying bedpans and cleaning poo off people... RN is actually a really gross occupation
[3:37:17] <+Karebuncle> @Mendin fucking perfect , yes
[3:37:17] <Dr_Suddenboner> professional video game critics atpCap
[3:37:21] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Feel bad for kill the AI
[3:37:22] <+Remery_> She looks so tired.. so hot
[3:37:23] <ThatButler> Survivors only see the surviors on the screen, killer sees everyone, plus what items they carry
[3:37:23] <venomfury86> Unless if it's against demons
[3:37:25] <+Commiekin> You get killer tips no matter what, only survivors get tips based on if they've seen that killer or not
[3:37:26] <%gimmickypizza> skill up is a hack
[3:37:27] <%Piemen99> wild
[3:37:28] <%DEETRz> thats some dash
[3:37:32] <Solidnick18> woahhh
[3:37:32] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt as a tip: only blink when you ahve 2 blinks. The first gets you close, the second corrects where you go for the hit
[3:37:35] <GrandmasterBFunk> imagine being so sad you're angry at journalists liking a game
[3:37:37] <%Starotter70> Oh dear
[3:37:38] <%Shadicara> She fast as fuk boi
[3:37:39] <%huskarl_zap> FUK HER RIGHT IN THE PUUSAY
[3:37:40] <Captain_Doomsday> She can't fully charge her second tele and it bugs me
[3:37:42] <KingKZ> She is brutal to learn.
[3:37:46] <%BubbaRands> TELEPORTS
[3:37:52] <zamzoph> nothing personnel
[3:37:53] <Animal_Farm4> She's slower than survivors but can teleport through walls and obstacles and is therefore inherently busted and always will be
[3:37:53] <MarkUriah> @ahandsomegentleman but imagine instead of emptying your bedpan a hot nurse sucks ya dick
[3:37:57] <%alcors_wisdom> nano machines son
[3:37:57] <ThorW> Nurse is the best killer because she ignores pallets and windows
[3:37:58] <+Commiekin> Use your first blink to get around the map
[3:38:01] <dinnydanny777> How can people honestly complain about the last of us 2 when the game isn't even out yet
[3:38:02] <Floofiie> I've just started DBD and playing nurse with only 2 blinks hurts
[3:38:07] <+OwlLightningMage> The game sounds so bad LUL
[3:38:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> When It comes to tLOU2 I'm just happy people stopped calling the girl who did more than 3 push ups trans. Shit set back gamers 20 years
[3:38:10] <danknugglit> Neat
[3:38:11] <Captain_Doomsday> There's an addon that makes her normal speed but unable to pass through walls, right?
[3:38:11] <%Mendin> Her teleport is particularly fun on The Game because you can shift floors
[3:38:14] <+Commiekin> Don't double blink except for attacks, it makes her fatigue worse
[3:38:14] <%DEETRz> sweet jesus thats great
[3:38:22] <ThorW> @Captain_Doomsday Yeah, it sucks
[3:38:24] <%Shadicara> Nothin personnel kid
[3:38:28] <%Mendin> Floofie try to get good with just one blink to get the fundamentals down
[3:38:29] <+xmetalicdemonx> I didnt know you can do that
[3:38:32] <%scrumbotime> Juice The Nurse
[3:38:34] <%gimmickypizza> @dinnydanny777 people are dumb that's why
[3:38:34] <ThatButler> what was it, the nurse is only 90% the speed of survivors, but can only get as fast as 113% during a chase?
[3:38:35] <GrandmasterBFunk> i0.magine being so sad you're angry at journalists liking a game
[3:38:37] <+Commiekin> @Captain_Doomsday Only after landing a blink attack hit. It's a terrible add-on.
[3:38:38] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, she requires practice
[3:38:38] <%BunnyEmperor> through obstacles PogChamp
[3:38:40] <Zerud> why she sounds kinda cute after the shriek?
[3:38:45] <+Remery_> Mostly everyone does
[3:38:45] <%Piemen99> I can see
[3:38:47] <%huskarl_zap> link deleted
[3:38:48] <KingKZ> Most people do.
[3:38:50] <Captain_Doomsday> Nurse would be fun if they didn't stun her like that. Oh, you need a hit to use the upside? Worthless.
[3:38:51] <Floofiie> big brain
[3:38:58] <ThorW> Nurse moves at 90% speed, but because of blinks she ends chases very fast
[3:38:59] <Animal_Farm4> You're not really supposed to be walking around the map with her like..... ever
[3:39:03] <danknugglit> So youre supposed to cut them off?
[3:39:06] <%DensityD> bamboozle harder, handsome man
[3:39:07] <Captain_Doomsday> Nurse is the slowest base speed Killer in the game.
[3:39:07] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Is there a Silent Hill skin for the Nurse now?
[3:39:14] <%heartlesshealer> The chain blink mechanic is neat
[3:39:23] <Floofiie> Cut them off, but since tp range is so big you can warp generator to generator in seconds
[3:39:26] <@SoFarFetched> boy looks like she'd take a lot of practice
[3:39:31] <+jacintafor> undershoot it for jukes
[3:39:32] <dinnydanny777> Is this the Maybe I'll be Tracer character
[3:39:35] <Captain_Doomsday> Right, Nurse can't DROP a charge, so you can just turn back when you hear her start and you're fine.
[3:39:36] <+Commiekin> She absolutely does. But when you do she is unbeatable.
[3:39:37] <Zerud> @Enemy_In_Disguise yes and no, there is the silent hill 1 nurse skin for heather
[3:39:39] <+Remery_> Her blinks hurts my eyes on console so i dont play her
[3:39:41] <Captain_Doomsday> UNLESS she teles into the ground.
[3:39:43] <@SoFarFetched> YEAH YOU SHOW THAT TREE WHO'S BOSS
[3:39:44] <%MajorCrasher> yeah the nurse is good but only if you're s pro. otherwise she's pretty terrible
[3:39:45] <dinnydanny777> Is Pat playing Tracer
[3:39:45] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt if someone is doing jukes towards you like that, don't blink right next to them, blink short let them run into you
[3:39:52] <+Commiekin> @Captain_Doomsday Nurse can look down to shortern her blink
[3:39:54] <%Mendin> Seeing the Nurse makes me miss Friday the 13th, where Jason had bits of Nurse, Huntress, Trapper, and like... Demo/Spirit
[3:39:56] <Stofil42> is she finger-flicking the generator?
[3:39:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> Asking for a SH skin for nurse is literally just asking for a mini skirt
[3:39:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Respect
[3:40:01] <Animal_Farm4> To those of you who think she's difficult because of Pat's demonstration, I ask you to look back at Pat's Huntress gameplay when considering his ability to predict where people are going to move
[3:40:09] <+The_Butterfly_Man> tough killer but the best killer in the game and will always be the best killer in the game
[3:40:10] <Captain_Doomsday> Nurse has Telekinesis.
[3:40:13] <Enemy_In_Disguise> @zerud Weird. Figured it be an obvious choice
[3:40:15] <ThorW> @Stofil42 Yeah, nurse has telepathy, she doesn't carry people either she floats them
[3:40:17] <+Commiekin> No she is 100% the hardest killer to learn, this isn't just Pat
[3:40:19] <ThatButler> It probably means the 1 character is either not with the others, or is baiting you
[3:40:22] <%Piemen99> can you do several shorts hops in a roll before the black out screen?
[3:40:25] <%Taisuru> Is Ash Williams any good? Or how do survivors work?
[3:40:26] <%Mendin> Nurse has the highest skill floor AND ceiling
[3:40:31] <Captain_Doomsday> Survivors are skins.
[3:40:38] <Basilisx> You gotta be really bad as Nurse some games to get really good as her later on
[3:40:41] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Well at least you admit it and that is very strong of you
[3:40:41] <%Mendin> Technically every survivor is the same, they have no inherent like the killers
[3:40:47] <Captain_Doomsday> Ash is the only one with voice lines (out of game) though.
[3:40:48] <ThorW> @Commiekin I dunno, I think huntress might have the highest skill ceiling, but nurse has the highest skill floor
[3:40:48] <%chambatron> AngriestPat would know how to use this character
[3:40:49] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @Taisuru survivors are all the same its just the perks you put on them
[3:40:49] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> she is the best killer and the hardest to learn
[3:40:49] <+Commiekin> @Taisuru Survivors are basically just skins. They all bring in some perks, but none of his are particularly good.
[3:40:53] <london_flexing> blink cancels?
[3:41:00] <Meekest> You also got one of the biggest maps in the game with the slowest killer in the game so
[3:41:02] <inz0mbiac> tagged
[3:41:11] <MarkUriah> @Basilisx but failing once means give up forever
[3:41:13] <%Dementedpenguin> Yeah, Nurse has quite the learning curve. You gotta take several bad losses to truly get her.
[3:41:18] <Captain_Doomsday> Don't waste time breaking pallets with Nurse.
[3:41:20] <+Commiekin> @ThorW Eh. I think Nurse has the higher skill ceiling too, as a Huntress player. It's not totally dissimilar though
[3:41:23] <dinnydanny777> Can you not blink past those
[3:41:28] <Captain_Doomsday> You can
[3:41:29] <%Taisuru> @Commiekin How does getting the other survivors perks on him work?
[3:41:33] <Animal_Farm4> You can teleport halfway across the map every 5 seconds..... the speed doesn't matter
[3:41:33] <dapperskeleton69> nurse has a high skill ceiling
[3:41:34] <+Commiekin> This is absolutely not one of the biggest maps in the game. It got crunched a while back
[3:41:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> Think Bow and Arrow not Sniper Rifle
[3:41:38] <%MajorCrasher> nurse is by far the most frustrating killer to learn. I just can't do it without wanting to smash my monitor
[3:41:39] <Captain_Doomsday> She's SUPER hard to learn, no judgement
[3:41:39] <%LordSDB> Yeah but you got a S tier killer, you'll be fine
[3:41:41] <Zerud> if you pick a map like the jigsaw one can you teleport through all the walls?
[3:41:50] <%heartlesshealer> pallets force animations on people hopping them
[3:41:51] <%Mendin> OH YEAH SHE CAN
[3:41:53] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck I HATE playing Nurse
[3:41:54] <+Commiekin> @Taisuru Whenever you level a character to 30, 35, and 40 respectively their "teachable perks" are unlocked for everyone
[3:41:58] <Basilisx> Truuu lmao its disheartening sometimes, when I started her I only played her on reset. @MarkUriah
[3:41:59] <+meatgeneral69> kill that B
[3:41:59] <Captain_Doomsday> Nurse is S-tier with peak skill. Spirit is S-tier out of the box.
[3:42:02] <%LordSDB> Pat just got to get use to it
[3:42:05] <studleydoorite> nurse pick your head up off the floor smh
[3:42:05] <%AncelDeLambert> the downside of her ability when you miss is SO AGGRESSIVE
[3:42:08] <danknugglit> Nurse go ree
[3:42:10] <+Commiekin> @Zerud Yes, but you can also teleport through the floor.
[3:42:10] <+Skelegroove> Nurse seems like a much more difficult version of spirit
[3:42:12] <ThatButler> So a nurse gets stuned for longer depending on how many blinks she performs and if she attacks after a blink
[3:42:14] <@SoFarFetched> gotta practice
[3:42:15] <SomeOtherNeb> play better
[3:42:15] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Why does the character keep freaking out and looking at the ground?
[3:42:15] <%Mister_McDerp> get good
[3:42:16] <+pkdragoon> nurse is so difficult to get the hang of
[3:42:18] <%spiritofmojave> Do gooder
[3:42:23] <dapperskeleton69> i suck fat dick as nurse so i dont blame anyone else finding her bad
[3:42:24] <%UvBenServed> Get less bad
[3:42:26] <%Pookiedaexzile> Bow and Arrow, not Sniper rifle, Lead the shot
[3:42:26] <%Idziman> alt tab
[3:42:27] <%BubbaRands> GIT GUD
[3:42:28] <%Starotter70> Win
[3:42:30] <Zerud> @Commiekin dear god
[3:42:31] <ThorW> Yeah I wouldn't feel bad about losing with nurse, she's HARD to learn. But the payoff is you win basically every game
[3:42:33] <+Commiekin> OhTofu has a big guide on Nurse they dropped recently.
[3:42:33] <Solidnick18> play your best
[3:42:36] <Captain_Doomsday> Spirit can't go through walls. But there aren't many walls this map.
[3:42:36] <SummonerMagno> dig up
[3:42:37] <Stevie0g> It hurts to teleport
[3:42:37] <%Mendin> @TurtlesAndTentacles Her teleport has a cooldown stun
[3:42:38] <%AncelDeLambert> that's the problem, I can't snipe for shit
[3:42:39] <%Taisuru> @Commiekin Ah, that's a bit annoying. I'm very much of the woolie mentality of "I want to play the character I want to play"
[3:42:40] <theshillman> stop doing games journalism :^)
[3:42:40] <%heartlesshealer> gotta lead the shot
[3:42:42] <%de1ete_forever> get more good?
[3:42:43] <%LymanAl> Kill the survivors
[3:42:43] <+Commiekin> @Zerud Yeah. It's a blessing and a curse.
[3:42:44] <Captain_Doomsday> Pat got a bad hand for trying Nurse.
[3:42:45] <%boomstickery> hmm
[3:42:53] <%chambatron> She honestly does not seem fun at all.m Like playing with a handicap
[3:42:54] <j0ustar> do better
[3:42:57] <%Mister_McDerp> journalist gameplay LUL
[3:43:00] <spacecatstreams> it pat
[3:43:03] <+Commiekin> @Taisuru You don't have to play a character to level them up, just spend bloodpoints on them
[3:43:04] <%de1ete_forever> get more better
[3:43:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Mendin AH okay, thank you!
[3:43:05] <@SoFarFetched> I can see that
[3:43:06] <+Remery_> Same, had to derank back to bottom ranks just to learn her because red ranks survivors are unforgiving
[3:43:07] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt She makes a lot of sounds like the Witches of Hemwick and the Mad Ones they summon in Bloodborne. The noise the Nurse makes when she lunges forward sounds like the sound the Witch make when they cast a fireball and the screech sounds like the noise Mad Ones make when they attack
[3:43:11] <Animal_Farm4> Everybody hates this character
[3:43:14] <Stofil42> polygon reviewer-tier gameplay right here
[3:43:14] <%heartlesshealer> journalist gameplay would be not using the blink at all
[3:43:14] <%Taisuru> @Commiekin Ahh, cool!
[3:43:15] <%logoth_> Just do it perfectly
[3:43:17] <%DensityD> get more bing bong boy
[3:43:18] <+The_Butterfly_Man> chase don't worry about breaking a gen unless its almost done
[3:43:19] <%Mendin> Eli hates a thing? SHOCKER
[3:43:20] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> !uptime
[3:43:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 43m.
[3:43:21] <wyvernlord15> what is happening when the character looms down and the screen shakes?
[3:43:22] <ThatButler> High level nurse play is incredible to watch tho.
[3:43:23] <%AncelDeLambert> I'd prefer if they just nerfed her blink and got rid of the slow period at the end of it
[3:43:25] <%spiritofmojave> TRY FASTER üò°
[3:43:28] <Captain_Doomsday> @chambatron Nurse is fun to WATCH high skill level play of. Too miserible to learn and I hate her self-stun.
[3:43:28] <ThorW> @chambatron Her movespeed is a handicap, but the blinks more than make up for it. Someoen without experience on her will alwways make her look bad
[3:43:33] <+Commiekin> @chambatron When you're really good she is basically a steamroller
[3:43:34] <%BunnyEmperor> does she walk like the nurses from silent hill
[3:43:36] <%heartlesshealer> plefer
[3:43:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> Have you tried not paying more attention to the cutscenes than the tutorial
[3:43:38] <+jacintafor> you should probably teleport more
[3:43:39] <+Wizardism> Become more Gooder
[3:43:42] <%Mendin> @wyvernlord15 Post-teleport she gets slightly stunned, for balance
[3:43:51] <Srthunda> She doesnt walk at all, she floats
[3:43:57] <%BubbaRands> is it weird that I kinda wanna see a DBD fighting game with all the killers in it? Based on their tech alone it would be insane PogChamp
[3:44:01] <%Mister_McDerp> SPEED
[3:44:02] <%DensityD> give up 4Head
[3:44:03] <jemeralddragoon> Any tips on playing Huntress?
[3:44:04] <Lee_The_Limey> LUL
[3:44:05] <Captain_Doomsday> That's it. That's my whole issue with the character. Being stunned feels awful; don't make it part of someone's kit.
[3:44:10] <CurrySauseBandit> LUL
[3:44:12] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @PatStaresAt use one blink for travel so you don't get stunned as much
[3:44:12] <CurrySauseBandit> You saw him
[3:44:13] <ThatButler> he was right there!
[3:44:14] <j0ustar> Will Pat kill his victims? Find out in: "Pat, Defeated!"
[3:44:14] <%thegreenbenis> @jemeralddragoon Throw your axe
[3:44:15] <AtomicXIII> Theyre gonna farm you for points LUL
[3:44:16] <MarkUriah> blind man
[3:44:21] <+Remery_> Yea such a hard penalty for missing
[3:44:22] <%chambatron> Thanks guys. i might pick up the game and play it later but i'll defo stay away form her at least for a while
[3:44:23] <ThorW> PAt needs to use his first blink more for travelling across the map
[3:44:23] <Zerud> @jemeralddragoon 360 no scope them
[3:44:24] <Captain_Doomsday> Yeah, you're stunned less for 1 blink than 2.
[3:44:31] <jemeralddragoon> @thegreenbenis fair enough
[3:44:32] <%SovPho> @Captain_Doomsday Don't play Overwatch
[3:44:32] <+beardy_foxbear> Free game for the survivors i guess
[3:44:37] <spacecatstreams> bap
[3:44:38] <@SoFarFetched> ah I heard a mic
[3:44:42] <dapperskeleton69> bap
[3:44:46] <Captain_Doomsday> @SovPho Too late, but I did quit for a reason.
[3:44:46] <%BunnyEmperor> I see so she is a Blackmage in FFXIV
[3:44:50] <+Commiekin> @chambatron If you want a good killer to start with, LF is easy to pick up and has the best perk (but is weak) or Wraith are both good choices
[3:44:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> "I wanna use the Torque Bow....Yeah man I know how to use it"
[3:44:58] <goroke> First time im watching this game and it had to be Pat playing the a super hard killer lol
[3:45:02] <+Remery_> the cheeks are just breaking
[3:45:02] <%DensityD> my blood if falling apart
[3:45:03] <dapperskeleton69> nurse is the most frustrating character to play
[3:45:07] <%Mendin> @jemeralddragoon Dont get too horny for hachets, save them to punish windows, pallets, and long straightaways. They slow you during windup so try to do short-charge ones and aim slightly higher to compensate for the arc
[3:45:11] <@SoFarFetched> That's some Top Shelf thinking there Pat Kappa
[3:45:11] <%chambatron> THanks commie I'll be sure to do that
[3:45:14] <%Keyd00d> Get some shelves in her butt
[3:45:15] <%thegreenbenis> @jemeralddragoon Get good at the axe throw it's amazing.
[3:45:15] <%logoth_> Do you have to use the blink twice?
[3:45:16] <%BubbaRands> NOT AGAIN NotLikeThis
[3:45:16] <%DianaTheAscian> is Paige still broken?
[3:45:18] <+Remery_> the blur
[3:45:19] <%Starotter70> Does Paige need a shelf to store her butthole?
[3:45:26] <%de1ete_forever> go to IKEA, what an adventure
[3:45:29] <%Spydurman> Paige need a shelf to hold up her butt?
[3:45:35] <%Taisuru> This character seems painful
[3:45:38] <%Mendin> Paige is never NOT broken
[3:45:38] <rarejackalope> this character seems like they suck
[3:45:38] <ThorW> Pat panics too much out of the blink, he's super not used to it LUL
[3:45:40] <ThatButler> Yeah, she definitely baiting
[3:45:43] <Monkeyweed21> play more Dishonored to practice the blink
[3:45:50] <Estel013> IKEA has some amazing shelves and shelving units
[3:45:51] <+Rewrench> afaik part of her gameplay is also to feign teleport so survicors dont know when she actually does it
[3:45:53] <jemeralddragoon> @thegreenbenis I keep ending up in maps where there is no room to throw the axe and survivors constantly turn corners or run behind shit as I throw
[3:45:53] <+thatonemiller> sorry just got to stream, is pyramid head out and will he be plaid on stream?
[3:45:54] <@SoFarFetched> A shelf for Paige to put her ass and boobs on for when she is exhausted f or the day
[3:45:59] <%Mendin> @Taisuru She is the definition of High Execution High Reward for this game
[3:46:00] <Lee_The_Limey> They playin you so hard
[3:46:02] <KingKZ> This is why I just cut my losses and play as the Spirit.
[3:46:06] <j0ustar> You really like that boat huh Pat
[3:46:14] <Captain_Doomsday> The worst part is Survivors are REALLY smug when they beat a Nurse.
[3:46:15] <@SoFarFetched> Get back on the Boat Pat
[3:46:15] <+Commiekin> @rarejackalope She is comically punishing and takes a lot of time to learn. Go watch OhTofu or Umbra or ArdethaBite play her to see her played right.
[3:46:18] <dapperskeleton69> THE BOAT
[3:46:25] <ThorW> She is
[3:46:26] <ThatButler> She Is
[3:46:27] <+jacintafor> she is
[3:46:27] <Stofil42> who's the fastest killer?
[3:46:30] <yeetdabsenpai69> she is
[3:46:31] <%Spydurman> she is
[3:46:34] <+Commiekin> She is, Pat. She's 97% move speed
[3:46:35] <dapperskeleton69> she is
[3:46:35] <ThatButler> hill billy is fastest
[3:46:36] <%Mendin> Legion fastest?
[3:46:37] <MarkUriah> the entity is gonna be so pissed
[3:46:40] <rarejackalope> oh i see ok thanks
[3:46:41] <jacksawjack> That Killer seems like megashit biscuits
[3:46:43] <dinnydanny777> Just ambush people
[3:46:43] <+thatonemiller> sorry just got to stream, is pyramid head out and will he be played* on stream?
[3:46:45] <%thegreenbenis> @jemeralddragoon Practice practice practice, it's hard
[3:46:45] <%MajorCrasher> I play the spirit exclusively as m1 only because red rank survivors never fall for her power
[3:46:46] <Zerud> ding
[3:46:47] <%de1ete_forever> boatmster Xtreme
[3:46:47] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt Nurse moves at 90% speed to help balance her ability to teleport past stuff
[3:46:48] <Captain_Doomsday> Billy. BTW, speed from perks adds to chainsaw sprint
[3:46:51] <dapperskeleton69> the nurse is about to get fired
[3:46:51] <@SoFarFetched> Tuesday for Pyramid Head
[3:46:53] <+zepelinnn1> those spasms LUL
[3:46:57] <+thatonemiller> ahok
[3:46:58] <+thatonemiller> thanks
[3:47:00] <inz0mbiac> ehhhh, i HATE it
[3:47:05] <Captain_Doomsday> Nurse is 90%!? I thought she was like 101%
[3:47:10] <ThorW> Nope
[3:47:11] <@SoFarFetched> Quit Nursing them Pat
[3:47:11] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> This killer looks bad if you don't know what the fuck you're doing.
[3:47:12] <%DedlokPM> she is one of the slower killers because of her teleport
[3:47:13] <%Ranryu692> it seems like Nurse is a bad killer AND you're bad with her
[3:47:14] <ThorW> Nurse is the slowest kliller by far
[3:47:17] <dinnydanny777> Play like you're going to jumpscare people
[3:47:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> or are you the worst pat stares at ever?
[3:47:22] <%Taisuru> NOPE
[3:47:24] <%de1ete_forever> wups
[3:47:28] <%Nickmobox> THIS IS WHY NURSES ARE PAID LESS THAN DOCTORS
[3:47:32] <ThatButler> Nurse is 101% when she's on a chase and is fully maxed out on speed
[3:47:33] <Monkeyweed21> Angriest Pat would have got her
[3:47:33] <%DedlokPM> @Ranryu692 She was one of the best until they nerfed her into the fround.
[3:47:37] <Lee_The_Limey> Even a broken clock a right twice a day Kappa
[3:47:41] <AtomicXIII> The entity will ban you from the Nurse LUL
[3:47:42] <Captain_Doomsday> I do not like that Nurse, my man. I do not like her, Sam I Am.
[3:47:42] <Estel013> AngriestPat would be able to play the nurse :P
[3:47:42] <%Bearphonics> I haven't played this in a while but it seems like they really nerfed the nurse
[3:47:44] <+Commiekin> She is not 101%. She is 96.25
[3:47:47] <%Taisuru> @Nickmobox That's just awful LUL
[3:47:50] <+Commiekin> She still gets blood lust like normal killers
[3:47:55] <%Nickmobox> LUL LUL
[3:47:57] <%Mister_McDerp> she looks so sad
[3:47:58] <@SoFarFetched> wow she even LOOKS dissappointed at her play
[3:47:58] <j0ustar> "What a nice killer, letting us win"
[3:48:00] <dapperskeleton69> ENTITY DISPLEASED
[3:48:00] <Quantus> Sad nurse :(
[3:48:01] <%Mendin> Hey Pat can we get a Hag game so you can show chat how to properly jumpscare people with wizened women?
[3:48:01] <dinnydanny777> She looks disappointed
[3:48:02] <Captain_Doomsday> That was maybe her worst map, too.
[3:48:03] <SomeOtherNeb> she even floats shamefully
[3:48:05] <%chambatron> She doesn't even have tittys :(
[3:48:06] <%Starotter70> BibleThump
[3:48:06] <%kyh9> Which killer's kit do you think has the most 'flavor'?
[3:48:07] <Animal_Farm4> OMEGALUL
[3:48:08] <%Nickmobox> She's so sad
[3:48:08] <%Mister_McDerp> FeelsBadMan
[3:48:10] <inz0mbiac> satan is ashamed
[3:48:11] <%BubbaRands> no nurse for you
[3:48:12] <+Commiekin> No, her worst map would be Lery's
[3:48:12] <wyvernlord15> can the killer hide in any way?
[3:48:14] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt Don't feel bad, Nurse is the hardest killer to not suck at
[3:48:18] <Captain_Doomsday> Ghostface probably has the most nuance.
[3:48:20] <danknugglit> She looks so sad she didnt kill
[3:48:20] <%Taisuru> The Virgin Nurse vs The Chad Hag
[3:48:24] <jacksawjack> Let's not use that worthless bastich again
[3:48:31] <Animal_Farm4> Michael Myers can hide in Tier 1
[3:48:33] <%Keyd00d> Pat does well with hag
[3:48:35] <Captain_Doomsday> Hag is like Nurse + Trapper
[3:48:35] <Lee_The_Limey> LUL
[3:48:35] <%snow_bush> Ghostface Killa for DbD when?
[3:48:36] <%boomstickery> ged outta my shwamp you kids
[3:48:37] <ThorW> I probably lost 80% of my games when learning nurse
[3:48:39] <%MajorCrasher> ghost face feels mega easy to me in comparison to nurse
[3:48:44] <Animal_Farm4> there's a build called jump scare Myers that's terrible on like 90% of maps
[3:48:46] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:48:47] <%Mendin> Yeah Pat used to be a hag semi-main so this should be strong
[3:48:49] <+Commiekin> Yeah, ghostface is fun but he's not that nuanced.

[3:50:28] <%Frost_Quill> Wait that does Hag even do, I've been assuming she was the plague lady.
[3:50:30] <%de1ete_forever> I might hit the weed, I might hit the boof
[3:50:37] <Animal_Farm4> Legacy prestige Meg
[3:50:37] <%maenos2> nice boat
[3:50:38] <Animal_Farm4> lookit that
[3:50:41] <+Remery_> No pudding for you
[3:50:44] <legacy0117> Pat gonna play as Grandma Swamp this time. x3
[3:50:55] <%redrins> ok yea thats a good ass
[3:50:56] <+Commiekin> @Frost_Quill She lays down traps on the ground, up to 10. If survivors run over them a ghost version of her jumps up and screams at them. She can then teleport and take it's place within X seconds
[3:51:00] <jacksawjack> Time for Grandma Wendigo
[3:51:00] <@SoFarFetched> Spenpai
[3:51:04] <%DianaTheAscian> welp
[3:51:04] <wyvernlord15> I havent seen this game in years. from what i remembered the killer was way powerful. that might just be that the game was new and people were bad. this looks like a nightmare for the killer
[3:51:07] <%crimsonharvest> ham
[3:51:09] <Meekest> That seems like a SWF
[3:51:12] <%Keyd00d> And then you'll play the game
[3:51:12] <%Mendin> Pat did you prestige Hag at some point where did all her stuff go
[3:51:12] <%Ranryu692> did they use an ember on themselves?
[3:51:13] <Captain_Doomsday> FLASHLIGHT ALERT! You have entered a zone of high toxicity!
[3:51:14] <%Frost_Quill> @Commiekin That sounds amazing.
[3:51:14] <Animal_Farm4> Since they're named that, It's very possible they got it during that time period where you could basically cheat it in
[3:51:14] <%spiritofmojave> Dwight is gonna mop you monkaS
[3:51:23] <Captain_Doomsday> IGNORE those fucks
[3:51:25] <Enemy_In_Disguise> They should put Mr. X in this
[3:51:29] <%ryome> I wonder if they know each other.
[3:51:34] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt Remember you can place traps indefinitely. Only 8 can be up, it'll just erase your oldest one for the 9'th +
[3:51:40] <KaiserMario> !uptime
[3:51:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 51m.
[3:51:46] <ThatButler> Flashlights, get ready for all those hex traps to be burned away.
[3:51:47] <%Frost_Quill> I only play Pig, Ghostface, and Huntress so seeing all of these is nice.
[3:51:50] <+Commiekin> @Frost_Quill She's pretty good, yeah. You can pop down traps in the middle of a loop to completely deny it. SpaceCoconut's a good Hag main if you wanna watch one.
[3:51:55] <%Mendin> Oni on release had the Mr X level THOMP THOMP THOMP footfalls
[3:52:00] <%PauliusMaximus> is hag jyst trapper but good?
[3:52:02] <%Starotter70> Oh hey, 13 Sentinels is coming to the west
[3:52:04] <legacy0117> Mr. X would literally walk through walls, and the Pallets.
[3:52:19] <ThorW> Oni on release was kinda crazy he could like 180 hit with his attacks
[3:52:23] <legacy0117> Kinda hard to avoid that.
[3:52:26] <Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt how long do you think it'll take before Destiny cuts Forsaken and the game becomes officially ruined
[3:52:27] <%MajorCrasher> the trapper is actually really good, he just has a slow setup
[3:52:30] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, getting new killers sucks shit
[3:52:34] <%Frost_Quill> @Commiekin Thanks, might check it out.
[3:52:39] <jacksawjack> Remember, when all else fails, duct tape chainsaws on everything.
[3:52:46] <+Commiekin> Oni didn't release with the 180s, that was only on the PTB I think. Which was totally fucking nuts.
[3:52:47] <ThorW> The new player grind in DBD is pretty brutal too. It's a lot of time investment
[3:52:49] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't wanna buy survivors I'll never use with my real money, and earning the ingame currency to buy a killer takes a lifetime
[3:52:59] <Lee_The_Limey> Pat got setups Kappa
[3:53:00] <%chambatron> How much would you end up paying for all dlc chars on ps4?
[3:53:10] <+pixelmike> as a newer player, the harder thing is learning how the hell to get good lol
[3:53:13] <%MajorCrasher> I just place all his traps on vaults and pallets and the fall for it every time
[3:53:17] <AtomicXIII> Put them by windows and pallets
[3:53:21] <%Starotter70> Whenever Paige sits up, does the sound of broken glass explode from her back?
[3:53:25] <%Jeemukun> any thoughts on streaming demon's souls cause of the remake?
[3:53:32] <%Ranryu692> more liked Hagged
[3:53:33] <armchairmaster_> Oh no...not this killer NotLikeThis
[3:53:37] <%Ranryu692> *like
[3:53:45] <%Ranryu692> already there
[3:53:46] <graemecrackers2> Nice
[3:53:49] <%AncelDeLambert> how many traps can she have down at one time?
[3:53:51] <SomeOtherNeb> that was GOOD though
[3:53:55] <+abrupt_abe> LUL
[3:54:01] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @PatStaresAt Landed the job, so I'm starting a career come July!
[3:54:02] <+IMCthulhu> i think pat's hag enough puns LUL
[3:54:07] <+Commiekin> @MajorCrasher Don't just put them on the vaults and pallets, actually. Look for pathways and shit too. And bring one around so you can threaten to shut off a loop when you need to
[3:54:07] <legacy0117> Unfortunately Pat is teleporting as much as Grandma Swamp normally does.
[3:54:09] <+michingmallecho> I bought demon souls because of the remake. I‚Äôm excited to play it since I never tried it before
[3:54:11] <SomeOtherNeb> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille Well done!
[3:54:14] <legacy0117> not*
[3:54:22] <dinnydanny777> That's the same survivor
[3:54:26] <%Starotter70> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille Congrats
[3:54:41] <@SoFarFetched> Hag giving the survivors the bad touch
[3:54:52] <+pixelmike> lol
[3:54:54] <%AncelDeLambert> HAHAHAHA
[3:54:55] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Thanks!
[3:54:56] <%AncelDeLambert> dumbass
[3:54:56] <%boomstickery> lol wtf
[3:54:59] <+IMCthulhu> clap dem cheeks, pat!
[3:55:01] <+pixelmike> bill
[3:55:04] <Solidnick18> alright
[3:55:04] <Lee_The_Limey> Stronk Hag
[3:55:06] <+michingmallecho> Get EM pat
[3:55:12] <%AncelDeLambert> did he seriously try to pallet stun you then vault behind you?
[3:55:14] <Captain_Doomsday> You know, I try not to be horny on main, but I follow Paige and she keeps liking super hot ladies.
[3:55:18] <%Mendin> Big SWF clowning
[3:55:18] <%MajorCrasher> @commiekin see anytime I put one out in the open on a pathway they just see it and disarm it. they fall for loop spots because they're running and not paying attention
[3:55:28] <@SoFarFetched> THem loops brother
[3:55:33] <%Mendin> paige does occasionally dabble in The Gay, yes
[3:55:46] <%hypermike88> Make them bleed Pat.
[3:55:57] <+thatonemiller> pat u got this
[3:55:59] <%AncelDeLambert> that was a Paige juke, right there
[3:56:03] <Lee_The_Limey> They gettin shook
[3:56:05] <+Commiekin> @MajorCrasher Not just out in the open, but like in the grass between trees or at the tops of stairs. You also gotta watch for people watching you place down your traps.
[3:56:09] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige, are you playing against Pat right now!!
[3:56:11] <SomeOtherNeb> I'm all for Paige liking super hot ladies because I also happen to enjoy super hot ladies
[3:56:13] <%boomstickery> hes dumb or trying to feed
[3:56:16] <AtomicXIII> LUL
[3:56:16] <+jacintafor> why are they dirty
[3:56:18] <@SoFarFetched> BLINDED BY THE LIIIGHT
[3:56:20] <Captain_Doomsday> That was some edgelord tech
[3:56:22] <%Taisuru> Flasher
[3:56:33] <+thatonemiller> are girls watching
[3:56:43] <+Remery_> looks like someone through hot chocolate in your face
[3:56:43] <Captain_Doomsday> So Hag is the shortest Killer and has a smaller Terror Radius.
[3:56:43] <%AncelDeLambert> better hit that gen
[3:56:45] <%boomstickery> pat you missed her
[3:56:48] <$Afterman_> slap slap slap
[3:56:53] <Lee_The_Limey> No girls are watching Kappa
[3:56:55] <groovykrovvy> oh shidd, pats playing Grandma Swamp! LuvSign LuvSign LuvSign LuvSign
[3:56:56] <%Mendin> Lightborne (reduced flashlight stun) becomes more important as you go up in ranks for obvious reasons
[3:57:00] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:57:01] <@SoFarFetched> can't believe paige is being horny on main
[3:57:02] <%ChaosAethr> Well GG Pat
[3:57:03] <Captain_Doomsday> DON'T PICK-
[3:57:06] <Solidnick18> LUL
[3:57:09] <Captain_Doomsday> Oh wow no DS.
[3:57:13] <Lee_The_Limey> sausage fest chat
[3:57:18] <+Commiekin> @Captain_Doomsday Nah, Myers has a smaller terror radius unless in T3
[3:57:39] <Captain_Doomsday> Myers has the smallEST in the game at T1, but I think the same as Hag's at T2
[3:57:40] <scarletdye> So much for Legacy 3 Dwight
[3:57:43] <%JumboCrunchies> I just got back, how's it been going? Is Pat doing the big murders?
[3:57:48] <%de1ete_forever> splish splash hooks in the back
[3:57:50] <%Mendin> Got generator clowned on but you're getting your hits in at the end at least
[3:57:52] <$Afterman_> pat is doing the medium murdewr
[3:57:55] <%ChaosAethr> Got 2 at least
[3:58:02] <krazy_mike> her knees looked dirty
[3:58:07] <groovykrovvy> i cant believe i missed pat playing Grandma Swamp
[3:58:09] <+Commiekin> @Captain_Doomsday Nope. Hag has 24. T2 myers has 16
[3:58:21] <$Afterman_> I see Pat is playing the Paige character
[3:58:24] <%AncelDeLambert> oh wow she got off
[3:58:28] <%AncelDeLambert> aaaand she's dumb
[3:58:33] <%AncelDeLambert> 4% and you WASTE it!!
[3:58:41] <Captain_Doomsday> Wow, Myers is a bit better than I realized.
[3:58:45] <+The_Butterfly_Man> wasn't 4% had a perk
[3:58:46] <+Commiekin> That wasn't a 4%. They're broken, they used Deliverance for that 100$
[3:58:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Traps seem busted
[3:58:51] <%AncelDeLambert> big ol' camper Pat
[3:58:59] <Captain_Doomsday> HAg traps don't trigger if they crouch.
[3:59:06] <Captain_Doomsday> And are destroyed by flashlights
[3:59:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Ah
[3:59:08] <%MajorCrasher> I love the hag's traps
[3:59:13] <$Afterman_> do some oni rushing
[3:59:17] <%MajorCrasher> gen rush ruins it though
[3:59:17] <groovykrovvy> people run into hag traps like dummies, i love it
[3:59:19] <+thatonemiller> thatonemiller subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:59:20] <+Commiekin> @Captain_Doomsday Yeah. Pair him with M&A or his Dead Rabbit addon and you get suuuuper fucking close to survivors. Unless it's a corn map then your dumb ass white mask is always visible
[3:59:26] <FlongBongle> Myers
[3:59:33] <%CursedNobleman> whats that smell? ITS BLOOD
[3:59:41] <armchairmaster_> The problem with the hag isnt the traps; it's that FUCKING ANNOYING PERK that's like "FUCK YOU if you want to repair generators"
[3:59:44] <%ChaosAethr> BOO
[3:59:45] <SomeOtherNeb> ??
[3:59:45] <Captain_Doomsday> @Commiekin That damned corn field.
[3:59:46] <Lee_The_Limey> I thought you was the trap master pat, you'll never get to nationals like this
[3:59:48] <%thatonemiller> second sub on twitch ever wanna support
[3:59:50] <%boomstickery> honey no
[3:59:51] <%Starotter70> Paige
[3:59:52] <groovykrovvy> boo hiss
[3:59:58] <ThorW> I like deathslinger, he's fun. It's like extreme fishing
[3:59:59] <+Commiekin> @armchairmaster_ They nerfed Ruin months ago.
[4:00:01] <wyvernlord15> is the killer actually faster? like even just 2%?
[4:00:04] <groovykrovvy> love the dumb pun, tho
[4:00:05] <legacy0117> She triessss.
[4:00:09] <AtomicXIII> This guy seems like a better Huntress?
[4:00:10] <Captain_Doomsday> "Fishing...TO THE DEATH!"
[4:00:20] <Meekest> BUG SNAX
[4:00:21] <Lee_The_Limey> Pat's on his phone retweeting 2B ass for us
[4:00:21] <%Mendin> Killer is usually like 110% or 115% of a survivor's movespeed yeah
[4:00:22] <+MorphinePandaa> worse huntress
[4:00:23] <groovykrovvy> paige with the dad puns LUL
[4:00:28] <ThorW> @AtomicXIII Nah, huntress is better
[4:00:31] <armchairmaster_> @commiekin good.
[4:00:33] <+Commiekin> @wyvernlord15 Depends on the killer. Generally, they're either 110% or 115% faster. Only nurse is slower than survivors by default.
[4:00:38] <AtomicXIII> Ah ok, not played in a long time
[4:00:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker would kick every killers ass
[4:00:56] <Captain_Doomsday> In this game or in general?
[4:01:01] <%CursedNobleman> terminator killer would be gas
[4:01:02] <%Taisuru> Pat, where did you land with Remnant From the Ashes?
[4:01:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> YES
[4:01:06] <+Commiekin> @wyvernlord15 Uh, to be clear +10% faster or +15% faster
[4:01:06] <ThorW> He's decent, but not op
[4:01:06] <Snookasaurus> no
[4:01:09] <Meekest> VERY good
[4:01:15] <+Commiekin> Decent but not great.
[4:01:15] <+chocolat3_milk> he's got a built in mori
[4:01:16] <extradopeness> Pat will you stream BugSnax?
[4:01:22] <Meekest> That's the best part about him
[4:01:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> AMAZING, but low skill cap
[4:01:27] <ThorW> That ability has a BIG windup and is easy to dodge if you don't force survivors into a bad spot
[4:01:30] <+IMCthulhu> he has a built in alternative hook and mori
[4:01:32] <SomeOtherNeb> @Taisuru I'll shill for that game anytime, it's so goddamn good
[4:01:34] <%NovaKnightmare> Revenant Ocelot...
[4:01:34] <+Estuko> Is he still caked up on a teusday morning??
[4:01:36] <SomeOtherNeb> except the bosses
[4:01:36] <+Commiekin> Also thorny jail is not as useful as people think because you're basically just saying "Hey some one immediately rob me of pressure"
[4:01:38] <+IMCthulhu> and you can hook at a range with him
[4:01:38] <ZeeJiggle> His lack of map control is what hurts him most.
[4:01:45] <wyvernlord15> I get it. thanks. are there any killers with long range abilities?
[4:01:49] <+Commiekin> It does not.
[4:01:51] <Anidem1714> BugSnax!
[4:01:52] <ThorW> It's doesn't
[4:01:53] <%MajorCrasher> they stay in torment after they get in it
[4:01:54] <+Commiekin> No hook perks apply to special jail
[4:02:00] <ThorW> No hook abilities count with it, killer or survivor
[4:02:09] <DuoScratch> Cage does not proc ANY hook effects, for both killer or survivor.
[4:02:09] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Xenomorph when?
[4:02:10] <%Taisuru> @SomeOtherNeb I love the flavor of it for sure, and it LOOKED good, I just thought I remembered pat having some issues with it long term
[4:02:13] <+Commiekin> It's better than slugging
[4:02:14] <Captain_Doomsday> Oh, being able to deny Survivor hook skills though
[4:02:18] <+AXL808> it really shouldn't
[4:02:20] <dinnydanny777> They should add Ness from Undertale
[4:02:22] <$Quiet__Viking> it's quick
[4:02:24] <ZeeJiggle> Saves time carrying to a hook yourself.
[4:02:25] <Meekest> Fast
[4:02:26] <extradopeness> TALKIN BOUT BUGSNAX
[4:02:26] <%MajorCrasher> not having to take time to go to a hook
[4:02:27] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt You avoid things like decisive strike, borrowed time, etc. And it's fast
[4:02:28] <+MorphinePandaa> survivors blocking hooks
[4:02:30] <+Commiekin> Slugging is super important and PH can do one better
[4:02:32] <+The_Butterfly_Man> they arn't spawned across the map abd I guess BBQ
[4:02:34] <%bevyrage> saves time and denies all hook skills
[4:02:34] <dinnydanny777> BUGSNAX YEAH
[4:02:38] <Meekest> Can't use perks against you
[4:02:40] <Captain_Doomsday> Immune to Sabotage, which nobody uses anymore
[4:02:46] <$Afterman_> Its good if there are several people around you, because it places them FAR away. So if have 1 down by 3, torment him and others take a bit to get to him
[4:02:50] <groovykrovvy> Torment you can hook, then not worry about DS later
[4:02:53] <+Commiekin> You basically only wanna use it when you would otherwise be leaving a survivor on the ground
[4:02:55] <ThatButler> ignoring borrowed time is super storng!
[4:02:57] <Captain_Doomsday> It denies flashlights and pallet saves
[4:02:59] <CurrySauseBandit> For your rank. It is LUL
[4:02:59] <SomeOtherNeb> @Taisuru I don't remember his stream tbh, but while the game has some issues (it looks very bland to me), it has some amazing feeling gunplay and a shitton of replayability
[4:03:00] <%hypermike88> psaElmo
[4:03:00] <MissFantasy> how about we not talk about bugsnax and how horrific it is
[4:03:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> Like me
[4:03:03] <%thelonechris> Lovecraftian Food Nightmare game
[4:03:07] <$Quiet__Viking> just don't do a build that relies on hooks
[4:03:11] <dinnydanny777> Bugsnax's song is a banger
[4:03:12] <+neojadan> It's a good alternative to slugging, but that's about it.
[4:03:16] <ZeeJiggle> I mean they might end up changing it too so they count like regular hooks.
[4:03:19] <%Starotter70> Yeeehaw
[4:03:19] <%MajorCrasher> oh yeah, it fucks borrowed time
[4:03:28] <extradopeness> BugSnax is gonna rule
[4:03:32] <Captain_Doomsday> WAIT. Yeah, BBQ doesn't stack with PH
[4:03:38] <inz0mbiac> RIGHT into you
[4:03:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> Brap Pigs
[4:03:42] <Captain_Doomsday> EVERY GAME!
[4:03:53] <dinnydanny777> Bugsnax looks like the ultimate stealth horror game, as in it looks like a normal game but it's actually horror
[4:03:55] <+Commiekin> @ZeeJiggle Probably not, it's part of the trade off. It's fine as is, a nice utility to be deployed when necessary not always.
[4:03:55] <ThorW> You can still hook normally with PH, just his special hooks are a counter to hook skills
[4:04:02] <Captain_Doomsday> Did they rework spawns?
[4:04:09] <SomeOtherNeb> Bugsnax is definitely a horror game
[4:04:18] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yeah, he's a black guy again @Captain_Doomsday
[4:04:22] <Sotetsu> Pat is in hard focus mode.
[4:04:26] <+Estuko> I've been noticing those big red scratches all over, what's the deal?
[4:04:36] <+MorphinePandaa> PH has alot more in his kit than the average killer though
[4:04:42] <%Starotter70> psaBlind
[4:04:44] <Sotetsu> Turn a light on.
[4:04:44] <Captain_Doomsday> SPAWN WAS WHITE!?
[4:04:45] <+OwlLightningMage> it's bright though
[4:04:46] <%haitakaa> that was a woolie tier shot
[4:04:51] <Finaldragoon> literally blind
[4:04:52] <%Frost_Quill> @Estuko Trail for the killer to follow. Otherwise killer couldn't win.
[4:04:52] <+OwlLightningMage> Are you Paige now?
[4:04:54] <ThorW> @Estuko Survivors leave those behind when they run so the killer can tracck them. It's to discourage running everywhere
[4:04:56] <yeetdabsenpai69> @estuko that's where the survivors ran past
[4:04:57] <dinnydanny777> I wonder what gimmick Pyramid Head will have
[4:04:58] <+Commiekin> @Estuko Whenever a survivor runs, they leave behind those big red scratch marks. They fade over time.
[4:04:58] <%GarbageNirvana> red scratches are survivor tracks basically
[4:05:01] <%MajorCrasher> @estuko survivors leave marks when they run. it helps killers find them
[4:05:06] <dinnydanny777> What's Pyramid Head's gimmick
[4:05:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Pas has become Paige, a blinder of worlds
[4:05:19] <rufus2k2> Spawn had the ability to turn human, but the drawback was he couldn't turn into Al Simmons, instead he turned into a white guy
[4:05:21] <%Mendin> pyramid head has Repuuken
[4:05:23] <%CursedNobleman> noooo. stop runniiiiing
[4:05:23] <+Estuko> @Frost_Quill @ThorW @yeetdabsenpai69 @Commiekin @MajorCrasher thanks lol everyone with those machine gun fingers
[4:05:31] <ThatButler> But you have a gun, you should win pallette interactions
[4:05:34] <dinnydanny777> Why are you running?
[4:05:35] <extradopeness> Lets get BugSnax monster in DbD
[4:05:40] <rufus2k2> it was a way of Malbolgia messing with him so he couldn't meet Wanda
[4:05:40] <erknen> is that a harpoon gun?
[4:05:44] <+Commiekin> It's a harpoon gun
[4:05:47] <%Frost_Quill> @dinnydanny777 Long range attack that can hit through pallets, and can instantly hook them and sent them across the map super fast.
[4:05:55] <%Mendin> Ezekiel Rage with a Harpoon Gun
[4:06:01] <ThorW> @dinnydanny777 He can shoot a DMC drive shot, he can put survivors on special silent hill hooks, he can instant kill survivors if certain conditions are met, and he has a THICC ass
[4:06:13] <%AncelDeLambert> I see they still haven't done anything to these levels to make it so that the Trapper can even function
[4:06:18] <%MajorCrasher> gun actually only beats pallets if you got them before they throw it down or you can go around it before they break the chain
[4:06:21] <+OwlLightningMage> IT'S NOT DARK PAIGE
[4:06:23] <AlphaTauri> perfectly calibrated
[4:06:25] <+Estuko> @ThorW his ass is so strong.
[4:06:26] <%AncelDeLambert> clumps of weeds, devs, that's all I ask for
[4:06:34] <Monkeyweed21> PERFECTLY CALIBRATED
[4:06:34] <+Commiekin> Up your monitor brightness? This map shouldn't be that dark
[4:06:36] <yeetdabsenpai69> ITS NOT DARK PAIGE
[4:06:38] <rufus2k2> @Mendin Real Adventures of Johny Quest, been awhile
[4:06:40] <$Afterman_> Use the nvidia control panel open to cheat and lighten it
[4:06:41] <+The_Butterfly_Man> no imagine that with a offering that makes it darker
[4:06:41] <+Kise77> Sounds like someone needs to calibrate their monitor Kappa
[4:06:44] <%Starotter70> This stream has never been more Blind
[4:06:46] <Finaldragoon> 1 and 2
[4:06:46] <rhysbrando> imagine playing on ps4 eabSMILE

[4:12:35] <%king_wragles> 2?
[4:12:36] <%AncelDeLambert> like one more
[4:12:37] <%Ranryu692> can you not turn your brightness up?
[4:12:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat needs special eyes
[4:12:40] <dan_g_v> pretty dark
[4:12:42] <%king_wragles> 3
[4:12:43] <yeetdabsenpai69> EYE DOCTOR
[4:12:45] <OperatorPlease> he can't turn it up MID GAME
[4:12:45] <%Taisuru> Is this pat's favortie character?
[4:12:47] <Lee_The_Limey> Come hang with us
[4:12:49] <Captain_Doomsday> Okay well...IDK, I'm glad Pat likes Deathslinger, but he seems mediocre to me.
[4:12:49] <warmnoid> nyaagh
[4:12:50] <KasiCrafter> It's SUPER dark.
[4:12:50] <$Afterman_> @Kenzo2000 hospital aint that bad
[4:12:50] <%AncelDeLambert> I was hoping Pat would miss her
[4:12:51] <%AncelDeLambert> THE GEN
[4:12:52] <%Frost_Quill> @Ranryu692 He can't pause until the match is over.
[4:12:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's like the light sources doesn't actually emit any light onto the map
[4:12:54] <%Mendin> @Captain_Doomsday A full chain hook till snap will send a survivor from Healthy to Injured but not kill em, and put a "Heal or get hurt" timer on them
[4:12:54] <+xmetalicdemonx> It is dark
[4:12:56] <AlphaTauri> oh come ON
[4:12:58] <%Ranryu692> ah
[4:12:59] <Darknaturexd> their team work sucks kill them pat
[4:12:59] <%DedlokPM> @AncelDeLambert because The Game is one of the shittiest maps in te game. Probably only better than Hawkins Lab from Stranger Things
[4:13:00] <%kewlmyc> adjust brightness on TV?
[4:13:04] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @Kenzo2000 the hospital aint too bad anymore
[4:13:05] <%MajorCrasher> if I could remove all indoor maps from the game, I would in a heartbeat
[4:13:08] <+Estuko> RESCUE
[4:13:10] <%AncelDeLambert> ????

[4:13:23] <kulmoth> teched that throw
[4:13:24] <%DedlokPM> This is an in-game brightness issue.
[4:13:25] <%spiritofmojave> Teamwork in this game for once LUL
[4:13:27] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking PATCH THAT
[4:13:28] <+OwlLightningMage> It's dark but I can still see things. I think Pat's tv is fuck
[4:13:31] <ThatButler> This is why I play Doctor, why search for survivors when you can just have them tell you where they are?
[4:13:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> that fuckin SUCKS
[4:13:34] <ThorW> That will never be patched
[4:13:35] <+AXL808> true teammates
[4:13:37] <+Commiekin> That's part of his power
[4:13:37] <%thelonechris> Using the jank

[4:13:42] <Lee_The_Limey> Back you go

[4:13:51] <%DianaTheAscian> that was to smart for randoms
[4:13:52] <%SquigglyLizard> LUL
[4:13:52] <Captain_Doomsday> I think it's a shade or two of game brightness and one of Pat's TV
[4:13:56] <%juxtest> stob
[4:13:56] <%spiritofmojave> yeeee
[4:14:01] <%SovPho> you just passed him
[4:14:02] <yeetdabsenpai69> I dont remember this being so bad
[4:14:04] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @Kenzo2000 yea did a whole revamp it even looks better
[4:14:05] <%FaderPotater> dang they are getting disrespectful lol
[4:14:06] <%Starotter70> What a high level play
[4:14:07] <ThorW> @Diana869 Nah, he's at red ranks now so he'll get good players once in a while
[4:14:23] <Frostydough1> look at them just crawling on the floor in front of you they KNOW this place is dark as shit
[4:14:29] <%DEETRz> this is really hard to see
[4:14:30] <Captain_Doomsday> Isn't Pat still green?
[4:14:34] <+yin_x3> this game is really hard to look at
[4:14:40] <Lee_The_Limey> LUL
[4:14:52] <comedeity> way too hard to see
[4:15:01] <%Taisuru> Is this character part of the base game or a DLC?
[4:15:04] <ThorW> @Captain_Doomsday yeah, but that's high for killers so most matches he'll be agaisnt 4 red ranks
[4:15:04] <Captain_Doomsday> DLC
[4:15:14] <%Mendin> My funniest asshole survivor story is once I was chasing an injured one who , right before being caught, finished sabotaging the only hook in the area. I looked around a second, set them down, and popped the Mori I happened to have on
[4:15:15] <%DedlokPM> @Taisuru dlc
[4:15:17] <$Kenzo2000> @Taisuru DLC
[4:15:18] <+Commiekin> @Captain_Doomsday I came back from a 4 month break into baby ranks. First match was a green, a purple, and two reds. Match making sucks and rank is meaningless
[4:15:18] <Captain_Doomsday> BUT, Deathslinger is an OC, so he's possible to grind. 9000 shards is a ton though
[4:15:20] <ThorW> @Captain_Doomsday Not a lot of people play killer in this game, or at least not for long
[4:15:20] <SomeOtherNeb> this game has like $100 of DLC, it's super offputting
[4:15:32] <inz0mbiac> she got greedy
[4:15:36] <Captain_Doomsday> Well, can't argue with any of those replies.
[4:15:37] <jemeralddragoon> You don‚Äôt need the dlc
[4:15:43] <Captain_Doomsday> There's a reason I've quit DbD twice
[4:15:47] <dan_g_v> always have faith you can get there in time to ruin their day
[4:15:49] <%Spydurman> I couldn't even see her
[4:15:50] <+Commiekin> Actually 5 month break? Whenever Oni got nerfed.
[4:15:51] <SomeOtherNeb> people keep saying the cool perks/characters are locked behind DLC though
[4:15:53] <+badjab326> hooker pat
[4:15:54] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck navigating this place
[4:15:55] <%Mendin> For a 20 dollar game yeah it has almost f2p levels of
[4:15:56] <$Kenzo2000> @SomeOtherNeb yeah, but you don't have to get any of it, or you can cherrypick the ones you want. It's not that bad in practive
[4:16:02] <DavidSanChan> if you bugsnax'd her would you grow one boob
[4:16:06] <CosmosDeity> Is this game tedious to play when they keep escaping after you've hooked them? Like isn't there a way to kill them outright?
[4:16:06] <%thegreenbenis> There they are
[4:16:07] <Captain_Doomsday> I refuse to spend money on DbD. I resent it deeply, but forced myself to play because it was a gift.
[4:16:09] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> this map fucking sucks so much
[4:16:10] <%SovPho> @SomeOtherNeb That's just how it goes when you hit it big, honestly. If you release a game that's mega popular and you get sponsorship requests from all over the place then you're probably gonna do some shady shit.
[4:16:12] <%MajorCrasher> thanks are mostly meaningless because it's a ladder that's impossible to go down until reset
[4:16:12] <+Estuko> NotLikeThis my weakness is getting lost in games or maze type levels, I start to fall asleep fast
[4:16:15] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @Captain_Doomsday you left but everyone comes back some day
[4:16:16] <ThorW> @Captain_Doomsday It's super terrible right now. I've seen people rank 15 facing 4 red ranks
[4:16:35] <%MajorCrasher> ranks*
[4:16:38] <Captain_Doomsday> @CosmosDeity A rare offering lets you kill people you've hooked before, but only the rarest lets you kill everyone. There are also perks for it.
[4:16:40] <SomeOtherNeb> @SovPho I can't blame them for selling out because they clearly do good work but as a potential customer it's an instant "no thanks"
[4:16:41] <ThatButler> She's on controller
[4:16:44] <%Frost_Quill> @CosmosDeity 3 hooks will kill, and there are special circumstances that let you kill them early.
[4:16:49] <%freakfullmetal2> freakfullmetal2 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[4:16:53] <%bevyrage> @CosmosDeity there's a couple of killers with a means to kill someone outright, like hillbilly and chainsaw. also once a survivor gets hooked three times they're dead iirc
[4:17:02] <%SovPho> @SomeOtherNeb Same. I'm also just not that into competitive stuff these days anyways.
[4:17:07] <$Afterman_> myers t3 can also instadown survivors on hit
[4:17:10] <Captain_Doomsday> @The_Butterfly_Man That's because the competition is cursed! White Noise 2 is a better game, you've never heard of it.
[4:17:10] <%Mendin> Billy/Chainsawman DOWN them outright, not "Kill" them
[4:17:24] <+Commiekin> @Afterman_ Only with the tombstone piece or the tombstone itself. And the tombstone proper suuuuucks
[4:17:24] <CosmosDeity> @Frost_Quill Ahh I wasn't aware of that. Thanks.
[4:17:30] <+OwlLightningMage> BAN EVERBODY WITH BLIND EMOTES LUL
[4:17:32] <Captain_Doomsday> Resident Evil Resistance, bundled with 3r for no reason, dying.
[4:17:34] <%bevyrage> last DBD stream pat did he just killed a person with a chainsaw
[4:17:35] <%SovPho> I remember when I spent 60 bucks to get Faceless Rex in Dota 2 and that's as bad as I got and will ever get.
[4:17:40] <+not_draven> whens next ds3 stream?
[4:17:40] <Captain_Doomsday> F13, Copyright killed it.
[4:17:43] <ThorW> The only ways to kill a survivor are with an item offering, leaving a survivor on a hook long enough, or hooking them 3 times
[4:17:47] <$Afterman_> @Commiekin no? Just get terror 3 and 1 hit downs, doesnt kill but downs
[4:17:48] <$Kenzo2000> There are instant kill mechanics, but they usually don't activate until late in a match
[4:17:49] <%bevyrage> it's a 1 use kill for a map and survivors know when you use it
[4:17:54] <inz0mbiac> man, she flipped
[4:17:55] <%bevyrage> unless i'm thinking of texas chainsaw dude
[4:17:57] <Darknaturexd> mice
[4:18:01] <Captain_Doomsday> Last Year, people hate it on principle because they launched on Discord a year ago.
[4:18:02] <%Starotter70> They had to get their friend BibleThump
[4:18:03] <+Commiekin> @Afterman_ Downing isn't killing, they were asking about kills.
[4:18:12] <%Mendin> That was a looney tunes flip when you whacked her
[4:18:22] <+chocolat3_milk> campy
[4:18:24] <%GarbageNirvana> she screams like an opera singer
[4:18:26] <$Afterman_> @Commiekin I know. I was just saying that myers can bypass the 2 hit to down, makes killing easier
[4:18:33] <Captain_Doomsday> Let me just say that I resent DbD enough that I'll readily offer a list of alternatives to anyone interested, including a free mobile clone.
[4:18:33] <%MajorCrasher> I feel like killers are even weaker in last year than in dbd
[4:18:36] <+Commiekin> Yeah, fair.
[4:18:36] <%AncelDeLambert> they're not gonna save her when you're in terror radius, Pat
[4:18:48] <ThatButler> ooh, and so close to the basement
[4:18:50] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @SomeOtherNeb you can get perks from dlc if they pop up in the shrine of secrets and any dlc that ain't a license you can unlock the killer or survivor through just playing
[4:18:51] <%Mendin> Bear in mind that downing doesnt count as hooking for the "3 and they're dead"
[4:18:54] <Lee_The_Limey> Abandoned
[4:18:58] <weirdducks> alright pat we get it you can afford paid actors can you play a regular game now
[4:19:00] <ThorW> @MajorCrasher I'd agree. You can get literally murdered like crazy in that game
[4:19:11] <%spiritofmojave> ban me Pat psaBlind
[4:19:16] <Captain_Doomsday> @MajorCrasher I haven't played Last Year since it looks like it's dying, but I THINK the lean is that pipe bombs just stomp killers. Seems salvagable, though.
[4:19:21] <+Estuko> SHE WANTS A FIGHT
[4:19:22] <%gimmickypizza> have you came around on potential game of the decade bugsnaxs yet?
[4:19:31] <%DedlokPM> @bevyrage there are special offering items that are called Moris that let you kill downed survivors under special conditions, You get overall less points for killing them that way though.
[4:19:31] <%spiritofmojave> real talk this map is dark
[4:19:32] <%Starotter70> NO ONE LEFT BEHIND
[4:19:43] <%MajorCrasher> I like DBD, I just wish it was balanced better and had a ranking system that made sense
[4:19:58] <%bevyrage> ah fair
[4:20:01] <AlphaTauri> nice
[4:20:02] <Lee_The_Limey> LUL
[4:20:10] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpRtsd
[4:20:15] <+Commiekin> There's too mmuch luck involved to ever be a really good rank system
[4:20:27] <Captain_Doomsday> Yeah, DbD had me ANGRILY addicted for so long because it has potential.
[4:20:35] <+dawsfloss> aeyviThinking
[4:20:44] <Monkeyweed21> 6969 lol
[4:20:47] <agustorm123> are you gonna play the last of us 2 pat?
[4:20:47] <$Afterman_> and tomorrow you'll be rank 13
[4:20:49] <Captain_Doomsday> It CAN be great. It insists on smugly bearing its many little flaws and has no competition to motivate it though.
[4:20:49] <$Afterman_> not too bad

[4:20:53] <%AncelDeLambert> watching Pat play... yeah there's no fucking way I'm going back to this game. I can REMEMBER the anger at being looped and how unfun it gets
