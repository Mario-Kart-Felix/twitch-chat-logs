[0:09:34] <Oxybe> Beaststars = anime AND Beaststars = furry AND Pat = anime THUS Pat = Furry Barge

[0:14:35] <namisrot> i bounced off this game SUPER hard but i rally wanted to like it
[0:14:37] <filialpails> grant kirkhope recorded "come and have a go if you think you're hard enough" and then mixed up the syllables to make "eekum bokum"
[0:14:37] <+Andrizzleton> Eekum Bokum
[0:14:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's usually the day after a day of bad sleep. The body takes two days for every one day of bad sleep.
[0:14:40] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt but isn't Paige going to hate this because...you know?
[0:14:41] <%happyface699> Animal crossing?
[0:14:42] <heartlesshealer> Paige, you better stay here for this one. It's awesome if Pat doesn't suck too hard to distract from lore
[0:14:43] <personaplatinum> If Paige likes skeletons and being a furry. Why doesn’t she like animal skeletons?

[0:16:21] <missingangle> You fucking asshole LUL but i get it
[0:16:21] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Woolie is cursed
[0:16:22] <%DappercatEsquire> I used to have the same reaction when people would recommend bands
[0:16:23] <hot_take_jake> Yeah I had that happen to me with the beatles
[0:16:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat hates other people feeling joy.
[0:16:24] <Profmcstevie> You.....you showed Woolie
[0:16:24] <ape_hawk> OH GOD I CAME WHEN I PLAYED IT
[0:16:26] <%SaiyanShoto> Hipster then?

[0:16:30] <Prevot> how do you out-hipster WOOLIE
[0:16:31] <namisrot> that was me with undertale for so long
[0:16:35] <%Deano8817> Man I hate persona 5 royal I hope pat doesn't play it :)

[0:16:38] <%TheWinged7> yes
[0:16:39] <namisrot> now i am literally wearing undertale pajamas
[0:16:40] <%topendbuzza> no
[0:16:40] <+oda_flobunaga> Transistor is Bastion 2: Electric Bugaloo
[0:16:46] <Vashido22> Other people's joy go up, Pat's interest go down basically? @PatStaresAt
[0:16:47] <usurper_sos> no
[0:16:53] <ape_hawk> you sure showed woolie
[0:16:57] <+Walopoh> LUL his brain is failing
[0:16:57] <namisrot> elmo is licking his butt
[0:17:02] <%walternatorz> pat's memory defaults to "shit on woolie"
[0:17:03] <%logoth_> Transistor is Woolie's CrossCode
[0:17:06] <Ipsenscastle> specifically Woolie
[0:17:07] <%CJett92> Transistor is like 4-5 hours long, you could totally beat it in 1 sitting
[0:17:10] <+Andrizzleton> You Shodan transistor
[0:17:14] <ape_hawk> when someone gets a boner, pat gets flaccid
[0:17:15] <hot_take_jake> Jerking off to how good the thing is off-putting
[0:17:15] <Profmcstevie> You sure got him with that not playing a cool game
[0:17:16] <heartlesshealer> The Wire
[0:17:16] <SirKeigan> When people are too over the top about it
[0:17:17] <tabbymcgee> i get that tbh
[0:17:17] <Vashido22> ohhh I get it
[0:17:22] <%bhp_99> That was me with Stardew Valley
[0:17:25] <Vashido22> yeah yeah I totally get it
[0:17:25] <Prevot> like how you talk about FFXIV?
[0:17:26] <hot_take_jake> Like how people are with the Beatles
[0:17:26] <PanicSwytch> I agree
[0:17:26] <%ShogunNoonto> With that logic people shouldn't play 3rd strike
[0:17:28] <%TheWinged7> the overly glowing reccomendation, the kind i give due to brain issues
[0:17:30] <heartlesshealer> When Woolie told you about The Wire
[0:17:30] <%Valdorick> Pat, let me TELL you about this game that is BETTER THAN SEX
[0:17:30] <1BeatGames> I feel like your brain is still melting from yesterday
[0:17:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> This thing cured my cancer and made me regular

[0:17:38] <%SaiyanShoto> Isn't that how you described FF14?
[0:17:38] <tabbymcgee> im guilty of doing that tho
[0:17:39] <+oda_flobunaga> Disco Elysium for example
[0:17:39] <%king_wragles> She's right hto
[0:17:40] <%CzeekyPlays> But was it wrong every time???

[0:18:35] <Oxybe> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN SWORD ART ONLINE ALICIALIZATION
[0:18:36] <dakkster> I have that problem when talking about the endless series games

[0:18:43] <SirKeigan> @PatStaresAt That was you and Demon's Souls
[0:18:44] <%nimu290> its how you act towards banjo
[0:18:44] <BoneofMalkav> Chrono Trigger
[0:18:44] <1BeatGames> It's a good game, but not the greatest
[0:18:44] <schneidernoah6> EEKUM BOKUM
[0:18:44] <%logoth_> FFT
[0:18:45] <+Walopoh> Undertale INVENTED the RPG pacifist genre Pat Kappa
[0:18:46] <%Deano8817> there was that golden period where you could get into undertale before talk about it flooded the entire internet
[0:18:47] <%CJett92> I mean, its p good tho, ya?

[0:18:53] <tabbymcgee> DmC
[0:18:54] <%Jaxnos> these are our standards.
[0:18:54] <+Andrizzleton> i can no longer tell if paige is saying eekum bokum or if I'm hallucinating it
[0:18:54] <%Solid_Stro> Death Note is SOoOoo Good!!! doodThirst
[0:18:54] <critfumble_> NEW VEGAS?
[0:18:55] <PopulousNix> Undertale was good, especially for its genre, but yeah goddamn the fandom

[0:18:57] <Vashido22> EEKUM BOKUM
[0:18:57] <Dragon_Batman> 3rd strike a god dam good game

[0:19:22] <hot_take_jake> E-cum Bow-Qüm
[0:19:24] <%bhp_99> I love that part
[0:19:25] <olaksi> Undertale was soured a bit by everyone else jumping on the saccharine bandwagon
[0:19:25] <%Valdorick> Yeah, its called killing ONLY Papruyus

[0:42:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Valdorick He was so good in Bastion SuperGiant was like "Hey want to have a role in literally every game we ever release now?"
[0:42:58] <codycurry52> The ost in this game is up there with fucking Nier for me.
[0:43:04] <SaltyAzteca> Fuck this game on hard though, its PAIN.
[0:43:05] <steff_mcbee> legitimately one of the best game OSTs ever

[0:43:23] <+Skelegroove> bark

[0:44:46] <farrellcityking> Tell Gief he’s not as cool as Elmo and accept it
[0:44:50] <tabbymcgee> i remember you could do crazy ass combos in this game

[0:46:10] <heartlesshealer> fight in progress
[0:46:11] <%hax_metatron> More math / programming references you love to see it
[0:46:19] <BoneBagMel> No, first time playing

[0:46:31] <BoneBagMel> so avoid spoilers; pat's first transistor
[0:46:37] <%Andrizzleton> honestly bastion's combat is better imo
[0:46:39] <anAngryHamster> Pat, are you looking forward to Red being in Indivisible?
[0:46:40] <dukenux> ah yes, time to collect souls
[0:46:44] <T_Sasquatch> Oh i thought pat already beat the game . Damn
[0:46:44] <%superc37> @michingmallecho spoiler alert: theres music
[0:46:47] <snakemuho> what's also insane is all the models in this game are 2D sprites rendered from a lot of angles instead of straight 3D models
[0:46:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is that her.... SOUL?
[0:46:52] <heartlesshealer> Paige's first Transistor too
[0:46:53] <dukenux> I really wasn't sold on Bastion's combat
[0:46:54] <AwkwardPon> time for the best offensive skill in the game

[0:47:26] <hot_take_jake> oh hey this was my text alert for a little bit
[0:47:39] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I never liked Transistor's mix of real-time/turn-based combat. I'd rather have it fully one way or the other.
[0:47:48] <%ScoIIym> ScoIIym subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey pat been awhile since I've been able to watch and I'm glad to be back! Anyway would recommend replaying Alan wake/ playing AW American nightmare before the the control dlc?
[0:47:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> This world is already wild, I love it.
[0:47:56] <dukenux> wow, it's just like irl with polls
[0:48:11] <hot_take_jake> this would be a sick character action game
[0:48:22] <%topendbuzza> F
[0:48:26] <heartlesshealer> her
[0:48:38] <SailingSaturn> @hot_take_jake mine too, still creates a Pavlovian response LUL
[0:48:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ScoIIym Not Pat, but you can play Foundation DLC, but you will be completely lost if you play AWE DLC before playing Alan Wake.
[0:48:40] <%hax_metatron> Okay Transistor and its OST are already GOATed. Getting big underrated vibes coming from how chat is talking about it. This is like some all time best shit right here.

[0:48:56] <steff_mcbee> @tallguywithahoodie that's fair, but I like it because it sort of reminds me of dominos - you set up your wicked combos in the frozen time, then unleash it and watch everyone eat shit instantaneously

[0:50:31] <AwkwardPon> always opt to spark when you're not in turn or recovering from turn
[0:50:35] <stormhawk9891> Then switch it to A
[0:50:39] <BoneBagMel> music is perfect
[0:50:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's okay
[0:50:40] <%Valdorick> Young Lady = Paige'd, end 'em all, Red.
[0:50:40] <Jugg4n4ut> I need to go back and finish this game. its so damn good
[0:50:41] <GodGoshDarnIt> a little
[0:50:41] <%Deadpal> music is fine
[0:50:42] <%coreyyotto> sure is
[0:50:42] <%topendbuzza> It's fine
[0:50:42] <%codycurry52> The term "underrated" is horribly misused
[0:50:43] <SaltyAzteca> ITS NOT HIGH ENOUGH Kappa
[0:50:43] <+Javaa01> No, the music is fine
[0:50:44] <%Deadpal> also you can rebind it to A
[0:50:44] <%Deano8817> pump that music up baby
[0:50:45] <seaechiowai> it's fine
[0:50:45] <%TheWinged7> it could be a little higher
[0:50:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> it's low yes.
[0:50:47] <heartlesshealer> music kinda low, but not sure if intended
[0:50:47] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @LiquidDinosaur Transistor wouldn't have happened if Sybil wasn't so thirsty for Red
[0:50:47] <+oda_flobunaga> Get that turnt Up Pls
[0:50:48] <Saltmeisterr> all sound is bit low
[0:50:48] <not_twitter_rowan> a little
[0:50:48] <Vashido22> its fine
[0:50:48] <%Nitsorinni> its k
[0:50:49] <Ipsenscastle> I still remember the initial reveal trailer with its goofy run cycle
[0:50:49] <Daxalog> Music changes volume
[0:50:49] <dukenux> no? i thinik it supposed to be like tha
[0:50:49] <+Toblo1> Musics fine
[0:50:50] <%Spydurman> a bit
[0:50:50] <%Andrizzleton> no it's fine
[0:50:52] <%Jaller101514> its fine
[0:50:53] <%Tearonex> It's fine
[0:50:54] <heartlesshealer> PAIGE LEARN LORE
[0:50:54] <PanicSwytch> its good
[0:50:54] <%Jaxnos> it's always too low if we can still hear you over it Kappa
[0:50:55] <critfumble_> it could be a lil higher maybe
[0:50:56] <rafaelba93> its fine
[0:50:57] <StencilOST> more musak
[0:50:57] <filialpails> PUMP IT
[0:50:57] <%Andrizzleton> this is how it's meant to be
[0:50:58] <reonome> its fine
[0:50:59] <Dragon_Batman> Only a bit
[0:51:00] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a bit low for those who aren't tethered to fucking HEADPHONES
[0:51:02] <DianaTheAscian> its fine
[0:51:03] <not_twitter_rowan> @TallGuyWithAHoodie TRUE LUL
[0:51:04] <+LandOfTheWay> sounds fine to me; it's supposed to be a little lower here, i think
[0:51:11] <Sayie> louder is better :P
[0:51:14] <sileo_patronus> Dash is A in Hades so you brain may be using that
[0:51:14] <%strakillias> Its fine
[0:51:17] <%Valdorick> PUZZLES
[0:51:20] <rafaelba93> its not suposed to ve loyd
[0:51:22] <tabbymcgee> supergiant did sell usbs designed like that

[0:51:25] <lol_red_ranger> delicious phallic USB key dude

[0:51:41] <%Tearonex> there's dash
[0:51:41] <%topendbuzza> mr. speed
[0:51:44] <AMUSERNAME> BEST SKILL PogChamp
[0:51:47] <Daxalog> Best dude in the game
[0:51:48] <steff_mcbee> I mean the game did get awards, but it also doesn't have much of a legacy tbh, you don't see it often talked about past its day but I think it deserves legacy. I'd argue that's a kind of "being underrated"
[0:51:50] <+Toblo1> ZOOM
[0:51:51] <namelez1> best skill
[0:51:53] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Gotta go back when you have time stop powers
[0:51:55] <+Toblo1> Good ol Jaunt.
[0:51:56] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> never take Jaunt off
[0:52:00] <Ipsenscastle> You're racking up codex entries btw if I remember
[0:52:01] <%Valdorick> What an amazing power YOU WILL NEVER REMOVE EVER
[0:52:02] <heartlesshealer> oh hey
[0:52:03] <%Bluwizard21> ugh im so far behind on pat and paige streams
[0:52:04] <Saltmeisterr> jaunt is good but mask tho
[0:52:05] <BioApple> and you can reassign that to A if you want to satisfy the goblins
[0:52:07] <+lethallylactic> monkaS
[0:52:08] <%koolaid_kevster> this looks like bastion
[0:52:10] <%Jaller101514> can you map it to A?
[0:52:10] <%Bluwizard21> Just checking in to say high before bed
[0:52:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @steff_mcbee so like Sekiro?
[0:52:11] <heartlesshealer> this version of this song
[0:52:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nothing personnel, kid
[0:52:15] <Vashido22> NEVER remove it
[0:52:18] <dukenux> Can you read description's on these powers, please
[0:52:19] <%Bluwizard21> got a lot of vods to catch up on
[0:52:22] <%hax_metatron> Jaunt is basically ZA WARUDO
[0:52:25] <Saltmeisterr> mask with breach is so good
[0:52:29] <Daxalog> If you hold the button you can aim the move
[0:52:30] <%codycurry52> Mixing and matching skills in this game is super neat
[0:52:34] <ChungusQuest> Looks like one of Megabyte's goons from Reboot
[0:52:44] <heartlesshealer> Pat no care for lore
[0:52:51] <%topendbuzza> you can dash on cooldown pat
[0:52:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> hack and slash
[0:52:53] <Vashido22> oh yeah, the description on the powers are REALLY important if you want to understand the story
[0:52:55] <Vashido22> its one of those
[0:52:55] <%Andrizzleton> should be using mines more
[0:52:57] <dukenux> OVERKILL Kreygasm
[0:52:59] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> taking bets on whether Pat will play this with no limiters like a *coward*
[0:53:08] <Saltmeisterr> mask tho
[0:53:11] <%AzureGale> I hope pat does a super overkill on Turn() at least once
[0:53:22] <namelez1> both are realy good
[0:53:22] <dukenux> @PatStaresAt read description on these functions
[0:53:26] <scrublord009> I really should get back to pyre
[0:53:26] <snakemuho> they're not mutually exclusive
[0:53:35] <%superc37> MASK
[0:53:38] <T_Sasquatch> I really liked how they incentived using multi power combos to learn more lore
[0:53:44] <%superc37> mask is better
[0:53:46] <thestonedweeb_> northern lion has more viewers then you and Woolie together how does if feel to be beaten by an egg?
[0:53:52] <%JaydenSai> @PatStaresAt You can hold the skills to aim them in Planning mode, just FYI
[0:53:53] <Dragon_Batman> Some had better passives than actives I thought
[0:53:55] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt try mask with breach
[0:54:04] <dukenux> mask is a good passive iirc
[0:54:07] <tabbymcgee> those animations are really nice
[0:54:08] <Saltmeisterr> wait no crash
[0:54:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait your save game? So it took you TWO hours to get here?
[0:54:12] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> and now Pat's brain will melt
[0:54:16] <%Garthunox> @thestonedweeb_ what's the point in that message dude?
[0:54:16] <Ipsenscastle> The Mem system is so cool
[0:54:16] <%Reaped_Psyche> Pat has a thing for chains, canon.
[0:54:22] <heartlesshealer> Which skill gets your backstab
[0:54:22] <%codycurry52> I put it on run
[0:54:22] <+Toblo1> Time For Modular Upgrades!
[0:54:27] <%CJett92> The upgrade system is so freaking versatile, I love it
[0:54:30] <AMUSERNAME> This system is crazy high in permutations
[0:54:32] <Saltmeisterr> mask with crash is super good
[0:54:36] <AwkwardPon> okay now just add jaunt as a sub to spark and BAM you are now playing optimally and correct
[0:54:42] <T_Sasquatch> Math!
[0:54:46] <+Toblo1> The variants you can make into your abilities are *WILD*
[0:54:55] <%superc37> @patstaresat dont forget to read the lore
[0:54:56] <snakemuho> this is A LOT
[0:54:57] <%Jaxnos> look, Pat's playing League of Legends.
[0:54:57] <%SirGO0SE> "what happens if i" is this whole game
[0:54:57] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Jaunt(Mask) is great for cowarding out
[0:55:00] <Vashido22> it goes pretty deep
[0:55:01] <%AzureGale> This might be my favorite loadout system
[0:55:02] <SailingSaturn> Such good combos
[0:55:04] <heartlesshealer> It's very much a lot. Good luck!
[0:55:05] <+Toblo1> Juant as an augment is basically "Do You Want To Use This While On Cooldown"
[0:55:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> which one gives you SUPERUSER?
[0:55:07] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Chat tell him Wombos
[0:55:13] <dukenux> yeah i love the ability system
[0:55:13] <T_Sasquatch> Cleave x 99
[0:55:15] <%topendbuzza> I think I can see why pat dropped this now
[0:55:16] <%hax_metatron> Be a programmer PogChamp
[0:55:17] <Dragon_Batman> Even more as the game goes too
[0:55:24] <TheMorilo> My OCD fucked this game for me. There are too many things to factor in
[0:55:28] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt dont forget skill descriptions for the sweet lore
[0:55:31] <%superc37> rip the lore
[0:55:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> This system gave me choice paralysis lol
[0:55:37] <dukenux> I practically experimented with different combos for the ENTIRETY of this game
[0:55:41] <+whoguru5> Lore? rooVV
[0:55:42] <ulcaban> Aggressive dash
[0:55:44] <heartlesshealer> wrong menu
[0:55:44] <dukenux> yeyeye
[0:55:45] <snakemuho> I think lore might show up later
[0:55:47] <%Valdorick> Haven't unlocked it yet
[0:55:52] <Ipsenscastle> You can, it's in your menu
[0:55:52] <+Toblo1> I don't think its unlocked yet?
[0:55:53] <Vashido22> I think its later
[0:55:54] <superbla25> not yet
[0:55:54] <DjFrostBite95> rooSpy
[0:55:56] <reonome> later
[0:55:56] <%topendbuzza> not yet
[0:55:56] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Yeah! Jaunt(Mask) for the ultimate coward tech!
[0:55:57] <dukenux> Details no?
[0:55:57] <Saltmeisterr> it shows up later
[0:55:57] <critfumble_> relax chat thats a little later
[0:55:57] <Dragon_Batman> The more you use skills the more lore
[0:55:57] <namelez1> i dont think it lets you inspect yet
[0:55:59] <%iamnolionheart> Using each skill as an active, passive, and self passive unlocks lore
[0:55:59] <not_twitter_rowan> @PatStaresAt Use function in each slot to unlock lore
[0:56:01] <dukenux> eh maybe later
[0:56:01] <RiverBirch> That comes up later, I wanna say
[0:56:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> TO get all the lore you need to complete a combat with every program in every possible place
[0:56:07] <Ipsenscastle> oh maybe I'm misremembering?
[0:56:13] <%byuniart> Does the dash invis work well?
[0:56:13] <reonome> chat dumb
[0:56:16] <heartlesshealer> check menu that is not the upgrade menu
[0:56:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> 0.3s of stealth after dash
[0:56:25] <steff_mcbee> It's hidden until a certain point in the narrative, chat
[0:56:29] <+Javaa01> Breaks tracking at the end of the dash
[0:56:29] <Ipsenscastle> check menu just in case
[0:56:30] <%byuniart> Ah
[0:56:31] <Vashido22> SourPls
[0:56:32] <Daxalog> Mask on dash is good on TURN
[0:56:36] <namelez1> basicly it steaths just long enough to recover
[0:56:40] <lol_red_ranger> backbackbackback
[0:56:43] <%Jaxnos> WHAT A JERK
[0:56:43] <heartlesshealer> a Jerk
[0:56:44] <+whoguru5> I love how abilities act as buffs to other abilities like that
[0:56:45] <RiverBirch> JERK - 2.0
[0:56:46] <%AzureGale> Designation: Jerk
[0:56:47] <+Toblo1> Ya Joik!
[0:56:48] <AwkwardPon> you just need to use the functions in the 3 spots, the primary, sub and the passives which are on the side.
[0:56:49] <%Piemen99> Oh wow Pat actually playing a game a hour into the stream
[0:56:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[0:56:51] <+whoguru5> it's clever as heck
[0:56:54] <dukenux> Jerk DansGame
[0:56:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man, this voice actor is really good at just holding the entire game on the strength of his performance alone.
[0:56:59] <jfp4life> Hey Pat, Jaunt() is more Turn() efficient than walking in battle
[0:57:01] <Vashido22> jerk 2.0 is the greatest name
[0:57:04] <Saltmeisterr> beeg jerk
[0:57:04] <dinnydanny777> This humming really reminds me of another game but I can't think what it is
[0:57:08] <heartlesshealer> Pat
[0:57:11] <Ipsenscastle> continuing the theme of enemies named for insults
[0:57:12] <+Javaa01> You should always aim to get backstabs
[0:57:23] <%Mendin> @dinnydanny777 Eurydice's song from Hades?
[0:57:25] <%superc37> @patstaresat pat combos do more damage
[0:57:29] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> SUB OPTIMAL PLAY, PAT
[0:57:31] <marvel877> Oh, shit, an actual stream today... I'm slightly disappointed...
[0:57:46] <Saltmeisterr> is Young Lady an insult?
[0:57:48] <dinnydanny777> @mendin Nah, I've never played that, it would probably be something older too
[0:57:50] <dukenux> Do Combo
[0:58:03] <snakemuho> OVERKILL
[0:58:10] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[0:58:10] <Vashido22> yeyeye overkill that bitch
[0:58:17] <heartlesshealer> Fight Creeps
[0:58:17] <+whoguru5> I do like this game there's a reason I got it again fro switch
[0:58:21] <steff_mcbee> @dinnydanny777 Possibly some oldschool Elder Scrolls music, maybe?
[0:58:21] <%byuniart> You gotta use Jaunt pat!
[0:58:22] <+xeros720> don't you have a normal melee attack?
[0:58:25] <Garry_Guyface> Verjerk
[0:58:27] <Ipsenscastle> you can see their projected health while planning
[0:58:32] <%CJett92> This is one of those games where I say literally every song is my favorite song
[0:58:34] <snakemuho> @xeros720 no
[0:58:39] <dinnydanny777> @steff_mcbee Yeah that could be it I guess
[0:58:39] <heartlesshealer> Always Carve, Pat
[0:58:40] <%Divryne> @PatStaresAt You can manually aim if you hold the attack button I think.
[0:58:40] <stormhawk9891> @xeros720 Nope
[0:58:42] <circular7> crazy talk
[0:58:44] <+xeros720> oh, okay
[0:58:48] <$Dakuu75> what good fighting-gameplay this game has
[0:58:49] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @xeros720 nope, it's all functions
[0:58:52] <%Divryne> In turn mode.
[0:58:53] <+xeros720> i thought you had a little something when you weren't planning
[0:58:56] <Vashido22> during planning
[0:58:56] <%angel949> in plannimg
[0:58:59] <AwkwardPon> always use spark for non turn attacking in tight situations like that, its the safest option for that
[0:59:01] <Coystick> I am a genius. Oh no!
[0:59:05] <%JaydenSai> During planning
[0:59:05] <%Deadpal> there ya go!
[0:59:05] <Daxalog> While in TURN[]
[0:59:06] <Vashido22> the game told you tho LUL
[0:59:07] <%Divryne> Yeeted.
[0:59:09] <+whoguru5> Also out of fucking NOWHERE rct3 is coming to switch, seems frontier got the rights back from atari
[0:59:11] <$Dakuu75> gj Chat
[0:59:14] <AwkwardPon> be a spark simp
[0:59:14] <+pectusumbra> yeah, it said that earlier but you might have missed it
[0:59:16] <mastermidget23> @cjett92 Theyre all good but I definitely give it to "We all become
[0:59:20] <$Dakuu75> GJ ONE GUY, you didn't fuck it up this time
[0:59:28] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> admittedly transistor's gameplay is better if you take it as a turn based game
[0:59:29] <xnashamin> please use jaunt pat
[0:59:30] <%topendbuzza> shit's fucked
[0:59:33] <T_Sasquatch> Thanks one guy

[0:59:48] <+oda_flobunaga> its computerona
[0:59:49] <%rdark_ksu> yea thats what turned me off it way back when
[0:59:49] <+whoguru5> still looks beautiful
[0:59:49] <%CJett92> @mastermidget23 you aint wrong
[0:59:50] <Ipsenscastle> Transistor has the vaguest story out of all their games by far
[0:59:51] <T_Sasquatch> Transistor is a strategy game LUL
[0:59:52] <StencilOST> Process is the eva orange juice
[0:59:53] <%superc37> @patstaresat trust me itll be explained later
[0:59:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> BIEKS
[0:59:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> Transistor has the strongest aesthetic of all their games imo
[0:59:55] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt Might wanna read what they functions do at the access point
[0:59:57] <%Mendin> Yeah you're gonna be vague for like 2/3 game minimum
[1:00:00] <Dragon_Batman> It's the slow trickle
[1:00:03] <%angel949> that one is res
[1:00:07] <+whoguru5> limesMusic
[1:00:08] <%angel949> *red
[1:00:08] <%Divryne> It's all analogies for computer stuff and shit.

[1:07:13] <dukenux> ah i think now you can read function files
[1:07:20] <superbla25> inspect function
[1:07:20] <penitentpentwitch> Missed some lore in there
[1:07:21] <Ipsenscastle> Y to inspect
[1:07:22] <%superc37> NOW you can read lore
[1:07:25] <%AzureGale> It's a charm spell
[1:07:27] <%Daniel_Is_I> ALWAYS read terminals
[1:07:29] <dukenux> Inspect
[1:07:30] <not_twitter_rowan> you can read the big lore now @PatStaresAt
[1:07:31] <Vashido22> now you can read lore
[1:07:34] <%topendbuzza> you can read lore now with y
[1:07:48] <Dragon_Batman> Marin karin that shit
[1:07:56] <AMUSERNAME> Music, Linguistics
[1:08:05] <namelez1> Lore
[1:08:06] <Vashido22> this is some GOOD ASS lore
[1:08:09] <%Mendin> The mechanic of "Every piece of equipment is actually just a junctionable move OR a move modifier" is a fun one
[1:08:11] <+yukichocomilk> I love this game <3
[1:08:15] <%topendbuzza> you can see what you need to unlock with bottomright
[1:08:17] <%pepzi_boyz> pepzi_boyz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! money for the puppy
[1:08:29] <+linSP> I love me some ass lore
[1:08:33] <+cowkid222> is this Pat's first time playing?
[1:08:36] <penitentpentwitch> "How dare you choose arts in our Civics College!?"
[1:08:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> Use skill, get more lore
[1:08:52] <+yukichocomilk> you get more lore
[1:09:00] <RiverBirch> Use skill in certain slots
[1:09:07] <penitentpentwitch> @cowkid222 He said he's played it before, but didn't beat it
[1:09:09] <critfumble_> the ADMINS
[1:09:10] <snakemuho> this guy's pretty good
[1:09:11] <filialpails> using each function in each type of slot unlocks more lore
[1:09:13] <Ipsenscastle> the decryption mechanic is such a clever way to encourage experimentation
[1:09:13] <SaltyAzteca> You put the functions in different slots
[1:09:13] <AMUSERNAME> Trickery, Comedy. IT YOU! Kappa
[1:09:15] <heartlesshealer> Use skill in different ways/forms
[1:09:15] <dukenux> @PatStaresAt besides lore the other bookmarks inform on good function combos
[1:09:16] <+oda_flobunaga> Its just a prank bro
[1:09:24] <RiverBirch> AKA - Main Slot - Passive Slot - Self Slot
[1:09:24] <%angel949> feets
[1:09:28] <%Andrizzleton> Everybody wears masks right?
[1:09:28] <+cowkid222> @penitentpentwitch thanks
[1:09:30] <farrellcityking> Stream keeps stopping for me
[1:09:36] <dukenux> DB Cooper?
[1:09:50] <%superc37> @it means that if you plop the skill in an upgrade for another skill OR in a passive slot and complete a fight and come back, youll get more lore
[1:09:51] <dinnydanny777> Xemnas?
[1:09:59] <AMUSERNAME> Physics, Negotiation
[1:10:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I got an Alert for Woolie, did not get an Alert for Pat, starting to think Twitch doesn't like Pat
[1:10:26] <Darkfire346> jesus christ, another 80gb patch for Modern Warfare? The fuck?
[1:10:29] <penitentpentwitch> Good ole "The Country"
[1:10:34] <heartlesshealer> Moving to the Country
[1:10:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> Country being capitalized
[1:10:38] <%superc37> "move to the country"
[1:10:40] <penitentpentwitch> Subtlest reference
[1:10:42] <Ipsenscastle> See you in the Country
[1:10:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> So all of these people are dead, right?
[1:10:49] <AMUSERNAME> Reflexes, Machinery
[1:10:50] <xnashamin> Moving out to the Country
[1:10:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> What the actual fuck.
[1:10:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> 1200cc?!
[1:10:58] <critfumble_> FAST
[1:10:58] <%Mendin> @CommanderSqueaks It's complicated
[1:10:59] <namelez1> red still alive
[1:11:09] <reonome> go fast
[1:11:11] <%superc37> @commandersqueaks eeeh more like their soul is in the sword now
[1:11:11] <dinnydanny777> Imagine 1200 cc Mario Kart
[1:11:11] <+Merhabi> many ccs
[1:11:12] <penitentpentwitch> @CommanderSqueaks That is the implication in universe
[1:11:14] <+LandOfTheWay> @CommanderSqueaks "dead" is kind of a relative concept in this setting. it'll become a bit more clear
[1:11:14] <DianaTheAscian> u hear about how the scott pilgrim game is back Pat? @PatStaresAt
[1:11:14] <%topendbuzza> ah yes 12 litre motorbikes'
[1:11:15] <+StooEsq> WipEout Zero
[1:11:15] <Dragon_Batman> I liked PReston
[1:11:17] <snakemuho> kinda dead but their "souls" get absorbed by Transistor @CommanderSqueaks
[1:11:17] <timblenaut> KINDA
[1:11:18] <+mikesapartment> hmmmmmmmmm
[1:11:18] <+Merhabi> big big ccs
[1:11:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Dead-ish if i have to guess
[1:11:19] <%Buzzard42> psaBig engine
[1:11:21] <ulcaban> Red not dead
[1:11:22] <%D00msDayDan> red alive redemption
[1:11:23] <Garry_Guyface> FADST
[1:11:26] <%CJett92> "Integrated" more like
[1:11:27] <not_twitter_rowan> @CommanderSqueaks Don't be silly, they're not dead, they're Processed
[1:11:29] <Rhinoprotoss> Disappeared more like
[1:11:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> Use function to learn more!
[1:11:34] <Dragon_Batman> Well, they are still alive ish
[1:11:35] <+Javaa01> No lore unless you use the ability
[1:11:35] <heartlesshealer> Weather Lady -dead-
[1:11:36] <dukenux> no info huh
[1:11:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are we dealing with some Ghost in the Shell nonsense?
[1:11:41] <%coreyyotto> Pat terminal
[1:11:42] <Darkfire346> I have a 1000cc 78HP motorcycle myself. Shit gets real, real quick
[1:11:48] <%superc37> @patstaresat the status on the left side indicates whether theyre dead, alive, or copied
[1:11:49] <snakemuho> noone's ever really gone Kappa
[1:11:52] <InfinitySaiyan> I LOVE TRANSISTOR
[1:11:57] <%Buzzard42> I don't remember if it's explicitly stated anywhere, but the implication is that the Process is the system that people used to modify the city
[1:12:04] <not_twitter_rowan> @CommanderSqueaks very vague for most of the game
[1:12:26] <InfinitySaiyan> I always mix jaunt with breach
[1:12:30] <penitentpentwitch> @CommanderSqueaks When a person is 'processed' they become the powerups Red grabs. Technically they're still alive.
[1:12:41] <%CalderGaming> (for comparison, chat, motoGP, the F1 of track motorcycle racing, is 1000cc)
[1:12:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't use Breach for the most part, too slow
[1:12:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> I forget, do you have to use the function in a fight to unlock the lore or do you just have to use it?
[1:12:44] <heartlesshealer> I guess
[1:12:51] <Vashido22> there's A LOT of combinations
[1:12:52] <Ipsenscastle> I guarantee you'll find something overpowered before long, don't worry
[1:12:57] <dukenux> integrated. assimilated.
[1:12:58] <%JaydenSai> @Daniel_Is_I Fight with it
[1:13:01] <%iamnolionheart> Yeah there's a bit more depth here than Bastion's gear up and go
[1:13:01] <+pectusumbra> Is this is a new form of immortality for Pat to embrace or reject?
[1:13:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I TOTALLY missed Mask every time I played, holy crap
[1:13:04] <penitentpentwitch> @Daniel_Is_I In a fight, I believe
[1:13:05] <%topendbuzza> this game is anit ocd for pat
[1:13:05] <+mikesapartment> pick the attacks you like then slap the rest on
[1:13:05] <%Mendin> Take your time, Pat, the game is early
[1:13:06] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @Daniel_Is_I I believe you have to complete an encounter with it
[1:13:06] <critfumble_> in new game plus you get ANOTHER SET OF ALL THE MOVES
[1:13:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> So you can put Functions either as a core function or as a modifier, right?
[1:13:10] <InfinitySaiyan> i always let my dodge do damage because it rules
[1:13:10] <dukenux> Let's... oh you mean in game?
[1:13:13] <T_Sasquatch> @daniel_is_i you need to use it in 3 different ways I think
[1:13:17] <xnashamin> JAUNT NOICE
[1:13:18] <snakemuho> every move does 1 of 3 things only, it's easier if you think about it that way @PatStaresAt
[1:13:25] <%JaydenSai> @CommanderSqueaks correct!
[1:13:27] <AMUSERNAME> The material system STARTS NOW PogChamp
[1:13:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> Stun-dash!
[1:13:32] <AMUSERNAME> *materia
[1:13:33] <%superc37> @commandersqueaks or as a passive. but pat hasnt unlocked that slot yet.
[1:13:33] <%Andrizzleton> spark is so busted
[1:13:34] <Dragon_Batman> Yep @CommanderSqueaks
[1:13:34] <penitentpentwitch> @CommanderSqueaks Correct!
[1:13:35] <T_Sasquatch> Functions PogChamp
[1:13:46] <Ipsenscastle> VROOM
[1:13:46] <%superc37> ITS A GOOD ASS SYSTEM
[1:13:49] <AMUSERNAME> Enjoy your new Materia system, Pat!
[1:13:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Spark is so fast
[1:13:54] <+primax104> the function system in this game is awesome
[1:14:03] <%iamnolionheart> I totally didn't get that these were programming jokes until like a year after I played it
[1:14:03] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @CommanderSqueaks Yep. Every move has an active effect, a secondary effect that modifies the actives, and a passive effect that improves Red.
[1:14:05] <%Daniel_Is_I> IT CAN BE
[1:14:07] <%angel949> it is
[1:14:09] <%topendbuzza> it is
[1:14:10] <T_Sasquatch> Speaking of materia. Im level 57 and still never used materia in ffxiv
[1:14:10] <+NeonLight> Replay value up the wazoo
[1:14:13] <%Buzzard42> it's actually not!
[1:14:14] <%TheWinged7> thats because it is
[1:14:17] <%Andrizzleton> there are so many combos
[1:14:17] <namelez1> mask also adds a damage buff
[1:14:22] <critfumble_> you'll get the hang of it quick
[1:14:22] <timblenaut> its narrow but deep
[1:14:22] <+GoneWithLaw> i looooooooove this game
[1:14:24] <reonome> just stick with crash the whole game Kappa
[1:14:27] <Dragon_Batman> It pretty much is
[1:14:27] <%sirisvirus> the upgrade system is so much fun to play with
[1:14:27] <T_Sasquatch> Pace yourself and focus on one thing at a time
[1:14:28] <heartlesshealer> so check that fucking officer name
[1:14:29] <+primax104> and tying it to unlocking lore files makes you want to try all combos
[1:14:29] <InfinitySaiyan> I do jaunt breach. what about you guys?
[1:14:30] <user_naim> You can fucking break it
[1:14:32] <dukenux> post a toxic tweet
[1:14:36] <penitentpentwitch> @T_Sasquatch Until endgame, materia is mostly a small buff while leveling
[1:14:37] <%CJett92> on NG+, you get extra copies of each ability, so it can get even more complex
[1:14:37] <Garry_Guyface> ehh it's not though
[1:14:38] <Dragon_Batman> Creativity explodes
[1:14:39] <Calek> @T_Sasquatch I have 400+ hours and I haven't used it either
[1:14:41] <reonome> LIGMA
[1:14:43] <%topendbuzza> sassy red
[1:14:43] <dukenux> DONT BELIEVE THEIR LIES
[1:14:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love that she back spaced.
[1:14:48] <SaltyAzteca> Ligma Bauls Kappa
[1:14:54] <+yukichocomilk> "POGGERS"
[1:14:57] <namelez1> jaunt bounce breach to omnislash
[1:14:58] <+pectusumbra> Warning: If you die in a fight, it locks one of your processes until you can reach a terminal I believe
[1:15:03] <%Aleate> L I G M A
[1:15:04] <T_Sasquatch> @penitentpentwitch bruh.... LUL
[1:15:06] <%Valdorick> Ligma balls, hah hah hah
[1:15:13] <Fro5tburn> hey. hey come here. guess what? Ligma
[1:15:13] <dukenux> "It's the 5g towers"
[1:15:16] <%Andrizzleton> *eekum bokum*
[1:15:25] <T_Sasquatch> WEED
[1:15:29] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @pectusumbra I'm looking forward to Pat discovering this himself
[1:15:31] <%topendbuzza> dash uses less turn than walking
[1:15:34] <%Andrizzleton> atpSuspect
[1:15:40] <jfp4life> 6 seconds or attacking ends stealth
[1:15:40] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt try mask with crash
[1:15:43] <dukenux> dude Weed
[1:15:53] <+primax104> red's humming
[1:15:59] <%Valdorick> Eekum Ligma
[1:16:08] <xnashamin> jaunt + purge for some DOT shenanigans, void + spark for stacking debuff, crash, and then breach
[1:16:10] <+primax104> Ligma Bokum?
[1:16:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh the ground eels heal
[1:16:18] <dukenux> Weed, creeps, jerks and young ladys.
[1:16:25] <%angel949> lol
[1:16:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ok, so conversation: no matter how I feel about Ubisoft, I am cautiously excited to play "Gods and Monsters Renamed"
[1:16:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> Switching twice reverts
[1:16:31] <dukenux> sounds like a normal nightlife
[1:16:40] <RedHotBoss> I hope you like this game man. this is my favorite supergiant jam
[1:16:41] <dinnydanny777> And then you bop it
[1:16:47] <+pectusumbra> you can't hurt charmed enemies
[1:16:54] <snakemuho> Switch also can get you soft-locked in some cases lol
[1:17:01] <Tisaric> SourPls
[1:17:05] <InfinitySaiyan> I love the aesthetic and feel of this game so fuckin much
[1:17:06] <xnashamin> switch is better in a sub slot
[1:17:07] <%JaydenSai> If you switch an enemy you cant hurt them until you switch them back @PatStaresAt
[1:17:08] <ulcaban> Never stop Crashing
[1:17:14] <+bluedude153> has paige yelled at the game for having music yet
[1:17:17] <+Th47guy> Best combo is crash( ),crash( ),crash( ),crash( ),crash( ),crash( )
[1:17:21] <%iamnolionheart> Just so you know, using Jaunt during Turn is more efficient than just moving, and you get a damage bonus for variety in a combo
[1:17:39] <masheshardest> I am aware of the effect my music has on people.
[1:17:50] <+itIsJustMat> itIsJustMat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! psaRaffle
[1:17:58] <%Andrizzleton> dramatic singers the game
[1:18:03] <Tisaric> I love how sword man is just a big ass ??????
[1:18:03] <%superc37> "WE DONT KNOW SHIT"
[1:18:10] <namelez1> you dont have a passive slot yet, so lore locked for a bit
[1:18:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> LORE
[1:18:18] <%Daniel_Is_I> So nobody in cloudbank opted out of census data collection
[1:18:20] <Dragon_Batman> Shits corrupt
[1:18:20] <+LandOfTheWay> can't process data that ain't there
[1:18:28] <not_twitter_rowan> Mr. Nobody is my spirit animal, what a die-hard libertarian chad
[1:18:39] <InfinitySaiyan> Jaunt plus breach equals a damaging dodge that is more effiecient than WALKING in turn
[1:18:52] <not_twitter_rowan> "fuck the government data" says Mr. Nobody
[1:18:58] <Tisaric> God I love the world of cloudbank
[1:19:09] <Tisaric> it's such a cool setting
[1:19:10] <Garry_Guyface> mr.nobody is an anarchist and not a libertarian
[1:19:22] <%topendbuzza> yon-dale GayPride
[1:19:27] <not_twitter_rowan> eh
[1:19:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Garry_Guyface Some people literally don't know the difference and it's hilarious
[1:19:42] <not_twitter_rowan> no evidence for anarchy
[1:19:43] <%Aleate> Delete all that shit, here comes MONGO
[1:19:44] <dinnydanny777> Is Mr Nobody Mansex from Kingdom Hearts?
[1:19:46] <penitentpentwitch> Just got back from the grocery store. Had to wait for 15 minutes in line while a woman and her 3 kids argued with a guard that refused to let her in.
[1:19:47] <RedHotBoss> I wish I had a hyphenated name... :\
[1:19:50] <not_twitter_rowan> just evidence for "get the fuck out goverment"
[1:19:56] <dukenux> setting dash as passive? bold move
[1:20:01] <+lordericter> just make sure you keep one form of evasion always Pat
[1:20:04] <ulcaban> Mr. Nobody actually likes showering, but forgets to do it for days
[1:20:06] <dukenux> though maybe better now than later
[1:20:09] <+lordericter> otherwise some bosses will rock you
[1:20:15] <%TheWinged7> @RedHotBoss ok mr Red-Hot-Boss
[1:20:18] <namelez1> mask is also usable in turn recovery
[1:20:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ulcaban Oh no, he's a Melee player?
[1:20:24] <$SubjectTea> does paige still hate the game?
[1:20:25] <heartlesshealer> Can you turn your dash into a brainwash?
[1:20:29] <dukenux> bleh, i meant *Jaunt
[1:20:32] <+lordericter> oh no
[1:20:34] <Garry_Guyface> I fucking bet Mr. Nobody hates Skub
[1:20:34] <+Javaa01> You already had Charm standalone though
[1:20:39] <penitentpentwitch> Has Pat 'died' once yet?
[1:20:42] <not_twitter_rowan> @CommanderSqueaks kinda LUL
[1:20:43] <RedHotBoss> @TheWinged7 doodThirst doodThirst doodThirst
[1:20:48] <Vashido22> no
[1:20:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> He has not
[1:20:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SubjectTea She just seems to hate humming in general?
[1:20:54] <Tisaric> God the variations on every skill are so cool too
[1:20:56] <Ipsenscastle> Fuck Skub for real
[1:21:01] <RiverBirch> Crash + Jaunt = FAST STAB
[1:21:06] <Tisaric> there's so many fucking combinations
[1:21:06] <Saltmeisterr> heres a real question: can the Transistor play doom?
[1:21:07] <penitentpentwitch> So we haven't explained the life system yet, good
[1:21:17] <dukenux> FBBlock VirtualHug VirtualHug VirtualHug
[1:21:17] <$SubjectTea> @CommanderSqueaks that sucks :/
[1:21:17] <not_twitter_rowan> He's a boxer, which is technically illegal, he's literally in Fight Club
[1:21:21] <ulcaban> Mr Nobody thnks Radiohead is so fucking deep you guys
[1:21:22] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> This game looks rad
[1:21:23] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @penitentpentwitch no and I am ecstatic at the idea
[1:21:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> POTE ABLE?
[1:21:26] <namelez1> jaunt is also one of the best modifers
[1:21:29] <heartlesshealer> boil your water
[1:21:35] <Vashido22> SourPls
[1:21:38] <%Totally_Not_Toby> potent potables
[1:21:39] <%D00msDayDan> to pote up a cat
[1:21:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Potent Potable
[1:21:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt pot-able water means its safe for human consumption
[1:21:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh fuck I've been pronouncing it as POT able. Just looked it up. Man I'm a fucking idiot.
[1:21:53] <RedHotBoss> @ShichiNoBushi this
[1:21:54] <%angel949> @heartlesshealer nah bro that suits gay
[1:21:55] <penitentpentwitch> @TallGuyWithAHoodie In a way it's both more punishing and forgiving than Bastions. I'm ambivalent on it.
[1:21:57] <%Broand> They continued with a lot of these ideas in hades
[1:21:59] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yep Pote-able is correct, amazingly
[1:22:03] <%angel949> *shits
[1:22:06] <Louie_Salmon> Wow I played like this entire game as a turn-based thing, interesting seeing it played more like Bastion
[1:22:08] <ulcaban> Half the time it feels like you're fighting a screensaver
[1:22:09] <RyuuAoi> Is this #Sponsored?
[1:22:10] <+pectusumbra> note, you can switch a cheerleader to make you immune instead for a bit
[1:22:20] <RedHotBoss> that water has GAY MEMORY
[1:22:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @doc_ock_rokc It actually is PODE able. I just looked it up. Yes, it's confusing as fuck.
[1:22:21] <Tisaric> there's so much DNA of Hades throughout all of Supergiant's games
[1:22:29] <snakemuho> these Packets are what gets lost by wifi players
[1:22:29] <penitentpentwitch> Switched healers are great in this
[1:22:30] <ape_hawk> fat poomer said dank
[1:22:32] <%topendbuzza> yeah is is like hades .5
[1:22:32] <%angel949> @ryuuaoi nope
[1:22:33] <ape_hawk> unsubbing
[1:22:35] <$Dakuu75> what was that gold glowy orb abover her head?
[1:22:35] <+bluedude153> Why would a decade old game be #sponsored
[1:22:39] <Tisaric> and no it's not sponsored he's just playing them before Hades
[1:22:41] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt charm the next cheerleader so you get invuln instead
[1:22:44] <Vashido22> healers
[1:22:44] <Louie_Salmon> Healers
[1:22:45] <AMUSERNAME> @PatStaresAt if you don't "spend" your entire allotted Turn, it recharges faster
[1:22:47] <heartlesshealer> Healers
[1:22:48] <Vashido22> no, its healers now
[1:22:53] <%iamnolionheart> Honestly yeah, basically
[1:22:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> I'm fine with them cannibalizing their own games
[1:22:54] <Calek> Hadlers
[1:22:55] <penitentpentwitch> I wish I could hit people to heal them, the Catharsis
[1:22:56] <+yukichocomilk> I loved Healers
[1:23:01] <RiverBirch> [ H E A L E R S ]
[1:23:02] <%Buzzard42> Bastion fuckin whips
[1:23:02] <%DappercatEsquire> i appreciate they have a pretty solid game design throughline
[1:23:02] <Ipsenscastle> The next game will be even more Hades than Hades
[1:23:04] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @Dakuu75 Turn being on cooldown
[1:23:04] <%CJett92> Healers, Ruler of the Underworld
[1:23:06] <Dragon_Batman> Nice, the hit new game healers
[1:23:09] <Louie_Salmon> Quick, make a Sbubby of Healers
[1:23:13] <RiverBirch> Where you play as Healer's Son, White Mage
[1:23:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> A lot of shit seems to happen in Goldwalk.
[1:23:18] <Saltmeisterr> the exalted in elysium function almost exactly like the process
[1:23:20] <%iamnolionheart> Bastion's combat flow, Transistor's variable skill and boon system, and Pyre's relationship ideas and mechanics
[1:23:25] <RedHotBoss> @yukichocomilk Crazy Daimond
[1:23:26] <Saltmeisterr> its crazy
[1:23:26] <Tisaric> Like even Pyre has a ton of shit that went on to Hades despite being such a weird system
[1:23:34] <%topendbuzza> 228%
[1:23:37] <%topendbuzza> speed
[1:23:38] <%Andrizzleton> gotta go fast!
[1:23:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Gotta go fast
[1:23:49] <+oda_flobunaga> Its like David Cage making the same shit over and over again but good
[1:23:49] <%Buzzard42> SPEED
[1:23:51] <%iamnolionheart> nyoom
[1:23:53] <Garry_Guyface> Healers, where you have to escape haven and are surrounded by hunky girls
[1:23:53] <namelez1> the northwest sector
[1:23:54] <%D00msDayDan> he doesn't just want to, he's got to
[1:23:54] <InfinitySaiyan> @RedHotBoss just not gonna acknowledge the Jonathan and his hamon

[1:23:56] <%angel949> I am Speed
[1:23:57] <Ipsenscastle> gotta go to bed, night chat, have fun!
[1:23:58] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Preston "Ricky Bobby" Moyle
[1:24:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt His quote is literally "I want to go fast"
[1:24:10] <critfumble_> captain kenway what are your orders sah? GOT TO GOO FAST
[1:24:12] <%Mendin> But did he also eat ass?
[1:24:13] <xnashamin> speedyboi
[1:24:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @oda_flobunaga It's like ACDC, who has openly admitting to remaking the same album their entire career, but they're all great.
[1:24:19] <RedHotBoss> infinitesaiyan IM SORRY
[1:24:25] <heartlesshealer> charming dash
[1:24:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> ACDC has one song, but it's a really good song.
[1:24:29] <Tisaric> It feels more like they're taking the same functions and stuff from bastion and just rejiggering them to new games
[1:24:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Is Cloudbank a cyberscape or a real place with some sort of computer technology integrated into it?
[1:24:34] <%topendbuzza> yes switch on dash is great
[1:24:34] <+oda_flobunaga> Word
[1:24:37] <AMUSERNAME> @PatStaresAt if you don't "spend" your entire allotted Turn, it recharges faster
[1:24:49] <Daxalog> How charming
[1:25:00] <%TheWinged7> @AMUSERNAME whats your PM username?
[1:25:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> F E E T

[1:25:05] <%FacetiousAF> don't tell reggie
[1:25:07] <ape_hawk> you just zip past someone and hit on them
[1:25:07] <Tisaric> @ShichiNoBushi it's kind of part of the story and also left a bit vague intentionally
[1:25:08] <pixelandarilho> so let me get this right, you hava a sword that can create dvil may cry like abilites from making contact with other people... Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:25:10] <dukenux> prove it Kappa

[1:25:59] <%nmaten> the cool part about this game is you can play it how you want and have fun

[1:28:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> I just realized the YoungLady processes have a booty.
[1:28:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why do they have the booty?
[1:28:18] <dukenux> young ladies become pain in the ass later
[1:28:22] <heartlesshealer> go southwest please
[1:28:27] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt You can collect in Turn
[1:28:29] <heartlesshealer> or direct south
[1:28:32] <Dragon_Batman> Why not have a booty?
[1:28:34] <snakemuho> @CommanderSqueaks they're young ladies Kappa

[1:28:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @snakemuho I didn't know I'd be attracted to computer processes, but here we are.
[1:29:12] <BlackMage66652> What is the horny level of this game?
[1:29:14] <dukenux> uh oh
[1:29:14] <snakemuho> @CommanderSqueaks they also breed a lot of cells
[1:29:15] <%topendbuzza> "sky is blue cause we want it to"
[1:29:17] <Daxalog> uh oh
[1:29:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> This entire world seems both amazing and marred in bureaucratic nonsense
[1:29:28] <ape_hawk> oh no its pat
[1:29:33] <Dragon_Batman> Do some shit to lower the sentence? why not?
[1:29:40] <Tisaric> it's like a 3/10 horny level
[1:29:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is he dead?
[1:29:45] <namelez1> to far gone

[1:29:47] <%topendbuzza> he was nithing
[1:29:48] <+oda_flobunaga> THe level is, Transistor I don't even know her.
[1:29:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> He's too far gone, he gave you nothing
[1:29:50] <ape_hawk> nothing
[1:29:50] <%Broand> Wiped him out
[1:29:51] <penitentpentwitch> Too far gone
[1:29:52] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> "When everything changes, nothing changes."
[1:29:53] <ape_hawk> hes nothing
[1:29:53] <+Javaa01> Too far gone for recovery
[1:29:53] <Tisaric> there's that little bit of horn but it's not a ton
[1:29:54] <Vashido22> too far gone
[1:29:55] <heartlesshealer> too far gone
[1:29:55] <aeonicvector> "he's too far gone"
[1:29:56] <%CJett92> too far gone
[1:29:58] <%coreyyotto> corpse (nothing)
[1:30:02] <Rhinoprotoss> Didn't just say
[1:30:09] <heartlesshealer> dead for real-real
[1:30:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> corpse(nothing) still remains strong.
[1:30:09] <namelez1> super ded
[1:30:19] <critfumble_> they wouldnt let you miss moves
[1:30:22] <critfumble_> its fine
[1:30:27] <%CJett92> Mask on jaunt is good to get away fast
[1:30:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> They're great augments
[1:30:30] <Tisaric> just wait till you get the passives
[1:30:35] <Saltmeisterr> mask and crash is really good
[1:30:35] <RedHotBoss> Im excited for the booty boss comin up
[1:30:36] <heartlesshealer> yeah, they're good add-on effects
[1:30:39] <ape_hawk> the skill system is v indepth
[1:30:39] <jfp4life> put mask on breach fro big number
[1:30:39] <%angel949> they nice upgrades
[1:30:39] <%Andrizzleton> they're good buffs
[1:30:42] <Tisaric> There's so many fucking combinations once you have passives as well
[1:30:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Mask comes in handy in specific cases but yeah they are not great
[1:30:46] <snakemuho> Mask gives a lot of backstab on its own for the first used attack @PatStaresAt
[1:30:48] <penitentpentwitch> Some effects are better as passives. Some become viable with a different passive linked into them.
[1:30:51] <dukenux> some of these are just straight up made to be passives
[1:30:57] <dukenux> though i found use for mask
[1:30:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RedHotBoss More games need strangely attractive enemies.
[1:31:04] <dukenux> and spark
[1:31:07] <AMUSERNAME> Jaunt() + Spark() is pretty cool
[1:31:11] <%frumpsdumpy> using them as main moves is the only way to get the stories for them though (I think)
[1:31:27] <+jaaaa_mes> why does the sword sound kinda like solid snake
[1:31:27] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Facts reported: 4. Gossip reported: 231354
[1:31:33] <MementoCaedes> everyon playing among us damnit
[1:31:34] <Tisaric> yeah you have to do at least one battle with them in each slot for the full lore
[1:31:41] <%codycurry52> the bombs are good to add to the sword attack.
[1:31:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> I like how she rewrites her comments a couple times before posting.
[1:31:49] <%Andrizzleton> Red's dead baby. Red's dead.
[1:31:53] <RedHotBoss> @CommanderSqueaks gotta weakness for robo bootys and this game makes me thirst!
[1:32:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> The backtracking on her own comments adds a lot of character.
[1:32:13] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> YOOOO we in there
[1:32:13] <namelez1> if you dont walk up to the boss right away the boss will sing a certain song
[1:32:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RedHotBoss Robot booty is a close second to monster girl booty, but I'll take it.
[1:32:19] <Saltmeisterr> i wish ping was better as a main ability
[1:32:28] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> fracking Transistor is dag bess
[1:32:52] <filialpails> you'll unlock more slots later
[1:32:52] <Garry_Guyface> Oh it's playing The Spine on the way in
[1:32:56] <Vashido22> "what if I..." yes, welcome to transistor
[1:33:05] <Tisaric> god the combinations probably took so much fucking work
[1:33:07] <Tisaric> there's so many
[1:33:18] <0rond> you know I never noticed but every "main protagaonist" in super giant games is red
[1:33:21] <RedHotBoss> @CommanderSqueaks I want something with the first law programmed in. not big on the possibility of gettin vored lol
[1:33:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Vashido22 Or, you could say "If, then" Kappa
[1:33:31] <%topendbuzza> oof
[1:33:36] <0rond> all of them have red as a main color
[1:33:37] <dukenux> Betting against yourself, smart
[1:33:39] <SaltyAzteca> Chat will remember that
[1:33:42] <Vashido22> boo @CommanderSqueaks
[1:33:46] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Transistor's great, but I still prefer Bastion :/
[1:33:46] <AMUSERNAME> PogChamp
[1:33:47] <Tisaric> Supergiant definitely likes them some red colors

[1:39:02] <%Shadicara> Just don't get hit Kappa
[1:39:02] <%luftraumm1> woolie would be SCREAMING
[1:39:02] <not_twitter_rowan> God Sybil is such a psycho bitch
[1:39:09] <+Toblo1> You lose an ability every time you run out of "health"

[1:39:10] <Garry_Guyface> AWW YEAH
[1:39:14] <devanmuse> holy shit, dying breaks one of your skills
[1:39:14] <%Shadicara> WEED
[1:39:15] <penitentpentwitch> Every 'death' you get loses you an ability. You will always keep a combat ability until your 4th and last life.
[1:39:19] <Tisaric> THE VOCALS
[1:39:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why did Pat just walk into that Weed and take damage?
[1:39:22] <heartlesshealer> This version of the song >:
[1:39:23] <Vashido22> SourPls
[1:39:24] <Tisaric> IT'S SO FUCKING GOOD

[1:39:37] <%YakumoYomi> This track is soooo good
[1:39:38] <Dragon_Batman> Well you liked crash so much
[1:39:40] <%topendbuzza> now*
[1:39:40] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> the song itself is being processed
[1:39:43] <heartlesshealer> 98% processed
[1:39:43] <%CJett92> and the music gets more distorted as you go on yessssssssss
[1:39:46] <Rhinoprotoss> Wha happun?
[1:40:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is Pat just TAKING damage?
[1:40:01] <%iamnolionheart> If you have Turn up when you'd die it'll activate

[1:40:15] <Tisaric> _n C_rcl_s
[1:40:16] <+Javaa01> As long as you have a (Turn) left, it will be burned to prevent Function loss
[1:40:20] <Rhinoprotoss> So much wasted turn on wallking
[1:40:21] <+yukichocomilk> SourPls
[1:40:22] <namelez1> if you have a turn when u take fatal hit you get a free turn
[1:40:24] <penitentpentwitch> If you have full charge for a turn when you take a fatal hit, you're allowed an emergency turn. It is often a good idea to have charge so you don't lose a life.
[1:40:26] <Garry_Guyface> I love how the song applies to both of their points of view
[1:40:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> @CommanderSqueaks I don't think he understands her attack pierces walls
[1:40:30] <%CJett92> please please jaunt to move while in turn
[1:40:32] <Garry_Guyface> Lucky!
[1:40:39] <+Toblo1> Uh oh. That means Mask.

[1:40:40] <%Totally_Not_Toby> you're taking your boss with your boss with you
[1:40:47] <+oda_flobunaga> Still has Jaunt, Walks
[1:40:49] <Saltmeisterr> so next is mask
[1:40:50] <Daxalog> So youll lose stealth next
[1:40:52] <Saltmeisterr> woah
[1:40:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hey Pat, you realize her attacks are penetrating the walls and hitting you, right?
[1:40:58] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> really, I should've just waited for this boss fight to force him to plat smart
[1:41:01] <Saltmeisterr> i never knew that
[1:41:03] <+pectusumbra> so y will go next
[1:41:12] <%Shadicara> LUL
[1:41:14] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> sometimes it's better to dash instea
[1:41:16] <heartlesshealer> RIP Stealth
[1:41:17] <penitentpentwitch> Dash is next
[1:41:18] <Daxalog> Dashing in Turn is more effective
[1:41:19] <Vashido22> SourPls
[1:41:21] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> instead of run
[1:41:23] <%coreyyotto> and you don't get them back right?
[1:41:26] <%AzureGale> IT'S NOT OVER 'TIL IT'S OVER
[1:41:31] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt Jaunt is more effective for turn time
[1:41:35] <JaseAdrift> man pat is getting his ass kicked
[1:41:39] <+pectusumbra> that white blood is sick
[1:41:43] <%iamnolionheart> Hell yeah Pat
[1:41:44] <snakemuho> @coreyyotto you get them after 1-2 checkpoints
[1:41:46] <Tisaric> instead of running
[1:41:47] <aeonicvector> then walking
[1:41:48] <Tisaric> when paused
[1:41:49] <%CJett92> Use jaunt in turn instead of walking
[1:41:49] <+Javaa01> Jaunt takes less bar then walking
[1:41:49] <not_twitter_rowan> Fuck Sybil
[1:41:50] <SaltyAzteca> Dont walk
[1:41:50] <%luftraumm1> in the stoped time
[1:41:52] <$dalmek> instead of walking in turn, do a Jaunt, I think
[1:41:52] <SaltyAzteca> Jaunt
[1:41:53] <aeonicvector> your walking ALOT
[1:41:53] <not_twitter_rowan> the psycho
[1:41:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Jaunt instead of running in Turn
[1:41:53] <%topendbuzza> walking takes turn
[1:41:53] <%Piemono> Jaunt takes less bar
[1:41:55] <Klonoa__> Jaunt uses less turn than movement
[1:41:56] <%nmaten> takes less ap instead of walking
[1:41:56] <+pectusumbra> Jaunting in the frozen time uses less of it
[1:41:57] <Dragon_Batman> It doesn't cost alot in the bar
[1:41:58] <not_twitter_rowan> Jaunt don't walk
[1:41:58] <heartlesshealer> jaunt less time than walk
[1:41:59] <xnashamin> walking takes turn
[1:42:04] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> you'll cover more ground and use less meter
[1:42:06] <%superc37> @patstaresat jaunt is better than walking while in turn
[1:42:08] <Daxalog> Walking uses ALOT more turn then dashing
[1:42:17] <%codycurry52> I attack then use Jaunt to get the fuck out of there
[1:42:20] <Tisaric> you can use it more than once my dude
[1:42:20] <%Andrizzleton> it's 228% faster
[1:42:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hey, Pat is LEARNING
[1:42:25] <penitentpentwitch> @coreyyotto You have to go through a certain number of battles before you can use a 'broken' ability again. You CAN equip a different ability in that slot during that time while you wait, though.
[1:42:31] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> welp he still managed it

[1:43:42] <Lophostrix_> I always felt sorry for her
[1:43:44] <+pectusumbra> That's a hell of a Mega Man
[1:43:45] <Saltmeisterr> NO
[1:43:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> Maybe
[1:43:47] <%luftraumm1> nope
[1:43:48] <+mikesapartment> nope
[1:43:48] <%YakumoYomi> Nope
[1:43:48] <T_Sasquatch> No

[1:43:51] <%nmaten> nah
[1:43:51] <namelez1> friend is awesome
[1:43:51] <critfumble_> maybe
[1:43:51] <%angel949> Ehhhhhh
[1:43:51] <%ButtMcChuggles> ye
[1:43:52] <Vashido22> eehh
[1:43:52] <+Toblo1> Not really
[1:43:52] <snakemuho> It gets more clear by the end
[1:43:52] <+yukichocomilk> nah
[1:43:52] <Dragon_Batman> Aww yea the backdoor
[1:43:52] <+Javaa01> No, just keep reading
[1:43:53] <reonome> nah just read the lore
[1:43:53] <AMUSERNAME> Ehhhh
[1:43:53] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Nah, just read
[1:43:53] <T_Sasquatch> Use brain
[1:43:53] <xnashamin> nope
[1:43:54] <+AntithesisEK> not really
[1:43:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> No just pay attention
[1:43:54] <%Tearonex> no
[1:43:54] <+Ataraxis9> no
[1:43:54] <+scrumbotime> Turn around and go to the mic!
[1:43:54] <Klonoa__> If you read all the background stuff on skills you can get it
[1:43:54] <Louie_Salmon> No
[1:43:55] <$dalmek> not really
[1:43:55] <Vashido22> not really
[1:43:55] <%CJett92> No, its all built on just messing with everything
[1:43:55] <veemaih> nah
[1:43:56] <Tisaric> nah you'll get it
[1:43:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I didn't yet, but I thought about it
[1:43:57] <%Mendin> It'll be explicitly clear by the end
[1:43:57] <SaltyAzteca> You can if you're a SQUARE
[1:43:57] <iosephe> Depends on you
[1:43:58] <%SirGO0SE> figure things out yourself
[1:43:58] <+oda_flobunaga> mechanics or story?
[1:44:00] <%Dualities> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:44:00] <%luftraumm1> depends on how deep you want to go
[1:44:00] <penitentpentwitch> The lore? Not really. The implied story is pretty heavyhanded.
[1:44:00] <%iamnolionheart> You don't have to optimize until like, NG+ stuff
[1:44:01] <+Toblo1> Sorta but not really.
[1:44:01] <JaseAdrift> NO
[1:44:02] <T_Sasquatch> READ PATRICK READ
[1:44:02] <heartlesshealer> stay AWAY FROM YOUTUBE
[1:44:03] <%D00msDayDan> you get a training room eventually i think
[1:44:03] <RedHotBoss> well.. a little guidace might help with your program combonations
[1:44:04] <+gale_glory1121> Follow the earlier combo advice
[1:44:04] <Daxalog> Do not till its over. Youll get it
[1:44:04] <ape_hawk> Vaati cant help you now!
[1:44:04] <TastySammiches> it comes together at the end
[1:44:04] <namelez1> maybe?
[1:44:05] <%Andrizzleton> No, but you will need to stop relying on crash
[1:44:05] <Tisaric> You're just at the very start
[1:44:05] <not_twitter_rowan> It's pretty clear if you pay attention during the cutscenes @PatStaresAt
[1:44:06] <SomeAsianDood> naw pretty straight forwards
[1:44:06] <UndeadManatee> it will make sense by the end
[1:44:06] <%CJett92> Oh you mean the lore? Maybe
[1:44:08] <%Garthunox> no theres a training room soon
[1:44:08] <+lordericter> understand what? the plot no the mechanics, it seems like it from that fight.
[1:44:09] <%angel949> I mean if you dumb yeah
[1:44:09] <xnashamin> it'll get clearer
[1:44:10] <aeonicvector> optimally? for sure To clear? nah just read skills and figure out efficency
[1:44:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you pay attention to video game, video game explains itself.
[1:44:11] <%frumpsdumpy> it clears itself up
[1:44:11] <Dragon_Batman> You can just experiment
[1:44:12] <%superc37> @patstaresat FUn fact about sybils fight! at the begin, youll notice that it says she was 97% processed. by the time you get her crawling and kill her, shes at her literally last 3 percent of her overall health.
[1:44:13] <veemaih> experiment
[1:44:13] <%MelBrooksKA> @lol_red_ranger It was the only attack he had at the end of the fight
[1:44:14] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Makes more sense on the second playthrough
[1:44:15] <Tisaric> 1 more access point
[1:44:15] <SaltyAzteca> Temporarily
[1:44:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> get to save point
[1:44:16] <%YakumoYomi> Gone for now
[1:44:16] <+sixcubit> no, you're doing great
[1:44:17] <%CJett92> They regen over a few battles
[1:44:17] <+loukemia83> They come back after a bit
[1:44:17] <$dalmek> 1 more access point
[1:44:17] <rafaelba93> maybe finish it twice
[1:44:17] <%iamnolionheart> It's pretty face value
[1:44:17] <Klonoa__> Read the skill backgrounds and such and you'll get it
[1:44:18] <%SirGO0SE> ya thats the worst part of this game imo
[1:44:19] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> in terms of gameplay or story?
[1:44:19] <+oda_flobunaga> for a bit
[1:44:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt ehhh it unfolds but like bastian it has the Vegue name of thing for a bit
[1:44:20] <dukenux> they regen
[1:44:20] <AMUSERNAME> TEMP gone
[1:44:21] <JaseAdrift> it story is pretty clear so far
[1:44:22] <xnashamin> for at least one more save point
[1:44:22] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt they heal after 2 access peoints
[1:44:22] <RedHotBoss> they repair at access points
[1:44:22] <%frumpsdumpy> they come back as you play
[1:44:23] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> play good or lose moves
[1:44:23] <+Toblo1> @PatStaresAt They take at least 2 access points to recharge.
[1:44:23] <%Garthunox> for now
[1:44:24] <critfumble_> fully? maybe. enough? no not really
[1:44:25] <reonome> go to a save point
[1:44:25] <Gutsandlove> they come back
[1:44:28] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt they come back with the access points
[1:44:28] <PanicSwytch> Im not even paying much attention and I know whats happening
[1:44:28] <Dragon_Batman> under the name
[1:44:29] <+pectusumbra> you have to hit one more access point
[1:44:29] <OperatorJo_> temporarily Pat
[1:44:31] <veemaih> they come back
[1:44:32] <heartlesshealer> Find more access points to repair
[1:44:32] <penitentpentwitch> You get abilities back after a certain number of battles.
[1:44:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> get to Access Points to fix
[1:44:36] <%shruke> gotta learn how to play without em for awhile
[1:44:36] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> when you reach those checkpoints they'll be back
[1:44:36] <Rhinoprotoss> Gon foevar
[1:44:39] <%AzureGale> Time 2 equip new functions

[1:44:53] <+StooEsq> "I love people!" Okay.
[1:44:53] <%AzureGale> Shady's back. Tell a friend.
[1:44:56] <Garry_Guyface> Not really just read, but the 45 minute video talking about the plot and music details are great
[1:44:59] <heartlesshealer> Charming Friend?
[1:45:09] <Daxalog> Spark and basic is p good
[1:45:10] <AMUSERNAME> Jaunt + Spark is a cool combo
[1:45:13] <%CJett92> Losing your abilities in battle forces you to experiment with abilities you might not use otherwise. Game design!!
[1:45:15] <%nmaten> 200% max hp
[1:45:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @namelez1 So you're saying you actually need to pay attention to understand? LUL
[1:45:22] <+pectusumbra> cyber dog!
[1:45:22] <Daxalog> Spark is a good upgrader
[1:45:24] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> the plot of this game is *probably* clearer the Dark Souls

[1:46:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> If bork, then do busted, done
[1:46:37] <ulcaban> Red's real power is cuasing vehicles in usable condition to manifest in convienient spots
[1:46:44] <%DensityD> Rucks
[1:46:52] <jfp4life> Pretty sure Crash makes follow-up attacks other than Crash stronger
[1:46:53] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> the Camerata is such a cool antagonist team
[1:46:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ulcaban then breaking them
[1:47:03] <dukenux> They say Camerata, but i can't stop hearing "Camarilla"
[1:47:11] <%topendbuzza> SourPls
[1:47:11] <Tisaric> yeah crash makes combos insane
[1:47:17] <Garry_Guyface> Time to hunt down Count Olaf
[1:47:18] <not_twitter_rowan> @PatStaresAt just remember that part of the plot is that Red and Mr. Nobody themselves don't know what the fuck is going on
[1:47:18] <%DensityD> fidget spinner = dick?
[1:47:19] <Vashido22> I forgot, does Darren voice any character in this game too?
[1:47:22] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[1:47:23] <dukenux> right?
[1:47:24] <+Tomschiii> even tho the voice is somewhat the Same as rucks, its still so different. Just great
[1:47:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'll eat my shoe if SuperGiant doesn't know what Vampire: The Masquerade is.
[1:47:30] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @dukenux they're secret vampires?
[1:47:30] <ShichiNoBushi> "Kamurocho"?

[1:47:41] <+pectusumbra> Now this is around where I stopped myself
[1:47:44] <%iamnolionheart> Darren might voice a spoiler character?
[1:47:48] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @ShichiNoBushi The Dragon of Cloudbank!
[1:47:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Tomschiii He dialed back just enough on the gravel and added a little more breathiness.
[1:47:57] <%superc37> do not forget doggo
[1:47:57] <dukenux> @TallGuyWithAHoodie more like they're this shadow organization or sth like that
[1:48:08] <TastySammiches> TTours
[1:48:10] <%superc37> @iamnolionheart nah he doesnt voice anyone in this game
[1:48:11] <%iamnolionheart> Nope Sunkrish Bala
[1:48:14] <namelez1> they have understandable motives, if werid methods
[1:48:15] <Tisaric> I don't think Darren does a voice in Transistor
[1:48:15] <%AzureGale> It's an interface screw
[1:48:16] <TastySammiches> TTours say fuzzy pickles

[1:53:34] <InfinitySaiyan> YOU FELL FOR IT, THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK
[1:53:34] <not_twitter_rowan> @aeonicvector best combat is Bastion idk what you're on about
[1:53:35] <Tisaric> I'm on the Transistor best combat train myself but Hades is close as shit
[1:53:36] <+LandOfTheWay> time to git gud pat
[1:53:37] <penitentpentwitch> Honestly, they're great practice, which I appreciate in challenge rooms
[1:53:40] <%angel949> It shows you their projected health after each hit
[1:53:41] <ulcaban> disregard missions, acquire cells
[1:53:51] <dukenux> im fed up with this process
[1:54:02] <+Tomschiii> @someasiandood they all look so weird
[1:54:04] <+NitronStreams> how can this be
[1:54:08] <DianaTheAscian> was underhive wars any good? @PatStaresAt
[1:54:10] <%luftraumm1> these challenges are great teaching moments for the mechanics of the game
[1:54:17] <ulcaban> I don't like the process, it's coarse and gets everywhere
[1:54:18] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @not_twitter_rowan I actually agree with that. There are dozens of us!
[1:54:21] <%CJett92> s p e e d
[1:54:44] <SomeAsianDood> I think the one of zag and the boy look pretty good @Tomschiii most likely because I can imagine them smiling
[1:54:44] <not_twitter_rowan> @TallGuyWithAHoodie Machete Carbine gang?
[1:54:52] <%CJett92> moving in turn is a helluva lot faster than wallking out of turn
[1:54:53] <+Tomschiii> Combat has a bad flow, feels clunky and the loop itself is annoying
[1:54:56] <namelez1> bad cells dont drop cells
[1:54:56] <%angel949> 1st try
[1:54:58] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[1:55:06] <Dragon_Batman> Good jerb
[1:55:08] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @not_twitter_rowan Machete gang, at least! I swap out my secondary a lot.
[1:55:11] <namelez1> so you just gotta kill them
[1:55:15] <T_Sasquatch> @tomschiii i think you're just bad
[1:55:15] <%superc37> @tomschiii im guess youre not using turn?

[1:56:25] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> I disliked Transistor's mix of real-time / turn-based combat. Would've rather fully one or the other.

[1:57:36] <snakemuho> will grind to make the game easier, but won't make the game harder to ease the grind
[1:57:37] <%luftraumm1> also that first limiter is fine
[1:57:40] <%topendbuzza> gives more exp
[1:57:40] <%CJett92> They all give bonus XP
[1:57:41] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Admittedly the rewards for Limiters in Transistor are probably the least interesting
[1:57:41] <not_twitter_rowan> Bonus EXP

[1:57:47] <%iamnolionheart> Limiters make the game harder but give more XP
[1:57:48] <DiscoNinjaWolf> Makes game a little harder but more exp
[1:57:50] <%luftraumm1> i think you only have the first
[1:57:50] <penitentpentwitch> It increases exp gain, it's listed in 'effects when in use'
[1:57:50] <RedHotBoss> limiters are limits you can place on yourself for big xps
[1:57:51] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Bonus XP from Limiters
[1:57:51] <Klonoa__> makes game harder but you level faster, that's all

[1:57:55] <Daxalog> Each gives more EXP. And Enemy Lore
[1:57:55] <critfumble_> you get process lore and an xp boost for turning on limiters
[1:57:55] <xnashamin> harder enemies for more exp
[1:57:56] <%Mendin> They're the Gods from Bastion or the Pact from H ades
[1:57:57] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Make game hard for more XP

[1:58:17] <+Javaa01> Also inspect it
[1:58:18] <namelez1> maybe a about 2-3 levels over the cource of the game
[1:58:19] <Tisaric> you can always turn them off but yeah it's up to you

[1:58:38] <user_naim> Also lore

[1:58:53] <Daxalog> Youll see
[1:58:53] <snakemuho> you have to hit them once to absorb @PatStaresAt
[1:58:53] <+mikesapartment> it sucks
[1:58:54] <%CJett92> The dropped cells will have a shield youll need to break before collecting them
[1:58:54] <Saltmeisterr> they take one more hit pat
[1:58:55] <Louie_Salmon> The cells you have to pick up will have shields
[1:58:55] <RedHotBoss> just tthe cells that drop have an oversheild
[1:58:56] <%angel949> The cells you collect will have shields
[1:58:56] <reonome> its... pretty obvious isn't it?

[1:59:02] <Vashido22> chat did I miss the pizza?
[1:59:03] <%luftraumm1> cells that fall from defeated enemies can't be picked up immediately
[1:59:03] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @PatStaresAt the cells you pick up will need to be hit once before pickup
[1:59:05] <%superc37> @patstaresat it means youll have to hit the cells to collect them aft you kill a process
[1:59:07] <dukenux> the cells you collect, youll have to hit em first now @PatStaresAt
[1:59:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's your first time, you shouldn't care about limiters

[2:00:23] <$invisi_bliss> it sure does
[2:00:26] <Dragon_Batman> He ordered the pizza
[2:00:35] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Now you're playing with portals
[2:00:37] <RedHotBoss> turn that one off if you want Pat. there are better limiters coming up
[2:00:43] <%CJett92> He ordered the pizza, hasnt eaten it yet tho
[2:00:44] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> ...wait
[2:00:49] <namelez1> btw in NG+ you can get duplicates of functions so you have breach in your breach
[2:01:03] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @namelez1 yo dog
[2:01:05] <penitentpentwitch> Charm is good as a utility ability, it draws fire and causes damage between enemies. Bad against single foes though.
[2:01:11] <Tisaric> oh shit I never got far enough in NG+ for that that's hilarious
[2:01:19] <+pectusumbra> oh, interesting
[2:01:24] <+mythmonster2> pretty sure breach spam is just how i won
[2:01:31] <+mythmonster2> red smash
[2:01:33] <+Javaa01> Now check the terminal
[2:01:35] <%CJett92> Turn off limiters if you want, there are better ones later on
[2:01:36] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> then turn it off I guess.
[2:01:37] <Klonoa__> then turn it off, its not a big deal
[2:01:40] <Finchit> when they stack it does
[2:01:42] <Tisaric> the game's honestly pretty easy so breach spam is fine
[2:01:44] <Daxalog> Its good to try each imiter once
[2:01:46] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> honestly chat's right this one kinda sucks
[2:01:47] <beetus_unlimited> Did anybody see if he said anything about streaming the new DBD killer?
[2:01:47] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> paige
[2:01:48] <Dragon_Batman> You can take it off, no biggie
[2:01:49] <Finchit> but yeha go ahead and turn it off
[2:01:50] <Tisaric> it's self imposed difficutly
[2:01:50] <penitentpentwitch> Limiter Lore unlocked
[2:01:51] <%angel949> Hi paige 👋!
[2:01:58] <RedHotBoss> quick hum while paige is in the room!
[2:02:05] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Royce is a precious nerd child who must be protected
[2:02:12] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah. I guess you get free lore for trying them at least
[2:02:16] <penitentpentwitch> Hi Royce~
[2:02:19] <+Javaa01> And now if you want, you can turn it off
[2:02:21] <not_twitter_rowan> Royce

[2:02:34] <%topendbuzza> yep
[2:02:36] <snakemuho> limiters are enemy lore btw
[2:02:37] <Tisaric> yeah only 1 lore
[2:02:37] <not_twitter_rowan> Royce is such a little shit I love him so much
[2:02:41] <%iamnolionheart> Yeah
[2:02:42] <xnashamin> end of file
[2:02:46] <namelez1> royce lore dump
[2:02:48] <RedHotBoss> I think so. just try them all once
[2:02:49] <+pectusumbra> it does say end of file
[2:03:04] <%topendbuzza> see loved Red
[2:03:07] <VritraReiRei> I'm late, has Pat finished this game before?
[2:03:08] <%topendbuzza> she*
[2:03:08] <lol_red_ranger> up an coming autists he almost said it
[2:03:11] <%CJett92> Lesbibans KappaPride
[2:03:12] <Tisaric> man Sybil is both sad and creepy in that stalker way
[2:03:12] <AMUSERNAME> "I love people!"
[2:03:14] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Sybil "Thirsty AF" Reisz
[2:03:17] <T_Sasquatch> Big gay
[2:03:17] <%AzureGale> Oh, a yandere
[2:03:20] <not_twitter_rowan> Jealous stalker bitch decided to kill Red's boyfriend
[2:03:21] <reonome> fuck you sybil
[2:03:22] <%iamnolionheart> She's in lesbians
[2:03:22] <Vashido22> Her only crime was being horny
[2:03:22] <%angel949> bishy bishy
[2:03:26] <RedHotBoss> @VritraReiRei nope
[2:03:28] <BlueLunecy> Simp
[2:03:29] <penitentpentwitch> Romeo and Juliet, except the third wheel wants to kill Romeo to bang Juliet
[2:03:39] <namelez1> its mostly sybils fault
[2:03:41] <not_twitter_rowan> @Vashido22 horny enough to kill
[2:03:41] <%FacetiousAF> how romantic Kappa
[2:03:43] <%CJett92> @Vashido22 The punishment is death
[2:03:46] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @AzureGale Not only is she a Yandere, her obsession technically kinda causes the entire plot of the game!
[2:03:58] <%cvp5127> go to horny jail
[2:04:13] <not_twitter_rowan> Transistor is 120% Sybil's fault for being a horny bitch who can't take no for an answer
[2:04:14] <%angel949> kill fast
[2:04:14] <+pectusumbra> operator!
[2:04:24] <%topendbuzza> boss box
[2:04:26] <xnashamin> kill the operator first pat
[2:04:58] <namelez1> though honestly if sybil fidnt do it, the camerata would have succeeded
[2:05:07] <+pectusumbra> okay, at the least it has a set number of spawns
[2:05:10] <penitentpentwitch> Switch() is one of my favorite abilities, but you do have to get used to using it
[2:05:11] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> ...true
[2:05:17] <Frostydough1> Jeez guys we get it Sybil started the problems, how about let the game say it instead
[2:05:22] <%iamnolionheart> Sybil is guilty of being a massive simp
[2:05:44] <reonome> tbf who wouldn't simp for red
[2:05:58] <%angel949> chicken
[2:06:06] <dukenux> D:
[2:06:09] <Dragon_Batman> That one guy simped so hard he died
[2:06:09] <namelez1> i simp for sword
[2:06:10] <penitentpentwitch> Red likes her privacy
[2:06:11] <Louie_Salmon> woah
[2:06:12] <OperatorJo_> Rude
[2:06:13] <$dalmek> the only thing Sybil is guilty of is using jank autotune to sing her bootleg copy of In Circles
[2:06:14] <SomeAsianDood> Wtf pat
[2:06:15] <%iamnolionheart> Egg
[2:06:17] <SaltyAzteca> GRENAAAAAAADE
[2:06:21] <+titansloth93> Just started trying this game again, Supergiant sure loves them some disembodied commentary
[2:06:26] <RedHotBoss> you ruined the peace talks pat
[2:06:27] <%laserbeaming> cuckers

[2:06:31] <Tisaric> we had peckers last game now it's cluckers LUL
[2:06:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> areeeeees
[2:06:31] <%superc37> mortars.

[2:07:02] <RedPlasticCup> pat stares at
[2:07:05] <+oda_flobunaga> all the music is diagetic
[2:07:05] <namelez1> in turn planning? yep
[2:07:06] <penitentpentwitch> Rebel Up
[2:07:07] <Tisaric> the planning phase is meant to be inside her head
[2:07:08] <SaltyAzteca> LOAD
[2:07:09] <%DensityD> NUMBER GO UP AGAIN
[2:07:09] <%topendbuzza> love load
[2:07:10] <%angel949> @iamnolionheart watch yo profanity
[2:07:13] <SaltyAzteca> BIG EXPLOSION
[2:07:13] <%iamnolionheart> Both strong options
[2:07:14] <%AzureGale> Here I go again on my own
[2:07:17] <penitentpentwitch> Passive Slots!
[2:07:17] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> PASSIVE SLOT YES
[2:07:18] <Tisaric> so you hear her voice humming in her head as well
[2:07:20] <%DensityD> a FAT LOAD
[2:07:29] <%CJett92> Aww yiss time for the accordian!
[2:07:37] <not_twitter_rowan> Passive slot
[2:07:40] <OperatorJo_> burst L O A D
[2:07:41] <not_twitter_rowan> time for final lore
[2:07:43] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> good accordian
[2:07:44] <%AzureGale> THis music is a banger
[2:07:47] <penitentpentwitch> Streets will be packed... with Process
[2:07:51] <namelez1> never enough memory
[2:07:54] <superbla25> does pat thing tumors are white boxes?
[2:07:56] <+titansloth93> EXP IN ABUNDANCE
[2:08:17] <Tisaric> oh he's getting it
[2:08:18] <namelez1> even in NG+
[2:08:24] <dukenux> hes learning
[2:08:25] <Tisaric> I love when turns come together like that
[2:08:27] <+lordericter> Pat seriously please jaunt in the stopped time
[2:08:33] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Now you're thinking with Transistors
[2:08:38] <penitentpentwitch> For an easy trick, use Charm on Weeds to heal mid-combat
[2:08:46] <Dragon_Batman> cuz goblins
[2:08:46] <Klonoa__> its fiiiine
[2:08:46] <%l3sovikk> takes less to move with Jaunt
[2:08:47] <Tisaric> it's so much more effective than walking
[2:08:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> toki wo tomatoes
[2:08:48] <%angel949> he's learning guys
[2:08:49] <$Dakuu75> -because ppl are babies
[2:08:49] <Louie_Salmon> It good
[2:08:51] <%nmaten> just look at how much less ap it takes
[2:08:51] <%angel949> chill
[2:08:51] <%Daniel_Is_I> Because it's UNOPTIMAL
[2:08:52] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> BECAUSE IT'S SUB OPTIMAL PAT
[2:08:53] <snakemuho> you waste stopped time by walking @PatStaresAt
[2:08:54] <SaltyAzteca> BIG SPLOSION
[2:09:00] <%superc37> cuz youre wasting a toooooon of meter
[2:09:01] <%laserbeaming> I like load()
[2:09:03] <+scrumbotime> Big Loads
[2:09:04] <OperatorJo_> crashing through the whole game
[2:09:05] <+pectusumbra> Because N u m b e r
[2:09:06] <reonome> because minmaxing
[2:09:06] <RedHotBoss> walk in stop time=less attack
[2:09:07] <%SaiyanShoto> You do you Pat
[2:09:07] <+oda_flobunaga> Damn it, let Pat be as inefficient as he wants to be
[2:09:14] <%angel949> huge load
[2:09:15] <namelez1> you need ping
[2:09:18] <%topendbuzza> you have a passive slot now
[2:09:19] <Tisaric> you have to hit it with something else
[2:09:23] <+Javaa01> Make explosive barrels
[2:09:24] <dukenux> a bomb
[2:09:34] <%laserbeaming> you need to hit them
[2:09:38] <veemaih> BECOME PARASOL
[2:09:38] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt yeah you also have a passive slot on the very left now too
[2:09:39] <dukenux> i didn't really like load as an active funtcion
[2:09:42] <%CJett92> places explosive barrels, you still gotta pop them yourself
[2:09:43] <Dragon_Batman> cluster might be good
[2:09:43] <+lordericter> It feels like when you walk instead of jaunting that you are shouting You don't pay my sub, right to my face
[2:09:43] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Pat's gonna be so glad when he gets Cull
[2:09:45] <namelez1> ping in passive is actually pretty nice
[2:09:46] <reonome> put something in your passive pat
[2:09:51] <RedHotBoss> yea i also walked alot. only jaunted to dodge and had no troubles
[2:10:12] <SaltyAzteca> Put Sybil in passive for Goddess attack
[2:10:15] <+titansloth93> jaunt plus bombs is really fun
[2:10:21] <namelez1> SUPERUSER
[2:10:21] <Tisaric> Kill()
[2:10:23] <%topendbuzza> kill is great
[2:10:27] <Tisaric> I fucking love the function names
[2:10:30] <penitentpentwitch> Passives are nice in this game
[2:10:31] <Klonoa__> superuser is pretty cool tbh
[2:10:32] <+pectusumbra> I don't understand that one
[2:10:33] <%iamnolionheart> SUPER

[2:11:50] <Dragon_Batman> need more power
[2:11:53] <%iamnolionheart> I would ditch the charm for now maybe?
[2:11:56] <Louie_Salmon> You know, you'd get more RAM if you leveled faster with limiters...
[2:12:06] <RedHotBoss> if only there was a way to increase your levels faster. thus creating more memory... if only
[2:12:06] <+Javaa01> No, not back here

[2:13:31] <+Javaa01> Guess Californians voted for the Burned Sky
[2:13:32] <%MelBrooksKA> Is Paige even here?
[2:13:40] <%luftraumm1> have you talked about yesterday's fever dream already?
[2:13:48] <Tisaric> god this music never gets old
[2:13:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I'd never name a pet arnj because what kind of silly pet name songs can you make with a word that can't be rhymed?!
[2:14:00] <+KevinsLunchbox> I just showed up and Pat looks unhappy
[2:14:00] <%angel949> Paige is taking care of baby
[2:14:01] <Tisaric> yeah load's hard to use
[2:14:07] <%CJett92> Ya, Load's not a great active
[2:14:08] <eldritchmouse> Load is pretty hard to use
[2:14:08] <%nmaten> plant and explode it in stopped time
[2:14:09] <%topendbuzza> nah you just suck pat
[2:14:09] <penitentpentwitch> Load is okay as a passive and an upgrade
[2:14:13] <%iamnolionheart> Load works better as a passive I think
[2:14:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt its better as a support mod
[2:14:19] <$dalmek> it's generally best to just smack it immediately in Turn()
[2:14:21] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt Load's batter as a support
[2:14:21] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Load is better with more functions, by itself its very cumbersome
[2:14:28] <+NitronStreams> yesterday never happened
[2:14:28] <Klonoa__> its okay for breach crash->load->breach but yeah, better for support
[2:14:29] <Manwad> load's good against like 3 enemies and that's it
[2:14:36] <auraofdawn> yeah its hit or miss
[2:14:37] <namelez1> loads a good upgrade
[2:14:38] <popcultureaficionado> yeah get rid of that garbo
[2:14:40] <+StooEsq> what a load
[2:14:41] <dukenux> syes, load is one of those go to passive ones
[2:14:48] <%topendbuzza> no super turn yet
[2:14:49] <dukenux> too much hassle with active
[2:15:13] <+KevinsLunchbox> lol
[2:15:15] <Tisaric> him putting charm on every time is screwing it so much LUL
[2:15:17] <lol_red_ranger> classic
[2:15:18] <penitentpentwitch> All hail Emergency Turn
[2:15:22] <OperatorJo_> EGGED
[2:15:25] <Vashido22> nice dodge pat

[2:16:48] <dinnydanny777> Tracer Feet?

[2:16:48] <superbla25> yes
[2:16:49] <Tisaric> yeah you have to see it
[2:16:54] <$dalmek> at least until it procs once
[2:16:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> Opening Theme for the Dragon's Dogma show is up on twitter Pat
[2:16:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> Keep it until you see superuser
