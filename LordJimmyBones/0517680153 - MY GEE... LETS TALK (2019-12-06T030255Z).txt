[0:41:43] <+noalias16> @vatoheem rofl
[0:41:43] <+saint_cola> "Don't worry man when I get my next check"
[0:41:45] <JBeezYBabY1> I figured
[0:41:47] <@ayoitsdave> Kappa
[0:41:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> he's but a messenger/socmed for the most part
[0:41:49] <jejemokof> Hey Geoff Heyy
[0:41:55] <+bigbatesss> this is wild lol
[0:41:55] <@SpryteMix> was it ever this messed up with KoF 14?
[0:41:56] <+saint_cola> SNK really hit you with the "lol im broke dog"
[0:42:01] <+StoneColdJacko> Kreygasm
[0:42:03] <Errd0r> Probaly the executive decisions
[0:42:03] <JBeezYBabY1> @jejemokof Hey gurl hey!
[0:42:05] <@Mighty_observer> "Bruh, when i get my taxes"
[0:42:10] <TheKnightMask> if they try to pay you with Western Union, that'd be some real bs
[0:42:12] <Errd0r> *Probably
[0:42:16] <%ArooLee> it's definitely incompetence from the leadership
[0:42:24] <%ArooLee> the dude running the tour is getting 0 support
[0:42:41] <jejemokof> Heeey JBeezzzzyyy @jbeezybaby1
[0:42:44] <%andyocr> We got 30k for evo

[0:44:01] <JBeezYBabY1> @njmarcopolo Good idea
[0:44:01] <+StoneColdJacko> darksySTAR
[0:44:02] <+noalias16> This is hilarious rofl
[0:44:06] <ElkyDori> Flying 17 hours past the IDL is basically 2 days in travel.
[0:44:07] <@Mighty_observer> @ayoitsdave that can be argued against
[0:44:07] <@SpryteMix> Still waiting on my Metal Slug 8 SwiftRage
[0:44:13] <+saint_cola> This is painful
[0:44:19] <@GeoffTheHero> yeah you'd have to be flying out by now
[0:44:25] <+NJMarcoPolo> @jbeezybaby1 I’m not happy with how they treated him or other players. That is foul
[0:44:31] <@Mighty_observer> @SpryteMix Snk only makes fighting games now spryte, give up
[0:44:36] <JBeezYBabY1> awwww bruh
[0:44:36] <hulkjen> @aroolee naaawww you asian too. It’s the Asian empty gesture. We pissed China out there buying up qualifiers so they tried to appease the scene with “hey! We want you here too!” Invitation
[0:44:38] <misterkeebler> @NerdJosh who has the Shannon Sharpe emote? lol
[0:44:38] <romansrk> Fatal Fury 3 Kappa
[0:44:42] <+omagoma561> The planning on all of this... sushiEw sushiEw
[0:44:47] <+saint_cola> Where's the bootlickin' now
[0:44:49] <+NJMarcoPolo> I’m willing to fly jimmy out to an event if needed
[0:44:55] <+NJMarcoPolo> Bc that shit isn’t right
[0:44:55] <hulkjen> This is not a management issue
[0:44:56] <JBeezYBabY1> @njmarcopolo Of course. We all are
[0:44:59] <jejemokof> you mean you can't pull $1000 out your pocket in the middle of the holidays?? lol
[0:45:00] <%andyocr> chenGasm
[0:45:02] <@SpryteMix> bootlickin???
[0:45:06] <@ayoitsdave> does gunsmith still think everythings honkeydorey
[0:45:07] <%ArooLee> oh yeah the RR qualifier spot was definitely an empty gesture
[0:45:13] <romansrk> wait fuck
[0:45:21] <Vatoheem> Marco come to our room
[0:45:25] <+NJMarcoPolo> Gunsmith can lick a donkey ass
[0:45:26] <+bigbatesss> this way too rushed.
[0:45:35] <+NJMarcoPolo> I’m getting a haircut now vato
[0:45:41] <%ArooLee> but i'm saying overall the tour is a pile of turds cuz the guy running it has no resources or time
[0:45:45] <+omagoma561> is getting a visa within that short time frame even possible?!?!?!
[0:45:57] <CrackPr0nFR> omagoma561 : realistically, no
[0:45:59] <@Toshin> PopCorn
[0:45:59] <@SpryteMix> it'll be very expensive
[0:46:01] <@Toshin> HS18WOW
[0:46:07] <+NJMarcoPolo> Yes but in extreme and I mean extreme circumstances
[0:46:16] <+NJMarcoPolo> But for a tournament? No it’s impossible
[0:46:19] <CrackPr0nFR> unless you have a lawyer that knows what they're doing and you have a VERY important reason
[0:46:21] <CurlyW> so fun fact: One year, SNK wanted to put up a pot bonus for KoF14 at CB, but they expected *us* to pay the players the pot bonus, and then SNK would pay us later
[0:46:21] <%arsenemc> wtf are they doing
[0:46:21] <jejemokof> We need mircles
[0:46:22] <+angelapickles> sigh. This breaks my heart
[0:46:23] <%Guzman_____> Plus $300 for Wechat lordji1Grin
[0:46:30] <%ArooLee> LOL
[0:46:31] <misterkeebler> all this with your new job sounds like a crazy hassle
[0:46:33] <%ArooLee> holy shit
[0:46:34] <CurlyW> and no tournament with a pot bonus works like that
[0:46:36] <+NJMarcoPolo> Rofl
[0:46:38] <@Mighty_observer> $300 or you can hit ya boy on the corner for a cool $50
[0:46:39] <@SpryteMix> damn, KoF 14 too??
[0:46:41] <@SpryteMix> man....
[0:46:42] <+NJMarcoPolo> I’m dying. You kidding me fam

[0:55:21] <+StoneColdJacko> ElkyDori and time sounds like a music band
[0:55:22] <+InvestigationCone> My main disappointment is we are not going to know who the F the mystery invite-only China players are? I was hoping our Ronin Agent would bring back some intel.
[0:55:22] <%ArooLee> and thought they were doing a good thing
[0:55:25] <hulkjen> @geoffthehero It really wasn’t your fault!
[0:55:32] <+NJMarcoPolo> Sorry god :v
[0:55:37] <+NJMarcoPolo> Thanks curly
[0:55:37] <+JohnXuandou> Geoff it's not on you, SNK messed this us
[0:55:38] <+StoneColdJacko> lol
[0:55:39] <%ArooLee> geoff shut up it's not your fucking fault
[0:55:39] <+JohnXuandou> up
[0:55:40] <%ScrubSaibot> SNK only did the letting down not you @GeoffTheHero
[0:55:42] <superdoodguy> Not your fault Geoff
[0:55:47] <superdoodguy> Don't
[0:55:50] <romansrk> Geoff its not you, its SNK
[0:55:51] <+saint_cola> Don't start that shit Geoff
[0:55:52] <dweebenheimer20> and you want to be my latex salesman Kappa
[0:56:03] <JBeezYBabY1> Geoff nooooo its not your fault at all
[0:56:06] <+JohnXuandou> like it all falls on SNK for not actually planning this or supporting people or having some sort of structure to this
[0:56:06] <NY_JDash> Good to see you in the chat, @NJMarcoPolo.
[0:56:08] <+MissingPersonSRK> Don't fall on your sword @GeoffTheHero, this isn't your fault. That's why we were calling out SNK
[0:56:11] <+NJMarcoPolo> @geoffthehero stop there. You did what you could
[0:56:17] <+noalias16> Dude, Geoff did not do anything. He built the product, SNK wanted to used it, and they dropped the ball.
[0:56:17] <jejemokof> @geoffthehero don't be hard on yourself.. your intentions were pure
[0:56:17] <+MissingPersonSRK> Mexico would've been hella fucked
[0:56:19] <clorox_pr> that's stupid one week before
[0:56:20] <+noalias16> Tremendously
[0:56:22] <hulkjen> SNK was out to get us. It’s not your fault @geoffthehero
[0:56:25] <+NJMarcoPolo> It’s not your or anyone’s fault. It’s snk fault
[0:56:26] <%EightFootOctopus> I'm gonna be a contrarian and blame Geoff HahaDoge
[0:56:30] <dweebenheimer20> Mexico got 0 spots alkFax
[0:56:31] <@GeoffTheHero> it was still negligent
[0:56:32] <+NJMarcoPolo> Hey @ny_jdash
[0:56:35] <@GeoffTheHero> thanks all <3
[0:56:37] <%EightFootOctopus> It isn't your fault though lol
[0:56:37] <CrackPr0nFR> lol
[0:56:37] <+NJMarcoPolo> I’m good
[0:56:44] <%ArooLee> you know what's negligent bro?
[0:56:45] <CrackPr0nFR> that's actually wrong
[0:56:46] <JBeezYBabY1> @geoffthehero but not on your part
[0:56:49] <CrackPr0nFR> it's quite a bit his fault
[0:56:49] <+bigbatesss> This is definitely not Geoff fault. SNK IS TRIPPIN
[0:56:50] <+NJMarcoPolo> Just pissed about snk
[0:56:51] <%ArooLee> the entire fucking SWC
[0:56:52] <hulkjen> @geoffthehero it’s not. You immediately contacted SNK
[0:56:55] <@Mighty_observer> yeah, like did they expect someone could get a visa and then plan a flight and get a hotal in 4 days?
[0:56:55] <NY_JDash> No fault on your end, Geoff. None at all.
[0:56:58] <hulkjen> to sort out details
[0:57:01] <romansrk> Don't blame yourself because of this, SNK clearly messed up.
[0:57:04] <+noalias16> They just ain’t support. That’s it.
[0:57:07] <CrackPr0nFR> N'ah
[0:57:09] <NY_JDash> And yeah, Marco. This is some messed up crap.
[0:57:12] <+noalias16> Leave it there.
[0:57:14] <+MissingPersonSRK> Geoff definitely did due diligence
[0:57:14] <%Guzman_____> Nah @geoffthehero It’s clear you wanna help out the community in every way
[0:57:14] <hulkjen> You did your due diligence
[0:57:17] <CrackPr0nFR> Hella people brought this up as soon as it was announced
[0:57:24] <+NJMarcoPolo> He’s EC family: I’m tight
[0:57:26] <JBeezYBabY1> @hulkjen AmenT!
[0:57:28] <MechaShinOni> I mean you guys were on a really tight schedule so
[0:57:32] <$Mr_Sujano> @geoffthehero doesn't sound like your fault, man. especially with how other game devs seem to handle it
[0:57:34] <CrackPr0nFR> and it was his tournament. you don't just throw shit out without knowing what is being done/contracts, etc.
[0:57:35] <+NJMarcoPolo> It’s all tamn fault

[1:05:08] <JBeezYBabY1> @geoffthehero LOL
[1:05:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> this is some shit
[1:05:15] <%ScrubSaibot> When I went to Cineplex championships in Toronto they booked the return flight for like an hour after the tournament ended
[1:05:16] <@GeoffTheHero> btw guys thank you
[1:05:18] <jejemokof> 😷
[1:05:18] <@GeoffTheHero> seriously
[1:05:18] <romansrk> >Arrives in China >Gets power geysered seconds after landing
[1:05:23] <@Mighty_observer> SNK: Lose our number
[1:05:23] <%ArooLee> and then SNK slaps 1k back in your bank account, pats you on the back, and tells you "bless up"
[1:05:23] <@ayoitsdave> ft1 single elim is the best way to play samsho
[1:05:27] <+StoneColdJacko> Alpha 3's World Tour Mode is better than this shit
[1:05:27] <$Mr_Sujano> That would be awful. Chances of you even doing well DIRECTLY after a flight like that is next to impossible.
[1:05:28] <MechaShinOni> you good @GeoffTheHero
[1:05:29] <@GeoffTheHero> i promise i'm going to be much more vigilant about this
[1:05:32] <QuincyPwns> im so lost
[1:05:32] <@GeoffTheHero> in the future
[1:05:34] <@SpryteMix> Geoff is a hero
[1:05:35] <CurlyW> so wack lol
[1:05:35] <+MissingPersonSRK> First deflect into SSM: "Fuck China" -- never seen again
[1:05:36] <JBeezYBabY1> @geoffthehero Seriously...fuck you 💋
[1:05:37] <%Revenance_> bless up
[1:05:39] <TheKnightMask> I have a theory. they want to make the brackets go by quickly so that players don't go over the gaming curfew that China's implementing
[1:05:39] <romansrk> @geoffthehero <3
[1:05:40] <jejemokof> trial and error
[1:05:40] <@GeoffTheHero> <3
[1:05:49] <+Reiki_Kito> You did a good job, Geoff
[1:05:49] <MechaShinOni> lets just make some shit up
[1:05:49] <vlastanovak> WAIT. So the China tournament is an 8-person invitational and THREE people qualify!?
[1:05:50] <+angelapickles> honest question
[1:05:51] <QuincyPwns> can we get a quick re briefing
[1:05:51] <glasskyut> well it's china tech Kappa
[1:05:52] <CurlyW> @SpryteMix that's how he got his name: DarkSydeGeoff
[1:05:52] <%ScrubSaibot> Gaming curfew wtf
[1:05:54] <vlastanovak> Lmao
[1:05:55] <MechaShinOni> and run with it

[1:05:57] <%arsenemc> SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin SINGLE ELIM lordji1Grin
[1:05:57] <%ScrubSaibot> Real life Orwell
[1:05:59] <%andyocr> Send me to china
[1:06:00] <+angelapickles> How do other countries run brackets?
[1:06:02] <Vatoheem> I have theory, China is fuckinng with us
[1:06:03] <%andyocr> I got deflects
[1:06:08] <%andyocr> I can play single elimination
[1:06:09] <+angelapickles> Is double elim the standard for all?
[1:06:13] <+StoneColdJacko> I have a theory
[1:06:16] <Putmeinacoma> I’ve been here all along and still can’t follow. I’m only still here for the atpSuspect
[1:06:16] <%cutwest707> ncssToddler
[1:06:17] <+StoneColdJacko> SWC sucks
[1:06:19] <+angelapickles> (Don’t throw rocks at me) I really don’t jnow
[1:06:19] <+InvestigationCone> Total number of spots is 16?
[1:06:22] <TheKnightMask> @vatoheem pretty much
[1:06:23] <hulkjen> @aroolee that was previous evo champ and shilling for the game.
[1:06:25] <+NY_JDash> NY_JDash subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:06:25] <@Moobot> THANKS FOR THE PRIME. MY GEE! WELCOME TO THE GEE-SQUAD
[1:06:26] <+NY_JDash> reward A Sub shared Rewards to 5 others in Chat!
[1:06:26] <%Revenance_> there's no trial and error to have with this. There are multiple successful tour examples from all other japanese companies rn
[1:06:33] <Putmeinacoma> Too much bong water 💦 here
[1:06:35] <%ArooLee> oh that's the samsho 2 evo champ right
[1:06:36] <Errd0r> ARCRevo
[1:06:36] <@ayoitsdave> Thanks for the HahaDoge @ny_jdash
[1:06:42] <+StoneColdJacko> There's literally only 2 more qualifiers in NA
[1:06:43] <MechaShinOni> no one knows what's up
[1:06:45] <@ayoitsdave> HahaDoge
[1:06:47] <glasskyut> so NGWT better than this
[1:06:48] <Errd0r> What else who does this things?
[1:06:48] <CurlyW> you can do single elim if it's a winner-take-all event
[1:06:50] <+AngelFreak4e> @andyocr play like a normal person, please.
[1:06:52] <%ArooLee> dude literally nobody at SNK understands the FGC ecosystem
[1:06:57] <%cutwest707> HahaDoge HahaDoge HahaDoge
[1:06:57] <%ArooLee> it's painfully clear
[1:06:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Revenance_ just to add, this isn't SNK's first attempt at world tour of sorts when they did the KOF invitational thing for XIV
[1:06:58] <Errd0r> Wasn't NGWT a mess last year?
[1:06:59] <CurlyW> or if there's some form of group stage prior
[1:07:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> so yeah Aroo's right
[1:07:06] <%NY_JDash> No problem, @ayoitsdave
[1:07:11] <@ayoitsdave> lmfao
[1:07:12] <CrackPr0nFR> NGWT is not affiliated with SNK
[1:07:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> tbh it comes across as they have no idea how to do this shit
[1:07:16] <%andyocr> @angelfreak4e no mames guey
[1:07:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> NGWT is separate, ye
[1:07:21] <CurlyW> but if you're paying out 2nd place, 3rd place, etc.
[1:07:24] <CrackPr0nFR> that is a completely different group
[1:07:24] <CurlyW> single elim is very bad
[1:07:25] <hulkjen> @aroolee I think so. I closed it. 2017 and 2018
[1:07:26] <Errd0r> Alright alright
[1:07:28] <+AngelFreak4e> lol @andyocr puto.
[1:07:28] <%arsenemc> This is as bad as nintendo lordji1Grin
[1:07:30] <+AngelFreak4e> darksySTAR
[1:07:31] <%ArooLee> gotcha
[1:07:34] <%Spider1991> TENCENT?
[1:07:36] <MechaShinOni> cuz SNK owned by china
[1:07:39] <CurlyW> SamSho with items on

[1:07:43] <jejemokof> @andyocr I didn't know you knew Spanish lol
[1:07:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> Ledo, not Tencent
[1:07:45] <romansrk> Yeah this is worse than Nintendo

[1:14:21] <+MissingPersonSRK> So they were wary to host a tournament near Hong Kong...but Guangzhou is right across the bay from Hong Kong LUL
[1:14:25] <vlastanovak> Wow. So basically Chinese companies paid SNK to give them spots? Awesome.
[1:14:26] <JBeezYBabY1> its getting deep now
[1:14:29] <+StoneColdJacko> Everything is "next Time"
[1:14:34] <%Revenance_> they contracted with China to give them 6 spots before even making the tour
[1:14:36] <+StoneColdJacko> you'd think this was an anime episode
[1:14:37] <%Revenance_> that's fucking crazy
[1:14:38] <CurlyW> somebody who works at Valve gonna go leak this to China now

[1:15:25] <+bigbatesss> so this is just the SWC Chinese tour
[1:15:27] <%ArooLee> they just want to have some fun marketing events for the chinese market
[1:15:28] <CurlyW> god, I'm so fucked up about the SBO reference

[1:15:32] <CurlyW> that's so insane
[1:15:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> i don't think you can like, have an online qualifier with this game's netcode lol
