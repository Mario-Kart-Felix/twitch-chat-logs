[0:23:43] <%Lliimbo> @Ghostfrom3rdstrike_ I've definitely seen plenty of streamers saying it's subpar today
[0:23:44] <+PeterGlagowski> Sega already said the netcode was the same as Final Showdown
[0:23:44] <%culex24> rare monday stream
[0:23:45] <shikimagura> Same shared serverbwith pso2ng to save on server costs????
[0:23:47] <Armandood> also runs on better hardware and now we have better connections?
[0:23:47] <%mrhappytrigers88> I hope this game's matches are stable as possible.
[0:23:49] <Wydken> then It's good to see some kind of improvement to netcode in new ways
[0:23:50] <BreadMakerCTM> most cloud solutions now offer on-the-fly escalation
[0:23:51] <%krypton1cs> Wait rare Monday stream???
[0:23:52] <%Nmaster64> Didn't someone confirm it was Google Cloud servers?

[0:24:25] <%TheIronFro> Literally Sega does what Nintendon't doodStare
[0:24:28] <%el_nino91> What's up doods! Happy Memorial Day!
[0:24:29] <PuddingFighter_> what if someone made a Server-based Rollback implementation? Would it be even better than normal rollback in Theory? @Maximilian_DOOD
[0:24:30] <seaechiowai> as long as it's better than nintendo online, sega exec will be happy
[0:24:30] <yewlz17> Sony servers maybe??
[0:24:33] <%terribilta> aren't servers probably much cheaper now than it was back in vf5 vanilla?
[0:24:34] <yamiryuu2> What if they are just using ps4 servers?
[0:24:35] <%Congragumumlations> I'm more hyped for VF5 than Strive at this point
[0:24:36] <%ULTRA__64> @OmegaZeroX2 Ayeoo doodBro doodBro doodBro
[0:24:36] <+GreetingsMortal> VF vs Tekken incoming
[0:24:37] <alinktothefutur3> Max if you’re playing randos to test the online I live in the Midwest doodGood
[0:24:40] <%kn1ghtsabre> My guess is Sony is supplying the servers, and that's why it's exclusive.
[0:24:42] <%EldestOnion> And their new servers can have fiber optics and shit @Maximilian_DOOD
[0:24:45] <samenoske1> @maximilian_dood hey so what’s going to be the schedule for next week?
[0:24:45] <%Skullshazam13th> 2007. When there’s mvc2 still around. Until….
[0:24:46] <%DinoPulseZeta> Is his theory correct, or is he getting paid to say that?

[0:24:47] <+frozeusgaming> havong so much fun. just hate the ps4 controller and my fight pad is having diagnal issues
[0:24:48] <$StrykirDarque> It came out 2 yrs ago
[0:24:48] <%Congragumumlations> ello mate
[0:24:50] <helacious> its like the steam relay feature in steamworks, its pretty much there to hide the adress  and make it easier to connect
[0:24:50] <shikimagura> possibly sharing servers with ps02ng to save on server costs???
[0:24:51] <bahamut_garuda> damn

[0:42:10] <%rbakervv> @KraftyMattKraft he hasn't even tried yet, most likely will be labbing for rest of the night
[0:42:11] <%Dwang> @PinoMcFly If you own PS Plus, then yes. There's also a bundle with the DLC for $30, but to play online you still need PS Plus so haha

[0:43:36] <elmo_s_friend> Kreygasm
[0:43:38] <helacious> the 3 buttons VF = simple thing is such a lie, yeah theres 3 physical buttons but make no mistake the game uses every button combination + directions, P+K and P+G could be their own buttons
[0:43:40] <seaechiowai> but angel, guytendo and maylee are built to play like 3d fighter
[0:43:40] <%kingeagle23> I say Joe chat
[0:43:43] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> He's from the same group of assassins as Goh iirc PrideRise
[0:43:43] <+losthighwayblues> aurShock aurShock
[0:43:44] <%Dwang> @SonicDolphin117 And it's all 3 buttons, remember doodLUL

[0:43:53] <+Zaph__Kiel> good oki
[0:43:55] <%SquallAdv> @truckdrivingamer yup, animations still super top tier ejsaH ejsaH ejsaH
[0:43:56] <%TheHCSlipEntry> Street Fighter 6 Ken needs chains
[0:43:58] <%megido_flame> figured Max would pick emo Ken to lab on
[0:44:02] <lastdragon01> Bruh this is sick
[0:44:04] <%Jinno9> is this game using the same engine as the new like a dragon? Yakuza
[0:44:06] <+megajay3592> Is this a free PS Plus game or free for anyone with PSN
[0:44:08] <%Krecier> This character has chores you say?
[0:44:11] <%Shuinaa> he is fakhrumram LUL
[0:44:14] <krystalcute91> @brindle_stryker that jean
[0:44:16] <+Owltosser> Never played Jean, but he seems kind of complicated
[0:44:17] <%KraftyMattKraft> The mixup games in VF5 is insane
[0:44:17] <strawhatdvinci> this looks like my type of character
[0:44:18] <$CeeJayOrJustC> Yes
[0:44:20] <TK_TANTO> Like how he does a close correct shuto
[0:44:20] <sleeper_roy> @jinno9 Yes
[0:44:22] <agusper11> Is this gonna be your main @Maximilian_DOOD ?
[0:44:24] <%PFlare> He's all about mixup and fakeouts.
[0:44:26] <ChaosImpact> basically combo string delay
[0:44:27] <stephentheking8> charge moves 👀👀👀
[0:44:29] <%Lliimbo> @Kobukson He's just a memer dont take it too seriously
[0:44:31] <+billy_deez> fake outs
[0:44:31] <dgv88> I wouldn't play this character LUL
[0:44:32] <%Dwang> @Jinno9 Yes, it's using the same engine as used in Yakuza 6, Judgment and Like A Dragon
[0:44:33] <+Ezra51> are there command inputs in this game?
[0:44:34] <%Shimbochin> "ok now ladies?" just to finish maxes alrights
[0:44:36] <Whorror> @Kobukson Because he's a realist. He knows it wont attract people in the longrun. And it's quite stale after a while
[0:44:37] <Brindle_Stryker> evil goth ken delrNom

[0:45:14] <Neoxon> Man, I’m rusty

[0:45:35] <%Kanzuki_> This character is supposed to be the best character in VF5?
[0:45:35] <%AkumaMatataX_X> how hard is it to learn el blaze chat?

[0:45:41] <+DogBomber> @ticksmilk Aris actually was involved with VF at it's peak

[0:45:44] <%Otoshi_Gami> @Maximilian_DOOD Pretty much :)
[0:45:45] <%MechaShadow84> Eileen is definitely beginner friendly.  I use to use her back in 2007.
[0:45:48] <REDLAYTEE> I like his style and character design
[0:45:48] <%PFlare> Also, if this is his theme, it's a banger.
[0:45:49] <BreadMakerCTM> don't ask me LUL
[0:45:49] <%Dwang> @Maximilian_DOOD how do you feel about Goh though? That's another character I don't see much online
[0:45:51] <hujkull> eileem is not for bbeginners
[0:45:51] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> Jean-Luc Cujoh
[0:45:51] <%legendaryheroxx> @real_kdubya she's fun. her stances are deadly
[0:45:52] <+Nocturne_Noble> Lau is easy to learn, then Jacky and Sarah.
[0:45:52] <elementor374> Tiger drop lol
[0:45:53] <%culex24> eileen is basically monke

[0:46:01] <SoupaSaiyajinGod> Hey say Hi to meeeeeee
[0:46:04] <jtk1401> Is it weird that I'm a little arouse with the dummy?
[0:46:06] <%SamuraiPoet88> His charging attacks will leave him open to Counter, A Lot
[0:46:06] <+redjoe1991> is this game harder to learn than tekken @Maximilian_DOOD
[0:46:07] <SilkyMimic> The charge moves look satisfying to hit
[0:46:07] <ez__RAGE> He seems very unpredictable.
[0:46:08] <phlie> @sonicdolphin117 back to KI with yee Kappa
[0:46:08] <Belakitu> NUT PUNCH

[0:46:12] <DNICE3838> thank you sega n sony
[0:46:12] <%LifeAfterFlint> Max Kazama
[0:46:13] <NrgSpoon> seems like the goal is to charge when they're blocking to get followups
[0:46:14] <Nayafer91> the impact on his move, omg!!!
[0:46:15] <littlelinkrocks> Do you think this game is gonna be at Evo online?
[0:46:16] <+Owltosser> and lows too for kicks

[0:46:41] <+Zaph__Kiel> I can see valle playing this guy
[0:46:41] <%Dwang> Chat, I don't recommend thirsting on Dural. They could annihilate you like a snap
[0:46:42] <%Bedskirts> seems like a scrub destroyer
[0:46:42] <seaechiowai> @jtk1401 yes. but actually no
[0:46:43] <LuxSignifer> for how long is this game going to be PS exclusive?
[0:46:45] <elementor374> @darnell16player You mean ps3?
[0:46:45] <Unknownkidx> So Jean weakness is swaying?
[0:46:47] <%KraftyMattKraft> @IsaacBMF Yes. Absolutely.
[0:46:48] <%ungratefulkhuunt> netcode is fulla
[0:46:49] <%memburberry> his built in delays and fakes with charging is really fun
[0:46:50] <bennythejet504> This game is so technical
[0:46:50] <ammobasket> everyone has dangerous basics, just try everyone and stick with the one you vibe with
[0:46:51] <krystalcute91> lol kenny XD
[0:46:53] <$johnrod296> Might have to play VF games now LUL
[0:46:54] <@Belutima> @Vokuro_Imari 1 year doodCake
[0:46:55] <jjyy1234> @redjoe1991 definitely not. Tekken way harder
[0:46:58] <%blitz_1217> charge is gonna be hard to use against all the people just mashing rn lol
[0:47:01] <lastdragon01> Maybe the low kick forces stand on hit
[0:47:06] <Kyllaruna> @Maximilian_DOOD i reckon you're using the charged moves only if they block, otherwise they're useless since it push the opponent away
[0:47:06] <SoupaSaiyajinGod> Say Hiii to me
[0:47:09] <phlie> @VFVirtuaVirtuousFighter Kappa
[0:47:12] <fdubpu> these charge moves look badass
[0:47:13] <glitchyPhantasma> what's the red directional mean? @maximilian_dood
[0:47:14] <Shreeder4092> Is that Dural?
[0:47:19] <jetstreamlove_R> Is this Sega's answer to Tekken?
[0:47:20] <DNICE3838> @kraftymattkraft  likely two months  but we dnt know for sure
[0:47:21] <%Baljhet> Ten thousand hours.
[0:47:22] <Wiiplayah43> @dwang the internet loves thirsting on women who could kill them
[0:47:23] <%SquallAdv> @robot_hero "to master" a char is difficult in every fg, inputs in VF are not hard for every character tbh, and it's really fun and easy to get into from the start, hard to master ofc
[0:47:24] <Emperor_Jagi_> Does the game feel similar to Tekken?
[0:47:24] <%Dwang> @LuxSignifer A month/2 months, but you can purchase it with a bundle w/ the DLC for $30
[0:47:24] <%juan1_2_3> Tekken feels

[0:47:27] <%Darnell16player> @elementor374  No i mean I have a VF game on ps2
[0:47:27] <Kobukson> the animations look insane for a 12 year old game
[0:47:28] <+theoryspark> technical almost to a fault
[0:47:30] <%Courser89> easy to play, hard to master
[0:47:30] <%ren0195> I'm going Lei Fei, I had fun with him with on PS2

[0:47:31] <ChaosImpact> Jean is a nightmare to play against if you have a habit of stand guard
[0:47:31] <%Bedskirts> that means nobody is good. so good for me
[0:47:32] <%Dwang> @glitchyPhantasma Hold direction

[0:47:38] <%icloudzero> All I hear is Gin n Juice
[0:47:39] <%acecondeuce> It's way easier to get into than Tekken imo
[0:47:43] <TarkamKrest> "How hard can it be? It only has 2 buttons" LMAO
[0:47:43] <+DogBomber> Did they make Dural concrete for censorship issues?
[0:47:43] <burning_storm> How do I play as a humanized Dural? Modders do your magic (on ps4)
[0:47:45] <%SquallAdv> VF is more similar to DOA than Tekken
[0:47:47] <CptCorgii> ground juggles and single frame moves
[0:47:47] <PKthundurr> feels more like doa
[0:47:49] <%BananaTheBread> i dont see you landing any of these on the doods unless you're canceling everything cause the doods be pressing buttons LUL
[0:47:49] <CapcomPresentMarvelComics> Yeah its one of those games the more you know the less you realize you know
[0:47:49] <%actor88> limbs arent buttons either
[0:47:50] <negace> it is a really technical game.
[0:47:50] <elementor374> @jetstreamlover_ryocan VF came first before Tekken bruh LUL
[0:47:51] <%TheHCSlipEntry> who has the Johnny Cage nutbreaker
[0:47:51] <ammobasket> @Jetstreamlover_ryocan Tekken is the answer to VF
[0:47:52] <bennythejet504> Jjyy1234 lol Tekken is child’s play compared to vf
[0:47:52] <+NumbNumbNut> so less clunky?
[0:47:54] <+Nocturne_Noble> Closer to DOA.

[0:47:57] <EtherNigh> @jetstreamlover_ryocan vf came firwt
[0:47:58] <krystalcute91> there VF spin off was virtua quest
[0:47:58] <%legendaryheroxx> @robot_hero happens alot in other fg's.
[0:47:59] <+theoryspark> More DoA than Tekken
[0:47:59] <+Kyl0oo> is it like DOA
[0:48:00] <%ungratefulkhuunt> block button
[0:48:00] <+supasnupak00pa> its actually closer to doa, just a bit slower
[0:48:01] <Autaki> so much easy to pull off korean backdash?
[0:48:02] <UniverseFlame> That's a great design philosophy. Easy to begin, but hard to master
[0:48:02] <%kn1ghtsabre> Shares more DNA with Dead or Alive
[0:48:04] <%Otoshi_Gami> Technical game hype :p
[0:48:04] <+utype> what makes it technical?
[0:48:07] <%skellyme> the back dash in this game covers alot more distance
[0:48:08] <%RoninWoof> VF's high technical hurdle is why the other fighters became more popular
[0:48:09] <%pinkdolphin95> It’s similar to DOA
[0:48:11] <ez__RAGE> Reminds me of Dead or Alive
[0:48:11] <%Darnell16player> I played VF4 on ps2 and some characters are beginner friendly. Some characters are more technical though combo wise @Maximilian_DOOD
[0:48:12] <%Cgame_me811> It’s more similar to doa

[0:48:54] <%SquallAdv> @Jetstreamlover_ryocan lmao, Tekken literally copied every aspect of VF since the 90s
[0:48:54] <%GamingFreakChris> he's definitely a karate type character
[0:48:55] <GilsoV> He`s even got some chains
[0:48:56] <%Pugweight> would you say that every fighting game should have this philosophy? easy to get into but really hard to master? @maximilian_dood

[0:51:39] <MaxXtreme23> As someone who's never played VF, what aspects specifically make it so much more technical than other 3D fighters? Is the execution really tight, like one frame links for combos? Are there specific mechanics that are difficult to master? People only go on about how much more complicated it is but never mention why it's more complicated
[0:51:41] <Redthemachine > dealy rave neo

[0:52:53] <%KraftyMattKraft> @maxxtreme23 The mixup game is insane. knowing stance, frames, position in the ring, and weight of the opponent are all factors in what combos or moves you are going to use
[0:52:53] <V0LK__> if you block you fucked, if you dont you fucked
[0:52:53] <%Azero_Tehiro> Think that's only a hit confirm.
[0:52:54] <Nayafer91> its a guard crush
[0:52:54] <%Dwang> @MaxXtreme23 The execution is WAY tighter than stuff like tekken, you have several one frame links, side/back attacks, charge moves, different grabs and it's all using 3 BUTTONS

[0:54:21] <%Grave_Wolf> @maximilian_dood ALL of the charge moves of his are guard breaks.
[0:54:22] <+Owltosser> VF is always a test of your reactions LUL
[0:54:22] <%blitz_1217> I wanna see how much damage it does
[0:54:22] <Kobukson> this is why vf is so deep
[0:54:22] <+VTheSandmanV> 2p

[0:54:26] <%Panda_and_Boo> Jean's whole deal is guard break. All his charge moves break guard in a way.
[0:54:26] <QuincyPwns> blocking is a decision that has risk yeah
[0:54:28] <zetta_vs> Can deflect
[0:54:28] <krystalcute91> @johnrod296 ps5
[0:54:28] <%Aresius_> Instill the FEAR
[0:54:29] <Kyllaruna> Is it not an overhead?
[0:54:30] <%Hung_Lao> anyone in chat having trouble doing a freakin' QCF

[0:54:32] <%Kenidashi> @unknlai crouch + punch = crunch I love it
[0:54:33] <%BloodyAntares> Scrubkiller move maybe
[0:54:34] <elementor374> @johnrod296 PS4 exclusive BUT you can play it on PS5
[0:54:35] <%XtemmA> turtle punish
[0:54:36] <Unknownkidx> Can vanessa auto counter that in defense mode?
[0:54:37] <%Bealy_beal> It seems kinda comparable to irl fighting
[0:54:37] <%Azero_Tehiro> I think the tracking on it is bad too, so you can sidestep.
[0:54:38] <%BlueFusionVolt> "Just don't be there" Kappa
[0:54:38] <%OmegaZeroX2> @donniebrasko1 Yo doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro doodGood ride26Calc mom0kaMythradab
[0:54:38] <+PhantasmaXD> @Xblaze2010 did you make your character on the ngs character creator yet?
[0:54:38] <%pinkdolphin95> You’re right @maximilian_dood
[0:54:40] <%Nmaster64> an overhead you don't want to block high
[0:54:43] <kiihaku> yesssss
[0:54:44] <OneHitUntilDeath> it definitely seems like more of a rock paper scissors kind of game
[0:54:44] <%SquallAdv> @Maximilian_DOOD also no comeback mechanics, no supers, learn or be destroyed ;)
[0:54:47] <Whorror> Just invest 10k hours 4Head
[0:54:47] <UniverseFlame> That's really cool. It makes you have to mix up your defense
[0:54:49] <+Nocturne_Noble> You're right. It's a reckoning for people who know and those don't. But the bar is the execution.
[0:54:49] <+redjoe1991> just dont get hit
[0:54:50] <dinhoxdinho> you can dick puch
[0:54:50] <$johnrod296> Oh ok
[0:54:53] <jamalo0o> guard break just like god hand PogChamp?
[0:54:53] <HazeRed> I think you can use a reversal against it?
[0:54:53] <%e1roy> i dont know if max talked about it but the confirmed release date for pso new genesis is the 9th!!!!
[0:54:54] <%Adrac88> DUMMY THICCCCCC

[0:55:00] <MiPapiiChulo> VF has crazy RPS elements
[0:55:00] <%ShinRukiri> Rollback? anybody got confirmation?
[0:55:01] <unknlai> only jean can do this it seems
[0:55:03] <InfernoStax> well yeah its a mix
[0:55:14] <%ChorusBass> Hey chat how do I find it on the ps4? I've restarted it and turned it off to try and "refresh" it but its not their
[0:55:14] <krystalcute91> @raijineko only ps5
[0:55:16] <CapcomPresentMarvelComics> I would assume the few lows you just did were mad unsafe
[0:55:16] <%krymzen5> krymzen5 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[0:55:18] <Wiiplayah43> @bealy_beal VF's whole design philosophy SeemsGood
[0:55:18] <%Brunty023> @e1roy Oh don't worry. He found out on Twitter too
[0:55:20] <+Tricky_vfdc> yea all they can do is either evade or duck it or stay out of range of it
[0:55:20] <%Nmaster64> yeah it's great
[0:55:22] <+Owltosser> Akira's Baji Quan style also has guard break moves too
[0:55:25] <DNICE3838> @raijineko  no just ps4  /ps5
[0:55:27] <@Nightbot> Check out NZXT’s newest Starter PC series! An excellent first gaming PC--perfect for school work and working from home while maintaining great gaming performance. Built and shipped within 48 hours with a 2-year warranty. http://nzxt.co/SPC_MaxChat
[0:55:27] <+utype> that's some sharp cheddar right there
[0:55:28] <NrgSpoon> it has a nice even rhythm
[0:55:28] <%Dwang> @Bealy_beal it's definitely because each character has their own IRL fighting style, like Lucha Libre or Vale Tudo
[0:55:29] <ez__RAGE> Is VF a 3 button fighting game?!?!?!?
[0:55:30] <%Kalzassa> notkohLurk
[0:55:32] <Unknownkidx> No rollback. It is absorb-based netcode
[0:55:33] <roqono> omg I love the hit sound effects
[0:55:34] <%Courser89> i think VF5 is apart of the PS+ games for June btw @Maximilian_DOOD
[0:55:34] <%TheHCSlipEntry> BRUTALITY
[0:55:34] <%Jinno9> can you just spam the K at the end?
[0:55:35] <siegfriedwolfz> Nice combo
[0:55:35] <%rtdc31> @raijineko Ps4 exclusive
[0:55:36] <%Pugweight> dont know if you care but DOOM is getting RTX support, looks sick @maximilian_dood
[0:55:37] <%Grave_Wolf> @maximilian_dood ALL of the charge moves of his are guard breaks.
[0:55:37] <+redjoe1991> would this be hard to get online
[0:55:37] <+Nocturne_Noble> Nope.
[0:55:38] <Kobukson> how does it feel playing on a stick?
[0:55:39] <%Raindancer0255> Does it whiff on ducking
[0:55:40] <rasouku> yeah that's why there is an evasion training
[0:55:40] <%Panda_and_Boo> No, this is more Jean's gimmick.
[0:55:40] <kakashihunter99> @raijineko nope, is PS4 and PS5 exclusive.
[0:55:41] <Profmcstevie> Landing that in a match is gonna feel SO GOOD for sure
[0:55:41] <%NurseLee> It all varies
[0:55:42] <Baryldn> can you turn on frame data in this mode?
[0:55:42] <snkkennyv> kazyua 5 hit combo
[0:55:43] <icano108> not every character has these options from what I understand.
[0:55:43] <%e1roy> @Brunty023 im hyped as fkk
[0:55:43] <frometheus> so what's his trade off for all this mixup/guard pressure
[0:55:44] <zetta_vs> Maybe Hold K is guard break
[0:55:45] <%VZLABoi> @ShinRukiri  is an old game no rollback, just delay but apparently uses relay servers for long distance matches
[0:55:45] <%Lliimbo> Not everyone
[0:55:45] <+LackingSanity_> only some characters
[0:55:45] <finecade> Dowloding now
[0:55:45] <hujkull> no, only some have breaks

[0:55:47] <%Dwang> @ez__rage yes, through and through
[0:55:49] <CapcomPresentMarvelComics> @Maximilian_DOOD  Does the game use blast processing Kappa
[0:55:49] <+Sekhon_98> Akira has a bunch doesn't he?
[0:55:52] <jetstreamlove_R> ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA!
[0:55:52] <SwankyTown> no, some characters have none
[0:55:53] <+Owltosser> No only some characters have them, some characters get reversals or stances
[0:55:54] <%Bealy_beal> @Maximilian_DOOD vf is kinda like the ultimate mma game. pretty realistic
[0:55:54] <superfamycom> Some don't have
[0:55:55] <%SharpsPanda> I think Akira has a guard break.
[0:55:55] <%sinistergojiraroll> Akira has this guard-break type of string but it's really tricky to pull off
[0:55:55] <McRayPlatinum> @krystalcute91 it’s on Ps4 too you just have to search the full name I’m currently downloading it now
[0:55:57] <%Lbeeztv> most characters have at least 1
[0:55:57] <@Belutima> @Kalzassa LuvSign
[0:55:58] <HazeRed> it's delay, but uses dedicated servers
[0:55:58] <TempestEvolution> I think every character gets a guard break moves

[0:56:10] <%BelovedGrey> Look at that fucking move
[0:56:12] <+yaboidustyy> Akira is Mr. Guard Break
[0:56:12] <+Tricky_vfdc> NO they do not all get it. It's what makes some character very strong sadly. Akira having the best one because of how fast it is. You can attack someone when they're trying to GB too
[0:56:13] <%memburberry> if I remember right Vanessa has like 4 or 5
[0:56:15] <DNICE3838> love sega n sony for this game ty
[0:56:16] <OneHitUntilDeath> seems like a bad idea to play someone without a guard break but I don't konw what everyone else has
[0:56:16] <Marvalis> This game is DEEP from what I remember
[0:56:16] <%Jflaskd13> ruthless combo
[0:56:17] <%Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> Thats some Mishima combination type shit

[0:56:42] <Cuill_> The arrows point to another planet
[0:56:43] <%NurseLee> @Sekhon_98 Akira does have one, and if successful guard break, he gets a guarantee fallow up.
[0:56:43] <colzack_> I can't imagine pulling these off in a fight
[0:56:44] <AlligatorsAreDope> This game seems perfect for Hitbox
[0:56:44] <%GamingFreakChris> time to piano that shit

[0:56:58] <%jcvicezero> what kind of combo is that
[0:56:58] <icano108> and lows are kinda bad in this game generally. Like some are negative on hit so high blocking is the go to.

[1:10:49] <+sol_badguy27> @Maximilian_DOOD Yes, any move that does more than 20 damage will beat wakeup attacks, specially if it has a lot of active frames. Jean's knee is perfect for that.
[1:10:51] <mr_amorim_> @gameontilt actually, both. They announced it would be on PS Now too.
[1:10:54] <%PrimalxGaming> @freakin_uuuh Do a search and put in the name Virtua Fighter 5. It took me a few tries and I got it. If you are on PS5, try getting it freom your PSN account online on PC or phone.
[1:10:54] <%Sdueno> This game will grow some hair

[1:11:20] <%Dwang> Chat, if you don't have PS Plus, you can still buy the game as is, there's a $30 bundle with the base game + Legendary Pack DLC. You still need PS Plus to play online, but that option's there
[1:11:20] <chain_edge> So, are the combos 10 minutes long like in Tekken or is a more neutral focused game?
[1:11:21] <8_drunken_gods> I've trained my hands with pornhub thank you atpRtsd4

[1:11:38] <zombie1061wii> oh epic, it's only $29.99
[1:11:39] <yoshi12345786> If you are getting Ultimate showdown and you have PS Plus do not by the bundle with dlc. Get the free version then buy the dlc because the bundle is $29.99 while the dlc by itself is just $9.99

[1:13:58] <+RatmanXVII> CHAT: if you're on PlayStation 5 and you see that it cost $29.99 click on the bubbles and choose the other version of the game and it should change to free!! good luck to people reading this doodGood doodBro
[1:13:59] <%MisterVFDC> I'm not myke I'm the italian wolf
[1:13:59] <%Baljhet> A lot of characters have parries, actually. Some characters are even built around them.
[1:14:00] <%fargone99> vanessa does
[1:14:06] <%Dwang> @Jetstreamlover_ryocan They're not, game director said in interviews that he doesn't like the idea of Kiryu fighting other women. But Majima's an open book
[1:14:07] <mrdude2u> @tylerdoug Yes. you have to stand still for some for an auto parry.
[1:14:07] <HazeRed> Aoi is entirely about parries
[1:14:07] <%coingray> I'm literally just following along with commands on my Hitbox and it feels amazing, but man I'd learn to play piano if I played this game doodLUL
[1:14:10] <A_m_v_J> Can you sidestep in the game?
[1:14:10] <itzyoboyg1> true since kiryu is not in tekken
[1:14:11] <McRayPlatinum> How long is this game going to be free for?
[1:14:12] <%Weevensteven> CHAT: if you're on PlayStation 5 and you see that it cost $29.99 click on the bubbles and choose the other version of the game and it should change to free!! good luck to people reading this doodGood doodBro TPFufun
[1:14:13] <blackcobra06> I hear max only, game quiet lol
[1:14:13] <%jvmccray> @tylerdoug Some do yes
[1:14:15] <+Resignedbc18> quarter circle forward p+k is a awesome parry
[1:14:17] <%Weevensteven> @ratmanxvii doodBro
[1:14:18] <helacious> parry seems slow, dunno if you can parry on reaction or just on guess
[1:14:20] <%MisterVFDC> tricky dont you dare telling him to play eileen
[1:14:23] <+DevastatingDemon> Ring outs felt like they ruined the battles
[1:14:23] <UriensMooreS> Ring outs are nice
[1:14:25] <SlimeRthyme> @jetstreamlover_ryocan I think the yakuza devs said kiryu will never being in fighting games because he doesn't hit women or something
[1:14:25] <Qsmash_> Kaeg-Maru
[1:14:27] <%izanagi22> !glossary
[1:14:27] <@Nightbot> https://glossary.infil.net/?t= Fighting game lingo can be confusing. Just frames? DHC? OTG? What the hell is a Rekka!? Check out the incredible Fighting Game glossary made by Infil for more info
[1:14:29] <%Dwang> @A_m_v_J Yes, and you can do offensive moves too
[1:14:31] <%im_SEPUlveda> only played vf2 in yakuza, im going to jump into this game's online blind lmao
[1:14:32] <%abielpadilla> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[1:14:32] <%joeisatrashcomposer> this is like a musical mix between ff7r colosseum and the reno/rude fight
[1:14:33] <neo_nerv> You can recente
[1:14:33] <unknlai> and Aoi is full of parry movement xd
[1:14:36] <%chedmond> I found it.  Downloading now.  Thanks chat doodz.
[1:14:37] <%jvmccray> @hazered Aoi main here, she’s freaking amazing! Love her ground throws too
[1:14:40] <%Sanguine_King> what do those circular attacks mean chat?
[1:14:41] <%Lbeeztv> Sega was in KingJae's stream earlier and did confirm a PS5 patch is coming but gave no details
[1:14:42] <%Onyx_13k> Is there a larger stage?
[1:14:43] <%xrosheart19> guys go to the psn website if you cant see it  on the psn store on your ps4?
[1:14:45] <%KraftyMattKraft> @mistervfdc ah! been to SoCal for VFDC meets? I cannot remember everyone I've met.
[1:14:45] <+TheWordPlay> I love the impact sfx in this game
[1:14:47] <%Weevensteven> @chedmond doodBro
[1:14:48] <%xrosheart19> ps4
[1:14:48] <tacticalnuke002> Majima should go to Tekken. VF doesn't use weapons. Kiryu fits VF
[1:14:50] <+Tricky_vfdc> set cpu for CH for these next combos. [4][P][+][K] CH   [9][K][+][G] ► [3][3][P][K]
[1:14:52] <%MisterVFDC> it's a sabaki for punches mid and highs, gives the same game 55P does
[1:14:54] <ChaosImpact> Goh and Aoi have SO MANY PARRIES
[1:14:55] <NrgSpoon> @neo_nerv he doesn't have R3 on his fight stick
[1:14:57] <its_the_ether_bunny> it's so weird that it only shows up if you search on the ps app, on the ps4 store i couldn't find it
[1:14:58] <%IMDRanged> I forget how 2007 version looks like now, this looks great.  I have to check for a Digital Foundry episode
[1:14:59] <%SquallAdv> yeah game is out, but you have to search it manually on the store, including "ultimate", it'll not show as a monthly psplus game yet
[1:15:04] <Novinworks> So you maining Jean? @maximilian_dood
[1:15:04] <Unknownkidx> Maybe chose a stage with no ring out for practicing?
[1:15:06] <%Aberration0> Hey chat, hope everyone's well tonight! doodBro
[1:15:06] <%MisterVFDC> never been tu murika unfortunately
[1:15:06] <GurglingGoblin> why is he wearing a training bra?
[1:15:06] <%BloodyAntares> Damn this song slaps
[1:15:07] <%Dwang> @Sanguine_King Different attack directions, might attack on the left or right side
[1:15:09] <cobatron> ride26Cozy
[1:15:11] <+RatmanXVII> @weevensteven just9nKiss No thank you dood
[1:15:11] <MikeyxStyles> who you all maining?
[1:15:13] <%jakangg> Thanks doods the first time I've  seen sony do this i just  added  it doodGood flynnokNom flynnokNom
[1:15:14] <Chaosmaster8753> you think VF will eventually get added to the FG Glossary?
[1:15:15] <HazeRed> go through the Aoi move list, and you'll be amazed at how many things she can parry
[1:15:15] <+Michael_jpeg> Does VF not have infinite stages?
[1:15:18] <BK_Vatras> Kiryu and Majima are great, but y'all can't forget Yagami.
[1:15:18] <+Mr_Weenie> Go to *** website and search "Virtua Fighter"
[1:15:20] <TheDangerRanger> i think this game's stages are mostly on the small side
[1:15:22] <%MisterVFDC> cpu settings

[1:15:25] <%Bluntfuls> doodbenny
[1:15:28] <%SharpsPanda> Characters in this game are so cool. Vanessa gets two stances and her defensive stance auto parry highs.
[1:15:29] <%VZLABoi> @Mr_Weenie Only mods can post links in the chatroom, Twitch autoremoves links posted by anyone else
[1:15:30] <DNICE3838> its in new games in psn store
[1:15:30] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> Sounds awesome! doodGood
[1:15:31] <neo_nerv> You can recenter by clicking R3.
[1:15:31] <+Tricky_vfdc> this one is more complicated but i think you can do it [4][P][P] (charge) [K] (Side) CH   [6][6][P] ► [6][K] (CH) ► continue with 6K combos
[1:15:31] <%Darnell16player> @Chaosmaster8753 yeah
[1:15:33] <%xrosheart19> i want to play as EL BLAZE
[1:15:36] <%SquallAdv> @IMDRanged just go to the store on console and type "virtua fighter 5 ultimate", it'll show as a free psplus download
[1:15:36] <%OmegaZeroX2> @rawrsong but you forget all of the existing PSO2  fanbase as well as new people will be playing this it'll be fine not as strong of a launch it could've been but it'll be fine and you forget the fact it'll be free compared to every other game
[1:15:37] <%Brunty023> @Sanguine_King Sorta like the homing attacks in Tekken
[1:15:37] <majin_erick> oh now if they teased VF6, I'm in.
[1:15:38] <Lucoa_Best_Dragon> Is It bad that I wanna main T.Arashi?
[1:15:38] <%Sanguine_King> @Sanguine_King gotcha, thank you friend
[1:15:38] <kamen_itachi> how about lion?
[1:15:39] <%Dwang> @MikeyxStyles Was maining Kage Maru, but giving a chance to El Blaze!
[1:15:40] <%SharpsPanda> Auto parry high punches*
[1:15:40] <JojoNyPr1> doodDead
[1:15:44] <itzyoboyg1> also true yagami is goated
[1:15:44] <ChaosImpact> Then why didn't you play Lion, Max LUL
[1:15:45] <%Weevensteven> @ratmanxvii no big wanted to be helpful to the doods TPFufun
[1:15:45] <kiihaku> ps app is the way to go low key
[1:15:45] <%RofflessLWK> Yeah ngl, after playing through all the Yakuza games, it'd be SUPER weird to see Kiryu hit women, even as a guest character in a fighting game LUL LUL
[1:15:46] <%darthchungus2001> darthchungus2001 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Love the streams Dood. SHINE ON!
[1:15:51] <demipersonas> imma play Venessa
[1:15:52] <%Dwang> @neo_nerv he's on a fightstick, it doesn't have R3
[1:15:59] <dinhoxdinho> @neo_nerv he's in a arcade stick
[1:15:59] <jetstreamlove_R> Sega could make some exceptions whit the Kiryu thing since this could mean a lot of money
[1:15:59] <%SuperMimtemdo> SuperMimtemdo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:16:01] <Novinworks> Jean is a well-rounded character

[1:16:04] <$CeeJayOrJustC> Vanessa is basically 2 characters in one
[1:16:05] <hivehivehivehivehivehive> i love how realistic the combos are. no energy blasts or anything
[1:16:05] <+Resignedbc18> forward K+G up forward K+G
[1:16:06] <%IMDRanged> @SquallAdv Cool Thank you
[1:16:08] <tatsu00> Holy shit Jean is hella fun lol
[1:16:08] <PeronSouls> spooky was learning jackie earlyer
[1:16:12] <+Owltosser> @Sanguine_King it means the attack comes from left or right, and you have to side step either toward or away from the camera. Basically you have to sidestep to the correct side to dodge it. A completely circular attack is full horizontal (eg sweep) and can't be sidestepped
[1:16:16] <BK_Vatras> Play whoever your heart desires, chat. aspreyFlan
[1:16:34] <+dukeofdemons> yo this games looks great on an Oled with PS5
[1:16:34] <JojoNyPr1> doodNoThx
[1:16:34] <+Tricky_vfdc> if you set CPU to tech roll after knockdown you can time you 3P+K to him the meaty where if they press anything other than block you hit them
[1:16:37] <+Revellius> Is VF more complex than Tekken?
[1:16:38] <helacious> @Maximilian_DOOD whats your catch side step move?
[1:16:42] <NaughtyJuri> please download VF if you have PS plus to show support
[1:16:42] <%VmachineV1> SourPls
[1:16:42] <silverglove2012> I like ninja
[1:16:44] <itzyoboyg1> they could make him like sanji in jumpforce
[1:16:45] <%deathspit00> But I wanna main Jacky. Who among us wouldn't want to kick sss with Jeet Kun Do?
[1:16:47] <%Darnell16player> @BK_Vatras TRUE
[1:16:47] <%Dwang> @BK_Vatras Except Lion. Delete Lion from the game pls and thank you
[1:16:47] <%Brunty023> @MikeyxStyles I'm re-learning Sarah and Brad who are my new mains. I don't have the willpower I used to have to re-learn Akira! LUL
[1:16:48] <%issun_boushi> @Jetstreamlover_ryocan  Make Kiryu like Sanji in one piece games, he actually can not fight women, he jus starts doing joke stuff
[1:16:48] <%IMDRanged> Its not Sumo Ring Ring Out
[1:16:50] <its_the_ether_bunny> also chat if you have ps+ and only ps4 you can claim the free ps5 ps+ games for later through the app too
[1:16:51] <DJ_is_Raiden> what are these mecha anime ass sound fx????
[1:16:53] <cressedangel12> @jetstreamlover_ryocan or, they add the protagonist from Judgement
[1:16:55] <%SquallAdv> @majin_erick you should give it a try, VF5 is super mefa fun, and playing it you're giving hope for a VF6 in the future
[1:16:56] <%callmecornbread> @maximilian_dood doodNuts Hey man, how come you aren’t very active on YouTube anymore? Miss those high quality scripted-type videos.
[1:16:56] <%Lbeeztv> Everyone in VF is really good, there isnt any true low tier characters
[1:17:00] <%chedmond> I really like Jean's combo timing delay ability.
[1:17:05] <+Tricky_vfdc> (Crumple) > [6][6][P] CH [3][3][P][K] ; catch sidestep with 4PP
[1:17:06] <%MisterAJ1993> Jean Look like a Fusion Ken and Kuja from FF9
[1:17:17] <+stormhowl_fgc> Jean circulars are 5K+G and 2K+G
[1:17:18] <hujkull> k+g
[1:17:19] <+Noveus> As a Vanessa main I hate Jean cause it's her worst match-up. LUL
[1:17:21] <@Nightbot> Check out our latest merch! Shirts, posters, mugs and more - https://maxdood.tv/merch
[1:17:26] <BK_Vatras> @BK_Vatras Don't be such a knucklehead. aspreyShrug
[1:17:27] <%Dwang> @Revellius 100% yes, there's a lot of moves you can do with a character, one-frame links, charge moves, etc with just 3 buttons
[1:17:27] <HazeRed> skill ceiling is so high on every character
[1:17:27] <ChaosImpact> The Bryant family is a great starter. Their moves look fancy and their string is easy to use
[1:17:30] <zetta_vs> PP LUL
[1:17:30] <DNICE3838> man this game is amazing
[1:17:39] <%SorcererLance> @MisterAJ1993 I'd say more Xion from Bloody Roar Primal Fury
[1:17:44] <+Tricky_vfdc> also 2K+G can knock them down into great oki
[1:17:46] <Novinworks> If people keep playing this game it will lead to VF6
[1:17:48] <%Sanguine_King> @Sanguine_King damn, thats pretty cool, thank you!
[1:17:50] <tarek_el_pimente> man the combo juggles are hella ugly in this game
[1:17:53] <%Weevensteven> my game downloaded
[1:17:53] <%BignanasTheGawd> ez game
[1:17:53] <%SquallAdv> @DNICE3838 it is <3
[1:17:58] <romeodejulieta> !time
[1:17:58] <DSD24> Sarah's so cool
[1:18:00] <hivehivehivehivehivehive> i would be more into side step fighting games if juggling didnt make them react the exact same way every hit
[1:18:01] <%KraftyMattKraft> Lau Chan is also pretty easy to start with.
[1:18:02] <Biyonzo> im confused what is tutorial dodge 4
[1:18:02] <+sol_badguy27> Nice Hellsweep
[1:18:03] <%Dwang> @Maximilian_DOOD What about Lion? coxKappa
[1:18:06] <%yeknomlive> jacky has a flip kick done
[1:18:10] <HitscanSedan> hows leo?
[1:18:10] <@ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY> @Maximilian_DOOD Good Evening Max. Hope you day was well
[1:18:11] <Wolfsajin> Venessa ftw
[1:18:13] <%SeanmanderPlays> cool
[1:18:14] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> What if I want to play as a big dude who wants to throw down?
[1:18:15] <%Retribution888> Bruce Lee
[1:18:16] <IllegalDefender> counter hits are still on
[1:18:16] <%chedmond> All are tough to master, but some are easier to press buttons and get moves than others.
[1:18:17] <MikeyxStyles> I'm maining brad
[1:18:19] <+Tricky_vfdc> best to figure out oki by setting CPU to tech roll. This way you know how long it takes for them to get up.
[1:18:19] <DracOmega64> Hehe PP lytSNEER
[1:18:20] <%yeknomlive> im gonna play that muay thai dude cause his theme is sick
[1:18:25] <%MisterAJ1993> @SorcererLance  Good Point.
[1:18:28] <JojoNyPr1> doodDah
[1:18:29] <SlimeRthyme> LUL
[1:18:29] <DSD24> Sarah has flip kicks too
[1:18:29] <%TheHCSlipEntry> i want a character who plays like ManBearPig
[1:18:31] <TLF_Arrow> @maximilian_dood What are the big things that seperate VF from Tekken?
[1:18:32] <NaughtyJuri> Sarah & Vanessa <3
[1:18:33] <xdill0x> If you like throwing old dudes over a fence...play Kage Kappa
[1:18:33] <+sol_badguy27> The joys of having good movement available from the start. <3
[1:18:34] <%AdmiralWafflez> AdmiralWafflez subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! Apparently I didn't miss my streak doodSurvive
[1:18:35] <%Dr_Knifedad> "Mother fucker think he Bruce Lee"
[1:18:39] <Saibot_Renzo> Is Vanessa in this one?
[1:18:40] <+Vytaminz> the hardest to master is Akira imo
[1:18:42] <+TheWordPlay> I think The Chan family are pretty good starters as well
[1:18:43] <jtk1401> Bye doods! Se you tomorrow :)
[1:18:44] <alinktothefutur3> My game is still downloading but from what I’ve seen all the stages look really good doodGood
[1:18:44] <+Papafleish> what if I want to start as an annoying french twink who fights the elderly?
[1:18:45] <SheepGetGud> 6gk into 3gk is a satisfying high starter
[1:18:45] <%xrosheart19> what does the legacy DLC have if you choose to pay the 29.99 price tag?
[1:18:47] <GilsoV> Flamingo Stance
[1:18:47] <%Onyx_13k> @Maximilian_DOOD It shows in the top right when a move is tracking and how it tracks
[1:18:48] <MikeyxStyles> a boxer. and it's a kick boxer? how could I not play brad
[1:18:51] <%Kalzassa> sprixeSipsip
[1:18:51] <$CeeJayOrJustC> yes
[1:18:53] <%Dwang> @Saibot_Renzo yes
[1:18:53] <databyte> I dont see this game on ps4 is it only for ps5?
[1:18:54] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Who is most unga @Maximilian_DOOD ?

[1:19:03] <finecade> I main vf‘s honda
[1:19:04] <%Thejuanandonly559> Idk I like brad burns he’s cool I think probably going to be my main
[1:19:07] <tacticalnuke002> Monke girl Eileen is pretty beginner friendly as well
[1:19:11] <%Darnell16player> who's a character who has kickboxing style?
[1:19:11] <%krysis12> @databyte New Games
[1:19:11] <%Axle13j> @databyte ps plus section
[1:19:15] <%ToraWrathUwU> doodDerp
[1:19:17] <valokiteshvara> Mine will take all night to download so this is nice to tide me over and learn a bit too <3
[1:19:19] <itzyoboyg1> I'll just play wolf and slam people lol
[1:19:19] <mr_amorim_> @databyte no, ps4 too.
[1:19:20] <%catgirlsarereal_> vf is very conditioning heavy
[1:19:21] <+Tricky_vfdc> [4][P][+][K][+][G] (sabaki) [P] or [2][P][+][K][+][G] (sabaki) [P]   [9][K][+][G] ► [3][3][P]
[1:19:23] <DNICE3838> @xrosheart19  all the extra stuff
[1:19:25] <+Mr_Weenie> @databyte search it on ps store website
[1:19:27] <Saibot_Renzo> Oh nice thanks chat :)
[1:19:27] <+bgeminii> Why do people compare Virtua Fighter and Tekken lol
[1:19:28] <jetstreamlove_R> Judgement dude wouldn't work much, gotta be someone iconic like Kiryu or at least goro. Might be misremembering but in project x zone 2 you can play as both Kiryu and Goro. There's some feminine enemies.
[1:19:28] <Neoxon> I’m just playing Vanessa until my VF5 rust comes off, as I’m pretty sure my old combos will eventually come back to me
[1:19:29] <+Nocturne_Noble> Vanessa is two characters in one.
[1:19:29] <%PrimalxGaming> @Darnell16player Brad Burns
[1:19:31] <%NurseLee> Also VF has no Projectiles to worry as much.
[1:19:32] <%Thejuanandonly559> @darnell16player brad burns
[1:19:32] <+theoryspark> ya'll should compare this game more to DoA if at all possible
[1:19:34] <Whorror> @Darnell16player Brad
[1:19:35] <MikeyxStyles> @darnell16player brad
[1:19:37] <+Abridgedbeast> jean is my favorite
[1:19:40] <+togawa10> Tekken relies more on defensive tactics
[1:19:41] <+Owltosser> I'm very beginner at tekken and casual at VF, but afaik you don't need to learn korean backdash in VF :D
[1:19:42] <greycreeze2345> @Biyonzo you mean evasion 4? You have to sidestep then dash and Guard (Very tight timing). So Tap up then Forward Forward as soon as you see the sidestep then guard the roundhouse
[1:19:42] <FluffyMikeB> Tekken is juggle simulator.
[1:19:42] <%SorcererLance> @Maximilian_DOOD safe guess the Genesis game isn't worth playing?
[1:19:45] <%GenesisKnight> It feels like VF rounds have a short timer to force you to be aggressive
[1:19:46] <rughar> i used to play akira early games and his chain grapple moves destroyed my fingers.
[1:19:49] <%TheHCSlipEntry> doodDead doodRage
[1:19:49] <%xrosheart19> @DNICE3838 like what?
[1:19:49] <ChaosImpact> Every character has even exsisted in the series is playable in Ultimate Showdown, chat ( except for Dural)
[1:19:54] <+Tricky_vfdc> exactly! you're getting it
[1:19:55] <+TheKirblet> Have the overall mechanics and flow remained similar through the games or have they changed drastically @Maximilian_DOOD ?
[1:19:56] <HazeRed> for me, VF feels the closest to 3rd Strike
[1:19:56] <%Cobaltios> @Jetstreamlover_ryocan Majima would be a good pick
[1:19:58] <%Dwang> Like I read in an article this week, Playing VF compared to other fighters is like playing chess while others are playing checkers
[1:19:58] <Monstanimation> I think Tekken is more about movement and VF more about reaction
[1:20:04] <%pizzacake70> is this ps5 only?
[1:20:08] <Jpdestiny> Arya said on his stream that VF is more offensive and Tekken is more defensive
[1:20:09] <+TheWordPlay> VF is heavy on aggression and I love it
[1:20:09] <%TokenBlackDood> @bgeminii because 3D fighters and Tekken was a rip off of VF for a long time

[1:20:13] <mr_amorim_> @bgeminii because my guess is that Tekken is the first 3d fighting game that comes to people's mind. That's why
[1:20:14] <+adlarryy> why does this game look soooo dope
[1:20:19] <Kobukson> if you like kung fu movies, vf is your game
[1:20:22] <%VZLABoi> @pizzacake70  is a PS4 game
[1:20:24] <DNICE3838> @xrosheart19  music  customs stuff n more
[1:20:25] <%SharpsPanda> @pizzacake70 No, PS4/5
[1:20:26] <+Tricky_vfdc> exactly you get it
[1:20:26] <+LBKnightmare> God I love these games
[1:20:28] <%Dwang> @pizzacake70 Nope, PS4 game for now but it can play on PS5
[1:20:30] <%th3rdtime> When u back up, it feels like nothing but hard reads
[1:20:30] <%Thejuanandonly559> @pizzacake70 PS4/ps5
[1:20:31] <AlexanderArts> Is this game free to play, or on PS+ or something? I can't remember.
[1:20:31] <sappinmahbinyot> Wait there's combos in VF?
[1:20:31] <itzyoboyg1> i wished akira played the way he does in doa5
[1:20:32] <%Jinno9> that two punch is just like Jin's
[1:20:35] <%thedrawingbored> There are so many subtle things and variations that they put into Jean's stance animation. It is pretty impressive.
[1:20:35] <%Kel_Ebek> man can't wait to play this in next Yakuza game PridePog
[1:20:37] <hivehivehivehivehivehive> @Maximilian_DOOD ever played for honor?
[1:20:40] <+ReiDuran> He's wearing a sports bra
[1:20:41] <%Darnell16player> Thanks everyone! It'll be a first of playing VF since VF4 on ps2
[1:20:43] <+Resignedbc18> lol
[1:20:44] <wiqidbritt> VF animations have always been great
[1:20:45] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:20:49] <Lanoom1> cuppLurk
[1:20:50] <DeliLizard> vf combos are hype
[1:20:52] <%pizzacake70> thanks guys!
[1:20:56] <%Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> @Maximilian_DOOD that video last night was INSANE
[1:20:58] <%Myloe> does this game have combo trials?
[1:20:59] <kamen_itachi> and a lot of nut hate
[1:20:59] <+CrashTestGremlin> I'm 3 matches in, netplay is good so far
[1:21:00] <bassit> you COMBO with your nuts?
[1:21:00] <+Tricky_vfdc> do you want side crumpe combos and wall combos??
[1:21:00] <valokiteshvara> Sc6 animations are great too
[1:21:00] <%VZLABoi> @tylerdoug  the beta, not his cup of tea
[1:21:00] <Profmcstevie> The hitsparks were direly needed imo, it ups satisfaction 100%
[1:21:01] <%Dwang> @Kel_Ebek This is FROM the Yakuza devs LUL
[1:21:02] <%RoninWoof> @maxShow us the video!!!
[1:21:02] <ChaosImpact> The animation in this game is still the same since 2007 like HOLY SHIT. It's still top tier
[1:21:03] <%UndeservingKonomichan> abbaPog
[1:21:04] <%impoolse> yea vf has the zombie like bounce and its fun as hell
[1:21:04] <PeronSouls> Akira has a TOD right?
[1:21:05] <%Sagaftw> oooh are you playing it on the PS5? @Maximilian_DOOD
[1:21:05] <%KraftyMattKraft> @maximilian_dood With Tekken you can go "autopilot" and still do okay. VF5 is mentally taxing, and going autopilot will hand you a loss quicker than you can hit G
[1:21:06] <mr_amorim_> @pizzacake70 no, ps4 too. Try to search it in the app too.
[1:21:08] <Crippl3> @AlexanderArts ps+
[1:21:09] <EnenArt> can someone link a hype set?
[1:21:09] <sappinmahbinyot> Oh that's HYPE
[1:21:09] <thang2709> this game doesnt look as clean as tekken
[1:21:10] <$CeeJayOrJustC> Last night??? WHERE?
[1:21:10] <%Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> The Akira last night was BONKERS
[1:21:11] <%Otoshi_Gami> Pretty much. lots of executions
[1:21:12] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> Yeah that combo video was ridiculous doodTerror
[1:21:12] <dscarface07> someone pm me the link to the video?

[1:21:14] <BK_Vatras> Real ass martial arts, touched up with hand animation. Beautiful aspreyFlan
[1:21:16] <DNICE3838> this game is fast too
[1:21:17] <zzz_nuke> the vf finals that you watched was from old vf or this one?
[1:21:17] <NaughtyJuri> Of course it has combos LUL
[1:21:17] <+bgeminii> DOA is a better comparison tbh cause it’s the same play style
[1:21:26] <Ibadss> link me the combo wideo link me
[1:21:26] <%predac0n> you gotta  have a big ass galacticbrain for those combos
[1:21:27] <%deathspit00> I'ma definitely have to change my button layouts for this.
[1:21:30] <+EverybodyHasAPryce> @TokenBlackDood Yeah, I love all the Tekkens, but Tekken 1 and 2 are pretty much straight up VF. Starts to make its own way in 3 though.
[1:21:33] <%jakangg> @pizzacake70  PS4 but I'm  pretty sure u can get it on PS5 but it will be PS4 version
[1:21:35] <+Tricky_vfdc> [3][K] (Side CH) CH   [1][P][+][K] ► [P][K][P] (charge) [K] offensive move to their side
[1:21:37] <Immortal_Volkan> you are talking about combos while i cant get past the evasion tutorial...
[1:21:37] <topgunLT1> arnt these similar to dead or alive combos
[1:21:37] <LeoSageTV> it's jin without the horns and wings
[1:21:41] <TrashLeviathan> this music is a bop
[1:21:44] <+LBKnightmare> doodDerp
[1:21:47] <Doublenyher> i hope they add the bikini outfits back
[1:21:47] <HazeRed> what was the video called?
[1:21:48] <Chaosmaster8753> DoA has a similar button layout as this
[1:21:54] <just_one_sock> what is so great about the animations? just looks like... less pretty tekken animations
[1:21:55] <zzz_nuke> thats cool
[1:22:00] <dragonpunchclub> Press 2 p+k after launcher and follow up with 46pk
[1:22:01] <SDSakuragi> as a sfv player, i have to ask, why is everyone's hands and feet so tiny?
[1:22:03] <%Dwang> heck, this is VF3 fast, right? Or are they similar in terms of speed? @Maximilian_DOOD
[1:22:07] <+HeLooksAngry> Is there an option for OG graphics in this update?
[1:22:09] <+Dieelon> @Maximilian_DOOD have you mentioned before what stick you use for the ps5?
[1:22:09] <Profmcstevie> They've been around since Youtube existed almost LUL
[1:22:10] <NaughtyJuri> @bgeminii Tekken,DOA are both good but VF just amazing to watch at high level
[1:22:10] <upgrayedd3105> I’m sorry but that chain belt thing looks really stupid
[1:22:10] <sappinmahbinyot> Chat do you think this game will get a PC port? It looks mad interesting and I really wanna play it
[1:22:11] <%Kel_Ebek> nah this one missing core values @bgeminii
[1:22:13] <+Resignedbc18> i watched a tutorial that was from 4 years ago

[1:22:22] <FrostedZaibatsu> Oh, so its at its base the same game??
[1:22:26] <+awi5951> thats why soul caliber pisses me off they changed moves that have been the same for years it pissed me off
[1:22:27] <krystalcute91> VF x esports max
[1:22:31] <+Tricky_vfdc> homestay akira is the best akira in the world atm
[1:22:31] <%Dwang> @SDSakuragi They don't have exaggerated proportions spethLaugh
[1:22:31] <mr_amorim_> @just_one_sock I mean  these animations are like 15 years old. Don't you think they're good if you count that?
[1:22:33] <+stormhowl_fgc> Homestay Akira is one of the Akira gods
[1:22:34] <%FalzarTG> You never watched tourneys?

[1:22:38] <%yeknomlive> hey chat fuudo started in vf right?
[1:22:38] <+raw_sawce> homestay akira

[1:22:46] <hujkull> @redjoe1991 homestay akira look him up
[1:22:46] <machriphi> @FrostedZaibatsu Yeah, this is an HD Remaster essentially. The it's the exact same game.
[1:22:47] <%MoonxLxght> super refined over the years
[1:22:48] <%Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> Guy named Rodney, He's the best Akira in NA
[1:22:50] <+BloodBerry_> homestay akira
[1:22:51] <%predac0n> is Kage fun to play ? @Maximilian_DOOD
[1:22:51] <SlimeRthyme> sucks they didn't do any balance patch
[1:22:52] <+RobinFoDays> any 3rd party characters?
[1:22:55] <+Resignedbc18> down forward K+G is a bounce i think
[1:22:56] <%Supersonic540> @just_one_sock its the fine details in the movments. tekken has flashier animations, but these are far more fluid and realistic comparitively speaking
[1:23:00] <%PrimalxGaming> There are no top/low tier in this game. Only characters that are are more familiar to you.

[1:23:22] <+arcadus07> rip
[1:23:22] <+HeLooksAngry> Pro-tier VF is not for new players
[1:23:22] <%yhmjack1> wait, you can play VF5US on PS5?

[1:23:26] <+Azure_Black> That guy looks like RYU. He must be EASY
[1:23:26] <%GamingFreakChris> Akira is the main character. Akira is not the go-to easy character

[1:23:30] <%retrozaid> cirLaugh

[1:23:35] <+Owltosser> @Maximilian_DOOD can you show us Akira's moves?
[1:23:36] <Saibot_Renzo> Lmaoo Akira is hard asf
[1:23:37] <leshark5> why exactly is he so hard

[1:23:39] <%Helius82> you done joofed LUL
[1:23:39] <Andrako> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:23:39] <%JohoZX> i just went through to the training again. I could not get good at the evasion stuff haha
[1:23:39] <+CrashTestGremlin> I chose Shun di as my first, did I fuck up?
[1:23:40] <%GamingFreakChris> Akira to VF is like Kazuya for Tekken
[1:23:41] <Meranglemtur> whats a good starter character for a completely newbie for VF
[1:23:41] <Snowkoi_> 10 years too early to play Akira
[1:23:42] <TLF_Arrow> Akira is a MEATY character in terms of what he can do
[1:23:43] <NaughtyJuri> LUL
[1:23:43] <%im_SEPUlveda> i picked buff tanned grill 🌞
[1:23:43] <thebrogems> What about Vanessa?
[1:23:45] <%deltashizuna> trll them about the knee
[1:23:45] <dovahkin2697> whose a good rey mysterio player?
[1:23:46] <TheKingofUruk> Akira is uber fun do NOT pick him as a starter
[1:23:46] <%fancyfantasy> akira will chew you up and spit you out
[1:23:47] <Vashido22> @maximilian_dood the 1f Knee?
[1:23:47] <+Zaph__Kiel> his inputs are stupid hard compared to other characters
[1:23:48] <FrostedZaibatsu> @machriphi Got you. What if they did this for 3rd Strike?
[1:23:48] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> Oh no LUL
[1:23:48] <ShiggySB> janixDEVIOUS
[1:23:50] <Lone_Tone> the knee?
[1:23:50] <kora766> The infamous move!
[1:23:52] <+HeLooksAngry> Wait, Goh is also Super Dope.
[1:23:52] <%MateriaGuru> Yeah goh isn't easy
[1:23:53] <%deltashizuna> THE KNEEE
[1:23:54] <%finalfx2001> I really want play Vanessa
[1:23:55] <%krysis12> Vanessa looked cool af
[1:23:55] <+raw_sawce> KNEE
[1:23:56] <%Brunty023> @darkmoonhero El Blaze is great! Loved playing the hell out of him in vanilla VF5
[1:23:56] <+Resignedbc18> akrias 1 frame links are crazy
[1:23:57] <Bazal68k> Yes. Pick Jacky, Sarah, Lau or Goh. Vanessa if you want a grappler.
[1:23:58] <%yeknomlive> we're 10 years to early D:
[1:23:59] <Crippl3> It's really weird to me that Akira is the mascot character of the series, but he's one of the hardest to play
[1:23:59] <%wordz1> wordz1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[1:24:00] <+Mcmoblin> Akira is a Mushima...... You don't play them unless you know
[1:24:00] <%chedmond> @Maximilian_DOOD Same.  VF is my favorite 3D fighting game series of all time, but I doubt I'll ever get above a semi-competent casual level.
[1:24:00] <MKTank_754> fuck that, go play Akira if you want to
[1:24:01] <mr_amorim_> @yhmjack1 as backwards compatible title, yes. Nothing extra fancy on ps5.
[1:24:01] <wiqidbritt> most characters you can spam punches, Akira cannot
[1:24:01] <SlightlyErotic> @Meranglemtur Jacky
[1:24:01] <%akumakid13> Goh i would say is not a friendly character imo. he needs character match up knolege
[1:24:02] <TheMostEpicUnicorn> I want to learn the drunk guy,  he looks so fun
[1:24:02] <+pkmamsters> I adore that the BIG KUNG FU man is the wildest character
[1:24:02] <%majikel1989> the jack knee
[1:24:04] <+MrJ0el> I'm actually stuck on this move LUL
[1:24:04] <%branh0913> Akira requires a lot of timing
[1:24:04] <%Darnell16player> Akira = You goofed as a beginner
[1:24:04] <drogba5612> ima being playing rey mysterio and the lei fei guy and the ninja
[1:24:05] <itzyoboyg1> akira is awesome if u can get his stuff down
[1:24:06] <$xXxPS9xXx> @yhmjack1 You can play almost any PS4 game (and certainly any PS4 game coming out now) on PS5
[1:24:07] <+unspeakableevil> Funny how the poster boy is hard to play LUL
[1:24:07] <NrgSpoon> Akira is there to be like "this is what you can aspire to become in 10 years, now go pick another character"
[1:24:10] <+K9Player> KG, let go G after 1 frame
[1:24:11] <%Bloodninja15> I couldn't even do his mooves in DoA
[1:24:12] <%catgirlsarereal_> hes the vf equivalent of a mishima
[1:24:12] <%GhostWolf1988> Well Akira is not all about fully combos like jacky
[1:24:13] <%MisterAJ1993> I manage to do decent stuff with Akira
[1:24:16] <Meranglemtur> gotcha
[1:24:16] <%Dwang> @Meranglemtur Goh or Sarah should be perfect to start. Or Leon
[1:24:16] <%IMDRanged> He's not Ryu friendly
[1:24:22] <CaptainKladdkaka> oh look it's mister Snow
[1:24:23] <%jakangg> SEE? LUL
[1:24:23] <Metalgaiden96 > But I WANT to play him anyways. Even despite the struggle. Lol.
[1:24:25] <+CHEETO_TAXES> I've been trying it all night the Knee wont come out PepeHands
[1:24:25] <%deltashizuna> precise inputs only
[1:24:26] <valokiteshvara> Any idea why they dropped VF4's quest mode? Was so cool.
[1:24:31] <%KraftyMattKraft> @maximilian_dood do spod and you know you are ready
[1:24:31] <GilsoV> What was the thing that guy said? "It`s like trying to paint a mural using a shopping cart in each hand"
[1:24:33] <DeliLizard> lol
[1:24:33] <@HurtboxTV> I picked up VF5US earlier today and just did his knee like 6 out of 10 times lol Jacky's 6K:G is fucking hard
[1:24:34] <+cascadepersona> LOL
[1:24:36] <%chedmond> I can't play VF on a pad myself.

[1:31:29] <ArianRD1> This is pretty much just an Akira thing, all of the other characters are nothing compared to this.
[1:31:30] <%Dwang> @DreamPhantasyTV yes, there's Command training where you see all commands for a specific character you select
[1:31:30] <%MoonxLxght> wow so cool wow
[1:31:30] <greycreeze2345> Now imagine doing the knee 3 times in a row for the full combo
[1:31:30] <%vydos> I thought this streamer was good at video games Kappa (I'm joking please don't ban me lol)
[1:31:31] <%Moosie6768> he throws his hand down and his knee up

[1:34:20] <+Tricky_vfdc> Yes jacky does
[1:34:22] <%SharpsPanda> @thebrogems She's great but she's a hard character to pick up because you gotta learn two characters worth of moves due to Defensive and Offensive  stances
[1:34:22] <%pkhero64> Yea I’m learning her
[1:34:27] <+gambinozerk> Why the character don't have ass
[1:34:27] <%AltimaOG> Jacky is pretty simple. Every since VF2. Sweeps for days.
[1:34:28] <%The_Vengeful> I saw Tricky giving Tasty Steve the beats with Eileen
[1:34:28] <HyperSonicX99> Eileen before Lucky Chloe

[1:34:34] <+tulliusciceroiv> trying to learn Aoi and Jesus christ most of her move set is counters
[1:34:36] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> Does Jacky still use optic blasts for one of his winposes and yell "MY NAME IS JACKY BRYANT"?
[1:34:39] <%Tristar49> kara cancel?
[1:34:43] <%PFlare> ***
[1:34:43] <%SpongeBobSquareEnix> @abielpadilla thx dood!
[1:34:44] <yomanomn> How hard is this game? can't wait to try out
[1:34:44] <dyingficus> eileen w1ith lag is horror.
[1:34:46] <%OlivePowerRanger> Vanessa, Shun, Akira, Goh classify as hard characters
[1:34:47] <+K9Player> @Maximilian_DOOD Jackie has a no-input counter if done correcntly
[1:34:50] <ChaosImpact> Yeah, his faint can be delay so that Jacky can pull back his leg after a hit
[1:34:50] <%SpongeBobSquareEnix> @RofflessLWK thank you! <3
[1:34:52] <%majikel1989> Jacky is simple compare to others
[1:34:54] <%VZLABoi> @PFlare Only mods can post links in the chatroom, Twitch autoremoves links posted by anyone else
[1:34:55] <+Tricky_vfdc> Jacky does have to do that to get good
[1:34:56] <%Ssoto02> Ssoto02 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Maximilian_DOOD's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[1:34:57] <+stormhowl_fgc> @Maximilian_DOOD Thats just for optimal damage combos, he can get by without it kinda
[1:34:57] <%Ssoto02> Ssoto02 gifted a Tier 1 sub to azndrifter720! 
[1:34:57] <+WuMingi> iaigeri is like Jacky electric wind god fist
[1:34:58] <@shinkuhadoken1> You need it to do best combos but Jacky can just do other combos until you master that
[1:35:02] <tacticalnuke002> Eileen is unga bunga monkey girl
[1:35:02] <+GoateeGaming> @maximilian_dood would Wolf or Jeffry be a better pick up for a grappler player?
[1:35:07] <%azndrifter720> @Ssoto02 Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:35:08] <+YungCrusteez> da lab
[1:35:08] <%justicerei> yes, because Aoi is pure Aikido
[1:35:11] <%PFlare> Oh, sorry.
[1:35:11] <raindon> this game has rollback?
[1:35:11] <%identitydisc> I’ve done handcuffed lightning!
[1:35:11] <@shinkuhadoken1> Eileen is best girl
[1:35:12] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> Mai naym is Jecky Bwyan'!
[1:35:14] <%Brunty023> @yomanomn Easy to get into, takes a lot to master at high level
[1:35:14] <+sol_badguy27> @Maximilian_DOOD Make him block and display frame data.
[1:35:14] <%The_Vengeful> Flash sword kick?
[1:35:15] <+TrojanAg> VF is a pretty technical game
[1:35:16] <KalEl001> everyones east compared to akira
[1:35:18] <lutrisss> @Maximilian_DOOD did you see the new PSO2NGS announcement that the game will be releasing june 9th?
[1:35:21] <@Nightbot> Check out NZXT’s newest Starter PC series! An excellent first gaming PC--perfect for school work and working from home while maintaining great gaming performance. Built and shipped within 48 hours with a 2-year warranty. http://nzxt.co/SPC_MaxChat
[1:35:22] <%profoundtaco> How's VF5? I have not seen too much on it
[1:35:22] <divind95> Max: Jacky is easy! Also Max: How the fuck do you do this?
[1:35:23] <elementor374> @yomanomn Easy at surface level, but difficult to master
[1:35:23] <%MitchEnigma> as soon as the kick hits press g
[1:35:24] <%justicerei> not the Kazama knockoff
[1:35:25] <%kalmlyhere> Did he get it besides the one he missed with Akira?
[1:35:25] <%MadcatMK6> So this out on PS+, but you can't properly buy it yet?
[1:35:25] <+Tricky_vfdc> 236 K then press G when it connects
[1:35:25] <Doublenyher> he's easy Kappa
[1:35:28] <%VZLABoi> @raindon  nah is an old game
[1:35:29] <+ThisisEubanks> @Maximilian_DOOD press g right when it lands
[1:35:29] <+HeLooksAngry> he auto-catches mid punches, right?
[1:35:29] <+stormhowl_fgc> @Maximilian_DOOD Hold 6 then K, G just before hit
[1:35:29] <%impoolse> you have to press g on the frame it hits
[1:35:31] <QuincyPwns> push G right as its active
[1:35:31] <%fancyfantasy> GO TO COMMAND TRAINING OMG
[1:35:32] <@HurtboxTV> you can do 236K and hit G when the kick hits @Maximilian_DOOD otherwise is hold forwarg K:G
[1:35:33] <%predac0n> but....that's just  Paul with a different haircut
[1:35:34] <SwindleDF> Who are beginner friendly characters in VF5?
[1:35:34] <%SharpsPanda> @GoateeGaming Wolf can do the Diamond Cutter and Goldbergs finisher. He's really cool
[1:35:39] <%TheWordPlay> I believe it's G right before hit?
[1:35:40] <8mmspikes> @lutrisss check his twitter dood
[1:35:43] <%uffduh80> fuzzys are what i need to learn @Maximilian_DOOD BADLY
[1:35:45] <@shinkuhadoken1> Press guard to pull the kick back
[1:35:45] <%MoonxLxght> take me back
[1:35:48] <raindon> thank you
[1:35:49] <+billy_deez> both wolf and jeffrey are great 4 grapplers
[1:35:50] <NaughtyJuri> Jackie & Sarah look beautiful in DOA5LR I'm happy VF is back
[1:35:51] <oge543> @GoateeGaming Definitely Wolf. Jeffrey is more of a brawler, he has a lot of good strikes. Wolf has a ton of damaging throws
[1:35:55] <%The_Vengeful> 6(hold) K,G on impact
[1:35:56] <%megido_flame> fsk
[1:35:57] <@HurtboxTV> you can do 236K and hit G when the kick hits @Maximilian_DOOD otherwise is hold forwarg K:G
[1:35:59] <+WuMingi> there you go
[1:35:59] <+Tricky_vfdc> you did it
[1:36:00] <%IMDRanged> Did Virtua Fighter ever get a live action movie like Tekken?
[1:36:01] <elementor374> Damn
[1:36:01] <gunstars20> SPEED
[1:36:04] <valokiteshvara> I have a feeling the load times on my launch ps4 won't be quite so snappy lol
[1:36:05] <+Owltosser> @SwindleDF Pai imo. Good mixups and normals, fairly simple strings
[1:36:11] <Javek1908> safer too
[1:36:13] <Rawrsong> @SwindleDF  Jackie, Sarah, Eileen, and Goh are pretty good starters
[1:36:13] <@shinkuhadoken1> That was it
[1:36:14] <+sol_badguy27> That kick cancelled on block is +3, shit's insane.
[1:36:17] <%HawkGoggles2> lightning kick
[1:36:18] <hujkull> @SwindleDF pai, lau , brrad , jeffry , jackyy , jean
[1:36:18] <+HeLooksAngry> so keep him from switching lead foot
[1:36:19] <%OlivePowerRanger> @swindledf jacky, sarah, lau, jeffry, pai

[1:36:23] <+billy_deez> jackys a stud with that hair haha
[1:36:24] <%BrokemanJ> Can you learn multi characters or is it better to just stick to one character instead?
[1:36:24] <%stardustdood> he goes YAH when you do it too
[1:36:25] <Camaleonte07> Im a Wolf main now
[1:36:26] <+Xxatlsfinestxx> combo filler
[1:36:29] <+Tricky_vfdc> that move is so annoying.

[1:36:32] <%The_Vengeful> Safe launcher
[1:36:32] <+TheNeutralGame> this one dude really likes talking about command training every 45 seconds, it may be his fetish, don't go there please
[1:36:33] <+GoateeGaming> @sharpspanda yeah I saw he could do Diamond cutter, jackhammer, F5, tiger driver, etc but I know jeffry has some grappling plus he can strike
[1:36:34] <+WuMingi> it's a 16f high NH launcher that's +3 on block
[1:36:35] <tatsu00> The back+forward P+ K thing with Jean is murdering my hands
[1:36:36] <@shinkuhadoken1> It’s fast and gives ++++
[1:36:38] <%MitchEnigma> hes amazing for wall juggles in DOA 5
[1:36:39] <+Owltosser> @Rawrsong Goh? You absolute mad man LUL
[1:36:41] <%SharpsPanda> Wolf also has untechable throws but they do low damage
[1:36:43] <+Resignedbc18> see when this game has percise inputs like that we need rollback netcode
[1:36:44] <%BananaTheBread> @Thepuddingfighter Yes... LUL

[1:37:27] <%Thorn14> I wish I could learn Stick but just cannot
[1:37:28] <%Dwang> @predac0n Yes, Kage has some insane moves in FS/US
[1:37:28] <%FatAlfonso> you get to SLAP those buttons and it sounds so nice
[1:37:30] <Sach3tb> Virtua Fighter plays better on both Stick and Keyboard also hitbox\
[1:37:30] <DonTinchone> and on controller you use dpad or joystick?
[1:37:30] <+billy_deez> the game is under new games on ps4

[1:37:41] <%Bazal68k> @xenocraigmorph Thank you for the giftsub! doodGood
[1:37:42] <skewerstar> is it just me or does it look like there's 2 dlc slots on the character select screen?
[1:37:42] <tatsu00> I need a new controller cause I have mine drift
[1:37:42] <+Tevvy> hitboxes are fun as hell to play on too
[1:37:44] <+weadoe> stop asking if stick is better chat! you do you!
[1:37:44] <+Biohazard724> Jacky looks like the long lost 3rd Son of Sparda
[1:37:44] <%Dakuu75> oh ok. he was like "Stick isn't necessary anymore" then goes onto say "-but, they're more fun" XD

[1:37:47] <%issun_boushi> Fighting on stick is like piloting a mech irl
[1:37:47] <+Sorradude> i bought my first stick a couple months ago and i never looked back, so fun
[1:37:47] <Camaleonte07> WOLF

[1:37:52] <%Jflaskd13> @lutrisss yes, he retweeted it
[1:37:54] <%Darnell16player> I play SFV on stick and it feels right to mee
[1:37:56] <%Darnell16player> *me
[1:37:57] <LeoSageTV> he's not edgy at all
[1:37:58] <%Brunty023> @Alfina I've been good. Prepping for a job interview tomorrow
[1:37:58] <%BananaTheBread> @Thepuddingfighter You saw that you can even stop mid kick when he was pressing G early, so if you see you're able to wiff you can just cancel completely LUL
[1:37:59] <%HeyKooolaid> chat the razer raion is the best way to get both feels
[1:37:59] <+Xxatlsfinestxx> i'd get a hitbox/mixbox instead of a fight stick if just starting out easier to learn if you aren't used to holding a stick
[1:38:00] <dscarface07> this soundtrack is 🔥SourPls
[1:38:00] <+crabblegs> What system is this on?
[1:38:02] <+sinrin> I'm a hitbox main
[1:38:03] <%deathspit00> I play on stick.
[1:38:03] <Javek1908> I want to try a hitbox but don't have the free funds to spend on something just for fun like that
[1:38:04] <Raykis> @maximilian_dood Are pressure sensitive inputs still in this version?
[1:38:07] <kora766> keypad and hitbox tho.
[1:38:08] <%MoonxLxght> skill floor is fairly low, but the ceiling is to the moon and past that
[1:38:09] <@Alfina> @Weevensteven @retrozaid @OmegaZeroX2 Friends drgrHug much love! how are you all hehe it's so wonderful seeing u all! missed ya hehe
[1:38:09] <%TokenBlackDood> those horses are scared stiff
[1:38:10] <%TheWordPlay> I've played on controllers for years, but they hurt. Switched to a stick and it's easier on my hands
[1:38:10] <HyperSonicX99> But I love my controller (I’ll try the stick one day)
[1:38:11] <%Thorn14> I just can't do motions, I need to use my thumb
[1:38:13] <+RaptorsAUS> i got my first stick a month ago. i now have tennis elbow... i went too hard too early...
[1:38:13] <+SinkingWings> But what about a hitbox?
[1:38:13] <%Kalzassa> @Alfina Just woke up from el nap happythoSleepy how are you today? notkohHug
[1:38:15] <%identitydisc> Give em the stick. DONT GIVE HIM THE STICK!
[1:38:17] <DarKaoZ> but for tournament events is definitely more comfortable to take a dpad imo
[1:38:18] <+Tricky_vfdc> remember weight combos are a thing. So wolf combos are a little different
[1:38:19] <%Bazal68k> @Maximilian_DOOD Any impressions on a Saturn style pad yet?

[1:38:20] <%stardustdood> @Alfina Great to hear you're doing well
[1:38:20] <FrostedZaibatsu> My thumb was literally breaking from pad. So i HAD to switch to stick
[1:38:21] <+Mewgusta> I like controller  tiffosZeldaShrug
[1:38:22] <dragonpunchclub> 6p+k wall slams too
[1:38:23] <%SharpsPanda> @GoateeGaming He can do a pretty easy combo and do silly damage so he has a little bit of both. But play who ever you think looks cool :D
[1:38:23] <+dementedcactus> do combo
[1:38:25] <Chaosmaster8753> is it me, or are regular fingers better at button presses than just your thumb?
[1:38:25] <%PotatoBaconBomb> Stick just feels good, most stick movements feel way better than controller to me
[1:38:25] <lividmask> Stick doesn't leave my left thumb raw af
[1:38:28] <%Soluix> Sound is still weird in this game.
[1:38:28] <elementor374> @crabblegs PS4 exclusive BUT you can play it on PS5 too

[1:40:04] <+sol_badguy27> Some moves are considered CH if you get hit while backdashing
[1:40:04] <@Alfina> @VZLABoi Hewwo love comfyScuffedHug how are you? its wonderful to see u hehe

[1:40:11] <%Dradawn> Duck and weave!
[1:40:11] <+Owltosser> there is backdash, and crouching dash, but don't think it's like korean backdash
[1:40:12] <@Alfina> @retrozaid comfyHeart
[1:40:12] <cellohwell> Back back down-back back
[1:40:12] <+WuMingi> @maximilian_dood the difference in this it takes a lot longer to cancel, and you eat a counter hit to backdash and can't cancel it to blocking
[1:40:13] <%MoonxLxght> hell ya
[1:40:13] <@HurtboxTV> So dashing has recovery frames you can't block for a few frames after a backdash. Side stepping while not evading also has recovery frames. @Maximilian_DOOD
[1:40:14] <kamen_itachi> like korean backdash?
[1:40:14] <TrashLeviathan> hell yea KBD time
[1:40:14] <%Setsuna_GN> Only difference i see is that in tekken, its a back dash crouch back dash

[1:52:18] <Supercoolmike> pk thunder? Kappa
[1:52:20] <akbar_0> is this game officially released or is this only early access for influencers? i can't find it on the playstore.
[1:52:21] <%betamax_tapes> betamax_tapes subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! 
[1:52:23] <NrgSpoon> pkg is the proper evade
[1:52:28] <%Darnell16player> @alfina well I got 2 weeks off of work since the team is on the road now
[1:52:32] <+ClementineDoggo> Anyone know what song this is?
[1:52:37] <%sho00per> doodSad i dont understand
[1:52:39] <%switch_treamer> pk THUNDER
[1:52:39] <%MisterVFDC> offesnvie move IS NOT an evade
[1:52:39] <SwindleDF> Pk fIRe Kappa
[1:52:41] <@shinkuhadoken1> No no, max u were right
[1:52:42] <BoredmanDA> so that explains why Fighting Vipers and Sonic the Fighters do that
[1:52:46] <+Yuso_> @akbar_0 I had to search for it on the store to find it
[1:52:46] <%MisterVFDC> is a tool for side pressure
[1:52:47] <DNICE3838> @akbar_0  its in new games on store
[1:52:47] <%Otoshi_Gami> yeah chat. Learn from max :p
[1:52:48] <mrdude2u> Sweet beat Dural.
[1:52:48] <%jakangg> @NemesisPrimus  night dood yyjCozy doodShine doodShine doodShine doodShine
[1:52:49] <+WuMingi> @maximilian_dood the normal sidestep with 2/8 is defensive move which evades. Offensive move does NOT evade.
[1:52:49] <%B1itz90> i just did that tutorial its not that intuitive at first
[1:52:50] <%FlapNasty3> @maximilian_dood yo, this music is freaking FYRE!!!
[1:52:50] <PeronSouls> Chat did you  see the new game " TWO STRIKES" ?
[1:52:52] <%sae_what> its like Jin's quick dash
[1:52:52] <%KraftyMattKraft> @maximilian_dood PKG is NOT defensive
[1:52:53] <+Tricky_vfdc> no it's a different mechanic. sidestep is just evading. offensive move is a way to go to the side when you have frame advantage. It's diferent
[1:52:54] <@Alfina> @Darnell16player ksixYay
[1:52:54] <@shinkuhadoken1> OM doesn’t actually dodge tho
[1:52:55] <%HawkGoggles2> it's not even twice you just need to press up once
[1:52:57] <+stormhowl_fgc> @Maximilian_DOOD 2_8P+K+G doesn't evade, its just for repositioning
[1:52:57] <Pk_chaos> Pk me
[1:53:01] <Honda_Ryderz> just downloaded VF5 :D
[1:53:04] <%switch_treamer> PK FIRE 🔥
[1:53:05] <%Adwark> @akbar_0 People have been already finding it on store, Simmons has downloaded it as PS Plus subscriber without influencer early access code
[1:53:05] <+Resignedbc18> its not a evade its a way to get away from edages corners
[1:53:07] <%NurseLee> Offensive move is just for position not to evade
[1:53:08] <+billy_deez> u have to go 2 new games in ps4 store. i couldnt find it b4 earlier
[1:53:08] <Sach3tb> G+P+K IS OFFENSIVE EVADE
[1:53:11] <%OmegaZeroX2> @akbar_0 you can find it on PSN by searching up Ultimate Showdown
[1:53:13] <@shinkuhadoken1> Phew
[1:53:16] <%indifference84> It's in the tutorial
[1:53:20] <%MisterVFDC> it's something you do when the opponent turtles and you want a better offensive position
[1:53:24] <+Tricky_vfdc> so after you OM then do 3K right away
[1:53:27] <%lorgami> laynaSip
[1:53:29] <+WuMingi> offensive move has 0 evasion.
[1:53:32] <%OmegaFatalis> you don't need to up, up or down, down just one input
[1:53:34] <KentF0> Tapping up or down once sidesteps, dodges attacks and breaks attack tracking.  Following it with PKG is  only repositioning and re-enables tracking.
[1:53:34] <@Alfina> comfySip
[1:53:35] <%OgGeek2016> It's in tutorial for those who want to learn in chat
[1:53:36] <pakumen02> This thing have an iceberg of layers
[1:53:38] <@shinkuhadoken1> Yes u had it right before - OM is so u can position and hit someone in their side for a phat combo
[1:53:39] <%Nattlig> doodwesker
[1:53:42] <%UndeservingKonomichan> abbaOwO I rather learn from the doggo El Chorizo
[1:53:45] <%Dubiyus> Simmons' chat rules are just annoying.
[1:53:49] <zzz_nuke> Does anyone know how to make the cpu in training to stop following me?
[1:53:54] <dragonpunchclub> Attacking from side changes frame data for the better
[1:53:57] <+TheGoblinsGuide> Its just a single tap up or down to sidestep
[1:53:58] <DarKaoZ> if you time the side step with a attack you can activate it. sidestep+PKG is to do it manually
[1:54:09] <+Tricky_vfdc> you will see the hit spark be blue when y ou hit from the side with 3k
[1:54:11] <+ultradmann> Do you ever get tilted playing fighting games?
[1:54:21] <%MrMidLife> Wolf used to have kidneys
[1:54:25] <%KraftyMattKraft> @maximilian_dood You will KNOW when you do a defensive evade. it feels and looks different

[1:55:09] <bagoosh> lots of layers

[1:55:29] <NrgSpoon> i really do love the way the characters getting hit sell the moves
[1:55:31] <+WuMingi> you cancel the charge of PKP into K
[1:55:33] <@shinkuhadoken1> OM >3k soon as u can
[1:55:39] <%Darnell16player> @mrmidlife so true
[1:55:39] <ZanyJ4> @maximilian_dood how does Jean in low poly look
[1:55:43] <SDSakuragi> since this is dragon engine, what are the chances of getting majima or kiryu as dlc characters?
[1:55:45] <%xvapelord69x> @MrMidLife youd be shocked how easily older gamers get pissed
[1:55:48] <Midelios> the way you can delay the hits in strings in VF is *chef's kiss*
[1:55:54] <%tiredandangry> Second hitttt. Come out to playyyAYYYYY
[1:55:55] <+Tricky_vfdc> make sure to tap G after your butt presses in combos to clear you buffer so you don't get the string if you're not doing one
[1:55:57] <%OmegaZeroX2> @alfina SilverHeadpat
[1:55:58] <%OmegaFatalis> @mrdude2u yeah it's weird they don't even let you play her in offline versus or training like VF5FS
[1:56:00] <%xvapelord69x> kinda the opposite when u got no time and u gettin smoked
[1:56:01] <NrgSpoon> kiryu: 0%
[1:56:03] <%KraftyMattKraft> @maximilian_dood and gang. off to bed. have a good nite. see you in the ring.
[1:56:08] <@shinkuhadoken1> That’s right
[1:56:10] <allmoneyin212> Will he be going online wit this tonight
[1:56:10] <+WuMingi> @maximilian_dood OM setups are great after e.g. you CH with 66P
[1:56:11] <benjaq12> Max, did you like Brad Burns?
[1:56:14] <Novinworks> See if you can invite LaAkira to join you! @maximilian_dood
[1:56:17] <+Ice_ArchAngel> @MrMidLife Well said
[1:56:22] <+dojima_az> how's the net play feel? is it as good as I remember it?
[1:56:27] <Carquar> @SDSakuragi At least a slim chance of Majima. Definitely not Kiryu though
[1:56:31] <+billy_deez> just practice and take a loss as a loss lol
[1:56:31] <@shinkuhadoken1> This game has sooooooooo much depth
[1:56:31] <+Tricky_vfdc> so you will cancel the third punch into K .
[1:56:32] <ludrah007> there movemnet less floaty now
[1:56:32] <elementor374> @sdsakuragi Low. Kiryu doesn't hit women, Majima uses a kinfe and no VF characters use a weapon
[1:56:35] <skewerstar> Ichiban for VF? SeemsGood
[1:56:37] <DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood also if they block most of the charge attacks you can break their guard after they block the charge attack then you press K or P, but I leads to combo
[1:56:38] <%wizchiefa23> danComfy
[1:56:38] <+Zunahme> Wolf has no booty
[1:56:41] <%MrMidLife> @xvapelord69x I'm probably one of them.   I didn't I didn't get tilted, I'm just too old to do it lol :)
[1:56:45] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Jesus, I see so many on my list playing VF.
[1:56:46] <Midelios> yeah so p g p g p g to poke with p to not get the string right?

[1:57:16] <tatsu00> Hold P then press K
[1:57:16] <sappinmahbinyot> @sdsakuragi I'm willing to bet very low. What i think is really likely is that VF6 gets announced within the next year and Majima, based on thug/dancer styles, gets in as a guest in it.
[1:57:17] <@shinkuhadoken1> While holding that last p you press k

[2:10:56] <dovahkin2697> taka is a noob killer
[2:10:58] <REDLAYTEE> Really like the cage fighting background
[2:10:58] <DNICE3838> i got the bundle with dlc for $30 tok supports devs hard work n love this game
[2:10:59] <+worldwarriortv> @Maximilian_DOOD is this free for ps plus?
[2:10:59] <%SwiftNeoX4> @mistervfdc I'm worried that the technical nature of VF will scare people away
[2:11:00] <lordlord07> @Viewtifulotaku7 i have a defibrillator in hand , in case you die today, don't worry about it Kappa
[2:11:01] <%Gigazord> Lets go you v me @maximilian_dood

[2:11:29] <+KingZai> chat did max play online at all yet?
[2:11:29] <Novinworks> If SEGA means esports, then events and DLCs can carry out this game. Hopefully 3-5 years till VF6.

[2:11:37] <%MisterVFDC> @SwiftNeoX4 that's not what scares people. Non active games scares people away. If the game is tecnical but fun and alive, people will stay
[2:11:38] <%MrMidLife> My PS+ subscription is patchy, so I don't feel like buying it down the line when I'm not playing online so much.
[2:11:41] <+ArtsyFoxo> It's kinda frustrating tbh. Because it should be common sense that releasing a game like this on PC would be the best way to get it out. Sega cmonnnn FeelsBadMan
[2:11:41] <coolshadow_21> For the legendary pack says around 2000 customization items? Theres that much character customization in this?
[2:11:41] <%SwiftNeoX4> @worldwarriortv yeah its free on plus

[2:12:45] <%LuiiLIVE> this game looks like a more arcadey tekken.
[2:12:47] <GeltonZ> @NOVINworks Would be if they hadn't removed so many customization items. There's barely anything here and they took out skintone options so I can't make Vanessa darker.
[2:12:48] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> To anyone in the chat: Does Vanessa have her original appearance as a costume, even if only as DLC?
[2:12:48] <@Alfina> @DarKaoZ comfyHeart thanks love hehe

[2:12:50] <%Cobaltios> @ArtsyFoxo To be fair, this is a remaster of a pre-existing game, so I'm not sure if a PC port would happen unless there's enough demand.

[2:13:51] <DarKaoZ> @alfina of course, ones well being is the most important
[2:13:55] <+ArtsyFoxo> @Cobaltios I get that, but since most fighting games tend to have a PC release. I feel like throwing it out there would be a better investment. As well as a better way to get the name out there
[2:13:55] <GeltonZ> @NOVINworks Oh I intend to but like...there's not even a skintone OPTION like there was in the old days! I feel so ripped off.
[2:14:01] <@shinkuhadoken1> 2k has a string
[2:14:05] <%VZLABoi> @plague_koala Please read the rules of Max's Channel. Rule #6: Don't beg for gift subs.

[2:14:26] <GeltonZ> @coolshadow_21 There's not. They're REALLY streaching the numbers. They took OUT most of the customization. There's barely anything here.
[2:14:28] <%MisterVFDC> or as punish
[2:14:31] <dionisispargi> hello from greece dood
[2:14:36] <%Lbeeztv> @LuiiLIVE yeah VERY sure, this game is alot more technical than Tekken, Tekken was always the more juggle heavy Arcade version of this game
[2:14:36] <+Dead_Paranoia> @vzlaboi rule #1 same
[2:14:39] <@Alfina> @justcleve_ I'm glad you're hanging in there comfyHeart stay safe too pls hehe comfyScuffedHug I'm doing quite well love comfyOwO danke for asking.

[2:14:58] <@shinkuhadoken1> Ya but if you you 2k after 66p you get that string
[2:14:58] <Novinworks> @geltonz Im pretty sure Sega can add things over time. They got plans.

[2:16:22] <GeltonZ> @coolshadow_21 Yeah they're all super restrictive pallet swaps.
[2:16:27] <journeymanapprentice> daytona car is on fighting viper not virtua fighter Jebaited
[2:16:28] <reepusart> is the game out now?
[2:16:28] <Denzel_Snipes> This game in its new form is definitely a testing ground for Sega to gauge interest, support, and basically decide if there's gonna be a VF6 down the road. At the very least it'll reach a huge audience and tide people over until such future plans, at very little risk to the company. Pretty brilliant strategy, this release.
[2:16:29] <dragonpunchclub> Every charge is plus mostly
[2:16:29] <Novinworks> @geltonz The business blueprint is there. by TEKKEN 7. DLCs, free contents, events and this game can last longer than previous entries (fingers crossed)
[2:16:30] <@Alfina> @Universal_Bojack Ooo limesPoggers I never even heard of the lemon cheesecake, I bet that delicious.
[2:16:31] <%Solid_Stro> @viewtifulotaku7 How’s it going Viewtiful, you plan on playing this too? doodBro c4sageHey 2020ByeGuys sabert14Box

[2:16:53] <%mamabowsette> is max practicing?
[2:16:54] <GeltonZ> @MrMidLife You could in the original and it's very necessary since they whitewashed Vanessa in this game so you need the Tropical Tan to get her old skintone back.
[2:17:03] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @mamabowsette Yes
[2:17:05] <@shinkuhadoken1> 4pp charge
[2:17:05] <%VZLABoi> @reepusart  at least in the US, I think someone from Canada said it was out there too
[2:17:06] <%noctis2341> @reepusart yes
[2:17:08] <+WuMingi> P jabs are usually +2 on block
[2:17:12] <+Bariman98> I'm learning real fast that you CANNOT mash inputs in this game. Moves will come out wrong, if at all

[2:17:58] <%MrMidLife> I don't agree with what they did to Vanessa either, but times have changed since 2008.
[2:18:01] <%MightySandwich> You match the direction
[2:18:01] <Kyllaruna> Is every charge move of this char a guard crush?

[2:18:23] <%LuiiLIVE> @Lbeeztv yeah... Why does a bear make it arcadey??? That doesn't make sense my guy, that just makes the game goofy. I am talking about how shit LOOKS and SOUNDS.

[2:18:47] <+CHEETO_TAXES> Throws will always get beaten by normals though
[2:18:49] <@shinkuhadoken1> It’s easier when you know the character throw cuz u know what they want to do
[2:18:53] <%Tricky_vfdc> that throw also sets up great oki
[2:18:53] <GeltonZ> @MrMidLife "Times have changed"?! So we can just take away customization options because making a black woman black is racist now! What kind of screwed up world do we live in.

[2:19:25] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood put the character to block and try to do the follow-up for his charge attacks
[2:19:25] <%justcleve_> @darkaoz no prob doodBro
[2:19:26] <+stormhowl_fgc> 46K+G
[2:19:26] <helixidron> luckily, the roster isn't as big as T7s, so more feasible to learn all the characters
[2:19:28] <%MisterVFDC> 46K+G
[2:19:31] <+WuMingi> 46K+G
[2:19:34] <+descend3r> lol no way Virtua fighter gives arcade vibes

[2:19:47] <%Lbeeztv> @Maximilian_DOOD not sure if it changed from VF5 to FS but u can also input multiple throws inputs during throw techs
[2:19:47] <%mrgooey_> @geltonz Why so adamant about that here???
[2:19:48] <%MarKellZC> I agree with ya, I haven't played much of virtua fighter, but i'm practicing now and learning vanessa! markel6Laughingsarah
[2:19:54] <%ToraWrathUwU> doodDerp
[2:19:56] <%BananaTheBread> @helixidron The issue is the characters are so much deeper LUL
[2:19:57] <%DarKaoZ> 46KG > 6K
[2:19:58] <%LuiiLIVE> @Lbeeztv yo the talk was fun
[2:20:00] <deafmelone> @geltonz I get it dude, I miss vf4 Vanessa too lol
[2:20:01] <+WuMingi> iirc nothing is guaranteed if they recover from stagger fast enough
[2:20:06] <Novinworks> 46K+G is great
[2:20:13] <%Solid_Stro> @torawrathuwu doodDrool sabert14Sip

[2:20:50] <jukebox2014> Ohh man that roll kick
[2:20:52] <%yourunclebuddy> Is that safe on block?
[2:20:54] <helixidron> oh, whoops, no, don't listen to me, idk this game
[2:20:54] <Novinworks> @geltonz They will add it. Dont worry. I think VF team has periodical plan for releasing contents not to have the game die quickly. But to keep it going like TEKKEN 7. Patience=virtue ^^
[2:20:59] <%FrosTKoi> how good side step in this game?
[2:21:01] <GeltonZ> @mrgooey_ Vanessa is my favorite VF character and every game they've ruined her harder and harder. I'm a sucker for character customization so removing customization options pisses me off. Especially since I just paid $10 just for them.
[2:21:05] <+WuMingi> roll is safe yes
[2:21:06] <@Alfina> @Viewtifulotaku7 oathHmm
[2:21:09] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @dionisispargi He will play it when he wants. Otherwise not likely because netcode sucks.
[2:21:09] <@Alfina> @dionisispargi comfyBap
[2:21:11] <%krystalcute91> jean's pose looks like jojo pose lol doodLUL
[2:21:15] <hujkull> @yourunclebuddy yup
[2:21:18] <@shinkuhadoken1> @frostkoi ridiculously good - the game was built on it
[2:21:18] <+Sticky80sbaby> with the character designs weren't so...meh
[2:21:21] <vfsozos> This game is about sidestep
[2:21:22] <8_drunken_gods> in the octagon
[2:21:26] <%Lbeeztv> @LuiiLIVE I actually like Tekken but as someone who plays both I feel there is more movement, offensive, and defensive options in VF
[2:21:27] <@Alfina> @ULTRA__64 Naisuuu! zentreHug
[2:21:27] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Alfina Not my fault people don't know.
[2:21:28] <%yourunclebuddy> Shit.. lol

[2:21:38] <%AzathothWrath> Is Goh newbie friendly? I love his design so much
[2:21:39] <+WuMingi> if you do 6K after and they recover from stagger then you die
[2:21:43] <Valucca99> is this a mod ?
[2:21:44] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Sebastian19321 No.
[2:21:45] <elementor374> So chat, is the netcode good?
[2:21:47] <chrono_dono> you think that vf will be in evo? @maximilian_dood
[2:21:47] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood put the character to block and try to do the follow-up for his charge attacks they lead to combo specially K
[2:21:47] <%Lbeeztv> @LuiiLIVE Both games are good though
[2:21:47] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Valucca99 No.
[2:21:56] <%ToraWrathUwU> @viewtifulotaku7 doodDrool doodDerp
[2:22:00] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> So if one wants dark-skinned polygonal Vanessa, they should get VF4 Evolution on PS2, right?
[2:22:01] <%Solid_Stro> @krystalcute91 You should see his win poses too sabert14Sip
[2:22:01] <69HentaiLoli420> so rollback o no rollback?
[2:22:06] <@shinkuhadoken1> Yes @azathothwrath GOH can definitely be played by new players I love his basic attacks and strings

[2:23:14] <%VZLABoi> @69HentaiLoli420  nah they just reworked the graphics, is still delay based netcode
[2:23:20] <@Viewtifulotaku7> ...
[2:23:21] <@shinkuhadoken1> @maximilian_dood it really starts to come together once you start hitting people in the face and taking more turns with that flow

[2:23:41] <%GG_sensay> i'd like to do that
[2:23:43] <+ZeroAlucard> im thinking of kairi from sf ex
[2:23:48] <%DarKaoZ> Charge attacks are great with Jean, because it's his mind game and can break guard if blocked with the follow-ups
[2:23:49] <%unCTRLd> doodTaco
[2:23:52] <%LuiiLIVE> no cool designs... There's just no way to invest myself into it.
[2:23:54] <%Bullmance> Do you know about delaying his punches for mix?

[2:24:56] <Novinworks> Its ok to be a casual VF player. Its ok to be a semi pro VF player. Its ok to be a pro VF player. There’s all kind of play-styles. Just find/make friends with those who you love to play with and grow together!

[2:46:50] <%DarKaoZ> 3P is a good ground fast hit
[2:46:52] <Endlessfin> Absorbing black hole netcode
[2:46:52] <HyperSonicX99> He looks like Old Ocelot
[2:46:53] <jimbean711> Online looks good from small sample
[2:46:55] <AstralAbstraction> it was always "virtua" fighter
[2:46:55] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @rommaler1 Not really.
[2:46:56] <skewerstar> wtf was that a hellsweep!?
[2:46:59] <+noelle_______> @Maximilian_DOOD I think lau has a guard break monkaS
[2:47:00] <zzz_nuke> i gotta get use to blocking with a button in a 3d game
[2:47:02] <%SamuraiPoet88> @Solid_Stro Howdy distH distH distH distH
[2:47:04] <combatjohnny> Any button config recommendations for VF5?
[2:47:05] <%HazzardousEco> That move must be a guard crush
[2:47:06] <%OmegaZeroX2> @leon_tekashi Ah I see I see mom0kaThonk
[2:47:13] <@Leon_Tekashi> But yeah, that's definitely Luizprower. One of the OG let players I feel.
[2:47:13] <@Viewtifulotaku7> The netcode is much different compared to Strive and it's use of Rollback.
[2:47:17] <taimuu> @rommaler1 nah not on par with strive, long distance connections have a ton of delay
[2:47:17] <+Skadisson> Lau with his DOA moves
[2:47:20] <%UltimateRedFire> yo the music slaps.
[2:47:21] <@Leon_Tekashi> Back when I thought having 10k was a lot.
[2:47:23] <hujkull> Roll max
[2:47:23] <%OmegaFatalis> this is the afterlife for broken sound systems

[2:47:29] <HazeRed> the Lau-lilulelo
[2:47:29] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Skadisson Lau isn't in DoA
[2:47:30] <%Frizen_101> @Metalgaiden96 the people saying it looks old don't know what it is and the people saying it looks good is because they know what it is
[2:47:31] <ryukenchi> yeah can be pretty quick

[2:48:01] <%Cobaltios> SEGA's using some crazy black magic for the connections, apparently.

[2:48:11] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @rommaler1 I understand that, but I believe these are more based on lobbies and not a pier to pier connection like rollback.

[2:49:41] <@Nightbot> The Virtua Fighter series is a long standing 3D fighting game that started back in 1993 and is widely known as the 1st of it's kind and has set the grounds for numerous other 3D fighting games that follow after.

[2:49:58] <%HazzardousEco> I still love the impact sounds of VF =D
[2:49:59] <FluffyMikeB> Low parry exists. ;)
[2:50:01] <+Nettacki> In lore, the main “villain” so to speak is the organization J6

[3:02:37] <%Adwark> @fly_xcur that server would absorb bad connection of other player giving you better experience even if other player connection has issues. but that's just a guess
[3:02:39] <%memburberry> search passcode
[3:02:40] <%Fly_Xcur> @zev111 that's because Tekken was originally based off vf
[3:02:40] <lordlord07> all the music in this game is good, wtf ?
[3:02:40] <Endlessfin> Absorb netcode > rollback netcode ?
[3:02:42] <%titanium_kyle> @Brunty023 the closest we hve is Abigail in SF5 with his VROOM VROOMs LUL
[3:02:43] <%ReKalibrate> @superkamiiguru hold that direction. charge or croutch
[3:02:46] <timorales43> @fly_xcur supposedly they're using delay based netcode but peeps at SEGA are trying to sell it as a better version of delay saying it "absorbs" the delay, aka he's bullshitting
[3:02:48] <%SquallAdv> @Harrason it's like an improved delay netcode using google servers around the world, kinda like parsec, it works really well
[3:02:48] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> I was 8 when VF5 first came out in the arcades, and 9 when it hit the PS3.

[3:39:44] <%zefitz> if its not p2p based than you're screwed if you're not close to the server location
[3:39:44] <%aurice_heartly> @Maximilian_DOOD you plan to check out the FF7 First Soldier Beta?
[3:39:44] <Canadianbacon384> Difficulty of Virtua fighter compared to other fighters i.e Street fighter or Tekken?

[3:40:25] <%Adwark> @supasnupak00pa Max himself was hype for PSO2NG but he's bit in weird place because on 8th comes Guilty Gear Strive and on 10th comes Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrade meaning he has no time for proper dive into any of those LUL

[3:48:41] <+Skadisson> 🤘 naroDX this theme
[3:48:44] <@HurtboxTV> You can't sidestep freely in this game like tekken. if you're not evading a move your sidestep has recovery frames.

[3:48:57] <OsirisLee629> edgiest fighters on edgiest map
[3:49:00] <+WuMingi> start by playing 2D. Once you find situations that seem that don't have an answer to them - evading is one option to try :)
[3:49:02] <%HongChina> Doesnt the game have an audio cue for most spin attacks? That woosh sound?
[3:49:04] <+Jericothe1> that one jin throw lol

[3:50:20] <%OmegaFatalis> This man was molded by the lag
[3:50:28] <ozorha> characters looks so heavy
[3:50:31] <%ReKalibrate> its usually consistent delay tho so you can adjust to it from what i've played.
[3:50:33] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @superunhappyman There are a few grab centric characters.
[3:50:34] <%SeanmanderPlays> LUL
[3:50:35] <skrskrr99> wait, wazwuz is from indonesia i think

[3:50:37] <%Kitsune826> raised by it
[3:50:41] <Novehz> theres no stuttering at least
[3:50:41] <saudipunk97> the stage looks colder than my city rn
[3:50:41] <%HiddenBoss> i guess for the most part the "Blitz" has been pretty decent?
[3:50:44] <%Lcknes> those dragging punches and kicks look dope
[3:50:46] <%thewb32018> WOW
[3:50:47] <Canadianbacon384> When is Sega adding Sonic?

[3:51:01] <+Skadisson> naroSalute gg
[3:51:02] <+smackthenun> what is this game on a scale of dead or alive to tekken?
[3:51:02] <%Bedskirts> what do you call that hairline
[3:51:03] <plague_koala> more punches and fake kicks then go for the grab @maximilian_dood
[3:51:07] <%BananaTheBread> Kenny delayed or less?
[3:51:08] <piggalicious> delay BASED netcode
[3:51:09] <+SartoriusKryzzt> I had the same problem just now

[3:51:26] <+Madgamer099> Imagine having no rollback in 2021
[3:51:26] <%Kitsune826> it seems to be muuuch much better than soul calibur's netcode
[3:51:27] <+WuMingi> DOA is more based on VF than Tekken

[3:51:32] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @smackthenun Pretty much its own game.
[3:51:33] <mrdude2u> He may have adapted the lag but that guy was molded by it. LUL
[3:51:34] <pixel_river> VF has a lot of standing still is what i noticed compared to tekken atleast
[3:51:37] <FluffyMikeB> Yes, there are lobbies. But this is ranked.
[3:51:39] <DJ_Silenze> Any Rage Quits yet?
[3:51:43] <%machine_head> @WiseWTF in kof
[3:51:47] <%DarKaoZ> Nice! that blocked charge attack K followup you can do a short combo, if you can test it out in training! 😄

[3:52:28] <+Jericothe1> yeah its def dead or akken. very clearly inspired doa and tekken said eh mobility lets take that out
[3:52:30] <vietboiandrew> that was a sick counter
[3:52:31] <+albirV> I guess SEGA saw how EX Layer looked and they took it personally Kappa

[3:52:56] <+WuMingi> there's exact recovery which is hard timing, and then normal recovery after that. Some things must be avoided with exact.

[4:03:25] <ArcanaTheFoolX> that guy was in the matrix
[4:03:26] <bryllun> Tekken gets mods by the dozen. It's time to mod VF5 .
[4:03:26] <%DrunkenDice> VF or die! lacDed
[4:03:27] <%frunkiebrewster> his sega Saturn was a dedicated VF machine

[4:03:37] <+naceros> itazan
[4:03:37] <%MrMidLife> @Maximilian_DOOD that's the scary part.  The game came back for us.  It never left for the hardcores.
[4:03:37] <Insignificant_Cat> VF is that damn good, why play other fighting games?
[4:03:37] <+JINXHAND> @Maximilian_DOOD I play everything except bbtag lol
[4:03:38] <%jsf_zack> ahh more glowy shiy
[4:03:39] <GilsoV> It DOES look like a specialist`s game
[4:03:44] <frosty_frozon> what is fk is that costume??
[4:03:45] <EQtheWolf> downloaded the game but it wont launch. Anybody having this problem?
[4:03:50] <anarchistPastry> Sonic The HedgePog

[4:03:53] <%JuniperWizardHasan> HE WAS A SK8R BOI
[4:03:53] <tacticalnuke002> That's Relius from BlazBlue
[4:03:57] <HOUSEOFWIL> if you're 3rd dan+ lights are mandatory
[4:03:58] <alonso2892> Lion , is that you Lei wulong xd?
[4:04:00] <rayhaku808> DoA is pretty similar in that regard
[4:04:01] <Qu3nty_> Scuffed Vega
[4:04:03] <+WuMingi> it's a vocalion
[4:04:06] <%Dakuu75> Do most fighting-game "skills" transfer from one to the other or is timming and everything so different it's always pretty-new?
[4:04:08] <%fletchrr> Skateboarder Loen
[4:04:08] <Baritone_Baphomet> @yunggoon1 is actually pretty fun.
[4:04:09] <hujkull> block low vs lion and launch with knee

[4:04:19] <kaudera> so how's the absorb netcode Sega's using? lol
[4:04:20] <DogeMadeMeRich> yeah DOA is the same @rayhaku808
[4:04:22] <+Dead_Paranoia> hes always had that costume since 3
[4:04:26] <XandRV> Is this light a  strat? Why is everyone using it? LUL
[4:04:30] <Keihart> Lion, do not confuse with Leo
[4:04:34] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> Don't forget that blocks in VF become like mini Nitaku situations if your opponent doesn't fuzzy guard.
[4:04:34] <HazeRed> it's so he can skate away from KNUCKLEHEADS
[4:04:34] <+WuMingi> Lion is praying mantis kungfu which Lei does not have
[4:04:34] <xdill0x> Its SonicFox's brother PogChamp
[4:04:34] <Progearspec> Lion simmons can't stand him ;)
[4:04:38] <XIII_Kazu> I think that man fought Simmons before.. mybe Im wrong.
[4:04:39] <%Lily_Valentine> I remember back in the 90s, I thought his name was Leon, not Lion. LUL

[4:04:44] <vietboiandrew> sonic
[4:04:46] <WolfenHeiger> bad call
[4:04:52] <NrgSpoon> some people just want to max out the customization options
[4:04:57] <hydration2o> how many buttons is it ?
[4:05:00] <%fletchrr> @Lily_Valentine It IS Leon Kappa
[4:05:02] <%DgenOnyx> like you said in your last vid, the only to get good is to play the  Shiet of it.... loll
[4:05:07] <bryllun> I hope DOA doesn't die out. I hate for it to simmer down like VF.
[4:05:10] <Baritone_Baphomet> DOA needs good netcode and better PR. I'm a DOA vet but I play plenty of other fighting games.
[4:05:11] <%Samurai_Jake> sup chat

[4:05:14] <DragonDDark> How's the online?
[4:05:16] <ArcanaTheFoolX> How's the netcode Max?
[4:05:22] <strawhatsamurai03> Nice
[4:05:22] <+天使42199> @dakuu75 generally basic concepts like footsies and frame data, movement can follow. but it depends on the game as well. Many games have a lot of their own mechanic to adjust to, 3d games have sidestepping to worry about vs 2d games etc

[4:06:07] <%Lily_Valentine> We better see this game at EVO.
[4:06:08] <Andigaming> no rollback in 2021 WutFace
[4:06:10] <%LocalAlienParty> what's max's connection match set to? good or best matches?
[4:06:10] <%frunkiebrewster> Absorbed delay lol
[4:06:11] <%IstyFunkist> The Rollback God has spoken doodDerp
[4:06:14] <%titanium_kyle> theres Delay-based, theres Rollback, now theres ABSORB NETCODE
[4:06:15] <vietboiandrew> @decoymanta its free on playstation
[4:06:15] <kaudera> ah so it's better than average delay
[4:06:16] <Gardenolva> A Kujo?
[4:06:19] <andviceversa_> This guy made Lion looks cool
[4:06:20] <@Nightbot> Watch our YoVideogames stream archives on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/yovideogames
[4:06:21] <+smackthenun> helena is good damn
[4:06:21] <Baritone_Baphomet> @decoymanta kinda shitty how the devs treated it
[4:06:22] <DSD24> I miss DOA as well
[4:06:25] <Gundroog> Without proper test even this "absorption" netcode feeling good but not reflect how actually good it is
[4:06:25] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @hydration2o The depth is in the gameplay. Don't be fooled by the control scheme. LUL
[4:06:26] <%SquallAdv> ABSORB netcode Kreygasm
[4:06:30] <+SpectorShade> @decoymanta I hope the next one goes for a normal release instead of the KI approach
[4:06:30] <FluffyMikeB> The most involved I ever got into competitive gaming was DOA2 Ultimate.
[4:06:31] <%wizchiefa23> Ppl just feel some way about it although the doc was excessive
[4:06:33] <%Bedskirts> I see Sonic TonyHawk'sProskater is playing tonight
[4:06:34] <%Samurai_Jake> Samurai_Jake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Happy to finally be subbed
[4:06:35] <tylovetx> it's crazy how these players just download you.
[4:06:35] <+Frizen_101> @DecoyManta didn't 6 come out last year? What do you mean you miss it LUL
[4:06:36] <ChaosImpact> Blast Processed Delay LUL
[4:06:39] <%taigoman> Maybe there's rollback in Virtua Fighter 6, if this does great
[4:06:45] <ricardoismydad23> Its still delay tho
[4:06:48] <%RofflessLWK> DoA is definitely alive..... in the form of Venus Vacation. Kappa
[4:06:49] <%LocalAlienParty> and just like that, max has outranked me LUL
[4:06:49] <melowap> oh no i think brother to the rescue in controller
[4:06:50] <+jonny879> doa is a fun game, shame people don't give it a chance
[4:06:53] <%SuperKamiiGuru> What did you do to anger these players Max
[4:06:53] <%Samurai_Jake> doodOK doodOK doodOK
[4:06:57] <@Sol_Install> how the absorb feeling tho max
[4:06:58] <Gundroog> Like people were saying Tekken netcode was "great" after the patch thanks to confirmation bias. Same with SFV netcode patch.
[4:06:58] <PuddingFighter_> the server thing is interesting though, wonder if it would make rollback perform even better, if it did have it
[4:07:01] <Baritone_Baphomet> They literally just used DOA as a DLC cashcow
[4:07:04] <+Nayeonim> DoA is shadowed by the weebs thirst
[4:07:04] <vietboiandrew> pro players tonight
[4:07:08] <hydration2o> @SteveEnglishStereotypeFox oh how does it compare to tekken 7 ?
[4:07:09] <bryllun> @jonny879 exactly
[4:07:10] <%DecoyManta> I know there's a DOA now, I just want one that actually has some effort/thought put in
[4:07:10] <ArcanaTheFoolX> Absorb Netcode sounds like some kinf of Tampon name

[4:07:54] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @hydration2o Tekken is my main game, but VF blows it out of the water. Its easily one of the most "deep" fighting games made.
[4:07:55] <%sigmapryme> DOA turned me off once they started putting out $100 season passes
[4:07:57] <+BigOhNotation> @smackthenun DOA beach vollyball was Kreygasm

[4:07:57] <bryllun> @vietboiandrew Speak it to us.
[4:07:58] <Baritone_Baphomet> @nayeonim agreed.  The series has some decent mechanics.
[4:07:59] <%geodood> chat what has max said about the netcode so far?
[4:08:01] <Bishop_BFGC> Is this only availible on PS?

[4:08:26] <WolfenHeiger> changed the opening
[4:08:26] <Spirit_NB> @geodood Decent, but no replacement for rollback
[4:08:30] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @hydration2o Blows it out of the water in terms of complexity anyway
[4:08:32] <mestre221> @cosmicdischarge next week?
[4:08:33] <%DecoyManta> the cash cow mechanics of doa were awful, but there's a legit fun fighting game in there. I really like DOA5
[4:08:33] <elementor374> @cosmicdischarge He knows
[4:08:34] <Bigbotchman> what a knucklehead LUL
[4:08:35] <Harrason> @geodood it's better than whatever most devs use for delay based and some matches are really playable but it's no rollback netcode

[4:08:57] <FluffyMikeB> Give credit to DOA for having their joke character actually win a tournament in cannon (Zack in DOA3)

[4:09:49] <MrBREEKY> this would be even better with rollback!, its still very good but its still the same 360  game with better graphics imo
[4:09:51] <%Brunty023> @justachap As a fellow Aussie, I would assume it would be real bad
[4:09:55] <+Deathspate> Can that light be disabled? That shit isn't helpful

[4:10:58] <%DecoyManta> @SpectorShade right? They had a great mix of styles in there and doa5 didn't have a terrible story mode
[4:11:00] <fIashman92> Customization depends on the base, right?
[4:11:01] <$Buffland> golden
[4:11:02] <%Lliimbo> @Gardenolva What are you trying to accomplish? If it's just have fun, I was able to learn a handful of BnBs and pokes in a couple hours and am already having fun in ranked.

[4:11:08] <%Lily_Valentine> @Maximilian_DOOD Looks like you need the glow bracelet too. Seems to increase everyone's power.
[4:11:09] <+Deathspate> @Brunty023 bruh, that shit screws my eyes, it's a comp advantage imo
[4:11:12] <%MisterMukkey> @MrBREEKY that would cost a ton of money and they'd most likely have to rebuild the game all over again. let's just be thankful this exists and its free
[4:11:13] <Insignificant_Cat> LOL, haven't the hands in VF games always been a bit weird looking tho?

[4:11:17] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood if you pick other outfit you get other options
[4:11:19] <leavemeglazzies> Brad Burns has some nice customization options.
[4:11:20] <hydration2o> @SteveEnglishStereotypeFox PC unfortunately  could you give me an example on how complexity manifests it self in this game?
[4:11:22] <+MikuruX> Yeah, the base determines the customizations
[4:11:22] <+Quazington> i bought the dlc and i cant access customization? strange
[4:11:23] <Dan_The_Noob> yeah SEGA, let people make shreks with huge d***s
[4:11:24] <neroblind88> dlc
[4:11:24] <bryllun> Can I mod the Cobra Kai gi for Jean 'cause I want it.
[4:11:25] <%Bloodninja15> Tournament
[4:11:25] <KainTravesty> Yeah needs more gear maaan!
[4:11:27] <%MikeyJC> Doesn't the base you choose change the options you get?
[4:11:28] <%Lliimbo> It's Tournament mode
[4:11:29] <vietboiandrew> hopefully they add more customizing things
[4:11:29] <AmmoniaWasp> its tournament mode @Maximilian_DOOD the preparing
[4:11:30] <MuuvStehpah> It says Tournament
[4:11:31] <%HongChina> @akbar_0 i can see it on PSN website, $30
[4:11:31] <EtherNigh> i think it is the tournament mode
[4:11:32] <%loveselfloveall> @altair3333 hmmm HahaThink I see
[4:11:32] <%Brunty023> Soon, we'll have our Shibas back on our backs! LUL
[4:11:32] <Spirit_NB> probably tournament mode
[4:11:33] <raman_7991> simmons has made a room
[4:11:33] <%YellowYoshi1> It says Tournament
[4:11:34] <%Bedskirts> really like how you can live spectate on the main menu
[4:11:35] <%Bholorak> there is a 10 bucks dlc for costumization, did you get that?
[4:11:37] <greycreeze2345> Looks like Tournament mode
[4:11:37] <+Bariman98> Tournament
[4:11:37] <yuriyin> Tournament mode maybe
[4:11:38] <MrFireTom> Battle royal

[4:11:53] <%DgenOnyx> @Maximilian_DOOD im new to the fighting world.. been a fan for years i got power rangers n stv5 because of you so tysm
[4:11:54] <Baritone_Baphomet> Though I doubt it, I sincerely hope DOA is able to make a comeback. The series doesn't deserve the flak it gets from the fgc
[4:11:55] <masterp1e> make him look like ken ?
[4:11:58] <%RofflessLWK> @Bholorak Yeah he has it
[4:11:59] <neroblind88> ooh
[4:12:00] <+MikuruX> The game is missing a lot of stuff from Final Showdown
[4:12:04] <%DecoyManta> are you committed to Jean?
[4:12:08] <+superdevon_> it's in room matches as well
[4:12:12] <%taigoman> The game is out at least in the EU PSN Store. Just search for "virtua" and you should find it fine.
[4:12:12] <%Samurai_Jake> I'm excited to pop this game open  after work
[4:12:12] <Vulcan422> More customizations will likely be DLC later on like in Final Showdown, there are at least 3 costumes per character that are missing right now
[4:12:15] <%Brunty023> @Sorrowful_Suicide Same! One day, it'll come back!
[4:12:17] <%DarKaoZ> @bholorak well he has the VF1 outfits, so I assume he does
[4:12:17] <saudipunk97> monkaS
[4:12:17] <+SpectorShade> @decoymanta I always liked Hayabusa but when one of my friends got into DoA I realized that I liked Christie and Bayman a lot

[4:12:27] <DSD24> The Brad SHOW
[4:12:33] <%Billiesan> they have to remake it all
[4:12:34] <amestan> Quest mode was good in VF4 evo
[4:12:38] <%MadcatMK6> To be fair though, the game is only $30.
[4:12:40] <bryllun> Brad has drip.
[4:12:44] <50schmeckels> dude they used thhe voice from fist of the north star for Jean!!!
[4:12:45] <%TheSaltminer> he's burning TICKETS TO THE BRAD SHOW
[4:12:45] <KainTravesty> Hell of a show

[4:12:50] <%YellowYoshi1> Brad can you hear me? BRAD?!
[4:13:02] <goldbuttcheeks> EZ
[4:13:04] <deadstar3017> What is missing from final showdown
[4:13:07] <%RofflessLWK> @abaddonic Agreed, I've watched my older brother play quite a lot of DOA back in the day, so I have sort of a soft spot for it haha. Hopefully it makes a great comeback one day~
[4:13:08] <%AmuroNT1> Chatroom, I have tweeted Max the monkey paw emote cirBox I hope he sees it
[4:13:09] <PuddingFighter_> This is probably one of the best looking stages, the background is actually animated

[4:13:49] <ControlTheCrowd> @vietboiandrew Naaaah LUL
[4:13:54] <HiQKEY> 😂😂
[4:13:54] <%DecoyManta> @SpectorShade I went between Hayabusa and Jahn Lee a lot. A lot of the characters were great until they stopped caring about move sets and focused on uwu moe aesthetics
[4:13:54] <%Lily_Valentine> @Thepuddingfighter I believe it's a brand new stage. I don't remember it being in the PS3 version.
[4:13:57] <%HongChina> @RofflessLWK I keep hoping to hear about DOA6U but I doubt it'll ever happen
[4:13:59] <KainTravesty> Can you break the gates and fight out in the streets?
[4:14:02] <Yagami2004> VF stages always one of a kind
[4:14:04] <vietboiandrew> 😡
[4:14:04] <bryllun> @artsassin I can't unsee it now.
[4:14:07] <FluffyMikeB> @Artsassin So he's awesome? :P
[4:14:18] <mybrothersco> @Maximilian_DOOD How is the net code?
[4:14:21] <+carlixxo> there is no bars for special attacks on this game?
[4:14:25] <dark_tsukuyomi> Brad? thats just dollar store kiryu LUL
[4:14:25] <レヨメエ> OwO <3
[4:14:25] <%DinoPulseZeta> @Lily_Valentine Well it does have a mysterious Jet Set Radio reference for some reason....
[4:14:26] <ukflexx> Tyler durden brad
[4:14:29] <akbar_0> is the combo system for this game links or cancels?

[4:14:38] <ControlTheCrowd> Daaaamn dat 50% doe
[4:14:39] <Bishop_BFGC> So brad looks like the Steve of VF
[4:14:40] <%MisterTylerrr> So how was Max's meltdown over PSOSNG release date?
[4:14:42] <DSD24> There are no special attacks in Virtua Fighter
[4:14:42] <Mrninjafreak> @carlixxo no
[4:14:42] <DragonDDark> is it free for ps plus now chat? it's not free for me yet
[4:14:48] <%Billiesan> If you pick the other music styles they actually wrote new songs in VF2, VF3 Style for the characters that werent there during those eras.
[4:14:48] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @hydration2o At -1 movement is already an option. Between -1 and -5 fuzzy guarding is your main option where you can wave dash to avoid highs and stand to block mids in time. Past -6 is a nitaku situation where you have to guess if its going to be a throw (10f), high (12f), mid (14f) or low. Then you've got different hit types, homing states, throw types and all sorts. The core mechanics are utilised differently by each character. Each character has a different weight and falls different etc.
[4:14:51] <%SnipingMonkey> What a combo monkaS @Maximilian_DOOD
[4:14:53] <%Brunty023> @carlixxo No super moves or special moves whatsoever. Just raw fighting
[4:14:55] <%Onyx_13k> @carlixxo There is no thing such as supers in this game, only raw combat
[4:14:56] <vietboiandrew> @dragonddark yes

[4:16:33] <Baritone_Baphomet> @maximilian_dood if ya ever find yourself needing fresh content, DOA 6 may be worth going back to.
[4:16:34] <%DgenOnyx> @Maximilian_DOOD when learning a new game does other games carry over???  because i notices youre bringing ki plus street fight over to this
[4:16:40] <%IcyKnuckles> Mad pressure

[4:17:00] <hydration2o> @SteveEnglishStereotypeFox ok that is just amazing enough to get into but hard to master, without the bloat of tekken I hope
[4:17:04] <KainTravesty> I like Sarah. She kicks me real hard.
[4:17:05] <%HongChina> @RofflessLWK Yeah, I feel like Shimbori leaving might have been a major nail in the coffin. If only Koei had kept DLC Hell in the gacha space and not in the actual games.
[4:17:06] <ventoj> Check with low kicks?

[4:17:11] <%titanium_kyle> Steve wants to fight Max now shotoStare doodStare

[4:22:10] <Casual_Steve_> @maximilian_dood Have you tried it on Best Connection yet?
[4:22:11] <Gundroog> @abaddonic The devs tried on launch, what didn't help is AAA price and a fuckload of DLCs with bad netcode and no crossplay

[4:22:39] <Autaki> wait, you can watch other players from the main menu?
[4:22:40] <+Mewgusta> I fought some people in japan and it wasn't that bad
[4:22:43] <%FrancoNero89> absorb is a marketing term?
[4:22:43] <+mr_sir132> The random clips in the main menu are nice
[4:22:45] <@NicoB7700> it was consistent at least
[4:22:45] <sandersplex> Guys, is this Street Fighter?
[4:22:47] <%DecoyManta> @SpectorShade Exactly that. They massively stripped it down. Did the game a huge disservice
[4:22:47] <bryllun> Wait, is this absorb netcode an actual term.
[4:22:49] <Baritone_Baphomet> @gundroog yeah... NotLikeThis
[4:22:54] <cloudyrowdy> how is it compared to tekken?
[4:22:58] <HazeRed> guys is this Tobal No 3?

[4:23:21] <LawlietTK> @cloudyrowdy Tekken has better netcode
[4:23:23] <TioXyco> but then again, 8 frames of delays is preferable over unplayable. could be better, yeah, but...
[4:23:23] <Insignificant_Cat> Yeah, I used to play Vannessa in VF4 :)
[4:23:23] <AkumaYajuu> @bryllun sega called it that, its basically delay using google servers to help connection but if you happen to not be close to the google server you are fucked

[4:23:44] <zezima133> wow
[4:23:45] <%Brunty023> @bryllun Well, Sega says it's "absorb netcode". An even looser term would be "Blitz Netcode"

[4:27:18] <%LemonforceNA> her kick moves look so cool
[4:27:18] <Baritone_Baphomet> @steveenglishstereotypefox True.  I personally don't mind the fanservicey aspects of the game. The SJW types complained and the devs just kinda shrugged it off.  The problem is that they used it as a key marketing tactic
[4:27:18] <%TheKryptonian49> That was a great
[4:27:18] <Gundroog> The new hit effects help a lot to make the game feel less weightless
[4:27:19] <%real_kdubya> sarah is fun

[4:28:09] <%VZLABoi> @LeifArt  well is an old game, redone with a new graphics enging, and some improvements on their delay based netcode, but still a delay based as we can see by how it feels online

[4:31:33] <RagnaXBL> so how ass is the netcode?
[4:31:40] <$QThaGawd> nice
[4:31:42] <+JusticeSoulTuna> Combos SeemsGood
[4:31:43] <%RoachOverlord> SHARK WARS
[4:31:53] <MoraeDev> the netcode is kinda good, but is very depended on where you live
[4:31:54] <%bustahwulf170> Oh hye, she has an Orbital Heel.
[4:31:55] <%DecoyManta> netcode's pretty good
[4:31:58] <+dasmesee> so far everyone's saying good things about the net code
[4:31:58] <%machine_head> @RagnaXBL its decent if youre both in the same country, dreadful if you're far away
[4:31:59] <sandersplex> Is Jean wearing a chasity belt?
[4:31:59] <%VZLABoi> @RagnaXBL  well is among the good delay based netcodes as per Max
[4:32:00] <nappynuisance> @mrkungfugrip its a 33/33/33 tech window
[4:32:01] <%issun_boushi> @RagnaXBL  not bad
[4:32:05] <Mrninjafreak> can vanesser secure the Redfield Bloodline? CrreamAwk
[4:32:07] <Baritone_Baphomet> @ragnaxbl it's good for delay based

[4:32:10] <KainTravesty> Jean is like Devil Jin without the Devil stuff
[4:32:15] <+Owltosser> @RagnaXBL actually alright. Not as good as roll back, but okay
[4:32:16] <CrackMasterK> @RagnaXBL It's good dodgy, 100% comes down to you and them.
[4:32:21] <%DarKaoZ> @ragnaxbl 90% good, 10% bad ATM, but ymmv
[4:32:21] <abysmalphantom0> LUL LUL LUL
[4:32:22] <+天使42199> @ragnaxbl seems to be above average delay based netcode. so it's not that bad but it's not roll back tier. some matches will feel excellent others will feel delayed
[4:32:23] <SwindleDF> @Yoomazir yeah I saw that on the vs screen, I was comparing to like Marduk's Vale Tudo stance from Tekken
[4:32:23] <+EsprPhantomKingRue> Hey chat, does max know that the last soldier beta is up?
[4:32:25] <Kingfried> 4+holding'P+G breaks grabs from left side. 6 for right side.
[4:32:26] <+TenebruhTV> It would not feel good at all. Landing on a belt made of chains

[4:32:43] <zhuravli> Woohooo my vf5 download is completed

[4:32:56] <CrackMasterK> <3
[4:32:58] <robybobycoco> The block sound is so bad... >_<
[4:33:01] <%RofflessLWK> @EsprPhantomKingRue I think he said he's not interested in that after seeing the gameplay, or something along those lines

[4:33:56] <tacticalnuke002> Jojo pose
[4:33:56] <DSD24> A lot of POINT poses in this game
[4:33:58] <%HazzardousEco> Loving that cop outfit on Vanessa LuvBrownL LuvBrownL LuvBrownL LuvBrownL LuvBrownL
[4:33:58] <%MightySandwich> You can escape her throws even after the takedown
[4:34:01] <seaechiowai> doodBigBrain
[4:34:03] <%buff_riku_says> I'm so hype to actually download this game when it becomes free on ps5
[4:34:04] <EtherNigh> Is That a mfking JoJo Reference PogChamp
[4:34:05] <+CJTH3BEAST> That's a JoJo Pose
[4:34:06] <ShaunStyfer> Install the Fear of PArry

[4:34:10] <%GabuFGC> Is jean, ya know HahaShrugLeft
[4:34:11] <+torin_foxglove> Figured Max would have picked Goh Hinogami since he likes Edge Lords
[4:34:12] <+hitbox_royal_rabbit> man seeing this game now makes you realize just how good it was in its era
[4:34:15] <$shwez> lol
[4:34:15] <SmugumiP> "I could not hit her. It's Bullshit. I could not hit her. I could noooot."
[4:34:17] <+mrkungfugrip> lmao taunts
[4:34:21] <GilsoV> "Not at the start" sounds so ominous, hahahaha
[4:34:22] <MuuvStehpah> the ground taunt :D
[4:34:24] <+Askewed_One> @buff_riku_says It should be available
[4:34:25] <+Owltosser> LUL that taunt when she is lying down
[4:34:27] <%DecoyManta> did she taunt you? LUL
[4:34:27] <Kraschong> Could you share some tips for someone never played a VF
[4:34:28] <%bustahwulf170> @tacticalnuke002 I mean, his last name IS "Kujo".
[4:34:31] <%Brunty023> @risorice It comes down to who you play as. Choosing Akira as your first character is a BAD MOVE
[4:34:33] <%MikeyJC> It's a parry
[4:34:34] <%Fly_Xcur> @buff_riku_says pretty sure it's free if you have ps+
[4:34:39] <KainTravesty> Max didn't appreciate that taunt, huh?
[4:34:40] <zer0enixx> Oh hai mark
[4:34:40] <callmeonmycellphone> mount him LUL
[4:34:43] <%coingray> See, what's more relevant, is how is the learning curve?
[4:34:45] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @hitbox_royal_rabbit Shame it wasn't marketed better. Could've been massive I reckon.
[4:34:45] <%danfan915> that taunt lol
[4:34:46] <+masterroshi247> @buff_riku_says It's free right now and out. You have to hit the 3 dots next to the "buy now for $29.99" and select VFUS.
[4:34:46] <%Ruin_HER> is this game good at all?
[4:34:47] <%buff_riku_says> @Askewed_One Right now it's saying 30 bucks
[4:34:47] <%Frizen_101> that punch LUL
[4:34:48] <Yoomazir> intense match
[4:34:49] <WolfenHeiger> went in too hard
[4:34:49] <MoraeDev> It doesnt play like tekken at all honestly, for example there are bunch of safe launchers. The game simply says 'you shouldve evaded that not blocked'
[4:34:51] <HazeRed> save Akira for your 2nd char
[4:34:53] <+Schkadoobens> how's the game? just got here?
[4:34:53] <abysmalphantom0> LUL LUL LUL
[4:34:53] <+tophat_massacre> Sega really does love making that PSO2 sounding OST.
[4:35:01] <+Mewgusta> leta go nessa
[4:35:05] <+hitbox_royal_rabbit> she hittin Max with the old Fabrico Werdum "Get in my guard" taunt
[4:35:10] <OhSoSouls> Is it a parry? I thought her P+K was a parry on the ground
[4:35:12] <Baritone_Baphomet> I'd say blazblue cp was probably the hardest fighting game I've screwed with lol
[4:35:12] <%SquallAdv> @Kraschong Just pick a char you like and keep playing the game <3
[4:35:13] <%RofflessLWK> @buff_riku_says It's free on PS+

[4:35:22] <+Owltosser> LUL that still worked
[4:35:26] <+Askewed_One> @Askewed_One Check to see if there's a way to see the base product. I was having the same problem on my PS5
[4:35:28] <DASH_th> i thought that was jet set radio art in the back
[4:35:30] <%KaranWarpZone> That Jet Set Radio or Knockout City logo on the wall Kappa
[4:35:31] <%wizchiefa23> doodLUL
[4:35:32] <Kingfried> @callmeonmycellphone no, this plays faster than tekken & has no bogus stuff like lowCrushes going under mids & other bogus stuff that would render the battle not 100% on the players part. VF5 is 100% player performance
[4:35:38] <JaxOfSeven> how much of this gameplay is on purpose?
[4:35:41] <%titanium_kyle> that spinning jump punch is the most doodAnime -looking move ive seen in this so far LUL
[4:35:43] <%SquallAdv> @DASH_th it is <3
[4:35:45] <%freshcyborg> What is Max doing do get out of that ground pound? Gotta guess the right button?
[4:35:49] <DSveno_Uguu> that's a sick grab
[4:35:51] <cencalkain> that raw knee
[4:35:52] <LindaStrikes> LUL woe
[4:35:53] <%Brunty023> @DASH_th It is indeed a reference to JSR
[4:35:57] <keroblack2> IMO gameplay wise, fv is in a similar way with doa than tekken
[4:35:58] <%MikeyJC> @OhSoSouls Yeah fairly sure that's the full anim for it
[4:35:59] <%Solid_strife_86> @smugumip Oh hi, Mark

[4:36:42] <+JusticeSoulTuna> ...Am I the only one who really doesn't like comparing games?
[4:36:44] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood qcf+PK is a parry that goes to attack automatically, maybe you want to try it? 🤔

[4:37:08] <saigen7> 🛡
[4:37:09] <MoraeDev> there are bunch of safe launchers as well unlike tekken, cause the game wants you to just evade it or whiff punish it.
[4:37:12] <%superboy2832> doodNuts
[4:37:13] <%issun_boushi> @JusticeSoulTuna  it has its place, but some games are far too different to compare

[4:42:00] <+N2RED> is the net code any good chat?
[4:42:01] <%freshcyborg> @Justlaxy I understand that. Thank you.
[4:42:02] <%Azero_Tehiro> Taka has the best throw game out of the cast.
[4:42:10] <ajapplesauce> What do ya think makes the high level of play so difficult, Max??
[4:42:11] <%AnActualFrog> Soundtrack's a jam holy shit
[4:42:16] <MoraeDev> the system also favors Taka, cause the game somehow has GRAVITY like smash, and he is HEAVY guy.
[4:42:17] <%yeknomlive> cloud vs sephiroth
[4:42:19] <kobura57> When you know the Taka matchup most of the players are free

[4:42:37] <%machine_head> @ajapplesauce the opponent being good at the game
[4:42:37] <%superboy2832> jacky yeah!!!!!
[4:42:38] <VVolfengard> this guy is a tekken player
[4:42:39] <+dreamcastarmor> why cant we choose our sides online????
[4:42:40] <fIashman92> It's a ten year old game. While there is debate, Akira, Jacky, and Taka will always be top
[4:42:40] <DSveno_Uguu> wait time between matches seem pretty short
[4:42:41] <Kobukson> no aoi, shun di, lei fei so far
[4:42:47] <%SquallAdv> damn this stage looks amazing now <3
[4:42:48] <Kingfried> Taka's natural advantage is that he us "un-juggle-able", only bounce combos, so he takes the least damage from other characters
[4:42:55] <Rumpatump> absorb netcode good?
[4:42:58] <%VZLABoi> @N2RED is among the good Delay Based Netcodes, but just that, when is good is good. but can be bad depending on the connection.
[4:43:00] <cencalkain> so im new to this series are there ring outs? on like these stages?
[4:43:10] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @tigerclaws12 It's usually because they're loading interactive stages and things.
[4:43:10] <%RofflessLWK> @N2RED @Misfits_Monkey Max said it's decent, but nothing close to rollback
[4:43:14] <+Takayama_Jin> @cencalkain there is
[4:43:16] <$Juicdei> Literally threw 4 attacks
[4:43:17] <Th3rd3> @cencalkain yep
[4:43:19] <Baritone_Baphomet> @cencalkain yuh
[4:43:19] <fIashman92> Yes, there are riingouts
[4:43:22] <%KaranWarpZone> Yes, you can Ring Out.
[4:43:24] <%VZLABoi> @cencalkain  Yes they are
[4:43:25] <mony_chekz> Billy idol been workin out
[4:43:26] <EtherNigh> @cencalkain yes
[4:43:29] <%SquallAdv> @cencalkain yup, VF introduced ring outs decades ago actually
[4:43:31] <%tenshu_xiv> Wow the music has been really good
[4:43:36] <%DarKaoZ> Taka is playing a different VF when you fight him
[4:43:37] <%Brunty023> @cencalkain There sure are ring outs. Some cases, you can even accidentally ring yourself out!
[4:43:37] <LawlietTK> Yeaaah!!
[4:43:37] <MoraeDev> there is 'gravity' thing like smash, so taka is heavy guy. so you cant get much of juggles off from him. so he basically has way more health than anyone.
[4:43:39] <+dragonjhin> so this game any good then?
[4:43:41] <Progearspec> yeahhhhhhhh
[4:43:41] <vietboiandrew> that was sick
[4:43:42] <%wizchiefa23> At higher ranks these people are good
[4:43:46] <+Ry21Gu> joe
[4:43:48] <+exod444> Is this the classic graphics mode?
[4:43:48] <+X4N_> This guy moves like a Tekken player
[4:43:52] <Flying0ctopus> The music is jamming man
[4:43:53] <abysmalphantom0> LUL
[4:43:54] <RollbackReem> is the music remixed?
[4:43:56] <+dasmesee> beautiful stage
[4:43:57] <$CeeJayOrJustC> Tier lists for this game will be the same as VF5: FS since the gameplay is literally unchanged
[4:44:00] <cencalkain> that's wild im assuming sumo dude has good carry so he can cheese a ring out if needed
[4:44:01] <TigerClaws12> @SteveEnglishStereotypeFox save the initial state in memory and load it? It's not rocket science LUL
[4:44:02] <RagnaXBL> discount benimaru
[4:44:03] <DSveno_Uguu> @dragonjhin VF is fun, but it's not easy
[4:44:05] <Kingfried> you can walk ringout yourself here, real ring out, no invisible borders
[4:44:06] <pixel_river> this feels like a small passion project within sega, they barely got approved
[4:44:06] <Fatal_Fantom> Fatal_Fantom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[4:44:09] <%DarKaoZ> @dragonjhin yeah, try it, is free for PS+

[4:44:15] <fIashman92> He is a VF returnee
[4:44:17] <hollysephiroth> downloaded
[4:44:21] <%VZLABoi> @dragonjhin  well that is a personal opinion so is for you to tell for yourself 🤷

[4:44:29] <%Brunty023> @dragonjhin Easy to get into, difficult to master at high level

[4:44:55] <%Brunty023> @mony_chekz PS4 exclusive, but can be played on PS5
[4:44:55] <+exod444> @LawlietTK It looks like Tekken 5
[4:44:57] <%krystalcute91> @mony_chekz only ps4/5
[4:44:57] <%thewb32018> I got no time for you!

[4:48:14] <Kingfried> @maximilian_dood Jacky's K in his 6PK hitted you because you attacked after dodging the 6P while the following K was coming out & retracked you. Evasion works when acting after your rival's startUp passes.

[4:48:38] <Spirit_NB> I haven't had a Pai mirror tonight
[4:48:44] <$shwez> with those stances? @sae_what i highly doubt it
[4:48:50] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @tigerclaws12 The walls change and break in this game, bro. The walls in GG aren't actually associated with the stage. They're universal edge stage mechanics. They're not tethered to the stage at all. 3D games have to use individual assets for the background. LUL
[4:48:55] <%Cgame_me811> Vanessa looking like Mila doodSweet
[4:48:55] <%Brunty023> @sae_what Vanessa takes a bit to get used to. You're technically learning two characters as her
[4:49:01] <Maxiuuu> for some reason this game looks kinda stiff 🤔
[4:49:07] <Element_XXX> This being free for PlayStation plus 4/5 is awesome
[4:49:16] <+Quazington> its crazy playing Virtua Fighter and being able to find a ranked match.
[4:49:16] <%Lliimbo> @sae_what p sure she has the most moves in the game
[4:49:17] <IIIAxeCopIII> What about PSO?
[4:49:17] <cencalkain> @Cgame_me811 legit what i thought

[4:50:10] <%RofflessLWK> @hassanjabari1 Max has said it's decent
[4:50:11] <%OlivePowerRanger> Vanessa has the second most moves with over 240 but in 2 stances. fucking crazy LUL
[4:50:11] <%Kalzassa> @hassanjabari1 seems quite good for delay based, isn't rollback, but for what it is it's good.

[4:52:39] <+WuMingi> some combos are longer than tekken in this.
[4:52:41] <Element_XXX> Dayum she rolled
[4:52:44] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @tigerclaws12 You can't honestly think it's that simple... You really think that devs wouldn't do that if it was that simple?
[4:52:44] <%MAX116030> @maximilian_dood hi how is netcode so far? want to eat your hand?

[4:52:56] <+exod444> @Owltosser Which are the big 3D fighters? Tekken, Virtua Fighter and?
[4:52:56] <velozen> basically there's nothing particularly remarkable about this game
[4:52:57] <deusmico> i liked the more realistic style of vf compared to sf/mortal kombat
[4:53:01] <%Brunty023> @ULTRA__64 Have a good night Ultra! doodBro doodShine

[4:53:16] <fgc_splash> TIER LIST DONT MATTTER IN VF! U CAN WIN WITH ANY CHARACTER claraaSmile
[4:53:19] <FreeLawX> did somebody call this game simple???
[4:53:20] <%thewb32018> hahaha
[4:53:22] <MoraeDev> VF's perks would be simple button layout, and rock paper scissors neutral between strike evade throw
[4:53:26] <@NicoB7700> Simmons and Kenny are in a room and chatting on discord when you're ready @Maximilian_DOOD
[4:53:28] <+WuMingi> @Maximilian_DOOD you can set the bot to recover from stagger as soon as possible and see what is actually guaranteed or not
[4:53:29] <+wordupq> soul caliber
[4:53:29] <cencalkain> wait the roll kick is a mid WTF
[4:53:29] <drhivesphd> LUL
[4:53:31] <+Owltosser> @exod444 Tekken, Virtua FIghter, Dead or Alive, and SoulCalibur are the ones I'm talking about
[4:53:33] <%RofflessLWK> @ULTRA__64 See ya, take care! doodBro doodBro doodBro doodShine doodShine doodShine
[4:53:33] <tylovetx> the fighting looks more technical than Tekken.
[4:53:35] <%yeknomlive> would that have ringed you out first?
[4:53:35] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood yeah, i used all the time in the PS3 version XD
[4:53:36] <+BlueKen> xDD he fall first
[4:53:37] <+nocontrol80> this game is amazing
[4:53:39] <voil_> I’m enjoying this game sooo much
[4:53:40] <caonimadeb> they can shake out of the stagger
[4:53:41] <HOUSEOFWIL> are there no projectiles in this?
[4:53:43] <DSveno_Uguu> who would call VF simple lol
[4:53:48] <%doritosburger> a game doesn't need to be remarkable to be good or fun
[4:53:52] <TigerClaws12> @SteveEnglishStereotypeFox if arena fighters and indie 3D like Ballistic Fist did it, they can too, they just chose not to for whatever dumb reason
[4:53:52] <+NeviaCh> omg max is drowning  somebody save him!
[4:53:54] <+loco2k> this looks very similair to tekken now
[4:53:54] <Kingfried> @owltosser and..! no bogus random stuff like in most other 3d fighters. VF is the most polished fighting game, always have been 😌
[4:53:54] <+X4N_> Man, I really want to play this, but hate having my games tied behind a pay service
[4:53:55] <Qu3nty_> YOu lost LUL
[4:53:57] <+dasmesee> this game is very entertaining to watch
[4:53:59] <%TokenBlackDood> be sure now to kill yourself from a combo
[4:53:59] <%Frizen_101> @velozity i would say its animations are pretty remarkable. Everything is grounded yet looks insanely cool
[4:54:00] <MoraeDev> simple, just button layout
[4:54:02] <+billy_deez> yea fun
[4:54:04] <%Brunty023> @HOUSEOFWIL Nope. No special or super moves. Just raw fighting
[4:54:10] <neroblind88> it is simple
[4:54:17] <legendaryhero90> lol ggs max good night doods!
[4:54:24] <%bonafye> wait when they released Virtua Fighter 5!?!?!? PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp

[4:54:28] <%LocalAlienParty> @X4N_ you can buy it for $30 to own and it'll come with the dlc as well
[4:54:28] <HOUSEOFWIL> nice @Brunty023  thanks
[4:54:28] <bluerbobo> there's great things in simplicity
[4:54:28] <Insignificant_Cat> @neroblind88 no
[4:54:32] <+wordupq> 3 buttons but game is complex
[4:54:33] <drhivesphd> DANG THEY FALL LIKE ROCKS
[4:54:37] <vietboiandrew> simple if u say so
[4:54:39] <neowave607> I wouldn't say it's more realistic because a ninja does a ficking izuna from 15 feet in the air. I would say it's more grounded/subdued. No flying demon guys shooting lasers out of their eyeballs and shit.
[4:54:40] <+X4N_> @legendaryhero90  gg dude, you are good
[4:54:40] <%jakangg> Bruh playing this damn game is making my wrists sore flynnokEww flynnokTired flynnokTired
[4:54:43] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @tigerclaws12 LUL Oh course. They just chose not to.
[4:54:48] <FlashyFlash> Kage got some unrealistic moves larissaLUL
[4:54:50] <MoraeDev> i hate people talking about realism thing in vf cause NO asf

[4:55:02] <+exod444> Only 3 buttons?
[4:55:03] <velozen> @Frizen_101 different strokes i guess. this looks incredibly boring visually.
[4:55:05] <+Omega_Pyro> Funfact! Did you know WWE wrestler Asuka did some Mocap for this?
[4:55:07] <FreeLawX> kage is litterally a ninja
[4:55:10] <vietboiandrew> the water look realuztic af
[4:55:12] <+X4N_> @LocalAlienParty  But one still has to pay for PS+ to play it since it's an online game
[4:55:12] <%Brunty023> @cencalkain We throw and get hands... and sometimes get an occasional powerbomb! LUL
[4:55:14] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood is after a block charge attack

[4:56:11] <%krystalcute91> @tiffanylockheart yo
[4:56:15] <%Lliimbo> @MoraeDev The fights obv aren't realistic, but it definitely is the most grounded in reality and martial arts of any fighting game
[4:56:18] <ControlTheCrowd> @anacceptablename To support the release yes 👍
[4:56:20] <%VZLABoi> @bonafye 6/1 at midnight Eastern Time, for the US at least
[4:56:21] <Kingfried> the "realism" part comes in the amount & quality of animations & how the game flow works through it. Not realistic as in emulating an MMA combat.
[4:56:22] <%Cgame_me811> @exod444 Yes
[4:56:27] <@TiffanyLockheart> tiffosSoraWave @drhivesphd @Brunty023 @thewb32018 @RofflessLWK @krystalcute91
[4:56:40] <MoraeDev> like no one does Jean's building height jump smash irl
[4:56:40] <caonimadeb> learn the guard break
[4:56:42] <tacticalnuke002> Menu scrolling complementing the bgm
[4:56:43] <Baritone_Baphomet> @lliimbo I can agree with that.
[4:56:43] <+Omega_Pyro> @tylovetx She didn't say, unfortunately.

[4:57:12] <caonimadeb> b f p+k stuff
[4:57:15] <shikimagura> You coulda just said the animation is fluid andnhot realistic
[4:57:23] <%AzathothWrath> Is Jean full charge go through guard? monkaS
[4:57:27] <MoraeDev> ^
[4:57:30] <Baritone_Baphomet> @anthlon good for delay based netcode
[4:57:32] <%krystalcute91> @exod444 ps5 controller
[4:57:40] <%RofflessLWK> @Anthlon Max has said it's decent! :D
[4:57:58] <%john_fullsauce> this music slaps
[4:57:59] <%TokenBlackDood> @anthlon ok. Great for delayed base but not as good as rollback
[4:57:59] <ControlTheCrowd> Show SEGA some love and let them know we love them bringing things back SeemsGood <3 SeemsGood <3
[4:58:01] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood BTW 3KG has way more range than it looks like
[4:58:09] <+Owltosser> damn did everyone log off?
[4:58:10] <%MadcatMK6> Have they said anything about a proper PS5 optimization patch for this?
[4:58:14] <%Myloe> CatJAM
[4:58:14] <Anthlon> @abaddonic @RofflessLWK that's good to hear, hoping to play a bit later on tonight
[4:58:16] <%MarKellZC> markel6Laughingsarah
[4:58:18] <MoraeDev> tekken focuses on highlighted keyframes, so the moves tend to look super wonky or unrealistic asf, or certain keyframe is super janky like mishimas hellsweep
[4:58:19] <cencalkain> I'm just glad the game has good netcode
[4:58:21] <+nocontrol80> bless sega
[4:58:22] <Wiiplayah43> @shikimagura I mean, they mocapped martial artists. That's as realistic as it gets.
[4:58:23] <%SquallAdv> VF is so fun to play ^^
[4:58:24] <%DDC20XL> DDC20XL converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[4:58:34] <vietboiandrew> vs chat Pog

[4:58:41] <Qu3nty_> @ControlTheCrowd Time fo Virtual On then <3
[4:58:44] <%BaronBattle> for some reason theres no invite
[4:58:48] <%indifference84> you're the 7th ranked Jean in N America
[4:58:49] <@TiffanyLockheart> Average at best netcode.
[4:58:52] <%RofflessLWK> @Anthlon Nice! Hope you have a good time with it! And also a good experience with the online haha. doodGood doodBro
[4:58:53] <fIashman92> Is it at least better than DBZ?
[4:58:57] <MoraeDev> but it does have nice animation, just different style. while VF does some very fluid animation
[4:58:58] <%MarKellZC> Played 3 hours of this game, I’ve been digging it markel6Laughingsarah
[4:58:59] <Baritone_Baphomet> I'm so hyped for guilty gear. The rollback actually allows me to enjoy the damn game.
[4:59:00] <%AzathothWrath> compare to SF?
[4:59:00] <%Brunty023> @ControlTheCrowd Hell yeah! SEGA needs to bring back JSR (though we're getting Bomb Rush Cyberfunk to fill that gap) and Crazy Taxi!
[4:59:00] <RollbackReem> @maximilian_dood better than fighterz and tekken netcode?
[4:59:10] <%Vrogarth> hi max doodHey doodHey doodHey
[4:59:10] <TigerClaws12> pat posted a meme saying it's "apartheid netcode" LUL
[4:59:17] <%SoldarAngelus> def felt delayed button presses in some of my matches...but the overall experience was not bad. Still had fun matches
[4:59:20] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Being better than Tekken netcode ain't hard.
[4:59:21] <%HiroesX81> a good starting point to build on hopefully netcode
[4:59:27] <ControlTheCrowd> @qu3nty_ LUL SeemsGood HELL YEAH
[4:59:31] <rayhaku808> really? no kapp?
[4:59:31] <+X4N_> Is it possibly the best delay based there has been?
[4:59:34] <vietboiandrew> het ur vf games up there a lobby VoHiYo
[4:59:44] <+SartoriusKryzzt> This game's online is pretty good imo. It just has matches where my inputs aren't coming out on time
[4:59:44] <RollbackReem> I love how fighterz is the standard for bad delay based netcode
[4:59:45] <%BankingPancakes> Is it better than SFV lol
[4:59:50] <voil_> I'm really curious.. how can a delay based netcode be better than another
[4:59:51] <%DarKaoZ> @viewtifulotaku7 shot fire LUL LUL
[4:59:55] <Mr_HAMato_YOshi> chivalry grind
[4:59:56] <Baritone_Baphomet> Tekken net code is asssssss
[4:59:59] <tonytrash76> Hi
[5:00:05] <cencalkain> god fighterz netcode hurts me
[5:00:05] <RAH001> its delay base netcode but not delay your will to live base netcode. if you know what i mean
[5:00:10] <MoraeDev> and what i think about perks in VF are, 1. super simple button layout as it uses only 3 buttons. 2. very fast paced close range scramble thanks to evade
[5:00:10] <@TiffanyLockheart> I have faith in him. LUL
[5:00:15] <RollbackReem> tekken netcode is terrible
[5:00:20] <%krystalcute91> absode netcode
[5:00:20] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> @viewtifulotaku7 Unfortunately true. BibleThump
[5:00:20] <Kraschong> Don't forget Tekken has rollback Kappa
[5:00:22] <@NicoB7700> btw, did you see you could change the UI to the old VF games? @Maximilian_DOOD
[5:00:23] <MunsterrTV> how is sponge netcode
[5:00:25] <%AzathothWrath> Tekken is fun offline but online? damn
[5:00:25] <vietboiandrew> he probably kno
[5:00:26] <Flying0ctopus> Tekken's netcode is the greatest of all time in Harada's dreams.
[5:00:27] <+Phoxx_3D> A B S O R B
[5:00:33] <%diggusx> Why can't they just get parsec built into their games
[5:00:34] <%Kalzassa> @Maximilian_DOOD I'm trying to get him there
[5:00:35] <@TiffanyLockheart> Aye morning to you! @NicoB7700 tiffosSoraWave
[5:00:36] <%memburberry> any chance you think we'll see VF6 if this successful enough?
[5:00:40] <@NicoB7700> it's super cool
[5:00:46] <%OmegaZeroX2> @rollbackreem probably because it's one of the most popular but their is worse out there
[5:00:47] <Wiiplayah43> @voil_ The same way any type of program can be better than another of that same type.
[5:00:48] <%thewb32018> Steeb is going to Steeb doodSteve doodSteve doodSteve

[5:00:55] <RollbackReem> harada really think tekken has rollback LUL
[5:01:02] <+SartoriusKryzzt> They nerfed character customizations

[5:01:22] <ReziuS> Tekken does have rollback, it's just shitty rollback
[5:01:25] <funkytobi> @diggusx parcel just don't work without optic fiber
[5:01:29] <ChaosImpact> appearnantly the game use Google relay
[5:01:30] <MunsterrTV> when we playing strive again Max I need more Leo practice
[5:01:32] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @MikeyJC Because Sega knows how to make good music.
[5:01:35] <%ToastyHorde> Is that Sephiroth Jebaited
[5:01:36] <%majorbashir2> absorb net code
[5:01:37] <jarl_thickdog> why sega do this
[5:01:38] <jpkun9902> Steve is teady
[5:01:39] <@DashXero> Just got in. How's the netcode treating Max?
[5:01:39] <Shino_B_Gaming> Bruh it is good
[5:01:39] <DSveno_Uguu> good old lobby music
[5:01:40] <@TiffanyLockheart> Knowing Sony's track record lately, I wouldn't say thats a far stretch for a PC port.
[5:01:45] <EtherNigh> they have one year to remake the game chat
[5:01:45] <vietboiandrew> yea sega where pc version
[5:01:45] <Baritone_Baphomet> Extra spongy netcode
[5:01:48] <Autaki> I just noticed this soundtrack is like KOF14's main menu ost
[5:01:48] <%princefatalis> how is the delay based netcode? is it bearable?
[5:01:53] <+CrashTestGremlin> I limit to best connections, in 30 matches I haven't had any problems
[5:01:54] <+Sekhon_98> I wonder if you can do parsec with xcom?
[5:01:56] <cencalkain> i can imagine the mods if this hit pc
[5:01:57] <+Nimbat1OO3> as an aussie i'm not even gonna atempt to play this online
[5:01:58] <MoraeDev> its still delay based in the end, and its SO location dependent as it uses google relay server. which means you have to live where the servers are located to have good connection.
[5:01:58] <voil_> @wiiplayah43 Yeah but it's just strange like what did they do different if it's the same type
[5:02:03] <PuddingFighter_> I just hope this game gives VF a future
[5:02:07] <MunsterrTV> ROLLBACK WHAT ABOUT ROLL FORWARD?????!
[5:02:10] <@DashXero> Ah.
[5:02:10] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Oh boy, let's not go into this.
[5:02:12] <%RofflessLWK> @DashXero He has said it's decent! doodGood
[5:02:14] <+spazzticles> atpRtsd
[5:02:16] <RollbackReem> tekken rollback is like ezra miller flash slow mo sequence of rollback LUL
[5:02:17] <+russ_sp> doesn't find matches? sfv launch vives
[5:02:18] <Last_Shinobi> can you pick the low poly model @Maximilian_DOOD
[5:02:22] <%HongChina> So the netcode tierlist: C->Delay-Based, B-> Absorbcode A-> Rollback, SSS-> BLITZ NETCODE ?
[5:02:25] <%jakangg> Yea this is decent but ehh
[5:02:26] <@TiffanyLockheart> LUL chat
[5:02:27] <TootenTV> I honestly couldn't deal with this games netcode after recently playing a TON of Killer Instinct
[5:02:29] <cencalkain> legit gonna mod jacky into paul
[5:02:30] <%HiroesX81> too late
[5:02:31] <jpkun9902> hopefully VF6 will be a reality with rollback netcode
[5:02:37] <$CloudyCanadian> For me: No PC version = No Play
[5:02:37] <Anthlon> Wasn't there a leak with people finding icons for different platforms on the VF5US website?
[5:02:38] <MunsterrTV> Rollforward Netcode is the FUTURE.
[5:02:40] <%memburberry> then there is skullgirls with like 1 frame delay
[5:02:40] <@DashXero> @RofflessLWK Thanks, dood!
[5:02:42] <seaechiowai> I guess it's bedtime
[5:02:42] <vietboiandrew> rollback talk NotLikeThis
[5:02:43] <MoraeDev> absorb netcode is basically parsec
[5:02:43] <+SartoriusKryzzt> This game is more like "Virtua Fighter All-In-One"
[5:02:43] <%Brunty023> @Nimbat1OO3 Yeah... I hear you on that! I wanna try the online too, but we'll get screwed a bunch
[5:02:45] <ControlTheCrowd> @tiffanylockheart Right LUL LUL
[5:02:46] <+dasmesee> getting sick and tired of the nectcode talk🙄
[5:02:52] <TigerClaws12> ZERO prediction models
[5:02:53] <%AzathothWrath> best netcode is playing in the same console LUL
[5:02:55] <%yeknomlive> like a blitz relay?
[5:02:58] <+PrasF1> better or worse than sfv?
[5:03:00] <RollbackReem> whats blitz netcode?
[5:03:01] <%majorbashir2> obsorb net Code is good breh majinoSeshun
[5:03:02] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> Yeah for what it is it's nice, I went in expecting Smash quality online doodLUL
[5:03:02] <Wiiplayah43> @voil_ it'll be very clear if you look into programming fundamentals. There are efficient & inefficient approaches to anything.
[5:03:03] <PuddingFighter_> A Relay server + rollback combo could be pretty neat
[5:03:06] <%SquallAdv> @dasmesee same
[5:03:06] <+gophinobi23> But the netcode is good enough for the game not to die out
[5:03:08] <%princefatalis> guess Sega didn't get the memo on rollback being better
[5:03:09] <Baritone_Baphomet> Anyone know who the DLC characters may be for guilty gear strive for the first season?
[5:03:17] <@TiffanyLockheart> He did it doodSteve
[5:03:18] <%kungfooTitan> i definitely want to hear Keitz and Zinac's take on this.
[5:03:23] <%SquirrelZOD> Half? Being very generous!
[5:03:25] <+Vronning> and the other problem  is that its street fighter 5
[5:03:30] <ControlTheCrowd> LUL LUL LUL
[5:03:34] <%taigoman> How does it compare to Tekken?
[5:03:35] <ChaosImpact> STEEB
[5:03:35] <TootenTV> I honestly don't understand how rollback isn't necessity post coof for fighting games
[5:03:36] <Wiiplayah43> @maximilian_dood would you say the netcode will be tolerable for long-term playing?
[5:03:38] <%titanium_kyle> shotoStare doodBro doodStare
[5:03:38] <+PrasF1> ok so about the same as this except the good matches won't be as good
[5:03:38] <MoraeDev> idk p2p is still best possible form of pc communication
[5:03:39] <%taigoman> Have you tried it?
[5:03:39] <4thcore> Nah SFV is a disgrace in terms of code
[5:03:39] <%majorbashir2> ka1r1Evil
[5:03:39] <Igalimax> if this game is actually using servers. wouldnt that mean it will be come unplayable online if they stop supporting it?
[5:03:40] <RollbackReem> sfv netcode pains me so much
[5:03:40] <+Owltosser> @Vronning LUL
[5:03:41] <fgc_splash> I SAY IS BETTER THAN SFV GlitchCat
[5:03:41] <+JusticeSoulTuna> @dasmesee Same :| I want good netcode for games but it's a tiresome topic
[5:03:44] <%HiroesX81> lets go!
[5:03:45] <+dasmesee> oh my God he uses Akira
[5:03:49] <%ichujun> ofc Steeben uses Akira veiSmug
[5:03:50] <+SartoriusKryzzt> No character select?
[5:03:51] <tylovetx> I wonder why they didn't release this on Switch?
[5:03:54] <seaechiowai> What's better, Jack's Munchie Box or 7-11 Pizza
[5:03:55] <%NativeStardog> @maximilian_dood is the delay too much for twitch rivals??
[5:03:59] <cencalkain> oh these stages look so good
[5:04:06] <%HiroesX81> jyuunen haien daiyo!
[5:04:06] <putridcheese> people still ragging on sfv lol
[5:04:06] <kobura57> Did Max ste the connections on best at least ????
[5:04:10] <%coingray> STEVE....?

[5:04:24] <zezima133> akira
[5:04:24] <MoraeDev> p2p is best form of pc communication, but it might be very unstable depend on their connection, but its on THEIR fault.
[5:04:30] <saffa_nz> the animations in Virtua Fighter have always appealed to me, they seem mostly rooted in actual martial arts
[5:04:34] <%onionh3ad> Ken vs Ryu PogChamp

[5:05:20] <@Nightbot> The Virtua Fighter series is a long standing 3D fighting game that started back in 1993 and is widely known as the 1st of it's kind and has set the grounds for numerous other 3D fighting games that follow after.
[5:05:22] <@Nightbot> Check out NZXT’s newest Starter PC series! An excellent first gaming PC--perfect for school work and working from home while maintaining great gaming performance. Built and shipped within 48 hours with a 2-year warranty. http://nzxt.co/SPC_MaxChat

[5:05:28] <%Brunty023> @DashXero Right? Good views, being able to be cozy under blankets and you get to watch free fights! LUL
[5:05:28] <RollbackReem> does doa6 have rollback chat?
[5:05:31] <%thewb32018> Virtua Fighter is the 1st 3D fighter technically
[5:05:43] <@DashXero> Yeah! You doods get it!
[5:05:44] <+Owltosser> @saffa_nz I'm not sure about all the fighters, but for Akira the devs actually went to China to interview and video capture a real life baji quan master to get material for the game
[5:05:47] <cencalkain> does the roll only stagger on counter hit?
[5:05:52] <XIII_Kazu> I feel old...  BibleThump sabert14Box
[5:05:52] <%Frizen_101> @RollbackReem no
[5:05:53] <%DarKaoZ> @rollbackreem unfortunately no
[5:05:56] <Baritone_Baphomet> @rollbackreem I wish

[5:06:13] <RollbackReem> dam that sucks
[5:06:13] <HadesCreator> This game looks fun
[5:06:14] <+KayinCR> When's the grand Clayfighters resurgence?
[5:06:16] <MoraeDev> DOA never had good netcode, even as delay netcode
[5:06:16] <+Vronning> waow
[5:06:17] <dethcopter> I thought that was a straight up dick punch at first.

[5:06:40] <Baritone_Baphomet> You'd think they'd be able to afford it considering all the cash they made from dlc
[5:06:42] <%majorbashir2> coxBam
[5:06:42] <Kingfried> @maximilian_dood finding Jeans' i0 techJump would help you a lot.
[5:06:45] <@TiffanyLockheart> ah its custom @Thepuddingfighter
[5:06:47] <+Vronning> any game that isnt made by crapcom is good in my book
[5:06:47] <HOUSEOFWIL> @KayinCR  oooo I would hit clayflighters hard haha
[5:06:50] <%rhuug> rhuug subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! doodGore doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam

[5:06:57] <%ruderobin21> Whats a good beginner friendly character
[5:06:58] <%icloudzero> Yo
[5:07:00] <Wiiplayah43> @hadescreator It is! I think it's better than Tekken 7.
[5:07:02] <randy_lee25> sweet, i'll download it
[5:07:05] <vietboiandrew> im bout to buy this dlc
[5:07:11] <+dasmesee> every stage is beautiful
[5:07:12] <+Owltosser> @Wiiplayah43 yeah and they did this way back in the late 80s, early 90s. Got to appreciate that dedication
[5:07:15] <PuddingFighter_> @TiffanyLockheart i saw it just as i hit send haha
[5:07:17] <%Bedskirts> @ruderobin21 Pei, Kage
[5:07:22] <+Vronning> nice combo
[5:07:25] <DNICE3838> this game is true fighting  n real real  deal
[5:07:25] <seaechiowai> @vronning MaxLOL
[5:07:53] <Kingfried> @ruderobin21 Jacky, Brad, Sarah are pretty simple
[5:07:58] <benloohole> Shouldn't have BAD netcode for ANY genre of games in this age of online gaming. Gaming companies need to step up.
[5:08:00] <@TiffanyLockheart> Just remember chat, if you have PS+ you can also give this game a go.
[5:08:04] <Wiiplayah43> @ruderobin21 I'd say El Blaze. Fun, distinct, combos on movelist aren't too hard.
[5:08:05] <%rhuug> damn this looks so 90s , not that is necessarely a bad thing
[5:08:05] <4thcore> PLUS the models arent huge and unrealistic like tekken
[5:08:05] <+Vronning> hold back to block?
[5:08:08] <RekNYNE> Is there a muay thai character in vf5?
[5:08:14] <%titanium_kyle> !vf5
[5:08:14] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+
[5:08:15] <MoraeDev> every fighting game has its own deal, and VF has super fast paced scramble game thanks to evade
[5:08:15] <FreeLawX> what if Capcom says fuck it and remasters third strike jrkTiger
[5:08:26] <%nova5611> I played a bit earlier and idk why but I just can't get a hang of this game doodTerror doodTerror
[5:08:33] <%Harineto> @reknyne Bruce
[5:08:39] <%Brunty023> @Vronning Nope. Need to press a button to block in VF
[5:08:40] <MuuvStehpah> Isn't Vanessa also Muay Thai
[5:08:41] <%sytch_studio> doodHokey doodHokey
[5:08:45] <+Vronning> imagine making a masterpiece like sf4 and then make sf5 xD
[5:08:45] <ControlTheCrowd> @reknyne Closest is Brad with KickBoxing
[5:08:46] <drhivesphd> JOHNNY BRAVO?
[5:08:47] <%Menkhor> @RakimRevenge remaster? why? its already perfect Kappa
[5:08:51] <DSveno_Uguu> as long as artstyle still the same I'd play third strike
[5:08:51] <MoraeDev> while TK has super movement based neutral games
[5:08:52] <%DarKaoZ> @benloohole Based on what devs say in and out of the industry, online is a pain to implement in anything
[5:08:54] <%jakangg> I gotta take a break or imma fuck up my wrists flynnokLUL flynnokDead
[5:08:54] <4thcore> @nova5611 u cant just play a fg for the first time and master it man....

[5:08:56] <kingcardoda1> hows the connection so far
[5:08:56] <RollbackReem> @rakimrevenge leave 3rd strike alone

[5:10:22] <benloohole> @DarKaoZ Devs lazy talk and you know it

[5:10:24] <its__mono> is it public?
[5:10:24] <%titanium_kyle> @Vronning Akira's shoulder predates Yun's
[5:10:24] <%LocalAlienParty> can you get knocked down a rank in this version?
[5:10:25] <kobura57> Yep Jean has a bounce move to recapture after launcher
[5:10:25] <DSveno_Uguu> dayum that combo
[5:10:27] <Zeronos_and_Co> Ryu and Ken looking good in this new Street Fighter 6 Kappa
[5:10:32] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood after the charge attack been block and doing the K followup do 9KG>33P>K for extra damage
[5:10:33] <+Knecrodragoon> Ok ill take yall word on it. Its got me at least a lil interested so ill most likely try it out. Gonna watch max play some more first though=)

[5:10:58] <cencalkain> why does jean drip swag
[5:11:00] <jasonbowgaming9> Woah you’re good at this game
[5:11:05] <MuuvStehpah> @KayinCR I guess I remember her stances in VF4, it looked very similar to the typical Muay Thai stance
[5:11:06] <kobura57> no
[5:11:09] <Wiiplayah43> Yun Shoulder? As in Tetsuzanko?
[5:11:13] <+Otsgekee> STEEB
[5:11:14] <%thewb32018> Virtua Fighter is the originator chat
[5:11:22] <RollbackReem> is Jean like the Ken or the Iori in terms of lore
[5:11:23] <dwebblec> how's netplay feeling ?
[5:11:27] <MoraeDev> honestly yes pretty a lot similar to DOA since DOA is the copy cat of VF
[5:11:29] <vietboiandrew> bunch of new players to vf5 VoHiYo
[5:11:33] <+WuMingi> yeah Akira has many shoulders
[5:11:35] <%RofflessLWK> Max vs Steve is always hype! doodmaxhype

[5:11:40] <%MikeyJC> Virtua Fighter: Origin Of All Things
[5:11:41] <Kingfried> @rakimrevenge a remastered 3rdStrike with all other SF franchises characters included would be amazing!!! like imagine playing Sagat, Vega, Bison etc in 3rdStrike!? off!
[5:11:41] <$Juicdei> What is this dude doing?
[5:11:44] <fIashman92> Technically that particular style of kung fu is the originator lol
[5:11:53] <%Kalzassa> @dwebblec it's no rollback, but it's good for delay based.
[5:11:58] <+Sekhon_98> @rollbackreem works for a terrorist organization
[5:11:58] <cencalkain> how fluid idoes it feel linking combos?
[5:11:59] <+Otsgekee> I can feel steeb raging
[5:12:00] <tacticalnuke002> @rollbackreem Jean is an assassin and not a heroic character
[5:12:00] <kobura57> VF is different of Tekken and DOA
[5:12:04] <+Euphamia_Isilme> Is this the Yakuza like a dragon version? :P
[5:12:11] <ControlTheCrowd> @dnice3838 Fuck yes SEGA for life SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood <3 <3

[5:12:15] <%rhuug> no offense i thought he was playing a cpu up untill now doodLUL
[5:12:24] <MoraeDev> its a lot different from tekken and somewhat different from doa

[5:12:51] <%GabuFGC> Max Winning - The netplay is great. PogChamp Max Losing - This netplay isn't so good. doodSick  (Purely Satirical)
[5:12:51] <$Juicdei> @rhuug all those big whiffing attacks
[5:12:53] <+Owltosser> @lineRider DOA has holds/reversals for every character, and combos and hit stuns are longer in general. They are similar in that both has the same 3 button input
[5:12:58] <EtherNigh> @theneutralgame Smash Steve Kappa
[5:13:02] <%titanium_kyle> @OuterRaven in VF, yes. Rounds have always been very fast in this game, whether it be due to 30 second timer, damage, or both
[5:13:03] <andesblaz> YOU JUST KILLED AN ASSIST TROTHY FROM SMASH!
[5:13:10] <%thewb32018> Now this is a fighting game doodCrazy
[5:13:10] <DNICE3838> love sega it bring back huge childhood memorys for me
[5:13:15] <slonsteady2> does this game have a KBD?
[5:13:15] <vietboiandrew> hydrate VoHiYo
[5:13:19] <Daldondo> Max took off jean's bra?
[5:13:21] <WolfenHeiger> :)
[5:13:23] <RollbackReem> 2P
[5:13:24] <+baconforce> punch and kick
[5:13:25] <%Kalzassa> @dwebblec it is, but east to west coast US seems quite good. Max played someone in Asia and was rough, but playable.
[5:13:28] <kobura57> Learn combo
[5:13:31] <+le_kinkss> does this game has hard combos, a lot of inputs to know ? or its easy to learn ?
[5:13:33] <OuterRaven> @titanium_kyle I see, thank you for the answer
[5:13:33] <TempestEvolution> Oh yeah the villain organizatio is called J6 which are the series shadoloo and ultra-tech
[5:13:34] <%thewb32018> Good games
[5:13:34] <+jsavage978> That was overkill lol
[5:13:34] <bendl__> wow what a great looking stage!
[5:13:44] <kaiserSet> GRAB
[5:13:47] <%Frizen_101> @Daldondo yeah he wanted to see those man tits
[5:13:49] <%titanium_kyle> @OuterRaven np doodBro
[5:13:49] <%NualphaJPN> definitely a lot more side stepping tbh
[5:13:49] <DSveno_Uguu> sick dodge
[5:13:53] <hujkull> 66 p pressure
[5:13:54] <%DarKaoZ> hmmm... i can't think of much, just apply the things you know when the time comes
[5:14:00] <Kingfried> @linerider VF & DOA are similar, differences being VF has delay-able inputs in all string attacks, & DOA having universal defense shared in all characters.
[5:14:01] <+Owltosser> nice punish off the side step SeemsGood
[5:14:03] <+mattshuut> jean is such a good character
[5:14:04] <Qu3nty_> akira looking like my boy Kiryu
[5:14:09] <Annat3l> more dick twisting!
[5:14:10] <FreeLawX> this fighting game is so raw. no comeback mechanics or supers. just straight dueling
[5:14:11] <kobura57> le_kinkss both
[5:14:24] <DNICE3838> in person game looks even more amazing stream dnt do it justice
[5:14:26] <EmtBeyond> This OST slaps
[5:14:27] <ControlTheCrowd> @le_kinkss There are only 3 buttons but  it depends on your character
[5:14:32] <MoraeDev> yea VF and DOA are similar game since DOA started as VF wannabee
[5:14:41] <%Brunty023> @le_kinkss It varies with the characters. Some have tight executions in their moves, like Akira has a straight up one frame input in one of his moves
[5:14:41] <%GabuFGC> Don't for about P P P+Hold > K That low can really catch people off guard
[5:14:52] <vietboiandrew> 3-0 steeb plz
[5:14:53] <%identitydisc> Boolie doodSteve
[5:14:59] <ControlTheCrowd> @dnice3838 Agreed it’s crispy live
[5:14:59] <%josdean22> DOA still has the bigger plot Kappa
[5:14:59] <NB4X> tekken clone
[5:14:59] <%UndeservingKonomichan> abbaOwO
[5:15:02] <MoraeDev> for example both game have thre e buttons button layout, punch kick block.
[5:15:05] <%jakangg> Yea I think imma have to play this on a fightstick
[5:15:08] <drhivesphd> STEEB

[5:15:30] <%Frizen_101> @josdean22 with a bunch of personalities Kappa
[5:15:31] <+TheNeutralGame> is sidestep good? if so you should be doing it more. currently playing it very 2D except after knockdowns
[5:15:32] <baro667> played couple of matches today, super enjoying this comeback of VF :)
[5:15:34] <andesblaz> @maximilian_dood isnt this a new game free on ps+?
[5:15:34] <MoraeDev> nice whiff punish sir
[5:15:36] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood i think returning to neutral might help with some input issues, of course, when possible
[5:15:36] <hydration2o> @josdean22 does the plot move ?
[5:15:46] <%rhuug> damn i kinda feel sorry for steeb

[5:16:19] <wellbornwarrior> So what's with the netcode now?
[5:16:20] <Last_Shinobi> 43KPPKPK
[5:16:20] <%SquallAdv> @RakimRevenge and that's what makes it fun, pure fighting, no lame comeback mechanics
[5:16:21] <MoraeDev> DOA and TK did have some bad relationship, but mostly DOA single sided hating on TK for doing much better than them
[5:16:22] <%RofflessLWK> Man, the Yakuza and Judgement games have been such wonderful experiences and memories for me over these past few years. So nice to see them bring VF back too~ doodOK
[5:16:25] <%Ssoto02> Winning

[5:17:13] <RollbackReem> @dnice3838 thats good to hear

[5:17:33] <%SquallAdv> @Brunty023 same <3
[5:17:44] <migjacin2> Just came from ff7 first soldier streams, that game is not good. Although it’s still a beta
[5:17:44] <i0BEY> HypeMage
[5:17:46] <MoraeDev> like DOA was VERY respecting VF, as it started as wannabee of the VF, but TK wasnt following VF at all and ended up doing even better than VF. That's when DOA started shit talk on TK.
[5:17:46] <vietboiandrew> damn u 4-0 the man 😐
[5:17:50] <%Brogox> All that knee punching.
[5:17:50] <%krystalcute91> lol steeb was lost doodLUL
[5:17:52] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood if they don't recover fast after your 33P>K you can repeat 33P>K for extra damage
[5:17:54] <Last_Shinobi> use more of the charge puch and kick mix ups
[5:17:57] <%SquallAdv> @RakimRevenge a man of deep culture I see doodbenny
[5:18:04] <+Hinakun> this game looks like a game from 10 years ago right?
[5:18:04] <DNICE3838> this game is worth $30 all day
[5:18:10] <baro667> Max what do you think so far :) ??
[5:18:10] <%NikouliMakouli> doodMash doodMash doodMash
[5:18:10] <4I4C4E> Charged 5k on opponent wake up
[5:18:16] <RollbackReem> brad NotLikeThis
[5:18:21] <MoraeDev> pretty fun history
[5:18:26] <%NualphaJPN> you're doing a lot better now with the side stepping @Maximilian_DOOD if anything, try fuzzy guarding when opponents try to throw, for good punishes
[5:18:29] <%Brunty023> @SquallAdv I can't wait to go skateboarding and walking a shiba as Yagami! doodThirst
[5:18:32] <+Rekj_WoW> this looks like yakuza
[5:18:38] <LesClaypool> isnt there a drunken master kind of fighter in this game?
[5:18:43] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood but usually when they are close to a wall, depending on your distance
[5:18:44] <%SuketchiRyu> Mongolian stage?
[5:18:45] <%SquallAdv> @Hinakun it's remastered with a current gen engine from Yakuza 6, looks awesome to me (the og VF5 also looks incredible even today tbh)
[5:18:49] <RollbackReem> @hinakun its from 15 years ago
[5:18:50] <+gimpsz> Does vf use numpad notation or tekken notation
[5:18:52] <@NicoB7700> max is getting really good with Jean
[5:18:53] <isolatedcat> Can anyone tell this FG noob how ring outs a good thing? They've always looked like a no fun anti-climax mechanic to me
[5:18:54] <DNICE3838> yup
[5:18:54] <fIashman92> Shun is drunkard
[5:18:55] <tacticalnuke002> @lesclaypool Yes
[5:18:56] <cencalkain> are there ground grabs to?
[5:18:57] <%SquallAdv> @Brunty023 doodThirst doodThirst doodThirst
[5:18:59] <Insignificant_Cat> @LesClaypool Yes, Shun
[5:19:00] <+Ice_ArchAngel> @Rekj_WoW You mean Yakuza looks like Virtua Fighter
[5:19:03] <its__mono> when are u gonna go public? I got an uncle who wants to fight u
[5:19:04] <@Demented_Hag> can you not customize without dlc?
[5:19:05] <vietboiandrew> @rekj_wow yakuza engine
[5:19:09] <MoraeDev> numpad i think
[5:19:10] <%TheOGB> @Rekj_WoW they remade the game in the Yakuza engine
[5:19:12] <+Hinakun> oh, thanks for the answers
[5:19:13] <Baritone_Baphomet> I wanna go back to playing DOA but the net code is so bad... Being a wifi warrior doesn't help.  NotLikeThis
[5:19:13] <LesClaypool> nice
[5:19:14] <+Owltosser> @LesClaypool Yes, that would be Shun Di
[5:19:20] <i0BEY> 2020Partnered
[5:19:21] <ControlTheCrowd> I don’t think STEEB is ready LUL
[5:19:22] <%Kalzassa> @Rekj_WoW this remade version does use the Dragon Engine so will look similar graphically now.
[5:19:26] <fIashman92> @cencalkain For certain characters, yes
[5:19:26] <+Sekhon_98> that's the 7th best Jean in NA FOR YA
[5:19:27] <%AzathothWrath> @cencalkain Goh have a ton of ground grab
[5:19:32] <+gimpsz> @moraedev  thx
[5:19:37] <kaiserSet> 8-0
[5:19:41] <Era_dud> @its__mono He was fighting randos earlier. I dunno if he might go back later.
[5:19:41] <%RofflessLWK> @Brunty023 Me too!! I lost it when I found out we'll get to be in Yokohama as well! LUL Got this feeling it'll be my personal GOTY this year haha. If so, that'll be 2 Sega games as my GOTY back to back doodOK

[5:20:09] <SPARDA990> GG Strive ad FF7   This WEEK VoHiYo VoHiYo
[5:20:10] <%Harineto> @isolatedcat they reward good movement and space control at high level 😎
[5:20:15] <%subparmelon> subparmelon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Dog had a panic attack and Ive spent the last hour calming her down. Now I get to relax with some VF5 :)
[5:20:17] <%SquallAdv> @overlordmrpopo I think it will come out eventually
[5:20:19] <Kingfried> @hinakun gameplay wise, yes. Still it plays better than recent 3d fighters, no bogus verizontals like in SC, or other game breaking flaws. VF is polished & the system can be trusted to work for you. win/lose is 100% on the players here.
[5:20:21] <i0BEY> HypeMage
[5:20:23] <%HongChina> I'll always like how DOA paid tribute to VF with 5, naming their upgrade Last Round(like Final Showdown), with the VF guest characters, and damn they did them justice too
[5:20:30] <%NastyNate85> Ugh PSO2 NG is June 9
[5:20:31] <DSveno_Uguu> that kick is always good to watch
[5:20:34] <Last_Shinobi> 43 K on hit PPK on hit P on hit K
[5:20:41] <Rick_Smits> dudes a chain belt haha
[5:20:45] <ControlTheCrowd> @vietboiandrew LUL as we all do
[5:20:47] <%Brunty023> @RofflessLWK I can already sense Lost Judgment being my GOTY! I just wonder how they'll follow up the masterclass story that was Judgment
[5:20:49] <SPARDA990> VF  Looks like DOA
[5:20:52] <MoraeDev> VF does have WEIRD mechanics like gravity.
[5:20:55] <%demukio> demukio subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[5:20:56] <$Juicdei> Hm. I’m not too fond of the fighting for this
[5:20:57] <WolfenHeiger> want to try - 66P is a combo starter if it hits after 66P or 236P+K Crumple - wide dash in after 66P (combo starter)
[5:20:57] <%AzathothWrath> @cencalkain i think, Goh more like Marduk here and you can get out from the grab with certain countrr command
[5:20:58] <Leodash_> This reminds me how I really loathe Tekken's RAge Art
[5:21:10] <Baritone_Baphomet> Guilty gear comes out on the 10th right?
[5:21:13] <HOUSEOFWIL> what is PS02?
[5:21:25] <MoraeDev> i bet no one likes gravity mechanic in VF as it only favors certain characters like taka, oh taka players would like that mechanic though lol
[5:21:25] <%SquallAdv> @SPARDA990 Gameplay wise DOA is more close to VF than Tekken that's for sure
[5:21:26] <%Cgame_me811> @hongchina Agree doodOK
[5:21:27] <%parabolicf0rms> @sparda990 you've got it the other way around
[5:21:30] <+Mathias_Wolfbrok> @Leodash_ Rage is a rough mechanic, both in Tekken and Smash
[5:21:31] <%Myloe> @abaddonic I think it's the 11th
[5:21:31] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood remember it's KK after a blocked Charge attack to get the full effect, then you do the typical combo (9KG > 33P > K)
[5:21:33] <+Hinakun> phantasy star online 2
[5:21:34] <%Brunty023> @abaddonic June 11th. Or June 8th with early access
[5:21:36] <cencalkain> @AzathothWrath ohhh ok and im guessing some characters have like mount and grabs like him to
[5:21:41] <WolfenHeiger> 57 damage

[5:37:24] <ChaosImpact> That was your low parry, yes
[5:37:29] <AlteredScotsman> When juggling, try to use jab into 2p+k. It puts them in a state where you can follow up with 46pk

[5:39:32] <%Brunty023> @skurke_ They're to indicate circular attacks that can't be sidestepped
[5:39:34] <+Owltosser> @skurke_ It's like a heavy attack, usually happens with roundhouse kicks. The attack has longer start up and recovery, but pushes opponent away on block

[5:44:25] <%HongChina> @Viewtifulotaku7 I feel at home here, I feel like a lot of people like me who played VF way back took refuge under DOA because its the closest thing to it
[5:44:29] <%rtdc31> LUL LUL
[5:44:31] <+Amsallja> Is the netcode good?
[5:44:33] <zhuravli> Yeah as someone who played doa, vf is pleasantly familiar

[5:51:43] <RollbackReem> @idrisstekken clearly you never played mortal kombat 11
[5:51:44] <Shinji10TH> So unlike other FG, VF has no super/ex/whatever mechanic, just plain combos
[5:51:44] <SamBluehawk> Just picked up VF5US since only hearing about the series and barely playing the PS3 version, can't to try it out! Gonna try Wolf to see how it goes

[5:52:18] <@Viewtifulotaku7> VF is a GROUNDED based fighting game.

[5:52:22] <@Nightbot> The Virtua Fighter series is a long standing 3D fighting game that started back in 1993 and is widely known as the 1st of it's kind and has set the grounds for numerous other 3D fighting games that follow after.

[5:54:02] <MoraeDev> crouch jab is always good option lol
[5:54:05] <Feurta> 4Head just play the 360 version of vf
[5:54:06] <%Funknificent> Was that mfing aop? doodHokey
[5:54:06] <WolfenHeiger> another combo:  (Crumple) > [6][6][P] CH   [3][3][P][K] - 66P is a combo starter if it hits after 66P or 236P+K Crumple - wide dash in after 66P (combo starter)

[5:54:54] <%SuketchiRyu> stage giving Nibelheim vibes
[5:54:54] <@VarryoChoco> I think Judgment's Yagami fighting style :Crane & Triger style will fit better for guest character in VF after Majima.

[5:55:02] <Kobukson> eileen is ripley?
[5:55:02] <%Brunty023> @GaryGoodJob Nice! And you'll get to experience it in that buttery 60fps smoothness
[5:55:04] <+Mathias_Wolfbrok> Also geez the matches are fast in this
[5:55:07] <AlteredScotsman> @mathias_wolfbrok We do. I'm on a discord to try and get matches because no one plays it online anymore. :(
[5:55:14] <Nesizthabest> June 12
[5:55:20] <%Brunty023> @VarryoChoco I agree! Yagami would fit much better
[5:55:27] <%GaryGoodJob> @ammoniawasp Yeah I’m stoked I waited to play it assuming the ps5 version would be announced
[5:55:28] <@Nightbot> Check out NZXT’s newest Starter PC series! An excellent first gaming PC--perfect for school work and working from home while maintaining great gaming performance. Built and shipped within 48 hours with a 2-year warranty. http://nzxt.co/SPC_MaxChat
[5:55:29] <@Viewtifulotaku7> I think Yagami would be the perfect guest/newcomer to a VF game.
[5:55:33] <Mormegil84> Hopefully, it comes to Xbox and PC eventually
[5:55:36] <Daffydor> I thought this game, without any supers or form of meters, would be a little more grapple-oriented
[5:55:45] <%thewb32018> Kick punch it's all in the mind Kappa
[5:55:45] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Since we know Kiryuu can't be in a fighting game Yagami is the best bet.
[5:55:51] <%majorbashir2> only 3 buttons and you can make wonders,  that's insane.
[5:55:52] <+Mathias_Wolfbrok> @AlteredScotsman Yeah I think everyone is either gonna use PS4 or Parsec from now on
[5:55:58] <MoraeDev> she needs to become the MONKE
[5:56:01] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Ichiban can join Tekken.
[5:56:02] <%HongChina> Yagami would be dope
[5:56:04] <%Brunty023> Speaking of Yagami, that new Snake style he's getting in Lost Judgment looks hype
[5:56:05] <+fgcDraft> best of 5 makes sense for this, matches go by quick
[5:56:09] <idrisstekken> good no rage art in this game SeemsGood
[5:56:09] <%MikeyJC> @Daffydor I mean, all characters have like a dozen grabs
[5:56:15] <+BigWaldo7713> yagami would be fantastic as a guest
[5:56:16] <AlteredScotsman> @daffydor Nah. It's very strike and mix up based. Lots of movement and sidesteps.
[5:56:19] <PuddingFighter_> Yagami or Majima would be good fits
[5:56:20] <AmmoniaWasp> @GaryGoodJob I just had a huge backlog and then I saw the upgrade and was like yep leaving it on the back burner till the upgrade
[5:56:24] <+aroo27> what we need is the DLC Sonic mascot suit from Tokyo Olympics 2020
[5:56:25] <+ath92> she's always recovering with a low sweep
[5:56:25] <Kobukson> yagami from judgement has crane, tiger and snake style kung fu
[5:56:29] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> @Daffydor It definitely seems to be that way at high level doodTerror

[5:56:38] <%GaryGoodJob> @brunty023 I can’t wait it’s gonna look insane in 60fps
[5:56:39] <Autaki> Should have the main character from Judgement to show up as a guest character for vf

[5:56:46] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Tonemanzero Yes
[5:56:49] <Daldondo> No
[5:56:54] <%MisterVFDC> if wake up kicks are ciruclar, you can't parry them
[5:56:56] <+Mathias_Wolfbrok> @AlteredScotsman At least until they start adding DLC characters to US
[5:56:56] <+Owltosser> not sure
[5:56:59] <greycreeze2345> Isn't the kick mid not high?
[5:57:05] <%MisterVFDC> also jean doesn't have kick parries
[5:57:07] <sweetkek> Yagami is dependent on whether they can secure rights from the actor. Prolly unlikely.
[5:57:08] <%VZLABoi> @Daffydor  yeah check tournament videos for high level game play this is not representative, as the doods are learning doodGood
[5:57:10] <OhSoSouls> Can Aoi parry them?
[5:57:11] <JC75_> @Maximilian_DOOD i thought Jacky was your boy?
[5:57:21] <AlteredScotsman> Characters like Taka and Wolf are very grab based.
[5:57:21] <%Tonemanzero> Thanks @viewtifulotaku7 for the confirm
[5:57:24] <%SuketchiRyu> SingsNote CurseLit
[5:57:25] <%MisterVFDC> Aoi can parry circular attacks yes

[5:57:40] <OhSoSouls> Okay thanks
[5:57:41] <DSveno_Uguu> I remember Aoi is pretty hard to play
[5:57:43] <%Brunty023> @sweetkek Yeah, that would be the kicker. Getting Kimutaku for a game that ISN'T Judgment

[5:58:25] <%VZLABoi> @Emrino94  yes
[5:58:26] <JC75_> it's better than tekken blocking sound imo
[5:58:27] <%HongChina> @EtherNigh its J6 weapons testing room, its where you fight Dural
[5:58:32] <sweetkek> @Brunty023 It's a risky move too. If SMAP boi ends up in a huge scandal they'll have to redo the character.

[5:59:08] <Daldondo> nvm its like 4 in there
[5:59:09] <+Owltosser> @UltimateRedFire never played Shun Di, but he seems pretty crazy. All I know about him is that he gets stronger as he drinks more

[6:08:30] <drunken_scribetv> Goh :D

[6:09:30] <TigerClaws12> put him on Wifi
[6:09:31] <AlteredScotsman> You guys need to stop doing 2P on knockdown. It's so bad :D
[6:09:36] <retro_mixup> netcode is good but matching is terrible, game needs a region icon
[6:09:38] <%Dakuu75> is there such thing as "perfect" net code... (maybe power rangers or Strive)
[6:09:38] <+aroo27> the password is 8008

[6:09:50] <odiz395> if only there was a "B*** im wild " stamp
[6:09:54] <0bani> That getup kick damage tho
[6:10:00] <sweetkek> I'm pretty sure Max played someone in Japan earlier.
[6:10:01] <DSveno_Uguu> how do people even define "hard" character
[6:10:02] <bryllun> This game doesn't have regional matchmaking.
[6:10:02] <zhuravli> Those who says DOA is only a titties waifu game, certainly hasn't play the game Kappa
[6:10:16] <%Ratchet446> OH SNAP KENNY IS UP
[6:10:19] <Baritone_Baphomet> ^
[6:10:25] <badmm2012> @Maximilian_DOOD are u going to check out fighting ex layer switch?
[6:10:25] <%BAESUKI> Eileen does too
[6:10:34] <JC75_> In this game you can pick anyone as your first character but it's a bit of a different thing to start off in something like Guilty Gear with someone like Ramlethal
[6:10:34] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> really should have kept the 10th anniversary models
[6:10:37] <%Funknificent> BISH IM WILD doodLeon
[6:10:37] <vietboiandrew> roman reigns
[6:10:39] <%Dakuu75> glad I wasn't the only one to notice the hunch-backs on these ppl
[6:10:43] <Rexxel16> who is playing? is max playing with his mind?
[6:10:44] <ChaosImpact> ooh, Kenny got combos
[6:10:47] <%Like17Badgers> Like17Badgers subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! so the big gimmick to this netcode is that it uses Google's relays, so anyone closer to those relays is gonna have a much better connection VoHiYo
[6:10:47] <AmmoniaWasp> @zhuravli explain the volleyball spin off series then LUL
[6:10:52] <DSveno_Uguu> I certainly did play DoA because of the characters but stayed because it's fun
[6:10:53] <+MissionHillBlvd> @zhuravli youre right! master chief is in there with the tiddies and waifu's too! Kappa
[6:10:53] <%Ratchet446> I'M WILD
[6:10:55] <Barbarian_8000> It looks pretty damn good!
[6:10:55] <@Viewtifulotaku7> My favorite character in DoA is probably Mila and she is one of the least lewd. scjShrug
[6:10:58] <%DPSalt> @dakuu75 Perfect would be even 0 bar connections feeling good
[6:11:01] <AlteredScotsman> @dsveno_uguu Lots of different key moves and difficult inputs.
[6:11:03] <PuddingFighter_> Its like he has a back-pack inside his body
[6:11:04] <%Gates_McCloud> Wish, I'm Bild!
[6:11:09] <keroblack2> Those who says DOA Beach Volley Ball is only a ******* waifu game, certainly hasn't play the game
[6:11:13] <stardragon92> i ain't seeing combos from both of them
[6:11:16] <maohayato> @DSveno_Uguu thats a spinoff. DOA the fighting game is legit
[6:11:22] <%scorpio990> doodLeon bitch I'm wild!
[6:11:25] <%VZLABoi> @Rexxel16  you can see the names under the life bar... none of the players is Max
[6:11:33] <greycreeze2345> @Viewtifulotaku7 ah I see you have good taste
[6:11:34] <@VarryoChoco> @Maximilian_DOOD what is the pw?
[6:11:34] <ShadowDOA96> this kinda reminds me of when max played doa6 I was really hoping to see some online matches NotLikeThis
[6:11:38] <+gophinobi23> DOA is a very competent fighter, but all degens wanna talk about is tItIeS
[6:11:38] <Wiiplayah43> @salty_luchador focus on fun, and learning becomes easy, even if they're complex
[6:11:42] <%RofflessLWK> @keroblack2 LUL LUL
[6:11:45] <bryllun> Simply put. DoA needs to be acknowledged more.
[6:11:46] <+sgurvy_> classic skins look jokes
[6:11:47] <%Dakuu75> @keroblack2 your right. I haven't played it and that is a thing I say.
[6:11:49] <zhuravli> DOAX is seperate game it doesn't count Kappa
[6:11:49] <Djlethal12> if you use this model you get more fps Kappa
[6:11:54] <ibrahim330> how's the online ?
[6:11:56] <AlteredScotsman> Someone tell simmons to stop doing 8P on knockdown. It's not worth it :D
[6:12:04] <sn0wcie> @Viewtifulotaku7 MILA BEST GIRLL

[6:12:06] <badmm2012> chat did max already tried the new fighting EX Layer?
[6:12:07] <DSveno_Uguu> people talked about tiddies actually people who aren't playing DoA though
[6:12:10] <WolfenHeiger> hehe
[6:12:13] <+upgradedd> DOA is a really good game though
[6:12:16] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> doa is a good game and beach voleyball is the also th ebest volleyball game currently available, despite it'snegative rep
[6:12:17] <AmmoniaWasp> @bryllun it is acknowledged for what it is a dlc skimpy outfit simulator withh boobas
[6:12:20] <keroblack2> @RofflessLWK @Dakuu75 lmao
[6:12:22] <@Demented_Hag> doa would be acknowledged more if that dlc situation didn't happen
[6:12:25] <maohayato> seriously, DOA2 for the time was a very good looking game on the DC and PS2. and it still is

[6:13:08] <+SwordMasterSnakes> He better apologize in Mandarin quick Kappa
[6:13:09] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Demented_Hag I never even acknowledged the DLC thing since it was never for characters and just costumes.
[6:13:10] <Alexm305> DoA is great I don't play it much but mechanically I like it as much as the SC series
[6:13:12] <WolfenHeiger> last one from me:  [4][K][P] (Wall) or [4][P][K] (Wall)   [6_][P] ► [2][P][+][K] ► [4][6][P][K] (Wall Slump) ► [4][K][P] (Wall Hit) ► [4][6][K][+][G] - delay before 46P
[6:13:21] <+koey__> what the MVCI is jean's picture on the loading screen
[6:13:24] <+upgradedd> VF doesn't seem as hype as other 3D fighters imo
[6:13:28] <@Demented_Hag> yeah but the game got so much bad press cause of it Viewtifulotaku7
[6:13:29] <%Dakuu75> even Jean has a hunch back, what's up with that
[6:13:29] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> if doa had workin netcode day one and not over 1000 dollars in dlc avaiable it woul dbe much mor ewell regarded. It's a beuatiful game
[6:13:30] <+gophinobi23> Only thing that they really needed to add to DOA were universal throw breaks and a competent sidestep...if DOA had those two things, it'd be even better
[6:13:32] <%pinkdolphin95> Eileen low tier
[6:13:34] <Baritone_Baphomet> It's nice to see there's still love for dead or alive.  For years I've seen the fgc crap on the series.
[6:13:34] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> It's his first day HahaCat
[6:13:35] <i_am_ad0pted> see how max doesn't comment on it lol
[6:13:38] <AlteredScotsman> @wolfenheiger Who are these combos for? Which character?
[6:13:39] <%Katsu_Kobashi> Katsu_Kobashi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[6:13:40] <%zefitz> jeez why all the square brackets for combo notation
[6:13:41] <JC75_> @koeyzzz jean is a jojo character
[6:13:41] <@Demented_Hag> i personally didn't care much Viewtifulotaku7
[6:13:43] <WolfenHeiger> happens not to have a wall
[6:13:44] <%BBboy20> playing DOA Ultimate on launch online was a good time
[6:13:49] <belle_lockhart> Jean is cool
[6:13:57] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> yeah they're abit hunched forward
[6:13:59] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Demented_Hag Me neither. Just found it weird how people thought it was bad.
[6:14:00] <%doritosburger> you made a joke? you're a bad person no partnership for you Kappa
[6:14:08] <Alexm305> @abaddonic DoA 6 is actually legit to be honest but nobody plays its the same as GBVS
[6:14:08] <TexasHighwayman> DOA by the title itself is misleading. i expect some gore sh*t fighting game
[6:14:08] <risorice> she's so small LUL
[6:14:11] <ChaosImpact> the counter is like Jacky Neutral but you have control over it
[6:14:12] <%ChaosedStar> how's the newest doa  play online  @viewtifulotaku7 ?
[6:14:13] <WolfenHeiger> fan boying Max Jean
[6:14:14] <thealsian> Kyokushin Karate
[6:14:19] <+gophinobi23> I hated the sidestep attack in DOA6 and how it costed meter
[6:14:28] <Hericknhx> they both do Karate so they gonna have similar stuff
[6:14:31] <GuyWithAnAmazingHat> @upgradedd it's faster paced and technically as or more complex than Tekken, it's the Japanese go to 3D fighter
[6:14:35] <+KayinCR> Newest Doa is kinda crap online. Not a good game.
[6:14:37] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @zefitz VF input timing is odd compared to other fighting games so sometimes the notations help.
[6:14:42] <%RofflessLWK> I enjoy watching Kasumi players in DOA, something about her moves is so entertaining and nice to see~
[6:14:44] <Baritone_Baphomet> @alexm305 the netcode doesn't help.
[6:14:44] <maohayato> to this day, what full 360 movement 3d fighter has good netcode? maybe fightcrab and thats it
[6:14:49] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @ChaosedStar MEH.
[6:14:50] <ChaosImpact> Max want that Parry follow up so bad LUL
[6:14:55] <%doritosburger> LUL
[6:14:56] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> I mean you can do other sidestep atatck sion doa without meter, but they dont have crush priority
[6:14:59] <greycreeze2345> @gophinobi23 It was fine the patch before the implemented that change as well T_T
[6:15:04] <DSveno_Uguu> sad thing is most old fighting games are dead because of the netcode
[6:15:06] <@Viewtifulotaku7> I love DoA, but 6 online. lytNOTIKETHIS
[6:15:09] <+nolifegamin> I like that VF has a place in the FGC, but I was never a huge fan - I prefer Tekken, Tekken just seems to have more personality to its gameplay/characters
[6:15:16] <AlteredScotsman> @upgradedd You haven't seen pro players play this then :D
[6:15:16] <+KayinCR> Even adding Rachel couldn't get me back into it. She was much better in Ultimate.
[6:15:17] <%Dakuu75> it's the Steeb-inator~
[6:15:17] <wellbornwarrior> What made you take Jean, Max?
[6:15:19] <hanz12891> @maximilian_dood Hows the netcode?

[6:15:25] <%juan1_2_3> wasnt Shenmu ment to be called Virtua rpg or something
[6:15:27] <kaiserSet> have max lose a game yet
[6:15:27] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> think of special button atatcks as an alternate system with its own counters you can dip in and out of
[6:15:29] <Alexm305> @abaddonic the netcode was not great but what really got me was how taxing it was to play on PC it wasn't the best port so people dropping frames made online worse
[6:15:32] <AmmoniaWasp> @DSveno_Uguu thats where programs like Parsec help
[6:15:36] <%ChaosedStar> that's to bad doodOuch doodOuch doodOuch doodOuch
[6:15:37] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @wellbornwarrior He wanted to use someone new and thought Jean looked cool.
[6:15:39] <%juan1_2_3> with Virtua fighter fighing system
[6:15:39] <sbz3er0> I'm so happy this game is free
[6:15:50] <%Vorgor1> Vorgor1 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:15:56] <+upgradedd> I haven't seen any pro VF players didn't know they existed
[6:16:06] <keroblack2> that eileen slow mo tho...
[6:16:07] <risorice> @nolifegamin vf is a little more realistic
[6:16:08] <%TheOGB> Jean's stand ability is THE FEAR
[6:16:09] <JC75_> what is wrong with Eileen's lower lip? has she been punched in the mouth
[6:16:14] <%juan1_2_3> Yakuza as well
[6:16:15] <AlteredScotsman> Launchers are not safe. You can punish with PK.
[6:16:16] <Baritone_Baphomet> @alexm305 yeah, the game needed more love in all aspects.
[6:16:20] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @upgradedd Dude, most pro players in FGC were VF players LUL
[6:16:21] <+CHEETO_TAXES> Akira has a +1 high launcher
[6:16:24] <%Kalzassa> @Vorgor1 doodDood doodSweet
[6:16:24] <+koey__> launchers are usually throw counterable
[6:16:25] <%Kyle_Steen> Chat real quick, I have DOA 6. Should I get 5 anyways?
[6:16:25] <+AceofSpades17> Why does Eileen have longer hair than in her portrait lol?
[6:16:27] <+gophinobi23> @gophinobi23 Yesssss...DOA6 was in a great state before they made that change. They even had a 'bug' where throw punishing the SSA was a high counter throw...but it was a great bug imo
[6:16:34] <@VarryoChoco> @Maximilian_DOOD It said the pw is incorrect.
[6:16:36] <%doritosburger> she got merked
[6:16:36] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Kyle_Steen Might as well.
[6:16:39] <%zefitz> @Viewtifulotaku7 Oh yeah for sure. Its probably just copy pasted but it just looks overly hard to type [4][K][P] rahter than 4KP
[6:16:41] <%juan1_2_3> Jin Kappa
[6:16:43] <%VZLABoi> @upgradedd  well VF5 has been around since 2006

[6:17:37] <greycreeze2345> @gophinobi23 speaking of great bugs I miss when Rig can go over your body when switching to stance causing a side switch T_T
[6:17:38] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Though I suggest you get some rest and water.
[6:17:38] <%doritosburger> I'm drunk because pandemic LUL
[6:17:39] <+nolifegamin> @risorice yea that's probably why I don't prefer it, my tastes in FGs are for more stylized fighting games, like Guilty Gear
[6:17:39] <AlteredScotsman> Brad's parry only blocks mid kicks.
[6:17:40] <HatefulMexicanBob> AceofSpades17 portraits are default skin but the ingame model was customized by the player

[6:18:24] <Shino_B_Gaming> 2p isn’t real
[6:18:27] <%MisterVFDC> baji quan
[6:18:28] <Dengleichunbow> Akira is hakkyoken
[6:18:29] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Akira is Bai Ji Quan.
[6:18:29] <Bajocontinuo> This game looks more fun than tekken  i wish i had a PS4
[6:18:30] <risorice> Akira is bajiquan
[6:18:30] <%HongChina> Akira is bajiquan
[6:18:31] <tacticalnuke002> Akira is Baji Quan
[6:18:34] <%MisterVFDC> Akira does Baji Quan
[6:18:35] <ryukenchi> akira is def not karate
[6:18:35] <%MateriaGuru> Akira is Bajiquan
[6:18:39] <+Biohazard724> So is Jean just Edgelord Ken with no fireball?
[6:18:40] <BB_BeastGaming> who's the boxer?
[6:18:40] <bryllun> Jean is the first karate user in VF?
[6:18:41] <machriphi> @upgradedd I just named two...
[6:18:41] <+Owltosser> @Maximilian_DOOD Akira is Baji Quan, an explosive martial art style from China
[6:18:45] <votablesavage> Jojo poses?
[6:18:48] <AMIdDST> I thought Akira is like mixed karate and kung-fu, but alright.
[6:18:50] <%pinkdolphin95> Bajiquan
[6:18:52] <mariosonicboss> Chinese martial art   which is sicl
[6:18:53] <NeroIscariot12> @Maximilian_DOOD Akira is based of a chinese martial art called Baijiquan or Hakkyoken
[6:18:53] <DJ_is_Raiden> akira is baji quan
[6:18:59] <Baritone_Baphomet> Bajiquan like kokoro from DOA
[6:19:00] <Alexm305> @koeyzzz 6p>2p 2p>5p K,P>G ect its more mixup and reads than turn stealing but it has some too
[6:19:03] <%MightySandwich> Baja Blast
[6:19:03] <%MisterVFDC> does jean have... makeup?
[6:19:03] <%lordlad> akira is 'eight limited fist'..it's chinese kungfu
[6:19:04] <WolfenHeiger> is the lobby 4 players only?
[6:19:14] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Funny enough: Most other fighting games don't have Bai Ji Quan users.
[6:19:15] <%RofflessLWK> Bajiquan? Hey isn't that what Kokoro uses too :D
[6:19:18] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> bajiquan, like bayonetta
[6:19:19] <%doritosburger> never even heard of baji quan
[6:19:19] <tacticalnuke002> Monke af
[6:19:20] <i_am_ad0pted> does max ever not use some edgy character?
[6:19:25] <bryllun> What martial art get less represented in fighting games, chat?
[6:19:25] <%MisterVFDC> lobby can be up to 16
[6:19:28] <+billy_deez> awesome, lets goo akira
[6:19:28] <%MisterVFDC> + spectators
[6:19:29] <SmugumiP> Akira vs Kokkoro :)
[6:19:30] <bluerbobo> i like to think jean is just a major weeb who changed his name moved to japan
[6:19:32] <%MightySandwich> @WolfenHeiger I think it's up to 16(?)
[6:19:32] <risorice> @MightySandwich Banjo Smash
[6:19:33] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Kokoro in DOA4 was inspired and based off of Akira from VF.
[6:19:36] <JC75_> When i hear bajiquan i think of Tekken's Leo, nobody else?
[6:19:39] <+koey__> @Alexm305 yeah agreed
[6:19:40] <Nibuno> I Cant drink more cuz tequila bottle is down , but im ok !!! (i guess)
[6:19:45] <Cman70> Why is the time so short in this game
[6:19:46] <%Murgurth> Does Akira practice a similar style to Julia and Leo from Tekken? They use that same shoulder charge
[6:19:49] <WolfenHeiger> I mean lobby set to 4 players
[6:19:51] <+Owltosser> @RofflessLWK Yep, it's also what Leo and Julia Chang from Tekken uses iirc
[6:19:52] <+gophinobi23> @gophinobi23 I don't...Rig has always given me problems. Didn't need one more piece of crazy tech to deal with lol
[6:19:53] <%Fly_Xcur> @i_am_ad0pted Ken lol
[6:19:54] <Harrason> some people in chat said bai ji quan but it's ba ji quan
[6:19:54] <TfernandoS> is this on pc?
[6:19:58] <maohayato> @bryllun pentjak silat probably
[6:19:58] <%Bholorak> julia kokoro and akira do the same fighting style
[6:19:59] <Kobukson> i want a leithwei stylist
[6:20:01] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Nibuno Don't drink too much.
[6:20:03] <tacticalnuke002> Baji Quan is used by Kirei Kotomine in Fate/Zero
[6:20:04] <keroblack2> @JC75_ and Julia, me thinks
[6:20:05] <%Supersonic540> who is the Baji Guan character from tekken? i forget their name
[6:20:06] <%lordlad> Akira is OG

[6:20:20] <Wiiplayah43> @cman70 probably to encourage aggression
[6:20:20] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Harrason If that is how it really is then I am sorry.
[6:20:22] <%HongChina> @doritosburger It's pretty commonly used in fighting games. Akira in VF, Kokoro in DOA, Leo in Tekken
[6:20:28] <%MisterVFDC> jean cant parry kicks
[6:20:29] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> as it is chinese it can be said any number of ways, theres no transliteration that is certain
[6:20:30] <%Frizen_101> @cman70 Because you’re there to fight or die
[6:20:30] <JC75_> @Supersonic540 leo primary, julia and michelle secondary

[6:20:50] <AMIdDST> @bryllun There's like hundreds of martial arts that don't get representation in vidya.
[6:20:51] <%Murgurth> @risorice thanks. I might end up using Akira when I get the chance to play because I enjoy Julia’s attacks so much.
[6:20:52] <%Supersonic540> @JC75_ LEO... i could only think of the name Lars lol. thanks
[6:20:56] <%VZLABoi> @i_am_ad0pted  LUL

[6:21:07] <%HongChina> Yun also uses bajiquan
[6:21:08] <vietboiandrew> unpunishable super man punch
[6:21:12] <NeroIscariot12> @Maximilian_DOOD Akira is based of a chinese martial art called Bajiquan or Hakkyoken
[6:21:14] <%yeknomlive> @Murgurth akira julia share a lot of moves. double jump kick, the dash elbow, that weird uppercut
[6:21:18] <keroblack2> CHAT, DOES Y'ALL READ KENJI MANGA?

[6:21:37] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @HongChina I always say his is a more "fantasy based" of the style because of what he does with it.
[6:21:38] <%ChaosedStar> lobby size is set to 4?

[6:22:18] <vietboiandrew> @chaosedstar yes for his buddys
[6:22:24] <+brasfist> I’d the game supposed to feel stiff? Even laying on the ground seems to take forever to get up
[6:22:29] <bryllun> @supersonic540 I love movies that involve that style man.
[6:22:32] <+Owltosser> @BB_BeastGaming Closest is Brad, who does muay thai/kickboxing
[6:22:35] <%Zoltekka> hey just popped in, How is the netcode?
[6:22:36] <pr1me_778> ngl, we should have a bot that count every "netcode" related questions

[6:22:58] <keroblack2> @Owltosser yep, that's bajiquan
[6:23:01] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> you can tech your get up and if you miss the window you have to lay down a bit
[6:23:01] <@Viewtifulotaku7> !vf5
[6:23:01] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+
[6:23:06] <bryllun> Brad is kickboxing, I believe.
[6:23:07] <%BBboy20> @SuketchiRyu he would just use belts than chains XD
[6:23:14] <thealsian> @SuketchiRyu Sephiroth Masters
[6:23:22] <fgc_splash> I LOVE THE TOP REPLAYS ON MENU claraaSip
[6:23:22] <SliScar> is there a way to view the stream from the beginning (just woke up) rewind, or do I have to wait for the VOD? ^^
[6:23:30] <%GoldenGear6> mmm.
[6:23:30] <+brasfist> Does it feel stiff to anyone else?
[6:23:32] <lazarusnecrosis> @owltosser Isn't Vanessa closer to Muai Thai? Brad seems more like traditional kickboxing.
[6:23:32] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @bryllun I said he was the closest. Not exactly.
[6:23:35] <%thewb32018> Ah okay
[6:23:35] <%DarkbuilderX> It's delay based, but the closer each player is to a node, the smoother it is
[6:23:37] <%Virtual_Rays> Basically Parsec servers in a nutshell
[6:23:39] <WolfenHeiger> hehe
[6:23:42] <machriphi> @brasfist Not really sure how laying on the ground translates to feeling stiff. Game is pretty fluid.
[6:23:45] <tedan44> chances of akira getting in tekken 7?
[6:23:46] <decisionsxd> Is Jean secretly Polnareff :0
[6:23:46] <+nolifegamin> @SuketchiRyu I would unironically love a Nomura-designed version of Ken
[6:23:46] <txcforever> Don't remember Jean being so cool to play.
[6:23:55] <seaechiowai> i guess that's an easier alternative to parsec
[6:23:55] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> vanessa is vale tudo and muay tai
[6:23:55] <pscarnage> @SilScar the vod is created as the stream is going so you can just watch the vod rn
[6:23:58] <SonnyBCreative> really wish it was on PC
[6:23:59] <%Murgurth> @suketchiryu I see it more of Araki making a SF character considering the bra, lipstick and androgynous look
[6:24:02] <sweetkek> Where did the google server relay info emerge from?
[6:24:10] <%HongChina> Better than normal delay-based, worse than rollback
[6:24:18] <Cman70> role back never works for 3d games
[6:24:19] <bryllun> I used to study taekwondo and quit immediately 'cause I hate using only kick.
[6:24:20] <maohayato> @lazarusnecrosis she is more mma to me, cuz of her grabs
[6:24:23] <%Fly_Xcur> @darkbuilderx so 2 people far from a node would be pretty doodOuch
[6:24:24] <%clumbums> Oh fuck if thats the case then Europe is gonna get fucked for delay
[6:24:27] <tacticalnuke002> Vanessa is Vale Tudo, Brad is Muay Thai but has been doing kickboxing tournaments lately so his MT stance is a bit off
[6:24:27] <JamoART> bn
[6:24:28] <%pinkdolphin95> @darkbuilderx Google relays with delay based. They just said it...... 😐
[6:24:28] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.

[6:24:40] <SliScar> @pscarnage TY friend :)
[6:24:42] <+Owltosser> @lazarusnecrosis haha idk actually, I always thought the two styles were very similar. Vanessa might do muay thai too, but in game they call it Vale Tudo
[6:24:44] <%thewb32018> Intense match
[6:24:47] <weshas> How is the netcode?
[6:24:51] <@Viewtifulotaku7> ...
[6:24:53] <machriphi> @sweetkek People with fancy routers can see who they're connected to and realized they were connecting to google servers instead of other players.

[6:25:48] <bluerbobo> american companies avoid us like plague
[6:25:49] <%Fly_Xcur> @cman70 rollback can work for 3D it just means if there's a lot of rolling back movement looks wonky

[6:31:53] <SteveEnglishStereotypeFox> It's a replay not a live match
[6:31:54] <GuyWithAnAmazingHat> karate just means "barehanded" and you can have different styles like Mishima for example

[6:35:53] <%MightySandwich> Looks like Fuudo just had a kid... On the day VF drops
[6:35:57] <Harrason> @Murgurth it feels like a bandaid that they're putting on the netcode as a budget option to not make the netcode insufferable but not wanting to commit the resources into actually making the netcode good and it'd be bad if the borderline functionality of this netcode deters them from committing to rollback for vf6
[6:35:59] <frogsonic> that mask is hideous
[6:36:02] <%Waredigo> @TheAlphaLobo strange, but fun doodLUL
[6:36:03] <+nolifegamin> this clearly proves delay-based netcode is superior Kappa rollback is a lie Kappa

[6:36:53] <GuyWithAnAmazingHat> @frogsonic yea that's the purpose, it's a demon to scare or disturb opponents

[6:37:35] <%Waredigo> Sega published a video covering what's in it. The soundtracks are the draw, imo.
[6:37:36] <Shiny_2> so do we finally have a better solution than rollback for FG netcode?
[6:37:38] <%OgGeek2016> The music and VF1 models are worth the $10

[6:42:50] <%MrMidLife> @Maximilian_DOOD higher res would be good, mostly I need devs to stop being lazy and at least have 1080, 60fps consistently as standard.

[6:42:55] <%Waredigo> LG's new oled monitor is targeting workstation / pro market
[6:42:56] <+stylofgc> @shino_b_gaming  it's coming in a firmware update very soon
[6:42:56] <machriphi> OLEDs can burn in which is a much bigger problem with a monitor that's going to have a lot of static images
[6:42:57] <%DarkbuilderX> I still have 1080p monitors, I keep pushing off buying new ones
[6:43:03] <@Belutima> can't wait when 1080p 120fps, becomes standard.

[6:43:14] <%Fly_Xcur> @kungfootitan rarely will a fighting game be Below 60fps
[6:43:15] <%WARWU1F> @ascenthe PS5 works with my ASUS 1440p 144hz monitor no problem
[6:43:17] <%Thejuanandonly559> PC release isn’t happening anytime soon just the way it is if you want to play get PlayStation or just wait for long ass while
[6:43:19] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> there was the BX model of the LG 55" OLED at little below 1000$ on amazon some days ago
[6:43:19] <i_am_ad0pted> smol brain steeb
[6:43:24] <%RD_Salem> 48 inch CX works well if you don't mind the size.
[6:43:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> 1440p is great. Its 1.8 times the amount of pixel compared to 1080p
[6:43:28] <%OgGeek2016> @boardscanada you can, but a monitor is better
[6:43:29] <%kungfooTitan> hang on let me refresh  the stream

[7:02:50] <%Supersonic540> this game has button combos that mapping wont work with

[7:02:55] <%BakaBakaNeko> @trashmyego Bad rollback is not good either, so this must be optimized delay based netcode.
[7:02:56] <Wofoeh> Ok chat, can someone explain me what the fuck is up with Jean’s fucken Michael Jackson glove?
[7:02:56] <%trashmyego> I just love that Sega did something with the netcode, it shows they at least understand and tried to make something work.

[7:03:19] <machriphi> @Wofoeh I think you just explained it yourself.
[7:03:23] <%Dwang> @shadowsun9 He wanted to try a character nobody played as much, and then he started having fun with Jean
[7:03:25] <%PseuDEEnym> does this game have a lot of simultaneously button presses for attacks?

[7:04:22] <Wofoeh> @raresteves they’re called “Wall throws”

[7:04:38] <%Dysfunkshnl> Dualsense is too big
[7:04:48] <%Kitsune826> a ps5 controller is designed to hurt your hand i'm pretty sure
[7:04:48] <Keihart> too much hispanic feedback? LUL
[7:04:50] <%juan1_2_3> ps5 controller is meaty for fighters I feel
[7:04:51] <+solidpeyo> PS5 needs a fighting pad
[7:04:54] <%juan1_2_3> maybe to meaty
[7:04:55] <amestan> This game need a PS5 upgrade, the aliasing is awful on the hairs
[7:04:55] <Vortexsilence> Hey Max, did you ever do martial arts in real life?
[7:04:57] <+RenoDeGeneric> VF just gives you arthritis
[7:04:59] <Do_The_Crab> is Jean new?
[7:05:05] <%Wan_SoLo> Thats what she said
[7:05:05] <+stylofgc> !returnal
[7:05:05] <@Nightbot> Returnal is a PS5 ONLY game that is a 3rd person rogue-lite shooter. Currently this is Max's GOTY.

[7:05:11] <+colefromspace> hey guys how's everyone doing?
[7:05:11] <+LBtrashyP> with the PS5 controller I was doing the claw
[7:05:12] <gremoryy> my friend just said is there no fireball in this game LUL i said bitch this is Virtua Fighter
[7:05:12] <%anthraxbees> my big hands love the size of the dualsense
[7:05:17] <nickshimko1991> hi
[7:05:18] <%Billiesan> I use the PowerA fightpad its like using a sega saturn controller
[7:05:19] <machriphi> @PseuDEEnym This game only has 3 buttons, but uses every combination of the 3 quite a bit.
[7:05:24] <@Nightbot> Check out NZXT’s newest Starter PC series! An excellent first gaming PC--perfect for school work and working from home while maintaining great gaming performance. Built and shipped within 48 hours with a 2-year warranty. http://nzxt.co/SPC_MaxChat
[7:05:25] <%Dwang> @Do_The_Crab He was added on Virtua Fighter 5 R I think? I may be wrong
[7:05:26] <%krystalcute91> !vf5
[7:05:26] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[7:05:29] <%nenjutsutv> Im using a PS4 remote and my hand still hurts lol
[7:05:31] <maxqowl> to big and vibrate a lot doodLewd
[7:05:36] <%Darena_Bryant> is it too small?
[7:05:39] <Wiiplayah43> it's not that big, better than xbox
[7:05:45] <logiclv23> Kreygasm
[7:05:45] <Do_The_Crab> @Dwang thank you
[7:05:46] <%nenjutsutv> PS5 remote feels so bloated
[7:05:52] <%juan1_2_3> doodLewd
[7:05:55] <%Kalzassa> It's partly cause of the Dpad being on the edge imo. That is the reason I prefer PS4/5 for analog and XB for Dpad, whichever is on the bottom is preferable imo.
[7:05:59] <tedan44> lol

[7:06:20] <%PseuDEEnym> @machriphi thanks. ima have to play on stick for this game then
[7:06:20] <@Nightbot> Watch our YoVideogames stream archives on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/yovideogames
[7:06:21] <%Dysfunkshnl> Dualsense feels better in the hand than Dualshock4, IMO, but no one holds a candle to XB360 for comfort
[7:06:23] <amestan> Lei Fei LOL

[7:07:44] <Turhaya> this looks really good!
[7:07:45] <%Dysfunkshnl> Dualshock 3 was flaming trash
[7:07:48] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Max is on stick though.
[7:07:49] <+RenoDeGeneric> PS2 controller was the best
[7:07:50] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> they are outright villains
[7:07:51] <%FutaSnek> @anthraxbees Yea agreed just not for every application
[7:07:52] <+solidpeyo> Hori needs to make the fighting commander octo to the PS5

[7:08:46] <voil_> Did max try out the tournament mode
[7:08:46] <themancalledben> that sf mad catz 6 button controller feels better than the hori imo
[7:08:47] <%OmegaFatalis> they have Fight Commanders in Walmarts now
[7:08:51] <%shadowsun9> There were a lot of issues with the PS3 @Dysfunkshnl

[7:22:39] <akbar_0> my girlfriend's name is vanessa, so i play her
[7:22:42] <+solidpeyo> of all characters, I like Vanessa the most
[7:22:43] <%king_rahh_> Why am I just figuring this out
[7:22:44] <EtherNigh> Vanessa and Ram what's the difference
[7:22:47] <%thewb32018> It'll be the last one in another hour Kappa
[7:22:58] <kobura57> VF is godlike stop asking lol
[7:23:05] <%Darena_Bryant> i'd also give some credit to the person playing vannessa. This guy is good.
[7:23:14] <Reactman7> wait is the customization like DOA?
[7:23:18] <upsora> @vigorrush the game is free, they have to make money somehow silly
[7:23:19] <%jakangg> @thewb32018 imagine flynnokTired
[7:23:25] <%thedankestmeeme> doodOne doodOne doodOne

[7:23:53] <Juan_V22> stop it, she is already dead BibleThump BibleThump
[7:23:55] <homersimpson_bazzerker35> I like levels in Virtual Fighter and in Tekken that you don't get ring outs just to easy to win a match
[7:23:55] <Ichiron47> @Reactman7 Yes. It was Mila.
[7:23:56] <EtherNigh> @maximilian_dood vanessa is like ram in strive, everybody loves her
[7:23:58] <%Dwang> @vigorrush customization was always DLC, even for FS. It's way cheaper than I thought it would be, considering it also has VF1 models and the whole soundtrack library of the Virtua Fighter series
[7:23:59] <+shmokejoestar> yo max jeans p+k stuff alot of Vanessa's mid options
[7:24:02] <%jakangg> flynnokSip

[7:24:21] <+Drdevice81> @bigmike102477 yup

[7:24:26] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[7:24:26] <%Brunty023> @Zeptoflare Well, it was remade by the same Yakuza devs!

[7:24:52] <@Viewtifulotaku7> What modern fighting game isn't 60fps? cirHuh
[7:24:53] <%king_rahh_> You literally cannot customize anything unless you pay for it tho I understand it’s free but that’s the reason I wanna play the game offline because I won’t have internet for a week which sucks

[7:25:16] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Paul was 1st.
[7:25:16] <Zeptoflare> @brunty023 yeah no I'm joking. Hopefully there will be a VF6 and Shenmue 4 with similar combat
[7:25:22] <%Brunty023> @majorbashir2 It's basically the same as tier list as Final Showdown, soooo... yeah it's technically already made

[7:30:11] <uzzux> Is this game easy? (I mean as, DOA and Tekken are not easy too much stuff at the beginning)
[7:30:16] <%leith_aziz> Music's pretty great from what I've heard
[7:30:20] <EtherNigh> I like the big hitting punch sound
[7:30:22] <+Globehead> @vigorrush The customization was DLC in FS as well
[7:30:23] <gamerpunt> is there a boxer in this game? like steve fox from tekken
[7:30:27] <@Viewtifulotaku7> I am spending a lot of time watching the player matches from the menu LUL
[7:30:28] <%thewb32018> @jakangg LUL I'm fine doodDerp
[7:30:30] <ssjgodgo> So how was this remake possible
[7:30:34] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @gamerpunt Closest is Brad.
[7:30:37] <+Drdevice81> @uzzux easy to get into but hella hard to get good at
[7:30:38] <%issun_boushi> @gamerpunt  yes absolutely
[7:30:43] <benjolstrenk> i read it virtua cop 5
[7:30:44] <%leith_aziz> @uzzux Well, there's not as ma ny characters and strings as T7, so there's far less bloating
[7:30:46] <+pkmn_catch_em_all> @gamerpunt Brad is a kickboxer and has really quick punches
[7:30:47] <%Onyx_13k> @uzzux Easy to get into, hard af to master
[7:30:49] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @ssjgodgo Because the Yakuza dev loves Virtua Fighter
[7:30:50] <%Mesharey> @uzzux eaey to get into at least
[7:30:50] <%leith_aziz> *many

[7:31:01] <%Deezyfesheezy> brad has sway motion like steve
[7:31:08] <%Brunty023> @Viewtifulotaku7 Right!? It's addictive to just sit back and watch all the matches being played from the menu

[7:31:15] <%krystalcute91> oh that monkey girl

[7:31:16] <+Mistouze> Nagoshi said "that series is mine now" @ssjgodgo
[7:31:21] <+Shen2> @uzzux VF is definetely LESS beginner friendly than Tekken and DOA.
[7:31:24] <Lucian_OW> she floats so high for juggles LUL

[7:32:33] <PrinceOfEden> @leith_aziz I also recommend Persona.
[7:32:33] <homersimpson_bazzerker35> I hate Ring Outs it's too cheap to winning matches easily
[7:32:35] <grimaximus> game is beautiful
[7:32:35] <@VarryoChoco> The Fett's accidents
[7:32:37] <Neoxon> @thebmanishere Not rollback good, but better than expected from delay-based
[7:32:39] <Q_Ebansu> DANCE
[7:32:40] <King_LVR> most of the music in this game are bangers.
[7:32:41] <%king_rahh_> @globehead was it base vf5 or fs on ps3 I remember you being able to unlock stuff
[7:32:51] <%leith_aziz> @PrinceOfEden That's Atlus. But im already a fan
[7:32:51] <dark_tsukuyomi> girl is DEAD
[7:32:52] <%thewb32018> Wow
[7:32:53] <novahyou> I'm gonna take a wild guess here and say that Max had a BLAST with this game if he's still up.
[7:32:54] <bel_akor_> Does this game have a good tutorial?
[7:32:55] <%r3load3d84> the comeback!
[7:33:00] <@TiffanyLockheart> LETS GOOO

[7:33:12] <PrinceOfEden> @leith_aziz You get one guess as to who Atlus is owned by.
[7:33:13] <%Dwang> The practice with Simmons paid off LET'S GOOO
[7:33:13] <%thewb32018> Max you animal
[7:33:15] <%barf_hideous> barf_hideous subscribed with Prime. 
[7:33:16] <+Edmond_SA> so how is this? is VF back?
[7:33:17] <Turhaya> @King_LVR big truth. was listening to all the tekken and other bangers from this time earlier
[7:33:18] <+sp0rsk> he even does the jotaro pose, Jean is totally a jojo
[7:33:19] <%leith_aziz> Are there matchup tutorials like in GG? Cause I love those
[7:33:21] <Illumina> Are you looking forward to not being allowed to sleep next week
[7:33:22] <phamhung0230> guilty gear have the best tutorial
[7:33:22] <Hayabusa222> Great round
[7:33:22] <%Youngxchaos> How's the online?
[7:33:26] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @leith_aziz No.
[7:33:26] <@DashXero> It's odd that VF4Evo had a better tutorial...
[7:33:28] <%Brogox> Have to try this after few hours
[7:33:28] <Neoxon> A lot of the old VF guard are with the Yakuza team, so it’s fitting that this remaster was given to them.
[7:33:35] <addarakunetostrive> Waiting for VF4Evo tutorial to be released as DLC Kappa
[7:33:35] <+PathlessCross> So basically like the whole game is lol. Just functional
[7:33:36] <%Dysfunkshnl> Ehhh
[7:33:39] <@Viewtifulotaku7> 10400
[7:33:39] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> vf4 is the one with the REALLY good tutorial

[7:33:55] <biggswedg3> grabs in 3d fighters Kreygasm
[7:33:59] <+pkmn_catch_em_all> @DashXero yeah I don't get it - why not just copy/paste that tutorial into VF5?
[7:34:00] <%krystalcute91> lol
[7:34:02] <%Dysfunkshnl> @Youngxchaos Mediocre
[7:34:05] <Neoxon> Any Vanessa mains in here besides me?
[7:34:14] <%qtgothwaifu> you that was huge
[7:34:15] <+Shen2> @Waredigo Yup, but with either Tekken or DOA you can essentially pick it up and button mash and it still looks fun. VF seems clunky AF when you first get into it. Sure, there are a few characters there are a bit more accessible.
[7:34:18] <@Viewtifulotaku7> CHOPPED
[7:34:19] <@DashXero> @pkmn_catch_em_all strangeShrug
[7:34:20] <bel_akor_> And how do you know which moves to use from a large list? Just want to look for to get started?

[7:34:59] <+pkmn_catch_em_all> @Do_The_Crab every VF character is in this
[7:34:59] <%Deezyfesheezy> everyone in 5FS us still here
[7:35:02] <%Brunty023> @bel_akor_ You basically find moves that you're comfortable with to pull off
[7:35:06] <%Waredigo> @Shen2 I agree, but in a weird way the pop-pop of VF is what drew me to it initially in arcades.. i liked the rythem better than Tekken.. DoA is stupid fun tho.. even for beginners.
[7:35:07] <Neoxon> What if we get a Super Switch announcement an hour from now?
[7:35:08] <Do_The_Crab> @Viewtifulotaku7 hell yeah

[7:35:12] <%issun_boushi> the hitsparks are so subtle and nice and smoky, let's you see the combat better
[7:35:14] <%Dwang> @bel_akor_ There's Command training which kinds helps tou figure out which commands work best. And yes, YouTube helps
[7:35:15] <+Callestere> @do_the_crab readyyyyyyyy Gih!
[7:35:15] <WolfenHeiger> :)
[7:35:16] <%king_rahh_> Vf isnt clunky imo it’s just the tekken and doa are that much faster paced this game is still pretty insane but not as the other two options
[7:35:19] <Saikyo_Analysis> @bel_akor_ look for fast/safe moves that can lead to something else
[7:35:21] <%leith_aziz> GG

[7:35:38] <%Onyx_13k> @bel_akor_ You can look up VFDC or VF wiki for a guide/strategy for some main moves to remember, besides that you can go in training mode and test moves for frame data

[7:35:52] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Because VF is the better 3D game. cirSip
[7:35:53] <hotai1806> It like bloodyroad
[7:35:53] <leith_aziz> The issue with Tekken is that a lot od old assets are reused, like Mishima hellsweeps
[7:35:55] <%thewb32018> doodDerp doodDerp doodDerp doodDerp
[7:35:55] <kobura57> Jean has a charge move for the ground if the guy doesn't techroll it does a bit damage
[7:35:55] <+MissionHillBlvd> tekken DEF feels clunky
[7:35:56] <ssjgodgo> U enjoying the game
[7:35:58] <%Waredigo> Its different flavors of 3d movement

[7:36:11] <FlowLethal> VF has coolest fluid martial arts feel
[7:36:11] <Neoxon> @maximilian_dood You think the Super Switch will be announced an hour from now?
[7:36:13] <+Owltosser> think it's just personal preference, there are things to like about both games
[7:36:22] <+Edmond_SA> @Maximilian_DOOD so how does this feel so far? Bit early to tell probably, but do your rekon we could we see a VF6 in the future?
[7:36:25] <sakmit> JEAN JEAN JEAN JEAN JEAN JEAN
[7:36:25] <%leith_aziz> Damn, even the lobby music is cool

[7:36:38] <codename92> ranking
[7:36:39] <%Dysfunkshnl> VF is much more life-like which looks slow but more weighty. Tekken is definitely faster
[7:36:40] <+Applicationking> @biggswedg3 probably character designs tho, not gameplay
[7:36:41] <%leith_aziz> Jean, Jean, Jean, Jean, Jean....
[7:36:41] <+Shen2> Oh, it's definetely the OPPOSITE of clunky at medium-high level. I was purely referring to the perspective of newscomers.

[7:36:43] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[7:36:44] <@DashXero> That's pretty good!
[7:36:44] <elementor374> SO MANY JEANS LUL
[7:36:45] <novahyou> Tekken has fancier combos and is more videogamey. VF is boring if you don't actually LEARN the game, which has insane depth @Maximilian_DOOD

[7:39:20] <styroslol> WutFace not eileen
[7:39:23] <%Zhardosh> I want this on pc pretty bad
[7:39:23] <%qtgothwaifu> ooooof
[7:39:23] <+Mecha_G> I've seen a Brad customized to look like Majima
[7:39:26] <novahyou> @Maximilian_DOOD This is the fighting game that changes the most if you know what you're doing
[7:39:27] <+pkmn_catch_em_all> @Maximilian_DOOD did you get the legendary edition?
[7:39:27] <Kidvid711> Love this game
[7:39:31] <biggswedg3> the weeb character
[7:39:32] <CaStike> gamer(other) LUL
[7:39:32] <%Aero_Ken> light speed
[7:39:34] <%Kalzassa> @Sir_Uncle Nah that is NGS alone...for now...Strive early access is the 8th though. Good in event NGS servers are funky day 1.
[7:39:36] <boardscanada> it's cool you can filter the skill settings of matches and then watch it in real-time
[7:39:46] <%MAX116030> and when game has good online which is not often sadly
[7:39:50] <Nibuno> yea , the "speed" of the gameplay is so much diferent (IM DRUNK)
[7:39:50] <%Dysfunkshnl> That Pink shit shouldn't be allowed
[7:39:54] <%Deezyfesheezy> that's alot of damage
[7:39:57] <kobura57> High level is very fast in fact
[7:39:57] <%Dwang> TBH I'd be just okay watching replays of people playing all day in the main menu, it's great seeing this skill level
[7:39:58] <dark_tsukuyomi> honoka?
[7:40:01] <+dr_squidward> This game still only 3 buttons?
[7:40:03] <+LkProd> those light things seem very distracting
[7:40:03] <%yhmjack1> @Maximilian_DOOD How do you feel the lobby in this?
[7:40:05] <sweetkek> Can you spectate random matches and not just watch replays?
[7:40:06] <%Zhardosh> Well max...you'll have plenty of time to learn in the coming weeks LUL LUL LUL
[7:40:06] <%kevinup86> the damage lol

[7:40:12] <%Aero_Ken> yeah, the trail lights are distracting
[7:40:13] <+immer_besser_als_du> this is a new game? looks like 2005
[7:40:15] <Ron2828> Is this the free game for PlayStation plus for june
[7:40:15] <boardscanada> this game should clean up on Switch in Japan if it ever gets ported
[7:40:16] <shiroieye> My hopes were too high for the release of this game and now I feel salty because of the lack of content and it reminded me of STFV when it first came out and made me more salty.
