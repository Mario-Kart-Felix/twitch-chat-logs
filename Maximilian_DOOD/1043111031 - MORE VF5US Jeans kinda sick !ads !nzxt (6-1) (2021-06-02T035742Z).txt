[0:22:00] <Chatterbox1991> Woolie believes that because VF5 went out of the way to copy Blitz Netcode over just using Rollback makes it look like Japanese Devs just straight up try and avoid the discussion of Rollback entirely.
[0:22:00] <%Frogballz007> all them codes are redeemed LUL yall are so fast

[0:22:05] <Doublenyher> any more codes?
[0:22:08] <%DarKaoZ> For Delay based is the best one atm imo, but just decent in a general Netcodes sense
[0:22:08] <%NualphaJPN> this game feels like a "testing ground" for SEGA to see how things go, in order to move forward with future titles

[0:22:09] <+SwiftKojiro> the fact that parsec is neccessary is unsavory
[0:22:12] <+Man_in_the_Red> so it doesnt compensate for lag, it compensate for jitter

[0:23:40] <ug_phvntxm_777> 🤔🤔🤔
[0:23:41] <r_altali> Not a fan of this system, mostly because there are few servers outside of USA
[0:23:42] <%RustyCoyoteA> oh that's crazy
[0:23:42] <+Dieelon> isn't it still just traveling the same distance though?
[0:23:44] <9a59df8f31> so they combined 2 technologies that aren't good for FGs LUL
[0:23:44] <SlimeRthyme> its a good solution but it's not good for remote places
[0:23:47] <%DarKaoZ> Hmmm... what would be more expensive in the long run? implement rollback or keep the servers? 🤔
[0:23:47] <Lyshty> so what happens when they dont want to pay for does servers anymore... annnd its very bad :(
[0:23:47] <%NualphaJPN> This may be coinciding with what SEGA is planning to create for cloud based servers here in Japan, with their arcades

[0:24:00] <%Xeltos_> @maximilian_dood Yeah SFV does it too, but rarely ever cause the netcode is flawed fundamentally
[0:24:02] <+Bravetriforcer> I don't see why adding a server to talk to would make the connection better when it is only 2 players

[0:24:10] <%OmegaFatalis> Isn't renting servers more expensive in the long run than just putting in rollback?
[0:24:11] <Mattais88> That's alright, but how long will they keep up with renting it?

[0:24:25] <+micpap25> what’s interesting is, if we’re using servers that also solves the ragequit issue. Servers can check for that.
[0:24:26] <%Wufaix> @Maximilian_DOOD That seems making a it more complicated than it should be. the tech exist. no reason not to use it.
[0:24:26] <%Astrophizz> it might be their PSO2 infrastructure
[0:24:28] <+Bravetriforcer> Spent all tat budget on buying a bunch of servers instead of adding fucking Rollback lmao

[0:28:01] <%SEGA> @moistnevada no u
[0:28:01] <%zane_dye> Ye i agree with you max. The hardest part is getting someone to come in and help with netcode
[0:28:02] <greycreeze2345> Just don't expect every game to have rollback netcode but you can still spread awareness about it
[0:28:02] <+NoviusII> arcsys is still creating the standard in the market
[0:28:05] <%SharpsPanda> VF5 is probably just to get people back into the brand  so they can green light VF6 which is smart. Like capcom, but not as bad
[0:28:05] <superfamycom> @Maximilian_DOOD Desn't SEGA already an experise with their fog gaming" Thing scoop that would shake the industry..?" remember?
[0:28:06] <%deathspit00> Jesus, Chat. Y'all are too damn fast.
[0:28:06] <%kurby301> rollback for everything pls
[0:28:06] <%Xeltos_> If you have PS+ and got the game for free than you can just buy the DLC pack for 10$ and get customization stuff
[0:28:07] <%kungfupinoy> I think we need a network pf FGC Sattelites.
[0:28:09] <%BBboy20> Though, this been figured out like, what 13 years ago?

[0:28:12] <elementor374> Didn't SEGA said that the Dragon engine is difficult to work with? maybe at first when they were first using it yakuza 6 but idk if it's still difficult for them....
[0:28:14] <Zeo_Nav> for Money they will spread the love among other things
[0:28:15] <+WinterHammerEntertainment> Welp that sucks, I had one  in but someone claimed it before I could, lol.
[0:28:15] <L337m0j0> if sega puts the $ into the devs to learn they would be fine......
[0:28:16] <+crybirb> @valkgurlukavich having GGPO open sourced isn't the end of all solutions

[0:31:04] <%dedpup> @RagnaXBL sorry to hear that man
[0:31:05] <%ReKalibrate> I think they try to connect you somewhere in the middle, not close to you, so you have the same delay. I think
[0:31:05] <%staticshock5> Weird. I was getting some great connections when I picked any
[0:31:05] <%JIVEB0T> @NightMGA He does but he is not interested in it
[0:31:06] <%zane_dye> @Maximilian_DOOD When i played with my friends in Japan i would ping at JGA-S Australia

[0:31:11] <%MightySandwich> Why hello everyone
[0:31:11] <%Senju_in_Japan> Did you match in wakanda?
[0:31:12] <%C24U> Solution or alternative?
[0:31:13] <nazirr_> Most likely Nigeria
[0:31:13] <Pixygonalated> @laoesper I was thinking about that, but tbh most of us live near the border anyway.
[0:31:14] <%BaronBattle> its...ABSORB
[0:31:14] <%Otoshi_Gami> Yep. its no ROLLBACK
[0:31:15] <vesmoper> !netduma

[0:31:15] <%cubbywolf> too late
[0:31:16] <%Bustaperizm> is that a Taiwan server?
[0:31:16] <%SamuraiPoet88> That Server is Nigeria or Cameroon Africa
[0:31:17] <%Ithapher> Is it sustainable?
[0:31:18] <%Monkiebrainz> It's a good temporary answer @Maximilian_DOOD
[0:31:19] <nonamenat3> Could this be given a separate title?
[0:31:20] <%Fettouhi> the question si if sage can control this. google probably has an SLA but can't promise if you always get the closet server
[0:31:21] <%Resident_Stevil> A "solution"
[0:31:22] <%BBboy20> So, Cameroon holding it down?
[0:31:23] <+Danyfighter> guys, KOF Is delayed to 2022

[0:31:30] <@NYCrownlessKing> this sounds like a solution to delay, that sounds too costly is simply what i think @Maximilian_DOOD

[0:31:46] <Shinon17> @bloodyantares is it actually playable tho? my psn just expired and I'm debating paying again if it works
[0:31:49] <%Otoshi_Gami> absorbing ther delay hype :P
[0:31:49] <%JIVEB0T> @NightMGA yw
[0:31:55] <RebirthCrusader> Poor Australia man
[0:31:57] <SlimeRthyme> I think its the African server because the earygs round so that server is inbetween  US an europe
[0:31:58] <Og_wolfslayer> sega is next level with this fan interactions
[0:32:00] <%Resident_Stevil> @ChrisRG21 I can't look at Austrailia.  If I do, it will try to kill me.

[0:32:02] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.

[0:32:03] <CommanderSqueaks> So how long is Sega going be willing to fund this and what happens when they get rid of the servers? Will the online just tank completely?
[0:32:03] <%switch_treamer> @Maximilian_DOOD have you actually run test on your own network to see where your WAN connects?
[0:32:04] <%untrustbuild> hello @xyberkn1ght doodShine doodBro chilledLove doodShine doodBro

[0:32:26] <%nenjutsutv> So in summary: Its Better Delay based Netcode. But still delay based Netcode and not Rollback
[0:32:26] <%Otoshi_Gami> Stable kinda :p
[0:32:27] <wetstud> wassup food seen you on YouTube an watched your tournaments. So I added
[0:32:27] <NightMGA> @xyberKn1ght Figured he had signed up to try it on an emulator
[0:32:27] <Uberejho> @Maximilian_DOOD no wifi indicator is really big though
[0:32:29] <%Agent00Shoe> every shooter under the sun works this way, totally substainable
[0:32:29] <+ssnarlymango> @Wiiplayah43 trash
[0:32:29] <GTelias2212> there's no Latin America servers if they got a solution to that then is a win but for now if you are from Latin America i don't recommend you the game just go with Guilty Gear Strive or many indie fighting games
[0:32:30] <%xerotwo> China and Russia tho LUL
[0:32:31] <%Lemdree> can we combine rollback and absorb? it'll be aqtual fortune telling

[0:32:38] <%Z3r0Fear> hi everyone! Sorry for being late to the stream got distracted watching an amazingly talented twitch singer.
[0:32:41] <%red_cuppa> it definitely reads like they're aware and just weren't able to make it rollback presumably for skill
[0:32:43] <CommanderSqueaks> So will online in VF5 just tank completely once they stop paying for the servers?
[0:32:44] <r3mmant> Developing rollback would be cheeper I think

[0:33:01] <%MoonxLxght> matchmaking is funky for me :(
[0:33:03] <%retrozaid> @ToraWrathUwU Yoooo Tora!! doodBro doodHey doodBro doodSweet doodBro doodDerp doodDrool
[0:33:03] <%NoobasaurusWrexx> Dev who worked on Mortal Kombat 9's matchmaking and lobby system here. I wonder if they did the same thing we did, where we had a service in between players that matched them together and allowed them to communicate between matches, then connected them peer to peer for the match. Players stayed connected to our systems to do stat tracking during the match, which would explain why you are seeing an intermediary server while playing, but not always.
[0:33:03] <%MightySandwich> Seems like an awful lot of investment for just *one* fighting game… dekillPlan
[0:33:03] <%PseuDEEnym> thats how pokken was
[0:33:03] <%BLUEsmoke00> I was looking at specs on the dragon engine SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:33:06] <%real_kdubya> We need Perth servers for Australia... can't stand only connecting to Sydney.
[0:33:07] <greycreeze2345> we are at the honeymoon period of matchmaking
[0:33:11] <kefka_himself> yeah
[0:33:11] <+Bravetriforcer> Matchmaking doesn't even work quick for me. 5+ minutes to get amatch, living in the US

[0:33:19] <%ToraWrathUwU> doodDerp
[0:33:20] <%XVEthan> Once the player base dies down won't this theoretically crash and burn even harder than even traditional delay based though
[0:33:21] <%Otoshi_Gami> Take notes @SEGA and send it to HIGHER UPS :p
[0:33:24] <%quique_schz> @Maximilian_DOOD maybe they are using servers that they already have, like for PSO?
[0:33:24] <livinlavidalevin> This feels like their probably working on roll back in sega right now and this is just a hold over till it’s done or if their holding another game close to their chest
[0:33:25] <%moistnevada> @holygriddles  miracles DO happen doodbenny
[0:33:27] <+SephirothRK> I'm setting my connection to BEST and it give me a person with full bars which is a lie
[0:33:31] <CalderGaming> @Naiko_32 google cloud does, but that doesn't necessarily mean Sega is using it for VF5US
[0:33:32] <@ChrisRG21> is this games netcode like tekken 7?
[0:33:33] <Pixygonalated> @greycreeze2345 Nice analogy
[0:33:33] <Neoxon> @maximilian_dood MK9 dev is in the chat

[0:33:40] <%wizchiefa23> Hi sega
[0:33:41] <Apocalypsehigh> i had a spot where i had to wait a hot minute for a match

[0:33:46] <+Malthivarius> @SEGA  rematch!
[0:33:47] <Wild_Samurai> first time ive enjoyed Virtua Fighter ever. And they gave this game free the last 2 generations
[0:33:49] <%Retribution888> Sega is speed-running through GreenHill Zone to get us more codes
[0:33:51] <@xyberKn1ght> @NightMGA Max doesn't regularly use emulator for Android on games that aren't straight forward downloadable and available. It's possible it may be considered after the game releases. Currently as someone who is testing it, it's got some bland issues.
[0:33:52] <RagnaXBL> meanwhile in Africa...
[0:33:53] <%Otoshi_Gami> @Maximilian_DOOD agreed. Hence VF6
[0:33:53] <%xIronPonyx> @SEGA excited for the next batch :D
[0:33:54] <600greenknight> @SEGA Chat demands more codes, please, with your favorite dairy treat?
[0:33:55] <@ChrisRG21> havent tried vf 5 us because no PC port
[0:33:56] <%SEGA> @wizchiefa23 oh hi
[0:33:57] <%sycthediem> VF6 rollback Kreygasm
[0:33:57] <superfamycom> But SFV is ROLLBACK NotLikeThis
[0:33:57] <+Clawmaster_> Isn't Rollback free?
[0:33:58] <+sol_badguy27> @ChrisRG21 To our knowledge, Tekken 7 doesn't seem to use relay servers.
[0:33:58] <%DreamPhantasyTV> bet you they won't doodSad
[0:33:59] <KhaosK_UL> netcode now is good but can be better
[0:34:00] <%BillyNaing> so would you say it's like playing parsec with rented servers. but you have no control of where the servers are? @Maximilian_DOOD
[0:34:00] <DreamBoss__> sega chillin in chat CoolCat
[0:34:01] <dotelf> rollback + edge servers tho Kreygasm
[0:34:02] <supersonic91> @sega Thanks for the games to the west!
[0:34:03] <GTelias2212> maybe Virtua Fighter 6 if VF5US success?
[0:34:04] <Vashido22> @Maximilian_DOOD could the way VF's buffer works help with the rollback?
[0:34:04] <Shinon17> @bloodyantares I was expecting horrible here in south America, so I guess that sounds good enough LUL
[0:34:04] <+striker199> on usage
[0:34:05] <CommanderSqueaks> This seems like a bandaid that's going to fall off sooner than later and leave online for this game being unplayable once they decide to stop paying for the servers.
[0:34:06] <Settles32> @sega I’m too slow at getting a code :(
[0:34:08] <%FeralRanchu> It’s just provisioning VMs on demand that act as dedicated game host, and destroying them when it’s not needed. I am a cloud architect at Microsoft @maximilian_dood
[0:34:08] <%Setsuna_GN> Cost of renting the servers would outweigh the cost of developing rollback after a certain time frame
[0:34:08] <%Lemdree> when sega stops paying for these servers, the game is dead
[0:34:09] <%DarKaoZ> @chrisrg21 I'll say better, but not by a lot.
[0:34:09] <%BBboy20> Rollback, RTX, most realistic clothe physics ever would be expected for a VF6

[0:36:08] <%Shadowdragon899> As someone who constantly plays Tekken, I can agree.
[0:36:08] <%iamtherook> did the audio change for anyone else, or just me?
[0:36:09] <$merrowlink20> VF5UC is more fun than T7.
[0:36:09] <%jahy000sama> backroll netcode
[0:36:10] <Xelae93> It also helps that there isn't 5 minutes of loading between every game.

[0:37:00] <Neoxon> @sega Please tell the devs that we want VF6 with rollback netcode more nationalities represented (Ex: Eritrea, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Brazil, etc.).

[0:39:38] <%TheFrank88> REJECT ROLLBACK. ABSORB THE LAG
[0:39:38] <%Koagz> @SEGA you guys are doing great evo17Heart
[0:39:40] <%deathspit00> VIRTUA FIGHTER REBIRTH WITH ROLLBACK! We want this. Tell the higher ups. Thank you for the codes and supplying the early copy for us to enjoy the streams. @sega
[0:39:41] <EmperorVon> KappaWealth
[0:39:41] <Brindle_Stryker> can i get code for sega dreamcast 2 EleGiggle MingLee LUL
[0:39:42] <%PJSmooth> They cut a lot of corners to get the game out
[0:39:42] <buddy26boi> This games sick
[0:39:43] <wetstud> Killer instinct gold is better than killer instinct on xbox
[0:39:43] <%zane_dye> I think this is what VF need though. I hope we can get a VF6 out of this and I know RGG wants it too.
[0:39:44] <%Retribution888> I'm always at the checkout screen when I get robbed LUL
[0:39:45] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood Also the VF5FS had like 20 or more slots for outfits, now we have 4 NotLikeThis
[0:39:45] <DreamBoss__> SEGA lurkin hard af rn

[0:39:46] <%cubbywolf> @sega love total war series woo
[0:39:47] <%Gastonxeneise> SEEEEEGGGAAAAAAA
[0:39:48] <ToobustaKomb0> you'll kill at tournament, max
[0:39:48] <600greenknight> @SEGA @NYCrownlessKing those codes are already used
[0:39:48] <%TheArnett> @Maximilian_DOOD I think that a key thing is that it is necessary to acknowledge what can be better but it is also necessary to acknowledge what was done well.
[0:39:49] <JFpaes15> VF5US unfortunately have a bunch of features missing that were available on previous versions from what I heard
[0:39:50] <N30NxL1T3x> I miss Tekken's old title screens
[0:39:51] <Macmangrillum12> fighting vipers would be sick
[0:39:52] <+Gandy_Man> Sega we know you can do it gandymBless @SEGA
[0:39:55] <%SEGA> @rotarylover89 <3
[0:39:55] <$merrowlink20> @SEGA When is PSO2 coming west for PS4?
[0:39:56] <Mixoops> They have to be added more stuff, they just knew ppl wanted to play so they just sent it out, right?
[0:39:56] <%yhmjack1> yeah, looking at Strive LUL
[0:39:57] <FluffyMcBear> @SEGA Really looking forward for PSO2NGS
[0:39:57] <Lyshty> @Maximilian_DOOD what about in a few years, if they shut down the servers. Then its back to normal delay righty?
[0:39:59] <MonoSpider> @Maximilian_DOOD Did you hear KOF 15 got delayed to 2022?
[0:39:59] <mikeozzy98> The title screen replays are such a vibe but I dont end up playing and just sit there and watch
[0:39:59] <%Darnell16player> @SEGA  The fans want to see you guys succeed!
[0:39:59] <BlaxShazam> @Maximilian_DOOD tournament is already in the game
[0:40:00] <+Mewgusta> wish I could just invite
[0:40:00] <%TampaNeverSleeps> I wish VF got more love in tourneys
[0:40:02] <@NYCrownlessKing> we gotta make sure they're all used. duhh @600greenknight
[0:40:08] <hal90000> Watch and learn ArcSys this is how you do a good Lobbuy
[0:40:08] <CarmineAcciai> Bring Yakuza Ishin to the US!
[0:40:11] <@NYCrownlessKing> don't beg for codes chat
[0:40:12] <RebirthCrusader> I cooked chicken nuggets in the oven and ate them all since the beginning of this talk lol
[0:40:14] <sn0wcie> It;s just like the XBOX/Playstation case again LUL
[0:40:15] <%HiroesX81> Also yo @Maximilian_DOOD doodGood
[0:40:18] <elementor374> So basically: Delay Based Netcode  <  Absorb Delay Netcode  <  Rollback Netcode
[0:40:19] <%TampaNeverSleeps> TampaNeverSleeps subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Sega please step up
[0:40:19] <Whorror> @SEGA i love you :)
[0:40:20] <%Bedskirts> anybody see how KI is still at Evo?
[0:40:20] <saigram23> hell yeah people getting shot
[0:40:22] <HouseWD> @SEGA and a steam version if thats not much to ask, thank you
[0:40:26] <%staticshock5> Honestly this is my first VF and so far I'm enjoying it
[0:40:26] <%ToraWrathUwU> inlidibe...what doodDerp
[0:40:27] <%cubbywolf> once you touch rollback you cant go back
[0:40:29] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Chat: Don't go bothering/harassing the Sega account. aliwayGun
[0:40:29] <$merrowlink20> @SEGA also, I love you
[0:40:31] <%ImTarco> Yeah opting to pay for servers of all the options is just weird.
[0:40:32] <%TheKSyndicate> Sup doods!!!
[0:40:32] <giri26> chat really want codes
[0:40:32] <psyphon11> @SEGA <3
[0:40:33] <%VZLABoi> @600greenknight  well there 12k people hammering those codes, of course they go fast
[0:40:33] <CommanderSqueaks> What's going to happen to online play once they stop paying for the servers, however?
[0:40:36] <%leomuratore> @sega Thank you for so many incredible games, and being part of my life.
[0:40:38] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Jesus people.
[0:40:40] <average_kd_buddy> Crossplay on console is also crucial to balancing a dwindling player base, which is inevitable atpQuan
[0:40:42] <%SquallAdv> @SEGA I love you forever! <3
[0:40:43] <%NualphaJPN> SEGA <3
[0:40:46] <JBallsMahoney> rooGun
[0:40:46] <%Dwilly253> but you're saying it won't last
[0:40:47] <+sol_badguy27> Great game, SEGA! However, it seems that the Kick player from lobby button doesn't seem to work either, let's hope it gets fixed soon.
[0:40:49] <SakeAndMiyazaki> Chat being sluts for codes
[0:40:49] <+Gertew> "FREE"
[0:40:49] <%Otoshi_Gami> @Maximilian_DOOD Agreed :)

[0:40:54] <+Gionnelles> y'all gonna make me DL this game... I haven't played VF since 1-2?
[0:40:54] <@NYCrownlessKing> guys, there are different departments to marketing. Sega twitch does not have game development.
[0:40:54] <%BloodyAntares> I mean if there is a time to revive VF, its naw
[0:40:54] <Autaki> !vf5
[0:40:54] <%switch_treamer> "free"
[0:40:54] <+red_the_potato> Did you hear about KOF being delayed?
[0:40:54] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[0:40:55] <%SnipingMonkey> @SEGA Daytona remake when oddoneHmm
[0:40:56] <Doublenyher> how long is it free for?

[0:41:14] <JakDax321> I had pretty good connections but I don't play enough fighting games to recognize around 5 frames of delay
[0:41:15] <RasenRendan> SEGA you guys are GOATs i dont need codes just saying thank you
[0:41:16] <+manizmgh> Is VF only on ps4??

[0:41:21] <@Nightbot> Check out our latest merch! Shirts, posters, mugs and more - https://maxdood.tv/merch
[0:41:21] <+Drdevice81> Sega decides to back nice and chat become sharks smelling blood
[0:41:22] <zzz_nuke> rip kof 15
[0:41:22] <@NYCrownlessKing> There is a studio working on the game for you to tweet guys, Sega on twitch probably only handles  marketing.
[0:41:23] <%orlyorz> LETS GOOOOOO VIRTUA FIGHTER FOREVER BABY @SEGA
[0:41:23] <junkiedolemite74> Kof 15 delayed until 2022
[0:41:23] <%moistnevada> @cubbywolf one you rollback, you can never go back… except in a match
[0:41:24] <%thatCRAZYrooster> @Brunty023 doodBro doodBro doodBro
[0:41:25] <nonamenat3> Could the method they are using rather than rollback netcode be called something separate?
[0:41:25] <Gatmuz> Kinda sus, sustaining servers on the revenue of a free game with 10 dollar dlc
[0:41:25] <%UltimateAzure> $30 if you get the game + pack deal
[0:41:26] <Whorror> mktomBRADYGO mktomBRADYGO mktomBRADYGO mktomBRADYGO mktomHaharaiden
[0:41:26] <%xIronPonyx> actually game is normally $30 i think @Maximilian_DOOD
[0:41:26] <%DarKaoZ> 2 Months iirc
[0:41:27] <+Siosefa> 20 is still a steal
[0:41:27] <$juliansitobae> Are you playing today ?
[0:41:28] <%thewb32018> @thatCRAZYrooster doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro
[0:41:28] <Neoxon> @sega Also, if VF6 happens, throw in some LGBTQ+ characters in addition to more nationalities.
[0:41:29] <+Malthivarius> ah well, screw it.  $13 CAD is worth it too, I don't mind giving them my money
[0:41:30] <%zane_dye> RGG is hoping for a VF future. <3
[0:41:30] <%AkumaMatataX_X> sucks that the "free" version doesnt come with the customization options unless u get the legendary edition
[0:41:30] <el_scarecrow> My only criticism of virtua fighter is that sonic isn’t in it.
[0:41:31] <%hottubtimemachine69> $20 isn’t bad at all tbh
[0:41:32] <Bigoroth_RPG> They could have solved the invitations issue very well, if only they had added an option to filter rooms between friends as well. Because besides, there is a filter to see your friends, but it's only in the rankings. :/
[0:41:32] <%TheKSyndicate> @Halfolympian It's on Plus & Now
[0:41:33] <@Viewtifulotaku7> ..

[0:46:10] <%MadDokGrotsnik> @Maximilian_DOOD Did you see the news about the post launch modes for Strive. Sounds like the tag mode might actually be a thing post launch
[0:46:12] <%CHAPLAINsdx> Crazy Taxi Fighters?!
[0:46:12] <+RunoEddie> too bad KI was strapped to the bad PR of the Xbone's launch, maybe it could have changed stuff

[0:46:19] <Jag3rKhan> @SEGA The megadrive was my first console ever and brought me in the gaming world, good times indeed (street fighter II and street of rage 3 specially)
[0:46:19] <cheetah1546> This is fun to talk about

[0:46:23] <%PseuDEEnym> VF needs a reboot

[0:46:32] <$CeeJayOrJustC> BEAT EM' UPS needs to come back to Fighting Games! DansGame
[0:46:32] <%zane_dye> VF6 needs FV characters and Daytona cars
[0:46:34] <%XionBarzhad> Treat it similar to DoA Core Fighters? @Maximilian_DOOD But hopefully without the scummy DLC prices.
[0:46:36] <%coingray> Agreed. It's such a complex game, it's really helpful to have the option to try it out for no risk.
[0:46:36] <ConservativeMindset> true
[0:46:36] <%HiroesX81> @SEGA XD Hopefully!
[0:46:37] <%ryokupo> All fighting games should be F2P
[0:46:37] <@Leon_Tekashi> Definitely a good call.

[0:46:38] <jukebox2014> after burner
[0:46:39] <%Otoshi_Gami> @Maximilian_DOOD Pretty much
[0:46:39] <+thiagogf94> was there ever a conversation about tekken x VF?
[0:46:39] <%jonboy204> All fighting games should be F2P then. Why make a fighting game Pay 2 Play
[0:46:39] <%xIronPonyx> @Maximilian_DOOD do u know the difference between the VF5US PS+ VERSION versus the paid version?
[0:46:41] <%Lemdree> i think vf5us is a vf send-off
[0:46:41] <Batfax> Fighters Megamix 2 and with Phantasy Star on the roster this time.
[0:46:41] <DzyZ_> @SEGA love you guys and what you guys do!

[0:46:46] <computer_321> hey @sega is the DLC only meant as an addition to the PS Plus game? because the full game is only available with the DLC included
[0:46:46] <RayBladeX> Fighters Megamix w/dragon engine.
[0:46:46] <+hawk52> The problem with that is devs have a hard time drawing the line between fair F2P models and price gouging for every single aspect.
[0:46:46] <+DI3GOMU> KOF GOT DELAYED
[0:46:47] <+xogossipgirl> Hello xogossAkechi

[0:47:02] <%moistnevada> @runoeddie if its any comfort, it DID have an impact. It was the first big FG to have a season pass model of characters/maps
[0:47:03] <$chrono_specter> As long as there is enough Characters at launch
[0:47:03] <%angeluriel1530> Is it free to get out?

[0:47:09] <prettystardoll> Yeah
[0:47:09] <%Bealy_beal> It's often expensive when a fighting game comes out with a character you like.
[0:47:12] <+armormog> Exactly. The biggest accessibility option is f2p
[0:47:12] <%thatCRAZYrooster> you mean Xbox One?
[0:47:13] <%mdsmith> ETERNAL CHAMPIONS!!!?????!!!!????
[0:47:13] <%Bedskirts> brawlhalla uses the KI model as well

[0:47:15] <%jv5_guy> SEGA!!!!
[0:47:15] <+jamuck> sfv costumes was massive profit
[0:47:17] <RebirthCrusader> 360 hype
[0:47:18] <%C24U> Should DLC fighters be free as well or cost money as well as cosmetics?
[0:47:18] <Kreiben46> SNK twitter announced today
[0:47:19] <+Rollllllll> Absolutely, but Bandai and Capcom... don't have much faith there.

[0:47:21] <superfamycom> @Maximilian_DOOD  But VF historically was an AAA cutting edge game. SEGA's technical showcase.. :( I don't want a F2P

[0:49:39] <%Bedskirts> they saw the reaction to the VF netcode and said "okay we gotta do rollback."
[0:49:39] <%jahy000sama> thank god
[0:49:40] <gunstars20> makes sense
[0:49:42] <%jsf_zack> plus they also need to just have like a sitdown livestream or something to explain mechanics
[0:49:42] <legal_name_change> Might be working on the graphics more @Maximilian_DOOD
[0:49:46] <%Deezskee> got my j&j shot today, shoulder sore and a little tired
[0:49:46] <%MisterMukkey> It will have more room to breathe not coming out the same year as GG Strive and VF5
[0:49:46] <RocTager> SNK Shattered expectations by actually taking responsibility.
[0:49:46] <%HiroesX81> someone delay something in June doodLUL

[0:49:55] <cheetah1546> The industry learned from cyberpunk you dont need an exact release date
[0:49:56] <%moistnevada> great appetizer for 2022 games!
[0:49:57] <%Murgurth> I hope they improve the lighting by the time the comes out, the animations I can ignore, but the lighting and VFX can use work
[0:49:59] <+Sticky80sbaby> more time for strive
[0:49:59] <%deathspit00> It still needs Beta tests anyway. Server Stress tests, Chat.

[1:04:39] <%cubbywolf> if its too a server then yeah it would vary
[1:04:39] <SkiDaBopBop> Canadian Internet can be bad

[1:04:59] <An_Ordinary_Fox> Oh I forgot Max has SUPERFIBER!
[1:05:00] <%VZLABoi> @zerointelligence000  No, is delay based with relay servers
[1:05:01] <%TheEvilSonny> Hey max
[1:05:01] <%igotrhythm> @Sebastian19321 Could be any number of reasons. No interest, didn't teach it in school, lack of societal emphasis...I could go on, but it would get political in a hurry

[1:05:15] <%MegafanX> how does that work? does it just randomly add delay regardless of distance? Like you would think you couldn't play someone in Asia at 5F if eastern Canada gets 10F
[1:05:15] <%Astrophizz> sounds like the relay is closer to Max "-/
[1:05:19] <giri26> oh fuck

[1:06:58] <@PatStaresAt> I'm having my Forward+PP occasionally come out with no forward
[1:06:59] <%Man_in_the_Red> doesnt he live next to one of the relays

[1:07:04] <$tloa> @hawk52 he definitely does not, if it was 10-12 frames it would be noticable
[1:07:05] <+Taisuru> It's weird that it can be different per player
[1:07:05] <BimboBagging> the worst thing of living near the coast is that half your range is just empty ocean
[1:07:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yea, you can see Pat has some bad delay. He keeps trying a combo and missing it
[1:07:07] <%Resident_Stevil> @maximilian_dood Maybe if you make the room, you'll get a different server.
[1:07:07] <+Lord0Mugen> Its ABSORBENT! For your pleasure!

[1:07:33] <Dentroy69> How come some characters look good and some polymorphic
[1:07:34] <%MisterMukkey> So does Pat just live in a really bad spot in terms of the placement of servers around the world? im confused
[1:07:37] <%VZLABoi> @Romarick1990  remember is not only montreal internet, the connection is as good as the "Worse" portion of the connection. you can have gigabit most of the way but if a portion is 10mbit that is the max speed.

[1:18:40] <+sol_badguy27> @Leon_Tekashi She has the most counter moves in the game.
[1:18:41] <%Calek> @spinzza not even a little bit
[1:18:41] <Zeo_Nav> Under water Netcode
[1:18:42] <%PseuDEEnym> brock lesnar
[1:18:47] <Jaku2011> @Leon_Tekashi Counter Sabaki character like Lei Fang in DOA
[1:18:49] <LLADNAR> was that a Brock Lesnar F5? lol
[1:18:49] <kizknife> @Leon_Tekashi She's a bit like Asuka from Tekken
[1:18:49] <+PrasF1> Wolf Brockfield Kappa
[1:18:50] <Wild_Samurai> everyone feels great except Akira, the main character lol
[1:18:51] <%OlivePowerRanger> @leon_tekashi great character but good luck countering online
[1:18:51] <%wizchiefa23> Kiyah bitch doodSurvive
[1:18:51] <%untrustbuild> that's a broken neck
[1:18:52] <%VZLABoi> @spinzza  no, is delay based with use of relay servers
[1:18:53] <+m4dness87> @spinzza delay based
[1:18:55] <%spinzza> ohhh
[1:18:59] <%TKScoops> nice fafnir to fafnir
[1:19:03] <+Basilias_Maximus> @spinzza Delay based with the help of servers.
[1:19:05] <TheRealShifty> the low-polygon skin was holding him back
[1:19:05] <%FanaticalMilk> @spinzza They've said it's not, it's "absorb netcode" and uses a Parsec-like system based around's Google's server relays
[1:19:05] <+BlueSixes> angle slam!
[1:19:06] <+aleslo> YOUR DYING
[1:19:07] <%plasmabowser> I'm in Mexico can't find matches near me doodTaco
[1:19:09] <%FrosTKoi> Backdash cancels? Like KBD?
[1:19:09] <%xsynthwavex> the king of virtua fighter
[1:19:09] <t_hawk_typhoon> @Leon_Tekashi Aoi is all about counters. She has many different counter moves and a stance that counters everything except lows
[1:19:10] <@Leon_Tekashi> All about hard reads. Hmm...
[1:19:17] <+Taisuru> All characters are good, Jacky is the best :V
[1:19:19] <%ReKalibrate> Aoi is sick but you have to be a mind reader to play her well, she's sick tho
[1:19:21] <%omegaweapon155> @Leon_Tekashi  aoi is a very counter heavy based character with some neat evasive options
[1:19:23] <hujkull> @Leon_Tekashi she is a defensive beast , can reverse everything in the game , and has cancel strings and good throws
[1:19:25] <%cubbywolf> TOTSUGEKI
[1:19:26] <@ChrisRG21> wonder if asuka also did Wolf's mocap as well
[1:19:28] <%bustahwulf170> I forget, does Wolf have a Musclebuster equivalent?
[1:19:29] <Melon_Bread_Enthusiast> yee boi let's go
[1:19:36] <%saltmachineto> @Leon_Tekashi There are no terrible characters in VF, so if you're fine with playing a defensive counter-heavy playstyle, she's your jam.
[1:19:38] <AestheticVampire> I actually mained wolf in 2
[1:19:40] <%BrokemanJ> El Blaze any good?
[1:19:41] <+frogblogdogfrog> @Maximilian_DOOD pretty deep game huh?
[1:19:41] <PROUDLEFTY> Goh mains where you at?

[1:19:49] <@NYCrownlessKing> LUL
[1:19:52] <Jag3rKhan> Clap
[1:19:52] <OptimusCack> aoi rewards defensive play, and she has ways of getting bigger rewards for how specific your defensive guesses
[1:19:53] <$Pompidou1990> i don't know what people expect, east coast to west coast is going to be difficult regardless of the game
[1:19:54] <+sol_badguy27> She did Vanessa too.
[1:19:56] <+Guto_Martins> She said Vanessa
[1:19:58] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:20:00] <greycreeze2345> She did Vanessa's mo cap
[1:20:00] <%MichaelDood> Nobody is ready for Asuka.

[1:20:12] <@NYCrownlessKing> Asuka said she did alot of character mocaps.
[1:20:13] <Estegard> Wolf looks great! He has F5, Saito Suplex...
[1:20:14] <@NYCrownlessKing> not just Vanessa
[1:20:19] <LeoSageTV> jean is devil jin but better
[1:20:19] <Quikanims> Jean is so extra
[1:20:22] <%Onyx_13k> The hitting sounds in this game are so satisfying to hear
[1:20:25] <CommanderSqueaks> Pat said turn down the pepper LUL
[1:20:25] <Hbk970> Kana is a blessing, she did great on mo cap
[1:20:26] <jukebox2014> all the wrestler??
[1:20:29] <%StriderTempxa> Asuka the wrestler?
[1:20:29] <+weadoe> east coast to west coast can be fine, anyone telling you otherwise is lying
[1:20:29] <DrkJP520> I think she did Wolf as well
[1:20:30] <SalvadorZombie> wait, Asuka the wrestler?
[1:20:34] <@NYCrownlessKing> yes
[1:20:35] <dave4703> so, does this game work well or not?
[1:20:36] <%herkule0001> Just proves how awesome Asuka chan is
[1:20:37] <%predac0n> what  if his name was Hawk Wolffield

[1:20:47] <+DK_MisterFly> ReBuen (Dante) does a ton of RE mocap
[1:20:50] <%Westt_Lives_ToPlay> it's be dope if they got Rey Mysterio to mo-cap for El blaze doodDerp doodDerp

[1:20:51] <TortillaGub> me
[1:20:52] <Apothecary2> how would she do wolf? she's too short for that
[1:20:53] <%FrosTKoi> i think i'm gonna feel like home in VF5 after Tekken tbh
[1:20:54] <%herkule0001> Yes Asuka/Kana the wrassler chat
[1:20:56] <%Brunty023> @SalvadorZombie Yup! She went by Kana at the time when the game was out
[1:20:56] <Zeo_Nav> El Cancer El netcode
[1:20:56] <%sycthediem> Asuka is so dang cool doodThirst
[1:20:59] <%PFlare> Yup. She even Tweeted about it herself.
[1:20:59] <%BigCez32> El blaze was another wrestler called Hawk
[1:21:00] <@NYCrownlessKing> you don't do mocap for an entire moveset chat. just moves you could perform well in your line of expertise.
[1:21:02] <wetstud> An we pay an they get millions from every user using internet
[1:21:03] <Justice_213> i dont remember a "jean" is this a custom character?
[1:21:06] <%bustahwulf170> Yo, Wolf's knee is HELLA fast.
[1:21:06] <%BigUnc_at_the_bbq> WWE Asuka?
[1:21:07] <%CaptainAmazing> this theme Kreygasm
[1:21:08] <%transmarxist> I keep hearing airplanes flying over head, or maybe its just VF
[1:21:09] <%jsf_zack> is goh a decent character to start out with chat? or is he a little bit more on the difficult side? im a newbie to vf lol
[1:21:09] <kobura57> Max can already do the Jean unblockables ????
[1:21:09] <%plasmabowser> @dave4703 depends. I had 50 50 matches

[1:21:30] <SalvadorZombie> that makes sense, she's a wrestling legend and she LOVES video games @Brunty023
[1:21:30] <%PFlare> @Apothecary2 That's not how mocap works. You don't need to be exact to mocap the general animation for characters.
[1:21:34] <Estegard> Wait. Are you telling me THE Kana did mocap for this? That the most PogChamp thing I've read in months
[1:21:35] <%Resident_Stevil> @untrustbuild Have a good one  doodBro doodShine reside1Mike
[1:21:37] <+Siosefa> @untrustbuild g'night
[1:21:41] <PureYeti> @jsf_zack I heard he is a good beginner char
[1:21:41] <%Frizen_101> @Apothecary2 you don't need to look like the person to mocap them. They just need the movements
[1:21:41] <%Man_in_the_Red> no this is Jeane from no more heroes
[1:21:42] <+BloodBerry_> @jsf_zack if you think he's cool play him
[1:21:43] <%Brunty023> @untrustbuild Have a good night, Untrust! doodBro doodBro

[1:21:54] <AestheticVampire> this part of the song Kreygasm
[1:21:56] <%TheOGB> @Apothecary2 the devs alter the data after capturing, so that's no issue. humans mocap for dragons and shit all the time
[1:21:56] <%akaMr_Wick> PAWNCH
[1:22:00] <StormtrooperdeAimbot> laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaariaaaaaaaaaaat
[1:22:01] <+TheDestinyPotato> @jsf_zack He's pretty easy to pick up aside from needing to know about his grab stuff
[1:22:04] <%PFlare> @Apothecary2 It's standard to mocap the general motions and then touch them up manually later.
[1:22:07] <%Zin_o_vision> clothesline heard across the world, geez!!
[1:22:08] <%Kohai_Teigu> asleepyWoah
[1:22:08] <Apothecary2> wolf is a grappler and is taller than the people he grapples
[1:22:09] <kurikirinton> PAT
[1:22:12] <computer_321> @tonsOFfunZ virtuafighter dot com
[1:22:13] <ammobasket> Mocap gives really good animation reference, but it still takes cleanup.
[1:22:20] <%Brunty023> @killarswitch PGK right after you sidestep.
[1:22:20] <+RonnieDobbs69> stone cold stunner
[1:22:21] <t_hawk_typhoon> I thought this was Jean Grey from the X-men

[1:25:30] <+junfansavaria> WHAT IS THE KEY DIFFERENCE WITH TEKKEN 7?!?
[1:25:31] <theyamchad> Add Kasumi since VF characters were in DOA
[1:25:32] <%oddprototype> why is he so pretty??
[1:25:33] <Kreiben46> Loading times in this game are lighting fast, compared to Tekken 7

[1:26:12] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[1:26:13] <Saikyo_Analysis> @junfansavaria this is a two-button-fighter + dedicated block button
[1:26:14] <+sol_badguy27> It's unfortunate the Yakuza creator doesn't want Kiryu in, but Majima fits entirely.

[1:29:43] <@ChrisRG21> @bennythejet504 more like NJPW wrestler
[1:29:44] <%nenjutsutv> How would it be if they added DLC characters in this game? I know they want to retain the VF5 spirit but im interested to see how a situation like that would be handled (probably wont happen tho)
[1:29:45] <%inajefflymanner> Wolf's kick has such a good weight to it when it lands

[1:40:00] <%Brunty023> @Prabability No fighting games at all, since Nagoshi doesn't want to see Kiryu hitting women
[1:40:05] <%Dwang> @Prabability Nope, Series director always stated he didn't like the idea of Kiryu beating girls in fighting games
[1:40:05] <%bustahwulf170> @Prabability Probably not. the Yakuza director doesn't want Kiryu fighting women.

[1:43:01] <%Sulfur_Boride> Akira is Bajiquan, b/c of the elbow and shoulder strikes
[1:43:01] <black_mishima> so akira isn't like judo or something?
[1:43:02] <%kungfupinoy> Tekken has long combos and no block button, not the same.

[1:43:14] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Akira isn't Chinese nor does he use Judo cirHuh
[1:43:15] <+stormhowl_fgc> Akira is from Shenmue
[1:43:15] <%Kildaedra> Akira looks like your typical karate dude, but nah
[1:43:15] <+krazy_swayze> Akira does some form of Hakko-ken or some crap like that.
[1:43:17] <%Dwang> @FredIsBread Nope, That's Goh who uses Judo
[1:43:18] <KSDM> SourPls
[1:43:20] <lordlord07> akira's style is the one-frame-link
[1:43:23] <@Nightbot> Watch our YoVideogames stream archives on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/yovideogames
[1:43:23] <AdrianSkira> Akira uses Bajiquan
[1:43:24] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Oh my God, chat.
[1:43:24] <%nenjutsutv> YOOOOO
[1:43:25] <Brindle_Stryker> he dont seem like karate :p
[1:43:26] <+RonnieDobbs69> kumite! kumite! kumite!
[1:43:27] <%sycthediem> It's  kinda refreshing  not having supers in a fighter, imo
[1:43:27] <beefcakemanthrob> akira fights using baijiquan. same as kokoro in doa
[1:43:33] <elementor374> @heavyarms2050 chat or the opponent?
[1:43:35] <cressedangel12> @ebay_toon where Tekken is Longhorn Steakhouse, Virtua Fighter is Texas de Brazil
[1:43:36] <cheetah1546> do you prefer a block button or holding back
[1:43:37] <%linne_inverse> akira is tetsuzanko, tetsuzanko is life
[1:43:43] <%ReKalibrate> oo nice punish
[1:43:47] <Aji__> I love the derpy ring outs in this haha
[1:43:47] <S_Factor_Sam> Akira's style is based on Bajiquan, not Karate.
[1:43:48] <%PFlare> Oof, bad match for Pat this time.
[1:43:49] <XJaegerZPrimeX> KomodoHype 🥣 NomNom TakeNRG
[1:43:49] <h0m3st4r> akira uses bājíquán, which emphasizes close range and explosive power
[1:43:50] <Wild_Samurai> Akira 1 frame online might as well be Guile throwing uncharged sonic boom
[1:43:52] <%Sulfur_Boride> Akira's fighting style is listed as the literal Japanese translation for Bajiquan, meaning "Eight Extremities Fist"
[1:43:58] <Nayafer91> nice round there max!
[1:43:59] <%Dwang> @BeatdownGG Oh for sure, they're two different entities, just that VF is more technical within its 3D space
[1:44:00] <@Sol_Install> pat has some delay that for sure
[1:44:00] <andviceversa_> Akira is Leo from Tekken
[1:44:02] <%torp101> character model is looking good
[1:44:04] <%heavyarms2050> @elementor374 the opponent
[1:44:05] <%Bholorak> retroEVIL
[1:44:05] <TheyCallMeVawn> Akira shoulders your fucking soul
[1:44:05] <TheHotBoi> I actually wanted to try Goh
[1:44:05] <Hericknhx> for people saying Akira does Judos, like have you guys never seen Judo monkaS , Judo is all about throws not strikes
[1:44:06] <+Ebay_Toon> lol gotcha chat thanks. yeah i dont play much fighting games just like watching them and the juggles reminded me of tekken
[1:44:07] <%boredomaf> We get it chat 😂😂😂😂
[1:44:10] <zetta_vs> Max's face LUL
[1:44:11] <SlenDragon> Kinda wish Wolf had the Vertebreaker as well. You know really cripple his opponents lol.
[1:44:11] <%Tom3daphil> akira uses bajiquan wich is a chinese style
[1:44:11] <+Rewrench> forget what it would be called but the shoulder charges are like defining of style
[1:44:12] <Kreiben46> Well if Kiryu cant be in a fighting game, how about the guy from Shenmue ????
[1:44:13] <%jonboy204> PUNCH HIM IN THE DICK
[1:44:15] <yobro_97> Akira is the first “Strand type” fighter
[1:44:16] <dominican87> @Maximilian_DOOD so im guessing theres no supers or ex moves in this game?
[1:44:16] <+jsthaguy> @starboi_hitya  sorry dood didn't mean to @ you
[1:44:16] <%bboyemusical> Akira uses Bajiquan not karate
[1:44:16] <+TungstenViper> it's Baji Quan, same style Ryo learns in Shenmue 2
[1:44:18] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @andviceversa_ Leo is Akira since he came 1st
[1:44:19] <pianorus> they fall like in slow motion xD
[1:44:22] <@shinkuhadoken1> loving this
[1:44:22] <+eskodas> That stage was awesome
[1:44:22] <Donsohl> beautiful match
[1:44:22] <+MidnightCrow> must be pats first fighting game Kappa
[1:44:22] <%DinoPulseZeta> You can tell Pat's been away from fighting games for a hot minute while his buddy MattMcMuscles manages to be more informed and such on fighting games when Max kicks his butt in a Virtual Fighter Match lol
[1:44:24] <Wartogh> sick music
[1:44:24] <+REVerend814> feels like pat is not knowing how to answer this pressure
[1:44:25] <%nenjutsutv> Akira's style is very offensive no?
[1:44:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yea you can see when Pat's got the mad delay
[1:44:29] <unkn39> sometimes I dont think its good to describe vf as some diffult game, just dont compare to those proplayer and play it for fun
[1:44:29] <+hellduderino> If you want to know more about Baji Quan look up the manga Kenji
[1:44:30] <@shinkuhadoken1> you guys are learning and it's so good to see
[1:44:31] <armorpanther2> After playing with akira doodInjury doodInjury doodInjury why god why.
[1:44:31] <+Bravetriforcer> why only one round?
[1:44:33] <+GearheadGoof> It is fascinating how grounded this game is
[1:44:34] <%PseuDEEnym> UFC Kappa
[1:44:35] <dgv88> @Dwang  if you think Tekken is easier you haven't played a good player that can move, you can't even hit him LUL
[1:44:36] <+fauxcarnage> How's the netcode? @Maximilian_DOOD
[1:44:40] <OptimusCack> max, do you know the jean side-turn unblockable?
[1:44:40] <%SharpsPanda> You mean like neck breaking? xD
[1:44:41] <@Viewtifulotaku7> ...
[1:44:41] <%Man_in_the_Red> i want to play a 70s Kung Fu flick
[1:44:41] <+Apex_Weeb> Does Jean use Muay Thai?
[1:44:42] <+TacoTangler> no supers, no specials, no gods no kings
[1:44:44] <+M08Xrd> Vanilla Fighters
[1:44:44] <+theogrearcade> real world juggles
[1:44:44] <%GDT1985> Is there a judoka in vf?
[1:44:45] <@Viewtifulotaku7> 12000
[1:44:46] <%heavyarms2050> and wears weird clothes
[1:44:46] <+K9Player> I prefer DoA over Virtua Fighter tho
[1:44:47] <slayerjr2> HeyGuys
[1:44:47] <Profmcstevie> You press normals and throws, and get in their head
[1:44:49] <%BeatdownGG> @Dwang Idk about that.  both are quite technical.  sure VF has the 1 frame stuff and tough inputs that you have to deal with, i'd say tekken is way more of a mindfuck with match up + opponent
[1:44:50] <%twowhisper22> it's called ufc 4
[1:44:50] <%JoshtheValiant> With juggle combos!  For better or worse ^_^;;
[1:44:50] <%Lcknes> Fight Night
[1:44:51] <elementor374> @kreiben46 They have to get Yu Suzuki for that and well.... he doesn't work for sega anymore lol
[1:44:51] <%PFlare> Except for Dural.
[1:44:52] <@Viewtifulotaku7> We are up to 12k in that question.
[1:44:53] <+L3m0nTwi5t> With moon jumps
[1:44:54] <black_mishima> tekken has that too
[1:44:56] <%Man_in_the_Red> Invincible Armor videogame when
[1:44:56] <+krazy_swayze> Ryo Hazuki is like an odd combo of Akira, Kage, and Jacky imo.
[1:44:57] <@Viewtifulotaku7> !vf5
[1:44:57] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[1:44:57] <+starboi_hitya> @jsthaguy <3
[1:44:58] <nelsondajinx> i need advice for using jean what buttons are good for staggers can anyone help?
[1:44:59] <$tloa> @Apex_Weeb Jean is karate
[1:44:59] <%SquallAdv> yup
[1:45:00] <synthetic099> cept for Kage's 10 foot toss
[1:45:02] <$shwez> i waiting for Pencak Silat character Kappa
[1:45:04] <h0m3st4r> @nenjutsutv correct. he's all about getting in close and pulverizing opponents with elbow, knee, and shoulder strikes
[1:45:05] <andviceversa_> @viewtifulotaku7 that's not what i meant and you effing know it
[1:45:09] <MrBuncakes> @apex_weeb Jean uses karate
[1:45:10] <%Monkiebrainz> yet surprisingly no Capoeira character. @Maximilian_DOOD
[1:45:10] <lordlord07> @Viewtifulotaku7 breathe count to four, exhale, count to four
[1:45:10] <zetta_vs> @GDT1985 Goh
[1:45:12] <TheyCallMeVawn> Jean is shotokan karate @Apex_Weeb
[1:45:12] <hobotech64> daytona car uses car-fu
[1:45:13] <Kreiben46> No kings, No gods, ONLY MEN!
[1:45:13] <+TaNooki_kun> @gdt1985 That’s Goh
[1:45:13] <+dasmesee> We need Capoeira
[1:45:13] <GeltonZ> @Apex_Weeb Nope, Karate. Brad uses muay thai, stole it from Vanessa and I'm still salty
[1:45:13] <XJaegerZPrimeX> ShowOfHands ShowOfHands ShowOfHands ShowOfHands MaxLOL
[1:45:14] <Brindle_Stryker> so i can dive bomb with my head :p
[1:45:15] <%VZLABoi> @GDT1985  Goh
[1:45:18] <+jsthaguy> @sol_install  you thing you could ask Max to more the UI over the game timer thanks
[1:45:18] <jigglerjoggler> Plus frames are a suggestion
[1:45:18] <%kojack_ay> Just play Ufc if you want that
[1:45:19] <%excannondrill> And then you have Dural Kappa
[1:45:20] <zzz_nuke> no ex, no supers, no meters whatsoever... JUST STRAIGHT HANDS!!!!
[1:45:21] <ChuySeeker> Tekken has bears and devils
[1:45:24] <@ChrisRG21> whens sonic from sonic the fighters in VF Kappa
[1:45:25] <%raikagelord1> I want a Kengan Ahsura fighting game so bad.
[1:45:27] <%Cgame_me811> That’s one of the reasons I love this franchise Kreygasm
[1:45:28] <+REVerend814> the delay pump kick is so damn sick looking
[1:45:30] <+hellduderino> Kenji is the best manga if you want to learn about chinese martial arts
[1:45:31] <%nenjutsutv> @h0m3st4r No idea How some people thought that was Karate LUL
[1:45:33] <%PFlare> @shwez I mean you joke, but Pencak Silat is basically a rougher Muay Thai.
[1:45:33] <clefairytownz> RKO D:
[1:45:34] <+Linoir> @dgv88 I know what you mean... but Tekken really is easier, Mechanics wise tekken is far more forgiving than VF.
[1:45:35] <jukebox2014> yeah
[1:45:40] <+sol_badguy27> @Apex_Weeb The closest to Muay Thai is Brad, who uses Kickboxing.
[1:45:40] <@Sol_Install> Max isn't really covering where he is tho
[1:45:41] <%HeyTrey_LIVE> Max's face hahaha
[1:45:42] <+Apex_Weeb> oh okay thanks guys
[1:45:43] <kefka_himself> @armorpanther2  yeah man today i discovered i got artritis on my hands
[1:45:43] <%Monkiebrainz> @GeltonZ actually he just uses kick boxing.
[1:45:44] <%zane_dye> jean is kyokushin

[1:45:44] <FunnyCrimes> @raikagelord1 we gotta get that Baki fighter first
[1:45:45] <+mrkungfugrip> i remember the drunken fist character from this game being so fun
[1:45:46] <+kellz143> Does Wolf hit people with chairs and through tables? LUL LUL
[1:45:46] <A_Pretty_Radguy> Ah, yes, Profession Wrestling is my favorite real world martial art.
[1:45:48] <%Brunty023> @zzz_nuke Some raw azz fighting! It's great!
[1:45:49] <Wartogh> @GDT1985 GOH is a judoca
[1:45:49] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @andviceversa_ Not really. I see that all the tie since people have no idea what VF is.
[1:45:50] <+tabenterenter> Your plus frames must beat pat’s stand
[1:45:54] <%GDT1985> I never played a VF with Goh I don't think.
[1:45:54] <@Viewtifulotaku7> time*
[1:45:55] <+kuraisenshi69> Hi Max, how excited are you for Intergrade?!
[1:45:58] <elementor374> @shwez Ah, fellow indonesian i see. Apa kabarmu
[1:46:01] <%RustyCoyoteA> good ole LA Punish... never lets us down LUL
[1:46:03] <%abztrakt95> lul professional wrestling = martial arts
[1:46:05] <L_Y3T> It's not hard to see why Tekken came out on top
[1:46:07] <%raikagelord1> @funnycrimes fair
[1:46:08] <psycoms> i think the juggles only hold it back from being more real. tho i love juggles so id be sad if they were gone lol

[1:46:10] <Kobukson> no jean is not shotokan, shotokan stylists stance are sideways, jean is a kyokushin karate user, knockdown karate with a front stance
[1:46:12] <@ChrisRG21> wrestling IS a martial arts
[1:46:13] <%PFlare> @A_Pretty_Radguy I mean, it's a thing you can go out and learn.
[1:46:13] <+Rolandknight> seem Pat is getting tired.
[1:46:14] <GeltonZ> @Monkiebrainz Ah! My bad!
[1:46:14] <+starboi_hitya> VR is about Dong
[1:46:20] <%Lcknes> DDT !!!!!!!!!
[1:46:20] <+ryanaleonarddesigns> So can we get Kazuma Kiryu and Ryo Hazuki as guests DLC's?
[1:46:25] <h0m3st4r> @A_Pretty_Radguy professional wrestlers making it big in mma aren't unheard of. remember brock lesnar?
[1:46:25] <$DoggoConcern> Neckbreaker outta nowhere
[1:46:27] <%BeatdownGG> @abztrakt95 Tell that to a Strong Style wrestler and they will kick your ass
[1:46:29] <%PFlare> Hell, an ACTUAL pro wrestler did mocap for this game.
[1:46:33] <%EmperorPylades> @abztrakt95 Might not be martial arts but its still as cool as shit
[1:46:35] <%Monkiebrainz> @GeltonZ No Prob
[1:46:41] <$shwez> @elementor374 :P Malaysian, i should've said Silat Gayung but... baik sahaja :D
[1:46:43] <%SnipingMonkey> wtf was that move
[1:46:43] <%PFlare> @ryanaleonarddesigns Kiryu will never ever be in a fighting game.
[1:46:44] <%kungfupinoy> @abztrakt95 wrestling really is a martial art.
[1:46:44] <%nenjutsutv> @ryanaleonarddesigns Not in this game. VF6 is that will be a thing
[1:46:47] <%Weevensteven> damn
[1:46:49] <black_mishima> finisher from sean is sick
[1:46:50] <D3rrtyD4n> LETS GO PAT
[1:46:51] <%Brunty023> @ryanaleonarddesigns Kiryu, no! Ryo, surprised he hasn't had a fighting game appearance yet
[1:46:51] <%SnipingMonkey> HE SNAPPED HIS ANKLE monkaS
[1:46:51] <%PseuDEEnym> every fighting game has a combo system. so whats wrong with juggles being a combo system?
[1:46:55] <%SnipingMonkey> BAH GAWD
[1:46:56] <tacticalnuke002> People, people, Brad is Muay Thai but is identified as kickboxing in the game due to being admitted into the VF Tournament due to kickboxing success. We've been over this.
[1:46:56] <%Weevensteven> ground grabs op
[1:46:59] <%ReKalibrate> oh shit good shit pat
[1:47:00] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Chat: Director for Yakuza has said Kiryu can't be in a fighting game because he doesn't hit females. Not happening.
[1:47:01] <BreadMakerCTM> god, these animations are *chefs kiss*
[1:47:02] <StormtrooperdeAimbot> good round
[1:47:02] <+TaNooki_kun> @gdt1985 Goh is pretty much a thug that practices Judo
[1:47:03] <Wartogh> @L_Y3T yeah it's because it copied everything good VF did and make it flashier and more easy to play
[1:47:03] <%Cgame_me811> @nenjutsutv Do people think that because of his Default outfit?
[1:47:07] <%Akizea> apparently WWEAsuka did the mocap for VAnessa so thats super tight
[1:47:07] <%GDT1985> Ankle lock.
[1:47:07] <+8bit_amethyst> Solar plexus is gone
[1:47:08] <%PFlare> @ryanaleonarddesigns The studio/Yakuza team head has stated he will never ever ever hit a girl.
[1:47:09] <SavinTheYakuza> @ryanaleonarddesigns seconded I’ll take any Yakuza character that isn’t from 7
[1:47:10] <+ProfessorPuzzle> nliKurt
[1:47:11] <%Monkiebrainz> without the show biz side of wrestling it is an actual martial art.
[1:47:14] <andviceversa_> @viewtifulotaku7 then let me explain. it's easier to say that Akira and Leo has same style instead just saying "akira is bajiquan" and people would "wtf is bajiquan"
[1:47:15] <%BeatdownGG> @PseuDEEnym nothing, let the plebs remain plebs.  its basically biased bait
[1:47:17] <Eddalot> @Maximilian_DOOD So is VF a slower and more realistic Tekken?
[1:47:18] <+Apex_Weeb> is this playstation only?
[1:47:20] <+sinrin> combos look way harder than in tekken
[1:47:23] <%Zakk219> I mean, wrestling can incorporate martial arts in the same way as traditional grappling and other striking styles
[1:47:23] <Riinegan> @Maximilian_DOOD are you enjoying jean's mechanic of delaying hits?
[1:47:24] <TheyCallMeVawn> Brad still uses a lot of kick boxing, he just incorporates muay thai
[1:47:25] <h0m3st4r> @kungfupinoy that's true. it's usually not as stylized as pro wrestling circuits would have you believe, though
[1:47:30] <hujkull> -15
[1:47:34] <%SnipingMonkey> Eddalot no i dont think so
[1:47:34] <$SentientAppleSauce> NECK ATTACK!
[1:47:35] <Kreiben46> @apex_weeb yes
[1:47:37] <lordlord07> how the F did we stumble into the same martial art discussion as last night LUL
[1:47:38] <OptimusCack> the shoulder tackle is at least -12 on block
[1:47:39] <+sol_badguy27> Virtua Fighter can get EXTREMELY fast.
[1:47:45] <%MannyExo> Brad Burns is so much fun to play
[1:47:46] <elementor374> @shwez Oh lol, dari Malaysia yah? nice
[1:47:47] <%BeatdownGG> @Eddalot No.  As someone who plays Tekken I wouldn't even compare them
[1:47:49] <+mrkungfugrip> Wolf should have a stance for "taking Bumps" where moves do less damage but he cant really attack lol
[1:47:52] <%Augentavis_Kay> LUL
[1:47:55] <fIashman92> Shoulder Tackle is -15
[1:47:55] <Metalgaiden96 > No matter what the director said. People are still going to want Kiryu regardless.
[1:47:56] <iheartmota> hes extremely offensive and punishes turtles
[1:47:59] <%Dwang> Why think of Kiryu entering a fighter when you could think of Majima? Food for thought HahaThink
[1:48:00] <XJaegerZPrimeX> B r u h XD
[1:48:02] <%JIVEB0T> @Akizea She confirmed it on twitter a few years ago
[1:48:04] <Wolfie_Shoujo> THE SONG DUDE SourPls
[1:48:08] <%MannyExo> He reminds me a lot of Bruce from Tekken 2.
[1:48:09] <MimicTheDragon> SourPls
[1:48:09] <+TacoTangler> oh no the wall grinder corridor
[1:48:10] <%BeatdownGG> @Eddalot It would be a disservice to both games
[1:48:12] <heero719> cool
[1:48:13] <tacticalnuke002> @theycallmevawn Other way round. He uses Muay Thai but incorporates kickboxing
[1:48:14] <%SleepyNingyo> best stage music
[1:48:15] <%Kalzassa> @lordlord07 cause chat is chat happythoSilly
[1:48:20] <+Apex_Weeb> @Kreiben46 balls alright thank you!
[1:48:23] <GTelias2212> that is a really short arena
[1:48:26] <%Cgame_me811> Why are you pointing doodStare
[1:48:31] <%GDT1985> What does Jean do that sets him apart? Seems like basic strikes to me.
[1:48:31] <SavinTheYakuza> @metalgaiden96 facts
[1:48:34] <%nenjutsutv> @pflare I wouldn't say Kiryu would "Never" be in a FG....Nagoshi said he's "Hesitant" which means with some convincing, he might be open to the idea
[1:48:35] <TheyCallMeVawn> They should honestly just make VF characters bosses in some VR minigame in Lost Judgment
[1:48:37] <%B_rad1157> it seems like every character I've tried in this feels fun doodGood
[1:48:37] <Jag3rKhan> There is a joystick appearing sometimes, does it mean a stun ?
[1:48:43] <+sinrin> hug
[1:48:43] <Nayafer91> you can throw punish for sure all throw are 10 frames.
[1:48:52] <+Linoir> Virtua FIghter is more realistic than Tekken, yes, but not slower really. How fast VF gets is mostly character based.
[1:48:56] <+theoryspark> @GDT1985 guard breaks like fahkumram
[1:49:02] <%BeatdownGG> This game has more in common with DOA with the grav physics and how DOA pretty much jacked move sets LUL
[1:49:05] <deathtrap5000> @maximilian_dood what about jeans guard break rave
[1:49:06] <XJaegerZPrimeX> KomodoHype PopCorn SabaPing
[1:49:08] <r_altali> God this stage's theme is so fucking good
[1:49:10] <%MightySandwich> Yeah, you can shake out
[1:49:13] <%acecondeuce> Man, this game looks so sick in motion
[1:49:13] <%coingray> @GDT1985 He can delay his strikes to charge them up by holding the attack button.
[1:49:14] <+Siosefa> Kiryu can still be in Tekken if you block the female char from fighting you when he's selected m0xyG
[1:49:14] <%torp101> is this game one of the more technical type of  fighting games chat?
[1:49:14] <$CladedArmor> more like a stagger state
[1:49:16] <+ryanaleonarddesigns> Okay fine. SONIC as DLC! 🤣
[1:49:19] <%BeatdownGG> @Jag3rKhan means wiggle the stick and get up faster
[1:49:20] <%PFlare> @nenjutsutv I strongly doubt it's happening. Even in Yakuza LAD, Kiryu won't ever intentionally target any women in your party when you fight him.
[1:49:20] <%Man_in_the_Red> @beatdowngg and characters
[1:49:23] <@PatStaresAt> @Maximilian_DOOD alright I got one more in me lol, I gotta get some sleep
[1:49:26] <Wartogh> @Maximilian_DOOD you gotta master that Jean's DEADLY RAVE for these kids finding it slower than Tekken man
[1:49:26] <%wood8890> @jag3rkhan Yes
[1:49:28] <%MannyExo> VF and DOA are the similar imo.
[1:49:36] <antithes3> @r_altali fr
[1:49:37] <+guitarcorp> @BeatdownGG well DOA is pretty much based on VF
[1:49:38] <%nintega010> pkkpk @maximilian_dood
[1:49:38] <%Brunty023> Chat, there are other great picks from Yakuza that could be in a fighting game besides Kiryu. Like Yagami and Akiyama, for example
[1:49:40] <arccun> man that stage just isn't that good for wolf i feel lmao
[1:49:40] <OptimusCack> the shoulder tackle-15, i double checked. the other folks were correct
[1:49:41] <Unknownkidx> What was is Jean's "Flash Kick"?
[1:49:42] <+sol_badguy27> @GDT1985 He also has chargeable moves that make him plus or are outright unblockable.
[1:49:44] <%GooeyLagoon> Everyone's asking for Kiryu or Majima, but I don't see anyone asking for Ichiban. moopokeThink
[1:49:45] <jpkun9902> Command Training is in session?

[1:49:52] <Jag3rKhan> Ok thanks @BeatdownGG @wood8890

[1:49:58] <+pupil31> The Tekken Community LUL
[1:49:58] <elementor374> BASS SLAP 2020Shred
[1:49:59] <%Darnell16player> Brad in this is kickboxing style right?
[1:50:00] <last__coralian> Was about to ask "what's a deadly rave?" but then I remembered fighting game glossary =3
[1:50:01] <+HeavyBogard> Max, dress your Jean. Make him a fashionable man!
[1:50:01] <%SpookySenpai20XX> This game gets NUTS
[1:50:02] <CalderGaming> or in pat's case day ??? plus years of rust
[1:50:04] <Synchroscheme> what, what blind person said that?
[1:50:05] <@Leon_Tekashi> Not everyone is a pro day 1 chat
[1:50:05] <%kyosukeneo89> Kiryu refuse r
[1:50:06] <holychan> what do you mean this isn't the peak?  LUL
[1:50:08] <frosty_frozon> @gooeylagoon exactly
[1:50:09] <%FatAlfonso> can we get a Virtua Racing car as a DLC fighter?
[1:50:09] <+M08Xrd> Pat hasn't palyed in years i think
[1:50:09] <%Onyx_13k> Tekken is slow compared to this game actually
[1:50:10] <%sae_what> You may not like it, but this is what Peak VF looks like Kappa
[1:50:11] <%Deezskee> doodLUL
[1:50:13] <big_aristotle> High level Tekken usually slows down because its so defensive
[1:50:13] <+Linoir> also Tekken is actually a pretty bad comparison to Virtua Fighter in general. DOA is closer, not even joking.
[1:50:13] <Andrako> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:50:14] <%PseuDEEnym> what much are the hit points in this game?
[1:50:15] <%MannyExo> Side stepping combos are insane in this game
[1:50:15] <%Cgame_me811> @beatdowngg Yeah the Director said he got inspired by virtual fighter to make DOA
[1:50:18] <+dasmesee> High level VF is awsome to watch
[1:50:18] <%Bedskirts> I still have yet to beat anybody online, but I did get two rounds off an Akira so that was cool. My fundamentals are so wack
[1:50:19] <%saltmachineto> @GDT1985 He can charge certain moves for plus frames and cancel them mid-charge for extra stuff. Also, he poses a lot.
[1:50:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Ichiban >>> Majima >>>> Kiryu, fight me
[1:50:21] <%PseuDEEnym> *how
[1:50:22] <%SpookySenpai20XX> Lion and Shun Di are NUTS
[1:50:23] <@Viewtifulotaku7> I feel like chat is on a time loop and forgets everything that happened the previous day.
[1:50:25] <@shinkuhadoken1> @MannyExo it's so fun to sidestep!!!
[1:50:25] <kaboodlesque> tekken fans at it again huh
[1:50:26] <+zzer0zz1> Tekken players played this growing up
[1:50:31] <rance_zero> kasumi as DLC
[1:50:33] <Stoggaz> I love the compression for the voice lines
[1:50:35] <%Brogox> This is fast but moving quickly is not easy.
[1:50:39] <%NostromoStasis> SourPls
[1:50:40] <%Man_in_the_Red> @gooeylagoon not many people played like a Dragon and dont assosiate Ichiban with fighters because, you know, RPG character
[1:50:40] <%nenjutsutv> @pflare I mean thats fine. Im just saying the way Nagoshi said it, means he can be convinced.
[1:50:41] <%Brunty023> @GooeyLagoon Thing is though, with Ichiban (and I'd love him in a fighting game too), we haven't seen much of how he fights WITHOUT the bat
[1:50:44] <+mrkungfugrip> i dont know if they have the snow and beach levels where the sand and snow piles moved and deformed with the characters falling and moving, but it was so cool
[1:50:48] <Chinzasteve> @Viewtifulotaku7 they just don't listen, that's all lmao.
[1:50:48] <mopeycat> Why hit a downed man in the ass?
[1:50:48] <GeltonZ> DOA was literally built off the VF2 engine so it is indeed a better comparison.
[1:50:50] <%BeatdownGG> @zzer0zz1 ...or they played Tekken LUL
[1:50:53] <%botankazama> @zzer0zz1 yep
[1:50:56] <Eddalot> Jesus you ask one thing and i get branded an idiot for not being familiar with VF?
[1:50:57] <%MannyExo> @shinkuhadoken1 wure beats jumping around. haha
[1:50:57] <%Bedskirts> @Viewtifulotaku7 somehow totally new people arrive every day? I don't know what happens
[1:50:58] <%Dwang> @Viewtifulotaku7 I'm still thinking this is pre-release and the game comes out tomorrow LUL
[1:50:58] <thetak0boy> doodGood doodGood doodGood
[1:50:59] <+johnnyearthquake> this song rocks
[1:51:00] <queencharlene> @mrkungfugrip they do
[1:51:01] <%MannyExo> sure*
[1:51:01] <GTelias2212> is not that VF is slower than Tekken i know is not everyone is lying but i can say it feels. . .floaty but that's because of the physics VF is mostly a Fighting Simulator
[1:51:02] <mighty_havoc> I almost thought that was ken lol
[1:51:03] <%Man_in_the_Red> that said i'd play the shit outta Ichiban and he gets strikers
[1:51:03] <%deividesu> Kappa500 I'm here now
[1:51:09] <Bladebrent> Hallo Chit! I have a VF question if anyone can answer it: How do you get past people spamming low punch/jab?
[1:51:11] <jpkun9902> VF is 5he OG 3D fighter
[1:51:11] <unkn39> if they add fighting vipers and last bronx chracters in, it could be more chaos than tekken 7
[1:51:11] <SirCheeseburgur> crazy how some of these voice clips are 25 years old
[1:51:14] <+ryanaleonarddesigns> Fighting Vipers Characters maybe??? 🤔🤔🤔
[1:51:16] <h0m3st4r> you guys think the tekken fandom is toxic? you should see the rwby fandom
[1:51:18] <Q_Ebansu> This isnt even VF's final form
[1:51:20] <%Resident_Stevil> @Viewtifulotaku7 Oh hi there I don't believe we've met, I'm Resident Stevil Kappa

[2:01:27] <Eddalot> @Maximilian_DOOD It was wrong of me to think people had a 10 year game figured out on day 1.
[2:01:27] <+SolidSnake1231> so basically what MK 11 is missing?
[2:01:27] <zenith0111> So this is a honest fighting game?
[2:01:28] <%inajefflymanner> is it the most balanced fighting game?
[2:01:29] <fancy_clown89> Well said Max.
[2:01:29] <Aji__> I just wish this came out like a month or two ago, not 10 days away from GG :(

[2:03:38] <%YellowYoshi1> Man this is heartbreaking to watch while I struggle to move or consistently do double diagonal inputs.
[2:03:38] <%ShellshockPrime> I think Virtua Fighter 4 made it to PS2 before Tekken 4 did. Same year, though.
[2:03:39] <%ryujithecoolslayer> @KatsuArt it will come soon
[2:03:39] <%angeluriel1530> no that was 4

[2:03:51] <AfternoonConcession> for some reason this 3d fighting game has mechanics that i like the most, idk why but tekken and DOA just don't do it for me
[2:03:54] <+DjLeeAtlas> Hopefully there will be a Beat Tribe Cup next year
[2:03:54] <%noorami> that was aggresive
[2:03:56] <+Hareil0079> VF3 Final tuned

[2:04:31] <foxlyfe> @Dwang free!?!?! awesome, thanks!
[2:04:35] <+RowenCleric> I hate these costumes so much
[2:04:35] <+Angry_Ed> @tacticalnuke002 I mean, Dural is technically the most unrealistic
[2:04:36] <%Dwang> My main used to be Kage because og how cool he looks
[2:04:37] <%Man_in_the_Red> @tacticalnuke002 idk, he's pretty decent as a ninja, he's wearing blue like he should Kappa
[2:04:37] <SuddenDeath> VF3 had wall combos...theres a combo in the intro with taka
[2:04:39] <%PseuDEEnym> so is Lei Fei wack in this game?
[2:04:40] <%JJLexcaliber> Throws are duckable, but that leaves you open to mids, just like Tekken.
[2:04:42] <%Slime_Roy> @retrozaid niceeeeee doodOK doodOK
[2:04:43] <MomolueD> gotta remake all the assets
[2:04:46] <%Makriev> @Maximilian_DOOD How many characters are in VF now? Is there more to be added?
[2:04:46] <Bladebrent> One thing I appreciate?  They still name the characters unlike in tekken where its just the character portraits in the corner.  I cant tell what any character is if they have all these cosmetics
[2:04:47] <%Jflaskd13> I like customs but sometimes they are major distractions
[2:04:48] <wiqidbritt> Was VF3 the one with uneven stage floors?
[2:04:49] <%ryujithecoolslayer> this so crazy man
[2:04:51] <%inajefflymanner> this movement looks so much better than the jittery shuffles in tekken
[2:04:54] <%Otoshi_Gami> @Maximilian_DOOD this guy LUL
[2:04:55] <%marc_x_ruckus> is this the 2008 version?
[2:04:55] <fgc_splash> AKIRA DOES SO MUCH DAMAGE NotLikeThis
[2:04:58] <deviljhojho_> god akira players are so cool
[2:04:58] <OptimusCack> technically with lazy throw escape you have a 1-in-3 chance of breaking throws
[2:05:00] <abelharker> LUL LUL LUL
[2:05:03] <%zefitz> Why did Tekken take off and not VF?
[2:05:03] <EmperorVon> UnSane UnSane
[2:05:03] <%Slime_Roy> @ryujithecoolslayer friendooooi doodYelp doodBro doodBro doodSurvive doodSurvive
[2:05:07] <%Tricky_vfdc> omg these K~G cancels are stylish
[2:05:07] <%Dwang> @foxlyfe Free if you own PS Plus, mind you! Just grab it from the PS Plus Games section
[2:05:09] <jukebox2014> uh oh
[2:05:13] <mikedot> Wow, high level VF5 is legit
[2:05:14] <+guitarcorp> god that hard akira combo
[2:05:15] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood i was doing the tutorial and the game tells you to hold PG and a direction to help break throws
[2:05:17] <kheyki> Crazy
[2:05:18] <%The_Vengeful> Lei Fei is so hype
[2:05:19] <+dasmesee> This is incredibly impressive
[2:05:20] <XxKshawnxX> Akira pressure
[2:05:20] <georgebecker> Akira is deadly in the right hands
[2:05:22] <%Zaku7777zaku> @maximilian_dood Did you see that SNK has delayed KOFXV? It's now being delayed till Q1 2022.
[2:05:23] <+Nocturne_Noble> SOny backed it.

[2:05:26] <tarek_el_pimente> how are throws broken in VF chat?
[2:05:28] <%BlackMage66652> Tekken has demons
[2:05:30] <@Leon_Tekashi> RIP Dreamcast
[2:05:30] <%ryujithecoolslayer> @Slime_Roy BRO! doodCrazy doodBro doodScrub
[2:05:33] <44Rampage> NotLikeThis True
[2:05:36] <%Otoshi_Gami> @Maximilian_DOOD yep
[2:05:36] <%GDT1985> Playstation.
[2:05:39] <RagnaXBL> also we can play tekken in africa...
[2:05:41] <%twowhisper22> rip
[2:05:42] <dgv88> Tekken 3 was one of the best selling PS1 games of all time
[2:05:43] <Wartogh> when akira puts you in all 4 it's all over
[2:05:44] <SalvadorZombie> YUUUUUUUUP
[2:05:44] <+thefishofwar> King is cool is the reason xyrosDurp
[2:05:46] <%Tricky_vfdc> wow
[2:05:46] <%Dwang> @tarekelasspadre opposing direction and P+G
[2:05:47] <+CHEETO_TAXES> Tekken had more characters and eventually was better graphic wise
[2:05:48] <%ryujithecoolslayer> yup its really true
[2:05:49] <AfternoonConcession> it's a 3 way guess for grabs but on CSB they said VF4 had 8 way grab breaks @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:05:49] <h0m3st4r> so, console wars, then?
[2:05:53] <%Otoshi_Gami> Over shadowed the sega console
[2:05:55] <Jag3rKhan> D: Basically, if you take a combo/series of hit, you're done !
[2:05:55] <%Cgame_me811> Yeah pretty much doodSad doodSad doodSad doodSad doodSad
[2:05:56] <heat_obrien> that Lei is insane
[2:05:59] <rance_zero> tekken won because playstation won
[2:06:00] <%OgGeek2016> Tekken 3 was SOOOOO good as well
[2:06:01] <kobura57> also SEGA was so bad at marketing in the past
[2:06:03] <%HawkGoggles2> True I had a playstation. Kappa
[2:06:03] <roxzor_0> And... It was the Saturn, great console, horrible marketing
[2:06:06] <EmperorVon> not sonic adventure??? hmmm
[2:06:10] <%Murgurth> Then as a result Tekken just became popular. Makes sense.
[2:06:11] <%soulburnswhenipee> It's because Tekken had a boxing kangaroo/dinosaur
[2:06:12] <SlenDragon> I loved the Dreamcast
[2:06:19] <kheyki> the first console war?
[2:06:21] <andviceversa_> Casualties of war
[2:06:21] <+zzer0zz1> my first vf was vf4
[2:06:24] <%Brogox> Sega consoles felt rare here in 90s.
[2:06:26] <%TheKryptonian49> damn
[2:06:27] <%Deezyfesheezy> Sega is run by chimps, Bamco is run by greedy corporate heads so they make sure to push tekken
[2:06:28] <DauragonLebrart> Good evening Max and Doods! How’s everyone doing tonight? @maximilian_dood @chat
[2:06:29] <GTelias2212> F*** the Saturn
[2:06:29] <%beachhaust> tekken 3 goat indeed
[2:06:30] <XxKshawnxX> i feel lei-fei and akira are like the hardest doods to learn
[2:06:30] <+thatdemoguy> VF4 was also budget priced to move
[2:06:34] <%inajefflymanner> VF4 on PS2 was my first fighting game ever :)
[2:06:34] <%ryujithecoolslayer> @roxzor_0 how bad was the marking?
[2:06:35] <+8bit_amethyst> Videogame history with Max
[2:06:35] <%RustyCoyoteA> VF4 sold the best too, right?
[2:06:35] <Sebastian19321> EVEN SAKURAI SAID THAT
[2:06:36] <%HumanoidV13> Yup that's the one that got me into it
[2:06:36] <%VashDaDamWeed> Did tekken 3 started side step first
[2:06:36] <tarek_el_pimente> @Dwang thx
[2:06:37] <+Hulkette510> Did anyone play Bloody Roar? Thoughts on that fighting game? I used to love it
[2:06:38] <+mrkungfugrip> does this got a fake "arcade" single player mode that unlocks parts? That's how i remembered VF4 working
[2:06:39] <+Nocturne_Noble> Because Dreamcast was dead by then.
[2:06:39] <Aejis> Sand physics Kreygasm
[2:06:39] <mrscoo> I still bust out VF4 EVO like once a month
[2:06:40] <jigglerjoggler> my first vf was 4 too
[2:06:40] <+Siosefa> @soulburnswhenipee I'd believe that for it being popular LUL
[2:06:40] <%Thejuanandonly559> The power of PlayStation doodLeon doodLeon
[2:06:42] <%BBboy20> i do remember the VF4 commercials
[2:06:42] <FiberWon> *Soul Blade Kappa
[2:06:42] <%umbravi> Tekken also has better character designs.
[2:06:43] <%twowhisper22> tekken 3 doodMash
[2:06:44] <%KaynanLA> @GTelias2212 D:
[2:06:44] <kizknife> Costumes are way better in this version
[2:06:44] <%BeatdownGG> @Kheydash first console war was Nintendo and Sega
[2:06:47] <%Otoshi_Gami> Best REVIEWS hype :p
[2:06:48] <%Cgame_me811> VF 4 Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:06:49] <%Kyle_Steen> RIP the Dream... Cast
[2:06:49] <+nancybotwin425> it came out very close to the same time as Tekken 4 as well
[2:06:49] <%Finch_9001> Finch_9001 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[2:06:52] <$Darshiro> VF4 Evo is one of the best home fighters ever.
[2:06:53] <Comb711> Virtua Fighter 5 was the first game I saw get a 5/5 on Xplay
[2:06:54] <%ShellshockPrime> Tekken 4 was disappointing, but Virtua Fighter 4 was really good.
[2:06:54] <hobotech64> doa2
[2:06:54] <+Owltosser> I bought VF4 Evo on a whim, originally I was looking to get Tekken 5 but saw VF on sale
[2:06:55] <arccun> i think another thing is just tekken has had more support the past decade, what with tekken tag 2 and tekken 7 still getting support
[2:06:58] <%OlivePowerRanger> my first VF was VF4evo
[2:07:00] <@NicoB7700> VF4 Evo was 20 bucks, for hundreds of hours of content @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:07:02] <Auriculum> Yep, I remember SC2 was getting compared to VF4 Evo all the time
[2:07:02] <%zane_dye> vf4 was dank expensive at the time
[2:07:02] <davey0000> Didn't VF4 have like the nuttiest training mode ever? Like optimal full combos for Counter Hits for every Counter?
[2:07:03] <%crapplesmane> crapplesmane subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 67 months! 
[2:07:03] <Wartogh> all time Kreygasm
[2:07:03] <%xIDJKingIx> The good ol' Sega $20 deals
[2:07:03] <%mayo_on_rice> @Maximilian_DOOD how did VF fare internationally?
[2:07:03] <%Man_in_the_Red> @mrkungfugrip quest mode isnt in 5
[2:07:04] <%KaynanLA> EVO Kreygasm
[2:07:05] <%Darnell16player> VF4 on ps2 I still have
[2:07:06] <jukebox2014> sega console never popular in my country except sega games
[2:07:06] <fgc_splash> AUSTRALIA IS SO FAR, CAN U PLAY FIGHTING GAMES THERE? claraaShrug
[2:07:06] <%ReKalibrate> when VF4 came out everyone I knew played. It was crazy how many people I met who played it
[2:07:07] <+KingZai> Vf4 has like a 94 on metacritic, thats crazy for a fighting game
[2:07:07] <AfternoonConcession> what single player content did it have? @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:07:08] <%BlackMage66652> Sega Saturn killed my family
[2:07:10] <%ryujithecoolslayer> aw thats nice
[2:07:16] <%JIVEB0T> @kizknife They are more likely coming out the ps4 version
[2:07:16] <dako_briggs> I stopped playing fighting games for some reason, got burnt out from all the tekkens
[2:07:17] <%Dwang> @Deezyfesheezy SEGA's in their redemption arc now, they're slowly getting back up there with global PSO2 NGS, now this
[2:07:18] <%BBboy20> Oh, that VF4 shirt?
[2:07:20] <%Otoshi_Gami> @Maximilian_DOOD Nice :)
[2:07:21] <GeltonZ> @Hulkette510 I love Bloody Roar. The FGC used to hate it but now people are slowly realizing how great it is.
[2:07:23] <+funnyginsan> Soul caliber 2 and virtua fighter 4 good times
[2:07:23] <%ryokupo> Quest Mode Kreygasm
[2:07:23] <%barkon345> I still stand by that. VF4 had the best single player content ever in a fighting game
[2:07:24] <TheyCallMeVawn> QUEST MODE
[2:07:24] <Sonexay> I played the crap out of kumite on vf4
[2:07:26] <wiqidbritt> VF4 had the mode where you played in different Japanese arcades
[2:07:28] <DANfan69> Not to mention that VF5 arcade was rarely seen in American arcades, which is why there was no VF scene in America for years
[2:07:30] <+guitarcorp> i hope they bring back quest mode
[2:07:30] <%BBboy20> That simmons been wearing?
[2:07:31] <%Otoshi_Gami> SHIT TON content hype :)
[2:07:31] <%jonboy204> @Maximilian_DOOD WAS VF EVO A PS GREATEST HITS AT LAUNCH?
[2:07:32] <deathtrap5000> These costumes make it so hard to tell what character is being used LUL
[2:07:32] <%kungfujesus1> What store did you work at?!
[2:07:33] <@NicoB7700> I miss Quest Mode
[2:07:33] <%thatCRAZYrooster> damn that combo
[2:07:33] <%wizchiefa23> larxaLurk
[2:07:34] <+Bariman98> bruh
[2:07:35] <%TokenBlackDood> Whats quest mode?
[2:07:35] <DreamBoss__> vf EVO is amazing
[2:07:35] <+thatdemoguy> the game literally taught you how to play
[2:07:35] <%buddha_is_five_six> Will you be streaming New Genesis on release Max?
[2:07:37] <%xIDJKingIx> All the ESPN 2K5 games sold at $20 as well.
[2:07:37] <%KaynanLA> BURADULEE
[2:07:38] <%BrokemanJ> I miss quest mode.
[2:07:38] <kobura57> Also SEGA marketing was so bad in the past
[2:07:39] <+mrkungfugrip> VF4 had Goh added to it.  I think i still have a copy of VF4 ps2 in my room
[2:07:39] <natsufuji_> quest mode was insane
[2:07:40] <XJaegerZPrimeX> 2020Surprise 2020Surprise 2020Surprise
[2:07:41] <@KAINONAUT> I’ve never played a VF and have no idea where to start LUL
[2:07:41] <%beachhaust> this commentary is pretty awesome. turn it up please?? :)
[2:07:41] <frosty_frozon> THE BRAD SHOW
[2:07:43] <h0m3st4r> @barkon345 what about smash?
[2:07:44] <+zzer0zz1> wanna try me a guv
[2:07:44] <%Cgame_me811> @ryokupo Kreygasm
[2:07:45] <%ag_blues> VF4 was where I started many many moons ago.
[2:07:48] <%HawkGoggles2> VF 4 EVo reached in time and took all of the single player from this game. That's how much there was.
[2:07:49] <%GDT1985> Tekken being less grounded probably helped. What with bears and magic and whatnot.
[2:07:49] <+8bit_amethyst> Gladiolus
[2:07:50] <+aroo27> this stage looks wider here
[2:07:52] <XxKshawnxX> love jacky
[2:07:53] <+TM_rookie> Isnt Fudo like a VF god or something?
[2:07:53] <%Deezyfesheezy> @dwang I was just giving a reason as to why VF fell off. I actually prefer Sega to Bamco these days
[2:07:54] <%Stormo> VF4 quest mode was so fun
[2:07:56] <hobotech64> soul calibur though
[2:07:58] <Yuber0> too bad they remove the quest mode on the last VF5SD
[2:07:59] <+Owltosser> Quest is basically endless fighting AI players and unlocking costumes
[2:08:00] <%zane_dye> quest mode was the shit <3
[2:08:01] <%kyosukeneo89> Brad Kreygasm
[2:08:02] <Jaku2011> I just cannot imagine playing fighting games for single player, I just could never do it
[2:08:04] <%ryujithecoolslayer> doodOK doodOK doodOK doodOK doodOK
[2:08:05] <%sae_what> oh so like AI data
[2:08:05] <dark_tsukuyomi> Brad looks like Daigo Dojima
[2:08:05] <%retrozaid> That sounds like a Cool mode!
[2:08:06] <TerrorRISK> VF's World Tour mode?
[2:08:07] <%NicLuvin> Played the hell out of that honestly
[2:08:07] <+Quazington> VF4 was so top tier
[2:08:09] <hujkull> @TokenBlackDood like a fighting rpg where you fight ai based on real players
[2:08:09] <%TheArnett> Think of Pokemon Go chat
[2:08:13] <fgc_splash> WE MIGHT SEE A NEW SEGA CONSOLE BECAUSE VF?
[2:08:16] <%BeatdownGG> sc2 had a quest mode also
[2:08:16] <%undeadarchitect> doodYelp doodYelp doodYelp doodYelp doodYelp doodYelp
[2:08:17] <Daldondo> Dope customization too
[2:08:17] <qballgaymer> @hulkette510 Love the Bloody Roar series. Its a little jank, but I was a fan of the Primal Fury entry on GameCube
[2:08:18] <%TokenBlackDood> Ooohhhh, Thank you for that info. Never knew about quest mode
[2:08:20] <%Stormo> I really wish another fighting game would do something like quest mode, it was so fun
[2:08:20] <+Hareil0079> Vf 5 had quest mode
[2:08:20] <jukebox2014> the arcade master
[2:08:20] <%marc_x_ruckus> hype diggity
[2:08:20] <%TheGodSaw> Dude Quest mode was fantastic.
[2:08:21] <%king2beat> I remember when nba 2K21 games cost $20 cohhFeels
[2:08:21] <%SeanmanderPlays> Hmmm
[2:08:22] <%BlackMage66652> Virtua Quest playthrough when, Max
[2:08:23] <BreadMakerCTM> commentator going nuts
[2:08:23] <@evilmajikman> That mode was dope. Reminded me of SFA3's World Tour mode.
[2:08:24] <%OlivePowerRanger> Quest mode was bonkers. one of my favorite fighter single player mode ever
[2:08:25] <ChaosImpact> You basically a Gym leader of that arcade if you beat everyone in it
[2:08:25] <%KaynanLA> Holy god
[2:08:25] <+dasmesee> This is incredibly impressive to watch
[2:08:26] <%ryujithecoolslayer> so much damnage man
[2:08:26] <%Courser89> these costumes though...
[2:08:28] <Donsohl> the japanese guy yelling gets me every time lol
[2:08:31] <GTelias2212> @kaynanlee sorry i know that there's people that like the Saturn but my god i can't lie that the Saturn was SEGA's biggest mistake with the 32x. i like the Dreamcast waaaay better if only the Dreamcast wasn't dead because of the timing
[2:08:32] <elementor374> @fgc_splash Hell nah
[2:08:32] <+Hulkette510> I used to just rent Bloody Roar at Blockbuster over and over again LOL
[2:08:33] <+DieheroDie> Soul Caliber in arcades had that too.
[2:08:33] <%BeatdownGG> @fgc_splash nah bad business
[2:08:34] <%Kildaedra> You barely recognize the original characters LUL
[2:08:34] <%BrokemanJ> Look at that Wacky Jacky
[2:08:36] <DreamBoss__> vf EVOwas only 20$ on launch
[2:08:38] <%barkon345> and for some reason no one ever did anything like it again
[2:08:39] <waggylads> And who made shadowlands eh max
[2:08:40] <tamerlanethegreat> @Jaku2011 Never tried Streets of Rage? God Hand?
[2:08:43] <%Hellsiege> i always enjoyed soul cal 2-4 story modes
[2:08:43] <+Siosefa> i love goofy costumes, adds more personality
[2:08:47] <jaylonhasod01> when these costumes coming
[2:08:48] <%UltimateRedFire> Mobility is nuts.
[2:08:48] <AfternoonConcession> has there ever been crossovers with VF and any other fighting games? @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:08:49] <OptimusCack> you can always recognize volg's jacky lol
[2:08:50] <%FredIsBread> 2P 2P 2P 2P
[2:08:50] <%EnigmaticWolff> OOF
[2:08:51] <GilsoV> I kinda want to see what a good ass Shun plays like
[2:08:52] <+8bit_amethyst> LUL
[2:08:52] <%ryokupo> @fgc_splash No. LUL The console market doesn't have room for another player, and SEGA wants to actually make money.
[2:08:52] <XxKshawnxX> jaacky vs jacky holy fuukkkk
[2:08:55] <davey0000> Was MK the only FG that really was struggling during the PS2 era to find it's footing?
[2:08:58] <%KaynanLA> @GTelias2212 nah i totally get it bud
[2:09:04] <%ryokupo> DOA5
[2:09:05] <%Makriev> @Maximilian_DOOD regardless of being "Launched" now, would you say VF5 is one of the best games for new FG players?
[2:09:07] <Shinon17> the most skilled fighting clowns ever LUL

[2:10:05] <roxzor_0> @ryujithecoolslayer the release of the system was the same day that they announced the price of the console, and it was really expensive (400 on 94' was... well), plus the bad sales on the US while the Dreamcast was close of being released
[2:10:07] <Jag3rKhan> D:

[2:11:19] <%lido197> excuse me what the fuck?
[2:11:20] <GTelias2212> @kaynanlee and the reason of why i say the Saturn was SEGA's biggest mistake is because of how they build it putting 2 processors to make it powerful was the dumbest idea ever becauae that's not how it works and it makes the system difficult to develop

[2:17:26] <D7M_Hellcat> fuzzy right?
[2:17:27] <eternalabrys> Fuzzy
[2:17:28] <OptimusCack> fuzzy guard is the crouch dash block
[2:17:28] <%OmegaFatalis> I couldn't do this shit
[2:17:29] <%cocytusfgc> @Maximilian_DOOD What about step guard?
[2:17:31] <%wibbwobbler> Punishing in here is crazy
[2:17:33] <%MegaDyne> Yeah I don't understand how evation 2 works
[2:17:34] <drhivesphd> !glossary korean backdash
[2:17:34] <@Nightbot> https://glossary.infil.net/?t=korean%20backdash Fighting game lingo can be confusing. Just frames? DHC? OTG? What the hell is a Rekka!? Check out the incredible Fighting Game glossary made by Infil for more info
[2:17:35] <%Tricky_vfdc> it's what you do from -5 or less
[2:17:35] <sappinmahbinyot> chat *** short is el blaze
[2:17:35] <+Shemzlove> Bruh I was stuck on that earlier
[2:17:40] <%JIVEB0T> @tatsu00 nope
[2:17:41] <+frozeusgaming> fuzzy guard
[2:17:42] <Shinon17> @brunty023 sick, gotta try that
[2:17:44] <BenDonks> is korean back dash only a tekken thing?
[2:17:46] <XxKshawnxX> this mans grab is goros x ray
[2:17:47] <%TheKryptonian49> Oh this one is hard
[2:17:49] <Andrako> wHAT?
[2:17:49] <zenith0111> Built in OS?
[2:17:52] <+kenuran> This is Fuzzy Guard
[2:17:53] <%ryujithecoolslayer> dtchatHypeTrain dtchatHypeTrain dtchatHypeTrain
[2:17:55] <%ssj_gokus_legs> Whats with the training dummy WutFace
[2:17:57] <TheMostEpicUnicorn> I was so lost on this
[2:17:58] <%Brunty023> Yeah, this one I sorta struggle a bit
[2:17:58] <zhuravli> Fuzzy guard
[2:17:59] <+Cloudius> @Maximilian_DOOD its an option select defensive guard
[2:17:59] <+sol_badguy27> Is this an Option Select?
[2:18:01] <+Owltosser> wait that's op
[2:18:02] <abyssalsekiryu> took me awhile to clear this but i still dont get it
[2:18:04] <kobura57> yep fuzzy guard
[2:18:05] <fZarathustraN> @BenDonks yes
[2:18:05] <gr8mumzy5> stuck on this
[2:18:08] <jukebox2014> ohh that ?? yeaa its hard
[2:18:11] <indigoblooper> you have to let the first 2 attacks hit for this tutorial, and then do the move to dodge what comes after
[2:18:11] <%RUNNN3R> was that like a live feed of just random online VF games currently happening???
[2:18:15] <%buff_riku_says> you can do it after being hit
[2:18:16] <+stormhowl_fgc> @maximilian_dood You have to take the pk then do the fuzzy
[2:18:16] <Snowkoi_> have to take the first two hits then do it
[2:18:17] <zzz_nuke> i never understood that honestly. i skipped evasion
[2:18:17] <%freshcyborg> you got to let it hit you
[2:18:18] <%Inestimate> After the PK you do it
[2:18:19] <DSD24> I was stuck on this
[2:18:19] <ChaosImpact> Max been playing for 10 hrs and still has struggle with the tutorial LUL
[2:18:20] <FunnyCrimes> u have to buffer the dash
[2:18:20] <%Piro_____> This one i couldn't get 5 times in a row, at best 2 or 3
[2:18:21] <elementor374> In a row too? damn
[2:18:21] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> You gotta let them hit you, then do it after
[2:18:22] <+CHEETO_TAXES> You have to time it better I guess
[2:18:22] <%vash2pid0_o> I skipped this one LUL
[2:18:23] <+zzer0zz1> while rising guard i guess?
[2:18:24] <Kobukson> korean backdash is an exploit to be honest
[2:18:25] <%Brunty023> So you have to be hit by the K, P
[2:18:26] <Aji__> When the mall mannequins are PISSED
[2:18:27] <+SunOfAnarchy> yeah I couldn't do this one
[2:18:27] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Shit's tough
[2:18:28] <fgc_splash> MASTER THE FUZZY GUARD MAX GivePLZ
[2:18:29] <OptimusCack> basically crouch dashings makes you crouch faster than just holding down. it basically let's you duck throws but block standing in time for mids
[2:18:29] <Vaxas96> PowerUpL doodTerror PowerUpR
[2:18:30] <%Dharma_Bomb> Let the PK hit you then do it
[2:18:31] <%FoxLex_> You need to get first
[2:18:31] <Comb711> Get hit by the first string
[2:18:32] <%Frizen_101> @Maximilian_DOOD you have to do it after the cpu hits you
[2:18:32] <+SixMachine> @Maximilian_DOOD get hit by pk first then do the 33G
[2:18:32] <%TheKryptonian49> You have to take the hit
[2:18:33] <%Tricky_vfdc> take the hit
[2:18:33] <%GG_sensay> after  P K
[2:18:34] <KapteeniKosmos> after the 2hits
[2:18:34] <+kyledgradable> @maximilian_dood I saw some of your vf footage on Digital Foundry today super random
[2:18:34] <lanman85> Do it after the opponent's PK
[2:18:34] <%Tricky_vfdc> then 33
[2:18:34] <alinktothefutur3> This one confused me
[2:18:35] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood 33G you are just crunch dashing and blocking right after, think GG run then perfect guard
[2:18:37] <%ReKalibrate> get hit then do it
[2:18:37] <+LowJab> you will duck the throw and block the mid
[2:18:38] <%edxist78> @Maximilian_DOOD your are supposed to get hit first
[2:18:39] <%freshcyborg> let it hit you 1st then do it
[2:18:39] <%doodad_ounao> This one took a while because hitting 33 on dpad sucks and the window to hit it is hella low
[2:18:40] <+frozeusgaming> block first then fuzzy guard.
[2:18:40] <+Safetysteg> I couldn't figure this out earlier
[2:18:41] <jojopistachio> dash out of the way
[2:18:41] <%Man_in_the_Red> you let her go for the reset but OS to stop the reset
[2:18:42] <GothicLolitaAngel> I couldn’t get this one
[2:18:42] <+thatdemoguy> do it after the PK
[2:18:43] <%ArthurDoyleRPG> The music in tires game doodmaxhype
[2:18:43] <+TetraScar> After the PK.
[2:18:43] <%Inestimate> @Maximilian_DOOD Let the first two attacks hit you
[2:18:43] <kitehack21> after the PK
[2:18:43] <%Thetangmeister00> let it hit you the two times then do the 33g
[2:18:43] <chris1sega> after u get hit @maximilian_dood
[2:18:43] <+Bariman98> Gotta let them hit you the first two times
[2:18:44] <@shinkuhadoken1> press up or down as they attack
[2:18:44] <%doodad_ounao> Take the pk
[2:18:44] <Bulsokadoo> do it after you get hit twice
[2:18:44] <%Kenidashi> block highs, then dodge lows?
[2:18:45] <%NurseLee> Let PK hit then dash cancel
[2:18:45] <%Xxphantomprimexx> let the first two hits hit you then dash down animation
[2:18:45] <tjrayne> do it after the PK
[2:18:45] <shikimagura> after the pk
[2:18:45] <%the_capitan> let the cpu hit u off the pk then do the 33G
[2:18:46] <BenDonks> @fZarathustraN thx
[2:18:46] <doomorhope> after the pk
[2:18:47] <+Seph_0> @Maximilian_DOOD you need to let the first to hits connect and then you do df df guard
[2:18:47] <%CurryCloud> You have to let them hit you for the first 2 huts
[2:18:47] <%ram_lethal> VF
[2:18:48] <mrscoo> get hit and then dash
[2:18:49] <hujkull> let him hit you forr the first 2 , then block or avoid after
[2:18:49] <%Tricky_vfdc> you need to get hit tho
[2:18:49] <HmongCalibur> dash down only when they throw
[2:18:50] <zenith0111> Is there a while standing state like tekken?
[2:18:50] <greycreeze2345> do it after the pk hits you
[2:18:50] <EscapetheBait> get hit then do the down gaurd
[2:18:50] <smilinzombie> get hit first
[2:18:51] <+GreetingsMortal> Get hit first then do it
[2:18:51] <%Jflaskd13> LUL
[2:18:51] <lacarimyhome> is this game upgrade with dragon engine?
[2:18:52] <dragonscale201> I didn't understand this at all either
[2:18:52] <+Dragunnz> that statue is an incredible fighter D:
[2:18:53] <@VarryoChoco> get it
[2:18:54] <%Silent4larm> I had trouble doing this shit this morning
[2:18:54] <%quique_schz> you get hit then do the dash
[2:18:54] <%TheKryptonian49> you have to take the first two hits
[2:18:56] <%doodad_ounao> then do it before the next throw / attack
[2:18:56] <SuddenDeath> 33
[2:18:58] <@VarryoChoco> get hit
[2:19:02] <MrBuncakes> get hit by the first 2 attacks, then do df,df,n,g
[2:19:02] <%ssj_gokus_legs> PogChamp
[2:19:06] <marques103> Ok Max night time see you later your the Best!!!!!!!!!
[2:19:06] <%Tricky_vfdc> the wall will mess it up
[2:19:07] <qballgaymer> What fighter would you compare the VF countering system to? DOA? SoulCal?
[2:19:09] <%BlackMage66652> That training dummy activates the horny for me for some reason
[2:19:12] <JustJoeGD> Take the hit and then do it
[2:19:13] <@shinkuhadoken1> it's teaching you that you can still dodge even after getting hit
[2:19:14] <%Brogox> I got frustrated with controller when trying these.
[2:19:16] <%vash2pid0_o> Wasn't fast enough to react if it's gonna do a throw or jab
[2:19:21] <Shinon17> @lacarimyhome remade in dragon engine
[2:19:23] <%Tricky_vfdc> tha tmeans you're 33 ing too slow
[2:19:23] <black_mishima> uhh wave dashing with a mishima is usually used for mixups, to ge ta mid or low int a hellsweep followup and getting in on opponents in tekken, not for catching lows LUL
[2:19:23] <kobura57> IT'S A CROUCH DASH CANCEL
[2:19:24] <indigoblooper> the input is really quick
[2:19:26] <%sae_what> Gotta throw tech opposite way
[2:19:26] <ChaosImpact> it's basically a quicker recovery for block
[2:19:30] <%Tricky_vfdc> buffer that in while you're getting  kicked
[2:19:30] <AfternoonConcession> grabs are the fastest thing in the game at 10 frames @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:19:32] <+timw2sleep> guard on slide dash  startup os @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:19:34] <%inajefflymanner> you have to do it in a row? nope
[2:19:34] <%the_capitan> if u get hit by throw its cause u gotta crouch step into it
[2:19:35] <+Cloudius> @Maximilian_DOOD you are supposed to avoid the throw
[2:19:37] <%the_capitan> tap tap
[2:19:38] <Vaxas96> PowerUpL doodTerror PowerUpR
[2:19:38] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood 33G you are just crunch dashing and blocking right after, think GG run then perfect block
[2:19:38] <+SixMachine> @Maximilian_DOOD this should cover both options, you go under the throw
[2:19:39] <xdarkshiftx> this shit took me a while
[2:19:39] <+stormhowl_fgc> Double tap hold
[2:19:43] <+LowJab> duck the block the mid tap
[2:19:43] <+frameperfectarcade> don't you need to stay down?
[2:19:43] <+James44446> he gonna play online tonight?
[2:19:44] <%Tricky_vfdc> tap or hold really
[2:19:44] <%zane_dye> tap
[2:19:46] <Wartogh> this is too much technical for my brain to handle during an actual match
[2:19:47] <Comb711> tap
[2:19:48] <chris1sega> it's basically a combo check @maximilian_dood
[2:19:49] <%Tricky_vfdc> tap better
[2:19:49] <%Dubiyus> Tap...return to neutral
[2:19:55] <%sae_what> OH I SEE
[2:19:56] <+zzer0zz1> ayyy
[2:19:58] <%Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> OH!
[2:20:00] <%sae_what> U can dash under throws
[2:20:00] <%retrozaid> tap
[2:20:00] <t_hawk_typhoon> @vash2pid0_o You're not supposed to react, it's an option select that beats both
[2:20:01] <fgc_splash> THIS IS WHY TUTORIAL GETS DEEP, TEACHES U HIGH LEVEL TECH claraaHeart
[2:20:02] <zzz_nuke> so close
[2:20:05] <Snowkoi_> getting it

[2:20:26] <%sae_what> ACTUAL MICRO DUCKS
[2:20:27] <%Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> So its an OS? @maximilian_dood
[2:20:28] <HmongCalibur> evasion 4 is by far the hardest imo
[2:20:28] <+GreetingsMortal> It’s a core OS. Generally use it at -5

[2:20:41] <angstar360> Why is everybody playing Jackie ???
[2:20:41] <GilsoV> In this training, you're not trying to tech the throw, you're trying to duck it, cause throws are faster than any button
[2:20:43] <%BeatdownGG> @ssj_gokus_legs nope
[2:20:44] <MimicTheDragon> Success triWOAH
[2:20:44] <BenDonks> this game is fucking sick

[2:21:07] <qballgaymer> @ssj_gokus_legs It does NOT have rollback. it's delay based
[2:21:08] <ChaosImpact> it's a jack of all trade throw tech
[2:21:08] <greycreeze2345> try Evasion 4
[2:21:08] <CommanderSqueaks> My smooth brain is catching fire trying to comprehend everything that I've been seeing.
[2:21:09] <+CHEETO_TAXES> This game has a bunch of OS like this
[2:21:11] <%FredIsBread> should duck highs
[2:21:13] <+ohKrypticc> MK11 has the same thing just harder I suppose
[2:21:14] <%LemonforceNA> this game only has P K and G right?
[2:21:18] <Meezymoney23 > movement in this game feels weird
[2:21:19] <%Bealy_beal> that would wreck wolf
[2:21:24] <Yagami2004> if theres 1 thing different in VF then almost all fighters .. its better to always have ur stick neutral

[2:21:54] <%doodad_ounao> I need to buy a stick BibleThump

[2:21:56] <%OmniSTylez> nice

[2:22:05] <%NoesNobody> Max leveled up
[2:22:07] <%wizchiefa23> @omegazerox2 jaboodySmug
[2:22:07] <kumasGaming> Hi everyone !!! How is the net code for this game !??
[2:22:08] <+CarnageSizor> juice box says from +6 to +9 you can't duck the throw
[2:22:09] <ChaosImpact> IT BLOCK MID AS WELL!?
[2:22:10] <CommanderSqueaks> What I've learned today is that the most dangerous fighter in Virtual Fighter 5 is the wall
[2:22:10] <+dwarriorsn> you need to be wild
[2:22:13] <+CHEETO_TAXES> Delay grab ?
[2:22:14] <%freshcyborg> Now do the side step version
[2:22:15] <%Bazal68k> I couldn't figure the timing on that one. Thanks for showing!
[2:22:16] <%ilyk3urface> VF is probably the only game I would say to learn how to dodge and block before you learn how to fight
[2:22:16] <+stormhowl_fgc> PK fake outs
[2:22:16] <+Owltosser> @tatsu00 he did it going through Jean's move list, but don't think he did it in actual match yet
[2:22:17] <zenith0111> The skill gaps in this game seem huge lol
[2:22:17] <%wizchiefa23> My ninja
[2:22:19] <+Siosefa> this is something Tekken is missing
[2:22:20] <%quique_schz> what you were looking for was evasion 4 i think
[2:22:20] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Go low or down throw or something
[2:22:23] <SuddenDeath> DELAY
[2:22:23] <Nayafer91> try throw tech holing G+ P and a direction(4, 5, 6) for a auto tech.
[2:22:23] <%LemonforceNA> @ChaosImpact  yeah
[2:22:23] <%NurseLee> @Maximilian_DOOD just watch out for characters who have crouch-throws too

[2:22:45] <%Makriev> Wolf also have a mid/low grab, right?
[2:22:48] <tatsu00> @Owltosser ahh ok thx, I cant land it lol
[2:22:49] <%doodad_ounao> @kumasgaming Good delay based but still delay based. Apparently uses relay servers in the middle of the locations to reduce lag.
[2:22:50] <%BeatdownGG> @kefka_himself the only people who do don't play either
[2:22:50] <kobura57> it blocks mid if you did it right and fast dnough yes

[2:23:07] <@Nightbot> https://glossary.infil.net/?t= Fighting game lingo can be confusing. Just frames? DHC? OTG? What the hell is a Rekka!? Check out the incredible Fighting Game glossary made by Infil for more info
[2:23:09] <Damon_Dynamic1> I'm so surprised modern fighters don't teach this stuff in their Training modes
[2:23:10] <+Clembo2021> @kefka_himself i always thought VF was a simplified tekken. i was such a fool

[2:24:01] <%GDT1985> Practice the button hold technique?
[2:24:04] <+Quazington> VF is a 5Head game
[2:24:06] <%PseuDEEnym> VF and Tekken are more technical than most fighting games
[2:24:07] <%Bazal68k> Damn there's so much to the trades in this game.
[2:24:07] <jnexgen717> SeemsGood
[2:24:07] <chris1sega> try that with launcher @maximilian_dood

[2:24:30] <+nolifegamin> jeez this is crazy deep
[2:24:30] <+stormhowl_fgc> If you're getting thrown left side tech with left and vice versa
[2:24:31] <@shinkuhadoken1> yo it teaches lots of good shit
[2:24:31] <%BeatdownGG> @ChaosImpact game came out yesterday, might need to wait a bit

[2:24:37] <+CHEETO_TAXES> "Improve things"
[2:24:40] <%LocalAlienParty> essentially play the tutorial every single day LUL
[2:24:46] <OptimusCack> basically you can fuzzy guard out of an evade
[2:24:48] <%FredIsBread> yes
[2:24:49] <OkamiDude15> Promove! PogChamp
[2:24:53] <+Clembo2021> i feel like such a boomer when i am too slow for throw techs in every game
[2:24:57] <+SixMachine> defensive move is just sidestep
[2:25:00] <%Clenchmask> True 3D fighting
[2:25:04] <GTelias2212> @pseudeenym because both are 3D Fighters both has more options than 2D
[2:25:05] <Bulsokadoo> just the sidestep?
[2:25:12] <%ReKalibrate> you just sidestep without pkg
[2:25:13] <jerry4050> doodCake
[2:25:15] <The_Vulgar_Ape> defensive move is just side step
[2:25:16] <+cmac92> @chaosimpact Look up Awesmic on YouTube. he has it
[2:25:17] <SlenDragon> @Maximilian_DOOD I'm heading to bed. Have a great rest of the stream doods.
[2:25:22] <%Bholorak> no defensive move is just sidestep up or down
[2:25:22] <+timw2sleep> def move is simply side step @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:25:22] <DoodTheKid> This is the one I gave up on lol
[2:25:23] <%Adrin_Manic> just sidestep. if you pkg, it's offensive
[2:25:25] <+Siosefa> they're just giving out free lessons, VF creators worst nightmare Kappa
[2:25:29] <wiqidbritt> Just regular sidestep pkg is offensive move
[2:25:36] <%Tricky_vfdc> is this the evade cancel one?
[2:25:40] <kefka_himself> this is a true 3d fighting game, thats how i seen this since the 1st virtua fighter
[2:25:41] <%thedankestmeeme> r3
[2:25:41] <ChaosImpact> @cmac92 Many thanks, friend
[2:25:43] <AfternoonConcession> some characters have throw preferences (wolf likes forward throwing because his most damaging ones are forward) so holding forward P+G will get you out when they're auto piloting to damage @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:25:44] <%jonboy204> @Maximilian_DOOD Do you know the LAZY THROW TECH?
[2:25:46] <Mormegil84> I couldn't do this one

[2:26:18] <+Clembo2021> they shouldnt have walls during some of these
[2:26:19] <+SixMachine> @Maximilian_DOOD you can start to buffer the sidestep during the time you are hit by the kick
[2:26:20] <%Crim1223> lmao
[2:26:22] <+TheGreatSunbro> Just use r3 on the arcade stick
[2:26:23] <%Tricky_vfdc> what did it want him to do?

[2:26:31] <+GreetingsMortal> lots of sticks have r3 now tbf
[2:26:31] <%doodad_ounao> yep, this one has a very short window too, have to be fast as fuck
[2:26:32] <FunnyCrimes> @Maximilian_DOOD buffer the sidestep out of hitstun the buffer window is huge
[2:26:34] <+BoonsSauce> You’re doing offensive not defensive
[2:26:36] <%Tricky_vfdc> what was explination?
[2:26:37] <CommanderSqueaks> Jean going to end up with a concussion LUL
[2:26:37] <+stormhowl_fgc> @maximilian_dood You have a huge buffer window so you can essentially dial a combo the 66g after side step
[2:26:37] <tisfeelgood> you cant side stepo the kick
[2:26:37] <Damon_Dynamic1> he using his game pad no controller guys
[2:26:38] <GTelias2212> also both VF and Tekken are differents in buttons Tekken is a 4 button fighter meanwhile VF is 3 buttons. . .well mostly 2 because one button is to block sorta like Mortal Kombat
[2:26:39] <PKthundurr> crouch maybe?
[2:26:39] <%Godot_Goestar> R3 is the in the back of the controller next to r4.
[2:26:41] <%TokenBlackDood> are you suppose to block the PK?

[2:27:04] <indigoblooper> cancel sidestep into forward dash guard
[2:27:05] <Xcheaster> Sidestep initial hit then forward forward g
[2:27:05] <%aklee78> side step + ff + guard super fast
[2:27:08] <jojounin> you need to do it really fast, it works
[2:27:09] <%SharpsPanda> When I did thisI had trouble aswell. After I inputed I auto input Forward forward guard
[2:27:11] <+Cloudius> Cancel your side step with forward forward G

[2:27:15] <+freakin_uuuh> @maximilian_dood you just have to do it hella fast
[2:27:17] <%Tricky_vfdc> right after tapping up
[2:27:23] <doomorhope> the timing is super specific
[2:27:23] <+TheGreatSunbro> @BeatdownGG LMAO Just JAM the stick into the box. Works for me.
[2:27:24] <%SharpsPanda> After I side stepped I input Forward forward guard *
[2:27:30] <%FunnyCrimes> @Imperfect_Zemra doodbenny thanks dudeski
[2:27:31] <%doodad_ounao> LUL
[2:27:37] <8mmspikes> So its like a parry?
[2:27:37] <zenith0111> WAX ON WAX OFF
[2:27:39] <seniorconej0> you have the signs that you cant evade the last one, is on the right part of the screen   @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:27:41] <Jag3rKhan> Good rest of stream chat ! SeemsGood VoHiYo Haha2020
[2:27:43] <Vaxas96> that's no tutorial bot he beat the shit out of us
[2:27:43] <%LemonforceNA> so after u side step but before u get kicked
[2:27:47] <$CladedArmor> its timing based hehe
[2:27:49] <DJ_is_Raiden> do it in the other direction maybe?
[2:27:54] <%BeatdownGG> @TheGreatSunbro something tells me thats never worked for you luipoCREEP
[2:27:54] <DNICE3838> id play this today its best vf5  in yrs n music n stages awesome
[2:27:56] <kobura57> FASTER AFTER THE NEUTRAL OF YOUR STEP
[2:27:57] <@gravemind_z> This game is so technical NotLikeThis
[2:27:58] <%BeatdownGG> lupoCREEP
[2:28:03] <%Vylent_> like soulcalibur?
[2:28:03] <AfternoonConcession> it's saying the direction it's coming from next to the dummy @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:28:05] <%Tricky_vfdc> it's just a speed thing
[2:28:07] <+RangoTangoSeven> Get hit by second hit, press down then forward forward G. Quickly tho
[2:28:10] <+ZRO4825> You basically have to input the sidestep right before the hitstun wears off then super fast on the double tap into G.
[2:28:12] <+timw2sleep> its basically a os for correction oerror or biting
[2:28:12] <%Tricky_vfdc> one of the harder mechanics
[2:28:16] <Falteredgreed> I like that the game forces you to learn by reseting the counter when you mess up
[2:28:16] <kefka_himself> @maximilian_dood you got this
[2:28:17] <ChaosImpact> this is hard for a tutorial
[2:28:20] <maese_leo> perhaps you must evade the first two hits, then FF on the kick?

[2:28:47] <A_m_v_J> This looks like character alignment issue you are facing.
[2:28:48] <%Tricky_vfdc> dashing too late after the 8
[2:28:48] <+TheMarkoftheWolves> This one frustrated the crap out of me today
[2:28:51] <seniorconej0> @Maximilian_DOOD you are trying to avoid the one that you cant evade... check the signs next to the dummy and the right part of the screen
[2:28:54] <%doodad_ounao> @kumasgaming night dood doodBro doodBro
[2:28:55] <%wizchiefa23> danSexy
[2:28:55] <%Tetsuya5963> doodMash doodCrazy
[2:28:55] <KRU_tk> you can't just block during a sidestep so you cancel the animation by dashing forward
[2:28:57] <chris1sega> lvl 4
[2:28:57] <emersoncwb> buffer the 1st input
[2:28:58] <%SharpsPanda> max  I had an easier time side stepping to the right for some reason when I did this
[2:28:58] <%BananaTheBread> yeah i just noticed what you're suppose to do cause its on the right side of the screen LUL
[2:29:00] <SKEWR13> Hello @shinmegami_0
[2:29:02] <Xcheaster> You sidestep right it shows you right next to the bot when he does the first move to sidestep it rifht
[2:29:03] <blackfr0g> Do side step Down+ Down
[2:29:04] <%Tricky_vfdc> don't even pause just do it all one motion
[2:29:06] <%Brunty023> @maese_leo Nah, it wouldn't count. You basically have to get hit by the two hits, then sidestep dash cancel into block
[2:29:08] <%OlivePowerRanger> @unknownkidx believe vanessa
[2:29:08] <valokiteshvara> I had to skip this one. No chance unless i wanted to spend all day at it
[2:29:11] <+RangoTangoSeven> Instead of up, do down @maximilian_dood
[2:29:11] <HmongCalibur> it's like 1 or 2 frames oe something.
[2:29:12] <CommanderSqueaks> @TalonXI92 I think low punch has been a meme in Virtual Fighter for years for a reason.
[2:29:14] <Mormegil84> I just eventually gave up on this one LUL
[2:29:15] <RetroRadTV> why are low attacks so easy to spam in this game
[2:29:16] <tacticalnuke002> @unknownkidx This Dural is using Vanessa iirc
[2:29:16] <Vaxas96> hello dood @shinmegami_0
[2:29:23] <%doodad_ounao> @themarkofthewolves Evasion 2 is still what keeps me up at night
[2:29:23] <kobura57> It's not hard when you understood it
[2:29:25] <%SharpsPanda> Try side stepping to the right. That helped me a lot
[2:29:25] <+CHEETO_TAXES> Maybe buffer the sidestep during hit stun
[2:29:25] <%Tricky_vfdc> he got it
[2:29:26] <Novinworks> Is this evasion 4?
[2:29:31] <+TheGreatSunbro> @BeatdownGG Trust me I'm a doctor.
[2:29:32] <%Frizen_101> @InfiniteDrillWorks its teaching you how to not get hit if you try to evade an unevadable
[2:29:34] <%sae_what> Do u feel it now Mr Krabs?
[2:29:36] <%QuintessenceHD> Damn shame this game is delay netcode, because it is insanely fun.
[2:29:36] <@gravemind_z> @Lycus_Jhin_Grace can't help but make constant comparisons in my brain
[2:29:39] <maese_leo> @Brunty023 I see, that's hard!
[2:29:40] <+Siosefa> definitely going to eat more ingame than evade
[2:29:41] <%Brunty023> @NOVINworks Yup!
[2:29:43] <%JIVEB0T> @NOVINworks yes
[2:29:45] <+stormhowl_fgc> @maximilian_dood You can cancel side step into forward dash, you don't have to wait to input 66
[2:29:49] <GTelias2212> if you don't know the mechanics of it and it's character functions the game is gonna destroy you
[2:29:49] <kefka_himself> @novinworks yes
[2:29:52] <nazirr_> this shit is hard af
[2:29:52] <CallTheEVAC> Basically it's like tracking moves in Tekken. They're slower then Linear moves so you can Step and Block accordingly. VF just needs a dash cancel guard input.
[2:29:53] <mopeycat> @valokiteshvara Not in a day, you need 5 years to get good.
[2:29:54] <%Tetsuya5963> Feel it doodMash doodCrazy
[2:29:54] <x_art_of_life_x> This track is bangin' tho SourPls
[2:29:55] <black_mishima> @TalonXI92 I have for sure, but thats cuz idk what Im doing, Im sure like me and many others, people just dont counter or something. LUL im sure we can get pretty heavily punished for doing it
[2:29:58] <%wizchiefa23> Become thy enemy max
[2:30:02] <unkn39> its casual friendly.....you dont need to learn this to play for fun...
[2:30:03] <+unceunceunce1912> Virtua Evader 5
[2:30:03] <%krystalcute91> hey guys good afternoon
[2:30:04] <reverbzz> woot woot
[2:30:05] <%Dakuu75> this looks hard-as-fuck if Max is struggling
[2:30:05] <Unknownkidx> Oh right Vanessa. I forgot she is a pretty tall character

[2:30:07] <%SharpsPanda> @Maximilian_DOOD Try side stepping to the right. It was easier for me
[2:30:09] <%Tricky_vfdc> he's trying @stormhowl_fgc just kinda hard
[2:30:10] <%Brunty023> @maese_leo It's fast execution in a very short window
[2:30:10] <agusper11> Good thing I stopped at evasion 1 LUL
[2:30:10] <Harrason> how frame perfect is this thing
[2:30:14] <DJ_is_Raiden> do it downwards
[2:30:17] <%inajefflymanner> this sounds like a guilty gear track
[2:30:18] <%BBboy20> this been the only tutorial part i've yet to beat
[2:30:20] <Meezymoney23 > tutorial boss rage LUL
[2:30:20] <%Tricky_vfdc> it breaks your hands
[2:30:20] <+allastor21> use the indicators to determine which way to side step
[2:30:20] <%identitydisc> CoolStoryBob
[2:30:22] <%SquallAdv> doodMash doodMash doodMash doodInjury
[2:30:22] <FlavioNG> by the sound
[2:30:22] <%FunnyCrimes> the trial gets a lot easier if you buffer the sidestep early out of histun @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:30:26] <%QuintessenceHD> I skipped this one, spent 30 minutes on it.
[2:30:26] <zenith0111> Other games will let you fudge it a little but this game demands you know what youre doing lol
[2:30:29] <greycreeze2345> it's around 3 frames
[2:30:29] <OnTwitch_Hiding> Injustice 2 or DBFZ? You have to choose right now
[2:30:31] <+timw2sleep> its really worth to get familiar with @Maximilian_DOOD but tottally unnatural
[2:30:32] <%Dakuu75> doodInjury
[2:30:33] <%Bealy_beal> doodInjury doodInjury doodInjury
[2:30:34] <Novinworks> @brunty023 @jiveb0t Thanks!
[2:30:34] <CommanderSqueaks> This is the boss of the tutorials. XD
[2:30:35] <+GreetingsMortal> It’s much easier on pad
[2:30:36] <chocobo_coco> how practical is this mechanic
[2:30:37] <%NoesNobody> doodInjury
[2:30:37] <+nolifegamin> carpal tunnel monkaS
[2:30:38] <TalonXI92> is this that hard
[2:30:40] <Mormegil84> Imagine doing this in a match LUL
[2:30:41] <DNICE3838> wat music you playing max  from the game jw
[2:30:42] <Xcheaster> @maximilian_dood the icon next to the bot is an icon to sidestep right and you are supposed to sidestep the hits on this one
[2:30:45] <@gravemind_z> This is like KOF XIII trials
[2:30:46] <%V00__D00> try downward
[2:30:46] <chris1sega> DFDF3
[2:30:46] <%vexion_smh> damn I can't believe VF5 got queen beast as an CPU
[2:30:47] <+tabenterenter> 33 instead of 66?
[2:30:47] <+RonnieDobbs69> WutFace muh hand
[2:30:48] <Lycus_Jhin_Grace> on hitbox that would be easy af i think
[2:30:48] <%JIVEB0T> @NOVINworks yw
[2:30:50] <%RofflessLWK> Say goodbye to your hands after this tutorial doodInjury doodInjury doodInjury
[2:30:50] <meatyc0chin0> get it Max
[2:30:50] <jukebox2014> plinking guard?
[2:30:50] <+chaosreaper0> this feels like it would be almost impossible with any lag online
[2:30:51] <keroblack2> so you need to get 2 hit first before you can evade? or you can block and evade all 3 hits?
[2:30:51] <valokiteshvara> I mean just this tutorial would take all day
[2:30:52] <%MegaDyne> strange. this one was easier for me than Evasion 2.
[2:30:54] <Snowkoi_> yeah I got it down pretty easy on pad
[2:30:54] <%BBboy20> easier, huh?
[2:30:54] <%Tricky_vfdc> @chocobo_coco highly practical
[2:30:54] <+RangoTangoSeven> After second hit, Down + F, F, G @maximilian_dood
[2:30:56] <%cheddajones92> Between this an DOA which is harder? doodInjury @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:30:57] <tamerlanethegreat> For Jean, it's a face-destroyer.
[2:30:58] <black_mishima> i definitely think this is harder to do on stick than fight stick
[2:30:58] <%quique_schz> it's a liitle bit early that it feels, it feels more like canceling the sidestep
[2:31:00] <kefka_himself> @maximilian_dood we getting old lol
[2:31:00] <%VaderOfLocksley> doodInjury doodStare
[2:31:01] <AfternoonConcession> is it a timing thing like a parry or more of a general movement that is precise? @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:31:02] <%OmegaZeroX2> doodInjury doodInjury doodInjury doodInjury doodInjury
[2:31:03] <Wiiplayah43> @inajefflymanner the whole soundtrack are bangers
[2:31:04] <%TheKryptonian49> Yeah this is way easier on pad
[2:31:05] <@shinkuhadoken1> @Tricky_vfdc who's "fenderSX" ? do u know? he's a wolf
[2:31:09] <drhivesphd> INJURY
[2:31:10] <%wizchiefa23> Hmmm
[2:31:10] <%Tricky_vfdc> @Lycus_Jhin_Grace this mechanic destoryed my hands on stick and made me go hitbox
[2:31:12] <kobura57> Max immeditately after you pressed up and as fast as possible for the crouch dash
[2:31:12] <OptimusCack> it's a lot of hand aerobics for a quasi-option select, yeah
[2:31:14] <DJ_is_Raiden> use the indicators on the right max please
[2:31:15] <%Brunty023> @TalonXI92 It's a short window to do it, but it's possible
[2:31:15] <%Bealy_beal> doodInjury doodCrazy
[2:31:18] <%TheLegendofTims> you have to side step the direction it's telling you for it to work
[2:31:18] <%cheddajones92> possibly
[2:31:19] <+kynelwynn> So when character customization?
[2:31:19] <%Tricky_vfdc> na dunno him @shinkuhadoken1
[2:31:20] <%SeanmanderPlays> MY HANDS doodInjury
[2:31:21] <%ilyk3urface> @maximilian_dood you can also do DFDF G
[2:31:21] <+Siosefa> this destroys your hand, KOF destroys your soul
[2:31:25] <+RocketeerWasAmazing> This is where I got stuck on the tutorial
[2:31:25] <%Adwark> @gravemind_z Except it isn't just some fancy combo, but relevant gameplay mechanics that are meant to be used in actual matches LUL
[2:31:26] <jerry5055> sharrk2Ok
[2:31:26] <Immortal_Volkan> evade downwards first.
[2:31:27] <OkamiDude15> @vexion_smh LMAO i was thinking it looked familiar earlier
[2:31:29] <greycreeze2345> @cheddajones92 This is waaaaay harder
[2:31:30] <@shinkuhadoken1> this is quite high level stuff too
[2:31:34] <%rabadaglan> oh yeah the floating icon. says "Can't Evade". Does that mean you cant sidestep or am i wrong?

[2:31:46] <FlavioNG> by the sound easier
[2:31:47] <%Tricky_vfdc> i think maybe tekken players might be only ones with similar feeling timing
[2:31:48] <%vexion_smh> LUL
[2:31:48] <Xcheaster> Max the game is telling you to skdestep rkght
[2:31:49] <Vaxas96> PowerUpL doodTerror PowerUpR stop hitting the face bot
[2:31:50] <DNICE3838> i love the customs of the fighters withthe bundle n dlc its so worth $10
[2:31:50] <meatyc0chin0> never surrender
[2:31:50] <CommanderSqueaks> @rabadaglan Yes
[2:31:51] <+Jixx_47> Lol evasion 4. Could not get this one
[2:31:57] <+RangoTangoSeven> Easier on pad fosho
[2:31:57] <chris1sega> ur cue is on the screen @maximilian_dood
[2:31:59] <mopeycat> Let's go carpool tunnel!
[2:31:59] <%Bholorak> @rabadaglan correct
[2:32:00] <%SHIN0BILI> SHIN0BILI subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 73 months! I had a really tough time doing these too
[2:32:01] <%Aidonis> Easier with hitbox or pad potentially?

[2:32:03] <%Juicebox_FGC> Juicebox_FGC subscribed with Prime. 
[2:32:04] <Kaenrin> Jean getting his brain destroyed by a thousand cinderblock kicks to the face.
[2:32:04] <%BananaTheBread> @rabadaglan Yeah, its directions for the tutorial
[2:32:08] <Meezymoney23 > this game is sooo much harder than tekken
[2:32:08] <Falteredgreed> You have to side step the other direction I think it might be easier that way
[2:32:09] <%zane_dye> yup. imagine trying to do this on a ps5 controller.. its frustrating.. im missing my sticks.
[2:32:09] <Leinharts> how are you supposed to use this in a match
[2:32:10] <+timw2sleep> ss delayed ff + g
[2:32:11] <%MrMidLife> I donlt know anybody in their right mind who's using this technique. Are there elite players giving demos?
[2:32:13] <kefka_himself> kof easy and fun lol
[2:32:16] <@gravemind_z> @Adwark yep, mechanics needed multiple times a match in tourney, beyond me lol
[2:32:17] <%Tricky_vfdc> make sure you're not hit from the side or it won't work
[2:32:23] <%Kalzassa> @Juicebox_FGC doodDood doodSweet
[2:32:23] <Xelae93> How do you dash that fast on a stick? Your wrist has to be hurting like hell.
[2:32:25] <Wiiplayah43> @rabadaglan cannot sidestep
[2:32:25] <%cheddajones92> @greycreeze2345 I can agree Ive completed most of DOA training mode except some of DOA 4 but 5 and 6 were easy.
[2:32:28] <%Mattman162> I gave up at this and felt bad, now I feel less bad seeing max and chat confirm that it indeed is hard lol

[2:32:33] <%ReKalibrate> @rabadaglan yeah you cNt sidestep that move so the game is telling you, you CAN cancel the step and block it.
[2:32:34] <Immortal_Volkan> max evade down first
[2:32:36] <RocTager> Pad Warriors Rise! This games for you!
[2:32:36] <%crazyyshaman> crazyyshaman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:32:38] <%Kageromaru> @rabadaglan this trial requires you to tap 266 +G in rapid succession affter Dural's PK.  It's tough as hell.
[2:32:41] <zenith0111> Even once you get used to this one and seems hard to do mid match
[2:32:43] <%Bholorak> you need to be very fast
[2:32:43] <Dezrik> yea it was very easy on a pad
[2:32:43] <73001> isn't it impossible to evade the third attack
[2:32:45] <Novinworks> @JuiceBox_FGC in da house!
[2:32:47] <%Bluestto> Having smash be my only fighting game experience I literally can’t fathom how hard this game must be. Looks really cool tho
[2:32:50] <hohenheimfmh> shit man, this looks hard!
[2:32:51] <Casual_Steve_> im pretty sure your evading the wrong way. look at the symbol at the side
[2:32:51] <%cheddajones92> @kefka_himself KOF easy no. Fun yes. Not as difficult but somewhat a challenge, like a 3/5.
[2:32:52] <+Cloudius> @rabadaglan you can't sidestep but you can cancel the sidestep so you dont get clipped, the side step is good in the vent that the opponent doesnt do a full circular move
[2:32:52] <llllovetttt> how is this supposed to ever be used?
[2:32:53] <%BananaTheBread> @MrMidLife They do if you watched the pros, they are literally weaving through hits and blocking shit like this
[2:32:53] <%Tricky_vfdc> i use 33
[2:32:57] <%rabadaglan> oh i see.
[2:32:57] <kobura57> MAX IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU PRESSED UP YOU CROUCH DASH AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
[2:33:01] <%ilyk3urface> Ooooh it tells you which side to step to
[2:33:01] <lifeofceejay> ayejay10Hey ayejay10Hey ayejay10Hey
[2:33:03] <%Deezyfesheezy> @gtelias2212 Soul Calibur is the only 3D game that's easy to play honestly
[2:33:04] <Xcheaster> @maximilian_dood it specifically wants you to sidestep the first hits to the right
[2:33:05] <Sadrobotman> @Maximilian_DOOD i think the game is telling you to evade towards the screen
[2:33:07] <hivehivehivehivehivehive> is there a character with hyper armor in this game?
[2:33:09] <DJ_is_Raiden> down down
[2:33:13] <+timw2sleep> dont wait for visual indicator @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:33:16] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood do the evade towards the screen for you to have more time
[2:33:18] <+RangoTangoSeven> Instead of Up, try going Down
[2:33:19] <%MoonxLxght> They never stopped playing LUL for years they waited for this moment
[2:33:20] <patontheblock> He’s stepping the wrong way
[2:33:22] <+Bariman98> Try going towards the sreen instead
[2:33:23] <Kobukson> tricky i always thought you were a girl lol
[2:33:24] <OzLogWarTooth> @Maximilian_DOOD  at least it's like real life in training too. getting there ass beat trying to learn how to defend themselfs.
[2:33:24] <GTelias2212> who the f says KOF is easy?? l
[2:33:25] <%Zakk219> @Xelae93 you use your hand not your wrist to move the arcade stick.  If you're using too much wrist, it's gonna hurt.
[2:33:25] <%the_volcanic_masochist> Its telling you what you can and can't evade on the right
[2:33:26] <%SharpsPanda> This one took me a long time as well.
[2:33:32] <i_are_beedo> why you stream so late? fuuuuck!
[2:33:34] <%FunnyCrimes> sidestep buffering is really lenient in this game which makes it way easier to get the 66 as soon as you can
[2:33:38] <%MrMidLife> @BananaTheBread holly crap.  In that case I'mma keep trying.  It must just be a case of dialing your brain into it.
[2:33:38] <kefka_himself> @cheddajones92  well for me it is
[2:33:40] <Meranglemtur> I feel the pain in my wrist watching you do this @maximilian_dood
[2:33:42] <%Tricky_vfdc> @Kobukson Tricky is Tricky :D
[2:33:42] <AfternoonConcession> so is this like a complex option select?
[2:33:42] <%Mattman162> @Maximilian_DOOD wrong way evading
[2:33:44] <meatyc0chin0> MAX !MAX! MAX!
[2:33:45] <%Bloodninja15> Chat plz it doesnt matter which way he evades
[2:33:46] <%Aidonis> @Juicebox_FGC Cheers mate, hope net troubles get worked out o/
[2:33:48] <chris1sega> demo?
[2:33:57] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood do the evade towards the screen for you to have more time, because you are evading away from the kick
[2:33:57] <%Juicebox_FGC> 8 5 66, hold G. All in sequence, all fast. No delay on the 66! Lots of these aren't working because you aren't dashing in time. Keep at it! jbxSip
[2:33:59] <elementor374> @i_are_beedo Timezones are wierd
[2:33:59] <Snowkoi_> he's not evading the wrong way, those prompts are irrelevant
[2:34:04] <%krystalcute91> full game
[2:34:05] <%doodad_ounao> @mrmidlife @bananathebread At super high level it's almost as if this shit is the default side step that they do, it's mindbogling
[2:34:05] <+AyupaPupa> 4/5 lgwEnergy
[2:34:06] <%SHIN0BILI> try sidestepping the first move?
[2:34:08] <%Bloodninja15> Its about blocking an unevadeable
[2:34:10] <+starizu> Down Down Forward Forward G
[2:34:10] <Xcheaster> @bloodninja15 the game is specifically telling him to step toward the screen
[2:34:12] <EmperorVon> LUL LUL
[2:34:12] <The_Vulgar_Ape> what is the time for?
[2:34:14] <%inajefflymanner> move over frame date. time for VF date
[2:34:18] <rocketsinflight> I just did this tonight and it took me about 90 minutes. it was super frustrating
[2:34:19] <lazynormie> @chris1sega free with ps plus or ps now
[2:34:20] <%Bholorak> 33 G or 66 G
[2:34:22] <valokiteshvara> Chat he knows about the evade icons
[2:34:22] <ar2games> l think max figured out somthing better, just duck
[2:34:22] <ammobasket> Part 2 can't be stepped
[2:34:24] <Kobukson> hi juice hi tricky!
[2:34:25] <%MisterMukkey> Max, do you think this will be a FG you revisit from time to time like DBZ?
[2:34:26] <%Kage521> it must be the man bra i blame that
[2:34:26] <dgv88> You need to pay attention to the symbols over the dummy right, some you can't evade
[2:34:27] <OzLogWarTooth> @AfternoonConcession no this is tutorial training..
[2:34:28] <CommanderSqueaks> I want to go eat, but I don't want to miss you getting this. I am so hungry, so very hungry. T_T
[2:34:30] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood do the evade towards the screen for you to have more time, because you are evading away from the kick
[2:34:31] <kobura57> lol please VF bros tell him LUL
[2:34:33] <%SharpsPanda> I think you have more time if you down side dash . Kind of like how Tekken is
[2:34:34] <%MoonxLxght> super tight window
[2:34:34] <+timw2sleep> 3' to be exact
[2:34:38] <tamerlanethegreat> @OzLogWarTooth Sparring like this in real life would literally kill you.
[2:34:38] <Mormegil84> This game is so unelievably technical
[2:34:39] <%Tricky_vfdc> you have about i think 15 or so frames
[2:34:41] <doomorhope> its forward forward G that's the fast one yeah
[2:34:42] <%Brunty023> @Mattman162 Not really wrong way of evading. The prompts in Evasion-4 aren't relevant. Only doing the sidestep dash block cancel matters
[2:34:46] <%Vylent_> try 22 instead of 88?
[2:34:46] <+Xemitine > Xemitine  subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[2:34:49] <%Deezyfesheezy> @afternoonconcession Not really, this let's you block faster after a sidestep because you cancel it into a dash
[2:34:52] <%Kageromaru> @starizu Just 266 + G.  Not 2266.
[2:34:53] <kefka_himself> this like a parry of sorts
[2:34:56] <Leinharts> imagine doing this with multiplayer lag
[2:34:58] <%Tricky_vfdc> maybe 10
[2:34:58] <%Heavenleefatha> and don't things like this then become exponentially more difficult with a delay?
[2:35:01] <fgc_splash> I TOLD U MAX, 2 FRAME WINDOW claraaHeart
[2:35:03] <%Juicebox_FGC> dont wait for the step to start. input 8 66 all as one
[2:35:03] <%Tricky_vfdc> you have to buffer it
[2:35:04] <%MoonxLxght> jeez man LUL
[2:35:04] <$pap_possum> da xbox bone connected to da ps4 bone, da wiiu bones connected to da, you already know, da switch bone
[2:35:07] <%prisboy640> Been off for a few days, I’m guessing Max is enjoying VF
[2:35:11] <RocTager> 3 frames to wake up super a block. wow.
[2:35:13] <Immortal_Volkan> i think max is making it a lot harder by evading into the kick.
[2:35:15] <%RofflessLWK> My hands ache just from watching this doodInjury
[2:35:18] <randomlibrom> This must really wear people down
[2:35:19] <+nolifegamin> damn, no wonder it takes years to get gud at this game
[2:35:23] <DJ_is_Raiden> dont wait for the step to start. input 8 66 all as one!!!!!!!!!!
[2:35:24] <%Tricky_vfdc> like that1
[2:35:24] <%cheddajones92> that's crazy! doodCrazy
[2:35:30] <%heavyarms2050> watching this is giving my hand cramping already
[2:35:30] <OzLogWarTooth> @tamerlanethegreat no you just wouldn't be able to do it  for long before long term damage.
[2:35:34] <+GoombaPlus> yes....this looks like a fun video game
[2:35:35] <%Bazal68k> imaNoUse Jeebus
[2:35:38] <%FunnyCrimes> oh god yeah im doing this on hitbox i didnt even think about how hard itd be to do this with an actual stick lmao
[2:35:38] <%Bholorak> this basically lets you block a move that isnt sidestepable, but you already sidestepped
[2:35:39] <%Tricky_vfdc> @Juicebox_FGC knows the struggle
[2:35:44] <%steveman1991> How long has he been trying to get this evade timing down? monkaS
[2:35:48] <%Bazal68k> NICE
[2:35:48] <+Kairoem> Is he not allow to step those first two?
[2:35:49] <%BBboy20> :O
[2:35:49] <%Tetsuya5963> yoooooo
[2:35:49] <Xcheaster> @maximilian_dood   you’re meant to evade the initial hits on this one and THEN do the forward forward guard for the unreadable move after
[2:35:49] <%Aidonis> Nice one

[2:35:49] <%Tricky_vfdc> yes

[2:36:56] <%cheddajones92> @kefka_himself how to cheat
[2:36:57] <Lycus_Jhin_Grace> @Maximilian_DOOD have you tried other tutorials?
[2:36:58] <abhava0> sega!
[2:37:01] <%doodad_ounao> basically if you can do that every single sidestep, it might not help, but it won't get worse
[2:37:03] <Snowkoi_> I got this tutorial down but can't ever use it in a fight lol
[2:37:03] <+madmushroom64_> so you have to commit and cant just do it after you decide to just sidestep?

[2:37:56] <%Tetsuya5963> doodGood doodGood doodGood doodGood doodGood
[2:37:56] <CommanderSqueaks> So essentially, you're inputting the move hoping they're expecting you to dodge and throw out a circular attack.
[2:37:58] <%zane_dye> its easier now only with better matches..
[2:37:59] <chris1sega> changes the blocks strings setup for launchers @maximilian_dood
[2:38:01] <%Brunty023> @SHIN0BILI Yeah, the tutorial wants you to get hit by the two hits, then you sidestep dash block cancel the circular attack
[2:38:01] <%Juicebox_FGC> When you tap up or down, an Evade is a special thing that happens with some attacks. But with theses -circulars-, the Evade doesn't occur. So this is saying you can still guard... if you 66G very quickly.
[2:38:02] <%doodad_ounao> @bluestto Yep, I do all that shit til it's second nature. Go to a match and become a blob.

[2:40:20] <%zane_dye> @shinkuhadoken1 very true
[2:40:22] <@shinkuhadoken1> 5p, 2p, elbow, throw is literally all you need

[2:41:15] <%rktLunas> as much as i love these games, neutral is stupid hard to figure out
[2:41:16] <Jaku2011> All your charge moves are plus max
[2:41:16] <%Bazal68k> Real talk the front end menu is really cool. What a good idea.

[2:41:29] <EtherNigh> @maximilian_dood its amazing almost all the tech was intended by the dev instead of the player discoveries
[2:41:29] <doomorhope> i still find it crazy that this game has specific combos for specific characters
[2:41:29] <%Kageromaru> I love the built in Spectator mode in the Main menu!
[2:41:30] <@shinkuhadoken1> yeah don't do a high after :)

[2:41:35] <tamerlanethegreat> Why haven't fighting games become an academic field then?
[2:41:36] <ChaosImpact> People scream about balance all the time, but never play VF :(
[2:41:36] <+stormhowl_fgc> @maximilian_dood Half charge is also strong

[2:41:47] <%MadcatMK6> !glossary
[2:41:47] <@Nightbot> https://glossary.infil.net/?t= Fighting game lingo can be confusing. Just frames? DHC? OTG? What the hell is a Rekka!? Check out the incredible Fighting Game glossary made by Infil for more info
[2:41:48] <%Brunty023> @CHEETO_TAXES I accidentally did that one frame knee that I didn't realize I did it
[2:41:50] <zenith0111> @zhijoh Down punch
[2:41:52] <@shinkuhadoken1> u got plus enough to do a mid instead of 5p
[2:41:53] <tatsu00> Whenever I try charge moves with Jean I always get jabbed lol
[2:41:54] <+zzer0zz1> who won? :(
[2:41:56] <AfternoonConcession> isn't this the game that fuudo was known for before joining SF? @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:41:59] <%boredomaf> And now we'll  never know who won

[2:42:06] <Meranglemtur> yeah lion is cool but why does he get so much hate??
[2:42:11] <%Mattman162> oooh do a tournament
[2:42:12] <%Brogox> I like El Blaze but his cool stuff is pretty tough. Attack > stance > stance > attack.

[2:43:31] <%Brunty023> @VELVET9000 It's entirely up to however you want to play fighting games. Some just prefer the arcade feel with playing stcik
[2:43:35] <itzMelllo> How's the online chat?
[2:43:36] <OptimusCack> no di in this game
[2:43:39] <+SentientLag> If someone gets a ring out it lowers the cage for the next round, such a clever thing to do.
[2:43:41] <Vaxas96> dood nice skin it looks like max
[2:43:41] <%yeknomlive> isnt there? i thought i read there was in the tutorial
[2:43:44] <%krystalcute91> lol
[2:43:47] <hivehivehivehivehivehive> you should do the guard break grab combo more often
[2:43:47] <%mintmystic42> "And just one mistake is all it would take"  doodWat
[2:43:49] <%yeknomlive> maybe i read wrong
[2:43:51] <Synchroscheme> more of a SC thing

[2:43:52] <+Bariman98> The pressure...

[2:44:12] <OnTwitch_Hiding> I throw away Fightez im sorry. Nappa's in the game
[2:44:15] <qballgaymer> Are counters similar to DOA?
[2:44:16] <Wiiplayah43> @brogox it's not too bad compared to other characters
[2:44:19] <%krystalcute91> btw guys absrb netcode
[2:44:20] <Joebeezer> go for the ring out!
[2:44:21] <ghostofkombatjunkee> might be holdin onto block too long
[2:44:23] <zenith0111> @yeknomlive Theres different trch options but thats not DI
[2:44:26] <ar2games> @Wiiplayah43 yeah l guess you´re right
[2:44:27] <FluffyMcBear> Ride it out....
[2:44:30] <+SuperKokuJin916> Aoi is turning this into Fighting Vipers 3!
[2:44:31] <%BeatdownGG> @OmniSTylez I think it just comes as the rounds go along, he got 2 ring outs before they did
[2:44:31] <AfternoonConcession> jean really becomes a scrub killer if you let him charge attacks? @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:44:33] <tylovetx> you pissed her off.
[2:44:36] <jukebox2014> she is wild
[2:44:41] <Richter_Belm0nt> dunno, the rooms are somewhat broken. it happened to me more than once that the game froze once the host left a room. and i had to close the whole game.
[2:44:41] <i_are_beedo> catJAM
[2:44:43] <%Kage521> how convienient that max get the wall when hes about to be ringed out
[2:44:47] <%BeatdownGG> @OmniSTylez or they come out on the side they got out on LUL
[2:44:49] <%cheddajones92> push atpCap
[2:44:52] <%TheDo_DoGuy> I've had trouble figuring out my main and I finally figured it out I enjoy Jacky a lot for his quickness to doing combos
[2:44:52] <%zane_dye> uh oh. my son woke up gotta to go. Have Fun with VF chat and Max. <3
[2:44:53] <hivehivehivehivehivehive> that grab makes no sense
[2:44:54] <%Artsassin> Gentle push
[2:44:59] <Pursuit01> that is like the most gentile push
[2:45:00] <%MightySandwich> @qballgaymer Aoi’s counters kinda are
[2:45:00] <+NeoMasamune> Is there no way to have sidestep be 8+PKG?
[2:45:01] <kefka_himself> online for not so bueno, but i would say its better than tekken for me at least

[2:45:13] <%OmniSTylez> @BeatdownGG yeah i dont remember i just noticed after the last ring out
[2:45:14] <%cheddajones92> atpCap push
[2:45:15] <%Beardballs> i like how she gently rolls you over lol
[2:45:16] <%AlexTheHyenaVT> Is the ranking system the same or similar as Tekken?
[2:45:17] <%UltimateAzure> Used Aoi for a bit earlier, she's interesting. I'm willing to learn more of her
[2:45:22] <@shinkuhadoken1> nice step
[2:45:22] <+Kairoem> @zane_dye be well

[2:45:38] <%OmniSTylez> nice
[2:45:41] <DauragonLebrart> @maximilian_dood Would Vanessa be a good starting character?
[2:45:44] <%Juicebox_FGC> @AlexTheHyenaVT There are 10 Kyus, then 10 Dans, then 24 ranks, with the top being Skylord.
[2:45:44] <%PFlare> Another non-counter Aoi it seems like.
[2:45:45] <%Shadowdragon899> Notice a lot of people using Aoi, she must be good.
[2:45:48] <+Loliteku> The APM of this game scared me away instantly lmao. At least I can watch Max destroy people
[2:45:54] <OptimusCack> 66p+k is nice for messing with aoi counter stances
[2:45:55] <NongEther> she angy
[2:45:56] <libre__> that lucha libre dude is super interesting and fun to play
[2:45:56] <AfternoonConcession> does being on left or right make as big of a difference as it does in tekken? @Maximilian_DOOD

[2:46:09] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @DauragonLebrart Vanessa's a full blown stance character so probably not.

[2:46:45] <@shinkuhadoken1> the dan ranks right now are great for learning - tons of people made it into dans
[2:46:46] <%Shlobs> @Maximilian_DOOD thoughts on Brad? you ever play him before?

[2:47:24] <DauragonLebrart> @squiglybattleopera Stance like Siegfried of Soul Calibur?
[2:47:25] <@Viewtifulotaku7> I am using Aoi right now so I learned it's forward for that roll.

[2:47:53] <%GassyD> @zenith0111 Okay. I'll probably try with some simpler fighting games. I gave up on these games years ago, guess it's time I bring up some old ghosts LUL
[2:47:54] <%DarKaoZ> @maximilian_dood you can just hold PG and the direction too
[2:47:55] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @DauragonLebrart More like Gen from Street Fighter. Two entirely different characters in one.
[2:47:56] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @qballgaymer Foroward/Backward/Neutral + Throw for the throw the opponent is using.
[2:47:57] <%MadcatMK6> They're literally combo breakers.
[2:48:06] <hivehivehivehivehivehive> @Maximilian_DOOD you gotta do the guard break throw combo
[2:48:06] <kobura57> Max is finally a VF head Kappa
[2:48:07] <Meranglemtur> @maximilian_dood pretty sure you unlocked new costumes for jean
[2:48:08] <%Juicebox_FGC> @Maximilian_DOOD The Aoi tumble can be either front or back break. It leads to a -chain throw-, with each of the chain steps breakable with 8P+G or 2P+G! (The very rare up/down break)
[2:48:11] <azizalasfour1> You enjoying the game max!
[2:48:12] <@shinkuhadoken1> awe
[2:48:15] <%latin_godura> sorry for the late question, but can you invite people on lobbies?

[2:48:40] <%PFlare> @Shadowdragon899 Game's been out for literal years. This is just a remastered rerelease.
[2:48:41] <EtherNigh> Sarah martial arts is martial arts LUL
[2:48:41] <Snesboxlive> Kreygasm
[2:48:42] <zenith0111> @gassyd Even the more complex games like Tekken or Guilty Gear have notoriously cheesy characters for being easy to master
[2:48:44] <%sae_what> BOO THAT MAN
[2:48:45] <ghostofkombatjunkee> how do they look bad? lol

[2:48:48] <%GassyD> @DosPalmas I can't even win against weak AI opponents, let alone the demons online. Give me an RPG and I'll theorycraft myself to absolute OPness or a shooter and I ... won't suck. But fighting games ... they're just hard LUL

[2:48:54] <%TokenBlackDood> GET SHOT
[2:48:55] <+stormhowl_fgc> @x_art_of_life_x It's a 3d fg  with rules that actually make sense and isn't full of exceptions
[2:48:55] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Person still gets shot for that.
[2:48:56] <dany0tom> @x_art_of_life_x if tekken 7 is the CoD black ops of fighting games then VF5 is MW2
[2:48:56] <MemoryOfTheBody> @hydratedperson690 come back when you know what you're talking about
[2:48:57] <lordlord07> probably a NRS fan Kappa
[2:48:57] <%OgGeek2016> Must be a Tekken player
[2:48:57] <qballgaymer> The animations are the most realistic of any fighter I've ever seen
[2:48:59] <+lPako> Are you playing this on ps5 @maximilian_dood
[2:49:00] <%TootenTV> It looks fucking GREAT. I just can't deal with the netcode
[2:49:02] <TucsonKaHN> Jean looks like Kadaj from Advent Children.....
[2:49:02] <@shinkuhadoken1> deserved @Viewtifulotaku7
[2:49:03] <%latin_godura> ok, it's not just me @thatdudetz thanks doodBro
[2:49:04] <%retrozaid> shotoPew
[2:49:04] <holeecrab> i heard asuka from WWE do the mocap for this
[2:49:05] <palpatineselectricbill> Auska!
[2:49:06] <Jirojairokai> We found the Tekken fanboy Kappa
[2:49:07] <nazirr_> This looks bad? Then what is good compared to this?
[2:49:07] <+soulbro412> they don't look cool ether way
[2:49:07] <$Darshiro> Looking forward to more customizable goodies.
[2:49:08] <%ilyk3urface> doodNoThx
[2:49:08] <%dethsycthe> Sarah is best Bryant
[2:49:08] <Meranglemtur> @shlobs  currently for PS4 and I think Xbox one with backwards compatibility
[2:49:08] <%Onyx_13k> If this looks bad what looks good for that dood? lol
[2:49:09] <%TheOGB> could you imagine Kappa
[2:49:10] <%TheWood82> I don't know why I don't like Sarah's idle stance.
[2:49:11] <%BananaTheBread> @Fruit_Punch_Ronin shamwowing the delay LUL
[2:49:12] <%Cgame_me811> Wifu doodThirst doodSweet
[2:49:12] <+nolifegamin> that guy's eyes probably only process fps at 30 frames per second LUL
[2:49:12] <@shinkuhadoken1> reload
[2:49:13] <Camaleonte07> Then you have Wolf who 50% of his moves are throws LUL
[2:49:15] <%TheWood82> She did!
[2:49:16] <+RobinFoDays> what are the dans
[2:49:16] <1881eagle> does sarah have her juggle like in doa5 or now
[2:49:16] <arccun> animations are so dope in this, wolf/el blaze especially
[2:49:17] <%The_Vengeful> This & DOA have the best animations I can think of
[2:49:17] <%doodad_ounao> @x_art_of_life_x no specials, no crazy powers, no super easy infinite combos. Spatial awareness and quick reflexes/quick thinking is more important than a lot of other FGs. Though I'm not super expert either
[2:49:19] <Norbiej> cant have an opinion in this chat guys Kappa
[2:49:19] <%nenjutsutv> Lmao
[2:49:20] <AfternoonConcession> what mechanic do you think should be added to a future VF? @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:49:20] <Andrako> LUL
[2:49:21] <hydratedperson690> @elementor374 yeah, tekken 5 had better animations than this
[2:49:22] <%quique_schz> @Viewtifulotaku7 doodTerror  he had a family!
[2:49:22] <kheyki> don't shoot just bonk LUL LUL
[2:49:22] <boydaussen> animations look great, the characters however...
[2:49:26] <hollysephiroth> its not animation but total lack of hitsparks
[2:49:26] <%TheWood82> She's "Kana" in the credits.
[2:49:26] <%Artsassin> Probably think Street fighter 5 has better animation lmao
[2:49:27] <%wizchiefa23> Ppl having mixed feelings just play some fighting games
[2:49:27] <reepusart> in general the game does not fill screen whether in main menu or in game. But when I dashboard the ps4 menu still fills the screen
[2:49:28] <dgv88> I am curios what games he plays LUL
[2:49:30] <%Frizen_101> Says animations look bad and then goes and plays Mortal Kombat Kappa
[2:49:31] <%Cgame_me811> @dethsycthe doodGood
[2:49:32] <DauragonLebrart> @squiglybattleopera Interesting... And I would be blind (and stupid) to say I didn’t noticed that while doing her command training. So far I am enjoying her!
[2:49:32] <%sae_what> He's watching on his Leapfrog Kids tablet Kappa
[2:49:34] <OkamiDude15> @holeecrab yeah she did the mocap for jessica iirc.
[2:49:34] <thatdudetz> @latin_godura no problem👽
[2:49:34] <%GutsyJoker> Lmaoo
[2:49:35] <%Dakuu75> I hate sand... it's rough and course and gets everywhere.
[2:49:35] <+zzer0zz1> can't wait for halloween dlc Kreygasm
[2:49:36] <Wiiplayah43> anyone who thinks the animations are bad need to get their eyes checked
[2:49:38] <sharonra> I want to play Pai but man I feel like she might be too much trouble for a newbie like me
[2:49:39] <@shinkuhadoken1> that's full circular so u can't step it, but you can jump over it :)
[2:49:40] <+rafus1> there's a lot of legacy animations that look really bad
[2:49:43] <surft> Tekken uses the camera angles/ cuts well, to have this air of coolness
[2:49:47] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @RobinFoDays It's your rank. Kinda like real; martial arts.
[2:49:48] <+SuperKokuJin916> Sarah...SAAARAH! No time is a good time for goodbyyyye! WutFace
[2:49:48] <BlackMask42080> now this is oldschool
[2:49:50] <%Beardballs> down jab is like dp, it just says no
[2:49:52] <%cheddajones92> @holeecrab I dont think so this game came out way before Asuka was for WWE.
[2:49:52] <%TheWood82> I'm really glad they added the hit sparks in this version.
[2:49:54] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Alright, chat. You don't need to dogpile on the person. lytWIPED
[2:49:55] <%Tesseract24> sarah Kreygasm
[2:49:55] <%krystalcute91> parry max
[2:49:57] <@shinkuhadoken1> this sarah aint bad at all
[2:49:57] <%PFlare> @sharonra Pai is actually really newbie friendly.
[2:50:02] <Crippl3> is VF a 4 button game?
[2:50:04] <%wizchiefa23> This is literally one of the most realistic animations ever made
[2:50:05] <chris1sega> Parry
[2:50:07] <@shinkuhadoken1> parryings actrually pretty hard @krystalcute91  heh
[2:50:09] <zenith0111> I love the sound effect. Everything is so distinct from one another
[2:50:11] <%qtgothwaifu> !glossary Meaty
[2:50:11] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Crippl3 3
[2:50:11] <@Nightbot> https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Meaty Fighting game lingo can be confusing. Just frames? DHC? OTG? What the hell is a Rekka!? Check out the incredible Fighting Game glossary made by Infil for more info
[2:50:12] <+Katmon27> yea it looks like tekken 7 but i think tekken is better visually
[2:50:13] <+dpozner> @sharonra she's actually relatively easy to pick up. just focus on a few combo strings
[2:50:13] <@shinkuhadoken1> @Crippl3 3
[2:50:13] <%Frizen_101> @hollysephiroth but there are literally hitsparks right there
[2:50:14] <Bankainojutso> I don't know why, but Jean remember me Genesis xD
[2:50:14] <%HazeKasumi> @maximilian_dood What would be a good starter character for this game?
[2:50:16] <%Brunty023> @holeecrab Yeah, Asuka did mocap for Vanessa. She went by Kana at the time
[2:50:17] <%AlexTheHyenaVT> @maximilian_dood when’s your Vtuber debut with the Virtua Fighter model LUL
[2:50:18] <tylovetx> did you main Jean in 2007?
[2:50:19] <ar2games> the wall throws are incredible
[2:50:19] <%Fuukoji> @Maximilian_DOOD If you press start when setting the audio to VF2 you can get VF Kids
[2:50:20] <%ryokupo> @Crippl3 3
[2:50:22] <elementor374> @viewtifulotaku7 But you shot him Kappa

[2:50:24] <palpatineselectricbill> @cheddajones92 She literally said she did on her twitter
[2:50:25] <$shwez> nice streak
[2:50:25] <hydratedperson690> @dgv88 I play tekken
[2:50:29] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @DauragonLebrart Well if you're enjoying her and don't mind how complex she is, then go for it man. She's sick as fuck.
[2:50:29] <EtherNigh> SHAAAA
[2:50:29] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @tylovetx He did not.
[2:50:32] <Fruit_Punch_Ronin> max how's the online?
[2:50:33] <%Man_in_the_Red> @crippl3 3 button actually, but that PK macro will get a lot of use on some characters
[2:50:34] <%TheOGB> @RobinFoDays ranking. starts 10 kyu goes up to 1st kyu, then 1st dan. 1st dan goes to like 5th dan?? not sure, but it's online rank
[2:50:35] <x_art_of_life_x> @stormhowl_fgc @dany0tom @doodad_ounao Thanks so much, guys! <3 I'll have to look deeper into it when I download it
[2:50:35] <+jblossom> bring back bloody roar @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:50:39] <%OmniSTylez> lets go!
[2:50:41] <sharonra> @PFlare oh really? right on then - I'd rather deal with newbie friendly than some hard shit LUL
[2:50:42] <Wiiplayah43> @hydratedperson690 there's no tekken with better animations than this, you're clearly a fanboy
[2:50:47] <Meranglemtur> online is better than Tekken though
[2:50:47] <@shinkuhadoken1> rank up sound as loud as Sol's gunflame from +R
[2:50:47] <%PFlare> It is!
[2:50:51] <MimicTheDragon> SourPls
[2:50:53] <+nolifegamin> tekken has more flashy/over-the-top animations, I think people usually prefer that over more realistic animations
[2:50:53] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @elementor374 Doesn't mean to insult him like some of chat is doing.
[2:50:54] <%Bloodninja15> Jean was in og VF5
[2:50:58] <qballgaymer> What is the parry system like?
[2:50:59] <%Bloodninja15> Wasnt
[2:51:00] <%Kalzassa> @VELVET9000 lots of people commonly recommend either Jacky or Sarah for starter.
[2:51:01] <%doodad_ounao> @x_art_of_life_x doodBro doodBro
[2:51:01] <BlackMask42080> I remember pumping a shit load of quarter's in the arcades
[2:51:02] <%wizchiefa23> knowkamiPain where’s my cape
[2:51:05] <%Juicebox_FGC> @TheOGB There are 10 Dans. After that are named ranks (24 of them)
[2:51:09] <+NeoMasamune> some people confuse art style for animation
[2:51:11] <%cheddajones92> @palpatineselectricbill you mean new animations? when she was for WWE or old animations for NJPW?
[2:51:13] <%sholeeyuken> Sarah is also a great  beginner character
[2:51:14] <%steveman1991> @shinkuhadoken1 This game is loud period! LUL
[2:51:24] <@Viewtifulotaku7> 12021
[2:51:24] <+AverageBananas12> I love how the sand picks up whenever you kick
[2:51:29] <%Cgame_me811> Sarah in her black dress doodSweet doodSweet doodSweet
[2:51:30] <Snesboxlive> atpOro
[2:51:31] <hydratedperson690> @Wiiplayah43 this looks super sluggish to me and looks like the moves stop before actually hitting the other player
[2:51:32] <+Siosefa> @neomasamune that's what i thought he meant
[2:51:33] <%PFlare> @cheddajones92 Back when she was still NJPW.
[2:51:39] <%qtgothwaifu> wow and we thought strive had high dmg, this is is wild
[2:51:42] <elementor374> @viewtifulotaku7 Well, i guess you're right
[2:51:42] <sharonra> I guess this game really is that fucking hard man... how the fuck do I pick the newbie friendly character and still feel like shit LUL
[2:51:43] <@shinkuhadoken1> @Juicebox_FGC net still trash?
[2:51:45] <%Frizen_101> What even is Sarah's fighting style
[2:51:48] <%ryokupo> @Crippl3 The controls for VF are basically DOA2-5 but without the throw button. So the same as DOA1 if you've ever played that.
[2:51:49] <+stormhowl_fgc> @tricky_vfdc who are good Brad players?
[2:51:50] <%SeanmanderPlays> @Maximilian_DOOD Where do you get more costumes in this game?
[2:51:50] <%FishTacosTonite> I turned the audio down to 1 whenever I play VF5
[2:51:52] <%TheOGB> @Juicebox_FGC ah, got it
[2:51:52] <+zzer0zz1> PogChamp
[2:51:53] <%NurseLee> @qballgaymer it's character specfic, and it all varies on the attack; such as, mid, lows, kick, punch, elbows, and etc.
[2:51:54] <%HazeKasumi> @kalzassa Thank you. doodGood
[2:51:54] <kheyki> PogChamp PogChamp
[2:51:55] <%Kage521> how does that hit
[2:51:55] <DNICE3838> this made big esports fighting game i heard
[2:51:56] <AfternoonConcession> when a game is delayed like KOF does it usually mean more content will come of it or higher quality of what was expected? @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:51:59] <%Juicebox_FGC> yes shinku :(
[2:52:00] <%TheWood82> Sarah's a kickboxer.
[2:52:00] <ChaosImpact> STAY DOWN
[2:52:02] <Nayafer91> soo sick dood!!!
[2:52:02] <%PFlare> @Frizen_101 Stylized kickboxing, IIRC.
[2:52:02] <%krystalcute91> 4th dan
[2:52:02] <%BeatdownGG> @qtgothwaifu How VF has always been
[2:52:03] <dgv88> @hydratedperson690 i play a lot of Tekken too, and i actually think the animations look great , don't know what to say to you
[2:52:04] <lord_dragox412> D:
[2:52:08] <%steveman1991> Taka-Arashi's slaps sound so goddamn load in this game it's insane.

[2:52:10] <kefka_himself> i cant really say which one is better because they are so different, would have to say both are good in their respective ways
[2:52:12] <Morimoriforest> idk about animation or graphics but the sound of them blocking is definitely the worst of all fighting game i've heard so far. it's like the sound of you knocking metallic object on your car lol
[2:52:13] <+GohthePandog> Ah. F2P model. Lol
[2:52:14] <%MoonxLxght> they need more options!!
[2:52:18] <%ryokupo> That's fine since this is a $20/free game
[2:52:19] <+GrooVyB_7> GG's. still super new to the game :D
[2:52:19] <MemoryOfTheBody> @hydratedperson690 you should get your eyes checked cause that's not consistent with what's happening on screen lol
[2:52:20] <Wiiplayah43> spinny jump lmao
[2:52:20] <%Kalzassa> @VELVET9000 happythoPat
[2:52:20] <DSD24> I think the game says Sarah style is Martial Arts
[2:52:20] <+SP_Patrick> The DLC pack is anemic. Sega needs to go absolutely mad with customization options.
[2:52:21] <%TheOGB> @Frizen_101 mixed martial arts
[2:52:22] <+Delighted_Demon> @Frizen_101  it's TKD mixed with others,  so mma
[2:52:22] <rellik7986> NotLikeThis
[2:52:22] <idrisstekken> tekken i way harder
[2:52:23] <RocTager> So no earned customization?
[2:52:24] <EtherNigh> @frizen_101 probably mix of many martial arts

[2:52:35] <%PseuDEEnym> theyre both good
[2:52:36] <%PFlare> THE WAR COMES BACK
[2:52:36] <Mirakei> When you throw do you get to decide which way your opponent is supposed to tech or is it based on the throw itself
[2:52:37] <tacticalnuke002> Sarah is MMA

[2:52:54] <%Jflaskd13> I just like the character design in Tekken better. Both are good @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:52:54] <Meranglemtur> yup since the 90s but the reality of Tekken is that it was developed by ex virtua Fighter Devs right
[2:52:54] <%Shadowdragon899> CoolStoryBob Just play what you like chat
[2:52:54] <%doodad_ounao> Better is suuuper subjective, but there's no way in hell that Tekken is harder
[2:52:54] <%sae_what> SHINKU monkaS
[2:52:55] <Soul_Vanisher> Why not enjoy both?

[2:52:58] <%Ciferia> Tekken made by ex Sega employees nuff said
[2:52:58] <%dethsycthe> VF2 in the 90s was crazy
[2:52:59] <%inajefflymanner> it doesnt matter. One isn't better than the other. They both exist and it's great entertainment
[2:52:59] <Omortus> Both games suck :)
[2:52:59] <alexthrashbig4_> tekken characters are better , animation goes for vf
[2:52:59] <%boredomaf> who cares
[2:53:00] <$xwar1209> @GohthePandog its always been like that since 06. lol

[2:53:02] <%Brunty023> HERE WE GO!
[2:53:02] <%MoonxLxght> the more generations change the more they stay the same
[2:53:02] <%memburberry> it's like it's engrained in people to tribe up on this stuff
[2:53:03] <%ubermensch1033> true, but it's clear as day Tekken far surpassed VF
[2:53:03] <Crippl3> @shinkuhadoken1 good luck
[2:53:03] <%OgGeek2016> had
[2:53:03] <%DragonRusch> Fighters Mega Mix is better than Smash!

[2:53:08] <+RiceKeiku> lol yea just play and enjoy what you like and stop seeking validation for your preference
[2:53:09] <dlpheonix> 1997 tekken vs vf conversation
[2:53:10] <SirYamms> First Soldier is finally available
[2:53:12] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Akira players are scientifically proven to have bigger genitals than every other member of their race.
[2:53:12] <kefka_himself> toshinden FTW
[2:53:12] <$shwez> that mullet
[2:53:12] <%CaneWanderer> You should play whatever you feel like, now suck it! D:
[2:53:13] <surft> VF is a lot more technical, and that alienated a lot of people
[2:53:13] <%TheWood82> I'm actually shocked how good the connections have been so far.
[2:53:14] <%sae_what> SHIN AKIRA monkaS
[2:53:15] <DNICE3838> dlc worth it tho max
[2:53:15] <%DinoPulseZeta> @Maximilian_DOOD You're forgetting Street Fighter
[2:53:16] <%FishTacosTonite> yah
[2:53:17] <%wizchiefa23> Honest tekken vf and doa were all alike to me n I love them all as 3D fighters
[2:53:20] <jdp_9> @maximilian_dood A whole new generation of fighters now get to argue what we did
[2:53:20] <%Resident_Stevil> Guys please...clearly Battle Arena Toshiden is better Kappa
[2:53:20] <%Tricky_vfdc> what is this akira! where is the monke
[2:53:24] <%ryokupo> @kungfooTitan That's my corner FeelsGoodMan
[2:53:24] <+Siosefa> I mean, this argument has been stuck in the gutter for too long so it makes sense that it's resurfacing LUL
[2:53:25] <%Fuukoji> @DragonRusch Yes
[2:53:26] <%PseuDEEnym> tekken is more fantasy. this is more sim
[2:53:26] <%Setsunin> There's a lot of Virtua Biters in this chat tonight.
[2:53:26] <%Otoshi_Gami> @Maximilian_DOOD yeah Tekken has Plenty of ROSTER to choose from
[2:53:28] <+Kairoem> Dude that blue trail on the wrist is sick
[2:53:29] <+NeoMasamune> It helped that Tekken had cool ending movies. Story was super sparse for VF series
[2:53:29] <evilharryz> Console wars died since PS4 and Xbox One came out.. now its just give money and ill throw you a PC bugged game
[2:53:29] <+aroo27> people just get really defensive about what they've poured hundreds of hours into
[2:53:30] <%Cgame_me811> doodStare doodStare doodStare doodStare
[2:53:31] <%steveman1991> Both games are great you guys.
[2:53:33] <kobura57> I prefer VF roster 1000x lol
[2:53:33] <%Artsassin> VF vs Tekken game would be sick
[2:53:35] <ar2games> tekken is more fun because l can actually win lol
[2:53:35] <tjay714> tekken is scrubby compared to this
[2:53:36] <Wiiplayah43> got ads the moment the moment max started talking about tekken, fml
[2:53:36] <%blakninja89> Both are great games
[2:53:36] <%Otoshi_Gami> @Maximilian_DOOD while VF5 roster is lesser
[2:53:37] <ferbeholds> i dont like many tekken character designs
[2:53:37] <@NYCrownlessKing> you ask max like every month to play tekken. how about just be quiet or engage in chat rather complain bout VF @hydratedperson690
[2:53:38] <+SP_Patrick> Has anyone else run into that Goh that's just been queuing up idle for matches all night?
[2:53:38] <%OneTimeEscapeArtist> I hated Tekken lore when I was younger
[2:53:39] <%doodad_ounao> Tekken 3 was my childhood in a nutshell
[2:53:39] <fgc_splash> NAH, I LOVE VF CHARACTERS claraaHeart
[2:53:40] <+Bravetriforcer> Feels like most of VF's characters are just "Some Guy"
[2:53:40] <%Cyferknight> @Maximilian_DOOD when are we getting the tekken virtual figther cross over
[2:53:41] <%Man_in_the_Red> @resident_stevil no, Ergheiz is the best
[2:53:42] <%OmniSTylez> lets go akira dood!
[2:53:43] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Different styles of games.
[2:53:44] <Flopping28> DOA and SC like...
[2:53:44] <+Taisuru> Has max ever gotten scrubquotes sent his way after matches?
[2:53:46] <%NurseLee> at least VF has a tutorial mode for their games. Looking at you Tekken. LUL
[2:53:46] <+yaboidustyy> why debate about this when  you can like both PokCroagunk
[2:53:47] <%JRRRIP> VF is not a sim lol
[2:53:49] <%TheWood82> I just hope VF and Tekken have fun today.
[2:53:49] <pinkylolislit> KoF was way better than SF back then too
[2:53:54] <%OmniSTylez> sorry max but i root for akira users
[2:53:55] <%Kalzassa> It's a matter of opinion or preference on what you prefer. I personally like DOA better than either of them. Play what you enjoy and have the most fun with prettymuch. mrbrunComfy
[2:53:57] <qballgaymer> Tekken 3 seemed "cooler", but I just didn't have access to VF
[2:54:00] <+RunoEddie> it's like the wars never ended, so weird
[2:54:03] <TerrorRISK> SF's competition was KOF and KI back then.
[2:54:04] <%DragonRusch> @DragonRusch Oh yeah!
[2:54:04] <%gbeat240> Which ever series brings rollback first, will be the clear 3D fighter winner
[2:54:04] <+pick_me_up_Nerd> ooooohh
[2:54:05] <drhivesphd> @shinkuhadoken1 vs @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:54:06] <%zefitz> Tekken 7 almost has as many characters as Tag2 and that's without copy characters
[2:54:06] <+soulbro412> That's my biggest issue with VF the characters really look bland
[2:54:06] <elementor374> @yaboidustyy Facts
[2:54:10] <Sigilstar> a tale of fists and fights forever retold
[2:54:10] <%GaryGoodJob> Whooooa threeee deeeeee
[2:54:14] <%Crim1223> DOA best 3d fighter
[2:54:16] <%MrMidLife> Akira doing his Fatal Fury Cosplay lol
[2:54:18] <AfternoonConcession> i like the mechanics in VF, i hope i get the chance to play it if it comes to PC
[2:54:18] <%dragonsworn3g3t3> who cares anyway everyone should just enjoy the sandwich they're eating and not worry about other sandwiches
[2:54:20] <%OmniSTylez> damn this guys ok
[2:54:21] <DNICE3838> this game will hurt doa tho
[2:54:21] <%PFlare> DID HE JUST ONE FRAME?!

[2:54:22] <%DinoPulseZeta> @Maximilian_DOOD BTW, If there's any character I could say is a unique alternative to what you had to Tekken, I'd say Jeffry comes to mind.
[2:54:22] <surft> The Anime series for VF is better than the Tekken one
[2:54:23] <abelharker> Akira's scare me dood
[2:54:24] <%MegaDyne> Ceasefire is over
[2:54:28] <+zzer0zz1> Let him win BibleThump
[2:54:28] <kefka_himself> CRITICOM Probably the best
[2:54:28] <Fullfatnog> Lei Fei is the scrub go to
[2:54:29] <JarJarSpank> clearly mk deadly alliance is the best 3d fighter Kappa
[2:54:31] <%wizchiefa23> Yo he was beating that ass for a second
[2:54:32] <+SuperKokuJin916> Virtua Fighter 2 came out in 94. Think about that. It looked better than Tekken Tag 1. It's aged better too.
[2:54:32] <Meranglemtur> Im new to VF and I play Tekken mostly but I do love VF 5 FS it's fun
[2:54:32] <+Siosefa> Be like me chat, cool for liking both games m0xyG

[2:54:33] <mariosonicboss> bloody roar fellas
[2:54:33] <@Viewtifulotaku7> In that 10 people club of liking DoA more.
[2:54:34] <evilharryz> Tekken has more charismatic tier and VF is damn skilled based that makes you feel like a pro when you achive mid tier ish lvl.
[2:54:34] <%DinoPulseZeta> @soulbro412 bland until you see Jeffry.
[2:54:35] <%Shlobs> Tekken is more anime like and VF i feel is more grounded in reality
[2:54:36] <%ryokupo> @Crim1223 doodBro My man
[2:54:37] <%Man_in_the_Red> @dragonsworn3g3t3 no mine's better
[2:54:38] <%boredomaf> Did SimCity have competition with Virtua Fighter? @maximilian_dood
[2:54:39] <%OmniSTylez> classic bread n butter
[2:54:40] <+GutsofTeal> yah I think vf plays too much different from tekken to compare them
[2:54:42] <+TempestAri> @MrMidLife now that would be a crossover
[2:54:42] <%TheWood82> True, but Tekken 7 has been in active development for 7 years straight.
[2:54:42] <hobotech64> vf is real.  tekken is hokey.
[2:54:42] <Eddalot> Yea the characters in this doesn't seem like its strong-point. Looks fun though.
[2:54:45] <+Taisuru> GOD I LOVE VIRTUA FIGHTER
[2:54:47] <%hoernchenspielt> Trows dealing a lot of dmg or does it just seem so?
[2:54:51] <DSD24> I miss bloody riar
[2:54:54] <%Cgame_me811> Even though doa has more in common with VF
[2:54:57] <jerry4050> Didn't the original VF creator left and made Tekken 2
[2:54:58] <%buff_riku_says> Chat, what defines a good move in this game? I've been tryna play Lau and nothing feels good

[2:55:01] <%Man_in_the_Red> @siosefa Average 3D fighter Enjoyer fftbgBigBrain
[2:55:02] <@shinkuhadoken1> clutched mah akira
[2:55:04] <hassanjabari1> was VF at any point more popular than street fighter when it was the first 3D fighting game?
[2:55:04] <+Katmon27> i feel like its just good discussion cuz they both seem to be upping their game everytime so its nice
[2:55:04] <%Adwark> @shinkuhadoken1 Eileen User? shotoImpress
[2:55:04] <Jaku2011> I preffer DOA too there are DOZENS of us
[2:55:05] <%Weevensteven> damn
[2:55:07] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @hoernchenspielt Throws always dealt good damag in VF
[2:55:08] <%sae_what> He's sandbagging Kappa
[2:55:08] <ChaosImpact> that Akira combo was SICK
[2:55:09] <zenith0111> @hoernchenspielt VF just has damage everywhere
[2:55:11] <+dpozner> @hoernchenspielt tbh everything deals a lot of damage
[2:55:12] <@Viewtifulotaku7> damage*
[2:55:13] <%TheWood82> Dude, yeah
[2:55:13] <%OmniSTylez> iut looks amazing
[2:55:15] <%OmniSTylez> like art
[2:55:15] <ankit_hitman> gg
[2:55:18] <AfternoonConcession> does this game have the same D1 problem as MK11? or is it completely different? @Maximilian_DOOD
[2:55:18] <gremoryy> i dont have access to VF nor Tekken so i grew up with 2D fighting games like SF and Samsho so i dont think i like 3D FG that much
[2:55:19] <@shinkuhadoken1> so fast
[2:55:25] <%Cgame_me811> @shlobs Pretty much
[2:55:27] <%Capt_Blakhelm> Tekken is hokey?! doodHokey
[2:55:27] <OptimusCack> vf needs rollback so badly
[2:55:28] <+sol_badguy27> The only 2D game that tried to compete with VF and Tekken was Art of Fighting 3.
[2:55:29] <nazirr_> this game needs rollback
[2:55:32] <+Siosefa> @man_in_the_red HOLY m0xyBased
[2:55:34] <evilharryz> Chat WE should be thankful we have A LOT of fighting game options today.....
[2:55:35] <%DragonRusch> Just picked up a copy of VF Remix on Saturn!
[2:55:37] <tanarath> Does tekkem have rollback?
[2:55:40] <%gbeat240> I’ve legit always wanted to play VF5 because of El Blaze, used to be a big Rey Mysterio fan as a kid
[2:55:40] <kobura57> It needs region option !!!!
[2:55:41] <idrisstekken> virtua fighter is harder than street fighter ?
[2:55:44] <%iamtherook> It's super clean, which is a nice change
[2:55:46] <%OmniSTylez> ooooooo
[2:55:47] <%Juicebox_FGC> VF5 is "3 mistakes = round" The Game. Except walls/ring outs sometimes make it 1 or 2 mistakes instead.
[2:55:47] <%PFlare> Was that ANOTHER one frame?
[2:55:47] <Fullfatnog> ???? haven't felt lag at all so far
[2:55:49] <Flopping28> VF don't have memorable characters unfortunately BibleThump
[2:55:49] <%OmniSTylez> spicy
[2:55:50] <%TheWood82> I do appreciate how they've worked around the delay netcode, and might be a lesson learned down the line.
[2:55:53] <hivehivehivehivehivehive> id play jean if he didnt look so weird
[2:55:54] <BlackMask42080> so what about DOA🤔
[2:56:00] <dgv88> That's the story with almost every delay based game  LUL
[2:56:01] <+arcadus07> what's d1?
[2:56:01] <Qsmash_> tekken is 3
[2:56:02] <Sonexay> I’d be nervous anyone playing Akira online cause you know they know some ish
[2:56:08] <+adamcolebaybay37> i love that the matches are quicker in vf
[2:56:10] <@Viewtifulotaku7> "VF doesn't have memorable characters sadly" lytFILTH
[2:56:12] <%TheWood82> man, you kidding?  Jackie is super memerable.
[2:56:13] <%linne_inverse> them one frame knees doodCrazy doodCrazy doodCrazy doodCrazy
[2:56:14] <@Viewtifulotaku7> And I took that personally.
[2:56:15] <%NurseLee> @tanarath it has rollback, But it's not "Rollback Netcode" according to Harada....
[2:56:16] <%GassyD> Damn that flip kick hits HARD PogChamp
[2:56:16] <%OneTimeEscapeArtist> Games with the better ques are always more fun
[2:56:18] <%doodad_ounao> @arcadus07 day 1
[2:56:19] <%buff_riku_says> @idrisstekken Impossible to compare. You're talking about a 2D game when this is 3D. Entirely different skillsset
[2:56:19] <+elmerstvs> are they fighting on the moon or something
[2:56:20] <kefka_himself> capcom and arika need to tight their pants and make a new street figher ex
[2:56:20] <%OmniSTylez> LUL
[2:56:20] <%TheWood82> Hell, him and Sarah showed up in DOA.
[2:56:21] <rance_zero> d1 = first day
[2:56:24] <%PFlare> PUNCHED
[2:56:27] <%DarKaoZ> and that's why Akira is OP, combos out of throws XD
[2:56:29] <%DodgyMealPrep> That stick waggle animation is adorable
[2:56:31] <Wiiplayah43> @idrisstekken you're literally comparing the easiest & hardest fighting games. VF is TONS harder
[2:56:31] <%FishTacosTonite> Down 1 @arcadus07
[2:56:32] <Nayafer91> nice
[2:56:32] <+GutsofTeal> doa kind of went down hill the more that made
[2:56:32] <Meranglemtur> let's be real .   majority of us played DOA for the assets lol
[2:56:33] <txcforever> What VF always lacked. Presentation, a story, characters being a bit generic, lack of spectacle. Reason why it stopped being a mainstream fighter after the Saturn.
[2:56:34] <abelharker> @Viewtifulotaku7 LUL LUL LUL
[2:56:37] <%OmniSTylez> WHOA
[2:56:39] <%PFlare> YOO

[2:56:49] <+SuperKokuJin916> VF and DOA are kissing cousins. Sarah, Akira, Jacky & Pai all made it in DOA5.
[2:56:49] <%Otoshi_Gami> LUL
[2:56:49] <%Weevensteven> safe
[2:56:51] <%ryokupo> @jerry4050 No. Suzuki stayed with SEGA until 2010.
[2:56:54] <$akitsuki_> seeing this game is so odd to me. the sounds and UI both look about 15 years outdated. partly because the sound IS, but i really hate how that UI looks lmao
[2:56:55] <%krystalcute91> doodLUL
[2:56:55] <OptimusCack> lol the jump over oki tetsuzanko. classic
[2:56:56] <%OmniSTylez> ok this akira is losing steam
[2:56:57] <%RofflessLWK> Sarah and Akira are memorable, imo
[2:56:59] <Eddalot> Shinku is a paid actor.
[2:57:01] <%FishTacosTonite> @arcadus07 crouching punch is d1
[2:57:03] <%steveman1991> Wolf Hawkfield was made into a literal pro wrestler for Christ's sake! LUL
[2:57:05] <Kobukson> that looked like a jackie chan movie
[2:57:05] <BlackMask42080> DOA6 is still pretty fun..just my opinion 🤷♂️
[2:57:10] <@shinkuhadoken1> kthis man breakin@askldfjas;lfj
[2:57:10] <TempestEvolution> I think the most memorable VF characters are Akira, Pai-Chan, Jacky and Sarah and Kage-Maru
[2:57:12] <%doodad_ounao> @elicnocer Yoo doodBro
[2:57:13] <kobura57> VF characters are totally iconic

[2:57:27] <@shinkuhadoken1> yes lets

[3:07:30] <%JuniperWizardHasan> Max has evolved so much in like two days, and I can’t even block properly in this game lol
[3:07:31] <unknlai> @shinkuhadoken1 but.... It will become harder and harder to find more different martial art to add....and people always ask for more characters

[3:08:29] <%sae_what> That's a purple ass LeiFei
[3:08:30] <+CHEETO_TAXES> Lei from Tekken and Lei in VF are equally annoying
[3:08:32] <%DoctorChurch> Sooo I’ve never seen anything from this game. How does it play?
[3:08:33] <%Bedskirts> @PFlare I know my stuff lol

[3:08:59] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Taisuru Customize items.
[3:09:00] <unknlai> and also some martial art in this game are already not so...realstic..ex. monkey style and ninjitsu of Kage.
[3:09:02] <soup_snek> Kappa
[3:09:04] <kobura57> Lei-fei matchup can be hard for beginners
[3:09:04] <%CptnCampy61> Is lei-fei hard to learn? He looks so dope
[3:09:05] <AMIdDST> @Wartogh Absorb Rollback Kreygasm
[3:09:08] <+SuperKokuJin916> Grape Drink Lei Fei!
[3:09:09] <Crippl3> @Taisuru custom costume piece
[3:09:11] <%AnimeCwboy> Lei Fei is very Maxi. He has a flow. @Maximilian_DOOD
[3:09:12] <@shinkuhadoken1> @unknlai decent point, but they can easily mix up the way people use martial arts and give them different moves.  Each style lends itself to at least a few ways to use it/apply it
[3:09:14] <Leodash_> Why is this game is not on EVO?
[3:09:14] <black_onyx36> It's Harry Potter.
[3:09:14] <$shwez> lol
[3:09:16] <%Bedskirts> @PFlare everyone here seems like they're either too old for it or too young for it

[3:09:43] <%SeanmanderPlays> LEF FEI
[3:09:48] <OptimusCack> 66p+k can mess with lei-fei's stance counters if he tries to get cheecky
[3:09:49] <%PFlare> @unknlai Monkey-Style Kung Fu is a real thing. The Ninjitsu of Kage is one of the few things that leans into the realm of impossible.
[3:09:50] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Meranglemtur Every 3D fighting game dev loves VF.
[3:09:51] <zhuravli> Oh yes there should held VF tourney asap
[3:09:53] <Sadrobotman> @DNICE3838 sorry but i like playing against people
[3:09:54] <%Man_in_the_Red> @meranglemtur he's a man of culture so i imagine so
[3:09:54] <DNICE3838> @leodash_  just too early maybe next evo
[3:09:56] <N30NxL1T3x> why does this song go so hard
[3:10:05] <%Bedskirts> @Meranglemtur I bet Harada plays El Blaze
[3:10:07] <Snesboxlive> atpOro
[3:10:09] <+SuperKokuJin916> This game will be at EVO. Sony helped fund this release.
[3:10:09] <ar2games> would a tekken character work in VF?
[3:10:09] <+TempestAri> Miroku - Inuyasha
[3:10:10] <cruzer2277> anyone got tips for brand new akira user?
[3:10:13] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> Tried playing Virtua Fighter 2 on Saturn with Jeffry, and pretty much gave up at the fourth match. Doesn't help that there's no training mode in that port.
[3:10:14] <+Shemzlove> This game visual looks pretty great
[3:10:14] <Wartogh> @Meranglemtur he envy vf, in fact he don't like to talk about it. Must be because he copied a lot from the early games
[3:10:15] <Leodash_> @cheddajones92 Strive still doesn't come out tho
[3:10:19] <soup_snek> @unknlai well it is a video game after all. hyper realism isn't really the goal
[3:10:20] <%CptnCampy61> @dpozner Looking cool is always a good motivator lol
[3:10:20] <OnTwitch_Hiding> (was he just toying with me before?)
[3:10:21] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @cruzer2277 LOT of practice
[3:10:31] <%Jinno9> @Bedskirts harada plays Jeffrey
[3:10:32] <AMIdDST> Why is music so good but sound effects so jank???

[3:10:51] <%MrSharpySon> This music is going in!
[3:10:54] <zenith0111> @ar2games Eh. The reason why we dont see so many cross franchise fight games is because characters very much exost within their system mechanics
[3:10:54] <+Genyito> btw did sega said something about any yakuza boys in any fighting games? Ichiban would be a nice fit in tekken, for example
[3:10:56] <@ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY> @VZLABoi go ask him
[3:10:56] <Ivigma> This game looks crazy slow lol

[3:22:53] <kill_lazaro> akira could cosplay as a cobra kai student

[3:29:35] <Zephyrus0> @GassyD not even close lol
[3:29:35] <%Brunty023> @filmdudejc94 No worries! doodGood
[3:29:38] <tacticalnuke002> Monke see, monke do
[3:29:41] <pscarnage> RETURN TO MONKE
[3:29:42] <%Man_in_the_Red> when's Eileen's debut in Super Monke Ball
[3:29:44] <%PFlare> @ryukenchi Actually, that's Pai.
[3:29:45] <@TiffanyLockheart> Ah got cha, I'm a sucker for those characters. @Viewtifulotaku7
[3:29:48] <%AmuroNT1> @UndeservingKonomichan cirOwO
[3:29:50] <fIashman92> She has 4 interupts and 8 cancels for you to learn
[3:29:56] <%Juicebox_FGC> Eileen has something like 2D fighter special moves. She has a list of "specials" that she can cancel into from various other moves
[3:29:57] <bennythejet504> Tifa for VF5 😂
[3:30:03] <+bl00d5h0ck> tf is VF??? Is this just SC x Tekken?
[3:30:03] <Nikopteros> doodLeon i got this thing
[3:30:05] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> This! Is! Sparta!
[3:30:08] <+ultradmann> Is max west coast?
[3:30:14] <%GassyD> @Zephyrus0 LUL I'm just sayin. It's my first day watchiing this game
[3:30:15] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @ultradmann Yes
[3:30:22] <%titanium_kyle> Eileen used Scratch!
[3:30:24] <+timw2sleep> this grab....
[3:30:25] <%quique_schz> Yes LA
[3:30:27] <kwannnn_> slapslapslap
[3:30:30] <ryukenchi> @PFlare im talking more about annoyance level. Pai isnt as annoying imo
[3:30:31] <trev_rawr> the gimmicks
[3:30:32] <%SleepyNingyo> craziness
[3:30:33] <%MrTekhnical> is the combo structure like DOA?
[3:30:35] <%Winnum> So is Eileen easy mode?
[3:30:36] <%elicnoceR> Damn doodCrazy
[3:30:36] <+LowHighKang> Is Eileen best at dishing out ring outs?
[3:30:37] <dion_nicolai> Simmons plays Eileen too
[3:30:39] <%ryokupo> @bl00d5h0ck Tekken is basically a copycat of this game.
[3:30:40] <Deli_Ninja> her style looks like monkey
[3:30:48] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @MrTekhnical Closest to it.
[3:30:49] <%DinoPulseZeta> @bl00d5h0ck Nah. Virtua Fighter PREDATES both of those SERIES.
[3:30:52] <%Man_in_the_Red> @lowhighkang no thats Kage
[3:30:55] <%UndeservingKonomichan> @AmuroNT1 abbaOwO hello person
[3:30:56] <%cheddajones92> @MrTekhnical yes
[3:30:57] <%titanium_kyle> @Deli_Ninja it is, iitc
[3:30:58] <kobura57> Eileen loves banana Kappa
[3:31:00] <+KZDeviluke> So I assume the netcode is bad beyond neighboring countries?
[3:31:00] <@shinkuhadoken1> oopsie
[3:31:01] <%ReKalibrate> @bl00d5h0ck VF is what inspired SC and Tekken and DOA
[3:31:03] <Nikopteros> dood that jean grab is sick
[3:31:03] <%titanium_kyle> @Deli_Ninja *iirc
[3:31:06] <tacticalnuke002> Simmons doesn't use Eileen's monkey stuff tho
[3:31:07] <journeymanapprentice> @LowHighKang Kage is more notorious
[3:31:08] <%AmuroNT1> @UndeservingKonomichan Haldo cute fwiendo cirOwO
[3:31:08] <+ultradmann> And doesn't most of the YoVideoGames crew live near each other?
[3:31:09] <+bl00d5h0ck> holy shit, REALLY? Damn, good to know😂
[3:31:10] <%PFlare> whoops.
[3:31:13] <Meranglemtur> @lowhighkang I think Kage is crazy when it comes to ring outs
[3:31:16] <ChaosImpact> Oò
[3:31:22] <AfternoonConcession> this game would get a lot of traction with guest characters but who would fit the reality of this game?
[3:31:29] <%OmniSTylez> whoa
[3:31:31] <%DinoPulseZeta> @bl00d5h0ck And Tekken's like a competitor that helped get made by former devs on this series.
[3:31:32] <+gophinobi23> Wouldn't say Tekken is a copycat, these two games are far too different and I prefer VF
[3:31:35] <%SleepyNingyo> monke magic!
[3:31:35] <%ifly4pocky> @ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY when i tried jp 2 years ago during the anni, it did allow us to choose a unit to get to final ascension 80/90 for no cost. so i'm pretty sure we should be getting that as well since all other annis from jp to na have been the same for the last few years
[3:31:39] <fIashman92> All of her gimmicks except 2 are weak to 2p
[3:31:42] <+fgcDraft> feel like long string heavy characters are scrub killers on this. Had a rough time against people continuously pressing buttons like Eileen and Sarah
[3:31:45] <bennythejet504> VF is the Granddaddy of 3D fighters
[3:31:46] <%sacra916cali> doodOuch
[3:31:47] <ar2games> Negan would fit...

[3:32:03] <@Nightbot> The Virtua Fighter series is a long standing 3D fighting game that started back in 1993 and is widely known as the 1st of it's kind and has set the grounds for numerous other 3D fighting games that follow after.

[3:32:22] <%Juicebox_FGC> Strings become less and less of an issue as you play, similar to Tekken. The difference is, you can evade in the middle of strings, as well as block punish.

[3:37:18] <Kobukson> the sounds of this game are an homage of classic hong kong kung fu cinema which is badass
[3:37:23] <%OmniSTylez> @MrTekhnical sure thing
[3:37:26] <OptimusCack> vf doesn't really have an unga bunga character, but it does have simpler characters like sarah or lau
[3:37:27] <@ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY> @ifly4pocky so could use it on her
[3:37:37] <%OmniSTylez> man this a good ass song

[3:38:37] <okatsu1> is this game on pc?
[3:38:44] <mariosonicboss> guess that makes sense since he's friends with lion
[3:38:44] <%StereoJericho> @OlivePowerRanger yes
[3:38:44] <rintaro420> it bother me so much that people are reading his name "jin" instead of "jan"
[3:38:45] <%spacecooboy> At least name wise
[3:38:47] <Meranglemtur> @chaosimpact maybe one of his parents is Japanese..
[3:38:48] <%MadcatMK6> Is it sad that whenever I hear Akira's theme, I always default to the PXZ version?

[3:39:10] <%yeknomlive> this ai is way better than the default
[3:39:12] <tacticalnuke002> He learnt Japanese to read Jojo because his last name is Kujo.
[3:39:13] <%marshin_d00d> Pog
[3:39:13] <+MisterRockett> The French are the next closest to anime boys Japan can justify.

[3:40:05] <jimbean711> His name is French, that’s about it
[3:40:09] <+JusticeSoulTuna> wakeup guessing in 3D games is brutal
[3:40:10] <samoori117> @maximilian_dood he looks like he came out of The Bouncer
[3:40:15] <EthanTurner047> Maybe Jean just likes to speak Japanese lol
[3:40:17] <%stardustdood> Could be like sean and laura from sf where they’re half Japanese
[3:40:18] <tacticalnuke002> Jean is a weeb like Chipp Zanuff
[3:40:19] <%mosskiddo> What are the types about?
[3:40:20] <%ifly4pocky> @ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY although if you are on the fence of who to ascend i do recommend using it on a character whose ascension materials you do not have much of or do not want to farm
[3:40:24] <%GoldenGear6> Well he has Abels fighting stance

[3:45:05] <industry_> i'm normally a big tekken 7 player but i gotta admit this game looks way more interesting
[3:45:19] <+zerovisible> wtf blocking sounds like ur scrolling in monster hunter
[3:45:21] <xlupin_iii> id play this on my ps5, if I had one
[3:45:24] <DSD24> VF2 Sarah theme is so good
[3:45:28] <Zephyrus0> @industry_ because it is.

[3:46:09] <Hansinkdu> This stage just reminds me that Soul Calibur exists and is still fun
[3:46:10] <@shinkuhadoken1> nice
[3:46:11] <%sleepyboy2d> Is Virtual Fighter just a poor man's verison of Tekken ?
[3:46:13] <%juan1_2_3> @BimboBagging well its AM2
[3:46:14] <%MrTekhnical> @zephyrus0 that a matter of opinion honestly
[3:46:15] <+Linoir> @GbIllusion Other way around. Tekken looks like Virtua Fighter.
[3:46:16] <%Juicebox_FGC> sidestep + P+K+G is a way of positioning your opponent towards a wall while knocked down. You can also use it against people holding G, to attack their side. But it doesn't "sidestep" anything, you just get hit if they press a button. @Maximilian_DOOD
[3:46:16] <+Nettacki> My favorite VF soundtrack is VF4 tbh. Some real bangers there, especially Sarah’s stage theme and Kage’s

[3:46:29] <+LeoStarnfire> is this game meant to be played slower than other fgs?

[3:47:08] <@Nightbot> The Virtua Fighter series is a long standing 3D fighting game that started back in 1993 and is widely known as the 1st of it's kind and has set the grounds for numerous other 3D fighting games that follow after.
[3:47:09] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> And they're underway! @juan1_2_3  @gengarhaunter
[3:47:10] <%OmniSTylez> yes @sleepyboy2d :)
[3:47:11] <DSD24> This is Lion’s theme right?
[3:47:11] <samoori117> This is like Bayonetta music a little bit
[3:47:13] <@shinkuhadoken1> nice!!!
[3:47:14] <thecheeze09> lol poor man's tekken
[3:47:15] <+RoninTheShadow900> Question. Is this UI part of the Legendary Pack?
[3:47:24] <%xenocraigmorph> @elicnocer Sounds awesome, man. Italy is beautiful ❤️. I am just getting ready for work, a few more weeks and a good month off to relax. doodGood doodTaco doodGood doodTaco doodGood doodTaco doodGood doodTaco doodGood doodTaco doodGood
[3:47:24] <%OmniSTylez> @sleepyboy2d hit the ball right outta the park
[3:47:24] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @RoninTheShadow900 Yes
[3:47:26] <%kungfupinoy> @Viewtifulotaku7 no
[3:47:29] <%juan1_2_3> yes VF is the SF2 of 3D fighters the first big one
[3:47:29] <kefka_himself> @gbillusion  not really they just two different games
[3:47:29] <%JIVEB0T> @RoninTheShadow900 yes
[3:47:32] <+Nettacki> @ronintheshadow900 yes
[3:47:34] <EthanTurner047> Dang, Shinku was close that round
[3:47:35] <tylovetx> a lot of  science in this game.
[3:47:43] <%wizchiefa23> Isn’t this’ll hat akira from earlier
[3:47:46] <PaidWellTheGeneral> The return of week of’s
[3:47:48] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @kungfupinoy I know, hence why it was in quotes.
[3:47:50] <GbIllusion> @zephyrus0 oh, well I've only played Tekken. it just looks very similar
[3:47:50] <m0h4mmed02> @dsd24 yes
[3:47:51] <%OmniSTylez> LUL
[3:47:53] <%The_Vengeful> 1 frame knees huh
[3:47:54] <+Seraphace> This is widely known to be better than tekken
[3:47:55] <%sleepyboy2d> Im asking cause i dont know lol
[3:47:58] <%kenobi47> akiras style is fengs style hmmm intresting
[3:48:00] <%OmniSTylez> NICE
[3:48:02] <%DedlokPM> @sleepyboy2d Is your comment just a poor man's version of bait?
[3:48:02] <%OmniSTylez> combos
[3:48:03] <%Brunty023> @Viewtifulotaku7 No cheesecake nearby to keep you sane?
[3:48:04] <+SuperKokuJin916> VF4 Sarah and Akira were my faves.  Kage's awesome too.  I remember buying the OST from Funcoland when I picked up the game! Memories...
[3:48:05] <unknlai> i think the dlc is polygen costume
[3:48:06] <DJ_is_Raiden> @GbIllusion laugh
[3:48:06] <+Linoir> @Gengarhaunter You speak the truth.
[3:48:08] <%KID_KUMA> how is he getting Knee Pop so easily??? a god
[3:48:10] <DSD24> @m0h4mmed02 Thank you
[3:48:10] <pr1me_778> Hey @Maximilian_DOOD I know this is off topic. What's the first game you would introduce to Ripley when she's in her teens?
[3:48:13] <%TokenBlackDood> did we switch to 360?
[3:48:14] <%titanium_kyle> @sleepyboy2d VF predates Tekken. early tekken played more like VF, even ad the moon jumps
[3:48:15] <+LeoStarnfire> it really feels pretty heavy and slugish. is that just a part of VF?
[3:48:18] <bennythejet504> Every character in VF is completely unique they have no copycat doubles
[3:48:18] <Baritone_Baphomet> @seraphace are you sure about that?
[3:48:25] <RedLine205> sidestep city
[3:48:31] <elementor374> @sleepyboy2d Of all the words, you used "poor man" bruh LUL
[3:48:32] <Auriculum> SourPls
[3:48:40] <%juan1_2_3> VF came first before tekken
[3:48:49] <pscarnage> @LeoStarnfire watch high level plays of VF, it's fast af
[3:48:49] <%Man_in_the_Red> let me put it this way, Virtua Fighter is so old school playstation pivoted to 3D development because VF1 looked so damn good at the time
[3:48:53] <+kami_k1d> My friend said jean is beyonetta may cry and he hasnt looked the same since
[3:48:54] <%juan1_2_3> and such a lot of stuff in early tekkens where like VF
[3:48:54] <+Seraphace> The following virtua fighter had in japan was insane
[3:48:55] <%retrozaid> @pr1me_778 he said he would like to discover what games she likes for herself
[3:48:56] <ensabahra> Comen
[3:48:58] <OwariNotSorry> nice parry
[3:48:59] <soup_snek> @LeoStarnfire ueah. hits literally have weight
[3:49:02] <DuskyNito> PogChamp
[3:49:04] <%sleepyboy2d> Im not trying to bait.  Tekken seems very polished compared to this
[3:49:12] <kefka_himself> lol this debate
[3:49:14] <ar2games> VF invented tekken lol
[3:49:17] <EmperorVon> UnSane UnSane
[3:49:21] <%DankyStankSwankyMank> @shinkuhadoken1 any tips for getting the knee so consistently? or is it just practice?
[3:49:22] <AfternoonConcession> when a game is delayed is it a guarantee that quality gets better? (KOF) @Maximilian_DOOD
[3:49:23] <%Juicebox_FGC> @Maximilian_DOOD All characters have a good CH move against someone's side. Jean's is 3K. But if they're going to Guard, you can use other moves. Side attacks get a frame bonus of +2, +3, or +6 based on the damage it does. You can make an unsafe launcher -safe- if you use it on someone's side. (Jean: 6K)
[3:49:24] <@shinkuhadoken1> hopefully it picks a new stage

[3:49:25] <+Linoir> @LeoStarnfire Not exactly. Any new people streaming this are probably kinda bad at the game right now. You need to look up tourneys. This game is anything BUT sluggish.
[3:49:29] <%littleyama89> So jean is a pretty dante? Lol
[3:49:30] <600greenknight> How strong is a raw 66P?
[3:49:30] <%juan1_2_3> thats because VF5 is over 10 years old
[3:49:34] <thecheeze09> VF is the grandaddy of 3d fighters for those who are young and don't know
[3:49:35] <%jacob_quenepa> hoiiii
[3:49:37] <+zerovisible> tekken is a poorly implemented vf
[3:49:38] <+CHEETO_TAXES> Tekken vs VF debate will never end
[3:49:40] <@shinkuhadoken1> @DankyStankSwankyMank practiced
[3:49:42] <%Magic8BallSaysNo> man, I can't get over well animated the characters and the block / hit reaction animations are
[3:49:46] <%DedlokPM> @sleepyboy2d 🎣
[3:49:46] <Hansinkdu> VF has more nostalgia then the overall flare Tekken brings
[3:49:51] <pscarnage> tekken fans/players lacking critical historical information LUL
[3:49:52] <Bosley8000> Akira looks off lol
[3:49:55] <%MtnDouken> @Maximilian_DOOD Really hoping Capcom shows something spectacular at E3.

[3:49:56] <%The_Vengeful> The amount of times I see 'Tekken' every time I look at the chat NotLikeThis
[3:49:57] <OptimusCack> [watching day 1 play of a game that took 10 years to get a new release] "this game looks sluggish"
[3:50:03] <Baritone_Baphomet> @zerovisible bait is obvious
[3:50:04] <ChaosImpact> I can't get over how Akira is so angry compare to his anime adaption LUL
[3:50:04] <Kobukson> VF invented 3D human models, without VF we wouldn't have 3D gaming
[3:50:04] <MadHatterWill> Tekken has supers this game is actually a more serious fighter then tekken 7
[3:50:05] <%kungfupinoy> @sleepyboy2d play some VF then and see how good you are
[3:50:07] <Auriculum> 66P gives you +18 Kreygasm
[3:50:07] <%OmniSTylez> i love akira perfect win quote when he says "try again in 100 years" LUL
[3:50:24] <%MrTekhnical> @ar2games inspired tekken maybe. created tekken nope
[3:50:24] <+HeyItsGuf> As a VF fan I've tried so many times to get into Tekken because it's more popular and I just always bounce off shaunfSad
[3:50:26] <zhuravli> This is why you should never skip history class Kappa
[3:50:27] <GbIllusion> this game is ps exclusive or Na?
[3:50:28] <%0Renegade4> 10 yeas too early
[3:50:32] <%0Renegade4> *years
[3:50:41] <%Man_in_the_Red> !vf5
[3:50:41] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[3:50:44] <%Juicebox_FGC> The game is only sluggish when you don't understand it. As you improve, movement becomes much more free-form. It's about predicting your opponent's attacks and evading them. It's not a "wait for the critical moment" game, you MAKE the moments!
[3:50:46] <SilentR444> @Kobukson without VF bugsnax wouldn't exist
[3:50:47] <%Kalzassa> @GbIllusion Yea it is
[3:50:49] <%DedlokPM> @GbIllusion ps exclusive
[3:50:50] <%OmniSTylez> @HeyItsGuf its okay, theres alweays doa :)
[3:50:50] <+crashtestfetus0> you didnt put any thought into that huh @Kobukson
[3:50:54] <Gengarhaunter> I love them critical edges, I mean… rage arts Kappa
[3:51:05] <+Locke_hart> see, i kinda wanna try VF more, but I dunno if I should spend the money since I don't have PS Plus already
[3:51:06] <ChaosImpact> !vf5
[3:51:09] <soup_snek> yes @GbIllusion
[3:51:11] <+SuperKokuJin916> nah. you can buy it on PSN for 30USD. it's also free on PS Now.
[3:51:12] <%littleyama89> But tekken throughout never had any supers just tekken 7.
[3:51:15] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Sometimes chat makes me wish I liked alcohol so then I could drink away this stuff. lytWIPED
[3:51:24] <+Archpath1> cmon chat  Soul Calibur is better  *wink*
[3:51:28] <bennythejet504> Tekken is way easier to play VF is extremely technical
[3:51:29] <kefka_himself> not because a fighting game has super makes it less serious lmao
[3:51:40] <GbIllusion> @archpath1 gross
[3:51:41] <unknlai> This game always feel like this, just as tekken is always like that, and thats why I love VF more since 20 years ago. Everyone has their own flavor...
[3:51:42] <elementor374> CHAT, you can like both Tekken and Virtua Fighter
[3:51:43] <Fullfatnog> I spent more on lunch today than a month of ps plus, c'mon guys
[3:51:44] <agusper11> I made it to 5th kyu Im a pro gamer now
[3:51:48] <%OmniSTylez> oh nice
[3:51:53] <%Baljhet> i mean, really, we should all be talking about the true champion of 3d fighting games: battle arena toshinden
[3:51:53] <OptimusCack> isn't the optimal combo off of akira's 214p just 214p 33p 66kk?
[3:51:55] <+Prideclaw> Dood Akira is hella buff.
[3:51:56] <+Linoir> Mechanics wise most people argue Virtua Fighter is more technical than Tekken, for those who are asking that sort of question.
[3:51:57] <%TheRedViper_x> so this game is all about mind games basically, you predict if your opponent will throw out and attack, and they predict whether you move or not?
[3:51:58] <%juan1_2_3> yes VF is super skilled
[3:52:06] <Ultimatefool> Who how do you enable VF2 hud
[3:52:07] <%GamingFreakChris> man why is VF so sick
[3:52:14] <pregoparafuso> @elementor374 Finally a voice of reason
[3:52:15] <andurated> if its a Drink, its gonna get drunk.
[3:52:15] <%Magic8BallSaysNo> NO, the rules are, you can only like 1 fighting game at a time, and whatever you don't like is the worst game ever!  THERE ARE RULES
[3:52:18] <%sleepyboy2d> How is VF harder than Tekken ?
[3:52:19] <%MrTekhnical> @archpath1 doodBro

[3:52:32] <Kobukson> it's true Sony decided they'll develop full 3D games after VF1 3D human models were possible
[3:52:32] <kid_kazuya> @Maximilian_DOOD have you played slob bunnies yet?
[3:52:34] <+hatamham5> VF is perhaps a fighting game that an advanced player will never lose to a beginner or intermediate player.
[3:52:34] <%OmniSTylez> gn doods

[3:52:38] <+RoninTheShadow900> This is my first VF game as a Tekken player and the first thing that came to mind was "i now understand why VF characters were in DOA"
[3:52:38] <%dethsycthe> i havent seen akira's double hop kick once yet and it makes me sad lol

[3:52:43] <%Lsirefoxl> andyS
[3:52:44] <+Nettacki> VF admittedly doesn’t have as extensive a selection of single player modes as Tekken, nor as much focus on story. Though 4, EVO, and 5 had Kumite and Quest modes
[3:52:45] <tamich74> Psn plus is 30% off now for a ye
[3:52:49] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @sleepyboy2d 3 button fighter so it has to make up for it with skill/combinations/player.

[3:52:57] <GbIllusion> these characters look cool as hell tho

[3:53:42] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> And I believe it being a more technical fighter is why Voitua Foighter never gained as much traction as Tekken during the new millennium, at least AFAIK.

[3:53:58] <@Viewtifulotaku7> VF doesn't do the long fancy juggle combos that Tekken is known for. A typical VF combo is 5 hits and does some good ass damage.
[3:54:02] <thecheeze09> that dude can pull off akira's dragon lance combo
[3:54:02] <%Juicebox_FGC> @hatamham5 Correct, being good at the game is something that can't be counter-picked. There are clear skill levels based on how much one has practiced and experienced.

[3:54:10] <soup_snek> @sleepyboy2d tighter time frames to pull off moves and a lot more directional inputs being used successively. also, they have SO many moves
[3:54:11] <+arcadus07> i dont think he has very many strings
[3:54:12] <GbIllusion> @momolued these stages lowkey remind me of soulcaliber
[3:54:15] <@Viewtifulotaku7> VF is more of a grounded based fighting game compared to Tekken.

[3:54:21] <@Nightbot> Check out our latest merch! Shirts, posters, mugs and more - https://maxdood.tv/merch
[3:54:29] <NrgSpoon> this is the most accessible VF has ever been, so i can imagine a huge jump in interest
[3:54:30] <+CHEETO_TAXES> VF inspired Tekken 1 and the success of Tekken 7 made VF5:US possible its all connected chat stop fighting.
[3:54:32] <%Schwim> Akira rocking the fancy smart watch

[3:55:00] <+LeoStarnfire> I am totally new to fgs. but are 3d fighter usually more slow and technical compared to 2d fighters?
[3:55:01] <OptimusCack> the one-frame knee isn't that amazing...althought it is a guaranteed launcher that's only -12 on block
[3:55:05] <thecheeze09> dude could do akira's knee at will
[3:55:06] <@Viewtifulotaku7> I really want to get good as Shinku is with Akira.
[3:55:07] <%FishTacosTonite> @juicebox_fgc I dropped and I picked up Akira. He just wasn't for me.
[3:55:10] <Fullfatnog> sidestep is digital, in Tekken it's analog
[3:55:10] <%stardustdood> Akira’s flashin’ his techno bracelet
[3:55:10] <%YuHuNuGu> Hey doods!
[3:55:12] <Riverdrag0n> like tekken!
[3:55:12] <%Lsirefoxl> andyRIP
[3:55:12] <@shinkuhadoken1> sidestep must be used when the attack is already out
[3:55:13] <%OverpoweredYeti> @maximilian_dood have you tried tournament mode?
[3:55:15] <+Linoir> Also for those of you who keep comparing this with Tekken... It's closer to a DOA game. Or I guess, DOA is a closer comparison than Tekken. Both are good games. But they offer different things.
[3:55:17] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Doing cancel knee is HARD af.
[3:55:18] <%MrTekhnical> @cheeto_taxes yup
[3:55:19] <%FishTacosTonite> @juicebox_fgc wolf
[3:55:28] <%Fatal_Fantom> Is it me or is Akira kinda unga?
[3:55:29] <%HawkGoggles2> Some times you just crouch and it's awkward
[3:55:34] <+fgcDraft> is there frame data info built in the game? Or do i have to look it up
[3:55:35] <%Brunty023> @OverpoweredYeti It's not available yet

[3:55:39] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Fatal_Fantom He kind of is.
[3:55:40] <SK_Kaelth> WHAT YOU CAN TURN TO OLD HUD WITHOUT MODS???
[3:55:42] <%xenocraigmorph> Tekken and VF are both awesome! Who cares which is "better"
[3:55:48] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @SK_Kaelth DLC
[3:55:51] <kefka_himself> @maximilian_dood  just practice i guess
[3:55:52] <+RoninTheShadow900> I've come to realize that if this game succeeds, SEGA will most like look into more of their older IP's
[3:55:53] <%TheRedViper_x> @LeoStarnfire not necessarily, you can have a really slow neutral game like SFV and a fast paced 3d fighter like Virtua Fighter
[3:55:57] <soup_snek> @LeoStarnfire eh kinda. the games can get quite fast if you get better
[3:55:57] <%Adwark> @LeoStarnfire It goes down to per game basis, but I'd say 3D fighters are something in between Street Fighter pace and anime fighter pace,
[3:56:01] <phrank86> is there an online pmode so u could check it out?
[3:56:03] <%OmegaZeroX2> @torawrathuwu goodnight Tora doodShine doodBro doodShine mom0kaMythradab

[3:56:20] <+Nettacki> VF4 I feel is when the series got a big boost in popularity in the US, especially after Tekken 4 came out and was considered kinda underwhelming
[3:56:31] <@Viewtifulotaku7> That was weird.
[3:56:34] <EthanTurner047> Shinku makes Akira unga, 'cause look at him go

[3:56:45] <@Viewtifulotaku7> My chat history basically just went back in time for a sec on it's own.
[3:56:49] <%kungfupinoy> Tekken has Kangaroos and Demons, it's not the same as VF at all.
[3:56:50] <+CHEETO_TAXES> Akira looks sick
[3:56:52] <%DedlokPM> @TiffanyLockheart I didn't see that as much as a comparison as much as a way to say how they are different

[3:57:12] <%TheRedViper_x> goddamn
[3:57:13] <%Juicebox_FGC> You Evade if you're at disadvantage, then tap up or down, and the opponent attacks. If you have advantage, or if the opponent doesn't attack, up/down won't give an Evade. @Maximilian_DOOD
[3:57:14] <FlowLethal> This guy has some experience

[3:57:20] <%TheGreatVizandu> Akira might be hard to learn but damn does he look cool
[3:57:21] <Slaythe> @Maximilian_DOOD btw you can remove Jean's dank undershirt in his third costume
[3:57:23] <pregoparafuso> MADA MADA!
[3:57:25] <%hoernchenspielt> 1st game i play i have a rage quitter... wtf

[3:57:27] <%littleyama89> But virtua fighter had a car as a guest character
[3:57:28] <+horsebootz> Its so intense how easy perfects can come since it can really just be a matter of making two major mistakes in a row
[3:57:28] <%titanium_kyle> @OmegaZeroX2 shotoGlow doodBro
[3:57:29] <%ifly4pocky> @ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY no problem, you should technically be fine with whoever you choose  since the units you're thinking of ascending are buster (well at least the 2 that you mentioned) as long as you got merlin although arjuna would be more recommended since he is good for farming, he deals extra damage over all class except foreigner, and has a battery of 30% at max lv. nobu requires more setup as their np gain isnt very high and their battery is only 20% at max lvl
[3:57:30] <%quique_schz> @shinkuhadoken1 how do you do the 1 frame hit consistently?
[3:57:31] <DSD24> Come on Sarah theme
[3:57:32] <OptimusCack> lows are almost all negative on hit, even on counter-hit
[3:57:34] <%skynja> you have to just flick the stick down or up to get sidestep. if you hold it for even a bit, it won't come out.
[3:57:37] <@TiffanyLockheart> It kinda put one above each other. Just trying to vibe it out. Nothing personal! :D @DedlokPM
[3:57:38] <+SecondSystem> @DedlokPM isn't saying how things are sifferent literally what a comparison is, lol
[3:57:41] <Mapplefury> hitting  low means you lose a turn?
[3:57:42] <%SeanmanderPlays> Eileen user
[3:57:42] <@shinkuhadoken1> @quique_schz taps i doint press guard very hard
[3:57:43] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Holy Paragraphs Batman!
[3:57:46] <%Brunty023> @TheGreatVizandu The payoff from learning Akira is so satisfying

[3:58:36] <TheAruarian> This track gives off such SFEX+A vibes
[3:58:43] <%leith_aziz> Does Max know about the KOF XV news? Curious
[3:58:44] <charlizeback> VF only uses kick and punch right?
[3:58:51] <DSD24> Das boot
[3:58:51] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @leith_aziz Yes
[3:58:55] <%stardustdood> Somewhere in these woods, Kage is slamming his head right onto the ground
[3:58:58] <%bustahwulf170> Dat boot-kick tho.

[3:59:05] <ar2games> kinda funny that Kage has DP but Akira doesn´t
[3:59:05] <%Winnum> Enjoying the stream but looking at my PS5 like "Could play a few games right now...."
[3:59:06] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> Holy shit, I think I just caused an argument to erupt, based on what I felt were lore and character differences between VF and Tekken.
[3:59:06] <+Nettacki> Kick, Punch, and Guard
[3:59:07] <%TheCheezcakeMan> What game yall talkin about @ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY ?

[4:00:10] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[4:00:10] <zhuravli> @leith_aziz what kof news?
[4:00:11] <Progearspec> @pregoparafuso hmm pai and kage
[4:00:15] <%Man_in_the_Red> @neurologic Ryu ga Gotoku engine baybee

[4:00:22] <%The_Vengeful> Akira is a motherfucker
[4:00:23] <heero719> nice
[4:00:28] <Vex_Varen> When did dante make it into VF5?
[4:00:29] <%Baljhet> @neurologic it's the same game logic re-rendered and modeled in the Dragon Engine, from Yakuza 7.
[4:00:30] <%leith_aziz> @zhuravli KOF XV got delayed till 2022
[4:00:31] <JUJUxANONY> Nice sidestep
[4:00:33] <thecheeze09> reading is tough
[4:00:34] <$merrowlink20> If you mash with El Blaze you're trash
[4:00:34] <elementor374> @littleyama89 he already knows bruh
[4:00:36] <%The_Grand_SC> are u having fun Max?
[4:00:40] <%Adwark> @ifly4pocky @ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY Just spread longer text into multiple messages :P
[4:00:41] <%TheCheezcakeMan> I havent touched FGO in two years
[4:00:42] <+arcadus07> its hard to confirm a sidestep imo
[4:00:42] <%titanium_kyle> @TheCheezcakeMan shotoGlow doodBro

[4:00:48] <CelXIII> yooo Chat and Max!!! doodBro doodBro doodShine doodShine <3 <3
[4:00:48] <charlizeback> Shun Di is my fav. thanks for the answers!
[4:00:49] <%TheCheezcakeMan> Good gacha game though
[4:00:49] <@ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY> @Adwark HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[4:00:50] <%xenocraigmorph> I really hope Virtua Fighter can make a big come back with this remaster.
[4:00:50] <goofyfella> probably just get used to sidestepping and more full tracking buttons
[4:00:51] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @The_Grand_SC If he is still playing, yes.
[4:00:52] <%TheRedViper_x> akira looks like a very rewarding character to learn
[4:00:53] <ekonoodle> there a delay in a FAILED sidestep
[4:00:53] <%littleyama89> Ah ok.
[4:00:54] <ChaosImpact> "super tough" immediately dodge Akira's first attack
[4:00:57] <%Juicebox_FGC> @LeoStarnfire Sidesteps only work when you have framedisadvantage, and the opponent attacks. That's when pressing up or down gives an "Evade".
[4:00:57] <kefka_himself> @maximilian_dood   practice makes perfect man
[4:00:58] <%XionBarzhad> bawkCoffee Are ya winning son?
[4:00:58] <+GarraOmega> No swimsuits Sadge
[4:01:00] <%neurologic> @baljhet @man_in_the_red that's freaking dope!
[4:01:02] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> So I assume music customization is a feature exclusive to this iteration of VF5, right?
[4:01:04] <DSD24> FGO is fun
[4:01:04] <%TheCheezcakeMan> @titanium_kyle Sup mah dood
[4:01:06] <+fgcDraft> nice side steps @Maximilian_DOOD PogChamp
[4:01:11] <OptimusCack> technically the dragon engine is from yakuza 6, but yes
[4:01:13] <tamich74> So is this game yours forever with psn plus or only for w months?
[4:01:18] <%Adwark> @ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY I wouldn't knew it was gacha paragraph if I haven't played that one myself bawkSmug
[4:01:18] <%juan1_2_3> I feel like sega is releasing this as a Intrested test
[4:01:21] <+aroo27> they call this a poor man's Tekken because frame data isn't paywalled Kappa
[4:01:24] <+Bariman98> DAYUM
[4:01:25] <CaliKingz01> this music. omg Nostalgia
[4:01:25] <%Juicebox_FGC> @LeoStarnfire But, the Evade also won't work if the opponent throws, uses a circular, or doesn't attack.
[4:01:26] <%juan1_2_3> just to see the intrest in VF
[4:01:29] <%juan1_2_3> if there is a lot
[4:01:29] <Jonrskittles> sidestep has an odd timing to it, took me a while to understand
[4:01:33] <%RofflessLWK> @leith_aziz I think it was at the start of the previous stream! I joined this one pretty late, but I do remember hearing him briefly talk about it haha
[4:01:35] <%ifly4pocky> @ZaWarudoWRYYYYYYY all good
[4:01:36] <%soulkicker2012> @tamich74 yours forever
[4:01:37] <%juan1_2_3> then likey a new VF will be made
[4:01:37] <+LowHighKang> This MUSIC is DOPE
[4:01:40] <%DedlokPM> @Adwark I personally think that is worse than a wall of text because it is more likely to get missed. :p
[4:01:41] <%leith_aziz> I remember Mustard's stream of this game and his connections were much worse. Seems like Max's getting lucky to some extent, or maybe the servers are working as intended
[4:01:42] <+Sneakman98> @aroo27 lol
[4:01:43] <+Coltaine44> as long as you sub to ps plus you can play it
[4:01:44] <BimboBagging> If it's in the dragon engine there is no "reason" it couldn't be ported to PC right?
[4:01:45] <%Kalzassa> @tamich74 as long as you have a PS Plus subscription then it is yours.
[4:01:47] <%Adwark> @aroo27 bawkKek enigmaKEK
[4:01:50] <%The_Grand_SC> @viewtifulotaku7 Thats good to hear, wish I could be able to play this at a decent level cause it looks sick af
[4:01:51] <zhuravli> @leith_aziz Ah i see. Thank you
[4:01:51] <+Nettacki> @tamich74 it’s yours for as long as your PS Plus is active
[4:01:53] <+SecondSystem> @aroo27 lmao okay that's a good one
[4:01:54] <%leith_aziz> @RofflessLWK: Thanks
[4:01:55] <+ImSoAingry> akira noises intensifies
[4:02:01] <%dethsycthe> @Juicebox_FGC so sidestep only works on a good read? if its a bad read it won't come out?

[4:02:04] <+pedlar15> Delay based netcode is not ok in 2021 ngl
[4:02:06] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @BimboBagging Possible, but being handled and paid for by Sony.
[4:02:07] <+fgcDraft> @aroo27 is there frame data in the game? On training mode?
[4:02:15] <%XionBarzhad> @leith_aziz He literally said: "Oh yeah, KOF got delayed. Good. Probably due to rollback." That was the extent of his comment.
[4:02:15] <%leith_aziz> @BimboBagging Tell that to SEGA and the Yakuza games
[4:02:20] <%Adwark> @DedlokPM On mobile I guess it can be pain in the arse to follow conversations like this LUL
[4:02:22] <%SeanmanderPlays> @Maximilian_DOOD This game doesnt like have auto stuff ?
[4:02:24] <@shinkuhadoken1> that was actually incredible
[4:02:25] <%Man_in_the_Red> @bimbobagging Sony does have a vested interest to prevent it, or at least charge sega for it LUL
[4:02:25] <JUJUxANONY> that was good
[4:02:25] <%kungfupinoy> @juan1_2_3 It's some sort of SEGA anniversary thing.
[4:02:26] <@shinkuhadoken1> that parry
[4:02:26] <%leith_aziz> Judgement is still only on STadia
[4:02:27] <%Juicebox_FGC> @dethsycthe Exactly! That's the point! VF is all about the reads.
[4:02:28] <%TheRedViper_x> was that a parry?

[4:02:35] <OptimusCack> sony is the reason this won't come to pc since they ponied up the cash to make this happen
[4:02:36] <tamich74> Thanks the being available until August 2 had me confused
[4:02:45] <%dethsycthe> @Juicebox_FGC hella interesting
[4:02:50] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Maximilian_DOOD Closest "Auto" is Jacky's neutral parry.
[4:02:50] <DSD24> Come on Sarah Stage
[4:02:50] <%SeanmanderPlays> So this game is really technical
[4:02:51] <Profmcstevie> All manual, everything comes from thought
[4:02:53] <+pelusa001> hi chat i just got on, is this online matches?
[4:02:54] <%Otoshi_Gami> Pretty much
[4:02:55] <%SeanmanderPlays> Might be hard

[4:03:00] <%leith_aziz> @XionBarzhad Well, at least I can focus on Strive this year and both games get some room to breath
[4:03:03] <elementor374> @leith_aziz what do you mean by that?
[4:03:05] <ar2games> Goh kinda has auto grab
[4:03:05] <+Coltaine44> it will probably come to pc at some point, doubt it will come to xbox though or switch

[4:03:32] <%stardustdood> Jackie’s neutral parry is so damn sick
[4:03:32] <%XionBarzhad> @leith_aziz Pretty much. The less things coming out in June the better. Can't play everything.

[4:03:39] <ChaosImpact> MCWILD THEME
[4:03:40] <%Juicebox_FGC> @dethsycthe If you think they will evade, throw/circular/delay an attack. If you think they will guard, throw or guardbreak them if you have one! Make a choice! Many, many times in a row.
[4:03:41] <Wartogh> Chat, have you ever watched the april first VF5 video where SEGA made a fake trailer making it play more like tekken and with hadokens and shoryukens?
[4:03:43] <%Mengetsu> SourPls
[4:03:47] <%TheRedViper_x> oh man they delayed KOF 15??? that sucks
[4:03:48] <%vydos> What's the name of this song?
[4:03:48] <%DedlokPM> @Adwark I don't even bother with chat on mobile. Still I would rather do and get a wall of text than many smaller messages. Like I said, more likely to get lost in the shuffle.
[4:03:48] <%leith_aziz> @elementor374: About what?
[4:03:48] <+TheCrimsonPugilist> fuck I hope they bring this to pc eventually this looks really fun
[4:03:48] <+LeoStarnfire> is it considered cheating to macros in VF5. i noticed i can program buttons to do p+k etc?
[4:03:48] <GAFC__> is it worth getting GG strive on pc as your first fighter since early 2000's to get back into
[4:03:54] <+SuperKokuJin916> VF5US is available for $30 on PSN or FREE  if you're an active PS+ or PS Now subscriber.
[4:03:58] <pscarnage> jesus that shoulder check monkaS
[4:03:59] <theramazing27> will this game get popular when its ps4 exclusive?
[4:04:04] <kefka_himself> @pelusa001  it also has an arcade mode though havent tryed yet
[4:04:08] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @GAFC__ If you want to, go ahead.
[4:04:19] <Jirojairokai> You know when boomers tell you "FGs used to be all about skill with no bullshit"? This is the only game that comes close to that.
[4:04:22] <%oddprototype> was that a hellsweep???
[4:04:25] <@Nightbot> Watch our YoVideogames stream archives on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/yovideogames
[4:04:28] <%leith_aziz> @GAFC__ I'd say yes. It has rollback, a new community, goood enough tutorials
[4:04:30] <elementor374> @leith_aziz Judgment on stadia thing?
[4:04:30] <%bustahwulf170> This Akira really turned on the jets.
[4:04:31] <%leith_aziz> *good
[4:04:37] <r0se> @GAFC__ id say so, its basically a reset on the series so theres gonna be a lot of learning, new players, and good netcode
[4:04:38] <%wibbwobbler> Glad this came out, really having fun with it
[4:04:39] <%kungfupinoy> weird how it might not make it to X-Box, Sega and Microsoft used to be partners.
[4:04:42] <+m0tyf> that roll looks like it would do no damage IRL LUL
[4:04:44] <%Adwark> @theramazing27 To be fair most of FGC is around PS4s/PCs so PS4 is still pretty good place to work with.
[4:04:44] <@Leon_Tekashi> Another good VF5 stream. Really nice to know that the netcode is stable enough to be playable, so I might keep an eye on VF5 and pick it up, hence why I asked about Aoi. With that said though, I'm off to bed for the night. Have yourselves a damn good one, keep blazing, and I'll see you all later. Leon out! doodGood doodShine
[4:04:44] <BlueThunder4242> @LeoStarnfire im pretty sure its just remaping so it of i guess
[4:04:44] <+CHEETO_TAXES> @GAFC__ Yeah its probably the best place to start. it will still be difficult though
[4:04:45] <+aroo27> @theramazing27 I think the ps4 is kind of popular..
[4:04:51] <%leith_aziz> @elementor374 The game got ported to Stadia, but it's not even oon Steam
[4:04:53] <+Coltaine44> no boomers talk about fighting games anything

[4:05:06] <+Linoir> @theramazing27 It only needs to have good numbers as far as downloads / online matches. If it does, Sega may finally work on a new one, which would be the more likely multi-console game. As it is, maybe this will come to PC eventually.
[4:05:07] <pscarnage> @kungfupinoy fingers crossed that it's a timed exclusive, really want to play this version
[4:05:08] <%Winnum> * a bad place sorry

[4:05:38] <%TheRedViper_x> it seems like sidesteps only seem to work in an advantage state
[4:05:40] <OptimusCack> all characters have the same hp
[4:05:49] <%TokenBlackDood> @juicebox_fgc thank you so much
[4:05:51] <tamich74> I wish there was stats for consecutive players on ps games like steam
[4:05:54] <$juliansitobae> Bitch im wildddddd
[4:05:54] <kefka_himself> @kungfupinoy   yeah we can only hope we also get pso to ps4
[4:06:00] <%The_Vengeful> It'll display the default HP in arcade mode
[4:06:06] <@Viewtifulotaku7> aliwayGun
[4:06:11] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Play as "GTFO"
[4:06:11] <%SnipingMonkey> is it GG that has like different HP for each character?
[4:06:12] <SirYamms> Who needs knees anyeays?
[4:06:15] <+Linoir> pso2 was already on ps4
[4:06:18] <Zarteke> I didn't know akira had the same martial art style as julia, this sure is weird to watch for the first time as a tekken player
[4:06:21] <+SuperKokuJin916> Remember VF4 was exclusive to PS2 and that did extremely well.
[4:06:23] <pscarnage> 🔫 KKona
[4:06:28] <%qtgothwaifu> that will never happen @kefka_himself
[4:06:33] <ChaosImpact> OOH, nice parry
[4:06:34] <%Juicebox_FGC> @TheRedViper_x They work if you have disadvantage. you cant evade if you're plus. you also cant evade if they throw, or circular, or dont attack. An evade is you guessing that the opponent will 'take their turn'.

[4:06:45] <%Man_in_the_Red> @snipingmonkey most fighters have different health for characters
[4:06:55] <%leith_aziz> @SnipingMonkey It is one of them. Characters like Chipp, Millia and I-No have less health than other characters. While Potemkin for example has more health than the rest of the cast
[4:07:02] <%Adwark> @Linoir But not in the west unfortunately.
[4:07:05] <kefka_himself> @linoir  really, never saw it
[4:07:10] <Jonrskittles> Anyone know of Max finished Returnal?
[4:07:10] <%leith_aziz> SFV for example alsoo has diffrent HP pools
[4:07:11] <Mapplefury> akira is a bit heavier than other characters i think so some c9mhosnm8ght not work
[4:07:15] <unknlai> julia actaully use the same martial art, though XD
[4:07:17] <+Linoir> ...In Japan exclusively, that is. PSO2 was on ps4... and ps vita, in japan, exclusively.
[4:07:19] <%ifly4pocky> @SnipingMonkey gg and blazblue i believe
[4:07:20] <+joeldombek> SS is very powerful
[4:07:26] <roguetomat01> what game introduced auto combos ?
[4:07:28] <%SnipingMonkey> ah interesting . . . thanks everyone doodGood
[4:07:29] <elementor374> @jonrskittles he has
[4:07:29] <tacticalnuke002> @jonrskittles He did
[4:07:33] <fIashman92> 75% damage in 2 reads lol
[4:07:34] <ChaosImpact> 60% just gone after 2 combos LUL
[4:07:40] <@Viewtifulotaku7> ....
[4:07:43] <@Viewtifulotaku7> !returnal
[4:07:43] <%RiderNitsuga> Jesus fuck, when ya said this game is heavy read dependant, you weren't lying
[4:07:43] <@Nightbot> Returnal is a PS5 ONLY game that is a 3rd person rogue-lite shooter. Currently this is Max's GOTY.
[4:07:50] <+LowHighKang> Whats the name of this stage music?
[4:07:58] <OptimusCack> evades only work if they're done as an attack is coming out. that's how you get a successfully evade
[4:08:00] <@shinkuhadoken1> your defense is rising
[4:08:00] <NrgSpoon> there's a reason the round timer is so short
[4:08:02] <%leith_aziz> You ever played against Jacky? Guy does 30% with a flip
[4:08:05] <SwiftyJET> doodBait
[4:08:06] <kefka_himself> @linoir   ohh ic oh well
[4:08:07] <%SnipingMonkey> to be fair . . . if you got comboed IRL . .. you would also lose 60% of your HP LUL
[4:08:11] <kobura57> VF2 music

[4:08:34] <pscarnage> catJAM
[4:08:40] <+fgcDraft> It's kind of doo doo that Tekken's all about movement, yet afaik they've nerfed side stepping. And this game is all about in your face yet SS is very important.
[4:08:42] <%soulkicker2012> not to mention there is defensive step and offensive step

[4:08:45] <+Nettacki> @snipingmonkey if you got comboed in real life you’d probably die 4Head
[4:08:49] <ChaosImpact> @LowHighKang The music in the beach stage was Jeffry theme in VF2
[4:08:51] <%leith_aziz> ah, this chill music
[4:08:53] <%Kalzassa> @Nomenanza somebody asking if max finished the game happythoGiggle
[4:08:54] <%littleyama89> Chat, can you custom the music or is it random?
[4:08:54] <SirYamms> Damn look at that SAND TEK
[4:08:55] <@Viewtifulotaku7> I still don't get the timing on offensive steps.
[4:09:01] <cheetah1546> akira so hard to fight against
[4:09:05] <llllovetttt> just read up on the vf lore,why does this game not have story mode?
[4:09:05] <%Nomenanza> @Viewtifulotaku7 ah ok
[4:09:12] <%Baljhet> Isn't Lost Judgment coming to PC?
[4:09:14] <%SnipingMonkey> Nettacki yea if you get powerbomed on concrete 4Head
[4:09:15] <%Senju_in_Japan> Has the HUD always looked that Retro?
[4:09:15] <%RofflessLWK> @pregoparafuso Yup, Dragon Engine!
[4:09:17] <%juan1_2_3> yakuza engine yes
[4:09:19] <fangovafang> @tiffanylockheart KonCha
[4:09:22] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @llllovetttt Because they just want to focus on a fighting game.
[4:09:22] <%SquallAdv> love the classic VF UI / life bars <3
[4:09:28] <elementor374> @pregoparafuso yeah judgemnt uses dragon engine
[4:09:28] <EtherNigh> I think this guys is stream snipping you max Kappa
[4:09:30] <%Man_in_the_Red> @llllovetttt its a waste of development resources
[4:09:30] <%leith_aziz> @Baljhet It is? I didnt see any omention of that
[4:09:34] <%Juicebox_FGC> @Viewtifulotaku7 Offensive step is up or down, wait a tiny moment, then P+K+G.
[4:09:44] <@Viewtifulotaku7> VF doesn't need lore. Just let it be a fun fighting game and that be it.
[4:09:45] <+Phinman25> Phinman25 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:09:48] <+zeoxTV> @Baljhet only announced for consoles so far
[4:09:49] <%ifly4pocky> @littleyama89 if you buy the dlc, it'll let you use the previous vf soundtracks, otherwise no
[4:09:51] <%RofflessLWK> @Baljhet Nope, no plans for that yet if I remember correctly from an article I read a while back
[4:09:58] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Juicebox_FGC I get it, but the timing and use of it still throws me off.
[4:10:01] <@TiffanyLockheart> Sometimes you don't need a reason to fight. @llllovetttt
[4:10:07] <llllovetttt> i disagree
[4:10:10] <%soulkicker2012> @Viewtifulotaku7 offensive steps are really good when the opponent is knocked down and you want to reposition youself
[4:10:13] <ChaosImpact> Respect the wake up doodCrazy
[4:10:15] <IIIAxeCopIII> @viewtifulotaku7 amen preacher
[4:10:17] <%Baljhet> Huh. Yeah, it isn't. I'm insane. rooDerp
[4:10:21] <%titanium_kyle> @Senju_in_Japan retro HUD and OST are part of the $10 legendary dlc. So are customize parts and VF1 model costuimes for everty1
[4:10:22] <+Linoir> @llllovetttt a lot of the games came before a modern mk, injustice, tekken, sf5, blazblue etc style storty was common place in fighters. it's closer to the classic KOF story modes, as in select correct team, beat final boss, get true ending thats canon to next game
[4:10:23] <$xBlood_RaidenNx> MAX IS THIS GAME GOOD?
[4:10:23] <%03TomSau> Nice
[4:10:27] <%leith_aziz> @Viewtifulotaku7: I wouldn't say it doesn't matter, but there was probably not enough budget for that. The game is pretty lacking on content
[4:10:29] <@TiffanyLockheart> You never been in the street and someone just have beef with you randomly in the streets of NYC and you get into a fight? lmmao @llllovetttt
[4:10:39] <sabatman> bitch i'm wild aroooooo
[4:10:42] <tacticalnuke002> According to the VF lore, Kage Maru is the main character
[4:10:44] <+arcadus07> wow the 1f knee, nice
[4:10:48] <Mapplefury> is wake up attack invincible?
[4:10:50] <%Juicebox_FGC> @Viewtifulotaku7 basically, it is useless against attacks. It doesn't avoid anything. If someonee guards a lot, you can Offensive step, then attack their side. Your attack must be buffered (come out first frame) in order to register as a side attack.
[4:10:51] <+Rikka66> @viewtifulotaku7 tell that to whoever made dural
[4:10:52] <zezima133> wow
[4:10:52] <OptimusCack> offensive step is most for repositioning
[4:10:56] <%Billiesan> The Virtua Fighter Kids Soundtrack is hidden in the Menu. Select VF2 and Press Option.
[4:11:04] <+Scrubz01> hmmm... wasn't there an arcade adventure mode?
[4:11:04] <pscarnage> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:11:08] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @leith_aziz When it comes to VF I never cared about lore and that works out for VF.
[4:11:14] <%jacob_quenepa> oraaa
[4:11:17] <ar2games> the lore is in the manual, no joke
[4:11:37] <elementor374> What if the yakuza games writer went and write a story for the next VF game? hmm. VF doesn't need lore, but what if?
[4:11:39] <@Viewtifulotaku7> And as someone said, the only real lore in this game is that Kage is basically the main character and his mom is Dural.
[4:11:40] <@shinkuhadoken1> u can attack a wakeup attack if it's a very powerful attack it'll beat it
[4:11:41] <%XionBarzhad> I think I remember 4 having some sort of Story mode. Was meh.
[4:11:44] <+Mistouze> it's so cool to have VF back on current hardware and the netcode just WORKS (at least for me)
[4:11:44] <+MyJoJob> wait you can have VF kids music??
[4:11:46] <@TiffanyLockheart> If it's fun to play, that's all that matters to me haha
[4:11:48] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Also Kage has so far won the most VF tournaments.
[4:11:52] <%Adwark> @TiffanyLockheart I'd appreciate personally being able to learn more about character personality beyond just "does fighting" stuff. It can make some characters feel even cooler than just by design
[4:11:53] <thecheeze09> speaking of lore, i know that lau has some form of cancer
[4:11:55] <+Epicdude456> Did Max share his thoughts on KOF XV being delayed to 2022?
[4:12:00] <FlowLethal> Isn’t lore about kage
[4:12:01] <llllovetttt> i think they should make a story mode for vf6 for people that want it.
[4:12:02] <Slaythe> there isn't ??
[4:12:03] <%SnipingMonkey> thinking Yakuza series has good lore KEKW
[4:12:06] <OptimusCack> offensive step has always been pretty goofy, but it does have it's uses
[4:12:07] <SirYamms> There's probably a setting somewhere
[4:12:07] <%titanium_kyle> @Viewtifulotaku7 yeah he won 3 and 4 iirc
[4:12:09] <%SnipingMonkey> now that was a good joke KEKW
[4:12:11] <%leith_aziz> @Viewtifulotaku7: Well, we can keep it that way for VF I guess. My point is that it's not really pointless. Though I am a guy who tends to apreciate lore
[4:12:11] <The_Artkeep> crap, I wouldn't mind if they connected the whole VF lore with Yakuza at this point
[4:12:11] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Epicdude456 He did at the start.
[4:12:15] <ShionMu> is there an option to turn off replay except the last one?
[4:12:17] <@TiffanyLockheart> I mean for sure but also forcing something doesn't help either haha @Adwark
[4:12:19] <pregoparafuso> @elementor374 VF with a story is basically Shenmue

[4:14:06] <pscarnage> NotLikeThis
[4:14:07] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> @blazingrush Good news: Versions for other consoles have been hinted at.
[4:14:07] <%SnipingMonkey> Adwark well the story does get a little wonky at times LUL
[4:14:07] <gigamesh00> 👉
[4:14:08] <%Brunty023> I leave for a second and someone said Yakuza got no lore!? WHAT!? doodBait
[4:14:09] <OptimusCack> the heart of all vf lore is that yu suzuki once drunkenly goaded a bajiquan practicioner into back checking him, and it knocked suzuki out cold
[4:14:11] <jukebox2014> ohh man
[4:14:11] <tacticalnuke002> Watch this JoJo pose forever
[4:14:12] <%leith_aziz> That's the Jotaro posee

[4:14:14] <%Otoshi_Gami> another CRASH POSE hype :p
[4:14:17] <+KingZai> the jojo pose broke it
[4:14:19] <%video199x> @Maximilian_DOOD did you see the KOF delay?
[4:14:19] <%MetatronM> i just realized, did we talk about the KOF XV delay?
[4:14:20] <+arcadus07> yea it crashed for me earlier too
[4:14:27] <%Adwark> @SteelaiRizel I mean guy has literally "Kujo" as his last name LUL
[4:14:28] <%RofflessLWK> The only thing that heavily bugs me about Yakuza's story/lore/whatever you call it is that they completely ditched Kaoru..... I really liked her so much TearGlove
[4:14:33] <+Nettacki> @tiffanylockheart HeyGuys
[4:14:34] <@shinkuhadoken1> GGs @Maximilian_DOOD I feel you learned a TON in the way of flow and your Jean is doing quite well
[4:14:34] <%leith_aziz> @MetatronM Yes
[4:14:35] <+Nave1337> gonna play ratchet and clank?
[4:14:36] <%SnipingMonkey> @Maximilian_DOOD how was the connections for tonight mate?
[4:14:37] <%lordlad> Sega please.....
[4:14:38] <Molehj> that no where near flamboyant enough for Jojo
[4:14:39] <%Billiesan> the VF Kids soundtrack is hidden in the options menu.
[4:14:40] <%Kyle_Steen> Lore is one of the main 3 reasons youd play Yakuza
[4:14:40] <%Adwark> @MetatronM Apparently did.
[4:14:42] <%Mengetsu> At least it crashes after the match
[4:14:42] <%NyanKitzu> @SnipingMonkey oh boy LUL LUL LUL
[4:14:42] <@TiffanyLockheart> tiffosSoraWave @Nettacki
[4:14:44] <elementor374> Yakuza 4 story is so stupid man LUL
[4:14:45] <%Juicebox_FGC> If you Evade, in 99% of situations, you have good frame advantage. You can treat them like Mid/Throw 50/50s generally. But if you mid, the opponent can evade that, and it becomes an evasion battle. @Maximilian_DOOD
[4:14:47] <+Linoir> Delay is unfortunate, but a better KOF game is worth the wait.
[4:14:48] <kobura57> There is a lot of things you can do on sideturn
[4:14:49] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> doodBait  👉
[4:14:52] <keki_ssb> yesterday was working pretty good weird
[4:14:54] <@shinkuhadoken1> yeah for sure, that's why I stuck with Akira
[4:15:01] <@shinkuhadoken1> monkey bitch is too crazy
[4:15:04] <%leith_aziz> @RofflessLWK That was a big shame. Apparently it had to do with her actress.
[4:15:04] <Jonrskittles> just saw if Max finished Returnal, he didn't get true ending tho
[4:15:08] <%SnipingMonkey> NyanKitzu also . . . 1 v 100
[4:15:13] <%Fuukoji> Apparently KOF got Delayed to Q1 2022
[4:15:15] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if Sega decides to connect the VF universe with Virtua Cop and Last Bronx and the like.
[4:15:16] <@shinkuhadoken1> I added you as well
[4:15:20] <@Nightbot> Check out our latest merch! Shirts, posters, mugs and more - https://maxdood.tv/merch

[4:15:46] <%kungfupinoy> @TargetmasterHotRodimus Fighters Megmix did it already
[4:15:54] <@shinkuhadoken1> @rintaro420 this game is free on psn and has a great tutorial mode to tell you about these things! :)
[4:15:55] <nursemorrigan> what is with those facial expressions jesus
[4:15:57] <$shwez> i thought 5th kyu minimum? xD
[4:15:57] <jukebox2014> first match

[4:16:23] <Progearspec> easy as pai ;)
[4:16:24] <pregoparafuso> @DSD24 Yep

[4:16:27] <%TheRedViper_x> what was that lmaoooooo
[4:16:30] <The_Artkeep> has max played/stream any of the yakuza games before?

[4:16:35] <HiTopTTime> Ik that kick had to hurt
[4:16:40] <%NyanKitzu> @SnipingMonkey LUL LUL LUL
[4:16:43] <%RofflessLWK> @leith_aziz Oh, really? I remember reading something about the writer or whoever not wanting Kiryu to be romantically tied to anyone haha. Such a shame indeed, their chemistry was so good imo... Which is why Y2 is my favourite after 0~
[4:16:43] <%SnipingMonkey> NyanKitzu dont forget all the events at the certain tower too LUL
[4:16:43] <ShionMu> @kefka_himself ps4 or ps5?
[4:16:45] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @juanmatrix01 Telling streamer to use different characters?

[4:16:59] <DSD24> @pregoparafuso Oh my gosh that's so silly, thanks for clarifying
[4:17:00] <+fgcDraft> i love and hate the fact that waking up you're basically fully invincible until whatever LOL
[4:17:01] <rintaro420> @shinkuhadoken1 I know I was just kidding x), I suck at this game and find your matches cool to watch
[4:17:01] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> @kungfupinoy I know, but if Virtua Cop and Striker and even Virtua Hamster were connected to VF like Sega's initial Virtua series plan.
[4:17:03] <%Brunty023> @The_Artkeep He gave Yakuza 0 a shot, but ended up stopping a bit in Chapter 2 before it ramped up
[4:17:03] <elementor374> @the_artkeep He played 0. he didn't like it
[4:17:04] <%Adwark> @The_Artkeep I think they touched on Yakuza games on one of doobs birthday streams, but that was very much not Max style of game.
[4:17:05] <%leith_aziz> @The_Artkeep He only streamed 0, but didn't really enjoy it. It's a shame as he didnt even get to Majima
[4:17:07] <tacticalnuke002> @jonrskittles He got the car keys and got the true ending

[4:19:46] <%RofflessLWK> @leith_aziz For me it was Akiyama, but that's because I have a bias for him as he's my favourite Yakuza character :p

[4:21:22] <%RofflessLWK> @llllovetttt They just want to try something different, I guess. Now we have 2 different combat styles in both Yakuza and Judgement series, best of both worlds imo!

[4:21:55] <%leith_aziz> @NicoB7700: Considering how much you talked about your history with VF, I hope you've been enjoying VF5.
[4:21:58] <OptimusCack> 66p+k is also good for stopping lei-fei counter stances
[4:22:00] <+ilcavo93> @maximilian_dood how is the netcode?
[4:22:05] <%DinoPulseZeta> @Viewtifulotaku7 doodWat
[4:22:07] <AlteredScotsman> @the_vengeful I mean, maybe. But managing all the stance switches to mix your opponent is not easy.
[4:22:07] <%juan1_2_3> Judo
[4:22:09] <%juan1_2_3> PogChamp
[4:22:12] <DSD24> Its yah boi Goh

[4:22:19] <@NicoB7700> @leith_aziz it's been great, so happy to have VF back nicobProud

[4:22:26] <%leith_aziz> Matrix Goh?
[4:22:26] <+Nettacki> Edgy Judo guy
[4:22:27] <%Bedskirts> wow. two Neos in a row
[4:22:33] <+freddursty> Is Jean male or female
[4:22:37] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @RadicalHighway cirBox
[4:22:40] <%SquallAdv> classic VF UI and VF2 music is the perfect combo for VF5 <3
[4:22:41] <%Adwark> @NEONTIG3R Exactly like that. Though if you're setting up just 2 person room, you can also use to sort rooms by available amount of players in room to make it easier
[4:22:43] <unknlai> shaolin kungfu is actually created in 1980s. XD
[4:22:45] <%Juicebox_FGC> It's WESKER
[4:22:46] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @freddursty Male
[4:22:46] <%Kalzassa> @illTemperedSeaBass sadly no. The delay based it has is some of the best delay based, but still isn't as good as roll back of course.
[4:22:47] <+L3m0nTwi5t> Let's Goh bois
[4:22:49] <%Baljhet> Jean's a dude.
[4:22:51] <ChaoticSphere> melsorrrCry2
[4:22:55] <+SimonorSMTHNG> who are good secondaries for having goh as your main?
[4:22:58] <TheChapyGuy> hey chat or Max, what's the verdict on the netcode? beunis or no beunis?
[4:22:58] <Zharvane> its a goon Pog
[4:23:00] <stacks717> This Goh looks straight outta the Matrix
[4:23:04] <frosty_frozon> @freddursty he french
[4:23:04] <%MikeyJC> You can duck the second hit of that Goh string btw
[4:23:06] <%DedlokPM> @Viewtifulotaku7 octoGun pixcatGat rooGun
[4:23:10] <@Viewtifulotaku7> !vf5 @TheChapyGuy
[4:23:10] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[4:23:11] <%XionBarzhad> notkohHuh Does Goh have the Kazuya chest scar?
[4:23:12] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> @freddursty male, he's from the same assassin group as Goh
[4:23:12] <illTemperedSeaBass> @Kalzassa Sadness.
[4:23:17] <+Linoir> Jean is just a pretty dude.
[4:23:21] <%skynja> @freddursty you can see his tits, so obviously Male doodDerp
[4:23:22] <@Nightbot> Watch our YoVideogames stream archives on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/yovideogames
[4:23:26] <NEONTIG3R> there NEEDS to be an invite system or a better way for friends to join, hopefully SEGA takes note
[4:23:32] <DSD24> Man Goh is pissed
[4:23:34] <%RadicalHighway> foot punch!
[4:23:38] <%The_Vengeful> @AlteredScotsman His ease of execution is what makes him easy, and, again, there's a lot to remember with Lei, but that wasn't my point
[4:23:41] <8mmspikes> Goh has some savage throws
[4:23:48] <zhuravli> Goh is like a guy who would be disqualified from olympics judo LUL
[4:23:54] <@Viewtifulotaku7> I still think Judo is one if the more scariest fighting styles.
[4:23:56] <%Wolfenwar> This looks like one of the maps in Rainbow Six Siege doodLUL
[4:24:04] <%leith_aziz> @NicoB7700: Glad to hear that. I know you might not be used to it, but I wouldn't mind if you wanted to stream your time playing VF5 or Strive. Don't know about the rest of the penguins.
[4:24:04] <TheChapyGuy> @Viewtifulotaku7 Thank you!
[4:24:06] <GrandchampReborn> Is goh the command grab dude of VF?
[4:24:11] <%juan1_2_3> Judo grabs man
[4:24:12] <%Baljhet> Muay Thai scares me more.
[4:24:13] <%philosovitamin> this is definitely one of the better gohs I've seen so far
[4:24:13] <%The_Vengeful> Not 'easy' but 'easier' to correct myself
[4:24:19] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @GrandchampReborn That would be Wolf.
[4:24:23] <%Man_in_the_Red> is there anyone else in the genre that fights dirtier than Goh or Yamazaki
[4:24:31] <%TheRedViper_x> do we know if this is the esports virtua fighter game they announced a while ago
[4:24:32] <+Linoir> Dural has to be banned online. That or somehow max hasn't run into any people trying to cheese out wins in online play with boss character
[4:24:32] <+ttbeezy> are there counters in this?
[4:24:34] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Man_in_the_Red Bryan Fury.
[4:24:37] <@NicoB7700> @leith_aziz LUL we'll see, gotta consider my audience
[4:24:38] <kobura57> lol
[4:24:38] <%UnluckySpade7> @grandchampreborn no that would be wolf hawkfield
[4:24:41] <%XionBarzhad> @Viewtifulotaku7 I would probably only place Muay Thai higher just cause its is basically designed to kill.
[4:24:41] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @ttbeezy Some characters do have that.
[4:24:41] <Leodash_> goh has that dragunov punch
[4:24:42] <%leith_aziz> @Man_in_the_Red Balrog?
[4:24:42] <%RadicalHighway> hit into grab wow
[4:24:45] <PKcritical> that double roll, what a chad
[4:24:46] <%Baljhet> Dural isn't playable.
[4:24:47] <kefka_himself> judo like og wrestling
[4:24:49] <elementor374> Judo is all about grabs and throws
[4:24:51] <+dadranmeover> wow goh looks fun
[4:24:52] <Hericknhx> @Viewtifulotaku7 yeah, I getting judo throw in anytigh that's not tatami would hurt alot LUL
[4:24:56] <%Juicebox_FGC> @GrandchampReborn He has many grabs, but also a few defensive counters. He also has a unique mechanic, he can "counter" a succesful throw against him (requires a nearly frame-perfect input)
[4:24:57] <%JIVEB0T> @Linoir You can't use her
[4:24:59] <%UnluckySpade7> @linoir you cannot play dural at all
[4:25:00] <%Adwark> @Linoir It's "esports" version, I'm not sure if you can even select Dural at all LUL
[4:25:02] <+Nettacki> @linoir Dural isn’t playable in this game at all
[4:25:03] <bluerbobo> @NicoB7700 i'd watch
[4:25:05] <unknlai> wow, roll?
[4:25:06] <%Kitsune826> judo's not the most practical in terms of martial arts, really weak when it comes to ground game
[4:25:07] <TheChapyGuy> I really like the classic UI
[4:25:07] <Blue_Dedication> try up down up down left right A B start for fatality
[4:25:10] <@TiffanyLockheart> OKAYYY MAX
[4:25:12] <WinterwolfSC> @Linoir dural isn't even playable, what are you talking about? LUL
[4:25:12] <%SquallAdv> naisu <3
[4:25:15] <@TiffanyLockheart> THAT COME BACK tiffosMaxW
[4:25:16] <pregoparafuso> Does Dural have her own moveset?
[4:25:17] <%SteelaiRizel> I kinda want to see you play as Goh Max, you gonna?
[4:25:20] <%RadicalHighway> cool fight
[4:25:20] <+LowHighKang> Goh does dirty judo
[4:25:23] <GrandchampReborn> Aight thanks Chat!
[4:25:25] <DSD24> I wish they subtitled the characters
[4:25:26] <%TokenBlackDood> this Gohnis not too bad at all
[4:25:28] <%yvnggodtezzo> the infamous point
[4:25:38] <+Linoir> That makes complete sense. Dural playable in this version wouldn't work. Maybe as DLC down the line lol
[4:25:43] <iheartmota> yea stream @NicoB7700 VF5 play with us
[4:25:44] <llllovetttt> this dural is vanessa
[4:25:45] <@NicoB7700> Dural is a mish mash of various other characters
[4:25:47] <+Coltaine44> isnt Dural using other peoples moves?
[4:25:54] <+kohakune> @Man_in_the_Red I mean if we're talking not exclusively to hand to hand, BB Hood is all about "accidental" murder
[4:25:54] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @XionBarzhad Well yeah, Muay Thai focuses on the elbows and knees which are already hard enough on their own, but applying them to force usually means something is breaking and is just scary.
[4:25:54] <%XionBarzhad> I think Dural's basic stance might have some unique moves, but outside of that stance, its just mokujin
[4:25:59] <%MikeyJC> Dural is not e-sports
[4:26:00] <@TiffanyLockheart> Unsure if spoiler or not. @Jonrskittles
[4:26:02] <%The_Derkman> The_Derkman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[4:26:02] <elementor374> there goes that dude lol, got shot
[4:26:04] <bluerbobo> goh is so cool, i might pick him when i get the game
[4:26:19] <industry_> i really want to see max get to 1st dan
[4:26:23] <+ttbeezy> dural is Seth on cocane
[4:26:23] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> @linoir Preferably nerfed so that Dural players don't cheese others out.
[4:26:25] <%leith_aziz> This man is good at stepping
[4:26:26] <AlteredScotsman> @the_vengeful Yeah, I can understand that. Just feel like characters like Jean, Jacky and Pai are easier. But maybe Lei Fei is just as easy.
[4:26:27] <%Adwark> @Jonrskittles He did get that ending with car keys, that much I can guarantee ya
[4:26:30] <%cgpd777> cgpd777 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! how's it going
[4:26:31] <%OverpoweredYeti> Can you get anythkng out of roll
[4:26:34] <%tomikaze_> oki doki
[4:26:39] <+LowHighKang> Goh is SUPER fun to play as
[4:26:44] <kjm780211> Kreygasm
[4:26:45] <+Linoir> yeah dural kinda just fuses a bunch of peoples moves in one character, which makes her combo game kind of completely a broken joke. her combos have combos.
[4:26:46] <Jonrskittles> @tiffanylockheart nah it ain't, I would t consider it since there's something that eludes to it early on
[4:26:49] <%OmegafuzzTV> Harada is in this game?
[4:26:55] <ShinKensou> oh wow the classic hud is dope
[4:27:05] <bluerbobo> i really like how slow and brutal goh is
[4:27:12] <%Juicebox_FGC> @OverpoweredYeti Goh's roll is only a roll, it has no followups or attacks. Does go under highs, at least.
[4:27:13] <@shinkuhadoken1> Cant sleep, must watch this Jean some more 😂
[4:27:16] <+Coltaine44> will this game be at EVO?
[4:27:16] <%leith_aziz> Oh, hi Kensou
[4:27:17] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Oh no it's Goh
[4:27:22] <Leodash_> So, dural is MMA?
[4:27:26] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Goh is sick as fuck ngl
[4:27:35] <%leith_aziz> @Coltaine44 With it's online? I dont know man
[4:27:39] <%Delevara> @Maximilian_DOOD try hitting guard/block in the middle of the movement  to reset your inputs? Maybe that would work better?
[4:27:39] <Blue_Dedication> since VF5US just came out, does this mean we'll have to wait another 10 years for VF6?
[4:27:43] <kefka_himself> @coltaine44  probably yes
[4:27:44] <+pfg_bear> What does the little star mean
[4:27:47] <@TiffanyLockheart> There's a lot of ways to be a spoiler hun. Just playing it safe. @Jonrskittles Please don't talk about it again.
[4:27:48] <+Linoir> @TargetmasterHotRodimus This would be the best way to do it, yes.
[4:27:51] <$therealdondoffy> @maximilian_dood you're not gonna try ff7 first soldier? is already out to play

[4:28:57] <@TiffanyLockheart> SourPls
[4:29:05] <shadow_doogie> jean looks like a silver haired max
[4:29:05] <Hericknhx> one thing I like about Goh is that he usually Judo is something a chill and honorable character would use, but he being an punk is a great twist LUL
[4:29:06] <%Adwark> @iheartmota Huh, what's coming out in early September? 🤔
[4:29:08] <%TheRedViper_x> doesnt ff7r and gg strive release on the same day?? i wonder what hes gonna do for that

[4:39:39] <%SA_Zeph> @SA_Zeph I still enjoy the idea of them, just not the weird de-syncs that happen, and a third of the screen being a UI that nobody cares about  doodBait

[4:39:47] <%Kitsune826> how many times do we have to keep teaching you this lesson old man?!
[4:39:49] <%Lemmythebest> shun is kinda wacky
[4:39:56] <%Adwark> @Billiesan If I recall right, old VFs music is part of customization DLC
[4:39:58] <%Bedskirts> @Billiesan in the options with the dlc you can replace the music to like 100 different songs, including VFKids
[4:39:59] <%Kalzassa> @VZLABoi sure why not...you to.. happythoComfy
[4:40:00] <%DinoPulseZeta> @Man_in_the_Red How are you excited for StrIVe and being sarcastic about the Lobbies when the Lobbies suck? It's just the truth! most things else are good, but the LOBBIES. The DARN LOBBIES
[4:40:01] <@shinkuhadoken1> @shinkensou I would agree with you, I played for a few solid hours in ranked with “good” connections but they were all great for me tonight.
[4:40:08] <computer_321> @Billiesan there is music from all the VF games as well as retro costumes if you buy the full game(DLC
[4:40:16] <kobura57> nice
[4:40:16] <%Snugglesz> is this game on pc?
[4:40:17] <iheartmota> that shun is too sober
[4:40:22] <%VZLABoi> 🍺  SabaPing
[4:40:22] <%Jflaskd13> still cool
[4:40:23] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Snugglesz No.
[4:40:25] <%SquallAdv> yeah, the DLC includes the OSTs from all VFs
[4:40:26] <@Viewtifulotaku7> !vf5
[4:40:26] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[4:40:29] <%Brunty023> @Brunty023 True! I mean, we're getting him dancing in Lost Judgment. Good enough to fill our missing karaoke gap
[4:40:31] <Baritone_Baphomet> Strive lobbies were pretty ass tbh
[4:40:31] <%surpriseparty20> I would defo play Shun if I was gonna play VF5  . He looks so fun and stupid doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[4:40:32] <stacks717> @ShinKensou chillin chillin. Still haven't gotten my VF5 fill as you can see haha
[4:40:33] <%Man_in_the_Red> @dinopulsezeta and? i wont be using them so thats a you problem
[4:40:33] <Leodash_> Is there any other fighting games like this, like no meter or comeback mechanic, just straight up sparring?
[4:40:33] <elementor374> !vf5
[4:40:38] <%leith_aziz> @SA_Zeph I like the ranking system in terms of the towers personally. I don't even hate the aethetic of the lobbies or anything, they're just too clunky and waste too much ti,e
[4:40:40] <Daldondo> nah man its impressive how far you've come
[4:40:41] <%sifu_phatdragon> always remember KISS = keep it simple stupid
[4:40:43] <%leith_aziz> *time
[4:40:43] <The_Artkeep> did they also remake the animations because for an old game, stuff looks smooth af LUL
[4:40:45] <%TheRedViper_x> whats the difference between type a and type b
[4:40:49] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Leodash_ DoA
[4:40:54] <tacticalnuke002> Shun needs to drink to unlock his moveset and this man isn't drinking enough
[4:40:57] <FacelessAFK> Seinfeld ass bassline LUL
[4:41:03] <+Otsgekee> @Maximilian_DOOD VF5US worked quite well on PS now in training mode only problem is that the image quality is not that crisp all the time.
[4:41:08] <FlowLethal> Sober shun mains
[4:41:09] <ShinKensou> @leith_aziz I hear ya, it's not perfect but it's a really solid solution for the absence of rollback kensouYe
[4:41:11] <@shinkuhadoken1> LUL @facelessafk
[4:41:13] <BazaltF4> @TheRedViper_x just different costumes
[4:41:14] <%DinoPulseZeta> @Man_in_the_Red How you gonna be playing online Multiplayer then?
[4:41:15] <%SquallAdv> @Viewtifulotaku7 DoA has supers now tho ;)
[4:41:17] <%XionBarzhad> @Viewtifulotaku7 Eh, DoA kind of has funky specials. Teleporting ninjas and such.
[4:41:20] <%Man_in_the_Red> shun di does need to bait an approach with the drank
[4:41:20] <@Nightbot> Check out our latest merch! Shirts, posters, mugs and more - https://maxdood.tv/merch
[4:41:23] <Kobukson> doesn't know how to drink to unlock more moves it seems
[4:41:34] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @XionBarzhad He asked with meter.
[4:41:39] <%juan1_2_3> ies def a PS4 game running at 1080p
[4:41:41] <elementor374> @leodash_ Dead or Alive, it got lots boobas tho
[4:41:48] <OptimusCack> my experiences with the online in this version are pretty bad. the big thing is if you have a good connection with someone, that's great, but if you don't have a good connection it sucks
[4:41:49] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> LUL
[4:41:50] <%SA_Zeph> @SA_Zeph For sure, weird desyncs and getting kicked out if you or your opponent promo/demote.  Mehhhh.  Still jonesing hard for it
[4:41:50] <@shinkuhadoken1> We all wish for rollback but this solution is ok with me.  Hopefully it helps they plan and give us rollback in the future
[4:41:51] <%UnluckySpade7> @the_artkeep nope same animations from final showdown
[4:41:55] <%Man_in_the_Red> its so fast you could use it point blank and not get punished in this delay
[4:41:55] <%leith_aziz> @Man_in_the_Red The lobbies are annoying, but they aint gonna stop me from playing the game. Especially with its rollback
[4:41:56] <Vulcan422> Classic UI and music is SICK
[4:41:58] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @SquallAdv Good point.
[4:42:03] <RialKiki_O7> Kick in in the diack
[4:42:06] <Baritone_Baphomet> Reformed alcoholic shun is only practices the 12 steps
[4:42:06] <%Adwark> @The_Artkeep Actually, animations is one of famous aspects of Virtua Fighter back in the days, so I'm quite sure they didn't even had to LUL
[4:42:14] <cbprophet> Will VF be on PC at some point?
[4:42:22] <ShinKensou> @shinkuhadoken1 right on fam that's dope

[4:43:22] <@Nightbot> Watch our YoVideogames stream archives on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/yovideogames
[4:43:26] <computer_321> is it true that rollback is harder to implement in 3D games, or is that just BS?
[4:43:29] <%Billiesan> you can break the one on Chun Li's staghe like in Fighting Vipers
[4:43:30] <OptimusCack> not a breakable fence on that stage. it's just cosmetic
[4:43:30] <pregoparafuso> What the hell is Jean saying at the end? Bonjin-kun?
[4:43:30] <+LowHighKang> Chat those are JoJo inspired win poses right?
[4:43:32] <cbprophet> i want to play it with my friend but he doesn't have a playstation.

[4:44:09] <%leith_aziz> @computer_321 There are more situations that the rollback has to predict in 3D games, but im not sure if its "harder"
[4:44:10] <industry_> dang this game has some sick music
[4:44:12] <%Bedskirts> this game has such good looking kicks. so meaty

[4:44:51] <HeihoochieMama> My Shun Di is trash chat
[4:44:54] <+VISlaaVIneshVI> It doesn't seem to have the ability to friend matchmake anyway. :( @cbprophet
[4:45:20] <+SuperKokuJin916> Sarah always had some of the best themes!  Her VF4 was great too!
[4:45:23] <%leith_aziz> @prettystardoll I think you have to pay for the cosumisation
[4:45:28] <+Robbo169> Has Max ever said why he doesnt have bttv on this channel?
[4:45:31] <%XionBarzhad> Aoi's robe drapes didn't seem to translate very well. They look odd to me.
[4:45:31] <%jacob_quenepa> nice
[4:45:33] <ShinKensou> lol aoi don't care if you lay down she's going to man handle you regardless lol

[4:45:42] <+Androgynos> EZ
[4:45:44] <+LowHighKang> Does VF2 have the best music of the series
[4:45:46] <GeltonZ> @prettystardoll At the moment yeah. VF5FS had a ton but they have to redo all the parts and so it's drastically downgraded for US at the moment. @leith_aziz And yes Max did pay for the customization.
[4:45:50] <%Man_in_the_Red> @prettystardoll its in a dlc pack for a 10er, but a good portion of the FS stuff's in it along with the soundtracks
[4:45:50] <+chaosformula6957> FeelsGoodMan
[4:46:06] <$shwez> yours
[4:46:07] <%Adwark> @Robbo169 Doesn't want non-PC users to feel excluded due to PC exclusive features of what I recall him mentioning that.

[4:46:41] <%ChaosedStar> it shows who at the bottom
[4:46:47] <GeltonZ> @Man_in_the_Red "A good portion" is a DRASTIC overstatement. There's barely anything in that pack.
[4:46:48] <%Kitsune826> aoi does look fun, so does goh
[4:46:51] <OptimusCack> aoi has cool counters and parries, but what really makes her shine are her sabakis
[4:47:01] <%XionBarzhad> There is definitely the Necro VF players but this is a good time to jump in for sure.
[4:47:08] <+Robbo169> @Adwark That's wack, but ok LUL
[4:47:09] <+mrcassidyart> damn mids
[4:47:16] <%ChaosedStar> Sabakis?

[4:47:22] <+LowHighKang> Goh is super fun Kitsune
[4:47:22] <ventoj> Aoi looks fun, this one doesn't seem to like the counters though
[4:47:40] <+KOOKIEZrYUM> no rank up :(
[4:47:42] <TargetmasterHotRodimus> All I can say is: Owie. I made another funny! Dohohohoho!
[4:47:45] <%Adwark> @Robbo169 Well Max has been doing shit his own way rather than following every twitch meta thing and it does work out for him nonetheless LUL
[4:47:47] <industry_> screw it i'll just admit it here, i've never won against an aoi
[4:47:48] <Leodash_> aoi uses that anji 5H move
[4:47:54] <%SquallAdv> doodThirst
[4:48:00] <iheartmota> Aoi has some good strings even without counters
[4:48:00] <+ttbeezy> she's like asaka with no flips
[4:48:04] <Rawrsong> @pregoparafuso   A half French/Japanese karate guy who got brainwashed into being an assassin
[4:48:08] <Urakarenn> Wait??? You can costumize the HUD too???
[4:48:12] <%leith_aziz> @Leodash_ Right! I see it now
[4:48:13] <+mrcassidyart> Chat, is this a good port?
[4:48:22] <@shinkuhadoken1> Yes @mrcassidyart
[4:48:22] <%Aidonis> Really fun seeing the Aikijutsu
[4:48:26] <agusper11> that dmg wtf
[4:48:27] <%Adwark> @Urakarenn DLC pack has Classic UI option.
[4:48:27] <+Deathmare_X> hows the gane
[4:48:30] <%leith_aziz> @mrcassidyart Based on what?
[4:48:33] <%SeanmanderPlays> Why does Aoi have jiggle physics and Vannessa got none ?
[4:48:33] <+Robbo169> @Adwark Can't deny you there
[4:48:35] <%loveselfloveall> Are the rankings Dan level 2 Ryu level one
[4:48:36] <zenith0111> Is that Virtua 1 Hud?
[4:48:41] <MomolueD> dang Aoi be JIGGLIN
[4:48:42] <$Coil_Twitch_Bot> cheer100
[4:48:42] <%SquallAdv> @mrcassidyart its a remaster with Yakuza engine, not a port
[4:48:44] <OptimusCack> sorry, "sabaki" is an old vf term. they're sort of like guardpoint attacks
[4:48:48] <bladbaby> can you change jean's hair to blonde?
[4:48:55] <taeko_ohnuki> right in the balls
[4:48:58] <+BlazingRush> This is SUCH A GOOD SONG
[4:49:00] <iheartmota> ay a counter
[4:49:08] <%SquallAdv> @zenith0111 yup, and VF2 music, it's all included in the DLC
[4:49:09] <%loveselfloveall> @deathmare_x the gane’s are fine how bout u
[4:49:13] <pregoparafuso> @Rawrsong Wait what he's french? That's wild
[4:49:16] <ventoj> @chaosedstar Sobaki is a mechanic that certain moves will almost beat(or eat) certain moves. Guard points to certain attacks
[4:49:19] <+Gabe_uf3> @OptimusCack tekken still uses that term iirc
[4:49:21] <+notori_osu> wake up mid is -3 on hit i think
[4:49:23] <%TokenBlackDood> He always mash attack on wakeup
[4:49:24] <+ttbeezy> yeah you can customize the characters I believe
[4:49:29] <%Adwark> @mrcassidyart Pretty damn good, only real flaws is aspect of lacking rollback and getting into one room with friends is an issue due to invite system lacking, but in terms of gameplay, it does do well apparently.
[4:49:40] <%ChaosedStar> Thanks dood! @OptimusCack @ventoj
[4:49:42] <Kobukson> jean is half french half japanese
[4:49:42] <$shwez> @bladbaby yeah you can, Max does have custom blonde Jean too

[4:49:50] <+BookOfSol> LUL
[4:49:50] <%leith_aziz> @Rawrsong Now he straight up sounds like a mix of Polnareff and Jotaro with the poses and everything
[4:49:57] <jinchuriki703> ranking up is hard for no reason
[4:50:03] <%Bholorak> probably counter hit
[4:50:05] <+mrcassidyart> @Adwark thanks! That's what I was wondering. :)

[4:54:30] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @RadicalHighway No.
[4:54:31] <%Kalzassa> @Yasuro82 Should be yeah since VF5 here is one of them for June and plenty of people are playing. Search for the game specifically on store if you can't find it.

[4:54:50] <%Kalzassa> @Kitsune826 happythoThumbsUp
[4:54:50] <%Lliimbo> @FarkyJ better than most delay based games, but nowhere near rollback still
[4:54:55] <%SteelaiRizel> Huh so Jean has Paul Phoenix's big punch but faster with less damage, nice.

[4:55:45] <%krystalcute91> @Urakarenn absorb netcode
[4:55:49] <%Kyle_Steen> Hey chat remind me, are there any Bruce Lee style characters in any anime fighters? Im having a hard time remembering
[4:55:50] <@shinkuhadoken1> @maximilian_dood you are doing really well with those charge attacks and the mix after!
[4:55:50] <%MitchEnigma> tthe mash

[4:56:07] <%SteelaiRizel> Holy hell that flip kick damage
[4:56:09] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @Kyle_Steen Jam in Guilty Gear.
[4:56:10] <tacticalnuke002> @kyle_steen You're looking at him
[4:56:13] <Myloe> it would have been so sick if they gave this game rollback instead of delay based netcode 🤣
[4:56:14] <%leith_aziz> @Kyle_Steen Jam from Guilty Gear
[4:56:18] <@shinkuhadoken1> @evilmajikman agree
[4:56:23] <%leith_aziz> Also Chie from Persona 4 Arena
[4:56:28] <%RadicalHighway> jesus christ Jacky is so cool doodCrazy
[4:56:29] <DoodTheKid> Jacky definitely looked better in Final Showdown lol
[4:56:34] <%Man_in_the_Red> @kyle_steen in anime fighters... Jam in guilty gear and Pai (?) in arcana hearts
[4:56:37] <zenith0111> Is Flip Kick plus on block? or is he getting lucky?
[4:56:41] <%kyokusanagi94> we kinda already knew about kof 15 being delayed, 1 or 2 characters per week in 50-60 character game
[4:56:42] <%AceOfTwitch> Man, Max, how do you feel about PSO2 on the 9th ?! D:

[4:57:23] <%Adwark> @Applecannon63 Does SF tho count as anime fighter? LUL I don't think so LUL
[4:57:24] <+chaosformula6957> ariW damn
[4:57:27] <%ChaosedStar> @Kyle_Steen Mhm, SF has Fei Long, Chie from persona 4, Jam from guilty gear, but Jan Lee is the most true to Lee imo.
[4:57:30] <%AceOfTwitch> Jean feels very much like Jin, no? And Jacky a bit close to Law?
[4:57:31] <lordlord07> niiice
[4:57:32] <%Adwark> @Applecannon63 Sorry, KoF* LUL
[4:57:35] <+ChewyCookies> Dick punch
[4:57:38] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @zenith0111 It's suuuper minus but it can be weird to punish because he moves back during it I guess
[4:57:40] <+noizstar> is this for PC?
[4:57:41] <OoZoo70k> benimaru PogChamp
[4:57:42] <@shinkuhadoken1> Flip kick beats 2p that’s why.  It’s launchable on block tho
[4:57:43] <%SteelaiRizel> Given how much damage that flip kick does, might as well through it out at the start every time just in case lol
[4:57:46] <%ChaosedStar> @Kyle_Steen Jan Lee from DOA*
[4:57:47] <%SteelaiRizel> Jeezus
[4:57:48] <+JusticeSoulTuna> 66P is so satisfying. AY! evoRage
[4:57:52] <%stardustdood> This Jacky’s crazy flip kicking like cpu guile
[4:57:53] <%leith_aziz> @Adwark It kinda is actually. It's just that SF's artstyle is inconsistent as hell
[4:57:53] <Wartogh> PLAY WITH YOUR HEART
[4:57:53] <cbprophet> Jacky is not ganna have kids after this match  is over.
[4:57:54] <%Man_in_the_Red> Mei Fang, thats her name

[4:58:08] <martiansamurai> why did that flip do so much damage lmao
[4:58:09] <%Kitsune826> the flippies
[4:58:09] <%bustahwulf170> Counterhit Flash Kick is ABSURD.
[4:58:11] <lilherb504> gg
[4:58:11] <%Kyle_Steen> I dont how I forgot about Jam.
[4:58:13] <%Adwark> @noizstar PS4 only (with PS5 compatiblity)
[4:58:20] <Daldondo> counter hit flash is nuts
[4:58:26] <kobura57> Buff Jacky backflip
[4:58:31] <Akibared_> chadmuShred
[4:58:32] <Fironial> it's gotta be a full punish on block for that damage
[4:58:36] <%Kitsune826> i hope they put jam in gg strive as dlc
[4:58:40] <@shinkuhadoken1> It is
[4:58:40] <%Adwark> @leith_aziz Visually maybe, but then again within fighting games, "anime fighter" also does signify certain specific kind of gameplay.
[4:58:40] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> Man seeing people in the chat See Jacky's fucked up flash kick for the first time brings me life
[4:58:40] <OptimusCack> flip kicks are super punishable but you have to dash in to do anything
[4:58:41] <+noizstar> @Adwark Ok thanks man

[4:58:48] <%SteelaiRizel> Hmm i wonder if i can rock this with PS NOW
[4:58:48] <%SquallAdv> VF2 Akira theme is CurseLit CurseLit RaccAttack
[4:58:50] <%bustahwulf170> ...Can we talk about how amazing Akira's theme is real quck?
[4:58:53] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> That flash kick has ruined more childhoods than world hunger
[4:58:55] <%ChaosedStar> @Kyle_Steen Law from Tekken and Lui Kang from MK as well
[4:58:55] <ventoj> 50%? Nooooooo 35%
[4:59:01] <industry_> is the netcode better than tekken 7?
[4:59:03] <%Man_in_the_Red> @steelairizel you can
[4:59:08] <%ichujun> Akira monkaS
[4:59:09] <%leith_aziz> @Kitsune826 I heard they wanna put every character from GG in Strive in the future if possible
[4:59:20] <pregoparafuso> I love this Akira costume
[4:59:24] <+kohakune> @SquiglyBattleOpera Yea, but it's gotten to the point Granblue Vs is a "anime fighter" when its more traditional than SFV.
[4:59:28] <%krystalcute91> @industry_ max said absorb netcode
[4:59:28] <%deathspit00> Flash Kick is good but risky. If it wiffs that's your ass.
[4:59:28] <@shinkuhadoken1> Your training with me will pay off here!!
[4:59:35] <Rawrsong> Justice for Bridget!
[4:59:35] <%SteelaiRizel> @Man_in_the_Red Oh dam, well i know what im doing then
[4:59:37] <+ChewyCookies> When in danger crouch jab

[4:59:39] <Kaio_Ken1989> Akira hard af 4 me to use
[4:59:45] <%Kalzassa> @industry_ delay based just like it is, but seems to be better from overall from what has been observed.
[4:59:50] <thinkidinks> oof the stutters
[4:59:50] <mouthfullofrice> PogChamp
[4:59:54] <%ChaosedStar> When Akira works he wooorks
[4:59:59] <%XionBarzhad> Training amounts for nothing when faced with overwhelming Delay bawkDoit
[5:00:01] <elementor374> oof i can see the delay
[5:00:02] <+Applicationking> why is jean so tall anyway
[5:00:03] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @kohakune ??? I think you responded to the wrong person lol
[5:00:05] <%Kitsune826> @leith_aziz that'd be amazing, used to play testament many moons ago
[5:00:06] <OptimusCack> akira takes some planning ahead due to the nature of his inputs
[5:00:08] <%Say_No_to_Weebs_> Ryu vs VIOLENT KEN atpRtsuspectd
[5:00:09] <zenith0111> I like how that sweep kick had a jet sound effect
[5:00:12] <@shinkuhadoken1> For me, Akira is the ultimate reward in this game
[5:00:13] <dramaa216> do you plan on playing the fighting game with snoop dogg in it
[5:00:13] <mimikyu59> that read tho
[5:00:15] <kobura57> wifi from Brazil Kappa
[5:00:16] <%bustahwulf170> @sn0wcie I dunno if I'd call Akira a "Ryu".
[5:00:19] <%BeatdownGG> Embrace your inner UMVC3
[5:00:30] <Profmcstevie> What can men doing against such relentless input delay
[5:00:31] <+AyupaPupa> become absorbed into the netcode
[5:00:31] <%titanium_kyle> the blue/red outfit has always been so much better on Akira than the white one imo
[5:00:32] <%Adwark> @kohakune Well... such is internet, twisting up definition from one into another...
[5:00:35] <JUJUxANONY> parries are so satisfying
[5:00:38] <%XionBarzhad> There honestly isn't a Ryu character in VF that I can see
[5:00:39] <%leith_aziz> @Kitsune826 Let's hope (just don't put in Kliff pls Arcsys)
[5:00:40] <%ChaosedStar> @Applicationking cause he is French vs Japanese or Chinese.
[5:00:42] <Daldondo> @maximilian_dood neutral jump attack wake up lows
[5:00:43] <+Altair3333> @Kaio_Ken1989 Akira is like mishima from T7. Very hard to use, but basic gameplan

[5:02:38] <OptimusCack> no. if the character is on the box art he/she has to have a dp, some kind of flying kick, and a projectile. no exceptions
[5:02:39] <%bustahwulf170> @skynja That's the Japanese name for it, but it's a style of Kung Fu.
[5:02:41] <%Say_No_to_Weebs_> RollForward Stepping atpRtsuspectd
[5:02:41] <%leith_aziz> @SleepyNingyo Akira
[5:02:42] <%Adwark> @leith_aziz That being said, he's probably would get rebalanced to fit into game LUL
[5:02:42] <zenith0111> Avoiding the absorb frames
[5:02:46] <%Kyle_Steen> But thanks chat Jams kinda what I was trying to remember
[5:02:48] <tamerlanethegreat> Max is improving fast!
[5:02:51] <theGameFriendtv> they say akira is the hardest character to learn
[5:02:53] <%skynja> @bustahwulf170 right
[5:02:55] <mimikyu59> 2-0 victory
[5:02:56] <%BeatdownGG> @SleepyNingyo probably the drunken boxer guy imo

[5:03:30] <%Man_in_the_Red> @optimuscack boy does mexico want a word with you
[5:03:36] <+kohakune> Akira for the irony of poster boy is actualy the hardest character. Pre-5, it was recommended you main SOMEONE ELSE for a year before daring to play Akira competitively
[5:03:36] <+LowHighKang> How come nobody uses Jeffry?
[5:03:38] <%bustahwulf170> This Aoi tho.
[5:03:38] <dreadxkeeper> A o e LuL
[5:03:40] <%Bholorak> D:
[5:03:40] <%Kitsune826> dead
[5:03:41] <Applecannon63> Bajiquan/Hakkyokuken is simply Kungfu with Taich elements
[5:03:43] <%SleepyNingyo> thanks guys
[5:03:48] <%RadicalHighway> jesus that grab
[5:03:50] <Daldondo> man Aoi players can bevtrouble
[5:03:53] <%leith_aziz> @Adwark: Eh, I don't mean balance wise. Kliff is the only character in GG I don't like. He just feels generic.
[5:03:58] <zenith0111> Why the damage so brutal
[5:03:59] <pscarnage> D: that grab holy fuck
[5:03:59] <EtherNigh> We got many vanessa yesterday, today we got aoi, both waifu bless us Kreygasm
[5:04:01] <+afroshouji> I fought that Aoi a little earlier, ha.
[5:04:10] <%bustahwulf170> @LowHighKang Because he's not quite as good as everyone else.
[5:04:12] <%Bholorak> you spell her name like A-OI
[5:04:13] <Harv88> is this game one of the monthly freebie games that you get to keep forever or do you have to have ps plus every month for access ?
[5:04:17] <tacticalnuke002> This Aoi should be named Kin lol
[5:04:21] <%Say_No_to_Weebs_> @LowHighKang weebs dont like... atpCarl atpCap

[5:04:29] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[5:04:29] <+ttbeezy> so when it shows the joystick 🕹Shake this a stagger?
[5:04:37] <Kaio_Ken1989> @Altair3333 i kinda see that yea lol, he felt very hard to use probably that hardest ive played with a character imo
[5:04:38] <m0h4mmed02> CHICAGO PUNISH
[5:04:43] <Applecannon63> Vanessa's Mocap is motherfucking Asuka!
[5:04:43] <%AceOfTwitch> Can you switch the HUD? It looks Retro, which is great! But, considering the game aesthetics it seems weird for this to be default
[5:04:49] <%krystalcute91> @tacticalnuke002 aoi means blue of her name
[5:04:54] <%Kitsune826> it'd be sporting if you did though
[5:04:55] <Daldondo> @bholorak actually pronounced OWIE though
[5:04:56] <Profmcstevie> The power of the jump in kick has been noted
[5:04:57] <%bustahwulf170> Yeah no, Jeffrey is LEGIT bottom tier.
[5:05:09] <%BeatdownGG> @AceOfTwitch nah we good chief doodGood
[5:05:20] <Rawrsong> @AceOfTwitch   The retro UI, sound effects, and music are a DLC option
[5:05:21] <%XionBarzhad> @AceOfTwitch It's not the default
[5:05:22] <tacticalnuke002> @krystalcute91 Yes and Kin means gold

[5:05:26] <%leith_aziz> I don't like stun mechanics where you have to shake the joystick
[5:05:27] <%LinkSOB> @aceoftwitch he changed to that on purpose
[5:05:33] <ShiroiTenshii> @AceOfTwitch its not the default
[5:05:34] <%SquiglyBattleOpera> @AceOfTwitch You can switch the HUD. THe retro HUG Max has on is a bonus that youy get for purchasing the legendary edition DLC, it's not the default
[5:05:38] <Ichykin> They be wiggleing
[5:05:40] <3dRes> Wiggle waggle dayJ
[5:05:54] <JDtG_Twitch> I honestly prefer this to the default ui
[5:06:01] <%AceOfTwitch> Ahh, gotya! Sorry, I just realised that it seems I might have implied that I wanted it changed, which I by no means want / would ask aceoftLul I love it
[5:06:06] <dreioo> haha Jean btfo
[5:06:07] <%Kitsune826> @leith_aziz not a fan of snapping your stick?
[5:06:08] <%bustahwulf170> OK, why the fuck does Aoi have Fujin?
[5:06:21] <+ttbeezy> the grabs on this game are animated so well
[5:06:24] <kobura57> Max Jean has a charge punch for the ground game if the player doesn't techroll
[5:06:28] <zenith0111> Those back blocks

[5:13:54] <%leith_aziz> @MadcatMK6 There are so many possibilities due to the date. GG character, KOF character, VF, Tekken, etc
[5:13:58] <KTGoggins> @thesilverhelix Yes it is
[5:14:04] <%wickedsupernova> doodHokey
[5:14:09] <%leith_aziz> I'm either expecting a GG or KOF character for the 5th
[5:14:12] <%lucarionite135> @maximilian_dood Are there any other UI and music customization settings? Or just vf5 and vf2? Cuz this ones dope
[5:14:12] <pscarnage> D:

[5:15:16] <%TokenBlackDood> Hype
[5:15:17] <+kohakune> @chaosgodkhornes Judgment's MC has Tiger and Crane. But that's a beat em up RPG like most pre-7 Yakuza.
[5:15:18] <%Adwark> @justabot9696 No - it's classic UI from DLC
[5:15:18] <Daldondo> Good shit lion be tricky

[5:15:27] <%SuperKamiiGuru> How have the connections been tonight?
[5:15:36] <EtherNigh> @the_grand_sc karate
[5:15:41] <machriphi> @GreaterDogFR Well, it's a HD remaster that came out in 2021.  Tekken 7 came out in 2015.
[5:15:47] <justabot9696> @Adwark looks preety good
[5:15:48] <%BeatdownGG> @GreaterDogFR idk about that for one, and this was remade to look this nice, t7 has been out for like 5-6 years outside of arcades
[5:15:51] <%yeknomlive> it's jerry bogard
[5:15:57] <%XionBarzhad> I prefer the visuals of T7 honestly. But I don't deny the animations are much better here.
[5:16:00] <%wickedsupernova> you kneed him in the ass
[5:16:03] <%leith_aziz> @SuperKamiiGuru For today, pretty good. Yesterday it was very mixed. I still feel like we need more tests
[5:16:03] <OptimusCack> i'm pretty sure i used to play this guy online back in the final showdown days
[5:16:06] <Rawrsong> @Zcanzer Other way around,  Lion predates Christie
[5:16:25] <Daldondo> This Lion wake up lows almost every time
[5:16:29] <%BeatdownGG> @Zcanzer everything you see in DOA came from VF
[5:16:39] <+Bofa_D_Snuts> this stage music bangs
[5:16:41] <DoodTheKid> Lion's voice acting is unmatched
[5:16:44] <%bustahwulf170> God, that boot-kick looks satisfying to land.
[5:16:46] <chaosgodkhornes> @kohakune Didn't know about but cool information
[5:16:47] <sodush> Only thing that VF didn't do first is sumo character in 3D fighters I think
[5:16:51] <Applecannon63> Lion is like Yun and Yang combined
[5:16:52] <Zcanzer> bruh i know
[5:16:55] <bagoosh> those delay counter hits are so sick
[5:16:59] <Shinji10TH> Weirdo bullying another Weirdo, what a great matchup LuL
[5:17:01] <%ChaosedStar> @XionBarzhad hell yeah dood, haven't thought about that game in a hot minute loved it to bits when i was a kid.
[5:17:02] <%XionBarzhad> Most 3D fighters spawned out of VF
[5:17:03] <%Kitsune826> you'd think after he gets punished like 20 times for the low wakeups he'd stop
[5:17:10] <%leith_aziz> Language!
[5:17:11] <Kaio_Ken1989> lol

[5:17:25] <%Shingo_snake> those knockdown kicks are brutal OhMyDog OhMyDog
[5:17:26] <+kohakune> Outside Sumo and Karate. nearly everything in VF came before Tekken and DOA. Even character custom
[5:17:28] <zezima133> niceee
[5:17:29] <Cman70> the damage
[5:17:29] <BlueBloodBlues> gg
[5:17:34] <%BeatdownGG> @XionBarzhad of course for the most generalized statement ever.  but DOA shares movesets with VF on that jacker tip
[5:17:38] <%Kalzassa> happythoLUL
[5:17:39] <sn0wcie> gg
[5:17:39] <JDtG_Twitch> VF was the first 3d fighter, everything started there

[5:17:51] <%BeatdownGG> @XionBarzhad go through Kages move list, then go through Ryu Hayabusa
[5:17:54] <chaosgodkhornes> Which character that hard to master on VF?
[5:18:03] <Kobukson> it feels so rewarding doesn't it?
[5:18:03] <kobura57> Sumo in VF is since VF3

[5:19:36] <Wiiplayah43> @kusanagimotoko100 people keep saying the netcode is decent, don't be a hardliner
[5:19:38] <%Seganite> @Omegaunicorn0114 Thank you man! :D
[5:19:39] <%BeatdownGG> @XionBarzhad especially considering they even share similar grav physics
[5:19:42] <SwindleDF> ouch
[5:19:43] <waggylads> Hey max what is some of the first fighting games you would teach to Ripley when she’s old enough to learn
[5:19:43] <%machine_head> @martiansamurai sega thought luchadore and leprechaun were the same thing
[5:19:46] <EtherNigh> @blackmissile max just fought 3 different aoi
[5:19:47] <%yeknomlive> el blaze seems fun
[5:19:48] <%Murgurth> Lmao
[5:19:51] <%TokenBlackDood> I bet this dude RQ
[5:19:57] <kobura57> WAW
[5:20:01] <%UnluckySpade7> @martiansamurai el blaze is small because Rey Mysterio is small LUL
[5:20:02] <%krystalcute91> doodLUL
[5:20:03] <DoodTheKid> I'VE GOT THE ADVANTAGE, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
[5:20:04] <Kaio_Ken1989> look at Maxs face lol
[5:20:04] <zezima133> dale con la silla rey
[5:20:07] <%Kitsune826> 20 leg punches later
[5:20:09] <%XionBarzhad> @BeatdownGG Never looked into it but wouldn't be surprised if some VF devs went to the DoA team. But they even had a bunch of VF characters show up in DoA 5 or 6.
[5:20:11] <Zcanzer> blaze is based of rey
[5:20:13] <+GreaterDogFR> Disgustang
[5:20:13] <Omegaunicorn0114> @TiffanyLockheart You're welcome!
[5:20:14] <%Man_in_the_Red> you'll never hit him, you'll never hit his tiny lil head
[5:20:14] <%skynja> @abigail_4_god_chickenfkr true. still, although I'm not certain on which one started the trend, SC games definitely have the most in depth customization
[5:20:14] <%bustahwulf170> That moment when you get kicked so hard you bounce off the floor and fall backwards.
[5:20:16] <cbprophet> almost every time max dies its from a low punch.
[5:20:16] <Harv88> Guys If you pre-order Guilty Gear Strive, do you get to play the game early before release date ?
[5:20:22] <%JackalJohnson> I don't know why but I hate El Blaze's voice actor.
[5:20:27] <garfield_fuel> same idle animation as El Fuerte though lmao
[5:20:27] <%UndeservingKonomichan> abbaLUL
[5:20:29] <+mariokarthero> raysQ
[5:20:29] <%ImCloutXaddyDuh> Rey Blaze does seem pretty fun tho lol
[5:20:35] <chaosgodkhornes> LUL That Lucha libre move
[5:20:37] <%Kitsune826> deluxe edition of gg strive is playable on the 8th i think
[5:20:38] <%Shingo_snake> El blaze reminds me to N fuego from thumb wrestling federation OhMyDog
[5:20:39] <frosty_frozon> @harv88 yeah, on 8th
[5:20:41] <+kusanagimotoko100> @Wiiplayah43 don't care, rollback o muerte.
[5:20:42] <%BeatdownGG> @XionBarzhad Matt McMuscles mentions it in the video he made on how Sega killed their fighting games
[5:20:42] <%Brunty023> @Harv88 Only if you were to preorder the Deluxe or Ultimate Editions
[5:20:44] <SwindleDF> The body splash in place LUL
[5:20:45] <Progearspec> yayyyyy
[5:20:45] <zenith0111> Hes adapting woolieSPICE
[5:20:46] <%leith_aziz> @Harv88 If you pre-order the Ultimate Edition, you can play it on the 8th
[5:20:47] <machriphi> @Harv88 Only if your preorder the deluxe/ultimate edition on PS4.  Base version or ANY PC version you do not.
[5:20:50] <%quique_schz> @Harv88 i think only in the most expensive edition
[5:20:50] <+oyanpi> suplex cith
[5:20:50] <%yeknomlive> @Harv88 it might have to be one of the special edition preorders
[5:20:53] <Wiiplayah43> @txcforever matches fine to me, and it's entertaining as hell
[5:20:56] <sodush> @Harv88 Only deluxe and ultimate editions get to play early and only console versions
[5:20:59] <%excannondrill> El Blaze seems so cool.
[5:21:04] <jarron42> @harv88 If you pre-order the deluxe edition digitally you get play early
[5:21:05] <OoZoo70k> I hope they keep the arcade sound design in 6
[5:21:06] <zezima133> woww
[5:21:08] <chrono_dono> @maximilian_dood sre you getting better with the evading?
[5:21:08] <%krystalcute91> wall jump lol
[5:21:09] <%TheKryptonian49> wtf lol
[5:21:09] <%XionBarzhad> @BeatdownGG Don't think I've watched that one. I'll need to take a look. In the "Wha Happened?" series right?
[5:21:10] <ThaddTheInhaler> I wish he would showcase the more grappling aspect of the blaze, but its still fun to watch.
[5:21:10] <%AceOfTwitch> What is your favorite fighting game so far, Max? KoF? Guilty Gear? VF?
[5:21:12] <pscarnage> monkaS
[5:21:13] <%ChaosedStar> are luchadores ever not cool?
[5:21:14] <%Kitsune826> blaaazed
[5:21:16] <Daldondo> He gave the control to big brother
[5:21:17] <Rawrsong> He's Flipping, stop him before he starts Dipping!
[5:21:17] <gradypogs> el fuerte/king PogChamp
[5:21:18] <sedated_kidd> 619!
[5:21:19] <%TokenBlackDood> That wall shit is crazy
[5:21:20] <kayosugoi> are u going pro max? XD
[5:21:21] <heero719> KomodoHype KomodoHype
[5:21:23] <kobura57> Low throws are also breakable
[5:21:26] <%BeatdownGG> @XionBarzhad Flophouse Files iirc
[5:21:26] <+kohakune> SC2 had custom characters but I think they only started doing original character custom around IV. Rival Schools and others had a character creator before, it's just that got retconned because they didn't wanna translate the dating sim story mode
[5:21:26] <%The_Vengeful> He has a pair of maracas on him just in case
[5:21:28] <%Man_in_the_Red> El Blaze seems to love high wall, any moves off the ropes/half wall
[5:21:29] <sn0wcie> BOOYAKA BOOYAKAAAA
[5:21:29] <+chaosformula6957> lol he's everywhere
[5:21:30] <%leith_aziz> I wish PC version of Strive had the other editions. I wouldn't mind suppourting the devs
[5:21:30] <%Ratchet446> 619
[5:21:31] <JDtG_Twitch> @chaosedstar el fuerte
[5:21:33] <Harv88> cool, thanks doods <3 SeemsGood <3
[5:21:35] <+ThePeoplesGamer1> booyaka
[5:21:37] <%Kitsune826> he's like vega lol
[5:21:42] <%bustahwulf170> @ChaosedStar El Fuerte from SF4.
[5:21:43] <%XionBarzhad> @BeatdownGG K I'll look into it.
[5:21:44] <journeymanapprentice> fuerte, ramon, el blaze Kreygasm
[5:21:49] <ImaKalel> Clap
[5:21:50] <%Kitsune826> jesus christ
[5:21:51] <DoodTheKid> He has mids off of the run as well
[5:21:52] <%skynja> @kohakune nah, 3 had customs
[5:21:53] <+GreaterDogFR> oof, those wall combos
[5:21:55] <fgc_splash> LETS GO SEPHIROTH!!!! claraaSmile
[5:21:55] <%titanium_kyle> @kohakune the first SC with a character creator was 3
[5:21:56] <+despera1> dem
[5:22:01] <zenith0111> This stage seems volatile
[5:22:02] <Last_Shinobi> do 9 G+K when he runs at you
[5:22:05] <%Shingo_snake> Maraca time
[5:22:08] <%DevilsLuckGaming> El Blaze came before El Fuerte and is the superior Luchador. There I said it.
[5:22:09] <%ChaosedStar> Whats wrong with El Fuerte?
[5:22:13] <%thewb32018> somehow I did not imagine the 619 sounding like thatLUL
[5:22:16] <mimikyu59> come on ray
[5:22:19] <%BeatdownGG> @XionBarzhad he goes into how Sega made like 6 fighting games in like 4 years or whatever and oversaturated themselves(VFs/Fighting Vipers/Megamix etc)
[5:22:20] <%The_Vengeful> Does Blaze have the lightest weight in the game?
[5:22:22] <chrono_dono> doods is the a more difficult 3d fighter to get into?
[5:22:24] <frosty_frozon> @leith_aziz but sony would mind if there is no special console edition

[5:22:28] <Wiiplayah43> @kusanagimotoko100 hardliners do nothing but make rollback advocates look obnoxious. chill out & learn to be flexible
[5:22:32] <%thewb32018> doodLUL
[5:22:34] <x_art_of_life_x> God, I love the back and forth in this game
[5:22:35] <OptimusCack> el blaze is 2nd lightest
[5:22:36] <machriphi> @DevilsLuckGaming Not really a hot take considering Fuerte is universally disliked
[5:22:39] <%wickedsupernova> doodBait
[5:22:39] <sn0wcie> wtf he ran around him like a little mouse LUL
[5:22:40] <%bustahwulf170> @ChaosedStar He was super lame and overpowered for a long time.
[5:22:42] <%ImCloutXaddyDuh> @thewb32018 voice sounds sooooo bad lol
[5:22:43] <+kohakune> @skynja @titanium_kyle Oh yea, you're right. Had KOSMOS as a secret cameo and everything. She had no fighting style unlike Devil Jin tho
[5:22:44] <%krystalcute91> !vf5
[5:22:44] <%yeknomlive> omg that looks amazing
[5:22:44] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[5:22:44] <+ttbeezy> El fuerte was my dude
[5:22:46] <jarron42> @the_vengeful Yes,He is the lightest character
[5:22:47] <%Kitsune826> lol
[5:22:48] <kayosugoi> did u punished that wake up low? i cant tell i only play tekken XD
[5:22:49] <Progearspec> El blaze lucha libre all over the place.
[5:22:54] <%Kitsune826> he's so weird  but fun looking
[5:22:57] <%DevilsLuckGaming> @ChaosedStar Nothing WRONG with him but he's a little too silly for my taste.
[5:23:01] <tamerlanethegreat> Look at Speedy Gonzales here!
[5:23:04] <zenith0111> Hes getting weird now aeroHeh
[5:23:11] <+kusanagimotoko100> @Wiiplayah43 sorry no, no flexibility, I like the game tho.
[5:23:11] <%WARWU1F> Been having a blast with this so far and got the DLC to do customizations so now i got like Trinity and Leon Kennedy looking attires for a couple characters LUL

[5:23:28] <fgc_splash> SOMEONE PLZ MAKE NACHO LIBRE WITH EL BLAZE STYLE GivePLZ
[5:23:29] <%XionBarzhad> @BeatdownGG Yeesh, haven't heard Fighting Vipers in years. But not surprising. I know for a while I definitely turned my brain off to any fighting game that wasn't Tekken or DoA cause was just too hard to keep up with all the clutter.
[5:23:30] <%BeatdownGG> ngl, that shin punch being super fast would annoy the living fuck out of me.  glad to be a spectator
[5:23:35] <%Shingo_snake> and it has similar moves like Ramon from KOF
[5:23:36] <justabot9696> this guy LUL
[5:23:37] <OptimusCack> he has a bunch of goofy movement stuff that's annoying to deal with until you have a lot of match-up knowledge
[5:23:41] <%Brunty023> Low Punches are so good! LUL
[5:23:47] <%DevilsLuckGaming> @machriphi Oh never claimed hot take but I felt better saying it outloud lol. Just a Big vf fan that's excited to see some love finally.
[5:23:48] <OoZoo70k> dick jab like it's mk
[5:23:49] <+blackmissile> Can you low punish or are all the lows too slow?
[5:23:50] <%GabuFGC> Max, are you going to explore other characters or are you going to main Jean until strive comes out?

[5:25:03] <%XionBarzhad> This guy is a lot more technical than Rey Mysterio realvrLUL Too much ground work and not enough flipping n dippin
[5:25:07] <%Brunty023> @Kobukson If only Bonesaw had a rare cameo in the stage
[5:25:15] <xFlySC> stop beating up that poor kid
[5:25:16] <kefka_himself> este no le llega ni a los talones a rey misterio

[5:25:43] <%Brunty023> @Gamerslasher2 Need to get the DLC
[5:25:44] <machriphi> @Gamerslasher2 Pay for it.
[5:25:48] <+kohakune> King is Tiger Mask, El Blaze was when Rey Mysterio was everyone's favorite underdog. Since The Rock and Stone Cold don't really have strict CQC.
[5:25:48] <+oyanpi> @kefka_himself esque rey misterio es rey misterio
[5:25:49] <JDtG_Twitch> Lowkey considering picking up blaze when I get the game

[5:26:27] <%Kitsune826> it was all a blur of denim
[5:26:28] <%xMr_Genesis> If you got it on PSN+ you gotta buy the DLC
[5:26:31] <Daldondo> He utilized the stage very well
[5:26:36] <%skynja> @leith_aziz you lucky EUers doodRage
[5:26:37] <%XionBarzhad> Yeah I think Blaze's VA is the only thing I don't like with the character. But a lot of the VA's seem weird to me.
[5:26:37] <BreadMakerCTM> are mids considered highs for el blaze? LUL
[5:26:41] <Gamerslasher2> Thanks Everyone! SeemsGood

[5:27:35] <adagio_gio> esports is the best fighting game
[5:27:36] <%BeatdownGG> HE'S STARTING TO BELIEVE

[5:28:41] <%ImCloutXaddyDuh> was that an ax kick to the back of the head? omg
[5:28:43] <%Tristar49> El Fuerte lookin ass running all over the place
[5:28:49] <+davidbloodycage> isn't this in yakuza 7?
[5:28:57] <%wickedsupernova> Is Jean the lovechild of Sephiroth and Ken?
[5:29:00] <%Brunty023> El Blaze is so much fun!
[5:29:02] <BreadMakerCTM> nice sidestep
[5:29:04] <DemiGodReviews> 15 year old game*
[5:29:05] <frosty_frozon> Just realised blaze has shakers on his hips
[5:29:09] <%BeatdownGG> Downloaded, sent to recycling bin
[5:29:10] <%Shingo_snake> dropkicks XD
[5:29:11] <%XionBarzhad> If I pick this game up, I might spend some time with Blaze. Always had a soft spot for Mysterio.
[5:29:13] <%Fatal_Fantom> I remember when I first played VF5. I mained El Blaze and enjoyed every second of it
[5:29:16] <BazaltF4> is max playing on a pad or stick?
[5:29:22] <enerkaizer> Jeans face has a lot of an uncanny valley effect in this version
[5:29:23] <%XionBarzhad> @davidbloodycage VF5 is. Not Ultimate/Final Showdown.
[5:29:24] <Progearspec> @hazy_v i'm sure it's for playing samba de amigo
[5:29:24] <%DevilsLuckGaming> Ken-irioth?
[5:29:25] <jarron42> @davidbloodycage The older version is. This is a new revamped version
[5:29:26] <DJ_is_Raiden> is sidestepping in vf like parrying in 3S?
[5:29:28] <JUJUxANONY> pad
[5:29:28] <%Bealy_beal> must not occur
[5:29:28] <TheChapyGuy> @davidbloodycage an older version without online play
[5:29:28] <%Brunty023> @davidbloodycage Well, the arcade VF5 is. Not this version
[5:29:28] <%bustahwulf170> @wickedsupernova He's more like if Ken was designed by Nomura.
[5:29:29] <kefka_himself> @maximilian_dood   NICELY done
[5:29:31] <%MrMidLife> @davidbloodycage pretty much. Yakuza 6 too.  This is remastered for online tho and it still rules :D
[5:29:37] <Gamerslasher2> Is it possible they can add new characters and update this new game?
[5:29:37] <elementor374> @bazaltf4 stick
[5:29:39] <Wiiplayah43> @davidbloodycage this is a remake of that game
[5:29:39] <+blackmissile> anyone else have a hard time with side step p+k+g attack in the tutorial?
[5:29:40] <+Brother_b_mo> Is the netplay good though?
[5:29:45] <%Kitsune826> stick
[5:29:47] <taken351> yeah :)
[5:29:50] <Applecannon63> @wickedsupernova Jean is more Remy but with Shotokan Karate
[5:29:55] <Jarabec_> If you were to compare this to another FG, what would people say this is like?
[5:29:57] <OptimusCack> it's vf5 final showdown in yakuza 6
[5:30:00] <+davidbloodycage> @wickedsupernova ken and dante. Kente, if you will. @XionBarzhad  @Brunty023 @Wiiplayah43  thanks for the clarification
[5:30:05] <DoodTheKid> Blaze is pretty fun, but Ireally have trouble with his reach (or lack thereof)
[5:30:06] <%DinoPulseZeta> @BazaltF4 Definitely a Stick based on the button sounds.
[5:30:11] <%LocalAlienParty> @davidbloodycage vf5fs is in a lot of yakuza and judgment games. but its solo arcade only. this is vf5us.
[5:30:11] <$CeeJayOrJustC> DOA
[5:30:16] <%thewb32018> Loving the classic VF music
[5:30:24] <%Kitsune826> damn that looked cool
[5:30:27] <FIGHTZONE_ITA> @OptimusCack 6 and 7 (Like a dragon) you can even playit stand alone via mods
[5:30:27] <DJ_is_Raiden> @Jarabec_ like vf
[5:30:33] <TioXyco> @wickedsupernova add a bit of JoJo in there (I mean... seems like Jean likes to poses and the surname) and we got Jean
[5:30:33] <%SleepyNingyo> waow
[5:30:35] <+kohakune> I still want that Akira RPG Shenmue was originally going to be
[5:30:36] <TheChapyGuy> @Jarabec_ Dead or Alive is the most direct comparison since they used to share the same engine for the original games
[5:30:40] <Gamerslasher2> @Jarabec_ Dead Or Alive
[5:30:41] <%yhmjack1> Jesus, he never stop hitting
[5:30:45] <mimikyu59> that was bad ass
[5:30:46] <%XionBarzhad> @Gamerslasher2 If anything they would just put the effort into a new game. Not a lot of point trying to revive a 9+ yr old game. They even released this for free with PS+ so I imagine they're trying to breed VF hype again.
[5:30:47] <sodush> You can open Xbox360 version of VF5FS in Yakuza with mods
[5:30:52] <Progearspec> waow !!
[5:30:55] <%MrMidLife> @Jarabec_ sounds like a cliche, but there's almost nothing else like this.  The closest comparison in terms of execution and defensive options os the KOF series.
[5:31:00] <+KOOKIEZrYUM> @Gamerslasher2 this is an old game so probably not
[5:31:09] <Vortexsilence> Seeing Max play Jean is satisfying
[5:31:09] <+davidbloodycage> I absolutely LOVE the ui. I played vf2 on saturn back in the day and this looks like exactly what I remember
[5:31:13] <Wiiplayah43> @brother_b_mo decent. not bad, but not rollback. the general consensus is that it's sufficient/acceptable
[5:31:27] <Daldondo> Man, I wanna see more El Blaze players
[5:31:28] <sedated_kidd> Max is bullying at this point lol
[5:31:28] <Jarabec_> Ah ok, thanks guys! Gonna give this a shot this week
[5:31:36] <+ttbeezy> the jump back tech
[5:31:39] <%flipsilog> hey @maximilian_dood you ready for next week's crazy game releases schedule? doodBait doodCrazy doodScrub
[5:31:41] <%Kitsune826> it worked though
[5:31:48] <heero719> crazy hit sound
[5:31:49] <%MrMidLife> DOA was built on the same tech, but their systems are much more unga-bunga.
[5:31:54] <%Kitsune826> ya
[5:32:00] <Profmcstevie> Build the knowledge base of doing ANYTHING and the optimal stuff comes natural
[5:32:03] <+KingZai> Damn, Max is improving so fast
[5:32:03] <%GabuFGC> I'm a 3rd Dan Jean now! PogChamp
[5:32:09] <taken351> KOFXV is coming in 2022
[5:32:13] <mikewwm98> Is VF4 Evo still worth playing?
[5:32:17] <RollbackReem> this game is so much fun
[5:32:18] <%XionBarzhad> @MrMidLife All that work into the sweat technology roflgatorSmug
[5:32:20] <%HiroesX81> this music takes me back
[5:32:23] <Wiiplayah43> dat bgm
[5:32:23] <FIGHTZONE_ITA> @sodush @OptimusCack there's a few hicups of course. No Audio in other mods EXCEPT for the stuff that was possible in the arcade if i got it right and obviously no online. And save data doesn't work so no customization or DLC in the mod. It's just to make it run
[5:32:26] <@Nightbot> Check out NZXT’s newest Starter PC series! An excellent first gaming PC--perfect for school work and working from home while maintaining great gaming performance. Built and shipped within 48 hours with a 2-year warranty. http://nzxt.co/SPC_MaxChat
[5:32:30] <%Kitsune826> doesn't seem like he comes up against any jeans
[5:32:31] <HimakiLuvsU> Keep at it Max
[5:32:32] <+bugpills> can u show what a combo looks like in this game
[5:32:36] <%Tetsuya5963> yeah KOF15's release date has been delayed to 2022. NotLikeThis
[5:32:37] <%quique_schz> it feels almost like a link to me
[5:32:38] <%AnimeCwboy> @mikewwm98 I adored VF4 Evo
[5:32:38] <+kohakune> Dead or Alive as much as I like it can be cleanly defined as "Horny Teen VF". Throw cancels and read conversions are turned into one button counters, unga combos, way more anime
[5:32:43] <EtherNigh> that sidestep noise tho
[5:32:49] <%DreamPhantasyTV> can you do it again?
[5:32:53] <%LocalAlienParty> @mikewwm98 yes, the massive single player and tutorial is worth it
[5:32:58] <%MrMidLife> @XionBarzhad are you questioning Tecmo's Core Values :p
[5:33:04] <fgc_splash> FRAME DATA Analyzing time! GlitchCat
[5:33:04] <Zcanzer> doa looks better visually
[5:33:08] <JDtG_Twitch> @kohakune that is the best description of doa i have ever heard
[5:33:10] <%DreamPhantasyTV> yeaaah!
[5:33:10] <%12catblack> hows the netcode
[5:33:12] <kefka_himself> @flipsilog   i honestly dnt know how he does it, look at him still awake XD
[5:33:15] <Kaio_Ken1989> damn
[5:33:17] <+GOTTAJOOCE> sick
[5:33:20] <TheChapyGuy> VF is more similar to DoA than Tekken is similar to Soul Calibur in terms of sister series
[5:33:21] <@Viewtifulotaku7> 12347
[5:33:21] <%The_Vengeful> @kohakune well said LUL
[5:33:24] <%titanium_kyle> @Tetsuya5963 yeah but first quarter so between Jan and Mar doodGood
[5:33:24] <+iamRayOfLight> @kohakune and the million whale half porn costumes
[5:33:25] <%XionBarzhad> @MrMidLife I'm a valued stock holder. Give me more Core Values.
[5:33:25] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> yeah DOA may look a bit crispier
[5:33:26] <sedated_kidd> the last time I played a Virtua Fighter game was on ps2
[5:33:28] <zenith0111> DOA really be a mash fedt
[5:33:30] <%RofflessLWK> !vf5
[5:33:30] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[5:33:31] <taken351> good thing strive and VF5 is here
[5:33:32] <sodush> @FIGHTZONE_ITA I see. I think I saw online mode being usable in steam version of Yakuza 6 if you just changed the code and people were hosting tourneys with parsec through Yakuza 6
[5:33:33] <%HiroesX81> netcode is decent
[5:33:48] <jojopistachio> this music slaps hard
[5:33:48] <Seri_Misaki> can you side walk and side step in this game or just sidestep?
[5:33:48] <+DynaCatArt> DOA has better physics FeelsAmazingMan
[5:33:54] <%Kitsune826> i loved doa4 for the grappler characters, tina was really fun to play
[5:33:55] <%titanium_kyle> @Tetsuya5963 tbh we didnt really know a lot other than some characters so far, considering its June now. I kinda expected it to be 2022 tbh
[5:33:58] <RollbackReem> @maximilian_dood in terms of gameplay and roster alone which do you think is better tekken 7 or vf5
[5:34:00] <andviceversa_> whoaaa
[5:34:01] <%jonboy204> @Maximilian_DOOD why does Jean look like Ken, Dante and Jin's fuck baby?
[5:34:08] <%DevilsLuckGaming> VF5 is like DoA but you can't unga bunga with every character
[5:34:09] <sh0gunfg> yooo max still griding? lol
[5:34:12] <EricBIG777> They should add fatalities to this
[5:34:14] <+Xenkei> Xenkei subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 9 month streak! lets goooooooooooooooooooooo
[5:34:20] <%yhmjack1> @DynaCatArt You mean boob physic? Kappa
[5:34:23] <%RadicalHighway> pie doodTerror
[5:34:23] <TheChapyGuy> go beat up this new guy
[5:34:23] <%XionBarzhad> Kind of hope they actually spend some effort on DoA 7. 6 jsut felt like an expansion DLC of 5 doodSad
[5:34:28] <%MrMidLife> VF4 is the only game in the series I didn't own because I didn't have a PS4
[5:34:28] <%IrionX> you cant mash on DoA, you will get hold counter to hell LUL
[5:34:30] <%SleepyNingyo> KomodoHype KomodoHype
[5:34:31] <frosty_frozon> oh god NotLikeThis
[5:34:35] <%UndeservingKonomichan> abbaLUL slap!
[5:34:37] <%GuruSmeghead> @EricBIG777 can you give a valid reason why?
[5:34:38] <OptimusCack> jean's punishes are: 12f = pk, 15f = p+k 33pk (iirc), and 17f = 6k (your juggle combo)
[5:34:42] <zenith0111> Is this Pai real? aeroSweat
[5:34:42] <kefka_himself> Win ratio?
[5:34:45] <%LocalAlienParty> they must be on a winning streak maybe
[5:34:49] <FIGHTZONE_ITA> @sodush parsec is pretty much the exception of course as you play via screen sharing effectively, kinda like Steam Screenshare feature. But ehi, it's better than nothing on PC, if u really wanna take that hitch for VF5 in general xD
[5:34:49] <Leodash_> hidden ELO rating?
[5:34:49] <%MrMidLife> I think ya boi ranking up fast.
[5:34:50] <%hoernchenspielt> makes sense if he sets to better opponnents
[5:34:52] <+DynaCatArt> @yhmjack1 FeelsGoodMan maybeee
[5:34:56] <Daldondo> This poor pai
[5:35:03] <%Kalzassa> @XionBarzhad considering they took out the tag it's more of a back step.
[5:35:14] <EricBIG777> @gurusmeghead Japanese history
[5:35:24] <TheChapyGuy> are her feet making jet engine noises?
[5:35:24] <%LocalAlienParty> @hoernchenspielt yeah that's prob it
[5:35:26] <+fourty6andtwo> Ive never played a vf before. whats important to keep in mind compared to playing other fighting games?
[5:35:28] <ailabsecs> why did he choose jean ?
[5:35:29] <%HiroesX81> oh this one is learned
[5:35:30] <Zcanzer> doa 6 is the best looking 3d fighter.
[5:35:31] <zhuravli> I just sad that DOA6  stopped getting support in the first year NotLikeThis
[5:35:35] <+CloudierCloud> i just joined and i don't know this game series but it looks ROUGH LUL
[5:35:39] <ddsr97> is this game easier to play then other popular fighting games?
[5:35:39] <%RadicalHighway> nice
[5:35:40] <%krystalcute91> enken that fighting style
[5:35:43] <bagoosh> chops applied to ankles
[5:35:44] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @fourty6andtwo 3 buttons and heavy execution.
[5:35:45] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> the parry punish
[5:35:52] <%XionBarzhad> @Kalzassa Yeah...It is a very gimped version. I think they got to DLC happy with 5 and just decided to do no effort.
[5:35:52] <+ttbeezy> doa reminds me of dbz budoki punch punch punch kick
[5:35:55] <Koiyuki> has he gone wild yet
[5:35:58] <iheartmota> Cause Jean is kinda sick thats why
[5:36:09] <%HiroesX81> gg
[5:36:11] <%cool_username12345> nice counter
[5:36:14] <%XionBarzhad> @zhuravli Doesn't it still get DLC costumes?
[5:36:16] <A_m_v_J> Jean 0f VF = Bryan of Tekken
[5:36:18] <%quique_schz> @ddsr97 nooo, is proabbly the hardest
[5:36:19] <kayosugoi> what did he say?
[5:36:26] <mikewwm98> @zhuravli when the DLC costs more than the game, and the game is already expensive af, then the game will be' dead after a while
[5:36:27] <%TokenBlackDood> @ddsr97 easy to jump in, extremely hard to master
[5:36:29] <%sae_what> RANK UPPU
[5:36:31] <FIGHTZONE_ITA> @zhuravli i mean ... considerin how Tecmo Koei kinda butchered DOA6 in becoming like a cashcow for costumes , i can't blame the general pubblic for hatin on the game
[5:36:32] <kefka_himself> @ddsr97  hard learning curve
[5:36:33] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[5:36:34] <+Rikka66> @ddsr97 hahahaha no
[5:36:35] <TheChapyGuy> his outfit is so edgy, but his poses and animations are so goofy
[5:36:36] <%Heretic_Monger> comfyOwO
[5:36:41] <taken351> KOFXV can wait we will enjoy VFUS and Strive until then :)
[5:36:42] <%RofflessLWK> Speaking of DOA, Max's Rate The Costumes for DOA6 had me in tears. Funniest reactions ever, especially for Honoka and Marie. doodLUL doodLUL
[5:36:42] <EtherNigh> Its for pao
[5:36:48] <%DevilsLuckGaming> Max picking Ken lost in a JoJo season over here
[5:36:50] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> can you counter the counter like in Tekken?
[5:36:54] <%Kalzassa> actually is for her
[5:36:55] <Kaio_Ken1989> wow nice
[5:36:55] <CoruscatingDream> that win segment sounds like bloody roar 4's win sound
[5:36:56] <66akira> @ddsr97 actually the hardest LUL
[5:36:58] <benewashere> Hi chat, is this the original or the dragon engine one?
[5:36:58] <%HiroesX81> vf takes time to learn but its fun
[5:37:00] <+thesilverhelix> Jean is a jojo character lets be honest
[5:37:01] <%MrMidLife> @CloudierCloud yeah, yeah :)
[5:37:01] <heero719> in water
[5:37:11] <%Vffvx90> Kof doodSad
[5:37:12] <+Has_TTV> is this gonna be on pc?
[5:37:14] <%sae_what> I love the classic Lifebars so nostalgic
[5:37:16] <HimakiLuvsU> Jean Kujo = Ash Crimson of Tekken
[5:37:18] <+solidpeyo> is so hard to do the combos of this game with the PS5 controller NotLikeThis
[5:37:22] <%XionBarzhad> @benewashere DE version.
[5:37:24] <%RofflessLWK> @benewashere Dragon Engine!
[5:37:35] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> @Has_TTV I think it is PS exclusive? Not sure though
[5:37:37] <FIGHTZONE_ITA> no offense of course, DOA6 is a good game ... just badly managed but there's plenty of games that suffered that fate ... MVC:I dang it -_- @zhuravli
[5:37:38] <%Kalzassa> @XionBarzhad Mmmhmm, I never did get 6 due to lack of the tag, but it just seemed like why bother if got the final version of 5.
[5:37:45] <%krystalcute91> @benewashere based of yakuza engine
[5:37:45] <+ttbeezy> p5 controller so weak
[5:37:46] <Cman70> damage NotLikeThis
[5:37:47] <%MrMidLife> i love this Music!!!!
[5:37:49] <%Kitsune826> @Has_TTV noone knows
[5:37:53] <txcforever> @solidpeyo Yeah, PS5 D-Pad sucks.
[5:37:56] <%krystalcute91> !vf5
[5:37:56] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[5:37:56] <kayosugoi> are you almost virtua fighter god rank max? :o
[5:38:00] <%onilao> started playing this last night...loving it so far!
[5:38:00] <%XionBarzhad> @Has_TTV Probably not. Sony basically funded this. Best hope for VF6 to be on PC.
[5:38:01] <zhuravli> Well, for me atleast i just buy what i wanna use so
[5:38:05] <%cool_username12345> nicee
[5:38:08] <+KOOKIEZrYUM> almost 7th dan time!
[5:38:12] <Damon_Dynamic1> Max did u hear KOF15 got delayed
[5:38:17] <HimakiLuvsU> This poor kyu
[5:38:17] <@cawi> @Maximilian_DOOD Are combos mostly the same? I only know one Jean combo, but it can be mashed out of.
[5:38:18] <Kaio_Ken1989> dang Max your getting nice
[5:38:24] <Daldondo> you will get a rank match next fight
[5:38:27] <%asgard147> RANKU-UP! limesCorn
[5:38:27] <DJ_is_Raiden> KOF Delayed max
[5:38:30] <%onilao> its super fun!
[5:38:35] <%Bealy_beal> doodGood doodGood
[5:38:35] <+solidpeyo> @txcforever yeah I keep missing my inputs
[5:38:36] <+Has_TTV> thanks for the answers all <3
[5:38:38] <brucewayne3134> Is movement liks tekken?? and how to stop  mashers? how does punishing work in this  feels so different to tekken
[5:38:43] <Yoomazir> so glad to see soem VF action in 2021
[5:38:44] <BreadMakerCTM> jesus 5h30 already!?
[5:38:54] <Skyknight1997> you gonna do warzone tonight?
[5:38:56] <@cawi> It starts with wheel kick yeah
[5:38:59] <%XionBarzhad> @Kalzassa Definitely. I'm a supporter of DoA. I enjoy the gameplay, despite the obvious "appeal". But it has definitely gone downhill. DoA 5 was pretty good so better to just stick with that. You don't gain anything going to 6.
[5:39:02] <Magsolid> Sony: Divided is our power!!
[5:39:02] <kayosugoi> are they plus when wake up kick hits?
[5:39:05] <%RofflessLWK> @Damon_Dynamic1 @DJ_is_Raiden He knows, he already briefly spoke about it! :D
[5:39:07] <taken351> i'm glad KOFXV is going to be put on hold until next year
[5:39:10] <%HiroesX81> theres the rollback Kappa
[5:39:32] <MustGoFetch> good combo
[5:39:32] <So_Sunni> Wouldn't you bag yourself with a chain belt? That looses chain looks dangerous
[5:39:35] <DoodTheKid> Lei Fei got an ugly mug in this one, they did him dirty
[5:39:37] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> so it's safer always going for the shorter ver
[5:39:38] <@cawi> The one I was thinking of was. Wheel kick, forward K+G, P, down P+k, back forward PK
[5:39:42] <Damon_Dynamic1> ok cool, I missed it
[5:39:43] <+danielqv01> is that Iori's voice??
[5:39:43] <%XionBarzhad> Know your options, adjust.
[5:40:02] <ZodiacFan72> Is VF5 a new game or old chat haven’t seen this game before
[5:40:04] <+thesilverhelix> I kind of like the old graphics better tbh
[5:40:05] <kayosugoi> is this more complex than tekken?
[5:40:06] <Daldondo> @maximilian_dood you should rank up with one more win
[5:40:07] <@NicoB7700> I've been having so much fun playing this game
[5:40:13] <%onilao> for this type of game you really need to learn how to adjust in combat
[5:40:19] <+ohKrypticc> @so_sunni dangerous but baaaad aaaassss, u waan fight someone who wears a chain belt?😳
[5:40:20] <%Kalzassa> @XionBarzhad I highly prefer it over the other 3d fighters for gameplay alone, the outfits are just a bonus for me happythoCute but most people just see the obvious and 6 didn't help it any yea. happythoNotLikeThis
[5:40:20] <sedated_kidd> can you change the music in this game? anyone know?
[5:40:21] <%XionBarzhad> @ZodiacFan72 9+ years old.
[5:40:24] <JDtG_Twitch> @zodiacfan72 its 15 years old
[5:40:29] <%TokenBlackDood> @zodiacfan72 it's about 15 years old
[5:40:30] <+KOOKIEZrYUM> @ZodiacFan72 reeeeal old
[5:40:31] <%RofflessLWK> @ZodiacFan72 Technically old, but this is a remaster/remake based on the Dragon Engine (Yakuza)
[5:40:36] <%matt301apx> Do u like this or GG more Max?
[5:40:37] <+kohakune> I didn't even touch DOA6 for more than two hours. I'm not even against the demographic shift, I play Arknights and Uma Musume. It's that it feels so committee made
[5:40:38] <+solidpeyo> @zodiacfan72 is a remaster/remake of a very old game

[5:41:56] <%XionBarzhad> @Kalzassa Definitely. The DLC for 5 is just absolutely ridiculous. I like supporting a game but I would've been out of the home trying to support that. Here's hoping 7 (if it ever happens) can help bring the game back to sweaty glory.
[5:42:00] <%TokenBlackDood> @devilsluckgaming yes, in the lower left. it's called "Execution" that's the start up frames
[5:42:02] <%MrMidLife> At the risk of sounding obvious, this is a series where it's more about paying attention to how your opponent uses their character, rather than what you know their char can do.

[5:42:35] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> 50% life gone
[5:43:00] <%XionBarzhad> Knowing what a character can do helps a lot. But yeah you got to read the player more cause identity is more prominent here than other fighters.
[5:43:05] <Damon_Dynamic1> question for chat will learning this game make u better at playing Tekken?
[5:43:07] <Kobukson> at a start of a round max
[5:43:08] <+kohakune> Nyotengu in DOA is nice tho. Sure it's a Araara Sexy version of old Tengu but they really tried with her design
[5:43:11] <%MrMidLife> They need to guard for it to work, don;t they?
[5:43:14] <13ig_Kain> why is Jean wearing a sports bra?
[5:43:22] <@Nightbot> Watch our YoVideogames stream archives on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/yovideogames
[5:43:30] <@cawi> @Damon_Dynamic1 these games play kind of different.
[5:43:32] <%DeadlyPenguin_> @maximilian_dood what's a magic 4?

[5:43:51] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> nice*
[5:43:52] <%XionBarzhad> @Damon_Dynamic1 ehhhhh maybe. Probably mostly in just being able to read/predict attacks.

[5:43:53] <%Adwark> @Damon_Dynamic1 While Virtua Fighter has inspired a lot of Tekken stuff, I'd still would say they're have fair amount of differences that set them quite apart
[5:43:56] <+rawwXO> u streaming E3 Max?
[5:43:57] <sedated_kidd> @13ig_kain I just realized that too 😂

[5:44:39] <+Jiziason> how do you do Lau's 2,46P I'm having trouble getting it to come out
[5:44:41] <%trashmyego> Today was an absolute blast playing this :D So glad to have VF back in the world.
[5:44:47] <bladbaby> are there any weird inputs in this game?
[5:44:49] <%Averagevi3w> Averagevi3w subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[5:45:00] <%Kalzassa> @XionBarzhad Thing about the DLC as well is yeah it's nuts, but ultimate or last round itself came with so many outfits for everyone, so to me if people wanted even more then whatever, but yeah people just see the negatives of it/assumed ones.
[5:45:02] <%NEXUSreligion> is magic 4 the name of Jeans stand?
[5:45:07] <mogul___> kazumi's magic 4 DansGame
[5:45:08] <%XionBarzhad> When you start doing a lot of spinning and dipping, you'll be thankful for the chest strap. Cloth is bad for rubbin
[5:45:08] <Dekuraii> Reaction
[5:45:10] <+kohakune> @13ig_Kain 2000s edgy gothic fashion flashback. They gave Dante the same thing with a topless holster.
[5:45:10] <Damon_Dynamic1> ok, I was just wondering with all the deep mechanics. it seems almost universal for 3d Fighters
[5:45:14] <%alphagt3> Block is under reaction @Maximilian_DOOD
[5:45:15] <cyanide76> doodmaxhype_SQ
[5:45:15] <%fancyfantasy> advanced settings?

[5:45:30] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> oh shit
[5:45:35] <fgc_splash> i need to know the ACTIVE FRAMES for Sabaki's! BibleThump NotLikeThis
[5:45:36] <ridwan7077> this game kinda looks like the fake games kids play in movies
[5:45:37] <Skyknight1997> You think theyll ever do another darkstalkers game @Maximilian_DOOD ???
[5:45:38] <%XionBarzhad> @Kalzassa Yeah thats the other thing. Why buy the DLC when an ultimate is further down the line.
[5:45:43] <OptimusCack> define weird. some characters have inputs like 246[button] or 26[button]
[5:45:46] <zhuravli> I think dude wearing shit with exposed abs is 80's thing?
[5:45:48] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> that look like the kazuya combo
[5:45:52] <%NEXUSreligion> that combo looks sick omg
[5:45:56] <lintzer7> That face punch seems to hurt WutFace
[5:46:04] <@cawi> Its all guaranteed

[5:46:25] <%onilao> so far they is many playing as different characters too
[5:46:27] <%Kalzassa> @XionBarzhad Mmmhmm, just some over reactions, let alone SF5 has done the same thing, soooo. happythoGiggle
[5:46:32] <%Sorrowful_Suicide> That's sick doodmaxhype !
[5:46:33] <Profmcstevie> Mids all day then guard break sugoiSmugsnake
[5:46:36] <%diggusx> is that a dial in combo?
[5:46:39] <%Kalzassa> @theironreaper doodDood doodSweet
[5:46:45] <@cawi> I want to play VF again, but dont want to pay for PS+. Playing Goh is fun
[5:46:46] <+Wet_DadKisses> digging Jean's training bra
[5:46:46] <+LowHighKang> Looks cool as fuck
[5:46:48] <zhuravli> *shirt
[5:46:51] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> that may be viable at the start of a match too
[5:46:52] <Auriculum> the last hit is a just frame NotLikeThis
[5:46:52] <%Adwark> @FrosTKoi On 8th obvious choice. On 9th I predict Max will not be able to log into PSO2NG and thus will end up playing Strive LUL
[5:47:00] <%onilao> looks sick
[5:47:01] <RaKazuto> this guy, in the chain was your main? @Maximilian_DOOD
[5:47:10] <justabot9696> holy shit thats fast
[5:47:13] <taken351> it's $30
[5:47:16] <mogul___> the beginning of that reminds me of kazuya's b3,2
[5:47:16] <+solidpeyo> @cawi PS + is on sale now I think
[5:47:17] <kobura57> Finally Max getting in serious things
[5:47:19] <zenith0111> Round ender
[5:47:28] <@cawi> @solidpeyo Is it possible to pay for just a month of it?
[5:47:29] <OptimusCack> it's a sequence. akira has one of these, too...and some other guard breaks
[5:47:39] <%NEXUSreligion> omg watching that looks so smooth
[5:47:40] <%FrosTKoi> Adwark what about streamer perk tho? LUL
[5:47:40] <+SuperKokuJin916> The game is 30usd on psn. Alessi free on PS Now.
[5:47:42] <@cawi> Last I played I mash the sequence and then just time the last part
[5:47:48] <Magsolid> remind me of lee chalange
[5:47:48] <TruzenHilpom> why do you like this badguy style character?
[5:47:48] <%XionBarzhad> @Kalzassa Indeed. I got SF5 when it first came out (when it had nothing to do and no story mode). Didn't touch the game again until the Super Turbo Hyper Arcade Flash Tournament Edition X version came out.
[5:47:51] <JUJUxANONY> Do they still do the 14 day PS+ trial?
[5:47:54] <Kobukson> max getting into the vf iceberg
[5:47:59] <fgc_splash> OMG AOI claraaHug TwitchUnity
[5:48:03] <%Adwark> @cawi Note though - you can play Playstation Plus games only when your subcription is active, and PS Plus is needed for online.
[5:48:17] <+Arngrinn> VF looking good, i remember the first one back on i think sega saturn
[5:48:18] <13ig_Kain> its weird the close relationship between Xbox and SEGA that this was a PS exclusive
[5:48:20] <+solidpeyo> @cawi 3 months is the lowest I have seen
[5:48:24] <%XionBarzhad> That straight up reminds me of Kazuya's combo back in Tekken Tag.
[5:48:36] <%kojack_ay> jin and kazuya do that as well right?
[5:48:37] <@cawi> @Adwark Yeah. I just want to touch it for a bit, but I own it on 360 already. Well the older version I should say
[5:48:43] <%trashmyego> @solidpeyo Yeah, I think it is too? I regularly keep an eye out for whenever it drops down to around $30 for a year. Have a few banked hah.
[5:48:43] <zenith0111> Itd be crazy if he can still otg after
[5:48:48] <%lowpolybreakfast> This really is some workout music right now
[5:48:52] <%savagedrag00n> PS Plus is currently doing a $44.99 sale/year thing atm because of State of Play I think
[5:48:53] <JUJUxANONY> looks dope tho
[5:49:08] <Kaio_Ken1989> ^
[5:49:08] <%Makriev> is it a just frame?
[5:49:08] <%onilao> sarah has a few like that too max
[5:49:09] <%Kalzassa> @XionBarzhad Mmmhmm same, literally, played bout 3 weeks, was like eh. Got Champion Edition with so much stuff sooo yea not like can't get these games with lot of the dlc/outfits for cheap, people just don't wanna wait.
[5:49:11] <%Adwark> @cawi And yeah, 1 month subscriptions are available for Ps Pluis
[5:49:15] <Chris1sefa> @Maximilian_DOOD try without looking
[5:49:17] <DeliLizard> so it's a just frame?
[5:49:18] <GohDroxen> Imagine doing this online Kappa
[5:49:21] <kobura57> Thats the skkll part of Jean he has twho things like that
[5:49:23] <%krystalcute91> !vf5
[5:49:23] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[5:49:32] <OptimusCack> lol i just renewed my ps+ like two days before they put it on sale
[5:49:35] <%theironreaper> I assume someone has told max/he already heard that pso ng is coming out the 8th?
[5:49:43] <maohayato> @13ig_Kain MS doesnt do much on fighting games
[5:49:44] <EricBIG777> King of Iron Deficiency Tournament
[5:49:54] <+GarouFGC> I really like Brad in VF5. It just kind of sucks that his quickest starts into Low Stance or Slippin' are either slow af, Or Highs.
[5:49:54] <%onilao> its great to throw off opponents who guard a lot
[5:49:54] <taken351> there was no way KOFXV would be out this year
[5:50:06] <%Adwark> @theironreaper wat. Wasn't it supposed to be 9th?!
[5:50:08] <%Brunty023> @theironreaper You can see how he reacted on his twitter
[5:50:11] <%iichalk> 9th for PSO
[5:50:11] <@cawi> @Maximilian_DOOD The buffer should be lenient enough you can do the first 5 inputs early?
[5:50:11] <%theironreaper> Excuse me 9th
[5:50:14] <txcforever> The timing for this is insane. Like to the frame or it won't register.
[5:50:18] <Chris1sefa> @Maximilian_DOOD try without looking
[5:50:23] <%TokenBlackDood> @theironreaper he knows very much so
[5:50:32] <cbprophet> yes pso2 NGS is out on the 9th.
[5:50:42] <%XionBarzhad> @Kalzassa Part of me is thankful DLC became a thing cause "yay updates". But at the same time I dislike how horribly monetized it became. Kind of wish new fighters were free but costumes were the only DLC.
[5:50:47] <%Woodsy482> Woodsy482 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! doodHey
[5:50:50] <%Adwark> @theironreaper Ah yeah, then he's 100% aware and well, he even touched that on stream on day it was announced LUL
[5:50:50] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> ohhhh that combo is evil man
[5:50:59] <JDtG_Twitch> @xionbarzhad same
[5:51:02] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> what a weird input timing
[5:51:11] <kobura57> Thats the skill part of Jean
[5:51:12] <Profmcstevie> Your opening up moves are cool at least
[5:51:16] <zenith0111> What kind of character is Jean?
[5:51:19] <%theironreaper> @Adwark Good to know lol
[5:51:19] <%bigmicahc> @Maximilian_DOOD Kind of makes the Pretzel Motion seem reasonable
[5:51:29] <0bani> I hate back forward inputs
[5:51:36] <%XionBarzhad> @zenith0111 The punchy kicky kind Kappa
[5:51:44] <%SquallAdv> VF is so much fun to play ^^
[5:51:50] <OptimusCack> 19f mid hit throw. don't see it a whole lot
[5:51:55] <%FatherAxeKeeper> the horse from ren and stimpy LUL
[5:51:57] <%titanium_kyle> ~Dont like it. Im p*ssed Dont like it im p*ssed~
[5:52:12] <%Kalzassa> @XionBarzhad Mmmhmm same, cause base SFV, I think it's literally impossible after a point to get all the characters with fight money only. Be nice if they had some outfits that buy with that and character were free.
[5:52:14] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> Jean reminds me of Dragunov maybe?
[5:52:15] <%Adwark> @theironreaper It's bonkers, Strive-PSO2NG-FF7R Integrade literally day after day and 2 days after FF7 comes E3 LUL

[5:52:29] <%XionBarzhad> The one thing I do not like about 3D fighters....those input strings notkohNotLikeThis Ryu Hayabusa izuna drop comes to mind.
[5:52:37] <+kohakune> @XionBarzhad Sadly fighting games arent perpetually profitable like say GTA online of League. Even then, those have like 10-15 dollar skins and have their budget sales in the corner of the shop
[5:52:44] <%Adwark> @Kalzassa Don't you get Fight Money for every online match?
[5:52:45] <Musky_EXE> love this stream
[5:52:54] <%martymakesart> @nagrandt_the_vagrant nah haha google GOH in virtua fighter
[5:52:55] <%TokenBlackDood> @nagrandt_the_vagrant Dragnov is definitely Goh
[5:52:57] <%iichalk> @xionbarzhad Whaaa?! Izuna drop is so easy tho
[5:53:03] <%theironreaper> @Adwark At least it’s too much stuff though.  A good problem to have compared to too little.
[5:53:03] <+solidpeyo> yeah I'm so surprised with how many combos and move Vanessa have
[5:53:10] <EricBIG777> Sometimes you don’t want to fight anymore
[5:53:13] <%titanium_kyle> @Adwark i think e3/games announcements in general this month are gonna be good this year. Just a weird feeling i have, y'know?
[5:53:18] <JDtG_Twitch> @kalzassa yeah but what if you don’t wanna play online?
[5:53:20] <%iichalk> Now the raijin is a nightmare @xionbarzhad
[5:53:26] <%XionBarzhad> @kohakune Yeah, probably be better to do like expansions or something.
[5:53:30] <DJ_is_Raiden> i think max should check out the guides in ***

[5:53:36] <%XionBarzhad> I'm probably thinking of the Raijin
[5:53:37] <OptimusCack> the restand/bounce juggle combo only works on counter-hit iirc, max
[5:53:37] <neivil> yeah everyone needs to have taka specific combos because of his weight
[5:53:46] <%Brunty023> @solidpeyo You're essentially learning two characters with Vanessa
[5:53:46] <tatsu00> When is E3?
[5:53:48] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> @martymakesart @TokenBlackDood Oh Goh allright. What would say Jean looks compared to a Tekken char then?
[5:53:49] <%MrMidLife> Wishlist for this game: Rollback retrofit because people keep playing and keep asking.  And then open it up to players on other consoles.
[5:53:51] <+MisterMukkey> just got back. so combos can vary from opponent to opponent, chat?
[5:53:54] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> you*
[5:53:57] <%Adwark> @theironreaper Max advantage over many other variety streamers is that he built up viewership that will not mind watching also old fighting games, so Max always has stuff to fall back even when there is drought LUL
[5:54:02] <%Brunty023> @tatsu00 June 12th to 15th
[5:54:05] <%Kalzassa> @Adwark You do, but after a point/after you have no more trials you would have to play the game for weeks nonstop just to get one character.
[5:54:14] <@cawi> @MisterMukkey There is weight classes in this so some combos work while others dont.
[5:54:22] <@Nightbot> Check out our latest merch! Shirts, posters, mugs and more - https://maxdood.tv/merch
[5:54:25] <+Nocturne_Noble> The entire roster all have unique weights that gradate from Eileen to Taka.
[5:54:28] <kayosugoi> how plus on hit?
[5:54:36] <%Adwark> @titanium_kyle I expect nothing honestly because it's too much thinking for me "What could they show" LUL
[5:54:39] <%XionBarzhad> I know there was one combo I was doing with either Ryu or Hayate in training mode that legit took me 30+ mins to pull off. The inputs on it was so damn infuriating.
[5:54:43] <+solidpeyo> @brunty023 yeah the defensive and the offensive NotLikeThis, is fun tho
[5:54:45] <%TokenBlackDood> @nagrandt_the_vagrant movewise? the new girl Lidia or Devil Jin
[5:54:51] <tatsu00> @Brunty023 thx
[5:55:08] <%GabuFGC> YEa the second hit of PK has to counter hit
[5:55:14] <%titanium_kyle> @Adwark LUL fair enough doodGood
[5:55:22] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> @TokenBlackDood Devil Jin?? really? wow, cool
[5:55:22] <KSosei> hey max, i think 6k , 9k+g, into 4pk then 33pk is more damage
[5:55:26] <%iichalk> @xionbarzhad Raijin was Hcf+Thorw > B, F, U, D+throw > Uf, Db, Ub, Df + throw
[5:55:27] <%Adwark> @Kalzassa I see... explains why I heard about bots playing just to farm fight money
[5:55:30] <%Kalzassa> @JDtG_Twitch ? didn't say to not have the outfits not purchasable outright, just alt method, but either way you get so little that most people will say screw it after awhile.
[5:55:39] <lastofusspoil> i'm winning matches button mashing HyperCrown
[5:56:08] <%GabuFGC> If you CH with PK and hit the  P the K wont launch but if you wiff or they block the P and get hit by K they will be launched.
[5:56:16] <%titanium_kyle> holy crap
[5:56:17] <+Nocturne_Noble> Typically, what works on a heavier opponent will work on a lighter one with a little finesse. But it won't be optimal.
[5:56:17] <JDtG_Twitch> @kalzassa yeah that’s whati was saying, eventually you HAVE to play online if you want to get everything
[5:56:20] <%XionBarzhad> @iichalk Looking through my chat history on FB to figure out which one it was.
[5:56:26] <%Kalzassa> @Adwark Like I think 1 new character is like 100K fight money and you get like 50 to 100 per fight, soooooo yeah....6 characters per season/600k...yeah just buy champion edition instead happythoCrumpet
[5:56:30] <Storm_Samurai> Anyone else in chat have trouble with diagonal down towards x2 + guard evasion tutorial?
[5:56:34] <%Adwark> @titanium_kyle But we will see. Also we will see if SGF will live up to being worth caring as brand LUL
[5:56:57] <%Adwark> @Kalzassa monkaS
[5:57:05] <%titanium_kyle> @Adwark true LUL i think Capcom, Sega, and some other big names are at that event too? iirc?
[5:57:12] <%TokenBlackDood> @storm_samurai Max did that one earlier on stream. you should check the VoD
[5:57:38] <Storm_Samurai> @TokenBlackDood thanks!
[5:57:47] <taken351> the next KOFXV character will be revealed next week
[5:57:50] <%titanium_kyle> @Storm_Samurai i havent been able to beat that tutorial either
[5:58:00] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Storm_Samurai I gave up and cried.
[5:58:02] <%Kalzassa> @JDtG_Twitch yea and since it's thousands of hours, yeah much rather characters be free and outfits cost fight money, be there forever either way if wanted everything.
[5:58:02] <OptimusCack> some of these wall combos are very spacing specific
[5:58:10] <%GabuFGC> That splat on the K+G attack seems so Random.. I hate it
[5:58:30] <JDtG_Twitch> @kalzassa agree with you 100%
[5:58:32] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> very specific timings I see
[5:58:39] <Storm_Samurai> @Viewtifulotaku7 lol glad it wasn't only me
[5:59:05] <notgunnastream_> dick chop? 😳😳😳
[5:59:06] <+neonxaos> This is the part of VF I always hated, so floaty.
[5:59:10] <Hericknhx> maybe the need to be a flat hit on the wall not corner
[5:59:20] <+aroo27> stop hurting the FFXV cosplayer NotLikeThis
[5:59:28] <DeliLizard> the wall combos in this game look sick
[5:59:28] <%MarKellZC> I’m still enjoying this game! rubrLove markel6Laughingsarah doodmaxhype
[5:59:50] <grey_seer_thanquol> Looks good, not sure I like it looking so clean so use to VF's derpy graphics XD
[5:59:54] <coejuanzito> man, movement's so smooth in this game. Beautiful to see
[6:00:02] <sunk1n> Hi ! is thi online exprience still good ?
[6:00:04] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> @neonxaos yeah, 3D fighters all seem to have this long air juggles combo thing
[6:00:13] <@Viewtifulotaku7> !vf5
[6:00:13] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[6:00:18] <OptimusCack> the really disgusting wall combos are the ones where they do like a standing hit against the wall at a weird angle
[6:00:25] <journeymanapprentice> this is less floaty than tekken and doa

[6:01:01] <DeliLizard> tekken wall combos are braindead though
[6:01:06] <%Dark494> Dark494 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:01:12] <@cawi> I hope people are enjoying this who are new to it.
[6:01:24] <Hericknhx> if they were to make VF6 what new gameplay aspects would you like to see dood @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:01:31] <%Kalzassa> @Dark494 doodDood doodSweet
[6:01:38] <taken351> delaying KOFXV until next year was a good thing :)
[6:01:40] <FylgdarUlfr> Most basic tekken wall combos are really easy yeah, but side step re splat ones not so much imo
[6:01:40] <%titanium_kyle> vf1 Jean time LUL

[6:01:55] <JDtG_Twitch> Blocky time
[6:01:56] <Auriculum> LUL
[6:01:56] <%sae_what> THATS THAT GOOD SHIT
[6:01:58] <+neonxaos> @nagrandt_the_vagrant It's not so much the juggles, it's that characters in VF float so oddly, and you can hit them at the most improbable angles. It's hard to read visually.
[6:02:00] <orihalchon> Whoa the online spectate is running default on the main menu? That's sick PogChamp
[6:02:00] <Insignificant_Cat> lol

[6:02:08] <DaKnightWarrior> YEYEYE
[6:02:10] <OptimusCack> vf wall combos are harder because there are more types of wall interactions than something like tekken
[6:02:10] <Jacks_Loko> Its GOH time!
[6:02:14] <%Kalzassa> I would always be down for a tag mode, but I want that in everything so happythoLUL

[6:05:35] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> that rolling forward kick is so good
[6:05:36] <wellbornwarrior> @Brunty023 Looks kinda out of place in a somewhat grounded game like this.
[6:05:36] <jinchuriki703> this game is so hard
[6:05:39] <bryllun> Blocky Jean.
[6:05:43] <%TokenBlackDood> @overpoweredyeti no. Goh is stubby af. his throw game is dope tho
[6:05:51] <tacticalnuke002> Why even play Goh if you're not using Judo throws
[6:05:55] <tamerlanethegreat> That's what he gets for trying to make a boxer out of a Judoka.

[6:07:54] <prettystardoll> Not sure if I like that
[6:08:08] <Zerixar> do people do the gems on left hand and right foot for a visual queue of some sort? or is it just cosmetics

[6:12:45] <%GabuFGC> I asked this earlier but are you going to just solo main Jean until strive comes out or are you going to explore other characters eventually?
[6:12:47] <striderhayabusa> thats a really cool feature
[6:12:48] <+oyanpi> @kazuyayakuza yes
[6:12:48] <%Adwark> @KazuyaYakuza Yep.

[6:12:56] <+slobbermanspence> hey @maximilian_dood where do you put Virtua Fighter on the tier list of fighting games.
[6:12:57] <%Bholorak> Aoi and Pai have low parries
[6:12:57] <+ohKrypticc> Goh has a low deflect
[6:12:59] <%yeknomlive> are low parries not universal?
[6:13:00] <@cawi> Goh has a low punch and mid parry. It depends on the character
[6:13:01] <DrCandyPants> BENIMARU VS RYU atpRtsuspectd atpRtsuspectd
[6:13:02] <bryllun> That's cool of a feature. More fgs should have this.
[6:13:04] <Hericknhx> Brad kinda has a low parry to I think
[6:13:08] <+LastGambit> Jacky neutral parry seems really good
[6:13:08] <%Adwark> @CaptainAlpha99 PS4 (PS5 through compatibility)
[6:13:10] <Samuraith> @mightysandwich ahhhhh been a while since I played this
[6:13:12] <PatchySouls> goddamn the wall broke

[6:13:23] <%MrMidLife> @Supersonic540 thanks, I knew I was forgetting somebody.
[6:13:28] <DNICE3838> !VF5
[6:13:28] <@Nightbot> Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown is a PS4 exclusive that is backwards compatible on PS5. It is currently free on PS+. The Netcode probably the best Delay Based, but still not Rollback levels.
[6:13:33] <+YanniSirus> Is Jean's low parry 2P+K+G?
[6:13:35] <shockravenbeak> No VF means no Tekken
[6:13:37] <+aroo27> tbf SF2 is the series LUL
[6:13:40] <+Owltosser> @yeknomlive no, instead some characters have unique parries/reversals
[6:13:41] <brucewayne3134> @maximilian_dood is movement similar to tekken? and how do u punish  mashers in this everything feel safe on block.
[6:13:43] <Leodash_> WWE Asuka PogChamp

[6:14:04] <bryllun> VF was breakfast food @silkymimic
[6:14:10] <Baru_> true
[6:14:11] <+neonxaos> Tekken 1 was pretty much VF with textures
[6:14:12] <+OnikenUK> like shower heads?
[6:14:13] <kayosugoi> virtua fighter is the og of 3d fighting games yeah?
[6:14:17] <Insignificant_Cat> @uzamakinezi Er, no
[6:14:18] <%applemon198> tekken 7 customisation is just STOLEN from VF5
[6:14:19] <%Brunty023> @EtherNigh He mentioned it in his food video. Breakfast food
[6:14:20] <JDtG_Twitch> VF is breakfast
[6:14:21] <SilkyMimic> Breakfast, thanks SeemsGood
[6:14:26] <pixel_river> i like how retro  all VF games  looks and feels
[6:14:26] <OptimusCack> vf is still pretty big in japan
[6:14:27] <%Adwark> @aroo27 How many releases it had... like 4-5 during its era and then like 2-3 in era after SF2 LUL

[6:14:35] <@Viewtifulotaku7> !vflegacy
[6:14:36] <@Nightbot> The Virtua Fighter series is a long standing 3D fighting game that started back in 1993 and is widely known as the 1st of it's kind and has set the grounds for numerous other 3D fighting games that follow after.
[6:14:36] <thejuke87> KomodoHype
[6:14:37] <FaIIenDark> @Maximilian_DOOD Pretty much every 3D fighting game was just a VF clone
[6:14:38] <+ShadowScorpion> Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn!
[6:14:38] <%Terranoob1> I remember being so excited the first time i saw it in the arcades all those years ago.

[6:15:03] <%FatherAxeKeeper> i didnt realize that but thats neat
[6:15:04] <%Adwark> @applemon198 Tekken 5 already took customization, and Tekken 6 enhanced it. And Tekken 7 made it worse doodSad
[6:15:04] <Storm_Samurai> @Maximilian_DOOD what do you think caused the shift in popularity from VF to Tekken over time? Just less releases?
[6:15:05] <+HomemadeCoffee> Where you rank Bloody Roar Max?
[6:15:06] <DragoonKnight5515> I remember play VF in the arcade. So awesome!!
[6:15:07] <%SquirrelZOD> @Maximilian_DOOD You ever have concern that one fighting game might mess up how you play another? Like, will this mess you up at all when Strive comes out in a week?
[6:15:08] <orihalchon> @Maximilian_DOOD What do you think SEGA should do with VF6, aside from having rollback?

[6:17:58] <JDtG_Twitch> BITCHIMWILD
[6:18:00] <unso> i want fireballs :L
[6:18:02] <0bani> Any hopes for VF6?
[6:18:03] <ButtHashEnthusiast> So is this a old game with new graphics or a new game with old sound fx and ui?
[6:18:07] <thejuke87> He's Wild
[6:18:08] <mamoth137> damn this jeffry IS WIIILD
[6:18:09] <+ap_thehagg> apthehTwerks apthehTwerks apthehTwerks I’m drunk and had a great time fighting you.
[6:18:16] <%Qblackman34> sounds like wrong business decisions on 5
[6:18:16] <+sadgroceries33> Leave it to sega to completely goof up their game releases on the bright side I love this game :)
[6:18:16] <%buff_riku_says> THE WHOOSH IS FOR HOMING I'M JUST REALIZING
[6:18:16] <+Mantiskilla78> missed opportunity with not putting this on PC.  Maybe down the line?
[6:18:18] <imdengetsu> wilding
[6:18:18] <%applemon198> i can only imagine this re-release's primary objective is to gauge interest and get numbers data on the possibility of future instalments
[6:18:19] <%MrMidLife> @lagwaisse2 then why are you watching?
[6:18:19] <Baru_> lol
[6:18:25] <PatchySouls> OOOF that tackle
[6:18:28] <%DeadlyPenguin_> @maximilian_dood do you think that the games being attached to Yakuza revived interest in the franchise?
[6:18:29] <%guimachado666> guimachado666 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Yo Max , love from brazil you're the most entertaining streamer ever
[6:18:38] <%buff_riku_says> pardon my caps
[6:18:39] <%Adwark> @ButtHashEnthusiast Old game with new graphics. Also that old UI is DLC option Max chose.
[6:18:40] <Zanethepure> Very Function first design in VF
[6:18:47] <%xenocraigmorph> I just want Fighters Megamix BibleThump
[6:18:49] <+slobbermanspence> @maximilian_dood if you were to out Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter against eachother which do you think is the more accomplished
[6:18:50] <%DreamPhantasyTV> you think they might revive some more am2 games, like outrun??
[6:18:51] <+aroo27> homing = "unavoidable"s?
[6:18:54] <%nagrandt_the_vagrant> DAMN that combo looked brutal

[6:19:04] <Dekuraii> WOAH
[6:19:06] <%TheOGB> @ButtHashEnthusiast it's an old game remade in the Yakuza engine. the UI is a DLC customization
[6:19:06] <SolaVisions> ??
[6:19:06] <%Adwark> @ButtHashEnthusiast Music of older VFs is also part of this DLC and that would be it.
[6:19:06] <+Owltosser> @ButtHashEnthusiast the retro ui is part of a dlc, the game is a remaster of a game that came out around 2012. The sfx just stayed the same throughout the series
[6:19:07] <%TokenBlackDood> THAT DID DAMAGE

[6:23:44] <%linne_inverse> instead of VF6, Fighters Megamix 2
[6:23:46] <+GrooVyB_7> we need AKIRA in FORTNITE
[6:23:47] <%Kalzassa> @SirhcMachineStrongMan parries are more typically just like you block the attack/deflect and do what you want opposed to DOA being like a unique grab/throw. Some on here, like Wolf have more DOA like ones though.

[6:23:57] <Kaio_Ken1989> Nina?
[6:23:57] <%DreamPhantasyTV> It seems like they're ramping up their marketing
[6:23:57] <%Sulfur_Boride> Simmons said that AM2 hardly is even much of a thing anymore, so who'd develop VF6?
[6:23:57] <Tenebrae94> so put in a guest character?
[6:23:58] <pixel_river> Akira is that smash trohy Kappa
[6:23:58] <%titanium_kyle> @PatchySouls iirc Eileen is low tier

[6:25:50] <+HomemadeCoffee> Goro Majima in VF6 yessss
[6:25:51] <%coingray> Thing is, the martial arts style makes it stand out from other fighting games.
[6:25:52] <captinobvious10> yakuza????
[6:25:54] <%Kitsune826> do you think that'd make the old school people unhapppy? @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:25:55] <%titanium_kyle> Majima, Axel Stone, Joe Musashi, Vectorman even lol
[6:25:55] <%McNere> Kiryuu-chan~

[6:26:05] <Red_Proletariat> Terry Bogard in VF 6 let's go
[6:26:06] <NDUDE> Yagami would be rad.
[6:26:06] <r_altali> Bahn from Fighting Vipers
[6:26:06] <%xenocraigmorph> Kiryu should be in Virtua Fighter
[6:26:07] <0bani> Sega already has a Yakuza following
[6:26:07] <%sae_what> VYSE FROM SKIES OF ARCADIA lytWORRY
[6:26:08] <BlueBloodBlues> Ryo Hazuki
[6:26:11] <Yoomazir> Akira was in that Sega MK clone game, and isn't Sarah in DOA?
[6:26:13] <pr1me_778> Yakuza characters
[6:26:15] <%vash2pid0_o> PSO outfits LUL
[6:26:18] <Vulcan422> You can make Akira look like Ryo in Final Showdown, probably later DLC for Ultimate Showdown
[6:26:20] <odiz395> segata sanshro
[6:26:24] <+badjab326> Axel, Majima, Joe Musashi, Ryo
[6:26:26] <DJ_is_Raiden> add capoeira character
[6:26:27] <%Aidonis> Just introduce more styles as well tbh
[6:26:28] <%sae_what> so you're askin for a SEGA ALL STARS?
[6:26:28] <%applemon198> JUST THROW IN AKUMA
[6:26:29] <%YinYangRaiden> I'd like to see Ryo and Majima
[6:26:30] <JDtG_Twitch> I’d say Ryo is their best bet if they want to maintain realism
[6:26:34] <jaycreatives> Akira the last DLC for the SF5 ?
[6:26:35] <Funkyguy321> put daytona
[6:26:37] <+gophinobi23> I respect that take...but I don't agree with going the crossover route. There are other ways to make it more appealing though for sure
[6:26:38] <%Kalzassa> Axel and Blaze from Streets of Rage would be natural fits.
[6:26:40] <taufikjay> Axel from Crazy Taxi SeemsGood
[6:26:44] <+Owltosser> maybe a story mode?
[6:26:45] <x_art_of_life_x> Majima is def the best choice IMO
[6:26:46] <Leodash_> Momiji skin for Sarah Kreygasm
[6:26:46] <%titanium_kyle> Hornet LUL
[6:26:46] <+MrNightmare0477> vf vs tekken?
[6:26:48] <%Tetsuya5963> Sound effects ?
[6:26:49] <static_reaper115> Imagine they add a PSO costume to someone as a celebration of New Genesis
[6:26:49] <SFWOWR> VF tag mechanics?
[6:26:50] <+98iori> basically make a sega kof
[6:26:50] <%gamingchip0> OOOOOOO they can make a new character that does Capoeira doodOK doodOK doodOK doodOK doodOK

[6:26:55] <dr_curien> Put Seaman In it
[6:26:55] <%CyberneticHype> @Maximilian_DOOD Just joined, how's your online experience been so far?
[6:26:56] <%HuntingHornPete> OR go in the direction of virtual reality. It would be called VRF1
[6:26:57] <OliverMagnus> Bring back Sonic the Fighters
[6:26:57] <RorBoy> make Segata Sanshiro playable NOW
[6:26:58] <Kyllaruna> JANET FROM VIRTUA COP IN HD COME ON SEGA
[6:26:58] <Wiiplayah43> vipers would be DOPE
[6:26:59] <%thewb32018> That would be awesome
[6:26:59] <+Hitpawz> put in Alexx Kidd!!
[6:27:00] <natsufuji_> FIGHTING VIPERS Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:27:01] <%Kitsune826> there's so many martial arts they COULD pull from though to make new characters
[6:27:01] <SirCold_> Project diva is made by Sega. Vocaloid characters would be funny
[6:27:02] <NeetKiller> I mean so many other fighters do crazy flashy shit already
[6:27:02] <Moik___> wouldn't sell imo sadly moon2W
[6:27:03] <+Dangerlocker> Bring in NASCAR CAR
[6:27:03] <%lowpolybreakfast> True roster almost never changes
[6:27:08] <codyppp1> VF vs TEKKEN
[6:27:08] <fgc_splash> dont know what to feel about a new SYSTEM MECHANIC claraaSip
[6:27:09] <%LocalAlienParty> yeah streets of rage characters would work alongside yakuza
[6:27:11] <%sae_what> they can keep the gameplay the same, just add cooler characters yeah
[6:27:11] <%MtnDouken> @Maximilian_DOOD Random question, but has there been any news on what is being done to Strive since the 2nd beta?
[6:27:14] <KhaosK_UL> make more roster are better
[6:27:15] <blinkblank_> i would play this on pc
[6:27:15] <%DeadlyPenguin_> put in the Hornet
[6:27:16] <+天使42199> @maximilian_dood at that point would they need to change the title ? or would VF6 be fine
[6:27:17] <+Gamoranto> Honestly, this roster makes me feel nothing
[6:27:17] <DaKnightWarrior> Fighting Vipers <3
[6:27:18] <GreenShinobi26> Fighters Megamix remake or sequel would be Kreygasm
[6:27:18] <bulletpunch_8> Id buy it for a mf jet set radio rep lmao
[6:27:18] <OniBerserker> just add boxing and taekwondo characters
[6:27:19] <%sode_no_shirayuki_> Put bayonetta in it doodSweet
[6:27:20] <bryllun> You're asking for Sega to go the KOF route.
[6:27:20] <%DrLegendI> ULALA FOR VF6
[6:27:22] <+koey__> Just bring the cool characters, not anything cheeseball like the Daytona car
[6:27:24] <+badjab326> VF vs DOA full crossover game
[6:27:24] <%GabuFGC> PSO character in VF6
[6:27:25] <%MrMidLife> It's Virtua.  The foundation stone was always about trying to use only real martial arts which limits it.
[6:27:26] <DJ_is_Raiden> no, i hate that idea
[6:27:27] <TheAruarian> Tbh the jumping negates any sort of realism LUL
[6:27:28] <%coingray> Isn't a lot of SEGA's characters kind of legacy, though? Wouldn't they have the same problem the VF cast does?
[6:27:29] <PKcritical> Virtua Fighter & Knuckles
[6:27:30] <%brosencephalon> sonic vs Daytona car
[6:27:32] <%mrhappytrigers88> besides slow motion, do you want supers in VF? @maximilian_dood
[6:27:35] <tamerlanethegreat> @Maximilian_DOOD There's a difference between diversifying a game and washing out its identity. If it becomes Sega Allstars, it's not really Virtua Fighter.
[6:27:36] <samoori117> Yakuza protagonists?
[6:27:40] <%lionheartmoore_95> rollback netcode can only do so much
[6:27:41] <%AnderMakk> supers?
[6:27:41] <taufikjay> Yeah, something fresh is needed
[6:27:43] <%thewb32018> Fighters Megamix would be so dope
[6:27:43] <+Arngrinn> throw in some collabs and such hell its cliche give us bruce lee or some interesting collab characters
[6:27:44] <%MightySandwich> @DrLegendI Sarah had an Ulala item set in Final Showdown, gun and all
[6:27:45] <x_art_of_life_x> ALTERED BEAST FOR VF6 moon2A
[6:27:45] <NDUDE> @Maximilian_DOOD Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a SEGA celebration that a lot of people like over Mario Kart, so something like that but within the scope of VF?
[6:27:48] <shockravenbeak> Would Tekken guest character help??
[6:27:50] <+donuts142> @Maximilian_DOOD broken limbs/ realistic damage? thoughts?
[6:27:52] <%canis_divinus> I don't think VF necessarily sticks out with "memorable characters" in comparison to other fighting games with much bigger brands recognition
[6:27:52] <%AnderMakk> ADD SUPERS
[6:27:53] <Devaseus> Get Jackie Chan as a guest character who mocaps his own moves
[6:27:54] <%MrMidLife> @PKcritical I'm setting up the Kickstarter right now lol :)
[6:27:55] <%sae_what> VF6 featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series lytJACKPOT
[6:27:55] <+SuperKokuJin916> uh-oh! Father - Daughter dance!
[6:27:57] <+Sazre> Add Shenmue, Yakuza and Streets of Rage characters
[6:27:58] <%Ricky_Maru> support the game now to get more in the future
[6:28:00] <Adanion> the animations are very good thats for sure
[6:28:00] <+KeepoKompany> Lau Chan is sick 😡
[6:28:02] <+Nocturne_Noble> It needs a story mode written by the Yakuza team.
[6:28:03] <%linne_inverse> yo if there's a future where the Daytona Car can be on the main stage at EVO, I'm all for it
[6:28:04] <%TheOGB> damn that comeback
[6:28:07] <DNICE3838> lau is mine fav
[6:28:08] <Wiiplayah43> @koeyzzz nah, the car is awesome
[6:28:10] <%Kitsune826> it doesn't need to be like tao feng
[6:28:11] <JDtG_Twitch> Bring back Fighters Megamix and use it as a tie-in
[6:28:11] <dovahkin2697> any mechanics you want to have in vf?
[6:28:12] <%RushdownXIX> The jump in skill is insane honestly
[6:28:15] <artman747> alex kidd in vf6
[6:28:15] <%SquirrelZOD> Damage to clothing!
[6:28:17] <+mrcassidyart> What does DOA need to do? @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:28:17] <+ShadowScorpion> that KO was beautiful
[6:28:18] <Funkyguy321> what do you think about crossover character? who would you add?
[6:28:18] <%AnderMakk> ex moves or super
[6:28:22] <@Nightbot> Check out our latest merch! Shirts, posters, mugs and more - https://maxdood.tv/merch
[6:28:22] <Stoggaz> Honestly, the whole crossover of traditional fighting styles is such a cool fighting game concept. Just make the characters more exciting to look.
[6:28:24] <kevamadi> VF seems to take it's character-balancing VERY seriously, seeing as they've never added more than 2 characters in any iteration...
[6:28:25] <A_m_v_J> How does this play with a HitBox controller?
[6:28:26] <%Adwark> @donuts142 Mortal Kombat already took the space of violence in fighting games, where others... meh.
[6:28:27] <goldbuttcheeks> Gameplay looks fun and that means a lot
[6:28:28] <TheAruarian> There was a fighting game with realistic limb damage, it wasn't fun.

[6:28:52] <dmmm___> this game its too same the game Soul Excalibur in play station 2
[6:28:53] <%ChaosedStar> as a legacy thing getting jin and ayane as guests would be great
[6:28:53] <EtherNigh> DoA just need more physics Kappa
[6:28:54] <+gophinobi23> They don't need to add rage arts or any of that shit lol
[6:28:54] <NeetKiller> stop selling millions of DLC
[6:28:54] <%Kalzassa> DOA is fine, just bring back the tag and do more of what it does well.
[6:28:55] <gremoryy> DOA needs to stop making DLC LUL
[6:28:55] <Moik___> bushido blade?
[6:28:56] <$Unkn0wN71> yeah the characters in tekken which I would consider main competitor are so much more memorable
[6:28:58] <%Adwark> @Maximilian_DOOD DoA needs to change name to disconnect people idea of "this is booba game" LUL
[6:28:58] <%sae_what> They just need to embrace the Nood and the Lood and make their own hentai
[6:28:59] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[6:29:01] <Realkoolxmx> More TITS Kappa
[6:29:01] <%sode_no_shirayuki_> Better tits animation doodSweet
[6:29:02] <OliverMagnus> DoA needs to convert their current skin model to a Fortnite style battlepass game.
[6:29:03] <%applemon198> doa can and will continue to sell wedding dress packs at $100 a set. PEOPLE WILL BUY IT
[6:29:05] <%NaSh_kRaP> DOA atpCap
[6:29:05] <Kyllaruna> DOA needs more core values Kappa Kappa
[6:29:05] <misternegative2010> @Maximilian_DOOD How do you feel Soul Calibur is doing?
[6:29:06] <%MrMidLife> Lau Chan, Pai Chan...Kiryu-Chan? BOP
[6:29:06] <foxmonk> DOA needs to distance themselves a bit from their reputation of titty fighter
[6:29:06] <+Otsgekee> @Maximilian_DOOD Kung fu movie characters?
[6:29:07] <AntonioAS7X> DOA beach games > DOA fighting game atpGasm
[6:29:07] <+KeepoKompany> We know what DOA needs danNice
[6:29:09] <tamerlanethegreat> @Stoggaz I think all this game needs is a compelling story to complete the experience.
[6:29:10] <4thcore> Gameplay>graphics
[6:29:10] <%thewb32018> DOA needs more DOA physics Kappa
[6:29:10] <vintermalon> @Maximilian_DOOD but don't do you think that VF combat style would be to slow to some in this modern times?
[6:29:12] <codyppp1> @maximilian_dood can you reference Sega characters they should use? when I think Sega I think sonic lol
[6:29:14] <%Tetsuya5963> Boobs Simulator doodLewd
[6:29:14] <IcyXBlaze> doa just needs to double down on the booba
[6:29:15] <%Esper6476> DoA needs more "Physics" Kappa
[6:29:17] <%coingray> @RadicalHighway I kinda feel like maybe Virtual Fighter needs to do that too.
[6:29:18] <drunkenxlord> this looks super arcadey
[6:29:18] <%MAX116030> @Maximilian_DOOD Yakuza games has crazy martial arts you VF go that route?
[6:29:19] <fgc_splash> what new SYSTEM MECHANIC can they add? without ruin it claraaSip
[6:29:21] <+Applicationking> Doa can't remove the Booba, that's both what sells it, and holds it back
[6:29:22] <LindaStrikes> DOA basically lewd version of VF LUL
[6:29:23] <static_reaper115> just visual battle damage like MK9
[6:29:26] <%sae_what> DOA needs more DOODS doodLewd
[6:29:27] <+blaqrock> blaqrock subscribed with Prime. 
[6:29:29] <kobura57> Bring back Siba and the army man deleted for VF1
[6:29:29] <+314B2damac> please give us a story mode so we can get to know the character
[6:29:32] <%savagedrag00n> DOA needs more jiggle physics lol
[6:29:32] <%RushdownXIX> This game is pretty fast
[6:29:33] <%gamingchip0> add Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan LUL LUL LUL
[6:29:34] <%lionheartmoore_95> add in Ichiban from Yakuza 7 and Makoto from Persona 5 to Vf
[6:29:36] <+Dangerlocker> this game is too sick
[6:29:36] <%CyberneticHype> Dragon Engine might become Sega's RE engine @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:29:41] <+solidpeyo> DOA needs JESUS Kappa
[6:29:42] <Harv88> I was gonna say that, this looks more fluid than Tekken
[6:29:44] <%Dutchpotato> As a beginner this game feels insanely fast
[6:29:46] <%Kalzassa> @blaqrock doodDood doodSweet
[6:29:47] <Yoomazir> I can't see VF6 reinventing the wheel, especially now that pple are rediscovering VF5
[6:29:49] <%Adwark> @Kalzassa They gotta dispel mental connection of people of DoA=booba game, because more serious crowd pretty much skips it cuz of that.
[6:29:50] <%ChaosedStar> doa just needs better online and dlc practices
[6:29:50] <JDtG_Twitch> imo DOA has dug its own grave and it can stay there for all I care
[6:29:52] <mr_mean_one> <DOA needs more costumes
[6:29:54] <dovahkin2697> tekken is juggle city
[6:29:55] <%MrMidLife> @foxmonk they never will, that shit is what keeps the lights on.  Weebs spend cash.
[6:29:55] <%AnderMakk> is its online better than t 7?
[6:29:55] <%gamingchip0> also neo from the matrix
[6:29:56] <%applemon198> would getting it back in EVO main line up help?
[6:29:57] <%onilao> its cool to see matches always playing
[6:30:01] <%titanium_kyle> g2g so doodShine and have a good night doods! doodBro Stay safe everyone! doodGood solita1Kyo
[6:30:01] <OptimusCack> doa will never distance itself from it's tiddy fighter because it makes koei-tecmo too much money
[6:30:02] <%RushdownXIX> Casual players complain about speed all the time tho
[6:30:03] <+gophinobi23> A new DOA would outsell a new a new VF though as long as the lewdness is still there...no cap
[6:30:04] <EnSaru64> Combat is fine. Backgrounds needs to be a bit more lively
[6:30:05] <CarmineAcciai> It's 45 seconds compared to most games 99.
[6:30:07] <wellbornwarrior> @KingZai This. Fighting games were once showcases of what were technically possible and now they limb behind. Put in Raytracing, Global Illumination and all the other cutting edge stuff you can find in there.
[6:30:08] <+koey__> Most of the VF cast just isn't cool and emo like the Tekken cast...need more assholes like Goh
[6:30:11] <%brosencephalon> fire balls
[6:30:12] <%NyanKitzu> heat moves
[6:30:13] <+LastGambit> god plz no supers
[6:30:13] <%Aidonis> This Pai is nuts damn
[6:30:13] <+Nocturne_Noble> Gameplay is fine. It just needs ten years of marketing bias that Tekken got.
[6:30:13] <%sae_what> Naw VF doesn't need Supers or X Factor
[6:30:16] <+Chili_Daddy> Kiryu Majima Ryo lets go
[6:30:16] <ryukenchi> yes. pease no supers or comeback mechanics
[6:30:17] <tito_law> fireballs maybe
[6:30:17] <vintermalon> mmm okay
[6:30:18] <DNICE3838> yup
[6:30:19] <%ren0195> DOA needs to get into that mobile market and get those gatcha whales
[6:30:20] <x_art_of_life_x> It's a breath of fresh air to get away from insane juggle combos
[6:30:20] <Wiiplayah43> @nocturne_noble hell yeah, I bet the Yakuza team would love the chance
[6:30:21] <%buff_riku_says> gotta make the game recognizable to a newer audience
[6:30:23] <%onilao> you think stages should be changed or?
[6:30:23] <%blaqrock> blaqrock is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to Maximilian_DOOD's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel! 
[6:30:24] <%Dutchpotato> Like how tekken 7 added rage drives
[6:30:24] <%blaqrock> blaqrock gifted a Tier 1 sub to Syaraz! 
[6:30:24] <%blaqrock> blaqrock gifted a Tier 1 sub to boargooses! 
[6:30:24] <%blaqrock> blaqrock gifted a Tier 1 sub to LOLRUSS! 
[6:30:24] <%blaqrock> blaqrock gifted a Tier 1 sub to vorenndann! 
[6:30:24] <%blaqrock> blaqrock gifted a Tier 1 sub to phoenix_lily! 
[6:30:25] <+X4N_> Pai stole that shit
[6:30:25] <%Mattman162> plz no fireballs lol
[6:30:25] <+dragonphye> The way you can just rob a full round in VF is insane
[6:30:26] <tacticalnuke002> This Lau is bad at closing rounds
[6:30:26] <GilsoV> I find this way more pleasant to watch than the incessant headbobbing of Tekken's  korean backdash
[6:30:28] <0bani> Rage Arts?
[6:30:29] <%Adwark> @OptimusCack As we can see after they dropped support for DoA6 Kappa
[6:30:29] <%sae_what> doodDodge
[6:30:31] <Nizmei> NotLikeThis
[6:30:32] <kaito_kz> insta kills lets goo
[6:30:33] <%Supersonic540> Honestly, a story line could help in a casual market
[6:30:33] <ZoomstarR> hope it comes out for pc
[6:30:35] <tamerlanethegreat> @Adwark is DoA really going to be more appealing if the softcore is toned down?
[6:30:35] <%RushdownXIX> Since damage is high comebacks are likely
[6:30:39] <KhaosK_UL> good training mode a better one i would love it
[6:30:39] <Zcanzer> needs vtrigger
[6:30:40] <+MrNightmare0477> they need to add pro moves
[6:30:41] <+Dangerlocker> smh @ all the majinoHooksubs s in the chat saying it needs to be faster
[6:30:41] <Adanion> RentAHero fireballs are a must for VF6 Kappa
[6:30:42] <%Sulfur_Boride> If they did add in a Yakuza character, would they have to give him a Heat Gauge?
[6:30:43] <maxqowl> VF needs Akuma!
[6:30:44] <%sae_what> RETRO PAI CHAN
[6:30:44] <%AnderMakk> aw but i need to see an el blaze super with wwe all stars vibes
[6:30:44] <jakemuir> Think Sony might back 6 because of evo
[6:30:45] <+L3m0nTwi5t> Maybe add the supers from Tekken 7?
[6:30:46] <%Darq94> Tekken looks like a dance comp at high level LUL
[6:30:47] <+Owltosser> what about a mechanic where the last hit needs to do a certain amount of damage fora  ko? I always felt like a stub to the toe downing a person feels kind of weird
[6:30:50] <strawhatsamurai03> LUL
[6:30:50] <Mittmotto> What Virtua Fighter needs is a PC release LUL
[6:30:52] <%MrMidLife> @Maximilian_DOOD what about the "Stylish" controls that ArcSys Games used? would that help?
[6:30:52] <misternegative2010> @Maximilian_DOOD Do you feel like Soul Calibur is in a good place considering the environment of 3d fighting games
[6:30:53] <mcspyder> this is trippy
[6:30:54] <%indifference84> Maybe something like the Doom2016 reboot
[6:30:55] <fgc_splash> COMEBACK MECHANIC? CarlSmile
[6:30:56] <%onilao> i have like 4 i enjoy
[6:30:58] <blinkblank_> wtf that model
[6:30:59] <EQtheWolf> more destructible environments. dynamic gameplay
[6:30:59] <RaKazuto> how about story mode then? @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:31:00] <Yuber0> there is a lot of martial art they didn't exploit so, they have just to choose
[6:31:00] <FluffyMcBear> Fireball in VF??? WTH is this curse you bring upon us?
[6:31:00] <+m0tyf> @Maximilian_DOOD we need "gimmick" button, like Injustice LUL
[6:31:01] <andviceversa_> Supers gonna make the trailers more appealing
[6:31:03] <%OgGeek2016> One thing VF5 did get right is the AI. The CPU seems unbeatable sometimes.
[6:31:05] <prettystardoll> I like fighting vipers roster more
[6:31:07] <GreenShinobi26> I like ninjas and I like drunken fighters, guess what has both :) perfect roster
[6:31:08] <+gophinobi23> Stages are too basic in this game compared to DOA and Tekken for sure. But SC has basic stages too though
[6:31:08] <%canis_divinus> I think it's too grounded in reality
[6:31:08] <CurrySauseBandit> They look and have looked boring for tears imo
[6:31:10] <+AxeScythe> so needs more characters and guest characters
[6:31:14] <%MightySandwich> Terry Bogard is everywhere, all around us
[6:31:15] <greycreeze2345> The problem with the VF roster is that it isn't growing
[6:31:15] <%Programmed2k> Programmed2k subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[6:31:16] <%Kalzassa> @Adwark somewhat, but would they do that without toning down those things? Doubtful so fuck that and everything about it. Just need different DLC model as that is what most people complain about.
[6:31:17] <+ohKrypticc> yep these characters have been in my life for 2 days LUL I'm playing the game because its enjoyable SeemsGood
[6:31:19] <IKT36> guest characters?
[6:31:20] <03c63ef3> they probably shouldn't have let the series and characters decay so long stripSad
[6:31:20] <+solidpeyo> no
[6:31:22] <%TheChewyLemon> No
[6:31:22] <+Tsuzuriko> Nahh
[6:31:22] <%buff_riku_says> not really lol
[6:31:22] <%Kitsune826> nope
[6:31:23] <%puluxor> I don't find VF character designs particularily interesting or striking asakuraThink
[6:31:25] <+SuperKokuJin916> Gungrave, Gun Valkyrie, Otogi, Edge from Panzer Dragoon Saga!
[6:31:25] <RorBoy> only if it was all about Lau
[6:31:25] <Hericknhx> kinda Kappa
[6:31:25] <%indifference84> something the celebrates the roots of the series while taking a step forward
[6:31:26] <%kewlmyc> Wouldn't really care
[6:31:27] <%xenocraigmorph> Pulling from the Yakuza series would be pretty good.
[6:31:27] <Kyllaruna> @fgc_splash they already have it and it's called Ring Out LUL
[6:31:27] <%qtgothwaifu> GIVE SARAH A GUN
[6:31:27] <DataMaru> I agree. The only memorable cast for me is Akira, and I know VF since VF1 LUL
[6:31:28] <ButtHashEnthusiast> nope
[6:31:28] <+Applicationking> Or at least new design philosophies, KoF has cool normal looking characters. VF looks just kinda boring
[6:31:28] <%ULTRA__64> Honestly, not really
[6:31:29] <+Squega> Maybe a Ryu/Chun Li crossover? It worked for Power Rangers. LUL
[6:31:29] <+jjmain_> it's gonna need a marie rose
[6:31:29] <%canis_divinus> like people want excitement and over the top
[6:31:29] <+Netmonmatt> yo that defense
[6:31:29] <+314B2damac> Story mode would help.  make and over the top story and let the characters be a meme
[6:31:29] <%UnluckySpade7> LUL LUL
[6:31:30] <+天使42199> @tamerlanethegreat they tried toning down DoA but then people will complain that they are giving in to the sjws. Still I think at this point DoA would need a soft reboot.
[6:31:30] <Stoggaz> nope
[6:31:33] <%sae_what> Naw, not with classic VF characters
[6:31:33] <%TheOGB> has VF ever had a story???
[6:31:34] <ryukenchi> it has an anime though
[6:31:35] <Leodash_> Dark Souls x Virtua Fighter?
[6:31:36] <%AnderMakk> give me a tekken guest character
[6:31:36] <xveratusx> No sadly
[6:31:36] <%MightySandwich> I'd be way more excited for Quest Mode coming back
[6:31:36] <%MrMidLife> @Maximilian_DOOD It's called  Shenmue :)
[6:31:37] <+FrostParaselene> Virtua Fighter with a story mode LUL
[6:31:37] <%NaSh_kRaP> some
[6:31:39] <pepePiccolo> Bloody Roar and Rival Schools is all I want @maximilian_dood GlitchCat
[6:31:40] <ElderLion91> They get lucky or they don't. its a fighting game. i dont see anything giving them a boost in players.
[6:31:41] <%Brogox> Wall grabs, wall breaks and ring outs are selling point to me in this case.
[6:31:41] <%lowpolybreakfast> I love vf, and I still think the roster is boring af
[6:31:41] <+brandobrandoi> PC port will get me to play
[6:31:41] <cheetah1546> story modes in fighting games are often not the best
[6:31:41] <IlGodot> anime story modeee
[6:31:41] <EtherNigh> VF character is like too basic and one sided
[6:31:41] <Wiiplayah43> @maximilian_dood yes if it's written by the Yakuza team
[6:31:41] <%LocalAlienParty> people don't care about the already established story and anime lmao
[6:31:42] <AlanBolte> If DoA's thing is pandering, just replace the roster with Twitch streamers
[6:31:43] <%HuntingHornPete> Maybe the next step would be what modern martial arts movies did like in Crouching Tiger. Still in the realm of martial arts but exaggerated for the hook.
[6:31:43] <industry_> they need a whole bunch of original characters, VF4 was huge because it introduced cool new characters like Vanessa
[6:31:45] <%Adwark> @tamerlanethegreat That's challenge honestly. Because core gameplay at DoA is GOOD. It has actually fun fighting system that can stand on its own
[6:31:45] <%ren0195> no
[6:31:47] <SourShock> ehhh not really no LUL
[6:31:47] <%onilao> could have like guest charecters
[6:31:47] <drunkenxlord> reliable servers for online play
[6:31:48] <DNICE3838> no
[6:31:48] <bryllun> Should SEGA go 3D or 2D? @maximilian_dood
[6:31:48] <Yoomazir> I would, hell I watched that VF anime LUL
[6:31:48] <@Belutima> Tag Mechanic, and Tag Combos. is what I want to see.
[6:31:50] <+L3m0nTwi5t> They could steal the slow-mo and super arts from Tekken 7. I mean Tekken has taken so much from VF already.
[6:31:52] <%yeknomlive> put in shenmue boy
[6:31:53] <+mrcassidyart> feel like I'm watching DOA now. :)
[6:31:53] <dovahkin2697> vf has an anime
[6:31:54] <JUJUxANONY> Yakuza but VF characters?
[6:31:54] <samoori117> @maximilian_dood Yakuza protagonists?
[6:31:54] <SFWOWR> More ala carte customization with styles and looks?
[6:31:55] <x_art_of_life_x> It has a story? NotLikeThis
[6:31:56] <+Nocturne_Noble> Yes, if written by the Yakuza team.
[6:31:58] <%RushdownXIX> Just add Kiryu and Karuga and we got people buying it
[6:31:58] <NeetKiller> I like DOA and Tekken more, VF roster just seems boring to me
[6:31:59] <+Mr_Panda> i dont even like tekken story mode, i just wanted tekken force with online ranking and more customization options
[6:32:00] <+Owltosser> wait VF5 had a story? Kappa
[6:32:00] <Slaythe> @Maximilian_DOOD so you think they should add streets of rage, yakura, shenmu characters ?
[6:32:01] <+m0tyf> @Maximilian_DOOD story mode with Sarah as main character Kreygasm
[6:32:01] <orihalchon> I think VF is unique among other FGs today because it's still very raw - no gimmicks, no supers etc
[6:32:01] <%insertcorythere> i feel like the characters are just representatives of their styles, instead of being characters themselves.
[6:32:01] <kevamadi> I guess the issue is that VF's characters have no real appeal outside of nostalgia...
[6:32:01] <andviceversa_> just watch the animeeeee
[6:32:02] <A_m_v_J> How does this play on a hitbox controller?
[6:32:03] <WeirdLab> @Maximilian_DOOD  Slightly update the engine of VF5, put a few new character, and call it VF6, release it as a free to play of some sort on PC
[6:32:04] <%TokenBlackDood> VF5 is about a guy wanting to kill a shark Kappa
[6:32:05] <OptimusCack> tbf sega never cared about vf's story either
[6:32:05] <%RushdownXIX> No need to pay for extra stuff either
[6:32:05] <%AnderMakk> akuma pls
[6:32:05] <%Kitsune826> uhh evil coporation is bad?
[6:32:08] <Zamzeed> Virtua Fighter anime is pretty good
[6:32:08] <%kazen01> they need to add yakuza characters since they are better known now
[6:32:09] <%Aidonis> @Maximilian_DOOD They should be the first to introduce player run tournaments in the game client imo
[6:32:10] <%Sulfur_Boride> Maybe make new characters from cultures and with fighting styles not really done before in fighting games or are uncommon?
[6:32:11] <zhuravli> Ah i know.. DOA should be back in evo
[6:32:11] <%McNere> I assumed it didn't have a story. It seems like such a pure fighting game
[6:32:11] <+AxeScythe> Shun Di throws Akira into a Volcano LUL
[6:32:12] <+aroo27> in the year 2692, the Virtua Corporation created the Fighter Serum..
[6:32:14] <KhaosK_UL> would a tower mode be better?
[6:32:14] <%sae_what> THAT WALL JUMP
[6:32:15] <+TheGeekthulhu> That was always VF's weakness. I think it has interesting looking characters, but the problem is that they aren't fleshed out with story.
[6:32:15] <favadem> give VF a super dash button
[6:32:16] <%onilao> sick
[6:32:17] <misternegative2010> Virtua Fighter needs story mode like Fighting Ex Layer. There really is no story.
[6:32:20] <%Darkseid99> How is the online?
[6:32:21] <TheAruarian> Saeijima would be pretty much a Jeffrey skin, tho
[6:32:21] <Zcanzer> add street of rage characters and do it's own vf force made
[6:32:21] <%blaqrock> @Maximilian_DOOD Just wanted to say you helped me a lot helped me a lot growin up, long story short was a problem child but after watching you i got into fighting games and it helped me control my anger, I wanted to thank you with the 5 subs, sorry I couldn't give more
[6:32:21] <%Zephyrbal> VF X KOF
[6:32:25] <Autaki> should also add the Judgement characters too in VF
[6:32:25] <subterfudgeandstrategery> wasn't shenmue supposed to be a virtua fighter rpg early on?
[6:32:27] <+neonxaos> Well... according to the Tekken data, story mode is surprisingly high on people's lists. Competitive players just want completely different things.
[6:32:28] <@Nightbot> Check out NZXT’s newest Starter PC series! An excellent first gaming PC--perfect for school work and working from home while maintaining great gaming performance. Built and shipped within 48 hours with a 2-year warranty. http://nzxt.co/SPC_MaxChat
[6:32:29] <DaKnightWarrior> Something about an evil shark.
[6:32:31] <%VZLABoi> @Belutima  I think you want that 8v8 super deathmatch for every game.... doodDerp
[6:32:31] <pixel_river> brawl had a story mode on par with mk9 i think
[6:32:32] <+X4N_> @Maximilian_DOOD  Who are the characters that would need to stay if they did new characters?
[6:32:32] <%puluxor> I have no idea what VF's story is either, and I've passively absorbed many other fighting game's stories
[6:32:34] <%sae_what> Kiryu can't hit women
[6:32:34] <JDtG_Twitch> Yeah this game could use some actual lore
[6:32:38] <%lionheartmoore_95> maybe Ichiban from Yakuza 7
[6:32:38] <%CyberneticHype> Casuals see Tekken's massive roster and because of it will continue go towards it more @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:32:39] <malla_othman> HAPPY BIRTHDAY mallaoJujutsu
[6:32:40] <%NaSh_kRaP> atpRtsd1
[6:32:41] <0bani> NotLikeThis
[6:32:43] <%quique_schz> let them adopt the yakuza name, make vf6 somethin like yakuza: virtua fighter
[6:32:43] <%Tetsuya5963> yes
[6:32:44] <kaixno> Akiyama and Majima
[6:32:44] <%applemon198> one of the stories is just one of them beat Akira and then he beat them back and now they are facing each other again in this tournament and thats it
[6:32:45] <geilepapabeer007> a storymode would easily grab my attention honestly
[6:32:45] <kobura57> No super, no meter, no comeback mechanic... in VF please
[6:32:46] <Wiiplayah43> @maximilian_dood only specified kiryu
[6:32:47] <%Adwark> @Kalzassa Different DLC model. But what kind? Selling costumes allowing players to actually access most of content without additional payments failed. What other paths they have there?
[6:32:48] <FaIIenDark> @Maximilian_DOOD Just bring Majima
[6:32:48] <+天使42199> Kiryu can't hit women Kappa
[6:32:48] <%yeknomlive> kiryu slapped the shit out of haruka tho
[6:32:50] <%SquirrelZOD> Ichiban, however, has no problem beating a woman with a bat, so go with him!
[6:32:50] <%Fuukoji> I know that Pai
[6:32:52] <%kewlmyc> KIRYU CAN'T HIT WOMEN, unless they're his daughter
[6:32:52] <DuskyNito> LUL
[6:32:53] <%thewb32018> LOL
[6:32:53] <RaKazuto> Kiryu cant kill people too
[6:32:53] <Igalimax> they could also do redesigns of the cast similar to strive to make the existing characters more interesting as well
[6:32:55] <+Sazre> Majima, Ryo, Axel Stone
[6:32:55] <NDUDE> Well there goes Kiryu in Smash. :V
[6:32:55] <dgv88> Nice lore there LUL
[6:32:56] <%Deyrax69> what? atpCap
[6:32:56] <%xenocraigmorph> Fair enough. Kiryu doesn't kill *cough*
[6:32:56] <tacticalnuke002> Just know that Kage is the main character, Lei wants to kill Lau, Dural is Kage's mom. Everyone else is just participating in the tournament
[6:32:56] <tamerlanethegreat> @L3m0nTwi5t Tekken slow-mo is honestly a big turn-off for me. Super-arts is a consideration, though.
[6:32:57] <+Reformed_Bugz> Honestly I think this game need a battle royal
[6:32:57] <holeecrab> except haruka
[6:32:58] <Yoomazir> Kiryu's a gentleman
[6:32:59] <%bruce_lee_roy420> That’s dumb
[6:32:59] <+MEGAMANZEROWIL> for me yhe game will perfect that it have more dega game characters and make the fighter have a  super special like similar to tekken 7 and soul calibur 6 and that will be perfect because if they dont do that the game get boring and stale so fast and they need to put ending for every characters
[6:33:01] <WolfenHeiger> but slaps Haruka in Yakuza 1
[6:33:04] <+BigWaldo7713> yagami from judgment could work too
[6:33:05] <%7heAsura> Wassup @Maximilian_DOOD and chat hope everyone is well
[6:33:05] <JayVoDaKingTV> All they need to do is add GEESE and Rock Howard in VF story @maximilian_dood
[6:33:06] <violisto> maybe they could put in the new protagonist from Y7
[6:33:07] <%bruce_lee_roy420> Those devs are strnage
[6:33:07] <SFWOWR> Streets of Rage still Sega's?
[6:33:07] <Xaimou> but thats the weird thing kiryu is in project x zone 2 and he hits women
[6:33:08] <CarmineAcciai> Majima would work perfectly.
[6:33:08] <ponytafail354> @sae_what majima can LUL
[6:33:09] <%Mistsumai> same applies for majima
[6:33:09] <cheetah1546> omg i used to main vanessa
[6:33:09] <%LocalAlienParty> much of the yakuza irl is supposed to be polite and not do stuff like that apparently
[6:33:10] <%NoesNobody> Ryo would be cool guest
[6:33:10] <SourShock> PrideLaugh Kiryu LuvSign
[6:33:10] <%Kitsune826> but he can slap a child
[6:33:11] <OniBerserker> a yakuza like game with vf story and characters would be awesome
[6:33:11] <garfield_fuel> just have the model switch to Majima whenever the opponent is a woman
[6:33:11] <orihalchon> Ichiban would be great
[6:33:12] <GreenShinobi26> a Shun! PogChamp
[6:33:12] <%onilao> you like any of the females on this max?
[6:33:12] <+314B2damac> why havent they put Ryo from Shenmue in the game?
[6:33:12] <%CyberneticHype> @Maximilian_DOOD Just joined, how's your online experience been so far?
[6:33:13] <@Belutima> @VZLABoi no vf is fine without that
[6:33:13] <+Chili_Daddy> bruh he slapped the shit out of his daughter LUL
[6:33:14] <CoffeeDeus> Kiryu = Sanji?
[6:33:15] <RorBoy> get a tennis player from Virtua Tennis in there
[6:33:15] <%Vffvx90> but he did in yakuza in a sidequest LUL LUL
[6:33:15] <blendedcamo> Damn. Kiryu dont mess around
[6:33:15] <%sae_what> Kiryu never killed anyone Kappa
[6:33:15] <codyppp1> @maximilian_dood would you do a dream list of sega characters for this game?
[6:33:16] <xdarkshiftx> but it's non-canon?
[6:33:17] <BlueBloodBlues> isnt the same chat
[6:33:17] <+TheGeekthulhu> MY MAN!
[6:33:17] <+messydn> zoomer devs
[6:33:19] <%yeknomlive> put in haruka
[6:33:19] <%Qblackman34> but kiryu slapped a girl
[6:33:20] <%TheGreatVizandu> Get Ichiban in there!
[6:33:20] <FluffyMcBear> I want Yagami from Judgement for VF
[6:33:23] <%AnderMakk> you know who this game needs? frank west LUL
[6:33:24] <%thewb32018> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:33:25] <MoonSorcery> could be Goro. he doesn't seem to give a fuck about anything.
[6:33:26] <%onilao> flare would be sick
[6:33:26] <skullhead51x> what if kiryu swaps out to another character when fighting against a female character LUL
[6:33:28] <Dan_The_Noob> as a person who has dabbled in fighting games mostly but never dived in on Virtua Fighter... it's because it doesn't feel like it has special moves. where Tekken had quirky/goofy moves but still a grounded feel
[6:33:28] <%Adwark> @Kalzassa Character DLCs which also tonnes of people complain?
[6:33:28] <+AxeScythe> streets of rage characters in VF would be nice
[6:33:29] <thenoble_ali> Ridiculous lol
[6:33:29] <inua_yuta> Do you think Tekken might ever colab with VF?
[6:33:32] <%Bholorak> no put blaze in there
[6:33:33] <+EverybodyHasAPryce> Blaze Fielding
[6:33:33] <%blaqrock> Im going to bed but hope you seen my last message, catch ya round max
[6:33:33] <Funkyguy321> what about a weapon character. just some dude with a knife or swords
[6:33:33] <+Mr_Panda> vanessa is super brutal
[6:33:34] <+PJVulpino> Super powers?
[6:33:34] <%onyxlighthouse> true!
[6:33:35] <%Frizen_101> Kiryu respects women
[6:33:35] <%onilao> blaze i mean
[6:33:36] <jaycreatives> SEEEGGAAAAA
[6:33:37] <ElderLion91> If we want to help then we need to play them and talk about them more. this feels more in the hands of the fans than anything imo
[6:33:37] <+98iori> can use yakuza 7 protag
[6:33:40] <EnSaru64> too ragey
[6:33:40] <%Kalzassa> @Adwark one word, Fortnite. Just do a battle pass/get stuff for playing after you pay that small fee.
[6:33:40] <Autaki> @Maximilian_DOOD Add the Yakuza spin off game, Judgement characters too?
[6:33:41] <%thewb32018> Thats a good thought
[6:33:42] <+Nocturne_Noble> None.
[6:33:43] <artman747> blaze
[6:33:43] <Anthlon> Beat from Jet Set Radio
[6:33:45] <+neonxaos> No one knows SoR either
[6:33:45] <PKcritical> insert blaze, lets do it
[6:33:45] <+TheZiggyStar> Virtua Cop in Virtua For ghter
[6:33:47] <OptimusCack> max, if there's one sega franchise more neglected than vf it's streets of rage
[6:33:47] <%Ry_ceratops> SHE JUST BEAT UP THAT OLD GUY
[6:33:48] <%Brunty023> Chat, most of you are forgetting that Yagami is a better fit
[6:33:48] <+aroo27> Ichiban, Majima, Lao Gui
[6:33:48] <%ReformedPervert> Ryo Hazuki
[6:33:48] <%Kaito_Cam> because they special moves
[6:33:49] <+MrNightmare0477> idk for me something big has to happen for the future. vf vs tekken maybe maybe a char in smash idk but roster needs a revamp
[6:33:50] <DJ_is_Raiden> yo shiba in vf lets goo
[6:33:51] <+Netmonmatt> clean
[6:33:52] <maxqowl> Blaze would be sick
[6:33:52] <lastofusspoil> many reasons
[6:33:52] <+Tsuzuriko> @Maximilian_DOOD now that they own Atlus, same goes for Persona. If they can be in Smash, why not VF?
[6:33:53] <+LastGambit> axel stone wins via cop artillery
[6:33:53] <kakashihunter99> Insert here Kiryu slapping Haruka gif.
[6:33:53] <%Blazeblue> Deep down we all want a new Sonic the Fighters
[6:33:53] <Kobukson> shinobi characters
[6:33:53] <%ayekevo555> this Vanessa is crazy
[6:33:54] <Harv88> hell yeah max, on point with that one
[6:33:56] <+X4N_> yes, gimme Blaze
[6:33:56] <%sae_what> Yeyeyey esp the SoR4 characters
[6:33:56] <RaKazuto> The raid character should be in too
[6:33:57] <Mittmotto> How about porting the VF engine to a Phantasy Star fighting game?
[6:33:59] <%savagedrag00n> Axel would be perfect, and help appeal to the western audience
[6:34:00] <juicyjhuz> put one of the 2 crude dudes in there LUL
[6:34:01] <%NaSh_kRaP> Axel atpQuan
[6:34:01] <Wiiplayah43> @wolfenheiger you could chalk that up to "early installment weirdness"
[6:34:01] <%applemon198> Axl would be a weird grappling brawler combo
[6:34:01] <%Sulfur_Boride> Would it bring in enough newcomers that are Streets of Rage fans?
[6:34:03] <pr1me_778> Majima ban be in this game as a comic relief
[6:34:03] <wellbornwarrior> Streets of Rage isn't exactly the new hot stuff that attract people either.
[6:34:04] <bryllun> Can they be in 2D or 3D?
[6:34:05] <fgc_splash> EL BLAZE VS BLAZE
[6:34:05] <P4GamerFreak> #sanicinvf
[6:34:05] <DaKnightWarrior> I would love that.
[6:34:06] <%RushdownXIX> Funny how putting a Mishima in the game would probably make them the easiest character to play lol
[6:34:06] <RyuekanS> Add Sketch Turner from Comix Zone to Virtua Fighter! :D
[6:34:06] <Vulcan422> I'd play Blaze and Shiva if they got added
[6:34:06] <ElSuperNova> LUL hit em with the bnb
[6:34:07] <%linne_inverse> I want a PSO Fighter with Sonic Knuckles
[6:34:09] <%CyberneticHype> Virtua Fighter should become Sega's KOF in terms of roster @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:34:10] <%LocalAlienParty> sega characters as skins
[6:34:10] <%onilao> and each streets of rage charecter has diffrent fight style
[6:34:10] <%xenocraigmorph> And use classic boss stages from SoR and use them as arenas
[6:34:10] <A_m_v_J> More sparkle effects
[6:34:11] <ZoomstarR> sonic mabe
[6:34:13] <x_art_of_life_x> Damn dude, Vanessa is BRUTAL
[6:34:13] <@NicoB7700> alright doods, I'm heading out for the night, have a good one! doodShine @Maximilian_DOOD

[6:34:14] <%captinlazerface> PowerStone
[6:34:14] <SirYamms> Knuckles lol
[6:34:15] <%ReformedPervert> Shenmue
[6:34:17] <%MAX116030> Because Street of Rage has shoryken and fireballs etc Kappa
[6:34:18] <+TheGeekthulhu> This Shun made me sad. I love this character.
[6:34:19] <GreenShinobi26> Shinobi would be great
[6:34:19] <%MrMidLife> Beat from Jet Set Radio Vs. Picky from Fighting Vipers.  FIGHT!
[6:34:19] <%MarKellZC> I’m diggin this Vanessa
[6:34:20] <+Applicationking> just make it smashbros, get mario in there
[6:34:20] <industry_> the problem with other sega characters is that it's still just playing on nostalgia, they need something that speaks to a new generation of gamers
[6:34:20] <taufikjay> Totally
[6:34:21] <Zerixar> Dr robotnik as a grappler...
[6:34:21] <DarknessD42> Give me Ulala Kreygasm
[6:34:23] <RorBoy> Segata Sanshiro and a Virtua Tennis player
[6:34:25] <%buff_riku_says> Knuckles
[6:34:25] <%j_feezyy> Spikeout character would be cool.
[6:34:25] <%sae_what> You could add the Daytona car again LUL
[6:34:25] <Slaythe> @wellbornwarrior dude it sold over 2 millions lol
[6:34:26] <greycreeze2345> Should they do the KOF route and make a fighters megamix series instead?
[6:34:26] <imdengetsu> Sonic in VF
[6:34:28] <%thewb32018> Shinobi would be so awesome
[6:34:30] <DNICE3838> or final fight  fighter
[6:34:31] <+Arngrinn> give us some phantasy star characters
[6:34:31] <%skynja> like yoda in SC
[6:34:31] <%0Renegade4> put some respek on joe musashi's name
[6:34:32] <Dan_The_Noob> put sonic boom knuckles in with  wing chun LUL
[6:34:33] <Javek1908> I wonder if there is a way to combine the servers they are using in this delay netcode and rollback netcode?
[6:34:33] <+EverybodyHasAPryce> Or Dr Eggman lmao
[6:34:34] <andviceversa_> small hitbox character, ewww
[6:34:34] <%Kalzassa> @Adwark same thing for DLC characters really, but I mean every single fighting game does that so saying that is it's issue is like saying it's a problem with every fighting game having that. so why single it out.
[6:34:34] <+Has_TTV> you can literally see where tekken have taken inspo
[6:34:34] <+MEGAMANZEROWIL> even put alterer beast ,shinobi even hibana from nightshade

[6:34:38] <Zcanzer> Ground Upper !
[6:34:38] <nanoriped> Shenmue characters
[6:34:38] <+kalibrations> I think fighting game devs are missing out from studying how people drop in real fights on the street and having the players do that in game
[6:34:39] <Leodash_> Gon in Tekken 3
[6:34:39] <+Hitpawz> Have an Altered Beast guy that transforms
[6:34:40] <%savagedrag00n> Knuckles
[6:34:40] <Nuzence> VF is a realistic fighter

[6:34:44] <FreeLawX> beat from jet set radio Kappa
[6:34:44] <%AnderMakk> vf6 needs an audio overhaul for sure, the sound design in this game is atrocious

[6:34:49] <Adanion> Ulala would be fun too
[6:34:50] <%Sylphy_TV> No fun allowed
[6:34:50] <43birdie> they need to add majima

[6:34:58] <+ShinABK> virtua quest 2
[6:34:58] <%Kitsune826> @Maximilian_DOOD there's so many fighting styles not in vf that could make weird characters. does vf have a capoeira character?
[6:34:59] <+Nocturne_Noble> Last Bronx was another series that had the depth of VF with far more gloss/story. It was just so niche...
[6:35:01] <RaKazuto> like GON in tekken 3 ... right?, whats wrong sega
[6:35:01] <%thewb32018> @NicoB7700 Goodnight and take care doodBro doodBro doodShine doodShine

[6:35:10] <%CyberneticHype> Sega's KOF, but not necesary team based @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:35:10] <Storm_Samurai> I am borrowing this vanessa costume design right now
[6:35:12] <%Haxorquazar> Segata Sanshiro
[6:35:13] <ZoomstarR> they could have the roster from the baki anime maybe
[6:35:16] <fgc_splash> add ARMOR MOVES for VF6, as a comeback mechanic claraaHug
[6:35:17] <EtherNigh> Persona character for vf lets go
[6:35:17] <+brandobrandoi> SEGATA SANSHIRO SEGATA SANSHIRO
[6:35:18] <partyponypalooza> TOE JAM and EARL
[6:35:19] <JDtG_Twitch> We need to keep vf and crazy bullshit separate imo
[6:35:20] <%Senju_in_Japan> Hey set radio on the wall
[6:35:20] <%buff_riku_says> Zangief could be in the game with capcom cooperation
[6:35:24] <PanosZync7> RGG studio loves doing "dumb" stuff in Yakuza so making Sega characters like this wouldn't be out of the ordinary for them
[6:35:28] <PleasingAroma> Virtual Fighter Seven
[6:35:28] <SirCold_> If they wanted to keep it realistic they could add sonic costume pieces
[6:35:30] <%Senju_in_Japan> Jet set radio
[6:35:30] <Slaythe> @Maximilian_DOOD did you see the Shiva DLC character for streets of rage 4 ? He would be insane in Virtua Fighter
[6:35:31] <RorBoy> The Virtua Fighter
[6:35:31] <Harv88> jet set radio, someone on roller blades moving around , like a Lucio from Overwatch etc.
[6:35:31] <shikimagura> it's more that there might not be any people who would remember those IPs are things they own
[6:35:31] <pixel_river> reboot
[6:35:34] <masterp1e> virtua cop charaters @maximilian_dood
[6:35:35] <%TheOGB> Virtua Fighters Megamix
[6:35:36] <%cyndetsu> cyndetsu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! hey doods
[6:35:37] <KaiZer_2049> !ads
[6:35:37] <kobura57> But it's also fine that VF is a boomer game lol not everything has to be for kid or casual
[6:35:37] <codyppp1> @maximilian_dood  they could put eternal champion

[6:35:37] <%semiiotic> a reboot
[6:35:38] <+Chili_Daddy> Virtua Fighter INFINITE LETS GOO LUL
[6:35:38] <+Applicationking> Virtua fighter new genesis
[6:35:39] <EnSaru64> "THE VIRTUA FIGHTER"
[6:35:39] <AMIdDST> I really like the fact that this game is based on grounded martial arts and NO SUPER attacks. Fucking SICK. I want more of this stuff.
[6:35:40] <%midnightspecials> REBOOT
[6:35:40] <cheesers> but i want vf 6 :(
[6:35:41] <orihalchon> VIRTUAL FIGHTER INFINITE

[6:35:44] <%thewb32018> doodLewd doodLewd doodLewd
[6:35:45] <+天使42199> reboot
[6:35:45] <JayVoDaKingTV> Shenmue definitely
[6:35:47] <kevamadi> VF seems to take its character-balancing VERY seriously, seeing as they've never added more than 2 characters for any iteration...
[6:35:47] <%LocalAlienParty> a soulcalibur or samsho reboot would work wonders
[6:35:48] <+boosh5> It needs something. As it stands, VF doesn't have a definable thing to make it stand out to a casual fan like me.
[6:35:48] <+EverybodyHasAPryce> They could put in a Persona Character also. Or go waaaay off the wall, how about a Crazy Taxi driver?
[6:35:49] <Alexm305> @Haxorquazar no not that please Megaman in sfxt still has me heated LUL
[6:35:50] <%Qblackman34> ryo shenmue
[6:35:50] <andviceversa_> like samurai showdown
[6:35:51] <Nuzence> @jdtg_twitch exactly i don't think the two should mix
[6:35:52] <wellbornwarrior> @Slaythe If you ask random people somewhere on the internet they probably couldn't even tell you the names of the main characters without googling.
[6:35:53] <DJ_is_Raiden> no, just make a new megamix
[6:35:58] <Wiiplayah43> @jdtg_twitch the lack of craziness was part of what killed it for a decade
[6:35:59] <+solidpeyo> adding a 6 will spook new players
[6:35:59] <kaito_kz> virtua fighter new dawn
[6:36:01] <prettystardoll> Infinite
[6:36:01] <MyteeWun> Virtual Fighter Z
[6:36:03] <%onilao> big brains
[6:36:04] <Anthlon> Get Joker from Persona 5 PogChamp
[6:36:04] <maohayato> all these people shitting on the dlc of DOA but are happy to buy DLC for other games. smh my head
[6:36:06] <%the_smiler_in_the_dark> @Maximilian_DOOD they should add Frank west to VF5 to make him the Negan of this game LUL
[6:36:06] <%TheDarkKnight774> Virtual Fighter Megamix
[6:36:08] <%skynja> and guess what? mk9 was huge
[6:36:08] <theramazing27> like killer instinct?
[6:36:09] <%Qblackman34> what about shenmue chars
[6:36:09] <%fancyfantasy> like the soulcalibur treatment?
[6:36:09] <blendedcamo> Virtual FighterZ
[6:36:11] <Funkyguy321> "Sega's" virtual fighter and put more sega characters
[6:36:12] <%fighting_games_fan5555> Virtua Fighter infinite LUL
[6:36:12] <+314B2damac> put the DJ from jet set radio in
[6:36:12] <+aroo27> rebooted, then went straight back to numbers LUL
[6:36:15] <GreenShinobi26> Fighters Megamix 2! PogChamp
[6:36:15] <%DreamPhantasyTV> ooo they should add baki the grappler in VF
[6:36:16] <ShaunStyfer> Vitrua Fighter Infinite
[6:36:16] <ThaddTheInhaler> calling out soul calibur?
[6:36:16] <+ShadowScorpion> Damn that Shun comeback
[6:36:16] <%Adwark> @Kalzassa Overall as I think of it... I dunno for some reason none of those models really feel suitable. Maybe if you done that Battle Pass thing in Halo Master Chief Collection, where these battle passes are NOT time limited.
[6:36:17] <DaKnightWarrior> Virtual The Fighter.
[6:36:17] <fgc_splash> VIRTUE ALL FIGHTERS CarlSmile
[6:36:18] <kayosugoi> Virtua Fighter Rematch
[6:36:20] <OptimusCack> they should make the goofy new vf, but rebrand it as "virtual fighter"
[6:36:20] <+RamenRider> Virtual Fighters Battle for the Grid
[6:36:21] <%abinadab01> Vanessa moves like dragonovf
[6:36:21] <+TheGeekthulhu> Let's go Shun!
[6:36:22] <Yar_Holmes> Virtua Fighter Infinite
[6:36:22] <EtherNigh> @maximilian_dood big numerical number could scare people off
[6:36:24] <%Zephyrbal> @Maximilian_DOOD Sega is also a huge publisher now with properties all over the industry. They could draw from a lot of that stuff
[6:36:25] <%MarKellZC> Jeeesseeeuuusss
[6:36:26] <PanosZync7> Virtua Fighter Kiwami
[6:36:27] <%sae_what> Maybe reboot as Super Virtua Fighter
[6:36:28] <PleasingAroma> hua
[6:36:28] <%onilao> i love the fighting on this game
[6:36:31] <RorBoy> SUPER megamix
[6:36:32] <+X4N_> Then you get VF 7?
[6:36:32] <+Mr_Panda> old man is angry
[6:36:33] <%Qblackman34> what about shenmue ppl
[6:36:34] <%coingray> Maybe Virtua Fighter shouldn't chase an appeal it doesn't naturally have?
[6:36:35] <Doomshine> Virtua Fighter: Origins
[6:36:35] <%asgard147> Virtual Fighter: Rising Sun
[6:36:36] <%MarKellZC> That’s what makes this game great tho
[6:36:37] <tamerlanethegreat> @Maximilian_DOOD How about rebooting it with a story about fighters' consciousnesses trapped in VR, thus 'Virtua Fighter'?
[6:36:37] <CarmineAcciai> I love that this series has a drunken boxer.
[6:36:42] <Kobukson> segata sanshiro
[6:36:43] <Zephyrus0> @Maximilian_DOOD Real talk, sega needs to add Yakuza, Shenmue and Streets of Rage characters to VF
[6:36:44] <+Applicationking> Virtue Fighter and knuckles

[6:36:49] <partyponypalooza> Virtua Fighter New Genesis

[6:36:59] <+Nocturne_Noble> Thanks for giving this beloved series some great press!
[6:37:02] <wellbornwarrior> Now that it's mentioned, Negan already set a precedent. Just get Shang Chi from Marvel or something similiar popular.
[6:37:02] <DJ_is_Raiden> NO
[6:37:04] <Wiiplayah43> @maohayato you are COMPLETELY missing the point about DoA dlc
[6:37:06] <%Zephyrbal> Total War: Virtua Fighter
[6:37:09] <JDtG_Twitch> @ndude yeah i think they do
[6:37:10] <Qvoth> fuudo said shun di at 10 drinks and above is the strongest character in the game
[6:37:10] <favadem> does sega have the rights to the persona characters?
[6:37:10] <+天使42199> @maximilian_dood should they keep classic 90s aesthetic and music if they reboot it or modern it up
[6:37:12] <kobura57> Virtua Fighter Strive LUL
[6:37:14] <+314B2damac> Yes SeGATA!
[6:37:14] <Zcanzer> vf6 should have a blacklists

[6:37:20] <blanethebrain> add alien and Ripley from alien isolation lol
[6:37:20] <%Fuukoji> yes
[6:37:22] <%CyberneticHype> Sega needs their own Shatter Your Expactations @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:37:24] <fgc_splash> I want VIRTUA TENNIS! claraaRage
[6:37:24] <%RushdownXIX> I do not think that Bayonetta would work in this game
[6:37:25] <%Senju_in_Japan> Shinmue guy
[6:37:26] <%RadicalHighway> they have bayo 1 right just not bayo 2 or 3 iirc
[6:37:26] <%TheOGB> yeah it's that Jacky!
[6:37:27] <%Kitsune826> that flip is disgusting, it looks like him
[6:37:27] <+Rayzor_G> yes
[6:37:27] <%LocalAlienParty> the yakuza guys did a fist of the north star game so maybe throw him in too
[6:37:31] <Hericknhx> oh yeah, Capita something
[6:37:33] <+SAQUIC228> They did release that list of IPs they still consider a priority to get back into new games
[6:37:33] <%Adwark> @favadem They own Atlus which made Persona series so yes.
[6:37:33] <+neonxaos> I have wanted to play as Bayonetta in a fighting game that isn't Smash for so long
[6:37:38] <%Deyrax69> Bayonetta is NIntendont now atpFeelsBeardMan
[6:37:39] <Osamovic77> is this guile Kappa
[6:37:40] <%thewb32018> Straight up animal
[6:37:41] <+TheGeekthulhu> What did you think of VF4? @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:37:42] <Doomshine> this isn't Rip
[6:37:43] <Harv88> wtb Genjuro for VF5R
[6:37:44] <JUJUxANONY> Beyonetta was in Anarchy Reigns
[6:37:45] <KazuyaYakuza> Super Ultra Virtua Fighter 5: Turbo Championship Edition v2025
[6:37:45] <43birdie> *ahem* SMASH 4 BAYO
[6:37:46] <Leodash_> Oooh, Ong Bak knee attack
[6:37:46] <bryllun> SEGA needs to be KOF
[6:37:47] <Mark_of_the_Wolves> Everytime the flash kick hits my brain freezes.
[6:37:48] <%rev_engineer> Ryo from shenmue for VF5?
[6:37:49] <%Kalzassa> @Adwark Mmmhmm they all suck in one form or another, but clearly people didn't like the one they used particularly even though SFV is exactly the same, just isn't as much of it.
[6:37:49] <%onilao> i love playing his sis
[6:37:55] <%Sulfur_Boride> But Bayo would use guns, no?
[6:37:55] <GreenShinobi26> looks like he's frame trapping with it
[6:37:58] <Zephyrus0> see tekken players? This is a 3D fighter with good movement looks like. And with good mechanics
[6:37:58] <%AnderMakk> are these live matches?
[6:38:00] <maohayato> @Wiiplayah43 then enlighten me, whats the difference?
[6:38:01] <%j_feezyy> Bring back spikeout.
[6:38:01] <sanka945> gunstar Heroes characters pog lacH
[6:38:02] <%Tetsuya5963> It's a very Sega-like bass sound doodOK
[6:38:03] <Yar_Holmes> Bring back Sega does what Nintendont SeemsGood
[6:38:08] <+aroo27> but Bayonetta with no projectiles? hmm
[6:38:08] <%Zephyrbal> @Maximilian_DOOD Omega dream scenario. Sega buys SNK Playmore
[6:38:15] <%sae_what> Ohhh
[6:38:17] <%onilao> nice!
[6:38:18] <%LinkSOB> They should call in Chun-Li and Ryu Services Inc. to intervene on their DLC issues.
[6:38:35] <WizardOfLight1> Why would you want sega to buy snk lmao
[6:38:36] <@cawi> I think I was doing buktooth Doom combo in MvC3 when it was new.
[6:38:37] <Adanion> thats such dangerous damage on wakeup
[6:38:40] <tamerlanethegreat> @wellbornwarrior As much as VF deserves more hype, giving Marvel even more exposure is a nauseating thought.
[6:38:44] <%sae_what> Ryu and chun in every game Lets do it LUL
[6:38:44] <Harv88> Crash Bandicoot in this game  LUL
[6:38:46] <%ninja_mutation> ninja_mutation subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months!

[6:38:48] <DaKnightWarrior> cool.
[6:38:48] <+Applicationking> Or get irl guest characters, get hulk hogan
[6:39:06] <Disorder_unit> helped write the Prime Guide for MvC3
[6:39:09] <shikimagura> @zephyrbal  Playmore doesn't exist anymore. It's back to SNK.
[6:39:14] <%YinYangRaiden> buktooth PogChamp PogChamp
[6:39:16] <damosuzukii> looks like the pontiff sulvayn boss arena
[6:39:19] <%Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> wwe is already doing things with Snk
[6:39:19] <+Nocturne_Noble> When you're ready... you'll be able to see through them.
[6:39:20] <bryllun> I rather SEGA not buy KOF. @zephyrbal
[6:39:21] <andviceversa_> Jackie is cool
[6:39:22] <%Kalzassa> sprixeSipsip
[6:39:23] <+ShadowScorpion> I love how so many of these matches start with a player dominating then suddenly the other player starts adapting
[6:39:23] <Zcanzer> ryu and chun li are everywhere now
[6:39:27] <+aroo27> we're one Direct away from Crash in Smash Kreygasm
[6:39:28] <+revdanny> I remember watching old Buktooth  videos and Hibiki Morgan kyo team on CVS2
[6:39:28] <DJ_is_Raiden> don't ruin virtua fighter turning it into megamix
[6:39:28] <%AnderMakk> add vergil
[6:39:29] <JDtG_Twitch> @sae_what Ryu and Chun just become the ambassadors for fighting games
[6:39:29] <TruzenHilpom> I hate badguys characters
[6:39:30] <+otetas> why isnt max playing?

[6:39:32] <%Qblackman34> ryo in vf
[6:39:32] <%CyberneticHype> @Maximilian_DOOD Just joined, how's your online experience been so far?
[6:39:34] <afrodraws77> what about ryu and chun li
[6:39:34] <%Adwark> @Kalzassa Yeah, that kinda makes me feel it's more not about DLC model itself but actually the game itself. Like game gotta attract people to buy it and keep playing.
[6:39:38] <PleasingAroma> 🎲 🔑
[6:39:41] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Alright, what's going on?
[6:39:42] <RorBoy> where are the Laus? FeelsBadMan

[6:40:20] <%Tricky_vfdc> @ThisisEubanks GGs earlier btw
[6:40:21] <%MrMidLife> is what it is...
[6:40:23] <Wiiplayah43> @tamerlanethegreat it would be worth it, VF needs all the exposure it can get
[6:40:24] <%CyberneticHype> About what I was expecting, thanks
[6:40:25] <%ninja_mutation> @maximilian_dood how are you liking the game overall?
[6:40:26] <%fancyfantasy> you playing again tomorrow max?

[6:40:29] <%thewb32018> Go Max!

[6:40:32] <Yar_Holmes> Fuck it, get a Star Wars character LUL LUL
[6:40:33] <bryllun> Wait, why Tokyo Revengers? @gear_ix
[6:40:35] <%Adwark> @chaosgodkhornes Cross-media guest appearances are real pain in the ass to handle of what I see.
[6:40:35] <%TheOGB> @ThisisEubanks we saw a match from you earlier
[6:40:36] <%VZLABoi> @otetas he is tired, also wanted to show higher level matches, so people see the difference.
[6:40:46] <+Rikka66> @chaosgodkhornes c'mon man, don't ask questions you know the answers toq
[6:40:46] <%xenocraigmorph> I'd love a Megamix stream some day
[6:40:52] <x_art_of_life_x> low punches NotLikeThis
[6:40:59] <+ThisisEubanks> @Tricky_vfdc ggs bro, you aint have to do me like that lmao
[6:40:59] <+Applicationking> @tamerlanethegreat Absolutely, but kinda still the face of wrrestling right? Could get John Cena or the Rock I guess
[6:41:03] <%quique_schz> im one of those!
[6:41:03] <%skynja> my first fighting games were soul calibur and VF as a kid, so this is super usual to me
[6:41:07] <%Mattman162> Tekken 3 was  my first fg
[6:41:08] <Fiko93> vf and tekken are lookalike but are soo different
[6:41:09] <tamerlanethegreat> @chaosgodkhornes True, Image comics definitely needs more attention. I would love to see Spawn featured more often.

[6:41:14] <%NaSh_kRaP> true Max
[6:41:16] <%VZLABoi> @xenocraigmorph  he did a legacy already last weekend
[6:41:16] <+Loliteku> I got into fighting games with MKX so this truly is completely foreign to me
[6:41:17] <%Kitsune826> was sf4 that big in bringing in new people into fighting games? @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:41:17] <Harv88> I loved playing VIrtua Fighter's as a kid during the arcade days
[6:41:18] <partyponypalooza> I was 1 of those SF4 players
[6:41:19] <%sae_what> That is one drunk old man doodDrool
[6:41:21] <@Nightbot> Check out our latest merch! Shirts, posters, mugs and more - https://maxdood.tv/merch
[6:41:29] <%thewb32018> exactly
[6:41:32] <Meranglemtur> im back from 2 hours of ranked. im loving it @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:41:34] <SirCold_> Tekken5 was the first one I was super into
[6:41:36] <Zcanzer> final round , final showdown
[6:41:39] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Kalzassa Got them, thanks.
[6:41:40] <%skynja> I feel like soul calibur is actually closer to VF than tekken
[6:41:41] <%Kitsune826> ah ok
[6:41:45] <KazuyaYakuza> the first fighting game I bought was Alpha 2 on SNES LUL
[6:41:46] <%LocalAlienParty> arcade was 2005 i think
[6:41:47] <%thewb32018> Street Fighter 4 is still great IMO
[6:41:47] <RorBoy> more specifically it was Super street fighter 4
[6:41:48] <%Tricky_vfdc> @ThisisEubanks lol i had to get those rank points bro
[6:41:50] <Devaseus> Getting martial artists like Tony Ja a or Donnie Yen to mocap themselves into Virtua Fighter would be pretty sick @Maximilian_DOOD
[6:41:55] <%sae_what> I think SF4 being multiplatform really helped sell it too
[6:41:58] <%Kalzassa> @Adwark If they do some stuff they'll just be copying VF or Tekken more though instead of doing their own thing. My main suggestion would be to embrace/make it tag only and expand it since the others don't/very rarely do that.
[6:41:58] <+Rikka66> @kitsune826 absolutely
[6:42:00] <%xenocraigmorph> I dropped off fighting games when SF4 came out. Biggest mistake of my gaming life
[6:42:00] <+ThisisEubanks> @TheOGB hope i wasn't trash lol
[6:42:00] <JDtG_Twitch> MvC3 on ps4 was my first, I’m fairly new here
[6:42:01] <%Kitsune826> that hair
[6:42:01] <%thewb32018> LUL

[6:42:05] <+Chili_Daddy> yung harada
[6:42:06] <+neonxaos> I forgot Brad existed.
[6:42:06] <%shujiatacha> Kiryu san? XD
[6:42:07] <primaryfire> is this ai?
[6:42:08] <%MrMidLife> If SF4 was your first FG, this is like something they got from the crash at Roswell. thefgtXiang
[6:42:10] <tamerlanethegreat> @Applicationking I'd add the Undertaker to that list.
[6:42:15] <+Nocturne_Noble> You can still see the ghost of VF in DOA if you know where to look.
[6:42:16] <%Kalzassa> @Viewtifulotaku7 happythoThumbsUp
[6:42:19] <+天使42199> @dnice3838 with rollback probably longer, but it might have a decent life span since SF and tekken will take their sweet ass time with sequels
[6:42:19] <%Brunty023> I haven't seen this Brad player yet
[6:42:21] <Harv88> ps3 and early ps4 era of fighting games were just really bad visually as game devs were still trying to figure out 3D
[6:42:25] <@Nightbot> Check out NZXT’s newest Starter PC series! An excellent first gaming PC--perfect for school work and working from home while maintaining great gaming performance. Built and shipped within 48 hours with a 2-year warranty. http://nzxt.co/SPC_MaxChat
[6:42:26] <RaKazuto> yung harada all hail to yung harada
[6:42:28] <WeirdLab> is the sumo character low tier ? still havent seen it
[6:42:28] <%Yofu_Kashi> When VF5 came out I was a teenager that preferred DoA for.....reasons
[6:42:48] <%MisterAJ1993> Holy Shit!
[6:42:49] <%sonicxwin> sonicxwin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Virtua Fighter was game me and my brothers discover by an accident and now its one of our top ten fighting games and shine on Max!!!!
[6:42:50] <andviceversa_> lol is that ignis
[6:42:51] <%Sulfur_Boride> @WeirdLab He's actually top tier, funny enough
[6:42:55] <+otetas> how come this old game has such good animations yet mk is still struggling nowadays...
[6:42:56] <@Viewtifulotaku7> @Yofu_Kashi Either works because DoA is the closest to VF in terms of 3D fighting games.
[6:42:56] <+Owltosser> that is the 1 frame damn
[6:42:56] <%Blurrygil> VF2 REALLY got me into the VF series, though I did play a ton of VF1 doodMash
[6:43:03] <%Tristar49> Bruce
[6:43:06] <DNICE3838> will see
[6:43:08] <%MightySandwich> Can you enable the frame data display for replays, like in Final Showdown @Maximilian_DOOD ?
[6:43:10] <+Arngrinn> @Maximilian_DOOD they should give us the character from comix zone
[6:43:10] <SirCold_> I think I had VF on one of those old PS2 demo discs
[6:43:14] <@Viewtifulotaku7> Most if not all DoA players are also VF players.
[6:43:15] <%sae_what> That backdash tho
[6:43:18] <primaryfire> oh wow he combos after that throw
[6:43:19] <%Kitsune826> sf4 was big but i never knew how influential it was in bringing in new blood. being multiplatform was a great thing
[6:43:22] <@Nightbot> Watch our YoVideogames stream archives on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/yovideogames
[6:43:23] <%onilao> tough to learn but my god he hits hard
[6:43:23] <Leodash_> How about putting VF character cameo in upcoming Yakuza games?
[6:43:24] <+Rikka66> @mrmidlife it's only 3 years between them.  maybe savecthst comparison for vf1
[6:43:31] <DaKnightWarrior> Akira is so much fun.
[6:43:36] <%YinYangRaiden> so fast
[6:43:38] <+MrNightmare0477> lets add tj combo to this game idk lol
[6:43:39] <%MisterAJ1993> You think Akira is more to watch then play?
[6:43:43] <%skynja> @weirdlab people just don't want to play him cause Sumo wrestlers aren't super popular in most of the world
[6:43:51] <zenith0111> I love that
[6:43:52] <%MisterAJ1993> *more fun*
[6:43:54] <andviceversa_> Bajiquan is cooool
[6:43:56] <BonehouseV> how many retro stages are there? ive just seen one
[6:44:01] <%onilao> right max and so many people play different characters!
[6:44:01] <%CyberneticHype> Makes fighting games great
[6:44:02] <JUJUxANONY> looking at you SFV
[6:44:04] <+solidpeyo> is nice to see them not bottom smashing
[6:44:05] <chaosgodkhornes> The reason I play DoA because of Ryu Hayabusa Kappa
[6:44:07] <%xenocraigmorph> Everyone has got these power bulbs on
[6:44:11] <%Frizen_101> @otetas NRS doesn't hire actual martial artists for their mocap. Thats the only thing i can think of
[6:44:12] <misternegative2010> Yeah it won't happen in strive based on how restrictive it is
[6:44:13] <JDtG_Twitch> @bonehousev just the one sadly
[6:44:15] <+Nocturne_Noble> It's beautiful that a system exist that facilitates that expression.
[6:44:17] <DNICE3838> yeah its awesome
