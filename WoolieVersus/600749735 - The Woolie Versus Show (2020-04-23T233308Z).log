[0:09:12] <%jiggy_snipe> hypest intro ever
[0:09:18] <C4m3r0n0409> Sick intro
[0:09:24] <+itsOnyxLeo> @C4m3r0n0409 Matt's channel seems to be doing super well. He really blossoms in scripted content and his series Wha Happun is really fun. Liam's channel doesn't seem to be doing as well, but he seems content with it being a tiny channel for a tiny community after dealing with the stress of being the least liked best friend for so long. I'm glad both are doing well!
[0:09:24] <StarkMaximum> I love this intro because it really just shows how much Woolie fucking loves fighting games
[0:09:29] <extradopeness> Let’s go!!!

[0:20:28] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Will you do Soul calbibur 6 when Samurai Shodown char is out?
[0:20:34] <StarkMaximum> (psst: anyone who missed out on Melty Blood, don't forget there's a free non-Steam version that I hear is arguably better)
[0:20:38] <+ikasukiz> melty deserves more respect than that shit
[0:20:40] <Hessman212> i found that melty blood barely works on steam
[0:20:40] <%Reverend_Roscoe> The speed of light is too slow for us

[0:26:25] <%TimetodiveLTX> but how fast is the startup
[0:26:25] <%Irridium> Djeeta is fuckin' nuts yeah
[0:26:28] <mercado94> the biggest whale that ever existed
[0:26:32] <BlackermanZX> she has cancels iirc
[0:26:33] <BackwardCap> SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR FRIENDS!
[0:26:33] <Nekros4442> Reminder that Djeeta has hit the endgame of Granblue that takes over a year and Gran is the basic bitch at the start
[0:26:36] <%TimetodiveLTX> of his and her moves
[0:26:41] <%Rhinoprotoss> Punch is negative on block tho
[0:26:41] <%Solidnick18> reminds me of azreal
[0:26:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> She's not really a whale, she's a late game player
[0:26:44] <jase__x> FOR SALT
[0:26:53] <StarkMaximum> Let's be real, Djeeta isn't a whale. The Eternal shit is PURE grinding. You can't buy that. Djeeta put in the time to get where she is.
[0:26:53] <CookieDoughFK> Lots of Chip
[0:26:55] <neet98> she is not femc because she is clear better than Gran
[0:26:59] <KingSpunf> Digging these Bayou Guitars
[0:26:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hope you're ready to grind out djeeta's super because boy them buttons
[0:27:09] <StarkMaximum> hey guys, time limit
[0:27:13] <+ikasukiz> the rapid punch has followups in fundoshi install only
[0:27:14] <Profmcsteevie> GEYSER!
[0:27:14] <awildgooseappears> hes basically azreal
[0:27:20] <%andrei11dr> So burn knuckle
[0:27:22] <+Grayhammatter> power GEYSER
[0:27:25] <+TyeTheCzar> Djeeta's great because Yuri harem shipping
[0:27:26] <%Irridium> you can get her super rythem down not too bad. real satisfying
[0:27:27] <Enderou> she's not femc cause she don't got no TIMBS
[0:27:30] <StarkMaximum> ORAORAORAORA
[0:27:30] <%Rhinoprotoss> But whhy don't open move list?
[0:27:31] <neet98> also uee the japanese voice for Jesus

[0:27:33] <+ghostfaceninja_> ORA ORAORAORAORA
[0:27:36] <Allrthur> oraoraora
[0:27:41] <mercado94> @tyetheczar excellent taste
[0:27:42] <%thunderhog> EX also doesnt have pushback on block, so if they block ex punch, you get placed in range for literally anything
[0:27:43] <%ChoculaUltra> Djeeta is the person who joins the raid, one shots the boss with her Scales grid, walks away with mvp slot. Gets all the drops she needs.
[0:27:44] <%Solidnick18> yeah that's azreal
[0:27:44] <Milo_Oda> theyre in english DansGame
[0:27:48] <neet98> this eng dub is tripping me

[0:27:53] <@Solidus_113> dub is fine
[0:27:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> ion really play gb I just wait for the free rolls and look at the character pngs and dip so idk what chat's talking about rn
[0:27:54] <faqmachine> it also buffs his defense so he takes less damage
[0:27:55] <C4m3r0n0409> WHY DOES PLAYER 1 WIN
[0:27:55] <Milo_Oda> but soriz his takamura in japanese
[0:28:01] <%Conzanagi> His DP ain't invincible though
[0:28:09] <theangryguyofde> Soriz Cr.L, Close L, M Power Geezer, H Power Geezer, and H Fury blows are Plus. Everything else, not so much NotLikeThis

[0:28:47] <CookieDoughFK> Its great for getting space
[0:28:47] <%deviljhojho_> Soriz is actually the most heavily armed character in the game, if you think about it
[0:28:48] <%Zerotoad5> Check soriz chip damage btw
[0:28:48] <KingSpunf> Check out Deez Nutz

[0:30:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> djeeta confirmed NOT a bad bitch from the bronx NotLikeThis
[0:30:21] <jase__x> Reggie got that tech
[0:30:21] <Nekros4442> oh right Djeeta can cancel into charge and out
[0:30:23] <+TyeTheCzar> Thighhighs are fekkin everywhere in GBF. It's like a requiremetn for most women and it's shit
[0:30:29] <neet98> fck the timbs, she have all the whale grid
[0:30:33] <rideroftraps1> Rosetta in the back
[0:30:35] <+BaikenAndEggs> @Wool who wouldn't
[0:30:41] <Nekros4442> She gets a groundbounce at later levels
[0:30:42] <faqmachine> It gives it invincibility at full charge iirc
[0:30:47] <%SirGO0SE> oh got i dont want to buy this on ps4 right now but iw ant to play reg so bad
[0:30:48] <theangryguyofde> Reggie knows things, Dokapon Kingdom spending three weeks trying to get into a shop is forgiven LUL
[0:30:54] <neet98> look pass the timbs
[0:31:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> chat will Woolie be P'd on today?
[0:31:03] <+ghostfaceninja_> wait what's wrong with thighhighs ?
[0:31:14] <neet98> nothing
[0:31:17] <Monstercar329> Deadly Rave
[0:31:17] <Triplicat> LLMMHHLMH214U
[0:31:20] <%andrei11dr> So it's like the level charges with Order Sol
[0:31:20] <0cash> djeeta is so strong
[0:31:31] <%SirGO0SE> its hard
[0:31:39] <theangryguyofde> it's okay Reggie, you can mash the inputs
[0:31:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Das a combo
[0:31:58] <Monstercar329> She goes Eternal Edge mode, too. (SSGSS)
[0:32:00] <%ChoculaUltra> damn that all 12 eternal skybound art is so sick.
[0:32:02] <Sir_Dolphinian> you cant mas any more
[0:32:06] <Sir_Dolphinian> they fixed
[0:32:20] <Sir_Dolphinian> mash*
[0:32:21] <Triplicat> you can absolutely still mash it out
[0:32:24] <+BaikenAndEggs> It's not that hard, but the timing is harder than Deadly Rave.
[0:32:27] <%thunderhog> You can also technically do the full deadly rave on block if you're insane
[0:32:35] <neet98> all those weapon cost u some massive cash in the mobile game btw
[0:32:37] <Triplicat> the thing they fixed was being able to mash L+M+H all at the same time for the whole move
[0:32:45] <Triplicat> which was also funny in its own right
[0:33:15] <%ChoculaUltra> um no? Those are Eternal weapons, you can only grind them out in the monthly Unite & Fight event.
[0:33:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:33:26] <%thunderhog> You can not eat supers
[0:33:32] <+BaikenAndEggs> You could do that? Wow.Glad they patched it.
[0:33:33] <theangryguyofde> Woolie with no reversal is going to be free LUL
[0:33:37] <+xir0gravity> soriz can't muscle supers
[0:33:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah, you gotta grind for those weapons
[0:33:46] <Monstercar329> @neet98 They don't cost money, just time to grind 40 boxes.
[0:33:46] <neet98> it is really funny that Djeeta is just the embodiment of granblue whale
[0:33:55] <%andrei11dr> Imagine if they made you pay for the moves ,to keep that gatcha spirit LUL
[0:33:57] <%Rhinoprotoss> Even if Soriz could muscle supers he'd lose a shit ton of life
[0:34:05] <Enderou> are we sure this is for fun? seems pretty for glory to me
[0:34:20] <theangryguyofde> When you resonate with Djeeta on a deep level TPFufun
[0:34:37] <%andrei11dr> I don't know why they didn't just go to training mode
[0:34:44] <%Janders156> Janders156 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:34:45] <Enderou> same
[0:34:47] <SunsetJack> Second super is free when you activate install.
[0:34:49] <neet98> she also only have waifu in her crew, no man here
[0:34:50] <+BaikenAndEggs> I hope they buff fundoshi fist. It's damage is way too low.
[0:34:54] <+ghostfaceninja_> Reggie knows his shit but he's yet to make it out of pools
[0:34:55] <+tearknack> i just think djeeta is cute and gran is lame
[0:34:57] <+xir0gravity> all that whaling and still not as good as gran sounds about right
[0:34:59] <+tearknack> djeeta isn
[0:35:08] <%thunderhog> Damn, DOWNPLAY THE REG

[0:36:03] <Monstercar329> Did @woolieversus say if there will be a RPG mode playthrough? The reactions to the raid boss fights would be fun.
[0:36:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tearknack to be fair the starting class doesn't really have that much of a design, the later classes look pretty cool
[0:36:09] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:36:12] <phatmac16> you can find out by downloading the mobile game

[0:37:15] <+DrDenorax> Oh you have to buy it?
[0:37:16] <%NecDW4> Katalina BEST GIRL! Let's hope Apollo gets in for Wollie's sake.
[0:37:17] <+DrDenorax> Augh.
[0:37:27] <CookieDoughFK> You can dodge after to bait the response
[0:37:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Now this is Gachibass
[0:37:31] <theangryguyofde> it's plus on block, but sucks tbh
[0:37:33] <neet98> dont let it set in
[0:37:36] <BackwardCap> Its a guard crush though
[0:37:41] <+tearknack> @NecDW4 is apollo a punchgirl
[0:37:41] <%nothuzad> DrDenorax if you have the season pass you are covered for that too
[0:37:53] <SilverSnake55> He playing on pc or ps4
[0:37:55] <+GardeninTool> 15% base + 5% per stack. maxes at 35%
[0:37:59] <%Irridium> PS4

[0:38:02] <%nothuzad> tearknack I mean she was mostly using a sword wasnt she?
[0:38:02] <%NecDW4> @tearknack Have you seen teh animu?
[0:38:04] <%andrei11dr> Check Out Deez Nuts!
[0:38:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I would have a feeling woolie would play Nicholas/Shiro in a heartbeat if he was in
[0:38:10] <SilverSnake55> Oh man what a shame
[0:38:11] <Monstercar329> @tearknack She's Black Knight.
[0:38:13] <neet98> Soriz is not very good right?
[0:38:26] <theangryguyofde> you can only combo from flex on CH Crouch
[0:38:27] <+DrDenorax> oh, cool. Thanks @nothuzad .
[0:38:35] <+xir0gravity> Nahh he's actually good
[0:38:40] <%Irridium> Soriz can do things but you need to do more than you'd have to with other characters
[0:38:42] <+xir0gravity> Soriz shits out damage
[0:38:45] <CookieDoughFK> Its worth
[0:38:45] <+GardeninTool> its not
[0:38:47] <+tearknack> @NecDW4 no, i know nothing about granblue except GBVS
[0:38:59] <CookieDoughFK> Its worth for the space you get
[0:39:03] <Monstercar329> Def buff, not damage buff.
[0:39:13] <neet98> i wish black knight is in the next dlc wave
[0:39:13] <%deviljhojho_> MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
[0:39:18] <Triplicat> now kill with it
[0:39:18] <phatmac16> yeyeyeyeyey
[0:39:20] <Sir_Dolphinian> wait.. i thought you didnt get the stage with the pass.. did they update it??
[0:39:20] <%NecDW4> @tearknack She's an incredibly powerful BIG HYOOJ knight chick with short hair
[0:39:22] <%thunderhog> For some quick math, 5 stacks reduced damage by 40 percent. the problem is that what would normally be a 60k combo is still around 30k, which is the same damage you need to be to do the ssba
[0:39:23] <DeathByPoke7> can you do a move install and still combo after
[0:39:24] <ambadev> SOIYA SOIYA SOIYA
[0:39:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> And a special victory screen!
[0:39:26] <SunsetJack> You can only do it once per round.
[0:39:28] <neet98> black knight is very cool
[0:39:34] <%Wool> it's training mode
[0:39:37] <%Irridium> @Sir_Dolphinian you gotta buy it
[0:39:42] <%andrei11dr> That's some Ashura Wrath shit
[0:39:45] <+BaikenAndEggs> Damage is so bad...
[0:39:56] <%NecDW4> I know nothing about SnS girl coming out soon, but i'm big excite for her just becuz SnS.
[0:39:58] <+xir0gravity> go into options and turn off the hp heal
[0:40:00] <%nothuzad> I think apart from horny guy (belial) being in s2 sandalphon is semi-confirmed for secon character I think
[0:40:00] <+DrDenorax> Its going down, the healing in training mode is healing it back quickly.
[0:40:00] <@Solidus_113> armour?
[0:40:02] <%thunderhog> Because you dont take Red damage
[0:40:03] <+GardeninTool> Because hes not in a flinch state
[0:40:07] <+ghostfaceninja_> yundastand
[0:40:08] <%skylerpilot> Because you not in hit tun

[0:40:36] <neet98> sandolphone is when all the female player join this game
[0:40:38] <%Wool> people say the armor is bad, not him
[0:40:38] <+draveto> as a Metera Soriz scares me
[0:40:39] <Monstercar329> Growler reduces damage, but he still took damage.
[0:40:41] <theangryguyofde> Now spot dodge the flex to punish NotLikeThis
[0:40:42] <CookieDoughFK> Naramaya & Belzebub
[0:40:43] <+Kaendorth> you can also cancel a ch close h into install and combo after

[0:40:47] <Perfect_Jehuty> Soriz is dash punch: the character
[0:40:49] <oceanmatt> vaseraga is def better than soriz
[0:40:53] <+GardeninTool> bottom 3 for sure

[0:41:08] <theangryguyofde> no Fame is Winning. Vasarega is just there
[0:41:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he just has to work for it

[0:42:46] <Zayasu> by what cirLewd
[0:42:49] <%Irridium> Dub's fine
[0:42:49] <BackwardCap> Soriz is voiced by Iron Tager in english.
[0:42:52] <neet98> but the jp version is so much better
[0:42:54] <%nothuzad> its english lu bu and pap nier - yes
[0:42:56] <+talentedcrayon> That’s papa nier’s voice actor. And the division commander from MHW. Love that guy

[0:43:08] <%thunderhog> Also for those not in the know i guess, Soritz has different lines for guys and girls
[0:43:10] <theangryguyofde> Standing L is minus WutFace
[0:43:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> He was basically a world class martial artist, but he loved the ladies too much, until his master told him, either girls or fists. He chose fists and got worse. So he dedicates his fights to the ladies
[0:43:12] <YakumoYomi> @Monstercar329 And for the love of God...DON'T PURSUE HIM
[0:43:13] <%Wool> Woolie did EX punch lmao
[0:43:16] <Perfect_Jehuty> His whole gameplan revolves around his dash punch
[0:43:16] <+BaikenAndEggs> People have proved that tiers dont mean hit in this game.
[0:43:23] <%Wool> Woolie stop doing EX punch
[0:43:24] <+ghostfaceninja_> @nothuzad I'm just saying, being a tier whore is for the pros, if you're playing casually, play what you want
[0:43:26] <shadowbringersletsgo> English Percival is best voice actor both english and japanese, dont @ me

[0:44:27] <+tearknack> that laugh is great
[0:44:27] <0cash> Only voice better in the dub is the dumb dragon
[0:44:27] <+ghostfaceninja_> @nothuzad they're the true heroes
[0:44:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> You gotta dragon and you gotta dragon

[0:44:36] <CookieDoughFK> Chad Djeeta
[0:44:37] <neet98> pony up the cash for better dragon
[0:44:38] <%Conzanagi> The games simple enough that everyone has a decent enough fighting chance but some characters do have a lot of advantages over others.

[0:46:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YOOOOOOO
[0:46:06] <+TyeTheCzar> Is Djeeta actually Misty?
[0:46:08] <%nothuzad> andrei11dr all the major races are humans with some differences
[0:46:08] <Monstercar329> @tearknack Zooey's the Grand Order, a primal who protects the balance. She has dragons, called Lyrn and Dyrn. She also has Gundam references.
[0:46:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> big duhmage
[0:46:12] <%MisterArcanine> Did she pull out a gun???
[0:46:13] <gordieda20> Ded
[0:46:14] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @phatmac16
[0:46:20] <+tearknack> @Monstercar329 sold
[0:46:24] <concretenj> There's throw invincibility on wakeup in this game iirc
[0:46:25] <Nekros4442> @MisterArcanine Djeeta has every weapon in her rave. So yes
[0:46:29] <neet98> yes she have a gun
[0:46:30] <%ChoculaUltra> a lot of the cast are actually Archangels with on causal level powers/abilities. A bunch of Draph and Erune thotties too.
[0:46:32] <%SirGO0SE> your grabs have to kiss in this game
[0:46:32] <shadowbringersletsgo> Djeeta in Japanese = that squid girl loli that says gesho
[0:46:34] <%thunderhog> @MisterArcanine Yep that was a gun. She literally uses the best weapon of each type all in one move
[0:46:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> She believes in Djeeta
[0:46:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @andrei11dr there are different races - rehular humans, lalafels, people with horns, animal eared people and primals, which are basically demi gods
[0:46:38] <+ghostfaceninja_> aren't there like, hundreds of characters in GranBlu? there's gotta be some anthros in there
[0:46:51] <+xir0gravity> exactly 1
[0:46:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Not really
[0:47:00] <neet98> this is bullying
[0:47:01] <Triplicat> woolie is too smart to play soriz the way reggie is telling him soriz is played.
[0:47:01] <%Irridium> reggie doing the coward version of the super
[0:47:03] <%Conzanagi> The first hit is a guard break so Soriz's SSBA is unblockable but it has pretty low damage compared to other supers
[0:47:03] <skewerstar> Her Deadly Rave is basically Armiger!
[0:47:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @xir0gravity Who?
[0:47:10] <rcgama> i think theres grab invul on wake up in this game
[0:47:10] <%ChoculaUltra> goddamn that is so sick

[0:47:16] <powerprotoman> reggie hitting 5A
[0:47:18] <+tearknack> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ lalafels are just pointy hobbits, weeb
[0:47:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:47:23] <theangryguyofde> It's called Power Geezer, jeez
[0:47:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I don't have Wulf and Renie
[0:47:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Power of gun>>>>>>>>>>all
[0:47:29] <rideroftraps1> Yes there is a anthro called wulf
[0:47:29] <%MisterArcanine> Old dusty rave
[0:47:36] <%ChoculaUltra> aren't they called Harvin in GBF?
[0:47:40] <+BaikenAndEggs> No anthros. Kemonomimi at best like Lowain.
[0:47:43] <shadowbringersletsgo> ya theres like 6 frames grab invuln on wake up (someone correct me if wrong)
[0:47:52] <%ChoculaUltra> also - SSR Lowain friggin when?! WHEN?
[0:47:55] <rideroftraps1> He is a werewolf
[0:47:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> But there are Vampires, Dragon People, Puppet golems, actual dragons, etc
[0:47:58] <Triplicat> gottem
[0:48:02] <+ikasukiz> no tails on the kemono race, trash
[0:48:04] <%Conzanagi> EX Rush Punch can combo into EX Kick in believe
[0:48:06] <Triplicat> TETSUZANKO
[0:48:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tearknack no, they are potato hobbits, obviously BIg difference
[0:48:16] <+ikasukiz> that's half the trope
[0:48:17] <theangryguyofde> Also Grandblue: This Loli is an old man on the inside TPFufun
[0:48:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @ikasukiz Look at Yuel and Societte
[0:48:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Giant Lady
[0:48:29] <%SirGO0SE> #PITCREW where you at?!
[0:48:29] <+tearknack> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ i've always thought they look more like onions than potatoes
[0:48:34] <skewerstar> ROSETTA!! <3
[0:48:37] <+ikasukiz> @alteisenreisez ok
[0:48:40] <shadowbringersletsgo> boi no one likes lowain, theres a reason he doesnt have an SSR
[0:48:42] <+xir0gravity> Geyser is the corner combo starter'
[0:48:46] <BackwardCap> Thats why you spam rush punch
[0:48:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> they got enough tail for everybody
[0:48:48] <+ghostfaceninja_> yo Cygames needs to get on that furry train, they're ignoring free money
[0:48:49] <shadowbringersletsgo> whys he even in dis game pls delete
[0:48:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tearknack how about we settle on cabbages?
[0:48:56] <%andrei11dr> So wat chat is telling me is there's no unconventional monster thing that could be in this game, but i guess this not that tipe of fantasy design
[0:48:56] <+TyeTheCzar> GBF basically every light novel fantasy cliche in one universe. The characters themselves are fun tho
[0:49:03] <+tearknack> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ cabbages work
[0:49:10] <%ChoculaUltra> Eustace would be p sick to see in GBVS. He's basically Erune Solid Snake.
[0:49:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tearknack there ya go
[0:49:16] <shadowbringersletsgo> we have penguins and bells as robots
[0:49:18] <%Irridium> there it is

[0:50:08] <Shardlab> That creeper smile, man.
[0:50:08] <fluke_LKZ> In the Robomi storyline has a literal Kamen Rider
[0:50:08] <%Wool> SORIZ IS NO GENTLEMAN
[0:50:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> there should be no quote
[0:50:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> JUST NOW
[0:50:16] <%arkv01> soriz is going to TAKE HIS SPOILS
[0:50:17] <+BaikenAndEggs> He also nekad
[0:50:21] <gordieda20> LUL LUL
[0:50:21] <+ghostfaceninja_> shhhhh that's for the doujins
[0:50:23] <+tearknack> i thought soriz was a gross Roshi type
[0:50:24] <%andrei11dr> I love the costume win screens this game has
[0:50:24] <+itsOnyxLeo> BibleThump BibleThump
[0:50:26] <neet98> soriz is a geezer though
[0:50:33] <Triplicat> shirou is top 5 dudes that should be in GBVS
[0:50:34] <%arkv01> soriz is canon horny
[0:50:39] <theangryguyofde> the fact that fundoshi install doesn't have lyrics is a crime
[0:50:39] <Triplicat> imagine.
[0:50:39] <neet98> he is not really a gentleman
[0:50:43] <%gatorafan> @ghostfaceninja_, implying Soriz gets that kind of doujins.
[0:50:53] <%thunderhog> He's a pervert but he respects women
[0:50:56] <%thunderhog> apparently
[0:51:00] <0cash> FGO crossover character when
[0:51:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> soriz is just general perv, but nothing too criminal
[0:51:13] <C4m3r0n0409> THESE GUNS ARENT FOR SHOW
[0:51:16] <SomersaultJustice> One TOUUUCCCCHHHH
[0:51:17] <phatmac16> BASED
[0:51:22] <%Conzanagi> I hope I'm as healthy as Soriz when I'm 70
[0:51:22] <+BaikenAndEggs> Fundoshi Install needs lyrics like Bang Install.
[0:51:23] <%Reverend_Roscoe> GET IT?
[0:51:23] <neet98> he is not the sodomy man
[0:51:27] <eldragon_1> He's like Sanji. Gentleman perv
[0:51:37] <+tearknack> okay sanji is fine
[0:51:37] <+ghostfaceninja_> @gatorafan Yaoi dojins are a thing
[0:51:44] <theangryguyofde> @0cash Kintoki getting the Arcsys look Kreygasm
[0:51:46] <%thunderhog> The worst we'll ever do is voyerism cause his arcade ending his him getting kicked out a hot spring for peping on all the girls
[0:51:48] <+tearknack> id heard him described as a Roshi, which is
[0:51:50] <+tearknack> ick
[0:51:53] <%MisterArcanine> I really wanted to learn Ladiva when she first came out but I just didn’t feel like I could get in with her
[0:52:02] <%gatorafan> of course, that's why U specified "that kind" of doujins
[0:52:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> And just like Sanji he is the first-mate of the ship is he not? Kappa
[0:52:08] <neet98> sodomy man is the actual worst
[0:52:10] <Triplicat> reggie out here playing street fighter
[0:52:11] <BoneBagMel> PUNISH
[0:52:19] <gordieda20> DEATH

[0:52:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> He's a pretty ok guy
[0:52:35] <skewerstar> Man... it would be so hype if the vocals were dynamically added in if Soriz's theme's already playing...
[0:52:39] <neet98> yes
[0:52:40] <like3000people> is that dragon from Neopets
[0:52:40] <Monstercar329> @tearknack Soriz is sorta Master Roshi, he lost a fight because he was a perv, but he fought his Shadows and developed his fighting style. Which is using his memories of women to hit harder.
[0:52:42] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ohhhh, He's the first character in the next pass
[0:52:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Belial
[0:52:47] <0cash> @theangryguyofde he'd fit right in too. I want Gilgamesh tho
[0:52:49] <+BaikenAndEggs> Oh god yes

[0:54:38] <%ChoculaUltra> Belial wants to fuck anything with a hole in it tbh.
[0:54:40] <+ghostfaceninja_> but the real question is.... is Ladiva a top or a bottom?
[0:54:41] <neet98> belial fuck everything even without the hole, he'll find a way
[0:54:41] <%Rhinoprotoss> Not enough dash punch
[0:54:45] <DrFaustMD> soriz is all about going in and staying in
[0:54:46] <%MisterArcanine> Belial would take the Lowain Bros snd Yggy all together
[0:54:50] <theangryguyofde> I wonder if Reggie knows that M into M rekka is a frame trap that's safe on block LUL
[0:54:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yodarha would be sick too
[0:54:51] <+tearknack> i dunno granblue at all
[0:54:53] <phatmac16> Ladiva is a power bottom
[0:54:53] <powerprotoman> @sonofthedeepsouth belial would try to fuck the tree shes sitting on
[0:55:01] <%Janders156> Feather would be dope
[0:55:17] <0cash> @phatmac16 AHAHAH
[0:55:19] <berasite> no epic finish
[0:55:20] <gordieda20> DEATH
[0:55:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Feather is just Rock Howard
[0:55:23] <%ChoculaUltra> Yodarha needs to be in the game.
[0:55:23] <phatmac16> Feather is just Rock Howard, lol
[0:55:23] <+ghostfaceninja_> @phatmac16 correct answer
[0:55:27] <%Janders156> ye
[0:55:28] <%Zerotoad5> Feather is probably impossible
[0:55:33] <spardanwarrior> Electric Rock Howard would be nice
[0:55:46] <%Janders156> yeah, cause they can't just give him Rock's moveset
[0:55:46] <phatmac16> Max would go crazy
[0:55:48] <fluke_LKZ> I want an Eternal next.
[0:55:50] <fluke_LKZ> Like Seoux
[0:55:53] <Triplicat> why not
[0:55:54] <Monstercar329> @tearknack What about a yandere?
[0:56:02] <Triplicat> they gave charlotte honda's moveset
[0:56:04] <%ChoculaUltra> Seox would be so sick!
[0:56:04] <%MisterArcanine> Have they announced alll the season 2 folks yet
[0:56:04] <%arkv01> seox's likely to make it in s3ish
[0:56:06] <+BaikenAndEggs> Fenrir would be nice
[0:56:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> A zodiac?
[0:56:08] <0pirus> k
[0:56:11] <+ghostfaceninja_> Pog
[0:56:12] <%Solidnick18> Nice
[0:56:13] <neet98> btw, Belial made big money for GBF and hes not even a summonable character,
[0:56:15] <+AngriestAngryArtist> hit confirms
[0:56:17] <%andrei11dr> And there's also the guy that looks like Kain for FF4 ,he would be cool
[0:56:18] <+tearknack> @Monstercar329 not really my thing but if they're big and strong then sure
[0:56:28] <phatmac16> We need Shirou in next
[0:56:36] <phatmac16> or Robomi
[0:56:37] <%ChoculaUltra> that Belial summon with the Home Screen music change tho? Chef's kiss.
[0:56:38] <%Rhinoprotoss> 2M isn't a low tho
[0:56:39] <+LordJimmyBones> lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA
[0:56:39] <Nekros4442> I'm pretty sure Vira will be in Season 2
[0:56:40] <%arkv01> siegfried? yeah he's guaranteed
[0:56:43] <%thunderhog> @neet98 Well, he's technically a Summon now
[0:56:46] <Nekros4442> Vira is way too popular to not get in
[0:56:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ayyyyy
[0:56:46] <+LordJimmyBones> IM WATCHING
[0:56:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DON'T CHOKE
[0:57:01] <+tearknack> wow i looked up this Feather dude, and yeah, that is 100$% jsut rock Howard
[0:57:01] <%thunderhog> Jimmy watching his son embrace the SOIYA
[0:57:02] <skewerstar> @alteisenreisez Aside from Belial? Vira, Silva, Black Knight, Either Lecia or Monika.
[0:57:02] <neet98> not a character though @thunderhog
[0:57:04] <powerprotoman> id want to see lady grey in this shes a woman weidlign an axe and has her dead family as a stand
[0:57:08] <berasite> Jebaited
[0:57:10] <%Janders156> I'm pretty excited to try Zooey
[0:57:13] <phatmac16> Vira is like Saber and has 7 different versions in GBF
[0:57:14] <%ChoculaUltra> p sure Vane and Siegfried are a shoe in eventually. They already have Lancey and Perc.
[0:57:31] <Triplicat> siegfried will be so sick
[0:57:32] <+tearknack> @powerprotoman that sounds rad. axes are cool
[0:57:33] <%arkv01> gun characters are probably low likelihood
[0:57:34] <almost6bars> Illsa, Aliza @skewerstar
[0:57:39] <+BaikenAndEggs> Vira and Sandalphon are in for sure. No question.
[0:57:39] <%nothuzad> well S2 is gonna lead with male characters
[0:57:41] <%Conzanagi> Vira, Ilsa, Siegfried, Sandalphon and Nice Abs Vyrn for season pass 2
[0:57:48] <%nothuzad> but yea Vira is probably garuanteed
[0:57:51] <Nekros4442> @arkv01 Well....we did already get a Bow character. I wouldnt put it as unlikely
[0:57:51] <neet98> sieg is best dragon knight dont @ me
[0:57:55] <Monstercar329> @misterarcanine Only Belial confirmed, but Vira, Cagliostro, Beatrix, and Sandalphon may be in S2.
[0:57:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> BULLY
[0:58:01] <phatmac16> ROSETTA
[0:58:06] <powerprotoman> Nice Abs Vyrn with an isntal super that lets him go into perfect frieza mode
[0:58:06] <%ChoculaUltra> Gachapin and Mukku as a duo character for S3. Believe it.
[0:58:09] <%andrei11dr> DAS A HUGE BITCH
[0:58:12] <neet98> VIRA PLS
[0:58:17] <theangryguyofde> Gun > Harp PogChamp

[0:59:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> use em
[0:59:20] <BackwardCap> Gran Blue Privledge is the perfect description for the top 4 characters.
[0:59:22] <%arkv01> BUBBA
[0:59:26] <%Irridium> Bubs is mean and scary
[0:59:31] <%andrei11dr> That ain't a huge mosquito demon

[0:59:41] <%thunderhog> Voiced by DIAVOLO in japanese
[0:59:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> Narmaya has huge tracks of lands
[0:59:46] <jase__x> Titbox
[0:59:46] <Monstercar329> @0cash With one wild card left. Could be Lucilius or Black Knight. I'd rather have Sturm, though.
[0:59:50] <rcgama> Is Bubs the only villain in the game?
[0:59:56] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[0:59:57] <+BaikenAndEggs> Ah yeah both my mains
[1:00:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> OH FUCK OFF VERGIL

[1:00:06] <%nothuzad> rcgama fightable atm? yes - belialcomes in with s2
[1:00:07] <spardanwarrior> Until S2 with Belial, yes
[1:00:09] <+fizzguy47> giant tiddies
[1:00:10] <%thunderhog> Currently rcgama. Belilal would be the second villain as of S2
[1:00:11] <%ChoculaUltra> oh god that animation of her sliding her hand up the hilt woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[1:00:14] <phatmac16> Belial is coming as a villian

[1:00:20] <Dr00_PhD> Brianna Knickerbocker
[1:00:20] <+xir0gravity> Kira is Lyria
[1:00:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> in japanese he's diavolo
[1:00:22] <Hippoleon> I think Kira Buckland is Lyria
[1:00:23] <%Irridium> no. Kira does that girl gran/Djeeta mamoru's
[1:00:25] <%andrei11dr> That lady is quite horny Kappa
[1:00:26] <%optimasmaximas> jiggle physics abound LUL

[1:00:28] <Fenlig> Big beefers!
[1:00:28] <%ECRead> No, Kira is Lyria
[1:00:32] <neet98> dlc add more villain
[1:00:41] <LionShard> Bubs sharing same VA as Diavolo is so good
[1:00:43] <%Solidnick18> oh woah
[1:00:50] <neet98> like sodomy man
[1:00:53] <%SirGO0SE> narmaya's light is just a tiddy slap
[1:01:02] <+tearknack> god this song is great
[1:01:08] <%RD_nx> woolieFUN ?
[1:01:09] <@Solidus_113> that's a DIO teleport
[1:01:10] <%MisterArcanine> Nothing personal kid
[1:01:12] <%ECRead> yes
[1:01:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> On the subject of Belial does he actually succeeds into fucking people or is he a meme?
[1:01:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:01:22] <+tearknack> @RD_nx for fun, but with research reggie
[1:01:22] <neet98> dio pose
[1:01:26] <%SirGO0SE> SUPER punishable
[1:01:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tearknack the original version has lyrics but this version is clean too
[1:01:37] <skewerstar> Oh wow, he even laughs like DIO!
[1:01:44] <neet98> belial fuck u mentally
[1:01:45] <%Conzanagi> 2B and 9S are Gran and Lyria
[1:01:46] <@Solidus_113> that fireball stops projectiles
[1:01:51] <%SirGO0SE> randommly dping as beezy is a great way to get a mouthfull of dp
[1:01:52] <+o0TheGoodLife0o> Still waiting on ArkSys JoJo game
[1:01:53] <%ChoculaUltra> I can see Gilbert being a villain character candidate if they did it right.
[1:01:54] <Monstercar329> @sonofthedeepsouth Yes, but actually no.
[1:01:54] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> Why not jp va?
[1:01:56] <%arkv01> all the grands are going to get in so probs sturm and drang
[1:02:07] <%thunderhog> Also different stances have different cooldowns
[1:02:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Jeanne is a shoe in
[1:02:18] <%Irridium> her fireball goes through projectiles, doesn't just stop them
[1:02:19] <%RD_nx> Bub has Diavolo's Japanese VO.
[1:02:20] <skewerstar> MIST FINER!
[1:02:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Titbox lets go
[1:02:27] <%Conzanagi> She also has a hitbox on her boobs
[1:02:29] <neet98> all the sexual stuff with belial is implied, because game for all ages
[1:02:34] <+LTKonnor> ONE CUT
[1:02:37] <%ChoculaUltra> ya think they'll go for Lucio/Lucifer?
[1:02:40] <gekizenbu> implied we say, as he does an actual ahegao face
[1:02:53] <neet98> its implied shhhh
[1:03:01] <%andrei11dr> Beelz seems like a zoner
[1:03:03] <%arkv01> the butt stuff is more aggressive in the localization
[1:03:04] <@Solidus_113> changing stance during that slash combo is usually optimal
[1:03:06] <+xir0gravity> Also Vas isn't bottom 3 anymore
[1:03:10] <%SirGO0SE> its a shitty super
[1:03:10] <+ghostfaceninja_> i see Woolie still picking the boss character Kappa
[1:03:11] <%thunderhog> in the english translation maybe. way more agressive in japanese
[1:03:11] <+BaikenAndEggs> If Sturm and Drang get in, I'd loveto see them as a duo
[1:03:17] <%SirGO0SE> it barely does more than a regular throw
[1:03:22] <phatmac16> they have to be a duo
[1:03:23] <%SirGO0SE> its real bad
[1:03:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> A lot of fallen angel and demons names in this world. Who is the big JC in gran blue the MC I assume
[1:03:35] <@Solidus_113> YEAH
[1:03:37] <@Solidus_113> THERE IT IS
[1:03:40] <neet98> Drang is not the fighting type though
[1:03:45] <+BaikenAndEggs> You have to hold it.
[1:03:49] <BackwardCap> Dayun
[1:03:55] <Monstercar329> I think Woolie would main Sandalphon. Angel Virgil with summon swords.
[1:03:56] <%nothuzad> feet :)
[1:03:56] <%MisterArcanine> Woolz just FYI if someone even thinks about jumping with the SSBA on deck you can punish
[1:04:05] <neet98> if anything it'll be strum with drang assist
[1:04:07] <%thunderhog> Just tream em like android 18. Strum on point, Drang on suport
[1:04:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> real talk tho drang and sturm getting added would be fire
[1:04:08] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM

[1:05:06] <phatmac16> yup
[1:05:10] <+Deko_> you gotta use diavolo's voice when you pick this guy
[1:05:16] <neet98> he is the most popular male character
[1:05:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ok real real talk, Beelzebub's original is superior, Shalem ftw
[1:05:26] <neet98> so he is in
[1:05:29] <%Conzanagi> The most popular male character should probably get in

[1:09:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> maybe he's got heavy shit in his pockets idk
[1:09:55] <%Irridium> I don't pay much attention to the frame delay counter because that shit lies
[1:09:55] <+BaikenAndEggs> Very

[1:10:24] <%thunderhog> Woolie has embraced the lame
[1:10:32] <Nekros4442> Funnily enough Narmaya's main story in game has to do alot with the pursuit of power as well
[1:10:41] <berasite> is like we are back at cross tekken

[1:10:56] <%GingaNZ> Yo woolie, try more M-214L and raw 214L to keep him out
[1:11:17] <+BaikenAndEggs> Narmaya is the big tiddie Draph waifu we all need.
[1:11:31] <%MisterArcanine> Use the range on his kicks they got insane poke
[1:11:40] <Nekros4442> @BaikenAndEggs Saying Big Tiddie and Draph is redundant
[1:11:41] <YakumoYomi> @BaikenAndEggs But Sturm, tho!

[1:18:00] <shadowbringersletsgo> if time is money, i should be getting paid for watchign this stream bro
[1:18:03] <Monstercar329> They're definitely using Grand Vira. Hyper armor, Bits system, and halberd. Also, light goddess stand.
[1:18:10] <+tearknack> as ghostfaceninja said, time is money
[1:18:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> I started this game in June and I'm still on chapter 11 of the story I put no time into that game

[1:19:47] <%arkv01> can't wait the roster gets so huge we get a smash mode
[1:19:49] <CruxAustralis> more like MANcelot
[1:19:54] <+tearknack> people told me granblue was good but it just had wierd like, timekap loaidng stuff, so i didn't even get 5 minutes in
[1:19:55] <%ChoculaUltra> I kinda like the main story tho. The twists, the turns, the insanely soul crushing boss fight that RKOs you outta nowhere
[1:19:56] <Triplicat> FOR GLORY
[1:19:57] <berasite> LUL smash mode
[1:20:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Takning the gorillas out to play

[1:20:16] <neet98> i can see Woolie came back to his man crush
[1:20:20] <%SirGO0SE> Gran and Djeeta need flat damage nerfs
[1:20:23] <shadowbringersletsgo> no more 5m run up during block stun 5m is what they are saying
[1:20:23] <+BaikenAndEggs> There's a rumor there will be 3 passes
[1:20:25] <almost6bars> BaLancealot
[1:20:29] <%nothuzad> Gran is hard top
[1:20:30] <Triplicat> they are top.
[1:20:31] <skewerstar> DJ being there on the select screen is cringe...
[1:20:36] <%GingaNZ> Kat and gran are the best, and kat beats gran so its Kat
[1:20:37] <+xir0gravity> Lance is top
[1:20:38] <%SirGO0SE> Ferry's kit is just so good that its hard to balance bc numbers wont do it
[1:20:39] <shadowbringersletsgo> 5m spam gone oh ya baby
[1:20:47] <+xir0gravity> jeetas high mid

[1:21:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Have Woolie and Reggie seen the Narmaya+Gran intro? its soo cute <3
[1:21:08] <neet98> the f2p boi is top so people believe you can f2p GBF
[1:21:10] <concretenj> Gran isn't the absolute best character, he's just definitely top 3
[1:21:16] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus you're playing kat wtf are you complaining about reggie
[1:21:19] <Monstercar329> @janders156 There's stuff like the devil throwing a spirit bomb at angel Virgil, after dismembering Angel Cloud.
[1:21:21] <%Janders156> fighting against Kat's buttons gets me so heated lol
[1:21:21] <neet98> massive ploy by cygame
[1:21:26] <Triplicat> lance players
[1:21:28] <0pirus> LLL
[1:21:29] <%nothuzad> concretenj ye its debetable if he is the best but he is a very clear top 3
[1:21:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Janders156 story starts out weak but gets really good, gameplay is reasonably fun, but there's lots of grinding so if you want just story I don't know if it's really worth it. I play the game btw
[1:21:48] <%ChoculaUltra> @FuqBoiSlim lmao ngl, I blast through the story and I'm only recently going back with the archive thing to reread shit now that I have time
[1:21:49] <%nothuzad> and the dmg/options he has are disgusting - similar case for lancelot
[1:21:52] <neet98> "guys our game is f2p"
[1:21:53] <%Janders156> I gotcha, thanks for the info!
[1:21:56] <0cash> how do you play against lance please
[1:21:56] <+ghostfaceninja_> Cygames know EXACTLY what they're doing
[1:22:08] <+tearknack> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ what actually is the gamepaly though
[1:22:08] <gordieda20> Lance bois LUL
[1:22:22] <shadowbringersletsgo> cygames put the same characters in all their games, creating that cyverse
[1:22:22] <Monstercar329> Most likely 3 passes, sure.
[1:22:24] <+BaikenAndEggs> Not a fan of the mobile game but the story is good
[1:22:29] <%nothuzad> tearknack gear/build min-maxing and a few live inputs
[1:22:33] <%jiggy_snipe> I'm excited for Relink

[1:22:34] <+tearknack> oh

[1:22:37] <robwob2016> Dat Giant Woman in the background doe
[1:22:38] <Super_Voltekka> Violence Jack is coming to RetroCrush tomorrow. Get hyped (?)
[1:22:38] <+kyh9> Yuri Lowenthal?
[1:22:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> background waifus uwu
[1:22:40] <neet98> Cygame know how to make big money
[1:22:46] <+tearknack> @kyh9 100%
[1:22:58] <shadowbringersletsgo> "You want to play Monika/Albert/Lily? We have her in all our games" cyverse wallet time
[1:23:04] <YakumoYomi> I'm hoping Re:Link comes to PC as well.
[1:23:17] <Lamokmok> Relink looks pretty good. It will help me wait out the next Tales game maybe
[1:23:20] <+capn_trips> odd sof Vamy getting in?
[1:23:20] <%emeraldskrull> step on me
[1:23:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tearknack it's turn based, each character has 3-4 skills so you build teams around doing supers or skill synergy, also depennding on what element the characters are. But yeah turn based
[1:23:31] <%big_oki> now this is fighting games
[1:23:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> re:link is the dragon's dogma looking game right?
[1:23:37] <+capn_trips> can't type well left handed
[1:23:43] <skewerstar> It's a turn based RPG. You use your skill for each character and have one summon on your turn, then auto attack when you end your turn.
[1:23:52] <%jiggy_snipe> @FuqBoiSlim yea
[1:23:52] <Triplicat> lmaooo
[1:23:56] <shadowbringersletsgo> i know katalinas on screen, but can you type with 2 hands pls
[1:23:58] <+ghostfaceninja_> its only a matter of time before this game turns into DOA
[1:24:02] <Monstercar329> @tearknack The gameplay's a turn based RPG with a puzzle game for a equipment system.
[1:24:08] <%GingaNZ> yeahhhhhh woolie
[1:24:17] <YakumoYomi> @FuqBoiSlim Yeah, the action RPG that Platinum was previously working on. Combat looks really solid.
[1:24:18] <elrey745> @ghostfaceninja_ good
[1:24:22] <%Janders156> sucks that Platinum isn't working on Relink anymore
[1:24:22] <+Deko_> LUL
[1:24:24] <+Runato> LUL nice
[1:24:24] <Triplicat> classic
[1:24:24] <+tearknack> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ not a fan of autoattacky stuff but i do like turnbased jrpgs
[1:24:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Monstercar329 puzzle game, it hurts because it's true
[1:24:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ice ice baby~
[1:24:32] <%GingaNZ> rotate your EX moves, run away, do it again
[1:24:32] <Lamokmok> @ghostfaceninja_ I dunno, there's no mountain of DLC costumes yet.

[1:24:52] <neet98> platinum not working on relink means it can sells well
[1:24:54] <Triplicat> j.U 5L is not a mixup
