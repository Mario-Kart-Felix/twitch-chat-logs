[0:05:35] <+red_cuppa> F
[0:05:36] <+TopTieramisu> there is no K9999 in ba sing se
[0:05:36] <hassanico2> Dream Match games have been pretty awesome for the most part

[0:06:00] <joshua_42> Wonder if 15 will be a dream match

[0:07:12] <smiggyballs13> Only. Mash.
[0:07:15] <this_guy_115> SNK Heroines is canon so Shermie and New Face team are alive
[0:07:20] <andre11dr> Krizalid ,Zero ,Igniz ,Rugal, Geese and Gonetz are the playable bosses AND THEY ARE FUCKING BROKEN
[0:07:27] <MKII> the boss characters are legit not tuned for fairness
[0:07:36] <hassanico2> "Koko desuka ka?" :)
[0:07:40] <joshua_42> >SNK bosses
[0:07:42] <this_guy_115> Krizalid is fine actually
[0:07:43] <smiggyballs13> But tuned for lean?
[0:07:45] <joshua_42> >Fair
[0:07:49] <+mr_miyagucci> like K' in 13
[0:07:55] <+Spider1991> @Dumple_Roe My bad, I'm meant the youtube channel arcadeplay that have great 2k2um matches mainly from Taiwan
[0:08:02] <emperoroflightning> Hey Woolz, reminder that this is the KOF where Galactica Phantom is a SPECIAL MOVE
[0:08:05] <%FenixSeraph> did anyone ever read that old KOF manga from the Orochi saga where everyone was just Battle Tendency characters
[0:08:10] <BlackermanZX> King is queen
[0:08:12] <+mr_miyagucci> do 632146 instead of 623 in some combos so you don't do super instead of dp
[0:08:14] <eddie_hedgehog> order is processing
[0:08:14] <Davimotion96> think of like doing a half circle for a hadoken after walking forward
[0:08:21] <%FenixSeraph> the one where Kyo is dressed like Joseph Joestar complete with belly shirt
[0:08:25] <brunoberserk> ''you will not see combos tonight'' i want this on a shirt

[0:09:47] <+mr_miyagucci> game audio is arcade KI levels
[0:09:48] <%SuperKirby24> quick insert coins
[0:09:54] <tolloponik> Unliumn Deaph Mautch
[0:09:54] <defineprog> barely heard that juicy trivia
[0:09:57] <brunoberserk> k9999 = tetsuo
[0:09:58] <%FenixSeraph> I NEED to go to AKIRA
[0:10:11] <tolloponik> you mean Nameless?
[0:10:11] <+TopTieramisu> and KUSANAGI was voiced by kaneda's VA
[0:10:14] <%Terrarp> He had a Testuooo Kabedaaa moment whenever he fought Kyo
[0:10:15] <andre11dr> White jacket Kio is so cool, Hes like "Fuck your fireballs"
[0:10:17] <@Menitta> KOF is my favorite series I am terrible at
[0:10:18] <%vextalyst> KYO White Jacket is sooooo sick
[0:10:18] <+Dova573> K9999 voice sounds are so nostalgic to me
[0:10:23] <@Menitta> The characters are just SO GOOD
[0:10:25] <this_guy_115> Unpopular opinion but I dislike this OST the most out of all KoF's, except 2001, that one SUCKS
[0:10:31] <+Dova573> to the point I thought K999 came before akira
[0:10:33] <Adnor_> Benimaru's internal name during 94s production was Polnareff, that's how much of a reference to JoJo he is
[0:10:41] <Broand> Fate Zero codes
[0:10:44] <+TopTieramisu> 2k2's music and BGs were meh
[0:10:49] <%FenixSeraph> @vextalyst same, XIV Kyo sucks because it looks like a ghetto version of that
[0:10:58] <this_guy_115> it was the hairstyle
[0:11:00] <eddie_hedgehog> bet
[0:11:00] <%Terrarp> F for K9999 screaming Kusanagiiiii!
[0:11:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> Life is just one big jojo's reference when you break it down tbh
[0:11:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> The game is $5 on Fanitical for people wanting a discount
[0:11:04] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @FrostedZaibatsu
[0:11:09] <eddie_hedgehog> @FrostedZaibatsu thats where i got it
[0:11:10] <+TopTieramisu> benimaru in 94 literally had polnareff's outfit
[0:11:16] <DigitalJoshie> huh
[0:11:17] <hassanico2> " The game is $5 on Fanitical for people wanting a discount"
[0:11:17] <eddie_hedgehog> @FrostedZaibatsu got the pack
[0:11:25] <eddie_hedgehog> hte triple pack is like 13 bucks

[0:14:48] <Adnor_> Yamazaki doesn't need to go riot of the blood
[0:14:51] <hassanico2> Yep Yamazaki too nuts to go Orochi blood riot
[0:14:52] <tolloponik> if 15 doesn't come out in 2020 we can still go back to 2002

[0:17:04] <+Juriasu> SourPls
[0:17:07] <%FenixSeraph> muddy vids
[0:17:07] <hassanico2> Why's he called Taco?
[0:17:13] <%SableS139a> @TopTieramisu >tfw when Iori forced himself into an anime fighter b/c his shit would be even more busted there.
[0:17:16] <haitakaa> does woolie have flux on or something?
[0:17:34] <this_guy_115> the motion input for the crossup kick looks like a taco
[0:17:36] <DingusMcBaseball> yay
[0:17:38] <FrostedZaibatsu> Will old combos work on this version??
[0:17:41] <hassanico2> TY
[0:17:43] <this_guy_115> so mexico calls that move a taco
[0:17:45] <fernandapsdois> whats up yall
[0:17:46] <hassanico2> Much better!
[0:17:50] <BlackermanZX> I love KD 0079+ so damn much
[0:17:55] <hassanico2> @this_guy_115 that's pretty cool
[0:18:01] <smiggyballs13> There’s some serious range in this game eh?
[0:18:10] <smiggyballs13> That low kick went for miles
[0:18:17] <DSD24> Mr Karate
[0:18:25] <+Dova573> gonna need some Mexican footage too
[0:18:30] <this_guy_115> KoF is super flexible in terms of what they let you do
[0:18:35] <bhaysic> Always loved the kof combo supers
[0:18:37] <%SableS139a> Yeah, vid quality in Japan is almost always worse than ours outside of recording arcade footage for whatever reason.
[0:18:38] <this_guy_115> Most supers aren't invincible
[0:18:43] <hassanico2> The heck is this Shingo
[0:18:44] <fernandapsdois> vanilla 2002 gave takuma invisible fireball (doesnt need to be charged)
[0:18:47] <+TopTieramisu> takuma's fireball in classic 2k2 was like a fullscreen normal
[0:18:49] <hassanico2> Why's he look cool
[0:19:17] <andre11dr> If i remember correctly top 5 in this is Iori, K,Angel, Nameless,Kusanagi
[0:19:28] <DSD24> I always liked Shingo
[0:19:34] <smiggyballs13> Is there a dash with I-frames in this game?
[0:19:44] <andre11dr> Iea
[0:19:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:19:46] <this_guy_115> Shingo is the only character who can CRIT
[0:19:47] <+TopTieramisu> shingo was the shit in 98
[0:19:57] <fernandapsdois> UM didnt get rid of it, characters with a red name are alternative versions of them
[0:20:00] <COMB711> wire
[0:20:02] <Dynamite_Pete> that takuma is still in the game, this is ex takuma
[0:20:04] <Spirit_NB> That was mad damage
[0:20:16] <+MayorofEarth2> Kasumi is top 5 in 2002um
[0:20:18] <%SableS139a> Isn't Shingo usually at least a solid fighter despite being no more than a jobber in KoF canon?
[0:20:20] <andre11dr> This game has 5 Kio's btw
[0:20:22] <this_guy_115> This will just be "Lets look at auck combo videos"
[0:20:24] <+Dova573> man these select screen sound effects are my Favorite
[0:20:28] <BlackermanZX> Yeah EX versions
[0:20:32] <brunoberserk> normal takuma = invisible fireballs but ex takuma = a fucking KAMEHAMEHA
[0:20:35] <Chaos_Switch> Bring Lin back

[1:26:19] <+JayBusch> @menitta Bold statement when TvC exists lol
[1:26:19] <Thunderhog> Of course the last code i the one that stops my attempts
[1:26:19] <Adnor_> It's 5 bucks in fanatical right now!

[1:26:26] <BlackermanZX> Its really damn good
[1:26:26] <tearfuldevil> bold of you to assume we have money
[1:26:26] <%RyTYoung> steam are now sus
[1:26:30] <%zeroarturia> Its 5 bucks at fanatical right now
[1:26:30] <KAISERWAVE> Pretty much yeah
[1:26:32] <@Squdnate> It's like 5€ on Fanaticcal
[1:26:34] <@Menitta> @JayBusch I know what I said.
[1:26:35] <+Fenrein> for what you're paying it's absolutely worth it
[1:26:36] <KAISERWAVE> it has SO many characters
[1:26:36] <+mMayrro> it's definitely my favorite KOF
[1:26:38] <EGus0> 98
[1:26:38] <greasystreams> It costs less than a Big Mac meal
[1:26:49] <heartlesshealer> stream's choppy during install, but I obtained 2ZRFC code.
[1:26:51] <Joezombiefoe> throw your momey at kof plz
[1:26:51] <greasystreams> 98 11 2002 13
[1:26:52] <SpookyBeef7> I usually hear either this or '98.
[1:26:53] <alephalpha> oh then yeha I'll totlaly pick it up
[1:26:54] <+Lillowh> Why not fightcade 2?
[1:26:56] <calebstanford9> 98 is my KoF too tbh
[1:27:04] <@Menitta> XI also has Wild Wolf
[1:27:04] <KAISERWAVE> @Lillowh it's not on fc
[1:27:11] <taquito_blade> which kof was given?
[1:27:11] <HelluvaNohbody> No Heavy D! BibleThump
[1:27:12] <%DanloTheManlo> Which KOF game would have like the biggest player base you bros think?
[1:27:19] <alephalpha> who's the mixup setplay monster in this game?
[1:27:21] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @KAISERWAVE it is, but not with rollback
[1:27:22] <Joezombiefoe> 2002
[1:27:23] <+JayBusch> @menitta I mean, you’re not technically wrong, but I do really like TvC’s roster.
[1:27:24] <andre11dr> I don't know how to feel about the 14 new comers, some of them were really cool like The Sand Guy,team Brazil,and the DLC girl, but then there were some Korean fanart levels od design like the guy with green hair
[1:27:28] <tearfuldevil> @Lillowh cause the devs are in chat lol
[1:27:30] <+Fenrein> This version will probably not sustain the same playerbase that fightcade does sadly
[1:27:34] <@Menitta> TVC is sick I'll give you that
[1:27:35] <Revzero25> 14 was my first but 97 is my fav
[1:27:37] <jotarokujo9> @woolieversus are going back to play mk11 and you ready to be rambo aka Sylvester Stallone mileena and rain
[1:27:43] <@Menitta> I just love the feel of KOF also with Tag
[1:27:43] <KAISERWAVE> @Reverend_Roscoe, no. It's not. This is UM. There is no neogeo version of UM
[1:28:25] <%ChoculaUltra> who would you even have to talk to get a new CvS on the drawing board? Capcom? SNK? Both?
[1:28:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @KAISERWAVE You're right, it's not UM
[1:28:31] <Kei_Ar_> 15? 10/15/2020? kof 15? take the 1 and move it you get 00/2021 kog 15?
[1:28:31] <Adnor_> UM changes a ton from vanilla 2002, they're basically completely different games
[1:28:35] <heartlesshealer> Good luck to everyone on next giveaway game whenever in the future! I'll stay out of it and just watch normally
[1:28:42] <calebstanford9> Hope I can grab a match maybe, little rusty but it'd be fun
[1:28:44] <+wmeldrum> downloading now! i'll see you online! thx again
[1:28:45] <%Josef_Stryker> Shun-ei is too tryhard in terms of his character design
[1:28:54] <KAISERWAVE> naming is hard haha
[1:28:57] <%Josef_Stryker> Same goes for the guy with Narcolepsy
[1:28:58] <andre11dr> 98 is Ultimate Match
[1:28:59] <+JayBusch> That’s the Chinabux for you
[1:29:04] <+mMayrro> LUL I thought you were saying it wrong on purpose
[1:29:08] <heartlesshealer> thank you for rollback beta instructions
[1:29:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> WE IN THERE
[1:29:16] <+MayorofEarth2> XIII is XIII
[1:29:19] <%Josef_Stryker> Mian is cool tho
[1:29:24] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm like 100% convinced Shun'ei would be infinitely more likeable without the headphones.
[1:29:25] <heartlesshealer> U = U
[1:29:28] <andre11dr> Ultimate Match is also UM
[1:29:28] <+mMayrro> also really cool that they're doing rollback on this I did NOT know

[1:36:52] <%FenixSeraph> KOFXII/XIII Kyo looks too much like The Foz or a palette swapped Vinny from Vinesauce for my tastes.
[1:36:54] <+mr_miyagucci> @adnor_ ok thanks
[1:37:07] <E24K_Lawson> @FenixSeraph Agreed. Kyo's jacket from the Tales of Ash saga is one of his best jackets to date.
[1:37:14] <+mMayrro> that's such a good anti-air
[1:37:24] <andre11dr> @man_in_the_red Iori is ez to play and he's really good, also theres Ryo is you just want a shoto
[1:37:44] <%ChoculaUltra> that one Iori redesign with the shorter shirt never grew on me like the Kyo redesigns.

[1:37:58] <%FenixSeraph> that said KOFXII/XIII Kyo isn't bad either
[1:37:59] <%ChoculaUltra> hell, Kyo and Iori's vanilla 14 designs still don't do it for me tbh
[1:38:00] <Bryon_Youngblood> Ooh, KOF 2002 UM :D
[1:38:01] <%FenixSeraph> just a little simple
[1:38:06] <fuji_92> Shingo time PogChamp
[1:38:07] <+the22cstomp> shingo KICKU
[1:38:07] <+mMayrro> singo KICKU
[1:38:08] <Revzero25> Shingo time
[1:38:21] <nevan_44> GET HIS ASS SHINGO
[1:38:22] <KAISERWAVE> dang shingo kicks
[1:38:25] <Bryon_Youngblood> I give Shingo credit for doing what he can even if he can't produce the Kusanagis' legendary flames.
[1:38:27] <+weeniebagel> shingo kick his ass
[1:38:37] <%FenixSeraph> KOFXIV Kyo and Iori are the worst, which is a shame because literally all five or six of the unused concept art for them was better than what we ended up with
[1:38:41] <+mMayrro> fucking just starts singing LUL
[1:38:41] <+weeniebagel> this is the start of the war of brazilian aggression
[1:38:42] <+the22cstomp> yeah shingo is naturally talented
[1:38:44] <%ChoculaUltra> exactly! Shingo can still kick ass - he just can't set you on fire LUL
[1:38:45] <CasualAlohaFriday> Shingo is an underrated character in general
[1:38:45] <+weeniebagel> canada will not survive
[1:38:48] <%FenixSeraph> and because the redesigns for the other XIV characters was still good, just not those two
[1:38:50] <Bryon_Youngblood> @FenixSeraph Do you just mean by their designs?
[1:38:53] <KAISERWAVE> @the22cstomp through lots and lots and lots of hard work
[1:39:01] <E24K_Lawson> @Bryon_Youngblood He really needs to stop relying on his notes and take his training with Saisyu (if he's still under his wing) more seriously.
[1:39:02] <Malik1002> yo he ain't reggie
[1:39:03] <+the22cstomp> imagine shingo's power if he had a flame
[1:39:03] <andre11dr> I hate the design, but move set wise I really like 14 Iori with the mix between Claw and Flame versions
[1:39:06] <%FenixSeraph> @Bryon_Youngblood yeah
[1:39:08] <+the22cstomp> unstoppable
[1:39:13] <+b_aleph> LMAO he's trying to use GP online LUL
[1:39:18] <Bryon_Youngblood> @E24K_Lawson That's for sure with Shingo.
[1:39:26] <%ChoculaUltra> calling it - Shingo is getting Blue Flames in 15. if not 15, 16. and so on. woolieMIRIN

[1:40:14] <Bryon_Youngblood> I admit, I'd see Shingo and Dan being rivals if Capcom and SNK worked together again to do a new Capcom vs. SNK, even if he and Joe had a funny rivalry in the previous games.
[1:40:15] <BlackermanZX> @fernandapsdois amazing shingo
[1:40:23] <+JayBusch> Good shit

[1:59:30] <%SableS139a> @tearfuldevil Makoto in BB's a squirrel girl
[1:59:33] <tearfuldevil> woolie's tried her out
[1:59:39] <+JayBusch> Speargirl is the girl who was formerly a guy but Magic is for girls apparently
[1:59:41] <tearfuldevil> she didn't seem to click
[1:59:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Body body body body UPPAH
[1:59:54] <+mr_miyagucci> Makoto is a squirrel girl and BB's boxer
[2:00:40] <pjbuster> is that those the moves sally acorn was using in that one video?
[2:00:55] <Bennett_Fracture> he got ball of steel...
[2:01:02] <+JayBusch> Just the one
[2:01:02] <BlackermanZX> Man i still remember playing vanessa in og 2002
[2:01:23] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Does 2002 have a Saxophone Storm variant?
[2:01:42] <+Fenrein> LMAO

[2:01:46] <tearfuldevil> LUL
[2:01:52] <chris_2999> nice
[2:01:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the fuck?
[2:02:17] <+JayBusch> @sonny_firestorm I’m not sure if it’s unique to it, but I think it has Arashi no Saxophone 2?
[2:02:24] <+JayBusch> I think?
[2:02:45] <+abigbowlofchips3> Wish SNK could make another ultimate match with the combination of KOF XIII artwork and KOF 2002 UM roster
[2:03:02] <andre11dr> Oh i just realized we haven't seen Blue Marry iet
[2:03:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Heidern looks super evil
[2:03:14] <%ChoculaUltra> he's one of the more "good" people in KoF lore.
[2:03:17] <@Menitta> Blue Mary is awesome. I just hate her moveset
[2:03:17] <+JayBusch> And offer XI’s tag system and suddenly it’s a game for everyone
[2:03:25] <%ChoculaUltra> Rugal bodied his wife and kid just to flex FeelsBadMan
[2:03:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> like "That village never existed" evil
[2:03:28] <Man_in_the_Red> @abigbowlofchips3 too bad, you'll only get the 2002 roster
[2:03:28] <%jinking79> Rugal ripped his eye out
[2:03:32] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I love Blue Mary's design, hate playing her
[2:03:35] <fuji_92> I wanna see leona at least once tonight chat
[2:03:46] <jayten0> @menitta 200% agree
[2:04:06] <Bennett_Fracture> the commend input in kof games are so strict...
[2:04:09] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Jesus I need to get into this franchise.
[2:04:11] <+Kyanta_Rojo> Who can name all the background characters this round? I see Raiden, Lola, Sokaku, and Richard so far
[2:04:17] <+Kyanta_Rojo> also Robot Maxima
[2:04:18] <@Menitta> bodybodybody uppah
[2:04:26] <+rednecked__crake> the S U C C
[2:04:27] <jayten0> kof is strict as fuck
[2:04:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> literally a blood sucker
[2:04:32] <heartlesshealer> oh dang
[2:04:43] <Dhurkst> yeah
[2:04:45] <%TheGershon> kof has some of the sickest character stories in fighting games
[2:04:45] <deafmelone> i think shigen's daughter is in the background
[2:04:46] <@Menitta> mhm
[2:04:56] <+Kyanta_Rojo> oh and their is that fat guy from art of fighting being a baloon in the air
[2:04:57] <TomCrimson> nah man I love playing Blue Mary she's fun
[2:05:06] <+Kyanta_Rojo> oh and Nakoruru
[2:05:07] <+MrJazzbo> shes fun in AS
[2:05:09] <@Menitta> KOF has the best character designs period
[2:05:20] <+PJSmooth> Robo Rocky!
[2:05:21] <Sol_Install> @Menitta fact
[2:05:24] <Aquatic_Lotus> I don't care I like her moveset
[2:05:24] <+JayBusch> Not to mention that they actually have character
[2:05:28] <RedHotBoss> so glad nakaruru is just a background character in this game
[2:05:40] <CasualAlohaFriday> @Kyanta_Rojo I think that's Cheng from Fatal Fury, not the AoF3 guy
[2:05:41] <%Josef_Stryker> The best thing about KOF is that it's fairly easy to cosplay them
[2:05:44] <RealPT1> 98 blue mary is straightforward enough
[2:05:46] <+Fenrein> GG
[2:05:51] <%Josef_Stryker> Because they just wear everyday clothes
[2:05:53] <+rednecked__crake> PedoBear S U C C

[2:07:56] <+MakishimaWolf> @JayBusch Thanks
[2:08:15] <KAISERWAVE> you mean Sinclair?
[2:08:18] <%Reverend_Roscoe> She's just lady Ryu
[2:08:24] <andre11dr> THAT'S IN THIS GAME
[2:08:26] <RayCSmooth> But Dan though...
[2:08:27] <+Superbro64> Are these VA's just naturally high pitched? Does it hurt to speak so high for long voice acting sessions?
[2:08:29] <+Qsmash_> Can't blame SNK for clapping back...
[2:08:32] <KAISERWAVE> whoops
[2:08:35] <CasualAlohaFriday> That's one of the best things about her, tho
[2:08:36] <+Superbro64> Questions I think about as my ears bleed
[2:08:37] <%TheGershon> Sakura WHO??
[2:08:38] <fuji_92> yuri's great Woolie's just butthurt
[2:08:42] <jayten0> but Athena tho.......
[2:08:44] <deafmelone> getting revenge off of dan for yeaaars
[2:08:47] <DEKiNZOUND> She has a litteral raging demon in 2001 @WoolieVersus
[2:08:47] <pjbuster> don't know anything about Kof but yuri looks like sakura
[2:08:47] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus do that twice with the special punch for a followup
[2:08:56] <%Josef_Stryker> BURNING
[2:08:57] <+Qsmash_> but AoF was by the original SF creator tho
[2:08:58] <1AbuOmar1> ryo and robert were the original punchman and kickman though
[2:09:06] <%Solidnick18> baby rock
[2:09:08] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp
[2:09:08] <GreatJumps> BURNNIN
[2:09:10] <heartlesshealer> !!!
[2:09:11] <jayten0> ARE YOU OK?
[2:09:11] <+Kyanta_Rojo> That's Yuri's whole hook. She mastered Kyokugen in a week where all the dudes had to do it in their whole lifetime
[2:09:14] <fuji_92> PogChamp
[2:09:16] <%Josef_Stryker> BABBY ROCK BabyRage
[2:09:19] <CasualAlohaFriday> She's always kind of been a knockoff character, in a way; even in AoF2, sort of
[2:09:25] <+TheIntellectional> thats good
[2:09:25] <%Solidnick18> let me be baby rock
[2:09:27] <ultimateanarchy5> Didn't Yuri steal the Raging Demon at some point
[2:09:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Wait, KOF predates Garou?
[2:09:31] <alephalpha> isn't learning things instantly like her whole deal
[2:09:38] <CasualAlohaFriday> @ultimateanarchy5 2001
[2:09:39] <jayten0> duh
[2:09:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Oh, takes place
[2:09:41] <UltimateDomon> Nah timeline wise its years before Garou
[2:09:45] <fuji_92> yeah, Garou is kof future
[2:09:46] <+Kyanta_Rojo> Is that Rock? I forget but I thought it was someone else
[2:09:55] <@Menitta> KOFXIV is such a dream match
[2:09:55] <Chaos_Switch> Sone mama shine
[2:09:59] <emperoroflightning> hes non-canon in xiv
[2:10:00] <1AbuOmar1> @Reverend_Roscoe KOF and garou are a different timeline
[2:10:05] <@Menitta> Like Geese and Rock are in that game
[2:10:08] <tearfuldevil> i mean is kof 14 not 12 years after 2002
[2:10:09] <jayten0> what's up with May lee???
[2:10:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @1AbuOmar1 AHHH gotcha
[2:10:11] <Dhurkst> @qsmash_ iirc, it was just the artist in AoF
[2:10:13] <alephalpha> tbf a lot of character are non canon all over the place
[2:10:15] <alephalpha> like geese
[2:10:18] <deafmelone> i mean, 2003 and XI have garou terry
[2:10:27] <jayten0> she's a superhero or something?
[2:10:30] <%zeroarturia> yeah kof and the fatal fury series are 2 seperate timelines
[2:10:32] <@Menitta> Was 2003 any good
[2:10:33] <+JayBusch> AOF is the 80s and KoF is in the 90s, otherwise the Kyokugen team would be ooooooold
[2:10:37] <alephalpha> are we ready for old man iori and kyo?
[2:10:39] <Kei_Ar_> shes sick
[2:10:40] <jayten0> ahhhhhhhhhh
[2:10:42] <%TheGershon> yeah kof is it's own continuity from fatal fury
[2:10:42] <+scorpiozilla> @alephalpha Geese is canon is KOF
[2:10:45] <CasualAlohaFriday> I thought AoF was the late 70s?
[2:10:49] <andre11dr> But isn't Fatal Fury a different time line?
[2:10:56] <+SaltySombrero> 03 was a beta for XI
[2:11:01] <+JayBusch> Was it late 70s?
[2:11:02] <1AbuOmar1> 2003 was not good competitively
[2:11:04] <alephalpha> @scorpiozilla I mean geese is dead for mos tof the kofs right?
[2:11:05] <UltimateDomon> Like how 12 was a beta for 13
[2:11:06] <+Kyanta_Rojo> Yeah 2003 is to XI like XII is to XIII
[2:11:08] <@Menitta> Ah ok. XI is the shit
[2:11:10] <%zeroarturia> so Rock is an actual character and is canon
[2:11:12] <CasualAlohaFriday> AoF, FF, Fu'un, and Last Blade are in a different timeline from KoF
[2:11:14] <+JayBusch> I always forget, either early 80s or late 70s
[2:11:16] <+scorpiozilla> @alephalpha No, he never dies in KOF
[2:11:16] <1AbuOmar1> but some great characters, i love shen
[2:11:18] <%jetjagger222> ggs to whoever i was fighting if they were in chat; kasumi is a beast
[2:11:20] <%Josef_Stryker> What's the order of the KOF games again?
[2:11:25] <+awkward_billy> 2006 or gtfo
[2:11:29] <UltimateDomon> 11 rules
[2:11:30] <@Menitta> Xi is easily my favorite
[2:11:33] <+Kyanta_Rojo> KoF XI was great
[2:11:36] <%Josef_Stryker> When did they stop counting them by uears?
[2:11:37] <alephalpha> @scorpiozilla I swear it was ajusta dream match I mena then hpw does terry have rock here?
[2:11:39] <%Josef_Stryker> *years
[2:11:40] <+Spider1991> 11 is fine
[2:11:49] <deafmelone> OSWALD RULES
[2:11:50] <lambretime> KoF XIII will always be my fav.
[2:11:52] <jayten0> oswald vs valkenhyn
[2:11:52] <UltimateDomon> 11 has Gai whos sick
[2:11:53] <emperoroflightning> Xi is underrated
[2:11:53] <+Kyanta_Rojo> KoF XI had so many guest characters too even if they were busted
[2:11:54] <+JayBusch> 2003 is the last Year-labeled one, I believe
[2:11:55] <+TheLastStar> Oswald is the raddest
[2:11:58] <+Doc1790> @WoolieVersus About that. Yuri is the clapback character to Dan so she openly mocks the Shotos. But what makes it funny is in every game she is recommended by SNK as the character for beginners implying that Shotos are for babies.
[2:11:59] <Chaos_Switch> OSWALD AND DUCK KING BAYBEEEEE
[2:12:03] <Sol_Install> i wonder if 15 will bing that back
[2:12:03] <+the22cstomp> XI has duck king
[2:12:09] <@Menitta> XI has the most garou characters too
[2:12:10] <+Superbro64> I'll be honest, I thought EVERYONE and their grandmothers hated Ash
[2:12:11] <Boomcannon> SILBER
[2:12:12] <%jetjagger222> YEAH DUCK KING
[2:12:12] <+the22cstomp> that makes it top 3 KoF
[2:12:14] <alephalpha> shoto's are for babies
[2:12:14] <fuji_92> King baybee Pog
[2:12:17] <+scorpiozilla> @alephalpha KOF and Fatal Fury are different timelines
[2:12:23] <HelluvaNohbody> Fucking Adilhied rules
[2:12:23] <1AbuOmar1> gai tendo is dope..Grappler baki homage
[2:12:24] <alephalpha> wait wut
[2:12:26] <jayten0> oh god.......ATHENA
[2:12:26] <%Solidnick18> oh that game
[2:12:35] <andre11dr> @josef_stryker 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 2001 2002 2003 XI XII XIII XIV
[2:12:35] <%zeroarturia> @alephalpha Remember The Kof timeline is seperate from the fatal fury series.
[2:12:35] <+JayBusch> SAIKOU BALLLLLL
[2:12:36] <%SableS139a> Hol' up, you serious Woolie?
[2:12:37] <UltimateDomon> Gai is sick

[2:12:41] <@Menitta> Squd why
[2:12:46] <%jetjagger222> @WoolieVersus buriki one has an active tourney scene in mikado arcade i think
[2:12:47] <%Josef_Stryker> PSYCHO BALL
[2:12:47] <deafmelone> Nests is my favorite arc, but ash arc has Oswald sooooo
[2:12:48] <pjbuster> It's all about rekkas and grapplers
[2:12:49] <+mMayrro> SAIKO BORU
[2:12:52] <+dannyo007> My Mexican senses are tingling
[2:12:54] <calebstanford9> best girl
[2:12:55] <fuji_92> SAIKOU BORU
[2:12:57] <KAISERWAVE> lmao
[2:12:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:12:58] <@Menitta> Athena has the best design in this game
[2:12:59] <+PJSmooth> Buriki One even had older Ryo as a guest character
[2:12:59] <%jinking79> he's not wrong
[2:13:00] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Squdnate why do you do this to us
[2:13:03] <GreatJumps> PSYCHOBALL
[2:13:03] <alephalpha> @scorpiozilla fair enough thanks for explainign it to me
[2:13:03] <jayten0> haaaaaaate athena so much
[2:13:07] <%SuperKirby24> I'd be down for a hyper neo geo collection ngl
[2:13:11] <calebstanford9> Athena fuckin rules
[2:13:12] <+shivvey> 2000 was the first KOF game i played at a laundromat
[2:13:12] <+JayBusch> PSYCHO BAAAAAALL
[2:13:13] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! psycho ball forever, woolie!!!
[2:13:15] <+mMayrro> god 97 athena was THE WORST
[2:13:16] <fuji_92> SAIKOU SOODO
[2:13:16] <1AbuOmar1> psychoball.wav
[2:13:18] <+scorpiozilla> @alephalpha No problem
[2:13:23] <%jetjagger222> i ike athena's moveset but i don't like her as a character
[2:13:35] <%jinking79> Hands down Kof 11 has the Worst final boss
[2:13:37] <Dhurkst> @doc1790 sure that implication isn't just your interpretation?
[2:13:39] <CasualAlohaFriday> Athena's voice from 98 on was okay. Before that the voices were painful
[2:13:39] <+mMayrro> her max2 in this is so cool
[2:13:41] <+TheIntellectional> and everyone heard her and said "I wanna play THAT game"
[2:13:41] <+scorpiozilla> Do Psycho 13
[2:13:45] <%jetjagger222> at least she's not bao
[2:13:47] <@Menitta> 13 has the worst Athena
[2:13:51] <%jinking79> one of the worst
[2:13:51] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus DOUBLE DP WITH SPECIAL PUNCH DOES TWO
[2:13:55] <+scorpiozilla> *Psycho 9
[2:13:56] <+TheLastStar> the irony is Athena is a shrieker, but is a Pop Idol LUL
[2:13:59] <+Spider1991> but kof 11 had the best sub boss
[2:13:59] <fuji_92> fucking bao DansGame
[2:14:08] <andre11dr> I kinda like how she's actually the reincarnation of the actual goddess Athena
[2:14:14] <+Doc1790> @Dhurkst Nope
[2:14:15] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus gotta use SP
[2:14:23] <+Qsmash_> Isn't Goddess Athena technically a different person? Like her ancestor or something?
[2:14:32] <+abigbowlofchips3> @menitta She’s a nightmare in XIII
[2:14:39] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus sorry
[2:14:42] <CasualAlohaFriday> @andre11dr She's the reincarnation of the incarnation of Athena.
[2:15:00] <CasualAlohaFriday> And she's still a schoolgirl centuries in the future when the mutant uprising happens
[2:15:01] <%FenixSeraph> he's from Last Blade
[2:15:02] <pjbuster> Finla round hype
[2:15:02] <%jetjagger222> she's a pop idol version of saori from saint seiya
[2:15:04] <+PJSmooth> Kim's wife and sons are there too
[2:15:07] <%FenixSeraph> isn't he?
[2:15:09] <fuji_92> damn woolie really butthurt huh
[2:15:10] <@Menitta> I thought she just was the Greek Goddess hanging around as an idol for fun
[2:15:12] <BlackermanZX> oh look best girl
[2:15:21] <%jetjagger222> yes kim sue-il is best girl
[2:15:22] <jayten0> only thing I know about korea is suicide boy
[2:15:30] <fuji_92> King PogChamp Kreygasm
[2:15:37] <%FenixSeraph> why did KOF XIV make Kyo a Kpop boy instead of an actual Korean?
[2:15:45] <SjoeB89> Is this the one that is getting the new networking?
[2:15:48] <%FenixSeraph> legitimately confused by that
[2:15:48] <@Menitta> Who was Kim's kid in the Maximum Impact games? She was awesome.
[2:15:50] <+mMayrro> venom strike Kreygasm
[2:15:55] <arkv01> DOSHITA
[2:15:56] <%Josef_Stryker> King is 50% of the reason I prefer the character designs in KOF over SF
[2:15:57] <+PJSmooth> Jhun's girlfriend
[2:16:03] <+Qsmash_> Kyo is Japanese though
[2:16:07] <+mMayrro> PogChamp nice clutch

[3:05:24] <%Wool> wait so why is this rollback beta temporary again
[3:05:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> I finally got to see those Angel combos after all :')
[3:05:26] <Kei_Ar_> with a 2 week runback
[3:05:28] <+zedreamcast> @1AbuOmar1 they're called Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury
[3:05:29] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Was Mai's knee drop a cross-up, or a mid? Cuz I couldn't block that shit either way.
[3:05:48] <+HolyGriddles> I sense a conclusion
[3:05:51] <bazz_tv> what Street Fighter lets you have 5 bars though?
[3:05:53] <1AbuOmar1> @zedreamcast exactly but even before that. With young takuma, krauser, jeff bogard etc
[3:05:53] <SomersaultJustice> noooooooo
[3:05:53] <BalloniWright> BibleThump
[3:05:55] <ggbhtg> rip Kirbo
[3:06:00] <+Mordexai0> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:06:00] <DedlokPM> @Wool beta is temporary because they are going to release it to live eventually
[3:06:01] <ggbhtg> Kirbo a no go
[3:06:04] <+b_aleph> Geese killed Kirby
[3:06:09] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Wool proof of concept?
[3:06:11] <andre11dr> KOF deserved it to be fair
[3:06:16] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Was Mai's knee drop a cross-up, or a mid? Cuz I couldn't block that shit either way.
[3:06:18] <SomersaultJustice> once again we are denied the one true fighting game
[3:06:27] <+Superbro64> The dream of KOF XIII with rollback may be a reality
[3:06:28] <@Squdnate> @Wool It's a test to get feedback before rolling it out live
[3:06:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Anhel TOD'd Kirby its a fair trade Kappa
[3:06:39] <Dhurkst> @b_aleph BibleThump
[3:06:39] <+HolyGriddles> Can’t wait to see some top level KOF 94 plays next
[3:06:41] <+JayBusch> The best trade
[3:06:47] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> That made me really want to play KoF again
[3:06:51] <@Menitta> Kirby Fighters 2 has a ton of cool fanservice to be fair
[3:06:55] <arkv01> we peaked with kof, kirby will have to wait for when we recharge
[3:06:55] <+Mordexai0> Booo
[3:06:57] <SomersaultJustice> you're gonna have to unlock stuff for it

[3:07:04] <GeltonZ> I wanna know more about Cheerleader Kirby.
[3:07:06] <%Reverend_Roscoe> aw man, no kirby and no asskicking

[3:07:39] <+Fenrein> Code Mystics are doing incredible work
[3:07:41] <+Mordexai0> I would like to see KoF 11
[3:07:49] <ggbhtg> KOF Maximum Impact, the TRUTH goal Kappa
[3:07:49] <GeltonZ> @Mordexai0 SAME.
[3:07:52] <dweebenheimer20> 98 UM is definitely next
[3:07:58] <+Fenrein> I couldn't imagine KoF 15 without rollback though. I feel like SNK have to have learned by now
[3:07:59] <Man_in_the_Red> 5 dollars btw
[3:08:01] <1AbuOmar1> yes! thanks for promoting the game guys!. I'll see you all online
[3:08:10] <+Mordexai0> @ggbhtg Apparently Regulation A is good
[3:08:11] <%Josef_Stryker> That was fun
[3:08:23] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus I am from Denmark, and I felt no hiccups

[3:09:00] <+HolyGriddles> Is this the future?
[3:09:02] <SomersaultJustice> SC6 pls
[3:09:10] <+stephaniesadgirl> so question, why do games now have such problems with netcode if they had it solved?!
[3:09:12] <+mr_miyagucci> code mystics really are mystical
[3:09:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:09:15] <Dhurkst> Code MYSTICS is right, jfc
[3:09:15] <arkv01> please understand
[3:09:17] <1AbuOmar1> the future is now
[3:09:18] <@Menitta> this is the solution to lag
[3:09:20] <BlackermanZX> Its pretty amazing
[3:09:20] <andre11dr> Im really happy you do this, KoF probably has my favorite caracters in all of fighting games
[3:09:21] <+jiggy_snipe> the 2d fighters have no excuse
[3:09:22] <Saberkai> sajam would be proud
[3:09:24] <+mMayrro> breaking news rollback is good
[3:09:26] <arkv01> we will not stop fighting until rollback is everywhere
[3:09:27] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus It's not a dead horse until you get Sajam, Max, and Infil all in one room
[3:09:29] <+cvp5127> woolie we arent developers LUL
[3:09:30] <rasamune> Repeat it all you want, it bears repeating
[3:09:34] <+HolyGriddles> @woolieversus any news on a console/PS4 release?
[3:09:40] <+Superbro64> I think it's pretty known that the people here right now ARE people that care about fighting games online
[3:09:40] <%trustycoyote> @stephaniesadgirl The biggest riddle that no one has an answer for
[3:09:42] <+Fenrein> looking at ArcSys
[3:09:47] <1AbuOmar1> nahh..if people like you didnt talk about it it would not happen as fast. good looks
[3:09:51] <+JayBusch> But if you keep saying it, eventually stuff changes
[3:09:52] <%Lunchbox53> Lunchbox53 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months!
[3:09:56] <+Fenrein> at least they've learned for Strive, but so many good games gone by the wayside
