[0:04:45] <ink_dino> drakengard lore be like PJSalt
[0:04:48] <@mothmandraws> however it might not work in ff14 land due to it already having magic
[0:04:51] <iosephe> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[0:05:15] <@Solidus_113> yeah, you hear the Watchers and they give you a choice: Become a slave of Legion or turn into salt
[0:05:23] <ponch44> question
[0:05:26] <+pissdegaulle> or what if it'slitteraly just salt (like actually)
[0:05:27] <@Solidus_113> that's White Chlorination
[0:05:30] <DatAsuna> destruction
[0:05:33] <ponch44> is this spoilers

[0:06:25] <sw_paladin> seed off destruction can travel universes and stuff
[0:06:31] <sw_paladin> of*
[0:06:32] <%andrewofbob> Does Gilgamesh just riddle the 4th wall so hard such that other continuities flood in?
[0:06:38] <+blue_cloak552> @WoolieVersus Read the final coin
[0:06:38] <ponch44> good luck on the stream woolie
[0:06:42] <@Solidus_113> The Seeds only appear when "A world is in it's final days"
[0:06:56] <ManaHerbs_> Hey how’s everyone doing?! KonCha
[0:06:59] <sw_paladin> @andrewofbob yep, good ol Greg
[0:07:02] <%Kain5707> do you guys think Woolie would like Emet?
[0:07:02] <@Solidus_113> They do that in drakengard
[0:07:08] <@Solidus_113> it's angelic text
[0:07:10] <DatAsuna> angelic text
[0:07:13] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[0:07:14] <DatAsuna> yeah
[0:07:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> did they talk about the theory craft yet?
[0:07:26] <zehdre> FF14 Newalker: A Realm Re-Reborn
[0:07:28] <DatAsuna> not yet
[0:07:39] <Goraka91> PJSalt
[0:07:56] <+krispen_wa> Remember that Adam and Eve showed the Watcher Symbol in Nier Automata
[0:07:58] <Darren716> Where do the dwarves factor in tho?
[0:08:00] <+Rafraud> The coin sasy how doesn't it?
[0:08:04] <+dotrook> have you looked at the coin description?
[0:08:10] <%SirGO0SE> whats good kings and queens
[0:08:12] <slix3431> woolieU
[0:08:13] <@Solidus_113> Breach Coin
[0:08:15] <DatAsuna> not yet
[0:08:16] <+krispen_wa> @kain5707 I'm assuming he'd take the "cool, still genocide" response
[0:08:17] <+Rafraud> The coin tells how you got here @WoolieVersus
[0:08:18] <smallboops> cool speculation!
[0:08:22] <valriot> Reminder that the technology in Nier, is based on Maso using the corpse of Angelus and the Queen Beast. Its technically magic, but its technology woven.
[0:08:23] <slix3431> woolieGIRLS
[0:08:25] <smallboops> i like where hes going with this
[0:08:33] <DatAsuna> he'll read it when he's done explaining his baseline
[0:08:39] <%FackuIkari> so Salt Robots, nice
[0:08:40] <%Kain5707> @krispen_wa i miss Emet FeelsBadMan
[0:08:42] <+The_Death_Owl> and this gives us Lore Dwarves? LUL
[0:08:47] <+NYCrownlessKing> I assumed it was a synthesized seed. but its purpose and use was revealed by the mimicry of what they synthesized
[0:08:47] <+Tarviti> Well the seeds can show up in any world, the only reason they showed up in Drakengard when they did is the barrier they created was destroyed
[0:08:52] <%CodenameChaz> Yup, he'll get to the coin, right now just refreshing his thoughts
[0:09:02] <+krispen_wa> @kain5707 i don't. he was a mass murdering asshole
[0:09:06] <smallboops> screaming happens a lot in DG/nier doesnt it
[0:09:11] <sw_paladin> so in a sense, it's "magitech"
[0:09:12] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! time, man. what even is it? circles in triangles in squares?
[0:09:13] <%Kain5707> @krispen_wa :)
[0:09:14] <+Story_Ark> why does the potato have a fork
[0:09:17] <Buzzard42> @krispen_wa yeah but he was hot
[0:09:30] <%X2Eliah> Unbirth?
[0:09:37] <+Dragon4234> We the number one 14 streamer Yeah, 14, we 'bout to get down (get down) Ten wipes on the board right now Just wiped out Madden Town
[0:09:39] <smallboops> zero screams, adam and eve scream, robots scream, mother angels a scream off
[0:09:41] <+krispen_wa> @buzzard42 fuck,you're right. he was M O R A L L Y G R E Y
[0:09:48] <DatAsuna> N2 was becoming as god :P
[0:09:52] <valriot> The implication is that the technology in Nier, down to the Machine/Yorha network, is STILL the Queen Beast magic based. Its a kind of Ghidorah to Mechagodzilla situation
[0:09:55] <@Solidus_113> The 'Longing' data entry from the bunker talks about that as well
[0:10:02] <%Kain5707> Emet had reasons
[0:10:04] <DatAsuna> I thought you noticed that during the fight when you said the digital stuff
[0:10:14] <smallboops> maybe screaming is more related to intoners than just being angry
[0:10:21] <%Rixstarian> The attack name is literally named Rhythm Score
[0:10:31] <DatAsuna> @valriot or the flood lol
[0:10:32] <@Solidus_113> It becomes an Intoner
[0:10:47] <@Solidus_113> but a weird digital fake one? based on the human memories
[0:10:52] <+krispen_wa> One is best intoner girl don't @ me
[0:11:00] <+panlakes> screaming is just anime as shit
[0:11:02] <DatAsuna> @krispen_wa Three is best girl
[0:11:12] <+Tarviti> You can't start as an intoner tho, an intoner is what is created when a queen beast is split into parts
[0:11:13] <smallboops> see i figured the seeds were a machine lifeforms fabrication or something. a simulacrom of seeds
[0:11:16] <sw_paladin> 2 was best girl
[0:11:20] <smallboops> simulacrum*
[0:11:22] <slix3431> woolieONEGUY
[0:11:32] <slix3431> woolieS woolieU
[0:11:33] <DatAsuna> 4 did nothing wrong
[0:11:40] <DatAsuna> It's not manslaughter if they're elves
[0:11:47] <%Axle13j> woolieSHOOK
[0:11:48] <%Kain5707> vargDorf
[0:11:57] <DatAsuna> Now read the coin
[0:11:58] <%X2Eliah> Drakenguards didn't have scrawl-like writing themes? I kinda think they had the "heavenly" script embedded in some of the magic-attack templates kinda
[0:11:59] <smallboops> good schpiel :V
[0:12:03] <@Solidus_113> read the breach coin @WoolieVersus
[0:12:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> its also there to explain why was it the face of the red girl and 2b that came out the orb
[0:12:07] <+Rafraud> Read coiin
[0:12:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> (i got an idea ofc)
[0:12:13] <valriot> Seems like the machine network is trying to redo the event it is, due to magic. Logic Virus is essentially the Red Eye Disease ect
[0:12:13] <+QueequegTheater> Man, imagine being a Queen Beast but the minute you're born a Final Fantasy protag shows up and fucking claps you
[0:12:15] <slix3431> woolieTRASH
[0:12:19] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> cooooooiiiin
[0:12:19] <+blue_cloak552> @WoolieVersus Read the coin from the tower
[0:12:19] <smallboops> theres no script on the seed when furiae gets put in the seed in ending B right?
[0:12:23] <+Tarviti> @smallboops I think it's implied that the seed created the network as a form of self defense as it made it's way into the world
[0:12:27] <slix3431> woolieS
[0:12:32] <slix3431> woolieU

[0:13:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> OH THAT ARC
[0:13:54] <smallboops> either they remade the arc, or the stupid ship landed on eorzea~
[0:13:57] <+Rafraud> YES
[0:13:57] <DatAsuna> If I was doing a comp of this, this is where I could pause and picture in picture the clip of you saying you hope it wasn't that. lmao @WoolieVersus
[0:13:57] <%Dirtamus01> Dirtamus01 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Sup
[0:14:00] <+pissdegaulle> and you destroyed it all you monster
[0:14:00] <+krispen_wa> The machines never got their happy ending they wanted BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:14:01] <valriot> End of Automata, the Arc WENT TO FUCKING FF14 LUL
[0:14:01] <iosephe> C A N N O N
[0:14:02] <+Tarviti> Well we already knew the tower was the arc, that's not new info
[0:14:04] <CoffeeSlice> oh no
[0:14:05] <%Rixstarian> It's after the written ending that follows Automata
[0:14:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> OH SHIT

[0:14:08] <%kyh9> CANON

[0:14:13] <Jashter18> Ending FF
[0:14:14] <+ChrisAlgoo> yoko taro can't keep getting away with this
[0:14:20] <%X2Eliah> They did say that the Arc might float in space for who knows how long'
[0:14:20] <%FackuIkari> The arc landed in FFXIV?
[0:14:20] <slix3431> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:14:26] <%CodenameChaz> @Tarviti The tower wasn't the Arc. It was a launching system for the arc
[0:14:30] <+VongolaGearX> god ol yoko
[0:14:38] <iosephe> Woolie needs to play FFXIV now because it's all canon to Drakenier
[0:14:42] <+D00msDayDan> the machines launch their ark into space and 9s piggybacks
[0:14:44] <%Dirtamus01> woolieLORE HypeKick
[0:14:44] <@mothmandraws> omega managed to fly here, arc might have crossed the void and made it here
[0:14:48] <DatAsuna> God is this the genshin/Honkai arc all over again?
[0:14:55] <+NYCrownlessKing> was C the ending of 9s going to space or D?
[0:14:56] <DatAsuna> *ark
[0:14:57] <%Rixstarian> @fackuikari The Arc landed elsewhere. The Seed connected the landing spot to FFXIV
[0:15:03] <Canadian_Suit> I can't get it out of my head that Minh doesn't give a single shit about Woolies theorycrafting. I just get that feeling
[0:15:04] <%kyh9> Canon landing
[0:15:04] <@Solidus_113> Remember, the Tower is all the Machine Network and Red Girls
[0:15:06] <+Rafraud> I'm so glad they read it lmao
[0:15:09] <smallboops> the real question is how did nobody see the arc land on eorzea
[0:15:11] <+Tarviti> @CodenameChaz What it launched was just data, nothing physical so you could argue the cannon itself was the arc
[0:15:12] <+charp35> @NYCrownlessKing C was the 9s ending
[0:15:12] <+Rafraud> Afraid they were gonna skip it
[0:15:12] <+panlakes> i guess im not shocked my automata fan brethren were also FF fanbois
[0:15:14] <slix3431> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:15:14] <valriot> Whats interesting, is that the Watchers "goal", is to essentially invade worlds, so The Arc was a DIRECT attack, not a "freedom of life"
[0:15:16] <%kyh9> FFXIV IS IN FACT NIER 3
[0:15:17] <%FackuIkari> oh fuck
[0:15:21] <RamenRiderZ> Yo, Hildibrand on Nier when
[0:15:23] <+QueequegTheater> @woolieversus Minh, do the weekly stuff and show him the messages, there is more information he needs to see
[0:15:28] <Daniel_Is_I> And thus, lore-important dwarves.
[0:15:30] <Louie_Salmon> Super Canon because of the Super Cannon
[0:15:31] <DatAsuna> well it's like Nier 2.1
[0:15:32] <smallboops> OH
[0:15:37] <smallboops> that means this can not be canon
[0:15:37] <slix3431> Where is 2B's butt tho?
[0:15:39] <%Rixstarian> @nycrownlessking D is 9S.
[0:15:42] <GalaxyUni> Nier fans finding out they gotta play FFXIV to get to this
[0:15:42] <smallboops> this could be a BRANCH
[0:15:43] <MKII> weirder things have happened
[0:15:44] <slix3431> Was that saved?
[0:15:45] <+The_Death_Owl> Nier 5.5
[0:15:46] <+krispen_wa> SO FFXIV IS CANON TO DRAKENGARD
[0:15:47] <+Rafraud> Its however many years after Automata
[0:15:47] <asakura_ayase> It’s actually drakengard 4
[0:15:52] <+Rafraud> But yeah super canon
[0:15:54] <+NYCrownlessKing> you need to read the leaked anogg notes that are sent to the player weekly because this gives more context to Ending C and we shouldn't take weeks to find this info out @woolieversus
[0:15:58] <smallboops> okay when does accord show up
[0:15:59] <DatAsuna> Nier 3 will have no 2B but will have some secret allusions to them
[0:15:59] <Lavrohas> oh we aint done woolie Kappa
[0:16:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> was the plan for the arc to land back on earth or another planet?
[0:16:02] <+NYCrownlessKing> its available on reddit
[0:16:02] <%SirGO0SE> coin keep :)
[0:16:05] <slix3431> Also why are there all these children?
[0:16:05] <%X2Eliah> Draken3 also confirms that some endings are "core", forming a loop/spiral, and some endings are dead-end branches
[0:16:07] <sw_paladin> time for cannibal elezens
[0:16:07] <+panlakes> i aint feel good about that twist
[0:16:11] <+Rafraud> It answers your entire thought process lmao
[0:16:17] <slix3431> Why are there children everywhere?
[0:16:21] <@mothmandraws> @WoolieVersus you ready for konnog clone showing up in another nier game
[0:16:22] <+NYCrownlessKing> you need to read the leaked anogg notes that are sent to the player weekly because this gives more context to Ending C and we shouldn't take weeks to find this info out @woolieversus
[0:16:23] <+krispen_wa> And all the other final fantasies are canon to FFXIV, so FF and DrakenNier are in the same multiverse?
[0:16:27] <DatAsuna> mood lighting
[0:16:27] <valriot> Whats unclear, is WHY it teleported you to Tokyo
[0:16:40] <+Dragon4234> We the number one 14 streamer Yeah, 14, we 'bout to get down (get down) Ten wipes on the board right now Just wiped out Madden Town
[0:16:44] <smallboops> these losers are just jack frost >:V
[0:16:50] <DatAsuna> tokyo is just their aesthetic
[0:16:50] <smallboops> lali he-ho
[0:16:53] <%Rixstarian> @woolieversus Not quite. It landed somewhere, & the landing spot is connected here instead via the Seed that spawned 2P & Anogg
[0:16:55] <+The_Death_Owl> Tifa is the reincarnated version of 2B confirmed
[0:16:58] <+QueequegTheater> @valriot the queen beast worjed for the Japanese Tourism board
[0:16:58] <DatAsuna> don't question why tokyo was in drakengard 3 either
[0:16:59] <%X2Eliah> @valriot Well where else would they go, New York? Tokyo is the center of the world xD
[0:17:12] <valriot> @QueequegTheater LUL
[0:17:15] <+Rafraud> He still mind broken
[0:17:17] <DatAsuna> Taro just loves random skyscrapers being where they shouldn't
[0:17:29] <+Rafraud> It is them p much
[0:17:30] <slix3431> 2B's ass will survive
[0:17:30] <+Tarviti> We also currently do not know if that was the real arc and not something created by a Seed
[0:17:33] <ninnokabin> Woolie why are you here again
[0:17:37] <smallboops> laynaSip
[0:17:40] <DatAsuna> well no
[0:17:51] <%Rixstarian> @krispen_wa Not quite. Other FFs are versions of the worlds, but not quite the same. It's like pretending the other games have multiverses
[0:18:03] <DatAsuna> There's another 2B and 9S still in automata land after ending E
[0:18:17] <@Solidus_113> just their bodies
[0:18:25] <DatAsuna> The pods wake them up tho
[0:18:44] <DatAsuna> They're basically split into multiple instances of themselves now
[0:18:44] <+Tarviti> There is a book with multiple variations of them waking up after E
[0:18:49] <+NYCrownlessKing> there is a weekly quest with finalized context for 2b and 9s but the info is given once per week. the letters are all leaked on reddit if you want all the answers @woolieversus
[0:18:51] <slix3431> This child makes me uncomfortable
[0:18:58] <%kyh9> Rememeber that time that potato saved our skins?
[0:18:59] <smallboops> god what if each ending splits into a different canon but theyre all linked by backups so every ending is semi canon
[0:19:08] <+The_Death_Owl> wow the main character is a very profound speaker LUL
[0:19:14] <+NYCrownlessKing> I mean that's drakengard small
[0:19:19] <sw_paladin> where's Clemps when we need him?
[0:19:20] <RamenRiderZ> This is like when Samurai Shodown became a prequel to For Honor
[0:19:32] <TheFranss> Asking for a permission to kick lalafels like Armstrong kicks Raiden and says "dont F with this Senator"
[0:19:33] <majindusto> LORE IMPORTANT DWARVES
[0:19:34] <DatAsuna> They went to the shadow realm
[0:19:37] <Louie_Salmon> Wait why are we listening to a dwarf, they have nothing important to say
[0:19:39] <+dotrook> Drakengard 3 sort of implies that all endings are canon at the end.
[0:19:58] <%X2Eliah> @dotrook yeah
[0:20:11] <DatAsuna> but yeah basically there's multiple 2Bs and 9Ss at once now, not a true pair
[0:20:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:12] <+sugarfreemixup> neko shogun glamour
[0:20:13] <CoffeeSlice> :c
[0:20:23] <%Dirtamus01> Samurai Pizza Cats 🐈 S Tier
[0:20:32] <gunstars20> LUL
[0:20:38] <+NYCrownlessKing> there was only multiple 2b @datasuna
[0:20:41] <%Rixstarian> Papa & Brother Prot of Replicant/Gestalt both struggle for Yonah simultaneously
[0:20:54] <+NYCrownlessKing> raid only had one 9s which is why I think its Canon to the ark ending
[0:20:55] <slix3431> 2B got merc'd?
[0:20:55] <sw_paladin> @dotrook kinda like how Both Brother and Papa Nier are canon
[0:21:21] <+donpatrondx> official XIV streamer now?

[0:21:28] <DatAsuna> @NYCrownlessKing I mean at the end of automata. EVERYTHING in FF14 is seperate and duplicate
[0:21:40] <+QueequegTheater> Koji
[0:21:43] <%X2Eliah> "Everything you know is Wrong" is SUCH a good quest name
[0:21:44] <%Rixstarian> @nycrownlessking There is a written script ending that follows ending E. It has 2 endings. The bad end is if 9S goes w/ Adam to the Arc
[0:21:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Christopher Koji-Fox LOVES his puns.
[0:21:48] <slix3431> Is there poop on the floor?
[0:21:52] <+krispen_wa> where did A2 fuck off to though
[0:21:53] <DatAsuna> the 2B/9S at ending E aren't on the arc
[0:22:09] <%X2Eliah> Medieval Goop
[0:22:10] <DatAsuna> THEREFORE FF14 2B/(s are not that 2B/9S but another 2B/9S
[0:22:14] <+QueequegTheater> It's just some generic stains
[0:22:14] <%X2Eliah> it's just medieval goop
[0:22:17] <Srthunda> at least the warrior of light can successfully deliver a letter
[0:22:18] <%Mathochism> Oh snap. We're already back to FFXIV?
[0:22:18] <ninnokabin> Something else to keep in mind is that this story is also Cannon to XIV as well. All of this has rippling effects on 14's story line, and implies a lot in terms of what the nature of XIV's multi-verse is made up of.
[0:22:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> I wouldn't call that bad. but ya I think this links to 9s and Adam eve going to the arc @rixstarian
[0:22:35] <%X2Eliah> We need a high res texture of that letter
[0:22:45] <DatAsuna> The arc probably just didn't spit an A2 out
[0:22:49] <+NYCrownlessKing> I think this ff14 9s is automata 9s. but I don't think this 2b is the real 2b
[0:22:49] <+ClericOfSparda> hello
[0:22:59] <sw_paladin> It's Dante's smash invite
[0:23:12] <%Rixstarian> @nycrownlessking No, I mean, the bad ending is that when 2B & the Pods try to revive 9S, his consciousness isn't there & it fails. Him staying behind to be an Android again is the good end
[0:23:12] <+SunnyVarietyPack> they all the same
[0:23:13] <%FackuIkari> Did A2 even got into the arc?
[0:23:14] <%Jaxnos> minh murders things with that fork.
[0:23:15] <+dotrook> Im glad this all happened on the 1st and that our WOL who is a god killer was here. A seed and flowers showing up in a world usually means it's a lost cause.
[0:23:16] <+NYCrownlessKing> reason I think so is in the konogg anogg notes from the weekly quest
[0:23:17] <smallboops> everyone is an adult of 18~27 in ffxiv
[0:23:20] <sw_paladin> they age like humans
[0:23:21] <%X2Eliah> Dwarfs are small so they should have shorter lifespans
[0:23:26] <+Tarviti> The FF14 androids are data copies created by the SoD as part of it's self defense abilities
[0:23:29] <%X2Eliah> The bigger a lifeform is, the longer they live
[0:23:30] <@mothmandraws> ff14 all races live up to 80-100 iirc except rabbit
[0:23:34] <@mothmandraws> so about same as humans
[0:23:42] <ninnokabin> No Lala's live the longest
[0:23:46] <Cryomancer_Maurice> none of that dnd aging bs
[0:23:47] <ninnokabin> And Elezen second
[0:23:49] <2DSuperiority> I think we've only seen kid lalafells a few times but they look the same as the adults
[0:23:49] <slix3431> Rabbit die at 12
[0:23:51] <+sugarfreemixup> @mothmandraws elzen live longer too iirc
[0:23:52] <sw_paladin> elezens live somewhat long
[0:23:57] <@mothmandraws> viera live for literally 3-400 years
[0:23:57] <Daniel_Is_I> Elezen live to around 120, Viera live like 300
[0:23:58] <jaysondeez> rabbit lives to like 300
[0:24:02] <ninnokabin> Wait no sorry, Bun's are teh longest lived
[0:24:06] <MemMoor> this track always hits
[0:24:09] <ninnokabin> Lala's second
[0:24:09] <smallboops> in conclusion aymeric is a gilf
[0:24:13] <faldin> Elezen also hit puberty around the 20s
[0:24:21] <olaksi> long enough to remember
[0:24:23] <+QueequegTheater> @woolieversus So it's a really good thing you had an FF protag around when the Queen Beast showed up
[0:24:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> STRIKE
[0:24:28] <TheFranss> Whattabout the weird dragon ones? Auras where they called? How long they live?
[0:24:28] <%LittleCinders> !uptine
[0:24:32] <+QueequegTheater> Otherwise the world would be fucked
[0:24:36] <%X2Eliah> ...
[0:24:38] <%DashXero> The Rabbit Threat must be eliminated. If left unchecked, they could take over.
[0:24:38] <%X2Eliah> really
[0:24:44] <gunstars20> LUL
[0:24:45] <%X2Eliah> a mount flight for that short distance
[0:24:47] <%Zepik> Wait is woolie starting to feel something for these lore important dwarves?
[0:24:47] <@mothmandraws> au ra live same as others, just their lifestyles usually mean they die young
[0:24:48] <Daniel_Is_I> Boy is it
[0:24:49] <Buzzard42> LUL
[0:24:52] <OldManDeckardCain> thx pat Kappa
[0:24:54] <%LittleCinders> yay Woolie Strim!
[0:24:57] <Riorii> you should see patch day.
[0:25:09] <@mothmandraws> au ra have their fortnite battle royal every year where half population probably dies
[0:25:12] <+VongolaGearX> and now its a rathalos
[0:25:12] <%X2Eliah> @OldManDeckardCain f-in Pat...
[0:25:22] <jaysondeez> in this world
[0:25:22] <%Skullgod> @mothmandraws i thoguht those were only certain au ras
[0:25:23] <@Solidus_113> Tomra
[0:25:24] <Daniel_Is_I> Tomra
[0:25:24] <%Rixstarian> Only for this Shard
[0:25:26] <+SunnyVarietyPack> no its about sin eaters
[0:25:27] <+NYCrownlessKing> but that cereberus was fucking sick tho
[0:25:28] <DevilHands_> Its a curse, for the flood
[0:25:33] <+projectmanatees> no its cause the world was buried in light
[0:25:34] <+Tarviti> The wicked white relates to the sin eaters
[0:25:34] <Daniel_Is_I> Tomra is a rival clan, from the main story quest
[0:25:34] <sw_paladin> I think it's based of the sin eaters
[0:25:34] <+KawaiiJetty> Only on the First
[0:25:35] <+QueequegTheater> No it's just a thing people on this planet say
[0:25:37] <%andrewofbob> Minh's helmet confusingly looks like it has viera ears
[0:25:38] <@mothmandraws> basically light and white is bad here
[0:25:38] <Dastardry> Only because The First had a light problem for quite a while
[0:25:38] <olaksi> their world just survived light-based apocalypse
[0:25:39] <jaysondeez> wicked white is the general exclamation for the entire world
[0:25:41] <2DSuperiority> people in the first were cursed with 100 years of the flood of light
[0:25:43] <+NYCrownlessKing> wicked white is like holy hell @woolieversus
[0:25:44] <jaysondeez> cause of flood of light
[0:25:45] <Daniel_Is_I> "Wicked white" is just an expression
[0:25:46] <SomersaultJustice> THAL'S BALLS
[0:25:49] <+dotrook> in this world, Light went crazy and almost destroyed the world.
[0:25:51] <%guyalex> how you beat this game and not know that? haha
[0:25:51] <lucky_icarus> Its based on fucked the world was with rampant light
[0:25:53] <+SunnyVarietyPack> wicked white refers to sin eaters that kill everyone
[0:25:53] <ninnokabin> They say it because the 'light' is an evil force on this world
[0:25:59] <+KawaiiJetty> it is like cursing Thal's balls or By the Twelve
[0:26:00] <+dotrook> so its wicked white and they call each other sinners
[0:26:00] <Tenkay> This planet is fucked up due to too much Light Aether and all the monster are white
[0:26:00] <@mothmandraws> warrior of darkness is chad here, warrior of light is asshole to them
[0:26:00] <jaysondeez> THAL'S BALLS
[0:26:01] <+blue_cloak552> @WoolieVersus Wicked White is because the light is Evil in that world
[0:26:02] <+CookieCutter007> By the heavens
[0:26:04] <%gitgouda> i thought the lalafell looked silly at first but the armor set is making them grow on me.
[0:26:05] <+VongolaGearX> doomed dwarf best dwarf
[0:26:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> its like saying holy fuck or holy hell but its wicked white @woolieversus
[0:26:17] <%Skullgod> dab
[0:26:19] <+NYCrownlessKing> its an expression
[0:26:28] <+QueequegTheater> BY SHEER RAGE, HE FLIES
[0:26:29] <%LittleCinders> Ye gods! That's balls! Seven hells! Wicked White!
[0:26:34] <iosephe> Also might have something to do with the Sin Eaters
[0:26:43] <+blue_cloak552> Tal's balls*
[0:26:45] <@mothmandraws> the best insult is "SLOPPEY"
[0:26:47] <+blue_cloak552> Thal*
[0:26:47] <Goraka91> Black ranger pose, aka dabbing
[0:26:47] <+VongolaGearX> that octopus travler title is killing me
[0:26:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> is Woolie the top FFXIV steamer again? Kappa
[0:26:59] <ninnokabin> There was a cross over event
[0:27:03] <+Domukari> there was a crossover event
[0:27:07] <zecht89> For a second I thought Woolie started FFXIV after the last stream's popularity
[0:27:12] <DevilHands_> It was a sentai crossover event iirc
[0:27:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:27:13] <+QueequegTheater> @woolieversus official crossover
[0:27:17] <%LittleCinders> Black ranger? you mean Dab ranger
[0:27:28] <%X2Eliah> I cry everytim for dorf
[0:27:29] <SomersaultJustice> woolie once again claims the crown of top FFXIV streamer
[0:27:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> white and light is in the story context. evil the opposite of darkness and black so wicked white is used in that expression
[0:27:29] <2DSuperiority> Garo
[0:27:40] <+Thatghostpepper> there was a Garo crossover event if we're talking about tokusatsu
[0:27:48] <%Kain5707> dig site cheif always liked them
[0:27:50] <IzanagiNoOokami> Highest Potence Limit Break: Black Ranger Dab-Nado.

[0:27:54] <SomersaultJustice> you're probably handsome, so morally gray
[0:27:59] <majindusto> Square...Doing anything Mario RPG related? enigmaKEK
[0:28:01] <+NYCrownlessKing> they had a ranger reference that's in the 14 universe. so its just sentai esc poses
[0:28:02] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[0:28:05] <ulcaban> What even is anything, maan?
[0:28:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> If Woolie wants more Sentai goodness, just do the Alexander Raids
[0:28:07] <%Rixstarian> @thatghostpepper There's a ranger glamour. There was an event
[0:28:13] <%LittleCinders> @woolieversus The ranger poses were a Super Sentei crossover. also Saban, being the shit's they are prevented the ranger costumes from being available in the West!
[0:28:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BRUTE JUSTICE TRANSFOOOORRM
[0:28:22] <+NYCrownlessKing> Garo did have a crossover event in 14 @woolieversus there is legit Garo armor

[0:29:19] <%X2Eliah> @olaksi oh that's good
[0:29:46] <olaksi> i think it's from Scrooge McDuck
[0:29:48] <jaygee303> The return!
[0:29:49] <%Major_Lee_> Absolutely
[0:30:04] <+dotrook> Another reason its good we were there. We can't be tempered. So the queen beast probably couldn't force us into a pact even if it tried.
[0:30:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> CHEER FOR BLOOD
[0:30:16] <+Rafraud> HERE WE GO
[0:30:17] <%X2Eliah> JUSTICE
[0:30:18] <%Skullgod> can't be tempered if we already have a pact
[0:30:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit these potatoes need to calm down
[0:30:21] <%Skullgod> xenoBrain
[0:30:29] <@mothmandraws> lalafells are tru evil
[0:30:33] <%gatorafan> Zero chill dwarves
[0:30:37] <%ihavesillyknees> Man this is a long raid
[0:30:41] <Tenkay> reminder lalafells commit all the war crimes
[0:30:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I also forgot Brute Justice's mechs are all G1 Transformers
[0:30:43] <%DashXero> This is why people hate dwarves.
[0:30:50] <ulcaban> Down for hardcore murder?
[0:30:52] <ninnokabin> @WoolieVersus Mihn, make sure you show Woolie the Lala only house
[0:30:53] <+skylerpilot> Potatos rise up
[0:30:54] <+QueequegTheater> @woolieversus Fun fact, the FFXIV protagonist has an inherent immunity to mind control so the Queen Beast couldn't force us into a pact
[0:30:56] <%X2Eliah> DORF JUSTICE IS A HARSH MISTRESS
[0:30:58] <+KawaiiJetty> glad dwarves are also sick

[0:31:46] <%X2Eliah> Konogg just wanted to make tasteless breakfast to prevent emotions
[0:31:49] <+Rafraud> I mean the story is the whole reason they're playing this
[0:31:50] <olaksi> Yoko Taro should write all lalafels from now on

[0:32:04] <+SunnyVarietyPack> no its dwarfs
[0:32:09] <smallboops> theyre the plot relevant dwarves
[0:32:13] <+QueequegTheater> That dwarf's name is Rusty Galloway
[0:32:24] <+KawaiiJetty> Tomra dwarfs are also bad
[0:32:32] <%X2Eliah> So, are the other quests (outside of this dlc) in ff14 also feature these kinds of messed up characters?
[0:32:36] <%X2Eliah> do*
[0:32:45] <RamenRiderZ> Small and grumpy, typical dwarves
[0:32:47] <+Rafraud> I high key love this part
[0:32:51] <%X2Eliah> Or is this particularly out-of-place?
[0:32:53] <Saltmeisterr> kinda but this very much taro writing
[0:32:54] <+QueequegTheater> @x2eliah no this is Yoko Taro writing
[0:32:56] <+pissdegaulle> love this part
[0:32:57] <2DSuperiority> I was gonna say the other dwarfs are cool but then I remembered the Healer job quest

[0:34:12] <+burningface> With a Dwarf, Plead the Fourth
[0:34:17] <%DashXero> Wants to pass the sentence, but too much of a wimp to swing the sword...
[0:34:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:34:22] <2DSuperiority> @QueequegTheater well I should specify that the elder in the flashback was an asshat
[0:34:37] <+QueequegTheater> fair
[0:34:52] <smallboops> we got it woolie, its was clever laynaHuehue
[0:34:57] <%JenovasPuppet> It warms my heart to see Woolie learning the roasting Lala way
[0:35:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh my god these dwarves NotLikeThis
[0:35:21] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp alliteration
[0:35:21] <%X2Eliah> Shoulda seen it
[0:35:23] <Aquatic_Lotus> will this be on a video?
[0:35:30] <@mothmandraws> WHY DIDNT YOU SEE THE ALIEN ATTACK
[0:35:35] <majindusto> No, No...He's got a Point
[0:35:35] <%chiluzza> should have seen this potentially world ending catastrophe
[0:35:38] <+NYCrownlessKing> soooo ciiiettyy
[0:35:40] <Daniel_Is_I> But we live in one!
[0:35:42] <olaksi> I'm starting to second guess that time I helped these guys invent doomtanks
[0:35:45] <smallboops> so ciiiiiiety
[0:35:50] <%X2Eliah> I'm honestly surprised that Dig Site Chief is not named "Dig Site Chiefgg"
[0:35:50] <%PatStaresAt> oh hey guys wha happen

[0:36:08] <+KawaiiJetty> dwarfing is happening Pat
[0:36:10] <%andrewofbob> Was it Tolkien that wrote the lore that Dwarves don't have the power of Just Talk?

[0:36:31] <%SirGO0SE> @PatStaresAt psaDab

[0:36:37] <smallboops> YEAH BASICALLY
[0:36:49] <Saltmeisterr> OH SHIT TF2 is going f2p for a week
[0:36:53] <%X2Eliah> "yeah"
[0:36:54] <+dom3800> Does anyone know if the konogg weekly messages have been leaked anywhere?
[0:37:00] <+NYCrownlessKing> yes ^
[0:37:01] <%Kain5707> @PatStaresAt Woolie got real into the story he went back and read and watched the fights twice
[0:37:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> on reddit
[0:37:10] <gmbt21xd> Wait the last 3 are leaked?
[0:37:11] <gmbt21xd> dm
[0:37:12] <smallboops> as somebody who actually enjoyed the first stream, i still appreciate woolie swallowing the pill here
[0:37:12] <%PatStaresAt> Yeah I heard he watched my super good super streams
[0:37:13] <JetpackMcQuack> doomed to failure
[0:37:14] <gmbt21xd> or whisper
[0:37:14] <VizualBlitz> @dom3800 think there's a reddit thread
[0:37:20] <%X2Eliah> It takes a potato farm to grow a village
[0:37:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> all the msges have been leakes
[0:37:25] <+NYCrownlessKing> leaked*
[0:37:27] <2DSuperiority> yeah but not the cutscenes before the weeklys iirc
[0:37:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> ya just the letters
[0:37:49] <+dom3800> I've looked on the ffxiv sub but didn't see it. guess I'll keep looking
[0:37:50] <+QueequegTheater> Just cook the dwarves and give the food to the Viera
[0:37:52] <%X2Eliah> Well, this world has people ride-flying dragons and stuff anyway
[0:37:53] <+SunnyVarietyPack> true
[0:37:58] <%X2Eliah> so weird stuff is all over the place
[0:37:59] <@mothmandraws> dont talk about contents of the leaked letters
[0:38:03] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[0:38:04] <smallboops> so does this questline actually have any choices that affect the narrative?
[0:38:09] <%Skullgod> https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1388177450748682245?s=19 fresh meat on the menu
[0:38:09] <+anoldtoilet> gottem
[0:38:14] <%X2Eliah> @smallboops maybe
[0:38:18] <+QueequegTheater> @smallboops no it's self-contained
[0:38:19] <smallboops> like can you talk shit to a dwarf and make them react in some way?
[0:38:24] <majindusto> Poor Pat...Woolie went and pulled the rug out from under him and his planned rant on Monday enigmaKEK
[0:38:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> they should look at it though otherwise they'd be coming every week to read a single message @mothmandraws
[0:38:48] <%X2Eliah> urgh
[0:38:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> did these dwarves exist before these questlines? like have you helped them before or is this the first time you meet them?
[0:38:52] <2DSuperiority> we're up to week 3 right?
[0:38:52] <%X2Eliah> daytime tv
[0:38:54] <+NYCrownlessKing> and this character has already missed the previous weeklys
[0:38:54] <%X2Eliah> yuck
[0:38:58] <+skylerpilot> In an mmo usually most of the other players don't exist most of the time as far as NPCs and the story is concerned
[0:39:22] <smallboops> its a little sad that while you do get chances to express your character with choices, they dont actually do anything
[0:39:25] <%X2Eliah> Their senses
[0:39:27] <%CodenameChaz> "All we can do is try to do better" Where's Damon Wayans when you need him to walk out and shout "Message!" at the screen
[0:39:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> ya were in weekly part 3
[0:39:40] <@mothmandraws> well nyc they may have to return in 5.55 anyway if something changes
[0:40:03] <+QueequegTheater> Remember, punting potatoes is not a crime because Lalafell don't have rights
[0:40:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> they do but if they have to have all weekly done first they would be 3 weeks behind @mothmandraws
[0:40:16] <DatAsuna> I do think probably the weakest part of this is going on about their "precious memories" despite barely ever talking to the WoD before they peaced out
[0:40:17] <DudeDern> Just popping in to tell Woolie his Disco LP got me to crack and buy the game myself. The energy of that LP is INFECTIOUS. Keep up the good work Woolie.
[0:40:26] <DatAsuna> memories of what?
[0:40:35] <@Solidus_113> nope
[0:40:38] <+NYCrownlessKing> no
[0:40:42] <+QueequegTheater> no
[0:40:46] <Tenkay> not yet at least
[0:40:47] <+Huderga> no the tower is gone woolie
[0:40:49] <jaysondeez> no
[0:40:51] <Tenkay> The weeklies arent done
[0:40:55] <jaysondeez> logs now are the weekly
[0:40:58] <RamenRiderZ> Didnt it collapse
[0:40:58] <Psyramics> tower went away immediately after raid, weeklies pretty much replace it
[0:41:00] <VizualBlitz> weeklies are sort of that
[0:41:01] <Louie_Salmon> It was all hacking anyway, and 9S isn't there to hack you in
[0:41:37] <+VongolaGearX> lol pop

[0:42:12] <JetpackMcQuack> You've created a time paradox
[0:42:12] <Klefth> Ohay Pat

[0:42:49] <+OblivionSword1> @QueequegTheater this is Minh's alt isn't it ?
[0:42:56] <+CookieCutter007> it's Yoko Taro
[0:42:58] <+NYCrownlessKing> yeah
[0:43:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @OblivionSword1 It is
[0:43:03] <ninnokabin> So it was you I ran into, why don't you help Rebecca more @PatStaresAt
[0:43:04] <phatmac16> You’re right Woolie
[0:43:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> that was it lol
[0:43:06] <%faeron93> Correct
[0:43:09] <+pissdegaulle> it's fan service
[0:43:23] <+NYCrownlessKing> that's most of ff14 cuz story is in chapters lol @woolieversus
[0:43:35] <+NYCrownlessKing> were literally at a climax to the next expansion
[0:43:55] <%X2Eliah> Honestly I just want to see Pat's character just dabbing his heart out in the background
[0:43:56] <%saiko2208> saiko2208 is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 10 in the channel!
[0:43:57] <%saiko2208> saiko2208 gifted a Tier 1 sub to nichos7!

[0:44:03] <+krispen_wa> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:44:03] <supersugoisenpai1> They teased the seed after the second raid, and those who knew lost their shit
[0:44:07] <ulcaban> He's one letter away from being a Doomslaying Dwarf
[0:44:11] <@Solidus_113> nope...
[0:44:12] <%JenovasPuppet> Nope
[0:44:12] <Psyramics> not yet....
[0:44:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> only costumes

[0:44:24] <%Double_Tap_That> God I wish
[0:44:24] <superchunk121> Only costumes
[0:44:25] <%JenovasPuppet> Costumes minions and songs only
[0:44:27] <+blue_cloak552> sadly no
[0:44:28] <Explodincatz> skins
[0:44:29] <@Solidus_113> WE ALL WISH
[0:44:32] <@Solidus_113> SO BAD
[0:44:32] <%JonnyFodder> Sadly no, only armour.
[0:44:34] <+Tarviti> Armor and hair
[0:44:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> music, pets and costumes
[0:44:37] <%faeron93> 24-Man raids don't get weapons
[0:44:37] <%Skullgod> NIER WEAPONS PEPW
[0:44:37] <+krispen_wa> I wish I got the Nier Automata katanas
[0:44:40] <+VongolaGearX> costumes for glamour
[0:44:44] <+dotrook> The 24 man raids traditionally dont give weapons :(
[0:44:51] <+FrostedZaibatsu> We got weapons in PSO2, but no raid
[0:44:55] <Dragon_Batman> A bummer
[0:44:56] <%JenovasPuppet> No pod mount, even thought it's in the game already!
[0:44:56] <Klefth> Dude, I so wish there were weapons, even just for glam
[0:44:59] <olaksi> it gave us butts
[0:44:59] <%Double_Tap_That> So many could've worked, though.
[0:45:00] <+dotrook> I hope they give something nice after the weekly is done.
[0:45:01] <+MTLxSpider> Its Yoshi P's Birthday btw
[0:45:05] <+QueequegTheater> To be fair that would only work for like SAM, DRG, and DRK
[0:45:05] <RamenRiderZ> No 2B katana NotLikeThis
[0:45:09] <+dotrook> I want a pod mount so bad.
[0:45:16] <+MTLxSpider> lmao
[0:45:32] <+NYCrownlessKing> I understand not having weapons cuz literally some of them would need completely new designed weapons lol
[0:45:38] <adithehella> MNK works too
[0:45:56] <+krispen_wa> they could give MCH a handheld Pod for a gun
[0:46:00] <%X2Eliah> .... children?
[0:46:08] <%X2Eliah> Woolie they are called "spuds"
[0:46:13] <%fetrigon> BASED
[0:46:19] <+SunnyVarietyPack> no
[0:46:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> No Weiss and Noir for SCH and SMN weapons, dammit
[0:46:26] <+Deebo305> had to check if this was real, thought someone hacked Woolies Twitch
[0:46:28] <+VongolaGearX> no, unfortuatly
[0:46:29] <Srthunda> is that pat?
[0:46:37] <Saltmeisterr> oh hey pat
[0:46:37] <indominus_corgi> lol pat
[0:46:37] <+NYCrownlessKing> it makes favoritism tho with weapons
[0:46:38] <+Deleted2972> have the endings been good?
[0:46:39] <Dragon_Batman> I like how Pat is just shitting it up lol
[0:46:42] <adithehella> ooo, weiss and noir for the SCH and SMN would be so cool
[0:46:43] <Klefth> Look at that sick Macross shit
[0:46:44] <+krispen_wa> @alteisenreisez fuuuuck,that is the biggest missed opportunity ever
[0:46:48] <+ChrisAlgoo> me and 23 other people going to bully the empire
[0:46:51] <%PatStaresAt> Im trying to point out the mount that Woolie was asking about last time and he's not noticing lol
[0:46:53] <bcdenton> Minh and Pat both have the superpower of being completely unable to sell this game
[0:46:55] <%Dapper_Cactuar> nope but it plays the motorcycle segment music from FF7 classic
[0:47:00] <%JenovasPuppet> Look at this fucking stream sniper!
[0:47:06] <+NYCrownlessKing> he saw it before @patstaresat
[0:47:20] <+NYCrownlessKing> he knows about the shit version flight unit
[0:47:26] <+Deebo305> @vongolagearx it's not a bad thing, FFXIV is a good game just figured Woolie would never play it
[0:47:28] <ulcaban> 'If I had a nickel for every time I was doomed by a Dwarf!'
[0:47:31] <+krispen_wa> Pat BTFO
[0:47:33] <Srthunda> I think hes just gloating
[0:47:34] <@Menitta> oh ey Pat's here
[0:47:36] <%PatStaresAt> i tried to help
[0:47:38] <EL_TRO> how embarrassing
[0:47:41] <%fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[0:47:42] <+MTLxSpider> he tried to help
[0:47:44] <+MTLxSpider> XD
[0:47:45] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt denied
[0:47:45] <+krispen_wa> But does Pat have GOLDEN Flight unit?
[0:47:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Thanks though pat
[0:47:50] <BigManLugan> pat super helpful
[0:47:51] <+QueequegTheater> Wait what did I miss what happened
[0:47:53] <gunstars20> Pat Helping Let's go
[0:47:54] <+pissdegaulle> not even nier related weirdly enough
[0:47:59] <%SirGO0SE> he tried atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:48:03] <ulcaban> There was a (Pat) attempt
[0:48:11] <%ChoculaUltra> I thought it was cool
[0:48:14] <Dragon_Batman> o7
[0:48:15] <+valiard> watch there be a secret raid built in with cool shit in it
[0:48:33] <+QueequegTheater> Is a (Pat) attempt an attempt but two feet closer to the ground?
[0:48:33] <Arazien> What? On fire and strewn with corpses?
[0:48:34] <Dragon_Batman> It already did with the fire and dead everywhere tho Kappa
[0:48:37] <+SunnyVarietyPack> are there any more raids?
[0:48:39] <+krispen_wa> what if completing the weeklies lets us fight Shin True Queen Beast
[0:48:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:48:42] <%Kain5707> its a minion
[0:48:48] <ulcaban> Needs moar tree
[0:48:49] <Louie_Salmon> That'd be too small for a mount though
[0:48:56] <+QueequegTheater> @krispen_wa and then ichiban shows up to help
[0:49:01] <%X2Eliah> Pod as a mount should have the Pod carrying the player in front, like in automata
[0:49:07] <%fetrigon> @valiard raids are too expensive to make to be secret lol
[0:49:21] <+Deebo305> @woolieversus so are you on someone else's account or have you been secretly just playing this game? I'm legit curious as I just got here
[0:49:25] <Klefth> Pod mount would've been great
[0:49:29] <+krispen_wa> I just wish we got Final Song instead of Kaine's theme for the final boss
[0:49:30] <+QueequegTheater> @Deebo305 minh's alt
[0:49:31] <%X2Eliah> @Deebo305 It's Minh's
[0:49:36] <+Deebo305> ah ok
[0:49:39] <ulcaban> Makes me think of that area of the Ringed City
[0:49:53] <%X2Eliah> @Deebo305 Woolie, unfortunately, is not yet a laallafell waifu
[0:49:56] <Tenkay> I think its the machine network trying to emulate the events of Drakengard Ending E
[0:49:59] <+QueequegTheater> It literally was
[0:50:01] <+MTLxSpider> Yeappppppppppp
[0:50:02] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:50:02] <%X2Eliah> Super is
[0:50:11] <+krispen_wa> Watchers vs Sin Eaters thooooo. that would be siiiiick
[0:50:12] <+Tarviti> It still could be
[0:50:14] <olaksi> yes but they landed on WoL so it's cool
[0:50:16] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It only didn't happen because the FFXIV protagonist is a freak badass
[0:50:16] <+Deebo305> @x2eliah I pray he never is
[0:50:17] <+MTLxSpider> were all gonna fking die.
[0:50:18] <nobody287> I mean the first just had a world ending event
[0:50:22] <%Double_Tap_That> It was, but the main character stops world-ending threats on a regular basis.
[0:50:24] <Goraka91> Yes, but we kicked it's ass
[0:50:26] <gunstars20> God killer
[0:50:26] <%X2Eliah> If they need a definite "we're shutting the servers down y'all" for FF14, this is it
[0:50:27] <+dotrook> If only Omega Weapon had encountered the Machine Network
[0:50:28] <DatAsuna> I mean technically you can ignore everything outside the game without issue
[0:50:28] <%JenovasPuppet> Eh, it's all happening on the First, and that place is practically dead anyway.
[0:50:31] <+pissdegaulle> AK-class end-of-the-world scenario
[0:50:32] <+dotrook> that woulda been a thing
[0:50:32] <%Rixstarian> @woolieversus The Arc didn't land there. It landed somewhere that the Seed connected to XIV
[0:50:35] <JetpackMcQuack> They're used to it, like the cold war
[0:50:36] <+dotrook> or met Alexander
[0:50:37] <Psyramics> its kinda nuts that the puppets only attacked this tiny dwarf town and not the big ostentatious city real nearby
[0:50:41] <%SirGO0SE> its okay Minh, I know you saved the world <3
[0:50:44] <+Mondeiya> everyone adores the WoL tho
[0:50:45] <+krispen_wa> Sin Eaters are basically watchers actually
[0:50:52] <@Solidus_113> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
[0:50:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Minh that's kinda wrong, you're a HUGE DEAL
[0:50:54] <+SunnyVarietyPack> that is you
[0:50:54] <adithehella> OOOOOH
[0:50:56] <Klefth> What are you talking about, Minh? All of the major characters in the game make a HUGE DEAL out of your character
[0:50:56] <%JenovasPuppet> It you!
[0:50:57] <+NYCrownlessKing> warrior of darkness
[0:50:57] <DatAsuna> it's you after an expansion
[0:50:58] <Goraka91> It's uh
[0:50:58] <+projectmanatees> mihn mentioned it first stream
[0:51:00] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It's a title we used on this planet
[0:51:01] <%ZweihanderSteve> its you :D
[0:51:02] <irontatsumi> Meeee!
[0:51:03] <%X2Eliah> Light = bad
[0:51:09] <ulcaban> Ozzy Osborne!
[0:51:16] <Daniel_Is_I> Woolie you asked a more complicated question than you know
[0:51:16] <indominus_corgi> if the nier stuff took out the first wouldnt that start the rejoining of the first?
[0:51:17] <%fetrigon> light bad ye
[0:51:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @krispen_wa
[0:51:26] <Klefth> That was a shit explanation LUL

[0:51:30] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yes
[0:51:30] <Applecannon63> Light is bad in this word
[0:51:31] <%andrewofbob> Bringing back some balance
[0:51:31] <%TKO552> TKO552 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! pp
[0:51:33] <+krispen_wa> One brings Shadow, One brings Light
[0:51:34] <+Tarviti> It is in the FF1 sense
[0:51:35] <whatatkins> Kappa
[0:51:36] <+SunnyVarietyPack> This planet you are on, is a different planet entirely
[0:51:36] <Goraka91> We are definitely a Warrior of Light
[0:51:39] <adithehella> You are both
[0:51:40] <+krispen_wa> Two toned echoes tumbling through time
[0:51:43] <Ahk_90> Woolie PLEASE listen
[0:51:44] <adithehella> you are totally both
[0:51:45] <@Solidus_113> in The Source you are the Warrior of Light, in The First you are the Warrior Of Darkness
[0:51:48] <+krispen_wa> Threescore wasted ten cast aside
[0:51:51] <+skylerpilot> There is also Ardbert and his crew who were the WoD in our world
[0:51:51] <Tenkay> In this World the Light element was so strong it was destroying everything else so you go here and have to bring the balance with the Dark
[0:51:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BEGONE, SPAWN OF SHADOW
[0:51:54] <%SockNinja013> The Warrior of Light and Dark both. WoLD
[0:51:54] <+Deebo305> honestly of you showed Woolie the Amh Arang cutscene he'd get it but that would also be pretty huge spoilers
[0:51:57] <%fetrigon> light is a zombie virus in this world
[0:51:58] <thatotherguynikolas> Oposite lands
[0:51:58] <+Tarviti> Light and Dark is a balance, this world has too much light so they are bad
[0:51:58] <+Mondeiya> Shadowbringers tried to decouple good and bad from light and bad basically
[0:52:00] <DatAsuna> Think of it like star wars, you're the warrior of balance.
[0:52:01] <+D00msDayDan> you are the warrior of light in the rest of the game, in shadowbringers you are the warrior of darkness
[0:52:02] <Applecannon63> Warriors of Darkness is like a FF3 deal?
[0:52:03] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Light is only bad here because there is too much of it
[0:52:05] <%Rixstarian> Minh struggles to explain it well
[0:52:06] <@mothmandraws> its hard to explain a like 200 hour story lol
[0:52:06] <%Kain5707> show Woolie Seat of Sacrfice!
[0:52:06] <+MTLxSpider> @WoolieVersus you are in an isekai in this expansion.
[0:52:08] <%Double_Tap_That> Warrior of Twilight
[0:52:08] <%LittleCinders> Warrior of Twilight!
[0:52:10] <BurnDinorex> Y'know what? I've been watching your streams for a bit, I figured I might as well type in chat for once. What's up, Wools?
[0:52:14] <+Thatghostpepper> kinda like an ult universe
[0:52:15] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus A flood of light aether destroyed 90% of the planet
[0:52:16] <valriot> Theres an excess of light to the point where there was no night
[0:52:17] <Psyramics> its not that light is bad, its that there's too much light and it almost wiped the world clean
[0:52:18] <fritz_dacat> Fear the old light Lawrance for god sakes fear it
[0:52:21] <ulcaban> In another dimension, with voyeuristic intention!
[0:52:26] <%Dapper_Cactuar> a wave of light nearly wiped out all life on this world
[0:52:26] <+skylerpilot> @LittleCinders thats Riku
[0:52:30] <+NYCrownlessKing> your a warrior of darkness here because this world questions is it darkness itself that makes you evil? @woolieversus
[0:52:32] <Klefth> It's a world whose balance is tipped so far towards light that it basically ruined 90% of it
[0:52:33] <+NYCrownlessKing> tldr
[0:52:34] <Daniel_Is_I> It's like the end of FF3. Light bad.
[0:52:34] <+dotrook> I think the seed saw that the first was almost dead and went "it's free realstate!"
[0:52:38] <+krispen_wa> DOOT DOOT DOOT
[0:52:38] <+Tarviti> Just ask Pat on the podcast
[0:52:41] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[0:52:41] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:52:42] <%illtima> This fucking GROOSE music
[0:52:45] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus not really, you're just the warrior of whichever side there isn't enough of
[0:52:46] <%fetrigon> LUL
[0:52:50] <+D00msDayDan> no minh just answered it like twice
[0:52:51] <+MTLxSpider> pat could maybe
[0:52:52] <jaysondeez> lol
[0:52:52] <+NYCrownlessKing> ya ask pat Kappa
[0:52:53] <+IxDomxI> LMAO

[0:53:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lmao

[0:53:44] <+VongolaGearX> yeah
[0:53:44] <+Tarviti> Luckily that wasn't the real arc
[0:53:51] <%X2Eliah> So the best thing is, now both Pat and Woolie will have hour long FF14 discussions on future podcasts and it's awesome
[0:53:54] <%andrewofbob> Is it me, or is the Fat Chocobo music too close to Saturday Morning Scrublords?
[0:53:56] <olaksi> if you are aligned to light you are resistant to it, so you make a good counterforce to it
[0:54:05] <+QueequegTheater> Oh poor Minh, yeah that word is rough for ESL
[0:54:12] <+krispen_wa> they misspelled "ark" as "arc" so it must be the discount copy of the ark
[0:54:12] <@mothmandraws> we could show woolie Thordan
[0:54:18] <%X2Eliah> @QueequegTheater which word?
[0:54:24] <+NYCrownlessKing> g warrior moth

[0:56:00] <+QueequegTheater> Drakenhard is on another level of "aww fuck"
[0:56:00] <%ChoculaUltra> and definitely don't throw any corpses into them
[0:56:02] <+dotrook> you cant even just destroy them. in one drakengard 1 ending, just destroying it still fucks up the world in a different way
[0:56:04] <olaksi> touch the orb
[0:56:04] <+projectmanatees> na those seeds gave us drakenguard 2 they good :)
[0:56:05] <thatotherguynikolas> Avoid the orb at all costs
[0:56:08] <%X2Eliah> Everything Drakengard is basically "your world is over"
[0:56:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> lmfao
[0:56:18] <+krispen_wa> Kugane music Kreygasm
[0:56:18] <+Arrior_Septem> lmao
[0:56:22] <+valiard> the orbs are XK class
[0:56:23] <+QueequegTheater> Oh god his HUD
[0:56:24] <+NYCrownlessKing> giant boxes
[0:56:33] <smallboops> so seeds are a nuclear metaphor huh
[0:56:34] <%andrewofbob> woolieONEGUY
[0:56:37] <%ThisIsLloyd> one big dumb singing idiot to ruin it
[0:56:48] <%dustyjordans> woolieONEGUY woolieVS 2020

[0:57:13] <Darren716> Congrats Woolie on being the number 1 FF14 streamer on twitch once again
[0:57:20] <+NYCrownlessKing> yes thank u solidus
[0:57:22] <gunstars20> Main account Pog
[0:57:40] <smallboops> BIG THONK
[0:57:41] <olaksi> so ARR stream when
[0:57:43] <halfmasks> yo
[0:57:45] <Goraka91> Into the Taroverse
[0:57:46] <Applecannon63> the protag in Drakengard is so boring and power creeping bullshit
[0:57:49] <Saltmeisterr> thonk time
[0:57:51] <+krispen_wa> Canon explanation for Seeds
[0:57:52] <CoffeeSlice> LETS GOOOO
[0:57:53] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie VS Raubahn EX
[0:57:59] <+NYCrownlessKing> so that proves its a synthesis of the original @woolieversus
[0:58:02] <+anoldtoilet> sip
[0:58:04] <jaysondeez> digital equivalent of the watchers?
[0:58:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> like its not the OG Seed
[0:58:06] <+Kalinflip> english only pendayhoe
[0:58:18] <+dotrook> "Science that is advance enough, is indistinguisable from magic"
[0:58:19] <+NYCrownlessKing> synthetic* ?
[0:58:19] <RogueMinja> Time for week 3?
[0:58:20] <+Tarviti> @WoolieVersus We know the seeds can create objects so the seed created a duplicate network
[0:58:24] <+NYCrownlessKing> yah
[0:58:25] <smallboops> cool i guessed right :V
[0:58:31] <duckyisded> Who is he talking with?
[0:58:32] <@Solidus_113> The machine network has ALL of human history, like EVERYTHING
[0:58:34] <Applecannon63> Ark has become the part of the watchers
[0:58:36] <jaysondeez> developing.synthetic magic
[0:58:38] <+QueequegTheater> @duckyisded Minh
[0:58:43] <+fugatlas> just throw some maybes on the end there and your bullshit becomes theories!
[0:58:44] <vVAstrAVv> maybe taro just writes whatever the fuck
[0:58:45] <chickenhunter> the Seeds of Destruction also have a variant that gets generated in the Nier world that might be slightly different from the Drakengard version
[0:58:45] <@Solidus_113> the 3rd raid shows they have every detail of human history
[0:58:46] <Tenkay> what Solidus said yeah
[0:58:46] <Daniel_Is_I> Didn't they come here through a portal? Like they went back through a portal at the end of the raid.
[0:58:49] <Tenkay> it knows everything
[0:58:49] <DatAsuna> Sure is handy that konnog found that out from unknown source
[0:58:52] <olaksi> not huge fan of the timeloop idea myself tbh, makes the world feel small
[0:58:54] <Tenkay> even the Angelus/Caim stuff
[0:58:55] <+Kalinflip> damn mAchine network knows how to fuck?
[0:59:04] <+krispen_wa> man, i thought nier ending D was so hopeful too, but the ark was fucked from the start
[0:59:08] <DatAsuna> they were never actually seeds of resurrection that was just a fool's hope
[0:59:10] <Goraka91> @Applecannon63 Okay but what if it's a close circle and the watchers in the first games ARE the machines from Automata
[0:59:13] <+QueequegTheater> @olaksi it's more history repeating itself than actual loops
[0:59:18] <+dom3800> I don't think the Ark landed here, the machine network here is a copy from the seed. At least thats how I read it
[0:59:20] <+QueequegTheater> Which is a thing
[0:59:33] <+Tarviti> @krispen_wa This wasn't the real ark so it should be fine
[0:59:35] <+QueequegTheater> He is indeed a poor
[0:59:39] <@mothmandraws> ive got less gil
[0:59:46] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Sooo are ya going to do this kind of followthrough for FF14's all main stories?
[0:59:46] <+projectmanatees> @mothmandraws how much
[0:59:48] <smallboops> tbh this is the alt
[0:59:48] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus did you ever find out that the Tower in Automata was the machines trying to recreate the Sleeping Beauty tree from Nier original?
[0:59:49] <+BigDumBeak> gamera!
[0:59:50] <+IxDomxI> moth, you always have no gil
[0:59:50] <Velyndra> you only have 6 million, that means you're a poor

[1:06:00] <+Thatghostpepper> a good chunk are
[1:06:01] <+KawaiiJetty> Twintania rip
[1:06:02] <+charm_quark_> famfrit best
[1:06:13] <@mothmandraws> everyone is here to raid with the actual legend mothmandraws
[1:06:15] <+NYCrownlessKing> ultros is one of many in a world server. any player in that world server can visit the other servers @woolieversus
[1:06:17] <+QueequegTheater> I'm on Malboro
[1:06:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I'm a Crystal Boi
[1:06:19] <%X2Eliah> So which server is the RP server and which is the sweaty tryhard server?
[1:06:27] <+NYCrownlessKing> but they can't visit other world servers @woolieversus yet
[1:06:28] <@mothmandraws> balmung is rp server
[1:06:35] <%Kain5707> Excal is a good place
[1:06:37] <@mothmandraws> think giglamesh is raid try hard
[1:06:44] <@Solidus_113> general content progression
[1:06:46] <+krispen_wa> @klefth did she NEVER wear that color? and did she question whether something was ice?
[1:06:48] <%Rixstarian> @klefth Gavomit. The normal fight is so cringe as well w/ the memory defense, too. Good idea, just bad subject matter
[1:06:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is exodus an ok place for casual?
[1:06:54] <+KawaiiJetty> isn't Crystal the meme one
[1:06:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Brynhildr is a cool place
[1:07:01] <%JenovasPuppet> If you can do these Nier weeklies, you've pretty much done everything.
[1:07:01] <+QueequegTheater> Minh show him your job levels
[1:07:03] <Daniel_Is_I> Just the main quest
[1:07:04] <%LittleCinders> Formally from Balmung. that's right Pat! Degenerate roleplayers are people too! @patstaresat
[1:07:05] <+MTLxSpider> @cobalt_phoenix_ im there. its cool. :)
[1:07:05] <olaksi> most FF14 rp i see is just typing "uwu" too many times
[1:07:05] <%Harthhammer> crystal gang
[1:07:06] <jaysondeez> no
[1:07:06] <@Solidus_113> you have to do the main story
[1:07:07] <%Kain5707> exodus is pretty chill
[1:07:09] <+fugatlas> i high key want minh to flash us that job level chart in the inventory screen
[1:07:10] <VizualBlitz> @cobalt_phoenix_ yea super chill
[1:07:11] <+SShen> Crystals the NA meme one yeah, all of the EU servers are memes cause nobodyd o content
[1:07:11] <jaysondeez> just msq
[1:07:12] <DatAsuna> No but you have to do a lot
[1:07:12] <+NYCrownlessKing> you complete story content @woolieversus
[1:07:14] <nobody287> nier you have to beat 5.0
[1:07:20] <Zeif00> just msq/main story
[1:07:21] <@mothmandraws> this is catch up content actually, to gear up ppl who are behind
[1:07:23] <%X2Eliah> yeah, so, "main quests"
[1:07:23] <+krispen_wa> 600 hours to get to Nier
[1:07:25] <+seoliart> There's also an ilvl requirement per raid
[1:07:30] <+VongolaGearX> also have a high item level
[1:07:30] <Klefth> @Rixstarian Would've been so much better if they'd just given her a THICK valley girl accent
[1:07:31] <%SilverDevilfish> "Got drugs"
[1:07:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok cool, i went with that one and wasn't sure if it was a good choice or not, glad to hear it
[1:07:33] <+Thatghostpepper> ultros/exodus are pretty chill
[1:07:37] <+ThreeStrikes_> Hi Hello I just finished the Main Story, not the post patch stuff - It took 250 hours Woolie
[1:07:44] <%JenovasPuppet> Woolie contemplating getting a job to 80 :D
[1:07:45] <+ThreeStrikes_> 250 HOURS
[1:07:53] <gunstars20> What's the recommended casual world
[1:07:54] <+QueequegTheater> I like Gaia
[1:08:02] <%guyalex> it's also THE FUCKING WORST
[1:08:03] <+Thatghostpepper> it gave it closure
[1:08:05] <+MTLxSpider> if you are brezilian you go to behemoth Kappa
[1:08:10] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus If you're interested, you might want to play an off-tank
[1:08:11] <+Arrior_Septem> its meta to tactics
[1:08:19] <+Kyma1020> Connected to Tactics but World Building to 14
[1:08:20] <@mothmandraws> gunstars I say any primal server is good for casual
[1:08:22] <+krispen_wa> @gunstars20 crystal is known for casual
[1:08:23] <%LittleCinders> @gunstars20 Leviathan isn't bad!
[1:08:25] <+SShen> Skull got to endgame from scratch in 2weeks
[1:08:27] <+fugatlas> the tactics/FF12 raid doesn't really add much to the story, it just kinda makes everything feel more cozy
[1:08:31] <%Rixstarian> @klefth Should've made her Ascian name something like Nicole, or some other stereotypical Jersey name
[1:08:31] <@mothmandraws> its not try hard but also will beat content
[1:08:34] <+ApocalypticExpress> The Ivalice Raids are great
[1:08:35] <%guyalex> only the last couple lines are any good, the test of the dialogue is so awful
[1:08:41] <%thetunnelhomer> I'm stuck in Crystal pls help
[1:08:42] <Dodolo212> Leviathan gang
[1:08:44] <+MTLxSpider> Yes
[1:08:46] <+ApocalypticExpress> Both
[1:08:46] <%Rixstarian> BOTH
[1:08:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yes
[1:08:47] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Fran is in it
[1:08:50] <+MTLxSpider> 12+ tactics
[1:08:51] <rei0> tactics and 12 both
[1:08:52] <%ZweihanderSteve> more tactics than xii
[1:08:55] <%fetrigon> both
[1:08:55] <Klefth> @Rixstarian MINE WAS THE SEAT OF SARAH
[1:08:57] <afronooch> both
[1:08:59] <+MTLxSpider> Fran is in. she hot
[1:09:03] <olaksi> the FF12 raid changes the events drastically, including in what order the ivalice games take place
[1:09:05] <+PMAvers> Hey, if you havn't done it before, no time like the present.
[1:09:05] <+fugatlas> they added the judge armor last patch and that shit is HARD to get
[1:09:06] <%JenovasPuppet> It's more a 12 world, but there's a lot of Tactics lore.
[1:09:10] <+VongolaGearX> would make another cool series
[1:09:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You can actually get Judge gear too!
[1:09:11] <Sydin18> Judge Armor in the game finally
[1:09:15] <@mothmandraws> @WoolieVersus basically a version of ivalice happened in this world, with slightly different ending
[1:09:15] <%X2Eliah> It's really messed up that the alien ship is accessed from the bunker
[1:09:17] <+krispen_wa> Fran is meaningless when every other character on limsa is a bunny
[1:09:18] <%Javaa01> Well, orange
[1:09:18] <shinji_ifrit> you can also get judge armor now
[1:09:19] <%fetrigon> LUL
[1:09:19] <%Javaa01> But ye
[1:09:20] <%illtima> SAME MINH
[1:09:26] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It is a sequel to Tactics but it's not technically canon, it's an alternate universe version where the Tactics story happened offscreen in XIV
[1:09:29] <Srthunda> just blends in?
[1:09:32] <+fugatlas> woolie callin minh on johns
[1:09:34] <%illtima> when I played FFXIV I was barely able to notice those circles
[1:09:35] <%X2Eliah> The map is reddish
[1:09:47] <+QueequegTheater> The map is beige the circle is orange
[1:09:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[1:09:48] <@mothmandraws> woolie do you know difference between larboard and starboard
[1:09:49] <%JenovasPuppet> Are there not color blind options in XIV?
[1:09:53] <+Thatghostpepper> wait is mihn orange colorblind?
[1:10:01] <+MTLxSpider> oh right
[1:10:02] <@mothmandraws> not on console
[1:10:03] <+OblivionSword1> colorblinnd is wild
[1:10:03] <%Rixstarian> You can increase your map opacity
[1:10:10] <+QueequegTheater> Deuteranopia
[1:10:16] <%X2Eliah> @Thatghostpepper Deuter-something
[1:10:23] <@mothmandraws> due to jank code they cant get colour blind working right in ff14
[1:10:24] <DatAsuna> That's the most common type iirc
[1:10:27] <+krispen_wa> MONKE
[1:10:27] <@mothmandraws> its mostly a filter
[1:10:29] <+vdalson> @mothmandraws i liked your sorrow of werlyt art
[1:10:30] <+MTLxSpider> never knew. thats cool
[1:10:39] <%Skullgod> @JenovasPuppet the colorblind options in this game are just an overlay so consoles dont have it because they don't have that kind of technology
[1:10:40] <%X2Eliah> Deuteranopia is a type of red-green color blindness characterized by the inability to distinguish red and green pigments.
[1:10:47] <+Dangerlocker> monke
[1:10:47] <+ApocalypticExpress> they need to rehaul the jank ffxiv code
[1:10:48] <+Thatghostpepper> we learn something new today

[1:13:10] <+PMAvers> In the Dwarf weekly quests they're working on getting people more colors to tell them apart easier.
[1:13:11] <Ks201> the other village has another look entirly

[1:14:25] <+NYCrownlessKing> they hacked orb maybe
[1:14:26] <DatAsuna> Ending E isn't to do with the ark
[1:14:27] <+Tarviti> But we know that wasn't the real network
[1:14:28] <+dom3800> The machines fucked off because they'd learnt all they wanted
[1:14:31] <DatAsuna> @cobalt_phoenix_ no
[1:14:35] <+dom3800> not from any change of heart
[1:14:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DatAsuna ah thanks
[1:14:44] <+Rafraud> And nothing of value was learned
[1:14:44] <%X2Eliah> Ending E feels like one of those off-shoot / dead-end branches

[1:17:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do these seeds pop up out of nowhere or does something need to happen for them to appear?
[1:18:03] <+krispen_wa> I'm pretty sure the helms are all from Heavensturn
[1:18:09] <+NYCrownlessKing> read the notes tho woolz Kappa
[1:18:10] <VidulaSaix> It's a bit confusing because the implication is that the seed created all of this Nier related stuff in the FF world but if that's the case then why is there a destroyed bunker. Even if it didn't the destroyed bunker makes no sense to me
[1:18:20] <%X2Eliah> @cobalt_phoenix_ Something about breaking the seals of the world?

[1:32:16] <+MTLxSpider> mh hm
[1:32:24] <Louie_Salmon> Man the FF talk really is in one ear out the other
[1:32:35] <VidulaSaix> A tiny bit of FF lore to tie in with the seed, the seeds seemingly appear when a world is on the brink of desctruction which in this expansion the First was
[1:32:36] <Applecannon63> So another form of evolution of the machines
[1:33:00] <%JenovasPuppet> That isn't even proper sized.
[1:33:01] <+DreyfussFrost> Cat boys are still smaller than the human analogues.
[1:33:04] <%JenovasPuppet> Mancat manlet
[1:33:11] <Space_Pagan> Catboy too small
[1:33:13] <Klefth> That's a catboy, though. Catboys are smaller than a regular human or the other races
[1:33:16] <%call_me_comic> i would be fine with those proportions for furniture
[1:33:16] <+vdalson> thats a yaoi manga bed
[1:33:41] <+ChrisAlgoo> big beds, big hands
[1:33:49] <+krispen_wa> So who would win, a Queen Beast or Emet-Selch
[1:33:59] <+BloodyBurney> longing might also be from to the white orb
[1:34:03] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[1:34:05] <%andrewofbob> You can seat a lallafel on a hrothgar's chair; other way around, not so much
[1:34:32] <VidulaSaix> Mother Angel is Queen Beast
[1:34:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> ya
[1:34:36] <smallboops> mother angle is ending E queen beast
[1:34:45] <Space_Pagan> Queen-beast?
[1:34:55] <Applecannon63> queen beast
[1:35:00] <+valiard> stop second impact before it happens
[1:35:01] <+krispen_wa> Beast-queen
[1:35:15] <smallboops> basically the god that made all the seeds
[1:35:21] <%Kain5707> based queen
[1:35:35] <@Solidus_113> that is angelic
[1:35:41] <+krispen_wa> when is the drakengard raid series. i want my Zero glam
[1:35:56] <+QueequegTheater> So the Queen Beast shows up, but has the bad luck of birthing next to a freaking Final Fantasy protagonist so it gets clapped
[1:36:01] <+BloodyBurney> are data-mines open for discussion?
[1:36:07] <Goraka91> No
[1:36:07] <+QueequegTheater> @BloodyBurney no
[1:36:08] <%Kain5707> no
[1:36:10] <+BloodyBurney> kk
[1:36:12] <+Arnschen> Nope
[1:36:13] <VidulaSaix> A big difference here is that instead of a dead body gonig inside like Furiae did, it birthed a clone
[1:36:13] <Klefth> No
[1:36:15] <DatAsuna> no
[1:36:15] <%Kain5707> TOS monkaS
[1:36:16] <smallboops> yeah they didnt
[1:36:17] <+Kyma1020> Yes it did
[1:36:19] <VidulaSaix> It did
[1:36:20] <smallboops> furiae just got melted in
[1:36:21] <chickenhunter> It did
[1:36:22] <+blue_cloak552> Yes they did
[1:36:25] <+KisukeOboro> What twitter thread is this?
[1:36:26] <Saltmeisterr> it did
[1:36:26] <@Solidus_113> that textbox gibberish probably exists as it does because they weren't going to add a whole new font just for this raid
[1:36:28] <VidulaSaix> It appeared when Furiae was put in
[1:36:31] <chickenhunter> It did but not in that font
[1:36:40] <chickenhunter> same "alphabet" tho
[1:36:58] <+QueequegTheater> It doesn't go well
[1:36:59] <DatAsuna> annog probably fell in
[1:37:00] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @blue_cloak552
[1:37:00] <Space_Pagan> beware of orb
[1:37:01] <+projectmanatees> furiae was impure
[1:37:05] <DatAsuna> same thing
[1:37:05] <smallboops> oh crap it totally did
[1:37:08] <VidulaSaix> The big difference here is that instead of a dead body going inside like Furiae did, it birthed a clone
[1:37:08] <+krispen_wa> put your seed in the dead sister
[1:37:08] <roarofdamnation> Woolie says Alabama
[1:37:14] <%SirGO0SE> same difference KKona
[1:37:16] <Blank9> don't have sex with your dead girlfriend on the back of a dragon, and then put her in the orb
[1:37:17] <%X2Eliah> GF, sister, it's a jrpg, same thing
[1:37:25] <Blank9> that makes a bad sequel
[1:37:28] <%ZweihanderSteve> furiae would LOVE to be caims girlfriend SeemsGood
[1:37:39] <+QueequegTheater> Poor Anogg didn't even actually touch it, she fell onto it
[1:37:44] <smallboops> i wonder if its related to intonation
[1:37:49] <smallboops> or zero's thing
[1:37:49] <%gatorafan> @blank9 and the kid born of it has issues to say the least daedra1LaughingTibs
[1:37:52] <VidulaSaix> Machines hae no need for dick
[1:37:55] <%SirGO0SE> ken doll Kreygasm
[1:37:58] <@Solidus_113> and this is where it gets crazy
[1:38:03] <smallboops> laynaWAH
[1:38:07] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:38:08] <%Lion_kun> SEX USELESS
[1:38:11] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:38:16] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[1:38:19] <+QueequegTheater> I have no dick and I must cum
[1:38:22] <%X2Eliah> "The Aliens were more like plants"
[1:38:22] <+Arnschen> The real failure
[1:38:25] <%andrewofbob> Electrochemistry 0
[1:38:25] <asakura_ayase> I knew we forgot something
[1:38:26] <%SirGO0SE> @QueequegTheater LUL
[1:38:30] <Dragon_Batman> "I have no diiiiiiiiiiiiick"
[1:38:33] <Space_Pagan> Do machines dream of electric junk?
[1:38:35] <DatAsuna> put both
[1:38:39] <Tracazoid> The robots wanted to have sex but even when making a more human robot forgot an essential part
[1:38:46] <%JenovasPuppet> There's literally a scene of the machines clank clank clanking because they have no junk
[1:38:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[1:38:52] <%CourtOfFamine> I have no dick and I must scream
[1:38:57] <Applecannon63> Yet those aliens look like dicks
[1:39:11] <VidulaSaix> You're not even halfway into it LUL
[1:40:02] <Goraka91> Is it a breach in paradigm, or is the paradigm to breach
[1:40:36] <pmtriox> why are we going through a twitter thread instead of just watching it?
[1:40:38] <+QueequegTheater> Echo, don't got to explain shit
[1:40:53] <VidulaSaix> We already did watch it
[1:40:55] <+QueequegTheater> @pmtriox it's not cutscenes, it's compiled information from the raids
[1:40:59] <+PMAvers> I mean the echo is a universal translator. I guess it can just translate thought into machine code now?
[1:41:00] <Cubblesv2> @pmtriox Because they went through it on Wednesday
[1:41:24] <%czeekytv> @PMAvers fuck it, good enough for me lol
[1:41:39] <@Solidus_113> the machine network has all of human history
[1:41:43] <@Solidus_113> EVERYTHING
[1:42:04] <VidulaSaix> Everything recorded anyway
[1:42:13] <rosemon5001> @Solidus_113 all that porn ohhh myyyyy
[1:42:14] <+QueequegTheater> Even my porn preferences?
[1:42:21] <Goraka91> Especially
[1:42:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> it knows ur into feet
[1:42:33] <Kenyuki4> yes, they know that more then anything
[1:42:36] <+vdalson> does that mean the machine network even has the missing crymetime videos
[1:42:43] <+QueequegTheater> Feet is fucking vanilla compared to the shit I'm into
[1:42:44] <DatAsuna> "here's how they're different" "absolutely the same"
[1:42:53] <%Juriasu> why Taro, why must you splooge your story all over the place
[1:42:59] <+QueequegTheater> But I am also into feet
[1:43:02] <asakura_ayase> It always struck me as odd that Yohna and Yorha are so similar, like the same word passed down through generations.
[1:43:07] <+QueequegTheater> Hey Juri Han
[1:43:20] <@Solidus_113> N2 is red girls
[1:43:24] <+DreyfussFrost> Red Girl
[1:43:24] <VidulaSaix> N2 is Red Girl
[1:43:25] <Goraka91> N2 red girl
[1:43:28] <BluBox> Red girl
[1:43:28] <alrobot2014> we're lucky we never ran into a machine colony that was into ryona
[1:43:30] <+Arnschen> Ye
[1:43:31] <%X2Eliah> N2 the red grill
[1:43:33] <+Kyma1020> Yes
[1:43:37] <roarofdamnation> Uhum
[1:43:47] <smallboops> her name was N2??
[1:43:53] <+ApocalypticExpress> Network 2
[1:43:56] <%X2Eliah> That's how she introduced herself
[1:44:00] <%X2Eliah> themselves
[1:44:00] <%Kain5707> Nier 2 :)
[1:44:05] <smallboops> she introduced herself????
[1:44:09] <+MTLxSpider> she should have been called 5G
[1:44:11] <+charp35> Where is this screenshot even from? iI dont remember it
[1:44:14] <Applecannon63> Red Girl also known as Manna look-alike from Drakengard
[1:44:18] <smallboops> all i remember was her talking mad shit
[1:44:19] <%X2Eliah> Automata
[1:44:20] <2DSuperiority> yay Jackass
[1:44:23] <VidulaSaix> This concept Eve art is fucking rad. I'm annoyed it was cut
[1:44:25] <Dragon_Batman> This Jackass ye
[1:44:26] <+RealPT1> hey Jackass
[1:44:28] <VidulaSaix> Jackass
[1:44:29] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> That was written by Jackass, wasn't it?
[1:44:32] <HollowMan190> thanks Jackass
[1:44:32] <+PA_Raiden333> It's Jackass!
[1:44:37] <roarofdamnation> And that's Automata
[1:44:38] <+DreyfussFrost> It's Jackass's final log from post Ending C/D
[1:44:39] <+pectusumbra> I believe that's end end end of the game jackass
[1:44:40] <smallboops> chat is being very rude rn
[1:44:44] <Louie_Salmon> From automata I think yeah
[1:44:51] <+SunnyVarietyPack> jackass armor is in raid 3 btw
[1:44:52] <%Kain5707> smallboops LUL
[1:44:52] <Dragon_Batman> After you get ending c or d you have to get back in the game to read that new archive
[1:44:55] <%X2Eliah> Text and screenshot
[1:44:55] <+NYCrownlessKing> why yall making fun of o
[1:44:58] <+NYCrownlessKing> pat
[1:45:02] <adithehella> so they really couldve won at any time?
[1:45:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[1:45:06] <VidulaSaix> I love this concept
[1:45:09] <Goraka91> YO
[1:45:13] <+Arnschen> Yeyeye
[1:45:14] <smallboops> OH
[1:45:15] <%ZweihanderSteve> oh cool
[1:45:16] <%Kain5707> OH
[1:45:18] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that concept art is very interesting
[1:45:19] <%X2Eliah> OH
[1:45:19] <smallboops> I NEVER NOTICED THAT
[1:45:19] <Kenyuki4> Holy hell
[1:45:20] <Saltmeisterr> SICK
[1:45:21] <%X2Eliah> OHHHHH
[1:45:22] <+QueequegTheater> HMMMM
[1:45:22] <smallboops> that super cool
[1:45:24] <BlackermanZX> Oooooh
[1:45:26] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh that is neat
[1:45:26] <+charp35> Didnt know that, that's really cool
[1:45:29] <+krispen_wa> WHOOOAAA
[1:45:30] <%X2Eliah> Yeah they fucked up in not showing that
[1:45:30] <smallboops> laynaWAH laynaWAH laynaWAH
[1:45:31] <VidulaSaix> Its WAY better than what we got
[1:45:38] <Goraka91> He even dies like Shadowlord...huh
[1:45:42] <Applecannon63> EVE WAS GONNA BE A SHADOW LORD!?
[1:45:42] <Klefth> I wish they had
[1:45:43] <DatAsuna> probably time/budget
[1:45:44] <Louie_Salmon> A little too overt, I guess
[1:45:47] <+Kyma1020> Too obvious?
[1:45:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:45:50] <+DreyfussFrost> They already copied enough from Gestalt/Replicant.
[1:45:50] <+krispen_wa> Eve was one of the least memorable bosses and we coulda gotten THAT
[1:45:53] <smallboops> so the machine lifeforms really were trying to remake the gestalt project?
[1:45:56] <+QueequegTheater> They went with Watcher tattoos cancelling into blackface
[1:45:56] <roarofdamnation> Because anime girl is more fanservice
[1:46:06] <Dragon_Batman> I wonder that's why they did the red and black skin thing but changed it up a bit yea
[1:46:25] <Applecannon63> Eve's only reference is the tattoos referencing Drakengard 3
[1:46:35] <DatAsuna> Well they're also a completely different Devola and Popola
[1:46:39] <smallboops> he does do the zero scream i guess
[1:46:47] <DatAsuna> Like the entire point of their Automata sotyr is that it WASN'T them
[1:46:52] <DatAsuna> but they got blamed anyway
[1:47:07] <+krispen_wa> its weird seeing people saying that devola and popola were their favorite characters without playing OG Nier
[1:47:12] <DatAsuna> It wasn't in between
[1:47:15] <@Solidus_113> this tweet part is a massive stretch @WoolieVersus
[1:47:18] <DatAsuna> Different devo popo
[1:47:19] <Dragon_Batman> It's like wait why are they there type of moment
[1:47:21] <+Arnschen> Yeah, those are just two random ones
[1:47:25] <%X2Eliah> @krispen_wa Their story does stand on its own without having played Nier
[1:47:29] <+DreyfussFrost> Too much history imo. I feel bad for people who play them reversed. Doesn't detract a ton from Automata, but going into Replicant with no idea you've already been spoiled is rough.
[1:47:41] <adithehella> i think minh saying that the twins ddint hold significance for him bc he didn play the first one?
[1:47:44] <Goraka91> Yes
[1:47:48] <chickenhunter> Ending E is hard canon
[1:47:51] <+Arnschen> ^
[1:47:52] <%gatorafan> reminder: this thread is a fan theory
[1:47:54] <VidulaSaix> Its not just ending E. Its what the Forest of Myth is in general
[1:47:55] <Cubblesv2> T H E B A B Y
[1:47:55] <+Kyma1020> Yes
[1:47:59] <Goraka91> THE BABY
[1:48:03] <+RealPT1> that's also where you do the novel bits
[1:48:06] <Saltmeisterr> Even more canon with replicant remake
[1:48:07] <DatAsuna> babbie nier
[1:48:10] <DatAsuna> and necrophillia
[1:48:12] <+dom3800> the forest has always been a computer
[1:48:12] <+krispen_wa> @x2eliah does it though? they show up like once, then appear at the tower, then die as youre forcefed their backstory
[1:48:14] <HollowMan190> together again
[1:48:22] <VidulaSaix> @Saltmeisterr Shut up
[1:48:25] <@Solidus_113> this is from a Q&A from the Automata strategy guide
[1:48:31] <%KiwamiKiryu> and necropihila
[1:48:33] <%X2Eliah> @krispen_wa "forcefed" you have the wrong mindset for it, man
[1:48:44] <VidulaSaix> :)
[1:48:48] <Dragon_Batman> I mean every ending has some canon so it fits
[1:48:49] <%Rixstarian> @krispen_wa You don't have to read their memories
[1:48:49] <+KiwamiKiryu> don't forget the necrophilia
[1:48:56] <Goraka91> Kaine fucking that corpse was very important guys
[1:48:58] <+Arnschen> Well the tree was still the tree outside of Ending E tho
[1:49:02] <Saltmeisterr> @VidulaSaix sry my b :)
[1:49:05] <%X2Eliah> what was her name
[1:49:06] <VidulaSaix> Possibly
[1:49:11] <+D00msDayDan> no idea who that human could be
[1:49:22] <Blank9> kaine jerking off in a tree while someone told her to knock it off was also very important
[1:49:28] <Dragon_Batman> It would have to be based off mana yea but who knows
[1:49:34] <%ThisIsLloyd> it would have to be right? like who else
[1:49:35] <Kenyuki4> OR 1?
[1:49:37] <+Arnschen> Or One
[1:49:37] <+QueequegTheater> I bet it was Leonard, that's why N2 is a little girl Kappa
[1:49:39] <+RealPT1> but she didn't make it to real world
[1:49:39] <+krispen_wa> N2 was obviously based on Yukiko
[1:49:42] <VidulaSaix> Very similar design to Mannah and she was used as a vessel for the Watchers
[1:49:44] <+doomunderthestairs> what about zero
[1:49:54] <Dragon_Batman> Yea 1 as well, cuz Mana and 1 have big similarites
[1:50:04] <@Solidus_113> Brother One specifically
[1:50:13] <@Solidus_113> because he forms the cult of the watchers
[1:50:23] <smallboops> the forest was neat but it kinda sucked lol
[1:50:25] <VidulaSaix> The tree is rad. I dont understand the hate for it
[1:50:26] <%KiwamiKiryu> Legit question chat, is Drakengard 2 ever relevant?
[1:50:33] <jorniev> what is this stream about?
[1:50:36] <Kenyuki4> No
[1:50:37] <%ThisIsLloyd> drakengard 2 does not
[1:50:43] <%X2Eliah> @jorniev fanfic
[1:50:47] <DatAsuna> A lot
[1:50:48] <Goraka91> A lot of shit
[1:50:48] <+krispen_wa> Drakengard 2 is the DMC2
[1:50:50] <jorniev> ok
[1:50:51] <+MTLxSpider> fanfic nier raid theory
[1:50:51] <2DSuperiority> Drakengard 2 might as well be a void
[1:50:57] <DatAsuna> In ending A ONe makes the cult of the watchers
[1:50:59] <DatAsuna> from drakengard 1
[1:51:00] <Kenyuki4> Drakengard 3 may aswell be fanfic
[1:51:01] <+Arnschen> Brother One survives in one ending and makes the watcher cult ye
[1:51:08] <+Kyma1020> Creates the Watcher Cult
[1:51:08] <jorniev> drakengard 3 is about the flower
[1:51:08] <Applecannon63> Drakengard is not memorable except for Caim x Angelus
[1:51:09] <Tracazoid> The brother appears and stabs Zero in an ending, going off to make the Cult of the Watchers
[1:51:10] <+Arnschen> Oh yeah, the manga with the Elf
[1:51:10] <jaysondeez> brother one starts cult of watchers
[1:51:11] <DatAsuna> He starts drakengard 1
[1:51:11] <VidulaSaix> It depends which ending you want to consider canon from 3
[1:51:13] <+OranHexthief> brother one sup[posedly starts cult of the watchers
[1:51:19] <2DSuperiority> Drakengard 3 Brother One manga is SOME SHIT
[1:51:22] <%KiwamiKiryu> gotcha, yeah I saw Clemps video but technically seems like both Drakengard 2 are 3 are barely worth it
[1:51:25] <chickenhunter> the problem is that we dont know for sure if the Forest of Myth has Drakengard lore incorporated into it since its an Earth creation
[1:51:33] <+krispen_wa> brother one totally eats shit at the end

[1:51:34] <Applecannon63> *drakengard2
[1:51:38] <DatAsuna> The manga is full of rape and murder, it's very edgey
[1:51:41] <VidulaSaix> @chickenhunter It explicitly does because it talks about Angelus
[1:51:46] <BluBox> Caim's wacky adventures
[1:51:48] <DedlokPM> @jorniev ff14 nier stuff, which is now complete as much as they can do on stream now so they are reading a theory thread on the FF14 Nier stuff and how it connects to nier and/or drakengard
[1:51:48] <+Arnschen> Verrrry edgy
[1:51:50] <%ZweihanderSteve> its half the fun!!
[1:51:55] <%gatorafan> maybe it's red eye Kappa
[1:51:59] <%X2Eliah> @DatAsuna That's how you know it's a real manga
[1:52:03] <chickenhunter> @VidulaSaix it talks about The Dragon entering the world but never anything before that
[1:52:06] <+krispen_wa> @datasuna i mean, drakengard 1 was full on edge anyways
[1:52:21] <jorniev> GET CLEMPS IN HERE
[1:52:22] <VidulaSaix> Its a lot of cool shit if you're deep in there
[1:52:24] <Applecannon63> Drakengard 1 is daring
[1:52:36] <+senfood> @chickenhunter But we do know that Drakengard influences the Forest of Myth because the data includes the particales that came from Caim and Angelus' bodies.
[1:52:50] <+krispen_wa> remember when one of your most loyal companions was a pedophile in drakengard 1
[1:52:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:52:54] <%pyrojack6> Her Nflorescense
[1:52:56] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:52:59] <+Arnschen> I'm pretty sure Clemps is already poring over the texts to make a video lol
[1:53:11] <jorniev> so spheres in the sky are the seeds of destruction?
[1:53:13] <Dragon_Batman> LUL memory is the biggest enemy
[1:53:21] <Dragon_Batman> But can't fault you tho
[1:53:27] <%Irridium> they say memory's the second thing to go
[1:53:35] <emeraldskrull> woolieTRASH_SG woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[1:53:35] <chickenhunter> @senfood yea that is why the symbology and magic has those roots but thats different from it containing the totality of drakengard history
[1:53:49] <+senfood> That's true.
[1:53:52] <Blank9> drakengard 3 was so much nothing
[1:53:53] <jorniev> THE FLOWER
[1:53:57] <+Arnschen> Drakengard 3 had some really interesting moments
[1:54:06] <jorniev> ITS TRUE
[1:54:06] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:54:06] <%gatorafan> Good ol IV
[1:54:10] <Goraka91> Don't forget the old man
[1:54:11] <VidulaSaix> Whenever going into anything new Yoko Taro, it's highly recommended to rewatch Clemps' videos LUL
[1:54:12] <+krispen_wa> drakengard 3 was fun, story-wise
[1:54:13] <%ChoculaUltra> some of those cutscene-to-boss-fight musical transitions from Drakengard 3 are burned into my brain
[1:54:14] <%ThisIsLloyd> yyyeaaaaah that does be canon huh
[1:54:15] <Dragon_Batman> Yea shit's everywhere
[1:54:16] <Tracazoid> Drakengard 3 has a lot of sexual energy going on
[1:54:18] <%Irridium> I wish Drakenguard 3 was on console that could give it an actual framerate
[1:54:20] <@Solidus_113> Drakengard 3 also has a busted city that randomly teleports in out of nowhere, and it looks like Nier tokyo
[1:54:20] <jaysondeez> intoners have to fuck
[1:54:21] <+blue_cloak552> @woolieversus And the boys were pigeons
[1:54:22] <HollowMan190> yeah great game
[1:54:23] <%X2Eliah> @jorniev One of the drakngards showed the sphere's landing from air en masse
[1:54:23] <Kenyuki4> Zero was horny don't judge her
[1:54:23] <VidulaSaix> Two tho FeelsBadMan
[1:54:25] <+skylerpilot> remembering Drakken Guard is best left to Clemps
[1:54:27] <%pyrojack6> TIME TRAVEL
[1:54:28] <%ZweihanderSteve> NO
[1:54:29] <DatAsuna> loosely
[1:54:29] <VidulaSaix> 2 is the shit child
[1:54:32] <Dragon_Batman> Not 2 for shure
[1:54:32] <Goraka91> 1 and 3
[1:54:33] <@Solidus_113> 3rd is the first in the timeline
[1:54:34] <+Arnschen> Also, Drakengard 3 had great diegetic music moments
[1:54:36] <DatAsuna> is connected
[1:54:39] <+blue_cloak552> 3 into 1 into neir
[1:54:39] <+Kyma1020> 2 is not connected
[1:54:40] <Goraka91> 2 is Dark Souls 2
[1:54:46] <DatAsuna> You can deny it all you want but 2 counts
[1:54:46] <Applecannon63> servants are the equivalent of magic familars
[1:54:46] <%Javaa01> 2 is Drakengard in name only, not plot
[1:54:49] <VidulaSaix> 2 is basically dark souls 2 yeah
[1:54:49] <DedlokPM> Drakengard is essentially a prequel
[1:54:54] <%ZweihanderSteve> 2 wasn't directed nor written by Yoko taro
[1:54:55] <Klefth> What's 2?
[1:54:59] <+Kyma1020> But 1,3 and everything Nier are all connected
[1:55:01] <+krispen_wa> @vidulasaix thats an insult to dark souls 2
[1:55:05] <+senfood> It definitely seems like the Cathedral City from Drakengard is some version of Tokyo.
[1:55:05] <DatAsuna> 2 is basically new boy vs kaim
[1:55:06] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:55:08] <Tracazoid> 2 is a very different game in tone from 1 and 3, from a different director. 2 makes the world seem a lot more standard fantasy than 1 or 3.
[1:55:18] <jorniev> ACCORD
[1:55:20] <Dragon_Batman> Just a name drop yea
[1:55:20] <+Arnschen> They refer to her but she never shows up
[1:55:21] <%X2Eliah> just a text reference
[1:55:23] <Blank9> accord sucks
[1:55:23] <VidulaSaix> Accord never physically appears anywhere except 3
[1:55:25] <@Solidus_113> she's an android too
[1:55:29] <%ZweihanderSteve> only cool part about drakengard 2 is that time kills death
[1:55:29] <+senfood> Accord is awesome.
[1:55:31] <smallboops> fuckin sliders man
[1:55:32] <Tenkay> I wish Accord showed up in 14
[1:55:34] <+krispen_wa> Woolie's obssession with Accord will never end
[1:55:39] <Goraka91> Accord for Drakengard 4
[1:55:40] <Klefth> She's an android series
[1:55:44] <cosmov06> Female Gman
[1:55:44] <VidulaSaix> She's basically canonicall tying to find the best "endings"
[1:55:44] <+Arnschen> I believe they say she's an android specifically
[1:55:47] <+krispen_wa> Woolie would LOVE Zelretch if he ever got into the Nasuverse
[1:55:47] <BluBox> Accord is cool
[1:55:53] <+senfood> Accord's job is to "observe singularities"
[1:55:55] <Blank9> she's a shitty god character that gropes zero for jokes and deus ex machina, that;s it
[1:55:56] <Kenyuki4> Accord needs to come back, but knowing Taro she won't
[1:55:58] <VidulaSaix> @Arnschen I mean you see one of her explode into parts so yeah LUL
[1:55:59] <%ThisIsLloyd> Accord is awesome! like the most interesting thing from drakengard 3 into nier
[1:55:59] <%X2Eliah> All these games are somehow connected in the DrakeNieR multiverse
[1:55:59] <@Solidus_113> he is LUL
[1:56:01] <chickenhunter> an Accord reference is added into Replicant
[1:56:03] <+blue_cloak552> Accord hangs out in the night side of the plannet
[1:56:07] <Goraka91> Shit Square Enix!
[1:56:07] <%gatorafan> was Kappa
[1:56:09] <Applecannon63> Accord will be canon
[1:56:31] <+senfood> Accord is already canon. She sells weapons to the vendor in Automata.
[1:56:38] <+QueequegTheater> Man, Ending D of DG1 is so goddamn depressing
[1:56:47] <jorniev> FLIYNG BABIES
[1:56:54] <+krispen_wa> accord is Yoko Taro's real form
[1:57:02] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh yea
[1:57:15] <%gatorafan> 🦀
[1:57:19] <jorniev> drakengard 1 ENDING E: craziest shit ever
[1:57:20] <+Arnschen> One of the best moments in 3 is Phanuel's first summoning
[1:57:21] <Psyramics> hope they release Drakengard 3 on a platform where it can be an actual video game and not a slideshow
[1:57:25] <VidulaSaix> Two FeelsBadMan
[1:57:34] <Blank9> it's still not a good game
[1:57:40] <jorniev> TWO is my favorite
[1:57:53] <+krispen_wa> drakengard 3's music is top tier kino
[1:57:57] <@Solidus_113> it's so good
[1:57:59] <VidulaSaix> tl;dr her backstory mindbroke her because child orb
[1:57:59] <%ThisIsLloyd> she went crazy after her orphans died
[1:58:00] <+Kyma1020> Dead Babies Woolie
[1:58:02] <jorniev> we never actually see the sky do we?
[1:58:05] <%radregice> how can you forget TWO
[1:58:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so do you need to play drakengard 1-3 to really get everything or do you only need 3 and then nier?
[1:58:20] <Applecannon63> Two's DLC story is sadness
[1:58:22] <+krispen_wa> @cobalt_phoenix_ you need 1 and 3
[1:58:25] <jorniev> SHE WENT COCOO BANANAS
[1:58:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what about 2
[1:58:31] <VidulaSaix> Likely
[1:58:38] <+Arnschen> @cobalt_phoenix_ 2 is it's own thing
[1:58:42] <jorniev> agelic writing
[1:58:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ah ok
[1:58:42] <%ThisIsLloyd> just watch clemps videos on drakengard it's easier
[1:58:46] <Goraka91> ''Pictures taken moments before disaster''
[1:58:49] <Dragon_Batman> Good point, whos to say they wouldn't addthat if it was re created
[1:58:56] <+krispen_wa> Two was just a dumbass who fell in love with an even bigger dumbass
[1:59:12] <adithehella> yeah, the seeds in ffxiv seem more like artificial machine made seeds
[1:59:15] <jorniev> POOR FURIAE
[1:59:17] <%andrewofbob> Is it the thing from Destiny?
[1:59:19] <+Arnschen> Cent big dumb
[1:59:19] <adithehella> but thts so cool
[1:59:27] <jorniev> OH
[1:59:33] <Goraka91> Oh lawd The Traveler is a seed of destruction monkaS
[1:59:34] <@Solidus_113> the machines are trying everything they can to keep the fights going, pulling from all their data
[1:59:38] <jorniev> artificial seeds of destruction?
[1:59:42] <+senfood> I think it's the prototype of an original seed.
[1:59:43] <%Rixstarian> @krispen_wa Nasuverse is shit though
[1:59:52] <jorniev> THAT would be crazy
[1:59:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:59:52] <%strugglepunk2> what if the machines are the watchers?
[1:59:53] <VidulaSaix> If it's machine made, it would only know how it worked based on how people saw them work in the past. They'd have no idea of their true capabilities
[2:00:09] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus in german, the "abberation" hexcode translates to "grotesquerie"

[2:01:00] <gunstars20> LUL
[2:01:03] <Dragon_Batman> Noice
[2:01:09] <@Solidus_113> YOU THOUGHT
[2:01:31] <VidulaSaix> Did you catch Solidus' comment about the germa translation? @WoolieVersus
[2:01:35] <VidulaSaix> german*
[2:01:39] <smallboops> so its like, shadow mother angel lord
[2:01:46] <DatAsuna> And the flower/intoner one had regular faces
[2:01:57] <jorniev> red is the colour of masou which is magical energy right?
[2:02:01] <Applecannon63> oh god the black box cores
[2:02:03] <VidulaSaix> Thats the point
[2:02:08] <+senfood> CLINK CLINK BITCH
[2:02:44] <%X2Eliah> Eve was black+red+white right?
[2:02:55] <Applecannon63> Of course Eve
[2:02:56] <smallboops> so the machine lifeforms are just trying to mish mash all the elements together
[2:02:59] <jorniev> human data?
[2:03:08] <DatAsuna> I think it's just a replica of a seed
[2:03:12] <Applecannon63> HERES MANNA
[2:03:13] <+tigerfang86> God just leaving Death Orbs, wherever
[2:03:22] <+tigerfang86> for fun
[2:03:24] <@Solidus_113> not placed, but they show up when a world is in it's final days
[2:03:25] <%X2Eliah> @tigerfang86 just like irl
[2:03:27] <VidulaSaix> Manah just creeping out from the bottom
[2:03:32] <+krispen_wa> Drakengard is what happens when God attacks and dethrones humanity
[2:03:33] <+fugatlas> man he's really digging deep on this instead of just rolling with "they replicated one, like everything else"
[2:03:36] <+QueequegTheater> Drakengard God seems like maybe the worst fictional God ever
[2:03:39] <VidulaSaix> And yeah what Solidus said they werent left, they just appear when a world is near its end
[2:03:41] <%gatorafan> like that comic of the wizard dropping shotguns all over the place
[2:03:41] <BluBox> LALALA -Manna
[2:03:42] <adithehella> machine network becoming imperfect versions of watchers, neat
[2:03:48] <Applecannon63> thats Drakengard 2's Manna artwork
[2:03:52] <+QueequegTheater> Competing with SMT YHVH
[2:03:55] <DatAsuna> become as gods, even
[2:04:08] <+senfood> ...I'm not the only one who thinks that humans are the gods, right?
[2:04:26] <jorniev> i hope we get back to caim at some point, that homicidal maniac
[2:04:35] <+QueequegTheater> @senfood you are correct, the machines in automata view the extinct humans as gods
[2:04:36] <Klefth> Stop
[2:04:37] <VidulaSaix> We dont talk about D2
[2:04:38] <+Arnschen> We don't talk about that
[2:04:40] <%ZweihanderSteve> I always like to think that the watchers digitized themselves somehow PogChamp
[2:04:44] <Applecannon63> regardless of Drakengar 2 game but the artwork of the game is good
[2:04:48] <+Caidezes> Drakengard 2 is not canon.
[2:04:53] <alrobot2014> @queequegtheater iirc but isn't the state of the world in d3 god's revenge for killing jesus
[2:05:04] <VidulaSaix> D2 is like the americanized version that totally missed the mar of what made the first game what it was
[2:05:08] <VidulaSaix> mark*
[2:05:08] <+krispen_wa> is D4 the sequel to Drakengard 3
[2:05:09] <smallboops> DG2 isnt canon...until it somehow becomes canon >:V
[2:05:17] <DatAsuna> drakengard 2 is canon lol
[2:05:18] <+Arnschen> Best part of D2: Legna
[2:05:21] <guiltyboya> Ha yes, Drakengard. The mindf*ck game series. Of course
[2:05:22] <jorniev> CAIM is such a crazy asshole
[2:05:25] <%gatorafan> Caim was super cool on DoD2 tho
[2:05:25] <2DSuperiority> different director for Drakengard 2 so it's considered disrespectful to add or modify that story
[2:05:27] <DatAsuna> Just because it's bad doesn't mean it isn't canon
[2:05:34] <Applecannon63> But Caim is so cool in Drakengard 2 cause Beserk
[2:05:38] <adithehella> false idol and one gives even more relation to queen beast being or related to an intoner oo
[2:05:42] <VidulaSaix> @DatAsuna I mean Yoko wasnt involved really at all so LUL
[2:05:43] <+senfood> The machines merged with androids and the collected data of humanity to become a new lifeform that was blasted off in the Ark. That became the first Seed.
[2:05:45] <kerazykitsune> Songstress?
[2:05:45] <+QueequegTheater> @alrobot2014 Yes, which is why it doesn't bother me as a Catholic
[2:05:54] <DatAsuna> @VidulaSaix That's not the barometer for canon
[2:05:57] <+Arnschen> Utahime Five was the manga that gave all of them more backstory
[2:05:58] <T_Sasquatch> im honestly under the belief that most people that talk about drakengard have never played it LUL
[2:06:02] <+krispen_wa> Final boss PTSD intensifies
[2:06:15] <Klefth> God that final "fight" is fucked
[2:06:15] <+krispen_wa> Ending D of D3 is a good ending yes
[2:06:16] <VidulaSaix> @DatAsuna I mean I'll listen to the guy who tells the stories so
[2:06:22] <+yukichocomilk> all i know about drakengard is clemps videos LUL
[2:06:27] <ulcaban> I just want a spinoff game where 2P learnd proper hair styling, man
[2:06:33] <guiltyboya> I played to much of them. It's bad for my mental health. Please send help, I'm gonna end up wearing a moon on my head
[2:06:35] <Goraka91> Hm
[2:06:38] <chickenhunter> there's a modern day city in the Drakengard world that showed up one day. its where that boss fight happens in 3
[2:06:41] <+CptBritches> Arguing about Taro canon might be the the most useless things a human can do in an entire liftime
[2:06:50] <FirewallStorm> believe please watch the drakengard 3 final boss its some bs
[2:06:56] <T_Sasquatch> MODERNN DAYYY ? - Matt Voice
[2:06:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19

[2:07:07] <VidulaSaix> @krispen_wa You mean two?
[2:07:09] <DatAsuna> @VidulaSaix and until he tells it's not canon, it is. lol
[2:07:12] <%X2Eliah> mmmm that's a long pull imo
[2:07:14] <+Arnschen> 3's rhythm game was way harder than 1's

[2:07:17] <VidulaSaix> The FInal Song
[2:07:22] <+senfood> Nobody mention SinoAlice.

[2:07:33] <T_Sasquatch> fuck sinoalice LUL
[2:07:37] <%ZweihanderSteve> lalalala lalalala the watchers dance PogChamp
[2:07:38] <DatAsuna> Sinoalice is just 2B thinking to herself after a boss fight
[2:07:40] <guiltyboya> Arnschen - remember the last soundwave? Peperidge farm remembers
[2:07:41] <DatAsuna> It's super minor
[2:07:43] <T_Sasquatch> i cant believe i installed that shit
[2:07:43] <jorniev> i dont remember what the deal of one was she just hated zero and the others
[2:07:46] <DatAsuna> but yes it's canon
[2:07:53] <+krispen_wa> i tried sinoalice once then fell asleep playing it. the gameplay SUUUUCKS
[2:07:56] <+senfood> Oh yeah, and Taro has a new stage play.
[2:07:57] <+xerotwo> oh boy SinoAlice LUL
[2:08:18] <VidulaSaix> Yep

[2:11:25] <+CptBritches> She took lessons :)
[2:11:27] <DatAsuna> She could hack in automata she was just worse at it and needed the pod to help more
[2:11:28] <+projectmanatees> all can hack just scanners are better
[2:11:29] <+ArcanumArcanum> she could always hack. She hacks multiple times in Automata
[2:11:29] <Tracazoid> I guess Pod helped with the hacking
[2:11:33] <2DSuperiority> Pod have A2 the ability to hack in the Library
[2:11:35] <DatAsuna> A2 can hack
[2:11:36] <T_Sasquatch> eden raids are a mess blind :notlike
[2:11:37] <+dom3800> A2 can hack
[2:11:37] <Dragon_Batman> A2 could yea
[2:11:39] <@Solidus_113> the pod allowed them to hack
[2:11:40] <DatAsuna> They can all hack
[2:11:40] <+ArcanumArcanum> That's wrong woolie
[2:11:40] <+Caidezes> A2 can hack.
[2:11:43] <DatAsuna> 9S is just better
[2:11:43] <+Arnschen> 2B could hack just like how A2 could
[2:11:43] <guiltyboya> WRONG
[2:11:44] <Klefth> A2 could hack thanks to the pod
[2:11:45] <$genocidal_cupcake> THe pods can hack
[2:11:48] <halfmasks> they all can hack, scanners are just better at it
[2:11:50] <%illtima> I think they all can hack, but 9S is just the best at it
[2:11:50] <%Nested_Dreams> A2 can hack via Pod
[2:11:51] <%X2Eliah> No
[2:11:52] <+CookieCutter007> A2 says fuck em rules
[2:11:54] <%X2Eliah> Woolie no
[2:11:54] <DatAsuna> 9S is just the best hacker
[2:11:57] <%X2Eliah> Woolie big no
[2:11:59] <Jashter18> Scanners are just better at it
[2:11:59] <+kraajkase> they can all hack, 9S is just specifically designed for it
[2:11:59] <Tukaru> All YorHa units can interface the Ego Bridge
[2:12:01] <+Arnschen> Scanner models are better I'd assume
[2:12:04] <Goraka91> I guess all androids are capable of hacking to some capacity
[2:12:04] <jorniev> 9s is the best at it
[2:12:10] <adithehella> 9s can hack himself but 2b and a2 need the pods no?
[2:12:10] <%X2Eliah> Pod unlocked A2's ability to hack

[2:12:59] <+krispen_wa> yeah in the stage drama A2 counterhacks 9S
[2:13:00] <+QueequegTheater> Hildibrand is the missing link
[2:13:15] <AtrusHB> Vladmir Putin, YorHa scanner model RS
[2:13:18] <+CptBritches> Anogg is the key to Kingdom Hearts lore and Taroverse lore.
[2:13:25] <2DSuperiority> and then Hildi launches into the portal like he did the Red Moon LUL
[2:13:29] <Dragon_Batman> Not even just the stage drama the A2 ending she jumps him and hacks him
[2:13:40] <exnuart> they literally throw the square building in the fight
[2:13:45] <jorniev> THE FLOWEEEER
[2:13:50] <jorniev> YES
[2:13:51] <DatAsuna> no just all over
[2:13:55] <+toadlyy> When anogg went through the portal she ended up in Traverse Town
[2:13:56] <@Solidus_113> they're both, it's unclear
[2:13:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:14:02] <DatAsuna> she has a bunch of flowers in places
[2:14:08] <%Rixstarian> @toadlyy Gross
[2:14:13] <DatAsuna> Again it's like a weird replica mixup of multiple things
[2:14:13] <jorniev> OH this is crazy looking
[2:14:18] <+krispen_wa> is there a link between lunar tears and the flower? are they like its progeny?
[2:14:24] <jorniev> what part of the raid was that?
[2:14:26] <DatAsuna> N2 just had all of this in their archive and mixed it together
[2:14:27] <2DSuperiority> a wreath of Lunar Tears, like what Kaine has from her grandma
[2:14:33] <+krispen_wa> @jorniev the final boss
[2:14:40] <+bluedude153> 2 pregnent
[2:14:53] <kamenspidey> 2birth

[2:15:09] <Goraka91> 2Preggers
[2:15:18] <%Rixstarian> Can a being w/o a soul truly sing?
[2:15:19] <Applecannon63> 2P= To Pregnant
[2:15:21] <+krispen_wa> UNDER NIER IN-BIRTH
[2:15:22] <halfmasks> this cannot continue
[2:15:23] <%X2Eliah> Is the 'P' in "2P" meant to be "Pregnant"
[2:15:25] <%gatorafan> @goraka91 daedra1DrunkTibs
[2:15:26] <Applecannon63> To Pregnate
[2:15:29] <%X2Eliah> oh fuck you Taro
[2:15:31] <halfmasks> become as gods my dudes
[2:15:41] <%Rixstarian> @atrushb Keep Nomura's writing out of XIV please

[2:15:57] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Does Kirby count as vore, chat?
[2:16:01] <Dragon_Batman> Without features yea
[2:16:04] <%Rixstarian> @x2eliah Panasonic
[2:16:08] <Goraka91> @Rixstarian Can't escape Eden my man
[2:16:08] <+toadlyy> @atrushb next we need a tie-in to The World Ends with You to tie all of it together
[2:16:09] <Dragon_Batman> Mannequin pretty much
[2:16:10] <+krispen_wa> With LOOOOONG tongue
[2:16:10] <+tigerfang86> the original QUeen beast is a naked featureless woman
[2:16:11] <%X2Eliah> It was quite grotesque
[2:16:13] <+dom3800> Neither can the androids, according to Taro androids can replicate the human form perfectly but it just can't concieve for whatever reason
[2:16:17] <+Arnschen> It just looks like a featureless body with a KISS tongue
[2:16:21] <VidulaSaix> Isnt one of the Accord endings implying that the Queen Beast is what would have happened to Zero if one ending had kept going the way it did @WoolieVersus
[2:16:24] <HollowMan190> thats still kinda hot tho
[2:16:26] <jorniev> ANDS ITS PREGNANT
[2:16:29] <%Rixstarian> @goraka91 You mean the worst 8 man raid story?
[2:16:35] <+tigerfang86> oh yea its pregnant too lol
[2:16:41] <VidulaSaix> Its MEGA PREGNANT
[2:16:41] <+ApocalypticExpress> Apparently the original joke ending was supposed to have an Idol be the final boss lol
[2:16:42] <BluBox> Hyper preggers
[2:16:43] <+QueequegTheater> It's pretty hot NGL
[2:16:44] <Applecannon63> @rixstarian Normura is not always the blame
[2:16:48] <+CptBritches> Well, this is closer tot eh Drakengard 3 ending and it's probably supposed to be
[2:16:48] <+krispen_wa> GIANT PREGGERS
[2:16:51] <jorniev> GROTESQUERIES
[2:16:54] <Goraka91> @Rixstarian Yes
[2:17:00] <%Rixstarian> @applecannon63 KH is 99% him
[2:17:04] <jorniev> inhuman
[2:17:04] <@Solidus_113> yeah LUL
[2:17:06] <gunstars20> LUL
[2:17:07] <+tigerfang86> LITERALLY half asleep
[2:17:08] <%TheSniperJoe> TheSniperJoe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months!
[2:17:08] <%Major_Lee_> This is a very Final Fantasy looking design. Similar to the Sin Eaters
[2:17:10] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @VidulaSaix
[2:17:11] <Dragon_Batman> Yea Draken 1 is really fucked
[2:17:11] <jorniev> LUL I SAW THAT!
[2:17:13] <+MTLxSpider> i liked eden cuz ff8 nostagalia
[2:17:16] <%X2Eliah> Really the androids in Automata should have been horrifying
[2:17:20] <%X2Eliah> not secy
[2:17:22] <adithehella> i totally thought her infolrensence was zeero
[2:17:23] <roarofdamnation> Na Sonny has worse
[2:17:25] <%X2Eliah> sexy*
[2:17:25] <adithehella> when i first saw her
[2:17:25] <Tenkay> "Slient MC, Dragons, Knights, yeah sounds good ship it Taro"
[2:17:32] <+QueequegTheater> I liked the Eden story because they're a nice couple
[2:17:40] <VidulaSaix> He tried okay
[2:17:43] <Goraka91> Even machines say fuck ties
[2:17:44] <@Solidus_113> ascot?
[2:17:46] <AtrusHB> @Applecannon63 the people who do the writing are often not the same people that create the scenario
[2:17:49] <+MTLxSpider> werent yokotaro and yoship drunk when they wanted to do this collab. lol
[2:17:59] <%X2Eliah> oh I thought that was just a sarf xD
[2:18:05] <+Kyma1020> Maybe the Queen beast looks horrifying because a dead human was placed inside the seed?
[2:18:06] <Kenyuki4> Didn't Taro get yelled at by Square Enix for putting in Ending E in secret?
[2:18:20] <Goraka91> Kaine 0.5
[2:18:24] <gunstars20> LUL
[2:18:24] <%Rixstarian> @mtlxspider When are they sober?
[2:18:29] <jorniev> SHE LIKES TO PEG MEN
[2:18:30] <+MTLxSpider> yeah sober
[2:18:31] <+CookieCutter007> LUL
[2:18:31] <+Tevvy> yes we do?
[2:18:32] <+tigerfang86> its a pretty rough reason
[2:18:32] <adithehella> yes we do
[2:18:35] <+bluedude153> yes we do
[2:18:36] <Applecannon63> @rixstarian understood but for FF7 he saved it from the original's writers story
[2:18:36] <+Williamld> The flower is the main villain
[2:18:37] <+Kyma1020> The Flower is Evil
[2:18:37] <VidulaSaix> Flowers are like big evil in Tarovese and we dunno why yet LUL
[2:18:38] <Goraka91> It's extremely plot relevant
[2:18:38] <BluBox> We do know
[2:18:40] <%X2Eliah> The flower keeps her alive, no?
[2:18:42] <+krispen_wa> YES WE DO
[2:18:43] <LycheeMusings> YES WE DO
[2:18:44] <@Solidus_113> The flower is a thing from the gods
[2:18:45] <+bluedude153> its like the entire plot
[2:18:46] <AtrusHB> I want Zero to stomp on my face and call me demeaning names!
[2:18:52] <+RealPT1> evil flower, that's seems to be about it
[2:18:54] <Goraka91> The entire plot is about the flower eye
[2:18:54] <@Solidus_113> or a god itself
[2:18:55] <vnzuelandude> drakengard 3 remaster when
[2:19:00] <VidulaSaix> Its from a manga I think
[2:19:01] <%BisoromiBear> because taro liked rozen maiden
[2:19:01] <+krispen_wa> the flower is a fragment of an even biggeer more EVIL FLOWER
[2:19:01] <+QueequegTheater> "Shit's evil, idk"
[2:19:06] <HollowMan190> broken
[2:19:06] <%Rixstarian> @applecannon63 Oh I know. Not his writing though. But good editing/direction
[2:19:06] <+dotrook> kinda
[2:19:06] <+senfood> The flower comes from the black flower.
[2:19:07] <%ZweihanderSteve> a modern ass city rose out of a peninsula and gave the real world magic
[2:19:11] <+Williamld> The god who made the wathers made the flower
[2:19:15] <+Kyma1020> It just shows up to Zero
[2:19:15] <%X2Eliah> Needd to rewatch Clemps video for that
[2:19:15] <+fugatlas> gods made it
[2:19:17] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:19:17] <+dotrook> the flower hates humanity and saw a chance in Zero
[2:19:19] <jorniev> when the flower grows completely it ends the world
[2:19:21] <+ApocalypticExpress> read the manga geeze
[2:19:22] <+aishman> god
[2:19:23] <Blank9> no it just pops up
[2:19:24] <+OranHexthief> flower is how she becomes an intoner before the split
[2:19:26] <+dotrook> because Zero hated people INTENSELY
[2:19:27] <vnzuelandude> racist flower
[2:19:27] <+Smokebanshee> It's explained in a side novel
[2:19:29] <BluBox> God's a bitch
[2:19:31] <Blank9> and she's at ground zero of where it shows up
[2:19:33] <+RealPT1> It's FLowey's cousin, why not
[2:19:42] <+krispen_wa> Yoko Taro: READ THE SIDE NOVELS
[2:19:43] <+CptBritches> Woolie are you asking for a clear explanation to a Taro detail?
[2:19:43] <+bluedude153> god made it to start the apocolypse because they decided she was angry enough to do it
[2:20:00] <jorniev> that fight is so crazy
[2:20:02] <AtrusHB> Zero just wanted to fucking die, but the Flower wouldn't let her commit die
[2:20:03] <+dotrook> and it saved her as she was dying to be a host. then she tried to kill herself when she realized what the flower was, so it made the sisters as backups
[2:20:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> S*** SQUARE ENIX
[2:20:43] <AtrusHB> literally Zero's entire life was pure suffering
[2:20:47] <jorniev> RHYTHM GAME in the middle of a fight

[2:20:47] <@Solidus_113> actually play drakengard 1
[2:20:49] <roarofdamnation> Queen Beast is just a pregnant bald naked woman with a long tongue, i don't see what is so horrifying about it.
[2:20:50] <2DSuperiority> static, like it's a playback of a recording
[2:20:51] <@Solidus_113> for a mechanic
[2:20:53] <AtrusHB> even before the Flower
[2:20:57] <%Rixstarian> Even if Minh noticed, he wouldn't know anyway

[2:23:47] <sirthomas2step> What a way to go. Heroic af
[2:23:48] <%ZweihanderSteve> JSDF SAVING THE WORLD D:
[2:23:50] <Blank9> rip caim and angelus
[2:23:52] <Dragon_Batman> And they're like oooh shit monsters shoot it down
[2:23:52] <kamenspidey> mission accomplished boys
[2:23:55] <gunstars20> ACE COMBAT LET'S GO
[2:23:57] <jorniev> world doomed
[2:23:58] <Blank9> then they take the corpses and make magic out of them
[2:23:59] <Applecannon63> DAMN ACE COMBAT
[2:23:59] <Space_Pagan> fuck them dragons
[2:23:59] <zenith0111> @woolieversus In the Nier lore they mention how no one knows whos jet shot dowm the dragon
[2:24:01] <VidulaSaix> And then Angelus becomes the basis for all the magic in Nier
[2:24:02] <+krispen_wa> Ace combat doomed the world
[2:24:05] <DatAsuna> No, because ace combat is namco and the strangereal
[2:24:09] <+tigerfang86> those 2 be fuckin
[2:24:10] <Klefth> YEAH! The JSDF saved the worl-- OH SHIT
[2:24:10] <%Javaa01> Except Ace Combat takes place on Strangereal and not Earth but fuck it, it's not that important in a reference
[2:24:18] <sirthomas2step> We did it! psssshoooooo BOOM
[2:24:19] <%Major_Lee_> I don’t think that’s the strangereal
[2:24:19] <2DSuperiority> warm me as you once did zoneDosh
[2:24:22] <Blank9> the only good part of drakengard 2 was caim and angelus
[2:24:23] <jorniev> CAIM fucked that dragon right?
[2:24:24] <BluBox> Inuart doomed the world
[2:24:29] <+QueequegTheater> Wasn't it the corpse of Angelus that caused WCS?
[2:24:30] <Dragon_Batman> Whether alive or dead shit was fucked
[2:24:30] <DatAsuna> most ace combats are not on earth
[2:24:31] <haitakaa> and killing the dragon gave us red magic
[2:24:31] <mesamus> it was screwed the moment the queen arrived
[2:24:31] <ITechedDat> shoot first, ask questions never
[2:24:32] <+Rafraud> Circumstances doomed the world
[2:24:33] <%X2Eliah> Their appearance already introduced all the elements
[2:24:39] <+CookieCutter007> i'm always salt
[2:24:40] <Applecannon63> Caim X Angelus
[2:24:40] <+fugatlas> ah yiiiis we're getting to the good part of this thoery
[2:24:42] <Goraka91> Caim/Angelus just mean we got magic and delayed the fucking
[2:24:42] <Tracazoid> Yeah as soon as the portal opened Earth was screwed
[2:24:43] <+MTLxSpider> ace combat ff14 collab when
[2:24:46] <+bluedude153> yall he is not literally saying ace combat is part of nier jesus christ
[2:24:50] <+fugatlas> sleeping beauty time boiiiiisss
[2:24:51] <Blank9> no, corpse of the grotesquery is what caused WCS
[2:25:00] <Blank9> corpse of angelus is what gave humans magic to make gestalts
[2:25:04] <ITechedDat> @mtlxspider raid boss on the wing
[2:25:06] <+MTLxSpider> featuring jpg dog
[2:25:11] <sirthomas2step> The idea lf a dead gods corpse having immense fallout is brutal
[2:25:12] <2DSuperiority> @QueequegTheater Queen beast caused WCS, Angelus was studied to create magic
[2:25:15] <Applecannon63> Red Dragons are better than Black Dragons
[2:25:18] <%Major_Lee_> Go look up that human body angelus with a dragon head from the joke dating sim
[2:25:19] <%X2Eliah> uhhh
[2:25:19] <+krispen_wa> dragons are an enemy to watchers so maybe angelus could have done something
[2:25:20] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus the text adventure forest
[2:25:25] <%X2Eliah> I don't get this one
[2:25:32] <sirthomas2step> Apocalyptic Gumbo
[2:25:39] <Tenkay> the big tree in the original nier had the memories of the world on it
[2:25:48] <DatAsuna> and that's how the baby was made
[2:25:52] <%Skullgod> text adventure tree was a data center
[2:25:55] <+tigerfang86> the text adventure tree
[2:25:56] <+Arnschen> Yeah, it was a big terminal
[2:25:56] <Dragon_Batman> Yea the big tree was a super computer basically
[2:26:02] <+aishman> Text adventure
[2:26:02] <DatAsuna> It's a replica of the first time nier did the text adventure
[2:26:03] <haitakaa> the tree stored all the memories
[2:26:05] <VidulaSaix> It has a murky memory of what happened with Angelus and as a result its attempt to recreate Ending E came out half unfinished. Thats basically what its saying
[2:26:07] <zenith0111> Nier lore is dense and were on the edge of a rabbit hole
[2:26:08] <Ethel9727> The tree is expanded on more in Grimoire NieR
[2:26:09] <%X2Eliah> Well yeah, Nier Tree was a data center
[2:26:09] <jorniev> OH the text adventure tree
[2:26:16] <VidulaSaix> Yes
[2:26:17] <+Artemis_Scowl> yeah
[2:26:17] <+Kyma1020> Yes
[2:26:18] <%Skullgod> the network took information from it
[2:26:19] <+Arnschen> The tree *was* the data center
[2:26:19] <Robot_Nixon_> idk lol
[2:26:21] <Tenkay> Yes
[2:26:22] <@Solidus_113> it's a pull, but basically
[2:26:23] <DatAsuna> No, the network came with the machines
[2:26:24] <+tigerfang86> that's the idea I think
[2:26:27] <%X2Eliah> ... Maybe
[2:26:28] <Dragon_Batman> It held human information and they used that
[2:26:29] <sirthomas2step> That's a bad ass oak
[2:26:29] <+Kyma1020> The tree is the Network
[2:26:29] <%Skullgod> it didnt become the network, the network took information from the tree
[2:26:30] <DatAsuna> the tree is old human network
[2:26:35] <+dante_must_die_exe> that's what they're leaning into\
[2:26:37] <Psyramics> or the machine network absorbed the tree into itself
[2:26:37] <kamenspidey> imagine having board room meetings discussing saving humanity while turning to salt
[2:26:38] <chickenhunter> the machine network appropriated the Tree's network
[2:26:38] <haitakaa> the machines hacked the tree
[2:26:39] <zenith0111> FF14 Nier stuff is canon to Nier?
[2:26:39] <VidulaSaix> The machine network's basis came from the tree
[2:26:41] <DatAsuna> The machine network isn't around pre invasion
[2:26:41] <%X2Eliah> Maybe the Network absorbed the tree info
[2:26:42] <Tenkay> the machine network gets the info the tree has so it has EVERYTHING
[2:26:42] <%Zepik> All gestalt data was stored in the tree with the plan to put it back in the replicants when the world was no longer fucked
[2:26:45] <Applecannon63> Tree is the Human Network
[2:26:47] <+fugatlas> to a degree: the machine network has all of human history, which the tree did also, so the pull is at some point the assimilated
[2:26:51] <DatAsuna> The machine network just absorbed it yes
[2:26:54] <Tenkay> The tree is the data and the machine network gets it from there
[2:26:55] <DatAsuna> It's not direct
[2:26:55] <+toadlyy> Tree is the network
[2:26:56] <Applecannon63> its what stored the replicants
[2:26:57] <%Skullgod> TREE IS THE HUMAN NETWORK, THE MACHIENS STOLE THE DATA
[2:26:58] <+pissdegaulle> the network came with the aliens, they just took info from it
[2:27:00] <+CptBritches> The network used info from it at least is the idea
[2:27:00] <haitakaa> wrong
[2:27:08] <@mothmandraws> again, FF14 is the most important piece of lore in taro-verse
[2:27:13] <+fugatlas> and since N2 "has a bunch of memories sleeping inside of it", the idea is that it still has each individual gestalt mind in it
[2:27:15] <DedlokPM> I mean, ending E had shown the tree literally recreating Nier
[2:27:18] <+MTLxSpider> lol
[2:27:18] <@Solidus_113> that's a line from NieR when you do the big text reading
[2:27:19] <DatAsuna> The tree is not the network because then machine life forms wouldn't be related to the aliens
[2:27:22] <adithehella> the ffxiv raid is a genuine part of drakennier confirmed lmao
[2:27:27] <Darksolerino> the coolest thing about Nier is how the robots got rid of the aliens
[2:27:27] <zenith0111> @zepik Wait so they were going t rezz the dragon?
[2:27:29] <+CptBritches> FF14 is the most important piece of lore in humanity
[2:27:33] <%ThisIsLloyd> SPOILER: I would absolutely love to find out how the replicants became self aware and fucked the entire plan for humans in the first place
[2:27:34] <DatAsuna> The machine network came with the aliens
[2:27:40] <%X2Eliah> I took it as the machine network reading/loading the tree data
[2:27:42] <jorniev> text adventure tree was crazy
[2:27:47] <@mothmandraws> guys, what if accord is an ascian
[2:27:55] <@mothmandraws> or an allegan robot
[2:27:57] <+dom3800> The machines just absorbed the tree
[2:27:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:27:58] <Tracazoid> Beepy helped as well create the machine network as it is
[2:27:58] <VidulaSaix> The machine network assimilated the tree
[2:27:59] <+Arnschen> The machine network incorporated the tree
[2:28:07] <+pissdegaulle> noooooo the network just took the data from the tree
[2:28:09] <+Arnschen> The machine network came from the aliens still
[2:28:09] <DatAsuna> The aliens DID make the network the tree is a seperate human made thing
[2:28:10] <+fugatlas> maybe not became, but at least assimilated. It would explain how the network learned so much about humanity
[2:28:10] <zenith0111> Accord was possibly in the Jet that killed the Dragon
[2:28:11] <+Rafraud> Accord has all the answers
[2:28:11] <%Skullgod> WOOLIE PLEASE
[2:28:12] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[2:28:13] <%Rixstarian> To be fair, I still blame Woolie's weak Automata memories on Liam.
[2:28:14] <prime_name> Taro does whatever
[2:28:14] <Dragon_Batman> The network used the trees data
[2:28:15] <chickenhunter> the Machine Network assimilated the tree
[2:28:15] <+Kyma1020> The Aliens look plant like don't they Woolie?
[2:28:16] <Jashter18> The network stole from the tree
[2:28:20] <+CptBritches> Not necessarily that the tree became the network but the network USED DATA from the tree
[2:28:23] <Saltmeisterr> No the network took info from the tree
[2:28:23] <VidulaSaix> The machine network assimilated the tree into itself @WoolieVersus
[2:28:24] <LordOfThePoultry> the network absorbed the data from the tree
[2:28:25] <DatAsuna> Yes the alien internet ate the human internet
[2:28:29] <Tenkay> @mothmandraws The allagans built beepy who became the machine network boom
[2:28:31] <Dragon_Batman> Think of it like using it as a foundation
[2:28:32] <zenith0111> Its a copypase
[2:28:35] <T_Sasquatch> Calm your brain bro LUL
[2:28:39] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:28:43] <Applecannon63> The aliens plant themselves into the tree
[2:28:43] <+Arnschen> LUL
[2:28:46] <Kenyuki4> The machines just took that shit
[2:28:46] <%Skullgod> >:(
[2:28:47] <%X2Eliah> Tree made human network that made aliens that made machine network that loaded tree data :P
[2:28:49] <DatAsuna> Skulgod has a job to do
[2:28:49] <2DSuperiority> @mothmandraws A race long past trying to resurrect from a catastrophe that caused their end? nahhhhh
[2:28:51] <+dante_must_die_exe> please remember everything, woolie
[2:28:51] <VidulaSaix> Yes theres more
[2:28:56] <+QueequegTheater> We should fight the Knights of the Round to clear your memory
[2:28:56] <Louie_Salmon> LUL
[2:28:56] <%SkellyVee> woolieLORE
[2:28:57] <Goraka91> How deep does the rabbit hole go
[2:28:57] <+aishman> The machine network absorbed the tree. It's what made the machines rebel against the aliens since they became obsessed with humans.
[2:28:59] <%Skullgod> moon2GUNCH moon2GUNCH
[2:29:02] <+Artemis_Scowl> Yeah the network took all information fromt the tree, which is WHY the network has all human memories
[2:29:04] <+fugatlas> what's also interesting is that emil's whole plot in automata confirms that the alien war REALLY HAPPENED
[2:29:05] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it doesn't help that you don't remember Nier and Automata
[2:29:06] <+ClericOfSparda> this is a deep rabbit hole
[2:29:07] <+CptBritches> We don't forgive you for not understanding Yoko Taro
[2:29:15] <%Major_Lee_> No mercy
[2:29:15] <sirthomas2step> Woolies Lore Scouter is about to burst
[2:29:16] <@Solidus_113> you wanted nier content, this is all your nier content. no silly dwarves
[2:29:19] <Kenyuki4> Woolie why don't you have perfect memory wtf??
[2:29:19] <DXLelouch24> Maybe the aliens are connected too the watchers?
[2:29:20] <VidulaSaix> You've got like 20+ posts to go LUL
[2:29:22] <+krispen_wa> I feel like Yoko Taro doesnt actually want people to go this deep into the lore
[2:29:26] <Robot_Nixon_> this lore is convoluted as fuck
[2:29:27] <+QueequegTheater> WOOLIE YOU WANTED THIS
[2:29:30] <+pissdegaulle> basically the network took data of everything and they're copying it, the end.
[2:29:32] <T_Sasquatch> starting to realise i didnt care about nier lore THIS much LUL
[2:29:34] <Jashter18> At this rate Woolie needs to get Clemps in a Discord call and make this a podcast LUL
[2:29:36] <%HeroToxiko> the aliens were killed off by the machines, in a revolution that we only learn about near the end of automata
[2:29:37] <jorniev> this is the real nier experience?
[2:29:39] <+MTLxSpider> ff14 lore
[2:29:43] <zenith0111> @krispen_wa Im not sure via through FF14 at least
[2:29:45] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[2:29:48] <jaysondeez> they digitally recreated magic?
[2:29:50] <Kenyuki4> @jorniev Yes
[2:29:56] <Dragon_Batman> I can't blame you
[2:30:00] <Louie_Salmon> Gotta rewatch all of Drakengard real quick as well
[2:30:17] <Louie_Salmon> And get that Nier replay in, just make sure we're fresh on everything
[2:30:17] <@mothmandraws> I am waiting for the reveal that the seeds were made by the amaroutians, so to understand nier you have to understand all of ff14
[2:30:20] <%HeroToxiko> the machines meaning the aliens army, not yorha
[2:30:22] <+bluedude153> its not homework man its just a evocative of nier shit
[2:30:22] <+dom3800> Clemps is in the middle of a stream, don't interrupt them
[2:30:24] <%Skullgod> you can see woolies mind expanding in real time right now
[2:30:26] <zenith0111> Like thats cool but it kinda adds nothing to what we know
[2:30:29] <+CptBritches> You need to read all the stage play transcripts and watch the musical and watch Taro's interviews to truly understand
[2:30:34] <Dragon_Batman> @Jdrockefeller Yea using the body of the dragon they were able to
[2:30:42] <+pissdegaulle> they're just imitating, that's it
[2:30:42] <+krispen_wa> what does this lore do for the storytelling
[2:30:45] <+KisukeOboro> The glass shatter seems similar to how Sin Eaters die
[2:30:48] <%X2Eliah> You need to understand that the Nier protagonist's name is not Nier
[2:30:52] <jorniev> just invite mr clemps to the podcast
[2:30:55] <%X2Eliah> Very important
[2:30:59] <Goraka91> Well of course not genius
[2:31:35] <+krispen_wa> if you wanted disparate lore connections, you coulda just gotten into Blazblue, Nasuverse, or Kingdom Hearts
[2:31:40] <+CptBritches> She took a codeacademy class :)
[2:32:05] <Robot_Nixon_> kingdom hearts makes more sense atpCap
[2:32:05] <%X2Eliah> I hope a Sphere of Destruction shows up in Naruto verse
[2:32:22] <@Solidus_113> maybe they're the same
[2:32:22] <+fugatlas> keep goin, the cover this theorist covers this line of logic in a bit
[2:32:24] <%Rixstarian> The Seed did
[2:32:25] <+Kyma1020> The ark is the seed
[2:32:28] <zenith0111> FF14 devs have stated all crossovers events are canon to FF14 but not to the promo series
[2:32:30] <+Rafraud> There's enough prior info to believe that it did
[2:32:31] <+bluedude153> And we will never know because it doesnt truly matter :v
[2:32:32] <blue6sub6remnant6> I'm two hours late to the cork-board party, aren't I?
[2:32:35] <+unremarkableprodigy> Copy of the arc
[2:32:39] <%X2Eliah> Ark -> machine seed, no?
[2:32:48] <Dragon_Batman> @blue6sub6remnant6 Yep
[2:32:49] <+MTLxSpider> 👏
[2:32:50] <+Rafraud> Arc is machine seed yeah
[2:32:50] <@mothmandraws> nah zenith, yoko said this is canon
[2:33:15] <zenith0111> Thats beyond lame
[2:33:21] <mistformll> There were the Meat Box, Soul Box, and God Box in Automata.
[2:33:27] <+senfood> DATABASE DATABASE
[2:33:29] <+Rafraud> Its a data womb
[2:33:30] <@mothmandraws> living in the database
[2:33:31] <%X2Eliah> "it's artificial"
[2:33:35] <+CptBritches> That is actually something Taro could do
[2:33:36] <roarofdamnation> Woolie it is The Arc, and The Arc manufacturing a false seed, a Machine Created Seed
[2:33:38] <T_Sasquatch> DATA BASED
[2:33:47] <%Major_Lee_> DATA BASED
[2:33:48] <Louie_Salmon> We are all living in the database
[2:33:50] <dds333a> BUT DO YOU GET IT, THO
[2:33:51] <Louie_Salmon> Woah-oh
[2:33:52] <+CptBritches> Based Zero

[2:34:16] <dds333a> Birth LUL LUL LUL
[2:34:17] <+krispen_wa> Is this the Sekiro unbirth ending?
[2:34:26] <%Rixstarian> @zenith0111 It is
[2:34:26] <@mothmandraws> zenith, just wait for annog to show up in another nier thing
[2:34:26] <%X2Eliah> @zenith0111 Oh it's hardcore cannon
[2:34:27] <jorniev> machines trying to recrate that crazy magic god shit
[2:34:30] <Goraka91> @zenith0111 Why
[2:34:30] <@mothmandraws> tru lore important dwarf
[2:34:43] <+CptBritches> If you don't think any of the FF14 is canon then you just need to give up on Taro stuff

[2:35:11] <+CookieCutter007> I want off Yoko Taro's wild ride
[2:35:11] <@mothmandraws> I wonder if woolie expected the ff14 nier raids to be sor lore dense lol
[2:35:15] <jorniev> woolie did you feel like this with guilty gear?
[2:35:16] <Louie_Salmon> ! LORE !
[2:35:20] <+CptBritches> THIS IS WHAT TARO DESERVES
[2:35:21] <2DSuperiority> Can't wait to see Anogg in DoD4
[2:35:22] <+vitoxxi> this seem overly complex, good thing i dont know anything about nier
[2:35:25] <Tracazoid> Forest of Myth text adventure struggles
[2:35:39] <smallboops> ty for heeding warnings woolie haha
[2:35:39] <+fugatlas> @mothmandraws but the dumb dwarves tho
[2:35:43] <%czeekytv> @mothmandraws considering his initial expectations going in, I'd say nowhere close lol
[2:35:55] <+senfood> Man, Forestof Myth in Replicant is a whole other can of lore worms.
[2:35:56] <+krispen_wa> Okay but how does the Soul Calibur crossover fit into this
[2:36:03] <Jashter18> @vitoxxi The stupidest thing is it all technically makes a certain amount of sense when you do know the lore
[2:36:10] <+Arnschen> Hrmm
[2:36:10] <Applecannon63> Teleportation
[2:36:16] <dds333a> @vitoxxi not always complex, but always a lot
[2:36:18] <+Arnschen> I wonder if it would have just been on this Shard
[2:36:19] <Applecannon63> thats the SC answer
[2:36:22] <+vitoxxi> really?
[2:36:26] <+vitoxxi> crazy
[2:36:31] <kamenspidey> are the sfm animations canon?
[2:36:31] <%Irridium> That's right Automata crossed with Soul Calibur which crossed with Witcher which means next Witcher is Automata 2 confirmed
[2:36:42] <+krispen_wa> did a seed reach the soul calibur universe? is the SC universe fucked?
[2:36:44] <Klefth> Everything else is just barren desert
[2:36:49] <+QueequegTheater> Yes
[2:36:51] <Psyramics> Seed of Destruction in Witcher 4, lets goooo

[2:37:33] <@mothmandraws> hit me up
[2:37:36] <Jashter18> NiER Lore video series when
[2:37:42] <jaysondeez> this would have been 10/10th if this came to pass and fucked the last bit
[2:37:44] <adithehella> @DedlokPM omg wow
[2:37:45] <@mothmandraws> ive got new art tech
[2:37:45] <Goraka91> @Tukaru Presumably
[2:37:46] <Tracazoid> I assume this is what Blazblue lore fans must feel
[2:37:54] <KnightAsteran> fun ff14 lore fact, Dragons are aliens
[2:37:56] <dds333a> @x2eliah Naruto lore isn't particularly extensive. Hellsing unironically has more lore
[2:38:02] <+CptBritches> COPIED TOKYO
[2:38:10] <Goraka91> The important question is what's on the other side
[2:38:12] <Tukaru> It is called The Copied Factory as well
[2:38:12] <zenith0111> I absolutely hate how all of this is in another videogame. Fuck this inudstry
[2:38:16] <+MTLxSpider> @KnightAsteran isnt that jsut FF in general
[2:38:17] <Applecannon63> Tokyo=LAND OF THE GODS
[2:38:21] <%Tearonex> infinite copied Tokyos
[2:38:23] <%Rixstarian> 3D printing
[2:38:24] <+dotrook> this might take place many thousands of years after automata.
[2:38:25] <%czeekytv> @zenith0111 this is just Taro lol
[2:38:26] <@mothmandraws> nah zenith this is just a taro thing
[2:38:29] <@mothmandraws> only taro would do this
[2:38:31] <adithehella> is the game made in tokyo
[2:38:32] <+Berb64> The building she throws at the raid is the Square building
[2:38:36] <+dotrook> with how the machines have gotten more advance
[2:38:36] <DatAsuna> No
[2:38:37] <Goraka91> @zenith0111 lmao do you even Nier
[2:38:38] <VidulaSaix> Definitely not
[2:38:38] <Klefth> The machine network has just become Grey Goo
[2:38:39] <%TomAtlus> No
[2:38:41] <+astrofizzix> I wonder how P-33 and the Fires of Prometheus still fits in here.
[2:38:42] <+Arnschen> No
[2:38:43] <%TomAtlus> Absolutely not
[2:38:43] <%Tearonex> no
[2:38:44] <%ThisIsLloyd> tokyo is like the linchpin for this whole loop maybe a version exists everywhere now
[2:38:46] <+krispen_wa> @zenith0111 its not the industry. its just Yoko Taro
[2:38:48] <Jashter18> No it would be the aliens arrival I assume
[2:38:48] <%X2Eliah> ?
[2:38:49] <+fugatlas> ff14 dragons are 100% canon aliens
[2:38:49] <+Arnschen> It would be the Aliens
[2:38:49] <VidulaSaix> The Aliens didnt arrive until thousands of years after
[2:38:51] <+senfood> Oh my god, the Cathedral City in Drakengard is another Copied City/Tokyo
[2:38:51] <%X2Eliah> Aliens
[2:38:53] <DatAsuna> Sleeping beauty explicitly says it LOST the memory of the red dragon falling @WoolieVersus
[2:38:56] <%TomAtlus> Machines came in and came across all of that crazed bullshit afterwards
[2:38:57] <%HeroToxiko> naruto lore: it was aliens just alien human hybrids on a continent isolated from the world
[2:38:58] <+dotrook> maybe this is the city that appears in drakengard 3
[2:39:00] <+CptBritches> No, I think it specifically comes from the ayyyyy lmaos
[2:39:01] <%X2Eliah> Aliens -> Machine Netowkr
[2:39:01] <+pissdegaulle> do you mean when they started existing or how far their info goes back to?
[2:39:01] <dds333a> Saint Seiya also has horseshit amounts of lore, more than one would expect
[2:39:01] <jaysondeez> like a plauge trying to copy humanity to any world it can invade?
[2:39:01] <KnightAsteran> they assimilated that data into the machine network and that took 9ver the network @woolieversus
[2:39:03] <adithehella> if game made in tokyo then it is the realm of the gods in a way
[2:39:07] <+unremarkableprodigy> It starts with the tree
[2:39:07] <zenith0111> @krispen_wa Then I hate him if thats the case
[2:39:11] <Klefth> Are you familiar with the Grey Goo apocalypse scenario, Woolz? @WoolieVersus
[2:39:11] <%Rixstarian> @zenith0111 Nier came from Drakengard. You should hate Nier if you didn't like Drakengard 1
[2:39:13] <chickenhunter> the Machines were made after the Aliens arrived to earth. They have knowledge of Earth's history through the Forest Of Myth
[2:39:13] <Robot_Nixon_> the aliens atpCap atpCap atpCap
[2:39:14] <%X2Eliah> Then it's Ending E
[2:39:14] <jorniev> I DONT KNOW
[2:39:16] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus The forest says it forgot the red dragon and queen beast
[2:39:16] <+Arnschen> Yes
[2:39:18] <+senfood> Cathedral City is descriibed as a futuristic city with advanced knowledge in magic.
[2:39:19] <+krispen_wa> does that mean the next nier game will have copied dwarf cities
[2:39:20] <%X2Eliah> Forest has info of Ending E
[2:39:21] <VidulaSaix> Sleeping Beauty didnt exist until around the time of Nier as far as we know @WoolieVersus
[2:39:24] <%Nested_Dreams> Not machines' timeline, but perhaps the forest's?
[2:39:29] <Robot_Nixon_> they're just called the aliens atpCap
[2:39:30] <Jashter18> Sleeping Beauty says she lost the memory of the Queen Beast and the dragon though
[2:39:30] <blue6sub6remnant6> #I'mNotSayingItWasAliensBut
[2:39:30] <%Mathochism> Now, the real question is how does NieR Reincarnation fall into all of this, lol?
[2:39:31] <+CptBritches> Yeah but they took the info from THE TREE
[2:39:40] <VidulaSaix> Possibly
[2:39:40] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus The forest says that it forgot the red dragon and queen beast/Ending E
[2:39:52] <+pissdegaulle> that's a lot of data
[2:39:52] <+CptBritches> YEPPERS
[2:39:54] <mistformll> Aliens send down machines and they met and fuse with Sleeping Beauty database.
[2:39:55] <DatAsuna> "I lost that memory, a shame it was a favorite of mine"
[2:39:57] <+krispen_wa> yes
[2:39:58] <%Nested_Dreams> The clorination dust might end up carrying information?
[2:40:02] <VidulaSaix> @DatAsuna It didnt forget it, it just lost it. Implying it somehow was recovered
[2:40:02] <+pissdegaulle> how many HDDs is that, whew
[2:40:05] <VidulaSaix> Its about to gain a lot more traction after next weeks podcast LUL
[2:40:05] <+CptBritches> HAHHAHAHA
[2:40:06] <Tukaru> The Machines in Automata are a mix of Aliens and the YorHa which were the remains of the NieR gestalt plot yes?
[2:40:07] <%Rixstarian> @zenith0111 Your logic doesn't blend w/ this industry. There is cross-pollination in the products
[2:40:07] <+unremarkableprodigy> But the tree is missing some information
[2:40:10] <Goraka91> LUL
[2:40:10] <%X2Eliah> @DatAsuna Ya, but wasn't it implied that the forrst memories can be recovered?

[2:41:21] <%X2Eliah> Man that Eve watcher tattoo is so weird
[2:41:28] <VidulaSaix> I always found this answer to be total bullshit because the symbol he gets on his chest is super from Drakengard 3
[2:41:30] <dds333a> It's difficult to make everybody happy
[2:41:33] <Louie_Salmon> Okay now this is just Automata speculation
[2:41:54] <+krispen_wa> so if a machine simulates the watchers through calculations, does it create watchers
[2:41:56] <Louie_Salmon> Which I mean, this all is, and that's all good
[2:42:00] <DatAsuna> I wonder if this guy often looks at his notifications? :P
[2:42:09] <boardscanada> you should check out some of those endings from Drakengard 1
[2:42:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:42:10] <dds333a> So it goes everywhere
[2:42:12] <DatAsuna> I doubt he's sorry

[2:48:22] <VidulaSaix> THE FIINAL POST
[2:48:25] <VidulaSaix> 1 hour ago LUL
[2:48:31] <zenith0111> But Machine Cores are all organic...
[2:48:37] <%ArkSeaside> I've been approximating a Marisa Kirisame cosplay for years so you best believe I snapped up a side braid with a white ribbon
[2:48:40] <%X2Eliah> woolie
[2:48:41] <+SunnyVarietyPack> i hope so
[2:48:46] <+fugatlas> OP updated this thread WHILE WE WERE READING IT
[2:48:47] <Goraka91> Turns out the stubbies were based on dwarves all along
[2:48:48] <Psyramics> no, machine cores resemble organics
[2:48:48] <VidulaSaix> Still being updated monkaS
[2:48:48] <lazysaiyajin> Woooo
[2:49:00] <+krispen_wa> If you keep deepdiving this lore, a God will come and ask you to join it or get turned into salt
[2:49:00] <Applecannon63> But Machines Cores are android cores
[2:49:07] <@Solidus_113> yeah that makes sense
[2:49:09] <zenith0111> Robots are alive in this universe
[2:49:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:49:11] <LordOfThePoultry> that would make sense
[2:49:12] <Ks201> a player could make a lala 2p cause we have everything we need to do it ingame
[2:49:12] <+MTLxSpider> make sense
[2:49:12] <Dragon_Batman> Well assuming it can be one of the endings the arc had that data anyway
[2:49:15] <%X2Eliah> so thats ending c/d/e though
[2:49:28] <mistformll> 9S did go aboard the Arc if you accept it.
[2:49:30] <Tukaru> The coins we get from the final raid same "The Ark" on them
[2:49:31] <+yukichocomilk> wtf is the arc? I wasn't here from the start
[2:49:32] <@Solidus_113> we goin full 13 sentinels
[2:49:36] <Klefth> That's what the latest log says
[2:49:37] <+fugatlas> that also builds in to ending E of automata, 2B and 9S's profiles are in the network now, the same way that pod realized
[2:49:38] <VidulaSaix> Either that, or the Seed IS the Arc. It could be either or
[2:49:41] <%HeroToxiko> @X2Eliah taro wrote a play after
[2:49:41] <jaysondeez> that would be rad
[2:49:44] <+krispen_wa> Is the arc the BEGINNING of the Drakengard universe?
[2:49:48] <+krispen_wa> What the fuck?
[2:49:52] <+pissdegaulle> oohhhhh
[2:49:54] <GunstarContra> 9S too smart to stay shackled by the Machine Network.
[2:49:54] <VidulaSaix> No LUL
[2:49:55] <Goraka91> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2:49:57] <+krispen_wa> Is the Ark the Drakengard GOD?
[2:50:00] <Dragon_Batman> @yukichocomilk Do you remember the thing that shot out from the tower in Nier Automata?
[2:50:02] <+senfood> @yukichocomilk The Arc is the one from Automata
[2:50:03] <Louie_Salmon> But would 2B be on the Arc? Or at least a backup of her?
[2:50:07] <dds333a> I dunno...
[2:50:10] <zenith0111> Oooooh weird
[2:50:14] <Tukaru> 2B and 9S are Virus Protectors on the Seeds now.
[2:50:16] <+Rafraud> I mean its a theory
[2:50:16] <+unremarkableprodigy> What came first the chicken or the egg
[2:50:18] <+Rafraud> I could see it
[2:50:19] <+yukichocomilk> oh that
[2:50:21] <+dotrook> it woulda been wild if the machines ran into Omega weapon. Also terrible for everyone
[2:50:22] <zenith0111> I wonder if thats going to Drakengard
[2:50:23] <GunstarContra> The cathedral city had a bunch of 2B clones, remember.
[2:50:28] <Applecannon63> Isn't 9S the god and the reason for the Arc?
[2:50:29] <+NiktenKing> Re-what?
[2:50:29] <%X2Eliah> what
[2:50:30] <+Rafraud> I like to think that there is just one arc and it happened to land here
[2:50:36] <+NiktenKing> Re-who?
[2:50:38] <+senfood> Corwn of Thorns timeline confirmed!
[2:50:40] <Goraka91> @krispen_wa The achievement for killing Inflorescence is latin for ''god and machine'' so...
[2:50:45] <Kenyuki4> 2B and 9S are now Fate Characters
[2:50:46] <@mothmandraws> ye the dead 2bs in that room
[2:50:46] <%X2Eliah> @Applecannon63 proto-9s
[2:50:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> @NiktenKing Reboot is a 3d animated canadian tv show
[2:50:55] <dds333a> woolieS
[2:50:56] <zenith0111> So 2B is here to stay as the series protag?
[2:50:56] <Psyramics> I think assuming the arc had any involvement with the seeds is a stretch
[2:50:58] <Klefth> A2 carried 2B's data
[2:51:03] <+Arnschen> Wasn't her data also in the sword she gave to A2?
[2:51:04] <+dom3800> All 3 are rebuilt, only 9S goes on the arc
[2:51:05] <+NiktenKing> @sverisageadvice I know
[2:51:09] <VidulaSaix> Only 9S did as I recall
[2:51:13] <+krispen_wa> 2B and 9S are the Proto-Arthurs of Nier
[2:51:14] <adithehella> only 9S
[2:51:16] <mistformll> 9S was stabbed with a sword carrying 2B's data.
[2:51:23] <DatAsuna> 2B's data is just a copy of her from when she died though.
[2:51:26] <%SveriSageAdvice> @NiktenKing oh ok lol, didnt know if it was a joke or something
[2:51:26] <%X2Eliah> @mistformll hmmmm
[2:51:27] <jaysondeez> 2B and 9S act as protectors
[2:51:27] <%Rixstarian> There is a script ending that follows Automata E End
[2:51:29] <+dotrook> oh, I guess the N2 that wanted them to stay around to challenge them won out?

[2:51:37] <%dirkfunk1> 9s also had 2b's arm attached to him
[2:51:46] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah I guess 2B would be on the Arc then
[2:51:46] <+krispen_wa> A2 just fucks off
[2:51:47] <@Solidus_113> that too
[2:51:51] <%X2Eliah> @dirkfunk1 not the real one's tho
[2:51:52] <VidulaSaix> The arm was from a shell 2B. not the one he knew
[2:51:55] <+AnActualHermitCrab> man i wanna rip my gf's arm off and use it for my own... <3
[2:52:01] <DatAsuna> Also that's basically a split off from the mainline ending E of automata
[2:52:05] <jaysondeez> excuse for more cross overs with other series
[2:52:14] <Applecannon63> Isn't arm just a clone?
[2:52:20] <VidulaSaix> The arm is just a shell
[2:52:21] <Goraka91> Yoko Taro: no answers, only more questions
[2:52:22] <VidulaSaix> It's not 2B
[2:52:33] <+blue_cloak552> Is there a machine seed just chilling in soul calibur?
[2:52:41] <+Thatghostpepper> ^^^^
[2:52:42] <mistformll> 9S was also using a 2B arm as well but it got cut off IIRC.
[2:52:44] <GunstarContra> The Machine Network had 2B for a while before A2 killed her.
[2:52:52] <%ZweihanderSteve> lol
[2:52:52] <+pissdegaulle> infinite crossovers
[2:52:53] <Tukaru> Basically, the YorHa/NieR stuff doesn't affect FF14 going forward, but it did add a nugget of content to the Drakengard/NieR world
[2:52:54] <DatAsuna> And also like Honkai Impact/Genshin
[2:52:56] <zenith0111> LUL
[2:53:00] <Applecannon63> The Soul Edge is just Seed of Destruction
[2:53:12] <Goraka91> @blue_cloak552 Is there now a seed in Witcher continent
[2:53:18] <Dragon_Batman> And this is only one possibility
[2:53:22] <+krispen_wa> didnt Nier:A also collab with another gacha game recently? arent they gonna get fucked by a Seed of Destruction too
[2:53:23] <zenith0111> @tukaru Thats not as bad as I thought it would be tbh
[2:53:37] <DatAsuna> But it's also like Soma where that's just gonna be a copy of them while there's also copies of them made by the pods on earth.
[2:53:41] <%Rixstarian> @mistformll Clone arm, not real
[2:53:43] <%deadbeat34> so basically......Drakengard! 4!
[2:53:47] <dds333a> One could say
[2:53:49] <+Arnschen> @Tukaru Unless an Arc touches down in a Nier sequel lol
[2:53:55] <VidulaSaix> If this theory is true, I actually think it's sad because it means they're still trapped in a neverending war. However, it does tie in with the very first line your hear in Automata about wanting to find the God that put them on this cycle and wants her chance to kill them @WoolieVersus
[2:53:55] <adithehella> if the next nier game has a lalafell in it
[2:53:56] <adithehella> yall
[2:54:03] <+blue_cloak552> Yoko taro getting revenge from being forced to colab by making it canon that the colabs destroy their worlds
[2:54:04] <mistformll> Remember that Soul Calibur has connections with Legend of Zelda and Tekken as well so Drakengard might be visiting those places as well?
[2:54:14] <%dirkfunk1> doesnt a2 destroy the tower
[2:54:24] <@mothmandraws> nah blue It at most wrecks the 1st
[2:54:25] <adithehella> in ending c

[2:55:23] <%SkellyVee> peachmilkyHype
[2:55:28] <+dante_must_die_exe> wait did woolie read the reason behind why Nier exists?
[2:55:29] <Goraka91> @CptBritches It's actually one of the best Final Fantasy stories out there
[2:55:29] <@Solidus_113> we'll see in patch 5.55
[2:55:30] <vnzuelandude> NIER AUTOMATA TSHIRTS
[2:55:34] <smallboops> okay but did the data for the CEO of platinum make it onto the arc?
[2:55:36] <+AnActualHermitCrab> @CptBritches It's a favorite of mine, and a big chunk of it is free if you'd like to try it.

[2:55:45] <VidulaSaix> AND IM MAD
[2:55:48] <@mothmandraws> me
[2:55:48] <DatAsuna> Nope lol

[2:55:52] <+DreyfussFrost> Nope
[2:55:52] <Zebroneath> GUILTY
[2:55:53] <@Solidus_113> it's just a machine head
[2:55:54] <zenith0111> @mundanelotus Not just genra a different SERIES
[2:55:54] <%SveriSageAdvice> i absolutely thought it was
[2:55:54] <%X2Eliah> no
[2:55:55] <+Artemis_Scowl> EVERYONE DID
[2:55:56] <Dragon_Batman> Had no idea to be real
[2:55:56] <VidulaSaix> ABSOLUTELY 100%
[2:55:56] <allofthemused> it is
[2:55:56] <Psyramics> nope, was obviously a machine head
[2:55:57] <+invida> way too small
[2:55:57] <%dirkfunk1> yes lmao
[2:55:58] <%SkellyVee> yes
[2:56:01] <DatAsuna> speak for yourself
[2:56:01] <%SkellyVee> yes i did

[2:56:03] <+MTLxSpider> they TEASING
[2:56:05] <allofthemused> it's still in the environment
[2:56:06] <%Irridium> I wanted to believe
[2:56:06] <Psyramics> and joked about it being emil
[2:56:08] <%dirkfunk1> that must have been on purpose
[2:56:09] <Tukaru> It's only Emil's theme in the raid IIRC
[2:56:11] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Solidus_113 Is this a real Eva reference, because I don't know anymore.
[2:56:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:56:15] <Louie_Salmon> @psyramics To be fair, he has come out of a machine head as well
[2:56:20] <allofthemused> it's in anoggs room
[2:56:26] <Dragon_Batman> Thanks Friendo
[2:56:37] <Applecannon63> Dammit Taro
[2:56:38] <%X2Eliah> ... is emil data in the macine network? No, right?
[2:56:43] <@Solidus_113> No Knights showcase FeelsBadMan
[2:56:43] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus That sphere moves over the course of patches as well and ultimately ended up in Anoggs room on a pedastool. I feel like it was a big Jebaited

[3:06:44] <%X2Eliah> Levelling in an MMO is not that different to just labbing a whole lot
[3:06:47] <@Solidus_113> I know it's in NG+
[3:06:51] <Tukaru> The Solo duty isn't replayable yet?
[3:06:59] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus The whole story around this Gundam is actually based around the very Gundams you mentioned and is a bit of a love letter to a personal friend Yoshi P had that passed away a while ago. They were both huge Gundam fans
[3:07:00] <%Rixstarian> NG+ it

[3:07:02] <DatAsuna> There's also mechas in swtor, though it's basically playable raidbosses in the form of the iokath gods
[3:07:02] <Tukaru> You would have to NG+ it
[3:07:02] <+ActiveLink> you have to NG+ to redo sapphire
[3:07:06] <snow_soldier> I believe you can do the solo duty again to NG+
[3:07:07] <T_Sasquatch> @X2Eliah LUL , I unironically lab versus training dummies
[3:07:10] <+OblivionSword1> Is it repeatable ?

[3:07:12] <Tenkay> I dont think Sapphire is on NG+ yet is it
[3:07:12] <+Kyma1020> The cutscenes maybe replayable at the Minh
[3:07:13] <+QueequegTheater> NG+

[3:07:53] <+QueequegTheater> @zenith0111 he's right tho
[3:07:57] <VidulaSaix> You need to go to the resistance camp guy in lochs
[3:07:58] <jaysondeez> do knight
[3:07:59] <+dante_must_die_exe> The FFXIV stans coming out PogChamp
[3:08:05] <+DreyfussFrost> If Minh did NG+ he would have to play through all the quests again
[3:08:12] <%CourtOfFamine> new segment : get got into MMOs
[3:08:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> There's also just watching the cutscene too
[3:08:20] <zenith0111> I also ay this game and no lol
[3:08:30] <Louie_Salmon> If the KotR raid is ready we could do that first
[3:08:42] <Jashter18> Could Minh switch to his alt if he hasn't done it there?
[3:08:53] <InXplotch> god, minh would use the violently blue menus
[3:08:53] <+blue_cloak552> to just watch the cutscene is in the inn
[3:08:55] <%OctopusLantern> OctopusLantern subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months!
[3:09:00] <VidulaSaix> Seems like you might not have the option anymore
[3:09:07] <EL_TRO> did minh run ruby weapon?
[3:09:09] <VidulaSaix> It might vanish after you beat Diamond
[3:09:18] <+ActiveLink> Maybe the guy who unlocks extreme mode?
[3:09:29] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that all sounds like how I think it is
[3:09:32] <+OblivionSword1> Is it not a trial ?
[3:09:32] <DatAsuna> Multiple versions
[3:09:37] <+QueequegTheater> Sapphire
[3:09:42] <kerazykitsune> sapphire weapon is not a trial
[3:09:42] <Tracazoid> Good old multiverse
[3:09:46] <Louie_Salmon> Because that's when the Arc launches, it can't get any more data after that
[3:09:48] <jaysondeez> you can't fight sapphire
[3:09:50] <VidulaSaix> Yeah I think its gone Minh, sorry
[3:09:51] <kerazykitsune> It is a solo instance

[3:10:01] <zenith0111> TRUE
[3:10:05] <mario_Sif> ruby is from Sazabi
[3:10:06] <@Solidus_113> you have to NG+ for the solo instance, you can't freely replay it
[3:10:14] <jaysondeez> you just can't unless you ng+. you can show him ruby and emerald or diamond after Knights
[3:10:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:10:22] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah, doesn't make them look any prettier, but yes
[3:10:30] <VidulaSaix> @Solidus_113 The practice thing used to still be available but I guess they removed it
[3:10:31] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah the NPC is gone Minh
[3:10:39] <%Rixstarian> I think Minh is confusing replaying as doing it on his alt character
[3:10:45] <+QueequegTheater> NPC is gone, can't do it
[3:10:55] <DatAsuna> I don't count them as the same characters though.
[3:10:58] <+ActiveLink> The cutscene is probably watchable in the Inn room
[3:11:02] <42nfl19> Damn 3 hours late, but since Nier is over, what are we showing off now? FF14 in general?

[3:16:59] <Goraka91> If you play good and skip mechanics i swear to god
[3:17:01] <DatAsuna> Sounds like johns to me Minh :P
[3:17:02] <+MTLxSpider> you gonna kill to fast dont worry
[3:17:03] <%ZweihanderSteve> this min ilvl?
[3:17:11] <+QueequegTheater> Just do 100 Midare's in a row 4Head
[3:17:18] <NeonBleu> This synced?
[3:17:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:17:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ehhhh
[3:17:20] <VidulaSaix> Yes, very
[3:17:22] <+QueequegTheater> Yes
[3:17:24] <+ChrisAlgoo> Nelo Angelo lookin' ass
[3:17:28] <Zebroneath> generally, yes
[3:17:31] <An_Armed_Bear> this fight was particularly easy too
[3:17:32] <Goraka91> There's hard mode versions later
[3:17:32] <AllenDeadman> they usually are... until they get higher difficulties
[3:17:37] <MKII> there are easy versions required to progress. and an optional hard version
[3:17:39] <T_Sasquatch> yes but people still fuck it up LUL
[3:17:42] <Afrosamasenpai> oooo pretty effects
[3:17:42] <+OblivionSword1> oh this is EX huh
[3:17:43] <DatAsuna> raids always come in multiple difficulties
[3:17:50] <KeiganOfAstora> I;m looking at the screen and I have no idea what I'm looking at LUL
[3:17:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> this is regular
[3:17:55] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[3:18:00] <RogueMinja> Wonder if Minh's gonna show Woolie Susano also.
[3:18:02] <+OblivionSword1> ah
[3:18:04] <valriot> This is getting an Ultimate next expansion
[3:18:09] <DuwangLife> thordan ex is so gooood
[3:18:10] <%ChoculaUltra> the last boss of the main story of the initial release of every expansion tends to be a big "can you play your class" check type of boss
[3:18:11] <DatAsuna> ah escaflowne
[3:18:14] <EL_TRO> susano is an awesome fight
[3:18:16] <+ConLin_Arts_> Extreme has a different theme at the start
[3:18:18] <InXplotch> Yes, but they generally offer an optional extreme difficulty that offers good rewards "for their time"
[3:18:24] <EL_TRO> have him fight off sword
[3:18:31] <mistformll> helicopter blade.
[3:18:31] <Dodolo212> samurai pain
[3:18:33] <T_Sasquatch> weird, i dont remember seeing any of this on my first run through
[3:18:36] <%JenovasPuppet> Only tanks get to see anything but the ass of the enemies
[3:18:40] <Jashter18> Woolie would probably like Odin too
[3:18:40] <VidulaSaix> Yes
[3:18:55] <%JenovasPuppet> NO
[3:18:56] <VidulaSaix> SOmetimes
[3:18:57] <+MTLxSpider> NAP
[3:18:57] <BluBox> Not really
[3:18:59] <An_Armed_Bear> eh odin's a bit bland, looks cool though
[3:19:00] <Ziegsy> lb1 is a dps loss
[3:19:01] <+dom3800> I imagine Woolie would like most raid bosses
[3:19:03] <zenith0111> Doing a LB1 will get you hate mail
[3:19:03] <+pissdegaulle> in raids nah
[3:19:04] <VidulaSaix> If you wont get an LB2 or LB3
[3:19:06] <Tukaru> Depends on the content
[3:19:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Also check move names! Tons of references there!
[3:19:16] <%JenovasPuppet> Shit, even LB2 is often a DPS loss
[3:19:17] <RAH001> back in the day i use to actual turn my cam away
[3:19:21] <EL_TRO> show him tsukuyomi
[3:19:23] <Tukaru> It's the cast bar
[3:19:23] <+A_Mighty_Walrus> if it helps you can alter the camera pitch so minh can still look down at the floor but see more of the boss
[3:19:24] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus LB effectiveness goes up exponentially each level
[3:19:24] <DatAsuna> It says normal, but it means easy xD
[3:19:31] <+KawaiiJetty> normal dungeon might as well use LB1 since nobody use LB lol
[3:19:37] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[3:19:39] <T_Sasquatch> guys, We can't just show woolie all the trials in the game LUL
[3:19:45] <blue6sub6remnant6> As a person who has not played XIV, that number font is very Final Fantasy Dissidia, though that makes sense, since this is a Final Fantasy game.
[3:19:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> uuuuh
[3:19:50] <VidulaSaix> Hes been casting it every time a knight shows up
[3:19:50] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus in dungeons it can be useful, but in boss fights it's rarely ever worth using
[3:19:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> HERE IT COMES
[3:19:56] <Ziegsy> Id love for wollie to see the hades fight just for the music
[3:19:59] <BluBox> Sometimes
[3:20:00] <%JenovasPuppet> Sometimes!
[3:20:00] <VidulaSaix> Its complicated
[3:20:00] <+SunnyVarietyPack> some cases
[3:20:02] <+QueequegTheater> Kind of
[3:20:02] <Tukaru> It's story importnat and kind of
[3:20:03] <jaysondeez> kinda
[3:20:04] <2DSuperiority> Primals are BAD
[3:20:05] <adithehella> one method
[3:20:08] <VidulaSaix> No, those are different
[3:20:08] <%dirkfunk1> ysale
[3:20:09] <%ZweihanderSteve> it comples LUL
[3:20:11] <+Arnschen> Those are also in this
[3:20:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It's a case by case basis
[3:20:12] <jaysondeez> primals are false gods mostly
[3:20:14] <townzzzzz> da boyz
[3:20:15] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Shiva is a transform
[3:20:16] <Thepothero> Ehhh kinda
[3:20:17] <oceanmatt> shiva
[3:20:18] <AllenDeadman> there is both, summons and transforming
[3:20:18] <+MTLxSpider> Except shiva
[3:20:29] <Violent_Senpai> primals are basically magical nukes fueled by crystals
[3:20:42] <zenith0111> At high level MMO plays things just happen lol
[3:20:43] <InXplotch> that is one of the ways, but generally other means are used to bring about the summons
[3:20:43] <Ziegsy> Having a person as a base for the primal/summon makes it cost less ather/crystals.
[3:20:44] <Violent_Senpai> that can brainwash people
[3:20:53] <VidulaSaix> Basically if they were a real person like Shiva you can become them but if they were an actual Diety like Ifrit, they're just monsters
[3:20:57] <+MTLxSpider> LUL
[3:21:00] <JanusII> This is two expansions back is why.
[3:21:00] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It's not reversible, either, once you become a summon (called a primal in XIV) you as a person are dead
[3:21:02] <InXplotch> most you just pray into existence
[3:21:04] <Tukaru> Mostly they are just brought into form by magic, but sometimes a living person invokes the form
[3:21:06] <+pissdegaulle> you can summon anything as long as you have faith and a shitton of aether
[3:21:08] <%JenovasPuppet> Everyone is meant to be able to clear this fight to complete the story, so it's way easier.
[3:21:11] <Applecannon63> Is that what Icons from the upcoming FFXVI are based off of?
[3:21:11] <%DiaDiaDiamond> the process is base on imgination you could summon the Baz if wanted
[3:21:21] <+MTLxSpider> also yokataro wanted more mechanics that would kill everyone. but ff14 team said no.
[3:21:24] <PyroBluPhoenix> Is this synced Ex?
[3:21:28] <+QueequegTheater> @Applecannon63 almost certainly
[3:21:32] <zenith0111> Not EX
[3:21:36] <%JenovasPuppet> @PyroBluPhoenix Nah, just story mode
[3:21:37] <PyroBluPhoenix> Ah okay

[3:21:38] <Tukaru> Bladedance is the melee LB2
[3:21:40] <Ziegsy> @PyroBluPhoenix nah its normal
[3:21:41] <%czeekytv> @SkellyVee hey thanks for the gift sub :)
[3:21:42] <Thepothero> @woolieversus you need a large amount of aether/spirit power to summon say ifirt
[3:21:46] <Goraka91> @Applecannon63 Probably, though it seems to be more of a junchuuriki situation
[3:22:05] <PyroBluPhoenix> @Ziegsy Just seems like it's taking longer than normal is all XD
[3:22:10] <An_Armed_Bear> This is almost as long as the summon animation in 7
[3:22:13] <Tukaru> meteor timers
[3:22:16] <+skylerpilot> Yeah summons in 14 are entirely faith based, as on as you believe in it hard enough and have enough Aether it can happen
[3:22:19] <Ziegsy> @PyroBluPhoenix Might be MINE
[3:22:24] <+QueequegTheater> MonkaS
[3:22:26] <+QueequegTheater> monkaS
[3:22:28] <VidulaSaix> YEYEYE
[3:22:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> ULTIMATE END
[3:22:30] <An_Armed_Bear> ULTIMATE END
[3:22:33] <VidulaSaix> Moon? LUL
[3:22:33] <Thepothero> Oh and pure faith too the primal to summon it
[3:22:40] <%JenovasPuppet> Scroll lock lol
[3:22:47] <2DSuperiority> 0 0 0 0 dmg LUL
[3:22:54] <Tukaru> So this is the raid wipe mechanic

[3:23:01] <An_Armed_Bear> "MASAKA"
[3:23:04] <Tukaru> If you failed earlier that would kill you
[3:23:07] <PyroBluPhoenix> @Ziegsy MINE?
[3:23:12] <VidulaSaix> Its extremely old content
[3:23:15] <+fugatlas> oh my lord, the least oppritune eye scratch of all time
[3:23:16] <%JenovasPuppet> Super outgeared
[3:23:19] <Ziegsy> @PyroBluPhoenix Minimum item level, no echo
[3:23:20] <+pissdegaulle> he cant believe he fucked up so he's just flailing around lmao
[3:23:20] <Explodincatz> and your going
[3:23:21] <passserby> neat
[3:23:23] <+MTLxSpider> panic swing.
[3:23:23] <%democrazyyy> and he freaks out that you survived it
[3:23:27] <PyroBluPhoenix> @Ziegsy Ah okay I see
[3:23:33] <DatAsuna> F
[3:23:33] <PyroBluPhoenix> That would make sense XD
[3:23:38] <dds333a> He CAN'T believe it
[3:23:43] <GunstarContra> Canonically it's just you.
[3:23:45] <T_Sasquatch> BITCH YOU THOUGHT
[3:23:46] <AllenDeadman> this game is a love letter to FF games all round
[3:23:46] <+Masutasodo> Story wise you're here by yourself
[3:23:48] <+Mountaindrewdle> The best part of this fight is that he flails around desperately after that attack
[3:23:50] <%democrazyyy> @woolieversus canonically you solo this encounter storywise
[3:23:51] <VidulaSaix> EVIL POPE
[3:23:52] <+pissdegaulle> canonically this fight is solo i believe
[3:23:52] <+Arnschen> OH, THIS BIT

[3:24:06] <AllenDeadman> fuck you pope
[3:24:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah, this is what sets the WoL from, woah he's pretty strong, to, WHAT THE FUCK, WHO ARE YOU

[3:46:17] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus unironically would be original because elves are super rare as a player race
[3:46:17] <%SkellyVee> dejavu8Love
[3:46:23] <stormhawk9891> Elezen are an endangered species in NA
[3:46:24] <+QueequegTheater> @JenovasPuppet well it IS Woolie after all
[3:46:24] <Robot_Nixon_> face presets DansGame
[3:46:28] <BrachyZoid> Eyebrows jawline and nose can be changed on each
[3:46:39] <+Aeriqui> as a fellow black femroe @woolieversus is making my soul sing
[3:46:43] <%democrazyyy> @woolieversus each of the 4 faces has slightly different "facial features" options further down
[3:46:47] <zenith0111> @inxplotch Now that you mention it youre hella right
[3:46:58] <DatAsuna> the mass effect CaC episode is gonna be pretty funny by comparison
[3:47:02] <zenith0111> Elves are super popular everywhere else too
[3:47:13] <VidulaSaix> @DatAsuna Did he say he was playing that?
[3:47:16] <+ChrisAlgoo> purble
[3:47:22] <dds333a> I AM ANGRY
[3:47:23] <brunoberserk> FF Darli Dagger
[3:47:25] <%democrazyyy> honestly this character looks pretty rad already

[3:47:35] <Tukaru> 2013 mmo
[3:47:36] <RAH001> ah. i thought he was gonna change it to unit 1 colors
[3:47:40] <VidulaSaix> @DatAsuna Been missing it I guess. Rad.

[3:47:52] <%keiji_maede> War?
[3:48:06] <%PatStaresAt> wait are they actually making a character for real whats going on
[3:48:09] <muXPerience> she looks like she's got heart
[3:48:10] <Robot_Nixon_> DansGame character creators that still mould decent looking avatars. I wanna make horrible DS monsters 😡
[3:48:11] <+Hollow_Mirage> I come back and Woolie is making a Character???
[3:48:13] <DatAsuna> @VidulaSaix Well it won't be till after V's back, and probably after yakuza 0, so a long time from now.
[3:48:16] <+QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Yes, keep up old man
[3:48:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PatStaresAt yeah for real
[3:48:21] <VidulaSaix> @DatAsuna Figured as much
[3:48:22] <%PatStaresAt> I was out of the house!
[3:48:24] <Thepothero> @PatStaresAt I dont know but im confused too
[3:48:25] <monkaSol> Let him sink in Pat LUL
[3:48:27] <+Hollow_Mirage> Is it a character or a NPC for like Housing
[3:48:28] <%democrazyyy> @patstaresat they showed off knights of the round and went into character creator
[3:48:30] <+dujam> hope character creation gets an update someday, its pretty weak
[3:48:31] <+SouLucha> Did Mihn just go "wololo"
[3:48:31] <olaksi> woolie just make an account
[3:48:35] <@mothmandraws> clearly thordon impressed him so much
[3:48:39] <@mothmandraws> but nah think hes just testing
[3:48:39] <+zuzuxiv> what the hell is woolie being indoctrinated
[3:48:40] <BrachyZoid> lunarSmug
[3:48:41] <Applecannon63> Mittopia has an insane Character creation
[3:48:41] <@Solidus_113> get that heterochromia going
[3:48:45] <danraven> Woolsworth <The Perfect Legend>
[3:48:45] <DatAsuna> go red for big edge
[3:48:51] <%PatStaresAt> If you guys think woolie is actually gunna play 14 you are all mad
[3:48:52] <%JenovasPuppet> Do you want some of that HETEROCHROMIA
[3:48:53] <Thepothero> im hype af for this tho
[3:48:59] <+QueequegTheater> The Rise of AsmonWoolie begins TODAY
[3:49:02] <VidulaSaix> Dont worry Woolie, some of us white people dont notice either LUL
[3:49:02] <T_Sasquatch> :( I hate it
[3:49:07] <dds333a> Brown or black?
[3:49:09] <Tenkay> We wanted to show him Brute Justice but he went into the CC
[3:49:09] <+Rafraud> I mean some black people have green eyes
[3:49:11] <rei0> i would like for woolie to try ffxiv honestly
[3:49:11] <+Rafraud> But yeah
[3:49:13] <+OblivionSword1> Asian doesn't care about eye color as well
[3:49:16] <dds333a> whatcha want?
[3:49:27] <Applecannon63> HETEROCHROMIA FTW
[3:49:30] <%Skullgod> moon2DOIT
[3:49:32] <+Metballs> I don't even know MY eye colour
[3:49:37] <dds333a> Oh, I'm sorry, you got HAZEL
[3:49:37] <%Double_Tap_That> Give her the sharingan
[3:49:40] <Tukaru> Odd Eyes also allows for Heterochromia
[3:49:43] <DatAsuna> and for some reason he goes after the white actress
[3:49:49] <+QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Keep saying he won't, maybe Crazy Talk can help out
[3:49:50] <%MisterRockett> WAIT WHAT'S HAPPENING
[3:49:50] <%JenovasPuppet> Please don't actually go heterochromia >_<
[3:49:59] <T_Sasquatch> I cannot take heterochromia seriously anymore LUL

[3:50:11] <DSD24> Those noses are cool
[3:50:19] <%democrazyyy> big schnozz
[3:50:20] <Applecannon63> Heterochromia so you can become cat
[3:50:20] <zenith0111> Woolie is like 3 confirm buttons away from playing FF14
[3:50:22] <Goraka91> Big nose for a big woman
[3:50:23] <+OblivionSword1> BIG STRONG NOSE
[3:50:24] <olaksi> I really don't like hellsguard nose options, otherwise A+
[3:50:25] <VidulaSaix> LUL

[3:50:51] <Robot_Nixon_> max all features atpRtsd
[3:50:53] <Tukaru> We looked at G-Warrior, but the Solo Duty is not replayable
[3:50:53] <+QueequegTheater> @Neoripo yes, but apparently you can't replay the instance anymore so it was just the display
[3:50:53] <VidulaSaix> Click them
[3:50:55] <+mikesapartment> you have to actually toggle it
[3:50:58] <@Solidus_113> select it
[3:50:59] <%JenovasPuppet> You have to select that one to see it
[3:51:00] <PyroBluPhoenix> you need to actually click on it
[3:51:00] <%PatStaresAt> Poor Woolz, instant gravitation to the race/gender combo with sub 1% of the playerbase
[3:51:04] <PyroBluPhoenix> to see the difference
[3:51:07] <%saiko2208> Wait I come back and Woolie is making a character ?!?
[3:51:07] <+Aeriqui> @misterrockett the greatest TEAM
[3:51:09] <VidulaSaix> You have to actually click them to check @WoolieVersus
[3:51:09] <Applecannon63> If cats and dogs can have heterochromia why not any race?

[3:51:47] <Tukaru> @PatStaresAt Did you expect Woolie not to pick the musclebound woman type?
[3:51:48] <PyroBluPhoenix> Heads up though the lip color will look weird in some cutscenes xD
[3:51:49] <TheAntitype> FEMROE GANG
[3:51:55] <+Aeriqui> there are dozens of us! dozens!
[3:52:02] <Robot_Nixon_> advanced race theorists in chat atpCap

[3:52:09] <Ziegsy> mascara
[3:52:10] <+Aeriqui> okay like a dozen
[3:52:11] <%democrazyyy> @woolieversus each face option has different scar options
[3:52:13] <Dragon_Batman> I mean Femroe pretty dope tho
[3:52:14] <+QueequegTheater> I prefer Sea Wolves for the inhuman skin colors, but otherwise pretty much picked the same
[3:52:17] <olaksi> I'm glad woolie chose a roe, truly a man of sophistication
[3:52:18] <TheAntitype> my twitter bio says "femroe evangelist" this is making my day
[3:52:22] <+DreyfussFrost> Beauty mark
[3:52:22] <@Solidus_113> mole
[3:52:23] <%MisterRockett> @Aeriqui lol
[3:52:25] <%Afterman_> thats a beauty mark
[3:52:26] <+Rafraud> I mean if anything this shows how far some char creators have come in terms of darker skin characters
[3:52:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:52:27] <Tenkay> beauty mark next to eye
[3:52:28] <%commanderclaw> "Your female character must be pretty!"
[3:52:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Beauty Mark
[3:52:30] <PyroBluPhoenix> beauty mark
[3:52:31] <+Rafraud> But christ lmfao
[3:52:31] <Srthunda> beauty mark by the eye
[3:52:35] <+Arnschen> @WoolieVersus So these Facial Features are different for every race and even between clans. Sometimes they'll add facial hair, tattoos, or beauty marks as well.
[3:52:40] <Applecannon63> You think Woolie is only into Punchgirls?
[3:52:42] <BrachyZoid> it's a mole
[3:52:42] <%MisterRockett> @commanderclaw And she is!
[3:52:42] <+KawaiiJetty> Sea Wolves for different nose too but both are fine
[3:52:44] <%HeroToxiko> hot grrrl summer HAS BEGUN
[3:52:44] <+DreyfussFrost> The thumbnail shows the feature
[3:52:47] <T_Sasquatch> I play a femroe and im a monk main, I am the 0.1%
[3:52:48] <+DreyfussFrost> You need to look from the same angle
[3:52:48] <BrachyZoid> Covered by hair
[3:52:50] <%Afterman_> hidden by a dread
[3:52:53] <%JenovasPuppet> The beauty mark is behind the dreads
[3:52:53] <WakeUpThrow> I'm still sad that Sea Wolf roes don't have blue skin options
[3:52:54] <+blue_cloak552> They are diffrent between faces
[3:52:56] <dds333a> I just wanna put a vote for beauty mark TearGlove
[3:52:59] <+Aeriqui> @t_sasquatch hell yeahh
[3:53:05] <dds333a> Can't get enough of them
[3:53:08] <exnuart> anime scar
[3:53:13] <+QueequegTheater> It's not quite Fallout 4's scar customization
[3:53:14] <%JenovasPuppet> Different faces have different scars
[3:53:18] <%MisterRockett> This is gonna be where we are for the rest of the game.
[3:53:20] <%czeekytv> Freckles are "face paint" smh
[3:53:31] <+QueequegTheater> Man, FO4 has so many scars and you can fade them out
[3:53:36] <DSD24> Amalur had piercings too
[3:53:38] <+QueequegTheater> It's great
[3:53:40] <VidulaSaix> BACK IN
[3:53:40] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> I had to give myself tattoos on my eyebrows to make em look bushy enough XD
[3:53:40] <IntenseNerdRage> I can't believe Woolie is finally going to play Ff14, the award winning mmo with a free trail that lets you play up to level 60, which includes the first and most acclaimed expansion Heavensward
[3:53:41] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus if you would prefer to not have the dark mark on the nose thats the biggest difference between the two variants
[3:53:46] <TheLeadingTone> NARUTO PogChamp
[3:53:54] <dbag202> EDGY
[3:53:56] <%Afterman_> i think with the one next to the 3 slashes
[3:53:57] <@Solidus_113> MR FACE
[3:53:59] <%Afterman_> i went with*
[3:53:59] <DatAsuna> I didn't expect a KoA:R reference
[3:54:01] <+Arnschen> MR FACE
[3:54:02] <monkaSol> mr face LUL
[3:54:04] <dds333a> TWEWY cmonBruh

[3:54:08] <Tukaru> Ms. Face
[3:54:13] <Ris_Eltrut> Mr Face tdogWat
[3:54:16] <%JenovasPuppet> NEW FACE, NEW FACE, NEW NEW NEW FACE
[3:54:16] <jaysondeez> ashy larry
[3:54:17] <+KawaiiJetty> freckles as paint smh
[3:54:21] <PyroBluPhoenix> Cute
[3:54:31] <Explodincatz> Woolie u look like a villain character
[3:54:40] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh god the only thing more generic then heterochromia is freckles
[3:54:42] <%SveriSageAdvice> you can use Light to make it more skin-toned
[3:54:44] <Ziegsy> What kind of washing liguid does naruto use? Datte Non-bayo
[3:54:45] <Robot_Nixon_> almost AYAYA anime
[3:54:51] <exnuart> full dark looks best on the freckles
[3:54:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> used the black
[3:54:54] <Applecannon63> But Freckles are good tho
[3:54:58] <Neoripo> lol
[3:55:00] <MacMog> just checked in, Elezen?
[3:55:02] <Supwizy> you can go half black face
[3:55:04] <exnuart> go full black
[3:55:06] <%Afterman_> @JenovasPuppet as someone who always uses heterochromia for their characters i feel attacked
[3:55:06] <Applecannon63> why is that generic?
[3:55:08] <+QueequegTheater> @MacMog femroe
[3:55:12] <Srthunda> agreed
[3:55:17] <%dirkfunk1> true
[3:55:18] <VidulaSaix> The creator is in desperate need of an update
[3:55:19] <DSD24> Code Vein was a good character creator too
[3:55:20] <Tukaru> This is looking like a background Ninja from the hidden lightning village
[3:55:22] <dds333a> @applecannon63 TPFufun agreed
[3:55:25] <InXplotch> the color you need is not hte one you would expect
[3:55:25] <VidulaSaix> For its time it was good but now its severely lacking
[3:55:29] <+KawaiiJetty> they are but feel so limited to have on face paint section instead of tattoo/faciL features
[3:55:31] <+bluedude153> Not purple enough ;-;
[3:55:34] <InXplotch> it's weird how it works, try pure black
[3:55:35] <MacMog> @queequegtheater oh yes, should’ve known from the shape of the eyes
[3:55:42] <@Menitta> Code Vein was an awesome character creator with bonus Souls game
[3:55:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> Light pure black was what i used for my dark skinned character
[3:55:45] <T_Sasquatch> atleast he didnt pick a race with ONLY 4 FACES
[3:55:47] <T_Sasquatch> FUCK
[3:55:49] <+Jakeofalco> @WoolieVersus rotate the character
[3:55:49] <+yukichocomilk> freckles are cute, let people do what they want
[3:55:50] <zenith0111> @jenovaspuppet It was generic on deviant art but its only stuck to special eye powers nowadays
[3:55:50] <%JenovasPuppet> Alright I'll admit those freckles look pretty good
[3:55:55] <%commanderclaw> This whole game is a little cliche
[3:56:03] <monkaSol> Yeah its very limited to its presets
[3:56:03] <Ziegsy> @Menitta I loved running around in that game as a giant hat
[3:56:03] <+KawaiiJetty> Code Vein character creator was fun
[3:56:05] <+donpatrondx> the other clan has different scars
[3:56:07] <DSD24> @Menitta I just wish they added more clothing options instead of just accessories
[3:56:09] <Velyndra> ps3 limitations
[3:56:11] <TheAntitype> you can pry my freckles from my cold dead hands
[3:56:12] <zenith0111> Characters are rarely heterochromatic without some extra bs
[3:56:16] <Supwizy> Nioh 2 is insane
[3:56:17] <Dragon_Batman> I imagine it is age that holds that back yea
[3:56:17] <InXplotch> voice is both the most and least important option here
[3:56:20] <monkaSol> BDO is more advanced in regards to character creation
[3:56:23] <dds333a> CV only really had a CC, other than that there'z not much
[3:56:30] <rosemon5001> @WoolieVersus yea jump force has that
[3:56:32] <+Aeriqui> nioh 2 creator is goated
[3:56:32] <Valdorick> CHOOSE! Freckles or Tattoos
[3:56:38] <+vitoxxi> pso2 seem like it has a better character creator
[3:56:41] <TheAntitype> Woolie test it on all expressions
[3:56:44] <Goraka91> Voices are weird, you don't get a combat preview and some are sure uh, something
[3:56:51] <DatAsuna> lewd
[3:56:53] <%JenovasPuppet> Ikuuuuu~
[3:56:54] <DSD24> Man this outfit is cool
[3:56:54] <+AnActualHermitCrab> lewd
[3:56:59] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus The laugh gives the best idea of the voice.

[3:57:36] <+QueequegTheater> @MisterRockett 60
[3:57:37] <dds333a> The gap moe demands you give her a high pitched voice
[3:57:40] <Goraka91> @JenovasPuppet Not Highlander animated doe
[3:57:45] <Thepothero> type 4 catgirl
[3:57:48] <%dirkfunk1> i wish i could pick one from each column
[3:57:56] <+Aeriqui> FEMROE TYPE 10 VOICE LETS GO
[3:57:57] <@mothmandraws> I miss old viera voice
[3:57:58] <+OblivionSword1> it's finne
[3:58:03] <Tukaru> So this is mostly important because your character makes voice grunts in combat constantly
[3:58:04] <InXplotch> the biggest shame is you dont hear combat grunts, which is the sound you hear the most often when you play
[3:58:07] <+Metballs> @MisterRockett Only like 60, femroes can get nuts
[3:58:10] <JanusII> It's more about your outfit later.
[3:58:10] <%Afterman_> yea it needs a bit of a polish
[3:58:11] <%commanderclaw> It's almost a decade old, hopefully it gets updated soon
[3:58:12] <Ziegsy> @mothmandraws V O I C E 7
[3:58:12] <%MisterRockett> It's MOSTLY about dressing them up.
[3:58:12] <%thetunnelhomer> Job clothes!
[3:58:13] <+SouLucha> It's never enough..
[3:58:13] <InXplotch> @mothmandraws voice 7 taken too soon
[3:58:16] <DianaTheAscian> Damn I'm late as hell
[3:58:16] <@Solidus_113> you can choose
[3:58:19] <+OdysseyKnight> There's facial animations
[3:58:20] <monkaSol> just wear a helmet 4Head
[3:58:21] <IntenseNerdRage> Now play the game
[3:58:21] <+DreyfussFrost> They will. In-game cutscenes show your face often.
[3:58:22] <VidulaSaix> You can choose
[3:58:22] <verscoll> You do get to unlock more hairstyles eventually
[3:58:23] <OkamiDude15> for a base 2013 CC its alright
[3:58:23] <zenith0111> Lots of zoom ins
[3:58:23] <+bluedude153> you can keep your helmet on
[3:58:25] <+MTLxSpider> yes
[3:58:26] <%PatStaresAt> @WoolieVersus 95% of your character customization will be your clothes
[3:58:27] <DatAsuna> You saw many cutscenes with helmet on
[3:58:27] <Thepothero> yes
[3:58:28] <WakeUpThrow> yep
[3:58:28] <Tukaru> Helmet display is a toggle
[3:58:28] <+QueequegTheater> Yes
[3:58:28] <+SunnyVarietyPack> yes
[3:58:30] <+KisukeOboro> It's serviceable enough, but it could be better
[3:58:31] <+AnActualHermitCrab> The real meat is when you can mix it with gear/dyes. You'll never find a character that looks exactly like yours.
[3:58:32] <DatAsuna> There is but you gotta turn it on
[3:58:33] <+MTLxSpider> Cosmetic is end game. raid? fk that.
[3:58:34] <zenith0111> They zoom in on the party quite a lot
[3:58:34] <%JenovasPuppet> There aren't that many options, but you can still make a character that feels like it's YOUR character.
[3:58:34] <MacMog> 90% of the time you don’t see the details, yeah
[3:58:35] <Saltmeisterr> this ain't no Miitopia editor
[3:58:36] <InXplotch> I really wish it was better
[3:58:41] <+yukichocomilk> mods solve everything
[3:58:42] <Ks201> You can turn of helms
[3:58:42] <+KawaiiJetty> could be better but passable
[3:58:43] <%MisterRockett> @MisterRockett Oh I know. My fem roe is meant to be set for MAXIMUM INTIMEDATION. Tallest possible with 100 breasticals.
[3:58:44] <JanusII> Comment: Woolie Bait
[3:58:45] <monkaSol> RP data LUL
[3:58:46] <KahnWick> oh hold up, woolie's trying XIV now!?
[3:58:46] <Goraka91> Now the WEIRD SHIT
[3:58:46] <Tukaru> You can also glamour helmets if you like a specific hat
[3:58:48] <InXplotch> yes, they do get close
[3:58:48] <+A_Mighty_Walrus> there's also a /visor emote for some helmets to move the visor around
[3:58:49] <Thepothero> i dont like most of the helmets in 14
[3:58:51] <exnuart> viera and hrothgar dont have to hide their helmets, they just dont get one
[3:58:55] <+QueequegTheater> LET'S GOOOO
[3:58:58] <+MTLxSpider> 12 months
[3:58:59] <Tukaru> This has no actual gameplay impact
[3:59:00] <zenith0111> I HAVE NO IDEA
[3:59:02] <Thepothero> they fuck up your hair
[3:59:06] <+MTLxSpider> I wish we had 32
[3:59:09] <olaksi> Choosing Azeyma not knowing anything about the plot was my best RNG roll to date
[3:59:09] <%democrazyyy> he's getting so much farther than i thought he would
[3:59:11] <%MisterRockett> Wait did that say the 32nd????
[3:59:12] <VidulaSaix> MENPHINA OR BUST
[3:59:14] <monkaSol> LUL now comes the real RPers in chat
[3:59:15] <+DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus These choices mean NOTHING. They're purely for roleplay.
[3:59:15] <Tukaru> Halone is THE FURY
[3:59:18] <snow_soldier> Oschon bois REP
[3:59:19] <+AnActualHermitCrab> @JenovasPuppet That's what I'm saying. Even if you find somebody with the same face type (I use the most popular Viera face, LOL), there's so much you can do that sets your WoL apart from theirs.

[4:01:51] <Zeldrick> It's so dumb
[4:01:52] <MKII> because she needs to absorb sunlight and water
[4:01:52] <CoffeeSlice> her abs are harder than the armor
[4:01:54] <JanusII> Yeah if there was like a window toggle.
[4:01:56] <DukeBlack_> THey fight gods this armor means shit
[4:01:56] <Zeif00> THis is for both Male and Female

[4:02:11] <brunoberserk> '' STAB ME HERE ''
[4:02:13] <JanusII> Yeah you can cover up like a tin can.
[4:02:13] <InXplotch> The male version of this armor is WAY better and it pisses me off
[4:02:13] <%MisterRockett> These are the level 50 outfits and you don't actually end up wearing these outside of glamor cause you get a better side with a special currency.
[4:02:15] <+yukichocomilk> I just want cute armor LUL
[4:02:15] <%siegstorms> siegstorms subscribed with Prime.
[4:02:15] <2DSuperiority> lala tummy
[4:02:22] <+DreyfussFrost> So unfortunately when FF14 adds new jobs in expansions, you can't start as them. So the character creator only has the original set of jobs, which is now less than half of what's in the game.
[4:02:23] <zenith0111> Ummm...

[4:02:27] <JanusII> I wouldn't wear the male version of this tbh.
[4:02:29] <%MisterRockett> There's some DOPE fem heavy armor.
[4:02:29] <monkaSol> Dudes get bikinis, chicks get buff
[4:02:29] <Lancaster_H> what if your abs are stronger than armour tho
[4:02:30] <+blue_cloak552> This is only armor that does that
[4:02:35] <DSD24> Archer looks fancy
[4:02:39] <%andrewofbob> Male skimpy armour or gtfo
