[0:02:56] <%Totally_Not_Toby> just got a LoU2 ad LUL
[0:02:58] <%ringabal> This means Reggie is on his own epic adventures offscreen that we'll never experience.

[0:03:01] <%democrazyyy> what about ice mario
[0:03:01] <@Solidus_113> White and Green is always a crisp look. A lot of my Warframes have it
[0:03:03] <glass_marcus> white and green is 100% the best color combo
[0:03:05] <derap41> Mario Stole his look with the fireflower
[0:03:07] <%dinnydanny777> Luigi is clean anyway
[0:03:08] <%Josef_Stryker> Fireflower gear is such a good aesthetic

[0:09:30] <Papa_Bearman> Could someone help me out with terminology? What is a "stand," and where does it come from?
[0:09:39] <%Irridium> @Josef_Stryker bro right there with you. Been having so much fun with the rework
[0:09:52] <%Proxzo> uni500 Love that you're streaming this game. There is SO MUCH in this game. Shocking amount of content. BTW don't sweat too much about the action commands. Later you'll get a badge that'll help you train.

[0:10:10] <Pechugaman> let's goooo
[0:10:10] <%gatorafan> The Phantom Top Tier
[0:10:18] <derap41> Kotal is still a bitch
[0:10:29] <NotHereToStream> jobber kahn
[0:10:44] <derap41> Doesn't Matter how good he is as a fighter Kotal is always a bitch
[0:10:48] <CyrusVGZ> I'd love a Shinobi game by the SOR4 crew.
[0:10:53] <+gutlesscoward> I hope kotal comes back in a wheelchair
[0:10:56] <%SirGO0SE> they started in a bad state with Katalina
[0:11:04] <%Irridium> Kotal gets a wheelchair install
[0:11:06] <%SirGO0SE> she was so powerful out of the gate
[0:11:28] <%ringabal> Developers really out there saying "YOU DIDN'T WIN"
[0:11:30] <%SirGO0SE> same with Gran and Ferry tbh
[0:11:34] <@akuda_bar> oh shit i'm late
[0:11:41] <%GrassCannon> They nerfed Weiss's 5P recovery and it killed my favorite Weiss/Yukiko CC route FeelsBadMan
[0:11:50] <Ghostbody> @sirgo0se you mean the timbs?
[0:11:58] <%SirGO0SE> and Ferry is a tough nerf because her kit is just powerful
[0:12:00] <YoTobimoto> katalina was DUMB
[0:12:18] <rsg220> fucking jago and his hp recovery goddamn it....but that wasn't the real issue
[0:12:24] <%SirGO0SE> the timbs are strong af, its corner push its stupid
[0:12:31] <%SirGO0SE> it ends neutral on 1 interaction
[0:12:51] <%Josef_Stryker> It definitely hurts when a good character is nerfed but they go overboard such as what they recently did to Warlord way back in the day in For Honor
[0:13:00] <+Grayhammatter> @akuda_bar not that late
[0:13:08] <%Josef_Stryker> Not recently
[0:13:14] <%gatorafan> Moral of the story: never listen to chat Kappa
[0:13:19] <%SirGO0SE> but with Granblue, if i was running that game, rather than nerf the top tiers I'd give mobility to the rest of the cast

[0:17:18] <%Proxzo> Super Paper Mario is the FF7 remake of paper mario combat heheh.
[0:17:18] <Darren716> Super Paper is the best in the series, ill die on this hill
[0:17:18] <+Dimfish> super is an alright game, but definitely worse than ttyd. After super its all downhill
[0:17:19] <%DatAsuna> Mowz also gucci
[0:17:19] <VideoGameMobes> I love big ttyds
[0:17:19] <Papa_Bearman> Vivian, the trans ally.

[0:17:51] <%DatAsuna> Safe story, unsafe gameplay

[0:18:24] <%dinnydanny777> @kralec Thank you for the sub by the way
[0:18:24] <%StarMechV> color splash has better characterization but the gameplay still sucks
[0:18:26] <Solidnick18> hi punch mom
[0:18:28] <Am_Shigar00> Color Splash is a massive improvement on SS, but it's still the same formula.

[1:50:47] <%Hawk_Rush> good job!
[1:50:50] <+Dimfish> HP is worthless
[1:50:53] <Kyphen15> If im not mistaken the highest badge cost is 12 bp
[1:50:56] <%cdrom321> There are badges that increase HP and FP by five so they can supliment low HP and FP until you max BP and start leveling HP/FP.
[1:50:57] <%Hawk_Rush> PauseChamp ....
[1:50:57] <%kralec> @rcand9 they ramp up, there are some stupid expensive badges, and also some stackable passive badges. BP is super important.

[1:51:01] <Papa_Bearman> HP is the lame run. I tried an all-HP run once and it was SO boring.

[1:52:47] <%kralec> @rcand9 yeah, early on you don't really get enough badges and FP is more useful. But by chapter 4-5-ish the badges really open up. There are some HP up bades to, so you aren't stuck at 10hp evene if you don't take hp.

[1:55:02] <thelovingfool> woolie shut up Titan Fall on steam
[1:55:06] <Manmush> still probably requires you to have origin
[1:55:06] <bbblaketwitching> there's no hints for those
[1:55:16] <%SouLucha> You can always ask chat about them, they have good shit.
[1:55:22] <ThePizzaLovingTurtle> TF2's better than TF2 tho
[1:55:23] <bbblaketwitching> And they're EVERYWHERE
[1:55:24] <GenericSoda> @abnormalvoid wait who? I rememberthe one in 64 but not here. is it V?
[1:55:25] <+Grayhammatter> goombella's stylish for the bonk is so tight
[1:55:31] <%SirGO0SE> i want TF2-2
[1:55:31] <SixthSun2> There is a badge later on that shows when to do stylish inputs
[1:55:32] <%GrassCannon> You mean "Pickle Stone" chat?
[1:55:37] <bevyrage> @bbblaketwitching hit the ground with the hammer, the hidden floor tiles will pop up if you're close enough
[1:55:37] <+ThatChainmecha> which pokemon game is this
[1:55:37] <bbblaketwitching> And have star peices
[1:55:39] <+AbnormalVoid> @GenericSoda jermaRat
[1:55:41] <+RealThiele> PickleFall
[1:55:44] <+FluffiTamamo> I never thought Woolie would play a paper mario. Whaddyaknow.
[1:55:48] <Solidnick18> good job murphy
[1:55:52] <bbblaketwitching> WRONG
[1:55:53] <Am_Shigar00> Nice
[1:55:58] <+kapcommunist> nice neutral jump
[1:55:58] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[1:55:58] <bbblaketwitching> RIGHT
[1:55:59] <BreakersAweigh> PogChamp
[1:56:00] <%Hawk_Rush> SLEEPING
[1:56:00] <%ringabal> Except the sanbags are STEEL WEIGHTS
[1:56:02] <%lotharrio> Multibounce!
[1:56:04] <CursedNobleman> @ThatChainmecha its Advance Wars 3
[1:56:06] <+CaptainPyron> Not read enough.
[1:56:07] <Treuan> Threw that shit before I walked in the room
[1:56:08] <+dmtjinni> PogChamp
[1:56:09] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[1:56:09] <+Grayhammatter> SLEEPING
[1:56:11] <%ozmon> Parfait
[1:56:12] <+desfore> Nice!
[1:56:13] <+pectusumbra> they are stage lights, not weights
[1:56:14] <bbblaketwitching> It requires ground pound to acquire tho
[1:56:16] <%GrassCannon> Smort
[1:56:16] <StuffHunter> Woolie getting that timing down!
[1:56:16] <JetpackMcQuack> They don't stand a chance
[1:56:24] <%SirGO0SE> POPPIN OFF
[1:56:25] <bbblaketwitching> Which is what I thought you meant
[1:56:29] <GenericSoda> @abnormalvoid that emote means nothing to me but I remembered
[1:56:30] <%lotharrio> It seems to stun them.
[1:56:31] <bbblaketwitching> true tho
[1:56:36] <+AbnormalVoid> llol
[1:56:36] <+RealThiele> CC is king
[1:56:36] <+pectusumbra> the first bob flips them over, mario style
[1:56:38] <MattDemers> Does the resolution seem a bit stretched for anyone else? or is that just my imagination
[1:56:47] <Papa_Bearman> There's no reason to *not* try your Action Commands every single time.
[1:56:48] <%The_Timo> To be more specific while not on their backs they have a Defense
[1:56:49] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[1:56:53] <+Grayhammatter> niceu
[1:56:56] <%SouLucha> Sleeping on the tattle info, eh Woolz?
[1:57:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> @mattdemers he's using an hd sprite pack I believe
[1:57:07] <%SouLucha> They have a defense of 1 standing.
[1:57:28] <thetntm> BTW with goombella you can style by hitting a right when she jumps before the bonk
[1:57:33] <%SouLucha> Meaning you have to do at least 2 damage when they are standing to do damage.
[1:57:33] <bevyrage> @MattDemers resolution is proper to scale. might be the screen borders on the sides and the position on the screen throwing you off? also the little bit in the bottom left getting cut with live cam
[1:57:40] <bbblaketwitching> I cannot wait for Woolie to "X" a guy giving him a gold bar
[1:57:44] <Papa_Bearman> There are no hints.
[1:57:48] <kingkeldeo31> He'll figure it out once the Petalburg Partner joins
[1:57:48] <projectmanatees> im glad everyone is enjoying this bepWow
[1:57:54] <%Proxzo> I don't think there is any is this area
[1:57:54] <bbblaketwitching> there is only the force
[1:57:55] <+RealThiele> but maybe there are hints
[1:57:55] <grimshuck> Goombella's stylish is press A as she jumps
[1:57:57] <%SirGO0SE> this game is such a clean 10/10
[1:58:11] <+ThatChainmecha> I've never played a paper Mario game, which one of them is paper
[1:58:15] <MattDemers> @bevyrage Just feels like the text and icons are a little squooshed, if that makes sense. Goombella looks fine, but Mario looks squashed a bit. Maybe just my imagination
[1:58:19] <%SouLucha> @WoolieVersus Woolie, no don't worry about the invisible blocks, you're better left asking chat if you REALLY want those!
[1:58:22] <+Promessa_EX> can you gamble in this one?
[1:58:28] <+desfore> Yes
[1:58:31] <GenericSoda> yes
[1:58:32] <+FluffiTamamo> Is he playing this in prep for Origami King? Or just becuz?
[1:58:33] <thetntm> you can absolutely gamble
[1:58:37] <+RealThiele> big worry about invisible blocks tho
[1:58:38] <+Promessa_EX> nice
[1:58:40] <%MonsterEnvy> I think just because
[1:58:41] <%Hawk_Rush> @FluffiTamamo just cause
[1:58:42] <frigglefroogle> gambling is one of teh best parts
[1:58:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> just because
[1:58:46] <Solidnick18> Nice
[1:58:46] <%Proxzo> Don't worry about this area for blocks @WoolieVersus
[1:58:55] <shiny_prinny> he's got a flower monkaS
[1:58:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1272752298469609473?s=20
[1:58:56] <kingkeldeo31> I don't think there's any invisible blocks until the castle
[1:58:59] <+AbnormalVoid> got lucky
[1:59:02] <Papa_Bearman> I can't believe the Goomba didn't use that Fire Flower.
[1:59:03] <%Hawk_Rush> uh oh
[1:59:05] <%SouLucha> They already passed one.
[1:59:08] <+FluffiTamamo> Glad people still appreciate the good ones then
[1:59:11] <%MonsterEnvy> Those items the enemies can use
[1:59:13] <%Hawk_Rush> oh, it didn't use the item nice
[1:59:14] <%eyezehuhh> hammer time
[1:59:14] <%dinnydanny777> Does Mario have a hammer in any other game
[1:59:15] <nyacoo> @MattDemers The game's is 4:3, so its stretched here
[1:59:17] <+desfore> Later
[1:59:18] <bevyrage> @MattDemers nah mario's squished like that naturally. the game just has him in small mode compared to having a mushroom to make him big
[1:59:18] <%SouLucha> Before the town.
[1:59:19] <+ThatChainmecha> what do the invisible blocks do? is it just coins?
[1:59:20] <%kyh9> later
[1:59:20] <%lotharrio> I think they just go into your inventory?
[1:59:21] <+marumariball> its for later
[1:59:22] <R3c0n31> They can use them
[1:59:23] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> way later
[1:59:25] <%wrightlight94> thats later
[1:59:26] <Kyphen15> Those are for the enemies to use on you
[1:59:27] <Am_Shigar00> Enemies use them, but you can later get a party member who can steal them
[1:59:28] <TriadOrion> It's a stealing thing, and sometimes those enemies will use them on you
[1:59:29] <MyNameIsRasus> need timestop
[1:59:29] <thelovingfool> later
[1:59:31] <bbblaketwitching> They actually missed three invisible blocks already, the casuals
[1:59:31] <%Ancopro> it also means items that THEY might use
[1:59:31] <+Grayhammatter> you can steal them later on, they can also use them
[1:59:33] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus those aren't for you to get, the enemies can USE those items on you
[1:59:38] <%eyezehuhh> !uptime
[1:59:38] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 8 minutes
[1:59:42] <Papa_Bearman> There's a way to steal later, but it's OPTIONAL.
[1:59:50] <bevyrage> SPLAT FROM THE TOP ROPES
[1:59:54] <thetntm> Hit A right when goombella jumps
[1:59:56] <%Hawk_Rush> PogChamp stylin
[1:59:57] <%MayorRev> hmmmmm!
[1:59:57] <%MonsterEnvy> You can later
[1:59:57] <+desfore> Much later you can steal
[1:59:58] <%kyh9> you can also do that, later
[2:00:01] <+AbnormalVoid> good guess, woolie
[2:00:01] <+Jakeofalco> ssshh
[2:00:01] <%MayorRev> hmmmmmmmm
[2:00:02] <Am_Shigar00> There is a way, just not any time soon
[2:00:05] <bbblaketwitching> there's actually an invisible block in front of you right now
[2:00:09] <%eyezehuhh> are you not entertained?
[2:00:10] <Zalthia> Another streamer I follow is playing Detroit and i just. Cant.
[2:00:10] <bbblaketwitching> in the living room
[2:00:11] <+baggy3058> there's a chance you get those items after you beat them
[2:00:13] <%MonsterEnvy> Goombella's stylish is press a right when she jumps
[2:00:13] <kingkeldeo31> Enemies can have badges and they do affect the enemies
[2:00:22] <+kapcommunist> getting that jump styling down, heck yeah
[2:00:25] <Papa_Bearman> @Zalthia Jesse Cox?
[2:00:27] <+RealThiele> OCD is FED

[2:08:47] <phatmac16> KOOPS IS BUSTED
[2:08:47] <+AsinPersuasion> yup
[2:08:48] <%Taglog7> Koops feels derogatory
[2:08:49] <+RealThiele> but thou MUST
[2:08:51] <Thunderhog> @CrypticMochi Carbon is too hardcore for the LP
[2:08:51] <SixthSun2> Nintendo loves fake choices
[2:08:52] <%SirGO0SE> yep do that often
[2:08:52] <bbblaketwitching> of course
[2:08:54] <%JD_Lars> Goodbye Goombella
[2:08:55] <%dinnydanny777> He starts crying and begging you to take him
[2:08:57] <+Euphbugg> of course
[2:08:58] <Ookamiden02> certainly
[2:08:58] <Torenticus> you can say no you can just never progress LUL

[2:09:04] <Thunderhog> ...in your legs?
[2:09:09] <CrypticMochi> Carbon transcends all
[2:09:09] <Captainflipsy> beg your pardon reggie
[2:09:10] <UnlimitedBick> @SixthSun2 It's a real choice, he'll just stand there and wait.
[2:09:11] <+kapcommunist> stomp him
[2:09:12] <+Grayhammatter> there is your shells
[2:09:12] <SixthSun2> RANGED OPTIONS
[2:09:13] <@Menitta> The start of Super Paper Mario asks if you wanna save the world, and if you say no, it's just game over.
[2:09:14] <Graxe_> Use him as a projectile
[2:09:14] <BurningSaph> Shell kick
[2:09:15] <missingangle> If you say no, I think Goombella just calls you an asshole, Koops cries and you have to let him join
[2:09:18] <NotHereToStream> spine CRUSHED
[2:09:19] <%Superbro64> "Koops's" is actually improper spelling GAME SeriousSloth

[2:24:16] <%Ancopro> it cost 3, the same cost as a LEVEL
[2:24:17] <RyuuAoi> GET!!
[2:24:18] <%The_Timo> You can lose one of the hammers
[2:24:19] <+Audega> Kind of a waste. It's basically just to change what your level up choice was
[2:24:19] <+Slattsquatch> POWER JUMP
[2:24:20] <%xyxlzyzm> HP up badge is the same as a level into HP so ...
[2:24:20] <%Ecchigun> remove close call
[2:24:20] <bbblaketwitching> BIG TRUTHS
[2:24:21] <Papa_Bearman> You don't use Piercing Blow much.
[2:24:23] <%SouLucha> Same as a level.
[2:24:23] <+RealThiele> Do not, my friends, become addicted to Max HP. It will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence
[2:24:24] <TsunTsuchinoko> you aint using power jump or piercin
[2:24:24] <StuffHunter> It's like an HP level that you can swap out.
[2:24:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Free level
[2:24:26] <%cdrom321> That's why you get BP until max.
[2:24:27] <+Masamune195> close call
[2:24:27] <%DatAsuna> You don't use power smash ever tho
[2:24:27] <Spirit_NB> The power of level swapping
[2:24:27] <%SirGO0SE> close call has saved your ass a lot
[2:24:28] <pmmori> piercing isn't great till later
[2:24:28] <bbblaketwitching> BIG RIGHT
[2:24:28] <+Juriasu> get rid of close call
[2:24:28] <+marumariball> @WoolieVersus the costs are the same as a BP level up, no reason not to get BP
[2:24:28] <samura1_queen19> MIA paper planes ✈️
[2:24:28] <kingkeldeo31> Get rid of pierce
[2:24:28] <boomlessjay> piercing blow can go
[2:24:31] <%Jack8274> Power
[2:24:31] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> Option select your level ups on the fly
[2:24:32] <UnlimitedBick> lol why
[2:24:32] <+Dundee15> It's in case you change your mind on a badge level.
[2:24:32] <SixthSun2> Piercing Blow is VERY situational
[2:24:35] <sunnythedrunk> Piercing blow
[2:24:35] <%Ancopro> this is why you go all in on BP
[2:24:37] <Solidnick18> if they become trash sell them
[2:24:37] <amavii> happy heart boys all day every day
[2:24:39] <DetroitSentai> get rid of pierce
[2:24:40] <Am_Shigar00> I'd personally say either power smash or piercing blow, they're pretty interchangable at the moment
[2:24:42] <thelovingfool> close jump and power smash
[2:24:43] <UnlimitedBick> you haven't died yet
[2:24:45] <@akuda_bar> yeah this is why you want BP, so you can just opt to have more HP when you want it
[2:24:45] <%rcand9> big choices
[2:24:46] <shiny_prinny> close call is rng
[2:24:47] <UnlimitedBick> YOU HAVEN'T DIED
[2:24:48] <sunnythedrunk> Piercing blow is worse than power smash
[2:24:49] <grimshuck> power jump is least useful
[2:24:50] <+Grayhammatter> pierce is not needed at this point
[2:24:51] <thelovingfool> Pierce isn't great
[2:24:52] <rubbishbinge> Dump piercing
[2:24:53] <kingkeldeo31> No one has high defense
[2:24:53] <%dinnydanny777> Piercing Blow is a hilarious name for an attack in a Mario game
[2:24:55] <%ozmon> Power Smash would be for big health pools, buuuut so's power jump
[2:24:58] <bbblaketwitching> BP only run boyo
[2:24:58] <BreakersAweigh> i brought power smash all the way until the end of the game
[2:25:00] <Captainflipsy> take off close call
[2:25:00] <%Invlux> Spending level ups to get more badge points to equip the badge to get more hp NotLikeThis
[2:25:00] <+Euphbugg> Give up Power Smash
[2:25:02] <pmmori> Piercing only out does power smash if they have 3 or more armor
[2:25:06] <sunnythedrunk> Get rid of Power Jump
[2:25:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Keep Piercing Blow
[2:25:11] <StuffHunter> Piercing is good for Koopas, but you can jump on them.
[2:25:13] <%Ancopro> you can always sawp power and pierce later
[2:25:14] <%SouLucha> Power Smash will go through defense with sheer power.
[2:25:16] <Papa_Bearman> I say get rid of Piercing Blow.
[2:25:17] <%lotharrio> Power Jump and Power Smash are the same thing, more or less. But Power Jump can target back rows.
[2:25:20] <damienlunas> Piercing
[2:25:23] <@Menitta> Keep Piercing, get rid of pwer jump
[2:25:26] <TheStrigShow> I'd take out Happy Heart and Power Smash
[2:25:31] <%The_Timo> Koops is your power smash
[2:25:33] <+marumariball> power jump can target back row
[2:25:33] <%rcand9> ok
[2:25:33] <%Proxzo> Is that the way to go?
[2:25:35] <+mikeabbages> So close lol
[2:25:35] <Am_Shigar00> I'd keep power jump, get rid of one of the hammers
[2:25:41] <+Masamune195> power jump is so useful lol
[2:25:45] <%dinnydanny777> Is Koops suicidal?
[2:25:46] <%xyxlzyzm> fuck jumps
[2:25:49] <%xyxlzyzm> hammer focus gang
[2:25:51] <%NottaAlotta> love the polka dot grass texture
[2:25:54] <%xyxlzyzm> hammer throw all u need
[2:25:55] <%SirGO0SE> power jump is the only way he can increase damage with jump now tho
[2:25:57] <bbblaketwitching> you could almost make a joke out of that or something
[2:26:05] <caninedog1998> are playing on emulator?
[2:26:11] <%StarMechV> you were suppose to turn off the airplane mid flight
[2:26:12] <%SouLucha> Power Jump will be useful later, when you meet Jump sensitive enemies with lots of defense.
[2:26:12] <+Grayhammatter> no rotating, only perfection
[2:26:14] <GodlyLuigi> power hammer for woolie is harder to fuck up than the jump
[2:26:16] <+mikeabbages> He could've jumped, but he was too hammered..?
[2:26:16] <R3c0n31> Nah 1 Save, get good
[2:26:20] <kingkeldeo31> Rotating saves is for cowards

[2:29:27] <+Euphbugg> Def gone

[2:29:32] <@Menitta> @chesterr01 the NPCs dont change their dialogue but whoever you have out will speak when a cutscene happens

[2:29:35] <Zeif00> Koops has the same utility as hammer pretty much
[2:29:36] <+Euphbugg> the buff ended
[2:29:37] <%dinnydanny777> The Koopas in the audience keep breaking the fourth wall
[2:29:39] <+mikeabbages> he forgot about the shell buff
[2:29:39] <UnlimitedBick> we had a good thing going
[2:29:43] <%SomersaultJustice> this is exciting
[2:29:51] <GenericSoda> i must break you
[2:29:51] <MyNameIsRasus> The buff ended Woolie cmon
[2:29:51] <%MonsterEnvy> It's gone
[2:29:52] <%SouLucha> No.
[2:29:52] <+pectusumbra> no it's gone
[2:29:52] <Bguy32> This fight is awful lmao
[2:29:52] <Kodent> Sick couch Woolie
[2:29:53] <+Grayhammatter> he does not
[2:29:54] <cochramd1992> this is the ideal time to multibounce
[2:29:56] <UnlimitedBick> Defense WHEN STANDING
[2:29:57] <+pectusumbra> it shows up as a mark
[2:29:58] <%lotharrio> Multijump. IT's always multijump
[2:30:00] <Am_Shigar00> Koopas have defense as long as they're standing up
[2:30:05] <%ringabal> There was a buff here. It's gone now
[2:30:06] <UnlimitedBick> LMAO
[2:30:06] <%ozmon> But when Standing, Defense is 1

[2:30:13] <GodlyLuigi> They have no defense on their back, so use power smash, pierce does default hammer levels of damage
[2:30:14] <Captainflipsy> you need to jump em twice
[2:30:15] <TeethMuncher> Woolie...
[2:30:15] <cipher758> i think he got this
[2:30:15] <UnlimitedBick> it's GONNA HAPPEN
[2:30:16] <%Proxzo> Koops have one defense when not flipped
[2:30:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie needs to learn how defense works ASAP
[2:30:21] <%dinnydanny777> Is this a random battle
[2:30:25] <%mmack093> Who's ready for the GG?
[2:30:26] <kingkeldeo31> Yep
[2:30:28] <bbblaketwitching> piercing would have been very good
[2:30:31] <%DatAsuna> canadian eh
[2:30:32] <Papa_Bearman> Like, does Woolie know that doing the Action Command on a Koopa Troopa flips it AND does one attack?
[2:30:33] <+Slattsquatch> This is rough
[2:30:36] <%ozmon> Welcome to Hooktail Castle I guess
[2:30:37] <%Ancopro> jumping disables them

[2:51:42] <sunnythedrunk> Regular hammer works
[2:51:42] <rubbishbinge> Rebuild of Dull Bonegellion
[2:51:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Don't need to pierce Dull, regular Hammer would do it
[2:51:53] <grimshuck> There's instructions for each action command. read them.
[2:51:53] <%SouLucha> This game has no CHILL.
[2:51:55] <ingman112> Relax, they’ll get it at frankly’s
[2:51:59] <+FutureRaith> does woolie know that there's double stylish
[2:52:02] <+Grayhammatter> regular toss him
[2:52:02] <%dinnydanny777> Shouldn't the bones be weak to a hammer
[2:52:06] <GodlyLuigi> basic math a nd reading comprehension, the weakness of the Woolie Madden
[2:52:06] <CursedNobleman> MSTERY
[2:52:07] <%MonsterEnvy> You can run into Red Bones later

[2:52:24] <bbblaketwitching> 2-1=1
[2:52:25] <Skeletonmanners> the audience is all boners too

[2:52:41] <+desfore> @WoolieVersus you can find lost tattles
[2:52:42] <MyNameIsRasus> My OCD would kill me if I missed an enemy scan
[2:52:43] <%SouLucha> HERE WE GO

[2:53:16] <+Grayhammatter> lost tattles can be gained later
[2:53:18] <Papa_Bearman> Heal Goombella.
[2:53:18] <Am_Shigar00> @WoolieVersus Don't worry, if you permanently miss access to a tattle, you can still get it at the trash can at the Professor's place.
[2:53:19] <+Lord0Mugen> @dr_sweets he does?
[2:53:22] <%Ancopro> gombella should have 1 hp now
[2:53:23] <GodlyLuigi> @WoolieVersus Reggie please tell woolie you can fuck up and action command to reset the roulette if you have double poison mushrooms
[2:53:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Scooby doo noises
[2:53:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reload your save!!!
[2:53:33] <NiceZeta> check bernies garbage
[2:53:34] <Mr_Strut> Professor has tattle logs in his trash can
[2:53:34] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> you can get them
[2:53:36] <Solidnick18> just go back to the last save
[2:53:36] <%rcand9> goombella deserved better Kappa
[2:53:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Goombella comes back with 1 hp now
[2:53:39] <bbblaketwitching> delete save data
[2:53:39] <Mr_Taters > Yeah you can get the missable one's thankfully
[2:53:42] <bbblaketwitching> restart
[2:53:42] <Metsfan1000> Lost tattles can be found in Frankly's trash
[2:53:43] <dr_sweets> That's what Bernie's picture was earlier
[2:53:44] <StuffHunter> Don't reload save
[2:53:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> I believe you get them in Franklys office?
[2:53:47] <VideoGameMobes> Oh damn had no idea you could get missed tattles
[2:53:48] <+Masamune195> EASY BATTLE JUST RELOAD
[2:53:48] <gilgatwitcher> Gotta revive Goombella now... ResidentSleeper
[2:53:49] <@chesterr01> you can reset the roulette??

[2:53:52] <%RadicalWeegee> Any single fight bosses will show up back latter in Bernies trash bin
[2:53:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Tattles are in Bernie's trash
[2:54:04] <+TheRisingPride> I didn't know you could get them, I was a reload warrior in this game years back
[2:54:05] <GodlyLuigi> the roulette is a reward for doing action commands, messing one up resets it
[2:54:07] <@Commando_Joe> woolieGASM barrSploosh barrSpray
[2:54:08] <%SouLucha> @GodlyLuigi huh, I never thought of that.
[2:54:09] <+Shady_Zaku> Shick Hydrobot says hello
[2:54:10] <bbblaketwitching> as thought he was nixon
[2:54:14] <Kyphen15> The Mr. Popo looking guy has the "Switch partner for free badge" cost 8 star pieces
[2:54:16] <$tkuwari> I didn't know about Franky's trash. Incredible
[2:54:16] <Prevot> gotta get that Quick Swap badge
[2:54:17] <%mmack093> you're over thinking it
[2:54:21] <bbblaketwitching> QUICK SWAP BADGEE
[2:54:23] <dr_sweets> The game doesn't tell you, but the c-stick is a shortcut for items and partner swapping
[2:54:25] <%DatAsuna> If only there was a badge for that
[2:54:26] <%kralec> @WoolieVersus you get a badge to let you swap without using a turn later. Just not yet.
[2:54:28] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> there is Pekaboo for seeing health
[2:54:31] <@chesterr01> kk
[2:54:32] <BreakersAweigh> @chesterr01 so the roulette starts when you do actions correctly, so you can reset the roulette if you have poison mushrooms by fuckin up
[2:54:33] <Metsfan1000> Mushroom
[2:54:33] <grimshuck> That is why quick swap badge is so good
[2:54:35] <%MonsterEnvy> You can heal her now

[2:54:46] <%The_Timo> There's no revive, just heal
[2:54:48] <$tkuwari> Shes Only Dead on the Inside

[2:54:52] <KatabolicRage> then go into battle with her out

[2:58:52] <LordOfThePoultry> rayman 2 Kreygasm
[2:58:53] <glass_marcus> rayman 1 is insanely hard
[2:58:55] <StuffHunter> Origins and Legends are amazing. The first game is a sin.
[2:58:55] <$tkuwari> Rayman on the Gameboy Advanced was not that great
[2:58:55] <bbblaketwitching> We already know what they do

[3:10:39] <Mr_Strut> Koops has some sick ass breakdancing
[3:10:41] <+TheRisingPride> Do they have access to the badge that tells them the style timing this early? I don't remember when you get that
[3:10:42] <%Ancopro> stylish timing is different for most moves. Koops is usually on recovery of his moves
[3:10:44] <%lotharrio> Saw a monkey with a laser. That's hiphop.

[3:40:40] <WaifusSansFrontieres> Luigi hides his heckling as support by throwing items
[3:40:40] <%StarMechV> You DON'T GET FP BY APPEAL AAAA
[3:40:45] <Am_Shigar00> @MayorRev Yup, I've gotten Super Mushrooms multiple times in the past.
[3:40:48] <+Navekraith> Luigi like " i help ya bro, what aint gonna get not princess ass, ill be in the crowd hit me up when ya change ya mind. Real talk

[3:41:18] <TeethMuncher> @cdrom321 but what if he needs it for the final boss?
[3:41:24] <%Invlux> PAPER THIN
[3:41:44] <%SirGO0SE> deep tho
[3:41:49] <missingangle> Unlike the newer games that are constantly like "Hey, guys! LOOK, PAPER"
[3:41:51] <%tomokocchi_> this is when Paper Mario played the paper thing more subtle, not like today where it's hammered in every five seconds
[3:41:54] <kingkeldeo31> star piece
[3:41:54] <Am_Shigar00> To be fair, it's more of a paper puppet style animation rather than literal paper in this one.

[3:57:49] <%SouLucha> @TeethMuncher She's still got a better skill set for these battles than Koops though.
[3:57:50] <@akuda_bar> game beat doesn't matter
[3:57:53] <+twohitgood> not sure if woolie is trying but every attack has a stylish and some have multiples.

[4:05:22] <%yeknomlive> if you ever wanna defeat woolie put an egg badge on

[5:18:57] <+tearfuldevil> hating gamestop = / = haitng individual franchise owners or employees
[5:19:09] <%xyxlzyzm> ^^
[5:19:16] <%Superbro64> Reminder that Brendaniel worked at Gamestop
[5:19:17] <missingangle> Gamestop is ass; they legit just said "We need our workers here to sell our games. We don't care about their lives, we NEED MONEY."
[5:19:19] <anarchistPastry> wait, whatd gamestop do this time?
[5:19:26] <%Superbro64> he celebrated when he finally left
[5:19:29] <+tearfuldevil> @anarchistPastry nothing new, afaik
[5:19:34] <TeethMuncher> That's capitalism, baby!
[5:19:36] <%xyxlzyzm> fuck gamestop
[5:19:43] <%keyoray> no, gamestop is not forgiven. ever.
[5:19:44] <%DatAsuna> bowser confirmed more moral than gamestop
[5:19:47] <Mr__Jebus> 2 wrongs dont make a right
[5:19:50] <%FatherGreyBeard> FatherGreyBeard subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[5:20:00] <MillaMoks> Thanks for the PrideToucan @fathergreybeard
[5:20:01] <%Superbro64> chat, N E V E R show love for a company
[5:20:02] <%kralec> @anarchistPastry they are talking about some GameStops trying to stay open during the initial COVID shit, and they forced their employees to work while the CEOs worked from home
[5:20:03] <+scorpiozilla> WWE as well
[5:20:06] <%Superbro64> its the people that matter
[5:20:07] <%LordDukeFishington> Its like saying we should forgive Amazon for how they treat their employees
[5:20:10] <%Superbro64> every time
[5:20:11] <samura1_queen19> What did GameStop do?
[5:20:11] <%doombawkzvs> Cowards play
[5:20:13] <missingangle> As long as the hate doesn't go to specific workers or owners who have no control, then feel free to go all out on Gamestop hatred. They deserve it
[5:20:16] <+jiggy_snipe> don't forget to lie if the police show up
[5:20:31] <%doombawkzvs> Gamespot
[5:20:39] <%infinite_rotation> @woolieversus how are things going for you guys, just in general?
[5:20:40] <%doombawkzvs> Now THAT's a name I haven't heard for many moons
[5:20:54] <%keyoray> Gamestop would kill their employees and customers for their bottom line. Not inconvenience, but kill. And it's not a good death.
[5:20:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> What does Gamestop even contribute to society to have people still caping for them?
[5:21:01] <%TomFrancis_> barely
[5:21:07] <%Ancopro> yea fuck them. unsub from gamespot
[5:21:11] <%Livelinne> serfSadbread
[5:21:11] <arkv01> yeah fuckin rip, qhwn gf
[5:21:13] <Mahbonk> aww damnit i missed the Gamestop rant
[5:21:19] <Mahbonk> Oh im sorry. EbGames
[5:21:21] <+lojack69> Best buy doesn't always got the game you want, and noone else carries older stuff
[5:21:27] <Mahbonk> Support your local video game store
[5:21:30] <%doombawkzvs> Gamestop more like Lame-stop? Amirite? Heheheheheheheh LUL
[5:21:31] <arkv01> when gamestop dies small vidya business will pick up
[5:21:33] <%ChoculaUltra> haven't they filed for bankruptcy a handful of times already? or am I thinking about radio shack?
[5:21:40] <Zayasu> i buy most games from ebay LUL
[5:21:41] <+lojack69> its not great but i'm strapped for choices cause I like buying physical
[5:21:41] <%DatAsuna> yeah you do kinda squander the style points otherwise
[5:21:42] <Mr_Strut> Special moves are free
[5:21:49] <@Solidus_113> The gameplay loop is a little to get used to
[5:21:55] <HoIyShadows> yea gamestop needs to go back to stock better stuff
[5:21:55] <%FatherGreyBeard> Smoke em if you got them
[5:21:58] <%DatAsuna> He'll use it more when he has the attacking star powers
[5:22:06] <%Superbro64> Use those I T E M S tho woolie
[5:22:08] <$NoWayRyanTatum> @woolieversus I was a part of the corporate staff that got laid off, can confirm first hand they are trash
[5:22:10] <NotHereToStream> or buff star power
[5:22:15] <Mangahero18> Also stylish moves build meter SOOOO fast.
[5:22:15] <%keyoray> why buy BRAND?
[5:22:18] <Prevot> you're doing stylish moves so you'll get it back quick
[5:22:18] <%Superbro64> your inventory will get FULL otherwise SeriousSloth
[5:22:22] <%SouLucha> Rather, he should be saving some.
[5:22:32] <Mr_Strut> You can also deposit items are the store
[5:22:34] <%DensityD> freeze grenade
[5:22:47] <%Superbro64> if you never use items, you will be full of low tier shit when you ACTUALLY need them my man
[5:23:07] <%SouLucha> That life shroom for example is a good idea to not try to use.
[5:23:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:23:09] <%xyxlzyzm> tbh it is basically a heal spell but also a "mana" top-off
[5:23:15] <+lojack69> inventory space is limited, and the better healing items just get thrown at you constantly later
[5:23:16] <%SouLucha> Rather save it for cooking.
[5:23:24] <%xyxlzyzm> COOKING
[5:23:25] <+lojack69> so just go nuts, youll never be dry on items
[5:23:27] <+TheRisingPride> Oh man, cooking
[5:23:29] <%Superbro64> shhh
[5:23:35] <%xyxlzyzm> cooking da best
[5:23:40] <%SouLucha> Not really...
[5:23:42] <Thunderhog> Isn't that just the stands
[5:23:42] <missingangle> We fans are trying to be chill, I swear. Could do without doing the backseat gaming so much, though.
[5:23:52] <%RadicalWeegee> NAH MAX OUT BP
[5:24:01] <%Superbro64> N A H
[5:24:06] <JeoDood> NAH
[5:24:08] <stuffamiriteyea> MORE BP IS GOOD
[5:24:08] <+pectusumbra> You can swap them around until you can get more BP though
[5:24:09] <Mr_Strut> That will happen even if you max out BP
[5:24:10] <@Solidus_113> make the sacrifices to change what you have equipped
[5:24:11] <%SouLucha> It's fine Woolz, you do you.
[5:24:12] <%Ancopro> Also as you saw, you can get HP/FP badges.
[5:24:14] <%Superbro64> this a bad take N A H
[5:24:16] <Mr_Strut> There are SO many badges
[5:24:16] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus it's a balance. you gotta get a bit of both
[5:24:18] <Self_esteampunk> play how ya want
[5:24:18] <%xyxlzyzm> @WoolieVersus just sit on like 3 or 5 extra BP then, nothing gets much bigger than that
[5:24:19] <Shwepie> FP Badges were invented to solve that problem.
[5:24:21] <%SouLucha> It'll be interesting!
[5:24:30] <%YakumoYomi> Woolie is all about "new moves", so it makes sense to go with BP
[5:24:32] <%DatAsuna> You're fine as long as you have like 15-20 for the rest of the game
[5:24:34] <JeoDood> BP
[5:24:34] <dr_sweets> You can only get so much BP Woolie
[5:24:40] <Thunderhog> And you wont have enough BP to equip EVERYTHING in the game, so you gotta manage it a bit
[5:24:40] <%doombawkzvs> He will learn
[5:24:41] <%DatAsuna> *15-20 FP that is
[5:24:41] <TheArrow_> i played this game and i think i chose bp every time except once, didn't regret a thing
[5:24:44] <%doombawkzvs> Let him find out on his own
[5:24:45] <%Ancopro> BP is absolutely worth it
[5:24:45] <+lojack69> BP first is best way to play
[5:24:49] <dr_sweets> And there's so many badges. You're not supposed to use them all
[5:24:52] <%SouLucha> Yes, he will, he'll learn.
[5:24:53] <missingangle> The good thing with this game is that you can play a very different game each time just by changing how you use your exp. Using most of it on BP or FP, etc. It's a different experience cause of that.
[5:24:55] <stuffamiriteyea> Woolie gets it
[5:24:56] <+lojack69> especially since you can just put on FP and HP plus badges as you find em
[5:25:04] <JeoDood> ^
[5:25:07] <+Audega> BP > FP > HP
[5:25:09] <dr_sweets> FP is Mana
[5:25:12] <TheLemuroid> Is there is a point where you can reassign exp?
[5:25:13] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus bigger movelist, 1 ex bar to use it
[5:25:15] <%SouLucha> More moves, can't use.
[5:25:21] <+relentingapunch> BP is equip load
[5:25:30] <arkv01> this BGM is so soothing, hwaow
[5:25:31] <glass_marcus> Woolie can get through the game with 15 base fp easily
[5:25:39] <%SouLucha> ?
[5:25:40] <Thunderhog> THE BOULDER

[5:32:05] <%kyh9> It's literally fanfiction
[5:32:10] <%Proxzo> It's sad, the director of this game got sent to the Card Game Mines. That's why the other games never had this kinda heart.
