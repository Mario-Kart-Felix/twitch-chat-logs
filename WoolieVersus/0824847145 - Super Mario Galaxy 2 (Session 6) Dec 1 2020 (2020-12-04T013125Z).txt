[0:06:04] <%ozzrabbit> Pistachio
[0:06:08] <FourthQueen> Cashews that are sold are all toasted
[0:06:14] <+cvp5127> you need to fold it 1000 times

[0:06:21] <+MTLxSpider> wait what
[0:06:21] <+JoeyStar> cashews are pricey for a reason
[0:06:22] <Equirah> yup LUL
[0:06:26] <derap41> The fruit is poisonous and gives the workers skin cancers
[0:06:29] <%ggbhtg> Cashews, the DIAMONDS of nuts
[0:06:36] <+JustToWatch> it actually looks fake
[0:06:38] <armchairmaster_> WHY GROW THAT SHIT?
[0:06:41] <Mr_Strut> Fuck that fruit!
[0:06:41] <%Jack8274> And then I milk them
[0:06:51] <%RyuuAoi> Straight peanuts are only straight until they are tempted.
[0:06:55] <%cache_22> Cashew fruits look like bell peppers excreting a nut.
[0:06:56] <+TheotherKristian> Cashews should be banned
[0:06:57] <%jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[0:06:59] <PanicSwytch> I always buy the giant container of cashews from Costco
[0:07:01] <%X2Eliah> "And it's just the tip?" -Reggie, 2020
[0:07:02] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:07:05] <+darkmoonhero> it's poisonous too Im pretty sure
[0:07:12] <+cvp5127> psaBougie
[0:07:13] <Shardlab> The cashew fruit can actually hurt you
[0:07:18] <%ChoculaUltra> same thing with coffee beans and the fruit they're taken from.
[0:07:18] <%Jack8274> They would rather feed skittles to pigs
[0:07:19] <Torgue_1> Literally poisonous
[0:07:20] <derap41> Its toxic
[0:07:27] <%RyTYoung> Because they COST LIVES LUL
[0:07:34] <%RyuuAoi> Some nuts are toxic...
[0:07:36] <andrewofbob> Not even good for compost?
[0:07:38] <derap41> those workers have to breath that poison too
[0:07:39] <stardustcrusad3r> wtff learning nut facts
[0:07:39] <armchairmaster_> Just feed the fruit to convicted murderers and abusers Kappa
[0:07:40] <+darkmoonhero> does any animal eat the fruit?
[0:07:41] <Equirah> chat everything's toxic.....
[0:07:48] <%LastHazzerd> humans eat poison on the regular, fuggin' grapes and peppers and nonesense
[0:07:53] <ManJazzSSBM> bet its cheaper than Tekken DLC ugh
[0:07:53] <%RyTYoung> Don't eat chat, it's toxic woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:07:57] <%ChoculaUltra> fun fact - peaches are banned at most prisons because of the trace amounts of cyanide that naturally exists inside of peach pits
[0:08:01] <+Jakev91489> I like the taste of poison
[0:08:05] <andrewofbob> Well, if you have an allergy, all nuts are poison
[0:08:05] <+darkmoonhero> shark fin hoo ha ha doodmaxhype
[0:08:07] <derap41> Peanuts are like the only nuts that aren't horribly inefficient
[0:08:13] <derap41> and they aren't even nuts
[0:08:13] <Shardlab> "Raw cashews contain urushiol, a resin that is toxic if ingested and can cause rashes or burns if it contacts the skin"
[0:08:13] <%ggbhtg> HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU KILLED? How many cashews have you grown?....
[0:08:18] <%Jack8274> Cashew Chicken is dope tho
[0:08:20] <%RyuuAoi> Eat enough apple seeds and your ass is grass.
[0:08:23] <%LastHazzerd> you bastard
[0:08:30] <+jaiykakoo> Cashews are basically like poaching
[0:08:31] <%X2Eliah> Peanuts are not horrible because they are basically beans
[0:08:35] <henshin2289> The rest goes on to make composted soil.
[0:08:38] <%alphalejandro> So expensive nuts
[0:08:41] <+JustToWatch> Cashew butter is god tier
[0:08:41] <nmaten> peanut????

[0:08:53] <%X2Eliah> Pistachios are good *until* you get a slightly old one
[0:08:54] <Shardlab> @RyuuAoi Yup. Cyanide in trace amounts
[0:08:57] <derap41> Pistachios are god tier even unsalted
[0:09:00] <+TheotherKristian> Whole almonds are fine
[0:09:00] <+Jakev91489> Honestly peanuts are so underrated
[0:09:00] <@Solidus_113> this first world problem
[0:09:03] <andrewofbob> Pistachio ICE CREAM
[0:09:05] <%Jack8274> But the extra work is helpful to prevent eating to much!
[0:09:07] <+delilah4you> Sunflower Seeds
[0:09:08] <+redhandedbee> Love pistachios
[0:09:10] <+delilah4you> Are the worst
[0:09:21] <YakumoYomi> I love cashews, but fuck if they aren't expensive compared to peanuts
[0:09:23] <derap41> Bitter almonds are really the only nuts that are dangerous to eat because of Cyanide
[0:09:24] <brian_peppers1> Pomengranates are the worst
[0:09:25] <%RyuuAoi> Yeah I hate cracking them bitches ngl

[0:11:55] <%dreadedcthulhu> I'm normally a picky eater
[0:11:55] <velgaduere> alright I can't get behind this take
[0:11:55] <nmaten> edamame is great
[0:11:56] <@Solidus_113> it can be good in rice
[0:11:57] <armchairmaster_> WOOLIE STOP
[0:11:59] <+jaiykakoo> We need to buff pistachios, they‚Äôve been lagging behind in the meta too long
[0:12:00] <%RyuuAoi> Meh

[0:12:40] <velgaduere> wishful seasoning :)
[0:12:42] <%ChoculaUltra> ChoculaUltra subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! You know, I was skeptical when Reggie rebranded to WoolieVersus and brought Woolie on, but 2 years later and I still come back for more Kappa
[0:12:46] <armchairmaster_> @woolieversus you gotta suck the pea out of the edamame to get the garlic spice
[0:12:47] <%Lion_kun> YOU LICK THE SALT ON THE FINGERS AND ITS TASTIER
[0:12:47] <%RyuuAoi> Y'all suck y'all chips too? @woolieversus

[0:12:59] <RodCU> salted pumpkin seeds are great
[0:12:59] <Equirah> fuck what others do
[0:13:01] <%Jack8274> I know people who chew the skin\
[0:13:04] <huskarl_zap> what about potato skins?

[0:13:06] <Marc_The_Frog > isn't a man man entitled to the sweat off his brow whilst he eats
[0:13:13] <andrewofbob> Potato skin is ok
[0:13:14] <Mr_Strut> no u
[0:13:21] <derap41> Pumpkin seeds are such a fucking hassel
[0:13:24] <%Jack8274> Potato skins are so good, a little cheese and bacon on top and bam
[0:13:24] <ManJazzSSBM> lionkun put on blast
[0:13:26] <%baka_sugoi> N U T woolieGLORY
[0:13:26] <%ChoculaUltra> potato skins are very hit or miss in my experience
[0:13:31] <SerRule1> it's a light vege snack before your high sodium meal
[0:13:31] <+delilah4you> This is the most first world nonsense I've heard today
[0:13:35] <+delilah4you> And I work with boomers all day
[0:13:35] <+MajorCrasher> god has abandoned this channel...
[0:13:36] <DatAsuna> potato skin is fine yee but it depends how it's cooked
[0:13:36] <+beegduck> potato skin be deeelish

[0:13:40] <%Lion_kun> Its like sauce on chicken wings, its tastier
[0:13:45] <%X2Eliah> You know, that's a good point. If a food requires you to literally spit it out, it's bad at being food.
[0:13:48] <derap41> Just get a bag of it
[0:13:48] <armchairmaster_> FUCK YOU i lick my fingers all the time? BBQ ribs, lick my finger. Hot wings? Lick my fingers, spicy garlic edamame? LICK THAT STUFF

[0:14:13] <+jaiykakoo> The BLACK TECH
[0:14:15] <%Jack8274> @beegduck Only if it's been candied
[0:14:16] <redrins> woolie hates bananas confirmed
[0:14:17] <%ChoculaUltra> I finger lick during private meals, never with friends/comrades!
[0:14:19] <derap41> You want it pre chewed too?
[0:14:22] <armchairmaster_> @velgaduere hands are natural fork and knives for humans tho
[0:14:27] <+jaiykakoo> FORBIDDEN TECH
[0:14:28] <+panlakes> edamame is just green beans that got cut
[0:14:28] <derap41> Just a straight food tube?
[0:14:31] <DatAsuna> WoolieVS Soylent
[0:14:38] <+MajorCrasher> man these takes are nuclear
[0:14:43] <Equirah> @DatAsuna LUL
[0:14:43] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie... Pine Nuts!
[0:14:47] <@Menitta> "What's the point of this banana, I gotta PEEL it?!"
[0:14:49] <+beegduck> @jack8274 I eat rind with or without sugar. I love bitter
[0:14:55] <RodCU> woolie hates opening the aluminum wrap from burguers in order to eat them
[0:14:56] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie Vs. MANUAL LABOR
[0:15:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I love the ‚Äúwork‚Äù. It‚Äôs part of the fun for me.
[0:15:04] <+backfire_shot> its bizzare seeing chat still flowing but i dont get to hear whats happening due to an ad lol
[0:15:06] <%Jack8274> "A terry chocolate orange should be broken apart. Whats with all this hitting."
[0:15:07] <%Lion_kun> Woolie just put everything in a blender and drink from a straw.
[0:15:09] <derap41> Hotest take
[0:15:15] <%ggbhtg> I KNOW MANY A FUCKEE
[0:15:22] <velgaduere> aight I'm back on this train
[0:15:24] <@Menitta> you end up with a pile of garbage
[0:15:25] <%ggbhtg> I KNOW A FUCKER or two

[0:15:28] <+jaiykakoo> That was me
[0:15:30] <%RyuuAoi> OKAY
[0:15:32] <velgaduere> literally baby bird bullshit
[0:15:33] <%jiggy_snipe> backchew LUL
[0:15:35] <%ChoculaUltra> back chew sounds awful.
[0:15:39] <Darren716> Sunflower seeds are exclusively an outside food
[0:15:40] <Equirah> vomit implis being digested to a degree...
[0:15:40] <%Jack8274> I used to eat the shells as a kid
[0:15:41] <RodCU> after chew
[0:15:41] <Cykron> It's like tobacco dip
[0:15:43] <jorniev> BRINGS A SACHEL BAG OF SUNFLOWERS
[0:15:44] <SerRule1> @WoolieVersus How about Fererro Rocher? Do you mind unwrapping the candy with the wrapper that keeps the chocolate krisp?
[0:15:44] <%Aztec50> what?
[0:15:45] <Shardlab> Cows
[0:15:46] <%dreadedcthulhu> it's just non-tobacco dipping
[0:15:47] <ffairyb> damn i never buy unpealed seeds
[0:15:49] <%X2Eliah> Saliva is partly digestive
[0:15:53] <%RyuuAoi> It's spit
[0:15:55] <ffairyb> and it also smells like SHIT
[0:15:59] <%Terrarp> I eat the whole thing tho
[0:16:00] <derap41> Pomegranate?
[0:16:01] <%X2Eliah> Like, seriously. Saliva is the first stage of digestion
[0:16:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> its cud
[0:16:05] <armchairmaster_> You don't...throw the shells away?
[0:16:11] <+beegduck> I ate sunflower seed shells as a kid until I had a big bloody shit. now I just don't eat them ever.
[0:16:14] <%dreadedcthulhu> it's literally just chewing non-tobacco
[0:16:14] <+delilah4you> When I eat sunflower seeds I have a little plastic bag I spit into
[0:16:16] <bronco_kozak> but that's a slavic tradition
[0:16:16] <%ggbhtg> @woolieversus RIGHT NEXT to the Hot Cheetos FailFish
[0:16:17] <derap41> Fuckers that eat pomegranate and spit the seeds
[0:16:18] <Shardlab> Kids filled desks full of it back in school and it's disgusting
[0:16:18] <%Jack8274> That's the type of person who would eat seeds in public
[0:16:18] <+delilah4you> So I can throw it away
[0:16:21] <+backfire_shot> If your eating peanuts eat them whole shell and all
[0:16:22] <+delilah4you> LIke a HUMAN FUCKING BEING
[0:16:27] <+tealplague> nonono you throw that shit away immediately
[0:16:29] <%ozzrabbit> Don‚Äôt they also flavor Sunflower seeds?
[0:16:32] <Darren716> If they leave it on a table you have the right to fight them
[0:16:34] <%RyuuAoi> In a bowl, cup, napkin, floor....
[0:16:36] <%LastHazzerd> you squat on your stoop, and eat your sunflower seeds
[0:16:38] <Marc_The_Frog > woolie only eats rations
[0:16:39] <Cykron> Sunflower seeds are for recovering tobacco dip chewers
[0:16:41] <nmaten> an empty water bottle is perfect for sunflower seed shells
[0:16:44] <%ggbhtg> doodWat
[0:16:47] <velgaduere> yeah that's why I only get bags of preshelled
[0:16:53] <+hax_metatron> How many streams before finishing Mario Galaxy you think?
[0:16:56] <%Terrarp> The shell is good tho
[0:16:57] <+jaiykakoo> BLACK PEPPER SUNFLOWER SEEDS POG
[0:16:58] <ManJazzSSBM> do it Three Stooges style: eat shells, toss nuts and meat.
[0:16:59] <%ggbhtg> the SMALLEST smackerl

[0:17:12] <%Jack8274> I always hate a dry ass nut
[0:17:13] <+backfire_shot> nut is a meat
[0:17:13] <%Lion_kun> Woolie, you hate breakfast, why are you coming with hot food takes
[0:17:13] <derap41> Fucking Gopniks!

[0:17:20] <%Jack8274> MY NUT IS DRY
[0:17:21] <Pookiedaexzile> This another soup thing
[0:17:21] <Equirah> Sunflower seeds and pistachios are for people with oral fixation

[0:17:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:17:42] <@Solidus_113> If you eat sunflower seeds you're probably an asshole
[0:17:45] <velgaduere> @armchairmaster_ he's completely denounced any and all foods that require shelling
[0:17:50] <ManJazzSSBM> nobody likes roasted nuts- microwave guy

[0:17:59] <%cache_22> Reggie should bring a bag of sunflower seeds tomorrow just to mess with Woolie.
[0:17:59] <velgaduere> except lobster
[0:18:00] <@Menitta> Everyone who eats sunflower seeds probably bullied Shia Labeouf as a kid
[0:18:02] <jorniev> YOU ARE THE SUNFLOWER
[0:18:02] <@akuda_bar> sometimes you get on the train here and the floor is covered in sunflower seeds
[0:18:02] <+panlakes> are peeled fruits in this venn diagram?
[0:18:03] <%wardogleader15> sunflower seeds f tier confirmed
[0:18:04] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie does not want to work for his food

[0:18:08] <%LastHazzerd> they sell 'em
[0:18:11] <velgaduere> they sell them in the states
[0:18:12] <%Jack8274> They are expensive as fuck but they sell them
[0:18:12] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie, GIVE EGGS A CHANCE.

[0:18:45] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:18:46] <%X2Eliah> Eggs are nowhere near comparable. You don't put eggshells in your mouth
[0:18:47] <%Jack8274> They are in the health aisle next too flax seeds
[0:18:48] <RodCU> food for assholes sounds like a show
[0:18:54] <Shardlab> Buying a bag of trash with tiny bits of flavored gunk to possibly eat
[0:18:55] <armchairmaster_> Just eat bread guys, nature's napkin for saucy things
[0:19:00] <derap41> Pomegranate?
[0:19:00] <%ggbhtg> Don't forget assholes that consume ass
[0:19:01] <%ozzrabbit> I again point to Pine Nuts. You better have them pre-shelled, because otherwise be ready to use a f-big HAMMER to open them!
[0:19:01] <+beegduck> I eat like a maniac but who the fk would eat eggshells
[0:19:06] <Shardlab> It's not food, it's a thing to do for assholes
[0:19:07] <%DemonOfSalt> Preach it Woolie.
[0:19:11] <HollowMan190> "Eating seeds is there past time activities"
[0:19:12] <Solidnick18> what food would make you an asshole?

[0:29:05] <@Solidus_113> Existentialism though, the opposite
[0:29:05] <RealDurdyDan> Helps me sleep at night
[0:29:08] <GoogleyGareth> It's a double edged sword though because if you're gonna die then fuck it just give up lol
[0:29:11] <%Seancicle> we shrimpin?
[0:29:12] <%afronooch> yeah, acknowledging my mortality makes me more hedonistic tbh
[0:29:13] <DatAsuna> conversely "Every journey has it's final step, don't rush"

[0:29:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Nihilism is not poggers
[0:29:31] <%Javaa01> Javaa01 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Gotta ask since the LP is around the corner, but what are you planning on playing Zero on? The ports are pretty much clean across everything, but I mean, now that you've got an absurdly powerful PC to throw at it, what's the plan?
[0:29:34] <%RyuuAoi> Resistance is futile
[0:29:36] <velgaduere> nihilism is so fucking boring
[0:29:42] <@Menitta> I need to finish The Good Place

[0:29:50] <ManJazzSSBM> as a nihlist, i hate depression brought on by "im gonna die anyway" thoughts
[0:29:50] <Qsmash_> I don't think telling people to die is cool

[0:29:56] <%alphalejandro> or y'know LIMBO
[0:29:57] <%doomerskeletor13> The Good Place is, as its name implies, very good
[0:29:57] <@akuda_bar> @RioGascar yes
[0:30:02] <%LastHazzerd> it's super duper not pointless, so don't fuck up?

[0:30:15] <GoogleyGareth> I feel like I've got all I can out of nihilism and it's no longer a motivator, so I'm trying to switch back to giving a shit.
[0:30:22] <%RioGascar> I remember my ethics class when we got to nihilism
[0:30:24] <%ekodrop> punch mom is no more??
[0:30:30] <velgaduere> like imagine adopting a philosophy simply to justify how fucking boring you are
[0:30:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Nihilism is waynerWhiteP waynerWhite

[0:31:02] <Pookiedaexzile> People are still pushing it
[0:31:07] <%alphonseisbest> @velgaduere and whats wrong with that?
[0:31:07] <%Theycallmenerf> Woolie and Punchmom are okay right?
[0:31:07] <RealDurdyDan> @RunoEddie Probably
[0:31:09] <%Seancicle> Rü§ûüèª
[0:31:12] <Pookiedaexzile> LOL
[0:31:13] <T_Sasquatch> People don't realise religion is the ultimate coping mechanism
[0:31:17] <%LastHazzerd> I can't believe Reggie is dumping Woolie, cuz he keeps waxing philosophy
[0:31:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Y‚Äôall are reading too much into his tweet
[0:31:24] <%ekodrop> having mario around in the house was too much for punch mom
[0:31:25] <%dreadedcthulhu> life could suck, but it doesn't have to - why not do the thing that makes life less shitty for yourself and those around you?
[0:31:28] <@akuda_bar> they havent broken up, people are just dumb
[0:31:32] <Pookiedaexzile> woolie: Tries to be motivational People: Is this a Divorce tweet
[0:31:36] <samazam94> @woolieversus WOOLIE ARE YOU GOING TO DIE PLS DONT DIE ON US!!!!!
[0:31:38] <GoogleyGareth> Truth is you'll never have a motivator that'll always work for the rest of your life. You'll adapt to it and circumvent it, so you gotta be willing to switch it up when it does lose its power to motivate you.

[0:33:03] <%ggbhtg> If nothing else matters, all that matters is what we do
[0:33:03] <%LastHazzerd> so anyways, thanks to denial, i'm immortal
[0:33:03] <%ekodrop> baby don't hurt me
[0:33:04] <doomerskeletor13> Meaninglessness allows you to create your own meaning
[0:33:04] <+NickHatesSnow> exactly woolie
[0:33:06] <ManJazzSSBM> woolie Vs dmt
[0:33:06] <%RyuuAoi> Well you grow wiser with age. We were all shit kids at one point in life.
[0:33:07] <%RioGascar> I mean if we really wanna get down to it, we exist to just create an offspring. the fact we try for other things are motivating factors outside of our given purpose
[0:33:10] <Rawbone_saw> it's /actual/ nihilism, not blackpill nihilism
[0:33:12] <%jiggy_snipe> @Menitta thinking the same thing lol

[0:33:31] <ManJazzSSBM> woolie went thru egodeath lmaoooooo
[0:33:32] <+Wessuri> the struggle to find meaning in a void is meaningful in itself
[0:33:36] <%ggbhtg> If nothing else matters, all that matters is what we do @woolieversus
[0:33:37] <CrmznOgre> love = "your Societial norms and your mammal brain pushing you to reproduce."
[0:33:37] <%LCLSmoothie> the ending of eva tv taught me this
[0:33:44] <+backfire_shot> In a Cosmic sense we're a mistake that shouldn't exist and the fact that we do Motivates me everyday
[0:33:46] <+RunoEddie> I actually understand where Woolie is coming from, but the jokes are still funny
[0:33:47] <%doomerskeletor13> WoolieVs getting real
[0:33:50] <%RioGascar> Like hey being an artist is technically pointless as it goes against humans biological goal of reproduce and foster a child to adult and then die
[0:33:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Sphere theory: A sphere is both Pointless and infinitely full of points at every angle
[0:33:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Such is life

[0:34:10] <%RioGascar> find the meaning yourself

[0:37:24] <%LastHazzerd> c'mon woolie, you totally helped bring Yakuza to the west!
[0:37:29] <%cache_22> I just played all the Yakuza games this year. They are a blast. I hope they enjoy it.
[0:37:33] <RayCSmooth> there's no pressure if you just do it Kappa
[0:37:35] <phatmac16> It won‚Äôt live up to the hype except Majima‚Äôs intro
[0:37:37] <@Menitta> I think it was also your surprise at what Judgment was that pushed the push even more
[0:37:39] <T_Sasquatch> Yakuza NOW BabyRage
[0:37:41] <%ggbhtg> The river is always flowing
[0:37:41] <DatAsuna> he did play some judgment

[0:37:59] <%superc37> all you need to know is that nugget is the best boi
[0:38:10] <@Menitta> Yakuza 0 is just a good game. Thats all one needs to go in
[0:38:16] <velgaduere> ^
[0:38:17] <%LastHazzerd> just.... know that it is a ActionRPG, and NOT an Action game
[0:38:17] <%doomerskeletor13> 3 is the worst one, but it‚Äôs still a good game
[0:38:19] <+RunoEddie> amazing how we go through this song and dance every single time, people overhype stuff for Woolie, then it becomes impossible bar to hit, and Woolie becomes disappointed
[0:38:20] <%X2Eliah> So the thing is, Woolie, it's weird because you are such a japan weeb otherwise
[0:38:20] <phatmac16> It‚Äôs just a good game
[0:38:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Will there be a back tattoo reveal when you start the Yakuzie Lp
[0:38:25] <%RyuuAoi> 2020 the year of FPS for Woolie Vs. 2021 the year of RPGs?

[0:38:42] <derap41> Its good but its also Yakuza fansism
[0:38:49] <%superc37> its a jrpg with the gameplay of a 3d beat em up

[0:38:55] <Pookiedaexzile> But fuck that tho, Are you doing the Back tattoo reveal for the Yakuzie stream
[0:39:06] <@Menitta> more people need to push Trauma Team

[0:47:34] <%superc37> ye i figured as much
[0:47:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah we lookin for some different

[0:47:49] <dundunsun> Being good at souls games is actually uncool
[0:47:54] <Prevot> matt and Pat's yakuza 0 lp wasn't even that good
[0:47:54] <%LastHazzerd> just hand the mods loaded guns
[0:47:59] <CrimsonGargoyle> exactly quite the opposite, i hope you do your own thing. it'd be boring if it was the same
[0:48:01] <%Jack8274> We don't care about formulas man, we care about you two

[0:48:03] <%dreadedcthulhu> this is part of why I'm glad y'all's old channel was on my peripherals and I only started actively following this year, my expectations are just for something enjoyable
[0:48:03] <%aram909> every person's yakuza experience is going to be different
[0:48:03] <bigshedman> @WoolieVersus Give new LP but also be exactly like old LP
[0:48:05] <%ZweihanderSteve> it shouldn't, and people who do should feel bad
[0:48:08] <DatAsuna> Never forget pat insisting on pumping HP in bloodborne lol
[0:48:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Hell yeah I‚Äôm just excited to see y‚Äôall play
[0:48:09] <%PR0swagonist> ohsnap, thanks @aram909
[0:48:09] <%DemonOfSalt> @LastHazzerd This.
[0:48:13] <BimboBagging> I thought he just meant having someone who knows a lot of the game to show as much
[0:48:14] <%aram909> so it really doesn't matter, don't compare it to other LPs/Streams
[0:48:15] <%RioGascar> i think it will be interesting, especially since i never played demon souls (cause had a 360 and ps3 was not worth the costs)
[0:48:19] <%BinaryFireball> will reggie be playing?
[0:48:20] <Rawbone_saw> Hell yea >:D i cant wait!
[0:48:26] <%RyuuAoi> There would have been a better option when Woolie played DS with Pat too. But Woolie played. So have a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up. Enjoy the video games!
[0:48:26] <%gatorafan> baby jail might be needed for Yakuza
[0:48:28] <$Plus_On_Black> Aka shut the fuck up and watch.
[0:48:28] <+Wessuri> New Demon's Souls, New Me
[0:48:29] <DatAsuna> The hotswapping for bloodborne was both the best and the worst lol
[0:48:29] <+TheotherKristian> Ban guns on the ready
[0:48:31] <%Terrarp> Just don't let Reggie grind off camera and show up with 30 more levels
[0:48:32] <%Jack8274> @DatAsuna He was right
[0:48:34] <prime_name> Just get salty and pay Woolie to yell at him.
[0:48:35] <+vaderxyz1970> Drop your shield REGGIE
[0:48:35] <%DemonOfSalt> @bigshedman woolieYE
[0:48:35] <%ekodrop> prepare to have headaches reggie
[0:48:36] <%jiggy_snipe> good
[0:48:39] <Jester3609> We have fun as viewers when you have fun with the game. That's all that matters man!
[0:48:41] <PrideOfFiddles> There will be Reggie & Woolie & that's what matters :)
[0:48:41] <%superc37> @woolieversus sorry and ye i figured as much, i just thought id ask since i like spy and think he would be fun to watch with yall :v
[0:48:41] <skewerstar> Woolie VS Cabaret club that was skipped in the LP! LET'S GOOOO!
[0:48:42] <$Invlux> Reggie WILL die a lot
[0:48:42] <%ZweihanderSteve> I just want to playthrough where you're having fun BibleThump
[0:48:43] <@Menitta> I will be shooting Yakuza spoilers on sight.
[0:48:43] <%jiggy_snipe> be like Plague lol
[0:48:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> no hip guiding
[0:48:44] <%ggbhtg> This is WOOLIE'S LP, not PAT PART 2
[0:48:44] <Saberkai> i'm just tryin' to watch yall play some games tbh
[0:48:47] <%alphalejandro> For Yakuza 0 just focus on the main plot, it's fine
[0:48:50] <Pookiedaexzile> You won't sherpa....You will push him towards the stick
[0:48:51] <redrins> also no dropping weapons for reggie CHAT
[0:48:53] <%RyuuAoi> REGGIE READY. HE GONNA GET FUKT
[0:48:55] <Saberkai> doesnt matter what i just like haning out
[0:48:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Pointy stick
[0:48:57] <%ggbhtg> This is WOOLIE'S LP, not PAT 2ND GIG
[0:48:59] <%BinaryFireball> Reggie you gotta go full Reggie with these games don't hold back. Don't let woolie stop you
[0:49:00] <Saberkai> hanging*
[0:49:01] <%aram909> @alphalejandro there are a few substories that are a must though
[0:49:01] <%jv5_guy> play more mario kart live lol
[0:49:06] <RinWR> Believe when we say we want it that way
[0:49:11] <DatAsuna> Demon's remains my favourite souls game, and the atmosphere is a big part of it
[0:49:12] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus So in other words you are fully prepared to toss Reggie under the bus
[0:49:13] <derap41> Reggie gonna do Souls games=
[0:49:17] <derap41> ?
[0:49:20] <%guyalex> couldn't be more excited for these lps to happen in your style, you guys have done great so keep it up
[0:49:22] <%cache_22> I cannot wait for coy Woolie. I also cannot wait to see Reggie's reaction. woolieSMUG
[0:49:25] <$Spydurman> @WoolieVersus After seeing so making "hips guided" Dark Souls LP's it'll be refreshing to see a blind run for once
[0:49:27] <%BinaryFireball> German Spy is dope and you people should go follow him
[0:49:27] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck playing souls games for an audience. I would lose my mind
[0:49:33] <%RioGascar> I guess the concern is, will you step in if things get out of control or far too hard for reggie? i think that is the concern
[0:49:38] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie will guide the hips, but Reggie will take the hits.
[0:49:39] <%ekodrop> can we have a 2 hour character creator session?/
[0:49:41] <skewerstar> Time for Get into MAHJONG AND SHOGI! LUL
[0:49:42] <%ggbhtg> "This is MY story, and shield dropping is not part of it" @woolieversus
[0:49:45] <Rawbone_saw> "put your sheild down...there ya go"
[0:49:55] <Rawbone_saw> LMAO
[0:49:58] <+RunoEddie> this is not KOTOR2, just let Reggie play free
[0:49:58] <@Menitta> "Dont fuck with Yakuza fans. We have no idea how to play Mahjong"
[0:50:01] <derap41> You can play the game not knowing anything about it
[0:50:04] <%doomerskeletor13> Very excited for the full streams of Mahjong
[0:50:09] <Gelphaze> Just have fun, that's what matters.
[0:50:14] <Rawbone_saw> ^
[0:50:15] <+Jakev91489> ^
[0:50:16] <%RioGascar> @menitta Pocket racer go BRRRRRT
[0:50:17] <derap41> In fact you should play the game not knowing shit about it
[0:50:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Yakuza Fans Everywhere System
[0:50:20] <%RyuuAoi> You're gonna suffer, Reggie. Just prepare your asshole. woolieKICKDAD
[0:50:21] <+cvp5127> good
[0:50:23] <%X2Eliah> .... So basically Woolie will let Reggie start with a completely effed unviable build
[0:50:27] <+Wessuri> our ancestors played souls game blind, and so can we
[0:50:28] <%alphonseisbest> @Menitta someone's een the subreddit LUL
[0:50:28] <%superc37> @woolieversus sorry and ye i figured as much, i just thought id ask since i like spy and think he would be fun to watch with yall regardless of the old lps
[0:50:28] <DatAsuna> An important disclaimer that nobody will hear
[0:50:28] <SomersaultJustice> PLAY MAHJONG
[0:50:31] <PrideOfFiddles> It will be fun
[0:50:35] <%alphalejandro> @Gelphaze And that's all that matter
[0:50:35] <$Invlux> have ya heard about SOFT CAPS and BREAK POINTS Kappa
[0:50:36] <SomersaultJustice> WE'LL HELP YOU, JUST PLAY MAHJONG
[0:50:39] <Rawbone_saw> i cant wait to see what weapon he likes
[0:50:40] <%ggbhtg> Clip this segment, put it at the start of the LP @woolieversus
[0:50:40] <prime_name> Just paste this clip infront of the Demon's souls LP when it hits youtube
[0:50:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Des doesn't have alot of broken Builds
[0:50:51] <JetpackMcQuack> advice :)
[0:50:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Most things are viable
[0:50:54] <Rawbone_saw> my favorite part of woolie playing ds1 was his love for the partizan
[0:50:57] <%Irridium> "advice"
[0:50:57] <%Jack8274> @X2Eliah Those don't exist in demons souls, a base weapon with base stats can beat the game
[0:50:59] <%gatorafan> inb4 Reggie crushes it
[0:50:59] <thepappdaddy> When Minecraft playthrough? MaxLOL MaxLOL
[0:51:00] <%ekodrop> be prepared for chat to be wrong all the time
[0:51:01] <%doomerskeletor13> I have never once played Mahjong in all 8 of the Yakuza games I‚Äôve played
[0:51:02] <@Menitta> DeS is also pretty easy all things considered
[0:51:04] <+BigBruthaThunda> The need to have this preamble for this community is sad
[0:51:05] <DatAsuna> Don't let anyone pen you into a build, yeah
[0:51:07] <Solidnick18> okay
[0:51:07] <%X2Eliah> Ah, okay. That's cool.
[0:51:10] <bigshedman> LUL
[0:51:13] <+Jakev91489> @ekodrop So, every stream?
[0:51:17] <%Jack8274> Even if you pump luck only you can do a blue blood build
[0:51:19] <%ekodrop> yup
[0:51:22] <DatAsuna> Even if you do a wishy washy !quality build" you can still manage
[0:51:22] <velgaduere> this almost feels like a generational handoff. I'm looking forward to it
[0:51:26] <%RioGascar> Honestly with yakuza, i dont really think you‚Äôll have any issue. the games signposting and guidance for how to do things and where content is is pretty clear
[0:51:30] <@Menitta> PogChamp
[0:51:39] <%ggbhtg> It's wack but fun
[0:51:48] <%ggbhtg> Let's see if Parsec works
[0:51:54] <%LionheartedRebel> i mean, yeah, you have to in that case
[0:51:55] <%RyuuAoi> More garbage though. Please, @woolieversus. Bring back Saturday Morning Scrublords!
[0:51:59] <prime_name> Mai will be Bai

[0:52:23] <Pookiedaexzile> This is correct
[0:52:23] <+Beebo_Brebo> smart move
[0:52:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Smart
[0:52:29] <SerRule1> Hey Woolie, you know about Martial Masters right? When you playing that?
[0:52:34] <%Irridium> Play Dead Souls Kappa
[0:52:35] <GoogleyGareth> LUL
[0:52:37] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL

[0:53:06] <Cykron> What a hero
[0:53:12] <Pookiedaexzile> or the Zombie ones
[0:53:16] <%RyuuAoi> Weather you like it or not, Woolie is gonna be Woolie, and we love him for it!
[0:53:17] <%BinaryFireball> there's a looooooot of yakuza too much to stream all at once
[0:53:19] <%cache_22> Meanwhile my FedEx guy throws stuff at the door and runs.
[0:53:25] <+cvp5127> again?
[0:53:25] <+vaderxyz1970> ohhhh nooo
[0:53:26] <%RioGascar> Its hard to get good drivers for delivery. Especially now when shipping is stacked as fuck
[0:53:27] <GoogleyGareth> daaamn
[0:53:28] <DatAsuna> People who youtube the weaker games are the ones who then criticise said games mechanics in the most cringe uninformed ways.
[0:53:30] <%RyuuAoi> @cache_22 Same
[0:53:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh yeah
[0:53:31] <%Jack8274> Zero was an amazing introduction for me.

[0:53:37] <JetpackMcQuack> Apartments are sketch
[0:53:41] <%ekodrop> they forge the signature
[0:53:41] <GoogleyGareth> Some motherfuckers just dont care.
[0:53:42] <%ggbhtg> Naisuuuuu....
[0:53:43] <derap41> I don't understand how the US can deliver shit like that
[0:53:50] <derap41> or CA
[0:53:56] <ManJazzSSBM> the US is in dire straits
[0:53:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh wait it happened again?
[0:54:02] <%RyuuAoi> So the Sex Box NOW ZThe tv

[0:54:08] <%Jack8274> Thet do it at my apartment, there are packages in front of doors all the time
[0:54:14] <Cykron> With everyone terrified of COVID I can hardly blame them
[0:54:14] <@Menitta> Yakuza 0 is technically a PS3 game. Anything is fine.
[0:54:31] <joshua_42> Real Yakuza Use Gamepad
[0:54:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> fuck heaven then
[0:54:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> As do i

[0:54:59] <%RyuuAoi> Well to hell I go.
[0:55:01] <%RioGascar> The only argument i have for them is...having worked for fedex the amount of furniture i had to carry up apartment stairs only to knock and no answer and HAVE TO DRAG IT BACK DOWN CAUSE I NEED A SIGNATURE. It really makes you wanna just chuck the thing at the door
[0:55:11] <T_Sasquatch> Slavery

[0:58:02] <+RunoEddie> @RioGascar like, this is how shipping works around here, the deliveryman calls the apartment to see if anyone's around, and then if someone answers they bring the stuff from the truck

[1:03:16] <OldManDeckardCain> perfect season pass to kill the game more like
[1:03:19] <+Jakev91489> The Zappa movie just came out, it was awesome
[1:03:21] <Nekros4442> There has to at least 1 original character
[1:03:21] <phatmac16> Woolie would design a loli he hates
[1:03:26] <SomersaultJustice> but jam tho
[1:03:26] <%Superbro64> r Kappa doesnt actually play games tho
[1:03:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Cool but Zappa tho

[1:03:46] <YakumoYomi> I have mixed feelings about fighting games adding "veterans" as paid DLC
[1:03:46] <%alphalejandro> I know that people don't care but Zappa is out lore wise, he's not a fighter anymore
[1:03:50] <JetpackMcQuack> imagination is hard tho
[1:03:51] <%Superbro64> Did anyone actually like the new characters in Xrd tho? @woolieversus
[1:03:54] <%Javaa01> This is your brain on Unga

[1:04:10] <BimboBagging> And then you get SF III
[1:04:10] <%Superbro64> people HATE HATE HATED Elphelt and most did not like the new characters Woolie @woolieversus
[1:04:15] <Pookiedaexzile> You want a new Guilty Gear character pick a Standard Hallowween costume and add shit on it
[1:04:23] <Blank9> why not all the old thing, and more, for the new game?
[1:04:24] <SomersaultJustice> I liked elphelt : (
[1:04:24] <%jiggy_snipe> I think people like Leo and Ram
[1:04:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> BRING BRIDGET BACK! FOR r/Kappa FOLKS
[1:04:26] <phatmac16> But what if the new charcter sucks

[1:04:29] <%jiggy_snipe> Elp is cool
[1:04:30] <%PR0swagonist> i mean, you think a random poster is going to shove in a new character?
[1:04:34] <%Superbro64> In particular with the example with GG and with how Xrd went
[1:04:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> BRIDGET IS THE QUEEN OF r/Kappa

[1:10:13] <DatAsuna> I would fear OT god
[1:10:16] <Mr_Strut> Yandere god

[1:18:50] <+panlakes> is this one of those strand games I've heard about
[1:19:31] <ManJazzSSBM> Chat: What is a strand game?
[1:19:40] <%X2Eliah> Kojima game?
[1:19:43] <+starzo0> nobody knows
[1:19:57] <andrewofbob> DMC with Nero is a stand game
[1:19:58] <ManJazzSSBM> is Melee a strand game
[1:20:00] <%RyTYoung> @manjazzssbm Ah, you must mean the new genre created by our over lord Kojumbo!
[1:20:03] <bigshedman> If you need to ask that question, you wouldn't understand the answer. It's very deep, you see Kappa
[1:20:17] <ManJazzSSBM> like rick and morty ahh
[1:20:24] <+Ipsenscastle> Knuckles Chaotix was the first strand game
[1:20:37] <andrewofbob> The real question is, is Ratatouille a movie about a chef with a stand?
[1:20:38] <%RyTYoung> @ipsenscastle Actually that would be Pong
[1:20:41] <+starzo0> to be fair, you need a high IQ to understand god emperor kojumbo
[1:20:55] <%RyTYoung> Pong connects people you see
[1:21:06] <%ChoculaUltra> is tetris a strand game?
[1:21:06] <bigshedman> Learn at least five different saksik languages and then come back to me.
[1:21:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:21:11] <%SegaDSi> Remember to jump on enemies
[1:21:18] <+panlakes> this game facilitates the bridge that connects us all as humanity
[1:21:22] <+starzo0> ratatouille is about a rat with a stand using a human as a mech @andrewofbob
[1:21:25] <@SoushinSen> @X2Eliah Montrela is in lockdown, only one visitor is allowed per household. therefore, i haven't been there,
[1:21:28] <ManJazzSSBM> remember, to win, achieve victory
[1:21:33] <%RyTYoung> @choculaultra I mean you use strands to make big connections so ye
[1:21:35] <%X2Eliah> Ah.
[1:21:41] <Cykron> This track reminds me of Evangelion for some reason
[1:21:41] <bigshedman> @ChoculaUltra Yes, it is. Did you know that the 'Tetr' in Tetris means 'four'?!

[1:28:25] <%alphalejandro> Bring the old tv back! LUL
[1:28:30] <Darren716> The Wii has a setting that changes if the wii bar is on top or on the bottom of the tv
[1:28:31] <%ZweihanderSteve> if anything in my need to be closer to the actual bottom of the TV, but I'm not too sure
[1:28:41] <bigshedman> I think the Wii has specific settings regarding the Sensor Bar, and recalibrating should also help.
[1:28:41] <heartlesshealer> gotta have that CRT for wii sensor bar
[1:29:01] <heartlesshealer> Also yes, you can recalibrate sensor bar for below television
[1:29:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> AW

[1:51:07] <+starzo0> just get your older brother to beat it for you
[1:51:10] <%Asuterisuku> When sliding the controls reorient towards Mario's left and right instead of that of the camrea, I think.
[1:51:26] <%Asuterisuku> So towards the wall would be to Mario's left.
[1:51:35] <%X2Eliah> ooof

[1:57:08] <%alphalejandro> Oh...good luck guys
[1:57:47] <%Jack8274> You need to recalibrate
[1:57:52] <%Asuterisuku> IR pointers always having a point of reference is handy.
[1:58:04] <%cache_22> I'm so glad modern motion controls no longer need sensor bars.
[1:58:31] <%Asuterisuku> I dunno, the wii pointer still seems more reliable than the joycons' gyro pointer.

[2:05:52] <SomersaultJustice> just be the best 4Head
[2:05:53] <tanarath> @woolieversus You need to chain jumps
[2:06:00] <velgaduere> maybe just spin attack murdering the enemies up top will be enough to do it, no combo needed?
[2:06:08] <%SegaDSi> Its fine if you dont waste 20 secons wall jumping
[2:06:09] <tanarath> a 4 combo = 10 indivifuals
[2:06:25] <tanarath> The final circles alone might be enough

[2:12:14] <%X2Eliah> Like historical significance, okay
[2:12:17] <CrematedCube> 98 and 07 were milestone years
[2:12:23] <%Asuterisuku> Say what you will, Half-Life still plays well.
[2:12:24] <Slim_Lipid> nah it's fine, they keep remaking them
[2:12:32] <+eanscrale> Well of course they did, it was like the beginning of time
[2:12:35] <+itrobthebot> 2007 was crazy year too
[2:12:39] <%Irridium> so many huge franchises now started in 1998
[2:12:41] <SomersaultJustice> but I thought rewinding was lame though Kappa
[2:12:49] <magitwit> naw my year of games is 2004. kingdom hearts, world of warcraft, pokemon and the gameboy sp
[2:12:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 2018 and 2019 were pretty great years as well
[2:13:03] <velgaduere> yeah 2007 was crazy. Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn? WILD

[2:13:20] <velgaduere> @Menitta even Toy Story looked better
[2:13:21] <CrematedCube> 2003 was the other pivotal year in my book
[2:13:22] <%RyuuAoi> Learned some speed tech for 64 last night when you're going up those hills. KICK
[2:13:37] <CrematedCube> more in anime than games tho
[2:14:03] <%Asuterisuku> Almost saved it.
[2:14:04] <andrewofbob> Also, a lot of speedrun tech is because of Quake 3, a lot of game engines are based on it, like Source

[2:14:43] <Darren716> Man remember wiggler wednesdays?
[2:14:50] <velgaduere> no Wigglers in Whomp's Fortress 64, immersion annihilated
[2:15:00] <SomersaultJustice> iirc, I think they fixed that luigi slide cancel thing from galaxy 1 in this game right?
[2:15:02] <%RyuuAoi> Oh man so many fucking memories in this one.
[2:15:31] <+masterMau> can i get a gamers gotta game???
[2:15:37] <%Asuterisuku> At the start of this Woolie said something about Luigi not being playable in Galaxy 1 and I was like "what are you talking about, he's half the game?"

[2:16:31] <tanarath> It'd be like Woolie losing a pinky.
[2:16:32] <%X2Eliah> Woolie, do you have baldness in your future? Or will it be dreads until like 90 years old?

[2:25:26] <%Asuterisuku> I ain't gonna let it get to me, I'm just gonna creep.

[2:27:03] <@Menitta> I like 3D World more than Galaxy 2 tbh
[2:27:07] <%ChoculaUltra> its spacy and spooky sounding
[2:27:25] <%Asuterisuku> The 3DW Switch Port has my attention. I wonder what's going to be in the new world.
[2:27:42] <%RyuuAoi> @asuterisuku Imma cop it
[2:27:48] <@Menitta> the increased speed in 3D World justifies that purchase for me
[2:27:54] <%SegaDSi> Little Bro needs his Health extention AND big bro helping him.
[2:27:55] <whirly25> the light has been with you all along! (mass produced evas attack)
[2:27:59] <%RyuuAoi> @asuterisuku That multiplayer was pretty amazing
[2:28:04] <velgaduere> just enough coins
[2:28:05] <@Menitta> also my wii u is in the closet
[2:28:12] <%ChoculaUltra> has Nintendo said anything about a 3d Mario Maker with like Galaxy/Sunshine shit?
[2:28:33] <+starzo0> everyones wii u is in a closet
[2:28:43] <+starzo0> unless its a door stop
[2:28:46] <andrewofbob> FEED
[2:28:51] <Darren716> Oh shit this one
[2:28:52] <%Asuterisuku> 3D Marios aren't built on the same kind of tile based system as the 2D stuff. It's not something that hasn't been done before, but it sure wouldn't be easy.
[2:28:56] <CrematedCube> Oh yeah this
[2:29:06] <%Asuterisuku> Volvagia just ate part of the planet.
[2:29:06] <velgaduere> you fought the green version
[2:29:11] <%RyuuAoi> @menitta Mine is sitting right in front of me but not plugged in. Get urges to play Bayo constantly. Pretty sure the game pad dead af
[2:29:12] <SomersaultJustice> he's back, in fire form
[2:29:13] <%SegaDSi> Oh F this fight
[2:29:16] <%Asuterisuku> 3D Mario's traditional end-game Boss Rush.
[2:29:17] <CrematedCube> Boss #1, fire-red version
[2:29:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Like A Dragon
[2:29:26] <%ChoculaUltra> v true, a build your own mario game but with 3d assets/worlds would be a monumental task for Nintendo
[2:30:13] <CrematedCube> That Animal Crossing whistle gets me every time
[2:30:23] <stevenellis386> reminds me of the fire medallion boss fight in legend of Zelda:Oot
[2:30:40] <Equirah> so turns out wollie was super wrong about the cashew thing, a simple google search shows the cashew apple is not toxic and indeed is consumed as a fruit or used to make beverages LUL

[2:31:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Lay it all on him
[2:31:23] <velgaduere> this Luma is really profiting off of this specific boss fight
[2:31:23] <%SegaDSi> Coo, thing is Luma pathgs are permenantly opened
[2:31:25] <ManJazzSSBM> F O I L E D
[2:31:27] <andrewofbob> Know the startup on your heals
[2:32:36] <%ChoculaUltra> in retrospect - Mario has fought almost every kind of monster/boss you can think of.
[2:32:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1333707739751718914
[2:32:46] <%RyuuAoi> Serpentine
[2:32:57] <%ChoculaUltra> dragons, lizard kings, ghosts, sentient bullets, sea monsters, etc
[2:33:22] <%SegaDSi> You Cant just run in a straight line for this guy
[2:33:25] <%X2Eliah> But has Mario fought the Police?
[2:33:27] <andrewofbob> Has Mario fought a Vergil?
[2:33:28] <velgaduere> if you fire too many star bits, you can't buy armor again
[2:33:39] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie, remember....football
[2:33:49] <%ChoculaUltra> I actually don't know - has Mario actually fought Wario as a boss?
[2:33:51] <Cykron> @X2Eliah He's Italian after all
[2:33:57] <%ChoculaUltra> preferably shirtless in the rain?
[2:34:10] <%RyuuAoi> @choculaultra Probably
[2:34:16] <andrewofbob> Shirtless in the mud, final offer
[2:34:18] <%SegaDSi> A Piece of Advice for this Fight,Save the Easy bubbles for the 2nd phase
[2:34:31] <+whats_all_this_then> I don't think I've seen the second player cursor for this game in 10 years
[2:34:32] <SomersaultJustice> @ChoculaUltra Super Mario Land 2
[2:34:39] <CrematedCube> Overall I'd consider this the most challenging fight in the game
[2:34:44] <%ChoculaUltra> @SomersaultJustice ty!
[2:34:58] <%RyuuAoi> Too greedy, Woolie
[2:35:10] <%RyuuAoi> Treat it like Dark Souls.
[2:35:31] <SomersaultJustice> CHILDREN'S GAME
[2:35:32] <%Asuterisuku> Play it like you're playing Snake.
[2:35:46] <%Asuterisuku> If he crosses under himself he will attack you.
[2:36:19] <%SegaDSi> Oh Without a Doubt this is the hardest boss in the game, only thing to match Daredevil Boulder guy and Davedevil Kamella form 1
[2:36:30] <%RyuuAoi> WE DO IT
[2:36:30] <@Menitta> YES
[2:36:31] <velgaduere> NICE
[2:36:35] <%SegaDSi> Nice
[2:36:36] <Rawbone_saw> ayyyyy

[2:36:45] <+paladinstarbuster> was it?
[2:36:50] <whirly25> now he has to grant you a wish
[2:36:51] <+starzo0> PogChamp
[2:36:58] <CrematedCube> The game is taking those gloves off
[2:37:09] <%RyuuAoi> No one said it be easy! woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:37:10] <WakeUpThrow> I don't remember it being this relentless, holy shit
[2:37:13] <%alphalejandro> For the children
[2:37:14] <velgaduere> Rated E for Experts
[2:37:30] <%Asuterisuku> People always have that misunderstanding about the ratings.
[2:37:46] <SomersaultJustice> after this is done, someone should give him a complete save file so he can try perfect run
[2:37:52] <%RyuuAoi> Hey big spender KappaPride
[2:37:56] <CrematedCube> Remember, this game was designed for people who thought Galaxy 1 was too easy
[2:38:10] <%Asuterisuku> Also that boss wasn't optional.
[2:38:12] <velgaduere> we don't need to give bankers any more power than they already have
[2:38:33] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:38:43] <%alphalejandro> Lost Levels
[2:38:45] <%Asuterisuku> Hence my earlier comparison: Super Mario Galaxy: The Lost Levels
[2:38:48] <%Jack8274> Since Super Mario World
[2:38:51] <tanarath> Challenge mods are a thing
[2:38:53] <%RyuuAoi> I mean....old school is a challenge still today.
[2:39:04] <+jmcclellan18> Mario Odyssey is pretty easy but everything after you beat the final boss in super hard
[2:39:10] <%SegaDSi> The kirby method
[2:39:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I dunno, world 7 of SMB3 was way harder than world 8.
[2:39:24] <%Jack8274> @jmcclellan18 and there is more content post then pre end game. I loved oddesy for that
[2:39:42] <%RyuuAoi> KIRBY IS BEAST THOUGH.
[2:39:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:39:47] <%Asuterisuku> Sakurai a genius.
[2:39:54] <+eanscrale> That's what killed bomberman
[2:40:06] <%RyuuAoi> Naw. Kirby Bosses fuck you.
[2:40:08] <WakeUpThrow> Kirby's boss rushes are brutal
[2:40:10] <SuperFightinRobot> But kirby also gets rough with stuff like the true arena
[2:40:12] <%Jack8274> Here we go lol
[2:40:13] <%Juriasu> woolieLORE
[2:40:15] <CrematedCube> I grew up with Kirby 64 so I'm laughing
[2:40:18] <velgaduere> put some respec on that name
[2:40:26] <Jaxnos> it's dead easy until you want the actual ending and then Kirby games say "aha, you thought"
[2:40:39] <%Asuterisuku> I respect that.
[2:40:47] <SuperFightinRobot> @CrematedCube I just got my roomate to beat Zero Two last night. I love that game.
[2:40:58] <%Asuterisuku> That's what the little Luma floating around Mario is after you spin.
[2:41:02] <SomersaultJustice> it does the luma thing
[2:41:06] <@Menitta> He has the animation

[2:42:42] <@Menitta> Sonic rings being life is the least fun imo
[2:43:04] <%X2Eliah> Tbh a whole lot of things about Sonic are the least fun
[2:43:07] <tanarath> Mario 64/Halo 1 depending on the situation
[2:43:15] <tanarath> Maybe RE4
[2:43:43] <%SegaDSi> Sonic Rush has my favourite, Ech Hit you take makes the rings fly farther. so the 1 ring rule gets harder as the fight goes
[2:44:04] <townzzzzz> the worst game health thing is having a life bar but dying in one hit no matter what
[2:44:13] <tanarath> gears is garbage
[2:44:19] <CrematedCube> @SegaDSi Huh, never knew that and it explains a lot
[2:44:20] <tanarath> Halo 1 was fine

[2:50:05] <misterurbanthelegend> PogChamp
[2:50:15] <%SegaDSi> Usain Bolt was decapitated by the goal line. More at 11
[2:50:18] <+MTLxSpider> twitch are u daijokay
[2:50:19] <PFlare> He dusted you.
[2:50:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> twitch is not daijobu
[2:50:45] <glass_marcus> follo the star bits
[2:50:52] <%Asuterisuku> You can go further around than the immediate thirty degrees you've been on.
[2:51:10] <%SegaDSi> Your meant to go left there Wools
[2:51:42] <tanarath> @woolieversus You need to rotate more.
[2:51:45] <+xeros720> i think you want to be diving all the time
[2:51:47] <velgaduere> Mario with the seppuku
[2:51:48] <tanarath> Follow him
[2:51:48] <%SegaDSi> Now cyanide
[2:52:00] <andrewofbob> You can second, now you die
[2:52:06] <andrewofbob> Came
[2:52:08] <SomersaultJustice> just be perfect 4Head
[2:52:14] <Afterman_> @woolieversus have you played the switch version of dmc3? I just bought it and Holy shit the free style switch is a game changer
[2:52:26] <+xerotwo> O O P A H H doodLUL
[2:52:26] <+starzo0> LUL
[2:52:30] <SomersaultJustice> Thwomped
[2:52:34] <%Asuterisuku> He got in here with a lot mor height and had a lot more speed in the straightaway.
[2:52:34] <+xeros720> that was a good run tho
[2:53:13] <%cisealnine> cisealnine subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! The side quests are the best part about Yakuza (in my opinion). If you get a chance, ask around to people that you trust for some of the best ones for LP purposes (without spoilers of course - not knowing makes them better).
[2:53:22] <+xeros720> and so Reggie started blasting
[2:53:38] <+starzo0> @cisealnine pat is way ahead of you on that
[2:53:44] <%Asuterisuku> Getting hit there cost you.
[2:53:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> almost
[2:53:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:54:05] <Mr_Strut> Get that to sub 60
[2:54:07] <tanarath> Getting hit ends you, kinda
[2:54:15] <%cisealnine> @starzo0 I just wanted to make sure.
[2:54:33] <%X2Eliah> So this is like, dont ever get hit and do all dives perfectly or you lose
[2:55:00] <Ner234> That was scary. Did Twitch bug out for anyone else just now? All my "Followed Channels" just disappeared suddenly. It's back now tho.
[2:55:03] <Slim_Lipid> Perfect Run OpieOP
[2:55:03] <+xeros720> this may be the last one, i can't recall tho
[2:55:07] <SomersaultJustice> Perfect Run you say Kappa
[2:55:13] <tanarath> Nah, not perfect, just use height well & don't get hit
[2:55:32] <CrematedCube> Diving too early
[2:55:34] <%SegaDSi> The trick is Get the dive state but dont dive too far
[2:55:41] <%ekodrop> losing more time by hitting walls
[2:55:46] <%Asuterisuku> You can use the speed from the dive to climb a bit and not lose too much.
[2:55:54] <%Asuterisuku> So long as you don't hit the bottom.
[2:55:59] <CrematedCube> Save height early and use it later
[2:56:02] <+xeros720> yeah, avoiding walls seems more important, you lose so much
[2:56:09] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie needs to give up the ghost and play L4D and L4D2!
[2:56:27] <DerpioParty> That bird has such a horrid scream
[2:56:41] <Rawbone_saw> i like it :3

[2:57:59] <%Asuterisuku> Don't get hit.

[2:59:48] <%Asuterisuku> Galaxy 1 and 2 on Wii rely on the pointer and cannot use the gamecube controller, at least on original hardware.
[2:59:57] <%Asuterisuku> I know the Switch version of 1 changed things up a bit.

[3:04:36] <mothdude> Finding Rosalina in this game is such a huge task

Also to comment on something on the podcast... the reason why Injustice 2 runs like trash is partly because it runs on a heavily modified Unreal 3 Game Engine

[3:15:04] <nintega010> If nintendo ever wanted to make Bowser hard. the amount of powers he has
[3:15:08] <CrematedCube> I'm now thinking of Bowser's slick wedding hair
[3:15:22] <T_Sasquatch> tried the new wonderful 101 demo ..... yea .... no
[3:15:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:15:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> Reggiekage Kira and his Stand, Killer Feet
[3:15:42] <T_Sasquatch> that game is so clearly made for a specific type of input device
[3:15:51] <PhantomMaskJr> larxaLurk Hail Bowser
[3:15:53] <%SegaDSi> Galaxy 1's bowser fight was so much better than this one
[3:16:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> please don't tell me you tried using the touch controls
[3:16:03] <PhantomMaskJr> No it‚Äôs not
[3:16:11] <%Zayasu> @T_Sasquatch you mean for the wioi u tablet?
[3:16:15] <%Zayasu> wii u*
[3:16:22] <%Jack8274> Could you use gravity to loop it around?
[3:16:35] <@Menitta> yeah I vastly prefer Galaxy 1's final boss
[3:16:41] <Darren716> Nope
[3:16:47] <%Asuterisuku> W101 was definitely made with the gamepad in mind.
[3:16:49] <+starzo0> eventually, bowser stopped thinking

[3:18:29] <WakeUpThrow> Really wished the fight was longer. Music deserves more than that
[3:18:35] <+xeros720> it's a real neat sequence, but they should've done more with it
[3:18:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @tanarath

[3:23:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "We really were the Super Mario Galaxy 2"
[3:23:38] <%TheSaltminer> while we're talking about threats, can we talk about Pauline? Sees Peach, actual princess, decides NAH FUCK THAT, and abuses her powers as MAYOR OF NEW DONK to get the entire city on board with a musical number about wanting to be Mario's One Up Girl
[3:23:40] <Mr_Strut> Not Fate!
[3:23:46] <%Jetzord> Peach is just taking off her heels and earrings off screen
[3:24:02] <Darren716> Let the child die
[3:24:08] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie definitely has to do 3D World.

[3:25:23] <%alphalejandro> Why?
[3:25:23] <%Javaa01> @RyuuAoi We got to the ending, but this is far from 100%
[3:25:27] <DerpioParty> Mario's head's all itchy now
[3:25:31] <redrins> if this was a kirby game he would 100% be the bad guy
[3:25:32] <SomersaultJustice> my name isn't lubba, it's MARX!
[3:25:34] <Darren716> Woolie beat like 30% of the game
[3:25:35] <CrematedCube> congrats on Ending A
[3:25:41] <nintega010> @RyuuAoi yes, but not the 100% ending
[3:25:43] <Slim_Lipid> 58%

[3:26:17] <%SegaDSi> I want woolie to die in the credits
[3:26:26] <%Jack8274> Yep, now we know why bowser got so far

[3:38:16] <%Asuterisuku> Lubba has something to say.
[3:38:16] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus There's something dope at the back of the ship, apparently?
[3:38:21] <mothdude> Perma-Luigi??
[3:38:25] <damienlunas> "Look bro, if you're ever getting tired of slamming Peach, I can switch with you any time bro!"
[3:38:35] <%RyuuAoi> LOL Woolie said fuck it!
[3:38:44] <%ekodrop> roselina sucks
[3:38:47] <Darren716> Because you gotta push Lubba for summer slam

[3:38:52] <+EdenOfLove> no cap
[3:38:53] <%Javaa01> Rosalina is your reward for completion, you gotta be dedicated for your queen
[3:38:53] <%alphalejandro> Who...Daisy?
[3:38:53] <Emperor_Machinus> What about Daisy?
[3:38:59] <Darren716> Also Rosalina is your incentive to get 252
[3:38:59] <mothdude> Gotta get all 242 stars to meet Rosalina.
[3:39:00] <glass_marcus> Artificial Scarcity
[3:39:01] <+paladinstarbuster> THAT AINT DAISY
[3:39:01] <Darren716> *242
[3:39:01] <%Jetzord> Woolie stans a Queeh

[3:39:17] <%ggbhtg> Fuck Daisy, Marry Rosalina, KILL PEACH
[3:39:19] <CrematedCube> Rosalina is your reward in this game
[3:39:20] <%Asuterisuku> Pauline is now a democratic leader and Mario doesn't like that.
[3:39:23] <%ggbhtg> Fuck Daisy, Marry Rosalina, KILL PEACH. @WoolieVersus
[3:39:23] <DatAsuna> "Hi, I'm Daisy!"
[3:39:24] <NotHereToStream> preach
[3:39:25] <+paladinstarbuster> ITS NOT
[3:39:28] <CrematedCube> You gotta work to see her
[3:39:30] <%alphalejandro> Nobody cares about Rosi
[3:39:32] <%RyuuAoi> SUNSHINE U COWARDS
[3:39:33] <SomersaultJustice> rosalina's dress is kinda plain
[3:39:36] <%SegaDSi> I want to see woolies reaction to the perect run, just watching him see a video of it on his phone would be enough
[3:39:37] <ShiningAxis> Galaxy 2 was around the time Nintendo starting really cutting down the stories and characters in their games
[3:39:38] <+EdenOfLove> Rosalina aint gonna mess with no 72 star owner she only goes for those 242 star chads
[3:39:39] <tanarath> If you want Rosealina, get 242.
[3:39:39] <%Jack8274> He loves his woman, don't hate on the guy
[3:39:43] <Zebroneath> Straight FACTS
[3:39:43] <%RyuuAoi> COWARDS
[3:39:45] <%ggbhtg> Fuck Daisy, Marry Rosalina, KILL PEACH @WoolieVersus
[3:39:47] <Darren716> I like Rosalina's smash design more
[3:39:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> Based Rosachads
[3:39:54] <Darren716> Where she has the star pattern
[3:39:54] <The_err0r> But that‚Äôs his daughter
[3:39:55] <Jaxnos> Rosalina don't need no broke star-man
[3:39:55] <Explodincatz> so which one is the upgrade? Reggie or Woolie?
[3:39:58] <Rawbone_saw> yea where was she at tho?

[3:40:13] <%alphalejandro> Shigeru?
[3:40:14] <+EdenOfLove> woolie will never get to play as rosalina because he didnt get 242
[3:40:19] <CrematedCube> Rosalina's too high a tier for you in this game
[3:40:21] <%Asuterisuku> Rosalina spent most of the game powering Bowser.

[3:43:07] <%Asuterisuku> MKXL finally fixed up that port.
[3:43:07] <heartlesshealer> For Sunshine, remember water spraying feels different if you're not playing the gamecube version
[3:43:12] <%ggbhtg> There's a Batman game or 3 that was NOTORIOUSLY fucked, I think
[3:43:27] <%Javaa01> @EdenOfLove MKX was fucked for the better part of a year on PC, it was terrible before XL came out and fixed it
