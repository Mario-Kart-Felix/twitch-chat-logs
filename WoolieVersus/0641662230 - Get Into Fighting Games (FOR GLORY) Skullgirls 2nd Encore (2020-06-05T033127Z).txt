[0:24:31] <DingasKhan> THE FOX
[0:24:32] <$QueequegTheater> Wait why would I set a team when I can't have 3 Valentines stepping on me
[0:24:33] <+jiggy_snipe> Fanatical.com
[0:24:43] <+Ancopro> know your rights
[0:24:44] <Andrizzleton> Who is Sonic Fox even? Just some lucky guy?
[0:24:55] <dinnydanny777> How do you know if your opponent has a Turbo controller
[0:25:03] <+YabbaTroll> controversial furry fight gamer
[0:25:06] <TheFramedWarlock> Sonic Fox is one of the best fighting game players right now
[0:25:09] <%Noponiz> is this game even playable without assist macros unless you solo, lets be real
[0:25:11] <TheVoltStrike> no he's not just a lucky guy
[0:25:19] <TheFramedWarlock> Something around 98 tournament wins ?
[0:25:25] <%ChoculaUltra> he's the Frieza to GO1's Goku.
[0:25:28] <TheFramedWarlock> Across like 5 games
[0:25:28] <+LastHazzerd> some lucky fox person who lucked their way to being one of the best in the fight game scene, a scene based on luck
[0:25:31] <TheVoltStrike> i may not know much about him, but i know that much, he's good
[0:25:38] <%optimasmaximas> what's a macro input?
[0:26:06] <$QueequegTheater> @TheVoltStrike Whoops, I was thinking of the Raven skin
[0:26:12] <%Noponiz> it means you map multiple things to 1 button like mp and hk @optimasmaximas
[0:26:13] <%ChoculaUltra> I read once that Sonicfox keeps frame data in the furry suit helmet he wears occasionally.
[0:26:18] <rcand9> EDUCATION
[0:26:22] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:26:40] <%Noponiz> so usually you need 2 buttons for an assist, but with macro you can basically set a dedicated button for assists
[0:26:41] <%gatorafan> The fact no other tag game uses custom assist after Skullgirls upsets me. Everyone should be stealing that.
[0:26:48] <TheVoltStrike> that Raven color is pretty good tho
[0:26:49] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @Wool "I don't play this game"
[0:26:50] <Davybot> brazilian bella fuck yeah
[0:26:53] <+saltpiggu> @optimasmaximas its when a button is programmed to emulate multiple other button presses
[0:26:53] <%tearfuldevil> SonicFox is one of the world best fighting game players, scoring regular wins in the tournament scenes of multiple games. They're "contreversial" for being a black gay furry who goes by they/them, and also for liking porn or something?
[0:26:55] <%optimasmaximas> @Noponiz oh so you could just choose 1 button for a game that has more than 4 attack buttons?
[0:26:55] <%Noponiz> tbf custom assists are hard as fuck to balance
[0:27:04] <%optimasmaximas> @saltpiggu oh ok
[0:27:07] <GrandmasterBFunk> Kirby double
[0:27:09] <+beegduck> doublicious
[0:27:12] <%optimasmaximas> @Noponiz @saltpiggu thanks
[0:27:16] <raikagelord1> So since Skull girls is now published by Skybound Entertainment, I would like to also shout out a Comic the Creator Robert Kirkman made Called “Invincible”. I so want it to be a Game as well.
[0:27:19] <+jiggy_snipe> bubble gum Kappa
[0:27:19] <$QueequegTheater> @TheVoltStrike Oh yeah. I wish I was even a little bit decent with anything but Valentine (and I'm not even all that good at her)
[0:27:22] <+flootersam> DO THE TAUNT ASSIST
[0:27:39] <%Noponiz> the game has a small roster so that helps keeps things sane despite custom assists
[0:27:40] <+LeaIsChill> I would play the fuck out of this game on Switch tbh
[0:27:42] <+LeaIsChill> I ought pick it up
[0:27:43] <dinnydanny777> I have Twitch's filtering on and some of these comments look really funny with all the asterisks
[0:27:50] <%Noponiz> that said, they still should do custom assists in other games, because fuck it
[0:28:03] <$QueequegTheater> nfuckg
[0:28:04] <TheFramedWarlock> @leaischill Barely anyone plays it on Switch, you're better off buying it on Steam
[0:28:12] <TheFramedWarlock> That's where the community is most active
[0:28:19] <%ChoculaUltra> I didn't know you had to pay to upgrade to 2nd Encore. Curse my brokeness! FeelsBadMan
[0:28:27] <TheVoltStrike> @QueequegTheater ah dude it's alright, i never played online, just using squigly against the cpu for years, i'm probably worse than you
[0:28:34] <+flootersam> You can still play without second encore
[0:28:37] <%optimasmaximas> big band time
[0:28:38] <TheFramedWarlock> Second encore is 2$ on Fanatical atm Chocula
[0:28:40] <+flootersam> Only skins mostly
[0:28:41] <%ChoculaUltra> OH MAN
[0:28:43] <%ChoculaUltra> GET READY

[1:05:42] <+jiggy_snipe> oh ok
[1:05:42] <+DinnerCalzone> wait why is sonicfox floating an inch off the ground
[1:05:43] <HolisticField> is valentine just out of meta or what?
[1:05:56] <$QueequegTheater> @DinnerCalzone It's one of his furry powers
[1:06:00] <$QueequegTheater> *thier
[1:06:02] <HolisticField> @DinnerCalzone theyve got gamer magic
[1:06:04] <$QueequegTheater> *their
[1:06:09] <theSLiKbandit> I dunno, I guess it's just a slight oversight by the devs
[1:06:19] <Iam_Dead> nah, Valentine is good. Just not a ton of players play her
[1:06:19] <+flootersam> Furry powers
[1:06:24] <%ChoculaUltra> how different is Robo-Fortune from Ms. Fortune?
[1:06:26] <+TheOneCalledRock> i think it might be an oversight
[1:06:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I see it a lot with squiggly's chord, f
[1:06:36] <+jiggy_snipe> interesting
[1:06:37] <+TheOneCalledRock> @ChoculaUltra a lot
[1:06:37] <+UnderseaMagic> robo is totally different
[1:06:39] <rcand9> i did
[1:06:41] <+LastHazzerd> i saw it
[1:06:41] <%floralkami> @dinnercalzone I think their character is some kind of ethereal being. their characters float in their stream layout too
[1:06:42] <%Camail> it replaces the hit spark
[1:06:44] <alephalpha> love how sol's fire seal just pops out sometimes
[1:06:46] <SoromopsEX> Ms Fortune is getting in, Robo Fortune is getting out
[1:06:47] <%ChoculaUltra> oooo I'm intrigued.
[1:06:48] <artificiallynatural> @ChoculaUltra very different. Ms fortune is a puppet rushdown character, robo is more of a zoner
[1:06:49] <Viewtiful_Rose> Robo and ms are completely different
[1:07:10] <+LastHazzerd> a fighting game made by fighting game fans
[1:07:15] <OkamiDude15> is there any reason for me to get the second encore dlc if i already have all the characters?
[1:07:20] <artificiallynatural> well maybe not rushdown but she's much more in your face
[1:07:39] <HolisticField> @OkamiDude15 its a shitty deal if you already have them
[1:07:47] <OkamiDude15> gotcha
[1:07:51] <+flootersam> a
[1:07:55] <%floralkami> @okamidude15 pretty sure Second Encore has 2-3 other characters, RoboFortune and Squiggly
[1:08:00] <bevyrage> i'd say robo is better for building meter while fortune is rushdown
[1:08:12] <%chase959> what is that fox dude in the back
[1:08:14] <Iam_Dead> @okamidude15 there's some trials and some modes (and I think voiced single player) but otherwise you're good.
[1:08:16] <$QueequegTheater> Okay but what if they block all your moves and then ToD you
[1:08:19] <%chase959> why is that fox dude in the back
[1:08:21] <theSLiKbandit> that's SonicFox's OC
[1:08:24] <%chase959> ohh
[1:08:25] <OkamiDude15> kk
[1:08:28] <+UnderseaMagic> robo also has the godly h. beam assist
[1:08:33] <theSLiKbandit> got added in some time ago

[1:08:45] <@Solidus_113> There's the yellow flash for armour
[1:08:46] <%fizzguy47> @queequegtheater Then you shouldn't have even tried
[1:08:54] <$QueequegTheater> @fizzguy47 :(
[1:08:59] <%chase959> glad to know there was a reason for him
[1:09:05] <%floralkami> @okamidude15 there should also be some really good voice packs for multiple characters and the announcers that are worth the price imo, but hey
[1:09:15] <Iam_Dead> colors??? poor Minh T_T
[1:09:18] <+ikasukiz> sonicfox is known for his skullgirls play
[1:09:20] <Dumple_Roe> @okamidude15 it's add more color palettes from the beta and mobile
[1:09:23] <+ikasukiz> their
[1:09:24] <+Hilleltaco> @floralkami Squigly and Robo Fortune aren't from second encore, they're just included in it. The voice packs are also in the base game
[1:09:25] <+ikasukiz> shit
[1:09:30] <rcand9> smart
[1:09:39] <+Hilleltaco> Voice acting for story however, is a second encore thing
[1:09:46] <OkamiDude15> was gonna get it from fanatical but it looks like its already sold out doodLUL

[1:21:33] <+ggbhtg> @pkmamsters She an FGC mom
[1:21:34] <Glassbrain> @Solidus_113 a peacock taunt ensures the next level 3 item drop is a Tenrai Ha, not increases chances of road roller

[1:25:22] <imnoobpepesad> except her ender @artificiallynatural
[1:25:30] <%jubejube56> H item is the homing on right?
[1:26:00] <%crimsonsaens> The constant restarts really suck too
[1:26:05] <+saltpiggu> @crimsonsaens her 2nd combo trial is literally two combo input rows off from her proper one and the trial is easier\
[1:26:14] <@Solidus_113> H is only homing from a specific range
[1:26:26] <%jubejube56> Ahhhh okay
[1:26:28] <@Solidus_113> it won't get as close as the L Item
[1:26:33] <%jubejube56> Neat

[1:27:39] <raikagelord1> Doesn’t his chair have a name. LUL LUL LUL
[1:27:42] <artificiallynatural> beowulf is the best fighting game character ever designed
[1:27:47] <+FedoraNinja> undizzy: Mike's answer to 2 min long TODs
[1:27:55] <alephalpha> every starter for every stage cannot be reused
[1:27:56] <+jiggy_snipe> too close to IBS Kappa
[1:28:10] <%jubejube56> I will take a mix over a long TOD anyday
[1:28:15] <alephalpha> crouch and standing buttons are shared
[1:28:17] <dinnydanny777> Dumping in the air with IBS
[1:28:35] <%emperordread> TODs put me off of so many fighting games, this IPS sounds great
[1:28:36] <raikagelord1> @artificiallynatural I’m pretty sure they based a lot of FighterZ characters after him because they oddly have some of the same moves.( mainly DBS Broly)
[1:28:41] <Greedboyz> And we're back
[1:29:20] <+Joestar_SSB> Eyyy haven’t seen SonicFox yet, he looks cool : D
[1:29:22] <alephalpha> @emperordread you mean infinites ips doesn't technically stop tods though skullgirls isn't tod heavy you need about 6 hits to kill a team of any size
[1:29:27] <alephalpha> clean hits
[1:29:36] <%optimasmaximas> LUL

[1:29:40] <%crimsonsaens> @saltpiggu Cerebella's 2nd combo is literally 4 attacks, including a jump-in and super. It only demonstrates 5B staggers, and that's it
[1:29:43] <%emperordread> Ah, good to know. Thanks @alephalpha
[1:29:46] <+jiggy_snipe> just go green purple and orange
[1:29:50] <DRCrosston> Did I miss the part where we fight Woolie?
[1:29:52] <Cobalt_ex> always match your colors

[1:29:56] <+DinnerCalzone> CHUN LI DOG
[1:30:03] <%Zayasu> FrankerZ
[1:30:03] <ZeeJiggle> Aight but what if the colors don't match, but there's still a theme
[1:30:13] <%optimasmaximas> yeah
[1:30:14] <Cobalt_ex> that is also good
[1:30:14] <Mach5Mike> Charge character dogs doodbenny
[1:30:17] <Thunderhog> Just as an actual question, I recall IPS triggers when you start with button you've already done in a combo specifcly
[1:30:20] <%optimasmaximas> like what if they have all jojo skins
[1:30:34] <%optimasmaximas> big band jotaro and dio eliza
[1:30:43] <+ItsRatman> Is that Chun Li as a dog?
[1:30:43] <%LTKonnor> @optimasmaximas at that point, you just bend over and prepare yourself
[1:30:49] <GrinningOni> matching colors is a statement that you think you're good???

[1:30:55] <Thunderhog> Like you can use j.HP in the air multiple times so long as you dont start the combo with j.HP
[1:30:58] <dinnydanny777> This game has got nothing on Shrek Super Slam
[1:31:01] <Kenny_Riot> @ItsRatman Chun dog and Guile dog
[1:31:11] <artificiallynatural> @Thunderhog yeah if the same buttons comes out too quickly in a loop, ips triggers
[1:31:18] <+ChrisPlaysThing> Smash player confirmed? Kappa
[1:31:28] <jsavarin> omg the streetfighter dogs
[1:31:28] <dinnydanny777> Shrek Super Slam is the best fighting game ever made
[1:31:54] <raikagelord1> @dinnydanny777 what about that Billy and Mandy Game? It was pretty good and like Shark Super slam.
[1:31:59] <Thunderhog> Im mostly saying cause as little as I know on skullgirls, looping with J.HP is squiggly's BnB
[1:32:01] <T_Sasquatch> girl
[1:32:07] <Thunderhog> you just start with different air starters
[1:32:33] <alephalpha> doesn't really matter for eliza cause you generally have one air route to a a restand

[1:32:42] <haViciX> undizzy is like reverse stunned
[1:32:42] <%scrublord009> Still not clear
[1:32:45] <%LTKonnor> @dinnydanny777 nah the best fighting game is Dark Souls 2 Kappa
[1:32:47] <Rhinoprotoss> Light skinned Eliza is a crime
[1:32:52] <+MrBotchamania> Blocking the burst means you cannot punish it.
[1:32:53] <alephalpha> @scrublord009 what specifcally?
[1:32:59] <+saltpiggu> @crimsonsaensmy bad i meant third trail
[1:33:02] <TheFramedWarlock> Undizzy is basically you building burst meter for the enemy the more you repeat your attacks
[1:33:06] <+saltpiggu> Trial
[1:33:06] <alephalpha> not play i-no eliza is a crime
[1:33:23] <+ManOfReason> oh its a reverse stun
[1:33:23] <dinnydanny777> Woolie didn't touch the ground for like 10 seconds
[1:33:35] <%jubejube56> Not even with repeating attacks, it builds up when you enter certain stages of a combo
[1:33:39] <%jubejube56> Like entering a juggle
[1:33:41] <+saltpiggu> @crimsonsaens my bad I meant third trial
[1:34:09] <GrandmasterBFunk> So resets don't get rid of undizzy
[1:34:09] <Thunderhog> It's reverse Street fighter stun
[1:34:14] <Thunderhog> hense undizzy
[1:34:35] <CalderGaming> and/or the KI combo meter going over 100, right?
[1:34:40] <alephalpha> undizzy is just hits there's a seprate system where if you repeat the smae button as a starter for a stage they will burst pout
[1:34:42] <T_Sasquatch> sfv dizzy mechanic is so dumb holy shit
[1:35:20] <+PlushMines> God the animation of this game never ceases to amaze me
[1:35:25] <@Solidus_113> CRISP
[1:35:37] <%crimsonsaens> @saltpiggu 3 is okay, but at that point you might as well just learn the better enders.
[1:35:43] <alephalpha> dizzy in games genreally changes risk ater certain hits and allows for more dynamic decision making when you predict how the information of potential dizzy's chnage how th eopponent reacts it's not completely worthless
[1:35:56] <@Solidus_113> dash it?
[1:36:01] <%Noponiz> i dont think you need to walk forward
[1:36:13] <OkamiDude15> dash has start up
[1:36:31] <%crimsonsaens> Dizzy is only a worthwhile mechanic when a player can choose between going for dizzy or damage in their options, most games didn't have that option
[1:36:32] <alephalpha> eliza has a massiVE GRAB RANGE
[1:36:38] <@Menitta> you can combo out of grabs right?

[1:46:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> I like playing R. Fortune and Valentine
[1:46:22] <alephalpha> yeah generally th only reason to play solo is if you're new and are learning, though there have been solos in top 8s

[1:47:01] <alephalpha> duo is once again less flexible then trio but if you have a strong synergy and gameplan between two character the ability to use those 2 more might be worth it for you as a player
[1:47:13] <HolisticField> valentine is great with assists backing her up
[1:47:19] <DSD24> This Eliza color looks familiar
[1:47:25] <Kenny_Riot> Real talk, I saw that Body Bag Izuna Drop and it was a wrap. I was a stan from the jump.
[1:47:26] <alephalpha> trio obviously has two assists so eyah

[2:03:30] <+ShazBo2000> Yamane-san on the board, get yo’ ‘Vania fix
[2:03:38] <kayagroove> @legacy0117 you mean his j hk?
[2:03:43] <imnoobpepesad> this game is riperrino after evo and everything goes back to normal LUL
[2:03:46] <@Solidus_113> the taunted version of that is really good too
[2:03:47] <Kenny_Riot> @ReDexuz Skullgirls is the DNB of fighting games. It may not have the spotlight, but it will always live and always be good.
[2:03:49] <+ShazBo2000> Hot and balanced out the gate, fuck yo’ HD mix
[2:03:55] <castle_ssbu> I love you WOOLIE, never stop streaming
[2:04:02] <alephalpha> @imnoobpepesad the real issue with charge charcter is you need a mental timer for how long your charge needs to be and charging whil doing normal for combos then there's charge partioning where you can quickly go back to the direction and keep you charge
[2:04:04] <+ShazBo2000> You want them aerial raves, but you want them with chicks?
[2:04:13] <alephalpha> basically it's a different mindset that needs to be trained
[2:04:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Kenny_Riot Meltyblood
[2:04:17] <+ShazBo2000> Three on three with the ladies, a menage-a-six?
[2:04:21] <Karhax> charge is only 0.5 seconds in this game though
[2:04:35] <+ShazBo2000> Dat free ratio booty, custom assists
[2:04:49] <Kenny_Riot> @doc_ock_rokc Melty Blood is anime Punk Rock. Played best in Dive spots
[2:04:50] <imnoobpepesad> @alephalpha oh yeah I forgot about charge partitioning, ugh it makes me not even want to try lol
[2:04:56] <+ShazBo2000> Too much animation, butt be shittin’ bricks
[2:05:03] <alephalpha> tbf most game you never eally need it
[2:05:21] <imnoobpepesad> 5Head = mikeZ
[2:05:22] <%SnackinOnChimps> whos ther rest of the team?
[2:05:22] <+ShazBo2000> Need dat Mahvel hype, but without all the dicks???
[2:05:25] <alephalpha> @imnoobpepesad what games do you play?
[2:05:29] <+ShazBo2000> SKULLGIRLZ
[2:05:46] <imnoobpepesad> @alephalpha just skullgirls, im new to fg :)

[2:06:09] <%jubejube56> scrubify*
[2:06:20] <Kenny_Riot> @SnackinOnChimps Woolie's team? or Sharpie's?
[2:06:35] <alephalpha> @imnoobpepesad I only really tried to properly elarna fightoing game a couple months ago and what seems like insurmountable walls fall away way faster then you would expect or feel they woul at the beginning
[2:07:17] <%SnackinOnChimps> @Kenny_Riot Der Wooldog, dono who Sharpie is
[2:07:17] <T_Sasquatch> Tight timing, yall should try playing erron black in mk11 LUL
[2:07:25] <alephalpha> @parasoul isn't that bad you just need to get used toholding direction before using charge moves in combos
[2:07:34] <imnoobpepesad> @alephalpha winning at solo queue feels like an impossible wall LUL but I know what you mean, I can see my progress when practicing bnb :)
[2:07:40] <alephalpha> also you can measure your charges with ho her walk animation
[2:08:01] <alephalpha> and slowly you'll get used to the timing
[2:08:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:08:26] <alephalpha> @imnoobpepesad it happens I just lost like 50 matches to pepperslash in guilty gear a couple of weeks ago
[2:08:29] <Kenny_Riot> @SnackinOnChimps Big Band, Peacock, Beowolf
[2:08:50] <+CatPle> Launcher jMP jHP jHK is easier
[2:09:02] <%SnackinOnChimps> @Kenny_Riot Thanks bud!
[2:09:16] <Iam_Dead> parasoul is great for learning charge, a lot of her moves are designed for you to charge immediately after use.
[2:09:16] <+mans51> can't hear the audio.. anyone else got this problem?
[2:09:19] <imnoobpepesad> LUL
[2:09:22] <Kenny_Riot> @SnackinOnChimps Sharpie usually uses Solo Eliza, but in this, she's got Eliza, Miss Fortune, and Fillia

[2:10:03] <%crimsonsaens> I never noticed the floor pulse colors
[2:10:11] <alephalpha> @imnoobpepesad winning is definitely fun but try to take small victories at first just properly applying concepts and fucking them up a lot of people have been playing for a while also there are a lot of new players coming in it's a good time to try. You can also join the discord so you can get help when you need it. Also don't spend too much time in training mode it should be used when you need to discovers answer to how to counter something that's been fucking you up.
[2:10:15] <Chaohord> @mans51 Problem's on your end
[2:10:30] <Kenny_Riot> @crimsonsaens It's a new thing. I didn't know about them until Sharpie pointed them out in a recent video

[2:13:23] <alephalpha> @imnoobpepesad there's definitelya point where people traing mode thmsleve sout early if it's too hard try practising the hard bnb for a bit before jumping online and actuially playing try finding an easy combo that you can get a knowckdown and some sort of oki afterwards. getting some basic mixup ideas and oki wilh a bais ass combo still better then a combo you can't do yet
[2:13:46] <+SvenHolgersson> DAYUMMMMMMMM
[2:13:48] <alephalpha> plus its stilla game it should be fun
[2:14:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Dak3000 I don't know it was running wild
[2:14:22] <imnoobpepesad> @alephalpha that sounds better, I guess I can edit the combo and just end with a knowdown

[2:31:01] <alephalpha> @doc_ock_rokc I'm obviously no expert at skullgirls but from what I rember as of recently she wasn't considered that good I mean ti seems like the tiers are pretty close together and everyone is viable at this point but yeah
[2:31:03] <imnoobpepesad> just do your next character super after your super
[2:31:13] <gorillahandz> GIGANTIC ARRRM!
[2:31:23] <Kenny_Riot> @StrawberryPantsu It comes from Marvel vs. Capcom 2
[2:31:37] <+FedoraNinja> EVERY char has a punish for air wulf. Some just have a shitty punish
[2:31:46] <+StrawberryPantsu> Ye but whats the input @Kenny_Riot

[2:34:54] <alephalpha> and pretty much all of eliza buttons hurtboxes come out before the hitboxes
[2:34:59] <%laserbeaming> did they explain the shorthop yet?
[2:34:59] <alephalpha> so it just murders her
[2:35:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> Peaowolf doesn't sound good ether
[2:35:02] <gorillahandz> my friend who plays wulf abuses J.HP and I hate it
[2:35:13] <imnoobpepesad> shorthop is just dash, right?
[2:35:14] <+StrawberryPantsu> Fuck that move and fuck Tickelmyhams

[2:35:26] <gorillahandz> IT'S SO MEAN
[2:35:27] <%laserbeaming> yeah, his dash is a short hop
[2:35:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> @gorillahandz Its one of his best approches
[2:35:31] <exploitativity2> THE BEST CROSSUP
[2:35:32] <$Invlux> DIRTY

[2:35:47] <%RiceeFTW> build HYPE
[2:35:51] <%crimsonsaens> Is every non-Eliza Sharpie's least favorite character?
[2:36:01] <@Solidus_113> Don't assume Woolie will be able to do this in the moment
[2:36:04] <skewerstar> It's basically a Gief Splash!
[2:36:06] <alephalpha> eliza's currently the worst character so maybe?
[2:36:20] <gorillahandz> no i expect woolie to be on sonicfox's level by the end of this stream
[2:36:20] <critfumble_> how the hell do I choose between Eliza bigband beowolf carabella
[2:36:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:36:21] <%crimsonsaens> Don't worry, Woolie will forget everything in an hour
[2:36:25] <critfumble_> and the list goes on
[2:36:27] <imnoobpepesad> SNAP THE SPOOKY
[2:36:29] <+Ancopro> im excited to see more raw supers/tags sdespite all this

[2:36:59] <Solidnick18> woahhh
[2:37:04] <alephalpha> solos can heal by snappoing
[2:37:04] <lennyrager> No just grapplers and fukua
[2:37:09] <GenoCL> Yoooo skullgirls
[2:37:14] <alephalpha> and you can remove their health by snapping them
[2:37:19] <GenoCL> all the Marvel hype but without all the dicks
[2:37:34] <gorillahandz> there's some cock bro dont worry
[2:37:43] <TheVoltStrike> there's always dick
[2:37:44] <gorillahandz> peacock, that is
[2:37:48] <TheVoltStrike> o
[2:37:51] <alephalpha> band probbaly no longer has a dick
[2:38:01] <+Jaysky> Hey guys we at EVO already?
[2:38:02] <+ThePayphone> ngl she better in skeleton form
[2:38:07] <+Namboto> there's a bike horn where his dick was

[2:38:23] <animailistic> bro hithg tier marvel barely has dicks
[2:38:26] <alephalpha> beowulf pretty hot
[2:38:30] <gorillahandz> double cock
[2:38:41] <DusK_The_Stray> Damn, I didn't know snapping a solo removed red health and I've had the game since release.
[2:38:47] <animailistic> marvel 2 you got magnet man and cable and like thats it
[2:38:51] <+SvenHolgersson> Thank god the guy who gets The Baz recolor makes the enemy ragequit lol
[2:39:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Beo band is evil
[2:39:06] <%laserbeaming> s.HK is your only heavy that doesn't change without your chair
[2:39:11] <Zaku_III> I thought that was The Baz for a second
[2:39:14] <%laserbeaming> and it's good
[2:39:20] <gorillahandz> it is his colors
[2:39:24] <%RiceeFTW> it's a baz colorway
[2:39:35] <%jubejube56> Snapping with the beo throw also gives you an incoming mixup vs a solo, only method to do so
[2:39:38] <Zaku_III> Glorious.

[2:41:05] <alephalpha> woolie sings toward sbig band

[2:43:14] <BwdYeti> PogChamp
[2:43:18] <alephalpha> @gorillahandz that's fair what I've seen doesn't have but things can change but if it's not for me it's not for me I'll just play a game I like
[2:43:22] <+ReaperOf1st> People calling easy execution fighters for babies. might be the no skill babies themselves.
[2:43:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[2:43:24] <gorillahandz> look if they reveal baiken im playing strive regardless
[2:43:35] <%RiceeFTW> @ReaperOf1st those are the kids that get shmixerized
[2:43:38] <lennyrager> Any team size is viable
[2:43:44] <RoxMoxie> You know what I mean? Drop your shield.
[2:43:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> Beo was created as anti Eliza
[2:43:46] <alephalpha> @gorillahandz also who knows myabe I'll go back to +r if +r rollback communit edition happens
[2:43:48] <+ReaperOf1st> oh yeah
[2:43:50] <imnoobpepesad> match ups Poggers
[2:43:54] <%Jack8274> Arm-ored
[2:43:57] <%Jack8274> LUL
[2:43:58] <gorillahandz> @alephalpha yeah i get you strive's been looking weird but since it's still a year out you never know
[2:43:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kinda like Band was created as anti Peacock
[2:44:03] <spooksy> crouching hk is also nutty
[2:44:12] <%RiceeFTW> just block the shmix dekillRobo
[2:44:14] <+UberWolfman> The lack of any interesting charaters is more of a damper for me imo.
[2:44:19] <BootyZipperooni> the arm is NOT disjointed btw
[2:44:22] <gorillahandz> oh man rollback for AC+R would be greaat
[2:44:30] <imnoobpepesad> BAIKEN? max bros lets gooo!
[2:44:33] <alephalpha> @gorillahandz any prediction on the character in two weeks?
[2:44:49] <+CatPle> You have sHP cHP H hurl
[2:44:53] <+ReaperOf1st> Got to admit,after playing air dashers for a few years. I think I'm good on remembering long strings, strong footsies and higher damage feels really nice.
[2:44:57] <alephalpha> @gorillahandz it being actively worke don right now still far out frombeing real thouh
[2:44:59] <gorillahandz> @alephalpha maybe testament and baiken? it'd be cool to get the full OG cast
[2:44:59] <+CatPle> H hurl is his dp and it’s also+ on block lol
[2:45:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Intresting my playstyle is all about switching between the chair and fist as much as possible
[2:45:08] <critiquequartz> Chat when are we getting another skullgirls?
[2:45:13] <gorillahandz> minus the old guy for plot reasons
[2:45:27] <T_Sasquatch> @critiquequartz hahahahahahahaha
[2:45:28] <+ReaperOf1st> Plus, my friends aren't as intimated when they see you don't need a 40+ hit combo to be considered decent.
[2:45:30] <%Kurt_0> Ohh
[2:45:34] <alephalpha> they have plot way to bring back justice now so that's a maybe
[2:45:39] <%RiceeFTW> if skullgirls is so good why is there no skullgirls 2? dekillBruh
[2:45:45] <BootyZipperooni> it's for his bnb!
[2:45:47] <imnoobpepesad> just port skullgirls mobile Kappa

[2:45:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @RiceeFTW Encore is 2
[2:46:00] <spooksy> light chair is good in blockstrings
[2:46:08] <%RiceeFTW> 2nd encore for $2 dekillAbella pick this game up folks
[2:46:11] <+Promessa_EX> skullgirls 2 should actually be called deadly airport
[2:46:11] <gorillahandz> @alephalpha yo one of my hopes is for Aria to be playable but she's a wack-ass Jack-O/Justice hybrid
[2:46:15] <BootyZipperooni> @WoolieVersus L Chair toss is safe, hits low, breaks armor, and leads into one of his most damaging combos
[2:46:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> Skullgirls 2 comes out when KOF XV comes out BibleThump
[2:46:17] <+Jaysky> Because it's still in it's launch party @RiceeFTW
[2:46:20] <+UberWolfman> We need to go bigger with 3rd Encore chat Kappa
[2:46:22] <Iam_Dead> you absolute baffoon. you've never heard of deadly airport?
[2:46:49] <alephalpha> @gorillahandz she's jacko but she has an install super that maker her original justice or install supered justice from +r
[2:46:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> Its isn't suicide
[2:46:53] <imnoobpepesad> when are they adding filia with a gun?
[2:46:57] <+skylerpilot> in combo you can to light chair, dash forward into j.MP, s..HK into stagger restand then any combo you want

[2:55:30] <raikagelord1> I believe it has set it’s own precedent
[2:55:30] <%LabZero> Yep, Beo has a few that you can do the same thing and combo or be safe.
[2:55:34] <extradopeness> I get wrecked by trios in QM all the time Online, but i have taken sets from people who switch to solos (i only play fukua)

[2:57:05] <+BubbaRands> GGPO:GO
[2:57:08] <%LabZero> @scrublord009 do what? If you're on PC, buy the "2nd Encore" upgrade DLC. On console..you wait for us to finish that patch. :^P
[2:57:16] <+ion666> whoah write that down for me lol
[2:57:19] <CloudCircus> Can developers participate in Evo for their game?
[2:57:20] <imnoobpepesad> meanwhile CAPCOM releases another DLC Kappa
[2:57:24] <gorillahandz> New character is Mobile only but I believe they say if the support is there they'll bring them to the main game
[2:57:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:57:25] <%scrublord009> @LabZero How do I play the game good? Kappa

[2:57:35] <%LabZero> @scrublord009 solo Band

[2:57:45] <Rhinoprotoss> I thought the Blitzer combo is easier
[2:57:46] <+hunter_half_hands> is that crank???
[2:57:53] <Iam_Dead> he's not wrong
[2:57:55] <%DaPurpleSharpie> yes @HunterBR549
[2:57:59] <imnoobpepesad> solo band does no damage tho Kappa

[2:58:55] <imnoobpepesad> hello can i sing up for be gr8 through this chat? Kappa
[2:59:03] <%RiceeFTW> dekillBand
[2:59:03] <Kenny_Riot> @CommanderSqueaks Guess so, considering I've never heard of Arch Linux
[2:59:04] <roboguy2k> Really happy to see Skullgirls relevant again, shame what they did to the training stage though
[2:59:14] <DarkVinceX> shame?
[2:59:18] <%DaPurpleSharpie> mods pls time out @RiceeFTW for 1 second
[2:59:21] <gorillahandz> dont be like that
[2:59:25] <alephalpha> shame?
[2:59:26] <%RiceeFTW> dekillTears
[2:59:27] <Nekros4442> The real question is when's Minette?
[2:59:45] <imnoobpepesad> no grapplers in this chat!! DansGame
[2:59:46] <critfumble_> this is a sonicfox respect zone, get that shit outta here
[2:59:51] <alephalpha> is it this shit with chuds being assholes about sonicfox again?
[2:59:56] <+h3b3r_98> atpBigot
[2:59:57] <%crimsonsaens> @scrublord009 It's just about the timing. You can delay the time between the two aerials to make it more consistent
[3:00:05] <DedlokPM> @roboguy2k Yes. Shame that they improved the training stage. I am sure @LabZero would agree with that
[3:00:11] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:00:13] <+SvenHolgersson> LUL
[3:00:14] <gorillahandz> the fucking walk of shame back to his chair

[3:00:24] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:00:24] <%jubejube56> Nothing makes me happy quite like using almost every cerebella command grab in my combo
[3:00:26] <Iam_Dead> LUL
[3:00:27] <Clawmaster_> lol
[3:00:29] <imnoobpepesad> the new character is a GRAPPLER?? PogChamp
[3:00:31] <Clawmaster_> hell no
[3:00:35] <exploitativity2> 5 bar chair magnet
[3:00:35] <Iam_Dead> no
[3:00:38] <exploitativity2> some thor shit
[3:00:40] <gorillahandz> what a dumb level 5 i love it
[3:00:41] <alephalpha> remember old chair and old ship @DaPurpleSharpie
[3:00:43] <@Solidus_113> No, you have to make it a taunt-set lvl3
[3:00:44] <exploitativity2> let it return to my hand!
[3:00:47] <rat__baby> nah let beo teleport to his chair instead
[3:00:49] <%Jack8274> So brutal LUL
[3:00:51] <+SammyOVision> It's not teleporting, clearly a crowd member is throwing a spare into the ring
[3:00:54] <lucario12345> Let's not get crazy here!!!
[3:00:57] <exploitativity2> STOP THE CHAIRS
[3:00:58] <Rhinoprotoss> level 5 summon chairs please
[3:00:58] <RoxMoxie> Yo, hold up. The idea of him just holding his hand out and it comes back with a hitbox like Thor is dope tho
[3:01:00] <%Jack8274> Why don't you try... get goud?
[3:01:16] <Greedboyz> This stream is the skullgirls launch party STILL ONGOING
[3:01:18] <gorillahandz> The Hurting is BASICALLY Mjolnir
[3:01:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> @rat__baby There is only one gram
[3:01:26] <%DaPurpleSharpie> @rat__baby pls
[3:01:26] <BootyZipperooni> he should use all of his meter and all of his hype
[3:01:29] <alephalpha> @RoxMoxie the crowd just throwing him anothe rone would be good too
[3:01:30] <%DaPurpleSharpie> also hi @rat__baby
[3:01:31] <gorillahandz> the launch party never ends, it only gets louder
[3:01:33] <Iam_Dead> it's cool, but he DEF doesn't need it.
[3:01:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @kenny_riot If Ubuntu and Debian is computer without training wheels, Arch is computer is a unicycle without a seat.
[3:01:39] <%LabZero> @roboguy2k You can always pick the old version, but that's not good enough for some people. :^P
[3:01:46] <%jubejube56> The crowd in the desert
[3:01:50] <%jubejube56> With all the spare chairs
[3:01:52] <extradopeness> Launch Party Never Ends PogChamp
[3:02:03] <imnoobpepesad> Kreygasm omg
[3:02:15] <Solidnick18> he's learning FeelsGoodMan
[3:02:16] <+SvenHolgersson> Woolie Will It Figure Out
[3:02:17] <@Solidus_113> I just noticed this is the new stage too
[3:02:19] <%Jack8274> Just like he treats all his woma....
[3:02:19] <%crimsonsaens> Nice
[3:02:20] <@Solidus_113> damn
[3:02:22] <exploitativity2> yo mike we found an unpatched arcade cab in japan and my buddy just fukua jhk'd me for 30 minutes
[3:02:25] <%Jack8274> Kappa
[3:02:26] <RoxMoxie> That damage doesn't seem worth it for how difficult the combo was
[3:02:26] <%JaseAdrift> Nein
[3:02:26] <exploitativity2> it was really fun
[3:02:30] <%scrublord009> Man this WWE saudi contract is forever uh? Kappa
[3:02:35] <imnoobpepesad> cmonBruh
[3:02:41] <%LabZero> @exploitativity2 the arcade cabs are all unpatched :^(
[3:02:44] <%JaseAdrift> The Mighty Nein
[3:02:52] <gyabs> This stage gives me Metal Slug vibes.
[3:02:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> Eliza has more health since sharpie is playing solo
[3:03:00] <exploitativity2> suits me well enough, I can spam fukua jhk :^)
[3:03:01] <Thunderhog> @RoxMoxie The issue is damage scaling for teams. Sharpies a solo so she's got 3 players worth of health
[3:03:03] <fgiting> arcade fukua mshadow LUL
[3:03:03] <imnoobpepesad> this reset is wack, just block back Kappa
[3:03:08] <%crimsonsaens> @RoxMoxie This is against a solo, so most combos are only going to do about that much
[3:03:10] <+SvenHolgersson> That's my one and only combo
[3:03:14] <%optimasmaximas> so he's the blanka of this game got it
[3:03:15] <%Jack8274> LUL
[3:03:16] <alephalpha> IT'S JUST HAGGAR'S PIPE
[3:03:18] <BestTeaMaker> how viable is it to play this game as a solo character?
[3:03:19] <exploitativity2> LUL
[3:03:25] <chronoxgp> stab
[3:03:28] <jimmytwofeet> LUL
[3:03:29] <BestTeaMaker> like, are there any pros doing solos?
[3:03:30] <SoromopsEX> goddamnit I got exposed LUL
[3:03:31] <TheVoltStrike> what was fukua's M shadow? i forgot
[3:03:31] <RoxMoxie> @Thunderhog Yeah, I guess I also wasn't thinking about how you can use another super immediately after. Preferably one that can combo after.
[3:03:34] <%crimsonsaens> @BestTeaMaker Very, though some characters really want an assist
[3:03:35] <%Jack8274> HE HAS THE TOOLS, But does he have the skills LUL
[3:03:40] <raikagelord1> Doesn’t his Crouching Heavy grab?
[3:03:43] <Thunderhog> Solo can technically play just fine, but it's hard without assists for some characters
[3:03:44] <%Jack8274> I have a Hammer, I can't swing it
[3:03:46] <alephalpha> @BestTeaMaker well just saying two assist is very good
[3:03:48] <CorruptDropbear> OK, I can take off the training weights now
[3:04:01] <%jubejube56> @raikagelord1 I think that is crouching MP off otg?
[3:04:06] <RoxMoxie> Solo Big Band for LIFE
[3:04:07] <artificiallynatural> solo loses out on a lot but there are a number of solo players. Sonicfox always goes solo against solo players just because of the damage scaling
[3:04:13] <imnoobpepesad> we're winning evo now SwiftRage
[3:04:18] <raikagelord1> @jubejube56 yeah that is it.
[3:04:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ask now so you don't end up on @ScrubQuotes later.
[3:04:24] <gorillahandz> 1v1 skullgirls is fun
[3:04:29] <SoromopsEX> c.MK grabs after 236K i think
[3:04:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:04:33] <alephalpha> sharpie covering her bass with all the johns
[3:04:39] <%crimsonsaens> Her deal is infinite hyper armor on the skeleton attack
[3:04:41] <raikagelord1> @gorillahandz same
[3:04:46] <kayamek> @BestTeaMaker Yeah. Wing Zero Solo Filia is incredible but also there is good solo Valentine and Solo Peacocks around doing well
[3:04:48] <+hunter_half_hands> i sure wish there was a learning based stream i can be told what i can do better in sg skullg2Crank
[3:04:49] <JustKazura> Is this session getting uploaded to YouTube? I'm hella late.
[3:05:04] <extradopeness> Eliza and sekhmet go crazy
[3:05:07] <gorillahandz> you can probably just watch the vod
[3:05:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> OH! I thought that was her skeleton
[3:05:14] <SoromopsEX> Sack Mat
[3:05:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> everything goes on YouTube eventually
[3:05:20] <gorillahandz> It is her skelton
[3:05:21] <imnoobpepesad> that is a neeko skeleton AYAYA
[3:05:27] <gorillahandz> or rather, the skeleton is her
[3:05:34] <Manwad> touch the skeleton, do it now
[3:05:35] <exploitativity2> grab that skeleton
[3:05:36] <Thunderhog> Also Sechmet is technically armored
[3:05:43] <Thunderhog> If I recall
[3:05:48] <gorillahandz> Sekhmet is hyper-armored forever
[3:05:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Who else would totally watch a Skullgirls cartoon?
[3:05:52] <extradopeness> Killer Queen has no weaknesses
[3:06:00] <Iam_Dead> @woolieversus cr. mpx2 after grabs to convert

[3:06:42] <%crimsonsaens> @CommanderSqueaks crouching medium punch twice
[3:06:44] <%JaseAdrift> meant SICK
[3:06:45] <alephalpha> I wish I knew what to do on offense better
[3:06:45] <extradopeness> Hecky low

[3:07:01] <imnoobpepesad> where's ripple?
[3:07:03] <DedlokPM> @CommanderSqueaks crouch medium punch twice I think
[3:07:04] <Iam_Dead> you can do giant step instead but you lose sound stun.
[3:07:04] <gamecontroller25> who are we playing with
[3:07:15] <alephalpha> won a match armoring through robo's big laser super
[3:07:23] <BootyZipperooni> Doesn't Double have low snapback range?
