[0:11:58] <Aussie_Manny> iOS 14 was heating my phone up upon updating yesterday, so... thebkSip
[0:12:02] <dapperskeleton69> apple is the phone version of "oi ya got a loicense for that loicense?"
[0:12:32] <EternalJedi> apple phones aren't worth the cost for their specs, even not bleeding edge
[0:12:45] <+Superbro64> didn't apple kill all 32 bit applications and games?
[0:12:49] <%emperordread> everything apple is absolute garbage
[0:12:52] <%Javaa01> Everything you do on an Apple device is done on Apple's terms, and they are not afraid to screw you if you try to act smart
[0:13:08] <heartlesshealer> I don't know, but at least they failed in killing all Unreal Engine games
[0:13:15] <%Wool> rip phone
[0:13:24] <dapperskeleton69> every time apple fans rejoice bc apple implemented the most basic of features from android, i chuckle
[0:13:45] <+Superbro64> I find it funny how Pat and Woolie's talks on Apple v. Epic was -completely- removed from their opinions on the IOS system itself
[0:13:57] <%Irridium> all the fucking rich kids at my school had the razr. I'm sure it was a good phone but I just can't separate the two at this point.

[0:25:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:26:06] <heartlesshealer> it's on Steam for sure, not sure what else
[0:26:23] <NiktenKing> Pretty sure everything current gen
[0:26:27] <+Pyroclase> It's really weird that the armor and designs are *less* detailed in the animated intro
[0:26:30] <%mitchteck> Also on game pass
[0:26:33] <Aussie_Manny> 1st run. GO!
[0:26:39] <NiktenKing> Its on Switch... so there's that
[0:26:40] <+tehbeardedbard> 420 viewer i get to quit twitch
[0:26:51] <LeeOhX> first run best run calling it now
[0:26:53] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp
[0:26:55] <OToole42> Very much like Octopath Traveller
[0:26:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> wow
[0:26:58] <+Fattness132> 3d pixel style. thats cool
[0:26:58] <Aussie_Manny> Ah, there's the dialogue.
[0:27:00] <%Solidnick18> yooooo
[0:27:02] <+pectusumbra> @Pyroclase it's common for animation to have less details to be easier to animate
[0:27:05] <LeeOhX> oh shit this is not whatt I expected
[0:27:10] <+Razputin217> Rougelike or rouge-lite?
[0:27:10] <%Akizea> ayyyy Davion is my name
[0:27:14] <%a_goth_pancake> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:27:14] <%Akizea> weird to see my name in games tbh
[0:27:20] <jorniev> oh this is the one with the corgi
[0:27:21] <Aussie_Manny> ZUB ZUB CRUD LUL
[0:27:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's VERY pretty. Octopath also did lighting on pixels and that looked great as well
[0:27:37] <artificerjoni> @heartlesshealer @niktenking Thanks, I'm a PC and Nintendo guy.
[0:27:54] <RaidenRising> your mc is smoll
[0:28:03] <%a_goth_pancake> this looks gorgeous
[0:28:10] <heartlesshealer> you're welcome
[0:28:20] <DukeMoose> maybe they have jetpacks
[0:28:44] <Make_me_mad> Check out the in-battle backgrounds in this game too. They're gorgeous and the perspective shifting on them as turns change is really cool.
[0:28:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> jetpacks might be worth it
[0:28:57] <heartlesshealer> I like how the overworld controls pop up at the bottom
[0:29:07] <%a_goth_pancake> zooooooom
[0:29:13] <DukeMoose> the wreckage is a new playground
[0:29:18] <Aussie_Manny> D:
[0:29:23] <Aussie_Manny> STONE COLD!
[0:29:50] <+Regigangster> :( Enemy has low self esteem
[0:29:55] <LeeOhX> yeha oka this is dope
[0:30:07] <Make_me_mad> This combat system is really rad.
[0:30:11] <Parapattern> What would Woolie betray humanity for sooner: a jet pack or an exo-suit?
[0:30:18] <RaidenRising> jetpack
[0:30:20] <+Razputin217> Grandia?
[0:30:21] <NiktenKing> I wish Golden Sun made a return with this kinda sprite work and lighting. Actually pretty much and GBA era RPG honestly
[0:30:21] <assfordayz> Jets
[0:30:26] <+Regigangster> These pixel graphics are a bigger flex than all of The Thousand Year Door
[0:30:29] <heartlesshealer> close to Grandia yeah
[0:30:32] <assfordayz> But what if a human gives him a jetpack?
[0:30:45] <Aussie_Manny> @NiktenKing Nintendo: "That's a good idea, so no."
[0:30:53] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months!
[0:31:41] <assfordayz> *Gets shoot on the face, dies*
[0:31:59] <Aussie_Manny> 1st run scuffed. gg. Kappa
[0:32:03] <assfordayz> "Ow! I should have used armor on my head too"
[0:32:05] <%a_goth_pancake> who the fuck at Nintendo thought it would be a good idea to push the artificial scarcity on Mario allstars?
[0:32:21] <lotharrio> Oh man, that's an easy way to crit.
[0:32:25] <+Ricochet_Frame> Bullets Per Minute is a pretty bad ass game! ive completed a run with each of the characters and it has a lotta promise overall. I'm hoping they release more content for it down the road.
[0:32:29] <NiktenKing> @aussie Nintendo doesn't own Camelot tho
[0:32:36] <+b_aleph> @a_goth_pancake Gene Parmesan
[0:32:49] <Aussie_Manny> Yes, but the Edge of Tomorrow armour is SICK. HahaThink
[0:32:50] <+RowenCleric> @a_goth_pancake my uncle who works at Nintendo... Im sorry Im so ashamed
[0:32:54] <heartlesshealer> Nocturne feelings
[0:32:55] <%Vigonept> don't let them have a turn
[0:32:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1305742410211876864?s=19
[0:33:01] <dapperskeleton69> yo this music sounds like a techno mix of doom e1m1
[0:33:17] <%a_goth_pancake> @rowencleric you should be, give him a swift kick in the nuts at the next family get together
[0:33:21] <Aussie_Manny> Armour break?
[0:33:28] <+gitgouda> do the magic trick where you turn your enemy into a corpse
[0:33:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> pogg
[0:33:39] <lotharrio> Doesn't that mean that speed is always the right path to take?
[0:33:45] <Aussie_Manny> Well, I'm kinda glad it's not Active Battle System. You can take your time.
[0:34:01] <artificerjoni> @dapperskeleton69 It kind of does. Huh. woolieSPICE woolieGASM
[0:34:15] <%KilljoyHexx> Ohh very othercide like
[0:34:21] <heartlesshealer> Each diamond on the timeline is 10 seconds
[0:34:36] <dapperskeleton69> @lotharrio looks like speed isnt always the answer
[0:34:50] <popcultureaficionado> this game is cool
[0:34:56] <Aussie_Manny> Into the next ROUND?
[0:35:12] <dapperskeleton69> yo is this game do combo then?
[0:35:14] <jorniev> BREAK
[0:35:15] <Aussie_Manny> Ohhh, I see.
[0:35:24] <+Regigangster> Wow literally beating somebody into next Tuesday
[0:35:26] <%Vigonept> oh no is delay gonna be strong as shit like in trails?
[0:35:26] <Aussie_Manny> Yeah, I think so Do combo.
[0:35:30] <KaiserMario> Hey does anyone here knows if the Roosteeth stream was archived? I checked it today but couldn't find it anywhere...
[0:35:44] <Aussie_Manny> Hew
[0:35:51] <%Vigonept> check the rooster terth website
[0:35:55] <EternalJedi> uhhhh
[0:35:59] <KaiserMario> I said I just did
[0:36:05] <+jiggy_snipe> might be ps2
[0:36:08] <EternalJedi> I don't think I've ever seen a "knock them down the timeline" system before
[0:36:25] <%cabooseteamkill> grandia was a bit similar
[0:36:27] <%KilljoyHexx> @EternalJedi othercide has it too
[0:36:31] <artificerjoni> Didn't RoosterTeeth start an Archive purge?
[0:36:31] <$SilverRoddo> Infinity train?
[0:36:35] <dapperskeleton69> @kaisermario might not be archived so they can upload to youtube or smthn, earn extra bucks off of the recording
[0:36:35] <jorniev> was smt like that?
[0:36:44] <Aussie_Manny> I think Child of Light did something similar, if you hit an enemy , their turn comes later? I forget thuogh.
[0:37:00] <OToole42> octopath too
[0:37:01] <iambqb> The only real complaint I've had from playing this game is how long a run can be before you fail and restart
[0:37:11] <%Posh_Cat> Posh_Cat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! ellaLOVE
[0:37:12] <Aussie_Manny> gg
[0:37:29] <KaiserMario> @dapperskeleton69 Ok, I'll check again later, Woolie mentioned he would receive a link from them, but I'm guessing he never did
[0:37:30] <heartlesshealer> SMT was like that since Nocturne, except it was earning extra half-turns/actions instead of fully delay on the timeline.
[0:37:34] <%Javaa01> Also, needing to think about actions multiple turn phases in advance is very Frozen Synapse, where each turn phase is 5 seconds in real time
[0:38:01] <%Javaa01> So moving across the map can take multiple turns
[0:38:33] <Aussie_Manny> Titan Hand 2 when?
[0:38:35] <lotharrio> Buried giant robot?
[0:38:45] <TBFeric> this overworlds cute af
[0:38:51] <%Solidnick18> huh
[0:38:52] <NiktenKing> Octopath Traveler had the whole leg debilitation debuff that made your enemy start only on the next turn, but was limited to a few debuff abilities on certain classes
[0:39:01] <Aussie_Manny> Oooh, it's Blaze from Starcraft! :O
[0:39:04] <%Solidnick18> firewulf
[0:39:14] <KaiserMario> @dapperskeleton69 What's 'smthn'?
[0:39:19] <%Solidnick18> that's a cool design
[0:39:20] <+Regigangster> 40k dreadnought?
[0:39:26] <Aussie_Manny> AAAH
[0:39:28] <+Pyroclase> That looks SO GOOOOD
[0:39:31] <Aussie_Manny> THIS RUN IS FUCKED D:
[0:40:11] <dapperskeleton69> @kaisermario something
[0:40:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:40:21] <Aussie_Manny> Grass, Fire, Water, Electric...
[0:40:21] <heartlesshealer> These are your elements
[0:40:40] <heartlesshealer> Attack types are under your Power names
[0:41:02] <Afterman_> blue is armor
[0:41:06] <reonome> shields
[0:41:13] <Make_me_mad> Yellow is armor. Blue is shields.
[0:41:18] <Make_me_mad> Pink is HP.
[0:41:20] <Afterman_> yea shields i mean
[0:41:30] <Aussie_Manny> Why isn't HP green? D:
[0:41:40] <Afterman_> pink is abetter color than gren
[0:41:41] <Afterman_> green
[0:41:49] <Aussie_Manny> not in this stream, heathen
[0:41:54] <Aussie_Manny> Kappa
[0:42:13] <reonome> SMIRK
[0:42:41] <%zero_jacks> smirking
[0:42:47] <BoneBagMel> why this game look so fucking good
[0:43:07] <Aussie_Manny> the sprite work is so fuckin' good
[0:43:16] <+Estuko> That's very similar to dissidia rules on that break mechanic, setting them back a turn on Break
[0:43:20] <Aussie_Manny> this'd be solid on the Switch
[0:43:23] <%Javaa01> 20 seconds is the pushback
[0:43:30] <Aussie_Manny> BREAK!
[0:44:06] <BoneBagMel> wow
[0:44:08] <Aussie_Manny> FWOOM! CurseLit
[0:44:16] <BoneBagMel> that was really strong
[0:44:18] <BoneBagMel> like, visually
[0:44:42] <Aussie_Manny> M A T H S
[0:44:50] <heartlesshealer> =)
[0:44:51] <%Solidnick18> numbers monkaS
[0:44:51] <$JobbedBone> COLORS
[0:44:55] <Aussie_Manny> I'd just hit the thing. thebkSip
[0:44:58] <Hammatime8> Math! MATH!
[0:45:01] <BoneBagMel> No I don't want to do math
[0:45:02] <NiktenKing> Maffs
[0:45:05] <BoneBagMel> Immout
[0:45:07] <OToole42> so shield tsakes damage, armor takes damae, then health
[0:45:07] <heartlesshealer> 48 + 8 = 56
[0:45:08] <%Solidnick18> do the thing
[0:45:14] <Aussie_Manny> Why would they change math? MATH IS MATH! ashewyPUFF
[0:45:25] <$JobbedBone> How long is a second though? 🤔
[0:45:25] <OToole42> my god this keyboard
[0:45:35] <reonome> this is a weird system
[0:45:39] <Make_me_mad> Shield is a buffer that protects EVERYTHING else. Anything that goes through shields hits Armor and HP, but you have to get above the armor number to actually hit HP.
[0:45:39] <%Javaa01> No, the armor doesn't get cracked
[0:45:48] <+Ricochet_Frame> its all good fuck the shield then fuck the armor then fuck up his day lol
[0:45:57] <Make_me_mad> Shield is just a buffer over everything else. Armor is persistent damage protection until you break it.
[0:45:57] <+Regigangster> Warframe
[0:46:04] <Aussie_Manny> Shield as extra HP, and individual Armour points.
[0:46:05] <reonome> armor is just defense
[0:46:07] <jorniev> mass effect
[0:46:07] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It all makes more sense once you go through a couple battles
[0:46:25] <+Ricochet_Frame> slay the spire has the same combat set up
[0:46:26] <lotharrio> Shield is extra HP, armor is damage reduction on health damage.
[0:46:32] <heartlesshealer> If: DAMAGE - (ARMOR) > SHIELDS, Then: Apply remainder to HEALTH
[0:46:37] <%Javaa01> But yeah this is just the Warframe health system
[0:46:47] <%Javaa01> With not as absurd numbers
[0:47:43] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Are you insinuating that Inaros Prime has absurd health?
[0:47:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:48:10] <$JobbedBone> so a second is each of those pips at the top?
[0:48:22] <OToole42> each pip is 10 seconds
[0:48:28] <$JobbedBone> oh
[0:48:29] <heartlesshealer> 10 seconds is each pip
[0:48:31] <OToole42> as is the end of the bar
[0:48:36] <heartlesshealer> yeah what OToole42 said
[0:48:37] <%Solidnick18> ok
[0:48:53] <OToole42> what heartlesshealer said
[0:49:28] <Make_me_mad> Woolie there's a flashing pink health bar RIGHT THERE
[0:49:40] <OToole42> hp bar flashes to shoe expected damage
[0:49:44] <californaya> it is kinda hard to see it, the enemy is also pink
[0:49:45] <OToole42> show*
[0:50:06] <heartlesshealer> not the best enemy to look at the enemy health bar for the first time
[0:50:09] <OToole42> wonder if theres a coulour blind mode, can barely see half the effects
[0:50:14] <%cache_22> The pink UI elements could use a drop shadow or something I think.
[0:50:31] <+Pyroclase> I dunno what a flux war is but it sounds sick
[0:50:33] <$JobbedBone> depth of field + pixelart looks so strange to me

[0:52:04] <heartlesshealer> Exosuit Siblings
[0:52:28] <%YakumoYomi> That's a huge bitch!
[0:53:15] <californaya> just make sure that shit happens immediately, as opposed to after their turn
[0:53:15] <lotharrio> It's projecting on neutral.
[0:53:27] <+deviljhojho_> show em who is boss
[0:53:40] <OToole42> killshot is guaranteed 95% of the time
[0:54:03] <+fizzguy47> you can rely on it, as long as you make sure variables do not change
[0:54:29] <EternalJedi> bypass is a seperate thing, the shatter icon indicates how much armor it'll STRIP
[0:54:30] <%Javaa01> The shatter icon means it will break that number of armor points for further attacks
[0:54:31] <rbakervv> that's armor damage
[0:54:49] <nintega010> @WoolieVersus Holy crap when you said "here's Davion" you freaked me out cause that's my name spelled exactly like that. :D

[0:55:42] <%Peyote_> this game looks sick
[0:56:17] <%Javaa01> Time to learn about IPS
[0:56:20] <Make_me_mad> This game IS sick. Woolie's getting kind of overwhelmed right now though.
[0:56:27] <EternalJedi> thre's a frontload, but it's really not that complex once you get going
[0:57:24] <%a_goth_pancake> anybody else hearing Doom e1m1 in this battle theme or am I going crazy?
[0:57:45] <nintega010> God that's so weird hearing them say my name.
[0:58:10] <%YakumoYomi> @a_goth_pancake It's not just you. I definitely hear it.
[0:58:27] <Make_me_mad> You can cancel actions with mouse and keyboard for sure.
[0:58:37] <Make_me_mad> Probably a way to cancel it on controller, too.
[0:58:39] <lotharrio> What about just "B"
[0:58:41] <%Tearonex> @inspect units and then cancel action
[0:58:53] <Rusflex> i think it's RT
[0:59:14] <%Tearonex> @woolieversus inspect units then cancel action over the unit
[0:59:23] <$JobbedBone> moving camera messing with selection LUL
[0:59:35] <%Solidnick18> oh cool
[0:59:50] <+balouie> i have played this game for 10 hours and never realized taht
[0:59:55] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Oh shit, I didn't know that. That would have been really helpful in some of my runs
[1:00:01] <Make_me_mad> The moving camera is so cool though! Look at the background shift!
[1:00:03] <+balouie> I know I feel stupid now
[1:00:14] <%Javaa01> The damage on the light attack will be resisted, but the pushback will not be
[1:00:19] <%Tearonex> I’ve been playing too much of this game today LUL
[1:00:32] <Aquatic_Lotus> sunder
[1:00:36] <viciousgrim> do not assume things try to be sure
[1:00:50] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Xbox Gamepass for PC has been treating me well with all these games they've been offering lately
[1:00:59] <%Javaa01> Trading will not result in a crit
[1:01:34] <Make_me_mad> This game is really good.
[1:01:48] <nintega010> @WoolieVersus How are you saying Davions name?
[1:01:52] <+balouie> yeah I played this on gamepass loved it so much bought it on gog

[1:02:14] <Rusflex> Trading crits 100%
[1:02:22] <%Javaa01> Oh, interesting
[1:02:37] <tanarath> @woolieversus Normal will still delay him, apparently?
[1:03:25] <Make_me_mad> Combo = Combination, as in between two characters. That's why it and Flurry are separate categories.
[1:03:27] <+fizzguy47> X-slash!
[1:03:44] <alphalejandro> Basically a "limit bar"
[1:04:07] <FishTacosTonite> Woolie go watch Raised Among Wolves on HBOMAX now. doodMako
[1:05:12] <%a_goth_pancake> well, not now; he's streaming
[1:05:16] <EternalJedi> no RNG like that
[1:05:19] <EternalJedi> you can't miss
[1:05:20] <rbakervv> can't miss in this game
[1:05:33] <+sirHIXalot> This art is awesome
[1:05:33] <rbakervv> but combos take both actions
[1:05:34] <EternalJedi> there's arguably NO RNG in this gamer
[1:05:34] <FishTacosTonite> Well I know. lol doodLUL

[1:36:49] <heartlesshealer> right stick
[1:36:55] <Teyaric> You have exited the serious plot part of the game. It's all goofy Whedonesque zingers from here on out.
[1:36:58] <TigerClaws12> right stick
[1:37:11] <$JobbedBone> Wait no it was Atton that plays pazaak in his head

[1:39:59] <+pectusumbra> that's a camp skill
[1:40:00] <Teyaric> Cards are CAMPING SKILLS.
[1:40:19] <OToole42> cards are used in camp, they build friendship meter and give buffs
[1:40:33] <$JobbedBone> oh no they used the cool spelling D:

[1:43:23] <heartlesshealer> on the mark is on second 60
[1:43:47] <OToole42> but your buddy hits and crits
[1:44:08] <Teyaric> Now the downside of Breaking - they get moved to early in the next turn.
[1:44:33] <%Heavensguard92> Did just pass up a kill
[1:44:52] <Teyaric> In order to /get/ critted, yeah.
[1:44:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:44:52] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, and then that's where the green number comes in, knowing how far past the 60 mark they got pushed tells you when the enemies will do things next turn
[1:45:07] <+fizzguy47> @teyaric Sometimes you'd rather just shield tank instead of staggering
[1:45:09] <heartlesshealer> love it
[1:45:32] <+fizzguy47> Oof

[1:47:34] <Make_me_mad> Shields fully recharge at the end of combat.
[1:47:44] <heartlesshealer> they do?
[1:47:53] <%Solidnick18> maybe before he attacks
[1:47:55] <OToole42> shields heal, hp and armor do not
[1:47:56] <Make_me_mad> Armor and Health damage is persistent.
[1:48:02] <Make_me_mad> Shields recharge.
[1:48:08] <OToole42> only healed by pickups
[1:48:16] <NiktenKing> It also reduces defense

[1:49:35] <+fizzguy47> The map sprites ars adorable
[1:50:20] <heartlesshealer> squad?
[1:50:39] <OToole42> you can level up during, DNA is spent like souls in Dark soulds
[1:50:45] <Make_me_mad> Woolie continues to read 6 as 8 every time he sees it.
[1:51:10] <+pectusumbra> The Gurren Mk.II
[1:51:10] <+fizzguy47> yeah, smear that DNA all over me
[1:51:35] <NiktenKing> LUL
[1:51:44] <alphalejandro> Reggie: I see like an eagle
[1:51:53] <%DappercatEsquire> i heard woolie has really good vision
[1:51:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:52:14] <+fizzguy47> it's fine
[1:53:40] <SirMcSlushy> Im confused how the far at the top works, why does the smaller number on the green clock more them farther to the right.
[1:53:43] <SirMcSlushy> bar*
[1:54:37] <+fizzguy47> @sirmcslushy the clock shows how fast the attack comes out
[1:54:40] <+AsinPersuasion> is this the default party? i saw pat use the exact same guys
[1:54:50] <Make_me_mad> This is your starting 3, yeah.
[1:54:54] <+pectusumbra> I think it might be a first world thing
[1:55:14] <OToole42> @SirGO0SE each white pip is 10 seconds, the more time, the more your attack delays the enemy turn
[1:55:21] <OToole42> whoops
[1:55:25] <OToole42> @SirMcSlushy
[1:55:31] <SirMcSlushy> I think im seeing it.
[1:55:44] <+pectusumbra> I feel like it might still be better to just delete enemies when you can
[1:55:52] <+fizzguy47> @sirmcslushy the crit bonus shows how much they are delayed if you crit
[1:56:16] <OToole42> theres 0 misses
[1:56:27] <%SirGO0SE> made me double take tho @OToole42 LUL
[1:56:28] <+wicketpelican> Attacks never miss.
[1:56:40] <OToole42> @SirGO0SE too many sirs Ha
[1:56:47] <%SirGO0SE> its a good sign ;)
[1:56:47] <%Heavensguard92> One less enemy is always agood option
[1:56:55] <OToole42> True that
[1:57:07] <+AsinPersuasion> death is the best damage mitigation
[1:57:21] <+pectusumbra> Inspiration, and improvement!
[1:57:32] <lotharrio> The best defense is killing that motherfucker when he looks at you.
[1:57:53] <+pectusumbra> front and backline like your party I imagine
[1:58:24] <+fizzguy47> that tooltip is bugged in combat
[1:58:33] <+AsinPersuasion> stuns on crit no?
[1:58:35] <%Heavensguard92> Never really used titans blessing myself
[1:58:41] <+fizzguy47> it doesn't show the increased damage
[1:59:31] <%Heavensguard92> Every ability for saboteur is so useful

[2:01:20] <+pectusumbra> reminder your enemy is weak vs. laser
[2:01:35] <%emperordread> It's certainly Rogue Adjacent @Joe2187

[2:04:39] <+pectusumbra> this music is not bad
[2:04:52] <+thunka10> SourPls
[2:05:06] <+wicketpelican> This msuic is great
[2:05:12] <+AsinPersuasion> i keep thinking this game is related to dungeon of the endless/endless space
[2:05:18] <+wicketpelican> Woolie is doing a lot better than I expected, sadly he will not get punch girl in this session
[2:05:44] <+fizzguy47> all allies
[2:06:04] <+wicketpelican> Battlecry is really good with specials
[2:06:11] <%Javaa01> Taunting draws aggro to one characters, and buffs your allies
[2:06:34] <+wicketpelican> You only notice the aggro change if you have more than one front character,.
[2:06:35] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:08:02] <+wicketpelican> Blitz the early dude and Cleave anyone
[2:09:19] <maxpasta> SourPls
[2:10:01] <dapperskeleton69> the pastelverse
[2:10:30] <lotharrio> Preventing enemy crits makes sense.
[2:12:15] <%Akizea> Blitz is super powerful if sabo still has a turn
[2:12:32] <%Akizea> cleave the shit outta him
[2:12:35] <dapperskeleton69> blitz seems OP AF
[2:12:45] <+wicketpelican> Blitz gives almsot no damage, its only good to delay actions.
[2:12:49] <%Akizea> sabo is great for staggering
[2:12:50] <%Akizea> its amazing
[2:12:58] <%Heavensguard92> Break the enemy so they take more dmg
[2:12:59] <+wicketpelican> Later theres a better ability than Blitz, my favorite one actually
[2:13:11] <dapperskeleton69> whats it called wick?
[2:13:13] <%ironohki> I'm playing Warframe with this on the audio and the music fits well.
[2:13:16] <+wicketpelican> Plant Bomb
[2:13:25] <+Akizea> well blitz is still better for staggering
[2:13:29] <%Akizea> but plant bomb is amazing
[2:13:41] <%Heavensguard92> Wick is right
[2:13:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:13:43] <+wicketpelican> Plant Bomb is just cool, teleporting in the enemy and planting a C4 is ultra cool.
[2:13:57] <dapperskeleton69> that does sound super cool
[2:13:59] <+wicketpelican> Also, BIG DAMAGE
[2:14:10] <%Heavensguard92> Bomb is why Sabo is the best
[2:14:29] <+wicketpelican> Takes two turns tho, one for planting, one for exploding, but a character later can give you an extra turn, so you can do both in a single action, really good.
[2:14:45] <dapperskeleton69> brooo i actually really want this now
[2:15:09] <+wicketpelican> I recommend playing this game so much, brilliant design, every class is ultra fun. My favorite is Aegis.
[2:15:25] <alphalejandro> is irradiated the new bp?
[2:15:53] <dapperskeleton69> how much is it on switch?
[2:15:55] <%Heavensguard92> Can even save the bomb for someone to break for extra dmg
[2:16:33] <+wicketpelican> I dunno on Switch, I have on Xbox Pass, it feels like I'm stealing from the devs cuz only the subscription cost.
[2:16:50] <alphalejandro> increase social links
[2:16:54] <+fizzguy47> THEY FUCKIN
[2:17:02] <+wicketpelican> Social Links can generate new classes, by fucking.
[2:17:05] <dapperskeleton69> OH THE FUOCKIN
[2:17:39] <+wicketpelican> One of the classes is so cool man, the coolest.
[2:17:42] <dapperskeleton69> convince them to take bullets for eachother
[2:17:56] <+fizzguy47> purple cards are free
[2:18:05] <alphalejandro> unlock the ultimate personas
[2:18:05] <%Javaa01> Dynamic Duo is a free social link boost
[2:18:08] <DianaTheAscian> its a conversation prob
[2:18:23] <+wicketpelican> Get love woolie, realtionship points.
[2:18:33] <%Heavensguard92> Increase social for All out attacks
[2:18:56] <+wicketpelican> Heavens is right, social link sfor supers.
[2:18:58] <+fizzguy47> press RT to see overview
[2:19:00] <heartlesshealer> social link go!
[2:19:10] <Make_me_mad> The dynamic duo cards are for set characters.
[2:19:15] <Make_me_mad> Based on who beat the boss.
[2:19:16] <DianaTheAscian> its specific
[2:19:18] <EternalJedi> Duo's are specific
[2:19:20] <heartlesshealer> Blue outline is Card Owner
[2:19:30] <lotharrio> That's who it showed when you got the card.
[2:19:50] <+fizzguy47> @make_me_mad It's unclear, tbh. It feels random sometimes
[2:20:16] <Make_me_mad> @fizzguy47 I never tested it, but I assumed it was based on who the last two characters to hit the boss were.
[2:20:49] <heartlesshealer> self-flagellation
[2:20:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:21:08] <+wicketpelican> @Make_me_mad its not, the Support characters also win sometimes. I think it's random.
[2:21:22] <alphalejandro> muther
[2:21:34] <+fizzguy47> @make_me_mad I thought so too, but it's not always true
[2:21:47] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Vanel Altair will return!
[2:22:25] <heartlesshealer> Top two not checked
[2:22:39] <+fizzguy47> i hate that exploiting his weakness makes him stronger

[2:38:40] <%emperordread> Seein stars
[2:38:49] <+PapaGravestone> yo how is this? I just saw that this stream was live and I've been eying this game for a minute
[2:38:52] <+Jaysky> [ R U N G]
[2:39:03] <+Jaysky> Shookith
[2:39:21] <+fizzguy47> Rattled means you take more stagger time delay
[2:39:31] <%Heavensguard92> Embrace Sabotage
[2:40:51] <%ItsKamWithAK> @PapaGravestone I cant answer if its any good as I just popped into the stream myself but its on gamepass which is only $1 right now
[2:40:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:41:01] <%ItsKamWithAK> figured Id try it out that way
[2:41:49] <+PapaGravestone> @ItsKamWithAK oh yeah I keep forgetting game pass is also a pc thing
[2:41:59] <+wicketpelican> Game Pass on PC is crazy good
[2:42:13] <+wicketpelican> Tons of indie good games, theres Yakuza 0, Kiwami and Kiwami 2, a bunch of other stuff too
[2:42:33] <lotharrio> Build that Fury, I guess. Stun is amazing.
[2:42:34] <zenanon> Outer Worlds, all the Halos and Final Fantasy
[2:42:36] <%ItsKamWithAK> As did I, I also realized how you cant talk about gamepass without sounding like a shill for Microsoft
[2:42:36] <+wicketpelican> Indie games that just launched are in there too. Contagion was there at the launch day.
[2:43:08] <+wicketpelican> The only shitty thing about the GamePass is that you can't mod games... Which is a HUGE point against it.
[2:43:13] <%Heavensguard92> And like that, Nodo proves his worth PogChamp
[2:43:29] <YharnamNighthawk> This reminds me of Hyper Light Drifter
[2:43:34] <YharnamNighthawk> Maybe graphics wise
[2:43:40] <%ItsKamWithAK> Yeah but for trying games like this it serves its purpose, if I like it ill just buy it on steam
[2:43:52] <+wicketpelican> Is more close to Dungeon of Endless in the graphics department. Or Children of Morta.
[2:44:32] <YharnamNighthawk> Man, I bought Dungeons of Endless and stopped playing it for some reason. I might go back and try it again
[2:44:57] <+wicketpelican> Every time I tried playing Dungeon of Endless I stopped also. Dunno why, just didn't stick.
[2:45:21] <+wicketpelican> Well Woolie you can have 6 party members and theres about 15 classes.
[2:45:39] <zenanon> Dungeon of the Endless is also on gamepass pc lol
[2:45:40] <+wicketpelican> And all those classes have variations
[2:46:05] <heartlesshealer> no cleave
[2:46:25] <+wicketpelican> Woolie is spamming Cleave way too much, on later stages he will be demolished.
[2:46:34] <zenanon> Nodo's blitz skill is clutch for breaks
[2:46:38] <+wicketpelican> First World is free
[2:46:46] <heartlesshealer> the problem is it's just such a good simple name for a sword attack
[2:47:09] <heartlesshealer> jumps up in the brain immediately
[2:47:42] <+wicketpelican> The backgrounds of this game are also insane. I wonder how they made it, I can't pull this off on Unity easily,.
[2:49:54] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> between this game and Octopath, I think adding shadows to pixel sprites is some hidden tech to make pixel art look incredible
[2:49:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:54:14] <%Javaa01> These green cards come back each time you camp
[2:54:19] <pi_in_the_sci> those come back
[2:54:24] <heartlesshealer> green cards respawn
[2:54:29] <%mitchteck> Green come back
[2:54:32] <%Tearonex> @woolieversus the cards come back at the start of every camp
[2:54:35] <lotharrio> What about red ones?
[2:54:35] <%Heavensguard92> Abuse the cards
[2:54:35] <+fizzguy47> only if they say exhaust
[2:54:46] <heartlesshealer> ^
[2:54:55] <+wicketpelican> Always heal first, shield buff second, then damage.
[2:55:05] <%Heavensguard92> Lvl up those social links
[2:55:17] <+wicketpelican> Yeah also try to level up social, special skills and good passives.
[2:55:33] <+wicketpelican> The supers/combo attacks comes from the fucking.
[2:55:48] <%Heavensguard92> Get that loot
[2:56:23] <+SWindleFeD> Why is there no rpg that has a hate mechanic instead of a friendship mechanic, just acting like a complete dick to your rival/s
[2:57:30] <Sloavon> how's the game so far?
[2:57:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:58:29] <heartlesshealer> huge guts
[2:58:35] <%Javaa01> You want armor damage
[2:58:49] <heartlesshealer> you want to deal those cracked yellow shields of damage
[2:59:23] <lotharrio> Save up for the stun, next turn.
[3:01:22] <heartlesshealer> uh oh, slowed
[3:02:22] <TomFrancis_> stuns are op in this genre of game
[3:03:03] <MinnitMan> they weren't lying on the podcast, these graphics are incredible
[3:03:09] <+fizzguy47> @tomfrancis_ Most of the characters only get one, while enemies can stun multiple times per combat
[3:04:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> COWARD

[3:06:07] <%Javaa01> Also a gear crate
[3:06:10] <%Javaa01> On this tile
[3:06:12] <+GenesisKnight> isn't there loot up north
[3:07:51] <%Javaa01> Armor steal seems very good
[3:07:53] <heartlesshealer> stealing health or stealing armor sounds good
[3:08:11] <heartlesshealer> 3
[3:08:17] <heartlesshealer> you can stash for later
[3:08:29] <heartlesshealer> UMM
[3:08:37] <%Heavensguard92> You need to recover armor somehow
[3:08:45] <PanicSwytch> Is this game on console also?
[3:08:57] <lotharrio> @PanicSwytch Not just yet
[3:09:12] <heartlesshealer> there are runs where you can totally gun it
[3:09:33] <heartlesshealer> it saves after last fight when you Save & Quit apparently
[3:09:43] <%Javaa01> Yeah at this point, it's probably suicide to go for the boss
[3:10:20] <heartlesshealer> there's a high level equip chest north, and then there's all that stuff to the east/southeast
[3:10:25] <lotharrio> There was an epic box up north of you.
[3:10:31] <heartlesshealer> full heal is Party
[3:10:33] <+dmtjinni> \woolz
[3:11:03] <+Pyroclase> It's unbelievable how good this looks
[3:11:11] <heartlesshealer> north has mini-boss, other path is normal fight
[3:11:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pretty
[3:11:36] <+SWindleFeD> So in the stream layout I can see Vergil and Necalli, but I don't know who the rest are, can someone tell me who they are please

[3:26:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what carries over
[3:26:45] <heartlesshealer> defense and pray
[3:26:55] <+kekkerscrew> If you die you die.
[3:26:59] <MinnitMan> welp
[3:27:00] <NiktenKing> He will not, he will not be moved
[3:27:10] <lotharrio> Trick Shot is once per fight right?
[3:27:11] <heartlesshealer> early bullet hell is RNG saying "No"
[3:27:16] <%Heavensguard92> Trick shot couldve stopped that bullet hell
[3:27:16] <+kekkerscrew> This is a big beefy boy. I've not beaten him yet.
[3:27:16] <%mitchteck> Defend
[3:27:42] <+kekkerscrew> I've come close, my next run might take him
[3:27:54] <%Akizea> i got super lucky on my very first clear of him
[3:27:59] <%Akizea> but now i think i got him down
[3:28:01] <+fizzguy47> the damage is spread across all randomly

[3:29:36] <+GenesisKnight> Gotta read that fine print
[3:29:47] <heartlesshealer> Enjoy learning the Roguelike part of the game mechanics!
[3:29:47] <%mitchteck> Ooof
[3:30:06] <%mitchteck> Big oofs
[3:30:27] <viciousgrim> this game permadeath?
[3:30:47] <%Heavensguard92> Battlecry and trick shot are super useful
[3:31:02] <heartlesshealer> yes and no? You send the lil robot buddy into another reality where the you over there didn't fight yet
[3:31:02] <+kekkerscrew> It is what it is
[3:31:10] <+GenesisKnight> Whatever happens happens
[3:31:17] <%mitchteck> Blitz
[3:31:20] <%Javaa01> Righteousness is up and will cancel the attack
[3:31:29] <+kekkerscrew> yes
[3:31:34] <%Heavensguard92> Blitz
[3:31:35] <heartlesshealer> Righteousness has the stun property
[3:31:43] <lotharrio> Blitz will earn you a turn.
[3:31:45] <NiktenKing> Will stun and won't contribute to break
[3:32:16] <%Heavensguard92> Blitz 1st then Righteousness
[3:32:21] <heartlesshealer> umm
[3:32:53] <NiktenKing> Reggie with the strats
[3:33:33] <+GenesisKnight> There's a chance
[3:33:36] <dapperskeleton69> this is real RPG hours
[3:33:38] <heartlesshealer> stuns eats the pushback meter completely
[3:33:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp

[3:36:38] <NiktenKing> LUL
[3:36:42] <dapperskeleton69> love is just chemicals in your brain
[3:36:42] <+Pyroclase> oh MAN
[3:36:44] <+GenesisKnight> FeelsBadMan
[3:37:03] <heartlesshealer> Bullet Hell is persisting. RNG does not like Woolie
[3:37:28] <%Javaa01> Yeah, this bullet hell is gonna seal the deal for this run
[3:37:49] <+fizzguy47> blitz is mvp
[3:37:59] <bevyrage> he'll be able to defend and survive it again
[3:38:01] <%Tearonex> I got 3 bullet hells in a row the first time I fought this guy, is that on purpose you you can’t beat him?
[3:38:06] <@Menitta> bullet hell>
[3:38:07] <@Menitta> ?
[3:38:21] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[3:38:23] <bevyrage> bullet hell is a high damage, but randomly assigned attack
[3:38:24] <%Joe2187> what does bullet hell do?
[3:38:28] <@Menitta> Oooh
[3:38:32] <heartlesshealer> bullet hell is bullet hell
[3:38:36] <@Menitta> That's hell indeed
[3:38:38] <heartlesshealer> lots of shot, lots of damage
[3:38:40] <NiktenKing> Defend?
[3:38:41] <%Javaa01> @Joe2187 It kills you
[3:38:47] <+fizzguy47> 10 shots across the board
[3:38:50] <+kekkerscrew> It's been an honor
[3:38:58] <+GenesisKnight> We livin
[3:39:05] <heartlesshealer> defending matters in this game <3
[3:39:08] <%kyh9> Just holdYEYEYE
[3:39:13] <bevyrage> for real if you have full shields you shouldn't get merc'd by bullet hell
[3:39:18] <bevyrage> unless rng says you die
[3:39:18] <%FairOnFire> we live, bitch
[3:39:25] <+fizzguy47> RNG smiles upon you
[3:39:33] <+wicketpelican> It does, this world is free, but its ok to lose, you'll get really good improvements after the first reset
[3:39:33] <+teh_rawk> damn this looks gorgeous
[3:40:04] <%Heavensguard92> If break shields, he may reboot again
[3:40:11] <+kekkerscrew> Sheilds down Real Damage
[3:40:38] <+fizzguy47> mmmm
[3:40:47] <heartlesshealer> UMM
[3:40:52] <heartlesshealer> Shields is post-hit
[3:40:53] <+cubbywolf> it tells you when they go
[3:41:02] <lotharrio> Prevent his crit
[3:41:10] <ofalconer> It's gonna crit anything that comes after his attack
[3:41:18] <bevyrage> crit on the timeline
[3:41:26] <heartlesshealer> RIP Robo Cleric o7
[3:41:30] <%Javaa01> Yeah trying to give yourself shields is just gonna get you hit even harder
[3:41:47] <+cubbywolf> woolie listen to the universe
[3:41:54] <TehMud> I just got this game a couple hours ago thanks to you guys. I just got DESTROYED by this guy RIP
[3:41:57] <%Javaa01> He's not gonna live until he gets a chance to up his shields
[3:42:19] <+cubbywolf> if he crits the robot will it be knocked back a turn?
[3:42:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:42:24] <%kyh9> Wait, isn't that the timeline at the top?
[3:42:29] <CureMode666> woolie when is the hades play thru
[3:42:36] <bevyrage> timeline is at the top yes. enemy is on the bottom with a CRIT
[3:42:38] <heartlesshealer> Napalm is less bad than bullet hell, RNG just hates you with spamming AoE attacks
[3:42:41] <+cubbywolf> its either quick attacks or all block
[3:42:45] <%Heavensguard92> Crit on xurx dies
[3:43:03] <NiktenKing> He will crit for 91 if you try to shield
[3:43:05] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:43:07] <TehMud> @cubbywolf No. When the counter by their icon on the top bar is at 0 you can't knock them back anymore.
[3:43:19] <+cubbywolf> ah thats what the number is
[3:43:28] <%Heavensguard92> Woolie is really holding on
[3:43:38] <heartlesshealer> Gamma Beam is only just now coming out
[3:43:44] <+fizzguy47> holy shit this is great
[3:43:51] <+kekkerscrew> woolie is doing really good
[3:44:00] <%Heavensguard92> Break for Righteousness
[3:44:01] <heartlesshealer> woolie is doing really good
[3:44:06] <%Joe2187> What does break mean?
[3:44:10] <TehMud> Way better than I did
[3:44:15] <+cubbywolf> if woolie attacked with the 2 characters then break, would that be optimal?
[3:44:15] <bevyrage> break means the turn gets pushed back a round
[3:44:16] <heartlesshealer> Break as in breaking their turn
[3:44:19] <+cubbywolf> or does it not matter?
[3:44:37] <lotharrio> Battlecry is a taunt, will redirect the focus.
[3:44:42] <%Heavensguard92> You got righteousness for next turn
[3:44:47] <heartlesshealer> No Righteousness stun if no fury
[3:44:49] <%Javaa01> You have Stun next turn with Righteousness
[3:44:55] <%mitchteck> Titans stregnth
[3:45:07] <%Javaa01> Righteousness is reusable
[3:45:09] <heartlesshealer> it's the other shot
[3:45:11] <+fizzguy47> They've used Righteousness
[3:45:17] <heartlesshealer> the other shot is One and Done
[3:45:24] <Blank9> only reason he can't use it is he blitzed with the other character
[3:45:24] <%Heavensguard92> Save 4 righteousness
[3:45:27] <%Javaa01> It's on cooldown because you Blitzed
[3:45:39] <lotharrio> I thought it said combos are always once per battle?
[3:45:47] <%Joe2187> is there no way to heal?
[3:45:49] <+fizzguy47> Righteousness does not come back
[3:45:52] <%Javaa01> But since it's a free action on the timeline, you can get it instantly next turn and kill his attack
[3:45:58] <heartlesshealer> ?????
[3:46:13] <heartlesshealer> I'm probably wrong, I don't remember the text on dual tech tutorial
[3:46:14] <+kekkerscrew> healing is on equipment from what I 've seen
[3:46:23] <+fizzguy47> Combos are once per combat, they used it earlier
[3:46:27] <+cubbywolf> not enough hp?
[3:46:38] <%kyh9> LOL

[3:47:10] <lotharrio> Battlecry is a taunt, you can redirect the attack at least.
[3:47:11] <%Javaa01> Well, that's a bummer
[3:47:12] <+cubbywolf> GOTEE
[3:47:20] <$hypermegashun> you need fury for combo

[3:54:21] <+Krasmeyts> Game is fantastic
[3:54:21] <NiktenKing> It pushes 30s

[3:55:38] <EternalJedi> *detonate
[3:55:38] <%GrumbleGrouse> McGwinnus subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[3:55:47] <+Pyroclase> WEll, you saw six slots.
[3:55:52] <lotharrio> Didn't get that marine looking guy.
[3:55:56] <+Pyroclase> I assume there's currently six characters then
[3:56:00] <%Joe2187> I erronously thought woolie was playing Star Gladiator for a second when he announced it on twitter....
[3:56:01] <Blank9> @ShinobiPhoenix It's on roosterteeth's site
[3:56:01] <+fizzguy47> you gonna learn, Woolie
[3:56:15] <+ShinobiPhoenix> do you have to be a paid member to see it?

[3:57:27] <+Superbro64> inb4 this one off becomes a two off
[3:58:04] <+wicketpelican> Sadly woolie didn't see the Punchgirl
[3:58:19] <%emperordread> one more run, one more run
[3:58:26] <ZeeJiggle> Ye save it for another time
[3:58:36] <%Javaa01> Yeah at best you'd get like one half decent run out of it
[3:59:06] <+wicketpelican> Woolie it's a punchgirl in a mecha armor.
[3:59:11] <%Javaa01> And it takes like 3-ish runs to properly get past the spaghetti of the rhythm
[3:59:16] <+Fattness132> its a roguelike
[3:59:19] <+Pyroclase> it's a roguelike
[3:59:22] <ZeeJiggle> BPM is a roguelike
[3:59:35] <%Javaa01> The structure is very similar to Binding of Isaac
[3:59:58] <+ShinobiPhoenix> roguelike or roguelite?
[4:00:45] <%Javaa01> It's a Roguelite, but the vertical progression elements are very light in BPM
[4:01:43] <mightyfat> Pat says runs in this game are super long

[4:05:10] <+Pyroclase> I'm hearing very polarized views on BPM and I'm really interested to see your take
[4:05:16] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[4:05:18] <+cubbywolf> some people...
[4:05:27] <+cubbywolf> some people advance humanity as a whole
[4:05:31] <Blank9> like ren and stimpy
[4:05:35] <%Javaa01> Auto rhythm is a bit much, but yeah, crank down that saturation by at least like 20%, it's pretty hard to see items at default saturation

[4:07:32] <@Menitta> I wish there would be more SNK style pixel art games. Aiming for realistic pixel art, not just pixel art.
[4:07:53] <@Menitta> Like they have an art style but they're just using spritesd
