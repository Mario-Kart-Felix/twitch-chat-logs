[0:04:43] <@CaptainPileDriver> this Evo is all solid
[0:04:46] <@Solidus_113> Them's Fightin Herds kinda got robbed, but it at least got the spotlight in the first place
[0:04:48] <+alexisofthestars> 11 years later
[0:04:49] <RyuuAoi> Reggie is boycotting EVO now due to Melee
[0:04:53] <%xerotwo> MAHVEL AINT DEAD YET THO

[0:05:05] <Darren716> I lived bitch
[0:05:05] <+orochiblood> high level KOF is nutty
[0:05:06] <leith_aziz> Guilty Gear making it was good enough for me TPFufun
[0:05:07] <deviljhojho_> more like GranWHO
[0:05:07] <@CaptainPileDriver> granblue is still updating
[0:05:08] <+healnavi> cygames paid a lot of money Kappa
[0:05:09] <Aussie_Manny> Odd choice.
[0:05:15] <%mr_sups> GranBlue did get fucked from COvid
[0:05:15] <%livlinn> it's pretty spaceyeenYeen
[0:05:15] <@Menitta> can they do the rollback to the things
[0:05:16] <Ramasama13> i find granblue fun, but god march 2020
[0:05:17] <DaKnightWarrior> Happy about Granblue!
[0:05:19] <BlackermanZX> granbuile back from the dead
[0:05:19] <+Xero_J> Granblue is still holding on, which I appreciate
[0:05:19] <GHouseduivel> :O
[0:05:22] <%xerotwo> ROLLBACK FOR GRANBLUE
[0:05:24] <Vaunno> GranWH OMEGALUL
[0:05:24] <deviljhojho_> it didnt help nobody
[0:05:24] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:05:26] <$ggbhtg> Granblue's still getting content, every EVO game has recent updates @WoolieVersus
[0:05:27] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Bad netcode killed that game
[0:05:28] <leith_aziz> Covid could not have hit at a worse time. But yes, the netcode added fuel to the fire
[0:05:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> No, Granblue was fuckin MURDERED by the pandemic
[0:05:31] <+alexisofthestars> PANDEMIC NETCODE
[0:05:31] <Aussie_Manny> I've heard "just okay" things about Granblue.
[0:05:32] <%okuriskyles> the pandemic was a very big problem
[0:05:38] <DosPalmas> granblue was the sacrificial lamb for rollback
[0:05:38] <+Jiggisnipe> Combobreaker showed that Granblue was popular
[0:05:39] <%mr_sups> COMORBIDITY
[0:05:40] <Astrophizz> mmm those dlc prices
[0:05:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> disregard valid points, embrace Rollback shilling
[0:05:43] <RyuuAoi> Pandemic hurts. Yes
[0:05:46] <leith_aziz> Both Woolie and Reggie make good points cohhNotes
[0:05:53] <SerpentScintilla> hey yo, isnt forgotten land coming out on the 18th?
[0:05:53] <XoftheTITANS> when in doubt, blame the pandemic
[0:05:57] <%NopeBadguy> you're both right
[0:05:58] <TheAzureOracle> I can't believe Reggie hates rollback /s
[0:05:58] <%dizzy_108> dizzy_108 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:05:59] <HarshNerf> people talking about pandemic in past tense now?
[0:06:00] <+sandwich_jones> trans rights yall
[0:06:01] <%ATentacleMonster> people were busting a nut over gb when it came out LUL
[0:06:08] <RyuuAoi> But pandemic also could have helped
[0:06:10] <+LastHazzerd> i think in this day and age, you deserve the punishment of not having good netcode
[0:06:11] <$ggbhtg> Please Fix The Netcode
[0:06:11] <@Menitta> At least pre pandemic, if your game didn't have rollback or good Netcode, it wasn't a guarantee your game was dead. see DBFZ
[0:06:12] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie it was 2020, the pandemic made people shift
[0:06:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> But the director of the game, FKHR hears about rollback and is definitely considering adding it
[0:06:29] <+Jiggisnipe> Menitta is right
[0:06:38] <Jaysky> Hey Nintendo update your shit
[0:06:38] <miucsa51> Harada still rejects rollback NotLikeThis
[0:06:40] <+hoenhime344> i love elden ring
[0:06:46] <+hoenhime344> it cured my ED
[0:06:47] <+sandwich_jones> surprised playstation all stars isn't in considering sony
[0:06:56] <+Jiggisnipe> Harada still saying Tekken is 3
[0:06:58] <Vaunno> @jaysky "lol nah"
[0:06:59] <majindusto> PANDEMIC  FUCKED ALL KINDS OF SHIT
[0:07:03] <%Shad0wTag> Delay cringe netcode
[0:07:12] <+alexisofthestars> Thoughts on the Mike Z's version of GGPO?
[0:07:16] <$ggbhtg> @Jiggisnipe what do you mean by "still"?
[0:07:19] <RyuuAoi> It's dead
[0:07:19] <%shadepman> arcsys’ been rolling out netcode updates for a bunch of past games. hope granblue gets it eventually
[0:07:20] <Jaysky> @vaunno girldmDead
[0:07:21] <nintega010> @sandwich_jones you really thought it had a shot?
[0:07:24] <@CaptainPileDriver> I mean, it was pretty big at frosty's so idk how dead it is
[0:07:24] <majindusto> lol
[0:07:26] <yukichocomilk> i'd play granblue a lot if it wasn't for the garbage netcode
[0:07:34] <+TopTieramisu> i'd say granblue has a better chance than dbfz
[0:07:36] <%Shad0wTag> HEY WELL DNF NEXT YEAR!
[0:07:39] <+TopTieramisu> for rollback
[0:07:45] <+healnavi> Picking games based on their community???
[0:07:51] <+polothegreatest> gaccha money solves anything plagueHeh
[0:07:53] <+sandwich_jones> dbzf rollback when
[0:07:53] <+Jiggisnipe> @ggbhtg he has opinions on rollback
[0:07:54] <@Solidus_113> DNF and P4AU next year 100%
[0:07:56] <$ggbhtg> but still Granblue has recent content updates, like the rest
[0:07:56] <%NopeBadguy> was wondering if you've been keeping up with the latest artesian news?
[0:07:57] <leith_aziz> Interestingly enough, Granblue took I think 1 - 2 years to hit 500K sales, as Strive hit that milestone during it's first months. I suppouse I was underestimating GG's "nicheness", which is a good thing for me cohhO
[0:08:03] <+pectusumbra> Granblue DOES make a lot of money
[0:08:05] <@CaptainPileDriver> man I wish it was p4au instead
[0:08:10] <leith_aziz> Curious about the MVC2 stuff
[0:08:12] <+BackwardCap> Granblue might have lived a better life if they didn't botch the release so hard. gildedDerp
[0:08:15] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[0:08:18] <%Shad0wTag> P4AU and DNF for Evo
[0:08:23] <+TopTieramisu> strive got a lot of great word of mouth because of its netcode
[0:08:24] <+Jiggisnipe> people were still playing it somehow
[0:08:25] <+sandwich_jones> sf5 go away challenge
[0:08:27] <%shadepman> prolly woulda been smash if nintendo didn’t back out
[0:08:30] <+Xero_J> Last I heard, the Granblue devs want to put rollback, they're just having a tough time getting it to work
[0:08:34] <@Menitta> P4AU was hype as FUCK in 2015
[0:08:38] <RyuuAoi> Stick a fork in it
[0:08:41] <alphalejandro> Skullgirls is alive
[0:08:49] <+TopTieramisu> kof at evo is always hype
[0:08:49] <@CaptainPileDriver> yeah fair. I've heard literally no one talk about it
[0:08:58] <leith_aziz> MVC2 stuff
[0:09:04] <leith_aziz> Curious what'll happen
[0:09:08] <+sandwich_jones> marvel vs samshow
[0:09:09] <@Solidus_113> also Granblue is mad expensive with all the DLC and never goes on sale
[0:09:12] <Jaysky> Any time a Kanji was in a tourney it was hype
[0:09:17] <%xerotwo> SPIRIT BOMB
[0:09:18] <+TopTieramisu> bluepoint remake for mvc2 PogChamp
[0:09:22] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 That didnt help either
[0:09:31] <leith_aziz> Isnt that EVO side games?
[0:09:35] <+sandwich_jones> marvel vs konami
[0:09:45] <%X2Eliah> Oh btw. Idk if you know this... Artesian Builds just fired all their employees, their bank accounts are frozen, and the ceo has said to reject all refund requests. The company's dead.
[0:09:46] <@CaptainPileDriver> they probably will tbh since it's Evo
[0:09:47] <+sandwich_jones> bomberman wolverine team up
[0:09:47] <@Menitta> Can we get a side tournament that's modded UMVC3? LUL
[0:09:58] <CyrusVGZ> The MCU ruined Marvel vs. Capcom. Prove me wrong.
[0:10:02] <leith_aziz> Does EVO usually do that with upcoming games that havent come out? cohhHmm
[0:10:07] <Vaunno> @solidus_113 full price because gacha whales will always bite KEKW
[0:10:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bring back the Catherine side tourney
[0:10:12] <+TopTieramisu> not MCU, disney
[0:10:15] <@Squdnate> I'm just happy that KOF is back on the menu for Evo
[0:10:30] <leith_aziz> Disney is always the first thing to blame for most things
[0:10:34] <leith_aziz> cohhNotes

[0:12:57] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus I was listening to a radio show that's called "assertion against assertion" where they deep dive into assertions, and this was today's one. The normally come with a conclusion, but couldnt with this one.
[0:12:57] <%solracc25> But define a door in context
[0:12:57] <nickynack_> grocery cart wheels ez
[0:13:02] <+sandwich_jones> someone dun took my door

[0:13:48] <%livlinn> lucidWasted lucidWasted lucidWasted
[0:13:50] <leith_aziz> Is the question: which has more utillity?
[0:13:51] <+sandwich_jones> wheels can be naturally occuring. doors need to be made with purpose
[0:13:52] <@Menitta> Also what defines a wheel? Lego makes a ton
[0:13:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> @lion_kun says who?! Kappa

[0:14:03] <+Dova573> nope
[0:14:03] <dd44dostivei> are gears and mechanisms still wheels
[0:14:06] <leith_aziz> If yes, then I'd say Wheels if walls dont count

[0:20:04] <%okuriskyles> in america, there's probably at least one door for every person. but in parts of the world where people are more likely to share sleeping spaces, hmm.
[0:20:10] <%faytthepally> Do gears and cogwheels count??
[0:20:10] <%KyoryUtchy> If we're going "wheels as a concept" then we're going into the realm of the "wheel" as a simple machine.  In which case all gears, rollers, pulley systems etc. are subcatacories of "wheel".
[0:20:10] <NickHatesSnow> Like fridges and freezers also have doors
[0:20:11] <+zaitje> Is a gate a door?

[0:20:16] <GHouseduivel> 8 wheels per car
[0:20:16] <iambqb> Yeah any office building with wheeled chairs, that's like 4 wheels per worker minimum
[0:20:18] <@Menitta> But the amount of transportation we as a SOCIETY rely on is astronomical
[0:20:19] <+bobilli0n> Doors move
[0:20:19] <Darkdrill> Wheels would win skateboards shops would win on there own

[0:21:23] <leith_aziz> Wheels have had more use throughout history than doors, so I lean towards wheels
[0:21:23] <%okuriskyles> is it racist to say folding doors don't count as doors
[0:21:24] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL

[0:33:18] <Darren716> Also winter tires aren't new wheels
[0:33:18] <@DashXero> Gears are just wheels with teeth.
[0:33:18] <badugidugi> Woolie bought out by big wheel corp, sad.
[0:33:19] <+RealThiele> do tire chains become a wheel on use?

[0:33:26] <@CaptainPileDriver> woolie I work in a shipping warehouse we ship a lot of doors and wheels
[0:33:27] <Sonicdy> You said that, by that meaning, every door have atleast 1 WHEEL
[0:33:28] <velgaduere> PLUS wheels are inherently more useful than doors. do we ever talk about reinventing the DOOR?? NO, the wheel was a LANDMARK INVENTION
[0:33:28] <exnuart> is the engine belt a wheel too?

[0:34:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> doors existed before wheels
[0:34:16] <Karochi> putting a rock in front of a cave is a door
[0:34:16] <+allups> no hing
[0:34:17] <Aussie_Manny> I think the door was invented first.
[0:34:18] <Darkdrill> New Stunlock unlocked
[0:34:19] <+RealThiele> turn the rock make it a wheel
[0:34:19] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:34:19] <nyacoo> Is the opening you create when you remove a door still a door?
[0:34:19] <@CaptainPileDriver> you don't need a wheel for shelter
[0:34:20] <+sandwich_jones> mobile shelter
[0:34:20] <Carlioo> is a cave opening a door
[0:34:21] <+fusukok> A big rock or a big trree bark counts as a door
[0:34:24] <leith_aziz> I assume wheel, since most caves werent covered
[0:34:26] <alphalejandro> the original shelters were caves
[0:34:28] <okamiizero> Cavemen had wheels, caves don't have doors
[0:34:29] <+EdgySalad> This is incredible
[0:34:29] <%Lion_kun> What a curtain of leaves isn't good enough?
[0:34:29] <%ATentacleMonster> stone tablet cave covers are doors
[0:34:32] <%Juriasu> the time of the door ended when the wheel was invented
[0:34:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> entry ways are doors
[0:34:36] <badugidugi> Google says door and wheel were invented roughly around same time :O
[0:34:37] <%livlinn> succinWhat succinWhat succinWhat
[0:34:38] <RyuuAoi> Slab of wood, Woolie!
[0:34:39] <+healnavi> Kirby is a door
[0:34:39] <Darkdrill> @Carlioo no it has to go open and close
[0:34:40] <+garsamm> is the opening itself not a door?
[0:34:40] <+projectmanatees> are we really taking comments from a dude who thinks throwing up in a shirt is a good idea
[0:34:45] <exnuart> is a snow machine track a wheel?
[0:34:45] <leith_aziz> cohhHmm
[0:34:47] <velgaduere> @CaptainPileDriver you don't technically need a door for shelter either
[0:34:48] <RyuuAoi> Fred Flinstone had a door!
[0:34:49] <%DreyfussFrost> But if you have a cover you can move to block that opening, even if it's not on hinges, is that not a door?
[0:34:51] <%ATentacleMonster> yes
[0:34:51] <@CaptainPileDriver> yes
[0:34:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> YES
[0:34:51] <+healnavi> YES
[0:34:52] <+Jiggisnipe> yrd
[0:34:53] <%Kriss1827> yes
[0:34:53] <SeBigBoss> Rock big enough to be cave door has to be rolled so it wheel
[0:34:54] <+Jiggisnipe> yes
[0:34:54] <Aussie_Manny> Yes.
[0:34:55] <%MrP33Ps> yes
[0:34:55] <Vaunno> cave openings and barriers should count
[0:34:56] <%DreyfussFrost> I think it would
[0:34:57] <GHouseduivel> Yeah
[0:34:57] <TheAzureOracle> That rock's a door
[0:34:58] <Darkdrill> no
[0:34:58] <%Lion_kun> IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR JESUS
[0:34:59] <%livlinn> yes
[0:35:00] <Afrosamasenpai> nah that's a door
[0:35:00] <CrimsonGargoyle> The Furtive Door, so easily forgotten.
[0:35:00] <+sandwich_jones> yes
[0:35:01] <+fusukok> Is the poop flap in bottom pjs considered a door?
[0:35:01] <+healnavi> YES THEY ARE
[0:35:02] <GHouseduivel> Its also a wheel
[0:35:02] <@Menitta> I can definitively confirm, shelters help wheels more than doors.
[0:35:02] <badugidugi> a rock door!
[0:35:03] <+RealThiele> Rock= wheel
[0:35:04] <@Squdnate> Now chat, let's count the amount of doors and wheels in Kirby and FF6 together
[0:35:04] <%xjn_> jesus take the door
[0:35:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHEELDOORS HOLY SHIT
[0:35:04] <Brothermanhyll> Woolie vs. God early sneak peek
[0:35:04] <KobeTeeth90> are Rocks DOORs
[0:35:04] <exnuart> THATS A DOOR
[0:35:04] <TheAzureOracle> Then the cogs on an elevator aren't wheels
[0:35:05] <+hoenhime344> its the concept of a door
[0:35:06] <Aussie_Manny> It functions AS a door.
[0:35:06] <%sssoapy> It has to be a door
[0:35:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> That rock is a door woolie
[0:35:06] <leith_aziz> Is The Rock a door? cohhHmm
[0:35:06] <velgaduere> it's a proto-door
[0:35:07] <+sandwich_jones> all rocks are doors and wheels
[0:35:07] <%ATentacleMonster> that's fucked up Woolie they didn't have handles yet
[0:35:08] <+ChancellorOfLights> not all obstacles are doors
[0:35:08] <+Jiggisnipe> that's a rock door LUL
[0:35:08] <RyuuAoi> Jesus take the wheel!
[0:35:09] <%smieguish> rocks are doors
[0:35:10] <+johntonne> I was gone for 20, We’re still talking about doors?
[0:35:10] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> rocks are PHAT doors
[0:35:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's a door, all entry ways and covers are doors
[0:35:11] <cyniclymeric> my immediate reaction was yes and therefore you are wrong
[0:35:11] <+Reverend_Roscoe> FUNCTION VS FUNCTION @woolieversus
[0:35:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> woolie is clearly biased towards team wheel
[0:35:11] <+LastHazzerd> that's a barricade
[0:35:11] <+garsamm> openings are doors then
[0:35:12] <@CaptainPileDriver> Reggie shutup
[0:35:12] <+healnavi> YES IT IS
[0:35:13] <ZazzyDoesStuff> At this point it's what one could consider a door.
[0:35:15] <Dr_Mooose> that rock might be a wheel tho
[0:35:16] <Allen_33> Woolie vs philosophy
[0:35:17] <exnuart> FUNCTIONAL DOOR
[0:35:17] <RJay80> NEXT BIT
[0:35:18] <+hoenhime344> OMG that was soooo good rggie
[0:35:18] <+sandwich_jones> like you roll the wheel to make a door
[0:35:18] <@CaptainPileDriver> Reggie just shutup
[0:35:18] <leith_aziz> cohhHmm cohhHmm cohhHmm
[0:35:18] <%DreyfussFrost> A door is just a barrier you can open or close.
[0:35:18] <Vaunno> JESUS PUSHED THE ROCK DOOR Kapp
[0:35:19] <Teradyne87> Objection! Trapdoor spiders have rock doors
[0:35:20] <BandanaBishop> JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL
[0:35:20] <+ChancellorOfLights> platonic forms are stupid!
[0:35:20] <Karochi> a steering wheel is a wheel but a rock isn't a door OK
[0:35:21] <Aussie_Manny> Okay, this convo is making me laugh now. LUL
[0:35:22] <Darkdrill> oh wait it is
[0:35:25] <RyuuAoi> No Reggie keep going!
[0:35:26] <Treasure_Vault> If you roll something on a rock, is the rock a wheel?
[0:35:27] <alphalejandro> Jesus's cave door was a rock Kappa

[0:38:16] <Carlioo> i hope this question comes up again on the podcast
[0:38:16] <wandelmilch> Kirbys mouth = Door
[0:38:16] <+shamblingkrenshar> You can find wheel shaped doors but not door shaped wheels. Checkmate.
[0:38:18] <@Solidus_113> the demo has coop if you wanted to grab a 2nd controller
[0:38:19] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Oldest known Door and Wheel are both about 5000 years old with wheel winning by 200 years.
[0:38:30] <%Lion_kun> This whole thing better be uploaded to the channel
[0:38:33] <exnuart> is kirby a door or a wheel?

[0:39:04] <dds333a> All I know is that there are more doors than wheels in Kirby
[0:39:04] <+Sakom_Muwin> @exnuart He has a power where he turns into a wheel in some games

[0:47:06] <+ChancellorOfLights> I'm hoping in the main game
[0:47:06] <+AugiJr> No move list in the demo unfortunately.
[0:47:07] <huskarl_zap> CHAZ
[0:47:07] <nyacoo> Maybe only in single player
[0:47:11] <JacknZack27> You can slide attack too
[0:47:13] <BlackermanZX> guess its not on the demo
[0:47:14] <KingZaffy> You get it from Crouch + Attack > Attack
[0:47:15] <dan_g_v> didn't you unlock the movelist with the Smith at town?
[0:47:16] <OblivionSword1> probably in the full game
[0:47:16] <+BatGuano114> Crouch + A
[0:47:21] <TheAzureOracle> There's no move list this time, I suspect it's in the town or something
[0:47:29] <+AugiJr> I think if you stand right next to the enemy you do the rising, it works for the cutter ability.
[0:47:29] <Vaunno> guard and a
[0:47:30] <Aussie_Manny> ee-YAH! EH!
[0:47:31] <@Solidus_113> block attacks maybe

[0:55:44] <@Menitta> the base powers are much more simple but they do upgrade
[0:55:47] <%jepupu> You grind for additional skills in the full version probably
[0:55:51] <+DD_Boo> Perfect dodges iirc. and in the full game, upgradeable abilities

[0:56:13] <Aussie_Manny> ee-YAH! EH!
[0:56:14] <dante_suoh> Maybe because upgraded powers can some time get different moves

[1:29:46] <%SegaDSi> never forget the lightsaber
[1:29:48] <smilingseer> Those were some fun mixes!
[1:29:49] <Rojo_Hou> Rock Cutter even had the animal pals in a cameo
[1:29:49] <+sandwich_jones> loved the ice/cutter combo
[1:30:03] <KeroKamina> It was in Star Allie’s iirc
[1:30:03] <+sandwich_jones> or the one thats just darth mauls sword
[1:30:10] <+ChancellorOfLights> fire cutter for flame greatsword
[1:30:11] <Teradyne87> Atomic reconvergence. We shall all be part of a star again eventually
[1:30:15] <djblue_shift> ye ye ye ye
[1:30:15] <Ponroko> When Kirby started to reclaim life on this planet the humans were the first to go
[1:30:16] <$ggbhtg> Darth Maul, yep
[1:30:17] <majindusto> Kirby 64  Power Combo's  STILL have never been  topped
[1:30:17] <NBUsagi> Electric and Fire was just setting yourself on fire
[1:30:20] <+pectusumbra> fire and stone for volcano. fire and sword for a flaming sword
[1:30:21] <NBUsagi> Spike and Ice was super cool
[1:30:23] <%notsoy> electric + cutter I ebelieve
[1:30:27] <yet_another_brony> star allies did have a sort of combination thing goin on but not as much
[1:30:31] <exnuart> bomb + cutter for exploding shurikens
[1:30:34] <$ggbhtg> Bomb + Cutter = Shuriken Bomb
[1:30:39] <Greben> elec+ice
[1:30:44] <exnuart> @ggbhtg YEAAAA
[1:30:48] <Greben> refrigerator
[1:30:59] <enerkaizer> Megaman did that. you could combine forms in Megaman starforce 3
[1:30:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @WoolieWoolz Bomb + Cutter was literally broken
[1:31:00] <%notsoy> fire + cutter = fire sword which was just as useful but not as cool
[1:31:00] <dds333a> Squeak Squad also kinda had it, but they brought back the "multiple copy ability" storage thing
[1:31:07] <BlackermanZX> Starforce did it yeah
[1:31:08] <$ggbhtg> Yep, Ice + Elec for Fridge
[1:31:12] <dds333a> And item mixing
[1:31:17] <BlackermanZX> Also Battle Network 6
[1:31:21] <$ggbhtg> nope
[1:31:24] <$ggbhtg> had that one
[1:31:25] <exnuart> fire and ice was the worst
[1:31:29] <projecthazoid> rock + needle for the drill arm. but imma burning + cutter basic boy for that flaming sword
[1:31:32] <Rojo_Hou> I'm surprised we haven't seen something like this out of Kirby before. Mario 3d land happened ages ago and I'm getting big Mario 3d Land vibes from this
[1:31:32] <Necnill> God the movement is so unsettling
[1:31:42] <%Stormzcales_Lair> other two are ahead
[1:31:43] <%SegaDSi> nah this is half way
[1:31:44] <yet_another_brony> no theres more
[1:31:46] <+threamstream> no there's another section after this
[1:31:49] <smilingseer> Other two in next area
[1:32:00] <David_de_Bergerac> there's more level
[1:32:00] <NBUsagi> Im not bothered at all by Full Mouth mode, am i weird?
[1:32:03] <majindusto> Star Allies powers was fun...Bu it just wasn't  the same as 64
[1:32:05] <%LouieRouie> Did you forget the turtles?
[1:32:06] <exnuart> rock + bomb for the super dangerous screen clear dynamite
[1:32:07] <dds333a> time for SETUPS
[1:32:07] <slackerunchained> Fog Wall, up.
[1:32:08] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> this music is too joyous to not listen to while skipping through a sunny meadow high on shrooms
[1:32:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Bomb + Cutter = Exploding Shuriken that instantly travel across the screen and Stun lock targets before exploding
[1:32:09] <VJdarkworld> BOOM
[1:32:11] <twoto858> Lingering hitbox
[1:32:11] <smilingseer> Bomb shield a go
[1:32:13] <majindusto> *But
[1:32:24] <@Menitta> What's amazing is while Hal did have some 3D stuff like Blowout Blast and Air Ride, those barely touched the surface of 3D
[1:32:25] <%SegaDSi> Wait, since we can see where they spawn we can start the bomb chain
[1:32:25] <$ggbhtg> Bomberman 64 looking OD
[1:32:36] <@Menitta> this looks like they've been making 3D games for ages.
[1:32:44] <slackerunchained> Man, Dat poise...
[1:32:53] <BlackermanZX> Dee has million stabs huh
[1:32:54] <%holydeviant1> Can't wait for the new waifu to show up, since there's at LEAST one pergame
[1:32:56] <exnuart> level up abilities into boss abilities
[1:33:03] <+ChancellorOfLights> all the war paint themes makes me think that paint might be mind controlling
[1:33:12] <$ggbhtg> High five? LAME
[1:33:14] <exnuart> @holydeviant1 its a boss cat according to twitter
[1:33:16] <dds333a> @holydeviant1 how do you know Elf isn't female LUL
[1:33:19] <%SegaDSi> you never went left here
[1:33:20] <$ggbhtg> It's a high five now,. WEAAAK
[1:33:23] <Darkdrill> BOSS FULLMODE
[1:33:28] <smilingseer> Its a high five? Weak!!
[1:33:29] <%baka_sugoi> kiss
[1:33:30] <%kyh9> There will probably be super bosses that require juiced abilities
[1:33:31] <+agnetj> Is this the full game?
[1:33:32] <NBUsagi> Kiss your homies yo
[1:33:33] <TheProtomanBlues> I want the kiss one!
[1:33:34] <dds333a> @exnuart yeah, but she's a boss LUL

[1:33:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Give your homies a kiss goodnight
[1:33:39] <%AngryAsian5> Kissahomie
[1:33:40] <%kyh9> OR rather, your super-sword is the mini version of the boss
[1:33:43] <alphalejandro> It was like a french kiss heal
[1:33:45] <kentrix11> Kirby can't kiss the homies anymore F.
[1:33:45] <$ggbhtg> No one EVER expects the BUTTERFLY
[1:33:46] <exnuart> @dds333a bosses can be waifus

[1:34:00] <majindusto> They aren't  RED BUTTERFLY
[1:34:01] <David_de_Bergerac> left building
[1:34:05] <dds333a> @exnuart yeah, but he's talking about helper waifus

[1:34:55] <+yuribo26> That turtle had a nice tan
[1:34:57] <dds333a> @nbusagi and even that is handled with the same cute veneer as everything else

[1:42:52] <RyuuAoi> We didn't see Fighter Kirby.
[1:42:52] <Vaunno> oh monsters are coming back just you wait
[1:42:56] <@Solidus_113> we're getting double copy powers with this, so it's something
[1:43:00] <dds333a> @taco_salsaguy LUL LUL WutFace
[1:43:10] <Blank9> the trailers showed that you unlock more moves as you level up abilities
[1:43:14] <NBUsagi> The evolving your abilities is dope now
[1:43:16] <David_de_Bergerac> woolie you should really LP Robobot
[1:43:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Hey, Quebec, what the fuck is Bonhomme Carnaval???
[1:43:19] <David_de_Bergerac> somehow
[1:43:22] <slackerunchained> @Taco_Salsaguy Jehuty is no longer 'Naked'.
[1:43:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[1:43:23] <RyuuAoi> SMASH Kirby is real! Suplex Kirby is REAL
[1:43:24] <dds333a> lighting it in fire
[1:43:31] <rommlll> hammer tech has gotten only better
[1:43:33] <%solracc25> burn matches
[1:43:36] <%xjn_> @CappuccinoGuil He's like Youppi but for winter
[1:43:37] <+sandwich_jones> what if kirby ate poo
[1:43:42] <SomariMan> I think the blocking and slow-mo dodge will add to the smaller movesets.
[1:43:43] <@Menitta> It was interesting playing Kirby's Adventure for the first time recently. There's copy abilities that later became moves for others. Like Freeze became the running attack for ice. It's neat
[1:43:48] <rommlll> kirby the loathful dung eater
[1:43:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @xjn_ he's like WHAT?!
[1:43:50] <%SegaDSi> SegaDSi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! So Is this the 1st time that Kirby directly gains powers from inanimate objects? Aside form the power orbs and Triple Deluxe seed. I think thats the reason for the Mouth
[1:43:50] <@Solidus_113> fighter kirby has motion inputs
[1:44:07] <rommlll> yeeee
[1:44:10] <slackerunchained> @sandwich_jones "The loathsome Dung-Eater..."

[1:44:49] <$ggbhtg> I've been gone for a minute, so here's a bit of bit support alongside the other item description I know from the demo: "Lightron Works Sign - The Lightron Works Company was a massive corporation that invested in research and development within all kinds of fields: electro, bio, astro, and more! Lightron eventually split up, giving rise to many rival companies and countless heated corporate battles." cheer533
[1:44:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> We ff6 Boiz now?
[1:44:57] <slackerunchained> I can't wait for the guys to hit the Veldt in FF6 and just lose the next 6 months there collecting all of the abilities... Like I did.

[1:46:11] <+wmeldrum> pretty good

[1:46:32] <+sandwich_jones> penguin sounds like hes in the sopranos
[1:46:34] <ggbhtg> What I READ was the AMC theatres price hike
[1:46:35] <pirateofpie> It is really good
[1:46:35] <majindusto> Reggie  heard WRONG INFO
[1:46:37] <rinaldiaar> Please Robbie
[1:46:38] <+toomuchsnarf> think AMC is doing that
[1:46:39] <David_de_Bergerac> great experiment
[1:46:39] <+Ancopro> wow what an experiment
[1:46:40] <RyuuAoi> AMC pricing was BS
[1:46:40] <alphalejandro> Best Batmobile since the Tumbler
[1:46:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Yarrrr
[1:46:48] <+UKOrigin> Wat, its incredible
[1:46:48] <%illicitdonut> It's pretty good, just a bit long. I've got my nitpicks but overall a good Batman movie.
[1:46:49] <HarshNerf> peepoHappy the high seas
[1:46:59] <ggbhtg> AMC did a price hike for this, and Spiderman too, since they were on the cusp of death
[1:46:59] <+sandwich_jones> superhero tax so we can fund real movies
[1:47:00] <AlphaRayAllen> Will I be taught discipline?
[1:47:01] <CappuccinoGuil> AMC: We're increasing our prices! Me: Yaaaarrr made a BIG mistake
[1:47:01] <RyuuAoi> THANK YOU REGGIE
[1:47:02] <%sssoapy> What's the usual price? It's already 25 in BC

[1:47:39] <HarshNerf> there's an animated batman movie every year
[1:47:44] <dds333a> Quite overhyped
[1:47:49] <@CaptainPileDriver> the new batman movie was really good imo
[1:47:51] <+EdgySalad> I watched Batman and paid for my friend's ticket. $9 USD
[1:47:52] <alphalejandro> Hey, BATffleck didn't get a chance
[1:47:54] <rommlll> been told new batty goes hard, but could use at least one joke
[1:47:55] <+UKOrigin> Its super noir
[1:47:56] <+sandwich_jones> batman has always been boring
[1:48:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Which Batman was the one that was yelling at people? Like the actor was
[1:48:15] <+toomuchsnarf> yeah Batman was soild

[1:49:43] <@Solidus_113> and that's the cheapest model
[1:49:44] <GHouseduivel> The Top Tier is $650 USD
[1:49:45] <BlackermanZX> heard he deck is pretty good
[1:49:46] <%xerotwo> almost anything
[1:49:47] <Vaunno> igpu laptop at 60% price
[1:49:47] <HarshNerf> no laptops only steam deck
[1:49:54] <+pectusumbra> The steam deck is apparently good and also a great emulation machine
[1:49:56] <Gorgs7> Joker was terrible. it was premised on someone with mental issues. The Joker has always been about the premise that anyone can go full supervillain with a bad day
[1:49:56] <+Jiggisnipe> oh yea chat, Itch dot io is doing a Bundle for Ukraine for $10 of roughly 1000 games such as ZeroRanger, Celeste, CrossCode, Baba Is You, etc.

[1:50:07] <ExpressNode> Just read some weird news that Michael Pachter says that PS will not exist in the next decade. Doesn't this guy get wrong predictions most of the time?
[1:50:09] <+ChancellorOfLights> allegedly you can use it for VR
[1:50:10] <+vaderxyz1970> Switch runs AMAZING on that thing
[1:50:10] <@Menitta> ah steam deck
[1:50:13] <badugidugi> @Menitta steam deck

[1:50:18] <exnuart> strive doesnt work on it
[1:50:20] <%xerotwo> Jebaited
[1:50:23] <%Juriasu> I kinda wish steam deck used windows out of the box so compatibility wasn't up in the air for every game
[1:50:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:50:28] <+toomuchsnarf> seen KOFXV runs good on it

[1:50:36] <BlackermanZX> Portable Melty Blood sets lets gooo
[1:50:40] <Qu1ckyyy> You can play Switch games better on the Steam deck than on the Switch itself.
[1:50:40] <rommlll> steam deck being out is good, but it's a long way til it becomes perfect
[1:50:44] <%shadepman> woolieTRASH
[1:50:49] <@Menitta> I already upgraded all my tech, even had to replace my Switch, so I'm passing on the steam deck
[1:50:51] <bigshedman> @Gorgs7 Well haven't there been a fucking million interpretations of the Joker in comics and other media? Why adhere to one version so strictly?

[2:20:24] <exnuart> its foreign to japan
[2:20:25] <%DreyfussFrost> Janicon Kefka still the best.  Shoutouts to that guy.
[2:20:37] <BlackermanZX> i would combine that outfit with the green hair
[2:20:42] <KeiPrime> maybe she's born with it
[2:20:48] <%Shad0wTag> Duodecim is better to look at
[2:20:55] <djblue_shift> nomura's spin on amano's art were great
[2:20:59] <Teradyne87> Tina Bradford sounds like a Resident Evil character name
[2:21:04] <+healnavi> Cyan is Cayenne
[2:21:14] <KeiPrime> kai en
[2:21:18] <badugidugi> Kaien
[2:21:19] <KeiPrime> yehh
[2:21:28] <+healnavi> yeah, but also Cayenne like the pepper
[2:21:30] <%DreyfussFrost> Kaien, yeah
[2:21:36] <Teradyne87> @healnavi Wouldn't you like to be a pepper, too?
[2:21:39] <badugidugi> yeah I named him Cayenne in my game
[2:21:40] <KeiPrime> spicy
[2:21:42] <VioletRosefall> ye there is a few
[2:21:45] <%Rixstarian> @woolieversus How much Veldt hunting did you end up doing?
[2:21:49] <+Jiggisnipe> Cayenne didn't fit I believe so it got shortened
[2:21:54] <CarrotWhisky> That water surface texture is hypnotizing.
[2:22:00] <KeiPrime> yeah snes character limits
[2:22:14] <RyuuAoi> Salt and Peppers here!
[2:22:15] <GHouseduivel> Quick hit up the English dictionary and pick words
[2:22:16] <+pectusumbra> Yes, and originally Sabin was Mash, because Edgar & Mash, the english meal
[2:22:23] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[2:22:24] <+Jiggisnipe> SourPls
[2:22:27] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[2:22:28] <KeiPrime> mr solt and mr peppor, chrono cross confirmed
[2:22:29] <%DreyfussFrost> 14 confirmed his name properly romanized is Kaien.
[2:22:32] <AdmiralButtloaf> kaien
[2:22:38] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Hello, my name is Blue Letters
[2:22:39] <+anoldtoilet> kaien makes a lot of sense.
[2:22:47] <KeiPrime> stray cat is dope
[2:22:56] <+Jiggisnipe> Kaien would have fit too which is funny
[2:22:58] <SunjammerIV> bomb, ghost, and stray cat are good for now
[2:23:07] <+pectusumbra> you're solid woolie
[2:23:18] <+pectusumbra> Stray Cat is that crazy busted one
[2:23:21] <AdmiralButtloaf> In FFXIV the former King of Doma is Lord Kaien
[2:23:21] <%Glock3bb> Nah, you're good for now.
[2:23:28] <+ParzAno> do enemies take their turn while you are selecting your move?
[2:23:30] <%DreyfussFrost> Stray Cat IS the busted one
[2:23:31] <alrobot2014> iirc this anguiform is a pretty good pickup do Gau later
[2:23:35] <GHouseduivel> @ParzAno Yes.
[2:23:42] <GHouseduivel> @ParzAno Its an active battle system
[2:23:51] <Explodincatz> stray cat is all u need
[2:23:58] <RyuuAoi> Whens Aquaman?
[2:24:02] <leith_aziz> pickyLurk
[2:24:03] <+ParzAno> @GHouseduivel interesting, is there a setting to pause when you are selecting your move?
[2:24:06] <+pectusumbra> I don't know/remember when you get nightshade
[2:24:08] <DerpioParty> I don't know about you, but that's how me and my friends do that when we travel through the gulf stream
[2:24:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I dont think its even a Big Daddy sized helmet
[2:24:15] <+pectusumbra> Yes
[2:24:18] <GHouseduivel> @ParzAno Do not believe so.
[2:24:22] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @parzano yes, it's on
[2:24:23] <+Jiggisnipe> I think the diving helmet is a submarine type thing
[2:24:31] <rommlll> best water level
[2:24:36] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I think they just take turns using it and hold their breath the rest of the time
[2:24:38] <+pectusumbra> For Later
[2:24:38] <RyuuAoi> NOT A WHEEL. A DOOR
[2:24:38] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @parzano if you are in a submenu, the attacks stop
[2:24:41] <%Juriasu> l a t e r
[2:24:44] <leith_aziz> Door or Wheel? cohhO
[2:24:45] <%townzzzzz> maybe Kappa
[2:24:52] <linSP> yeah I mean it’s not even a full suit either
[2:24:52] <+Mrbaconator> a DOOR you say
[2:24:57] <Teradyne87> Always go right
[2:25:07] <+ParzAno> @Reverend_Roscoe submenu? like a attack menu within a attack menu?
[2:25:10] <SunjammerIV> bomb is better against big groups
[2:25:18] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie made a guide for his OC?
[2:25:29] <+pectusumbra> @Reverend_Roscoe like choosing magic, items, or things like different rages
[2:25:41] <%kyh9> Taskmaster
[2:25:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:25:42] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @parzano after selecting attack, item, or whatever then the game pauses
[2:25:48] <%kyh9> Task master learning how to be worthy from THOR
[2:25:49] <alrobot2014> the boy can shoot lasers
[2:25:50] <RyuuAoi> We all float down here
[2:26:00] <BlackermanZX> Gau is just built different
[2:26:01] <Teradyne87> Gau can also shoot a Magitek laser
[2:26:19] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @parzano but on the main menu where you select attack, skill, item, etc the atb bars fill and the enemies can attack
[2:26:34] <+ParzAno> does this remake mess anything up, like translation or something like that?
[2:26:37] <+pectusumbra> That's an EO skill
[2:26:41] <RyuuAoi> Those strings, Woolie!
[2:26:50] <mothdude> Should be the same as the GBA translation, right?
[2:26:50] <+ParzAno> seems like most of these remakes slip up on something?
[2:26:56] <NickHatesSnow> @teradyne87 Literally the first thing woolie did with him last time
[2:26:58] <pirateofpie> Don't know if it's just me, but that water animation was nuts
[2:27:01] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @parzano general consensus is these are pretty good
[2:27:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> woah what is this? I missed this trench
[2:27:11] <+ParzAno> @Reverend_Roscoe sweet!
[2:27:12] <AbnormalVoid> it might be coded different now, since it was fully remade
[2:27:18] <AbnormalVoid> and that system sucked balls
[2:27:23] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Or like the stuff in it dang!
[2:27:32] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[2:27:38] <+anoldtoilet> @ParzAno opera scene ive heard is a little weird. but its probably fine
[2:27:45] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Iirc it goes in order of when you encountered them?
[2:27:48] <%DreyfussFrost> @parzano The first menu that pops up when a character is ready doesn't pause, but the ATB pauses when you select one of those until you finish choosing a target.  Animations will still play, but their turn timers are frozen once you're choosing a spell/item/target.
[2:27:55] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @parzano there are actually a few quality of life changes that make the game a little more friendly
[2:27:55] <@SoushinSen> 1 pack , 2 pack, 3 pack, 4. 4 pack, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1/. You're pac, he's pac, no pacs, none
[2:28:12] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Good to give whoever you want to tank
[2:28:15] <badugidugi> rip 2pac
[2:28:21] <+ParzAno> @DreyfussFrost gotcha! thanks for the explanation!
[2:28:26] <+Mrbaconator> 2pac cap22PepeHands
[2:28:31] <RyuuAoi> @jessie_lockhart YOSHI
[2:28:45] <+anoldtoilet> what about X-pac

[2:28:58] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @ryuuaoi pieSmug
[2:29:01] <%Glock3bb> Nah, all the same.
[2:29:02] <+Jiggisnipe> perhaps
[2:29:20] <rommlll> welcome to progress
[2:29:23] <+Proxzo> look at that water
[2:29:29] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:29:30] <RyuuAoi> @jessie_lockhart B)
[2:29:45] <%DreyfussFrost> @parzano Unfortunately since GBA they all use the flatter translation, but aside from that this version is perfectly fine and has several gameplay improvements.  If you want the definitive experience just wait for the inevitable Woolsey mod.
[2:29:50] <%BlueJoneleth> is that an ikea store that sells nike shoes?
[2:29:57] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Where’s the shoe store. Need those new Air Sabin/
[2:30:04] <+Jessie_Lockhart> *Sabins
[2:30:08] <+anoldtoilet> frankly i like this translation a lot more
[2:30:18] <+ParzAno> @DreyfussFrost whats a woolsey mod? also i will def check it out, i just dont have the funds haha
[2:30:34] <Aeonknight_87> woolsey was the original translator

[2:51:34] <alrobot2014> it stacks when you have 2
[2:51:38] <%Glock3bb> Little with one, lot with two, but doesn't reflect on stats.
[2:51:46] <Teradyne87> 25% magic damage with on, 50% increase with two
[2:52:10] <rommlll> cyan sabin and edgar as leads
[2:52:11] <slackerunchained> I like to imagine them saying "Ellipses."

[2:59:54] <Aussie_Manny> Ahh, this is bringing the memories back now. I loved the FFVI crew.
[3:00:01] <agsiar2> i don't like berserk-like abilities. which is why i never played a certain hairy character
[3:00:09] <agsiar2> which isn't banon
[3:00:12] <Teradyne87> Gau be like "Clang clang clang, I'm Magitek Armor!"

[3:22:49] <Teradyne87> Yes 3
[3:22:52] <+Jessie_Lockhart> You can have 4 people lol
[3:22:54] <iambqb> Taking 3 is the right call, Reggie is doing his job here
[3:22:55] <+Dakuu75> Lol
[3:22:56] <KericInfinitum> take Celes too the Locke thing has more stuff if Celes is there
[3:22:59] <%BlueJoneleth> check their equipment lol
[3:23:00] <+aBlueWizard> take 4, take celes.
[3:23:05] <BigManLugan> its almost like Reggie has the script
[3:23:06] <Teradyne87> There is a point to taking 3 here
[3:23:06] <Aeonknight_87> @Jessie_Lockhart if you have 3 it leaves a spot for da boi
[3:23:06] <@SoushinSen> team triple S. Simp, Simp2, Sigma
[3:23:09] <DerpioParty> Party of fouuurrrr
[3:23:10] <speximillian> Take 3, get sick ninja
[3:23:11] <agsiar2> ceeeeeleeees
[3:23:13] <+pectusumbra> Do take the 4th
[3:23:14] <agsiar2> you'll need heals
[3:23:17] <agsiar2> and a hot girl
[3:23:21] <slackerunchained> Didja ever wonder just how ghosts got to the afterlife before trains were invented? :\
[3:23:23] <GHouseduivel> Asspains
[3:23:26] <AbnormalVoid> TAKE FOUR
[3:23:27] <DerpioParty> You can have foouuur
[3:23:33] <rommlll> CUNO CAN TAKE THEM!
[3:23:34] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @aeonknight_87 really? He joins you? I didnt know that
[3:23:38] <iambqb> Does Gau even know where he is right now?
[3:23:40] <OblivionSword1> chat trust in Reggie
[3:23:42] <AbnormalVoid> wait, unless you want shadow
[3:23:44] <alrobot2014> there's a reason for only taking 3
[3:23:47] <Aeonknight_87> @Jessie_Lockhart he's in the next town
[3:23:50] <KobeTeeth90> i trust in reggie
[3:23:51] <Aussie_Manny> Like a saiyan pod. lol
[3:23:51] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Let Reggie be the Sherpa
[3:23:51] <%MrP33Ps> Chat needs to chill
[3:23:55] <GHouseduivel> Stanky 🎷🎷
[3:23:59] <NickHatesSnow> I trust Reggie, I don't know why 3 but Im curious
[3:24:02] <agsiar2> i trusted reggue in dokapon, then lost my bet...
[3:24:05] <agsiar2> *reggie
[3:24:09] <Aeonknight_87> @NickHatesSnow ninjas
[3:24:11] <Th3rd3> Banon: What happen? I drank too much and pass out
[3:24:11] <agsiar2> twice
[3:24:14] <+Beepkitty> i trust in reggie
[3:24:17] <berasite> LUL
[3:24:18] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @aeonknight_87 oh i know hea there, I just didnt know he can join you
[3:24:26] <Teradyne87> @agsiar2 Reggie didn't have a script handy for Dokapon
[3:24:30] <AthenaAegis> Bannon Nolte Kappa
[3:24:32] <NickHatesSnow> @agsiar2 That's your fault for not trusting minh
[3:24:37] <alphalejandro> Well, Celes tho
[3:24:37] <slackerunchained> Banon: Slowly getting steadily drunker as the plot trundles on.
[3:24:43] <@SoushinSen> @agsiar2 The ntrust in me who trusts in Reggie
[3:24:51] <KericInfinitum> there is stuff to miss with celes
[3:25:23] <+healnavi> Woolie has to pick between very small amounts of Celes content or mystery content
[3:25:23] <+pectusumbra> locke with sandles would be good
[3:25:29] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Tbh I think Celes is better to have anyway. There’s reasons beyond lore.
[3:25:37] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Yeah there is an extra thing with Celes, but it's not the end of the world if they miss it
[3:25:37] <GHouseduivel> I fucking love the 🎷🎷
[3:25:45] <+pectusumbra> I would take Celes here as well just for the magic backup
[3:25:55] <Casivia> uhnSax
[3:26:00] <+pectusumbra> That said, do have to put trust in Reggie
[3:26:14] <ireliaismaiwaifu> sandals is better
[3:26:34] <AthenaAegis> Being able to pull the "fuck all magic" card is great with Celes
[3:26:52] <+pectusumbra> I mean in a worst case woolie can always go back and pick her up
[3:27:05] <Aeonknight_87> and you can just hold Circle to sprint anyway
[3:27:07] <+Jessie_Lockhart> jupiterGasm 🎷
[3:27:20] <+aBlueWizard> where is he going?
[3:27:22] <Aussie_Manny> wifiKrump
[3:27:30] <Th3rd3> Atatatatatata
[3:27:34] <alrobot2014> yep
[3:27:38] <+aBlueWizard> yes
[3:27:39] <%Glock3bb> You don't have to go through the mines.
[3:27:47] <alrobot2014> can finally explore narshe
[3:27:49] <CappuccinoGuil> Didn't the town hate Terra? so I'd think so, yeah
[3:27:59] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Hit up those shops
[3:28:14] <haisho> there was the front door
[3:28:19] <%sssoapy> go back to the house
[3:28:19] <alrobot2014> the front door of the house
[3:28:19] <+Jessie_Lockhart> There was a front door to that house, but lets take the scenic route
[3:28:21] <+aBlueWizard> leave the front door
[3:28:23] <%Glock3bb> Front door of house.
[3:28:42] <iambqb> I actually think there is something you can see in the cave if memory serves, but it's not like vital plot stuff
[3:28:45] <Th3rd3> Ymir would be a good pet...
[3:29:02] <Quetzacotlchu> ayyyy the pixel remaster
[3:29:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus I think you have Sabin in the back row
[3:29:15] <alrobot2014> @iambqb I think that's on the next Narshe visit
[3:29:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:29:28] <alrobot2014> @shinobiphoenix that's intentional
[3:29:30] <%BestTeaMaker> @ShinobiPhoenix he's fine in the back row
[3:29:35] <Quetzacotlchu> they really went hard for narshe's music in this
[3:29:47] <Teradyne87> "So I was spelunking, minding my own business, when some dick in a jumpsuit threw a wrench at me!"
[3:29:51] <+Jessie_Lockhart> They went hard for all the music really
[3:29:55] <OblivionSword1> good money
[3:29:55] <Quetzacotlchu> true
[3:30:01] <alrobot2014> correct iirc blitz all count as magic
[3:30:12] <%BestTeaMaker> is celes not in the party?
[3:30:13] <slackerunchained> @Teradyne87 If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!
[3:30:15] <CappuccinoGuil> maaaaaaaan someone said "the difference between Caelid and Brazil is that Caelid actually exists"
[3:30:22] <Aussie_Manny> Big ↗️
[3:30:22] <GHouseduivel> +10 Magic Evasion
[3:30:34] <Aussie_Manny> The Crime Knife. 🔪
[3:30:34] <Teradyne87> @slackerunchained If you can dodge a ball, you can dodge child support payments
[3:30:35] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Mug!
[3:30:36] <majindusto> PlayStation State of Play happening  soon so i will be having  to dip out.
[3:30:37] <CappuccinoGuil> So never take this off, got it
[3:30:46] <alphalejandro> Locke with the shank crimes
[3:30:50] <majindusto> GOOD ITEM
[3:30:55] <+HeroSolaire> So chat you guys think this remastere is the definitive edition?
[3:30:55] <Quetzacotlchu> locked chest but you have locke in your party smh
[3:30:57] <GxthApology> BIG ITEM
[3:30:58] <+HeroSolaire> is the translation good?
[3:31:00] <haisho> and there's your solution to magic in case Celes isn't with you
[3:31:07] <Drusain> Most spells
[3:31:07] <Teradyne87> Almost all
[3:31:07] <%Glock3bb> Yep!
[3:31:07] <@SoushinSen> Attack + Treasure hunt
[3:31:10] <+anoldtoilet> ALSO HEALS
[3:31:12] <BigManLugan> reflects heals as well
[3:31:18] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yes
[3:31:18] <starwars90001> Reflects support Too.
[3:31:18] <%holydeviant1> Warning: Reflects ALL magic
[3:31:18] <+healnavi> that includes cure
[3:31:23] <%tempestzephyr> also white magic
[3:31:34] <BigManLugan> potions are safe
[3:31:36] <+Jessie_Lockhart> But not items
[3:31:38] <KeiPrime> no one cast cure at the moment so its fien
[3:31:41] <%xjn_> woolieKICKDAD
[3:31:44] <OblivionSword1> including white magic aka cure
[3:31:46] <%LouieRouie> Is it?
[3:32:04] <+pectusumbra> It's an attack
[3:32:06] <Teradyne87> Also sometimes enemies throw attack magic of an element they are immune to/ absorb. Something to note
[3:32:06] <ireliaismaiwaifu> is the sword better than the air knife?
[3:32:08] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Reflect on tank maybe?
[3:32:12] <Quetzacotlchu> probably less strong from the back row
[3:32:24] <%Glock3bb> Depends what you're fighting.
[3:32:30] <+pectusumbra> THAT is for Locke
[3:32:34] <ireliaismaiwaifu> oh no
[3:32:51] <+pectusumbra> still one more chest
[3:32:53] <+skyshinecrusader> you can change for the fight youre in
[3:33:02] <Teradyne87> @pectusumbra Shit's locked
[3:33:18] <+RealThiele> Hyper wrist for that belt action
[3:33:37] <DXLelouch24> @SoushinSen Minh tell Woolie about the Celes story stuff
[3:33:39] <+pectusumbra> got ya.
[3:34:09] <%BestTeaMaker> i just don't know why they don't have 4 party members
[3:34:23] <%BlueJoneleth> @BestTeaMaker you'll see
[3:34:32] <haisho> it'll make sense
[3:34:41] <@SoushinSen> what celes story stuff?
[3:34:43] <+Jiggisnipe> yea dw there is a good reason
[3:34:47] <Teradyne87> Back row does not determine blitz damage as far as I know
[3:34:49] <@SoushinSen> if it's spoilers, don't say it
[3:34:51] <Aeonknight_87> magic based blitzes use magic stat, i'm pretty sure the physical ones use STR
[3:34:51] <SunjammerIV> sabin ends up as mostly a magical charqacter
[3:34:51] <alrobot2014> earrings are surprisingly good on him yes
[3:34:55] <+healnavi> FF6 is complicated and weird don't worry about it
[3:35:03] <%BlueJoneleth> Why is Sabin in the back row he's got the most HP lol
[3:35:03] <DXLelouch24> ask tea i dont remember been so long
[3:35:07] <%Glock3bb> No, earrings affect spells, not your magic stat.
[3:35:10] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @soushinsen she has an extra moment during the Locke scene
[3:35:11] <%BestTeaMaker> oh right
[3:35:14] <%BestTeaMaker> i forgot that character
[3:35:31] <ireliaismaiwaifu> give him double earring for the roleplay
[3:35:32] <+RealThiele> R.E.G unit getting a blue screen
[3:35:42] <+pectusumbra> This game is WEIRD, don't sweat it too much for now
[3:36:26] <Drusain> Earring is just straight up % boost to magic spell damage
[3:36:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[3:36:49] <iambqb> your city was just invaded by people in magitek armor though old man, it's been like a day
[3:36:49] <+healnavi> This game had stats that didn't even work on SNES, I don't think minmaxing matters too much.
[3:36:49] <Teradyne87> Consider it done
[3:37:02] <Th3rd3> 🎷 🎷 🎷
[3:37:03] <CyrusHalberd13> Consider it done… because it is!
[3:37:09] <+anoldtoilet> yeah lol did they finally fix those?

[3:38:02] <ireliaismaiwaifu> ohhh that's hot
[3:38:07] <alrobot2014> moonring blade does full damage from the back row
[3:38:11] <Teradyne87> Chain flail does full damage from back row, but does not allow the use of Runic
[3:38:20] <Aeonknight_87> @WoolieVersus Celes has to use a Sword or her Runic does not work.  Chain Flail will break her ability
[3:38:38] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Check descrip of Moonring
[3:38:43] <Teradyne87> Any sword
[3:38:44] <+anoldtoilet> no just any sword
[3:38:44] <+pectusumbra> No, she just has to use a sword
[3:38:48] <%Demoli_PT> only swords
[3:38:49] <Quetzacotlchu> what? no, she can use any sword
[3:38:54] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:39:03] <Aussie_Manny> Well i'll be double-dog damned
[3:39:05] <Quetzacotlchu> LUL
[3:39:07] <GHouseduivel> I SEENT IT
[3:39:11] <alrobot2014> chain flail isn't a sword though hence runic doesn't work

[3:39:44] <iambqb> this is a relic shop
[3:39:45] <%BlueJoneleth> it's a relic
[3:39:52] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> it's a releic
[3:39:57] <OblivionSword1> glove relic
[3:39:57] <Teradyne87> @haisho If a man needs a 4 drink lunch to make it through the workday, who are we to judge?
[3:40:07] <exnuart> cause its a glove
[3:40:08] <%sssoapy> look at the top left
[3:40:09] <+pectusumbra> the genji glove is also a glove
[3:40:11] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> relic*
[3:40:13] <dd44dostivei> genji glove is the same
[3:40:21] <ireliaismaiwaifu> sprint shoes shouldnt be a ring too
[3:40:24] <OblivionSword1> it's a glove relic which mean it can also dual wield weapons
[3:40:32] <iambqb> @BigCoffee It's a choice between that scene and the one Reggie is leading Woolie to, let Reggie be the guide
[3:40:41] <Drusain> Shell is magic damage

[3:54:11] <%Anaguma_no_Koe> get that drill woolie!
[3:54:16] <OblivionSword1> DRILL
[3:54:18] <+pectusumbra> Drill. BREAKER
[3:54:22] <Teradyne87> New tool: French Tickler
[3:54:25] <time_axis> doriru
[3:54:31] <alrobot2014> let your drill pierce the heavens
[3:54:32] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> drill also ignores row. it's so good
[3:54:46] <+pectusumbra> Drill is top tier. Literally you will probably use it forever
[3:54:54] <dd44dostivei> but tents...
[3:55:26] <Teradyne87> Oh, also of note: Edgar's Bio Blaster and Flash damage are determined by his Magic stat
[3:55:30] <+Xeno351> GUNDAM GAME
[3:55:31] <Shazbeaut> Mountains have desert underneath
[3:55:54] <+mechslayer71> how long is this game chat?
[3:56:06] <badugidugi> quick save really alleviates tent usage
[3:56:11] <+pectusumbra> @mechslayer71 Doing everything is probably like 40 hours
[3:56:21] <TukeArt> reason to use tents: each character has unique tent sprite
[3:56:24] <+mechslayer71> @pectusumbra thanks
[3:56:39] <Shazbeaut> Tents are more about alleviating the potion/ether chore
[3:56:42] <alrobot2014> the game was already easy by default but having stats actually work makes it easier
[3:56:47] <%sssoapy> monkaS
[3:56:49] <%Charronia> limesShy
[3:56:52] <@SoushinSen> i rarely used tents in all FF games anyways
[3:56:58] <slackerunchained> I
[3:56:59] <agsiar2> looooooool
[3:57:06] <+pectusumbra> @mechslayer71 Np. Note if you want to play this yourself you can cut the time as well if you just want to hit the end

[3:57:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:57:43] <Drusain> Ca you push her out of the way?
[3:57:45] <linSP> Run into them and the game will displace them
[3:57:46] <time_axis> maybe if you leave and re-enter the room her position will reset
[3:57:46] <cj_art> 18 years later
[3:57:46] <badugidugi> 40-50 seems about right for first walkthrough, finished PR in about 14 but I know the game by heart lol

[3:57:49] <%Demoli_PT> oh you don't have the right
[3:57:49] <+HavenlessWF> doing everything in this game is closer to 60+ hours, but just doing main story on a first playthrough will be 30-40h for most people

[4:16:11] <+pectusumbra> Her Preserved corpse in a crystal coffin basically
[4:16:20] <%Charronia> Necromancy?
[4:16:25] <%Glock3bb> Think like Mr. Freeze's wife.
[4:16:27] <haisho> Insistent terminology!

[4:17:02] <+pectusumbra> Funny you should mention THAT specifically
[4:17:04] <Talinu> You can't afford one.
[4:17:04] <dd44dostivei> idunno about leaving unconscious women with this guy
[4:17:08] <%holydeviant1> for god's sake, pheonix downs are for BEING UNCONSCIOUS not DEAD
[4:17:08] <%Glock3bb> Ask Aerith.
[4:17:11] <0ddeye> just sell some shit
[4:17:17] <Shazbeaut> That only works on knock downs. And zombies.
[4:17:18] <Teradyne87> Her soul is too far away from her body so phoenix down won't work
[4:17:23] <time_axis> once they board the train it's probably too late for phoenix downs
[4:17:33] <+SunsetLaw> have they watched the state of play?
[4:17:45] <NickHatesSnow> @time_axis that's why you need to learn to suplex
[4:17:49] <Teradyne87> Not a ghost. A corpse. They're different
[4:17:51] <Quetzacotlchu> a raaaaspberry beret
[4:17:53] <KyberNasse> Phoenix Down is a magic defibrillator
[4:18:06] <demiiluna> Phoenix Downs only work on unconsciousness, right. Like the thing that happens to you when you get hit with the spell DEATH.
[4:18:09] <+pectusumbra> @SunsetLaw No, LP recording right now
[4:18:09] <+Jessie_Lockhart> He’s got all these heating lamps and it smells awful

[4:19:47] <alrobot2014> funny you mention that because you can do that in ff9
[4:19:48] <%Charronia> State-sponsored profiteering

[4:20:43] <+Jessie_Lockhart> You have a bunch of hats you can sell
[4:20:44] <@SoushinSen> Shadow, if you work for me, I got connection, you'll be well-known within the Figaro empire
[4:20:48] <LookIHaveaUsername> this song is metal
[4:20:59] <speximillian> Why sell your weapons when you could have Shadow throw them away for damage?
[4:21:13] <+Zappaslave> LOL!
[4:21:15] <+Zappaslave> Spex
[4:21:26] <Teradyne87> Go fight then!
[4:21:29] <+pectusumbra> I'd hold them
[4:21:40] <Teradyne87> Money grows on trees, you just have to murder them!
[4:21:44] <BlackermanZX> watch them hire shadow and then dip on the first fight
[4:21:59] <Teradyne87> @BlackermanZX That would be gold
[4:22:04] <+pectusumbra> woolie will save for sure
[4:22:06] <badugidugi> @BlackermanZX oh man hahaha
[4:22:07] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Would love it if as soon as Woolie pays Shadow, Shadow leaves after the first battle
[4:22:13] <+BloomingVillain> Ah, the classic item: Tinntinabulum.
[4:22:17] <+pectusumbra> I mean perfect chance to test your new tools!
[4:22:18] <alrobot2014> that'd be hilarious
[4:22:22] <+Jessie_Lockhart> “Thanks for the money suckers!”
[4:22:23] <Teradyne87> Like 4-5 fights tops
[4:22:29] <Drusain> menu selling is also time but sure
[4:22:34] <alrobot2014> when I hired him he left on me when I walked into the woods
[4:22:37] <DoctorMulholland> DO DO DOODOODOOOOO
[4:22:43] <demiiluna> I absolutely support quicksaving after every battle if they get Shadow so he doesn't roll that 1/16 chance of peacing out.
[4:22:51] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Its fine
[4:23:00] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It’ll take a few fights
[4:23:08] <@Solidus_113> when's automaton queen
[4:23:25] <%LouieRouie> What were you thinking of?
[4:23:34] <LookIHaveaUsername> it's weird seeing diagonal walking on the overworld
[4:23:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Rock beeeeeees
[4:24:10] <speximillian> If it's Gold, it must be worth a lot
[4:24:15] <Teradyne87> Suplex this kudzu
[4:24:21] <demiiluna> that can MISS?
[4:24:30] <Shazbeaut> Ropes are a nono, train is a yes
[4:24:34] <Drusain> it's flying
[4:24:40] <+Zappaslave> Less 'miss' more like set to a status that prevents it
[4:24:45] <+pectusumbra> cures petrification
[4:24:46] <Teradyne87> Cures petrification
[4:24:47] <@Solidus_113> petrification IIRC
[4:24:48] <speximillian> Gold Needle is Petrify cure
[4:24:49] <+Zappaslave> Flying? I thought it was Heavy
[4:25:09] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> alright Shadow get your ass in here
[4:25:12] <MaoujiProd> Always loved how Sabin had those motions you had to input.
[4:25:18] <speximillian> Watch Shadow leave after 2 fights
[4:25:20] <+pectusumbra> Make sure to SAVE
[4:25:26] <demiiluna> Save OFTEN.
[4:25:38] <%solracc25> buy shadow
[4:25:39] <alrobot2014> the random leaving still applies
[4:25:44] <demiiluna> 1/16 chance.
[4:25:45] <KobeTeeth90> Rotate ur Saves
[4:25:57] <BlackermanZX> rotate like a madman
[4:26:07] <%Charronia> Dude negotiated a good contract for himself
[4:26:09] <Teradyne87> He won't
[4:26:09] <alrobot2014> I got fucked over by him on my first run
[4:26:15] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Now its after 5 battles pieSmug
[4:26:15] <+pectusumbra> He doesn't steal your stuff, but he will randomly dip
[4:26:28] <speximillian> He'll leave your party for a nickel!
[4:26:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:26:30] <Darkdrill> LUL
[4:26:40] <Quetzacotlchu> just save every few steps
[4:26:44] <%RyTYoung> doodStare
[4:26:48] <PMAvers> Shadow's just going to bail and split the cash with Frog.
[4:26:56] <majindusto> "JOKER LAUGHING"
[4:26:58] <%Anaguma_no_Koe> LUL
[4:27:04] <shiny_prinny> 1/16 is HUGE to rpg players
[4:27:05] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Iirc he leaves just after a battle ends?
[4:27:05] <+pectusumbra> Yes
[4:27:10] <+Jiggisnipe> yep
[4:27:11] <%TheLemuroid> He absolutely did
[4:27:12] <OblivionSword1> at least gives him his kunai
[4:27:14] <BlackermanZX> yes
[4:27:15] <Teradyne87> If he dips, he'll unequip
[4:27:15] <%LouieRouie> He did
[4:27:15] <%holydeviant1> "WHY ARE YOU LEAVING" "YOU GAVE ME NOTHING TO USE" "BECAUSE YOU'D STEAL IT"
[4:27:17] <%Koopardon> He left his shit behind, can confirm
[4:27:20] <speximillian> He *does* unequip when leaving in this version
[4:27:23] <+Jessie_Lockhart> He did
[4:27:23] <Talinu> kunai?
[4:27:25] <speximillian> But he'll still leave
[4:27:27] <+Jiggisnipe> @holydeviant1 LUL
[4:27:31] <badugidugi> with his shurikens !
[4:27:39] <+pectusumbra> You can equip him normally and he'll give your stuff back after he leaves
[4:27:45] <+Jessie_Lockhart> He sure is
[4:27:53] <%TheLemuroid> He can keep his kunai
[4:27:56] <alrobot2014> pretty sure it's still 1 in 16
[4:28:01] <Lenanu591> I think you get cutscenes if you sleep at an inn with him
[4:28:06] <Drusain> Fun Fact! In the SNES version Shadow could leave in a 1-man party and game over you
[4:28:14] <speximillian> If you want to steal more pies, Shadow can use the Theif Knife
[4:28:20] <Quetzacotlchu> thought cutscenes weren't until WOR
[4:28:21] <Explodincatz> u kinda did
[4:28:23] <%holydeviant1> watch him leave battle ONE
[4:28:35] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie, Dokapon is forever, you can't escape
[4:28:41] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @holydeviant1 thats what I said gdqCheer
[4:28:54] <majindusto> Looks like DOKAPON  is back on the menu boys!!!
[4:29:07] <SilverFaustX> has woolie seen the sony direct?
[4:29:23] <BlackermanZX> he will watch it later most likely
[4:29:25] <+Jiggisnipe> naw they were playing ff6
[4:29:26] <alrobot2014> you can turn on cursor memory if you want it to stay
[4:29:43] <+Jiggisnipe> he'll catch a cliff notes cuz he doesn't like shows like that
[4:29:49] <TukeArt> you can set cursor memory on on configuration, if you want it to remember shuriken
[4:29:51] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I believe if you sort shurikens will go to top
[4:29:53] <shiny_prinny> i forgot flash did damage
[4:30:05] <speximillian> Flash is great. better damage than crossbow AND it blinds, AND blind actually works in this version.
[4:30:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Flash hurts their eyeballs. Psychic damage
[4:30:48] <Teradyne87> Can't suplex flying enemies
[4:30:49] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Quick nap for Edgar
[4:31:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> how has Sabin not learned his other Blitzes yet?
[4:31:36] <speximillian> Ninja Gear: A better Mythril Vest but only Ninjas like Locke and Gau can use it
[4:31:42] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Time to spend more money
[4:31:47] <badugidugi> @ShinobiPhoenix level based
[4:31:48] <alrobot2014> isn't blitz level gated?
[4:31:54] <Teradyne87> @ShinobiPhoenix I think they're learned at certain levels
[4:31:57] <+pectusumbra> yes blitz needs levels
[4:32:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I know, but I can't believe he hasn't learned any
[4:32:13] <Th3rd3> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[4:32:13] <badugidugi> next one is soon :)
[4:32:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like there one particular one that I had already by this point
[4:32:32] <+pectusumbra> @ShinobiPhoenix It's still really early. This is about the time you'd normally get the next one on the way to get terra
[4:32:35] <speximillian> next Blitz is at level 15
[4:32:40] <badugidugi> yep 15
[4:32:48] <alrobot2014> so really soon
[4:33:04] <speximillian> time to grind chances for Shadow to leave
[4:33:11] <+Jessie_Lockhart> ^
[4:33:17] <Teradyne87> Send Tem to Colleg Woolie
[4:33:31] <Th3rd3> ask Shadow for a loan TPFufun
[4:33:31] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[4:33:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> The next blitz is great i love it
[4:34:08] <KericInfinitum> this is the reason I don't go for shadow at this point in the game
[4:34:09] <+Jessie_Lockhart> You’re not wrong
[4:34:12] <speximillian> I mean, you earn 3000 in like 5-6 battles so you can just go line his pockets again
[4:34:16] <%holydeviant1> I came back in and for a second I thought Shadow had left because h actually blended in
[4:34:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @kericinfinitum is it every time you see him you gotta pay or does he eventually stay?
[4:34:47] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Just save often
[4:35:06] <+Jessie_Lockhart> He aint leaving until we say so
[4:35:14] <speximillian> @SuckerPunchSyd Pay him every time. And pay for his shurikens and other weapons he throws away.
[4:35:16] <KericInfinitum> you have to pay every time until a certain point in the game
[4:35:27] <badugidugi> catJAM
[4:35:27] <Teradyne87> No Woolie, not here. Not yet
[4:35:28] <speximillian> Yoooo catJAM

[4:35:46] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> No go back I need more of that Zozo remix
[4:35:54] <speximillian> Woolie crossed the tracks, looked around, and backed down immediately
[4:36:08] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Theres time folks. We’ll get to it soon enough.
[4:36:12] <Teradyne87> "Roll 'em up"
[4:36:22] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @speximillian thats what you do in Zozo
[4:36:35] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Only fools cross those tracks into Zozo
[4:36:50] <+Jiggisnipe> doesn't an npc tell you about Zozo? I'd leave too LUL
[4:36:54] <speximillian> Zozo is the bad part of town. The ENTIRE bad part of town.
[4:37:18] <Teradyne87> @speximillian Like Hoboken
[4:37:26] <+Zappaslave> The wrong side of the tracks. The underside
[4:37:29] <Teradyne87> jk
[4:37:36] <+Jessie_Lockhart> “You’ll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.”
[4:37:37] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:37:40] <speximillian> Zozo is the true EverHood.
[4:37:45] <rommlll> o hey, shadow's back

[4:38:43] <+Jiggisnipe> quick saves
[4:38:48] <rommlll> LUL
[4:39:00] <alrobot2014> should be the first page on steam community for the text mod @narratorway
[4:39:11] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Every fight is filling me with dread. I don't want Shadow to leave
[4:39:13] <+Jiggisnipe> gj
[4:39:26] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:39:29] <Teradyne87> Neuron Activated
[4:39:36] <rommlll> mom, when's shadow coming back?
[4:39:37] <majindusto> HE FORGOT LUL
[4:39:39] <+Jiggisnipe> YES
[4:39:41] <shiny_prinny> LUL
[4:39:42] <%sssoapy> I mean you do you
[4:39:42] <%solracc25> save scum it
[4:39:47] <Teradyne87> It's that or find and pay him again
[4:39:53] <alrobot2014> I still live in fear
[4:39:53] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Do it
[4:40:06] <alrobot2014> he left my ass in 5 minutes flat
[4:40:27] <rommlll> he took my money, hung out a bit, and dippe
[4:40:33] <speximillian> I mean, you need more money, give that cool Thief Knife to Shadow and he'll steal stuff like Locke when he attacks
[4:40:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:40:50] <%Glock3bb> He comes and goes like the wind, Woolie! And like the wind, death is always be his side!
[4:40:52] <Teradyne87> I somehow got lucky enough he stuck around with me through Zozo and then dipped in the middle of the next story event
[4:40:59] <Drusain> Forests are almost always better enemies in FF games
[4:41:02] <%TheSaltminer> Jojo All Star Battle Remake huh
[4:41:03] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah South has the dosh
[4:41:20] <Teradyne87> My party was down to two during "That Scene". So much anxiety
[4:41:21] <speximillian> Jojo ASB R. The R stands for rollback?
[4:41:24] <%TheLemuroid> Shadow doesn't attack tho. He throws shurikens
[4:41:29] <@Solidus_113> it better
[4:41:34] <%solracc25> qsave
[4:41:42] <+polothegreatest> LUL jojo rollback
[4:41:44] <rommlll> shif f1
[4:41:51] <%TheSaltminer> sadly all the new characters are probably gonna be from Eyes of Heaven, so I'm missing out on Foof again
[4:41:56] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Please let that game get roll back. DIO in that game is soon much fun
[4:42:05] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> sooooo*
[4:42:06] <BlackermanZX> Asb is confirmed steam i think? so if theres no rollback we have parsec LUL
[4:42:15] <+polothegreatest> isnt just the ps3 version with dlc?
[4:42:19] <speximillian> Sabin's got the biggest single target
[4:42:21] <crimsonharvest> hi
[4:42:31] <speximillian> Drill is slightly weaker than shuriken
[4:42:49] <alrobot2014> Edgar's flash is pretty good damage too
[4:43:15] <speximillian> AoE is usually worth when there's 3 or more targets
[4:43:26] <alrobot2014> the forest up there was also a location
[4:43:50] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[4:44:26] <speximillian> I feel like there's a chocobo stable over here somewhere
[4:44:28] <%Glock3bb> Nah, she's hanging out with Pat.
[4:44:55] <alrobot2014> @speximillian yeah in the forest next to the house
[4:45:03] <+Jiggisnipe> Edgar is an OSHA king

[5:33:32] <Teradyne87> Yes
[5:33:32] <+pectusumbra> I don't remember
[5:33:33] <+Jiggisnipe> yep
[5:33:34] <Drusain> that was in the original
[5:33:35] <dd44dostivei> yes
[5:33:36] <ireliaismaiwaifu> it was a thing
[5:33:37] <iambqb> you could
[5:33:37] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I dont remember that
[5:33:38] <%LouieRouie> Yes
[5:33:39] <alrobot2014> it was in the original but serves no purpose
[5:33:51] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Man learning new stuff about this game even today
[5:34:00] <alrobot2014> its probably there for if you get stuck in that room with the dudes
[5:34:08] <carrion_king_> Is Woolie gonna get the cool thing in this town?
[5:34:13] <+fizzguy47> it's like The Raid fighting up a tower
[5:34:18] <Aussie_Manny> HyperParkour
[5:34:19] <Teradyne87> Try to steal from a Hill Gigas if you feel safe to do so
[5:34:25] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Mug!
[5:34:25] <+pectusumbra> That makes steal into mug I believe
[5:34:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[5:34:40] <Aussie_Manny> MUG
[5:34:40] <+pectusumbra> Mug is steal+attack
[5:34:43] <Crabovision> MUG MOMENT
[5:34:45] <Aussie_Manny> ☕
[5:34:45] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yeah
[5:34:46] <RayCSmooth> shank
[5:34:47] <alrobot2014> mug deals normal attack
[5:34:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Mug them fools!
[5:34:56] <%RaziWraith> Locke be like,"YO, I left this at the house. How did it end up here?"
[5:34:57] <Teradyne87> Dual wielding means two steal attempts
[5:34:59] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Just a normal attack
[5:35:04] <BlackermanZX> this with shadow sounds good
[5:35:07] <cajju_> STEALING IS WRONG
[5:35:08] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I mean if you want to steal but not kill the enemy
[5:35:09] <+vicepresidentrichardhawk> use it all the time
[5:35:09] <%LouieRouie> Other relics
[5:35:09] <ireliaismaiwaifu> you can only use 2 relics
[5:35:10] <rommlll> i think im about to STEAL
[5:35:10] <+pectusumbra> For stealing rare items off rare items
[5:35:10] <majindusto> ALWAYS  MUG
[5:35:15] <speximillian> If you wanna steal something, you can't steal from a corpse
[5:35:21] <RyuuAoi> Mug to get what ya want!
[5:35:22] <alrobot2014> it means you don't get special weapon effects iirc
[5:35:23] <OuendanCyrus> In case you don't want to kill the enemy.
[5:35:25] <Drusain> Only reason not to do it is because you might want a different relic
[5:35:33] <+Jiggisnipe> if you don't want to kill something, then mug is bad
[5:35:44] <iambqb> Yeah Mug runs the risk of killing, makes stealing a lil' harder
[5:35:51] <+pectusumbra> It IS worth it when you really want to steal
[5:35:57] <carrion_king_> MUG MOMENT
[5:36:03] <time_axis> 2 tries seems better than a success rate increase with 1 try, but idk
[5:36:03] <alrobot2014> iirc 25% increase chance on bracer?
[5:36:06] <+pectusumbra> at this point probably brigands for now, Thief's later
[5:36:09] <Drusain> You're not using that knife for the reason of the game
[5:36:09] <+kirkieCanada> plotting to steal some pies woolie?
[5:36:10] <cajju_> mugging is a 5 year sentence and stealing is 2
[5:36:16] <alrobot2014> may be wrong
[5:36:20] <RyuuAoi> Labbin'
[5:36:28] <carrion_king_> Oh no, Woolie is minmaxing his STEAL
[5:36:32] <emptyantics> Mugging only becomes a felony after $1000
[5:36:34] <%Glock3bb> Thief's Bracer doubles the odds of stealing.
[5:36:34] <+vicepresidentrichardhawk> One attack witch BIG chance to steal or two attack witch smaller chance
[5:36:39] <BearSawed> YOU CRAZY? YOU GOT PRIORS MAN
[5:36:43] <damn_it_jeremy> Steal chance = (Locke Level + 50 - Enemy Level) / 128. Thief’s glove doubles that chance
[5:36:43] <$silentblast93> it stacks
[5:36:49] <Narratorway> If I remember from the original, it only steals once.
[5:36:53] <+kirkieCanada> Hide yo kids, hide yo wife! Woolie plotting a steal

[5:56:50] <Teradyne87> The War of the Magi, in a long forgotten land... Milwaukee
[5:56:51] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The one big flaw of this game is there’s no unique dialogue based on party composition
[5:57:08] <%RyTYoung> csbeastSetIn

[5:57:54] <%ChoculaUltra> there we go LUL
[5:57:59] <Aussie_Manny> So there's summons down there, being drained of power?
[5:58:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> So I dont know if its Shadow or party positioning, bur I’m used to Locke in Sabin’s position
[5:58:38] <Aussie_Manny> I assume Sabin is standing in the spot of who you have first in your party.
[5:58:40] <%Glock3bb> God, I love that line!
[5:58:42] <+pectusumbra> Yes. Magiteck is powered by the life of summons/spirit corpses
[5:58:58] <%solracc25> Shadow be like, smells like death
[5:59:15] <Teradyne87> Terra is afraid of being a furry and it's causing her Emotional Damage
[5:59:27] <lotharrio> Oh boy, can't wait for Ramuh to join the party. Look at his... mostly non animated sprite

[6:03:02] <+Jessie_Lockhart> At this point I think Woolie’s trolling us
[6:03:09] <+polothegreatest> plaguePog

[6:03:17] <rinaldiaar> Magic are NFTs: cmv

[6:04:38] <majindusto> Bye Shadow
[6:04:39] <Th3rd3> Peach
[6:04:40] <alrobot2014> @shazbeaut he can go back
[6:04:41] <wombatish> Oh shit, did Woolie leave without picking up the other 3 magicite?
[6:04:43] <%AngryAsian5> Peace out fuckers LUL
[6:04:44] <+RegularCore> shadow needs to buy cigarettes
[6:04:48] <+pectusumbra> Can save and go get the chainsaw
[6:04:50] <%LouieRouie> Edgar and Sabin
[6:04:50] <hentaimaxer> shadow leaves when you grind too much
[6:04:50] <Crabovision> no he took them
[6:04:52] <time_axis> @wombatish he picked them up
[6:04:54] <linSP> homework, get chainsaw
[6:04:58] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @wombatish he picked them up
[6:05:00] <nyacoo> Is the chance even still 1/16 in the remake?
[6:05:11] <+Jiggisnipe> it might not be
[6:05:18] <Aussie_Manny> "Now give my equipment back." "Give what back?"
[6:05:19] <wombatish> @Damashi_The_Kaotic phew. my stream stuttered for a sec
[6:05:29] <+Jiggisnipe> but it's still funny to talk about it
[6:05:29] <%Glock3bb> Gonna wanna take Edgar and Sabin!
[6:05:30] <lotharrio> Ever trusting Shadow to stick around. HahaSweat HahaShrugRight
[6:06:04] <%Glock3bb> It's worth it!
[6:06:09] <Th3rd3> let Cyan babysitting Gao
[6:06:13] <+pectusumbra> Woolie, don't worry. You'll get LOTS of time
[6:06:18] <speximillian> Gau gets no love ever
[6:06:19] <alrobot2014> they'll have their story moments later
[6:06:21] <KericInfinitum> Sabin is very strong at this point in the game
[6:06:26] <%BestTeaMaker> this game is hours long
[6:06:27] <+Jiggisnipe> yea keep Edgar and Sabin for plot
[6:06:28] <dinnydanny777> Oh ratJAM
[6:06:30] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> they'll be time for Gau and Cyan later
[6:06:34] <+Jessie_Lockhart> They’ll get play time for sure
[6:06:36] <+CelioHogane> Goodbye cooler members
[6:06:45] <Aussie_Manny> chairVictory chairVictory chairVictory chairVictory
[6:06:56] <CyrusHalberd13> Seems like a good team to me.
[6:07:15] <+RegularCore> so it's blind for woolie and second for reggie?
[6:07:25] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Celes ended up being my powerhouse. She's well balanced.
[6:07:25] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[6:07:37] <lotharrio> That ghost though!
[6:07:38] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Wink wink nudge nudge
[6:07:39] <Teradyne87> Oh hey, a ghost
[6:07:42] <twoto858> YEAH ZOZO RULES
[6:07:46] <Aussie_Manny> PISS OFF, GHOST
[6:07:51] <+Jiggisnipe> Zozo is a place alright
[6:07:53] <%solracc25> Yo Ghost?
[6:07:54] <hentaimaxer> celes and terra are both really good in stats
[6:07:55] <carrion_king_> Tutorial ghost!
[6:08:01] <Aussie_Manny> woolieYIKES
[6:08:06] <Th3rd3> told you Zozo's funny town
[6:08:11] <%solracc25> train broke remember
[6:08:11] <majindusto> ZOZO  IS FUCKED  lol
[6:08:12] <dd44dostivei> nobody's ever really gone
[6:08:14] <@SoushinSen> Why is a ghost standing there? "it is a mystery"
[6:08:15] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Zozo really is a Fromsoft area isnt it
[6:08:16] <+RegularCore> zozo is kinda shit ppl can't afford to die
[6:08:20] <CyrusHalberd13> There is one more thing you can do here, I believe.
[6:08:21] <alrobot2014> say hello to proto materia
[6:08:22] <+alextheblight> RPGGhosto
[6:08:24] <AbnormalVoid> this one's just a spooky tutorial man, not a ghost
[6:08:26] <+JupiterDjin> There's a lot of dead people to pick up from ZoZo after what you just did, Woolie.
[6:08:47] <nyacoo> GFs
[6:08:50] <+fizzguy47> junctions
[6:08:51] <+Jiggisnipe> time to minmax
[6:09:03] <hentaimaxer> Do natural magic run, cowards
[6:09:03] <+pectusumbra> They give you level ups
[6:09:03] <lotharrio> No, they level you.
[6:09:07] <alrobot2014> yep
[6:09:07] <+Jessie_Lockhart> More they level YOU up
[6:09:08] <+Jiggisnipe> no they make you better
[6:09:13] <KericInfinitum> no they level you
[6:09:15] <alrobot2014> the esper doesn't level
[6:09:19] <OuendanCyrus> This is the only way to increase Strength, Agility, Magic, and Stamina.
[6:09:33] <+pectusumbra> the esper is just an equip
[6:09:41] <alrobot2014> everyone in the game can have all the spells
[6:09:41] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> The Esper is dead it can't level up
[6:09:45] <carrion_king_> Think of Espers like styles in Devil May Cry
[6:09:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:09:50] <%tempestzephyr> Oh, so it's bad to early game grind?
[6:09:59] <lotharrio> The real thing you do is give healing magic to anyone who has good abilities, and teach magic to people who don't have Blitz/Tools/etc
[6:10:07] <hentaimaxer> @tempestzephyr ya
[6:10:17] <+Jessie_Lockhart> They are worth having on at all times for the level up and in some cases the summon’s attack
[6:10:22] <+Jiggisnipe> if you wanna minmax you can switch right before a battle when you know you'll level
[6:10:29] <+pectusumbra> @tempestzephyr correct! Levels at base in this game only give HP. You MUST use Magicite to get level bonuses
[6:10:36] <hentaimaxer> if you grind at the rift with banon you gimp your party
[6:10:39] <Teradyne87> Teach spells to anyone and everyone, then switch when you're about to level to get stat gains
[6:10:42] <lotharrio> FF5 had him.... FF4 too I think.
[6:10:50] <Aussie_Manny> Yeah, Ramuh is the usual Lightning summon.
[6:10:52] <alrobot2014> even as a summon in previous games they sometimes talk
[6:10:56] <%ChoculaUltra> cat rain would absolutely destroy my allergies
[6:10:59] <hentaimaxer> but the game is too easy for it to matter tho
[6:11:06] <+pectusumbra> And now every character can get magic
[6:11:22] <carrion_king_> No you get 3 percent per ap per battle
[6:11:23] <KericInfinitum> it's a multiplier
[6:11:24] <+pectusumbra> When you clear fights, you get AP, which gets multiplied
[6:11:25] <%BestTeaMaker> man, they show percentage now
[6:11:26] <+Tornix> it's the multiplier for AP
[6:11:33] <+scorpiozilla> It's Acquisition rate times AP.
[6:11:35] <alrobot2014> in FF5 Ramuh and Ifrit are friends and Ramuh agrees to join the party if you have Ifrit
[6:11:36] <Teradyne87> Each battle gives you Ability points, that's a multiplier not a percentage
[6:11:42] <lotharrio> Tougher enemies will give more acquisition points.
[6:11:43] <Drusain> You get ability points per fight, multiply that by what you see on the screen here
[6:11:44] <+Jiggisnipe> AP
[6:11:46] <%Glock3bb> AP
[6:11:47] <KericInfinitum> AP
[6:11:50] <+Jessie_Lockhart> You now gain magic points at the end of fights. The x3 is magic points gained times 3
[6:11:50] <OuendanCyrus> AP.
[6:11:54] <+pectusumbra> Equip some magicite, get in a fight, you'll see
[6:11:58] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Just need 100 to learn it
[6:12:04] <Th3rd3> this is the birth of materia TPFufun
[6:12:13] <Teradyne87> Ability/ Acquisition Points
[6:12:18] <+scorpiozilla> Every battle gives at least 1 AP.
[6:12:21] <+pectusumbra> correct
[6:12:22] <alrobot2014> yes
[6:12:23] <iambqb> yeah
[6:12:25] <Drusain> Yes overlap
[6:12:25] <+Tornix> yes
[6:12:27] <%Glock3bb> Yes.
[6:12:29] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yep
[6:12:32] <Teradyne87> Yes, you learn all the spells concurrently
[6:13:07] <alrobot2014> sometimes same magic but different acquisition rate
[6:13:11] <lotharrio> Yeah, later Espers will have better rates for learning.
[6:13:12] <+pectusumbra> And it ties back into the plot very nicely
[6:13:13] <+hatok> rarer espers have faster learn rates for low level spells
[6:13:21] <hentaimaxer> some characters learn magic by themselves without espers
[6:13:26] <Shazbeaut> some teach faster, some give more useful stats
[6:13:26] <Teradyne87> And then the magic is that character's forever
[6:13:34] <+pectusumbra> You have hit the 25% mark
[6:13:40] <Kinraiku> Gf precursor??
[6:13:41] <iambqb> Zozo still got some stuff
[6:13:41] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[6:13:42] <alrobot2014> to use the summon tap up in the magic menu in a fight
[6:13:43] <Teradyne87> You're not done in Zozo
[6:13:48] <+rbakervv> did he equip the espers?
[6:13:49] <+JupiterDjin> ZoZo? Not even once.
[6:13:50] <%sssoapy> lmao
[6:13:50] <+pectusumbra> You'll be back
[6:13:50] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Whats a Zozo? pieSmug
[6:13:57] <OuendanCyrus> Did Woolie solve the clock puzzle?
[6:13:59] <KericInfinitum> There is something good in Zozo
[6:14:04] <hentaimaxer> you left treasure btw
[6:14:05] <alrobot2014> no

[6:24:55] <BlackermanZX> Returnal coop
[6:24:59] <%ekodrop> looked like all version of tournament fighters
[6:25:12] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[6:25:23] <%ekodrop> completely revamped and improved version of the fight system first introduced in 2013, upping the tempo with hit stops, dashes, intricate new combos, and an all-new “Support Attack” tag-team battle system
[6:25:31] <lonosis47> Reggie wanted to watch the direct

[6:27:01] <+polothegreatest> Everything? plagueWut
[6:27:02] <@Solidus_113> Still waiting for Heritage
[6:27:07] <+hatok> it apparently plays better now
[6:27:20] <+Jiggisnipe> might be real now
[6:27:31] <Zebroneath> It's mentioned that there will be "gameplay adjustments" for JJ:ASB:R
[6:27:44] <alrobot2014> Valkyrie Elysium reminds me I need to play Profile
[6:27:51] <+EdgySalad> Tactics games? oh heck
[6:27:57] <%ekodrop> the last one was a mobile game that died
[6:27:58] <+EdgySalad> need those
[6:27:59] <+Jiggisnipe> a mobile game Kappa
[6:28:04] <alrobot2014> early 2000s was Profile 2
[6:28:08] <iambqb> Covenant of the Plume was 2008
[6:28:15] <%Namillus> The last Valkyrie Profile game came out on DS and there also was a gacha game that Did Not Fare Well.
[6:28:16] <artoflec> been a looong time since anything Valkyrie yeah
[6:28:24] <@Solidus_113> it's the fun one
[6:28:25] <RyuuAoi> JoJo's Advance Adventure
[6:28:38] <+Jiggisnipe> the CPS3 fighting game
[6:28:43] <artoflec> Soleil is making the new Valkyrie game (former team ninja, made the recent samurai jack game, and helped with No More Heroes 3)
[6:29:17] <alrobot2014> not tri-ace?
[6:29:19] <artoflec> for Diofield Chronicle, the game of thrones composer is doing the music 👀 Ramin Djawadi
[6:29:29] <%ekodrop> wasn't that the game that limited the amount you could play it?
[6:29:32] <+EdgySalad> @woolieversus With Front Mission coming to the west, LP when???
[6:29:33] <RyuuAoi> When's Parasite Eve 4?
[6:29:38] <lonosis47> The valkyrie game will be another platinum disaster
