[0:02:22] <%Ensign_Epic> General advice to avoid Elden Ring spoilers going forward -  Staying off of Twitter & 4chan are musts. Vocaroo links are to be presumed to be dialogue lines, wherever you see them. Just to be safe. Maybe wanna unjoin some more 4channy subreddits, and turn off or ignore PMs for the time being.
[0:02:25] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[0:02:31] <@Menitta> just in time yay
[0:02:33] <youngking_kush> Guys his name is SHAF MOSS now
[0:02:34] <DSD24> Yo that's some heavy shit there man

[0:02:40] <youngking_kush> SHAD MOSS*
[0:02:47] <%Ensign_Epic> Probably also wanna set up a YouTube block

[0:03:10] <%Necnill> LUL
[0:03:11] <%superc37> wait how are there elden ring spoilers already? the release date is like months away
[0:03:15] <peachy996> I appreciate your enjoyment of music but could you please...?
[0:03:16] <Voidvas> Lil Bow Wow does not "Go Raw"
[0:03:17] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[0:03:18] <quamdunk> Thee Shad Moss???
[0:03:18] <%leith_aziz> @superc37 Leaks
[0:03:22] <+Jiggisnipe> like in a limo with rolling a window up Kappa
[0:03:25] <%holydeviant1> I dunno, as an introvert, letting someone know "Not in the mood, sorry" isn't that rude
[0:03:27] <+2Vibe2Check> @Ensign_Epic MVP advice
[0:03:29] <%leith_aziz> Shadow Moss-ess
[0:03:45] <oda_flobunaga> @holydeviant1 PREACH
[0:03:58] <%CyberArtClub> no longer accommodating extroverts for me
[0:04:00] <peachy996> It's rough being the type that doesn't like conversation
[0:04:07] <%holydeviant1> I don't hate YOU, I just don't wanna talk!
[0:04:08] <%Ensign_Epic> @superc37 tl;dr PS4 jailbreak allowed for network test to be datamined, and they left in pretty much everything that comprises the game's story
[0:04:10] <%A_German_spy> @superc37 New firmware jailbreak, leading to the ER network test being dumped and disassembled.
[0:04:17] <peachy996> I'm not interested in your day and you don't need to know about me
[0:04:27] <%superc37> oh holy shit
[0:04:30] <%NahmenJayden> know what works for me? just say you're hung over
[0:04:30] <cj_art> "i would really prefer if you'd be quiet"

[0:04:35] <bustahwuulf> Combed Reggie? PogChamp
[0:04:38] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Honestly, I get the sense that the driver doesn't want to talk half the time either.
[0:04:38] <quamdunk> Kinda wild lol
[0:04:49] <@Menitta> It's like that one trolley meme. you CAN stop this but you'd have to make small talk and shake people's hands.
[0:04:56] <%holydeviant1> But then again people say Seattle is full of ice-cold motherfucks, so whatever
[0:05:02] <%Ensign_Epic> So the WHOLE game is not out there, but everything that matters to the story & many base mechanics ARE now out there.
[0:05:10] <%superc37> @leith_aziz yeah sure whatever so where are these leaks cuz im interested in seeing them
[0:05:11] <peachy996> Maybe you should flirt with them and shock them into uncomfortable silence
[0:05:25] <DSD24> That's why when you can drive yourself to places is the best
[0:05:41] <peachy996> We need to start weaponizing awkward silence
[0:05:42] <%CyberArtClub> @Menitta that's hilarious. I now have something to laugh at when I think of that damned trolley question
[0:05:51] <zhenthrim213> perfection
[0:05:56] <%CateHecate> and you both have those shaded jojo eyes the entire time

[0:08:43] <peachy996> The grass doesn't do anything
[0:08:48] <emptyantics> @abelincoln_catpuncher I just did time and had to do Community service too lol
[0:08:48] <oneimportantthing> Reggie about to either have a lucky day or a terrible day
[0:08:53] <%Ensign_Epic> 90% of the time community service is involuntary, done as an alternative to jail
[0:08:55] <@Menitta> I had to for both High School and Scouts
[0:08:56] <Arqartur0> Greetings Raeggarth and Woolsworth, keepers of the Flame. I hope you are free from the clutches of Dokapon
[0:08:58] <+Kyma1020> I know you need to do community service for school
[0:09:01] <%xyxlzyzm> if homie is biking 5 miles in the snow it's probably not voluntary lol
[0:09:05] <%Vigonept> its totally forced in schools here
[0:09:08] <OldManDeckardCain> darli dagger is apparently gonna be in kof 15 LUL
[0:09:10] <%Bread_Assassin> I had mandatory community service back in school.

[0:13:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Defense isn't maxed, but even if it was, at this point in the game shit would be one shotting him anyway
[0:13:10] <+Shishi1205> @urkleturtle the most poise oput of the light ones

[0:14:05] <mikash91> I forget, did woolz tell reggie how the bug door opens?
[0:14:10] <+Shishi1205> @Johannen If Reggie only plays once its bs
[0:14:13] <Arqartur0> Reggie got back!
[0:14:14] <+OfficerMods> "who cares about defense if I can shoot them with my 12 gauge wand" - nerd bout to get clapped

[0:14:49] <+CapnClassix> Why do the statues move? Just use the same model as the enemy?
[0:14:52] <mikash91> know they opened it, mean if he said its linked to the servants of chaos covenant
[0:14:56] <Johannen> @Shishi1205 Not realy, its kinda meh if you save him cause nothing happens afterward until an unnesecary summon for final boss
[0:15:04] <oneimportantthing> There's something adorable about how unfinished this area is
[0:15:08] <%Lion_kun> I absolutely love Reggie has decided to use the MGS
[0:15:10] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus If Reggie wants stamina regen for more swings he can change his shield. He has the magic one
[0:15:28] <%Lion_kun> If only he would remember to use that R2

[0:17:30] <%A_German_spy> @Pillagius It was. This zone didn't get the dev time they intended to give it, hence all the copy-pasted enemies everywhere.
[0:17:30] <+Bitscreed> In DS2 that drop would've been fatal
[0:17:33] <DSD24> Nothing wrong with calling things cute!
[0:17:38] <Mrscribbles> Reggie's got this boss easy

[0:27:46] <subjectg> Good thing the next boss is incredible at humbling people
[0:27:47] <%holydeviant1> I love how reggie swings between supreme confidence and depressed meloncholy

[0:27:52] <%papa_doomy> welcome to the roast
[0:27:53] <+Shishi1205> I mean dukes was a rough zone for reggie
[0:27:54] <+Rafraud> Woolie talking like he's not gonna luck out on bed
[0:27:55] <Grim1952> Nothing hard await anyways
[0:27:55] <247psi> he's just s0 strOnG
[0:27:59] <AvroEltz> Your smugness will be put to fucking sleep
[0:28:01] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus Reggie seems to making his bed.  Pretty soon he's going to have to lie in it
[0:28:06] <brunoberserk> that wall always fool everyone
[0:28:09] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:28:10] <%Xaeveax> A certain item perhaps
[0:28:16] <Ros_Bef> Cant wait for that confidence to plummet with BoC
[0:28:18] <%RyTYoung> The bed is approaching Kappa
[0:28:24] <subjectg> finding the door out of here is hard for some reason
[0:28:24] <%FallenAngelZelos> making his BED you say?
[0:28:27] <RyuuAoi> He got the heavy boots
[0:28:32] <%ThePich> btw show reggie how blinding Lava was in the OG version
[0:28:32] <%FrostedZaibatsu> @NahmenJayden  thanks for the gifted. Just saw the note woolieF
[0:28:38] <%theoldone001> You can see Centipede Demon from the start of the zone. Chilling on the wall.
[0:28:43] <subjectg> It’s even harder with the og lava
[0:28:47] <subjectg> to see the way out
[0:28:52] <%Bluwizard21> @WoolieVersus Also mention that the last bondifre you could see the centipede demon next to that brave soul he picked up
[0:28:54] <%hax_metatron> ALL AROUND LOST IZALITH CURRENTLY: MENACING
[0:28:58] <%Xaeveax> @subjectg Bloom city
[0:28:58] <%Rasheedt> woolieT
[0:29:04] <emptyantics> @ThePich Holy shit I forgot how bad it was
[0:29:04] <oneimportantthing> Reggie will do the DLC right?
[0:29:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Make your bed"
[0:29:11] <depressioncherrie> Make your bed Kappa
[0:29:13] <%RyTYoung> @oneimportantthing for sure
[0:29:15] <federleicht> make. your. BED
[0:29:17] <brunoberserk> ''make your bed'' DarkMode
[0:29:17] <%asakura_ayase> “Make your bed” indeed
[0:29:21] <emptyantics> @oneimportantthing saving DLC for last
[0:29:24] <@Menitta> you've made your bed now shit in it.
[0:29:25] <rasamune> Aw dang I missed it, did he one-shot the Centipede
[0:29:26] <LunarRemix> The ring also makes your kicks do fire damage for some reason
[0:29:28] <Solidnick18> i haven't watched in awhile... what is reggie rocking and doing?
[0:29:31] <%Bluwizard21> fall into the bed you made
[0:29:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:29:33] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[0:29:37] <Riyokuno> bed OF..?
[0:29:39] <%Xaeveax> @LunarRemix I never knew that!
[0:29:39] <%Lion_kun> Does the MGS have a downward attack
[0:29:41] <DSD24> @Solidnick18 He's got the Moonlight Greatsword!
[0:29:41] <urkleturtle> int endurance. or attunement for more slots
[0:29:42] <subjectg> @solidnick18 mlgs +5
[0:29:46] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus int for crystal soul spear
[0:29:48] <%RyTYoung> @riyokuno nails?
[0:29:50] <%theoldone001> Woolie said the DLC will come last.
[0:29:58] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Don't forget you still have an even more powerful version of Soul Spear that you can buy if you wanna save up for it.
[0:29:59] <radiorosewater> @Lion_kun Second R2
[0:29:59] <Solidnick18> Oh that's good for his style
[0:30:03] <%Dopamien> ill take a super size calebFAT
[0:30:04] <subjectg> @lion_kun 2 handed r1 and 1 handed r2 are overheads
[0:30:14] <%Prevot> STR is pointless for MLGS and barely did anything for the Catch Pole anyway
[0:30:19] <Darren716> @woolieversus Make sure to save souls for Big Hats quest, as an Int build Reggie will really want his catalyst and spell
[0:30:26] <%Lion_kun> He will need it for Siegward quest
[0:30:27] <%swesterly> He got 7 fucking points of damage bonus from the last int level
[0:30:31] <%theoldone001> Any more Big Hat spells?
[0:30:43] <%Lion_kun> All that strength was kinda wasted
[0:30:45] <Slim_Lipid> it's time to dump it all into resistance Kreygasm
[0:30:53] <%Lion_kun> Could have been used for int or attunement
[0:30:57] <+Shishi1205> 1 havel 1 mg ring is good
[0:30:59] <LunarRemix> They boost sorcery damage by 20% which is really worth it for big spells like Magic Spears
[0:31:00] <velgaduere> @Lion_kun nah, he'll run into things with high magic res again
[0:31:08] <subjectg> This is what i really don’t like about ds1 with no respeccing
[0:31:18] <Darren716> Oh shit he doesn't have bellowing yet? Get that ring for sure
[0:31:20] <subjectg> Wish they added an option for that in remastered
[0:31:22] <+FanServ> they removed upgrades to armor after this game, and for good reason
[0:31:23] <%Prevot> oh if you get that ring you're gonna do some busted damage
[0:31:24] <%theoldone001> Some hats have magic effects
[0:31:30] <%Lion_kun> Respeccing is the shit.
[0:31:35] <BearSawed> Upgrade pig hat
[0:31:41] <+vaderxyz1970> Is reggie going to become a Magical Girl by the end of this playthough?
[0:31:43] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Griggs has the rings, at Firelink, yeah
[0:31:46] <Make_me_mad> Removing armor upgrades is one of the things that made me hate the later DS games.
[0:31:50] <+Shishi1205> bloodbite
[0:31:52] <GHouseduivel> @vaderxyz1970 Already there baby B)
[0:31:54] <%Xaeveax> @vaderxyz1970 Transformation sequences and all
[0:31:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Pardoner only has Rings of Sacrifice and status resistance rings
[0:32:13] <Darren716> @woolieversus also Reggie can get dusks crown in the basin right now that is a raw 20% spell damage boost, on top of the ring
[0:32:16] <velgaduere> he's had it for a really, really long time and just never used it
[0:32:21] <+Shishi1205> that one for power within?
[0:32:26] <+Bitscreed> "Don't forget to aim." LUL
[0:32:26] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Bellowing is damage, Lingering is extra buff duration.
[0:32:27] <%theoldone001> Logan has the magic damage ring I think
[0:32:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DQ ring LUL
[0:32:50] <OblivionSword1> gotta test it
[0:32:50] <LunarRemix> It boosts Sorcery AND Pyromancy damage
[0:32:51] <%Lion_kun> How much extra damage Spy
[0:32:52] <%AbnormalVoid> gotta test
[0:32:54] <%Qsmash_> he has two different rings that look similar
[0:32:55] <+Shishi1205> 20
[0:32:56] <@Solidus_113> it's about a 20% buff
[0:32:59] <+セビー> dusk crown or moonlight crown.. but then we lose board
[0:33:02] <velgaduere> it's very good
[0:33:05] <%AbnormalVoid> it's very substantial
[0:33:06] <RyuuAoi> Honestly Reggie. MAX out boar helm stats. Where is the downside?
[0:33:07] <+セビー> boar*
[0:33:10] <%Qsmash_> the sorcerer I mean
[0:33:14] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Bellowing doesn't reflect its boost in the menus, but it's a very significant boost.
[0:33:22] <velgaduere> would've melted centipede in all 4 soul spears, probably
[0:33:25] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus dusk crown for more mg dmg
[0:33:38] <subjectg> boosts to spells and miracles don’t show up because they have no AR to show
[0:33:40] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus power whtin
[0:33:40] <GHouseduivel> Does it only affect sorcery, or magic dmg in general ??
[0:33:42] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Lingering can extend the duration of Power Within and slow the HP erosion.
[0:33:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> Power Within duration
[0:33:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> helps with power within
[0:33:52] <%DextralMalin> Do they need Havel's ring with this setup btw?
[0:34:05] <%Lion_kun> Heavy armor
[0:34:05] <federleicht> aye siwmae
[0:34:06] <%A_German_spy> @GHouseduivel Everything except miracles, which have their own ring
[0:34:09] <JairusHopesItWorks> can he buy second soul spear?
[0:34:14] <ds3namecaldara> yo didn't know that about power within
[0:34:18] <GHouseduivel> @A_German_spy Holy moley
[0:34:22] <+Shishi1205> @JairusHopesItWorks if he pops his souls
[0:34:23] <%Bluwizard21> that firebomb damage
[0:34:42] <+vaderxyz1970> WITNESS ME
[0:34:47] <sniffy77> Look at that fucking FASHION Reggie is wearing
[0:34:48] <DSD24> Yo see that shit!?
[0:34:53] <subjectg> Giving i-frames to enemies was really annoying in this one
[0:34:53] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus If Reggie likes power within the ring magic boy has can extend his duration
[0:34:55] <oda_flobunaga> Kaaaaaaaaaaarl that kills people
[0:35:02] <DSD24> Aye
[0:35:12] <RyuuAoi> Reggie dropped the pole!? Wher tf have I been?
[0:35:15] <velgaduere> haha :)
[0:35:16] <Make_me_mad> Twitch has ads that pop up and shrink the stream window now? That's fun.
[0:35:19] <%mr_sups> Aye Simwae
[0:35:30] <subjectg> “Pay up fucker”
[0:35:41] <daswampken> >when your boi goes one round over arslan ash
[0:35:43] <%linSP> Cool helm
[0:35:43] <%mr_sups> I rocked the Ornstein set
[0:35:50] <Darren716> The moonlight helm also boosts spells
[0:35:54] <federleicht> gwyndolins crown boosts sorcery by 10%
[0:36:01] <%mr_sups> Reggie the BOAR
[0:36:02] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Gwyndolin's helmet increases your magic damage, if you wanna go that route.
[0:36:04] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus If he wants armor for magic function/dmg dusk's crown is what he needs
[0:36:08] <+ExFireFist> screw that drip or drown
[0:36:10] <%Seancicle> nous parlons avec mains
[0:36:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at this point it's mostly an aesthetic choice, though you gotta have the cash for it
[0:36:17] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Welsh set is punk af
[0:36:18] <+Shishi1205> @A_German_spy that one too
[0:36:32] <%linSP> The chest piece is pretty cool
[0:36:32] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[0:36:40] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Just the helmet, yeah.
[0:36:45] <%Prevot> I doubt he's gonna take off the boar for a magic helmet
[0:37:02] <+Shishi1205> @Prevot magic dps tho
[0:37:03] <subjectg> he’s not gonna take off the boar head, woolie LUL
[0:37:13] <radiorosewater> BOAR STAYS ON
[0:37:14] <%AbnormalVoid> how much compared to dusk crown
[0:37:26] <youngking_kush> That helmet heavy af son lol
[0:37:28] <JairusHopesItWorks> 8 soul spears is busted if he gets it
[0:37:28] <%linSP> please.. not the boar...
[0:37:29] <zhenthrim213> BOAR WIZARD
[0:37:31] <@Solidus_113> BiS
[0:37:34] <subjectg> crown is 20%, moonlight is 10% @abnormalvoid
[0:37:37] <Darren716> Dusk is 20%,crown is 10%
[0:37:38] <BearSawed> PIGGY Playthrough confirm?
[0:37:41] <+ExFireFist> sorry babe the boar head stays on during segs
[0:37:48] <Darren716> But dusk decreases magic Def
[0:37:49] <%AbnormalVoid> cool
[0:37:50] <velgaduere> yooooo
[0:37:59] <subjectg> don’t be a meta slave, that’s my advice for reggie
[0:38:07] <%r3dfall3142> r3dfall3142 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! The adventures of Reggarth the Beast and his Guiding Light continue. May his scary high luck continue to deliver.
[0:38:17] <+Jiggisnipe> Fashion Souls baybee
[0:38:18] <%theoldone001> The crown looks cool I think
[0:38:23] <BearSawed> Hey Reggie....Pick a top tier
[0:38:24] <+ExFireFist> Drip Souls
[0:38:26] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[0:38:30] <youngking_kush> Reggarth, the Holy Blade
[0:38:34] <+mace210> maggotry LUL
[0:38:36] <+Shishi1205> 10%
[0:38:41] <youngking_kush> #PickATopTier
[0:38:48] <+Shishi1205> 10% from that + 20% from the ring
[0:38:51] <velgaduere> Reggie's literally looking through boss gear right now. homie is looking at boss characters on the select screen
[0:38:54] <DSD24> We need Giant Dad
[0:38:54] <%RyTYoung> Reggie must've put all his luck stats into DS instead of Dokapon Kappa
[0:38:55] <Darren716> I just did a run with dusks crown, channelers set, moonlight greatsword, and crystal spells, was rad
[0:38:55] <+retro_godfather> debatable woolie LUL
[0:39:00] <AvroEltz> go moonlight set with boar helm, pump endurance until fast roll, put flip ring, magic flipper boar
[0:39:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yo, boarstein?
[0:39:02] <420mangojuice> !uptime
[0:39:03] <@Moobot> @420mangojuice WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 50 minutes and 19 seconds
[0:39:04] <ChoculaUltra> the LP has introduced me to my new vice - high stakes channel point gambling babyyyyyy
[0:39:13] <%Prevot> ornstein armor is a fucking lie btw, it looks like it should have a warm golden color but its actually silver
[0:39:15] <+mace210> @DSD24 AGREED
[0:39:29] <+vaderxyz1970> Does that mag damage increase Moonlight greatsword damage?
[0:39:37] <Darren716> Sadly no
[0:39:41] <Darren716> just spells
[0:39:43] <subjectg> @prevot it’s gold enough to not synergize with any other armor other than giant’s though
[0:39:44] <BearSawed> Equip BASS CANON
[0:39:44] <420mangojuice> buying trap clothing....
[0:39:45] <+Shishi1205> if he deals 500 raw he would deal 650 with ring + head
[0:39:47] <youngking_kush> @prevot Yeah, it's like gold that's lost its luster
[0:40:01] <%A_German_spy> @vaderxyz1970 MLGS sadly isn't subject to the bonuses from any spell damage buffs except Red Tearstone
[0:40:10] <%Prevot> @subjectg I say its silver enough to fit perfectly with the silver knight set
[0:40:22] <%AbnormalVoid> WHEELING AND DEALING
[0:40:30] <subjectg> did mlgs gain damage from the magic clutch ring in the later games? I think it did
[0:40:53] <%A_German_spy> @subjectg Magic Clutch, yes. Bellowing Dragoncrest, no.
[0:41:00] <Treasure_Vault> Did they mention what the crown looks like? I just got back.
[0:41:03] <Darren716> I really hope Woolie changes his mind about Logans quest, I think the fight is fun and you get so much rad shit from it
[0:41:12] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus there's another headgear that gives +20% dusks crown
[0:41:18] <%Xaeveax> @Treasure_Vault Yup
[0:41:24] <youngking_kush> @darren716 If none of that others that's one Reggie needs 5o do
[0:41:30] <+Jiggisnipe> man he looks dumb
[0:41:33] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:41:36] <%superc37> what the fuck is this abomination
[0:41:36] <velgaduere> Anti-Fashion
[0:41:36] <DSD24> The style is going down
[0:41:38] <LunarRemix> He looks like a minmaxer
[0:41:38] <taeko_ohnuki> I thought I was looking at Cloud Strife for a second
[0:41:38] <%A_German_spy> @Shishi1205 They haven't gotten it yet to my knowledge, and I doubt they'll be down there again until they get to the DLC.
[0:41:41] <Treasure_Vault> @Xaeveax neat, thanks
[0:41:41] <%Prevot> oof
[0:41:41] <zhenthrim213> MOONROCK
[0:41:44] <subjectg> Fashion go DOWN
[0:41:53] <+Shishi1205> @A_German_spy dont you get her gear from saving her?
[0:41:54] <%Seancicle> 😁
[0:41:55] <420mangojuice> no fashion sense absolutely none
[0:41:56] <Voidvas> BIG PIG
[0:41:57] <radiorosewater> weird
[0:41:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:42:01] <+Shishi1205> Like first time?
[0:42:08] <%livlinn> I like it
[0:42:10] <radiorosewater> :)
[0:42:13] <%JetpackMcQuack> oink oink motherfucker
[0:42:16] <subjectg> Havel’s has been ruined by how many scrubs use it in pvp
[0:42:17] <%A_German_spy> @Shishi1205 AFTER saving her. You have to reload in between, then go back for it.
[0:42:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It looked nicer in original Dark Souls I think
[0:42:26] <%AbnormalVoid> Stone armor body
[0:42:27] <%livlinn> Boar makes everything better woolieMIRIN
[0:42:28] <peachy996> just get a silver can of spray paint and make that shit match
[0:42:29] <urkleturtle> that's why his gloves are the only thing that goes with other sets. because of the chains
[0:42:30] <%Prevot> the helm and chest of havel look fucking awful
[0:42:35] <%linSP> can you snoof what the rock is cooking
[0:42:36] <%waltzqueen> Boar = Better
[0:42:40] <JairusHopesItWorks> if you go full magic you can get more soul spear from the apprentice
[0:43:01] <420mangojuice> forget numbers its all about FASHION
[0:43:02] <+retro_godfather> fashion is always the most important stat
[0:43:12] <youngking_kush> @woolieversus Yall dont forget to buy a 2nd Soul Spear from here for 8 casts
[0:43:16] <+Shishi1205> @A_German_spy I thought it was base game
[0:43:17] <subjectg> Just go elite knight with havel’s gauntlets, wanderer boots
[0:43:17] <Darren716> @a_german_spy nah you get it right at the start once you have the pendant, dusks set is just chilling in the basin
[0:43:29] <velgaduere> @youngking_kush huge if true
[0:43:51] <%AbnormalVoid> just pirate it Kappa

[0:43:53] <pyjama_day> good evening everyone
[0:43:54] <+Shishi1205> @A_German_spy I just looked it up you have to summon her
[0:43:58] <youngking_kush> @velgaduere It is, I just beat the game with Reggie's build last week
[0:44:12] <Fireball_Spam> Domhnall sure picks the weirdest places for his shops.
[0:44:19] <Fireball_Spam> At least Firelink Shrine has a nice view.

[0:44:39] <%holydeviant1> There are like two weapons in the game that are actually cursed themselves
[0:44:42] <%Lion_kun> Is there a weapon type that can hit ghosts
[0:44:43] <%A_German_spy> @Shishi1205 Just summoning her doesn't get you her gear, though. After you rescue her, you have to reload the area, then walk back to where the golem was and pick up her set from a corpse in the corner.
[0:44:46] <Fireball_Spam> The necromancers.
[0:44:46] <+Shishi1205> @youngking_kush also works for pyros like orb or balls
[0:44:51] <subjectg> Fun little thing: there’s a dev message here with seek guidance, hinting that a merchant moves here
[0:45:04] <+Shishi1205> @A_German_spy yeah summon + quit
[0:45:19] <subjectg> The ghost blades and the cursed arty blade can hit ghosts
[0:45:35] <%holydeviant1> THis guy has been everywhere and heard it all

[0:46:28] <thinktank1> dude thats sick
[0:46:29] <derap41> That looks cool
[0:46:30] <Awesome_Leaf> sexy beast
[0:46:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> ornstein knows how to dress
[0:46:33] <%Ensign_Epic> that's my armor of choice
[0:46:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BOARNSTEIN
[0:46:39] <%Invlux> that's actually pretty sick
[0:46:45] <Slim_Lipid> battle dress PogBones
[0:46:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> Havel's gloves clash with it
[0:46:48] <velgaduere> we've evolved from BOAR SHAMAN into BOARSTEIN
[0:46:48] <subjectg> Ooh why does it look more silver in the remaster? That’s dumb
[0:46:49] <%gitgouda> REGGARTH HAS DONE IT. hes reached full fashion souls.
[0:46:53] <+vaderxyz1970> Keep the parashute pants
[0:46:55] <Awesome_Leaf> @cobalt_phoenix_ fantastic
[0:46:57] <%livlinn> shandLove
[0:46:57] <%Xaeveax> I hate how the Ornstein helmet looks. The rest is sick but the helmet looks stupid to me.
[0:46:59] <%gitgouda> im...im so proud yet again
[0:47:00] <radiorosewater> absolute sex icon
[0:47:04] <%CateHecate> mc hammer armor pants
[0:47:13] <nxflre> @subjectg think its just the lighting heere
[0:47:14] <KaiserMario> I believe Ornstein set reduces stamina regen a little
[0:47:18] <%Vigonept> the helmet needs the red plume. like in ds3
[0:47:19] <%Ensign_Epic> Ornstein Armor, SK Leggings, Follower's Gloves, NK Crown
[0:47:21] <DSD24> Orstein needs the red plume in the hat
[0:47:25] <federleicht> the crown might actually look good on this
[0:47:25] <subjectg> It’s way more gold in the og i think
[0:47:29] <%Ensign_Epic> yes I know that's DS3
[0:47:30] <%Prevot> @xaeveax I love it but it doesn't fit with almost any other armor pieces
[0:47:42] <%Xaeveax> Yeah the red plume helps a ton
[0:47:48] <subjectg> @nxflre it’s got that weird lighting specific coloring that arbiter’s armor had in h3
[0:47:56] <DSD24> Warrior Priest look
[0:47:58] <%CateHecate> YOU LOOK LIKE GEESE
[0:48:02] <%gitgouda> same
[0:48:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YOOOOOO
[0:48:06] <AncyentMarinere> Btw guys you can buy his armor set and the lightning paper in the sewers when you first meet him and he gives you some tips, just need to farm the souls

[0:49:35] <Treasure_Vault> now fall of
[0:49:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> this ass will be free
[0:49:40] <%Ensign_Epic> That is some pretty fucking sick Fashion Souls going on here
[0:49:49] <%CateHecate> island boi
[0:49:54] <DSD24> Boah
[0:50:01] <AvroEltz> Would be really funny if he fell right after talking a big game
[0:50:06] <%tigerfang86> huge fashion
[0:50:07] <urkleturtle> this is honestly one of the best fashion souls I've seen in 1
[0:50:09] <%Ensign_Epic> Reggarth, the Boar Knight
[0:50:13] <DSD24> I hear Arthur Morgan whenever someone says boah like that
[0:50:17] <%CateHecate> BIG spear
[0:50:23] <Darren716> Don't bother just get crystal soul spear instead
[0:50:27] <%Lion_kun> I would save up for the crystal soul spear
[0:50:29] <%CateHecate> 8 soul spears is a fuckin lot
[0:50:30] <%Ensign_Epic> @urkleturtle Unironically yeah
[0:50:32] <+vaderxyz1970> Become an artillary peice
[0:50:41] <JairusHopesItWorks> yup
[0:50:41] <%CateHecate> oh yeah at this point you may as well pump attunement for more slots
[0:50:43] <%Bread_Assassin> I’d save up for CSS.
[0:50:45] <RyuuAoi> Ew those Island Bois look like cockroaches
[0:50:50] <%Ensign_Epic> Honestly, grab both tbh
[0:50:57] <%Ensign_Epic> that is why yes
[0:50:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:51:03] <%CateHecate> web ball! reality stone!
[0:51:04] <LunarRemix> That will kill *anything* in the game
[0:51:09] <Hozak> I'm enjoying this playthrough.
[0:51:11] <%A_German_spy> spyKill
[0:51:12] <DSD24> Do some Lancer shit with those spears
[0:51:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "12 shots... this time I've got 12 shots"
[0:51:19] <Darren716> He'd need to attune more then to hold onto homing crystal
[0:51:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BRRRRR
[0:51:22] <%FallenAngelZelos> make the game a bullet hell, but you're the big ship
[0:51:25] <%RemedyofRevenge> im excited for reggie once he gets to the DLC
[0:51:29] <OblivionSword1> it's still doable
[0:51:33] <%waltzqueen> DAKKA DAKKA
[0:51:35] <Blank9> attunement for more spells is so good
[0:51:44] <%CateHecate> I LOVE THE RELOAD DURING A BATTLE
[0:51:44] <%Ensign_Epic> yeh he def wants more ATN
[0:51:47] <+Shishi1205> they stack
[0:51:47] <lord_of_the_dragons> on like new game +4 I beat super ornstein by standing behind a pillar and shooting soul spears while he shot lightning
[0:51:53] <klooswep> Revolver Ocelot, except he's a wizard
[0:52:00] <DSD24> 6 SHOTS more than enough to kill anything that moves
[0:52:07] <%theoldone001> 8 Soul Spears, more than enough to kill anything that moves.
[0:52:10] <radiorosewater> 2 levels
[0:52:11] <%Dopamien> dark bead hits were always my favorite sound in ds1
[0:52:17] <legacy0117> Dark Soulssss. ^^
[0:52:17] <Johannen> How much more they need to pump?
[0:52:32] <%Lion_kun> 2 levels you could put in int
[0:52:34] <%Ensign_Epic> @Shishi1205 Yes, but no, still need the ATN stat to equip the extra spear if he wants to keep what he has
[0:52:35] <GeoGio3> upgrading the catalyst to +14 is a good idea?
[0:52:37] <%Prevot> 2 levels
[0:52:40] <%Lion_kun> There is an attunement ring
[0:52:42] <subjectg> If he’s impatient, i think he can kill logan for a spiffy new catalyst
[0:52:44] <Blank9> 2 levels is very worth it
[0:52:49] <velgaduere> 2 is SUPER worth it
[0:52:52] <%Ensign_Epic> @GeoGio3 DS1 doesn't have catalyst upgrades
[0:52:52] <pyjama_day> worth it
[0:52:52] <Johannen> @Lion_kun But less damage thou
[0:52:53] <velgaduere> long-term investment
[0:53:00] <Treasure_Vault> Two levels seems fine. Levels are free
[0:53:01] <derap41> 3 powerful spell are plenty
[0:53:09] <LunarRemix> In regards to Catalysts finishing Logan's shop/quest gives you two of better catalysts
[0:53:12] <GeoGio3> @GeoGio3 Oh shit, didn't know that, thx
[0:53:12] <Darren716> I think getting crystal is more important atm
[0:53:12] <derap41> What else do you need but soul spears
[0:53:17] <%Lion_kun> Its better he get 44 int as fast as possible
[0:53:23] <%A_German_spy> @GeoGio3 Can't upgrade catalysts in DS1
[0:53:25] <velgaduere> bosses give like 60k now, one boss will be worth it
[0:53:30] <subjectg> He can live with 3 slots
[0:53:31] <federleicht> 50 big ones
[0:53:34] <zzNamttamzz> wearing the ring is can cover for attunement
[0:53:37] <subjectg> More NUMBER
[0:53:48] <Darren716> I say hold onto every soul item you get to pay Logan
[0:53:50] <Blank9> oh yeah, the rings for attunement slots
[0:54:11] <JairusHopesItWorks> soul spear is less than a level
[0:54:18] <%Lion_kun> How much souls does Reggie need to clean out Logan
[0:54:25] <%RemedyofRevenge> soul spear aint got shit on dark bead
[0:54:26] <pyjama_day> DLC will send him up a fair bit, no?
[0:54:29] <GHouseduivel> 173K in total @Lion_kun
[0:54:37] <%Ensign_Epic> @Lion_kun Quite a bit, considering he now has White Dragon Breath

[0:55:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> next tuesday: "so i did a little grinding offscreen"
[0:55:14] <+ElBuraindo> restart character by this point
[0:55:17] <subjectg> @ensign_epic i thought you only get that one at the very end, you didn’t have to buy it
[0:55:24] <brunoberserk> reggie looks cool
[0:55:28] <%Lion_kun> I know Woolie said to not bother but I think finishing Logans quest is super worth it for reggie
[0:55:29] <%SarcFa> I think all his current armor is non-upgradeable save for the helm which is maxed
[0:56:08] <Darren716> Yeah Logans would be super worth it
[0:56:13] <%Ensign_Epic> @subjectg Yeah, you're right
[0:56:16] <Darren716> White breath is amazing
[0:56:30] <radiorosewater> i av
[0:56:33] <radiorosewater> ihave t
[0:56:37] <~WoolieVersus> and how much time and souls would it cost to buy everything logan sells at this point?
[0:56:40] <GHouseduivel> 🔔
[0:56:41] <Treasure_Vault> Logan's quest wouldn't be worth it for nearly any other character, but for Reggie pretty neat, actually?
[0:56:42] <%Ensign_Epic> Logan quest will be good for Reggie, but let his do it in his own time
[0:56:52] <Darren716> Not too much, I think under 100k
[0:56:57] <%SarcFa> A lot of time for a situational spell is meh
[0:57:00] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus not too much time, if you grinded the forest covenant npcs
[0:57:04] <GHouseduivel> The total cost is 173k how much have you spent so far?
[0:57:04] <@Solidus_113> I'm off to watch Spiderman, so Menitta's taking over bets today. If anything goes wrong blame him
[0:57:11] <Johannen> Woolie could just grind offstream no?
[0:57:22] <RyuuAoi> Forgot I have this for the Switch. Regret not jumping in when Reggie kcked off!
[0:57:30] <%mr_sups> Fire walk with me
[0:57:32] <%Lion_kun> 170k
[0:57:35] <velgaduere> I think Reggie should be allowed to decide if he wants to or not, but I don't run the show
[0:57:35] <BlueEagle2395> there's no point in getting that catalyst, Reggie is doing just fine
[0:57:35] <LunarRemix> Goddamn Firewalker
[0:57:36] <klooswep> CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[0:57:44] <Darren716> Like half an hour of grinding in painted world with avarice would probably be enough
[0:57:47] <%JetpackMcQuack> where's the answer
[0:57:47] <%Ensign_Epic> even WITH that ring that's a pain in the ass to get
[0:57:50] <+Sir_Louis> Did we beat centipede today or was that at the end of last stream chat?
[0:57:51] <%linSP> It hurts a little :)
[0:57:55] <%Lion_kun> I agree time farming would be a drag but maybe you could do it offscreen
[0:57:55] <radiorosewater> @WoolieVersus 140, rounding up. Also hey streamer

[0:58:52] <%Invlux> It's specifically to get Miyazaki's nut off
[0:58:52] <%holydeviant1> Bone boy, if you're wondering which blacksmith for Chaos
[0:58:56] <%ThePich> CHAOS
[0:59:00] <%Ensign_Epic> @brunoberserk You need to buy his items, beyond his drops, yes
[0:59:02] <%ThePich> HATE CHAOS
[0:59:06] <Darren716> @brunoberserk only the catalyst
[0:59:08] <oak120> @brunoberserk gotta finish it to get the spell, hat and catalyst I believe
[0:59:12] <%superc37> @brunoberserk what? no, you just get his hat
[0:59:13] <LunarRemix> @brunoberserk He misses out on a catalyst + spell
[0:59:16] <subjectg> @brunoberserk he gets logan’s catalyst, but not the crystallization one or white drsgon breath
[0:59:17] <%Lion_kun> You have to finish his quest to get white breath
[0:59:18] <DSD24> "We did the area bad on purpose, as a joke"
[0:59:34] <Johannen> @brunoberserk Woolie could have easily grind for that ofscreen, but he does not care
[0:59:34] <%gitgouda> i miss trying to find where everything goes
[0:59:36] <TheProtomanBlues> Wonder how Reggie would fair in Bloodborne
[0:59:37] <%Dopamien> everything logan has is like 183k, not sure what reggie has already
[0:59:46] <radiorosewater> Skelly boy
[0:59:47] <Darren716> Reggie bought homing crystal
[0:59:59] <Johannen> They already spent like 70k on speels from him
[1:00:09] <RyuuAoi> Reggie vs BB after DS3
[1:00:13] <%Lion_kun> Honestly if you cash in bed of chaos souls you should have enough with  a little bit of grinding
[1:00:17] <subjectg> oh nvm, logan’s catalyst only appears if you complete the quest
[1:00:18] <rasamune> Nothing is older than a skeleton
[1:00:26] <%Lion_kun> B9C drops 60k right?

[1:05:07] <AganAOM> reject meat embrace calcium
[1:05:10] <%Ensign_Epic> Except Mr. Hides in Jail, since you can't kill him
[1:05:13] <subjectg> I think the blacksmith giant hammer is the only one that’s good
[1:05:14] <+ElBuraindo> like a cloud of bones?
[1:05:15] <+retro_godfather> Skeleton Warriors!
[1:05:17] <+vaderxyz1970> Terminators are inefficient death robots
[1:05:20] <radiorosewater> fuckinmg chemicals man
[1:05:24] <%Prevot> you could do anything with a skeleton, even roll them up into a giant ball
[1:05:30] <oda_flobunaga> Monsoon Skeletons
[1:05:31] <urkleturtle> don't give them ideas or they'll realize they don't need the wheels, when they can become the wheels!
[1:05:39] <blackkeep_pl> put together according to they pass belves
[1:05:50] <%Valask> Chaos elementals are usually the strongest
[1:05:56] <%Ensign_Epic> yeah the Giant Blacksmith Hammer has innate lightning
[1:06:03] <%Valask> with full humanity of course
[1:06:05] <%Ensign_Epic> @Valask Abjectly untrue.
[1:06:10] <%Valask> oh is it?
[1:06:13] <brunoberserk> Vamos is one of those npcs with zero lore , he is just there doing his job , and i love it
[1:06:13] <radiorosewater> PogChamp
[1:06:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> those are already maxed i think
[1:06:17] <%SarcFa> so they can't be upgraded
[1:06:21] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Not all armor is upgradable. Boss sets and some unique sets aren't
[1:06:23] <%SarcFa> max at +0
[1:06:24] <%Valask> of the elementals? @Ensign_Epic
[1:06:26] <%Prevot> can't upgrade all armors
[1:06:35] <+ElDragon_1> Standard maxed
[1:06:43] <urkleturtle> vamos is one of those things in ds1 that still feels VERY king's field
[1:07:07] <%bevyrage> ornstein armor can't be reinforced
[1:07:10] <subjectg> Havel’s only in ds2
[1:07:11] <morkelebmink> Black iron tarkus is the Goat
[1:07:32] <subjectg> if you could upgrade havel’s in ds1 that would be broken beyond belief
[1:07:38] <%BisoromiBear> let the man work
[1:07:41] <%Dopamien> I like that xanthous crown gets all deflated in later games
[1:07:53] <oak120> I wish to upgrade Havels shield for even more stability
[1:07:58] <MeImoth> the fact that you can't upgrade havels further is the only reason why giant armour +5 is 'better'
[1:08:06] <legacy0117> The crunchiest mic skeleton.
[1:08:07] <%Ensign_Epic> @Valask Thought you meant infusions in general. In which case, answer is still no, it IS OFTEN one of the best but not always. Lightning is arguably better due to the damage type, as an example. Chaos can have a higher AR at points, but the defenses mean often Lightning outperforms
[1:08:10] <DSD24> Giant Set after all
[1:08:11] <Treasure_Vault> Upgrading a shield to +5 is real nice for ignoring things
[1:08:21] <GiantDad2003> I love this guy
[1:08:27] <subjectg> For some reason his dialogue talks about an ember in new londo, so the flame ember must’ve been switched at some point
[1:08:36] <%Dopamien> FeelsBadMan
[1:08:40] <%Valask> heh
[1:08:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie pls
[1:08:47] <oak120> Balder Shield +15 for that monster Stability at low cost
[1:08:48] <peachy996> Vamos is looking for the button
[1:08:49] <derap41> free fire weapons  though
[1:08:51] <+king_of_mystery2> he has a cool hat woolie
[1:08:58] <peachy996> "No conversation"

[1:09:16] <brunoberserk> @subjectg  mayne he is talking about the very large ember W
[1:09:45] <subjectg> @brunoberserk i guess, but you don’t give that one to him so eh
[1:09:46] <%Ensign_Epic> @brunoberserk Yeah, that's probably what
[1:09:52] <%Valask> @Ensign_Epic aight then I stand corrected!

[1:12:24] <%RemedyofRevenge> pizza lava
[1:12:31] <urkleturtle> the glow and lazy textures make investigating pretty difficult
[1:12:31] <%Valask> my TV was super fucked and these lava levels actually fucked with my eyes
[1:12:33] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> SophiaAmoreaVeritas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Happy Holidays Woolie and Reggie! As of a couple weeks ago, I've reached Orphan of Kos. I have yet to really sit down and hammer out the fight due to work obligations but I plan to make the time. Please send good vibes. Hoping the holidays treat you well.
[1:13:00] <GiantDad2003> oh wow it's the worst part of the videogame.

[1:13:15] <Riyokuno> big butts ahead
[1:13:23] <+Lobster_Lord> its a shame how bad this area is, when the buildings look so cool
[1:13:28] <ShogunRaven> no solaire?
[1:13:28] <LunarRemix> Uh where's NPC?
[1:13:29] <%Lion_kun> uhhh
[1:13:30] <subjectg> Solaire’s only here if you go here IMMEDIATELY after beating centipede @woolieversus
[1:13:33] <nxflre> wait no Solaire?
[1:13:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> uhhhhh
[1:13:34] <%waltzqueen> Booty! Booty! Booty! Rocking Everywhere!

[1:13:50] <%Prevot> I think its fine
[1:13:52] <brunoberserk> quit reload ?
[1:13:52] <%holydeviant1> You missed him
[1:13:55] <mikesapartment> i think he only shows up right after you kill the demon
[1:13:55] <peachy996> Yesssss....
[1:13:55] <%nickdooody> dead as hell
[1:13:58] <Darren716> Daughters would be fastest
[1:14:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Uh Ho Spaggettio
[1:14:02] <conchthechimera> We bought to fight all the Drooty
[1:14:05] <@Menitta> oh no
[1:14:07] <RyuuAoi> Reggie dont read chat
[1:14:07] <%Valask> uh oh
[1:14:07] <%Prevot> probably cause reggie already entered Izalith from the other path
[1:14:12] <%theoldone001> Sunlight Maggot area
[1:14:17] <Johannen> I think they missed him in the attempt of "saving" Solaire
[1:14:17] <nxflre> sunlight aaltar bf
[1:14:19] <LunarRemix> There's a warp right there
[1:14:20] <+king_of_mystery2> should have warped to sunlight altart
[1:14:25] <subjectg> @woolieversus you didn’t fuck up his quest, but he’s only here IMMEDIATELY after beating centipede. Warping causes the quest to continue
[1:14:26] <%Ensign_Epic> Solaire should be sitting in the Sunlight Maggot Hallway, depressed but saved
[1:14:26] <%Prevot> you can warp to that bonfire
[1:14:27] <%Grimlockfly> there's a warp
[1:14:32] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You popped into the zone previously when killing bugs, that might have messed up the script
[1:14:32] <brunoberserk> sunlight altar warp
[1:14:35] <%patriotrenegade> I think he's already where the maggots are
[1:14:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> we're going the long way woo
[1:14:45] <Reveresao> if you saved him he is not there, but next the door with the head eater things
[1:14:47] <%Ensign_Epic> FYI - Solaire should be sitting in the Sunlight Maggot Hallway, depressed but saved
[1:14:47] <Treasure_Vault> TBF, that altar was probably a door in an earlier version
[1:14:52] <+Zxander93> Might be able to find Solair by where the sunlight maggot is, I think or maybe that's after bed.
[1:14:53] <conchthechimera> Did Reggie summon Solaire during O and S? I didn't get to see that fight
[1:15:00] <Cryomancer_Maurice> what sword is that?
[1:15:01] <nxflre> @conchthechimera he did
[1:15:08] <oak120> yes, but solaire didnt help much
[1:15:10] <ShogunRaven> @Cryomancer_Maurice moonlight greatsword
[1:15:11] <%holydeviant1> @Cryomancer_Maurice MLGS
[1:15:12] <subjectg> ah what does it matter, woolie only listens to spy anyway LUL
[1:15:12] <nxflre> @Cryomancer_Maurice Moonliught greatsword
[1:15:22] <conchthechimera> Mmmm but he did fulfill quest requirment
[1:15:27] <%Ensign_Epic> @Zxander93 Nope, he actually leaves that area after Bed. Only before that boss is he there.
[1:15:28] <%Dopamien> @Cryomancer_Maurice major leage gaming sword
[1:15:28] <%waltzqueen> @subjectg tbf is IS spy
[1:15:43] <Johannen> And Solaire questline ruined
[1:15:43] <Oqzar> he still in anor londo?
[1:15:46] <%holydeviant1> Solaire GONE
[1:15:47] <oneimportantthing> Woolie it's fine, he's only there before you warp
[1:15:47] <radiorosewater> hmmmmmmmmm
[1:15:48] <%Ensign_Epic> @WoolieVersus Maggot hallway
[1:15:50] <%SarcFa> Did he actually talk to him in Anor Londo?

[1:16:00] <%Bluwizard21> @WoolieVersus sunlight maggot hallway
[1:16:01] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus the person you are looking for spawns differently depending on which way you enter Lost Izalith from
[1:16:05] <%Rasheedt> @sarcfa yes
[1:16:06] <oneimportantthing> The tunnel
[1:16:07] <subjectg> @woolieversus that somebody’s only there if you beat centipede and don’t warp
[1:16:09] <GiantDad2003> The boy LIVES
[1:16:10] <%Deekman> Let's go check the maggot hallway
[1:16:10] <conchthechimera> Siegward hmmmmmm's intensifies
[1:16:12] <Rixchs> The sun must be praised
[1:16:14] <LunarRemix> It's fine Woolie. He only shows up if you go straight to Izalith after killing the Centipede demon. If you warp away he just dissapears but he *should* still be saved
[1:16:15] <%Qsmash_> did he summon solaire for the Centipede boss?
[1:16:16] <%Valask> HMMMMMMM
[1:16:17] <%Prevot> he's probably already in the bug hallway, should be fine
[1:16:20] <peachy996> Enjoying the questline hunt?
[1:16:20] <+セビー> if he’s not there, zone into izalith from shortcut door and then turn around
[1:16:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The quest should still be fine
[1:16:26] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If you're worried about what I think you're worried about, the thing you're looking for would be past the Chaos Covenant door.

[1:18:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus He only shows up past the Centipede Demon room on his "other" story path.
[1:18:59] <subjectg> I honestly think that doing the quest normally is how it should be done for first time players, all this saving bullshit is just non-organic for newbies
[1:19:06] <+askalta> he's fine
[1:19:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:19:09] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's either there or here, one or the other, but not both. You didn't miss it.
[1:19:09] <%superc37> hot take: its a better idea to not save him on the first playthrough since doing so means nothing without the context of the proper route
[1:19:11] <oneimportantthing> WOOLIE this is the one time I'll tell you to read the chat
[1:19:13] <%FallenAngelZelos> what a wonderful end to a character's questline :/
[1:19:13] <derap41> Its fine but you saved him which is nice
[1:19:25] <Darren716> You already did
[1:19:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you did
[1:19:27] <%Lion_kun> You killed his sun
[1:19:29] <Awesome_Leaf> is he still summonable?
[1:19:29] <%Bluwizard21> Sun not son
[1:19:32] <shotgang86> yeah a bug shoved up your head is not a good way to have a sun
[1:19:37] <vivaciouseff> @A_German_spy i've seen both before in the failed questline, is it different for the success?
[1:19:39] <+ArtsyFoxo> Reggie is so hurt
[1:19:39] <+ElBuraindo> JAYSUN!
[1:19:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BETTER than the alternative
[1:19:40] <%Dopamien> he needs some vitamin D supplements FeelsBadMan
[1:19:40] <+ClericOfSparda> I love Reggie. Such a good dude
[1:19:40] <%Neo_Kyon> bawkHands
[1:19:40] <urkleturtle> technically reggie did find his sun
[1:19:43] <+ArtsyFoxo> FeelsBadMan
[1:19:43] <%Invlux> BibleThump
[1:19:46] <+wmeldrum> GIMME BACK MY SUN
[1:19:47] <velgaduere> jolly co-op is OVER
[1:19:47] <Slim_Lipid> can i be his sun 👉👈🥺
[1:19:51] <peachy996> You can give him some face time with the Moonlight
[1:19:51] <%superc37> also you dont get his set or weapon from.saving him
[1:19:54] <%Grimlockfly> explain what happens to him if you sdon't save him
[1:19:54] <subjectg> @a_german_spy it’s just that there’s a very short window where he’s there, you have to beat centipede and not warp out
[1:19:57] <RyuuAoi> The sun is setting
[1:19:58] <Solidnick18> his sun FeelsBadMan
[1:19:58] <+tempestzephyr> Sun
[1:19:59] <GHouseduivel> I'll be your sun Solaire :)
[1:20:01] <emptyantics> is this the end of his questline?
[1:20:03] <derap41> and didn't find his sun
[1:20:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> here and not not here
[1:20:06] <velgaduere> Spy had some important words for you @WoolieVersus
[1:20:14] <%A_German_spy> @subjectg And not walk past the bonfire after the Centipede Demon boss room
[1:20:19] <Darren716> Yeah Woolie just say what the deal is, the quest is over
[1:20:23] <conchthechimera> All of this because he lost Dad's Van Halen mix tape
[1:20:24] <+Lobster_Lord> silly solair, the sun in the sky, not underground
[1:20:24] <RyuuAoi> Put him out his miserY Reggie
[1:20:24] <%Ensign_Epic> yeah Solaire does show up after the Centipede Demon on both versions, it's just a tiny ass window
[1:20:24] <peachy996> What does Solaire drop if you ice him?
[1:20:25] <%Qsmash_> I hear those maggots produce a good light. Maybe he'd like those.
[1:20:30] <legacy0117> At least he still alive.
[1:20:33] <+ElBuraindo> oh shit
[1:20:33] <+king_of_mystery2> @peachy996 His gear
[1:20:35] <glass_marcus> @peachy996 all his gear
[1:20:35] <%A_German_spy> @vivaciouseff How do you mean?
[1:20:40] <peachy996> Cool.
[1:20:45] <+Jaromero435> butts
[1:20:49] <Awesome_Leaf> @A_German_spy can he still summon for gwyn?
[1:20:50] <Ilkim61> yeah, let's just skip the dragonbutt area
[1:20:51] <%patriotrenegade> You have to kill ALL of them Reggie
[1:20:53] <Solidnick18> yep
[1:20:57] <%A_German_spy> @Awesome_Leaf As things currently stand? Yes.
[1:20:59] <%Dopamien> Fanta everywhere PogChamp
[1:21:01] <nxflre> @Awesome_Leaf he should be yea
[1:21:03] <oda_flobunaga> its fine
[1:21:03] <conchthechimera> Drooty Skip
[1:21:10] <iamtheTwitchghost> all good
[1:21:11] <%Ensign_Epic> This is actually the only way he is summonable for Gwyn
[1:21:11] <Awesome_Leaf> praise the sun
[1:21:14] <+Lobster_Lord> the floor is pizza
[1:21:16] <GiantDad2003> you good
[1:21:17] <%superc37> @awesome_leaf yeah, ofc he can. hes still alive after all
[1:21:20] <agustorm123> Praise the sun tho
[1:21:23] <+retro_godfather> PanicBasket it's fine!
[1:21:24] <+Jiggisnipe> butts butts butts
[1:21:26] <%Ensign_Epic> You kill him, you don't get him for the final boss lol
[1:21:29] <%tigerfang86> enter the butt zone
[1:21:30] <radiorosewater> When I was younger I remember dropping the sunlight maggot for him and not understanding why he wasn't taking it
[1:21:31] <Darren716> Woolie it's all settled now, just explain what happened
[1:21:32] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus explain to reggie what happened , you already did the thing , just for his clarification , he looks confused
[1:21:32] <GiantDad2003> Long may the sun shine.
[1:21:38] <+retro_godfather> panicBasket
[1:21:39] <vivaciouseff> @A_German_spy after beating centipede and approaching the bonfire, he'll be hanging there, lamenting his state. then when you head to the otherside of the hall he'll have found his sun
[1:21:44] <subjectg> For anyone who wants to save Solaire without using humanity, know that the drake sword 2hand r2 can reach past the door and kill the bug
[1:22:02] <subjectg> look out for anything that gives 100+ souls
[1:22:12] <%Ensign_Epic> @subjectg Really, that works too? The traditional one is poison lol, good to know
[1:22:15] <Johannen> Tragic Questline are Superior
[1:22:19] <brunoberserk> @subjectg  chaos storm also works ... sometimes LUL
[1:22:24] <RyuuAoi> Spy made this game. He knows
[1:22:25] <Puhff> no
[1:22:27] <+Shishi1205> @subjectg or the poison pyro
[1:22:35] <conchthechimera> Kay so MAYBE Drooty
[1:22:39] <%A_German_spy> @vivaciouseff Ohhhh. Okay, so the deal is, if you proceed all the way through the Centipede Demon route without opening the Chaos Covenant door and killing all of the maggots and getting the Sunlight Maggot, you get one ending of Solaire's quest
[1:22:39] <subjectg> @ensign_epic yeah i use the drake sword because it’s precise and poison mist takes too long
[1:22:39] <+retro_godfather> thats no leg WutFace
[1:22:46] <%Bluwizard21> @subjectg the hard way is to reach the backhalf and killing the red eye maggot without dying or resting after the centipede demon
[1:22:46] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:22:47] <Slim_Lipid> Try Backstab
[1:23:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> this boi fucks
[1:23:02] <%Xaeveax> @retro_godfather It's a space station
[1:23:08] <velgaduere> holy fucking damage
[1:23:10] <%Demoli_PT> i missed the start did reggie go through the sea of dinosaur ass?
[1:23:18] <%Ensign_Epic> @Bluwizard21 much respect if you did that, sounds like a literal nightmare XD

[1:23:22] <iamtheTwitchghost> ouch
[1:23:23] <%A_German_spy> @vivaciouseff Whereas if you open the chaos door FIRST, before you walk past the bonfire outside the Centipede Demon room, then get the Sunlight Maggot, you get the result that Reggie just achieved.
[1:23:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:23:24] <%Valask> you can take it zekeKEK

[1:23:49] <%holydeviant1> @Qsmash_ He's the one that respawns
[1:23:50] <RyuuAoi> Dick too big, Reggie
[1:23:53] <subjectg> He’s a very good test of your weapons though
[1:23:56] <brunoberserk> this titanite demon is the strongest of them all because he can respawn
[1:24:02] <%Valask> which covenant are we in now chat, I've lost track
[1:24:10] <subjectg> chaos servant still
[1:24:11] <%A_German_spy> @vivaciouseff The difference is, if you do it the way Reggie has, you end up getting the Sunlight Maggot first, thereby preventing Solaire from finding it
[1:24:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Valask chaos
[1:24:16] <+Shishi1205> @Valask chaos wiitch
[1:24:17] <vivaciouseff> @A_German_spy ah, it'd been a while since i'd opened the door so i assumed he still showed up at both locations, gotcha

[1:25:19] <GiantDad2003> patriarch of the titanite family master of the pole
[1:25:20] <oneimportantthing> Man, the run distances in Izalith are the worst
[1:25:21] <%A_German_spy> @vivaciouseff I think technically there might be an EXTREMELY narrow window during which you can see both, but to do that, you'd have to beat Centipede, talk to Solaire at the next bonfire, then immediately backtrack, open the chaos door, and get the Sunlight Maggot.
[1:25:29] <%Ensign_Epic> Also, these little fuckers are a way to farm Sunlight Medals offline, in case people don't know
[1:25:30] <subjectg> seriously though that dude can do crazy amounts of damage on NG+

[1:29:35] <GHouseduivel> Reggies face LUL
[1:29:35] <%Ensign_Epic> seriously though? offhand halberd is REALLY fucking strong if you know what you're doing
[1:29:38] <Johannen> I just checked Woolie's playthrou, he kills the bug first but does not enter Lost Izalith and then proceed to kill Centepide and sees a depressed Solaire
[1:29:47] <@Menitta> I'm ALWAYS down to clown.
[1:29:48] <%JetpackMcQuack> all he wanted was a shiny bug
[1:30:17] <%Bluwizard21> and hollows the fuck out
[1:30:17] <+Shishi1205> hollows out
[1:30:19] <derap41> no one else gets to take it
[1:30:25] <Slim_Lipid> he wins :)
[1:30:27] <Johannen> So Woolie made Reggie steal dreams of Laurentius and Solaire so he could just be selfish with having them around)
[1:30:27] <%CateHecate> hollows the FUCK out
[1:30:29] <+Jiggisnipe> hollows out
[1:30:32] <+eanscrale> How could you take that away from him?
[1:30:33] <+ElBuraindo> No woolie, the maggot takes over by baiting him
[1:30:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he's completed his goal, so he hollows :(
[1:30:37] <%Neo_Kyon> bawkHands
[1:30:39] <LunarRemix> Is he hollow or just crazy because of the maggot?
[1:30:43] <urkleturtle> he hollows because he no longer has a purpose
[1:30:43] <velgaduere> you saved him :)
[1:30:46] <%Valask> it's unclear
[1:30:47] <%holydeviant1> Sad or insane, no middle ground
[1:30:48] <Treasure_Vault> Or it parasites him, maybe. Who knows?
[1:30:50] <%Bluwizard21> Reggie hit it from the back and cucked solaire
[1:30:53] <%Valask> not that many hollows talk
[1:30:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> GOOD ENDING
[1:30:59] <+Jiggisnipe> @LunarRemix actually he might be crazy cuz he still talks
[1:30:59] <Grim1952> Kill his dream, save the man
[1:31:02] <gryffinp> Hey chat, remind me, can you open the door if you approach it from the sunlight maggot side without doing the covenant thing?
[1:31:04] <iamtheTwitchghost> if it were the parasite you would go crazy too
[1:31:05] <GHouseduivel> We can still help him :)
[1:31:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> never settle
[1:31:09] <RyuuAoi> Kill him before he can kill you, Reggie!!
[1:31:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @gryffinp i think so
[1:31:18] <Puhff> and that's what it means to go Hollow
[1:31:19] <gryffinp> Neat
[1:31:21] <+Shishi1205> @gryffinp no but you can cheese it and kill the maggot
[1:31:24] <oak120> this is not the way his story ends.
[1:31:27] <%CateHecate> you get what people mean when they say Dark Souls is a game about depression?
[1:31:28] <%holydeviant1> Every quest is "Kill their dreams or watch them die"
[1:31:29] <%superc37> he doesn't
[1:31:31] <AvroEltz> I think he goes hollow while also losing his faith and jolly nature, so he goes absolutely nuts
[1:31:32] <Awesome_Leaf> why cant we just be his sun BibleThump
[1:31:36] <derap41> what's worse being sad or being delusional
[1:31:40] <Johannen> @Shishi1205 He is talking about aproaching it from the other side
[1:31:43] <%A_German_spy> @gryffinp From the inside, yeah, you can.
[1:31:46] <%LastHazzerd> respect
[1:31:48] <+Shishi1205> oh yeah other side yeah
[1:31:49] <agustorm123> The sun was a maggot
[1:31:50] <%Bluwizard21> @gryffinp yes u  can open it from the back side with no covenant, you can also kill the maggot if u never die or rest between meeting him at centipede and killing the maggot
[1:31:50] <GHouseduivel> @derap41 Being delusional
[1:31:56] <%patriotrenegade> This is a much sadder ending for Solaire than killing him
[1:32:04] <+eanscrale> You don't have to kill him, you can just let him be crazy and run past him
[1:32:08] <+Jiggisnipe> remember kids, never accomplish anything
[1:32:17] <legacy0117> Hollowing turns folks undead and if they lack a sense of purpose too long they eventually go insane.
[1:32:18] <radiorosewater> just give up
[1:32:21] <%linSP> just like life
[1:32:23] <%tigerfang86> nothing matters bepWow
[1:32:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Jiggisnipe but still WANT to accomplish something
[1:32:24] <+Shishi1205> @patriotrenegade no way, if you summon him for gywn you can draw the parallel that he made it there too
[1:32:30] <yukichocomilk> miyazaki why!
[1:32:33] <Hozak> Which is why Patches lasts until the end of the world.
[1:32:35] <%JetpackMcQuack> you can do better than a maggot though friend
[1:32:36] <wawila> So me bein mediocre would mean I would never get hollowed?
[1:32:40] <+Jiggisnipe> @cobalt_phoenix_ nooooo you'll go hollow D:
[1:32:42] <%Xaeveax> There's a lot of real-world application to the concept of hollowing
[1:32:46] <+Bitscreed> Once all your dreams come true you've nothing else to strive for.
[1:32:48] <Deko_> LUL
[1:32:53] <RyuuAoi> We all go hollow one day
[1:32:54] <%holydeviant1> I like to think Solaire is the one to MAKE his own sun, if you summon him for Gwyn
[1:33:05] <%FallenAngelZelos> Always follow your dreams...JUST DON'T FULFILL THEM.
[1:33:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Jiggisnipe i thought having a goal but not achieving it is what keeps you sane tho
[1:33:10] <subjectg> The true dark souls is the moss we picked along the way
[1:33:11] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[1:33:15] <%Ensign_Epic> @patriotrenegade In a very real way? The player character is Solaire's sun, as they (are supposed to) burst into flames to Link the Flame
[1:33:21] <urkleturtle> patches will live forever because there will always be new fools to fleece
[1:33:22] <+MyooMyoo> So its about having the ambition of a King or Queen
[1:33:26] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus say hello to the demon titanite again
[1:33:28] <+Shishi1205> nvm
[1:33:34] <+Jiggisnipe> @cobalt_phoenix_ yea don't accomplish it tho, just keep chasing forever
[1:33:35] <+Berbzz> your character also goes hallow once you stop playing the game
[1:33:35] <kingra> This part has REALLY old jank
[1:33:36] <youngking_kush> Where we at bois, just got back
[1:33:37] <+Shishi1205> I mistook the area lmao
[1:33:39] <+Double_Tap_That> Fromsoft quests!
[1:33:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Jiggisnipe exactly
[1:33:50] <+NeonFishFace> oh we're in that deep dank jank i see
[1:33:51] <%A_German_spy> @holydeviant1 For what it's worth, somebody expressly asked Miyazaki that in an interview years ago, and his response was that although it's not canon ingame, he likes to imagine that Solaire goes on to link the fire in his own world after helping the player with the final boss.
[1:33:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bitrate goes BRRRRRRRRRR
[1:33:54] <%CateHecate> thats what i love about the usage of hollowing when its applied to the fucking weirdos in these games! like patches just never going hollow because he LOVES kicking people down pits
[1:33:57] <%Qsmash_> its a pretty cool flashlight
[1:34:01] <youngking_kush> Woolie hates all the quests in this game lol
[1:34:02] <oak120> would you though? Tomb of the Giants is reaaaaaal bad
[1:34:02] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus It can't be undersold how hard that is to find hidden behind 30 humanity of a secret covenant
[1:34:05] <andiwaffles> This is a hot take but the dark timeline for Solaire, even though it's mad depressing, is a very impactful moment and some good writing
[1:34:08] <Johannen> DS1 quest are the easiest, it all goes nuts only in BB and DS3
[1:34:09] <andiwaffles> 'it's so dark'
[1:34:11] <%A_German_spy> @holydeviant1 That's as close as we'll ever get to an answer.
[1:34:23] <Reveresao> BBDs incoming people Kreygasm
[1:34:24] <glass_marcus> We've arrived
[1:34:26] <%holydeviant1> @A_German_spy Yep, making his own sun to save the world. 10/10 best fucking boy
[1:34:29] <%Xaeveax> Reggie is a true hero ohlindLove
[1:34:37] <%Invlux> get ready to hear a LOT of that
[1:34:38] <zhenthrim213> WAH
[1:34:38] <%Prevot> the good thing about solaire hollowing out is you kill him and get to wear his goofy outfit
[1:34:39] <GHouseduivel> @A_German_spy That's nice.
[1:34:42] <+Shishi1205> dont
[1:34:42] <radiorosewater> it's getting dark, too dark to see
[1:34:45] <%CateHecate> goop on ya regg
[1:34:47] <AvroEltz> "I just wanted a flashlight"  "Yo robbed me of everything!!"
[1:34:47] <+cdrom321> We're not far from kazoo music and clown shoes time.
[1:34:49] <%waltzqueen> @A_German_spy Be the Sun you want to see in the world
[1:34:55] <Bedllama> I view Solaire’s good ending as foreshadowing the futility of becoming the Dark Lord. Even if you walk away, some poor chump will eventually come along to link the flame.
[1:34:56] <radiorosewater> feels like I'm knockin on heavens door
[1:34:58] <%andrewofbob> Exfoliating
[1:35:01] <%JetpackMcQuack> opens the pores
[1:35:07] <+furtive0ne> Solaire hollowing is the BIGGEST OOF
[1:35:13] <+ElBuraindo> never tried that...
[1:35:18] <%holydeviant1> This place is a "total exploration" nightmare
[1:35:19] <%CateHecate> @Bedllama cant link the fire if there aint no fire left to link ;)
[1:35:20] <+hybridfusio> I just got here, look at that alpha build
[1:35:22] <%AbnormalVoid> very quiet
[1:35:24] <andiwaffles> @radiorosewater :( it's a very morbid end to this unfound optimism he had of attaining an impossible dream
[1:35:27] <Solidnick18> uh huh
[1:35:27] <LunarRemix> This seems unfinished that's what
[1:35:33] <+Shishi1205> @Bedllama I mean he does believe in the light gods etc. He is a faith build after all
[1:35:34] <%A_German_spy> Also sems like a dead end karacoLOL
[1:35:35] <mothdude> dragon butts everywhere
[1:35:39] <+cdrom321> The topic that spawned an HOUR LONG clip of CSB.
[1:35:41] <%holydeviant1> @andiwaffles very quixotic
[1:35:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pointless ahead
[1:35:43] <%CateHecate> FWOOSHFWOOSHFWOOSHFWOOSHFWOOSH
[1:35:44] <%LastHazzerd> Boo urns
[1:35:44] <subjectg> I also feel that solaire’s bad ending is far more organic for a first playthrough and more of an impactful moment than just going through hand-holding to save an npc you barely know
[1:35:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I was saying boo-urns...
[1:35:50] <%linSP> So what is the lore on the asses
[1:35:50] <LunarRemix> You would wouldn't you. Anything.
[1:35:54] <pi_in_the_sci> Two different types of dead end
[1:35:55] <%superc37> @bedllama its not rly foreshadowing tho since the whole "someone else will come along" was entirely invented by ds2
[1:35:57] <%LastHazzerd> funny thing about development
[1:36:03] <%A_German_spy> @linSP Devs ran out of time
[1:36:08] <+Shishi1205> you see this area sucks
[1:36:09] <%Bluwizard21> watch ur health
[1:36:14] <%Valask> now Reggie can listen to the podcast!
[1:36:14] <Grim1952> Try back
[1:36:14] <oneimportantthing> Izalith is what happens when you write tour thesis the weekend before handing it in
[1:36:18] <%superc37> like foreshadowing implies what youre saying was intentional
[1:36:20] <andiwaffles> @holydeviant1 yeah exactly, kinda reminds me of Heart of Darkness
[1:36:24] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[1:36:25] <%DextralMalin> maybe

[1:45:14] <%Deekman> My theory is that the Dragon Asses are immune to lava damage, and placing any other enemies in the lava would've required Fromsoft to specifically program them to be immune

[1:46:41] <lyzejag> IT MOVED
[1:46:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The Assen One
[1:46:42] <Solidnick18> More dumpy dragon butts
[1:46:43] <mothdude> Didn't they nerf the aggro range for these things?
[1:46:44] <%LastHazzerd> like a true friend
[1:46:50] <subjectg> Alright chat pop quiz: where do you find the second great hero soul?
[1:46:52] <velgaduere> Woolie actually tatsus Reggie on the very last chest
[1:46:52] <lyzejag> The Sussy One
[1:46:54] <%holydeviant1> @mothdude Massively.
[1:46:55] <nxflre> @mothdude yup they used to all aggro
[1:46:55] <%Deekman> @pi_in_the_sci they also had a whole area of taurus demons
[1:46:56] <Mirakei> Mimic Friends
[1:46:57] <thelivingglitch307> they don't notice things well
[1:46:57] <RyuuAoi> Thank you , Wooliw
[1:46:57] <Marhunter7> @WoolieVersus nah, we still have more mimics in DS2
[1:47:05] <youngking_kush> Champion of Ass
[1:47:05] <%Xaeveax> @subjectg Within Reggarth
[1:47:11] <emptyantics> Has Reggie made his BED yet?
[1:47:12] <+Shishi1205> @mothdude maybe? I thought they always had an abysmal agro range
[1:47:15] <+Malysitos> I guess Reggie forgot that the acquiring the Symbol of Avarice means he got all the mimics
[1:47:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:47:17] <subjectg> @xaeveax i’ll allow it!
[1:47:17] <radiorosewater> @subjectg Above Majula?
[1:47:33] <pi_in_the_sci> @Deekman It suggests to me that lava immunity is a switch that is very easy to turn on and off
[1:47:33] <%CateHecate> @Malysitos shh, dont remind him, let the fear linger
[1:47:40] <oda_flobunaga> What if this was filled with generic Quellag spiders instead
[1:48:01] <kulmoth> this area just sears my eyeballs
[1:48:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @oda_flobunaga as long as they got booba im all good
[1:48:09] <peachy996> it ends up being emptier
[1:48:10] <%CateHecate> gee i wonder why this city is so lost it seems great :)
[1:48:23] <%Irridium> should've stayed lost
[1:48:24] <youngking_kush> It should've just been a bunch of Evillacs down here
[1:48:27] <peachy996> that fat dragon asses take up enough space to make it seem more real.
[1:48:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This place used to be so much worse
[1:48:31] <%CateHecate> Lost Evillak
[1:48:32] <Reveresao> checkout the tower NotLikeThis
[1:48:33] <+king_of_mystery2> @mothdude I think unpatched they like all aggro as soon as you enter the zone

[1:48:45] <Darren716> Shit there's items in this area?
[1:48:47] <derap41> The loot no one gets

[1:48:52] <%theoldone001> I remember when they used to aggro from father away
[1:48:54] <zhenthrim213> witches like to copy paste
[1:48:54] <radiorosewater> Los Izalith
[1:48:57] <lyzejag> There's items in this area ????????
[1:48:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait how do the items not burn in lava
[1:48:59] <oak120> @Darren716 nothing good.
[1:49:00] <+Brizzo24> Damn girl you got that ceaseless discharge
[1:49:00] <Solidnick18> get down with the thiccness
[1:49:02] <%Xaeveax> @Darren716 Nothing meaningful in this lava area I think
[1:49:06] <+Malysitos> There’s no way Reggie’s gonna crush BoC in one go, there’s just no way. I refuse to believe
[1:49:06] <+warlockwithapixie> Nobody has ever seen those items before.
[1:49:06] <+Shishi1205> @derap41 I got it the first play through i did

[1:49:54] <+Jiggisnipe> and it used to be eye searing bright LUL
[1:49:56] <%Prevot> and this lava damages your armor over time too btw
[1:49:57] <%theoldone001> Doesn't the Lava damage equipment too?
[1:49:58] <dalmek> they should make the noise worse. Just make each lava hit be the Prim Stone scream
[1:49:58] <oda_flobunaga> Maybe someone should change the noise to a goat scream
[1:49:58] <lyzejag> DON'T CARE DIDN'T ASK
[1:50:03] <%CateHecate> Everything is very hot and there are giant asses in Los Izalith
[1:50:04] <Mirakei> Izalith tried to recreate the original twerk
[1:50:08] <Carlioo> hey we can't see clearly either
[1:50:08] <+Shishi1205> @Jiggisnipe bro it was so bad
[1:50:08] <subjectg> Level design like you’re a 12 yr old boy who just found the Black Hawk Down mission editor tool

[1:50:28] <%Lion_kun> WE DIDN'T GET PROPER TUTORIALS TILL SEKIRO
[1:50:28] <%Deekman> too busy staring at the assess
[1:50:33] <alroy909> its such a shame, because a lava sea with black charred ziggurats and temples and demonic roots is an awesome design for a fire zone.
[1:50:33] <radiorosewater> he was scootin
[1:50:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[1:50:37] <peachy996> technically this is a swamp

[1:50:42] <+Shishi1205> @Invlux big masochist ass miyazaki
[1:50:45] <oda_flobunaga> Or maybe constant Wilhelm screams
[1:50:47] <Reveresao> look at the tower its right there reggie......
[1:50:49] <peachy996> it has all the makings of a fromsoft swamp
[1:50:52] <LunarRemix> Original Dark Souls also had a even worse orange lava
[1:50:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pain
[1:50:56] <%Deekman> Reggie too busy staring at the asses can't see the ballbags in front of him
[1:50:57] <Darren716> Oh God please get the bonfire
[1:51:04] <%CateHecate> also the fact that these models are literally a retextured and janked-up version of the Asylum Demon model with no walk cycle LUL
[1:51:09] <+tnomads> this zone smells like Tang

[1:52:30] <%AbnormalVoid> you

[1:52:37] <Reveresao> Thank you
[1:52:38] <conchthechimera> crisis averted he found it bois
[1:52:39] <Mirakei> That dragon from Paper Mario TTYD that serves peoples feet fetish would probably love Lost Izalith.
[1:52:39] <emptyantics> @linsp imo the WORST fromsoft area
[1:52:39] <velgaduere> now you can more easily elimate all dragon ass
[1:52:41] <radiorosewater> you defeated
[1:52:42] <+Shishi1205> @Jiggisnipe Actually he likes being killed. H enjoys being cursed too. Its all for him
[1:52:42] <velgaduere> *eliminate
[1:52:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @linSP only area i straight up said "nah fuck this shit" and left
[1:52:47] <LunarRemix> Plenty of people finish this whole area without ever finding this Bonfire
[1:52:48] <+Shishi1205> @Irridium LUL
[1:52:48] <vivaciouseff> @oneimportantthing someone's forgotten about horsefuck valley and the other three god awful DLC areas
[1:52:51] <%A_German_spy> @Irridium Part of the troll that this entire area is.
[1:52:52] <+Jiggisnipe> @Darren716 he has said he glances down sometimes
[1:52:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fast Shortcut to Drussy
[1:52:54] <%theoldone001> I like how someone always asks there's a bonfire here?! Yes. There is lol
[1:53:14] <%Deekman> why do we go emote only sometimes? Reggie can't see chat
[1:53:17] <legacy0117> Gotta clap Reggarth. It’s only way to defeat the dragoness ***.
[1:53:19] <%Irridium> So this is how those people who didn't find the sens fortress bonfire felt
[1:53:23] <Solidnick18> that dragon wants it
[1:53:23] <%Xaeveax> @Deekman He can
[1:53:26] <+Shishi1205> @Deekman he has it near
[1:53:30] <youngking_kush> @deekman Hr can
[1:53:33] <subjectg> @vivaciouseff at least those have the justification of being low-effort challenge maps for coop, this is a major area!
[1:53:35] <oneimportantthing> Is horsefuck valley the canon name now lol i totally forgot
[1:53:35] <%Deekman> @Deekman news to me lol
[1:53:51] <velgaduere> @Deekman Woolie has confirmed it
[1:53:52] <Marhunter7> Its amazing watching the stream just try and die every time reggie steps into the lava because of how absurd the bloom effect is.
[1:53:55] <+Shishi1205> @Irridium one of the two most obscure ones with the one behind the illusory wall in the catacombs

[1:55:07] <Marhunter7> @cobalt_phoenix_ wasn't it functionally infinite for the zone?
[1:55:07] <youngking_kush> "Fight this fuckin Dragon ass in this fuckin lava you fuck" - Miyazaki
[1:55:12] <%Prevot> so from best to worst I'd say Londo > Dukes > Tomb > Izalith
[1:55:13] <+Shishi1205> @cobalt_phoenix_ I know they use to go bonkers when you were on that bonfire
[1:55:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I don't know if Woolie ever saw this area with the old aggro range
[1:55:24] <AnonymousNate_> Miyazaki actually had little to do with the development of this area... He said in an interview when he saw what they did with it he just made the best with what they had admitting this was the worst area of the game
[1:55:24] <%Bluwizard21> I would love to see them flesh out giants archstone and  the end game of dark souls to what they had envisioned originally
[1:55:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ idk exactly but i hear it was WAY bigger
[1:55:40] <%holydeviant1> @cobalt_phoenix_ IIRC it was almost zone-wide
[1:55:59] <peachy996> woshwoshwoshwoshwosh

[1:58:55] <zhenthrim213> @dalmek soul of nobody
[1:58:56] <Solidnick18> just alot of dragon asses
[1:58:58] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's a shame because the temples look cool, but fuck the eye searing lava
[1:59:01] <%theoldone001> You can aggro them from up there with arrows, pull multiple of them over and have them kill each other
[1:59:01] <+Shishi1205> big lasagna looking ass zone
[1:59:02] <%Dopamien> @dalmek hey thats me PogChamp
[1:59:03] <klooswep> Soul of a Corpse (empty)
[1:59:08] <%mr_sups> This Zone would be great in a BluePoint style Remake. Not much you could do in a Remaster.
[1:59:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is this as far down as the world goes or is ash lake lower?
[1:59:22] <+Shishi1205> @cobalt_phoenix_ lower?
[1:59:25] <youngking_kush> Soul of a Corpse Nothing
[1:59:33] <%A_German_spy> @cobalt_phoenix_ Ash Lake is the lowest point
[1:59:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ deeper
[1:59:34] <Johannen> @Awesome_Leaf I think you can, there are just branches to climb but why would you is the question
[1:59:36] <available_line> I think the bed is lowest, lower than ash lake
[1:59:38] <+king_of_mystery2> Does woolie know about the illusory wall, or still remember ?
[1:59:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ty spy
[1:59:59] <%A_German_spy> @cobalt_phoenix_ spyServed
[2:00:00] <LunarRemix> @mr_sups I'd say Izalith and the Catacombs would benefit the most from a remake, including from a lore stand-poing where Nito kind of does nothing and isn't involved in anything
[2:00:01] <klooswep> I thought that the Abyss was technically the lowest
[2:00:10] <Johannen> You can see Ash Lake from the Tomb of Giants so not sure
[2:00:11] <AnonymousNate_> Fun fact in the original version of Dark Souls there were even more of those half dragons and the fire was way brighter. So believe it or not this place used to be worse than it is now
[2:00:19] <emptyantics> Abyss is another world
[2:00:33] <zhenthrim213> does it?
[2:00:38] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen If I remember correctly, the view of Ash Lake from the Tomb of Giants is an illusion. They don't line up exactly.
[2:00:39] <Awesome_Leaf> @Johannen lol no good reason, thats for sure
[2:00:50] <peachy996> prude
[2:01:00] <youngking_kush> Reggie is in to Dragon ass, confirmed
[2:01:00] <%Ensign_Epic> @A_German_spy Yeah, illusory wall has a video on it, I think
[2:01:01] <Johannen> @A_German_spy So its a Dev Lie or like in universe lie?
[2:01:01] <DSD24> But not really tho
[2:01:02] <+Shishi1205> is it an actual zone?
[2:01:08] <%spaghettiweaver> @peachy996 pervert
[2:01:09] <+Shishi1205> Im not so sure about that
[2:01:12] <mothdude> A zone that still isn't great but at least isn't torture
[2:01:15] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen Dev lie.
[2:01:15] <subjectg> “Zone”

[2:01:25] <LunarRemix> Because we ran out of models
[2:01:28] <%A_German_spy> @Ensign_Epic He might, yeah
[2:01:30] <dalmek> we built statues of these freak creatures. as a joke
[2:01:33] <%Juriasu> yeah why make a statue out of something that already is a statue
[2:01:34] <%mr_sups> Zone Bad
[2:01:35] <%Prevot> real question: WHY DO THE STATUES BREATHE
[2:01:36] <$oFlooofy> to fuck with you LUL as a goof
[2:01:37] <+king_of_mystery2> When you use chameleon in this area you turn into one of those statue enemies
[2:01:42] <legacy0117> They might be a big Woolie, but you get used to it.

[2:02:05] <Solidnick18> all that i see
[2:02:08] <pi_in_the_sci> This city is made out of dragon stuff, and dragon stuff makes things alive sometimes
[2:02:08] <Johannen> @A_German_spy I didnt thought of it as actual Ash lake area but the bottom of the world, it does go on forever right?
[2:02:09] <%amaranthos> have we gotten to the dragon butts yet
[2:02:22] <kvassimoto> dragon butts are behind us
[2:02:23] <thelivingglitch307> just passed dragon ass

[2:03:09] <+esoteric_simp> sekiro?
[2:03:09] <TheAntiNihilist> skip DS2 tho
[2:03:10] <28moogles> Is Reggie gonna play DS2 and BB on stream? I haven't caught every episode so I might have missed the answer.

[2:03:22] <emptyantics> CANT WAIT FOR BLOODBORNE
[2:03:22] <RyuuAoi> You're  gonna LOVE Bloodborne,Reggie!
[2:03:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The fact he's saying that here of all things means Reggie REALLY loves it
[2:03:23] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> DS2 Reggie WHEN
[2:03:24] <%Xaeveax> Gotta go in release order.
[2:03:24] <glass_marcus> Before Izalith, Reggie was pretty mid on Darksouls, But now he's IN

[2:03:33] <+Shishi1205> Reggie is gonna grossed out by the octopus for sure
[2:03:36] <%X2Eliah> secrets? in the least-finished, most rushed area of the game?
[2:03:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fair point reggie
[2:03:38] <GHouseduivel> Reggie loves swinging
[2:03:42] <urkleturtle> once you're past the give up point in your first one, these games have you hooked forever
[2:03:43] <oneimportantthing> Omg we're getting to the good stuff
[2:03:44] <atomizedstream> you can kick
[2:03:45] <emptyantics> DS2 hype!!
[2:03:46] <%spaghettiweaver> I replayed ds2 recently I forgot how much it sucked
[2:03:47] <%Juriasu> Reggie is so happy right now, would be a shame if something coming up soon would change that Kappa
[2:03:50] <+Brizzo24> should play bloodborne before ds3 to see what they learned
[2:03:52] <subjectg> You can roll through SOME walls in this game
[2:03:52] <conchthechimera> inb4 pizza eyeball demon
[2:03:53] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen Well, the view from the Tomb of Giants is partly meant as a hint to Ash Lake's existence, and partly meant as environmental lore to give you some idea of how far down the Tomb is supposed to be
[2:03:54] <peachy996> Lost Izalith made Reggie fall in love with Souls
[2:03:55] <youngking_kush> The streets need WoolieVS Elden Ring
[2:03:55] <+Shishi1205> TIME FOR TENTACLES
[2:03:55] <AvroEltz> Play ds2, say "You know what i mean?" more time then Pat challenge
[2:03:56] <RyuuAoi> Woolie being hypocrite  ha LET HIM SWING
[2:04:00] <28moogles> The DS2 hate in this chat is sad. DS2 rules.
[2:04:01] <%Dopamien> ds2 I made it more than halfway before I realized you had to 'activate' illusions
[2:04:03] <GeoGio3> he does not see it

[2:04:11] <+vaderxyz1970> Whats it agro range?
[2:04:18] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen But yeah, in-universe, Ash Lake is based on the Norse concept of Yggdrasil, the World-Tree.

[2:05:18] <LunarRemix> They had the model lying around and tossed it in here
[2:05:19] <%Valask> define alien, everything in this fucking place is a weird bug
[2:05:19] <emptyantics> In my head canon that thing is an alien lol
[2:05:24] <TheAntiNihilist> CHAOS
[2:05:25] <available_line> Straight out of FF7
[2:05:26] <%justcallmebobplease> It DOES look like Ebrietas would give it a hug, doesn't it.
[2:05:28] <AnonymousNate_> Best grab attack in the series though
[2:05:29] <%holydeviant1> Just stonefaced lifting the sorcery catalyst to kill it
[2:05:30] <%Hapsam> you should have seen the eyes on reggie seeing that
[2:05:30] <+cdrom321> @hax_metatron I think it's cute. It's like an evil, chaotic vacuum cleaner.
[2:05:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> Izalith is fucked up
[2:05:32] <oneimportantthing> ... speed ....
[2:05:35] <Treasure_Vault> Might fit the end of the dlc
[2:05:39] <Johannen> @A_German_spy Realy? I thought it was more alined with Nausicua Forest and world of the dead
[2:05:41] <RyuuAoi> Looks like Hell
[2:05:41] <LVL1_Scumbag> Those witches were into some weird shit
[2:05:42] <+Shishi1205> pyro time bby
[2:05:44] <%justcallmebobplease> Or like an Amygdala would get its hair done sticking its head in the orifice.
[2:05:46] <youngking_kush> That's a Bloodborne
[2:05:48] <JairusHopesItWorks> I like to think chaos is just messed up
[2:05:50] <28moogles> @28moogles Jank hitboxes, sure. Also amazing level design, boss fights, best story and exploration, etc. Pros far outweigh the cons. Also subverts the first game, best sequel since MGS2. :)
[2:06:04] <%SaintBeau> did he find the secret bonfire?
[2:06:10] <Darren716> Oh fuck this upcoming drop
[2:06:11] <%ozzrabbit> If you think about it, aren’t demons and aliens essentially the same thing?
[2:06:11] <velgaduere> it is time to get VERY lost
[2:06:13] <%Xaeveax> Hopefully he finds "the room"
[2:06:14] <%holydeviant1> Like, you can sort of assume the Demons were made from people in Izalith, sure, but wherefrom the Chaos Eaters, they make NO SENSE
[2:06:16] <klooswep> The skybox in Izalith does look pretty sweet, one of the few things I like about the area
[2:06:17] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen There are possible parallels there too. Fromsoft draws from all sorts of different mythologies for their games, as do many other devs.
[2:06:25] <%Juriasu> I hate getting that thing on the ledge
[2:06:28] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Joh
[2:06:30] <available_line> an hero

[2:06:32] <klooswep> @Xaeveax Oh hi Mark
[2:06:33] <Johannen> @A_German_spy I guess in Elden Ring they are getting there Giant Tree Boners out
[2:06:35] <%ThePich> do you feel like a hero?

[2:13:11] <%TreeLeafBoi> Damn
[2:13:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> Sieg is a cool dude
[2:13:11] <%undersea_magic> try sniping
[2:13:11] <subjectg> At the very least he didn’t fuck it up as hard as woolie did LUL
[2:13:12] <VincentGraves> you have to kill all but one to get through it easily
[2:13:14] <+tnomads> high stakes gameplay
[2:13:14] <%FallenAngelZelos> the worst part is that he can survive and STILL die if he takes enough damage. So bull.
[2:13:14] <%superc37> did that count as complete tho? if he died before anything could happen to sieg?
[2:13:14] <peachy996> I dunno about Woolie but I feel pretty good
[2:13:18] <Pyrrhus90> cant save everyone i guess
[2:13:19] <+Shishi1205> worst quest design in ds1
[2:13:20] <%baka_sugoi> RISK GUAGE FULL
[2:13:23] <%atlasdotwav> Hey onion just didn’t git gud
[2:13:26] <oneimportantthing> At least you didn't backstab him
[2:13:26] <%Bluwizard21> ya kill all but one before talking to him and its easy as sin
[2:13:26] <Reveresao> You can kill all of them except for one, talk to him, then kill the last one
[2:13:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> tell him the rest of his story woolie
[2:13:30] <youngking_kush> RIP slab
[2:13:31] <%AceNugget> jumped in with the dokepon pet covering him
[2:13:32] <Treasure_Vault> Tell him all the quest bullshit
[2:13:36] <%MrATheGreat> I haven't seen anyone fail that actually damn
[2:13:36] <legacy0117> At Solaire is alive.
[2:13:37] <Darren716> Wait so Reggie didn't get any of the rewards for that quest now?
[2:13:39] <RyuuAoi> Mario World death theme plays
[2:13:41] <%linSP> the devs were assholes here, it’s too hard to take four on
[2:13:42] <TheAntiNihilist> not true but suture woolie
[2:13:45] <%Charronia> RIP Siegmeyer, you made a good effort naroSalute
[2:13:46] <Riyokuno> this is the worst part
[2:13:47] <%swesterly> No  I think sine Reggie died he might be fine
[2:13:56] <youngking_kush> You could easily saved him
[2:14:02] <%holydeviant1> If it makes Reggie feel any better, Seigmeyer's kingdom (Catarina) is one of the few to make it all the way through the series. Most other kingdoms fall into obscurity at some point.
[2:14:07] <%Valask> it's so stupid
[2:14:09] <%swesterly> Sieg needs to fight one though
[2:14:16] <%Qsmash_> Lost Izalith killing all of your friends
[2:14:20] <youngking_kush> You can kill all but 1 of them
[2:14:23] <%SaintBeau> more than halg
[2:14:23] <brunoberserk> is okay , reggie , fell people finishes this sidequest anyway , probably i dont know 10% of DS1 players
[2:14:27] <%SaintBeau> more than half
[2:14:27] <LunarRemix> If he survives with less tham 50% he just naps on the spot
[2:14:29] <SoaringTrumpet> it's very difficult to complete, especially going in blind
[2:14:31] <Johannen> Easily done on subsequent playthous like most quests
[2:14:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> The conditions are fucky
[2:14:33] <%linSP> you have to let him get a kill
[2:14:36] <+Shishi1205> he needs +50%
[2:14:38] <subjectg> @woolieversus it’s the reverse woolie, you made this mistake last time, more than half he continues on, less he dies
[2:14:43] <Darren716> I always try to leave one but it ends up falling in a hole
[2:14:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You're correct. Under 50% he dies after the fight; over 50% he makes it to the next leg. But if you kill all four monsters before talking to him, his quest just ends there.
[2:15:03] <%SaintBeau> he has to have a part in the fight, but he has to have more than half health
[2:15:05] <emptyantics> Its bullshit is what it is
[2:15:07] <%justcallmebobplease> The only 'too much help' you can do is if you kill all the monsters before he jumps in, which Woolie remembered.
[2:15:16] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Exactly so.
[2:15:16] <%swesterly> Isn’t there still a chance since Reggie died
[2:15:17] <Riyokuno> but he died so quickly LUL
[2:15:24] <%atlasdotwav> U can’t save everybody
[2:15:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:15:28] <NaberiustheNefarious> its alot of damn work
[2:15:31] <%Lion_kun> The Sieg quest in DS3 is so much better
[2:15:33] <VincentGraves> having a bow makes this quest easy
[2:15:34] <%Valask> really depressing scene, that
[2:15:35] <lord_of_the_dragons> meeting LUL
[2:15:36] <SoaringTrumpet> BibleThump
[2:15:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> "meeting up"
[2:15:41] <velgaduere> he hollows because he feels useless
[2:15:42] <LVL1_Scumbag> But you get a SLAB
[2:15:44] <+Shishi1205> @Lion_kun the end at least
[2:15:44] <%RemedyofRevenge> Go tell his daughter
[2:15:46] <Awesome_Leaf> that chunk tho
[2:15:46] <Mundkipz> SLAB
[2:15:48] <derap41> Reggie still think he can save people LUL
[2:15:48] <KingOmnicide> "meeting" LUL
[2:15:50] <+Jiggisnipe> I like Woolie's choice of words Kappa
[2:15:51] <Awesome_Leaf> slab
[2:15:51] <youngking_kush> You just kill all but 1 and then let him get a swing on the last one
[2:15:54] <%linSP> Big ass slab
[2:15:59] <%Valask> he's doomed
[2:16:04] <Mundkipz> Slab of onion
[2:16:09] <subjectg> Funnily enough, i completed this legit recently because sieg got command grabbed and didn’t get mobbed by all the others LUL
[2:16:11] <velgaduere> don't they fight and you have to save her?
[2:16:11] <zzNamttamzz> She kills him BibleThump
[2:16:13] <%Valask> he died in battle, so yay?
[2:16:17] <resloxxx> no happy endings in souls games
[2:16:17] <youngking_kush> And you get a Slab at the end
[2:16:17] <atomizedstream> @woolieversus he died a warriors death
[2:16:22] <peachy996> I have never understood people screaming to save these two because they'll die anyway and there's no stopping it
[2:16:24] <+PkSilent01> Did I miss it, did he save him?
[2:16:27] <+Shishi1205> she puts him down yes
[2:16:29] <velgaduere> he died the death he wanted to
[2:16:33] <%Deekman> you were close, just said No instead of Yes
[2:16:36] <Awesome_Leaf> BibleThump
[2:16:37] <brunoberserk> i remember in one my tries in this quest  , a monster grabbed sieg and INSTA KILLED HIM , so yes :FUCK THIS QUEST

[2:16:54] <subjectg> @peachy996 you get a slab at the end of it, and miyazaki HATES giving you slabs

[2:17:08] <NaberiustheNefarious> everyone dies a childrens story for grownups
[2:17:11] <%SaintBeau> at least he didn't get THAT ending for Solaire jermaPluto
[2:17:18] <Darren716> I somehow got it on my first play through, I've never got it since
[2:17:21] <emptyantics> @saintbeau :( :( :(
[2:17:29] <VincentGraves> just use a bow to get the last one with low health
[2:17:29] <+Shishi1205> bow cheese
[2:17:30] <%swesterly> There once was an ugly barnacle
[2:17:32] <%Qsmash_> I shot projectiles before I dove in. Helped a ton.
[2:17:35] <nxflre> yup cheesee with poison
[2:17:39] <youngking_kush> You dont have to do all that shit Pat was talking about lol
[2:17:42] <%Valask> Izalith is where everyone you love dies zekePEPE
[2:17:42] <subjectg> Honestly i think reggie getting solaire’s bad end would’ve been excellent content after that
[2:17:53] <Nevarato> has Reggie bought a second copy of soul spear from the apprentice?
[2:17:56] <%Prevot> you can poison arrow 3 of them and that makes it doable
[2:17:59] <%Seancicle> woolieSTRIKE
[2:18:00] <+Shishi1205> @Nevarato no
[2:18:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Nevarato not yet
[2:18:18] <%atlasdotwav> It’s a NG+ plotline
[2:18:21] <klooswep> Solaire is just "This is the end... unless you basically 100% the game beforehand"
[2:18:22] <Johannen> @subjectg Yes, that is a intended way i feel, most quests end Tragicly after all
[2:18:26] <youngking_kush> Yeah, you're meant to save Solaire on NG+
[2:18:26] <sporeian94> the one bug that kills solaire gives more souls so that's how you know he's saved
[2:18:32] <%mr_sups> Obtuse
[2:18:32] <KaiserMario> You need to collect the hat tho, or it doesn't work?
[2:18:32] <%FallenAngelZelos> see this type of obtuseness is the souls' series greatest flaws. And it's a "feature".
[2:18:32] <NaberiustheNefarious> grind rats for humanity requirement if you really want it
[2:18:33] <TheAntiNihilist> OR just kill the bug right after the centipede fight...
[2:18:47] <velgaduere> it's okay Reggie, this was the good end
[2:18:56] <blackphilosopher420> Which one does he like more so far: Demon’s Soul or Dark Souls? @woolieversus
[2:18:57] <Mitchellsocks> For Solaire, if you skip his anor londo dialogue, you can kill sunlight maggot manually then resume his quest
[2:19:01] <%SaintBeau> i wish more people would play out the QL for solaire, you're supposed to not know how to save him. having to kill him is such a powerful moment jermaPluto
[2:19:09] <+Shishi1205> save scum if you need to save the boy
[2:19:12] <trench2nowhere> at least get his shit
[2:19:16] <velgaduere> onion soup doodSad
[2:19:20] <%fat_burtreynolds> Kinky
[2:19:21] <%atlasdotwav> A weapon broke didn’t it?
[2:19:28] <%justcallmebobplease> I'd argue him getting to die trying to help his savior in an adventure that went farther than he thought it could, is much better than Hollowing out.
[2:19:30] <subjectg> They repaired the pyro glove
[2:19:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @atlasdotwav fixed it
[2:19:37] <emptyantics> RIP my sweet onion knight :(
[2:19:43] <+BottledLineArt> "It's tragic" could describe most of these game's stories.
[2:19:45] <urkleturtle> boy the npc questlines in elden ring are going to be such utter horseshit
[2:19:46] <+Shishi1205> without dying to the titanite demon too
[2:19:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Well most questlines end tragicly and "saving" people is not in the spirit of DS story
[2:19:51] <%justcallmebobplease> Siegmeyer dying in that fight in the pit is as close to a good end as he could hope for here, IMO
[2:19:54] <%SaintBeau> @Johannen this
[2:19:55] <Mitchellsocks> Yeah this is def the "good" ending for Siggy Sadge
[2:19:59] <sporeian94> just enter the covenant and farm humanity from the rats!
[2:20:04] <+Jaromero435> Dark Souls: Shit's fucked
[2:20:05] <%swesterly> Again, Reggie died fast Sieg might be fine lol

[2:21:12] <%swesterly> Yo Reggie died so fast Sieg might be fine idk worth checking at least
[2:21:14] <%spaghettiweaver> is his daughter still in ash lake waiting for you if he dies here?
[2:21:17] <%theoldone001> The more you come back to this zone the worse it gets lol
[2:21:25] <Johannen> @swesterly Might be true
[2:21:26] <%atlasdotwav> next time on z-fighters
[2:21:28] <AvroEltz> EVERYTHING, in this area is just sadness and despair, the bosses, the quests, the lore, all of it sucks

[2:22:59] <conchthechimera> home again home again jiggity jig
[2:22:59] <velgaduere> it's okay, he left a vidalia onion behind

[2:23:02] <subjectg> otherwise boss weapons would be even more worthless
[2:23:03] <peachy996> Yup
[2:23:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> don't worry he animorphs into a pot
[2:23:07] <+Shishi1205> and the strongest one
[2:23:08] <%justcallmebobplease> For farming purposes.
[2:23:16] <%fat_burtreynolds> He’ll peel your onion csbeastA csbeastS csbeastS

[2:39:48] <+Shishi1205> He is the best npc for int builds
[2:39:50] <+vaderxyz1970> With the magic of CE you can get a loan of 200000 souls....
[2:39:55] <emptyantics> @grimlockfly Yep
[2:40:02] <Hozak> Gonnna get your shiny sword all poopy
[2:40:02] <ShogunRaven> @Grimlockfly Logan's catalyst is the single best catalyst in the game xD
[2:40:06] <Raldavar> Time to go nuke Phalnx 2.0 for 10 mins
[2:40:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> wow I don't remember boulder boys being so tanky
[2:40:10] <youngking_kush> It's not even cancerous, it's just the thing you should do for an INT build lol

[2:40:42] <NumbF4ke> What spell did you get for finishing logans quest?
[2:40:45] <+Shishi1205> bc Reggie is going full int with the mlgs those spells + the catalyst are his endgame
[2:41:05] <Raldavar> Serious he has the build to farm the 200k souls in the time it takes to drink a cup of tea
[2:41:09] <%theoldone001> I don't get the hangup on it, either he wants it or not. It's only brought up cause Reggie has been asking for a new catalyst and he's an Int build.

[2:42:47] <urkleturtle> i think when people are talking like you HAVE to do logan's questline, they think of their playthrough where they planned on building high INT from the start with a guide instead of putting 27 points into STR like reggie because he couldn't be sure where he would be going
[2:42:53] <emptyantics> BEST BOSSFIGHT
[2:42:56] <%SaintBeau> one more daughter, then the Witch herself

[2:43:10] <+Shishi1205> @urkleturtle With his weapon now he is build int regardless
[2:43:12] <%AceNugget> year 1000 of being a seething discharge
[2:43:18] <+cdrom321> @Wofoeh Dead.
[2:43:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT A HERO
[2:43:20] <+Shishi1205> @Wofoeh gone
[2:43:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> long. live. the king
[2:43:25] <subjectg> @wofoeh poochie died on his way back to his home planet
[2:43:36] <Johannen> @urkleturtle That's more on Woolie's desire to push him into using weapons more and not knowing the str did nothing for added damage on the Pole
[2:43:45] <%Prevot> if your discharge continues on for a whole millennia please see a doctor
[2:43:51] <Wofoeh> F
[2:43:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:43:53] <+cdrom321> @Wofoeh He killed her so fast that he didn't get to see the sadness.
[2:44:01] <+Shishi1205> @Johannen it did increase, not by much tho
[2:44:06] <LunarRemix> Pyromancy's strength is at the start of the game, it doesn't scale as well by the later game
[2:44:23] <shotgang86> man Pyro really had to be nerfed to scale like hex in DS2. You just needing materials to upgrade it made it super broken
[2:44:24] <Hozak> Let's go visit crazy hat Logan
[2:44:25] <urkleturtle> @urkleturtle and quite a few levels too deep to afford to be spending these souls on the quest without massive grinding
[2:44:43] <+Shishi1205> @LunarRemix I mean you need souls to upgrade it
[2:44:51] <%Prevot> pyromancy is a way too big money sink, not worth it at all
[2:44:54] <Johannen> @shinichizio Yeah and pumping Int would have been better, thats it excatly
[2:45:10] <JairusHopesItWorks> only apprentice sells extra soul spear
[2:45:17] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I agree.
[2:45:23] <%Grimlockfly> @Prevot it's good, but if you're rolling Moonlight Greatsword/ super int, it's not worth his time
[2:45:23] <subjectg> pyromancy is an excellent option for someone who doesn’t have int or faith, firestorm is great to have for any build
[2:45:24] <shotgang86> Halfway through the game money is not an issue
[2:45:29] <Johannen> He could get another Soul Spear if he wanted to
[2:45:36] <shotgang86> unless its to level up
[2:45:39] <%tigerfang86> ew
[2:45:39] <+Shishi1205> Pyro is good for a "stupid" char
[2:45:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ok
[2:45:44] <+Shishi1205> like low int
[2:45:45] <%Vigonept> what reggie
[2:45:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[2:45:45] <SilverFaustX> AngelThump
[2:45:45] <+BottledLineArt> no1S
[2:45:46] <subjectg> If you do have int or faith it’s much better to build for those stats
[2:45:46] <derap41> LUL
[2:45:46] <+Shishi1205> low faith
[2:45:52] <lord_of_the_dragons> queelag you've been smoking ganja again
[2:45:53] <%theoldone001> Reggie will probably dabble in Dark Magic later on anyways so Manus Catalyst is still an option but that's the end of the game at that point.
[2:45:53] <derap41> King is Queens is awesome
[2:45:55] <conchthechimera> QUEEEN to BEEEEEE
[2:46:02] <phistymcnutz56> ayyy moonlight greatsword swag
[2:46:07] <%fat_burtreynolds> Sister! Why do you smell like a Baka?
[2:46:07] <%Grimlockfly> Reggie basically need to choose sorcery or pyro, and he's pretty much super commited sorcery
[2:46:08] <SoaringTrumpet> 🔔
[2:46:11] <%CateHecate> I Cant Believe My Little Sister's Lower Half Is a Demon Spider?!?!
[2:46:14] <subjectg> man reggie getting dark bead would make this stupid
[2:46:14] <%fat_burtreynolds> Eryn Jaegar
[2:46:24] <%A_German_spy> Good question. Can't say I've ever tested it.
[2:46:28] <GHouseduivel> 🔔
[2:46:29] <%Valask> it probably doesn't matter
[2:46:29] <Wofoeh> One would assume that Woolie wont show reggie the sad shit from Sif's boss fight, or the alternate cutscene right
[2:46:30] <%theoldone001> Dark Bead and Pursuers will be dumb lol
[2:46:37] <%swesterly> @catehecate delet this
[2:46:38] <b_ikki> i imagine the network sound isn't tied to the game soudn
[2:46:48] <+Shishi1205> @Wofoeh I think he will in the dlc
[2:46:50] <spamspaz> I never found this bonfire in my playthroughs
[2:46:56] <spamspaz> The post-queallag one
[2:47:10] <shotgang86> oh yeah as soon as he gets it in the DLC that shit is STAYING
[2:47:11] <%tigerfang86> lmao
[2:47:11] <%Artoo__The_Me> I believe it’s tied to the cutscene starting or ending
[2:47:11] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[2:47:14] <%CateHecate> dont mind logan, he's just being Normal
[2:47:15] <%IronOhki> That super got me last stream.
[2:47:16] <%A_German_spy> BIG HAT ORRERY
[2:47:20] <Wofoeh> Also, I just noticed, thats the boar head, ornstein's chest, enchanter pants, and some gloves that I cant identify
[2:47:23] <subjectg> Batesian mimicry
[2:47:23] <%CateHecate> he's pondering the orb
[2:47:25] <Wofoeh> Right?
[2:47:28] <%tigerfang86> 🤔
[2:47:34] <emptyantics> Orb Pondering
[2:47:39] <%CateHecate> the flow of time is convoluted
[2:47:40] <%swesterly> Pondering the orb lmao
[2:47:40] <elshadow7> @Wofoeh Havel's gloves
[2:47:41] <klooswep> He cray-cray
[2:47:43] <iamtheTwitchghost> LUL
[2:47:43] <subjectg> @wofoeh channeler skirt, ornstein, havels
[2:47:45] <velgaduere> no need to sleep when you're undead
[2:47:45] <%mr_sups> He loosing it
[2:47:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> Do undead even need to sleep?
[2:47:46] <derap41> He doesn't need sleep he needs answrs
[2:47:47] <youngking_kush> @wofoeh Havel gloves
[2:47:52] <%fat_burtreynolds> Ondering his Porb
[2:47:54] <b_ikki> math god
[2:47:54] <%Valask> Grad student Logan
[2:47:55] <GHouseduivel> He just needs to close eyes
[2:47:57] <%SaintBeau> LOL
[2:48:00] <%tigerfang86> 113k wew
[2:48:00] <lord_of_the_dragons> that's me right now, my sleep schedule is non existant
[2:48:02] <+vaderxyz1970> He sleeps in his minds eye
[2:48:06] <Wofoeh> Aight, so reggie is going with "Fashion disaster" then
[2:48:14] <elshadow7> Quick mafs
[2:48:15] <KaiserMario> That's a lot of juju
[2:48:15] <derap41> 10ish runs in painted
[2:48:17] <%Valask> @Wofoeh you take that back
[2:48:19] <iamtheTwitchghost> UHM
[2:48:21] <%Ensign_Epic> So, I was wrong about the Catch Pole info being on wikidot. I had to go all the way & find a document that has literally all the stuff in Dark Souls but in text format
[2:48:22] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You're also 7k away from 4 more Soul Spears, if you prefer those.
[2:48:25] <%Xaeveax> @Wofoeh He looks so good
[2:48:35] <LunarRemix> Old piece of wood lol
[2:48:38] <%Grimlockfly> i like the izalith catalyst
[2:48:41] <%CateHecate> and so, reggarth cast his catalyst from the highest peak in lordran
[2:48:41] <%Ensign_Epic> But yeah, according to that spreadsheet, Catch Pole DOES have the Pity Drop system
[2:48:50] <youngking_kush> Best on the game
[2:48:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Soul Spear Spam?
[2:48:53] <derap41> 7K is one painted world run
[2:49:01] <%Valask> grinding stream zekeFGM
[2:49:05] <RyuuAoi> Those spears are wortgh it
[2:49:07] <%Ensign_Epic> which is called "Cumulate Reset" in the game itself
[2:49:07] <%Lion_kun> He can get most of them now
[2:49:14] <Johannen> We didnt want Reggie to farm)
[2:49:15] <klooswep> Only 4 away from 7,00 more soul spears!? Awesome Kappa
[2:49:16] <velgaduere> bosses drop tens of thousands of souls, he could just warp here after a boss and buy
[2:49:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> has he used bkss souls?
[2:49:25] <Wofoeh> I forgot how fucken S H I N Y great hero soul is
[2:49:26] <+vaderxyz1970> at this point we can skip the grinding with a loan.....
[2:49:28] <%Lion_kun> And he can use boss souls
[2:49:29] <Reveresao> boss souls?
[2:49:31] <pi_in_the_sci> boss souls?
[2:49:31] <+mechslayer71> did he do the thing chat? I just got here
[2:49:49] <%fat_burtreynolds> Forrest this time
[2:49:52] <shotgang86> he did things
[2:49:54] <subjectg> @woolieversus attune chaos storm if you’re gonna farm phalanx
[2:50:00] <Wofoeh> Hesitant with grinding, stopped time in the Paper mario playthrough for the wario costume
[2:50:04] <%AceNugget> My chaos orbs are turning blue
[2:50:04] <%swesterly> He could use some boss souls he isn’t making weapons
[2:50:04] <HloyDerWurstverkaufer> With Chaos Storm the phalanx dudes die really fast
[2:50:05] <elshadow7> You do have firestorm now
[2:50:07] <%Ensign_Epic> Would it be gauche to offer to drop some soul items for Reggie?
[2:50:10] <+mechslayer71> @shotgang86 the bad thing?
[2:50:13] <+Shishi1205> eat Priscilla
[2:50:13] <+Tizona824> Prob won't use Ornstein either
[2:50:18] <+Shishi1205> it's dex
[2:50:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> frampt is no longer an option right?
[2:50:23] <RyuuAoi> He did the onio n thing and failed miserably
[2:50:28] <shotgang86> I mean... does he have ANY use for Ornstein soul?
[2:50:30] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If you're going to farm, I'd suggest that you're better off getting your extra 4 casts of Soul Spear first, so you have 8 to use for farming.
[2:50:32] <ShogunRaven> butterfly spear is lit
[2:50:33] <subjectg> @cobalt_phoenix_ frampt gone, no duping
[2:50:33] <youngking_kush> Prob wont use Ornstein
[2:50:35] <Johannen> Butterfly is shit anyway
[2:50:35] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah he won't use Ornstrein soul
[2:50:44] <+mechslayer71> @ryuuaoi OOOOFFF
[2:50:46] <radiorosewater> @Ensign_Epic I don't think they're down with that, they've mentioned it before
[2:50:47] <GHouseduivel> @cobalt_phoenix_ We chose Kaath
[2:50:48] <Fireball_Spam> Butterfly is another magic weapon though, that might be nice.
[2:50:51] <%fat_burtreynolds> Go feed them to frampt
[2:50:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:50:56] <Johannen> What German Spy said
[2:50:57] <%Prevot> they can't use frampt anymore can they
[2:50:59] <KaiserMario> He cant
[2:51:05] <%theoldone001> Letting Reggie decide is a lot easier than keep putting up with chat bringing it up, Souls are way cheaper going forward anyways.
[2:51:06] <+Shishi1205> @a_german_spy they have chaos Storm now
[2:51:06] <%phistymcnutz56> phistymcnutz56 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:51:07] <elshadow7> Frampty is a little grumpty right now
[2:51:10] <derap41> 8 not 80
[2:51:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> German Spy using big brain tactics
[2:51:18] <Johannen> @Shishi1205 Spear is safer
[2:51:20] <derap41> math is hard
[2:51:26] <+mechslayer71> wait, what ending is Reggie going for?
[2:51:28] <%Lion_kun> If farming is needed it will be minor
[2:51:28] <youngking_kush> He needs like 60k
[2:51:28] <%IronOhki> @elshadow7 Wait, did you talk to my brother? Eff you.
[2:51:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> M A T H
[2:51:32] <subjectg> @a_german_spy we have chaos storm though, we’re good
[2:51:43] <%IronOhki> "Oh ho ho, I see your number went up."
[2:51:47] <+Shishi1205> @johannen if Reggie learns to aim yes
[2:51:54] <shotgang86> mah boy EATING
[2:51:57] <%IronOhki> Aiming is overrated.
[2:51:59] <%A_German_spy> @Shishi1205 @subjectg Yeah, I was here when they got it. As useful as it is, though, Soul Spear is still easier to use because it pierces and has a predictable trajectory.
[2:52:01] <%theoldone001> GIRTH
[2:52:07] <%Valask> you should get invaded more often by big dick invadres if you walk around with souls
[2:52:11] <sporeian94> Go and feed the coins to frampf they are worth a bunch
[2:52:14] <%Valask> actually do you?
[2:52:16] <Johannen> @Shishi1205 With 8 casts who need aiming, accuracy thru volume of fire)
[2:52:20] <gangsta_oki> We playin Souls
[2:52:22] <%Valask> I'm surprised you don't
[2:52:33] <youngking_kush> @sporeian94 Frampt is gone
[2:52:33] <+Shishi1205> @a_german_spy for efficiency yeah. Gotta teach Reggie spell aiming tho
[2:52:34] <subjectg> @a_german_spy i guess, but it was hilarious in og when the framerate would die when you did it there LUL
[2:52:36] <%gulthrax> woolie looks like a grizzled souls veteran
[2:52:40] <+masarusasaki> rip queelag
[2:52:44] <JairusHopesItWorks> 40k for extra soul spear
[2:52:46] <shotgang86> Should have used in front of Queelana
[2:52:55] <conchthechimera> Reggie "I'll TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK"
[2:52:58] <agustorm123> That’s too much
[2:53:02] <%A_German_spy> @Shishi1205 I mean... I dunno if you were here for Centipede Demon, but Reggie apparently doesn't need any help free-aiming his Soul Spears karacoLOL
[2:53:08] <BlueEagle2395> I'll buy da money

[2:53:41] <%Dopamien> WutFace
[2:53:42] <%A_German_spy> @subjectg On that point, I certainly agree. My personal favorite was the Dragon Head glitch with Prism Stones. Crashing the game by puking rainbows is a joy we'll never get back.
[2:53:43] <%Xaeveax> heyzeusWiz Have you heard of Master Logan? heyzeusWiz
[2:53:45] <+masarusasaki> hm that was fast

[2:53:46] <Raldavar> You get more souls for overkill kills. Soul spear with dragon ring on phalanx is a lot easier and less roundabout

[2:55:00] <KaiserMario> Elevator at the beginning
[2:55:01] <velgaduere> the game expects you to remember important locations, of course
[2:55:03] <%SaintBeau> there's a shortcut up the stairs
[2:55:03] <Reveresao> out door and up stairs
[2:55:04] <youngking_kush> The entrance to DA

[3:04:23] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Before you leave this room, it's worth checking out the balcony up above you. Might be some good shit up there.
[3:04:28] <derap41> You could grind Int off stream?
[3:04:33] <shotgang86> man in DS3 we get magic and a weapon that asks for 66 in a stat
[3:04:44] <shotgang86> at a point that you think "oh I'm not leveling up anymore"
[3:04:45] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus this room demands exploration

[3:05:16] <shotgang86> @MogarEpoch there is a hammer in the DLC that asks I think its 66 or even more
[3:05:18] <Johannen> @derap41 I dont think they will need to grind with DLC still ahead and if anything they would only grind for items if need be
[3:05:24] <Fireball_Spam> Logan isn't hollow, he went conventionally insane.
[3:05:28] <+Shishi1205> nice eye reggie
[3:05:30] <%AbnormalVoid> weird how the large magic ember is here, and not the crystal one
[3:05:36] <%Valask> He also took his clothes off because apparently Seath is also naked
[3:05:36] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus To get your souls back, if you died here
[3:05:40] <LunarRemix> Seath would be here if you came before you killed him on the Crystal caves

[3:06:19] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus That requires to kill Seeth without dying
[3:06:26] <%Ensign_Epic> So, fun fact, if you don't beat Seath & come back up here? The first boss fight starts again.
[3:06:30] <+Shishi1205> 20k
[3:06:30] <oak120> Seath will still be here.

[3:06:41] <LunarRemix> @WoolieVersus Seath would be here if you did that. You can only access this room after you kill Seath in the crystal caves

[3:09:33] <%fat_burtreynolds> Burner Catalyst
[3:09:35] <Hozak> He wanted to be scaleless!
[3:09:41] <%AbnormalVoid> compare to sorcerer's, at your Int level, it might be less MagAdjust
[3:09:44] <subjectg> you need more int for it to work better
[3:09:52] <%FallenAngelZelos> For nerds only
[3:09:52] <%Valask> 200IQ only
[3:09:57] <klooswep> Logan ran naked past everyone because he wanted to be a speedrunnner
[3:09:58] <styptysat> Galaxy Brain time
[3:10:01] <youngking_kush> Now just keep pumping that INT baybee
[3:10:02] <%SarcFa> think sorc's is better atm

[3:11:00] <+Shishi1205> go get the extra spears
[3:11:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> FIRST improvement on the catalyst in the whole game
[3:11:08] <elshadow7> @WoolieVersus might wanna replace rusted iron ring

[3:11:21] <+Rafraud> did we finish izalith?
[3:11:24] <%CateHecate> yeah man i iced him

[3:21:26] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen Sure thing. If memory serves, you have to go back to the church roof and talk to him after beating the Four Kings, and he has some new dialogue where he basically says, "Oh, guess I'm unemployed now"
[3:21:26] <%holydeviant1> What's wild is he's a smith that's available like... right away. He does normal enhancement too!
[3:21:32] <youngking_kush> I somehow found Vamos but not Rickert lol

[3:22:43] <youngking_kush> If you're min-maxing a +15 Weapon w/CMW is the highest damage on an INT build I believe. but you lose mad cool points without MLGS lol

[3:24:59] <Treasure_Vault> Woolie showed Pat a bonfire in his run!
[3:25:06] <%SarcFa> @A_German_spy with the lag often present using the pendant is iffy, also a good way to take a crystal soul spear to the face after the first use

[3:33:21] <U_l_f_b_e_r_h_t> oof
[3:33:24] <%holydeviant1> The magic IS strong. But it has its place.
[3:33:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> To be fair, magic in PVE is like this. You leave yourself very vulnerable.
[3:33:25] <+Double_Tap_That> Magic missile!

[3:33:57] <%Vigonept> BUT I'M A MAGE NOT A FILTHY SWORDSMAN
[3:33:58] <nintega010> You're a mage who knows how to use a sword
[3:33:59] <%Prevot> reggie doesn't do well when enemies resist his magic dmg even slightly
[3:34:02] <legacy0117> Titanite Demons are really resistant to magic, unfortunately.
[3:34:07] <%Dopamien> I believe 🙏
[3:34:11] <Arqartur0> what about playing with Hootie?
[3:34:13] <%andrewofbob> Bust out the pocket swordfighter
[3:34:19] <%CateHecate> Oops! All Poison Glands
[3:34:21] <QueequegTheater> This fight is apparently a 9-1 matchup
[3:34:23] <+EySoyCoco> if you kill them with the pole is a FE3H level of "im killing you with your ma's spinal cord"
[3:34:23] <shotgang86> I mean, open with the soulmass and the 4 spears
[3:34:24] <nintega010> @WoolieVersus excited for the df duel beta
[3:34:31] <%Vigonept> nah its not poisonous no more
[3:34:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie you're asking him to stop using magic and swing his magic sword on the magic resistant enemy
[3:34:39] <legacy0117> And Moonlight great sword is pure magic damage.

[3:44:40] <Johannen> I always got confused on that elevator)
[3:44:40] <subjectg> @mitchellsocks this bonfire’s okay if you run past everything since you don’t have to equip the ring
[3:44:41] <+Rafraud> this is the only apology you'll get Reggie
[3:44:42] <NumbF4ke> I bet 10 deaths at minimum
[3:44:42] <%Prevot> honestly the other bonfire is better IMO
[3:44:51] <Wofoeh> To the universaly known, WORST BOSS in the series
[3:44:53] <+Tizona824> I only know one thing. I have to kill Chaos
[3:44:54] <%Rojahh> @WoolieVersus should we inform reggie That Miyazaki is Sorry?
[3:44:57] <oneimportantthing> And the damn marathon you have to run

[3:45:02] <KaiserMario> Woolie has zero faith in Reggie's luck LUL
[3:45:02] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus definitely go to the bonfire Reggie found in the lava area in Izalith to make the runback less sucky
[3:45:02] <Mitchellsocks> @subjectg ring might as well stay on cause you dont need bellowing for bed
[3:45:02] <+Rafraud> if he beats it yeah
[3:45:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Rojahh after
[3:45:03] <wragglee> 9
[3:45:03] <anthropomorphictempest> ancient dragon is worse

[3:45:08] <Johannen> @Rojahh I think after
[3:45:08] <LunarRemix> He'll probably comment it after a couple more deaths
[3:45:09] <yukichocomilk> reggie doesn't even know the despair that awaits him

[3:45:41] <+Rafraud> I think he alluded to apologizing for the archers but kinda stood by it
[3:45:44] <%A_German_spy> @cobalt_phoenix_ They acknowledged the archers, but didn't specifically apologize.

[3:51:08] <subjectg> you just don’t get the set if you don’t do all 3
[3:51:14] <fmbboaventura> can you summon npcs for this fight? I don't remember that

[3:52:02] <%A_German_spy> @Deekman You can, but it's pointless unless you have two summons and all three of you coordinate which part of the boss you're going for from the start

[3:53:08] <$eco419> Reggy at risk
[3:53:09] <oak120> @paladinstarbuster it comes back?
[3:53:09] <%Dopamien> time to think about life choices on the run elaPain
[3:53:11] <JdotSweapA> for the trek
[3:53:12] <%vVAstrAVv> whys he making reggie burn humanity?
[3:53:12] <%theoldone001> Damn, one run broke his soul already haha
[3:53:12] <%RemedyofRevenge> there is a way quicker run that can be done at a closer bonfire Reggie has been to @WoolieVersus
[3:53:14] <QueequegTheater> @thefranchise00 Kirk
[3:53:15] <%MrATheGreat> @JdotSweapA artorias
[3:53:15] <ShogunRaven> @JdotSweapA Artorias is at least fun
[3:53:16] <%JetpackMcQuack> back to mordor
[3:53:17] <%mr_sups> Zone Bad, Run Bad, Boss Bad, Bad Part of the Game
[3:53:18] <%Prevot> @jdotsweapa nah artorias is easy
[3:53:18] <Riyokuno> and another one ... and another one
[3:53:18] <shotgang86> isnt it better to go for the other one?
[3:53:19] <%SarcFa> @paladinstarbuster He'd die more trying to kill it, based off previous performance
[3:53:21] <DJ6S> that run is a third of a Snake Eater ladder
[3:53:22] <OldManDeckardCain> in a future compilation someone needs to put stop hammer time thing in
[3:53:25] <Papa_Shu> @JdotSweapA this for sure. Artorias is a fair fight. Bed of Chaos is a horribly designed one
[3:53:26] <nxflre> @thefranchise00 Woolie wants Reg to get invaded by Kirk
[3:53:26] <Equirah> @thefranchise00 it's not for the fight
[3:53:27] <%A_German_spy> @Deekman There are a few "cheese" strats for Bed of Chaos, but I say "cheese" in quotations because as far as I'm concerned, anything is fair game for dealing with this godawful piece of game design.
[3:53:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You're lucky that EVERYTHING in the entire rest of the series is better than this
[3:53:30] <+kevlarkoala> Serious question: is there a worse boss in the entire Fromsoft catalog?
[3:53:31] <shotgang86> because this titanite demon is a problem
[3:53:35] <JdotSweapA> Nah i mean which of the 2 takes LONGEST to run to from BF
[3:53:35] <oneimportantthing> Artorisd is fair and short, this is bullshit
[3:53:38] <Johannen> @JdotSweapA Artorias is depened on your ability, Kalammet is the second longest i would bet
[3:53:39] <thefranchise00> ah ty ty
[3:53:43] <rasamune> @kevlarkoala no
[3:53:45] <brunoberserk> you cant warp to the other bonfire, but is much closer
[3:53:47] <agustorm123> You gonna learn today
[3:53:47] <+Jiggisnipe> @paladinstarbuster it killed him 4 times when he fought it lol. he's 1-1 running pass it so far...
[3:53:48] <+tnomads> @kevlarkoala Ancient Dragon
[3:53:52] <emptyantics> @kevlarkoala Not worse but the Giant Dragon in DS 2 sucks ass
[3:53:57] <Wofoeh> @fruit_pie_the_magician Yup, the end game in this game is a dud
[3:53:58] <KaiserMario> This is Woolie's favorite Souls boss
[3:53:59] <radiorosewater> @kevlarkoala Dragon God?
[3:53:59] <anthropomorphictempest> @kevlarkoala yep
[3:54:00] <+0neReeler> good ole boss trekking

[3:54:14] <AvroEltz> Welcome in Izalith
[3:54:16] <QueequegTheater> @kevlarkoala Ancient Dragon pre-nerf was pretty bad but he's way more manageable now
[3:54:18] <%BisoromiBear> God I forgot about the Ancient Dragon
[3:54:21] <pi_in_the_sci> Dragon God is actually worse than this
[3:54:25] <nxflre> @kevlarkoala Dragon God is tolerable tho
[3:54:26] <%JetpackMcQuack> he's so cool
[3:54:27] <%vVAstrAVv> @kevlarkoala dragon god gets credit for the disapointment lol
[3:54:29] <rasamune> The worst boss in the King's Field series is probably better than Bed of Chaos
[3:54:29] <anthropomorphictempest> @shotgang86 horsefuck valley? ptsd intensifies
[3:54:31] <iamtheTwitchghost> dragon god is fine
[3:54:34] <subjectg> i’d say Ludd and Zallen have the worst boss run of the whole series i think
[3:54:34] <BearSawed> Unfortunatly ds1 falls apart at the seems for the lord souls section

[3:54:44] <+cdrom321> @emptyantics Ancient Dragon. Are you saying that it's bad originally or now in which it's easier?
[3:54:44] <%Lightwolfe> Deafening

[3:54:58] <QueequegTheater> Lud and Zallen are hard but they're still not nearly as unfair.  They still obey the rules of the game
[3:55:03] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Holding shield up while running prevents you from jumping
[3:55:04] <%Prevot> DS2 is like a whole game made of the (not so good) later parts of DS1
[3:55:18] <anthropomorphictempest> @Prevot DS2 has high highs and low lows
[3:55:24] <%JetpackMcQuack> hold
[3:55:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> there we go
[3:55:25] <+Jiggisnipe> yep
[3:55:26] <%strakillias> He can eat the lightning, got plenty of estus
[3:55:26] <shotgang86> time to die in ONE swipe baby
[3:55:28] <subjectg> we’re talking about boss runs, not the boss themselves, they can still be really hard on ng+ though @queequegtheater
[3:55:28] <+Jiggisnipe> almost when too fast
[3:55:28] <iamtheTwitchghost> HOOOLLD
[3:55:28] <%Valask> ayyyyyy

[3:55:31] <%BisoromiBear> Free hugs
[3:55:32] <JdotSweapA> kirk want smoke!
[3:55:33] <%Irridium> Most of DS2's high highs are from the DLC's
[3:55:34] <+hybridfusio> Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the run from the lava bonfire much shorter?
[3:55:35] <mothdude> Ancient Dragon was a nightmare but it's also optional so I can forgive it somewhat for being Fuck You.
[3:55:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ez
[3:55:44] <+parazoa42> Kirk here for his daily ass whooping
[3:55:45] <conchthechimera> GG
[3:55:45] <%vVAstrAVv> oh thats why humanity

[3:55:47] <DJ6S> bruh
[3:55:47] <%SaintBeau> Clap
[3:55:48] <iamtheTwitchghost> rip
[3:55:49] <AvroEltz> Congrats reggie, get this W
[3:55:50] <thefranchise00> holy shit the stagger on that sword
[3:55:53] <%strakillias> Stairs OP
[3:55:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nah, DS2 is a game with a tiny bit of jank sprinkled roughly evenly throughout. All the Jank in DS1 is contained almost entirely in like 3 areas and it makes them total trash
[3:55:59] <Equirah> Stop, colaborate and listen
[3:56:01] <ShogunRaven> OH MY GOD
[3:56:01] <+Jiggisnipe> got the shield and sword
[3:56:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Both lmao
[3:56:03] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Well, there's 60% of your next Soul Spear right there karacoLOL
[3:56:03] <+Jiggisnipe> nice nice
[3:56:06] <+Jiggisnipe> NICE NICE
[3:56:06] <shotgang86> HOW
[3:56:06] <radiorosewater> In 3
[3:56:06] <%holydeviant1> Edge set
[3:56:07] <Wofoeh> So, reggie didnt decide to FAP this run huh
[3:56:07] <ShogunRaven> LUCKY
[3:56:07] <QueequegTheater> OH FUCK OFF
[3:56:08] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You find his corpse in the Fair Lady room so it is likely he invades people to gather Humanity for her
[3:56:08] <%LastHazzerd> wait what?!
[3:56:08] <agustorm123> Lucky dude
[3:56:10] <+Rafraud> man FUCK
[3:56:11] <klooswep> If he's Kirk then why doesn't he use the Kirkhammer? bloobySmart
[3:56:13] <+Jiggisnipe> LUCKY REGGIE
[3:56:13] <LunarRemix> Of course he'd get both of the drops in a single encounter.
[3:56:14] <+cdrom321> @mothdude There's a strategy that makes Ancient Dragon much easier.
[3:56:16] <Equirah> @ShogunRaven you get an item per invasion, it's hard coded
[3:56:16] <%notsoy> there's the good luck, now he's going to roll into a hole again
[3:56:16] <%LastHazzerd> goddamn streamer luck
[3:56:18] <%RyTYoung> This is some buuuuuuullshiiiiiit
[3:56:19] <DJ6S> bruh x2
[3:56:21] <%hax_metatron> ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN
[3:56:21] <GiantDad2003> you lucky little so and so
[3:56:22] <shotgang86> he got BOTH
[3:56:23] <+Baldzinga> Reggie’s luck is just utterly ridiculous
[3:56:23] <urkleturtle> kirk is such a goddamn chump. but his armor gave us the greatest of all ds3 videos
[3:56:24] <subjectg> DS2’s highs are in the DLCs and the PvP, which I’d argue give it greater replayability (back when people were playing it)
[3:56:25] <%holydeviant1> ...He always drops those guys
[3:56:30] <Papa_Shu> someone get this man a bottomless box
[3:56:31] <%SaintBeau> Lucky Reg strikes again
[3:56:32] <BearSawed> Ds2 SOTFS is like lets make the game harder! Menwhile, guy in background, "but will it make it better?" The rest of the board room yells, "Who cares?"
[3:56:33] <+Shishi1205> @Johannen he is in rosarias covenant too
[3:56:34] <%hax_metatron> ITS NOT LUCK THEY ARE GUAEANTEED DROPS LUL
[3:56:36] <peachy996> These should really be alphabetical
[3:56:37] <anthropomorphictempest> @fruit_pie_the_magician yeah but once you get the hang of it you can use the jank to your advantage
[3:56:42] <+Rafraud> it's okay he waisted his bed rng for it
[3:56:47] <QueequegTheater> @BearSawed But it is better
[3:56:51] <+Rafraud> *wasted
[3:56:57] <shotgang86> hey reggie, dual wield tha black knight sword with barbed sword and switch to the shield
[3:56:58] <%holydeviant1> why did everyone freak out those are gaurenteed
[3:56:59] <shotgang86> just to flex
[3:57:03] <Jimbobbity> Why does Woolie look like hes malding at that lmao
[3:57:04] <@Menitta> I lost internet what'd I miss
[3:57:06] <+Baldzinga> Lucky guaranteed drops. evoMindBlown
[3:57:08] <QueequegTheater> @holydeviant1 Not on attempt 1
[3:57:11] <velgaduere> @Menitta Kirk
[3:57:15] <%RyTYoung> @baldzinga LUL
[3:57:15] <+Shishi1205> @Menitta kirk invaded
[3:57:18] <@Menitta> Ah sick
[3:57:22] <emptyantics> @menitta Lost to the BoC 2 times
[3:57:24] <subjectg> Barbed straight sword is alright for bleed buildup
[3:57:26] <Equirah> @BearSawed but it's easier
[3:57:30] <+Shishi1205> Is he?
[3:57:31] <Papa_Shu> someone get this man a bottomless box
[3:57:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I can deal with a little bit of jank constantly. These areas are like 80 percent unfinished jank, at least the bad areas of 2 aren't straight unfinished garbage
[3:57:35] <$eco419> LuvSign
[3:57:38] <%SaintBeau> i thought he was a Servant of Chaos
[3:57:38] <%Valask> is he...?
[3:57:40] <%JetpackMcQuack> the pointiest darkwraith
[3:57:41] <%SarcFa> @BearSawed SoTFS is better in some areas, worse in others
[3:57:45] <mothdude> Scholar is weird because some areas are made easier and some are made harder.
[3:57:46] <youngking_kush> GPe
[3:57:46] <%Rasheedt> @papa_shu he has one thesph1BabyFUwatch
[3:57:47] <%Prevot> I thought he was a chaos boy
[3:57:55] <%SaintBeau> He's a Chaos Servant, no???
[3:57:57] <%A_German_spy> @Prevot He is. It's complicated.
[3:57:59] <+Nero_Cross> He started out a Darkwraith and defected to Chaos after meeting spidertits
[3:58:00] <%AbnormalVoid> @WoolieVersus you can't get the armor unless you do them all
[3:58:01] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus he's a chaos servent
[3:58:02] <%holydeviant1> @SaintBeau He's a simp for the Lady, but not a chaos boy
[3:58:06] <Papa_Shu> someone get this man to USE his bottomless box LUL
[3:58:08] <+Shishi1205> you miss his armor tho
[3:58:11] <%MrATheGreat> miss out on his armor tho
[3:58:14] <anthropomorphictempest> @BearSawed I think DS2 has better level design than DS1 tbh
[3:58:20] <%hax_metatron> You need him 3 times for the armor.
[3:58:23] <%holydeviant1> He uses the red rb to get humanity for the Lady
[3:58:24] <+warlockwithapixie> Its fine
[3:58:28] <%Prevot> he invades after the first capra in demon ruins
[3:58:29] <shotgang86> the armor is in anor londo if I'm not wrong
[3:58:32] <%AbnormalVoid> he does, yeah
[3:58:33] <%hax_metatron> Yeah it’s fine though
[3:58:36] <subjectg> @fruit_pie_the_magician at the very least, ds2 is consistent in its jank so you’re never taken out of it too bad. DS1 you can lose all motivation after O&S
[3:58:40] <QueequegTheater> He does
[3:58:40] <Papa_Shu> @shotgang86 you're thinking of Lautrec
[3:58:43] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[3:58:45] <QueequegTheater> He quit the Darkwraiths
[3:58:47] <%swesterly> Nah the armor is at the daughter of chaos
[3:58:48] <GiantDad2003> ex darkwraith
[3:58:49] <%SaintBeau> WAS a Darkwraith, BECAME a Chaos boi
[3:58:49] <shotgang86> @shotgang86 oh right yeah
[3:58:50] <%superc37> chat i imagine woolie will mention the chaos thing when they kill all the npcs at the end- okay nvm i guess
[3:58:52] <BearSawed> @QueequegTheater Not saying it isnt the better version, just that it has more bs in it
[3:58:53] <AvroEltz> He a double agent
[3:58:55] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yup. Devs didn't bother checking their work on that one.
[3:58:57] <+RavenGlock> waifu > darkwraiths
[3:58:58] <Equirah> @shotgang86 right by quelag, on the dead-end
[3:59:00] <%SarcFa> I think he was a Darkwraith that turn coated to Chaos Servant
[3:59:02] <%AbnormalVoid> it's implied he was a darkwraith, then was infatuated by the lady
[3:59:02] <QueequegTheater> @BearSawed fair LUL
[3:59:03] <%theoldone001> He started out as a Darkwraith but meets the Fair Lady and becomes a Chaos Bro
[3:59:04] <%AceNugget> bye bye souls
[3:59:04] <glass_marcus> DS2's consistent jank makes not want to play any of it
[3:59:06] <%SaintBeau> once he met the Fair Lady, he became a Chaos Servant
[3:59:07] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:59:07] <%IronOhki> I put off playing DS2 for a very long time because of the bashing. I'm finally playing it. It IS a bit off, but I'm really enjoying it.
[3:59:08] <Treasure_Vault> Ex-Darkwraith, Simping for Spidertuber
[3:59:10] <%holydeviant1> Sad reggie
[3:59:12] <subjectg> It’s implied he’s a Darkwraith outwardly and then secretly is a Chaos simp
[3:59:12] <+Blue256> LUL
[3:59:13] <velgaduere> LUL
[3:59:14] <+tnomads> good luck
[3:59:14] <+cdrom321> Kazoo music and clown shoes!
[3:59:14] <pyjama_day> @glass_marcus ditto
[3:59:15] <+guyremex> just intime
[3:59:16] <klooswep> You need all three encounters to get the armor, correct?
[3:59:16] <rasamune> And you will!
[3:59:17] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus He started off a sigma but became a simp
[3:59:17] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus He collects humanity for the Fair Lady
[3:59:19] <velgaduere> bones exist
[3:59:25] <+guyremex> sure can
[3:59:29] <%hax_metatron> It is extremely easy for him to get humanity as a Darkwraith. Which is why he cheats that covenant to give humanity to his true covenant, the fair lady.
[3:59:34] <%SaintBeau> welcome to hell
[3:59:35] <$oFlooofy> NotLikeThis
[3:59:35] <shotgang86> hehehe
[3:59:39] <oak120> Did Reggie ever pick up the Witch Set after 4 Kings?
[3:59:39] <Dr_Mooose> good luck Reggie
[3:59:40] <Raldavar> You ca be both though
[3:59:44] <%SaintBeau> Reggie, no
[3:59:44] <Hozak> Didn't the Zullie video say that even the hit box on this boss is broken? Like its not actually bound properly to its arms?
[3:59:45] <iamtheTwitchghost> OUCH
[3:59:45] <+Rafraud> YESSIIIIIRRR
[3:59:46] <+Jiggisnipe> yep
[3:59:46] <peachy996> hahahaha
[3:59:46] <shotgang86> best boss
[3:59:46] <%AbnormalVoid> the damage in this is fucked up
[3:59:47] <Deko_> LUL
[3:59:47] <exjusthamad> a shitty version of the dragon god boss fight
[3:59:48] <%IronOhki> yuuuuuuuuup
[3:59:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DS2 is like a solid 7 throughout, with some spikes up to like 8 or 9. DS1 is a solid 9 with some areas that are like 5s
[3:59:50] <Riyokuno> that was the wrong move
[3:59:51] <solus_is_watching> B I G  D A M A G E

[3:59:55] <yukichocomilk> what a great boss LUL
[3:59:55] <DarknessHS> so much bullshit LUL
[3:59:56] <+Blue256> poor guy
[3:59:56] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus lore is since he's a darkwraith he can drain humanity to feed it to spiderlady
[3:59:57] <%Irridium> we in there
[3:59:59] <shotgang86> we are staying for a while lads
[4:00:00] <iamtheTwitchghost> GREAT BOSS

[4:00:03] <WillSin4Cash> chaos needs to chill
[4:00:03] <+warlockwithapixie> This is gonna be a bad one
[4:00:04] <%AbnormalVoid> not even betting on it, because it's so fucked LUL
[4:00:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WELCOME TO THE PARTY TREE
[4:00:06] <%theoldone001> Dragon God is literally a better version of this lol
[4:00:06] <JdotSweapA> CaitlynS
[4:00:07] <%MrATheGreat> my b TAKE 4
[4:00:09] <stevenellis386> woof indeed
[4:00:09] <+hybridfusio> Might want to try the lava bonfire. You have to swap rings but I think the run is much faster
[4:00:12] <JdotSweapA> hongan1What hongan1What hongan1What
[4:00:12] <shotgang86> reggie its not your fault this one sucks
[4:00:15] <%JetpackMcQuack> woof
[4:00:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> big big woofs
[4:00:21] <anthropomorphictempest> @IronOhki I just finished a replay of it and had a blast after powering through the beginning. Once you get that ADP up to 25 the game becomes 100x better
[4:00:22] <KyberNasse> FUN INNIT
[4:00:27] <Johannen> Chat is screaming at Woolie to talk about Kirk and the Fair Lady LUL
[4:00:28] <Papa_Shu> @hybridfusio yeah I'm confused why they're doing this way
[4:00:30] <%Prevot> I found that blocking BoC attacks is better than trying to dodge
[4:00:31] <emptyantics> !uptims
[4:00:31] <shotgang86> no one here is going to judge if you spend 3 hours here
[4:00:33] <%swesterly> Try the other bonfire mray
[4:00:34] <trench2nowhere> this attempt 4 or 3?
[4:00:36] <emptyantics> !uptime
[4:00:36] <@Moobot> @emptyantics WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 11 minutes
[4:00:39] <$eco419> :o
[4:00:39] <+Rafraud> no no, it IS Reggie's fault Kappa
[4:00:44] <thelivingglitch307> normal
[4:00:45] <LunarRemix> There is no Reggie'ing through BoC
[4:00:45] <%RyTYoung> Reggarth will figure it out Kappa
[4:00:51] <%LastHazzerd> R U Reggie?
[4:00:51] <%RemedyofRevenge> The bonfire in the middle of Izalith, after the bonfire after the cenepede fight is a much faster run back, by like half of this
[4:00:54] <$eco419> Kappa
[4:01:00] <%CateHecate> keep in mind that aside from the rooftop archers, this is the only thing that miyazaki ever APOLOGIZED for
[4:01:00] <stevenellis386> dont worry chat, Reggie got this
[4:01:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> just win Kappa
[4:01:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I've been through this game like 10 times and this piece of shit till boned me for over an hour last time
[4:01:10] <emptyantics> Just dont die Kappa
[4:01:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:01:13] <%AceNugget> how's titanite demon feeling this run?
[4:01:15] <%holydeviant1> Reggie, imagine if you didn't have that path!
[4:01:15] <+Rafraud> simply don't lose
[4:01:16] <shotgang86> but man pick another bonfire, the other one is better and shorter
[4:01:16] <Equirah> @LunarRemix a debrie falls from the ceiling and hits the other spike LUL
[4:01:16] <peachy996> the longer run is more beneficial
[4:01:18] <+Jiggisnipe> that
[4:01:18] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @andiwaffles
[4:01:20] <a_mad_dragon_> has ANYONE with no prior knowledge one-shotted bed of chaos? LUL
[4:01:21] <oak120> it slaps
[4:01:21] <+Rafraud> yeah
[4:01:22] <%SaintBeau> lol
[4:01:24] <Scorchfield> well, unless you start running from the other bonfire
[4:01:24] <%LastHazzerd> this IS the boss
[4:01:25] <+TopTieramisu> (shit the) bed of chaos
[4:01:25] <subjectg> @anthropomorphictempest even just 100 agility rather than 110 is good enough for even pvp, Accepted SL for pvp even got bumped higher, i don’t really know what the issue was
[4:01:25] <peachy996> gives him more time to reflect
[4:01:26] <anthropomorphictempest> @fruit_pie_the_magician I'm lowkey surprised they didn't fix it in the remaster
[4:01:27] <+Jiggisnipe> you saw it
[4:01:28] <%Ensign_Epic> wrong side first is something I'm not sure I remember seeing
[4:01:29] <peachy996> HAHA
[4:01:31] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL LUL
[4:01:33] <%MrATheGreat> JESUS
[4:01:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> oof
[4:01:35] <shotgang86> ooooooooooff
[4:01:36] <stevenellis386> ay carumba
[4:01:37] <+AkronymCLT> Will Lucky Reggie
[4:01:39] <%Dopamien> monkaS
[4:01:39] <%HAttilaTheFun> I still think the lava path is better, in spite of the ring switching
[4:01:40] <$oFlooofy> LUL
[4:01:40] <DeathByPoke7> thank god for poise
[4:01:43] <%swesterly> Damn if only there was another path
[4:01:43] <+AkronymCLT> return
[4:01:45] <%SaintBeau> the lava path is quicker
[4:01:49] <shotgang86> poise saved you
[4:01:53] <pyjama_day> @a_mad_dragon_ I did. But then on subsequent playthroughs I died every time.
[4:01:57] <Mitchellsocks> Lava path pleaaaase
[4:02:03] <%SaintBeau> Izalith bonfire pls
[4:02:06] <peachy996> No
[4:02:11] <peachy996> Stay the course
[4:02:14] <jaygee303> Woolie big backseat
[4:02:16] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Reminder that holding up your shield will prevent you from jumping, it will always queue a roll.
[4:02:19] <%AceNugget> that lightining is nowhere near as strong as a swing
[4:02:21] <JdotSweapA> ouuuuuuuuuuu~
[4:02:25] <Deko_> LUL
[4:02:27] <Treasure_Vault> The other bonfire is nice and closer, but you gotta switch to the fire ring
[4:02:27] <+liquidzr0> ........
[4:02:27] <QueequegTheater> No you aren't
[4:02:28] <velgaduere> it's workin for him
[4:02:31] <anthropomorphictempest> @subjectg Right like for PvE most of the bosses become super easy. The only issue is when you get ganked out of nowhere
[4:02:34] <%SaintBeau> @Treasure_Vault still much quicker
[4:02:34] <JdotSweapA> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[4:02:38] <+Jiggisnipe> he needs to avoid the swing mainly or jump
[4:02:40] <andiwaffles> @Fireball_Spam seems that I'm wrong about Allant (unless the person who told me read a translated niche interview but that's unlikely) I found the interview about Bed of Chaos though it's interesting
[4:02:44] <$eco419> BibleThump
[4:02:47] <ShogunRaven> I agree with Woolie
[4:02:49] <radiorosewater> "Know what I mean?"
[4:02:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Isn't Bed of Chaos great? Kappa

[4:03:50] <ShogunRaven> @Valask only if you kill him 3 times
[4:03:51] <%swesterly> Lava bonfire
[4:03:52] <shotgang86> he spent the luck on the double drop
[4:03:53] <+Shishi1205> @Valask all encounters are needed
[4:03:53] <+Aldra_E> I think that is it LUL
[4:03:57] <%Prevot> reggie is probably clawing
[4:03:57] <%theoldone001> Y'all both need a Snicker
[4:03:59] <Johannen> Reggie's refusal to use shields might bite him in the ass on Bed of Chaos
[4:04:01] <+Rafraud> HOLD THAT ENERGY REGGIE
[4:04:01] <%SaintBeau> here we goooo

[4:04:15] <ShogunRaven> @Johannen Even with havels shield it's still bad
[4:04:16] <+alphonseisbest> woolie has become Pat LMAO
[4:04:17] <sosandstorm> good ol bed of chaos
[4:04:18] <%NahmenJayden> !REGGIT AT RISK!
[4:04:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Woolie The Overexplainer: "You don't have to overexplain it"
[4:04:19] <%SaintBeau> so much quicker
[4:04:20] <%LastHazzerd> They're such good friends
[4:04:21] <%Juriasu> LUL
[4:04:22] <Equirah> @Johannen she still pushes you in on block, you have to roll
[4:04:23] <oneimportantthing> Woolie has channeled Pat
[4:04:23] <thefranchise00> all could be avoided if it was a different bonfire
[4:04:26] <pyjama_day> @shotgang86 it seriously is...
[4:04:26] <+Rafraud> [FINAL]
[4:04:26] <AvroEltz> DAMN, Woolie telling someone else to not overexplain, BoC is crazy
[4:04:27] <%Lightwolfe> The Flame of Chaos was gaslight all along
[4:04:29] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Also jump is bad, it helps if he hold the shield up to roll
[4:04:31] <velgaduere> Izalith bonfire would keep this run from taking so long
[4:04:33] <daswampken> one guy
[4:04:33] <%robosqueeb> CALLED OUT
[4:04:34] <Awesome_Leaf> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

[4:04:40] <anthropomorphictempest> @DarknessHS "You see that Bed of Chaos over there in the distance? You can go there."
[4:04:40] <ShogunRaven> @velgaduere it's about the same tbh

[4:11:55] <%BisoromiBear> still learning the matchup
[4:11:59] <%Dopamien> the gimmick is it sucks calebKek
[4:12:01] <brunoberserk> the gimmick is : BULLSHIT
[4:12:03] <emptyantics> Bullshit boss LUL
[4:12:07] <+Shishi1205> @RyuuAoi this is the worst one
[4:12:08] <anthropomorphictempest> How is this worse than every gimmick boss in DS2?
[4:12:14] <%Dopamien> make frens :)
[4:12:14] <ShogunRaven> @RyuuAoi Which boss is more bullshit than this?
[4:12:16] <+Shishi1205> Ancient wyvern is a cakewalk by comparision
[4:12:19] <emptyantics> Worst boss in the entire SERIES
[4:12:21] <%MrATheGreat> This is in fact the worst one
[4:12:21] <Treasure_Vault> Solaire went hollow during THIS bossrun.
[4:12:23] <shotgang86> now imagine if this boss could also walk around as originally intended
[4:12:23] <Equirah> chat, the reason they didn't finish this area is cause they had to playtest BoC
[4:12:28] <%Dopamien> monkaS
[4:12:29] <%Valask> jesus
[4:12:30] <subjectg> Honestly, the one fix they could’ve done to make the BoC an actually ok boss would’ve been to remove the jank ass collision on the arms. If you could actually roll through them everything would be fine
[4:12:31] <agustorm123> the run is what make this bad
[4:12:32] <mothdude> Ancient Wyvern is a fun setpiece.
[4:12:32] <Papa_Shu> p o i s e
[4:12:33] <tolloponik> HE GOT THE TAIL CUT?!
[4:12:33] <Dr_Mooose> monkaS
[4:12:34] <+TopTieramisu> monkaS
[4:12:36] <%LastHazzerd> "I like your cut G"
[4:12:36] <%Prevot> monkaS
[4:12:40] <andiwaffles> @RyuuAoi yeah I think gimmick bosses worked well in DeS because they were charming and that game's environments are more difficult than the bosses generally but, gimmicks do get worse each game
[4:12:43] <+SodiumPatrol> ! Ass at Risk !
[4:12:48] <%paladinstarbuster> little booty touch
[4:12:48] <iamtheTwitchghost> if you run all the way instead of walking near him you'll be able to do it
[4:12:50] <%mr_sups> IF he dropped there it would have been game over in his mind
[4:12:57] <%SarcFa> @anthropomorphictempest Literally no boss in DS2 is worse than this
[4:13:08] <ShogunRaven> LOL
[4:13:10] <%SarcFa> @anthropomorphictempest one area is worse
[4:13:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> More than armor he needs a shield with stability
[4:13:18] <glass_marcus> Nothing is the series is as bad as this
[4:13:20] <shotgang86> 2 tigers in the snow is worse
[4:13:20] <+TopTieramisu> @SarcFa no, but horsefuck valley is the worse area in souls history
[4:13:21] <%Ensign_Epic> Bed of Chaos is legitimately one of the worst bosses in gaming history
[4:13:21] <+Rafraud> light is a strat if you're good
[4:13:24] <Johannen> Did Woolie did heavy for his first playthrou?
[4:13:26] <iamtheTwitchghost> which attempt is this btw
[4:13:26] <anthropomorphictempest> @anthropomorphictempest That's what I'm saying. Like DS2 had a lot of gimmick bosses and none of them are worse
[4:13:26] <+TopTieramisu> worst*
[4:13:28] <tolloponik> the worse the bosses get in DS2 is boring
[4:13:29] <ShogunRaven> Bro, you tell me that 2 invisible tigers isn't terrible
[4:13:33] <%SarcFa> @TopTieramisu yeah, that's the one area
[4:13:36] <RyuuAoi> Ds3 final. Like can i attack? Okay no. Can iattack now? Okay never i guess
[4:13:36] <Arqartur0> what about Demon Souls?
[4:13:39] <oda_flobunaga> Bosses in DS2 are not worse then this. Its just that a ton of DS2 bosses are really boring
[4:13:42] <Johannen> @anthropomorphictempest Dragon?
[4:13:48] <%SaintBeau> DS2>>>DS3
[4:13:50] <subjectg> @sarcfa even then, with the right gear, frigid outskirts kirin can be stunlocked and farmed out of existence

[4:14:17] <shotgang86> sad naruto song
[4:14:19] <iamtheTwitchghost> this is 6 or 7th i think
[4:14:19] <+Rafraud> let it set in
[4:14:19] <andiwaffles> Dragon God is a gimmick boss it's just well thought-out compared to this
[4:14:20] <kingra> PunOko This boss
[4:14:20] <%MrATheGreat> I was bout to say that you were lucky you didn't get punished on that estus
[4:14:21] <ShogunRaven> 2 is the worst souls game with ease

[4:14:32] <daswampken> wile e moment
[4:14:34] <wqorst> ohno
[4:14:34] <peachy996> Because BoC is required
[4:14:38] <%Valask> life is a fuck
[4:14:41] <%swesterly> Lava bonfire reminder 93
[4:14:47] <radiorosewater> born to die
[4:14:52] <Deko_> thats true LUL
[4:14:52] <+TopTieramisu> gimmick bosses aren't inherently bad. i feel like demon's souls bosses are mostly fine, if a bit easy
[4:14:53] <Arqartur0> everyone Raise your arms to give energy to Reggie!
[4:14:54] <sporeian94> THE WORST SOULSBORNE BOSS
[4:14:56] <peachy996> "It's not you, it
[4:14:56] <Tempmael> we've all had our runs on this gimmick
[4:14:58] <%LastHazzerd> it's not worth it to beat yourself up over THIS boss
[4:14:58] <+guyremex> it's really not
[4:14:59] <andiwaffles> IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
[4:15:00] <%Ensign_Epic> Miyazaki apologies for this, Reggie.
[4:15:02] <radiorosewater> 1989
[4:15:03] <%paladinstarbuster> 100%
[4:15:06] <radiorosewater> kill em all
[4:15:07] <daswampken> the sass
[4:15:08] <subjectg> It really isn’t reggie this time, there’s no sweating this boss
[4:15:08] <peachy996> BoC: "It's not you, it's me."
[4:15:10] <%Lion_kun> This is the Dragon God of DS1
[4:15:12] <emptyantics> ITS NOT YOUR FAULT
[4:15:12] <Treasure_Vault> Remember what Woolie said at the start of the zone about time, and how they RAN OUT
[4:15:13] <GoatArmageddon> The boss just sucks ASS
[4:15:14] <Solidnick18> It's the boss design more or less
[4:15:15] <+SodiumPatrol> that 9 dmg tho monkaS
[4:15:16] <%holydeviant1> Reminder that the director has apologized for this boss @WoolieVersus
[4:15:17] <mothdude> Raindeer Hell is truly terrible, but it's completely optional so it's not worse than Bed of Chaos.
[4:15:19] <radiorosewater> \o/
[4:15:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:15:21] <QueequegTheater> Ancient Dragon and Lud&Zallen don't even compare because they couldn't be less optional
[4:15:21] <+Caboose2492> Platforming boss was maybe not the best for this game lol
[4:15:21] <subjectg> Just accept that it’s bs and you’ll be annoyed way less
[4:15:28] <%Lion_kun> He checkpoints the phases
[4:15:30] <LunarRemix> Yeah dead tired
[4:15:32] <shotgang86> the only boss where no one blames you if you die 90 times in a row
[4:15:36] <%Ensign_Epic> like unironically, the devs apologized for this boss
[4:15:36] <+DasBigHippo> Did anyone here play this on console release? This area was hell. The dragon legs down there would aggro you from literally the entire map away. It was horrible.
[4:15:37] <kailip> @TopTieramisu BoC would be bad even as a gimmick boss label though, cause the "gimmick" is basically dying or just doing firebomb setups lol
[4:15:37] <klooswep> Reminder that chat loves to remind people of things
[4:15:37] <%Lion_kun> It's the only boss in the whole franchise to do this
[4:15:38] <+Shishi1205> @QueequegTheater that is true
[4:15:39] <andiwaffles> I wouldn't tell Reggie that it's a regret now because he'll get too dejected to beat it maybe
[4:15:47] <Phrickshun> I gotta ask, does anyone really enjoy the "run back to boss" nonsense every time or am I the crazy one
[4:15:48] <%Valask> monkaS
[4:15:50] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus this boss is anti-johns
[4:15:50] <+Rafraud> Remember when Reggie asked if there was fun platforming and woolie for super hype?
[4:15:59] <%Valask> he's pitiying us
[4:16:00] <Solidnick18> i'm reminding of being reminded SeemsGood
[4:16:01] <%AceNugget> 80% dmg sumo slaps on a crumbling arena and there hasn't been a hint of where that boss healthbar's user is
[4:16:09] <Wofoeh> Oh yea, OG (PS3/X360) was fucking pain
[4:16:10] <%IronOhki> Do undead get tired, apart from going hollow?
[4:16:18] <+TopTieramisu> @kailip oh, i'm not defending BoC. i'm just defending gimmick bosses in general, since people throw that term in with bad bosses a lot
[4:16:24] <Treasure_Vault> Just put a minotaur, a taurus, and some stairs in the pit instead of instant death and it's just a normal boss fight.
[4:16:26] <%Dopamien> PogChamp 🔥 blarrghgh
[4:16:29] <andiwaffles> @IronOhki onion knight sleeps all the time I guess
[4:16:29] <emptyantics> @ironohki They have stamina lol
[4:16:30] <+Caboose2492> it's crazy how good DS1 is for the first half and the second half is just this
[4:16:34] <%JetpackMcQuack> they just like us really
[4:16:37] <pyjama_day> @TopTieramisu divine dragon in Sekiro was a good gimmick boss
[4:16:41] <%paladinstarbuster> Im happy elden ring has more fauna that doesnt immediately attack you
[4:16:42] <+Shishi1205> @IronOhki I think they are supposed to be zombies phys wise
[4:16:43] <oda_flobunaga> Who's fooling themselves saying this is the worst boss in the series.  Its is obvious that the worst boss in the entire series is either Fume Knight, Artorias, or Maria

[4:19:24] <+AkronymCLT> This is the best way to prepare for Stranger of Paradise
[4:19:24] <andiwaffles> This is objectively worse than Maneater which isn't a 'bad' boss but it made me angrier than this
[4:19:27] <a_mad_dragon_> you got the two veg, now get the meat
[4:19:29] <%Deasmeister> Miyazaki is sorry
[4:19:29] <+Shishi1205> no targeting
[4:19:30] <TheMadDemoknight> Target the undercarriage!
[4:19:31] <Papa_Shu> I wonder what percentage of people have beaten this idiot on their first try. It can't be many.
[4:19:32] <+cdrom321> @synthetic_sun It's exact. It's when the shoot the flamethrower at it.
[4:19:33] <anthropomorphictempest> miyazaki had a little too much dip on his chip when he made this
[4:19:34] <oda_flobunaga> NOT THE WORST. Maria or Artorias are the worst
[4:19:38] <+0neReeler> dragon god?
[4:19:40] <+BottledLineArt> It's not a boss fight - It's an environmental hazard with randomness.
[4:19:41] <oda_flobunaga> LUL
[4:19:43] <thefranchise00> kappa
[4:19:44] <+Tizona824> @oda_flobunaga spicy
[4:19:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You think the worst is over but the hard part is getting the rng for it to not kill you during the jump
[4:19:48] <daswampken> is it time to kill chaos?
[4:19:48] <%Rasheedt> @oda_flobunaga ???

[4:19:54] <%paladinstarbuster> @anthropomorphictempest i like that phrase LUL
[4:19:59] <shotgang86> Kill CHAOS
[4:20:00] <+0neReeler> CHAOS!!??
[4:20:00] <%Prevot> artorias the worst? an easy honest fight?
[4:20:00] <emptyantics> @oda_flobunaga Nice b8 LUL
[4:20:01] <oda_flobunaga> *Sarcasm*
[4:20:04] <+TopTieramisu> maneater is one of the more straight up boss fights in demon's souls
[4:20:08] <%Lion_kun> My record is 4 attempts I think.
[4:20:10] <FicboyOG> kill chaos!!!
[4:20:14] <+hybridfusio> @oda_flobunaga Artorias is badass
[4:20:19] <+Shishi1205> bro miyazaki had a hardon for this one fr
[4:20:20] <shotgang86> woolie bring Limp Bizkit its time to kill CHAOS
[4:20:21] <%Lion_kun> Although it is much easier with the quit out cheese.
[4:20:22] <%AceNugget> BoC on it's back kicking and flailing with every normal and CHAOS limb
[4:20:23] <Equirah> @oda_flobunaga difficult =/= poorly designed
[4:20:24] <+Shishi1205> He is a big masochist
[4:20:27] <peachy996> The other bonfire is stupid
[4:20:29] <anthropomorphictempest> @anthropomorphictempest it's the perfect way to describe this fuckery
[4:20:30] <kazadaz> Oh boy we're HERE
[4:20:32] <peachy996> This is the better bonfire
[4:20:32] <+2Vibe2Check> worst does not mean hardest
[4:20:32] <TheMadDemoknight> @oda_flobunaga I can't read sarcasm
[4:20:35] <andiwaffles> @TopTieramisu the arena is just fucked is all, and they flew away and never came back a couple of times for me lmao
[4:20:35] <%SaintBeau> @oda_flobunaga he's baiting
[4:20:40] <oda_flobunaga> Capra demon is the best
[4:20:41] <+TopTieramisu> excuse me. did someone just say maria is the worst?
[4:20:43] <%mr_sups> @daswampken Bullshit! SingsNote Rap Rock SingsNote
[4:20:45] <TheMadDemoknight> But man BoC is why I don't play NG++
[4:20:49] <peachy996> And if you like the other bonfire you are Bed of Chaos
[4:20:50] <+TopTieramisu> didn't realize chat wanted to throw hands
[4:20:50] <subjectg> You guys got baited hard

[4:27:59] <AvroEltz> Put some points in vit, that would def help in this fight
[4:27:59] <youngking_kush> Soul Spear?
[4:28:00] <%burquina> how far has reggie gotten on this fight? LUL
[4:28:02] <%vVAstrAVv> 8 SOUL SPEAAARZZZZ
[4:28:08] <%GrislyBoar> Steel Protection is an underrated ring.
[4:28:15] <+Shishi1205> int is good too
[4:28:15] <Equirah> @burquina 2 orbs
[4:28:15] <+Malysitos> The real BS is when BoC swipes you in mid air
[4:28:22] <pyjama_day> @AvroEltz vit wont save you from pit deaths, sad to say
[4:28:23] <+ATRodger> @burquina both sides hit, the floor is open
[4:28:26] <@Menitta> Is Soul Spear kinda like Eldritch Blast in dnd in how it stacks?
[4:28:31] <+Shishi1205> @Malysitos air combos
[4:28:38] <AvroEltz> @pyjama_day
[4:28:43] <andiwaffles> boss got true combos for days
[4:28:43] <%burquina> @burquina almost there, but biggest bullshit time
[4:28:47] <QueequegTheater> @Menitta It's just a very strong projectile
[4:28:54] <@Menitta> Ah
[4:28:54] <AvroEltz> @pyjama_day Yes, that was the joke
[4:28:57] <sosandstorm> will he binoculars when he needs to heal, what do we think?
[4:29:04] <+Shishi1205> piercing magic lance
[4:29:04] <stormhawk9891> No one tell him
[4:29:05] <%Dopamien> I feel like steel protection is placebo, the number crunch make sense but I still dont believe it does anything 😡
[4:29:07] <keigatide> is there a reason woolie isn't letting him know about the other way?
[4:29:15] <youngking_kush> @menitta You get more casts on spells buy equipping it multiple times
[4:29:17] <+Rafraud> yo points?

[4:29:36] <iamtheTwitchghost> hollowing FeelsBadMan
[4:29:40] <%A_German_spy> @Dopamien It definitely does work, but because there are are so many different damage types in this game, it's hard to actually feel a difference when you augment only one of them.
[4:29:41] <+Rafraud> man you're not wrong
[4:29:41] <velgaduere> @Dopamien this is the kind of insanity I like to see from Souls players
[4:29:43] <+Rafraud> lmao
[4:29:49] <TheMadDemoknight> Tell him. Don't let him suffer more
[4:29:52] <kazadaz> Oooooh, I thought he knew
[4:29:54] <stormhawk9891> awwww he noticed
[4:29:57] <Papa_Shu> damn
[4:29:59] <%A_German_spy> @Dopamien Or rather, when you augment your defense against only one.
[4:30:06] <%burquina> to be fair, this IS the most common reaction to Lost Izalith and this boss in particular
[4:30:07] <%vVAstrAVv> damn hes good lol
[4:30:08] <Equirah> @Shishi1205 estusaren't the issue in this fight and this way always costs 1-2
[4:30:21] <+Shishi1205> @Equirah not the way reggie is playing

[4:43:42] <%BignanasTheGawd> woolie, as soon as your friend says "I'm gonna hit the hands" is the point you gotta nudge him
[4:43:42] <+cdrom321> If he thinks he's supposed to attack something normally, he's giving the designers way too much credit.

[4:44:48] <DSD24> @andiwaffles Ludwig took me at least 20
[4:44:48] <Treasure_Vault> @andiwaffles I stopped counting on midir.

[4:45:10] <subjectg> @andiwaffles i think i took innumerable attempts on nightmare king grimm... wait
[4:45:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @2vibe2check i think it took them 3 hrs
[4:45:12] <urkleturtle> whenever the bean dad meme comes up, my mind keeps going to that "keep thinking about those beans" meme instead

[4:45:21] <pyjama_day> @andiwaffles I beat Ludwig first try with my blood build, but on my next character who used a stake driver, it mustve taken me like 50+ attempts
[4:45:21] <agustorm123> Midir probably 20+
[4:45:23] <@Menitta> I can increase it a bit
[4:45:25] <%IronOhki> @andiwaffles I think Sister Friede was my toughest.
[4:45:29] <+tomdwarf> Until he figures out the path, Im gonna keep voting no. After that, I'll start voting less.

[4:45:49] <+ATRodger> I needed Fextralife to beat BoC
[4:45:49] <%GrislyBoar> There's a reason seasoned veterans call this the bed of bullshit.
[4:45:52] <sosandstorm> if there was a button to skip this boss, I'd have said hit it
[4:45:52] <+Shishi1205> Getting used to midir and orphan etc needs either deaths or just running around them and observing

[4:50:38] <+Jiggisnipe> or worse Kappa
[4:50:41] <+0neReeler> hitboxes
[4:50:45] <dundore77> at least dragon god worked
[4:50:47] <Fireball_Spam> Bed of Chaos is one of the only bosses where its limbs act like objects instead of NPCs. Bed of Chaos thus pushes you instead of you rolling through it.
[4:50:47] <kikoeru_san> Absolutely NOT Miyazaki's vision
[4:50:59] <andiwaffles> @dundore77 I didnt have an issue with it either but friends of mine struggled
[4:51:00] <slackerunchained> You. Did it.
[4:51:01] <%Dopamien> he did it PogChamp
[4:51:02] <%Lion_kun> Best gimmick boss I would say is the Sekiro Dragon
[4:51:07] <Fireball_Spam> You thus get pushed mid-roll into the pits or get stuck on the hitbox until the i-frames are gone.
[4:51:07] <%jinking79> never come back
[4:51:10] <%RyTYoung> @dundore77 I don't know that it does...I was getting so frustrated with his bullshit
[4:51:12] <nintega010> the dragon god looks cool though
[4:51:14] <+Jiggisnipe> didn't no it was a puzzle boss
[4:51:17] <anthropomorphictempest> @Lion_kun Burnt Ivory King tho
[4:51:20] <available_line> Be wary of deadline
[4:51:20] <VincentGraves> i believe bloodborne is the only game that doesn't have a boss like this
[4:51:21] <kikoeru_san> I saw none of these mistakes, Reggie got it his first try as far as I know man
[4:51:21] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus Reggie still want to run through this again? lol

[4:51:48] <andiwaffles> I guess it's more a non-boss than a gimmick boss but if it could be considered a gimmick, The Maiden Astraea is the best one
[4:51:49] <%holydeviant1> His look of utter despair
[4:51:51] <Fireball_Spam> Dragon God is cool, and if you get into the tutorial part with it, you can tell that you won't be able to beat it conventionally.
[4:51:54] <%Lion_kun> BIK has a gimmick but you can beat him legit without tricks
[4:51:59] <%strakillias> In later games those EXACT hand models (the not moving ones) are where you need to swing at on a boss
[4:52:04] <420mangojuice> D:
[4:52:04] <Vookatos> More like bad of chaos
[4:52:08] <Fireball_Spam> @andiwaffles Storm King was a cooler gimmick boss, imo.

[4:52:22] <+GilroyGoldBlood> lmfao LUL

[4:53:17] <Fireball_Spam> Bed of Chaos is a cool boss, but it needed lava under the floor instead of death pits. If you had to climb up branches and wear the Orange Charred Ring fighting demon hordes, it'd be much, much better.
[4:53:21] <velgaduere> also Reggie: I HATE GIMMICKS

[4:53:58] <Fireball_Spam> @andiwaffles That almost felt more story than boss with scope. Storm King was the best balance of something "cinematic" but also unique in gameplay.

[5:08:28] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus On the bright side, we can now unequivocally agree that the worst is behind you, eh?
[5:08:37] <slackerunchained> Where's the parallel universe where J.J. Jameson *himself* is Spider-Man?
[5:08:38] <enerkaizer> @emptyantics Ben is my favorite Marvel hero. I actually lost interest in comics as a young kid when Marvel offed him, and I know for sure I wasn't the only one
[5:08:40] <+Jiggisnipe> idk
[5:08:42] <%quintonomo> Reggie sounds like a true dark souls fan
[5:08:56] <+Jiggisnipe> with the bs that it does, it would probably more annoying as a real boss
[5:08:57] <Awesome_Leaf> totally
[5:08:57] <+Mekhet09> Woolie is a terrible friend just letting reggie do this in his garbage heavy armor.

[5:39:48] <slackerunchained> NOT INVENTED HERE
[5:39:49] <%Irridium> Blazblue is as popular as strive now because of rollback
[5:39:49] <@Menitta> I absolutely hate how it's still a question of "will the online fucking work"
