[0:30:16] <legacy0117> Yeah that has been happening and is horrible. Even if the other person was around way before they started claiming.
[0:30:18] <discoinfierno> Well it was inevitable ever since they replaced the radio static with a trap beat
[0:30:18] <%Valask> @phistymcnutz56 did you spell it that way because of the date monkaS
[0:30:19] <%holydeviant1> @MyNameIsRasus "Your soul is mine!"

[0:34:29] <jetstreamlove_R> @Valask I would have ex uppercut that guy
[0:34:37] <Matrixvingian> The most weathered of aquatic mammals.

[0:34:39] <%dds333a> @phistymcnutz56 it like SOTC LUL
[0:34:40] <brunoberserk> thats all the weapons ?
[0:35:15] <legacy0117> It probably won’t. If it did exceed the display the life bar would likely change color.
[0:35:16] <Matrixvingian> Getting Hellpoint vibes with the sound design.

[0:39:39] <cartakus> Heredrim is going to be main character this time?

[0:43:33] <cartakus> audio seems fine for me
[0:43:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That Cathedral in Code Vein was so confusing
[0:43:51] <%holydeviant1> @Treasure_Vault The key is to be as linear as possible while maintaining an illusion of openness

[0:45:44] <%dds333a> Never
[0:45:57] <Matrixvingian> LET IT Die crossed with River City Ransom would be the perfect game for me. Just urban slappies and people disappearing into pocket change.
[0:46:00] <+Hollow_Mirage> The worst part is these stones look slick as hrll so in real life you’d slip off with the slightest gust of wind

[0:49:18] <+chase959> not the 8footer he probably is ment to be

[0:49:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Hit scan
[0:49:59] <%dds333a> they also arc too
[0:50:11] <%Indigo_Automaton> Honestly I dislike the super slow projectiles in Dark Souls
[0:50:12] <cooldude69xx> @chase959 I want it to be canon in Elden Ring that your character is 5' and all the giants are just kinda tall
[0:50:19] <+Tuffty> This area's like, "We know you Souls players love combat and desolate environments, let's amplify both of those things!"
[0:50:33] <%dds333a> @cooldude69xx only above average in height LUL
[0:50:42] <+chase959> it is the way @cooldude69xx
[0:50:49] <+hoenhime344> is that a clean shaven woolie?
[0:50:53] <%dds333a> stairway to heaven out here
[0:50:59] <legacy0117> Might need a shield if it gets too troublesome.
[0:51:20] <%dds333a> @legacy0117 Eredrim already has one Kappa
[0:51:33] <bigboy3d> you can't heal in this game?
[0:51:33] <legacy0117> Nice.
[0:51:36] <%sputnikbites> 2022 everybody's showing cheeks
[0:51:39] <TheProtomanBlues> is it me or it sounds like he is walking in snow
[0:51:42] <Lunalios> oh yeah...the aesthetic of those skin tight wears and big iudex gundyr helmet enemies looks kinda ugly ngl
[0:51:45] <prime_name> Why is Taki dressed up like a knight?
[0:51:49] <%dds333a> @bigboy3d yes, but not as conveniently
[0:52:15] <%dds333a> healing is done through consumables, parries, and by dying once and retrieving the shell
[0:52:32] <leomuratore> Damage taken while hardened will convert to health?!
[0:52:48] <legacy0117> Ah parry heals.
[0:52:52] <+hoenhime344> soooo this is the first time im seeing this game with armor and different weapons. i  thought it was all naked people and long swords
[0:53:03] <Lunalios> is like """"lore""""" in this game?
[0:53:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> oops
[0:53:08] <Pudgy_Pidgey> LUL
[0:53:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[0:53:12] <%dds333a> and as @leomuratore put it, some unique interactions also heal LUL
[0:53:12] <+Jiggisnipe> doesn't matter
[0:53:12] <Treasure_Vault> It's fine
[0:53:16] <Lunalios> anyway
[0:53:18] <TheProtomanBlues> LUL
[0:53:18] <leomuratore> You guys maxed out an item
[0:53:19] <Matrixvingian> Mysticism Lore or collission jank?
[0:53:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> 14 people
[0:53:21] <AganAOM> that's some source geometry right there
[0:53:21] <Darkdrill> LUL
[0:53:22] <%jepupu> In a Souls game that would've totally been a trap.
[0:53:25] <%dds333a> @lunalios there is
[0:53:54] <legacy0117> Lore in this game is unlocked with each upgrade the suits of armor you find.
[0:53:59] <+SouLucha> look out the other window
[0:54:19] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:54:29] <legacy0117> So the game heavily encourages you to grind to unlock all the lore.
[0:54:57] <Treasure_Vault> There's also secret lore you get by hitting random walls.
[0:55:01] <jetstreamlove_R> Soulslike teaching us to respect n fear the art of "Getting Jumped" LUL
[0:55:05] <Darkdrill> that was a nice parry
[0:55:10] <Matrixvingian> Hammer slapping wraiths gives this game a real appeal.
[0:55:15] <Treasure_Vault> Like hitting the statue base at the bottom of the stairs by the Sester is a secret lore thingy.
[0:55:33] <legacy0117> Oh that’s classic illusion walls for ya.
[0:55:50] <+karldeck> Gah, shaved Woolie and Reggie
[0:55:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> good shot

[0:56:31] <cartakus> Well you have a ranged weapon
[0:56:36] <%dds333a> @keiganofastora no
[0:56:41] <jetstreamlove_R> Even in Soulslike the power of gun is strong
[0:56:55] <+OrangeMDT> Well they gotta at least pretend it’s not like Dark Souls
[0:57:00] <Darkdrill> epic
[0:57:06] <cartakus> Nice
[0:57:18] <BeefJ1Rky> Why are the archers so hot?
[0:57:27] <%dds333a> @keiganofastora although, I've been told this is on the way? could be wrong LUL
[0:57:50] <Matrixvingian> This game's creators are getting free QA from Woolie.

[0:58:15] <TheProtomanBlues> Didn't someone in chat mentioned is second to last yesterday?
[0:58:19] <cartakus> Why should it be at the top?
[0:58:19] <%dds333a> @jetstreamlove_r the technique that separates the weak from the strong
[0:58:45] <Sadnehs> @cartakus  just because of darksouls, no actual reason
[0:59:01] <%dds333a> Jeezus
[0:59:03] <jetstreamlove_R> @dds333a  The one that seperates the sigmas from the betas LMAO LUL

[0:59:56] <Sadnehs> the contractor here was terrible
[1:00:03] <cartakus> A weapon to surpass metal gear
[1:00:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> its not cheating, Mortal Shellman just has a timestop drone
[1:00:18] <jetstreamlove_R> War evolved
[1:00:23] <Sadnehs> your hammer looks like a selfie-stick

[1:01:50] <Matrixvingian> Tele-toilets.

[1:02:33] <Treasure_Vault> Hit the Statue on the stairs by the Sester.
[1:02:36] <%dds333a> back to the bottom
[1:02:37] <Estuko> this level design reminds me o CONTROL with the ability to get really lost from The Path Of Neo that one level with the ant people.
[1:02:38] <cartakus> Compared to this the next zone is not gonna be the most challenging
[1:03:11] <+karldeck> Did they say why they are shaved?
[1:03:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:03:18] <%dds333a> the classic SMT dark zone comes later LUL

[1:04:05] <cartakus> How do you go down and up as a ghost
[1:04:06] <+JustToWatch> There's a big where if the ghosts stand still for too long they fall to the center of the earth
[1:04:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> turns out ghosts are real but they all just fell through the ground into orbit around Earth's core
[1:04:08] <%holydeviant1> >Ghost pops up speaking cantonese  "The fuck?"  >Ghost falls away screaming

[1:07:05] <%dds333a> @jetstreamlove_r it's also meant to be something like obsidian
[1:07:07] <Estuko> @holydeviant1 Oh uhhh, Atomic Skull I think,the green glowing nuclear skeleton guy ?

[1:08:09] <%hax_metatron> What a concept for a level, wasted with terrible enemy placement
[1:08:13] <Estuko> can you imagine coming standing guard listening to CSB podcast and a giant javeline sized arrow pins you to the wall out of nowhere instead of just walking around you
[1:08:27] <%Deekman> the case scenario the final boss of this game can be completed with a lute off
[1:08:28] <jetstreamlove_R> Bowsooka holds no tactical advantage, but fuck is it sick!

[1:12:08] <%holydeviant1> Good King Eredrin killed a loooootta people.
[1:12:46] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie picked up this shell right outside this area right?
[1:12:50] <Treasure_Vault> He's talking to your shell, not you.
[1:12:58] <+TwitchGuy2021> For this game I’ll just avoid talking for better immersion.

[1:30:16] <legacy0117> That, is how a crossbow should be made and used.
[1:30:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Does this game not have music?
[1:30:59] <%dds333a> @canadiananimatorguy it's understated
[1:31:14] <Estuko> @CanadianAnimatorGuy it does but I think it's copyrighted
[1:31:20] <legacy0117> Not in the combat areas, it’s Eurojanky like that.
[1:31:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Ahhh
[1:31:25] <%dds333a> Funny enough, this game does have a soundtrack option too, for bosses

[2:22:31] <jkiller994> that chisel is too powerful
[2:22:33] <drunken_lemur> People love glitch compilations. Developers should let their QA teams put them out officially to get people hyped for the game. Like a before and after scenario.

[2:22:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Burning Blade
[2:23:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @drunken_lemur They actually had that for a game, The Punisher
[2:23:07] <%dds333a> @drunken_lemur that's why I love the games that include glitch montages in them
[2:23:14] <%dds333a> @alteisenreisez exactly
[2:23:15] <+ItsRatman> I went to the bathroom and could hear Woolie's hyena laugh through the headphones, ty clippers
[2:23:32] <SlangPunk> @CoffeeKaiju Well he already has Bring Me to Life, he must use a stand disk for playing
[2:23:49] <DSD24> More games need you to just send people flying across the map
[2:24:10] <legacy0117> Wonder if that weapon can thrown as a spear.

[2:56:17] <%DensityD> You get 1/2 of a reincarnation
[2:56:18] <arkv01> you nailed it reg, they give you cybernetic limbs
[2:56:20] <+Jiggisnipe> does the small get legs?
[2:56:21] <%Deekman> Oh Reggie they aint going to heaven
[2:56:24] <Slim_Lipid> do conjoined twins have two souls? 🤔
[2:56:30] <+ArtemisCroc> do they have two different souls?

[2:57:17] <%DensityD> chat, what is the shape of Reggie's spirit?
[2:57:21] <Make_me_mad> Your souls aren't conjoined.
[2:57:25] <%hax_metatron> My spirit has a HUGE dick

[2:57:38] <+K4TL0N> Reggie's spirit is shaped like a chicken uwu

[2:58:13] <HarshNerf> speaking of second coming, do conjoined twins have shorter refractory periods?
[2:58:15] <%dds333a> you're just dead, sleeping

[2:58:44] <%cubbywolf> you gotta be buried right
[2:58:45] <arkv01> yo that sounds suspiciously like cryogenis stasis
[2:58:46] <%Deekman> you know what that wouldn't be so bad
[2:58:55] <%MightyDuckShoes> The soul is just the primitive understanding of conscience. Conjoined twins are just two people. That's why they're "con -joined"
[2:58:57] <%cubbywolf> LOOK THERE SHE IS
[2:58:58] <%dds333a> a new heaven, and a new earth
[2:59:02] <Grim1952> So is it reincarnation or you come back as is?
[2:59:04] <%SteinsApprentice> woolieVS  God real quick
[2:59:05] <%dds333a> or so they say
[2:59:06] <GoatArmageddon> Mortal Shell more like Mortal Jank am I right
[2:59:14] <+theoldone001> I like how we live in Heaven for 1000 years, but then God allows satan to be freed for one last battle because reasons.
[2:59:14] <%DensityD> big guy with the flattop
[2:59:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> wait heaven's temporary?
[2:59:31] <%MyNameIsRasus> that's crazy, never knew
[2:59:34] <legacy0117> Bible lore up in here. ^^
[2:59:35] <wawila> Use the range attack on this big enemies
[2:59:38] <%DensityD> cause he's big
[2:59:42] <%Renzaku69> @MyNameIsRasus In some beliefs its like a divine wating room until the earth is perfect
[2:59:45] <%dds333a> @theoldone001 gotta get the last judgement in
[2:59:49] <%hax_metatron> @theoldone001 If I don't get to take part in a HUGE badass battle of God vs Satan after I die, what is the point of ANYTHING
[2:59:51] <%DensityD> he wanted to....
[2:59:55] <+OrangeMDT> You know what, I don’t think Woolie is that religious
[3:00:00] <Dr_Mooose> LUL
[3:00:01] <Grim1952> Bye
[3:00:01] <%DensityD> weeeeee
[3:00:02] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL

[3:00:23] <legacy0117> So, hope you get Rapture or bad things happun basically.
[3:00:25] <DillWillCat> Real Talk if Crucix was in Dark Souls would his soul weapon be 2 handed or 1?
[3:00:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it is however the game decides it is
[3:00:34] <%cubbywolf> yes
[3:00:35] <%tank7013> That one guy totally was though
[3:00:36] <Tracazoid> Are they? Or is that the game just being consistently inconsistent. Maybe they ARE bound to the environment
[3:00:37] <%cubbywolf> no
[3:00:43] <%DensityD> teleports?
[3:00:45] <%cubbywolf> yes
[3:00:47] <%phistymcnutz56> maybe so
[3:00:50] <%Deasmeister> game pulled its jank sdt
[3:00:56] <%robosqueeb> this game is really good dogshit
[3:00:57] <GoatArmageddon> Doing it with duct tape
[3:00:59] <Grim1952> Schrodingers teleporter
[3:01:06] <%DensityD> needs more crow based transportation methods
[3:01:06] <Make_me_mad> The Heaven V. Hell final showdown is gonna be real anticlimactic when the demons show up ready to rumble, and the angels half-ass it due to overconfidence and centuries of one sided propoganda.
[3:01:14] <zhenthrim213> it is
[3:01:17] <+SmartAssPawn089> It got worse for me as well
[3:01:19] <%tank7013> It sure seems to be
[3:01:32] <%DensityD> kick kick kick kick kick
[3:01:33] <%cubbywolf> idk i think it was always like this
[3:01:35] <dsmastodon> You can feel the money running out as you play...
[3:01:36] <%midsommar29> It’s just a spike it’s stabilizing
[3:01:36] <%DensityD> mighty boot
[3:01:37] <+SmartAssPawn089> Made for some great laughs tho
[3:01:42] <DillWillCat> The Sun isn’t gone… it’s bugged.
[3:01:43] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Front loaded af
[3:01:45] <+OrangeMDT> @dds333a well he has tattoos for one Kappa
[3:01:46] <%hax_metatron> @Make_me_mad Don't worry everyone will come back Avengers style and help us in the end
[3:01:47] <+LastHazzerd> but you refreshed, right?
[3:01:48] <%DensityD> YOU'RE a memory leak
[3:01:58] <+LastHazzerd> you rebooted the game? or did ya just go to the menu
[3:02:03] <%Renzaku69> yooo im late, Amazon warrior ladies
[3:02:06] <Grim1952> This area sucks in dark mode
[3:02:07] <%phistymcnutz56> @WoolieVersus the integrity of the game depends on the twiceborn being alive I guess LUL
[3:02:08] <%cubbywolf> those high heels cant help their footing
[3:02:10] <Make_me_mad> @hax_metatron But 99 percent of the people coming back are gonna be fighting FOR hell!
[3:02:12] <%DensityD> yeet the chisel at ladies
[3:02:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hope enough people bought this game for them to make a sequel with waaaayyyy more polish
[3:02:14] <%hax_metatron> I want Gandhi manning the bazooka in Heaven vs Hell
[3:02:17] <%cubbywolf> every area kinda sucks in dark mode imo
[3:02:21] <%dds333a> According to the bible, god insta wins anyway, by just raining down fire on all those fools LUL
[3:02:22] <foghornleghorn55> They're such huge fans of dark souls 1 they made the final areas broken in tribute
[3:02:40] <zhenthrim213> @hax_metatron what do you nean he has the nuclea codes
[3:02:43] <+theoldone001> Jesus comes back first, we all go to Heaven. Satan is locked away and the AntiChrist is destroyed, then we live in heaven for 1000 years. Then Satan is freed and it's one last fight then it's the final judgement and Satan is locked away forever this time, maybe, until God gets bored in eternity and frees him again who knows.
[3:02:48] <DillWillCat> Crucix was a load bearing boss.
[3:02:52] <Make_me_mad> The ultimate Dark Souls tribute: Make the entire second half of your game shit.
[3:02:53] <%cubbywolf> what
[3:02:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait was there a third guy?
[3:02:57] <%cubbywolf> DOUBLE PARRY?

[3:09:55] <DillWillCat> Crucix was holding back the Jank and now it is unleashed.
[3:10:03] <%Renzaku69> at least its janky but not like the same enemy over and over

[3:10:37] <penitentpendant> @DensityD Understandable
[3:10:55] <%DensityD> Woolie makes this look easy

[3:11:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> that hammer stab is so goofy lol
[3:11:12] <%DensityD> lute
[3:11:19] <%dds333a> @densityd for the most part LUL
[3:11:30] <%cubbywolf> oh talking to her heals you too
[3:11:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @DillWillCat
[3:11:34] <+TheOlMitcheroo> @ReallyBigRocks They should stab with the chisel and hammer it in
[3:12:00] <%hax_metatron> @WoolieVersus There aren't any here
[3:12:07] <penitentpendant> @TheOlMitcheroo It'd make an interesting 'grapple attack'
[3:12:10] <%DensityD> good heal from weltcap, high familiarity
[3:12:21] <DillWillCat> New Memories = New Jank
[3:12:23] <bujiraso> @woolieversus there should be a quick change to the Hammer & Chisel just outside this whole area. Unless you got it already
[3:12:25] <+Jiggisnipe> oh now I get it, the maps post gland are dark Anor Londo inspired probably
[3:12:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> @TheOlMitcheroo even just adding a little spike to the hammer model would make more sense
[3:12:34] <+OrangeMDT> Frog chests only in the forest
[3:12:37] <%Renzaku69> Impractical strength weapons look so cool, that is straight up just a block of stone on a stick XD
[3:12:37] <+TheOlMitcheroo> True
[3:12:45] <%DensityD> when woolie finished that guy off with the chisel fastball, and he went into his standard death anim. I was upset. no ragdoll for large models

[3:29:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> you do have it
[3:29:39] <bujiraso> it's not IN the game?
[3:29:40] <+Reverend_Roscoe> WAIT THATS THE END?!
[3:29:43] <%hax_metatron> NOOO that's just a Roguelike mode
[3:29:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just like dark souls
[3:29:45] <DXLelouch24> you have it, new weapon and shell
[3:29:46] <%MyNameIsRasus> DLC is roguelike mode I THINK
[3:29:53] <bujiraso> yeah it's just a roguelike mode. nbd. later stuff
[3:29:54] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> you have to talk to the hole now
[3:29:58] <a_mad_dragon_> it's right in the area with the weapons
[3:30:02] <Reborn2killu> theres also a new shell
[3:30:03] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> BOSS SOUNDTRACK
[3:30:04] <cartakus> Dlc is a rogue like mode with a shell and a weapon
[3:30:06] <DillWillCat> Mortal Content
[3:30:09] <%DensityD> golden ratio rotation
[3:30:10] <+checkmate023> if he hadnt passed, i wouldve sworn that voice actor was leonard nemoy
[3:30:15] <Treasure_Vault> There's a shell, a weapon, and a mode.
[3:30:24] <%Bread_Assassin> There’s a 5th shell and weapon in the DLC.
[3:30:24] <bujiraso> DLC is a whole nother game mode, not in the same narrative
[3:30:28] <jkiller994> wait thats the end?
[3:30:28] <cartakus> The rogue like mode is just in the menu
[3:30:32] <LunarRemix> DLC Is just a roguelike mode, it's not a new area or anything like that
[3:30:35] <%DensityD> reggie make a funny face while searching the wiki
[3:30:43] <%ShevatEternal> @WoolieVersus If you have it it's not active.  There would be more up top with the weapons
[3:30:44] <bujiraso> thanks @lunarremix  o/
[3:30:44] <Afrosamasenpai> Just do it in your own time, it's worth it!
[3:30:46] <HarshNerf> @checkmate023 nemoy stretched out his dialogue more
[3:30:47] <+Reverend_Roscoe> is that the end of the game?
[3:30:48] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus second floor of tower is DLC
[3:30:52] <Afrosamasenpai> Rotting Christ is rad.
[3:30:53] <DXLelouch24> new shell and weapon
[3:30:53] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> shit
[3:30:57] <Treasure_Vault> Lie
[3:31:01] <Treasure_Vault> There's shell and weapon too, I think
[3:31:03] <%cubbywolf> DLC says there's a shell, a weapon, and a new gamemode
[3:31:12] <%DensityD> illusory wall ahead
[3:31:15] <DXLelouch24> find Hadern
[3:31:15] <Reborn2killu> where you are is where the dls is
[3:31:17] <Treasure_Vault> Is that a dude?
[3:31:20] <bujiraso> @afrosamasenpai I liked it but clearly no one told them it was a loop. it cuts HARD
[3:31:24] <Treasure_Vault> Nevermind.
[3:31:26] <%ShevatEternal> @WoolieVersus There would be more NPCs here with the weapons if the DLC was active
[3:31:27] <%DensityD> woolieONEGUY
[3:31:28] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> the last boss is where the prisioner was
[3:31:34] <jkiller994> is the game over?
[3:31:37] <bujiraso> Extra shell is in the roguelike?
[3:31:39] <DillWillCat> Proceed to Hole
[3:31:43] <cartakus> Menu
[3:31:44] <MrEli111> @woolieversus it would be next to dark fog man.
[3:31:46] <%DensityD> the cycles of guilt from E.Y.E. divine cybermancy?
[3:31:47] <+ImExtremelyManly> nah we got the final boss left
[3:31:48] <%cubbywolf> do you have harden?
[3:31:48] <bujiraso> it's not here if I understand
[3:31:58] <%cubbywolf> Hadern can be found on the second floor of Fallgrim Tower after collecting the Smoldering Mace, Martyr Blade, and the Hammer and Chisel weapons. You can then talk to him and will then be prompted to "One Last Glimpse" which will be a final battle with Hadern himself using his weapon, the Axatana. Defeat this two-stage boss battle to unlock his shell for the Foundling to use.
[3:31:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:32:04] <%DensityD> this hole...it was made for me
[3:32:08] <DillWillCat> You have UNO!
[3:32:11] <@Solidus_113> we don't have uno
[3:32:15] <Afrosamasenpai> @bujiraso aww boo that sucks
[3:32:16] <%hax_metatron> It's just Roguelike with a new weapon and shell. Nothing special. The shell is HADERN.
[3:32:18] <+theoldone001> Enter your natural habitat Woolie
[3:32:18] <Maids4lyfe> the woolie hole?
[3:32:20] <MrEli111> @woolieversus it's the Virtuous cycle.
[3:32:22] <bujiraso> FREE upgrade????
[3:32:26] <bujiraso> tell me everything
[3:32:38] <DXLelouch24> does PS5 ver not have DLC? thats fucked up
[3:32:43] <%DensityD> didn't the game Blasphemous teach you?
[3:32:51] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> enter za hole
[3:32:54] <%hax_metatron> Hole?
[3:32:56] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> bites za dusto
[3:33:00] <+Mrbaconator> the woolie hole
[3:33:00] <SainEdge> the dlc was only free when it came out, i think it costs like 8 bucks or so
[3:33:01] <%hax_metatron> The.... Hole?
[3:33:01] <lloyddboy> I <3 Hole
[3:33:03] <%cubbywolf> doesnt look like dark souls DLC
[3:33:04] <+CeeSaw> DONT BE A COWARD ENTER THE HOLE
[3:33:05] <DillWillCat> Hole is Goal
[3:33:11] <%cubbywolf> SOON BUT HOLE
[3:33:15] <%DensityD> try tongue but hole
[3:33:18] <Owlboy7> just get in the hole, dlc is shit LUL
[3:33:19] <@Solidus_113> there should be a statue at the top of the stairs where you swap shells @WoolieVersus
[3:33:19] <bujiraso> @woolieversus I just jumped in to the hole. I didn't do any extra stuff in this mode
[3:33:25] <BlackermanZX> do ya have to download it or sumthin
[3:33:26] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> where there is a hole, there is a goal
[3:33:27] <%hax_metatron> Roguelike cycle mode
[3:33:41] <jkiller994> just enter the hole woolie
[3:33:50] <bujiraso> @solidus_113 👂👂
[3:33:53] <%DensityD> this is almost as nebulous as the entrance to Dark souls 1 DLC
[3:33:53] <DXLelouch24> you unlock dlc after you get all weapons so shouldnt be too late
[3:33:53] <cartakus> After I guess
[3:34:04] <+ImExtremelyManly> is it at the smae level as the merchant or higher
[3:34:08] <%cubbywolf> it seems like it's DLC so you can new game + it without it being sekiro
[3:34:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hurray for dlc foibles
[3:34:19] <Reborn2killu> yeah after you get all the weapons it unlocks
[3:34:26] <ExpressNode> DLC hole
[3:34:30] <DXLelouch24> weapon and shell is cool so id get it
[3:34:34] <MyManFlint> its not worth that tag
[3:34:42] <+zeejaymac> Virtuous cycle reads like a remix of the main game
[3:34:43] <bujiraso> @dxlelouch24 geeeeeez what's with the "Hiding things you bought" stuff
[3:34:45] <Victory_Boss> This is my favorite part of the playthrough
[3:34:47] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> The hyyyyype!
[3:34:48] <zzNamttamzz> It was free if you owned the game when it came out
[3:34:49] <Treasure_Vault> Dunno if it's worth it, just shell and weapon
[3:34:51] <%Deasmeister> Eh not worth it
[3:34:52] <%ShevatEternal> @WoolieVersus You get a roguelike mode.  In the base game you get another Shell and Weapon type
[3:34:52] <cartakus> Just a shell and weapon
[3:34:53] <%cubbywolf> you get a shell and weapons
[3:34:54] <%midsommar29> It was free for first month
[3:34:56] <+Jiggisnipe> people also said Hadern's shell and weapon
[3:34:57] <KiwamiKiryu> not worth it
[3:34:57] <%DensityD> is there any new lore content in the roguelike mode?
[3:34:58] <HarshNerf> new shell and weapon you wanna see that
[3:35:00] <MrEli111> @woolieversus it's just roguelike and mostly the forest. new weapon and shell.
[3:35:00] <Tumier> PJSalt
[3:35:03] <DXLelouch24> and a axetana trick weapon
[3:35:04] <%cubbywolf> free with twitch drops too... LUL i hate drops
[3:35:07] <+LastHazzerd> Award Winning you say
[3:35:13] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> axetana is the best weapon
[3:35:14] <Treasure_Vault> And axetana. You're about to beat the final boss, no need to dlc at this point unless you're loving the game.
[3:35:17] <+theoldone001> It's a new shell and a new weapon, it's good for replayability but otherwise no new major content, no new bosses and no new areas.
[3:35:18] <KiwamiKiryu> It gives you MORE forest
[3:35:20] <@Solidus_113> https://mortalshell.wiki.fextralife.com/Hadern,+the+Deliverer
[3:35:26] <@Solidus_113> https://mortalshell.wiki.fextralife.com/Hadern+the+Deliverer
[3:35:27] <%cubbywolf> yeah, why get it right at the end?
[3:35:29] <DillWillCat> HOLE was beside me all along.
[3:35:30] <DXLelouch24> you have to beat him
[3:35:31] <HarshNerf> @cubbywolf drops are cool
[3:35:31] <%cubbywolf> you'd have to level him up
[3:35:33] <Reborn2killu> and a new weapon
[3:35:35] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Axetana is a word I never knew I needed
[3:35:44] <SainEdge> dlc is fun, even if the content (levels and enemies) is basically the same
[3:35:46] <MrEli111> @woolieversus you have to fight him.
[3:35:49] <cartakus> Hardern is a cool guy
[3:35:50] <%RyTYoung> Axetana?!?!
[3:35:54] <bujiraso> does anyone know if there's in mode narrative world content left? it's just the menu mode for roguelike right? what's this top of the stairs bit?
[3:35:59] <Reborn2killu> trick weapon
[3:35:59] <%cubbywolf> well if you have to fight him to get his shell thats cool
[3:36:01] <zzNamttamzz> Axetana is the best weapon vut you don't need it
[3:36:02] <cartakus> Yup Trick weapon baby
[3:36:06] <+LastHazzerd> an Axe that's been folded over 10,000 times
[3:36:11] <MrEli111> @woolieversus and he too will be sitting on the second floor
[3:36:14] <@Solidus_113> not quite artorias dlc, sadly
[3:36:19] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Reggie’s face intensely curious
[3:36:25] <%cubbywolf> soon but hole
[3:36:28] <HarshNerf> an axe that's chopped into a katana 10000 times
[3:36:30] <+LastHazzerd> well this game is not quite dark souls
[3:36:30] <DillWillCat> Mortal Hole
[3:36:31] <+Jiggisnipe> Axatana looks cool
[3:36:36] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> its basically Let it Die after floor 40
[3:36:44] <%cubbywolf> 50/50 it doesnt work
[3:36:46] <%RyTYoung> Now I just wanna add tana to different weapon names, nunchutana's, hammertana I could go on for days
[3:36:47] <bujiraso> oh there's no place to trigger the roguelike in additional content! how the heck does it work!?
[3:36:50] <okramv> they done with the base game?
[3:36:55] <Reborn2killu> yeah
[3:37:03] <BlackermanZX> Bazookatana @RyTYoung
[3:37:05] <DSD24> @okramv Almost done I think
[3:37:06] <bujiraso> .... where

[3:37:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> Is it that guy with the lantern on his hand?
[3:37:30] <%cubbywolf> sometimes I restart steam
[3:37:32] <+ArcanumArcanum> might need to restart the game?
[3:37:34] <%RyTYoung> @blackermanzx you win my good sir!
[3:37:37] <%DensityD> what a great pack
[3:37:51] <MrEli111> @woolieversus might have to restart the game after installing it.
[3:37:53] <bujiraso> @woolieversus I also had installation issues with the Rotting Christ DLC, so you are definitely not wrong to be checking what you're checking. worthwhile to investigate the PS menu side of things
[3:37:55] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> yare yare daze
[3:38:18] <%cubbywolf> usually, the DLC is installed already and you just gotta pay money to turn it on but steam sometimes has trouble turning it on

[4:13:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah, the time-worn souls-like tradition of making a boss with adds, bless
[4:13:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> @kulmoth ain't that this whole game
[4:13:22] <Fabpsi_> with those waves it looks like a rythm game
[4:13:23] <%dds333a> They're around for heals

[4:14:28] <+Jiggisnipe> if you can parry
[4:14:28] <+ArcanumArcanum> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ these adds die in one hit and act as parry bait so you can heal, so it's actually way better than souls add boss fights

[4:16:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> rom the vacuuous turkey

[4:16:59] <LunarRemix> @kewlmyc There's no leveling only weapon upgrades, which Woolie's capped
[4:16:59] <%dds333a> @kewlmyc this game doesn't have levels like that anyway

[4:31:16] <%dds333a> Killing the fire keeper is a perfectly acceptable pastime
[4:31:28] <bujiraso> This game has such a high ceiling in concept and such a reasonable implementation that it kind of hurts
[4:31:31] <%dds333a> Like testing damage numbers on the doll Kappa
[4:31:45] <SainEdge> yeah, hope that the team gets it in the next game. Its a solid first game, with a lot of potential for a sequel

[4:32:51] <Treasure_Vault> It's clear to see why they're still called Soulslikes.
[4:32:53] <Wyldesquirrel> @MajorCrasher Maybe in DS3 and somewhat in DS2. but Demons and Dark1 Items were a total mystery
[4:32:57] <%MajorCrasher> they do not unless you already know what the game jargon means
[4:33:03] <bujiraso> @obotolken begrudgingly but also excitedly
[4:33:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @OboTolken there's another one??

[4:33:17] <bujiraso> @majorcrasher I'm with ya, it's very "in lore" descriptions
[4:33:23] <OboTolken> @cobalt_phoenix_ Nonono, there is not
[4:33:27] <+Jiggisnipe> @cobalt_phoenix_ I think they mean if they make a 2nd one
[4:33:29] <%dds333a> @cobalt_phoenix_ he means hypothetically
[4:33:36] <OboTolken> @cobalt_phoenix_ I meant like a theoretical sequel

[4:33:53] <%DillWillCat> JANK Points
[4:34:02] <bujiraso> @woolieversus is 100% right. there's a sudden stop of the sensation of levelling at mid to late game yeah
[4:34:12] <%MajorCrasher> none of the soul items tell you how many they give you
[4:34:12] <OboTolken> @bujiraso The game seems like it has good ideas, but just needs to take another crack at the execution
[4:34:18] <%DensityD> FAMILIARITY
[4:34:20] <bujiraso> @obotolken  100%
[4:34:43] <bujiraso> @densityd the familiarity system feels GREAT on paper, AwFuL in the hand
[4:34:50] <LunarRemix> Even Sekiro does that
[4:34:51] <cartakus> Just like the surge 1
[4:35:02] <lonosis47> I respect wools opinion but i just dont see how its better than Dark souls
[4:35:10] <%DensityD> geez I keep remembering Shammy's review of the Surge and the Surge 2
[4:35:22] <bujiraso> (uh did Woolz say this is better than Souls ever)
[4:35:25] <Fabpsi_> The Warframe of Dark Souls. Getting into shells, abilities for each character, special stats
[4:35:31] <+SouLucha> I only really liked the harden ability.
[4:35:33] <%RyTYoung> A little bit of resooooolve is what I need nooooow SingsMic
[4:35:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:35:36] <%DensityD> how do I Prime my Lute?
[4:35:37] <bujiraso> (hard [x] to doubt)
[4:35:45] <Fabpsi_> !motivated
[4:35:45] <@Moobot> @Fabpsi_ 2449 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:35:46] <lonosis47> He definitely implied it bujiraso
[4:35:55] <cartakus> Combat is def better
[4:35:57] <%DensityD> same tricks, we love these tricks
[4:36:02] <bujiraso> No way! I'm surprised, @lonosis47
[4:36:06] <LunarRemix> @lonosis47 You're crazy he did not
[4:36:06] <%DillWillCat> Mortal Shell 2 now with 3 new instruments to master
[4:36:23] <%RyTYoung> @dillwillcat and co-op to get a band going Kappa
[4:36:25] <HarshNerf> lute minigame
[4:36:30] <bujiraso> @dillwillcat as it slowly devolves into Lute Hero: Aerosmith
[4:36:35] <Fabpsi_> but looking at the title. All of the janks are enhanced janks!
[4:36:41] <BlackermanZX> if they do mortal shell 2 dear god make a better starting zone
[4:36:44] <%DillWillCat> Lute Drum, Lute Flute, Lute Lute
[4:36:47] <%DensityD> still need a highlight of the entire sequence starting with "this screenshot tells me nothing..." and going to the chisel fastball jank
[4:36:50] <bujiraso> @woolieversus can confirm losing parry is not funny alone at home
[4:36:51] <+SmartAssPawn089> I laughed super hard by myself, held together by scotch tape and spit
[4:36:54] <%DensityD> THE TWICEBORN
[4:36:57] <cartakus> NO make another forest
[4:36:58] <%RyTYoung> just imaging a co-op group all being shit with their instruments and how funny that shit would be LUL
[4:37:13] <bujiraso> That! would be goofy, @rytyoung
[4:37:16] <SainEdge> its also like 20 bucks on full price
