[0:00:45] <T_Sasquatch> EVELYNN GANK PLEASE
[0:00:52] <+Karmahurts> Top Die
[0:00:55] <ivanmistwalker> FED HAS CONSUMTION
[0:00:56] <%DensityD> wow! where do I get the Pokemon MOBA?!?!
[0:00:57] <bearwagon> mid or feed
[0:01:01] <dinnydanny777> It looks awful
[0:01:03] <+cvp5127> i erased that from my memory
[0:01:04] <%Prevot> minh, the one person whos excited for it
[0:01:04] <%ChoculaUltra> "omg, this Mewtwo just isn't ganking. gonna throw."
[0:01:08] <%emperordread> 0/1/0 report this scrub toxic flame
[0:01:09] <dinnydanny777> It's just League of Legends
[0:01:11] <T_Sasquatch> Ban yasuo plz
[0:01:49] <%DensityD> is every toxicroak pick a toxic player?
[0:01:53] <+Grandnatics> What MOBAs do you play, Mihn?
[0:01:56] <+jiggy_snipe> Minh likes DMC2 so he dgaf Kappa
[0:01:57] <GarbageNirvana> I need to get hands on it
[0:01:57] <T_Sasquatch> I had to stop playing league when i first played in rank and found out my 200 hours mean nothing
[0:01:58] <%emperordread> Snorlax is fed
[0:02:04] <%ChoculaUltra> Nintendo has canonically always been late to their own money making parties. It's crazy.
[0:02:07] <BlackermanZX> its kinda crazy
[0:02:08] <%DensityD> AT LEAST WE ARE GETTING POKEMON SNAP 2
[0:02:10] <dinnydanny777> Yeah who would have expected Nintendo to be ten years behind everyone else?
[0:02:15] <ExpressNode> Pokemon League of Legends
[0:02:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> Where's the Pokemon kart racer???
[0:02:28] <%DensityD> but I have to ask.....when is pokemon Fatal Frame?
[0:02:32] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean Nintendo owns 1/3 of the company so...
[0:02:34] <%ChoculaUltra> hell, a pokemon autochess game would've made millions had they pulled the trigger during the auto-chess craze tbh
[0:02:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> when are we getting a pokemon fighting game
[0:02:41] <BlackermanZX> if theres no infernape imma throw it in the trash
[0:02:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what
[0:02:50] <T_Sasquatch> I still don't get auto chess
[0:02:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> @cobalt_phoenix_ PokShadowmew
[0:02:59] <%DensityD> MOBA is too close to legalized cock fighting than they wanted
[0:03:01] <+jiggy_snipe> most mobas don't work
[0:03:09] <TigerClaws12> KoF characters as guests
[0:03:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh riiiiight pokken
[0:03:27] <%ChoculaUltra> autochess is like a super passive form of mobas/rts imo. You plop units down, thy do the thing, you buy/upgrade till you lose or win. Low investment fun.
[0:03:39] <TigerClaws12> there was an Iori as a guest character in a moba
[0:03:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok then pokemon class based shooter when
[0:03:55] <BlackermanZX> i hope that pokemon game doesnt have riot levels of spaghetti code
[0:03:56] <%ChoculaUltra> @cobalt_phoenix_ now you're asking the real questions
[0:04:15] <T_Sasquatch> Mobas are very easy to conceptualize but you can't compete with mobas now
[0:04:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1293070990046572547?s=19
[0:04:26] <+NY_JDash> Yo, what
[0:04:28] <%emeraldskrull> WOOLIE! woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:04:29] <T_Sasquatch> Br is the new brainless game type
[0:04:30] <+NY_JDash> what's up?
[0:04:36] <%ChoculaUltra> I'd probably throw money on a pokemon themed Diablo clone tbh. Just anything that's not the same Red/Blue/Gold/Silver formula ad nauseam tbh.
[0:04:39] <+jiggy_snipe> SNK wants all the guest characters
[0:04:44] <dinnydanny777> Pokemon made a billion
[0:04:46] <DatAsuna> so tem tem
[0:04:50] <dinnydanny777> Pokemon have a billion dollars
[0:04:51] <+cvp5127> that would require effort
[0:04:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sounds cool
[0:04:52] <ExpressNode> Should just have a MMO
[0:04:59] <ExpressNode> With all the regions
[0:05:08] <dinnydanny777> Pokemon is one of the most successful franchises on Earth, they don't need money
[0:05:14] <T_Sasquatch> Pokemon DOESN'T NEED TO FIGHT
[0:05:14] <%RyTYoung> Just started FF XIV this month
[0:05:19] <T_Sasquatch> Its pokemon
[0:05:21] <%wunp_fxs> which is wow ff14 and the other one
[0:05:22] <ChinMusicTwo> You gotta compete with Old School Runescape its tough out there
[0:05:25] <%ChoculaUltra> WoW's hold has been crumbling since Cataclysm. Hence why they stopped giving out sub count reports since Cataclysm lmao.
[0:05:26] <%bread_assassin> They missed their shot at an MMORPG.
[0:05:31] <+jiggy_snipe> ESO is the other one
[0:05:33] <%emeraldskrull> Pokemon+shadow of the collossus+animal crossing=billion dollars
[0:05:34] <BlackermanZX> does PSO2 count
[0:05:40] <%DensityD> COCK FIGHTING, YOU LOVE IT
[0:05:41] <+jiggy_snipe> PSO2 I guess too
[0:05:42] <dinnydanny777> Oof, imagine competing with Maple Story
[0:05:44] <+cvp5127> LUL
[0:05:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pokemon shlooter but instead of guns it's pokemon with random stats
[0:05:51] <DatAsuna> GW2 and swtor are still around too
[0:05:51] <%DensityD> jk I'm sorry
[0:05:53] <dinnydanny777> Imagine having to compete with Adventure Quest Worlds
[0:05:59] <%Prevot> I hate mmos so I dont want that
[0:06:00] <dinnydanny777> How would they ever win
[0:06:08] <+jiggy_snipe> it's pokemon, they'll get so many players on name alone
[0:06:09] <T_Sasquatch> Pokemon go was an era just because it was pokemon
[0:06:11] <+Aeoneth> Here me out... Pokemon GTA
[0:06:11] <ExpressNode> Tem tem kind of showed us a template in how a online pokemon game could have looked like right?
[0:06:19] <dinnydanny777> Pokemon Smash
[0:06:25] <dinnydanny777> Pokemon Warriors
[0:06:26] <%ChoculaUltra> after playing pso2 for the past few days, I've realized like 99% of the Asian action mmos in the same vein have all been trying to recreate pso2 for their respective audiences. It's wild.
[0:06:30] <dinnydanny777> Pokemon Fifa
[0:06:33] <dinnydanny777> Hear me out
[0:06:45] <%DensityD> At least we are getting Pokemon SNAP! 2
[0:06:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @dinnydanny777 i think you're onto something
[0:06:54] <%OldManJEWc> Sup people
[0:07:00] <BlackermanZX> Megaman Soccer style pokemon game kolMagma
[0:07:05] <+cvp5127> too hard
[0:07:07] <T_Sasquatch> Maybe a pokemon game with actual development ? LUL
[0:07:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie just wants third person pokemon
[0:07:09] <dinnydanny777> You mean Pokemon Snap?
[0:07:11] <+EternalJedi> over the shoulder third person
[0:07:18] <GarbageNirvana> So Yokai Watch
[0:07:19] <+Grandnatics> Why not something more out there?
[0:07:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that sounds cool tbh
[0:07:20] <+EternalJedi> I could go for that
[0:07:22] <+Grandnatics> Pokemon Strikers
[0:07:25] <+Aeoneth> Pokemon, Death Stranding
[0:07:25] <dinnydanny777> Game Freak don't understand three dimensions Woolie
[0:07:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pokemon FPS, let's go! GIVE PIKACHU A GUN
[0:07:31] <SomersaultJustice> isn't the wild area basically that?
[0:07:34] <%ChoculaUltra> Remember when Nintendo announced Pokemon Snap 2 in 2020 and not 2000?
[0:07:36] <dinnydanny777> Game Freak are incapable of comprehending three dimensions
[0:07:40] <%ScreamLord> Pokemon SNAP 2
[0:07:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil no pikachu IS the gun
[0:07:42] <dinnydanny777> @somersaultjustice No
[0:07:43] <DatAsuna> so the tv ads
[0:07:44] <%Raymanguy13> Raymanguy13 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[0:07:54] <+Grandnatics> Pokemon Sports Games: Soccer, Basketball, Baseball, be weird!
[0:08:00] <ivanmistwalker> WHY PAT?
[0:08:06] <T_Sasquatch> Pokemon will NEVER progress because it sells well with minimal effort
[0:08:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cobalt_phoenix_ I SAID WHAT I SAID
[0:08:20] <%ChoculaUltra> as much as I want a pokemon sports game - if the animations in the mainline pokemon games are anything to go by, a sports game would look like utter garbo.
[0:08:25] <%Jetzord> Like what people thought Sw&SH were going to be?
[0:08:31] <+cvp5127> they already have a billion tho
[0:08:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil wait wait, hear me out... pickachu with a gun that is ALSO pikachu
[0:08:39] <dinnydanny777> Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best selling video game on the Nintendo Switch
[0:08:43] <%Prevot> the problem is that not doing any of that is already a billion dollar idea
[0:08:44] <dinnydanny777> games*
[0:08:45] <+EternalJedi> @WoolieVersus Gamefreak doesn't understand how that owuld be good
[0:08:53] <BlackermanZX> pikachu with a gun is just shadow the hedgehog
[0:08:58] <dinnydanny777> Game Freak are boomers and do not care
[0:08:58] <%emeraldskrull> pokemon+ shadow of war
[0:09:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cobalt_phoenix_ son, I need that rat to wield an SSG >:C
[0:09:09] <%ChoculaUltra> lmao, remember Sword and Shield "boycott?" Talk about shit that ages like milk.
[0:09:24] <T_Sasquatch> Pokemon fans are just consoomers
[0:09:28] <+EternalJedi> people apparently complained about Gen 5 being too hard and they took a hard turn in the wrong direction
[0:09:28] <+Grandnatics> @ChoculaUltra FULL garbo animations, get shoulder checked by a Wingull QB
[0:09:30] <+jiggy_snipe> does any game boycott work?
[0:09:34] <dinnydanny777> Masuda said it best, kids these days don't want to play video games, only want to play mobile phone games, and have no attention spans so we made the games like that
[0:09:45] <%MrAtheGreat> Ah, from Fire Emblem Fates to Echoes?
[0:09:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> because they can get away without making major changes because "it's pokemans i gotta buy the new pokemins"
[0:09:56] <%ChoculaUltra> @Grandnatics the getting tackled animation would literally just be the model going 90 degrees in one direction and laying there.
[0:09:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ChoculaUltra almost like a very vocal minority whined about a game that would be incredibly successful LUL
[0:10:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> More like Pokemkn Bored and...idk what rhymes with Shield
[0:10:11] <dinnydanny777> Let's not act like Sword and Shield was a good game.
[0:10:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> POKEMON DATING SIMUL-- no, wait, that's too far
[0:10:26] <dinnydanny777> People bought it because people buy anything, it wasn't a good game
[0:10:43] <ExpressNode> The biggest leap I've think they made was probably Black & White and Black 2 & White 2.
[0:10:43] <DatAsuna> Good skyboxes are important
[0:10:47] <+ladomania> you can zoom in in MMOs lmao
[0:10:47] <%Jetzord> Is Pokemon Crater still a thing?
[0:10:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sword and Shield would be really impressive if this what 2006
[0:10:52] <%DensityD> WoW has tons of looking up, it's just that players never bother
[0:10:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> Hear me out: Pokemon x Halo
[0:10:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil you know damn well some people would pay for that
[0:10:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> *if this was
[0:11:00] <%DensityD> everything is modeled in WoW
[0:11:02] <DatAsuna> SWTOR has some great skyboxes
[0:11:06] <+EternalJedi> "COllect them all" good luck with that in SwSh
[0:11:12] <%ChoculaUltra> @FuqBoiSlim that is the most apt review of Sword and Shield I've seen LUL
[0:11:19] <%themanski_90> themanski_90 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months!
[0:11:20] <%JuliusGemstone> JuliusGemstone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months!
[0:11:32] <DatAsuna> bomberman mmo
[0:11:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:11:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cobalt_phoenix_ some things just can't ever be given life
[0:11:42] <%Jetzord> Fuck the budget, Game Freak need to give a shit first
[0:11:54] <dinnydanny777> @fuqboislim 2006 really? With the Ocarina of Time trees and the worse animations than Stadium?
[0:12:03] <%ChoculaUltra> you guys heard about Sam Fisher being the next Operator in Rainbow Six Siege? Just give us a new Splinter Cell game lmao
[0:12:05] <+EternalJedi> if BUDGET is the issue for a POKEMON game, I have to question WTF they're doing
[0:12:06] <+jiggy_snipe> I don't think that would fly
[0:12:10] <%DensityD> standing in barrens, doing /dance
[0:12:12] <DatAsuna> As woolie always says: "Tighten up the graphics on level 3"
[0:12:13] <%afronooch> graphics don't matter, but they kinda do
[0:12:17] <Zayasu> I think they should just outsource stuff to bamco since they have such a small team
[0:12:23] <+Grandnatics> If Game Freak could keep consistent features and QOL improvements between games, that they've ALREADY developed, this could be a real convo
[0:12:23] <%MrAtheGreat> They need to make a pokemon stadium, then bring those models and animations into the main games.
[0:12:23] <Spydurman> graphics matter to a degree
[0:12:28] <dinnydanny777> Pokemon Colosseum came out on the Gamecube in the early 2000s and it blows Sword and Shield out of the water graphically
[0:12:29] <+EternalJedi> afronooch graphics matter. hyper realistic graphics do NOT
[0:12:35] <%afronooch> exactly
[0:12:38] <%eanscrale> At long as you don't have a pot with more polygons than a character
[0:12:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> Okay, I'm gonna point out something people are forgetting: Pokemon is a brand with multiple things firing at the same time. TPC is ALREADY struggling with the standard games
[0:12:45] <T_Sasquatch> Halo inifinte got delayed because of a meme LUL
[0:12:54] <+EternalJedi> afronooch better phrasing, graphics don't matter, ARTSTYLE matters
[0:13:03] <%ChoculaUltra> tfw Pokemon Go has better animations than Sword and Shield
[0:13:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> REGGIE, LET ME GET YOU TO PLAY GW2
[0:13:06] <dinnydanny777> Have you seen the water textures in Colosseum? That game is gorgeous compared to Sword and Shield
[0:13:07] <SomersaultJustice> reggie confirms temtem playthrough
[0:13:07] <%OldManJEWc> Temtem?
[0:13:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @T_Sasquatch craig is almighty
[0:13:10] <DatAsuna> Also the gameplay has been stale for 20 years and the SMALLEST improvement you can make is 2 vs 2 standard like coloseum
[0:13:10] <brunoberserk> Wooli vs mmorpg
[0:13:16] <+EternalJedi> afronooch Tales of games will ALWAYS be pretty
[0:13:17] <%MrAtheGreat> I’m not into mmos myself.
[0:13:19] <%afronooch> also yes @EternalJedi
[0:13:24] <Spydurman> Pokemon where your friends can come into your game would be top tier
[0:13:31] <+EternalJedi> WInd Waker will ALWYAS be pretty
[0:13:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> @EternalJedi you god damn right they will
[0:13:44] <+EternalJedi> CappuccinoGuil limesOk
[0:13:46] <+gnoame> You can mess with both of those ideas with the Minecraft Pixelmon mods. Seeing pokemon in first person was great.
[0:13:49] <masterfire23> sao pokemon
[0:13:56] <%ChoculaUltra> art style will always transcend graphical limitation.
[0:14:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, indies are coming after that pokemon game. Temtem, Ooblets
[0:14:01] <%Jetzord> Wait, how about this, Pokemon Dark Souls
[0:14:10] <dinnydanny777> The only way Pokemon will be good again if Game Freak are still making it, is if it goes back to being 2D
[0:14:14] <%Rosewater_444> !uptime
[0:14:14] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 25 minutes and 42 seconds
[0:14:16] <+Grandnatics> Money doesn't matter as much as budget
[0:14:18] <dinnydanny777> Game Freak are incapable of making 3D games
[0:14:21] <+EternalJedi> CappuccinoGuil and a Pokemon-like coming on Switch later this month, the name escapes me but it looks good
[0:14:25] <dinnydanny777> They don't know what they are doing
[0:14:28] <ExpressNode> It only got saved by good planning (and also a lot of money)
[0:14:31] <+jiggy_snipe> Square will burn money
[0:14:31] <%ChoculaUltra> they really don't.
[0:14:37] <%Prevot> Pokemon Company would never remake a failed mmo
[0:14:49] <%Prevot> they would drop that shit quick
[0:14:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> @EternalJedi awesome LUL
[0:14:59] <%ChoculaUltra> it's like all these old ass franchises don't understand their own legacy 99% of the time.
[0:15:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> Squeenix is used to losing money tbf lmao
[0:15:08] <%afronooch> Yoshi-P
[0:15:15] <%ChoculaUltra> a console pokemon game should've been the second coming of jesus for gamers tbh
[0:15:26] <Zayasu> street fighter needs a yoshi p LUL
[0:15:33] <+Grandnatics> The REAL "monster collecting" game is coming to Switch: SMT Nocturne baby
[0:15:33] <dinnydanny777> FF is fucking healthy, but it could have easily fucking died a few years ago
[0:15:36] <TallPixels> yessir
[0:15:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> What they need is to give themselves time, man
[0:15:52] <DatAsuna> also NOBODY MAKES MORE MONEY than pokemon
[0:15:54] <dinnydanny777> How many years are there between FFXIII and FFXIV becoming good, lmao
[0:15:54] <T_Sasquatch> It wouldn't even run on the switch LUL
[0:16:02] <%DensityD> welcome to pokemon podcast
[0:16:02] <%eanscrale> minimize effort MAXIMIZE PROFIT
[0:16:03] <+FackinCrazy> so better digimon world
[0:16:05] <DatAsuna> the cheapest purse strings on the biggest purse
[0:16:05] <%ChoculaUltra> as long as Kingdom Hearts and FF7 fans exist Square will never be out of money.
[0:16:07] <+zanzibar_junker> The new FF14 story patch was fucking great though
[0:16:11] <+EternalJedi> @WoolieVersus look up a kickstarted game called Kindred Fates
[0:16:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> is it even about money or is it the fact the company is ran by dinosaurs and they make this shit yearly?
[0:16:25] <%Rosewater_444> Rosewater_444 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from robobeau!
[0:16:27] <dinnydanny777> Miltank
[0:16:28] <SomersaultJustice> miltank
[0:16:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dude, 3 years between games is NOT enough
[0:16:37] <+jiggy_snipe> she will rollout on you
[0:16:40] <+cvp5127> Kappa
[0:16:47] <dinnydanny777> That pokemon Meowth drank from in that one fucking terrifying clip from the anime
[0:16:52] <+Grandnatics> Reggie => Milk Pokemon
[0:16:53] <+Grandnatics> Kappa
[0:16:57] <dinnydanny777> Meowth drank straight from a Miltank's titty
[0:17:05] <%ChoculaUltra> Meowth bout that life
[0:17:06] <dinnydanny777> That got put in the anime
[0:17:08] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:17:10] <dinnydanny777> Somehow
[0:17:11] <DatAsuna> I stopped at gen 3
[0:17:16] <+jiggy_snipe> bunch of bs from fake fans Kappa
[0:17:20] <DatAsuna> then i played the silver remake
[0:17:24] <%eanscrale> Remember how long HMs stuck around.
[0:17:25] <%DensityD> hahaha woolie you fool, you are a fake fan haha jk
[0:17:26] <+EternalJedi> @WoolieVersus played since Yellow and played Sword, you are 100% correct
[0:17:29] <DatAsuna> i bought alpha sapphire but never played it lol
[0:17:31] <dinnydanny777> Gen V is where Pokemon died
[0:17:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> I haven't played an actual Pokemon game since Moon I've been playing romhacks since
[0:17:35] <+Grandnatics> @WoolieVersus They already made Pokken for you
[0:17:42] <%ChoculaUltra> the craziest thing about pokemon to me is how often they implement new mechanics and immediately drop them in the sequel. RIP Mega Evolutions - you were genuinely cool.
[0:17:53] <%DensityD> he wants pokken 2
[0:18:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> You're fucking Pokemon? sweetc2Gasm
[0:18:06] <dinnydanny777> Gen V is the last game made with any kind of passion or ingenuity, every game after feels like it's been churned out by people who no longer care about what they are making
[0:18:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> Mega Heracross and Pinsir were so based. its not fair
[0:18:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'm with Geoff (Mother's Basement) on this. We keep forgetting pokemon is a huge bran with dozens and dozens of projects
[0:18:22] <dinnydanny777> None of the games made after Gen V feel like they were made with love and care
[0:18:25] <+ladomania> yeah smt
[0:18:29] <+EternalJedi> with the Cassettes
[0:18:30] <ExpressNode> Why do that and just get SMT
[0:18:33] <dinnydanny777> They feel like they were churned out to make money

[0:18:43] <MAX116030> I was so frustrated when 8-4 guys described whole thing "Fans just complaining that game has bad exture"
[0:18:44] <+EternalJedi> forget the name

[0:18:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> @jorniev oh yeah, Bugsnax is pretty much a Pokemon-like
[0:19:07] <%ChoculaUltra> pokemon manga is fucking insane. Red really is the greatest trainer to ever pick up a pokeball.
[0:19:11] <dinnydanny777> Bugsnax is nightmare fuel pokemon, even more than real pokemon
[0:19:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Bugsnax is far too cursed

[0:23:15] <%stevo_scar> @woolieversus hard run now?
[0:23:19] <%MrAtheGreat> BIG GROW
[0:23:23] <dinnydanny777> Parry so good that your enemies shit their pants
[0:23:29] <kenny_biff> woolie master samurai?
[0:23:31] <%ChoculaUltra> I love the concept of Terrifying Parry. Your perfect parry was so hyped, your enemies are literally shooketh LUL
[0:23:33] <%jorniev> ACTUALLY USEFULL
[0:23:34] <%MrAtheGreat> Shoulder charge is actually pretty useful
[0:23:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> @mrathegreat YEET!
[0:24:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> never really used the delayed attack much
[0:24:25] <dinnydanny777> WIND STANCE IS SICK
[0:24:25] <%OldManJEWc> You can actually do juggle combos with shoulder charge > Concentration + Firing arrows
[0:24:32] <dinnydanny777> Wind stance has a KICK
[0:24:38] <%Halospaz117> Wind Stance also has the Sweet Jin Music
[0:24:40] <dinnydanny777> Wind stance has a fucking LAUNCHER
[0:24:45] <%ChoculaUltra> but Moon Stance has 2 kicks!
[0:24:49] <+cvp5127> spin to win
[0:25:09] <+gnoame> all coward weapons available

[0:25:15] <Parapattern> Golf without Limits Stance
[0:25:26] <%OldManJEWc> Moon stance kicks > Wind stance kicks
[0:25:37] <%Halospaz117> @ChoculaUltra Can't claim credit for it, saw it on twitter
[0:25:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:25:37] <%OldManJEWc> kick only run when? Kappa
[0:25:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> He's got plenty of Honor Now & Honor Later
[0:26:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YES THAT'S SO FUN
[0:26:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer540 howdy, I used to be LewdSkeletor13, but I changed my name because I’ve lost all hope in humanity. Unrelated, but have you read Immortal Hulk? 6 volumes of it are out, best comic out there atm. Eldritch, body horror Hulk that pulls from religious imagery is the sickest. Keep being awesome
[0:27:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @doomerskeletor13 I saw that Hieronymus Bosch shit
[0:27:16] <Hammatime8> Oooo, that looks GOOD.
[0:27:25] <BlackermanZX> damn thats a good color
[0:27:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> why are you white
[0:27:28] <brunoberserk> SO WHITE
[0:27:28] <Parapattern> Woolie got the Cool Jat
[0:27:33] <Parapattern> *Hat
[0:27:42] <+halfsquare> that's a lot of unlocking for still being in part 1
[0:27:52] <%Halospaz117> @doomerskeletor13 Misanthropy ain't no reason to abandon lewdness my dude, if anything, become more lewd to spite the world
[0:28:03] <%bread_assassin> If his Samurai Clan armor is at level 3, shouldn't it have those big shoulder pads?
[0:28:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolie MinhMaxed for this one
[0:28:22] <Djinnazz> Not using the supply 2x charm?
[0:28:26] <%doomerskeletor13> @bread_assassin You can unequip them
[0:28:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus did you get any other major charms?
[0:28:31] <MAX116030> Im kinda bumped that Woolie plays on normal not realizing how easy it is
[0:28:40] <brunoberserk> 40 % of time , works everytime
[0:28:48] <%MrAtheGreat> ... Something tells me woolie’s gonna like Gosaku’s :)
[0:29:01] <nintega010> @MAX116030 I figured he would. I switch to lethal right when I got the chance
[0:29:16] <MAX116030> @nintega010
[0:29:31] <nintega010> @MrAtheGreat Gosaku's armor was my armor until I got Ghost
[0:29:38] <+CptBritches> @Halospaz117 I like the way you think
[0:29:53] <%MrAtheGreat> The good ones I foun were on the second island
[0:30:00] <%DesertPenguin> I like the new outfit
[0:30:21] <@Menitta> How far in sushi
[0:30:23] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s too hard to tell the good ones from the meh ones
[0:30:29] <%MrAtheGreat> @nintega010 Same lol. Ghost is so freaking good.
[0:30:39] <MAX116030> @nintega010 finny cuz when Maximillian played on Lethal he found way easier since though you get hurt harder you still hit much more others
[0:30:41] <%DesertPenguin> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[0:30:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WOOLIE
[0:30:43] <%MrAtheGreat> @menitta end of first area
[0:30:45] <%wunp_fxs> WOOLIE!
[0:30:46] <+CptBritches> BAN WOOLIE RIGHT NOW
[0:30:50] <%BisoromiBear> HE DID THE THING

[0:30:52] <%doomerskeletor13> WOW
[0:30:53] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie and his horse abuse
[0:30:54] <@Menitta> Thanl
[0:30:54] <%Halospaz117> @Menitta Still in Act 1, Woolie offscreened the Mongol Camps and faceless white missions
[0:30:55] <%bread_assassin> BETRAYAL
[0:30:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> NOOOOO9O
[0:30:57] <%DesertPenguin> I'm calling PETA

[0:31:11] <BlackermanZX> Ghost of PETA
[0:31:11] <supersugoisenpai1> Digital deluxe ghost
[0:31:11] <%Halospaz117> HONOR DIED HERE
[0:31:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> YOU DEMON
[0:31:13] <%DesertPenguin> "Hello, PETA? Yes, I'd like to register a complaint?"
[0:31:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Last stream: I don't wanna give them any ammunition This stream: immediately hits horse
[0:31:25] <%stevo_scar> peta would finish the job
[0:31:29] <%doomerskeletor13> Peta would just kill the horse guys
[0:31:29] <brunoberserk> horse killer of tsushima
[0:31:36] <%DesertPenguin> Oh I know LUL :(
[0:31:38] <DatAsuna> it's pretty obvious which ending they're getting... eventually
[0:31:40] <@Menitta> Do NOT fuck with them bears
[0:31:40] <Parapattern> We need to make it 100% clear that this samurai has NO honor whatsoever
[0:31:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Glue Factory of Tsushima
[0:31:48] <nintega010> @MAX116030 I think lethal is harder cause enemies are more aggresive
[0:31:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Bears will fuck you up if you don’t dodge
[0:31:51] <ultimatecoma> max would call you a scrub lord
[0:31:53] <TheLemuroid> Bears have the most honour
[0:32:00] <Hammatime8> Don't worry, the horse only received EMOTIONAL damage!
[0:32:01] <%MrAtheGreat> BLOW THAT BEAR TO SHIT
[0:32:08] <%wunp_fxs> dead dog
[0:32:11] <%Halospaz117> THIS IS HOW YOU HUNT WITH HONOR
[0:32:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Harvest it’s pelt after you blow it up
[0:32:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THATS A DOG
[0:32:13] <%jorniev> HONOR MISSILES
[0:32:18] <@Menitta> HONOR
[0:32:23] <Hammatime8> Instant bacon! :D
[0:32:26] <%Halospaz117> Headshots my dude
[0:32:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Blazing with honor
[0:32:32] <kenny_biff> first horse abuse, now dog explosions
[0:32:37] <%stevo_scar> headshots are one shots
[0:32:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1293070990046572547?s=19
[0:32:39] <+CptBritches> This is the stream where Woolie causes his horse as much pain as possible
[0:32:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Snuff that pup
[0:32:53] <Djinnazz> Yes they do.
[0:32:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Max short bow does 1-hits
[0:32:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can oneshot bears with halfbow headshot
[0:33:05] <%MrAtheGreat> The half-bow one hit kills boars and dogs at level 4 i think
[0:33:08] <%doomerskeletor13> It took a few shots for me too to kill boars
[0:33:10] <pi_in_the_sci> Headshots kill bears in one even without the upgrades
[0:33:16] <%jorniev> SNUFF THAT UP with EXTREME PREJUDICE
[0:33:38] <MAX116030> @nintega010 it depends on how comfortable you are, again animation priority is block so you always have chance to block, anyway it depends on player
[0:33:44] <%MrAtheGreat> know what I love? Headshots are always a lethal kil.
[0:33:55] <%DensityD> rumble Kreygasm
[0:34:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh wow I didn’t know that and I’m almost done with the game lmao
[0:34:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh yeah i forgot they added a visual indicater
[0:34:10] <%DensityD> minh wants the harder rumble Kreygasm
[0:34:15] <%MrAtheGreat> Thanks for updating after I beat the game Sucker Punch
[0:34:18] <+FackinCrazy> the bugs were added in anupdate
[0:34:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @MrAtheGreat ikr?
[0:34:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Ohh ok
[0:34:38] <dinnydanny777> That's a good use of an update
[0:34:38] <%eyezehuhh> yo all
[0:34:41] <nintega010> @MAX116030 yeah. since I played stealth I killed everybody fast & also I got really good with the combat.
[0:34:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Whenever I wasnt in a camp or dueling I wore the travelers attire
[0:34:57] <%stevo_scar> any more target trophies?
[0:35:10] <nintega010> @MAX116030 Did max play stealth or more combat heavy
[0:35:30] <+ProxyFox12> Every time I see short lines like that I check to see if it’s a haiku
[0:35:31] <%MrAtheGreat> I'm gonna boomer up and say I prefer trangulating the directions of the wind instead of the green bug, just to spite the young'uns
[0:35:31] <+VoytekBus> unfogging the map is the funnest part of the game IMO
[0:35:32] <+xdeathknightx> If I did missions I would wear armor, when removing fog of war just travellers
[0:35:59] <%doomerskeletor13> I love this big hat lmao

[0:36:40] <Idon__> Don't you start off with a pure white headband?
[0:36:47] <%ButcherPorky> Enjoy boys.
[0:36:49] <MAX116030> @nintega010 a bit more combat but the deal is combat felt way too short on lethal, he wanted to have more back and forth with enemies
[0:36:53] <%Irridium> they desire blood
[0:36:54] <Parapattern> Woolie, we both know that you just want a Naruto headband
[0:37:01] <Hammatime8> @idon__ Nah, it has some fancy trim
[0:37:02] <%doomerskeletor13> The animals want a bloodbath
[0:37:14] <%MrAtheGreat> YEYEYEYY
[0:37:16] <Idon__> Ah, I see.. Guess he doesn't like the pure intent one either
[0:37:22] <%MrAtheGreat> BAMBOO STRIKES
[0:37:33] <+chiazam> There's nothing besides the bamboo here for him rn
[0:37:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Honestly I loved the bamboo strikes, they’re satisfying
[0:37:41] <%DensityD> BAKA SURVIVOR
[0:37:42] <Idon__> dropped combos smh
[0:37:45] <%DensityD> SingsNote

[0:38:06] <nintega010> @MAX116030 hmmm. not even on hard I think I had a back and forth, but that's probably just me.
[0:38:07] <%jorniev> gg reggie
[0:38:10] <TallPixels> yosh~
[0:38:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> Yatta!~
[0:38:23] <%vextalyst> vextalyst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hey woolie can't think of a recommendation this month so another random question. What is the weebest thing you'd actually wear irl? For example if they made an Attack on Titan cloak that actually protected you from the rain i's wear it in a heart beat.
[0:38:25] <%Prevot> oooh shiny
[0:38:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now on top of BIRD we have BUG
[0:38:35] <+ProxyFox12> There should be a place where you can practice cutting bamboo as long as you want
[0:38:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wait, what is that green bug? Was that patched in?
[0:38:41] <+chiazam> Doesn't the Traveler's armor have a better indicator now?
[0:38:43] <%doomerskeletor13> Man, would’ve been nice if they added these firebugs before I finished most of the game lol
[0:39:07] <%jorniev> he one of the dead now
[0:39:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the firefly is a new addition to travelers armor added to help indicate a thing is nearby
[0:39:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Corpse nothting
[0:39:24] <+chiazam> battle?
[0:39:44] <%jorniev> wrong

[0:40:39] <%OldManJEWc> Wait, so Woolie is fine with the mind goblins of the travelers outfit, but Ms. Mows is a no go? woolieOMG
[0:40:47] <%Halospaz117> Did anyone else ever have it where they fell off a cliff and died, but the revive skill still worked for some reason?
[0:41:01] <TallPixels> i think you gotta press circle right before you land. Too early and you don't roll
[0:41:03] <%doomerskeletor13> Birb
[0:41:05] <+chiazam> I've never seen that
[0:41:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @oldmanjewc It's a hot-cold you don't have to activate
[0:41:17] <Parapattern> That sounds AWFUL
[0:41:20] <%MrAtheGreat> Yeah. the artifacts stay
[0:41:27] <+chiazam> The items are still there
[0:41:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait does anyone know if the last patch fixed the ammo bug with onsens?
[0:41:34] <supersugoisenpai1> Some get burned down
[0:41:50] <MAX116030> I gotta say one thing that unfortunately Woolie makes really annoying is his reliance on Map. Like He keeps looking at Map more then anyone I ever saw
[0:41:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DOSHO

[0:43:01] <Parapattern> Man that break in the hat over the eye looks cool
[0:43:07] <Idon__> When the camera gets Jin's eye through the slit, it's pretty cool.
[0:43:12] <DeepSearch27> I love how reasonable she is
[0:43:25] <%Halospaz117> Yeah Yuna's cool

[0:45:22] <kenny_biff> woolie has no idea what that hat is doing to my ocd NotLikeThis
[0:45:30] <nintega010> lol
[0:45:32] <%DSD24> The hat is cool
[0:45:42] <Hammatime8> "Jin, I SAW you kill all those Mongols before that firework hit me in the face. I KNOW it was you!"
[0:45:50] <%DesertPenguin> Oh nooo Hat clips through bow
[0:45:52] <%DesertPenguin> Can't unsee
[0:45:58] <%Halospaz117> I preferred that one Straw Hat, I think it was called the Patchwork Straw Hat? Was kinda Raiden-ish
[0:46:03] <%doomerskeletor13> The hat makes Jin look like that bounty hunter guy from Clone Wars
[0:46:13] <%DSD24> @Halospaz117 That one is pretty Raiden ish
[0:46:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cad bane?
[0:46:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck yeah black dye merchant
[0:46:40] <%doomerskeletor13> @cobalt_phoenix_ Nah there’s another guy with a big hat, Tembo is his name or something
[0:46:46] <Idon__> Lol I rocked black traveler's outfit, with a black hat and a black horse.
[0:46:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:46:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh i gotta look that up
[0:46:52] <%Prevot> white is just a different flavor of edgy
[0:46:57] <%Halospaz117> @DSD24 Yeah, no matter how many other Straw Hats I found, that's the one I always went back too. Tended to use headbands more later on though
[0:47:08] <Idon__> "huh, guess those screams were my imagination"
[0:47:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> @prevot It's Paladin Edge. Virtue Edge.

[0:47:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Noise wasn’t invented back then
[0:47:25] <%DSD24> @Halospaz117 I tended to roll with the Swordmaster hat its just clean looking
[0:47:30] <SomeAsianDood> Huh the rain sounds like Josuke screaming Kappa
[0:47:34] <T_Sasquatch> Tanto
[0:47:36] <Idon__> the max ronin level hat is cool
[0:47:44] <%MrAtheGreat> tyanto is knife size
[0:47:55] <%DSD24> I always kept a mask on
[0:48:03] <%MrAtheGreat> wakisashi is dagger sized
[0:48:04] <%OldManJEWc> Tanto is a dagger. Wakizashi is more of a short sword
[0:48:09] <%eanscrale> Yeah tonto is like dagger short
[0:48:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i wanted to run with the hat woolie has or the black version of it, but it kept bothering me that the whole face was hidden
[0:48:20] <SomeAsianDood> Tanto is what majima has right?
[0:48:26] <%doomerskeletor13> I think so
[0:48:28] <%MrAtheGreat> @SomeAsianDood yes
[0:48:36] <%Halospaz117> @DSD24 That one's good too, went well with the white dyed ronin suit for a Samurai Jack look

[1:15:00] <MAX116030> The great wall, I LAUGHED so HARD when I saw trailer for that movie. As A Kazakh from Central Asia I found it so funny that whole premise of the movie "Wall was build to stop ferocious monsters" Like Yeah you can describe us like that
[1:15:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:15:03] <%Halospaz117> I haven't watched Last Samurai, but isn't the Last Samurai in that movie not Tom Cruise? And also meant to be plural?
[1:15:04] <T_Sasquatch> I just googled the great wall LUL
[1:15:05] <%Prevot> weaboo is OUR word

[1:15:22] <%DensityD> MORE JOHN WILLIAMS MUSIC
[1:15:27] <+VoytekBus> jin sounds at least 37 years old
[1:15:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> The one where Jin is sad and the horse nudges him, clearly going "hey buddy, you alright?" is great
[1:15:32] <Make_me_mad> Why the fuck would you leave such an amazing character concept on the table.
[1:15:38] <+gnoame> Yeah I was looking at the great wall, hilarious that one of the suggested search was "Why was Matt Daemon in The Great Wall"
[1:15:38] <%jorniev> YASUKE should be in more video games
[1:15:50] <%jorniev> YEAAAH
[1:15:54] <Make_me_mad> I will forever love Nioh for including Yasuke and making him a gigantic badass.

[1:16:11] <Zehdre> Nier:A's second title drop at route C is the shit.
[1:16:21] <%BonewheelVanguard> The one were your napping with the horse is the actual best
[1:16:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Until Dawn did that I think. Or something like that
[1:16:24] <%jorniev> @DatAsuna YEAAH
[1:16:40] <T_Sasquatch> Tales of the borderlands is stellar. Its so much better than it has any right to be
[1:16:54] <MAX116030> Yasuke not only the first non Japanese Samurai but the trust worthy guard of Nabunaga. How this is not a movie?
[1:17:04] <%MrAtheGreat> LEVEL UP
[1:17:08] <%doomerskeletor13> I think Batman season 2 or Tales from the Borderlands are tied for my favorite Telltale game

[1:18:21] <%Halospaz117> "My hat dick is bigger than your hat dick"
[1:18:38] <%doomerskeletor13> @buttsoup_barnes WB (well, AT and T) basically gutted a lot of their business’, so DC was hit by major layoffs
[1:18:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> Honorable frontal assault from the natural boundary no one could ever pass
[1:18:43] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:18:46] <%BonewheelVanguard> Does size of hat denote authority
[1:18:53] <%Halospaz117> To be fair, the Ishikawa one is Jin talking about Ishikawa having a stick up his ass
[1:18:59] <%MrAtheGreat> I got ishi and Yuna one time. Real no brainer there
[1:19:07] <%doomerskeletor13> All my homies hate Ishikawa
[1:19:18] <%Prevot> oh no

[1:19:45] <%BonewheelVanguard> NTR tag active
[1:19:47] <%Halospaz117> They must have lured his men in with the facade of vanilla handholding
[1:19:57] <Buttsoup_Barnes> Yeah I feel for them

[1:20:14] <%Halospaz117> "Oh look at these to young people in love. Wait why are there mongos? NOOOOOOO"

[1:20:30] <T_Sasquatch> To be fair he's right
[1:20:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Stupid sexy Ryuzo
[1:20:39] <Make_me_mad> Ryuzo is just salty that he wasn't a good enough rival.
[1:20:44] <Parapattern> They had a tournament arc
[1:20:52] <%MrAtheGreat> I am LORD GHOST

[1:22:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:59:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Toadette :(
[2:59:19] <ShinobiPhoenix> @cobalt_phoenix_ Woolie missed a lot of Nier Automata weirdness,
[2:59:28] <Monkeyweed21> @cobalt_phoenix_ there's alot of codex entries from androids talkin about being preggo
[2:59:39] <DatAsuna> well persona also has hundreds of demons
[2:59:43] <ShinobiPhoenix> I'm not sure Pokemon needs to be turned into Persona...
[2:59:47] <Aussie_Manny> Billy, get a haircut, ya hippie.
[2:59:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> "YET!" PogChamp
[2:59:52] <DatAsuna> so I guess in that context sure, many models
[3:00:01] <yeildingthought> Digimon is just better overall
[3:00:02] <@Menitta> Pokemon doesnt need to be persona. Pokemon needs to be better Pokemon.
[3:00:14] <ShinobiPhoenix> the Asian Hulk
[3:00:21] <DatAsuna> but also neither cyber sleuth or peron have like
[3:00:27] <DatAsuna> amazing animations on the demons
[3:00:30] <%jorniev> ITS HULK
[3:00:37] <+kekkerscrew> Bruce Banner
[3:00:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Bruce Banner
[3:00:40] <+kekkerscrew> It's still Bruce
[3:00:41] <Monkeyweed21> its the one where someone eats Hulk and he regenerates inside them
[3:00:43] <ShinobiPhoenix> Amadeus Cho is green too
[3:00:47] <+GuyNooN> hoolk
[3:01:02] <KaiserMario> Red Hulk is Thunderbolt Ross
[3:01:13] <kamesenpai> Yooooo its bigger me
[3:01:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Still Bruce Banner, but what if Gamma Radiation was eldritch devil energy ?
[3:01:20] <kamesenpai> whaddup woolz
[3:01:21] <@Menitta> ok but that's sick
[3:01:26] <ShinobiPhoenix> when did Bruce come back to life, last time I paid attention, Hawkeye shot him through the back
[3:01:29] <@Menitta> I also would wear that
[3:01:33] <+jiggy_snipe> in college lol

[3:01:59] <%doomerskeletor13> @shinobiphoenix Well that’s the whole premise of the Immortal Hulk series
[3:02:01] <RunoEddie> I'm still thinking about the thing about Street Fighter that Woolie aluded at the end of the last stream
[3:02:03] <BlackermanZX> did you scratch the headband logo
[3:02:09] <RunoEddie> Hope it gets public soon
[3:02:15] <%Livelinne> I wore AoT cloak in a music fes! It did saved me from pouring rain!
[3:02:15] <%stevo_scar> the jojo boxera
[3:02:18] <DatAsuna> you wear a dreamcast on your wrist
[3:02:18] <+GuyNooN> still remember the scanlations of sbr
[3:02:25] <%stevo_scar> jojo boxers
[3:02:33] <ShinobiPhoenix> yeah, Immortal Hulk is Amadeus Cho as the Hulk, so when did Bruce come back
[3:02:41] <Aussie_Manny> The Naruto headband you STILL wear in the shower tho.
[3:02:46] <%Livelinne> shiaCry

[3:03:45] <Monkeyweed21> 2018
[3:03:53] <+cvp5127> ancient
[3:03:57] <%doomerskeletor13> They both came out in 2018
[3:03:59] <ShinobiPhoenix> Totally Awesome Hulk is Cho but Immortal is just Bruce?
[3:04:06] <%RyTYoung> God feels like a lifetime ago
[3:04:07] <+GuyNooN> Dad of boy makes my heart smile, miss it...
[3:04:15] <%Irridium> *came out two years ago* "wow that old?!"
[3:04:17] <Aussie_Manny> Yeh, Pat was on controls and Matt was on commentary with Woolz.
[3:04:17] <DatAsuna> I think Reggie is confused because of pop off report
[3:04:25] <RunoEddie> it's almost 2021
[3:04:30] <%doomerskeletor13> @shinobiphoenix Yes. The premise of the series is about the Hulk being immortal. You have to read it to get the full picture
[3:04:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the original six pairs of eyes if i'm not mistaken
[3:04:46] <%Jetzord> Two years ago feels so long ago now that we're in Crisis Era
[3:04:59] <+wthemanjr> sup
[3:05:00] <DatAsuna> Arma .etc is the sim shit
[3:05:16] <ShinobiPhoenix> deaths in Comic books really are pointless, unless you're not popular
[3:05:21] <%Irridium> I mean it's been VERY heavily modified but yeah
[3:05:24] <%jorniev> those burger and fries ARE delicius
[3:05:26] <%doomerskeletor13> I’m really hoping the God of War sequel is coming soon after the PS5 launches
