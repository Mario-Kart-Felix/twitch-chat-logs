[0:16:55] <Rada150> griffin
[0:16:55] <ArtThouBored> Also Crimson Cloud is underappreciated
[0:16:57] <+Nomenanza> I still dont really like his theme
[0:16:58] <Rosy_Joan> his name is Chris Angel
[0:17:00] <Ninjagregory98> Did y’all see the new v gameplay?
[0:17:04] <MrGarettLefebvre> The latter realization that they are teh DMC bosses
[0:17:04] <Fenrirlives> BETTER SUBHUMAN
[0:17:07] <%Order_of_Mystery> and I hope that Dante acknowledges V's familiars! @WoolieVersus
[0:17:10] <Rada150> i thought phantom was a spider though
[0:17:10] <morow1ec> THAT HAT IS SO SICK
[0:17:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Look at Brokeback Dante!
[0:17:12] <$Superdandy96> What an awesome Goliath
[0:17:13] <%PlumpPotatoRump> i still wish V's had some oprah rock theme. some evanessense shit. But its ALL GOOD BBY
[0:17:14] <Thepothero> I really wanna play him woolie
[0:17:16] <+TopTieramisu> V is the true protagonist
[0:17:18] <konami2010> saviour
[0:17:22] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> GAY COWBOY YEAH
[0:17:22] <+Nomenanza> Though according to the composer, the mix is gonna be different in the game
[0:17:23] <rufus2k2> there he is, Unca Dante
[0:17:24] <+Sp3ctre48> Crimson Cloud is great
[0:17:25] <+MightyMaxT> Gay Cowboy Dante is true Dante
[0:17:26] <+EtheralFlameX> Did you see 4 and 2 got flipped in the timeline?
[0:17:26] <exploitativity2> devil trigger the best
[0:17:26] <kaine_west> v is great
[0:17:27] <Brosocrates> gay cowboy dante
[0:17:27] <buffmurffy> V's theme is goood for V
[0:17:29] <Rexenexus> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[0:17:30] <%topendbuzz> V
[0:17:31] <pluswplus> vs theme fits him really well
[0:17:33] <CerberusDriver> Subhuman 2.0 sounds great
[0:17:34] <nobknee> Did the game fully release?
[0:17:35] <+theottree> This version of Subhuman is good imo
[0:17:36] <Thepothero> And there’s gay cowboy
[0:17:37] <%shimmy825> This trailer sold me on Subhuman
[0:17:38] <@Squdnate> V's theme is super good!
[0:17:39] <+connos_livereview> yeah debil trigger is fuckn great
[0:17:39] <+owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> I AM AMANDA
[0:17:40] <%UrsulaCat> what's dmc
[0:17:40] <ArtThouBored> Oh fer sure
[0:17:40] <+JacktheMan18> Subhuman is fine with these new vocals tho
[0:17:40] <+Nomenanza> Yeah
[0:17:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> V is a Stickam user
[0:17:42] <zerocruz> I AM OMEGA apatDab apatWhat apatDab
[0:17:42] <BunnyMcFluff> Nero just gets the best songs
[0:17:42] <Bakefowl> I AM A MANGO
[0:17:43] <FatDragonQuest> So wait what bosses are the panther and big boy?
[0:17:45] <%topendbuzz> BANG BANG BANG
[0:17:45] <%BarryGibbz> V totally has a magic show in Vegas
[0:17:46] <+theottree> BANG BANG BANG is just too much tho
[0:17:46] <bathoi> its insane how good devil trigger is
[0:17:47] <kharboush98> the new subhuman isn't bad actually
[0:17:51] <+bthevboi> idk im a big fan of Vs theme
[0:17:53] <codmitz> anyone else notice V is pretty much the kid from Babel II?
[0:17:54] <%Order_of_Mystery> Devil Trigger is one of the best songs in video game history, bar fucking none
[0:17:55] <+TheGreatBamBe> Did Trish's cleavage just sparkle?
[0:17:56] <+Nomenanza> Devil Trigger IS dmc5's theme at this point
[0:17:56] <DirtyPopcornJ> I've been listening to Devil Trigger all damn day
[0:17:58] <+Kavtech> I will argue they are all equally good.
[0:18:00] <jonhenry97> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER!
[0:18:02] <+bthevboi> but devil trigger does get the excitement going
[0:18:03] <revzero25> V might be my main instead of Nero
[0:18:05] <EBT93> Man, I remember when Woolie said Devil Trigger wasn’t very DMC
[0:18:05] <ArtThouBored> Nero 1 V 2 and thats it
[0:18:06] <Fenrirlives> new subhuman is actually fun to listen to
[0:18:10] <edgeyberzerker> Devil Trigger was the type of music I listened to back in the 2000s
[0:18:15] <RvnWrtngdsk> Has he not seen Max's footage?
[0:18:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DEAD WEIGHT
[0:18:15] <pirateofpie> @codmitz Finally, someone else notices that lol
[0:18:18] <MrGarettLefebvre> Nightmare, Phantom, Griffin
[0:18:19] <buffmurffy> imagine if you could unlock full game multiplayer
[0:18:19] <+theottree> NERO GO
[0:18:22] <ArtThouBored> Dante has no theme Kappa
[0:18:23] <revzero25> is the new subhuman availble to listen to
[0:18:29] <Sphincter_Spelunker> The change to Trish's look makes Eva look like a witch in her photo on Dante's desk
[0:18:29] <CerberusDriver> Dante calling Nero dead weight is harsh
[0:18:30] <young_daisuke> nero is a bitch
[0:18:34] <Brosocrates> Delayed parental absue
[0:18:34] <prime_name> Digging V's playstyle.
[0:18:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus Yo you can do absolutely fucked broken shit with Gerbera
[0:18:37] <+YoohooYuzu> my boyfriend loves v's theme but i personally cant get into it myself
[0:18:37] <konami2010> multiplayer bloody palace when?
[0:18:37] <%PlagueOfGripes> at the end of the game you won't be able to see the skyline, for all the secret characters
[0:18:39] <+ItsAGundamu> GOD V IS SO FUCKING COOL
[0:18:42] <FatDragonQuest> really hope bloody palace is more like 3
[0:18:43] <+LogothX> just got an Apex legends ad
[0:18:44] <+FlubbedPig> You think you'll come to prefer any of the Breakers more than Nero's OG Devil Bringer?
[0:18:52] <BalloniWright> Nero > Dante
[0:18:53] <%UrsulaCat> leave it in and fall asleep together
[0:18:54] <+Nomenanza> Oh hey Eli
[0:18:58] <+Sprood> @WoolieVersus Are you interested at all in God Eater 3? It just released
[0:18:59] <Mangoesarentcats> Kreygasm
[0:19:00] <NeroCapone> V being a slow walking tank with the size of a malnourished emo teenager is so interestingly jarring LUL
[0:19:04] <chaozagents> Virgil: Son, I have come back from the cigarette store give me a hand
[0:19:07] <WanderingSwordsman> But the game will exceed your expectations
[0:19:07] <zerocruz> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:19:08] <+Rust_Wick> what's with capcom having power hungry guys like wesker and vergil kids? dante having one or chris having one makes more sense
[0:19:09] <GrandmasterBFunk> did you hear that apparently dmc4 happened after dmc2 now?
[0:19:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> you're bitching about Nero on the wrong stream to the wrong streamer, buddy
[0:19:17] <+Nomenanza> Vergil comes back with a carton of milk
[0:19:18] <+Rust_Wick> have kids*
[0:19:21] <$HentaiSenpai9K> GUN
[0:19:21] <%BarryGibbz> look at all those graphics
[0:19:23] <damiensiegfried> dddddddddevil may cry-ry-ry
[0:19:29] <+LogothX> G U N
[0:19:31] <%GohanEgret> g u n
[0:19:32] <MrGarettLefebvre> I want to see the Dante Porn trailer
[0:19:32] <%BarryGibbz> theres at least 15 graphics here
[0:19:36] <EBT93> I always put gun on L1
[0:19:36] <young_daisuke> nero was a waste of sperm
[0:19:37] <pluswplus> just claw it like a real man
[0:19:38] <FatDragonQuest> okay can we get itsuno to tell us what the timeline is because how did dante get out of hell in between 2 and 4
[0:19:40] <+HelloImTom08> Gun Go Up
[0:19:40] <zerocruz> RE engine is the fucking best
[0:19:44] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> Spoiler alert: you can't turn off the controller speaker bullshit in-game
[0:19:45] <buffmurffy> am i the only one who likes attack on square?
[0:19:47] <moustascheman> you don't need to do gun on the trigger anymore since they changed how charging works
[0:19:48] <%shimmy825> That's gonna be weird when you switch to Dante
[0:19:50] <Penatron> Devil Breaker on trigger is way more important imo
[0:19:50] <+JustToWatch> SUBTITLES
[0:19:52] <%topendbuzz> subtitles?
[0:19:53] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus You should try devil breaker on R2 to charge it too
[0:20:01] <+goose_attack_almanac> Apex Legends may be a bit of a let down (despite being good game on it's own). But I did manage to get about ten people to buy titanfall 2 because of it.
[0:20:03] <PlainSimpleTailor> GUN.exe has loaded
[0:20:07] <+abadbadman> whens apex legends
[0:20:11] <+UnderpaidBob> let that devil trigger rock
[0:20:19] <DraxTD> an I see @WoolieVersus got his DMC V to work
[0:20:31] <+MightyMaxT> Can you have two buttons be the same function?
[0:20:34] <Rexenexus> That's why I put Rev on R2 and gun on L2
[0:20:36] <+Nomenanza> I am more comfortable personally remapping L1 to gun and square to breaker burst @WoolieVersus Same thing I did in DMC4
[0:20:38] <+FlubbedPig> Could it maybe be a toggle/hold situation like Nier Automata was?
[0:20:44] <+MrMediocrity> I see that cheeky katamari
[0:20:44] <+Nomenanza> Much easier on the fingers
[0:20:46] <FatDragonQuest> I'm personally fine with gun being on square
[0:20:47] <+SuperSolidSnake64> its so weird with all the options that toggle lock on is not there
[0:20:50] <moustascheman> gun charging is different now
[0:20:50] <DNAITO> swap L1 and R1
[0:20:51] <TsunTsuchinoko> the Gun has created Need
[0:20:52] <%PlumpPotatoRump> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:20:53] <Caidezes> So Nero's gonna get an angel(o) themed devil trigger, right? Because he better. Those wings in the logo are way too suspicious.
[0:21:01] <+Rust_Wick> master exploder
[0:21:05] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Jump cancel feels GREAT
[0:21:06] <+Sprood> @WoolieVersus Is this a new demo?
[0:21:10] <@Moobot> No need to shout, @Nomenanza (warning)

[0:21:14] <+SuperSolidSnake64> Punch line is great dude
[0:21:14] <%shimmy825> Use claw grip. Arthritis aint all that bad

[0:32:25] <revzero25> second best taunt
[0:32:25] <Rosy_Joan> @woolieversus can you turn up the jams?
[0:32:26] <AncelDeLambert> I can't hear Devil Trigger, what the fuck sorcery is this?
[0:32:29] <gatorafan> So being able to see the enemies HP is a new thing for this right?
[0:32:31] <justcauseican4> you can rev the taunt to get 2 stocks instead of just one
[0:32:35] <GeneralHysterics> THUG 3

[0:32:43] <Youwereeatenbyalid> in regards to making sure he actually walks towards an enemy
[0:32:46] <mr_ESB> Revving feels way more lenient than 4
[0:32:47] <@mothmandraws> Is this the new tony hawks game?
[0:32:50] <+fizzguy47> how.to use punch line that way?
[0:32:51] <+countgaculatv> Is it just Nero that's playable again?

[0:33:33] <%DXLelouch24> wait, do I see up bars? huh this could be used to find optimal dps combos
[0:33:37] <Agami23> his slam dunk will be a different arm called buster
[0:33:38] <%jinking79> it's hard getting the hoodie on in fights
[0:33:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> OOOH

[0:33:41] <%DXLelouch24> HP*
[0:33:42] <gatorafan> Can Nero stop Bam Margera's World Destruction Tour?
[0:33:43] <AncelDeLambert> @Squdnate Capcom does good things, and Capcom does dumb things, but we love them despite it.

[0:33:55] <rufus2k2> See that? Nero isn't baseline human even without the arm
[0:33:56] <+JustToWatch> a best case scenario of London after a hard brexit

[0:34:13] <+Irridium> @Holycow8498 yeah it's the same apart from one added encounter, the upgrade shop, and an extra devil breaker

[0:35:10] <%PlagueOfGripes> aren't half demons in this universe just saiyans
[0:35:13] <GeneralHysterics> This is the real shit
[0:35:14] <BackwardCap> As wonky to control as a rocket fist could be.
[0:35:15] <gatorafan> Nero can Shin Shoryuken, Dante has Shinryuken
[0:35:16] <+anokaydude> I was thinking of playing the DMC games, should I skip DMC 2?
[0:35:19] <+CyrusBain> Wait, its out!?
[0:35:20] <joylent_blue> CEGold broken in that its much easier now
[0:35:21] <AncelDeLambert> @WoolieVersus music is, indeed, quiet

[0:36:33] <+FlubbedPig> Doesn't Overture seem kinda weak compared to the other two? Not in terms of damage but like, interest.
[0:36:35] <+lukeyp95> outside of tht i mean
[0:36:38] <%DXLelouch24> someone undistorted his voice

[0:37:10] <SpookySpaghooti> wait so does this demo have all 3 characters?
[0:37:10] <+TheMeta88> The Dante, Nero, Vergil family reunion is what we need in life.

[0:37:21] <+lukeyp95> we can assume it's vergil yes but that's not what i asked lol. i'm saying has he been properly revealed yet, but i'll take that as a no
[0:37:22] <%deadredeyez> VoteYea woolieCHAN VoteYea
[0:37:23] <justcauseican4> AAAAAAA

[0:37:25] <rufus2k2> that looks so cool on the rebound
[0:37:25] <%DXLelouch24> I best see a triple jackpot
[0:37:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:37:30] <nmaten> everything about this demo is the best
[0:37:34] <+Trotski7> Ninja Gaiden is a better action series
[0:37:34] <mr_ESB> Even with so much on screen the game feels smoooth
[0:37:34] <ECRead> huh... Apex Legends ad :)
[0:37:36] <%DXLelouch24> don't dissapear itsuno
[0:37:41] <EBT93> That’s not stylin’Kappa
[0:37:43] <ivansonic08> I love how woolie now stops himself from saying Let it Rock
[0:37:43] <+Th3SmartAlec> Pull up a chair as you style
[0:37:44] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @blairIntheUSA honestly an entire game that's just the bar area from DMC3 is exactly what I wanted
[0:37:44] <konami2010> you can do that off the horse though
[0:37:46] <+FlubbedPig> Wonder if you can ride the fist over to the rooftop
[0:37:47] <gatorafan> Enemy has learned: self preservation doodStare
[0:37:49] <Polengoldur> @ECRead Billy's playing it if you want to watch
[0:37:52] <%DXLelouch24> dissapoint* damn autocorrect
[0:37:56] <GeneralHysterics> Gerbera looks BUSTED
[0:38:03] <+CyrusBain> @WoolieVersus Is it exhaling all expectations so far? LUL
[0:38:07] <ECRead> Gerbera is so fucking cool
[0:38:08] <%fFailureatlife> has he let it out?
[0:38:13] <+CyrusBain> EXCEEDING*
[0:38:14] <revzero25> Well he does have the same clothes as Vergil and even holds yamato like him and its the same voice actor
[0:38:15] <+fizzguy47> can you do the boss flawless, woolz?
[0:38:15] <chromerazor> you can explode your arm during an air taunt to cancel into a second air taunt to go higher
[0:38:16] <+Bane_Kaikyo> does he hav unique taunts withot an arm attatched?
[0:38:20] <TehLankyGuy> Demo or game?
[0:38:21] <WanderingSwordsman> Gerbera is fantastic on Goliath
[0:38:23] <+abadbadman> have you done a Gerhera backwards mid combo, pure fucking sexual
[0:38:23] <ivansonic08> I didn't like Gerbera as much as everyone else unfortunately
[0:38:25] <bignerb> demo
[0:38:28] <ScreamingMeat> Devilbreakers add so much depth to Nero's gameplay. Way more than the Devilbringer did. If Nero get's his old arm back I hope they do something awesome with it
[0:38:34] <AlasterAngelo> gerbera is fine but punch line is best
[0:38:35] <ECRead> @Polengoldur i forgot he had a twitch too
[0:38:36] <gatorafan> @ffailureatlife, That's Woolie's secret, he always lets it out Kappa
[0:38:37] <HefestoForges> ex-seed of agnus
[0:38:37] <+Th3SmartAlec> Actually the healers would help with getting more style when you think about it
[0:38:39] <jase__x> WOOOLZ
[0:38:39] <+PleasantLee> Hey Woolie, Overture, Punch Line or Gerbera...but in real life, choose 1
[0:38:41] <AlasterAngelo> overture is baller too if you're willing to spend it
[0:38:42] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @TehLankyGuy if it was the game, pat would be here
[0:38:42] <AncelDeLambert> instant C rank
[0:38:43] <%DXLelouch24> his old arms confirmed
[0:38:43] <357Sneak> lytTHUMBSUP
[0:38:47] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @rufus2k2
[0:38:49] <joylent_blue> Bane_Kaikyo no, and some of his taunts are super goofy without the arm LUL
[0:38:50] <+Nomenanza> I wish we could change difficulty in this to a higher one
[0:38:54] <KaironFortressKnight> Nero's sword should be like fans expectations. EXCEEDED
[0:38:57] <rufus2k2> oop
[0:38:57] <+Nomenanza> I so wanted to smack more enemies
[0:38:58] <%DXLelouch24> someone at Capcom leaked devil bringer
[0:38:58] <AncelDeLambert> uuuurgh, don't put it in your POCKET
[0:38:59] <VirtualMode> secret room
[0:39:00] <%shimmy825> Air taunt is great for getting to lvl2 exceed during a fight
[0:39:01] <%DXLelouch24> lol
[0:39:01] <foreverN2dust> where did he put it?
[0:39:02] <GeneralHysterics> Yeah, put that gross tick thing in your POCKEY
[0:39:03] <mayorrev> koopy
[0:39:05] <FatDragonQuest> Nero stop putting that in your pockets
[0:39:10] <ScreamingMeat> WutFace
[0:39:11] <Rosy_Joan> get the koopy fruit
[0:39:12] <@Solidus_113> it's super obvious this demo is on Easy/Human difficulty
[0:39:15] <buffmurffy> isnt it faster to time exceed as opposed to mash it?
[0:39:17] <alwayspronking> LUL
[0:39:17] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie's pockeettttsssssssss are goopy now
[0:39:18] <revzero25> pat doesnt have anything on woolie when it comes to dmc
[0:39:18] <ZeeJiggle> @woolieversus I noticed that if you let go og your gun charge during some actions, like the air taunt, you can keep all 3 charges without holding the button.
[0:39:20] <bsmusic> LUL LUL
[0:39:21] <ZaibatsuFan> @rufus2k2 These moobots will be the death of me

[0:39:31] <ScreamingMeat> @WoolieVersus Devilbreakers add so much depth to Nero's gameplay. Way more than the Devilbringer did. If Nero get's his old arm back I hope they do something awesome with it
[0:39:31] <+Griffin1171> never let Itsuno forget
[0:39:31] <EBT93> LUL
[0:39:32] <alwayspronking> WRITE THAT DOWN

[0:40:40] <nmaten> music so quiet
[0:40:40] <gatorafan> Journalists are leaking the game for us this time Kappa
[0:40:41] <357Sneak> SourPls
[0:40:42] <reonome> IT SLAPS
[0:40:42] <revzero25> no spoilers please

[0:40:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie pls
[0:40:45] <%DXLelouch24> I doubt Urizen is Vergil, I saw a clip and he doesn't fight like him
[0:40:45] <mayorrev> SLAPS
[0:40:45] <Caivyre> MY WIFE <3
[0:40:45] <bsmusic> WutFace
[0:40:46] <%fFailureatlife> so later in the game it's revealed that Dante is the same Dante from Dantes inferno Kappa
[0:40:46] <EBT93> Way better than the Vergil mobile
[0:40:46] <+Taisuru> "The Kids" you mean pat?
[0:40:47] <+FlubbedPig> The kids do NOT say that
[0:40:47] <Prevot> Kreygasm
[0:40:47] <+vaporousTippler> apatDab
[0:40:47] <Rosy_Joan> turn up the jame Woolie!
[0:40:48] <+countgaculatv> Mmmmm the seed of Agnus lookin good

[0:40:49] <Laecerelius> SLAPPERS!
[0:40:50] <The_Lady_Alustriel> I thought the kids also said banger
[0:40:50] <AncelDeLambert> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:40:50] <SpookySpaghooti> I prefer 4's menu theme honestly but this is good
[0:40:51] <+mcjimbo12> the story of this game is basically going to boil down to like 3 hype reveals and some cool cutscene moments and that's all it needs to be
[0:40:51] <+MightyMaxT> This song slaps but this song also FUCKS
[0:40:52] <%DXLelouch24> also Urizen is huge
[0:40:52] <+Dovakhin573> reminds of ff15
[0:40:53] <bearwagon> Old Man Woolie
[0:40:53] <kDemented> @woolieversus did you watch Max's video ?
[0:40:55] <Caidezes> S L A P S

[0:40:56] <+EU_is_Garbage> slaps harder than my mom after 2 glasses of wine
[0:40:56] <Laecerelius> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:40:57] <+bthevboi> chill beats so study too
[0:40:58] <@Squdnate> Have you seen how they've retconned DMC2's place in the timeline?
[0:40:58] <+digitaljeff> OH NO WOOLIE IS OLD NOW
[0:40:58] <+abadbadman> she has the perfect "Quiet day in retail" stance :D
[0:40:59] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Millions of Nico lewds incoming
[0:40:59] <alwayspronking> @WoolieVersus How much to make her van music the Fortuna Entertainment lounge music?
[0:41:00] <+applefibs> its a bop
[0:41:01] <%PlagueOfGripes> "slaps" is an embarassing slang term that will be soon abandoned
[0:41:04] <+swaggopotamus> YO this shop screen.
[0:41:04] <+Taisuru> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:41:05] <nmaten> its a bop
[0:41:05] <ECRead> it's funky fresh
[0:41:06] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus have you looked at replica nero jackets coming about? I was able to snag a replica for 137$.
[0:41:07] <%shimmy825> FF15 vibes yeah
[0:41:07] <%CEGold> I REFUSE to acknowledge that Agnus had sex
[0:41:08] <+swaggopotamus> Capcom spoiling us.
[0:41:08] <GeneralHysterics> Agnus must have gotten some GRADE A TAIL for Nico to look like that
[0:41:08] <nekodelic> FFXV music absolutely
[0:41:09] <foreverN2dust> I'd slap her tummy
[0:41:10] <Cthulos> You mean prospectors from the 1880's say something slaps?
[0:41:11] <+LastHazzerd> bahhhhh buh bah bah badah
[0:41:11] <PEShDotEXE> Nico's my new 3D crush, look at that babe
[0:41:11] <Worldbrand> I fucking love town BGM
[0:41:13] <ScreamingMeat> Woolie hates Nico because she doesn't have short hair
[0:41:13] <JamvaanPS4> It's the shop music to end all shop music
[0:41:14] <Niney_Who> Plague stop being wrong
[0:41:15] <%fFailureatlife> this song totally slaps
[0:41:16] <Knight_578> i hope we get a new divinity statue theme
[0:41:21] <+CyrusBain> @WoolieVersus It has that 'coffee house' feeling.
[0:41:21] <Rayorin> We wouldn't know which music Woolie. You have the volume on the music so low we can't hear it
[0:41:22] <+countgaculatv> She looks like those second pump regret type girl; crazy and spiteful after.
[0:41:24] <nox_nyctores> Urizen is like 10 meters tall, if he's Vergil then I want his gym routine
[0:41:25] <+digitaljeff> Nico is my Trashfu
[0:41:26] <ryuguitarfreak> So
[0:41:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Remember the nighttime city music in Xenoblade Chronicles X
[0:41:28] <vingadivo> more like SLAP that tummy
[0:41:29] <ivansonic08> Its a convination of some southern old timey tune, but the subtle Bass and electric instruments add such depth
[0:41:32] <jorgeniev> i cant quite hear it
[0:41:35] <SpookySpaghooti> $137 holy shit
[0:41:35] <+Th3SmartAlec> @countgaculatv ...what?
[0:41:40] <fabnanman> dayum
[0:41:40] <$GoogleyGareth> WHERE?!
[0:41:42] <%Ryuartyi_> Nice
[0:41:42] <AncelDeLambert> 137 is pretty decent

[0:41:46] <JoeyStar> BANGER🔥ALERT🔥
[0:41:46] <ryuguitarfreak> How 10/10 is Punch Line?
[0:41:46] <GameXful2> its 8000 FUCKING BUCKS ??
[0:41:46] <SeshohoCian> Assertion: the devil breakers both mechanically and story-wise represent the experience of living with a prosthetic limb than MGS V, a game literally named "The Phantom Pain"
[0:41:49] <ScreamingMeat> Fuck that
[0:41:51] <3xgilly> thats amazinf
[0:41:51] <bignerb> dayyyymmm
[0:41:52] <SpookySpaghooti> 8,000 is fucking crazy
[0:41:52] <EBT93> That’s pretty good
[0:41:55] <AncelDeLambert> Capcom STOOOP
[0:41:55] <%RioGascar> from hollywood jackets for those asking
[0:41:58] <FatDragonQuest> I wish there were official dmc shirts
[0:41:58] <revzero25> where i want that jacket
[0:41:59] <SeshohoCian> *better than
[0:42:00] <%RioGascar> its NOT top tier
[0:42:05] <kresnikhama> at least Dante's is leather, but how TF is nero's that much???
[0:42:05] <+abadbadman> Woolie not a true Nero fan smh
[0:42:05] <Sphincter_Spelunker> No, support the game
[0:42:07] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus You think you'll come to prefer any of the Breakers more than Nero's OG Devil Bringer?
[0:42:08] <%RioGascar> but its able to work as a real jacket
[0:42:13] <+Griffin1171> The jacket's arm, I mean
[0:42:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie fake fan Kappa
[0:42:17] <Worldbrand> yeah but do they smell like him?
[0:42:17] <+PleasantLee> DMC4 Nero coat > DMC5 Nero coat
[0:42:23] <nmaten> yeah but how much for dante's red leather pants from dmc 1
[0:42:24] <AncelDeLambert> Stop questioning thing, just consume product and wait for next product
[0:42:28] <%RioGascar> also...i have been doing neros taunts in mirrors. its fun.
[0:42:29] <+MrMediocrity> You are the sould of tbfp
[0:42:30] <MTLxSpider> i thought you would say MTLxSpider
[0:42:32] <%Order_of_Mystery> there is literally a dude on ebay who sells nero's coat for $100
[0:42:32] <%BlitzChocula> I swear there's a V version with his rag of a vest going for a hefty price too lmao
[0:42:33] <MTLxSpider> senpai
[0:42:34] <joylent_blue> just do it quick
[0:42:35] <keiji_maede> Will capcom become CAPGOD after this game?
[0:42:36] <+cvp5127> its hard
[0:42:36] <+MrMediocrity> soul*
[0:42:36] <+RadDuuude> just played the demo :)
[0:42:37] <gatorafan> This new Capcom with budget seems to assume everyone nowadays has budget as well. moon2E
[0:42:39] <Oqzar> its easy
[0:42:40] <+Th3SmartAlec> flick back, flick forward, hit
[0:42:40] <@Moobot> Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @NinjaWitaSniper (warning)
[0:42:41] <Oqzar> just do it
[0:42:41] <%DXLelouch24> I mean Flubbed, we Know he gets Bringer back
[0:42:41] <joylent_blue> back and forth fast
[0:42:42] <+theottree> Just make sure you're doing the input right
[0:42:43] <+countgaculatv> Just do it 4head
[0:42:46] <EBT93> Just do it
[0:42:47] <%DXLelouch24> so it's fine
[0:42:50] <revzero25> you gotta do it fast
[0:42:59] <%GarbageNirvana> I don't think Capcom will reach Capgod status again until they fix Street Fighter
[0:43:01] <barnettboy55> Fun Fact: If Goliath knocks down the bell tower, the bell will still ring when it moves.
[0:43:02] <Rigenstein> this game out already?
[0:43:02] <EBT93> Shuffle
[0:43:02] <+Nomenanza> Calibur is much easier to execute in this game in my opinion
[0:43:03] <+Dovakhin573> is weird that i have issues doing calibur while i can do the same motion in bayo easier
[0:43:13] <+Nomenanza> Also I have using it so much more than compared to 4
[0:43:17] <GeneralHysterics> Ah yes, I speak controller.
[0:43:21] <GameXful2> yeah I can't seem to do it too
[0:43:21] <konami2010> move the controller, not your thumb
[0:43:25] <GeneralHysterics> I understand it's clicks perfectly
[0:43:28] <FatDragonQuest> This is gonna come off as scrubby but I never really used calibur
[0:43:34] <ScreamingMeat> @WoolieVersus With all these awesome robot arms Nero's old Devilbringer has a lot to live up too if he gets it back
[0:43:37] <+countgaculatv> The language of my people. Inputs through a mic.
[0:43:40] <revzero25> shuffle is better
[0:43:40] <joylent_blue> Calibur is a godsend against bosses
[0:43:42] <FatDragonQuest> air calibur is good though
[0:43:43] <%UrsulaCat> I had to go do dishes what did I miss
[0:43:47] <nox_nyctores> SourPls
[0:43:48] <@mothmandraws> you need to emotionally connect with the controler
[0:43:48] <+Th3SmartAlec> @FatDragonQuest I feel it's more useful now that Nero's flying all over the place
[0:43:49] <ZeeJiggle> @woolieversus Noticed if you let go of your gun charge during certain actions, like the air taunt, you can keep all 3 charges without holding it down
[0:43:51] <%CEGold> Random question: Is Woolie playing RE2 tomorrow or was that a fever dream I had?
[0:43:51] <+Griffin1171> it's never consistent for me
[0:43:51] <EBT93> @fatdragonquest Calibur is very good for JCs
[0:43:52] <+frodog5050> i miss dmc
[0:43:58] <GeneralHysterics> Air calibur is A+, but never found a use for grounded calibur
[0:44:02] <ivansonic08> @joylent_blue TRUTH
[0:44:02] <FatDragonQuest> oh wait no I was mixing them up I meant shuffle
[0:44:03] <rufus2k2> @ScreamingMeat well just think, all the enemies including bosses will have unique grabs to them
[0:44:04] <Cthulos> Kreygasm She's got the lines and everythin
[0:44:05] <%NumberTooBig> is there a new demo out PogChamp

[1:01:38] <OneBadassNicka> Nero
[1:01:38] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus Would you rather play DMC2 fully again or Deadly Premonition fully?
[1:01:39] <ZaibatsuFan> Man, 2008 had some SHITTY games.
[1:01:40] <lozscat> Biggest Backdown
[1:01:40] <+Th3SmartAlec> @WoolieVersus Actually relevant question, did you here DMC2 now takes place before DMC4?
[1:01:41] <+Tarantulawl> Woolie is just trying to scare off new DMC 2 fans so he can have it all to himself
[1:01:41] <nmaten> oh shit
[1:01:45] <+cvp5127> the former
[1:01:45] <+Rust_Wick> playable trish was fun @WoolieVersus that's about it for me
[1:01:47] <OneBadassNicka> Vergil easily
[1:01:47] <Swish19XX> Twin Snakes!
[1:01:49] <MSN04_Sazabi> Nero
[1:01:49] <%UrsulaCat> Woolie spat in my face and I thanked him
[1:01:52] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus excited to try this demo tomorrow. I played it early with Australian account...but uh...my ps4 hard drive was malfunctioning and boy glitchs happened (audio skips, save corruptions, random freezes) but new ssd for ps4 should arrive tomorrow.

[1:02:10] <Ninjagregory98> If you stream mgs3 get bunny hop on
[1:02:11] <+PleasantLee> Woolie have you seen the potential Mortal Kombat 11 roster leaks? Kotal Kahn is probably coming back

[1:02:27] <SpookySpaghooti> Daddy vs Son is gonna be so fucking cool
[1:02:27] <%PlumpPotatoRump> Virgil: Scum. Niro: Scum!
[1:02:29] <+TheMeta88> I feel like Vergil would destroy Nero.
[1:02:30] <JoeyStar> upload this rant to your channel and call it Devil May Cry 2 full playthrough
[1:02:32] <weissguard> I DIDN'T ASK TO BE JUDGEMENT NUTTED INTO EXISTENCE DAD! - Nero, DMCV
[1:02:36] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Daddy no
[1:02:37] <+SashaStarshine> Pat-ricide huh?
[1:02:38] <+TopTieramisu> PATricide
[1:02:38] <BigNerdSam> Nero would probably love Sweet Surrender
[1:02:39] <+MegaByteNumbers> local swordsman defeated by hitachi magic wand
[1:02:40] <ivansonic08> The proble is while Dante plays with Nero VErgil would just straight up KILL him
[1:02:43] <EBT93> I mean, Vergil was Mundus’ bitchboy for a while.

[1:08:12] <stranger59> Hell's school system is underfunded.

[1:08:14] <%UrsulaCat> I'll hold you to stealing that phrase
[1:08:14] <+Griffin1171> You landed on Goliath's square, That'll send him back!
[1:08:14] <+Th3SmartAlec> Oh god, a Zodd boss fight in DMC
[1:08:16] <joylent_blue> Personified134 new breaker arm, new enemy encounter, shop menu
[1:08:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus you can literally keep them airborne indefinitely by repeatedly gerera-ing them
[1:08:16] <ravencloak13> @screamingmeat Say that to his face and not as Nero, Dante or V.
[1:08:19] <bsmusic> @plagueofgripes maybe that's what demons lack. intelligence
[1:08:19] <ebonifragaria> *dumb enough
[1:08:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> member Wyald?
[1:08:24] <drefizz> GOLIATH Go Goliath Go Goliath Go Goliath
[1:08:25] <KaironFortressKnight> Berial was the least dumb first boss
[1:08:27] <+Nomenanza> Yeah, basically every first boss is just a big dumb demon who has the voice of a dude doing a generic big demon impression
[1:08:31] <AncelDeLambert> Like, the demons being basically Greek Gods, arrogance and all is necessary
[1:08:34] <Rngiddion> well this guy is clearly the jobber of the greater demon community
[1:08:38] <%shimmy825> Does gerbera have iframes?
[1:08:41] <%TheDr0t> woolieGASM
[1:08:41] <+Personified134> am I the only one who didn't like the GO GO BROLY stuff

[1:08:43] <+Griffin1171> trying to forget Wyalkd
[1:08:44] <vingadivo> already doing way better than pat
[1:08:48] <%TheMilhouseExperience> He’s more dmc3 Beowulf than Zodd.
[1:08:49] <%Agent_For_Hire> Nosferatu Zodd gets around it by just not talking
[1:08:50] <Cthulos> Could it be cause they're underestimating this PUNY HOOMAN? @plagueofgripes
[1:09:02] <drefizz> @Personified134 it was cheesy fun
[1:09:02] <SpookySpaghooti> @Personified134 it was kinda dumb but I liked it for exactly that reason
[1:09:04] <%ZaibatsuFan> What about Izalith demons?
[1:09:05] <GameXful2> Punchline absolutely melts Goliath
[1:09:06] <+Thorn14> A MERE HUMAN
[1:09:06] <smallboops> cause you have to establish the Anime Law of "small humanoids are infinitely stronger"
[1:09:10] <+theottree> One thing that's really noteworthy about this fight is all its setpiece transitions that don't have cutscenes or strict timings @WoolieVersus
[1:09:11] <+abadbadman> i was really missing combo 2 in this demo
[1:09:15] <revzero25> CRASH
[1:09:16] <zerocruz> Use the air taunt tech
[1:09:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Agent_For_Hire And his only goal in life is to get motivated in a fight
[1:09:20] <ravencloak13> @anceldelambert I mean, only Ares was ever really bested by mortals since he was actually stupid do to his aspect of being the worse aspects of war and warriors
[1:09:20] <+PleasantLee> Reflect a fire ball or you are trash!!!!!!
[1:09:29] <DrkJP520> I uppercutted this bastard the first time I fought him. Almost came in my pants.
[1:09:32] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Personified134 Nope. Lyrics were distracting at best
[1:09:37] <+fizzguy47> do you have i-frames on dodge?
[1:09:37] <+Thorn14> oh i had no idea you could just walk outside LUL

[1:17:20] <Hyphixsys> @Max_Kaiser All I want from Capcom is Dragon's Dogma 2, unfortunately, they made that MMO instead LUL
[1:17:21] <Soman97> @woolieversus you can get that Rorb fatty in the very beginning if you send out punch line at him
[1:17:21] <smallboops> THE MUSIC

[1:17:25] <+fizzguy47> man, this is some deep shit to lesrn
[1:17:35] <thepiefoot> It just came to mind, has anyone tried JC shuffle? That was the coolest shit back in DMC4
[1:17:37] <+SpaciousWheat> Not really
[1:17:40] <%FloppytoKey> now THIS is a video game
[1:17:43] <%TechTurtle7> octoNut1
[1:17:43] <+SpaciousWheat> DNC
[1:17:49] <+Bustamente> Gerbera is best arm
[1:17:51] <brainfromarous> Which Zelda is this...?
[1:17:52] <%Uulyaoth> Have they said anything more about how the co op works yet?
[1:17:52] <DrkJP520> You'll rev up the sword faster if you hold the button for like a second at a time. Can lvl it up on the 3rd rev.
[1:17:54] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Try to jump cancel with enemy step man, its super easy now
[1:17:55] <+BlueBardTiefling> Not sure it's been said, but you can deflect Goliath's fireball
[1:17:57] <+ZeroMP_> Gerbera best girl
[1:17:57] <Kalcom> can't even beat pat smh
[1:17:58] <Penatron> @thepiefoot Yeah, it's way easier now too
[1:18:03] <GeneralHysterics> now THIS is podracing
[1:18:05] <%ZaibatsuFan> Woolie you are so coooooool
[1:18:06] <AlasterAngelo> PUNCHLINE BEST HANDFU
[1:18:06] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus Does the upgrades in this demo only go up to where the Xbox one was?
[1:18:07] <GameXful2> PUNCHLINE BEST GIRL
[1:18:09] <C_Sixty_Jam> Move fast baby don't be slow~~~~
[1:18:10] <danknugglit> Games like this really stand out amidst todays 40 pubg and fortnite clones
[1:18:10] <@Menitta> Do*
[1:18:12] <Hyphixsys> @GeneralHysterics Kappa
[1:18:13] <gravitydazequeen> How do you keep the charged shots?
[1:18:14] <Ordinaryknight> @fizzguy47 i mean overture my bad
[1:18:16] <rufus2k2> @Hyphixsys they recently said that Itsuno opted to make DMC5 first instead of DD2
[1:18:17] <gunzerkingdunce> @mr_miyagichu dude, comboing the arms is sick. Put an Overture bomb then Charge punchline for fireworks
[1:18:19] <+SirG005E> whats that red belt looking thing that nero uses to pull enemies towards him
[1:18:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can spam the gerbera launch and enemy step it, and you can rocket yourself up into the air with them
[1:18:21] <+fizzguy47> i hope he still has his triple suplex in the full game
[1:18:25] <C_Sixty_Jam> @gravitydazequeen Hold down the shoot button
[1:18:25] <Dral54> You gotta shoot in sync with the "bang bang bang" too
[1:18:25] <+Th3SmartAlec> I can't wait for higher difficulties where the fight lasts more than 30 seconds
[1:18:26] <%Max_Kaiser> @Hyphixsys apparnetly there's a recent interview where itsuno said he went to the CEO and he said he could make either DMC5 or Dragon's Dogma 2 and Itsuno wanted to do DMC 5 first, but stronglt hinted that DD2 would be next
[1:18:27] <thepiefoot> @Penatron Naissu, i've seen calibur JC. But Shuffle JC into Calibur is the hypest shit to me
[1:18:30] <joylent_blue> Menitta for the most part yes, but you get enemy step and shuffle
[1:18:30] <zafooru> DMC battle royale WhEN
[1:18:31] <spacecatstreams> what is that face in the top right corner?
[1:18:36] <seylumiue> Woolz use punchline DRI in the air
[1:18:38] <konami2010> you can air hike and taunt to get to the top of that bridge
[1:18:39] <+Nomenanza> @gravitydazequeen it releases the first shot automatically then keeps the next 2 for your next shots
[1:18:47] <Hyphixsys> @rufus2k2 OOMF.....I guess we'll have to wait like 4-5 more years for Dragon's Dogma 2
[1:18:50] <@Menitta> @joylent_blue Ah nice

[1:24:40] <pluswplus> enemy step is great against this guy
[1:24:42] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus Did you ever beat Hellblade or nah? I never got around to that game.
[1:24:46] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus use enemy step
[1:24:49] <Oqzar> @tungstenviper charge shot 3 is just overture exploder
[1:24:51] <bignerb> @SpiritLegion he does
[1:24:53] <rufus2k2> @Trtickster no, that's quite new, pretty much Nico's mobile lab
[1:24:55] <+dodge_and_dust> it would be cool if you could fall through here early by using real impact on him
[1:24:59] <CerberusDriver> @Trtickster no, Nero runs his own DMC shop out of that van. Dante has his own building.
[1:25:00] <+VietcongSamurai> @Ordinaryknight Ah okay, that's cool. Was hoping it would be like old nero's grab moves.
[1:25:01] <+TheImmortal70> You know one thing I kinda wish they implemented?
[1:25:04] <+TheImmortal70> Gun combos
[1:25:04] <%Order_of_Mystery> i know it'll be good, but man I want metroid 4 like fucking now
[1:25:12] <danknugglit> The camera is great
[1:25:14] <oJxn> How do you switch arms? I couldnt figure it out
[1:25:17] <AlasterAngelo> STOP BUZZING AROUND
[1:25:20] <+jyeowa> SMOrc STOP BUZZING AROUND
[1:25:21] <%jermulr> i wondered why enemy step was 15000 blorbs. because. its SUPER useful
[1:25:24] <+imextremelymanly> I'm so curious about the co-op in this game is there going to be a dedicated arena or is it going to be like RE 6 where you drop in and out
[1:25:32] <Ordinaryknight> @vietcongsamurai there is an arm that does that, it hasnt been in any of the demos yet
[1:25:36] <%QueequegTheater> >15000 BLORBS
[1:25:36] <+TheImmortal70> Enemy step acts as the basis for all the sick combos you see
[1:25:38] <PranaPulse> !uptime
[1:25:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 25 minutes
[1:25:41] <+Thorn14> its going to be liek RE6
[1:25:41] <joylent_blue> oJxn L1 to manually break an arm, you can't switch between them without breaking one
[1:25:41] <gunzerkingdunce> What I do is hoard 3 Overtures and plant all 3 during first phase, literally blow through it
[1:25:44] <+TheImmortal70> So of course it's 15000 Rorbs
[1:25:44] <+Thorn14> there's Co op levels
[1:25:49] <+Thorn14> where people can jump in and out
[1:25:50] <+Irridium> if you shoot him with charged shots when he's jumping like that he gets hit-stunned in the air and it looks hilarious
[1:25:52] <GeneralHysterics> Thank you moobot
[1:25:52] <vingadivo> mount him woolie
[1:25:53] <+imextremelymanly> spin him around like bowser
[1:25:55] <+VietcongSamurai> @Ordinaryknight Now I'm motivated.
[1:26:02] <+Thorn14> I dont think you can grapple him in the demo
[1:26:05] <+Thorn14> I think you need Buster Arm
[1:26:10] <tungstenviper> @Oqzar they remade Blue Rose. Overture bomb is another thing completely
[1:26:15] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUCKY
[1:26:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> wait, how do you grapple bosses in 5?
[1:26:18] <Kalcom> you can grab the cars
[1:26:20] <GeneralHysterics> Seed of sparta could all conceivably spin this guy around like mario...
[1:26:23] <+Griffin1171> So long, gay bowser
[1:26:23] <Kalcom> I htink
[1:26:24] <CerberusDriver> No, you need the mechanical devil bringer to toss him
[1:26:28] <vingadivo> that was close
[1:26:30] <joylent_blue> Order_of_Mystery theres gonna be an arm that can grapple enemies
[1:26:31] <+Thorn14> Buster Arm I think Mystery, it looks like the Grapple arm
[1:26:34] <NoirePanzer> SSS or riot
[1:26:34] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:26:36] <%jermulr> funny you mention dmc 2 because this boss reminds me of the orangutan boss in the train station.
[1:26:42] <+Th3SmartAlec> BAAAAAM
[1:26:46] <joylent_blue> LUL
[1:26:48] <+TheImmortal70> REAL IMPACT?!
[1:26:49] <+NoxAlchemist> how many times has woolie run through the demo
[1:26:50] <%Order_of_Mystery> @joylent_blue oh nice!
[1:26:52] <bignerb> the slow mo is great
[1:26:53] <+jyeowa> @WoolieVersus do you sense more depth in regards to gameplay from this boss than from berial?
[1:26:53] <Midnight_Crest> @woolieversus u should take the time to learn the exceed timings this session coz its really rewarding when u can do it consistently
[1:26:54] <GeneralHysterics> THE REALEST IMPACT
[1:26:54] <+imextremelymanly> would have been cool
[1:26:55] <tungstenviper> @Oqzar Also, maybe Blue Rose's explosion might be an upgrade
[1:26:58] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Use enemy step against Goliath
[1:26:58] <DrkJP520> Don't mash the exceed button out of combat. Hold it for 1 second at a time. You'll lvl the sword up in 3 presses.
[1:27:00] <joylent_blue> KISS THIS-- Rising DRAGON!
[1:27:02] <+TheImmortal70> NERO HAS A REAL IMPACT NOW PogChamp
[1:27:03] <samiscoolbro> Dmc 5 seikro and metro all within a month rip my wallet
[1:27:04] <oJxn> Did Woolie see that they changed the order of 2 and 4?
[1:27:04] <%ZaibatsuFan> Split it WIDE OPEN
[1:27:10] <+dodge_and_dust> it's even better if you get an ex high time
[1:27:13] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> hey uh im just now droppping in, but this looks like the first demo?
[1:27:14] <danknugglit> So fucking good
[1:27:14] <%Order_of_Mystery> @WoolieVersus punchline then gerbera!
[1:27:18] <%TheMilhouseExperience> A rank
[1:27:26] <+CommanderSqueaks> I'm sorry I blinked, the run is already over?
[1:27:27] <Oqzar> @tungstenviper I doubt it.... exploder is very similar to charge shot 3 with the launch
[1:27:28] <357Sneak> lytFIRSTTRY
[1:27:29] <+Th3SmartAlec> It occured to me the playtime for the demo might be comarable to the time people will spend playing the game itself
[1:27:30] <%QueequegTheater> Buddy pretty sure the first boss ain't taking on Definitely-Not-Vergil
[1:27:30] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus try using enemy step to jump cancel, its easy now
[1:27:33] <+dodge_and_dust> @HalfDecent_Gaming same but with some different encoutner, a new arm and that shop
[1:27:34] <joylent_blue> HalfDecent_Gaming its the same mission, but with a new breaker arm, and a new enemy encounter
[1:27:36] <CwutGaming> shotoBoi shotoBoi shotoBoi
[1:27:37] <PranaPulse> overture parries??
[1:27:40] <joylent_blue> HalfDecent_Gaming and a shop menu
[1:27:42] <+fizzguy47> So, hold Circle for fhe Shoryuken?
[1:27:42] <vingadivo> getting S eank seems really hard
[1:27:42] <AlasterAngelo> GET THAT S WOOLIE
[1:27:43] <extradopeness> Holy shit THAT RANK SCREEN
[1:27:47] <Oqzar> and sweet surrender might be compensation for him not having healing from DT @tungstenviper
[1:27:47] <%topendbuzz> that is not a s woolie
[1:27:47] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You need 5500 for s rank
[1:27:49] <+ssulcer> @WoolieVersus NOT WET
[1:27:49] <+Ryallen> So has anything changed since the last demo?
[1:27:49] <lozscat> No arm run?
[1:27:50] <Ordinaryknight> @order_of_mystery One of neros arms is his old devil bringer (or at least does throws).
[1:27:51] <%QueequegTheater> Time time time
[1:28:03] <vingadivo> world record pace
[1:28:04] <ebonifragaria> Rorbs!
[1:28:08] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus A little off the DMC topic, but have you seen the patch notes for BBTag? Akihiko got buffed pretty hard.
[1:28:09] <tungstenviper> @Oqzar SPOILER
[1:28:11] <ElenaManetta> you're not dry right now
[1:28:12] <SpiritLegion> MMMMMMMMMOTHERRR
[1:28:12] <+imextremelymanly> dry all day baby
[1:28:12] <%ZaibatsuFan> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie, if the only other character action game I've played is Metal Gear Rising, what should I be aware of coming into this game?

[1:28:17] <WanderingSwordsman> Need at least one S rank in one of those 3 areas
[1:28:20] <%QueequegTheater> TRIPLE A
[1:28:22] <+Birdigalore> Woolie Stay Dry 5
[1:28:24] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Ordinaryknight He better have special throws for every enemy, and one of them better be a suplex!
[1:28:26] <+bonzosan> get wet is such a strange bonus
[1:28:32] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> OHHH thanks guys lmao Im totally still gonna pop into this demo even if its similar Im way tooo hyped for this game
[1:28:39] <@Menitta> Its different

[1:29:05] <oJxn> Play 3 and 4
[1:29:05] <valriot> Hey @woolieversus Does it seem like they fixed the "orb" requirement for this game, aka i dont have to walk around grabbing orbs everytime i wanna do a stage
[1:29:06] <%TheDr0t> whats zaibatsu?
[1:29:08] <Midnight_Crest> Jump cancelling also gives u points
[1:29:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just thought my internet died again
[1:29:14] <bleugh> just, like, play the game
[1:29:14] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You can get all A and still get an S. It’s tricky though.
[1:29:15] <+Griffin1171> get the anime
[1:29:16] <Fisk_Black_PSN> If you've never played Devil May Cry, STAY AWAY FROM DMC
[1:29:17] <joylent_blue> watch the LPs with pat and woolie if you haven't
[1:29:18] <GeneralHysterics> zaibatsu is dead :(
[1:29:22] <+Ryan1016> Get the HD collection and 4 SE
[1:29:26] <%FloppytoKey> buy all of them, Itsuno needs the money
[1:29:27] <%Lion_kun> the true fans play all 4 games, 2 included
[1:29:27] <Ordinaryknight> @order_of_mystery Oh, i hope so. From one of the trailers, he chucks golaith into the church, so prob special throws
[1:29:28] <WanderingSwordsman> 4 also have the history of dmc as well
[1:29:28] <%CEGold> DMC4SE is amazing
[1:29:29] <+NeonTurnip> PepeHands
[1:29:29] <AlasterAngelo> @Fisk_Black_PSN you mean DmC
[1:29:29] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Play Spec Ops: The Line, the TRUE character action game
[1:29:30] <+imextremelymanly> you can beat both 3 and 4 in like a day or two
[1:29:37] <vingadivo> can we get an F for zaibatsu?
[1:29:37] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Fisk_Black_PSN That's some missleading advice for a new guy
[1:29:39] <ramix_the_red> I wasnt sure if he was buffering or if he just had a really long pause
[1:29:42] <Fisk_Black_PSN> @AlasterAngelo Yes that
[1:29:45] <%jermulr> dmc hd collection. ABSOLUTELY picm. that up
[1:29:45] <+sinistersally> @TheDr0t the anti Utsubiaz
[1:29:47] <ScreamingMeat> @TheDr0t It was the name of the entire Super Best Friends Play group before they broke up
[1:29:47] <+Griffin1171> f
[1:29:50] <ArtThouBored> Oh shit DMC2 did we finally trick him into playing?
[1:29:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus i found a video of some broke as gerbera shit if you want to learn to exploit it
[1:29:51] <Midnight_Crest> Buy it so itsuno can fund cvs 3 Kappa
[1:29:53] <vingadivo> F
[1:29:54] <+Mikatonic> wouldn't the demo already show you what to expect

[1:30:18] <joylent_blue> at least play 3 and 4 if you're new VoHiYo they''re great
[1:30:19] <DrkJP520> @WoolieVersus Hold exceed for 1 second at a time to rev up the sword in 3 presses.
[1:30:20] <b_ikki> yeah just play 2
[1:30:21] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus use enemy step to jump cancel combos, its super easy
[1:30:22] <+SuperbWolves> ive played them all XD
[1:30:22] <+Griffin1171> Dante is dead weight
[1:30:22] <+gogo_gadgette> That’s exactly what I did. Finished four and now I’m in the middle of 3
[1:30:25] <%ZaibatsuFan> @WoolieVersus Thanks man
[1:30:29] <oJxn> @WoolieVersus Did you see that they changed the order of 2 and 4?
[1:30:30] <Luvinsus> It's on sale on steam right now
[1:30:31] <+namillus> @WoolieVersus I picked up 4SE in preparation for 5, but I'm really struggling with Dante after getting so into Nero. Any tips?
[1:30:32] <Sofa_King_Hype> I bought all of the old ones for $20
[1:30:32] <+miguelrod777> nah just go straight into 5
[1:30:34] <SpiritLegion> @Vashido22 he knows
[1:30:35] <Laironx3> Dmc2 is an ansolute skip real talk
[1:30:39] <%jermulr> Zaibatsu. play DMC2 first. it can only get better
[1:30:41] <Midnight_Crest> @woolieversus when can we see you do SWORD TRICK SWORD TRICK Kappa
[1:30:42] <%Order_of_Mystery> 4 is on xbone game pass
[1:30:46] <+sinistersally> I just realize I have at least played them all except for the first one
[1:30:51] <Penatron> @WoolieVersus Let go of the gun button while doing rainbow, you don't need to hold it down anymore
[1:30:51] <%FloppytoKey> DmC is a MUST, best one in the series hands down
[1:30:52] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus I have a question since you never seen to talk about it, but how do you feel about Bayonetta series. I haven't seen you guys play it either and I am still pretty new to it.
[1:30:52] <+redanimator> Monster Hunter world trailer for Witcher is big story update adds new fighting style and 2 monsters
[1:30:53] <Vashido22> @SpiritLegion oh, my bad then
[1:30:54] <strangelee> Just got an ad for Not Titanfall, feels bad
[1:30:55] <%ZaibatsuFan> @jermulr WILL DO LUL
[1:30:58] <%CEGold> Who are we hoping for DLC if it sells well? I'm thinking Vergil will be DLC, but my hail mary not gonna happen wish is Credo woolieGASM
[1:31:00] <+TheImmortal70> Its really weird how they changed the order
[1:31:02] <Oqzar> 4SE is on sale right now on steam
[1:31:02] <danknugglit> Buy dmc2 the day apex launches guys LUL
[1:31:05] <ScreamingMeat> I love how the Standard edition shows you their backs while the Deluxe show's their fronts
[1:31:08] <NeroCapone> I love how the difference between the shots is that in the deluxe edition the cast is facing towards you like "Buy this shit motherfucker" LUL
[1:31:11] <+WILDCARD_18> DMC1 pushed me in, should I be worried?
[1:31:15] <+VietcongSamurai> DMC 4 is like -60% on steam for like $9.99.
[1:31:24] <PranaPulse> dmc2 is funny as hell, specially Arius' voice acting towards the end
[1:31:33] <brows_> Is Nero still going to be the demon shamer & Dante the demon slayer? Is V going to be the demon tamer?
[1:31:37] <joylent_blue> i've gotten quite used to holding R2 for gun, my middle finger gets sore after a while LUL
[1:31:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Do I need a permit to pot a two minute YT vid?
[1:31:41] <%TheMilhouseExperience> @namillus Dante gives everyone too many choices at first. Focus on one style and expand on just that. Then expand.
[1:31:48] <DrkJP520> makes sense
[1:31:51] <%CEGold> @NeroCapone "Mom said it's OUR turn to play the Xbox!" LUL
[1:31:51] <+Birdigalore> I wish human Credo got more play in 4
[1:31:55] <AlasterAngelo> Reminder that Goliath is your friend
[1:32:00] <+anime_boyz> if you do the drop kick you can let go of the gun button
[1:32:02] <+fizzguy47> Play claw, like Donguri
[1:32:03] <Sofa_King_Hype> Worked on me @nerocapone
[1:32:06] <SpiritLegion> He means the exceen while you're not fighting
[1:32:07] <ElenaManetta> wtf this isnt a pure S rank demo stream?
[1:32:07] <+Th3SmartAlec> @WILDCARD_18 Eh, I feel they get easier overtime since you get more options, with Nero in 4 being the easiest to play
[1:32:09] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> I wanna see how V controls so bad
[1:32:13] <brows_> Claw grip?
[1:32:15] <%QueequegTheater> Play Spec Ops: The Line
[1:32:15] <NeroCapone> LUL
[1:32:21] <Glitchytripod> you can swing the sword instead of drop kick, too
[1:32:21] <Vashido22> it does
[1:32:21] <+Th3SmartAlec> Trailer?!
[1:32:29] <KaironFortressKnight> Streak too
[1:32:30] <ShinobiPhoenix> I am playing Bayonetta 1 while the stream is on, but have never played the series before.
[1:32:33] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Hi Vergil
[1:32:34] <Oqzar> claw isn't necessary
[1:32:42] <Youwereeatenbyalid> never
[1:32:43] <PranaPulse> air taunt also works for the gun charge thing
[1:32:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @HalfDecent_Gaming Like play for yourself? Cuz Max has a video on DMC5 gameplay out today
[1:32:52] <%jermulr> i swear thats Dante's majin form in that little trailer.
[1:33:01] <%QueequegTheater> Dante went out to buy his cousin Dante some cigarettes
[1:33:03] <%sjay449> What do you think of V @WoolieVersus
[1:33:12] <+Griffin1171> That video's great
[1:33:14] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> OH fuck does he break down V ?@Sphincter_Spelunker
[1:33:16] <%sjay449> You signed my copy of Bayo 1 at Con Bravo
[1:33:18] <%ZaibatsuFan> It was the 1st portion of the game.
[1:33:25] <GeneralHysterics> Full LP
[1:33:25] <+namillus> I am so excited to play as V>
[1:33:26] <+Risingxiv> @woolieversus gun stays charged if u let go during any Arm animation or air taunt
[1:33:29] <DrkJP520> Oh yeah, Pat swung the sword as he let go of the gun button without firing off a bullet.
[1:33:34] <+gamesasacervix> the combat in bayonetta 2 sucks and is so disappointing
[1:33:38] <%jinking79> then y'all played wonderful 101
[1:33:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:33:38] <gunstar73> They beat the game or was that wonderful 101
[1:33:42] <Laironx3> It was a one-off Bayo2 vid
[1:33:43] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @HalfDecent_Gaming Nero, Dante and V. Yeah
[1:33:44] <+Nomenanza> Swor-GU-Tri-Sword-Gu-Tri-Gu-Swo-Gun-Trick
[1:33:45] <+Th3SmartAlec> @gunstar73 101
[1:33:49] <@Menitta> How do you get the taunt to increase style rank? I cant get it to happen consistently lol
[1:33:50] <%ZaibatsuFan> @gunstar73 That was 101 yeah
[1:33:51] <%Order_of_Mystery> Max did a 12 minute vid on DMC5. Watch it while watching this
[1:33:53] <Sofa_King_Hype> @halfdecent_gaming he does go into V’s gameplay. He looks dope.
[1:33:55] <+Irridium> you can also tap b/circle after loading the gun and let go
[1:33:55] <strongglad220> t101LETS t101DO t101THIS
[1:33:57] <KTDelgado> fuck those 2 minibosses in Bay 1
[1:34:03] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> Fuckkkkkk I gotta check this out
[1:34:06] <%QueequegTheater> When Spec Ops: The Line
[1:34:11] <ElenaManetta> This is a cozy HQ
[1:34:14] <+Griffin1171> GRACIOUS AND GLORIOUS
[1:34:15] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus The jump cancel thing is, just jump mid air combos to reset actions, its just way easier now
[1:34:17] <ElenaManetta> This is Arnold's Room: The Van
[1:34:20] <joylent_blue> ahhhh i'd watch Max's new video but i've hit the point where i want to be as blind as possible NotLikeThis
[1:34:21] <C_Sixty_Jam> This game is too sick
[1:34:22] <Dalkalopagus> don't want nothin to do with it
[1:34:25] <reiju_22> the wonderful 101 video is great
[1:34:27] <+bonzosan> even God HAND
[1:34:30] <Mayachacha> Want nuthin to do with DAT
[1:34:31] <nekodelic> ninja gaiden? @woolieversus
[1:34:31] <Laecerelius> That's NASTY!
[1:34:32] <+namillus> @Menitta As with all things, don't overuse taunts. However, a taunt WILL prevent your Style Rank from deteriorating.
[1:34:33] <GeneralHysterics> Marlo Briggs? NUTHIN TA DO WIT IT
[1:34:35] <Vashido22> Jesus, the menus are so sylish
[1:34:36] <MrConductorMan> is there anything different about this demo from that last one?
[1:34:37] <%QueequegTheater> You mean Spec Ops: The Line, the actual true Character Action

[1:35:06] <%jermulr> I feel like i've already seen too many bosses in this game. in gameplay videos.
[1:35:09] <AlasterAngelo> DMC2 is necessary for appreciating how great the rest of the series is

[1:35:13] <PranaPulse> how can we find that video, @fruit_pie_the_magician ?

[1:42:32] <%topendbuzz> woolie has a apex curse
[1:42:34] <SpiritLegion> gerbera first then jump
[1:42:38] <ElenaManetta> The TOP TEN PROBLEMS with Apex Legends And Why You Should Hate It (Run time: 1 hr)
[1:42:42] <+namillus> I mentioned this on Pat's stream, but as a British person I am super into the very deliberate aesthetic design of Redgrave City as a British city.
[1:42:47] <ZeeJiggle> There's been many times in Apex that i go for a double jump or wallrun and just fall and be sad.
[1:42:48] <%chiluzza> pull my devil trigger!
[1:42:48] <Idon__> I am so disappointed with T3, but I am having fun with it honestly
[1:42:50] <joylent_blue> yeah can't lock-on, cuz then snatch comes out
[1:42:50] <+darkmithrionx> Woolie is secretly loving Apex Legends
[1:42:52] <DracaenaLeaf> mmm raspberries
[1:42:57] <Penatron> Nah, you get snatch instead
[1:43:04] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus I stand with you, that game shall not cross my path as long as Titanfall 3 undead
[1:43:07] <Idon__> POW POW
[1:43:11] <Mornaka> dope
[1:43:14] <joylent_blue> FUCK I GOTTA TRY THAT NOWw
[1:43:14] <MrConductorMan> dude imagine fighting an airborne boss with this tech and having a rad anime air battle
[1:43:29] <%Order_of_Mystery> didn't they confirm that titanfall 3 is coming later this year?
[1:43:33] <ElenaManetta> Woolie why are you even touching the ground now that you know the tech
[1:43:34] <extradopeness> Wish Woolie would hurry up and buy all the copies of Titanfall 2 in MTL
[1:43:36] <+dodge_and_dust> i think you can do that trick off of other moves too
[1:43:36] <Idon__> anyone that fights using recoil is cool
[1:43:41] <%jermulr> The design of redgrave city is super panglobal. they have british red busses and roadsigns between french shops and american roads
[1:43:43] <+Dovakhin573> I guess Nero can now style fly too Kappa
[1:43:57] <Worldbrand> @Order_of_Mystery They said a "premium titanfall game" that is not f2p or mobile or a VR game is in the works
[1:44:00] <ElenaManetta> AWWwww
[1:44:00] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus You can use the air taunt to charge the gun too. Charge, air taunt and rev to also gain the exceed.
[1:44:00] <Penatron> @WoolieVersus If you release the charge while doing any animation you can't cancel, you keep all the charged shots
[1:44:01] <AlasterAngelo> enemies dying too fast
[1:44:02] <ElenaManetta> He was trying to run!
[1:44:04] <+CommanderSqueaks> @jermulr Redgrave city is secretly a section of Disneyworld.
[1:44:10] <%QueequegTheater> BOO PUT THE SONG BACK ON
[1:44:11] <joylent_blue> the Hells take much more damage and are better for practice
[1:44:16] <MrConductorMan> the red ridable arm is soooo stylin' in this
[1:44:17] <ShinobiPhoenix> @order_of_mystery you missed this week's podcast, didn't you?
[1:44:18] <+namillus> Phoneboxes, hazard barriers... Even the ambulance is a British one.
[1:44:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dragging them upward with the wire works to get them in range for the first gerbera burst
[1:44:26] <%jermulr> @commandersqueaks and the tree is the castle
[1:44:30] <Kalcom> YO
[1:44:32] <+dodge_and_dust> you can let go of the gun when throwing out punchline too

[1:52:31] <KaironFortressKnight> yes

[1:53:29] <Xisalex> SECRET RED ORBS
[1:53:30] <SpiritLegion> its all timing, gotta jump a lil before calibur hits
[1:53:32] <ShinobiPhoenix> but Snatcher 2, I have wanted for years. easily could have been a mobile game.
[1:53:35] <SpiritLegion> but you good
[1:53:36] <Xisalex> not like you need them
[1:53:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> @WoolieVersus This is the hours on input practive
[1:53:41] <SpiritLegion> you're already doing very good
[1:53:41] <Xisalex> No! On the HORSE
[1:53:46] <joylent_blue> you can shoot them, but you can't get close enough
[1:53:47] <KaironFortressKnight> sorbs
[1:53:50] <RekknLIVE> this is a new dmc demo?
[1:53:51] <+dodge_and_dust> use punchline
[1:53:52] <%FloppytoKey> you CAN
[1:53:53] <extradopeness> Man those floaty jumps look amazing
[1:53:54] <ScreamingMeat> SRORBS
[1:53:55] <PranaPulse> he knows about the horse orbs already
[1:54:06] <RantingRavager> secret orbs are only for good boys
[1:54:08] <%Cavumentum> horbs
[1:54:11] <+Th3SmartAlec> Those orbs are doing an A-rank taunt on you
[1:54:12] <joylent_blue> RekknLIVE yes, new breaker arm, new enemy encounter, shop menu is available
[1:54:12] <SpiritLegion> small rooms are good for calibur
[1:54:18] <+cvp5127> use the air gerbera
[1:54:23] <SpiritLegion> cause you can stick them in a corner and practice easy
[1:54:24] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Is he still playing the demo?
[1:54:26] <Xisalex> Calibur, jump, shot, calibur
[1:54:40] <%terminallyCapriciousz> This looks new
[1:54:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:45] <Xisalex> Almost!
[1:54:48] <+jorgamund> is the camera supposed to be swinging behind the curtains like that?
[1:54:49] <joylent_blue> terminallyCapriciousz its the new demo yeah
[1:55:00] <%terminallyCapriciousz> oh shiiiiit, nice @joylent_blue thanks
[1:55:02] <SpiritLegion> THERE IT WAS
[1:55:10] <SpiritLegion> YOU GOT A CALIBUR SWORD HIT
[1:55:12] <AFoolishPaper> JINKIES
[1:55:16] <SpiritLegion> hell ye PogChamp
[1:55:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus You can pin them against the corners and do the gerbera infinitely
[1:55:21] <Xisalex> eyyyyy
[1:55:22] <joylent_blue> LUL oh man
[1:55:27] <Xisalex> gotta put the shot in man,
[1:55:30] <%ZaibatsuFan> Who else is dancing right now?
[1:55:31] <+SinisterBroccoli> No training mode in the demo I'm guessing?
[1:55:40] <joylent_blue> SinisterBroccoli no unfortunately
[1:55:40] <+bonzosan> nope
[1:55:53] <Xisalex> an eaiser way to do it would be to replace the shot with a bringer
[1:56:02] <%ZaibatsuFan> just me cool
[1:56:07] <SpiritLegion> put him in the corner
[1:56:12] <SpiritLegion> that way it'll be easier
[1:56:19] <SpiritLegion> he wont jump back as much
[1:56:23] <%FloppytoKey> are these enemies new btw?
[1:56:24] <+MildConviction> @WoolieVersus is this the taunt jet upper of DMCV
[1:56:26] <%CEGold> @ZaibatsuFan You can dance if you want to
[1:56:35] <ItsZelus> NICE PogChamp
[1:56:36] <%ZaibatsuFan> LUL
[1:56:36] <Worldbrand> this is like how i felt when i was learning air combos in my anime fighters
[1:56:40] <Xisalex> You're not connecting the second enemy stop because you're missing the shot.
[1:56:41] <LeeOhX> whats wools trying to do?
[1:56:42] <%QueequegTheater> EUGGGH
[1:56:44] <joylent_blue> LUL maaaan this tech is sick
[1:56:57] <%jermulr> 3 caliburs in a row
[1:56:58] <+KSabot> did woolie rebind the gun?
[1:56:58] <joylent_blue> LeeOhX basically an infinite calibur string
[1:57:05] <kamen_advent> You can do multiple calibur in the air?
[1:57:07] <+dodge_and_dust> @KSabot yes
[1:57:12] <Xisalex> It's possible
[1:57:14] <joylent_blue> kamen_advent only after an enemy step
[1:57:14] <LeeOhX> Sounds tough
[1:57:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus you can infinite gerbera them in the corner against the ceiling
[1:57:21] <Oqzar> you dont have to do calibur
[1:57:23] <C_Sixty_Jam> Can't you have an infinite enemy in Nico's "try it" menu?
[1:57:35] <SpiritLegion> you can do calibur, shot calibur shot and then infinite
[1:57:38] <joylent_blue> C_Sixty_Jam no, its not available when you click on it
[1:57:38] <EnderGamma> try it isn't available
[1:57:46] <C_Sixty_Jam> Oh ok
[1:57:47] <Oqzar> you can JC split or whatever you feel like
[1:57:51] <+VietcongSamurai> I hope they release Legendary Dark Knight on launch for this game or something similar.
[1:57:59] <+KSabot> you aren't close enough for the JC after 2nd caliber
[1:58:08] <SpiritLegion> @KSabot its definitely there
[1:58:12] <+VietcongSamurai> That mixed in with the coop mode would be chaos.
[1:58:21] <SpiritLegion> you'll just have to play through the game like 2-3 times first probably
[1:58:22] <%QueequegTheater> Hey look at that DmC
[1:58:27] <Worldbrand> i can visualize woolie's exp bar going up
[1:58:31] <Itachi312> Legendary dark knight would have to be PC only or wait for PS5
[1:58:34] <AlasterAngelo> I'm getting really sick of that stupid tree
[1:58:36] <SpiritLegion> its gotta be faster, yeah
[1:58:55] <SpiritLegion> and the jump you do must be the fastest tap, so you dont end up jumping too high
[1:59:03] <%ZaibatsuFan> Wooooah, just got Spiderman vibes LUL
[1:59:06] <joylent_blue> getting the "shall we dance?" taunt right as punchline comes back to his arm is fantastic LUL
[1:59:12] <LeeOhX> So i've never played any of the other DMCs but this looks so dope, i might start with this one
[1:59:14] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:59:15] <theotrainwreck> lol pat did the same thing
[1:59:28] <%QueequegTheater> @LeeOhX Start with 4
[1:59:44] <SpiritLegion> maybe try non charged shot
[1:59:45] <joylent_blue> LeeOhX 3 or 4 would also be great starting points
[1:59:49] <neooneshin> is this a demo
[1:59:50] <Xisalex> it comes out faster AFTER a JC
[1:59:56] <matheuspomp> yes
[1:59:58] <SpiritLegion> non charged shot might be faster
[1:59:58] <joylent_blue> yep neooneshin its the new one
[2:00:01] <Xisalex> Shot will come out immediately after a JC
[2:00:15] <LeeOhX> 4's the one that introduced nero right
[2:00:15] <neooneshin> will this game have vergi
[2:00:16] <AllCorruptingHarlot> Are you telling me the trailer was doing jump canceling? I'm shocking the movement in this game is so advanced lmao.
[2:00:23] <AllCorruptingHarlot> shocked*
[2:00:25] <LeeOhX> I might as well
[2:00:32] <%CEGold> I can't wait to see what donguri and UltimeSon does with this game woolieGASM
[2:00:36] <ModeratelyHardcore> That jump cancel teq is serious. Getting close to S rank
[2:00:37] <joylent_blue> LeeOhX yeah that was nero's first game
[2:00:38] <Kalcom> it will super maybe
[2:00:46] <heroneiden> @WoolieVersus is this on ps4 or pc
[2:00:50] <joylent_blue> ps4
[2:00:53] <joylent_blue> not on pc at all
[2:00:56] <AllCorruptingHarlot> DMC fighting game when :^)
[2:01:03] <Vashido22> me.neither
[2:01:06] <+Muzzle131> hello everyone cryW
[2:01:07] <TsunTsuchinoko> bloody labo
[2:01:08] <Oqzar> surprising he never practiced this in 4
[2:01:10] <nobknee> There will be a steam version.
[2:01:13] <joylent_blue> Muzzle131 howdy VoHiYo
[2:01:14] <%mikeiskill> i've never been more stoked for training mode in a single player game
[2:01:28] <heroneiden> does anyone know when the pc version will come out
[2:01:35] <Xisalex> Oh yeah
[2:01:39] <SpiritLegion> yes
[2:01:40] <SpiritLegion> YES!!
[2:01:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:01:42] <thepiefoot> @heroneiden Of the demo ?
[2:01:44] <joylent_blue> heroneiden it probably won't
[2:01:44] <LeeOhX> I'm a sucker for combo for style games
[2:01:45] <Xisalex> JC's Goliath is just as easy as it was with Berial
[2:01:45] <nobknee> I dunno, haven't looked since I added it to my wishlist.
[2:02:00] <nobknee> @joylent_blue It is on my steam wishlist right now.
[2:02:04] <%QueequegTheater> I've never seen any evidence that Calibur is actually a thing that exists. Woolie is clearly in on the conspiracy
[2:02:13] <heroneiden> yeah i preordered th steam code
[2:02:25] <joylent_blue> nobknee no i meant the demo
[2:02:32] <+Muzzle131> how the demo?
[2:02:32] <+dodge_and_dust> you can stop holding it on snatch too
[2:02:34] <nobknee> Oh, gotcha, sorry.
[2:02:37] <ModeratelyHardcore> can you explain it one more time
[2:02:39] <+VietcongSamurai> I wonder if/when they release a pc demo. How quickly modders/data miners would be able to find stuff in it like RE2.
[2:02:40] <joylent_blue> its ok
[2:02:42] <neooneshin> where is vergil
[2:02:48] <Kalcom> DEAd

[2:04:38] <thepiefoot> Excuse me, did Woolie did a reverse calibur? Is reverse attack a thing again ?

[2:09:12] <Xisalex> @WoolieVersus You CAN'T do it with Overture. YOu need to use Gerbera, Calibur or SHuffle
[2:09:12] <Penatron> @WoolieVersus Consider putting Devil Breaker on a trigger instead of gun for smoother Break Age

[2:09:39] <+vinlyxg> How is he playing the game
[2:09:40] <thepiefoot> Lies, Pat can't do shit
[2:09:46] <Archmortal> It does not need to be calibur to deflect it, a regular hit will work
[2:09:46] <DrkJP520> Is this on PS4 Pro?
[2:09:48] <SpiritLegion> shuffle, hightime
[2:09:49] <Rngiddion> just a normal
[2:09:52] <ivansonic08> is a demo
[2:09:52] <SpiritLegion> YOU CAN DO OVERTURE
[2:09:53] <joylent_blue> any melee attack does it i think?
[2:09:53] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus A normal slash can deflect it
[2:09:54] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus Have you seen the V gameplay they have on youtube now? It looks rad as fuck dude
[2:09:55] <SpiritLegion> IVE SEEN IT
[2:09:55] <+Riseskimo> Just basic Red Queen hit is enough, shuffle is not necessary
[2:10:01] <Ordinaryknight> Shoot, doing it with red queen is new tech to me
[2:10:05] <SpiritLegion> ANY MELEE FROM RED Q OR OVERTURE
[2:10:05] <joylent_blue> instead of the gun i think
[2:10:06] <Rngiddion> all you need is a normal
[2:10:16] <Idon__> just swing
[2:10:17] <SpiritLegion> Yup
[2:10:19] <PranaPulse> like Phantom...
[2:10:22] <+bonzosan> yep
[2:10:22] <+Th3SmartAlec> Woolie will figure it out
[2:10:23] <Vashido22> LUL
[2:10:23] <+VietcongSamurai> Thats how pat did it. LUL
[2:10:26] <NJigglypuff> so do you swing?
[2:10:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, this may seem like an odd question, but have you seen that Kirby Bayonetta comic?
[2:10:27] <+HyperCharge_Sam> LUL
[2:10:31] <thepiefoot> Just like Hell Vanguard in DMC3
[2:10:31] <nmaten> is the video game thing
[2:10:36] <Xisalex> But it looks cooler with a Clibur
[2:10:36] <%DXLelouch24> Wezelda now
[2:10:37] <DarkKnightGrave> Swing First Nigga
[2:10:43] <Idon__> ooh, that back tattoo Kreygasm

[2:10:47] <joylent_blue> ye
[2:10:50] <candidateplays> Lul, it's the energy balls from the Angelos again
[2:10:56] <Penatron> @WoolieVersus Breaker instead of gun. You don't need gun on trigger when you can keep the charge shots through air taunt, rainbow, etc.
[2:11:16] <joylent_blue> with the rorbs you have you could easily buy 99 or all three arms btw @WoolieVersus LUL
[2:11:20] <SpiritLegion> if its 100 rorbs per arm
[2:11:22] <SpiritLegion> its fine
[2:11:31] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Punch line reminds me of Aquila from DmC
[2:11:35] <Theonlypegsus> @WoolieVersus Yo Woolie. Max uploaded a new video. He got to play the other DMCV characters and did a little review on em. (Y'all probably already know this though but wanted to update)
[2:11:48] <Idon__> Apparently you can't control Nightmare. Shame
[2:11:49] <SpiritLegion> easiest is hightime with exceed
[2:11:53] <SpiritLegion> you get a huge window
[2:11:57] <ivansonic08> Overture is for parrying BIG attacks
[2:11:58] <Ordinaryknight> @theonlypegsus he got to play V?
[2:12:06] <Theonlypegsus> Yup
[2:12:10] <Oqzar> 10 year old dmc4 tech Kreygasm
[2:12:12] <ScreamingMeat> There's some pretty sick metal covers of Devil Trigger on youtube
[2:12:12] <Vashido22> no problem man
[2:12:16] <joylent_blue> Max using his capcom connections
[2:12:17] <Theonlypegsus> He got to play V and Dante

[2:13:06] <SpiritLegion> @VVardy you can Jump cancel them infinitely
[2:13:08] <Idon__> Nero better be in MvC4
[2:13:10] <Xisalex> Logically, you can do them infintely, it's just hard to learn the timing

[2:13:31] <SpiritLegion> @EnderGamma Thank you ^^
[2:13:33] <CerberusDriver> if they really want to do the Capgod Redemption Arc, we need Capcom vs SNK 3

[2:13:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus Just so you know, most of this stuff works almost identically in DMC4, so you can go back now and jump cancel the ever loving shit there too
[2:14:06] <+Th3SmartAlec> We need Capcom Vs Marvel.
[2:14:21] <ScreamingMeat> So apparently this uses the same Engine as RE7 and RE2make. Goddamn I want to see an Onimusha game in this engine. A Remake or reboot, or SOMETHING
[2:14:22] <joylent_blue> i'm gonna practice that gerbera and calibur tech later for SURE

[2:15:25] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus can i show the clip of pat deflecting the ball?
[2:15:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> Woolie's getting emotional

[2:17:12] <+Bowser93> does flux still work good
[2:17:15] <DrkJP520> Looking forward to RE2?
[2:17:18] <Idon__> "Just have some DAMN faith"
[2:17:21] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus can i show the clip of pat deflecting the ball?
[2:17:22] <spacecatstreams> i use the flux
[2:17:32] <danknugglit> I have a plan
[2:17:42] <ManOfReason> I have that exact same problem woolie
[2:17:46] <konami2010> I thought I was just bad for having that problem
[2:17:48] <%UrsulaCat> I used flux and then flux crashed and I never bothered restarting it
[2:17:59] <vingadivo> have you tried to just do combo?
[2:18:06] <joylent_blue> just do combo 4Head
[2:18:11] <%UrsulaCat> my problem: I draw pixel art for fun and flux really messes with that
[2:18:11] <SpiritLegion> putting a sword hit in between can help
[2:18:18] <spacecatstreams> what is that face in the top right corner?
[2:18:25] <+Vivaciousx3> @WoolieVersus try jump canceling out of the last hit of roulette
[2:18:26] <Idon__> Just put the entire combo on a macro 4Head
[2:18:29] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> rorbs
[2:18:29] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus since I dont' see a mod, can I show you a link? For ideas with calibur jump cancel, its really short
[2:18:33] <CerberusDriver> just press the button
[2:18:41] <joylent_blue> spacecatstreams its the red orb's face
[2:18:52] <joylent_blue> oh no the enemy did combo
[2:18:53] <Idon__> I wonder if tablehopper's gonna come back
[2:18:54] <seylumiue> You can shoot while dodging woolz
[2:19:03] <danknugglit> Nice pat impression
[2:19:12] <theotrainwreck> midgame lab session
[2:19:14] <ShinBazelgeuse> is Shuffle's backdash invincible?
[2:19:16] <%UrsulaCat> Woolie does a surprisingly accurate pat
[2:19:18] <thepiefoot> Table Hopper is in the demo ?
[2:19:24] <joylent_blue> i don't think table hopper is necessary anymore, the regular sideroll as i-frames
[2:19:29] <+Vivaciousx3> @WoolieVersus try jump canceling out of the last hit of roulette
[2:19:29] <joylent_blue> has*
[2:19:33] <%UrsulaCat> I remember back in the day when I couldn't tell pat's and woolie's voices apart
[2:19:34] <FairOnFire> I didn't see table hopper in the move list
[2:19:35] <LeeOhX> WHAT THE HELL
[2:19:37] <spacecatstreams> @joylent_blue looks like the guy from the spongebob hotsauce episode
[2:19:37] <PranaPulse> table hopper is not in the demo i believe, its not listed as a skill
[2:19:40] <LeeOhX> THIS IS THE COOLEST
[2:19:40] <danknugglit> Since when is pat black?
[2:19:41] <Idon__> breaker... breaks it
[2:19:49] <+Th3SmartAlec> !R1
[2:19:50] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus can i show the clip of pat deflecting the ball?
[2:19:58] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus can I show you a link for calibur jump cancel ideas? its short
[2:20:04] <ZippyPsycho> How do you do that?
[2:20:05] <+Vivaciousx3> @WoolieVersus try jump canceling out of the last hit of roulette
[2:20:15] <%UrsulaCat> are any mods in chat
[2:20:16] <DrkJP520> Why would you not spend it on uppercut?
[2:20:25] <konami2010> jump more
[2:20:27] <konami2010> off the horse
[2:20:30] <spacecatstreams> hello yes i am a mod

[2:23:50] <randomness_yo> Gotta let it out, gotta let it out?
[2:23:54] <Worldbrand> you what? is there a zapping system?
[2:23:58] <joylent_blue> PranaPulse i don't think so? some missions you can play multiple characters, but pretty sure Nero is first
[2:24:05] <thepiefoot> Move fast baby don't be slow !
[2:24:24] <Idon__> I wonder if Nightmare can only be summoned in open outdoor spaces
[2:24:24] <PranaPulse> whoa interesting
[2:24:55] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Use SWORD to parry Goliath's projectiles, not Overture, btw

[2:25:23] <+FlubbedPig> Oh, yeah, I was gone
[2:25:24] <DaringOcelot> i remwmber reading that you could choose which campaign you wanna start with first and they all started at different points
[2:25:28] <joylent_blue> Vashido22 your motivation shows apatDab
[2:25:29] <Xisalex> Hey wools, I think you could have used the "try" option when you bought the skills, but I'm not sure.
[2:25:40] <DaringOcelot> try button doesnt work in demo
[2:25:44] <+Vivaciousx3> @WoolieVersus do you know the overture downward move? if your above an enemy it will do a groundbounce
[2:25:45] <PranaPulse> you can't you "Try" in the demo
[2:26:02] <+VietcongSamurai> @Xisalex It's locked so you cant access it
[2:26:02] <Vashido22> @joylent_blue I needed MORE POWER

[2:26:24] <RantingRavager> Woolie Will Figure it out (Eventually)
[2:26:27] <+Qsmash_> The Time Frame is like 8 hours
[2:26:29] <%Piemen99> woolieSMUG
[2:26:30] <Ordinaryknight> Ok, back from Max’s video. V looks neat
[2:26:36] <Idon__> How long till we see Nero atomic buster something in HD
[2:26:38] <Worldbrand> If you have it locked down before the game comes out, it's gonna be so goddamn fun to watch
[2:26:44] <DaringOcelot> is there V gameplay?
[2:26:45] <Midnight_Crest> Good thing exceeds are easier in 5 coz of the lack of turbo mode
[2:26:45] <arfsm95> when's dmc 5 dropping?

[2:27:45] <hntronium> Woolie could you please tell Pat to at least try to lab in dbfz
[2:27:46] <Idon__> Punch Line for the sweet shoryu
[2:27:46] <PranaPulse> are the turbo modes good in the previous games? currently playing through the series for the first time, and wondering if that mode is more for after your 1st playthrough
[2:27:48] <%mikeiskill> any chance at any more DMC4 bloody palace streaming before release?
[2:27:48] <+SirG005E> nico big waifu

[2:27:53] <HanPaul> heh willy
[2:27:56] <CerberusDriver> @joylent_blue i gotta wait cause physical
[2:27:57] <+VariantX7> nico's van is better than some dusty old statues any day of the week
[2:27:58] <DSD24> Hi Woolie!
[2:28:05] <DSD24> Hello everyone!
[2:28:09] <Idon__> HeyGuys
[2:28:10] <Vashido22> Nico would be best girl if it wasn't for Lady
[2:28:13] <HanPaul> DSD24 TehePelo
[2:28:18] <+UnderpaidBob> hello today
[2:28:24] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Hot takes: Nico attractive
[2:28:25] <DSD24> @VariantX7 Personally I always liked those statues they had good music
[2:28:25] <+ssjklyco> DMC with an item shop seems strange
[2:28:25] <joylent_blue> CerberusDriver physicals are nice to have, i just get so impatient
[2:28:30] <+Big_Dream> Begone thot
[2:28:31] <+Superkbrown95> So, im new to dmc lore, what was the point of the reboot if they were just gonna continue 5 in the original universe?
[2:28:49] <CerberusDriver> @joylent_blue yeah its the collectors edition so I hope the shippers dont screw me
[2:28:50] <joylent_blue> the reboot had no point 4Head
[2:28:50] <DSD24> @Superkbrown95 That reboot didn't do good so they decided to go back
[2:28:52] <+Ez8Razgriz19> i love that she just has a goddess statue in the van like a souvenir
[2:28:52] <+Ryallen> @Superkbrown95 It was made by a different company
[2:28:52] <Idon__> So, what exactly does Nico do with the crystalised blood of demons anyhow
[2:28:53] <thepiefoot> @Superkbrown95 Cause Inafune fucks everything up
[2:28:55] <%UrsulaCat> @Superkbrown95 I think it failed?
[2:28:56] <HanPaul> Lady's redesign is ass dont @ me 4Head
[2:28:56] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Superkbrown95 it wasn't, they wanted to reboot but they backed down super hard
[2:29:03] <+Ryallen> And they wanted to do a bunch of new shit with the series that no one liked
[2:29:04] <joylent_blue> CerberusDriver ohhh nice
[2:29:05] <Vashido22> @Idon__ she uses demon asses
[2:29:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @HanPaul it isn''t even a redesign tho
[2:29:11] <+VariantX7> there was no point in the reboot because literally no one asked for a DMC reboot in the first place
[2:29:13] <+Morning_Asakura> @HanPaul sike
[2:29:18] <%ZaibatsuFan> @Superkbrown95 The fact this game even exists is a miracle.
[2:29:19] <HanPaul> DansGame
[2:29:22] <Idon__> Inafune asked for a DMC reboot LUL
[2:29:23] <+ssjklyco> @superkbrown95 the point was to make Call of duty money and appeal to Western audience
[2:29:24] <ModeratelyHardcore> @Superkbrown95 because executives are stupid and the couple million DMC 4 sold wasn't good enough for their dumb asses and they thought an edgy American version would sell CoD numbers
[2:29:30] <CerberusDriver> anyone notice how Capcom redemption started when Inafune left? Coincidence?
[2:29:35] <DSD24> DMC4 was the best selling game in the series and they rebooted after it
[2:29:38] <HanPaul> her face model doesn't match aand doesn't look like a perfect doll DansGame
[2:29:40] <ModeratelyHardcore> and they were wrong
[2:29:41] <%UrsulaCat> be nice to inafune
[2:29:44] <joylent_blue> no coincidence, thats for sure
[2:29:44] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:29:45] <+Superkbrown95> Huh, thats so strange, thx for all the answers yall :)
[2:29:48] <Worldbrand> @Superkbrown95 a pineapple is a multiple fruit, the core is the stem that the flowers grow on
[2:29:51] <%UrsulaCat> he's only trying his best
[2:30:03] <Idon__> Time to flex the BUDGET
[2:30:06] <HanPaul> Inafune is like a reverse Xenophobe LUL
[2:30:10] <DSD24> I love how good the Blue Rose sounds
[2:30:10] <+Morning_Asakura> inafune faded away like in that video
[2:30:13] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Nero is STRONGEST in the AIR
[2:30:25] <joylent_blue> Blue Rose sounds like a fucking shotgun
[2:30:25] <%ZaibatsuFan> @Superkbrown95 doodGood
[2:30:29] <%Ez8Razgriz19> Inawho?
[2:30:37] <Idon__> You see Nero isn't some punk style-beast he's an emo hobo
[2:30:44] <@akuda_bar> ina-who-ne
[2:30:49] <%UrsulaCat> @Worldbrand I like this fruit info please share more
[2:30:56] <joylent_blue> LUL
[2:30:59] <Worldbrand> would you describe this era of capcom as being out-a-fune?
[2:31:03] <+Qsmash_> wuuuut
[2:31:06] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Comedic Improve is hard
[2:31:06] <%ZaibatsuFan> Plz everyone, let's just talk about how ITSUNO IS THE NEW GOAT.
[2:31:09] <DSD24> You guys saw that V does air violin as one of his taunts?
[2:31:10] <+Qsmash_> I didn't know about that
[2:31:16] <AlasterAngelo> N I C E
[2:31:16] <thepiefoot> Woolie did the cool thing
[2:31:17] <Idon__> In-a-fool-a
[2:31:19] <Vashido22> yeyeyeyeye
[2:31:27] <CerberusDriver> NOW MAKE A WISH
[2:31:32] <Idon__> WHERE YOU GOIN, BOI
[2:31:34] <joylent_blue> shoot gun to manually detonate the bomb btw
[2:31:40] <+jyeowa> ???
[2:31:41] <CerberusDriver> You can shoot the bomb as well
[2:31:46] <Worldbrand> @UrsulaCat i didnt come prepared with a briefcase full of fruit facts but i'll be ready next time
[2:31:50] <Idon__> oh noooooo
[2:31:52] <joylent_blue> too far away Jebaited
[2:31:53] <%UrsulaCat> aww
[2:31:57] <AlasterAngelo> THE GOOD SHIT
[2:32:01] <%ZaibatsuFan> Oh how embarrassing Kappa
[2:32:01] <+VariantX7> lol If you could beam struggle that shit I would die on the spot
[2:32:01] <thepiefoot> i just noticed that they took out the explosion out of charged shot 3 and gave it to the Breaker. Cool.
[2:32:20] <%ZaibatsuFan> PERFECT
[2:32:20] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[2:32:26] <joylent_blue> PERFECT
[2:32:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> You can counter that
[2:32:27] <arkv01> look man neros moves are RAD but his lines are teenage levels of stale
[2:32:29] <PranaPulse> @VariantX7 i tried it :[ either i did it wrong or it doesn't work
[2:32:35] <DSD24> That was a good punch
[2:32:39] <arkv01> OF THE GOOD SHIT
[2:32:42] <Vashido22> @arkv01 because THAT'S Nero
[2:32:43] <Idon__> PREDICTED VOICELINE
[2:32:43] <Jackeral> hey @woolieversus or his mods, is it cool if i post a link to some punch line gameplay off the DMC subreddit?
[2:32:49] <+Morning_Asakura> that good shit
[2:32:50] <%Ez8Razgriz19> Itd be awesome if Woolz did a few of the MP missions with like Reggie or Pat
[2:32:51] <SpiritLegion> Woolie, there is a pretty easy calibur combo you can do, that works even if you do it pretty slow, its Calibur, JC, snach, repeat
[2:32:55] <arkv01> good shits his only fun line
[2:32:56] <HanPaul> orduv Kreygasm
[2:32:58] <gnarly_memes_bro> its like the soda gun from kirby all over again
[2:33:01] <+MightyMaxT> A little smell of the poo
[2:33:01] <%ZaibatsuFan> Hey Woolie, did you know that you can counter that fireball? Kappa
[2:33:04] <joylent_blue> Nero is just a dork give him a break
[2:33:07] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus remember to shoot the bomb, I think it gives more style too
[2:33:07] <Idon__> I think I've heard Goliath's quotes more than i've heard Dante and V talk.
[2:33:09] <SpiritLegion> If you want a small showcase lmk I have a small clip of that
[2:33:10] <%Piemen99> that's hot
[2:33:11] <DSD24> Aeeeeee
[2:33:12] <seltekh> Gerbera's dodge move probably reflects the fireball
[2:33:14] <+jyeowa> nero and goliath's ball fighting shirtless in the rain
[2:33:18] <PranaPulse> is it that Blank video @Jackeral ?
[2:33:20] <Fujiwara_92> WE NEED A S BRO
[2:33:21] <joylent_blue> "one more"
[2:33:26] <@akuda_bar> a nice sip of the good shit
[2:33:27] <%UrsulaCat> say more french words @WoolieVersus
[2:33:29] <joylent_blue> yeah right
[2:33:37] <%kamikazeturtleX> Punch line is so hype
[2:33:39] <Ordinaryknight> Who wanted the dm to max’s video?
[2:33:46] <+anime_boyz> do you think you can finish dmc5 before sekiro comes out woolz?
[2:33:47] <+SirG005E> HANDY, eh?
[2:33:50] <arkv01> I hope goliath gets converted to our side cause he's a pretty cool guy
[2:33:57] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ye
[2:33:59] <DrkJP520> Handy, hah! I get it
[2:34:00] <Plague_Nurse> pfft
[2:34:00] <Jackeral> no, it's "Punch line is, without a doubt, my favorite breaker"
[2:34:06] <Cthulos> rocketo panch
[2:34:08] <tacostarvedbeast> Yes
[2:34:11] <Jolly_Adventurer> Say omelette du fromage
[2:34:15] <ScreamingMeat> Eh?
[2:34:16] <+cvp5127> oui oui
[2:34:18] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus see ya later man, I'm glad you liked the combos, its so surreal since you guys are one of the reasons I love dmc

[2:35:06] <@Moobot> Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Jackeral
[2:35:07] <Plague_Nurse> Do you speak spanish?
[2:35:09] <Xisalex> @WoolieVersus Can I show you a little of my experimentation with JC?
[2:35:10] <vVAstrAVv> gascwang
[2:35:11] <+PenmanLupine> are we getting more Woolie vs Chat?
[2:35:13] <%UrsulaCat> don't do that again @WoolieVersus please
[2:35:14] <+SirG005E> I called it tear ass house to someone and they looked at me like i had 5 heads, and i knew it should have been terris but fuck you guys
[2:35:15] <+miguelrod777> it sounds the same if you drop the u so why not
[2:35:17] <joylent_blue> @WoolieVersus @Jackeral has a cool link
[2:35:20] <ZeeJiggle> yo man those U's are expensive. this is a recession
[2:35:21] <+Vivaciousx3> yeah i can send a link
[2:35:24] <seylumiue> Do the DRI in the air!
[2:35:28] <Rexenexus> I've got some punch line tech @WoolieVersus on twitter tho
[2:35:29] <gunstar73> French is dumb I’ll die on this hill
[2:35:29] <Jackeral> yes
[2:35:32] <konami2010> all I know is you gotta jump onto that bridge man
[2:35:36] <%mikeiskill> punchline seems like it's good for locking a separate enemy down
[2:35:48] <CerberusDriver> Jump on the horses head, and onto the arch for more hidden orbs
[2:35:52] <PranaPulse> @Jackeral oh thats your video! good shit. I was wondering, in the beginning after you fire off Punch Line and it hits and enemy. i see it shoot straight up. is there an input for that or it just happened?
[2:35:56] <%kamikazeturtleX> I does the job of the gun but with hitstun
[2:36:00] <+Vivaciousx3> i have a link for tech
[2:36:01] <arkv01> french could be worse
[2:36:04] <Xisalex> Punchline holds enemies up better than shots, gives you more freedom
[2:36:06] <arkv01> french could be portuguese
[2:36:09] <MelBrooksKA> @WoolieVersus The U's are there because old English people wanted their language to look like fake French
[2:36:10] <ebonifragaria> French is the reason English is fucked up
[2:36:10] <Worldbrand> english is such a stapled-together language
[2:36:19] <@Solidus_113> There, Their, They're
[2:36:22] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus I may be super behind again, but have you tried Punch Line's breakage in the air yet?
[2:36:27] <gnarly_memes_bro> language is dumb, grunts are the only words a real man needs
[2:36:29] <DrMoose7> every language is dumb
[2:36:30] <DSD24> You don't like hermano and hermana?
[2:36:32] <ManOfReason> DONT shittalk spanish like that
[2:36:35] <ivansonic08> Is spanish gender is related to LETTERS
[2:36:38] <%UrsulaCat> I like spanish
[2:36:40] <+conqab> languages evolve
[2:36:40] <arkv01> french in 2019 InuyoFace
[2:36:40] <vincerocmm> like spanish
[2:36:42] <theotrainwreck> spanish sux
[2:36:43] <Kalcom> as a non english speaker
[2:36:45] <SpiritLegion> Yeah my language is like that too
[2:36:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:36:47] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus so basically every latin language
[2:36:52] <%Ez8Razgriz19> Ok skullface woolie
[2:36:53] <gunstar73> Spanish makes sense tho
[2:36:53] <DrkJP520> Swedish has "gender", but it's not a matter of male or female
[2:36:57] <Dalkalopagus> but if we don't gender household objects how will people know if they want to fuck them?
[2:36:58] <+Dovakhin573> Idk it makes for some funny context shit
[2:36:59] <alwayspronking> @DSD24 I think he's talking about objects, not people.
[2:37:00] <CalderGaming> @WoolieVersus look up how many "genders" native Hawaiian has, it's nuts
[2:37:00] <%UrsulaCat> ah
[2:37:01] <Worldbrand> You think that's bad? the german word for "girl" is considered not a male or female noun, but a neuter one
[2:37:01] <+Nomicro4u> pidgin is the superior language
[2:37:02] <Luvinsus> Portuguese fucking SUCKS, english is so much easier
[2:37:03] <Cthulos> une petite legume
[2:37:03] <Youwereeatenbyalid> hi Punch mom!
[2:37:05] <Kalcom> fuck french
[2:37:05] <AMajorTom> Crack pipe is feminine
[2:37:06] <arkv01> what, whats neutral?
[2:37:08] <%a_mad_dragon> what about languages that conjugate based on how "alive" the words are Kappa
[2:37:10] <joylent_blue> hi punch mom VoHiYo

[2:37:11] <Prevot> I think not having gender it's stupid
[2:37:11] <%Piemen99> PUNCH MOM

[2:37:15] <+tkfromthe90s> Yo*

[2:38:16] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Might be super behind again, but have you tried Punch Line's breakage in the air yet?
[2:38:19] <Worldbrand> woolie is punch daddy
[2:38:23] <joylent_blue> Woolie is our father
[2:38:27] <%UrsulaCat> @nobknee woolie misspoke and said the genders in some languages were french/english/neuter instead of feminine/masculine/neuter
[2:38:28] <hntronium> @HeavyC4 He is father to all of us
[2:38:33] <arkv01> father I must grow bigger
[2:38:33] <Worldbrand> father woolie, who decries the evils of premarital sex
[2:38:35] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus taunt while using punchline, it's sooooo BADASS
[2:38:36] <joylent_blue> monkaS
[2:38:37] <Xisalex> @WoolieVersus you can spin different direction during a jump on punchline using the L-stick
[2:38:37] <HeavyC4> hey does using punch line makes it explode if you ride it too much?
[2:38:39] <%UrsulaCat> @nobknee punchmom corrected him
[2:38:40] <+Vivaciousx3> @WoolieVersus i can link a video for punchline tech
[2:38:45] <CerberusDriver> Jump on the horse statues head if you haven't, you can also make it onto that big bridge where the Hell Cainas show up
[2:38:46] <AlasterAngelo> @HeavyC4 yeah
[2:38:58] <SpiritLegion> This looks like it runs about the same speed as DMC4 turbo
[2:39:00] <AlasterAngelo> @HeavyC4 you can combo off the explosion or just jump off to stop it though
[2:39:02] <HeavyC4> god Nero air taunt is so godlike. IT A SECOND double jump that can be used multiple times in the air. PogChamp
[2:39:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @WoolieVersus Taunt when using punchline apparently?
[2:39:05] <konami2010> yeah jump from horse statue to the bridge with a taunt
[2:39:08] <SpiritLegion> turbo mode in this would be SICK

[2:43:21] <%UrsulaCat> @BlitzChocula that makes me think of tbfp too much ;_;
[2:43:27] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus that's just a guess
[2:43:33] <SpiritLegion> you can do the same to test callibur cancels
[2:43:37] <HeavyC4> @Youwereeatenbyalid it got buff a bit by actually doing damage and hitstun but STILL
[2:43:37] <C_Sixty_Jam> Did you know that Nero while surfing the rocket arm if you do too many attacks you can spin out of control and Nero eats shit hard for style points LUL

[2:46:56] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus there's an official screenshot with a bigger arms magazine, around 8
[2:46:56] <$Thepenguinking1> what is your favorite arm so far??
[2:47:05] <%Chichen> LUL
[2:47:07] <C_Sixty_Jam> Rare name?
[2:47:08] <joylent_blue> lol
[2:47:09] <%Ariksgabs> LUL
[2:47:13] <DarkKnightGrave> LUL
[2:47:16] <SpiritLegion> @terminallyCapriciousz I mean he did get it chopped off in this game, so its definitely new to him
[2:47:18] <CerberusDriver> @terminallyCapriciousz he had a demonic arm in the last game but at the start of this one, it gets ripped off
[2:47:19] <%DedlokPM> @terminallyCapriciousz His Devil Arm was taken off so the "new arm" is the metal arm
[2:47:26] <gnarly_memes_bro> my name is stinky poo poo
[2:47:31] <ivansonic08> Because you only have one arm
[2:47:31] <DSD24> They thought about it
[2:47:31] <DarkKnightGrave> Arise Chichen
[2:47:32] <Kalcom> dead
[2:47:34] <thesw1tch> lakers. them laaaaakaaaahhhsss
[2:47:36] <%Chichen> I am risen
[2:47:39] <LeeBastienOfficial> Buster Keaton Nero
[2:47:45] <BigNerdSam> Winner winner @chichen dinner
[2:47:46] <+tiishi> so has woolie got an s yet lol
[2:47:47] <DrkJP520> Man, what a loser. Only has one arm
[2:47:48] <mostundesired> Slightly lame, I should be able to rev my sword while shooting a gun.
[2:47:50] <+Risingxiv> there is a wallpaper with 8 arms on it
[2:48:06] <%UrsulaCat> one arm doing one thing the other arm doing another thing?
[2:48:12] <thesw1tch> woolie doing way better than pat
[2:48:12] <gunzerkingdunce> every art from DMC is a wallpaper
[2:48:13] <Shooterboy23> @mostundesired thats like rubbing your belling while scratching your head shit
[2:48:14] <joylent_blue> what a loser, had his arm ripped off 4Head guy who did it was probably a loser too 4Head
[2:48:19] <HeavyC4> I hope nero get more red queen combos in the air
[2:48:22] <gunzerkingdunce> its like kh in that regard
[2:48:23] <+Morning_Asakura> how does one reload and rev a sword at the same time
[2:48:31] <mostundesired> @Shooterboy23 Perhaps, but it's also badass and that's what matters here.
[2:48:35] <+AhmCha> Pleasantly surprised by the PS4 performance. It's smooth even on the base PS4
[2:48:40] <AlasterAngelo> STOP BUZZING AROUND
[2:48:41] <TheFilth> the breaker for it is very tasty
[2:48:42] <+sirminj> SS
[2:48:43] <Vashido22> punch line is my favourite devil breaker so far
[2:48:44] <%UrsulaCat> S RANK HERO
[2:48:45] <gnarly_memes_bro> seek skeels
[2:48:46] <Vashido22> its great
[2:49:00] <HeavyC4> @Morning_Asakura rev with one arm and do that stylish relord that nero did in DMC4 fight against dante 1 with the other hand.
[2:49:04] <%BlitzChocula> its going to be a great fiscal year end for Capcom.
[2:49:05] <joylent_blue> the 3 punchlines hanging off his hip look funny
[2:49:07] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> Ok so basic Punchline is just a round-trip right? Is the skating the charged version?
[2:49:20] <gunzerkingdunce> @woolieversus just riding the arm into goliath while he's stunned just does alot of tick damage
[2:49:27] <%UrsulaCat> c rank..
[2:49:34] <mostundesired> Man, where did Daimon's wings go?
[2:49:35] <Xisalex> @WoolieVersus give me link priviledges and I'll show you how it's done!
[2:49:45] <joylent_blue> SkewerSTARSTREAM you hold circle as it comes back to you, the charged move is a shoryuken type move
[2:49:49] <+AhmCha> HELL YEAH
[2:49:50] <%mikeiskill> what'd woolie have to say about the V gameplay that came out?
[2:49:53] <Vashido22> that feels SO GOOD
[2:49:58] <+skizzuto> wait can you do the shoryu in the air?
[2:50:01] <gunzerkingdunce> God the flip
[2:50:04] <+krispen_wa> Almost Real Impact
[2:50:04] <+AhmCha> I thought V was gonna be playable in this demo
[2:50:10] <Vashido22> @skizzuto It goes down
[2:50:12] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> Ok. I saw it!
[2:50:12] <+krispen_wa> Slightly Fake Impact
[2:50:16] <DrowsyLouis> this the new dmc? PogChamp
[2:50:17] <+skizzuto> ah ok
[2:50:18] <+FlubbedPig> Has he tried to use Punch Line's charge punch in the air yet?
[2:50:19] <%terminallyCapriciousz> people thought dante would be playable too
[2:50:20] <%BlitzChocula> glow noodle.
[2:50:23] <joylent_blue> nice LUL
[2:50:25] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @DrowsyLouis nah it's the new Warcraft game
[2:50:26] <spardanwarrior> Laser right up the pooper
[2:50:28] <konami2010> was that no damage?
[2:50:32] <gnarly_memes_bro> @DrowsyLouis is the demo
[2:50:40] <HeavyC4> @FlubbedPig it the ground pound move dante thoes
[2:50:40] <Xisalex> @WoolieVersus wanna see some of my experimentation?

[2:51:01] <DrowsyLouis> @terminallycapriciousz, @gnarly_memes_bro :) 7
[2:51:03] <Mornaka> @WoolieVersus have you used the punch line charge in the air?
[2:51:04] <DSD24> I feel like they could do it though
[2:51:04] <HeavyC4> GIVE NERO HIS DT BACK
[2:51:04] <Vashido22> MAH DICK
[2:51:05] <Shooterboy23> This being the better demo is capcom throwing a huge "FUCK YOU" to exclusivity in the most subtle way
[2:51:07] <SpiritLegion> Nero's song says pull my DT
[2:51:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I didn't get an S rank until I got like 13000 orbs
[2:51:11] <+Morning_Asakura> that's too much work
[2:51:13] <+tiishi> !uptime
[2:51:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 51 minutes
[2:51:16] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus i don't expect it, i also don't hate it
[2:51:16] <joylent_blue> dude Dante has too much by that standard
[2:51:17] <startstoprepeat> so you're saying, if they did that, it'd be exceeding your expectations?
[2:51:18] <+Morning_Asakura> even for itsuno
[2:51:20] <%mikeiskill> sooo....DMC4 Dante too much?
[2:51:20] <SpiritLegion> i'll riot if they dont give him DT
[2:51:21] <HeavyC4> @Morning_Asakura THAT THE TALK FOR THE WEAK
[2:51:25] <+SirG005E> dont expect it? prepare to have that expectation exceeded
[2:51:26] <DaringOcelot> i dont know, i think Devil Trigger as a song just foreshadows nero getting DT back
[2:51:27] <TheFilth> No DT for the guy with Devil Trigger
[2:51:28] <DSD24> I feel like its possible
[2:51:29] <ScreamingMeat> @WoolieVersus I do expect us to get the Devilbringer back and that'll be awesome and we'll get a new DT
[2:51:31] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus i don't expect it, i also don't hate the idea
[2:51:32] <gunzerkingdunce> Maybe? there's 8 confirmed arms right? Only 8 maybe
[2:51:37] <ivansonic08> Rev ACT 5
[2:51:37] <+sirminj> no new playable charaters?
[2:51:38] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Imagine getting trigger, and timing three shots and a trigger activation with "BANG BANG BANG, PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER"
[2:51:39] <HeavyC4> maybe DLC for hte future
[2:51:41] <+Morning_Asakura> I WILL STAY !MOTIVATED
[2:51:45] <DSD24> @gunzerkingdunce There is those DLC arms too
[2:51:45] <gnarly_memes_bro> i dont think that would happen but the idea of gerbera DT gets me wet

[2:52:07] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus i don't expect it, i also don't hate the idea
[2:52:07] <DSD24> Imagine DT changes look based on which arm you have on
[2:52:10] <Kenny_Riot> Woolie, Big ups on the ZOE2 playthrough

[3:09:55] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> I'ld love to play this game. but Origin... NotLikeThis
[3:09:59] <+Griffin1171> BR games usually don't have music
[3:09:59] <SkeletalApostle> This seems like one of the better BR's so far, design wise
[3:10:02] <blink289> @applefibs sounds right
[3:10:12] <DraxTD> @akuda_bar ah, I must of been half asleep in the podcast.... though what's the diffrence?
[3:10:13] <stranger59> I'll try it on console, just so I can avoid Origin.
[3:10:15] <Xenodile> Oh that's some Borderlands chest/item tech right the fuck there
[3:10:17] <%imextremelymanly> no controller and mouse hybrid?
[3:10:18] <Xisalex> this looks kinda neat.
[3:10:19] <crimsonharvest> alright fam load up your dabs and fire up the bubbler
[3:10:19] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus so what system is the plan for the TF2 stream? Ps4, origin,...xbone?
[3:10:22] <%UnderpaidBob> i loved the alternator in TF2
[3:10:23] <@akuda_bar> @DraxTD one's a warframe, one's a BR
[3:10:24] <ArtThouBored> Thank EA for this music guys
[3:10:24] <+Morning_Asakura> more shooting
[3:10:25] <Mrbaconator> do the shot good
[3:10:26] <+Griffin1171> I'm guessing this is less focused on stealth
[3:10:28] <Xisalex> still mad it's not Titanfall.
[3:10:29] <Mrbaconator> don't do the shoot bad
[3:10:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Just got back from dinner and we went from devil triggers to chicken dinners I see
[3:10:29] <+applefibs> alternator is supposedly really weak in tihs game
[3:10:29] <TigerClaws12> will we get woolie to pick up the mouse tho nathanThinking
[3:10:34] <+realtraplord> I missed hi playing the dmc5 demo did he like it
[3:10:37] <+realtraplord> Him
[3:10:40] <%Skullgod> Woolie, aim your reticle higher you have it slightly lowered on the ground so its harder to react
[3:10:43] <+muteik777> That landing made me sad.
[3:10:43] <DraxTD> @akuda_bar ah, all FPS look the same brown to me
[3:10:45] <dero45> Your bad and u should feel bad
[3:10:45] <CrossWordPuzzle> Can you run on walls in apex?
[3:10:49] <RubeensVinicius> Is woolie playing on PC?
[3:10:50] <+muteik777> you can slide on landing right?
[3:10:51] <majindusto> No
[3:10:51] <Cthulos> Missing movement hard
[3:10:52] <Fujiwara_92> @woolieversus half of us wouldn't play better than you so don't worry about being bad

[3:10:54] <Josef_Stryker> No u can't :(

[3:19:13] <nepwar> bots finally got him
[3:19:14] <%JJCheeker> f
[3:19:14] <bevyrage> so woolie, you shouldn't hold onto mods with the cancel sign on them. it means neither of your weapons can equip 'em
[3:19:17] <PsychoFlash1> perhaps you should play with a keyboard/mouse, woolie
[3:19:18] <xiccy> Turn on streamer mode
[3:19:18] <Fujiwara_92> KILLED BY A HOT
[3:19:19] <mrpandabear437> you have to aim down sights if you want to hit someone oolie
[3:19:19] <CerberusDriver> Has anyone heard the Devil Trigger/Love Shack mash up
[3:19:20] <SaltyDongs> A big number
[3:19:23] <Fujiwara_92> I mean bot
[3:19:23] <ebonifragaria> 3
[3:19:24] <BigNerdSam> Even as a pad player, seeing @woolieversus aim is saddening. Use aim (LT) to snap onto enemies.
[3:19:26] <@mothmandraws> 7 squads left
[3:19:29] <@mothmandraws> woolie is gonna win
[3:19:32] <stranger59> Should change your name to your social. Wait, do Canadians have socials?
[3:19:36] <%imextremelymanly> its not over yet
[3:19:38] <nobknee> @CerberusDriver I would very much like to hear that.
[3:19:40] <+saltpiggu> So is woolie enjoying the game?
[3:19:45] <dero45> Nothing is oveeeer
[3:19:48] <@akuda_bar> @saltpiggu debatable
[3:19:51] <+Bustamente> People quit ALOT after they die, i've revived like 3 teamates only to realize they quit @WoolieVersus

[3:19:54] <+bonzosan> use your yomi woolie
[3:19:55] <+blastazoid26> @WoolieVersus Turn streamer mode in the settings.

[3:20:04] <%imextremelymanly> but you are so good at fighting games. you should be good at reading minds
[3:20:05] <CalderGaming> @WoolieVersus inquiring chat wants to know: why not play this on console if you're using pad anyway
[3:20:06] <CAPSLOCKlive> Now just imagine if someone were to apply the Gundam Breaker mold to a Battle Royale game........
[3:20:12] <CerberusDriver> Just look up Love Shack Trigger - Devil May Cry vs the B-52's for the mash up.
[3:20:15] <DrkJP520> Is there a point in sticking around if you've killed?
[3:20:22] <EnviTheFool> His Banner Icon is providing the vital moral support

[3:24:20] <%terminallyCapriciousz> this is titanfall 7
[3:24:20] <Dalkalopagus> You could cover up the map in obs/xsplit if you wanna be safe but it's not that big a deal

[3:33:36] <Daiidalus> 😭 I miss B Hopping already
[3:33:38] <CalderGaming> use the spot macros instead of talking, it's fiiiiiine
[3:33:39] <+BlueBardTiefling> Just a heads up to everyone, the Monster Hunter World X The Witcher collab is live
[3:33:46] <+Aeoneth> Chat has woolie won one yet
[3:33:50] <+RadiatedImp> @pillowwasp alternatively, imagine if this game was cancelled
[3:33:53] <+VanaSkiller> LUL
[3:33:56] <@mothmandraws> angriest pat finally a sub
[3:33:58] <DSD24> oof
[3:33:59] <nepwar> OH MAN that hurt so much
[3:34:01] <+SirG005E> take that pat
[3:34:02] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Pat is now SUBBED to woolie for the first time
[3:34:02] <+chaos5338> LUL
[3:34:03] <ebonifragaria> 1
[3:34:04] <+Rossco1337> putting your gun away lets you jump higher
[3:34:04] <Madbearv> 3/10 its not warframe
[3:34:05] <pillowwasp> @radiatedimp the dream
[3:34:05] <%imextremelymanly> nope he died to the first team he saw
[3:34:05] <+applefibs> @Aeoneth he hasn't even shot anyone yet
[3:34:06] <%Ariksgabs> Wait what?!?!
[3:34:09] <Midnight_Crest> u can hold the button to vault btw LUL
[3:34:10] <Stone_free_wolf> Can I call ups to be on your team next match? 👀
[3:34:11] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[3:34:11] <+Irridium> I know that fucking feel I do it all the damn time
[3:34:13] <%Ariksgabs> Pat's not a Sub? LUL
[3:34:15] <Zebroneath> Pat now #1 fan.
[3:34:18] <+LogothX> Cant wait for the titanfall 2 stream
[3:34:19] <MegaFangKing23> I wonder how this game will do in the coming weeks.
[3:34:20] <+RadiatedImp> @pillowwasp Did not get the joke LUL
[3:34:20] <mayorrev> PAT WASN'T SUBBED
[3:34:22] <%UrsulaCat> @WoolieVersus hi woolie glance at me
[3:34:23] <Ordinaryknight> @bluebardtiefling Thanks for the update! What's the weapon for the event?
[3:34:24] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus tip. HOLD jump and you’ll climb over walls
[3:34:27] <cx_c2> Pat FeelsWeirdMan
[3:34:34] <reonome> pat isn't even subbed to paige
[3:34:37] <+Andrizzleton> wait, is this Woolz's first BR game?
[3:34:37] <+Chitoman4> NICE
[3:34:44] <+SirG005E> and I PULL OUT MY GUUUUN
[3:34:45] <nepwar> pats doesn't follow redbull and doesnt sub to woolz. what a heel that guy
[3:34:47] <MegaFangKing23> @reonome Damn. :(
[3:34:50] <DSD24> @Andrizzleton Nah he played PUBG before
[3:34:51] <pillowwasp> @radiatedimp I know titanfall 3 was cancelled
[3:34:55] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus Drop your energy ammo, it justs watses space
[3:34:58] <dero45> I expect good things for this game seeing how I hated all BR until this game out
[3:34:59] <%Ariksgabs> saving his money for redbulls and microtransactions I guess
[3:35:00] <%UrsulaCat> @mothmandraws pat was always a sub
[3:35:02] <Zebroneath> Woolie has played PUBG on SBFP before.
[3:35:04] <reonome> its ok paige isn't subbed to pat either
[3:35:04] <Madbearv> this doesn't look great tbh
[3:35:06] <+dickbuttwoman> How long has he been playing? Get into any firefights yet?
[3:35:13] <yhcoult> follow a YHCoult
[3:35:17] <@mothmandraws> Im not subbed to any
[3:35:19] <+RadiatedImp> @pillowwasp I'm saying if it had those things it would have been cancelled LUL
[3:35:20] <+BlueBardTiefling> @Ordinaryknight Geralt's sword seems to a charge blade and Ciri's are dual blades
[3:35:22] <%terminallyCapriciousz> second match, he's been in one fire fight
[3:35:23] <Sedrelic> why subbing to friends and girlfriend if you could buy some redbull
[3:35:23] <@mothmandraws> mine was a generous gift
[3:35:23] <MegaFangKing23> @dero45 I feel that too. Played with a few friends today and had some fun.
[3:35:26] <%terminallyCapriciousz> died immediately
[3:35:30] <+rooked4> Imagine if this was a wrestling battle royal game
[3:35:31] <pillowwasp> @radiatedimp fair enough
[3:35:35] <+blastazoid26> drop bullets and attachments you dont need
[3:35:35] <+Clik404> I do like this game, but I know I’m not enjoying it nearly as much as I would enjoy TF3
[3:35:38] <+Idziman> o shit, Titanfall Kappa
[3:35:40] <%imextremelymanly> just another ten minute until someone starts shooting
[3:35:45] <MegaFangKing23> @dero45 Can't really do the Fortnites.
[3:35:51] <@mothmandraws> he was a good old widowmaker
[3:35:53] <+Clik404> which is a shitty feeling
[3:36:00] <%imextremelymanly> black gift was good
[3:36:04] <+BlueBardTiefling> @Ordinaryknight also two new humanoid monsters
[3:36:05] <Ordinaryknight> @bluebardtiefling Dang was hoping for some Longsword love. Thanks though
[3:36:06] <%UrsulaCat> I wanna play healer
[3:36:08] <%riantDeliration> huh
[3:36:10] <MegaFangKing23> WutFace
[3:36:12] <nepwar> yeyeyeye
[3:36:15] <nobknee> This kinda looks like Planetside 2 sometimes.
[3:36:18] <dero45> @megafangking23 I brought into fortnite when it was a zombie game rip save the world
[3:36:25] <NinjaGentleman> I wanna play tracer
[3:36:28] <Madbearv> I wish it had things like
[3:36:30] <Madbearv> mecha
[3:36:31] <SaltyDongs> dinosaur king is what you wanna be yeah

[3:36:42] <SchlongKongEduardo> is he playing with randoms
[3:36:42] <Mirakei> Race traitor Woolie showing his true colours by playing this game.
[3:36:43] <+stephane3012> nier automata
[3:36:45] <@mothmandraws> 9 squads left
[3:36:45] <MegaFangKing23> @dero45 My friend did the same. RIP indeed
[3:36:47] <@mothmandraws> they gonna make it
[3:36:49] <thesw1tch> why is EA sacrificing both Anthem and this game? mafuckers can't help but compete with themselves
[3:36:51] <Zebroneath> MAAAAAAAN......I wish Titnfall had a moment someday where you fight dinosaurs with Titans.
[3:36:54] <extradopeness> I'll take Winston
[3:36:59] <+rooked4> Thats not the Wraith that I know and love
[3:37:03] <nobknee> Anthem was always gonna blow.
[3:37:04] <@mothmandraws> tfw apex kills anthem
[3:37:11] <AncelDeLambert> oh god, it's like Borderlands but Roguelike
[3:37:12] <%riantDeliration> yikes thats 50% volume?
[3:37:14] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Jurassic Fall: Newest Titanfall title
[3:37:17] <AncelDeLambert> thats the fucking WORST
[3:37:18] <@mothmandraws> nah in game chat
[3:37:22] <+Clik404> Please tell me they’ll add in some titanfall shit after a few months
[3:37:23] <SchlongKongEduardo> WutFace
[3:37:25] <ebonifragaria> D:
[3:37:30] <%Ariksgabs> I like how Woolie seems to enjoy this more than Anthem
[3:37:31] <Ultimatefool> The enemies are shooting at me :)

[3:37:40] <+PBandJensen> And here you are, spending time with the murderer! lol
[3:37:40] <BinaryShuffle> F
[3:37:41] <sultanjaber> Woolie I thought you wanted to spend time with your baby not it’s killer
[3:37:41] <dashwalrus> yea, thats how it is the first few games, dont worry woolie
[3:37:42] <Madbearv> now tbag him
[3:37:42] <pillowwasp> Just add a character that calls a mech
[3:37:42] <+mechslayer71> @anceldelambert I don’t think you know what that term actually means...
[3:37:44] <bigbradish> Ooof
[3:37:45] <%GarbageNirvana> You think that guy likes bloodhound or something
[3:37:48] <dero45> Protect your gotdamn neck
[3:37:48] <AncelDeLambert> yes I do
[3:37:48] <NinjaGentleman> You can still respawn DendiFace
[3:37:49] <Xisalex> better yet, jump over the wall like he id.
[3:37:54] <%imextremelymanly> F sorry man
[3:37:54] <NoirePanzer> WEAK NECK
[3:37:54] <AncelDeLambert> you die and it resets
[3:37:54] <+chaos5338> f
[3:37:55] <nepwar> pacifist run still going strong
[3:37:57] <RantingRavager> perhaps using a mouse and keyboard would help
[3:37:57] <crononinja> DID SENPAI ACKNOWLEDGE ME
[3:38:02] <+Shotgundam009> you'll get used to it
[3:38:03] <MegaFangKing23> Check those corners!
[3:38:07] <@mothmandraws> thyhy gonna carry
[3:38:09] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus You still fuck with OverWatch?
[3:38:09] <+litttdriftkid42> if your not full can i join you after this game
[3:38:10] <C_Sixty_Jam> @WoolieVersus Just think of it as footsies
[3:38:12] <+mechslayer71> @anceldelambert This is a battle royale
[3:38:16] <Madbearv> ya gotta be on a swivel
[3:38:17] <SchlongKongEduardo> L is for Learning
[3:38:21] <nepwar> he diddd it
[3:38:21] <funkieboy> pathfinder's innocent attitude is so perfect for woolie in this game
[3:38:21] <+blastazoid26> All of woolie's stat points go to fighting games
[3:38:30] <+JohnnyRocketStreams> @crononinja i acknowledge you friend
[3:38:34] <@mothmandraws> cant believe woolie is carrying skullgod liek this
[3:38:35] <C_Sixty_Jam> moon2POGGYWOGGY Champion eliminated
[3:38:37] <krymzen5> does he like it?
[3:38:39] <+Snakeofdeath91> You doing this on ps4 woolie
[3:38:44] <krymzen5> i think its p fun
[3:38:47] <Zebroneath> Yeah, Max commented on the BLOPS4 BR that a sense of awareness is pretty much key.
[3:38:47] <%GarbageNirvana> My stats are all over the place
[3:38:48] <Ognjenco> so @WoolieVersus what are the thoughts on the game so far?
[3:38:49] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus no offense to you. Its kinda interesting seeing the opposite effect for me with fighting games. im starting to get them down. But it was rough at first, local meetups made it easier
[3:38:49] <gunstar73> We screamlording now
[3:38:52] <NinjaGentleman> no he's using controller on pc @Snakeofdeath91
[3:38:53] <%UrsulaCat> *sees a fighting game* haha cool woolie reference
[3:38:55] <ebonifragaria> Outside is like Elder Scrolls
[3:38:55] <exileshadow03> Yo Woolz, if you're interested in M&K controls try looking into the Razer Turret. Unless controller is just more comfortable for ya, in which case, rock on!
[3:38:57] <+mechslayer71> @snakeofdeath91 He’s playing on PC with a controller
[3:38:57] <MegaFangKing23> Same.
[3:38:59] <Madbearv> Woolie is on the oblivion system I see
[3:39:01] <crononinja> @JohnnyRocketStreams THANKS MAN FEELS GOOD TOP BE WANTED FOR ONCE
[3:39:07] <%Ariksgabs> I never distributed my points to any genre
[3:39:07] <+KnightsoftheOnion> i think its cool you're giving this a shot, have fun dude!
[3:39:07] <+Cook_4_Souls> hey
[3:39:10] <+VanaSkiller> tru
[3:39:14] <BinaryShuffle> wait, you can respawn?
[3:39:14] <%ssjklyco> FPS are just Fighting Games with Guns instead of fist. Think about it
[3:39:16] <Madbearv> 'how do I get good'
[3:39:18] <dero45> How do I combo
[3:39:23] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Man I must have had a low number of stat points. Spent 10 years playing MMOs but I'm still bad LUL
[3:39:23] <+bonzosan> Woolie should write a book.
[3:39:25] <%imextremelymanly> do combo
[3:39:26] <+blastazoid26> couldnt have said it better myself
[3:39:26] <%ZaibatsuFan> I bet SonicFox is a TERRIBLE tap-dancer.
[3:39:26] <Madbearv> the same way you get good at anything
[3:39:28] <+VanaSkiller> How Do Combo
[3:39:29] <Clyderso> Just do combo
[3:39:30] <+LogothX> Gotta find another G U N
[3:39:30] <ShinobiPhoenix> my Stat build went to RPG's and Card Games
[3:39:35] <Madbearv> hours of practice
[3:39:50] <@mothmandraws> run woolie
[3:39:51] <SnaKemuho> but using pad on PC is a serious handicap
[3:39:52] <nepwar> how do combo? answer: get your shit pushed for a decade
[3:39:54] <+EastwindGuru> Is Woolie enjoying Not Titanfall?
[3:39:54] <%riantDeliration> this game really loves spawning G7 Scouts
[3:39:55] <+RushUnplugged> just do combo but with bullet
[3:39:58] <ebonifragaria> Someone map out a giant skill tree for life
[3:39:58] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:39:59] <ECRead> i have 300 hours logged on L4D2 and that's the only shooter i can play well now (that isn't Warframe)
[3:40:00] <+Snakeofdeath91> How can i donate to the stream?
[3:40:02] <+Silentman0> the biggest thing is that it's not like fighting games where controller doesn't matter, if you're going to play with a controller you should play on console where everyone else uses it too
[3:40:03] <%UrsulaCat> woolie please win
[3:40:05] <+VanaSkiller> @nepwar woopsLUL

[3:40:21] <+BlueBardTiefling> @Ordinaryknight Correction, geralt's is a sword and sheild
[3:40:22] <+applefibs> do people play fighting games with a keyboard?
[3:40:23] <@mothmandraws> loot faster wools
[3:40:26] <+dickbuttwoman> Those barrel stablizers are worth their weight in gold
[3:40:28] <ShadowSketches> playing on controller, ew
[3:40:34] <%imextremelymanly> you can't get that good unless you use the necessary equipment... use your mouse man
[3:40:38] <+blastazoid26> People play fighting games with a wheel
[3:40:47] <%DedlokPM> Loot your own dead body Woolie. sbfpYeyeye
[3:40:48] <%ssjklyco> This game almost looks like Borderlands with a toned down cel shading look for some reason
[3:40:49] <%ZaibatsuFan> That's the dance of his people.
[3:40:54] <+Mikatonic> @ShadowSketches isn't he on ps4?
[3:40:55] <MegaFangKing23> LOOT SMOrc
[3:40:55] <+dickbuttwoman> Backpack woolz
[3:40:59] <crononinja> IS MAYONAISE A FAIGHTING GAME?
[3:40:59] <%Eaglestrike117> BACKPACK
[3:41:02] <NinjaGentleman> He out here doing bonetrousle
[3:41:02] <+Aeoneth> Woolie take the blue backpack
[3:41:04] <+blastazoid26> backpack
[3:41:05] <%riantDeliration> just skimming right past the good loot, god bless you woolie
[3:41:08] <+EastwindGuru> Woolie get the bak..........
[3:41:09] <+dickbuttwoman> lol
[3:41:09] <ShadowSketches> well the B looks like an xbox promp
[3:41:09] <%terminallyCapriciousz> woolie continuing to take things he can't use but not the backpack
[3:41:12] <+EastwindGuru> nvm.
[3:41:15] <gunstar73> He doesn’t know chat
[3:41:16] <+LogothX> Playing an FPS with a controller is like trying to play a Street Fighter 2 with an OG genesis controller
[3:41:17] <+RadiatedImp> gold on table
[3:41:19] <Sedrelic> a legend is just bootleg mordecai
[3:41:21] <nepwar> in hindsight, putting stats in Halo CE and 2 was not the smartest of choices
[3:41:21] <ShadowSketches> so unless ps4 started allowing xbox support lol
[3:41:22] <+Clik404> did you notice that the IMC and militia conflict is just over now? and apparently it ended peacefully?
[3:41:27] <Ordinaryknight> @bluebardtiefling Ok, Now I'm Modivated. SH is my second weapon, cool!
[3:41:43] <+Clik404> after the literal planet destruction in Titanfall 2?
[3:41:45] <alwayspronking> Its fine. Now is learn time

[3:41:49] <%RioGascar> Remember guys. WE DONT UNDERSTAND FIGHTING GAME FUNDAMENTALS. But woolie doesnt get things that we consider standard
[3:41:50] <Madbearv> Didn't this just come out
[3:41:51] <%Ariksgabs> It's fin
[3:41:51] <%GarbageNirvana> @Clik404 Yeah, and apparently the Apex Predators set this up because they were bored
[3:41:52] <ShadowSketches> woolie, just take everything you can pick up until you cant pick up anymore
[3:41:53] <@akuda_bar> !motivated
[3:41:53] <@Moobot> 30 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!

[3:42:06] <CAPSLOCKlive> Play to learn and get !motivated =) you doing ooooookay

[3:42:09] <%riantDeliration> portals cool :)
[3:42:10] <+RadiatedImp> !motivated
[3:42:11] <%imextremelymanly> we expected this
[3:42:18] <Dawnchaser_Twitch> @WoolieVersus You learn by making mistakes, why can't people not understand that.
[3:42:19] <@mothmandraws> woolie in a warzone
[3:42:19] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Woolie Figures it out
[3:42:21] <@akuda_bar> @UrsulaCat i am dangerously motivated

[3:42:27] <Madbearv> I wish they could have done something more with the enviroments
[3:42:31] <+VanaSkiller> fighting game instincts kicked in LUL
[3:42:33] <+blastazoid26> @WoolieVersus You can check your inventory and if you see a red circle on an item, you can probably throw it away.
[3:42:34] <gnarly_memes_bro> 10/10
[3:42:34] <%UrsulaCat> SHE CANNOT BE STOPPED
[3:42:34] <extradopeness> Arf

[3:42:39] <PlainSimpleTailor> Is Woolz playing an FPS on CONSOLE?
[3:42:41] <+mechslayer71> @reiju_22 Cuz he like pain. Did you hear what he said to his fiancée earlier?
[3:42:42] <%LowEnergyStarman> Portals are fun - Woolie, 2019
[3:42:42] <Zebroneath> Got a good haymaker in there.
[3:42:43] <mrpandabear437> better than last time, you did damage
[3:42:44] <+Aeoneth> Good try Woolie
[3:42:45] <%UnderpaidBob> he got some good hits in
[3:42:46] <thelovingfool> point, aim, shoot
[3:42:47] <randomness_yo> should have shot first b4 bashing lol
[3:42:47] <Worldbrand> If you can't out-execute them, try to out-tactic them
[3:42:48] <MegaFangKing23> I know the feeling Woolie.
[3:42:48] <+RadiatedImp> die and learn
[3:42:49] <ShadowSketches> he tried to do the low punch when he should have just used super
[3:42:50] <CaptCynical> every L is a lesson
[3:42:51] <+EastwindGuru> How does Woolie feel about the Caribbean healer waifu?
[3:42:51] <gunstar73> You got some hits in tho
[3:42:52] <%GarbageNirvana> 6/20 ain't bad
[3:42:52] <+skizzuto> damage dealt 30
[3:42:53] <CAPSLOCKlive> Play to Learn =)
[3:42:56] <@mothmandraws> I blame skull for that honestly
[3:42:58] <+Clik404> @garbagenirvana it honestly makes me worried about the future of this franchise, like, will there be any more entries in it outside of Apex legends?
[3:43:01] <GamerGoat007> out of the pot and into the fire :)
[3:43:02] <%terminallyCapriciousz> play to win
[3:43:05] <%Skullgod> fuck you moth
[3:43:06] <NinjaGentleman> @WoolieVersus no skull was just talking in game chat
[3:43:06] <Madbearv> if you aren't having fun then what's the point
[3:43:06] <%Ariksgabs> well at least you're facing the enemy this time
[3:43:10] <Fironial> 30 damage better than zero
[3:43:13] <+Snakeofdeath91> Are you going to play on ps4 and how do i donate to the stream
[3:43:18] <Stone_free_wolf> one of the most important things to do when playing a battle royal is to go towards engagement so you can learn
[3:43:18] <SchlongKongEduardo> a light punch
[3:43:21] <%GarbageNirvana> @Clik404 Probably depends on how well this does, which from the sounds of things ain't too bad so far
[3:43:23] <foreverN2dust> Why not play with Minh?
[3:43:28] <umbypokochan> is this Overfall of Duty Legends?
[3:43:28] <%imextremelymanly> better than your last game. getting better
[3:43:30] <+VanaSkiller> melee only
[3:43:33] <+demon1103> its kinda nice seeing someone on my level and not someone with 200+ kills
[3:43:38] <+EastwindGuru> 6 out of 20 aint bad at all.
[3:43:40] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus heres a way to feel better. You’ll be able to understand a new fighting game within 2 hours of playing it. while our dumbasses flounder for 2 weeks and quit
[3:43:41] <+blastazoid26> Your stats will get BIG someday Woolz
[3:43:45] <DomunDomunDomun> Isn't Minh playing on PS4?
[3:43:45] <foreverN2dust> Playing on PC?
[3:43:47] <reiju_22> @woolieversus why not play on ps4?
[3:43:48] <%Ariksgabs> It can only go up from here :)
[3:43:48] <nepwar> at least woolz has the good mindset of engaging and not avoiding every fight he sees
[3:43:49] <MegaFangKing23> The more you play the more you'll learn. It's okay. :)
[3:43:50] <Buttku> just got in, does he like it?
[3:43:57] <+Clik404> @garbagenirvana though, doing too well might mean that they don’t end up pushing for a risky new non-BR game
[3:43:58] <foreverN2dust> @DomunDomunDomun yeah
[3:44:04] <%ssjklyco> The stream isn't streamlined for that sort of advance audio tech
[3:44:08] <+Louie_Salmon> Woolie, you should really go back in time and play 10,000 hours of shooters instead of fighting games, that's all it would take for you would be ready to play apex legend.
[3:44:08] <MegaFangKing23> @Buttku Not sure. I just got in to.
[3:44:09] <+EastwindGuru> I can't tell, but i don't think he hates it?
[3:44:11] <+Ecchigun> @WoolieVersus should we just talke ingame ?
[3:44:18] <MegaFangKing23> DOES Woolie like this game so far?
[3:44:24] <CalderGaming> that's what i was afraid the answer was
[3:44:25] <zamzoph> I just got here. Is Woolie having fun with the hottest new video game that killed Titanfall forever? PogChamp
[3:44:30] <+Snakeofdeath91> how do i donate to the stream
[3:44:31] <%Eaglestrike117> It'd probably be better to just yell at him with Ingame voice
[3:44:34] <+EastwindGuru> It's a polished BR for sure but its still a BR.
[3:44:35] <ebonifragaria> つ ◕_◕ ༽つ only positivity for dearest Woolie
[3:44:36] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus do you have experience with any FPS other than Titanfall? I used to think I would hate them, but I like BioShock and Borderlands, and then played some Destiny. You'll find your "home".
[3:44:37] <Ordinaryknight> So this uses TF guns? Is the wide beam shotgun thing in it?
[3:44:38] <$Retrash> even the best controller players will struggle against average M&KB players
[3:44:41] <MegaFangKing23> I thought Origin was terrible?
[3:44:43] <+Ecchigun> WOW
[3:44:46] <%Eaglestrike117> Snake its the link down below
[3:44:47] <+Ecchigun> he got a skin for my waifu
[3:44:47] <ShadowSketches> dang, i want that wraith skin
[3:44:57] <%UrsulaCat> @WoolieVersus don't be so mean to yourself! when you do that you're shit talking my favorite youtuber
[3:45:02] <+Shotgundam009> "serious" players MiniK
[3:45:02] <+lag2993> no arma is were serious people go to play fps
[3:45:03] <%ZaibatsuFan> Plz tell me Woolie just got super rare skins
[3:45:03] <+mechslayer71> God, when is Bayo 3 gonna get a release date?
[3:45:05] <+blastazoid26> @WoolieVersus You can check your inventory for red circled items that you can throw away.
[3:45:06] <%GarbageNirvana> @Clik404 Maybe it'll do so well Respawn will buy the license off of EA and break out on their own like Bungie. Either way I'm glad the dev team's still getting to do work
[3:45:07] <%Ariksgabs> Lootboxes Kreygasm
[3:45:09] <%Skullgod> Woolie you can just talk in game chat
[3:45:09] <Worldbrand> because you use a controller though
[3:45:10] <ShadowSketches> well peeps go to play on pc for fps' because they have mouse and keyboard
[3:45:11] <+Aeoneth> Blisk
[3:45:11] <@akuda_bar> @Snakeofdeath91 https://streamlabs.com/woolieversus
[3:45:11] <CalderGaming> he's south african
[3:45:13] <blink289> this is titanfall 3
[3:45:15] <+Aeoneth> Kublen Blisk
[3:45:15] <+SirG005E> maybe its time to start learning mouse and keyboard, eh?
[3:45:16] <%imextremelymanly> only serious player on pc lol
[3:45:16] <+Afterman_> woolie playing fortnite?
[3:45:19] <+goose_attack_almanac> @Ordinaryknight Yeah he Mastiff is still a thing. It's specifically a real rare gun
[3:45:20] <dozind16> he's really old
[3:45:21] <BigNerdSam> Blisk is S.African
[3:45:24] <foreverN2dust> Apex was a faction in titanfall.
[3:45:27] <%ChickenNuglets> @WoolieVersus You don't need to feel nervous about playing badly. We all start somewhere. You'll learn!
[3:45:27] <%Ariksgabs> BibleThump
[3:45:32] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean you're doing better than I have so far, my first game I died in less than a minute
[3:45:34] <+SneakTheBeak> apatBig <3
[3:45:37] <+DingusMcFadden> Can we get a lore dump, @WoolieVersus ?
[3:45:38] <%UrsulaCat> DO NOT BE MEAN TO WOOLIE
[3:45:38] <Daiidalus> BT is possibly in the scrap pile after 30 years BibleThump
[3:45:38] <+Snakeofdeath91> Can I donate woolie?
[3:45:39] <+blastazoid26> Thats fine bro
[3:45:40] <umbypokochan> i wouldn't say this is a Woolie game
[3:45:40] <+applefibs> it's ok if you don't know the items or spawns, but you have to able to aim at the bad guys...
[3:45:41] <ebonifragaria> We love garbage
[3:45:41] <Gutsandlove> Take yout time
[3:45:41] <%Eaglestrike117> He's not fucking britiish woolie, he's south african
[3:45:44] <+Big_Dream> You enjoying TF3
[3:45:44] <+blastazoid26> We love the garbo
[3:45:47] <@akuda_bar> hahahha
[3:45:50] <%ZaibatsuFan> That's not the brand I'm looking for here.
[3:45:52] <gunstar73> Pre Johns honestly I’m probably just as bad tho
[3:45:53] <+VanaSkiller> We all know you're a fighting game main
[3:45:53] <ShadowSketches> Woolie thrives in the garbage
[3:45:54] <+cvp5127> so battle royale is harder than dmc confirmed
[3:45:55] <+Andrizzleton> everybody is here for you woolz
[3:45:55] <+Aeoneth> Woolie I rarely watch you or Pat and want to see you know what you are doing.
[3:45:59] <+LeroyOctopus> @WoolieVersus did you see sonicfox was streaming this yesterday?
[3:46:00] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus also. dont be shamed by people going EW gamepad player. i play fps on pc with my 360 gamepad because i was console person for so long im just comfortable with it
[3:46:03] <%riantDeliration> this is just the equivalent of when i attempt to play a fighting game
[3:46:04] <Suwaiya> i cant believe woolie inst a real gamer like me
[3:46:04] <%UrsulaCat> @Snakeofdeath91 click on the kirby link below the stream
[3:46:05] <RantingRavager> <3 you're a precious angel and have inherent value as a human being past your gameplay. We love and support you AngelThump
[3:46:07] <%Ariksgabs> You're already braver than some of us here just by simply trying this game out Woolz
[3:46:08] <+Clik404> @garbagenirvana no, obviously I love the fact that Respawn is breaking out into the public eye, and making mad bank, which is why the thought this might just be what we have now is bittersweet
[3:46:11] <MegaFangKing23> I'm the same. I was shit-talking myself when I partied up with PSN friends earlier when playing this as well. :,)
[3:46:13] <%SlugNut> How's Woolie doing, guys?
[3:46:13] <%ssjklyco> We came for garbage. Garbage is 90% pat streams
[3:46:14] <EnderGamma> Disclaimer or not, just have fun with it. You can't beat that guy.
[3:46:14] <CAPSLOCKlive> You need a graphic above your webcam saying "Pro Streamer" with an arrow pointing to you
[3:46:15] <Ordinaryknight> @goose_attack_almanac cool! That's one of my favorite guns in TF2, good to see it get play even if rare
[3:46:23] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus If it doesnt have a red NO sign on it, you can pick it up, and it sbest to do that
[3:46:26] <+Snakeofdeath91> Relax calm down you got this woolie
[3:46:27] <NickPowers3> Who are the best legends?
[3:46:27] <+Clik404> @garbagenirvana hopefully you’re right
[3:46:28] <Zebroneath> We admire your willingness to give this all a go.
[3:46:30] <%ZaibatsuFan> I'm looking for the man behind FIGHTERPEDIA.

[3:47:05] <ShinobiPhoenix> my first time playing Fortnite, I went right to my default settings, going off alone, gather stuff, and sniping. I lived for a long time and just killed random people.
[3:47:06] <@mothmandraws> skullgod running
[3:47:07] <extradopeness> Big boi kills

[3:47:40] <ShadowSketches> if the hotzone doesnt have 20 squads in its vicinity then the game is not worth it
[3:47:50] <foreverN2dust> don't worry about winning, learn the systems and items first
[3:47:53] <@mothmandraws> jsut spam x grab it all at the start
[3:47:59] <$LetsGitGud> party1 Does woolie look at chat? I never managed to catch him stream ever party1
[3:48:03] <%terminallyCapriciousz> drop from the plane to the ground without guns even though you're a big big shoot guy
[3:48:03] <%riantDeliration> auto-equipping attachments is the best possible QoL change they couldve made
[3:48:05] <%ZaibatsuFan> @WoolieVersus So, did you say you & Reggie already recorded Jet Set Radio?
[3:48:15] <Amedamaneku> more than enough to kill anything that moves
[3:48:18] <@mothmandraws> more than enough to kill anything that moves woolie
[3:48:20] <@akuda_bar> @LetsGitGud not during matches
[3:48:22] <+EastwindGuru> Woolie you got the shotty pistol, you gotta pull up on niggas.
[3:48:22] <@mothmandraws> just be a distraction
[3:48:24] <%UrsulaCat> @LetsGitGud he does but he's not very good at figuring out what the cheers are
[3:48:33] <ShadowSketches> Woolie, use your hook so you can be a cool man
[3:48:34] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus Do you mind if the boys talk to you with ingame comms? they asked
[3:48:37] <MegaFangKing23> @LetsGitGud Yeah. He's responded to some people. Can't do it when playing. That would be too much to be fair.
[3:48:37] <sleepypegacorn> just pick up anything that you see early game
[3:48:44] <+drabberfaun535> class based fortnite
[3:48:47] <%imextremelymanly> you got it darlington
[3:48:49] <NinjaGentleman> Woolie that melee aint safe on wake up
[3:48:49] <+Shastafield> you gotta aim
[3:48:52] <%Cavumentum> I still think everyone who thinks Titanfall's Pilot Movement is bad for a battle royale are big cowards
[3:48:56] <ShadowSketches> dont use pheonix kit
[3:49:00] <ShadowSketches> dont even have armor
[3:49:04] <+Silentman0> woolie there's a difference between wearing weighted clothes and gimping yourself

[3:50:18] <@mothmandraws> let them kill
[3:50:18] <nawleenspoboy> @woolieversus do you think SNK will add characters from the last blade or other old titles into samurai shodown
[3:50:18] <+blastazoid26> Gotta take big Ls to get bigger Ws
[3:50:22] <ebonifragaria> Just cover your entire face in gamer goo
[3:50:23] <dapper_wulf> Hey, at the very least you're distracting the enemy Woolie.
[3:50:23] <EnderGamma> It's about the journey not the destination. Hold the Lessons.
[3:50:26] <@mothmandraws> (being tank might actually be good for you)

[3:50:33] <PlainSimpleTailor> Is Woolie going to change the description?
[3:50:33] <Vigonept> no need to be so down, youll get better
[3:50:38] <$Retrash> can you increase aim assist wil gamepad? @WoolieVersus

[3:50:56] <+EastwindGuru> You don't have a series called Get Into Shooters Woolie. You're learning like everyone else.
[3:51:03] <akita_opal> no worries you can get blown out a lot but it's those matches when you just go the right ways and get all the good level 3 gear that are worth it.

[4:04:24] <%TechTurtle7> basically
[4:04:48] <%TechTurtle7> not actually chappie but pretty much
[4:04:56] <ShinobiPhoenix> 2019 is the year of trying new things.

[4:06:09] <randomness_yo> k
[4:06:18] <+demon1103> seriously, this game needs a firing range to learn all the guns/mods and see what fits you
[4:06:21] <MONSTR_UwU> wish this character had a better passive
[4:06:29] <foreverN2dust> @demon1103 agreed
[4:06:31] <MegaFangKing23> @demon1103 Yes!
[4:06:32] <CalderGaming> @demon1103 it has one
[4:06:37] <BrachyZoid> Would be nice to be able to hear Woolie more
[4:06:42] <CalderGaming> there's a tutorial with exactly that

[4:07:40] <NinjaGentleman> bunny hopping
[4:07:41] <MegaFangKing23> @CalderGaming That's good to know. I'll check that out another time.
[4:07:43] <ShinobiPhoenix> @caldergaming I really hate Fortnite doesn't have that unless you get Save the World, but that's not available on Switch.
[4:07:44] <ECRead> bullet jumping?
[4:07:49] <foreverN2dust> Super Hamster Dumping
[4:07:53] <extradopeness> B hopping is CS
[4:07:54] <I_speel_my_dreenk> the Brits call it "skiddy bumping"
[4:07:55] <+Aeoneth> Slide hopping is possible on steep huills
[4:08:04] <@Solidus_113> grapple feels so worthless without wallrunning or climbing

[4:22:31] <xBolts4Lifex> I think
[4:22:31] <randomness_yo> oh yeah, Woolie is playing this on PC with no aim assist.
[4:22:34] <%riantDeliration> it plays with a controller well enough for me, but I also play on Ps4 so i face other controller users
[4:22:35] <+Aeoneth> Use it Strategically
[4:22:37] <@mothmandraws> consider escape routes
[4:22:38] <+Ninestempest> @mechslayer71 he tried it but his aim was much worse cause he can't be exact
[4:22:39] <bestwaifuritsu> oh shit, Woolie is Chappie
[4:22:39] <xBolts4Lifex> @Ninestempest i could be wrong
[4:22:40] <vextalyst> ppl need to stop with this controller bs yeah it's not optimal but many people make it work
[4:22:45] <Ropcord> it's good for flanking too

[4:23:11] <+Mukkeym1212> @riantdeliration On the PS4 do you know how to access those shield discs you collect? They make the blue shield bubble?

[4:31:30] <+Aeoneth> R301 + Alternator is good
[4:31:31] <%riantDeliration> I've seen one Triple Take in-game so far
[4:31:35] <@mothmandraws> or skull give him shotgun and have him watch for flanks
[4:31:52] <@akuda_bar> or do 33 damage

[4:33:24] <laguerrilha> As a VR game?
[4:33:25] <Magmalefilme> They got woolie
[4:33:27] <@akuda_bar> it's super not, the whole premium thing has gotta just be DLC
[4:33:29] <sirrice77> i still wish it had all the titanfall movement
[4:33:30] <Evilkaz> ah
[4:33:32] <+EastwindGuru> Drop the extra scope Woolz.
[4:33:32] <+Ninestempest> we dont know what the TF game is gonna be
[4:33:33] <@mothmandraws> im still expecting wall running as a character skill
[4:33:35] <Josef_Stryker> Wait Titanfall IS coming back?
[4:33:44] <+SuichiTanaka> WARNING: Incoming Game!
[4:33:44] <%UrsulaCat> Maybe
[4:33:47] <+Ninestempest> @mothmandraws god yes please, or maybe an alternative mode with wall running?
[4:33:48] <Gutsandlove> yup
[4:33:48] <Finakala> There's Titanfall SOMETHING happening
[4:33:49] <Fynale> sadly this has the same audio bug(not as bad) as the PC version of titanfall 2 did that made it unplayable
[4:33:50] <+axebird> I love this robot's VO.
[4:33:52] <Josef_Stryker> I'll take the maybe
[4:33:53] <nepwar> at this point, ill take titanfall dlc, especially if its campaign dlc
[4:33:54] <Superbro64> this just in, woolie backs down on his 5 stages of grief
[4:33:55] <+Mvrdok_> Once the salt is gone everything is sweet Kappa
[4:34:02] <+Ninestempest> @Fynale waht do you mean?
[4:34:03] <MegaFangKing23> On the podcast I heard it was cancelled?
[4:34:05] <+Aeoneth> Woolie: Tip for you always grab an Upgraded weapon mod. Upgrade path is White > Blue > Purple > Gold
[4:34:06] <laguerrilha> Heard wasnt going to be a Titan Fall 3, but a little side project
[4:34:09] <Worldbrand> yeah, they said there was a titanfall "premium" game that wouldn't be mobile or VR
[4:34:10] <%UrsulaCat> woolie is ALWAYS a sweetheart
[4:34:15] <%riantDeliration> @Josef_Stryker theyve said there will be a new "Premium Titanfall experience" whatver that means
[4:34:16] <%VyperVic> shout out to pat's crazy talk for activating on the "tf 3 is canceled" headline
[4:34:18] <Fynale> @Ninestempest like the audio glitches out and screaches in my ear
[4:34:22] <+goose_attack_almanac> @WoolieVersus I got over my bad feelings about the movement difference when I started rationalizing that not everyone is a Titan Pilot and thus not everyone is crazy mobile and badass.
[4:34:25] <+Shin_Kiryu> Woolie getting chummy with the murder of this child!?!!? Didn't see that coming.
[4:34:26] <@mothmandraws> woolie have you given the other classes a shot
[4:34:27] <I_speel_my_dreenk> the fabled double zip
[4:34:28] <FALCONxPAWNCH> Does the game have SOUL?
[4:34:30] <+Ninestempest> @Fynale weird, neve rhad this in this or TF2, that sucks
[4:34:34] <+EastwindGuru> PogChamp
[4:34:34] <WingsR6> @goose_attack_almanac agreed

[4:34:40] <+ZeroMP_> s u r v e y b e a c o n
[4:34:40] <Fynale> @Ninestempest apperently it's a graphics card issue
[4:34:47] <+Ninestempest> @Fynale sorry dawg :c
[4:34:50] <thunderlover97> what's good bois
[4:34:53] <%UrsulaCat> @mothmandraws he says he only likes the grappling hook
[4:35:01] <sirrice77> @goose_attack_almanac but you're people who are all supposed to be badass and competing to be the Apex so
[4:35:06] <@mothmandraws> wrong way
[4:35:07] <laguerrilha> I would prefer Titan Fall to remain ead instead of becoming a cellphone game or a VR game
[4:35:07] <nobknee> HAHAH
[4:35:09] <+DukeMoose> the r301 seems to be "the Gun" though
[4:35:10] <Fujiwara_92> LUL oof
[4:35:12] <Ordinaryknight> @goose_attack_almanac Hmm. When you put it like that I could warm up to this game
[4:35:13] <nobknee> Fuck.
[4:35:30] <Nmiser> you can stow your weapons to run faster @WoolieVersus
[4:35:30] <+Ninestempest> tfw woolie can't stream in pcmr framerate
[4:35:33] <C_Sixty_Jam> moon2PH Their successful game is a freaking BR with no mechs
[4:35:37] <@mothmandraws> the wall is coming
[4:35:42] <+Aeoneth> @DukeMoose R301 is goot general; purpose. But the Hemlock and Wingman are the Master Race weapons
[4:35:42] <@mothmandraws> 10 left
[4:35:42] <+VanaSkiller> stop making him look chat LUL
[4:35:47] <RekknLIVE> What? Woolie is making out with the murderer! PogChamp
[4:35:48] <Fynale> @WoolieVersus btw i found out by watching a guy that there is momentum when running up walls so you can grab higher ledges so that at least stayed
[4:35:56] <+Ninestempest> @C_Sixty_Jam sometimes, when you actually know what you're doing, chasing the trend is the best idea...
[4:35:59] <+Codex5050> @C_Sixty_Jam BibleThump BibleThump
[4:36:00] <JetpackMcQuack> Maybe EA should give studios more than one-two chances
[4:36:11] <+Shin_Kiryu> Holster gun to run faster @WoolieVersus
[4:36:14] <Finakala> 1-2 chances is too much lost money for EA
[4:36:21] <+Ninestempest> DAT MOMENTUM THO
[4:36:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:36:24] <+Codex5050> maybe EA shouldn't purposely tank the game they publish
[4:36:30] <+goose_attack_almanac> @Ordinaryknight Also that the game isn't called Titanfall: Apex Legends. Just Apex Legends. A game that is only related to Titanfall by universe. Because Titanfall is Pilot vs Pilot not Blood Sport Mercvs Merc
[4:36:33] <@mothmandraws> woolie staying back and spotting might do good
[4:36:37] <C_Sixty_Jam> @Ninestempest It doesn't make it hurt any less BibleThump
[4:36:41] <MegaFangKing23> @Ninestempest Referring to Cliffy B. a little bit? LUL
[4:36:43] <MrMysteryMask> is he on PC?
[4:36:51] <+Ninestempest> @Codex5050 it's long been established that respawn chose the release date, adn that they LITERALLY told respawn to release it later.
[4:36:54] <$GoogleyGareth> Just joined, he playin with friends?
[4:36:57] <+Ninestempest> @MegaFangKing23 no never who is that sounds liek a nobody
[4:37:01] <+EastwindGuru> Yeah
[4:37:08] <Fynale> also btw a lot of the guns in this game are just the tf2 guns
[4:37:12] <Finakala> This game already looks and works better than Anthem at least
[4:37:18] <Fynale> like that alternator is just the 2 shot smg
[4:37:20] <Ordinaryknight> @goose_attack_almanac True
[4:37:25] <MegaFangKing23> @Ninestempest Eh, just some guy. Don't worry bout it.

[4:42:41] <Worldbrand> if you can't aim - which, controller - go close range, not mid
[4:42:42] <TheAmazingClaytor> It's easy when you play against people who use controllers too
[4:42:49] <ValidVenasaur> wait he's playing on PC with a controller?
[4:42:51] <%tank7013> The problem at this point is more his ability to track enemies than his aim
[4:42:53] <Youwereeatenbyalid> TAKE THAT EASY OUT WOOLIE

[4:52:22] <Skatedeandre> This is a good game
[4:52:24] <+VanaSkiller> a lot
[4:52:26] <laguerrilha> Weirdly enough it seems this will probably substitute Fortnite as the free BR since people like to shit on the popular game and this isnt bad
[4:52:26] <chancho4tierra> its a good game
[4:52:28] <T_Sasquatch> youre a normie now
[4:52:28] <%UrsulaCat> have I lost my mind

[5:01:05] <tubeman642> That happens on console too its a bug
[5:01:06] <+Bananaking744> pathfinder is the best
[5:01:07] <MegaFangKing23> @psycosis It's from the people who made Titanfall but Battle Royale.
[5:01:07] <Skatedeandre> @mothmandraws LUL
[5:01:15] <+Ecchigun> we will never abandon woolie
[5:01:15] <@mothmandraws> also its cause it would have to cancel all game if 1 person dropped

[5:01:16] <%UrsulaCat> MOTHMAN DO NOT BULLY WOOLIE
[5:01:18] <%ZaibatsuFan> That happens in Blackout too.
[5:01:20] <Rigenstein> I feel an extra hero for each class would have been better
[5:01:23] <+supaXmugen> The only bug is crashing
[5:01:26] <chromdad> 200% SCRUB
[5:01:32] <@mothmandraws> which would cause big problems if it always had to restart games
[5:01:33] <foreverN2dust> @ToastyBroDude yeah, it's baffling. Woolie is a hard M.
[5:01:33] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus You're doin' better at the BR shooter than I'd do at the fightin' games, so you're good. Don't let it set in, bud.
[5:01:35] <Skatedeandre> The most common bug is crashing
[5:01:39] <TC_Lagann> is that THE legendary @mothmandraws ?
[5:01:39] <MegaFangKing23> @Rigenstein You're not wrong.
[5:01:44] <%psycosis> Titanfall 2 tho?

[5:01:55] <Skatedeandre> Nah this isn’t titanfall
[5:01:57] <chancho4tierra> this is a good game, but a keyboard and mouse good game
[5:02:02] <Skatedeandre> Just plays like it
[5:02:05] <ToastyBroDude> @foreverN2dust like, he knows he's at a constant disadvantage right?
[5:02:05] <nina9669> ive run into a bunch of connection bugs with this game but nothing a reset cant fix
[5:02:08] <HanPaul> Bamboozle master Pog
[5:02:09] <MegaFangKing23> The extra characters aren't that visually interesting. The available cast is more interesting.

[5:02:16] <TC_Lagann> @mothmandraws LUL
[5:02:18] <+demon1103> anyone else kinda just want Pat to kick down his door,slap him in face, unplug the controller, and put the mouse in his hand XD (just messin around)
[5:02:21] <chromdad> titfall 2 is so much better though
[5:02:24] <MegaFangKing23> APEX bucks LUL
[5:02:26] <Rigenstein> Woolie sill using that config he had for Overwatch?
[5:02:27] <+CourageTheCat> LUL
[5:02:27] <ToastyBroDude> Also Mirage is voiced by Roger Craig Smith, AKA Sonic Boom, Dying Light.
[5:02:30] <foreverN2dust> @ToastyBroDude With how much me and other have been whining in chat, I can only hope
[5:02:30] <+KilogramHours> PAT
[5:02:35] <nobknee> PAT
[5:02:35] <Skatedeandre> @demon1103 pat would also use a controller
[5:02:36] <Cthulos> Roger Craig Smith, Ezio and Sonic
[5:02:40] <+KilogramHours> sbfpPat sbfpPat sbfpPat sbfpPat
[5:02:41] <Zombrocom> Pat plays shoot games on controller too
[5:02:42] <Nope80808> Yeah Pat why?
[5:02:42] <laguerrilha> Once you become LIT
[5:02:43] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @WoolieVersus why...? woolie why???
[5:02:44] <HanPaul> is Woolie playing with his jank assmouse + pad setup ?
[5:02:46] <Josef_Stryker> Pat
[5:02:46] <+kewlmyc> I LOVE GAMBLING
[5:02:46] <TC_Lagann> return to Overwatch Confirmed?
[5:02:48] <+Sygoth> to support the game
[5:02:52] <%UrsulaCat> what costume
[5:02:53] <nepwar> all ingame currency needs to be renamed to bison bucks
[5:02:54] <%psycosis> Because RNG is ass in Overwatch
[5:02:54] <nina9669> PAT
[5:02:55] <Skatedeandre> Pat plays warframe on pc with a controller
[5:02:56] <randomness_yo> it's F2P, why use money at all
[5:02:58] <T_Sasquatch> because they are gambling addicts
[5:02:59] <Lunatyr_> Pat LUL
[5:03:00] <%UrsulaCat> what costume did woolie want
[5:03:06] <+supaXmugen> To the guy who asked. its the same reason people buy card packs IRL
[5:03:06] <+Story_Ark> i wanted a short hair Sombra so i bought loot boxes :/
[5:03:08] <ShinobiPhoenix> actually my "fighting games" problem would be Civ Vi and Monster Hunter at this point...
[5:03:08] <+KilogramHours> sbfpPatschwitz LOOTBOXES?
[5:03:09] <MegaFangKing23> I do if for Overwatch because I'm dumb. :(
[5:03:10] <+VanaSkiller> LUL
[5:03:14] <ebonifragaria> Because someone donated money and basically FORCED you to buy them!
[5:03:15] <Nope80808> @Skatedeandre ah thats different its character action
[5:03:19] <MegaFangKing23> I like some of the cosmetics too much.
[5:03:19] <Synchroscheme> gatcha is a plague
[5:03:20] <Skatedeandre> Nah you there’s virtual currency
[5:03:20] <nina9669> PAT with that hots loot box stream
[5:03:22] <Objurgo> Caustic looks cool but his abilities don't seem useful unless youre willing to sit tight
[5:03:23] <Worldbrand> yeah but pat makes his money back when he does it because we're crazy
[5:03:24] <Finakala> At least with OW you can buy what you want with ingame currency
[5:03:26] <nepwar> no no its was chats fault that pat bought all those lootboxes
[5:03:30] <+LogothX> Titanfall 2 had purchasable cosmetics
[5:03:31] <nepwar> and all that plat
[5:03:31] <ToastyBroDude> @Skatedeandre Yea but Warframe is PvE, not PvP
[5:03:38] <+PenmanLupine> Pats HOTS and Overwatch lootbox streams were literal problems
[5:03:40] <nobknee> Pat with the WarFrame excuses.
[5:03:40] <Skatedeandre> @nope80808 re 2 with a controller?
[5:03:45] <%psycosis> RNG is ass in Overwatch that's why people buy them
[5:03:47] <T_Sasquatch> just sell it directly dammit
[5:03:48] <MegaFangKing23> SF costumes are rad to.
[5:03:49] <+PenmanLupine> especially HOTS cause he only played that game like 3 times
[5:03:54] <nina9669> Pat was a cam girl for 3hrs
[5:03:56] <+supaXmugen> i would rather earn credits to get stuff i want
[5:03:57] <Skatedeandre> There’s still FPS aspects in warframe though
[5:03:58] <+KilogramHours> sbfpDattebayo sbfpPatschwitz LOOTBOXES
[5:04:01] <DomunDomunDomun> Gameplay affecting microtransactions are worse than lootboxes, and this has those too.
[5:04:02] <+demon1103> warframes also not first person
[5:04:08] <MegaFangKing23> @psycosis A 1000% agree!
[5:04:08] <Skatedeandre> Oh yeah
[5:04:10] <+Aeoneth> I have done this
[5:04:13] <%VyperVic> They have done it
[5:04:15] <+Sygoth> Played the Anthem demo and now want to play more warframe
[5:04:17] <Skatedeandre> I forgot it’s 3rd persona
[5:04:19] <KiraKamixephos> Hold “E”
[5:04:23] <Worldbrand> there are so many alternatives to gunshootaims in warframe
[5:04:26] <ToastyBroDude> @Skatedeandre No but what Im talking about is the disadvantage against other players, who are using keyboard and mosue.
[5:04:28] <$SilverRoddo> I bought digital yugioh cards, once, for buff Amazoness cards. Which hasn't improved my win ratio.
[5:04:30] <+VanaSkiller> at least he knows
[5:04:36] <nina9669> no
[5:04:36] <%UrsulaCat> woolie doesn't snipe he's very nice
[5:04:36] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[5:04:36] <+ZeroMP_> pistol and alternator for woolie lol perfect loot
[5:04:37] <+Story_Ark> @skatedeandre 3rd Persona is my fave one :P
[5:04:40] <JetpackMcQuack> Falling for shitty monetization isn’t condoning it
[5:04:40] <+dickbuttwoman> Longbow
[5:04:42] <Worldbrand> plus that game doesn't really have skill checks, just gear checks
[5:04:45] <pive123456> sorry I just got on. does Woolie like this???
[5:04:48] <%VyperVic> @Skatedeandre this is not persona 3 this is apex
[5:04:49] <+KilogramHours> Hey chat. Did Apex Legends completely kill Anthem?
[5:04:50] <Skatedeandre> @toastybrodude oh ok I get you
[5:04:52] <C_Sixty_Jam> This game has FATALITIES TOO
[5:04:53] <MegaFangKing23> Yeah kind of.
[5:04:54] <Nope80808> Warframe isnt crippling with controller. especially since you dont even have to use the guns.
[5:04:57] <randomness_yo> sniping with a controller on PC.....
[5:04:57] <nina9669> no one really?
[5:05:11] <%VyperVic> @KilogramHours anthem and ea killed anthem
[5:05:16] <laguerrilha> This ship reminds me of that futuristic Battlefield game no one played
[5:05:16] <bestwaifuritsu> apex legends is probably doing way better than anthem
[5:05:23] <randomness_yo> ^
[5:05:26] <Nope80808> Hell i almost never use guns in warframe
[5:05:28] <bestwaifuritsu> @laguerrilha 2142 was great
[5:05:28] <Finakala> Battlefield 2142?
[5:05:30] <randomness_yo> Anthem is a buggy mess
[5:05:33] <%VyperVic> is anthem even out
[5:05:34] <%UrsulaCat> what is anthem
[5:05:35] <nobknee> Did Anthem come out? I don't follow bad games I don't ever wanna play.
[5:05:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Anthem ain't even out yet
[5:05:36] <ShinobiPhoenix> @silverroddo in Dual Links? I thought you couldn't buy cards directly at all? just packs?
[5:05:40] <T_Sasquatch> @KilogramHours honestly , if apex legends lasts 2 weeks until anthem is out then rip anthem
[5:05:43] <chromdad> respawn made a better half ass game than a full bioware game and im not surprised
[5:05:45] <%UrsulaCat> is that the game with the masks
[5:05:45] <C_Sixty_Jam> You mean the Anthem demo? moon2WOW
[5:05:47] <Skatedeandre> @toastybrodude are pc and console players in the same matchmaking? Usually they’re kept separate for that reason
[5:05:49] <MegaFangKing23> Anthem is out in 2 weeks or so.
[5:05:56] <%DXLelouch24> Im tapping out chat,ill be back for Mr X to give it to Woolie Saturday
[5:05:57] <cerazor01> oooh boooyyy "anthem" how topical
[5:05:58] <+D33TR> i wouldnt call this game half ass
[5:06:02] <Johannen> How is @WoolieVersus liking this so far?
[5:06:02] <Nope80808> You know whatd be fucked up if this game outpreforms anthem for this month
[5:06:07] <foreverN2dust> @Skatedeandre it's not crossplatform, no
[5:06:08] <MegaFangKing23> @DXLelouch24 Laters!
[5:06:10] <ToastyBroDude> @Skatedeandre No, he's palying a PC copy of the game, but using a controller
[5:06:18] <randomness_yo> I'm just gonna call it now, Anthem will come out as a buggy mess.
[5:06:20] <Skatedeandre> @toastybrodude ah I see
[5:06:21] <cerazor01> I hope Woolie plays Re2 sometime.
[5:06:26] <%UrsulaCat> @Johannen he seems to like it even though he doesn't think he's very good at it
[5:06:29] <Finakala> Everything I've seen regarding Anthem makes it look like it'll fail
[5:06:29] <%DXLelouch24> He is
[5:06:38] <MegaFangKing23> @cerazor01 This Saturday he will with Pat.
[5:06:41] <Objurgo> no gun opponent
[5:06:41] <foreverN2dust> @cerazor01 he said he would on the podcast I think
[5:06:43] <+LogothX> that was a decoy
[5:06:43] <ShinobiPhoenix> @cerazor01 Saturday. he is Saturday
[5:06:44] <extradopeness> He said he was
[5:06:45] <%UrsulaCat> woolie is incredibly good at videgames
[5:06:48] <Josef_Stryker> Dat aim tho
[5:06:57] <ToastyBroDude> @Skatedeandre I know he's expressed not liking using a keyboard for shooting so why would he not just play on console, is what im wondering
[5:07:00] <T_Sasquatch> ive no idea what youre shooting at LUL
[5:07:05] <chromdad> dammit now i want to try this shit
[5:07:06] <%Twoiis> Pourquoi?
[5:07:08] <Skatedeandre> If anthem releases as buggy as it was that’s bad news
[5:07:11] <chromdad> why
[5:07:11] <randomness_yo> lol those aimming skillz
[5:07:14] <Johannen> That's good. Are his buddies on PC ?
[5:07:17] <seylumiue> Hes shooting the ghosts
[5:07:21] <Johannen> I wonder why not PS4
[5:07:21] <+KilogramHours> @Johannen yes
[5:07:28] <Nope80808> @ToastyBroDude I believe he said his friends who play shooter primarily play pc
[5:07:29] <Josef_Stryker> If Woolie is gonna use a controller, then why not just play on PS4?
[5:07:29] <+KilogramHours> @Johannen They are PC gamers
[5:07:30] <Rigenstein> inject adrenaline into a bot?!!
[5:07:30] <@mothmandraws> you got bamboozled by decoy tbf there
[5:07:34] <laguerrilha> I wanted to buy and play Battledield 2142, but 5 months in and i heard it was a desert lobby. All the trailers were great
[5:07:42] <+KilogramHours> @Josef_Stryker Friends don't wanna play PS4
[5:07:47] <nepwar> another thing about these types of games is you gotta constantly be talking about whats going on
[5:07:56] <ToastyBroDude> @Nope80808 Ok
[5:08:02] <randomness_yo> This game might be the game EA is looking for. I dont think Anthem is that game
[5:08:03] <Rigenstein> honeslty the ping system is great here
[5:08:07] <ToastyBroDude> wel[p
[5:08:08] <+demon1103> @ToastyBroDude wait...thats why he's using a controller.....I...but....
[5:08:08] <Skatedeandre> @toastybrodude he used a Kbm setup for overwatch so maybe he figured out he likes controller more
[5:08:11] <$SilverRoddo> Hi, ShinobiPheonix, not on Duel Links, although, i'll like to try that, however, i'm playing on the previous game, Duel Generation on ipad, you can play for free and make purchases through itunes.
[5:08:28] <Johannen> The whole squad managment is real good. Me and my buddies cant stop playing it
[5:08:41] <Objurgo> gonna get caught by the ring
[5:08:41] <MegaFangKing23> Save him! BibleThump
[5:08:41] <KiraKamixephos> How did woolie even play titanfall
[5:08:42] <%GarbageNirvana> I'd probably play this if I had buddies
[5:08:49] <%UrsulaCat> @mothmandraws I always read tbf as two best friends for an entire 10 seconds before I remember to be fair
[5:08:59] <ToastyBroDude> @demon1103 yea he a almost no chance against kb+m, but hios friends play PC soooo....
[5:09:00] <Johannen> I woulda guess he played it on @KiraKamixephos
[5:09:01] <Skatedeandre> They played it on SBFP (rip)
[5:09:02] <ModeratelyHardcore> See yah later Woolie. You'll get the hang of it.
[5:09:03] <Johannen> ps4
[5:09:11] <+supaXmugen> but its a team game tho...
[5:09:19] <+supaXmugen> so the game only works with friends
[5:09:21] <$Chumblago13> is he having fun?
[5:09:24] <nobknee> Hopefully, with Anthem's likely failure, the corpse of BioWare will finally be allowed to stop bein' forced to dance by puppet strings and go in the dirt.
[5:09:30] <Nope80808> I get the struggle of aligning to a platform you aint good at for friends. I cant play fps for shit on controller but all my friends who do fps play ps4
[5:09:31] <laguerrilha> @UrsulaCat i always forget it means "to be fair" because of the channel too
[5:09:33] <KiraKamixephos> @johannen he said on the podcast he played on Origin
[5:09:35] <FreedomARX7> l
[5:09:40] <%GarbageNirvana> @supaXmugen I mean you can queue in solo but you'll always get teamed up with randos
[5:09:45] <%UrsulaCat> who got green greens in the divorce?
[5:09:45] <Skatedeandre> Speaking truthfully having comms is vital to winning
[5:09:57] <%NKOrange> Gotta pull that cluch woolz
[5:09:58] <Skatedeandre> Woolie probably
[5:09:58] <$SilverRoddo> When are the money Apex battles?

[5:12:16] <nepwar> i hope youtube comments do a 180 and praise him for being a god at apex
[5:12:18] <tubeman642> No Pistols POINTER
[5:12:19] <laguerrilha> Bullets hurt more when they hit the enemy Kappa
[5:12:20] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its ok. we all can be bad. Just pick Gibraltar or Lifeline and be a dude who carries 8 different grenades) Its super easy to help your team with them and call out enemies
[5:12:22] <BigNerdSam> @woolieversus press and hold LT to aim better
[5:12:23] <KiraKamixephos> Play on console
[5:12:23] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus just remember, they suck at Ikaruga
[5:12:24] <+supaXmugen> play a legend that people can carry you with
[5:12:24] <+DestroyerPhoenix> He also knows about the controller hate too just FYI guys :p
[5:12:24] <thelovingfool> dont aim at the floor
[5:12:24] <+ZeroMP_> yknow i always thought that lighting behind woolie was daytime light from a window, but i realized it's probably just the lighting from the shelf
[5:12:25] <%fFailureatlife> where's BT?
[5:12:26] <%TechTurtle7> its fine
[5:12:30] <AmericanaRed> You should go medic
[5:12:32] <+supaXmugen> like a lifeline or gibraltor
[5:12:32] <$FuqBoiSlim> you need to shoot them 4Head
[5:12:34] <MegaFangKing23> I got to 2nd place to today.
[5:12:37] <Fenrirlives> @WoolieVersus lesson number one: switch to mouse and keyboard
[5:12:39] <Skatedeandre> Pistols are hot garbage in this too
[5:12:41] <+UnU__> switch to mouse and kb coward
[5:12:42] <$SilverRoddo> This game needs a Legend Killer pose emote.
[5:12:43] <+ACRAZEDMONKEY> point the barrel at the bad guy
[5:12:44] <+demon1103> @WoolieVersus dont feel bad Woolie. you make the rest of us feel better about how awful we are XD
[5:12:45] <@mothmandraws> I think mostly you would benefit more considering terrain more and placing yourself more effectivly
[5:12:48] <+supaXmugen> @WoolieVersus play lifeline or gibraltor
[5:12:49] <%TechTurtle7> this is fine
[5:12:50] <+Invaderjaymz> i feel like another chracter will help
[5:12:51] <nepwar> BT BR
[5:12:58] <randomness_yo> tips huh? Lets start by dropping the controller and get on tha mouse and keyboard. lol
[5:13:02] <tysmiller> the only thing i can't believe is he's streaming the game he just spent an hour ranting about like it ruined his life...
[5:13:07] <ToastyBroDude> or playing on console
[5:13:20] <+arfafax> ezaCrunch ezaSophie
[5:13:21] <%fFailureatlife> ok so this game but every team has one titan that they have to arm and maintain
[5:13:24] <ShinobiPhoenix> you know Titans are coming in some expansion later, for like 20 bucks each
[5:13:27] <$FuqBoiSlim> @tysmiller at the end of the days it's all video games
[5:13:28] <Johannen> Another chracter will def help. But he can realy help with grenade spam.^_^
[5:13:32] <Fenrirlives> actual advice tho, I say stick to shotguns and melee since you're pretty good at Juking
[5:13:36] <+TopTieramisu> tbf, he was railing on what the game represented
[5:13:39] <+TopTieramisu> not the game itself
[5:13:43] <GoDZooKii> People saying pistols are bad. Yet i'm over here with 90% Wingman kills.
[5:13:58] <+supaXmugen> @fFailureatlife you just made the best br ever and people should give you money. how do you feel?
[5:14:00] <Skatedeandre> Wingman is a magnum
[5:14:05] <Metheonlyme156> this is the man who is slowing dying on live stream.
[5:14:09] <nepwar> insight gained
[5:14:10] <Worldbrand> i'm wearing two cardigans
[5:14:10] <DeathByPoke7> so much quality of life changes in this game
[5:14:13] <GoDZooKii> Still a pistol bud
[5:14:19] <%UrsulaCat> There goes mmy hero
[5:14:23] <%UrsulaCat> watch him as he goes
[5:14:28] <$FuqBoiSlim> !uptime
[5:14:28] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 14 minutes
[5:14:29] <Objurgo> trade out the devotion tbh
[5:14:31] <%Twoiis> funny zipline
[5:14:36] <@mothmandraws> shotgun will work best for woolie, he can go for atleast his few hits being higher damage
[5:14:36] <+supaXmugen> @UrsulaCat aim for the bushes
[5:14:40] <+dickbuttwoman> Devotion is trash unless supercharger
[5:14:40] <extradopeness> Lol
[5:14:40] <+ZeroMP_> best QoL in this game is the colored boxes that dead players drop by far
[5:14:42] <%fFailureatlife> @supaXmugen could be worse tbh
[5:14:52] <Rigenstein> I wanna bet theres going to be a hero that can wall run
[5:14:55] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Grenades are super good and easy to use on gamepad. Just throw grenades and cover fire
[5:15:06] <%fFailureatlife> remember when devotion was a fucking monster in tf2
[5:15:08] <Metheonlyme156> has anyone tried playing it on ps4 b/c i cant get a match
[5:15:08] <+supaXmugen> @fFailureatlife no way
[5:15:08] <$KennyVenture> weird apex, but okay
[5:15:17] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus Woolie you can clamber up walls like Hanzo
[5:15:18] <GoDZooKii> I honestly think all guns have a place.
[5:15:18] <%GarbageNirvana> So yeah, I'll probably give this game a proper look once they actually implement the solo mode
[5:15:22] <%fFailureatlife> and the spitfire was trash
[5:15:26] <Skatedeandre> It’s working fine on PS4
[5:15:32] <+supaXmugen> i would still rather have mech
[5:15:33] <+KilogramHours> TAKE YOUR TIME WOOLIE
[5:15:39] <%BlitzChocula> The SBFP Network on PC could use some fresh blood. Just sayin!
[5:15:42] <$SilverRoddo> To paraphrase the movie Speed: "Woolie, don't get dead."
[5:15:42] <%UrsulaCat> Woolie you'll win for sure this time
[5:15:43] <%fFailureatlife> now the spitfire is god like and the devotion is worthless LUL
[5:15:44] <Rigenstein> I doubt this will have solo mode, they have classes
[5:15:44] <Johannen> @GarbageNirvana Solo modo is not intented with this game
[5:15:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Or else try to find someone on PST time who'd be willing to squad up
[5:15:45] <Stormo> @Metheonlyme156 I had no trouble getting a game on PS4 the other day
[5:15:46] <mayorrev> caustic looks cool, what does he do
[5:15:50] <ToastyBroDude> ...
[5:15:58] <+TopTieramisu> poison gas
[5:15:58] <Objurgo> He throws down acid traps
[5:15:59] <+dickbuttwoman> @WoolieVersus There are two, one really far away
[5:15:59] <+KilogramHours> WOOLIE IS A WHOLESOME BOY
[5:16:00] <%GarbageNirvana> @Johannen Well I'm sure as hell not playing with randos
[5:16:01] <Rigenstein> @mayorrev poison
[5:16:03] <Skatedeandre> @mayorrev toxic gas
[5:16:04] <+supaXmugen> @mayorrev defends points with gas
[5:16:08] <mayorrev> cool
[5:16:10] <%Eaglestrike117> woolie is going th wrong fucking way
[5:16:11] <Sebthemachinist> Hmm? What’s this? Having dinner with the man that killed your son after all, it seems. lytOUCH
[5:16:13] <%foreverN2dust> @mayorrev fart gas

[5:16:43] <+TopTieramisu> so when are they adding a punch girl in this br
[5:16:54] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Does he know he can wall climb for a good while if he holds jump?
[5:16:56] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm wary of the PC version of this game if only because Origin
[5:17:00] <+supaXmugen> @mayorrev probably never since it might be broke

[5:20:07] <GoDZooKii> Ok aim now

[5:20:19] <keksisblyat> Woolies left trigger doesnt exist Kappa Kappa
[5:20:21] <ToastyBroDude> @WoolieVersus Please just aim woolz
[5:20:23] <Johannen> Is there any kind aim assist on PC with a gamepad or slowdown on enemies?
[5:20:24] <randomness_yo> Aim Woolie
[5:20:26] <+SuichiTanaka> I think Woolie just isn't holding jump
[5:20:28] <BeNiceImShy> What? But then how will I snack on hot and tasty shells right out of the gun-oven?
