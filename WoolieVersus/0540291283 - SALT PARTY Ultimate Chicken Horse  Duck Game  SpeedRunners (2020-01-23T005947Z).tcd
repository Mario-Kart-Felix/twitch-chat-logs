[0:16:24] <dapperskeleton69> TTT salt party lets go
[0:16:26] <+LiveStreamOnyx> lorNANI
[0:16:26] <+isitaspider> TTT is legit super good too
[0:16:29] <%Irridium> look at it this way, you went this long without knowing and got on fine. It doesn't matter. None of this matters. Entropy will end us all eventually
[0:16:33] <+MrTAteMyBalls> yall need a gmod night
[0:16:34] <+Darren716> EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THOUGH WOOLIE
[0:16:37] <+MTLer> Hogwarts RP let's go Reggie
[0:16:41] <OkamiDude15> TTT with the gang would be AMAZING
[0:16:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> TTT streams LET GO
[0:16:44] <JaseAdrift> YOU ARE SO LATE
[0:16:47] <dapperskeleton69> yo darkrp night lets go
[0:16:50] <%GraceTBM> I've been playing half life and source games since I was 10 bit I've played less than half a dozen fighting games
[0:16:50] <powerprotoman> right pockets of alternate realities like the one you guys came from
[0:16:54] <$Gehtingsberg> Super late!
[0:16:55] <+isitaspider> Seeing the whole group (Pat, Woolie, the girls, and all of the friends) playing TTT would be super legit
[0:16:55] <%RioGascar> Im still just surprised you never played half life
[0:16:56] <%Quiet__Viking> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN DEATH NOTE
[0:16:57] <invisi_bliss> what??? people have different tastes??? NotLikeThis
[0:16:57] <Ion_Laser> I could understand that happening if the gaming community abbreviates Garry's Mod to GMod
[0:16:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> Prop Hunt Stream would be sick
[0:16:59] <Solidnick18> prop hunt party PogChamp
[0:17:02] <adamisfruit> G Mod is pretty much common knowledge
[0:17:06] <+isitaspider> Seeing everybody shoot Pat on sight would be 10/10
[0:17:07] <%Jetzord> It's fine, G Mod isn't that important
[0:17:10] <heart_ablaze> jesus christ you guys are massive boomers
[0:17:11] <valriot> So is GMod basically poverty Unity?
[0:17:11] <Vigogs> I know :)
[0:17:12] <@Solidus_113> get me to Montreal and I'll learn you about Garry's Mod
[0:17:13] <JaseAdrift> Thats a big ass blind spot
[0:17:20] <$Gehtingsberg> Prop hunt is pretty fun tbh
[0:17:27] <XzileGaming> ohgod heres the gmod discussion again
[0:17:30] <dapperskeleton69> @solidus_113 eyyyyy solidus
[0:17:32] <Kriss1827> Gmod streams would be pretty hype
[0:17:36] <+wmeldrum> woolz sound like he in an intervention
[0:17:37] <%GraceTBM> it's a niche. it's a mod community for a decade old game
[0:17:42] <%Irridium> ah prop hunt that TF2 mode
[0:17:44] <+Polter_ge1st> GMod Prop Hunt is pretty fun ngl
[0:17:51] <autumnsfall> I've seen gmod like once for maybe 10 seconds
[0:17:52] <+gustavozxd> I played the HL games for the first time like last month
[0:17:54] <+isitaspider> Prop hunt is pretty good, but I still argue that TTT is the one game that nearly everybody can enjoy regardless of skill level
[0:17:55] <+MTLer> table top simulator
[0:17:57] <pixel_river> gmod multi was so fun
[0:18:01] <XzileGaming> GRANDPAs FIRST GMOD 2020
[0:18:06] <ChansonNoire> atpCap atpCap atpCap
[0:18:07] <dapperskeleton69> i went hard on TTT ive watched servers rise and fall man gmod is a world all its own
[0:18:08] <+isitaspider> TTT and Murder
[0:18:09] <OkamiDude15> gmod is basically mugen you can do a lot
[0:18:39] <%RioGascar> I’d argue that having played half life would give you proper context for the evolution of video games
[0:18:42] <%GraceTBM> agreed okami
[0:18:45] <+Jake_Protagonist> It was every generation below you childhood hence the complete bafflement
[0:18:47] <TopLeftCenter> Post a personal ad, "looking for friend to keep me up to date about Dwarf Fortress"
[0:18:49] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:18:49] <+isitaspider> Real life TTT is also 10/10
[0:18:52] <dapperskeleton69> you havent played gmod until youve been in a server while they talkin mod scandals and shit
[0:18:57] <+isitaspider> Just get a ton of nerf guns
[0:18:57] <+Vigonept> chat knows everything tho
[0:18:59] <%RioGascar> But like...fighting games never really considered narrative
[0:19:06] <JaseAdrift> ok boomers
[0:19:11] <BallerSwagBro9k> I don't know about MOBAS and MMORPGS that's it
[0:19:25] <artificiallynatural> but gmod DEFINED the internet for such a long time
[0:19:31] <%GraceTBM> yes, no gameboy color players liked half life, I see
[0:19:38] <%RioGascar> now heres also the big thing
[0:19:38] <dapperskeleton69> gmod started entire youtube channels
[0:19:43] <%RioGascar> Gmod was for poor people
[0:19:48] <%RioGascar> you got half life
[0:19:51] <%RioGascar> And you got gmod
[0:19:54] <Solidnick18> like seananners
[0:19:57] <%RioGascar> And you have no other money
[0:19:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> VanossGaming much?
[0:20:02] <%GraceTBM> it's a big fish in a relatively small pond
[0:20:05] <dan_g_v> what is gmod?
[0:20:05] <+Jake_Protagonist> Honestly if you don’t watch other YouTube gaming videos that’s probably why
[0:20:06] <dapperskeleton69> @riogascar dont you dare leave CSS out
[0:20:08] <valriot> I thought GMod was just My Brand and Legion And Friends
[0:20:09] <%RioGascar> so time to create a bunch of game modes and browse servers
[0:20:25] <+McSoliace> Xavier Woods is the only person i've seen have barely any blind spots
[0:20:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> WAT

[0:32:43] <DedlokPM> Ultimate mogsChikin Horse
[0:32:45] <Vyneci> This is way more chaotic I think
[0:32:55] <dapperskeleton69> that jetpack is ez mode
[0:32:55] <primaryfire> you have to scramble to get the items you think you can fuck others over with
[0:32:57] <Prevot> whats woolie even talking about
[0:33:08] <invisi_bliss> that jetpack needs to go
[0:33:10] <+CAPSLOCKlive> It... has... BEGUN

[0:33:22] <Triplicat> lmao holed
[0:33:22] <%RioGascar> Hes talking about a mode where you each place down an item 1 by 1
[0:33:23] <DedlokPM> Jetpack makes it too easy
[0:33:29] <Solidnick18> oh i see the bullshit
[0:33:39] <Graxe_> Turns is on if you do shared couch mode, right?
[0:33:46] <Graxe_> Because it assumes one controller
[0:34:01] <+CAPSLOCKlive> "Its much more fucking" - Woolie MAdden 2020
[0:34:06] <ConeCorvid> feels more like horse
[0:34:18] <Dragon_Batman> It's the same thing just a race
[0:34:19] <Solidnick18> oh no
[0:34:21] <Prevot> so woolie wants the less fun version
[0:34:23] <Thunderhog> @ConeCorvid It's why the game's called chikcen horse
[0:34:25] <dapperskeleton69> who's who
[0:34:34] <Darkrenai> Oh jeez
[0:34:38] <%Irridium> jesus christ
[0:34:40] <+gryffon95> well now its impossible
[0:34:42] <dapperskeleton69> which one is which player
[0:34:43] <+gryffon95> or damn near*
[0:34:44] <Thunderhog> Wooli's racoon, Mihn's sheep, Reg's horse
[0:34:45] <ConeCorvid> @thunderhog yep...
[0:34:49] <%gatorafan> Good Luck!
[0:34:52] <+Sartastic> naaah
[0:34:53] <Graxe_> No one likes sheep
[0:34:57] <Graxe_> Sheep is a good boy
[0:35:03] <+Sartastic> nice
[0:35:05] <DedlokPM> okay. jetpack virtually elimnated
[0:35:06] <+Jake_Protagonist> Totoally doable
[0:35:14] <DovaDude29> Rabbit is best
[0:35:17] <Vigogs> it's SO doable
[0:35:20] <Graxe_> This is a good first game
[0:35:20] <+gryffon95> @Graxe_ but what about rabbit?
[0:35:23] <Dragon_Batman> One of these days the explosives will come in
[0:35:29] <Graxe_> Rabbit is okay

[0:35:49] <yoshkosh20> somethin tells me this game is a friendship ender
[0:35:51] <Graxe_> Could be a fighting game
[0:35:55] <MayorRev> idk why I thought it was fighting games
[0:35:55] <invisi_bliss> jetpack needs to gtfo
[0:35:56] <%GraceTBM> yeah maybe turns is best cuase you can do bombs more readily
[0:35:59] <%chronoxgp> Is this a stand?
[0:35:59] <+Dr_Mooose> jetpack is coward strat
[0:36:02] <Solidnick18> huh
[0:36:03] <Graxe_> Ultimate Chicken Horse: For Glory
[0:36:22] <Prevot> where the bombs at
[0:36:32] <+CAPSLOCKlive> if someone takes the jetpack out they are SOL
[0:36:34] <dapperskeleton69> raccoon ate shit
[0:36:35] <Graxe_> Odd how there's no bombs
[0:36:39] <zenith0111> Ultimate Chicken Horse PogChamp
[0:36:40] <%RioGascar> I think bombs only happen if level cant be complete
[0:36:40] <Graxe_> There it is
[0:36:49] <+gryffon95> jetpack needs to go :P
[0:36:52] <Graxe_> Well
[0:37:00] <Graxe_> Dynamite hit nothing
[0:37:06] <JaseAdrift> nice job mihn
[0:37:09] <artificiallynatural> to blow up an object mihn
[0:37:17] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think he realized it needs to be on something
[0:37:19] <Solidnick18> i don't if you can get in
[0:37:25] <Solidnick18> oh
[0:37:32] <dapperskeleton69> this is literal RNG now
[0:37:44] <niteshade7> Chat should help control the items
[0:37:51] <%chronoxgp> how does the game know you can still reach the flag?
[0:38:03] <+gryffon95> its not rng. and it doesnt
[0:38:04] <dapperskeleton69> if anyone reaches the flag its doable
[0:38:14] <zenith0111> There are some rounds where you get nothing but bombs if the stage is extra cluttered
[0:38:40] <%RioGascar> I think game gives bomb if no one completes level
[0:38:41] <dapperskeleton69> this is undoable
[0:38:52] <%chronoxgp> thank god
[0:38:53] <%RioGascar> Is that a nuke
[0:38:59] <Vyneci> This is actually impossible now LUL
[0:39:02] <%chronoxgp> i want to see them die
[0:39:04] <Thunderhog> Even if the stage is undoable, thats where dynamite comes in
[0:39:06] <+gryffon95> yeah now its impossible
[0:39:12] <dapperskeleton69> woolie killed both of them LUL
[0:39:19] <Thunderhog> ...so long as they stop setting it like traps
[0:39:25] <Dragon_Batman> Well the point is to make it still doable to win
[0:39:26] <spawnzie> the barbs make it impossible
[0:39:33] <Solidnick18> 2 turns left
[0:39:43] <Mvrdok_> Maybe postmortem with the barbwire and the jetpack LUL
[0:39:52] <Mvrdok_> Nevermind LUL
[0:39:53] <+gryffon95> the jetpack still makes it too easy
[0:40:05] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[0:40:11] <+CAPSLOCKlive> jepack got to go
[0:40:14] <dapperskeleton69> minh touches the one bad spot
[0:40:16] <Graxe_> Couch mode on?
[0:40:19] <Solidnick18> jetpack cowards
[0:40:29] <Graxe_> And just pass the controller
[0:40:32] <spawnzie> No jet packs
[0:40:34] <Dragon_Batman> Now do it without the jetpacks
[0:41:09] <%GraceTBM> all you had to do was turn off party you can stay on your own controllers
[0:41:19] <lambishly> ^
[0:41:22] <+mitchteck> “Y Y X X Y Y RB” (Xbox controller) “Triangle Triangle Square Square Triangle Triangle R1” (PS4 controller)
[0:41:24] <%RioGascar> but woolie wants 1 item at a time
[0:41:24] <Orenjevel> turn based VS real time with paws
[0:41:32] <%GraceTBM> yeah woolie just pick a level
[0:41:36] <dapperskeleton69> omg this menu is cute but man navigating it is wack
[0:41:37] <zenith0111> Woolie over thought it LUL
[0:41:40] <Darkrenai> Someone instruct them on how to do one item at a time
[0:41:40] <%wujak> party mode is fine. its just the jetpack at the start that made things weird
[0:41:41] <@Solidus_113> "shared controller"
[0:41:43] <%GraceTBM> it's the SHARED CONTROLLER couch
[0:41:52] <%GraceTBM> Did your eyes work back then
[0:41:53] <+Reveresao> !uptime
[0:41:53] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 52 minutes and 17 seconds
[0:42:12] <%GraceTBM> Why do you want to pass one controller around????
[0:42:15] <Orenjevel> horse is alive
[0:42:17] <Prevot> why would you not wanna play party mode
[0:42:23] <%GraceTBM> Woolie still can't read
[0:42:27] <%RioGascar> Grace the game worked differently
[0:42:30] <InXplotch> The shared controller couch means you pass the controller around
[0:42:40] <+MrTAteMyBalls> does the "Party Mode" button at the top not have an impact on the mode?
[0:42:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1214757122967318529?s=19
[0:42:48] <CrimsonCore90> So is Woolie the Horse?
[0:42:57] <Dragon_Batman> You should be able to set what items show up too
[0:42:59] <+gryffon95> their all the horse
[0:43:20] <Solidnick18> ok now i remember
[0:43:21] <Vigogs> someone let them know that getting the yellow glue on both a stationary object and a moving one will link both objects and they'll move together
[0:43:22] <Graxe_> Party mode is fun, but it's not good to learn stuff
[0:43:29] <dapperskeleton69> woolie raccoon minh chicken reggie horse
[0:43:44] <%GraceTBM> apologies if i was shouting for no reason, this just looks like he made a big point of sharing the controller
[0:43:46] <%RioGascar> Oh wow they changed the mode for this a ton
[0:43:54] <primaryfire> you can just learn by playing tho
[0:43:57] <Dragon_Batman> I mean all you need to learn is what items do what
[0:43:57] <stormhawk9891> No just throw off the deep end right away
[0:43:59] <+mitchteck> “Y Y X X Y Y RB” (Xbox controller) “Triangle Triangle Square Square Triangle Triangle R1” (PS4 controller)
[0:44:03] <Darkrenai> Can they do turn by turn with their own controllers?
[0:44:11] <sosuke5> that's kinda dumb
[0:44:14] <%GraceTBM> Woolie isn't that what the party button does???
[0:44:31] <zenith0111> Woolie is over thinking LUL
[0:44:32] <ConeCorvid> i swear i've done it that way before, but maybe i'm not remembering right
[0:44:32] <lambishly> @WoolieVersus pretty sure you just do party mode instead of creative and everyone can keep their controllers
[0:44:40] <Mvrdok_> @mitchteck What's that for?
[0:44:41] <%RioGascar> But thats a game mode where as the couch thing is...a style???
[0:44:44] <Prevot> wow this makes this game way less fun
[0:44:45] <lambishly> Last round was set to creative
[0:44:50] <%RioGascar> This menu is reallt fucking confusing
[0:44:53] <DedlokPM> @GraceTBM they had party mode on. that was the all at the same time thing
[0:44:55] <+MrTAteMyBalls> I'm burning my Highlights here but Woolie there's a button at the top left that says Party and you can change the mode there
[0:44:59] <FirearmsInstructor> @WoolieVersus Hey man. How goes?
[0:45:13] <primaryfire> yeah this is not as spicy looking as the default mode
[0:45:15] <Orenjevel> chaos reigns
[0:45:19] <FirearmsInstructor> hey chat
[0:45:20] <+Huderga> that was always the normal?
[0:45:20] <%Wool> Party Mode is definitely the best way to play
[0:45:32] <Vigogs> it's not salty if it's not party mode
[0:45:32] <Dragon_Batman> I agree
[0:45:42] <Naughta_Noob> Learn by doing, coward!
[0:45:46] <dapperskeleton69> woolie going for the bullshit out the gate
[0:45:47] <%RioGascar> if someone can go back to the old video on the channel where they play this
[0:46:03] <RioGascar> we might be able to figure out what the hell they did
[0:46:07] <Dragon_Batman> I see Minh is a no fuck you kinda of guy
[0:46:12] <Prevot> if this was the default this game would never have gotten big
[0:46:32] <Dragon_Batman> I think he played it at pax like years ago
[0:47:02] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus I believe you can turn party mode on if you want to coordinate a small cut/pause
[0:47:16] <Graxe_> This was how it was at the start of the video, and then they turned on party mode later in the old video
[0:47:22] <invisi_bliss> too much choice ruins the fun, less improvising involved

[1:07:56] <+DailyOkami> they all need to pick a level
[1:08:10] <+MrTAteMyBalls> yeah just play the game, game's fine this way
[1:08:13] <zenith0111> I saw a lock symbol on the menu. Maybe he locked it?
[1:08:16] <CirclesForever> this is that duck game right
[1:08:16] <+gryffon95> each character votes for a map you know
[1:08:21] <DovaDude29> ROOFTOPS
[1:08:23] <+gryffon95> so if you wanted o
[1:08:35] <+gryffon95> to choose between multiple maps id would spin the weel
[1:08:59] <Dragon_Batman> This game is marvelous in party mode
[1:09:02] <Solidnick18> i think the couch is the right way
[1:09:08] <%RioGascar> This menu is both super cool and a fucking mess
[1:09:19] <primaryfire> it's meant to be more chaotic and force weird builds and improvisation but it's fine to turn the game into somethind ifferent
[1:09:26] <Prevot> turn based is super boring
[1:09:32] <Graxe_> Does Creative enforce turns or no?
[1:09:40] <Graxe_> Or does it need the couch?
[1:09:56] <DovaDude29> Just play party
[1:09:58] <worldbrand> I thought the PJSalt was the point
[1:10:01] <%wujak> pretty sure most the problems come from the fact that woolie prefers a weird side mode than the intended ones
[1:10:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Remember, we play games woolieFUN
[1:10:15] <Memdosu> party mode has more salt tbh

[1:15:13] <%RioGascar> Chaos is a ladder
[1:15:15] <zenith0111> HOW DID FUCK THAT UP
[1:15:29] <%king_wragles> So the chameleon is actually invisible to Minh
[1:15:39] <%jinking79> tell someone with colorbind your color
[1:15:42] <zenith0111> Oh wait what LUL
[1:15:47] <%AKPC_> did minh pray to tzeentch for that one!!!
[1:15:49] <Vyneci> I think it's like a half-victory
[1:15:49] <Mvrdok_> Postmortem is a bonus
[1:16:04] <Dragon_Batman> Not invisible but just harder to see
[1:16:09] <Thunderhog> Also for those who aren't familiar with this game, the PC version of this game has twitch intergration for party mode to influence what items they get in the box
[1:16:31] <Naughta_Noob> Postmortem is a consolation prize
[1:16:50] <Mvrdok_> @WoolieVersus You can customize your characters, maybe it can help Minh
[1:16:51] <ChansonNoire> ?????????
[1:16:53] <ZippyPsycho> No
[1:16:53] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> No it doesn't
[1:16:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> ??????
[1:16:57] <NeroInfinite> ???
[1:16:58] <+PixJames> Ball has to cross the line Woolie your mad
[1:16:59] <ZippyPsycho> The ball has the cross the line
[1:17:00] <NeroInfinite> No
[1:17:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The ball has to cross the line.
[1:17:06] <SLVRBAKSLPZ> the ball has to
[1:17:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yes you can.
[1:17:11] <zenith0111> OMG they don't know football LUL
[1:17:13] <$LiquidShake83> wrong
[1:17:14] <NeroInfinite> Ball has to cross linemate
[1:17:16] <+PixJames> Nah thats rugby woolie you idiot
[1:17:18] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus it's the ball, has to make it past the pylons on the corner. OR it can touch the pylon
[1:17:24] <Ion_Laser> ^
[1:17:24] <+Polter_ge1st> They dont know lol
[1:17:25] <%RioGascar> Wasnt woolie in football for years
[1:17:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You're thinking of rugby.
[1:17:27] <+gryffon95> their in canada. remember. football isnt that well known
[1:17:29] <$LiquidShake83> lol
[1:17:32] <+PixJames> yeah woolie played O line right?
[1:17:36] <NeroInfinite> They doon't know how American footballw orks
[1:17:48] <Ion_Laser> @gryffon95 They do have the CFL there
[1:17:49] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Nope the ball just needs to cross the line
[1:17:52] <+PixJames> Maybe CFL is different?!
[1:17:54] <dapperskeleton69> fucking CANUCKS
[1:17:58] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus ball has to be in the end zone, BUT you have to have control of the ball. Play goes on until you either kneel or fall
[1:17:58] <Ion_Laser> CFL is the same
[1:17:59] <NeroInfinite> HahaBall HahaBall
[1:18:03] <+Darren716> Didnt Woolie play football?
[1:18:06] <+gryffon95> @Ion_Laser you say that like most people arnt watching hockey
[1:18:08] <%jinking79> ppl still remember that time Woolie killed that guy in Football
[1:18:17] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[1:18:31] <NeroInfinite> Remeber that time woolie said he played football but it was actually soccer?
[1:18:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:18:39] <+gryffon95> @Ion_Laser i live in canada so.... :I
[1:18:54] <%king_wragles> THE RABBIT IS A ROBOT
[1:18:59] <+Caped_Eggy> On the bounce
[1:19:02] <Ion_Laser> @gryffon95 ok. So the CFL is a niche thing
[1:19:10] <%RioGascar> I think there is a way for them to get couch + party
[1:19:15] <dapperskeleton69> AGENT OF CHAOS
[1:19:21] <NeroInfinite> CHAOS
[1:19:29] <%RioGascar> the gmae mode DOES lock itself but woolie can force change the mode in the game pause menu
[1:19:32] <DedlokPM> CHAOS rooH
[1:19:37] <dapperskeleton69> I CAN DO ANYTHING PowerUpL EntropyWins PowerUpR
[1:19:38] <+gryffon95> @Ion_Laser pretty much, their still trying to push it, but yeah. Most people go to hockey games, or watch most stuff in the bars. but i could be wrong
[1:20:08] <zenith0111> LUL
[1:20:34] <dapperskeleton69> eyyyyyy!
[1:20:43] <zenith0111> Holy shit a whole line up
[1:20:56] <%AKPC_> noice
[1:21:08] <%king_wragles> Rabbit is robot
[1:21:14] <dapperskeleton69> robbit
[1:21:17] <%king_wragles> Look at rabbit bot!
[1:21:21] <DedlokPM> Rabbot
[1:21:26] <zenith0111> Rabi
[1:21:30] <+gryffon95> stick it to something
[1:21:37] <Hammatime8> Put honey on a moving thing and you can glue something else to it.
[1:21:40] <+gryffon95> it rotates them
[1:21:50] <DedlokPM> CHAOS rooH
[1:21:53] <NeroInfinite> Fuck you figure it out
[1:21:59] <%king_wragles> It is not impossible to play the level without extra turns
[1:22:05] <zenith0111> Use the box platform for an easy point LUL
[1:22:07] <%king_wragles> *now impossible
[1:22:18] <%Wool> oh are they still not playing on Party mode
[1:22:26] <dapperskeleton69> woolie stabbing himself LUL
[1:22:27] <Graxe_> Couch locks to Creative mode
[1:22:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Of course, now I know.
[1:22:31] <Graxe_> Unless something changed
[1:22:33] <BallerSwagBro9k> oh dayum
[1:22:34] <Graxe_> In a patch
[1:22:34] <%RioGascar> They are possibly locked out of party
[1:22:44] <%RioGascar> but i might have workaround
[1:22:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> Mihn Rage
[1:22:57] <%RioGascar> the pause menu allows you to change the game mode to anything you want
[1:23:02] <%king_wragles> HAH, @WoolieVersus glassed himself
[1:23:03] <@Solidus_113> Shin Minh
[1:23:09] <dapperskeleton69> holy shit reggie
[1:23:10] <DedlokPM> @Wool 1st playthrough was party, then they did couch, and decided all at once was too chaotic
[1:23:11] <NeroInfinite> NICE
[1:23:13] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> WREKT
[1:23:18] <%RioGascar> so MAYBE they can change the game mode that way
[1:23:19] <Graxe_> Party Mode + turns is the ideal for this session, I think?
[1:23:26] <zenith0111> Underdog Chicken PogChamp
[1:23:48] <%RioGascar> woolie wants the slow chaos
[1:23:53] <+gralho> pior Mike chan
[1:24:06] <Graxe_> The jet pack was right there at the bottom, wasn't it?
[1:24:06] <DedlokPM> @Graxe_turns + individual controllers/no controllers is their ideal
[1:24:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's a fire hydrant.
[1:24:41] <Dragon_Batman> The animation kinda was literal
[1:24:43] <DedlokPM> @Graxe_turns er I mean turns + individual controllers/no controllers is their ideal*
[1:24:50] <%RioGascar> but the way the games menus are designed are really really frustrating
[1:25:37] <dapperskeleton69> HEADSHOT
[1:25:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1214757122967318529?s=19
[1:26:08] <%RioGascar> A version of this with party mode would just solve the issues
[1:26:13] <Frostilk> Ah, the soulsborne approach
[1:26:20] <Dragon_Batman> Aaay Minhs thinking
[1:26:23] <%RioGascar> cause then they get some items to pick but not infinity
[1:26:43] <%RioGascar> This is the way
[1:26:53] <NeroInfinite> A buncha things but no platforms
[1:26:59] <Solidnick18> ride the box
[1:27:03] <zenith0111> "It's a robot..." "He or she... " LUL
[1:27:10] <Solidnick18> i see the path

[1:30:32] <Solidnick18> maybe it's extra points?
[1:30:37] <dapperskeleton69> it is
[1:30:44] <Graxe_> There's two kinds of jet packs
[1:30:49] <NeroInfinite> coin is extra points
[1:30:50] <Graxe_> One respawns and one is one-time use
[1:31:11] <%RioGascar> Chaos chaos
[1:31:11] <DedlokPM> @Solidnick18 coin is extra points, but they were talking about the jetpack being a consumable/1 time useable
[1:31:16] <zenith0111> Minh getting heated LUL
[1:31:18] <Graxe_> Woolie gonna go 2-0

[1:32:14] <%RioGascar> evo19GG
[1:32:16] <Graxe_> That slow salt
[1:32:24] <chiazam> Are they not doing random constructs???
[1:32:30] <zenith0111> This stage is great
[1:32:39] <Thunderhog> Couch locks you to this
[1:32:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:32:47] <NeroInfinite> WAit I think I know what Reggie is doing...it's that multi dimensional sniping shit
[1:32:58] <%RioGascar> the slow salt is what makes this good but they do need to be able lock down items they can select each turn
[1:33:15] <Graxe_> Yeah, full book is a bit much
[1:33:15] <+DeathRube> woolie how?
[1:33:21] <Graxe_> Because bombs every turn
[1:33:24] <DedlokPM> @NeroInfinite yeah, but in order to do his plan Woolie can't get get to goal
[1:33:33] <NeroInfinite> ah true.
[1:33:33] <DedlokPM> because he will have enought to win
[1:33:51] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus i think i might have a workaround and still allow couch play. the game locks itself to creative on couch BUT the games pause menu does not, you MIGHT be able to select party mode while in couch
[1:33:52] <Dragon_Batman> He just needs to force no points
[1:33:57] <DedlokPM> so he basically wasted his turn for nothing
[1:34:06] <chiazam> Imo all at the same time is better
[1:34:07] <DedlokPM> Or not LUL
[1:34:13] <Dalkalopagus> there does end up being a mutually assured destruction thing with the full book, because if one person keeps using bombs, everyone will and then nothing gets done

[1:44:38] <Ion_Laser> @Solidus_113 Make steak fries. There's gonna be a lot of salt
[1:44:38] <%RioGascar> couch mode + party is interesting but game locks you to creative in couch mode
[1:44:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Isn't it the first person who builds?
[1:44:51] <coldinnovation> when you think about it. isnt every multiplayer game a fighting game in the end

[1:59:32] <@akuda_bar> it's a corkscrew
[1:59:43] <SixthSun2> You get one clip, Woolie
[1:59:47] <+b_bang_> think it depends on the gun
[1:59:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @WoolieVersus If a gun can reload, it'll reload when you press the fire button.
[1:59:56] <SixthSun2> LUL

[2:00:14] <%RioGascar> You can reload the pistol its just a flintlock and slow
[2:00:18] <Graxe_> Yeah, ammo depends on the gun
[2:00:29] <dapperskeleton69> it aint godhand if you arent hearing BUUURRRRN every ten seconds
[2:00:30] <+CarlosEoM> LUL

[2:01:41] <+Despera__> Fedora and the katana
[2:01:48] <%RioGascar> man what if the goose got in here as a crossover
[2:01:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Both Untitled Goose Game and Duck Game understand the important of a dedicated Avian Audio button.
[2:01:56] <dapperskeleton69> NOTHIN PERSONEL WAK
[2:02:00] <blue6sub6remnant6> <Minh's duck is yellow. Reggie's duck is black and Woolie's is white.> The game is subtly pushing a strange race narrative.
[2:02:09] <illegal_characters> first to 10 boys
[2:02:19] <%RioGascar> duck race war
[2:02:21] <zaqir13> lol
[2:02:21] <%Wool> @blue6sub6remnant6 WOOLIE MADDEN SO WHITE
[2:02:22] <DedlokPM> @blue6sub6remnant6 LUL
[2:02:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @blue6sub6remnant6 The implications of that last part are both very troubling and hilarious.
[2:02:23] <Solidnick18> FIYA

[2:02:55] <Graxe_> So you need to pick up keys
[2:02:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bumblelord
[2:02:58] <+YabbaTroll> gonna go through em all
[2:03:18] <+Javaa01> Minimal safe distance is more then just a suggestion
[2:03:21] <dapperskeleton69> duck suicide the game
[2:03:21] <SixthSun2> Who knew a guy from Grenada would have trouble with grenades
[2:03:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is it Duck game where the grenades actually have the blast radius close to a real grenade? Why is Duck game the one that gets that right?
[2:03:49] <illegal_characters> Once I played this game and a glitch gave my friend two ducks per round
[2:04:04] <illegal_characters> it became an action puzzle torture device
[2:04:05] <zaqir13> get the flower
[2:04:08] <%RioGascar> ...commander it doesnt even have shrapnel
[2:04:15] <%RioGascar> Which i think no game has
[2:04:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @thatWaulfyguy They told you that, but they were actually using the Virgil hat with doppelganger.
[2:04:32] <%RioGascar> cause it would be too horroriffic
[2:04:34] <dapperskeleton69> reggie is the only one winning
[2:04:44] <dapperskeleton69> minh keeps suiciding and woolie is confused
[2:04:56] <Nameless0100> lol
[2:05:07] <%RioGascar> Is screenCheat on ps4?
[2:05:20] <zaqir13> its a mine not a ball
[2:05:22] <%RioGascar> Cause THAT one is salt
[2:05:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dapperskeleton69 "The Woolie hurt itself in his confusion."
[2:05:27] <Nameless0100> The best weapon is the Bible
[2:05:46] <anarchistPastry> we playin Stick Fight later?
[2:05:48] <DedlokPM> Some fries, mother fucker. mogsQuack

[2:07:12] <%RioGascar> But if so i got stick fight installed
[2:07:13] <+YabbaTroll> snipe is armor penetrating
[2:07:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can you do online lobbies in Stick Fight?
[2:07:23] <DedlokPM> I think because it was the sniper that it went through
[2:07:23] <illegal_characters> @CommanderSqueaks if that was the case I'm pretty sure he didn't realize it either, that'd be a pretty bad bit to never reveal

[2:51:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also Solidus, did you know this was going to happen already? That was TOO on point.
[2:51:41] <yoshkosh20> oh shit. didn't realize this game was that old
[2:52:18] <+Darren716> @WoolieVersus Hey quick heads up for wrestling news, you are going to see some articles saying La Parka has passed away, this is not the La Parka you are likely familiar with from WCW, different guy
[2:52:31] <Aussie_Manny> GRAPPLE AWAY
[2:52:31] <blue6sub6remnant6> So it's Mirror's Edge meets Smash. Got it.

[2:55:42] <Aussie_Manny> The Incredibles soundtrack tho. LUL
[2:55:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> So what I'm seeing is Woolie thrives in games that let you plan every step, Minh thrives in absolute chaos, and Reggie thrives in a median between the two.

[2:56:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Lawful Woolie, Chaotic Minh and Neutral Reggie
