[0:01:37] <%DatAsuna> It's their metroid self destruct run
[0:01:43] <%Chatterbox1991> THAT WARTHOG THO
[0:01:50] <sileo_patronus> I think Halo 1 has better context for the level reuse though
[0:01:54] <%ALTRNico> so Halo is DMC4 of videogames>
[0:01:55] <+Snipershot489> John Halo

[0:03:19] <DWAP> There's a two season radio play for halo 5 that has no relevance to the plot of halo 5 because they threw out the plot it was based on
[0:03:20] <coughman> Funfact: In the Halo universe, we did develop energy weapons, but we stuck with physical bullets cuz they were more satisfying
[0:03:23] <%DatAsuna> When's spartan assault? xD

[0:12:21] <+masked_hero_lucky> Super Paper Mario is good, just not as good as TTYD
[0:12:21] <PhantomMaskJr> thuluLASH3 tsbDrip
[0:12:23] <+thunka10> FINE! I WILL fight you
[0:12:24] <@Menitta> SPM's OST is easily the best thing of that game
[0:12:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Thats how u recommend a game
[0:12:26] <powerprotoman> so how far in the distance is digimon cyber sleuth from the end of thousand year door

[0:13:09] <maple26> i wish to not be dissapointed
[0:13:11] <%chosenjuan42> SMP has an amazing story & great characters

[0:17:23] <+lioan515> FEED BLASTOISE
[0:17:27] <sagemodeanon> Reggies 1000yr stare
[0:17:28] <Deadmanslegacy> darkness 2 was a hell of lot better than 1, game play in 1 was wonky and terrible.
[0:17:30] <%DatAsuna> It's not a fair comparison because option A is one game, option B is a whole genre
[0:17:30] <%FenixSeraph> FenixSeraph subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Thanks for all the good streams and content Woolie, I hope you keep on going strong and making good content that cheers me and others up especially in wake of all the shit rocking the videogame streaming and FGC communities at the moment
[0:17:31] <Shardlab> Fate is something best watched, because their games have garbage gameplay
[0:17:32] <SilverFaustX> fallout is getting a tv series
[0:17:32] <+XenoDandelion> FGO lingers

[0:17:34] <therealslimskippy> @WoolieVersus fate/stay night is a good visual novel. the prequel fate/zero is also fucking incredible
[0:17:35] <+valkuma> you mean Ong ?
[0:17:35] <+masked_hero_lucky> League has a whole system for getting free skins, but the skins you get for free are totally random
[0:17:35] <%ZeroNoHikari> Smite Avatar is a battle pass my dude
[0:17:35] <pixel_river> Faate gran order is based on Fate Stay night an adult visual novel for windeows
[0:17:37] <%eanscrale> I say that as someone who can't stand moba
[0:17:39] <Daniel_Is_I> Dota 2 gives you all heroes for free.
[0:17:39] <StarlitStunner> Chat is acting like Pat lytWINCE
[0:17:40] <polarix220> Don't walk straight into the hell that is FGO
[0:17:41] <+hatok> you can play Dissidia Opera Omnia without paying, it's the only gacha for humans
[0:17:41] <+linSP> woolie would pick dota for sure
[0:17:41] <critiquequartz> It’s too late Woolie asked so we’re here

[0:20:42] <%Superbro64> LET WOOLIE PLAY THE GAME FIRST GUYS
[0:20:44] <%dinnydanny777> There sure is a live action movie of Halo
[0:20:47] <heart_ablaze> I like uncle kicks
[0:20:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> Remember the unist stream where Reggie wanted Wagner to stomp his face in?
[0:20:49] <%psidefx> Reggie: The Dragon of Toe-Jima
[0:20:53] <Zeif00> The Halo anime movies ye
[0:20:54] <%dinnydanny777> There is a live action movie of Halo
[0:20:54] <%SmoothEnigma> Ok yea I'd be cool with Uncle Kicks
[0:20:55] <%DexusJik> DexusJik subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:20:56] <ChocolateMoofin> I've only watched the YouTube so far, how far are we guys?
[0:20:56] <%DatAsuna> I would say 3 is the flootgate for everything
[0:20:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Good anime studios were involved. And Toei too lol
[0:20:58] <+D4C_Trice> Uncle Kicks sounds good
[0:21:02] <sagemodeanon> Uncle Kicks new canonn
[0:21:09] <%LVDoomien> my parents watched the Halo live action thing for some reason I think they thought it was okay
[0:21:09] <Brutalyte616> So if Woolie is Punch Daddy, and Reggie is Kick Daddy, then what the fuck is Minh?
[0:21:10] <XGAShinEdgelord> Hey Woolie!
[0:21:10] <%dinnydanny777> There is a live action movie version of Halo btw, it exists
[0:21:15] <%kyh9> Medabots >>>>>>>> DIGIMON >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Pokemon
[0:21:16] <+thunka10> same
[0:21:17] <%SuperKirby24> I support uncle kicks
[0:21:17] <CyrusVGZ> Why do people keep comparing Pokemon and Digimon? They're not even serving the same niche and I'd argue that they never were.
[0:21:20] <XGAShinEdgelord> First time viewer of your Twitch channel
[0:21:20] <%SirGO0SE> same, sometimes i look at memes from the time it came out too LUL

[0:21:26] <Meltgar> Medabots 1 or Season 2?
[0:21:26] <%LVDoomien> @kyh9 GO GET YOUR FRIENDS

[0:21:36] <HelluvaNohbody> Gotta get through 79-cca before the ovas
[0:21:36] <+lioan515> Haruhi in release order is suffering dont @ me
[0:21:37] <glass_marcus> They both end with the suffix Mon
[0:21:37] <KeiPrime> release order always
[0:21:39] <nyacoo> @CyrusVGZ Marketing in the US I assume?
[0:21:41] <MasterGeneralVic> Min was sacrificed after Dokkapon kingdom Fact!
[0:21:46] <bbblaketwitching> that sounds like foreshadowing
[0:21:47] <%kyh9> @LVDoomien I didn't know this but Medabots started as an RPG series before it was an anime
[0:21:49] <+tearfuldevil> @Brutalyte616 uncle eyeballs
[0:21:52] <therealslimskippy> @WoolieVersus people who don't understand when you're supposed to watch sequels make me SO MAD. it's still a sequel because the creator plays with your expectations
[0:21:52] <OperatorJo_> Halo has some good shit in it, but it desperately dropped the ball after 4 NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:21:58] <%LVDoomien> I miss Medabots
[0:22:03] <therealslimskippy> *prequels
[0:22:05] <+steelmorrigan> Thanks for the PrideFloat @re4lion95
[0:22:06] <GenericSoda> oh this is a VERY big thing with Yakuza 0
[0:22:09] <Talinu> Haruhi chronological order also works because that's the order of the books. The broadcast order is artistic discretion.
[0:22:09] <+JoeTierGod> Paramedic talking about Godzilla

[0:22:39] <%re4lion95> np love my canadian bro
[0:22:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Yakuza 0 is the exception to this imo
[0:22:46] <%Tuna_Can_0> @WoolieVersus How do you feel about binge watching as opposed to what the original release was. If it was weekly or w/e
[0:22:48] <PsycoZaku> that movie about the prawns section 13 or whatever was supposed to be a halo movie but it got canned in the process. some of the weapons were reused
[0:22:49] <Prevot> Yakuza 0 is actually better if you don't know
[0:22:49] <%Irridium> release order best order
[0:22:50] <%LVDoomien> breaking news ghislaine maxwelll has mysteriously died
[0:22:50] <crunkers_> woolie what's your opinion on the back seat gaming that happens in chat?
[0:22:51] <Brutalyte616> @tearfuldevil and what about V?
[0:22:51] <bbblaketwitching> well, clearly that thing is significant for the future though? Isn't that functional?
[0:22:55] <greynob> reeeBrr
[0:22:56] <CyrusVGZ> Pokemon and Digimon are like Kamen Rider and Super Sentai. They're adjacent but comparing them is dumb.
[0:23:01] <%FenixSeraph> Yakuza 0 is incredible
[0:23:02] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:23:06] <%DatAsuna> Yakzua 0 is a great game but an awful prequel
[0:23:09] <+tearfuldevil> @Brutalyte616 Uncle Guitar
[0:23:11] <+steelmorrigan> Yakuza 0 is great
[0:23:11] <heart_ablaze> it is
[0:23:12] <Solidnick18> it's great place to start
[0:23:12] <%Lion_kun> You literally spend 10 seconds on Kiryu's coat
[0:23:14] <coughman> there is ONE reference in Y0 that you wont get, but its very minor
[0:23:14] <Zebroneath> There are few exceptions to the rule. It all depends, really.
[0:23:15] <+djinnJuice> La li lu le lo?
[0:23:15] <CastellanVon> Yakuza 0 was made to be a new beginning for people to get in.
[0:23:20] <Nekros4442> Yakuza is the best start point in the series. No contest
[0:23:20] <Prevot> it makes the first game story better if you start with 0
[0:23:21] <+lioan515> Start and end at yakuza 0
[0:23:24] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus That said, yakuzo 0 gameplaywise actually kinda ruins playing yakuza 1/kiwami right after it
[0:23:24] <Nekros4442> "Yakuza 0"
[0:23:25] <%FenixSeraph> there's some mentions to later games that have more impact if you know what happened, but it's mostly self enclosed
[0:23:27] <%LVDoomien> I still need to finish Kiwami 1
[0:23:28] <Solidnick18> it's before anything happens in 1
[0:23:29] <$BallerSwagBro9k> The problem with 0 is that everything after is less good
[0:23:32] <%jiggy_snipe> people also say Yakuza 1 Kiwami is lacking compared to 0
[0:23:36] <KeiPrime> i mean you wont recognize a lot of stuff in 0 but its not major
[0:23:37] <MasterGeneralVic> told before the main story Yakuza 0 is one of the best game's at naritve structure
[0:23:40] <HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus GOD DAMN MAGICIANS NEPHEW
[0:23:41] <%infinite_rotation> PogChamp500 howdy woolz, have you ever tried any of the mario and luigi games? Its a shame alpha dream had to go bankrupt but the mario and luigi games, bowsers inside story especially, will aways live on as some of my favorite games.
[0:23:41] <Zayasu> i played them all except 6 and love 0 the most
[0:23:42] <%infinite_rotation> infinite_rotation's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[0:23:44] <%gatorafan> Kiwami means EXTREME daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:23:45] <Tommylippert> Do the out of 100 trials
[0:23:46] <GenericSoda> @coughman there is a sidequest that literally explains the hook the every other game released at the time tho
[0:23:47] <CastellanVon> Kiwami's not great honestly. But Kiwami 2 is really good.
[0:23:48] <polarix220> Yakuza 0 is a decent start point but I still think you should start with 1 on the PS2
[0:23:48] <%DatAsuna> The majima anywhere system actually ruins kiwami
[0:23:50] <Tommylippert> Pit
[0:23:53] <niozonbi> Thanks for the PrideWorld @infinite_rotation
[0:24:00] <+dukeofhammer> they remade the first two games after zero with references too it. So its basically become the new inteded order
[0:24:03] <+Grayhammatter> kiwami means EXTREME
[0:24:04] <%doomerskeletor13> I think 0s story works better if you don’t know the future
[0:24:07] <+zooeymainbtw> good stuff
[0:24:24] <%LVDoomien> ok boomer
[0:24:27] <Solidnick18> wait
[0:24:27] <%Lion_kun> You can start with Yakuza 0 but there are camera focuses on certain future events

[0:24:46] <+AJiiij> ppl dont know what milleenial means
[0:24:47] <%psidefx> Post 2000 Gen Z
[0:24:47] <+TheRisingPride> Millineal is a pretty large bracket
[0:24:48] <+Grayhammatter> we're all boomers down here
[0:24:49] <%jiggy_snipe> Millenials are almost 40 btw
[0:24:50] <%DatAsuna> No millennial is post 2000
[0:24:50] <%LVDoomien> Woolie is older than me therefore he's a boomer
[0:24:54] <slimey0> generations are bullshit
[0:24:54] <%lotharrio> Millenials "came of age" during 2000
[0:24:55] <+Williamld> Born after 96 is zoomer
[0:24:56] <%SuperKirby24> if you werent born before now you're a boomer Kappa
[0:24:56] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BallerSwagBro9k
[0:24:56] <CastellanVon> Most people here are Gen Z.
[0:25:01] <Take1two> millenial ends around 1995
[0:25:02] <jorniev> i live in another country so i just recently found outwhat pro wrestling was
[0:25:03] <%a_goth_pancake> exposed psaLiz
[0:25:04] <%jiggy_snipe> well the oldest millenials I mean
[0:25:04] <%kyh9> All I know is a lot of the big WWE stuff was something I had to catch up on
[0:25:06] <KatabolicRage> Millenial is anything from 1980 to 2000, a "generation" is defined as 20 years
[0:25:10] <Prevot> if you don't remember the days before 911 you're no t a millennial
[0:25:10] <OperatorJo_> Woolie the late boomer
[0:25:11] <+Snipershot489> 2001 here lol
[0:25:18] <noobpsyboticus> your either born a millennial or live long enough to become a boomer
[0:25:18] <+twohitgood> transition from gen x to gen y is between 1981 and 1983.
[0:25:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> The end point of the Boomer Era is retroactively advancing forwards, like the Langoliers. It will eventually consume us all.
[0:25:20] <%iHum4n> I the millennial generation ends in the mid 90s?
[0:25:22] <CirclesForever> Anyone born between 1981 and 1996
[0:25:23] <KatabolicRage> anything after 2000 gets into gen y and z
[0:25:25] <exnuart> 95
[0:25:25] <therealslimskippy> my metric is if you remember 9/11 you're a millennial

[0:30:58] <maple26> The 2020 shitshow continues taking whatever it wants and making you suspicious of anyone in a high up position because if they're trending on twitter it's probably for something scummy
[0:30:59] <@Commando_Joe> Bizzarnage. Bizzaro and Carnage
[0:31:03] <%doomerskeletor13> You can tell the X-Men were huge in the 90s because a lot of the fusions were X characters

[0:32:04] <heart_ablaze> flash batman and green lantern batman from dark metal is rad
[0:32:04] <%RadicalWeegee> They are FAAANTASTIC!!!
[0:32:06] <%SomersaultJustice> superstar saga and inside story are good
[0:32:07] <%SirGO0SE> theyre pretty great, for me they were the best follow up to this game
[0:32:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BIS was the shit
[0:32:09] <%DatAsuna> the batman who pogs
[0:32:10] <bbblaketwitching> I dont know who Dark Claw is, but it sounds edgy
[0:32:12] <%RadicalWeegee> Highly recomend them <3
[0:32:14] <%Wool> BIS is super fucking good
[0:32:16] <+AJiiij> first 3 are are great
[0:32:16] <JetpackMcQuack> The vore game
[0:32:16] <mothdude> Superstar Saga and Bowser's Inside Story were the best ones.
[0:32:17] <maple26> the batman behind the slaughter
[0:32:18] <Prevot> superstar saga and Bowser's inside story are godlike
[0:32:18] <andrex2311> the Mario&Luigi games are really good
[0:32:18] <jorniev> SUPER STAR SAGA IS great
[0:32:19] <GenericSoda> Bowser's Vore Story
[0:32:19] <KishinGrek> Bowsers inside story was lit
[0:32:21] <%jinking79> DC still canon with the crossover with Marvel
[0:32:22] <+lioan515> It is I who nuts to that
[0:32:22] <marvel877> First 3 are good.
[0:32:23] <maple26> SS and BIS are good
[0:32:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I HAVE FURY
[0:32:25] <%SomersaultJustice> there were like 5
[0:32:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:32:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> Which is better, Inside Story or the time one with babies?
[0:32:27] <peanutdot007> Inside Story and Super Star Saga are very good
[0:32:28] <%DatAsuna> Don't forget paper jam :P
[0:32:31] <+TestAnon> I bet it does
[0:32:31] <glass_marcus> BiS> SSS> PIT>DT>PJ
[0:32:32] <+skizzuto> there's five, the first 3-4 were good
[0:32:33] <nyacoo> There's also a Paper Mario crossover
[0:32:36] <skyheys> big vore
[0:32:36] <%Wool> @DatAsuna no
[0:32:36] <+AJiiij> partners in time
[0:32:37] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Oh yeah those are fantastic
[0:32:38] <maple26> no one ever mentions PIT and it never got a remake so nah
[0:32:39] <%notgarza> Alpha Dream lytWAH l lytNOTIKETHIS
[0:32:41] <edward11231> I liked PiT
[0:32:42] <GenericSoda> Inside Story is fucking sick though, absolutely the best characterization of Bowser
[0:32:43] <FacetiousAF> @DatAsuna GTAB DansGame
[0:32:44] <KishinGrek> Paper Jam
[0:32:44] <Meltgar> Those bosses never came back right?
[0:32:45] <%debrv> What have I missed?
[0:32:46] <dizimous> By far one of the best games that also happens to be fetish fuel ever
[0:32:49] <Prevot> Bowser's inside story is my favorite Mario RPG
[0:32:50] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Play those if you get the chance man
[0:32:52] <JetpackMcQuack> bowsers inside vorey
[0:32:54] <+Ben_TheRoadrage_Miller> What's tour favourite goofy french canadian translation of movie titles ?
[0:32:55] <maple26> The Paper Mario Crossover was just Nu Paper Mario stuff so... eh.
[0:33:02] <marvel877> Only played the first one. Still need to play Partners and Bowser's.

[0:33:52] <sagemodeanon> MUH infinite universes
[0:33:53] <%LVDoomien> Bioshock 2 introduced major characters that are nonsensical seeming for them to not have been mentioned in the first game
[0:33:55] <KishinGrek> B2 was bad, escort mission the game

[0:39:48] <Meltgar> Reggie did you got reccomendations on the pieces or asked friends or went blind run?
[0:39:49] <%SirGO0SE> and then get some emotes designed!
[0:39:49] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> vineStahp STAP
[0:39:50] <Nekros4442> 2080 will last you a decade
[0:39:51] <%BisoromiBear> The "Woolie playing an FPS" emote

[0:40:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Reggie's life: NotLikeThis
[0:40:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> Dawg this PC building shit sounds too complicated I'm just gonna buy an Alienware laptop and call it a day. I just wanna play minecraft with mods man
[0:40:11] <bbblaketwitching> can a time traveller just give me a shitty computer from the future please?
[0:40:13] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus everything else should be like $600-700 total
[0:40:15] <%SirGO0SE> its pretty fun tbh
[0:40:19] <silverira> Valeu pelo emote PrideStrong, @heroversusofficial
[0:40:20] <OperatorJo_> that phase never ends
[0:40:22] <%re4lion95> im gonna assume super thats the most common tbh
[0:40:23] <iRobschach> Building a pc is such a liberating and harrowing experience at the same time
[0:40:26] <Deadmanslegacy> console for life
[0:40:29] <%a_goth_pancake> 2080 ti should last a few years m8, you're fone
[0:40:29] <bbblaketwitching> and then it breaks
[0:40:32] <exnuart> alienware is overpriced
[0:40:37] <@Menitta> Yeah Woolie has shown he knows how to drive
[0:40:42] <%debrv> True.
[0:40:44] <+djinnJuice> @fuqboislim that's the way you spend the most possible for the least benefit

[0:41:20] <%doombawkzvs> NotLikeThis
[0:41:25] <+djinnJuice> Branded gaming stuff and gaming laptop is the worst case scenario for value
[0:41:26] <%a_goth_pancake> and then this car has now depreciated in value by $15,000
[0:41:28] <Leafboi125> Buh
[0:41:31] <%SirGO0SE> if you just need case mem power you should come in way under 500 on the remaining parts
[0:41:32] <%DatAsuna> ram and cases are way cheaper
[0:41:32] <Prevot> big shits for big boys
[0:41:32] <OperatorJo_> make sure to not get a cooling system that sounds like it's doing liftoff

[0:42:59] <%a_goth_pancake> bump Lian Li, they look noice
[0:43:01] <%ozzrabbit> Make sure you’re grounding yourself when assembling it, parts are sensitive. Heck, some people assemble computers naked just to be extra safe.
[0:43:05] <audibleellipsis> oh yeah there's a command for that, isn't there
[0:43:06] <+RocketBarrel> 150 for a case seems hella expensive no?
[0:43:08] <%RadicalWeegee> oooooo
[0:43:09] <%DatAsuna> PCUserBenchmark is also very good
[0:43:09] <FoxInABeret> @audibleellipsis Beginning. Gameplay hasn't started yet.
[0:43:11] <Nekros4442> Just saying, it's best if you dont build the computer by yourself if you're going all in on your first PC. Get ur friend to help

[0:55:38] <Brutalyte616> FGO is a timesink that you can try and circumvent by spending money, but it's all about luck and time investment; there is no 'premium status' for Grand Order.

[0:57:06] <+AJiiij> overlay is misaligned

[0:57:29] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Aw shoot, sad I missed that
[0:57:31] <Papa_Bearman> That's bait, dude.
[0:57:32] <%RadicalWeegee> HARD
[0:57:32] <%SomersaultJustice> fixed that HD Gamecube Drift
[0:57:33] <%lotharrio> It's a whatever.
[0:57:35] <A_CD_By_Thomas> It gets real tough later
[0:57:36] <Papa_Bearman> It gets WAY harder.
[0:57:37] <+AbnormalVoid> it gets MUCH HARDER
[0:57:39] <@Menitta> nah its super easy
[0:57:42] <%DatAsuna> It's a lot like that twilight princess pit
[0:57:43] <%SomersaultJustice> it's only the beginning
[0:57:44] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 50 is the WALL
[0:57:45] <+Grayhammatter> it gets tough
[0:57:46] <+linSP> we want to see the whole pit!
[0:57:47] <@Menitta> speedrun that shit
[0:57:47] <boti_balint> no pipe crunch PogChamp
[0:57:48] <polarix220> It gets way harder
[0:57:49] <andrex2311> it get MUCH MUCH HARDER
[0:57:51] <FoxInABeret> 50 onwards is *rough*.
[0:57:51] <TheMrRental> everything before 60 isn't THAT bad
[0:57:52] <+Cecrios> I love my HD Gamecube
[0:57:53] <+AbnormalVoid> lmao @Menitta
[0:57:56] <citerel> later floors are endgame
[0:57:57] <noe_juan_kanobe> The full 100 has spikes
[0:57:58] <SixthSun2> Floor 50 has something good you want to get before the end of the game
[0:58:00] <+xeros720> offhand, i want to say different sets of floors coincide with different parts of the game
[0:58:01] <TheMrRental> 70+ is really crazy
[0:58:03] <Papa_Bearman> There's another trouble later that takes you to Floor 50.
[0:58:03] <%MonsterEnvy> Hey want to smash that switch
[0:58:07] <+Dimfish> later floors are pretty fucked
[0:58:08] <CastellanVon> It's both hard and an endurance run
[0:58:09] <epicbehemoth> wait until you get past 30. those floors are a pain!
[0:58:10] <niozonbi> The floors are scaled by chapter
[0:58:19] <Zalthia> So. What chapter are we on?
[0:58:20] <Papa_Bearman> Oh, you trade Star Pieces for badges?
[0:58:20] <%SmoothEnigma> Woolie. it gets fucking INSANELY hard
[0:58:22] <niozonbi> As in later floors contain enemies from later chapters
[0:58:24] <Daniel_Is_I> Chapter 3
[0:58:26] <Brutalyte616> It's necessary as you soldier on, because the Pit is a fucking m
[0:58:27] <Solidnick18> chapter 3
[0:58:32] <Brutalyte616> marathon.
[0:58:33] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Nice
[0:58:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Poggers
[0:58:37] <+Grayhammatter> clean
[0:58:40] <+xeros720> i forgot there was even side quests in this game
[0:58:43] <Solidnick18> yeee
[0:58:45] <Esparsenior> Neat
[0:58:47] <bbblaketwitching> Did he ever talk to Blooey?
[0:58:48] <%doombawkzvs> Did you upgrade your partners?
[0:58:50] <@akuda_bar> @SmoothEnigma it's not THAT hard.
[0:58:50] <Daniel_Is_I> Pit of 100 Trials floors 90-100 are THE place to grind
[0:58:51] <%razielhex> WEEGEE
[0:58:53] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> Back to Summer slam
[0:58:53] <Papa_Bearman> @bbblaketwitching Yeah.
[0:58:57] <skyheys> rat investment time
[0:58:59] <%SomersaultJustice> ALL BP
[0:59:01] <bbblaketwitching> @papa_bearman ty
[0:59:02] <GHouseduivel> 82 Coins, did you spend some in-between floors
[0:59:02] <maple26> Wario Mario!
[0:59:03] <noe_juan_kanobe> Whatd you get for the trouble?
[0:59:03] <%starzo0> @bbblaketwitching yes
[0:59:06] <%MonsterEnvy> Grinding is not needed
[0:59:08] <andrex2311> BP OR DEATH
[0:59:09] <OperatorJo_> Man living in an era where a friggin' phone can emulate a console perfectly is wild when you think about it.
[0:59:11] <polarix220> If you actually decide to go through all of the pit you need to stream floor 100
[0:59:12] <+Dimfish> bp is the truth of life fam
[0:59:15] <penitentpentwitch> Did they ever go back and tattle "Luigi's Partnern"?
[0:59:15] <boti_balint> ALL IN BP
[0:59:16] <@Menitta> all health Kappa
[0:59:16] <epicbehemoth> pure BP run let's go!!
[0:59:16] <GenericSoda> HAMMERMAN
[0:59:18] <aeugchad> i'm so used to watching vods i forgot this is happening live
[0:59:18] <bbblaketwitching> jumpman is life
[0:59:18] <glass_marcus> HP for cowards
[0:59:20] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Charlieton has a lot of fun dumb badges
[0:59:21] <+StrawberryPantsu> FP>BP>HP
[0:59:22] <%RyTYoung> BP BB
[0:59:22] <crunkers_> do whatever you want in terns of levels
[0:59:22] <+xeros720> seriously, you do want like 25 of each, before total BP
[0:59:30] <TheMrRental> Hammerman and Jumpman are more interesting than danger mario fight me
[0:59:31] <@akuda_bar> not true
[0:59:32] <+zooeymainbtw> im a bp, fp, bp hp
[0:59:32] <%SmoothEnigma> @akuda_bar I mean, from my perspective it is cause I cant block SHIT in this game. only thing I cant learn the timing on
[0:59:32] <%doomerskeletor13> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[0:59:33] <maple26> I have yet to catch one live but here I am! Watching it. Live.
[0:59:36] <Sp3ctre48> BP is more fun
[0:59:36] <+zooeymainbtw> etc etc
[0:59:39] <peanutdot007> BP unlocks cool moves
[0:59:40] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> vineBrainyot
[0:59:41] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yep
[0:59:44] <%DatAsuna> I say you should never have more than 6BP beyond what you can use already
[0:59:44] <%eanscrale> Danger is actually ez mode
[0:59:49] <+AbnormalVoid> @WoolieVersus game is really easy, just BP pump anyway, it's more fun to do more junk
[0:59:53] <+the_krypto_knight> With hp and fp badges worst case scenario you just convert your bp to the other stats you want
[0:59:56] <epicbehemoth> go all in on BP. can't you max out at 64 in this one?
[0:59:57] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus that's not true, no
[1:00:06] <iRobschach> OH SHIT WE DOING GLITZVILLE??
[1:00:06] <Papa_Bearman> @epicbehemoth No, you can max out at 150.
[1:00:08] <Daniel_Is_I> BP pumping is pretty much glass cannon
[1:00:09] <%doombawkzvs> You can clip out of bounds there to get around the fish
[1:00:13] <Brutalyte616> You will respect the BP only run.
[1:00:16] <%RyTYoung> YE GLITZVILLE
[1:00:17] <bbblaketwitching> Danger is very easy if you abuse any other mechanics simultaneously
[1:00:17] <%starzo0> my first time playing i went full bp cause im not a coward
[1:00:17] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah they are
[1:00:18] <+TheRisingPride> Not wrong about that
[1:00:18] <TheMrRental> honestly you won't ever need more than 25 hp if you actually try
[1:00:19] <+zooeymainbtw> very silly
[1:00:21] <%eanscrale> You can always respec it's not an issue
[1:00:22] <+Dimfish> theyre being big babies
[1:00:24] <epicbehemoth> @papa_bearman seriously?! how?!
[1:00:27] <CastellanVon> People need to chill. Besides, you can totally just respect
[1:00:27] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> we are going BACK to glitzvile
[1:00:27] <niozonbi> There are plenty of HP and FP increasing badges
[1:00:27] <%Chatterbox1991> CRAZY TALK
[1:00:28] <%Superbro64> one guy is FED
[1:00:30] <%SirGO0SE> i cant believe those people even played the game and think this
[1:00:32] <+AbnormalVoid> yeyeye
[1:00:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:00:32] <%FusRoDom> The overlay is jacked up
[1:00:33] <slimey0> @WoolieVersus this isn't a hard game don't stress it
[1:00:34] <Drusain> Yeah 25/25 is super normal
[1:00:34] <Daniel_Is_I> HP/FP Plus badges are a temp fix
[1:00:35] <@Menitta> Its like that one ProZD video
[1:00:35] <noe_juan_kanobe> Max BP is 99, so that's only thirty levels
[1:00:35] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s insane
[1:00:35] <vaderxyz1970> Pump BP
[1:00:39] <%DatAsuna> I can't believe woolie got a guy fired by not leveling his HP while eating raw meat
[1:00:41] <iRobschach> I jumped in at the right time, Glitzville is the peak of the whole Mario series
[1:00:41] <niozonbi> You can go all BP and still raise your other stat through badges.
[1:00:42] <coughman> doubt
[1:00:43] <Prevot> grinding isn't a thing in this game tho
[1:00:43] <bbblaketwitching> I dont know why people don't trust hp badges
[1:00:44] <%krispen_wa> GET HUGE OFFSCREEN
[1:00:47] <+masked_hero_lucky> Oh, did the footage of them getting to Glitzville get lost? The last Paper Mario VOD I saw was really short
[1:00:49] <Sp3ctre48> This game is not remotely hard enough to warrant pumping HP that much
[1:00:49] <muniea3> put it all in luck
[1:00:51] <townzzzzz> ooooooo the tournament arc
[1:00:51] <+RowenCleric> why do people love to backseat RPGS soooo much
[1:00:51] <%elbigante> NO CRUNCH
[1:00:51] <bbblaketwitching> you need at most 1 hp level
[1:00:52] <Papa_Bearman> @epicbehemoth Do the Pit of 100 Trials, gain one level, do it again, gain one level, do it again...
[1:00:53] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Hey look the traveling Sisters 3 are here now
[1:00:53] <+TuskAct4> BP can be used to increase HP and FP right?
[1:00:53] <%SomersaultJustice> doo bee do do
[1:00:54] <%SuperKirby24> BACK TO THE RUSTLEEEE
[1:00:55] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @WoolieVersus There are ways to alter your stats that you'll unlock later, so don't worry too much about it
[1:00:56] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[1:00:56] <+xeros720> you can grind if you want, but generally you really don't want to
[1:00:56] <%RyTYoung> Lucky Mario ftw
[1:00:57] <+AbnormalVoid> Level Up go BPPPPPPP
[1:01:00] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:01:01] <@Menitta> THE DO FIGHT YEAH
[1:01:01] <epicbehemoth> also there's chet rippo
[1:01:03] <trandoshanguy> Woolie, just play how you want. You should get to have your own experience.
[1:01:04] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> no crust
[1:01:04] <GHouseduivel> Scoot
[1:01:05] <+AbnormalVoid> SourPls
[1:01:09] <@akuda_bar> ok we'll never get him to fix the overlay if we say it intermittently so we all need to spam it if we care
[1:01:10] <bbblaketwitching> @tuskact4 at perfect conversion
[1:01:10] <warp_zoner> back to the Tournament
[1:01:13] <%MonsterEnvy> Some new NPCs just showed up out side
[1:01:13] <GHouseduivel> oh that's a pig nvm
[1:01:14] <iRobschach> FEEL THE RAWK BOYS
[1:01:15] <+AJiiij> woolie will figure it out.
[1:01:15] <draginmastr> last session was split into two vods
[1:01:22] <VanTheMann> Woolie's fine, game's pretty forgiving
[1:01:22] <lunacifur> The people saying u need to pump hp have never touched an A button in their life
[1:01:24] <epicbehemoth> @papa_bearman that's wild
[1:01:26] <niozonbi> Yeah there are badges that offer a level's worth of HP or FP in exchange for a level's worth of BP.
[1:01:26] <%SirGO0SE> @DatAsuna and I heard he stole the pies from the funeral
[1:01:28] <bbblaketwitching> ERE WE GO
[1:01:30] <+xeros720> 8 inches of layered 2d sprites
[1:01:30] <GHouseduivel> Look at this huge GC dong
[1:01:31] <Papa_Bearman> Oh, by the way, that Shine Sprite in front of the building? You can get that now with the tools you have.
[1:01:32] <%CursedNobleman> All hail Dark Lord Jeff Bombzos. AMZN 3000!
[1:01:33] <%Proxzo> @WoolieVersus You can explore the sewers more with each new partner/curse/upgrade.
[1:01:38] <%lotharrio> It's not blocking anything, and nothing is happening in that corner anyway. I'm okay with it.
[1:01:39] <%infinite_rotation> 8 pixels soft
[1:01:43] <TheMrRental> When I was a stupid fucking kid I used to say you needed 50 hp.
[1:01:45] <%kyh9> this used the crowd stuff to create some great atmosphere
[1:01:49] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus your overlay is fucked up a bit
[1:01:50] <%Proxzo> Love the stream. Keep up the good streamin
[1:01:50] <benbag13> talk to them
[1:01:50] <TheMrRental> but I was also a STUPID FUCKING KID
[1:01:55] <iRobschach> I'm so sad PM will never have a chapter as good as Glitzville ever again :(
[1:01:56] <Daniel_Is_I> @WoolieVersus Overlay is screwed.

[2:01:58] <pixel_river> YES
[2:01:58] <ElbyBoxus> people just like numbers
[2:01:59] <BreakersAweigh> this game's too easy for chat to backseat
[2:02:00] <Zebroneath> You're not helping anyone with this, chat.
[2:02:01] <+dukeofhammer> good
[2:02:01] <+TheRisingPride> Do it just like that

[2:02:02] <projectmanatees> time out half of chat we keep doing this till we safe
[2:02:02] <%SirGO0SE> its nothing and has nothing to do with nothing
[2:02:02] <niozonbi> Sounds good
[2:02:03] <+It_sjustjoey> EMOTE ONLY
[2:02:03] <+CptBritches> It is nothing to do with gameplay at all

[2:02:16] <%HitchhikingThrough> yeah fair.
[2:02:17] <missingangle> Woolie just don't look at chat. You'd save some stress from that, because we suck ass

[2:02:28] <%SirGO0SE> emote only is good idea
[2:02:29] <Thunderhog> The only thing on fire is chat
[2:02:30] <%zamzoph> chat knows that Woolie doesn't know and just wants to spoil mechanics
[2:02:32] <%ChoculaUltra> Someone shoot that guy
[2:02:33] <epicbehemoth> if you want points for bonus items you should take advantage of these specials. it's gonna help for item grinding and nets you decent items for this chapter

[2:28:25] <%dinnydanny777> I now feel very very sick
[2:28:25] <HereComestheChief> It was the impact in hitting the ropes that killed him
[2:28:26] <Run44forrest> monkaS

[2:28:28] <%bread_assassin> Ohhhhh
[2:28:29] <bbblaketwitching> My oh my

[2:28:30] <Run44forrest> monkaS wtf
[2:28:30] <%SuperKirby24> there's video of that
[2:28:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Internal decapitation is horrible
[2:28:32] <%wibbwobbler> 619 baby
[2:28:32] <NiktenKing> cervical decapitation
[2:28:33] <ZenobyGoat> yeah he looked pretty dead
[2:28:33] <+JingKaisean> an irish whip killed a guy?
[2:28:34] <+Vardek13> Yeah nobody noticed when he fell, it was on the guy falling + neck issued
[2:28:34] <Hillthugsta> Figure Four for life.
[2:28:35] <%Taglog7> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:28:37] <SummonerMagno> the ropes are just steel wires
[2:28:39] <SoratheWonderful> \:-?\(
[2:28:41] <nyacoo> Wrestling is real
[2:28:44] <%Proxzo> ooof
[2:28:44] <technical_tf> Guys maybe wrestling is bad actually
[2:28:47] <+CrazyRainbows> internal decapitation is the most horrifying combination of words evrr
[2:28:47] <%StarMechV> i wanna barf now
[2:28:49] <marshalmorphino2> A similar thing happened to Scott Steiner in Puerto Rico
[2:28:50] <ZenobyGoat> didn't he kick the back of his head while he was on the rope?
[2:28:51] <+Dimfish> im sure ray mysterio feels awful
[2:28:53] <+Ultimate_Edge> He ate a steel rope right to neck
[2:28:54] <%Proxzo> man that's horrible
[2:28:54] <Solidnick18> wrestling is a blend
[2:28:57] <SpookyCarnage> He broke his neck, had a stroke, and the stroke caused a heart attack
[2:28:59] <marshalmorphino2> He nearly died but surgeons saved him
[2:29:00] <ZenobyGoat> so now the 619 kicks them in the face instead?
[2:29:02] <%Chatterbox1991> guy had Spinal Stignosis
[2:29:03] <huskarl_zap> ECW ECW ECW
[2:29:03] <bbblaketwitching> Well, that's a real ass tragedy
[2:29:03] <Davybot> is there video of it????
[2:29:08] <+Vardek13> yes
[2:29:11] <+geosspone> how much time has it been since they picked up the egg?
[2:29:13] <%debrv> Internal Decapitation..... Jeez...
[2:29:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> He died from a 'cervical stroke'. What the actual fuck.
[2:29:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> At 'best?'
[2:29:18] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus Perro Aguayo died because of the ropes and people were calling out Rey Mysterio.. Like geezus people
[2:29:27] <Run44forrest> wait so did he die or not?
[2:29:28] <Manwad> I just saw the vid and oh man
[2:29:29] <huskarl_zap> 420 ROB VAN DAM
[2:29:30] <+It_sjustjoey> Did they tinker with the 'gamecube', stream looks crispy
[2:29:31] <%lotharrio> Just tell people you're a master of pressure points, and that you can gently touch people until they pass out.
[2:29:34] <coughman> at best 40 years, at worst one day
[2:29:34] <ZenobyGoat> Rey did throw him tho right
[2:29:35] <+Grayhammatter> EZ, no specials
[2:29:37] <+ladomania> Big E stopped doing a spear because he almost died
[2:29:37] <marshalmorphino2> It was Pedro Aguayo Jr.
[2:29:42] <al0nem0nster> can't wait for only parries.
[2:29:42] <%SvenHolgersson> Just saw the footage
[2:29:43] <%dinnydanny777> In the UK we had a celebrity ski competition and someone broke their neck and damaged their spine live on TV, she was actually an Olympian as well
[2:29:45] <%SvenHolgersson> Yowch
[2:29:46] <%ozmon> Earth Tremor's probably not the greatest stunt to uphold, huh
[2:29:48] <ZenobyGoat> I don't blame Rey tbh, it was a freak accident
[2:29:49] <%cdrom321> Okay. My special move is called "I Have a Gun".
[2:29:50] <%StarMechV> "No special moves...last one we got had his head internally decapitated!"
[2:29:57] <%dinnydanny777> She could have died
[2:29:59] <%SvenHolgersson> That was a freak accident for sure
[2:30:01] <marshalmorphino2> I’ve seen live matches with Big E doing the spear through the ropes and it’s horrifying
[2:30:02] <%doombawkzvs> RIP Perro Aguayo Jr
[2:30:02] <%MayorRev> oh god there's FUCKING FOOTAGE NOPE

[2:46:18] <+geosspone> no changing partners
[2:46:20] <Kirlrik> children's game
[2:46:20] <%Ancopro> yes
[2:46:21] <TheHotStuven> Correct
[2:46:22] <+marumariball> yes
[2:46:24] <%cdrom321> Correct. Defense applies to each hit.
[2:46:25] <Daniel_Is_I> Yes
[2:46:28] <+TheRisingPride> Basic math!
[2:46:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sometimes big number is more important than do combo
[2:46:30] <+Grayhammatter> correct
[2:46:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> What's (1-1) x 5?
[2:46:32] <%krispen_wa> WOOLIE HAS FIGURED MATH OUT
[2:46:33] <+GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> right
[2:46:34] <%ozmon> I love this game
[2:46:39] <+IceyCone> its cause when they're flipped they're defense becomes 0
[2:46:43] <frigglefroogle> let him experiment, this is his first playthough y'sll
[2:46:44] <maple26> e e g
[2:46:47] <Daniel_Is_I> I think if the first hit of Power Bounce breaks through, all hits will do minimum 1, but that's the only exception
[2:46:49] <+baggy3058> almost time

You add the Great Gonzales to the mix and your odds of winning Drastically go down. You got a 8 and 1/3% chance of winning, and if you add his 66% chance to win, he's got a 141% chance to win at Glitzpit. The numbers don't lie and they spell disaster for you!

[4:10:16] <GarbageNirvana> Mission Hill whips ass
[4:10:16] <%doombawkzvs> Mission Hill so good
[4:10:17] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> They might change Ghandi to Gary Coleman.
[4:10:19] <%jiggy_snipe> or young adults
[4:10:19] <%chiluzza> mission hill was great
[4:10:20] <+StrawberryPantsu> Adult Animation is back due to the rona
[4:10:26] <ShoggothLord> Mission Hill
[4:10:26] <astrofalcon1> mission hill was actual people in the city
[4:10:30] <ShinobiPhoenix> there's a Daria spin-off coming too
[4:10:32] <Bguy32> thanks for the great Stream Woolie
[4:10:36] <%lotharrio> Simpsons for 20-somethings.

[4:10:38] <%mar_krow> 6teen
[4:10:38] <%kyh9> Very 90s
[4:10:40] <zekana> I know its not mtv but where is my new megas xlr?
[4:10:44] <Bennett_Fracture> the only drama free channel on the net right now...
[4:10:47] <%kyh9> Mission Hill is peak-90s
[4:10:49] <%jiggy_snipe> late 90s early 00s
[4:10:54] <%kyh9> Clone High is more early 2000s
[4:10:56] <OldManDeckardCain> "young adults" speaking of mr wizard....
[4:10:57] <astrofalcon1> LUL
[4:10:58] <%jiggy_snipe> why LUL
[4:10:59] <Sol_Install> They kinda have too
[4:11:04] <%eanscrale> whut
[4:11:11] <%dinnydanny777> Hey you can animate him
[4:11:13] <Bennett_Fracture> thank you for being work safe you guys...
[4:11:14] <+NickHatesSnow> Ghandi is the reason it got cancelled
[4:11:17] <Sol_Install> that was a big issue back then
[4:11:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Way way back in the 1980s~
[4:11:18] <+thunka10> Yeah they're clones
[4:11:19] <%dinnydanny777> You can literally animate him
[4:11:30] <%lotharrio> One of the reasons they shut it down was because the Indians were very upset that Ghandi was used as a character.
[4:11:33] <%TubeMan642> yeah
[4:11:34] <%lotharrio> There was a hunger strike.
[4:11:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You didn't know?
[4:11:35] <%SvenHolgersson> Did you not hear about the controversy?
[4:11:37] <%jiggy_snipe> oh really
[4:11:38] <+ConLin_Arts_> Oh yeah got the Imaishi artbook today and it had some art from the Namco X Capcom opening Woolie uses at the end
[4:11:38] <+NickHatesSnow> yeah
[4:11:40] <%wrightlight94> Yep
[4:11:43] <+thunka10> Yeah I saw that too
[4:11:45] <%DatAsuna> Ghandi big racist
[4:11:57] <%dinnydanny777> Ghandi the sleeps with kids man
[4:12:00] <%kyh9> Itwas mostly ratings
[4:12:01] <Bennett_Fracture> you too chat...
[4:12:04] <%SvenHolgersson> People went on food strikes over Ghandi being ADHD
[4:12:06] <%jiggy_snipe> yea ratings
[4:12:06] <%kyh9> They got cancelled over ratings
[4:12:09] <GarbageNirvana> The point is network execs have no idea what's good
[4:12:13] <+twohitgood> aeon flux was great. too bad the movie sucked. the show was amazing
[4:12:19] <%gatorafan> All I know about Ghandi is that he really liked nukes Kappa
[4:12:21] <Leafboi125> Yeah real Ghandi oof
[4:12:21] <+thunka10> "They couldn't find an episode that showed ghandi in a respectful light"
[4:12:21] <%DatAsuna> Ghandi wants to make it VERY clear that he thinks racism is only for the nwords
[4:12:23] <+DrFacilier> Hell yeah Lord Miller
[4:12:25] <%jiggy_snipe> wrong time or poor marketing, they all have cult followings
[4:12:25] <+d_blythie> Daria was a beavis and Butthead spin-off to begin with
[4:12:25] <%Superbro64> so is mtv going to fun ANOTHER single season then? Kappa
[4:12:30] <SpeedyCloud17> LUL
[4:12:34] <%kyh9> you can watch all of Clone High on youtube RIGHT NOW
[4:12:43] <%mar_krow> All of these were great
[4:12:51] <marshalmorphino2> They did the LEGO movie
[4:12:54] <%p4ntless> I'm so fucking excited for the mission hill spinoff
[4:12:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Best news all month
[4:13:05] <astrofalcon1> not king of the hill
[4:13:06] <%dinnydanny777> To be fair Ghandi did grow up under an Imperialist rule so his views on race may have been very backwards
[4:13:06] <%jiggy_snipe> KoTH
[4:13:07] <Potatoidea> Yep
[4:13:09] <%SvenHolgersson> Yea dude
[4:13:09] <Bennett_Fracture> French version on teletoon...
[4:13:13] <%SvenHolgersson> Daria was in their class
[4:13:17] <Bennett_Fracture> imagine that...
[4:13:18] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Speaking of Beavis and Butthead...
[4:13:18] <%dinnydanny777> Still bad though
[4:13:25] <%lotharrio> King of the Hill is a pseudo-spin off.
[4:13:26] <Mahbonk> Hemri et sa gang LUL
[4:13:28] <astrofalcon1> no just his voice
[4:13:30] <%SvenHolgersson> Proto Hank was that one dude
[4:13:32] <+AbnormalVoid> The Judge-verse
[4:13:35] <KumaTorey> the Judgeverse
[4:13:42] <+Dova573> Wait HANK HILL was from bevis?
[4:13:42] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Judge confirmed he’s coming back for more episodes
[4:13:46] <RaidenisDead> diarrhea cha cha cha
[4:13:49] <+mckraven> King of the Hill is a texas icon
[4:13:59] <Potatoidea> @Dova573 They had a neighbor that was basically a prototype for Hank
[4:14:04] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Mike Judge made a hippy show that no one remembers.
[4:14:08] <%sexdrugsvideogames> damn
[4:14:11] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Clone High also had a bunch of music
[4:14:14] <PhantomMaskJr> @woolieversus Beavis and Butthead is coming back on Comedy Central
[4:14:14] <%p4ntless> French-Canadian boomhauer is funny as hell
[4:14:14] <%RadicalWeegee> awwwww dang
[4:14:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> same with Clone High
[4:14:16] <astrofalcon1> @SmokerWest for good reason
[4:14:18] <%jiggy_snipe> damn that sucks
[4:14:23] <astrofalcon1> it was very mediocre
[4:14:23] <%SirGO0SE> i wonder if theres a cut of it with the music "somewhere"
[4:14:31] <%jiggy_snipe> yea that's true
[4:14:31] <%dinnydanny777> I know the Netflix version of Scrubs changed every single song
[4:14:34] <+thunka10> they had to use stock music 😭
[4:14:42] <%sexdrugsvideogames> sux big time
[4:14:45] <Bennett_Fracture> sons of butcher was lit as hell...
[4:14:48] <+ConLin_Arts_> Clone High also had MTVs music library
[4:14:50] <PhantomMaskJr> They replaced it with generic music
[4:14:52] <%chosenjuan42> If Philli has a Rocky statue then Texas needs a Hank Hill one
[4:14:52] <%dinnydanny777> Because they had lost the copyright
[4:15:15] <+thunka10> nice
[4:15:15] <%DatAsuna> the other colours suck
[4:15:17] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie Big Green fan
[4:15:19] <%SvenHolgersson> I got red I think
[4:15:23] <%DatAsuna> they have different hair too
[4:15:26] <%krispen_wa> ONE CHAT
[4:15:27] <%prime_name> Oh, I thought chat was actually blowing up about the point system
[4:15:28] <Prevot> nah black yoshi is the best one
[4:15:35] <%Superbro64> I doubt 1000 guy's ability to communicate that well
[4:15:36] <SoratheWonderful> I always got orange
[4:15:36] <Leafboi125> GREEN is my favorite@color
[4:15:36] <Potatoidea> 15 minutes until Pickle Stone
[4:15:36] <Shwepie> As soon as Woolie got the egg everyone started yelling about it.
[4:15:37] <%The_Timo> @WoolieVersus I sent you the thing on facebook lol. People get excited man, it happens
[4:15:38] <fritz_dacat> I Heard Jodie from daria getting a spin off series
[4:15:38] <@akuda_bar> they weren't yelling to you though, they're talking to each other @WoolieVersus
[4:15:41] <%DatAsuna> So woolie got the best outcome
[4:15:42] <%Druuplays_> Pink is where it’s at
[4:15:43] <lotharrio> Oh black yoshi looks cool.
[4:15:44] <%SvenHolgersson> red yellow black
[4:15:46] <%dinnydanny777> Is he stronger depending on colour
[4:15:49] <%SvenHolgersson> oh and pink
[4:15:49] <Ner234> Chat needs to learn when something doesn't matter...
[4:15:50] <+geosspone> red, blue, yellow, pink, black, white, green
[4:15:51] <+twohitgood> black Yoshi is cool.
[4:15:51] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Red yes, Yellow no.
[4:15:52] <%The_Timo> or white or pink or black or blue
[4:15:54] <%prime_name> Red, Black, White, Blue, Pink, Orange
[4:15:55] <%wrightlight94> Yeah I got the blue yoshi
[4:15:57] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus He can also be a posh yoshi .etc with different hairstyles
[4:16:01] <%lotharrio> I see a good looking orange, too.
[4:16:03] <@Menitta> Orange is the best color
[4:16:04] <WarKamex> colors are green, red, blue, orange, pink, black, white
[4:16:05] <astrofalcon1> alright but cyan yoshi
[4:16:05] <%jiggy_snipe> WHAT
[4:16:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie a lot of chat was yelling at each other too.
[4:16:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I got green too I didn't even know that was a thing
[4:16:15] <Rhinoprotoss> Woolie picked that default colour
[4:16:19] <KumaTorey> basic taste woolie
[4:16:23] <%SvenHolgersson> The best part is the different hairstyles
[4:16:23] <Leafboi125> LETS GO
[4:16:25] <%DatAsuna> White yoshi has the worst hair
[4:16:29] <Mahbonk> only babies used Blue Yoshi in SMW anyway
[4:16:31] <+NishtvNT> tax free yoshi LUL
[4:16:39] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[4:16:43] <%DatAsuna> We need to white genocide white yoshi
[4:16:46] <+bokutachi_san> LP is RUINED unless yoshi is the color I want
[4:16:49] <marshalmorphino2> Remember it takes all colors to make a rainbow
[4:16:49] <+thunka10> @mahbonk how DARE you :(
[4:16:52] <@akuda_bar> i think they were mostly guessing which color you were gonna get lol
[4:16:52] <%chosenjuan42> purple and green?
[4:16:55] <marshalmorphino2> Except black
[4:16:58] <Mahbonk> @Lazyjoules i am baby
[4:17:01] <marshalmorphino2> There’s no black in a rainbow
[4:17:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:17:09] <%mar_krow> Lol
[4:17:13] <+thunka10> @mahbonk I was too! :(
[4:17:21] <%krispen_wa> Hey man, he just wants to surf and spend time with his wife. I respect it
[4:17:33] <fritz_dacat> He did injure alot of ppl in NXT though
[4:17:41] <+twohitgood> I was let down that they just made him into an evil foreigner.
[4:17:42] <%dinnydanny777> Hey listen, he'll retire with his spine and brain intact
[4:17:48] <%dinnydanny777> Sounds good
[4:17:49] <+Dova573> Asuka is current the champ
[4:17:51] <%krispen_wa> Asuka beat Goldberg's record
[4:17:59] <+twohitgood> the whole "no speak English" gimmick was cringe.
[4:18:00] <UnlimitedBick> QUEEN ASUKA REIGNS
[4:18:04] <%krispen_wa> and she's accomplished pretty much everything a woman can do in the WWE
[4:18:05] <marshalmorphino2> She has a huge undefeated streak
[4:18:14] <%DatAsuna> but also it's one chatterbox
[4:18:17] <fritz_dacat> But he coudnt handle AJ Styles
[4:18:24] <+Dova573> Asuka is champion again
[4:18:27] <%Chatterbox1991> like i do respect him wanting to chill but it was disappointing for how hyped up he was
[4:18:33] <UnlimitedBick> waiting for asuka to start beating men
[4:18:34] <ImmaCanuck> Remember when Shinsuke and Asuka both won the Royal Rumbles and then lost at Wrestlemania?
[4:18:58] <fritz_dacat> But that Nakamura intro was pure hype
[4:18:59] <UnlimitedBick> @ImmaCanuck remember kofimania
[4:19:23] <%Chatterbox1991> @DatAsuna this a not uncommon sentiment; Nakamura's run was not a lot of fun
[4:19:23] <UnlimitedBick> ooh member rusev
[4:19:25] <%prime_name> Don't think so. They won the Royal Rumble at the same time
[4:19:29] <%jiggy_snipe> and then Kofi came to Fox
[4:19:30] <+Dova573> And Asuka is currently womens champ
[4:19:33] <marshalmorphino2> They were, but then they both lost
[4:19:34] <%sexdrugsvideogames> bruce lee quote
[4:19:36] <ImmaCanuck> Rusev Day!
