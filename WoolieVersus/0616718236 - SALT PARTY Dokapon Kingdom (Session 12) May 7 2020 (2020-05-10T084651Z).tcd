[0:07:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> BUT IT'S GOTTA MATCH
[0:07:45] <andrei11dr> I had some once
[0:07:47] <Victory_Boss> Woolie speaks as the paragon of truth
[0:07:49] <Camail> no but its about having the proper knee consistency

[0:08:03] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @imbuildinggundams just donate d mention it being for the bloodpool
[0:08:09] <+TenguGemini> @WoolieVersus is a hinny an acceptable alternative to the mule?
[0:08:11] <Camail> if you have the premium face but your normal knees it breaks the illusion
[0:08:14] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus they want to put blackface on their knees
[0:08:15] <thesickestzak> Is his friend's last name Trudeau?

[0:08:34] <Camail> tearknack huh what? blackface? nah we're just talking about the experience
[0:08:35] <Klefth> I think he means, perhaps, styling the skin exposed by the holes in... a certain fashion

[0:12:16] <%Nekros4442> Kaiji has more power up moments than Dragonball >_>. Didnt they spend like 8 episodes on 1 game of Pachinko?
[0:12:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> REGGIE why.
[0:12:17] <%C4m3r0n0409> Kakegurui Live action lol
[0:12:17] <%Grayhammatter> WHY?
[0:12:18] <%tearfuldevil> kakegurui is EH
[0:12:19] <Zayasu> madhouse fucked up overlord s3 FeelsBadMan
[0:12:26] <%phatmac16> It’s real bad
[0:12:31] <Agami23> the dude who did kaiji did Akagi as well
[0:12:35] <Brutalx21> @Zayasu yes
[0:12:36] <%phatmac16> Not really
[0:12:36] <KillMyPast> Kaiji is the best
[0:12:37] <+Gespens> WHAT GIRLS?
[0:12:39] <+Invlux> I like Kakegurui PepeSad
[0:12:39] <resloxxx> tomatoBWL

[0:12:49] <+Gespens> unless you mean Kakegurui
[0:12:49] <arkv01> nothing wrong with kakegurui, it satisfies the horny
[0:12:54] <SoySocks> kakegurui OP and ED are great
[0:12:56] <eldragon_1> Kakegurui is not as good as Kaiji
[0:12:57] <%phatmac16> Kaiji is sick
[0:12:59] <%Nekros4442> I would striaght off stop Kaiji once you hit the Pachinko arc >_>

[0:13:08] <%nothuzad> snek
[0:13:12] <Iwashi94> Kakegurui feels like it has no stakes
[0:13:13] <%Zerotoad5> Kekegurui is good but not Kaiji good
[0:13:14] <arkv01> kakegurui and kaiji only overlap in the gambling genre but are very different shows
[0:13:15] <%Lion_kun> Pachinko arc is the best!

[0:24:17] <Camail> everyone's one person
[0:24:18] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YES
[0:24:19] <%tearfuldevil> YES
[0:24:19] <+IamGrapes> i remember that meme
[0:24:19] <%nothuzad> spears are like the dominant thing
[0:24:21] <+DesertPenguin> yup
[0:24:21] <Shishi1205> Yes
[0:24:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> YES
[0:24:22] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ABSOLUTELY
[0:24:23] <%yeetdabsenpai69> YES
[0:24:23] <stormhawk9891> YES
[0:24:23] <+eanscrale> Yeah
[0:24:24] <resloxxx> YES
[0:24:26] <%Nekros4442> Spears are much easier to teach and cost less to make
[0:24:26] <%GenesisKnight> Yes
[0:24:27] <Shishi1205> Spears are way better
[0:24:27] <Tuna_Can_0> yes
[0:24:27] <%paladinstarbuster> ABSOLUTELY
[0:24:27] <%kekkerscrew> YES
[0:24:27] <+DesertPenguin> and shields
[0:24:28] <Isord> YES
[0:24:28] <Picosunloaded> yes
[0:24:29] <%Daba_mk2> spears are op
[0:24:29] <andrei11dr> Yes
[0:24:31] <%gunsrlove> Spears are the most used weapons in history
[0:24:31] <alexandrecau> clubs are the main
[0:24:32] <%countgaculatv> Swords are cooler
[0:24:32] <+TossuDa> Yes
[0:24:32] <%phatmac16> Yes
[0:24:33] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SWORDS SUCK
[0:24:34] <%C4m3r0n0409> Spears are way better than spears
[0:24:34] <juicysal> swords were a status symbol
[0:24:34] <%DatAsuna> Even samurai used spears
[0:24:35] <Tuna_Can_0> spears are way op
[0:24:35] <%TimetodiveLTX> Spears are OP, it's dumb
[0:24:36] <stormhawk9891> You didn't know?
[0:24:36] <pixel_river> ?????
[0:24:37] <%kekkerscrew> Knights used Spears
[0:24:38] <%jiggy_snipe> dont vanish
[0:24:38] <%TimetodiveLTX> nerf spears
[0:24:41] <ianrspc> Anime watcher here, wtf is going on I'm so lost holy shit. how did Reggie get back in first I'm still on the arc where they are all mages HOLY SHIT
[0:24:46] <+xerotwo> SPEARS ARE LAME LUL
[0:24:49] <%phatmac16> Swords are side arms
[0:24:49] <%Nekros4442> BITCH YOU HIT FIRST THATS WHY YOU USE A SPEAR
[0:24:54] <%nothuzad> Spears are op as fuck - but swords are used on regalias and shit
[0:24:54] <%Daba_mk2> spears are cool
[0:24:55] <coldfire0007> Swords were just a personal defence weapon
[0:24:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Wars are fought with spears.
[0:24:56] <%countgaculatv> Swords are the main character weapon
[0:24:57] <%DatAsuna> Spears and bows
[0:24:57] <BlkFlameKami> DRAGOON BOIS RISE UP
[0:24:58] <Shishi1205> Great the Spellsword using vanish
[0:24:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Spear has so much more uses
[0:25:01] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @ianrspc REGGIE BIG BRAINED LAST SESSION
[0:25:03] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus hit first
[0:25:04] <%gatorafan> Partizan gang o/
[0:25:06] <+MrAtheGreat> Spears are for everyone, but Swords grew in popularity because they survived in the modern world.
[0:25:07] <+IamGrapes> arent spears generally easier to make as well?
[0:25:07] <Tuna_Can_0> why use a small metal stick vs long ass pole with a pointy end
[0:25:09] <%kekkerscrew> Reggie Nooo
[0:25:11] <+eanscrale> Historically zoning was the meta yes.
[0:25:17] <coldfire0007> Youre right
[0:25:19] <%phatmac16> You’re right
[0:25:21] <+eanscrale> It's the meta now in fact
[0:25:21] <%jiggy_snipe> @Shishi1205 he didn't even attempt to squall minh
[0:25:25] <%DatAsuna> Well swords were more apt to become heirlooms
[0:25:26] <%xcompleasedad> Starting out STRONG with the Reggie rolls. NotLikeThis
[0:25:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @ianrspc Reggie killed Woolie with a sneak hit and took his highest town
[0:25:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:25:28] <%paladinstarbuster> LANCER FTW
[0:25:28] <Shishi1205> ye
[0:25:30] <andrei11dr> But guns might beat every weapon eventually
[0:25:31] <%nothuzad> IamGrapes they are too yes
[0:25:31] <Brandon__Brando> its like a war being fought with pistols
[0:25:34] <%Irridium> literally zoning IRL
[0:25:35] <+Invlux> fo sho
[0:25:36] <nepwar> ohno
[0:25:38] <resloxxx> Polearms are meta
[0:25:38] <%tearfuldevil> fucking fauchards
[0:25:39] <pixel_river> I like Halberds if the count
[0:25:41] <%emperordread> Less material needed to make spear. Just wood for the shaft and metal tip. Sword needs a lot more
[0:25:41] <%SomersaultJustice> and that's why minh plays dragoon
[0:25:44] <+TenguGemini> spears are for range, shield walls, and are generally much cheaper and easier to produce
[0:25:46] <nepwar> oh no oh boy
[0:25:51] <+MrAtheGreat> Calvary sabers for eg was kept for commanders.
[0:25:52] <%DatAsuna> part of the advantage of swords is you smelt the whole thing, not just stick it on the end of some wood
[0:25:56] <%phatmac16> Shields are the best weapon
[0:25:57] <%nothuzad> emperordread well primitive spears are wood and cut stone
[0:26:04] <%Grayhammatter> reggie, you are a spellsword
[0:26:04] <%DatAsuna> so it had more aesthetic value
[0:26:04] <+TenguGemini> swords were sidearms, for duels, and for prestige
[0:26:06] <andrei11dr> Welp he's actually fucked now
[0:26:06] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie you're a spell sword
[0:26:12] <%DatAsuna> as like a display/prestige piece
[0:26:14] <Agami23> fuck sabers.
[0:26:18] <%jiggy_snipe> you have 50/50 shot of magic bouncing back
[0:26:22] <Shishi1205> Bakout
[0:26:23] <Mikob09> Swords are prevalent in pop culture because they were used by nobility more often than not
[0:26:24] <+Mendin> Reggie you're a wizard
[0:26:24] <Tuna_Can_0> didn't maces become a new meta once armor was more abbundant?
[0:26:27] <%DatAsuna> Spears were more useful but you could get way more ornamental with swords
[0:26:28] <%kekkerscrew> Reggie you are the hero, stop hiding
[0:26:28] <+nekodelic> @emperordread that's why swords were also used to symbolize social status
[0:26:30] <Shishi1205> ???
[0:26:31] <+NWannabe> moreannoyed by the need to defend it
[0:26:35] <nepwar> hm
[0:26:36] <+NWannabe> Just do you
[0:26:37] <%irfan_> wait woolie didnt go to
[0:26:41] <+slamzalid> :D
[0:26:45] <Shishi1205> Woolie why
[0:26:49] <nepwar> did woolie make the biggest mistake
[0:26:51] <andrei11dr> Reggie is PJSalt already
[0:26:55] <Camail> did he go to the wrong temple
[0:26:55] <+elbigante> Reggie singlehandedly progressing the game despite it all
[0:26:57] <+eanscrale> time them out!
[0:26:58] <%nothuzad> Robot_Nixon_ maces, cudgles and hamemrs have their function but polearms feature BOTH - a sharp and a blunt side
[0:27:05] <Shishi1205> Is woolie trying to go underground first?
[0:27:08] <TheOnlyGorgon> doesn't spell sword reflect any field magic?
[0:27:12] <+slamzalid> Good Afternoon My Dudes!! how are you doing today? too? HeyGuys <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[0:27:15] <unlimitedgachaworks> Well you guys added money to the mix. Of course the "fuck each other" antics become more prominent
[0:27:16] <Shishi1205> 50% chance
[0:27:21] <%nothuzad> theonlygorgon 50%
[0:27:22] <%Grayhammatter> wow
[0:27:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie quoting that Person 5 "Take your Time". I'm starting to hear "Rainy Day at the Cafe" play in my head.
[0:27:26] <thesickestzak> The issue isnt Minh, the issue is how far the other two let Minh get
[0:27:27] <+MrAtheGreat> They really need to kill minh.
[0:27:31] <%Grayhammatter> OH GOD
[0:27:31] <%fuji_92> damn early PJSalt I see LUL
[0:27:39] <Decimated_body> Doged that shit
[0:27:41] <TheOnlyGorgon> ok
[0:27:42] <unlimitedgachaworks> woolieCHAN
[0:27:43] <Shishi1205> Yeah vanished spellsword
[0:27:43] <%big_oki> stand ability
[0:27:49] <andrei11dr> Reggie is all the way back at Dokapon castle, that's a long way from where he needs to be
[0:27:50] <%gatorafan> amazing rolls
[0:27:58] <%paladinstarbuster> NOT JUST IMMUNITY REFLECT
[0:28:07] <%Kriss1827> @fujiwara_92 heyyo kriss1Hrt hope you're well
[0:28:10] <Camail> we'll find out
[0:28:15] <+Gespens> It's as if you casted it at yourself, I think?
[0:28:16] <+nekodelic> if the spellsword dodges, does he reflect?
[0:28:16] <%Grayhammatter> we'll find out
[0:28:21] <%C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[0:28:26] <%kekkerscrew> It's reflect
[0:28:29] <glass_marcus> It's ALWAYS more of a risk for the person casting it because they will be wasting a resource
[0:28:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> The Anti-Minh tech
[0:28:34] <Maleicus> I think its 100
[0:28:37] <alexandrecau> @andrei11dr no shit minh tk'ed him across the map
[0:28:37] <$JobbedBone> if its allowed in the game, you have to use it or you aren't really competing. thats why steroids aren't allowed because it forces people to put their health at risk to be competitive
[0:28:41] <%Solidnick18> why not
[0:28:42] <Tuna_Can_0> @nothuzad I see what you mean, but unless the whole thing was metal how do it smash?
[0:28:42] <%irfan_> woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT
[0:28:44] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:28:45] <%Grayhammatter> oh snap, is woolie doing it?
[0:28:45] <%jiggy_snipe> he needs buy items 1st
[0:28:47] <Shishi1205> You had to try tho
[0:28:47] <$Noponiz> actually do the objective? i dunno
[0:28:48] <%fuji_92> @kriss1827 yo KonCha
[0:28:55] <andrei11dr> I hope Minh remembers to keep pumping speed
[0:28:58] <popcultureaficionado> Minh will dodge everything
[0:29:01] <%C4m3r0n0409> item stoooore
[0:29:04] <Maleicus> At least i never saw it dodged
[0:29:06] <+MrAtheGreat> Oooo he also gotta class change in a bit
[0:29:13] <%C4m3r0n0409> VANISH
[0:29:14] <%C4m3r0n0409> YES
[0:29:20] <Shishi1205> get 3
[0:29:22] <Klefth> Well, you'll get teleported away no matter what, because no one's allowed to play the game
[0:29:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> HAHAHA
[0:29:27] <%nothuzad> Robot_Nixon_ you can grab the higher parts of the polearm to make it shorter trange but the thing si you dont need much momentum for it to go "big hurt"
[0:29:39] <andrei11dr> Lockdown him !
[0:29:43] <%Grayhammatter> get that spellsword woolie
[0:29:44] <%fuji_92> VANISH GANG
[0:29:50] <Klefth> FUCKING. LOCKDOWN.
[0:29:55] <+xerotwo> This is better than the XBOX presentation today LUL
[0:30:01] <nepwar> lockdown would be great if it hit
[0:30:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @nothuzad And even if the pointy part breaks off, you STILL have a giant stick to push/beat people with.
[0:30:08] <nepwar> but minh has all the speed
[0:30:09] <bitterssweets> shoulda just stayed unda da sea and became robo knight
[0:30:10] <alexandrecau> lockdown won't hit
[0:30:13] <%jiggy_snipe> expensive
[0:30:15] <%nothuzad> CommanderSqueaks p much
[0:30:23] <%djazo> kill reggie for the town
[0:30:26] <Tuna_Can_0> @nothuzad I was thinking more of smashing armor in, but there were probably enough weak points between seams, or spears could just pierce through
[0:30:31] <Shishi1205> Watch mminh try to make money and die to a random monster
[0:30:34] <%jiggy_snipe> i hope magic rocks him
[0:30:43] <%C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[0:30:49] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:30:53] <%C4m3r0n0409> BITCH ASS MINH
[0:30:59] <%Grayhammatter> BITCH ASS MINH
[0:31:01] <%Solidnick18> the coward heel
[0:31:07] <%nothuzad> Robot_Nixon_ the point of hamemrs isnt per se to "break" armor its to cuz internal damage from jsut the pressure
[0:31:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @robot_nixon_ Common plate armor is much better at handling slashes compared to punctures and blunt damage.
[0:31:10] <andrei11dr> Watch Minh lose all of his money to a monster
[0:31:21] <Shishi1205> That tower is going to rip his ass
[0:31:24] <%nothuzad> Robot_Nixon_ *cause
[0:31:27] <Camail> did he get into the tower in one shot..
[0:31:29] <Shishi1205> If any magic monsters are there
[0:31:31] <%fuji_92> Minh is made for desrruption
[0:31:32] <%nothuzad> physical trauma is evil
[0:31:34] <%yeetdabsenpai69> everyone press F for minh
[0:31:35] <%Grayhammatter> woof, these rolls
[0:31:38] <MahoganyWoods> Is the tower tough or is minh about to win?
[0:31:40] <%emperordread> Gambatte #TeamReggie
[0:31:43] <%yeetdabsenpai69> minh's no magic gonna be his death
[0:31:43] <%gatorafan> Does Reggie have blistered feet?
[0:31:44] <Shishi1205> No need to vanish woolie
[0:31:44] <%yeetdabsenpai69> F
[0:31:46] <%jiggy_snipe> the tower is strong
[0:31:50] <Shishi1205> Just go for it
[0:31:52] <%Grayhammatter> no need to vanish
[0:31:54] <%Quigsies> Hey guys, just got here, who's leading?
[0:31:54] <atgithursdays> hoes mad
[0:31:55] <%djazo> FIGHT
[0:31:55] <Tuna_Can_0> @nothuzad ah I see distStudy
[0:31:57] <+MrAtheGreat> Don’t vanish! Grind!
[0:31:58] <%jiggy_snipe> i don't think anyone but Woolie can handle it right now
[0:32:02] <%C4m3r0n0409> MINH IS NOT OFF THE MAP
[0:32:03] <Camail> MahoganyWoods reggie could barely handle that area and minh is weaker than reggie
[0:32:08] <%nintega010> why is woolie there why didn't he go to the area
[0:32:13] <MahoganyWoods> oh dang. now im excited.
[0:32:14] <%Grayhammatter> he went into the tower @C4m3r0n0409
[0:32:14] <+MrAtheGreat> Get. That. Class. Mastery!
[0:32:16] <andrei11dr> Minh has just brought some really good magic defense in the cave, so i think his fine
[0:32:17] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @jiggy_snipe and even woolie would be in danger
[0:32:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @nintega010 Had to stock up on Vanish
[0:32:23] <%C4m3r0n0409> OH NVM THEN

[0:34:33] <Lichzim> GL woollie
[0:34:35] <+MrAtheGreat> Tower of Rabble has the best stuff in the game.
[0:34:37] <WizardofWazz> mihn going to ssteal all the towns
[0:34:37] <Lichzim> your gonna neeed ut
[0:34:38] <%Grayhammatter> it's a wrap

[0:34:41] <+Invlux> LUL
[0:34:43] <+MrAtheGreat> Ultimate gear!
[0:34:45] <Camail> so this is why alchemist is broken
[0:34:48] <%yeetdabsenpai69> he'll die to monsters
[0:34:53] <Camail> they just gotta 2v1
[0:34:59] <Camail> they HAVE to 2v1 him
[0:35:02] <%kekkerscrew> Endgame shops boys
[0:35:03] <morningmoondude> He'll print money
[0:35:06] <bitterssweets> money chests tho
[0:35:13] <andrei11dr> Minh has can duplicate Death Calls btw
[0:35:24] <Brandon__Brando> every one needs to be a alchemist
[0:35:28] <thesickestzak> Minh will win! Minh will win! nliLUL
[0:35:31] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie needs to git gud
[0:35:33] <%irfan_> what does white arrow do again?
[0:35:35] <%Grayhammatter> every one needs to kill minh
[0:35:37] <+Gespens> Nah, they can easily 1v1 him. Having all these items and money, means that Minh has a target on his back, and he has no Escape skill, so he will always lose something when he fights
[0:35:39] <Shishi1205> If the game can he will fuck with minh, If he lands on a yellow space we will see
[0:35:42] <%Solidnick18> kill minh probably
[0:35:48] <%gatorafan> Drug the entire planet Minh!
[0:35:52] <%paladinstarbuster> reggie you MUST warp to Bakout
[0:35:54] <Camail> minh deserves the win, being the only one to consistently play well
[0:35:56] <%nothuzad> I think minh is clearly the weakest fighter
[0:36:05] <Tuna_Can_0> I-I dont want this series to end FeelsBadMan
[0:36:13] <Aydarkzero> who's the strongest?
[0:36:16] <%yeetdabsenpai69> ATTACK MINH AND TAKE HIS STUFF
[0:36:19] <VERDAXY> kill the boy
[0:36:20] <WiredAbyss> woolieOMG_SG
[0:36:26] <%jiggy_snipe> he's the weakest figher and his class doesn't give a benefit for combat outside of gold
[0:36:26] <+MrAtheGreat> @aydarkzero Woolie
[0:36:31] <%Grayhammatter> oh god
[0:36:31] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie and Woolie need to team up
[0:36:32] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie is probably the best right now
[0:36:32] <andrei11dr> If i were Minh i would've thrown a Death Call on one of them before entering, but it's to late now
[0:36:35] <Shishi1205> He's broke tho
[0:36:45] <%nothuzad> Aydarkzero woolie is probably the strongest fighter - but reggie aint weak either
[0:36:49] <+Invlux> This game is schadenfreude crack, I don't want it to end either
[0:36:54] <%yeetdabsenpai69> but he is better build for endgame
[0:36:59] <+Gespens> Reggie is the scariest person to fight though, because RUST
[0:36:59] <$JobbedBone> CALCULUS
[0:36:59] <morningmoondude> The real solution is to go to the kitchen and grab a knife, woolie
[0:37:00] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @shishi1205 He can get that money right back
[0:37:03] <Shishi1205> As soon as minh gets out sqall
[0:37:10] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie has the mixups and raw power
[0:37:12] <+Gespens> Not in the tower @Shishi1205
[0:37:12] <Shishi1205> Can he against the monsters there?
[0:37:12] <Aydarkzero> nice
[0:37:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Master your class to close the gap Woolie!
[0:37:23] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> I don’t see why not
[0:37:27] <andrei11dr> And his speed might hit the 200 mark, that is actually godlike, nothing will hit him
[0:37:29] <Shishi1205> He got a field warp
[0:37:36] <+xerotwo> YOINK
[0:37:39] <%Grayhammatter> YOINK
[0:37:46] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Minh you got this i totally have faith in you
[0:37:51] <Camail> no one can hit minh with field magic, he can leave and be fine
[0:37:59] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Kappa
[0:37:59] <Camail> he can steal all the towns
[0:38:06] <+MrAtheGreat> Fight!
[0:38:06] <Shishi1205> Rough
[0:38:11] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie grind and master!
[0:38:14] <%Daba_mk2> coward minh
[0:38:16] <%nothuzad> well currently minh is in the tower so no town stealing etc
[0:38:17] <%Grayhammatter> he's gonna steal your towns
[0:38:17] <andrei11dr> Minh team all the fucking way
[0:38:18] <%Nekros4442> Wasnt Minh going for Hero?
[0:38:22] <%yeetdabsenpai69> LOOP
[0:38:32] <bitterssweets> watch Reggie OOPS his way to the win
[0:38:35] <Camail> Nekros4442 he stopped that plan a few sessions ago
[0:38:35] <%Kriss1827> minh is totally gonna steal those towns huh
[0:38:36] <%gearcannon> Woolie should just darkling to stop minh taking his towns
[0:38:37] <Jetsfantasy> Minh gonna cash in that Money in the Bank contract when everyone's worn out
[0:38:37] <%Ecchigun> we here
[0:38:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Nekros4442 Yes but he lost the wings
[0:38:40] <%Quigsies> Minh is the hero, unbound by morality
[0:38:55] <Shishi1205> Go for makuta anyway
[0:38:56] <%yeetdabsenpai69> LOOP

[0:42:43] <+Yopomo> SHIEEEEET
[0:42:50] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @commandersqueaks Did he though? That seems a bit planned to me
[0:42:51] <zocano> like for real, just hunt Minh's ass down constantly and just keep taking towns
[0:42:53] <+lucaflowe> does it matter, doesn't woolie still have darkling bat?
[0:42:58] <morningmoondude> what hppened?
[0:43:02] <Drywall_Thief> Woo! I can finally be a Manga reader vs an Anime lad!
[0:43:03] <%nothuzad> darklin can always equalize things
[0:43:08] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie really needs to just go dark at this point
[0:43:11] <bitterssweets> darkington is the only way to stop mihn
[0:43:17] <Drywall_Thief> We need an All Darklings run
[0:43:17] <+mrcooperblack> woolie does have the darkling bat i thought
[0:43:19] <Shishi1205> Why is Reggie going for vanishes when he has to rely already on spellword rng
[0:43:20] <Camail> ShadowpulseKDH1 if you want to beleive minh is cum and looked up shop items go ahead, just know that's stupid
[0:43:23] <+Gespens> REggie, don't VANISH
[0:43:23] <+Yopomo> is minh an alchemist?
[0:43:25] <Camail> scum*
[0:43:25] <%jiggy_snipe> EXACTLY
[0:43:28] <%jiggy_snipe> RISK IT
[0:43:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @shishi1205 No Trust
[0:43:30] <+Yopomo> if he is
[0:43:31] <+lucaflowe> Woolie can go darkling and drop monsters on every single town
[0:43:32] <Klefth> YOU'RE PLAYING YOUSELF
[0:43:32] <+Yopomo> oh god
[0:43:32] <%Rolandknight> so watching it live is the reading the manga and watching this on youtube, is the anime, right?
[0:43:33] <%Grayhammatter> REGGIE STOP

[0:43:54] <+IamScorpius> LUL
[0:43:54] <%nothuzad> lul
[0:43:55] <+MrAtheGreat> That’s Woolie’s problem. He gets focused on one and only one aspect of the game and believes it will lead him to victory, when it ends up betraying him later down teh line.
[0:43:55] <%papertoonz1414> LUL

[0:44:30] <%papertoonz1414> BLOOD CHEST
[0:44:30] <+MrAtheGreat> He hoarded money instead of spending, Reggie defeated him and used it to become the strongest of them.

[0:44:32] <%C4m3r0n0409> NOOOOO

[0:44:39] <Camail> Coward.

[0:44:57] <%yeetdabsenpai69> COWARDICE
[0:44:57] <+MrAtheGreat> He spent so much time boosting towns, and now he has none of them.

[0:45:55] <%nothuzad> this is B E A U T I F U L
[0:45:57] <+MrAtheGreat> He needed to focus on the smaller stuff that would hinder his enemies and bolster him over time: he needed to use magic and he needed to master his classes.
[0:45:59] <%Grayhammatter> he has no charm potions left
[0:45:59] <%yeetdabsenpai69> DARKLINGTON IT IS YOUR TME TO TAKE THESE FOOLS DOWN
[0:46:00] <+Billyuppercut0> Reggie this is your fault

[0:49:41] <%doombawkzvs> Woolie could've used dark if he didnt sell his contract for 1g
[0:49:44] <andrei11dr> Thank the Old Gods that im on Minh team
[0:49:49] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @TenguGemini so unstopable?
[0:49:49] <%papertoonz1414> @TwinBat Minhouse
[0:49:57] <%kekkerscrew> Why do they never use the strength boosts?
[0:50:02] <Drywall_Thief> Minh Bois
[0:50:04] <+Mendin> Because they never FIGHT
[0:50:33] <$JobbedBone> you should go into the fight prompt for every merchant to see their unique reactions
[0:50:33] <Camail> at that stage he where he sold the contract needed item slots more, and he took over the entire continent and didnt want to lose all his stuff
[0:50:48] <+MrAtheGreat> Sell ONE vanish.
[0:51:06] <Camail> vanish is his only defense
[0:51:07] <bitterssweets> time for the sunken cost mindgame
[0:51:10] <Camail> literally thats it
[0:51:11] <%yeetdabsenpai69> darklington take yourdestiny into your own hands
[0:51:13] <Drywall_Thief> Reggie at the end of this is gonna be that meme image of the guy in last place at the Olympics celebrating like he won all Olympics for all time.
[0:51:33] <$JobbedBone> the cat is my favorite
[0:51:35] <Shishi1205> Woolie please vanish before going out
[0:51:36] <+Mendin> At least the Peace Pool will buy the losers some damn fine pizza
[0:51:40] <Shishi1205> Please I beg of you

[0:52:31] <Camail> 6 is basically average
[0:52:34] <%Grayhammatter> reggie, you need MONEY
[0:52:35] <thesickestzak> @johndradical Minh wins
[0:52:37] <%nothuzad> JohnDRadical dokapon kingdom
[0:52:38] <Shishi1205> Fun fact there are invisible spaces in the map where a magic key is needed to open secret chests
[0:52:40] <+elbigante> I'm not worried because i know mihn is gonna get jumped the second he wins
[0:52:40] <andrei11dr> This is some true evil shit

[0:52:52] <Shishi1205> They usually have great stuff
[0:52:53] <RurouniGeo> wtf is reggie doing
[0:52:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie please level your class
[0:52:55] <nepwar> taking towns from him might save their lives
[0:52:56] <+MrAtheGreat> As opposed to by car?
[0:53:02] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> lytGREED
[0:53:04] <%jiggy_snipe> as soon as they learned about purse cutter, they should have been emulating MInh
[0:53:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> You were so GOOD last stream, don't go back to 0 IQ

[0:53:19] <andrei11dr> But teleporting requires money
[0:53:20] <Drywall_Thief> Reggie just deadass sounds like Eeyore in this game, goddamn

[0:55:07] <JohnDRadical> Oh shit. Is it for like the subscribed?
[0:55:27] <+Mendin> lmao Minh should sling a death call on Reggie for big fuckery
[0:55:28] <gyabs> Minh is POGGING up
[0:55:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> Mon cherie kinamaAyaya
[0:55:32] <%nothuzad> JohnDRadical no for the streamers
[0:55:34] <%Kriss1827> @johndradical ita donations
[0:55:39] <thesickestzak> It amazes me that Minh doesn't even have to try anymore to get Woolie and Reggie to go at each other rather than himself
[0:55:42] <JohnDRadical> Oh ok
[0:55:45] <%C4m3r0n0409> KILL MINH
[0:55:51] <%C4m3r0n0409> ITS NECASSARY

[0:55:53] <%fuji_92> thanks mon cherry
[0:55:55] <%Grayhammatter> woolie's gonna need to darkling soon
[0:56:00] <Shishi1205> ACtually minh has no way to avoid darkling/Boss encounters where give up is locked
[0:56:06] <Shishi1205> Not rn
[0:56:10] <royb2> wait did woolie and reggie again fight each other and just let minh walk away with the win
[0:56:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Thank you
[0:56:22] <andrei11dr> You should keep Death Call, you'll eventually duplicate enough of them to kill them nonstop
[0:56:23] <%nothuzad> royb2 no they bumbled around
[0:56:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sell that Vanish
[0:56:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> THANK YOU
[0:56:30] <worldbrand> they cant keep letting him get away with this
[0:56:32] <%jiggy_snipe> thank you
[0:56:35] <%jiggy_snipe> don't vanish
[0:56:35] <%Spydurman> Woolie's spirit is broken and Reggie is playing himself real hard. Minh gonna walk away with the win easy
[0:56:42] <%Livelinne> I just realized there’s a new emote woolieGIRLS
[0:56:47] <%fuji_92> @royb2 it wouldn't be a dokapon session otherwise
[0:56:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @spydurman He just sold his Vanish, so there might be hope for him yet.
[0:56:55] <+Mendin> Remember last stream when everyone was in spitting range of first place?
[0:57:01] <+Mendin> Cause at this point I've basically forgotten
[0:57:06] <MayorRev> this song is nice
[0:57:08] <%kingkeldeo31> But then Reggie's protag luck activates and he somehow wins
[0:57:16] <+Estuko> Minh hold strong and steal victory!
[0:57:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:57:23] <Drywall_Thief> HOES MAD
[0:57:24] <worldbrand> ptsdokapon

[0:57:26] <%nothuzad> Mendin dokapon is quiet a caustic game
[0:57:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mendin The game has shown that there's no such thing as an impossible lead.
[0:57:31] <Shishi1205> Nice
[0:57:31] <+Mendin> Minh is FIVE LEVELS behind how have they not b ullied him relentlessly
[0:57:35] <Shishi1205> Now for a heal
[0:57:35] <%Picia000123> I hear hoes mad each time I hear it
[0:57:36] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie and Woolie never team up
[0:57:40] <Shishi1205> One short
[0:57:41] <JohnDRadical> Can’t wait to see who’s gonna be the “Lucky Ted” in this stream
[0:57:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mendin Because he cowards out the moment they try.
[0:57:45] <%Spydurman> yeah last session it really was anyone's game. Some good moves and lucks could push Reggie or Woolie up but hard to tell

[1:31:03] <+elbigante> reggie is a much safer bet to battle in first place because he's not stable in that position
[1:31:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Is the Town Values in 'Assets?'
[1:31:07] <JohnDRadical> So is this Pockets related to the Pockets from SWTOR? Is she a long lost descendant?
[1:31:07] <BurningSaph> I believe in Woolie making the right choice
[1:31:09] <chambatron> Honest question. All these past stream have been the same game or they have started over at some time? How do you win this game?
[1:31:09] <Xeno351> minh can't fight
[1:31:12] <%Daba_mk2> take the one with the most value
[1:31:14] <%Grayhammatter> the town values may have assets
[1:31:15] <zocano> Minh is a better position to gain back traction
[1:31:15] <Shishi1205> Item is worth if you want to go deliver the one for the king
[1:31:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:31:19] <%emperordread> 3 or 3? The decisions woolieYE
[1:31:22] <+mrcooperblack> take a look at the bottom half of the map
[1:31:22] <+Mendin> It's very simple: FUCK MINH
[1:31:24] <%yeetdabsenpai69> LUL
[1:31:24] <Iwashi94> Isa? is there a Saix too?
[1:31:25] <Shishi1205> Isa is better
[1:31:30] <jubejube56> If you charm a town can you then upgrade it?
[1:31:32] <%jiggy_snipe> Isa is more
[1:31:32] <andrei11dr> Well, you're failing
[1:31:33] <+GrumbleGrouse> Like I said
[1:31:36] <%CursedNobleman> @chambatron person with the greatest networth at the end of the game wins. the chapter ends on some condition
[1:31:40] <Camail> never give minh anything
[1:31:42] <%ChoculaUltra> @chambatron yes, one continuous game. The game has like 7-8 chapters, they're on the final chapter.
[1:31:43] <Zbyrd0961> gravatt
[1:31:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jubejube56 Yes
[1:31:47] <%Grayhammatter> gravatt
[1:31:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Isa is the best decision, UNLESS if you want to fuck over Minh
[1:31:53] <+elbigante> Afford minh no breaks
[1:31:54] <chambatron> Ok thanks a lto guys
[1:31:55] <Camail> hard disagree
[1:32:01] <%jiggy_snipe> if you leave Minh in 1st, Rico will keep bothering him more I think
[1:32:06] <+Mendin> NotLikeThis
[1:32:06] <JohnDRadical> It's never too late to fuck with Minh
[1:32:07] <%yeetdabsenpai69> STOP FIGTHING BETWEEN EACH OTHER!
[1:32:07] <Shishi1205> Its better for woolie
[1:32:08] <Klefth> You need to start going for Minh....

[1:32:35] <Ritei> woolie is madara, reggie is obito, minh is black zetsu
[1:32:38] <%jiggy_snipe> also Rico attacks 1st primarily lol
[1:32:39] <%MisterArcanine> You have to knock Minh out of first place
[1:32:50] <andrei11dr> With one fight, Minh can get shit loads of money
[1:32:51] <Twistedwolfie> so much salt i love it CAN YOU TASTE IT?
[1:32:51] <%yeetdabsenpai69> CAUSE IT IS TRUE
[1:32:52] <nepwar> meanwhile south america is minh's colony
[1:32:53] <%CursedNobleman> Guys, of course woolie and reggie are struggling. They only play 1v1 games LUL

[1:34:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Come the end of the session, Woolie is going to be very confused as to why Minh is still in first.

[1:42:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> WAIT THE 4 CRYSTAL
[1:42:48] <andrei11dr> One out of 5 ,that is ridiculous
[1:42:51] <DXLelouch24> Minh has effectively been pacified

[1:43:33] <Klefth> I hope he gets fucked...
[1:43:37] <KyroDragon> @Meta_Yoroitoshi thanks for the tip!
[1:43:37] <Rykorr> man i really HAVE missed a lot since woolie is back to being named POCKETS
[1:43:38] <Shishi1205> Only one space and its near woolie
[1:43:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> The Big Bug is literally the worse item for Minh's playstyle, it's great.
[1:43:52] <+Mendin> oh my god I just realized: MINH IS STUCK IN AUSTRALIA
[1:43:53] <+Taglog7> Get into fighting woolie
[1:43:53] <%MisterArcanine> Minh is broke on a continent he can’t win on
[1:43:54] <%saltpiggu> @Camail depend on the item and when it was gotten in game. Later game items can be worth more
[1:43:55] <+Mendin> True Crime Moments
[1:44:00] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> np. happens to me alot too lol
[1:44:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Don't get baited
[1:44:03] <zocano> You actually have a lot to lose
[1:44:04] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Rykorr names reset after chapters, i think
[1:44:09] <%emperordread> Keep that bug well fed
[1:44:12] <Shishi1205> Stock up into bug eating
[1:44:14] <%nintega010> I hope woolie tries to get aurora
[1:44:15] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Why? While you have the big bug?
[1:44:26] <%nintega010> to be even more a threat to both
[1:44:26] <%xcompleasedad> He forgot about the Bug
[1:44:27] <+projectmanatees> @nintega010 aurora borialis?

[1:45:11] <%irfan_> woolieACCIDENT
[1:45:15] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @JohnDRadical
[1:45:16] <Shishi1205> The bug choses wisely eating magic
[1:45:19] <%emperordread> Use alchemy to duplicate Big Bug
[1:45:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Minh's friendship with Woolie over, Big Bug is now Minh's best friend.
[1:45:33] <Shishi1205> Nice
[1:45:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice
[1:45:41] <+projectmanatees> @CommanderSqueaks in this part of the country? localised completely within the tower of babel?

[1:45:56] <Shishi1205> If you're desperate try robbing her maybe you get guided warp
[1:45:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> Might as well climb the mountain since Woolie is getting in the tower
[1:46:04] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @projectmanatees rabble

[1:46:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> I feel store warp is better since you have a chance of getting another warp if it's a bad warp
[1:46:59] <%fuji_92> LUL minh's mind games ain't working today
[1:47:02] <JohnDRadical> wow Reggie really is far behind

[2:08:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Honesty would have been wiser to grind up towards the Weapons Shop
[2:08:01] <megamonmon123> big bug is the true hero of this game
[2:08:01] <JohnDRadical> Well those aren't terrible odds
[2:08:03] <Mr_Ease> man I wish woolie didn't get rid of drain

[2:08:25] <Shishi1205> Did reggie think there was a teleport????
[2:08:31] <zocano> apparently
[2:08:33] <%jiggy_snipe> lol could have got the field warp instead
[2:08:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @shishi1205 I thought there was too, fuck
[2:08:35] <unlimitedgachaworks> Reggie's 300000 iq plays
[2:08:36] <%nintega010> I would hope he meets rico
[2:08:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> If only you had a field warp
[2:08:37] <Camail> turns have gone hella fast this session
[2:08:37] <+nekodelic> you could have used the field warp...
[2:08:40] <Camail> everyone's hit their groove
[2:08:41] <%paladinstarbuster> it doesnt even matter reggie
[2:08:42] <andrei11dr> Will Reggie be the Hero the people want? Let's find out

[2:09:08] <Idon__> Reggie: "my goals are beyond your understanding"
[2:09:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> @C4m3r0n0409 Good question
[2:09:10] <CashewZero> rico is more common on the mountain, but he is still really rare lol
[2:09:11] <%kingkeldeo31> OH NO
[2:09:12] <JohnDRadical> !Cursed!
[2:09:18] <%emperordread> No one knows what the castle in the clouds can do besides level you up to hero - so it's worth exploring
[2:09:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Stonks
[2:09:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> If nothing else, Reggie is leveling up his class.
[2:09:31] <unlimitedgachaworks> What a horrible night to have a curse
[2:09:38] <zocano> you can only get to the castle with the wings so no castle for reggie
[2:09:40] <Camail> SO CLOSE
[2:09:46] <%nintega010> close

[2:09:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:10:01] <Camail> as long as minh doesnt get a critical mass, it's possible
[2:10:03] <%yeetdabsenpai69> TRAIN
[2:10:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Money at least
[2:10:05] <nepwar> @DavidDredd84 need to master 3 specific classes and have a specific item
[2:10:05] <%Solidnick18> more money
[2:10:09] <%yeetdabsenpai69> YOUR TOO WEAK ANYWAY
[2:10:17] <WizardofWazz> its why those crystals can be amazing
[2:10:20] <Zbyrd0961> need crystals to reach him reliably
[2:10:21] <Camail> time or 5 spinners
[2:10:22] <Lichzim> LUL
[2:10:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> getting better money roles

[2:10:28] <DerpioParty> Made to be hard. Kappa
[2:10:29] <+GrumbleGrouse> huh
[2:10:30] <unlimitedgachaworks> needed more spinners
[2:10:34] <%irfan_> or movement crystals
[2:10:34] <%jiggy_snipe> need a 3crystal
[2:10:35] <%Javaa01> At least you're getting good money out of your time spent there
[2:10:36] <andrei11dr> But the reward is worth it
[2:10:37] <Mr_Ease> Man if woolie kept drain it might have been so much easier
[2:10:40] <%hamahiroyuki> might as well get cash and grind
[2:10:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie you fool
[2:10:41] <Dave_VD> @nepwar thanks!
[2:10:41] <+MrAtheGreat> You gotta have all the crystals.

[2:10:52] <%Solidnick18> minh on his way to take all the towns
[2:10:56] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> a super crystal would be great
[2:10:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yeetdabsenpai69 Why, they are literally neck and neck, that's a terrible idea.

[2:11:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:11:23] <nepwar> just lame it out
[2:11:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> GOLD EXPERIENCE
[2:11:28] <%paladinstarbuster> there is nothing there for reggie anyway
[2:11:28] <WizardofWazz> lets go bug!
[2:11:29] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @CommanderSqueaks cause minh is a danger too woolie and i want him to be taken down :)
[2:11:34] <%nintega010> big bug comes in the clutch
[2:11:42] <Fuji808> How do you get rid of that bug?
[2:11:43] <%jiggy_snipe> yea I wouldn't fight something before a boss
[2:11:44] <+GrumbleGrouse> TEAM BIG BUG
[2:11:46] <+MrAtheGreat> If you die your money is wasted. Grind for levels/mastery @woolieversus
[2:11:50] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Woolie have you checked his stats yet?
[2:11:54] <WizardofWazz> #TEAMBUG
[2:11:54] <%irfan_> minh really did an oopsie by letting the big bug exist
[2:11:55] <+IamScorpius> Thank mew! ;3
[2:11:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, if that's the case you'd probably lose guarenteed
[2:12:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yeetdabsenpai69 So you want Reggie to implode on himself to take Minh out so Woolie can win. Okay, I can respect it.
[2:12:12] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @CommanderSqueaks thank you
[2:12:16] <Camail> MrAtheGreat he's not going to those spaces for money, he's doing it purely to avoid the fight to be at max health
[2:12:16] <Mikob09> t h a n k m e w
[2:12:19] <Camail> the money doesnt matter to him
[2:12:20] <Dave_VD> Yo that sounds sick
[2:12:25] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> absolutely not
[2:12:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> My RPG sense tells me no
[2:12:32] <Dave_VD> All in just this once
[2:12:33] <Xeno351> banish is great for your build
[2:12:33] <nachohangovers> Drain and swap don't work on story bosses, I don't know about banish.
[2:12:35] <Shishi1205> No cheesing
[2:12:37] <CashewZero> it does not lol
[2:12:39] <%Grayhammatter> that sounds like a no
[2:12:43] <andrei11dr> That is big gamble right there
[2:12:50] <nepwar> i hope banish hit rate is based on mg not speed or else fuck everything
[2:12:51] <+MrAtheGreat> @camail I know, but if he loses it will ultimately be wasted turns
[2:12:52] <%chickenhunter> Rico has Mirror here, no?
[2:12:55] <%chickenhunter> not bounce
[2:12:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> Magic not working on bosses is one of the worst parts of RPGS
[2:13:12] <+MrAtheGreat> It’s risky either way, I’m just thinking grinding would be the safer bet.
[2:13:27] <nachohangovers> @nepwar Magic can't miss, but if they use defensive magic its effect won't happen.
[2:13:27] <+spacehouse> Dragon quest is infamous for that Boss resist magic shit
[2:13:29] <%doombawkzvs> ResidentSleeper
[2:13:32] <%emperordread> What do you purr fur? DxCat
[2:13:39] <jubejube56> Mirror would work on physical damage too right?
[2:13:42] <nepwar> gotcha @nachohangovers
[2:13:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> You making us sleep right now Kappa
[2:14:03] <%xcompleasedad> Never Giga
[2:14:04] <%doombawkzvs> Minh must've used Sleepy on me ResidentSleeper
[2:14:11] <+projectmanatees> pixvCri no bully
[2:14:12] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Mihn now has a mind game of his own now.
[2:14:19] <%Solidnick18> thank mew
[2:14:23] <nachohangovers> @jubejube56 No, defensive magic's effect only activates when hit by magic.
[2:14:23] <%C4m3r0n0409> THANK MEW

[2:14:41] <+GrumbleGrouse> That bug is never going to leave
[2:14:43] <CashewZero> its wild that he hasn't realized he can sell off his inventory to get the big bug to piss off -_-
[2:14:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Well thank Mewtwo
[2:14:50] <%Grayhammatter> that bug is happy
[2:15:14] <+MrAtheGreat> Atrophy on Rico would be good, but you would need to attack him right after using the spell.
[2:15:15] <RurouniGeo> Field. Warp.
[2:15:17] <%emperordread> Daunting Mountain: The Backdown continues
[2:15:25] <f4ntom98> HOOOO WHY HELLO THERE
[2:15:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Wouldn't it be great if the Bug became a boss if it ate enough?

[2:56:17] <T_Sasquatch> Are they in the endgame ? This area looks really different
[2:56:18] <%chickenhunter> darkling-ing to steal a town is still viable this late but its a race against how fast the others are trying to clear Heck
[2:56:21] <%primax104> just started watching, did they get to the tower with rico?
[2:56:24] <%Grayhammatter> nitro time
[2:56:24] <%yeetdabsenpai69> powerpoke insta kill
[2:56:26] <tenocci> Guys, I made a website where you, too, can get your own Pass
[2:56:27] <%chickenhunter> err, to steal a castle*
[2:56:36] <Shishi1205> The animation has a second part
[2:56:38] <%Grayhammatter> POWER POKE
[2:56:40] <%Riottrio> and make all towns available
[2:56:42] <%C4m3r0n0409> scaryyy
[2:56:44] <tenocci> Problem: I don't know if it's ok to post
[2:56:44] <andrei11dr> They beat the first version of Rico
[2:56:44] <%Riottrio> or at least a lot
[2:56:45] <%CursedNobleman> BANCHO
[2:56:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Roll a 2
[2:56:56] <%xcompleasedad> TOWNS
[2:56:56] <%Livelinne> @primax104 They did. Now is the last chapter
[2:56:57] <%C4m3r0n0409> Minh can still win
[2:56:58] <tenocci> Mods, can I post a url?
[2:57:02] <%chickenhunter> yea but if youre a darkling you're not racing to beat Heck
[2:57:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> 1 LUL
[2:57:15] <%primax104> @livelinne cool, thanks
[2:57:16] <MaverickJoker> You can feel BLOOD in the AIR, now that we're so close to the End LUL
[2:57:18] <Shishi1205> You risking
[2:57:20] <%C4m3r0n0409> Minh just needs Charm potions
[2:57:20] <%Grayhammatter> get those job level ups
[2:57:22] <%Solidnick18> 0
[2:57:23] <%nintega010> grinding should be priority now cause I don't think they are strong enough
[2:57:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's kind of prophetic that Reggie was forced to go back to Africa so many times during this game.
[2:57:29] <%Riottrio> being as non-spoilery as possible, none of them really have the ability to clear heck at any decent pace
[2:57:37] <%Riottrio> this is a race with a false start
[2:57:39] <andrei11dr> Minh can absorb win here, and in fact, i have a feeling about it
[2:57:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> 2 or 3
[2:57:52] <%Superdandy96> The hustle never ends
[2:57:52] <momo25247> Had to do something what did i miss since reggies mitch
[2:57:55] <alexandrecau> attack the ducky see what happens
[2:57:57] <%Riottrio> all that said, I probably wouldn't recommend going darkling in all honesty
[2:57:57] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @Riottrio true but i feel like Woolie will do the best out of them
[2:57:57] <%Grayhammatter> woof
[2:57:59] <%chickenhunter> Woolie probably has the best shot right now at the Heck boss rush
[2:58:04] <Shishi1205> Go for it
[2:58:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @momo25247 He got Isa back
[2:58:06] <%nintega010> It's nice to see minh in last
[2:58:07] <%Grayhammatter> that's a pretty commanding league
[2:58:07] <%Riottrio> yep, agreed on woolie
[2:58:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Item
[2:58:12] <SGrim> Outpaced by 7 mil. woopsKek
[2:58:16] <Shishi1205> Item
[2:58:17] <%Riottrio> especially if he gets heal again as a skill
[2:58:21] <%C4m3r0n0409> What job does woolie want
[2:58:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Drats
[2:58:34] <%nintega010> @C4m3r0n0409 alchemist
[2:58:36] <%chickenhunter> alchemist duping in heck would be the most useful probably
[2:58:41] <nimu290> strike
[2:58:41] <+Bl4kDynamite> Alchemist probably to dupe charm potions
[2:58:41] <%C4m3r0n0409> Nice
[2:58:44] <%DensityD> naruto
[2:58:50] <andrei11dr> I feel like Minh is going to win somehow because this game is too bullshit for things to come out like they seem
[2:59:01] <%yeetdabsenpai69> it would be smart if they duped deathblocks
[2:59:05] <CashewZero> if an alchemist gets a revive they can clear heck pretty dang early lol
[2:59:06] <%C4m3r0n0409> Minh is going to win still
[2:59:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice roll
[2:59:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Imagine what happens if Mitch Digger digs in ISA.
[2:59:09] <%yeetdabsenpai69> but they aren't mart enough for that
[2:59:16] <%GenesisKnight> Duping charm potions and going on tour in Africa would be smar
[2:59:19] <%GenesisKnight> smart
[2:59:20] <Zayasu> can i still join team reggie monkaS
[2:59:21] <%nintega010> than after alchemists woolie can try to get roboknight
[2:59:23] <%C4m3r0n0409> All Minh needs to do is take a few towns from africa
[2:59:23] <%DensityD> !twitter
[2:59:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:59:24] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @tenocci
[2:59:26] <+elbigante> the game has to give reggie some kind of big reward for all the objectives he completed
[2:59:28] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @C4m3r0n0409 [X] doubt
[2:59:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @elbigante It gave him Mitch Digger
[2:59:44] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @elbigante the moey is the reward
[2:59:45] <%Grayhammatter> oh yeah, the side quests are still going right?
[2:59:50] <mushplush77> Yeah Mihn should probably try to rob a shop in hopes of a charm potion
[2:59:51] <%DensityD> what kind of mugen nonsense will there be tonight?
[2:59:54] <%yeetdabsenpai69> your supposed to buy weapons with it
[2:59:55] <%DensityD> LETS JUST GO TO SALTYBET
[2:59:57] <%C4m3r0n0409> @yeetdabsenpai69 Minh just needs to take a couple towns
[2:59:58] <andrei11dr> If Minh gets one Mitch Diggers, his set
[2:59:59] <BurningSaph> Yeah they gotta hook up my boy Cash
[3:00:02] <%chickenhunter> yea, its the castle dog picture sidequest right now which is the worst one
[3:00:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> @legacy0117 In the tower you can
[3:00:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[3:00:13] <%Riottrio> castle dogs suck
[3:00:14] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @C4m3r0n0409 1/4 of his towns will be taken away remember
[3:00:16] <%doombawkzvs> You can
[3:00:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @legacy0117 They literally bought 15 of them from the tower
[3:00:26] <%DensityD> i wish my hair was pink plastic
[3:00:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @legacy0117 Minh's already done that thrice.
[3:00:30] <+Bl4kDynamite> You can buy charm potions in the tower
[3:00:30] <%nintega010> @legacy0117 you can just at the tower unless it's closed now

[3:38:12] <%yeetdabsenpai69> don't do it minh

[3:38:15] <andrei11dr> It turns out MINH IS THE REAL FINAL BOSS
[3:38:15] <Shishi1205> You need like 1 week of fights for alchemy
[3:38:16] <%Damie904> for ez money
[3:38:17] <Mikob09> Don’t
[3:38:17] <%yeetdabsenpai69> you got so many towns
[3:38:19] <+nekodelic> KILL WOOLIE
[3:38:20] <Idon__> it was hype before but using it now will put you at such a deficit
[3:38:20] <%Picia000123> Reggie, just grind
[3:38:23] <%yeknomlive> @RurouniGeo cause if he gets alchemy he can get out of debt quicker
[3:38:25] <%C4m3r0n0409> BOOOBS
[3:38:26] <%Grayhammatter> just grind reggie
[3:38:26] <Electro96> alchemist is better when minh can't field magic
[3:38:27] <%C4m3r0n0409> BAIKEN
[3:38:31] <%jiggy_snipe> you need alchemy spell
[3:38:31] <%doombawkzvs> Just grind
[3:38:35] <%GrassCannon> he started thief I think
[3:38:38] <Zbyrd0961> he has alchemist
[3:38:40] <+NWannabe> darkling vs spellsword? what is the matchup?
[3:38:46] <%MisterArcanine> All Minh’s stocks are in towns
[3:38:50] <+pectusumbra> he's mastered all 3 base classes
[3:38:52] <%jiggy_snipe> @Electro96 true if no one is using field magic
[3:38:54] <%Pinkiefan> Dark Minh? I never thought I would see the day.
[3:38:57] <RurouniGeo> @yeknomlive he needs to go directly to africa and start grinding there like he should have done weeks ago
[3:38:59] <%Solidnick18> maybe grind
[3:39:00] <Shishi1205> You need some weeks to get alchemy tho
[3:39:00] <%nintega010> like that would put minh super low. Like Darkling doesn't help Minh well since he only has 1 castle unlsess he steals woolies latest castle
[3:39:01] <nepwar> he might need to risk it because debt is bad
[3:39:04] <andrei11dr> Reggie is pretty close to unlocking the good spellsword moves tho
[3:39:06] <Shishi1205> You will waste so many turns
[3:39:06] <%Solidnick18> idk
[3:39:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> @jiggy_snipe I love that that one Bug ended the Squall ARc
[3:39:10] <%Riottrio> Woolie is currently only one to be able to use field magic
[3:39:11] <+nekodelic> just kill Woolie
[3:39:13] <%insomniacCoder> reggie playing mind footsies against himself the whole lp
[3:39:21] <+mrcooperblack> one thing i want to see is *redacted*
[3:39:23] <%paladinstarbuster> FIGHT WOOLIE AGAIN
[3:39:24] <%Picia000123> Reggie, no reason to go alchemist at this point, you just have to either do the quest and grind
[3:39:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> BLOOD CHEST PogChamp
[3:39:25] <SiegeJay> Oh GOD THE MUSIC PITChED low for a second. It sounded horrible
[3:39:30] <Shishi1205> Or getting robbed by Roche
[3:39:31] <%Grayhammatter> BLOOD CHEST
[3:39:32] <+nekodelic> FIGHT WOOLIE
[3:39:33] <andrei11dr> Oh but he has Rust so never mind
[3:39:35] <%Riottrio> just hope for random event where they remove your debt
[3:39:40] <%Grayhammatter> rob that 1g
[3:39:40] <momo25247> The bankruptcy
[3:39:40] <%kingkeldeo31> bankrupt does get rid off debt
[3:39:40] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie, it is time to head to the Sunken Shrine and become... THE ROBO KNIGHT!
[3:39:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:39:43] <%C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[3:39:44] <%krispen_wa> 1G!
[3:39:47] <%SuperKirby24> 1G LUL
[3:39:47] <nepwar> no one has tried it yet but does the same debuff stack?
[3:39:47] <%jiggy_snipe> @Th3SmartAlec Big Bug and Spellsword told Minh to stop lol
[3:39:49] <%doombawkzvs> LUL
[3:39:50] <%Solidnick18> oh i see kill woolie and force debt on him
[3:39:52] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Hell if i know...or just beat Woolie!
[3:39:54] <+netrac> Do a DSP on the debt
[3:39:55] <%hamahiroyuki> from where?
[3:39:55] <Augus7717> 1G LUL
[3:40:00] <Zayasu> 1G caused the epidemic BibleThump
[3:40:02] <%doombawkzvs> Even the imp was like "Damn bitch you really living like this"
[3:40:02] <%SuperKirby24> put reggie in even more debt LUL
[3:40:05] <%C4m3r0n0409> WOOLIE RUN
[3:40:13] <%MisterArcanine> Reggie being a spell sword is what destroyed Minh
[3:40:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> @jiggy_snipe The game did a perfect series of unfortunate events on Mihn the instant he decided to Charm Woolie's towns
[3:40:23] <%Grayhammatter> the mindgame footsore
[3:40:23] <andrei11dr> Somehow losing that 1G hurts more than losing a lot
[3:40:28] <MaverickJoker> Just Steal all the Castles, Minh. Kappa
[3:40:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> STRIKE
[3:40:29] <%C4m3r0n0409> NOPE
[3:40:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:40:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Casual dodges
[3:40:49] <%C4m3r0n0409> THERE IT ISSS
[3:40:52] <Shishi1205> EASY
[3:40:52] <+Gespens> Robo Knight ACTUALLY makes the final phase easier
[3:40:52] <RurouniGeo> Roboknight is OP tho
[3:40:59] <%kingkeldeo31> BIG MOOLA
[3:41:03] <nepwar> watch every enemy in heck is 100+ lvl
[3:41:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, it is certainly possible...but that's a fair call
[3:41:06] <Shishi1205> BLOOD
[3:41:07] <Xeno351> RED CHEST
[3:41:11] <%DashXero> Big Give Ups.
[3:41:17] <+mrcooperblack> woolie could do roboknight though
[3:41:17] <%Grayhammatter> fair call
[3:41:19] <+pectusumbra> well you have to master alchemist anyway for robo knight, so who knows, you might get the chance to change your mind
[3:41:20] <Shishi1205> Alchemist is better than robo
[3:41:23] <%Solidnick18> robo knight i read about it's alright
[3:41:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Honestly Robo Knight was more useful in the Tower
[3:41:25] <+Ogsmashface> Blood!
[3:41:26] <%chickenhunter> its not worth the time investment at this point
[3:41:27] <Mr_Ease> unironic red chest
[3:41:37] <%doombawkzvs> Can't he go roboknight and just keep alchemy?
[3:41:37] <+mrcooperblack> its unfortunate but damn its time consuming
[3:41:38] <%kingkeldeo31> Enemies are 60+ i believe
[3:41:39] <Shishi1205> Robo only gives boosts to Def in level up and def is the worst stat
[3:41:40] <DiscoDur0> The Fall of Minh
[3:41:43] <%DashXero> Grand Theft Minh
[3:41:44] <Brandon__Brando> dont grind with level one guys you can level up faster
[3:41:46] <+GrumbleGrouse> Red Chest was the best choice
[3:41:46] <%Riottrio> might as well use time that other two need to recover to advance as far as you can
[3:41:48] <Klefth> Robo knight gets to have random multicrystals all the time
[3:41:48] <+mrcooperblack> Punished Minh
[3:41:49] <+Slowchamp2> roboknight field skill is random multi crysal
[3:41:50] <%agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Normally like you already know. The pace is super slow mid game which allows for more classes to be mastered. When I played I already master Alchemist by the time we arrived in south america. So I only had to master 2 more classes
[3:41:51] <SiegeJay> Woolie needs a timeskip arc to get robo knight
[3:41:53] <%Pinkiefan> It doesn’t happen in most games. The main way people do it playing with AI.
[3:41:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Right now Woolie needs to capitialize on his Alchemist ability, gets some spells maybe
[3:41:56] <RurouniGeo> Robo Knight has the best field skill though
[3:42:00] <%phatmac16> FALL OF MINH

[3:58:48] <%Jetzord> @Riottrio Because the Temple dogs took a vow of celibacy

[3:58:55] <someyounguy1> no woman no wail
[3:59:04] <Shishi1205> No health upgrade?
[3:59:06] <%Riottrio> @Jetzord thats legit, can't force them to go against their beliefs

[4:02:20] <%GrassCannon> It was great for Woolie LUL
[4:02:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @irfan_ In Minh's defense, the game punished him 10x over for his mistake
[4:02:28] <%JustYudha> Everyone can breathe lol
[4:02:28] <reonome> LUL
[4:02:29] <f4ntom98> That was a rollercoaster dudes
[4:02:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> That Dig
[4:02:30] <+Slowchamp2> minh thinking about giving darkling a chance?
[4:02:32] <%SuperKirby24> stonks for woolie go big up
[4:02:36] <jevichrono> the end game with Minh possibly becoming a darkling
[4:02:37] <reonome> never bet against the digger

[4:02:59] <SiegeJay> Dont trust those diggers over there!
[4:03:00] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie did real good
[4:03:17] <Junkles> yeah he used them right away
[4:03:18] <%Picia000123> Woolie played good until he didn't
[4:03:21] <Shishi1205> If you get a mitch in the whole Australia you'll be balling
[4:03:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie getting his ass kicked helped in the long run, getting him Alchemist faster
[4:03:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:03:27] <Shishi1205> No
[4:03:31] <Shishi1205> It was one revive
[4:03:37] <Junkles> minh is wrong
[4:03:39] <%Grayhammatter> it was a revive
[4:03:39] <Shishi1205> He had use them
[4:03:39] <%OldManDeckardCain> woolie wins this unless minh pulls off the greatest darkling
[4:03:43] <+mrcooperblack> Woolie took two australia towns
[4:03:48] <Zbyrd0961> he used those potions
[4:03:52] <%Picia000123> and then Woolie bodied Reggie for 2nd and 3rd time
[4:03:55] <Shishi1205> Woolie used 2 charms
[4:03:55] <jubejube56> Woolie used those turns ago
[4:04:04] <%irfan_> i want minh to win but woolie is on the road to victory big time
[4:04:09] <Shishi1205> One for his og city then The one Reggie had and he got Salty
[4:04:18] <+trippersigs22> Dont get comfortable
[4:04:19] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie can still lose he needs to kill Reggie and hope minh takes the other towns
[4:04:20] <+Dimfish> The last chapters pretty intense, theres plenty of ways for anyone to win at the end.
[4:04:26] <3rdRunner> What's the bloodpool at again?
[4:04:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:04:52] <Shishi1205> Woolie if you get a mitch in Oceania its done

[4:05:01] <f4ntom98> This game is amazing

[4:05:04] <MrKerb> Hoes mad
[4:05:05] <nepwar> hoes mad
[4:05:06] <pjbuster> hoes mad
[4:05:06] <%C4m3r0n0409> EXTREMELY LUCKY
[4:05:08] <Twistedwolfie> hoes mad
[4:05:09] <%DashXero> Read the shirt, Minh.
[4:05:11] <nubreakable> hoes mad hoes mad, hoes mad, hoes mad! hoes mad?
[4:05:11] <andrei11dr> If Minh can get Darkling before Woolie enters Heck then thi shit is could really go sideways
[4:05:11] <%nintega010> that's why I want woolie to go the the underwater ruins to get lost tech. he's gonna need roboknight for end.
[4:05:14] <%agumon9000> When this series is over, I expect like an hour talk of Dokapon on the podcast, an entire docket of how bullshit the game can be to make everyone hate each other and feel like an absolute monster
[4:05:15] <%doombawkzvs> There's only some many ways to handle a Digger moment
[4:05:16] <%jiggy_snipe> protag magic
[4:05:17] <Manwad> Lucker dog
[4:05:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Mihn, you could have gone for Rico but you chose not to.
[4:05:23] <+trippersigs22> You guys are all saying "Woolie can win if hes does x" you know there are two other people right?
[4:05:25] <evilaltruistic> the protagonist luck
[4:05:31] <nepwar> the biggest twist was that goddess of luck was favoring reggie this whole time
[4:05:33] <zocano> Hero's luck
[4:05:38] <momo25247> Protagonist luck LUL
[4:05:39] <%jiggy_snipe> but Reggie's Darkling's have poor luck
[4:05:45] <nimu290> all i hear is salt
[4:05:45] <%Grayhammatter> the protagonist
[4:05:47] <zocano> Luck and pluck
[4:05:55] <%SuperKirby24> reggie's darklings are terrible LUL
[4:05:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> @trippersigs22 They are in a position where Woolie will have the advantage for a week or two until they can move
[4:05:56] <%Jetzord> Reggie is the Fortune Arcana of this LP
