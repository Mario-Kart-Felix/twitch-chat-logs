[0:06:52] <TubeMan642> Ever heard of Melt Banana?
[0:06:58] <coreyyotto> The FLCL sequels were just needless. Like the original being a short OVA was part of the charm. The actual backstory isn't that interesting if you dig into it
[0:06:59] <eljuanito1989> BandMaid is 🔥
[0:07:00] <$Invlux> FeelsBadMan

[0:32:35] <+Liquid_Dio> Batchuks was how I got all of Fei's weapon skills in one sitting, it's super cheap LUL
[0:33:06] <Morbidmort> Custom, Masterwork Baseball Bat
[0:33:16] <%ChoculaUltra> is this guy the Lucius Fox of street fighting gear?
[0:33:19] <jorniev> YOU can find me at the... CLUB
[0:33:21] <%Asuterisuku> DRAGON - Kiryu - and TIGER - Majima
[0:33:25] <DSD24> Long Hua is nice
[0:33:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> ........fuck. I never realized how on the nose that is
[0:33:28] <1MadLadd> hot wife
[0:33:43] <majindusto> Her English is AWFUL lol
[0:33:47] <Leddy_at_Home> @Asuterisuku Pretty close but no
[0:33:50] <Crockettrockett> ... shouldn't it be Dragon and Dog?
[0:33:54] <Crockettrockett> or Hound?
[0:34:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Crockettrockett It makes sense way later
[0:34:07] <dukenux> Oh boy, CRAFTING
[0:34:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> This is VERY optional
[0:34:10] <+e_d__> this is extremely ignorable
[0:34:11] <%Lion_kun> cowards
[0:34:15] <+Ether101_Prime> This could have been better.
[0:34:16] <%aram909> you need to use this to get the ZAP GUN which is the way to beat mr shakedown for real
[0:34:16] <MyNameIsRasus> It's at least very funny
[0:34:17] <dukenux> When was the last time you seen that?
[0:34:20] <madtrixr> theres value to be had here, but its not too necessary
[0:34:21] <%Javaa01> Yeah this you can very much ignore on New Game
[0:34:22] <T_Sasquatch> No. Fuck crafting
[0:34:22] <Chichen> Crafting is for cheesing the game
[0:34:23] <Morbidmort> @Crockettrockett Majima has a Demon tattoo, though
[0:34:24] <MyNameIsRasus> Okay it's not that funny
[0:34:25] <+Liquid_Dio> it's definitely NOT worth the time investment
[0:34:25] <%Lion_kun> i crafted so much to get the CP
[0:34:27] <alvaroeltz> ok, but do you like pocket racing?
[0:34:27] <+johnnychopsocky> The Mission Summaries are amazing, though
[0:34:29] <majindusto> Well...I guess it would be "Her Japanese"
[0:34:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> This is a time sink, for little, LITTLE reward in my opinion
[0:34:32] <tsunderecactus0> This system is pretty fun actually
[0:34:33] <madtrixr> yeah the zap gun is pretty nice to have
[0:34:34] <%aram909> definitely craft to at least get the ZAP gun
[0:34:35] <%Lion_kun> BUT 100% THOUGH
[0:34:37] <+zanzibar_junker> They repair guns
[0:34:38] <brunoberserk> crafting is cool in some games
[0:34:39] <tsunderecactus0> You can get a lot of fun weapons
[0:34:42] <%aram909> then ignore crafting
[0:34:42] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> You can get awesome stuff but it's for completionists only really
[0:34:47] <Crockettrockett> I do appreciate the results screen for the weapon searches
[0:34:53] <valriot> This is one of the games few "lets not do this" aspects of the game. 0 is good but OOF, the pacing and progression is not great
[0:34:54] <Fkain23> aww that sucks i got in deep on this all the things
[0:34:57] <%Lion_kun> get the zap gun, woolz
[0:35:02] <+Kduff89> roo4 mahjong or riot roo4

[0:35:06] <MyNameIsRasus> I only did crafting in 7 really
[0:35:07] <%Asuterisuku> You hear his hammer on his anvil from whole maps away.
[0:35:08] <+CptBritches> May I offer you an egg?
[0:35:10] <$StaceMcGate> GET OUTTA THE KILN
[0:35:13] <%aram909> it seems this crafting thing is hit or miss for a lot of people
[0:35:17] <Leddy_at_Home> He is Shirtless infront of the stove tho
[0:35:17] <Crockettrockett> Wait till he sees Club Sunshine
[0:35:18] <+mundanelotus> Andre the Blacksmith pounding
[0:35:23] <fIashman92> The RNG on this is BS. I did this for hours and couldn't' get squat
[0:35:23] <%aram909> me personally i didnt really care for it, but damn that zap gun is super necessary
[0:35:24] <%Lion_kun> there are legit insane weapons you can make
[0:35:27] <%Asuterisuku> @Crockettrockett Shhhhhh
[0:35:29] <%ChoculaUltra> wasn't even his full power monkaS

[0:52:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> heard you talking shit
[0:52:42] <Ultimatefool> Save despawns him
[0:52:42] <President_valentine> heard you talking shit
[0:52:42] <CelestialCage> Thats helpful
[0:52:43] <%LastHazzerd> hoooOOO?
[0:52:44] <%Spydurman> SAVE SAVE
[0:52:45] <%eyezehuhh> LET's Go
[0:52:51] <+Ether101_Prime> Oh no.
[0:52:55] <notsoy> slugger heat move is super good but it otherwise kinda stinks against shakedown
[0:52:55] <dukenux> He saw you beat all these goons, and knows you got cash
[0:52:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh it didn't
[0:52:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YOURE APPROACHING ME?
[0:52:59] <%eyezehuhh> Kick his ass, young Majima!
[0:53:03] <brunoberserk> * teleports behind you *
[0:53:04] <%Asuterisuku> 6M Shakedown
[0:53:05] <Solidnick18> slugger is pretty good on him
[0:53:08] <%Spydurman> Slugger heat move is perfect for Shakedowns!
[0:53:11] <+trialbyrespawn> @MyNameIsRasus loading resets him.
[0:53:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> bullshit LUL
[0:53:20] <+xerotwo> TANK TOP BRUH
[0:53:22] <MyNameIsRasus> oh i see
[0:53:22] <%eyezehuhh> Liar
[0:53:23] <+MrAtheGreat> Alt fighting him in the Champion district is THE WORST
[0:53:23] <Solidnick18> no he has no money
[0:53:41] <%Asuterisuku> Slugger has some good moves actually.
[0:53:42] <dukenux> "I can't get my money back without getting closer"
[0:53:47] <$infinite_rotation> He’s broke for mr shakedown standards
[0:53:49] <CelestialCage> he retains damage inthink
[0:53:51] <+kewlmyc> switch to slugger and do heat moves
[0:53:51] <SomersaultJustice> you make mr shakedown go to the atm
[0:53:54] <President_valentine> slugger heat moves though
[0:53:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> Slugger hits the hardest
[0:53:57] <madtrixr> yeah i definitely seen him retain damage
[0:53:58] <+AbnormalVoid> SLUGGER HEAT
[0:53:58] <+Billyfig1> Does damage carry over?
[0:53:58] <+MrAtheGreat> You can switch to slugger for the instant heat move
[0:53:58] <+Trickyvic13> slugger heat action works on him
[0:54:04] <Redahoge10> if you want it, then you are going to have to take it
[0:54:04] <CelestialCage> You cab use slugger heat but THATS IT
[0:54:05] <Haarute> slugger is good for heat move and nothing else
[0:54:07] <TopLeftCenter> Slugger does let you block his moves safely, that part is nice
[0:54:08] <+Ether101_Prime> Mr. Shackdown keeps a bit of the damage you do to him in a fight.
[0:54:09] <lovesosa236> but slugger style Is how you cheese him
[0:54:14] <%TigerCatGo> TigerCatGo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Wassup. Woolz!! It's been super fun watching you play the Yakoozies, especially with Cool Man, Rock God Lil V Mills! Keep on Rockin on, the both of ya woolieYE
[0:54:14] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> Slugger heat action is good, but the speed increase from T3 heat is also strong.
[0:54:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @therare_panda
[0:54:19] <+spardanwarrior> Not all of it, but some damage does carry over
[0:54:22] <+FingaLights> This darksouls now
[0:54:22] <%LastHazzerd> that's a lot of chin music, delivered by ya feet
[0:54:22] <+ConLin_Arts_> Slugger was my go to style for Majima
[0:54:27] <$Holycow8498> You can do it
[0:54:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Switch to Slugger just for the heat move
[0:54:34] <+AbnormalVoid> Slugger is much better
[0:54:38] <arielanarchy92> I thought he just starts that way. Once you beat him his health increases.
[0:54:39] <therare_panda> why you fighting like this dark souls woolie
[0:54:44] <CelestialCage> Thug for Shakedown but i can use slugger for heat at least
[0:54:53] <+ConLin_Arts_> Doesn't slugger have a great block as well?
[0:54:54] <%TigerCatGo> Joining late; when did he get to Majima storyline?
[0:54:55] <+b_aleph> carve that bat in his head already, man
[0:54:58] <CelestialCage> All POISE
[0:55:01] <Redahoge10> no backseating even if it helps
[0:55:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @therare_panda he learned the fight like this
[0:55:09] <$Holycow8498> just no selling getting kicked in the head
[0:55:13] <+Ether101_Prime> Don't heat moves degerate the more you use them in the fight.
[0:55:16] <+MajorCrasher> @tigercatgo today
[0:55:17] <DisheveledSloth> @TigerCatGo earlier today, took an hour break then came back
[0:55:17] <+canseesea> he's still (rightfully) concerned about getting one shot too
[0:55:18] <CelestialCage> Poised to hell
[0:55:23] <DSD24> @TigerCatGo earlier today
[0:55:28] <+Mr_Pylon> Put Mr. Shakedown on Letterkenny
[0:55:30] <SomersaultJustice> I like the shakedown with the hat the most
[0:55:32] <President_valentine> heat move
[0:55:35] <+kewlmyc> It's just without using heat moves on him, this shit is going to take forever later on
[0:55:42] <%TigerCatGo> @DisheveledSloth Thanks! Darn, guess I'll catch the VOD later, to See Majima's GRAND entrance <3
[0:55:43] <President_valentine> ULTIMATE LIFEFROM
[0:55:45] <%cache_22> Woolie has not been using heat moves that often.
[0:55:56] <therare_panda> i mean heat move would be nice tho
[0:56:03] <+Billyfig1> Egashira
[0:56:03] <CelestialCage> First is like Hiroya?
[0:56:06] <Nekros4442> heat movsle please... Slugger has a neutral heat move
[0:56:09] <notsoy> Egashira
[0:56:10] <Jonny_Uppercut> Fedora Yujiro
[0:56:11] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie does not believe in FEELING THE HEAT
[0:56:11] <therare_panda> good job tho
[0:56:15] <%TheGohanSkywalker> Egashira
[0:56:16] <arielanarchy92> Yeah I go about these more boldly cuz I just enjoy it a bit more even if I get wrecked lol
[0:56:18] <%SainEdge> the other shakedown is the most relatable FeelsBadMan
[0:56:22] <CelestialCage> NANI

[0:57:53] <%Asuterisuku> Oh yeah, you can do this and go get all Fei Hu's moves right away.
[0:58:44] <notsoy> yeah slugger was definitely the first style i got all the special lessons done for

[1:03:01] <Solidnick18> thug
[1:03:02] <huskarl_zap> Woolie's couch type suit
[1:03:05] <$Invlux> Oh so the bus boys wanna fight huh
[1:03:19] <CelestialCage> It's wild how obvious enemy NPC faces became to me after a while
[1:03:23] <+Chronobot> You conducted business, ILL KILL YOU
[1:03:24] <notsoy> how do y'all think he'll like majima's third style
[1:03:25] <%Asuterisuku> _But you're not my customers._
[1:03:30] <dukenux> You're not a customer tho, dipshit
[1:03:30] <DianaTheAscian> are these her fans?
[1:03:36] <+bluestbee> Oh he'll love it
[1:03:37] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> They *don't even realize* how cool Majima is.
[1:03:38] <+canseesea> @notsoy probably a lot, since it's fast and broken
[1:03:38] <DSD24> All these NPC faces
[1:03:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> her tier 3 subs?

[1:04:15] <Morbidmort> This is like when Kiryu got expelled
[1:04:21] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> watch out for the walls
[1:04:21] <%jetjagger222> chinpira is such a fun word
[1:04:22] <Torgue_1> Watch out, they're gonna do you!
[1:04:24] <%Asuterisuku> Space is too small for Slugger.

[1:04:59] <AngryAsian5> DED
[1:05:00] <+canseesea> the guard break attack with the bat still gives me nightmares 3 years later
[1:05:07] <+MrAtheGreat> That last attack scatters everyone, but it'll bounce off everything
[1:05:12] <notsoy> part of why the bat-chucks are so good is because they DON'T bounce off walls like the other swings
[1:05:12] <Morbidmort> That guy in red is fucking dead
[1:05:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> "a dude with a bat"
[1:05:14] <CelestialCage> @canseesea Its so gruesome

[1:05:32] <dukenux> Slugger takes a while to start
[1:05:37] <dukenux> but when it does
[1:05:39] <$Invlux> ah so he likes it huh
[1:05:40] <+McSoliace> i've seen people who are horrible at this game beat it with just that move

[1:11:31] <+FingaLights> Fat EVIL
[1:11:31] <Darren716> He's one of the nicer Tojo clans heads honestly

[1:12:39] <+canseesea> I can't hate Shimano. He looks like a cartoon, he's great at being evil, and he does crime good
[1:12:42] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> even the dude in Daredevil who played Kingpin looks nicer of a guy

[1:12:59] <$Invlux> doesn't even have a mattress... just sleep straight on the floor
[1:13:00] <Ultimatefool> He doesn't have a mattress, he just sleeps on the wood floor
[1:13:00] <dukenux> He looks like he'd murder a guy with car door
[1:13:03] <@akuda_bar> genetic evil
[1:13:07] <+e_d__> born to NTR
[1:13:08] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:13:09] <CelestialCage> @canseesea He did the villain part well and his only real flaw was dying
[1:13:12] <GarbageNirvana> Shimano has one dimension and it's the fat evil dimension

[1:13:30] <+canseesea> @CelestialCage Early on in Y1 he makes one dumb assumption, other than that he's also always right
[1:13:31] <Redahoge10> Shimano looks like he would make a weird moist slapping sound if you'd hit him
[1:13:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> Shimano was too big to fit on the Naruto swing as a kid
[1:13:33] <+JustToWatch> Those are the eyebrows of evil
[1:13:42] <The7thCrownLessKing> kinda wish Shimano stuck around
[1:13:43] <CelestialCage> His EVIL EYEBROWS
