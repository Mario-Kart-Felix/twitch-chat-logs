[0:04:26] <%jiggy_snipe> yes
[0:04:28] <%jetjagger222> they're also the multiple fighting game machines in japanese arcades
[0:04:32] <%jiggy_snipe> the dark ages
[0:04:35] <Shardlab> The dark ages
[0:04:36] <majima666> to be fair, tekken was a thing too
[0:04:37] <+StooEsq> Deceptive Alliance
[0:04:39] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus This ALSO taught Capcom how to MAKE a 2.5D fighter. SF4 was crap in Beta and then they saw a Battle Fantasia machine and said "Copy THAT!"
[0:04:58] <majima666> that was around during the dark ages
[0:05:00] <wolfmech007> Man, KOF now Battle Fantasia. Sure is a grate time to tune in.
[0:05:15] <Darkdrill> Tekken daddyðŸ‘€
[0:05:35] <kokujin_> rumble fish
[0:05:47] <GeltonZ> @kokujin_ Rumble Fish was still 2D kinda.

[0:06:21] <SomersaultJustice> I liked the cat girl waitress
[0:06:35] <FlamingNarwhal> girls LOVE rpgs
[0:06:42] <%jiggy_snipe> Fighting Game For Girls
[0:06:43] <kokujin_> well, they're not wrong
[0:06:43] <SomersaultJustice> fighting games FOR GIRLS
[0:06:44] <GeltonZ> The game was also MADE by a woman. Well headed by one anyway.
[0:06:46] <Darkdrill> trick the girls they won't know
[0:06:47] <kokujin_> girls LOVE granblue
[0:06:48] <%Gogogolem> @WoolieVersus I can confirm bitches love numbers.
[0:06:58] <+b_aleph> Oh yeah, tat's the one thing every girl loves, RPGs
[0:06:59] <%jetjagger222> this stage is some treasure planet shit
[0:07:01] <SomersaultJustice> you have to trap them
[0:07:02] <FlamingNarwhal> ladies love numbers poppin up all over the fucking place
[0:07:21] <Phrickshun> damage numbers are the shit
[0:07:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AlteisenReiseZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Ahh Freed, voiced by one DAISUKE ISHIWATARI
[0:07:25] <GeltonZ> FUN FACT: Freed is voice by Daisuke Ishiwatari
[0:07:33] <kokujin_> Freed aka PIRATE SOL
[0:07:37] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Gachi: Taunt
[0:07:50] <GeltonZ> I think Gachi was a cancel system actually
[0:08:04] <SomersaultJustice> I wish this had a sequel
[0:08:19] <wolfmech007> agreed
[0:08:26] <maplemillk> Holy shit Battle Fantasia? I never thought I'd see the day again
[0:09:25] <SomersaultJustice> oh man, I love when move names have their own logos
[0:09:39] <+GalacticaPhanto> I miss Daisuke voicing Sol
[0:09:44] <Klefth> @GeltonZ Seriously?
[0:09:55] <HorseGum> LUL
[0:10:10] <GeltonZ> @Klefth Probably! What are we Seriously?-ing?
[0:10:40] <@Solidus_113> The voice fact I'd think
[0:10:47] <%Solidnick18> watson
[0:11:02] <+GalacticaPhanto> Yeah, that Freed was voiced by Daisuke
[0:11:29] <maplemillk> Those times must've hit different
[0:11:35] <GeltonZ> OH YEAH! The girl in charge of this game voiced the main little boy too. She was also the artist for this game and a few Guilty Gears (but not all of them).
[0:11:40] <fuji_92> that hp difference oof
[0:11:41] <FlamingNarwhal> Watson should be in blazblue crosstag
[0:12:03] <GeltonZ> @FlamingNarwhal Agreed.I have a friend who mains Watson and is a BEAST with him.
[0:12:15] <kokujin_> Watson is the shit
[0:12:46] <lbrownthedestroyer> The heat system is broken god i hope they learnabout it
[0:12:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> all dp motions
[0:12:50] <Klefth> Oh, sorry, I meant Freed's voice @GeltonZ
[0:12:50] <maplemillk> You know it's an Arc Sis when it has a catgirl
[0:12:57] <Klefth> Also, that character's just Obelix
[0:13:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> but dbfz doesn't have a catgirl
[0:13:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> yet
[0:13:18] <maplemillk> Then we count the days until it does
[0:13:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20
[0:13:23] <GeltonZ> @Klefth Ah! Yup! Not in Story Mode but in the actual fights it's Daisuke again. And the lady in charge of this game voices the main little boy character with the pet dragon.
[0:13:26] <SomersaultJustice> there's that one catgirl in the ToP
[0:13:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> i know
[0:13:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> but it'd be a wasted slot more so than a goku
[0:14:21] <GeltonZ> Screw that! I want Sorrel in DBFZ! But I'd be cool with Hop too.
[0:14:35] <+GalacticaPhanto> the zoning tho
[0:15:09] <@Solidus_113> Nero 0.2
[0:15:33] <+GalacticaPhanto> ice car beta
[0:15:35] <@Menitta> wtf is this music lmao
[0:15:43] <%jiggy_snipe> Arc System likes sword guys riding their blades
[0:15:46] <%LordSDB> Urs is a Shoto Kappa
[0:15:56] <SomersaultJustice> he's basically rex
[0:16:07] <SomersaultJustice> weird pants too
[0:16:38] <+jetjagger222> nyande
[0:17:11] <GeltonZ> YEAH MARCO! That's the one voiced by the girl in charge of the game!
[0:17:12] <kokujin_> ashley is the coolest
[0:17:18] <+StooEsq> Urs would wear Jnco Jeans
[0:17:19] <maplemillk> I don't think cat girls existed in the dark ages but they might have gone extinct like the Dodo
[0:17:44] <@Solidus_113> Does Marco have Charlotta moves?
[0:17:55] <Visored34> are they playing the ps3 version?
[0:17:58] <GeltonZ> @Solidus_113 Nah not quite
[0:18:05] <maplemillk> I think this is on PC
[0:18:06] <GeltonZ> @Visored34 Steam
[0:18:20] <Visored34> oh ok, thanks
[0:18:32] <kokujin_> Wait, if this is the steam version, why were they having issues capturing it
[0:18:59] <GeltonZ> @kokujin_ Because capture devices can be fickle beasts.
[0:18:59] <maplemillk> @kokujin_ Shit just be like that sometimes
[0:19:02] <+steelmorrigan> not all games capture equally?
[0:19:16] <kokujin_> I've streamed this with no issues
[0:19:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ashley is such a bishie he poses even when he gets thrown
[0:19:17] <GeltonZ> Heat Up is a power up, Gachi is a cancel
[0:19:19] <kokujin_> Strange
[0:19:21] <+GalacticaPhanto> I love these designs

[0:22:32] <kokujin_> This came out before Blazblue
[0:22:33] <maplemillk> So I'm assuming the guy on the left was to appeal to American audiences
[0:22:59] <kokujin_> so if anything noel is the copy

[0:49:07] <GeltonZ> Oh worth mentioning: The Steam version Netcode is WAAAY ahead of the 360/PS3 netcode. This was pretty alright.

[0:53:14] <%AlteisenReiseZ> ah, i got my games in
[0:53:16] <@Solidus_113> Every time Max practices Granblue, he has to do it on at least 3/4 frames of delay, because that online is wack
[0:53:22] <GeltonZ> @KingofFacade Nah not worth it.
[0:53:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't
[0:53:28] <+Dayube> FaQ Elite lag

[0:54:03] <GeltonZ> @Menitta Come on, buying, installing, configuring, and then getting online?
[0:54:05] <wolfmech007> player match boys
[0:54:09] <@Solidus_113> https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/battle-fantasia-revised-edition
[0:54:15] <SomersaultJustice> lol, last time by the time I installed the game you were playing you guys finished

[0:54:51] <GeltonZ> C'mon Hero Versus! I wanna see this!
[0:54:53] <bazz_tv> is this for fun?
[0:54:55] <SomersaultJustice> half life Kappa
[0:54:59] <@Menitta> I BOUGHT IT
[0:55:05] <+GalacticaPhanto> @bazz_tv for girls
[0:55:05] <GeltonZ> Red Earth/Warzard was an engine test, yeah.
[0:55:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[0:55:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ttue
[0:55:12] <@Solidus_113> quick download Menitta
[0:55:15] <+KingofFacade> red earth is dope
[0:55:22] <bazz_tv> wargods was an engine test
[0:55:22] <@Menitta> I need to pause the stream
[0:55:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> you do it menitta
[0:55:30] <SomersaultJustice> I want a sequel to warzard SO BADLY

[0:55:58] <%doombawkzvs> Hydron aww yeah
[0:56:05] <@Menitta> 50% lets go
[0:56:11] <+Rolandknight> I think he might need to back out and go back in
[0:56:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:56:18] <SomersaultJustice> I think if they expanded the single player mode for warzard into a full game for a sequel with custom moves it would be really cool
[0:56:18] <+GalacticaPhanto> Leo was dope
[0:56:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Capcom Fighting Jam
[0:56:50] <bazz_tv> cps3 was Warzard/red Earth then the versions of sf3 and it ended with the jojo games
[0:56:50] <kokujin_> Tessa was in SVC
[0:56:55] <%ChoculaUltra> do you think we'll ever see an SNK vs Capcom 3 in our lifetime?

[1:01:11] <kokujin_> Slayer is definitely the type of guy to name his son a feminine name
[1:01:15] <bazz_tv> he should say Groovie

[1:04:28] <Ranger747> Bye legacy
[1:04:49] <+hod_fareview> Isn't this game that inspired Ono to pitch Street Fighter IV to Capcom?
[1:04:57] <bazz_tv> swordyuken
[1:05:06] <GeltonZ> @hod_fareview Not to pitch it, but how to do the animations
[1:05:07] <twitchyal> @WoolieVersus So what are the odds of you all doing an Eye of Judgement salt party?
[1:05:17] <+hod_fareview> Ah, ok.
[1:05:25] <%doombawkzvs> Bleh, for some reason it's not reading my mayfly doing 236 inputs
[1:05:29] <%doombawkzvs> Always a fun time
[1:05:34] <GeltonZ> @hod_fareview During the early alpha of SF4 the game was garbage due to being overanimated. Then they saw a Battle Fantasia machine and said "DO IT LIKE THAT!"
[1:05:36] <twitchyal> @WoolieVersus I will send you it.
