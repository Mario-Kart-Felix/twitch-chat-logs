[0:02:08] <cj_art> me
[0:02:13] <%X2Eliah> It's literally the result of daytime being fucked because of work, kids etc xD
[0:02:13] <+PositivelyNick> This is so me :(
[0:02:17] <SunsetJack> My life for time.
[0:02:20] <hellkhat> day time hours suck
[0:02:32] <+Aeoneth> This is hitting me in a place that hurts
[0:02:33] <problemagic> what are we talking about?
[0:02:39] <haisho> oh hey that describes me too
[0:02:43] <reonome> i have plenty of control over my daytime hours but I still procrastinate anyway :(
[0:02:48] <DonatelloJose> I'm on the stream and I don't like it.
[0:02:49] <unclecorny> Revenge bedtime procrastination
[0:02:51] <samcast1> Damn, I came here for a good time, not for a wake-up call
[0:02:52] <%Nested_Dreams> Familiar, but mostly because I'm pissed nothing gets done around the house
[0:02:53] <+Aeoneth> I mean being conscious of it is the 1st step to actively fighting it
[0:02:54] <%X2Eliah> Revenge. Bedtime. Procrastination
[0:03:16] <+Aeoneth> Slapping a label on it makes it easier to fight too imo
[0:03:18] <Equirah> Sleep schedule goes "bye"
[0:03:21] <%X2Eliah> Yeah but how are you gonna fight it? If daytime sucks due to work then it sucks
[0:03:36] <@Solidus_113> It's that comic about a guy sorting his schedule
[0:03:43] <+ALazo> The owlturd comic
[0:03:46] <reonome> its like that owlturd comic where the guy removes sleep for videogames
[0:03:48] <+Aeoneth> If you think your not getting enough sleep it's just a case of forcing yourself to sleep
[0:04:04] <+Aeoneth> if you think you can live with it then yeah nothing to fight
[0:04:15] <%Nested_Dreams> power naps are not real
[0:04:22] <+PositivelyNick> Wake up for revenge SwiftRage
[0:04:23] <brachydios777> Hey guys
[0:04:33] <%X2Eliah> No but, if you get "enough" sleep, then your waking time is literally just work and eating food
[0:04:38] <reonome> power naps are real if you regularly do them
[0:04:44] <%X2Eliah> There's just not enough time left
[0:04:47] <problemagic> powernaps are just conscious down time
[0:04:49] <Equirah> @Nested_Dreams absolutely are, just not in the way people often talk about them

[0:06:00] <DatAsuna> yuuuup
[0:06:10] <+Dova573> This is me whenever I have closing shift at work
[0:06:20] <+Dova573> Because that mean my evening is gone and I hate that
[0:06:29] <+Dova573> So I stay up
[0:06:30] <Equirah> @Nested_Dreams that's your experience
[0:06:56] <problemagic> that'll get you fired at on office

[0:08:48] <time2getsweaty> Yooooo is that a Jake cup!
[0:08:49] <leith_aziz> oh, shit. Missed the stream till now
[0:08:50] <+PositivelyNick> Unacceptable by Sony.
[0:08:50] <problemagic> oh woolie brough out the good cups
[0:08:58] <@Solidus_113> PSP Go is the greatest hacked system
[0:09:03] <leith_aziz> Sony tends to get pretty cocky
[0:09:09] <DatAsuna> homebrew is your only recourse
[0:09:15] <brachydios777> Sony is screwing up this generation by screwing the old one
[0:09:16] <problemagic> Yeah this is absolutely anti-consumer in the purest sense. Steal Sony Games
[0:09:23] <leith_aziz> THEN they put the exclusives which is why I own a PS in the first place
[0:09:25] <commanderapathy> wow sony
[0:09:29] <+b_aleph> Morally justified piracy
[0:09:33] <%BusterRepukken> I can't believe Microsoft is the one who cares about old games
[0:09:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> arrrrg mateys
[0:09:38] <+PositivelyNick> Complete BS hundreds of games are being taken away and Sony wont even tell us how long we can download them
[0:09:52] <leith_aziz> This really makes me hope Arcsys does a modern JoJo game. Cause I missed the old ones
[0:09:56] <brachydios777> This makes Microsoft look way more consumer friendly
[0:10:11] <%KetsuoTaberu> it sure does
[0:10:14] <+Exicuren> Time to prepare for the high seas mateys
[0:10:18] <%jinking79> shit all those Jojo costume, poses and taunts gone
[0:10:19] <%X2Eliah> It all comes down to "DRM is bullshit"
[0:10:38] <leith_aziz> Well, Microsoft always has been more consumer friendly. Issue is that they dont own many exclusives. So I bought a PC and PS4 to get both sides as a consumer
[0:10:50] <$JobbedBone> you own nothing. everything is a service. get used to it :)
[0:10:52] <Equirah> see you in two gens when they do the same to the ps4 and ps5 LUL
[0:10:55] <leith_aziz> PC: get Steam. PS4. get the exclusives
[0:11:05] <%Lion_kun> Gamers should hit Sony HQ and protest.
[0:11:05] <%Atomik456> the high seas are a calling
[0:11:11] <%X2Eliah> yeeeeeee
[0:11:16] <brachydios777> You can even still by the old kotor games on the Xbox right now
[0:11:16] <+b_aleph> @leith_aziz you seem to have forgotten the xbone launch already
[0:11:24] <%Nested_Dreams> Also not a single mention of Sony vaulting the PS3 / PSP games themselves
[0:11:36] <brachydios777> *buy
[0:11:37] <+PositivelyNick> Piss poor communication by Sony on this and the audacity to announce it on a forum post

[0:12:36] <Equirah> don't forget the firmware updates for games that have already been pulled meaning even if you have the game you still can't play it
[0:12:40] <problemagic> Steal whatever you want now, and don't hesitate to steal what you want in the future. There's nothing to say they aren't already planning to do this to the PS4 store in 3 years.

[0:12:49] <%BusterRepukken> you won't be able to patch physical copies though and some games need patches badly

[0:14:48] <leith_aziz> @Only_Joshin: Working with the PS3 was so difficult that emulating PS3 games is not easy.
[0:14:49] <CappuccinoGuil> I just want them to hire someone named Bill, so he can say "Hi, this is Artesian Builds' Bill"

[0:15:24] <SunsetJack> Isn't it kinda almost muscle memory?
[0:15:28] <leith_aziz> Start with a combo that does the job. Then build on it overtime
[0:15:36] <leith_aziz> Thats how I did it in GG

[0:15:54] <%Seancicle> I think I see you
[0:15:57] <Josef_Stryker> You use the most basic combo first and then over time add on to that combo
[0:15:58] <cj_art> if you can memorize gta cheat codes, you can memorize combo strings
[0:16:03] <problemagic> deep and wide deep and wide its a combo branching deep and wide
[0:16:09] <JetpackMcQuack> SeemsGood
[0:16:13] <%Only_Joshin> @leith_aziz was Sony not saying that the ps5 could brute force emulation during the lead up?

[0:16:41] <leith_aziz> Only heard it from you
[0:16:46] <Lancaster_H> @cj_art but can i HESOYAM while getting comboed tho
[0:17:12] <time2getsweaty> ohhhh okay
[0:17:19] <cj_art> LUL
[0:17:20] <DSD24> Now I remember! Ace Combat 4 was Mobius

[0:18:23] <leith_aziz> I feel like Fighting games maybe should advise doing it like that instead of going for the hardest one. Kinda like with staple combos in Tekken
[0:18:40] <derap41> You're too big Reggie looks tiny
[0:18:42] <problemagic> You're not just memorizing a string, you're building a tool set

[0:22:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @keiganofastora yeah first day, about to go to take the body down
[0:22:21] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus think of it this way: you're choosing one piece of content over another. That's good.
[0:22:24] <derap41> INdivisible?
[0:22:24] <DatAsuna> I lovetales but it's a long time past it's heyday
[0:22:29] <leith_aziz> Juggle based? Sounds cool!
[0:22:34] <DatAsuna> 2000s was peak tales
[0:22:36] <DSD24> I'm trying to be as nice as possible in Disco but I keep bumbling
[0:22:47] <brachydios777> Bumble Cop
[0:22:53] <Solidnick18> hmmm?
[0:22:53] <problemagic> it's just too clunky
[0:22:58] <%Juriasu> is it the generic japanee fantasy?
[0:22:59] <leith_aziz> Could be personal. I know its beloved by many
[0:23:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeaah... Symphonia wasn't good in that regard
[0:23:12] <+TheotherKristian> Welp, I finished watching I think we're alone now and all I gotta say is... fuuuuu...
[0:23:19] <DatAsuna> I would say the problem with tales and other JRPGs is many mechanics aren't even in it until you get like 20 hours in
[0:23:24] <+DragonArt07> which tales game did you play, some are better then others
[0:23:26] <%KoopaPrez> Oooh, we talking Tales?!
[0:23:35] <Jaysky> Symphonia
[0:23:38] <%Atomik456> @WoolieVersus which one/ones did you try? cause the series is pretty hit and miss even for people into the series
[0:23:41] <DatAsuna> far too slow to introduce layers
[0:23:42] <+samuraiknack> Tales peaked at Tales from the Borderlands
[0:23:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Beseria, Vesperia, and Graces F are the real hot shit for combat
[0:23:54] <Solidnick18> i only played vesperia
[0:24:01] <%Atomik456> Vesperia's aged like milk a bit
[0:24:02] <%Juriasu> Reggie looks so aerodynamic today
[0:24:04] <DatAsuna> berseria is just okay inthetales pantheon lol
[0:24:08] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus If you're gonna play a Tales game, play Xillia plz.
[0:24:12] <+ALazo> Vesperia is horrible...
[0:24:14] <+Ornightz> They cannot fail this upcoming one or it's over.
[0:24:15] <JetpackMcQuack> Just play monster hunter
[0:24:16] <%Atomik456> you don't get proper dodge til endgame
[0:24:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Tales of Snoozeria?
[0:24:23] <%KoopaPrez> XIllia though
[0:24:26] <DatAsuna> Tales is also absolute LP poison in terms of missable content lol
[0:24:34] <JetpackMcQuack> They’re fine
[0:24:37] <brachydios777> Monster Hunter is the best action rpg
[0:24:42] <problemagic> hahahahaha
[0:24:43] <%KoopaPrez> Half the vocab in Tales is gibberish
[0:24:44] <Futurecity10> It’s been like 5 years since bersaria
[0:24:45] <problemagic> amazing
[0:24:50] <%KetsuoTaberu> lmao
[0:24:58] <DatAsuna> Yeah Tales has been on ice for ages
[0:24:59] <zerointelligence000> Tales of *murloc sounds*
[0:25:00] <problemagic> brassier?
[0:25:06] <%KoopaPrez> Tales of Monster Hunter Rise

[0:28:49] <$arcielardor> that must be the further beyond in the slider
[0:28:58] <zerointelligence000> do they ever talk about the horrible war crimes or murders they've committed or is their child's suffering more important?

[0:30:36] <%BisoromiBear> Give it a rest, Mullen
[0:30:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Nope i think the same
[0:30:43] <$arcielardor> kind of like the guy in the baby formula quest of like a dragon
[0:30:46] <dds333a> Might just be
[0:30:48] <%Euphbugg> they are both far enough on the dick o meter that does it really matter
[0:30:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He seems chill so far
[0:30:52] <%Juriasu> he doesn't though right? I thought he basucally was unemplyed
[0:30:53] <$arcielardor> she's working because she believes she has to to provide for everyone
[0:30:59] <jacknerik> How far into the game are they?
[0:31:01] <problemagic> they're just toxic
[0:31:01] <Solidnick18> will see
[0:31:06] <leith_aziz> I mean the guy seems pretty chill, but I dont know if he's the slcking type
[0:31:08] <%jepupu> jepupu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months!
[0:31:13] <leith_aziz> *slacking
[0:31:14] <CappuccinoGuil> I feel it's gonna be a little generic, though. Workaholic mom, irresponsible dad. Dad learns to be more responsible, Mom learns to be more present
[0:31:25] <Solidnick18> also we need more paper pieces
[0:31:28] <+vaderxyz1970> It's all comes back to that Cock Carasel
[0:31:30] <PanicSwytch> Is he a stay at home dad or is he just lazy?
[0:31:33] <problemagic> and we all learn to love each other
[0:31:33] <Solidnick18> or something
[0:31:38] <dds333a> Seems stay at home
[0:31:44] <CappuccinoGuil> He forgot his daughter's dentist appointment, though
[0:31:49] <+ALazo> At least those bumble dads have jobs
[0:31:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Hey, Homer is actually an ok dad
[0:32:01] <@Menitta> what i miss
[0:32:02] <%jinking79> Peter worst
[0:32:14] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I would rather Homer than Peter
[0:32:15] <Josef_Stryker> What category of dad would Stan from American Dad fall under?
[0:32:16] <CappuccinoGuil> @Menitta they rang one bell and are talking about who's at fault in the relationship
[0:32:19] <+kullumanati> Not quite Goku dad
[0:32:21] <leith_aziz> Well, Homer cares for his kids and would be fine with sacrificing his enjoyment for his sake. Peter, not so much
[0:32:22] <brachydios777> There is no contest for Peter being the worst Dad
[0:32:22] <zerointelligence000> From what we've seen the dad's pretty good at raising the kid (excluding teaching her to clean her room)
[0:32:28] <dds333a> It's the standard fictional formula of none too bright husband, and legitimately smart, but exasperated wife
[0:32:31] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @alteisenreisez he literally chokes Bart
[0:32:31] <leith_aziz> *for their sake
[0:32:36] <Josef_Stryker> Peter is just a horrible person in general
[0:32:39] <+projectmanatees> jerk ass homer
[0:32:40] <leith_aziz> *flanderised
[0:32:46] <DSD24> Then there's the Adam's Family where everyone's rad
[0:32:54] <Josef_Stryker> Flanderization is often the worst
[0:32:54] <Darren716> "Dear Simpsons, it seems Homer gets dumber everyyear"
[0:32:57] <miucsa51> YEP
[0:32:57] <%Carquar> @BisoromiBear Hey, thanks for the gift sub!

[0:33:10] <+vaderxyz1970> Gomez just really loves his wife
[0:33:10] <leith_aziz> Yeah, assholish Homer is just hard to watch
[0:33:10] <QThaGawd> peter griffin went from dumb dad caricature to a crazy sociopath
[0:33:15] <Darren716> That's not a question professor, but let's take a look at some clips
[0:33:29] <derap41> it has a name its called Flanderization guess which show it comes from
[0:33:29] <%sniffy77> i remember the cutaway where meg literally says hi dad and he shoots her
[0:33:41] <+NickHatesSnow> nobody gets it worse than Brian
[0:33:41] <brachydios777> Gomez was a good Dad
[0:33:43] <+samuraiknack> Peter Griffin is a canon pedophile
[0:33:43] <%X2Eliah> Oh so *that's* what happened to US politics
[0:33:50] <Josef_Stryker> That episode where Meg just chews her family out was great... and then they ruined it by having her think she has to be the punching bag for her family's sake
[0:33:52] <Josef_Stryker> Fuck her family
[0:33:58] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:33:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[0:34:28] <derap41> @samuraiknack So is Meg and Brian probably all of em
[0:34:30] <%jinking79> Brian the worst Dad too

[0:34:53] <Josef_Stryker> Like Britta in Community
[0:34:59] <+DunkinBart> I know It's Always Sunny is suppose to be a reaction to sitcom characters being nightmare people, but I don't think it goes far enough. Peter Griffin is so much worst that any of the always sunny people
[0:35:00] <CappuccinoGuil> I wonder if the game is tracking all the mini-games wins?
[0:35:12] <QThaGawd> i think youre holding 5 snowballs you dont have to get a new one every time but i could be wrong

[0:35:17] <leith_aziz> geez, I forgot Brian was a dad. He sucked at his job
[0:35:23] <%Abstract_Endurance> how many times has Homer and Marge's marriage been on the rocks only to be saved by some random event?
[0:35:24] <CappuccinoGuil> So it shows at the end. Otherwise we need to keep our own track with the vods LUL
[0:35:28] <JetpackMcQuack> Then she gets too competitive, he says something he doesn’t mean, fun all around

[0:35:47] <derap41> Ice balls suck
[0:35:51] <%X2Eliah> That's very common
[0:35:58] <Josef_Stryker> Stan Smith in American Dad at least tries to be a good dad, afaik, he's just misguided af
[0:36:06] <Blank9> packing snow too hard for a snowball makes it ice
[0:36:10] <leith_aziz> Can you say that again? I didnt hear it clear
[0:36:10] <brachydios777> Once that show joked about Meg cutting herself that’s when I knew that they were being edgy for edge sakes
[0:36:21] <Solidnick18> i remember when that happened too me and i got a big lump on my head.

[1:40:10] <dan_g_v> Woolie and Reggie gonna take a break to see Lady Demitri?
[1:40:11] <Equirah> most things are deep enough not to mess with you
[1:40:12] <%KiwamiKiryu> HOW DARE YOU

[1:40:55] <%Kalixas> COWARD
[1:40:55] <NeonBleu> the violent pivot
[1:40:58] <+TheotherKristian> That movie is a bad intro to Aquaman, all that movie gives you is "Look how hot this guy is"
[1:41:03] <theredfox930000> I wanna rock right I'm rob base and I came down
[1:41:14] <+SteinsApprentice> SteinsApprentice subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Thanks for all the ever-green content aaaand for playing disco elysium cause I probably would've missed the console release.

[1:41:28] <dukenux> JL Aquaman is my favorite version
[1:41:38] <dukenux> the cartoon i mean

[1:42:34] <Jaysky> In all this water the thing that kills you is lava
[1:42:35] <Solidnick18> is that lava. jumps in..
[1:42:40] <dukenux> @dan_g_v one that cut of his own arm to save his kid, if thats tge same guy
[1:42:49] <dan_g_v> I think so

[1:43:52] <%KiwamiKiryu> @dan_g_v The comic made it make more sense, Aquaman ends up being an enemy of state

[1:47:16] <@Menitta> I like the holiday hershey bars like the peppermint ones
[1:47:25] <tanarath> I think it's that shit ingredients = shit product.
[1:47:25] <%Lion_kun> Kinder Eggs are S tier
[1:47:27] <Broand> In ireland we can get violet flavored sweets on halloween, Like the FLOWER violet
[1:47:28] <DracOmega64> Bunny peeps are pretty good
[1:47:30] <+FrostedZaibatsu> I dont think the Holiday Reese's count
[1:47:33] <dbag202> People who don't like Candy Corn were never loved as children.
[1:47:37] <Jaysky> Not a fan of peppermint and pumpkin spice
[1:47:37] <dbag202> I don't like Candy Corn
[1:47:40] <aiutare47> Can we collectively acknowledge that Werther’s Originals are the one candy we’d present to aliens as proof of our confectionery superiority?
[1:47:45] <tanarath> Most holiday specific stuff is poorly made.
[1:47:55] <@Menitta> I dont like it now but candy corn holds a spot in my heart
[1:47:57] <%emperordread> @Broand Don't you guys get those parma violets too? The purple ones that taste like bonemeal
[1:48:02] <bear_breaker20> cadbury eggs are so top tier you cant even find them around easter anymore
[1:48:03] <%Lion_kun> Big Kinder Eggs for Easter are 11/10
[1:48:10] <brachydios777> Candy canes arw good
[1:48:11] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:48:12] <+thecosmicfly> How many people does it take to play this game?
[1:48:12] <Clundy> Nah Werthers Soft is where it’s at @aiutare47
[1:48:19] <@Menitta> Mostly because in October during band season, we would all get a big ass bag of candy corn and share it. it was fun
[1:48:21] <%Euphbugg> look at the pipes Woolie LUL
[1:48:27] <Jaysky> @aiutare47 They're good but their soft eclair ones are really good too. Also Raisen chocolates.
[1:48:27] <Iwashi94> Woolie pls
[1:48:28] <+QueequegTheater> Oh god, Reggie doesn't know where to go and Woolie thinks it's backwards
[1:48:28] <aiutare47> @clundy Heresy.
[1:48:35] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Candy corn just tasted like wax and shame
[1:48:38] <Equirah> @aiutare47 eh, they're more like general non-offenders
[1:48:43] <@Menitta> Kinder as a brand is great
[1:48:49] <@Menitta> Their hazelnut bars
[1:48:59] <Broand> big chocolate eggs use goddamn cheap chocolate though
[1:49:00] <aiutare47> @equirah They taste like warmth and seeing grandma
[1:49:00] <Equirah> kinder is ass LUL
[1:49:06] <Jaysky> Did anyone get to try those oreo chocolate bars before they hiked the price up?
[1:49:08] <@Menitta> no u
[1:49:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> kinder eggs were pretty good
[1:49:13] <dukenux> are we gonna have Soft vs. Hard Werther's war now? cause i know which side im on
[1:49:21] <%Lion_kun> Kinder bars are to die for.
[1:49:23] <+toastybites> @Jaysky those tasted pretty generic
[1:49:29] <aiutare47> @dukenux There’s only one side bud
[1:49:29] <%X2Eliah> Just follow the red pipe lol
[1:49:30] <@Menitta> @Jaysky yeah i had those. They were okay. Nothing too special.
[1:49:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> Everyone faces the disapointment of buying a cadbery's cream egg easter egg and the big egg isn't full of cream
[1:49:38] <+FrostedZaibatsu> The Easter malt ball eggs were good too
[1:49:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> tho i might be biased bc of the toy inside LUL

[1:49:44] <%Euphbugg> Reggie got it
[1:49:44] <+QueequegTheater> Reggie is right and ignored once again
[1:49:58] <@Menitta> the best chocolate candy is kit kat
[1:49:59] <%emperordread> #TeamReggie
[1:50:03] <Clundy> @frostedzaibatsu Cadbury Robins Eggs? Hell yeah
[1:50:03] <Jaysky> Ok good, I wasn't big on them either buit I thought the oreo things were good for the price. Now it's like more than a dollar and I'm like fuck that
[1:50:07] <Equirah> @Standard_Enemy specially the non main ones
[1:50:10] <@Menitta> nothin wrong with a kit kat
[1:50:15] <%Euphbugg> woolieKICKDAD Doing more work to save marriage LUL
[1:50:18] <dukenux> @standard_enemy better than rafaello and my obligatory christmas candy
[1:50:24] <Jaysky> I prefer chunky kitkats, peanut butter.
[1:50:25] <+QueequegTheater> Mellowcreme pumpkin is the superior form of candy
[1:50:30] <%Lion_kun> Kinder>Cadbury
[1:50:30] <+projectmanatees> yorkie is best chocolate bar
[1:50:34] <brachydios777> Okay, but what BAAAAAAARS!?
[1:50:34] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @Clundy yes!!
[1:50:39] <aiutare47> @standard_enemy It’s the candy equivalent of your aunt that pretends to be rich when your family is around
[1:50:41] <%X2Eliah> WHOAMENT
[1:50:44] <Jaysky> Dark chocolate kitkats are surprisingly good too
[1:50:44] <Zeif00> I could enjoy peppermint bark all year round tbh
[1:50:48] <%Lion_kun> But only boys can eat Yorkie
[1:50:50] <Equirah> chat, ginger drops
[1:50:58] <zenith0111> Big winter into big winter
[1:51:07] <%Euphbugg> LUL
[1:51:12] <+Standard_Enemy> LUL
[1:51:12] <+ja07sj> @Menitta nestle kinda ruined the kit kat chunky though, they reduced the chocolate to wafer ratio by like 30% but raised the price at the same time, feels like shit, wish we could go back
[1:51:16] <+QueequegTheater> Reggie doesn't know how to move and Woolie can't navigate
[1:51:31] <dukenux> Maltesers are great too
[1:51:38] <+MyshkaMysh> Ecco was fucking TErrifying
[1:51:38] <+Standard_Enemy> @aiutare47 Thats so accurate holy shit
[1:51:39] <Zeif00> Kreygasm the Ecco ost
[1:51:46] <+kullumanati> Game gear
[1:51:48] <Jaysky> Riesen chocolate caramel's are amazing, and Milk Duds.
[1:51:53] <+projectmanatees> what baaaar is woolie
[1:51:53] <$emptyantics> We’re gonna get a Woolie and Reggie kiss cam confirmed
[1:51:54] <Jaysky> Awful for the teeth though
[1:51:55] <%emperordread> Ecco was difficult af too, never beat it without cheats
[1:52:01] <+ja07sj> I wish Ecco was just the first bit before all the aliens take away your Dolphin buddies
[1:52:05] <%druupy_> I also remember it on ps2
[1:52:08] <%Lion_kun> Anyone miss classic Fanta before they took away the sugar and ruined it?
[1:52:16] <%emperordread> @ja07sj this guy gets it
[1:52:37] <$emptyantics> Because of Ecco we got One Oh Hit Trix Point Never and i’ll forever be happy for that
[1:52:46] <Jaysky> @Menitta Is that why it's not as good anymore? There was always something off.
[1:52:48] <@Menitta> Ah see Kit Kat is by Hershey in the States
[1:52:48] <aiutare47> @standard_enemy I greatly dislike the faux “decadent” chocolate aesthetic. Ferro Roche are suburban as fuck but want me to believe they’ve got a vacation home.
[1:53:04] <+Reverend_Roscoe> EXCUSE ME

[1:53:06] <@Menitta> Its Nestle everywhere else
[1:53:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Have Reggie and Woolie gotten a divorce yet?
[1:53:13] <Clundy> Ecco The Dolphin needs to be remade by the Maneater devs
[1:53:21] <+projectmanatees> lindt is expensive but good
[1:53:27] <@Menitta> oh Lindt is fire
[1:53:31] <Jaysky> @doomerskeletor13 Never if the book has anything to say about it
[1:53:51] <@Menitta> the crazy lindor flavors
[1:53:52] <Jaysky> @Menitta Depends on the type. The standard balls for christmas are great. Dark chocolate's the best though
[1:54:01] <zenith0111> So how about this video game? Super game of the year right?
[1:54:02] <+Standard_Enemy> @aiutare47 They taste so good that I can put up with the overtly grand presentation
[1:54:07] <aiutare47> @projectmanatees When I was a kid they’re was a Lindt truffle store at the mall in the city. Every flavor you could think of. Absolute heaven.
[1:54:13] <zenith0111> oh wait chocolate... yeah chocolates better
[1:54:24] <+QueequegTheater> Reggie do not think, just do
[1:54:27] <@Menitta> @Jaysky I always liked the mixture of white and dark chocolate swirl balls
[1:54:31] <zanzibarian_hamster> white chocolate is good
[1:54:32] <%Euphbugg> please Reggie nooooo
[1:54:49] <Jaysky> @Menitta Do they even have those? Never seen em. Unless you mean eating both at the same time
[1:54:56] <aiutare47> @menitta Peanut butter were legit the best
[1:54:57] <+samuraiknack> Kit Kat with peanut butter coming to laugh
[1:54:58] <brachydios777> I don’t like most Dark Chocolates
[1:55:15] <@Menitta> Peanut butter makes me die unfortunately
[1:55:35] <Jaysky> I didn't like dark choc much either, then once I hit 25 I started to love it
[1:55:49] <aiutare47> @menitta Inferior genetics locks you out of the best candy.
[1:55:57] <Solidnick18> Yes
[1:56:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yup

[2:40:40] <+Luna_Lux9> Spiders are important in a garden, they help keep the pest level down so bugs don't just eat all your plants to ratshit
[2:40:47] <Jaysky> @teefpal Same dev

[2:41:48] <%Euphbugg> Marriage saved by spiders
[2:41:52] <%hax_metatron> These are two of the most annoying people I’ve seen in a video game and should get divorced. Sucks because the gameplay is really fun!
[2:41:54] <+PapaGravestone> why would you call the thing you're riding and shows that it has some understanding of language creepy?
[2:42:00] <zenith0111> Wheres the music montage with a wholesome singer?
[2:42:11] <@Menitta> oh god
[2:42:12] <%Seancicle> VoteYea
[2:42:13] <dbag202> @zanzibarian_hamster Fun fact about spiders: even when spider sized they're scary AF
[2:42:14] <+QueequegTheater> @hax_metatron they ARE getting a divorce
[2:42:17] <MiraLangsuir> @PapaGravestone I think she was talking about the garden gnomes

[2:42:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie used to live in a land were monsters are real
[2:42:32] <CappuccinoGuil> @QueequegTheater oh you know by the end they'll be together
[2:42:35] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Too be fair, who likes being killed?
[2:42:38] <%hax_metatron> @queequegtheater And the game is not about them somehow using this as therapy to get out of divorce?
[2:42:39] <Jaysky> I hate em
[2:42:45] <%BisoromiBear> spiders with i frame dodges
[2:42:45] <+PapaGravestone> @MiraLangsuir ah, so she's completely right then

[2:42:48] <derap41> Jumping spider are freaking cute
[2:42:51] <teefpal> I'm not a huge fan of dying
[2:42:51] <+Jiggisnipe> plz share Woolie
[2:42:51] <%hax_metatron> These people suck and the ending sucks
[2:42:53] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[2:42:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuuuuuuck that
[2:42:53] <zenith0111> Jumping spiders feign death to JUMP ON YOU
[2:42:53] <%xcompleasedad> WOOLIE
[2:42:55] <derap41> they've got huge round eyes
[2:42:56] <zanzibarian_hamster> So what are the odds that these two are going to be more kindling keeping the dying bonfire of their marriage smoldering a little longer, 2:1?
[2:42:58] <drunken_lemur> Ah, Palmetto Bugs
[2:43:00] <+NickHatesSnow> yeah i know those
[2:43:00] <Tracazoid> Reggie just took psychic damage
[2:43:00] <%hax_metatron> Gameplay is great fun though
[2:43:01] <%livlinn> Woolie no
[2:43:02] <DatAsuna> I thought they all flew?
[2:43:03] <+QueequegTheater> @hax_metatron their daughter made a magic wish to keep them together, they aren't happy about it
[2:43:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Isn’t that all cockroaches
[2:43:07] <StebTheVee> Jumping spiders play coward
[2:43:08] <+Jiggisnipe> people need to know about the horrors of Grenada
[2:43:09] <QThaGawd> when you see the wings come out its the scariest part
[2:43:16] <+Standard_Enemy> Palmetto bugs in your shower are real life random encounters
[2:43:21] <+samuraiknack> I love Woolie Grenada tales
[2:43:22] <%Lion_kun> All cockroaches fly
[2:43:24] <friendlyfash> Did little V die or something? where did Yakuza 0 go?
[2:43:24] <@Menitta> "Smile for the birdie!"
[2:43:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Your courage is tested when cockroach wings comes out
[2:43:27] <brachydios777> @hax_metatron Jeez man
[2:43:31] <%xcompleasedad> THEY FLY NOW???
[2:43:35] <+QueequegTheater> @friendlyfash not appropriate.
[2:43:37] <silvergauge> the wing tech is unreactable
[2:43:37] <derap41> A lot of spiders can fly they use their silk as a parasail
[2:43:40] <DedlokPM> @friendlyfash check his twitter
[2:43:42] <+QueequegTheater> @friendlyfash go check V's channel
[2:43:43] <CappuccinoGuil> @friendlyfash check v's twitter, is all
[2:43:43] <zanzibarian_hamster> @friendlyfash Situation with his mom, he's going to be gone for a while
[2:43:45] <+Jiggisnipe> @friendlyfash check his twitter
[2:43:57] <MiraLangsuir> A cockroach once tried to fly into my mouth when I opened the window once.
[2:43:58] <friendlyfash> Ah right ok.
[2:44:03] <dukenux> that's beetles in general
[2:44:04] <%Seancicle> 🤡🚬 what the hell was that
[2:44:06] <coreybom> @samuraiknack Oh flying roaches are not just caribbean native. They RULE the south.
[2:44:07] <zenith0111> Ladybugs are cute flyers
[2:44:07] <derap41> Lady bugs are viscous killers
[2:44:12] <+Luna_Lux9> Ladybugs breed like crazy and you can get a crazy amount of them in your house in the summer depending on where you live
[2:44:12] <+paladinstarbuster> Ive grabbed one midair before. If you dont care about being gross you can just crushit
[2:44:12] <@Menitta> the duality
[2:44:16] <bear_breaker20> you just hate them cause you cant fly
[2:44:23] <MinersLoveGames> God yes it's the worse. The moment I found out that those wings weren't just for show, a whole new level of horror revealed itself to me.
[2:44:27] <prime_name> Remember that time somene sent a bag of Ladybugs to the Mailcast?
[2:44:27] <dukenux> they eat the little green bugs(i forgot their name in english) that eat your plants
[2:44:28] <%livlinn> btw, if you squish a cockroach they mostly spread egg, so not recommended wooliePOYO
[2:44:29] <derap41> Lady bugs fuck up plants and Aphids
[2:44:35] <%jepupu> Whoawoooowww!
[2:44:35] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus I live in a foresty area, spiders are my best goddamn friend.
[2:44:35] <OldManDeckardCain> roaches can accumulate white life but you DON'T want them to v-reversal you LUL
[2:44:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the only time a spider is scary is when i don't know if they're poisonous
[2:44:42] <aiutare47> Spiders are devilry
[2:44:44] <%Seancicle> it's more difficult talking about things you like
[2:44:47] <dukenux> so ladybugs are also good for your garden
[2:44:58] <@Menitta> I'm watching Jojo part 5 now and that made me think differently about spiders
[2:45:06] <+DragonArt07> black widows can be encountered sometimes in southern canada
[2:45:16] <Afrosamasenpai> LOOK AT THAT CUTE SPIDER
[2:45:21] <GarbageNirvana> I live in widow/recluse country myself
[2:45:22] <+NickHatesSnow> purple stuff
[2:45:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> wash off the purple stuff
[2:45:26] <Pelodance> we have extremely venomous recluses where I live. And they're pretty much everywhere
[2:45:27] <@Menitta> God, one time at scout camp, there was a black widow in a tent
[2:45:31] <teefpal> Camel Spiders are a bitch
[2:45:32] <zenith0111> @cobalt_phoenix_ Nature usually has its ways to warn us loke stripes and stuff
[2:45:37] <MinersLoveGames> The worst part is when you don't kill the roach with the first hit. Then it's a mad scramble to make sure they don't get somewhere where you can't reach them.
[2:45:47] <derap41> Jumping spiders are used to cure Arachnophobia fun fact
[2:45:51] <+Luna_Lux9> I mean spiders have their place, some can be dangerous so you should be careful, but they don't go after humans like those shitty mosquitos do
[2:45:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> I live in a place with no venemous spiders but I can't stop the reptilain part of my brain from chimping out when I see one
[2:45:56] <+Ragnakawaii> I always thought as a kid that quicksand was going to be a bigger problem
[2:45:58] <coreybom> @garbagenirvana Oh so you live in HELL. WutFace
[2:46:07] <@Menitta> Spiders are great as long as they dont kill you
[2:46:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @zenith0111 not if i can't see it bc i only feel something crawling
[2:46:17] <MinersLoveGames> I don't care for spiders, but as long as they're not in my room, they're okay.
[2:46:18] <CappuccinoGuil> Dude, the amount of mechanics they had to create for each level... I'm stunned
[2:46:26] <%SuckerPunchSyd> God I’m so scared of recluses
[2:46:29] <aiutare47> @menitta I had to do my survival merit badge in a forest filled with brown recluses. Got to sleep in a big ol leaf pile.
[2:46:36] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I found a dead one in my hair waking up a few years back
[2:46:42] <@Menitta> AAAAAH WHY THERE
[2:46:43] <zenith0111> @zanzibarian_hamster Dont they have to be bigger spiders if theyre not venomous? monkaW
[2:46:49] <Iwashi94> I can't unhear Jody Whitaker in May's voice

[2:47:09] <Solidnick18> i hate this
[2:47:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aren't brown recluses the ones with poison that just melts you?
[2:47:13] <aiutare47> KILL KILL KILL
[2:47:15] <+caramelatte1> nope burn it all
[2:47:16] <derap41> The larger the spider the less scary it is
[2:47:17] <@Solidus_113> not for everyone Woolie
[2:47:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh monkaS
[2:47:19] <+QueequegTheater> They're gonna eat her

[2:47:24] <%BestTeaMaker> daddy longlegs are harmless
[2:47:25] <aiutare47> @cobalt_phoenix_ Yes. Acid poison.
[2:47:28] <dukenux> well, as long as it's not huge
[2:47:31] <balthazar758> i can't look at tarantulas for too long.
[2:47:34] <MinersLoveGames> @cobalt_phoenix_ Yep, their bites cause necrosis of the skin.

[2:47:45] <%BestTeaMaker> tarantulas and daddy long legs are harmless
[2:47:54] <@Menitta> @friendlyfash it'll be a full LP
[2:47:56] <+Jiggisnipe> @friendlyfash full lp
[2:48:00] <friendlyfash> Sick!
[2:48:00] <dukenux> daddy long legs aren't even technically spiders
[2:48:03] <tanarath> black widows & brown recluses are aggressive & ultra toxic.
[2:48:04] <zenith0111> I had a Daddy Long Legs jump into my eye and I saw its face......
[2:48:05] <therealtacopancakes> I always feel bad if I get overcome by monkebrain and kill the spiders :(
[2:48:09] <aiutare47> @bestteamaker Sure, but my ape brain says burn
[2:48:12] <drunken_lemur> PEAHATS!
[2:48:19] <+FrostedZaibatsu> grandaddy long legs are harmless. Use to play with them all the time
[2:48:32] <derap41> We Zelda now
[2:48:34] <zanzibarian_hamster> There are real life mimics in australia that are spiders that look like ancient coins buried in the sand, further proof that austrlia just shouldn't b
[2:48:35] <zanzibarian_hamster> be
[2:48:40] <MinersLoveGames> @SuckerPunchSyd Oh yeah it was baaaaaad. It was just a little bump at first, then I scratched at it and it popped, and then a few days later the skin around it was swollen up, and then the veins around it started to turn red.

[2:49:05] <Jaysky> I'm all for letting spider bros live but if a spiderbro is biting me in my sleep they are rightfully going to get squished and I'll not give qa singular fuck
[2:49:09] <aiutare47> @zanzibarian_hamster Whole continent needs to be tossed
[2:49:22] <@Menitta> I think my least favorite fact is "did you know that daddy long legs are actually hyper poisonous but they just cant bite you?"
[2:49:29] <Pelodance> you can slap the little ones with the weed

[2:50:01] <+SladeClegane> Reggie not fighting is gonna make this tough
[2:50:07] <aiutare47> @menitta Isn’t it the other way around? They can bite you but since we are god sized the venom doesn’t hurt us?
[2:50:12] <+Luna_Lux9> I stand corrected
[2:50:14] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Spiders are cool OUTSIDE.. inside they have to die (or caught and released if i can)
[2:50:20] <coreybom> @zanzibarian_hamster Why does Australia like to make new, horrible tech for god’s wrath?
[2:50:23] <MinersLoveGames> Once had a roach fall on my head when I was lying in my bed one night. They're the brown roaches, the ones that feed on mold and stuff and just wander inside by mistake every now and then. Still, kill on sight anytime I see one.
[2:50:26] <Jaysky> @derap41 Nah, they were spider bites. Too big to not be at the time and they were in the corner of the room. Never happened after they were removed.
[2:50:44] <@Menitta> @aiutare47 it might be that. I always thought it was because their teeth are too small to break skin
[2:50:57] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @minerslovegames I’m surprised you didnt burn the house down after that
[2:50:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> TOGEMON

[3:13:17] <Rosewater_444> Woolie really using that autocombo
[3:13:21] <zenith0111> Garden? That's a mf forest

[3:13:49] <+NickHatesSnow> adults can like stuff kids like
[3:13:50] <+allups> yes
[3:13:50] <JeoDood> yup
[3:13:50] <+vaderxyz1970> Explain Cutie then
[3:13:51] <Darren716> Joesh DEMANDED relationshit be in the game
[3:13:52] <tanarath> Yes, woolie
[3:13:52] <Deko_> they go from lets divorce to cartoon dialogue LUL
[3:13:53] <Jaysky> Pixar film, it's for both?
[3:13:53] <CappuccinoGuil> How do you explain Cutie, Woolie?
[3:13:55] <Pelodance> dismember cutie as a family
[3:13:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> now kid, heres why mommy and i are divorcing
[3:13:57] <zenith0111> DIVORCE IS FOR KIDS TOO
[3:13:59] <dukenux> this might be just a case of the game being made in Sweden
[3:14:01] <derap41> ...Its this game for parents to explain divorces
[3:14:03] <%doomerskeletor13> YOU CANT EXPLAIN CUTIE
[3:14:11] <+Standard_Enemy> THUNDERSNAIL
[3:14:12] <+allups> like all good kids stuff it start the conversation
[3:14:12] <Solidnick18> snail race yooo
[3:14:15] <bear_breaker20> all kids swear behind thier parents back you should know this
[3:14:18] <+QueequegTheater> @Jiggisnipe what kids movie has parents brutally disemboweling their child's favorite stuffed elephant
[3:14:19] <@Solidus_113> squeeze your snail
[3:14:25] <brachydios777> Bet on rock
[3:14:28] <NeakGX> the swearing is so kids stay interested, clearly
[3:14:29] <BallzieO> i dont think the guy who said fuck the oscars makes kid content
[3:14:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's stylistically like a kids film because it's caused by a kid
[3:14:29] <Rosewater_444> I really have no clue who this game is intended for
[3:14:36] <Fibroidworm39> hey everybody
[3:14:37] <dukenux> i dunno if they have the same rules when it comes to "words that you can't say on tv" there
[3:14:39] <%doomerskeletor13> I think they just wanted to make a send up to the kids movie genre but also have jokes about shit and brutal murder
[3:14:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CLEARLY, you're supposed to use this game to explain to your kids why you're getting divorced Kappa
[3:14:43] <DedlokPM> GO BANANA
[3:14:45] <+Standard_Enemy> ENCOURAGE YOUR SNAIL
[3:14:50] <+FrostedZaibatsu> What is the rating on this game?
[3:14:50] <+Standard_Enemy> But not too much
[3:14:51] <zenith0111> @neakgx You have a bright future ahead of you
[3:14:53] <derap41> @cobalt_phoenix_ Makes sense so far
[3:14:53] <prime_name> I hate this sound effect

[3:15:11] <+QueequegTheater> HE HAD SUCH A BIG LEAD
[3:15:12] <MinersLoveGames> This seems like the kind of game that would get a T or E10+ rating.

[3:15:32] <%doomerskeletor13> This studio needs to make a party game
[3:15:32] <+NickHatesSnow> 43 to 0
[3:15:32] <+Jiggisnipe> @QueequegTheater everything but the subject matter of this game is kid movie (pixar/disney) I mean

[3:20:24] <Jaysky> Well honey, Mommy wouldn't let me weedwhack her
[3:20:26] <CappuccinoGuil> finish the game, turn to the kid and say "So Jimmy, mommy and I love you very much"
[3:20:41] <%doomerskeletor13> No I think Josef Fares just wanted to make a game on the style of a “kids movie” but still have jokes about shit and brutally murdering stuffed animals
[3:20:43] <derap41> An Amicable divorce is a success
[3:20:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oof
[3:20:47] <JeoDood> play with your "girlfriend" who cant play videogames
[3:20:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> they made up in th game, BUT WE WONT
[3:20:55] <+allups> dad lives in an apartment with no grass and mom is seeing people but she only cares about work
[3:21:12] <Iwashi94> so when does may get a judgment cut?
[3:21:20] <zenith0111> "We're divorced but once youre 18 it wont matter"
[3:21:22] <+Luna_Lux9> The game is less about the kid and more about adult relationships, I mean game time wise barely is actually spent on the kid
[3:21:22] <%doomerskeletor13> SCHUM
[3:21:24] <%gatorafan> Marriage (FINAL)
[3:21:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he said Fuck the Oscars to his kids
[3:21:46] <T_Sasquatch> Im just amazed this game is still going on
[3:21:53] <Iwashi94> there's one left
[3:21:55] <derap41> This does feel a bit like award bait
[3:21:58] <+Standard_Enemy> One moar
[3:22:04] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s actually wild how long this game is
[3:22:07] <+Jiggisnipe> yea i'm pleasantly surprised how long it is
[3:22:13] <CappuccinoGuil> G I R T H
[3:22:19] <+Luna_Lux9> the setup for the game is to focus on Cody and May's relationship, a lot of people tend to stop seeing parents as individual human's as soon as they become parents even doing it to themselves
[3:22:23] <+SladeClegane> Uh… bugged?
[3:22:24] <brachydios777> This feels longer than A Way Out
[3:22:26] <zenith0111> @derap41 It is doing certain small things really well but the overall game is just meh
[3:22:27] <+allups> as long as it stays fun
[3:22:36] <+allups> yes
[3:22:37] <Pelodance> a way out was about 4-5 hours
[3:22:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm impressed with how many games they managed to squeeze in this game
[3:22:40] <+ja07sj> impossible to not have fun with this game or you get $1000
[3:22:59] <CappuccinoGuil> it has SO MUCH shit in this game
[3:23:12] <derap41> @zenith0111 Yeah when it comes to games like this you need to make your point and not drag it out because it loses its impact
[3:23:21] <@Menitta> I feel like they didn't need to have the make the child cry bit to make it feel as long
[3:23:22] <+Standard_Enemy> In the corner

[3:43:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Hades blew up for sure
[3:43:36] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie didn't play Valheim so that doesn't count Kappa
