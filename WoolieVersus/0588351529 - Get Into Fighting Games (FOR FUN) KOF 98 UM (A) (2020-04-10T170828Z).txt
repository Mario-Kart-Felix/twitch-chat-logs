[0:09:27] <@Menitta> unpopular opinion, I like the style of the older sprites
[0:09:32] <Solidnick18> that's a great fight game

[0:09:49] <MoroseLoki> SeemsGood

[0:10:04] <Oak_bogle> You’re *
[0:10:10] <%jiggy_snipe> congrats
[0:10:22] <am_omega> Nah I get that, there is something great in the older sprites
[0:10:24] <@Solidus_113> I think you already gave that one away on the first stream I gave you the image LUL
[0:10:31] <powafull> damn I didn't even have the website open lol
[0:10:34] <@Solidus_113> The last on that list was Garou
[0:10:38] <%jiggy_snipe> bummed that KOF14 didn't continue using these sprites
[0:11:08] <+DreyfussFrost> It's annoying more games don't have that, because as far as colors go, it's REALLY easy to allow players to customize sprite color palettes.
[0:11:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:11:12] <silver64_> garou

[0:17:11] <RacistWakka> who lost the most?

[0:40:22] <powafull> Ballin'!
[0:40:24] <+vaporousTippler> Blue Mary would be a lot more fun, in general.
[0:40:30] <MattDemers> Fuckin' lakers colors
[0:40:31] <%zeroarturia> doodLewd doodLewd
[0:40:31] <+vaporousTippler> Cammy's already a weird cat lady.
[0:40:35] <MattDemers> @vaporousTippler Agreed.
[0:40:36] <Ace_Clef> GUESS BALL BABY
[0:40:51] <+vaporousTippler> Like, can you picture Cammy in a bar? Mary would run that place.
[0:41:02] <%Jetzord> We need a mod for Lucky to have a "Kobe" Voice line
[0:41:03] <MrJazzbo> hellbound
[0:41:05] <MayorRev> CHAOS DUNK
[0:41:06] <Froyuken> Ball is life.
[0:41:31] <am_omega> Again the American Sports team is criminally not used in the series.

[0:42:36] <MattDemers> The other dads have the same pose
[0:42:45] <%jetjagger222> heidern is basically big boss
[0:42:51] <KatyParry_FGC> ^
[0:42:52] <FlamingNarwhal> its the universal "i am a dad" pose

[0:43:28] <MrJazzbo> i like Kim FailFish every time chang gets hit
[0:43:30] <%winds_0f_change> They're B
[0:43:38] <KatyParry_FGC> chang is so charming
[0:43:43] <%jetjagger222> choi's dead
[0:43:47] <+nekodelic> Chang is cool and all, but loli Chang is the superior version
[0:43:57] <MattDemers> Kim best boy
[0:43:58] <KatyParry_FGC> Chibi Chang*
[0:44:14] <MrJazzbo> anyone in here play KOF All Star
[0:44:15] <%winds_0f_change> They're B.A.D dads
[0:44:21] <Froyuken> Kim's gonna rehabilitate team daddies.
[0:44:23] <+R_BChe> loli chang in kof all star mobile game is wild lol
[0:44:28] <FlamingNarwhal> Big man with big weapon is cool small child with big weapon bigger than their body is always cooler
[0:44:31] <silver64_> Heidern reminds me of Golan from FothNS
[0:44:39] <+MisterRaffles> Do you prefer Chang and Choi in the TKD attire or their own get up?
[0:44:45] <%jetjagger222> @silver64_ him and brocken from kinnikuman

[0:45:16] <%jetjagger222> fun fact: takuma (as mr. karate) is the one from KOF able to keep up with akuma
[0:45:23] <fuji_92> takuma too stronk
[0:45:31] <+KinnikuDash> I chose the right time to tune in
[0:45:31] <+MisterRaffles> I love the playstyle of Takuma, just wish he kept the Mask
[0:45:34] <MattDemers> YOU'RE AN DISGRACE
[0:45:36] <MrJazzbo> don't let Takuma catch you making a pass at his daughter
[0:45:36] <TheArrow_> jesus that fireball's got some speed
[0:45:37] <Sir_Blitz> YOU'RE AN DISGRACE
[0:45:49] <+MisterRaffles> The mask adds so much to his design
[0:45:52] <+vaporousTippler> Takuma's EX mode should put the mask on.
[0:45:52] <silver64_> @jetjagger222 Ooh, you're right
[0:45:54] <KatyParry_FGC> no sagat but there is a joe

[0:46:32] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:46:32] <MrJazzbo> Joe's a muay thai practitioner like Sagat
[0:46:38] <+PJSmooth> The Fatal Fury 2 reference
[0:46:39] <%Solidnick18> I love you krauser

[0:46:56] <artificiallynatural> damn what a sick ass theme
[0:47:00] <%jetjagger222> BLEETZBOL
[0:47:01] <am_omega> No he was not in OG 98.
[0:47:02] <MattDemers> I've always wanted to like Andy more than Terry, but he doesn't exactly give us a lot to work with
[0:47:06] <Klefth> Is that... BLEETZ BOL?
[0:47:14] <Froyuken> Andy "Super Celibate" Bogard.
[0:47:16] <KatyParry_FGC> @MattDemers Bad writing
[0:47:18] <+PJSmooth> The entire boss team was excluded from vanilla 98
[0:47:22] <KatyParry_FGC> The Better Bogard
[0:47:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20

[0:47:46] <+cheezy_snackz> Andy sucks don't @ me
[0:47:49] <Froyuken> Surprised at how good Wolfgang's English is.
[0:47:55] <brunoberserk> do a kaiser wave
[0:47:55] <KatyParry_FGC> @ him now
[0:48:05] <fuji_92> LUL
[0:48:05] <artificiallynatural> You'd think Terry's ninja brother would be more interesting a character but apparently not
[0:48:14] <KatyParry_FGC> bad. writing.
[0:48:17] <+PJSmooth> Krauser was actually voiced by an english speaking person
[0:48:36] <am_omega> You know if I ever become a pro fighter I would want a orchestra to play Deis Irae in the backround.
[0:48:39] <CasualAlohaFriday> But he's supposed to be German
[0:48:43] <@Menitta> he's a big guy
[0:48:48] <FlamingNarwhal> for YOU
[0:48:49] <%Jetzord> Man, I gotta ask my muay thai instructor when we're going to learn how to throw tornadoes
[0:48:58] <%generalve> how come no one cares for KOF 99 ?
[0:49:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> SPICY KICK
[0:49:13] <Sgww> if i take that mask off will you die?
[0:49:14] <CasualAlohaFriday> BJ Love was Krauser's VA, same as Franco's
[0:49:14] <fuji_92> we care, it's just that 98 is better
[0:49:14] <MattDemers> GEESU
[0:49:16] <+vaporousTippler> 99 added a lot of questionable shit.
[0:49:26] <silver64_> @Jetzord It's after you learn the Tiger Uppercut
[0:49:33] <@Menitta> I respect 99 for having THE BEST stages
[0:49:43] <KatyParry_FGC> throwing tornadoes comes with the hand wraps
[0:49:52] <+KinnikuDash> I thought the music changes with the characters in 98UM, unless the Steam version is different?
[0:49:54] <+vaporousTippler> I love Krizalid's stages and their themes. That first round is sick.
[0:49:56] <%jetjagger222> this aint SF
[0:49:59] <FlamingNarwhal> is it weird that I like Geese with the shirt more than shirtless Geese?
[0:50:06] <KatyParry_FGC> hayabu2Andy
[0:50:11] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> leave it to woolie to play a boss character like Joe
[0:50:12] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:50:13] <Klefth> Bruh
[0:50:18] <+StooEsq> ?????
[0:50:25] <+bladeofSorensen> @KatyParry_FGC jbxHello
[0:50:27] <Klefth> You don't know what you messin' with, child
[0:50:35] <@Menitta> THE RUGAL IS FRUGAL
[0:50:37] <KatyParry_FGC> @bladeofSorensen VoHiYo
[0:50:37] <fuji_92> did they play leona?
[0:50:39] <MrJazzbo> Orochi team PogChamp
[0:50:39] <powafull> That means there's a Christ of Martial Arts
[0:50:39] <Froyuken> KOKO DESU KA?
[0:50:46] <brunoberserk> pick omega rugal
[0:50:46] <am_omega> Wrong Rugal.
[0:50:49] <FlamingNarwhal> @powafull yeah its Christ
[0:50:52] <artificiallynatural> yeah Ikari warrior team was already played
[0:50:52] <MattDemers> No Maxima for the Canada factor :(
[0:50:53] <%jiggy_snipe> @FlamingNarwhal he looks much coolr with his shirt
[0:50:58] <+PJSmooth> CYS in the house
[0:51:00] <fuji_92> THE FRUGAL IS RUGAL
[0:51:01] <am_omega> Omega Rugal is the problem one.
[0:51:01] <Korgororo> SHERMIE Kreygasm
[0:51:05] <+BusinessGooseTV> I am told Rugal is actually bad in this
[0:51:17] <Froyuken> What's Shemie's deal in the series?
[0:51:26] <CasualAlohaFriday> There's base Rugal and Omega Rugal in this game, iirc
[0:51:28] <FlamingNarwhal> @jiggy_snipe I definitely think the shirt is a lot more stylish
[0:51:30] <MattDemers> Mai just jammin' in the background
[0:51:38] <Korgororo> she's a follower of orochi
[0:51:39] <@Menitta> GENOCIDE CUTTAH
[0:51:40] <Zarkusto> the new faces team joined the Kof tournament because they hated iori
[0:51:40] <KatyParry_FGC> shermie and the gang are all descendants of a god. they're also in a band
[0:51:45] <Klefth> This version has the best Rugal voice
[0:51:46] <TheGershon> There's something about sleeveless black tops that are just the best clothing
[0:51:47] <CasualAlohaFriday> Omega Rugal is the boss version, and he's pretty bullshit
[0:51:48] <@Solidus_113> CUTTAH
[0:51:52] <rcgama> he reminds me of Akihiko a bit
[0:51:58] <MattDemers> HYDRATE
[0:51:58] <fuji_92> yashiro is basically grapple akihiko
[0:51:58] <am_omega> Yo you gotta hold select for Omega Rugal.
[0:52:01] <@Menitta> I'm a big fan of Suit Rugal
[0:52:08] <+StooEsq> drink water
[0:52:13] <Oak_bogle> Man this crunch is so satisfying
[0:52:13] <+KinnikuDash> @froyuken Pretty much the same as Chris and Yashiro. Band Mates and Orochi followers, in '97 they kill themselves to revive Orochi.
[0:52:16] <Korgororo> PogChamp
[0:52:22] <zard9> Castlevania run in?!
[0:52:36] <Klefth> God, SNK really were the fucking masters of 2D stages
[0:52:38] <%jetjagger222> @zard9 on point
[0:52:43] <fuji_92> Rugal is pretty much Dracula
[0:52:52] <KatyParry_FGC> this is my favorite stage in the series
[0:52:54] <fuji_92> Shermie Kreygasm
[0:52:55] <gaberome88> psaWrong
[0:52:59] <@Menitta> daily reminder to look at that amazing imgur album of fighting game stages as gifs

[0:53:50] <KatyParry_FGC> yung justin bieber
[0:53:53] <+TomDanksEGOT> Man I wish SNK kept up with the 2d sprites instead of going 3d.
[0:54:00] <KatyParry_FGC> 3d less expensive
[0:54:03] <@Solidus_113> is this /ss/?
[0:54:06] <TheGershon> Chris got that SphereHunter outfit
[0:54:10] <+R_BChe> didnt sprites nearly kill snk
[0:54:12] <KatyParry_FGC> 13 was close to bankrupting the company. so we're told
[0:54:14] <@Menitta> Its so expensive to stick with that 2D
[0:54:20] <+StooEsq> nice time of day
[0:54:24] <petwisk> @jetjagger222 someone got it
[0:54:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:54:31] <am_omega> 13 bankrupted SNK AGAIN.
[0:54:32] <Froyuken> @TomDanksEGOT If they did that, they'd only put out a KoF every 3 to 5 years.
[0:54:34] <TheArrow_> 13 was beautiful. still is
[0:54:36] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[0:54:43] <Klefth> That Yun grab
[0:55:00] <+arcielardor> what's the bloodpool up to now?
[0:55:02] <fuji_92> best announcer, for real... I love the "LEDY, GO!"
[0:55:04] <@Menitta> I mean they are putting out a kof every 3-5 years now lol
[0:55:09] <KatyParry_FGC> speaking of 13. ppl should be looking out for SNK sales on PC. they happen quite often
[0:55:10] <+PJSmooth> Chris and his moonwalk
[0:55:11] <+TomDanksEGOT> Yeah i know its just a shame because there's so much love and detail in these games that just feels absent in the current ones
[0:55:26] <Froyuken> @Menitta You're not wrong. lol
[0:55:33] <BlackOrchidKI> the shota wins
[0:55:39] <@Menitta> Idk I think if Samsho is anything to go by, XV should be amazing, visually
[0:55:47] <silver64_> Femboy wins
[0:55:47] <brunoberserk> now pick the orochi versions
[0:55:52] <+vaporousTippler> It's funny how KOF skipped right from 11 to 13. Never seen a game do that.
[0:55:52] <+TomDanksEGOT> @Menitta very tru
[0:55:58] <silver64_> femboy bein Woolie Kappa

[0:56:06] <KatyParry_FGC> @vaporousTippler LMAO
[0:56:13] <+heyitsdenzel_> @Fujiwara_92 The announcer is Harumi Ikoma. Voice of King and Blue Mary
[0:56:19] <+KinnikuDash> Shingo, My Son PogChamp
[0:56:20] <Malik1002> kof 98 has online

[0:56:28] <%jetjagger222> harumi ikoma is like 95% of SNK females
[0:56:28] <Malik1002> ?
[0:56:29] <@Solidus_113> neat
[0:56:46] <Alseid> No he doesn't!
[0:56:51] <CasualAlohaFriday> Wait, really? I don't remember that.
[0:56:55] <BlackOrchidKI> Not with Duo Lon, he doesn't
[0:56:58] <fuji_92> @heyitsdenzel_ I knew I loved that both for a reason beside tits. .. nice
[0:57:05] <KatyParry_FGC> London March <3
[0:57:09] <fuji_92> *them both
[0:57:12] <+PJSmooth> This is the only game I've seen Eiji to the air kunai throw
[0:57:13] <CasualAlohaFriday> He's descended from that ninja from Last Blade, and he despises the Sakazaki family
[0:57:14] <Froyuken> That Nolkswagon in the back.
[0:57:14] <%jetjagger222> @woolieVS he's the descendant of zantetsu from last blade
[0:57:19] <brunoberserk> wrong , duolon clan is a chinese clan , they basically lin kuei
[0:57:21] <+heyitsdenzel_> duck king and todoh in background
[0:57:41] <+PJSmooth> They even gave Eiji Zantetsu's super in XI
[0:57:43] <Froyuken> @heyitsdenzel_ They're invitation got lost in the mail.
[0:57:44] <Alseid> Yeah, he's a descendant of that Last Blade ninja, but he's not related to the Hizoku, Lin/Duolon's clan
[0:57:44] <BlackOrchidKI> Look at Orochi sticking out like a sore thumb
[0:57:50] <+cheezy_snackz> whos shingo
[0:58:01] <KatyParry_FGC> shingo is kyo's sakura
[0:58:02] <%jetjagger222> @cheezy_snackz guy SNK sakura
[0:58:09] <+cheezy_snackz> oh
[0:58:10] <+KinnikuDash> @cheezy_snackz Imagine Dan and Sakura from Street Fighter combined
[0:58:12] <+vaporousTippler> Except Shingo kinda hits like a truck, weirdly.
[0:58:15] <am_omega> Shingo is Kyo's fanboy who is actually decent in a fight.
[0:58:21] <Froyuken> @cheezy_snackz Pretty accurate.
[0:58:21] <%Solidnick18> go shingo
[0:58:24] <%jetjagger222> and reads a guidebook in the middle of fights
[0:58:37] <+vaporousTippler> I don't think there's a fighting game character who tries even half as hard as Shingo.
[0:58:40] <+bladeofSorensen> @KatyParry_FGC I wish this game had the code mystics rollback treatment. :(
[0:58:51] <silver64_> Yuri Yorigami
[0:58:53] <Froyuken> Who's the Dan of KoF?
[0:58:59] <KatyParry_FGC> @bladeofSorensen dont give up hope
[0:59:01] <+KinnikuDash> Shingo
[0:59:04] <brunoberserk> shingo >>>> dan
[0:59:04] <KatyParry_FGC> dan i s2 ppl in KOF
[0:59:04] <BlackOrchidKI> Shingo @Froyuken
[0:59:16] <MoroseLoki> Lol Shingos Dan?
[0:59:19] <+KinnikuDash> Yuri is more Sakura, and even then
[0:59:22] <KatyParry_FGC> Dan is a joke character made from Ryu ans Robert in KOF
[0:59:23] <FlamingNarwhal> what a HERO
[0:59:25] <+bladeofSorensen> @KatyParry_FGC Facts. Whats your favorite version of Andy?
[0:59:27] <KatyParry_FGC> dan is not shingo
[0:59:28] <+vaporousTippler> You can argue Dan is three people. He has Yuri's winpose, afterall.
[0:59:28] <am_omega> Fun fact, Shingo held out fighting a Orochi Iori for a while.
[0:59:32] <+RyTYoung> Hey gang!
[0:59:38] <am_omega> Solo too.
[0:59:45] <KatyParry_FGC> dan is ryo & robert with a pathetic personality
[0:59:56] <KatyParry_FGC> @bladeofSorensen 13 Andy is my favorite
[1:00:05] <+vaporousTippler> Shingo's out here collecting teeth.
[1:00:11] <MrJazzbo> remember when shingo fought with a lighter in his sleeves LUL
[1:00:14] <%jetjagger222> i love eiji's 80s manga villain hair
[1:00:27] <KatyParry_FGC> capcom & SNK have a long history of shit talking eachother so some of their characters mock others
[1:00:31] <%generalve> thats a huge ass roster holy shit
[1:00:32] <+bladeofSorensen> The Kyo fanboy putting in work.
[1:00:33] <am_omega> Yeah and it freaked Kyo and his dad out.
[1:00:40] <KatyParry_FGC> Dan mocks Ryo & Robert. Yuri mocks Akuma
[1:00:47] <FlamingNarwhal> ah yeah Polnareff colored Beni
[1:00:58] <%jetjagger222> "he's amazing"

[1:13:40] <artificiallynatural> unfortunately not many people play this
[1:13:54] <@Solidus_113> GoG is a DRM free platform, so you can download whatever without needing a primary program
[1:13:59] <+StooEsq> GoG's good
[1:14:24] <fuji_92> oh
[1:14:35] <%Solidnick18> menitta gonna do it
[1:14:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOU GET THAT ASS MENITTA
[1:14:41] <+TomDanksEGOT> GoG galaxy, their launcher, actually pulls in all your games from every other launcher so you can just use one, and it imports friend lists
[1:14:43] <%Superbro64> is this rollback or nah?
[1:14:46] <@Solidus_113> nope
[1:14:47] <KatyParry_FGC> no
[1:14:50] <artificiallynatural> no rollback

[1:15:00] <+vaporousTippler> I think it's only Garou at this point, right?
[1:15:02] <artificiallynatural> 97 and garou are the ones with rollback if Im not mistaken
[1:15:05] <HorseGum> Garou, SamSho V SP, and KoF 97 have rollback
[1:15:07] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:15:09] <am_omega> This is definitely not rollback
[1:15:10] <+ratearth> Samsho V
[1:15:10] <+vaporousTippler> Wait, 97 does? Holy hell.
[1:15:12] <fuji_92> most 98 team ever
[1:15:16] <hundkain> pretty sure gog also lets you get the plain installer of your games
[1:15:19] <%Superbro64> aah, 97 does
[1:15:23] <KatyParry_FGC> Garou/KOF 97GM/Samsh 5 all have Garoullback
[1:15:23] <+ratearth> 97 is HUGE in China IIRC
