[0:04:12] <kylejefferies> @darth_mama On console yes, the PC version doesn't really support it.

[0:04:58] <Halospaz117> Is audio a bit quiet to anyone else or my ears just busted?
[0:04:58] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> READ THE LORE
[0:05:02] <CursedNobleman> ONI is bungies greatest game LUL
[0:05:02] <+Posh_Cat> Reach was the best send off
[0:05:04] <hassanico2> (I don't know what Marathon is LUL )
[0:05:04] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Halo has a damn good story. Good writers help
[0:05:06] <%Theycallmenerf> GHOSTS OF ONYX NEEDS TO BE A SPIN OFF GAME
[0:05:06] <+Osiris410> The Halo Trilogy holds up well tbh
[0:05:07] <marvel877> It was a Mac RTS game.
[0:05:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> Add then Red vs Blue happened
[0:05:09] <CISphil> Don't tend to drop into streams, but then I saw "Woolie streaming Halo: Combat Evolved" and let out an audible "OH! Reeaaally?"
[0:05:10] <%RioGascar> @solidus_113 You team killing fucktard
[0:05:11] <prince_johnny_> Halo 4 and 5 sucks tho
[0:05:11] <+D00msDayDan> halo was originally going to be a mac RTS
[0:05:12] <$Rumbutt> Originally an RTS
[0:05:13] <%DatAsuna> And an RTS
[0:05:13] <$jake5713> Dreams of Reach...
[0:05:13] <+Kataiser> MCC PC versions of every Halo game are the worst releases of each game. Be ready for some severe audio jank that wasn't in the original game.
[0:05:15] <+TheotherKristian> Woolie should play in OG and V should play in ANNIVERSARY
[0:05:15] <Iccirrus> Ghosts of Onyx is indeed amazing
[0:05:16] <CorgiRiderCorki> V show me your tattoo!! 💕
[0:05:19] <correctedsun117> Chat, plz no spoilers for 2, it had some good twists
[0:05:20] <%r0chelimit> well.... there certainly are things that happen in a sequential order. So I guess there's a story
[0:05:22] <Xiangchang> Some said this day would never come! What are they to say now?
[0:05:22] <%doomerskeletor13> It was meant to be a top down game
[0:05:23] <$JamesCorck> Cheer500 Hey Woolie, been a fan since 2013, and following you from the old channel. You're great, perhaps the closest I have ever seen to an anime character in real life, except better because you're legit! Also I consider the LPs of Spec Ops and KOTOR II to be the best ones you've done of your entire career. Keep up the good work Sir, you're rocking it!
[0:05:23] <Frostilk> ONI sequel never :(

[0:10:49] <+Strelok608> the halo AR actually shoots 7.62 rounds, you just don't notice because the covenant is so strong

[0:11:08] <huskarl_zap> push button to make it look worse
[0:11:08] <+Randrews545> MCC totally has splitscreen
[0:11:09] <%optimasmaximas> mcc does tho
[0:11:11] <+D00msDayDan> they cut splitscreen in halo 5 so it could hit 60fps
[0:11:11] <Drunkengen> 343 Doesnt have friends
[0:11:13] <RoboticRexkek> wait there's splitscreen in MCC
[0:11:13] <+papasmurf531> MCC Xbone has splitscreen, PC doesnt
[0:11:14] <+JoshuaSXM> Can't wait for Paper Mario the Kill Master Chief in the after Credits scene
[0:11:14] <%Hawk_Rush> :( what a waste
[0:11:14] <correctedsun117> @WoolieVersus 5 was BUILT for co-op, to a detriment

[0:11:31] <nothuzad> yeas 1 2 and reach
[0:11:32] <+TheotherKristian> MCC Halo 2 has splitscreen, I can only confirm Halo 2 has splitscreen on XBOXX
[0:11:34] <+OROSONA> I mean, 5 had some other problems too lol
[0:11:35] <+syn_draco> 3 just got one of its flights
[0:11:35] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus they cut split-screen in halo 5 so it can hit 60fps on a xbone
[0:11:36] <CISphil> PC MCC doesn't have splitscreen!? God, what the fuck...
[0:11:36] <%prime_name> Man ODST is the SHIT!
[0:11:36] <donstylo> Woolie wouldn't it make more sense to play Reach first?
[0:11:37] <halfmasks> Yoooooooooo
[0:11:37] <%Will9099> odst soon i think
[0:11:39] <%RioGascar> halo infinite said they’d have split screen
[0:11:40] <+FennecZephyr> 3 is coming rapidly
[0:11:40] <cowardman93> 3 should be next month sometime
[0:11:41] <+SashaStarshine> Halo 3 is in beta on PC
[0:11:41] <dabeaminator> Yoooooo, one of my favorite series' getting some Woolie love! What brought this on?
[0:11:42] <theotrainwreck> 3 is in betas, i was in one of em
[0:11:42] <%PadreHail> Remember when Mario went into space to defeat an alien space cult on a ring planet
[0:11:42] <+Kataiser> Halo 3 is in flighting right now. It's coming very soon.
[0:11:43] <%Skullgod> I got into the 3 testing last weekend, its fine
[0:11:44] <karl_rex> PC doesn't have splitscreen but Xbone does
[0:11:44] <%DatAsuna> wow that sucks
[0:11:44] <+Strelok608> 3 first then odst
[0:11:44] <halfmasks> NOW THIS IS A PLAYTHROUGH
[0:11:46] <DinoBear_7> I hate how blue team showed up in one of the worst campaigns in the series
[0:11:46] <masterfire23> the halo 3 flight is being done right now
[0:11:47] <Crippl3> 3 should be out in a couple weeks
[0:11:47] <cipher758> Hi Woolieo
[0:11:48] <+Posh_Cat> Halo 5 had requisition packs and loadouts - it became CoD and that left a bad taste IMO
[0:11:51] <+Fenrein> Halo 4 was just too different for me. I feel like environment design and the sandbox suffered with them, and the space politics went out the window
[0:11:51] <armchairmaster_> Well V, you also have to take into account that Halo 5 is the worst Halo game in the series.
[0:11:52] <%Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Hi Woolz & V. I hate LoU2 so much. I've never felt so miserable playing a game. I hate the pacing, plot, theme. I want to stop but I need to see this through to the end, be part of the conversation, see how it ends. Ever feel like this? Westworld maybe?
[0:11:53] <xenprecs> Yeah they cut split screen to hit 60fps
[0:11:54] <+Strelok608> Admiral Kizaruuu
[0:11:54] <Griffin1171> OH NO, IT'S MISSING 4
[0:11:55] <+mechslayer71> Reach Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:11:55] <%doomerskeletor13> ODST is coming out soonish
[0:11:57] <+Double_Tap_That> They only had 13 months to finish the MCC, V!
[0:11:57] <turbofolk> Woolie are you going by timeline or by release date?
[0:11:58] <%SuperKirby24> oh man, odst is name i havent heard about in a good while
[0:12:12] <Xiangchang> Halo 3 is in it's Flight stage on PC. It's pretty darn good, so far.
[0:12:12] <%FallenAngelZelos> Lil' V here for another LP?! Let's gooooooooooooooo!

[0:13:28] <MyNameIsRasus> What 4
[0:13:30] <%PadreHail> ROUND 2
[0:13:30] <Crippl3> to be fair, ODST and Reach were prequels
[0:13:31] <prince_johnny_> ODST was good tho
[0:13:31] <CISphil> What is this emote I got? @kazuhira_boat
[0:13:32] <+Druuplays_> Is arbiter even in this game?
[0:13:32] <nothuzad> ODST was a cool spin off that made sense
[0:13:32] <ralphfromdk> At least ODST and Reach were prequils
[0:13:33] <Jaku2011> NEVER STOP THE FIGHT
[0:13:33] <Solidnick18> keith david yeee
[0:13:34] <+GrumbleGrouse> 1-3 are all that matter to me anyway

[0:13:43] <$jake5713> Reach was awesome though.
[0:13:43] <karl_rex> Halo 4 easily had some of the best writing in the series
[0:13:44] <huskarl_zap> I cant believe neo covenant came back again
[0:13:46] <$QueequegTheater> Halo 4 is good, it's 5 that sucks massive ass

[0:13:53] <%Theycallmenerf> Halo ended with Reach, don’t @ me.
[0:13:53] <turbofolk> More pylons
[0:13:55] <correctedsun117> GOTCHA BITCH
[0:13:57] <%doomerskeletor13> ODST and a Reach were great, 4 was fine.
[0:13:57] <@Solidus_113> GOTEM
[0:13:57] <%RioGascar> Bungie wanted to be finished
[0:13:57] <%SomersaultJustice> caught you sleepin

[0:14:04] <Cykron> Expectations Subverted
[0:14:09] <HereComestheChief> Finish the Salty Runback
[0:14:09] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Halo 4 is great. 5 is meh
[0:14:09] <halfmasks> You must construct additional Pylons
[0:14:09] <CorgiRiderCorki> bamboozled
[0:14:11] <+0hKayCeee> Remember Reach
[0:14:12] <donnnnni> Yea baybeeeeee
[0:14:12] <MyNameIsRasus> YOU FOOL! YOU FELL FOR IT
[0:14:12] <%DatAsuna> "something something woolie just likes green man"
[0:14:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @WoolieVersus A HALO 6 Teaser LITEREALLY JUST DROPPED on Twitter
[0:14:13] <+SteveTheSpoon> Halo: The Fall of Reach is a great book. I don't know if it's cannon anymore
[0:14:14] <StarlitStunner> lytTHUMBSUP lytSUP
[0:14:15] <CurrySauseBandit> @theycallmenerf @ing you cause we agree.
[0:14:16] <halfmasks> We were tricked!
[0:14:16] <vulkan_vibes> starcraft warcraft are warhammer rips
[0:14:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Subverted
[0:14:17] <dukenux> Halo. i know what is :)
[0:14:18] <+dioma887> So this is a prank?
[0:14:18] <huskarl_zap> I liked halo
[0:14:18] <correctedsun117> FUCK YEAH
[0:14:19] <%Reco08> Wooliez? Playing Halo? Did I end up in the right timeline?
[0:14:19] <+jiggy_snipe> we gotta with the popular left field with Woolie
[0:14:20] <haitakaa> halo actually scared the fuck out of me as a kid
[0:14:20] <+evbites> i missed that ship i'll jump on
[0:14:21] <thewhiterice92> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
[0:14:23] <Joestar1890> JUST STOP AT REACH, DO NOT PLAY 4
[0:14:23] <cowardman93> I'm absolutely LOVING Woolie picking up the greats
[0:14:23] <+JohnRSoviet> Y'know what? that halo is a good vidyagaem
[0:14:25] <Ultralazuli> So we can expect a Halo theme
[0:14:28] <armchairmaster_> 1-4, Reach and ODST are the only Halo games worth playing, MAYBE Halo Wars but those aren't necessary. Just skip 5, whatever the costs.
[0:14:28] <%emperordread> Woolie ready to go MAINSTREAM
[0:14:28] <+Extrallent> are you guys playing the enhanced graphics or the original. because one of the middle levels looks way better with the original graphics
[0:14:28] <+mechslayer71> @theycallmenerf I’m @-omg you, but to agree with you
[0:14:29] <dabeaminator> Are you gonna be Woolie's Lore-guide?
[0:14:29] <nothuzad> lewdskeletor13 it was ok-ish but kinda unneccessary especialy with throwing the focus on john and cortana :/
[0:14:29] <+Fenrein> Chief in 4 doesn't even feel like the same character. He just suddenly had a personality.
[0:14:30] <penitentpentwitch> Wait, what will Little V's setup be? Hungarian? Mouse and Keyboard?
[0:14:33] <CorgiRiderCorki> remember reach > remember the Alamo
[0:14:34] <CISphil> This "Great Journey" Ba Dum Tis!
[0:14:35] <%Hawk_Rush> yakuza confirmed PogChamo
[0:14:35] <Ynkubus_> play 4 its fine you babies
[0:14:36] <%Maxo_Stream> is this the mf WoolieVersus golden age???
[0:14:36] <+OROSONA> How deep are we goin though
[0:14:36] <%Theycallmenerf> @currysausebandit Pog @ing
[0:14:37] <Jaku2011> I like Halo as well
[0:14:37] <%superc37> FUCK OFF 4 HAS A GOOD STORY
[0:14:39] <%Reco08> But for real, enjoy your day and time with the game Woolz.
[0:14:40] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> you planning on playing the whole trilogy?
[0:14:40] <%doomerskeletor13> John Halo is Doomguys cousin
[0:14:41] <stayinthepocket> Yo the teaser they released today was fucking sick
[0:14:41] <DaBigVitus> the kiefsatz hascherach takes the bong jabbar
[0:14:42] <%PadreHail> Switches to game mode and it's Marathon
[0:14:43] <geassguy360> modded Mass Effect Trilogy is the SHIIIIT
[0:14:44] <%ringabal> *Gazes longingly at Trauma Team poster*
[0:14:45] <%Blazymaniac> same
[0:14:45] <vulkan_vibes> chant the THEME
[0:14:48] <+TheotherKristian> Please consider Gears of War, it's so unwelcoming
[0:14:49] <+Fenrein> The closest thing he had prior were witty one liners
[0:14:51] <squidmax1> NGL, 4 actually is my favorite story.
[0:14:54] <+Strelok608> in this house we do not respect halo 4
[0:14:57] <%DSD24> I feel like Woolie would enjoy playing FEAR
[0:14:58] <+steampunkkiller> @woolieversus you ready to develop a new PTSD from this game?
[0:15:00] <+SteveTheSpoon> Flooded Mines on Foundry was my favourite custom game in H3
[0:15:00] <+OROSONA> Is Woolie picking up the books as well?
[0:15:02] <Cykron> 4 isn't the best, but it's pretty ok
[0:15:02] <dabeaminator> Are you playing the remaster or the original?

[0:15:17] <nothuzad> squidmax1 I think the ideas of 4 are interestingbut the execution - eh
[0:15:17] <%DatAsuna> "Let's rewind"
[0:15:20] <%afronooch> 5 is fineeeer
[0:15:20] <%Gruhunchously> Gotta go back, back to the past.
[0:15:26] <%ChrisBardow> Wtf we doing combat evolved?
[0:15:26] <Jaku2011> PLAY 5 and hate it
[0:15:28] <%vice127> I can't wait to see Woolie play Last of Us 2 in 2025
[0:15:29] <%ChrisBardow> Godlike
[0:15:29] <%shoutofthehobo> Halo woolieFUN
[0:15:35] <geassguy360> No, play 5, form your own damn opinion
[0:15:35] <dukenux> cant believe i say this, but ME, atleast the 1st could use a remaster
[0:15:36] <+IsThisOne> 5s story is trash but it's gameplay is probably the best in the series
[0:15:36] <fuji_92> naaaaaaaaaaaah
[0:15:38] <plankk56> nah Kotor was hype
[0:15:40] <Joestar1890> @superc37 I have a feeling he might because of morbid curiosity
[0:15:42] <haitakaa> SWTOR when
[0:15:42] <+chuckster_ocean> Halos 1-3 Reach and ODST are the series. The rest of the games are weird spinoffs
[0:15:44] <bigbradish> Have one guy in a tanktop and shorts and the other in warmups haha
[0:15:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Halo 5 is honestly the only one I didn’t like, enjoyed all the others
[0:15:47] <Joestar1890> V has come too?
[0:15:47] <marvel877> Show of hands, anyone else used to dick around with glitches, super jumps, and getting out of bounds in Halo 2 multiplayer back then?
[0:15:48] <+Bluemanzee> Kotor 2 was hype
[0:15:55] <Rhinoprotoss> Is Woolie using his abomination setup for Halo?
[0:15:56] <CorgiRiderCorki> v has come to!✓
[0:15:56] <%vextalyst> cheer500 Yes yes and more yes I never saw this coming and I love it. Not done with the Kotor anime yet but It is one of the best LPs of all time and I'm super happy to see V back.

[0:16:31] <+SteveTheSpoon> wort wort wort
[0:16:31] <+Fenrein> Bumper Jumper is great
[0:16:32] <Joestar1890> @haitakaa Never, because neither of them like playing MMORPG
[0:16:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Didact is cool actually
[0:16:33] <squidmax1> Get used to lots of big obtuse words in Halo. They love that shit.
[0:16:33] <VestigeOuroboros> Bumper jumper can suck a chode, boxer master race.
[0:16:37] <dabeaminator> Default was always my favorite
[0:16:39] <nothuzad> rubbishbinge it has a "solo" story to follow through but PSO1 story certainly is more an afterthought around the mechanics and world building :D
[0:16:39] <+Idziman> RECON 4 LIFE
[0:16:41] <+DisasterJensen> i started playing swtor cuz you guys
[0:16:44] <theotrainwreck> CHAD BUMPER JUMP

[0:16:49] <%Gruhunchously> Shoot punch nade
[0:16:49] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Elite controller is godly for this game.
[0:16:50] <derap41> boomer game this is
[0:16:50] <Joestar1890> Bumber Jumper is the best for Titanfall
[0:16:51] <%Theycallmenerf> @fist_wizard_jay AHHHHHHHHEEEHHHHHH
[0:16:51] <Solidnick18> just walk
[0:16:52] <%ChrisBardow> Green thumb
[0:16:55] <+Mr_ZombieFetish> Bumper jumper is great!!
[0:16:59] <BioticEmu> halo didn't have sprint even when sprint was common
[0:16:59] <+Mr_ZombieFetish> or greenthumb too
[0:17:00] <%doomerskeletor13> I still have some Duke controllers in my basement lmao
[0:17:03] <%ChrisBardow> But bumper jumper is the wave tho
[0:17:05] <+Posh_Cat> Classic controls was so gooood
[0:17:05] <+OROSONA> There’s no sprint for a while my guy lol
[0:17:05] <donnnnni> Chad Recon
[0:17:08] <+Kindan55> He using an Xbox controller?
[0:17:08] <+0hKayCeee> halfmasks ever read a story on reddit about a guy who bought a 4k Master Chief suit
[0:17:11] <%DatAsuna> The start is the only time to learn the real shit
[0:17:11] <+TheotherKristian> FOR ME, the Sprint button FUCKS UP bumper jumper for me
[0:17:12] <+babyacid> john halo needs no sprint
[0:17:14] <dabeaminator> Reach was the first to add a sprint
[0:17:21] <%Gruhunchously> The spirit of QA
[0:17:23] <geassguy360> DOOM Eternal needs jump and dash on different buttons for high level play
[0:17:23] <+killatubby> recon for me always
[0:17:25] <%GoogleyGareth> Halo is a good bit slower than doom fyi
[0:17:25] <%noobzoar_two_hands> The Duke is only for those with Giga Chad hands
[0:17:26] <Revawo> Oh be sure to play CE in the OG graphics
[0:17:26] <stayinthepocket> the tryhard bumper jumper vs the Chad default
[0:17:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Wasn’t Sprint an ability in Reach?
[0:17:28] <%Valask> SAID THE MAN WITH CONTROLLER AND MOUSE
[0:17:29] <%Theycallmenerf> Chat, ima be real with you, I only used bumper jumper in Comp Swat
[0:17:32] <Stormiercashew> halo 3 controls are superior
[0:17:33] <+Posh_Cat> who here earned halo 3 recon back in the day?
[0:17:37] <fuji_92> playing as Jonh Halo intended
[0:17:38] <Hellarussian> plug in your GameShark now
[0:17:42] <xenprecs> Yes plz play on classic graphics
[0:17:44] <+Posh_Cat> ellaHEY i got recon
[0:17:44] <+OROSONA> Sprint was a trade off for jet pack and armor
[0:17:46] <+IsThisOne> Sprint was an ability in reach
[0:17:46] <Revawo> anniversary graphics betrays the feel and atmosphere of Combat Evolved's graphics
[0:17:47] <Lancaster_H> "Im a fan of playing as intended" says the man who tried to play HL with a controller LUL

[0:17:50] <%omenzazu> no one expects woolies Halo inquisition
[0:17:51] <+OROSONA> You wont be sprinting until Ike 5
[0:17:52] <%doomerskeletor13> SWAT on Halo Reach gave me hours of fun back in the day
[0:17:54] <+killatubby> stick is crotch and B should melee
[0:17:56] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus V, makes sure that Woolie learns how Chief is literally a 40K Space Marine

[0:17:58] <+felrender> Apologies if you've been asked this already, any chance of a Fallen Order playthru with you and V?

[0:20:52] <StarlitStunner> Ghosts of Onyx!
[0:20:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Fall of Reach is very good

[0:20:54] <%Theycallmenerf> @d00msdaydan PREACH BROTHER
[0:20:55] <%Asuterisuku> Halo, you say? You're slowly turning into a real shooter player, Woolie! With that said... Halo 1 is the only game in the series in which the guns actually feel good.
[0:20:57] <%bread_assassin> Is this just gonna be Halo 1 or are they gonna do the whole trilogy or something?
[0:20:57] <correctedsun117> The FLood, and First Strike
[0:20:58] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Fall of Reach, The Flood, First Strike
[0:20:59] <%tyler274> Fall of reach -> The flood -> First Strike
[0:21:00] <Tucker0603> contact harvest is great
[0:21:00] <+SteveTheSpoon> That one moment in Fall of Reach when John kicks the shit out of those ODST's
[0:21:00] <+Posh_Cat> Halo 1 pistol is a god teir weapon
[0:21:01] <greengregguy> Does Halo Reach make Fall of Reach not canon tho?
[0:21:02] <marvel877> Fall of Reach, The Flood, First Strike.
[0:21:03] <Halospaz117> Fall of Reach is right before Halo 1
[0:21:03] <%RioGascar> Everyone in my elementary school at lunch were reading the halo books
[0:21:04] <petwisk> let's see 0/75 headshots 2.0
[0:21:04] <stayinthepocket> Fall of Reach. The Flood. First Strike.
[0:21:05] <%doomerskeletor13> A lot of the Halo books are fucking excellent
[0:21:05] <%DatAsuna> Bear in mind the games heavily retcon the books
[0:21:05] <%Gruhunchously> A hot minute
[0:21:06] <+Strelok608> bungie never approved of the books and so reach the game plays fast and loose with the events of the book
[0:21:06] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @xenprecs
[0:21:06] <%libra_zero> the Reach game makes some of the stuff in FoR noncanon
[0:21:07] <+dom3800> Fall of Reach is an amazing book
[0:21:08] <vulkan_vibes> fall of reach, the xxxxx, and first strike
[0:21:10] <%superc37> The Flood is probably the best of them
[0:21:11] <+dom3800> The others are okay

[0:26:07] <+Neoepochx> I think back then we just called them "Two-player" games.
[0:26:08] <turbofolk> Oh YEAH
[0:26:08] <%Reco08> @WoolieVersus Tell V that we love him and he's one of the best.
[0:26:08] <Solidnick18> i love 2
[0:26:10] <fuji_92> nah, put wools to play musou Kappa
[0:26:12] <DigitalJoshie> Little V Millz: "their games"
[0:26:12] <%DSD24> I feel like these recommendations are like "Woolie play cool shit!"
[0:26:15] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[0:26:19] <RiverBirch> Yooo!
[0:26:22] <%Asuterisuku> @ArbyDMC The problem with Classic graphics for H1 is that... Well, it's the Gearbox port, and they fucked things up.
[0:26:22] <RiverBirch> V's back for Halo!?
[0:26:22] <%ringabal> "They're games" is the "We'll keep you on file" of streaming.
[0:26:24] <dabeaminator> Halo 2 is the best game in the series
[0:26:24] <ashenjuan25> Mass effect trilogy?
[0:26:24] <rubbishbinge> good ol yaiba
[0:26:24] <%Javaa01> It wasn't quite 14 months, but there was a development reset
[0:26:26] <+TheShisno> Yeah, wild concept
[0:26:26] <$QueequegTheater> Pat on suicide watch
[0:26:27] <ArbyW> Halo 2's development was a shitshow
[0:26:29] <%Reco08> Ninja Gaiden Xbox is the one I enjoy, 2 doesn't really hold up well.
[0:26:29] <+Fenrein> Those docs are fantastic
[0:26:33] <ashenjuan25> Or at least 2
[0:26:35] <Joestar1890> They're good games EXCEPT FOR 5
[0:26:36] <DigitalJoshie> halo1- reach are so good
[0:26:37] <%Reco08> The games are also infinite bull.
[0:26:38] <%RioGascar> Bungie fucked themselves hard on halo 2’s dev
[0:26:39] <+TheShisno> Halo 2 is a miracle
[0:26:39] <huskarl_zap> were popular
[0:26:43] <%doomerskeletor13> Halo 2 is basically DMC 4

[0:28:09] <%krispen_wa> Ever since Woolie declined the threesome
[0:28:10] <Tucker0603> halo legends is fucking rad

[0:31:34] <%Asuterisuku> This is the only game where we actually get to hear the Covenant languages; every other game we hear it filtered through a translator.
[0:31:34] <%queaks> Whats up with the view count?
[0:31:36] <Tucker0603> Mac guns are fucking rad
[0:31:37] <+jetjagger222> is foehammer going to join the SBFP canon's list of heroes

[0:31:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> View count is drunk
[0:31:50] <Nekros4442> Well, CoD had regenerating health
[0:31:50] <%kinetikpaws> 1k to 78 viewers. . seems legit

[0:31:59] <+Skyebaker> halo 2 def was
[0:32:01] <+Skyebaker> not halo 1
[0:32:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> OKAYYYYY
[0:32:02] <Prevot> only holding 2 weapons isnt a good thing tho
[0:32:02] <ThatGuyThere03> regenerating health isn't in until Halo 2
[0:32:02] <%Javaa01> 2 weapon limit was a thing before Halo in a game or two
[0:32:03] <ashenjuan25> Was it my imagination that a grunt’s said, “fuck you.”
[0:32:04] <%superc37> all the halo games hold up really well tbh
[0:32:04] <cowardman93> pretty much every FPS now can trace itself to Halo
[0:32:04] <hassanico2> Only 2 weapons DansGame
[0:32:05] <Torivore> Health doesn't regen, fake fan
[0:32:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah humanities tech doesn’t seem as advanced as it should be by the 2500s
[0:32:08] <Zayasu> twitch view count bugged again
[0:32:08] <shytle> @woolieversus what episode of kotor were you talking about halo ships, i dont remember which one
[0:32:09] <$QueequegTheater> @Nekros4442 Halo 1 predates CoD's regenning health
[0:32:11] <donnnnni> UNSC Frigate = GUN
[0:32:13] <DeathByPoke7> fucking replays in h3
[0:32:14] <%Theycallmenerf> Health PACKS BAY BEE
[0:32:14] <+Bonerlord911> halo 2 had regenerating health, halo 1 has healthpacks
[0:32:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> which one we doing?
[0:32:17] <%a_goth_pancake> only 2 weps sucks.
[0:32:18] <Nekros4442> @QueequegTheater damn really eh?
[0:32:18] <+Extrallent> halo 1 has regenerated shields. not health
[0:32:19] <+ghostfaceninja_> this gonna be a full playthrough?
[0:32:19] <$QueequegTheater> Chief doesn't NEED to roadie run
[0:32:20] <+turolord> let's gooooooo games still so good
[0:32:21] <hassanico2> Is only 2 weapons seriously a fucking point of pride?
[0:32:24] <%JD_Lars> Helped ruin Bioshock Infinite’s gameplay
[0:32:24] <cowardman93> no V please tell me it's not 20
[0:32:26] <%queaks> Ive only read the Halo books and never played the games
[0:32:26] <%PadreHail> Halo 1 is balanced really well
[0:32:27] <%Lightning_Bolt_Action> Lightning_Bolt_Action subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Halo is a pretty cool guy. eh kills aleins and doesnt afraid of anything.Curious to see what weapons you'll main. My bet's on the needler.
[0:32:27] <+paladinstarbuster> WutFace 20 years
[0:32:30] <%Valask> estus should be standard
[0:32:33] <%optimasmaximas> no, fuck off with destiny
[0:32:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> destiny 1 is not worth it
[0:32:36] <CorgiRiderCorki> shield regens, but you have to pick up health packs
[0:32:36] <Jaku2011> What
[0:32:37] <Joestar1890> OMG Halo Combat Evolved is 19 YEARS OLD
[0:32:37] <Dave_VD> It holds up well. The large environments and vehicles are still unmatched

[0:32:42] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:32:43] <%queaks> Destiny is worse halo

[0:32:44] <$QueequegTheater> @Nekros4442 Halo 1 was 2003, CoD 2 was 2005
[0:32:45] <+D00msDayDan> people need to hit the fucking brakes on woolie dipping his toe into halo
[0:32:45] <%raven_frame> There was some weird Pac Man game that had regenerating health I think.
[0:32:45] <karl_rex> Not worth it not one bit
[0:32:45] <ThatGuyThere03> Guardian
[0:32:46] <%brunoberserk> fuck destiny
[0:32:46] <Tucker0603> I like Destiny
[0:32:48] <penitentpentwitch> Too much of time commitment
[0:32:48] <vulkan_vibes> this game is legal
[0:32:48] <%jepupu> Halo ?!
[0:32:49] <%DSD24> Destiny has cool armor
[0:32:49] <%DatAsuna> that wizard came from the moon
[0:32:50] <%BisoromiBear> wizards from the moon
[0:32:50] <+TheShisno> Don't let it set in that it's almost been 20 years
[0:32:52] <derap41> Its not good

[0:32:55] <%Ancopro> the darkness
[0:32:56] <squidmax1> that wizard came from the moon...
[0:32:56] <%doomerskeletor13> This game came out when I was 3 years old
[0:32:57] <Joestar1890> Moon's haunted
[0:32:58] <cowardman93> it's setting in guys
[0:32:59] <%superc37> and halo 1 only has kinda regen health, where the shield regens and you still need health packs for health
[0:33:02] <+syn_draco> The only good story in D1 is after the main story & in the grimoire
[0:33:03] <+TheShisno> Okay but the wizards came from the moon
[0:33:03] <phantalime> destiny lore is incredible who cares about the game
[0:33:05] <dabeaminator> Good art design, bad game
[0:33:05] <%DatAsuna> Shame it never does anything
[0:33:05] <%Asuterisuku> Half-Life 2 when?
[0:33:06] <%DappercatEsquire> Depth by ambiguity, that's Destiny lore
[0:33:06] <+wunp_fxs> theyre ok
[0:33:07] <+Bonerlord911> destiny lore is a fucking rabbit hole dont bother
[0:33:09] <mdkcde> Thanks for the PrideLaugh @roguemerc69
[0:33:09] <+TheShisno> Yeah it's okay
[0:33:13] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Destiny peaked at King's Fall
[0:33:15] <%superc37> ALso ngl destiny is not as good as halo
[0:33:15] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Destiny skyboxes woolieGASM
[0:33:19] <%ringabal> 5/10
[0:33:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> just a heads up, halo 1 combat evolved has some long late game stuff that is just big open areas and annoying hallways with flood
[0:33:20] <liljojofett> Its got its ups and downs
[0:33:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Didn’t they replace Dinklage with Nolan North
[0:33:22] <+SteveTheSpoon> I play so much Destiny 2. Please don't play it woolie. Save yourself.
[0:33:23] <%superc37> in terms of lore and story
[0:33:26] <cowardman93> you hear Pat shitting on it
[0:33:29] <%DatAsuna> You hear a lot of complaining mostly
[0:33:30] <Joestar1890> I like using super powers in Destiny, it's okay after that tho
[0:33:30] <+D4C_Trice> Dinklebot got patched out in the dlc lol
[0:33:31] <CorgiRiderCorki> destiny is barely a game 😒
[0:33:31] <Frostilk> Its a solid 7/10, good and bad
[0:33:32] <%ArthurDayne88> ArthurDayne88 subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:33:34] <Nihilisticdestroyer> destiny is such a disapointment from what bungie came from
[0:33:36] <DigitalJoshie> I played D 1&2, and dropped bith
[0:33:37] <Rhinoprotoss> Most useless Destiny
[0:33:38] <+TheShisno> I played it and I dropped it because Bungie can't plan live service content worth a shit

[1:08:12] <WanderingSwordsman> The change weapon prompt is under your ammo
[1:08:15] <%DSD24> @einherjarvalk I think V said that He is playing on Classic and Woolie is on the remaster graphics
[1:08:16] <%superc37> please reload
[1:08:22] <Saltmeisterr> CRONCH
[1:08:27] <huskarl_zap> press the black button
[1:08:30] <%Tearonex> I don't even think Woolie even sees the swap weapon prompt
[1:08:33] <%DSD24> Reload after every kill
[1:08:38] <%MayorRev> big crunch
[1:08:42] <%subjectg> Pretty sure they’ll be fine on heroic with V here
[1:08:44] <Xiangchang> Oh yeah. If you melee Elites in classic graphics, the framerate drastically lowers from the amount of blood.
[1:08:55] <%fist_wizard_jay> SCHMEATY WHACK
[1:08:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:08:58] <DeathByPoke7> almost got stuck
[1:08:59] <%Asuterisuku> I thought that stuck Woolie for a moment.
[1:09:00] <Halospaz117> I thought for sure he got stuck there
[1:09:00] <+D00msDayDan> DOWN IN FRONT
[1:09:00] <Prevot> sliiiiide
[1:09:02] <%dinnydanny777> Nice kill
[1:09:03] <correctedsun117> Sick drift
[1:09:04] <Shisno27> did he just get stuck for only half health? I've never played on normal
[1:09:05] <Knight_Lautrec> man that melee is satisfying
[1:09:08] <%Areus> ravage2ballz
[1:09:08] <+turolord> man I'm so happy he playing this but oof his fps skills

[1:09:15] <hattrick61> God i love the whack sound
[1:09:16] <%SUTTONSOMEGA> Areus ravage2ballz
[1:09:25] <Naho_Saenoki> @Shisno27 He didn't get stuck, got hit by splash.
[1:09:25] <%dinnydanny777> You can jump that
[1:09:27] <derap41> The UI is really tiny
[1:09:29] <theotrainwreck> @blaggablag Gout, dont make fun
[1:09:31] <%RioGascar> I do not remember the games music being this...prominent
[1:09:32] <phatmac16> Hunter music
[1:09:35] <%AceNugget> lmao I'm here for the magazine being at like 2 everytime woolie swaps weapons
[1:09:38] <+ClericOfSparda> I love the frag grenades
[1:09:49] <%RioGascar> mcc must have mixed the music louder for new graphics
[1:09:52] <%PadreHail> NOLAN NORTH SCREEEEAM
[1:09:54] <Shisno27> alright cause it REALLY looked like it went through him but I guess it missed
[1:09:55] <%Asuterisuku> End of Mission.
[1:09:56] <cowardman93> woolie do not worry about ammo you will have so much as the game goes on
[1:09:58] <%Gruhunchously> Lifeboats, not escape pods

[1:10:33] <%dinnydanny777> Oh No
[1:10:34] <Rhinoprotoss> Legendary hero John Halo wanders around the war zone

[1:11:21] <%RadicalWeegee> that was a game changer

[1:11:27] <%dinnydanny777> John Haloman always sprints
[1:11:29] <CurrySauseBandit> I feel like Woolie should be the one playing on Classic mode. See the original art design and all.

[1:11:36] <+TheShisno> Oh damn shit... them
[1:11:37] <Cykron> Only the best part of Halo ODST
[1:11:39] <HyperBomb21> Sprint ruined Halo because they made the MP maps way too big to compensate for Sprinting

[1:12:51] <cowardman93> 10 years update is crazy
[1:12:52] <%subjectg> @dinnydanny777 it happens to all of us sometimes
[1:12:54] <%dinnydanny777> I prefer the old version tbh
[1:12:55] <ArbyW> LOOK UP
[1:12:55] <ThatGuyThere03> it's not nostalgia
[1:13:00] <+xBolts4Lifex> Old Halo is best Halo
[1:13:00] <%Pinkiefan> Favorite level in all the games right here.
[1:13:00] <prince_johnny_> Samee

[1:13:01] <%a_goth_pancake> r i n g
[1:13:02] <%dinnydanny777> The old version looks nicer to me
[1:13:03] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Maaaaan I remember seeing this for the first time back in 01
[1:13:03] <ArbyW> YEESSSS
[1:13:03] <+Fenrein> HE DID THE THING
[1:13:03] <%Javaa01> The original is a lot nicer in AE
[1:13:05] <+BlackSunEmperor> i def prefer the classic look
[1:13:05] <Kirbachev> Same, really.
[1:13:05] <+ghostfaceninja_> I'm so torn, NOSTALGIA or PURTY??? NotLikeThis
[1:13:05] <%AceNugget> U patted that marine on the shoulder when he told you he didn't want to die
[1:13:05] <+MidnightBurst12> same
[1:13:07] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @How2BEpic
[1:13:11] <RunningNGunning> Old has a better artstyle over imo
[1:13:14] <$agoaj> Bungie knows their skyboxes
[1:13:15] <Kirbachev> The classic was a masterclass in art design.
[1:13:16] <+MidnightBurst12> gives better sense of scale
[1:13:19] <+ChaosEmralds> old has a better style
[1:13:20] <%quinnage7> @woolieversus The new version has fantastic sky boxes
[1:13:21] <%Javaa01> The visual remaster for Halo 2 is way better
[1:13:22] <andrei11dr> Everyone got fucked because they don't got cool armour
[1:13:22] <%Gruhunchously> It's a bit less geometrical
[1:13:22] <+shapeforn> New look is also good
[1:13:24] <+Kqha4000> The remastered graphics are not faithful to the old artstyle
[1:13:26] <Raztron> V is correct, you cant beat a consistent and good art direction
[1:13:33] <+How2BEpic> Woolie needs to know about the trees on new graphics.
[1:13:37] <%a_goth_pancake> Halo's in the mist

[1:15:28] <%ozzrabbit> “I’m a gay robot.”

[1:15:31] <PlasticJake> "hide behind that rock, and then SHOOT 'EM IN THE BACK. just like John Wayne woulda done"
[1:15:31] <%MayorRev> "wait that's illegal"
[1:15:32] <+MeMillionthDollar> 'Why are there six pedals and only four directions?'
[1:15:33] <StarlitStunner> “Its a sword, What’s so hard about swish swish stab?”
[1:15:33] <SixthSun2> Poppin' gamer
[1:15:35] <floralkami> I forget, but it's the one about the sticky grande
[1:15:37] <nicversus> "Call my Double O Donut" "You mean like Doonut?"
[1:15:37] <OverlordLuna> "This weapon is your life"
[1:15:37] <EDFscout> Needler!
[1:15:39] <Sora9567> "Could you put that in a memo and entitle it SHIT I ALREADY KNOW!?"
[1:15:42] <%mitchteck> Do you ever wonder why we’re here
[1:15:42] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Nomad_Scholar
[1:15:43] <CalderGaming> "I have THIRTY-SEVEN zombie plans!"
[1:15:44] <+cursedwithadhd> I said "Shotgun". SHOTGUN DAMMIT!
[1:15:44] <%black_pariah> "wheres the alien? Last time i saw him he was halfway up your ass!"
[1:15:44] <floralkami> the sticky grenade
[1:15:45] <Mike_Mc> do the pistol 1 shot on hunters when you see them
[1:15:46] <karl_rex> "Theres no I in team Grif" Well theres no U in team either so if I'm not on the team and you're not on the team. NOBODY'S on the goddamn team. The team sucks"

[1:15:52] <Tuna_Can_0> infinite ammo tho
[1:15:52] <+wunp_fxs> I massively prefer the banshee look in og halo
[1:15:53] <KongrawDarts> i and out like well lubricated lightning
[1:15:54] <%alpacasintophats> enjoy your proto aim assist
[1:15:54] <%a_goth_pancake> "Dr. Sarge says take two barrels of this shotgun and call me when you're dead. ring ring, hello is that you? yep, you're dead."
[1:15:55] <$QueequegTheater> The Halo 1 pistol is maybe the most absurdly overpowered handgun ever
[1:15:55] <AppleBerryKitty> why are shotguns in all other halos so...bad
[1:15:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:15:57] <penitentpentwitch> Depends on how much the developer values precision
[1:15:57] <thetrashman_sc> halo 1 magnum is too strong i love it
[1:15:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> "I've got a boner for murder"
[1:15:58] <Griffin1171> And I... am a motherfucking ghost
[1:15:59] <+TheShisno> Because last second programming
[1:16:00] <%Asuterisuku> The pistol one-shots a CERTAIN DIFFICULT ENEMY that you encounter a lot later on.
[1:16:01] <akman14> ME1 pistols are the best
[1:16:05] <VestigeOuroboros> Wait until halo 2 when the pistol becomes a trashcan.
[1:16:05] <superc37> overnerfs.
[1:16:07] <Naho_Saenoki> "HDDVDs were replaced by HHDDVVDDVBs."
[1:16:08] <KityLinn> woolie with maximum awareness
[1:16:09] <mesamus> its why they brought back THIS pistol on halo 5
[1:16:09] <%RioGascar> “This doesnt seem physically possible”
[1:16:10] <%omenzazu> Smart pistol in Titanfall
[1:16:11] <%subjectg> “This doesn’t seem physically possible!”
[1:16:13] <%Javaa01> You can totally use Banshees in this campaign
[1:16:14] <unclekulikov> AR is good for this
[1:16:15] <andrei11dr> Dead Space has the best starting pistol
[1:16:16] <pizza_oven3000> they cant see my i cent see them
[1:16:17] <+mckraven> The pistol is so good bungie had to nerf it into thee ground and id never made it back
[1:16:18] <%fist_wizard_jay> POGnum
[1:16:19] <%Javaa01> But you can't hijack

[1:16:32] <%Asuterisuku> Pop.
[1:16:32] <@Menitta> I always liked how enemies used vehicles in Halo
[1:16:33] <%alpacasintophats> you can't fly the banshees in this mission. and you can't hijack either until next game
[1:16:33] <%Gruhunchously> "That was the worst throw ever. Of all time"
[1:16:42] <+evbites> go buy headlight fluid
[1:16:42] <rubbishbinge> don't hurt the banshees :(
[1:16:50] <%superc37> not red just means its out of the most effective range.
[1:16:52] <+TheShisno> And Halo Reach added the bullshit achievement to hijack a banshee in the biggest set of levels
[1:16:54] <KongrawDarts> "TAKE THAT YOU DIRTY WHORE"
[1:16:54] <floralkami> @gruhunchously that was the quote!

[1:19:06] <iamtheTwitchghost> oh shit, halo??? PogChamp
[1:19:06] <Flare3500> oh I thought it was a bug , you can just switch to classic graphics
[1:19:07] <%DSD24> Classic still looks good
[1:19:09] <+TheShisno> They de-squared him
[1:19:09] <$QueequegTheater> JACKALS YE
[1:19:12] <%a_goth_pancake> IT'S FINE THO HE SURVIVED IT'S CANON
[1:19:15] <+ghostfaceninja_> Jackals
[1:19:16] <%Asuterisuku> Super annoying that it knocks you out of scope.
[1:19:16] <%RioGascar> I love how the pilots have the pistol
[1:19:16] <+cursedwithadhd> is it not brightly colored or not green shoot it
[1:19:18] <+How2BEpic> Leap before you think
[1:19:20] <Shisno27> fall damage is the new enemy
[1:19:24] <%PadreHail> DON'T SHOOT HE'S NOT BLACK
[1:19:34] <marvel877> Fall damage. My old enemy.

[1:19:41] <%MrMoonGoose> LITTLE V!
[1:19:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Me and my friend would always try to keep all the marines alive throughout the level and give them names and stuff
[1:19:42] <%dinnydanny777> You can scope in mid air
[1:19:45] <kingofgames726> I love this woolie an little v collab so much
[1:19:46] <SainEdge> Fun DansGame
[1:19:49] <+ghostfaceninja_> Jackals in Legendary....
[1:19:51] <%dinnydanny777> The scope works in midair
[1:19:52] <%raven_frame> If you crouch as you touch the ground it negates the fall damage.
[1:19:55] <%alpacasintophats> also depends if you've reloaded or not
[1:20:00] <@Solidus_113> remember to reload at all times
[1:20:02] <VestigeOuroboros> This might end up being my favorite LP in years.
[1:20:05] <%Lizard0TM> woolie, you can shoot from any range
[1:20:06] <StarlitStunner> Explodey Pink Needles of Death

[1:20:38] <%raven_frame> Woolie should swap the AR for something.

[1:20:43] <%Asuterisuku> One of the few Covenant guns that can be reloaded!
[1:20:43] <%memequisition> needler was my fav
[1:20:45] <faeron93> And there's the other best weapon in the game
[1:20:45] <%dinnydanny777> Needler auto homes
[1:20:50] <Nomad_Scholar> You wouldn't be much of a super soldier if recoil affected you too much
[1:20:51] <%DSD24> Dual Needlers are the best in Halo 2
[1:20:53] <%PadreHail> Needler reloads
[1:20:58] <%Gruhunchously> It's the bee gun from half life
[1:21:02] <%a_goth_pancake> Kreygasm Kreygasm that sfx Kreygasm
[1:21:04] <StarlitStunner> The Needler melee is so satisfying

[1:22:49] <cowardman93> Woolie is out
[1:22:49] <%a_goth_pancake> fear the pink mist

[1:23:21] <Solidnick18> Kreygasm

[1:36:04] <%RioGascar> again halo has some of the best weapons in video games with diverse sounds, mechanics, and feel
[1:36:05] <Sauceboss15> @alrobot2014 oh shit co op
[1:36:06] <Naho_Saenoki> @Solidnick18 It doesn't reflect; it actually shows what you'd see looking through it.
[1:36:07] <DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus What do you think of the new Apex Legends update?
[1:36:09] <%PadreHail> NO SCOPE
[1:36:10] <DigitalJoshie> I remember prerelease footage of the HaloAE they used alot of reach designs
[1:36:10] <skullnaught> hell yeah
[1:36:15] <Snowfellow> Is he playing with a mouse or nah
[1:36:18] <%Asuterisuku> Grunts are weak enough to one-shot even without the headshot.
[1:36:19] <+Dragoneye77> Canadian aim
[1:36:22] <hattrick61> Do a 360
[1:36:23] <cowardman93> firing a gun is so damn satisfying
[1:36:26] <%Asuterisuku> @Snowfellow Controller.
[1:36:26] <Solidnick18> @Naho_Saenoki oh that's pretty neat
[1:36:28] <DigitalJoshie> like chief was just a halo reach armor set
[1:36:28] <BioticEmu> shoot the shell
[1:36:29] <+meatgeneral69> give woolie your energy

[1:36:46] <Shisno27> pistol HWHIP
[1:36:48] <Kirbachev> I love the plasma pistol melee. It's just a left straight.
[1:36:48] <%dinnydanny777> Magnum melee is guntwirling goodness
[1:36:53] <+Double_Tap_That> Forgot how slow the shield regen was.
[1:36:54] <%brachydios777> Wort Wort Wort
[1:36:56] <%xyxlzyzm> cyprus tree > plasma
[1:36:57] <+ghostfaceninja_> ill say it one last time, this difficulty is too easy for co op
[1:36:59] <%raven_frame> Wait until Woolie gets bladed weapons.

[1:37:14] <+gerahwar> Achievement!
[1:37:16] <%DappercatEsquire> Is there no ragdoll in Halo CE?
[1:37:21] <%stemlo_> Shoot the Jackals in the hands
[1:37:26] <CalderGaming> shoot that notch
[1:37:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> are we going to watch Haloid after this?
[1:37:29] <+Metatermin8r> Never did I think I'd see the day when Woolie would stream my favorite video game franchise. What the fuck timeline is this even.....
[1:37:29] <Griffin1171> No, it's a prebaked animation
[1:37:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> he's making it work though!
[1:37:30] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Bread and Butter Kappa
[1:37:30] <JetpackMcQuack> nice shootin tex
[1:37:30] <+Mkingston> "Pop him in the face. It's really satisfying"
[1:37:31] <%Asuterisuku> He's been nailing those headshots though.
[1:37:38] <ashenjuan25> Little v emotes when?
[1:37:38] <ralphfromdk> You just have to hit them in the tiny cutouts on the side
[1:37:39] <%DSD24> Oh man I remember Haloid
[1:37:44] <Flare3500> What happens if V dies can he get revived ?
[1:37:51] <psimon_> floaty jumps, 2 weapon loadout, most generic character design (masterchief). didnt understood the hype back then, don't understand the hype now
[1:37:56] <%RioGascar> You respawn
[1:37:56] <$QueequegTheater> @Flare3500 yes
[1:37:59] <Jolly_Adventurer> @Flare3500 He just respawns
[1:38:00] <+D00msDayDan> @Flare3500 he'll respawn on woolie if he's not being shot at
[1:38:01] <Shisno27> you wouldn't ragdoll you hit ground and then spin into a very particular laying position
[1:38:06] <%dinnydanny777> That was a really good line read because she made it sound like she had just saw them
[1:38:07] <Naho_Saenoki> @Flare3500 Co-op partners get revived when there are no enemies nearby the surviving player,.
[1:38:09] <Fullmetal_Jedi> Lifeboats in my area? It's more likely than you think.
[1:38:09] <Solidnick18> yeee
[1:38:10] <Djinnazz> @Flare3500 checkpoint it.

[1:38:37] <%christopherwpoindexter> @psimon_ i kinda vibe tbh, especially the story. but maybe 2 and 3 are more intensive and emotional in the plot, who knows
[1:38:38] <blaggablag> c h e r i s h t h e j o h n s o n
[1:38:39] <rubbishbinge> You, your boys, and your Johnson

[1:38:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> Let's go to tilted towers PogChamp
[1:38:48] <+ghostfaceninja_> @psimon_, if Halo would've come out on PC, it wouldn't be as big a thing
[1:38:49] <Shisno27> you, your friends, and your johnson
[1:38:50] <%alpacasintophats> if he dies YOU die kinda deal
[1:38:52] <+krabsan> The Spanish voice actor for Johnson is fucking hilarious

[1:39:00] <%dinnydanny777> Tell Woolie how to drift
[1:39:02] <+SashaStarshine> Vehicle controls make a lot more sense for the Covie vehicles
[1:39:03] <scallycap> very weird controls that nobody else used
[1:39:05] <ashenjuan25> Johnson and Johnson?
[1:39:06] <$QueequegTheater> F

[1:39:17] <+ManOfReason> DO A FLIp
[1:39:19] <+gerahwar> One can say, its a stick shiift
[1:39:19] <%christopherwpoindexter> BTW, I've only played the story of CE, no other Halo game yet, here's to hoping I don't see spoilers accidentally
[1:39:20] <Tuna_Can_0> who let this man drive
[1:39:21] <Fullmetal_Jedi> nice~
[1:39:21] <+SoeSpooky> is this just regular halo?
[1:39:23] <%dinnydanny777> Johnson could have died there
[1:39:26] <%Javaa01> Driver's license: Revoked
[1:39:27] <scallycap> im still flipping warthogs and ive been playing for 20 years
[1:39:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> HE DID A FLIP. CLIP IT AND SHIP IT
[1:39:29] <floralkami> please get some health cause that heart beat is making me health conscience...
[1:39:32] <$QueequegTheater> @soespookyboi MCC
[1:39:37] <bleugh> cod blops blackout had halo controls for cars
[1:39:37] <Sauceboss15> AWH YEAH
[1:39:38] <%dinnydanny777> OOOOH YEAH
[1:39:39] <Bigyanno> What difficulty is he playing on?
[1:39:43] <hkgamingtv> warthog in halo1 is indestructible
[1:39:45] <+Metatermin8r> Man OG Warthog physics was wack
[1:39:46] <+Shady_Zaku> Calling it now, Woolie is so gonna kill Johnson
[1:39:46] <%brachydios777> Normal
[1:39:46] <floralkami> normal
[1:39:47] <Halospaz117> Normal
[1:39:49] <+SashaStarshine> Normal
[1:39:50] <Sora9567> LIKE A GLOVE.
[1:39:52] <Bigyanno> ooft
[1:39:54] <+gerahwar> nice parking
[1:39:55] <+mckraven> The warthog is invincible You however are not
[1:39:57] <+ghostfaceninja_> fyi guys, Halo 2 is out on the MCC
[1:39:57] <%Asuterisuku> That turret placement is "normal."
[1:40:14] <%brachydios777> What the?-Sgt Johnson
[1:40:16] <blaggablag> Get that johnson going
[1:40:17] <Bigyanno> I have legit never played CE on less than heroic
[1:40:18] <%Asuterisuku> 3 is currently in beta testing, too.
[1:40:20] <scallycap> trading the sniper for the needler is a choice
[1:40:20] <%dinnydanny777> Most of the guns are fun tbh
[1:40:21] <penitentpentwitch> Did he just drop the pistol for the needler?
[1:40:22] <%christopherwpoindexter> also shout-out to Half-Life 2's dune buggy section stealing the "flip over" gameplay loop from this game 😆
[1:40:23] <+SashaStarshine> @mckraven You're thinking of Halo 3 Warthog. It is very destructable in CE
[1:40:26] <+Grayhammatter> get in the turret johnson!
[1:40:28] <+krabsan> Dual wielding needlers in Halo 2 monkaS
[1:40:35] <Fullmetal_Jedi> I like the melee animation on the Needler
[1:40:39] <%zajoestar> build to climax
[1:40:42] <%Asuterisuku> Dual weilding was awful, don't bring it back.
[1:40:46] <%dinnydanny777> The explosion is so satisfying
[1:40:47] <+Druuplays_> @bigyanno haha what you don’t like a walk through the park LUL
[1:40:48] <StarlitStunner> Needle Stab melee
[1:40:50] <+Metatermin8r> Given its current state in the Flights, Halo 3 should be out soon. Probably in the next couple of weeks.
[1:40:54] <+SashaStarshine> Dual Wielding messed up the balance for like
[1:40:58] <+SashaStarshine> half of the covie armory
[1:41:01] <%brachydios777> Needlers in Halo 1 are pretty good for elites
[1:41:03] <Sauceboss15> NEEDLER OP
[1:41:07] <scallycap> needld
[1:41:07] <+How2BEpic> he blew up quick
[1:41:10] <DeathByPoke7> we need triple wielding
[1:41:11] <blackkanye> I like the sheathe sound effect on needler melee
[1:41:13] <%RioGascar> @christopherwpoindexter but you do have to use the gravity gun to do it. Gordon isnt a power house strong man
[1:41:16] <$QueequegTheater> Needler is the Elite killer
[1:41:16] <%DSD24> "I'm far from fucking ok"
[1:41:17] <+GrumbleGrouse> dual needles is just insane in 2
[1:41:17] <+How2BEpic> That was like 5 shots haha
[1:41:19] <%superc37> @sashastarshine no halo 1 hog is indestructible. the ghost is the only vehicle that can be destroyed
[1:41:22] <blaggablag> a fistfull of needler
[1:41:24] <+SoeSpooky> I hope he plays modded halo after this LUL
[1:41:28] <%superc37> banshee*
[1:41:31] <+SashaStarshine> @DeathByPoke7 Give gursed halo a try LUL
[1:41:34] <%Asuterisuku> Nice nade.
[1:41:48] <+SashaStarshine> @superc37 Oh right i was thinking of Halo 2, mbmb
[1:41:51] <%raven_frame> Woolie's playing well, I hope his confidence in this increases.
[1:41:55] <hattrick61> needler go click
[1:41:57] <%subjectg> @soespookyboi get them rng grenades, and that BTC
[1:42:07] <%christopherwpoindexter> @riogascar true @bigyanno I did it to warm up AND get Normal completion badges (I don't think you can carry them down by completing higher difficulties to get those badges, at least in original Xbox version, unfortunately)
[1:42:08] <%dinnydanny777> You should see how many enemies you can run over
[1:42:09] <thesaltiestscrublord> 2nd best gun
[1:42:12] <%Asuterisuku> I thought he could've handled Heroic, but it's too late now.
[1:42:13] <blackkanye> SHUCKES
[1:42:15] <%Pinkiefan> This level on legendary with no deaths is my favorite challenge in the series.
[1:42:26] <hkgamingtv> play the whole collection but rotate in different games in between
[1:42:27] <+gerahwar> Listen to digital waifu
[1:42:28] <Sauceboss15> I love that woolie is going through an FPS single player phase rn

[1:42:56] <+SoeSpooky> *thanos
[1:42:57] <%dinnydanny777> Fall damage is worth it for big jumps
[1:43:07] <$QueequegTheater> Oh no, his one weakness
[1:43:08] <DigitalJoshie> is cortana a waifu?
[1:43:08] <Flare3500> Just skyrim it and jump

[1:43:28] <%christopherwpoindexter> cortana is kinda hot tbh, but I haven't played anything other than CE's story so I may be proven wrong in a future game if something goes wrong with her, i actually wouldnt know
[1:43:32] <hkgamingtv> cortana is john 117's waifu
[1:43:34] <%dinnydanny777> Cortana is a Waifu you plug into your body
[1:43:40] <+Grizzytron> Johnson's cool guy armor is invisible
[1:43:44] <Spirit_NB> Well, that guy's getting left behind :(

[1:43:46] <%christopherwpoindexter> @dinnydanny777 Kappa
[1:43:47] <+Metatermin8r> Halo 4 Cortana is best Cortana visually.
[1:43:57] <+ManOfReason> LUL
[1:43:57] <+SashaStarshine> Cortana is just a desktop stripper John Halo is very proud of

[1:45:38] <lwpabloelenano2hc> is this the cursed mod?
[1:45:43] <%raven_frame> No.
[1:45:45] <andrei11dr> They should've given out Mafia branded cocaine LUL

[1:45:52] <ashenjuan25> How about a legit glock for gta?
[1:45:55] <blaggablag> @dinnydanny777 anything can be a batarang if you're brave enough
[1:45:59] <%dinnydanny777> If Johnson dies this LP is not canon
[1:46:05] <$QueequegTheater> He knows what the ladies like
[1:46:05] <KingVantq> so is woolie doing a full series playthrough?
[1:46:07] <%chaoticknuckles0> Remember Infamous Second Son condom
[1:46:11] <%kingdovachief> kingdovachief subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Yooo woolie is playing halo, this must be a dream
[1:46:16] <DigitalJoshie> true end is still intact
[1:46:17] <Sauceboss15> IT FUCKS WITH THE CANON THO
[1:46:17] <%superc37> @lwpabloelenano2hc yes, woolie would totally play a fucked up version of the game for his first playthrough.
[1:46:19] <%christopherwpoindexter> @floralkami oh thank u, I guess I was out of the loop. yeah i saw it, thx woolieOMG
[1:46:21] <%DSD24> Damn that grunt died so hard

[1:46:23] <DeathByPoke7> plot armor
[1:46:24] <floralkami> @gigas_trains what?
[1:46:24] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:46:26] <Halospaz117> He has Kenny powers
[1:46:26] <penitentpentwitch> Johnson has been hording those 1-Ups
[1:46:28] <megatronsdong96> or the dead island booby statue
[1:46:29] <$QueequegTheater> "I was only pretending to fall down that chasm"
[1:46:31] <%SuperKirby24> so he's kenny Kappa
[1:46:32] <%dinnydanny777> If Johnson dies this LP is not canon
[1:46:33] <Bigyanno> He's a Spartan 1. And Spartans never die
[1:46:33] <%DappercatEsquire> Important enough to have immortality, not important enough to have a name
[1:46:34] <+Druzem> johnson wasn't named in H:CE?
[1:46:39] <%raven_frame> No.
[1:46:42] <%brachydios777> He was used for advertising
[1:46:45] <kukstorm> I love maaster chef cause he shoot the alieen and he doesn't afraid of anything
[1:46:47] <%doomerskeletor13> Johnson is immortal
[1:46:54] <%christopherwpoindexter> @dinnydanny777 pressure applied
[1:46:58] <+Metatermin8r> Johnson is 100% a named character by this point, his name is specifically used in a later level as well
[1:46:59] <%a_goth_pancake> rip Johnson woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:47:00] <DigitalJoshie> Johnson is like: "RESURRECTION"
[1:47:00] <+gerahwar> Johnson is a forerunner
[1:47:01] <%raven_frame> He was one of the rotating marine NPCs.
[1:47:03] <+CptnCampy61> Johnson canonically immortal
[1:47:05] <andrei11dr> Johnson is the Sion of this universe
[1:47:08] <+ghostfaceninja_> @superc37, you'd have him play the xbox version?
[1:47:16] <+Kindan55> Don't they just handwave him surviving this game in 2?
[1:47:18] <%a_goth_pancake> he's got plasma damaged nerves and shit
[1:47:25] <Mr_Taters > @Zerocool4221 He is named in the credits but he's never called Johnson in game, was definitely not intended to be a main character at this point
[1:47:29] <%GoogleyGareth> SourPls
[1:47:29] <%Lightwolfe> cOLD
[1:47:32] <%doomerskeletor13> They super handwave it in 2
[1:47:32] <Ransom73> BibleThump
[1:47:33] <+theaceclaw> johnson is an ex-spartan
[1:47:42] <%dinnydanny777> Basically dodge the 7th needle
[1:47:42] <%raven_frame> Next mission is going to be hype.
[1:47:49] <+mckraven> @Kindan55 they ask him how he survived and he just says it's classified
[1:47:49] <%superc37> ex spartan *one*
[1:47:51] <%RioGascar> oh boy
[1:47:55] <StarlitStunner> A first gen Spartan
[1:47:59] <+SoeSpooky> was it beating the entire game on legendary to get the ending with Johnson?
[1:47:59] <%superc37> not spartan 2
[1:48:00] <$QueequegTheater> Spartan-I, not an ex-Spartan
[1:48:01] <%DappercatEsquire> Can you cancel the pistol charge in this game by swapping weapons?
[1:48:03] <+Metatermin8r> @Kindan55 No, its explained as "Johnson is just that good" in the Graphic Novel.
[1:48:05] <%dinnydanny777> Satisfying
[1:48:10] <VestigeOuroboros> Plasma pistol best flashlight.
[1:48:11] <%a_goth_pancake> rip Harvest :(
[1:48:13] <%brachydios777> @theaceclaw Chief is a spartan 2 Johnson is a spartan 1
[1:48:17] <Solidnick18> also good flashlight
[1:48:18] <%Chatterbox1991> wait what
[1:48:19] <+gerahwar> The Halo soundtrack is pure sex music, and its amazing!
[1:48:20] <%RioGascar> Time for the mission that had me go “yo this game is cool” grantef it was like my 3rd or 4th video game
[1:48:21] <+SashaStarshine> @QueequegTheater Yes
[1:48:22] <+Druzem> that's wild. I feel like I've never not known his name
[1:48:22] <%christopherwpoindexter> oh that's what that is. i love that these remastered blood splatters look dark and realistic, not kool aid like classic woolieLORE woolieSHOOK
[1:48:23] <ralphfromdk> Might word that different. It still uses ammo when he shoots, just doesn't burn ammo while holding the charge
[1:48:24] <+How2BEpic> Carpal Tunnel, The Gun.
[1:48:26] <floralkami> @theaceclaw what? how? Spartans are genetically modified, almost breed to be solders
[1:48:28] <%dinnydanny777> You can also spam single shots
[1:48:35] <+Stratusfi> god i forgot how good the names for the ships in this game are
[1:48:36] <stormhawk9891> That ship name is so good
[1:48:36] <Louie_Salmon> Some big "Hollow realization" energy from the ship names
[1:48:37] <+Kindan55> The power of plot armour LUL
[1:48:38] <+SashaStarshine> Isn't Johnson a Spartan 1?
[1:48:45] <Louie_Salmon> They're basically Touhou game titles
[1:48:47] <+Metatermin8r> He is
[1:48:47] <%Chatterbox1991> Truth and Reconciliation? that's weirdly specific
[1:48:47] <+A0N33> Has V told Woolie about the backpack reload?
[1:48:49] <fischdead> woolie get a third player
[1:48:51] <%christopherwpoindexter> I love that, like the Half-Life games, this one has some minimal usage of music
[1:48:58] <megatronsdong96> love the image of master chief running around struggling to control this vibrating pistol
[1:48:59] <+Druzem> has woolie never played halo?
[1:48:59] <$QueequegTheater> @fischdead why
[1:49:04] <Spirit_NB> Spartan 1s are kinda like cybernetic implants? something like that
[1:49:06] <sniffy77> Johnson is part of the Orion project, which basically is spartan 1
[1:49:14] <slatersev> Johnson is a Spartan 1 yes
[1:49:16] <+ghostfaceninja_> plasma pistol + magnum... never seen that combo before Kappa
[1:49:17] <%dinnydanny777> Get good at Plasma Charging
[1:49:17] <@Commando_Joe> @Zerocool4221 blind playthrough
[1:49:17] <+MaddyCaddy> Johnson is really cool
[1:49:17] <blaggablag> he's over there, holding his johnson
[1:49:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Johnson was part of the Orion project which were Spartan 1s
[1:49:18] <%brachydios777> Spartan 2s are kidnapped at child hood to br trained as soldiers
[1:49:18] <Halospaz117> Johnson will just run
[1:49:27] <sniffy77> Spartan 1 is bioaugments, but nowhere near on the scale of Spartan II
[1:49:27] <slatersev> Foehammer
[1:49:28] <Halospaz117> God I love the Pelican design
[1:49:29] <+valentinostand> I'll be back at halo 2 and onward halo 1 is nice but now what the series becomes
[1:49:31] <%emeraldskrull> what the hell
[1:49:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Pelican is choppy lol
[1:49:36] <floralkami> that's DUMB. the gun is already shit as it is
[1:49:36] <%superc37> woolie you should REALLY make a habit of paying attention to your ammo counter
[1:49:36] <%subjectg> @louie_salmon subterranean animism is a good covie ship mame

[1:50:38] <%stemlo_> The best Halo ship name is 100% "In Amber Clad"
[1:50:38] <%optimasmaximas> @Bonerlord911 dude youre gonna get yourself banned brownW
[1:50:39] <fischdead> time for stealth woolie;/

[1:50:40] <%TomFrancis_> that looks like a completely different planet
[1:50:40] <+gerahwar> BIG OOF how did our eyes adjust in 2001????
[1:50:42] <iamtheTwitchghost> i prefer the classic gfx tbh, less poluted
[1:50:42] <%lotharrio> Glitch sniper.
[1:50:45] <Whyverns> I kinda dig the desert in the old version ngl
[1:50:46] <floralkami> Bonerlord keeps getting shot by moobot
[1:50:49] <%a_goth_pancake> time for halo stealth woolieMIRIN
[1:50:51] <blaggablag> I adore the early 2000 naive militarism of this. It's so quaint.
[1:50:52] <+Nobrev> isn't this mission kinda busted with new graphics?
[1:50:55] <Catpurrple> Remember, Gearbox fucked up the graphics with the original PC port of the game, and every single port since is based on that. Only the OG xbox one looks good.
[1:50:57] <ThatGuyThere03> I don't understand the classic graphics look fine
[1:50:58] <SableS139a> @sniff'>feelsbadman
[1:51:05] <%christopherwpoindexter> WAT

[1:51:16] <slatersev> There was a second Spartan on board
[1:51:17] <+Grayhammatter> jim halo

[1:51:27] <$QueequegTheater> yes
[1:51:27] <Joestar1890> Linda? maybe?
[1:51:28] <Louie_Salmon> Later games did a great job of having a reason for co-op
[1:51:28] <%subjectg> Linda, actually

[1:51:41] <+RowenCleric> Jammy Halo
[1:51:41] <DigitalJoshie> technically, in the anime it was spartan 1337
[1:51:43] <Spirit_NB> Doing this stealthy is very hard
[1:51:43] <Griffin1171> or Kelly
[1:51:46] <+SoeSpooky> is there actually another Spartan in cryo on the pillar?
[1:51:46] <Tuna_Can_0> @Bonerlord911 moobot doesnt like uppercase LUL
[1:51:46] <JetpackMcQuack> CoolStoryBob oh no they saw
[1:51:48] <thesoldierofjoy> there was another spartan with him, but she was unconcious in a cryo pod for the whole of this game.
[1:51:48] <%a_goth_pancake> @lotharrio except Linda, Fred, and Kelly
[1:51:51] <blaggablag> Juan Hola!
[1:51:52] <+EMFole> @woolieversus the version your playing is based off the old gearbox port, the original halo CE looked a bit better than the original graphics you're seeing right now
[1:51:53] <%Gruhunchously> There are drums
[1:51:57] <%christopherwpoindexter> this is also my bro's fav music in the game
[1:51:58] <DeathByPoke7> if yo get shot you de-scope
[1:51:58] <%lotharrio> Okay, so just most of them,
[1:52:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Linda was in cryo sleep
[1:52:02] <+JohnRSoviet> Yeah, Linda's nursing a plasma wound to the back of her head
[1:52:02] <+Metatermin8r> It would technically be Linda, but she's in cryo and basically dead during the events of CE, so unless she's out there fighting with MULTIPLE fucked organs....
[1:52:03] <slatersev> at the time of Halo 1 alot are still alive
[1:52:12] <%stemlo_> @lotharrio There are a couple here and there. Jun survived reach and Blue Team is in a pocket dimension or some shit
[1:52:12] <slatersev> Fred Kelly Linda Will Gray Team etc
[1:52:15] <+turolord> night vision
[1:52:17] <%a_goth_pancake> and Grace. and Sam. and Kurt. and Jun. and a few others who did between games anyway.
[1:52:25] <blaggablag> Or if you want the full title, Jefe Maestro Juan Hola
[1:52:26] <%dinnydanny777> Sniper is basically single shot shotgun
[1:52:26] <%brachydios777> Red team in cryo
[1:52:29] <dabeaminator> This room is hard on Heroic
[1:52:33] <thesoldierofjoy> and the spartan 3s.
[1:52:34] <+MrProw> New LP with Little V? DOOOOPE
[1:52:34] <slatersev> Kurt is training baby Spartans RIGHT NOW
[1:52:35] <%RioGascar> @stemlo_ ...pocket dimension???
[1:52:37] <Sauceboss15> LUL
[1:52:39] <%dinnydanny777> The sniper is basically a shotgun + sniper
[1:52:40] <+Metatermin8r> @stemlo_ Nope, Blue Team got out a while ago. They were even in Halo 5.
[1:52:41] <%Pinkiefan> Loved killing everything without breaking stealth. Sneaking around meleeing enemies in the back was super fun.
[1:52:42] <andrex2311> LUL
[1:52:45] <%superc37> ELITES woolie not the grunts
[1:52:46] <Griffin1171> Kurt's so fucking cool
[1:52:47] <+Kindan55> Guns in this game are busted in the best way
[1:52:48] <$QueequegTheater> Chosen Undead VS Master Chief time for a death battle
[1:52:49] <slatersev> the pocket dimension isnt until after halo 2
[1:52:55] <Fullmetal_Jedi> I like the look of the snper better in classic graphics
[1:52:58] <%stemlo_> @RioGascar Read "Ghosts of Onyx"
[1:53:00] <%Jake_Protagonist> Don’t forget to mention night vision with flash light in sniper
[1:53:00] <floralkami> who the heck is Linda and why is chat talking about her?
[1:53:00] <+ghostfaceninja_> 360 no scope 420 blaze it
[1:53:01] <%subjectg> Kurt is the best
[1:53:05] <%alpacasintophats> controls
[1:53:07] <%stemlo_> @Metatermin8r They aren't in as of CE?
[1:53:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Toggle crouch best crouch, just not for jumps
[1:53:12] <StarlitStunner> Kurt is the coolest
[1:53:13] <sniffy77> Linda is a Spartan II who is part of Blue Team.
[1:53:14] <%a_goth_pancake> ghost of onyx was the shit.
[1:53:19] <%dinnydanny777> If the Covenant had ID locked weapons Master Chief would have died by now
[1:53:20] <biomegabear> Im seeing woolie play halo and like WHAT?!
[1:53:22] <Bigyanno> These halo games have some really nice options

[1:54:09] <slatersev> I like how people are asking who Linda is when she was a fucking party member in 5. Goes to show huw bigly 5 failed
[1:54:13] <+Xero_J> 360 NOSCdang it
[1:54:14] <%brachydios777> Halo soundtrack Kreygasm
[1:54:14] <rubbishbinge> the aliens aren't contacting us, the animals are leaving, but we still have 360 no scopes
[1:54:15] <sniffy77> The EU basically did everything they could to justify Blue Team not being with chief
[1:54:17] <slatersev> fun fact
[1:54:20] <%dinnydanny777> This game is incredible for 2001
[1:54:22] <%dinnydanny777> Yes
[1:54:23] <%stemlo_> @Metatermin8r Huh. Got my continuity a little out of whack

[1:54:30] <slatersev> there is a canon Spartan named Sheila
[1:54:30] <+gerahwar> YUP
[1:54:30] <+How2BEpic> Yep. At least Halo 2
[1:54:31] <cowardman93> BIG YES
[1:54:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> @slater *bigly*
[1:54:31] <+FennecZephyr> Halo was teabagging
[1:54:32] <Fullmetal_Jedi> stimmt
[1:54:32] <%black_pariah> Under Cover Of Night is one of the best tracks
[1:54:33] <cowardman93> VoteYea

[1:54:33] <korth367> Tea Bag Lore
[1:54:33] <ThatGuyThere03> Hell yeah it was
[1:54:34] <%dinnydanny777> This game is amazing for 2001
[1:54:36] <%BisoromiBear> T bagging is an art
[1:54:36] <prince_johnny_> Yup
[1:54:37] <%a_goth_pancake> 720 no-scope!
[1:54:37] <+Fenrein> This was the game
[1:54:38] <Cykron> MOM GET THE CAMERA
[1:54:39] <+SashaStarshine> TBagging is an integral part of Halo Culture
[1:54:39] <SableS139a> Yep. Halo was the origin of teabagging
[1:54:40] <%Malik1002> look at wollie trying to use the sniper like a regular weapon
[1:54:41] <alrobot2014> bodies still have physics when you t bag em
[1:54:43] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BIRTH OR A LEGEND
[1:54:43] <iamtheTwitchghost> music SourPls

[1:54:50] <@Solidus_113> T-Bag so strong your lift picks up ragdolls
[1:54:52] <%brothernerofgc> thanks for the gift sub
[1:54:54] <The_RDDM> It was in PC games before, but refined here.
[1:54:55] <%dinnydanny777> This game is twenty years old and it's great
[1:54:58] <Cykron> This music is incredible
[1:54:58] <thesoldierofjoy> in halo 3 the ragdoll went nuts when you teabagged, they flopped around like crazy
[1:55:00] <slatersev> There is a canon Spartan 2 named Shiela and yes she was named after the tank from RVB
[1:55:03] <%christopherwpoindexter> HOW DID I NOT HEAR THIS MUSIC, I DON'T REMEMBER THIS
[1:55:04] <+omegasis> are they doing co-op?
[1:55:04] <rubbishbinge> wait, a game from 2001 is now 19 years old
[1:55:06] <%stemlo_> IMO The Halo books are, up to a certain point, some of the best Sci-Fi military novels written
[1:55:06] <+gerahwar> Thats how we asserted dominance in Halo back then
[1:55:07] <%brothernerofgc> i miss Halo
[1:55:09] <+How2BEpic> Bless Marty O'Donnell.

[1:55:24] <+Metatermin8r> No, Marty left Bungie while working on Destiny
[1:55:25] <dankvonmemelord> he got fired during destiny
[1:55:25] <The_RDDM> After destiny 1
[1:55:25] <%thechungiestofbois> He left after Destiny 1
[1:55:26] <+Lunaar> and during Destiny :<
[1:55:26] <karl_rex> After Destiny 1
[1:55:26] <KillMyPast> Wasnt the composer also the director?
[1:55:27] <%dinnydanny777> The Covenant did nothing wrong
[1:55:28] <PlasticJake> no he got fucked by Activision or something
[1:55:28] <floralkami> @slatersev i mean i never played Halo besides local multiplayer in the PC demo way back, but I've heard Halo 5 wasn't great
[1:55:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Marty O'Donnel is king he did ODST and Reach too
[1:55:29] <$QueequegTheater> Oh my god woolie\
[1:55:29] <+Fenrein> Marty O'Donnell is a legend

[1:55:32] <Cykron> After Destiny 1
[1:55:32] <+Lunaar> DURING* Destiny
[1:55:33] <prince_johnny_> After destiny
[1:55:34] <%Jake_Protagonist> After destiny
[1:55:35] <+krabsan> LUL
[1:55:35] <%a_goth_pancake> Marty got fired and Mikey stepped in.
[1:55:36] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Marty was fired during Destiny's production
[1:55:36] <slatersev> It was not
[1:55:40] <Ransom73> Isthis the first time Woolie has played the campaign?
[1:55:41] <%superc37> Marty left after destiny
[1:55:42] <blaggablag> apparently new management sort of shafted him
[1:55:43] <DigitalJoshie> he left bungie after destiny
[1:55:43] <Shisno27> during/after density
[1:55:45] <Griffin1171> Mendicant Bias did nothing wrong
[1:55:49] <+Lunaar> production on Destiny made many Bungie legends leave
[1:55:50] <%doomerskeletor13> He left Bungie during Destiny
[1:55:52] <+MaddyCaddy> Kinda weird how Jackals have stronger shields than Elites
[1:55:54] <%a_goth_pancake> and Mikey stepped in with his FUCKING SEX JAZZ
[1:55:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> do we know why he left?
[1:55:56] <Griffin1171> Forerunners were a mistake
[1:55:56] <%dinnydanny777> The famous Halo monks too of course
[1:56:02] <+A0N33> During Destiny and I think they pulled all of his music out of the game during development?
[1:56:04] <$QueequegTheater> "See me after class, Woolie"
[1:56:04] <StuffHunter> And "left" isn't accurate. More like "terminated without cause".
[1:56:05] <+D00msDayDan> he improvised the greatest dive bomb in history on the spot and got it in one
[1:56:05] <%Gruhunchously> See me after class
[1:56:07] <falyden> LUL
[1:56:08] <+Lunaar> it's for that reason I will never forgive Destiny as a whole
[1:56:10] <%subjectg> @griffin1171 he kinda did everything wrong man
[1:56:12] <dankvonmemelord> mjolnir mix slaps so damn hard
[1:56:13] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie needs to bust out that half-controller-half-mouse doohickey
[1:56:14] <sniffy77> Medicant Bias is a punk ass bitch. This post brought to you by Offensive Bias gang.
[1:56:15] <megatronsdong96> those grunts were just vibing
[1:56:15] <+Metatermin8r> @floralkami It gets a worse rap than it deserves. Terrible campaign story wise, but the gameplay and multiplayer are both pretty damn fun.
[1:56:16] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Marty is working with a independent company now
[1:56:16] <VestigeOuroboros> The video of the school kids in the bathroom doing a cover of the halo monks
[1:56:17] <dabeaminator> @Griffin1171 He did literally everything wrong
[1:56:18] <VestigeOuroboros> Is great
[1:56:20] <Shisno27> they made him eat a whole mess of raw meat
[1:56:25] <slatersev> gotta get to Halo 2 for Breaking Benjamin
[1:56:30] <sniffy77> Medicant Bias broke the first 11 halo rings
[1:56:40] <+mckraven> Activision used a different song for one of Destiny's E3 trailers and it really pissed him off. he publicly called them out and was fired

[1:57:24] <floralkami> @metatermin8r that doesn't much surprise me, cause it seems like a lot of gun games the past 5 years only had campaigns to justify creating a new multiplayer market
[1:57:26] <SableS139a> @dinnydanny777 In CE, Active Camo is always active until it's time is up.
[1:57:29] <Griffin1171> switch to old graphics for that
[1:57:32] <Sauceboss15> HUNTER TIME BABY
[1:57:34] <%Gruhunchously> So yeah, the remastered graphics are based off of Gearbox's botched PC port. Randy Pitchford continues to ruin everything he touches.

[1:58:29] <Darth_Mama> DJ Keemstar guest appearance?
[1:58:30] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> @Gruhunchously and the multiplayer is using the PC exclusive maps but yeah, the Gearbox version ruined a lot of the textures, lighting and effects
[1:58:30] <%christopherwpoindexter> @gruhunchously damn I didn't know he was that bad woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:58:31] <%brachydios777> Also for Halo fans, Banishef Confirmed
[1:58:31] <dabeaminator> Since player 2 is a generic elite during Arbiter missions in H2, I wish you were an ODST in Chief missions. Double Chief was always weird.
[1:58:33] <%a_goth_pancake> what a team killing fucktard.
[1:58:37] <%dinnydanny777> V is going to have to team kill Woolie three times to reassert his gaming dominance
[1:58:41] <%SuperKirby24> Vote: Kick Y/N
[1:58:47] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @dabeaminator Yeah lol

[1:59:09] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:59:10] <%dinnydanny777> V needs to get his k/d ratio back on top of Woolie's
[1:59:14] <Solidnick18> yes
[1:59:19] <+Dan_Backslide94> Guessin this is on easy and W has NEVER played a halo game
[1:59:19] <Sauceboss15> nvm
[1:59:19] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Hunters get killed by one pistol shot in CE
[1:59:21] <+JohnRSoviet> unless they have a front-back
[1:59:21] <%christopherwpoindexter> @sauceboss15 maybe Black Mesa trained him well

[2:00:04] <%Pinkiefan> Is this normal difficulty?

[2:00:38] <axegang> WOOLIE PLAYING HALO POG
[2:00:38] <Solidnick18> HUNTERS
[2:00:38] <%Asuterisuku> Hi there, Hunters!
[2:00:39] <floralkami> i don't think V is worst, he's just much more embodying the Co-op funzies than Woolie "let's be calm and calculated" Madden
[2:00:41] <%a_goth_pancake> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:00:43] <Ransom73> LUL
[2:00:44] <Joestar1890> MIDRIFFS
[2:00:46] <%lotharrio> Oh right, Hunters.
[2:00:47] <+GrumbleGrouse> shoot the orange

[2:00:50] <+Kindan55> squishy orange bois
[2:00:50] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SableS139a
[2:00:50] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> One fatal flaw: They fought John Halo
[2:00:51] <%dinnydanny777> They have exposed sides
[2:00:55] <+Strelok608> shoot the orange bits
[2:00:55] <CursedNobleman> thats a very ergonomic turret Kreygasm
[2:00:56] <unclekulikov> NO DONT SPOIL THE SECRET TECH
[2:00:56] <DeRedBaron> I love hunters
[2:00:57] <%lotharrio> Giant worms
[2:00:59] <Griffin1171> ITS QUIET
[2:01:00] <Sauceboss15> THAT FATAL FLAW BEING TURRETS
[2:01:03] <Joestar1890> Hunters are weak to midriffs
[2:01:04] <%superc37> PISTOL
[2:01:06] <%Asuterisuku> Hunters are already dead.
[2:01:06] <%RioGascar> One fatal flaw, pistol + back
[2:01:12] <%dinnydanny777> Except in Reach
[2:01:13] <DeRedBaron> sad they get used less in teh second game
[2:01:15] <dabeaminator> Not on Heroic
[2:01:15] <+Dan_Backslide94> Hunters are compiled of worms. They are literally a giant bulge of worms in the form of a creature
[2:01:15] <ThatGuyThere03> you gotta juke em out though
[2:01:19] <+Grizzytron> Fatal flaw: Gun
[2:01:19] <StarlitStunner> Worms in an armor suit
[2:01:19] <%dinnydanny777> Yep, except in Reach
[2:01:21] <Griffin1171> PISTOL
[2:01:21] <%lotharrio> Invulnerable to everything else.
[2:01:21] <Mr_Taters > Hunters are great
[2:01:22] <megatronsdong96> they're like zelda bosses
[2:01:22] <slatersev> Halo 1 pistol is legit one of the most broken weapons ever
[2:01:23] <@Solidus_113> Look up!
[2:01:24] <Catpurrple> They do not like their meat being shot.
[2:01:24] <Louie_Salmon> You should really examine the actual weak spot
[2:01:28] <geassguy360> cant wait for 3 where they actually call you john
[2:01:30] <dabeaminator> They're worm colonies in armor.
[2:01:35] <Spirit_NB> It even works in Legendary
[2:01:35] <+Strelok608> scarabs are also the same thing as hunters, jsut much much larger
[2:01:38] <sniffy77> They programmed headshots to be instant kills, but they made the orange bit count as a head
[2:01:39] <PlasticJake> and then they ruined it in future games
[2:01:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> [SHOOT HERE TO KILL ME]
[2:01:41] <Joestar1890> Get abducted!
[2:01:43] <Sauceboss15> @dinnydanny777 reach hunters are best hunters
[2:01:45] <%dinnydanny777> ITS A MARK FIVE
[2:01:46] <+SoeSpooky> pretty much dirge from star wars
[2:01:51] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus FUn fact, Hunters are actually sapient pairs of soul-bonded worm colonies
[2:01:52] <cowardman93> like the sin scissors in DMC
[2:01:53] <%brachydios777> @sniffy77 LUL

[2:02:34] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Remember when Bungie took their time to make the Halo games, unlike 343 who rushed their games

[2:03:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This room sucks shit on Legendary
[2:03:01] <floralkami> brought a sword to a gun fight
[2:03:01] <+gerahwar> Until Halo 2
[2:03:02] <+Metatermin8r> Bungie did love their Aliens
[2:03:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> unless you have a shotgun Kappa
[2:03:05] <Griffin1171> Its the sword from Fable
[2:03:07] <ralphfromdk> Which is why we need you to play 2 after this :p
[2:03:07] <+How2BEpic> It is in fact, not energy sword sunday.
[2:03:07] <+SoeSpooky> the energy pistol is so underrated
[2:03:09] <%Gruhunchously> Did you just turn invisible?
[2:03:10] <+NickHatesSnow> Not even sunday
[2:03:10] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> You know what you can be a Sword Boy in though? KILLER INSTINCT.
[2:03:11] <%Lizard0TM> Master chief doesn't master the blade until Hal;o 2
[2:03:11] <%Asuterisuku> Don't hold on to the plasma pistol charge like that it wastes battery.
[2:03:13] <%christopherwpoindexter> I HATE THOSE BOIS, AND apparently it's nerfed once players get to use the swords, how unfair woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:03:15] <%superc37> not until 2
[2:03:21] <%a_goth_pancake> @floralkami and WON
[2:03:21] <dabeaminator> God I hope they do the whole series
[2:03:23] <Sauceboss15> FLOATY GREEN BALL
[2:03:33] <%dinnydanny777> They should have updated it so you could use the sword
[2:03:33] <%RioGascar> They probably will
[2:03:37] <VestigeOuroboros> There's no reason to play the first without playing all of them
[2:03:39] <+Dan_Backslide94> I mean sword for bois is good foor ' parasite exstermination '
[2:03:42] <%RioGascar> Halo 1 is pretty short all things considered
[2:03:43] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Energy Sword become available in Halo 2
[2:03:43] <%Gruhunchously> @Sauceboss15 Heavy Metal style.
[2:03:47] <+ghostfaceninja_> totally cant see the bright glowing orb of energy Kappa
[2:03:47] <%RioGascar> like maybe 3 sessions
[2:03:48] <korth367> try the plasma rifle woolie
[2:03:53] <Louie_Salmon> Jesus
[2:03:53] <%krispen_wa> wow original graphics look so much cooler
[2:03:54] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:03:54] <%christopherwpoindexter> i'm glad and amazed that plasma pistol doesn't overheat or explode when you're waiting at full charge woolieCHAN
[2:03:54] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[2:03:56] <Shisno27> 360 plasma shot
[2:04:00] <%Asuterisuku> V Death Count: 4
[2:04:00] <%dinnydanny777> V 4/0 Woolie 0/0
[2:04:04] <+SuichiTanaka> Plasma pistol was secretly OP in Halo CE. Bungie nerfed it into the ground for the sequels.
[2:04:06] <Solidnick18> woolie has practice
[2:04:08] <Halospaz117> Woolie Halo
[2:04:09] <%DappercatEsquire> G A M E R woolie
[2:04:09] <Joestar1890> Alpha Gamer Woolie
[2:04:11] <Louie_Salmon> And Woolie didn't actually look at the weak spot so he doesn't know where it is
[2:04:13] <%Asuterisuku> We should count Betrayals against Woolie, though.
[2:04:13] <dabeaminator> 1, 2 , and 3 combined would probably still be a shorter playlist than KOTOR
[2:04:14] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Man, V has been a really great addition to the Woolie Versus Conglomerate, all these games he's gotten us.
[2:04:18] <%dinnydanny777> Woolie Haloman
[2:04:18] <VestigeOuroboros> Oh no he's caught mihn's color blindness
[2:04:19] <$QueequegTheater> oh my god
[2:04:20] <+Dan_Backslide94> I prefer the old days where Charging the plasma ppistol and holding it charged didnt drain battery
[2:04:24] <%dinnydanny777> Woolie Haloman confirmed
[2:04:26] <+jetjagger222> the sexy armor cutout
[2:04:27] <invader_rin> Were Hunters always smaller in the old games?
[2:04:27] <DesertPenguin> lol
[2:04:28] <floralkami> 0-4 Woolie v V
[2:04:28] <%Gruhunchously> At least we have all these meat shields....er, allies to keep them busy
[2:04:28] <%krispen_wa> NO SCOPE
[2:04:30] <SixthSun2> It's basically their whole abdomen
[2:04:31] <+Metatermin8r> Woolie confirmed blind
[2:04:35] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> The Hunters are easy to kill in CE. just one bullet in the back and they're dead
[2:04:38] <megatronsdong96> his weak point is his ego
[2:04:38] <RahuHordika> Just shoo them in the back
[2:04:38] <%AlphaTauri> yea the bellybutton
[2:04:40] <%superc37> the flesh under the armor
[2:04:41] <%Asuterisuku> V shouldn't have told Woolie about their weakness before he fought them.
[2:04:41] <Griffin1171> ORANGE
[2:04:41] <floralkami> *V v Woolie
[2:04:42] <+Kindan55> Haha, Hunters wear bikini armour
[2:04:43] <%christopherwpoindexter> @dabeaminator unless you're playing thru the highest difficulty for the first time, EVEN THEN, STILL
[2:04:43] <hattrick61> sexy midriff armor
[2:04:46] <%SuperKirby24> FaZeWoolie wen
[2:04:46] <$QueequegTheater> @Dan_Backslide94 You have it backwards, it used to drain it but now it doesn't
[2:04:47] <%dinnydanny777> V needs to kill Woolie 5 times to update his score
[2:04:47] <BlackermanZX> woolie went from 0/75 to 75/75 real quick
[2:04:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> *For the first time in the Halo trilogy
[2:04:58] <+ghostfaceninja_> fire the guy who designed their armor
[2:04:59] <%dinnydanny777> Well swap guns
[2:05:02] <+SoeSpooky> crop top hunters
[2:05:02] <+Dan_Backslide94> I don't remember it happening on the original @QueequegTheater
[2:05:04] <+jetjagger222> it sucked they didn't drop their weapons
[2:05:06] <%Gruhunchously> Hunters are demonstrations on why midriff armor is impractical
[2:05:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:05:07] <+How2BEpic> I wonder when woolie will die for the first time, and if it will be from his own actions.
[2:05:10] <+Dan_Backslide94> Look see his battery isnt draining
[2:05:11] <%christopherwpoindexter> pick up another plasma pistol woolieLORE woolieREMEMBERS
[2:05:11] <%quinnage7> @woolieversus Ask V about what Hunters actually are
[2:05:12] <dabeaminator> @christopherwpoindexter Especially since they're on normal with two people. This'll go quick
[2:05:15] <DesertPenguin> It's not DOOM, there's no chainsaw
[2:05:16] <floralkami> wait Woolie, where's your pistol?
[2:05:19] <+Dan_Backslide94> So I was right
[2:05:19] <+Fenrein> Plasma weapons don't pick up ammo like UNSC weapons do
[2:05:26] <+jetjagger222> KAMEHAME HA
[2:05:27] <@Menitta> oh god the classic makes that gun look like a sausage

[2:08:51] <%christopherwpoindexter> it looked like the rifle got thrown forward when it swapped
[2:08:55] <+Byronic_dreamer> the real murder combo is plasma rifle and magnum
[2:08:57] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> @Louie_Salmon and it was the Last Halo game made by Bungie :(
[2:08:58] <dabeaminator> Brute Plasma is amazing in 3.
[2:09:01] <+ghostfaceninja_> he looks its the GOOD mid range weapon
[2:09:07] <+Byronic_dreamer> shield goes bye bye then face goes bye bye
[2:09:13] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Reach was Bungie Swan Song to Halo
[2:09:15] <stormhawk9891> I absolutely love dual smgs in 2
[2:09:29] <%Asuterisuku> When the shield goes down you swap for your Precision weapon.
[2:09:33] <+Byronic_dreamer> dual wielding an SMG and plasma rifle was the shit
[2:09:34] <EDFscout> What's the Team-kill score RN?

[2:10:59] <scallycap> this is why the high ground is important
[2:10:59] <+SuichiTanaka> In Halo: CE, the plasma pistol is true semi-auto. It fires as fast as you can feather the trigger, meaning if you're really good at using it, you can strip shields faster than a plasma rifle.
[2:11:01] <%MrMoonGoose> Wonder how many of us are going 'da nunununununununununah, dunununu' along with the music

[2:13:48] <%christopherwpoindexter> where?! ohh, I can never find skulls
[2:13:50] <+lethallunacyx> Most people will say 2 has best multi because it has a proper ranking system
[2:13:50] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Until 2
[2:13:53] <%dinnydanny777> I seem to remember an Elite who didn't speak
[2:13:54] <sniffy77> grunts have the shittiest life in halo. Their planet is a frozen methane shithole with fire tornados that randomly appear everywhere.
[2:13:58] <Nomad94> @dinnydanny777 there weren't any translators for elite language around during Halo 1, that's the lore reason
[2:13:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Reach is the multiplayer I have the most fondness for
[2:13:58] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> @dinnydanny777 they do speak english but until halo 2

[2:16:43] <Shisno27> 2000 is way past the legal age to drink
[2:16:43] <XScytheMata> Halo 4 Cortana is hottest but best Cortana is Halo 2
[2:16:43] <Nomad94> US drinking age, huh? [laughs in Germany]
[2:16:47] <Halospaz117> Yeah, Cotrana's 3 design is my favorite
[2:16:51] <+D00msDayDan> cloaked elites don't have shields altogether
[2:17:00] <Solidnick18> yeah
[2:17:02] <Nomad94> @Shisno27 only in cool countries CoolCat
[2:17:06] <HyperBomb21> Halo 1 is has the best campaign
[2:17:07] <%krispen_wa> I like Halo 3 Cortana because her hair is blue still
[2:17:10] <%christopherwpoindexter> @queequegtheater woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:17:20] <%Space_Pagan> FOR MANDALORE
[2:17:20] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[2:17:21] <dabeaminator> @XScytheMata Hell no, H4 cortana sucks. She's got that weird tooth gap.
[2:17:21] <Shisno27> if you are 2000 years old I think you can drink whatever you want
[2:17:22] <%Gruhunchously> Dam that shield is making the same noise as my stopwatch
[2:17:25] <%RioGascar> Halo 3 for best campaign
[2:17:28] <Nomad94> the lore for that is Cloaks take up the energy supply that a shield would otherwise consume
[2:17:28] <penitentpentwitch> That's not the worst advice
[2:17:30] <%RioGascar> Halo 2 for best mp
[2:17:32] <Nomad94> so they can't have both
[2:17:34] <+How2BEpic> Rand through the fire and flames.
[2:17:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> Never stop going in
[2:17:40] <karl_rex> Halo 3 for worst sotry
[2:17:50] <slatersev> 5 is worst story brag
[2:17:51] <+jetjagger222> @karl_rex hell yeah that was a mess
[2:17:54] <%Gruhunchously> Go in like the US Marshalls
[2:17:56] <%BisoromiBear> Halo Custom Edition has the best MP
[2:17:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait is this CE or Anniversary
[2:17:58] <scallycap> even the elite runs through grenades
[2:17:58] <+Shirikova> Uh, Halo 5 for worst story?
[2:18:00] <Nomad94> 5's story is a mess
[2:18:00] <%brachydios777> @karl_rex Seriously?
[2:18:01] <+turolord> halo 4 for worst story
[2:18:04] <%christopherwpoindexter> @karl_rex oh no, really? uh oh
[2:18:08] <HyperBomb21> Halo 4 was when it started getting really bad.
[2:18:14] <Nomad94> Halo 4 was fine
[2:18:16] <%subjectg> @gruhunchously get pills against my orders!
[2:18:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[2:18:16] <andrei11dr> Halo 4 had a great campain
[2:18:17] <manleybeard> missed a chunk while driving around, has Woolie checked out the ol'Needler yet?
[2:18:18] <$QueequegTheater> 4's story is good
[2:18:18] <Nomad94> 5 dropped the ball
[2:18:20] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I like Reach the most in a few ways, story one of them, though ODST was also real high up on atmosphere.
[2:18:22] <%dinnydanny777> Is Cortana a manic pixie dream girl
[2:18:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 343 for worst story and games
[2:18:23] <+Shirikova> Halo 4 has moments that are great in the middle of eh
[2:18:25] <HyperBomb21> 343 turned Halo 4 into a Call of Duty clone
[2:18:26] <+nameless191> 4 had good story
[2:18:28] <slatersev> Halo 4 plot is mid at best, but the character stuff with Chief and Cortana is rad
[2:18:28] <+jetjagger222> change my view: halo/Gears was the contra of the xbox generation
[2:18:29] <Shisno27> he has needled
[2:18:34] <DigitalJoshie> halo 4 had awful MP, but a pretty good story
[2:18:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> what difficulty is htis
[2:18:38] <%ChoculaUltra> nermal
[2:18:39] <%Pinkiefan> 4 had horrible level design
[2:18:39] <phantalime> halo 4 is great imo, 5 however 😬😬😬
[2:18:39] <dabeaminator> It's simple. Bungie logo = good game, 343 logo = bad game.
[2:18:40] <iamtheTwitchghost> friendly fire atpRtsd
[2:18:42] <slatersev> 5 is just nad all around
[2:18:44] <%brachydios777> 4 was underrated , 5’s story is bad
[2:18:48] <DigitalJoshie> then the switched it up for halo 5
[2:18:50] <+turolord> 343 gilty for bad story
[2:18:50] <$QueequegTheater> NICE
[2:18:51] <sniffy77> For Halo Infinite they really need to change how the elites are. They aren't that fun to deal with in 4 and 5
[2:18:53] <%lotharrio> STickied!
[2:18:54] <Nomad94> nice
[2:18:54] <%dinnydanny777> 4 Was fine
[2:18:55] <CurrySauseBandit> I think woolie doesn't realize there's a regular fire mode for the plasma pistol LUL
[2:18:58] <Solidnick18> sick
[2:18:59] <%Pinkiefan> I feel like 5 wasn't a Halo game
[2:19:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Woolie seems like he's having fun, Co-op is lovely.
[2:19:05] <Darmanimon> woolie feels like the teammate you'd hate to have in Left 4 Dead cuz he'd always think you're a zombie and shoot you LUL
[2:19:06] <+D00msDayDan> somebody should tell woolie you can shoot the plasma pistol without overcharging it
[2:19:07] <%christopherwpoindexter> @currysausebandit yeah...
[2:19:10] <biomegabear> Oh yeah this game lets you hold it withut batery drain
[2:19:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1275210654773915649?s=20
[2:19:12] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> 5 whats that
[2:19:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> LiquidDinosaur subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hell yeah, glad to see Woolie playing the Adventures of John Halo, a pretty cool guy who kills aliens and doesn't afraid of anything
[2:19:18] <HyperBomb21> Nobody talking about Reach LUL
[2:19:20] <Nomad94> @CurrySauseBandit honestly charging it is the better option in 90% of situations
[2:19:21] <slatersev> 3 story is the worst in the oG trilogy cause its just the end of Halo 2 dragged out for nine levels
[2:19:22] <Shisno27> but why would you shoot it without charging it
[2:19:25] <%Tearonex> Thanks for the PridePog @liquiddinosaur
[2:19:25] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> I remember how bad the Story is
[2:19:35] <XScytheMata> halo 4 was boring but fortunately is not halo 5, halo 5 was a massive trainwreck
[2:19:36] <%christopherwpoindexter> @hyperbomb21 because it's not numbered? woolieSMUG
[2:19:41] <%dinnydanny777> We haven't seen the Grunt grenade party trick yet have we
[2:19:43] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Multiplayer in 5is a mixed bag for me
[2:19:46] <+SuichiTanaka> Charged plasma pistol is easier to use when starting. Semi-auto fire is better when you're really good at feathering the trigger
[2:19:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> Grunts ARE grenades Kappa
[2:19:47] <+How2BEpic> another one increases explosion radius. It's hell.
[2:19:48] <Nomad94> @Shisno27 I can see its use if you have nothing else and something without a shield comes along, so you can finish it off
[2:19:50] <DigitalJoshie> 343 isn't awful but they have so many ideas that are half baked that they don't finish
[2:19:55] <%dinnydanny777> We still haven't seen the Grunt grenade tech yet
[2:19:56] <$QueequegTheater> warp warp warp
[2:19:57] <%a_goth_pancake> 5 was cool, I like Locke. and Buck as a Spartan is all I've ever wanted. And we got to see a glasses colony, and Sanghelios, and Cortana was a bitch
[2:19:58] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Halo Wars was a cool game, underrated RTS.
[2:19:58] <CurrySauseBandit> @Nomad94 Yeah. Outside of efficiency. It was just a funny observation
[2:20:00] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> But The worst part about 5 is those MICROTRANSACTION WutFace
[2:20:02] <andrei11dr> Also people forget how good Halo 4 looked at the time
[2:20:02] <DinoBear_7> The regular shot for the plasma pistol is actually decent in CE. Far more ammo efficient
[2:20:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> Zealot
[2:20:06] <%brachydios777> I heard Halo Wars 2 is good
[2:20:07] <+GrumbleGrouse> NotLikeThis
[2:20:09] <HyperBomb21> Reach is still a mainline game though
[2:20:13] <$QueequegTheater> @a_goth_pancake Cortana died in 4
[2:20:14] <slatersev> Wars 2 is good
[2:20:18] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Halo Wars 2 is probably pretty good too, 1 was cool.
[2:20:18] <Nomad94> Reach is my favourite, I played it so much
[2:20:19] <%christopherwpoindexter> @hyperbomb21 right?!
[2:20:20] <slatersev> Banished are cool
[2:20:20] <+JohnRSoviet> Halo Wars was surprisingly fun
[2:20:21] <XScytheMata> i still want to believe in infinite tho
[2:20:23] <%Gruhunchously> This might be it
[2:20:23] <slatersev> Jerome is cool
[2:20:25] <%brachydios777> @queequegtheater Should of
[2:20:28] <Nomad94> I am too dumb for Halo Wars
[2:20:29] <%a_goth_pancake> @queequegtheater right, I forgot LUL
[2:20:31] <iamtheTwitchghost> ouch

[2:20:34] <+ghostfaceninja_> remember trying to feather the trigger on the duke FeelsBadMan
[2:20:34] <%christopherwpoindexter> halo wars seems like the original vision of Halo from, like, 1998
[2:20:34] <$QueequegTheater> 2
[2:20:35] <%dinnydanny777> Now the score's 6-2!

[2:20:50] <Darmanimon> hey so is it only Woolie streaming or do we get to see Little V's perspective too on a different stream?
[2:20:50] <ColbyBryant> Gamered
[2:20:51] <%a_goth_pancake> 4 on the other hand... I mean it played nice
[2:20:51] <+cubbywolf> halo wars is teeribly unbalanced at high levels
[2:20:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> this music sounds new
[2:20:59] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Halo Wars is the big brain patrician's RTS
[2:21:00] <Nomad94> The terminal
[2:21:03] <Shisno27> V's perspective is anime only
[2:21:07] <%subjectg> This is the bridge btw
[2:21:11] <%dinnydanny777> Oh dear
[2:21:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This room...
[2:21:19] <floralkami> @darmanimon anime only
[2:21:20] <AppleBerryKitty> you know you can click and skip it right?
[2:21:20] <Darmanimon> ok, I might just watch the anime then
[2:21:22] <%brachydios777> Spoilers
[2:21:22] <%christopherwpoindexter> those terminals are also def remastered only
[2:21:24] <Nomad94> cool that he knows where those are, I forgot about a few
[2:21:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> is he mostly playing on Classic or New graphics
[2:21:27] <Darmanimon> ty chat, have a good one!
[2:21:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> Big Spoiler Cutscene stuff
[2:21:32] <$QueequegTheater> Mostly new
[2:21:35] <dabeaminator> Halo Wars wasn't worth playing until it got the PC port.
[2:21:37] <+Merhabi> Amine?
[2:21:38] <%BinaryFireball> they should really just have a settings toggle disabling those
[2:21:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> He's swapping fairly regular on the visuals
[2:21:44] <%brachydios777> Terminals are really great ideas
[2:21:48] <%dinnydanny777> I wonder what that room looked like in classic
[2:21:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @dabeaminator is 2 good?
[2:21:50] <marvel877> They add in stuff for the Anniversary edition.
[2:21:51] <%christopherwpoindexter> @darmanimon SeemsGood
[2:21:52] <+Shirikova> Halo wars is on pc?
[2:21:55] <XScytheMata> the only downside of Halo Wars is the Scarab mission D:
[2:21:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> Yeah i havent played this remake yet but i feel like when i do i'll be switching between constntly
[2:21:58] <Darmanimon> Merhabi the youtube channel
[2:21:59] <%dinnydanny777> Needler looks really metallic in Classic
[2:22:06] <%brachydios777> Also they add a good bunch to the story
[2:22:06] <%Asuterisuku> Upressed to 4k, actually.
[2:22:07] <dabeaminator> @BallerSwagBro9k 2 is great. Much better than 1.
[2:22:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Remember when H2A put a bunch of H5 shit in the cutscenes?
[2:22:10] <+turolord> halo wars so how made a rats playable on console
[2:22:12] <+Fenrein> Woolie gets it
[2:22:18] <+ghostfaceninja_> yea so far he's swaping back and forth equally
[2:22:25] <%Asuterisuku> @CanadianAnimatorGuy As someone new to the series, that genuinely pissed me off.
[2:22:29] <%Mrthefro> I never noticed that
[2:22:29] <%christopherwpoindexter> @asuterisuku that's a word
[2:22:30] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SNIPERSCOPE
[2:22:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> For real.
[2:22:34] <%ChoculaUltra> I can't be the only one who thought the needler ammo looked tasty as a kid. Like candy. Just ignore me.
[2:22:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> IIRC it points to the big planet, Threshhold
[2:22:38] <Axle13j> wow I either NEVER noticed that or forgot lol
[2:22:39] <slatersev> seeing V's chief in game gives me RVB flashbacks
[2:22:42] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The needler was always one of my favorite guns in the series, I like how it works, it looks cool, I love the melee animation.
[2:22:42] <andrei11dr> I never noticed that
[2:22:42] <$jake5713> I NEVER NOTICED THAT!!!
[2:22:45] <%christopherwpoindexter> i noticed that early on woolieREMEMBERS
[2:22:45] <slatersev> cant wait for RVB ZERO
[2:22:48] <%Gruhunchously> HOw would North even work on a ring world like this?
[2:22:51] <%brachydios777> Secret Mechanics
[2:22:52] <%raven_frame> What is North on this ring?
[2:22:53] <sniffy77> needler ammo in canon is bullshit according to human scientists
[2:22:55] <+Merhabi> It's gotta be on a timer or something, no way he's manually switching feeds while playing
[2:22:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Its from Aliens
[2:22:57] <Spirit_NB> And you can see your teammate's ammo counter, even online
[2:23:04] <%dinnydanny777> 56 bullets
[2:23:04] <CurrySauseBandit> @Axle13j It's very much a forget
[2:23:05] <dabeaminator> I assume north points clockwise
[2:23:05] <%xyxlzyzm> north is the bigass triangle what are you saying
[2:23:05] <%christopherwpoindexter> it's like right there y'all. jk i'm giving y'all a hard time
[2:23:12] <%dinnydanny777> Woolie you should reload
[2:23:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> white is progress
[2:23:24] <%christopherwpoindexter> it's white, not red
[2:23:34] <+cubbywolf> the ring is still bigger than some moons
[2:23:35] <Cykron> The compass points towards the gas giant planet Halo orbits

[2:24:30] <+Merhabi> are their color settings different between the feeds?
[2:24:32] <dabeaminator> Halo ended after Reach
[2:24:33] <+cubbywolf> halo has always had bad levels though esp halob1
[2:24:38] <%christopherwpoindexter> so funny seeing classic graphics. god so many remasters would be so much better if they gave you an option to swap out classic graphics any time you want. sonic DX, mario 64 ds...then again I'm a boomer from '98 who remembers when remasters were almost always worse LUL woolieREMEMBERS
[2:24:39] <Nomad94> The Library is the worst level

[2:25:30] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @christopherwpoindexter Yeah, newer remaster games doing this sort of thing is fantastic. The remaster of Command and Conquer 1 recently does it too, where you can switch between the hyper crispy original grayfix or the new smoothed pretty visuals.

[2:25:39] <%Asuterisuku> @LiquidDinosaur The original PC port fucked them, the remake just didn't unfuck them.
[2:25:43] <dabeaminator> Yeah the anniversaries are the only good thing 343 ever did. Sucks they ignored 3 for no reason.
[2:25:47] <Catpurrple> @LiquidDinosaur Yeah, they're supposed to change colors with the damage they take, but that was one of the things gearbox fucked up that was never fixed.

[2:27:49] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> The Halo Rings were made for a particular purpose
[2:27:50] <dabeaminator> It's a Death Star on a galactic scale Woolie, he's not exaggerating
[2:27:52] <Griffin1171> This part of the mission sucks on Heroic
[2:27:55] <derap41> wort wort wort
[2:27:56] <+Byronic_dreamer> its appropriate in this story though, the fate of the human race at the least is counting entirely on the military.
[2:28:00] <+TheShisno> Halo chapter titles are the best
[2:28:03] <%christopherwpoindexter> ESCORT MISSION TIME
[2:28:05] <Nomad94> @Griffin1171 Keyes falls over from a stiff breeze on Legendary
[2:28:09] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @The_Bravest_Coward Yeah, they're really visually nice games, the first one doesn't play all that great, but the sequels made them play a lot more fun too.
[2:28:10] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> This Track PogChamp
[2:28:14] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[2:28:14] <thesoldierofjoy> also if Keyes dies, you reload last checkpoint
[2:28:15] <MooseoneLivedhere> friendly fire?
[2:28:19] <The_Bravest_Coward> Defund the Spartans guys.
[2:28:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dabeaminator i mean the way Halo works nevr made any sense. The Flood seem to have no problem eating non-sentient biomass
[2:28:21] <+TheShisno> Can't wait for them to see "I Would Have Been Your Daddy..."
[2:28:21] <%christopherwpoindexter> @nomad94 I'M so not looking forward to that
[2:28:22] <AnthroMetal> god i love the ai in halo
[2:28:25] <iamtheTwitchghost> the chain reaction explosions are the best
[2:28:28] <Shisno27> this part sucks when you're on legendary with all the grunts exploding and all explosions turned up and everyone dropping and throwing more grenades
[2:28:29] <UvBenServed> Sorry I fuckin shot your Chief
[2:28:30] <derap41> Also if you shoot thenm
[2:28:30] <bearalin> Anyone else see that marine T pose out of the cutscene?
[2:28:31] <+RealThiele> ASAB
[2:28:34] <UvBenServed> you
[2:28:34] <%Gruhunchously> "WAS TI SOMETHING I SAID!?"
[2:28:34] <%Asuterisuku> @NewAndTastySixthHouse See, I disagree. At least the guns feel good to use in 1.
[2:28:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> yeah that is a war crime
[2:28:38] <DinoBear_7> Keyes will sometimes shoot a corpse and kill himself
[2:28:38] <$QueequegTheater> STOP RESiSTING
[2:28:42] <+ghostfaceninja_> say what you will about its efficacy, the needler is fun to fire
[2:28:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> but then again the UNSC is a fascist shithole
[2:28:46] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Bungie Halo >>>>>>>>>>> 343 Halo
[2:28:49] <%SuperKirby24> my bad, I shot you in the head 4Head
[2:28:54] <+JohnRSoviet> the "rage shots" carry over to sequels too
[2:28:56] <%Gruhunchously> OOH RAH
[2:28:57] <+Metatermin8r> Fun fact: During development, Keys would do the Marine taunt of shooting dead Covenant because he used the same AI. But with a needler, which means he would supercombine the corpse and fucking die which is a reset.
[2:28:57] <%ChoculaUltra> I've had Keyes run and sit on grenades.
[2:28:58] <vaderxyz1970> WELLLLLLL
[2:29:04] <correctedsun117> They used to shoot at dead bodies with the Needler and Bungie had to fix it before the game shipped
[2:29:04] <XxCGxOblivionxX> ewww anniversary graphics
[2:29:07] <+TheShisno> No such thing as war crimes against aliens who don't follow human laws
[2:29:08] <%NovaKnightmare> what difficulty Woolie playing on?
[2:29:09] <%dinnydanny777> Everyone should really stop talking about stuff that happens much later in the game...
[2:29:09] <%christopherwpoindexter> @queequegtheater what is this, Live P.D. Kappa
[2:29:10] <The_Bravest_Coward> @LiquidDinosaur Yeah, I too hate being protected from alien threats
[2:29:12] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Asuterisuku I dunno, 1 always felt like it was very like, I felt like I never had purpose to use other guns than theeee, what was the like AR that was just way too good lol
[2:29:13] <+AFoolishPaper> giving the ai power weapons is the best
[2:29:13] <%Gruhunchously> @Metatermin8r That's hilarious
[2:29:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Sheilds have eliminated the need for trigger discipline
[2:29:19] <%RioGascar> i mean...its a alien that is figthing the entire human race. I dont think war crimes count
[2:29:20] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur sounds like innie talk to me
[2:29:22] <sniffy77> Post H3 UNSC canon is basically "ONI stops being cunts" and then ONI says no
[2:29:25] <Cykron> I mean if you're fighting and actually killing the evil alien menace you'd get excited too
[2:29:26] <+RealThiele> AI require missile launcher duh
[2:29:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> and they were shitty fascists even before an existential threat to the human race made such harshness justifiable. Like they were experimenting on kids to make supersoldiers when their biggest threat was pirates
[2:29:30] <%christopherwpoindexter> DOUBLE KILL *narrator voice*
[2:29:36] <%RioGascar> i also got no clue if the geneva conventions apply off earth
[2:29:36] <$QueequegTheater> DOUBLE KILL TRiPLE KiLL OVERKiLL KiLLTACULAR
[2:29:39] <thesoldierofjoy> lol the AI for the Rebels in the old Star Wars Battlefront 2- the good one- they would all shoot dead corpses too while looking you right in the eyes
[2:29:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @The_Bravest_Coward they were being shitheads before the aliens

[2:35:03] <+ghostfaceninja_> ill never forget installing this demo one every computer in the my junior high's computer lab and literally everyone playing this the whole period
[2:35:04] <dabeaminator> @LiquidDinosaur They totally are a member of the Covenant. They're just granted a degree of autonomy.
[2:35:05] <%Blazymaniac> omg i just remembered the wacky limo warthog mod
[2:35:05] <Dakuu75> what the flying-fuck was that
[2:35:06] <%dinnydanny777> It looks better in Classic
[2:35:07] <$QueequegTheater> @christopherwpoindexter It's not that hard. It's tough but far from impossible
[2:35:10] <+thecraye> i mean, i'm with this, but what the fuck
[2:35:11] <floralkami> @freeborg23 no. most of these games, Woolie is new to it
[2:35:18] <Sauceboss15> I love halo CE's open levels
[2:35:24] <+Zeplin666> haha warhog go brrrr
[2:35:30] <%christopherwpoindexter> also how is that not the slogan of like a FedEx or pizza place, product tie-in with Halo @queequegtheater good to know LUL
[2:35:34] <%dinnydanny777> ...People are talking about deep lore in Woolie's first play through when he's on like the 3rd level...
[2:35:36] <+Metatermin8r> This level had about 100 different versions, there was some form of it in every version of the original Halo Bungie made. RTS, 3rd person shooter, and then finally FPS.
[2:35:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dabeaminator oh did they change/add to the lore? As i remember it, its sort of "actually conquering them would be too annoying but they're still willing to fight for us to eh"
[2:35:45] <Sauceboss15> @Zeplin666 nooooooo yuo cant just sit and spam warthog turret

[2:37:48] <+How2BEpic> Yeah. Glass is just a suggestion in this game.
[2:37:49] <SableS139a> GO FOR IT
[2:37:49] <$QueequegTheater> Maybe
[2:37:49] <dabeaminator> Speedrun tech
[2:37:49] <%raven_frame> A future cur scene is going to be super silly.
[2:37:50] <Ynkubus_> it doesnt matter, just he might not show up later
[2:37:51] <penitentpentwitch> Bug? Feature!
[2:37:52] <%2hutown> The hell??? Hahaha

[2:38:01] <SableS139a> aww
[2:38:04] <%Space_Pagan> Big skips
[2:38:07] <+Metatermin8r> Yeah, that sword elite doesn't show up again. A different one shows up at the end of the mission.
[2:38:12] <Nomad94> Oh right, you can bug through anyway

[2:38:23] <Dakuu75> co-op speedrun strats
[2:38:24] <+turolord> the elite comes back no mater if you kill him with the glitch
[2:38:24] <%christopherwpoindexter> "I play the fucking video games." - Woolie Madden, 2020.
[2:38:25] <BinaryBetrayer> Time to QA the fuck out of this bitch
[2:38:28] <dabeaminator> I bet money that speedrunners call that "Hog Skip" or something.
[2:38:28] <+How2BEpic> Halo is so good.
[2:38:34] <%dinnydanny777> We need to find L O R E
[2:38:37] <%Gruhunchously> Mr. Marine was just chilling in the Warthog

[2:38:42] <+MeMillionthDollar> SWEET SECRETS
[2:38:42] <%raven_frame> You can launch yourself through the door with the warthog before it closes.
[2:38:43] <Dakuu75> wtf is happening with the screen, is keep flickering, right?
[2:38:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> shortcut
[2:38:43] <%Lightwolfe> UMI DAAA
[2:38:48] <OperatorJo_> I miss when Halo was good dammit
[2:38:51] <%dinnydanny777> Halo is about woolieLORE
[2:38:53] <%christopherwpoindexter> wait, so you can skip that door like a friggin' token speedrunner would? LUL
[2:38:53] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Unfortunately they are spoilers
[2:38:54] <%RyTYoung> deh halo
[2:38:55] <%prime_name> Love the environments in these games.
[2:38:56] <%Javaa01> Well, about that
[2:38:58] <usurper_sos> Halo island
[2:39:01] <%subjectg> the skull in this level takes some high iq
[2:39:01] <$agoaj> This being the demo level was perfect
[2:39:05] <$QueequegTheater> @Gruhunchously I mean, would you want to get in the way of TWO Master Chiefs?
[2:39:06] <+PhantomMiG> They are playing this game lighting fast
[2:39:08] <%RyTYoung> mash dem grunts
[2:39:11] <%Pinkiefan> They should just get to the point where they get back to the open door, then restart and do the warthog door skip.
[2:39:13] <DigitalJoshie> an resort on a halo ring would be nice
[2:39:15] <Nomad94> @subjectg I don't remember, where is that?
[2:39:16] <%christopherwpoindexter> @usurper_sos but not shaped like a halo woolieSMUG
[2:39:16] <%Asuterisuku> There's multiple skulls in this level.
[2:39:17] <Goraka91> Oh we doing Halo now? PogChamp
[2:39:21] <+turolord> QA glitch you can angle your assault rifle into a dead grunt and the ricochet will kill you.
[2:39:28] <%raven_frame> It's a quick paced game with great replay value.
[2:39:28] <%brachydios777> I’d love to vacation on a Halo right
[2:39:28] <derap41> Race warthog!
[2:39:30] <%Gruhunchously> Welcome back to Telos
[2:39:30] <%christopherwpoindexter> at least the island isn't
[2:39:31] <BinaryBetrayer> Flip that Warthog
[2:39:31] <Nomad94> it's been too long
[2:39:33] <%ChoculaUltra> rip the boys
[2:39:34] <Bennett_Fracture> I'll pay you 50$ if you play halo online woolie...
[2:39:34] <BinaryBetrayer> And race it!

[2:39:46] <XxCGxOblivionxX> its time
[2:39:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> ahahhah its hunter time
[2:39:49] <%subjectg> @asuterisuku i’m thinking of the rocket jump one
[2:39:52] <+How2BEpic> Super glad V is here for Woolie's playthrough.
[2:39:53] <%dinnydanny777> Dude you can pick up every gun in the game
[2:39:55] <Nomad94> Halo 1 Pistol is the most powerful weapon in the univers
[2:39:57] <%2hutown> Man, halo holds up so well, especially for co-op. I feel like there aren't many similar ones nowadays
[2:39:57] <%Asuterisuku> I figured as much.
[2:39:57] <Nomad94> e
[2:39:58] <carrionfood> Warthog jump!
[2:39:59] <%dinnydanny777> Every gun can be used
[2:40:02] <%christopherwpoindexter> @how2bepic ME TOO
[2:40:03] <Arweynn> R.I.P. & T.E.A.R.
[2:40:07] <$QueequegTheater> whiff punish
[2:40:08] <%raven_frame> Man the pistol is gonna suck in the next game.
[2:40:15] <Nomad94> @dinnydanny777 Swords can't.
[2:40:23] <Nomad94> those aren't guns, but still
[2:40:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:40:25] <%Gruhunchously> HE'S UNSTOPPABLE
[2:40:25] <%RyTYoung> Are Woolie and V co-oping?
[2:40:28] <%dinnydanny777> @nomad94 Then I don't count them
[2:40:28] <+SilverDevilfish> double whiff
[2:40:29] <XxCGxOblivionxX> yeah, if you like this game's pistol I have some bad news for ya Woolie
[2:40:30] <%ChoculaUltra> yes
[2:40:31] <HyperBomb21> Until it is is done!
[2:40:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> OH so I wasn't crazy for rocking the pistol for forever in this game
[2:40:31] <$QueequegTheater> 6-3
[2:40:33] <Nomad94> and Fuel Rod cannons
[2:40:34] <Sauceboss15> 1st detah baby
[2:40:38] <biomegabear> @raven_frame Pistl kept getting worse despite claiming it would get stronger
[2:40:39] <Griffin1171> YMS audio scream
[2:40:40] <%brachydios777> @raven_frame It was good in the last game so IDK
[2:40:42] <%christopherwpoindexter> @rytyoung yee
[2:40:43] <%Asuterisuku> 7-5
[2:40:43] <%raven_frame> The grunts are speaking in plain english man.
[2:40:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> didnt they nerf the pistol because the BR is supposed to fill in for it
[2:40:44] <+Freeborg1997> Weird
[2:40:45] <%christopherwpoindexter> *yes
[2:40:47] <OverlordLuna> LUL
[2:40:48] <andrei11dr> 7-5
[2:40:50] <Sauceboss15> cortona translates as they speak
[2:40:51] <+Freeborg1997> Where'd they learn English
[2:40:51] <%RyTYoung> @christopherwpoindexter niice
[2:40:56] <%Asuterisuku> Also, they're speaking their own language, but Cortana is translating them to English.
[2:40:58] <phantalime> V are you gonna climb on top of the island??
[2:41:00] <+JohnRSoviet> I believe that's justified by cortana doing live translations for you
[2:41:05] <+MeMillionthDollar> LP SAVED
[2:41:08] <+Walopoh> Fun fact: there's no good lore explanation for why they speak English
[2:41:09] <%superc37> english is also the language of the prophets.
[2:41:12] <%raven_frame> I love the ODST pistol.
[2:41:13] <usurper_sos> You have a shitload
[2:41:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> More than enough
[2:41:16] <Nomad94> @Freeborg23 They didn't. our guys have translators for basically anything except Elite language
[2:41:17] <%subjectg> it’s great how almost all of woolie’s deaths have been to chain reactions
[2:41:22] <dabeaminator> @WoolieVersus It's Star Trek style instant translator tech
[2:41:23] <StuffHunter> The lore explanation is that their language is easier to translate and the tech is still working on the other races' languages.
[2:41:24] <hattrick61> 100 BOOLETS
[2:41:24] <%christopherwpoindexter> CORPSE nothing amirite
[2:41:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Walopoh they have translator tech in the books
[2:41:25] <Nomad94> @Walopoh Except what I just said
[2:41:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[2:41:29] <OperatorJo_> They speak their own language but the UNSC and ONI have translators
[2:41:32] <%Javaa01> Ammo is easy to find for the pistol, pistols are hard to find
[2:41:35] <%christopherwpoindexter> @woolieversus corpse (nothing)
[2:41:35] <%raven_frame> The grunts speak English because they're language nerds.
[2:41:37] <Goraka91> Does that thing look stealth killable?
[2:41:38] <+ghostfaceninja_> I remember being super curious about the Covenent and their culture and motivations when playing through this on launch
[2:41:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> THE MIDRIFF
[2:41:39] <iamtheTwitchghost> HE DID IT
[2:41:41] <Predatorhahaha23000> the reason they speak english is cause forerunner stuff, literally forerunner nut stuff.
[2:41:41] <ULTRA__64> One n done
[2:41:43] <$QueequegTheater> @Walopoh Yes there is, Cortana translates
[2:41:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Right in the kidney
[2:41:48] <Solidnick18> that's nuts
[2:41:48] <%ChoculaUltra> Grunts learned english from an old tv drama broadcasts called Single Female Lawyer Kappa
[2:41:49] <+Freeborg1997> @LiquidDinosaur Hot
[2:41:54] <%brachydios777> LUL
[2:41:55] <+ghostfaceninja_> part 2 did not dissapoint

[2:42:51] <%Javaa01> There is no visual indicator, use your eyes since you have a pair
[2:42:51] <%dinnydanny777> Now the score's 7-5! If Woolie wins he gets to name the raft!
[2:42:52] <Kain5707> is this on normal or heroic?
[2:42:52] <%christopherwpoindexter> fun fact I found out before I saw it online; use an extra overshield to fall off that cliff after you get the cartographer, and you'll survive
[2:42:53] <+D00msDayDan> is it a spider?
[2:42:54] <Goraka91> Prestoya! Magazine!

[2:43:09] <XxCGxOblivionxX> Dude, where's my corpse?
[2:43:09] <%Jerimoi> glad they went with a coop run of the game, i feel like its one of the best way to play it

[2:43:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> so is Player 2 just Linda?
[2:43:25] <%dinnydanny777> I think this area actually looks better in Classic

[2:43:33] <%christopherwpoindexter> corpse (nothing)
[2:43:38] <Halospaz117> I just realized, has Woolie teabagged anyone yet? Has he been properly jumped in?
[2:43:40] <dabeaminator> Thanks for the PrideStrong @gogogolem
[2:43:45] <+D00msDayDan> @LiquidDinosaur nope, linda chills in a cryo pod until first strike
[2:43:47] <PlasticJake> realizing Halo 1 really isn't that long; you guys gonna power through it?
[2:43:48] <JetpackMcQuack> John Halo's stand in another John Halo
[2:43:49] <+Quasimofo> Ayy, so happy to have V back for another playthrough
[2:43:56] <JayEarly> pistol + plasma pistol is all you need
[2:43:59] <%JD_Lars> If they were on LASSO I don’t think they would have cleared a chapter yet. Glad V convinced Woolie to start with a crawl instead of a full sprint
[2:44:02] <%dinnydanny777> Next time V dies Woolie should teabag him for the Halo Experience
[2:44:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> Fair enough, her lung got rekt
[2:44:04] <%xyxlzyzm> >reloads clip >doesn't chamber a round
[2:44:10] <PlasticJake> FLIP THE HOG
[2:44:11] <%christopherwpoindexter> @dinnydanny777 i second this motion
[2:44:15] <%RioGascar> They’ll be done with halo 1 in 3 sessions i beg
[2:44:16] <%Asuterisuku> Those will be handy when trying to get the skull.
[2:44:17] <dabeaminator> Master Chief's Stand is [Finish the Fight]
[2:44:21] <Halospaz117> @dinnydanny777 Or even better, next time Woolie dies he teabags his own corpse
[2:44:23] <%RioGascar> and maybe then on to halo 2
[2:44:25] <$QueequegTheater> YOU ARE THE WEAPON
[2:44:26] <+mckraven> sometimes you can just play the game
[2:44:32] <derap41> You are the weapon
[2:44:33] <%christopherwpoindexter> @riogascar unless they do higher difficulties
[2:44:34] <%dinnydanny777> Shoot the enemy, pick up gun

[2:44:43] <+SilverDevilfish> The myth music secret
[2:44:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's just a great sandbox
[2:44:51] <+Metatermin8r> Thats objectively incorrect, very few secrets were added in the remaster.
[2:44:51] <Nomad94> it's just not the same without Grunt Birthday Party
[2:44:53] <%chll0ne> cmonBruh
[2:44:53] <%raven_frame> There are some sick Easter eggs.
[2:44:53] <drewslo> grunts are basically just walking ammo packs
[2:44:54] <%Asuterisuku> I've got to head out to work.
[2:44:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> CHEEVO

[2:45:10] <%dinnydanny777> Stop talking about spoilers, yikes
[2:45:14] <%RioGascar> i would say dont bother scrapping because boy oh boy the levels in this are not worth scrapping
[2:45:16] <usurper_sos> Not going after skulls, eh?

[2:46:13] <Predatorhahaha23000> i think thats what me and my friend did
[2:46:13] <+HotBloodedHero> too late

[2:46:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> \LUL
[2:46:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> bye pistol
[2:46:22] <Mr_Taters > Some skulls prerequisites are nutty, they're great
[2:46:25] <%RioGascar> YOU CAN JUST HEAD STAND JUMP
[2:46:26] <%Asuterisuku> And now you have no weapons.
[2:46:26] <%christopherwpoindexter> oh my god no wonder i didn't find a single skull playing by myself
[2:46:26] <%subjectg> it’s also much easier with a rocket jump
[2:46:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheShisno i dont think there were skulls till Halo 2
[2:46:29] <andrei11dr> 8-7
[2:46:30] <usurper_sos> You can double grenade jump as well
[2:46:32] <$QueequegTheater> oh god
[2:46:33] <XxCGxOblivionxX> Halo 1 had no skulls originally, they were added in CEA
[2:46:34] <%dinnydanny777> How did someone build this place anyway it's so deep
[2:46:35] <$QueequegTheater> JESUS
[2:46:35] <floralkami> the score is still 5-7, guys
[2:46:36] <%Asuterisuku> And yeah, you can boost since you have two players.
[2:46:39] <+Metatermin8r> @TheShisno All of the skulls were added after by Saber with the remaster\
[2:46:39] <Solidnick18> he's fine
[2:46:40] <%dinnydanny777> He has a sick design
[2:46:40] <$QueequegTheater> HE HAS RISEN
[2:46:42] <%Gruhunchously> He respawned
[2:46:42] <karl_rex> Headstand jump
[2:46:43] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[2:46:43] <+ghostfaceninja_> SHUT UP
[2:46:44] <%AlphaTauri> his gear was on the ground
[2:46:44] <biomegabear> Im not the biggest fan of grenade jumping
[2:46:44] <Griffin1171> Reach design
[2:46:44] <prince_johnny_> hahaha
[2:46:45] <%dinnydanny777> What a sick design
[2:46:45] <ULTRA__64> Resurrection
[2:46:46] <Solidnick18> just sleeping
[2:46:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> But his grenades ARE STILL THERE
[2:46:47] <niddron> I LIVED BITCH
[2:46:47] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[2:46:50] <Nomad94> headstand jump tho
[2:46:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> i dont like the reach elites
[2:46:51] <bleugh> he faked it
[2:46:52] <JetpackMcQuack> jk
[2:46:52] <usurper_sos> Jesus Elite BlessRNG
[2:46:53] <dabeaminator> I prefer the original Elite design
[2:46:53] <+TheShisno> @liquiddinosaur Nah I just mean a skull original to CEA
[2:46:55] <Predatorhahaha23000> @dinnydanny777 forerunners got op primoedial tech
[2:46:55] <Flarepulse> I hope he does the jump
[2:46:57] <Goraka91> In retrospect some of the dumb things in Destiny are like the Skulls huh
[2:47:03] <%kinetikpaws> legendary elite
[2:47:06] <%christopherwpoindexter> NEW ONE
[2:47:14] <%Asuterisuku> Crouch jump, Woolie.
[2:47:16] <+ghostfaceninja_> they're clearly not glancing at chat very much
[2:47:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Bungie loves hiding stuff in random stuff. Probably always will.
[2:47:23] <dankvonmemelord> then have V run forward and wollie jump off
[2:47:29] <%brachydios777> I liked most of the Reach Elites
[2:47:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1275210654773915649?s=20
[2:47:31] <%RioGascar> He can jump with you on top and then you jump off him
[2:47:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> should i play Destiny JUST for the campaign then never again?
[2:47:35] <%Javaa01> You can totally make it with a crouch jump if you have the other player boosting you
[2:47:37] <%christopherwpoindexter> @ghostfaceninja_ facts they don't want you to know
[2:47:44] <%ChoculaUltra> fun fact, they even put the Grunt Birthday party effects into the Last Wish raid if you use the right game genie wish code.
[2:47:45] <+How2BEpic> It's also possible to wedge a warthog into there to make it a little easier. Also don't.
[2:47:47] <%RioGascar> But eh its a skull not that important
[2:47:54] <Predatorhahaha23000> elite cloaking is the only balanced cloaking.
[2:47:55] <%superc37> @liquiddinosaur no cuz the campaign isnt even that good.
[2:47:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Check OG cloaks
[2:47:59] <+Metatermin8r> @LiquidDinosaur D1? Yeah, its a solid package now that its all said and done. D2? Lol no.
[2:48:00] <Predatorhahaha23000> and real cloak
[2:48:01] <+mechslayer71> @brachydios777 Remember that one bitch who you chase down in the mission where you and Kayla crash during the assault?
[2:48:05] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur Destiny is for multiplayer mostly
[2:48:10] <%Gruhunchously> Cloaks in most games are usually very conspicuous
[2:48:11] <%dinnydanny777> Well they're Elites what did you expect
[2:48:13] <+mechslayer71> @brachydios777 real fun
[2:48:14] <Goraka91> @LiquidDinosaur The lore is nutty but it's not in the game LUL Best thing about it is the skyboxes, like no joke
[2:48:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> like, i m not gonna lie i like the aesthetic destiny has
[2:48:15] <dabeaminator> Halo 2 Anniversary was much more faithful to the original aesthetic.
[2:48:24] <Explodincatz> this normal mode?
[2:48:29] <PlasticJake> time for the SPNKR
[2:48:30] <XxCGxOblivionxX> yeah, H2A is a better remaster

[2:50:19] <+Pequod1> ugh, Halo stopped at 3
[2:50:20] <%dinnydanny777> Less ammo is a problem in Halo
[2:50:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 4,BILLION GRUNTS DEAD
[2:50:25] <dabeaminator> Halo 4 ruined Elite designs, 5 just made it even worse
[2:50:28] <Griffin1171> Learn how to aim

[2:50:34] <derap41> Legendary all skulls is just not fun
[2:50:35] <Predatorhahaha23000> @pequod1 *4*ftfy
[2:50:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> Heroic is "intended"
[2:50:37] <%subjectg> Legendary is rough
[2:50:43] <dabeaminator> Heroic is the best
[2:50:47] <Louie_Salmon> Legendary all skulls is exclusively fuckery and cheese
[2:50:47] <Goraka91> Also the Vex, Vex are cool right?
[2:50:48] <%RioGascar> Legendary is pretty damn fun but im crazh
[2:50:48] <Nomad94> Legendary is fun in coop
[2:50:48] <Catpurrple> And the grunt designs. God, they just had to keep their cute dumb little gasmasks, why did they make them so fucking gross.
[2:50:50] <+Pequod1> nah I'm with @dabeaminator
[2:50:52] <%raven_frame> Elites are your Vergils.
[2:50:54] <+MaddyCaddy> You really have to cheese Legendary
[2:50:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> Legendary you need to take potshots like its Gears its dumb
[2:50:56] <%subjectg> but i feel that heroic is too easy now
[2:51:03] <+SilverDevilfish> Legendary is one player plays the game the other works as a respawn point Kappa
[2:51:03] <MagnusCoolman> a game full of Vergils Woolie
[2:51:06] <sniffy77> legendary is plasma pistol+pistol. u dont use anything else
[2:51:07] <%dinnydanny777> Elite's are Marauders
[2:51:08] <MagnusCoolman> A GAME FULL OF VERGILS
[2:51:09] <+MaddyCaddy> It is not fun
[2:51:16] <+TheShisno> Legendary is a test
[2:51:16] <%dinnydanny777> Elite's are just Marauders
[2:51:19] <DinoBear_7> Legendary is fun depending on the game
[2:51:19] <%raven_frame> Legendary is super fun if you know what you're doing.
[2:51:19] <usurper_sos> Health becomes very important on Legendary
[2:51:21] <bearwagon> legendary is fun in groups UNLESS its HALO 2
[2:51:23] <CurrySauseBandit> Legendary is fun, depends on the person.
[2:51:25] <BinaryShuffle> The snipers on legendary monkaS
[2:51:29] <dabeaminator> Heroic is the best, Legendary is an extra challenge
[2:51:29] <%dinnydanny777> Legendary is bragging rights
[2:51:30] <+TheShisno> Heroic is the ceiling for fun
[2:51:31] <%Ancopro> legendary is fun co op cause you can abuse respawn
[2:51:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> @sniffy77 thank u, I need that
[2:51:31] <%Javaa01> Legendary is unbalanced
[2:51:32] <Goraka91> Jackals monkaS
[2:51:33] <+Pequod1> Legendary becomes fun in an exercise of frustration and futility
[2:51:33] <biomegabear> Its dante must die
[2:51:35] <Predatorhahaha23000> @metatermin8r i stopped at 4 cause i feel that 4 besides its flaws is still somewhat halo in spirit but it deserved more time in writing.
[2:51:37] <%dinnydanny777> The Legendary is bragging rights
[2:51:37] <XxCGxOblivionxX> Outskirts flashbacks
[2:51:38] <%Asuterisuku> Legendary is like DOOM's Nightmare.
[2:51:40] <ALvl78Zapdos> Halo 2 legendary is a different animal
[2:51:40] <%raven_frame> Halo 2 Legendary is just bad though.
[2:51:41] <sniffy77> Halo 2 legendary is bullshit
[2:51:42] <DinoBear_7> 2 is the game where Legendary is broken

[2:52:08] <torres_kun> Halo Legendary is fun by yourself tho...
[2:52:11] <andrei11dr> Legendary is feels like one of those hard modes that didn't get the proper testing
[2:52:12] <%christopherwpoindexter> but legendary actually has unlocks and achievements so I actually want to do it woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[2:52:13] <+Bowernator> Legendary is a very intense fun but frustrating challenge. I recently got to the last level on the OG PC version.
[2:52:16] <slatersev> Halo 2 Legendary is NOT fine
[2:52:21] <%Javaa01> Regular Nightmare
[2:52:21] <slatersev> it is busted as fuck

[2:52:28] <DesertPenguin> uh oh
[2:52:31] <%ChoculaUltra> I thought Reach legendary was fun with friends.
[2:52:31] <biomegabear> @slatersev YEAH ITS SUPER NOT
[2:52:32] <%Pinkiefan> As someone who did mythich solo on HL2 for fun, I do not represent the majority. I think Legendary is fun, unless it's HL2 coop.
[2:52:33] <puluxor> I'm glad someone is honest about Legendary Halo not being actually fun
[2:52:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @DesertPenguin
[2:52:44] <Predatorhahaha23000> rip and tear!
[2:52:45] <%dinnydanny777> Just run them over
[2:52:45] <DinoBear_7> Legendary is perfectly fine in CE, 3, and Reach. Halo 2 is the broken shit one.
[2:52:46] <%Asuterisuku> I would love to watch more of this but I think I have to wait for the anime for the rest of this level.
[2:52:49] <+TheShisno> Good ol' 50/50 Jackal Snipers

[2:53:02] <huskarl_zap> more liek master queef am I right?
[2:53:08] <slatersev> Halo 2 was mega rushed and the result is 2 wasnt play tested on its difficulties
[2:53:10] <%christopherwpoindexter> @asuterisuku 👋🏻
[2:53:12] <+zooeymainbtw> Do they have a two monitor setup going rn?
[2:53:17] <%ChoculaUltra> yes
[2:53:19] <Predatorhahaha23000> @liquiddinosaur oh yea, i noticed that cause of the core being a gooey bhole
[2:53:20] <torres_kun> All Halo Legendary is fun, but I’ll speak for mostly everyone that Halo 2’s Legendary is not very fun. For me it was
[2:53:23] <drewslo> I love how human vehicles are immortal in halo 1
[2:53:25] <dabeaminator> H2 on Heroic is still good
[2:53:25] <+mechslayer71> Yep @zooeymainbtw
[2:53:27] <+Pequod1> @slatersev remember brutes??
[2:53:27] <%Blazymaniac> yea V is on his own screen
[2:53:32] <Nomad94> @slatersev not true. Halo 2 was designed to be an asshole to you on legendary
[2:53:32] <%christopherwpoindexter> @dinobear_7 thanks for the heads up
[2:53:41] <%dinnydanny777> You can use Hunter guns in Reach
[2:53:47] <Xiangchang> Halo 2's will break people.
[2:53:48] <%raven_frame> The difficulty settings change enemy types, positions and behaviors.
[2:53:53] <VestigeOuroboros> Halo 2 legendary gives people chest hair. Including women.
[2:53:54] <dabeaminator> Man, being around people who understand and enjoy Halo is super nice. This is a good time,.
[2:53:56] <slatersev> 2 wasnt play tested
[2:53:59] <%ChoculaUltra> were spike grenades h2 or h3?
[2:53:59] <+Pequod1> @dinnydanny777 technically in this game as well
[2:54:08] <drewslo> halo 2 co-op legendary is iron skull by default
[2:54:10] <+TheShisno> The fact there's a Halo 2 speedrun achievement for a total time of 2 hours or less is the shittiest thing to put in front of another human being

[2:55:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Carpe_Deez_Nuts
[2:55:36] <derap41> The halo is like 100 km deep
[2:55:41] <Sauceboss15> the architecture of the forerunners from the bungie days is so awesome
[2:55:41] <+TheShisno> I think about girth quite often
[2:55:42] <+Kindan55> The updated graphics just make some levels too bright.
[2:55:44] <Predatorhahaha23000> the one below or 2 below them has a smooth antannaeless helm
[2:55:46] <huskarl_zap> kill moo bof

[2:56:23] <%superc37> It is a planet shaped like a ring.
[2:56:24] <%brachydios777> Pretty thicc
[2:56:25] <%raven_frame> What are the mysteries of the Ring?
[2:56:26] <+D00msDayDan> there are things about halo that even the heirarchs do not understand
[2:56:27] <+Pequod1> Any Larry Niven fans in the chat? OG ringworld stans
[2:56:29] <Predatorhahaha23000> the halo is both a space zoo and also a space fuck you nuke
[2:56:30] <dabeaminator> @penitentpentwitch Heroic even
[2:56:30] <%stemlo_> @dinnydanny777 That is a literally what they are, yes
[2:56:45] <cowardman93> @WoolieVersus the Halo ring is 22KM thick
[2:56:45] <scallycap> 22.3-47 km thicc
[2:56:46] <Ynkubus_> the inner surface is just a pretty garden slapped on top the megastructure
[2:56:46] <%stemlo_> nothing "basically just"
[2:56:47] <MasterMushin> @Pequod1 I am! I love ringworld
[2:56:47] <sniffy77> This is actually the second Installation 04 that was made. The first was a part of the original 12 Halo array.
[2:56:48] <%stemlo_> about it

[2:57:21] <%Javaa01> One of the few places in this half of the mission where you can get a pistol
[2:57:22] <%dinnydanny777> Well yeah but on a ring planet it's have to have more depth
[2:57:23] <Predatorhahaha23000> it is still stealth if no-one is around to detect you

[2:57:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pequod1 oh god i still vividly remember the first time i played Halo CE when i rented it, i was like 8 or 7, and i got fucking lost in the rockslide on level 2
[2:57:49] <slatersev> and the one in Wars 2 is the 4th
[2:57:50] <slatersev> lol
[2:57:54] <%raven_frame> Believe it or not Chief can be a stealth man like Snake. Just not as good.
[2:57:59] <%dinnydanny777> This music feels kind of sus doesn't it

[2:58:07] <iamtheTwitchghost> rip that guy
[2:58:08] <+ghostfaceninja_> isn't it revealed later that there's dozens of halos?
[2:58:08] <SixthSun2> YEETED
[2:58:08] <sniffy77> There was the first 12. Then Medicant Bias went a little insane and 11 of them died. Then 6 more were made to join Zeta Halo, making the 7 Halo Array.
[2:58:10] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:58:11] <Ynkubus_> halo 2 drone croch punch regret run is the best

[2:58:14] <%christopherwpoindexter> honestly, i don't know about y'all, but unless the game gives me badges, unlocks, achievements, or shows off my difficulty settings for me, I always pick easiest otherwise. so I'm ready to be annoyed at Legendary runs in these games woolieCHAN woolieDATTEBAYO

[2:58:22] <penitentpentwitch> Mira, what was your plan?
[2:58:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @raven_frame he was mainly a stealthboy until he got his power armor
[2:58:23] <$QueequegTheater> Fuck that guy in particular
[2:58:24] <BlackermanZX> the problem solver
[2:58:28] <Predatorhahaha23000> @raven_frame actually book chief is even BETTER than snake
[2:58:30] <Solidnick18> forhammer
[2:58:33] <asurite_warrior> V hanging out more often?
[2:58:37] <slatersev> Foehammer has the voice of a lovely aunt

[2:58:41] <sniffy77> Reminder that Master Builder Faber of Might and Will did everything wrong.
[2:58:44] <ghostspartan80> can't wait till they reach the library
[2:58:57] <%raven_frame> Foehammer is cool Boomer aunt.
[2:58:58] <+TheShisno> Faber ruined everything for everyone
[2:59:01] <%subjectg> Consider that chief can be a stealthy boi while in 1 ton armor
[2:59:03] <+Pequod1> Also I think this level starts the trend of "go across it, then backtrack back across it again:
[2:59:06] <%christopherwpoindexter> @asurite_warrior i'm looking forward to and enjoying this woolieGASM

[2:59:35] <%christopherwpoindexter> @raven_frame LUL

[2:59:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pequod1 who is the better chauffer, pequod or foehammer
[2:59:43] <sniffy77> He ran a shitty Flood decleansing operation that caused multiple ships to suddenly break out into flood infestations.
[2:59:43] <StarlitStunner> Stealth Power Armor
[2:59:45] <+mechslayer71> @torres_kun ce
[2:59:47] <%ChoculaUltra> didn't even know grunts had neutral game like that
[2:59:48] <torres_kun> Ok, thanks for the answers guy
[2:59:48] <+ghostfaceninja_> god I hope they play 2
[2:59:50] <torres_kun> Guys*
[2:59:55] <Predatorhahaha23000> just want to remind everyone that the suits are basically skintight super mechs meant for only spartan 2's and if a normal person went in they would literally die from their bones getting dusted.
[3:00:05] <slatersev> Faber handled the Flood like Florida is handling Covid
[3:00:05] <+Pequod1> @LiquidDinosaur I feel like foehammer wouldn't stop landing for D-horse
[3:00:06] <dabeaminator> I personally like to start with Reach, but I get wanting to do release order.
[3:00:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @sniffy77 topical......
[3:00:08] <biomegabear> Which halo OST had a live ochestra to compose their music?
[3:00:12] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> halo PogChamp
[3:00:20] <%christopherwpoindexter> @predatorhahaha23000 o rly 😳 woolieDATTEBAYO woolieLORE
[3:00:29] <sniffy77> Also the Librarian techically fucked a 12 year old and cucked the Ur-Didact from Halo 4 but that really isn't talked about that much
[3:00:36] <+TheShisno> And the suits have anchor points that transfer weight all the way down to the boots
[3:00:38] <penitentpentwitch> Okay, who does Woolie stream FEAR with?
[3:00:38] <stainingspade0> @predatorhahaha23000 yeah, I remember that scene in the novel
[3:00:39] <BurdRightsActivist> anniversary graphics ResidentSleeper
[3:00:41] <%Tearonex> psaBlind
[3:00:45] <Catpurrple> Starting with CE is for the best I think, it's kinda hard to go backwards if you get super used to the new way the games play. If woolie got really used to the sprint equipment, what would he do without it?
[3:00:45] <%christopherwpoindexter> @sniffy77 HUH?!
[3:00:46] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> ResidentSleeper

[3:01:12] <%dinnydanny777> BIG SUS
[3:01:13] <torres_kun> @catpurrple yeah I agree, I’m glad they started with CE
[3:01:14] <+Metatermin8r> @sniffy77 God the Forerunner Saga was fucking trip. Those were good books.
[3:01:14] <PlasticJake> any of the story stuff after 343i took over pretty much sucks
[3:01:17] <%dinnydanny777> MUCH SUS
[3:01:21] <+D00msDayDan> those books were bad, i should reread them
[3:01:21] <dabeaminator> Yeah 343 didn't just ruin the games, they ruined the lore too.
[3:01:21] <%Gruhunchously> Forerunners were the Greek Gods, confirmed
[3:01:23] <%raven_frame> Uh oh.
[3:01:25] <penitentpentwitch> Should they break after this level?
[3:01:29] <slatersev> nah the Forerunner books were good

[3:01:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:01:32] <%dinnydanny777> Pretty SUS Planet we got here
[3:01:33] <faeron93> This is easily a two stream game
[3:01:35] <+Fenrein> The Forerunner books raised my expectations for the Didact, then 4 happened
[3:01:35] <Predatorhahaha23000> also master chief has canonically nuetered a man with a punch/kick in the nuts
[3:01:38] <+Pequod1> It's lame how much they actually explained about the forerunners
[3:01:39] <%stemlo_> @Metatermin8r Those books are when I stopped reading Halo
[3:01:43] <%doomerskeletor13> This is a pretty short game
[3:01:43] <bumpbox911> is Woolie just playing Combat Evolved? Or will he take a look at the other games?

[3:02:30] <cowardman93> they don't know where Earth are
[3:02:33] <phatmac16> YEYEYEYEYEYEY
[3:02:33] <Sauceboss15> duh duh duh DUUUHH
[3:02:33] <%lotharrio> A big piece of the lore is that the humans are trying to avoid the Covenant finding out where Earth is.
[3:02:33] <DinoBear_7> 2552
[3:02:33] <yficaptions> it absolutely sounds like bagpipes
[3:02:33] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> SourPls
[3:02:34] <slatersev> 2552
[3:02:34] <%christopherwpoindexter> LUL LUL LUL
[3:02:34] <%dinnydanny777> Humans are basically fascist scum in this universe
[3:02:34] <%Gruhunchously> Let's rock
[3:02:35] <+TheShisno> 26th century, human insurrection then the aliens arrive
[3:02:36] <Halospaz117> 2552
[3:02:36] <+D00msDayDan> not enough bagpipes in halo outside of the live action odst trailer
[3:02:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 2552
[3:02:38] <+TheShisno> 52
[3:02:41] <Halospaz117> 3 ends in 53
[3:02:42] <dabeaminator> The civilian population of Humanity didn't know about the Covenant until the fall of Reach.
[3:02:42] <%subjectg> Before the covenant, humans were basically engaged in gundam-like warring
[3:02:46] <%alpacasintophats> september of 2552
[3:02:48] <%brachydios777> 2552
[3:02:49] <+kapcommunist> SourPls
[3:02:51] <slatersev> thats not true
[3:02:52] <%doomerskeletor13> They explicitly haven’t fought in Earth Space, the Covenant don’t even know where Earth is
[3:02:53] <Explodincatz> we did it
[3:02:54] <slatersev> they knew
[3:02:56] <ColbyBryant> at what cost tho?
[3:02:58] <+Pequod1> Haha we made it to be space fascism in 2500?
[3:02:59] <usurper_sos> We made it!
[3:02:59] <%subjectg> innies are basically zeon when you think about it
[3:03:00] <+TheShisno> A timeline where we had respectable and smart leaders
[3:03:01] <slatersev> they just didnt know how bad it was
[3:03:01] <%dinnydanny777> We made it, now we abduct children and live in a fascist society
[3:03:01] <+Metatermin8r> @stemlo_ They're a weird read, the author is different than any other Halo has had. I'd give some of the later books a try, Troy Denning's especially are really good. He's the next best to Eric Nylund.
[3:03:01] <+ghostfaceninja_> I don't have an electric guitar emote FeelsBadMan
[3:03:02] <penitentpentwitch> All hail Space Force!
[3:03:02] <Goraka91> To beat up other humans
[3:03:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> no
[3:03:03] <OverlordLuna> SourPls
[3:03:08] <slatersev> there not sealed in the armor
[3:03:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> Its fucked up
[3:03:09] <derap41> Make them Space Marines
[3:03:10] <%superc37> DEFINITELY NOT IMMEDIATELY
[3:03:10] <@Commando_Joe> see what you don't know is that Halo is a post apocalypse story
[3:03:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> you MAY die
[3:03:11] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It's literally 40K Space Marines
[3:03:12] <Predatorhahaha23000> round up the children to put metal bones in them
[3:03:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Give them the steroids first
[3:03:14] <%GoogleyGareth> And clones the original children that are made to die young
[3:03:14] <%lotharrio> Well there's a few iterations. But someone REALLY liked Warhammer 40k
[3:03:15] <dabeaminator> They abduct them and train them for it
[3:03:16] <KingVantq> if you dont die
[3:03:17] <@Solidus_113> GENETIC FREAKS
[3:03:19] <%dinnydanny777> Also human lives are basically expendable in Halo
[3:03:20] <sniffy77> Take 6 year old, augment them at age 12, then put on mjolnir
[3:03:20] <%EldritchBee> THE SUIT JACKS YOU OFF
[3:03:22] <phantalime> master chief is actually 3 years old, hes just tall cause of the armor
[3:03:22] <usurper_sos> If you live, maybe you can get the armor
[3:03:23] <slatersev> but Spartan training is ducked
[3:03:24] <+zerosmss> metal coated skeletons too
[3:03:25] <$QueequegTheater> I'M A GENETIC FREAK
[3:03:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Fuck them kids
[3:03:26] <Sauceboss15> its way worse than you think woolie
[3:03:26] <ColbyBryant> canonically the suit also jerks them off
[3:03:26] <slatersev> yes
[3:03:27] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> ~ woolieGASM ~
[3:03:27] <+TheShisno> Abduct these 75 6-year-olds and make them unstopable
[3:03:28] <%stemlo_> @Solidus_113 THEY'RE NOT NORMAL
[3:03:29] <+Pequod1> The coolest parts of the fucked up Halo lore never get covered
[3:03:32] <Nomad94> yes
[3:03:32] <%subjectg> Reminder that Spartans were meant to be a police force for the colonies
[3:03:32] <dankvonmemelord> and the suit beats your meat for you
[3:03:33] <cheesedburgers> If this is what happens after 2020 I’m out
[3:03:33] <derap41> Pretty much all Power armor are 40K space marines
[3:03:33] <ULTRA__64> Yup. Mark 2
[3:03:33] <ghostspartan80> lets roid up these kids for the greater good
[3:03:33] <Goraka91> If the aliens hadn't shown up the Spartans would be a crime against humanity
[3:03:34] <StarlitStunner> Flashcloned copies to fool the parents
[3:03:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> 2's yeah
[3:03:35] <%christopherwpoindexter> SPEAKING OF AN OUTBREAK...wait, can't say yet
[3:03:36] <BurdRightsActivist> SPARTAN 118 - COLOSTOMY BAG
[3:03:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> They also replace you in your house with clones that immediately die and get cancer
[3:03:38] <dabeaminator> ONI is fucked man

[3:03:48] <PlasticJake> gotta give the kids BONE HURTING JUICE before putting them in the suit
[3:03:50] <slatersev> and its biblical as fuck
[3:03:52] <drewslo> basically covenant got to reach and it was so hard to beat they thought it was the home planet
[3:03:53] <+Tarheelg23> All the SPARTAN 1s died because the training was fucked up

[3:04:01] <vulkan_vibes> navy
[3:04:01] <%dinnydanny777> Eugenics huh
[3:04:02] <BurdRightsActivist> Spartan 1 was the Orion project right?
[3:04:03] <huskarl_zap> spartan 3s women desk workers can be space marines too you guys

[3:04:06] <%christopherwpoindexter> @cheesedburgers same
[3:04:07] <Goraka91> Master Chief Gunnery Sargent or some such
[3:04:07] <%ChoculaUltra> THAT AIN'T FALCO
[3:04:08] <DeathByPoke7> 117 is his last name Kappa
[3:04:09] <+A_mere_shrubb> Sierra 117
[3:04:09] <%superc37> John117
[3:04:10] <+Karkatstoaster> John 1:17
[3:04:11] <biomegabear> its nautical rank which is weird
[3:04:12] <$QueequegTheater> Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 Sierra
[3:04:14] <Magicferret> should have been 1337
[3:04:18] <+D00msDayDan> @Halospaz117 definitely captain price
[3:04:18] <%lotharrio> Jon 743 Halo
[3:04:19] <+lioan515> J O H N H A L O
[3:04:19] <Predatorhahaha23000> but then the covenant arrived and be like "check the patch bro"
[3:04:22] <%Tearonex> Spartan 1337 does exist LUL
[3:04:23] <XxCGxOblivionxX> Spartan-IIIs and onwards didn't do the fucked up child kidnapping stuff
[3:04:23] <dabeaminator> ONI is basically the CIA. Government sanctioned war crimes.
[3:04:24] <%christopherwpoindexter> ME TOO V
[3:04:27] <PlasticJake> John F. Halo,
[3:04:27] <+mechslayer71> @biomegabear He is a space marine
[3:04:28] <%stemlo_> There was also the YGGSDRASIL program
[3:04:29] <+TheShisno> Oh there is a Spartan 1337. And it is the most anime
[3:04:30] <vulkan_vibes> woolie has never savored this ost
[3:04:31] <Sauceboss15> i just realized that woolie should get all of the Christianity references from Halo
[3:04:31] <scallycap> its the African Century
[3:04:32] <The_RDDM> The DOA Spartan was 458
[3:04:35] <%dinnydanny777> Human society in Halo is basically eugenical fascism
[3:04:37] <slatersev> Spartan 3;s were war orphans
[3:04:37] <%brachydios777> @magicferret You ever seen Halo Legends?
[3:04:39] <+ghostfaceninja_> whats a djembe?
[3:04:40] <huskarl_zap> @xxcgxoblivionxx which is why they're worse
[3:04:41] <slatersev> they were very fucked
[3:04:44] <XxCGxOblivionxX> reminder that Halo Legends exists and is cool
[3:04:44] <Goraka91> I thought Halo 5 was gonna be about ONI, welp
[3:04:47] <%subjectg> @biomegabear since we’re in space that makes us technically navy
[3:04:48] <+Metatermin8r> Chief also canonnically likes being called Master Chief, and jokes about how a rank change would be awkward when Lord Hood offers him a promotion to Admiral.
[3:04:48] <biomegabear> @mechslayer71 YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH!
[3:04:48] <+EMFole> the OST has a lot of native African influences, especially in the drums and vocals
[3:04:48] <GHouseduivel> @ghostfaceninja_ African Drum
[3:04:51] <sniffy77> Reminder that part of the reason why Truth, Regret, and Mercy came into power is because the Prophet of Restraint got caught banging a girl he wasn't supposed to.
[3:04:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> Maybe not all, but many Spartans literally dont remember their last name
[3:04:52] <+cursedwithadhd> muti cultural future woolie
[3:04:54] <+TheShisno> We'll get into Spartan 3s during Reach
[3:04:56] <dabeaminator> I wish they had someone there to explain the background lore.
[3:04:57] <+Karkatstoaster> Named John 1:17. Because there weren’t enough Christianity references in halo, lol
[3:04:58] <%Gruhunchously> LUL
[3:04:59] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> CO-OP RULES
[3:05:00] <%ChoculaUltra> please tell me there canonically was a Spartan 69 or 420
[3:05:03] <Nomad94> LUL
[3:05:04] <derap41> There where TWO!
[3:05:05] <%kyh9> respawned?
[3:05:10] <GHouseduivel> @ghostfaceninja_ It's large and gets thinner as you go down
[3:05:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> Body Double Kappa
[3:05:12] <VestigeOuroboros> Doesn't most of Halo 2 happen in africa
[3:05:14] <OverlordLuna> LUL
[3:05:15] <%dinnydanny777> You dropped the Magnum
[3:05:15] <%christopherwpoindexter> @choculaultra there better be
[3:05:16] <Ynkubus_> @Goraka91 50% being their lackey tho
[3:05:17] <%kyh9> @derap41 I didn't know Axel was in this game
[3:05:17] <+Pequod1> @EMFole honestly a really cool thing about Halo was how Africa centric it was on earth too, taking place in New Mombasa
[3:05:17] <biomegabear> @subjectg YEAH SPAACE IS THE WATER!
[3:05:17] <+einherjarvalk> now there are two of them!
[3:05:18] <slatersev> the names dont go up that igh
[3:05:19] <hattrick61> there was a spartain 1337
[3:05:21] <$QueequegTheater> HAUNTED
[3:05:21] <%Gruhunchously> Ghost Recon
[3:05:22] <%lotharrio> Woolie being the Goku of this series.
[3:05:23] <dabeaminator> Halo 3 is in Africa
[3:05:24] <%Blazymaniac> he faked his death
[3:05:25] <vulkan_vibes> halo 2 is in kenya
[3:05:26] <Xiangchang> He was just sleeping, you know. Playing dead.
[3:05:26] <penitentpentwitch> Proof you can exorcise ghosts with bullets
[3:05:27] <StarlitStunner> @choculaultra Solomon is spartan 069
[3:05:27] <+shapeforn> Its Nautical ranks because hes part of the UNSC Navy, not Marines
[3:05:27] <BurdRightsActivist> RED PHANTOM ELITES
[3:05:29] <+Fenrein> On higher difficulties he tanks that rocket lol
[3:05:29] <Joestar1890> Halo's haunted
[3:05:31] <Axle13j> holy shit there's two of them
[3:05:33] <slatersev> 1337 was non canon fun joke
[3:05:34] <Nomad94> Mombasa
[3:05:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> "On closer examination, the Zealot is only PRETENDING to be dead"
[3:05:41] <+TheShisno> Halo 2's Earth sections are in New Mombasa
[3:05:41] <%ChoculaUltra> @StarlitStunner excellent
[3:05:42] <XxCGxOblivionxX> 2 and 3's Earth bits are in Africa, yeah
[3:05:42] <slatersev> the actual numbers dont go past 140
[3:05:45] <%raven_frame> There's a track named Africa.
[3:05:45] <Goraka91> @Ynkubus18 True but I meant like the villain, Hunt the Truth seemed to be going for that and then...nothing
[3:05:47] <%christopherwpoindexter> @axle13j they fly now? Kappa
[3:05:47] <%dinnydanny777> Woolie just got slapped lmao
[3:05:54] <%stemlo_> New Mumbasa
[3:05:54] <%brachydios777> Halo 2 is in New Mombossa
[3:05:57] <%dinnydanny777> You actually got slapped
[3:05:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pequod1 yeah IIRC the idea is that the firs space elevator was in Mombassa so it became the most prosperous trade hub on the planet, since everything coming to/from space was there
[3:06:00] <slatersev> so is ODST
[3:06:02] <%ChoculaUltra> ah, so 140 was like the "last" spartan in the program I'm assuming?
[3:06:04] <Axle13j> LUL
[3:06:05] <Nomad94> *Mombasa
[3:06:08] <+D00msDayDan> time for like the longest level in the game
[3:06:09] <huskarl_zap> new Kenya hay hay people

[3:06:11] <zocano> Hot damn they already at the end of Silent Cartographer
[3:06:12] <slatersev> the numbers are in order
[3:06:16] <huskarl_zap> I mean uganda
[3:06:17] <+Karkatstoaster> I gotta say I really like the sort of “interlocking metal” aesthetic of halos architecture
[3:06:19] <Ynkubus_> @Goraka91 yeah, I get you, would have been nice of it to be at least critical of them
[3:06:19] <zocano> They moving fast
[3:06:19] <%raven_frame> Does everything on Earth take place in Africa?
[3:06:20] <slatersev> arent
[3:06:24] <+D00msDayDan> @ChoculaUltra they had 150 candidates initially but only the funding to "recruit" 75
[3:06:26] <$QueequegTheater> @raven_frame yes
[3:06:27] <BurdRightsActivist> UGANDAN AIR FORCE
[3:06:28] <%superc37> probably

[3:06:33] <%Gruhunchously> Cortana why are you playing?
[3:06:35] <%dinnydanny777> We just flew through a tree
[3:06:38] <dabeaminator> I don't think his name is a Christianity reference. John 1:17 doesn't really have any connection.
[3:06:38] <+TheShisno> Yeah all the plot is in Africa for REASONS
[3:06:41] <XxCGxOblivionxX> deadly commandoes
[3:06:41] <OverlordLuna> Jebaited

[3:06:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> THE PELICAN IS TOO SMALL FOR THIS HOLE
[3:06:45] <%dinnydanny777> The Pelican just clipped through a tree
[3:06:46] <+Karkatstoaster> What verse is John 1:17 anyway
[3:06:48] <%stemlo_> @raven_frame The space elevator is in Mombassa so its the most important city ever
[3:06:49] <ULTRA__64> Airdrop from underground doodBigBrain

[3:07:07] <+ghostfaceninja_> Africa is the origin of humanity as well as the most populous continent
[3:07:08] <dabeaminator> It's about Moses bringing the law through the commandments.
[3:07:09] <%dinnydanny777> Shhhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:07:09] <XxCGxOblivionxX> @Karkatstoaster "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
[3:07:09] <%BisoromiBear> everyone in that shaft would be deaf
[3:07:10] <penitentpentwitch> Break Time?

[3:07:12] <iamtheTwitchghost> this is the other best level
[3:07:12] <derap41> Yeah this is no sarcasm an iconic level
[3:07:13] <+Kindan55> probably the best level I think
[3:07:16] <Joestar1890> Halo has some FUCKIN NICE levels
[3:07:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> @stemlo_ there's other space elevators but that is the first/most important one. There was also one in Cuba i think they blew up in one of the books

[3:07:48] <%BisoromiBear> covenant nerds
[3:07:48] <Halospaz117> They're great, aren't they?
[3:07:51] <Goraka91> Unngoy are good boys
[3:07:51] <%dinnydanny777> They're basically Alien Serfs, Woolie
[3:07:52] <Catpurrple> Grunts are so great.
[3:07:52] <Joestar1890> They're the comedic relief
[3:07:52] <penitentpentwitch> Gold Fish Poop Gang!
[3:07:52] <slatersev> my loser alien dogs
[3:07:53] <+TheShisno> The mass breeding slave fodder
[3:07:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> they breathe methane
[3:07:55] <dabeaminator> @WoolieVersus It's because they breath methane gas.
[3:07:56] <%brachydios777> Grunts are babies
[3:07:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Remember when games were FUN
[3:08:00] <+Karkatstoaster> The grunts hate it
[3:08:00] <iamtheTwitchghost> fart gas
[3:08:01] <%raven_frame> Farts.
[3:08:03] <drewslo> grunts are also like 5'8
[3:08:04] <lessclams> mmm farts
[3:08:04] <%dinnydanny777> They sniff farts
[3:08:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:08:05] <derap41> They breath fart gas
[3:08:05] <+primax104> they are the prequel droid grunts
[3:08:05] <StarlitStunner> Grunts drink milk
[3:08:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> fart gas
[3:08:06] <Goraka91> ...Oh god the Cabal are just swole Grunts
[3:08:06] <+Kindan55> They set the bar too high with H2A cutscenes.
[3:08:06] <scallycap> they LOVE farts
[3:08:07] <ghostspartan80> ah the grunt rebellion...
[3:08:08] <$QueequegTheater> BREATHE THE FART GAS WOOLiE
[3:08:09] <+Karkatstoaster> They don’t even want to fight
[3:08:11] <Predatorhahaha23000> grunts are scary tall
[3:08:11] <korth367> MMMMMMMMMMM Meeeeeee
[3:08:12] <+Afterman_> oh so they ARE pat
[3:08:13] <The_RDDM> Literally huffing their own farts
[3:08:13] <%raven_frame> Pat is a grunt.
[3:08:14] <%Javaa01> THEY BREATHE THE POOPOO
[3:08:15] <+TheShisno> Fart sniffer waddlers
[3:08:18] <%MasterTonberry23> So whos looking forward to Halo 6 Kappa
[3:08:19] <+ghostfaceninja_> I'm looking forward to Woolie's reaction to the "other" faction
[3:08:20] <%Gruhunchously> I would have thought it would be helium
[3:08:20] <%christopherwpoindexter> @choculaultra @axle13j 👏🏻👋🏻 they're like Mario goombas. also yay Bible story time 😝
[3:08:22] <Ynkubus_> @Pequod1 Locke gets in chiefs grill for a min before being put in his place, then blue team teleport away
[3:08:23] <+D00msDayDan> they breathe fart gas
[3:08:23] <BurdRightsActivist> NEIL DRUCKMAN ALIENS PogChamp
[3:08:24] <therealtacopancakes> grunts were on their iron/middle age weren't they?
[3:08:26] <VestigeOuroboros> Oh god pat IS a grunt that's depressing
[3:08:27] <Griffin1171> Jankum
[3:08:27] <iamtheTwitchghost> @raven_frame i need fan art of this right now
[3:08:27] <dabeaminator> They have spikes on their elbows for burrowing through the ice on their homeworld.
[3:08:29] <+TheShisno> They're like 5'4", right?
[3:08:29] <%brachydios777> @mastertonberry23 Crossing my fingers
[3:08:30] <%raven_frame> That must be why Pat doesn't like Halo very much.
[3:08:33] <+Kindan55> Nice, pat is finishing off Obra Dinn on stream.
[3:08:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:08:34] <derap41> Grunt aren't even meant to be soldiers they're support workes
[3:08:36] <Predatorhahaha23000> like im kinda insulted that they are so short for how tall they really are.
[3:08:36] <%stemlo_> Grunts are like 5 to 5'3. Perfectly pat sized
[3:08:44] <%raven_frame> He sees too much of himself in the grunts.
[3:08:44] <%subjectg> they’re not so fun when you realize they’re like 4-5 feet tall and are swole af
[3:08:46] <+Afterman_> what the hell was that visual change
[3:08:46] <+Pequod1> @Ynkubus18 yeah I distinctly remember a lot of running away lol
[3:08:46] <cheesedburgers> Manlet Monday
[3:08:50] <DinoBear_7> They can get bigger than Pat
[3:08:51] <%dinnydanny777> The updated designs of these areas are so weird
[3:08:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> Grunt life in the military obviously sucks but for the most part grunts really like the covenant because their homeworld is COMPLETELY FUCKING AWFUL and even being the bottom caste of the Covenant is fucking great in comparison
[3:08:52] <+burntbagels13> are they playing on easy?
[3:08:53] <+TheShisno> Well, Chief is 7'+
[3:08:56] <GoYaK> have they reached the flood yet ?
[3:08:57] <%sexdrugsvideogames> assault rifle sounds like a sledgehammer
[3:09:00] <$QueequegTheater> Like some kind of Zog Machine
[3:09:00] <%brachydios777> Normal
[3:09:01] <Predatorhahaha23000> mod to make pat a grunt and woolie an elite
[3:09:03] <%lotharrio> Zugzug
[3:09:03] <Sauceboss15> Chief is almost 8 foot
[3:09:03] <%BisoromiBear> could have WHAT now?
[3:09:05] <%dinnydanny777> Like the difference between classic and modern is bizzare
[3:09:06] <%ChoculaUltra> negative on the flood
[3:09:07] <dabeaminator> They're the same height as Pat holy shit
[3:09:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> @themaskedman4u, co op on normals so yes ... easy mode
[3:09:14] <%Gruhunchously> An army of Pats
[3:09:16] <GoYaK> ty choco
[3:09:17] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat confirmed for nipple mate
[3:09:18] <+burntbagels13> LOL
[3:09:20] <%EldritchBee> Grunts have even the worst species name, they're UNGGOY
[3:09:20] <+Karkatstoaster> Grunts don’t even want to be here. Without the Elites to scare them they’re just like “FUCK THIS LETS RUN”
[3:09:23] <%brachydios777> LUL
[3:09:24] <derap41> Sleepy
[3:09:26] <usurper_sos> Elites would look pretty cool with dreads
[3:09:29] <dankvonmemelord> check this in classic
[3:09:34] <+Karkatstoaster> The idea that the grunts could help secure anything is kinda hilarious
[3:09:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> WAIT when people talk about grunt height do they mean with the gas tank
[3:09:35] <masterfire23> when do they use the hammer of dawn .. oh wait wrong franchise
[3:09:39] <%RioGascar> Yay the winter level
[3:09:39] <$QueequegTheater> See, Johnson's alive again
[3:09:43] <Predatorhahaha23000> elites lay eggs also
[3:09:43] <Ynkubus_> @Pequod1 chief and pals were busy, dlet them get on with it Locke/ONI
[3:09:45] <OverlordLuna> our boy!
[3:09:47] <%MasterTonberry23> I remember this level, if youre lucky you can steal a banshee at one point and skip almost half the level
[3:09:48] <Griffin1171> Inclement weather
[3:09:51] <jimmytwofeet> WHICH DIFFICULTY?
[3:09:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh hey btw anyone here play Oni?
[3:09:53] <drewslo> cold weather to slow the spoilers
[3:09:53] <%subjectg> it’s so weird learning the grunts are called unggoy

[3:10:11] <Goraka91> Jackals/Kig'yar are birbs
[3:10:11] <%raven_frame> Jackals are kind of like humans in personality.
[3:10:11] <+TheShisno> Nah they birds
[3:10:12] <OverlordLuna> SourPls
[3:10:12] <dabeaminator> The Grunts breed like Tribbles, so the Covenant had to chemically castrate them against their will to keep them in line.
[3:10:13] <usurper_sos> Another Banger
[3:10:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> SourPls
[3:10:14] <%ChoculaUltra> oh yeah, Jackals totally have beaks right?

[3:10:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CursedNobleman i loved Oni but i will NEVER play it again because i just know its aged horribly
[3:10:24] <Catpurrple> Jackals are bastards, all of them.
[3:10:26] <%raven_frame> Jackals are space pirates.
[3:10:30] <+ManOfReason> LUL
[3:10:35] <OverlordLuna> LUL
[3:10:38] <Predatorhahaha23000> jackals are cool but space pirates af
[3:10:39] <%Taglog7> top or feed
[3:10:41] <dabeaminator> Jackals are cool space pirates
[3:10:41] <ZenZottle> AJAB
[3:10:42] <Goraka91> Also the Fallen are just Elites if they were Jackals
[3:10:43] <unit24> oh no is this the level that's cool until it sucks
[3:10:44] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus i caught that Mercenaries reference, V.
[3:10:46] <%ChoculaUltra> I never get to appreciate Jackals up close, you know them being utter bastards and all.
[3:10:47] <+Pequod1> bwahah
[3:10:48] <VestigeOuroboros> I completely forgot this level and realize now that it looks like narrows from halo 3.
[3:10:49] <XxCGxOblivionxX> The art for Oni was done by fuckin Guru Larry
[3:10:51] <%dinnydanny777> V kill Woolie for that
[3:10:53] <%Gruhunchously> I'll just look down like you said
[3:10:54] <%brachydios777> Jackels are natural assholes
[3:11:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> Jackals are kobolds, grunts are goblins, elites are hobgoblins, brutes are bugbears
[3:11:05] <%dinnydanny777> Woolie left you to die V, you should team kill him
[3:11:07] <derap41> Also you flew down here
[3:11:10] <ZenZottle> All Jackals are bastards
[3:11:10] <+ghostfaceninja_> Minh's gonna earn his paycheck editing this together
[3:11:12] <Raztron> Bad taste Woolie
[3:11:14] <BurdRightsActivist> Looks better in classic
[3:11:20] <%lotharrio> @LiquidDinosaur wtf I love Brutes now!
[3:11:21] <%ChoculaUltra> AJAB LUL
[3:11:21] <%dinnydanny777> What's it look like on Classic?
[3:11:27] <Predatorhahaha23000> i want woolie to experience jackal snipers on halo 2
[3:11:28] <+firmlygraspi1> Doom
[3:11:31] <+TheShisno> Way better in remastered
[3:11:31] <Raztron> Strong original Art direction is better
[3:11:33] <Arweynn> how does the sequence break work here again? early banshee or careful dropping?
[3:11:33] <%dinnydanny777> Oh wow completely different
[3:11:33] <+Pequod1> oof
[3:11:34] <%raven_frame> They weren't allowed in the Pillar of Autumn mission because the Covenant doesn't trust them to not just hijack whatever ship they're on.
[3:11:42] <alrobot2014> should also be noted that the anniversary version is based on the old gearbox port so some fx are not like on the og xbox version
[3:11:43] <XxCGxOblivionxX> the game generally looks better in Classic IMO, more cohesive artistically
[3:11:43] <StarlitStunner> @liquiddinosaur Oni was fun, Konoko is a cute girl! stripLuv
[3:11:47] <+Fenrein> Unreal maybe?
[3:11:50] <%Javaa01> Half Life locations weren't so much massive, but they flowed together damn near flawlessly
[3:11:52] <%MasterTonberry23> Halo Reach had the best campaign
[3:11:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lotharrio brutes are fine once they stop being bullet sponges with no hit-animations that just ragdoll flaccidly on death in Halo 2
[3:11:52] <Goraka91> Bungie is always great with their aesthetic
[3:11:58] <available_line> I think the best snow level is still the one in Hitman 2 Silent Assassin.
[3:12:02] <unit24> yo who's ready for over a dozen copy pasted rooms
[3:12:03] <+Pequod1> @MasterTonberry23 +1
[3:12:10] <derap41> Oh I loved stealthing these sections
[3:12:11] <+Karkatstoaster> Oh no
[3:12:13] <%RioGascar> what half life didnt have in size made up for in its design
[3:12:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Woolie plays this game like my little cousin
[3:12:21] <Raztron> Halo 3 and ODST are the best campaigns
[3:12:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> SourPls
[3:12:28] <Predatorhahaha23000> Kreygasm *halo lady vocalizing noises*
[3:12:30] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> SourPls
[3:12:30] <Explodincatz> get used to seeing these types of rooms
[3:12:30] <+Karkatstoaster> Whooo thank god. Thought the stream froze for a second
[3:12:31] <%MasterTonberry23> @unit24 Urrrgh dont remind me, and we still the Librarary later on
[3:12:32] <%RioGascar> halos 1 level design and look can...get really bad
[3:12:36] <dabeaminator> H2 has the best campaign I think
[3:12:37] <$QueequegTheater> Don't try it
[3:12:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus FUN FACT: HALO HAS ABOUT THE SURFACE AREA OF CANADA
[3:12:39] <BurdRightsActivist> IT'S OVER WOOLIE
[3:12:43] <PunkZedB> it's over master chief, I have the high ground
[3:12:44] <penitentpentwitch> He knows how Anakin feels!
[3:12:44] <%dinnydanny777> Have the high ground
[3:12:45] <Raztron> Halo 2 feels and looks so much worse with 3 available
[3:12:46] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah the interiors all sort of blend together.
[3:12:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DON'T TRY IT
[3:12:47] <XxCGxOblivionxX> It's over Woolie
[3:12:47] <OverlordLuna> Ok Woolikin
[3:12:50] <ThatGuyThere03> FROM MY PER-
[3:12:50] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> H4 is the best
[3:12:51] <%raven_frame> Woolie hates looking up, he despises the high ground.
[3:12:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> FROM MY-
[3:12:52] <usurper_sos> Don't try it
[3:12:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Pequod1
[3:12:55] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> 3* Kappa
[3:12:56] <unit24> @MasterTonberry23 people forget how padded halo 1's campaign can be
[3:12:58] <NotHereToStream> anakin had no chance
[3:12:59] <+theKingRamses> HIGHGROUND
[3:13:01] <+JohnRSoviet> obi-wan knew what he was talkin about
[3:13:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> @StarlitStunner Konoko will always be my favorite hot-blooded nominal hero who is actually a pretty shitty person
[3:13:04] <phatmac16> They have the high ground!
[3:13:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolikin Skywalker
[3:13:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> There's a Halo 3 multiplayer map called High Ground btw
[3:13:11] <%MasterTonberry23> @unit24 I didnt forget. Bleaugh
[3:13:11] <+Karkatstoaster> I’m sorry how- Where is the scope on the magnum

[3:13:21] <%lotharrio> Highground: +2 attack, +2 AC
[3:13:21] <DeathByPoke7> high ground is the name o the game in multiplayer
[3:13:23] <%dinnydanny777> In Armored Core you used to be able to jump on an enemy and shoot them to death and they couldn't deal with it
[3:13:26] <Goraka91> I mean yeah that's how old timey fights went as well, get hill > win
[3:13:26] <DesertPenguin> Apex Legends

[3:13:27] <+D00msDayDan> @Karkatstoaster built into the gun, you look through it with your helmet visor
[3:13:27] <%RioGascar> In actual combat high ground is SUPER IMPORTANT
[3:13:31] <HyperBomb21> Yep. Daggerfall had climbing
[3:13:32] <%MrMoonGoose> It was a mechanic.
[3:13:33] <+How2BEpic> climbing was in daggerfall
[3:13:34] <derap41> Hidden loadning screen
[3:13:34] <+NocturnePsycho> it was in the base game
[3:13:35] <XxCGxOblivionxX> @Karkatstoaster it's the little bump at the front
[3:13:35] <Catpurrple> Yeah, climbing was always in daggerfall

[3:27:45] <+Grayhammatter> we ain't got NO THUNDER
[3:27:46] <+Kqha4000> Halo 1 scorpion is the woorst in the franchise because you can get sniped out of it at no damage
[3:27:48] <%raven_frame> Woolie is going to love that Halo 2 bridge.
[3:27:48] <+MidnightBurst12> smack
[3:27:50] <%MasterTonberry23> I wish they brought back the armor mods from Reach, those were awesome
[3:27:57] <+Karkatstoaster> What’s everyone “...”-ing abt
[3:28:00] <thesoldierofjoy> more like Strolling Thunder
[3:28:01] <Goraka91> Where is Peter Dinklage
[3:28:05] <ZeeJiggle> That Elite was also switching between classic and remastered graphics and not paying attention
[3:28:07] <%dinnydanny777> Remember to drift Woolie
[3:28:09] <%Pyretech> wheelie button
[3:28:09] <+D00msDayDan> jump button does wheelies
[3:28:10] <drewslo> gouse hog best
[3:28:13] <dabeaminator> Left trigger is a boost
[3:28:13] <+Fenrein> The jump button does wheelies
[3:28:18] <hattrick61> Does CE have boost?
[3:28:22] <XxCGxOblivionxX> boost isn't in CE
[3:28:23] <phantalime> no boost in CE
[3:28:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> ....its immortal
[3:28:24] <+Fenrein> CE doesn't have boost
[3:28:27] <%LoganWulfric> So those bridges have a weird geometry collision that can lock objects into it, that Tank now exists on another surface
[3:28:31] <%Pyretech> you can blow them up in Halo 3-5
[3:28:31] <%Gruhunchously> CoD Ghosts
[3:28:32] <%brachydios777> Boost is later
[3:28:33] <dabeaminator> Oh really? It's been a while
[3:28:34] <%prime_name> Not in this game, at least
[3:28:35] <Catpurrple> High manuverability, very useful. No boost until 2 though, when it really comes into its own.
[3:28:36] <drewslo> splatter them
[3:28:37] <+Kindan55> Ghosts kinds blow without boost
[3:28:44] <%raven_frame> I knew he would like the Ghost.
[3:28:45] <Griffin1171> CE Ghost doesnt need boost
[3:28:51] <XxCGxOblivionxX> speeeeen
[3:28:52] <marvel877> Ghosts are also easier to get shot out of and tip over.
[3:28:55] <%dinnydanny777> Remember to run people over
[3:28:56] <skwisgaar451> never seen someone be this wrong about halo
[3:28:56] <ZeeJiggle> You got boost power!
[3:28:58] <VestigeOuroboros> After he beats this I just want cursed halo.
[3:28:58] <Goraka91> Man Destiny has some awful Ghost equivelants
[3:28:59] <centuronstar> It's kinda funny you playing this on the day that Halo Infinite starts it's marketing campaign
[3:29:01] <%dinnydanny777> Always run people over
[3:29:03] <derap41> Waah
[3:29:03] <%prime_name> It amazes me that all the really fun stuff in Halo is just one game away.
[3:29:04] <%LoganWulfric> Once managed to get a Banshee locked underneath one
[3:29:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Has Woolie brought out the Doritos and Mountain Dew yet?
[3:29:05] <StarlitStunner> Boost murders everything in 2 and 3
[3:29:07] <OverlordLuna> BOOSTO
[3:29:14] <dabeaminator> Use the boost to escape pits!
[3:29:15] <%dinnydanny777> Never not run people over
[3:29:19] <biomegabear> halo 1 ghost float a little higher than in later games
[3:29:39] <AppleBerryKitty> fun fact, if you mod to play as a elite you can get in but can't get back out
[3:29:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:29:47] <+Reaverund> Basically everything from Halo 1 gets nerfed in the later games
[3:29:49] <+gustavozxd> more little V gameplay PogChamp
[3:29:54] <+einherjarvalk> literally just touch the hunter
[3:29:56] <%MasterTonberry23> I always thought it was so weird how in 3 the chief can just punch a Wraith into scrap
[3:30:05] <%ChoculaUltra> now THIS is ghost racing
[3:30:08] <%dinnydanny777> Ghosts can do sick jumps man

[3:30:27] <hattrick61> your otger behind
[3:30:27] <+Reaverund> They nerf the crazy grenade tosses in H2 but bring them back in H3 for some reason
[3:30:29] <+Karkatstoaster> Fun fact: in Halo lore it’s stated that Master Chief isn’t actually that much better combat-wise than other Spartans, he’s just INCREDIBLY lucky
[3:30:30] <%Gruhunchously> So do enemies respawn when you die?
[3:30:31] <%RioGascar> 10-10
[3:30:47] <%RioGascar> You go back to checkpoint
[3:30:50] <%brachydios777> @gruhunchously If both yes
[3:30:50] <%MasterTonberry23> @Gruhunchously No, unless theyre Flood
[3:30:52] <%RioGascar> So...yes???
[3:30:52] <TheChucklingOak> He's also one of the most effective leaders, though he wasn't always
[3:30:55] <andrei11dr> I thought it was 9-10
[3:31:08] <%RioGascar> Oh shit thats right
[3:31:10] <%MasterTonberry23> @Gruhunchously Nevermind Im dumb
[3:31:26] <%dinnydanny777> Now the score's 9-10!
[3:31:27] <XxCGxOblivionxX> yo Marathon LP when
[3:31:30] <%LoganWulfric> Surprised V didn't bring up the obtainable Banshee in this level unless he doesn't know
[3:31:36] <+TheShisno> That was close
[3:31:39] <atlas624> @Karkatstoaster I'll take the guy who consistently rolls the hard 6 over the guy who tests well but dies first any day of the week
[3:31:41] <$QueequegTheater> That's why you don't use plasma grenades on hunters
[3:31:46] <%raven_frame> Woolie gets the shotgun next mission.
[3:31:52] <alrobot2014> the highest of grounds, the sky
[3:31:53] <%dinnydanny777> I love how the Hunters hide behind their shields

[3:32:15] <+Reaverund> @theKingRamses They disable vehicles, yes.
[3:32:18] <+Karkatstoaster> Did the Hunters ever come back? I only played Halo 2 & 4 and I don’t rember ever seeing them
[3:32:19] <%dinnydanny777> Banshee's can also run you over
[3:32:21] <%raven_frame> The shotgun is so good in this.
[3:32:21] <usurper_sos> He just fucked off
[3:32:25] <%MasterTonberry23> Anyone played the Halo arcade game? Its...not great
[3:32:27] <TheChucklingOak> Hunters are in every game
[3:32:28] <%dinnydanny777> A fun fact is that Banshee's can run you over
[3:32:36] <%dinnydanny777> Despite being planes
[3:32:49] <+Karkatstoaster> I think a plane could run me over
[3:32:53] <+Ropcord> anything that headshots technically
[3:32:56] <+ghostfaceninja_> oh hi Mark
[3:32:59] <%RioGascar> @dinnydanny777 I mean a plane can run you over. Its got wheels
[3:33:04] <$QueequegTheater> Human steel, folded over 100 times
[3:33:09] <%BisoromiBear> bullets for meat, plasma for shields
[3:33:14] <TheChucklingOak> Oh snap, is that Chips Dubbo?
[3:33:16] <+wunp_fxs> simple but effective AI
[3:33:17] <+Reaverund> @Karkatstoaster They're definitely in every game before 4. Idk about after.
[3:33:20] <Naho_Saenoki> @MasterTonberry23 Fireteam whatever? My local arcade has it. It's okay, but I'd much rather play anything else there.
[3:33:28] <%Gruhunchously> The AI in Halo is generally above average
[3:33:32] <%dinnydanny777> Most planes can't face hug the floor though
[3:33:34] <drewslo> halo 1 has shockingly good AI
[3:33:51] <%dinnydanny777> Save Australian man
[3:34:02] <+SashaStarshine> CHIPPS
[3:34:04] <%brachydios777> Halo has good AI for most of the board
[3:34:10] <+Kindan55> He's kiwi not Australian.
[3:34:12] <%subjectg> @naho_saenoki i wish they went the time crisis route with fireteam raven, it would have been cool seeing covies duck and cover
[3:34:13] <Naho_Saenoki> Chips Dubbo is the BEST, next to Johnson!
[3:34:13] <%Gruhunchously> Sadly, AI development is not really something that has advanced in the past twenty years
[3:34:13] <TheChucklingOak> God I love the graphic switching feature
[3:34:15] <%brachydios777> Especially Reach
[3:34:21] <Goraka91> That graphics on/off thing is really neat
[3:34:22] <Ninjalettuce> SourPls
[3:34:25] <%RioGascar> A fun thing I remember is marines dive down on the ground and if you ram em they may just dive underneath the ghost
[3:34:27] <%dinnydanny777> Woops
[3:34:30] <%reknownblackcat> OH MY GOD YES
[3:34:31] <TheChucklingOak> Can't forget about Stacker for best NPC's
[3:34:38] <%RioGascar> Which they do survive
[3:34:46] <+Fenrein> You can totally fit a ghost in there
[3:34:47] <Goraka91> @Gruhunchously MrDestructoid That you know of
[3:34:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheChucklingOak i mean he's just white johnson
[3:34:49] <+Reaverund> Halo AI is amazing until you ask a marine to drive.
[3:34:52] <+Fenrein> You just gotta nudge it
[3:34:54] <%doomerskeletor13> So this is gonna be like a two stream game right? I remember it not being too long
[3:34:55] <drewslo> good till 4 then it actually gets kind of brain dead
[3:34:56] <%Pyretech> pro tip for reloading - if you double-tap reload, you can put the gun away and it'll reload in your backpack
[3:34:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait how the fuck did Stacker survive? or Chips?
[3:35:06] <TheChucklingOak> OH wow I never thought of that
[3:35:08] <BlueSpartan119> walk over rockets
[3:35:09] <Nomad94> @Gruhunchously I don't think you can generalize it like that. depending on the game, AI has to behave a certain measure of stupidly because otherwise it would feel like the computer's cheating.
[3:35:10] <XxCGxOblivionxX> Same way Johnson did
[3:35:13] <alrobot2014> @lewdskeletor13 next mission is pretty much the halfway point
[3:35:14] <hattrick61> The book explains
[3:35:14] <%raven_frame> *Crunch*
[3:35:15] <%reknownblackcat> First Kotor 2 and now Halo CE! Thank you Little V and Woolie!
[3:35:17] <Axle13j> that grunt got fucked lol
[3:35:18] <$QueequegTheater> @LiquidDinosaur Shut up, it's fine, that's how
[3:35:22] <%dinnydanny777> This level looks nice in Classic
[3:35:26] <%raven_frame> The sound design is spot on in this.
[3:35:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater fair enough
[3:35:27] <Kifachu> what difficulty are they playing on
[3:35:33] <+Kindan55> I forgot how quick these levels were on normal.
[3:35:34] <XxCGxOblivionxX> Normal
[3:35:34] <hattrick61> norm
[3:35:34] <Axle13j> tha guy too lol
[3:35:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Normal
[3:35:35] <Nomad94> Normal
[3:35:37] <CurrySauseBandit> @Gruhunchously ? AI tech has advanced a lot in the last 20 years. You'll just never see good AI in video games. People complain way more otherwise
[3:35:37] <+Grayhammatter> normal
[3:35:37] <Kifachu> gotcha
[3:35:39] <Griffin1171> PINCERS
[3:35:41] <%notgarza> Double Lariato
[3:35:46] <centuronstar> Normal probably
[3:35:48] <Goraka91> It's less making the AI smart, it's handicapping it without making it seem unnatural
[3:35:49] <%dinnydanny777> The levels look good in both modes
[3:35:51] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> this music is what would happen if the blue man group did the halo theme.
[3:35:51] <%Pyretech> pro tip for reloading - if you double-tap reload, you can put the gun away and it'll reload in your backpack
[3:35:51] <+callmelyra_> Oh shit, woolie is playing HALO?
[3:35:57] <%StaceMcGate> Is the Pistol still the most overpowered weapon in this game?
[3:36:02] <%Pyretech> yes
[3:36:02] <%raven_frame> Banshee splattering is hilarious.
[3:36:04] <+SashaStarshine> Yes
[3:36:05] <iamtheTwitchghost> @StaceMcGate ye
[3:36:05] <AppleBerryKitty> normal and im still confused why grunts are tossing this many nades. I guess they change it on the pc version years back.
[3:36:05] <XxCGxOblivionxX> yes
[3:36:07] <+ghostfaceninja_> yes
[3:36:09] <passion4slashing> They just passed the rocket launcher !!!
[3:36:11] <+JohnRSoviet> @12char2short indeed
[3:36:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater i just mean how they bothered to make an excuse for Johnson. that he's immune to the Flood because he's a Spartan 1 and also might have som weird neurological disorder
[3:36:12] <%brachydios777> @stacemcgate Yep
[3:36:19] <Nomad94> @CurrySauseBandit Exactly what I said. Imagine a stealth game with guards that behave reasonably. if you go too far, you'll never ever get out of an Alert Phase
[3:36:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah it’s not hard to make good AI, it’s hard to make AI that isn’t inherently op
[3:36:47] <Nomad94> AI has to be dumb, but not TOO dumb
[3:36:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:36:58] <centuronstar> It'd be great if they played up to 4. I enjoyed 4's story
[3:36:58] <Ynkubus_> @LiquidDinosaur and some plasma wounds effects
[3:37:03] <%RioGascar> halo made AI that had different states and dynamics depending on which enemies they were with as well as making them different to fight and interesting
[3:37:06] <dabeaminator> If you aren't reading them who cares?
[3:37:06] <%RioGascar> Which to me
[3:37:07] <%GoogleyGareth> SourPls
[3:37:10] <%RioGascar> Beats smart ai
[3:37:11] <Goraka91> I hear Thief and FEAR had good AI?
[3:37:11] <+wunp_fxs> kinda
[3:37:13] <+Karkatstoaster> See I love Halo’s Lore but it does kinda fall into the same problem as Starship Troopers, 40K, etc where it describes an overtly authoritarian and fascist state and then is p uncritical of it (or at least portrays it as the best option) most of the time. And you can’t really tell how much of it is parody vs unironic jingoism.
[3:37:13] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> SourPls
[3:37:13] <+MaddyCaddy> Reactor:Online
[3:37:13] <XxCGxOblivionxX> @LiquidDinosaur the neurological disorder and plasma stuff was the cover-up, him being a Spartan-I is the real reason
[3:37:15] <Sauceboss15> this is my fav song
[3:37:15] <AppleBerryKitty> in the middle you need ot nade jump for it and you passed it WAY back
[3:37:17] <Ninjalettuce> SourPls
[3:37:18] <andrei11dr> Man ,it sure is nice that these aliens decided to name their shit after a bunch of human words and concepts
[3:37:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Ynkubus18 i think i twas origianlly just the plasma stuff but then they retconned it to be he's a Spartan 1
[3:37:19] <Axle13j> doon doon doon
[3:37:20] <+wunp_fxs> fuck i miss mechwarrior
[3:37:21] <Prince_Robot> huge mechwarrio 2 vibes here
[3:37:22] <CurrySauseBandit> @Nomad94 Yeah, just saw as I looked up xD. But yeah, I could imagine it, but I could also imagine a reddit forum going. OMG SO UNFUN LUL
[3:37:22] <SubjectX07x> Is THIS our new LP? Okay.. sure.
[3:37:24] <TheChucklingOak> Yeyeye, the music is so good in Halo
[3:37:26] <%LoganWulfric> This track is so good
[3:37:27] <SubjectX07x> I'm fine with this.
[3:37:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @XxCGxOblivionxX ah ok thanks.
[3:37:29] <Catpurrple> This is one of my favorite tracks I think
[3:37:36] <BlueSpartan119> Marty knows his stuff
[3:37:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> god i love the music in this game so much
[3:37:42] <%doomerskeletor13> @karkatstoaster We’ll Starship Troopers is entirely parody and satire
[3:37:45] <TheChucklingOak> ODST and Halo Wars 1 have some real bangers as well
[3:37:48] <+Karkatstoaster> Like it’s far from the worst in that regard but it’s still off putting sometimes
[3:37:51] <+TheShisno> Marty and Michael knew the tone
[3:37:54] <XxCGxOblivionxX> OG Halo OSTs were absolutely top tier, Marty is a god
[3:38:04] <%dinnydanny777> @karkatstoaster The 3rd or 4th game was pretty critical of it as far as I recall
[3:38:07] <XxCGxOblivionxX> even the non-Marty stuff was great
[3:38:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lewdskeletor13 the movie is. the book wasnt.
[3:38:20] <%BisoromiBear> burs
[3:38:25] <%doomerskeletor13> I’m only familiar with the movie so I didn’t know that
[3:38:27] <+Vorga1339> this track reminds me of a slow deus ex song
[3:38:27] <DinoBear_7> Higher difficulties the Plasma Rifle takes over due to its stun on elites
[3:38:30] <Nomad94> Halo 2 Legendary is "God I Hope I Make it to the next Checkpoint" central
[3:38:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lewdskeletor13 not that Heinlein was necessarily a fascist. he had lots of conflicting views in his books. the one thing he's consistent about is "fucking kids is ok"
[3:38:34] <centuronstar> @BlueSpartan119 Hey man. I'm Dark.
[3:38:37] <XxCGxOblivionxX> ODST's jazz music is absolutely baller
[3:38:37] <Goraka91> 40k on the other is definitely a yikes, it seems they forgot it was over the top a couple editions back
[3:38:37] <dabeaminator> @Karkatstoaster It's not portraying it positively. The novels are all about how evil the UNSC and ONI can be, and how humanity was in a civil war over it before the Covenant showed up.
[3:38:38] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[3:38:44] <+Grayhammatter> aw
[3:38:50] <+TheShisno> Halo is SourPls the genre
[3:38:52] <Nomad94> @LiquidDinosaur that's an oof
[3:39:08] <BlueSpartan119> @centuronstar yeah I thought so
[3:39:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> Pre-covenant, Halo is just Gundam without the mechs
[3:39:10] <TheChucklingOak> I gotta say, It's been super rad to see Woolie's FPS prowess grow
[3:39:11] <%brachydios777> Can someone explain SourPls?
[3:39:12] <+TheShisno> ZOOM
[3:39:13] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie in danger
[3:39:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> its Earth oppressing colonies
[3:39:15] <Spirit_NB> 360 Full Charge
[3:39:17] <slatersev> ONI being evil is very canon
[3:39:21] <slatersev> there never good
[3:39:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> or, earth+loyal colonies oppressing other colonies
[3:39:22] <SubjectX07x> Halo 1 physics are goofy as fuck lol.
[3:39:26] <%doomerskeletor13> @brachydios777 It’s a BTTV emote
[3:39:28] <Nomad94> @brachydios777 It's a gif of a guy doing a little dance in a grocery store
[3:39:28] <+Vorga1339> can't wait for when woolie finally looks at Doom1/2
[3:39:30] <falyden> mech warrior?
[3:39:32] <ZeeJiggle> @brachydios777 BTTV extension emote, is dancin'
[3:39:32] <+TheShisno> SourPls is something you saye when a music track gets you in the mood to dance
[3:39:34] <NotHereToStream> ragdoll will forever be good in any game
[3:39:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> ALSO: i've noticed that the ONI base in Reach is shaped exactly like the police HQ in Oni
[3:39:38] <+TheShisno> say*
[3:39:39] <+Karkatstoaster> I do seem to remember that being a thing in the novels. If it is in the games, tho, it’s v suttle
[3:39:42] <derap41> sourPls
[3:39:43] <+Karkatstoaster> Subtle*
[3:39:44] <%dinnydanny777> Doesn't humanity violently pressure the covenant into their actions in this game?
[3:39:47] <Goraka91> Spartans were made to beat down those whose souls weren't weighed down by gravity
[3:39:48] <XxCGxOblivionxX> Woolie playing Doom 64 would be amazing holy shit
[3:39:52] <slatersev> Hood is treated as a hero because he refuses to let ONI rule or displace the civilian gov
[3:39:53] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[3:39:56] <%brachydios777> @theshisno Ah
[3:39:58] <SubjectX07x> @dinnydanny777 Not exactly.
[3:40:00] <XxCGxOblivionxX> @dinnydanny777 nah, Covenant shot first
[3:40:01] <Nomad94> @dinnydanny777 No? Humanity is fleeing from them the whole game
[3:40:02] <%Pyretech> pro tip for reloading - if you double-tap reload, you can put the gun away and it'll reload in your backpack
[3:40:04] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur there’s even rampant nuke use too!
[3:40:05] <slatersev> no
[3:40:06] <Naho_Saenoki> @brachydios777 Good song is playing, you wanna dance, SourPls If you don't see the gif, there are plugins to install.
[3:40:11] <%stemlo_> @dinnydanny777 Not that I can remmeber: IIRC This war 100% on the Prophets
[3:40:18] <slatersev> Humanity is fighting for its life in the OG tirlogy
[3:40:22] <slatersev> there just defending
[3:40:23] <+Vorga1339> it would be cool if he played one of the throwback FPS like Dusk but those require a lot of snap aiming
[3:40:26] <Nomad94> this war is 100% not humanity's fault...for a change
[3:40:30] <%dinnydanny777> Oh right
[3:40:33] <+krabsan> LUL
[3:40:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:40:35] <OverlordLuna> LUL
[3:40:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> i said this multiple times in this chat but the UNSC is a fascist dictatorship who was using unethical child soldiers long before an alien race bent on wiping out humanity made that morally justifiable
[3:40:41] <%brachydios777> Convenat are super a holes
[3:40:46] <penitentpentwitch> The Khan Makyr's Bong
[3:40:50] <dankvonmemelord> halo rings are just giant esoteric bongs
[3:40:51] <BlackermanZX> CRACK
[3:40:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Halo is a giant bong
[3:40:53] <Ynkubus_> That bong takes you on one dangerous "trip"
[3:40:53] <dabeaminator> It's entirely a defensive war. Humanity is on the backfoot the whole time.
[3:40:53] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's a Methane Bong
[3:40:56] <%doomerskeletor13> The war was started after the Prophets realized that the Humans were the Reclaimers and that they had been misinterpreting Forerunner stuff
[3:40:56] <slatersev> yeah the Cov attacking them is the one thing humanity is faultless for
[3:40:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Why OG graphics?
[3:41:05] <+SashaStarshine> Grunts are canonically super sick though
[3:41:07] <derap41> Grunts are not soldiers they're workers
[3:41:09] <%brachydios777> *Covenant
[3:41:11] <+TheShisno> Halo is a centrifugal bong
[3:41:13] <+Karkatstoaster> It’s one of those things where I’m sure the lore is clear on how shitty the more fashy human stuff is, but it’s hidden enough dudebros will play through the whole thing and won’t get the message
[3:41:16] <Nomad94> @LiquidDinosaur well, yeah, but they still didn't start the war against the covenant, at all. the child soldiers just came in handy LUL

[3:41:33] <correctedsun117> I must go, my planet needs me
[3:41:33] <%kinetikpaws> weeeee
[3:41:33] <%dinnydanny777> Didn't the UNSC used to glass planets canonically?
[3:41:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> OH ALSO TIDBIT FROM ONE OF THE LAST BOOKS I READ: Prophet of Regret *fucks* and is bisexual. Prophet of Mercy does not fuck. Prophet of Truth occasionally fucks but doesnt really care
[3:41:35] <BlueSpartan119> GOD I LOVE HALO'S SANDBOX
[3:41:35] <Griffin1171> Who needs banshees

[3:41:42] <%brunoberserk> my planet need me
[3:41:43] <%dinnydanny777> I thought the UNSC glasses fucking planets
[3:41:44] <%stemlo_> @dinnydanny777 No
[3:41:45] <hattrick61> my planate needs me *dwooooo*
[3:41:47] <+zerosmss> to the moon!
[3:41:48] <slatersev> dudebrros who played halo only played MP
[3:41:53] <andrei11dr> 9-11
[3:41:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 they're bad but no they dont glass planets
[3:41:56] <%doomerskeletor13> @karkatstoaster I think it’s mostly because the first three games barely touch on any of that lore from the novels
[3:41:56] <+SashaStarshine> @LiquidDinosaur Unsubscribe from Prophet facts
[3:41:56] <SubjectX07x> @dinnydanny777 TLDR humans fiddled with forerunner shit which according to the covenants fake ass religion set up by the prophets as an excuse to fire the halo rings, is big heresy.
[3:42:00] <%MrMoonGoose> He ain't regretting that d*ck
[3:42:00] <%stemlo_> @dinnydanny777 The Covenant glasses planets all the fucking time
[3:42:02] <Nomad94> @dinnydanny777 no, the covenant glasses planets with the lasers on Supercarriers
[3:42:02] <+TheShisno> UNSC never had tech to glass planets. best they got is nukes
[3:42:03] <TheChucklingOak> I don't need to know that the prophets fuck. I don't like the image
[3:42:05] <Goraka91> Regret against proving he's the best Prophet
[3:42:06] <+ManOfReason> What form of power is this
[3:42:10] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Covenant
[3:42:16] <+Karkatstoaster> @lewdskeletor13 yeah for sure
[3:42:18] <dabeaminator> The fascistic human government is really only in the novels, so it's not exactly something you'd be "missing" in the games. It's only hinted at in Reach.
[3:42:25] <%stemlo_> @TheShisno Arguably the best is the MAC cannons
[3:42:26] <%raven_frame> The prophets used to be hot.
[3:42:35] <%raven_frame> They have muscle girls.
[3:42:36] <Ynkubus_> @TheShisno including planet killers - cluster nukes
[3:42:45] <+ManOfReason> Jesus
[3:42:47] <%doomerskeletor13> Fuck the UNSC. All my homies hate the UNSC
[3:42:48] <%Feralspirit41> Unless youre playing solo
[3:42:50] <%dinnydanny777> I haven't played these games in a long time
[3:42:57] <$QueequegTheater> WORT WORT WORT
[3:42:58] <Goraka91> Also the Prophets never wanted to use the rings, Truth suddenly did in 3 because REASONS

[3:43:07] <%subjectg> @ynkubus18 reminder that admiral whitcomb was the sickest
[3:43:09] <slatersev> and they only do it once
[3:43:11] <+einherjarvalk> Humans didn't fiddle with Forerunner tech, the Covenant was looking for it and when the discovered humanity their captured Forerunner AI told them they were translating wrong
[3:43:11] <GHouseduivel> So bullshit the game.
[3:43:11] <+MonsieurHedge> and greunt birthday party

[3:43:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LASO is eternal suffering
[3:43:16] <The_RDDM> pretty much "please kill me" mode

[3:43:33] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 The Arbiter, he’s really cool
[3:43:35] <+einherjarvalk> so the Covenant starred a genocide rather than admit their religion was based on a mistranslation
[3:43:41] <DinoBear_7> Worst is Reach because grunt ultras have those helmets
[3:43:45] <AppleBerryKitty> their reach laso was the best one imo
[3:43:52] <derap41> @einherjarvalk hush not child

[3:43:53] <%dinnydanny777> Yeah the Arbiter is cool
[3:43:54] <+TheShisno> @einherjarvalk Much like real life
[3:43:56] <%doomerskeletor13> @joestar1890 Nah fuck the Covenant too. Message brought to you by the Independent gang
[3:43:57] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> wasnt reach laso no checkpoints
[3:43:59] <%stemlo_> @dinnydanny777 is a Covenant sympathizer confirmed: ONI agents have been dispatched
[3:44:00] <Nomad94> @einherjarvalk to be fair, humanity has a history of going for that kind of solution
[3:44:05] <TheChucklingOak> Don't forget that back in the Forerunner days, San-shyuum and humanity were BFFs
[3:44:09] <%mrblack499> can you turn the gun sideways
[3:44:16] <%raven_frame> There might be a reason for there to be persistent bodies.
[3:44:17] <%mrblack499> lol
[3:44:20] <Goraka91> @TheChucklingOak Ironic.
[3:44:24] <dabeaminator> The rune for "relic" and the rune for "reclaimer (human)" are the same but inverted. the Covenant mistook the two, and invaded human space thinking it was full of relics.
[3:44:25] <+Karkatstoaster> I do think you could make a very decent case for the covenant wars being a metaphor for the iraq conflict. Group of religious fanatics misinterpreting a religious document initiate a war against a highly militaristic power. I’m not really sure how intentional that is tho
[3:44:33] <%dinnydanny777> Tbh I used to play the multiplayer with my Brother I didn't remember the whole plot that much
[3:44:42] <+Codex5050> is that little V?
[3:44:44] <+einherjarvalk> 343's weirdest lore addition: everyone wanted to bang the Prophets
[3:44:50] <+einherjarvalk> it's the ball chins
[3:44:52] <%stemlo_> @Codex5050 It absolutely is
[3:44:56] <%Gruhunchously> @Karkatstoaster The game came out before the Iraq war really entered into piblic consciousness.
[3:44:56] <+Codex5050> nice
[3:44:59] <+Karkatstoaster> I mean have you seen a prophet /s
[3:45:00] <slatersev> Halo 1 came out in Nov 2001
[3:45:06] <slatersev> it came out before Iraq started
[3:45:08] <ChocalateDog203> @einherjarvalk isnt it only the ancient prophets that were sexy
[3:45:12] <%doomerskeletor13> @karkatstoaster It’s very intentional. They had to change the Arbiters original name because it was something from Islamic religion
[3:45:13] <slatersev> and was being made before 9/11
[3:45:17] <Ynkubus_> @einherjarvalk grab their eear lobes for extra grip
[3:45:20] <Decimated_body> wort wort wort
[3:45:27] <Nomad94> @lewdskeletor13 Wasn't it Dervish?
[3:45:29] <IntrepidEye> The games and the first came came out before 9/11 much less the Iraq war
[3:45:30] <TheChucklingOak> Yeah, Arbiter was originally gonna be Dervish
[3:45:37] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Basically the Covenant are waging a holy crusade against Humanity because their prophets deemed them unclean for their great journey
[3:45:42] <centuronstar> @einherjarvalk They wanted to bang the ancient Prophets. This was before they looked like Ball Sacks on Hover Chairs
[3:45:42] <Goraka91> I mean Halo is called halo, religious symbolism was there even without real life stuff
[3:45:47] <dabeaminator> Wtf 343, the Prophets are literal incels
[3:45:55] <+Karkatstoaster> Oh huh. I mean there were religious conflicts like that before 9/11, so that doesn’t rule it out, but still interesting
[3:45:57] <%doomerskeletor13> Y’all acting like there wasn’t any religious terrorism before 9/11
[3:46:05] <OverlordLuna> SourPls
[3:46:05] <+Grayhammatter> drums
[3:46:07] <%stemlo_> @brachydios777 Despite Humans being the Forerunners designated "Reclaimers"
[3:46:10] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[3:46:13] <%raven_frame> Chat is getting really weird.
[3:46:15] <%doomerskeletor13> SourPls
[3:46:19] <Nomad94> SourPls
[3:46:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 @brachydios777 welll that's the official story. Actually the Prophets found out that Humans are "the chosen ones" and had to kill them all before anyone finds out and threatens their power base
[3:46:23] <Goraka91> SourPls
[3:46:24] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I'd guess it was more inspired by warhammer 40k
[3:46:24] <Kougsss> chat is getting really based
[3:46:25] <Ninjalettuce> while discussion is good some of this stuff is veering into spoilers
[3:46:26] <%dinnydanny777> @brachydios777 But I thought the Humans were basically scumbags too, in 3 or 4 they talk about the whole child soldier thing, in Reach they basically seem to use Spartans as fodder
[3:46:26] <%EldritchBee> Yeah 9/11 was the big one to a lot of people, but there was ABSOLUTELY shit going down beforehand
[3:46:27] <TheChucklingOak> Buh buh buh buh, buh buh buh BUH
[3:46:29] <+TheShisno> the Crusades and the Inquisition are proof enough
[3:46:30] <derap41> @raven_frame They're discussing Halo Lore
[3:46:31] <Solidnick18> i remember this bridge good times
[3:46:33] <+ghostfaceninja_> CHAT
[3:46:39] <%stemlo_> @raven_frame HALO Lore does this to people
[3:46:42] <derap41> Of course shit gets weird
[3:46:49] <%stemlo_> Its in there
[3:46:50] <+Karkatstoaster> Halo lore is interesting af
[3:46:54] <Nomad94> Music gives the go-ahead
[3:46:58] <%stemlo_> It's the best dude
[3:46:58] <+TheShisno> Halo Lore can't just be Disney'd away
[3:46:59] <Goraka91> If Halo isn't enough we can talk about Sword Logic or something
[3:47:00] <solwayfifth> just tuned in, im assuming yall already had the discussion about using the new graphics instead of the old graphics
[3:47:01] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 That was a dick move, but it ended up saving humanity
[3:47:06] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuGun John Halo breebuGun
[3:47:08] <+einherjarvalk> @dinnydanny777 Reach Spartans are IIIs, they're basically mass-produced Spartans with less augs made from war orphans
[3:47:12] <dabeaminator> It's very good so long as you cut off your research at the 343 transition
[3:47:13] <derap41> @TheShisno oh just you wait
[3:47:13] <+einherjarvalk> they at least had a choice
[3:47:16] <%stemlo_> @solwayfifth Nah, deep HALO lore
[3:47:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheShisno
[3:47:20] <%raven_frame> It'll be later when they won't have as much time.
[3:47:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @einherjarvalk Jorge isnt
[3:47:21] <slatersev> the point of later games is humanity did alot of bad shit
[3:47:24] <%Gruhunchously> Halo's development was still tumultuous as hell though
[3:47:27] <AppleBerryKitty> i love this theme
[3:47:27] <%doomerskeletor13> @brachydios777 Ye but they also created them before the Covenant even attacked
[3:47:28] <TheChucklingOak> Supposedly the III's in reach got some extra augs tho
[3:47:29] <+einherjarvalk> Jorge is a II, he's the only one
[3:47:32] <slatersev> not that they were glassing planets
[3:47:36] <IntrepidEye> III's didn't have less augments. They were just as auged as the II's
[3:47:39] <+Karkatstoaster> Anyway Arbiter x Master Chief best ship Don’t @ Me
[3:47:51] <%brachydios777> @lewdskeletor13 True, doesn’t change the fact they saved humanity
[3:47:56] <%stemlo_> @einherjarvalk Jorge is a I
[3:47:57] <%subjectg> @karkatstoaster how can you say that when arbiter x rtas exists
[3:47:59] <slatersev> III's were just a broader gene pool
[3:47:59] <+einherjarvalk> must've been a retcon then bc Ghosts of Onyx made it clear IIIs were very much not on the levels of IIs
[3:47:59] <$QueequegTheater> @dinnydanny777 The Reach Spartans were S3's, Chief is an S2. The S2's are the child soldiers.

[3:48:47] <IntrepidEye> There was no retcon just people misinterpreting why the III's were cheaper to make and that they were used on suicide missions
[3:48:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater Spartan 3 are ALSO chlild soldiers and were basically made to die in mass suicide attacks against targets like Covenant fuel refineries and shipyeards. A few were taken out of the pool to be Noble Team etc

[3:51:41] <IntrepidEye> @LiquidDinosaur Pretty much. III's can be as good as the II's but only certain ones got Mjolnir later on and none of them have as much experience as the II's so the II's will alway have that advantage
[3:51:43] <+D00msDayDan> @LiquidDinosaur yeah, they show up later in the book last light, i don't think there's been any follow up on them since

[3:52:41] <%RioGascar> Lets be fair halo 1’s levels are mix of good/great & then have sections that are copy paste fillers
[3:52:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> FUCK THIS GIVE HER SHORT HAIR
[3:52:43] <%dinnydanny777> Cortana is a big problem in both games...

[3:52:51] <%Gruhunchously> If it was realistic, Cortana would be swearing like crazy.
[3:52:55] <$QueequegTheater> He's one of the dumb AIs
[3:52:55] <%ekodrop> EDGE
[3:52:56] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 5 onward
[3:52:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus NO IN HALO: CE CORTANA HAD SHORT HAIR
[3:52:59] <%dinnydanny777> Imagine having the entire world's knowledge inside your head
[3:53:01] <DigitalJoshie> the HD uses a more halo 3 cortana
[3:53:01] <+MaddyCaddy> She called you dumb
[3:53:02] <hattrick61> How is halo formed
[3:53:02] <IntrepidEye> I think Edge might be Warden Eternal
[3:53:03] <+Kindan55> Just wait for Bing

[3:53:20] <%dinnydanny777> Imagine basically being a human being and you have infinite knowledge
[3:53:21] <+Druuplays_> The wrestler?

[3:53:52] <slatersev> JENKINS
[3:53:52] <Catpurrple> One of gearbox's port screwups that wrecked classic's visuals is that Cortana is supposed to change colors a bunch, connected to halo's network, but instead she's just one color, like the broken jackal shields.

[3:55:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus Woolie please go back to OG graphics this level there's FOG
[3:55:46] <+cursedwithadhd> but that's no fun
[3:55:47] <dankvonmemelord> play this in classic the atmosphere isn't the same in remaster
[3:55:48] <+TheShisno> HUH?
[3:55:51] <%brachydios777> Good stream
[3:55:53] <+MaddyCaddy> That works in all versions of the game
[3:55:54] <The_RDDM> That'll be a hell of a way to end an episode
[3:55:57] <%Gruhunchously> I'll explain later
[3:55:58] <%alpacasintophats> what just happened?
[3:55:59] <DinoBear_7> The remaster fucked the atmosphere in this level so bad
[3:56:01] <+CaptainJax> Awww ending right before the best level
[3:56:02] <%RioGascar> We might be able to get this done in 2 streams
[3:56:03] <%Pyretech> pro tip for reloading - if you double-tap reload, you can put the gun away and it'll reload in your backpack
[3:56:06] <Goraka91> Alas
[3:56:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Edging us
[3:56:18] <RahuHordika> it's good, next time we get the good stuff
[3:56:23] <%optimasmaximas> oof

[3:56:24] <dankvonmemelord> !uptime
[3:56:25] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 13 minutes
[3:56:27] <Solidnick18> ooh

[3:56:48] <VestigeOuroboros> Eh, youtube will destroy it anyway.
[3:56:49] <%brunoberserk> i need a explanation
[3:56:51] <ZeeJiggle> Get some gross interpolation on it
[3:56:51] <dabeaminator> You'll be done in one more stream
[3:56:52] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Anime filler always has bad animation, it's fine
[3:56:57] <Axle13j> that's gonna be weird lol
[3:57:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheChucklingOak so long as someone with clout can tell him to play 343 Guilty Spark in old graphics only
[3:57:11] <andrei11dr> So the final score for today was 13-14 loads of suicides there LUL
[3:57:17] <SubjectX07x> So here's the question, are they playing JUST halo 1, or the others up to reach?
[3:57:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie what did you think of John Haloman
[3:57:33] <iamtheTwitchghost> it's fine
[3:57:38] <%prime_name> Its fiiiine
[3:57:38] <ralphfromdk> Mihn needs a challenge :D
[3:57:38] <TheChucklingOak> The old graphics would be nice, but I think it's still a good experience regardless.
[3:57:46] <%brachydios777> Oh well
[3:57:46] <%a_goth_pancake> you had one job
[3:57:51] <+ghostfaceninja_> i really hope they play 2 cause there's way more lore in 2
[3:57:53] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie make sure to play the first level next session in old graphics only, the new designs for the next sections are meh
[3:57:53] <derap41> Not bugs these are exploits
[3:57:53] <%subjectg> so what do you think of halo: haloes in space so far
[3:57:53] <%doomerskeletor13> @subjectx07x They’re doing this game for the LP, no announced plans to do the others
[3:57:58] <%notgarza> FEATURES*
[3:57:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:57:59] <SubjectX07x> Gotcha.
[3:58:00] <ZeeJiggle> Maybe do it regular lol
[3:58:02] <dabeaminator> It's a good level though
[3:58:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Features!
[3:58:08] <+How2BEpic> I think it's far less than half honestly.
[3:58:13] <slatersev> you have to do it normal
[3:58:17] <%Indigo_Automaton> Oblivion
[3:58:23] <%Indigo_Automaton> Paintbrush stairs
[3:58:25] <SubjectX07x> @WoolieVersus Halo's engine is notoriously built out of sticks, hopes and dreams.
[3:58:26] <+wunp_fxs> hl2 has some crazy ones
[3:58:28] <VestigeOuroboros> Halo 2 players were pissed that the MCC patched out superbounces.
[3:58:29] <%brachydios777> It’s great
[3:58:29] <Ynkubus_> iys more like a 3rd or 4th
[3:58:33] <%subjectg> @woolieversus if you think you can handle it, you could try upgrading to heroic for a decent challenge
[3:58:34] <vaderxyz1970> are they not going to finish?
[3:58:35] <+Fenrein> That level is the one you should play on classic
[3:58:40] <%brunoberserk> portal have some crazy sequence breaks
[3:58:40] <derap41> Oblivions is really good (or bad) about that
[3:58:53] <TheChucklingOak> The only time Woolie truly needs to use old graphics is if he does 2, so he can hear Breaking Benjamin.... and get DMCA
[3:58:55] <derap41> This game launched you woolie
[3:58:56] <AnthroMetal> not to mention matchmaking
[3:59:02] <slatersev> Halo 1 didnt create machinima
[3:59:04] <%RioGascar> This game did launch you
[3:59:11] <AnthroMetal> oh shit
[3:59:11] <%dinnydanny777> I really wanted more :/
[3:59:17] <faeron93> Woolie knows his history
[3:59:17] <AnthroMetal> that's some real old school shit
[3:59:17] <+Kindan55> Drunk tank, right?
[3:59:17] <huskarl_zap> doom
[3:59:17] <slatersev> but it did popluarize it
[3:59:18] <+Ropcord> THE LORE

[3:59:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @TheChucklingOak Anniversary took the song out

[3:59:35] <%Gruhunchously> Cock Bite
[3:59:36] <%Chatterbox1991> dont forget 4PlayerPodcast
[3:59:36] <TheChucklingOak> I recall the new graphics have a new song, but the song is still there in OG form
[3:59:37] <shhteaky> Thats some genuine Boomer tier internet tech
[3:59:39] <SubjectX07x> @LiquidDinosaur Yes.. yes they did.

[3:59:53] <+Grizzytron> I am today years old and I finally understood the cock bite thing
[3:59:53] <Arweynn> If you're super careful, you can drop down off the first bridge in control room and it breaks all the spawns in the level. The game is full of these.

[4:01:59] <+ActionWords> we gonna do legendary Halo 2 next? valeSmug
[4:02:02] <TheChucklingOak> So many of Halo's fights feel like true "battles" with multiple distinct parts
[4:02:04] <Mr__Jebus> Gears
[4:02:09] <penitentpentwitch> I am enjoying the Dark Side run of Halo. Woolie's Betrayal count is at least 3. There must always Be a Traya.
[4:02:23] <+Kindan55> Definitely gotten better again.
[4:02:26] <derap41> Lot of Poping colors
[4:02:33] <%brachydios777> Even Doom Eternal

[4:03:00] <%stemlo_> stemlo_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hey. Mostly an "anime" watcher, but I'm glad to see some HALO. There was a time in my life where I had consumed all the extant media for this, including the novels. Great lore. Hi from Houston.
[4:03:04] <derap41> Its funny the improved graphics in this remake makes the game looks less colorful
[4:03:06] <StarlitStunner> stripNya @binaryshuffle
[4:03:09] <rubbishbinge> reality is for dweebs
[4:03:09] <+ghostfaceninja_> good thing realism isn't the most popular FPS game right now Kappa
[4:03:09] <+ActionWords> @KingVantq I'd pay to see that though valeSip
[4:03:09] <shhteaky> BinaryShuffle LULW
[4:03:14] <asd2897> Thanks for the PrideRise @stemlo_
[4:03:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dabeaminator always forget Doom 3
[4:03:24] <%Irridium> ARMA boys
[4:03:27] <%subjectg> ARMA is cool though
[4:03:32] <%dinnydanny777> Halo is basically a fantasy fps
[4:03:34] <+ActionWords> so how far are we in Halo though? Just tuning in
[4:03:35] <derap41> Arma and Operation Flash point was the shit
[4:03:40] <%stemlo_> @asd2897 NP dude!
[4:03:42] <%Irridium> @ActionWords about halfway
[4:03:43] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus My favorite part of Halo's AI is the way the enemies react with fear towards the squad leader Elites getting killed
[4:03:46] <+einherjarvalk> @ActionWords he stopped at 343 GS
[4:03:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ActionWords Just got to 343 Guilty Spark
[4:03:49] <+ActionWords> ohhhh gotcha
[4:03:51] <%dinnydanny777> Space opera
[4:03:53] <Catpurrple> I feel similarly to Woolie on that, but arma and stuff are cool too.
[4:03:57] <+ActionWords> thanks y'all
[4:03:57] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 More heavy sci-fi
[4:04:06] <TheChucklingOak> There's some good ass halo art, I've got a "universe" book for it from the 3 era and there's some dope pieces in it
[4:04:07] <+JivetheSuperTurkey> is it ending soon or is this an intermission
[4:04:11] <rubbishbinge> Okami holds up real well
[4:04:17] <%dinnydanny777> @brachydios777 Sci Fi is just fantasy with extra steps lol
[4:04:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> Arma
[4:04:25] <dabeaminator> It's been four hours, I assume they're done
[4:04:26] <@Solidus_113> then you play ARMA
[4:04:28] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Kinda

[4:04:45] <+MaddyCaddy> When the games get so realistic and they're not fun anymore
[4:04:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> until ARMA's physics bug out and you're playing arcade again Kappa
[4:04:49] <$Fortunato5678> Monitor doesn't support it, maybe?
[4:04:50] <+Kindan55> Think fullscreen might effect it>

[4:05:10] <dabeaminator> Those being Contact Harvest, Cole Protocol, and Fall of Reach?
[4:05:18] <+Kindan55> Vsync might need to be off
[4:05:19] <@Solidus_113> could it be something with Vsync
[4:05:21] <andrei11dr> I was like that with Tekken, but i actually started training, i realized that Tekken isn't trying to be realistic and loved it
[4:05:23] <yficaptions> That AC must be going strong if Woolie is in long sleeves
[4:05:23] <Graywolf_the_45th> Thanks for the PrideUnicorn @lavenderlaser
[4:05:28] <TheChucklingOak> Woolie honestly doesn't need to read the books or comics, because NONE of the games until 4 dive into EU stuff

[4:10:08] <+Samsquanch> they aren't lol
[4:10:09] <TheChucklingOak> my headcanon is that ONI was a recruitment tool by ONI to convice the people of the UNSC that they were just cool heroic secret agents. And the game is jank because ONI is always incompetent
[4:10:10] <%Irridium> 2013?
[4:10:12] <Jolly_Adventurer> I'm very cautious about infinite
[4:10:12] <+Freeborg1997> Is 5 canon?
[4:10:13] <derap41> Hale after Reach is pointless
[4:10:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's just deep angry bad voice voice
[4:10:16] <dukenux> it's setting in NotLikeThis

[4:10:26] <%dinnydanny777> Johnathan Halomans 6
[4:10:28] <VestigeOuroboros> 24 more years of finishing the fight
[4:10:28] <AnthroMetal> TableHere
[4:10:28] <zocano> Halo Wars is good
[4:10:28] <dabeaminator> Stop at Reach
[4:10:29] <Ynkubus_> Its a differnt fight
[4:10:30] <SkreamnRedSkull> Finish the fight again... AGAIN
[4:10:33] <BlackermanZX> Halo wars is the shit i love it
[4:10:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> nobody is as good at pseudo-mystical technobabble as Bungie
[4:10:34] <+MaddyCaddy> It's good
[4:10:34] <+cursedwithadhd> FUCK YEA
[4:10:34] <slatersev> Wars is fun
[4:10:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> Wars is Hype
[4:10:35] <%a_goth_pancake> hope you can walk across that ring.
[4:10:37] <TheChucklingOak> Halo Wars 1 is sooo good
[4:10:37] <+Invaderjaymz> Halo Wars is amaaaaaaazing
[4:10:37] <%prime_name> Halo Wars is super fun
[4:10:37] <AnthroMetal> Halo Wars is good time
[4:10:37] <%tyler274> Halo Wars IS FUN
[4:10:38] <SkreamnRedSkull> ... again
[4:10:38] <derap41> Babies first RTS
[4:10:39] <slatersev> Was 2 is the shit
[4:10:39] <%brachydios777> @freeborg23 Unfortunately yes, guessing 6 will be quality control
[4:10:40] <+Grayhammatter> EDF 6? PogChamp
[4:10:41] <+rosabellamelantha> stop at reach
[4:10:41] <Catpurrple> If we're talking about infinite, I'm glad they're working on fixing their art style, but I don't have hope for the writing.
[4:10:41] <+elite867> Wars is great
[4:10:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> Halo was originally going to be an RTS
[4:10:43] <%Irridium> Halo Wars was real solid
[4:10:45] <+Grizzytron> We gotta start new fights and then finish them. That's the military-industrial complex, baby!
[4:10:46] <%dinnydanny777> Does Halo Wars have DEEP LORE woolieLORE
[4:10:47] <+Kindan55> It is by the Total War guys
[4:10:47] <niddron> there's a halo wars 2 right?
[4:10:49] <nothuzad> EDF 6 next year Kreygasm
[4:10:49] <andrei11dr> Wars is solid
[4:10:52] <%black_pariah> there's a logical endpoint to the state of that universe
[4:10:54] <Whyverns> wars also has that really good cinematic
[4:10:54] <Mr__Jebus> a little too stripped down for me personally
[4:10:55] <xtosuplex> all units!
[4:10:57] <%dinnydanny777> Does Halo Wars have the DEEP LORE?? woolieLORE
[4:10:58] <penitentpentwitch> The magic murder ball!
[4:11:02] <nothuzad> yeap halo wars was made by Total War people
[4:11:03] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Wars 1 is be for Halo 1
[4:11:03] <KingVantq> @dinnydanny777 i think so
[4:11:03] <%BisoromiBear> It's fun, but it's baby food
[4:11:04] <dabeaminator> Wars is good, but stop at Reach for the main series
[4:11:06] <Explodincatz> A-move to victory
[4:11:08] <Shwepie> Didn't Halo 5 add a whole new faction just because?
[4:11:12] <+ActionWords> Oh did we talk about halo lore yet?
[4:11:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @MonoRain ALL UNITS ALL UNITS ALL UNITS
[4:11:15] <%brachydios777> *before
[4:11:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> LOCAL UNITS
[4:11:20] <+zerosmss> dropping ODSTs in Wars is pretty satisfying
[4:11:21] <%subjectg> death blobs is chad rts gameplay
[4:11:23] <+krabsan> halo 3 was the last one i played
[4:11:26] <%Irridium> 4 added the new faction. 5 refined it a bit but... eh
[4:11:27] <+ActionWords> cause the halo lore is the dumbest imo LUL
[4:11:31] <+ActionWords> it's fun
[4:11:31] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> Its an RTS through and through
[4:11:32] <%dinnydanny777> Sometimes reality is better than the dreams
[4:11:34] <+ActionWords> but dumb
[4:11:36] <extradopeness> Halo Wars was fun
[4:11:38] <TheChucklingOak> Ever watch the Spartan fight scene in Halo Wars 1? The bridge fight?
[4:11:41] <%dinnydanny777> Sometimes the realities is better than the dreams

[4:12:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> nah
[4:12:42] <%BisoromiBear> shoot and 'splode
[4:12:43] <%stemlo_> John Halo is a career soldier
[4:12:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MC is NOT on Doomguys level
[4:12:47] <DinoBear_7> He does a few rips, a little tear
[4:12:48] <%Indigo_Automaton> Subdue and Eliminate
[4:12:49] <@Solidus_113> Now you can watch that old animation of Chief vs Samus
[4:12:50] <%SilvaChariot0133> Beat them to death with their own skulls
[4:12:51] <TheChucklingOak> They do call John Halo "Demon", which is interesting.
[4:12:52] <NotHereToStream> clean kills only,
[4:12:54] <%brachydios777> John is a professional
[4:12:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> he's a soldier not a wrrior
[4:12:56] <%a_goth_pancake> eh, he can rip.
[4:12:56] <dabeaminator> Spartans are black ops specialists, not bulldozers.
[4:12:56] <glass_marcus> Shoot n Clock out
[4:12:58] <GHouseduivel> It's not because he is angry, its just a job
[4:12:58] <%dinnydanny777> The Covenant are not demons
[4:13:00] <BinaryShuffle> but what about that opening of Halo 3
[4:13:04] <Axle13j> professionally annihilate everything hostile
[4:13:04] <+D00msDayDan> master chief isn't a robot but he's a robot
[4:13:05] <%DemonOfSalt> Thanks guys! :)
[4:13:05] <slatersev> Chief is just doing his job
[4:13:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Solidus_113 Not til he sees that Halo 3 tech

[4:13:11] <%prime_name> Well, was sane
[4:13:11] <$Fortunato5678> More of a One Shot, One Kill guy
[4:13:11] <%subjectg> Tell that to the Covenant
[4:13:11] <+jiggy_snipe> wasn't Doomguy a marine?
[4:13:13] <%dinnydanny777> Worth noting that the Covenant are not evil
[4:13:15] <starlessdan> Remember guys; the suit jerks him off in combat
[4:13:16] <vulkan_vibes> he's nothing but nerve and metal
[4:13:17] <+paladinstarbuster> Doomguy was John before the troubles
[4:13:20] <niddron> BJ Blaskowits Rips & Tears but he's tired of it, he'll still do it, just tired.
[4:13:26] <derap41> Fucking lol
[4:13:26] <ohmygodiamonfire> He's sane, but boy does he have some PTSD.
[4:13:35] <GHouseduivel> Yeah the Spartan program is not great
[4:13:38] <%brachydios777> @jiggy_snipe Difference is Doomguy went crazy
[4:13:40] <+MaddyCaddy> The jack off thing is not canon

[4:14:45] <%EldritchBee> Ok but just because they dont go into the detail of it jacking you off doesn't mean it doesn't jack you off
[4:14:47] <%Eaglestrike117> I believe the jack off system stuff is believed to be from Halseys journel, though i dont remember it being in there
[4:14:48] <+MaddyCaddy> If you look for the line he screen capped in any of the books, it doesn't exist
[4:14:49] <Jolly_Adventurer> @WoolieVersus Are you thinking about Venom's suit?

[4:16:03] <GHouseduivel> Yet
[4:16:03] <%BisoromiBear> LAME
[4:16:03] <alrobot2014> dril the god
[4:16:04] <derap41> No the Suit jacks you of and fills your butt
[4:16:05] <Axle13j> I WANT TO BELIEVE
[4:16:06] <1MadLadd> classic lmao
[4:16:07] <BinaryShuffle> FeelsBadMan
[4:16:07] <+krabsan> ITS REAL TO ME DAMN IT
[4:16:08] <%EldritchBee> I DONT GIVE A SHIT IT JACKS HIM OFF IN MY HEART
[4:16:08] <%LastHazzerd> damn it Dril, you beautiful bastard
[4:16:09] <+xddddsorandom> DICK BIG IF TRUE
[4:16:10] <skwisgaar451> SO FAKE
[4:16:11] <VestigeOuroboros> It makes you want to though.
[4:16:14] <%a_goth_pancake> big fake
[4:16:14] <$Fortunato5678> Doesn't jack you off. Unless...?
[4:16:16] <vulkan_vibes> DRILLLLL
[4:16:16] <%dinnydanny777> Humans are mega fascists though
[4:16:17] <+LimpBisquicks> it's all fake so I decide what I want to be canon or not
[4:16:17] <derap41> Do you consent Master Chief ?
[4:16:20] <WillyFresh992> FINISH... I MEAN START THE FIGHT
[4:16:20] <+zerosmss> the Spartan IIs canonically have reduced sex drives anyways
[4:16:23] <%brachydios777> But what if though?
[4:16:24] <%tyler274> it literally will though, since Halo 4 introduced NANO MACHINES SON
[4:16:25] <Magoloso> Wait is Woolz playing Halo? The golden age continues?
[4:16:27] <%ChoculaUltra> the suit understands CONSENT
[4:16:28] <GHouseduivel> 8ft tall super solider, but a suit that jacks you off is too far thonk
[4:16:31] <TheChucklingOak> You all just want more options for Cortana and Chief smut
[4:16:45] <%dinnydanny777> But it has deep lore
[4:16:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You mean "Good"
[4:16:49] <%prime_name> non-cod
[4:16:49] <vulkan_vibes> the vaguely cartoony graphics age well
[4:16:49] <+D00msDayDan> these days "arcadey" means "not call of duty"
[4:16:50] <%kyh9> Yeah, exactly
[4:16:53] <%ChoculaUltra> clearly the semen would be used to power the shield batteries...right?
[4:16:57] <%dinnydanny777> But Halo has the deepest dankest lore
[4:16:58] <%Veraverse> What about Halo 6, guys
[4:16:59] <+croxeye> Halo is very slooooooooow
[4:17:03] <%Veraverse> Keepo
[4:17:10] <vulkan_vibes> the cartoon vibe and color palette ages well
[4:17:12] <starlessdan> the semen powers Cortana
[4:17:12] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> I hope this leads to woolie playing some destiny. =)
[4:17:18] <TheChucklingOak> Yeah, Style switching, but with graphics!
[4:17:19] <%LastHazzerd> wait people use "Arcadey" to mean "Video Gaems" ?? all this time i thought they meant high score no plot
[4:17:24] <+Fenrein> But please play through 343 Guilty Spark in OG
[4:17:25] <penitentpentwitch> Old footage AND that nostaglic 30 FPS
[4:17:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> also the remake is 10 years old
[4:17:26] <Explodincatz> the foliage is clutter, everything else looks fine
[4:17:26] <%dinnydanny777> Does Cortana have mass
[4:17:27] <dabeaminator> H2 Anniversary is much more faithful to the original look.
[4:17:28] <derap41> Its way easier to tell what's going on
[4:17:30] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @RatedShadowRiasXrd
[4:17:30] <Halospaz117> The old graphics are home
[4:17:31] <superinuit> $100 for guns, $50 for bullets, $50000 for suit that jacks me off, $80 for grenades. my keyes is starving, please help me spend less.
[4:17:33] <%Totally_Not_Toby> the new graphics are just bad, it's really sad
[4:17:41] <+ActionWords> Yeah you *have* to play through 343 Guilty Spark in classic
[4:17:41] <%Totally_Not_Toby> wish they were better
[4:17:41] <+croxeye> also the new designs are too drab and don't really show you the important enemies and details that you need to see
[4:17:43] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Nope , hologram
[4:17:44] <%kyh9> All the areas were designed with the assumptions of that art style
[4:17:44] <%a_goth_pancake> looks good for 2000
[4:17:47] <%ChoculaUltra> @dinnydanny777 I mean, have you seen those digital child-bearing hips?
[4:17:48] <andrei11dr> Master Chief totally has like 10 inch of limp dick
[4:17:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus Woolie, Lil V, please, PLEASE make sure you only do the current level on OG graphics. There's spooky mood fog that is removed in the uprez graphics
[4:17:55] <+EMFole> The MCC verstion is based off the old gearbox PC port, and the old graphics are actually worse on MCC than they are on the original Halo CE
[4:17:55] <derap41> The Hunter Suit is a really good example
[4:17:59] <%dinnydanny777> Is Cortana just a USB stick
[4:18:06] <%prime_name> yes
[4:18:09] <%dinnydanny777> Just one thicc as heck USB stick
[4:18:10] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Basically
[4:18:14] <TheChucklingOak> I don't get how people don't like the new graphics. It's still so colorful and there's honestly not that much clutter
[4:18:15] <%kyh9> The game feels like a theme park
[4:18:16] <DinoBear_7> The only level I'd really say to really be pick is the next level, which is much better with classic graphics
[4:18:16] <@Solidus_113> Cortana is a SD card
[4:18:24] <+ActionWords> have y'all noticed Cortana gets thiccer during each successive Halo release rooThink
[4:18:30] <+ActionWords> Halo 4 she's DEPENDABLE holy
[4:18:35] <%a_goth_pancake> nah you're just supposed to follow CHIPPS, the real hero of Halo
[4:18:39] <%dinnydanny777> Do you think Cortana notices being plugged in
[4:18:42] <Catpurrple> @WoolieVersus I hope you swap between graphics relatively frequently in 343 guilty spark, there's lots of missing and important tone-setting details in that level that they just didn't add to the new graphics for some reason.
[4:18:44] <+ActionWords> chipps dubbo rooLove
[4:18:45] <%Veraverse> Halo 4 Cortana can step on me
[4:18:45] <%Pyretech> backpack reload is the shit
[4:18:47] <NotHereToStream> animation cancel
[4:18:54] <KingVantq> @ActionWords Halo 4 cortana doodMako
[4:18:56] <+ActionWords> Halo 4 Cortana a whole-ass MEAL rooGasm
[4:19:06] <%Irridium> you can also shoot before the melee animation finishes
[4:19:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:19:09] <slatersev> Halo 4 Cortana is life
[4:19:12] <%Veraverse> Halo 4 Cortana = woolieGASM
[4:19:17] <%brachydios777> Chat getting horney
[4:19:20] <slatersev> she loves Chieg
[4:19:22] <PlasticJake> Halo 4 is ass
[4:19:25] <+ActionWords> Even H2A cortana can't compare
[4:19:29] <+ActionWords> H4 Cortana bemvrOK
[4:19:32] <%RyTYoung> T BAGS
[4:19:34] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Halo 4 Cortana = Kreygasm Halo 5 Cortana = Wutface & DansGame
[4:19:35] <%dinnydanny777> Cortana is a waifu
[4:19:42] <%ChoculaUltra> YES!
[4:19:45] <+ActionWords> Halo 5 cortana bemvrYtho
[4:19:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Halo 4 may be ass but Halo 4 Cortana has dem hips
[4:19:48] <%dinnydanny777> @andrei11dr But she's thicc!
[4:19:54] <Khorneflakes_> well I'd call that instant karma
[4:19:54] <%Veraverse> @andrei11dr IN MY HEART WE CAN
[4:19:54] <+D00msDayDan> @andrei11dr excuse me have you not been paying attention to this forerunner hard light tech
[4:19:56] <Whyverns> hard light holograms are fuckable
[4:19:57] <%Irridium> @andrei11dr not with that attitude you can't
[4:19:57] <GHouseduivel> Multiplayer is fun, but holy shit is it toxic
[4:19:58] <DigitalJoshie> 5 cortana is weird
[4:19:58] <%Veraverse> IN MY SOUL
[4:20:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> BETRAYLO
[4:20:07] <%Retinolgaming> Retinolgaming subscribed at Tier 1.
[4:20:08] <%prime_name> Cortana is not in 5
[4:20:09] <+ActionWords> 4 cortana is like the only thing 4 does right bemvrOK
[4:20:12] <%DemonOfSalt> Combined 90 fps! ;)
[4:20:13] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Halo anime take place before CE
[4:20:15] <%LavenderLaser> can't wait until they get to 2
[4:20:22] <TheChucklingOak> The old Forerunner AIs were supposedly physical enough to engage personally in fights. Like the one who joined the flood and the one who led the last battle fllet
[4:20:26] <dabeaminator> @prime_name That is super wrong
[4:20:29] <Solidnick18> YEAH PAPER MARIO
[4:20:31] <PlasticJake> Halo 4 & 5 started getting this weird Chief x cortana fucky fanfic vibe that was never in the bungie games
[4:20:31] <+ActionWords> @prime_name noone's ever *really* gone rooBlank
[4:20:36] <%Josef_Stryker> For Honor maybe :3
[4:20:38] <slatersev> it super was
[4:20:40] <%munster_zero> I am very hype for more of ttyd
[4:20:43] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Plot twist: Medicant Bias was the AI that helped CHief in Halo 3
[4:20:46] <WanderingSwordsman> Put a betrayal counter in the anime
[4:20:46] <Solidnick18> for honor FeelsGoodMan
[4:20:49] <DigitalJoshie> new era
[4:20:49] <%LastHazzerd> Melee
[4:20:52] <slatersev> the books made that shit canon well before 4
[4:20:53] <TheChucklingOak> halo 4 felt weird only because it was the first to use stuff from the books
[4:20:53] <iamtheTwitchghost> nice lineup
