[0:23:55] <Garnetguy98> I’m shock you can buy equipment for him
[0:23:57] <%rizintaco> rizintaco subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:23:58] <+Huttersson> Or are they just doing comparisons to be helpful if you want to buy stuff for when the party gets back together?
[0:24:29] <leith_aziz> Putting gear in members in old RPGs is stressfull when you dont know when you can risk losing out on it forever when stuff hits the fan cohhHmm

[0:43:09] <lotharrio> My dad sleep walked for a while. It was bizarre.
[0:43:10] <RyuuAoi> Slept walked as a child and peed in a corner.
[0:43:15] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Sleep punching is strong
[0:43:19] <RyuuAoi> They might kill you or something.
[0:43:20] <OldManDeckardCain> bullshit blazing
[0:43:21] <dds333a> I think you've mentioned this before LUL
[0:43:31] <DSD24> I sleepwalk sometimes
[0:43:39] <anachronologist> @Jessie_Lockhart damn right. I dont wake people up for that exact reason
[0:43:39] <%TheBobulus> full Amano at is accessible from the boot menu btw
[0:43:40] <%livlinn> I sleep laugh and sleepYELL woolieEVIL
[0:43:44] <+vaderxyz1970> Its wake up fight or fight response

[0:43:58] <%andre11dr> Sleep walking is kinda creepy
[0:44:04] <RyuuAoi> @livlinn That's real! And kinda scary ha
[0:44:14] <Treasure_Vault> No sleep walking, but sleep paralysis ONCE. Once is enough.
[0:44:23] <anachronologist> sleep walking is just living in liminal space for a short term
[0:44:36] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Maybe sleepwalkers really are in the dream world, an alternate reality to our world? PogChamp
[0:44:42] <alexandrecau> It's actually bad waking them up because they can get really disoriented and start freakign out but it's not like life endangering
[0:44:45] <linSP> WAKE ME UP INSIDE (can’t wake up)

[0:45:00] <anachronologist> @linSP LUL
[0:45:01] <Treasure_Vault> Got sleep paralysis in a car once. Could hear the radio but couldn't move until I got jostled. Really weird.
[0:45:02] <+MyHandsAreBlank> Back row for Celes maybe?
[0:45:04] <+vaderxyz1970> Sleep with a board of nails on your chest to keep away the sleep paralasis demon
[0:45:04] <crimsonharvest> woah they added wallhax?
[0:45:08] <Walterion_> That's another QOL.
[0:45:09] <RyuuAoi> Now they try to blame sleep paralysis when it's actually just excessive use of cocaine.
[0:45:09] <SilverFaustX> they added this transparent cheat?
[0:45:15] <minnesnowdaboy> knxYUH
[0:45:17] <Walterion_> she can punch hard
[0:45:18] <DSD24> Celes got hands
[0:45:18] <Victory_Boss> The government is lying, there is a devil on your chest, paralysis is a hoax
[0:45:18] <%TreeLeafBoi> Devil got a dumpy
[0:45:19] <+pectusumbra> check her magic
[0:45:19] <%andre11dr> Wait so sleep walking is basically being high, but on dream juice
[0:45:20] <brunoberserk> 3 GUYS 1 CHEST
[0:45:21] <+Buttlo> After experiencing sleep paralysis once and then looking up what it was I was like yeah I understand why people thought that shit was demons.
[0:45:26] <%Stormzcales_Lair> Ice
[0:45:27] <dds333a> BOYS
[0:45:28] <+Jessie_Lockhart> OMG. I wish they had that in the OG
[0:45:29] <anachronologist> use magic dude
[0:45:41] <@SoushinSen> genji gloves let's gooo
[0:45:43] <BlackermanZX> years ago i had sleep paralysis at least 2 times a week
[0:45:46] <BlackermanZX> it was horrible
[0:45:46] <RyuuAoi> Yeah they don't like her.
[0:45:58] <kinggum41> I wish they'd HD-2D this game
[0:45:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:45:59] <OblivionSword1> nah punch em to death
[0:46:01] <majindusto> Steal?
[0:46:02] <%TheBobulus> maybe give her your second weapon until you loot one
[0:46:03] <%livlinn> Punch girl prenEff
[0:46:05] <Carlioo> mmmmmMAGIC?!
[0:46:09] <+Buttlo> I get it whenever I try to sleep on my back, I have to sleep on my stomach.
[0:46:12] <hdroark134> is she fliping them while she cast
[0:46:15] <hdroark134> ??
[0:46:16] <+pectusumbra> she's a test tube baby of the empire
[0:46:18] <dds333a> Was that MMMMMAGIC
[0:46:19] <anachronologist> Double magic girl party
[0:46:30] <lotharrio> Steal when there's one enemy left makes a bit more sense.
[0:46:31] <%Stormzcales_Lair> she paladin
[0:46:31] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Shes a Magitek Knight
[0:46:33] <DSD24> @Buttlo I feel that too
[0:46:39] <jaysondeez> don't forget to equip weapons on her
[0:46:43] <%andre11dr> I had sleep paralysis once and all that i saw was a crazy colorful map on the ceiling
[0:46:44] <hdroark134> seems like she put that middle finger while she casts
[0:46:46] <linSP> Runes? Elden ring?
[0:46:58] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Just use that shield
[0:47:03] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Learn Shield Bash
[0:47:16] <pumspreadart> ayo give her a weapon tho
[0:47:17] <+Jiggisnipe> good ol bashing board
[0:47:35] <anachronologist> She's mostly back row support with runic being used as a magic absorber. Shes a good caster
[0:47:36] <linSP> “Hey Locke can I have one of your two knives”
[0:47:37] <%TheBobulus> don't forget map
[0:47:43] <+pupil31> SourPls
[0:47:49] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Borkers!
[0:47:52] <pumspreadart> did they choose locke first ? or did they go with Sabin earlier ?
[0:47:57] <+gitgouda> yo this sprite art looks clean.
[0:47:57] <OblivionSword1> Woolie will not use magic other than cure
[0:47:59] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Locke first
[0:48:01] <JoshuaSXM> just use her magic for dmg
[0:48:04] <pumspreadart> nice
[0:48:09] <NickHatesSnow> She's basically cloud
[0:48:10] <+Jessie_Lockhart> These guys hit hard
[0:48:22] <pumspreadart> woolie " we use items" madden
[0:48:22] <anachronologist> there is litereally no reason not to use magic every turn
[0:48:23] <+pectusumbra> might want to put her in the backrow
[0:48:24] <%Stormzcales_Lair> hopefully sabin last, best for last i always say
[0:48:40] <%Prevot> so that's just a fucking doberman
[0:48:47] <Carlioo> sabin's the longest right?
[0:48:47] <%Sunriser41> @NickHatesSnow more like lighting, but not a bad character
[0:48:53] <BlackermanZX> oh yeah backrow might be useful
[0:48:55] <anachronologist> Its an Empire pooch
[0:49:09] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Wonder if the dogs run away in this version
[0:49:17] <pumspreadart> they do :D
[0:49:22] <NickHatesSnow> @Sunriser41 they're all the same
[0:49:30] <+JefDesenhero> im so glad they kept the animations in this version, from 1 to 5 it was all copy pasted
[0:49:31] <majindusto> PINCER
[0:49:40] <+pectusumbra> correct
[0:49:47] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Well cant run in a pincer attack
[0:49:55] <%StaceMcGate> bitch dog
[0:50:02] <BlackermanZX> bitchmade doggo
[0:50:03] <pumspreadart> IT WAS GONNA DIE REGGIE
[0:50:04] <Estuko> @StaceMcGate I mean, probably
[0:50:13] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Oh they turn after the first hit. Thats a change
[0:50:18] <@SoushinSen> "bitch" dog? so just literal bitch then
[0:50:26] <pumspreadart> Borkers don't WANT to be busted
[0:50:33] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Oh, and they can run in a pincer. Resourceful borkers.
[0:50:33] <lotharrio> Sleeping Bag is your answer, Woolie.
[0:50:37] <NickHatesSnow> does woolie not have a weapon for her?
[0:50:39] <+pectusumbra> Fortunately Celes in particular has an answer to that!
[0:50:46] <+Dakuu75> that's what ether are for, my guy
[0:50:51] <anachronologist> get over those mind goblins. Magic is meant to be USED
[0:50:51] <%Juriasu> you always need mana for the bosses so hold on to taht feeling
[0:50:59] <alexandrecau> no weapon just a heavy shield
[0:51:03] <%Stormzcales_Lair> fine just keep ens/cotages
[0:51:06] <pumspreadart> mind goblins are gonna ruin the playthrough
[0:51:10] <%BestTeaMaker> use tents
[0:51:13] <%xerotwo> Celes is STRONK
[0:51:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> “Oh my god, a sword!” “No! You get the shield!”
[0:51:20] <%Juriasu> there is usually a save space soemwhere inside the dungeon where you can replenish mp with a tent or sleeping bag
[0:51:24] <crimsonharvest> use the sort bro
[0:51:29] <majindusto> ALL FOR CELES
[0:51:34] <+pectusumbra> she can use it
[0:51:37] <lotharrio> Confirm?
[0:51:39] <crimsonharvest> then double tap on a weapon it should show you
[0:51:40] <+Catpurnicus> you totally can
[0:51:44] <NickHatesSnow> Celes uses the heavy shit
[0:51:49] <+Catpurnicus> look at the item description
[0:51:53] <+JefDesenhero> dont worry too much, the game is very forgiving
[0:51:54] <+Jessie_Lockhart> There used to be a way in the OG
[0:51:59] <anachronologist> Watching Woolz adapt to old school RPG mechanics is entertaining
[0:52:02] <+Catpurnicus> did they take that out?
[0:52:07] <crimsonharvest> it would also list out the resistances n shit if it had any
[0:52:10] <+Catpurnicus> it shows you an entire page of details for the item
[0:52:14] <pumspreadart> * sees genji glove on locke
[0:52:31] <%Stormzcales_Lair> Job class logic, too big for a THF, also shop menu is the place he looking for. i think
[0:52:52] <Estuko> I thought someone dm'd me on 14.  the game is not open and I'm doing my school work LUL
[0:52:53] <JoshuaSXM> @pumspreadart its great when you ca mug somebody twice lol
[0:52:59] <crimsonharvest> its like a grounding rod for spells
[0:52:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:53:02] <anachronologist> Runic absorbs magic attacks!
[0:53:08] <%BestTeaMaker> runic is explained later
[0:53:22] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Actually Runic was explained earlier
[0:53:23] <+Catpurnicus> she will absorb ANY magic cast
[0:53:29] <alrobot2014> they also explained it back at the narshe tutorial but that's way too early
[0:53:31] <+JefDesenhero> soon it will be very useful
[0:53:32] <+pectusumbra> until she makes another move
[0:53:34] <Estuko> It's handy, also EXTREMELY helpful in dissidia LUL
[0:53:37] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It was explained in the tutorial area in narshe
[0:53:38] <+Catpurnicus> including by party members
[0:53:40] <Walterion_> In Narshe's school they tell you about it.
[0:53:43] <lotharrio> It's like Defense. As long as she doesn't do another action, she'll maintain that condition.
[0:53:48] <+Jiggisnipe> Runic might have been explained in the tutorial but why would you remember lol
[0:53:50] <anachronologist> You will learn the ways of the Runic
[0:53:58] <+LastHazzerd> it still goes on turn based rules, it's just the turns aren't ordered after one another, they go when the ATB bar fills
[0:54:09] <%TheBobulus> I basically never used Runic in my original playthrough, and it was a real missed opportunity
[0:54:18] <jaysondeez> catch these spells
[0:54:23] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah you got it Reggie
[0:54:32] <+projectmanatees> they always explain party members unique skills
[0:54:38] <AbnormalVoid> oh shit, they actually show you the hidden areas
[0:54:39] <@SoushinSen> never used runic either except a particular moment the tutorial literally asked for it
[0:54:48] <Neoripo> Yeah, Runic was explained once in the tutorial a week ago
[0:55:01] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @abnormalvoid ikr?! Its so cool!
[0:55:03] <%TheBobulus> No spoilers, but there's certain magic-casting bosses it's useful against
[0:55:07] <+Catpurnicus> runic isn't useful that often
[0:55:14] <Walterion_> Yeah Runic can absorb your own spells.
[0:55:15] <TenguGemini> I think it works on monster's magic as well
[0:55:16] <%TheBobulus> and NOT just the tutorial one you're thinking of
[0:55:26] <AbnormalVoid> @Jessie_Lockhart thinking about how much I missed in my first playthroughs lmao
[0:55:27] <+projectmanatees> but remember magiktech is basically the same
[0:55:32] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Earring, time to get strongth
[0:55:35] <+GarouFGC> You'd be surprised whats considered magic in 6. atpMurray
[0:55:37] <anachronologist> The very first-time I touched this game I didnt even understand how to play it I was so young, I just tried running from every fight and didnt understand the level up concept, lol
[0:55:44] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @abnormalvoid exactly :D
[0:55:44] <lotharrio> Its a 25% effect boost.
[0:55:45] <+Catpurnicus> I just noticed there's no separate Relic category lol
[0:55:45] <%TheBobulus> I think it's like 10% or somehting?
[0:55:58] <+JefDesenhero> it's good
[0:56:03] <pumspreadart> aw man what if runic gave celes buffs too ?
[0:56:22] <%Juriasu> darkness more often nut petrification is way worse to get hit with
[0:56:24] <rcand9> is darkness still a broken status element chat?
[0:56:26] <%CaptainBeird> probably not but being petrified is way worse
[0:56:34] <rcand9> in that it doesnt even work
[0:56:35] <+Jessie_Lockhart> She gets MP from the spells she absorbs
[0:56:41] <teg88> @rcand9 No, it works, as does Evasion
[0:56:56] <rcand9> oh thats good they fixed it
[0:57:05] <Neoripo> They fixed the combat system apparently
[0:57:07] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Sad that darkness is no longer an upgrade
[0:57:11] <anachronologist> Someone needs to tell Woolie to keep his casters in the back row
[0:57:12] <AbnormalVoid> SourPls
[0:57:24] <%Sunriser41> so no more vanish +xzone?
[0:57:35] <pumspreadart> Is it just me or are there way more back attacks and side attacks in this version ?
[0:57:40] <+sssoapy> LOL
[0:57:40] <%xerotwo> LUL
[0:57:41] <+pectusumbra> @anachronologist celes can swing and tank hits though now that she's got gear. She wears heavier stuff than locke
[0:57:42] <anachronologist> that was out many editions ago
[0:57:42] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:57:43] <rcand9> lol

[0:57:58] <KeiPrime> well side attack was new in this one, so they probably wanted to show it off more

[0:57:59] <AbnormalVoid> she's a Traitor AGAIN

[0:58:13] <alrobot2014> its okay woolie i cast fire on my whole party multiple times yesterday
[0:58:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It was a work the whole time
[0:58:18] <anachronologist> @anachronologist good point actually. its just still botherinng me from his use of Terra
[0:58:19] <+LastHazzerd> screen based, not target based
[0:58:24] <pumspreadart> actually, this is a good learning moment for woolie, you can cast cure on enemies
[0:58:25] <+Dakuu75> frigin stream raid got muted? lol-wut?
[0:58:28] <Teradyne87> You can also press the d-pad towards the edge of the screen to target all
[0:58:40] <BoneofMalkav> Yeah iirc it was like that on the SNES
[0:58:43] <%Stormzcales_Lair> it was just D pad back in the day
[0:58:43] <+Rinvelo> rinvel1RAID  Rinvelo Raiders Charge!!!  rinvel1RAID
[0:58:47] <BlackermanZX> is Celes on the back row
[0:58:55] <lotharrio> @anachronologist I mean, if nothing else, it would save him MP on healing magic.
[0:59:00] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yes Dpad was how you picked all
[0:59:03] <anachronologist> actually she would still be better in the back row so she takes less damage
[0:59:11] <pumspreadart> ether up
[0:59:30] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I mean she’s fine front row or back row
[0:59:38] <TenguGemini> are the items... unsorted?
[0:59:45] <crimsonharvest> you want the secret chest?
[0:59:46] <%townzzzzz> X potion or cross potion

[1:00:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:00:00] <anachronologist> just like the good old days with the bottomless box
[1:00:00] <+JefDesenhero> whaaaat
[1:00:03] <BlackermanZX> amazing
[1:00:07] <Teradyne87> First ribbon, here we go
[1:00:09] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Ribbon!
[1:00:09] <+GarouFGC> I dunno, I Keep Celes in the front early game while MP is still limited and use her as a tank with spells as opposed as a caster that can tank.
[1:00:11] <+BlackMageMog> Or would that be a Chi-potion?
[1:00:12] <pumspreadart> oh don't use an x-potion but use the elixir tho ? i see how it is
[1:00:13] <TenguGemini> has that always been there?
[1:00:15] <majindusto> EARLY RIBBON enigmaPOG
[1:00:15] <+JefDesenhero> didn't know that
[1:00:17] <BlackermanZX> still broken as fuck
[1:00:17] <+hoenhime344> im watching woolies ffx playthrough. my god this is so good
[1:00:18] <zenith0111> Ribbon is da best
[1:00:36] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Ribbon this early is poweful
[1:00:37] <NickHatesSnow> x potions are rare but easy to get late, exilars are the never use
[1:00:43] <anachronologist> YES THANKS
[1:00:44] <+sssoapy> thank god
[1:00:44] <Walterion_> now it is sorted
[1:00:51] <anachronologist> Love you Woolz
[1:00:59] <TenguGemini> I legitimately had no idea you could get a ribbon this early
[1:01:02] <pumspreadart> cant wait till they get to sabin tho
[1:01:08] <TenguGemini> seriously, wtf
[1:01:16] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Whens FF version of attache case?
[1:01:24] <anachronologist> Yeah, the Sabin/Shadow part is fun as heck
[1:01:27] <+pectusumbra> honestly we might get through all the chapters today? I don't remember them being super long
[1:01:42] <+JefDesenhero> i remember ribbon and some shield kinda making you invincible in the snes version
[1:01:45] <+Jiggisnipe> one is much longer than the others
[1:01:52] <KeiPrime> sabin's is pretty lengthy but terra's is very short
[1:02:15] <+Catpurnicus> yeah sabin is probably the longest
[1:02:18] <%TheBobulus> Woolie, I believe if you're *in* a secret passage when you open the map, it'll show all the secret passages on screen
[1:02:35] <pumspreadart> with how woolie is playing i think they're going to enjoy the next bit with the shadow
[1:02:35] <ludov06> gosh this is such a nostalgia trip so far.  especially watching the first episode on YouTube this morning
[1:02:54] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I still need to watch ep4
[1:02:59] <ludov06> I just can't wait for the but with Sabin
[1:03:06] <pumspreadart> it feels so good when evasion actually works
[1:03:13] <BlackermanZX> is she flippin us off
[1:03:21] <+Jessie_Lockhart> And looking forward to the episodes that cover everything else before this
[1:03:24] <anachronologist> The Sabin side story is the longest one as well.
[1:03:28] <%Juriasu> 👆
[1:03:29] <hdroark134> EXACTLY
[1:03:31] <RyuuAoi> Fuck ya life!
[1:03:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yoooo 8-Bit Theatre!
[1:03:35] <%CaptainBeird> god i loved 8 bit theater
[1:03:35] <hdroark134> middle finger
[1:03:40] <hdroark134> sorry forr the caps xp
[1:03:44] <+Jessie_Lockhart> OMG I was dying on ep3. The banter was top tier.
[1:03:54] <anachronologist> 8-bit Theater oh yeah
[1:04:08] <SilverFaustX> can u turn that cheat off?
[1:04:32] <%TueDuffCity> @SilverFaustX What cheat?
[1:04:37] <+SolidusRex> When are we getting a Sword-Chucks job for FFXIV?
[1:04:39] <SilverFaustX> see tru walls
[1:04:39] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I havent read an 8-Bit theater in maybe a decade. Is it even still going?
[1:04:50] <%TheBobulus> nah, it ended like a decade ago
[1:04:50] <+pectusumbra> Ended ages ago
[1:04:52] <@SoushinSen> i suppose technically, it's cheating, but who the hell cares?
[1:05:07] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Ah thanks
[1:05:09] <%TueDuffCity> Idk if i would see that as cheating
[1:05:09] <+pectusumbra> hold l and r
[1:05:15] <pumspreadart> buster those borkers
[1:05:19] <RyuuAoi> No flee. XP
[1:05:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> i want to make a joke about Poisona and Persona but i'm lacking a good punchline
[1:05:32] <%TheBobulus> spekaing of 8-bit theater, they just finished a kickstarter for a published version of the comic. Except because all the art is (c) square-enix, the book is going to be scripts only :D
[1:05:33] <+Jessie_Lockhart> No retreat! No surrender!
[1:05:41] <+SolidusRex> 8-bit Theater ended with the longest punchline set-up in webcomic history
[1:05:53] <KeiPrime> if its in the game with no obtuse means, its not cheating
[1:05:59] <RyuuAoi> @sverisageadvice This LP is proving that Persona 2 can be done.
[1:06:06] <+pectusumbra> generally your magic won't miss
[1:06:09] <%TheBobulus> there's evasion and magic evasion
[1:06:10] <@SoushinSen> magic doesn't miss, right?
[1:06:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh i got it "mom i wanna play Persona" "we got Poisona at home"
[1:06:17] <Walterion_> Magic doesn't miss
[1:06:18] <lotharrio> Each spell has its own accuracy rating. It's high enough that missing isn't something to worry about.
[1:06:23] <KeiPrime> magic misses, like instant death
[1:06:24] <pumspreadart> check the besitary later
[1:06:26] <%TheBobulus> usually magic evasion is really low, I think
[1:06:31] <Teradyne87> Magic evasion is for status effects
[1:06:32] <@SoushinSen> oh right, instant death
[1:06:33] <+GarouFGC> Magic never misses unless the target is under certain special statuses.
[1:06:38] <alrobot2014> you have magical evasion but the enemy usually has very litttle iirc
[1:06:38] <%CaptainBeird> @solidusrex that payoff was gold
[1:06:47] <teg88> Magic can't be dodged, but it CAN be blocked
[1:06:49] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @ryuuaoi I’d love to see them play P2, especially Innocent Sin since I’ve never seen it
[1:06:51] <Walterion_> yeah with the exception of instant death/ status inflict attacks
[1:06:56] <KeiPrime> invisuble drops magic evade to 0
[1:06:59] <@SoushinSen> damn, reggie's delivery on "i'm helping you because i want to" sounded so angry
[1:07:11] <pumspreadart> damn reggie ok jeez
[1:07:11] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[1:07:14] <alexandrecau> Locke helps every magical girl that defected the empire, that's just the right hing to do
[1:07:25] <Walterion_> Chest count and everything, damn
[1:07:26] <%oneimportantthing> Reggie has serious voice acting talent, I kind of want to see him doing professional VA work
[1:07:27] <wanderingdain90> ohh that's nice
[1:07:27] <alphalejandro> Chat, i have to leave for a moment, so i miss Celes' rescue, the "SCENE" was here or was censored
[1:07:28] <zenith0111> I love sprite era FF games
[1:07:31] <+JefDesenhero> you can sleep in the house up there
[1:07:33] <lotharrio> See that Chest an Item list?
[1:07:35] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Locke a bigger simp than Edgar
[1:07:48] <ludov06> oh heck world map <3
[1:07:51] <pumspreadart> But Egdar gets maidens
[1:07:53] <anachronologist> @Jessie_Lockhart I just beat innocent Sin recently it was pretty good. Stiil have to play EP tho
[1:07:56] <+pectusumbra> yeah, have to get to Narshe
[1:07:59] <alphalejandro> @Jessie_Lockhart More than you think
[1:08:03] <RyuuAoi> @jessie_lockhart Persona (PSP), P2: Innocent Sin, and P2: Eternal Punishment dream LPs
[1:08:14] <@SoushinSen> Edgar's a ladies man, but locke is the real definition of simp.
[1:08:16] <pumspreadart> e
[1:08:20] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @anachronologist EP is really good
[1:08:25] <%TheBobulus> I love how the geography actually makes sense-ish
[1:08:28] <brunoberserk> i remember in suikoden , if you character is really bad with magic , the magic can explode in your face , and you takes damage , sometimesthe whole party can take damage LUL
[1:08:37] <pumspreadart> enemy crabs
[1:08:41] <%TheBobulus> almost out of mp
[1:08:41] <RyuuAoi> @anachronologist Beat Innocent Sin. Eternal Punishment got me locked tf down rn
[1:08:49] <anachronologist> @brunoberserk YIS. Love Suikoden
[1:09:02] <+JefDesenhero> that noise
[1:09:05] <@SoushinSen> love the cave music
[1:09:06] <%TheBobulus> plot progression advances enemy level
[1:09:12] <pumspreadart> its not like ff8 where all enemies level up with you
[1:09:13] <%TheBobulus> / enemy type
[1:09:14] <Teradyne87> Special chest you left unopened here
[1:09:15] <+pectusumbra> man I don't remember how to get the thunder rod to break this
[1:09:27] <+pectusumbra> ahh maybe that was it
[1:09:39] <pumspreadart> maybe they should leave those chests closed for a later date
[1:09:45] <Teradyne87> Do it now
[1:09:45] <pumspreadart> wait longer
[1:09:45] <+projectmanatees> Longer
[1:09:48] <Walterion_> Wait longer
[1:09:51] <pumspreadart> much longer
[1:09:52] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @pectusumbra you use it as an item
[1:09:54] <AbnormalVoid> Remember that the walls in this game are pseudo-3D, meaning you can stand behind walls, there are a lot of secrets hidden this way
[1:09:54] <%TheBobulus> I'd say wait longer
[1:09:55] <wanderingdain90> wait real longer
[1:09:56] <lotharrio> You can do it now, I'd say waite.
[1:09:58] <anachronologist> you're gonna wait a while on those chests brah
[1:10:12] <ThanosGlenn> YOOOO I used to crank it to General Snow all the time! Poggers!!!!
[1:10:16] <linSP> Don’t check reggie!
[1:10:20] <alrobot2014> i think you'll know it when it happens
[1:10:22] <muerphy> Sweet FF fan merch at my shop segment.click
[1:10:23] <anachronologist> They're not going anywhere anytime soon
[1:10:25] <%TheBobulus> don't forget there's a healing spring near the exit
[1:10:27] <linSP> It’s WAY later
[1:10:31] <%Stormzcales_Lair> oh noo
[1:10:40] <Teradyne87> Top left
[1:11:08] <anachronologist> Steve Irwin Killers
[1:11:19] <+Jessie_Lockhart> What was that sound chat?! pieS
[1:11:21] <AbnormalVoid> pay the cartagra fee
[1:11:38] <%AlteisenReiseZ> lol it's a VN
[1:11:40] <%oneimportantthing> My best friend listened to this specific track a lot when his mom died. Holds so much weight. Really beautiful.
[1:11:43] <Teradyne87> @AbnormalVoid That pun gave me spleen tearing
[1:11:44] <%TheBobulus> healing spring, plz
[1:11:46] <%Stormzcales_Lair> drink water
[1:11:49] <pumspreadart> sweet baby turtle
[1:11:55] <+pectusumbra> oh yeah isn't that a healing spring
[1:11:57] <OblivionSword1> and he turned away
[1:11:58] <AbnormalVoid> @AbnormalVoid good Kappa
[1:12:01] <pumspreadart> GOLD DUST
[1:12:06] <anachronologist> its a damn good OST
[1:12:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @oneimportantthing there’s so much great music in this
[1:12:14] <anachronologist> Ingrained in the brain
[1:12:17] <rcand9> trying to rob a bear
[1:12:20] <Walterion_> Stopped hard
[1:12:24] <OblivionSword1> uh oh
[1:12:26] <Afroperonista> be wary of bear
[1:12:26] <%TheBobulus> slow, I think?
[1:12:29] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Burr
[1:12:31] <%edgeroth> first a bear in elden ring now a bear in ff6
[1:12:32] <+pectusumbra> stop
[1:12:32] <brunoberserk> super saiyan bear
[1:12:34] <pumspreadart> Lots of bears this week
[1:12:35] <%TheBobulus> or stop, actually
[1:12:35] <+JefDesenhero> locke really is a treasure hunter, he's a terrible thief lol
[1:12:42] <Teradyne87> Pink is stop, yeah
[1:12:44] <anachronologist> Who pickpockets a bear!? Locke Cole, that's who!
[1:12:45] <someweeb95> wow that's rough
[1:12:47] <%TheBobulus> no item for stop
[1:12:52] <pumspreadart> naw get dunked on
[1:12:52] <@SoushinSen> nope
[1:12:57] <pumspreadart> wait it out
[1:13:03] <+Jessie_Lockhart> No cure for it rn
[1:13:04] <%TheBobulus> just gotta wait for it to wear off
[1:13:05] <Teradyne87> You'd have to cast haste on her to end it prematurely
[1:13:10] <pumspreadart> how fast can you move in the stopped time
[1:13:17] <%Juriasu> stop is not a ailment
[1:13:24] <rasamune> Dead enemies don't deal damage bro
[1:13:26] <pumspreadart> ribbons cant stop time
[1:13:32] <+pectusumbra> it'll restore your MP
[1:13:35] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Slow and Stop dont count iirc
[1:14:13] <alphalejandro> In this game/univerese, random water is a good thing
[1:14:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:14:14] <pumspreadart> MUCH longer
[1:14:24] <+pectusumbra> sure
[1:14:31] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The longest time
[1:14:33] <OblivionSword1> let's  do it
[1:14:38] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Turtle, therefore dog
[1:14:44] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Save scum. I love it!
[1:14:47] <Teradyne87> I grabbed it at this time because I don't give a damn
[1:14:56] <+Jiggisnipe> woah
[1:14:57] <Walterion_> Actually Auto save too, jesus
[1:15:02] <wanderingdain90> nice
[1:15:04] <OblivionSword1> there's an autosave ?
[1:15:05] <alrobot2014> yeah every room you enter autosaves
[1:15:06] <someweeb95> sick
[1:15:06] <%mr_sups> QoL
[1:15:07] <+pectusumbra> It's a GOOD Game
[1:15:08] <pumspreadart> i hope we get dlc
[1:15:10] <ChristopherWPoindexter> shyyPog
[1:15:11] <%TheBobulus> I believe autosave is done when you enter new rooms
[1:15:11] <anachronologist> The ORIGINAL warm soft trade raven
[1:15:13] <%cache_22> ABS: Always be saving
[1:15:14] <%mr_sups> Get that Quol
[1:15:15] <+Jessie_Lockhart> damn nice
[1:15:28] <alrobot2014> and thank fuck for that because Lvl 5 death is a bitch move to get reset by
[1:15:30] <pumspreadart> takes abit to load
[1:15:37] <Teradyne87> Load time
[1:15:43] <pumspreadart> no bug, just loading
[1:15:48] <+pectusumbra> Aka speedrunner paradise
[1:15:49] <%Juriasu> quick saves are nuts too, even if you get a game over you can still reload the quick save, you'd think it was more of a suspend feature
[1:15:49] <anachronologist> NAH, leave it
[1:16:06] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Thunder! Thunder! Thunder Rod! Ho!
[1:16:12] <+Catpurnicus> its a consumable item
[1:16:12] <pumspreadart> reload the save
[1:16:13] <%TheBobulus> If you end up Loading, might want to check out the Amano art from the boot menu
[1:16:14] <anachronologist> It might turn into something better if you leave it
[1:16:18] <%pugszerosugar> And we can’t get roll back in Tekken
[1:16:30] <%Juriasu> is some of the older games you get items that can cast infinite magic without spending mp
[1:16:32] <alphalejandro> LV1 Thunder, LV2 Thundara, LV3 Thundaga
[1:16:33] <rasamune> These rods are great in FF5 because you can buy them in shops
[1:16:43] <%Anaguma_no_Koe> Thundara aint that great imo
[1:16:47] <+Catpurnicus> you can just buy those rods in shops
[1:16:56] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It better than anything else he got rn
[1:16:56] <@SoushinSen> not a fan of thundara anyways
[1:16:58] <wanderingdain90> also free thundra
[1:16:59] <lotharrio> You can just buy this thing.
[1:17:01] <%StaceMcGate> invest Woolie, hold off and wait for better reward
[1:17:02] <OblivionSword1> what is it even ?
[1:17:06] <+Catpurnicus> he can cast thundara ONCE
[1:17:13] <+Catpurnicus> then it breaks
[1:17:13] <RyuuAoi> Dance, Reggie! Dance!
[1:17:16] <+pectusumbra> @Anaguma_no_Koe In this game these rods are used in like low level speed runs and such
[1:17:20] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Oh as a name? Yeah Thundara aint great
[1:17:20] <anachronologist> Hold off for a better cookie tomorrow
[1:17:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Thats only if its used as an item tho
[1:17:22] <+Jiggisnipe> read the description again
[1:17:25] <AbnormalVoid> I think any of the items are infinitely reproducible, iirc
[1:17:27] <%StaceMcGate> it casts thundara once Woolie then it breaks
[1:17:28] <+Catpurnicus> unless its used as a weapon then it sometimes casts on a hit
[1:17:33] <+pectusumbra> @Catpurnicus it casts at random on attacks and doesn't break
[1:17:36] <+Jiggisnipe> once
[1:17:38] <NickHatesSnow> He cast it once if used as an item, it has a random chance as a weapon to di it forever
[1:17:39] <ChristopherWPoindexter> Oh, sick, they got the original Japanese PlayStation controls here where Circle acts more like an A/Accept button!
[1:17:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> If its used as a weapon its fine it doesnt break
[1:17:41] <pumspreadart> you can get both in different ways
[1:17:44] <+Jiggisnipe> it's a consumable
[1:17:47] <+sssoapy> it breaks bro
[1:17:52] <pumspreadart> it breaks
[1:17:58] <alphalejandro> No, it's gonna break
[1:18:08] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Kinda like a crit
[1:18:08] <pumspreadart> no one
[1:18:09] <KeiPrime> you can change the confirm button if you like
[1:18:12] <Teradyne87> That's the rub
[1:18:13] <anachronologist> RE LOAD
[1:18:13] <ludov06> random comment but I wanted to say I really love how well we can still hear the music in these game stream even with people talking
[1:18:16] <+Catpurnicus> it lets anyone use it as an item (once)
[1:18:16] <pumspreadart> relaod
[1:18:19] <alphalejandro> It's an ITEM
[1:18:19] <Teradyne87> No one to use it for a while
[1:18:20] <lotharrio> It ignores defense when you break it, which makes it really strong.
[1:18:21] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Reasons
[1:18:21] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @keiprime i figured tobsNICE
[1:18:21] <pumspreadart> reload*
[1:18:24] <AbnormalVoid> you can skip the next boss with it lol
[1:18:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> it only breaks if you use it as an item, but theres a chance you get a free thundara when you attacl and it doesnt break?
[1:18:33] <pumspreadart> no actually
[1:18:35] <NickHatesSnow> It's an weapon and item chat read the description
[1:18:36] <ChristopherWPoindexter> tobsLuv nihmunHeart
[1:18:37] <+Catpurnicus> welcome to the consumable spell item system in VI
[1:18:46] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It never breaks when used as a weapon
[1:18:55] <Teradyne87> It's like 3 or so party members from now
[1:18:56] <+pectusumbra> Can Terra use it?
[1:19:14] <AbnormalVoid> You can buy a ton of them later, and using Thundara early is godly
[1:19:14] <%Juriasu> mind goblins BEGONE
[1:19:16] <Kitsunerasu> holding rods/staffs also increase your magic stat so letting a magic user just hold them is beneficial like that too
[1:19:17] <ludov06> there's been streams and let's play wthe the game volume is so low compared to commentary that the music or character dialogues can be barely heard
[1:19:22] <anachronologist> alright, we're moving on
[1:19:22] <pumspreadart> these mind goblins are STRONG
[1:19:25] <%CaptainBeird> surrounded! by one enemie
[1:19:26] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Mind goblins are the worst goblins
[1:19:28] <%Sunriser41> the game is easy enough that it doesnt really matter
[1:19:33] <rasamune> just crack it on a robot's head or something lmao
[1:19:46] <%CaptainBeird> oh that bear really melds into the wall
[1:19:52] <pumspreadart> Time for a deforestation
[1:20:06] <lotharrio> The thing you're giving up, is way more valuable than the thing you've picked up
[1:20:16] <+projectmanatees> aw they aint waiting for the item bepSad
[1:20:18] <AbnormalVoid> by the time you can get a party member that uses it, he's better for other stuff anyway
[1:20:27] <+Catpurnicus> yeah I think reggie is thinking about a different item
[1:20:33] <rasamune> What are they even talking about, I'm lost
[1:20:34] <pumspreadart> naw its fine, hes with the goblins now
[1:20:35] <+Catpurnicus> no reason to keep the rod right now
[1:20:49] <NickHatesSnow> tbh you'll get so much crazy stuff you're gonna be fine no matter what you do
[1:20:52] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie should like up the items you can get before making a decision
[1:20:55] <RyuuAoi> woolieDATTEBAYO psaGoblin woolieDATTEBAYO psaGoblin woolieDATTEBAYO psaGoblin woolieDATTEBAYO psaGoblin
[1:20:56] <pumspreadart> let him keep it, its fine
[1:21:01] <AbnormalVoid> this game is so easy, no point minmaxing lmao
[1:21:20] <+JefDesenhero> I'm 7 hours in, and I think they reajusted the difficulty. it's kinda harder
[1:21:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:21:22] <@SoushinSen> better be ignorant and not knowing about this timed chest at this point

[1:26:09] <BlackermanZX> Dio outfit
[1:26:11] <%Prevot> why she dressed like Dio
[1:26:11] <StillJustARatInACage> afaik Nomura did the designs for the in-game sprites
[1:26:12] <%ozzrabbit> …yep… that’s a proto-Thankred
[1:26:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> PANTS?! What is this bs
[1:26:19] <alphalejandro> Amano's art never resemble the games spritrs

[1:26:30] <%AngryAsian5> DAMN
[1:26:32] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[1:26:32] <+pectusumbra> I mean Amano's art is concept art
[1:26:33] <alrobot2014> that auto crossbow looks nice
[1:26:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CHAD EDGAR
[1:26:41] <KeiPrime> kazuko shibuya did the pixel art
[1:26:42] <Doodle_Taco> Edgar looking fresh
[1:26:42] <iacus_> lol
[1:26:43] <BlackermanZX> Egar looks kinda the same
[1:26:44] <artoflec> that one is so badass

[1:26:45] <Carlioo> damn amaro is so good
[1:26:45] <%Stormzcales_Lair> Mobile portrait mod
[1:26:47] <brunoberserk> holy shit , celes IS the waifu of this game , she is beautiful
[1:26:48] <%Sunriser41> this game deserves a full on 3d remake
[1:26:48] <rcand9> hey i love the sprites
[1:26:49] <+Dakuu75> Edgar's sprite doesn't do him jsutice. lol
[1:26:49] <+Jiggisnipe> oh is that the auto crossbow>
[1:26:50] <Garnetguy98> Edgar looking clean
[1:26:57] <KeiPrime> that FF Dot art book is pretty awesome if you wanna see the sprite work
[1:26:57] <pumspreadart> Edgar Chafking Figaro
[1:27:03] <pumspreadart> chadking*
[1:27:05] <+Jiggisnipe> yea but these sprites are very limited
[1:27:06] <+TheOddJik> ff6 remake would be NUT
[1:27:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Amaro uses water color to make these?
[1:27:07] <KobeTeeth90> FF6 REMAKE WEHN
[1:27:11] <+Jessie_Lockhart> This is why I want to see this game remade with modern gfx
[1:27:11] <RyuuAoi> Wrong characters got in SMASH for sure.
[1:27:15] <alphalejandro> Nomura's art i WAY more simple than Amano's
[1:27:15] <artoflec> yeah terra looks fantastic in dissidia
[1:27:16] <+Aeoneth> Edgaroni Edgaroni, always being the Chadaroni
[1:27:16] <alrobot2014> iirc some of these characters were nomura as well?
[1:27:16] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Correct
[1:27:23] <+SargentToughie> Dissidia uses the Amano art, yes
[1:27:23] <NickHatesSnow> Dissidia is exactly the art
[1:27:24] <BlackermanZX> theres like 3 versions of Terra
[1:27:24] <+Catpurnicus> nope this is all we VI fans get
[1:27:25] <+JefDesenhero> ff6 remake with this art director would be beautiful
[1:27:26] <majindusto> Yes
[1:27:33] <%ozzrabbit> …did they use Edgar’s pictures as inspiration for Paladin Artifact Armor in XIV?
[1:27:33] <%TheBobulus> wasn't there some ff6 in the kingdom hearts games? I don't remember
[1:27:35] <+Catpurnicus> I'm kinda fine with it really
[1:27:38] <Estuko> Yeah Dissidia goes by the artwork, looks fantastic. Opera Omnia has everyone in their artwork outfits
[1:27:40] <definitelynotjayy> whoah elden ring looks great, what is woolie running this on ??
[1:27:42] <OblivionSword1> FFXIV have proper 3D version Amano art
[1:27:46] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:27:49] <Garnetguy98> This is why I’m hoping for a 6 remake
[1:27:51] <Teradyne87> @alrobot2014 Nomura designed Shadow and Setzer
[1:27:51] <KeiPrime> setzer is in kingdom hearts 2, thats about it
[1:27:51] <+Jiggisnipe> look at that smug
[1:27:53] <brunoberserk> dissidia is the closest , but they are basically a mix of amano and nomura
[1:27:54] <LuminusVows> Straight up Chad pose
[1:27:56] <StillJustARatInACage> beard
[1:27:59] <+Kyma1020> Yeah 14 captured Amano's style well
[1:27:59] <Carlioo> guile!
[1:28:00] <+rasend0ri> yup Exactly right Woolie
[1:28:00] <Doodle_Taco> Guile man
[1:28:01] <rcand9> MEAT
[1:28:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Lt. Surge
[1:28:02] <%TheBobulus> didn't expect the beard
[1:28:02] <anachronologist> I dont want an FFVI remake, just leave it where it is
[1:28:03] <+Catpurnicus> if they remade it in 3D, they'd probably use blonde terra from dissidia anyway
[1:28:04] <+PrinceDevian> FamilyMan
[1:28:06] <Walterion_> He has a beard too
[1:28:07] <+Jiggisnipe> with a beard tho
[1:28:11] <+Jiggisnipe> sometimes
[1:28:13] <+polothegreatest> plaguePog
[1:28:13] <BlackermanZX> they cant never decide if canon terra has green or blonde hair
[1:28:14] <%AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:28:15] <+sssoapy> who dat
[1:28:15] <AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:28:16] <Doodle_Taco> oh no
[1:28:17] <+Bitscreed> LUL
[1:28:19] <%mr_sups> He's FF Guile
[1:28:20] <alrobot2014> we will get to the others soon enough
[1:28:20] <wanderingdain90> you're dine
[1:28:21] <%Glock3bb> They actually made the sprites first for this game, then Amano interpreted them.
[1:28:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:28:21] <OldManDeckardCain> cyan WHO
[1:28:25] <pumspreadart> Bestiary
[1:28:27] <OblivionSword1> Omega and the Warrior of light is in XIV is pretty spot on to Amano art
[1:28:27] <+PrinceDevian> Shadow?
[1:28:27] <%AngryAsian5> WHO DAT? LUL
[1:28:30] <linSP> WHO
[1:28:30] <KobeTeeth90> whooo
[1:28:32] <+LazyAss24Seven> Whooooo
[1:28:36] <anachronologist> Terra is Green Hair for life
[1:28:36] <johnjohnmajima> beastiality
[1:28:37] <+LazyAss24Seven> nliAhhh nliAhhh nliAhhh
[1:28:38] <+JefDesenhero> green hair Terra is the real one
[1:28:39] <%TheBobulus> banon MIGHT be in there near the bottom, don't remember
[1:28:42] <AbnormalVoid> it's JUST character portraits LUL
[1:28:43] <alphalejandro> Like, in Dissia  all of the characters from FF1 to FF6 look so differente from the rest of the characters from FF7 onwards
[1:28:44] <+pectusumbra> yeah
[1:28:45] <majindusto> Opera Omnia has them all
[1:28:56] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I prefer green hair since both Celes and Relm are blondes, plus it just looks better on Terra than blonde
[1:29:02] <lotharrio> 1/16 I think?
[1:29:08] <+pectusumbra> Robots weak to lightning
[1:29:14] <anachronologist> @Jessie_Lockhart indeed
[1:29:17] <Estuko> Opera Omnia is pulling in EVERY FF character lmao, we got movie and side games.
[1:29:18] <NickHatesSnow> Yeah Machines are weak to thunder
[1:29:22] <+Catpurnicus> yeah the rod is the RE4 RPG shortcut on the boss
[1:29:22] <pumspreadart> no no small chance of big damage but taking defense and mag defense into account
[1:29:30] <BlackermanZX> I agree that Green Terra is the superior one kolSLURP
[1:29:33] <AbnormalVoid> lighting and water, I think, but water might just be a weakness in the mod I played LUL
[1:30:02] <pumspreadart> green hair terra is great
[1:30:03] <%StaceMcGate> is that the Tell sound from FF14 lol
[1:30:07] <pumspreadart> AIGHT
[1:30:09] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:30:11] <anachronologist> It also works for her as a character, without spoiling anything, if you know...
[1:30:12] <%Bread_Assassin> Can someone just whisper me, what the big item that they are holding off on opening that chest for is.
[1:30:13] <pumspreadart> HONEST FIGHT TIME
[1:30:16] <+Jiggisnipe> Sprites are limited lol
[1:30:16] <Carlioo> the sprite artist reall tried
[1:30:17] <%TheBobulus> only other thing to know about runic is that it only works with SOME of hte weapons. Like, if you give her a whip, it doesn't work
[1:30:23] <brunoberserk> THEY TRYING
[1:30:24] <majindusto> Green Hair Terra is the TRUE DESIGN...Any game  that doesn't  use it or have it as an option  are lesser for it
[1:30:30] <pumspreadart> only with swords
[1:30:31] <NickHatesSnow> Celes has a cape
[1:30:35] <%agoaj> They're the Live Action Netflix adaptation of the Amano art.
[1:30:40] <anachronologist> Runic is only with swords I believe
[1:30:42] <+Catpurnicus> shoutout to the cover of Chrono Trigger with marle casting fire dual techs
[1:30:49] <nintega010> only way I'll play an ff6 remake is if it gets the ff7 remake treatment

[1:35:32] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Once you chose a new action, Runic is no longer procked
[1:35:32] <+pectusumbra> might put celes in back
[1:35:35] <+hoenhime344> sooooo ant chance we can get a FFX-2 LP?
[1:35:37] <anachronologist> Put CELES in back row
[1:35:39] <johnjohnmajima> runic will absorb poison right?

[1:35:47] <anachronologist> NO dammit no
[1:35:49] <lotharrio> @johnjohnmajima Yeah

[1:35:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Just reflect the Thunder it doesn't always shoot, easy Kappa

[2:16:00] <+Catpurnicus> shadow is the true "PAY ME" character, even you even pay per attack
[2:16:02] <TheNix> You definitely don't need 99 of them. But it's not a bad idea either
[2:16:05] <pumspreadart> that was but a TASTE

[2:17:21] <Teradyne87> Aepyornis looks like a Skeksis from Dark Crystal

[2:18:57] <pumspreadart> lol
[2:19:05] <+Jessie_Lockhart> When I saw the command prompts in the trailer I marked out. Its such a good addition.
[2:19:06] <AbnormalVoid> magic attacks remove invisible
[2:19:08] <crimsonharvest> its when you get hit with magic
[2:19:08] <alrobot2014> until you get hit by magic
[2:19:10] <anachronologist> Double invisible!
[2:19:11] <Teradyne87> When he gets hit by a spell it will wear off
[2:19:13] <Doodle_Taco> After a spell hits you
[2:19:14] <agadejobi> Until you get hit by magic
[2:19:14] <lotharrio> When you sleep or until hit by magic
[2:19:15] <$SilverRoddo> Throwing stars never lets you down dskoopaResurface dskoopaResurface dskoopaResurface
[2:19:26] <crimsonharvest> annoyingly, this is the kind of thing you can only see in the manual
[2:19:28] <alrobot2014> it sure is
[2:19:30] <AbnormalVoid> it's OP for now Kappa
[2:19:31] <+pectusumbra> BUT the magic will HURT
[2:19:37] <crimsonharvest> on the other hand magic cannot miss invisible targets
[2:19:39] <TenguGemini> how strong is his regular attack though?
[2:19:42] <DXLelouch24> which is why Reggie better be on his A game CHAT
[2:19:44] <%ChillaxingJay> Sadow is a beast
[2:19:45] <AbnormalVoid> eventually everything starts using magic
[2:19:53] <AntiGulp> Shadow rules

[2:20:23] <agadejobi> This version should have had voice acting
[2:20:24] <TenguGemini> yeah shadow is legit one of the best party members in this game
[2:20:29] <Teradyne87> However, it drops your magic evasion to zero, so magic is more dangerous to invisible characters
[2:20:34] <pumspreadart> just don't leave him
[2:20:35] <+BDazl> Death is Real 2401

[2:26:24] <+Catpurnicus> REGGIE TALK ABOUT QUADRA SLAM

[2:26:24] <crimsonharvest> werent they just numbered
[2:26:26] <pumspreadart> ITS LIKE REGGIE KNEW
[2:26:28] <alrobot2014> they didn't have the kanji iirc
[2:26:29] <alphalejandro> Translation issues
[2:26:29] <%jessiwitt> Just numerical, weren't they?
[2:26:31] <anachronologist> They were just numbers
[2:26:32] <+pectusumbra> He was billed more as a knight in the SNES version
[2:26:32] <+rasend0ri> >>-_-<<
[2:26:33] <SaltyAzteca> I think they were numbers
[2:26:36] <agadejobi> No, they had different names
[2:26:37] <anachronologist> 123456789
[2:26:40] <majindusto> THEY CHANGED IT enigmaWow
[2:26:42] <agadejobi> The number is the level you want to charge it to
[2:26:43] <linSP> 123456789
[2:26:43] <Teradyne87> No more wait time in this version
[2:26:48] <+ghostfaceninja_> kids in the 90s didn't know what "bushido" and "samurai" were Kappa
[2:26:48] <%kyh9> Dispatch, Retort, Slash
[2:26:51] <%kyh9> Boring names
[2:26:51] <KobeTeeth90> 4 is best

[2:27:08] <majindusto> Yeah...it was 1 - 9
[2:27:09] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Spell names
[2:27:10] <%agoaj> 8 with genji glove give you 16 attacks right?
[2:27:12] <+Mr_Misanthropy> yeah the swd art thing would be a number bar filling up.. but when he executed it it would display a name
[2:27:13] <yukichocomilk> i've heard this theme so much in stormblood
[2:27:16] <+Jessie_Lockhart> They were all Fire 1-3 etc
[2:27:17] <majindusto> *8
[2:27:24] <%ozzrabbit> …one of these days, we’ve got to Strong-Arm Woolie and Reggie into playing XIV. I want to see him loose his mind at the references.
[2:27:24] <Doodle_Taco> The original translation had a lot of different things
[2:27:25] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> They completely changed how Cyan works, cause Cyan in SNES 6 was bad
[2:27:27] <anachronologist> same mechanic, just named differently. Nice QOL change
[2:27:30] <alrobot2014> lot of stuff is in line with GBA names
[2:27:35] <agadejobi> Just use Fang on him
[2:27:36] <%Juriasu> things were named other stuff originally for translation reasons but also charcter limits
[2:27:38] <+pectusumbra> Spell names, at least one cutscene was censored from the SNES, other stuff was uncensored, and so on
[2:27:39] <+dougtert> pretty sure it was called bushido in the GBA version
[2:27:42] <%ChillaxingJay> LETS GO CYAN
[2:27:42] <Carlioo> this backdrop is so good
[2:27:45] <Blank9> yeah snes doma was wait 9 turns to do a single move
[2:27:46] <KobeTeeth90> OMG JUST PICK
[2:27:46] <perfect_disaster> no accent?
[2:27:48] <anachronologist> oh no
[2:27:51] <+Catpurnicus> oh man this fixes everything about cyan
[2:27:53] <anachronologist> HUH
[2:27:53] <%ChillaxingJay> EZ
[2:27:54] <+Catpurnicus> not having to wait
[2:27:55] <%kyh9> Oh, they changed how Bushido works?
[2:27:56] <anachronologist> That
[2:27:56] <BlackermanZX> BODIED
[2:27:56] <agadejobi> Holy shit, they changed how SwdTech works?
[2:27:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> DEAD
[2:27:57] <anachronologist> New
[2:27:57] <+BDazl> REKT
[2:27:59] <Doodle_Taco> Oh they changed it
[2:27:59] <OblivionSword1> damn he's strong
[2:27:59] <Teradyne87> Now the wait time is back loaded after you choose your tech
[2:28:00] <perfect_disaster> cut in half

[2:28:05] <AntiGulp> LUL
[2:28:06] <anachronologist> THE MADMEN
[2:28:06] <Teradyne87> A very nice change
[2:28:07] <+Catpurnicus> CYAN GOT FIXED?
[2:28:07] <agadejobi> You don't have to wait!? Fuck, I want to replay this version!
[2:28:09] <+IvesNapalm> Damn, Cyan's attacks not being on a timer is a huge buff
[2:28:09] <Doodle_Taco> "OH SHIT"
[2:28:11] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Cyan just leveled up in this!
[2:28:11] <%Charronia> Coward squad LUL
[2:28:11] <+pectusumbra> Bushido now only requires Cyan to wait, yes
[2:28:12] <KobeTeeth90> back in my day we had to waIT FOR BARS TO FILL UP
[2:28:12] <$SilverRoddo> Yeah, i wish Cyan had fun Auron inputs.
[2:28:17] <%kyh9> That's sort of boring but whatever
[2:28:17] <Laironx3> Woolie gonna like the Sky skill
[2:28:18] <majindusto> COWARD  OUT enigmaKEK
[2:28:21] <lotharrio> Cyan has been upgraded from D tier to C+
[2:28:22] <Garnetguy98> WOW THEY REALLY CHANGED HIM

[2:28:27] <crimsonharvest> shadow has that casper icon still nice
[2:28:29] <+Jiggisnipe> Cyan is much better without the waiting
[2:28:31] <anachronologist> Hes a whole different character now, damn
[2:28:33] <+pectusumbra> but Cyan's been changed for a while
[2:28:33] <TrigunSTAR26> Cyan is great. Btw his name is meant to be pronounced “cayenne “ like the pepper, which sounds dumb unless you spell it like “Kaien” or something like that
[2:28:34] <Blank9> cyan used to be just select bushido and wait until a move comes out
[2:28:36] <pumspreadart> WOOOOOOOOO
[2:28:37] <Teradyne87> @IvesNapalm The time is now after you make the tech choice
[2:28:40] <%AlteisenReiseZ> There's also the Psycho Cyan glitch
[2:28:44] <$SilverRoddo> Run, ya Jobbers
[2:28:44] <%kyh9> I sense main character energy

[2:36:56] <TrigunSTAR26> It’s not midi it’s 16 bit
[2:37:09] <agadejobi> It was worth it!
[2:37:13] <+pectusumbra> Oh that stings EXTRA
[2:37:16] <Teradyne87> It should say "loading" for those few seconds. It's not a bug
[2:37:16] <TrigunSTAR26> SNES didn’t use midi files
[2:37:25] <$MonsterEnvy> It's just loading
[2:37:26] <Thelaughingrouge> point is that laugh is still the GOAT
[2:37:27] <alrobot2014> yeah on my end it usually says loading
[2:37:29] <+ghostfaceninja_> whatever yall know what we mean
[2:37:35] <agadejobi> Kefka's about to use poison, why wouldn't you want the Star Pendant?
[2:37:41] <+BDazl> I might have to wait for the anime, I keep zoning out and missing stuff
[2:37:45] <rabbitlegs> it was sampled music which is more or less the same way midi works, but technically wasn't the same technology no

[2:39:40] <kinkade_77> This looks so good
[2:39:40] <+BDazl> Most villains: Let me show you my TRUE power. Kefka "Owie! finna YEET"
[2:39:43] <agadejobi> Did they already do Locke's scenario?
[2:39:54] <+pectusumbra> yes, this is the last of the 3 chapters
[2:40:00] <perfect_disaster> end the game here
[2:40:03] <+Catpurnicus> yeah he's such a shit
[2:40:04] <alrobot2014> yeah sabin's is last today
[2:40:06] <StillJustARatInACage> kefka's new sprite is great
[2:40:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Does the Liquid Ocelot point
[2:40:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Kefka is a fop and we love him for it
[2:40:10] <%ChillaxingJay> LUL
[2:40:11] <alrobot2014> locke and terra already done
[2:40:13] <%kyh9> Just the Joker
[2:40:15] <AntiGulp> Final Fantasy 6 is basically loony tunes half the time and I wouldn't have it any other way
[2:40:16] <%kyh9> Literally just the Joker
[2:40:18] <majindusto> Kefka is truly one of a kind
[2:40:19] <+ghostfaceninja_> Sephiroth he is NOT
[2:40:20] <lotharrio> Running like Phoenix runs from Gotham PD
[2:40:23] <%ChillaxingJay> WhySoSerious kefka
[2:40:31] <+pectusumbra> Joker but actually has a backstory
[2:40:53] <agadejobi> Not that it matters now, but back in the day when making this game, they worked really hard to make the sprites more expressive
[2:41:13] <agadejobi> Kefka actually uses a lot of the player sprites so he can make expressions like that
[2:41:15] <$MonsterEnvy> You have a new hat
[2:41:15] <anachronologist> its showed
[2:41:20] <lotharrio> Plumed Hat is an upgrade on Sabin, too.
[2:41:30] <%ChillaxingJay> agadejobi they did a good job
[2:41:36] <+ghostfaceninja_> who needs armor when you can't be hit
[2:41:46] <anachronologist> FFVI is very expressive with it's sprites
[2:42:07] <majindusto> TEMPLAR
[2:42:09] <+pectusumbra> very good damage
[2:42:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> YES
[2:42:13] <anachronologist> It would be
[2:42:13] <perfect_disaster> it is
[2:42:17] <+pectusumbra> but that's for later
[2:42:23] <lotharrio> Depends on the attack power of the greatsword.
[2:42:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> that's when you have stupid amounts of gil to blow
[2:42:33] <agadejobi> You can, but you should be good with the items you can buy for Shadow to throw
[2:42:34] <anachronologist> Stock up on cheap swords for throwing
[2:42:43] <anachronologist> YES
[2:42:46] <agadejobi> Not just yet, it's not worth the buy at this point
[2:42:47] <majindusto> YES
[2:42:47] <AbnormalVoid> jmikeFishpls

[2:43:22] <pumspreadart> theme of WAR CRIMES
[2:43:23] <+Jiggisnipe> burned a castle, poisoned another one
[2:43:24] <perfect_disaster> but effective
[2:43:26] <Teradyne87> Happy clown music murder time
[2:43:27] <+pectusumbra> Kefka is literally an Insane War Criminal Clown Magician
[2:43:29] <+ghostfaceninja_> Kefka's theme is so dissonant with his actions
[2:43:35] <rabbitlegs> i feel like drinking poisoned water wouldn't cause hundreds of voices screaming in unison. more like a bunch of people slowly succubing
[2:43:37] <pumspreadart> The slow walk away
[2:43:41] <perfect_disaster> ded
[2:43:43] <agadejobi> They didn't even have to drink it
[2:43:44] <+BDazl> sad
[2:43:44] <rabbitlegs> he made the poison super purple
[2:43:45] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Kefka with the PURPLE DRINK
[2:43:47] <%ChillaxingJay> :(
[2:43:51] <rabbitlegs> you didn't have to dye it
[2:43:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> "This time I poisoned the water in ALL OF GOTHAM BATTY BOI"
[2:43:53] <AbnormalVoid> what a coincidence that Cyan was the only person to not drink water that day
[2:43:53] <%ChillaxingJay> D:
[2:43:53] <Carlioo> this is some shakespeare shit
[2:43:54] <+projectmanatees> he put lean in the water
[2:43:55] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> i like how kefka's theme gets darker and more bombastic as the game goes on
[2:43:57] <%agoaj> Cyan drinks his own urine, making him immune.
[2:43:59] <Warbot40> wait did they all immediatly drink it?
[2:44:02] <majindusto> It gets  worse
[2:44:03] <%townzzzzz> dropping like flies
[2:44:03] <lotharrio> Probably fumes killing everyone instead of drinking the water.

[2:50:03] <Scorchfield> to be fair, the scene needs to account for the possibility that Shadow left early or you skipped him
[2:50:03] <agadejobi> Notice how Shadow isn't apart of this comedy routine
[2:50:08] <+Jiggisnipe> @pectusumbra naw

[2:50:56] <rabbitlegs> god the magitek armor is such a cool concept
[2:50:56] <agadejobi> Shadow doesn't have anything to say about the funny scene

[2:52:52] <stevenellis386> ninja is doing a great job being invisible
[2:52:53] <DerpioParty> It's too bad that this perpetual invisibility means no Interceptor.  Or at least I think that's the case
[2:52:54] <%HeroToxiko> Only a true ninja avoids even the sightline of their comrades

[2:53:12] <crimsonharvest> you think the empire has these guys skirmish in armor for training? somehow it seems like no
[2:53:22] <rabbitlegs> these are more like walker gears

[2:54:33] <truegreed> Shadow as thick headed as Goblin Slayer
[2:54:38] <RetroCop87> so how do the remastered graphics work with a scanline filter? Better or worse than the original?
[2:54:39] <anachronologist> WHO is talking to me over my shoulder while I sit, Sabin!?

[2:54:59] <rabbitlegs> did anyone tell them ahead of time
[2:55:09] <AbnormalVoid> him starting with Ashura really fits his character arc in a way
[2:55:16] <Chichen> feather in your... lap.\
[2:55:17] <TrigunSTAR26> Better off using a reshade filter
[2:55:20] <alrobot2014> i've seen better scanline filters in emulators
[2:55:24] <AntiGulp> @RetroCop87 I played with the scanline filter for a while. It's... well, they tried, and it was nice they included it, but it's not good. I def recommend reshade instead.
[2:55:25] <Chichen> feather in your ... hat
[2:55:27] <perfect_disaster> yes I couldnt belive it

[2:57:03] <Chichen> 3 monsters and some stray black cat
[2:57:04] <Teradyne87> Go south through the forest, there's nothing else to see
[2:57:08] <crimsonharvest> dont squander Shadow's goodwill in following you by dicking him around too much, a little is ok tho
[2:57:20] <rommlll> sonic BOOM
[2:57:31] <+pectusumbra> yeah, be careful, shadow does have random chance to leave after random battles
[2:57:31] <+BDazl> I like how there's these creepy looking monsters, and then there's just a normal cat
[2:57:34] <kinkade_77> moves look so good now
[2:57:38] <pumspreadart> basically makes them bleed out
[2:57:41] <pumspreadart> its nuts
[2:57:44] <anachronologist> "Sabin, why do Shurikans keep flying out of thin air and killing our enemies?"
[2:57:45] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> The problem with exploring is that Shadow is in the party, and everytime you fight you are rolling the dice to see if he leaves
[2:57:45] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:57:54] <anachronologist> Must be a new Relic or something

[2:58:47] <Who_lio42> single random
[2:58:52] <anachronologist> They'll go through this entire Arc without ever knowing Shadow is even still there
[2:58:53] <+pectusumbra> except instead of inputs, you just wait
[2:59:00] <crimsonharvest> did we find out if shuriken do split
[2:59:02] <Who_lio42> im so fuckin glad they fixed Cyan
[2:59:03] <Doodle_Taco> That cat got fucked
[2:59:11] <rabbitlegs> oh so not like in ff5 where you could choose to cast a spell between 1 or all monsters
[2:59:12] <RoboticRexkek> he's fuming
[2:59:13] <brunoberserk> so they changed the way bushido works in this version ?
[2:59:19] <rommlll> we in
[2:59:20] <+Jiggisnipe> this is the way Bushido should have always worked
[2:59:21] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @abelincoln_catpuncher it's a pretty low chance, and you can manipulate it with saves and quick saves
[2:59:23] <+capybruhArt> it's time

[3:03:17] <+Catpurnicus> nope, keep them in the back row
[3:03:27] <rommlll> mess around and find out
[3:03:29] <TrigunSTAR26> No
[3:03:30] <TheNix> black belt, I guess. But yeah
[3:03:31] <AbnormalVoid> some of Sabin and Cyan's skills are front row attacks, I think
[3:03:31] <NickHatesSnow> celes is op but locke ain't the best early
[3:03:37] <rabbitlegs> well, spellcasters do more damage from the back row, traditionally
[3:03:38] <rommlll> OOOO
[3:03:42] <rommlll> I SEE IT
[3:03:45] <+lightbringrrrr> IT'S TIME
[3:03:47] <rabbitlegs> the question i guess is whether their skills count as magic
[3:03:48] <+rasend0ri> @rasend0ri thanks
[3:03:52] <+lightbringrrrr> let's go boys
[3:03:57] <majindusto> HERE WE GOOOO
[3:03:58] <AbnormalVoid> oh wow
[3:04:00] <KobeTeeth90> EVERYBODY SHUTUP
[3:04:03] <%ChillaxingJay> hmm
[3:04:07] <%CaptainBeird> what that in the distance? looks fun!
[3:04:09] <TrigunSTAR26> Usually no reason to use “attack” anyway
[3:04:11] <mass1997> Chat relax
[3:04:13] <majindusto> enigmaHmm
[3:04:16] <+MysteryJ> I really like your slow burn on this, Wooly.
[3:04:19] <crimsonharvest> it wasnt timing, it was fucking waiting to charge
[3:04:22] <Doodle_Taco> It was pretty shit
[3:04:22] <pumspreadart> Because some extra weapon based skills wont proc if you use character skills
[3:04:23] <truegreed> It was a slow charge
[3:04:27] <AntiGulp> It was bad
[3:04:28] <Chichen> it sucked
[3:04:31] <Wisconsinite> enigmaZone
[3:04:31] <AbnormalVoid> attack is better in the future, but for now, skills rule
[3:04:31] <TheLemuroid> It costs turns
[3:04:32] <+Jiggisnipe> and most importantly, you couldn't use other peope
[3:04:32] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> It was bad
[3:04:34] <%kyh9> Yeah
[3:04:34] <alrobot2014> it was dogshit
[3:04:34] <TheNix> it was really awful. Way better in this version
[3:04:38] <%kyh9> I wish they replaced it with something new
[3:04:40] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It took forever to get through those numbers
[3:04:40] <%ChillaxingJay> it wasnt that bad
[3:04:42] <Skeletonmanners> you waited and enemies would keep attacking you
[3:04:43] <iambqb> you could get attacked while it charged
[3:04:46] <Walterion_> same order
[3:04:51] <Scorchfield> yep, it sucked, made cyan bad because you had to wait around forever
[3:04:52] <+pectusumbra> It was garbage because you couldn't give your other characters commands while waiting
[3:04:52] <Blank9> time passed while doing it, it cost everyone else's turns to do
[3:04:54] <wanderingdain90> part of the reason why I never used cyan because I hated waiting for the skills to charge
[3:04:55] <Jay_san_swed> i never used cyan due to that
[3:04:55] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah it was that order
[3:05:00] <+MysteryJ> The slow charge made it hard to use unless your other guys were all queued up
[3:05:01] <shiny_prinny> now you just select the level you want and it waits for you
[3:05:01] <truegreed> Battle was still active during the charge
[3:05:04] <lotharrio> You'd sit around to wait, and enemies could still attack you.
[3:05:04] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> The charge times were too slow, and the techs weren't good enough to warrent the charge time
[3:05:06] <+Jessie_Lockhart> No strongest attack took longer to use
[3:05:20] <%ChillaxingJay> interesting that never botgered me un the old version
[3:05:28] <%ChillaxingJay> *bothered
[3:05:28] <haisho> I'm making a guess here, but he probably still charges it up and takes time to use bigger moves
[3:05:36] <johnjohnmajima> I liked the old charge system
[3:05:37] <%ozzrabbit> …IS THAT WHY SAM HAS SEN COUNTERS IN XIV?
[3:05:44] <gulthrax> Sabin is muh boi, playa
[3:05:51] <+pectusumbra> hold up
[3:05:55] <+MysteryJ> it was kinda annoying, but still quite viable if you attacked last with him
[3:05:55] <truegreed> @ChillaxingJay I mean we accepted it as a function because he was still so good
[3:05:56] <haisho> uh oh
[3:05:56] <Chichen> 🚆
[3:05:56] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I like that you just pick it in menu and then you wait
[3:05:57] <BoneofMalkav> Here we go!

[3:20:28] <rommlll> bury me w my money
[3:20:28] <+Jessie_Lockhart> So unless thats not the case in this, if you press up when choosing a number it immediately jumps by ten
[3:20:31] <rabbitlegs> outdoors or at save points
[3:20:39] <morkelebmink> the phantom train is what cemented for me Sabin being my favorite character
[3:20:46] <+Catpurnicus> so its weird when I watch people play this game without stocking the hell up

[3:34:46] <Teradyne87> @lotharrio I understood that reference
[3:34:50] <majindusto> Always  Tip your Ghost  Waiters
[3:34:53] <yukichocomilk> never ever tip
[3:35:01] <@Solidus_113> or just have the servers get paid a real wage
[3:35:02] <Jaysky> "IOU"
[3:35:03] <+UKOrigin> you in the east, so a tip is an insult
[3:35:10] <RetroCop87> oh man, I never even considered the race factor in tipping
[3:35:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:35:18] <Jaysky> @solidus_113 Mo way that'd be too absurd
[3:35:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> Imagine paying waiters a living wage?
[3:35:25] <FrostedZaibatsu> Like woah youre black, you need this more than me
[3:35:26] <%oneimportantthing> In Scandinavia there's very little tip culture, because waiters get paid decently

[3:43:48] <+Mendin> 7th saga where you had the encounter radar
[3:44:00] <lotharrio> Lufia 2 is solid. Some will hunt you down, some are stuck in a loop, some only move when you do. Plus it's got like three systems running in combat.

[3:45:14] <pumspreadart> SABIN
[3:45:21] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Earring better on Sabin
[3:45:22] <alrobot2014> i don't think earring is doing anything for cyan
[3:45:27] <anachronologist> earring should go on Sabin
[3:45:30] <lotharrio> Sabin's Aurabolt triggers the EArring.
[3:45:31] <majindusto> GHOST #4 was a Champ :(

[3:45:42] <pumspreadart> HYPER WRIST ON SABIN
[3:45:52] <+pectusumbra> sabin with the earring will give his aura blast a boost
[3:45:53] <+rasend0ri> Reggie with the save
[3:45:56] <lotharrio> Also Sabin can wear the Buckler.
[3:46:27] <NickHatesSnow> Reggie is MVP
[3:46:41] <johnjohnmajima> what does Sabin need a shield for?
[3:46:44] <anachronologist> fyi an earring on Sabin will raise some of his blitz attacks powers cause some of them are based on magic damage
[3:47:11] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Good for someone who only attacks

[4:50:49] <BepBepAmShep> @TheGershon Imp, if I remember right.
[4:50:49] <lotharrio> Easiest way to use Gau is to just get Stray Cat and only use it. You need a guide for him otherwise.
[4:50:49] <NickHatesSnow> Blue Mage
[4:50:50] <$Rafraud> So its jump?
[4:50:50] <serigof> GAO
[4:50:51] <%Juriasu> this is where mind goblins go to die
[4:50:54] <pumspreadart> one of the most interesting mechanics
[4:50:55] <+MoxaHaunt> Blue mage it is then
[4:50:55] <%CaptainBeird> blue mage boy
[4:50:57] <+LastHazzerd> a very weird blue mage
[4:50:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Blue Mage
[4:50:57] <majindusto> BLUE MAGE YO
[4:50:58] <+Jessie_Lockhart> So yeah only the fight he disappears and reappears
[4:51:00] <%StaceMcGate> Is Stray Cat still the most broken rage?
[4:51:00] <anachronologist> potentially best character in the game with the right skills
[4:51:03] <%Stormzcales_Lair> More liek Beastmaster than Blue mage

[4:51:15] <marvel877> He's the "Get a Player's Guide" character
[4:51:16] <+samuraicaveman> he's like a blue mage berserker
[4:51:16] <truegreed> Blue Mage is literally what he's about
[4:51:17] <%AngryAsian5> Kappa Kappa
[4:51:17] <%livlinn> joofbWave
[4:51:19] <+pectusumbra> Stray Cat is really good from the start. Nightshade is also good along with others
[4:51:19] <+yeknomlive> gau is a unique one
[4:51:23] <+StarPhoenix108> copy the stray cats
[4:51:24] <alphalejandro> Gau's a blue mage
[4:51:26] <NickHatesSnow> He also gains the monsters stats and resistances
[4:51:28] <+wanzerfaust> Not really blue mage.
[4:51:30] <KobeTeeth90> yup
[4:51:30] <pumspreadart> he's a weird blue mage type character but hes totally unique
[4:51:31] <+LastHazzerd> that looks like a jojo character
[4:51:31] <Shazbeaut> He's no longer a stoner

[4:51:42] <%LouieRouie> Kid Blanka
[4:51:48] <Laironx3> Stray Cat is one of the good skills. I forgot the rest
[4:51:49] <alphalejandro> Yes
[4:51:54] <+sssoapy> kimari was a blue mage
[4:51:54] <+pectusumbra> Kimari
[4:51:56] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Hes not a blue mage
[4:51:57] <%StaceMcGate> I wonder if they fixed Stray Cat
[4:51:58] <berasite> ff10
[4:51:58] <KobeTeeth90> kimari
[4:51:59] <crimsonharvest> nah hes not like blue mage, blue magic means you have to get hit with it to learn it
[4:52:00] <+Jiggisnipe> Quisits Kimari
[4:52:00] <+anoldtoilet> gau is extremely weird
[4:52:00] <PinkSocks> FFX has kimari
[4:52:01] <Parasocial_Interaction> Kimari
[4:52:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Khimari
[4:52:02] <+JupiterDjin> Khimari was kind of a blue mage
[4:52:02] <jaysondeez> Kumari was blue mage
[4:52:02] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Kimari was a blue mage
[4:52:03] <+LastHazzerd> Kimari would be blue mage
[4:52:06] <majindusto> Khimari
[4:52:06] <+hephep_311> hes not blue mage
[4:52:07] <pumspreadart> Not really a blue mage, totally unique
[4:52:07] <+pectusumbra> He's like a weirder kimari
[4:52:07] <alrobot2014> He's also technically not a blue mae
[4:52:08] <rommlll> he's funne monk
[4:52:08] <$Rafraud> Critically Acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV
[4:52:10] <anachronologist> Koichi
[4:52:12] <coziestbank> There's actually a separate blue mage character in this
[4:52:12] <+wanzerfaust> He straight up turns into the monster, uncontrollably.
[4:52:13] <%Stormzcales_Lair> He Beastmaster, just functions similar here
[4:52:15] <+SolidusRex> Enemy Skill = Blue Magic
[4:52:16] <+Jiggisnipe> also he's not a blue mage
[4:52:16] <rabbitlegs> blue magic is imitating enemy skills
[4:52:18] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> He was a bad blue mage, but still a blue mage
[4:52:19] <goose_coward> a feral child mage
[4:52:19] <+yeknomlive> blue mage for gau isnt quite right
[4:52:20] <+pectusumbra> Fair enough
[4:52:22] <+Krivvan> Blue Mage is an archetype that uses Enemy Skills
[4:52:23] <+pectusumbra> 5
[4:52:23] <+LastHazzerd> yeah literal blue mages are not super common
[4:52:25] <+Jiggisnipe> 5?
[4:52:25] <crimsonharvest> Gau's fairly unique actually
[4:52:25] <jaysondeez> ffv was first blue mage
[4:52:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Started in 5
[4:52:28] <+SolidusRex> 5
[4:52:30] <+anoldtoilet> gau is like invoking monster spirits and turning into an ai controlled spammer
[4:52:30] <lotharrio> He's closer to FF5's animal trainer.
[4:52:33] <dds333a> He means the job, as opposed to an approximation LUL
[4:52:34] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Blue mage has to see an attack to learn it in this
[4:52:36] <rabbitlegs> first one was 5
[4:52:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[4:52:38] <%sriracha_pon> Yeah FF10 and Kimhari
[4:52:38] <majindusto> 5
[4:52:40] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Quistis was also a blue mage...kinda
[4:52:41] <+anoldtoilet> he can be very bad but also he can be extremely strong
[4:52:42] <NickHatesSnow> He's more intense than a blue mage
[4:52:43] <anachronologist> Gau = E Skill Materia made manifest
[4:52:48] <toulon_somberjade> Except you can't control him when. He's raging biut he's broken with the right rages
[4:52:48] <rommlll> always go magitex
[4:52:53] <+DGenerator> there are a bunch of blue mage-likes in Final Fantasy
[4:52:54] <maddest_of_villains> ah yes, my favorite animal
[4:52:54] <rabbitlegs> blue magic is like the major source of humor in that game
[4:52:55] <crimsonharvest> and no its not going to tell you what they do
[4:52:56] <haisho> yo he got Magitek Armor
[4:52:57] <truegreed> Using Enemy Skills and not being called a Blue Mage? That's outrageous
[4:52:58] <maddest_of_villains> magitek armor
[4:53:06] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Only the Veldt
[4:53:09] <+anoldtoilet> fighting enemies in the rest of the game unlocks them here
[4:53:10] <+Falkdaddu> Gau is a cross between an animal tamer and berserker
[4:53:11] <alrobot2014> you get what you fought when he leaves and when he comes back
[4:53:12] <wanderingdain90> go get stray cat
[4:53:13] <Drusain> Only here
[4:53:13] <KobeTeeth90> its a bifg green patch
[4:53:16] <+pectusumbra> And you can fight ANY enemy in the game on the Veldt
[4:53:19] <morkelebmink> veldt has every monster
[4:53:19] <DoctorMulholland> If you hear the cool music, Gau is game
[4:53:20] <%Stormzcales_Lair> You fight enemies to bring them to veldt
[4:53:20] <majindusto> ONLY VELDT
[4:53:22] <alphalejandro> Only the Veldt
[4:53:22] <anachronologist> The Veldt builds up enemies as you progress throughout the game as well
[4:53:23] <0ddeye> Veldt contains all the monsters you have fought so far
[4:53:25] <+Krivvan> The veldt has massive enemy variety
[4:53:26] <jaysondeez> but the veldt has every enemy you've ever encountered
[4:53:27] <rommlll> gau learned LAVOS
[4:53:27] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> The only one that matters right now is Stray Cat
[4:53:31] <%Sunriser41> oh he can learn every enemy in the game here
[4:53:33] <lotharrio> There's 260 something skills.
[4:53:34] <NickHatesSnow> The Veldt gets new enemies as the game goes on
[4:53:34] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus  every enemy you defeat will appear in the veldt as a possible encounter
[4:53:36] <alrobot2014> Every enemy comes to the veldt
[4:53:37] <%Glock3bb> All enemies you encounter will appear on the Veldt.
[4:53:38] <lotharrio> Just get Stray Cat
[4:53:39] <Drusain> Stray Cat
[4:53:41] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Stray Cat
[4:53:44] <+anoldtoilet> stray cat isnt even the most busted
[4:53:46] <+pectusumbra> For right now you just want Stray Cat
[4:53:47] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Axe Knight is really good and Stray Cat
[4:53:47] <jaysondeez> straycat is the one to get do sure
[4:53:49] <toulon_somberjade> Also the Veldt will have almost all of the enemies you've encountered
[4:53:50] <a_mad_dragon_> Stray Cat is all you'll ever need
[4:53:51] <+anoldtoilet> and rng for it is pretty hard to get to show up
[4:53:55] <+StarPhoenix108> STRAY CAT
[4:53:57] <+yeknomlive> stray cat is great
[4:54:00] <+anoldtoilet> theres a great healer one that i forget
[4:54:02] <+Falkdaddu> They patched stray cat didn’t they?
[4:54:04] <AntiGulp> I think there's 255 different skills?
[4:54:05] <dds333a> Axe Knight is the bee's knees
[4:54:05] <+anoldtoilet> and one that just like spams meteor
[4:54:05] <+DaveStrider55> the thing about gau is you select which monster to be, and you lose control of him the rest of the battle while he mimics it basically
[4:54:06] <Parasocial_Interaction> Stray Cat is the way.
[4:54:07] <+pectusumbra> Also he doesn't use weapons
[4:54:09] <%townzzzzz> claw weapons for him
[4:54:10] <rommlll> all he needs is them hands
[4:54:12] <SaltyAzteca> You people have clearly forgotten the Behemoth
[4:54:12] <+rbakervv> buy him a shield
[4:54:13] <pumspreadart> imperial solider
[4:54:18] <anachronologist> @toulon_somberjade SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[4:54:19] <+pectusumbra> Depends on the enemy he uses
[4:54:21] <rabbitlegs> ff5 is probably enough of a thesis on how busted blue magic can get
[4:54:21] <crimsonharvest> if its a caster type it can
[4:54:24] <lotharrio> @AntiGulp There's more that 255, but you can only use 255.
[4:54:30] <Teradyne87> Yes magic, no mp cost
[4:54:31] <NickHatesSnow> He's bare handed
[4:54:36] <dds333a> Test em Kappa
[4:54:39] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Gotta experiment
[4:54:46] <Walterion_> Experimenting is the way with Gau
[4:54:46] <AntiGulp> @lotharrio Oh nice! Thanks! I'm doing my own first playthrough atm
[4:54:47] <rabbitlegs> so it's no wonder they decided to rein it in a bit
[4:54:50] <Drusain> Time to lag 200 rage skills
[4:54:53] <Drusain> lab
[4:54:53] <AbnormalVoid> Gau's a Beastmaster not a Blue Mage, that's later
[4:54:55] <+pectusumbra> But yeah, gotta play around or just use a wiki to find the good ones
[4:55:00] <%Juriasu> oh shit
[4:55:01] <dds333a> LUL
[4:55:02] <truegreed> Beastmaster is not what Gau is
[4:55:05] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:55:05] <rommlll> dw about it
[4:55:08] <%Glock3bb> Sniper eye+stray cat = op
[4:55:08] <alrobot2014> EVERY enemy comes here
[4:55:09] <KobeTeeth90> this area has almost all the enemies
[4:55:10] <lotharrio> Fighting to control the Veldt... I guess?
[4:55:11] <+anoldtoilet> the veldt is a mystic weird place
[4:55:11] <morkelebmink> veldt has every monster
[4:55:13] <AbnormalVoid> It has to mate and make more Magitek Armor babies
[4:55:18] <dds333a> For the sake of the mechanic Kappa
[4:55:18] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Bosses are the exception
[4:55:21] <anachronologist> Monster buffet
[4:55:24] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[4:55:29] <Drusain> Everything you've ever fought
[4:55:30] <lotharrio> It's everything you've ever fought... mostly.
[4:55:31] <+pectusumbra> Everything you've seen, including bosses
[4:55:32] <%Deosier> as long you fight it once you'll find it here
[4:55:33] <Walterion_> and it increases the further you get into the game
[4:55:33] <anachronologist> it increases as you encounter
[4:55:34] <+DaveStrider55> its that time of the year for the annual Magitek Armor migration
[4:55:34] <SaltyAzteca> Any beast that you have fought
[4:55:35] <alrobot2014> if you encounter them they will be here
[4:55:35] <OldManDeckardCain> magitech armor in its natural habitat, truly fascinating Kappa
[4:55:36] <+anoldtoilet> @WoolieVersus but you have to see the enemy in the normal game first.
[4:55:38] <+DGenerator> it cycles through the enemy list in a stagnated, but circular fashion
[4:55:42] <anachronologist> Go Reggie
[4:55:42] <AbnormalVoid> Magitek Armor, grazing on the plains
[4:55:43] <TrigunSTAR26> Enemies in the Veldt also don’t give exp so you can grind later without overleveling for a certain mechanic they introduce later
[4:55:43] <+DGenerator> or, encounter ilst
[4:55:44] <Walterion_> and Gau can learn it.
[4:55:45] <+Jessie_Lockhart> But you can even get enemies that were monster-in-a-box
[4:55:50] <SaltyAzteca> That includes some bosses
[4:55:57] <dds333a> Only what's already felled
[4:56:09] <pumspreadart> careful
[4:56:10] <%Juriasu> oh no no no
[4:56:15] <toulon_somberjade> Basically also useful for Stealing and other things as well like Blue Magic
[4:56:15] <lotharrio> More than 255
[4:56:16] <SaltyAzteca> Balanced? ohohohohohohhoho
[4:56:20] <alrobot2014> busted is the name of the game in FF6
[4:56:23] <AbnormalVoid> it's possible but it fucking sucks
[4:56:26] <+pectusumbra> It's possible but it's NOT WORTH IT
[4:56:26] <Drusain> It's possible but why would you
[4:56:27] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Problem is there’s a lot of overlap
[4:56:30] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Gau is busted if you know what you're doing
[4:56:33] <+pectusumbra> yes
[4:56:34] <+anoldtoilet> and i think some are indeed permanently missable
[4:56:35] <jaysondeez> yes luck
[4:56:37] <+pectusumbra> just wait
[4:56:38] <rommlll> Uwaoo~!
[4:56:41] <SaltyAzteca> just wait
[4:56:44] <AbnormalVoid> did they add any QoL for the Veldt?
[4:56:45] <+hephep_311> gua is either terrible or great. depends what you know
[4:56:48] <%townzzzzz> MEAT NOW
[4:56:50] <+DaveStrider55> yall got super lucky, lesser lopros is a really good rage for him this early lol
[4:56:52] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:56:55] <anachronologist> Hes imprinting! how adorabnle
[4:57:00] <lotharrio> Yeah, Lopros is a good get.
[4:57:05] <jaysondeez> frieeeeend
[4:57:08] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Theres no reason not to though
[4:57:10] <Drusain> The one he learns is the one you Leaped on
[4:57:11] <%Glock3bb> Yes.
[4:57:12] <arkv01> yo child welfare open up
[4:57:12] <AbnormalVoid> you can't attack him, iirc, he interrupts you
[4:57:12] <dds333a> LUL
[4:57:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Its the enemy you lesrn
[4:57:15] <+pectusumbra> Gau is WEIRD
[4:57:17] <TheNix> Might as well just let him join and then leap again when you want to
[4:57:18] <+DGenerator> it's a rotating encounter list
[4:57:22] <%Stormzcales_Lair> was oo much for my child brain
[4:57:24] <TrigunSTAR26> I think enemies are divided across the Veldt by sections to make it more likely to encounter the one you’re looking for
[4:57:26] <Drusain> He learns the one you used Leap on
[4:57:26] <toulon_somberjade> It fucking is
[4:57:28] <pumspreadart> love this boi
[4:57:28] <RasenRendan> Glad the font in this remake isnt offensive like when the first 3 games released
[4:57:28] <SaltyAzteca> You already had Magitek Armor btw
[4:57:30] <Treasure_Vault> It's both? I think it said both
[4:57:30] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[4:57:33] <pumspreadart> he is special
[4:57:34] <+DaveStrider55> you learn the enemies he leapt into, and the enemies that are present when he comes back
[4:57:35] <AbnormalVoid> too late now lol
[4:57:39] <+yeknomlive> you'll see when you battle with gau
[4:57:40] <Teradyne87> Also note you don't earn xp on the Veldt
[4:57:41] <jaysondeez> check abilities now
[4:57:44] <arkv01> @RasenRendan it was, they modded it
[4:57:46] <Walterion_> He should have a new rage then
[4:57:47] <+yeknomlive> itll make sense
[4:57:50] <alrobot2014> its a lot to take in
[4:57:56] <RasenRendan> @arkv01 oh my god square...
[4:58:00] <%CaptainBeird> gau is really weird
[4:58:03] <rommlll> I never liked Gau, too complicated
[4:58:05] <alrobot2014> which is why i just ignor him in most playthroughs
[4:58:13] <dds333a> I'll tell you, this all flew over my head as a kid, and not until I played at 21 did i learn all this
[4:58:20] <%Juriasu> it probably better to just let him back and just focus on getting him to leap from the fight you want to learn stuff from
[4:58:22] <+pectusumbra> I mean you can just have him leap again
[4:58:24] <lotharrio> It's better to just get him back, to leap again.
[4:58:30] <crimsonharvest> the Brave New World mod for FF6 does a good job of overhauling his movelist and also providing documentation
[4:58:30] <anachronologist> hes really not that complicated when you start to get the hang of it
[4:58:31] <Treasure_Vault> IT said you learn both leap in and return abilities
[4:58:33] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Its not skills specifically, its the enemy
[4:58:34] <rommlll> always go magitek yeah
[4:58:36] <+pectusumbra> Note, it's the ENEMY Armor
[4:58:37] <arkv01> gau is uhh time consuming so it may be a tough time to learn skills
[4:58:39] <toulon_somberjade> A lot of machincs on this game don't ever get used again because of how impractical or hard to balance they are....or in one case how they cause game breaking glitches
[4:58:43] <jaysondeez> he rages
[4:58:44] <MogMoogle1> You keep learning till you get him back
[4:58:47] <dds333a> Think Vincent, to use a later example
[4:58:47] <%Shad0wTag> HE IS TOO WILD
[4:58:48] <+hephep_311> its like a rage style
[4:58:48] <lotharrio> Magitek Armor ENEMY.
[4:58:49] <%townzzzzz> CAN'T CONTROL THE RAGE
[4:58:49] <RetroCop87> Woolie over-explains it all
[4:58:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> So he just learned lesser loprots
[4:58:54] <jaysondeez> you basically turn him into an enemy
[4:58:55] <+anoldtoilet> yeah gau is like a barbarian going into spirit rages
[4:58:56] <arkv01> berserker blue mage
[4:58:57] <rabbitlegs> okay im starting to understand this
[4:58:58] <pumspreadart> raaggeeee of africaaaaaaa
[4:59:00] <Walterion_> he emulates the properties of the enemy as well.
[4:59:00] <%Shad0wTag> VIOLENCE MARK TWO
[4:59:05] <+anoldtoilet> hes like a shaman invoker thing
[4:59:06] <alphalejandro> Rage is kinda Berserker
[4:59:06] <anachronologist> He CAN BE with the right moves
[4:59:07] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus attacking him is useful if you don't like what he comes back on...but you could always just get him back and decide when to leap again.
[4:59:09] <dds333a> @pumspreadart RAGE
[4:59:10] <alrobot2014> oh he isn't the most busted thing though this game goes nuts
[4:59:12] <toulon_somberjade> And naturally how all of them pale once you see what's coming up
[4:59:17] <rabbitlegs> i guess it does work closer to beastmaster then
[4:59:19] <%CaptainBeird> how he manages to summon the spirit of magitek armor idk
[4:59:22] <NickHatesSnow> If you could control him this game would break open
[4:59:23] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[4:59:28] <+anoldtoilet> hes an imaginative kid...
[4:59:29] <Jay_san_swed> some are so good, some are horrible. it is like a roulette
[4:59:30] <linSP> He’s an enemy, not a blue mage
[4:59:30] <+LastHazzerd> so is it better to make him only learn like... 1 really good move?
[4:59:35] <aka_Jigawatt> SourPls
[4:59:45] <+anoldtoilet> you can pick which rage he goes into and they have a limited moveset
[4:59:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:59:46] <anachronologist> Is Shadow still in that Megitech armor?
[4:59:47] <dds333a> LUL
[4:59:48] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:59:49] <Drusain> pew
[4:59:50] <%townzzzzz> BOY JUST SHOT A LASER
[4:59:50] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus he also doesn't ever come back on a back attack or pincer.
[4:59:54] <%xerotwo> HOW LUL
[4:59:57] <pumspreadart> pchooooo
[4:59:58] <alrobot2014> he also takes enemy status effects if they have natural ones
[4:59:59] <alphalejandro> Monkey boy can do laser
[5:00:00] <jaysondeez> WOLF CHILD SPITTING LASERA
[5:00:00] <+Krivvan> @LastHazzerd you can pick which enemy he emulates
[5:00:03] <TheNix> @alrobot2014 I dunno if it works in this version but he used to be able to charm the final boss. Certainly up there
[5:00:03] <goose_coward> normal wild child
[5:00:04] <Walterion_> not the weirdest thing Cyan has been today.
[5:00:07] <pumspreadart> he's essentially berserk
[5:00:10] <lotharrio> If he gets ko'd you can revive and do a new Rage
[5:00:11] <NickHatesSnow> He also gains the resistance and weaknesses too
[5:00:13] <rommlll> "Im bullshit, uwaoo~!"
[5:00:14] <TenguGemini> if he gets KOd I think you can choose again
[5:00:15] <+LastHazzerd> @LastHazzerd OH okay so that's good then
[5:00:16] <+HereComestheChief> LISTEN IT’S FINE
[5:00:20] <Jay_san_swed> berserked beastmaster
[5:00:25] <+pectusumbra> Also if he rages into an undead he gets undead status, if an enemy absorbs fire he'll absorb fire
[5:00:37] <+anoldtoilet> he can do very cool moves with certain enemies yeah. lmfao oh yeah thats true too pectus
[5:00:38] <jaysondeez> if you want
[5:00:40] <alrobot2014> forever
[5:00:43] <dds333a> If you'd like Kappa
[5:00:45] <+anoldtoilet> he effectively turns into the monster in terms of stats yeah
[5:00:46] <anachronologist> So, I like to think Gau just watches his prey to learn their movies by imitating them until he can eventually shoot Fucking LASER BEAMS OUT OF THIN AIR
[5:00:49] <Treasure_Vault> Sit here and grind while doing that sidequest with the mail? Seems intended
[5:00:50] <jaysondeez> no exp but you get gil
[5:00:51] <+pectusumbra> The only one we'd recommend at the moment is Stray Cat. and No BOSSES ARE HERE
[5:00:52] <goose_coward> Gau in smash when?
[5:00:54] <+Jessie_Lockhart> For as long as there are monsters left to learn
[5:00:59] <+Jiggisnipe> he's probably the most unique FF character mechanically
[5:01:00] <KobeTeeth90> No bosses
[5:01:01] <A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Oh, hey guys!
[5:01:02] <lotharrio> It's easiest to just get Stray Cat.
[5:01:04] <+anoldtoilet> so certain enemies with immunities? if he turns into them hes just fully immune to the same stuff
[5:01:06] <Walterion_> some bosses show up here, yes.
[5:01:10] <Jay_san_swed> midbosses
[5:01:10] <%townzzzzz> bosses that become normal enemy
[5:01:10] <dds333a> Certain ones
[5:01:11] <lotharrio> At least two bosses show up here.
[5:01:14] <OBS_VinnieK> in the SNES version know bosses would show up
[5:01:14] <arkv01> yeah its kinda sick
[5:01:15] <+pectusumbra> You can steal from them yes
[5:01:17] <Drusain> Stray Cat just carries you yeah
[5:01:19] <arkv01> you can steal I think
[5:01:20] <+Jiggisnipe> no
[5:01:20] <crimsonharvest> no, no xp here
[5:01:21] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus I would MAKE sure to get Stray Cat, no matter what.
[5:01:21] <TheNix> no exp but otherwise
[5:01:22] <alrobot2014> hey spy!
[5:01:22] <+DGenerator> no experience on the veldt
[5:01:23] <%Stormzcales_Lair> no xp
[5:01:24] <+Jessie_Lockhart> No experience
[5:01:25] <pumspreadart> No experience on the veldt
[5:01:26] <+Jiggisnipe> no xp here
[5:01:26] <Treasure_Vault> No exp on the veldt
[5:01:26] <+pectusumbra> Bosses don't drop XP for this express reason
[5:01:27] <truegreed> Veldt has no XP
[5:01:27] <A_German_spy> @alrobot2014 charly23Hi
[5:01:29] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You don't get exp here
[5:01:30] <anachronologist> FFVI Bitches!
[5:01:33] <jaysondeez> no xp on the vedlt, only gil
[5:01:36] <dds333a> LUL
[5:01:38] <pumspreadart> gil tho
[5:01:39] <+Jessie_Lockhart> You dont even get GP iirc, only items
[5:01:43] <arkv01> I've never fucked around with the veldt in my two runs LUL
[5:01:47] <dds333a> Well, gotta find them, no? Kappa
[5:01:50] <%CaptainBeird> i would love if gau just could become ghost train
[5:01:53] <lotharrio> RIP Stray Cat.
[5:02:10] <TenguGemini> gau can be really OP
[5:02:17] <Treasure_Vault> What's the deal with stray cat?
[5:02:18] <+anoldtoilet> its very weird and hard to figure out but yeah gau can be really sick
[5:02:18] <johnjohnmajima> stray cat
[5:02:22] <Shazbeaut> Stray cat is better
[5:02:23] <TenguGemini> most characters have some way to make them super busted
[5:02:23] <+hephep_311> try them out and youll find what you like
[5:02:25] <%Glock3bb> Stray cat!
[5:02:25] <pumspreadart> wait no its not your magitek armor
[5:02:28] <wanderingdain90> stray cat will carry you through 75% of the game
[5:02:29] <Parasocial_Interaction> Stray cat
[5:02:29] <Jay_san_swed> stray ftw
[5:02:31] <+anoldtoilet> stray cat does a really strong physical attack either four times or eight times
[5:02:31] <+pectusumbra> Remember, it's the ENEMY move list, not yours. So Magi armor is lazer and kick
[5:02:32] <+LastHazzerd> ENEMY magitek, not the magitek you control
[5:02:32] <crimsonharvest> but its emulating an enemy, not the playable one
[5:02:34] <squidpeanut> Stray cat is really strong
[5:02:34] <+Jessie_Lockhart> You dont get all those
[5:02:39] <+anoldtoilet> its not incredible but its a very good attack
[5:02:44] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus Stray Cat's Catscratch
[5:02:45] <+Jiggisnipe> well that's your magitek armor, enemy armor is different
[5:02:47] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Only two attacks, 1 basic and 1 special
[5:02:48] <+anoldtoilet> like, people oversell it imo. its really strong though
[5:02:48] <%townzzzzz> banish
[5:02:53] <dds333a> Carry on LUL
[5:02:58] <pumspreadart> you get the enemy moveset, not the playable moveset
[5:03:02] <alrobot2014> its the moveset of the enemy named Magitek Armor not the ones you controlled
[5:03:08] <A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus He gets one move per enemy, but each Rage gives him a different weapon, and most of them give him some status buff or another.
[5:03:10] <+anoldtoilet> but gau basically just does 8x cuts every round and they can eventually each do max damage
[5:03:14] <rommlll> anime moment
[5:03:16] <Drusain> It's 4x normal damage it's not overhyped
[5:03:19] <%townzzzzz> head smack
[5:03:22] <+anoldtoilet> so gau in stray cat mode hops forward and does 8x9999
[5:03:36] <+anoldtoilet> oh times 4
[5:03:40] <dds333a> Iconic Catscratch
[5:04:02] <A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Normal attack with 4x damage. It's a single hit.
[5:04:02] <anachronologist> Cat Scratch FEVER
[5:04:07] <Teradyne87> He did it
[5:04:09] <+pectusumbra> he becomes the enemy
[5:04:17] <+pectusumbra> stray cat
[5:04:22] <wanderingdain90> you should get that before you leave
[5:04:26] <+pectusumbra> and yeah, as soon as you leap he's gone
[5:04:27] <dds333a> There are variables here Kappa
[5:04:31] <anachronologist> LETS
[5:04:32] <lotharrio> Your lesser lopros is a good get, too.
[5:04:34] <Jay_san_swed> you can only get in the veldt
[5:04:34] <anachronologist> CHOP CATS
[5:04:36] <+hephep_311> did they finish doing their mail quest?
[5:04:44] <alrobot2014> nah they ran out of money
[5:04:48] <+DGenerator> RIP 500 gil
[5:04:49] <+LastHazzerd> PATCHES!
[5:04:56] <pumspreadart> no more gil for Sabin
[5:04:57] <+anoldtoilet> i dont remember which enemy it is but gau can be the best healer iirc
[5:05:01] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:05:02] <dds333a> LUL
[5:05:06] <dds333a> NotLikeThis
[5:05:06] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Oh Gau you little prankster

[5:05:30] <jaysondeez> get it now
[5:05:31] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus too late now
[5:05:39] <lotharrio> If you wait, it will just mean more random enemies on the Veldt to cycle through.
[5:05:40] <anachronologist> GET THAT Kitty
[5:05:41] <dds333a> That fucking kid from Beyond Thunderdome
[5:05:41] <squidpeanut> Gau is in opera omnia
[5:05:44] <+Krivvan> does that line still only show up when you have less than 500 gil?
[5:05:57] <StillJustARatInACage> all three of you fit your heads into a single diving helmet
[5:06:00] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> how do they all fit in there?
[5:06:00] <+pupil31> whomst
[5:06:00] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Gau is legit my favorite character in Dissidia Opera Omnia. He's so much fun
[5:06:02] <+pectusumbra> Cyan ends his speech with Degozaru
[5:06:02] <crimsonharvest> yeah common popular usage is fuckin worthless nobody can do it
[5:06:06] <+Krivvan> ff14 manages to use that older english properly
[5:06:10] <dds333a> Did your church forbid anything but KJV LUL
[5:06:18] <+VirtuesReward> So all three heads are gonna fit in a hat one helmet? Kappa
[5:06:22] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yes one helmet for all three of you
[5:06:25] <+HavenlessWF> under da sea!
[5:06:26] <dds333a> Because mine allowed at least NIV
[5:06:34] <rabbitlegs> but it's....technology...
[5:06:35] <goose_coward> all cram our heads in there
[5:06:38] <Iwashi94> "Remember Gau, a man chooses, a slave obeys"
[5:06:39] <+pectusumbra> woah give us a choice
[5:06:39] <jaysondeez> cutscened in
[5:06:42] <%CaptainBeird> if i don't call back by thursday do what needest be done. thouest?
[5:06:43] <+anoldtoilet> i think you can go right back
[5:06:45] <+capybruhArt> they just fit into sabin's muscle creases
[5:06:53] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Well they arent called Slo-pids
[5:06:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:07:03] <+pectusumbra> damn it
[5:07:05] <+hephep_311> anyone know if these remasters kept the classic square soft reset button combo?
[5:07:07] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus going to have to wait til 'world travel' to get more rages now
[5:07:09] <A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can get back here fairly soon. You just jump into Baren Falls again and you wind up back at the Veldt.
[5:07:09] <+LastHazzerd> no cat
[5:07:11] <+DGenerator> RIP Gau functionality
[5:07:18] <crimsonharvest> its ok though, really not a lot lost
[5:07:21] <dds333a> moving
[5:07:22] <TheNix> Probably won't be using Gau much then, no big deal
[5:07:23] <+pectusumbra> will have to wait for later
[5:07:24] <linSP> good luck finding cat later

[5:11:29] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Good stuff
[5:11:32] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:11:33] <Shazbeaut> For Lola Bunny
[5:11:34] <majindusto> Level will not go up
[5:11:36] <pumspreadart> How ya liking the game so far ?
[5:11:36] <arkv01> I know elden rings massive but I wish we had ff6 twice a week instead VoHiYo
[5:11:37] <%CaptainBeird> woolie just comes back and gau's just jacked
[5:11:38] <+LastHazzerd> LUL
[5:11:42] <Drusain> It won't take long Woolie
[5:11:43] <+Jessie_Lockhart> You wont need too long
[5:11:43] <+Jiggisnipe> why not both Kappa
[5:11:45] <stevenellis386> every ff has its bangers!
[5:11:48] <+GarouFGC> StrayCat and Lopros should a few of your first take aways from the veldt
[5:11:53] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The Axe Soldier
[5:12:00] <Drusain> Just stray cat for like 80% of the game
[5:12:02] <dds333a> Axe man
[5:12:03] <%Glock3bb> None right now, I believe.
[5:12:03] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Or Sergeant???
[5:12:03] <Jay_san_swed> templar
[5:12:12] <majindusto> Gau will be JACKED as Fuck  lol
[5:12:13] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Templar yes thats it
[5:12:17] <KobeTeeth90> Bomb
[5:12:17] <Drusain> Templar is good
[5:12:19] <alrobot2014> i think the anguiform enemy that you're in a fight with RIGHT NOW gives a good one
[5:12:21] <Teradyne87> Lesser Lopros and Stray Cat
[5:12:21] <pumspreadart> lol
[5:12:28] <KobeTeeth90> Templar
[5:12:28] <rommlll> gau leaned LAVOS
[5:12:30] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus I think hornet (or similar) from Mt. Kltz gives Haste2
[5:12:30] <lotharrio> Templar (Thundara), Ghost (Fira)... Dark Side(Blizarra) but you might not have Dark Side because you did the Narshe puzzle perfectly.
[5:12:42] <+Jiggisnipe> I think he fought that
[5:12:46] <+polothegreatest> plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps
[5:12:47] <jaysondeez> you have that. Its the one that spits fireballs
[5:12:48] <%Glock3bb> The flying dragon
[5:12:48] <Teradyne87> Looks like a smallish dragon
[5:12:50] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I think you already got that rage
[5:12:51] <KobeTeeth90> Stray Cat
[5:12:52] <pumspreadart> the wyvern on the lethe river
[5:12:52] <jaysondeez> you just learned it
[5:12:53] <majindusto> GAU LEARNED "DARK MATTER"
[5:12:56] <+Jiggisnipe> I thought Gau returned on that
[5:12:56] <alrobot2014> you should already have lopros since Gau jumped back in on that
[5:12:58] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He already got that
[5:13:01] <Teradyne87> Gives you a party hitting fireball and makes Gau fly
[5:13:11] <linSP> Gau gau
[5:13:13] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah same ones to start
[5:13:16] <iambqb> stepped away for a sec, they wrapping up or just taking a breather?
[5:13:20] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[5:13:22] <rommlll> he's not that cool
[5:13:23] <pumspreadart> so unique, the best boi
[5:13:24] <jaysondeez> Another thing, when gau rages, he also inherits the weaknesses and immunities of the monster he rages as
[5:13:25] <ChrisPlaysThing> The strangest of Blue mages
[5:13:30] <Teradyne87> Thoughts on new characters?
[5:13:36] <+polothegreatest> Gau rou
[5:13:41] <alrobot2014> also Gau is more an analogue to 5's Beastmaster rather than Blue Mage
[5:13:46] <Jay_san_swed> not blue, beastmaster
[5:13:46] <lotharrio> Templar, Ghost and Dark Side (whuch you may not be able to get because you didn't trigger the Narshe trap) have level 2 spells as their specials.
[5:13:48] <+Jiggisnipe> Gau is uniqure. Idk if its ever been replicated
[5:13:56] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Gau is strong early with the right skills
[5:13:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:14:02] <ChrisPlaysThing> Ah, I never beat 5, or 6 actually
[5:14:08] <dds333a> @iambqb Wrapping
[5:14:12] <ChrisPlaysThing> beat everything fro m7 up though
[5:14:30] <anachronologist> This game actually does take a little bit to get to the CHOOSEUR SQUAD moment
[5:14:36] <KobeTeeth90> Top 5 ff6 Characters ,  Dylan Dylan Dylan Dylan Dylan, cuz he spit hot fire
[5:14:39] <Teradyne87> You can have a team of 4, but don't neglect B or C teams
[5:14:52] <wanderingdain90> never
[5:14:52] <anachronologist> @KobeTeeth90 You're too close man!
[5:14:52] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah for sure
[5:14:53] <rabbitlegs> yeah i don't know how much woolie knows about the late game
[5:14:54] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> No
[5:14:56] <dds333a> Not my first go LUL
[5:15:01] <anachronologist> I did
[5:15:01] <majindusto> You are not even  close  to getting  all characters   yet lol
[5:15:09] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I got it on a later play but not my first
[5:15:14] <arkv01> I got it after I resurrected her corpse :)
[5:15:15] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus it's worth it, and fun, to level the great option chars. Gau, Strago, Mog
[5:15:17] <anachronologist> @Jessie_Lockhart same
[5:15:26] <ChrisPlaysThing> Get German Spied on Kappa
[5:15:27] <dds333a> madman
[5:15:30] <lotharrio> Oh snap, a Franz is here.
[5:16:05] <pumspreadart> wow
[5:16:07] <dds333a> Exactly what happened with OG SMT and Kaneko
[5:16:10] <perfect_disaster> ooooooohh
[5:16:12] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:16:14] <lotharrio> Wait, that means Amano decided Leo was black?
[5:16:20] <dds333a> LUL
[5:16:22] <KobeTeeth90> LUL Banon
[5:16:22] <majindusto> GREEN HAIR SUPERIOR
[5:16:26] <ChrisPlaysThing> "Fuck that shit, THIS is lit!
[5:16:26] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus hey Woolie. how's the dreamcast I built for you? anything you need for it?
[5:16:27] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Sure seems like it
[5:16:32] <Teradyne87> Thoughts on the new characters you've met? Gau, Shadow, Cyan, and General Leo.
[5:16:48] <KobeTeeth90> @Teradyne87 they aite
[5:16:54] <raye0gin> there's some nice art from Nomura of the characters
[5:17:11] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Heck even anime he’a done art for is like a FF
[5:17:13] <raye0gin> from that time, not recently
[5:17:19] <Teradyne87> @Teradyne87 True
[5:17:34] <Jay_san_swed> angels egg. amano was so good in it
[5:17:34] <rabbitlegs> most of the monster art in this game is nomura
[5:17:50] <Wahrow> There's a Cutscene/ Archipel video where the pixel artist said she changed the hair color for Terra because it wouldn't stand out, so I think the artworks came first?
[5:17:52] <alrobot2014> yeah iirc nomura started monster design from 5?
[5:18:02] <rabbitlegs> yeah
[5:18:23] <theredfox930000> link had pink hair
[5:18:31] <dds333a> Ryu had red
[5:18:34] <pumspreadart> Aww man Kefka is great
[5:18:37] <+LastHazzerd> Dissidia is really great for visiuals and voice acting, i love onion knight
[5:18:41] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Do not look at ANYTHING in regards to Kefka regarding Dissidia
[5:18:45] <+Jiggisnipe> @Wahrow they could make the sprites 1st. Celes and Terra looked too similar so they changed it
[5:18:49] <rabbitlegs> he did monster design for chrono trigger too, but I dunno how much it was
[5:18:50] <majindusto> In japan...Terra is named "TINA" enigmaPuke
[5:18:51] <+LastHazzerd> oh yeah, maybe wait a bit tho
[5:19:00] <Drusain> I think it's too early for you to look at FF6 dissidia characters
[5:19:09] <pumspreadart> aight ya'll have a good one
[5:19:10] <raye0gin> his voice is great in Dissidia, I can't imagine anyone else playing him
[5:19:11] <Jay_san_swed> tina bradford
[5:19:14] <%kyh9> Dissidia Duodecim has some great character building for the protags and villains
[5:19:14] <+MysteryJ> @woolieversus in raw Japanese, Kefka is just angry and vulgar. it was Ted Woolsey who gave him funny/insane
[5:19:15] <rabbitlegs> dissidia kefka's va actually doing the laugh was kind of a power move
[5:19:32] <rabbitlegs> the same intonation but it actually sounds like a laugh rather than *snes noises*
[5:19:56] <lotharrio> Alaramed!
[5:19:58] <%kyh9> FF6 is pretty goofy at times, but intentionally so
[5:20:00] <wombatish> @Drusain Good point
[5:20:01] <+LastHazzerd> I watched a xenogears LP where the guy voiced Fei like Solid Snake, it was great
[5:20:05] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah I’m loving this LP. You two are making this so much fun! jessie2Heart jessie2Love
[5:20:05] <%Shad0wTag> @kyh9 Duodecim is a treasure, its on my favourite fighting games of all time
[5:20:06] <theredfox930000> down with light hearted chrisgDance chrisgDance spookyDolphin
[5:20:06] <%kyh9> My biggest complaint is future games aren't as goofy
[5:20:17] <%kyh9> @kyh9 DUODECIM FOR GET INTO FIGHTING GAMES???
[5:20:17] <majindusto> EDGAR enigmaCute
[5:20:26] <AntiGulp> This LP has been really fun to watch!
[5:20:27] <%Shad0wTag> @kyh9 GOD I WISH
[5:20:28] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I havent laughed so hard in quite awhile
[5:20:28] <rabbitlegs> the desert scene, in japanese he just does a generic expletive. "son of a submariner" was inspired
[5:20:30] <TrigunSTAR26> @woolieversus YO we getting GIFG Dissidia 012?!
[5:20:36] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie this is pretty much the energy of this game
[5:20:46] <alrobot2014> 1/16
[5:20:46] <%Sunriser41> 1/16 chance after each fight
[5:20:47] <wanderingdain90> I have never seen them last as long as you had him
[5:20:56] <%kyh9> Duodecim for Get Into Fighting Games????
[5:20:59] <alrobot2014> he just bails
[5:20:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[5:21:08] <+Jessie_Lockhart> “Peace!”
[5:21:10] <perfect_disaster> he ran away from me a lot of times
[5:21:12] <+pectusumbra> what did I miss?
[5:21:16] <anachronologist> He was also invisible for half the arc
[5:21:17] <arkv01> sub 10 but still happens
[5:21:18] <%townzzzzz> he liked the stuff you bought for him
[5:21:18] <+LastHazzerd> OOF
[5:21:25] <+LastHazzerd> so he stayed the full way for you
[5:21:26] <anachronologist> Cyan was so dang confused
[5:21:32] <alrobot2014> the upside is that he won't leave as soon as you hit Phantom Train
[5:21:38] <+LastHazzerd> oh good
[5:21:41] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I had a run where left RIGHT BEFORE the train
[5:21:46] <%Sunriser41> yea, he wont leave if he is dead or on the phantom train
[5:21:50] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> where he left*
[5:21:52] <Jay_san_swed> he ran right before the train for me on my first. still hurts LUL
[5:22:01] <dds333a> Like goddamn FE Hector
[5:22:06] <majindusto> Too be fair he was invisible  for most of the time lol
[5:22:12] <anachronologist> like a true coward
[5:22:16] <perfect_disaster> I actually thought they remove that detail for this game
[5:22:23] <fluffy_sauce> he can leave if you get into too many fights before the train
[5:22:34] <jorniev> its yojimbo and shadow a reference to something?
[5:22:37] <+Jessie_Lockhart> “Murder is okay bc they want to die”
[5:22:44] <Teradyne87> Good stream today guys
[5:23:50] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Life is complex
[5:23:52] <+pectusumbra> Damn missed the end. Good stream today anyway!
[5:24:10] <+Jiggisnipe> I think there might be one thing you were missing which would make the conversation more interesting
[5:24:16] <MatchStickMelee> Been doing great @WoolieVersus , thank you! Glad I got the chance to watch today. You guys did great.
[5:24:35] <BlackermanZX> now everhood is a net loss to your life like pat and fighting games Keepo
[5:25:35] <dds333a> @blackermanzx at least Pat still occasionally plays fitegames LUL
[5:25:36] <+StarPhoenix108> an open dialogue is necessary to appreciate art
[5:25:52] <+Jessie_Lockhart> No Maiden, eh?
[5:26:03] <stardustcrusad3r> really excited to hear your thoughts on it sugoiDansuhyper
[5:26:04] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @WoolieVersus Are you willing to watch Dissidia Kefka stuff on stream after you finish FFVI?
[5:26:07] <+LastHazzerd> 40+ min of chatting on elden ring, vry nice
[5:26:33] <Drusain> I think you'll get spoiled
[5:26:37] <jorniev> eeeeh
[5:26:46] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> It will spoil Kefka as a character. which is a concern
[5:26:48] <anachronologist> Dancing Mad is pretty good tho
[5:26:48] <%xerotwo> It might be spoilery
[5:27:00] <@Solidus_113> FF smash
[5:27:02] <+pectusumbra> There's a game with real good cutscenes
[5:27:08] <majindusto> Just  watch his  battle intros
[5:27:09] <+Jiggisnipe> arena fighter?
[5:27:10] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah Dissidia plays with the idea you’ve played the games the characters are from
[5:27:10] <iambqb> Reggie can peep it and decide if it's spoilers or not ay?
[5:27:12] <dds333a> 3d Zoe style Kappa
[5:27:13] <%Shad0wTag> Before it got ruined
[5:27:15] <$Rafraud> Reggie never played?
[5:27:17] <lotharrio> Almost certainly spoilers.
[5:27:18] <jorniev> theey really should have made it 1 on 1
[5:27:20] <OblivionSword1> like gundam
[5:27:22] <%Sunriser41> everytime someone says ff fighting game the only thing that comes to mind is god bless the ring
[5:27:24] <$Rafraud> Gundam
[5:27:28] <%Glock3bb> Like Ultimate Ninja Storm.
[5:27:28] <TrigunSTAR26> Ooh there’s a spoiler with his ex mode though
[5:27:30] <+LastHazzerd> the game draws a lot of reference to the source plots. but the intros/outros of fights with kefka should be fine
[5:27:38] <@Solidus_113> the PSP games are good
[5:27:41] <anachronologist> I played the one on PS4 a few years ago, was kinda fun
[5:27:48] <dds333a> It also has goddamn weird HP system
[5:27:50] <+LastHazzerd> Dissidia 012 is the best of the series
[5:28:01] <amritadyne> the PSP ones were the good ones
[5:28:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:28:04] <Lanxide> I just got here What did I miss?
[5:28:04] <+LastHazzerd> i do have faith in woolie's spoiler practices
[5:28:23] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! If you still have an FF hankering, consider Duodecim for Get Into Fighting Games
[5:28:30] <alrobot2014> the saddest part of NT is that it had such a nice roster just to be saddled by its gameplay
[5:28:43] <+LastHazzerd> Dissidia 012 is my favorite fighting game cuz it's a single player ARPG with the paintjob of a fighting game
[5:28:46] <anachronologist> Daily FFVI? I love you guys!
[5:29:11] <dds333a> GENE SPLICE
[5:29:15] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Weekly stream, daily vods
[5:29:16] <TrigunSTAR26> @woolieversus every Dissidia fighter has a super mode and a lot of them are spoilers
[5:29:20] <%xerotwo> JEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
[5:29:20] <$Rafraud> The PSP ones are far superior
[5:29:24] <$Rafraud> But its more for fun
[5:29:28] <@Solidus_113> you'll need a completed save file for them IIRC
[5:29:29] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus I will personally be a guest to explain Duodecim
[5:29:30] <Lanxide> Square Enix vs Namco Bandai when?
[5:29:39] <%TubeMan642> Get Klemps to help he loves those games
[5:29:40] <dds333a> Not always final bosses too Kappa
[5:29:50] <dds333a> It's like playing ASB
[5:29:53] <TrigunSTAR26> Yeye get clemps
[5:30:12] <$Rafraud> I wish the new one didn't flop
[5:30:14] <BlackermanZX> its spoiler city for forms for other than that is ok
[5:30:26] <jimgimp> GG
[5:30:28] <BlackermanZX> still dissidia is so fun
[5:30:29] <%AngryAsian5> GAME OVER YEAAAAAAH
[5:30:31] <anachronologist> Later
[5:30:33] <%xerotwo> woolieCRAB GAME OVER YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH woolieCRAB
