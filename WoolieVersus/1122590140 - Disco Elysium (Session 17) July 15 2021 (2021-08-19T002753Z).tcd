[0:02:49] <+Axellogic> Switch Pro is here
[0:02:52] <%extradopeness> not the vita
[0:02:58] <@Solidus_113> $540 with an SSD
[0:03:10] <%Lion_kun> Without exclusives, it seems pointless
[0:03:23] <+TheLastStar> 64gbs?
[0:03:25] <+TheLastStar> tf?
[0:03:26] <+Vivaciousx3> micro sd though
[0:03:28] <Equirah> it's hald the price of every other handheld pc
[0:03:29] <%arcturusblade> There are entire games that won't fit on the 64gb
[0:03:32] <Equirah> *half
[0:03:40] <%X2Eliah> 64 Gigs is maybe two games, or maybe 0.4 of a game.
[0:03:42] <fatblackfairy> PagMan ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:03:44] <kikoeru_san> you could even fit one modern CoD game
[0:03:47] <%WutangchickeN> that can hold 7% of COD Warzone LUL
[0:03:49] <iacus_> They have a microsd slot, fwiw
[0:03:51] <kikoeru_san> I mean couldn't
[0:03:51] <Kongro_> thats 50$ more than the Switch OLED btw
[0:03:53] <Equirah> scaled storage included
[0:04:03] <DextralMalin> tbf, not many AAA worth while nowadays. but that's my bad opinion
[0:04:10] <MaYaFGC> lets go
[0:04:15] <%townzzzzz> TINY
[0:04:22] <kikoeru_san> Oh shit
[0:04:28] <kikoeru_san> Woolie on to something
[0:04:29] <%TheGunrunner91> LETS GO
[0:04:36] <%dormoxx__> 🤔
[0:04:46] <kikoeru_san> oh man
[0:05:04] <+mechslayer71> that's specifically what they made it for yup yup
[0:05:18] <+Soliloquy123> Wait, what's the Strive tournament issue for someone out of the FGC loop?
[0:05:21] <primaryfire> the steam deck also seems to have an unshackled OS by the looks of it
[0:05:33] <kikoeru_san> Those prices might be bad for an individual, but for a venue like Xanadu is gonna be hyped if it's a good machine for Strive
[0:05:36] <Equirah> @Soliloquy123 ps5 is the worst version with the most input delay
[0:05:38] <%X2Eliah> ..... Wouldn't a laptop do just as well???
[0:05:41] <%eanscrale> TYPE LUMINA
[0:05:42] <%arcturusblade> @Soliloquy123 input delay that differs per platform. pc is the lowest
[0:05:43] <+mechslayer71> @soliloquy123 the most responsive version is pc, but pcs are huge
[0:05:51] <+Soliloquy123> Ahhhh. Thanks all
[0:05:59] <%WutangchickeN> @x2eliah I think it has to do with the fact that the specs are wildly different across pretty much every laptop
[0:06:02] <DianaTheAscian> it will prob have like no space
[0:06:08] <%WutangchickeN> this thing would have standard hardware
[0:06:10] <+Telraid> sd card support means you can get expandable storage
[0:06:17] <+Axellogic> getting that GG strive Perfume?
[0:06:25] <@Solidus_113> A laptop that you'd want to run strive well would still go around $700 new
[0:06:46] <Pt_Kamen> PATCHINKO

[0:07:29] <iacus_> also, it was one of the MMOs that's good as a game, apparently
[0:07:29] <+Soliloquy123> It'd be an XCOM2 machine for me
[0:07:31] <%TheGunrunner91> EndWar
[0:07:35] <%illtima> Red Alert 2 could make for a wacky LP
[0:07:45] <%Th3rd3> Starcraft 2 LET"S GO

[0:08:30] <%Juriasu> Kizzie is going to play chess
[0:08:35] <andre11dr> I find kinda bizarre that Woolie can keep up with Guilty Gear mechanics and Marvel 3 speed, but RTS are just to much
[0:08:44] <zanzibarian_hamster> Mahjong lp when?
[0:08:50] <mychael_bae> Evening yall

[0:09:03] <therat_giant> in case you do ever wanna chess, I'm sure you could get someone in the Twitch community on for a For Glory episode
[0:09:07] <%TheGunrunner91> Woolie vs Homeworld 2
[0:09:10] <%X2Eliah> @andre11dr tbh its likely down to the vastly different UI concepts
[0:09:13] <+Axellogic> Woolie needs them Axl time powers
[0:09:13] <DextralMalin> do they play point and clicks occasionally or are they avoided like the plague
[0:09:14] <DSD24> @Equirah Neo The World Ends with You
[0:09:21] <%Exiliator> Time is a valuable thing
[0:09:28] <+VGrekd> hbomax ads Pog
[0:09:35] <%bread_assassin> Neo:TWEWY uses buttons for example.
[0:09:39] <Equirah> oh, Neo and not Nioh. that's not how you pronounce Neo

[0:37:02] <CaribouStag> That's a big problem. Very not disco.
[0:37:05] <Dopamien> not even a little disco
[0:37:12] <chandlerofearth> a certified not disco moment
[0:37:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> very un-poggers
[0:37:18] <asdief_> I feel like Joyce should have told you this earlier
[0:37:23] <dukenux> "Nah, we're pretty fuckin' far from *disco*"
[0:37:49] <dukenux> So they'll send Navy Team Seals at Hardie's?
[0:37:49] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:37:51] <CaribouStag> thanks, encyclopedia
[0:37:51] <heemwizard> just like real life1
[0:37:52] <%mariothemaio> @asdief_ yeah agreed. she held this information back for her own ulterior motives in a kind of scummy way
[0:37:53] <heemwizard> !
[0:37:53] <DSD24> Ah yes Cazadors
[0:37:54] <Blank9> ceramic armor treated like it's power armor
[0:37:55] <%X2Eliah> thanks encyclopedia
[0:37:56] <%Juriasu> bUrself
[0:37:56] <%Jeshk0> ever seen a bee hive fuck up a wasp?
[0:37:57] <%FackuIkari> Thanks, encyclopedia
[0:37:57] <stadikt> thanks encyclopedia
[0:37:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's actually kinda relevant
[0:37:58] <+KageUzu> Geeeeeez
[0:37:59] <Bonebagmel> nature scary
[0:37:59] <%hax_metatron> AUTOMATIC WEAPONS
[0:38:04] <JetpackMcQuack> we have fancy muskets
[0:38:09] <heemwizard> you can actually mention this to evart
[0:38:09] <Johannen> Not Giant ones
[0:38:09] <reonome> bUrself
[0:38:11] <+Sir_Louis> The bee ball is a valid strat
[0:38:11] <therat_giant> two thousand people versus two people with fully automatic weapons, I've seen this movie
[0:38:13] <dukenux> that's how the japanese horets are irl no?
[0:38:15] <%kewlmyc> DAMN NATURE, YOU SCARY
[0:38:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea but that's one
[0:38:16] <+FlubbedPig> It's ONLY Japanese Bees that do that
[0:38:17] <heemwizard> those are only japanese bees
[0:38:19] <+Bouerd> Not all bees know how to do that
[0:38:19] <Blank9> only a few bees are able to do that
[0:38:21] <L99minaty> those are japanese bees, that only live in japan
[0:38:22] <brunoberserk> this is sounding like '' escape from bug island ''
[0:38:24] <andre11dr> I have actually seen that
[0:38:24] <heemwizard> not european honey bees
[0:38:25] <%Fabpsi_> Seraise Giant Hornets come with armor & laserrifles too
[0:38:25] <Bonebagmel> but you still loose a couple hundred PEOPLE
[0:38:27] <Treasure_Vault> The coin sound makes every every encyclopedia passive a bolt of seratonin
[0:38:27] <fistynopunches> Only one bee species figured that out
[0:38:28] <+Soliloquy123> But that kills ONE.
[0:38:28] <skyenoz> but hornets don't have automatic gunfire
[0:38:28] <drunken_lemur> @dukenux Japanese DEATH Hornets
[0:38:31] <%notsoy> only japanese bees do that
[0:38:33] <primaryfire> evrart actually brings up bees cooking hornets if you talk to him after joyce
[0:38:35] <%DiscoMatador> Only Japanese bees know how to do that
[0:38:36] <%X2Eliah> Woolie some hornets are very into hard saunas
[0:38:44] <brunoberserk> '' NOT THE HORNETS ''
[0:38:44] <%TheFabledAble> war of attrition is still REALLY BAD in a civilian urban area woolie
[0:38:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> Can't vibrate against semiautomatic gunfire, not effectively anyway
[0:38:46] <reonome> glorious japanese bees
[0:38:49] <Johannen> As ever japanese employ suicide tactics
[0:38:54] <andre11dr> Bees can fuck up some hornets
[0:39:06] <dukenux> Ah, so they're Pinkerton Panzerdivision
[0:39:07] <dukenux> lovely
[0:39:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit
[0:39:10] <JetpackMcQuack> don't miss
[0:39:17] <%mtlsars> communard tech
[0:39:19] <+mechslayer71> it would be a slaughter
[0:39:20] <%TheFabledAble> literally spray and pray
[0:39:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Not even, those are all broken
[0:39:22] <heemwizard> most of those dont work
[0:39:22] <Johannen> Not even
[0:39:25] <fistynopunches> The mercenaries could kill hundreds
[0:39:27] <%hax_metatron> LOVE THIS MOMENT! The game just ups the stakes, like, fucker, take this seriously.
[0:39:31] <chandlerofearth> muskets vs m16s
[0:39:32] <dukenux> GG Evrart
[0:39:33] <+commanderclaw> AKs vs Muskets
[0:39:33] <%Juriasu> even if the mercs can't win they'll kill a lot of people befire they go down
[0:39:40] <andre11dr> That's like WW1 weapons
[0:39:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's like revolutionary war soldiers v a modern day squad
[0:39:43] <brunoberserk> '' this is gonna be a curbstomp symphony ''
[0:39:48] <%Jeshk0> Hmmm
[0:39:53] <DSD24> But you should say 4
[0:39:53] <%Fabpsi_> but it really sounds all like 4
[0:39:54] <Johannen> @andre11dr How about pre WW1?
[0:39:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> Heres the thing, how did muzzleloaders become the standard? Even things like revolvers are relatively simple to make, you could reverse engineer that shit
[0:39:57] <therat_giant> LUL
[0:39:58] <skyenoz> but it IS 4
[0:39:58] <%king_wragles> You don't wanna say 4, but 4 is pretty on point
[0:40:03] <%X2Eliah> yep
[0:40:10] <stadikt> :)
[0:40:10] <CaribouStag> it's TRUE tho

[0:41:33] <%Gruhunchously> FOURTH WORLD?

[0:41:38] <DSD24> ID Tag Soldiers
[0:41:46] <%Jeshk0> isnt fourth world like extra-dimensional?
[0:41:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh boy PMCs and third world countries, what a great combo
[0:41:49] <Fuji808> Downwell is distinctly *NOT* Blackwater, ok? Don't think that Downwell is supposed to invoke the name Blackwater. Understood?
[0:41:50] <Treasure_Vault> Fourth World sounds like Dimension Wars
[0:41:58] <heemwizard> @Gruhunchously third world but in perputual war i imagine
[0:42:04] <brunoberserk> war is changed ...
[0:42:04] <Zomner> @Fuji808 I see, you mean Academi Kappa

[0:42:46] <%Gruhunchously> Like a global multiplayer lobby
[0:42:50] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's like kengan ashura but with war
[0:42:51] <tattleworm> we've got gig economy mercs irl now
[0:42:52] <+Sir_Louis> I would guess Fourth world would be places too poor to even be third world? like places that might not even be nation states I guess?
[0:42:54] <%hax_metatron> And also there's a song while you climb a ladder

[0:43:17] <DSD24> Shadowrun on 360 was a fun shooter
[0:43:20] <Fuji808> @DelgotHansto You could argue that Google helped to CREATE those fourth world countries.
[0:43:20] <andre11dr> You should probably at least do MGS3 before 4
[0:43:21] <die_hardman> @sir_louis I think of places like Guatemala or African countries
[0:43:23] <%Irridium> I live in the Comcast fiefdom :)

[0:44:06] <+Sir_Louis> @die_hardman I see what you mean but IRL these are textbook third world countries, fourth world would have to be even poorer

[0:45:56] <%Jeshk0> wow, i did not get this info on my run... FeelsBadMan
[0:46:05] <+Sir_Louis> @die_hardman I really don't know, ostensibly fourth world countries are just a subset of really poor third world countries, but that isn't really that satisfying to me as a definition? idk
[0:46:11] <andre11dr> Man P2 is wild
[0:46:18] <die_hardman> @sir_louis probably that one is
[0:46:28] <DSD24> @andre11dr It super is! fun game too
[0:46:34] <andre11dr> Too bad they won't ever re release it
[0:46:35] <+Sir_Louis> yeah yeah
[0:46:39] <Treasure_Vault> Kim is so good, but he needs you. This game is so good.
[0:46:43] <%Gruhunchously> Kim, shhh
[0:46:44] <%Lion_kun> Is Reggie okay? He has his hoodie up lol
[0:46:49] <die_hardman> @sir_louis island that it isolated from the rest of the world? Or places where they still hunt in herds?
[0:46:51] <+Bitscreed> Doing this bit at this time is interesting since by now Harry and Kim actually know far more than Joyce does. So Kim asking questions in this context seems more like a formality than actual info gathering.
[0:47:04] <iacus_> it's ok, Klaasje is her fugitive name
[0:47:28] <iacus_> anyway Klaasje is fucked anyway
[0:47:29] <+Sir_Louis> @die_hardman That makes sense, so called "uncivilised" places
[0:47:32] <Blackleafx> @Bitscreed and like Logic said, testing Joyce
[0:47:33] <Fuji808> @Bitscreed It does seem wise to match information, if for no other reason than to determine what she doesn't know.
[0:47:38] <dukenux> @Sir_Louis 1st, 2nd, 3rd world etc. also have historical connotations. i wouldn't put an equality sign between our and Disco's definition
[0:47:40] <%vaderxyz1970> @bitscreed They are being informed of the "Tribunal"
[0:47:47] <%Juriasu> yep Joyce is pointing at the sign
[0:47:51] <%mariothemaio> shhhhh authority
[0:47:51] <JetpackMcQuack> thanks authority
[0:48:02] <%Gruhunchously> And a matter of having automatic weapons and advanced armor
[0:48:03] <+Bitscreed> @vaderxyz1970 Ah, yeah, good point. I forgot that.
[0:48:09] <heemwizard> 22
[0:48:10] <dukenux> might be that the "4th world" is just an isola that was discovered later
[0:48:15] <%Lion_kun> Shut up Authority
[0:48:15] <Pt_Kamen> should talk to the scab leader for a very funny story
[0:48:19] <Johannen> Dont diss Authority, we need it for "that" thing
[0:48:21] <brunoberserk> HARD K
[0:48:26] <Blackleafx> RED CHECK BOIS
[0:48:30] <%X2Eliah> their authority comes from the automatic weapons...
[0:48:30] <+Sir_Louis> @dukenux defo, But the communist revolution in Disco seems to me that first/second world places would still be definable
[0:48:31] <%kyh9> 111111
[0:48:33] <+airchrysalis> oh boy hope we can talk to one of them today

[0:49:14] <iacus_> @die_hardman The going definitions as I learned are 1st world: Developed countries 2nd world: Countries in the process of developing 3rd world: Undevelopend countries It never included 4th world. Also, this classification is not in much use anymore I think. Considered problematic.
[0:49:15] <%Jeshk0> RIGHT TO WORK
[0:49:16] <Blackleafx> Ok thank god i wasnt misremembering, ok this is what unlocks the conversation

[0:49:56] <heemwizard> @sirrice77 yes do it
[0:49:58] <+Sir_Louis> @die_hardman Not quite, its all cold war divisions, first world are capitalist, second are communist, and third were too poor to take a side
[0:49:59] <%Gruhunchously> How do you do fellow activists
[0:50:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:50:04] <d41caesar> The church has been waiting for a long time

[0:50:18] <plsnolookatme> Joyce doesn't give a shit
[0:50:20] <Pt_Kamen> spike the special brew
[0:50:22] <Blackleafx> @die_hardman Third was "Non-aligned", but in reality pretty lefty
[0:50:33] <%hax_metatron> Joyce: "I can't do ANYTHING!" What a liar
[0:50:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> I love Kim's accent
[0:50:55] <Pt_Kamen> I love Kim
[0:50:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> I love all the accents in this game
[0:51:00] <%mariothemaio> I guess the question is more what could Joyce do, if they don't respect her anyway
[0:51:13] <Pt_Kamen> talk about everat
[0:51:15] <Blackleafx> 7
[0:51:20] <chandlerofearth> Kim sounds like the narrator of spongebob i love it
[0:51:29] <%therustystream> lol I feel the exact same about her Woolie
[0:51:30] <heemwizard> more than a month lol
[0:51:36] <%therustystream> she fumbled basically everything
[0:51:38] <heemwizard> in game wise anyway
[0:51:56] <dukenux> Joyce is unfortunately a very "my hands are tied" type of character
[0:51:56] <%hax_metatron> That's why day 10 is the last

[0:52:03] <%Juriasu> MAYBE sooner

[0:52:22] <Blackleafx> @WoolieVersus its Five days from now
[0:52:26] <Blackleafx> so day 10
[0:52:43] <andre11dr> So we have a time limit now
[0:53:21] <%AvroEltz> there is always a time limit, but its a very generous time limit
[0:53:22] <+Soliloquy123> I could never find a clear answer on whether or not this game actually has a hard time limit
[0:53:42] <%Gruhunchously> I believe it does, but we don't know what it is
[0:53:43] <dukenux> @therustystream yeah, and she does provide useful info, but she's there on Wild Pines' terms, and won't step out of the line
[0:53:52] <heemwizard> @Soliloquy123 the game automatically ends after a month in game days
[0:53:58] <heemwizard> according to the wiki
[0:53:59] <%Jeshk0> wow this is so much lore that i missed out on
[0:54:15] <%Gruhunchously> Heavy
[0:54:17] <%mariothemaio> you don't really need more 6-7 in game days tbh, even 10 is excessive
[0:54:17] <Blackleafx> CHEMICALS
[0:54:25] <Picia000123> It's really hard to hit the time limit, you have to deliberately waste time
[0:54:29] <%X2Eliah> There is no soul its just chemicals.
[0:54:30] <%Gruhunchously> It's all chemicals
[0:54:41] <%mariothemaio> especially because in this game time only passes in conversations/book reading and not exploring the map
[0:54:45] <Davimotion96> DON'T STOP
[0:54:46] <%Jeshk0> LUL
[0:54:51] <dukenux> @heemwizard that's a lot, i thought there was a hard week timeline

[1:05:00] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Traps for Phasmid?
[1:05:01] <TheD3rp416> you can talk to Joyce about Evrart or Evrart about the mercs
[1:05:02] <Indigo_Automaton> Talk to Joyce about Evrart
[1:05:07] <d41caesar> I would recommend the church
[1:05:25] <Treasure_Vault> Go look at those bullet holes with kim
[1:05:25] <+physicslawyer> You can talk to Joyce about Evrart's scheme's.

[1:18:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> That line changes because woolie chose ultralib??
[1:18:39] <%krispen_wa> Empathy calling ultralibs out
[1:18:41] <skyenoz> because you're an ultraliberal
[1:18:41] <%frickenmoron> Ultralib LUL
[1:18:53] <JetpackMcQuack> filthy communists
[1:19:00] <therat_giant> Turns out Ultralib really hates [THOSE GUYS] huh
[1:19:01] <+illusiveSaint> in terms of authority standpoint that's what it looks like
[1:19:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolie's Harry hates communists, after all
[1:19:06] <skyenoz> it changes depending on your political stance
[1:19:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> @skyenoz that's so fucking cool

[1:21:21] <mr_sups> "The ENDS justify the MEANS"
[1:21:22] <Johannen> "Extreme" Empathy is HARD CORE
[1:21:26] <Fuji808> @zanzibarian_hamster It would be the cheapest possible solution.
[1:21:27] <slix3431> Deathcamps of Tolerance
[1:21:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> @zanzibarian_hamster nah thats a new thing I think
[1:21:39] <%eanscrale> It's not called a sausage grinder for no reason.
[1:21:40] <therat_giant> Ultralib is very willing to put freeloaders against the wall huh
[1:21:41] <tattleworm> no pity for the bourgeoise
[1:21:44] <robert_orri> INCREMENTAL PROGRESS
[1:21:45] <heysamuel> this game deserved every award it got and more
[1:21:47] <%AvroEltz> its almost like the game has a message against extremism, nah
[1:21:47] <mr_sups> "The MASK comes OFF"
[1:21:51] <%hax_metatron> Except if you're a Moralist, you'd be sitting home supporting whoever is giving the firing orders LUL
[1:21:51] <%Dakuu75> I feel like we had this exact conversations in a previous disco stream. am I crazy?
[1:21:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> Based on the history exposed to us, I still believe it was communists lined up on the wall to die.
[1:21:53] <+atwitchical> Born to die world is a fuck 410 billion dead cops
[1:22:03] <primaryfire> ok capitalist
[1:22:03] <%DashXero> Extreme Empathy putting people on the wall.
[1:22:04] <%Gruhunchously> Granted, if you don't choose a side, your chance of going up against the wall goes us.
[1:22:05] <%Vigonept> yeah man you gonn hit. get ready to be hit
[1:22:11] <+Soliloquy123> That's the thing I see a lot of people fail to understand about moralism, they still put people against walls, they just had to fill a form out first.
[1:22:12] <OfficerMods> late did karaoke happen yet?
[1:22:12] <%Gruhunchously> *up
[1:22:16] <%purps26> the guys against the wall looked like the communist figures in the pawn shop

[1:22:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> @OfficerMods they are waiting for nighttime
[1:22:24] <heemwizard> but you didnt choose moralism
[1:22:27] <tattleworm> the extremely empathetic commandant putting an end to the ideological conflict
[1:22:28] <%Vigonept> but you chose capitalism
[1:22:31] <heemwizard> ...
[1:22:35] <iacus_> Conflict theory ar its extreme: Anyone who speaks of different ideas is a threat
[1:22:35] <+Bitscreed> @Soliloquy123 "Bring me the forms I needs to fill out to have these people blown away."
[1:22:36] <dukenux> extreme empathy would likely put you next to the wall
[1:22:40] <ToxInjection> but I want my revenge BibleThump
[1:22:43] <andre11dr> I mean that is what the vision quest pretty much are ,is like hei fucker ,how hard do you like this ideology
[1:22:51] <+Mattismen> I choose the seagull
[1:22:52] <heemwizard> @dukenux thats gommunism
[1:22:54] <+Axellogic> Im so not used to watchign this live I tried to pause
[1:23:02] <dukenux> @iacus_ thank you Hegel
[1:23:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not but gubment bad
[1:23:14] <BeteNoire> ...but that happened in a system that is "regulated"
[1:23:24] <zanzibarian_hamster> Deregulation to most people just means "I want drugs and guns"
[1:23:24] <BurdRightsActivist> I-I, YOU, WOW, I
[1:23:24] <%krispen_wa> EMPATHY CHECK FAILED
[1:23:28] <%X2Eliah> wow
[1:23:28] <%Jeshk0> big ooof
[1:23:35] <slix3431> Outer Worlds. They should pay for dying
[1:23:35] <heysamuel> holy shit
[1:23:40] <%Dakuu75> @Axellogic I know the feel
[1:23:42] <DianaTheAscian> wow fuck that person
[1:23:42] <Johannen> While replaying the game i found white stat checks infuriating, not enough variety to make up for gating content behind those
[1:23:42] <%eanscrale> Thats' America man
[1:23:45] <%X2Eliah> Yeah that person, FUCK THAT PERSON
[1:23:48] <%Irridium> or perhaps we eat them
[1:23:49] <iacus_> Up to you to make sure to buy the food that isn't poison
[1:23:50] <%vaderxyz1970> Remember every elevator ever installed was done by the lowest bidder
[1:23:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> "You see, everyone is fully responsible for themselves and nobody should help them" fuck these people.
[1:24:00] <Ecall10528> Woolie is failing empathy right now.
[1:24:01] <linSP> “Here’s a possible instant death home, cheap!”
[1:24:07] <dukenux> Yeah, i love when people use the ol' reliable "they should know better" when entire families died
[1:24:17] <iacus_> @Ecall10528 he's criticising them xD

[1:24:48] <reonome> @vaderxyz1970 doesn't that go for buildings in general
[1:24:49] <primaryfire> evrart/joyce resolution?
[1:24:50] <iacus_> Oh, still not going to church huh
[1:24:58] <%Gruhunchously> Nah, they were ignorant so they deserved what they got/s
[1:24:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> Church too
[1:25:00] <%hax_metatron> You can't get to island, but you can check boardwalk
[1:25:02] <slix3431> When Stickbug?
[1:25:03] <dukenux> Those kids really should study harder and invest in smarter parents Kappa
[1:25:03] <RENTARIM> Scab leader pls
[1:25:12] <+airchrysalis> talk to scaBBB
[1:25:15] <%krispen_wa> do it before
[1:25:15] <%vaderxyz1970> Sorry every Government building

[1:25:21] <chandlerofearth> epic scab battles of history
[1:25:22] <+Soliloquy123> @airchrysalis The map is a tourist guide that shows buildings that were planned for a great urban revival that never happened
[1:25:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:25:25] <%krispen_wa> scab needs something to lighten up the mood after
[1:25:28] <Fuji808> We haven't been to the church yet?
[1:25:32] <heemwizard> where are they going?
[1:25:34] <%insertdisc5> chat do you think woolie will ever go to the church
[1:25:36] <+mads_valentine> No.
[1:25:36] <heysamuel> scab's gonna be a heavy conversation
[1:25:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> Scab is rough. HUGE content warning on it, BTW
[1:25:44] <therat_giant> @BeteNoire yes, what is your point? bc I can understand being frustrated with this line of thinking but I fail to see how deregulation would in any way make less of these situations happen
[1:25:44] <+Sir_Louis> iirc the "pier" it means is somewhere else
[1:25:45] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus the boardwalk location will not proc until progress, dont waste your time
[1:25:46] <heemwizard> scab convo isnt really that big
[1:25:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @insertdisc5 he will eventually
[1:25:50] <+Vivaciousx3> i think the boardwalk trigger is near the feld building on t he boardwalk
[1:25:50] <%SomeAsianDood> Scab might need the snip snip
[1:25:52] <+mechslayer71> it really isn't
[1:25:52] <Pt_Kamen> @insertdisc5 after the event probably
[1:25:53] <%hax_metatron> RIGHT THERE
[1:25:55] <dukenux> Shouldn't you find the another mercenary first, before you confront the scab man
[1:25:59] <+ConLin_Arts_> timestop
[1:26:01] <shincadad> Analyzing the shot locations is later
[1:26:04] <heemwizard> i never did discover the shot from the boardwalk
[1:26:07] <%Juriasu> you got that sniper spot north of here when you went on the date
[1:26:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i never figured out how to look for the traces on the other locations
[1:26:11] <+Sir_Louis> Oh yeah you can't find that yet, don't worry about it
[1:26:16] <%AvroEltz> the boardwalk is very specific
[1:26:24] <Johannen> Not the right time yet
[1:26:25] <Treasure_Vault> That one is later.
[1:26:25] <vasily_kardanov> you won't be able able to examine boardwalk for a while
[1:26:28] <%krispen_wa> yeah the boardwalk one isnt available here
[1:26:30] <+Bitscreed> I never found the boardwalk shot location on my playthrough.
[1:26:32] <+mczarklesby> All the way right?
[1:26:38] <+physicslawyer> I don't think you can check the boardwalk yet.
[1:26:44] <+mads_valentine> Wrong part.
[1:26:45] <+ConLin_Arts_> it is timestop
[1:26:45] <primaryfire> @dukenux can't, joyce said the building south of the roundabout where the 2nd merc is is inaccessible
[1:26:45] <Johannen> Game is very Rail Roady
[1:26:49] <Elf_Planator> you'll come to the places automatically
[1:26:50] <BeteNoire> @BeteNoire I'm not saying deregulation is the answer. I'm saying this is not an example of regulation being helpful
[1:26:57] <+illusiveSaint> i don't think i ever found the boardwalk one
[1:26:58] <%krispen_wa> "boardwalk" is the wrong way to call the location you need to check
[1:27:02] <Treasure_Vault> You can't do this one yet.
[1:27:04] <andre11dr> He'll find it eventually
[1:27:07] <Treasure_Vault> Do other stuff first.
[1:27:14] <+Sir_Louis> the quest is unclear with how it means "boardwalk" you'll stumble upon it eventually
[1:27:16] <+Vivaciousx3> try ewitting the fence and going left
[1:27:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh shit, your glasses
[1:27:22] <Pt_Kamen> boardwalk goes around the Feld
[1:27:24] <+mechslayer71> wait, are they talking about the shivers check in the shack?
[1:27:30] <%purps26> yeah I think you can't do it yet?
[1:27:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mechslayer71 no
[1:27:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> The Encyclopedia glasses
[1:27:33] <+AWKWARDL0SER> RU trying to do the sniper location? This is not the pier
[1:27:37] <Pt_Kamen> that's the fish market
[1:27:39] <Johannen> @illusiveSaint Everyone finds it, it hides behind the Shivers
[1:27:42] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Cant reveal more w/o spoiling
[1:27:43] <%AvroEltz> try around the feld building
[1:27:43] <shincadad> Don’t worry about it for now
[1:27:44] <Treasure_Vault> The next sniper check is after a few quests, I promise.
[1:27:45] <buffcat> This task is deceptive. It's not able to be completed until you progress the main quest
[1:27:46] <+physicslawyer> I mean, you technically can, but it would require some other things before that.
[1:27:46] <Pt_Kamen> walk around the feld building
[1:27:47] <Reveresao> Isn't it the building where the guy with his son?
[1:27:48] <%purps26> Don't worry about it for now. You won't miss it
[1:27:56] <+OuchPotatoEX> it will come up naturally with progression
[1:28:05] <andre11dr> I think he has to do it later, this one is kinda wierd
[1:28:06] <Treasure_Vault> You can not find the next sniper spot yet.
[1:28:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh god yea no boardwalk isn't the right word for that location
[1:28:25] <+Vivaciousx3> can't get to the island quite yet
[1:28:31] <buffcat> Yes the description for this task is almost an outright lie
[1:28:32] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus At this point doing side quests is all you can do
[1:28:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> scab
[1:28:35] <Demoli_PT> no church still
[1:28:39] <ShanaEchidna> have they done karaoke yet chat?
[1:28:41] <Treasure_Vault> Talk to the cryptos?
[1:28:42] <Pt_Kamen> scab for bedtime story
[1:28:43] <ShanaEchidna> I just got here

[1:28:47] <heemwizard> eh
[1:28:48] <Elf_Planator> wait, no church?
[1:28:49] <primaryfire> dont overthink it
[1:28:51] <%vaderxyz1970> going to go pick a scab?
[1:28:51] <+physicslawyer> Scab confrontation time?
[1:29:03] <slix3431> @WoolieVersus Also just wanna brag. Got the tie first try.
[1:29:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SCAB

[1:29:05] <shincadad> Big man time
[1:29:05] <heemwizard> haha
[1:29:06] <chandlerofearth> I would do literally all the sidequests you want to do now, we're precariously close to a stopping point
[1:29:06] <%X2Eliah> church can b tomorrow,no rush

[1:29:11] <linSP> right to work!
[1:29:14] <%krispen_wa> SCABS ARE FOR BLOD CLOTTING
[1:29:16] <Johannen> Well defended? Meaning you will be wearing the armor of thier dead comrade?
[1:29:19] <zanzibarian_hamster> You are /probably/ wearing his comerade's gear when talking to him, that might be a bad move
[1:29:21] <ToxInjection> S C A B
[1:29:23] <+FanServ> @slix3431 why @ them with that lmao

[1:29:30] <%DashXero> Chat seems to be getting a bit backseaty....
[1:29:32] <%X2Eliah> @zanzibarian_hamster or a good one
[1:29:35] <+FlubbedPig> Walk up on him with a sword and a boombox
[1:29:38] <%vaderxyz1970> you do realize your wearing his camanding officers clothes
[1:29:44] <dukenux> Woolie, but have you considered: SCAB?
[1:29:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus If you're gonna do Scab leader, BIG content warning on that one for chat and Mihn.
[1:29:45] <Reveresao> Yes, wearing his dead friend's armor. That worked so well with Rene clothes LUL
[1:29:49] <andre11dr> Uhhh ,shouldn't he do the church before the scab
[1:29:50] <%AvroEltz> "why are you showing a picture of my dead friend while using his armor?"
[1:29:51] <ShanaEchidna> streamer do this BabyRage streamer do this BabyRage
[1:29:52] <Pt_Kamen> the blööd letting
[1:29:54] <Johannen> Woolie likes wearing dead men's clothes
[1:30:00] <%Jeshk0> woolie really should use the boombox more. get those tunes pumping!!
[1:30:00] <%Proxzo> When did woolie become Sundowner?
[1:30:01] <therat_giant> @BeteNoire if anything I'd argue it's a failure of accountability and communication for the structural integrity since there were a good amount of complaints relating to if the building was "to code", but these reports weren't relayed to the residents. Not looking to argue in twitch chat tho, have a nice night!
[1:30:05] <%purps26> Stop backseating. He isn't going to miss anything. He's fine
[1:30:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> This is a boss, just not in the way you're gonna like
[1:30:15] <%krispen_wa> oh boy, here we go...

[2:21:21] <%Dakuu75> I wanna hear her say, in an old lady voice "Come back when you got a warrant~"
[2:21:23] <Pt_Kamen> Shiver said "under the Floorboards"
[2:21:26] <+anoldtoilet> shivers is cheating and spoiling the game
[2:21:26] <%Vigonept> put locusts in the shack
[2:21:40] <+Afrobrawler> it wasn't interactable when shivers said that
[2:21:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:21:48] <Johannen> @anoldtoilet To be honest it was not Shivers but the Revachol itself
[2:21:50] <%Dakuu75> omg, Harry looks omega-fucked in that portrait. lol
[2:21:59] <%Irridium> 4AM? Day's half over!
[2:22:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Dakuu75 i mean, he looks omega-fucked all the time
[2:22:11] <+anoldtoilet> isnt that what shivers is, like your supernatural connection to revachol
[2:22:12] <elshadow7> Oh here we go
[2:22:14] <+anoldtoilet> idk

[2:22:46] <Pt_Kamen> searchlight division is a good one
[2:22:49] <Johannen> @anoldtoilet Shivers is your feeling, while sometimes Revachol connects to you thru that
[2:22:52] <%krispen_wa> is shivers pale related? like the memories of the pale giving you insight into the rest of the world?
[2:23:01] <Picia000123> this one is good
[2:23:02] <%Dakuu75> can we romance her? (ca we romance Kim????)
[2:23:09] <elshadow7> They already have Col do ma ma daqua though.
[2:23:11] <Picia000123> @Dakuu75 nope to both
[2:23:17] <%Dakuu75> aawwwwwww
[2:23:20] <serioustguy> you don't need this
[2:23:22] <heemwizard> EVEN MORE PERCEPTION
[2:23:27] <%vaderxyz1970> that's deep
[2:23:29] <Johannen> More perception
[2:23:30] <%mariothemaio> disco elysium dating sim when
[2:23:32] <%Gruhunchously> It's decent but you don't need it
[2:23:39] <%purps26> you can probably drop one that gives you money
[2:23:41] <Picia000123> Yeah, perception gets so many points, it's kinda ridiculous
[2:23:41] <TheD3rp416> I think you're financially secure enough to get rid of Fifteenth Indotribe
[2:23:42] <%krispen_wa> they dated her and it said you need to be sober for a year before she considers it
[2:23:51] <%Vigonept> people spoiling everything for this man
[2:23:51] <tattleworm> i'd lose dob generator probably
[2:23:55] <elshadow7> 15th indotribe could go I guess
[2:24:00] <1miklu> yeah indotribe is not that useful now
[2:24:06] <heemwizard> indotribe could go
[2:24:06] <%krispen_wa> coin keep
[2:24:07] <%purps26> you don't need more money
[2:24:10] <Johannen> Indotribe outlives its usefullness
[2:24:11] <+anoldtoilet> @krispen_wa maybe? i dont think its 100 percent clear but theres an implication harry's spent some time in the pale when the old driver starts talking about memory loss and time compression
[2:24:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wompty

[2:27:49] <+mechslayer71> @king_wragles it builds. also its atmospheric, works better in context of the moment. the moralistic vision quest track is also great

[2:57:17] <Inqy833> Most got sold into slavery didn’t they?
[2:57:17] <dukenux> Remember that one time Constantinopole was utterily sacked by fellow christians
[2:57:19] <Chatterbox1991> Supposedly the Saracines begged the Templars to cease out of not wanting to massacere children @WoolieVersus
[2:57:22] <Lelfro> psychological damage dealt to the enemy
[2:57:23] <andre11dr> Snooker
[2:57:25] <%Gruhunchously> Dolres Dei was a Europa Universalis player
[2:57:32] <Blackleafx> Also remember that before the crusaders ever got to the Holy Land they spent a few years murdering as many Jews as they could
[2:57:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:57:35] <%derap41> Ciri?
[2:57:36] <KaiserMario> Pope was like: "Am I out of touch?"
[2:57:37] <%DashXero> @Inqy833 Yup.
[2:57:41] <JetpackMcQuack> they were repelled
[2:57:44] <Johannen> Now think about Board Game of Suzeranty and the message
[2:57:46] <cutemuteprude> I mean, none of the crusades worked
[2:57:52] <%purps26> stop spoiling the crusades i haven't got to that arc yet
[2:58:01] <skyenoz> @gruhunchously yeah pretty much
[2:58:05] <Bedllama> I don't think the Children's Crusade ever got much support from church or state, they just sort of... didn't stop it on multiple occasions.
[2:58:06] <XRunnerguy> I think I recall a bunch of those crusader kids dying on the ships during a storm
[2:58:06] <Lelfro> oh man, i was about to read that, how dare you spoil that!
[2:58:09] <Equirah> @cutemuteprude there were more crusades than just the templar's
[2:58:10] <%mariothemaio> @purps26 Stardust Crusaders LUL
[2:58:10] <marcomatame> Christianity Lore: monkaS, Christianity: ResidentSleeper
[2:58:11] <andre11dr> Well it did some mental damage to someone probably
[2:58:22] <+Beetlewins> Children's Crusade was not sanctioned by the church and there is debate over whether it should be called a crusafe because of it. Which rather misses the point that a bunch of kids were manipulated into it
[2:58:22] <dukenux> @Inqy833 probably, many have simply not walked far, but the rest was lost

[3:01:03] <luftraumm1> I don't remember him having much to say
[3:01:11] <LeotheHuntsman> @kingra i've beat the game, kim usually just comes across as too pragmatic to let that happen to him
[3:01:15] <zanzibarian_hamster> Would that be like saying jesus was a layabout hippie to a hardcore christian?
[3:01:17] <Teras_ode> re-do for content Kappa

[3:01:35] <unthought> Now that we've covered up all the damage with zirconium oxide
[3:01:44] <Strigiform> Looking like dick mullen becoming a space marine
[3:01:47] <luftraumm1> an important part of kim is that he USED to be moralist @woolieversus
[3:01:54] <ingman112> He’s not unsympathetic to that, he acknowledges the problematic history. Like he said, he USED to be a moralist in his Younger years
[3:02:07] <1miklu> shirt also gave +1
[3:02:08] <akajaybay> I wouldn't be surprised if every response gets the glasses cleaning no comment reaction.
[3:02:11] <linSP> their religion is responsible for the technology and advancements humanity’s made, innocences are literally speed runners of humanity
[3:02:22] <available_line> Andraste
[3:02:24] <skyenoz> kind of a mix of Pope and the Dalai Lama
[3:02:30] <JetpackMcQuack> More symbol than man

[3:02:33] <dukenux> They seem like the Chosen Ones in Matrix
[3:02:37] <BurdRightsActivist> @linSP She just be playing civ5
[3:02:40] <%derap41> Pope learned he was infallible 1000 years after he became pope
[3:02:42] <ingman112> She’s Joan of arc and Jesus and the Pope all rolled into one
[3:02:47] <+anoldtoilet> SEELE and NERV set up society to be ready for a fascist god-emperor to rule it and maybe the god emperor is an alien
[3:02:47] <the_angelon_experience> She's the PC in another game
[3:02:56] <%mariothemaio> I think what's so interesting is how the religious grounds of moralism also formed a political ideology that is considered centrism. it means "moralism", as a political thought, is basically a theology
[3:03:02] <+mczarklesby> It reminds me of the king in the little prince. He's 'infallible' in that he only orders what was going to happen anyway. That's how they see the innocence.
[3:03:04] <%livlinn> ye
[3:03:15] <%derap41> silence is acceptance
[3:03:16] <OfficerMods> does the pope poop?
[3:03:20] <iacus_> there is absolutely a cult of personality around the innocences, but unlike christianity, they were real figures that did things
[3:03:21] <%livlinn> Oh Niemeler

[3:07:20] <Renegadorade> The pyramids were build by 40 people

[3:08:00] <%Double_Tap_That> @krispen_wa Nah, because that's too "political" /s
[3:08:02] <iacus_> Kind of interesting to think if we could ever go back to that mentality. Like for space travel for example
[3:08:04] <dukenux> the great wall

[3:08:48] <ToxInjection> big Pale energy
[3:08:52] <%therustystream> la Sagrada Familia in Spain was one of the craziest things I've ever seen
[3:08:53] <dukenux> Okay, this is just an Apocalypse cult

[3:09:17] <%derap41> bubble universes?
[3:09:39] <naoi0> Woolie vs. god disco edition?
[3:09:52] <Pt_Kamen> it's entropy
[3:10:08] <dukenux> it causes entropy in your brainl
[3:10:10] <Blackleafx> the world has a prion disease
[3:10:14] <+FlubbedPig> I don't think it's saying that world comes after Pale in that sense. It means that there was a world (an isola) after the Pale.
[3:10:21] <+mczarklesby> I wanted to point out that the prion thing is ALSO in the game because the devs are making fun of a far right conspiracy theory about politicians all having kuru due to cannibalism.
[3:10:21] <%derap41> can't cure prions
[3:10:38] <+nuttbrain> Cuno is the key to all this
[3:10:51] <+mechslayer71> like the halo theme throughout the series
[3:10:52] <Bonkus_Maximus_> you must construct additional prions
[3:11:06] <Johannen> Magnesium based life forms are the Future
[3:11:11] <Blackleafx> @mczarklesby a LOT of people have blamed political beliefs on diseases
[3:11:12] <iacus_> is Kim visually calculating this too?
[3:11:14] <%Lion_kun> The pale is real.
[3:11:16] <heemwizard> its just a motto
[3:11:16] <1miklu> he did the rites when you took the body down
[3:11:19] <%derap41> Cannot handle this faith
[3:11:23] <+Vivaciousx3> its like atlking about space
[3:11:27] <%Dakuu75> overthinking
[3:11:32] <Blackleafx> God, I really hope the Disco book gets translated soon
[3:11:33] <zanzibarian_hamster> I think Kim just doesn't like thinking about it
[3:11:34] <Johannen> overthink
[3:11:36] <%Lion_kun> The pale is a fact.
[3:11:38] <Blackleafx> the stuff about the pale in it is wild
[3:11:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1414834352052215808?s=19
[3:11:38] <linSP> maybe Kim doesn’t like thinking about it
[3:11:39] <dukenux> the pale is not a question of belief tho
[3:11:44] <Zap_Rowsdower32> It's more that he's worried it'll make you freak out even more so you can't solve the case
[3:11:49] <%Jeshk0> i think he doesnt like thinking about it bc of how cursed it is
[3:11:50] <ariszed> I think it’s cuz he doesn’t like thinking about entropy of the pale
[3:11:55] <andre11dr> Welp that was like an hour of examining a mural
[3:11:57] <%mariothemaio> RCM answers to the Coalition, which was made by the Moralintern
[3:12:01] <Renegadorade> i think its just because he doesn't see it as relevant to the case
[3:12:05] <+illusiveSaint> it's like under god in the judicial sytem
[3:12:06] <Lelfro> Entropy is feminine, huh
[3:12:07] <%derap41> but not legally required too

[3:15:20] <jorniev> church is the coolest location
[3:15:25] <Blackleafx> About the fact that "the pale" is called "the grey" in France. The original Estonian script of the novel has it as "the grey" in Estonian too, but I think "pale" works a lot better as a concept and im glad the developers leaned into it. like, grey just conveys... grey. Pale conveys a sense of washed out, faded, a bit more unnatural than grey.
[3:15:30] <%Gruhunchously> WIN HER BACK

[3:42:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> Motorway south?
[3:42:22] <andre11dr> Now what do you take off
[3:42:22] <ingman112> Jamais vu’s fine to ditch
[3:42:22] <heartlesshealer> yeah think about what you want gone
[3:42:22] <jorniev> SOCEITY
[3:42:24] <+AWKWARDL0SER> WOMPty dompty
[3:42:28] <Zap_Rowsdower32> What does Motorway South do?
[3:42:32] <+Afrobrawler> Date is birth has no buffs right
[3:42:37] <%derap41> Wompty is really strong
[3:42:39] <Renegadorade> WOMPTY DOMPTY DOM

[3:42:49] <%Jeshk0> woolies is so rich tho
[3:42:51] <serioustguy> date of birth
[3:42:51] <elshadow7> Yeap
[3:42:53] <Tiittamari> superstar maybe
[3:42:55] <Deasmeister> precarious world I'd say
[3:42:56] <%king_wragles> Seems like a good one to replace
[3:42:56] <serioustguy> no way
[3:42:57] <%Fabpsi_> you dont really need motorway south anymore...or indirect modes of taxation
[3:42:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> You're not really doing much inland stuff
[3:43:03] <Dopamien> superstar cop is important 😡
[3:43:05] <Pt_Kamen> superstar is good for karaoke
[3:43:06] <elshadow7> Inland's easy to buff with clothes too
[3:43:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> time to get SOBER
[3:43:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> Honestly, you can just give Inland a point to make it up
[3:43:15] <skyenoz> Plus you already have enough inland
[3:43:24] <andre11dr> Inland is high anything because you're using the notebook
[3:43:27] <tattleworm> 20 hours of being exceptionally bad at punching
[3:43:33] <elshadow7> -2 from wasteland of reality
[3:43:38] <heartlesshealer> Going sober brings you down
[3:43:40] <+Sir_Louis> Coach is not happy
[3:43:44] <%Gruhunchously> Motorway South grants a big buff to a check later on, but you'll probably be able to get it regardless
[3:43:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> new thought brings it down by 2
[3:43:49] <$JobbedBone> insomnia BibleThump
[3:44:01] <linSP> being sober makes you less fighter
[3:44:02] <skyenoz> Level up physical instrument for now
[3:44:07] <elshadow7> Shivers at 9 holy shit
[3:44:07] <%DiscoMatador> yee
[3:44:10] <+Sir_Louis> save the point for now
[3:44:13] <teflonbilly777> Man, I am WAY behind on this playthrough. I just saw Woolie share the speed with Cuno this morning
[3:44:15] <JetpackMcQuack> what are we instrumenting
[3:44:16] <serioustguy> blue shivers
[3:44:19] <$JobbedBone> quitting cold turkey is rough
[3:44:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> hope you don't have to make any PI checks
[3:44:23] <iacus_> yeah can hold on to points for checks
[3:44:30] <Johannen> Not a great idea
[3:44:31] <elshadow7> You might wanna get some Logic, being a detective and all
[3:44:34] <Fuji808> This is legitimately a powerful ability, tho.
[3:44:36] <Teras_ode> does Shivers do the thing that other stats do when they get "too high"? Offer fake/trap answers?
[3:44:40] <Fuji808> Powerful thought, I mean.
[3:44:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> karaoke time?
[3:44:51] <$JobbedBone> even lethal, for a lot of people in harry's levels of alcoholism
[3:44:56] <Johannen> Too soon for karaoke i think
[3:44:56] <skyenoz> @teras_ode not really
[3:44:58] <teflonbilly777> Crabman is a bro
[3:45:08] <JetpackMcQuack> 👀
[3:45:09] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Shivers does not
[3:45:15] <%derap41> @Teras_ode just goes very far off into stuff that isn't really relevant
[3:45:16] <Dabrikishaw> When did Woolie get Whoompty Dom Center?\
[3:45:24] <1miklu> @Dabrikishaw yesterday
[3:45:26] <%vaderxyz1970> @dabrikishaw yesterday
[3:45:30] <tattleworm> it's also the only one with an alternate ending for the main game, though it's kind of a game over
[3:45:32] <skyenoz> Yeah the moralist questline is VERY interesting
[3:45:36] <andre11dr> So yeah, time for some hardcore Electro
[3:45:38] <Johannen> @Dabrikishaw Talking to the man and his son near the Feld Electric this morning
[3:45:47] <teflonbilly777> Have they investigated the silent spot in the church's conection to The Pale, yet?
[3:45:50] <OfficerMods> karaoke next time...
[3:45:53] <mr_sups> This game fucking rules
[3:45:54] <iacus_> I'm glad the gave the "moralist" branch some content for the FC. Before it was basically "they're boring"
[3:45:58] <Dabrikishaw> Okay, I'll watch the stream archive from yesterday then.
[3:45:58] <%vaderxyz1970> dude
[3:45:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> karaoke soon
[3:46:00] <skyenoz> damn @teflonbilly777 no and DUDE
[3:46:06] <Johannen> We made it to church before the END....YEAH
[3:46:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> Hey @WoolieVersus might wanna tell Mihn to put a big content warning on the Scab leader episode.
[3:46:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> it draws ever nearer
[3:46:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> good stuff
[3:46:14] <Teras_ode> gotcha, so not that much "false gut feelings", thanks guys
[3:46:17] <Pt_Kamen> Game just keeps going with those curve balls
[3:46:21] <jorniev> next episode... the flame of corruption cop
[3:46:23] <Davimotion96> @teflonbilly777 They just got into the church
[3:46:25] <die_hardman> Hoo boy, scab leader’s story was something.
[3:46:37] <AngryAsian5> Great sesh
[3:46:41] <skyenoz> damn can't wait for the next session
[3:46:45] <andre11dr> Today was good, except for that one part
[3:46:45] <teflonbilly777> Damn, they've been doing a lot of side stuff then
[3:46:59] <+mr_sir132> crazy how this scene is in the same game as whatever the fuck the mercs are doing or saying
[3:47:12] <jorniev> did they listen to the story of the scab leader?
[3:47:20] <+mr_sir132> they did
[3:47:21] <%Dakuu75> I'm glad he hit the church finally. I think my favorite part might be next stream
[3:47:29] <teflonbilly777> Well, it sounds like Woolie's found more out about Dolores Dei
[3:47:39] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:47:39] <%vaderxyz1970> This game holds no punches
[3:47:50] <andre11dr> This goes hard

[3:47:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:48:02] <iacus_> there's always a darker human
[3:48:02] <%Gruhunchously> Co-Hoi style
[3:48:04] <mr_sups> This game does not hesitate to get Uncomfortable. And I love it.
[3:48:05] <andre11dr> IT GOES AS HARD AS IT CAN
[3:48:10] <%Jeshk0> harry is a total mess. those other guys? ooooof
[3:48:11] <%xcompleasedad> He makes Apocalypse Now look TAME.
[3:48:12] <%Dakuu75> flashbang
[3:48:23] <%derap41> shooting kids wasn't enough?
[3:48:24] <jorniev> did they give you a content warning?
[3:48:29] <%vaderxyz1970> The closest you get I think is shooting Cunoesse I think?
[3:48:32] <andre11dr> Yeah these Swedes don't hold punches
[3:48:33] <%Vigonept> evil
[3:48:36] <Picia000123> Hey guys, remember 'nam?
[3:48:39] <iacus_> @andre11dr Estonian
[3:48:41] <skyenoz> yeah Harry can be a surface level piece of shit but at least he isn't THOSE guys
[3:48:42] <teflonbilly777> Who is he talking about?
[3:48:44] <marcomatame> @andre11dr Estonians reeee
[3:48:50] <andre11dr> Or wait ,right Estonians
[3:49:00] <%derap41> ugh
[3:49:07] <bookchin> Estonia used to be Swedish, tbf
[3:49:11] <heartlesshealer> damn
[3:49:15] <Teras_ode> classic E fucking A
[3:49:17] <%Irridium> remember punkbuster kids
[3:49:22] <@Menitta> aw streams done
[3:49:32] <heartlesshealer> Entertainment Annihilation
[3:49:46] <iacus_> @skyenoz Who's to say that one possible Harry somewhere wouldn't commit war atrocities when put into a combat situation though? It's all about context
[3:49:48] <teflonbilly777> Did they have the moment in front of the Whirling Rags this stream?
[3:49:50] <%Vigonept> good job both y'all
[3:49:56] <%Javaa01> Well more specifically, the thing that got Battlefield 2 delisted for was the Gamespy master server getting killed
[3:50:05] <$JobbedBone> yep
[3:50:06] <Mr_Zero5232> Ah, showed to to find out I’m late as fuck
[3:50:08] <iacus_> Oh no. Fuck the algorithm
[3:50:09] <Teras_ode> wonder why Kappa
[3:50:25] <marcomatame> Is that Walmart tweet dunking on Smash by saying "rollback netcode" with a pic of NickSmash real? I really hope it's real
[3:50:27] <Deasmeister> The titles on the disco eps are gold
[3:50:30] <@Solidus_113> your videos will no longer show up in recommends
[3:50:37] <Johannen> we are all suprised to reasons Kappa
[3:50:37] <$JobbedBone> I have to fight to see jerma's stuff, ever since he switched to once a week
[3:50:43] <%Vigonept> if you arebt click bait get fucked
[3:50:54] <teflonbilly777> Man, I gotta catch up on anime episode for manga moments like this
[3:50:54] <heartlesshealer> Only the Castle SuperBeast clips show up in my recommends
[3:51:00] <tattleworm> i figure it's people who don't watch the clips because they've already seen the full thing which youtube interprets as "oh, they don't watch this channel anymore"
[3:51:03] <Mr_Zero5232> If you ain’t bitching about something get buried
[3:51:08] <%Valask> Valask subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! I carved the Unlimited Blade Works chant on the desk I took my last final on in HS.
[3:51:14] <iacus_> The algorithm is optimized for viewing minutes, not for quality content, sadly
[3:51:19] <primaryfire> oh I've experienced that before with channels where I watched every video but recommendations suddenly stopped
[3:51:34] <teflonbilly777> The algorithm can get deez nuts
[3:51:37] <arkv01> youtube wants you to one thing and one thing only or ELSE
[3:51:41] <andre11dr> Oh YT your a riddle to me
[3:51:41] <primaryfire> and it was right after they made a video talking about ubisoft abusing employees
[3:51:44] <bookchin> It is basically YouTube hogging controll of the algorithm away from the users
[3:51:50] <%Irridium> yeah I've long since stopped bothering listening to youtube and just checking the channels I watch manually
[3:51:53] <iacus_> yeah, it's getting to the point where I barely see the videos of the channels I actually subscribe to
[3:51:58] <bookchin> Who is Mybelle?
[3:52:03] <%Irridium> on my toes
[3:52:05] <%Vigonept> hey I'd support yall no matter how much youtube poisons you
[3:52:09] <mr_sups> No, but I'm watching it all anyway
[3:52:16] <1miklu> it is now, mr. reggie
[3:52:22] <andre11dr> My bell always ring
[3:52:23] <%Valask> apparently watch time is key nowadays

[3:53:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh no the girls are LAUGHING
[3:53:56] <marcomatame> Reggie that's wrong, school kills the adventurous spirit, it doesn't encourage it.
[3:54:02] <%p4ntless> girls are always watching, you are never safe
[3:54:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> OH NO
[3:54:06] <Prevot> they looked at Archer and went "oh no he's hot"
[3:54:19] <teflonbilly777> @iacus_ You know what it is
[3:54:30] <+TheLastStar> artesian builds you say
[3:54:33] <bookchin> That is the worst thing about Archer
[3:54:36] <andre11dr> Well maybe one of the girls went, "damn, that's so hot" you don't know
[3:54:40] <iacus_> I know what those two things are separately, but together?
[3:54:59] <teflonbilly777> @iacus_ Maybe it's more of an OnlyFans idead
[3:54:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
