[0:02:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:02:46] <+Dragstruction> the only character worse than Sasuke is bakugo. he doesn't have the power to back up his arrogance.
[0:02:53] <ThornJay> oh fuck its happening
[0:03:10] <Morning_Asakura> bakugo is such a bad character im baffled people like him
[0:03:13] <%SuperKirby24> I need to use these channel points more LUL
[0:03:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> Bakugo really is store brand Sasuke huh....
[0:03:21] <srsonofthesun> No Sasuke, you can't destroy the Dokapon village hidden in the salt
[0:03:22] <%Kriss1827> bakuho isnt great.

[0:03:26] <%Kriss1827> bakugo*

[0:03:28] <+CoronetChris> woolieYE
[0:03:29] <fist_wizard_jay> People are suckers for redemption arcs or curves
[0:03:30] <%ChoculaUltra> Hirokoshi really made Bakugo too hateable in the early part of the story. One of his first onscreen interactions is literally telling Deku to kill himself lmao.
[0:03:36] <ThornJay> bakugos "damaged"
[0:03:37] <+Dragstruction> bakugo and kirishima
[0:03:39] <%GrassCannon> His whole thing is that he's a spoiled brat who was never told "no"
[0:03:40] <%QuantumCholo> BACK IN
[0:03:49] <Morning_Asakura> @ChoculaUltra shit i forgot that part LUL
[0:03:52] <%Binary_Fireball> the best part of waking up is a ninja in your cup
[0:03:52] <%GrassCannon> How they can say that in Season 1 and still have people make excuses for him is beyond me
[0:04:00] <Amoeba_Bait> brucegGoosehead brucegGoosewing
[0:04:01] <%lewdskeletor13> wooliePOYO
[0:04:06] <fist_wizard_jay> Bakugo veeery very slowly is inching towards decent. But he still is an asshole tbh
[0:04:12] <%lewdskeletor13> brucegGoosehead brucegGoosewing
[0:04:18] <%ChoculaUltra> @Morning_Asakura its p bad LUL
[0:04:23] <Amoeba_Bait> Goose squad
[0:04:25] <ThornJay> wasn't bakugo always the most popular for the japanese audience?
[0:04:26] <%Kriss1827> bakugo will at best be not hatable, never likeable
[0:04:33] <+Dragstruction> how do you get kidnapped like 4 times and still threaten people?
[0:04:34] <BigManLugan> sweet time for more ninjas
[0:04:35] <srsonofthesun> I think I'll also install nuns 4 to play alongside

[0:04:38] <fist_wizard_jay> Maybe even neutral
[0:04:47] <Morning_Asakura> @ThornJay never trust japanese character polls
[0:04:48] <%ChoculaUltra> I thought Todoroki was Japan's fave in terms of MHA chars. Could be super wrong tho.
[0:04:59] <%Kriss1827> @fist_wizard_jay Big Neutral
[0:05:11] <CJL_13> Bakugo is number 1 in both Japanese and USA polls
[0:05:14] <fist_wizard_jay> Bakugo for Chaotic Neutral? lol

[0:05:24] <%ChoculaUltra> holy crap, really? Bakugo?
[0:05:26] <countgaculatv> Todoroki is just Gaara with a slightly better dad
[0:05:27] <+hawk_rush> love this song so much

[0:06:34] <Morning_Asakura> persona 3/4 remaster ever?
[0:06:35] <NeroInfinite> That Persona 5 music
[0:06:41] <%Irridium> @Dragstruction Mirio. Ir as I like to call him, Bethesda Man.
[0:06:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> early My hero takes a lot from naruto that it kinda irked me tbh. but I've been reading the manga and it seems it's kinda doing it's own thing now
[0:06:47] <+WolfHavocX> doodHey
[0:06:48] <C4m3r0n0409> I love P5 so much
[0:06:51] <fist_wizard_jay> I thought I heard about a leak or something from French Amazon that Persona 5 Royal might get a PC port
[0:06:59] <%Kriss1827> @morning_asakura my dream is persona 3/4 remakes on switch and ps4 Kreygasm
[0:07:06] <NeroInfinite> PogChamp
[0:07:10] <+Dragstruction> Mirio Togata I'd figure would be the new favorite. he has so little detail in his face id imagine they tried to make him cute as possible
[0:07:13] <%vextalyst> Cheer500 Yo woolie for the love of god be sure to watch the Anime version of Kakashi vs Obito. It is my pick for best hand to hand fight in ALL of anime. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzeQktXCHek Also Hell yeah to XCOM SNEK. I'd make it work somehow
[0:07:16] <C4m3r0n0409> Early Naruto takes a shit ton from Hunter X Hunter kinda hate that
[0:07:17] <%Solidnick18> wooliePOYO
[0:07:17] <ahairysuprise> @morning_asakura smt 5 has to come out first

[0:07:24] <+PulsinFufu> inochiDerp i was just watching dokapon kingdom part 3 pls tell it gets saltier later inochiHype
[0:07:24] <%ChoculaUltra> My Hero takes a lot from every best character defining arc of 90s Marvel comics and gets praised for it but that's a discussion for another time.
[0:07:27] <+bv728> Listing from French Amazon was announced as an error
[0:07:31] <CozyGUNNA> persona 3 and 4 need ports
[0:07:32] <Morning_Asakura> i think smt 5 is something we dreamed up
[0:07:32] <Shade075> I actually like Bakugo, I mean his first pick for a hero name was godamn KING EXPLOSION MURD4ER. That's both silly and awesome
[0:07:33] <saiyan24675> Hello my fellow ninjas
[0:07:36] <%Kriss1827> @cozygunna i still need to play them :(
[0:07:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> @c4m3r0n0409 this is truth lmao

[0:08:31] <+Bluydee> I'm pretty sure Woolie can finish the game today
[0:08:34] <fist_wizard_jay> I’d trust him to blast me with a weak explosion to move me away from a fight, at the most

[0:48:51] <%Superbro64> sasuke nows some talk no jitsu himself I see
[0:48:52] <InfiniteSwagbito> @WoolieVersus This Orochimaru from here on out is super chill and laid-back.
[0:48:54] <%ggbhtg> All of these cutscenes are BALLIN ON A BUDGET NO JUTSU
[0:49:02] <@Solidus_113> Orochimaru downgraded to jobber status

[0:49:16] <biomegabear> this is nuts that sasuke is able to 1 on 1 this dude
[0:49:18] <Aracon_> lesser than jobber
[0:49:20] <hassanico2> Lay low, maybe they'll forget all that Mengele shit he did LUL
[0:49:21] <%ggbhtg> Orochimaru is holding that L, to be honest
[0:49:23] <+oscar_m510> Lame it like X TEKKEN
[0:49:26] <Aracon_> borderline irrelevant LUL
[0:49:28] <%arkv01> orochimaru's a simp now

[0:50:47] <%ggbhtg> Izanagi the rewriter jutsu is from the Danzo fight, and Izanami, the counter to that, is from the Kabuto fight
[0:50:50] <phatmac16> Not important
[0:50:52] <%optimasmaximas> @C4m3r0n0409 he never understood it in the first place and whether or not he does understand it now is therefore relavent
[0:50:55] <+Nobrev> Boruto
[0:50:55] <gekizenbu> woolie's gotta get back on the college program Naurto
[0:50:59] <%masterpiecejeremy> Woolie didn't do his homework? That's a paddlin'
[0:51:02] <%ggbhtg> He might wanna know it anyway chat
[0:51:10] <countgaculatv> Woolie you didn't do your summer homework?? Kappa
[0:51:14] <%ChoculaUltra> That very first chapter of Boruto with the flashforward was some cool ass shit and I will die on this hill. Everything else is ehhhhh.
[0:51:22] <%MisterArcanine> Here is your Naruto syllabus class
[0:51:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> is naruto this complicated or are they just making it seem more than it is?
[0:51:31] <phatmac16> Naruto 101
[0:51:33] <%Solidnick18> danzo
[0:51:35] <+NarcissistCactus> danganronpa
[0:51:38] <WG101> @FuqBoiSlim YES.
[0:51:40] <%arkv01> dango dango
[0:51:41] <VidulaSaix> Danzoronpa
[0:51:43] <%Dragstruction> danzo was the biggest waste of a villian. he just ran into the shurikens...
[0:51:45] <%andrei11dr> They come from Kishimoto Kappa
[0:51:46] <InfiniteSwagbito> @ChoculaUltra The only good parts of Boruto are when it's focusing on the old cast, which is a huge problem for the show about Boruto
[0:51:46] <chippa250> danganronpa?!
[0:51:48] <TheAceol> Just read up on Japanese mythology, you'll get a fuck-ton of references
[0:51:50] <irfan_> Izanagi was the "I win" button, and Izanami is the "nuh uh, you cant cheat" counter
[0:51:51] <C4m3r0n0409> @optimasmaximas Is it ever mentioned again tho
[0:51:53] <+Bluydee> reading the Boruto manga LUL
[0:51:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> @wg101 man...
[0:51:55] <%masterpiecejeremy> XCOM Chimera Squad LP coming??????
[0:51:56] <biomegabear> @ChoculaUltra I think its hard to write boruto when trying to get 2 demographics
[0:52:00] <countgaculatv> This is correct information
[0:52:01] <wendigo172> @choculaultra the Bort manga is pretty good right now imo
[0:52:03] <phatmac16> Watching Boruto
[0:52:06] <%jiggy_snipe> there are a lot of moving parts in Naruto
[0:52:07] <phatmac16> KappaPride
[0:52:10] <%MisterArcanine> Naruto x Danganronpa
[0:52:11] <countgaculatv> Bort manga is going hard in the paint
[0:52:11] <Personified134> oh boy the dumb orochimaru shit
[0:52:13] <%ggbhtg> @FuqBoiSlim Yes, but it's a bit more since Woolie is intent on getting the story through the game
[0:52:13] <+NarcissistCactus> ok
[0:52:20] <Jetsfantasy> Think about a person forcing an UNO win vs the reversal
[0:52:21] <phatmac16> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:52:22] <%MisterArcanine> Fuck I would watch that
[0:52:29] <beatfox15> Bort is still going on ? Lol
[0:52:36] <@Solidus_113> A little might be explained this session

[0:52:40] <VidulaSaix> Bort is neverending
[0:52:46] <%ggbhtg> Bort just introduced THE RIVAL into the anime
[0:52:48] <%andrei11dr> Izanagi=1up Izanami=Gold Experience Requiem
[0:52:51] <%optimasmaximas> @C4m3r0n0409 no pretty sure it's not; it's just them wanting to be thorough with woolie's knowledge
[0:52:52] <%Kriss1827> manga bort is kinda good atm
[0:53:00] <+MrRabbles> Susan <3
[0:53:07] <countgaculatv> It's just Shinto Gods Woolie

[1:11:51] <countgaculatv> 2nd Hokage is super racist
[1:11:52] <Vadrigar1994> Talk about how the Second Hokage subscribes to Phrenology
[1:11:54] <Mr_Rakjo> 2nd hokage always hated the uchiha @WoolieVersus
[1:11:54] <%jiggy_snipe> he's so pissed that everyone can use his jutsu
[1:12:00] <MarkUriah> Racist Hokage

[1:12:10] <%Jetzord> Tobirama got woken up from the dead again and had his day ruined by seeing an Uchiha
[1:12:11] <its_sinny> Tobirama "The Racist"
[1:12:13] <Malik1002> yeah dont mind him homie got an itchy trigger finger
[1:12:13] <countgaculatv> HIS RACISM IS WRONG
[1:12:14] <%gatorafan> Tobirama did NOTHING wrong Kappa
[1:12:15] <%optimasmaximas> minh is right
[1:12:16] <+GreenCMD> Tobimara, "red-eyes go die" Senju
[1:12:17] <MonsterEnvy> Remember Orochimaru has control over the four kage
[1:12:21] <phatmac16> HE’S gonna build that wall
[1:12:22] <gekizenbu> the ninja race war has been starting for forever
[1:12:26] <Arblaster_> Sasuke just ditched ISIS for Dr Mengele to talk to the founding fathers
[1:12:26] <%Dragstruction> TheIlluminati
[1:12:29] <%Superbro64> unless your itachi
[1:12:30] <+SilverInferno3> Tobirama totally could've broken out of it
[1:12:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> Also Hashirama scared his ass
[1:12:36] <TheAceol> He literally lifted a finger and scared THE FUCK out of everyone
[1:12:38] <gamewarden92> Last game left out what Madara does didn't it?
[1:12:41] <+ineek10> exception Hashirama could
[1:12:41] <saiyan24675> MInato is just why am I here I didn’t do anything to the Uchiha
[1:12:41] <jbees7> did the first auto break the jutsu?
[1:12:42] <Shishi1205> Sealed
[1:12:42] <CozyGUNNA> tobirama trump
[1:12:42] <%jiggy_snipe> @Arblaster_ LUL
[1:12:42] <%Kazuhira_Boat> MINH TALK ABOUT HIS BIG RACISM DONG
[1:12:44] <VidulaSaix> Tobirama "Uchiha Blood, you belong in the mud" Senju
[1:12:44] <WiredAbyss> Taliban redemption arc happening
[1:12:44] <%ChoculaUltra> the implication is that Tobirama and Hashirama at any time could end the Edo Tensei control part just like Itachi did.
[1:12:45] <+SilverInferno3> I think in the anime/manga Orochi literally says he might not be able to hold them back
[1:12:45] <+Vivaciousx3> they were in the reaper
[1:12:47] <NorthGrizzly> Woolie did you see my email asking you not to read it until NUNS4. This is the scene what I am talking about.
[1:12:48] <+GreenCMD> they were stuck in the reaper
[1:12:50] <%MisterArcanine> The way Itachi broke out of reanimation was so slick
[1:12:52] <+Bluydee> Orochimaru releases control of them after this convo
[1:12:53] <%MyNameIsRasus> They were in the Reaper
[1:12:53] <%Jetzord> Tobirama "If they're an Uchiha, they're under my KIA" Senju
[1:12:54] <%Superbro64> because they were reaper death sealed, yes
[1:12:54] <C4m3r0n0409> They were in Reaper
[1:12:57] <LordGoodrick> @WoolieVersus Hasirama is the only one out of the 4 that breaks control, he could totally stomp Sasuke and Co.
[1:12:57] <Shishi1205> Reaper sealed
[1:12:58] <%MisterArcanine> Only good Uchiha
[1:12:59] <MarkUriah> Because the Reaper
[1:13:02] <%Dragstruction> Itachi pulled a scroll out if himself right?
[1:13:05] <jaygee303> HAshirama could easily break it but the rest can’t
[1:13:08] <Arblaster_> They got a dumb mask or something
[1:13:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> Their souls were protected
[1:13:09] <fist_wizard_jay> Watch yo chakra WATCH YO CHAKRA
[1:13:13] <Shishi1205> You need the mask of the reaper
[1:13:14] <%ggbhtg> Sadly, the game cut out Tobirama explaining the GENETIC DISPOSITION of the Uchiha
[1:13:14] <mMayrro> more like OWOchimaru amirite
[1:13:20] <phatmac16> Their souls are protected
[1:13:24] <+Grayhammatter> you need the mask of the reaper
[1:13:26] <phatmac16> You’re right
[1:13:28] <C4m3r0n0409> Yea
[1:13:28] <+Bluydee> the reaper's stomach
[1:13:30] <countgaculatv> Btw Orochimaru got his arms back
[1:13:30] <TheAceol> By using the UZUMAKI MASK
[1:13:31] <its_sinny> Ninja Paradise
[1:13:31] <%lotharrio> Lifestream?
[1:13:32] <MarkUriah> The souls were in the Reaper
[1:13:32] <%andrei11dr> Don't think about it
[1:13:34] <+Taglog7> HEAVEN OR HELL
[1:13:35] <%Dragstruction> blue oyster cult- Don't fear the reaper!
[1:13:40] <VidulaSaix> No their souls were all inside the Reaper. Remember they were ALL sealed inside the Reaper at one point @WoolieVersus
[1:13:40] <Jetsfantasy> The 3rd sealed all the souls in the reaper in early Naruto
[1:13:43] <%MisterArcanine> Tobimaru : you see the skull shape of an Uchiha....
[1:13:43] <NorthGrizzly> It cut out scene when the 2nd Hokage science explains his problem with the Uchiha.
[1:13:47] <InfiniteSwagbito> @WoolieVersus It's not quite explained but the mask was an Uzumaki artifact
[1:13:55] <Damie904> The Uchiha clan had a special mask that let the reaper possess you. Oro then cuts open the repear's belly to release the souls trapped in him.
[1:14:05] <+Thelvl1king> Talk about how the second super hates the odoyle’s I mean the uchiha!
[1:14:07] <Morning_Asakura> this sounds stupid
[1:14:12] <VidulaSaix> Sarutobi sealed 1st, 2nd and himself in the Reaper in base Naruto. Minato sealed himself in when he sealed Kurama inside Naruto
[1:14:13] <countgaculatv> @Damie904 You mean the Uzumaki mask
[1:14:15] <WaterKirby1964> !lurk
[1:14:15] <+Bluydee> they used white Zetsus for their bodies IIRC
[1:14:18] <LeBlanc233> not uchiha mask i thought is was uzumaki?
[1:14:21] <MonsterEnvy> This also got Orochimaru arms back
[1:14:22] <InfiniteSwagbito> It's Uzumaki
[1:14:23] <0pirus> who

[1:14:31] <+hawk_rush> he's too early of a hokage to be relevant LUL
[1:14:32] <+CoronetChris> They never brought back Jiraiya.
[1:14:33] <Arblaster_> Why did they even bring back the 2nd? LUL
[1:14:36] <%ggbhtg> Minh, talk about how much Tobirama SUPER hates the Uchiha
[1:14:37] <%andrei11dr> It's very unclear how gods and the afterlife actually work in Naruto
[1:14:42] <InfiniteSwagbito> @CoronetChris Jiraiya was unrecoverable
[1:14:43] <Deadbulky> Kappa
[1:14:45] <%masterpiecejeremy> Minato : "Anyone wants Scotty to beam em up?"
[1:14:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> "You see, the average Uchiha skull is smaller and has a wider brow than the average human"

[1:14:57] <Twin_Hallow> yeah I never know why did itachi kill woman and children
[1:14:58] <gamewarden92> "Why would I want to talk to Boruto's grandfather?"
[1:15:00] <phatmac16> You need to see this talk in the anime
[1:15:01] <TheAceol> @WoolieVersus Hiraishin was ALSO an invention of the Second
[1:15:02] <+Bluydee> Minato doesn't really say anything in anime/manga either tho
[1:15:06] <+MrRabbles> literally everything was the 2nd's tech
[1:15:08] <+hawk_rush> that really is how it is in the mange/anime lUL

[1:21:45] <+unclekulikov> I won't give up on my dream!
[1:21:48] <Twin_Hallow> but also why didnt the 4th or third change anything with the uchihas

[1:22:06] <+SilverInferno3> @BallerSwagBro9k Yes, but i"m afraid the game might skim over it
[1:22:08] <%arkv01> we'll seal the deal with a brojob
[1:22:10] <+TungstenViper> you can clearly hear Madara has a bad-guy voice
[1:22:16] <C4m3r0n0409> ALMOST HOKAGE
[1:22:17] <metabot64> This particular exposition was anime only right?
[1:22:17] <%jiggy_snipe> @BallerSwagBro9k no lie I think its a mental problem and racism
[1:22:23] <VidulaSaix> Hashirama was such a bro

[1:53:26] <Deadbulky> Minh racist against sneks
[1:53:27] <irfan_> reminder that manda was under sharingan control
[1:53:27] <%lotharrio> Frogs are family, Slugs are maybe a hivemind, Snakes are crimelords.

[1:54:15] <%Ashenik1> yep
[1:54:15] <%OUTheTeam> yep
[1:54:15] <%Kriss1827> yep
[1:54:15] <%ggbhtg> Kinda canon
[1:54:15] <%arkv01> no but gameplay
[1:54:15] <VidulaSaix> Kinda
[1:54:16] <ravenrooke> kinda
[1:54:16] <+Ether101_Prime> This is canon.
[1:54:16] <Klefth> BEYBLADE SNEK
[1:54:16] <+GreenCMD> a actuallyually yes
[1:54:17] <+WeepProphet> yes
[1:54:17] <InfiniteSwagbito> YES IT IS
[1:54:17] <+Aldesso> Yes
[1:54:17] <MonsterEnvy> Yes
[1:54:17] <its_sinny> maybe
[1:54:17] <+killogram123> yes
[1:54:17] <Fabric_tester> Eh
[1:54:18] <releasetherats> pretty much
[1:54:18] <0rond> kinda
[1:54:19] <Shishi1205> Kinda?
[1:54:19] <TheAceol> Basically
[1:54:19] <Morning_Asakura> actually yeah
[1:54:19] <@Solidus_113> no ultimates in kaiju mode
[1:54:19] <CrazyMedicine> Only 10 on screen
[1:54:20] <lordchachiman> sorta
[1:54:20] <Kira2993> YES
[1:54:20] <MarkUriah> Kinda
[1:54:20] <Personified134> KINDA
[1:54:20] <countgaculatv> Yes
[1:54:20] <+lethallunacyx> yea more or less
[1:54:21] <nepwar> yes but no
[1:54:21] <%Robot_Nixon_> kind of?
[1:54:22] <%ggbhtg> Mostly canon
[1:54:25] <Nekros4442> canon
[1:54:25] <+Vivaciousx3> they need fodder for the war
[1:54:25] <%ECRead> sure
[1:54:28] <hassanico2> Chat is there supposed to be music???
[1:54:29] <+croxeye> so like, i showed up during this bit, but it's ALREADY gone on too long
[1:54:30] <%MyNameIsRasus> Mostly canon
[1:54:31] <+CoronetChris> Just about
[1:54:31] <yabois3rg> Pretty much
[1:54:33] <Klefth> Kinda canon. Let's say CyberConnect took some liberties
[1:54:35] <+Dakuu75> yeah but, in the show they jsut get nuked in like 10 seconds
[1:54:35] <CrazyMedicine> The anime budget only could handle 10 of them
[1:54:37] <Ingwn> it was just alot
[1:54:44] <+MrRabbles> actual 30 minutes
[1:54:45] <0rond> the triple kaiju part was a lot smaller in the anime
[1:54:49] <%ggbhtg> @hassanico2 meh, not really
[1:54:53] <InfiniteSwagbito> YEP
[1:54:53] <%Ashenik1> I honestly felt insulted whe Woolie comapre THIS to LOTR LUL
[1:54:57] <+MrRabbles> this looks unsatisfying as gameplay
[1:54:59] <+TheDyingPride> I mean the snake probably didn't beyblade around on them
[1:54:59] <%nintega010> Beyblade Beyblade let it rip
[1:55:06] <%ggbhtg> tppowerBLBLBL tppowerBLBLBL tppowerBLBLBL tppowerBLBLBL
[1:55:07] <+kewlmyc> this looks boring as shit
[1:55:09] <SchlongKongEduardo> musuo
[1:55:14] <+lethallunacyx> Sakura does a big punch
[1:55:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's been 4 minutes and its already starting to drag woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:55:16] <Jetsfantasy> They did
[1:55:17] <+Bluydee> you can just kinda run through IIRC no need to murder them all
[1:55:19] <InfiniteSwagbito> @MrRabbles You're not wrong but woolie is also swinging at nothing most of the time
[1:55:20] <+kewlmyc> same 3 attacks over and over again
[1:55:22] <Deadbulky> That still only counts as one
[1:55:24] <zamzoph> Legolas and Gimli did it
[1:55:24] <0rond> i'm pretty sure in the anime it was pretty much "use the summons to get to the ten tails asap, not really "kill a bunch of the ads"
[1:55:25] <CrazyMedicine> This is literally dynasty warriors
[1:55:25] <NotHereToStream> double tap them
[1:55:27] <+croxeye> and for the frog to use the same 3 hit combo over and over and over and over
[1:55:30] <%lotharrio> I do't care how big it was, it only counts as one!

[1:56:50] <biomegabear> thats a cool detail
[1:56:51] <%the_vedo_show> that's cool
[1:56:52] <%nintega010> what you didn't know
[1:56:54] <Personified134> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BUT ITS SICK
[1:56:56] <Klefth> Gamabunta was Jiraiya's
[1:56:59] <TheAceol> Gamakichi was Naruto's true best friend
[1:57:01] <MarkUriah> you already lost
[1:57:04] <%jiggy_snipe> is the Slug a different slug too?
[1:57:09] <invader_rin> You need to cut off it's arms too
[1:57:10] <Twin_Hallow> Sakaura didnt get a like learning to summon ep did she like a filler
[1:57:10] <%GrassCannon> So Sakura's the only one still using her mentor's summon?
[1:57:12] <+Bluydee> every slug is Katsuyu
[1:57:12] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus just walk over the small fry
[1:57:14] <%hepheros> woolieF woolieT
[1:57:14] <YakumoYomi> Bunta is darker and has a scar over his eye
[1:57:15] <InfiniteSwagbito> kind of
[1:57:16] <TheAceol> Nah
[1:57:16] <MarkUriah> yea
[1:57:17] <its_sinny> no
[1:57:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> Not really
[1:57:17] <%jiggy_snipe> oh ok
[1:57:18] <%lotharrio> He just kept showing up being bigger.
[1:57:19] <%ggbhtg> Orochimaru comments on it
[1:57:20] <%heroversusofficial> @WoolieVersus Just walk on them
[1:57:20] <saiyan24675> @jiggy_snipe no it’s the same slug from Tsubasa
[1:57:22] <+oscar_m510> @jiggy_snipe no still Lady Katsuya
[1:57:23] <+SilverInferno3> Nah Gamabunta just retired
[1:57:25] <%ggbhtg> Orochimaru comments on it. @WoolieVersus
[1:57:26] <+CoronetChris> Nope
[1:57:28] <saiyan24675> Tsunade
[1:57:30] <0rond> gamakichi slowly got bigger throughout the series
[1:57:33] <+Bluydee> every single slug that appears is just Katsuyu splitting up
[1:57:33] <+masker101> nah he just shows up
[1:57:35] <+lethallunacyx> He said Bunta was busy
[1:57:35] <Klefth> Gamakichi does get progressively bigger in the anime and manga, but he does get REAL BIG in this part
[1:57:38] <MonsterEnvy> He slowly got bigger
[1:57:38] <Damie904> Nope, he just aged Woolie. Nothing special about it.
[1:57:53] <irfan_> we see gamabunta get bigger since the start of shippuden, and especially in pain arc
[1:57:53] <InfiniteSwagbito> woolie you don't have to do the 10k
[1:57:55] <VidulaSaix> Just step on them Woolie
[1:57:59] <+fugatlas> this IS the passing of the torch moment. In the anime naruto thinks he's summoning Bunta but is surprised to see a full sized Kichi appear instead
[1:58:02] <MarkUriah> yea
[1:58:06] <+SilverInferno3> Well Gamabunta helped with the Pain fight
[1:58:06] <InfiniteSwagbito> after Pain
[1:58:10] <+masker101> too busy to save the world LUL
[1:58:12] <Morning_Asakura> after pain
[1:58:16] <InfiniteSwagbito> after getting his ass kicked in the Naruto vs Pain fight he retired
[1:58:19] <@Solidus_113> Woolie wants big number
[1:58:23] <+Bluydee> woolie wants the 10k
[1:58:24] <jbees7> gamakichi says something of the affect of we frogs don't grow as slow as you humans
[1:58:25] <VidulaSaix> Naruto has to Minh Max before he can save the world
[1:58:26] <%lotharrio> Naruto and 'Kichi are closer in terms of friendship.
[1:58:27] <%ECRead> Gamabunta dead as fuck ain't he?

[2:36:25] <%Irridium> clean
[2:36:26] <+kaiju7544> They are in Obito’s kamui space
[2:36:27] <Jetsfantasy> It's a unique dimension
[2:36:29] <mortalmanbaby> over hyped

[2:36:38] <mMayrro> minimal magic is PogChamp
[2:36:40] <biomegabear> cool fight
[2:36:44] <C4m3r0n0409> SUPER OVER HYPED
[2:36:46] <Zayasu> the best naruto fight is in boruto LUL
[2:36:46] <karl_rex> Why does nobody with the Rinnegan use any of its abilities after Pain
[2:36:49] <PhilusMatias> that was surprisingly nice to watch. very little over the top nonsense
[2:36:50] <+SleepingPliskin> well he purposely got his heart piereced to be released from Madara's control
[2:36:51] <niddron> back to basics
[2:36:54] <VidulaSaix> BUT METEORS ARE PEAK NINJA
[2:36:54] <Darren716> No stands
[2:36:55] <+oscar_m510> no Kaiju battles
[2:36:55] <VidulaSaix> Kappa
[2:36:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> okay what does he think, I missed cause I was watching the fight
[2:36:56] <%Kazuhira_Boat> yo we need tobiramas uchiha skull shape rant
[2:36:57] <Arek_1> There was a missing line from the manga where Obito says something like "Look, I have no heart."
[2:36:58] <+Grayhammatter> not a single susan
[2:36:59] <+HawkGoggles2> No comet metaria for them.
[2:36:59] <mortalmanbaby> over the top is wat makes stuff cool
[2:37:02] <%GrassCannon> The series was in dire need of more ninja shit
[2:37:07] <invader_rin> Just a normal 1 on 1 fight
[2:37:08] <C4m3r0n0409> Cool lol thats it
[2:37:08] <biomegabear> simple 1 on 1
[2:37:09] <ComfyFox> no K**ens
[2:37:12] <%ggbhtg> it may not be the GOAT FIGHT OF EVERYTHING, but it was still worth seeing
[2:37:13] <Hellarussian> Kayokenx10 god super sayian 5 ultra instinct blue god kamehameha
[2:37:14] <venomfury86> the best fight is the final
[2:37:18] <YakumoYomi> Naruto's at its best, I feel, when they drop the world-ending explosions and DBZ beams for intimate CQC
[2:37:21] <C4m3r0n0409> Kamui dimension
[2:37:25] <InfiniteSwagbito> @karl_rex It's explained early on that the Pain fight kind of revealed the weaknesses in those abilities and Naruto already knows all the hard counters
[2:37:30] <saiyan24675> No magic eyeballs
[2:37:38] <bunnyscruff> The final semi normal fight
[2:37:40] <+VGGary> the special eyes
[2:37:41] <C4m3r0n0409> They both are in the eyes
[2:37:41] <+oscar_m510> woolieWUT woolieWUT woolieWUT

[2:37:52] <Klefth> It's a pocket dimension
[2:37:52] <%lotharrio> It looks like a blackhole.
[2:37:57] <VidulaSaix> Just says its Kamui dimension Minh
[2:37:58] <twitchyal> @WoolieVersus Naruto again? Woolie I am so dissapointed, that's it I am unsubscribing from Super Bunny Hop.
[2:37:58] <C4m3r0n0409> Pocket dimension
[2:38:00] <VidulaSaix> Thats all you need to say
[2:38:02] <karl_rex> @InfiniteSwagbito Yeah but Madara doesn't know that
[2:38:04] <Kira2993> it's a pocket dimension
[2:38:06] <ComfyFox> ZA HANDO
[2:38:11] <saiyan24675> @proudlydrowsy it was on top of that pillar in the background
[2:38:13] <Arek_1> Right eye is close-range phase. Left eye is long-range phase.
[2:38:15] <AllRabbitProductio> Its a blackwhole pocket dimention
[2:38:15] <+kewlmyc> pocket dimension
[2:38:15] <C4m3r0n0409> POCKET DIMENSION KAMUI
[2:38:18] <%rubbishbinge> Kakashi has the long range Kamui and Obito has the close range one
[2:38:18] <Hellarussian> eyehole dimension
[2:38:19] <%ggbhtg> intergalactic, planetary, another dimension
[2:38:20] <MTLxSpider> SO LIKE
[2:38:22] <MarkUriah> obito sent them there
[2:38:23] <MTLxSpider> AN ISEKAI
[2:38:27] <@Solidus_113> no
[2:38:30] <Sol_Install> no
[2:38:31] <InfiniteSwagbito> @karl_rex He doesn't know or care, because he's got even stronger moves instead of the weak bitch shit Pain had
[2:38:31] <@Solidus_113> go away spider
[2:38:32] <%lotharrio> It's also how Obito/Tobi was dodging hits on his own body from blind spots. He'd send part of himself into that dimension.
[2:38:35] <MTLxSpider> LOL
[2:38:35] <+oscar_m510> So pocket universes let me tell you about them
[2:38:37] <bunnyscruff> I honestly can't remember when Kakashi gained that power or why it took him so long to learn it
[2:38:38] <%bread_assassin> Why does this different dimension have breathable air?
[2:38:38] <saiyan24675> No not like an Isekai
[2:38:39] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:38:42] <frostech8> Like night crawler
[2:38:47] <%generalve> obitos gimmick is his dimension

[2:38:55] <MarkUriah> no
[2:38:56] <C4m3r0n0409> NOOO
[2:38:56] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> @WoolieVersus EVERY Mangekyo has a special thing only a pair can do

[2:38:58] <+SilverInferno3> Nope
[2:38:58] <AllRabbitProductio> No
[2:38:58] <%optimasmaximas> no
[2:38:59] <MonsterEnvy> No
[2:39:00] <0pirus> the pocket dimension has a breathable atmosphere
[2:39:00] <karl_rex> @InfiniteSwagbito Redacted doesn't know that either
[2:39:00] <Fabric_tester> No
[2:39:01] <+NiSoKr> That isn't a location
[2:39:01] <Hellarussian> thatsin their head
[2:39:02] <NorthGrizzly> NO
[2:39:03] <Klefth> Yup. Yup, yup, yup. It's totally Nightcrawler
[2:39:04] <%optimasmaximas> genjustsu
[2:39:04] <+thesyndrome> no thas just a genjutsu illusion
[2:39:05] <AllRabbitProductio> Thats an illusion
[2:39:08] <%MyNameIsRasus> Nah, that's not a physical location
[2:39:08] <jbees7> is obito an isekai?
[2:39:09] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Right eye is close-range phase. Left eye is long-range phase.
[2:39:10] <skewerstar> The stuff goes into the next dimension those old DBZ dubs keep sending people to!
[2:39:12] <C4m3r0n0409> Thats a real dimension
[2:39:16] <%Robot_Nixon_> special eyes
[2:39:16] <bunnyscruff> I'm guessing Kakashi didn't have the power for so long because the writer didn't think of it yet
[2:39:16] <%ggbhtg> intergalactic, planetary, another dimension.
[2:39:17] <Iwashi94> NINJAS
[2:39:17] <%lotharrio> Mangekyo is an illusion, it happens in your head. Kamui is another dimension.
[2:39:17] <+oscar_m510> that's Itachi's sex dungeon
[2:39:18] <zamzoph> ninjas btw
[2:39:21] <+Grayhammatter> NINJAS
[2:39:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> Isekai'ed LUL
[2:39:23] <twitchyal> @WoolieVersus So they enter the Shadow Realm to play the Eye of Judgement.
[2:39:23] <SquigglyLizard> ninjas
[2:39:25] <Aracon_> NINJA NINJA
[2:39:26] <+captain_history> Kamui is kind of crazy yeah
[2:39:27] <+GreenCMD> yeah Obito is Gigahax
[2:39:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> SHINOBI
[2:39:31] <LazyLudens> ninjas btw
[2:39:31] <+TheDyingPride> """"Ninjas""""
[2:39:32] <Hellarussian> remember kunais?
[2:39:33] <%SuperKirby24> THEM NINJAS
[2:39:33] <Josef_Stryker> NINJAS
[2:39:34] <Lysdexic9541> NINJAS
[2:39:40] <C4m3r0n0409> Obito transports them both
[2:39:42] <+CoronetChris> NINJAS
[2:39:44] <Hellarussian> remember chakra?
[2:39:44] <+oscar_m510> all a bunch of ninjas
[2:39:45] <yajirobe_sama> Kamui is broken
[2:39:45] <MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Obito's power is is to send parts of his body to Kamui which gives him Intangabilty
[2:39:47] <abusywizard> All based on true events
[2:39:48] <NorthGrizzly> All of ninja that absorb into dimension probably starved to death
[2:39:51] <venomfury86> Itachi used the Tsukuyomi on Kakashi
[2:40:00] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Kakashi sent things there, Obite sent himslef there
[2:40:01] <+Aldesso> Why is the guy who cant speak english explaining things
[2:40:02] <%lotharrio> It's an incredibly strong long-range attack/support power.
[2:40:06] <%andrei11dr> If you think that's OP just wait for the next chapter
[2:40:07] <Arek_1> @lotharrio Tsukuyomi specifically*, not Mangekyo. But you're right.
[2:40:13] <Kira2993> just watch a clip from the anime
[2:40:14] <%nintega010> That's why no one in Naruto is close to Sasuke or Naruto there broken.
[2:40:17] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:40:22] <%Robot_Nixon_> its ok mihn LUL
[2:40:22] <0pirus> I see
[2:40:23] <%gatorafan> @aldesso because he's the only one who saw the thing
[2:40:25] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> You can do it Min!
[2:40:25] <Reizie_Etherealm> English 3rd language problems
[2:40:26] <yajirobe_sama> Imagine if obito had susanoo
[2:40:27] <%MyNameIsRasus> He sent Naruto in there to Rasengan Obito's mask
[2:40:27] <Twin_Hallow> thats how I figured it out bakc in the day
[2:40:27] <Zohare> It hit Obito because Obito was in the other dimension
[2:40:30] <redrins> same sharingan
[2:40:31] <+Grayhammatter> it's fine minh
[2:40:31] <turbofolk> Other DIMENSIONS!!!!!
[2:40:31] <+thesyndrome> because it's OBITOS EYE
[2:40:33] <MonsterEnvy> No because the spaces are connected
[2:40:35] <Klefth> Because he figured out they were both linked to the same dimension
[2:40:35] <mephium> same eye set
[2:40:36] <+VGGary> they have the same eye so their abilities are linked
[2:40:36] <Aracon_> there ya go
[2:40:36] <+oscar_m510> yeah this shit is really complicated
[2:40:37] <YakumoYomi> Kakashi has Obito's other eye
[2:40:37] <%lotharrio> He suspected it.
[2:40:39] <0pirus> same stand
[2:40:39] <VidulaSaix> He knew that the only person capable of accessign that dimension is ebcause its the other Sharingan of the pair @WoolieVersus
[2:40:40] <+captain_history> Kamui is only an Obito thing yeah
[2:40:41] <+kyh9> Each Sharingan has its own dimension
[2:40:41] <skewerstar> So like, Deidara's arm is somewhere in there?
[2:40:43] <MarkUriah> same eyes
[2:40:45] <%heroversusofficial> Same stand
[2:40:45] <Twin_Hallow> obito has the exact opposite power of kakashi kinda
[2:40:47] <invader_rin> The eyes were linked
[2:40:47] <InfiniteSwagbito> YES
[2:40:49] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Same Stando Woolie
[2:40:49] <Jetsfantasy> Same eyes, same portal
[2:40:52] <Twin_Hallow> thats how I knew tobi was obito
[2:40:52] <biomegabear> @venomfury86 so tsukuyomi is still viable in shippuden?
[2:40:56] <C4m3r0n0409> YES NICE WOOLIE
[2:40:56] <Lildmarsh24> I can’t wait to read “I met my dead friend on the battlefield and he sent me to another world because he’s a virgin?!?!”
[2:40:56] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> WAIT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
[2:40:57] <Hellarussian> semantics
[2:40:59] <%Zerotoad5> He did it
[2:41:02] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Right eye is close-range phase. Left eye is long-range phase.
[2:41:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> Woolie got it
[2:41:07] <%optimasmaximas> @captain_history no kakashi can do it
[2:41:07] <InfiniteSwagbito> Yes
[2:41:08] <%heroversusofficial> Woolie piecing it together
[2:41:11] <+CarlosEoM> Woolie figured it out
[2:41:13] <InfiniteSwagbito> Kakashi has the long range
[2:41:15] <%arkv01> wifi warriors vs ethernet
[2:41:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> FIGURED IT OUT
[2:41:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @C4m3r0n0409
[2:41:17] <bunnyscruff> Plug and play eyes to different dimensions
[2:41:17] <Jetsfantasy> I like that explanation
[2:41:18] <InfiniteSwagbito> Obito has the close range
[2:41:21] <Aracon_> LUL
[2:41:22] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:41:25] <+captain_history> @optimasmaximas because it's Obito's eye
[2:41:29] <C4m3r0n0409> One is himself
[2:41:29] <%ChoculaUltra> Obito a scrub through and through.
[2:41:29] <Aracon_> get punked by your own eye
[2:41:30] <%lotharrio> Thanks for the present bro!
[2:41:30] <InfiniteSwagbito> If obito had both eyes he'd be legit unkillable
[2:41:31] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:41:32] <Hellarussian> naw its mine now
[2:41:35] <%BisoromiBear> shooting his friend with a gifted gun

[2:41:36] <C4m3r0n0409> The other is other eye
[2:41:38] <Shishi1205> He has a rinnengan now
[2:41:38] <%arkv01> but I want urs too
[2:41:39] <+kyh9> "I want yours too"
[2:41:40] <Reizie_Etherealm> You were able to fuck me up because of ME, I LET YOU WIN
[2:41:40] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Tobirama was the RIGHTEST
[2:41:41] <+CarlosEoM> well i want yours too
[2:41:42] <+oscar_m510> nah I'm Megaman bitch
[2:41:42] <+Bluydee> fits with every Mangekyō having 2 abilities
[2:41:46] <@Solidus_113> back to video game
[2:41:47] <%optimasmaximas> @captain_history then yes, thouhght you meant otherwise, my bad
[2:41:48] <MonsterEnvy> As well he warped a rasengan into the pocket dimension so when Obito went into so he could dodge he got hit
[2:41:51] <%lotharrio> Half an Uchiha power-set made Kakashi a living legend in Konoha.
[2:41:52] <+tuchpi> he's a regifter
[2:41:53] <biomegabear> @InfiniteSwagbito yeah I cen see that with a susan and all
[2:41:55] <Hellarussian> videogames
[2:41:57] <%arkv01> vidorgammu
[2:41:59] <Twin_Hallow> which is why shariguns are hella op
[2:42:00] <%jiggy_snipe> Yea Obito could be busted if he had both his eyes
[2:42:04] <%SuperKirby24> videogamenojutsu
[2:42:05] <+captain_history> yeha both eyes Kamui would be absurd
[2:42:06] <+Grayhammatter> videoGAME

[2:42:16] <Castawayplague> Back to life
[2:42:21] <InfiniteSwagbito> Both eyes kamui would be fucking busted and Obito had to be nerfed
[2:42:24] <Castawayplague> Back to reality
[2:42:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> Eternal Mangekyo Shenanigan
[2:42:32] <phatmac16> He was done with the video stuff

[2:42:39] <Castawayplague> Back to the here and now again
[2:42:40] <%lotharrio> Guess he didn't have experience with the Rinnegan techniques so he didn't bother with them?

[2:43:53] <NiktenKing> The only people that make kunai look scary are Shikamaru and Minato

[2:45:19] <%ggbhtg> yes actually
[2:45:19] <VidulaSaix> He super was
[2:45:19] <AllRabbitProductio> he was
[2:45:19] <d_man303> it's a royal guard shield how do you not like it?
[2:45:19] <MonsterEnvy> He was
[2:45:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> Was as a teen
[2:45:20] <+ineek10> he was his student
[2:45:21] <NiktenKing> Yes, he was their student
[2:45:21] <niddron> he was a kid
[2:45:23] <%lotharrio> Sarutobi was a student of the Second Hokage, I beleive.
[2:45:24] <MonsterEnvy> He was student of them
[2:45:24] <invader_rin> He was their student
[2:45:24] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> He was a kid
[2:45:25] <Jetsfantasy> He was. He's like 80 something
[2:45:25] <Klefth> He was around. Sarutobi is old as shit
[2:45:25] <Twin_Hallow> tobiramam was his sensei
[2:45:27] <DrStinkers> the 1st wasn't that long ago
[2:45:28] <+SilverInferno3> Yes
[2:45:29] <jaygee303> He was
[2:45:30] <MarkUriah> yes
[2:45:31] <C4m3r0n0409> YES
[2:45:32] <NiktenKing> Yes
[2:45:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[2:45:34] <phatmac16> yup
[2:45:34] <+CoronetChris> Yeah he was a babu
[2:45:35] <InfiniteSwagbito> around there
[2:45:35] <niddron> yeah
[2:45:37] <BallerSwagBro9k> 2nd Hokage didnt last long
[2:45:38] <+Vivaciousx3> its basically 4 generations at this point right?
[2:45:42] <+SilverInferno3> Him and Danzo
[2:45:42] <%jiggy_snipe> around the era
[2:45:43] <Ultzerostar00> Do the Hokages have a super together?
[2:45:43] <%MadGioNo> Sarutobi was the 1st and 2nd Hokage's apprentice
[2:45:44] <Shishi1205> Basically
[2:45:44] <%Kazuhira_Boat> 3rd is 1st and 2nds student
[2:45:45] <C4m3r0n0409> Leaf is not super Old
[2:45:46] <+CarlosEoM> kinda
[2:45:47] <Sedrelic> he whole timeline is like 100 years
[2:45:49] <jaygee303> Only 2 to 3 or two generations
[2:45:50] <its_sinny> maybe
[2:45:51] <MonsterEnvy> He was an apprentice
[2:45:53] <VidulaSaix> All the Hokage died young outside of Sarutobi
[2:45:54] <AllRabbitProductio> Not since the beginning
[2:45:54] <InfiniteSwagbito> the timeline is somewhat vague
[2:45:54] <Shishi1205> 2nd hokage was Sarutobis teacher
[2:45:59] <mortalmanbaby> time lione is fucked in this
[2:46:00] <jaygee303> They’re not ancient
[2:46:01] <C4m3r0n0409> Leaf is like 100 years old
[2:46:04] <skewerstar> Sarutobi's Prime is evidently when he's an old geezer...
[2:46:04] <+chikitsune9> yes
[2:46:05] <Kira2993> Hashirama died young so connect the dots Kappa
[2:46:05] <MarkUriah> Leaf is relativly new
[2:46:06] <Damie904> Sarutboi was the 3rd, so he had to be alive long enough to know the 2nd.
[2:46:08] <+SilverInferno3> @Ultzerostar00 These three, I think so?
[2:46:09] <hamahiroyuki> 1st and 2nd are brothers with close age
[2:46:13] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> The village isn't older that 100 years
[2:46:13] <clonexsniperx> i think around 60-80
[2:46:15] <niddron> hidden leaf constructed after ww2
[2:46:15] <+oscar_m510> yeah the timeline is very vague
[2:46:15] <jbees7> 1st might be younger than he looks
[2:46:19] <karl_rex> Stuff gets super weird it treats stuff like Hashirama being a long time ago but its was like 80 years
[2:46:19] <%lotharrio> Sarutobi had the longest run as a Hokage. But the village system is a new thing overall.
[2:46:22] <venomfury86> Danzo and Sarutobi were Tobirama's students
[2:46:22] <%andrei11dr> It's kinda crazy how the known world of Naruto is max 200 years old
[2:46:30] <Deadbulky> Switch characters remember and use specias woolz ;p
[2:46:34] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:46:36] <InfiniteSwagbito> "that's a lot of balls" -Reggie 2020
[2:46:38] <Ultzerostar00> @silverinferno3 Is it DLC? I forget which ones are and aren't DLC
[2:46:41] <%gatorafan> and he never dropped them
[2:46:46] <%ggbhtg> It's not a spoiler why he looks like that, btw
[2:46:46] <+captain_history> the OP balls yeah
[2:46:46] <biomegabear> the eternity 8 is the sage thing
[2:46:51] <@Solidus_113> I think these 3 have a team super, be sure to fill your Storm gauge with assists
[2:46:53] <YakumoYomi> Clip that, and use it with no context
[2:46:53] <+Bluydee> the only plothole that bothers me is that Hashirama's so strong it doesn't really make sense that Hashirama died young and Tobirama had to become Hokage during war
[2:46:59] <C4m3r0n0409> USE TEAM SUPER WOOLIE
[2:47:00] <%ggbhtg> it would've been explained why he looks like that by now
[2:47:06] <therealtacopancakes> Hiruzen was born the son of Sasuke Sarutobi. The Sarutobi clan was one of the first clans to settle in the newly-created Konohagakure, where Hiruzen struck up a friendship with the Shimura clan's Danzō Shimura. Hiruzen was part of the first generation of ninja produced by Konoha and he, Homura Mitokado, and Koharu Utatane were placed under the tutelage of Tobirama Senju.
[2:47:07] <+oscar_m510> all I know is that Sarutobi was with the Second Hokage during the 2and Ninja war
[2:47:07] <+SilverInferno3> @Ultzerostar00 The six hokage have one as DLC, but the first three are in the base game IIRC
[2:47:07] <MonsterEnvy> The Sage was the 10 Tails possessor
[2:47:10] <Morning_Asakura> oh yeah there are team supers
[2:47:11] <InfiniteSwagbito> team super is fucking rad
[2:47:13] <%optimasmaximas> just found out gearbox nerfed my action skill
[2:47:13] <C4m3r0n0409> TEAM SUPER

[2:47:43] <C4m3r0n0409> ASISTS DUDE
[2:47:48] <%MadGioNo> Woolie use jutsu's to meaty opponents on wakeup if you don't use them during the fight lol
[2:47:48] <+oscar_m510> oh yeah Sasuke Sarutobi which is why Sasuke was named that
[2:47:50] <Reizie_Etherealm> Spam assists

[2:47:53] <Fabric_tester> Assist

[2:47:57] <jaygee303> @monsterenvy He was OP without it though. Enough to beat it without help and split it
[2:48:01] <Morning_Asakura> chat chill
[2:48:01] <MarkUriah> he is actually crazzy
[2:48:03] <%ggbhtg> They probably mean, don't kill him before the team super can build
[2:48:09] <InfiniteSwagbito> Obito's awakening is nuts but it's not shown in this fight
[2:48:11] <C4m3r0n0409> He doesnt even know how
[2:48:18] <%lotharrio> "Gimme the Matrix with my waifu already!"
[2:48:18] <%Superbro64> doesn't getting hit with a sage of six paths black licorice ball turn off your chakra or something? can someone confirm?
[2:48:22] <venomfury86> Obito wants to live in the Matrix
[2:48:23] <releasetherats> he can look at the team supers when he beats the game like there are tons
[2:48:28] <VidulaSaix> Chat is basically saying spam out asisst trill that bar fills up then use team super

[2:49:03] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus you can do them after you beat the game
[2:49:03] <+redyoshi5> you have to use assists to build the bar first
[2:49:04] <Fabric_tester> Assist gauge
[2:49:05] <karl_rex> Yeah it disrupts your chakra but it can also prevent an edo tensei's body from regenerating
[2:49:06] <fairore> it's fine

[2:57:33] <InfiniteSwagbito> @WoolieVersus It's not explained here but Sage Mode is the only ting that can hurt the Ten Tails Jinchuriki
[2:57:38] <+Aldesso> They completly glossed over that only Sage Attacks work on him now

[2:58:17] <biomegabear> uhoh
[2:58:18] <karl_rex> Supposedly only those with Sage Mode can damage Obito right now so thats why Naruto had it active
[2:58:28] <%jiggy_snipe> Link's Awakening PogChamp
[2:58:28] <0rond> ain't not bondin like uzumaki bonding, cuz uzumaki bonding ain't over until you kill the god king of man kind

[2:58:35] <%MadGioNo> The Yellow bar under your chakra
[2:58:42] <VidulaSaix> That was the one you needed to read. When that bar is full, then you can do team super
[2:58:45] <%andrei11dr> UM....don't look at the picture
[2:58:47] <Shishi1205> Its blue that goes into yellow

[2:59:21] <ComfyFox> That Guide Tip had some Spoiler Picture lol
[2:59:24] <RayCSmooth> just spam assists till it glows
[2:59:24] <mortalmanbaby> the game will tell u
[2:59:27] <VidulaSaix> Some have generic team assist, and some teams have special ones
[2:59:30] <@Solidus_113> Do assists, and once you get to half meter you unlock the secondary actions like charge and block assist
[2:59:33] <redrins> but, fighting regularly involves using assists
[2:59:35] <GrumpMic> get all S ranks!!!!!!!!!
[2:59:38] <@Solidus_113> they all build meter
[2:59:42] <%ggbhtg> doing all Tag mechanics build meter
[2:59:43] <mortalmanbaby> the game will tell you
[2:59:47] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Storm 4 glossed over explaining the Truth-Seeking Balls. They're made from all 5 elements. When Yin-Yang Release is applied to them, they negate all ninjutsu. Their weakness is natural energy (Sage Jutsu).
[2:59:52] <VidulaSaix> Cause Minato was Awakened so he didnt have an ultimate
[2:59:54] <Shishi1205> Minato was awakened=no ultiamte

[3:05:02] <Sedrelic> ye
[3:05:02] <+SilverInferno3> Orochimaru no, but Kabuto yes
[3:05:03] <%rubbishbinge> yeye
[3:05:03] <Deadbulky> kABUTO YES
[3:05:03] <Kira2993> Kabuto yes
[3:05:03] <NorthGrizzly> YES
[3:05:04] <C4m3r0n0409> Kabuto yes
[3:05:05] <InfiniteSwagbito> Orochimaru is just like that
[3:05:05] <VidulaSaix> Yes Woolie, Kabuto explained last game that he had Dragon Sage
[3:05:06] <biomegabear> yes
[3:05:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[3:05:06] <%Kazuhira_Boat> YES
[3:05:06] <RetroCop87> Kabuto is a Dragon Sage
[3:05:07] <Arek_1> Yes, old news.
[3:05:08] <phatmac16> yes
[3:05:08] <tusk_act4> Kabuto yes
[3:05:08] <niddron> yes
[3:05:09] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus yes it snake sage/dragon sage
[3:05:09] <%Sparkseid> right
[3:05:10] <YakumoYomi> Kabuto, yes. Orochimaru, no.
[3:05:11] <DrStinkers> orochimaru had sage techniques
[3:05:11] <%ECRead> Kabuto, not Orochimaru
[3:05:11] <+GreenCMD> OROCHIMARU did too
[3:05:11] <+knowyourenemy_97> Yes. Minh is wrong.
[3:05:12] <%lotharrio> YES. Orochimaru is using a hacked Sage mode.
[3:05:12] <Twin_Hallow> Kabuto took them Hashirama cells
[3:05:12] <%MadGioNo> Different Sage modes based on the animals they use
[3:05:16] <%ggbhtg> We missed outon it, but that's technically Tsunade using Sage Mode @WoolieVersus
[3:05:18] <Zohare> Orochimaru just likes to look good
[3:05:20] <Twin_Hallow> they love them some hashirama dna
[3:05:21] <Sol_Install> not orichi but kabuto yes
[3:05:21] <%rubbishbinge> Kabuto was a sage, Orochimaru was rejected by the white snake sage
[3:05:21] <rosemon5001> orochimaru is 100% sage it up
[3:05:22] <niddron> snek sage
[3:05:23] <Goraka91> Oro is just fabulous
[3:05:25] <+chikitsune9> not orochimaru
[3:05:30] <NiktenKing> Orochimaru was a bitch ass snake sage. Kabuto became a true DRAGON sage
[3:05:30] <bunnyscruff> What kind of animal friend does Hashirama have?
[3:05:30] <StarlitStunner> Snake and Dragon sages
[3:05:33] <jaygee303> Orochi tried but can’t kabuto yeah
[3:05:33] <+GreenCMD> OROCHIMARU is an imperfect sage
[3:05:35] <phatmac16> Oro uses a hacked sage mode
[3:05:35] <nepwar> oro just wanted it for asthetics
[3:05:38] <DrStinkers> curse seal was a sage jutsu i think
[3:05:42] <VidulaSaix> Jiraiya was also a garbage Sage. He could only used it with the mama and papa frog fused to him
[3:05:45] <VidulaSaix> His was incomplete
[3:05:45] <+kyh9> Orochimaru just wanted to look like a snake
[3:05:48] <+MrRabbles> oro is just a diva
[3:05:50] <Sol_Install> he was incomplete
[3:05:53] <+Nobrev> @bunnyscruff a tree. hes a wood sage
[3:05:53] <%lotharrio> Orochimaru hacked a sage mode (curse seal) by studying Jugo.
[3:05:55] <MonsterEnvy> Orochimaru like Jiriya were imperfect
[3:06:02] <+knowyourenemy_97> lookup the source material, Orochimaru was a sage!
[3:06:03] <%rubbishbinge> Curse Seal is artificial sage mode because he couldn't become a real sage
[3:06:05] <Shishi1205> They had to beat naruto
[3:06:10] <%MadGioNo> Naruto is a Fox sage
[3:06:10] <VidulaSaix> Sages arent all animals
[3:06:16] <+Grayhammatter> wood sage is senju
[3:06:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> Naruto is not a Fox Sage
[3:06:20] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Explaining Sage Mode is another big newsletter thing btw

[3:12:49] <%mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer500 Hey Woolz, about spoiling things, I care way more about characters than I do world building, so to me it seemed natural any information about AOTs world's secrets/reveals weren't really spoilers, cause all that really matters is the reaction to it and who discovers it when, I thought it'd be as much of a spoiler as saying "Casca grows her hair out at one point", that's when I learned people care a lot about lore/basements.

[3:22:48] <%Theycallmenerf> Susano?
[3:22:48] <Damie904> The curse seal is based on Jugo's clan. Jugo's clan's kekkai genkai is sage mode transformation.
[3:22:49] <+albanio> its nature energy so its p much sage mode
[3:22:50] <%Robot_Nixon_> Explaining naruto lore makes anyone look crazy
[3:22:51] <+thesyndrome> wow minh really is bad at explaining things
[3:22:51] <Sol_Install> Curse mark is hack sage mode
[3:22:52] <cheaddos> curse seal is from orochimaru. orochimaru is a sageç
[3:22:52] <%rubbishbinge> @WoolieVersus Orochimaru failed to become a sage, so he invented the curse seal.
[3:22:53] <Zohare> MAGIC
[3:22:53] <0pirus> what
[3:22:54] <+oscar_m510> maybe he means the Cursed Mark's power are similar to Sage mode
[3:22:55] <+Vivaciousx3> its jank sage mode
[3:22:56] <%lotharrio> @WoolieVersus Jugo's family are mutants. They naturally absorb natural energy. Orochimaru studied him and developed the Curse Seals. Orochimaru hacked a Sage Mode.
[3:22:57] <d3molitionxp3rt> HE SAID “what is a simp” lmao
[3:22:58] <Morning_Asakura> huh
[3:22:58] <Twin_Hallow> werent ppl using Hashirama dna also
[3:22:58] <NiktenKing> Curse mode is from Jugos cells
[3:22:58] <Fabric_tester> Magic
[3:22:58] <MonsterEnvy> Curse mark is a budget sage mode
[3:23:01] <evil_doru> how do u remember this shit
[3:23:02] <%optimasmaximas> minh saying fuck it you shouklda watched what i sent
[3:23:03] <nepwar> its hacked magic. fuck you
[3:23:05] <+SilverInferno3> Sage mode is just nature energy usage, to be clear
[3:23:05] <karl_rex> Jugo's people have inate sage energy that Orochimaru used to base the cursed seals on
[3:23:07] <Hellarussian> their carrot cake is a curse seal
[3:23:10] <%jiggy_snipe> sure
[3:23:10] <phatmac16> hacked sage mode
[3:23:11] <Mr_Rakjo> Curse Seal is Jank Low Tier Sage
[3:23:13] <bunnyscruff> Seriously what allows sage mode, I've seen two animal ones and a goddamn tree one
[3:23:14] <+Jerimoi> minhs def done explaining naruto
[3:23:15] <jaygee303> @theycallmenerf the plot is only what the characters need to do to have more annoying Versions of themselves in boruto
[3:23:16] <0pirus> do your homework
[3:23:17] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Cursed Seal is if you fail to use the Snake Sage Mode properly
[3:23:26] <MarkUriah> The Curse Seal uses natural energy which Sage Mode uses
[3:23:27] <C4m3r0n0409> HE ABSORBED IT DUDE
[3:23:31] <%MyNameIsRasus> That's why Obito looks that way now
[3:23:31] <VidulaSaix> Pretty much
[3:23:33] <InfiniteSwagbito> @bunnyscruff Sage mode is just using a technique to absorb nature energy
[3:23:34] <+demonhunter790> Orochimaru cheats , no big surprise
[3:23:36] <Shishi1205> He became the jincurichi
[3:23:40] <redrins> obito became the jinchuriki of the ten tails
[3:23:40] <C4m3r0n0409> How you think he became the JINCHURIKI
[3:23:43] <d3molitionxp3rt> !discord
[3:23:43] <InfiniteSwagbito> woolie you watched him suck it in
[3:23:45] <+oscar_m510> nah he absorbed it
[3:23:46] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus it's still a tailed beast, Obito became the holder
[3:23:46] <+supaXmugen> @WoolieVersus The Monster is a SEED that becomes a tree
[3:23:47] <%jiggy_snipe> they said it
[3:23:48] <YakumoYomi> Cursed Seal = "Money Off" Sage Mode?!
[3:23:48] <%Theycallmenerf> Are we at the point of smashing my chakra/sage into your chakra/sage that it is now Super Sentai Naurto Chakra Zords?
[3:23:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> They said he became the Jinchuuriki
[3:23:50] <VidulaSaix> The game didnt skip it
[3:23:52] <+Vivaciousx3> he literally said jinchuriki
[3:23:52] <rosemon5001> YOU LITERALLY SAW IT
[3:23:52] <MonsterEnvy> Obito absorbed it to become the Jinchuriki
[3:23:52] <C4m3r0n0409> IT WAS SHOWN
[3:23:53] <+SilverInferno3> Yes, Obito absrobed it when turning into its Jinchuuriki
[3:23:53] <redrins> they literally said it

[3:23:59] <coldfire0007> You saw it
[3:24:01] <InfiniteSwagbito> lol
[3:24:01] <+VGGary> Obito became the jinchuriki, which means he sealed it in himself like Naruto has the nine tails
[3:24:01] <Kira2993> YOU SAW IT
[3:24:01] <+GreenCMD> Woolie BLIND

[3:24:39] <alm3na1> woolieSMUG
[3:24:44] <+GreenCMD> SAY THE LINE WOOLIE sbfpSetIn
[3:24:47] <MonsterEnvy> No Obito backstabbed Madara and absorbed it
[3:24:48] <+SilverInferno3> @WoolieVersus It's explicitly against Madara's plan, Obito went rogue
[3:24:48] <%ggbhtg> It was super unclear with all the anime stills, chat
[3:24:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> this is why Woolie is so battered Kappa
[3:24:51] <0pirus> agree to disagree
[3:24:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> KISHIMOTO ISN'T THAT SMART

[3:24:59] <Shishi1205> Kinda
[3:25:00] <+VGGary> Wasn't part of the plan, obito went rogue i thought
[3:25:06] <MarkUriah> It's okay Naruto is bad
[3:25:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:25:07] <AMaidIndeed> hah tree, fruition... genuis
[3:25:09] <+Caidezes> Naruto sucks. I love it.
[3:25:14] <%Robot_Nixon_> naruto lore is dumb as balls
[3:25:15] <+SilverInferno3> But yes he turned into the Jin at that moment
[3:25:18] <muniea3> he ate the communion wafer, Woolie
[3:25:18] <Shishi1205> Madaras plan was using obito to do what obito did
[3:25:19] <+chase959> he went rouge according to plan
[3:25:20] <InfiniteSwagbito> @VGGary Obito went rogue and took the ten tails for himself, it was supposed to be madara
[3:25:21] <%legacy0117> True. It's just very different. I know, I'm just playin'.
[3:25:24] <alrobot2014> money on?

[3:25:29] <VidulaSaix> Madara tried to take control of him and revive himself but Obito resisted and absorbed the 10 tails. I think you misunderstood cause you guys were talking over that scene
[3:25:29] <MonsterEnvy> He actully backstabbed Madara. Madara was supposed to become the Jinchuriki
[3:25:29] <+VGGary> @InfiniteSwagbito yeah thats what i thought
[3:25:30] <%lotharrio> Madara tried to fuck Obito, Minato stopped that by half-killing him, Obito took that chance for a power grab.
[3:25:32] <+hoenhime344> naruto "makes sense" woolie 2020
[3:25:33] <%Theycallmenerf> NotLikeThis

[3:55:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Remembering trash
[3:55:39] <+chikitsune9> i can explain it all
[3:55:40] <Dementedpenguin> Lord, I feel bad for people who had to watch this show weekly. Filler and flashback episodes included LUL
[3:55:44] <VidulaSaix> The slideshow stuff is pretty much done now. This is about when the game caught up to the anime so everything in game had to be brand new
[3:55:45] <%optimasmaximas> oh so reggie knows
[3:55:46] <+TheDyingPride> Same
[3:55:47] <YakumoYomi> Hey, Japanese people! Do you like Japanese folklore?!
[3:55:54] <InfiniteSwagbito> as a living naruto wikipedia, this knowledge hurts
[3:55:55] <invader_rin> Same, Reggie, FUCKING SAME
[3:55:55] <+CoronetChris> SAME REGGIE
[3:55:57] <%Robot_Nixon_> I remember some, but hearing it again makes it double dumb
[3:55:59] <Klefth> You missed the MILLION FUCKING RIN FLASHBACKS?
[3:56:01] <gekizenbu> Reggie used king crimson to skip to the end
[3:56:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GOD ONE PIECE IS SO GOOD
[3:56:03] <dekkitout> It hurts to read this shit, watch this shit, then think both times- "Am I in a time loop?"
[3:56:03] <+chikitsune9> @woolieversus what is your discord
[3:56:05] <venomfury86> Stupid story aside, what do you think of the game?
[3:56:05] <%nintega010> yeah it got bad. Why I like One Piece more
[3:56:05] <lucascope16> i dont know, people still play this game?
[3:56:11] <+Ether101_Prime> The Boruto manga's better then this.
[3:56:13] <+Bluydee> the manga is not as heavy with rin flashbacks
[3:56:15] <+oscar_m510> yeah same, I read the manga and watched the anime at the same time at one point
[3:56:15] <phatmac16> Does the game show Naruto saying the coolest guy?
[3:56:17] <InfiniteSwagbito> @lucascope16 Ps4, yeah
[3:56:20] <CozyGUNNA> one piece is way better
[3:56:22] <biomegabear> it would be funny if the anime had more rin flashbacks that were missed
[3:56:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> @lucascope16 I see some people streaming this yeah
[3:56:23] <sgtgoatmilk181> this war took YEARS in the anime, the manga was painful at times but not as long obvs
[3:56:24] <Klefth> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli At least Naruto had the decency to end
[3:56:28] <%FadingEmber> This is just as shit as I remember Kappa
[3:56:31] <bunnyscruff> We're pretty close to the part where the anime went into a huge filler arc
[3:56:31] <+oscar_m510> @cozygunna but its SOOOO LONNGGG
[3:56:33] <InfiniteSwagbito> @phatmac16 I forget, but that doesn't happen till way later
[3:56:35] <%andrei11dr> I actually don't know that much about Shintob,i should probably do some research
[3:56:37] <CJL_13> The war was a third of the manga I shit you not
[3:56:39] <%nintega010> @Ether101_Prime Honestly where it is now. Yes. Yes it is
[3:56:40] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:56:40] <VidulaSaix> Not really
[3:56:42] <+supaXmugen> @nintega010 yeah, One Piece just has SHIT PEOPLE. But NOT shit characters.
[3:56:42] <MarkUriah> no
[3:56:43] <Shishi1205> NAh
[3:56:45] <phatmac16> nope
[3:56:46] <%SuperKirby24> pls no
[3:56:46] <its_sinny> nah
[3:56:47] <%Robot_Nixon_> nahhhh LUL
[3:56:49] <Klefth> You DO NOT WANT TO WATCH THAT
[3:56:49] <biomegabear> no
[3:56:50] <+thesyndrome> @WoolieVersus you need to know, in honour of obito cucking himself in his own dream world, we have dubbed his bull: Cuckashi
[3:56:50] <Mr_Rakjo> nope
[3:56:50] <releasetherats> you're not missing much tbh
[3:56:50] <+knowyourenemy_97> no
[3:56:51] <rosemon5001> woolieREGGIEFUL_BN you have been wrong today dont act like a spoiler safeguard minh
[3:56:51] <C4m3r0n0409> NOPE
[3:56:54] <Arek_1> Chat, when I read the manga week by week when it was being made, it wasn't this hamfisted.
[3:56:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @klefth because it was trashing about at least One Piece knows how to keep a story going
[3:56:55] <+Grayhammatter> sage of the simp obitos
[3:56:55] <niddron> nah you saw it all
[3:56:58] <%optimasmaximas> hoo boy
[3:56:58] <Ultzerostar00> It's probably cooler in this game
[3:56:59] <Shishi1205> There must be a video
[3:57:03] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus What you should watch is the Sasuke conversation with the Kages
[3:57:05] <@Solidus_113> There's more of that coming up
[3:57:08] <+SilverInferno3> Keep playing, yeah
[3:57:12] <InfiniteSwagbito> yeah
[3:57:16] <InfiniteSwagbito> watch Sasuke talking with the kage
[3:57:18] <Aracon_> I don't think there is any extra interactions from what you've already played
[3:57:18] <InfiniteSwagbito> it's good shit
[3:57:22] <Klefth> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Or dragging along, rather LUL
[3:57:24] <vincerocmm> vv0000 vv3 g0nna k339 g001ng
[3:57:28] <%nintega010> @supaXmugen I will always hate Akianu and BlackBeard for my reasons, but great characters
[3:57:28] <%SuperKirby24> Yeah, there's some minor details with sasuke and the kage
[3:57:32] <CozyGUNNA> u could probably finish this game today honestly lmao
[3:57:36] <YakumoYomi> One Piece's pace is my biggest problem with it. Pages and pages in fights of reaction shots from bystanders can be a bit much.
[3:57:37] <Nojomoble> could naruto talk no jutsu coronavirus
[3:57:39] <+SilverInferno3> Maybe also rewatch the scene where Obito becomes the jinchuuriki, just to clear up on that @WoolieVersus
[3:57:39] <+klholland92> Has guy done the thing yet?
[3:57:43] <%ficboyog> when minato shows up on the battlefield there is some banter between him and naruto
[3:57:43] <@Solidus_113> no
[3:57:43] <%gatorafan> Tobirama was RIGHT daedra1DerpyTibs
[3:57:46] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Nojomoble He'd find a way
[3:57:47] <C4m3r0n0409> Hes most of the way through the game now
[3:57:47] <turbofolk> You should watch ROAD TO NINJA for naruto-minato conversations
[3:57:47] <+oda_flobunaga> HE has to watch the David Kage and The Nicolas Kage
[3:57:50] <CozyGUNNA> @yakumoyomi i agree
[3:57:53] <%ggbhtg> @klholland92 hell no shhh
[3:57:53] <+Bluydee> trying to shit on one piece lffnUlt
[3:57:57] <Mexican_Duck> cant drag if the story is actually good LUL
[3:57:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @klefth not really, pacing just fine honestly, if anything its moving too fast and for good reason.
[3:58:01] <CozyGUNNA> but one piece has amazing world building
[3:58:01] <venomfury86> Tobirama's finger
[3:58:01] <@Solidus_113> Crimson Beast will be next session

[3:58:40] <venomfury86> everything before the war was okay
[3:58:40] <restlesskoi> Pirate Warriors is dope and
[3:58:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the Wano arc might as well be its own series
[3:58:41] <+Ether101_Prime> The Naruto manga was a train wreck at this point.
[3:58:43] <C4m3r0n0409> Madara is right after this
[3:58:46] <Deadbulky> Chat pls LUL
[3:58:49] <%nothuzad> mortalmanbaby the pirate warriors dont have the high quality cutscenes but I think they are more fun "games"
[3:58:57] <YakumoYomi> @mortalmanbaby Not the fighting ones, but the Musou games are pretty good in my opinion.
[3:58:57] <%ChoculaUltra> some of the One Piece games on gamecube were p dope
[3:58:58] <Shishi1205> Yes
[3:59:00] <Ultzerostar00> The Madara stuff was fun, if I remember right

[3:59:16] <%Irridium> yeah fuck that guy
[3:59:17] <+supaXmugen> @nintega010 Akainu is definitely a piece of shit. The worst part is he exists BECAUSE of how corrupt the army is. Which is why Yashitora and Coby's gang is SOOO IMPORTANT for legitimizing the Army.
[3:59:17] <Klefth> Kabuto's not petrified. He's just stuck there until he self talk-no-jutsus
[3:59:17] <+hawk_rush> It's been 82 years...

[4:00:43] <zamzoph> Jebaited
[4:00:44] <%generalve> CHOJI WAS NEVER MEANT TO DIE
[4:00:44] <phatmac16> Kishi and female characters name a more iconic duo
[4:00:46] <%GenesisKnight> We lost something "big" LUL
[4:00:46] <WickedPangolin> the whole final arc is kind of a mess

[4:01:05] <%ggbhtg> imagine if it was a cup cracking
[4:01:07] <%nothuzad> phatmac16 kishimoto and destined childhood marriages :)
[4:01:07] <Shishi1205> Fabrication
[4:01:09] <biomegabear> @generalve choji doesnt die but neji does
[4:01:10] <MarkUriah> And it made Sasuke actually have a body count that mattered
[4:01:10] <%rubbishbinge> The butterfly means cheeseburger
[4:01:12] <%Theycallmenerf> Not funny, didn't happen
[4:01:13] <restlesskoi> Kishimoto is a god at totally whiffing on character arcs
[4:01:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> A complete fabrication woolieFABRICATION
[4:01:18] <Sokumotanaka> Fuck you choji gets a happy ending, fight me
[4:01:30] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Sokumotanaka fuck yeah he does
[4:01:31] <phatmac16> Fake out deaths are the worst
[4:01:31] <muniea3> butterfly because he's fat and likes butter
[4:01:32] <Dementedpenguin> This is why Bleach used to annoy me. Too many fake outs. NotLikeThis
[4:01:32] <+chase959> choji best boy
[4:01:35] <Morning_Asakura> wanting kishi to be a good writer is asking ALOT
[4:01:37] <+SaltyGhostRock> Kishi is a bumblelord
[4:01:41] <VidulaSaix> Bad at character arcs? Karin never had an arc
[4:01:41] <+supaXmugen> @Sokumotanaka literally HALF the relationships in Boruto make NO SENSE.
[4:01:47] <VidulaSaix> She was shit from chapter 1 she appeared in
[4:01:49] <+Ether101_Prime> I think its amazing that Boruto manga isn't a shit show.
[4:01:49] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[4:01:50] <+oscar_m510> Expect for Neji...fuck
[4:01:53] <%ficboyog> also neji dies by some sticks
[4:01:56] <Morning_Asakura> neji tho
[4:01:56] <TheGershon> Still do
[4:01:57] <%ggbhtg> Character Polls LITERALLY decide the destiny
[4:01:59] <Shishi1205> Of course
[4:02:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> Yeah but the leaf village is a crater now though right? LUL
[4:02:04] <%ggbhtg> They do, it's not a meme
[4:02:07] <+SilverInferno3> See: Bokuben
[4:02:07] <Sokumotanaka> @supaXmugen Never mentioned boruto I meant him being a MVP in the war
[4:02:07] <dekkitout> @Ether101_Prime Right
[4:02:07] <Aracon_> apparently neji was too irrelevant
[4:02:08] <biomegabear> @Ether101_Prime yeah cause kishimoto isnt writing it
[4:02:08] <CJL_13> Just look at Bakugo
[4:02:09] <zamzoph> Shonen Jump is a cutthroat publication
[4:02:09] <%Sparkseid> it's super unfortunate
[4:02:10] <VidulaSaix> Neji's death is so bad. He literally only died to push Hinata onto that dick
[4:02:10] <%nothuzad> neji dies by some stick but every other naruto friend is fine :)
[4:02:11] <mdkcde> Sasuke's popularity ruined naruto
[4:02:12] <VidulaSaix> It was so pointless
[4:02:15] <LokimenD> *Laughs in One Piece*
[4:02:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YEP
[4:02:18] <+chase959> Neji dies twice. once to the spider and then again in the exact same manor
[4:02:20] <venomfury86> Minato and Kushina were okay
[4:02:21] <Aracon_> he got smoked by some sticks hinata could've easily avoided
[4:02:21] <phatmac16> It happened in Bleach with Hitsugaya
[4:02:21] <%GenesisKnight> Neji died as the ultimate wingman
[4:02:31] <+supaXmugen> @Sokumotanaka oh. I thought you meant Choji getting the Cloud village girl.
[4:02:32] <mdkcde> Samurai 8
[4:02:32] <CJL_13> @scrublord009 Samurai 8
[4:02:34] <%jiggy_snipe> @VidulaSaix that's why people created that Eugenics meme to salvage the death
[4:02:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> @scrublord009 yeah Samurai 8
[4:02:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Isnt Trafalgar Law like high on the list
[4:02:37] <Zohare> Attack on Ttitan has a character that lived longer because a fan liked them
[4:02:38] <biomegabear> samurai 8

[4:02:47] <%DashXero> Lookin' forward to hearin' it!
[4:02:50] <%OUTheTeam> somehow bleach managaed to be even worse
[4:02:53] <YakumoYomi> @supaXmugen I feel like a lot of the Boruto pairings were simply so you could have a "new generation" without needing to invent new characters to be parents
[4:02:53] <+Ether101_Prime> @biomegabear Its litterly handling the same stuff as we're seeing right now.
[4:02:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> @scrublord009 no
[4:02:54] <C4m3r0n0409> Apparently noone read it
[4:03:00] <dekkitout> @Zohare Imma guess Jean?
[4:03:02] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[4:03:03] <flowdere> Neji died for nothing when everyone else got to live

[4:03:08] <InfiniteSwagbito> LEE IS SO BUSTED

[4:03:25] <InfiniteSwagbito> PRETTY MUCH
[4:03:25] <nobody12349> As he should be
[4:03:25] <mdkcde> Hey Woolie, remember that Cloud Ninjas used to capture female bloodline users to make Cloud Bloodline users because they didn't have many.
[4:03:28] <niddron> nah deidara was the most busted
[4:03:29] <mortalmanbaby> minato in 4 is busted
[4:03:30] <Sokumotanaka> @supaXmugen Nah she deserved Omoi although I kinda like chou chou she's cute and sassy Naruto ends for me after chpt 700
[4:03:34] <InfiniteSwagbito> HE'S GOT REALLY GOOD CIRCLE
[4:03:34] <MarkUriah> his combo game is strong
[4:03:36] <mdkcde> but naah Bakayaro, Konoyaro!
[4:03:37] <%gatorafan> Gintama had this amazing series of coincidences with a character landing on the same spot in EVERY SINGLE poll.
[4:03:38] <%legacy0117> Yay I can see again. Had fun guys? ^^
[4:03:40] <%ggbhtg> Rock Lee Dynamic Entry, plus transformation buff equals BUSTED
[4:03:42] <dekkitout> Lee holding down the fact that the 8 gates are busted as shit LUL
[4:03:42] <+Gutsandlove> as he should
[4:03:45] <niddron> Deidara could win you matches with just hitting square
[4:03:49] <restlesskoi> Lee, continuing to show that he is the best character in the seies
[4:03:50] <venomfury86> Demon Slayer is a good manga
[4:03:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ALL FOR RIN
[4:03:52] <@Solidus_113> HE WAS THE COOLEST GUY

[4:04:04] <+colezone_> colezone_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:04:04] <Aracon_> YEAH WHAT A COOL CHARACTER
[4:04:07] <BlackermanZX> obito is a simp
[4:04:08] <%Irridium> @gatorafan the character poll arc was pretty great not gonna lie
[4:04:09] <InfiniteSwagbito> there's a lot to unpack
[4:04:10] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[4:04:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THE MASTERMIND

[4:04:12] <%DashXero> Yeah...
[4:04:13] <+oscar_m510> yeah it's pretty fucked
[4:04:15] <dekkitout> Didn't that happen in Madoka Magica?
[4:04:16] <zaitje> He is the coolest though
[4:04:20] <mortalmanbaby> dont forget that madara kinda fucked him up
[4:04:22] <+WeepProphet> Madara did nothing wrong
[4:04:23] <fairore> rin was a 6 man
[4:04:25] <%Sparkseid> SUCH A COOL GUY Kappa
[4:04:28] <phatmac16> HE'S THE COOLEST GUY
[4:04:28] <+NiSoKr> To be fair it is canon that Uchihas have a broken brain
[4:04:28] <%ChoculaUltra> Samurai 8 was some ass tho tbh. Kishimoto should feel relieved he doesn't have to keep shitting that out.
[4:04:29] <+oscar_m510> yeah Fake Madara is Obito
[4:04:31] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus He's also responsible for the Akatsuki as a whole. He created Pain
[4:04:34] <fairore> why Tobin why
[4:04:37] <%jiggy_snipe> he's treating as different characters
[4:04:47] <flowdere> Sharingan makes you emotional
[4:04:49] <Aracon_> but in reality it was obito
[4:04:51] <+supaXmugen> Madara is just an old dud
[4:04:54] <YakumoYomi> It all goes back to Obito (although Madara manipulated him somewhat).
[4:04:54] <+supaXmugen> *dude
[4:04:55] <%Superbro64> madara: "man bro, you didnt have to go THAT hard. damn"
[4:04:55] <venomfury86> WATCH SASUKE TALKING TO THE HOKAGE
[4:04:58] <+oscar_m510> Masked Man is not Madara, Obito is the Masked Man
[4:05:01] <mortalmanbaby> madara trcked him emotinally and used him
[4:05:02] <+Ether101_Prime> @WeepProphet Madara is upset that the 2nd Hokage didn't let his brother kill him.
[4:05:03] <thejuji> samurai 8 had a potential
[4:05:05] <hamahiroyuki> woah, im starting to hate obito more than sasuke
[4:05:06] <%OUTheTeam> madara set it up, obito is just a easily manipulated bitch
[4:05:08] <rosemon5001> obito was just the tool the plan was allways madaras
[4:05:09] <TheGershon> Coolest guy
[4:05:19] <C4m3r0n0409> RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING
[4:05:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> MADARA WAS DEAD THE WHOLE TIME, MAN
[4:05:20] <Morning_Asakura> samurai 8 had negative potential
[4:05:20] <biomegabear> So if you were to end it on pain, you would have a better ending
[4:05:23] <phatmac16> THE COOLEST GUY
[4:05:25] <+TheDankDemon> he killed minato
[4:05:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> THE UCHIHA ARE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE FREAKS. BUILD THAT WALL
[4:05:26] <InfiniteSwagbito> woolie is right
[4:05:26] <%generalve> manipulation
[4:05:28] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @scrublord009
[4:05:29] <hagakure114> even the filler is his fault
[4:05:31] <bigwoodswinger> madara pushed him down this path though
[4:05:36] <%DashXero> The dominos stopped, and Obito just kept pushing them down.
[4:05:36] <NiktenKing> Madara set the dominos up, Madara knocked them down
[4:05:41] <Aracon_> obito being omega horny for a dead girl
[4:05:41] <phatmac16> killing his parents
[4:05:43] <+oscar_m510> Obito created the Akatsuki with them not even realizing it
[4:05:48] <%BisoromiBear> the coolest guy
[4:05:50] <+supaXmugen> Obito could have just said "No."
[4:05:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[4:05:53] <%optimasmaximas> BECAUSE NARUTO IS DUMB

[4:06:01] <turbofolk> Woolie Your Naruto-minato interactions are in ROAD TO NINJA movie
[4:06:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> Yeah if anything about the whole thing is underplayed it's the fact that Madara manipulated Obito into becoming the way he is
[4:06:09] <NiktenKing> Tobi played his own dominos
[4:06:11] <Shishi1205> LUL
[4:06:13] <NorthGrizzly> Forgiven the ultimate power

[4:06:35] <Profmcsteevie> his brains still under that rock
[4:06:42] <crossing_mao> Obito sucks because he wasn’t #TEAMSNEK
[4:06:42] <+Ether101_Prime> Just wait until he realizes that the 3rd Hokage is a horrible person.
[4:06:48] <@Solidus_113> He was kid nalt
[4:06:48] <%ggbhtg> Shit Kids, at it again
[4:06:49] <+VGGary> he was a pure shounen back then

[4:07:11] <Davojam> Last arc is garbage asf atpCap
[4:07:11] <CJL_13> The Uchiha can control the Kyuubi
[4:07:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:07:15] <flowdere> 3rd hokage gave itachi the okay to kill uchiha even though he talks about peace a lot
[4:07:21] <VidulaSaix> Obito didnt SUMMON Kurama. He pulled it out of Kushina
[4:07:21] <+oscar_m510> no
[4:07:21] <%lotharrio> Obito basically did a summon while Kushina's seal was weak on it because of the birth.
[4:07:22] <redrins> sharingan
[4:07:23] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus
[4:07:23] <@Solidus_113> Obito was during the 3rd/4th's time

[4:07:44] <C4m3r0n0409> Not Summon
[4:07:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> PULLED IT FROM KUSHINA
[4:07:44] <InfiniteSwagbito> summoning isn't a unique thing

[4:07:54] <awildgooseappears> it was inside kushina
[4:07:55] <redrins> he took it from kushina
[4:07:57] <ahairysuprise> No
[4:07:57] <Klefth> He didn't "summon" the Kyuubi, he ripped it out of Naruto's mom
[4:08:00] <%Sparkseid> Ripped from Kushina
[4:08:02] <+supaXmugen> Itachi was willing to control his own Brother with Shisuis Sharigan to get him to join the leaf
[4:08:03] <+VGGary> Sharingan genjutsu
[4:08:04] <%ficboyog> he had to wait until naruto mom was almost dead
[4:08:04] <C4m3r0n0409> SHARINGAN
[4:08:05] <+SilverInferno3> @WoolieVersus With the sharingan
[4:08:05] <%Prinnylordninjocity> Took it from kushina
[4:08:06] <+oscar_m510> He uses the sharigan to control the Ninetails but yeah the Ninetails was out of kushina
[4:08:07] <Mr_Rakjo> Obito had to wait till Kushina was almost dead @WoolieVersus . Madara just straight up called him
[4:08:07] <Shishi1205> Sharingan
[4:08:08] <%Sparkseid> Sharingan
[4:08:09] <%optimasmaximas> he has the same summoning as madara
[4:08:10] <Zebroneath> Sharigan
[4:08:11] <VidulaSaix> Yes
[4:08:11] <+JimJimmyBim> He used Sharingan to control it he never summoned it
[4:08:12] <InfiniteSwagbito> yes
[4:08:12] <%optimasmaximas> sharingan
[4:08:12] <%Sparkseid> yes
[4:08:12] <Zohare> Yes?
[4:08:13] <InfiniteSwagbito> right away
[4:08:14] <rosemon5001> the control was whit the fucking eyes god damn
[4:08:14] <C4m3r0n0409> YES
[4:08:15] <cheaddos> yes
[4:08:15] <phatmac16> HE chained her up and used sharingan
[4:08:15] <+chase959> sharigan genjutsu
[4:08:15] <+knowyourenemy_97> yes
[4:08:15] <VidulaSaix> They showed it in the last game
[4:08:17] <MarkUriah> He took it out and then controlled it with sharingan
[4:08:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> PULLED FROM KUSHINA CONTROLLED WITH SHARINGAN
[4:08:18] <Arek_1> Obito had to wait until the seal weakened because of childbirth.
[4:08:18] <redrins> sharingan just does that
[4:08:19] <phatmac16> yup
[4:08:22] <crossing_mao> Put his hands on someone else’s wife
[4:08:23] <dekkitout> Magic eyes answer all questions in Naruto
[4:08:25] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Obito has one of Madara's eyes as well to amp up his power anyway
[4:08:26] <%NWannabe> dude the sharingan can do Anything
[4:08:28] <%gatorafan> Reminder that Kushina's seal was super weak because she was giving birth.
[4:08:29] <InfiniteSwagbito> ripped it out, mindcontrolled
[4:08:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> What CANT the red eye magic do?
[4:08:32] <%lotharrio> Kyubi hates Uchiha because the Sharingan can do that shit to him.
[4:08:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sharingan is plot power
[4:08:35] <+oscar_m510> Yeah pretty much
[4:08:37] <Mr_Rakjo> Obito had to wait till Kushina was almost dead @WoolieVersus . Madara just straight up called him cause he is OP.
[4:08:38] <Sokumotanaka> Wait what are we pulling out of kushina? Kappa
[4:08:38] <+NiSoKr> He just has to look a it to control it
[4:08:39] <%nintega010> Sharingan is busted
[4:08:40] <%Robot_Nixon_> because eye magic Kappa
[4:08:45] <MarkUriah> Yes
[4:08:47] <+SilverInferno3> @WoolieVersus Remember Sasuke could see into Naruto and interact with the Kyuubi with his sharingan too
[4:08:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Not necessarily summoned it
[4:08:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ive stopped trying to figure out what Sharingan does
[4:08:57] <Zohare> Madara found it or summoned it
[4:08:57] <flowdere> Sharingan just easy modes tailed beasts
[4:08:58] <venomfury86> It would be better if Pain was the main antagonist and Tobi being just an idiot
[4:09:01] <Nobuwaroo> summoning is just a glorified teleportation technique anyway.
[4:09:05] <invader_rin> Sharingan is super dumb
[4:09:05] <InfiniteSwagbito> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli it does what the plot demands
[4:09:09] <%andrei11dr> Madara being just an asshole is better than Obito, facts
[4:09:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> The sharingan can do your taxes, mow your lawn and water your plants
[4:09:11] <%rubbishbinge> It was just a weird wild pokemon
[4:09:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> exactly
[4:09:16] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe he made a pact like any summon
[4:09:18] <NiktenKing> No he kept her bound during her weakest point (which was childbirth) and pulled it out while putting it in a genjutsu control
[4:09:19] <Damie904> I think that was game only
[4:09:23] <Mr_Rakjo> Obito had to wait till Kushina was almost dead @WoolieVersus . Madara just straight up called him cause he is OP..
[4:09:24] <+SilverInferno3> @WoolieVersus Madara captured him, he's just OP, God of shinobi, it was never specifically covered
[4:09:26] <WickedPangolin> he captured it
[4:09:29] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus We don't know how he summoned it, but controlling it is via Sharingan
[4:09:30] <+supaXmugen> The manga never explained it
[4:09:30] <BlackermanZX> madara captured him
[4:09:31] <flowdere> Sharingan could teach you how to do greatest nae nae
[4:09:33] <%nintega010> This is why Sarada is gonna be broken in the future. Combining Sakura strength with Sharingan is a godly combination
[4:09:36] <mortalmanbaby> they dont tell u
[4:09:37] <InfiniteSwagbito> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli There is a rule set on what it does, but I have a hard time caring enough to elaborate to people who don't feel like knowing anyway lol
[4:09:37] <+supaXmugen> He just had Kurama
[4:09:38] <C4m3r0n0409> No pact
[4:09:39] <+TheDyingPride> Madara's just THAT GOOD
[4:09:40] <%Reverend_Roscoe> IT'S NOT EXPLAINED
[4:09:41] <phatmac16> he captured him
[4:09:41] <BlackermanZX> he just teleported him
[4:09:42] <MarkUriah> He captured it no pact
[4:09:43] <%gatorafan> Madara's number is VERY BIG
[4:09:44] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus I think the problem is you still seem stuck in the mindset that the kyuubi is this mystical legendary creature when it's really no different than the other giant kaiju animals. He just found him somewhere and put him under his control
[4:09:49] <C4m3r0n0409> DONT WORRY TOO MUCH
[4:09:50] <+oscar_m510> I actually don't remember that either I think he did do a pact with the Ninetails but honestly idk
[4:09:53] <ahairysuprise> Hasharama’s wife?
[4:09:56] <@Solidus_113> don't think about it
[4:09:59] <@Solidus_113> it's not explained

[4:10:09] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SHUT UP, THAT'S WHY
[4:10:15] <+supaXmugen> He literally controls it with his Sharingen
[4:10:16] <+OddityOn> wait did this stream just start?
[4:10:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> dont worry about it
[4:10:20] <%Solidnick18> still more to come
[4:10:25] <InfiniteSwagbito> Madara dominated the nine-tails completely
[4:10:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> @oddityon nah they're wrapping up
[4:10:30] <dekkitout> Mad Lad Madara doesn't follow any rules, period.
[4:10:32] <%optimasmaximas> madara had a summon seal on the hyuubi NotLikeThis
[4:10:36] <Malik1002> nope ending

[4:10:38] <+OddityOn> Dammit I didn't get any notif
[4:10:41] <%emperordread> Woolie will not figure it out - the writing for the end of Naruto is pure garbage

[4:14:02] <%jiggy_snipe> everyone in this manga and anime are shit people
[4:14:02] <BlackermanZX> "Take care of my son" said minato
[4:14:03] <hamahiroyuki> but the dead came back tho
[4:14:06] <%rubbishbinge> IT'S NO USE

[4:14:14] <NorthGrizzly> They cut the worst where Uchiha are bunch brain broken dipshit
[4:14:15] <+TheDyingPride> Wait yeah! The dead DID come back
[4:14:15] <%generalve> LUL
[4:14:16] <%Solidnick18> they ain't dead
[4:14:16] <DrStinkers> The kids like to feel the hair on Saruobi's leges
[4:14:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> RESURRECTION LITERALLY EXISTS THOUGH
[4:14:18] <mortalmanbaby> thats what happns when you dont plan your stories
[4:14:19] <Reizie_Etherealm> As opposed to Naruto
[4:14:19] <Shishi1205> One not anymore
[4:14:20] <TheGershon> I guess it explains why Naruto had his own house and a food allowance
[4:14:20] <%Solidnick18> go to swing chan

[4:14:24] <vincerocmm> s0//y na/ 1 93/f3/ saka
[4:14:24] <+Ether101_Prime> Isn't the 3rd ubducting their god son part of the rebellion too?
[4:14:26] <+knowyourenemy_97> The third had no reason to keep the secrets away from Naruto
[4:14:29] <invader_rin> That's the joke, chat
[4:14:30] <biomegabear> sleep on the swing
[4:14:37] <%emeraldskrull> But if Sarutobi told him the truth then naruto wouldn't have the drive to become a great hard working ninja! woolieSMUG
[4:14:37] <phatmac16> JUST TALK
[4:14:37] <%Reverend_Roscoe> THE THIRD HAD NO REASON TO DO ANYTHING HE DID
[4:14:39] <%optimasmaximas> swing chan is your only family
[4:14:40] <1matheuw> are w done yet?
[4:14:43] <+oscar_m510> Imma go and make another orphan child
[4:14:43] <NorthGrizzly> Tobirama was so right
[4:14:45] <+supaXmugen> Resurrection EXISTS! You just need to sacrifice some people.
[4:14:45] <%gatorafan> Kurama was there too :)
[4:14:46] <+Psycosis> Kishimoto is such a shit writer
[4:14:48] <%GenesisKnight> All the adults are retroactively dicks
[4:14:50] <Ultzerostar00> He could have adopted him
[4:14:56] <%LordSDB> With Spoiled milk
[4:14:58] <biomegabear> thats dark that tobirama was right
[4:15:03] <hamahiroyuki> naruto's apartament was shitty tho
[4:15:05] <Kira2993> nah
[4:15:06] <VidulaSaix> That's an aggressively bad take
[4:15:08] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Reverend_Roscoe dude why are you still on this, only one person knew the technique and there's the whole "morality" thing of bringing the dead back, assuming they could
[4:15:09] <venomfury86> This means Orochimaru was right for killing Sarutobi
[4:15:15] <%optimasmaximas> that donator is prtty dumb
[4:15:18] <%lotharrio> Reminder, every famous Uchiha at one point or another, killed their best friend/lover, and the very strongest also murdered their family to steal their eyes. That's how they upgrade their eye power shit.
[4:15:21] <phatmac16> dumb answer
[4:15:22] <%FadingEmber> I agree
[4:15:24] <Morning_Asakura> what
[4:15:26] <%nothuzad> enforcing your onw opinion :)
[4:15:30] <dekkitout> Fair
[4:15:30] <%optimasmaximas> assasnine
[4:15:31] <Shishi1205> Lore is important
[4:15:31] <%jiggy_snipe> don't spoil anything, its very simple lol
[4:15:34] <%Sparkseid> Wow, definitely do not agree
[4:15:35] <%BisoromiBear> all smoilers are bad smoilers
[4:15:41] <NorthGrizzly> Uchiha are the shitty clan
[4:15:45] <%Superbro64> people have some SMOOTH brains huh
[4:15:45] <phatmac16> don't be an asshole and let people enjoy things
[4:15:47] <Morning_Asakura> big disagree
[4:15:48] <ahairysuprise> I disagree
[4:15:51] <TheGershon> "Spoilers are okay if I don't care about them"
[4:15:52] <Arek_1> Except with Naruto. LUL
[4:15:54] <%gatorafan> But Maximum Impact was a super bad KOF Kappa
[4:15:55] <%sshen> @lotharrio that's not actually true, Shisuis eyes weren't from friend murder
[4:15:57] <phatmac16> don't be that guy
[4:15:57] <%nintega010> Boy One Piece does that in spads
[4:15:59] <+knowyourenemy_97> @emeraldskrull that got retcon tho with the to know what
[4:16:02] <dekkitout> Intended as in intended for the self?
[4:16:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> How they retroactively made Sarutobi a shitbag reminds me of Steven universe but at least it was on purpose in that show
[4:16:07] <+Grayhammatter> big disagree with that donator
[4:16:10] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine donating just to share such a shit opinion on spoilers
[4:16:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> We are fighting dreamers!
[4:16:22] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @InfiniteSwagbito because it's happened so many times that it's ridiculous. it's like how death in dragon ball has no meaning anymore, cuz you just get wished back
[4:16:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fighting dreamers
[4:16:29] <+Psycosis> Just do what Pat does and guess everything
[4:16:30] <YakumoYomi> @gatorafan Luise is bae, tho!
[4:16:30] <%DatAsuna> I think it's only half thecase
[4:16:37] <+SilverInferno3> But hey thanks for the dono :)

[4:17:40] <InfiniteSwagbito> @WoolieVersus chicken block is some pvp tech
[4:17:43] <+MrRabbles> you take the moon
[4:17:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie is gonna suffer through some wipeouts later on just wait

[4:18:01] <Shishi1205> Yeah antieverything
[4:18:05] <VidulaSaix> I vaguely recall that but dunno specifics
[4:18:05] <+TheDyingPride> *shrug*
[4:18:08] <Zohare> I think they make whatever touches it disappear
[4:18:09] <%Irridium> that's fuckin' stupid
[4:18:10] <%Superbro64> truth seeker orbs delete you on touch entirely @WoolieVersus
[4:18:11] <%MadGioNo> Yeah it eats anything but natural energy
[4:18:16] <Arek_1> Truth-Seeking Balls.
[4:18:17] <phatmac16> yup
[4:18:18] <InfiniteSwagbito> it's basically antimatter
[4:18:18] <Kira2993> basically
[4:18:18] <%DashXero> It was really dumb.
[4:18:19] <Lord_Toucan_Sam> get that penis pump out
[4:18:21] <MarkUriah> Its like Darkside's Laser Eyes

[4:18:23] <phatmac16> yes
[4:18:25] <%bread_assassin> Yeah, like they're antimatter or somethin'
[4:18:26] <InfiniteSwagbito> everything it touches gets erased
[4:18:27] <%Irridium> how the fuck you gonna sit in a chair with those
[4:18:27] <%lotharrio> It might be that it cancels the zombies out, specifically?
[4:18:29] <RetroCop87> isn't rasenshuriken supposed to cause damage at the cellular level? shouldn't that be able to kill Cell-tier bullshit villains?
[4:18:30] <dekkitout> It perma kills the Revenants
[4:18:30] <Mr_Rakjo> Anything but natural Energy get Erased @WoolieVersus
[4:18:31] <%Irridium> sleep in a bed
[4:18:36] <therakishsage> I might not fully understand the nonsense magic of Madara's Infinite Tsukoyomi, but even if you reflected it off of a perfect full moon with clear skies on the entire hemisphere of the planet that it would be visible from, why would it affect people who are, I'unno, asleep? Like most people are at night? And as such NOT looking up at the sky and the moon specifically?
[4:18:38] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus another game tip, you can hold X to charge a chakra dash, you'll move forward much faster
[4:18:39] <irfan_> obito CAN make it explode in size
[4:18:40] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[4:18:40] <Klefth> They're a fusion of all chakra elements and they eat shit

[4:18:48] <+SilverInferno3> Not wrong
[4:18:49] <%Reverend_Roscoe> BULLSHIT
[4:18:51] <mdkcde> he was too soft
[4:18:52] <C4m3r0n0409> Not really
[4:18:54] <%jiggy_snipe> not wrong
[4:18:54] <MarkUriah> Kinda
[4:18:55] <C4m3r0n0409> NOOO
[4:18:55] <%NWannabe> Nah, Madara was a shit before
[4:18:56] <Mr_Rakjo> Not really
[4:18:58] <Damie904> Yes
[4:18:58] <%ECRead> EXCEPT IT WASN'T
[4:18:58] <Shishi1205> Ah
[4:18:59] <%jiggy_snipe> he's a dick
[4:18:59] <%rubbishbinge> fair
[4:18:59] <%bread_assassin> Ok, so Obito sucks, but Madara......sucks less.
[4:18:59] <InfiniteSwagbito> Tobirama was the 2nd hokage
[4:19:00] <rosemon5001> 50 50
[4:19:01] <+knowyourenemy_97> yes
[4:19:01] <dekkitout> Yes and no
[4:19:03] <MarkUriah> No he wasnt
[4:19:03] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus theyre omega beams cred @MarkUriah
[4:19:03] <%Reverend_Roscoe> THEY WERE SHIT BEFORE THAT
[4:19:04] <phatmac16> yes and no
[4:19:04] <InfiniteSwagbito> Tobirama fucking hated the uchiha
[4:19:04] <%ChoculaUltra> my question is - why didn't Obito just genjutsu himself into his own private Rin Onlyfans world
[4:19:06] <mdkcde> he should have gone final solution on them
[4:19:06] <%lotharrio> Uchiha are dangerously unstable to begin with.
[4:19:10] <Mr_Rakjo> They were dicks Before the 2nd
[4:19:10] <+NiSoKr> Yes
[4:19:10] <+SilverInferno3> Pushing people into ghettos will make them spiteful
[4:19:10] <Damie904> Tobirama was Wakka
[4:19:14] <%BisoromiBear> Tobirama had no chill, but for a good reason.
[4:19:16] <+dredgyboi> Well madara expected to be Second hokage and was salty he wasnt
[4:19:17] <C4m3r0n0409> Madara was always a shit
[4:19:17] <dekkitout> Tobi was VERY based about the Uchiha
[4:19:25] <VidulaSaix> For the most part yes. The Uchiha still has their crazies, but the entire clan grew resentment because of what Tobirama did to them @WoolieVersus
[4:19:26] <Shishi1205> Then years later
[4:19:28] <%GenesisKnight> They were pissed about becoming cops
[4:19:29] <rosemon5001> @WoolieVersus they were made cops to be kept an eye on
[4:19:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> TOBIRAMA WAS RACIST BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY CRAZY
[4:19:33] <Zohare> Tobi kinda made it happen but then Danzo made it happen
[4:19:35] <%jiggy_snipe> pushing people in ghettos tends to make them madder
[4:19:39] <YakumoYomi> "Marginalized People"
[4:19:42] <C4m3r0n0409> They were already crazy
[4:19:42] <%jiggy_snipe> it's literally a cycle of bs
[4:19:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> Grand Wizard Tobirama LUL
[4:19:50] <+thesw1tch> what about that guy who genocides a whole lineage so he can have their eyes?
[4:19:52] <%NWannabe> DID madara want to be 2nd?
[4:19:53] <+MrRabbles> let my people go
[4:19:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> muh cycle of hatred
[4:20:01] <NiktenKing> No, Tobirama gave them the extra push, but nobody really like the Uchiha, even with the First's approval. Making them the police made people dislike them even more.
[4:20:02] <+thesw1tch> danbo
[4:20:07] <slim_shady2019> Tobirama made 80% of the ninja bullshit everyone uses
[4:20:07] <hamahiroyuki> obito prolly was born after tobirama's lifetime and influence tho
[4:20:07] <+thesw1tch> danno
[4:20:10] <%GenesisKnight> Madara wanted to be the 1st
[4:20:14] <InfiniteSwagbito> it was a domino among others
[4:20:14] <VidulaSaix> What @NiktenKing said
[4:20:17] <%BisoromiBear> Danzo was right too
[4:20:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @NWannabe yeah, but nobody voted for him
[4:20:17] <%rubbishbinge> Hashirama made them cops, Tobirama made them viewed as gestapo
[4:20:21] <%optimasmaximas> danzo is an ass
[4:20:25] <%jiggy_snipe> Danzo is also a dick
[4:20:25] <+thesw1tch> they did not like him
[4:20:26] <+TheDyingPride> Danzo was just a power hungry fuck
[4:20:27] <+SilverInferno3> Danzo was just a worse Tobirama
[4:20:27] <%optimasmaximas> thats why
[4:20:28] <mdkcde> Itachi was so marginalized he made it into ANBU by 8 instead of 5 like a regula privileged ninja
[4:20:28] <Mr_Rakjo> Danzo is an ass
[4:20:30] <%Kriss1827> danzo was jelly
[4:20:31] <Kira2993> Danzo was just a huge dick

[4:20:33] <MarkUriah> Danzo was the 2nds fanboy
[4:20:35] <C4m3r0n0409> Danzo fucked the Uchicha
[4:20:38] <dekkitout> Danzo was Tobi's pupil
[4:20:39] <Damie904> Woolie, Danzo literally had their eyeballs in his arm.
[4:20:39] <%rubbishbinge> Danzo is jelly
[4:20:39] <C4m3r0n0409> Uchiha
[4:20:42] <%sshen> Danzo was stealing their eyes

[4:21:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Accept your lot in life Uchiha scum
[4:21:52] <mdkcde> that's why ever baby had to go
[4:21:57] <Shishi1205> years passed
[4:21:57] <+SilverInferno3> @WoolieVersus Basically, despite the Village being made to promote peace and integration between clans, the Uchiha still felt marginalized and targeted, and Tobirama and Danzo's policies made that worse. Hence the plans for a coup.
[4:22:00] <%MadGioNo> Woolie by the time danzo was in power this was already going on
[4:22:00] <%jiggy_snipe> wasn't the village started by the Senju and Uchiha and other clans came later?
[4:22:00] <%ECRead> Uchiha never stopped hating the Senju
[4:22:08] <C4m3r0n0409> Tobirama was way gone
[4:22:11] <Reizie_Etherealm> I never would have imagined we'd be having serious Naruto universe discussions like it's a forum LUL
[4:22:13] <+Ether101_Prime> It was the elders after the 4th died that cased the rebellion.
[4:22:13] <+Jerimoi> @crossing_mao i got that sonic speed
[4:22:15] <VidulaSaix> What @SilverInferno3 said is a good summary
[4:22:19] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @NiktenKing
[4:22:26] <C4m3r0n0409> Tobirama was gone when that happened
[4:22:26] <%lotharrio> Well cause here's the thing. The narrative needs to make Itachi's mass murder legitimate. So like... fuck the Uchiha I guess.
[4:22:27] <MarkUriah> They had reason to revolt but they are also a clan with overpowered magic eyes that get stronger by murder
[4:22:30] <mdkcde> Itachi confirmed for Uncle Tom, a real House Ninja LUL
[4:22:33] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Most people didn't like the Uchiha because of their war crimes, even with the First's approval, so they were contested. Tobirama gave them an extra push because they were turned into police which made it worsen. Danzo fucked up the situation even worse by extinguishing Shisui's plans to unite the village under peace. Tobirama also had his own apprentice because he knew they weren't all bad
[4:22:47] <RetroCop87> Kishimoto never thought this through, most of it was thought of after the fact
[4:22:52] <Shishi1205> yyes
[4:22:53] <VidulaSaix> Facts LUL
[4:22:53] <venomfury86> Danzo: "i want to protect the village" So, where were you when Pain attacked the village, Danzo?
[4:22:54] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @NiktenKing there brah
[4:22:55] <%jiggy_snipe> Hashirama liked the Uchiha tho
[4:22:58] <%Livelinne> !schedule
[4:22:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1252638347819986945
[4:23:01] <Shishi1205> you mean the same?
[4:23:01] <Kira2993> oh yes LUL
[4:23:01] <NiktenKing> thanks
[4:23:02] <irfan_> KABUTO WAS RIGHT
[4:23:02] <+SilverInferno3> Almost like a common enemy helps unity.... hmmmmm....
[4:23:03] <+kyh9> KABUTO WAS RIGHT
[4:23:05] <C4m3r0n0409> Kabuto won LUL
[4:23:06] <mortalmanbaby> i feel like danzo also pussed it that way to get them eyes
[4:23:09] <+Xraidersama> Kabuto was the real Naruto
[4:23:10] <MarkUriah> WAR = PEACE
[4:23:10] <NiktenKing> I can't make it too concise
[4:23:11] <%OUTheTeam> thanks hitlrr
[4:23:12] <+kyh9> Kabuto is right
[4:23:18] <+OddityOn> #KabutoWasRight
[4:23:18] <%lotharrio> Was is peace. Hate is love.
[4:23:20] <vincerocmm> 01L
[4:23:20] <Reizie_Etherealm> JUMP START THE WAR ECONOMY??
[4:23:21] <phatmac16> PAIN WAS RIGHT
[4:23:21] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus tobirama was the inciting incident, and danzo/sarutobi era was the festering of that
[4:23:23] <%Djinnazz> Race war to unite the ppl
[4:23:27] <%emeraldskrull> ninja war...ninja war has changed woolieGASM woolieGLORY
[4:23:27] <%sshen> Danzo wanted uchiha eyes too
[4:23:28] <Klefth> Kabuto did nothing.... wrong???
[4:23:30] <%ECRead> Pain was super right
[4:23:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> BASED ACCELARITIONISM
[4:23:33] <dekkitout> I mean, do war hard enough and no one will want to do war ever...
[4:23:34] <Zayasu> LUL
[4:23:34] <+WeepProphet> race war for peace
[4:23:36] <+TheDyingPride> Spill innocent blood to bring the peace
[4:23:36] <crossing_mao> Totes not for the money
[4:23:38] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:23:39] <%sshen> Easier to steal eyes from dead bodies
[4:23:45] <+7od_failure> accelerationism is not what you think it is
[4:23:54] <Arek_1> Minh is no-selling philosophy. LUL
[4:23:54] <MarkUriah> I feel like Mihn is strong against Talk No Jutsu
[4:23:55] <+liquidzr0> cvHazmat
[4:24:00] <mortalmanbaby> @sshen exactly
[4:24:00] <+AXL808> acceleration- ism? no brakes on this bitch!
[4:24:01] <%Djinnazz> Like Illidan from WoW
[4:24:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> No kidding tho accelerationists are scum tho
[4:24:11] <+SilverInferno3> Keep all this in mind boyos
[4:24:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> BASED
[4:24:12] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[4:24:16] <C4m3r0n0409> THATS KABUTO
[4:24:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> MASS SHOOTING
[4:24:18] <irfan_> WOOLIE NO
[4:24:19] <+7od_failure> accelerationism is not what you think it is
[4:24:19] <%Irridium> big brain play right there
[4:24:20] <OldManDeckardCain> basically antifa shiet
[4:24:20] <C4m3r0n0409> LITERALLY KABUTO
[4:24:22] <%Kriss1827> WOOLIE NO
[4:24:24] <dekkitout> So that thing all those 300 iq villains in fiction do
[4:24:27] <SquigglyLizard> woolie no
[4:24:28] <%GrassCannon> Soundbite Get!
[4:24:34] <@Solidus_113> Kabuto brought Madara back
[4:24:36] <MarkUriah> Im so inspired by Woolie
[4:24:38] <+Magick_Man> MINH NO
[4:24:38] <biomegabear> does kabuto ever get out?
[4:24:40] <%lotharrio> You wanna smoke, 13 year old? Well here's ten packs. SMOKE.
[4:24:45] <Shishi1205> monkaS cvHazmat
[4:24:45] <+TheDyingPride> Just a prank
[4:24:49] <%emeraldskrull> it's a joke haha...unless???
[4:24:50] <Arek_1> This will be the PATRIOT ACT all over again.
[4:24:53] <BlackermanZX> i mean some people are doing stupid shit already

[4:25:14] <Mrthefro> Make Kaiji a reality
[4:25:16] <rilou501> Being in NS... That's a yike from me
[4:25:17] <SillyRookie> Supersonic by Bad Religion
[4:25:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> "We'll use war as a business to END war as a business"

[4:25:27] <TheGershon> Dr, Manhattan vibes

[4:25:30] <%jiggy_snipe> Power probably
[4:25:31] <Zohare> Orochimaru's dick
[4:25:31] <+Xraidersama> Kabuto wants the true meaning of christmas
[4:25:31] <biomegabear> orochimaru's power?
[4:25:32] <Kira2993> just vibing
[4:25:33] <+SaltyGhostRock> DR KABUTOTTAN
[4:25:34] <C4m3r0n0409> @biomegabear yes
[4:25:36] <Zayasu> friends BibleThump
[4:25:36] <%Bryantisbadatstreaming> yo having trouble donating is everything on your end?
[4:25:36] <YakumoYomi> So...Kabuto is Lelouch?
[4:25:37] <phatmac16> NINJA INFO CARDS
[4:25:37] <MarkUriah> Kabuto wants to be Orrochimaru
[4:25:38] <+TheDyingPride> He wants Ninja Info Cards
[4:25:40] <%rubbishbinge> He wants his mama
[4:25:41] <%ggbhtg> Kabuto's backstory was a story and a HALF
[4:25:42] <+knowyourenemy_97> meh
[4:25:43] <%Superbro64> He was helping out Pain with his initial goals right? @WoolieVersus
[4:25:43] <NiktenKing> Also do remember that Danzo was actively trying to extinguish Shisui's attempts to peace, which eventually led to his death and Itachi being the scourge
[4:25:44] <SaltyDongs> bitches
[4:25:45] <%ECRead> LUL
[4:25:46] <%lotharrio> Uhhh... he was uhh... wanted to be cooler than Orochimaru?
[4:25:48] <C4m3r0n0409> NINJA CARDS
[4:25:50] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I forget, are Orochimaru and Kabuto related to the end boss at all or no?
[4:25:52] <phatmac16> MY NINJA INFO CARDS
[4:25:52] <RetroCop87> WHAT THE HECK ARE THOSE?
[4:25:53] <%ggbhtg> my Ninja Info Cards dot mp3
[4:25:53] <%SuperKirby24> his "N"-card LUL
[4:25:53] <C4m3r0n0409> I FORGOT ABOUT THOSE
[4:25:53] <%Kriss1827> kabuto wanted an identity
[4:25:54] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Unlike Obito wanting to be no one, Kabuto wanted to be someone.
[4:25:56] <%bread_assassin> Sucks that the game skipped pretty much all of Kabuto's backstory.
[4:25:56] <+Ether101_Prime> Revenge for his mother.
[4:25:56] <biomegabear> ninja info card was his deifning moment
[4:25:56] <%Superbro64> and then Pain ended up being a puppet for obito, who was a puppet for madara
[4:26:02] <Twin_Hallow> @Reverend_Roscoe nah
[4:26:02] <+SilverInferno3> @Reverend_Roscoe No
[4:26:03] <+AXL808> i feel like Kabuto could just do shit on his own without ninja war shit and he would've been fine
[4:26:03] <+chase959> Kabuto got sensei cucked by danzo
[4:26:06] <BlackermanZX> he needed the SSS EX Minato card
[4:26:06] <biomegabear> @C4m3r0n0409 thank you

[4:34:04] <YakumoYomi> Hit the lever!
[4:34:13] <Arek_1> Yeah, Storm 4 glossed over how dangerous the Truth-Seeking Balls were. Made of all 5 elements, disintegrates like Dust Release, and if Yin-Yang Release is applied to them, they negate all ninjutsu. That last point works even on Edo Tensei, so the Edo zombies wouldn't regenerate. Only weakness is natural energy (Sage Mode, Curse Mark).
