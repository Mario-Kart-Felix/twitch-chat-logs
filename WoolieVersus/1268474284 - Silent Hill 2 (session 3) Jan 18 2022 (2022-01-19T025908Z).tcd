[0:05:59] <%glaciomaniak> @shad0wtag cause it's pretty damn good game (story aside) and takes like 3 hours to beat
[0:05:59] <%ChoculaUltra> Spyro and Kazooie game would SLAP.
[0:06:02] <TheyCallMeVawn> Leaving with a 400 million dollar pay out
[0:06:09] <leith_aziz> Is this good news? I cant help but feel neutral

[0:10:09] <Darren716> MS got a hell of a deal thanks to the controversies, I saw it estimated that they paid $25 billion less than if it was 6 months ago
[0:10:10] <+LastHazzerd> you can either hate or create
[0:10:11] <+Shonen_hero> does anyone remember Rare?
[0:10:17] <leith_aziz> @MyNameIsRasus That's mobile games. Doesnt harm me anymore pickySad
[0:10:17] <@Menitta> They did it with Bungie, Rare, Bethesda, and now fucking Activision
[0:10:19] <%Shad0wTag> @MyNameIsRasus Almost everything has made more than any fighting game
[0:10:21] <+LastHazzerd> Kappa
[0:10:22] <bippityjones> Master Chief, the Apple gaming mascot
[0:10:23] <%Javaa01> @sporeian94 It's already a default app in Win10, always has been
[0:10:29] <%glaciomaniak> good thing cods dieing
[0:10:31] <Scrapl> microsoft is kinda scary
[0:10:35] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta Hey Bungie left and Microsoft made 343 to replace it
[0:10:36] <peachy996> Good thing I don't want any of what Activision or Bethesda have to offer nowadays
[0:10:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> @Shad0wTag that's fair
[0:10:41] <@Menitta> Don't make thing better, make other thing worse.
[0:10:43] <$ArCielArDor> Microsoft purchases rape company
[0:10:51] <%ChoculaUltra> if Sony could buy out Konami tho....
[0:10:54] <+Shonen_hero> or the unionizing
[0:10:57] <leith_aziz> Hopefully that doesnt get swept under teh rug
[0:10:57] <+AlecBaldwinsTriggaFinger> As long as it isn’t FromSoft, I don’t really care.
[0:11:03] <derap41> fuck all
[0:11:04] <leith_aziz> cohhSus cohhSus cohhSus cohhSus cohhSus cohhSus
[0:11:08] <%baka_sugoi> VIDEO GAMES ARE BAD
[0:11:11] <jorniev> fuck
[0:11:13] <mortificent> YEAP
[0:11:14] <seboyo2> @ChoculaUltra God please make Sony buy Konami or at least its franchise
[0:11:16] <%molens1990> Master Chief vs Price vs Doom Guy
[0:11:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> buying Konami wouldn't make sense cause they're not a video game company anymore lol
[0:11:21] <tigerfang86> huge disruption of actual progress
[0:11:22] <+Shonen_hero> this is going to cause panic buying from other major conglomerates
[0:11:25] <+Lord0Mugen> @Menitta The Stampers were trying to sell out and retire and Nintendo didnt bite. Almost similar to Bioware although the Dr.s wanted in on the CEO table on that.
[0:11:25] <%Kriss1827> yeah and thats fucked
[0:11:33] <+LastHazzerd> Microsoft bought fucking Zenimax
[0:11:33] <+mechslayer71> GOOD LUCK OMEGALUL
[0:11:35] <Darren716> I mean now Acti Blizz actually has someone over them
[0:11:38] <CatRidder> the workers that try to unionize will get sack
[0:11:40] <slackerunchained> "Here
[0:11:44] <%JoshManVGH> UnionBusting at ActiBlizzion just got super install...
[0:11:49] <leith_aziz> Any way this turns, employees gonna get stressed from all the coverage
[0:11:49] <%RyTYoung> woolieGLORY for the streich today? kappa
[0:11:49] <%ChoculaUltra> Konami still owns the video game IPs that they've owned tho - regardless if they're still a video game company or not lol. That's a bad argument
[0:11:51] <%X2Eliah> True, but microsoft doesn't have a massively known figurehead
[0:11:51] <BopBeep> If you thought Acti blizzard had lawyers, Microsoft got lawyers
[0:11:51] <mortificent> nah, Microsoft union bust even harder, don't they?
[0:11:52] <BlackermanZX> kotick is just a psycho
[0:11:53] <sporeian94> I too like to look at garbage fires and ask "How can this benefit me!"
[0:11:54] <derap41> Microsoft could dump every dev and just keep the IP
[0:11:54] <%RyTYoung> Kappa *
[0:11:55] <+DatAsuna> @abelincoln_catpuncher Yeah they're just sitting on a bunch of IP that will never be for sale.
[0:11:58] <@Solidus_113> he wrote those letters
[0:12:02] <leith_aziz> Well, Andrew Wilson exists
[0:12:05] <slackerunchained> *"Here's a padlock for your breast-milk refrigerator."
[0:12:15] <%molens1990> So when is Microsoft Smash?
[0:12:18] <valriot> Phil Spencer at least, is a good guy and the man in charge so there is that
[0:12:18] <+JustToWatch> Doc had a good thread about how this is likely the only way to actually get Kotick out
[0:12:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> It is funny that the "evil companies because bad game practices" turns out to be actually fucking evil in the end, huh?
[0:12:27] <derap41> Holy Shit they're making a Cuphead Show
[0:12:29] <+the_schmendrick> he's going to get richer from leaving. unless he's broke, in jail, and/or dead, i'm not gonna be happy
[0:12:30] <%Shad0wTag> @ChoculaUltra Konami is more than a video game company, like wiki their stuff they are just a corp that handles stuff. From medical supplies, housing, gambling ect.
[0:12:31] <+Jiggisnipe> man Xbox Game Studios list of studios is crazy lol
[0:12:35] <joshujostar> this all seems like damage control for acti blizz
[0:12:42] <leith_aziz> Funny how EA's been silent all this time
[0:12:42] <specracer29> it's insane to imagine division as being under another company as not being publisher and developer but just another developer under a umbrella
[0:12:47] <%ChoculaUltra> if Konami WANTED to sell their video game IPs they would've done it years ago. They know they're sitting on gold but know they can get away with their gyms and pachinko parlors because its less work
[0:12:52] <leith_aziz> We better not forget about them
[0:12:56] <%RyTYoung> Microsoft really weren’t kidding when they said their relationship would be changing with Acti/Blizz Kappa
[0:13:08] <+Shonen_hero> god if Microsoft bought EA
[0:13:09] <sporeian94> I'm all about the 3 B's. Blizzard, Bethesda, and Bioware... 1 to go...
[0:13:09] <+DatAsuna> The MS CEO Satya Nadella just did a public statement about Bobby and just said "he's done great work building activision over the years and growing it's value",polishing him up and sidestepping the shit
[0:13:10] <jetpack_rorschasch> What a wonderful world we're all in! CurseLit NotLikeThis CurseLit
[0:13:10] <+Shonen_hero> that's it
[0:13:11] <specracer29> @rytyoung lol
[0:13:11] <+Shonen_hero> we're done
[0:13:16] <%ChoculaUltra> hence why we're seeing fucking Castlevania NFTs and not new Castlevania games.
[0:13:25] <%Shad0wTag> @RyTYoung nailed it I forgot about that statement
[0:13:25] <leith_aziz> @Shonen_hero That sounds more bad than good
[0:13:30] <+セビー> NotLikeThis
[0:13:35] <jett_eyes> what happened last time they played? I remember them getting to the hotel, but I feel like I missed a stream.
[0:13:35] <%Prevot> Microsoft really put the value in reevaluating their relationship with Activision
[0:13:38] <+Shonen_hero> it isn't supposed to sound good
[0:13:40] <%RyTYoung> Super hypocritical
[0:13:46] <%molens1990> So there is still time for Sony to walk in with a bigger pile of cash?
[0:13:49] <+DatAsuna> We can only hope Phil Spencer pushes him out a window into that golden parachute
[0:13:55] <%ChoculaUltra> not even the success of the Netflix Castlevania show budged Konami to do something with the IP FeelsBadMan
[0:13:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> In his head he is Kira in the helicopter

[0:14:47] <+Kyma1020> hopefully walks away and instead of the sunset, it's a prosecuting team for being in Epstein's club
[0:14:52] <%ChoculaUltra> @ArCielArDor legit one of those funniest threads on twitter from this weekend LUL
[0:14:56] <leith_aziz> Geez, Activision, Ubisoft, NFTS and the companies involved...
[0:15:00] <+Mkingston> He'll get called into his own Silent hill.
[0:15:04] <Nabs96> Phil Spencer may have saved xbox but he was still a snake in the grass
[0:15:05] <leith_aziz> Gaming has been a trashfire this whole month
[0:15:06] <+SpinalWizard> Heads. On. Pikes.
[0:15:09] <leith_aziz> pickyPalm pickyPalm pickyPalm
[0:15:26] <%X2Eliah> Speaking of companies and nft stupidity.... don't forget, Norton Antivirus is a crypot miner now.
[0:15:27] <slackerunchained> "The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must."
[0:15:36] <Nabs96> @leith_aziz not just this month tbh. the industry has always been shit
[0:15:38] <%RyTYoung> An Artful Escape one might say Kappa
[0:15:39] <%Shad0wTag> Robert Kotick: "See I told you I would turn this company around!"  -runs away with a shit on of giga money-
[0:15:42] <%molens1990> @specracer29 so wait what if Sony buys Square, and Amazon buys EA?
[0:15:48] <+Shonen_hero> hopefully walks away into the sun. Just into the giant burning mass
[0:15:50] <$ArCielArDor> @choculaultra like lil Wayne thinking he owned sega
[0:15:54] <leith_aziz> @Nabs96 Well, now it smells stincher
[0:15:54] <sporeian94> I mean as far as I know microsoft doesn't have any big HR scandals like that
[0:15:55] <%Shad0wTag> @molens1990 Sony will never spend that kinda money
[0:15:58] <@Menitta> I don't understand the process for the ongoing lawsuits. People say they mean nothing but Id like to understand why.
[0:15:59] <%baka_sugoi> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:16:09] <roz_en> for comparison, nintendo is worth 61 bil
[0:16:16] <%D4C_Trice> all the more reason to unionise
[0:16:18] <roz_en> usd
[0:16:21] <leith_aziz> @Menitta Dealing with lawyers I assume?
[0:16:25] <+LastHazzerd> Bobby: "Nope, i'm leaving with more money."
[0:16:27] <mortificent> and he whispered "NO"
[0:16:28] <%Shad0wTag> The floor is human rights and proper working standards
[0:16:32] <Nabs96> @leith_aziz Agreed. Whatever way this acquisition ends, we are the ones who are gonna lose.
[0:16:33] <%baka_sugoi> YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD
[0:16:34] <%Shad0wTag> Bobby Kotick JUMPING
[0:16:35] <%ChoculaUltra> @Menitta they don't actually go into the hearing stage until much later iirc - so any outside discourse before the hearings start is just discourse
[0:16:36] <+LastHazzerd> God that man is so frustrating
[0:16:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> Jumps off the side of the building, but gets caught by a big Halo Pelican that lifts him up and flies off
[0:16:47] <%MyNameIsRasus> he can
[0:16:47] <+Shonen_hero> LUL
[0:16:49] <%X2Eliah> He can. He has.
[0:16:50] <leith_aziz> pickyOof pickyOof pickyOof pickyOof pickyOof
[0:16:52] <+TheCityBeast> "A cornered Bobby is more dangerous than a union!"
[0:16:54] <+Shonen_hero> he absolutely can
[0:16:54] <%Lion_kun> He can get Epsteined
[0:16:55] <roz_en> he played the game and won harder than anyone ever could
[0:16:56] <NotHereToStream> literally "screw the rules i have money"
[0:16:57] <+DatAsuna> @Menitta I think the general expectation is just that they'll settle out of court, pay them money and take no action
[0:16:57] <Majestic_Flof> this is the loss
[0:16:57] <brunoberserk> LUL LUL LUL
[0:16:57] <+Lord0Mugen> he won A LOOOOOOOONG time ago
[0:16:57] <+LastHazzerd> how does a man who cares only about power and money lose?
[0:16:59] <%X2Eliah> This is laready it. He won.
[0:17:00] <TheyCallMeVawn> Can he just get hit by a car
[0:17:02] <%JoshManVGH> Oh Reggie, corpos never lose.
[0:17:03] <yngvez> STAY WINNING BOBBY EZ
[0:17:04] <wotan316> getting epsteined LUL
[0:17:04] <VincentGraves> he will die at some point
[0:17:05] <%ChoculaUltra> so that's probably why people are saying whatever is going on now has no weight on the shit that's been happening with ActiBlizz - just a hunch, not 100%
[0:17:05] <DelgotHansto> He will lose in the revolution comrades
[0:17:10] <Nabs96> socialist revolution when? I'm sharpening the guillotines boys
[0:17:10] <mortificent> the only thing there is, is the Epstein stuff
[0:17:11] <%Shad0wTag> Can we just get confirmation on something Bobby being in bed with Epstein and that will actually be an L he will have to hold
[0:17:16] <+Mkingston> "Do what you must. I've already won!" woolieEVIL woolieEVIL woolieEVIL
[0:17:26] <Nabs96> PAY TO WIN?
[0:17:30] <%MyNameIsRasus> He has already done it 32 minutes ago
[0:17:30] <+Breaknoon> money cured AIDS
[0:17:31] <+tempestzephyr> pokemon money
[0:17:33] <Eger007> the transaction will conclude in 2023
[0:17:33] <topiodonk> aint he involved with coca cola?
[0:17:33] <+Shonen_hero> literally the only way he can go down is in a massive stinger op
[0:17:34] <%X2Eliah> Nah, get paid to win
[0:17:34] <Majestic_Flof> bill gates microsoft kinda money
[0:17:36] <+kraajkase> Light bends around him.
[0:17:37] <bippityjones> You can always lose if [redacted]
[0:17:38] <%notmicrowavesafe> Bobby screaming: "YOU DIDN'T WIN, YOU DIDN'T WIN!"
[0:17:39] <%Lion_kun> Money won't save you from an inevitable death.
[0:17:39] <derap41> He Has that Fuck You money
[0:17:41] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Are they talking about gambling?
[0:17:41] <nyacoo> If he ever ended up in Silent Hill he'd still be able to get away
[0:17:42] <leith_aziz> The true loss is that we didnt do anything beyond the controversy. All that happened was that a bigger conglomorate bought a smaller one, which made Bobby quit
[0:17:42] <Tracazoid> Pay to win at life, just pay the poors to ignore you
[0:17:43] <crackedhappiness> HE Could take like 1/2 of the US Det and fill it
[0:17:43] <Treasure_Vault> I dunno, you can still slip off your yacht. No one is invincible.
[0:17:44] <mortificent> @Shad0wTag We would need Ghislane Maxwell to spill the beans
[0:17:56] <peachy996> Have you ever heard of "Fuck you money"?
[0:18:00] <+Stormzcales_Lair> sucks but true, gotta know how to play the game.
[0:18:02] <%Shad0wTag> @Shad0wTag Was he ever mentioned in the black boob?
[0:18:02] <leith_aziz> The strikes and lawsuits just get shelved in the sidelines

[0:19:42] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus Its funny how Microsoft public perception has been good for the last 5 or so years and doing this is gonna get them bad press by association
[0:19:43] <+Lord0Mugen> or is everybody gone and nothing but a husk remains?

[0:19:59] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda scared of what this move is going to force the rest of the industry to do
[0:20:00] <peachy996> Let's get back to happier times, like Silent Hill 2!
[0:20:03] <%D4C_Trice> so there's reports that Bobby Kotic will still work at actiblizz but Phil Spencer will be his boss
[0:20:07] <+DatAsuna> Do go in depth later, but you're mostly on track
[0:20:08] <marvel877> Research will ruin the podcast/stream.
[0:20:09] <%ChoculaUltra> like Sony acquires Capcom or some crazy shit

[0:21:32] <velgaduere> wuzzat
[0:21:38] <+samuraiknack> Reggie looked a little concerned when that name was read
[0:21:40] <%Deekman> Yeah it’s great
[0:21:41] <+Undenizen> certain games are really geared towards a driver and a backseat.
[0:21:42] <%SouLucha> Oooh?! woolieLORE

[0:21:48] <%X2Eliah> The silent lurker fanbase of the silent hill
[0:21:52] <majindusto> enigmaS
[0:21:52] <@Menitta> Like me I've never heard of this Woolie Versus channel
[0:21:52] <Fabpsi_> survival horror is a very interesting videogame-eye-catcher for a lot of people, yea
[0:21:54] <+DatAsuna> New genres new audiences
[0:21:54] <GARahn> how are you guys liking SH2 so far?
[0:21:54] <%KellBeII> it does have a specific community
[0:21:57] <slackerunchained> Next try out Eternal Darkness, guys. :)
[0:21:59] <Nabs96> Survival horror is fun @woolieversus and I like u guys so win win.
[0:22:01] <+kewlmyc> People love watching people get scared, or in this case, see a good story
[0:22:04] <shieldecho> I did get into the old channel through their Machinima Shattered Memories vid and the Downpour LP so that honestly tracks
[0:22:05] <leith_aziz> I discovered you by checking out soem of the stuff you decided to play
[0:22:05] <AngryAsian5> Yeah, this new survival horror arc is fun
[0:22:05] <Hoaxfish> "give me eyes" on survival horror
[0:22:08] <+LastHazzerd> i thought that was Kirby Kappa
[0:22:10] <%molens1990> Woolie finally finishes RE2
[0:22:12] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[0:22:17] <%Kriss1827> @menitta i thought this was csb D:
[0:22:17] <peachy996> It started with RE2 and Downpour
[0:22:19] <+DatAsuna> Survival horror is especially suited to viewership
[0:22:21] <leith_aziz> Guilty Gear, Batman Arkham, DMC..
[0:22:21] <kes009900> people love seeing those GUH HUHs
[0:22:22] <%hereiam407> Kirby was the original survival horror
[0:22:23] <%ChoculaUltra> playing survival horror alone = too spoopy for me. Watching the boys play survival horror while chat laughs at them? Wholesome.
[0:22:23] <+Kyma1020> Shitstorm
[0:22:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> Apparently, Twitch lets you follow specific games so you can get alerted if ANYONE streams them
[0:22:25] <+Shonen_hero> then to fighting games eventually
[0:22:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> Survival Horror peaked with Bloodborne. I will not elaborate
[0:22:30] <Tracazoid> Can confirm, as a horror gaming fan I came into SBF through the horror games and the Shitstorm
[0:22:31] <jetpack_rorschasch> The old SBF fans are still around, but we just lurk more than we used to. SeemsGood
[0:22:31] <chrono_dh> im here cuz i just finished disco elysium, and saw your guys videos - they were awesome, and i think ill be here for a while
[0:22:33] <+Jiggisnipe> SH2 was the 1st playthrough?

[0:22:38] <@Menitta> the 2nd video was Shattered Memories and the first LP was RE2

[0:29:03] <slackerunchained> It was foretold by GYROMANCY! ...And cynical capitlist business practices. :P
[0:29:04] <johnthegg> @leith_aziz yeah he's horrible but the entire culture of the executives at that company are awful

[0:29:20] <%Double_Tap_That> Bobby "Friend of Epstein" Kotick
[0:29:21] <%ChoculaUltra> maybe even earlier
[0:29:29] <crackedhappiness> and this is only 18 days into 2022
[0:29:32] <jett_eyes> How far will you GO
[0:29:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> @BlackermanZX First level: "Women IS object"
[0:29:37] <+Kittilot> gamefreak devs need to unionize fr
[0:29:37] <iswearimjustdandy> @leith_aziz well hes the toxic man who gets to hire all the other toxic men and keep them in power sooo
[0:29:38] <%hereiam407> Send Bobby Kotick to Silent Hill already
[0:29:40] <+Mkingston> Weinstein level
[0:29:41] <%ChoculaUltra> 18 days!? Oh god it really is still January
[0:29:43] <depressioncherrie> The only way this could escalate further is if, after leaving Microsoft/Activision, Kotick somehow becomes the CEO of Tencent
[0:29:46] <BlackermanZX> @MyNameIsRasus LUL
[0:29:55] <%ChoculaUltra> Tomorrow Sony is gonna announce they bought out Square-Enix or some shit.
[0:30:03] <+Jiggisnipe> it made the stock pop ~$20
[0:30:15] <leith_aziz> Upcoming News: Bobby announces he'll work for EA D:
[0:30:23] <leith_aziz> (tis a joke)
[0:30:38] <Nabs96> RESET THE CLOCK: REQUIEM
[0:30:38] <+birddotexe> GOOD, it deserves to be made public
[0:30:39] <%ThePich> @Kittilot union is japan are even deader than in the US
[0:30:40] <+MindWebby> So who's Microsoft buying next? Rockstar, Paradox, or EA
[0:30:51] <Trecrimson> Bobby Kotick announced as the new CEO of Fromsoft
[0:30:51] <+Shonen_hero> it's a 60 billion dollar acquisition. It's right up there with the Disney Fox merger
[0:30:52] <%MajorCrasher> Sony's too broke to buy any major studios tbh
[0:30:54] <Nabs96> YOU WILL NEVER REACH THE END
[0:30:54] <+Ancopro> where's the part where kiryu beats up kotik and he learns his lessson
[0:30:55] <+Jiggisnipe> from $65 to like $85 and
[0:30:56] <+5secondnut> hey folks
[0:30:59] <leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra That doesnt sound far fetched ngl
[0:31:00] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus the unsung tragedy of this is the further consolidation of properties, similar to the Disney Empire but for video games
[0:31:01] <%ZweihanderSteve> substories, minus the yakuza high jinks
[0:31:04] <%Shad0wTag> @MindWebby Honestly surprised they didn't buy Sega already with how in bed with them they are
[0:31:08] <johnthegg> @MajorCrasher pretty much everyone besides apple are too broke to compete with microsoft
[0:31:09] <+Kittilot> @thepich oh im well aware. a man can dream tho
[0:31:10] <+Jiggisnipe> of course the #1 largest U.S publisher just bought the #2
[0:31:14] <+Cadwae> @WoolieVersus I work for the lawfirm that handles Blizzard's stuff. Going to be a busy year of paperwork.
[0:31:23] <Arkkraken> hey guys
[0:31:27] <leith_aziz> @Kittilot Japan's culture has people not really call other workers out, so unionising seems impossible
[0:31:31] <+birddotexe> reggie is premium dlc, locked behind an ad
[0:31:42] <+5secondnut> That's sexy
[0:31:44] <leith_aziz> If you start critiscising, your coworkers'll stand against you
[0:31:47] <+Bosni9> I've recommended Artesian to three friends successfully @WoolieVersus

[0:54:20] <Fabpsi_> normally you need a gun pointing at someone else for a free grave - and even then they are normally just digging their own grave and not yours.... i..mean..so i have heard...
[0:54:22] <shieldecho> @Aussie_Manny Joseph always going on about how things can't be possible when he saw a vampire god turn his hand into a demon squirrel that tore through a couple of Nazis
[0:54:23] <Scrapl> snow white
[0:54:24] <%Onorekian> This puzzle is sponsored by Disney
[0:54:28] <majindusto> lol
[0:54:28] <OblivionSword1> music box puzzle
[0:54:35] <+ItsSunderland> smh Disney really is everywhere these days
[0:54:37] <thomasvalentine31> I know who I am
[0:54:38] <sporeian94> I forget is it 3 where if you do the hard puzzle difficulty there's like a shakespeare puzzle that requires like a BA in Literature to solve
[0:54:38] <+Undenizen> you know, this puzzle would SUCK for people who don't know western fairy tales.
[0:54:44] <%dds333a> @aussie_manny well, that didn't happen LUL
[0:54:52] <+Byr0nX> 3 different pieces, and they all go into the square hole lol
[0:54:54] <Bubsla> Disney stole from silent hill
[0:54:55] <%livlinn> Oof LUL
[0:54:56] <Fabpsi_> disney gonna buy silent hill and make a theme park ride out of it?  Hell yea
[0:54:57] <csterra11> hopefully Elsa is here Kappa
[0:55:02] <linSP> do calculus
[0:55:04] <Skaab_Ruinator> @Undenizen I mean the puzzle is in a Japanese game so clearly they expected Japanese players to easily figure this out
[0:55:07] <+healnavi> Where's mickey
[0:55:14] <DSD24> That sounds bad
[0:55:15] <Scrapl> make maria a disney princess!

[0:55:29] <majindusto> enigmaHmm
[0:55:32] <Camo_boy67> Japan likes western fairy tales, so they should be fine.
[0:55:33] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Living in silent hill must be such a pain in the ass, imagine you leave your house to go get some bread or some shit and on the way you have to solve 3 cryptic puzzless while carrying 16 key items you found in a dumpster for later
[0:55:40] <MsYakumo> Gather the princesses of light to open the door to darkness.
[0:55:55] <thomasvalentine31> @ANGRA_MAlNYU while your on the Hardest Difficulty setting for Puzzles
[0:55:57] <Aussie_Manny> Yes, that's the story.

[0:56:21] <%hystericalwoman> original little mermaid was indeed fucked up

[0:56:35] <DSD24> Oh man its leg day in this room
[0:56:42] <%Shad0wTag> Hans Christenson did NOT write happy stories

[0:57:13] <%Shad0wTag> @Camo_boy67 Yup she becomes see foam

[0:58:32] <%crybirb> @dukenux it's kinda implied witches are not really human so it's not cannibalism, it's like demons eating people
[0:58:34] <%Indigo_Automaton> SH2 Pipe vs HL Crowbar whow wins?
[0:58:46] <Melchior_the_Wise> the bullets were the friends we made along the way.
[0:58:46] <Aussie_Manny> woolieEVIL HAHAHA
[0:58:47] <mortificent> Hansel and Gretel burnin the witch  in her own oven always rocked

[0:58:57] <Fabpsi_> hl crowbar, you can even see it in woolies outro - no chance against that
[0:58:57] <dinnydanny777> Toilet paper :O
[0:59:00] <%hereiam407> Scrape the floors
[0:59:02] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Save those shotgun shells for ghost children
[0:59:02] <Scrapl> @dukenux even better, demons get what's coming to them lol

[0:59:07] <Melchior_the_Wise> hl2 crowbar
[0:59:13] <Aussie_Manny> Look under your shoe.

[0:59:21] <peachy996> now watch him not be fine
[0:59:21] <Bubsla> you have to hold it in
[0:59:22] <Camo_boy67> Screw those ghost kids.
[0:59:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> but it really should be crowbar vs big knife
[0:59:34] <+xenoboost> that's super man vs joe schmoe levels of comparison
[0:59:46] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yeah but that pipe's probably a cursed object now. The crowbar is just a crowbar, and it's only powerful because of the HEV suit's power
[0:59:49] <+セビー> big knife? ive seen bigger
[1:00:18] <Bubsla> lol
[1:00:19] <%CoffeeSlice> da,m

[1:00:22] <Fabpsi_> yea, stick that pipe right in there!
[1:00:23] <+セビー> wait.. at what point does a knife get too big snd become a sword?
[1:00:25] <QueequegTheater> You need to attach a chainsaw to that pipe, like that one dude in Gears of War 2
[1:00:26] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> The pipe has become supernatural and able to kill apostles just by the sheer amount of monster James has murked with it
[1:00:27] <Camo_boy67> I’ll tell you fuck them kids and I can’t stress it enough.
[1:00:28] <w_khan> good pipe

[1:05:42] <DSD24> @Aussie_Manny Or Suffer the Curse?
[1:05:46] <mortificent> @Skaab_Ruinator nah, it's more of a localized thing, in Europe it's definitely a slur
[1:05:49] <%ThePich> shi'ts locked
[1:05:51] <Aussie_Manny> @DSD24 Correct.
[1:05:54] <iswearimjustdandy> @skaab_ruinator just because it is reclaimed by some doesnt mean non rmoni people should say it is the thing,
[1:05:57] <%hereiam407> It’s all locks, all the way down
[1:05:58] <DelgotHansto> Amazing shadows for a PS2 game, on par with stuff even today
[1:06:06] <Skaab_Ruinator> @mortificent its definitely not, and Europe is the only place where that group of people even lives far as I know
[1:06:07] <marshalmorphino22> Broken locks are forever sealed, lost to the world
[1:06:09] <%hystericalwoman> what if we just don't use words that literally anyone has told us is a slur, lol
[1:06:09] <+セビー> shits locked,
[1:06:13] <%Javaa01> Yeah the lock being functional means it's meant to be operated at some point
[1:06:13] <Bubsla> we only have the employee map

[1:06:27] <DSD24> James would be bad in a 3D fighting
[1:06:29] <%robosqueeb> @hystericalwoman the word cheese is a slur

[2:37:27] <dukenux> Shining Island
[2:37:28] <+ItsSunderland> Time to play with the teleporting doors I guess
[2:37:28] <Aussie_Manny> Shutter Island was a good movie.
[2:37:29] <w_khan> great movie
[2:37:30] <jetstreamlove_R> Faith has cross path! DUEL 1! FIGHT!
[2:37:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Funny I just watched Shutter Island and went "Very Silent Hill 2 vibes
[2:37:33] <VincentGraves> pure melancholy
[2:37:33] <%Kungfuski> Calling your stepmom a bitch then running away only to find out she hot glued the window shut
[2:37:33] <nailwind> we were in the shitter ever since we spawned in the toilet
[2:37:37] <%HelveticaScenario> @itstreylar Thank you for the sub
[2:37:37] <+Undenizen> that movie was so.... a movie.
[2:37:38] <+illusiveSaint> this music made my heart sink as a kid

[2:37:49] <%RemedyofRevenge> James can't escape from crossing fate
[2:37:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Shutter Island was great
[2:37:50] <Nabs96> @canadiananimatorguy I watched it a month ago myself
[2:37:51] <%dds333a> That's why it's shocking that people have dodged this, because this is one of the biggest examples of this LUL
[2:37:51] <Aussie_Manny> Person with delusions: "NAH! NAH!"
[2:38:03] <DelgotHansto> Anything that starts with the protag looking into a mirror is an immediate red flag that the MC did some shit
[2:38:12] <%hereiam407> Btw, read 'Crime and Punishment' its a really good book, and was an inspiration to this game
[2:38:16] <+ultran122> I really liked Shutter Island, haven't watched The Lighthouse yet.
[2:38:19] <+Iamdenril> shutter island is such a goof film!

[2:45:12] <nailwind> FeelsBadMan silent hill with no music
[2:45:14] <Space_Pagan> uh oh
[2:45:15] <alikeran> oof
[2:45:16] <+croxeye> you have to exit all the way out
[2:45:18] <+HeroSolaire> Reboot game
[2:45:18] <%HelveticaScenario> Exit the game to desktop
[2:45:21] <Nero270> I don't think there is music here
[2:45:21] <superbla25> reboot
[2:45:22] <dashwallkick> close game, restart
[2:45:26] <dashwallkick> but also I think it's silent here
[2:45:27] <Skaab_Ruinator> restarting game usually works in issues like this, not "nothing I can do" LUL
[2:45:28] <peachy996> Well RIP if it doesn't trigger
[2:45:28] <NireFuster> Close the game
[2:45:29] <BlackLabud> Perhaps reload from the VCR room
[2:45:30] <%hereiam407> I don't think there's music here
[2:45:32] <bleugh> nothing he can do :)
[2:45:35] <BlackLabud> Right before it bugged out
[2:45:36] <%Kriss1827> close game maybe?
[2:45:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:45:39] <Bubsla> I think you have to reboot it to fix it
[2:45:40] <+ItsSunderland> I dont think there is supposed to be music here.
[2:45:40] <%townzzzzz> you're good for now
[2:45:41] <OblivionSword1> chat which one is it ?
[2:45:41] <Fuji808> Exit to desktop, restart
[2:45:42] <+kraajkase> It's fine
[2:45:42] <Supwizy> Could be a silent part
[2:45:42] <+HalloKeyori111> :)
[2:45:43] <majindusto> No music  here
[2:45:44] <Aussie_Manny> is there supposed to be music?
[2:45:44] <depressioncherrie> Isn't there a cutscene soon? Music should kick back in then, no?
[2:45:46] <%SynclairPrime> not this trigger, the next trigger
[2:45:46] <%BreadLM> hard reset pls
[2:45:47] <marshalmorphino22> I think it’s quiet here
[2:45:48] <thomasvalentine31> exit out fully then back in
[2:45:49] <Skaab_Ruinator> @Aussie_Manny yes
[2:45:51] <%HelveticaScenario> Exit to desktop
[2:45:51] <dinnydanny777> NotLikeThis
[2:45:53] <+ItsSunderland> This part is silent, no music
[2:45:55] <+Undenizen> it's not called NOISY HILL
[2:45:55] <+セビー> csbeastKoopy
[2:45:55] <BlackLabud> There is music here,
[2:45:58] <BlackLabud> People are wrong
[2:45:58] <Aussie_Manny> Then Woolie should reboot.
[2:46:00] <NireFuster> It's fine don't worry about it
[2:46:00] <nailwind> reboot would be a safe bet
[2:46:00] <%Javaa01> The music isn't tied to the save
[2:46:01] <%G_Thunders> The music will kick back in
[2:46:02] <%BreadLM> I'm pretty sure the audio is just broken
[2:46:03] <+セビー> csbeastSnip csbeastSnip csbeastSnip csbeastSnip
[2:46:03] <dashwallkick> I think the basement is fine
[2:46:05] <%DoktorZee> theres no music
[2:46:07] <+UncleMcgoo> Ah man hope the whole game isn't fucked
[2:46:08] <+SolGainer> Just get to the next part, if the music is still gone, hard reset
[2:46:09] <peachy996> We'll see when it's bugged
[2:46:10] <Skaab_Ruinator> I mean why would you risk keeping the bug going. Whats the problem with restarting the game quickly?
[2:46:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can always count on chat to tell you two contradicting things LUL
[2:46:16] <TheeRabbi> did somebody say REBOOT????
[2:46:17] <DrkJP520> Maybe a load from a red square save will fix it
[2:46:19] <Ozzync> theres just no music now
[2:46:29] <BlackLabud> Yeah, try from here
[2:46:37] <NireFuster> Music! :)
[2:46:38] <+セビー> you’d think woolie would be all about a reboot
[2:46:38] <Aussie_Manny> phew

[2:53:01] <%dds333a> @darren716 he stated in the beginning that he knows elements of the games
[2:53:02] <Dr_Mooose> its ROUGH
[2:53:03] <azure_rivers> that's a heavy scene, and well acted
[2:53:04] <Tales911> "For me it's always like this.." Says every resident in California
[2:53:04] <w_khan> all her family were pieces of shit
[2:53:06] <sporeian94> This game would never get made today
[2:53:06] <majindusto> Angela  had a Rough Life :(
[2:53:07] <crudjandall> when people say the voice acting is bad, just show them this and the "Maria got bars" scene
[2:53:08] <Majestic_Flof> wheres a bottle of tequila
[2:53:08] <+ItsSunderland> Yeah like if James' Silent Hill is moldy and ruined and diseased, Angela's is on fire. Just like, constant pain and burning torment.

[2:53:27] <%Onorekian> Silent Hill is your therapy now
[2:53:30] <%Dabrikishaw> Angela is 100% a victim unlike James or Eddie, but she dies and there's nothing you can do about it.
[2:53:33] <+Mr_Pylon> ampoule can't solve anything
[2:53:34] <+AngelYoumou> And like was said before SHE'S NINETEEN
[2:53:34] <mortificent> monkaS
[2:53:38] <Bubsla> Don't look at it :O
[2:53:38] <dukenux> the worst part is that she seems   to entirely accepted it
[2:53:40] <Skaab_Ruinator> @sizzitysy he shortly entered her dimension of Silent Hill, which is like the fires of hell, basically. Also in the Eddie Boss fight he was in Eddies version of SH, cold and industrial (due to lifetime of bullying)
[2:53:40] <+Bitscreed> Moments like that are why SH2 still holds up.
[2:53:43] <%RemedyofRevenge> Angela has some crazy heat moves in Yakuza tho
[2:53:43] <jenji919> Silent hill is maxed out on emotional DPS

[2:55:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> one more try tho
[2:55:06] <NireFuster> If you keep trying to save her you'll just hurt yourself
[2:55:06] <csterra11> she's gone man
[2:55:08] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> shoot her in the back of the head like a hero
[2:55:08] <Nabs96> @peachy996 that's rhe worst part. I and many others feel Angela is innocent, but she feels that guilt. does that mean other people who were justified but feel some sort of guilt regardless, will be punished by silent Hill? that means silent Hill is an evil place. so what's up w this place? do we ever find out who created it?
[2:55:08] <%hereiam407> She's gone

[2:55:56] <Bubsla> uh oh
[2:55:58] <QueequegTheater> I know it's just a video game, but it speaks very well to both Woolie and Reggie's character that they tried to save her anyway
[2:55:58] <+brokensaint1982> they actually acted these scenes out before doing voicelines so the VA could try to understand what their characters were going through
[2:55:59] <Aussie_Manny> wtf
[2:55:59] <%livlinn> aarong9Fire psaWhat
[2:56:01] <marshalmorphino22> I sure hope it doesn’t get any worse for James
[2:56:01] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> there is no good endings in silent hill
[2:56:09] <+AngelYoumou> Fun Fact: In early drafts, Angela was actually supposed to be like 16~17
[2:56:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:56:12] <NireFuster> @ANGRA_MAlNYU Well...
[2:56:12] <crudjandall> @dds333a what? his voice acting is incredible, do you talk to a lot of wife smotherers trapped in alternate dimensions?
[2:56:12] <%LastHazzerd> just a bad time all around for her
[2:56:15] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Fog's back bois
[2:56:15] <Skaab_Ruinator> @dds333a well you dont get summoned to Silent Hill for being a victim, just for in general having personal demons
[2:56:15] <%dds333a> @nabs96 you don't want to know the answers to that shit
[2:56:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> FeelsBadMan
[2:56:17] <alikeran> what a garbage family she had
[2:56:19] <%superc37> @nabs96 ive always interpreted it as silent hill being a place that punishes guilt, or those who wish to be punished, regardless of whether you deserve it.
[2:56:27] <Aussie_Manny> "You see it too? For me, it's always like this."
[2:56:28] <+SolGainer> If Woolie gets anything besides a certain ending at this point I will be shocked
[2:56:29] <%hereiam407> Yeh, the map
[2:56:31] <%hereiam407> Good luck
[2:56:34] <%Javaa01> Only one way to go
[2:56:37] <mrtanaka111> silent hill is a beacon of suffering
[2:56:41] <crudjandall> "they talk weird, therefore bad voice acting"
[2:56:46] <linSP> Was that her brother on the wall
[2:56:50] <+ItsSunderland> Like how any mother could tell her own child that she deserved to have her father and brother abusing her is beyond evil
[2:56:50] <Fuji808> Fuck. I'm legit tearing up.
[2:56:52] <dukenux> I think Silent Hill works the same way Hell in The Sandman works, in this instance

[2:56:54] <shieldecho> Honestly the fact that they tried to go after her for longer than most kinda made my eyes water. These're some good people right here.
[2:56:56] <+LokimenD> depends if they wanna rip off SH2 or call back to 1 Kappa
[2:56:57] <BlackLabud> @superc37 Exactly. Regardless of whether or not it was warranted, she still killed her father.

[2:56:58] <Aussie_Manny> oh fuck
[2:57:00] <marshalmorphino22> You can read Angela’s profile in the manual too. She tried to run away after high school, but her dad dragged her back home…
[2:57:05] <Nabs96> @thomasvalentine31 I like the version of "it draws people in" better. very cosmic. But also leaves that hole in your heart.

[2:59:08] <kaidogs> will they
[2:59:08] <+brokensaint1982> more symbolism, there was only one square and now there are 9, its almost like James is finally coming to terms with what happened and has peiced together his fractured mind
[2:59:10] <+Reaverund> @superc37 I like to think that's its more than just people who did something bad, because that implies it has a moral compass. I like to think it's just people who feel guilty, as someone else said earlier, regardless of their innocence.
[2:59:10] <@Squdnate> Just a reminder chat. Just cuz we are this far into SH2, that doesn't mean that SH3 and games forward are open season for spoiling

[3:00:58] <crudjandall> @dds333a you're allowed to disagree with me, I personally believe that James' performance is not only amazing but also iconic. some people that haven't even played SH might still recognize exactly what character it's just from hearing a single line
[3:01:01] <GARahn> check for a save after the eddie fight
[3:01:03] <+king_of_mystery2> Check after Eddie
[3:01:06] <%DoktorZee> this is a fine time for him to explore that kinda stuff
[3:01:07] <%PunishedBuck> after Eddie dies
[3:01:14] <%Kriss1827> let the man satisfy his curiosity chat
[3:01:16] <$tkuwari> In my restless dreams I see Twitch Chat
[3:01:17] <Skaab_Ruinator> Rather, the letter was always a blank paper and James imagined it was an invitation from Mary. Silent Hills way of summoning him
[3:01:23] <%SynclairPrime> alright
[3:01:28] <+HeroSolaire> @crudjandall silent hill 2 acting is perfect, people have no idea what bad acting means
[3:01:30] <peachy996> @DSD24 Hm, I won't spoil it then. But it's possible the mother blamed Angela when she found out instead of her father
[3:01:32] <%dds333a> @crudjandall yeah, because of how stilted and awkward it sounds. I actually love it because of how bizarre it is LUL
[3:01:35] <Melchior_the_Wise> there's a great play through of SH2 with Guy Cihi providing commentary as he watches and its super insightful and gives some extra layers to the game
[3:01:38] <jorniev> gotta check those mechanics
[3:01:41] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus chat says after Eddie?
[3:01:46] <mortificent> so what ending so far, chat?
[3:01:50] <+SolGainer> check at the shipping dock
[3:01:50] <GARahn> shipping dock
[3:01:50] <TalisKanju> I think it's after you watch the TV?
[3:01:57] <NireFuster> @mortificent I guess we'll see
[3:01:58] <DSD24> @peachy996 Oof that sounds real
[3:02:00] <dashwallkick> it's before you arrive at the hotel
[3:02:01] <slackerunchained> @Skaab_Ruinator There's not even 'blank paper' now, tho...
[3:02:01] <Scrapl> @peachy996 I'll never understand why people do that
[3:02:04] <+healnavi> @mortificent it doesn't work that way
[3:02:09] <%crybirb> @peachy996 Totally plausible. In the small town of where my grandparents exist that actually happened, the wife blamed her child for the same thing.
[3:02:10] <+brokensaint1982> @skaab_ruinator CLOSE, very close
[3:02:10] <BlackLabud> Yeah, I wouldn't call the VA categorically good, it just happens to work. FFX is a game with actual good VA that gets shit on for having bad VA
[3:02:13] <Reilata> :)
[3:02:16] <NireFuster> Oh god THIS part LUL
[3:02:18] <+Casavilla458> I'm no expert but I would assume Maybe when you visit. Room on the third floor
[3:02:19] <crudjandall> I imagine someone in repressive denial of murdering the person they loved the most would sound a bit off
[3:02:19] <ElBuraindo> the letter goes as he realizes there can't be a letter
[3:02:19] <dukenux> nope
[3:02:23] <shieldecho> Damn that music though
[3:02:26] <+SolGainer> Shipping Dock save
[3:02:26] <dashwallkick> after! next one!
[3:02:28] <seboyo2> @crudjandall That's why guy cihi wasn't a voice actor, and also he was going through a very tough divorce so he sounds tired and sad practically all the time
[3:02:31] <%LastHazzerd> this OST is so good
[3:02:33] <DelgotHansto> The font slightly fades from the start, at the very start its clearer
[3:02:34] <alikeran> it's an incredible track
[3:02:36] <Skaab_Ruinator> @slackerunchained he has the letter from Mary in his inventory in the hotel but its a blank paper
[3:02:40] <NireFuster> BLANK
[3:02:40] <ElBuraindo> or more like accept what he did
[3:02:41] <dukenux> PogChamp

[3:02:47] <jorniev> my favorite track is the fire on the stairs

[3:02:48] <DSD24> I love the Bowling Alley song the most
[3:02:48] <Skaab_Ruinator> @brokensaint1982 its 100% it, what do you claim it is
[3:02:49] <kaidogs> :) hell yeah

[3:02:54] <karawra> wow
[3:02:54] <Deimos002> Thank you Silent Hill :)
[3:02:59] <%dds333a> @crudjandall one could say LUL
[3:03:03] <+HalloKeyori111> can you look at the empty envelope again?

[3:03:06] <puluxor> once you kill Eddie, you monster! asakuraWack
[3:03:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> right after killing eddie
[3:03:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> After he kills someone
[3:03:07] <peachy996> And that song is Fermata in Mystic Air I think
[3:03:09] <dinnydanny777> There was a letter and a hole here
[3:03:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1483311049713635328?s=20
[3:03:09] <%dds333a> @scrapl yeah it happens
[3:03:12] <dukenux> There was a letter here, it's gone now
[3:03:13] <JeoDood> once u take alife
[3:03:13] <DelgotHansto> The implication being, the feeling of killing someone awakens something in his subconcious
[3:03:13] <NireFuster> Super cool that the game allows you to do this though
[3:03:14] <BlackermanZX> and after killing someone
[3:03:16] <slackerunchained> @ElBuraindo "A Dead Person can't write a letter..."
[3:03:17] <%hereiam407> imposeadoor
[3:03:18] <+ItsSunderland> After he kills Eddie. So like the realization that he is CAPABLE of killing another human being is the catalyst
[3:03:20] <+bigslinglelino> thats a cool detail
[3:03:20] <lostallmyaccs> *Queue in old Woolie hole joke*
[3:03:25] <marshalmorphino22> A trip into your grave will mess with a man’s head
[3:03:27] <%Theycallmenerf> So James is nuts?
[3:03:33] <dukenux> @ItsSunderland
[3:03:36] <jenji919> After vanquishing fat evil
[3:03:39] <+セビー> doors with menacing auras
[3:03:39] <DSD24> Boss fight?
[3:03:40] <ghilbor> james never did go back up now that you mention it...

[3:03:48] <oak120> this song is incredible
[3:03:49] <%crybirb> @Theycallmenerf No, it's implied it's a personal hell, could be in his head dealing with the stuff or Silent Hill making him live all this.

[3:04:38] <seboyo2> @crudjandall The director never told Guy about the plot twist, so when he performed that scene he felt really bad and sad, but in a realistic way, not dramatized like a pro actor would've done
[3:04:40] <+Shonen_hero> spin spin spin
[3:04:42] <oak120> legit one of the best soundtracks in the franchise

[3:04:46] <dukenux> all James wanted is a domme relation
[3:04:46] <+ItsSunderland> Maria didn't ask to be hallucinated into reality!
[3:04:48] <crudjandall> Anybody else think James sounds like a south park character in that one moment? I can't ever not think about it

[3:06:41] <+brokensaint1982> @skaab_ruinator Nope, shes in the backseat. Americans do the trunk and this is decidedly a japanese game

[3:07:04] <+brokensaint1982> @skaab_ruinator and shes only been dead a week at the most
[3:07:08] <+Byr0nX> are you...doing damage?

[3:07:37] <nailwind> are you winning, James?
[3:07:38] <%KillinYaDreamz> is that a pokemon reference JK
[3:07:41] <%holydeviant1> The name of this OST track, by the by, is "Betrayal".
[3:07:43] <seboyo2> Some context about Maria, she is a real person that was created by the town and she just like Maria but sexier and more seductive, that's because she is the idealized version of Mary that james developed during her illness, she dies so many times to make James remember what he did to his wife
[3:07:44] <+SolidusRex> Two Pyramid Heads, two people James has killed
[3:07:46] <luftraumm1> isd that the seal of metatron on the ground?
[3:07:47] <dinnydanny777> James sure is resilient
[3:07:50] <thomasvalentine31> @DelgotHansto Basically: Pyramaid Head is willed into existence by James to punish him for the sin he committed. And Silent Hill responded to that.

[3:34:42] <+0neReeler> SingsNote
[3:34:42] <w_khan> They checked the knife too much
[3:34:42] <peachy996> This ending hits harder with Overdose Delusion. Leave hits harder with Promise
[3:34:43] <+ItsSunderland> Mary's letter is still some of the best voice acting ever, it STILL makes me cry
[3:34:44] <$RunningNGunning> Mary's VA CARRIED that letter
[3:34:44] <+Caped_Eggy> That letter was quite long LUL
[3:34:46] <+brokensaint1982> Mary's letter is THE most emotional thing in any game IMO

[3:35:17] <jorniev> NEVER GO TO SILENT HILL
[3:35:18] <+Shonen_hero> there's no telling you how you should or shouldn't interpret this
[3:35:20] <%crybirb> In this ending James doesn't listen to her wishes. There's one he adopts Laura and it's basically following her wishes.
[3:35:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Man whoever wrote this must've had it rooough
[3:35:23] <%hereiam407> LUL
[3:35:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> This song yeah LUL
[3:35:24] <%G_Thunders> I can’t believe Max got the better ending and he didn’t even care about the game until the halfway mark
[3:35:25] <+solzan2000> lol
[3:35:25] <+ItsSunderland> I really hope they talk about the other ending possibilities
[3:35:25] <NireFuster> @QueequegTheater There is no canon ending, the writers said so multiple times
[3:35:25] <%Onorekian> LUL
[3:35:25] <peachy996> It's too much
[3:35:25] <dukenux> @majindusto he got leave on first try??

[3:35:28] <Darren716> 2002 YEAH
[3:35:29] <Tunamanguy> its the bad ending song
[3:35:30] <+bigslinglelino> it kinda bangs tho
[3:35:31] <kaidogs> yeah fgd
[3:35:31] <+Shonen_hero> I love it
[3:35:33] <slackerunchained> This song really IS the worst choice. LUL
[3:35:33] <nailwind> the best bad ending
[3:35:33] <peachy996> There's a song that fits way better
[3:35:33] <BlackermanZX> its because its the bad ending
[3:35:34] <TalisKanju> Watch the opening with the voices now
[3:35:34] <stardustcrusad3r> that little pinch harmonic
[3:35:34] <GHouseduivel> @whatatkins Pretty high note.
[3:35:35] <+illusiveSaint> 2020Shred 2020Shred 2020Shred 2020Shred
[3:35:35] <BlackLabud> Each ending has a different ending credits song
[3:35:35] <+SolGainer> @QueequegTheater There is no canon ending because nothing follows up on this game really
[3:35:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> CHUH DUH NUH NUH NUH
[3:35:35] <%IGgy_IGsen> This game is art but I hate how it makes me cry.
[3:35:35] <+Casavilla458> this game obviously came out before but there is a little bit of mgs3 ending that you could make some comparisons to
[3:35:36] <%WutangchickeN> BANGER ALERT LUL
[3:35:36] <%crybirb> I love Reggie EMPTY STARE at the HORIZON after this ending.
[3:35:37] <mexicansunglasses> it's kinda a banger lol
[3:35:38] <cody_g_smith1> I finished Silent Hill 2 yesterday
[3:35:40] <dukenux> Time to YT other endings
[3:35:40] <jetstreamlove_R> This ending song just ruins the whole mood
[3:35:42] <dukenux> carg
[3:35:42] <Aussie_Manny> i don't like this song being after that
[3:35:43] <NotHereToStream> people lash out in desperation
[3:35:44] <Scrapl> this is the ending that the creators considered their favorite, but they didn't want to say "canon ending"
[3:35:45] <%livlinn> kiichiHeadbanganimated kiichiHeadbanganimated kiichiHeadbanganimated
[3:35:47] <+Undenizen> speaking of loneliness - can you guess why so many enemies have a weird sexual vibe?
[3:35:51] <ElBuraindo> Saber has Class advantage over Lancer, this game follows FGO rules for combat
[3:35:53] <%ChoculaUltra> I really hope the writers behind SH2 are living happy lives rn because SHEEEEEESH
[3:35:53] <moontail95> the musics a great clue that you got a bad ending
[3:35:54] <+Bitscreed> I teared up during that letter. I always do. :(
[3:35:55] <nailwind> BANGING
[3:35:56] <wotan316> against the machine?
[3:35:58] <majindusto> Yep...Max got Leave first  try
[3:36:00] <dukenux> RAGE AGAINST YOU SAY?
[3:36:02] <mortificent> All ending fit and can be canon
[3:36:02] <lostallmyaccs> Different endings has different music at the credits
[3:36:02] <QueequegTheater> coxJam coxJam coxJam coxJam
[3:36:04] <BlackLabud> They should've picked one of the other credit songs for this ending
[3:36:08] <%crybirb> @ElBuraindo What?!
[3:36:09] <NireFuster> All the endings of the game are equally as plausible, they're all canon
[3:36:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ElBuraindo ?'
[3:36:13] <Darren716> Mary died 3 years ago, or did she get sick 3 years ago? hmm
[3:36:16] <santietch> leave has the good ending song
[3:36:16] <cody_g_smith1> I think i got the leave ending
[3:36:17] <+SolidusRex> All endings are valid, even the Dog ending
[3:36:18] <Ozzync> Watch the intro please
[3:36:19] <BlackermanZX> they check the knife too much and never healed to full health
[3:36:21] <%WutangchickeN> p00sJAM p00sJAM p00sJAM p00sJAM p00sJAM p00sJAM p00sJAM
[3:36:24] <jorniev> this being the canon ending is probably not real
[3:36:25] <DelgotHansto> ALL MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS
[3:36:25] <+illusiveSaint> so true and it's so relatable even when your a kid when i played it
[3:36:26] <NireFuster> ESPECIALLY the dog ending LUL
[3:36:26] <+セビー> doge end
[3:36:26] <+brokensaint1982> @Unidenizen And why James's car was at a no tell motel
[3:36:26] <nailwind> with how hard James stepped on the pedal, the song fits LUL
[3:36:28] <+HalloKeyori111> Now for the UFO ending
[3:36:32] <peachy996> @BlackLabud I've paired this ending with the song from Leave ending. Way better
[3:36:33] <mortificent> yeap, the best thing is that ALL ENDINGS ARE VALID
[3:36:34] <QueequegTheater> @ElBuraindo He's not wrong, just half an hour late
[3:36:35] <%livlinn> James had a suppressed libido PrideShrug
[3:36:37] <dukenux> The Dog Ending is the only canon one
[3:36:38] <wotan316> no FrankerZ end is bad end
[3:36:38] <+ItsSunderland> yessss please talk about all the endings!!!
[3:36:39] <%G_Thunders> This ending sucks because he basically just did the same thing as Angela
[3:36:39] <linSP> I got bad news to everyone in chat
[3:36:39] <StarlitStunner> Time for DOG
[3:36:40] <slackerunchained> James made some severe mistakes in his actions... but he's STILL sympathetic in choosing those paths.
[3:36:42] <Darren716> This is THE one
[3:36:42] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yeah, not healing to full is like the biggest determinant
[3:36:43] <w_khan> thats the sad end
[3:36:43] <+HalloKeyori111> 6 endings
[3:36:43] <Alzero83> BAD END
[3:36:47] <dukenux> Kappa
[3:36:47] <jorniev> WATCH the other endings
[3:36:47] <jetstreamlove_R> It is implied that Mary was always at the back of the trunk
[3:36:51] <%MyNameIsRasus> Kappa
[3:36:52] <kaidogs> ok now dog ending
[3:36:53] <bleugh> i got Leave the first time around
[3:36:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He just went for a joyride
[3:36:54] <olm46> Italics :D
[3:36:54] <agustorm123> Shit ending
[3:36:55] <+SolGainer> Yeah but you looked at her knife too much so you did
[3:36:55] <+DatAsuna> do watch the others yeah
[3:36:56] <Ozzync> 2001
[3:36:57] <puluxor> IN WATER
[3:36:58] <+illusiveSaint> this ending In Water is my fav one even if its the "bad end"
[3:37:00] <cody_g_smith1> I actually finished it originally on ps2, and got the water ending, and this current playthrough was on ps3 and got the leave ending
[3:37:00] <Treasure_Vault> Look up the ending conditions too, they're wild and crazy.
[3:37:02] <+DatAsuna> "water" end
[3:37:03] <TalisKanju> Pat probably told Woolie to look at the knife as many times as possible
[3:37:04] <jorniev> IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE
[3:37:04] <%superc37> woolie he was lying to himself
[3:37:05] <+Breaknoon> she was probably up front with him actually
[3:37:05] <linSP> coward ending
[3:37:07] <BlackLabud> You should watch the other endings and see what determines which ending you get. It's sooool cool
[3:37:07] <w_khan> I think they got it because of looking at the knife too much
[3:37:08] <+cursedwithadhd> Pat perspective on life makes a lot more sense if this is what he played as a kid
[3:37:10] <mortificent> Look up the ending conditions
[3:37:10] <+healnavi> the suicide ending is the best one by a mile
[3:37:11] <Bubsla> You got the bad ending, it is probably the worst one, but it is supposedly canon for the future games. It really sucks though
[3:37:11] <dinnydanny777> Oh this song oof
[3:37:12] <Lagseene_> He just took a shower
[3:37:13] <+HalloKeyori111> look up the ending conditions
[3:37:13] <+whatatkins> SourPls
[3:37:14] <Aussie_Manny> suicide ending
[3:37:14] <Nabs96> So is the thing about James cheating on his wife real or just a theory?
[3:37:15] <+UncleMcgoo> The idea of a canon ending defeats the whole point
[3:37:15] <Timarkot> Isn't this the ending everyone gets first try?
[3:37:15] <slackerunchained> This is - NO lie - my favorite ending.
[3:37:16] <alikeran> the song :(
[3:37:18] <Darren716> Yeah don't just watch the endings, read how you get them
[3:37:18] <NireFuster> Leave > In Water
[3:37:18] <+TwitchGuy2021> Canon ending
[3:37:19] <lostallmyaccs> BibleThump
[3:37:19] <+ultran122> oh hey, the actual good credits music
[3:37:19] <%shadowsofpain> Looked at the knife too many times yeah
[3:37:19] <ハクア> It's probably the least subtle thing in this game LUL
[3:37:19] <+ItsSunderland> Personally I think the Maria ending is the "bad end" cause it means James didn't LEARN anything
[3:37:20] <%MelBrooksKA> @Darren716 I believe the explanation is generally "3 years" came from the doctor saying she had 3 years to live
[3:37:20] <%thotbane> @healnavi not "leaves with laura?"
[3:37:20] <DingusMcBaseball> this song
[3:37:20] <zanzibarian_hamster> Bad end because you looked at knife and didn't heal much
[3:37:21] <hassanico2> Oh, fan credits
[3:37:22] <%MyNameIsRasus> Look up how to get each ending
[3:37:23] <Zap_Rowsdower32> It's not actually the worst ending
[3:37:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YO THIS SONG
[3:37:23] <pennykettle_> bigmanjapan
[3:37:23] <OblivionSword1> oh the mod teams
[3:37:24] <skyenoz> It's thematically appropriate
[3:37:24] <+MagiKestral> it's implied that the trunk has her inside
[3:37:24] <jetpack_rorschasch> The dead guy in the chair in the apartment could've been James after he shot himself while watching the tape.
[3:37:25] <+Undenizen> in his mind he's not committing suicide
[3:37:25] <arkv01> now for the real ending theme
[3:37:26] <fiddlestef97> mary was in the trunk at the start
[3:37:27] <DelgotHansto> The most unconvincing line delivery on "I would never kill myself"
[3:37:29] <+brokensaint1982> there really is no canon ending
[3:37:30] <$RunningNGunning> Good Job Enhanced Edition team Clap
[3:37:31] <+theoldone001> Finally, some good fucking music
[3:37:32] <nyacoo> there's three endings you can get first run
[3:37:32] <%DoktorZee> this songgggggg BibleThump CHILLS
[3:37:32] <Dio_TR> Shout out to the modders
[3:37:32] <%crybirb> @Bubsla You are insane this is the best ending.
[3:37:33] <OblivionSword1> thanks modders
[3:37:34] <Dr_Mooose> oof this sing
[3:37:34] <Ozzync> eyyyyy at least the enhaced team put a more addequate song
[3:37:35] <%sirisvirus> it's the angela ending
[3:37:35] <cody_g_smith1> Some of the musoic in this game is so creepy
[3:37:37] <nailwind> biggest cap by Jame
[3:37:38] <Dr_Mooose> *song
[3:37:39] <peachy996> @TalisKanju Actually Woolie did other things to get In Water in a more natural way. Not like Pat constantly glancing at the knife LUL
[3:37:39] <NireFuster> Definitely check the other endings out, the conditions for the different endings are also pretty wild LUL
[3:37:39] <BlackermanZX> i love this song
[3:37:39] <%hereiam407> GYROMANCY
[3:37:41] <Darren716> No cult
[3:37:41] <agustorm123> Music goes hard
[3:37:42] <%MajorCrasher> I feel like I respect this game more now, but it still doesn't resonate with me like it seems to most people. I think it's because I've grown numb to these kinds of situations from my own life experiences.
[3:37:42] <%livlinn> The coolest thing is that organic game style determines the ending
[3:37:42] <TalisKanju> No GYROMANCY
[3:37:44] <haisho> no goop
[3:37:44] <%ChoculaUltra> not even a lick of gyromancy
[3:37:46] <Melchior_the_Wise> DOg Ending best
[3:37:46] <%RemedyofRevenge> Will you guys be looking at the alternative endings on stream? @WoolieVersus
[3:37:47] <+Undenizen> thank god they chose an actual song
[3:37:48] <phonographer> OhMyDog
[3:37:48] <%superc37> also like lets be real in water is probs the ending james deserved as a character
[3:37:49] <+healnavi> @thotbane That ending blows. it just undercuts everything for a happy resolution
[3:37:49] <%dds333a> @taliskanju it was blind for the most part
[3:37:50] <ghilbor> you'll never guess
[3:37:50] <%hereiam407> No cult BS
[3:37:51] <restingbones> I wish we still got games like this from big budget companies
[3:37:51] <%holydeviant1> I actually really like how this game handles multiple endings
[3:37:52] <dukenux> @TalisKanju "Oh yea just rub your face all over that knife. also look at Mary's photo and Letter every time you can" ~Pat
[3:37:52] <marshalmorphino22> No devil
[3:37:53] <ry4n_c00per> gyromancy atpFeelsBeardMan
[3:37:53] <+king_of_mystery2> Woolie you will never guess how you got that ending
[3:37:54] <+DenpaDev> straigh into SH3 boys
[3:37:55] <QueequegTheater> WHERE IS MY GYROMANCY
[3:37:55] <+Shonen_hero> not even a single spin
[3:37:56] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus all the dead bodies are modified james models
[3:37:57] <Bubsla> @crybirb how? it's the least satisfying one
[3:37:58] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus There are no shit like 15 factors that play into what ending you get that you do throughout the entire game
[3:37:58] <jorniev> THE SOOOONG
[3:37:58] <Tracazoid> The gyromancy was in our hearts all along
[3:37:59] <ElBuraindo> thinking about the possibility of Mary being in the car makes Leaving even MORE DISTURBING for a Good+ ending
[3:37:59] <dinnydanny777> The intonation on "I would never kill *myself*" is golden LUL
[3:37:59] <%hereiam407> 'RITUAL'
[3:37:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> There's 6 endings I believe
[3:37:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> The devil is trauma
[3:38:00] <yeildingthought> James deserves redemption.
[3:38:00] <mrtanaka111> the devil was us
[3:38:00] <+セビー> gyromancy BibleThump
[3:38:00] <shieldecho> Wow, never saw this screen, this is gorgeous
[3:38:01] <slackerunchained> Yeah. Mary is  - supposedly - in the trunk of the car and James simply blocked that factoid out.
[3:38:02] <linSP> Mary wanted him to live on, this ending is melodramatic
[3:38:03] <OkamiDude15> @Nabs96 maybe not outright stated but pretty heavily implied
[3:38:05] <mortificent> I think it was mostly the Knife
[3:38:06] <Chatterbox1991> in water
[3:38:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> In the Water (Bad Ending)
[3:38:07] <%livlinn> Minimal cult stuff
[3:38:07] <+HeroSolaire> This pc port even with mod is problematic
[3:38:08] <%DoktorZee> looking at the knife ending lol
[3:38:09] <%sirisvirus> its angela's knife
[3:38:09] <%PunishedBuck> @WoolieVersus Rebirth ending has all the cult stuff
[3:38:10] <+illusiveSaint> this ending takes some effort to do on first run kinda
[3:38:10] <slackerunchained> @WoolieVersus "In Water"
[3:38:10] <Darren716> @WoolieVersus Please read up on the ending conditions, it's wild
[3:38:10] <QueequegTheater> In Water
[3:38:11] <+maria_luke> why oh why did you look at the knife so muc
[3:38:12] <wotan316> 2 types of silent hill, wacky evil cult silent hillllllllllllllllllll and jacobs ladder silent hill
[3:38:12] <%dds333a> @majorcrasher LUL
[3:38:12] <+0neReeler> In Water
[3:38:14] <VincentGraves> shoulda kept your health at green all the time
[3:38:14] <+HeroSolaire> people should just play ps2 version instead
[3:38:15] <+tempestzephyr> water ending
[3:38:15] <+SolidusRex> The "In Water" ending
[3:38:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:38:17] <pennykettle_> CHAT: where can I go to read all the theories and details
[3:38:20] <jetstreamlove_R> In water, you looked at the knife too many times
[3:38:21] <skyshinecrusader> look it up
[3:38:22] <%LastHazzerd> he's not ASKING chat
[3:38:23] <%crybirb> @Bubsla It's the most real. If you lived through something like a loved one being sick to a point of no return the feelings expressed in this ending are incredibly real.
[3:38:24] <%RemedyofRevenge> the Wiki
[3:38:25] <%ElMaestroChoque> ElMaestroChoque subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[3:38:25] <w_khan> looking at the knife too much pushes you to suicide end
[3:38:30] <+duskrush> iirc examining the photo frequently is an ending determinant
[3:38:30] <dukenux> No Gyromancy to save you from your own hell vargSad
[3:38:30] <+Bitscreed> What I love most is how this game establishes the town as its own being, something older than the cult that arguable distorted it
[3:38:31] <%MelBrooksKA> @pennykettle_ Wiki is a good start
[3:38:31] <DelgotHansto> You got this because of examining the knife and staying at low HP too often
[3:38:31] <%dds333a> @linsp yeah, and he didnt do it
[3:38:32] <SaintSalted> kept looking at the knife damn
[3:38:32] <Scrapl> my first playthrough i got this end
[3:38:33] <BlackermanZX> SilentHillMemories has all the conditions
[3:38:33] <+SolGainer> @pennykettle_ go to the SH wiki
[3:38:33] <+plsnolookatme> @WoolieVersus That was "In Water". You kept looking at the knife, refused to heal yourself to top for a lot of the time, and you kept looking at the letter and picture
[3:38:36] <%superc37> @pennykettle_ mat n pat's lp
[3:38:36] <zepelinnn1> STRUMMER THIS ENDING BAD
[3:38:37] <+Shonen_hero> Eddie sucks
[3:38:38] <majindusto> Your ending  is called "IN WATER"
[3:38:38] <Zap_Rowsdower32> The ending you got is the "In Water" ending.
[3:38:39] <Ozzync> fuck eddie
[3:38:40] <peachy996> If you read the book on the roof, if you listen to the doctor at the hotel, if you don't care about being at being highest health and if you investigate Angela's Knife, You Get This
[3:38:41] <mortificent> words like Canon and Bad End don't really fit this game
[3:38:42] <%Kriss1827> Chat he will more than likely see the endings like last time
[3:38:42] <$RunningNGunning> knife + Only healing half way is what mostly led to this ending
[3:38:42] <dan_g_v> near to worst ending in my opinion
[3:38:45] <goldmod> other endings are depressing
[3:38:51] <jetpack_rorschasch> Check out the other endings to see how you feel about the whole thing Woolie.
[3:38:51] <dukenux> Eddie's a school shooter in the makng
[3:38:54] <dinnydanny777> :(
[3:38:55] <+Breaknoon> everything is always on fire for her
[3:38:56] <%LastHazzerd> Angela so fuckin' sad
[3:38:57] <StebTheVee> self loathing
[3:38:57] <+MagiKestral> And Laura had no trauma, so she saw no monsters
[3:38:59] <%ChoculaUltra> iirc listening to that whole hallway convo/flashback thing was part of getting In Water too
[3:38:59] <GHouseduivel> Angela is also on the cover art of this game.
[3:39:02] <mrtanaka111> eddie es sad too, in a repulsive kinda of way
[3:39:02] <cody_g_smith1> I'm actually currently playing through the original Silent Hill right now
[3:39:02] <Scrapl> just kept checking all my items, so picture and knife got a lot of looking
[3:39:03] <slackerunchained> It's MORE than simply looking at the knife. Other factors contribue too, like listening to the convo on the Ham radio and the long hallway
[3:39:05] <+illusiveSaint> @pennykettle_ ending theories, pat and matts lp, wikis
[3:39:06] <Darren716> "love"
[3:39:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> @dukenux except he's like a grown ass man
[3:39:06] <NireFuster> You did a lot of very specific things that got you this ending LUL
[3:39:06] <marrowjuice> so most people say that mary was in the trunk of his car, but i want to say masahiro ito said he believed she was in the back seat
[3:39:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> SO FAR AWAAAAY
[3:39:07] <azure_rivers> NotLikeThis Poor Angela
[3:39:08] <peachy996> Oh I think there's an ending worse than In Water
[3:39:08] <+brokensaint1982> @pennykettle_ look up a streamer called nubzombie here on twitch, he goes over everything about the game in vast detail
[3:39:08] <majindusto> Angela  deserved Better :(
[3:39:09] <dukenux> Angela got the roughest deal
[3:39:10] <@Squdnate> I can recommend looking up the other endings, if you're up for it @WoolieVersus
[3:39:11] <+ultran122> Angel SHREDDING on Guitar Hero
[3:39:11] <+SolGainer> No she's looking for mom to KILL her
[3:39:11] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:39:14] <%MyNameIsRasus> REGGIE WITH DRAGONFORCE
[3:39:14] <+Casavilla458> without spoiling too much the endings depend on little things throughout the game obviously New Game Plus endings acquire second playthrough
[3:39:19] <BlackLabud> Maria is way worse than In Water IMO
[3:39:21] <shieldecho> The...ending with the most "hope" is the Leave ending, I'd say.
[3:39:26] <dukenux> @Melchior_the_Wise doesn't mean he can't shoot up a school...
[3:39:28] <w_khan> But to be fair her mom didnt love her or its great help as well
[3:39:29] <NireFuster> Leave is a fantastic ending
[3:39:30] <peachy996> Yeah Maria is the roughest ending
[3:39:30] <NotHereToStream> true ending is dog ending
[3:39:31] <ElBuraindo> listening to her in the hallway also pushes you into bad end territory
[3:39:31] <oak120> Maria is easily the worst
[3:39:33] <nailwind> stairway to heaven
[3:39:36] <+ItsSunderland> Maria ending is the bad ending imo. Because it means James didn't learn ANYTHING if he gets it.
[3:39:36] <%ChoculaUltra> the Dog ending is easily the most profound and moving Kappa
[3:39:38] <thomasvalentine31> @peachy996 Depends on your "perspective" in regard to it
[3:39:38] <DSD24> In Water ending
[3:39:39] <+plsnolookatme> Maria is the worst ending, Leave and In Water are both equally good
[3:39:40] <%hereiam407> Rank S?
[3:39:41] <skyenoz> "In water"
[3:39:41] <$MattyNezz> Cheer1500 A lot of people are going to say that "In Water" (your ending) is the best one, but I always found Leave to be the best ending. In Water is the most emotionally resonate, but it's a story about coming to terms with the guilt that comes with a terminal loved one, and for James to reach that acceptance and to begin to move on, I think makes the most sense.
[3:39:41] <Agami23> boat max speed
[3:39:41] <+AngelYoumou> ANGELA DESERVED SO MUCH BETTER
[3:39:41] <DelgotHansto> Rebirth actually is just kinda meh tho
[3:39:41] <+kewlmyc> In Water
[3:39:41] <slackerunchained> That Darkness imprisoned him... :(
[3:39:42] <TacoSaIad> S-rank your grief.
[3:39:43] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> In Water
[3:39:43] <Scrapl> @shieldecho what about rebirth? there's true hope in that one
[3:39:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BOT MAX SPEED

[3:39:48] <ghilbor> FrankerZ
[3:39:48] <+HalloKeyori111> 4 Main endings and 2 secrect endings
[3:39:48] <+DatAsuna> 4 Normal Ends + 1 Dog end
[3:39:48] <Bubsla> @crybirb the good ending is just as realistic though
[3:39:49] <NireFuster> GOOD RANK
[3:39:49] <%BreadLM> LOVE this song
[3:39:49] <SchroedingersFerret> There honestly are no good or bad endings
[3:39:50] <mortificent> Look up the requirements
[3:39:51] <Yes_Im_Leviathan> Rank is 4.6
[3:39:52] <dukenux> please play Born from a Wish, it's really short
[3:39:53] <BlackermanZX> amazing rank tho
[3:39:55] <DelgotHansto> Rebirth doesn't fit at all
[3:39:56] <+illusiveSaint> In Water feels the most thematical, Leave is the hopeful feel good ending
[3:39:56] <hassanico2> DEFEAT ENEMIES BY SHOOTING
[3:39:56] <ハクア> Pianissimo Epilogue
[3:39:56] <R_Blaze> It is all about feeling guilt, even if it isn't their fault
[3:39:57] <jorniev> my favorite ending is the leave ending
[3:39:59] <burquina> In Water is the most thematically fitting ending, i feel. Leave is the best one for James
[3:39:59] <Darren716> Yeah max boat speed!
[3:40:00] <crudjandall> "Leave" is less depressing but I think "In Water" is tonaly fitting
[3:40:00] <+ItsSunderland> Maria ending means James is just doomed to repeat the cycle forever
[3:40:00] <hassanico2> 6 ENEMIES SHOT LUL
[3:40:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> 6 Enemy by shooting UL LUL LUL
[3:40:01] <%hereiam407> Boat Stage time
[3:40:05] <jetpack_rorschasch> There are 4 other endings.
[3:40:07] <MeImoth> BOAT SPEED
[3:40:08] <lostallmyaccs> Pianissimo Epilogue is my favorite SourPls
[3:40:09] <BlackLabud> How you get each ending is probably the coolest way a videogame has done it in history
[3:40:10] <NireFuster> BOAT STAGE TIME LUL
[3:40:11] <%livlinn> 12hrs not bad
[3:40:11] <Darren716> I mean they count kick deaths as fighting
[3:40:13] <shotgunmcdooter> Leave is my canon endng
[3:40:13] <goldmod> MAX SPEED
[3:40:14] <%RemedyofRevenge> sub 12 hour speed run Pogchamp
[3:40:14] <dukenux> bro
[3:40:15] <%ChoculaUltra> the TV was included in the enemies defeated by shooting LUL
[3:40:16] <+vascillia> @WoolieVersus "Damage 2172pts" hey 2172 is the year Zone of the Enders 1 took place!
[3:40:17] <hassanico2> 110 enemies!
[3:40:17] <TalisKanju> Now try Riddle Level on the Highest difficulty, fuck
[3:40:17] <dukenux> 104
[3:40:18] <slackerunchained> Yeah! "Born From a Wish"  is a great follow-up! Stream not over, yet. :D
[3:40:18] <QueequegTheater> WILD SPEED
[3:40:18] <jorniev> 6 ENEMIES SHOT!?
[3:40:18] <%G_Thunders> I like “Leave” because that way Angela, Eddie, and James all get different outcomes
[3:40:18] <+meattube1> This is the ultimate game about grief
[3:40:19] <$RunningNGunning> 6 enemies killed by shooting LUL
[3:40:20] <StarlitStunner> Boat go zooom
[3:40:22] <jenji919> Doge ending
[3:40:22] <%Indigo_Automaton> 110 Guilt Monsters Slain
[3:40:23] <Qu1ckyyy> 110 enemies killed but only 6 by gun wow
[3:40:24] <+DatAsuna> This is why pyramid head coming back is stupid yes
[3:40:28] <+Bitscreed> LOL! I forgot they measured boat speed
[3:40:31] <OblivionSword1> 104 bonked enemies LUL
[3:40:32] <peachy996> I personally prefer Leave.
[3:40:33] <dukenux> James really needed the BOP
[3:40:35] <derap41> bonk
[3:40:36] <Space_Pagan> BOAT SPEED
[3:40:41] <csterra11> Pyramid Head only belongs to James
[3:40:41] <+illusiveSaint> thats the Maria ending your talking about lol
[3:40:43] <%Onorekian> that boat max speed tho
[3:40:43] <Fuji808> @WoolieVersus there is a playlist named 'Silent Hill 2 Endings' from the channel 'Silent Hill Memories'. You received the In Water ending, so you can skip that one.
[3:40:43] <+Mr_Pylon> aw yeah boat speed!
[3:40:43] <marshalmorphino22> Boat speed stats are the best
[3:40:43] <nailwind> i love In Water so much
[3:40:49] <%dds333a> @cody_g_smith1 intentionally so
[3:40:50] <+ItsSunderland> I love this song a lot
[3:40:50] <+healnavi> Silent Hill isn't evil. It just gives people what they ask for.
[3:40:51] <DelgotHansto> Hmm whats the Boat Speed record?
[3:40:51] <%Onorekian> very important statistics
[3:40:52] <ハクア> they only count the last hit for this, so the fighting is him stomping enemies
[3:40:53] <VincentGraves> pyramid head was just a version of James
[3:40:53] <w_khan> Pyramid Head is his constriction, sexual inhibition, rage
[3:40:54] <BlackermanZX> the manifestation of james's sexual frustation
[3:40:55] <+brokensaint1982> now you see why Pyramid Head being in ANY OTHER GAME MAKES NO SENS
[3:40:55] <%BreadLM> I'm so glad Woolie got this ending, its the best one.
[3:40:57] <+SolidusRex> @peachy996 Same, I'm an optimistic person
[3:41:05] <%dds333a> @marshalmorphino22 he will be fine LUL
[3:41:08] <majindusto> "Born from a Wish" time?
[3:41:09] <Treasure_Vault> So, why's he got a pyramid head?
[3:41:12] <dinnydanny777> The Maria ending is bad but also kind of great
[3:41:14] <+Pugalug> Hello. I'm a member of SH2:EE project. I've been lurking during your SH2 streams. It's been great to watch. The sound bug is an inherit issue with SH2 PC and has proven to be incredibly difficult to fix, short of having to completely overhaul the game's audio handling.
[3:41:16] <+Shonen_hero> SIlent Hill.... is a broken place for broken people
[3:41:16] <slackerunchained> @peachy996 "Leave" has more hope... but the fact that Jame's dad never sees him or Mary again in the future bodes ill for that path.
[3:41:17] <thomasvalentine31> I still cannot figure out why the boat section has a ranking, but it's great
[3:41:18] <Melchior_the_Wise> actually 6 endings
[3:41:20] <Bubsla> @pennykettle_ I wouldn't read up too much on the wiki because they really over analyze the game it kind of ruins it
[3:41:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> Stomps
[3:41:21] <+kewlmyc> 1 out of 6
[3:41:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> Stomping
[3:41:21] <%superc37> hey mods, is it alright if i link a video i found wwith all the endings?
[3:41:22] <wotan316> jacobs ladder silent hill of the deeper kind of silent hill, but i will always love wacky cult silent hill
[3:41:23] <+ItsSunderland> Yeah I want to believe that if you took Pyramid Head's helmet off it would just be James' face under there
[3:41:24] <%ChoculaUltra> my dumbass saw Pyramid Head in Dead by Daylight and I thought the survivor would be James LUL
[3:41:24] <Ozzync> yep
[3:41:25] <puluxor> Because stomping counts as melee
[3:41:25] <QueequegTheater> @Treasure_Vault It represents the weight of James' guilt
[3:41:26] <Darren716> If you kick it's fighting
[3:41:26] <mortificent> yeah
[3:41:29] <Tracazoid> The power of stomps concours all
[3:41:29] <moontail95> lol
[3:41:30] <%Javaa01> Stomping is melee
[3:41:30] <+セビー> pyramids are the most powerful shape
[3:41:33] <nailwind> @Treasure_Vault sharp shapes are threatening and its as heavy as his guilt
[3:41:36] <+Spring_Lion> We’re navigating through his psyche
[3:41:37] <+brokensaint1982> Pyramid Head is the representation of James' guilt and desire to be punished for his wrong doings
[3:41:38] <Fuji808> @Pugalug Thank you
[3:41:39] <+healnavi> LUL
[3:41:40] <Fabpsi_> guns don't kill monsters. Stomping does.
[3:41:40] <%dds333a> @wotan316 Jacobs ladder hill is in 1 as well

[3:41:46] <shieldecho> @Treasure_Vault I remember seeing an interview with the art designer saying he wanted it to make it look like the helmet hurt to wear.
[3:41:47] <%hereiam407> The Boat guy was drunk!
[3:41:47] <alikeran> that's so funny LUL
[3:41:48] <ghilbor> LUL

[3:42:27] <Ozzync> DID they watch the intro w/ voices?
[3:42:28] <+HalloKeyori111> the endings are super complicated
[3:42:28] <MattyNezz> It's really arcane. Not healing, reading the letter or looking at MAry's picture, etc.
[3:42:29] <oak120> If you spend too much time on the water James gets some bad thoughts
[3:42:29] <Fabpsi_> unlocks the speed boat ending, basically speed2
[3:42:30] <+NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus there are invisible point systems based on certain events you find and certain items you inspect
[3:42:30] <%DoktorZee> YOOO YEAH
[3:42:30] <goldmod> yees

[3:46:12] <Darren716> Nah there are some cut scenes here
[3:46:13] <dashwallkick> there's a ton of CGI in this that isn't from the game
[3:46:13] <+HalloKeyori111> a lot of scenes in the intro are original scenes
[3:46:15] <GHouseduivel> I have a gamefaqs link on how to get the other endings can I post it @mods

[3:46:29] <BlackermanZX> she is totally not real
[3:46:29] <+Shonen_hero> sort of
[3:46:31] <%hereiam407> They aren't going to play the extended Maria missions?
[3:46:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus you can check the wiki for the ending requirements. Silenthillmemories or silenthil fandom
[3:46:33] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> NOW LET'S WATCH THE OTHER ENDINGS

[3:46:34] <+brokensaint1982> as real as a flesh golem created by the town can be
[3:46:35] <Bubsla> You've seen all the cutscenes except for the endings
[3:46:35] <+GrayMatterMiner> the intro changes a bit when you beat the game
[3:46:36] <QueequegTheater> @jetstreamlove_R Good art direction
[3:46:36] <DirigibleDPlomo> oh yea you need to play the side scenario!!!
[3:46:36] <ElBuraindo> shining hill

[3:46:37] <dukenux> 100% REAL WIFE NO FAKE
[3:46:37] <w_khan> she is sort of real
[3:46:37] <Aussie_Manny> Faker! lytUSEGUN
[3:46:38] <+AngelYoumou> We should TOTALLY do Born from a Wish
[3:46:40] <+Mr_Pylon> CG filter putting in work decades later!
[3:46:42] <R_Blaze> Theme Of Laura
[3:46:42] <luckysteak> @crudjandall thank you, I just remember the SBFP playthrough where pat did it deliberately because he likes it the most
[3:46:42] <dinnydanny777> James in the Restroom monkaS
[3:46:45] <%PunishedBuck> @WoolieVersus all ending videos with the requirements https://www.silenthillmemories.net/sh2/endings_en.htm
[3:46:47] <Scrapl> james in the restroom
[3:46:48] <bippityjones> Silent Hill 3 trailer?
[3:46:50] <+Shonen_hero> she is in a way real and in a way not. One could say she was conjured
[3:46:51] <+セビー> silent hill hates this one trick
[3:46:52] <ForgottenGhost1> Hope Woolie finds about Born from a Wish
[3:46:52] <+tussletoes> i do hope they play born from a wish and see the other endings
[3:46:54] <agustorm123> Silent hill 3 now
[3:46:55] <majindusto> Born from a Wish Time
[3:46:55] <Darmanimon> Yo chat I just got here, what ending did they get?
[3:46:55] <peachy996> Sometimes at least in SH1 and 2, there are bonus scenes not seen in the game
[3:46:56] <linSP> play the side story!
[3:46:56] <jenji919> Real fake waives
[3:46:57] <dukenux> BORN FROM A WISH Woolie pls
[3:46:58] <Ozzync> there was an intro with voices
[3:46:58] <%MightyDuckShoes> Does this have the side game?
[3:46:58] <Nabs96> what's the name of that track does anyone know
[3:46:58] <+SolGainer> It's complicated
[3:46:59] <+kewlmyc> Just Youtube it
[3:47:00] <+Breaknoon> YES
[3:47:00] <DrkJP520> maybe you can see the endings in this version
[3:47:01] <+DatAsuna> Just google Silent Hill 2 Endings, first result
[3:47:01] <keankong85> wasn't there a UFO ending
[3:47:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> yes
[3:47:02] <nailwind> tell me why tell me why
[3:47:03] <%hereiam407> So much to do
[3:47:03] <Tumier> VoteYea
[3:47:03] <TalisKanju> I like how it's called "Theme of Laura" and how it has nothing to do with Laura
[3:47:05] <+ultran122> @Darmanimon In Water
[3:47:07] <DirigibleDPlomo> Do Born from a Wish
[3:47:09] <stormhawk9891> Born From a Wish SUCKS
[3:47:10] <Deimos002> yeyeyeyeyeyeye
[3:47:11] <jetstreamlove_R> That woman is literally everyone waifu manifesting straight out to get ya
[3:47:13] <MattyNezz> Born from a Wish is not super great. It's not terrible or anything, but a world without it isn't a problem
[3:47:13] <%emMmDeeKay> you can't do it by reloading
[3:47:13] <%dds333a> TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT
[3:47:15] <ElBuraindo> SHE'S REAL TO ME DAMNIT
[3:47:16] <Darmanimon> ok ty ultran
[3:47:17] <NireFuster> Unlike Silent Hill 1, the endings of SH2 are all 'canon' and equally plausible, so there's no bad or good here, only different scenarios that could happen
[3:47:17] <marshalmorphino22> Need a cool-down after this
[3:47:18] <GHouseduivel> @WoolieVersus Can I put a gamefaqs link for the endings?
[3:47:18] <lostallmyaccs> hot take, born from a wish is pretty weak
[3:47:18] <mrtanaka111> who was the flauros?
[3:47:19] <%WutangchickeN> @woolieversus the link above from @punishedbuck has them
[3:47:21] <Aussie_Manny> 👌
[3:47:24] <+HalloKeyori111> Born from a wish is just not needed honestly
[3:47:25] <majindusto> Woolie...Play Born from a Wish
[3:47:27] <crudjandall> @luckysteak I think the knife is a big factor, I got stuck in apartments for a while and kept checking everything again
[3:47:28] <henchmanshuffle> No Born from a Wish?
[3:47:31] <%Kriss1827> chat give em links
[3:47:34] <marshalmorphino22> I can’t wait for Woolie versus Silent Hill 3
[3:47:38] <ghilbor> the other endings are obtained by just being built different
[3:47:41] <+brokensaint1982> Maria was designed off of Christina Aguilera from the 199 Grammy awards
[3:47:42] <%Theycallmenerf> Born from a wish?
[3:47:42] <majindusto> Born from a Wish is so short
[3:47:43] <$RunningNGunning> Are we doing Born from a Wish also?
[3:47:44] <Darmanimon> Born from a Wish is this game's The Answer
[3:47:48] <w_khan> just Sillent Hill 2 endings gets you to the wiki
[3:47:49] <+brokensaint1982> *1999
[3:47:49] <+SolidusRex> Justin Case is a pretty cool guy
[3:47:51] <+tempestzephyr> Born from a Wish?
[3:47:53] <iswearimjustdandy> Im so fucking excited for SH3 its my favorite
[3:47:53] <Timarkot> What's wrong with born from a wish?
[3:47:54] <skyshinecrusader> Silenthillmemories is the site for endings
[3:47:55] <marshalmorphino22> @brokensaint1982 wasn’t it the kids choice awards?
[3:47:56] <+healnavi> Nope
[3:47:58] <Ozzync> ohhhh yeah born from a wish
[3:47:58] <NireFuster> Nope
[3:48:00] <BlackLabud> Oh you have no diea
[3:48:00] <+ItsSunderland> I really feel bad for Maria though, like. It's not her fault ):
[3:48:01] <+HalloKeyori111> Its nothing like the last game!
[3:48:02] <ghilbor> Nein
[3:48:02] <BlackLabud> idea*
[3:48:03] <+SolGainer> Nope!
[3:48:03] <MattyNezz> Nooooope
[3:48:03] <stormhawk9891> Nope
[3:48:04] <+AngelYoumou> Nope
[3:48:05] <%townzzzzz> IT HAS TWO BEST ENDINGS
[3:48:07] <kaidogs> well
[3:48:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man i missed the end what happened
[3:48:08] <%Javaa01> Absolutely not the case
[3:48:08] <Treasure_Vault> Silenthillmemories is #1 for endings
[3:48:08] <marshalmorphino22> Nein
[3:48:09] <Zeif00> VoteNay
[3:48:09] <+UncleMcgoo> Born From a Wish is skippable
[3:48:09] <NireFuster> It's absolutely nothing like the last game LUL
[3:48:10] <BlackermanZX> search for silent hill endings on google and it will pop up
[3:48:13] <%Theycallmenerf> Wha happun
[3:48:13] <crudjandall> I know happy endings are for babys but "Leave" makes me cry slightly less 😭
[3:48:15] <+maria_luke> yeah LIKE THAT KNIFE
[3:48:16] <+samuraiknack> Woolievs Silent Hill 3  aka the best soundtrack of the three when?
[3:48:17] <+healnavi> It's a Tokimeki Memorial style variable system
[3:48:17] <+brokensaint1982> It coukld have been Kids Choice, my mind defaults to grammys
[3:48:18] <+duskrush> The Silent Hill 2 endings are Dark Souls levels of obtuse
[3:48:19] <+HeroSolaire> This game has the most unique ending system ever made
[3:48:20] <+SolGainer> You got In Water because of the way you played
[3:48:20] <+DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Just google "Silent Hill 2 Endings" the first result is what you want
[3:48:20] <horriblegoatdemon> SilentHillMemories is the site I always used
[3:48:23] <jorniev> born from a wish is fucked
[3:48:23] <dukenux> SilentHillMemories for all your SH lore
[3:48:23] <%Javaa01> It is so much more complex then that
[3:48:24] <Bubsla> Born from a wish doesn't really add a whole lot to the main narrative in my oppinion
[3:48:27] <+Breaknoon> YES
[3:48:35] <MattyNezz> It's just hard to explain
[3:48:36] <thomasvalentine31> So the real question is, is Woolie gonan go straight with the highest puzzle difficulty for SH3?
[3:48:37] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus silent Hill memories site has evrything
[3:48:37] <MrMatternot> It's cool
[3:48:38] <+croxeye> YES
[3:48:38] <+ItsSunderland> Imagine being made JUST to be tormented and hurt over and over again
[3:48:40] <NireFuster> @crudjandall It's a very good ending! It's my personal canon one
[3:48:41] <Darmanimon> yeah the activation is called look it up on YouTube LUL
[3:48:42] <OkamiDude15> go for it
[3:48:42] <marshalmorphino22> That’s fine
[3:48:43] <goldmod> coool
[3:48:43] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's very hard to explain
[3:48:43] <+brokensaint1982> to get them you would have to play the game AGAIN
[3:48:44] <+SolGainer> Yes but you can't explain it simply
[3:48:46] <Bubsla> Sure
[3:48:46] <Treasure_Vault> Nope, just look up the ending page of Silent Hill Memories, it's got the goods
[3:48:47] <%dds333a> Mary's dress is also based off of nic cage's wife in con air
[3:48:47] <skyenoz> It's VERY obtuse
[3:48:48] <+Shonen_hero> Listen that's fine
[3:48:49] <Darren716> Read about them
[3:48:49] <+reshiramdude16> It's quite complex
[3:48:49] <+healnavi> It's calculus
[3:48:52] <%Kriss1827> read requirements then see the endning? that could be interesting
[3:48:53] <w_khan> you cant "Do it" it would take replayingmost of it
[3:48:53] <peachy996> Pat will tell you next week the requirement they are wild
[3:48:53] <Zeif00> Yeah, but there's a lot to it
[3:48:53] <skyshinecrusader> were trying to give links
[3:48:54] <%Javaa01> It wouldn't be possible anyways
[3:48:54] <luftraumm1> its worth reading up on the conditions because they are pretty cool
[3:48:54] <+spardanwarrior> Silenthillsmemories lists all the endings and requirements with videos
[3:48:54] <dashwallkick> nah it's fine it's cool WHAT makes you do the ending but it's not critical
[3:48:55] <DelgotHansto> The methods are interesting
[3:48:55] <+turtoh> it was how often you checked the letter/picture and drinking meds i think
[3:48:56] <%KoopaPrez> KoopaPrez subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Thanks for your content Woolie. I can always count on your voice to brighten my day when I'm feeling shit.
[3:48:58] <OblivionSword1> they have videos as well in silent hill memories
[3:48:58] <+Byr0nX> They can always gamefaqs them people.
[3:48:59] <%DocDaneeka_01> Very obtuse to go for specific endings

[3:50:35] <NireFuster> @WoolieVersus Look at the endings first
[3:50:36] <Scrapl> sub scenario is not spoiled by looking at endings

[3:50:57] <LunarRemix> This is a prequel with Maria's backstory. It only has one single ending. You can watch all the endings.

[3:50:58] <artoflec> Paaaat BabyRage
[3:51:01] <jetstreamlove_R> Born from a wish is just the perspective of the others
[3:51:02] <linSP> born from a wish gives context and I love it
[3:51:06] <+セビー> call gregstaresat
[3:51:07] <@Squdnate> It's a sub story. It's additional game content. It doesn't impact the normal story
[3:51:08] <%Onorekian> its short
[3:51:13] <R_Blaze> Call Pat for content
[3:51:14] <Darmanimon> it's just a short prequel section
[3:51:16] <shieldecho> Pat described the endings to Matt before they did Born from a Wish so I feel like looking at the other endings first is fine
[3:51:18] <jetpack_rorschasch> Content first, then endings. SeemsGood
[3:51:18] <ElBuraindo> literally a sub scenario
[3:51:21] <+ItsSunderland> I like Born from a Wish but thats because I love Maria :)
[3:51:23] <peachy996> Pretty basic, nothing really special but there are some nice tracks in it
[3:51:26] <jorniev> like how long is it ?
[3:51:27] <+Shonen_hero> Ask Pat if Maria is Gregnant

[3:52:29] <Skaab_Ruinator> @WoolieVersus Marys 7 minute long letter reading is identical in all of the endings, so skip that part
[3:52:34] <%Javaa01> @Dakuu75 Re-release
[3:52:40] <dukenux> Bogos Binted?
[3:52:45] <+ItsSunderland> Yeah the letter never changes
[3:52:49] <Darmanimon> Wait the UFO ending in this game was only in the director's cut?
[3:52:51] <+Breaknoon> Rebirth is the only one that really needs a little explaining
[3:52:51] <+brokensaint1982> *dakuu75 it was released on the PC version and the PS23 greatest hoits versions
[3:52:54] <Darren716> Perfect he's got it
[3:52:55] <NireFuster> Yep LUL it's super specific
[3:52:56] <lostallmyaccs> I'm sure Pat will say the requirements in the bpodcast
[3:52:57] <+Bitscreed> @dakuu75 Bonus content on rereleases
[3:52:59] <$RunningNGunning> @Dakuu75 There was a directors cut that also added new endings
[3:52:59] <Vex_Machina> Do not do's
[3:52:59] <Bubsla> The greatest hits was what the Dlc came with
[3:53:02] <Aussie_Manny> A whole list
[3:53:05] <%dds333a> @peachy996 expansion packs were around even before then
[3:53:05] <%shadowsofpain> The requirements are also great to see how they can happen
[3:53:07] <slackerunchained> Reggie: On-Point, as always.
[3:53:08] <Aussie_Manny> In water
[3:53:11] <Dakuu75> gotchya, thanks chat doodShake
[3:53:19] <+セビー> reggie on point
[3:53:24] <peachy996> Or you can spend an entire LP trying to be sneaky and look at the knife like Pat did
[3:53:25] <dukenux> Yep
[3:53:27] <peachy996> Kappa
[3:53:27] <Zeif00> LUL
[3:53:27] <Chatterbox1991> that might be why you got this ending
[3:53:28] <crudjandall> I got in water I guess cause I'm not a pervert LUL
[3:53:28] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:53:30] <NireFuster> Yup...
[3:53:32] <%dds333a> Punish yourself Kappa
[3:53:34] <%IronOhki> theyStab theyStab theyStab theyStab theyStab
[3:53:35] <+solzan2000> lol
[3:53:35] <Darren716> The conditions are fucking awesome
[3:53:36] <w_khan> i think the knife is what got you
[3:53:38] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's OBTUSE
[3:53:39] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL LUL
[3:53:42] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, shit is obtuse as FUCK
[3:53:42] <alikeran> oof LUL
[3:53:45] <marshalmorphino22> It was the knife
[3:53:48] <+tempestzephyr> yup kept checking the photo lol
[3:53:48] <slackerunchained> see guys? it's much MORE than simply looking at the knife.
[3:53:49] <horriblegoatdemon> James is being suicidal and not exhibiting self care
[3:53:50] <Scrapl> a confused player would be likely to get this ending
[3:53:50] <%livlinn> LUL
[3:53:51] <crudjandall> yeah it was the knife for sure
[3:53:52] <LunarRemix> Act suicidal.
[3:53:52] <skyenoz> It's basically a sliding scale of things to get the endings
[3:53:53] <dukenux> this shit's cryptic af
[3:53:53] <Darren716> yuppp
[3:53:54] <Tracazoid> Game judges your playstyle
[3:53:55] <keankong85> i hear one ending is connected to one back in SH1
[3:53:55] <Dakuu75> how do you "keep your stamina in the red" there's no stamina meter
[3:53:56] <%Rigid_Iguana> Just got here how far did they get?
[3:53:57] <+SolGainer> Which you did
[3:53:57] <kaidogs> YEP
[3:53:57] <mortificent> yeah
[3:53:57] <MattyNezz> Act like you want to die
[3:53:57] <%MyNameIsRasus> Act suicidal
[3:53:58] <+Breaknoon> it's reflective of your "behavior"
[3:53:58] <BlackermanZX> act suicidal basically
[3:54:00] <+king_of_mystery2> Gotta look at the suicide knife to get the suicide ending woolie
[3:54:01] <@Squdnate> You checked the knife a lot
[3:54:02] <+ItsSunderland> Stamina=health
[3:54:03] <DrkJP520> It's like SMT4. It's like a scale kinda
[3:54:04] <Nabs96> Lmao this is some Artorias of the Abyss dlc activation level convoluted
[3:54:04] <+healnavi> It's a scale, not a switch
[3:54:05] <Aussie_Manny> LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH
[3:54:05] <peachy996> I think it's your health and Bar+Rooftop+Hotel Room that got you there
[3:54:05] <+Mr_Pylon> All that letter and knife checking did ya in
[3:54:05] <Zeif00> Yeah you guys looked at that knife A LOT
[3:54:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Dakuu75 your health
[3:54:06] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> You did check the knife at least 4 times
[3:54:06] <lostallmyaccs> anf frick Maria LUL
[3:54:06] <+ItsSunderland> So let your health stay low
[3:54:08] <+wrxjoey> @keankong85 rebirth kinda is
[3:54:10] <+SolGainer> You were constantly checking that  KNIFE LUL
[3:54:11] <slackerunchained> Basically, focus on DEATH and THE PAST.
[3:54:11] <%RemedyofRevenge> You were looking at the knife often just like Angela
[3:54:12] <%superc37> @Dakuu75 stamina means health
[3:54:13] <%livlinn> Woolie actually never topped hp
[3:54:14] <+duskrush> Dark Souls level of obtuse
[3:54:14] <%LastHazzerd> basically... "Contemplate suicide"
[3:54:14] <NireFuster> Rebirth, Alive, and Maria
[3:54:14] <BlackermanZX> they never healed to full health
[3:54:16] <NotHereToStream> dog is the canon ending btw Kappa
[3:54:17] <linSP> act depressed
[3:54:18] <nailwind> there was a condition about pushing Maria somewhere LUL
[3:54:19] <HamFamJam> i love how the endings are pretty much how much you loved ur wife
[3:54:19] <+brokensaint1982> Silent Hill 2 does psychology BETTER that Shattered Memories
[3:54:23] <dinnydanny777> DOG UFO Rebirth, that's a sick band name
[3:54:24] <+NopeBadguy> Put simply, there's an invisible point system
[3:54:26] <mortificent> Leave is the best, I love it
[3:54:27] <jenji919> You tried using that knife a lot
[3:54:29] <mrtanaka111> gamu designea
[3:54:30] <AngryAsian5> Yeah. You checked the knife so much it was pretty easy to tell what ending you were gonna get LUL
[3:54:31] <Dakuu75> @cobalt_phoenix_ @superc37 *fucking, face palm* ok, that makes sense
[3:54:32] <jetstreamlove_R> context: don't be lore hunting if you wanna avoid that
[3:54:35] <keankong85> one leads james to harry
[3:54:35] <+Breaknoon> it's psych stuff
[3:54:36] <Darmanimon> yeah the endings work on a points system
[3:54:36] <OkamiDude15> the most common ending people will get is "leave"
[3:54:36] <agustorm123> Doggo
[3:54:38] <ElBuraindo> you didn't take care of yourself and took the most punishment, but you still accepted it
[3:54:38] <OblivionSword1> yeah the game tracks a lot of stuff
[3:54:38] <ghilbor> it's out there
[3:54:39] <GHouseduivel> G U I L T
[3:54:42] <+HalloKeyori111> Its like a personality test
[3:54:43] <jorniev> shattered memories did alright
[3:54:44] <+Jiggisnipe> don't be confused
[3:54:45] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[3:54:45] <w_khan> yep
[3:54:47] <horriblegoatdemon> It's an actual good version of Shattered Memories dude
[3:54:48] <Zap_Rowsdower32> UFO and Rebirth were added in the later version.
[3:54:51] <slackerunchained> "Leave" seems unlikely, though, considering supporting evidence.
[3:54:52] <+Jiggisnipe> be reckless
[3:54:53] <MattyNezz> You did it LUL
[3:54:54] <dukenux> You replay, knowing the walkthrough Kappa
[3:54:55] <+king_of_mystery2> that's what you did though homie
[3:54:59] <+NopeBadguy> Put simply, there's an invisible point system on certain events and actions that determines James' mental state. @WoolieVersus
[3:55:00] <+SolGainer> But you did stay in the red the whole game LUL
[3:55:00] <NireFuster> That's what you did!! LUL
[3:55:03] <+duskrush> You also need to talk to Solaire at the bar and tell Solaire that Maria has his light
[3:55:03] <Darren716> It's honestly the coolest way to do endings I've ever seen since you don't know what you're choosing
[3:55:03] <Darmanimon> Rebirth is easily the creepiest ending
[3:55:04] <peachy996> It's incredibly vague and it commonly cycles between Leave and In Water for first timers
[3:55:05] <Fuji808> The word you're lookiing for is 'Esoteric'. And I mean that in a good way. A Dark Souls way.
[3:55:06] <%itstreylar> THATS WHAT YOU DID
[3:55:06] <Zeif00> you did that tho lmao\
[3:55:07] <+Breaknoon> one of the endings it helps to wack her a few times with the pipe or whatever lol
[3:55:07] <sendart> in water is doing suicidal things
[3:55:09] <+Checktrap> Is Reggie puhing P ???
[3:55:10] <%dds333a> @drkjp520 yup, that is several SMT games
[3:55:11] <%Kriss1827> woolie thats what you rid lol
[3:55:12] <+SolidusRex> THAT'S WHAT YA DID
[3:55:13] <+Gohyakuen> you did that naturally LUL
[3:55:19] <+HalloKeyori111> You also need to join the chaos covenant
[3:55:20] <lostallmyaccs> " Why would you do it?" LUL
[3:55:26] <dashwallkick> we can't see
[3:55:28] <horriblegoatdemon> Not at all. It's just your gameplay style impacting James' mental status
[3:55:31] <+AngelYoumou> @Breaknoon Doesn't she die in one hit from james though?
[3:55:31] <Zebroneath> Dialogue from Mary/Maria before boss battle and in bedroom also changes based on the ending.
[3:55:31] <Zeif00> "Who could have done this" LUL
[3:55:32] <%MyNameIsRasus> We can't see
[3:55:33] <dukenux> Most people get In Water on their first pt
[3:55:36] <MattyNezz> This is the "Good" ending, kind of
[3:55:37] <mortificent> Leave is what most people with get
[3:55:38] <NireFuster> Nope, there's no good or bad endings
[3:55:39] <%IGgy_IGsen> I got the Leave Ending on my playthrough
[3:55:40] <w_khan> need also to meet Patches before too
[3:55:40] <+セビー> woolie confused why ppl would trigger what he did..?
[3:55:42] <%Javaa01> It is *much* more gray in SH2
[3:55:43] <Bubsla> Leave is the "good" ending
[3:55:44] <$RunningNGunning> Its not as cut and dry as SH1 as to what a Good or Bad ending is
[3:55:44] <%MyNameIsRasus> Ok
[3:55:45] <dukenux> LUL
[3:55:45] <+SolidusRex> No, there is no good ending, there is no bad ending, just endings
[3:55:46] <+Breaknoon> @AngelYoumou i think it takes like 3 or 4 with the plank
[3:55:46] <Darmanimon> there is not a good ending, really
[3:55:46] <dinnydanny777> LUL

[3:55:53] <ElBuraindo> no no, it makes sense if you play Born from a wish

[3:56:06] <OblivionSword1> impatient chat
[3:56:07] <+ItsSunderland> IMO Maria ending could be considered the BAD ending. Cause that means James didn't learn anything
[3:56:07] <Deimos002> Very excite, much anticipate
[3:56:07] <+セビー> csbeastKoopy
[3:56:08] <%BreadLM> SeemsGood
[3:56:08] <+ItalianWaifu> damn woolie actually looked at chat
[3:56:08] <NireFuster> There's no canon ending either, just endings
[3:56:08] <Darmanimon> @Darmanimon how could I forget LUL
[3:56:09] <peachy996> Oh and Woolie, Leave will have the Letter but it will be the only other ending with the letter so don't worry about time
[3:56:10] <lostallmyaccs> one man show (sorta)
[3:56:10] <shieldecho> Most people who I've seen play this for the first time got the Leave ending (never played it myself, too spooked)
[3:56:17] <+セビー> chill and get your koop on

[3:56:25] <+HalloKeyori111> In water and leave are the most common endings
[3:56:26] <dinnydanny777> debugYes
[3:56:28] <jenji919> Show content BabyRage
[3:56:28] <+Breaknoon> Leave is the closest to the good ending
[3:56:31] <%BreadLM> pachinko cutscenes???
[3:56:34] <shieldecho> @peachy996 Pretty much all of them have the letter, though...
[3:56:35] <NireFuster> best ending :)
[3:56:35] <arkv01> just leave VoHiYo
[3:56:36] <MattyNezz> A lot of it is just the letter
[3:56:38] <Macguffn> It's Robbie the Rabbit!
[3:56:39] <Darmanimon> they imply very little
[3:56:40] <nailwind> feelsgood to enjoy Silent Hill with the boys and chat :)
[3:56:41] <+Caped_Eggy> 13 mins!!
[3:56:42] <peachy996> Oh and credits
[3:56:44] <%dds333a> or course not
[3:56:44] <horriblegoatdemon> Pat's gonna have fun explaining the ending system wrong
[3:56:45] <%Onorekian> you're in silent hill? just leave 4Head
[3:56:46] <+brokensaint1982> each one has Mary reading the letter over things happening
[3:56:46] <+HalloKeyori111> They are just different outcomes
[3:56:46] <Fabpsi_> time to leave, yea!
[3:56:49] <+Borkbiff > Make sure to listen to some of the music later: there's a really nice song that was actually included in SH4
[3:56:53] <+Caped_Eggy> Oh ok credits
[3:56:54] <luftraumm1> theres just no good ending
[3:56:55] <Ozzync> from the sh2 themed pachinko
[3:56:59] <lostallmyaccs> @shieldecho First time ive seen someone get this as first ending either
[3:57:00] <Bubsla> This is the happiest non-wacky ending
[3:57:08] <peachy996> Listen to this Credits song Chat and tell me it shouldn't be on the In Water ending instead
[3:57:10] <slackerunchained> Slightly different...
[3:57:12] <NireFuster> Different dialogue PogChamp
[3:57:13] <$RunningNGunning> This dialouge is a bit different than In Water
[3:57:13] <stevenellis386> uh-oh
[3:57:14] <+DatAsuna> 10 of those minutes are credits
[3:57:16] <wotan316> @Onorekian why i didnt tjink of that
[3:57:20] <Scrapl> i think the best ending is rebirth. genuinely feels hopeful
[3:57:21] <+SolidusRex> Slightly different
[3:57:24] <crudjandall> Dog ending is representative of Mary treating James like a dog and controlling him with a switchboard
[3:57:24] <+kewlmyc> BEGONE
[3:57:27] <%MyNameIsRasus> Ever so slightly different
[3:57:30] <mortificent> Different dialogue PogChamp
[3:57:30] <+Breaknoon> the letter scroll is the same, right?
[3:57:31] <ElBuraindo> Positivest ending

[3:58:22] <Skaab_Ruinator> @WoolieVersus the letter is 100% identical in all endings so you can skip that part, she reads it for 7 MINUTES
[3:58:22] <slackerunchained> Put 'er down!
[3:58:23] <QueequegTheater> It's just been revoked

[3:59:27] <crudjandall> it's very blurry but he was holding a pillow

[3:59:42] <dinnydanny777> there's also no pillow on the bed in this scene
[3:59:44] <slackerunchained> It was deliberately unclear, but - yeah - he killed her.
[3:59:44] <ElBuraindo> sure buddy
[3:59:46] <%LastHazzerd> the dialogue is slightly different
[3:59:47] <+AngelYoumou> @WoolieVersus In the video tape, they actually cut out the sounds of Mary struggling and screaming because they thought it'd be too disturbing.
[3:59:47] <+HalloKeyori111> Dialouge is actually a little different in this ending, expect the letter is always the same
[3:59:53] <+DatAsuna> "please invent under the covers tech"
[3:59:53] <dukenux> Ooooh
[3:59:54] <Dakuu75> Esuna
[3:59:56] <linSP> Leave ending dialogue is sadder imo
[3:59:58] <ハクア> Why do you look so sad? BibleThump
[4:00:01] <Darren716> But there is a scene in the tape where you see Mary's vision and its obscured by the pillow
[4:00:04] <willyfreshness> Pillow 360 NoSAcope
[4:00:04] <Khorneflakes_> FeelsBadMan
[4:00:04] <%dds333a> she says it here
[4:00:08] <%Javaa01> It was originally supposed to be much more overt with the audio, but they decided to cut that to keep it a bit more ambiguous
[4:00:08] <Aussie_Manny> Oooh, it's different!
[4:00:10] <+SolGainer> Letter is the same
[4:00:11] <$RunningNGunning> @WoolieVersus The letter is the same you can skip it
[4:00:11] <Darmanimon> this is a long scroll btw
[4:00:12] <nailwind> change the world. my final message
[4:00:12] <restingbones> happy end
[4:00:12] <NireFuster> Leave is my personal canon one yeah, it's super good

[4:00:42] <DelgotHansto> Letter is always the same
[4:00:43] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine the strangling sounds being played while the letter was being read monkaS
[4:00:44] <+ItsSunderland> That would have done a lot of mental damage
[4:00:46] <QueequegTheater> That would NOT have flied back in the 90s
[4:00:48] <%livlinn> Yyyyyuppp
[4:00:51] <NireFuster> You made me happy... :(

[4:01:07] <umbraawitch> lets fucking GOOOO depression
[4:01:08] <MattyNezz> Mary's Letter was recorded in one take
[4:01:09] <horriblegoatdemon> God that fucking voice crack hurts my soul
[4:01:11] <puluxor> QA paranoia
[4:01:11] <StarlitStunner> tomatoPain tomatoPain
[4:01:12] <NireFuster> Credit music is different each ending tho
[4:01:14] <%Double_Tap_That> The credits music changes depending on the ending
[4:01:14] <+0neReeler> that town
[4:01:19] <+HalloKeyori111> The voice crack is sooo good
[4:01:21] <shieldecho> @MattyNezz That's awesome
[4:01:22] <Dakuu75> that's the ending Max got, I think
[4:01:22] <umbraawitch> i have now been diagnosed with sever chronic depression
[4:01:26] <nailwind> so fucking raw
[4:01:26] <stevenellis386> very interesting
[4:01:27] <jetstreamlove_R> probably the only good va
[4:01:28] <+ItsSunderland> Mary's letter is STILL some of the best damn voice acting ever done
[4:01:31] <AngryAsian5> That letter still hits hard after all these years.
[4:01:31] <%Grimlockfly> James walks with the girl here
[4:01:31] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> That final read is fucking top tier voice acting
[4:01:32] <lostallmyaccs> you mean like they did in Shattered Memories for that Erotic asphyxiation audio LUL
[4:01:32] <agustorm123> That walk
[4:01:32] <NotHereToStream> the actual voice actor cried during this reading i heard
[4:01:32] <%dds333a> @queequegtheater spending
[4:01:33] <+HalloKeyori111> Its the graveyard from the beginning
[4:01:34] <+BadassCyborg3000> The closest to a good ending right here.
[4:01:35] <ElBuraindo> don't make me cry Reggie
[4:01:36] <linSP> Did they see James and Laura
[4:01:36] <stardustcrusad3r> so is james based or cringe
[4:01:37] <NireFuster> Yep...
[4:01:37] <%Onorekian> yes
[4:01:37] <Bubsla> This is way better than the drowning ending, it was just way too depressing but cool that it was there
[4:01:38] <+Caped_Eggy> Why she walking like that?
[4:01:38] <Alzero83> Select the Gun and then Select Laura, James......
[4:01:39] <Nero270> Credits music changes based on ending
[4:01:39] <MattyNezz> ONE TAKE
[4:01:40] <+0neReeler> patch that version back
[4:01:41] <+tussletoes> this is the worst game for audio glitches since it uses silence so meticulously
[4:01:41] <slackerunchained> And... they leave! Hece the naming!
[4:01:41] <nailwind> lesso learned, chat - never fall in love :)
[4:01:41] <%DoktorZee> this isthe best end
[4:01:41] <Khorneflakes_> Yes
[4:01:42] <BlackermanZX> its amazing
[4:01:43] <oak120> it is very impactful
[4:01:44] <%LastHazzerd> where it counts!
[4:01:45] <horriblegoatdemon> She was actually crying
[4:01:45] <marshalmorphino22> Little Laura
[4:01:47] <%livlinn> There they gooo
[4:01:49] <umbraawitch> which ending did he get
[4:01:49] <Darren716> Yeah Mary/Maria's VA kills it
[4:01:49] <+Shonen_hero> Jokes on you game, I'm already depressed!
[4:01:50] <AngryAsian5> Absolutely perfect read
[4:01:51] <crudjandall> I would cry to man, that script
[4:01:51] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> It was one take
[4:01:53] <Melchior_the_Wise> The letter convinces me that the Voice acting was on purpose bad
[4:01:53] <NireFuster> This is the best ending yeah, I love it
[4:01:54] <Zap_Rowsdower32> James fulfilled Mary's wish and adopted Laura
[4:01:54] <+AngelYoumou> @WoolieVersus It was a blind read
[4:01:54] <marshalmorphino22> The voice acting for the game is fantastic
[4:01:56] <peachy996> Okay now listen to this song
[4:01:56] <DelgotHansto> The voice actress broke down after reading it
[4:01:57] <oak120> @umbraawitch  in water
[4:02:00] <Nero270> Credits ending changes based on ending
[4:02:01] <Leud_De_Grace> In Water ending... tomatoSad
[4:02:01] <hassanico2> Yeah and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Troy Baker shat all over the VAs to promote themselves LUL
[4:02:02] <ElBuraindo> "Least Bad" ending
[4:02:03] <Darmanimon> this ending is good for Laura, at least
[4:02:03] <NireFuster> James adopted Laura just like Mary would've liked to do
[4:02:03] <jetstreamlove_R> killed wife but you get to take care of kid!
[4:02:04] <w_khan> The VA actually cried reading the dialogue
[4:02:05] <%KillinYaDreamz> @Caped_Eggy  she's bowlegged lol
[4:02:05] <%LastHazzerd> oh RIGHT
[4:02:08] <Dre_> @umbraawitch in water
[4:02:09] <+korsoupp> catJAM
[4:02:09] <%dds333a> @bubsla in water is perfect
[4:02:11] <+Deano8817> SourPls
[4:02:11] <shieldecho> Yeah the implication here is that James adopted Laura like Mary wanted, so that's why most consider this the "best" ending
[4:02:11] <Aussie_Manny> That was an awesome podcast episode.
[4:02:12] <NireFuster> Yes
[4:02:12] <+solzan2000> yup

[4:02:23] <+SolidusRex> PogChamp
[4:02:23] <GHouseduivel> I'd say giving Laura a chance at happiness is the good ending
[4:02:24] <+justianxix> were purposeful
[4:02:24] <dukenux> vargDuane
[4:02:25] <+theoldone001> Maybe see if Cihi is still around? Dude is great.
[4:02:26] <Aussie_Manny> More Death Note-y.
[4:02:26] <StarlitStunner> Yeyeye
[4:02:26] <ElBuraindo> I still cry
[4:02:28] <%Javaa01> Every ending has a different song, but the video that plays is the same
[4:02:29] <Bubsla> I don't understand why people like in the water
[4:02:32] <DirigibleDPlomo> that letter read made the games staying power and imlact
[4:02:33] <+Caped_Eggy> @KillinYaDreamz Naruhodo
[4:02:34] <QueequegTheater> @theoldone001 ehhhhhh
[4:02:36] <AmazingBlanket> Song is called Overdose Delusion
[4:02:40] <Darmanimon> @theoldone001 he's now an antivax conspiracy theorist
[4:02:42] <Scrapl> why would laura want james for a dad? he admitted to her that he killed mary
[4:02:42] <umbraawitch> @Bubsla because james kills himself
[4:02:43] <%livlinn> shiaWiggle shiaWiggle shiaWiggle shiaWiggle shiaWiggle
[4:02:45] <+kibibs> But wheres Marvel?
[4:02:45] <%ChoculaUltra> oh my god does every ending have a unique banger?
[4:02:48] <peachy996> It's such a downbeat song I have no idea why they didn't use this for In Water
[4:02:53] <dukenux> For some reaons in my head i always had a cutscene of James leaving with Laura in car
[4:02:54] <jetstreamlove_R> @Skaab_Ruinator someone's salty for no reason, chill out, thank you
[4:02:56] <NireFuster> "LooOOOost?"
[4:02:58] <shieldecho> "Okay, these characters are fucking weird, so make 'em sound fucking weird, 'kay? ACTION!"
[4:03:01] <+ItsSunderland> This song is soooo good.
[4:03:02] <Supwizy> LooooOOOssst
[4:03:02] <+0neReeler> ingame = camp
[4:03:03] <nailwind> @Bubsla cus its more raw and fitting for a man thats beyond salvation
[4:03:03] <+SolGainer> Because japanese is spoken that way, very tonal
[4:03:04] <Bubsla> @umbraawitch but that's why it is the worst
[4:03:06] <%hereiam407> Loooooost?
[4:03:07] <+theoldone001> Ah shit he's Anti Vaxxer nutjob now? Damn lol nvm that sucks
[4:03:07] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus that's the same reason that Resident Evil 1 has such a fucking weird dub
[4:03:08] <QueequegTheater> @Bubsla Because James committing suicide is very in-character
[4:03:11] <+justianxix> surreal feeling in the dialogue at times
[4:03:12] <%MightyDuckShoes> Say SPARKING!
[4:03:12] <Dakuu75> was that an artistic choice? or a language-barrier thing?
[4:03:18] <crudjandall> @peachy996 I agree completely, the other track is "cool* and that's the problem
[4:03:20] <marshalmorphino22> It works well for James being mentally disturbed.
[4:03:20] <+TheMilkiestShake> Yorgos Lanthimos does that with his films The Lobster and Killing of a Sacred Deer which are both excellent imo
[4:03:20] <defaultname3887> japanese accentuation in words that are said in english basically
[4:03:21] <MattyNezz> It didn't have anything to do with Japanese, they wanted it weird IN ENGLISH
[4:03:22] <GHouseduivel> @Dakuu75 Both.
[4:03:24] <umbraawitch> @Bubsla nah hes beyond redemption
[4:03:25] <+Shonen_hero> Both I think
[4:03:25] <+HalloKeyori111> it kinda works though
[4:03:25] <Darren716> I thought that was RE?
[4:03:26] <majindusto> So great huh...No imagine all the voice  acting  sounding  like anime and James  being VA'd by Troy "NFT Bro" Baker
[4:03:27] <$RunningNGunning> It makes it feel more dream-like, whereas the letter and everything with Mary feels much more natural and real
[4:03:27] <derap41> Yeah its weird
[4:03:29] <Scrapl> @Dakuu75 combination?
[4:03:30] <defaultname3887> that looOOoost is the giveaway
[4:03:32] <+Borkbiff > I think Waiting For You is the best of the songs, even if it's technically unreleased.
[4:03:32] <Darmanimon> @Bubsla not for those that feel that is what he deserves for his actions. Not how I feel, but that's people's justification
[4:03:33] <+NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus Lani Manella talked about a similar Japanese-English voice direction discrepency for Sonic Adventure 2
[4:03:35] <Bubsla> @umbraawitch I disagree
[4:03:35] <Dakuu75> interesting
[4:03:35] <Skaab_Ruinator> @jetstreamlove_R you were being a dumbass, and you got schooled, calm down. Just listen to what Woolie is saying right now lol. The acting was intentional like that and it made the game so much better thanks to it
[4:03:36] <w_khan> @QueequegTheater but the point of his purgatory is moving on
[4:03:36] <mortificent> @Bubsla All the endings are very in character tho, and that's the best part
[4:03:40] <%robosqueeb> I dont understand why they do that. I wouldn't tell a native Japanese speaker how to speak Japanese
[4:03:41] <GurrenGyaru> Are you sure you're not getting it mized with Resident Evil?
[4:03:42] <jenji919> I think your thinking of RE1
[4:03:43] <skyenoz> was it weird on purpose?
[4:03:45] <puluxor> It's still good in its own way, the voice acting isn't "too clean"
[4:03:46] <+DatAsuna> As it had to be
[4:03:47] <QueequegTheater> @w_khan Some people can't move on
[4:03:47] <+Shonen_hero> It gives the game an identity, an almost timeless quality to it
[4:03:47] <NireFuster> Don't fight over endings guys, they're all equally plausible and all 'canon'
[4:03:48] <+セビー> language barriers were certainly a thing in RE and Shenmue
[4:03:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> Are you sure you're not talking about Resident Evil?
[4:03:53] <+korsoupp> wawaDisco wawaDisco wawaDisco
[4:03:55] <moontail95> i still enjoy the voice acting compared to others from the period
[4:03:57] <DelgotHansto> Best read in many games
[4:04:02] <umbraawitch> i like the maria ending too though
[4:04:02] <KaiserMario> Listen to this K' ost
[4:04:05] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @gurrengyaru he's not, he talked to the guy that voiced James
[4:04:05] <jetstreamlove_R> @Skaab_Ruinator not reading all that
[4:04:05] <+spookler> "And that's the end of my story..."
[4:04:06] <marshalmorphino22> @nirefuster the only true cannon ending is the dog ending
[4:04:06] <+HalloKeyori111> maria ending
[4:04:08] <%StaceMcGate> and now the WEIRD endings
[4:04:09] <ghilbor> no models to animate convincingly in multiple languages for the letter
[4:04:10] <%DoktorZee> laura gets a homee
[4:04:10] <jorniev> songs pretty good
[4:04:10] <%MyNameIsRasus> They just leave
[4:04:10] <Bubsla> I don't hate it, it's just the worst ending to get
[4:04:11] <peachy996> @crudjandall It's a good track by itself but I wouldn't use it for any other ending. In place of this song for Leave I would use "Promise" and lemme tell ya it's a great choice
[4:04:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> james adopts Laura
[4:04:11] <+ItsSunderland> Maria ending is my favorite
[4:04:12] <nailwind> its memorable voice acting and thats more important
[4:04:14] <+tussletoes> maria's va in general is great
[4:04:15] <+ItsSunderland> Cause it's SO dark
[4:04:15] <Charuzu> japanese is a syllabary instead of an alphabet (which divides things into vowels and consonants)
[4:04:15] <NireFuster> @marshalmorphino22 ... can't argue with that, you got me
[4:04:17] <+SolidusRex> He's able to live his life for himself
[4:04:18] <TalisKanju> Symphony of the Night effect with the Silent Hill HD collection?
[4:04:19] <Jickiechan> true that letter read is emotionally draining
[4:04:23] <wotan316> they just leave silent hill 4Head
[4:04:24] <%hereiam407> Exit thru the gift ahop
[4:04:24] <nyacoo> it's implying he adopts laura
[4:04:27] <mrtanaka111> dont be depressed yo

[4:04:44] <+SolGainer> Woolie looked at the knife WAY too much
[4:04:45] <mortificent> The Knife got you
[4:04:46] <crudjandall> imagine knowing the "correct" directions without a guide
[4:04:47] <Carlioo> "easiest"
[4:04:48] <%DoktorZee> you were 50% the whole game lol
[4:04:49] <agustorm123> Pondering knifeeee
[4:04:50] <QueequegTheater> Stay topped off
[4:04:51] <w_khan> the knife really got you
[4:04:51] <Timarkot> Maybe for speedrunners
[4:04:55] <+Jiggisnipe> don't be confused
[4:04:56] <Nelsukako> if you check the knife enough times, you get the water ending
[4:04:57] <%MyNameIsRasus> You examined the knife too much
[4:04:57] <%hereiam407> You killed Mary with the great knife
[4:04:58] <lostallmyaccs> Not QA proof lmao
[4:04:59] <puluxor> You get it by essentially speedrunning
[4:05:00] <Zeif00> Most people I know got this ending LUL
[4:05:00] <BlackermanZX> yeah they always were at gray health
[4:05:01] <DrkJP520> I'm glad I got the In Water ending the first time
[4:05:01] <%IronOhki> Woolie's QA thoroughness is what got us In Water.
[4:05:05] <umbraawitch> checking the diary and knife are guarantees you'll get it
[4:05:05] <linSP> Knife knife knife photo letter knife
[4:05:05] <moontail95> leave was my first ending
[4:05:05] <Aussie_Manny> do not pass Go. do not collect $200.
[4:05:08] <Acro213> Leave or In Water are the common ones
[4:05:08] <heart_ablaze> get gud basically
[4:05:08] <+NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus "Do nots" are because they put points do other endings

[4:05:19] <dukenux> Don't examine everything on your first playthrough??? EASIEST???
[4:05:22] <jenji919> Woolie got to hyped to knife things
[4:05:26] <DirigibleDPlomo> do not lab your kit lol
[4:05:26] <shieldecho> @majindusto And for a few other things...
[4:05:26] <MattyNezz> Cheer500 You are misremembering Guy Cihi's story about the VA direction. Resident Evil sounds weird because of language issues. Cihi said that they intentionally wanted it to sound a little weird and stilted, like normal people, not people with a perfect script.
[4:05:28] <umbraawitch> @majindusto his voice didnt fit james anyway
[4:05:31] <peachy996> @majindusto Oh he did that? what a jackass lol
[4:05:33] <mrtanaka111> real pat stares time
[4:05:34] <dukenux> Do not lab
[4:05:35] <slackerunchained> Taking time to enjoy the eerie ambience and atmosphere of the game is 'suicidal'... :(
[4:05:36] <+BadassCyborg3000> You had like 20 heals on you the game's quite generous.
[4:05:41] <%itstreylar> you stayed at half health most of the game

[4:05:43] <%Onorekian> yeah you save the ampules until a end-game fight like a normal human bean
[4:05:45] <wotan316> Or git gud and dont get hit
[4:05:46] <%LastHazzerd> that's partially why they don't give you proper numbers
[4:05:46] <yukichocomilk> I hate these criteria for endings
[4:05:48] <+Krasmeyts> Woolie confirmed suicidal due to f.o.m.o. D:
[4:05:49] <Darmanimon> yeah this game gives you tons of resources
[4:05:51] <+NopeBadguy> I think the game urges you towards Leave on your first playthrough
[4:05:51] <%Onorekian> DO NOT: lab
[4:05:51] <Nelsukako> you check the knife enough times woolie. That triggers the water ending
[4:05:53] <Jickiechan> @majindusto did troy legot shit talk the VO's?

[4:13:00] <%hereiam407> Reggie would boogie through Silent Hill
[4:13:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[4:13:01] <%Orcapugs> Shazam that shit
[4:13:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> @ItsSunderland there's a worse ending
[4:13:02] <ghilbor> the game ends where it begins, conveniently 👀
[4:13:02] <+0neReeler> oh no the RONA
[4:13:02] <%MyNameIsRasus> REGGIE'S COPIUM
[4:13:03] <jenji919> !woolie at risk!
[4:13:04] <dukenux> Reggie the kind of guy who'd pick Maria only to smother her again
[4:13:05] <DirigibleDPlomo> I cant believe Reggie killed Maria
[4:13:06] <dinnydanny777> This song absolutely slaps wow
[4:13:07] <%livlinn> shiaLeave shiaLeave
[4:13:07] <karawra> coping mechanism
[4:13:07] <+Bitscreed> James “What dead wife?” Sunderland

[4:13:10] <slackerunchained> In Jame's defense, Dat Ass, tho. :O
[4:13:10] <%DoktorZee> woolieF woolieT
[4:13:12] <jorniev> THIS SOOOONG
[4:13:13] <Space_Pagan> Maria ending - cycle repeats
[4:13:14] <%Javaa01> Copium leads into the cycle repeating
[4:13:14] <willyfreshness> SEVERAL area codes
[4:13:17] <ElBuraindo> lol
[4:13:17] <+Kittilot> They shouldve commissioned Theory of a Dead Man for this game. totally wouldve brought it all together
[4:13:17] <Aussie_Manny> that was actually an interesting ending
[4:13:17] <+ItsSunderland> Rebirth is also a terrible ending, but I love it :^)
[4:13:18] <peachy996> This song is beautiful and heartbreaking when it's paired with Leave Ending
[4:13:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:13:18] <dukenux> LUL
[4:13:19] <+theoldone001> When Reggie is emotionally threatened, he dafaults to spitting PHAT bars
[4:13:20] <Khorneflakes_> I really like that song
[4:13:22] <Darmanimon> James singing the Player's Anthem
[4:13:22] <mortificent> ENDLESS CYCLE
[4:13:23] <$RunningNGunning> LUL
[4:13:26] <umbraawitch> all silent hill fans have left is to fight about which ending is canon
[4:13:27] <wotan316> he stays in silent hill suffering
[4:13:31] <nailwind> I love Rebirth cus its creepy as shit
[4:13:31] <%Kungfuski> Sigma grind ending
[4:13:31] <shieldecho> That might've been my favorite SH track right there.
[4:13:32] <JeoDood> FULL circle
[4:13:32] <%MyNameIsRasus> Silent Hill manifests a new wife
[4:13:33] <+ItsSunderland> They're all canon!
[4:13:34] <dukenux> requirements: Simp Maria
[4:13:35] <Pookiedaexzile> "Bitch bet not be coughing"
[4:13:35] <DSD24> "You better do something about that cough"
[4:13:36] <+healnavi> She's just real dude
[4:13:36] <%lostcolors> better do something about that cough
[4:13:36] <%jinking79> Maria get sick in the ending
[4:13:38] <Aussie_Manny> Rewind it.
[4:13:38] <BlackermanZX> he stays in SH and h stars coughing
[4:13:39] <%superc37> magic
[4:13:39] <+0neReeler> isn't like one of the main themes
[4:13:40] <BlackLabud> Maria is sick now, too. It's penance for James that he has to relive it all over again
[4:13:40] <alikeran> he's in a loop
[4:13:41] <+wrxjoey> she's real
[4:13:41] <+duskrush> She's real but she'll get sick again
[4:13:42] <JeoDood> SHE REAL
[4:13:43] <Darren716> Maria stays real
[4:13:43] <+SolGainer> The cycle continues and maria gets sick
[4:13:43] <Make_me_mad> I love the idea that Silent Hill is just going to keep torturing him by having Maria fall ill as well.
[4:13:43] <jetstreamlove_R> Best marriage ladies n gentlemen LUL
[4:13:44] <+AngelYoumou> James went Full Circle.
[4:13:44] <wotan316> ENDLESS CYCLE
[4:13:44] <hassanico2> Silent Hill made anoter Mary but she's gonna suffer the same fate
[4:13:45] <MsYakumo> Strong implications she might have the same shit Mary had
[4:13:45] <%kyh9> It manifests as him being lost in Silent Hill forever
[4:13:50] <wotan316> Maria gets sick too
[4:13:51] <auraoftheearth009> He goes through the cycle again
[4:13:51] <peachy996> He doesn't learn.
[4:13:51] <KingOmnicide> Its a repeat it seems
[4:13:52] <+wrxjoey> she's not a delusion
[4:13:52] <superbla25> Silent Hill MAKES a new sick wife
[4:13:53] <Darmanimon> Play Born from a Wish for more context for that ending
[4:13:53] <Nelsukako> James just go full crazy. Thats the ending
[4:13:53] <marshalmorphino22> The cycle continues
[4:13:53] <hassanico2> James learned nothing
[4:13:54] <+maria_luke> the cycle repeats
[4:13:55] <+HalloKeyori111> Maria is just another silent hill monster, I guess
[4:13:55] <dinnydanny777> Well she better do something about that cough :)
[4:13:55] <+solzan2000> never ending cycle
[4:13:57] <OkamiDude15> he resets the cycle
[4:13:57] <+SolidusRex> Woolie: Silent Hill makes unreality reality
[4:14:00] <dukenux> Well... Born From the Wish kindaaaa explains that?
[4:14:00] <sgtbloopface> james essentially learned nothing, and the town punishes him for it by living the situation with mary again
[4:14:01] <Scrapl> this might get more information from born from a wish
[4:14:02] <Khorneflakes_> Silent Hill do be making it real
[4:14:03] <%hereiam407> It would be
[4:14:04] <NireFuster> Born from a wish explains this
[4:14:05] <+healnavi> Silent Hill makes shit real
[4:14:05] <+duskrush> and it IS fucked up
[4:14:05] <kaidogs> :)
[4:14:05] <auraoftheearth009> Stuck inPurgatory
[4:14:06] <ghilbor> he's gotta go through it again then
[4:14:06] <+DatAsuna> born to die
[4:14:06] <GurrenGyaru> Post credit scene
[4:14:07] <+ItsSunderland> Yeah, Maria is getting sick and James is already threatening her, so like... he's never going to learn.
[4:14:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> She's real, Silent Hill makes delusions real
[4:14:07] <mortificent> And she's sick
[4:14:08] <Vigogs> Maria is like Lisa, a "fake person" manifested into reality
[4:14:08] <+Breaknoon> maybe, born from a wish perhaps?
[4:14:10] <+DatAsuna> life is a cough
[4:14:10] <stardustcrusad3r> new silnet hill wife based
[4:14:10] <+SolidusRex> Silent Hill makes things real
[4:14:12] <wotan316> ENDLESS SICKNESS LOOP
[4:14:12] <%shadowsofpain> She then gets sick with the same disease, it's purgatory
[4:14:14] <%Kriss1827> She gets sick and the cycle begins again
[4:14:14] <MattyNezz> Almost as though she were BORN from some kind of WISH
[4:14:14] <OblivionSword1> Silent Hill is fucked up
[4:14:15] <+DatAsuna> I am dead wife
[4:14:15] <jorniev> yeah it would wouldn't it?
[4:14:16] <+ItsSunderland> He's damned himself to an endless cycle
[4:14:16] <lostallmyaccs> That's the time old question...
[4:14:17] <nailwind> no matter the ending James goes mising in Silent Hill
[4:14:17] <luftraumm1> thats got some implications on SH3
[4:14:17] <+king_of_mystery2> she also was sick woolie
[4:14:18] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Born from a Wish does answer that to some degree
[4:14:18] <+セビー> its just pure denial
[4:14:20] <Make_me_mad> Maria's a real person like Lisa Garland was. She's a monster that doesn't know what's up.
[4:14:21] <+king_of_mystery2> the copium didn't work
[4:14:21] <+0neReeler> the real ending; SH loops
[4:14:21] <Cherokia666> She gets TP again. The coughing you were laughing through
[4:14:22] <+Automated_Pixel> Shes sick too.
[4:14:22] <majindusto> Gotta play Born from a Wish
[4:14:23] <Ozzync> did they no hear the coughing?
[4:14:25] <hartounian> He learned nothing
[4:14:25] <Skaab_Ruinator> She is a real, physical being, but conjured by Silent Hill into existence
[4:14:26] <+Bitscreed> Think Lisa from SH1
[4:14:26] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Infinite Illness Works
[4:14:27] <%RemedyofRevenge> Maria has some real Trish vibes. "I'm not *your* Mary, James."
[4:14:27] <+TwitchGuy2021> The last line implies James repeats the cycle.
[4:14:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is Silent Hill an ENEMY STAND?
[4:14:28] <Space_Pagan> She's sick too
[4:14:28] <jetpack_rorschasch> I think he just stays in Silent Hill with her forever. That's what I got from it.
[4:14:29] <%kyh9> Yep.  He basically stays in SH forever
[4:14:29] <linSP> born from a wish
[4:14:30] <Blank9> silent hill's had potara earring fusion devils, nothing's impossible
[4:14:30] <NireFuster> Yep, just like Angela does, you can't escape the town
[4:14:32] <%SouLucha> Think about wife, new wife, cough, regret.
[4:14:32] <dashwallkick> Silent Hill makes things real but it's ambiguous enough you can pick either or
[4:14:35] <+Kittilot> me chilling in a psychological hell but i got my bitch back so 🙄 haters stay mad
[4:14:35] <+GrayMatterMiner> i mean, it's both mental shit and magic
[4:14:37] <dukenux> @Vigogs Lisa was real tho? She was just caught into Alyssa's new reality
[4:14:38] <%livlinn> Shits fucked
[4:14:38] <+solzan2000> monkey paw
[4:14:40] <plaguedoctor_vi> I think it like that Catharine Ending where Vincent being delusional
[4:14:42] <+0neReeler> you coming back to SH
[4:14:43] <+ItsSunderland> Yeah that's not a happy ending by any means.
[4:14:45] <+korsoupp> max derrant has a good video about maria
[4:14:50] <jetstreamlove_R> Silent Hill is the worst Eldritch therapist by far
[4:14:51] <Pookiedaexzile> "Better get that cough checked out"
[4:14:51] <peachy996> Yeah that's a chilling line
[4:14:51] <DelgotHansto> Love is the only escape from Silent Hill (unironically?)
[4:14:53] <%RemedyofRevenge> Her name isn't Mary, its Lady.
[4:14:54] <%LastHazzerd> Reggie's bit distracted woolie
[4:14:55] <dukenux> Ever read Solaris?
[4:14:57] <BlackermanZX> Maria will get a disease and James will kill her again
[4:15:01] <dashwallkick> reggie killed the stinger lmao
[4:15:01] <lostallmyaccs> Silent Hill fusing monsters at the gallows

[4:15:02] <dukenux> or watched the movie?
[4:15:06] <+GrayMatterMiner> silent hill can totally spawn real people, the thing is as she leaves its clear she's sick, she wont survive for long
[4:15:06] <slackerunchained> Marche heads into Silent Hill to yank James out of it. :P
[4:15:08] <Cherokia666> you were having a Reggie moment through this scene
[4:15:11] <Darmanimon> @Pookiedaexzile no it's "you better do something about that cough"
[4:15:13] <+0neReeler> SH is pretty good at being matchmaker
[4:15:14] <BlackLabud> It's also a very threatening line
[4:15:15] <MattyNezz> James still hates himself, so his love still has to die
[4:15:22] <ghilbor> before reg started dropping bard
[4:15:24] <NireFuster> It's a very aggressive line
[4:15:26] <+DatAsuna> He wanted a do over and he got it
[4:15:30] <+HalloKeyori111> Silent Hill can bring your waifu to life!
[4:15:30] <Bubsla> Pete's Bowl O RAMA
[4:15:34] <+korsoupp> monkaS
[4:15:35] <NireFuster> ''YOU better do something about that cough...''
[4:15:35] <dukenux> monkaS
[4:15:35] <ghilbor> bars, even
[4:15:36] <+Breaknoon> the cycle begins again
[4:15:37] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Kappa
[4:15:37] <+ItsSunderland> Just a chilling line, honestly.
[4:15:37] <Alzero83> The Cycle continues ending @WoolieVersus
[4:15:38] <NotHereToStream> oh no
[4:15:38] <+DatAsuna> Sick wife 2
[4:15:38] <Dr_Mooose> monkaS
[4:15:39] <derap41> Whelp shit
[4:15:39] <%ChoculaUltra> @slackerunchained the real 12 year old dream reality crushing mc silent hill needs LUL
[4:15:40] <dinnydanny777> monkaS
[4:15:40] <peachy996> Not "You should get that cough looked at" no it's "You'd better do something about that cough"
[4:15:41] <%kyh9> Very threatening
[4:15:42] <%holydeviant1> Gentle threat
[4:15:42] <DSD24> Copium
[4:15:43] <marshalmorphino22> Sick
[4:15:43] <+ItsSunderland> He's gonna fucking kill her again
[4:15:44] <stevenellis386> that covid
[4:15:46] <QueequegTheater> monkaS
[4:15:47] <jetstreamlove_R> The cycle begins anew!
[4:15:47] <dukenux> the way James said that line sends chills down my spine
[4:15:48] <+Borkbiff > Menacing
[4:15:48] <shieldecho> Meet the new anime mom disease, same as the old anime mom disease. Which is the point.
[4:15:48] <Ozzync> implying she is going to die soon
[4:15:48] <Scrapl> James "no Im not going to the doctor with you" Sunderland
[4:15:50] <+korsoupp> ILL DO IT AGAIn
[4:15:53] <lostallmyaccs> @MattyNezz Thats deep, I dont even understand it fully
[4:15:54] <BlackLabud> He learns nothing and the cycle continues
[4:15:54] <Space_Pagan> That sounded like a threat
[4:15:55] <umbraawitch> better do something about that cough or else i'll take out the pillow
[4:15:56] <+DatAsuna> @peachy996 "This is a threat"
[4:15:57] <+0neReeler> SH survives: the ending
[4:15:58] <Nelsukako> the way james says that.....jesus
[4:15:58] <jorniev> SECOND WIFE ALSO SICK
[4:15:59] <%jinking79> 'You'd' not 'We'
[4:15:59] <Darmanimon> fucking heartless from James
[4:15:59] <AngryAsian5> The way he says it too
[4:15:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> stop coughing i'll kill you
[4:16:00] <Make_me_mad> James will do it again and get a new Maria. Straight up.
[4:16:02] <%shadowsofpain> New wife same disease, it's a loop
[4:16:02] <wotan316> Diavolo Loop of wife getting sick
[4:16:04] <marshalmorphino22> @space_pagan sounded?
[4:16:07] <majindusto> It just keeps  Happening
[4:16:07] <Khorneflakes_> Silent Hill is WILL pull Harry back in, over and over with that ending!
[4:16:09] <%lostcolors> maria will get sick just like her
[4:16:09] <+Kittilot> James...James...James...
[4:16:10] <Vigogs> @dukenux there was a Lisa, but the one in the game is Alessa's idealized version of her, created to be different from the real her because Alessa saw her as a nice nurse who took care of her
[4:16:12] <nailwind> Leave is probably the least canon ending cus James goes missing anyways
[4:16:16] <restingbones> Dont get sick new wife, or Ill kill ya
[4:16:16] <+korsoupp> james is a big piece of shit
[4:16:17] <Melchior_the_Wise> James is just attracted to terminally ill women
[4:16:19] <shieldecho> Wonder how many times this has already happened...
[4:16:19] <%SouLucha> WIFE COUGH BACK
[4:16:20] <NotHereToStream> a shotgun is a good cure for the cough - James, probably
[4:16:20] <lostallmyaccs> Silent Hill Requiem
[4:16:20] <+brokensaint1982> showing that James learned ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in Silent Hill
[4:16:23] <jetstreamlove_R> Cause they the same person!
[4:16:24] <oak120> Purgatory
[4:16:25] <%shadowsofpain> Diavolo is actually a great allusion
[4:16:31] <%MightyDuckShoes> SigmaGrindset James. "You with me until you harsh my buzz"
[4:16:33] <NireFuster> Rebirth ending now?
[4:16:33] <+GrayMatterMiner> woolie seems to have a hard time internalizing that things can leave silent hill, while still being under the effects of it
[4:16:33] <umbraawitch> EXTREME COPE
[4:16:35] <jorniev> you better check that cough sees also threatening
[4:16:36] <+0neReeler> time to BOOST
[4:16:37] <+HalloKeyori111> How do you get the maria ending?
[4:16:38] <+solzan2000> delusion is a B
[4:16:38] <Nabs96> time is convoluted in Silent Hill
[4:16:39] <+Bitscreed> *James grabs pillow* “You’d better do something about that cough.”
[4:16:41] <+Jiggisnipe> idk, seems like he's get that shit fixed not i'm concerned lol
[4:16:42] <DSD24> Cypher
[4:16:46] <slackerunchained> Dog Ending?
[4:16:46] <+healnavi> Reunion is the REAL cope ending
[4:16:47] <Pookiedaexzile> I Wanna be Important

[4:16:50] <Darmanimon> put me back where you find me
[4:16:50] <Scrapl> ignorance is bliss
[4:16:52] <stevenellis386> what a thriller
[4:16:52] <umbraawitch> @HalloKeyori111 stay close to maria, check on her in the hospital, and make sure she doesnt get hurt
[4:16:53] <jetstreamlove_R> Straight up Over Heaven that ending LUL
[4:16:53] <dinnydanny777> Also seems like the ending where James is the absolute biggest piece of shit
[4:16:54] <lostallmyaccs> Plug me back into the matrix
[4:16:55] <marshalmorphino22> @bitscreed *cocks pillow*
[4:16:57] <%RemedyofRevenge> Silent Hill is a automatic Stand
[4:16:58] <%shadowsofpain> Woolie James will never reach the truth
[4:16:58] <+ItsSunderland> Rebirth is based
[4:16:59] <Eger007> plug me the fuck back

[4:17:38] <Pablox010> Bowling alley
[4:17:39] <umbraawitch> when i was getting the maria ending i checked on her like 20 times in the hospital
[4:17:39] <+GrayMatterMiner> "i dont remember" lol
[4:17:40] <+Bitscreed> Don’t make her tell you twice! :D
[4:17:41] <%MyNameIsRasus> Don't loiter
[4:17:41] <dashwallkick> it's saying "Don't loiter" not "A or B"
[4:17:44] <%Javaa01> Not from a story perspective, but gameplay
[4:17:44] <sgtbloopface> when you ask where the hotel is when you first see her, she points you the wrong way
[4:17:45] <NireFuster> You gotta 100% follow her words
[4:17:45] <zedravan> Bowling Alley
[4:17:45] <linSP> I’ve gotta find her!
[4:17:46] <BlackLabud> like before the hospital when you spot Laura
[4:17:47] <+AngelYoumou> When Laura ran away?
[4:17:50] <%Kriss1827> the bowling alley
[4:17:52] <BlackLabud> or the bowling alley
[4:17:53] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe skip the bowling alley
[4:17:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> You stop to look around for items and search every room, remember?
[4:17:57] <%Prevot> bark for maria
[4:17:58] <%itstreylar> chasing after laura
[4:18:00] <+kraajkase> When you're going after Laura
[4:18:04] <+0neReeler> how to move on
[4:18:07] <majindusto> She hates it
[4:18:07] <+GrayMatterMiner> and she stayed behind
[4:18:07] <mortificent> go after Laura
[4:18:08] <nyacoo> she waits outside
[4:18:08] <%Javaa01> She doesn't wanna go to the bowling alley
[4:18:08] <Jickiechan> James is tier 3 subbed to maria
[4:18:10] <+Jiggisnipe> you don't have to go there?
[4:18:10] <+brokensaint1982> Dont bump into her dont be aggressive with her
[4:18:11] <dashwallkick> if you don't run after laura immediately she chides you
[4:18:12] <+maria_luke> stay @ the bowling alley
[4:18:12] <nailwind> Maia Makima
[4:18:12] <%Javaa01> It's skippable
[4:18:15] <Azmodem> When was the last time you Bowled
[4:18:18] <+0neReeler> SIMPING
[4:18:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> She waits outside, it's skippable
[4:18:19] <MattyNezz> Laura runs away, Maria tells you to go after her, and you can go in the wrong direction
[4:18:20] <+SkitsofRandom> when laura runs off maria says "she went that way" and if you don't chase IMMEDIATELY she gets mad
[4:18:21] <Melchior_the_Wise> when you leave the bowling alley, you don't explore, you just go down by the gate
[4:18:21] <crudjandall> I think spending extra time in the strip club effects something but I don't remember
[4:18:23] <zedravan> it was a detour you plan was to go to another place
[4:18:24] <%shadowsofpain> what if you don't go there or don't immediately follow Laura
[4:18:25] <ghilbor> you can go to the far edge of town before the alley, thats where she tells you to go
[4:18:27] <jenji919> She hates bowling
[4:18:28] <jetpack_rorschasch> She avoided the Bowling Ally.
[4:18:28] <+healnavi> the hotel
[4:18:31] <MattyNezz> The right way
[4:18:33] <Pablox010> To look for laura
[4:18:34] <%Onorekian> she wanted to find laura
[4:18:35] <+HalloKeyori111> directly to the hotel
[4:18:38] <%itstreylar> she wanted you to go after laura you went the wrong way
[4:18:39] <%Javaa01> Straight to the objective
[4:18:40] <mortificent> the hotel
[4:18:44] <Scrapl> i don't think you can skip the bowling alley
[4:18:44] <%PunishedBuck> The Hotel
[4:18:45] <+AngelYoumou> She wanted you to chase after Laura IMMEDIATELY
[4:18:48] <%Kriss1827> straight to objective
[4:18:52] <+DatAsuna> you gotta get in there
[4:18:56] <%PunishedBuck> you find a broken road
[4:18:57] <puluxor> don't explore
[4:18:57] <Zap_Rowsdower32> You also can get if you check up on here a bunch in the hospital room
[4:18:59] <Darren716> The goal is the Hotel but you get diverted to the hospital because of Laura
[4:18:59] <%Javaa01> Crit path only
[4:19:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's "straight to objective, do not explore"
[4:19:01] <peachy996> You can go to the Motel and you can reach the Historical Society early and get told to go back
[4:19:02] <+DatAsuna> elbow deep, immediately
[4:19:10] <horriblegoatdemon> The endings are more about judging your playstyle and deriving James' psychology from it. It's like a smarter and less in-your-face way of what Shattered Memories made a bullet point for marketing
[4:19:11] <NireFuster> Yeah it's very specific stuff you can't get all endings by acting the same way
[4:19:18] <+0neReeler> dreaded progression only
[4:19:19] <NireFuster> You can't explore everything and get different endings
[4:19:20] <peachy996> and enemies are launched at you from the side of the road
[4:19:21] <DSD24> Suffer like G did
[4:19:22] <+healnavi> These endings aren't straightforward
[4:19:33] <chadoinkle> what ending did wollie get first?
[4:19:34] <MattyNezz> Literally just stand there
[4:19:36] <slackerunchained> PH deaths dont count for her...
[4:19:37] <umbraawitch> getting the maria ending is easier than it sounds
[4:19:37] <+SolGainer> stand in the room
[4:19:38] <%Javaa01> Stay in the room with her
[4:19:39] <chadoinkle> I assume its the one most get
[4:19:39] <Darren716> The room where she sleeps
[4:19:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> @chadoinkle in Water
[4:19:42] <Darmanimon> the one where she feels sick
[4:19:43] <+Breaknoon> hospital room
[4:19:49] <crudjandall> "become aegis reflector in Pyramid Head hallway"
[4:19:51] <marshalmorphino22> Watch her sleep off her hangover
[4:19:56] <+Kittilot> theyre not supposed to be something you can do like, intentionally
[4:19:58] <dashwallkick> S3 is the Silenthill Snake Simulation
[4:20:03] <chadoinkle> @Melchior_the_Wise Wow reall? You usually have to go out of your way to get that one
[4:20:12] <+ItsSunderland> My theory: Maria doesnt enter the bowling alley cause James subconsciously knows she isnt real and doesnt want anyone inside to confront him over the fact that he's divorced from reality
[4:20:13] <%KellBeII> no, you totally tried to reenter
[4:20:15] <Darmanimon> ignore wife

[4:23:17] <+Ancopro> don't skip content
[4:23:25] <nyacoo> DO: Lab
[4:23:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> Use =/= Examine
[4:23:26] <%kyh9> The content makes him suicidal

[4:23:27] <MattyNezz> And refuse to heal

[4:23:28] <KingOmnicide> yep LUL
[4:23:30] <dukenux> Try to get the most out of the game = suicide
[4:23:30] <+DatAsuna> woolie confirmed suicidal
[4:23:32] <BlackLabud> Tbh, people were hinting at that ending and pushing you to get it lol
[4:23:33] <Frampis> how to get dog ending?
[4:23:33] <emper0rner0> That's the in water ending is considered the most canon to some
[4:23:34] <+HalloKeyori111> explore, optimize heals and look at knife
[4:23:34] <peachy996> The Green Health is what got you
[4:23:37] <linSP> Content = suicide
[4:23:40] <ElBuraindo> this ending is too much of a trap
[4:23:42] <+Bitscreed> There is some content man was not mean to know, Woolie
[4:23:44] <nailwind> immerse yourself into suicide :)
[4:23:46] <+solzan2000> boom
[4:23:49] <%KellBeII> in water is the intended ending for the game.
[4:23:50] <skyshinecrusader> minmaxing=suicide
[4:23:51] <alikeran> ooooohhhh
[4:23:54] <jorniev> the in water ending?
[4:23:54] <crudjandall> @cappuccinoguil no I think it was because he had over 100 ammo :D
[4:23:55] <+Jiggisnipe> don't save Angela LUL
[4:23:55] <+king_of_mystery2> Really all you have to do is stay in green to avoid it

[4:23:56] <peachy996> You never knew Full Health is a Green Status Screen

[4:24:00] <GHouseduivel> Ah hot

[4:24:01] <%MyNameIsRasus> In Water is canon anyway, it's fine

[4:24:02] <mat2501> THAT is copium
[4:24:02] <+HalloKeyori111> Well one ending is not worse than the other
[4:24:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, you using the pipe meant you took a lot of damage
[4:24:03] <OuendanCyrus> I got Leave ending the first time, and I pretty much always get it playing normally.
[4:24:03] <Leud_De_Grace> you forgot the angela rant LUL
[4:24:05] <+healnavi> Bullying Pyramid Head caused this
[4:24:05] <dashwallkick> wanting to follow her is exactly the thing that is suicidal woolie!!!
[4:24:05] <+BadassCyborg3000> Entire game explains how you can't help her. Woolie: BUT LET ME SAVE HER.
[4:24:06] <Aussie_Manny> Fire Walk With Me
[4:24:06] <BlackermanZX> fire was indeed too hot
[4:24:07] <%dds333a> That's what I did, just TO SEE
[4:24:08] <puluxor> explore content and take a lot of damage, very typical for anyone's first playthrough, no?
[4:24:09] <hassanico2> Time for NG+ endings!
[4:24:09] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Biggest thing is health and Angela's knife. Exploring can still get you Leave.
[4:24:10] <marshalmorphino22> You need water to put out the fire
[4:24:11] <BlackLabud> There is no canon ending, that's a myth
[4:24:11] <NireFuster> There is no canon ending, In Water is not canon
[4:24:12] <Dakuu75> she had more fire resist, than you
[4:24:12] <Scrapl> dog ending: key in doghouse leads to secret room in hotel
[4:24:19] <%Kriss1827> you never healed to full health lol
[4:24:20] <%Onorekian> LUL
[4:24:21] <+Jiggisnipe> THANK YOU
[4:24:22] <linSP> Perfect score for in water
[4:24:22] <%LastHazzerd> you're too meta
[4:24:24] <Space_Pagan> LUL
[4:24:27] <%Javaa01> You're not looking after yourself
[4:24:28] <jorniev> ARE YOU?
[4:24:29] <+DenpaDev> not for james
[4:24:30] <alikeran> you can't save health items when you are dead LUL
[4:24:32] <%MightyDuckShoes> Everything in Silent Hill is kind of gesturing for you to off yourself.
[4:24:32] <MattyNezz> You really weren't, you never got close to full health after the first time it dropped LUL
[4:24:32] <NireFuster> The writers specifically say that no ending is the ''true'' ending
[4:24:33] <Dr_Mooose> what if you need them later game!
[4:24:33] <+Jiggisnipe> it's called being efficient
[4:24:33] <crudjandall> he also ended game with like 10 V8 juices
[4:24:34] <+Ancopro> goblins gonna kill ya
[4:24:36] <horriblegoatdemon> For James it's a lack of self-care
[4:24:36] <%LastHazzerd> "oh you're a gamer? you know what you should do?"
[4:24:38] <marshalmorphino22> But are you? Are you ok Woolie?
[4:24:40] <ghilbor> no health care ending
[4:24:41] <%Grimlockfly> U should treat yourself better, woolie
[4:24:42] <+duskrush> You min maxed into suicide
[4:24:44] <slackerunchained> "But what if I NEED it LATER?"
[4:24:44] <dukenux> @puluxor yea. why i think "Leave" being the most common ending is bullshit
[4:24:45] <Scrapl> irl you wanna keep yourself near full health as much as possible
[4:24:45] <+GrayMatterMiner> yes, this was a trap for people who save items
[4:24:46] <+pectusumbra> So the game got finished
[4:24:47] <%MyNameIsRasus> Oh yeah 100%
[4:24:56] <@Solidus_113> you think this is a VIDEO GAME?
[4:24:58] <BlackLabud> It's more about the game reading James' mental state into your playstyle
[4:24:58] <VincentGraves> there's no sequel to this game,don't know why people think there's a canon ending
[4:24:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> Rebirth ending is probably the worst
[4:24:59] <%RemedyofRevenge> Woolie is out here labbing suicide
[4:25:00] <%LastHazzerd> it's totally designed for multiple replays
[4:25:00] <holyxgrale> The character you're controlling is suicidal because you're a completionist PogChamp
[4:25:01] <NireFuster> THIS IS REAL LIFE
[4:25:02] <mortificent> Leave and In Water are very natural
[4:25:03] <+HalloKeyori111> What if I missed sometihng though???

[4:29:28] <Space_Pagan> No need for letter if she's back LUL
[4:29:30] <peachy996> This is kinda like a SH4 track
[4:29:30] <%oneimportantthing> Did we watch THAT ending yet?
[4:29:31] <jorniev> IT PROBABLY WORKED TOO
[4:29:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> IS 2 A FUCKING PREQUEL?
[4:29:32] <DrkJP520> Mary is back to Rise
[4:29:32] <skyshinecrusader> He's bringing her back
[4:29:33] <+Borkbiff > Which is why it's NG+
[4:29:33] <nailwind> CTHULHU GETS DOWN
[4:29:34] <puluxor> Literally need to collect items and lore that only appear on NG+ run
[4:29:34] <%Onorekian> its more of a personal journey
[4:29:35] <dashwallkick> this ending is New Game +, you can't get it your first time
[4:29:36] <+BadassCyborg3000> That's why it's a bonus non-canonical ending
[4:29:36] <%livlinn> forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry
[4:29:36] <umbraawitch> @CrimsonGargoyle no
[4:29:36] <dinnydanny777> Maybe that's why he went to Silent Hill :)
[4:29:37] <+SolGainer> @oneimportantthing no
[4:29:37] <GHouseduivel> Don't need to read a final letter, if there is no final :)
[4:29:39] <+king_of_mystery2> read the requirements and it makes sense
[4:29:39] <Darmanimon> @oneimportantthing no dog no UFO
[4:29:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> in NG+ there's extra stuff you collect that refers to the cult
[4:29:43] <Make_me_mad> In New Game + there's shit talking about resurrection.
[4:29:43] <%townzzzzz> NOW FOR THE BEST ENDINGS
[4:29:44] <Darren716> @WoolieVersus In ng+ there are extra items that explain the occult shit
[4:29:46] <+maria_luke> 2 is not a prequel
[4:29:46] <+Breaknoon> gotta do what ya gotta do
[4:29:46] <Scrapl> items don't appear until NG+ right?
[4:29:48] <BlackLabud> No final letter if there is no finality
[4:29:48] <peachy996> This track reminds me of some songs off The Room
[4:29:51] <ghilbor> its all from 6 ng+ ritual items
[4:29:51] <NireFuster> Also, absolute BANGER of a song
[4:29:55] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus NG+ adds items to the environment that reference the cult stuff
[4:29:55] <+Breaknoon> @Scrapl Yea
[4:29:56] <Jickiechan> I don't know if you noticed but mary/marias corpse was in the boat too
[4:29:57] <+SolidusRex> Only two endings left, the BEST ENDINGS
[4:29:58] <+Jiggisnipe> oof
[4:29:58] <marshalmorphino22> Mary can write him a new letter when he brings her back
[4:30:00] <%MyNameIsRasus> In New Game+ there's occultism references
[4:30:00] <crudjandall> @peachy996 I really hope they get to 4 at some point
[4:30:02] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yeah, the items don't show up until NG+
[4:30:05] <mortificent> OH GOD THAT ISSUE
[4:30:05] <dukenux> 2 is entirely self contained story
[4:30:08] <slackerunchained> "Nothing Special." - James about Jesus, probably
[4:30:09] <linSP> time for IT WAS ME AUSTIN
[4:30:09] <%dds333a> and one has a life and a family
[4:30:09] <%superc37> OH GOD THIS SONG

[4:30:43] <+DatAsuna> shadow clone no justsu
[4:30:43] <+Breaknoon> Yeah, it's super dark
[4:30:44] <peachy996> This is Laura's voice backwards
[4:30:48] <+ItsSunderland> FUn fact: the reversed dialogue is Laura reading the prayer "now I lay me down to sleep"
[4:30:49] <Darmanimon> Eraserhead Baby
[4:30:50] <Aussie_Manny> comics were a mistake.
[4:30:51] <Nero270> This is a new game plus only ending. The game generates items for you to pick up that flesh out the occult stuff that you have to pick up to get the ending
[4:30:52] <+Shonen_hero> UNBIRTH
[4:30:53] <OkamiDude15> but woolie she is real :)
[4:30:53] <dinnydanny777> Real fake baby
[4:30:54] <mortificent> Cheryl
[4:30:58] <Overloard> tiny PH
[4:31:00] <%G_Thunders> Does Woolie know about the Maria dlc?
[4:31:02] <+GrayMatterMiner> maria is "real" in the same way as the multiple man baby being a physical thing
[4:31:05] <mortificent> Cheryl comes out of that
[4:31:05] <wotan316> SH1 baby
[4:31:06] <+0neReeler> unbirth (under night)
[4:31:07] <Darmanimon> @G_Thunders yes
[4:31:07] <%Onorekian> James will figure it out
[4:31:09] <NireFuster> @G_Thunders yes but they're doing the endings first
[4:31:09] <bassoontyphoon> Anne Coulter would come out
[4:31:10] <+Shonen_hero> man, not gonna multiply even once
[4:31:11] <crackedhappiness> so far it seems water ending is the best one somehow
[4:31:11] <+GrayMatterMiner> she's not a real person tho
[4:31:13] <%LastHazzerd> then doin't play SH
[4:31:16] <iswearimjustdandy> Shut up chat spoiling
[4:31:16] <Fuji808> !uptime
[4:31:17] <@Moobot> @Fuji808 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 46 minutes
[4:31:22] <dybia> Its implied Maria was some unrelated woman that had Mary's image plastered onto her by reality
[4:31:24] <slackerunchained> She gives birth to a LiveDoll.
[4:31:25] <+SolidusRex> DOG ENDING
[4:31:26] <+Jiggisnipe> check the requirements for that ending

[4:31:37] <Macguffn> Dog Ending!
[4:31:43] <StarlitStunner> D O G
[4:31:44] <crudjandall> "how'd they go from Anne Hathaway to Anne Coulter"
[4:31:44] <Darmanimon> "real" is relative
[4:31:46] <OkamiDude15> "real"
[4:31:47] <Darren716> Ehhhh
[4:31:47] <%oneimportantthing> Man all the crypto bros are gonna cream themselves
[4:31:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> Fair
[4:31:48] <%dds333a> Nah, she aint Kappa
[4:31:48] <MattyNezz> She's real in the sense that she takes up physical space
[4:31:48] <+GrayMatterMiner> """"""""""REAL""""""""
[4:31:49] <mortificent> Cheryl
[4:31:49] <AngryAsian5> "Real"
[4:31:50] <derap41> Silent Hill Maria might not be real
[4:31:50] <+NopeBadguy> It's up to player interpretation
[4:31:52] <+korsoupp> shes a figment of jame's imagination and the town
[4:31:52] <%G_Thunders> “See James, I’m real.”
[4:31:53] <+Shonen_hero> that's fair
[4:31:53] <+0neReeler> what is "REAL"
[4:31:54] <Bubsla> It's open to interpretation
[4:31:54] <Darren716> I'd say she's physical
[4:31:54] <+Jiggisnipe> tbf she died 3 times
[4:31:55] <+SolidusRex> Silent Hill makes things real\
[4:31:55] <+ItsSunderland> She's real to James :^)
[4:31:56] <jenji919> Dog ending guys
[4:31:56] <%shadowsofpain> She's as real as Silent Hill
[4:31:56] <mortificent> CHERYL IS THE EVIDENCE
[4:31:56] <GHouseduivel> As real as the monsters
[4:31:56] <BlackermanZX> she is """real"""
[4:31:56] <peachy996> surprised out of all the voice cast in SH2/SH3 only Donna Burke went on to continue doing stuff
[4:31:57] <BlackLabud> She's ''real''
[4:31:57] <wotan316> silent is real
[4:31:57] <+brokensaint1982> She is a FLESH GOLEM
[4:31:57] <+Ancopro> real*tm
[4:31:59] <%GameFreakerZero> Yeah it's kind of an interpretive 'real' is how I always took it
[4:31:59] <NireFuster> She's ''real'' in the same way the monsters are ''real''
[4:32:00] <yukichocomilk> no she's not LUL
[4:32:00] <dashwallkick> she's "real" because everything in Silent HIll is "real"
[4:32:01] <%superc37> SILENT HILL MAGIC WOOLIE
[4:32:01] <marshalmorphino22> She’s real
[4:32:02] <kaidogs> well, its complicated
[4:32:03] <dukenux> "She's real to ME"
[4:32:04] <%DocDaneeka_01> Woolie be like: <citation needed>
[4:32:04] <dinnydanny777> Define "reality" :)
[4:32:05] <@Squdnate> "Real"
[4:32:06] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:32:06] <OblivionSword1> Silent Hill is a weird place anything can happens
[4:32:06] <%BreadLM> SH used another woman to make Maria
[4:32:06] <derap41> There might be a real Maria outside of Silent Hill
[4:32:07] <ElBuraindo> just play damnit
[4:32:07] <%GameFreakerZero> Real depending on the player
[4:32:07] <+GrayMatterMiner> she is a physical body, technically
[4:32:08] <NireFuster> IT'S REAL TO ME
[4:32:09] <bassoontyphoon> Real in the same way of “Lars and the real girl”
[4:32:10] <+king_of_mystery2> What makes you think just because she is of silent hill means she isn't real.
[4:32:11] <dybia> Its all implications either way, we don't know
[4:32:11] <+maria_luke> Yes, and that's real. The town is supernatural.
[4:32:11] <%Grimlockfly> And what’s Silent Hill, woolie?
[4:32:14] <Khorneflakes_> Silent Hill is an ILLOGICAL place
[4:32:15] <agustorm123> But kinda not
[4:32:16] <+GrayMatterMiner> real with MASSIVE air quotes
[4:32:17] <BlackLabud> It's unclear to what extent she is real
[4:32:18] <Scrapl> the fact that she has a point of view, and lives separately from james makes her seem real
[4:32:18] <%ChoculaUltra> gets murked a lot actually LUL
[4:32:18] <%Prevot> she's real, REAL HOT
[4:32:19] <+Bitscreed> The town makes it real
[4:32:19] <+0neReeler> the silent hill dimension
[4:32:20] <yukichocomilk> chat stuck in silent hill LUL
[4:32:20] <DSD24> "You're feelings for her aren't real" THEY ARE REAL TO ME
[4:32:20] <Macguffn> Dumbledoor: "Why of course it's all in your head, but why would that make it any less real?"
[4:32:20] <DrkJP520> Is this just a "Born From a Wish makes her real?"
[4:32:21] <%KellBeII> Woolie, you need to play the second mode to understand maria
[4:32:23] <AngryAsian5> "Real" In the loosest sense of the term, I suppose. LUL
[4:32:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think there might be a real Maria somewhere, but not that one
[4:32:25] <ghilbor> nobody but james ever sees her, so eh
[4:32:26] <+Breaknoon> fakewife
[4:32:26] <mortificent> but yeah Dream Lynchian Logic
[4:32:27] <OblivionSword1> nothing makes sense in silent hill
[4:32:27] <peachy996> It's a very fair assumption woolie
[4:32:29] <+wrxjoey> SHE IS REAL TO ME
[4:32:30] <KingOmnicide> Maria#4 is totally real man
[4:32:30] <zedravan> it is a fake real wife
[4:32:30] <agsiar2> heyo
[4:32:30] <+SolidusRex> IT IS FUCKED UP
[4:32:31] <+Jiggisnipe> is it tho?
[4:32:32] <nyacoo> is she basically james' tulpa?
[4:32:32] <umbraawitch> i think trying to pick it apart will ruin the mystery of silent hill
[4:32:35] <%shadowsofpain> She is "real", just like James dying is a real death
[4:32:35] <lostallmyaccs> Hold that thought
[4:32:36] <iswearimjustdandy> Silent hill is not a place
[4:32:36] <slackerunchained> For a given definition of 'real'...
[4:32:36] <MattyNezz> Real fake people
[4:32:37] <VAYETEAS> Maria belongs on the streets
[4:32:40] <agsiar2> wait did they just finish SH2?!

[4:32:59] <NireFuster> Oh James wielding the chainsaw is super cool, he's got a unique animation

[4:42:40] <NireFuster> Yeah but Laura wasn't part of Silent Hill, Laura was real
[4:42:41] <BlackermanZX> remember Mary wanted to adopt Laura @WoolieVersus
[4:42:42] <SrHassan> mary wanted to adopt laura
[4:42:43] <+SolGainer> Laura was real and came to silent hill
[4:42:43] <$RunningNGunning> Laura is a real girl
[4:42:44] <MattyNezz> Laura is literally just a little girl
[4:42:44] <Darmanimon> Yes laura is real
[4:42:45] <Darren716> I mean Laura existed prior to Silent Hill
[4:42:45] <%Kriss1827> Laura isnt part of silent hill
[4:42:46] <+BadassCyborg3000> Mary considered Laura her daughter, Laura's real, so he's confronted it and has also adopted Laura.
[4:42:46] <peachy996> Him leaving this earth
[4:42:48] <Torgue_1> She is
[4:42:49] <+SolidusRex> Laura is a real person
[4:42:49] <NireFuster> Laura is 100% real
[4:42:49] <VincentGraves> Laura interacts with Eddie
[4:42:49] <+GrayMatterMiner> Laura's implied to not be a part of silent hill
[4:42:50] <%Javaa01> Leave means he's following Mary's last request
[4:42:50] <OkamiDude15> laura was real
[4:42:50] <PizzicatoFive5> so Mary is a VIRGIN MOTHER??
[4:42:50] <linSP> Laura was real, she never saw monsters because she was innocent
[4:42:51] <Macguffn> I mean, is Silent Hill even real?
[4:42:51] <+Jiggisnipe> Laura actually knew Mary
[4:42:51] <%MyNameIsRasus> Laura is actually real, not a part of delusions
[4:42:52] <NireFuster> She's just a kid
[4:42:52] <Bubsla> Laura is probably real
[4:42:52] <ghilbor> laura was real real tho
[4:42:54] <mortificent> Laura is real
[4:42:54] <+SolidusRex> She's just a kid
[4:42:55] <+NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus James' ultimate fate is never elaborated on. It's fully up to player interpretation.
[4:42:55] <Darren716> She's super real, Mary met her
[4:42:55] <StarlitStunner> Laura is straight up real
[4:42:55] <+Borkbiff > Laura is real though, not a SH creation. She existed before, she knew Mary prior to SH
[4:42:56] <Tracazoid> Laura's real and because she's a kid she isn't effected by Silent Hill
[4:42:56] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Laura, Angela, and Eddie are all real people
[4:42:56] <+DenpaDev> They're all true in a way
[4:42:57] <MattyNezz> Laura was just a regular person
[4:42:57] <dukenux> Yea Laura is a bit of a puzzle
[4:42:59] <BlackermanZX> Laura is actually real
[4:42:59] <SrHassan> Laura is real
[4:42:59] <Zeif00> Laura was a regular child
[4:43:00] <Decimated_body> In future games it's implied that James is never seen again
[4:43:00] <Tracazoid> No trauma and all that
[4:43:00] <+Breaknoon> laura didnt see the demons
[4:43:00] <Scrapl> laura should've had a campaign
[4:43:01] <%shadowsofpain> Laura is actually real, she came to Silent hill
[4:43:02] <%superc37> lauras a real kid
[4:43:03] <+DatAsuna> In water is basically truth
[4:43:03] <dinnydanny777> Why is Laura in Silent Hill
[4:43:06] <linSP> laura had no guilt
[4:43:06] <alikeran> Laura was the only one without guilt
[4:43:07] <SuperGoblinPunch> I always thought Laura was real
[4:43:08] <+HalloKeyori111> Its not super clear, but I think she is real
[4:43:08] <ElBuraindo> she's just a girl who run away from the orphanage
[4:43:09] <+Nero_Cross> Laura sees silent hill as the normal town it is because Laura has no trauma
[4:43:09] <majindusto> The song Mira the Dog was listening  to in the Dog Ending  is a song called "In My Eyes" by Akira Yamaoka for DDR
[4:43:10] <skyshinecrusader> laura is real and came looking for mary same as james @WoolieVersus
[4:43:10] <+maria_luke> laura is mary's friend
[4:43:12] <%Grimlockfly> She’s real girl James and Mary we’re gonna adopt
[4:43:12] <peachy996> Laura is real and can't see the spooky of Silent Hill
[4:43:12] <%ChoculaUltra> so was Laura called to Silent Hill cuz she killed someone too monkaS
[4:43:13] <+SolidusRex> Laura was a little girl Mary knew in the hospital
[4:43:13] <VincentGraves> Laura doesn't see monsters cuz she is a CHILD
[4:43:14] <MattyNezz> She lives in Silent Hill
[4:43:14] <+justianxix> kids are pure
[4:43:15] <%MyNameIsRasus> Laura is a super real kid that was in the hospital with Mary
[4:43:16] <+0neReeler> leave is good/neutral
[4:43:16] <dukenux> but it's implied that since she's a kid, she doesn't see SH like James, Angela or Eddie
[4:43:17] <Darmanimon> Laura went to the same hosoital as mary
[4:43:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Because Silent Hill is a real place
[4:43:18] <mortificent> She's Mary's friend
[4:43:18] <Scrapl> she went to see mary
[4:43:19] <Darren716> I read it as Mary didn't die 3 years ago, James killed her last week
[4:43:21] <+Borkbiff > For Laura, SH is just a normal place, no monsters
[4:43:22] <+AngelYoumou> Laura is real, she's only there because she wants to find Mary, but she has nothing for Silent Hill to feed on, so she sees nothing but an empty town @WoolieVersus
[4:43:25] <wotan316> laure silent hill is different for different ppl
[4:43:25] <Awesome_Leaf> Born From Wish Pog
[4:43:26] <+GrayMatterMiner> looks like a podcast segment!
[4:43:26] <%superc37> what does she know?
[4:43:27] <slackerunchained> Laura is there simply because She met Mary at the hospital and became friends with her. :)
[4:43:27] <Darren716> It's just been 3 years since her diagnosis
[4:43:28] <+NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus Laura is James' final living link to Mary
[4:43:28] <NireFuster> Silent Hill is a real place, you're not seeing the real SIlent Hill just a distorted one
[4:43:29] <%PunishedBuck> Met in the hospital
[4:43:33] <MattyNezz> Silent Hill is ALSO a rea town
[4:43:34] <+Exicuren> Laura net Mary in the hospital and she wanted to adopt her
[4:43:34] <+ElDragon_1> Laura knew Mary from the hospital
[4:43:36] <+HalloKeyori111> She stayed at the same hospital as maria
[4:43:37] <jetpack_rorschasch> She died in the same hospital as Mary.
[4:43:40] <Cubblesv2> Silent Hill is a real place but when people with trauma go there they see the nightmare version
[4:43:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> SH isn't a purgatory other dimension, it's a real place that people go to in that universe
[4:43:40] <dybia> She was just in the same hospital as Mary before James took her home and killed her.
[4:43:41] <+0neReeler> water/maria is bad/neutral
[4:43:42] <Darmanimon> @NopeBadguy what about the pillow?
[4:43:47] <Decimated_body> In future games it's implied that james is never seen again
[4:43:48] <AngryAsian5> Man, I can't wait for the podcast next week LUL
[4:43:49] <goldmod> laura just wanted to give the latter to james
[4:43:49] <lostallmyaccs> Laura went to Silent Hill? All alone?
[4:43:49] <umbraawitch> silent hill is that way because alessa fucked it all up
[4:43:49] <+DatAsuna> Yeah if you're not fucked up Silent Hill is actually a normal town
[4:43:51] <ElBuraindo> Silent Hill doesn't deal with little girls
[4:43:57] <+Nero_Cross> @AngelYoumou Not an empty town, Silent Hill is a normal functioning town for 99% of people that go there
[4:43:59] <%KellBeII> James killing Mary only happened last week, we know this cause Laura mentioned she turned 8 only a week ago.
[4:44:02] <shieldecho> She was in the hospital with Mary, Mary wanted to adopt her, she went to Silent Hill because Mary wasn't at the hospital FOR SOME REASON, and the Leave ending implies James adopts her like Mary wanted.
[4:44:08] <NireFuster> @Decimated_body Only on SH4
[4:44:11] <%superc37> @jetpack_rorschasch woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[4:44:11] <agsiar2> another run?
[4:44:12] <+HalloKeyori111> Laura doesnt seem to see any monsters
[4:44:19] <PizzicatoFive5> just go easy
[4:44:20] <+GrayMatterMiner> people forget that silent hill exists BEHIND the nightmare silent hill
[4:44:21] <+maria_luke> sound?
[4:44:21] <+0neReeler> SH can create people
[4:44:22] <Macguffn> I'd love to spend more time in the normal silent hill in a game, to bad we'll never get it
[4:44:26] <dukenux> monkaS
[4:44:28] <BlackermanZX> SH is a "normal" town for most people
[4:44:29] <peachy996> Right in
[4:44:29] <Darmanimon> gun time
[4:44:31] <NireFuster> Oh shit we going straight to here?!
[4:44:31] <%townzzzzz> PACKING HEAT
[4:44:32] <NireFuster> All right!
[4:44:36] <kaidogs> :)
[4:44:40] <+maria_luke> oh, nvm. can hear it now lolrip
[4:44:42] <+TheMilkiestShake> If Silent Hill is just a normal town to others does that mean that the monsters are just people coming up to James
[4:44:44] <%livlinn> joofbPop
[4:44:45] <+DatAsuna> @AngelYoumou I think shattered memories is the only version of the game where a player could play it and naturally conclude that without being told though
[4:44:45] <+AngelYoumou> @Nero_Cross I know that, but Laura is seeing the empty version, not the real one.

[4:45:03] <NireFuster> @TheMilkiestShake No, we don't fully know how it works but it's likely the town is deserted IRL

[4:45:06] <ElBuraindo> Time ot get REAL
[4:45:08] <dinnydanny777> this music is oppressive debugBounce
[4:45:10] <+Borkbiff > @TheMilkiestShake SH3 has a maybe implication this is the case
[4:45:13] <peachy996> This is a very strange scenario
[4:45:13] <MattyNezz> Silent Hill is only fucked if you reject reality, disassociate from reality, or a little girl with psychic powers creates a fake God to fuck shit up
[4:45:16] <%Double_Tap_That> Yo that revolver's got like 20 chambers
[4:45:16] <Darmanimon> this part of the game is the reason I own the Greatest Hits PS2 version specifically
[4:45:24] <lostallmyaccs> @SrHassan I see
[4:45:25] <Fuji808> Uhh, yo damn, that revolver has enough chambers?
[4:45:28] <peachy996> Personally I don't like it but I do like the music that came from it
[4:45:28] <%livlinn> Whoa trigger discipline please? woolieOMG
[4:45:30] <NireFuster> @TheMilkiestShake There's a line in SH3 that hints to that, but I don't think it's meant to be taken 100% literally, real people are seen as real in SIlent Hill, but you're not IN the real Silent Hill
[4:45:32] <DSD24> The 6 chambers
[4:45:37] <+Jiggisnipe> @MattyNezz thank you, that last part is very important
[4:45:40] <+GrayMatterMiner> put more cylinders in that gun, do it
[4:45:41] <PizzicatoFive5> this ambient music thing tho
[4:45:42] <jorniev> SO SHE IS REAL?
[4:45:43] <GHouseduivel> @livlinn NO :)
[4:45:43] <Darmanimon> @livlinn she has her finger behind the trigger
[4:45:44] <+Borkbiff > The SH3 source is not exactly reliable.
[4:45:46] <+0neReeler> why do i have this gun
[4:45:48] <Fuji808> Hey, hey Steve? Yeah, Steve! Yeah, can we make sure this revolver has, like fourteen chambers when you texture it? Yeah, thanks!
[4:45:48] <dukenux> Kreygasm
[4:45:49] <+セビー> pat has gone on at length about how sh is both a normal, functional resort town but also a freaky purgatory
[4:45:50] <DSD24> I hear cool music
[4:45:51] <Darmanimon> very good attention to detail
[4:45:52] <%dds333a> the exact nature of SH changes in practically every game LUL

[4:46:06] <%superc37> anything.
[4:46:06] <+DatAsuna> Those will not be answered
[4:46:07] <Khorneflakes_> Silent Hill is dream logic
[4:46:07] <+Borkbiff > It can do a lot...
[4:46:08] <Questiy> "Magic"
[4:46:09] <DSD24> @slackerunchained I love the art of reloading
[4:46:11] <BlackermanZX> SH can do a LOT of shit
[4:46:12] <marshalmorphino22> It’s complicated
[4:46:12] <restingbones> Silent hill runs of "rule of cool"
[4:46:13] <Macguffn> I think Silent Hill has questions of what it is and isn't allowed to do
[4:46:17] <%Tearonex> It's all magic bullshit
[4:46:17] <Chatterbox1991> IS SHE THO?
[4:46:17] <R_Blaze> it is all Eldritch
[4:46:18] <MattyNezz> Silent Hill is basically the SMTverse, Maria is basically a Demon
[4:46:18] <%DoktorZee> dont think too much bout it lol
[4:46:18] <jenji919> Questions for the podcast
[4:46:19] <NireFuster> Don't think about it too much, this is not meant to be logical
[4:46:19] <jorniev> WEIRD TIMEPLY WOOMBLY
[4:46:20] <dukenux> vargDuane
[4:46:22] <umbraawitch> dont worry about it
[4:46:24] <Darmanimon> play to find out :)
[4:46:24] <Bubsla> The sequels expand upon it I think
[4:46:24] <Dakuu75> I think this is just a take on, "What if she was her own, real person" no?
[4:46:27] <PizzicatoFive5> she's still her own discrete entity
[4:46:29] <DianaTheAscian> BUT IS SHE?
[4:46:32] <+GrayMatterMiner> the body is real, whether its been altered is another question
[4:46:32] <NireFuster> It's not meant to work logically or be fully understood
[4:46:33] <lostallmyaccs> A llittle from column A and a little from column B?
[4:46:34] <+maria_luke> spirit stuff.
[4:46:36] <KahnWick> 23 years later... WE STILL DONT KNOW
[4:46:37] <%dds333a> No, DON'T ask pat LUL
[4:46:38] <Make_me_mad> It exists because of James, but it's not an illusion.
[4:46:38] <dukenux> oh yea? Silent Hill's fucked up?
[4:46:39] <Voroniel> don't worry, even after 2 decades, we don't either LUL
[4:46:39] <%Prevot> time is convoluted in silent hill
[4:46:40] <linSP> Was she real the first time? Couldn’t be
[4:46:40] <+HalloKeyori111> Its magic
[4:46:43] <skyshinecrusader> do you really know the rules?
[4:46:43] <+healnavi> yeah, there's no illusion.
[4:46:44] <jorniev> YUP
[4:46:45] <Pappajimbo> Silent"Its magic I aint gotta explain shit"Hill
[4:46:45] <+tussletoes> a manpifestation but she SEEMS SENTIENT AND SELF AWARE
[4:46:46] <umbraawitch> not everything is meant to have an answer
[4:46:49] <nailwind> shes a sentient byproduct of a disturbed mind, its fucked up
[4:46:50] <iswearimjustdandy> Its “I’m Thinking of Ending Things”
[4:46:51] <+セビー> consult gregstaresat
[4:46:53] <peachy996> You could say the residual energy from Alessa lets the town do this
[4:46:54] <+DatAsuna> the old gods can make a lot of shit
[4:46:55] <slackerunchained> @DSD24 Now I have this awful mental image of Maria with Ocelots mustache and receding hairline! XD
[4:47:00] <cossuoldm> There's no Illusion, Woolie, Silent Hill is real and so are its horrors
[4:47:00] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yep
[4:47:01] <+0neReeler> don't worry about it
[4:47:03] <+Borkbiff > Not an illusion. There's a "different" Silent Hill for every person, basically.
[4:47:03] <Make_me_mad> It's not an illusion, it's reality warping. Remember, Alessa's nightmares were made real.
[4:47:03] <OblivionSword1> Silent Hill IS fucked up
[4:47:05] <+GrayMatterMiner> woolie is starting to piece it together
[4:47:05] <mortificent> Silent Hill is a real town, only fucked up people see the magic shit
[4:47:06] <zedravan> the power of gyromancy
[4:47:06] <DXLelouch24> yea but Silent Hill dont got shit on Wandas level of power
[4:47:07] <peachy996> And of course SH3 has more energy
[4:47:10] <BlackermanZX> i don't think the town will ever let you leave
[4:47:11] <lostallmyaccs> Some West World shit
[4:47:11] <dukenux> It's like in Solaris, she's a "gift"
[4:47:12] <NireFuster> @peachy996 No, that's 100% it, the residual dark energy of the cult is what causes SH2
[4:47:12] <luftraumm1> go play sh3, your questions have implications
[4:47:14] <DSD24> @slackerunchained She's doing the Ocelot pose too!
[4:47:20] <%brisk_dacat> Pat will have all the answers
[4:47:20] <+0neReeler> Silent Hill aka Twilight Zone
[4:47:24] <NireFuster> @peachy996 Sh2 is what happens when the cult fucks off and SH is left to its own devices
[4:47:25] <+GrayMatterMiner> HOW
[4:47:26] <Zap_Rowsdower32> One bullet left
[4:47:26] <dukenux> 1 bullet
[4:47:27] <+Borkbiff > And for most people, SH is normal enough a place.
[4:47:28] <%dds333a> Yeah but she ain't real
[4:47:28] <Darren716> 1 bullet
[4:47:29] <%mr_sups> XKCD Dream comic

[4:47:34] <slackerunchained> @DSD24 "You're... Pretty good, James..."
[4:47:36] <Darren716> Or is it all you need?
[4:47:37] <+AngelYoumou> Only one bullet....Symbolism
[4:47:38] <+GrayMatterMiner> how does it hold ten?!
[4:47:38] <funnyfunnykid> those are some tiny ass bullets
[4:47:39] <Darmanimon> one bullet is all you need
[4:47:41] <Chatterbox1991> pat theorized in the old lp that she might have been a person who was brought in and "altered"
[4:47:43] <%brisk_dacat> So girls are complicated
[4:47:43] <dukenux> no memo

[4:48:32] <DSD24> Was she changed before she was gonna kill herself?
[4:48:32] <+Breaknoon> nice angles
[4:48:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> 10 bullets in a revolver would probably be like a .22

[4:48:47] <+セビー> i was hoping for woolie to lose the one bullet to bad trigger discipline and never getting more
[4:48:48] <+Breaknoon> film noir
[4:48:48] <+GrayMatterMiner> oh reggie, this aint an apartment lol
[4:48:51] <+0neReeler> the new Strive Character?
[4:48:55] <Darmanimon> it's a poster for the strip club
[4:49:01] <Bubsla> oh, it is
[4:49:01] <DrkJP520> That seems weird though, because we never see her interacting with anyone but James. As if she really was nothing but a figment, but then they made this scenario cuz fuck it.
[4:49:07] <PizzicatoFive5> this isn't a regular person that was just warped into Maria, that theory sucks
[4:49:13] <Darmanimon> Silent Hill needing a strip club makes sense tbh
[4:49:17] <BearSawed> do not lab, do not look up move list do not combo. do not pass go or collect the good end
[4:49:19] <+Breaknoon> i had that Maria wall scroll back in the day

[4:49:45] <Bubsla> can we go bowl?
[4:49:46] <+Borkbiff > She's a figment in that she was only birthed when James entered SH, and she relies on him for existing
[4:49:46] <Darmanimon> @marshalmorphino22 tell that to the pole in the middle of the room LUL
[4:49:51] <Bubsla> can we eat pizza?
[4:49:53] <ghilbor> figments deserve backstories too
[4:49:53] <+JustToWatch> Maria got rekkas though?
[4:49:56] <PizzicatoFive5> @DrkJP520 that, and why would she be able to see and be killed by Pyramid Head when no one else but its current victim is implied to do so?
[4:49:57] <jenji919> The silent hill club is extra moldy and rusty
[4:50:06] <%dds333a> @bubsla HOW CAN YOU
[4:50:06] <+Borkbiff > But the town gives her a psudo-life of a sort.

[4:52:02] <nailwind> wide swings
[4:52:03] <restingbones> It is unusual for a neon light girl to have chub on it, so I can understand the confusion.
[4:52:10] <Darmanimon> she's got an overhead PogChamp
[4:52:11] <shieldecho> So she's not pregananant, she's just meant to look like a more real human woman, and not every human woman is Hollywood anorexic.
[4:52:15] <+0neReeler> same
[4:52:18] <+GrayMatterMiner> why would you need to aim higher than the dick
[4:52:24] <%Javaa01> Ammo should not be a problem in this scenario, so just do whatever
[4:52:29] <Scrapl> good to have a healthy girl
[4:52:34] <DSD24> True it is a more relaxed pose
[4:52:37] <Fuji808> Someone slipped a card in between the slit of the coin slot and the card reader of the Tekken machine and managed to yank quarters out of the Tekken machine, stealing money from the arcade? REMOVE THE TEKKEN MACHINE, NO MORE TEKKEN FOR ANYBODY
[4:52:38] <slackerunchained> Do a little dance for us, Maria...

[5:04:34] <NireFuster> @Javaa01 True, but I generally remember expansion packs being more high effort than DLCs overall

[5:18:09] <+SlappyMeats> "When the boards cover all" has the subtlety of a Resident Evil puzzle
[5:18:10] <JayCue_yt> are these not the items from the rebirth ending?
[5:18:13] <+HalloKeyori111> Arent those the Items you need to collect for the rebirth ending?
[5:18:13] <Darmanimon> a miserable pile of secrets
[5:18:44] <Darmanimon> this puzzle is just Wordle
[5:18:49] <cossuoldm> yeah, those are the item for rebirth
[5:18:59] <+セビー> uh oh
[5:19:02] <%MyNameIsRasus> oh yeah, have to do today's wordle
[5:19:03] <w_khan> oh cool puzzle

[5:19:05] <slackerunchained> "Spencer's OTHER Mansion..."
[5:19:09] <lostallmyaccs> ok
[5:19:17] <+セビー> expose your one true hole
[5:19:52] <slackerunchained> @HalloKeyori111 Yes. They are.
[5:20:01] <MattyNezz> Brute force time
[5:20:18] <+セビー> 720 grapple is the only way
[5:20:28] <slackerunchained> SHADOW PUZZLLEEEEEEES!
[5:20:52] <+SlappyMeats> yeah, it would be nice to not have to rotate it before you can see it
[5:20:55] <lostallmyaccs> guess the mix
[5:20:58] <Fuji808> I'm more thinking about how some poor illustrator had to draw every single permutation for this puzzle.
[5:21:00] <NireFuster> shadowww puzzleessssssss
[5:21:05] <Darmanimon> I figured this out by drawing all the boards on post it notes and cutting out the holes
[5:21:07] <slackerunchained> @SlappyMeats hardware limitations...
[5:21:16] <+SlappyMeats> Reggie with the big brain moves
[5:21:22] <PizzicatoFive5> there are multiple solutions by the way
[5:21:24] <+セビー> @darmanimon thats how i’d probably solve it too
[5:21:26] <MattyNezz> 4x4
[5:21:26] <%dds333a> @slappymeats always
[5:21:31] <w_khan> it looks 4x4
[5:21:33] <+CursedNobleman> did they already finish sh2?
[5:21:44] <thomasvalentine31> @CursedNobleman ya
[5:21:45] <NireFuster> Puzzles that require you to get a pen and paper and write stuff down are amazing
[5:21:46] <lostallmyaccs> You just need to pay attention to the corner holes
[5:21:46] <+0neReeler> half the puzzle is interface LUL
[5:21:48] <PizzicatoFive5> yeah, they got In Water
[5:21:49] <Torgue_1> @CursedNobleman Yes
[5:21:49] <Darmanimon> @CursedNobleman yup, this is the prequel scenario
[5:21:51] <%dds333a> The R.E.G System is flawless (nearly)
[5:22:14] <+CursedNobleman> ooh, that ending @PizzicatoFive5 on accident?
[5:22:15] <Fuji808> @CursedNobleman Finished SH2, watched all the endings on Youtube, now playing the prequel scenario that's exclusive to the director's cut.
[5:22:15] <Tales911> Thinking and puzzles
[5:22:25] <Darmanimon> you can put the boards into the hole in any order
[5:22:31] <PizzicatoFive5> @CursedNobleman I wasn't here unfortunately, but I believe it was a completely blind playthrough

[5:23:12] <Darmanimon> 2-2 and 4-1
[5:23:16] <%dds333a> @pizzicatofive5 essentially woolie knew only a few things, and ref knew nothing. woolie didn't scen know the twist

[5:23:37] <Nelsukako> god i hate this puzzle

[5:23:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1483311049713635328?s=20
[5:24:08] <agsiar2> i do not understand this pzuzle...
[5:24:11] <agsiar2> *puzzle
[5:24:17] <dashwallkick> there's a hint somewhere else I think?
[5:24:17] <+HalloKeyori111> I never liked this scenario
[5:24:25] <Nelsukako> @slackerunchained shaaadow puuuuzzleeeeee
[5:24:29] <w_khan> the drawins
[5:24:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @slackerunchained
[5:24:39] <+VladVandal> this is the true horror experience
[5:24:44] <Awesome_Leaf> just take em all out and solve it in the inventory screen NotLikeThis
[5:24:58] <lostallmyaccs> Me neither HalloKeyori111
[5:24:59] <agsiar2> what is this puzzle about?
[5:25:01] <slackerunchained> GOD DAMN YOU, OSWELL SPENCER!
[5:25:04] <Tales911> if any of Y'all need a snack or a bathroom break nows the time
[5:25:04] <PizzicatoFive5> @dds333a gotcha, so they only got In Water by being very thrifty with healing items?
[5:25:08] <+UncleMcgoo> this might be the rest of the stream
[5:25:13] <+HalloKeyori111> There are multiple solutions aswell
[5:25:21] <Nelsukako> @agsiar2 is about covering all the green parts of the screen
[5:25:21] <%dds333a> @pizzicatofive5 yep LUL
[5:25:29] <agsiar2> @agsiar2 ooooh
[5:25:37] <agsiar2> thank you
[5:25:41] <MattyNezz> The solution is There's only 1 solution, but you can "turn" the solution
[5:25:45] <cossuoldm> When I die, I too will make my tomb into a random puzzle, looks fun
[5:26:06] <lostallmyaccs> You do it like this and then like that and bam, done :)
[5:26:08] <Camo_boy67> Hello everyone.
[5:26:13] <+VladVandal> aight. who's  got the graph paper?
[5:26:17] <ry4n_c00per> atpDance atp777
[5:26:24] <+セビー> grab opposing corners and turn it topwise
[5:26:28] <%dds333a> @cossuoldm the Pharoahs had the right idea Kappa
[5:27:00] <BlackermanZX> im too dumb to understand this StinkyGlitch
[5:27:09] <MattyNezz> Woolie has tried this same solution like 5 times LUL
[5:27:14] <lostallmyaccs> yes to the left
[5:27:16] <+UncleMcgoo> this is the only puzzle in the series i ever cheated on
[5:27:24] <lostallmyaccs> oh shit LU
[5:27:30] <%dds333a> Kappa
[5:27:31] <+セビー> last one looks like 180 mighta done it?
[5:27:37] <DrkJP520> Is the point to completely hide the green background?
[5:27:38] <%dds333a> woolieGASM
[5:27:41] <cossuoldm> @dds333a the true mvps of the ancient world, making puzzles and traps for our entertainment
[5:27:42] <+SlappyMeats> the black and the green look terribly similar
[5:28:12] <KaiserMario> But Baba...
[5:28:20] <+セビー> baba ceases to be
[5:28:28] <lostallmyaccs> The order matters because the first one cannot be turned
[5:28:36] <octotasty> paper time
[5:28:38] <+VladVandal> I would pulled paper put 20 secs  in LOP
[5:28:40] <+VladVandal> lol
[5:28:47] <NireFuster> I would've pulled out the paper 20 minutes ago
[5:28:55] <slackerunchained> The 'F**k this Sh*t' ending: Achieved by spending more than an hour of time trying to solve the game's puzzles...
[5:28:56] <%The_Timo> the first one doesnt matter I dont think, the entire puzzle depends on its relation to the other 2
[5:28:59] <+セビー> yeah man, paper gang rise up
[5:29:04] <+セビー> paper paper
[5:29:07] <lostallmyaccs> paper up
[5:29:09] <Darmanimon> it's ok to pull out some paper and do it in person, some people learn by rotating the solution in their hands instead of picturing it and that's okay
[5:29:29] <dukenux> this would be so much easier to do irl
[5:29:33] <octotasty> the game probably expects you to pull up some paper
[5:29:39] <+Krasmeyts> I feel like Red and Black *must* be 180 to each other as a start
[5:29:41] <%Theycallmenerf> Damn archaic puzzles
[5:29:50] <MattyNezz> Woolie just REALLY wants to 180 black
[5:29:52] <%dds333a> hence why I miss manuals that had a notes section
[5:29:57] <w_khan> @octotasty nah i think the drawings are your guide
[5:30:01] <agsiar2> i think it's "as is", "as is", and "90 to the left"
[5:30:02] <%dds333a> hell, I miss manuals in general
[5:30:09] <+セビー> csbeastGou csbeastGi
[5:30:50] <projectcapsule> black rotate right red r9tate left
[5:30:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:30:51] <Darmanimon> @dds333a funny enough, the thing that made me dislike Mass Effect 3 more than the ending was that the game didn't come with a manual
[5:31:06] <Darren716> Legit Pat just gave up and looked up the solution for this one
[5:31:06] <MattyNezz> He got it
[5:31:25] <+セビー> pat is a coward, a paperless coward
[5:31:25] <%dds333a> @darmanimon LUL
[5:31:27] <Nelsukako> @Darren716 pat smart boy. Be like pat
[5:31:44] <MattyNezz> No, wait, I got it backwards, he doesn't got this
[5:31:47] <+SlappyMeats> yeah it does look like red and black interact best opposite each other
[5:31:49] <+セビー> greg on the other hand..
[5:31:52] <lostallmyaccs> Pat gives up in 90% of the puzzles
[5:32:14] <+UncleMcgoo> pat's ape brain brute forces every puzzle
[5:32:18] <Darmanimon> Pat the type of mf to look up Baba Is You solutions on YouTube
[5:32:20] <slackerunchained> You know. Looking at this from a Meta-perspective, this puzzle *IS* pretty emblematic of someone who despises themselves and wants to die, inside... :P
[5:32:26] <a_mad_dragon_> there's effectively only 16 configurations since the first plate doesn't matter
[5:32:35] <Fuji808> PatGivesUp is my least favorite TikTok account
[5:32:40] <projectcapsule> white as is black rotate right red r9tate left
[5:32:44] <+セビー> hey HEY.. baba gets stupid hard.. too smart for me anyway
[5:32:51] <+VladVandal> props to the sadist who designed this system
[5:33:08] <Darmanimon> Baba is You is for people far smarter than me, so I get it
[5:33:17] <DrkJP520> Get some paper and scissors, problem solved in 5 seconds
[5:33:22] <+VladVandal> fr
[5:33:47] <Nelsukako> please woolie go check for a answer. This puzzle.....it is really indeed not great, and i speak as someone who likes the weird ass puzzles of silent hill normally
[5:33:48] <+VladVandal> and doing it irl  is probably very immersing
[5:34:08] <+UncleMcgoo> this shit right here is why i never replay Born From a Wish
[5:34:12] <lostallmyaccs> It's so funny to me that this puzzle is hard in this day and age simply because people refuse to use paper LUL
[5:34:21] <w_khan> If he wants to do it let him chat
[5:34:32] <slackerunchained> @lostallmyaccs What are we? Cavemen?
[5:34:50] <JayCue_yt> where's a magnet on a string when you need it
[5:34:51] <+セビー> oh no hate on him doing it this way..but paper wouldve solved this already
[5:35:00] <MattyNezz> NOPE
[5:35:04] <Nelsukako> @UncleMcgoo which is a shame because the other stuff in this side story are so great.....i love the little story that it has in there
[5:35:11] <Fuji808> We need a ring to keep the fridge locked
[5:35:19] <Uncle_Christian> down on the up side
[5:35:27] <%Theycallmenerf> We need a crank
[5:35:38] <lostallmyaccs> With the crank sfx
[5:35:47] <Uncle_Christian> *crank squeak*
[5:35:49] <ElBuraindo> how...
[5:35:50] <+Proxzo> is that an upside down kewpie bottle?
[5:35:52] <Fuji808> no idiot we need a valve and then we use it exactly one time and dont bring it with us obvi
[5:35:53] <DrkJP520> Figuring this puzzle out in game ain't intuitive.
[5:35:55] <KahnWick> This puzzle sucks, its needlessly complicated
[5:35:59] <octotasty> why do you give them numbers instead of coordinates?
[5:36:13] <Uncle_Christian> Isolate that "I'm an idiot"
[5:36:20] <Darmanimon> @octotasty fighting game num pad notation
[5:36:24] <%Theycallmenerf> Clip that
[5:36:36] <MattyNezz> They're going about this the wrong way, it doesn't matter if there's more coverage or not. The puzzle is ALL spaces covered, there's very little correlation between that and covering the most spaces with 2.
[5:36:37] <%dds333a> @uncle_christian no need, we already know
[5:36:42] <Uncle_Christian> indeed
[5:36:53] <octotasty> @Darmanimon but... the numpad has 9 numbers, not 16
[5:37:01] <Macguffn> time for brute smarts
[5:37:07] <KaiserMario> But if Baba is not you then he ceases to be!
[5:37:13] <%Theycallmenerf> 4*4=16
[5:37:14] <Darmanimon> yeah they're adding more numbers to it, hence why it's not working LUL
[5:37:18] <+セビー> ceases. to. be.
[5:37:41] <+Jiggisnipe> i get it
[5:37:42] <MattyNezz> When you KNOW there's a correct solution, you need to try and find the "problem" areas of the puzzle, and solve those, as they're likely to have only 1 or 2 possible solutions, which narrows down your possibilities
[5:37:50] <+Jiggisnipe> i would just brute force it earlier tho LUL
[5:37:56] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How can this be??!?

[6:05:42] <Macguffn> he said he'd open the stairs
[6:05:49] <peachy996> It doesn't necessarily hurt that rather than James being forced to look at himself, Maria has to look at James
[6:05:51] <holyxgrale> Hey they're talking about you on dev hour!
[6:06:01] <%Theycallmenerf> I got it, Maria sees James and is a mega bitch because she can’t get out of the damn mansion.

[6:27:35] <%Theycallmenerf> Is Silent Hill sentient? Does it have a Stand?

[6:27:37] <ElBuraindo> magic space drugs
[6:27:37] <dinnydanny777> I guess Ernest gyromancied too much
[6:27:38] <jimgimp> Have you read the SCP article about Massachusetts?
[6:27:40] <linSP> Maria can leave but in the ending where she leaves with him, she probably gets the same sickness as Mary
[6:27:41] <dinnydanny777> Also SourPls
[6:27:43] <DianaTheAscian> Pat has a theory but I forgot what it is
[6:27:43] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AngelFlashNishikino
[6:27:46] <+Iamdenril> seems like a place that become sentient through the sheer amount of cursed shit thats happened there
[6:27:50] <Voroniel> it's like she's born from a wish haHAA
[6:27:51] <Pablox010> She is not real, she is only real to James
[6:27:54] <Khorneflakes_> Silent Hill is some dream realm, that may or may not be sentient *shrug*
[6:27:54] <ElBuraindo> oh yeah and PAAAAAIN
[6:27:55] <tetrabrick1lt> BRAVO KOJIMA
[6:27:55] <MattyNezz> Silent Hill can affect OTHER places
[6:27:56] <slackerunchained> I think Stephen King would attribute all this weirdness to what he would call a "thinny".
[6:27:59] <%hereiam407> Pat thought it was a real person who was transformed by the town
[6:28:00] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's up to interpretation honestly
[6:28:00] <dan_g_v> Woolie, Silent Hil made Harry's baby in the first game
[6:28:01] <+HalloKeyori111> It pretty much answers nothing really, but the whole fun of SH2 is the speculation
[6:28:01] <%Javaa01> Silent Hill as you see it in this game is basically the aftermath of all the cult fuckery of 1, and how it forever cursed this town
[6:28:02] <%kyh9> She's a real person, but she can't leave the town
[6:28:05] <linSP> man I sure wish Mary was real. Hol up
[6:28:05] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> a consciousness apart from reality
[6:28:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Silent Hill is the Hunters Dream
[6:28:07] <%KellBeII> she is essentially a monster like all the others youre looking at.  thats why she doesnt go into the bowling alley.
[6:28:08] <+AngelFlashNishikino> I left to get a drink and now the credits are rolling wtf did i miss
[6:28:13] <Pappajimbo> silent hill is the source but is not confined to the town
[6:28:15] <w_khan> Yeah at the end she self realized
[6:28:15] <%DoktorZee> is she real if she cant leave silent hill?
[6:28:17] <NireFuster> Maria is either a person that was morphed by Silent Hill to become Maria, or she's completely made up by the town
[6:28:20] <MrMatternot> The Hunters Dream is close
[6:28:25] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> she's a ghost clone goddamnit
[6:28:28] <peachy996> @DianaTheAscian I thin his theory is the town took someone and transformed them into maria
[6:28:32] <NireFuster> But Maria isn't real, she's like a monster
[6:28:32] <%TungstenViper> basically StarKiller from TFU2
[6:28:38] <MrMatternot> She is The Doll
[6:28:38] <+Shonen_hero> Woolie's kinda right
[6:28:41] <+theoldone001> She's James guilt personified.
[6:28:42] <NireFuster> She only was given sentience and knowledge of what she is
[6:28:43] <slackerunchained> @NireFuster I think she was morphed, as there's a picture of a prostitute that looks a LOT like her...
[6:28:46] <%hereiam407> Good track
[6:28:50] <ry4n_c00per> so, are they playing sh3 too ?
[6:28:50] <+Jiggisnipe> She probably follows similar rules to Lisa. Not that she's dead but a monster of SH
[6:28:51] <dinnydanny777> I'm still confused by Ernest's family/the jar NotLikeThis
[6:28:51] <MattyNezz> Only Pat thought MAria was a real person. Nothing else in the entire series fits that, so it's pretty unlikely
[6:28:54] <ShinyVagikarp> SourPls
[6:28:57] <w_khan> @MrMatternot yeah the Doll is a great example
[6:28:59] <+liquidzr0> shofuMillyrock shofuMillyrock shofuMillyrock shofuMillyrock shofuMillyrock shofuMillyrock
[6:29:00] <majindusto> The only good thing to come of the PSVita game  is a Lyrical  version  of this song "LOVE PSALM"
[6:29:05] <BlackermanZX> man the SH gods are pricks
[6:29:13] <NireFuster> @slackerunchained That's plausible, but it's possibly a person that already died, remember she is found with a revolver with one bullet, the person might've commited suicide, and then Maria was born from that death
[6:29:14] <AngryAsian5> The lack of concrete explanation really makes for good discussion
[6:29:15] <peachy996> Oh yeah Love Psalm rules
[6:29:17] <%jinking79> and this is y ppl got tired of the Cult stuff in these games
[6:29:21] <linSP> Ernest was based
[6:29:25] <Pookiedaexzile> She's as Real as the monsters who she becomes
[6:29:28] <%hereiam407> Nothing but this town's plaything
[6:29:31] <Darren716> Laura wasn't born in SH
[6:29:34] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus But did you like the game? Do you get the love people have for it?
[6:29:36] <MattyNezz> Laura isn't born in Silent Hill
[6:29:36] <Valtorias> did they go through sh2 scares and sounds?
[6:29:37] <Darren716> Laura is 150% real
[6:29:38] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> It's a black mirror fate
[6:29:39] <%hereiam407> Laura seems normal
[6:29:39] <%crybirb> Laura isn't created by Silent Hill
[6:29:40] <+AngelYoumou> Laura exists
[6:29:41] <MattyNezz> Laura is real HARD CONFIRMED
[6:29:41] <+JustToWatch> is silent hill just an enemy stand
[6:29:41] <Pablox010> Laura is real
[6:29:41] <%GameFreakerZero> Laura's real
[6:29:42] <Melchior_the_Wise> Laura was not born in silent hill
[6:29:42] <+healnavi> ????
[6:29:43] <w_khan> Laura is real
[6:29:43] <+SolidusRex> Laura's a real person
[6:29:44] <brunoberserk> i think pat have a theory of she being a normal person that got '' transformed '' in Maria , the town changed her or something , not a big fan of this theory
[6:29:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> Laura is SUPER real
[6:29:44] <+tempestzephyr> laura is real
[6:29:46] <OuendanCyrus> Laura is real
[6:29:46] <%hereiam407> Laura doesn't even see monsters
[6:29:47] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Laura is real
[6:29:48] <%shadowsofpain> Laura wasn't from silent hill
[6:29:49] <kaidogs> laura is very real
[6:29:49] <+pectusumbra> Laura is just a kid that Mary met in the hospital

[6:29:53] <BlackermanZX> Laura is 100% real
[6:29:55] <AngryAsian5> Maria is as real as she needs to be
[6:29:55] <NireFuster> Laura is just a kid living in Silent Hill
[6:29:56] <Cozy90> LAURA SEES NO MONSTERS
[6:29:56] <linSP> laura doesn’t see the fog
[6:29:56] <peachy996> I think they snuck yamaoka into the studio for book of memories soundtrack
[6:29:57] <ospreyworks> Mary knew Laura
[6:29:58] <MattyNezz> Yup
[6:29:59] <MrMatternot> just a kid
[6:29:59] <Darren716> She's just a kid Mary knew
[6:29:59] <OuendanCyrus> She's Mary's friend
[6:30:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> Laura was a friend of Mary
[6:30:00] <%Grimlockfly> The Laura is just a regular girl that lives there
[6:30:00] <+Jiggisnipe> for Mary
[6:30:01] <$RunningNGunning> She was friends with Mary looking for her
[6:30:02] <Vigogs> Laura was friends with Mary, that's it
[6:30:02] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> this is on the film
[6:30:02] <+CptBritches> Laura is absolutely a real kid, she was Mary's friend in the hospital
[6:30:02] <BlackLabud> She was friend with Mary IRL, they emt at the hospital
[6:30:03] <Darmanimon> She was in the same hospital as mary
[6:30:04] <+healnavi> They explained that
[6:30:04] <%hereiam407> A girl that met Mary in the hospital, and was going to be adopted by her
[6:30:05] <drunken_lemur> Laura missed Mary
[6:30:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> Laura LITERALLY told you everything
[6:30:05] <+SolGainer> Laura was in the hospital with Mary
[6:30:05] <BlackermanZX> Laura sees no monsters
[6:30:06] <Chatterbox1991> Mary knew Laura
[6:30:06] <%TungstenViper> Laura was Mary's friend in the hospital
[6:30:07] <%livlinn> Oh?
[6:30:07] <w_khan> Laura was a orphan at the hospital that Mary meet
[6:30:08] <dukenux> To paraphrase Room 1408, "It's an EVIL fucking town"
[6:30:08] <+SolidusRex> They knew each other in the hospital
[6:30:09] <Zap_Rowsdower32> She knew Mary at the hospital and got close
[6:30:10] <MrMatternot> Hospital sickness
[6:30:10] <+SolidusRex> She tells you this
[6:30:11] <jetpack_rorschasch> She died in the hospital Mary used to be in.
[6:30:11] <%superc37> she was in the hospital with mary
[6:30:12] <ElBuraindo> orphan
[6:30:12] <NireFuster> @WoolieVersus Laura was Mary's friend in the hospital, she's just a kid living in Silent Hill
[6:30:14] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Laura is like the Cheryl baby at the end of one
[6:30:16] <+NopeBadguy> She was in the same hospital Mary was in
[6:30:16] <%itstreylar> she was in the hospital yes
[6:30:16] <%shadowsofpain> She was Mary's friend from the hospital
[6:30:16] <majindusto> Laura  knew Mary...Thats why
[6:30:17] <%Javaa01> Laura is there to find Mary, after getting her letter
[6:30:17] <slackerunchained> @NireFuster I think - because the bullet was unfired - that that person MEANT to commit suicide and SH basically said "Well, since you don't intend to use this body for much longer, anyway, then *I'll* make use of it, instead..."
[6:30:17] <cossuoldm> The letter to Laura doesn't disappear, she's real
[6:30:19] <GHouseduivel> Silent Hill is just a town, that causes the guilty to it
[6:30:19] <%superc37> woolie she told you
[6:30:20] <%KellBeII> Laura does not live in silent hill, she was at the same hospital as mary and she came to town to look for her
[6:30:20] <Darren716> yup
[6:30:21] <+healnavi> yes
[6:30:22] <w_khan> yep
[6:30:22] <tofutasties> shes looking for mary, they were friends at the hospital
[6:30:23] <Cozy90> YES
[6:30:24] <bosssbatttle> yes
[6:30:24] <OuendanCyrus> Mary was going to adopt Laura.
[6:30:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No Maria is created by Jame mind I think, not SH
[6:30:25] <JeoDood> silent hill is a normal place
[6:30:26] <AngryAsian5> Laura was there to find Mary like James. They met in the hospital. Laura is a kid, so she doesn't see any of the wonky shit.
[6:30:27] <+AngelYoumou> Laura was in the hospital with MAry. She went looking for Mary, and this pulled her there.
[6:30:29] <Zeif00> YES
[6:30:29] <+CptBritches> Yes, remember Mary thought of Laura as her own daughter and wanted to adopt her
[6:30:30] <BlackLabud> She came looking for Mary
[6:30:30] <slackerunchained> Laura is simply there because she wants to meet her friend.
[6:30:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Children have tramua too
[6:30:31] <R_Blaze> since Mary has no guilt, she doesn't see any bad stuff
[6:30:32] <+solzan2000> she's an innocent
[6:30:34] <Darmanimon> she went to Silent Hill to look for Mary
[6:30:37] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yep, that's why she doesn't see any monsters. She's just a kid with no baggage.
[6:30:38] <+Jiggisnipe> @brunoberserk that theory seems weird, where did he get that from?
[6:30:39] <%Grimlockfly> Why do you think Laura is left alone?
[6:30:39] <R_Blaze> I meant Lauren
[6:30:41] <BlackermanZX> SH is a normal kid that lives in Normal Silent Hill
[6:30:41] <peachy996> she doesnt see the monsters
[6:30:43] <rabbitective> THE TOWN IS NORMAL WOOLIE
[6:30:43] <ospreyworks> Is anything you're seeing of the town real?
[6:30:44] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Remember, the letter Laura gives you in the Hotel never goes away, it is real
[6:30:45] <Pappajimbo> laura has no trama so sees no monsters
[6:30:45] <majindusto> Laura  never sees the Monsters
[6:30:45] <NireFuster> @slackerunchained That's possible, but I don't think Silent Hill has sentience like that, but it could definitely be
[6:30:46] <MattyNezz> Not necessarily alone, Silent Hill the regular town still exists
[6:30:48] <%shadowsofpain> Because she doesn't have trauma silent hill isn't fucked up for her
[6:30:48] <+HalloKeyori111> She was looking for Mary. She was in the same hospital as her. She is an orphan aswell. She has no trauma or guilt, so no monsters or delusions
[6:30:49] <%livlinn> Seems like it
[6:30:50] <ospreyworks> What if the town is normal?
[6:30:53] <$RunningNGunning> The town is very likely normal for her because she is an innocent child
[6:30:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> Laura's looking for Mary, Mary is dead, she mentioned Silent Hill probably once, she went to SH to find Mary.
[6:30:54] <Darren716> I figure she just ran away when Mary died since that was the closest thing to a mother she had
[6:30:55] <graemebl> Woolie she told you
[6:30:55] <penitentpendant> I thought it was implied she died in the same hospital as Mary?
[6:30:55] <Vigogs> she went to Silent Hill, but she wasn't DRAWN to it like the 3 people
[6:30:55] <ospreyworks> But James can't see it?
[6:31:00] <+Zeroblazex> Silent  Hill has no beef with her
[6:31:03] <w_khan> She wanted to meet Mary in the REAL Silent Hill, not in this parallel world
[6:31:04] <Darren716> And it's presumed she's an orphan
[6:31:06] <NireFuster> Laura lives on the normal Silent Hill, Laura doesn't see all the fucked up shit that James and others see
[6:31:07] <+Shonen_hero> Laura... is sort of immune from Silent Hill. She doesn't have preconceptions or guilt or a past that Silent Hill can really draw from to haunt or torment her
[6:31:09] <ElBuraindo> she phases into Jame's view of Silent hill,
[6:31:14] <slackerunchained> Laura is not tormented because she has no heavy psycological baggage.
[6:31:24] <%crybirb> Time is convoluted in Silent Hill
[6:31:24] <BlackLabud> She also doesn't see all the crazy shit because she's an innocent kid
[6:31:24] <DrkJP520> There could be some time shenanigans happening
[6:31:24] <dinnydanny777> I'm kind of uncomfortable thinking of Laura being left with James in one of the endings NotLikeThis
[6:31:27] <brunoberserk> @Jiggisnipe i remember him talking about this in the silent hill 2 lp in the old channel
[6:31:28] <%emMmDeeKay> @w_khan there is no parallel world
[6:31:30] <jetpack_rorschasch> Laura died in Silent Hill Woolie, so she was wondering around looking for Mary.
[6:31:30] <+CptBritches> Yeah, it confirms that James just recently killed Mary. Also, her body is in the trunk of the car at the beginning, multiple devs have confirmed that
[6:31:33] <%crybirb> LAura is like the kid of Sixth Sense
[6:31:35] <%TungstenViper> James sees her because of her connection to Mary
[6:31:35] <$RunningNGunning> The town is very likely normal for her because she is an innocent child
[6:31:38] <w_khan> Laura was only called since she wanted to meet Mary
[6:31:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolie needs to understand SH is a REAL NORMAL place
[6:31:40] <VincentGraves> she doesn't SEE MONSTERS
[6:31:40] <ospreyworks> But is it?
[6:31:41] <Darmanimon> yeah Laura sees no monsters so she's not really traumatized by Silent Hill like James is
[6:31:41] <+HalloKeyori111> I dont think she sees the same town that james sees
[6:31:42] <OuendanCyrus> Laura can't see monsters.
[6:31:43] <Zeif00> She doesn't see the monsters
[6:31:43] <+trekkie11041> luara sees no monsters
[6:31:46] <%superc37> @woolieversus mary even mentioned wanting to adopt laura in her letter
[6:31:47] <%Grimlockfly> Is it a dangerous monster world?
[6:31:47] <+Jiggisnipe> Laura is looking for Mary. They were friends. She didn't know she was dead
[6:31:47] <kaidogs> no monsters for her to see
[6:31:48] <shieldecho> She was in the hospital with Mary, Mary wanted to adopt her, and Laura then went to Silent Hill to look for Mary after she MYSTERIOUSLY VANISHED
[6:31:49] <magreaux> laura's innocent, town presents no danger for her
[6:31:50] <MattyNezz> Creators confirmed Laura is real
[6:31:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Why would Laura see monsters
[6:31:53] <NireFuster> Mary didn't die three years ago, she died before the game starts, James kills her right before
[6:31:54] <Pookiedaexzile> What did she do
[6:31:54] <%superc37> no its not woolie
[6:31:55] <MrMatternot> Angela never meets Laura
[6:31:56] <+healnavi> ????
[6:31:57] <Macguffn> Laura probably just in the real town and can see James
[6:31:58] <w_khan> @emMmDeeKay there is a real town, and there is this ghost town world
[6:31:58] <BlackermanZX> its implied she doesnt see the monsters @WoolieVersus
[6:31:59] <OuendanCyrus> Laura does not see any monsters.
[6:32:01] <%shadowsofpain> The town can't harm her, it's just a normal abandoned town for her
[6:32:02] <Darmanimon> Laura does not see the monsters
[6:32:02] <MsYakumo> Laura is probably safe because she has no trauma for Silent Hill to latch onto.
[6:32:02] <+Shonen_hero> I mean, Eddie is real
[6:32:04] <ElBuraindo> no, WHAT
[6:32:05] <MattyNezz> Laura met Eddie
[6:32:06] <DuoScratch> Silent Hill, it's only what you bring in yourself @WoolieVersus , what would a kid bring to a town like that? ;p
[6:32:06] <tux_3do> poor angela
[6:32:08] <%Tearonex> @WoolieVersus There is a version of Silent Hill the IS a real place
[6:32:09] <+clockstrings> do you plan on playing silent hill 3?
[6:32:09] <BlackLabud> The whole 3 year thing is a red herring. Mary is killed by James shortly before the beginning of the game
[6:32:09] <JeoDood> Creators confirmed Laura is real
[6:32:09] <Darren716> To Laura Silent hill's a normal town
[6:32:11] <%hereiam407> How can you just sit there and talk about pizza?
[6:32:12] <+AngelYoumou> Laura had no guilt, so she only saw the mist @WoolieVersus Silent Hill has several layers, and she was one higher than everyone else
[6:32:12] <%GameFreakerZero> Silent Hill is just a fun holiday town that James and Mary had a holiday at years ago, nothing abnormal there
[6:32:13] <%Double_Tap_That> James is the opposite of a "survivor"
[6:32:15] <+CptBritches> Laura doesn't see monsters, that's why she doesn't understand why James is surprised she's not hurt by the monsters
[6:32:15] <w_khan> Laura doesnt have trauma so she doesnt see monsters
[6:32:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, you need to ignore the SH you know. Silent Hill is a REAL place and then you have the nightmare version
[6:32:17] <KaiserMario> Laura never sees any monster, well, except for James and Eddie
[6:32:18] <%crybirb> The only ones who sees monsters are the ones who SINNED. Laura is SINLESS
[6:32:19] <+Jiggisnipe> people see different things in the town btw
[6:32:20] <VincentGraves> remember when angela said "so you see it too"?
[6:32:21] <AngryAsian5> I think it's implied that she actually doesn't see any of the monsters. She probably just sees it as a normal town.
[6:32:22] <+healnavi> Woolie seems convinced the town is illusions instead of magic LUL
[6:32:22] <Zeif00> NotLikeThis wow
[6:32:22] <+Caped_Eggy> No boat
[6:32:26] <PizzicatoFive5> Laura is there to push the "Mary is a VIRGIN MOTHER" idea
[6:32:27] <NireFuster> James adopts Laura just like Mary would've done
[6:32:27] <%Javaa01> Mary wanted to meet Laura in Silent Hill, but James killed Mary before that got to happen
[6:32:30] <GHouseduivel> She love Luara
[6:32:41] <%jinking79> kids has no guilt when they're young
[6:32:42] <GHouseduivel> Loved*
[6:32:45] <+HalloKeyori111> Boat stage time
[6:32:47] <majindusto> Mary's body is said to be in the trunk of the car at the beginning
[6:32:48] <NireFuster> >no boat stage time  Darn FeelsBadMan
[6:32:50] <Uncle_Christian> another fun filled stream
[6:32:54] <KaiserMario> Reggie! I love you!
[6:32:55] <slackerunchained> Also, even though Eddie sees 'monsters' too, it's quite likely that HIS monsters are very different than James'
[6:33:00] <Darmanimon> the town is real, but it distorts itself and the people on it to punish visitors for their previous actions, at least in this game
[6:33:00] <ElBuraindo> Mary: "i want to ask you something" adopt the girl
[6:33:02] <NireFuster> 0 boat skills
[6:33:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> All of their confusion stems from them thinking Silent Hill doesn't exist
[6:33:06] <%KellBeII> @majindusto not the trunk, the backseat.
[6:33:06] <%crybirb> Is it SIN or GUILT that brings the monsters?
[6:33:10] <dinnydanny777> Get you a girl who can boat
[6:33:12] <Dr_Mooose> 0/boat
[6:33:12] <BlackLabud> She can't row but she can do the Ocelit reload
[6:33:13] <%hereiam407> Max Speed: Null
[6:33:14] <+CptBritches> When is Silent Hill: Wave Race edition?
[6:33:15] <OuendanCyrus> Kenny's boat was stolen.
[6:33:16] <+Shonen_hero> guilt
[6:33:17] <BlackLabud> Ocelot*
[6:33:20] <%hereiam407> Did you rike it?
[6:33:20] <+Shonen_hero> sin is dumb
[6:33:20] <Uncle_Christian> PIZZA IS COMING
[6:33:20] <DrkJP520> I think what this all comes down to is: James for Smash
[6:33:29] <brunoberserk> bitch cant even swim LUL
[6:33:29] <+HalloKeyori111> Eddie likes eating pizza
[6:33:30] <jetpack_rorschasch> So what do you think Woolie? Good?
[6:33:33] <T_Sasquatch> Curfew police
[6:33:36] <$RunningNGunning> SH2 is a very rewarding Wiki dive game
[6:33:38] <majindusto> PIZZA TIME!
[6:33:40] <%hereiam407> Just gonna sit there and eat pizza
[6:33:41] <%superc37> woolie, dont overthink it. laura is as real as eddie and angela.
[6:33:41] <%crybirb> @Shonen_hero But that's what James says about Pyramid head. He says he exists to punish his sims.
[6:33:41] <PizzicatoFive5> Remember the dead guy's notes at the beginning of the game? Walter Sullivan? Angela's "for me it's always like this"?
[6:33:43] <legallyblindgamer727> WAit did catch the ned y accident
[6:33:46] <%shadowsofpain> Guilt, sin and trauma are what the magic of Silent hill uses to punish them
[6:33:47] <BlackLabud> No one else interacts with Maria other than James, either
[6:33:48] <NireFuster> The town is just evil, that's pretty much it
[6:33:51] <MrMatternot> Shiba Inu has no sin
[6:33:53] <NireFuster> Dark energy draws dark individuals
[6:33:53] <Vigogs> Laura just went there, without being drawn to it
[6:33:55] <MattyNezz> But then it's also a physical location, that people can just go to
[6:33:58] <%emMmDeeKay> this will make a good podcast
[6:33:58] <majindusto> ONWARDS  TO SH3! enigmaKEK
[6:34:00] <+tempestzephyr> The town calls to you
[6:34:00] <+healnavi> Silent Hill isn't evil! it just messes with fuckef up people
[6:34:00] <+Jiggisnipe> Laura isn't fucked up. She's just a kid
[6:34:00] <slackerunchained> I wouldn't call it 'Sin', other than people subconsiously desiring punishment for themselves... SH isn't anything like a judgemental, Abrahamic deity...
[6:34:00] <w_khan> Eddie sees his bullies, Angela see her family, Laura sees nothing
[6:34:05] <BlackermanZX> Laura doesn't see the monsters because she has no guilt
[6:34:06] <+solzan2000> is it evil tho?
[6:34:07] <dinnydanny777> Reading the Wiki LUL
[6:34:08] <%Theycallmenerf> Is Silent Hill a stand?
[6:34:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O wiki
[6:34:11] <umbraawitch> silent hill is the way it is because of alessa's powers
[6:34:15] <%crybirb> @slackerunchained That makes sense, so Guilt then.
[6:34:17] <ElBuraindo> and laura was there, it's just that James happened to find her
[6:34:18] <MattyNezz> wiki LUL
[6:34:19] <peachy996> the town preys on guilt, laura has nothing to feel guilty about
[6:34:26] <+samuraiknack> Oh shit Eyepatch Wolf is coming like Omar
[6:34:27] <jimgimp> Which one would win The Evil from Evil Dead or Silent Hill from Silent Hill?
[6:34:30] <w_khan> yep
[6:34:34] <ospreyworks> beep
[6:34:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:34:34] <NireFuster> So Maria =/= real
[6:34:34] <Zeif00> there we go
[6:34:43] <umbraawitch> picking it apart and trying to find answers for everything makes it less fun imo
[6:34:46] <jetpack_rorschasch> But she's a shit kid though.
[6:34:47] <NireFuster> Maria is a manifestation like a monster
[6:34:48] <%hereiam407> Oh, when Laura is running by Maria, 'Why didn't you stop her?'
[6:34:49] <slackerunchained> She is there simply because she wants to meet her friend.
[6:34:49] <+Shonen_hero> RIght, but James thinks of it that way in the context of guilt of what he believes to his wrongdoing. James believes he sinned
[6:34:55] <w_khan> So in the good ending you raise Laura and leave the town
[6:34:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> @umbraawitch that makes it more fun imo
[6:35:08] <%crybirb> @hereiam407 Laura doesn't see Maria.
[6:35:10] <NireFuster> @w_khan Not 'good' ending, just one of the endings, you adopt Laura and leave
[6:35:14] <+Jiggisnipe> @NireFuster yea she's like how Lisa is like the other nurses
[6:35:18] <+Iamdenril> raising laura is the best ending then
[6:35:26] <+Shonen_hero> nope
[6:35:26] <%hereiam407> @crybirb Yeh, James asks Maria why didn't she stop Laura from running away
[6:35:27] <+solzan2000> yup
[6:35:29] <MattyNezz> Silent Hill is a mirror
[6:35:30] <w_khan> i say "good" in a uplifting ending
[6:35:30] <%DoktorZee> angela was innocent
[6:35:30] <+Jiggisnipe> it's for the guilty
[6:35:30] <umbraawitch> @Melchior_the_Wise to an extent but i think it gets to be too much, not everything needs answers or theories
[6:35:32] <AngryAsian5> Pretty much
[6:35:33] <dukenux> not quite
[6:35:33] <BlackLabud> It seems to be in this game, yeah
[6:35:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> Silent Hill is also REAL. You can go there and just buy a hot dog LU
[6:35:36] <ハクア> only for people who have extreme guilt
[6:35:37] <Dio_TR> Silent hill ORIGINS
[6:35:37] <Melchior_the_Wise> The greater the darkness, the greater the torment
[6:35:38] <%shadowsofpain> She came with Eddie, the met in transit to Silent Hill
[6:35:38] <DuoScratch> Silent Hill is only what you bring with you.
[6:35:39] <+healnavi> Silent Hill itself isn't fucked up.
[6:35:40] <slackerunchained> Silent Hill is something of a 'Supernatural Mirror'.
[6:35:42] <+HalloKeyori111> Atleast in Silent Hill 2 that is the case
[6:35:44] <%shadowsofpain> they
[6:35:47] <+Jiggisnipe> @DoktorZee she still felt guilty tho
[6:35:48] <+pectusumbra> Silent Hill preys upon what's in your heart
[6:35:49] <Vigogs> in Silent Hill 1 it was a reflection of Alessa's nightmare, at least
[6:35:50] <%superc37> @crybirb thats just because james attributes his sins to his guilt. if that were the case, then angela wouldve been fine since she didnt do anything wrong and acted only in self defense.
[6:35:51] <ハクア> which is why angela was there, despite not doing anything to anyone
[6:35:52] <dukenux> Harry seen the shit that wasn't HIS construct
[6:35:52] <w_khan> And Silent Hill is also just a regular town
[6:36:01] <%hereiam407> Perfect Vacation Destination
[6:36:01] <majindusto> The Cult shit is the Exception tho
[6:36:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, the town is a just a tourist attraction.
[6:36:09] <%crybirb> @superc37 That makes sense. Yeah I accepted it's guilt, makes more sense.
[6:36:12] <NireFuster> In Silent Hill 1 and 3, it does work like that
[6:36:12] <MrMatternot> Angela super killed her Dad. And possibly others.
[6:36:13] <MattyNezz> Silent Hill is a mirror, but some poeple, like Alessa, have REALLY BIG reflections
[6:36:14] <DrkJP520> SH1 does give that impression
[6:36:15] <+pectusumbra> It is a real place. It just happens to have bullshit going on
[6:36:17] <ElBuraindo> Personal hells
[6:36:21] <NireFuster> Because that's centered around cult manipulating the energy
[6:36:23] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yeah, the regular town exists alongside the fog world and Otherworld
[6:36:24] <jimgimp> I'm pretty sure a lot of people would just die instantly upon entering from the amount of shit their carrying around
[6:36:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Silent Hill is just a regular town to neurotypical people
[6:36:26] <%KellBeII> its not evil, its just a place.  the cult is evil
[6:36:26] <+HalloKeyori111> Thats why the military never moved in? Kaufmann in 1 said the military should show up any minute now
[6:36:26] <w_khan> This is apart from SH 1/3 so its just a town
[6:36:26] <jimgimp> I know I would
[6:36:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Vigogs I think it just projects Alessa vision to a more intense degree because of the cult
[6:36:28] <%crybirb> @MattyNezz Great way to put it tbh.
[6:36:32] <%LastHazzerd> you can see why as they explain it further it gets less...... good
[6:36:33] <%superc37> Woolie we've been telling you this the entire time, silent hill IS a normal town to normal ppl
[6:36:34] <slackerunchained> Believe it or not, hundreds of people visit SH EVERY YEAR without anything bad happening to them. :P
[6:36:37] <KaiserMario> Best horror game still
[6:36:38] <AngryAsian5> Great LP guys
[6:36:39] <BlackLabud> That was lit
[6:36:39] <%Grimlockfly> It’s energy that is what you make of it
[6:36:40] <%shadowsofpain> That drug cult thing is under the surface, it's a tourist town otherwise
[6:36:40] <w_khan> YEP
[6:36:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> Thats a Video Game
[6:36:42] <%hereiam407> Hell yeh
[6:36:43] <Dio_TR> Silent Hill 2 a classic
[6:36:43] <AngryAsian5> Fuckin loved this shit
[6:36:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup
[6:36:47] <Khorneflakes_> Silent Hill just reflecting the internal psyche of a normal person, but some people have a stronger a connection like in SH 1 and SH 3
[6:36:50] <NireFuster> Yep :) That's SH2
[6:36:50] <ElBuraindo> SH1 you're seeing Alessa's hell, wading through the materialization of her pain
[6:36:52] <peachy996> Feel bad game of the ps2 generation
[6:36:52] <%hereiam407> Well.....
[6:36:54] <w_khan> SH2 is depressing as fuck
[6:36:55] <+HalloKeyori111> Well james did kill his wife
[6:36:57] <+SolGainer> It's just life
[6:36:57] <linSP> Masterpiece yaya
[6:36:58] <Dr_Mooose> wellllll
[6:36:58] <@Solidus_113> formative
[6:37:00] <majindusto> PAIN: THE GAME!
[6:37:01] <dinnydanny777> James is a bit guilty
[6:37:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> I can SUPER pin it on James
[6:37:02] <Dio_TR> I mean
[6:37:02] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Hope you guys had fun!
[6:37:03] <%hereiam407> James killed his wife
[6:37:03] <passserby> I blame the dog
[6:37:03] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> there will never be another silent hill too
[6:37:04] <Zeif00> James did kill his wife tho
[6:37:06] <Pookiedaexzile> James Merked his Wife
[6:37:06] <+tempestzephyr> pin it on the Gyromancers
[6:37:07] <VincentGraves> I mean he did kill his wife
[6:37:07] <BlackLabud> Well....other than James
[6:37:07] <+healnavi> He killed his wife!
[6:37:07] <Darmanimon> you can pin murder on James, at least
[6:37:08] <AngryAsian5> I mean.... it's a LITTLE bit James's fault... but I get you.
[6:37:09] <$RunningNGunning> BLAME THE DOG
[6:37:09] <umbraawitch> @OverzealousEuthanasiast good
[6:37:09] <Dio_TR> James did kill her wife
[6:37:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> James LITERALLY kills his wife???
[6:37:10] <%superc37> eeeeeehhhhh james DID still kill his wife tho
[6:37:10] <Fuji808> pin it on the dog
[6:37:13] <%crybirb> @HalloKeyori111 She asked to do it when angry and regreted later.
[6:37:13] <Khorneflakes_> James was his own worse enemy all along
[6:37:13] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[6:37:14] <%Prevot> it's the dogs fault
[6:37:15] <%hereiam407> THAT DOG HAD IT COMIN!
[6:37:15] <GHouseduivel> Silent Hill: Suffer me now.
[6:37:17] <KaiserMario> His terminally ill wife
[6:37:19] <+solzan2000> Eddie tho
[6:37:19] <NireFuster> James super punishes himself for killing Mary though
[6:37:20] <%townzzzzz> no one's fault Kappa OhMyDog
[6:37:20] <Vigogs> @Melchior_the_Wise less because of the cult and more because of the horrible demon in her womb, probably
[6:37:20] <%MelBrooksKA> I mean, he did kill his wife
[6:37:21] <BlackermanZX> well... James kinda fucked up LUL
[6:37:24] <%TungstenViper> James killed her
[6:37:24] <dukenux> Well, it's a bit of James fault
[6:37:25] <bleugh> it was the dog
[6:37:25] <%shadowsofpain> Eddie was pushed to an extreme
[6:37:26] <+Mr_Pylon> That dog is a CRIMINAL
[6:37:26] <linSP> It was all the dot
[6:37:26] <%livlinn> lucidHands
[6:37:27] <dinnydanny777> Oh true
[6:37:28] <peachy996> The blame is debatable
[6:37:28] <MrMatternot> That Dog made fun of me
[6:37:28] <linSP> dog
[6:37:29] <+Shonen_hero> She wanted to die
[6:37:29] <+Jiggisnipe> Eddie needed to bork bust tho
[6:37:30] <%superc37> @kaisermario still murder.
[6:37:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FeelsBadMan the Game
[6:37:31] <NireFuster> James was living a very bad situation
[6:37:32] <peachy996> on all sides
[6:37:33] <+Ancopro> yea not black n white
[6:37:37] <+HalloKeyori111> The pillow is james finishing move in the fighting game
[6:37:38] <Darren716> Yeah when she was raging out, like James may be shouldn't have taken it literally
[6:37:39] <NireFuster> It's super fucked up but it was a super ocmplex situation
[6:37:40] <Tumier> so many layers
[6:37:41] <%LastHazzerd> it was fucked up, but it was real.
[6:37:43] <slackerunchained> James definitely made some bad mistakes, but that doesn't prevent him from being a sympathetic character, still.
[6:37:43] <w_khan> Also Mary did hold any grudge against him
[6:37:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> James killed her because he wanted his life back
[6:37:43] <+Jiggisnipe> wasn't entirely compassionate either
[6:37:44] <Davimotion96> The scariest thing in Silent Hill 2 is Real Life
[6:37:45] <VincentGraves> assisted suicide?
[6:37:46] <majindusto> MIRA THE DOG'S FAULT!!! enigmaKEK
[6:37:48] <ハクア> he did out of love which is fucking crazy
[6:37:48] <w_khan> did not*
[6:37:49] <%KellBeII> Reggie needs to guest on the podcast so you guys can really take the time to reflect on this
[6:37:53] <+Shonen_hero> it's both murder, euthanasia, both?
[6:37:53] <KaiserMario> @superc37 it's called a moral dilemma
[6:37:54] <mrethanclifford> what he did may have been right, but it was also still wrong
[6:37:54] <NireFuster> Yep, yep
[6:37:55] <BlackermanZX> MVC4 with James ft. The Pillow
[6:37:55] <%livlinn> We’re not blaming dog psaPat
[6:37:56] <w_khan> yeah
[6:37:58] <+pectusumbra> Read 'On a Pale Horse' by Piers Anthony
[6:38:00] <%LastHazzerd> it's a real reaction
[6:38:00] <NireFuster> 100% Woolie, 100%
[6:38:01] <+Jiggisnipe> he did it out of love and hate
[6:38:02] <linSP> Maria’s guilt was existing
[6:38:04] <peachy996> murder or assisted suicide
[6:38:05] <+SolGainer> She was falling apart, and james thought it was a mercy for both him and her
[6:38:05] <%TungstenViper> Slent Hill doesn't care about the motives. He killed her so he feels guilt
[6:38:06] <+tempestzephyr> Momento Mori NotLikeThis
[6:38:07] <DirigibleDPlomo> i do t know man pillow use was kind of fukd
[6:38:07] <%SouLucha> It's costing to much, PULL THE PLUG
[6:38:09] <NireFuster> Many people in James' situation would've done possibly the same thing
[6:38:09] <Pookiedaexzile> But the Pillow tho
[6:38:11] <MattyNezz> Euthanasia is a super big and complex subject, and the rules and boundries of it are basically non-existent since it's so taboo
[6:38:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just blame PH psaSmug
[6:38:15] <ElBuraindo> he used compassion as his excuse, and frustration was his fuel
[6:38:22] <+LittleCinders> @woolieversus Bring Reggie on CSB to hash it out with Pat
[6:38:22] <%hereiam407> What a masterpiece
[6:38:22] <slackerunchained> Even James himself admits that his motivation for killing Mary werent entirely pure.
[6:38:24] <+Automated_Pixel> He also felt guilt for his needs. Look at the enemies in the game.
[6:38:27] <T_Sasquatch> suicide pod woooooo
[6:38:28] <ハクア> yeah, pulling the life support on a loved one is fucked
[6:38:35] <jorniev> then there's the REAL MANIFESTATION of guilt that literally hunts him
[6:38:39] <+Shonen_hero> but nor was James motivations were entirely selfish either
[6:38:39] <%crybirb> @Darren716 He was mentally exhausted. I had a pet who get really sick and did a bunch of work to take care of, some days I used to think it would be better to put him down wondering if he was suffering. He passed away peacefully and I'm glad I didn't, but the thought was present.
[6:38:41] <%kyh9> James is also a piece of shit because he hated Mary for trapping him for 3 years but he loves her too.  Human Nature is an exercise in contradiction
[6:38:44] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> but what of the UFO?
[6:38:46] <NireFuster> James did it out of a lot of things, love, compassion, frustration, rage, and he punishes himself for doing it, and Mary forgives him
[6:38:46] <%dds333a> What makes James interesting is that he is a coward
[6:38:47] <drunken_lemur> She was at home, so what plug do you pull?
[6:38:54] <%TungstenViper> you rather have Suffering or Guilt?
[6:38:56] <%superc37> @kaisermario itd be a moral delimma if james did it for a moral reason... but he said it himself, he killed her because he was selfish and bc he was tired of her.
[6:38:57] <lostallmyaccs> Yay fun game FeelsBadMan
[6:38:58] <+TheMilkiestShake> People thought that Terry Pratchetts family did something similar as he was fighting for euthanasia to be legalised in the UK
[6:38:59] <slackerunchained> @Shonen_hero Exactly
[6:39:07] <Khorneflakes_> Angela's story was messed up too
[6:39:08] <majindusto> NOW YOU KNOW...Why this game  is held in high regards
[6:39:16] <ShinyVagikarp> pengwinSuffer SH2 is just suffering
[6:39:17] <%LastHazzerd> "if you can call that living"
[6:39:17] <ElBuraindo> yep
[6:39:18] <mrethanclifford> Oh I guess we didn't get in water
[6:39:26] <%hereiam407> What's woolly gonna say now, when people mention Silent Hill 2?
[6:39:27] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Just sitting there, eating pizza
[6:39:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> game good
[6:39:32] <peachy996> good game
[6:39:32] <slackerunchained> @mrethanclifford You guess wrong
[6:39:33] <%LastHazzerd> you can take Eddie's path, you can take Angela's Path, or you can... leave
[6:39:35] <NireFuster> @mrethanclifford He did get in water
[6:39:35] <+SolGainer> SH2 is a classic and now you know why
[6:39:37] <MattyNezz> One take
[6:39:41] <Darren716> I think some people do forget that James did have some level of animosity towards Mary at the end, read up on some of the enemy designs
[6:39:42] <ElBuraindo> Leave and do some good for that girl
[6:39:43] <KingOmnicide> Great game
[6:39:43] <Uncle_Christian> leave
[6:39:44] <Cozy90> The voice actress for Mary is TOP TIER
[6:39:44] <w_khan> Its just sad that Angela end is just that dying is her answer
[6:39:45] <+Iamdenril> the letter was crippling
[6:39:49] <jorniev> REMEMBER on the medium where the good ending was killing yourself!?
[6:39:50] <Melchior_the_Wise> @mrethanclifford He got In The water first
[6:39:52] <KaiserMario> @superc37 Depends on the ending, in the leave ending Mary questions James reasons for killing her by asking him "If that's true, then why do you look so sad"?
[6:39:52] <%hereiam407> Tons of shit to pick apart
[6:39:59] <%dds333a> @slackerunchained or like the weird shit in Tales from a Buick 8
[6:40:03] <superchunk121> Watch the making of silent hill 2
[6:40:04] <mrethanclifford> @nirefuster Oh Yay!
[6:40:04] <%hereiam407> Monster designs
[6:40:06] <$RunningNGunning> This game is very rewarding for a Wiki dive
[6:40:07] <peachy996> The "REPRESS!" head tilt James does
[6:40:09] <Darren716> Legit read up on all of the monsters and what they mean, the level of detail is crazy
[6:40:11] <w_khan> I hear that letter around 8 times and i still tear up.
[6:40:12] <+Shonen_hero> There's so much about this game and there's so much fat to chew on
[6:40:12] <%crybirb> I hope he reads the justification for the Enemy Designs, they have great plot insight.
[6:40:14] <AngryAsian5> The way this game dives deep into complex emotions is amazing. It's why it stands the test of time in terms of storytelling and characterization.
[6:40:14] <+Jiggisnipe> 4
[6:40:14] <Tumier> captivating game for sure
[6:40:14] <Melchior_the_Wise> great conversation with pat for the podcast
[6:40:14] <+Shonen_hero> I love this game
[6:40:15] <drunken_lemur> Check out Cyborcat's analysis on Youtube
[6:40:16] <%hereiam407> The levels you go through
[6:40:16] <lostallmyaccs> Dude, You can talk about this game literally forever, I love it LUL
[6:40:19] <BlackLabud> Yeah, The Making of SH2 is an amazing watch
[6:40:23] <%bmoral64> Showed up to check out the VOD, did they just finish it?
[6:40:24] <majindusto> And then the HD Collection Happened!!!
[6:40:25] <bosssbatttle> they have a lot of that on the sh2 wiki
[6:40:25] <+HalloKeyori111> The LP Pat and Matt did was really good when it comes to pointing things out
[6:40:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No one won in this game. Not the characters not the players
[6:40:29] <%hereiam407> Clap
[6:40:30] <MattyNezz> "Having a triangle on your noggin would hurt"
[6:40:32] <%hereiam407> Good session
[6:40:35] <%TungstenViper> like the PYRAMID shape can be expressive of guilt and sex
[6:40:35] <NireFuster> No worries, good stream!
[6:40:35] <ospreyworks> That soundtrack sticks with you
[6:40:36] <slackerunchained> Pat is going to have a FiELD DAY, next podcast. :D

[6:41:07] <slackerunchained> Show the court just WHERE SH touched you, Reggie. :\
[6:41:08] <%hereiam407> SH3 is really good tooo!
[6:41:09] <w_khan> Shame self purgatory never came back
[6:41:10] <jetpack_rorschasch> The dead guy in the apartment sitting in front of the TV might've been James when he killed himself while watching the video tape.
[6:41:11] <%dds333a> time to go
[6:41:11] <%ChoculaUltra> I think its back to Spidey tomorrow
[6:41:11] <AngryAsian5> That letter is the realest shit there is.
[6:41:12] <+pectusumbra> It's going to be a great podcast next week. And I'll look forward to catching this stream for certain. Have a good night!
[6:41:12] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> good thoughts, but bad good thoughts
[6:41:13] <agsiar2> SH3 is back to monster world and cults
[6:41:13] <Uncle_Christian> ?
[6:41:15] <xdeathknightx> Pat slowly becoming more and more right
[6:41:15] <Tracazoid> Now you know why we fans have been talking about it for two decades and never shut up about it
[6:41:20] <%Javaa01> @HalloKeyori111 Nah, only exaggerated swagger
[6:41:21] <NireFuster> SH3 is super short if you wanna consider playing it btw
[6:41:24] <%livlinn> Amazing sesh kiichiHeadbanganimated
[6:41:24] <NireFuster> It's shorter than 1 and 2
[6:41:27] <%DoktorZee> ev3ntiLoveA
[6:41:28] <w_khan> Any donos leave for next sream
[6:41:30] <%ChoculaUltra> wait is there still like a curfew thing going on in Canadia?
[6:41:33] <DirigibleDPlomo> the journey has been great thnks for the content @woolieversus
[6:41:34] <kaidogs> im glad you guys liked it lumberjaxMonkeluv
[6:41:34] <Uncle_Christian> beer break
[6:41:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:41:34] <Khorneflakes_> The talk with Pat will be fun on the podcast
[6:41:36] <cossuoldm> Great stream, guys
[6:41:36] <slackerunchained> Nice jearb, Gentlemen. :)
[6:41:41] <BlackermanZX> this is why we despise Konami for killing SH
[6:41:42] <%hereiam407> Plus, its got all those dick monsters? Thats something, right?
[6:41:45] <Ultra_Pancake> Nice job dudes!
[6:41:47] <jorniev> NOW YOU UNDERSTAND GUILLERMO del Toro
[6:41:49] <%pungotcha> Great session, great playthrough thanks guys
[6:41:54] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[6:41:55] <brunoberserk> theres a curfew ?
[6:41:58] <DrkJP520> I did not expect this to last 7 hours
[6:42:01] <%shadowsofpain> The fact that Konami killed this series is depressing
[6:42:02] <ハクア> sh2 is a masterpiece, gut wrenching, sad and very dark but a masterpiece
[6:42:03] <peachy996> 3 will not be as deep but it is very fascinating still
[6:42:03] <NireFuster> @hereiam407 SH3? it has one penis boss I think LUL yeah
[6:42:03] <slackerunchained> I can remotely sense Pat *trembling* with excitement to discuss all this.
[6:42:04] <%hereiam407> Let Kojima make one of these with Guillermo
[6:42:13] <AngryAsian5> 7 Hour THICC boi stream tonight
[6:42:15] <%hereiam407> @NireFuster The little legged penis dudes too
[6:42:17] <NireFuster> 3 is super emotional IMO
[6:42:18] <%bmoral64> Another 7 hour stream? Damn
[6:42:22] <NireFuster> Especially if you liked SH1
[6:42:26] <NireFuster> Heather is an amazing protagonist
[6:42:27] <%BreadLM> SH3?
[6:42:32] <%hereiam407> 3 makes me cry hard as well
[6:42:41] <KahnWick> Imo, SH3 is better than SH2
[6:42:42] <%superc37> @kaisermario except the in water ending is the one that may as well be the most canon. plus, in all the ending james still admits that he killed her out of selfishness. maybe not purely, but regardless of with ending you get, it was clearly a big part.
[6:42:42] <NireFuster> Woolie is gonna love SH3 I'm sure of that
[6:42:44] <NireFuster> 100%
[6:42:45] <+Shonen_hero> the fact that Kojima was robbed of that chance makes me so mad, because it's clear Kojima understands that Silent Hill is psychological
[6:42:48] <%crybirb> @hereiam407 Why? 3 for me it feels like Aliens feels compared to Alien.
[6:42:49] <Ultra_Pancake> You could tell from Reggie's face that he was catchin some feels this session lol.
[6:42:51] <%dds333a> I don't think it's about curfew, I think it's just getting late in canada time LUL
[6:42:55] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> it's the journey not the destination
[6:42:58] <%MightyDuckShoes> @jetpack_rorschasch  There is an implication that James just keeps dying in Silent Hill and coming across his past bodies, right? I know it's likely an asset saving move, but so many bodies mirror James's journey.
[6:43:02] <peachy996> I think 1 2 3 are really good and still hold up
[6:43:03] <%hereiam407> @crybirb Heather talking about her Dad, cmon
[6:43:13] <%hereiam407> I've said enough
[6:43:13] <NireFuster> @peachy996 definitely, 100%
[6:43:15] <causewaybob> Game over yea?
[6:43:16] <+samuraiknack> I can't wait for Heather the Scientist
[6:43:19] <NireFuster> Even visually 2 and 3 hold up to this day
[6:43:20] <majindusto> Now imagine  Troy Baker as James and every character sounding straight  out of Anime...Thanks  Konami
[6:43:21] <Melchior_the_Wise> I literally can't think of a game with a more complex character relationship than SH2
[6:43:23] <%dds333a> @superc37 I get you, but it still isn't canon. still my favorite tho
[6:43:25] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[6:43:29] <%crybirb> @hereiam407 I think so, but I feel the game is less sad than 2. I don't think it even compares.
[6:43:30] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[6:43:34] <%superc37> @mightyduckshoes ive always interpreted that as sh fucking with james more than anything
[6:43:38] <%crybirb> @hereiam407 But I get what you're saying.
[6:43:41] <NireFuster> Oh god LUL
[6:43:41] <%LastHazzerd> GOD
[6:43:42] <linSP> I liked Troy Baker James too
[6:43:42] <+Shonen_hero> Troy Baker as James, bleugh
[6:43:43] <NireFuster> I would die
[6:43:45] <brunoberserk> Kill Wife : THE GAME
[6:43:46] <%hereiam407> @crybirb It's not as cerebral, but I really liked Heathers struggle
[6:43:56] <marcomatame> lmao the SA2 Maria
[6:43:57] <%LastHazzerd> the duality of chat
[6:43:58] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[6:44:00] <NireFuster> Yup
[6:44:02] <slackerunchained> @brunoberserk Wife gone... Think about wife...
[6:44:03] <+tempestzephyr> cool
[6:44:04] <NireFuster> Yeyeyeyeyeye
[6:44:06] <Khorneflakes_> sick!
[6:44:07] <%crybirb> @hereiam407 She's a great character and I loved her on Shattered Memories. The ending where Harry is innocent makes me cry hard.
[6:44:07] <KingOmnicide> Thats sick
[6:44:09] <@Solidus_113> isn't sh3 still considered one of the best looking ps2 games? the evolution of lighting tech is crazy
[6:44:10] <%dds333a> THEY DON'T FUCK AROUND
[6:44:10] <peachy996> Because you are Pyramid Head
[6:44:11] <w_khan> Technically you ARE him
[6:44:17] <brunoberserk> HES COMIN
[6:44:20] <NireFuster> @Solidus_113 It's definitely one of the most visually impressive PS2 games
[6:44:21] <+UncleMcgoo> That's a myth I thought
[6:44:22] <OuendanCyrus> Do they know you're there, though?
[6:44:25] <NireFuster> Still holds up to this day
[6:44:36] <%LastHazzerd> Obsession is dangerous
[6:44:37] <KaiserMario> @superc37 The endings are not meant to be taken as canon, they are all equally valid, and the fact that a person is pushed to the brink is what a moral dilemma is, it's not like James would've killed Mary under better circumstances
[6:44:42] <Nelsukako> wat
[6:44:42] <Eger007> shining reference?
[6:44:43] <+Ancopro> hes means like how to get the ending
[6:44:44] <dan_g_v> makes him want to take a quick swim!
[6:45:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> @KaiserMario Dog ending
[6:45:01] <NireFuster> Definitely, I think Leave is great
[6:45:07] <%dds333a> I love in Water because it's darkly wry and ironic
[6:45:10] <KaiserMario> Dog ending included LUL
[6:45:11] <peachy996> there's lots of good ending
[6:45:16] <+Shonen_hero> I think both are no more or less valid then the other.
[6:45:17] <+Jiggisnipe> new kid new wife
[6:45:21] <%hereiam407> I'd never kill myself....
[6:45:22] <+0neReeler> become the pyramid
[6:45:22] <slackerunchained> They make a point, but ancilliary evidence in future games makes it VERY unlikely that James or Mary were ever seen again...
[6:45:25] <Eger007> do you think james should turn himself in?

[6:45:28] <+Shonen_hero> They are both solid endings, just different
[6:45:30] <%dds333a> I love that one too, where Harry is just fucking dead
[6:45:36] <peachy996> My only criticism on the endings to 2 is the end song choices
[6:45:42] <%crybirb> @dds333a Yeah me too, he is even more selfish because Mary wishes him to live fully and he decides to end it all. He doesn't listen to her twice.
[6:45:48] <%kyh9> The Maria Ending is the darkest for me
[6:45:51] <+Shonen_hero> the buttrock
[6:45:55] <+Shonen_hero> god the buttrock
[6:45:58] <%kyh9> The way James almost threatens Maria against getting sick
[6:45:58] <NireFuster> Yep, same
[6:46:01] <%hereiam407> Time for some Korn?
[6:46:06] <%livlinn> Ye
[6:46:08] <+Jiggisnipe> Leave is Mary's wish
[6:46:11] <slackerunchained> ANGELAR
[6:46:14] <NireFuster> Leave feels like a solid conclusion for James
[6:46:19] <+HalloKeyori111> ANGular
[6:46:20] <%MightyDuckShoes> In Water serves the same purpose as Leave, but it does it in that Grimm's Fables kind of cautionary tale way.
[6:46:21] <%dds333a> LUL
[6:46:22] <thehijinx88> Leave is the best ending because James defeating hisi inner demons and then killing himself makes no sense.
[6:46:30] <+0neReeler> Mary probably wouldn't want him to selfharm
[6:46:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> minmaxing was not the play
[6:46:33] <Khorneflakes_> Makes sense
[6:46:44] <%LastHazzerd> that's the thing. Leave feels more natural when looking at all the cutscenes that lead up to leave
[6:46:56] <seboyo2> @KaiserMario I think each ending was made to fit with each player experience in the game, the way you get them is completly related to the way people feel the game, the story and it's characters.
[6:46:57] <w_khan> bye bye
[6:46:58] <+Jiggisnipe> they're both valid
[6:46:58] <%hereiam407> Thank you
[6:46:59] <+HalloKeyori111> Goodybe
[6:47:01] <%espanishcanamurciana> what up Woolie and Reggie.  Have yall talked about Microsoft buying Activision Blizz yet?
[6:47:02] <%crybirb> But In Water feels more directed towards how the game should be played.
[6:47:03] <majindusto> I unironically love Jonathan  Davis's song for Downpour
[6:47:03] <%LastHazzerd> Water feels like a swerve kinda
[6:47:04] <Chatterbox1991> LOVE YOU BOTH!
[6:47:04] <dukenux> gg
[6:47:05] <+HalloKeyori111> Goodbye!
[6:47:06] <Tales911> <3
[6:47:06] <+Shonen_hero> Thank you, that was great!
[6:47:06] <%jinking79> each ending is someone personal fav and that great game
[6:47:06] <ShinyVagikarp> GN Everyone
[6:47:07] <BlackermanZX> great session
[6:47:07] <%espanishcanamurciana> oh lol see ya!
[6:47:07] <DrkJP520> G'bye
[6:47:08] <linSP> bless
[6:47:09] <%hereiam407> @espanishcanamurciana Yeh
[6:47:09] <KingOmnicide> GG
[6:47:10] <peachy996> GAME OVER YEAH
[6:47:11] <agsiar2> gameover YEEEEEEAH
[6:47:11] <Tracazoid> Take care guys
[6:47:11] <BlackermanZX> Peace bois
[6:47:13] <twoto858> thank you!
[6:47:14] <slackerunchained> Ciao for now, Peeps.
[6:47:14] <%MightyDuckShoes> i wish we got an Angela substory. If only so she might have a better end. But that would have likely just been way too much psychic damage
[6:47:15] <Uncle_Christian> g night
[6:47:16] <%Double_Tap_That> See ya!
[6:47:18] <SoaringTrumpet> enjoyed my time in Silent Hill
[6:47:19] <wombatlime> YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH
