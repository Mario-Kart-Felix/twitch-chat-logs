[0:17:51] <Johannen> Pickle juice is good, not that vinegar shiz thou
[0:17:57] <SivSarcast> In the Witcher series, anti-hangover drink is called "Wives' Tears" lol.
[0:18:00] <%X2Eliah> Yeah it seems kinda random
[0:18:00] <%Juriasu> maybe the camera is just blinking Kappa

[0:20:55] <%kyh9> Field goal?
[0:21:00] <Prevot> LUL
[0:21:00] <%TheotherKristian> Lebron was 4-5 fg
[0:21:03] <%dukenux> pancake doused with maple syrup
[0:21:12] <%dukenux> This is a correct answer
[0:21:24] <iacus_> movie: ruined
[0:21:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> It took them hundreds of takes to get one where he was able to miss
[0:21:27] <%Lion_kun> Michael missed a shot once in Space Jam
[0:21:37] <%dukenux> Apparentyl Don Cheadle sucks in SJ2, which kills the last reason for me to see it
[0:21:40] <andre11dr> Yeah it's a crony, multi franchise, addpocalipse....MUCH LIKE THE ORIGINAL
[0:21:46] <%Lion_kun> Michael also cheated by stretching his arm
[0:21:48] <flipflopfoop> that's how he learned to long arm it so he won't miss again
[0:21:57] <gespenstkick> Full of memes
[0:21:57] <%X2Eliah> Tik Tok the movie
[0:22:07] <%TheotherKristian> Everyone knows Space Jam 1's use of pistols were valid equipment for regulation basketball
[0:22:07] <%Irridium> the most algorithmically designed movie it seems
[0:22:09] <%Lion_kun> Space Jam 2 is no better or worse than 1
[0:22:25] <drunken_lemur> BIG CHUNGUS!
[0:22:25] <lol_red_ranger> there are fucking matrix parody jokes in Space Jam 2 it's fucking dinosaur shit what
[0:22:29] <%Lion_kun> It is a perfect reflection of the corporate identity of the era.
[0:22:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:22:31] <Zomner> @dukenux whats up with Don Cheadle? He got an Emmy nomination us for his cameo in Falcon & Winter Soldier
[0:22:31] <Mr_Zero5232> People are a lot less forgiving of a Mary Sue character than they were back in the day, but they
[0:22:32] <@Menitta> So like how RPO was Funko Pop the movie, Space Jam 2 is Tik Tok the movie
[0:22:40] <DSD24> happened again
[0:22:43] <Mr_Zero5232> Will still see the movie
[0:22:48] <%X2Eliah> It's OK Woolie that's bothering us as well xD
[0:22:53] <iacus_> I still haven't seen the Space Jam 1 lol
[0:22:57] <@Menitta> lol
[0:23:00] <Equirah> what's getting worse?
[0:23:04] <%dukenux> @Zomner idk, heard the directing in Space Jam 2 sucked overall
[0:23:08] <%Juriasu> troubleshooting stream PogChamp
[0:23:08] <gespenstkick> Woolie breaks the camera completely in 3...
[0:23:12] <Chatterbox1991> Brain Goblins unlocked live on stream
[0:23:13] <%dukenux> or he simply didn't care, which... fair LUL
[0:23:15] <DSD24> I didn't want to watch that movie
[0:23:15] <%khalcipher> @Equirah Woolz camera is blinking
[0:23:16] <Zomner> oh man
[0:23:22] <andre11dr> Yeah i just feel that everyone has nostalgia glasses when talking about Space Jam 1 ,that movie was not that good, it's corny
[0:23:22] <DSD24> The 1st one is so funny
[0:23:25] <%X2Eliah> Is it like a mismatch between the FPS the camera is shooting at, and FPS that the software is expecting frames?
[0:23:47] <unthought> We're moving away from unnecessary 80s sequels into unnecessary 90s sequels
[0:23:49] <guiltyboya> yuuk
[0:23:55] <%dukenux> Was Coming to America 2 bad... 2?

[0:24:47] <unthought> It's incredible there hasn't been a terrible Roger Rabbit sequel.
[0:24:49] <%specters_art88> Space Jam 1 is just a 90 minute commercial.
[0:24:50] <miucsa51> And soon enough it will be only disney
[0:24:52] <gespenstkick> Dystopian kid movie economy
[0:24:58] <%Irridium> Like 9 of the top 10 highest grossing movies are Disney owned
[0:25:06] <guiltyboya> MY BRAND SHALL BE MINE crystaRage (once I'm able to dev my game outside of wageslaving)
[0:25:06] <DSD24> Was a chaos dunk in the movie?

[0:25:56] <unthought> Is Galaxy Quest 2 in the pipeline?
[0:26:07] <mrblitzstream> Disco dancing in Elysium.... Nice
[0:26:16] <%mariothemaio> @mariothemaio a complete and total failure of bungled movies and a couple interesting films here and there? sounds legit

[0:26:30] <Equirah> you.... you can
[0:26:30] <Mr_Zero5232> Did any of us watch the first Space Jam cause of the Looney Tunes characters or did we just watch it cause of the music and Jordan?
[0:26:31] <notadeasterisk> anime doesn't work

[0:26:49] <unthought> A cgi plague sweeps through Toontown
[0:26:52] <andre11dr> Can Hollywood just not make new shit? Why must we always resurrect old franchises to ruin them?

[0:27:17] <%TheotherKristian> Damn
[0:27:20] <+mechslayer71> aw fuck that, I refuse to believe a 16 year old would see Hunchback and go " eeewwww"
[0:27:24] <%dukenux> LUL
[0:27:41] <%mariothemaio> @andre11dr because new things are risks and hollywood hates risks. and anything new they do take a chance on will inevitably be absorbed into The Brand
[0:27:42] <unthought> We're due that live-action Hunchback from the Mouse
[0:27:44] <Mr_Zero5232> People who want to hate the movie have gone to see it

[0:27:52] <%derap41> @Equirah This is a 2D house!! What would you motha say
[0:28:08] <%eanscrale> I think they wanted to make another roger rabbit without the licensing issues
[0:28:15] <%X2Eliah> "Lebron James as *discount* Michael Jordan"
[0:28:16] <SivSarcast> @dukenux Cursed
[0:28:21] <%mariothemaio> @unthought can't wait for them to cut Hellfire because it's too spicy for 2021 Disney

[0:28:38] <Mr_Zero5232> Roger Rabbit is based off a book
[0:28:39] <%Lion_kun> They were both awful Woolie
[0:28:41] <%dukenux> yep
[0:28:41] <gespenstkick> Everything is already made. The only way to make new things is to remix what we have.
[0:28:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> by it's very nature its connected to other shit
[0:28:44] <Prevot> does Lebron get a shonen protag power at the end like Jordan did?
[0:28:50] <+kullumanati> Time for space jam Tony Hawk NOW!!
[0:28:56] <%Lion_kun> The best Looney Tunes movie was Back in Action.
[0:29:03] <@Solidus_113> who flossed on screen
[0:29:08] <gespenstkick> Tony Hawk's existential nightmare lol
[0:29:09] <%dukenux> Daffy Duck and Cristiano Ronaldo in Galaxy Soccer
[0:29:10] <Mr_Zero5232> Every cartoon we love is just a half hour commercial for the toys

[0:30:15] <Mr_Zero5232> You’d have to ask a Zoomer, something no one is doing

[0:30:38] <%dukenux> SUSial media
[0:30:41] <%jinking79> well they r make a movie bout Discord now
[0:30:43] <%hax_metatron> I don't see this as a bad thing at all. We're all just old, watching generational changes happen in front of our eyes
[0:30:43] <iacus_> them tiktoks
[0:30:45] <TCDerps> What is the oldest age for a zoomer?
[0:30:52] <andre11dr> I don't know, that seems reductive, there's plenty of good children movies coming out, mainly Pixard stuff
[0:30:53] <%mariothemaio> @TCDerps maybe mid-20s?
[0:30:58] <%dukenux> @TCDerps 21?
[0:31:00] <TCDerps> @TCDerps shit
[0:31:04] <%derap41> We're already virtualizating ourselves
[0:31:05] <+Stormiercashew> the cutoff is like around 97 or so
[0:31:05] <iacus_> Woolie is having his grumpy old man moment, but I don't even disagree
[0:31:08] <Prevot> zoomers right now are like early teens-young adult
[0:31:13] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @guiltyboya
[0:31:15] <DSD24> Zoomer is a real dumb name
[0:31:21] <+Bobbledygook> Zoomers are born between 1998 and 2012
[0:31:21] <Prevot> little kids are the corona generation now
[0:31:22] <@Solidus_113> pixels is the worst of the worst
[0:31:25] <%kyh9> It's Adam Sandler
[0:31:28] <@Solidus_113> it's bad adam sandler
[0:31:32] <%dukenux> What is the post Zoomer gen again?
[0:31:39] <%kyh9> Pixels is Adam Sandler making me embarassed to like things
[0:31:40] <%X2Eliah> Badam Sandbagler.
[0:31:41] <+Stormiercashew> zoomer combines boomer and gen z
[0:31:43] <guiltyboya> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:31:47] <Prevot> @DSD24 that's the point. the real name is Gen Z
[0:31:50] <+Bobbledygook> I’m at the edge of Zoomer, and even I don’t understand kids these days
[0:31:53] <%dukenux> Adam Sandler is all that crap but for millenials
[0:31:58] <unthought> Ad Mascot vtuber movie
[0:32:00] <%dukenux> *was
[0:32:05] <andre11dr> @bobbledygook Wait what, fuck not I refuse to be called a zoomer
[0:32:07] <%X2Eliah> THEY ARE
[0:32:12] <%eanscrale> Don't forget Food Fight.
[0:32:14] <%X2Eliah> RP1 IS A SHIIIIIT BOOK
[0:32:14] <+Undenizen> at the risk of sounding pretentious; your generational group has nothing to do with what year you were born in and everything to do with what culture you identify with.
[0:32:15] <andre11dr> I'm a millenial
[0:32:15] <@Solidus_113> Pixels is NOT for millennials lmao
[0:32:17] <kikoeru_san> Ready Player 1 is fucking stupid
[0:32:20] <%DkLordG> DkLordG subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! At the age of 25, I'm not sure if I'm qualified as a younger millennial or and older zoomer
[0:32:22] <%kyh9> The first one is almost about autism
[0:32:22] <%dukenux> RP1 is terrible
[0:32:25] <%livlinn> sipsipHellmo
[0:32:26] <miucsa51> SAO QUALITY WRITING
[0:32:32] <%derap41> What's funny is movies feel out of touch as a media method. Like they'd make memes with Quartets
[0:32:37] <Equirah> it's max Capitalism where just the brands become entertainment
[0:32:44] <gespenstkick> member berries
[0:32:50] <%X2Eliah> Ready Player 1 presents the WORST nerd tropes ever
[0:32:51] <DSD24> @DkLordG As a 25 year old as well I'd say younger millennial
[0:32:52] <%dukenux> @DkLordG congrats, you slip right between the cracks
[0:32:53] <guiltyboya> Don't you think that the corporate Dinosaurs are wrong, and that zoomers are people being attracted and bullied too?
[0:32:56] <%mariothemaio> You could say... I remember it so you don't have to LUL
[0:32:56] <Johannen> Best part of that book is the infiltration plot
[0:32:56] <kikoeru_san> dO U kNOw BOUT BEBOP!!!!!
[0:33:04] <%derap41> @gespenstkick even member berries are member berries at this point
[0:33:12] <%dukenux> Did you get the SHINING reference?
[0:33:12] <%kewlmyc> Reggie BibleThump
[0:33:13] <%kyh9> I'll say RP1 is more about Ernst Cline being autistic about the stuff he likes. That's why NOTHING from the 90s is referenced: Ernst Cline didn't grow up in the 90s
[0:33:14] <Prevot> if you remember the world before 9/11 you're a millenial, if not you're a zoomer
[0:33:15] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:33:18] <+nuttbrain> I can't believe they made the ultimate showdown into a real movie
[0:33:18] <%X2Eliah> yee-ouch
[0:33:27] <unthought> Think about that irrelevant book from your teens that was SUPER important to you when you read it
[0:33:31] <+ClericOfSparda> Wow
[0:33:38] <%kyh9> But is it a Diamond Dog patch?
[0:33:38] <mrblitzstream> do U Know About King Of Thieves: Jing
[0:33:43] <iacus_> perfect analogy
[0:33:43] <%eanscrale> It's the ultimate showdown with less catchy music stretched out over ninety minutes
[0:33:47] <andre11dr> No ,i would make fun of a person with that tattoo so hard
[0:33:47] <+Undenizen> shout out to the gen Xers
[0:33:48] <aewheros> Too simple, though. Do the whole hylian shield crest.
[0:33:49] <Equirah> you have *such* great taste LUL
[0:33:52] <%X2Eliah> ... How many people tatooed harry Potter's scar on their forehead, I wonder
[0:33:57] <unthought> STARLAND VOCAL BAND?
[0:34:01] <guiltyboya> "that's pretty deep man"
[0:34:07] <@Solidus_113> better or worse than getting the berserk Brand as a tattoo
[0:34:08] <%DkLordG> "that's a cool Tsushima tattoo, bro"
[0:34:09] <+Bobbledygook> @andre11dr i’ve seen a meme about “generation fucked”, the people between millennial and zoomer that vaguely remembers cassettes, remember the first ipod coming out, and the advent of youtube
[0:34:14] <+anoldtoilet> oh hell yea im early
[0:34:14] <%kyh9> I met with my gf and bonded over her playing Borderlands 2 for the first time in the year of our lord 2021
[0:34:15] <%khalcipher> i have a big seele tatto
[0:34:16] <JetpackMcQuack> nintendo fans go the fuck in
[0:34:18] <Johannen> What's wrong with that?
[0:34:20] <%dukenux> "Only reals will get it ;) "
[0:34:31] <+nuttbrain> I wonder how the kid named dovahkiin is doing
[0:34:34] <drunken_lemur> HBO Max
[0:34:40] <andre11dr> Zoomer just sounds so fucking stupid
[0:34:41] <leith_aziz> hello
[0:34:41] <iacus_> Hey I went decades without seeing SJ 1
[0:34:43] <%mariothemaio> I don't plan to get a tattoo but tbh I'd get a Disco Elysium tattoo, I'm ok with being branded by it
[0:34:44] <%X2Eliah> You could also get a Dishonored tattoo and go attack the american government building xD
[0:34:47] <unthought> Growing up, did you have any exposure to computer games of the Commodore 64 era?
[0:34:51] <kikoeru_san> @nuttbrain you mean Alduin lol
[0:34:51] <+Undenizen> @X2Eliah one time i was at king's cross station and saw someone slam themselves unflinching head first into the partition between platforms 9 and 10
[0:34:56] <%dukenux> yea, River Raid
[0:35:01] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah NICE
[0:35:02] <+Bobbledygook> @x2eliah okay that one’s cool tho
[0:35:02] <Mr_Zero5232> At the same time, all I have to do is say “love letter to the fans” and people will buy it every time
[0:35:05] <%dukenux> that's C64, no?
[0:35:13] <slix3431> @WoolieVersus I bought this game Cause of YOU
[0:35:15] <TreeLeafBoi> Three things certain in life
[0:35:17] <%X2Eliah> @Bobbledygook aye, visually it is
[0:35:19] <+nuttbrain> @kikoeru_san damn how many of these kids are there
[0:35:23] <%holydeviant1> there is no anti-pale
[0:35:29] <%Juriasu> how can you see something that has no substance
[0:35:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> But when do we GO to kingdom hearts?
[0:35:32] <%holydeviant1> literally just tossin' shit and hoping it lands
[0:35:34] <%illtima> inb4 demons starts popping out of the Pale
[0:35:34] <notadeasterisk> anti pale is the black
[0:35:38] <+mechslayer71> I just finished the church side quest and OH BOY
[0:35:39] <miucsa51> I still can't believe jackass 4 it's actually happening
[0:35:43] <kikoeru_san> we'll never know how many video game name kids there are now
[0:35:52] <%Juriasu> Åland PogChamp
[0:35:53] <%dukenux> Anti-pale would be like... concentrated knowledge?
[0:35:56] <%X2Eliah> Åland.
[0:35:59] <%khalcipher> I imagine the pale as a lack og being
[0:35:59] <leith_aziz> Åland
[0:36:01] <Sir_Yiffsalot> Its been mentioned they use radio waves to give the pale dimensions
[0:36:05] <unthought> SATW
[0:36:06] <%khalcipher> like being dead
[0:36:10] <guiltyboya> Anti-pale is Cuno
[0:36:13] <%khalcipher> but different
[0:36:22] <+Undenizen> it's not just me, right? the video feed hasn't started yet?
[0:36:23] <kikoeru_san> the Pale just IS
[0:36:24] <%derap41> chat cannot chill
[0:36:27] <%Lion_kun> Malta represent

[0:37:02] <skyenoz> Hustled out of hoboism
[0:37:09] <+Jakeofalco> eh
[0:37:11] <andre11dr> Could do GTA 2
[0:37:16] <SivSarcast> From hobo to MEGA NET WORTH
[0:37:16] <%livlinn> bring back Gay Cop spaceyeenShock
[0:37:16] <leith_aziz> I'm not sure a GTA lets play would be fun?
[0:37:18] <%Lion_kun> But I wanna see Reggie sing the N word.
[0:37:19] <iacus_> RDR2?
[0:37:22] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Saints Row is a better stream, i think
[0:37:23] <ingman112> Yeah @WoolieVersus I recommend not looking down at chat as often as you have, too easy to get hit with drive-boy spoilers
[0:37:23] <DSD24> Vice City is real good
[0:37:23] <Equirah> BPM is just a performance hit on any game you play, there's no real reason to use it either
[0:37:24] <%X2Eliah> yeah gta would be a dmca nighmare even way back to gta3
[0:37:24] <+anoldtoilet> woolie you hype for the first strive DLC char reveal tonight
[0:37:25] <leith_aziz> Maybe a Red Dead game?
[0:37:25] <Deasmeister> Is it just me or is big picture mode super low res
[0:37:27] <JetpackMcQuack> chase those quest markers
[0:37:35] <%X2Eliah> Red Ded could be fun
[0:37:36] <Sir_Yiffsalot> GTA IV is a personal pick
[0:37:37] <+YaBish311> Love this playthrough. You guys are really coming into your own here <3
[0:37:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Play Red Dead Revolver!
[0:37:38] <%Seancicle> autumn99NotSaltybruh
[0:37:38] <%derap41> Red Dead would be a good movie
[0:37:40] <@Solidus_113> cowboy simullator
[0:37:41] <andre11dr> Red Dead 2 is fucking LOOOOONG
[0:37:41] <+Undenizen> I went and did the communism vision quest. or at least i tried to. it was SO disheartening i got to that book club and went "oh god... I don't want to be a communist any more"
[0:37:42] <Chatterbox1991> Vice City, San Andreas, 4, Red Dead 1 and 2 are the ones you want to see
[0:37:49] <miucsa51> How about lego City then?
[0:37:50] <guiltyboya> Woolie would like Fallout New Vegas, I think
[0:37:53] <%DegenCat> It's not the hobocop in your playthrough that matters, it's the hobocop in your heart that counts.
[0:37:53] <+anoldtoilet> play "GUN" for ps2
[0:37:54] <notadeasterisk> did you guys played kingdom come?
[0:37:55] <DelgotHansto> You did COD
[0:37:58] <%dukenux> i think turning Rockstar games into movies is redundant
[0:38:00] <superchunk121> I had 6 hour sessions of Red Dead and made no story progress lol
[0:38:00] <+mechslayer71> the pace of red dead may not work for you either
[0:38:02] <ingman112> Halo's quality though
[0:38:02] <%Irridium> get on those GTA Online RP lobbies
[0:38:04] <kikoeru_san> halo is sick tho
[0:38:09] <andre11dr> Woolie your such a pretentious nerd, i love it LUL
[0:38:11] <SivSarcast> Heh, "Halo" "Marathon". It's a Bungie thing :V
[0:38:16] <%meniscate> meniscate subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Have either of you ever played The Return of the Obra Dinn?
[0:38:26] <leith_aziz> Red Dead Redemmption 2 controlls are a nightmare. I'll just say that
[0:38:29] <%derap41> big picture is eating a lot of GPU too
[0:38:30] <leith_aziz> Game itself is amazing
[0:38:36] <Johannen> Where the Defender of the Basic when you need him. Brennan Lee Mulligan i call upon thee
[0:38:42] <Equirah> you haven't needed BPM for controllers for years
[0:38:43] <+Undenizen> i think there's been an LP hasn't there?
[0:38:44] <%derap41> its also shit
[0:38:48] <+anoldtoilet> WoolieF
[0:38:50] <+anoldtoilet> wait no
[0:38:53] <+YaBish311> Also, did we get another Reggie rant about Price being exposed?
[0:38:57] <+anoldtoilet> woolieF lowercase
[0:39:00] <@Solidus_113> didn't they make a Sonic exe reference in RP2
[0:39:12] <%Juriasu> ready player one was like the original here we are just pointing shit out for no reason at all
[0:39:17] <%X2Eliah> woolieF_TK The *smell* of memberberries
[0:39:20] <andre11dr> BITCH, LOOK AND CLAP!
[0:39:29] <%derap41> I clapped when I saw it
[0:39:31] <spaceitaly> i like the bit in ready player two when gandalf the grey and gandalf the white and monty python and the holy grail's black knight, and benito mussolini, and the blue meanie...
[0:39:33] <%smyld> I memba!
[0:39:34] <unthought> Imagine reading a book from the 1910s remembering the 1890s.
[0:39:35] <+Undenizen> @Juriasu oh no. I think that honor goes to Scary Movie.
[0:39:36] <leith_aziz> Apparently that series is not good? I only read a bit of that in school and was not smart enough to judge the quality
[0:39:47] <%dukenux> Is RPTWO just the same but about 90s?
[0:39:57] <%krispen_wa> LUL LUL LUL
[0:39:59] <+anoldtoilet> imagine if ready player one was as good as don quixote >_>
[0:40:01] <@Solidus_113> "she has the bike from Akira!"
[0:40:06] <andre11dr> And iet ,Smash is one of the most popular games LUL
[0:40:09] <%vaderxyz1970> Member captain N
[0:40:18] <$ArCielArDor> I mber
[0:40:24] <+Undenizen> Also, Ready Player One is just westernized Summer Wars.
[0:40:26] <+anoldtoilet> i actually just got a really good translation of don quixote that explains all the refs to even older fiction because its like non stop references and theyre very funny
[0:40:27] <%dukenux> member super mario super show
[0:40:33] <unthought> "I can purchase all the simulacra of my childhood I need thank you."
[0:40:33] <leith_aziz> Interesting perspective
[0:40:36] <TreeLeafBoi> And Spider Riders in the chat?
[0:40:37] <%derap41> But Woolie remember the charleston ?
[0:40:50] <+anoldtoilet> not only is cervantes reffing knight and wizard fiction from the 1300s he's doing it wrong on purpose
[0:40:52] <%dukenux> member the Alamo?
[0:40:52] <%kyh9> But woolie, remember your first crush: Lola Bunny?
[0:40:53] <leith_aziz> as a pretty young guy, it's so interesting seeing your perspective
[0:40:54] <guiltyboya> Don't merely remember the thing... Think about it
[0:40:56] <andre11dr> YOU MEAN NORMAL PEOPLE?
[0:40:59] <$ArCielArDor> I remember spider riders, went as one for Halloween one year
[0:41:05] <leith_aziz> Maybe?
[0:41:06] <%derap41> norimes we call em
[0:41:06] <andre11dr> YES
[0:41:08] <%mariothemaio> we are absolutely jaded
[0:41:11] <%khalcipher> yeah
[0:41:12] <+anoldtoilet> and like "ah yes the epic scene where the knight of roses cut the two giants in half" and the footnote is like "this never happened"
[0:41:13] <spaceitaly> remember when robocop said the thing? remember?
[0:41:15] <+ItsRatman> Woolie you're sounding very condescending right now XD I think people just want to make casual conversation
[0:41:17] <leith_aziz> It's clearly both
[0:41:23] <iacus_> yeah it's bad
[0:41:23] <%eanscrale> Oh no, if anything you're not jaded enough
[0:41:24] <%dukenux> we might be too deep, so just pointing out the thing does nothing
[0:41:26] <+Undenizen> The charlston? like... the 1920s dance?
[0:41:27] <%X2Eliah> Yeah. The people who *would* be impressed by Ready Player One, they do not read books.
[0:41:29] <%mariothemaio> both is good
[0:41:34] <Lieutenant_Joe> Did I drop in on a discussion about Space Jam 2?
[0:41:39] <unthought> Happy Days was kind of "remember the 50s?" for people in the 70s-80s.
[0:41:39] <%hax_metatron> The problem is Capitalism
[0:41:40] <Prevot> well, a lot of people get way into shit that's not well written, like Quantic Dream games or Life is Strange
[0:41:43] <%dukenux> wdym remember Sonic, he's right there
[0:41:44] <JetpackMcQuack> now do something cool with it
[0:41:46] <guiltyboya> Chat can't handle that attitude woolieMIRIN
[0:41:51] <%hax_metatron> It's making money off nostalia
[0:41:57] <+Undenizen> @Lieutenant_Joe Ready Player One, actually, but a fair comparison
[0:42:02] <Mr_Zero5232> At the same time, everyone expects you to turn your brain off for the things they like
[0:42:11] <gespenstkick> it started with space jam
[0:42:18] <Lieutenant_Joe> Ah, even worse
[0:42:21] <%jinking79> did the main character had any character
[0:42:26] <Lieutenant_Joe> We all knew what Space Jam 2 would be
[0:42:26] <leith_aziz> Honestly, im a guy who's genuinly into GG lore and is not good at handling when people shit on it. There's not even any nostalgia involved.
[0:42:27] <+anoldtoilet> anyway what im saying boils down to, read the tom lathrop translation of don quixote its really funny
[0:42:37] <Brandon__Brando> I hate the turn your brain off excuse
[0:42:39] <%DkLordG> sometimes I think it's a little too pandering, but then it sucks me in when robot I love punches other robot I love
[0:42:45] <leith_aziz> I'd ask for tips on how to deal with that sorta shit
[0:42:45] <+nuttbrain> ban the phrase turn your brain off until we figure out what's going on
[0:42:49] <+anoldtoilet> ^^^
[0:42:50] <guiltyboya> Tru
[0:42:50] <%derap41> but Tribalism woolie
[0:42:51] <iacus_> They're fuzzy
[0:42:53] <%krispen_wa> YOURE NOT REAL
[0:42:54] <SoratheWonderful> The constant reminder and being brought to face, makes it not old news but just news. That’s why I enjoy talking about future stuff. It’s why I am now complete tired of banjo and Mario 64
[0:42:54] <%X2Eliah> Ask yourself, do you Zoom or do you Boom?
[0:42:57] <%DkLordG> that's fair
[0:42:58] <%vaderxyz1970> What is a name
[0:43:00] <%kyh9> I want to purge everyone younger than me
[0:43:03] <%derap41> Tribalism though
[0:43:04] <%Irridium> It's really quite arbitrary
[0:43:07] <andre11dr> I do agree that you can satisfy both sides, but looking down on people for not being mega nerds like you is little up your own ass
[0:43:08] <%diegobandzz> Are our eyes real woolie?
[0:43:08] <%derap41> gotta know my group
[0:43:09] <%kyh9> I:M the last man
[0:43:09] <slix3431> Hard years
[0:43:12] <iacus_> @X2Eliah Or do you Mill?
[0:43:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> BUT WOOLIE, MY POGS THO
[0:43:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but what group am i woolie?? i need to know who i belong with
[0:43:22] <gespenstkick> Nooo but the younguns are zoomers and the old ones are boomers, that means I'm cooler!
[0:43:24] <JetpackMcQuack> As generalized as it gets
[0:43:26] <+mechslayer71> nah, there are HARD boomers tho
[0:43:38] <%derap41> But in groups and out groups Woolie
[0:43:42] <spaceitaly> people born before 1995 have an extra protrusion in their skull that makes them wear unfashionable jeans
[0:43:46] <+Undenizen> Suspension of disbelief IS a thing, but if it comes at the cost of emersion then there's no point. you ignore minor plot details so that the larger ones work. if you ignore LARGE plot details, your movie is fucking broken
[0:43:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:43:47] <+anoldtoilet> if its made after 1700s its bad. the ultimate centuries boomer
[0:43:53] <Brandon__Brando> I grew up with N64 and Nintendo because that was my parents consoles
[0:43:54] <%dukenux> But @WoolieVersus how can you know if you put avocado on toast otherwise?
[0:43:57] <%Juriasu> I grew up with stuff like sailor moon and transformer because it came a bit later to my country
[0:43:57] <unthought> What if it's more region specific, like Canadians remembering The Littlest Hobo?
[0:44:00] <%Seancicle> au
[0:44:11] <gespenstkick> cringe based bringe based based cringe cringe cased
[0:44:17] <iacus_> I always feel a certain pride seeing younger Zoomers be curious and play classic games from before their time. Same as I did with games before my time
[0:44:21] <%DkLordG> I know I'll never own a house because I love avocado
[0:44:22] <andre11dr> I know a bunch a 70s movies cause my dad would make me watch them with him
[0:44:27] <%Zero_Jacks> Zero_Jacks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! being 24 i feel that age
[0:44:30] <AnneSQF> but I must belong!!!!
[0:44:36] <+Undenizen> @anoldtoilet what the fuck is this! get out of here with your "printed books"! real men hire scribes!
[0:44:42] <%derap41> the fucks MTV?
[0:44:46] <%dukenux> i had to gave up on avocados, i lost my millenial cred
[0:44:47] <%kandoh> much music vjs lol
[0:44:47] <Mr_Zero5232> People trying to decipher slang is a funny thing
[0:44:51] <%X2Eliah> .....wait MTV did vajazzles?
[0:44:52] <andre11dr> Like i got lucky enough to se the original Star Wars trilogy first
[0:44:54] <%eanscrale> people watch mtv?

[0:45:17] <%diegobandzz> I was dead lost for a minute
[0:45:20] <+anoldtoilet> oh i though you meant JFK
[0:45:21] <miucsa51> Here in latinamerica we had Locomotion
[0:45:21] <andre11dr> How gives a shit about MTV in an age of streaming
[0:45:22] <%Seancicle> be
[0:45:29] <%dukenux> oh VH1s?
[0:45:30] <%kandoh> teletoon was the shit
[0:45:30] <%X2Eliah> im gonna be real MTV is maybe too old for some of us
[0:45:34] <JetpackMcQuack> we had avril lavigne
[0:45:35] <%diegobandzz> He’s talking bout trl n shit
[0:45:38] <+anoldtoilet> i was like "damn i thought canadians would remember the president being shot"
[0:45:39] <%derap41> What's scary is its speeding up faster and faster.
[0:45:41] <unthought> Australia had RAGE
[0:45:44] <+Undenizen> MTV should no longer exist
[0:45:47] <+anoldtoilet> not paying attention for 10 seconds is fucked up
[0:45:48] <DSD24> Didn't you guys have Snit with Shang Tsung?
[0:45:49] <Brandon__Brando> @zero_jacks remember how it had the better version of Ninja warrior
[0:45:54] <%krispen_wa> G4 is coming back hosted by Xavier Woods
[0:45:55] <%dukenux> The good MTV ended when i was still in preschool apparatly, so
[0:45:57] <%diegobandzz> MTV has been pretty trash for a long time
[0:45:59] <%cache_22> What does "PJ" stand for?
[0:46:00] <+Afrobrawler> the classic
[0:46:01] <Brandon__Brando> I hate the USA one so much
[0:46:01] <slix3431> COOL GUY Here in the Zone
[0:46:08] <@Solidus_113> the era of carlos and sugar
[0:46:09] <%kandoh> BRAINWASH was my favorite morning show on the weekend
[0:46:10] <JinJun1738> BJS👀
[0:46:12] <Asuterisuku> Much significantly outlived MTV as far as actually playing music goes.,
[0:46:13] <+anoldtoilet> i remember The Box the mtv where you could call in and pay 99 cents to request a song
[0:46:14] <%diegobandzz> MTV wasn’t really targeted at kids tho
[0:46:17] <leith_aziz> Based on this conversation, am I like "uncultured" for liking GG lore but not MK lore for example? I get people feeling like shitting on it, but usually I take it personally like people insult my taste
[0:46:19] <andre11dr> In an age of streaming music, MYV
[0:46:28] <%kyh9> ADN NOW
[0:46:29] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Obra Dinn is great
[0:46:30] <+xXfuzzball64Xx> 10/10 GAME
[0:46:30] <%mariothemaio> ohhh man STREAM OBRA DINN GUYS
[0:46:31] <%Juriasu> Obra dinn is such a good game
[0:46:32] <%kyh9> THE STARS OF FORKIDS TV
[0:46:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> OOH
[0:46:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Obra Dinn is V good
[0:46:35] <leith_aziz> I heard that game is pretty unique. Great game
[0:46:36] <+CrabStealer> That'd be great LP
[0:46:38] <Lieutenant_Joe> I only ever watched MTV as a kid though
[0:46:44] <+maco_tac0> @WoolieVersus Muchmusic which was MusiquePlus in QC, we had VJ's on there
[0:46:45] <%kyh9> WILL SING THE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
[0:46:46] <mrblitzstream> the box was awesome
[0:46:53] <Lieutenant_Joe> Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory was mine and my brother’s shit
[0:46:57] <+anoldtoilet> mk lore is way more lowbrow than gg lore @leith_aziz or idk. whatever. i dont want to judge. but if mk fans are shitting on you over lore thats silly.
[0:46:57] <%dukenux> Chat would have to be in permament emote mode during Obra Dinn stream
[0:46:59] <%kyh9> TAKE IT AWAY SONIC
[0:47:11] <+maco_tac0> There was VJ Reg and Chéli
[0:47:13] <%X2Eliah> A really badly written museum piece
[0:47:18] <%vaderxyz1970> That's No Good
[0:47:21] <mrblitzstream> Room Raiders and Pimp My Ride were my shit
[0:47:22] <Mr_Zero5232> It is a strange thing where I catch myself just assuming someone not living in the States knows all about American references, I don’t like it
[0:47:23] <available_line> Woolie do you plan on ever streaming Mass Effect now that the legendary edition is out?
[0:47:30] <leith_aziz> @anoldtoilet what does "lowbrow" mean?
[0:47:31] <%Juriasu> 80's music is sick
[0:47:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> i remember thing!

[0:48:09] <Brandon__Brando> it's a great song
[0:48:12] <Johannen> Woolie is such a killjoy hipster)
[0:48:18] <%Seancicle> dah-ington
[0:48:21] <iacus_> It's different with the advent of the Internet, where everything is accessible forever and there are no "decades" anymore
[0:48:29] <+anoldtoilet> @leith_aziz like similar to "uncultured". mk lore is a very complicated b movie, its cool in a different way
[0:48:32] <Mr_Zero5232> Perfect example cause that song kicks ass
[0:48:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @johannen So....a hipster?
[0:48:40] <andre11dr> Also knowing old music is not bad, but don't pretend there wasn't trash too
[0:48:45] <leith_aziz> @anoldtoilet My issue with MK lore is more so the constant retconning and a lot of characters ending up as jobbers. Mostly NRS era storytelling. Zge family though is pretty well-developed
[0:48:46] <mrblitzstream> more like timecapsules on the internet
[0:48:47] <%diegobandzz> That song when mia oded makes the scene in oil fiction for me
[0:48:49] <%dukenux> ^
[0:48:50] <leith_aziz> *Cage
[0:48:53] <%X2Eliah> @iacus_ eh. Era os myspace, era of facebook, era of instagram, era of tiktok...
[0:48:55] <Brandon__Brando> Same
[0:48:55] <%diegobandzz> Pulp*
[0:48:55] <Johannen> @BallerSwagBro9k Yeah, i guess you got me
[0:49:12] <unthought> @iacus_ Agreed. Australia was 5-10 years behind on everything. It was weird catching up.
[0:49:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> @andre11dr The problem is that none of the trash will be lost to time anymore.
[0:49:17] <%dukenux> i listen to plenty of old music, but that's also cause a lot of the old crap got filtered through
[0:49:29] <Brandon__Brando> how the tables have turned
[0:49:33] <Prevot> watching other people play... sounds awful
[0:49:42] <%diegobandzz> My aunt used to listen kiss fm when my sister n me were kids

[0:50:18] <Mr_Zero5232> @reallybigrocks wasn’t really lost to time back then either, Hair Metal is extensively archived, that fuckin garbage is eternal
[0:50:34] <Johannen> Im into some old shit... PogChamp no way, that's a suprise
[0:50:39] <leith_aziz> I've skipped on a lot of old time music. Like GG music is based on a lot of songs I've never heard of before
[0:50:40] <TheFranss> I lived so far behidn god's back that the only radio station that was available was some shitty modern pop one
[0:50:43] <JetpackMcQuack> big black hole where university happened

[0:52:38] <inkthepeasant> that's real, TPain said on his stream
[0:52:39] <@Solidus_113> he's not wrong
[0:52:39] <%X2Eliah> that's wild
[0:52:41] <Zomner> Yeah, he said that
[0:52:41] <%kyh9> Shit really hurt T-pain's feelings
[0:52:42] <+marumariball> thats real yeah
[0:52:42] <%Seancicle> FootYellow
[0:52:43] <%mariothemaio> Yes it's real, T Pain talked about it himself
[0:52:43] <+anoldtoilet> its so fucked up lol
[0:52:44] <guiltyboya> sounds arrogant
[0:52:45] <Dopamien> tpains awesome tho
[0:52:45] <PMda2nd> true
[0:52:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> T-Pain didn't even use it to tune his voice lmao
[0:52:47] <%derap41> Not his fault
[0:52:49] <%diegobandzz> Yea
[0:52:49] <+Afrobrawler> Usher is def wrong for that
[0:52:50] <+anoldtoilet> t pain is better than usher and hes just man
[0:52:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> he used it as an effect
[0:52:53] <%diegobandzz> It’s really real
[0:52:56] <andre11dr> Well some people did cool shit with autotune ,like Travis
[0:52:57] <+anoldtoilet> yeah lol t pain can really sing
[0:52:58] <Prevot> he's out of line, but he's right
[0:53:00] <+AbnormalVoid> Usher is a chode if that's real lmao
[0:53:00] <PMda2nd> I mean true that he said that
[0:53:00] <+anoldtoilet> he did clean albums
[0:53:01] <Mr_Zero5232> Ushers career is manufactured anyway so pot to kettle
[0:53:01] <+CrabStealer> T-Pain's got a great voice though
[0:53:02] <mrblitzstream> Go watch the Netflix documentary: That's Pop
[0:53:04] <%derap41> T pain can sing he just knew where we were heading
[0:53:08] <Bonkus_Maximus_> Bruh, ya'll seen T-apain
[0:53:13] <+CutCombo> lil
[0:53:13] <%X2Eliah> Usher shoulda cussed out Cher then
[0:53:14] <+anoldtoilet> blame fucking zapp and roger
[0:53:15] <%Juriasu> it's way more hidden yeah
[0:53:15] <%epoladia> T-Pain literally just went live. Let’s ask him
[0:53:18] <mrblitzstream> He explains it there
[0:53:21] <%dukenux> YES
[0:53:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> T-Pain used it wrong on purpose Woolie
[0:53:29] <andre11dr> It became an esthetic
[0:53:34] <%derap41> Autotune was a feature instead of a crutch
[0:53:36] <Blank9> still awful
[0:53:36] <Deasmeister> Madonna was first out with autotune yeah?
[0:53:37] <+Mendin> Insidious, one might say
[0:53:38] <Zomner> @anoldtoilet lol
[0:53:42] <%diegobandzz> When tpain was doing auto tune nobody was doing it
[0:53:44] <akajaybay> there was a netflix doc on it. they were doing the pitch correction under the radar for a WHILE before it blew up as a style choice
[0:53:45] <ingman112> T-Pain's actual voice is also fucking incredible
[0:53:45] <%SomeAsianDood> T pain did it on purpose for asthetic
[0:53:45] <marcdyllan> Thats what it ALWAYS was used for
[0:53:46] <Equirah> they just don't play live shows LUL
[0:53:47] <%dukenux> T-pain used is as an aesthetic, not a cruch
[0:53:52] <%dukenux> *crutch
[0:53:52] <%vaderxyz1970> member Cher
[0:53:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Fixed :)
[0:53:54] <Bonkus_Maximus_> Ya'll heard T-Pain on Masked Singer?
[0:54:00] <andre11dr> It's used to make the music psychedelic now at days
[0:54:03] <marcdyllan> everybody autotunes, have for decades, even be T-Pain
[0:54:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Equirah Live autotune has existed for years now
[0:54:05] <%derap41> @Deasmeister Nah it was used all the way back into the 60s
[0:54:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> The REAL evil is deepfaking a dead musician's voice and we're going right for that in the future
[0:54:07] <unthought> lofi hiphop
[0:54:11] <Zomner> @Bonkus_Maximus_ apparently he KILLED that
[0:54:11] <%SomeAsianDood> T-pain is a legit singer yeah @Bonkus_Maximus_
[0:54:12] <+Sir_Louis> Its not like post production on any performance hasn't been done forever lol
[0:54:19] <kikoeru_san> brostep wubs were just edited Massive samples
[0:54:19] <Mr_Zero5232> Voice synthesizer back in the day
[0:54:20] <iacus_> Sprite flicker in NES games.... oh wait
[0:54:20] <asdief_> biz markie
[0:54:28] <%derap41> Impressionism in music is about to hit
[0:54:30] <TreeLeafBoi> T-pain is an amazing natural singer
[0:54:32] <%diegobandzz> If anything Kanye killed auto tune lol
[0:54:44] <ingman112> It's a whole new level of "choosing who gets to be famous," because you don't even need the talent anymore
[0:54:47] <Bonkus_Maximus_> T-Pain singing his soul out in a furry fit just hits different
[0:54:51] <Equirah> @ReallyBigRocks i meant what reggie said about artists that *depend* on pitch-correction
[0:54:57] <+Sir_Louis> lmao
[0:54:58] <kikoeru_san> it does
[0:54:59] <+Sir_Louis> preach it
[0:55:03] <%Burningfajitas> MBDTF is the GOAT
[0:55:05] <andre11dr> Fuck Yezzus
[0:55:06] <%derap41> AI pitch correction is what really fucks me doesn't even need to know how to do it
[0:55:08] <Zomner> just stole from Death Grips, smh
[0:55:08] <asdief_> heartles doe...
[0:55:11] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:55:12] <unthought> 15.ai
[0:55:12] <kikoeru_san> THE 808 is legit though
[0:55:14] <PMda2nd> it's alright
[0:55:15] <andre11dr> Yezzus is BAD
[0:55:18] <%Seancicle> SingsMic so I pushed him 😃
[0:55:21] <%SomeAsianDood> It's sad that he chose the Monster because people think he was a bad artist FeelsBadMan @Bonkus_Maximus_
[0:55:21] <shadowboss89> wow
[0:55:21] <Brandon__Brando> Civil War starts now
[0:55:23] <%smyld> YO
[0:55:25] <%diegobandzz> Sold GANGBUSTERS Woolie
[0:55:25] <Mr_Zero5232> One or two songs were good
[0:55:26] <kikoeru_san> TR-808 is sick as fuck
[0:55:32] <+YaBish311> Nah it’s banging
[0:55:33] <%smyld> WOW
[0:55:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Equirah Right, and they can still play live because they can autotune themselves in real time
[0:55:40] <mrblitzstream> Let the poeple be divided
[0:55:43] <%smyld> MY HEART IS BROKEN
[0:55:45] <user_naim> wronging
[0:55:47] <kikoeru_san> oh that shit is so crazy
[0:55:52] <%kyh9> There are comics?
[0:55:54] <%X2Eliah> Marvel comics went full Chad
[0:55:55] <unthought> Macromedia Flash games
[0:55:56] <%kyh9> They made comics about the movies?!
[0:55:58] <kikoeru_san> Marvel used to be...weird
[0:55:59] <%kyh9> lol
[0:56:03] <Prevot> comics who?
[0:56:03] <Brandon__Brando> or how companies just explode like blizzard
[0:56:06] <guiltyboya> What are comics? Kappa
[0:56:07] <elshadow7> Haven't read the Marvel manga yet
[0:56:11] <andre11dr> 808s was really influential tho as opposed to Yezzus wich was just struggle bars
[0:56:15] <%kyh9> Are comics like manga?
[0:56:16] <%derap41> Jocks got fucked
[0:56:23] <%SomeAsianDood> Remember when Nick Fury got a race change and no one cared in the comics?
[0:56:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> We're gonna forget why they're called comic book movies, like how people forgot what the save icon is
[0:56:25] <%diegobandzz> You saw Batman comics are now outsold by one piece LUL
[0:56:27] <+mechslayer71> wonder if they hit the military tribunal by the end of Thursdays stream.
[0:56:29] <%kyh9> You didn't realize they were the most profitable thing ever
[0:56:31] <sendart> comics? I think you mean movies
[0:56:32] <Equirah> @ReallyBigRocks from a US optic, sure
[0:56:34] <%mariothemaio> it didn't initially start that way, it was only when Disney acquired MCU following Avengers that it started to spiral out of control
[0:56:35] <+mechslayer71> mercenary*
[0:56:39] <%derap41> The NERDs With inherit the earth!!
[0:56:41] <%kyh9> Seeing Avengers in 2012 was NUTS
[0:56:50] <guiltyboya> @diegobandzz manga and anime won. For the best, I say
[0:56:50] <%kyh9> Seeing the MOUNTAIN OF FANFICTION
[0:56:51] <%mariothemaio> once Disney got MCU and Star Wars a few years ago it has been downhill
[0:56:51] <Deasmeister> And all because RDJ was charismatic as shit at the start
[0:56:53] <%kyh9> ABOUT MARVEL CHARACTERS
[0:56:56] <ingman112> You gotta wonder if they even knew, at first. Did Feige have the vision for what would happen, or was he just insanely lucky and ran with it?
[0:56:56] <%kyh9> LITERAL MOUNTAIN
[0:56:56] <PMda2nd> year one was dope
[0:56:57] <Mr_Zero5232> Too late did people realize that maybe Scorsese was right
[0:57:00] <akajaybay> any time my aprtner asks me abotu what this Marvel movie is based on it, like, it's such a random blender of things and they used thes same name, but its not really that story etc
[0:57:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Equirah what? Are you saying non-American artists don't use autotune?
[0:57:18] <Dabrikishaw> @kyh9 Yeah, there's really never going to be another feeling like it.
[0:57:21] <%X2Eliah> Marvel is the contemporary version of Star Wars way back then
[0:57:29] <iacus_> Interesting. Is that true?
[0:57:36] <%hax_metatron> FORTNITE CINEMATIC UNIVERSE coming in 20 years
[0:57:38] <andre11dr> So the future of music, HYPER POP ,it's a dark future LUL

[0:57:44] <%diegobandzz> @guiltyboya fr fr the quality n quantity is wild to me I think…especially in terms of price.
[0:57:45] <DelgotHansto> Furry Apocalypse inbound
[0:57:45] <akajaybay> every indie comic I've read the past decade has been turned into a show movie or optioned to be one soon
[0:57:45] <%kyh9> @kyh9 It's funny to me because it's basically a high-budget power rangers movie but people went and re-watched it like 10 times a person

[0:58:54] <Mr_Zero5232> Still waiting on Shadowrun to make a comeback
[0:59:01] <%Burningfajitas> at work one time, i was pining to my zoomer colleague how annoying it is when someone sends an SMS in to the tech support line because you pick up the phone and you hear nothing for a few seconds until a text to speech voice talks, and he said "jebaited", it took me a few seconds for it to register so i had to turn around and say "did you just say 'jebaited'"
[0:59:04] <andre11dr> @reallybigrocks I mean i love Sophies album, but yeah the rest i just don't get

[1:57:24] <kingra> 😌
[1:57:27] <+nuttbrain> this was in the og
[1:57:27] <heysamuel> this was voiced i think
[1:57:27] <%Double_Tap_That> It was the same.
[1:57:28] <SkinnyRite> IM SUCH A MESS
[1:57:28] <kingra> It was just this
[1:57:28] <+Bobbledygook> it was still this
[1:57:29] <%LegitBarnacleBoy> @WoolieVersus this part was in the original
[1:57:30] <+Sir_Louis> This was voiced
[1:57:30] <notadeasterisk> they had voice
[1:57:30] <+PkSilent01> This was in the OG
[1:57:30] <+ppangboi> this was in the OG
[1:57:31] <+twohitgood> it was the same
[1:57:31] <enZymeth> There was voice acting before
[1:57:31] <Ids560> this was voiced in the original
[1:57:31] <plsnolookatme> This was voice acted in the original
[1:57:32] <iacus_> these were voiced acted too
[1:57:32] <Parasocial_Interaction> It was the same, it was voiced
[1:57:32] <%Irridium> This part was voice acted
[1:57:32] <%DocDaneeka_01> Ancient Brain and Limbic were always tehre
[1:57:34] <+OverFlow82> it was the same thing
[1:57:34] <+dalmek> the original had limited voice acting, so this was in there
[1:57:35] <+JustToWatch> this was still voiced
[1:57:35] <akajaybay> this part was voiced the same way
[1:57:37] <available_line> It had voice acting
[1:57:37] <unthought> Ancient Reptilian and Limbic were in the original
[1:57:38] <spikyhyena> og had bits and pieces of voiced
[1:57:39] <%SomeAsianDood> the same. this had to be voice acted
[1:57:39] <Asuterisuku> "Dame da" ne? dame yo, Dame na no yo
[1:57:41] <+twohitgood> there was some voice acting. just not everything.
[1:57:42] <%holydeviant1> It was still the same voices. Remember, the initial version had SOME voice acting
[1:57:42] <%livlinn> spaceyeenSing joofbUWU
[1:57:43] <%Irridium> The game was still voiced just not every line of dialog
[1:57:44] <+PkSilent01> They had Voices it just most of the game is text
[1:57:44] <%TheGunrunner91> this was in from the start
[1:57:47] <meatman_noplan> it was the Same
[1:57:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> there was a bit of voice acting before, but the new version added a ton more
[1:57:52] <%kyh9> this was voiced
[1:57:52] <+nuttbrain> the original had partial VA
[1:57:53] <+askalta> same
[1:57:54] <Ids560> the original had VO for like some stuff but it was inconsistently applied
[1:58:01] <iacus_> The original game was voice acted, just only a few key lines insteadof the entire text
[1:58:05] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Kim and Cuno had quite a bit of voice acting
[1:58:06] <meatman_noplan> jermaChomp SingsNote
[1:58:15] <notadeasterisk> cunno sounded different thou
[1:58:20] <sela_what> Cuno was way more annoying in the OG lol
[1:58:22] <%dukenux> i wonder who sings the happy songs
[1:58:44] <Asuterisuku> He did Rusty Cage too.
[1:58:46] <+twohitgood> btw, this is originally a British Sea Power song called The Smallest Church in Sussex.
[1:58:49] <buffcat> Limbic version is better
[1:58:58] <+mechslayer71> I prefer OG Hurt tbh
[1:59:00] <+twohitgood> and limbic is better than reptilian
[1:59:10] <meatman_noplan> Johnny Cash doing a sad, soulful rendition of WAP
[1:59:12] <%Jeshk0> limbic is 100% the better version
[1:59:14] <%livlinn> woolieYE
[1:59:18] <+Robowar98> noo
[1:59:21] <resloxxx> @dukenux [Inland Empire] Yet is anyone happy with themselves? Certainly not you
[1:59:23] <Chatterbox1991> isnt Limbic voiced by the singer for the Gorillas?
[1:59:29] <Grimmaru> no
[1:59:30] <andre11dr> Trent apparently hated the song originally
[1:59:30] <+Robowar98> oh nvm

[2:58:04] <%dukenux> 8 months isn't even the worstbthe industry done
[2:58:05] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[2:58:06] <Demoli_PT> damn 8 months, about half of what naughty dog does
[2:58:06] <andre11dr> That's less than Cyberpunk
[2:58:16] <dave_guns> gotta sleep in the studio, how else you gonna render those Silent Hill FMV
[2:58:26] <guiltyboya> @Undenizen living dangerously, and all that
[2:58:53] <%derap41> ah yeah Lintel

[2:59:24] <%Fabpsi_> wait, so was this crab-man?
[2:59:36] <%X2Eliah> must have been the crab man
[2:59:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> CRAB PEOPLE RUIN PROJECTS
[2:59:40] <%Double_Tap_That> @Fabpsi_ No, Soona
[2:59:43] <Blackleafx> Shes also the one whos being blamed for the data-loss
[2:59:44] <dave_guns> so, there's the pale shit, sure, but is the curse real tho
[2:59:47] <%krispen_wa> Soona will look the abyss in the face and spit in it because they ruined her game
[2:59:48] <Blackleafx> So she wants to be vindicated
[2:59:51] <ingman112> Then it's just day-to-day
[2:59:54] <%hax_metatron> Yup, even one week of crunch can kill a person
[2:59:56] <JetpackMcQuack> You ate my game
[3:00:01] <dave_guns> after a while it's literally more profitable to be unemployed
[3:00:02] <Davimotion96> Good ol' Bioware magic
[3:00:03] <AlphaBankai> Everyone in Martinnaise is irradiated by past
[3:00:06] <Parasocial_Interaction> Did you reequip the thought you temporarily stopped by the way? I can't remember if you did.
[3:00:10] <dave_guns> health is wealth, boys
[3:00:15] <%krispen_wa> they did equip it
[3:00:15] <%X2Eliah> @Parasocial_Interaction he did
[3:00:15] <Blackleafx> The Sacred and Terrible Air
[3:00:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i had to leave for a bit, did he open the freezer?
[3:00:19] <Blackleafx> one mght even say
[3:00:21] <guiltyboya> @Davimotion96 oh hell no
[3:00:27] <dave_guns> squirrels chewing the cables
[3:00:27] <Parasocial_Interaction> good stuff
[3:00:35] <dave_guns> act of god says ISP
[3:00:35] <ingman112> That's where you're headed

[3:00:49] <Asuterisuku> This lady wants to MAKE THIS GAME without realizing she's making Duke Nukem Forever.
[3:01:02] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[3:01:06] <%dukenux> dev wars
[3:01:11] <TCDerps> a microwave
[3:01:11] <ingman112> You should definitely save for this btw
[3:01:17] <dave_guns> that's super shadowrun
[3:01:21] <cactus_on_fire> I think at this point she just wants to prove it wasn't her
[3:01:21] <L99minaty> that's why they use off-site copies!
[3:01:22] <%X2Eliah> That's gonna happen real soon with satellite internet
[3:01:23] <meatman_noplan> Randy Pitchford setting up in Martinaise
[3:01:23] <SaintBurke> and very poipular in this universe
[3:01:24] <codymagpie> that would be a cool sidequest
[3:01:27] <%derap41> I mean not like EA couldn't EMP Jam Ubisoft if they wanted
[3:01:38] <+Undenizen> you'd need good corporate law and a well regulated area. somewhere very much NOT like Marteneise
[3:01:42] <$ArCielArDor> because everyone else would know and would probably descend on them with pick axes and shit
[3:01:53] <Blackleafx> Plug it in?
[3:01:57] <sirrice77> start having issues with the computers, immediately look around for weird unmarked vans
[3:02:03] <andre11dr> LUL
[3:02:17] <Blackleafx> wasnt there an option to turn on the power to the ice cream machine
[3:02:19] <serioustguy> The Thought
[3:02:20] <%Jeshk0> hjemdallerman!!
[3:02:22] <Blackleafx> if you went to the generator
[3:02:22] <Trace_Bovier> is this a bug?
[3:02:23] <zanzibarian_hamster> I've heard that in the days when games were casette based, you could pirate games by just getting a quiet room, two casette players and you can fill in the blanks
[3:02:23] <OblivionSword1> physical instrument
[3:02:24] <ingman112> @WoolieVersus Maybe there's something else down here that can help the check?
[3:02:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you need phys int
[3:02:27] <elshadow7> You already had good grip
[3:02:30] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Is the refrigerator running?
[3:02:32] <%hax_metatron> THOUGHT
[3:02:32] <elshadow7> You need Phys. Ins.
[3:02:36] <+FanServ> It's still buzzing? they left it plugged?
[3:02:38] <serioustguy> oh sldo turn of the ice cream machine
[3:02:38] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus It already giving you +1 for gloves
[3:02:39] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Is the fridge on?
[3:02:39] <gespenstkick> Any gloves work
[3:02:40] <%Double_Tap_That> You already have the bonus.
[3:02:41] <hamsaddich> isn't it on?
[3:02:43] <OblivionSword1> Woolie you need physical instrument
[3:02:45] <SaintBurke> ?? yeah thats a bonus
[3:02:48] <heemwizard> did he stop the thought yet?
[3:02:52] <%derap41> Yeah its not a stat bonus its an item bonus
[3:02:53] <+FanServ> I think they need to unplug it
[3:03:01] <+illusiveSaint> that's weird it's supposed to be an automatic open
[3:03:04] <tomo_vendor> NotLikeThis
[3:03:09] <Sir_Yiffsalot> Barbell actually gives you +1 to this if you pass that check
[3:03:12] <elshadow7> That'll help
[3:03:15] <%Proxzo> does a crowbar help?
[3:03:17] <andre11dr> Yeah can't you unplug it?
[3:03:17] <hamsaddich> @illusiveSaint That's because it's still on
[3:03:20] <dextralmalin> oh good, they got wasteland of reality
[3:03:22] <+FanServ> The ice cream maker isn't supposed to be buzzing
[3:03:22] <Parasocial_Interaction> I think you can unplug it to 'defrost' it.
[3:03:23] <unthought> I can't be sober, I need to open an ice-cream machine!
[3:03:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @illusiveSaint is it? i had to roll and failed once even with the tool
[3:03:28] <SaintBurke> the thing in his hand is a super crowbar
[3:03:29] <%Fabpsi_> woolie already has the better crowbar equipped
[3:03:29] <+Undenizen> doesn't the FALN stuff help?
[3:03:36] <shincadad> You should stop sober thought
[3:03:36] <ingman112> @illusiveSaint I've never seen it automatic
[3:03:38] <%Fabpsi_> no worries, this will work out
[3:03:38] <heemwizard> so unplug it first i suppose
[3:03:42] <skyenoz> @sir_yiffsalot huh, interesting
[3:03:43] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus You may need to unplug the icebox power
[3:03:47] <SaintBurke> save scum please :)
[3:03:57] <+illusiveSaint> automatic as in an easy roll i mean
[3:03:59] <%derap41> time to fuck it up
[3:04:17] <$ArCielArDor> bitch save
[3:04:19] <heemwizard> dont think messing the box fucks anything up
[3:04:23] <+Sir_Louis> yeah, you get a plus if you leave it to thaw for a few days
[3:04:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ay

[3:12:25] <Questiy> Sword in one hand, Junkyard Dog in the other
[3:12:32] <unthought> Seems like you should be able to sheathe the sword in the multitool, like the toothpick in a Swiss Army Knife.
[3:12:32] <elshadow7> Man that thought takes a while
[3:12:38] <%Fabpsi_> imagine heaving the multitool *and* a gun

[4:12:13] <%derap41> they did it to provoke you
[4:12:14] <notadeasterisk> they where compromised
[4:12:14] <%teefpal> It was a cover though
[4:12:18] <+upandadam> nothing's perfect
[4:12:20] <%krispen_wa> They didn't trust you
[4:12:23] <%teefpal> They were acting
[4:12:25] <+mechslayer71> but that was all an act
[4:12:26] <marcheries> they didn't actually do it thought
[4:12:26] <%eanscrale> They really aren't any different
[4:12:26] <%hax_metatron> Wait till you find the whole story though
[4:12:27] <%nakunattakage> it was a cover up tho
[4:12:28] <%Vigonept> Compromised
[4:12:30] <+askalta> they really can't
[4:12:30] <Ids560> you know it was a cover though
[4:12:33] <+invida> Pretty much the regular police in America

[4:12:37] <atema128> Woolie that wasn’t real
[4:12:38] <+nuttbrain> Titus is good to Titus's people
[4:12:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> Even if it was an act, acting like that is a bit rough
[4:12:39] <%dukenux> can you tho? in a place like Martinaise
[4:12:39] <%DiscoMatador> they didn't do it tho
[4:12:41] <+Fedhas> but can you? in this town with the people you've met?
[4:12:41] <+RoByte2> Says the guy who went on a bender to end the world and wrecked a hotel room
[4:12:41] <%SomeAsianDood> tbf they were flexing to get u to leave them alone
[4:12:44] <user_naim> You take what you can get in a thirld world country
[4:12:46] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus they did that whole act cause they were trying to protect two women they considered their own. theyre loyal, willing to take a murder charge to protect people in their community
[4:12:48] <skyenoz> To be fair, they're all there are in Martinaise
[4:12:48] <%teefpal> But you found the bullet, you already know they faked it!
[4:12:50] <+NopeBadguy> could it be any worse than leaving her out in the cold like this
[4:12:51] <+askalta> fuck shanky
[4:12:51] <Parasocial_Interaction> This world aint perfect, sometimes there isn't a great choice.
[4:13:00] <heemwizard> your choice
[4:13:02] <ingman112> It’s not really a matter of picking, unfortunately. They’re all Martinaise has
[4:13:06] <%Vigonept> who else could they choose that we've seen though
[4:13:13] <+ConLin_Arts_> NotLikeThis

[4:13:27] <zanzibarian_hamster> 3 is pretty fashy
[4:13:28] <+Undenizen> i say 2
[4:13:29] <+Afrobrawler> you get a bit more lore though kinda
[4:13:30] <%krispen_wa> leave a lady with dementia out in the streets because of SPITE?
[4:13:31] <%Double_Tap_That> Kim is the one suggesting it. KIM.
[4:13:32] <%teefpal> They effectively are cops
[4:13:35] <sirrice77> they aren't cops but they are the de facto law
[4:13:35] <Ids560> yeah cops would have blown her head off because they didn't pass that check
[4:13:36] <dave_guns> they're more cops than you were for a week
[4:13:37] <+illusiveSaint> the rock
[4:13:42] <%Irridium> So you gonna throw this mentally ill woman in jail?
[4:13:43] <Demoli_PT> If KIM is suggestion, its a good choice
[4:13:50] <user_naim> They can probably help tho
[4:13:50] <OblivionSword1> they genuinely care about the community
[4:13:51] <%hax_metatron> But Reggie there are no cops here; you arriving here is a rare occurrence
[4:13:52] <graemebl> 2
[4:13:52] <atema128> So you’re gonna throw a mentally ill woman in jail?
[4:14:02] <+dalmek> a crumb of optimism

[4:14:09] <atema128> Good choice.

[4:14:37] <guiltyboya> @teefpal yeah, I felt that too
[4:14:39] <+illusiveSaint> the rcm barely exist in the town so Titus is the best bet
[4:14:40] <%derap41> pooe woman
[4:14:41] <%krispen_wa> shes alone like a bunch of the mentally ill people you can find in the streets of the average city
[4:14:41] <%Vigonept> she just said no one visits
[4:14:41] <+ALazo> she's probably alone because she's old and no one wants to take care of her like usual
[4:14:43] <iacus_> not great
[4:14:46] <%TheFabledAble> @TheFabledAble glad I didnt miss it xD
[4:14:50] <OverlordedK> Woolie's big on the failing empathy LUL
[4:14:50] <%HeroToxiko> Nah, they just left her
[4:14:53] <Johannen> Now tell Titus that the "lost" gun was in hands of ill member of his community...that you need him to take care of...that will go over smoothly
[4:14:55] <%krispen_wa> shes alone because the system is fucked up
[4:14:55] <sirrice77> im pretty sure she's just an old person abandoned by her family
[4:15:06] <%Monkeydude07> GUN SWORD
[4:15:07] <iacus_> And 2 bullets?
[4:15:08] <+AWKWARDL0SER> You look like a90s XForce character Rob Lobfield's dream
[4:15:10] <guiltyboya> @sirrice77 probably
[4:15:11] <%derap41> We need some genocidal mods in this chat real talk

[4:15:22] <%Takreth> It's just Sol's weapon
[4:15:28] <tattleworm> hand eye coord talks about cutting her hand off if you had just the sword equipped
[4:15:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> And then the multitool came up in the ability check
[4:15:31] <%Fabpsi_> You can finally run around and show everyone your gun!
[4:15:32] <%Vigonept> GUN SWORD
[4:15:33] <skyenoz> Still my heart is BLAZING
[4:15:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's a bad look to walk around with your gun drawn, probably

[4:15:52] <%X2Eliah> Btw why is the empathy stat so low, Iirc woolie had more before
[4:15:58] <Johannen> I was jsut about to mention pepperbox
[4:15:58] <%townzzzzz> 3 shots
[4:16:01] <%HeroToxiko> Isn't sols sword also a gun?
[4:16:01] <Paperware> take off the armor, you lose empathy with it on
[4:16:02] <TreeLeafBoi> 5S could have hit from that range
[4:16:09] <iacus_> That's pretty awesome
[4:16:10] <%krispen_wa> 3 shots, more than enough to kill anything that moves
[4:16:10] <FassieFons> pepperbox
[4:16:12] <Chatterbox1991> Those were a real thing back in the day
[4:16:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It loads 3 shots

[4:16:17] <guiltyboya> Gun X Swords... only lacks giant robots and a not Ada Wong as a sidekick
[4:16:17] <+Markmeltzer> It's a Pepperbox after all
[4:16:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's essentially a big derringer

[4:39:07] <AlphaBankai> That quote should give moral damage
[4:39:10] <heemwizard> The glass is very aesthetic
[4:39:12] <sirrice77> on one hand its a waste of artwork but at the same time it is a celebration of someone who did bad things

[4:40:18] <+Undenizen> no, we're looking at the saint of Delorianism - the precursor to the current government.

[4:40:28] <nelsonsaysbooya> Prolly more like a statue of an old pope who might've been a colonizer
[4:40:29] <AlphaBankai> @heemwizard because the glass depicts a political figure. Would you go to a club with a political depiction you disagree with in the wall?
[4:40:30] <Davimotion96> What if you haven't been educated to perceive that as evil?
[4:40:34] <dave_guns> she's not hot, guys, she's BEAUTIFUL in a godly level
[4:40:36] <heemwizard> a lot of people follow humanism, a lot of normal people like kim
[4:40:39] <%hax_metatron> The game told you the full context, and Kim would call it out if it's that bad. She IS a mass murderer IMO, but like ... a President is a mass murderer. Still as bad.
[4:40:41] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> But we have to preserve our heritage
[4:40:42] <%aogman> she's not fucking human

[4:44:41] <+illusiveSaint> birth rate is actually going irl, we need more sugar and pigs!!
[4:44:44] <iacus_> A position almost as dumb as ancap
[4:44:44] <%Fabpsi_> "don't be born" Well I already failed that.
[4:44:46] <AlphaBankai> Its more like he's saying that the WAY society is structured and WANTING to have children was a political plan from Dolores

[4:44:49] <zanzibarian_hamster> antinatalism

[4:44:51] <RyuuAoi> FUCK DEM KIDS
[4:44:51] <+Undenizen> it's called the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement
[4:44:52] <dave_guns> I can think of worse solutions
[4:44:53] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Antinatalism is "it's better not to exist than to exist"
[4:44:54] <brisk_dacat> adpot a kid no need to hav eone
[4:44:54] <+Mickerus> Oh fuck, she's literally a Civ player sending scouts out into the pale fog
[4:44:55] <%DashXero> Just stop making kids. 4Head
[4:44:55] <%derap41> @teefpal Humanism is great and terrible
[4:44:56] <chandlerofearth> there's also the ethical component of nobody being able to consent to existing
[4:44:56] <linSP> Noir was referring to how I took over the world as Skaven last night in TW warhammer and maxed all settlements and killed every other race

[4:45:25] <%dukenux> that's extrapolating from it, but i don't think Noid is quite an ecofash
[4:45:26] <OfficerMods> yes let zoomers be the final chapter of humanity
[4:45:31] <%MightyDuckShoes> Go ahead. Don't have kids. End up like The Pigs. Or have Kids... and end up like The Pigs
[4:45:34] <RyuuAoi> @fabpsi_ TRU
[4:45:38] <%meniscate> It's just that having children is a moral decision and you're bringing suffering to beings that can't decide for themselves

[4:47:19] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I'd do a submersible, but a submarine just feels like so much work to manage
[4:47:20] <chandlerofearth> I was in the Navy. Submarine life is hellish. Submariners are the most traumatized people i met

[5:06:21] <%teefpal> @derap41 Mmm, long bacon
[5:06:24] <%meniscate> @dukenux Noid is a classical communal anarchist just like Jesus

[5:06:38] <+Jiggisnipe> did you think left-right brain?
[5:06:41] <%mariothemaio> I think what's interesting about Noid is that he isn't really a centrist, he opts out of politics all together but in a way that the game doesn't mock the way it does for others
[5:06:45] <zanzibarian_hamster> I'm getting some serious unibomber vibes from noid
[5:06:45] <SaintBurke> the original mistake was when one man enclosed a plot of land and said "this is mine"

[5:22:50] <heemwizard> add COMPOSURE
[5:22:51] <heemwizard> for the dance
