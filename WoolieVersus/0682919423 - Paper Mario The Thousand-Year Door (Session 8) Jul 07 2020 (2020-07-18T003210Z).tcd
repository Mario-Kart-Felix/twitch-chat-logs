[0:41:17] <+the_krypto_knight> Mario is investing the fortune he made as a good trader
[0:41:19] <superf1nebeam> are we really doing a mogul move
[0:41:21] <Venchair> Don't get hp plus
[0:41:22] <xUrbanCarnage> Les do eet
[0:41:24] <hassanico2> Sorry to ask, is chapter 3 finished?
[0:41:26] <KasiCrafter> FP plus?
[0:41:27] <GenericSoda> @run44forrest he left to get 500 piantas
[0:41:28] <the1ax2man3> Level is the on of the BIGGEST lvl you can get
[0:41:28] <Syrushmx> become filthy rich woolie
[0:41:29] <Run44forrest> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:41:30] <DopeyDragon> FP
[0:41:30] <JetpackMcQuack> big brain moves
[0:41:32] <Warbot40> wait they leveled up flurrie?
[0:41:33] <%andrex2311> FP
[0:41:38] <Papa_Bearman> Buying Gold Bar x3 would leave him with...what? 155 left?
[0:41:39] <%Lunatyr_> He's still on chapter 3 @hassanico2
[0:41:40] <Venchair> Hp plus literally costs a full level's worth of fp
[0:41:43] <+Ancopro> 3
[0:41:46] <%ringabal> 3 points
[0:41:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> 3
[0:41:47] <hassanico2> @Lunatyr_ thank you
[0:41:47] <Venchair> IT COSTS 3
[0:41:47] <Papa_Bearman> 165, sorry.
[0:41:48] <%chosenjuan42> Just give HP
[0:41:48] <Zebroneath> Dont tell him
[0:41:50] <%blaze__drag> 3
[0:41:51] <bbblaketwitching> its always 3
[0:41:51] <%doombawkzvs> @WoolieVersus Invest fully in gold. Bribe opponents. Hire goons. That's how Mario Wars is played
[0:41:52] <+Ancopro> the cost of a level
[0:41:53] <%andrex2311> 3?
[0:41:54] <Run44forrest> wooooolieeeeee
[0:42:00] <Brutalyte616> Just buy everything.
[0:42:04] <Venchair> Hp and FP plus are a minor way to respec
[0:42:07] <noe_juan_kanobe> Not worth it, IMO
[0:42:08] <%blaze__drag> it's basically respecing a level
[0:42:11] <%jinking79> just pick a top tier
[0:42:15] <niozonbi> Basically a level's worth of BP for a level's worth of FP
[0:42:17] <%GrassCannon> Merluvlee
[0:42:22] <%ekodrop> buy oil
[0:42:23] <%ringabal> 50 coins max
[0:42:24] <Prevot> if you have leftover money get the magic
[0:42:25] <JoviLovesYou> Grind some more and buy them all, coward.
[0:42:26] <%chosenjuan42> 3 bp is the same as 5hp when you level
[0:42:28] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 50 for max
[0:42:29] <+the_krypto_knight> We’ve is purely better if you have the hp and fp badges available. It just means you can trade the stat boos whenever
[0:42:29] <vaderxyz1970> The 50 option is perminate
[0:42:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> The HP and FP Badges give one level worth while using one level of BP. They're basically a flexible respec.
[0:42:36] <Papa_Bearman> Buy baseball cards and keep them mint.
[0:42:40] <%MontresorMeal> how does the don even profit from this set-up
[0:42:41] <FacetiousAF> whhho's world is this
[0:42:49] <+Sliverits> this is a lot of thinking for paper mario
[0:42:58] <DopeyDragon> Merluvee
[0:43:03] <+i_heart_gaming> lol
[0:43:04] <%MontresorMeal> is this a money laundering thing
[0:43:06] <%chosenjuan42> 50
[0:43:07] <KasiCrafter> Or...TWO sets of gold bars?
[0:43:08] <%Solidnick18> um
[0:43:11] <Papa_Bearman> Merluvlee tells you hints.
[0:43:15] <bbblaketwitching> that last one
[0:43:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> Gold into oil
[0:43:21] <%Vikingdeath1> your plans are good, sir
[0:43:24] <%Cozy90> i just got here what have i missed?
[0:43:30] <Venchair> all in on gold
[0:43:38] <FacetiousAF> street math: 10% luck, 20% skill, 15% concentrated power of will
[0:43:39] <%Indigo_Automaton> Can you actually buy two set of x3 gold bars?
[0:43:40] <Papa_Bearman> @Cozy90 Woolie pulled a Bezos off-screen and stockpiled all the Piantas in the game.
[0:43:40] <Esparsenior> @montresormeal sure Mario gets the big win, but he’s in with the Don. It’s everyone else that gets scammed. ThATs where the coin is made!
[0:43:50] <Papa_Bearman> @indigo_automaton No, he only has enough for one.
[0:43:55] <GenericSoda> @cozy90 woolie's crippling gambling addiction
[0:44:03] <powerprotoman> buy gold twice
[0:44:04] <%MontresorMeal> @Esparsenior yeah that makes sense
[0:44:08] <FacetiousAF> 234*2=468
[0:44:09] <DopeyDragon> @papa_bearman Ah, thanks. I can't remember the names of all the fortune tellers.

[0:53:32] <%DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus Power Plus is too goddamned good
[0:53:33] <hassanico2> Do copies of Happy badges stack?
[0:53:40] <dinosiurry> Flower Saver's got a 4 bp cost though, which is pretty high
[0:53:40] <+Sliverits> Woolie's entire strategy seems to revolve around resource efficiency
[0:53:43] <niozonbi> You already have attack up P anyways
[0:53:44] <noe_juan_kanobe> Bigger number is simple
[0:53:49] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> but pekaboo
[0:53:51] <Drusain> They stack thouigh
[0:53:52] <vaderxyz1970> yes
[0:53:57] <+AsinPersuasion> @hassanico2 yes but i think it just increases chance of regen
[0:54:00] <+AsinPersuasion> not how much
[0:54:05] <hassanico2> aw
[0:54:10] <+AsinPersuasion> or it might be the other way

[0:56:35] <bbblaketwitching> that is a name
[0:56:37] <Esparsenior> Time for more WWE fights
[0:56:38] <%ringabal> You mean Kingdom Hearts?
[0:56:42] <%MonsterEnvy> In Hunter x Hunter they go to Battle Olympia.
[0:56:44] <+LoVezineTheAir> battle nexus?
[0:56:47] <+LoVezineTheAir> tmnt?
[0:56:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> Battle Olympia
[0:56:52] <%doombawkzvs> HxH
[0:56:54] <%KyoryUtchy> I mean, isn't that just Valhalla?
[0:56:56] <+Thunderhog> ...did we talk to Luigi again?
[0:56:59] <dizimous> Kingdom Hearts has Olympus Collosuem
[0:57:00] <the1ax2man3> Their is a block you can break
[0:57:07] <+Someone_Kooky> @monsterenvy They LAMPSHADE battle olympia
[0:57:09] <the1ax2man3> I think it leads to shine
[0:57:10] <extradopeness> Let everybody know and SUCKAS BE WARNED that THIS is the outcome when ya mess with Bullhorn
[0:57:13] <hassanico2> 21 BP goddamn
[0:57:33] <hassanico2> How does sorting badges work?
[0:57:33] <+thunka10> Drop happy heart would be my pixk
[0:57:36] <DopeyDragon> Battle Olympus is apparently the name of an NES gamr
[0:57:39] <brachydios777> One of my favorite quotes from the Black Dynamite show is “ Deal while you can cause that light turned mother fucking green. Bye bitch!”
[0:57:40] <%chosenjuan42> Sort that screen
[0:57:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie is stalling so he doesn’t have to ruin his throat with the Vince voice
[0:57:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHATS FIRE DRIVE
[0:57:46] <Shadope342> and yet he requires MORE bp
[0:57:47] <+Fnir> Battle Olympus ? umu umu
[0:57:50] <+krispen_wa> I've come to declare war on those who would sell drugs to the community
[0:57:51] <%SomersaultJustice> take off happy heart
[0:57:52] <%ekodrop> battle of olympus is a nes game
[0:57:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sorry caps
[0:57:54] <warp_zoner> YO FIRE DRIVE IS BEST
[0:57:56] <+AsinPersuasion> never enough bp
[0:57:58] <Drusain> Fire Drive does an attack to everyone + burn
[0:58:02] <rwbyfan25> you can take off power bounce cause you barely
[0:58:14] <warp_zoner> Fire drive is worth it
[0:58:14] <Run44forrest> do you really need hp plus
[0:58:17] <damienlunas> BP for the BP God
[0:58:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> when did he get fire drive?
[0:58:25] <SixthSun2> Psst, maybe sort your badges?
[0:58:26] <+LoVezineTheAir> fire drive is crazy good
[0:58:31] <$tkuwari> HP PLUS is a waste
[0:58:33] <noe_juan_kanobe> Can't badges be rearranged?
[0:58:33] <extradopeness> But Black Dynamite, I sell drugs to the community!
[0:58:38] <Esparsenior> BP is king. It can give you HP or FP
[0:58:49] <warp_zoner> Fire drive basically breaks ground level fights
[0:58:53] <Venchair> Chaaaarge
[0:58:55] <damienlunas> Z-Button to sort
[0:59:08] <%chosenjuan42> partner
[0:59:19] <SpeedyCloud17> quick change takes a lot :o
[0:59:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> Always take BP. The HP Plus and FP Plus Badges are basically respecs.
[0:59:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:59:20] <%chosenjuan42> Mario has more options
[0:59:29] <+the_krypto_knight> The hp recharge usually doesn’t amount to that much healing anyway. Better to bulk heal and it’s specials or items
[0:59:29] <twieetcha> CoolCat
[0:59:35] <hassanico2> It's Free Turns isn't it?
[0:59:37] <DatAsuna> it's non optional
[0:59:38] <+Dimfish> by far
[0:59:38] <+Sliverits> best badge in both games
[0:59:38] <SpeedyCloud17> !MOTIVATED
[0:59:38] <@Moobot> 1385 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:59:38] <%Solidnick18> keep that
[0:59:39] <dinosiurry> "O.J., you better be careful with that knife, or one day you might write a book about how you allegedly took some white bitch’s life!"
[0:59:41] <DopeyDragon> Quick Change is essential
[0:59:42] <%Solidnick18> it's the best
[0:59:45] <%astrofalcon1> quick tag
[0:59:57] <%Solidnick18> looks good
[0:59:57] <%GrassCannon> swap out W Emblem Kappa
[1:00:02] <brachydios777> @extradopeness I can always appreciate a Chocolate gitty uuup quote
[1:00:06] <glass_marcus> Take off power bounce
[1:00:07] <%MonsterEnvy> Battle Olympia.
[1:00:12] <damienlunas> As you get more partners, Quick Change becomes better and better
[1:00:12] <%MonsterEnvy> From HxH

[1:00:44] <+Dundee15> Technically you don't need to put levels in HP or FP if you're willing to spend money on those HP and FP badges. You'll get more customization in the long run but it will drain your coins buying those badges.
[1:00:46] <bbblaketwitching> sorry, Zess-T
[1:00:50] <%Proxzo> Remember to clean out the sewer after each chapter with your new stuff. Blocks/Walls etc

[2:00:54] <KingSuje> i feel unloved
[2:00:55] <%cdrom321> Probably following the delivery vehicle.
[2:00:56] <xUrbanCarnage> Woolie! Since ur playing old GameCube gems, have you ever played the 2.5D action platformer/punchout-like/ Rhythm game known as Donkey Kong Jungle Beat?
[2:00:57] <%SirGO0SE> yo thats a hustle

[2:01:15] <DatAsuna> but yeah fuck em
[2:01:17] <+gespenst25> its probably the Montreal package Mafia
[2:01:17] <%SomeSageAdvice> and those food delivery people sure like taking stuff that doesnt belong to them like FOOD
[2:01:19] <heart_ablaze> I hope there is a special circle in hell for package stealers
[2:01:21] <brachydios777> Something about petty thieves that especially piss me off
[2:01:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just put a medusa head in a fake package to prank those package thieves.
[2:01:23] <%tigerfang86> WHO WOULD STEAL DURING QUARENTINE

[2:01:38] <%kinetikpaws> Yo make sure you don't get your VR headset stolen
[2:01:42] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The food delivery is more likely since its from another company. Package delivery less likely. But its still possible.
[2:01:42] <+Grayhammatter> that's fucked
[2:01:45] <KingSuje> i'd steal a body splash
[2:01:47] <Prevot> fuck that's right, fuckers are out during quarantine stealing shit

[2:02:07] <%Mr_Ease> holy shit bullet dodged
[2:02:11] <%ChoculaUltra> that's why I try to never order shit around Black Friday - Holiday Season. It gets super bad around that time.
[2:02:12] <bbblaketwitching> and courage
[2:02:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> People put in more work to steal and be lazy than to actually put in some work

[2:03:23] <%SirGO0SE> @cobalt_phoenix_ you're only responsible for your own imo
[2:03:25] <+harrisboe> @dinnydanny777 Decency should be the default. Only treat someone badly if they show they don’t deserve decency
[2:03:26] <%SomersaultJustice> boo that person!
[2:03:26] <+regis_j_rock> @NopeBadguy I think it just keeps going, I remember losing once

[2:03:59] <%dinnydanny777> @harrisboe I mean, I've seen those videos of the "Karen's" we have people like that in our society as well

[2:04:09] <+NopeBadguy> So Bowser just beats you and fucks off LUL
[2:04:09] <%SirGO0SE> its the ultimate test
[2:04:10] <brachydios777> Put it back every time!
[2:04:12] <Potatoidea> People leave it in the middle of the road?
[2:04:12] <%prime_name> JUST PUT IT BACK ITS NOT HARD
[2:04:13] <Iwashi94> wait people just leave shopping carts?
[2:04:13] <JacktheMan18> I mean, you can be different and be able to treat people decently

[2:04:17] <Iwashi94> I never seen that
[2:04:19] <%Livelinne> MercyWing1 woolieREGGIEFUL BegWan
[2:04:19] <JacktheMan18> Oh yeah
[2:04:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> SCUM
[2:04:20] <+Deano8817> assholes do
[2:04:20] <+Grayhammatter> RETURN IT YOU FUCKS
[2:04:21] <%Nomad94> Ha, we don't have that problem in Germany because of the deposit
[2:04:22] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I normally put it back or at the cart spot
[2:04:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> FUCKING SCUM
[2:04:23] <Potatoidea> Yeah
[2:04:23] <%jiggy_snipe> it is an interesting test
[2:04:23] <%Doplghost> arrrrrrrgh people who leave shopping karts
[2:04:25] <+tokenreefer> 90% of the time lol
[2:04:25] <%doomerskeletor13> As someone who worked at a grocery store, fuck those people
[2:04:27] <thetrashman_sc> I WAS PAID TO DO THAT
[2:04:31] <thetrashman_sc> FUCK THOSE PEOPLE
[2:04:31] <Triplicat> stealing the shopping cart is obviously -1/10
[2:04:32] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> The really good people steal the cart and give it to the homeless.
[2:04:32] <papershuriken_0> having worked as a someone who puts them back, so many people are assholes
[2:04:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Do you go out of your way to put away someone else's abandoned cart? Extra credit.
[2:04:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you leave shopping carts, I should be allowed to key your car.
[2:04:34] <+UberWolfman> FUCK THOSE PEOPLE
[2:04:36] <thetrashman_sc> THEY'RE GARBAGE
[2:04:36] <%mechslayer71> I put it back, it takes 15-30 seconds
[2:04:37] <%gatorafan> DansGame
[2:04:37] <citerel> i don't leave it in the road
[2:04:40] <NotHereToStream> In the UK you need to put a £1 coin into the trolley to use it, so if you leave it out randomly, you lose that £1, so it incentivise people to return the carts
[2:04:43] <%SomersaultJustice> my mom had to pick those up
[2:04:44] <brachydios777> People need a slap in the face
[2:04:44] <%MontresorMeal> Leaving shopping carts at the entrance is chaotic neutral
[2:04:44] <damienlunas> My dad leaves the cart where it is; I can confirm he is an ASSHOLE.
[2:04:45] <papershuriken_0> it's ridiculous
[2:04:48] <+PianoAlone> true
[2:04:50] <+Creggamonsta> putting the cart as a kid was pure bliss
[2:04:51] <tttruest> it is how you act when no one is watching
[2:04:51] <Potatoidea> No law, but you have to live with the guilt of endangering others
[2:04:51] <$tkuwari> its so far tho
[2:04:53] <+Jessie_Lockhart> IF i leave it leave it in a spot that it doesnt block spots or will roll away
[2:04:53] <Esparsenior> The excuse that some else is paid to do it is actual BS.
[2:04:54] <Torgue_1> @thetrashman_sc THOSE PEOPLE GAVE YOU A JOB
[2:04:55] <%Nomad94> @NotHereToStream Same in Germany.
[2:04:57] <%BinaryFireball> Woolie read reddit the other day haha
[2:04:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, putting it on the curb doesn't count. TAKE IT BACK TO WHERE IT BELONGS
[2:04:58] <%Solidnick18> i always put it back
[2:04:59] <warp_zoner> Well, shit im an asshole
[2:05:03] <+Viaquez> i take back other carts while taking mine backk
[2:05:03] <noe_juan_kanobe> I always had fun putting shopping carts back as a kid
[2:05:04] <%dinnydanny777> Leaving shopping carts outside your house is the peak dickheadery I've seen
[2:05:05] <%starzo0> I WILL
[2:05:06] <+Juriasu> I will
[2:05:07] <%dinnydanny777> Or in a river
[2:05:08] <Gallhint> I had to have medicine for my sick cat shipped to me. It was only high strength antibiotics and a cream to help her appetite. It was stolen. She died. Fuck porch pirates and everything they do. Some of the worst people to ever exist.
[2:05:08] <%Chatterbox1991> that's a lot to read into a shopping cart...
[2:05:09] <%ChoculaUltra> same goes for just holding the door open for people who are clearly behind you and entering the same place
[2:05:09] <Shroomtastic64> Shopping Cart Test is golden. completely agree bois
[2:05:10] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s like a corral every few feet for Christ sakes
[2:05:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "BuT tHeY pAy PeOpLe fOr ThAt"
[2:05:12] <%Invlux> I will
[2:05:15] <%jiggy_snipe> @Solidnick18 you're a good guy Nick
[2:05:16] <tttruest> even if someone is watching you leave the cart they will look the other way
[2:05:17] <%Invlux> while I'm working
[2:05:17] <%dinnydanny777> I have seen shopping carts in rivers and outside of houses
[2:05:18] <+TheOneCalledRock> what about the people who see the cart pusher and then push the cart TO THEM to put it away?
[2:05:20] <Ookamiden02> Always put it back too
[2:05:21] <+Creggamonsta> ride it back. see it stack up with the other carts
[2:05:23] <NeroInfinite> Yeah, fuckers are literally 2 feet away from the return spot and they just LEAVE the cart out for no reason.
[2:05:26] <DatAsuna> chatter you're the type who would abandon it
[2:05:30] <%Doplghost> that's why you have the pound coin system in karts. you have to return the kart to get your money back
[2:05:30] <%BinaryFireball> best personality trait indicator is to play a game with them
[2:05:31] <tttruest> LUL
[2:05:33] <+Ether101_Prime> Another test is if you blame Mako for Korra being abusive.
[2:05:33] <%Exiliator> You wipe your ass before you shit?
[2:05:35] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:05:35] <%dinnydanny777> I have literally seen shopping carts that people have dumped in rivers or taken homes
[2:05:36] <+Grayhammatter> LLU
[2:05:36] <%SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:05:37] <%SirGO0SE> ass pubes DansGame

[2:05:42] <%jiggy_snipe> you use public restrooms?
[2:05:42] <+Creggamonsta> sry about ur cat
[2:05:42] <%Nomad94> I've never seen a single person leave their kart in the middle of nowhere
[2:05:43] <+Jessie_Lockhart> That is fair
[2:05:45] <brachydios777> Wipe your god damb seat
[2:05:46] <mike2hands> ass etiquete
[2:05:46] <%SuperKirby24> how hard do you wipe that you leave asspubes on the seat? cmonBruh
[2:05:49] <%almightychad> the seat, Chat, the seat
[2:05:50] <%prime_name> Or people who COAT the seat in piss.
[2:05:50] <Esparsenior> In England, for most carts you have to put a £1 coin into the cart so it incentive
[2:05:52] <+madtalon> I always put the cart back and if theres one on my way to the corral i grab it too.
[2:05:53] <%almightychad> foolish chat
[2:05:55] <xUrbanCarnage> as someone who was paid to get carts, ur a huge piece of shit for not putting it in the designated spot in the parking lot

[2:05:57] <%doomerskeletor13> @cobalt_phoenix_ It’s so dumb, they make the baggers do it and they’re supposed to grab the carts from the corrals
[2:05:57] <Potatoidea> Oh
[2:05:58] <+Dimfish> feces and shopping carts arent similar
[2:06:00] <+linSP> you wipe?
[2:06:03] <%dinnydanny777> Public restrooms are gross
[2:06:04] <%starzo0> i just dont poop in public, i shit at home where its safe
[2:06:04] <%Solidnick18> i'm just gonna wait till i get home
[2:06:04] <PkSilent01> What if you use the bathroom naked
[2:06:11] <%Solidnick18> @jiggy_snipe thank you
[2:06:12] <A_CD_By_Thomas> All of these next ones can be tough, stay frosty
[2:06:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, go get fucked if you do it
[2:06:20] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Man the bathroom horror stories I got from a coworker
[2:06:21] <%jinking79> their those asshole that leave them on the parkin space know a car is waitin for them to go
[2:06:22] <+Fenrisulfr_V> I don't think I've shat in a public place in over 5 years.
[2:06:25] <thetrashman_sc> yes it is
[2:06:25] <%Invlux> Yes it is
[2:06:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> YES IT IS
[2:06:27] <%ringabal> "You stand when you wipe?" "Yeah, doesn't everybody?"

[2:06:34] <skyheys> Devil's Advocate: You leave the cart so more people have jobs
[2:06:34] <%SirGO0SE> it takes 5 seconds

[2:06:39] <%emperordread> Apathy is DEATH
[2:06:40] <%kingkeldeo31> The next 4 fights are real neat
[2:06:41] <%gatorafan> wipe your shopping carts, don't leave the poop on the middle of the parking
[2:06:41] <Potatoidea> Always lay TP on the seat in public restrooms if they don't have the plastic covers
[2:06:43] <%MontresorMeal> what alignment is leaving a shopping cart in the parking lot, on its side
[2:06:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> STOCKS, put them in THE STOCKS
[2:06:44] <bbblaketwitching> and what is apathy chat?
[2:06:46] <NeroInfinite> I generally do not poop in public, and if I do I never sit on the toilet.
[2:06:46] <+Dimfish> everyone should stand when they wipe
[2:06:47] <%psidefx> @ringabal huuuh?
[2:06:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Throw rotten fruit at tme.

[2:07:21] <%kingkeldeo31> Good, you can't jump on him anyway
[2:07:21] <Shwepie> They helped people so they can tell others they are a good person and bask in their approval.
[2:07:23] <Papa_Bearman> Not jumping will be easy for this fight...

[2:07:41] <HereComestheChief> NO FLIPS, JUST FISTS
[2:07:46] <Zalthia> Because I want validation and for the workd to fucking notice me for once
[2:07:47] <%astrofalcon1> I think if you want to help someone then do it, just to do it
[2:07:49] <%Nomad94> Good people don't brag about how good they are
[2:07:54] <+Ether101_Prime> That man's got a spear.
[2:07:54] <%ChoculaUltra> real g's move in silence like lasagna.
[2:07:57] <NotHereToStream> do it for the sake of goodness, not ego
[2:08:00] <Shwepie> @hassanico2 What did the study say?

[2:27:52] <OperatorJo_> psa3guy
[2:27:53] <%RadicalWeegee> TIME TO SELL
[2:27:53] <%tigerfang86> Partners need MORE POWER
[2:27:53] <shiny_prinny> because it's EVERY partner
[2:27:54] <+regis_j_rock> That's the only way to increase Partner HP outside of levels so that's the cost

[2:27:55] <%ringabal> Koops get cucked again

[2:27:58] <witchwoodstock> deals 1. 4 damage
[2:28:01] <HairyRavioliToad> Every partner tho
[2:28:02] <Papa_Bearman> HP Plus P is 6 because it's +5 to all your partners.
[2:28:03] <Esparsenior> BP
[2:28:03] <+LoVezineTheAir> it buffs all your partners tho
[2:28:06] <%blaze__drag> it makes some sense, it buffs like 6 people all for +5 hp
[2:28:08] <skyheys> it's worth more than actual hp +, wtf woolie
[2:28:10] <+regis_j_rock> HP Plus for Mario is just a respec basically
[2:28:14] <bbblaketwitching> 5 hp for all partners is very good
[2:28:14] <terrordriver01> PogCha
[2:28:21] <%kingkeldeo31> appeal is pretty useless
[2:28:22] <niozonbi> It's plus 5 to all partners, so it's really +20 right now
[2:28:27] <+pectusumbra> oh, it's ALL partners, yeah, that makes sense
[2:28:28] <+linSP> it’s 5 hp * # of partners
[2:28:43] <skyheys> It's to EVERYONE
[2:28:45] <bbblaketwitching> and in your backround

[2:28:52] <%kingkeldeo31> EVERYONE
[2:28:53] <%dinnydanny777> So VIOLENCE gets 15 hp
[2:28:53] <shiny_prinny> yeah not that great, but that's why it's expensive
[2:28:54] <Cynical_Canadian> It's good, but I never found I needed it
[2:28:55] <%ringabal> We in the [REDACTED] vents now
[2:28:58] <%exnuart> +20 health
[2:28:59] <skyheys> so that's +20 woolie

[3:11:56] <%doombawkzvs> Cheer500 It's funny because in that fight you literally wouldn't have been able to win if you ate the cake. If the stipulation was "partner attacks only" and you have no partner then it was GG. It was his own fault for eating cake that wasn't for him. Cull the meek.
