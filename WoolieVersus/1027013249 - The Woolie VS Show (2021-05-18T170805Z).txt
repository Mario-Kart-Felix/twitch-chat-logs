[0:03:33] <iacus_> and they haven't got into the union
[0:03:34] <WeepyDevil> since they don't want to become a Semanese supremacist, and didn't want to try punching out Jean Luc
[0:03:36] <capjordo> Glad to see everyone back in the Woolie hole
[0:03:40] <servicesuspension> Oh shit I'm getting my 5G nxt week

[0:04:11] <servicesuspension> I completely forgot, jezus,
[0:04:11] <WeepyDevil> @benupde287 haven't crossed the river...iirc its still day two
[0:04:37] <servicesuspension> they're still pretty early in the game. Try not to name characters or events in case they haven't seen them yet
[0:04:49] <leith_aziz> Why does this song remind me of those drama shows I sued to watch as a kid?
[0:04:49] <WeepyDevil> yeah
[0:04:58] <leith_aziz> *used
[0:04:59] <capjordo> Sussy bucket
[0:05:14] <WeepyDevil> pat named a character woolie doesn't know yet, although woolie probably glossed over it lol
[0:05:20] <servicesuspension> Oh shit Chrono Trigger
[0:05:28] <heemwizard> how long does it usually take for the stream to start
[0:05:38] <leith_aziz> @heemwizard 10 minutes I think
[0:05:40] <servicesuspension> Depends, usually about ten
[0:05:43] <heemwizard> alright thanks
[0:05:45] <servicesuspension> they're setting up
[0:06:19] <leith_aziz> I tend to play Fighting games in my free time, but I feel a bit burned out right now. Anybody feel the same?
[0:06:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:06:42] <capjordo> I play rocket league so I stay burned out in general
[0:06:49] <griffgrundlepunch> *I slam my spaghetti bowl on the table, spilling sauce and spaghetti all over myself* I want Woolie N O W!!
[0:07:05] <capjordo> Lol
[0:07:07] <%ekodrop> ekodrop subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! ngl not feeling great about open beta 2... we'll see...
[0:07:34] <leith_aziz> I mained Sol in the beta, so I had tons of fun. Just don't nerf him Arcsys, you hear?
[0:07:41] <linSP> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:07:58] <griffgrundlepunch> But I definitely feel burnt out. I live in the states and my mom's got co-morbidities, so the past year has been spent watching the news like I'm a DBZ bystander.
[0:08:08] <+fuhbree> I was playing Anji and Ky mostly
[0:08:10] <dds333a> Arcsys gives and takes away LUL
[0:08:13] <leith_aziz> @griffgrundlepunch The news? Oh god
[0:08:31] <servicesuspension> I want to see my boy lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi from the 57th precinct of Revachol Citizen's Militia
[0:08:54] <dds333a> Sol could very easily be on the chopping block, and he's gotten it before, but never particularly badly Kappabadly
[0:08:59] <DatAsuna> rashiddooooo
[0:09:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RASHIDOOOOOOOOOO
[0:09:04] <available_line> LET'S GOOOOO
[0:09:23] <leith_aziz> @dds333a To be fair, I don't really see anything that needs nerfing fast aside from Far S
[0:09:34] <leith_aziz> That's not what makes him fun.
[0:09:58] <%andrewofbob> Shotos tend to be the starting point for a FG's development and balance...

[0:12:24] <dds333a> Perfect timing
[0:12:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:12:27] <leith_aziz> It kinda sucks that when a new fighting game comes out, we always worry about it and talk shit on it till the next game comes out. Sometimes it's fair, but you hardly find the FGC ever unified outside of Smash I guess
[0:12:27] <servicesuspension> LUL
[0:12:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> V
[0:12:35] <DatAsuna> ahhh, woolie with the bootlegs

Long time tipper first time subber. I'll just ask it here, what is everyone's beef with the 3D Mortal Kombat games? Is it just that it's not 2D? or that 3D inherently makes for a less serious game?
[0:14:37] <%gatorafan> VERY GOOD

[0:16:54] <DatAsuna> the day I get too old to handle gnocchi is the day I lose my smile

[0:20:02] <%ekodrop> i felt neutered
[0:20:11] <servicesuspension> I can't get over how ugly the lobby is :(
[0:20:13] <andre11dr> I mean, i played Sol and he felt like he lost shit but they gave him new
[0:20:20] <leith_aziz> Fair enough
[0:20:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:20:29] <leith_aziz> We can all agree on that
[0:20:30] <yomamma133713> I mean if you're having less fun than before that's still probably a negative change
[0:20:35] <%Lion_kun> Fix it by removing it.
[0:20:37] <linSP> they still got that flash game lookin ass lobby huh
[0:20:54] <EternalJedi> yomamma133713 not in all cases
[0:21:02] <+SignScratch> does strive have PC cross play?
[0:21:16] <EternalJedi> yomamma133713 if you're having fun with a completely busted character, a needed nerf isn't a negative
[0:21:27] <leith_aziz> Here's my thoughts for now. Sol was hella fun and people seem to like Ram and I-No to some extent. If they stay the way they are, I'll enjoy it
[0:21:31] <Equirah> @SignScratch nope cause Sony
[0:21:32] <Johannen> Is it Free2Play and does it run on potato PCs?
[0:21:39] <buffcat> !uptime
[0:21:40] <@Moobot> @buffcat WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 21 minutes and 50 seconds
[0:21:41] <andre11dr> Just make the blood gain less fast and his fine
[0:21:43] <Defm551> i just wish the beta was a bit longer, i only had time to touch 2 fighters
[0:21:49] <dds333a> Incrementally, or quickly
[0:21:58] <+invalid_robin> this was my first and holy shit I loved Guilty Gear. wish the beta was longer
[0:22:07] <iacus_> I hope Sega does something with Virtua Fighter
[0:22:08] <Lancaster_H> all they have to do is text menu lobby and crossplay
[0:22:16] <leith_aziz> It does feel a bit sad that once again we find Veterans kinda disliking the game when casuals are having the time of their lives. Wish we would be unified for once
[0:22:31] <Fuji808> hi what is this stream for?
[0:22:38] <leith_aziz> From what I've heard, SIGN had it's issues as well
[0:22:40] <Johannen> That is fair thou
[0:22:41] <dds333a> The most final iterative release
[0:22:43] <@Menitta> "SF4 is trash compared to 3rd Strike"
[0:22:47] <andre11dr> @iacus_ Don't worry, im sure will get another DOA someday
[0:22:49] <@Menitta> "Nah SFV is trash to USF4"
[0:22:59] <%buff_shiba> buff_shiba subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Sup dudes.
[0:23:00] <leith_aziz> And yep. People hated SF4 at the start
[0:23:10] <servicesuspension> Virtua Fighter is part of the Yakuza series
[0:23:12] <leith_aziz> They kept talking about SF3 instead
[0:23:13] <%Juriasu> sfII is so bad, sfI is the real shit
[0:23:19] <Picia000123> they never compare the thing to the vanilla iteration, which is wrong to do
[0:23:19] <Fuji808> I came cuz it said Disco Elysium, is this a DE stream and they're talking fighting games, or is this a fighting game stream? Either way I'm here.
[0:23:22] <andre11dr> Isn't it tho?
[0:23:28] <Equirah> Only buy fighting games at the end of their life, got it LUL
[0:23:29] <leith_aziz> When SF3 came out, people hated it
[0:23:34] <%Juriasu> @Fuji808 they'll start soon
[0:23:36] <leith_aziz> Same thing, same thing
[0:23:39] <%gatorafan> @juriasu that triggered me, thanks imaMad
[0:23:40] <iacus_> @Fuji808 it's the DE stream, don't worry
[0:23:41] <andre11dr> I compared Strive to Sign
[0:23:44] <yomamma133713> @fuji808 strive beta just happened so they've got stuff to discuss first
[0:23:52] <Fuji808> Ok, thanks for clarification
[0:24:00] <Picia000123> @Equirah you are kinda not wrong, but that's with all games LUL
[0:24:09] <+HodouVAN> meanwhile in monster hunter: why doesn't rise have as much content as G-rank Iceborne World with post-release additions?!
[0:24:12] <andre11dr> And yeah i think Sign was a more hype game than Strive
[0:24:13] <Blank9> but why not strive be a revision of rev2
[0:24:20] <%andrewofbob> What's the count of versions for BlazBlue, extends etc. included?
[0:24:39] <andre11dr> It's not like Sign felt less than +R
[0:24:45] <Lancaster_H> its not a very good way to get in new players though, example being SFV being so fucky at launch
[0:24:47] <leith_aziz> In the end, I am glad Guilty Gear finally got the attantion cause that's what I wanted from the start. If I don't end up liking it at the start, I'll be happy for the sales
[0:24:58] <%Seancicle> compari in furtum gaudium
[0:24:59] <+SignScratch> every new fighter sucks.  because new is never better than old. we should all be playing ST
[0:25:08] <servicesuspension> Guilty Gear is bigger than ever, I've never seen so many people interested in one
[0:25:14] <dds333a> It's especially apparent with the extremely distinct beast that is GG, where multiple games in the series are very different
[0:25:20] <andre11dr> In like 2 years LUL
[0:25:39] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr That was because SIGN was closer to +R in design. Strive is designed to be a bit more different. The issue is that it's the first attempt for them
[0:25:39] <Equirah> @HodouVAN World launched using same content update method: "what?! that's it? no grank?"; Rise launches using same content update method:  "what?! that's it? no grank?"
[0:25:40] <Robot_Nixon_> my life is ruined because the video game doesnt do what I want BabyRage
[0:25:45] <dds333a> they're bad
[0:25:46] <Iwashi94> NRS animations are kinda bad
[0:25:47] <Blank9> mortal kombat had 4 bad 3D games in a row
[0:25:50] <dds333a> That's it
[0:25:52] <servicesuspension> I still hold that Shaolin Monks was good
[0:25:54] <Blank9> until 9
[0:25:57] <leith_aziz> @servicesuspension ^
[0:25:59] <griffgrundlepunch> I started with Deadly Alliance and I can tell you it's jank as fuck.
[0:26:09] <Johannen> Is GG big or just big in FGC?
[0:26:10] <Fuji808> When SF6 comes out, people will be talking about SF5 favorably. It happens with every SF game. New comes out, old gets pedastal'd.
[0:26:16] <griffgrundlepunch> Shaolin Monks is what the Mortal Kombat movie should have been tbh
[0:26:25] <+OblivionSword1> it's not that 3d is bad it's just that the game itself is bad
[0:26:25] <andre11dr> Yeah NRS animations are kinda wierd, but i think MKX plays really good
[0:26:25] <leith_aziz> I know the MK fans like the 3D games cause of the lore. Also the 3D games also had some great music
[0:26:27] <SolSwagGuy56> What kind of cop is Sol Badguy
[0:26:35] <yomamma133713> I wish they at least had a vague grasp on how they want to balance the game right before launch.
[0:26:39] <Equirah> @Johannen cult following in FGC
[0:26:42] <andre11dr> Oh wait he meant the PS2 games
[0:26:48] <servicesuspension> The terrible animation is a deal breaker for me. At least the original games had actual people as models
[0:26:49] <yomamma133713> I don't want to have to wait 6+ months for it to get fun

[0:27:10] <leith_aziz> Unfortunately, animations in MK games are still bad for the most part
[0:27:12] <Rojahh> MKX is the definition of broken but Just  balls out fun
[0:27:20] <griffgrundlepunch> Not to mention the fatalities looked like everyone was full of Strawberry Nerds.
[0:27:31] <servicesuspension> We need Cole Young DLC

[0:27:35] <leith_aziz> Yeah, X is redicillous, but there is a lot of fun in it
[0:27:38] <andre11dr> To be fair so where a lot of fighting games around the 2000s
[0:27:49] <yomamma133713> I really enjoyed Mkx, but mk11 felt way worse to me.  Not sure why
[0:28:07] <%jinking79> I'm always hearing +R Sol so much better than Xrd ,Rev 1 & 2 and Strive Sol ruining the character

[0:28:19] <andre11dr> Tommy wasn't even a designer
[0:28:21] <iacus_> oh you think it's a CHOICE!? (jk)
[0:28:30] <andre11dr> His just a fucking musician
[0:28:32] <Equirah> nah
[0:28:41] <leith_aziz> Many 2D games flopped cause of that
[0:28:43] <%gatorafan> I'm pretty sure that mentality still remains in some places sajamDelay
[0:28:48] <leith_aziz> Which is a shame
[0:28:58] <dds333a> @solswagguy56 very much boring. single minded, gruff, abrasive, and silent. add "unpersonable cop" to the list
[0:29:05] <servicesuspension> That ruined Chrono Cross :
[0:29:08] <servicesuspension> :(
[0:29:10] <%kyh9> HONEY BEE INN IS SERIOUS
[0:29:20] <dds333a> I don't play that Nintendo Kiddie shit
[0:29:30] <andre11dr> And then DMC said " games should be serious, but nahhhhh"
[0:29:54] <leith_aziz> From what I understand the 3D fans don't like it for the gameplay
[0:29:54] <Johannen> Some of my friends still think any kind of pixel or non-photo realisitc look looks bad
[0:30:01] <%Juriasu> I have a friend who made me play deadly alliance way too much
[0:30:11] <%gatorafan> @andre11dr I mean.... DMC2 was kind of serious???
[0:30:12] <dds333a> Yup
[0:30:22] <servicesuspension> @Johannen a lot of them do, to be fair. Lots of devs use it as a crutch
[0:30:33] <andre11dr> @gatorafan We don't say those words around here
[0:30:34] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Then you got DmC... But hey, we got DMC5 now
[0:30:39] <yomamma133713> It's harder to balance 3d than 2d just straight up.  Not many reasons to make a competitive 3d fighter over 2d.
[0:30:54] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz We don't say those words either
[0:31:18] <servicesuspension> Shujinko, Bo Rai Cho, Kotal Khan and Meat. What else do you need
[0:31:24] <leith_aziz> Animation-design either it seems
[0:31:30] <griffgrundlepunch> Don't forget Hsu Hao and Mavado.
[0:31:32] <%gatorafan> one day I'll get my hands on that Bomberman game sajamDegen
[0:31:34] <EternalJedi> photorealistic graphics take resources that would be better served elsewhere
[0:31:49] <%Juriasu> they still don't lol
[0:31:53] <AvroEltz> mk animations are trash
[0:31:55] <EternalJedi> photorealism gets dated, an artstyle can be eternal
[0:31:59] <andre11dr> But for real, DmC would've been cool if they just made their own thing instead of ruining Dante like that
[0:32:02] <Deko_> LUL
[0:32:02] <leith_aziz> That Stance button.....WHY?
[0:32:24] <@Menitta> I want a fighting game character that feels like you're playing Nioh
[0:32:29] <andre11dr> I mean there was Tekken 5
[0:32:30] <+SignScratch> how long till MK changed the KO stand up again?
[0:32:41] <andre11dr> Thet came out in 05
[0:32:48] <leith_aziz> That is the dumbest button yet
[0:32:59] <dds333a> tbf, photorealism was very much MK's brand
[0:33:01] <%smyld> I’m playing a vinyl and reggies movement went along with it too well
[0:33:16] <andre11dr> What vinyl?
[0:33:26] <andre11dr> What you bumping
[0:33:27] <leith_aziz> You're using up a button! You could use that for anything else!
[0:33:37] <Chatterbox1991> i mean that's a minor thing button wise so whatev
[0:34:04] <leith_aziz> Lot of MK players actually don't know of crossups because of that. Wait till they play a game like DBFZ
[0:34:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IT AINT OVER YET
[0:34:15] <%smyld> Marcos Valle
[0:34:26] <%Juriasu> hey, salt party tomorrow PogChamp
[0:34:33] <leith_aziz> (im not harping on the players. Its more how NRS kinda created a seperate issue)
[0:34:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:34:35] <dds333a> MMX
[0:34:41] <dds333a> NotLikeThis
[0:34:43] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz I mean Sonic Fox played DBFZ and he bodied everyone
[0:34:50] <Johannen> When i hear crossups i imagine people throwing cross-like fireballs
[0:35:10] <dds333a> cmonBruh
[0:35:12] <+wendisky> Playing disco and have found myself in a predicament that I’m sure will fuck these boys up
[0:35:18] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Sonicfox doesn't play just MK. He's played DBFZ, GG Strive and Tekken 7
[0:35:30] <clack14> and skull gurlz
[0:35:39] <+Mrbaconator> sonic fox just plays fighting games
[0:35:40] <andre11dr> After MK tho ,pretty sure he started with MK
[0:35:49] <servicesuspension> My first fighting game was a bootleg Mortal Kombat for a russian famiclone console
[0:35:50] <DatAsuna> Was it Minh's first?
[0:35:55] <%Juriasu> whoa, he's wearing jeans PogChamp
[0:35:59] <%TubeMan642> I started with DMC 2 and hated it
[0:36:03] <dds333a> Midair gun combos, hell yeah
[0:36:15] <Johannen> There was Mortal Kombat on Dendi? WUT
[0:36:16] <Rojahh> TBF treat like theres no where else to go but up in that series
[0:36:17] <leith_aziz> I remember playing that Incredibles game as a kid and loving it. Now I'll probably hate it
[0:36:21] <Chatterbox1991> I started on Deus Ex: Invisible War and i like it the most of all of the ones ive played
[0:36:26] <andre11dr> I started with 4, I was so confused LUL
[0:36:34] <neostria> my first character action game was Chaos Legion
[0:36:43] <neostria> it was... somrthing
[0:36:46] <Virokwet> As someone who started with Dmc: Dmc i can vouch for this
[0:36:51] <dds333a> @rojahh except DMC1 in leagues better than DMC2
[0:36:54] <Johannen> @neostria Is that the one with summonable warrios of different types?
[0:36:55] <dds333a> LUL
[0:36:58] <%kyh9> "[Sequel Game] is a GREAT place for newcomers to jump into the series".  The eternal lie
[0:37:06] <neostria> @Johannen yup
[0:37:15] <EternalJedi> Johannen Fate?
[0:37:16] <leith_aziz> @Virokwet To be fair, there's a lot to dislike about DmC, but its a decent action game on its own
[0:37:20] <coreybom> A lot of this generation started on DmC original. Not Definitive, the original janky one. But People start at different points, nothing wrong with that.
[0:37:21] <%kyh9> All of them?
[0:37:22] <leith_aziz> You could do worse
[0:37:25] <leith_aziz> Batman
[0:37:25] <Rojahh> @dds333a there maybe a few bumps on the road there lol
[0:37:26] <@Menitta> Mission Impossible
[0:37:31] <DatAsuna> that's any old reboot
[0:37:31] <@Menitta> Technically
[0:37:33] <%kyh9> Star Trek?
[0:37:34] <%insomniacCoder> are we going to do the arch of honour
[0:37:41] <Johannen> @neostria I didnt know i could swap them so i think i got stuck on like 3 or 4 encounter where i had to use gunners)
[0:37:42] <%kyh9> Superman?
[0:37:42] <DatAsuna> star wars lol
[0:37:43] <servicesuspension> Oh that's the worst. When people know the thing but not the thing the thing's based on
[0:37:44] <heartlesshealer> are talking about weird times to jump into a series and love it? Like loving Roy's Fire Emblem game where ALL the missions were Seize?
[0:37:52] <+Jeshk0> is it the Star Wars prequels?
[0:37:54] <dds333a> @rojahh in some ways, but 2 is worse than 1 by an order of magnitude
[0:37:55] <DatAsuna> yeah fire emblem too
[0:38:06] <%Lion_kun> It's also inferior lol
[0:38:10] <dds333a> '03 is still good
[0:38:12] <@Menitta> Cuz I know old fans of the OG Mission Impossible HATE the first Tom Cruise movie
[0:38:14] <andre11dr> I never even seen the old one
[0:38:18] <%SivSarcast> Me playing DMC2 as the first game: Wow, these SMGs are so powerful. Who needs a sword?
[0:38:20] <EternalJedi> with the original anime series, I had no idea Edward's preferred weapon was a spear
[0:38:20] <%kyh9> Hey...remember that time that Ed and Al took down the NAzi regime?
[0:38:22] <DatAsuna> brotherhood is more of a mixed bag than people say
[0:38:23] <+metzselaar> Three Houses was my first Fire Emblem
[0:38:24] <%Lion_kun> Manga is the only worthy version
[0:38:24] <dds333a> FMA:B is better, however
[0:38:25] <leith_aziz> I only knew of Fire Emblem when 3 Houses came out. So my expectations are pretty high
[0:38:29] <%kyh9> REMMEBER SHAMBALA?!
[0:38:29] <Blank9> jump into MGS at 4, duh
[0:38:32] <andre11dr> Ive only seen brotherhood
[0:38:33] <Equirah> Brotherhood changes too much which is weird considering LUL
[0:38:33] <DatAsuna> People are just focused on it fixing the ending
[0:38:38] <dds333a> Melissa is still the best
[0:38:41] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> If you read the manga you don't need to watch brother hood its juts badly paced manga
[0:38:45] <DatAsuna> but the show isn't just an ending
[0:38:45] <andre11dr> Because it's the superior one
[0:38:51] <servicesuspension> Many things nowadays have the same name as the original because it helps with SEO
[0:38:57] <DatAsuna> also yeah manga readers need not check in
[0:39:00] <Rojahh> @dds333a how I see if DMC 2 Is your first first then the next DMC game you plays just gonna be more fun no matter what
[0:39:02] <%Juriasu> I feel like brotherhood is only regarded so well because it is clearly better than og FMA which was still a great series
[0:39:03] <%KetsuoTaberu> FMA:B really benefited from the original series existing because it had less work to do for character development
[0:39:04] <Johannen> Seen both, Brotherhood is the one  that stuck around cause it was the one that made sense with the ending)
[0:39:13] <neostria> @Johannen if i remember correctly the western release's normal mode was actually the  hard mode of the japanese version. I gave up pretty early on that
[0:39:17] <DatAsuna> Netherealm will NEVER stop using UE3 lmao
[0:39:18] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> 2003 FMA is better then brotherhood anyways
[0:39:19] <dds333a> @rojahh oh, absolutely
[0:39:23] <servicesuspension> Remember, Castlevania is an anime on Netflix... what games?
[0:39:25] <+SignScratch> I finished FMA right before brotherhood came out
[0:39:29] <DatAsuna> PS5/Series X UE3 let's go
[0:39:31] <emeraldskrull> I only play MK for the story
[0:39:35] <@Menitta> Everyone has a different point of reference.
[0:39:37] <+Exicuren> Well, while it's not a reboot, SMT series and Persona franchise
[0:39:40] <andre11dr> MK9 is broken, but in a fun way
[0:39:47] <yomamma133713> Watching all of fma, then all of brotherhood is the way to go
[0:39:48] <leith_aziz> as a mode, yeah. In terms of lore, don't know wether to agree
[0:39:50] <andre11dr> Like MK9 i wacky
[0:39:51] <leith_aziz> Sol?
[0:39:54] <deviljhojho_> no
[0:39:54] <leith_aziz> What?
[0:39:56] <Rojahh> RIP Warner games
[0:39:57] <Dogking16> MK 11's story is shit. Aftermath is even worse.
[0:39:58] <%Juriasu> that man monkaS
[0:39:59] <servicesuspension> bedman is important, right?... right?
[0:39:59] <AvroEltz> THAT MAN
[0:40:00] <heartlesshealer> =)
[0:40:00] <EternalJedi> and the Castlevania animation studio is doing a He-Man reboot with Mark Hamill voicing SKELETOR
[0:40:03] <dds333a> cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh
[0:40:04] <Equirah> @DatAsuna spoken like someone who doesn't work in the industry
[0:40:04] <Johannen> @servicesuspension My buddy only known Castlevania for its "remake" that was sorta recent, and was confused to when are we going to the future)
[0:40:09] <leith_aziz> Asuka litterarly started everything
[0:40:09] <%jinking79> Zoning in netherrealm always boring
[0:40:15] <andre11dr> Raven?
[0:40:19] <%kyh9> Baiken: the most POPULAR extra
[0:40:27] <%BisoromiBear> May is the key to all of this
[0:40:28] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr He hhelps Asuka, but I dont know
[0:40:32] <dds333a> If you said this about Jam, I'd understand, but LUL
[0:40:35] <%kyh9> "where's Baiken and Anji?" "Who?"
[0:40:37] <%Juriasu> NotLikeThis
[0:40:39] <DatAsuna> @Equirah kismet is awful and needs to go away
[0:40:40] <leith_aziz> Thats gotta hurt
[0:40:43] <%kyh9> LMAO
[0:40:46] <heartlesshealer> oof
[0:40:49] <servicesuspension> Second class plot citizens. Gaiden people
[0:40:50] <yomamma133713> Ouch
[0:40:52] <%kyh9> Overture is the REAL plot
[0:40:54] <leith_aziz> But yeah, Baiken will never really play a prt
[0:40:55] <Deko_> isnt tekken like that?
[0:41:02] <%Juriasu> atleast Ram is important :)
[0:41:04] <+Mrbaconator> sol has only been in one fighting game
[0:41:05] <leith_aziz> @Deko_ Yep. Mishima's only
[0:41:06] <+Mrbaconator> *sin
[0:41:08] <+Mrbaconator> not sol
[0:41:09] <diegobandzz> Sheesh
[0:41:13] <%JustYudha> LUL LUL LUL
[0:41:15] <leith_aziz> I would argue Tekken is even worse
[0:41:16] <%kyh9> I did!
[0:41:19] <%kyh9> That's why I asked!
[0:41:19] <Equirah> Here's to never seeing Nagu ever again LUL
[0:41:20] <andre11dr> And Raven, his Asukas assassin dude
[0:41:20] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[0:41:23] <leith_aziz> Not a Mishima? You dont matter
[0:41:30] <%kyh9> I barely hear ANYTHING about Slayer or Baiken or Anji in that
[0:41:33] <%kyh9> Which is funny
[0:41:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1394548130813779974
[0:41:39] <servicesuspension> C A N O N P A C H I N K O
[0:41:43] <dds333a> An entire subplot, and it's a good one
[0:41:51] <%kyh9> Chipp and Axl get a TINY bit
[0:41:51] <diegobandzz> Yea if you don’t have the devil gene fuck off
[0:41:52] <leith_aziz> I do like how the League of Assasin has more of a self containedd narrative
[0:41:54] <dds333a> Albeit still a subplot
[0:42:02] <heartlesshealer> god, the canon pachinko footage dive woolie had to do
[0:42:03] <leith_aziz> Axl gets some moments
[0:42:13] <servicesuspension> you didn't win!
[0:42:17] <Johannen> They need to bring that back YOOoo
[0:42:19] <+SignScratch> you didn't win
[0:42:19] <diegobandzz> Mk deception!!!!!!!!
[0:42:21] <andre11dr> In KOF it doesn't matter, random teams win sometimes
[0:42:23] <Kyuseishun> i dont feel its bad thing that your story has a selection of main characters and side ch to cover a range of tastes
[0:42:23] <Johannen> That is LIT
[0:42:25] <%krispen_wa> isnt Venom super important in Rev's story?
[0:42:25] <+Exicuren> Harakiris were the "you didn't win" command
[0:42:26] <dds333a> Yup, I'm gonna do it before you do it
[0:42:27] <Rojahh> you didnt win
[0:42:33] <diegobandzz> Man that game was BAD
[0:42:37] <leith_aziz> Because they dont interrupt the pace
[0:42:42] <diegobandzz> I loved it tho
[0:42:47] <yomamma133713> Brutalities are great
[0:42:58] <andre11dr> KOF is wierswierd because the main characters keep changing
[0:43:01] <leith_aziz> @krispen_wa: He stopped Bedman. That was about it
[0:43:15] <dds333a> @andre11dr although, most of the team the same teams tend to win. usually the protagonists, and the Ikari warriors won a tournament
[0:43:27] <Picia000123> I would prefer if brutalities would happen if you just did the move but held the button, otherwise it's so hard to get a brutality in some cases
[0:43:28] <diegobandzz> Hard kiri was the ultimate you didn’t win
[0:43:31] <dds333a> In fact, Benimaru canonically has the most tournament wins
[0:43:38] <diegobandzz> Hara*
[0:43:40] <servicesuspension> @andre11dr how about that Shun'ei tho
[0:43:46] <+Exicuren> Yes, hey had special conditions
[0:43:47] <clack14> BabyRage
[0:43:50] <%jinking79> a weapon lord kill combo
[0:43:56] <%krispen_wa> @leith_aziz i mean bedman was a pretty big antagonist
[0:43:57] <%SivSarcast> @diegobandzz "There was no W, there is only L"
[0:43:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:44:04] <andre11dr> I hate the 14 designs @servicesuspension
[0:44:04] <heartlesshealer> nice
[0:44:15] <Rojahh> nothing will ever beat  13-0 in a FT10 in MK
[0:44:16] <dds333a> Take a breather, man, you need it LUL
[0:44:18] <leith_aziz> @Kyuseishun : I think a focues cast is better in terms of giving you main cast enough screentime, but dont forget about the rest of your cast
[0:44:22] <DaKnightWarrior> MK9 <3
[0:44:29] <leith_aziz> *Focused
[0:44:29] <servicesuspension> @andre11dr that color palette is hell
[0:44:40] <+SignScratch> yo, in game call outs
[0:45:02] <andre11dr> Actually wait no ,i take that back, 14 had some cool new comers, but some where like Korean MMO NPC
[0:45:06] <Equirah> cause FGC sisn't toxic enough already LUL
[0:45:17] <leith_aziz> Guilty Gear kinda has that in Arcade mode, but yeah, we need more
[0:45:20] <+SignScratch> "You should block more on wakeup"
[0:45:26] <%illtima> Netherrealm is still the best at that stuff
[0:45:27] <kainsonofdeath> fighterz has that to some extent
[0:45:28] <dds333a> There are some fighting games with different win quotes depending on health at the end of the match
[0:45:31] <%jinking79> sf alpha gotta  win all fights for there true endings
[0:45:34] <newrotations> DISCO BAYBEEEEEEE
[0:45:36] <DSD24> There's the Pale
[0:45:36] <andre11dr> The black girl in 14 was cool, the fan design one, they should bring her back
[0:45:36] <newrotations> LETS GOOOO
[0:45:36] <Johannen> @Equirah You cant take Toxic away that is the genre of ultra competetive game
[0:45:37] <servicesuspension> Ahh Martinaise
[0:45:37] <Blank9> mentally prepared for butt stuff and blackface
[0:45:37] <leith_aziz> DBFZ's dramatic intros are cool. Its a shame they dropped them after launch
[0:45:38] <%SivSarcast> That main menu is so disco
[0:45:42] <DSD24> I love this main menu so much
[0:45:50] <servicesuspension> look at the airship
[0:45:51] <heartlesshealer> it's very good
[0:45:52] <servicesuspension> on the right
[0:45:53] <miucsa51> Time for CONTENT
[0:45:54] <sushahana> SourPls time to disco
[0:46:06] <Equirah> @Johannen hard disagree
[0:46:07] <%Juriasu> windows sounds PogChamp
[0:46:08] <DSD24> The best main menus give you details the more you play it
[0:46:09] <%johnny_gogo> damn got here as they started the game
[0:46:17] <andre11dr> This game really needs more disco in its soundtrack
[0:46:21] <%andrewofbob> I thought that was my laptop for a moment
[0:46:22] <DaKnightWarrior> dayxwoSip
[0:46:22] <DSD24> @johnny_gogo That's some good timing
[0:46:22] <servicesuspension> the fumes are porch collapse I guess
[0:46:23] <%JustYudha> you missed the preshow talk
[0:46:30] <newrotations> anodal music only
[0:46:35] <servicesuspension> disco is dead tho
[0:46:36] <%gatorafan> I did not expect to like this soundtrack as much as I do daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:46:43] <andre11dr> Like where's my synths and high hats
[0:46:49] <+invalid_robin> what day are yall on?

[1:30:07] <%hax_metatron> Salami Man is the real final boss
[1:30:09] <WakeUpThrow> Wait, it doesn't heal anymore?
[1:30:10] <vadnhi> Kim *Loves* his good salami...

[1:30:19] <Johannen> @Lion_kun He goes away on Day 3
[1:30:24] <%ppangboi> He's there if you come down here before day 3.
[1:30:30] <heemwizard> @Lion_kun yeah i missed it the first time
[1:30:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Johannen What triggers him to show in the original? He never appeared in the original everyime I played. I see him everytime now in the final cut
[1:30:33] <andre11dr> That's the first time your cop has eaten something i think LUL
[1:30:34] <%chandlerofearth> ghee?
[1:30:34] <$arcielardor> Woolie, you can visual calculus the pawn shop's roof
[1:30:37] <WakeUpThrow> It healed a pip of health on my playthrough!
[1:30:40] <%elhafnero> probabably
[1:30:41] <primaryfire> pat also never interacted with the billboard
[1:30:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wait Pat didn't find this guy? Could've sworn he did
[1:30:46] <bebopdedop281> @TheRealGreaterGamer Just be there on tuesday
[1:30:46] <heemwizard> oh boy
[1:30:49] <ingman112> @arcielardor Nah it’s the sign
[1:30:51] <bebopdedop281> I saw hime very playthrough
[1:30:55] <linSP> this is day 2
[1:30:56] <Johannen> @TheRealGreaterGamer Nothing he is there from the start, he just goes away on day 3 when the lock is repaird
[1:30:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @bebopdedop281 He s there on monday too....
[1:30:58] <%Juriasu> cowardice!
[1:31:04] <Picia000123> @TheRealGreaterGamer you need to get here around time Woolie got in the first or 2nd day, that's all I think
[1:31:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:31:10] <miucsa51> Coward
[1:31:27] <skagtheprinceofhell> Do we really want to mess with the heavy machinery?
[1:31:39] <DSD24> Looks like we gotta wait then
[1:31:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> billboard?
[1:31:45] <+MightyDuckShoes> GREEN
[1:31:45] <+Afrobrawler> are the thoughts bugged?
[1:31:47] <vadnhi> Fun Fact: If you keep hitting stuff you actually get a thought that makes you REALLY GOOD at hitting stuff. :P
[1:31:51] <primaryfire> you can interact with the billboard
[1:31:53] <pi_in_the_sci> can you look at the billboard?
[1:31:58] <SomeAsianDood> go back woolie. billboard was green
[1:32:04] <heemwizard> @Afrobrawler did he investigate the fence yet
[1:32:07] <+OblivionSword1> heal up why not
[1:32:12] <%kyh9> tons of free money in there
[1:32:13] <+OblivionSword1> you have plenty
[1:32:15] <+MightyDuckShoes> 40 centavos right there
[1:32:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Thats fair, I always had to many heals anyways
[1:32:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> The free heals ALWAYS come right after you heal manually
[1:32:22] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can always heal up during the check, for future knowledge
[1:32:28] <ainda_> its very hard to die tbh, no reason not to op off
[1:32:29] <%Lion_kun> NEVER SELL ANYTHING BUT POSTCARDS
[1:32:42] <%ppangboi> but you miss out on passive rolls if you are hurt which is I think Woolie's logic
[1:32:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Johannen He means passive checks
[1:32:42] <+gnosislord> Getting that salami was a free heal in the original
[1:32:44] <+Afrobrawler> not sure it just looked bugged cause i saw the thought ring but not the bubble
[1:33:03] <servicesuspension> this place feels real fallout
[1:33:16] <vavilonica> it's Guys
[1:33:19] <SomeAsianDood> @afrobrawler thought ring shows up with tab key even of no thoughts
[1:33:19] <WakeUpThrow> Strange, it healed me on Final Cut too. Maybe it was patched out recently?
[1:33:24] <TheRealGreaterGamer> HMMM

[1:40:39] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> endurance IS the facist
[1:40:41] <skagtheprinceofhell> because it's red?
[1:40:44] <%Sunriser41> your gut
[1:40:45] <$doomerskeletor13> Your physical stats are fashy
[1:40:45] <+CateHecate> fascism comes from the Id, i think is the point
[1:40:46] <yomamma133713> 55
[1:40:47] <newrotations> who run the world
[1:40:47] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> The thesis is that fascism is a gut feeling
[1:40:48] <heemwizard> no one takes fascism seriously
[1:40:48] <%kyh9> The FOREIGN LEFTIST LIBERAL FINANCIERS
[1:40:49] <primaryfire> fascism is all gut feelings?
[1:40:50] <ainda_> Fascists are all about the Body-Politic, the nation/race is abody
[1:40:51] <heemwizard> you need to endure
[1:40:52] <%johnny_gogo> i said more facist stuff then you but i never had this pop up
[1:40:52] <iacus_> i guess they associate fascism with physical prowess?
[1:40:53] <vavilonica> Fascism is all about taking damage
[1:40:53] <andre11dr> It's Endurance or Physical Instrument
[1:40:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Fascism is POWER
[1:40:54] <Lancaster_H> you against the world
[1:40:57] <SomeAsianDood> fascism is STRONG
[1:40:57] <+SignScratch> reactionaries
[1:41:00] <Blank9> gut feeling
[1:41:00] <+tigerfang86> Fascism is all about SURVIVAL OF THE STRONG
[1:41:00] <%nuttbrain> makes sense in a way
[1:41:01] <%Sunriser41> fascist comes from your gut
[1:41:02] <abelincoln_catpuncher> exactly
[1:41:03] <mr_sups> Gut reactionary feelings
[1:41:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> Authority is separate from left vs right
[1:41:08] <+tigerfang86> YOU MUST BE STRONG, ect.
[1:41:09] <heemwizard> ENDURE FOR REVACHOL
[1:41:10] <ingman112> What does your gut tell you? What’s the best way for you to cope with your dignity?
[1:41:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> STRENGTH and POWER basically
[1:41:11] <needforsleep8888> physique is all about manliness and survival of the fittest
[1:41:11] <+CateHecate> fascism comes from your Half-Light
[1:41:12] <newrotations> just built different
[1:41:13] <Zeemod155> "don't let the world kill you"
[1:41:13] <Blank9> authority is personal
[1:41:16] <servicesuspension> Authority is not nationalist. Authority obeys the MoralIntern
[1:41:18] <WakeUpThrow> Wouldn't that be Half-Light, though?
[1:41:19] <+pectusumbra> Heavy focus on Facism's persecution complex?
[1:41:19] <Yung_FckUp> fascism is stored in the gut
[1:41:20] <zanzibarian_hamster> The other is bad, it wants to hurt you, endurance wants to protect you from that
[1:41:21] <sushahana> authority is more cop like i think
[1:41:21] <+CateHecate> quite literally a reactionary
[1:41:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Communists are acutally quite authoritarian
[1:41:23] <+MightyDuckShoes> Reaction-ary
[1:41:24] <%andrewofbob> It's how well you can take the beatings in the gulags
[1:41:26] <andre11dr> So 5 won't advance it
[1:41:26] <%hologram_sam> that makes sense, Authority enables the use of force in the name of that feeling?
[1:41:27] <%nuttbrain> personally I have gut feelings of camaraderie and solidarity :)

[1:50:16] <LlewynMarie> I don't understand it. So It's bad.
[1:50:18] <linSP> facism the slippery slope
[1:50:29] <AMaidIndeed> @irridium Ho ho hoooo, heard that before
[1:50:31] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean, by that logic the average person is facist.
[1:50:33] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Guys Endurance is Strength and Power. The tenants of fascism
[1:50:39] <Robot_Nixon_> @mr_sups the realism is too much NotLikeThis
[1:50:46] <ingman112> @indigo_automaton Nah halflight’s too afraid of everything to commit to a political ideology. Wouldn’t fit anything but apocalypse cop
[1:50:48] <ToxInjection> Always a good day when we have a Disco stream VoHiYo
[1:50:52] <dukenux> half life is more like pure id, no try to justify things
[1:50:55] <andre11dr> Now you can go a little fascist and just be like " i don't like those people" or GO ALL IN
[1:50:59] <dukenux> *half light
[1:51:04] <notsoy> i mean yeah, your primitive lizard brain hates the "other", so there'a a tiny fascist in most of us
[1:51:05] <newrotations> half light is like, intense paranoia
[1:51:13] <skagtheprinceofhell> @TheRealGreaterGamer I mean, any government needs that or it has no control.
[1:51:17] <%nuttbrain> running a marathon and having paranoid thoughts about foreigners
[1:51:19] <heemwizard> fight or flgiht
[1:51:19] <+CateHecate> Half Light is being the unabomber
[1:51:20] <lyzejag> This fucking game
[1:51:24] <heemwizard> its about fear
[1:51:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Walls just want to destroy our traditional way of life
[1:51:33] <Robot_Nixon_> ow my hand. I blame the women 😡
[1:51:36] <$arcielardor> fascism comes from the ass
[1:51:36] <notsoy> it's just most of us are smart enough to not only listen to the lizard brain
[1:51:48] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @skagtheprinceofhell yeah but how many governments devote ceremonies to their leader lifting a gold baton above his chest? LUL
[1:51:49] <ingman112> @woolieversus It’s important to remember that every Skill has good and bad tendencies. Endurance can be super fascist, but it’s also designed to keep you alive
[1:51:49] <$doomerskeletor13> Yeah there was a radio earlier
[1:51:51] <ToxInjection> All the skills have their moments of "bro, chill tf out"
[1:51:58] <gunsrlove> Slowly inch your way to the Measurehead final form

[1:52:18] <heemwizard> you actually got to the chcck
[1:52:19] <yomamma133713> You literally just tried to buy speakers from the other guy
[1:52:24] <Indigo_Automaton> Hmmm
[1:52:26] <iacus_> they are related to the karaoke quest
[1:52:27] <skagtheprinceofhell> @TheRealGreaterGamer Most? What is the "golden baton" is different.
[1:52:28] <%nuttbrain> isn't endurance the health stat too lol
[1:52:33] <%andrewofbob> Get the "50 cents" speakers LUL
[1:52:37] <AMaidIndeed> That or you throw a rager

[1:53:31] <iacus_> @servicesuspension radio is transmited via the air, tape has to be pre-recorded
[1:53:35] <skagtheprinceofhell> "This ain't a scene, it's a GOD. DAMN. ARMS. RACE!"
[1:53:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @skagtheprinceofhell Are you seriously ready to argue about the definition of fascism and its core tenants in a twitch chat? LUL
[1:53:40] <heemwizard> ah designed in seol
[1:53:46] <SomeAsianDood> that's not how it works roy
[1:53:48] <TheRealGreaterGamer> because Im not LUL
[1:53:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> Also reading and writing from tape is super slow and the capacity isn't anything special either. Very stable long term tho

[2:25:15] <%purps26> they did a whoopsie

[2:26:19] <Zomner> @TheRealGreaterGamer BECAUSE IT WASN'T THERE
[2:26:20] <+Gamblitz> 3.6 Roentgens
[2:26:23] <%KineticZen> Chernobyl was human error though
[2:26:26] <servicesuspension> This is what we call a systematic failure. EVERYTHING went wrong

[2:26:38] <+Prevot> definitely
[2:26:42] <skagtheprinceofhell> I thought it was human error that cause machine error though?
[2:26:45] <Johannen> @KineticZen Not just human error
[2:27:04] <pi_in_the_sci> This was WORSE than Chernobyl, there was no organizing state left by the time this failed
[2:27:06] <ToxInjection> Come on guys, having a third arm is actually rad
[2:27:10] <andre11dr> Yeah man totally, fo the people
[2:27:11] <laguerrilha> The emergency shutdown systems were broken, it wasnt just human error

[2:28:18] <+CateHecate> like 8
[2:28:18] <+Gamblitz> Biorobots
[2:28:18] <dukenux> and the test was hastily prepared because of some delays earlier
[2:28:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> Not many
[2:28:20] <dauver> 8
[2:28:20] <ainda_> 8
[2:28:21] <%kyh9> 8?
[2:28:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Like less than 10?
[2:28:22] <aewheros> Got an idea. How about we replace Chernobyl with a new nuclear plant?
[2:28:23] <+TheKekromancer> 8
[2:28:23] <+mads_valentine> 6 - 9 iirc
[2:28:23] <SomeAsianDood> 8
[2:28:24] <mariothemaio> barely
[2:28:25] <%BisoromiBear> too many
[2:28:25] <deviljhojho_> dunno lol
[2:28:25] <mr_sups> Like 8?
[2:28:26] <skagtheprinceofhell> Moralist?
[2:28:26] <servicesuspension> The commune lasted 8 years
[2:28:29] <ainda_> the reactor failed *after* the commune fell
[2:28:33] <$hattrick61> 9 days
[2:28:36] <dauver> pile meltdown was after the commune fell
[2:28:36] <andre11dr> Like 8 or 9
[2:28:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> too many
[2:28:39] <ToxInjection> Reminds me of the elderly Japanese folks volunteering to clean up that one reactor thing.
[2:28:41] <$doomerskeletor13> This happened during the MoralIntern
[2:28:46] <ingman112> This happened after the revolution
[2:28:49] <Blackleafx> The UN didnt "step in", the UN invaded
[2:28:50] <TheRealGreaterGamer> "Too many." LUL
[2:28:56] <Iandrasil> the people's pile happened after the fall of the commune it happened under the moralintern
[2:28:57] <$hattrick61> oh real life?
[2:29:01] <yomamma133713> The UN invaded
[2:29:03] <aewheros> The *people* did
[2:29:04] <TheRealGreaterGamer> yeah it wasnt all the commies fault
[2:29:04] <BernieSandworm> I mean, it fucked up BECAUSE the UN stepped in
[2:29:07] <Johannen> Yeah they tried to get energy cause place was a shithole after the WAR
[2:29:07] <+babyacid> CAPITAL...stepped in
[2:29:13] <dukenux> @aewheros the other rractir blocks in Chernobyl actually kept working after the disaster. they were still used
[2:29:15] <Blackleafx> It is
[2:29:15] <andre11dr> Actually the people started revolting and then the UN came in
[2:29:16] <%ppangboi> always interesting to see chat's politics in real time during disco streams :)
[2:29:19] <deviljhojho_> Are moralists just centrists?
[2:29:20] <pyshcocanuck> It does
[2:29:20] <$doomerskeletor13> It is yeah
[2:29:21] <laguerrilha> it is
[2:29:21] <dukenux> *reactor
[2:29:23] <primaryfire> essentially yes
[2:29:23] <SomeAsianDood> it does
[2:29:25] <servicesuspension> The communists started but people continued under the coalition
[2:29:25] <+OblivionSword1> Moralist intern is basically the UN
[2:29:26] <Blackleafx> But those guys were an invading army
[2:29:28] <ainda_> It is, they took control by bombing the entire county to shit
[2:29:37] <%nuttbrain> eu un type
[2:29:39] <deviljhojho_> that doesnt sound very moral
[2:29:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Moralintern is the UN, and moralists are centrists, and make up the Moralintern
[2:29:42] <%purps26> The Coalition is the fake UN. Moralism is their ideology
[2:29:44] <+Gamblitz> North Korean Reactor
[2:29:49] <morow1ec> Moralism is the ideology, Moralintern is the organization
[2:29:59] <pi_in_the_sci> moralists are conservative incrementalists, the people who's answer to everything is "slow down"
[2:30:00] <%nuttbrain> I took it more as the EU
[2:30:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wait you can't contain radioactive decay with the hopes and dreams of the proletariat?
[2:30:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus There was a monarchy. People revolted for communism. Moralist came and squashed it. I think.
[2:30:15] <SomeAsianDood> u know what. That's fair
[2:30:16] <deviljhojho_> not with that attitude
[2:30:18] <+CateHecate> revachol is also *huge*
[2:30:18] <aewheros> The coalition is rather Nato allied with Russia
[2:30:20] <%krispen_wa> moralism is stagnancy. stagnancy is apathy. apathy is death
[2:30:33] <servicesuspension> This guy's life was awful
[2:30:33] <+walternatorz> Montreal had a pile meltdown?
[2:30:41] <dukenux> i like to think of Moralintern as G7
[2:30:46] <+CateHecate> like Revachol seems bigger than New York, where like, different areas are cities in their own right
[2:30:47] <+OblivionSword1> give it to cuno
[2:30:49] <DSD24> Don't do drugs
[2:30:52] <iacus_> this is a no-drug playthrough
[2:30:52] <ToxInjection> we can take ONE (1) DRUG
[2:30:57] <mariothemaio> The Moralintern is the large body of power that runs the Coalition. The coalition is the arm of the moralists essentially
[2:30:57] <heemwizard> do drugs
[2:30:59] <+Bitscreed> Do them drugs.
[2:31:00] <+babyacid> think if the UN decided to just murder communism before it became popular
[2:31:02] <vavilonica> NO Do ALL the drugs
[2:31:03] <andre11dr> You can do 1
[2:31:03] <heemwizard> just avoid alcohol
[2:31:09] <dukenux> or yeah NATO, but wider
[2:31:11] <vadnhi> Some are Good. Some are Bad... Ask your Mom and ask your Dad...
[2:31:24] <TheRealGreaterGamer> No drug playthrough is fine and preferable if you are invested in Kim not thinking less of you LUL
[2:31:28] <+KillerCrocomire> Alchol is like your worst thing
[2:31:31] <dauver> stay clean for Kim BibleThump
[2:31:32] <andre11dr> It's just psychedelics, it won't harm you ,probably
[2:31:38] <andre11dr> It depends
[2:31:38] <+Gamblitz> I ride Pyro too: mudduh muddah muddah

[2:32:48] <Equirah> Sell it on the corner LUL
[2:32:50] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Fact: drugs
[2:32:54] <tomo_vendor> those effects are temporary though
[2:32:57] <+OblivionSword1> Drugs increase your level cap
[2:32:59] <servicesuspension> +2 PSY is a gigantic bonus tho
[2:33:00] <+DaSkeeters> Your giving into temptation
[2:33:01] <flyingmulita> drugs are really useful tho
[2:33:02] <+SealOfKoalaTea> drugsare your friends.

[2:33:34] <Gawayne2> Emergency drugs
[2:33:36] <ToxInjection> ready to critique your shitty art
[2:33:38] <andre11dr> I guess it's medical LSD
[2:33:38] <+Javaa01> @tomo_vendor With this loadout, yes, but with another set of thoughts and a drug positive attitude, nope
[2:33:39] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Drugs are actually very useful in this game that way its actually hard to avoid taking them
[2:33:45] <%andrewofbob> 3 is "eh"
[2:33:58] <Gawayne2> Tomorrow's Day 3, right?
[2:33:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Because addiction sucks
[2:33:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so this drug gives you more willpower, imagination, empathy, authority, suggestion, and cop bond?
[2:34:08] <servicesuspension> Yeah, but only for a while
[2:34:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> damn that's some good stuff
[2:34:12] <+Javaa01> You can absolutely turn the temporary buffs of drugs into permanent power, at the cost of addiction
[2:34:13] <+Count_Viscount> dice? i missed the dice? damn
[2:34:23] <SomeAsianDood> the fact that DRUGS are useful got the game banned in Australia for a while. fun fact!

[2:35:16] <yomamma133713> GOAT cheese
[2:35:18] <+SealOfKoalaTea> actually good goat cheese is pretty great. I fear whatever woolie is talking about now
[2:35:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's good because it doesn't have lactose in it
[2:35:19] <%andrewofbob> So, max your purple skills, stock up on 24 skill points, neck the drubs, whack those skills up, go crazy
[2:35:19] <Deasmeister> The texture is a bit naff

[2:35:24] <vavilonica> Mysterious Grenadian Cheese
[2:35:26] <LlewynMarie> oh
[2:35:27] <+Reverend_Roscoe> it's from Grenada, it's not real cheese

[2:35:40] <defaultname3887> grenedian goat cheese
[2:35:41] <+ALazo> betrayed by cheese

[2:35:42] <ToxInjection> like straight up MRE ration shit?
[2:35:45] <+CateHecate> goat head soup sounds fucking delicious
[2:35:46] <+SealOfKoalaTea> woolie is clearly suffering LUL
[2:35:47] <%jepupu> Goat and goat by-products
[2:35:53] <SomeAsianDood> @skagtheprinceofhell yup the board cited the lack of downside and the explicit mention of amphetamines=speed. fallout had to change the name of morphine to medipaks to avoid ban.
[2:35:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> Goat's Head Soup is a great Rolling Stones album though
[2:35:53] <AMaidIndeed> curried goat?
[2:35:54] <%gatorafan> daedra1DerpyTibs

[2:36:47] <DatAsuna> paneer curry

[2:39:47] <iacus_> the notation is wrong

[2:53:38] <ainda_> Its about you
[2:53:42] <Gawayne2> Heartbreak
[2:53:44] <ainda_> you are looking at you
[2:53:48] <tomo_vendor> its about mourning
[2:53:49] <+MrAtheGreat> it is. It was when you read the letter
[2:53:50] <+OblivionSword1> it's when you read the letter in the ledger
[2:53:55] <primaryfire> the earlier you get art cop, the better
[2:54:05] <%chandlerofearth> Visual calculus for the footprint check tho
[2:54:06] <yomamma133713> Art cop best cop
[2:54:10] <pi_in_the_sci> "White Mourning" refers to a deep loss that is like a death, but not a death
[2:54:15] <triangularblasphemy> Art cop is quite good
[2:54:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Art Cop is great, you will want it asap
[2:54:19] <WakeUpThrow> It's REALLY GOOD

[2:55:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:55:31] <SomeAsianDood> they're all gags
[2:55:33] <servicesuspension> they give bonuses and shit too
[2:55:34] <diegobandzz> Why not???
[2:55:37] <die_hardman> ART DEGREE
[2:55:38] <+SealOfKoalaTea> @WoolieVersus almost all are gags, buuut art cop is amazing, get it.
[2:55:41] <+OblivionSword1> do what you want Woolie
[2:55:42] <triangularblasphemy> The game will almost always mock you
[2:55:44] <LunarRemix> You will get spare points later on
[2:55:44] <nelsonsaysbooya> I hope Woolie makes his choises without even looking at us
[2:55:49] <+bassoontyphoon> Art cop is pretty strong
[2:55:52] <+FlubbedPig> Alternatively, Mazovian, Indirect and Nationhood are your political alignments
[2:55:54] <andre11dr> Also i can't wait for Aces High, they probably won't get it but i hope
[2:55:59] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Art cop gives you a fuck ton of EXP
[2:56:01] <%gatorafan> @nelsonsaysbooya too late, it seems
[2:56:05] <ingman112> @andre11dr They already can’t
[2:56:06] <servicesuspension> there's so much exp in the game, internalize away
[2:56:06] <Blackleafx> @andre11dr already missed it
[2:56:14] <heemwizard> @andre11dr they missed the shot
[2:56:14] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You will be constantly swapping out your worst thought for new thoughts until the end of the game.
[2:56:16] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Ignoring benefits and stuff, thought cabinet is who your character is choosing to be. Pick what you want in your heart.
[2:56:17] <andre11dr> Ah that's right
[2:56:19] <ToxInjection> I mean, they all come with some type of benefit
[2:56:20] <andre11dr> Damn
[2:56:24] <heemwizard> also aces low is better
[2:56:27] <heemwizard> hah
[2:57:06] <heemwizard> 222
[2:57:16] <Qpic> h o n o r  c o p
[2:57:18] <ToxInjection> You already chose the path of the HONOURLESS
[2:57:19] <+MrAtheGreat> Meh, you already lost your chance at honor
[2:57:21] <EviiPaladin> oh NOW woolie cares about honour
[2:57:23] <heemwizard> too bad he missed that
[2:57:27] <Zomner> ah yes, Honor
[2:57:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Lmao, you were 2 feet away when you learned about that
[2:57:32] <%gatorafan> FAKE HONOR Kappa
[2:57:32] <ToxInjection> You DENIED yourself the Rite of Honour
[2:57:37] <Blackleafx> talk to the drinking boiss
[2:57:41] <Blackleafx> aw
[2:57:48] <+FlubbedPig> I think you can tell Lena about the Waterlock
[2:57:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he still hasn't talked to the hardies right?
[2:57:59] <heemwizard> no
[2:57:59] <+MrAtheGreat> honor poser
[2:58:03] <+IvesNapalm> nope
[2:58:04] <Blackleafx> nop
[2:58:05] <Johannen> no talk jutsu
[2:58:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> @cobalt_phoenix_ Just the lawyer
[2:58:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok
[2:58:08] <heemwizard> get the body and footprints first
[2:58:08] <Blackleafx> Ah thatm akse sense
[2:58:11] <Blackleafx> Gotcha woolie
[2:58:13] <+MightyDuckShoes> Maybe add a bright orange asterisk next to those.
[2:58:16] <primaryfire> just gotta think if an npc might know about somethingf you've investigated
[2:58:16] <+OblivionSword1> yeah those boys are immprtant
[2:58:24] <servicesuspension> there's also more stuff near the greenhouse}

[2:58:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Thats why you constantly retalk to every minor character ever and take 500 hours to beat the game like a normal person LUL
[2:58:28] <Blank9> there's still measurehead too
[2:58:35] <Louie_Salmon> You could always turn on the twitch integration for a little stat boost
[2:58:48] <%krispen_wa> THE FUCK DOES CUNO CARE
[2:58:50] <Blackleafx> LUL
[2:58:52] <Zomner> 👀
[2:58:53] <$doomerskeletor13> Give child drugs
[2:58:53] <tomo_vendor> @Louie_Salmon I feel like he'd never do it because it would upset the anime only boys
[2:58:54] <+MrAtheGreat> drugs!
[2:58:56] <heemwizard> take the speed for yourself
[2:58:57] <%thetunnelhomer> Ooh, take the drugs if you fail the test
[2:58:58] <%krispen_wa> YEYEYEYE
[2:59:00] <+Exicuren> Ahhhh, good move
[2:59:02] <+vaderxyz1970> Speed
[2:59:06] <andre11dr> DON'T FUCK ON THE CUNO
[2:59:07] <flyingmulita> do drugs to understand Cuno good plan
[2:59:08] <+OblivionSword1> Chat Woolie will never ever use the Twitcht integration
[2:59:10] <yomamma133713> @louie_salmon that's cheating tho screw that
[2:59:11] <+SignScratch> the footprints
[2:59:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's always the option to learn about the Race Enigma from Measurehead
[2:59:16] <$doomerskeletor13> CUNO DOESNT FUC-
[2:59:18] <Johannen> Woolie got to get High'er
[2:59:19] <WakeUpThrow> He already tried to kill one once, what's some drug pushing, eh?
[2:59:19] <dukenux> get "higher"
[2:59:21] <+MrAtheGreat> map
[2:59:27] <Blackleafx> @OblivionSword1 he said he'd try it once, probably
[2:59:29] <EviiPaladin> here's the plot: things bad
[2:59:32] <vadnhi> "kim. Gimme a sec. I gotta split a Kilo with this preteen kid..."
[2:59:36] <SolidScorpion> give the child drugs then arrest him for possesion
[2:59:36] <Blank9> plot would level you for checks
[2:59:38] <heemwizard> @ReallyBigRocks or tell him to do something else
[2:59:40] <Louie_Salmon> @yomamma133713 Cheating is cool, cheaters are big winners
[2:59:41] <+MrAtheGreat> yeaH
[2:59:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> newly added i think
[2:59:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> It means new
[2:59:50] <+OblivionSword1> @OblivionSword1 after how many sessions now it's very unlikely
[2:59:52] <servicesuspension> the backyard has more stuff to check around the corpse
[2:59:57] <+SignScratch> could buy a book I guess
[3:00:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @OblivionSword1 To be fair they are barely 1/10 through the game
[3:00:14] <%hax_metatron> Don't worry about it too much
[3:00:15] <ingman112> The harbor’s probably your next best bet: to help with Joyce’s task, and to get the body down
[3:00:17] <%hax_metatron> Just go with the flow
[3:00:21] <LeotheHuntsman> have they still not talked to measure head?
[3:00:26] <%hax_metatron> Remember the important things: Body, Union, etc.
[3:00:27] <+MightyDuckShoes> Took me my fifth run through to find out the more...altitude based entry into the harbor.
[3:00:30] <ingman112> @leothehuntsman they have once
[3:00:31] <+MrAtheGreat> some don't disappear. you did the door already @WoolieVersus
[3:00:36] <teefpal> wait, whats the egg on the map?
[3:00:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it can get overwhelming
[3:00:42] <teefpal> And that cube
[3:00:53] <vadnhi> @teefpal That;'s where Northernlion is hanging out.
[3:00:53] <+MrAtheGreat> Skill tracker is hard unfinished
[3:01:00] <heemwizard> until day 3
[3:01:03] <LunarRemix> It opens up on the 3rd day
[3:01:04] <SomeAsianDood> @teefpal planned tourist attractions
[3:01:07] <servicesuspension> some of these things were never built
[3:01:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> The game keeps it "simple" for the first two days
[3:01:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> For now all you really have left is the harbor
[3:01:11] <Johannen> @MightyDuckShoes Is that the one that invloves some cool jumps?
[3:01:11] <+OblivionSword1> Some of you underestimate how stubborn Woolie can get on some things
[3:01:13] <SomeAsianDood> they didn't work out
[3:01:16] <teefpal> Evart
[3:01:17] <andre11dr> Also Physical Instrument is necessary if you want to fuck up Measure Head
[3:01:20] <Blackleafx> evrart
[3:01:20] <teefpal> The first boss
[3:01:22] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus You actually missed something else down there by the billboard iirc
[3:01:29] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Behind Measurehead
[3:01:30] <heemwizard> go through measurehead
[3:01:33] <+FlubbedPig> Claire is past Measurehead
[3:01:35] <yomamma133713> Measurehead
[3:01:36] <%Irridium> behind the CEO of racism
[3:01:36] <Blackleafx> fight the blackman
[3:01:36] <heemwizard> or jump...
[3:01:40] <+CateHecate> beat his ass
[3:01:42] <+MrAtheGreat> Fuck up the racists fuck
[3:01:42] <Johannen> @MrAtheGreat What did he missed?
[3:01:44] <dukenux> Mr. Evrart. He helps you find your gun
[3:01:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> how DO you deal with measurehead
[3:01:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> You must know thy enemy
[3:01:47] <%ppangboi> this might be the longest I've seen people go w/o talking to the Hardie Boys
[3:01:47] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus PASS THAT CONCEPTUALIZATION CHECK FOR CONTENT LUL
[3:01:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> with extreme violence
[3:01:48] <vadnhi> Did you internalize his Race Theory?
[3:01:50] <heemwizard> though with his stats, he def fail the jump
[3:01:53] <Blackleafx> NotLikeThis
[3:01:54] <ainda_> No
[3:01:54] <%chandlerofearth> drink beer to punch him
[3:01:56] <+MrAtheGreat> @Johannen The control panel
[3:01:56] <primaryfire> don't think you did
[3:01:58] <Blackleafx> psa1guy
[3:02:00] <teefpal> Evart helps you find your gun?
[3:02:01] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Just the breaker
[3:02:05] <yomamma133713> Become Racism
[3:02:06] <%hax_metatron> @MrAtheGreat He got it
[3:02:07] <SomeAsianDood> @mrathegreat he pulled it
[3:02:08] <Johannen> Woolie already did the control panel
[3:02:16] <%alpharius88> you migth want to explore the scene of the crime

[3:03:23] <servicesuspension> no, there's stuff near the greenhouse
[3:03:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> Can you retry the check on the footprints?
[3:03:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> we all become one guy at some point it happens
[3:03:27] <+MrAtheGreat> I don't think you check ed
[3:03:27] <heemwizard> footprints
[3:03:30] <+MrAtheGreat> checked it
[3:03:30] <yomamma133713> @frickenmoron he already looked at it
[3:03:31] <andre11dr> There's more
[3:03:33] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus The one time Woolie checks backseating it was a misspeak lol
[3:03:35] <tomo_vendor> @frickenmoron he just went over that like 30min ago
[3:03:37] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> do some wall hugging
[3:03:37] <Blackleafx> woooo
[3:03:38] <+OblivionSword1> gonna need help to get the corpse down
[3:03:41] <ingman112> @mrathegreat Perception’s not high enough. Leave it alone
[3:03:45] <linSP> I know there’s at least 3 ways to beat buff racist, the one woolie didn’t see is for a high motorics route
[3:03:45] <Blackleafx> aight now fail it :)
[3:03:57] <+MrAtheGreat> @hax_metatron Nice to meet you One Guy Brother
[3:04:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL
[3:04:01] <Blank9> you should really try white checks instead of leaving them
[3:04:02] <ingman112> Ah thought you meant something else. Jk
[3:04:04] <genmypoweralready> Woolie please stop refusing to do white checks
[3:04:07] <Blackleafx> Try white checks
[3:04:08] <+OblivionSword1> it's white so might as well try
[3:04:10] <mariothemaio> come back later, you have -1 for art degree right now
[3:04:11] <%Irridium> got any clothes that boost it?
[3:04:11] <heemwizard> its on top
[3:04:14] <+MrAtheGreat> might as well try
[3:04:14] <+DaSkeeters> Pog
[3:04:17] <Blackleafx> There's literally no penalty to it
[3:04:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's up, perspective is weird
[3:04:19] <ezera123> turn of art cop and then try
[3:04:24] <andre11dr> Put things on that give you perception
[3:04:25] <+Bitscreed> Give it a go. It's a white check so you've nothing to lose
[3:04:29] <+RoByte2> They're above you
[3:04:30] <+MrAtheGreat> Failed White check could lead to better white checks later
[3:04:33] <%purps26> that's the roof
[3:04:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @genmypoweralready He has attempted plenty and there good reasons for not always attempting
[3:04:38] <Blackleafx> NotLikeThis
[3:04:41] <%andrewofbob> The stuff is behind the white check
[3:04:41] <+OblivionSword1> can't go up there yet
[3:04:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea it looks weird
[3:04:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah perspective is a little weird there
[3:04:46] <yomamma133713> That's the roog
[3:04:47] <ingman112> You might wanna wait til after your thought’s internalized, when you don’t have a perception debuff
[3:04:49] <yomamma133713> Roof*
[3:04:49] <die_hardman> It’s in the roof
[3:04:54] <+MrAtheGreat> yeah that got me too
[3:05:01] <Blackleafx> :)
[3:05:06] <Blank9> in order to do anything you need to TRY
[3:05:10] <%thetunnelhomer> Double 6s can happen
[3:05:12] <genmypoweralready> @TheRealGreaterGamer You can usually suss out when failing a white check will screw you over. This one and others are pretty innocuous
[3:05:13] <+DaSkeeters> That’s a second floor
[3:05:14] <%purps26> it's a white check. you could give it a try and hope for luck
[3:05:15] <Zomner> do or do not, there is no try
[3:05:15] <heemwizard> hmm
[3:05:16] <+MrAtheGreat> #doitanyway
[3:05:16] <DoctorAvens> why not just try the check instead of leaving it alone?
[3:05:22] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Doesn't hurt to try!
[3:05:24] <Lancaster_H> there is literally zero reason to not try white checks
[3:05:25] <+invida> No downside to trying the check
[3:05:28] <heemwizard> what happened to the footprints
[3:05:29] <%andrewofbob> Woolie is becoming afraid of failure
[3:05:30] <ingman112> Nah wait til the thought’s done
[3:05:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> Huh, perception must be too low
[3:05:37] <servicesuspension> try the check because after the thought internalizes it will unlock anyway
[3:05:38] <yomamma133713> Try it once art cop is finished
[3:05:38] <Johannen> Unless you can boost those checks later
[3:05:41] <+IvesNapalm> Shuffle gear to get skills up, try the check
[3:05:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @genmypoweralready yeah but he cant possibly know whether a whit check's chances can be improved
[3:05:45] <Blackleafx> CLOSE
[3:05:51] <Blackleafx> :)
[3:05:52] <andre11dr> Nope
[3:05:55] <+MrAtheGreat> JUST DO IT !
[3:05:55] <Zomner> PogChamp
[3:05:56] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> So close though NotLikeThis
[3:05:58] <yomamma133713> Clothing
[3:05:58] <genmypoweralready> WELL LOOK AT THAT
[3:06:00] <Blackleafx> You sated your psaGoblin
[3:06:03] <sushahana> neurons activated
[3:06:05] <+DaSkeeters> Take off debuffs
[3:06:07] <+akajaybay> not sure if you can just change some gear to get one more perception and try it again immediately
[3:06:10] <+MrAtheGreat> SMALL ONES
[3:06:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> inland you fuck help us out
[3:06:18] <%krispen_wa> @akajaybay you cant
[3:06:20] <vadnhi> Think the check gets easier with repeated attempts, tho.
[3:06:23] <+MrAtheGreat> *HIntt hint*
[3:06:24] <primaryfire> sometimes it helps to wait
[3:06:26] <SomeAsianDood> @akajaybay gear switching doesn't reopen check
[3:06:26] <tomo_vendor> @akajaybay you cannot
[3:06:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Changing gear doesn't re-unlock checks I think
[3:06:31] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Red failures are WAY more likely to hurt you
[3:06:36] <primaryfire> @ReallyBigRocks correct
[3:06:41] <Blank9> there's no reason not, if you increase your stats then it'll reopen the check if you failed on white
[3:06:45] <SomeAsianDood> only stat increases
[3:06:49] <Gawayne2> Remember to save, Woolie
[3:06:49] <+IvesNapalm> It doesn't unlock, but if you have the chance to take a white stack those clothing skills up
[3:06:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> only time you shouldn't do a white check is if you can't upgrade the stat anymore, unless you're gonna savescum or use drugs
[3:06:51] <%krispen_wa> RIGHT TO WORK
[3:06:52] <%andrewofbob> Many red checks don't reappear if skipped
[3:06:54] <heemwizard> KO measurehead
[3:06:56] <+SignScratch> agent provocateur
[3:07:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Pass his conceptual check  PLEASE GOD LUL

[3:07:08] <Johannen> @Blank9 If you have a debuff or can put on some clothes later to increase the chances you could wait
[3:07:11] <teefpal> The more you fail White Checks, the higher the chance is to win
[3:07:12] <Zomner> hello again Measurehead

[3:20:12] <+MightyDuckShoes> Racists refuse to speak in the common parlance... Broootur...
[3:20:12] <teefpal> semenese = black?
[3:20:15] <mariothemaio> @SealOfKoalaTea true centrism
[3:20:16] <+FlubbedPig> He's GENETICALLY Semene
[3:20:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @skagtheprinceofhell
[3:20:18] <iacus_> areopagites sounds like egyptians
[3:20:19] <servicesuspension> in all levels except physical, he's semenese
[3:20:21] <skagtheprinceofhell> Sorry
[3:20:34] <+SealOfKoalaTea> I think if Woolie keeps studying his racism under his new Sensi MeasureHead, he can finally surpass Wakka, the legendary Super Racist.
[3:20:36] <ToxInjection> God, the accent.
[3:20:41] <Blank9> I mean, he can still be semenese without being born there.
[3:20:44] <SolidScorpion> he speaks the language correctly it is the kids who are wrong
[3:20:49] <zhukis> Wait, he's a Semenese poser?
[3:20:50] <servicesuspension> they are beeeautiful
[3:20:54] <%krispen_wa> Insulinde was empty before the moralists found it
[3:20:55] <heemwizard> sounds like horn africans

[3:21:02] <+SealOfKoalaTea> He's a huge fucking poser LUL
[3:21:06] <heemwizard> @Johannen no they live in desert
[3:21:07] <dukenux> @blank9 not by his own standards
[3:21:16] <DSD24> I love Pangea
[3:21:16] <Louie_Salmon> Sounds like it
[3:21:18] <Iwashi94> wait is "lactose intolerant" supposed to be their version of soyboy??
[3:21:23] <gunsrlove> But white people are the least lactose intolerant, what is this reverse world
[3:21:24] <+SealOfKoalaTea> maybe
[3:21:25] <+MrAtheGreat> That makes sense imo
[3:21:26] <Gawayne2> So he's jerking them off while also saying Semenese are an improvement?
[3:21:33] <+SealOfKoalaTea> that actually makes sense Iwashi
[3:21:33] <skagtheprinceofhell> What were the two landmasses called after pangea?
[3:21:37] <muXPerience> so the areopagites got on boats and settled in islands, becoming semenese (in this guy's racial theory)
[3:21:42] <+SignScratch> this is race theory, it's all about jumping to conclusions
[3:21:43] <EviiPaladin> erf
[3:21:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> Maybe before the Pale split the world? Still islands but without literal void inbetween
[3:21:52] <+SealOfKoalaTea> its also very goofy racist/genetic thing to get hung up on
[3:21:53] <+CateHecate> @skagtheprinceofhell i know one of them was Gondwanaland
[3:21:57] <+SealOfKoalaTea> so instant comedy

[3:30:49] <+RoByte2> You're probably seeing text bubbles from the scabs below
[3:30:56] <heemwizard> get moralist to 4
[3:30:58] <+SealOfKoalaTea> COMMUNIST WOOLIE LUL LUL
[3:31:01] <xeros720> wow, ultra communist
[3:31:03] <%BisoromiBear> Build it
[3:31:05] <TheRealGreaterGamer> 333 for moralist
[3:31:06] <%andrewofbob> The flickering is there, like 1.8Hz
[3:31:07] <heemwizard> 3333
[3:31:09] <pnukenonuke> commies are boring
[3:31:09] <%thetunnelhomer> 333
[3:31:17] <servicesuspension> take some points into everything
[3:31:19] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Woolie is the Commie Racist Artist LUL LUL
[3:31:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Actually no its boring
[3:31:22] <heemwizard> moralist
[3:31:24] <triangularblasphemy> @EviiPaladin Stonehenge is one thing, AND it is just some standing stones with cool solstice effects. Egypt got tons of gigamassive pyramids
[3:31:24] <heemwizard> both
[3:31:24] <genmypoweralready> Moralist
[3:31:24] <ingman112> 3
[3:31:29] <yomamma133713> Boring to 4
[3:31:29] <Blank9> just pick what you want to hear stop gaming it
[3:31:29] <WakeUpThrow> I think that's moralist
[3:31:29] <chu_chu_wa> same thing LUL
[3:31:30] <mariothemaio> the answer is 'yes'
[3:31:31] <+OblivionSword1> what's the difference really
[3:31:32] <skagtheprinceofhell> @EviiPaladin Looked another way, "Even with advance help they failed".
[3:31:32] <+MrAtheGreat> moralist is boring cop iirc
[3:31:34] <aewheros> For a moment there was hope
[3:31:34] <ingman112> Moralist
[3:31:35] <%bread_assassin> Boring and moralist are pretty much interchangable.
[3:31:36] <vadnhi> Keep pumping it and you may eventually build as much as *0.000004%" of Communism, someday, Woolie! :D
[3:31:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's tough cuz Moralists ARE boring
[3:31:40] <ainda_> dude just pick what you want stop counting lol
[3:31:41] <andre11dr> They should be the same thing LUL
[3:31:43] <pnukenonuke> moralist is dodging politics, boring cop is dodging fun which is sometimes politics
[3:31:45] <linSP> moralist is the boring ideology
[3:31:46] <iacus_> moralist is the politica, boring cop is just the non-wacko, reasonable answers
[3:31:47] <+FlubbedPig> Boring Cop is specifically being a regular professional cop, I think
[3:31:49] <ingman112> Moralist is political, boring cop is how you conduct yourself
[3:31:51] <servicesuspension> moralist is "everyone is right but wrong". Boring cop is "I don't care"
[3:31:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Moralist isnt Apolitical its just incrementally neutral i think
[3:31:53] <+DaSkeeters> Denver your “faking” your racism

[3:32:10] <EviiPaladin> @skagtheprinceofhell dude, that's so much funnier. stonehenge is an attempted pyramid is sending me.

[3:36:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> So measurehead is against racemixing, but he still has those women around?
[3:36:54] <WakeUpThrow> So pretty much "nuh uh"
[3:36:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> what a horrible thought
[3:36:57] <servicesuspension> a good rule of thumb is that you should assume everything is like reality unless pointed otherwise
[3:36:58] <triangularblasphemy> Was that a fucking PARRY???
[3:37:00] <twohitgood> you can generally trust in measurehead being wrong.

[3:37:44] <+MightyDuckShoes> @skagtheprinceofhell It was a progressive but of its time work that should be kept in context to it's place in time... or it's a perfectly adequate depiction of a mixed race knight.
[3:37:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> @heemwizard Yeah but still, with someone as hard in the paint as measurehead I doubt he'd even risk it

[3:51:14] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah you get in by sitting down and shutting up LUL

[3:51:24] <skagtheprinceofhell> Fuck that.
[3:51:27] <primaryfire> INCREMENTAL PROGRESS
[3:51:28] <+SealOfKoalaTea> just one day
[3:51:28] <+Bitscreed> Shhh, just be quiet and let things happen.
[3:51:31] <restingbones> How can you be both this AND communist?
[3:51:37] <+SealOfKoalaTea> eventually, if we are miserable long enough, we can be happy
[3:51:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:51:43] <%kyh9> This is the ONLY political thought with no negatives
[3:51:45] <+SealOfKoalaTea> !motivated
[3:51:46] <@Moobot> @SealOfKoalaTea 2227 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:51:49] <deviljhojho_> you can be a bunch of ideologies at once
[3:51:50] <skagtheprinceofhell> @dds333a But wouldn't they be the psyker equivalent in this analogy?
[3:51:50] <$doomerskeletor13> One day things will get better. Don’t worry about it now
[3:51:59] <Ids560> the negative is moralism sucks
[3:51:59] <+MrAtheGreat> I can't wait until Woolie meets... HIM
[3:52:13] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Moralism is... THE BLAND
[3:52:14] <heemwizard> research this thought
[3:52:14] <%hax_metatron> NOOOO
[3:52:16] <%hax_metatron> IMPOSSIBLE
[3:52:16] <heemwizard> no
[3:52:17] <elshadow7> Nope
[3:52:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can't
[3:52:18] <Ids560> you cannot
[3:52:18] <primaryfire> can't
[3:52:18] <%DiscoMatador> NO
[3:52:18] <%kyh9> NO
[3:52:18] <+SealOfKoalaTea> you can't
[3:52:19] <Zomner> @MrAtheGreat ah yes, FRIEND
[3:52:19] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus It's impossible
[3:52:19] <+SignScratch> no
[3:52:20] <chrisarithmetic> NO
[3:52:20] <ToxInjection> No
[3:52:20] <Deasmeister> You wont
[3:52:21] <Louie_Salmon> Very much impossible
[3:52:21] <+Javaa01> It absolutely is not possible
[3:52:21] <vadnhi> @kyh9 'No Negatives' aside from everyone else with a political leaning despising you and calling you a fence-sitter. :P
[3:52:21] <+Vigonept> NO
[3:52:22] <%hax_metatron> Some thoughts are exclusive
[3:52:22] <genmypoweralready> Impossible
[3:52:22] <iacus_> it's not possible, some are mutually exclusive
[3:52:23] <%krispen_wa> NO
[3:52:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> noooo
[3:52:24] <Johannen> imposible
[3:52:25] <Zomner> NOPE
[3:52:25] <available_line> impossible
[3:52:25] <+Javaa01> Some are mutually exclusive
[3:52:26] <$doomerskeletor13> I think some are mutually exclusive
[3:52:26] <+OblivionSword1> you can't
[3:52:26] <%Firststrike_OW> you cant do it in a single playthrough
[3:52:27] <dds333a> @skagtheprinceofhell I personally thought each Judge would be their own Emperor
[3:52:27] <Eger007> not in 1 playthrough
[3:52:28] <+babyacid> NO
[3:52:31] <deviljhojho_> some are mutually exclusive
[3:52:34] <die_hardman> NO
[3:52:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> It isnt possible but you can totally unlock them with no detriment
[3:52:35] <artificiallynatural> there's too many to get all at once
[3:52:37] <%jepupu> Looks like you can have 12
[3:52:38] <oda_flobunaga> not possible some are mutually exclusive
[3:52:38] <andre11dr> You already missed on some
[3:52:39] <DatAsuna> the downside is you toe dip a million things and go deep on nothing
[3:52:39] <genmypoweralready> You end up with what you end up with
[3:52:40] <+OblivionSword1> not in a single  playthrough
[3:52:40] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus Not only that but it's actively detrimental to try and get everything
[3:52:47] <ingman112> You can unlock most of em if you really try, but you cannot get them all
[3:52:48] <Ids560> some thoughts are only unlocked by failure and others only through success
[3:52:49] <servicesuspension> he was about to drop Advanced Race Theory on you
[3:52:49] <+Bitscreed> No. Pick one of these Communist of Fascist or Centrist or Boring things or...
[3:52:52] <ToxInjection> You'd be wasting skill points at some point. Pick the thoughts you want the character to have. They shape him.
[3:52:54] <+DaSkeeters> There’s too many
[3:52:54] <deviljhojho_> You can do some esoteric stuff tho. I was a communist ultracapitalist
[3:52:57] <primaryfire> you declined advanced race theory
[3:53:00] <aewheros> Merely unlocking them can affect white checks
[3:53:04] <%kyh9> @vadnhi Sure, no negative GAME consequences.  No negatives related to stats or damage or money
[3:53:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pretty much, they're just there if ytou want it
[3:53:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I would NEVER refuse a thought
[3:53:12] <ingman112> At this point only pick the ones you want, you’ve internalized most of the best ones
[3:53:14] <+DenpaDev> There like pokeman
[3:53:14] <dds333a> I'd say you'd be wearing yourself thin
[3:53:16] <%hax_metatron> Solving Kingdom of Conscience has some of the best writing in the game
[3:53:19] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus What's more, some thoughts lock out others, like Aces High and Aces Low
[3:53:26] <+SignScratch> dialogue changes
[3:53:34] <+icekept> wear wifebeater shirt
[3:53:35] <Johannen> Does it change?
[3:53:36] <DatAsuna> it does affect some stuff
[3:53:37] <heemwizard> cant believe i missed aces low the first time
[3:53:37] <yomamma133713> Aces high and low for example are mutually exclusive
[3:53:38] <genmypoweralready> Different dialogue
[3:53:39] <elshadow7> Unlocking a thought does provide new dialogue options, right?
[3:53:40] <DSD24> That was fun
[3:53:45] <+OblivionSword1> NOW PUNCH HIM
[3:53:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> You might get some extra dialogue options for unlocking it but it's not going to radically change anything I think
[3:53:46] <Eger007> speak to the scab
[3:53:47] <+MrAtheGreat> The grey out thoughts are more or less just tips on how to get them
[3:53:49] <ingman112> Dialogue does unlock  and change based on what thoughts you have
[3:53:50] <+icekept> wear shirt
[3:53:50] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Yes, dialogue will change based on thoughts you've unlocked. You called Measurehead a Traitor because you were fascist LUL
[3:53:54] <heemwizard> @Eger007 after he fails
[3:53:56] <DatAsuna> but not as much as it could it committed
[3:53:57] <restingbones> It would be weird if you can go around with all these conflicting ideas in you head with no impact on gameplay
[3:54:09] <servicesuspension> remember to always check your equipment and buffs before trying a check
[3:54:10] <DatAsuna> dialogue gets the small changes not the big ones
[3:54:10] <Blank9> it's not like anyone can read your mind if you don't proceed to speak it
[3:54:10] <+MrAtheGreat> Advanced Race Theory and no I think
[3:54:12] <+icekept> +1 physical instrament
[3:54:14] <tomo_vendor> @restingbones entertaining the thought doesn't mean practicing it
[3:54:19] <primaryfire> advanced race theory doesn't necessarily make you a racist
[3:54:26] <+KillerCrocomire> ^
[3:54:27] <dds333a> I dunno, that IS pretty real
[3:54:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can tell the lorry driver about the race enigma for sure
[3:54:28] <heemwizard> Advanced race theory locks you into being a racist in the end
[3:54:29] <Blank9> you are way overthinking it
[3:54:30] <%akajaybay> optimize your gear for racist punching
[3:54:33] <heemwizard> But you can forget it
[3:54:39] <DatAsuna> there's downsides both ways
[3:54:39] <CubeyXOF> that's the way to play
[3:54:40] <+AJiiij> @tomo_vendor for a little bit that works, yeah
[3:54:42] <spaceitaly> you will want to play this a second time, woolie
[3:54:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You called Measurehead a "Traitor" because of the fascist thought I think BUT ITS NEVER VERY BAD. You wont "ruin" your character ever LUL
[3:54:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> check clothes for phys intrument
[3:54:47] <Davimotion96> @deviljhojho_ Advance race theory allows you to do police racial profiling
[3:54:47] <elshadow7> You'll...figure it out.
[3:54:48] <+icekept> wife beater shirt
[3:54:48] <DatAsuna> Not getting content now denies you more content later
[3:54:52] <+MrAtheGreat> If you forget it the game still labels you as a racist
[3:54:56] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> change clothes @woolieversus
[3:54:57] <dds333a> ALL convos are real
[3:54:59] <Blank9> a thought is just equipping an accessory in a jrpg
[3:55:00] <hassanico2> Does Physical Instrument check improve if he has a crowbar in his hand?

[3:55:10] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Esentially all the ones you unlock subtly change the dialogue, and the ones you equip heavily change it and provide extra bonuses and limits.

[4:00:12] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Why is chat backseating so fucking hard, its his first playthrough.
[4:00:12] <ingman112> @miklosher I think it’s less backseating if we’re just reminding him of stuff we already heard but forgot about

[4:05:30] <restingbones> No, you opted out
[4:05:30] <EviiPaladin> you didn't do it hard enough
[4:05:31] <Gawayne2> Manana had to listen to this man call him a Mule
[4:05:38] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Scab is for punch

[4:06:09] <%Firststrike_OW> RIGHT TO WORK!
[4:06:15] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus That improves the check to get Measurehead to tell you about the Advanced Race Theory I'm guessing
[4:06:15] <TheRealGreaterGamer> REGGIE BRAIN
[4:06:23] <+Count_Viscount> you've exhausted all the options i know
[4:06:29] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Talk to SCAB FIRST
[4:06:35] <depressioncherrie> Could Woolie actually lock himself out of the harbor permanently, if he doesn't manage to either beat Measurehead or get through the door in the courtyard?
[4:06:38] <ingman112> You have clothes
[4:06:39] <ingman112> The tank
[4:06:41] <+OblivionSword1> RIGHT TO WORK
[4:06:42] <ezera123> Scab Leader!
[4:06:43] <+MrAtheGreat> There is something directly to the south of you that would maybe help

[4:07:15] <%krispen_wa> RIGHT TO WORL
[4:07:15] <WakeUpThrow> @depressioncherrie Woolie can try the checks again, he'll be fine
[4:07:17] <%krispen_wa> WORK
[4:07:17] <CubeyXOF> that might have reactivated the check
[4:07:21] <TheRealGreaterGamer> NOW go punch him again LUL
[4:07:21] <+caramelatte1> oo bonus point
[4:07:26] <Gawayne2> Press X to Doubt

[4:07:41] <%alpharius88> Kappa

[4:07:47] <%Juriasu> go punch him again Kappa
[4:07:47] <TheRealGreaterGamer> GO PUNCH RACISM
[4:07:48] <Gawayne2> You can try again now
[4:07:52] <Gawayne2> those affected the chances
[4:07:53] <die_hardman> @iacus_ I think it’s open

[4:08:06] <genmypoweralready> He checked clothes
[4:08:08] <+caramelatte1> clothes
[4:08:15] <gunsrlove> dont forget to SAVE
[4:08:15] <$doomerskeletor13> Doing certain things will up your chances of a check
[4:08:20] <genmypoweralready> You can see on the left, all your bonuses
[4:08:21] <+walternatorz> you don't always need a stat change to retry a white check, new conversations can unlock a retry
[4:08:24] <iacus_> its easier to check on the stats screen
[4:08:26] <Ids560> getting a bonus from elsewhere also unlocks it, like with learning about guillaume from joyce
[4:08:30] <+NYCrownlessKing> any mods in chat?

[4:23:42] <Miklosher> when the skill chimes in
[4:23:42] <Indigo_Automaton> Malding Art Critic
[4:23:43] <mariothemaio> auto-heal
[4:23:43] <ToxInjection> Passive checks I think
[4:23:43] <therustystream> I think
[4:23:45] <primaryfire> they heal morale
[4:23:45] <Press_X_ToJASON> every time conceptualization says anything
[4:23:45] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Conceptualization checks
[4:23:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Passive checks give you morale
[4:23:45] <CubeyXOF> every time conceptualization chimes in
[4:23:46] <%hax_metatron> Annytime a Conceptualization passive suceeds, you heal
[4:23:46] <Strigiform> passive is whenever that thought come sup
[4:23:46] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> whenever conceptualization chimes in
[4:23:46] <elshadow7> Passive checks heal you and give  you xp
[4:23:47] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus I believe the person who was the lead writer for the game was a part of a band that failed
[4:23:47] <%Juriasu> everytime concept shows up you heal and get xp
[4:23:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> every time conceptualization chime in, you heal and get xp
[4:23:47] <bonebagMEL> everytime concept chimes in during a convi
[4:23:47] <Pappajimbo> free heal
[4:23:48] <%andrewofbob> Passive, skill chips in mid conversation
[4:23:48] <+justianxix> passive checks
[4:23:48] <+OblivionSword1> passive concept check heals 1 morale
[4:23:48] <servicesuspension> passives are autochecks
[4:23:48] <+tigerfang86> when the skill talks
[4:23:49] <twoto858> Everytime a passive Concep hits, you get healed
[4:23:49] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Every time you roll a C passive you heal morale
[4:23:49] <Ids560> passive checks like when it chimes in
[4:23:49] <FassieFons> AUTOMATIC CHECKS
[4:23:49] <+Vivaciousx3> passive concept. checks
[4:23:49] <%Arancet> every time concept talks to you
[4:23:51] <Deasmeister> when it chimes in
[4:23:51] <Press_X_ToJASON> you heal and get xp
[4:23:52] <+AJiiij> someone on the writing team was havin it
[4:23:52] <+SignScratch> passive checks
[4:23:53] <punimissile> checks
[4:23:53] <elshadow7> When Concept. chimes in
[4:23:53] <pyshcocanuck> When it talks to you in dialogue
[4:23:54] <candidateplays> when conceptualization talks
[4:23:55] <Picia000123> ITS ONE OF THE BEST
[4:23:57] <TheRealGreaterGamer> whenever con talks you heal morale and get exp
[4:23:57] <genmypoweralready> Heal 1 morale whenever a conceptualization says something
[4:23:57] <+Bitscreed> Autoheal and XP. Good stuff
[4:23:57] <LunarRemix> Everytime Conceptualization chimes in, passes a check it heals one morale and gives 10 XP
[4:23:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea
[4:23:59] <+Mrbaconator> passive checks
[4:24:00] <mariothemaio> yes reggie
[4:24:00] <ToxInjection> Yes
[4:24:02] <genmypoweralready> And xp
[4:24:03] <elshadow7> And XP
[4:24:04] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> so if you pass the passive check, you get healed 1 morale and 10 XP @woolieversus
[4:24:04] <Gawayne2> Conceptualization will heal you when it talks
[4:24:04] <Press_X_ToJASON> it's SUPER good
[4:24:05] <LunarRemix> Yes
[4:24:07] <ingman112> Any conceptualization check that’s not red or white. The automatic ones
[4:24:09] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus Whenever you hear conceptualization you gain +10 xp
[4:24:10] <die_hardman> Dialogue
[4:24:10] <available_line> That sounds EXTREMELY good
[4:24:12] <+MrAtheGreat> Boost that stat
[4:24:12] <Press_X_ToJASON> better if you have high concept
[4:24:16] <iacus_> that permanent -1 tho

[4:32:34] <ingman112> @andre11dr He might have missed the proc’ing dialogue; inland not high enough at the time
[4:32:34] <heemwizard> @AhmCha he did a ko
[4:32:34] <skagtheprinceofhell> He punched a racism and then commited a tatsu
[4:32:36] <hassanico2> Can we see the corpse?
[4:32:38] <AhmCha> Oh, nice, he spinkicked racism
[4:32:39] <AhmCha> Good man
[4:32:42] <+OblivionSword1> @AhmCha he defeated racism
[4:32:46] <Crippl3> I assume you just chucked it out the hole in your window and it blew up here
[4:32:54] <%andrewofbob> @AhmCha Woolie did a MP, 214KK combo
[4:32:57] <+AJiiij> 360 kick flip on dat fool
[4:33:08] <elshadow7> @woolieversus you can press Caps. to toggle run mode
[4:33:11] <peyodogo> ayy made it for disco
[4:33:12] <servicesuspension> So Harry got rid of the cape, the badge and the gun
[4:33:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so if you don't get the tie to tie at the beginning does it never do it later? or is the stat still too low
[4:33:18] <genmypoweralready> @vadnhi Are they in the files? I just used the moralist pants to complete the look
[4:33:23] <yeeyeyee> "this?" [mouses over tare] "no"

[4:33:31] <%BisoromiBear> real fake tare

[4:34:01] <%andrewofbob> Hobocop is opting out of money
[4:34:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:34:03] <servicesuspension> something about this place makes me think about starcraft
[4:34:11] <yeeyeyee> does this game still have the bug where tare will disappear permanently? if you change areas
[4:34:24] <Crippl3> @servicesuspension it's the yellow edges on everything
[4:34:25] <5pencer1001> it feels like the orbital platform starcraft maps
[4:34:37] <vadnhi> @genmypoweralready Yeah. You can find containers with space in the save files and then find the item codes for various things (like the RCP pants) in the files. Just paste them in, and you'll find them where you put them.
[4:34:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> Man, sure is a lot of empty bottles of alcohol near my abandoned jacket
[4:34:43] <+Jeshk0> yuuuup

[4:35:01] <genmypoweralready> @vadnhi Nice
[4:35:09] <vadnhi> @genmypoweralready Sorry. i mean you can find the item codes on the wiki, under the item descriptions.
[4:35:31] <vadnhi> Believe it's "pants_rcp" or somesuch.
[4:35:43] <heemwizard> cant believe they didnt put the pants in the game
[4:35:44] <+DenpaDev> aww "about to"

[4:41:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:41:07] <yeeyeyee> This game does not do that, woolie
[4:41:08] <Johannen> Explores..steps into the no way back cutscene path...misses the button that gives lore
[4:41:10] <Indigo_Automaton> Higher Perception will reveal more interacatbles
[4:41:11] <iacus_> it's good to be cautious
[4:41:13] <Press_X_ToJASON> i believe right click does the same as tab
[4:41:15] <%krispen_wa> EPITAPH
[4:41:16] <+mads_valentine> Woolie was taught wrong, as a joke.
[4:41:17] <+tigerfang86> Chat doesnt think
[4:41:18] <+Vivaciousx3> chat stop
[4:41:18] <+tigerfang86> it's true
[4:41:20] <pi_in_the_sci> the tare is hidden behind a thought, but you can still pick it up
[4:41:23] <GarbageNirvana> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take
[4:41:25] <yeeyeyee> This game, I'm pretty sure, never locks you out from shit just by interacting with it woolie
[4:41:33] <+vaderxyz1970> button unlocks super duper secret ending that doesn't exist
[4:41:36] <%BisoromiBear> But if woolieONEGUY knows it surely you do as well???
[4:41:44] <%ChoculaUltra> chat is an ever swirling mass of chaos
[4:41:44] <ingman112> One guy thinks woolie knows everything about this game
[4:41:45] <+tigerfang86> Reggie chat just wants to build the kingdom of concience
[4:41:49] <yomamma133713> That was a perception intractable fyi which is why it was yellow
[4:41:52] <spaceitaly> i've changed my mind, DON'T press the button
[4:41:53] <Robot_Nixon_> this is a game where a phone call could kill you
[4:41:54] <servicesuspension> chat's idea of fun is telling people things juuuuust before they happen
[4:41:59] <+MapleSyzurp> quelle joueur à l'arrière
[4:42:01] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus Yeah he's saying "Eteindre" wrong
[4:42:02] <ingman112> @servicesuspension DA WORST
[4:42:03] <Timarkot> Do everything perfectly first time
[4:42:06] <GarbageNirvana> local murderer escapes Justice because detective too scared to press buttons
[4:42:12] <heemwizard> i mean chat havent spoiled anything yet
[4:42:13] <%andrewofbob> @ChoculaUltra Almost like Dick Mullen's head
[4:42:25] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @therustystream
[4:42:29] <ingman112> @heemwizard It only takes one
[4:42:29] <genmypoweralready> What stat is chat
[4:42:31] <vadnhi> @heemwizard ...Not for lack of trying, tho.
[4:42:39] <hassanico2> Half-light
[4:42:39] <ingman112> @vadnhi BEAT ME TO IT
[4:42:46] <hassanico2> Chat is always in fight or flight Cuno mode
[4:42:46] <DSD24> Chat is Inland Empire
[4:42:50] <heemwizard> dont worry, most havent played it yet
[4:42:51] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @genmypoweralready Halflight
[4:43:01] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @genmypoweralready all of them yelling at once, especially halflight and reaction speed
[4:43:01] <+Huderga> press on again
[4:43:27] <elshadow7> You mean, *your* girl?
[4:43:29] <servicesuspension> this part feels like a different game
[4:43:34] <%dalmek> Measurehead is dead, long live The Measurehead
[4:43:35] <andre11dr> Ok chat, what are the odds that the roll?
[4:43:38] <StarInRags> The only thing more tempting than a mysterious unlabelled button, is a mysterious button labelled "DO NOT PRESS".  Press everything.
[4:43:38] <5pencer1001> they still thirsting for a ko'd punk
[4:43:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> What tipped you off? "the future belongs to Measurehead?"
[4:43:42] <spaceitaly> more like Pleasurehead, BABY!
[4:43:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL
[4:43:50] <vadnhi> "There must *always* be a Measurehead."
[4:43:57] <aewheros> Prybar? Guess again.
[4:43:59] <%bread_assassin> Did Woolie savescum to punch Measurehead? He failed the check and then I left for a bit.
[4:44:05] <servicesuspension> The Revolution happened because there was no measurehead
[4:44:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You can right click
[4:44:15] <%thatproudgoatface> thatproudgoatface subscribed with Prime. 
[4:44:15] <TheRealGreaterGamer> To equip

[4:44:27] <heemwizard> @bread_assassin no he got a +1 from scab leader
[4:44:30] <BernieSandworm> Measurehead was defeated fair and square
[4:44:30] <yomamma133713> @bread_assassin no
[4:44:31] <%krispen_wa> @bread_assassin he unlocked it again through dialogue then got it in the try afterwards

[4:46:38] <elshadow7> FALN it up!
[4:46:39] <+ALazo> Obligatory 'What's that smell'
[4:46:42] <servicesuspension> FALN
[4:46:43] <heemwizard> half light isnt important
[4:46:43] <%krispen_wa> ADIDAS GLOVES

[4:46:44] <yomamma133713> Intractable down low
[4:46:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Necktie plus occasional lizard brain and limbic system makes 27 friends
[4:46:49] <heemwizard> except for one check
[4:46:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> What the fuck does blood smell like anime
[4:47:02] <Johannen> What's dat Smell?
[4:47:02] <hassanico2> Uh... that's cause you haven't smelled blood then

[4:47:08] <%Juriasu> chi no nioi
[4:47:10] <cumurasame> ...blood smells of iron
[4:47:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does copper smell like blood or does blood smell like copper
[4:47:15] <yeeyeyee> People who don't know what blood smells like are blessed
[4:47:15] <commandantkobold> I love Half-Life
[4:47:16] <+admiral_of_crunch> Blood smells dude
[4:47:17] <servicesuspension> Kingdom Hearts: "You smell like darkness, Riku!"
[4:47:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I guess Im lucky that Ive never had to smell blood before
[4:47:22] <yeeyeyee> Blood smells fucking rank
[4:47:22] <Victory_Boss> Smells like pennies and milk
[4:47:25] <%krispen_wa> IT SINGS TO ME
[4:47:28] <+vaderxyz1970> what's that smell
[4:47:29] <5pencer1001> more like your 24 friends are divided into 2 teams, team lizard brain and team limbic
[4:47:30] <vadnhi> @ReallyBigRocks "The Man with 27 Stands..."
[4:47:35] <%krispen_wa> IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE A MAN SICK
[4:47:37] <twohitgood> blood has a sour smell.
[4:47:50] <DSD24> Yay more FALN stuff
[4:47:51] <skagtheprinceofhell> Never minded the smell of blood, it was gastric acids that smelled horrid and putrid.
[4:47:54] <TheRealGreaterGamer> GREEN ORB
[4:47:54] <commandantkobold> I meant to say that I love half-light but my love for half-life still applies
[4:47:55] <ingman112> Interfacing is the tech/thievery stat, it’s all interacting with objects
[4:47:56] <cumurasame> blood smells like iron and is a bit intoxicating
[4:48:01] <pi_in_the_sci> You missed a pick up behind you
[4:48:02] <commandantkobold> I meant to say that 'I love half-light' but my love for half-life still applies
[4:48:04] <yeeyeyee> I'm surprised a man who grew up in greneda doesn't know what blood smells like though
[4:48:05] <servicesuspension> So FALN is like a mix between Adidas and Caterpillar

[4:53:10] <skagtheprinceofhell> If it's not 100% it's a crap shoot
[4:53:11] <cumurasame> the actual reason why Welsh people are known as sheep shaggers is very fun  the sentence for theft was severe, sometimes even death, but the sentence for fucking a sheep was far less, so if you got caught trying to steal sheep, you'd start fucking it and saying that's why you're here
[4:53:19] <heartlesshealer> @heemwizard laying down the way I was was too comfy for zero degree of yelling, yeah

[5:13:44] <Uselesswhitenoise> you got voliton clothing?
[5:13:51] <pyshcocanuck> You need to talk to him eventually
[5:13:53] <Miklosher> Take the clipboard off to bump up authority
[5:13:54] <+OblivionSword1> get a game plan
[5:13:55] <+mads_valentine> Take drugs.
[5:13:57] <bevyrage> you can't possibly have volition clothing yet
[5:14:03] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Nothing you can do EXCEPT THE DRUG YOU HAVE
[5:14:03] <elshadow7> -2 Authority
[5:14:09] <%Sunriser41> drugs
[5:14:12] <elshadow7> Also, drugs.
[5:14:13] <ingman112> Don’t take drugs for this shit
[5:14:14] <bevyrage> yeah you can only do drug
[5:14:15] <pi_in_the_sci> the drug doesn't help
[5:14:20] <servicesuspension> you can use pyro for psy
[5:14:20] <+zepelinnn1> you literally dont have a clue what stats might help and i love it LUL
[5:14:22] <Miklosher> screw the clipboard
[5:14:23] <Crippl3> remove the ledger
[5:14:25] <FassieFons> take off the clipboard?
[5:14:25] <Indigo_Automaton> Take off notebook
[5:14:26] <%krispen_wa> authority stays up yet you're holding the clipboard
[5:14:28] <+Jeshk0> change your shirt, you dont need phys instr.
[5:14:28] <zanzibarian_hamster> Make him respect your authority, remove ledger
[5:14:29] <bevyrage> just come back when you got a skill point
[5:14:30] <heartlesshealer> half light at 2
[5:14:31] <Gawayne2> the shirt is definitely better for you, especially to get more EXP
[5:14:32] <+SignScratch> I love this boss battle prep
[5:14:33] <heartlesshealer> now at 1
[5:14:33] <+OblivionSword1> take off the ledger maybe  ?
[5:14:34] <%DiscoMatador> we want shivers tho
[5:14:36] <heartlesshealer> extreme fear
[5:14:39] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You cant predict the rolls so just go for it
[5:14:40] <+SignScratch> for a conversation, it's the best
[5:14:42] <servicesuspension> clip makes you look like a dork
[5:14:45] <yomamma133713> Remove the clipboard
[5:14:48] <primaryfire> authority might be good for this, he's a leader
[5:14:51] <+illusiveSaint> !uptime
[5:14:52] <@Moobot> @illusiveSaint WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 15 minutes
[5:14:53] <heemwizard> you can take drugs....
[5:15:03] <+ClericOfSparda> lytLEERY
[5:15:05] <genmypoweralready> Just snort cocaine in front of him
[5:15:05] <Uselesswhitenoise> drugs are for squares
[5:15:08] <+KillerCrocomire> Assert dominance and take drugs in front of him
[5:15:08] <elshadow7> Booo
[5:15:08] <yeeyeyee> At this point i don't think there's even anything woolie can do
[5:15:09] <Fuji808> Might want to take drugs @WoolieVersus
[5:15:09] <%nuttbrain> Kappa
[5:15:13] <yeeyeyee> besides savescumming
[5:15:14] <sushahana> not gonna make it LUL
[5:15:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> remove clipboard, equip [gun] for maximum authority
[5:15:14] <FassieFons> straight edge cop
[5:15:14] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Then go get fucked
[5:15:16] <CubeyXOF> those drugs would be extremely helpful
[5:15:16] <ToxInjection> good man
[5:15:17] <%hax_metatron> But ... drugs are COOL
[5:15:18] <iacus_> full 100% no-drug run
[5:15:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> Microdose on LSD to out-talk a union boss like a real detective
[5:15:21] <Robot_Nixon_> I can hear electrochem crying
[5:15:24] <$doomerskeletor13> Drugs are cool
[5:15:26] <%hax_metatron> Come on man, just once Kappa
[5:15:31] <Johannen> No drugs or AL GUl here, made it fine thru the ame
[5:15:32] <%nuttbrain> take some of these drugs or fuck off Kappa
[5:15:33] <heartlesshealer> no riding the white pony in front of Kim
[5:15:34] <ingman112> That’s a good tack
[5:15:35] <Crippl3> imagine going into a guy's office to negotiate, and before you start he sees you take a huge whiff of psychodelics
[5:15:36] <5pencer1001> remember more concept passive cheks means more xp
[5:15:37] <AlbertoRobert> FYI, passive checks are not rolls, they are the level of the associated stat + 6
[5:15:38] <yeeyeyee> Woolie wants so badly to be able to win for free but he just can't
[5:15:42] <iacus_> reggie pushing for drugs
[5:15:43] <elshadow7> Reggie gets it
[5:15:51] <twohitgood> Harry's got straight edge.
[5:15:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Reggie is Electrochemisty
[5:15:53] <linSP> life is harder without drug
[5:16:02] <heemwizard> its okay as long as its not alcohol
[5:16:02] <iacus_> no.drugging is a valid way to roleplay, guys
[5:16:03] <%hax_metatron> Some drugs >>> Drugs all the time Woolie
[5:16:05] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> And the drugs to heal don't count, I think
[5:16:06] <%Sunriser41> only cowards dont smoke crack
[5:16:08] <+tigerfang86> the choice is woolie's choice to make
[5:16:09] <+KillerCrocomire> everyone takes drugs
[5:16:13] <FassieFons> reggie says HELL YES to drugs
[5:16:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:16:15] <nelsonsaysbooya> Reggie IS electrochemistry. Good call
[5:16:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> The game will acknowledge that you do or do not do ddrugs
[5:16:19] <marcheries> it's a perfectly valid way to go
[5:16:20] <Blank9> Using a launcher is a different version of a character
[5:16:22] <5pencer1001> i admire woolies devotion to the sober path
[5:16:22] <genmypoweralready> Sprinkle some crack on the playthrough
[5:16:26] <Monkeyweed21> it is a BIG choice\
[5:16:29] <Uselesswhitenoise> he's going for the Good Ending
[5:16:30] <yomamma133713> Psychadelics arent bad tbh but you do you
[5:16:32] <servicesuspension> yeah, it got baaaad
[5:16:33] <iacus_> @MegalomaniacalMegalodon that's medicine. that's *different*
[5:16:34] <vadnhi> Algorithm slams you for drug use. :/
[5:16:34] <+tigerfang86> but you were so DISCO woolie
[5:16:35] <nakunattakage> so immediately cut all drugs cold turkey :)
[5:16:40] <+KillerCrocomire> Disco time
[5:16:43] <pi_in_the_sci> The worst night YOU REMEMBER
[5:16:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> The game has HEAVY themes of alcoholism and addiction
[5:16:45] <flyingmulita> but psychs are good for alcoholics Kappa
[5:16:46] <$doomerskeletor13> Drugs are based
[5:16:48] <Pappajimbo> plz
[5:16:49] <+illusiveSaint> it's an good run redemption arc
[5:16:54] <%Sunriser41> worst night so far
[5:16:54] <Johannen> Was it a worst night...or was the awakening from that night the bad part?
[5:16:57] <primaryfire> agreed
[5:17:13] <Pappajimbo> naked drug cop run
[5:17:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's only the worst night because you can't remember all the other nights Kappa
[5:17:16] <%hax_metatron> Yeah, I bet the night itself was great Kappa
[5:17:17] <$doomerskeletor13> Play it the way that feels right to you
[5:17:18] <iacus_> i also did my first playthrough complete no-drug
[5:17:19] <%chandlerofearth> we stan a str8 edge king
[5:17:28] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Woolie keep Harry straight edge
[5:17:37] <ingman112> I think taking the choice seriously is at least the right way to go
[5:17:37] <Miklosher> maybe up drama vs strength with the shirt?
[5:17:39] <servicesuspension> The idea of doing a loadout for a conversation is hilarious
[5:17:42] <marcheries> :)
[5:17:45] <pillowheadgirl> this a looong stream
[5:17:47] <ingman112> Not just doing drugs for the lulz
[5:17:51] <primaryfire> remember stats only matter for passives if you hit even numbers
[5:17:57] <die_hardman> Lol
[5:17:58] <5pencer1001> very art cop to adjust clothing for a conversation
[5:18:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> And it didn't help lol
[5:18:15] <ingman112> @primaryfire Not always true, more like 70%

[5:18:53] <+Jeshk0> the chair is the REAL boss here

[5:19:17] <iacus_> @Crippl3 Ah, good to have confirmation on that. I hoped that's how it would work
[5:19:21] <%andrewofbob> There was a roll to avoid the damage, but you opted in for stright pain
[5:19:23] <%krispen_wa> Kill Harry via chair
[5:19:24] <%hax_metatron> I WAS WAITING FOR THIS LUL

[5:45:36] <alroy900> means The Hate
[5:45:41] <alroy900> or Hatred
[5:45:42] <DatAsuna> it's a movie from 95
[5:45:50] <@chesterr01> LA HAINE

[5:46:07] <+OblivionSword1> Thanks Reggie @chesterr01
[5:46:08] <bonebagMEL> This guy is kind of like a comunist trump
[5:46:13] <laguerrilha> oh yeah La Haine! That movie is great!
[5:46:26] <Crippl3> @bonebagMEL evrart is extremely not a communist
[5:46:37] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @thebalticguy1
[5:46:41] <%Sunriser41> @bonebagMEL except he is actually competent
[5:46:45] <Timarkot> You can put points right now
[5:46:45] <%chandlerofearth> social democrat at best
[5:46:47] <laguerrilha> Wow i didnt know it was a Independent movie
[5:46:49] <DatAsuna> Imagine being an american playing this scene
[5:46:50] <thebalticguy1> wait did that end the task
[5:47:00] <die_hardman> @datasuna ?
[5:47:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Youre fine
[5:47:16] <heemwizard> you wouldnt be able to
[5:47:17] <%xeromage> "I don't even care about the gun. Fuck you." -Pat Cop
[5:47:18] <%hax_metatron> You can come back to Evrart
[5:47:19] <%Arnoldoaad1> you can do that still
[5:47:20] <heemwizard> the exit was locked
[5:47:21] <thebalticguy1> might be able to go back afterwards
[5:47:21] <mariothemaio> you couldn't have, you were locked out
[5:47:22] <ToxInjection> That could still apply. A lot of dialogue options refresh.
[5:47:23] <elshadow7> What Reggie said
[5:47:25] <therustystream> you couldn't have gone back at the time
[5:47:28] <ingman112> You couldn’t go back
[5:47:32] <DatAsuna> @die_hardman the land of unsecured guns with ammo
[5:47:53] <yeeyeyee> @ingman112 you technically can, but you get nothing out of it
[5:48:16] <heemwizard> well you can choose not to bring it up now
[5:48:21] <heemwizard> then bring it up later
[5:48:30] <heemwizard> after you visit the whirling
[5:48:30] <therustystream> how could you hurt your friend like that
[5:48:30] <die_hardman> @datasuna would probably think the same thing most other people would tbh. Speaking as an American familiar w gun laws.
[5:49:05] <ToxInjection> Nice. I
[5:49:05] <WakeUpThrow> I hate Evrart so much
[5:49:07] <DatAsuna> @die_hardman pretend I wrote /sarcasm if that makes it clearer
[5:49:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He isnt Team Kim? Fuck him
[5:49:11] <mariothemaio> Team Harry
[5:49:12] <servicesuspension> Kim called you Harry ;_;
[5:49:15] <he1lhydra> #TeamKim
[5:49:16] <ingman112> @yeeyeyee The door is shut and the other way’s inaccessible? So not sure how. Although you’re right about the second part
[5:49:17] <heysamuel> is that the first time kim calls you harry because oh my heart
[5:49:17] <%Sunriser41> nah, fuck harry, team kim is the one
[5:49:18] <%hax_metatron> Evrart at the end of the game, is an insane character
[5:49:18] <Indigo_Automaton> But Harry is Team Kim
[5:49:20] <%hax_metatron> Written so well
[5:49:20] <elshadow7> Kim actually called you Harry
[5:49:26] <%kyh9> I’m team Evrart!
[5:49:32] <spaceitaly> TEAM KIM
[5:49:36] <+OblivionSword1> huh I never noticed that

[5:50:59] <thebalticguy1> Where's Nick Sobotka
[5:50:59] <heysamuel> "i would never do this" *immediately does it*
[5:51:01] <Gawayne2> What an odd reaction
[5:51:01] <Indigo_Automaton> wha
[5:51:01] <%KetsuoTaberu> I hate this guy
[5:51:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> we're all just pals

[5:51:18] <thebalticguy1> We need Valchek on this guys ass
[5:51:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> no midgets here
[5:51:30] <terramagus> Sounds legit
[5:51:30] <%kyh9> Rhetoric and Suggestion on this guy are MAXED out
[5:51:31] <nojjod420> "some of my best friends are little people"
[5:51:31] <therustystream> that darn casserole
[5:51:43] <%alpharius88> you can only respect such strong boss full of bs...
[5:51:45] <Gawayne2> It's weird. Him and the Racist Lorryman both make comments that imply Harry's relatively short.

[5:52:17] <+illusiveSaint> we're friends :)
[5:52:18] <ToxInjection> I ain't your buddy, pal
[5:52:18] <sionteemo405> we're 'pals' LUL
[5:52:21] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Evrart is the best
[5:52:22] <spaceitaly> evrart is good, evrart is my pal
[5:52:22] <therustystream> I like Evrart a lot guys trust me
[5:52:22] <%Firststrike_OW> LUL
[5:52:22] <BernieSandworm> so honest and nice :)
[5:52:23] <DatAsuna> that's the most honest thing he's said all day
[5:52:24] <%hax_metatron> He's basically a slimy Joyce. Joyce hides it all beneath a veneer of "niceness"
[5:52:25] <linSP> So, here’s how Evrart can still WIN
[5:52:27] <%Irridium> This is Randy Pitchford level of grease
[5:52:34] <iacus_> that BURN to David cage
[5:52:38] <BerryliciousDefinition> Postive vibes only!
[5:52:56] <%ChoculaUltra> so greasy I feel like I have to take another shower monkaS
[5:52:56] <DatAsuna> @linSP who would win, evrart or jehuty?
[5:53:04] <terramagus> "She just doesn't feel like getting past my flaming moat."
[5:53:10] <elshadow7> She just has to best Measurehead in combat
[5:53:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok.
[5:53:35] <terramagus> "The invisible hand of the free market can unlock my door with a shotgun rigged to it"
[5:53:35] <%kyh9> Your skills are losing to his suggestion.  I don’t know if you can win actually
[5:53:56] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL
[5:53:56] <servicesuspension> that's terryfying
[5:53:58] <%PMAvers> The Evaratt is final form of The Cuno
[5:54:00] <elshadow7> Evrart refers to himself in the 3rd person  too
[5:54:04] <restingbones> Evrart dont fucin care
[5:54:09] <+Sunriser41> god i forgot about your skills losing dialogue battles
[5:54:18] <+illusiveSaint> listening to again evrart is so good
[5:54:39] <Miklosher> Congrats you barely survived the encounter
[5:54:42] <servicesuspension> that was so goddamn tense
[5:54:44] <$arcielardor> hahaha
[5:54:44] <%DevilHands_> heh
[5:54:46] <sionteemo405> lmao
[5:54:46] <Monkeyweed21> are you sure you dont want your gun?

[5:54:49] <skagtheprinceofhell> So drugs?!
[5:54:49] <zanzibarian_hamster> ?
[5:54:50] <heysamuel> boss battle: won?
[5:54:52] <laguerrilha> COngrats you survived
[5:54:54] <+DaSkeeters> Not us we
[5:54:54] <therustystream> boss fight complete
[5:55:01] <Miklosher> was that a win?
[5:55:07] <Timarkot> Draw
[5:55:09] <andre11dr> So was that boss fight beaten?
[5:55:10] <skagtheprinceofhell> @heysamuel Survived.
[5:55:10] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> He CAN'T go out
[5:55:12] <%Sunriser41> did we win?

[5:55:13] <sionteemo405> nah that was a we survived LUL
[5:55:15] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He moves the container lol
[5:55:17] <heysamuel> "survived"
[5:55:21] <+babyacid> you have ....already been played
[5:55:25] <servicesuspension> I don't think we can call this a victory
[5:55:28] <die_hardman> Don’t forget to talk to measurehead
[5:55:30] <vadnhi> @WoolieVersus What if you come back and Evart is *weilding* the Masamune, Woolie? O_o
[5:55:34] <Johannen> Kingdom of Concience time?
[5:55:35] <Fuji808> @Timarkot Whoops, sorry
[5:55:39] <the_angelon_experience> save it!
[5:55:43] <+OblivionSword1> put more into SHIVERS
[5:55:45] <Indigo_Automaton> End is good
[5:55:45] <laguerrilha> Espirit de Cops for more stories
[5:55:47] <Johannen> Good idea
[5:55:49] <Miklosher> More VOLITION maybe
[5:55:53] <%alpharius88> Perception?
[5:55:54] <elshadow7> Those motorics looking pretty low
[5:55:56] <primaryfire> empathy or esprit de corps at 4 might be good
[5:55:56] <Fuji808> Funny, I always wondered how Sephiroth got that Masamune back.
[5:55:58] <%chandlerofearth> save it for the hardie boys
[5:56:04] <iacus_> volition is pt high
[5:56:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Thoughts should take precedence over skills until you max the slots imo
[5:56:10] <%Sunriser41> should talk to measurehead
[5:56:10] <vadnhi> @Fuji808 He had a spare...
[5:56:18] <terramagus> Did he talk to the Hardies?
[5:56:21] <%hax_metatron> 9 PM

[5:58:30] <Johannen> You seen like 60% of the map

[5:59:45] <+Dova573> As an AXL player my Options were to BLOCK
[5:59:49] <servicesuspension> Thank you for this sesh, Woolie and Reggie. Goodbye :D
[5:59:52] <%andrewofbob> LONG
[5:59:58] <+Dova573> And then run away
[6:00:04] <Crippl3> did woolie fight any Vtubers this time?
[6:00:05] <andre11dr> Yeah Sol is really good in Strive right now
[6:00:23] <andre11dr> Or he feels like unga ass hell
[6:01:03] <+Mrbaconator> holy jesus fuck that combo is NASTY
[6:01:22] <+Mrbaconator> that is DISGUSTING
[6:01:25] <ToxInjection> s w a g
[6:01:35] <%ChoculaUltra> that is definitely a "hold that" type of combo
[6:01:54] <+Mrbaconator> i hope many characters can do that shit regardless if i can pull it off
[6:01:56] <+Dova573> The thing is I'm worried is that this is a Sol only thing
[6:02:16] <WakeUpThrow> Sol feels like a character designed for Strive, and the others feel like they were just put there to me
[6:02:23] <xeros720> make your own story
[6:02:32] <terramagus> Always shoryuken Measurehead
[6:02:42] <laguerrilha> I prefer not to internaliza his ideology
[6:02:47] <Estwilde> y'all don't need to say every alternate path as it happens. Keep those hidden until they're played again :)
[6:02:57] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Exactly, I just thought you should know that that was an option
[6:02:58] <terramagus> Plus, skill points on thoughts are valuable
[6:03:02] <ToxInjection> There's so much content in this game, nobody should really be stressed about "missing anything"
[6:03:08] <primaryfire> again, it's not about accepting his ideaology, it's just about learning what it's about. if you accept it or criticise it is your decision afterwards
[6:03:38] <primaryfire> but it's fine
[6:04:12] <terramagus> Don't feel bad about being communist. You're Canadian. None of us had a chance.
[6:04:24] <+illusiveSaint> this is a game where you wish you can play for the first time again
[6:04:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Speaking of that, did you look up the Emile fight from Automata yet? LUL
[6:04:38] <WakeUpThrow> Nice!
[6:04:42] <+OblivionSword1> YEAH THO BOYS ARE BACK
[6:04:55] <Estwilde> I wouldn't stress on "content" choices at all. This game has so much that even if it feels like you're ending up on a "sucky" path, so far as a viewer it's still super interesting seeing things turn out different
[6:05:01] <vadnhi> Salt Party! - It's back! ...In Pog-Form! :D
