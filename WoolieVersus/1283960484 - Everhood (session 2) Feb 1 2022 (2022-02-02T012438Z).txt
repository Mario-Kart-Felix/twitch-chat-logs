[0:01:40] <Blank9> It’d be like seeing a tgs gameplay video
[0:01:43] <leith_aziz> Why is it called the PSX again? Wouldnt that imply PS10? cohhHmm
[0:01:49] <%Indigo_Automaton> I can't believe Fromsoft plagiarized their own PS1 game
[0:02:05] <+Mrbaconator> i care more about landing baiken parry than i do winning matches tenmamOvie

[0:05:34] <leith_aziz> Dolphin parry pickyDrool
[0:05:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The times where Reggie is left alone on mic are the best parts of the stream
[0:05:47] <+Mrbaconator> any cutscene super is the most free parry in the world unless you committed to a move
[0:05:47] <leith_aziz> Run up parry, coward
[0:05:56] <exnuart> trying to play chaos as a nago main has me so fucked up. i forget theres mobility
[0:05:56] <%legacy0117> Mamaaaaaa I didn’t mean to make you crrrryyyy.

[0:06:05] <+Mrbaconator> IT RULES
[0:06:09] <CoffeeCobra> I never played a single Witcher game in my life but I found you can play that whole game without ever parrying, just roll LUL
[0:06:13] <@Menitta> that's me but grabs
[0:06:28] <+Laycas49> First couple bosses
[0:06:29] <%Indigo_Automaton> First zone basically
[0:06:30] <exnuart> bloodborne psx has 2 bosses
[0:06:31] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[0:06:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Probably an hour or two

[0:07:01] <theanora1> trip him
[0:07:03] <@Squdnate> I'm a Giovanna main, so my main goal is to run up and heavy slash, which means I loose 90% of my matches
[0:07:05] <+cubbywolf> sit in THE CHAIR and turn on THE GAME and assume THE CONTROL
[0:07:11] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Not enough time to get past that title screen lol

[0:07:38] <%mr_sups> "Turn the other cheek"
[0:07:39] <%ozzrabbit> Hey Reggie, how's your streaming Rig? Will you be able to join Woolie when he eventually gets dragged into Final Fantasy 14 after he finishes the 9 remaster?
[0:07:39] <CoffeeCobra> @WoolieVersus since you guys liked Sayonara Wild Hearts, maybe you guys would enjoy The Artful Escape or Solar Ash? It's by the same publisher and both are great games.
[0:07:40] <LoneFonte> might be possivel to finish Everhood this stream, i think
[0:07:40] <+projectmanatees> na jesus whipped some people
[0:07:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> He whipped those dudes one time and knocked over tables
[0:07:43] <+cubbywolf> for a made up guy he is sure pasifist
[0:07:44] <+Mrbaconator> non canon jesus
[0:07:44] <zanzibarian_hamster> He threw tables at those merchants or something
[0:07:45] <Onamar> He told people to sell their cloaks to buy swords
[0:07:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:07:55] <+cubbywolf> Korean Jesus isn't getting pushed down
[0:07:57] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[0:07:59] <theanora1> Jesus throwing hands
[0:07:59] <leith_aziz> Sounds interesting
[0:08:01] <+Mr_Pylon> He gets knocked down, then he gets up again
[0:08:02] <ZeeJiggle> That sounds like a threat lol
[0:08:06] <%mr_sups> More Bible DLC
[0:08:12] <+Kyma1020> Jesus flipped tables of rich folks
[0:08:15] <+Mrbaconator> jesus said bitch you won't land this parry
[0:08:16] <%andrewofbob> Book of Enoch DLC?
[0:08:24] <%LastHazzerd> makes the whole world blind or somethin
[0:08:28] <Jaysky> SIMON! TURN THE OTHER CHEEEEEEK
[0:08:30] <exnuart> turn the other cheek with the backhand
[0:08:35] <Treasure_Vault> fuck that fig bush and all fig bushes forever -Jdawg
[0:08:38] <+cubbywolf> Jesus slaps your girl on her ass and looks at you and says WHAT YOU GUNNA DO? what do you do? What do you do?
[0:08:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> dum dum dum dum dum
[0:08:41] <leith_aziz> I'm not Christian, so I cant speak on this sadly cohhHmm
[0:08:48] <+cubbywolf> those natives where white once
[0:08:50] <%Lion_kun> Then there was a race across America.
[0:08:50] <+Akizea> Bible mugen
[0:08:55] <+cubbywolf> but sin turned them red
[0:08:57] <CoffeeCobra> @WoolieVersus since you guys liked Sayonara Wild Hearts, maybe you guys would enjoy The Artful Escape or Solar Ash? It's by the same publisher.
[0:08:57] <%Prevot> hanged out with the Vikings in america
[0:08:57] <%Lion_kun> A steel ball run race.
[0:09:00] <+cubbywolf> I just watched south park so i know
[0:09:02] <%legacy0117> Jesus could get angry, especially about money changers in the church.
[0:09:02] <%baka_sugoi> Jesus lore is Inconsistent
[0:09:09] <+AndrewsLovesPizza> jesus wandering like Ryu
[0:09:11] <Jaysky> @cubbywolf You do what Jesus does and slap his ass
[0:09:15] <%Tearonex> Jesus is JOJO canon
[0:09:20] <konarius> @cubbywolf Sending packing back to his dad of course
[0:09:34] <+cubbywolf> two very good answers
[0:09:40] <%legacy0117> Guy brandished a chain whip when that happened.
[0:09:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DEAD SPACE WOO
[0:09:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> YEYEYE DDeadspace
[0:09:58] <%Shad0wTag> You did
[0:09:59] <BlackermanZX> man Dead Space is amazing
[0:10:00] <+cubbywolf> i'd watch that
[0:10:01] <exnuart> dead space remake?
[0:10:06] <%Tearonex> Tearonex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[0:10:07] <%Prevot> is dead space short?
[0:10:07] <leith_aziz> I've been getting the feeling with chat this week that you're guys who like to collect all the lore and then get jaded by it. Not judging yall, but I hope you dont get overwhelmed by it
[0:10:07] <+cubbywolf> Vtubers beat woolie to it and it'
[0:10:07] <Blank9> Pretty good
[0:10:12] <leith_aziz> cohhNotes
[0:10:14] <+cubbywolf> it's been long enough for him to play now
[0:10:24] <Darkdrill> KomodoHype pog i made it in time
[0:10:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 2 is amazing
[0:10:29] <%Indigo_Automaton> Dead Space 2 is also great
[0:10:29] <+projectmanatees> 2 still good
[0:10:29] <%riffsofdylheim> dead space, oh we are in for a treat
[0:10:39] <leith_aziz> Dead Space fans like 2 too, but for different reasons than 1
[0:10:40] <exnuart> dead space 1 and 2 are great. 3 is like the RE6 of it all
[0:10:42] <%Tearonex> First and Second are still amazing
[0:10:43] <@Menitta> 2 is what I hear is fantastic
[0:10:44] <BlackermanZX> 2 still holds up
[0:10:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> All mining tools
[0:10:55] <%Lion_kun> DS has great guns
[0:11:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> Improvised weapons
[0:11:03] <%LastHazzerd> Dead space is to Alien as Dead Space 2 is to Aliens
[0:11:05] <leith_aziz> I guess it's like the RE4/5. While DS1 is the OG RE
[0:11:05] <konarius> @exnuart DS 3 is not as fun as RE6 tho
[0:11:06] <BlackermanZX> 3 fucked it up... but it may be fun in co op
[0:11:08] <@Menitta> enemies react to enemies in really different ways which is cool
[0:11:15] <%Reveresao> Are you ready for the vibes chat!!
[0:11:21] <CoffeeCobra> I know Pat played Solar Ash but never finished it :(
[0:11:23] <@Menitta> react to weapons*
[0:11:24] <%Prevot> DS1 is RE4, DS2 is RE5
[0:11:38] <leith_aziz> @CoffeeCobra Not everyone ends up enjoying what you like sadly
[0:11:46] <%LastHazzerd> i imagine that'll take some doing
[0:11:56] <@Squdnate> @Prevot That comment makes me angry for some reason. Don't do that >:(
[0:12:08] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[0:12:35] <+Laycas49> @Prevot I don't like how real this is
[0:12:37] <Champstice> I said it last stream, but thanks again for streaming Everhood! Great to see more folks enjoying one of my faves from the last few years
[0:12:42] <exnuart> gonna wait for the dead space 1 remake or jump into the old version?
[0:12:53] <leith_aziz> @exnuart It's getting a remake?
[0:12:54] <varlinn> @Prevot Does that make DS3 RE8?
[0:12:56] <Champstice> No reason for Darkstalkers to be dead either
[0:13:00] <CoffeeCobra> @leith_aziz yeah I know, but I figured I'd ask since they're the only people I know who streamed and enjoyed Sayonara Wild Hearts
[0:13:08] <+Laycas49> I would love to see Reggie play Metal Gear Rising someday
[0:13:09] <BlackermanZX> i need Rival Schools in my life
[0:13:10] <leith_aziz> Im an Arcsys boy myself
[0:13:17] <@Menitta> can I say mega man legends
[0:13:18] <%Lion_kun> DS remake is so unneeded, Dead Space still holds up great.
[0:13:18] <exnuart> i cant believe capcom murdered darkstalkers with that 2013 one
[0:13:25] <+Jiggisnipe> @Prevot that's really an apt comparison especially because people talk about how fun DS2 is co-op
[0:13:32] <thaprinnydood> Darkstalkers by the former Skullgirls Devs @WoolieVersus
[0:13:32] <+cubbywolf> but dem devil boobs
[0:13:34] <%Shad0wTag> A 3D fighter would stick out more
[0:13:35] <konarius> man Rival Schools were next to "whatever it was called" 3D Street Fighter at the arcade...
[0:13:37] <@Squdnate> No love for Red Earth </3
[0:13:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Morrigan Fan Excited To Play Darkstalkers For First Time (me)
[0:14:00] <leith_aziz> I'll give Darkstalkers respect for giving Arcsys a lot of inspiration for their ideas
[0:14:04] <exnuart> everyone is just horny for morrigan and felicia. and maybe hsein-ko
[0:14:09] <konarius> God I never touched a 3D Street Fighter, including recen ones.
[0:14:17] <@Menitta> I'd be way more interested in a new Rival Schools
[0:14:20] <+Laycas49> @CanadianAnimatorGuy You and every Baiken main in GGS lol
[0:14:25] <BlackermanZX> also not capcom but goddamit i need a new Bloody Roar
[0:14:37] <%Shad0wTag> Morrigabn fans woolieVS Baiken fans, who wins?
[0:14:42] <+InvisiblessedReptile> We are not going to see a new Morrigan 2D sprite, this ship has sailed. Let's just play the older games on fightcade
[0:14:44] <+PatchTheSquid> Bloody Roar would be S-tier
[0:14:49] <leith_aziz> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Well, at least Baiken "fans" actually play Baiken now
[0:14:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[0:15:32] <+Laycas49> I love all the people that see Baiken as waifu material when her personality is that of a 64 year old tired man lol

[0:15:36] <Jaysky> Capcom vs Woolie
[0:16:03] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @Jaysky Woolie Vs Capcom Vs Capcom
[0:16:14] <Champstice> @Laycas49 Bold of you to assume people look past the booba at the character's personality
[0:16:15] <leith_aziz> @LastHazzerd You're aware that there are some people who like Baiken because she's badass, and not that they're horny cohhHmm
[0:16:35] <leith_aziz> Maybe it helps that I watch the lore to care cohhNotes
[0:16:54] <konarius> Capcom vs SNK, with capcom bankrupting itself to pay for SNK to do hand drawn sprites and both getting bought by Apple.
[0:17:02] <@Menitta> Darkstalkers is WEIRD
[0:17:02] <@Squdnate> @leith_aziz As someone who has played GG since the first one. I don't think these people exist.
[0:17:13] <CoffeeCobra> I don't play fighting games so this is whitenoise to my ears LUL
[0:17:22] <CoffeeCobra> ignorance is bless they say LUL
[0:17:27] <CoffeeCobra> BLISS*
[0:17:28] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Maximillion is right there, but keep living that fantasy
[0:17:52] <+Laycas49> @leith_aziz That sounds like someone horny for Baiken would say
[0:17:56] <@Squdnate> Max plays her for the boobs, we all know that.
[0:17:56] <Darkdrill> team up supers are the best
[0:17:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> no wordle today huh Kappa
[0:18:23] <+Akizea> yeah baiken is absolutely super cool. samurai characters are super cool naturally lol
[0:18:27] <CoffeeCobra> Wordle has had it's own game shows in my country before Wordle was even a thing, it's called Lingo
[0:18:28] <Jaysky> Wordle hint; nyannNers
[0:18:31] <slipdog> cusm
[0:18:36] <Darkdrill> reggie and woolie vs wordle
[0:18:37] <DSD24> I miss Darkstalkers
[0:18:48] <%baka_sugoi> FGC Lore
[0:18:57] <DSD24> I played the PSP version! I loved that game
[0:19:06] <%amaranthos> amaranthos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Who would win, Actiblizz Microsoft or EA Bethesda Apple
[0:19:35] <Jaysky> In an alternative universe Woolie did lore video explanations for the Fate series
[0:19:43] <+Laycas49> Lmao that looked like woolie took a look at the chat and said "nah"
[0:19:53] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Whoever wins, we lose
[0:19:55] <+cubbywolf> the amercian economy is what wins
[0:19:59] <leith_aziz> The latter sounds more like a bag of crap
[0:19:59] <+Jiggisnipe> win what?
[0:19:59] <@Menitta> the answer is no
[0:20:00] <slipdog> todd puts bobby to sleep with 1
[0:20:03] <%Prevot> no matter who wins, we all lose
[0:20:04] <BlackermanZX> we would hope for mutual destruction
[0:20:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> Apple has more money so I guess them
[0:20:14] <Darkdrill> EA Bethesda Apple Applle and EA are a killer combo they would wipe there hands clean with all the blood
[0:20:14] <exnuart> well bethesda made the FPS. they said so at e3
[0:20:15] <%Indigo_Automaton> Meta + Amazon = Metazon
[0:20:21] <%X2Eliah> New York Times bought Wordle. So daddy Bezos owns all, again.
[0:20:26] <leith_aziz> @Jaysky Well, let's be glad he made the right choice (personally)
[0:20:42] <+Shonen_hero> the rich are getting a head start on the eating part, and they've started eating eachother
[0:20:47] <leith_aziz> Sony's made it pretty clear they have more buyouts on the way
[0:20:49] <%andrewofbob> Planetside 3?
[0:20:51] <leith_aziz> cohhSus
[0:20:52] <CaptainBright> Bapcom, Blatinum Games and Bromsoftware; truly the 3Bs
[0:20:54] <+Jiggisnipe> @X2Eliah Bezos owns the Washington Post not NYT
[0:20:54] <+cubbywolf> Cola wars flashbacks
[0:20:57] <exnuart> time to go indie
[0:20:57] <Jaysky> Oh boy.
[0:21:03] <DracaenaLeaf> button?
[0:21:12] <+Shonen_hero> god, please not Capcom
[0:21:12] <leith_aziz> Cant help but feel that this is moving pretty fast
[0:21:13] <Darkdrill> late stage capitalism  Buy everything who can compete now XD
[0:21:14] <%LastHazzerd> they saw the crossplay starting and thought "absolutely not"
[0:21:15] <%X2Eliah> @Jiggisnipe Oh? Hm... so who was it that owned nyt
[0:21:15] <Jaysky> I just want games available on pc
[0:21:19] <+Shonen_hero> please not Capcom
[0:21:21] <Champstice> Eh, I feel like the reason they bought them Because they made halo at some point, ain't cuz of destiny "enjoy all this content we're removing from the game!" 2
[0:21:21] <konarius> none of the companies bought and sold made a game I was interested in a decade
[0:21:23] <CoffeeCobra> @DracaenaLeaf they have the game open UL
[0:21:26] <CoffeeCobra> LUL
[0:21:31] <Champstice> Sending a message
[0:21:33] <DracaenaLeaf> ye lol
[0:21:38] <CoffeeCobra> wow I'm taking big Ls here with my shitty keyboard
[0:21:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> UbiQuantiVision
[0:21:43] <BlackermanZX> i can only wish for someone to buy Konami's entire gaming division/IPs
[0:21:48] <leith_aziz> Isnt Apple behind Mac?
[0:21:54] <@Menitta> apple wouldn't do anything involved with console/PC dev
[0:21:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:21:57] <Champstice> @BlackermanZX this times 100000
[0:21:59] <exnuart> sony might be looking into a new exxclusive GAS game
[0:22:02] <%X2Eliah> @leith_aziz Not lately, they are all in on ios
[0:22:02] <leith_aziz> If you're a student, it's likely you own one
[0:22:04] <%Prevot> apple, Google or Facebook buying any of these companies would be the worst
[0:22:11] <+Shonen_hero> didn't Microsoft already buy Bethesda though? I feel like that ship has sailed
[0:22:16] <Darkdrill> where fighting you with money LUL Now
[0:22:20] <DSD24> Timeline Denied
[0:22:42] <leith_aziz> Konami's too busy with Gacha and Pachinko
[0:22:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Japan made gachas, suddenly money no longer an issue, HMMMMM
[0:22:58] <CoffeeCobra> -business talk- mom come pick me up I'm scared
[0:23:00] <+Jiggisnipe> @X2Eliah publicly traded, it's largest shareholders are like big investment companies
[0:23:00] <%Lion_kun> Konami can't be bought, it's a front for money laundering
[0:23:05] <%ChoculaUltra> If Sony was smart, they'd get Bungie to slap together a proof of concept for a Killzone reboot/revival
[0:23:06] <leith_aziz> Maybe? pickyShrug
[0:23:11] <Darkdrill> Tensen would Wipe Capcom like a dirty blanket
[0:23:26] <leith_aziz> I see it as a cointoss, and either outcomes have merit in terms of likely-hood
[0:23:44] <JonnyJug> Sounds like Activision
[0:23:46] <+Shonen_hero> they've already said they wouldn't sell. Also, Nintendo will never sell, ever. They laughed in Microsoft's face when they made the offer
[0:23:51] <+cubbywolf> fuck konami
[0:23:59] <leith_aziz> GIVE US MGR2!
[0:24:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Metal Gear go DOWN
[0:24:03] <leith_aziz> pickyAngy
[0:24:03] <DSD24> We got Bloody Roar PSYCHE
[0:24:09] <Darkdrill> Konami is sleeping on gold LUL
[0:24:12] <DSD24> Hudson's super dead
[0:24:14] <%ChoculaUltra> I think the Castlevania NFTs kinda showed how Konami views the IPs they've been holding on to but not using
[0:24:16] <AncyentMarinere> Max thinks Capcom, Sega, or maybe Rockstar PogChamp
[0:24:16] <+Jiggisnipe> Konami would never sell. They have mobile and gacha money also they'll license their ips
[0:24:19] <BlackermanZX> Silent Hill
[0:24:22] <Jaysky> I got the goods
[0:24:30] <@Menitta> this is a time where to me it's actively not fun to follow game news lol
[0:24:34] <+Shonen_hero> god, Konami gets bought out, and hires Kojima to direct a new Metal Gear
[0:24:36] <%LastHazzerd> welcome to month 2
[0:24:39] <exnuart> rockstar isn't going anywhere unless 2k gets bought
[0:24:41] <@Menitta> which makes me sad.
[0:24:49] <+Shonen_hero> it's a feeding frenzy
[0:24:49] <+Jiggisnipe> Rockstar is owned by Take Two
[0:24:59] <exnuart> @Jiggisnipe yea that one
[0:25:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Kojima wouldn't even want to do another Metal Gear if even if he owned the IP himself lmao
[0:25:08] <leith_aziz> @Menitta I've been in a weird slump state this week when it comes to gaming. For some reason I dont feel as passionate as I usually am. Would not be suprised if its because of all the gaming news I've watched
[0:25:12] <CoffeeCobra> I'm pretty new to watching Woolie live, do they usually chat this much beforehand? LUL
[0:25:18] <Darkdrill> as long as there are two Kappa we should be fine right ???
[0:25:25] <leith_aziz> NFT news feel daily at this point pickyPalm
[0:25:29] <+Shonen_hero> @ChoculaUltra oh you're super right, but the idea tickles me a little bit
[0:25:32] <+cubbywolf> unionizing seems to be trending. Send in the mega corps
[0:25:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> I can't believe we're doing this giant megacorporation, workers rights shit AGAIN

[0:25:56] <Darkdrill> PogChamp tere the best PC builders
[0:25:59] <jayunderscorez> I feel like Konami's like a tiny pokemon company the way they own Yu Gi Oh games that print money
[0:26:05] <leith_aziz> @CoffeeCobra Us or Woolie?
[0:26:08] <+PkSilent01> oh no Reggie has been Mike Wiskosi
[0:26:08] <+capybruhArt> @ReallyBigRocks never stopped
[0:26:10] <%ChoculaUltra> @Shonen_hero now remakes/remasters of the older games? that I could see. Kojima would just have to give a few greenlights here and there
[0:26:21] <+Jiggisnipe> @jayunderscorez yea
[0:26:25] <+Laycas49> @jayunderscorez Konami makes all of its money from Medical Equipment and Pachinko machines
[0:26:30] <konarius> ha, streaming the build process is kinda cool
[0:26:37] <%Indigo_Automaton> woolieYE
[0:26:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> @capybruhArt It got a little better for about a century at least lmao

[0:26:52] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah the gyms/health centers Konami owns are actually very well equipped from the videos/pics available
[0:26:58] <Arqartur0> So, I just got caught up in the last Stream and um... It's a doozy
[0:26:58] <exnuart> that subtitle tho
[0:26:59] <leith_aziz> @CoffeeCobra This is common
[0:27:01] <gamefan6219> Undertale starring Geno

[0:27:19] <Yomamma1337> hoping you eventually get to the super bosses
[0:27:23] <Arqartur0> @ChoculaUltra Do they have Boxes to hide in while working out?
[0:27:28] <jayunderscorez> @jayunderscorez I didn't realize they had a stake in mediacal equipment - They're def set money wise then
[0:27:34] <CoffeeCobra> I don't mean that in a bad way I'm just not used to it since the only person I watch a lot never does that unless he has to rant about Aldi or something else stupid
[0:28:03] <leith_aziz> I dont mind it. They help bring me up to speed on any recent big news
[0:28:09] <leith_aziz> cohhNotes
[0:28:10] <gamefan6219> @WoolieVersus  this game should have epilepsy warning
[0:28:12] <$tkuwari> Remember kids, dont do drugs. Unless they're good
[0:28:18] <+Jiggisnipe> @CoffeeCobra who rants about Aldi? lol
[0:28:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It does
[0:28:24] <exnuart> oh yea epilepsy warning to the chat
[0:28:26] <slipdog> we wont get another MGS but we could get another mgr..  sajamSolphisticated
[0:28:31] <CoffeeCobra> @Jiggisnipe vargskelethor Joel
[0:28:38] <+Jiggisnipe> interesting
[0:28:49] <exnuart> joel rants about strange things
[0:28:57] <exnuart> especially the wasps in his room
[0:28:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:28:58] <CoffeeCobra> yeah but they're funny
[0:28:59] <gamefan6219> @exnuart the gnome boss can make people sick, so they have to be careful
[0:29:02] <leith_aziz> @slipdog Give me that copium doodNuts
[0:29:31] <gamefan6219> @WoolieVersus This is basically undertale ft geno
[0:29:34] <+Shonen_hero> and then you had some wild boss fight
[0:29:35] <leith_aziz> cohhGV cohhBongos cohhGV
[0:30:03] <Arqartur0> Ever since The start of The Troubles in Blizzard, I gave up on "whens X"... Starcraft was the game I wanted all this time
[0:30:21] <gamefan6219> @WoolieVersus should we warn the chat if the trippy effects start?
[0:30:22] <leith_aziz> cohhO
[0:31:13] <Arqartur0> every time this game loads there should be warnings
[0:31:13] <gamefan6219> @WoolieVersus like the gnome boss?
[0:31:27] <CoffeeCobra> I'd say general caution is advised but those of us who beat it can warn chat ahead of time
[0:31:29] <Arqartur0> or ways to mod it
[0:31:57] <ZeeJiggle> Same, Gaster 3
[0:32:04] <Arqartur0> Oh wait, modding "dilutes the original vision"
[0:32:06] <+Shonen_hero> whoa what
[0:32:08] <%Indigo_Automaton> LUL
[0:32:10] <$tkuwari> cool

[1:19:32] <Futurecity10> cheer500 Yo woolie, wanted to know what you thought of this enemy concept. I play a game were there is this group called the Emperor's Blade and they look like like Hellgast from Killzone but with way cooler  masks.  And the concept is that they get their power by injecting a literal demon into their armor.  And if ever killed the resulting explosion is on the scale of a void out but worse cause it causes a literal void of nothingness on the land it dies on.

[1:46:41] <Speckster42> @Speckster42 just my opinion ofc any order is fine
[1:46:43] <dukenux> i mean, the authors themselves prolly knew they couldn't avoid them
[1:46:48] <%crybirb> @kingra, it doesn't, tons of games came before Undertale and did things Undertale popularized
[1:46:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:46:50] <Champstice> It does wear its inspiration on its sleeve
[1:46:52] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb the game is directly inspired by undertale, and goes out of its way to reference it
[1:46:56] <%legacy0117> The doors are made by Gaster likely.
[1:47:13] <slappini> the doors feel meta in terms of use, as we don't see anyone else use them
[1:47:24] <Yomamma1337> @slappini we see gold pig
[1:47:25] <SomeOtherNeb> the authors put in an ATM with Flowey's face on it in the first 20 minutes of the game, they knew what they were doing. That doesn't make the game an Undertale rip-off though
[1:47:26] <OkamiDude15> @crybirb undertale invented indie pixel rpgs much like how persona 5 invented jazz
[1:47:28] <%crybirb> @Yomamma1337, say one reference to Undertale this game has. Purely Undertale and not all other subversive rpgs
[1:47:29] <slappini> ah right
[1:47:34] <%crybirb> @OkamiDude15, Exactly
[1:47:44] <rommlll> i see only earthbound
[1:47:45] <%crybirb> @mr_sups, sadly
[1:47:46] <kingra> @crybirb The gaster ghosts?
[1:47:50] <%Indigo_Automaton> The grey door
[1:48:04] <%crybirb> @kingra, they are not gaster lol, they look like it, but besides that there's nothing from gaster in them.
[1:48:09] <Pookiedaexzile> There is a natural Conclusion, the big kill
[1:48:11] <slipdog> i would legit be fine with emote only mode forever
[1:48:12] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb atm is flowey, the whole killing choice thing, literally gaster, same font, repeated use of the word determination\
[1:48:13] <rommlll> this is like fourside lsd trip meets final stage meets twoson
[1:48:17] <nyacoo> @crybirb the flowey ATM?
[1:48:19] <zanzibarian_hamster> @kingra You could also argue that gaster ripped off Yumi niiki
[1:48:20] <slappini> they're moreso just ghost guys, like oby
[1:48:27] <rommlll> okay this is undertale lookin
[1:48:29] <%crybirb> @Yomamma1337, this is not Undertale exclusive my dude.
[1:48:31] <kingra> @crybirb Yeah they look alot like it. That's a reference
[1:48:33] <dukenux> then the lanterns and doors are yume nikki vibes
[1:48:35] <Pookiedaexzile> You have to choose progress
[1:48:39] <exnuart> the creator himself has said he was inspired by undertaile
[1:48:51] <%LastHazzerd> doesn't the Yumi Nikki game have an NPC that also resembles what Gaster looks like?
[1:48:56] <slappini> yes
[1:48:56] <OkamiDude15> they're both video games thus they are undertale
[1:49:01] <%crybirb> @LastHazzerd, yes.
[1:49:03] <BlackermanZX> people forget Uboa existed before gaster
[1:49:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I dont see whats wrong with it being inspired by undertale?
[1:49:08] <dukenux> and Earthbound being for these games what Doom is for FPS
[1:49:09] <%LastHazzerd> and that came first, right?
[1:49:11] <+toastybites> are people still arguing about whether this is a "rip-off"
[1:49:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I mean theyre both different games
[1:49:15] <slappini> they're both references to the same npc
[1:49:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Lmao
[1:49:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh no.... BibleThump
[1:49:17] <hiddenllama4> this song is a jam
[1:49:18] <%crybirb> This game is a game so it is references Doom.

[1:50:43] <rommlll> BRUH.
[1:50:47] <+Akizea> @crybirb I don't know why you have such an issue with undertale comparisons with this game. they absolutely knew what they were doing. comparisons are fight but people also just gotta remember this game is its own thing too
[1:50:49] <Champstice> Rasta Beast really said "IT'S ON *SIGHT*"
[1:50:55] <%Indigo_Automaton> I'm not your Buddy, Guy!
[1:50:59] <+Akizea> fine* not fight lol
[1:51:01] <%LastHazzerd> it's amazing how complex the addition of deflecting makes this

[1:51:38] <%crybirb> @Akizea, in my view comparing to Undertale demerits the game by itself, and it's not even close to Undertale. Both are subversive RPGs based on a culture that stands strong for years, that was born out of Mother and Yume Nikki.
[1:51:46] <%legacy0117> Deflect helps, and the shots you shot cancels out one enemy shot if you need it.
[1:51:48] <rommlll> sad bc no rasta beat
[1:51:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ohhh you lose your deflect if you get hit

[1:52:36] <+Akizea> @crybirb sure but to absolutely just neglect the fact that more of these games started happening because of undertales immense success is honestly a demerit to undertale too.
[1:52:39] <%crybirb> @Yomamma1337, a lot of people are mentioning in the chat since it started, I brought up it was annoying and answered whoever tagged me.

[1:54:30] <%crybirb> @Akizea, I never did it didn't help make it popular or a success. I'm annoyed as attributing it's own construction and creativity to Undertale and taking crumbes of mechanics or narrative and sticking Undertale as its merit.

[1:55:18] <%crybirb> @Akizea, one thing is saying Genshin looks like BOTW. Other thing is saying everything looks lik eBOTW just because has green. Same happens with Souls. "this is the DARK SOULS OF RPGS!", it's annoying.
[1:55:20] <+Akizea> @queequegtheater LUL
[1:55:25] <rommlll> drop your shield
[1:55:39] <%crybirb> @QueequegTheater, Undertale created the BOOMER SHOOTER genre.
[1:56:01] <+Akizea> @crybirb iunno I just think you're looking way too deep into small comparisons people are thinking tbh.
[1:56:03] <%crybirb> @QueequegTheater, Toby Fox single handledly created music. There wasn't such thing before him being born.
[1:56:16] <dukenux> yea you are too salty about it
[1:56:17] <Champstice> Can we at least all agree the title of this track being "WRATH OF GOD" goes hard
[1:56:20] <rommlll> let reggie on the control while you figure it out
[1:56:31] <Jaysky> This game reminds me of BOTW cause it has music. Also the way you absorb attacks is JUST like Dark Souls when you absorb souls. What a ripoff.
[1:56:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @champstice its called what? YOOOOOO
[1:56:36] <Pookiedaexzile> He's not your friend Woolie
[1:56:41] <Yomamma1337> remember you can still hit him so long as you dont kill him
[1:56:42] <%Shad0wTag> Wrath of God? God damn
[1:56:44] <QueequegTheater> D:
[1:56:46] <+Akizea> @champstice fucking EXCUSE ME?????
[1:56:47] <%crybirb> @Akizea, yeah, that is my entire point, these small without purpose callouts to Undertale are annoying. Just that, annoying, that was what my comment is about. Everyone who tagged me in here that wanted to rebute that. I'm ok with peopel saying annoying stuff, but it is annoying nonetheless.
[1:56:50] <%oneimportantthing> Didn't cr1tikal spend like 3 hours on one boss lol
[1:56:56] <dukenux> the devsv realized they wouldnt avoid UT comparisons so they put the references in front and forward. i think it was a smart move
[1:56:59] <stevenellis386> absorb the yellow walls to shield yourself against the pink walls during the intense part.
[1:57:02] <Yomamma1337> @oneimportantthing i spent like 4 on one a couple days ago
[1:57:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Remember you can Kill him he kinda deserves it
[1:57:05] <rommlll> sheesh
[1:57:09] <BlackermanZX> this one seems hard as fuck
[1:57:22] <rommlll> change difficulty this is meant for scripters
[1:57:25] <Yomamma1337> @BlackermanZX its a pretty big spike in difficulty since hes trying not to kill
[1:57:28] <%crybirb> @Pookiedaexzile, I think it's Woolie's favorite character, I don't think he wants to kill it.
[1:57:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> lowering the difficulty is also an option, no?
[1:57:34] <%Shad0wTag> Why does he deserve it?
[1:57:39] <taeko_ohnuki> this seems like it might take a while
[1:57:41] <+Akizea> @dukenux literally this. there's nothing wrong with having references and that's fine.
[1:57:48] <%crybirb> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_, His fighting game mentality will not let him do that lol

[1:58:35] <Yomamma1337> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ yeah and thatd make it easier lol
[1:58:40] <Champstice> @emptyantics Some of the mods for this are really cool
[1:58:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ oh, that's kinda brutal

[1:59:16] <Yomamma1337> woolie you keep dying when you move from the left lane
[1:59:21] <%crybirb> I think you can do it just by jumping and keeping the rythm.
[1:59:24] <%xeromage> rhythm games are a special kind of addictive frustration
[1:59:25] <kruckstull> So close
[1:59:27] <BlackermanZX> hes getting it slowly
[1:59:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes give into the rage
[1:59:31] <gamefan6219> This is hard
[1:59:35] <slipdog> this isnt even a rhythm game, i almost wish it was
[1:59:40] <rommlll> kirby on the back just vibing
[1:59:42] <slipdog> its like a dodge the rhythm game
[1:59:43] <Champstice> Shoutout to one of the devs for  knowing "okay, SOMEONE is gonna make a custom battle set to megalovegalo so it MIGHT AS WELL BE ME" btw
[1:59:44] <onLowRegister> if he starts using 2 and 4 he'll get it
[1:59:49] <onLowRegister> let's see the labbing
[1:59:55] <%crybirb> @slipdog, Yeah that was the bigges downer to me when I played it, I wanted it to be more rythm based.
[2:00:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering
[2:00:12] <+theoldone001> Pretty dank beat tho, hard to be mad when the beat strong
[2:00:14] <@Menitta> it's a reverse rhythm game
[2:00:31] <+Flarepulse> the Dark Souls of quirky, Earthbound-inspired indie RPGs
[2:00:31] <Seithri> yeah a lot of people thought it was going to be a rhythm game when it was just a dodge the beats deal
[2:00:33] <dukenux> you could've made it pure rhytm based
[2:00:39] <Yomamma1337> you gotta deflect the red
[2:00:40] <dukenux> but that would make it less special
[2:00:40] <%emptyantics> This is just a dragonforce song 2020Drop
[2:00:41] <%crybirb> I think it would be cool if the player was the one keeping or creating the rythm instead of the enemies.
[2:00:46] <BlackermanZX> that was a dirty red wall
[2:00:56] <rommlll> in all fairness, the music doesn't go along with the game
[2:00:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:00:59] <@Menitta> idk I think this is way more unique
[2:01:03] <dukenux> you could reverse it, so the gaps are the notes
[2:01:03] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb thats literally every other rhythm game in existence
[2:01:12] <%oneimportantthing> Woolie I think your focusing on absorbing keys is keeping you distracted
[2:01:14] <+theoldone001> I wish we could fight back with our own beat, rather than just avoid the beat. Like being able to equip different notes on attacks and stuff.
[2:01:16] <Seithri> honestly if they make a second game i hope they double down on the enemy interactivity and mechanics to make it more special
[2:01:20] <%crybirb> @Yomamma1337, not really ,all other games the rythm is inbued in the level. I mean the player creating the rythm.
[2:01:22] <Dave_VD> This looks like a Toby fox game
[2:01:43] <%espanishcanamurciana> This music is 🤟🤟🤟
[2:01:47] <%oneimportantthing> I want to see ConcernedApe do an LP of this game
[2:01:50] <Yomamma1337> you can deflect the red
[2:01:50] <+Breaknoon> brutal
[2:01:52] <illTemperedSeaBass> Just parry the big red one.
[2:01:52] <%xeromage> that 1 wall
[2:02:08] <%Lion_kun> Woolie is hitting that Sekiro level of focus
[2:02:11] <+theoldone001> It's the Wall BROTHER!
[2:02:22] <%holydeviant1> One thing I've noticed about the parry/catch, is that if you're in an inttense string (when Rasta here gets the FIRE, for examble) it can be a bad idea to catch one in the mess because you lose focus and rythm
[2:02:52] <rommlll> noooo... man...
[2:02:55] <taeko_ohnuki> so hard to react to the walls in the fast section
[2:03:05] <slipdog> you just gotta find your rhythm
[2:03:11] <onLowRegister> the adaptation though, he's going
[2:03:12] <kruckstull> Probably best to stick to one lane in that section
[2:03:22] <BlackermanZX> this game aint fuckin around
[2:03:29] <Yomamma1337> might as well just stay on the left and deflect the single red wall
[2:03:32] <+maria_luke> im feeling the second hand frustration
[2:03:38] <%holydeviant1> In that sense, it's probably easier to just get through the song rthan it is to catch and return and keep dodging
[2:03:44] <rommlll> LFG
[2:03:44] <+theoldone001> @kruckstull kinda hard cause they throw the random wall note to throw you off
[2:03:56] <+Mr_Pylon> this is a real one
[2:03:58] <rommlll> NotLikeThis
[2:04:05] <%crybirb> I think you can pass this by zigzagging and then jumping to the other side when you reach the wall
[2:04:08] <taeko_ohnuki> does reggie ever take the controls?
[2:04:19] <%crybirb> @taeko_ohnuki, he took only once in the first session.
[2:04:21] <a_bald_bro> the worst part is this isn't even when the game gets hard yet
[2:04:27] <+BigBruthaThunda> does it repeat until you kill him?
[2:04:32] <taeko_ohnuki> gotcha thanks for the reply
[2:04:36] <slipdog> reggie is the dark souls master
[2:04:37] <CoffeeCobra> @taeko_ohnuki he did last time with the incinerator but so far not really
[2:04:42] <onLowRegister> @a_bald_bro nah, this is for sure a hard part of it
[2:04:49] <rommlll> rip
[2:05:01] <Yomamma1337> moving right kills you
[2:05:06] <rommlll> do you know the definition of madness
[2:05:18] <+maria_luke> take 5 if you need to Woolie
[2:05:21] <%X2Eliah> Going Hollow
[2:05:24] <+theoldone001> Woolie is hollowing
[2:05:25] <Speckster42> no shame in lowering the difficulty here honestly
[2:05:27] <hiddenllama4> middle row is the sweet spot for when the flames appear
[2:05:35] <%legacy0117> Full charged shot seems to clear a full lane, except the wall shots.
[2:05:41] <%espanishcanamurciana> Oh wow what did I miss you can charge up and attack now?  Not just surviving the dance off?
[2:05:49] <+BigBruthaThunda> I went from hard to story mode once I got that damn arm
[2:05:51] <+projectmanatees> Remember when woolie  thought he’d have an easy time with this game LUL
[2:05:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can always switch to a picture of ?aiken to cool off a bit
[2:06:02] <%crybirb> he needs to blink lol
[2:06:03] <rommlll> GAME!1
[2:06:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:06:04] <SomeOtherNeb> TIME TO BLINK
[2:06:07] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:06:08] <Yomamma1337> woolie is not going to be ready for the hard fights lol

[2:06:56] <rommlll> NO

[2:09:58] <ocean_fran> oh thank god ur gonna play bloodborne psx
[2:10:06] <stevenellis386> breathe bruh breathe
[2:10:06] <Champstice> Chris Nordgren (one of the main devs) did make a LOT of tracks tho
[2:10:18] <rommlll> alirte ez no dmg
[2:10:23] <%crybirb> @Champstice, really impressive the quality they were able to put
[2:10:26] <Champstice> The bandcamp or steam ost release specifies who made what credits
[2:10:29] <SomeOtherNeb> still SourPls -ing tho
[2:10:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> At least this song goes hard as fuck
[2:10:42] <+projectmanatees> Salt must flow
[2:10:44] <%oneimportantthing> Is Chris Nordgren Swedish? He sounds swedish (i'm also a swede)
[2:10:51] <%legacy0117> woolieGLORY
[2:10:52] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @rommlll
[2:10:52] <Yomamma1337> you can deflect the yellow too
[2:10:54] <%Orcapugs> Need to upgrade internet connection
[2:10:57] <+swesterly> that riff sounds like Jolyne's theme
[2:11:00] <BlackermanZX> this fight is insane
[2:11:02] <Speckster42> @oneimportantthing ja
[2:11:09] <+Flarepulse> a lot of the second halves boss battles' songs are done by guest artists
[2:11:23] <%oneimportantthing> @speckster42 najs
[2:11:24] <rommlll> it's whatever
[2:11:32] <Dave_VD> Is this on switch? Looks tight
[2:11:33] <ocean_fran> ur doing good!
[2:11:46] <ocean_fran> @Dave_VD pc and switch
[2:11:47] <+Ricky_Rexx> not sure if I should pick up the game or just listen to the soundtrack for an uninterrupted experience
[2:11:47] <+Flarepulse> yea its on switch
[2:11:48] <%crybirb> Is this the hardest fight or there's something harder?
[2:11:51] <%oneimportantthing> The Genichiro of music games
[2:11:54] <%holydeviant1> it's been a hot minute since I saw woolie this intense
[2:12:03] <%livlinn> clearl19SoyShake
[2:12:05] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb a lot of later fights make this one look super easy
[2:12:11] <rommlll> he's got the eyes
[2:12:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Somewhere Diago is smiling
[2:12:23] <ocean_fran> there are superbosses
[2:12:27] <%crybirb> @Yomamma1337, there is still alot of game to go? I thought it was close to the end
[2:12:29] <rommlll> put on some shades and walk it out
[2:12:30] <Champstice> @holydeviant1 His almonds have Activated
[2:12:31] <kruckstull> Yeah, it gets much harder from here on out
[2:12:32] <%emptyantics> It’s 7 min song right? It’s rough
[2:12:34] <nintega010> was daigo playing this?
[2:12:40] <Yomamma1337> @crybirb youd be surprised
[2:12:41] <+BigBruthaThunda> a wise man once said "The difficulty is very bad"
[2:12:58] <illTemperedSeaBass> You were off by a second. And a second is a lifetime in dance-battle.
[2:13:12] <rommlll> how long is this song?
[2:13:12] <ElBuraindo> it feels... counterintuitive
[2:13:19] <%crybirb> Quite surprise this was made in Unity, it feels game maker-ish, but most of the Shader effects I don't know if were possible in GM
[2:13:33] <Champstice> @rommlll 2 minutes 20 seconds
[2:13:33] <%oneimportantthing> Is there a reason why Woolz isn't playing this on normal
[2:13:43] <Yomamma1337> you can parry the bananas
[2:13:44] <rommlll> @rommlll thx
[2:13:44] <taeko_ohnuki> rough slow down
[2:13:50] <%emptyantics> @oneimportantthing He knows he can do it on Hard
[2:13:51] <%IGgy_IGsen> They really want you to give in to murder.
[2:14:18] <BlackermanZX> fighting the urge to kill this mf
[2:14:33] <rommlll> wall
[2:14:41] <%oneimportantthing> @emptyantics I shall channel the power of friendship and urge chat to do the same
[2:14:42] <Lisonfire> this fight is even harder if your trying to kill him
[2:14:47] <%xeromage> The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides
[2:14:55] <%crybirb> It must be pretty easy to kill him seeing how many parriable notes there are
[2:15:08] <%legacy0117> Some folks just want to watch the worlds burn.
[2:15:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:10] <+projectmanatees> He chose this CBT he has to deal with the cage LUL

[2:16:37] <rommlll> new tech!
[2:16:39] <%oneimportantthing> @x2eliah or Story mode
[2:16:42] <Champstice> *still ain't
[2:16:43] <CoffeeCobra> to be honest here, if they plan on a pacifist run he has to learn to get trough this because it's only gonna get worse from here LUL
[2:16:45] <Pookiedaexzile> @X2Eliah When Woolies name starts in B
[2:17:00] <%espanishcanamurciana> 🔥🔥🔥
[2:17:03] <Champstice> @CoffeeCobra At least pacifist is (technically) short
[2:17:15] <%crybirb> @CoffeeCobra, in this game the pacifist run is the hardest?
[2:17:15] <%emptyantics> @coffeecobra I just remembered the hardest one has yet to come NotLikeThis
[2:17:18] <%oneimportantthing> @coffeecobra As a pacifist runner myself you are so unbelievably right
[2:17:19] <%IGgy_IGsen> This is so intense I'm getting a little sweaty just watching.
[2:17:19] <nintega010> speed changes get you in a lot of things
[2:17:32] <Champstice> Brave of the devs to have that route end with a sign saying "aha ligma"
[2:17:53] <CoffeeCobra> I love how so many people just got PTSD flashbacks to this game's pacifist boss LUL
[2:17:56] <legallyblindgamer727> Did he get the arm?

[2:22:42] <%legacy0117> He lives in a tree and has a toilet. That is just a crappy situation for everyone else.

[2:23:01] <dukenux> why isnt it always on?
[2:23:11] <Yomamma1337> @dukenux because most people arent colorblind
[2:23:22] <rommlll> look at that yu gi oh card trap mage
[2:23:28] <+Jiggisnipe> monkaS
[2:23:29] <FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah i usually turn color blind on everything, even though im not. Helps the contrast
[2:23:38] <dukenux> @Yomamma1337 but the game tells you to turn it on anyway
[2:23:42] <%crybirb> The mages design are really cool, makes me think of Shovel Knight for some reason.

[2:30:50] <LunarRemix> I'd say it's *the* hardest
[2:30:51] <Yomamma1337> @emptyantics yeah but the hard part is killing him since hes got so much health
[2:30:55] <SomeOtherNeb> SourPls
[2:31:02] <%crybirb> @LunarRemix, this is the hardest battle the game offers?
[2:31:03] <%oneimportantthing> Is there a reason this game didn't become more popular? Like did people dismiss it as an undertale knockoff and mot give it a chance?
[2:31:06] <exnuart> why oh you are love
[2:31:11] <+HappyWulf> turn off color blind mode
[2:31:18] <Yomamma1337> you can jump it if you jump and move at the same time
[2:31:20] <PKSomething> Considering this is an optional boss, yeah, this is meant to test you
[2:31:25] <Champstice> @oneimportantthing Probably partly that
[2:31:31] <%legacy0117> woolieSHOOKREG We in the big leagues now.
[2:31:32] <%crybirb> @oneimportantthing, it's really hard, the only thing I can think. I like hard games but this one threw me for a loop at the start.
[2:31:34] <dukenux> @oneimportantthing maybe? i just didn't see anyone really mentioning it until recently
[2:31:37] <+Akizea> @oneimportantthing it's overwhelmingly positive on steam. this game got plenty popular but just not like undertale huge
[2:31:41] <+Pixel_Matt> color blind mode
[2:31:41] <LunarRemix> @crybirb Pretty much. He's doing it pacifist so it's a little bit easier but if he was trying to kill him he'd have to parry and shoot almost every single available note.
[2:31:42] <Champstice> Other being: Man Games Keep Coming Out Huh
[2:31:51] <Arqartur0> BTW, the song is called Why Oh You Are LOVE Ambient V-X
[2:31:51] <Yomamma1337> its okay to back down
[2:31:58] <gan_n_dorf> lgioGoldThrust lgioGoldThrust lgioGoldThrust
[2:32:06] <%crybirb> @LunarRemix, Ohhh, can you repeat the battle after it finishes or only one try?
[2:32:07] <BlackermanZX> oh its getting real as hell
[2:32:12] <PKSomething> I only heard about this game from a streamer who streams niche stuff
[2:32:16] <Arqartur0> No Back Down, Woolie!
[2:32:18] <Yomamma1337> no its not, killing hims the hard part
[2:32:21] <%espanishcanamurciana> >the final boss woolieMINHMAX .  >the optional boss woolieGASM
[2:32:22] <%RemedyofRevenge> can you through the magic at the wall notes?
[2:32:26] <%emptyantics> It turned real once you picked up your arm
[2:32:26] <Yomamma1337> he has ungodly amounts of hp
[2:32:28] <PKSomething> He thinks it'd be easy to kill this LUL
[2:32:32] <BluBox> Y O U R L O V E
[2:32:33] <$Spydurman> killing him is insanely tough
[2:32:35] <dukenux> would it? seems to me like timing the attacks only adds complication
[2:32:36] <+HappyWulf> @crybirb you can retry later
[2:32:37] <%oneimportantthing> Yo Woolie you're allowed to change difficulty lmao
[2:32:39] <Jaysky> Yomama is right you can leave like a coward
[2:32:40] <LunarRemix> @crybirb Uh only one try. So if he doesn't kill this guy he's gone forever. That's not necessary for any of the endings though, he's completely optional.
[2:32:41] <Speckster42> killing is so much harder lol
[2:32:43] <Yomamma1337> its easier to not kill this guy
[2:32:47] <+Flarepulse> This is the start of the Superboss gauntlet, and is one of the biggest difficulty hike in the game
[2:32:48] <Jaysky> Incorrect
[2:32:53] <%crybirb> @LunarRemix, interesting, thanks for the answer
[2:32:53] <Mr_Rakjo> Incorrect
[2:32:59] <Lisonfire> killing is harder on most of the hard bosses
[2:33:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Killing is hard, and more gratifying
[2:33:18] <SomeOtherNeb> @LunarRemix nah I think you can have him respawn at the theater if you don't kill him, but it's a random chance
[2:33:18] <+HappyWulf> @lunarremix False. He appears in the theater later
[2:33:30] <BlackermanZX> is colorblind messing with the timing
[2:33:30] <gan_n_dorf> lgioGoldThrust lgioGoldThrust lgioGoldThrust lgioGoldThrust
[2:33:36] <Yomamma1337> woolie just back down
[2:33:36] <%emptyantics> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:33:37] <dukenux> look at this wall of sound
[2:33:39] <%oneimportantthing> Eeey
[2:33:41] <%espanishcanamurciana> So you beat them by Royal guarding them?
[2:33:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Turn off Color blind mode
[2:33:47] <exnuart> colorblind mode might be fucking you up
[2:33:55] <Champstice> @BlackermanZX the gaps aren't as visible, yeah
[2:34:16] <%oneimportantthing> So is this really optional?
[2:34:22] <+HappyWulf> yup
[2:34:35] <%Indigo_Automaton> @oneimportantthing Yeah completely. This isn't necessary for pacifist ending at all
[2:34:38] <Lisonfire> light guy is entirely optioinal yeah
[2:34:40] <Pookiedaexzile> "I usta know this purple love, why are you off every day"
[2:34:44] <Yomamma1337> woolie hes a super boss
[2:34:49] <exnuart> colorblind mode hides the spaces
[2:34:52] <%oneimportantthing> Lol so it's the Nameless King of this game
[2:34:59] <+HappyWulf> it leads to a series of other optional "weapon" optional bosses
[2:35:02] <PKSomething> This is an optional superboss. If you wanna come back to this later, by all means
[2:35:02] <%legacy0117> You can, but deflect isn’t just a hold down the block button. Gotta time it.
[2:35:03] <Jaysky> Super boss on hard mode is hard as it turns out
[2:35:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah
[2:35:07] <Lisonfire> theres a couple superbosses
[2:35:10] <%emptyantics> He’s an optional superboss so its ok to backdown
[2:35:10] <SomeOtherNeb> good call
[2:35:17] <Yomamma1337> @oneimportantthing he leads into a harder boss
[2:35:22] <%crybirb> Colorblind mode looked easier to me
[2:35:32] <Yomamma1337> colorblind is for people with colorblindness
[2:35:33] <%holydeviant1> I step away for FIVE MINUTES AND WHAT
[2:35:35] <%legacy0117> The extended notes really cover a lot of area.
[2:35:39] <nyacoo> he said that in case you were coming to kill him
[2:35:47] <Ramasama13> @holydeviant1 optional super boss
[2:35:53] <%oneimportantthing> Oh WOW does this seem easier without accessible mode
[2:35:59] <+HappyWulf> yup
[2:36:01] <exnuart> progress
[2:36:08] <SomeOtherNeb> colorblind mode makes it look like the bullets are twice as long
[2:36:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie started w weighted clothing

[2:36:22] <Lisonfire> this is optional in all ending yeah
[2:36:22] <%emptyantics> Yes
[2:36:24] <Seithri> this is optional boss 3 if you count the incinerator
[2:36:29] <+PendragonVT> its helpful mainly for killing if you can't tell apart the colors, if you're just dodging its less so
[2:36:30] <BlackermanZX> boy this game has some bangers
[2:36:33] <DelEeriest> heya chat, so what's the story about this game?

[2:37:04] <Champstice> @DelEeriest Red Geno got his arm nicked
[2:37:33] <%oneimportantthing> Good thing the music slaps because it makes it way easier to spend ages beating each of these
[2:37:35] <DelEeriest> The same Geno from Mario RPG? damn... poor guy must've fell on hard times
[2:37:41] <Yomamma1337> this is painful
[2:37:52] <baphometseinfeld> It's like trying to get through Jordan in Guitar Hero 2, you gotta reach the safe zones

[2:39:26] <%oneimportantthing> This looks like a David Cage Beyond Two Souls entity lmao
[2:39:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Walls Are Food
[2:39:44] <HotSauceFiend> lower the difficulty to increase your health. but try to kill this thing
[2:39:50] <Finchit> i dont understand why people wanted geno in smash. mallow was waaaaay better
[2:39:56] <jimgimp> David Cage's Final Form
[2:40:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Why jump when Wall
[2:40:12] <SuperChumps> hey, this isn't friday night funkin.
[2:40:17] <Yomamma1337> you really should come back later for this guy
[2:40:21] <+HappyWulf> This is a long song. he's not even gotten through 20% of it. He could be here for hours like this if he's not more aggressive with attacks.
[2:40:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Parry Wall
[2:40:39] <hiddenllama4> should try the shopkeeper fight instead
[2:40:39] <HotSauceFiend> woolie has to be way more aggressive
[2:40:41] <onLowRegister> this song is just among the hardest in game
[2:40:52] <HotSauceFiend> hes not a superboss.
[2:41:00] <+HappyWulf> you can Attack a Wall to kill the wall, but not do damage. walls block attacks.
[2:41:00] <%oneimportantthing> @jimgimp Cage: "oh you fuckers say dying isn't a failure of the game designer? watch THIS
[2:41:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Parry Wall
[2:41:19] <+Mr_Pylon> getting slicker with the side steps
[2:41:23] <Saltmeisterr> wtf did i come back too
[2:41:24] <EL_TRO> he's jaaaaammiing
[2:41:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Parry Wall Please
[2:41:29] <taeko_ohnuki> can you jump and parry the thing you land on?
[2:41:30] <nintega010> @HappyWulf thats helpful to know
[2:41:38] <Mr_Rakjo> why are you even doing the pacifist run
[2:41:39] <DelEeriest> So, what does the absorbing mechanic do? Woolie was able to shoot back a few times, but on accident?
[2:41:40] <%townzzzzz> let the hate grow
[2:41:53] <jimgimp> @oneimportantthing He acquires all of the chaos emeralds
[2:41:57] <Seithri> this ain't no undertale, work for your pacifism
[2:42:02] <chambatron> name of the song?
[2:42:03] <AppleBerryKitty> lytJIVE lytJIVE pandoraSing pandoraSing
[2:42:04] <HotSauceFiend> wait i just hopped in, hes doing this on pacifist run?
[2:42:05] <+HappyWulf> @deleeriest he's trying to pacifist
[2:42:06] <Yomamma1337> dont be afraid of hurting him, its almost impossible to kill him unless you optimize your damage
[2:42:08] <%Indigo_Automaton> This boss is required for one of the endings that isn't pacifist. For pacifist he's completely optional
[2:42:13] <%oneimportantthing> @jimgimp "I made ze bas chaos control"
[2:42:16] <exnuart> @chambatron why are you are love.

[2:42:49] <BlackermanZX> i guess you don't have to pull your punches on this one
[2:42:51] <%legacy0117> Because in this game pacifism is way harder to accomplish.
[2:42:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Why Jump Wall
[2:43:06] <HotSauceFiend> pacifist means no killing, doesnt mean you cant deflect his attacks
[2:43:06] <slipdog> not a superboss! this is appropriate
[2:43:10] <%oneimportantthing> I really wanna see Pat take a shot at this
[2:43:26] <Yomamma1337> @slipdog well its a mini-superboss, so close enough

[2:44:44] <taeko_ohnuki> so close
[2:44:44] <onLowRegister> woolie is getting clean cartwheel jumps though

[2:44:54] <exnuart> you were nearly done too
[2:44:58] <%legacy0117> Actually if you just leave the arm, it’s a choice too.
[2:45:01] <big_oki> awwwww
[2:45:06] <%Tearonex> damn woolie was in the zone
[2:45:07] <%oneimportantthing> That was CLOSE

[2:46:45] <%oneimportantthing> Don't worry we all love a good struggle arc, i for one am digging the progress
[2:47:10] <%emptyantics> I don’t mind cause this song slaps woolieCHAN
[2:47:10] <Seithri> if there was no struggle, these fights would lose their edge
[2:47:14] <%legacy0117> Woolie is a pro fighter game fella, he’s got the reflexes for this sorta thing. ^^
[2:47:30] <slipdog> i just felt like the game needed like one more mechanic idk
[2:47:31] <haitakaa> holy shit that's a big health bar
[2:47:57] <nyacoo> aww
[2:48:00] <%xeromage> that felt very close
[2:48:01] <Champstice> oh no
[2:48:05] <+deltachief47> HES DOING IT
[2:48:06] <%oneimportantthing> Ooooofff
[2:48:21] <@Menitta> the lightning in the back makes me think of that Patrick Bury the Light gif LUL
[2:48:21] <HotSauceFiend> if anything, this boss teaches you to be aggressive with deflecting
[2:48:24] <%oneimportantthing> That was like 15 seconds from victory
[2:48:25] <%crybirb> How many minutes it's this battle?
[2:48:26] <Yomamma1337> the song was close to ending at least
[2:48:28] <+HumanDoctor> 7 min song
[2:48:29] <slipdog> winnable
[2:48:36] <exnuart> the song is 2 and half minutes
[2:48:36] <+HappyWulf> that was about 60%
[2:48:37] <%HeroToxiko> roses are red chocolate is delectable....
[2:48:39] <%emptyantics> 7 min song
[2:48:43] <%oneimportantthing> @humandoctor no way really?
[2:48:51] <Champstice> 2min 40 seconds
[2:48:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Its a 20 minute Mega mix
[2:48:56] <%crybirb> Oh now I can see why it's hard to kill him
[2:49:03] <dromemer3> jetpac14JAM jetpac14JAM jetpac14JAM jetpac14JAM
[2:49:04] <exnuart> 2:39
[2:49:07] <%oneimportantthing> It's a Hits 4 Kidz CD length
[2:49:13] <nyacoo> 2:20
[2:49:23] <HotSauceFiend> its harder to do this without killing him honestly. deflecting gives you options
[2:49:38] <Champstice> In any case it's definitely prolonged attrition with the amount of projectiles the guy is firing off
[2:49:40] <%X2Eliah> pain
[2:49:46] <Yomamma1337> @HotSauceFiend completely untrue, you deflect without killing him
[2:49:46] <%crybirb> @HotSauceFiend, everyone said it's harder to kill him because he has tons of life.
[2:49:58] <Yomamma1337> @HotSauceFiend you can*
[2:50:07] <+silvery_cricket> Man this seems difficult to the point of not being fun, why would a developer design this
[2:50:10] <exnuart> you're likely to end the fight with needing 1 hit left on him it seems
[2:50:21] <BlackermanZX> the shit geno has to do so he can be in smash
[2:50:23] <exnuart> so going aggro is probably fine
[2:50:26] <%crybirb> @silvery_cricket, disagree, it's about learning, it feels like Woolie is learning, also winning this must feels good as shit
[2:50:27] <Yomamma1337> @silvery_cricket its an optional super boss.  thats how they work
[2:50:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:50:35] <+HappyWulf> when you're TRYING to kill him, it's a dps race that is hard to do and keep up.
[2:50:46] <HotSauceFiend> Maybe Im speaking from personal experience. i found this much harder to dodge fully rather than dflect attack
[2:50:51] <exnuart> big health low time
[2:50:55] <+silvery_cricket> @Yomamma1337 Oh its optional, that explains why its miserable
[2:50:56] <exnuart> get to chipping
[2:51:10] <Yomamma1337> @HotSauceFiend yeah, but theres no reason not to deflect him, its not like youre gonna kill him
[2:51:10] <%oneimportantthing> Woolie is too close to quit now
[2:51:16] <+Jiggisnipe> sajamVibe sajamVibe sajamSploinky sajamSploinky sajamVibe sajamVibe sajamSploinky sajamSploinky

[2:52:07] <%oneimportantthing> Or story mode LUL
[2:52:11] <HotSauceFiend> @yomamma1337 exactly. even in this pacifist run, id be deflecting much more. woolie is minimizing deflects, which to me seems harder

[2:52:49] <%crybirb> @Pookiedaexzile, yeah, dunno why, I want to see him beat this so much.
[2:52:55] <%livlinn> forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry
[2:52:57] <+HappyWulf> yeah, he's confusing pacifist with zero damage
[2:53:11] <hit2key> I really like the verse sections of the fight but the lightning is slightly too much
[2:53:11] <%crybirb> Chat would hate to see Max on his Boss Battles lol
[2:53:14] <nyacoo> no?
[2:53:16] <Pookiedaexzile> YOu can Shoot without killing him
[2:53:20] <%Indigo_Automaton> They do
[2:53:21] <%oneimportantthing> He can do significant damage without a kill
[2:53:23] <SomeOtherNeb> it clears one bullet, I believe
[2:53:27] <SaintBeau> it does
[2:53:28] <%emptyantics> You got this woolie
[2:53:28] <Yomamma1337> it clears 1 wall or 2 nonwall shols
[2:53:28] <+HappyWulf> A bullet clears 2 projectiles
[2:53:33] <Seithri> it clears 2 bullets and 1 wall
[2:53:34] <zedravan> test it
[2:53:36] <%Indigo_Automaton> The projectiles clears a few but not the whole lane
[2:53:43] <triangularblasphemy> Y O U R
[2:53:45] <triangularblasphemy> L O V E
[2:53:51] <HotSauceFiend> remember pacifism means beating something until you ALMOST kill them lol
[2:54:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Its how you get thru the rainbow section with no damage
[2:54:02] <HotSauceFiend> just no killing
[2:54:09] <nyacoo> You also lose the charge if you get hit
[2:54:20] <%espanishcanamurciana> This is so refreshing
[2:54:27] <dromemer3> that footwork though
[2:54:44] <hit2key> that foot tapping is etched into my memory
[2:54:47] <BlackermanZX> its not killing if you beat them half to death wooliePOYO
[2:54:48] <+HappyWulf> there a slight timing issue of you shoot at the sane time as you get hit, you'll shoot through the wall.
[2:54:52] <HotSauceFiend> that rainbow section requires some deflecting I remember. some of the bullet patterns trap you in you keep lane changing only
[2:55:03] <%oneimportantthing> It's weird how the guitar hero/rock band genre just died completely aside from this game
[2:55:04] <dromemer3> Guess he's a super boss for a reason
[2:55:18] <BlackermanZX> i wonder if you could play this on a dance pad
[2:55:19] <%crybirb> Impossible to jump that rainbow fully, it's 3 in sequence
[2:55:21] <Yomamma1337> the red appears on the beat

[2:56:26] <%crybirb> I wonder if REZ songs would work in a game like this
[2:56:28] <HotSauceFiend> It IS a hard fight, thankfully its not throwing visual hallucinogenic bs at you
[2:56:53] <Seithri> god imagine if the screen was rocking with this

[3:00:12] <%oneimportantthing> There is no reason to back down now, you got this
[3:00:22] <legallyblindgamer727> Could he not score hits in between those pauses?
[3:00:35] <Yomamma1337> @oneimportantthing theres also no reason to continue atm
[3:00:38] <HotSauceFiend> staying in one lane is hard because you can only deflect so much. its not like deflecting is instananeous
[3:00:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Why Sidestep, when you can eat
[3:01:03] <HotSauceFiend> @yomamma1337 i mean you are right, but hes here now so no stopping this train
[3:01:04] <%oneimportantthing> @yomamma1337 The glory tho
[3:01:19] <Yomamma1337> @HotSauceFiend not in this fight, he only has to deflect once like every 10 seconds.  in other fights though you stick to 2
[3:01:42] <+swymbiote> you can get to this fight before you retrieve your arm, which i did without knowing what i was getting myself into
[3:01:46] <+swymbiote> that was... a fun few hours
[3:01:48] <Pookiedaexzile> You sure about that big man
[3:01:52] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Yup stop memorizing, just clear your head and dodge
[3:01:56] <%oneimportantthing> Woolie take 5 mins, you're getting frustrated, this is becoming Smelter Demon
[3:02:02] <HotSauceFiend> thats kinda why I love this fight. its forcing you to either be agrrssive deflecter or a fantastoc dodger
[3:02:13] <Yomamma1337> @oneimportantthing he was super close to winning
[3:02:16] <BlackermanZX> electro mf is going down
[3:02:22] <+swymbiote> other fights in this game are visual trips but this is 100% mechanics
[3:02:31] <+swymbiote> i appreciate it as a raw skill test
[3:02:56] <%oneimportantthing> @yomamma1337 Yeah but he's starting to die earlier now cuz he's trying so hard to memorise instead of just dodging
[3:03:20] <%oneimportantthing> A 5 minute break could help

[3:29:41] <AppleBerryKitty> @Jiggisnipe is that solbadguy??
[3:29:44] <+Flarepulse> agreeing to battle was the trap
[3:29:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Death is natural thing woolie
[3:29:52] <slipdog> sajamSol sajamSol sajamSol
[3:29:52] <+Jiggisnipe> @AppleBerryKitty yes lol
[3:29:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> He's a tree, his endurance is infinite
[3:29:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Let it happen
[3:29:58] <hit2key> at the very least this song slaps

[3:30:09] <%xeromage> endless practice
[3:30:10] <Uncle_Christian> and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
[3:30:29] <AppleBerryKitty> why sajam why
[3:30:57] <Pookiedaexzile> The mushrooms will think youre a bitch for not killing
[3:31:05] <hit2key> when you see “do you want an awesome fight” of course you’re going to say yes
[3:31:05] <Pookiedaexzile> This is kinda hellish
[3:31:13] <Yomamma1337> "kill yourself"
[3:31:29] <dukenux> LTG enters the chat
[3:31:30] <hit2key> I will say this is driving the themes of this game home pretty hard
[3:31:42] <SomeOtherNeb> everyone is mad at you for not doing the mass murder
[3:31:51] <+swymbiote> this game is not subtle with its themes the further you go
[3:32:15] <nyacoo> pls
[3:32:17] <dukenux> this is basicly euthanasia dilemma
[3:32:20] <%BinaryFireball> live forever in pain
[3:32:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I like how it goes dark like it fades out the forest
[3:32:28] <%BinaryFireball> I remember herb the tree from fallout 3
[3:32:29] <@Menitta> "I'm gonna pay you $100 to let me die"
[3:32:30] <puluxor> Being a pacifist means you refuse to use force, even to save someone else
[3:32:31] <Treasure_Vault> big sh2 energy
[3:32:37] <dukenux> except in here natural death isn't an option
[3:32:48] <AppleBerryKitty> tbh only thing the game is catching me on its the art style particle effects  (looks round)

[4:16:39] <kingra> @WoolieVersus Do you want to do a pacifist run?
[4:16:40] <$ArCielArDor> it's beautiful but you should do it off camera
[4:16:40] <Yomamma1337> there are obstacles in the way you  cant hold right
[4:16:41] <cancerknight97> a game over
[4:16:42] <rasamune> Let’s fucking stoooooooooooooooop
[4:16:44] <AngryAsian5> Bruh
[4:16:44] <BreakfastSampler> secret ending but it legit takes more than 2 hours
[4:16:48] <dukenux> You can't?
[4:16:51] <%HeroToxiko> is there a moon femboy at the end?
[4:16:52] <+S3xGAZEBO> Worse than that... it makes you interact so you can't just hold down the button.
[4:16:53] <hiddenllama4> there's obstacles about 3/4th of the way through
[4:16:55] <Mr_Rakjo> No
[4:16:57] <Yomamma1337> yes
[4:16:58] <PKSomething> No

[4:17:02] <Mr_Rakjo> Yes some obstacles
[4:17:02] <$ArCielArDor> yes
[4:17:02] <PKSomething> It's a corridor

[4:17:03] <nyacoo> Nah

[4:17:08] <+Lazy_2> desert bus

[4:17:09] <zzNamttamzz> Straight corridor with rubble
[4:17:10] <funnyfunnykid> a sign or 2
[4:17:11] <BluBox> Obstacles yeah
[4:17:11] <+notgoodatnamessorry> there's also some funny notes green mage left for himself, but besides that and the ending no
[4:17:11] <+agumon9000> Yes but its seperated by like 100 rooms at a time
[4:17:12] <+TheOlMitcheroo> rocks
[4:17:12] <%holydeviant1> maybe, I don't know~
[4:17:13] <+Rygaklu> rocks to go around
[4:17:13] <+S3xGAZEBO> nope
[4:17:14] <SomeOtherNeb> yes, for the last 50/100 rooms
[4:17:14] <+Flarepulse> just boulders around the 3 hour mark
[4:17:17] <+vieirat47> there is a keyboard macro that exists if you wanted to scam it
[4:17:17] <velgaduere> you're forced to navigate it
[4:17:18] <$ArCielArDor> and it's cool
[4:17:19] <Darkdrill> LUL
[4:17:19] <%crybirb> It's worse than LISA then
[4:17:25] <+chaosjoey> it sends a message
[4:17:25] <%atlasdotwav> There’s courage
[4:17:25] <GHouseduivel> Just a casual 4 hours
[4:17:26] <%Explodincatz> g a m e p l a y
[4:17:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> cool
[4:17:31] <+swymbiote> it's a test of endurance
[4:17:32] <SomeOtherNeb> the wiki even has a macro so you can dodge it all LUL
[4:17:37] <+PMAvers> For the content?
[4:17:41] <+theoldone001> Do it coward
[4:17:43] <BreakfastSampler> "let's see what actual bullshit they'll do"
[4:17:50] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Eternity
[4:17:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Its a fun concept
[4:17:55] <%atlasdotwav> I wouldn’t do it, but I’m a coward
[4:17:55] <+TheOlMitcheroo> 12 hour stream LETS GO
[4:17:58] <zzNamttamzz> Think how many years he's been tracking though NotLikeThis
[4:18:00] <+S3xGAZEBO> The wiki has a macro to do it for you...
[4:18:01] <+Flarepulse> player completion CBT
[4:18:01] <@Menitta> based tbh
[4:18:02] <Darkdrill> fuck you 100% speed run
[4:18:03] <SomeOtherNeb> yes
[4:18:04] <nyacoo> "And they'll do it anyway"
[4:18:05] <ordnavi> isn't there a chest
[4:18:06] <+swymbiote> yes
[4:18:07] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[4:18:09] <zedravan> maybe
[4:18:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[4:18:15] <%crybirb> I remember I got that one achievement for Stanley Parable and I asked myself for years "why I did that?"
[4:18:22] <LoneFonte> holy shit there's just a full macro there LUL
[4:18:23] <+swymbiote> you have to do the entire incinerator without being hit once for an achievmeent
[4:18:26] <+machinetoys> so just one sbpc play
[4:18:31] <@Menitta> oh I REMEMBER THIS
[4:18:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I have one of those
[4:18:57] <Champstice> I remember Anodyne 1 did a similar thing
[4:19:01] <CoffeeCobra> Woolie someone did the math on the tally stripes on the wall
[4:19:08] <gamefan6219> @WoolieVersus still playing everhood?
[4:19:09] <%crybirb> Yeah, Stanley Parable did that too.
[4:19:17] <Pookiedaexzile> It was a statement, here's another statement "Fuck that shit"
[4:19:18] <GHouseduivel> Oh no
[4:19:19] <Daxalog> But that deffers from person to perosn.
[4:19:19] <Yomamma1337> @CoffeeCobra how much?  i guessed very roughly 2 million
[4:19:21] <+swymbiote> @gamefan6219 no the game on stream and the category are lies
[4:19:32] <FrostedZaibatsu> Instead of putting it in a game, write a fucking book
[4:19:33] <%crybirb> And then Taro Yoko came and "HEY WANT TO BUY THE ACHIEVEMENTS?"
[4:19:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> How good is the Last Airbender 360 game REALLY?
[4:19:56] <slipdog> Literally getting farmed for ps+ / xbox gold time
[4:19:59] <+mace210> cheevo number go BRRRRR
[4:20:00] <gamefan6219> @swymbiote Right........ protonUgh
[4:20:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> NotLikeThis
[4:20:03] <%atlasdotwav> This is actually an important convo fr
[4:20:04] <ordnavi> but achievements make me feel good
[4:20:04] <CoffeeCobra> The Green Mage has counted 1 114 537 years before they went mad and stopped counting @WoolieVersus
[4:20:05] <%emptyantics> @crybirb Wait which game?!
[4:20:06] <slipdog> addictive psychology patents
[4:20:08] <+S3xGAZEBO> Mihn makes his won challenges to fulfill that itch even if the game doesn't have that.
[4:20:09] <KingOfTheGeats> sounds like a miserable experience
[4:20:11] <%crybirb> @emptyantics, Automata.
[4:20:13] <BlackermanZX> that sounds kinda miserable LUL
[4:20:17] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I like completing but that's too fucking much
[4:20:18] <slipdog> predatory
[4:20:22] <%crybirb> @emptyantics, Automata has an Achievement NPC with his head on it.
[4:20:25] <+theoldone001> Woolie's eternity is just one full hallway backdown
[4:20:30] <gamefan6219> @WoolieVersus same with balan wonderworld. a horrible game
[4:20:30] <+TheOlMitcheroo> If I stop having fun fuck 100%
[4:20:37] <Daxalog> Didnt the same thing happen on steam
[4:20:49] <AppleBerryKitty> "stanley parable baby game"
[4:20:52] <GHouseduivel> If getting them is fun, I'll achievement hunt, if I have to suffer for it, fuck that
[4:20:53] <CoffeeCobra> Balan Wonderworld was alright it just lacked
[4:20:56] <hit2key> I think Undertale does it well by simply not having unlockable achievements.
[4:21:14] <gamefan6219> @CoffeeCobra but it wasn't a fun game, and it was the worst game of 2021+
[4:21:15] <CoffeeCobra> but it wasn't broken or anything people were just piss mad like spoiled babies and behaved super immature about the sin of 'being bored'
[4:21:23] <Kalmana> I did the hallway. was "fun" did shiny hunting in pokemon while doing it lol
[4:21:23] <nyacoo> well it could also simply be the videogame version of a shitpost
[4:21:26] <@Menitta> they made all these assets, the player is going to see it
[4:21:33] <+S3xGAZEBO> they might have just thought it was funny... nothing deeper than that.
[4:21:42] <slipdog> holy shit balan wonderworld has shills? rules of the internet ig
[4:21:44] <BreakfastSampler> @hit2key as well as it being impossible to have a 100% complete and 'good' save
[4:21:48] <%crybirb> Actually, not game design, they separated today. Who has that theory is MAINLY Product Managers/Designers, not Game Designers. Game Designers are just crazy today. I'm a game dev at Square.
[4:21:49] <nintega010> Do it off stream
[4:21:50] <+S3xGAZEBO> but I appreciate the thought put into it
[4:21:51] <+tempestzephyr> Flowy lit calls out chat for being too cowardly to play it themselves LUL
[4:21:58] <GHouseduivel> Waiting 5 mins sure fine, an hour? wtf dawg
[4:22:09] <velgaduere> @slipdog Yuji Naka loyalists, fooled into believing that he was ever strong enough to make his own games
[4:22:12] <CoffeeCobra> @gamefan6219 I'm not gonna debate you, but it has a fanbase and I'm in it and yes we're disappointed but it really didn't deserve fans getting asked if they were paid to like it :/
[4:22:14] <%HeroToxiko> types everhood hallway into youtube woolieLORE
[4:22:17] <%emptyantics> @crybirb When’s FFXVI coming
[4:22:18] <%crybirb> Game Designers come with sh!t like "YO WHAT IF WE PUT A SECRET MECHANIC IN THE CLOSE POPUP BUTTON?"
[4:22:21] <$ArCielArDor> it's an actual thing and it's really neat.
[4:22:36] <%crybirb> @emptyantics, I don't know, I'm on Canada Square hahahahah
[4:22:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Why
[4:22:40] <@Menitta> "what if it was a musical"
[4:22:44] <$ArCielArDor> you should do it off camera
[4:22:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Why go see brown
[4:22:50] <Yomamma1337> you already saw brown though?
[4:22:59] <gamefan6219> did you guys kill rasta?
[4:23:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:23:09] <+swymbiote> they've killed nobody
[4:23:09] <Pookiedaexzile> He's already here
[4:23:09] <%crybirb> @gamefan6219, no he is full pacifist
[4:23:10] <hit2key> the hallway is one of those mysteries I think I’m going to try to leave alone
[4:23:27] <gamefan6219> @crybirb oh.... so he spared him
[4:23:27] <dukenux> yep
[4:23:38] <cancerknight97> yeah...
[4:23:42] <CoffeeCobra> Woolie never got to see the years the Mage counted :(

[4:24:19] <+swymbiote> yes
[4:24:23] <kingra> I think they do
[4:24:24] <+swymbiote> not a screen but a sign
[4:24:24] <%pi_in_the_sci> yes, several
[4:24:25] <cancerknight97> absolutely
[4:24:25] <zzNamttamzz> There signs
[4:24:27] <Ramasama13> a sign
[4:24:32] <Kalmana> Theres several that says "stop going" basically
[4:24:33] <CoffeeCobra> Wools, someone did the math, they counted 1 114 537 years
[4:24:34] <funnyfunnykid> If you want to go through the corridor but not play through it, someone put the macros in the wiki so you can just sleep through it.
[4:24:38] <zedravan> signs start pleading you to go back

[4:31:10] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @gan_n_dorf
[4:31:11] <%crybirb> woolie forgot neutral jump
[4:31:18] <+swymbiote> @hassanico2 attacks in this fight are basically all for defending yourself - considering you need to do a run where you don't kill anyone to get here in the first place
[4:31:19] <lurkbait> Alright, start making bets in how long Woolie takes on Frog Sans
[4:31:30] <gan_n_dorf> Through the Ribbit and the Croak we kero on
[4:31:36] <%crybirb> @swymbiote, but can you kill him in this fight?
[4:31:38] <sporeian94> this seems like an insanely hard game
[4:31:40] <Tojan89> SourPls
[4:31:41] <%robosqueeb> This ones gonna take a rib-bit Kappa
[4:31:52] <hassanico2> @sporeian94 this is technically a finale
[4:32:01] <%Charronia> @sporeian94 You can make it easier if you want, this is Hard difficulty
[4:32:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Frogs using his Stand BucketHead
[4:32:02] <+swymbiote> @crybirb It skips to the end of the song with the same outcome, but I don't know if it's really keeping in spirit
[4:32:04] <cancerknight97> 👀
[4:32:08] <+swymbiote> @crybirb also it's very very difficult
[4:32:11] <zerointelligence000> I've only seen the beginning of this game so seeing Kermit become sephiroth is a bit jarring
[4:32:11] <CoffeeCobra> @sporeian94 the first half is decent and has a generous difficulty system
[4:32:12] <LoneFonte> also you can turn down difficulty
[4:32:25] <Yomamma1337> @sporeian94 heard a lot of people call this the hardest boss in the game.
[4:32:26] <nyacoo> @sporeian94 It does have 5 different difficulty settings, including a super easy story mode

[4:32:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Difficulty just changes hp regen tho
[4:32:50] <+swymbiote> this is definitely not the hardest overall but this is the hardest to no-hit i think
[4:32:51] <zerointelligence000> he's starting to believe
[4:32:52] <%xeromage> An AXE for every AXIS
[4:32:55] <SomeOtherNeb> SourPls
[4:32:59] <%SuckerPunchSyd> But idk about if anything changes with story mode
[4:33:03] <@Menitta> "he is the one"
[4:33:03] <+S3xGAZEBO> He moves like they do!
[4:33:04] <%philzy240> zyzxMerrysatsu
[4:33:06] <CoffeeCobra> this is the hardest boss, but the achievement for the Incinerator is considered the worst LUL
[4:33:08] <+swymbiote> @SuckerPunchSyd story mode changes the bullet patterns, yes
[4:33:09] <Ramasama13> blue guy really taught woolie a lot
[4:33:10] <SomeOtherNeb> ah, I figured out the pattern: whenever I post a SourPls Woolie dies
[4:33:11] <gamefan6219> @Yomamma1337 is this the full game, or a demo?
[4:33:14] <%IGgy_IGsen> Love when these harmonized guitars hit
[4:33:18] <exnuart> 4:12 song
[4:33:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @swymbiote nice nice good to know
[4:33:31] <+swymbiote> @SuckerPunchSyd it also cuts entire segments out of some songs
[4:33:42] <Uncle_Christian> OD on visuals
[4:33:43] <+swymbiote> so your reward for story mode is less bangers
[4:33:44] <SomeOtherNeb> man it does NOT give you any space

[4:34:51] <SomeOtherNeb> truly a failure of the game designer
[4:35:03] <+swymbiote> getting hit by attacks is a failure of the game designer

[4:35:53] <+swymbiote> hey calling someone david cage is slander

[4:36:14] <cancerknight97> WELCOM IN OMIKRON
[4:36:16] <SomeOtherNeb> nah, Cage literally said game overs are a failure of the game designer
[4:36:18] <Uncle_Christian> guess you had to be there
[4:36:23] <Kalmana> You got this. Eye of the tiger and all that
[4:36:27] <TheFramedWarlock> The game designer has failed us
[4:36:44] <SomeOtherNeb> not every game can be a masterpiece like Heavy Rain :(
[4:36:51] <CoffeeCobra> he really did say that and Jaffe just piggy backed on it LUL
[4:36:52] <+swymbiote> shaaaaaaun
[4:36:53] <gan_n_dorf> true but that also sounds like a Jaffe gaffe

[5:24:47] <zedravan> ypu beat lightning boi you got this
[5:24:54] <Hammatime8> !motivated
[5:24:54] <@Moobot> @Hammatime8 2494 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[5:25:00] <Yomamma1337> you kind of skipped a ton of easier bosses
[5:25:08] <a_mad_dragon_> it's A final boss
[5:25:09] <Carlioo> !motivated
[5:25:23] <+TheOlMitcheroo> pacifist is not the default for this game
[5:25:25] <Yomamma1337> :)
[5:25:26] <+TheOlMitcheroo> That's an undertale bias
[5:25:31] <nyacoo> it kinda is
[5:25:31] <Mr_Rakjo> pacifist is not default
[5:25:37] <%emptyantics> Pacifist is not the default
[5:25:39] <exnuart> they told you to kill
[5:25:49] <+swymbiote> they want to die
[5:25:50] <civilized_worm12> not killing things DansGame
[5:25:50] <PKSomething> This is the Sans fight of this game
[5:25:51] <exnuart> and you directly went against it
[5:25:53] <%holydeviant1> Pacifist is not the default
[5:25:55] <Yomamma1337> try out the right side for the zigzags
[5:26:01] <%waltzqueen> you liked undertale? wel MERCY THIS
[5:26:03] <Lisonfire> pacifist is not the default by any means
[5:26:16] <zedravan> you signed a contract you broke the NDA this is your punishement
[5:26:17] <+TheOlMitcheroo> the pacifist and genocide are swapped around in this game from Undertale
[5:27:34] <Mr_Rakjo> not the hardest but its kinda up there
[5:27:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[5:27:39] <Yomamma1337> its not the easiest path
[5:27:47] <+TheOlMitcheroo> It's like 2nd hardest
[5:27:48] <Kalmana> Hard path
[5:27:48] <exnuart> its not 4 hour hallway hard
[5:27:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Johns
[5:27:52] <Mr_Rakjo> 2nd hardest
[5:27:56] <+notgoodatnamessorry> 3rd hardest
[5:28:10] <Yomamma1337> its not a 1 to 1, as there are more endings in this gamer
[5:28:13] <Yomamma1337> game*
[5:28:15] <velgaduere> 4nd hardest
[5:28:19] <velgaduere> :)
[5:28:20] <+notgoodatnamessorry> 4th if you consider hallway difficulty
[5:28:34] <+swymbiote> this is 2nd hardest for me
[5:28:39] <+tempestzephyr> pat beat genocide
[5:28:39] <+swymbiote> light > this > something else
[5:28:40] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Everhood pacifist is a subversion from Undertale
[5:28:40] <%crybirb> I don't think it is, Sans takes a lot of learning but it's very doable.
[5:28:46] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus Pat beat genocide
[5:28:51] <DXLelouch24> are you worse than Pat?
[5:28:52] <%emptyantics> This was 3rd hardest boss imo
[5:28:53] <+swymbiote> light < this < something else* i mean
[5:29:01] <+notgoodatnamessorry> then 3rd hardest
[5:29:06] <exnuart> time is the hardest boss really
[5:29:17] <%andrewofbob> Genocide demands your will to do it
[5:29:22] <%crybirb> I mean that's up to the person, but Genocide is pretty doable, I think DSP could do it.
[5:29:41] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I feel like this boss is right on par with Sans, they both took me the same time to beat
[5:29:41] <%emptyantics> *other boss < Light < Frog
[5:30:05] <+Flarepulse> Sans Everfrog
[5:30:07] <velgaduere> the question is... is this the True Hero? or is this "the guy"?
[5:30:20] <+maria_luke> I guess if you want everyone to live ya gotta earn it here.
[5:30:37] <%crybirb> I think this fight is the type that you take a break, hours or next day, and you can do it easier. Sans was like that, took a break and then in the second try after the break I did it.
[5:30:43] <velgaduere> because the Battle Against a True Hero is also QUITE difficult
[5:30:56] <+swymbiote> @velgaduere the guy
[5:31:04] <+PMAvers> RNG take the wheel!
[5:31:17] <%waltzqueen> fell the rhytm in your Soul
[5:31:24] <%holydeviant1> "Luck is a skill" says the man blessed by the heavens and God himself
[5:31:40] <Yomamma1337> try right for my sanity lol
[5:32:00] <+teriyaki_drinker> WHAT did i tune into
[5:32:12] <Mr_Rakjo> @teriyaki_drinker Boss fight
[5:32:17] <jimgimp> Thats the wall you brain hits when you're trying to figure something out, thers stuff you're brain has to unlock for you in order to apply it
[5:32:21] <LoneFonte> @teriyaki_drinker superboss time
[5:32:21] <Mr_Rakjo> Against the metal frog
[5:32:26] <BlackermanZX> it almost worked LUL
[5:32:29] <%emptyantics> @teriyaki_drinker Kermit the frog turned into Sephiroth and he’s fighting Red Geno
[5:32:34] <Zeneeba> ...i mis most of the stream because work and come back on this part. awesome.
[5:32:42] <jimgimp> Happened to me with MK9 during the Shao Kahn fight
[5:32:44] <conchthechimera> hey at least the opening hook is decent
[5:32:47] <%holydeviant1> @Mr_Rakjo with a halo of guitars/wings of guitars
[5:32:48] <PortableBoredom> Jesus how long has he been on this fight, I was here like an hour ago and he was doing this
[5:32:57] <velgaduere> @PortableBoredom it's gonna be a lot longer than this
[5:32:59] <kulmoth> FIGHT FOREVER!!
[5:33:10] <%holydeviant1> @PortableBoredom It's basically the Sans of the game
[5:33:23] <jimgimp> Got frustrated, sat down and watched tv for 5-10 minutes, came back, first try
[5:33:27] <+teriyaki_drinker> scottfOhno
[5:33:32] <T_Sasquatch> hit the showers
[5:33:35] <sundizzle> i remember I had to switch control schemes for this game sometimes
[5:33:42] <Yomamma1337> no
[5:33:43] <nyacoo> Easy heals you faster
[5:33:48] <BlackermanZX> check the tapes see what is the correct path
[5:33:55] <Pookiedaexzile> No
[5:33:57] <Kalmana> I'd say no. Not the hardest
[5:33:57] <hiddenllama4> there's two that can be argued to be harder
[5:33:58] <Zeneeba> ...nope
[5:34:01] <%Indigo_Automaton> No
[5:34:01] <ChrisPlaysThing> He's the Hoppiest
[5:34:03] <zedravan> the limit of the human body
[5:34:05] <Yomamma1337> top 4 at least
[5:34:07] <+notgoodatnamessorry> no, but it's the hardest I consider fair
[5:34:09] <+Flarepulse> There is one post-game boss on an even higher level
[5:34:15] <%emptyantics> No
[5:34:18] <Yomamma1337> try the right side
[5:34:20] <%holydeviant1> hippity hoppity your SOUL IS MY PROPERTY
[5:34:21] <Zeneeba> i'd say...third hardest? right chat?
[5:34:23] <AngryAsian5> Oh God, there are other bosses that are harder?
[5:34:29] <+maria_luke> it's fine to change difficulty y'know?
[5:34:29] <%emptyantics> @zeneeba Agreed
[5:34:33] <Yomamma1337> there are way fewer parts on the right side of the zigzags
[5:34:42] <%emptyantics> Change difficulty to Normal
[5:34:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:34:44] <Lisonfire> this is like 2nd or 3rd hardest
[5:34:45] <nyacoo> @AngryAsian5 There's NG+ content
[5:34:46] <Rolandknight> this might be a time to stop and chill for a bit. the brain is burning.
[5:35:01] <Mr_Rakjo> Yeah Frog is 2nd or 3rd Hardest
[5:35:04] <zedravan> right side seems clearer on the zig zags
[5:35:07] <Mr_Rakjo> depending on opinion
[5:35:12] <Yomamma1337> you can stick to the right side form the end of the green all the way through the zigzag
[5:35:15] <ChrisPlaysThing> Plate is full, mouth is full, throat is full, she can't take no more captn
[5:35:15] <Yomamma1337> from*
[5:35:24] <+notgoodatnamessorry> remember woolie, there is no shame in changing difficulty, just judgement and ridicule
[5:35:33] <hiddenllama4> gellot on youtube has a no hit run if you want to check it out
[5:37:10] <%legacy0117> Don’t count Woolie out just yet, and besides the stream only has so much more to continue. He wants hard mode. He thrives on the challenge.
[5:37:12] <%emptyantics> Woolie just change the difficulty to Normal, there’s no shame
[5:37:39] <BlackermanZX> try right side
[5:37:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> If he changes it to normal he’ll just heal more the path wont change
[5:37:49] <exnuart> its a memorization game at the end of the day
[5:37:50] <nyacoo> But he might need that heal
[5:37:54] <Pookiedaexzile> THere is shame,
[5:38:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> True the extra heal might help
[5:38:06] <Pookiedaexzile> And We will remember that
[5:38:15] <Yomamma1337> open path on the right
[5:38:19] <@SoushinSen> remember Woolie, there's no shame in putting this in a harder difficulty than this.
[5:38:34] <ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[5:38:35] <BlackermanZX> right side actually seems more open

[6:11:36] <Yomamma1337> the right is the answer
[6:11:42] <Yomamma1337> literally just stay there the entire time
[6:11:44] <HotSauceFiend> I beat this by saying on the right side
[6:11:55] <HotSauceFiend> EXACTLY
[6:12:00] <BlackermanZX> theres a path on the middle i can see it
[6:12:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Its two to the right when the zig zag comes
[6:12:08] <%xeromage> there's like two waves, and you wanna track where the yellow one and the rainbow one cross?
[6:12:08] <%pretax159> right side is the way
[6:12:08] <%ekodrop> reggie's right. the later half of that section you can jump middle
[6:12:12] <Yomamma1337> @BlackermanZX yeah but its way harder than jsut staying on the right
[6:12:15] <%waltzqueen> i see the middle path! it's hard but there
[6:12:19] <%Giothegame> He's beginning to believe
[6:12:30] <%xeromage> nope i'm stupid

[6:12:41] <magnumlockjaw> REALITY IS BREAKING
[6:12:43] <conchthechimera> frog power too strong for game
[6:12:43] <Zeneeba> i beat it by stayin on the right and shootin some of the walls. it's harder stayin in the middle but once you got a hold on that pattern it's doable.
[6:12:44] <nyacoo> Is it the game - or is it you?
[6:12:44] <%waltzqueen> HURT ME MORE
[6:12:55] <BlackermanZX> the pc is starting to ascend too
[6:12:59] <%HeroToxiko> what if that hallway never stopped loading LUL
[6:13:01] <+Ravenian96> frogtorias of the riffs
[6:13:08] <arizenarkana> Monitor's gonna start smoking when you start to win.
[6:13:09] <+swymbiote> the game used to have a pretty bad memory leak but i thought it was fixed
[6:13:16] <mrtanaka111> woosh
[6:13:22] <magnumlockjaw> Your PC is on Frog's side now too
[6:13:23] <HotSauceFiend> you could deflect as well
[6:13:26] <%emperordread> Retry
[6:13:27] <+BigBruthaThunda> oh yeah there is a known memory leak issue with this game. the longer its running, the greater the chance of frame skipping or longer loading times
[6:13:33] <HotSauceFiend> deflect helps in that section for sure
[6:13:36] <Yomamma1337> on the right you can just jump through them
[6:13:38] <+BigBruthaThunda> the devs said they'd fix it but never did
[6:13:43] <+maria_luke> if it crashes before you beat it I won't blame you for finishing the stream early.
[6:13:46] <%pretax159> you catch and jump
[6:13:55] <+chief_chongo> doodInjury
[6:13:58] <+Shonen_hero> yeah closing out and restarting might help with performance
[6:14:07] <HotSauceFiend> @BigBruthaThunda I never knew about that. THena gain, I never played for 5+ hours straight
[6:14:16] <TheFramedWarlock> Does closing save your checkpoint ?
[6:14:18] <lurkbait> What those others guys said- restarting the game might help cause there's a memory leak issue w/ the game
[6:14:31] <lurkbait> @TheFramedWarlock I don't think so, that's the problem
[6:14:36] <+BigBruthaThunda> @HotSauceFiend luckily I only experience the longer load times, but others have reported the skipping
[6:15:05] <+ArtsyFoxo> @lurkbait A memory leak issue? oof Hopefully that gets fixed soon
[6:15:21] <lurkbait> It's been an issue for a while, they never patched it
[6:15:26] <+diathex> Ugh gotta get in the shower an goto bed but i wanna see that win!
[6:15:27] <HotSauceFiend> Btw, for any people interested int he audio, this song is called REvenge on the OST. I could listen to this once daily. On high quality its fantastic
[6:15:38] <+BigBruthaThunda> the devs said they were fixing it in March 2021, so idk lol
[6:15:47] <+diathex> At least the song is good.
[6:16:00] <$ArCielArDor> come on, Woolie, it's just a frog.

[6:16:06] <a_mad_dragon_> just keep pushing the memory leak until notes can't appear any longer 4Head
[6:16:31] <BlackermanZX> at the start of the zig zag you have to be on the right side
[6:16:32] <Yomamma1337> stay on the right for the zigzag
[6:16:38] <zedravan> race the memory leak until your save is deleted
[6:16:44] <HotSauceFiend> I doubt it would get fixed. This 2021 game seems to be the first game made by these developers.
[6:16:47] <Yomamma1337> i literally just tried it and got past it on my first try

[6:17:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:17:07] <+diathex> Remember the NES days! you got this shit!
[6:17:50] <HotSauceFiend> wait is he still playing on hard
[6:17:53] <OkamiDude15> yes
[6:17:56] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @Pookiedaexzile
[6:18:00] <Punzosaurus> HES IN THE MATRIX
[6:18:01] <Jaysky> I see we're stilling fighting Frog Jesus
[6:18:13] <double_zr_tap> THERE IT IS
[6:18:15] <OkamiDude15> woolie can see the line
[6:18:34] <HotSauceFiend> that right side blue wall messed up my no-hit run of this boss and I stopped attempting it
[6:18:39] <%emptyantics> STREAM CONFIRMED FOR ANOTHER 5HRS
[6:18:40] <%hukurowl> might be break time
[6:18:41] <+Ravenian96> nightmare nightmare nightmare
[6:18:48] <lurkbait> Woolie, you may just need to take a breather
[6:18:48] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[6:18:49] <%hukurowl> sleep on it, go do somethin else
[6:18:52] <%waltzqueen> Stay Determined
[6:18:56] <Zeneeba> don't have retry again please. XD
[6:18:57] <+diathex> Reminds me of dodging the crossbow trap in DES but MUCH longer.
[6:19:00] <%pretax159> breath boy
[6:19:11] <%Lion_kun> If Woolie quits here, will the game have the decency to not restart the fight
[6:19:11] <+Celarious> Have they experienced the rest of the game or did they just go straight for pacifist frog cbt
[6:19:13] <%emptyantics> LUL
[6:19:22] <BlackermanZX> well he did reach the 2nd part in like 10 mins so if he stops here it aint that bad
[6:19:24] <%waltzqueen> @Celarious pacifist instantly
[6:19:26] <OkamiDude15> @Celarious cbt
[6:19:29] <lurkbait> @Celarious They went straight for pacifist
[6:19:45] <+S3xGAZEBO> You can do it Wools!!!
[6:19:51] <Pookiedaexzile> You can ride the right side on the zig zag with precise jumps
[6:19:55] <+Shonen_hero> earn your bad route Woolz
[6:19:59] <Yomamma1337> woolie pls just stick to the right for the zig zags
[6:20:10] <Zeneeba> he almost had it agian
[6:20:11] <+Saggitori> stay determined
[6:20:13] <HotSauceFiend> change difficulty!
[6:20:15] <AngryAsian5> Almost
[6:21:12] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus  stick to the right starting from the end of the green its way easier
[6:21:40] <+diathex> It's so hard to ignore the rhythm of the other instruments. it wants you to only react to the guitar.
[6:21:53] <%atlasdotwav> Da da da dauh uh uh uh uhda da da dauh uh uh uh
[6:22:04] <HotSauceFiend> For all the love i give this game, my biggest gripe is that you focus so much on the lower half of the screen, its easy to miss the visuals
[6:22:04] <+Shonen_hero> this makes the incinerator sequence look easy
[6:22:12] <+diathex> and it's nonsensical during the arpeggios.
[6:22:25] <%pretax159> that part jump and go left i guess
[6:22:31] <HotSauceFiend> @Shonen_hero nooooo, that incinerator is pure bs.
[6:22:54] <HotSauceFiend> that incinerator is 12 minutes long and has a section with pure rng fires popping up
[6:22:56] <@Menitta> it's weird because the notes start when they reach your character, not when they appear
[6:23:04] <%pretax159> oh shit
[6:23:07] <+maria_luke> @hotsaucefiend wait w h a t
[6:23:21] <+Shonen_hero> whoa though
[6:23:22] <zedravan> further than before
[6:23:25] <+Shonen_hero> that was progress
[6:23:27] <%kinetikpaws> better
[6:23:27] <AngryAsian5> Progress is progress
[6:23:40] <+swymbiote> the incinerator is so hard that if you beat it, it assumes you've previously beaten the main story and are coming back to it
[6:23:49] <+swymbiote> because the text afterwards is a spoiler for the end
[6:23:53] <+diathex> we got genuine tilt.
[6:23:59] <+Shonen_hero> ah okay
[6:24:05] <%atlasdotwav> It's deserved tilt
[6:24:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[6:24:41] <Yomamma1337> you can start on the right fyi, you dont have to pivot to it
[6:24:45] <+Shonen_hero> I gotta give Woolz credit, he's getting there
[6:24:50] <+maria_luke> @swymbiote whoa... if only they beat it  back then. That'd be funny.
[6:25:22] <BlackermanZX> hug the right until that part
[6:25:24] <arizenarkana> yeah that lures you into false security
[6:25:33] <+swymbiote> @maria_luke it's not as overt as 'here's what happens at the end' but you won't understand what it means, or you'll work out the ending by logical process by trying to understand it
[6:25:53] <+maria_luke> @swymbiote ah, okay.
[6:26:32] <HotSauceFiend> yeah the incinerator line kinda puts the rest of the game into a different context that you should be playing on a fresh run
[6:27:07] <%xeromage> Is there a cue in the music you can listen for to know when to switch sides?
[6:27:08] <HotSauceFiend> great defelct
[6:27:20] <HotSauceFiend> SO close
[6:27:23] <%Lion_kun> IT WAS RIGHT THERE
[6:27:27] <kingra> Damn
[6:27:27] <Zeneeba> closer. he hung in the right too long
[6:27:29] <OkamiDude15> RIGHT THERE
[6:27:29] <BlackermanZX> SO CLOSE
[6:27:30] <+Shonen_hero> YOU WERE SO CLOSE
[6:27:31] <%pretax159> its so close
[6:27:33] <ATentacleMonster> the strong will
[6:27:35] <%Lion_kun> HE AHD A GAP
[6:27:39] <%Lion_kun> HE HAD A GAP
[6:27:42] <Bl4kDynamite> I think we can tawste it
[6:27:53] <HotSauceFiend> the cue would probably the second piano-keytar bit
[6:27:55] <Bl4kDynamite> *taste
[6:27:55] <%emptyantics> So CLOSE
[6:28:40] <Pookiedaexzile> That was the Gap
[6:29:00] <%emptyantics> Fun Fact he’s been in this fight for 2 hours and 17 minutes
[6:29:08] <+Shonen_hero> sounds like Woolie could use some LSD
[6:29:23] <%pretax159> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[6:29:28] <HotSauceFiend> if you want to you can also deflect those green walls. its requires some timing tho
[6:29:43] <+maria_luke> honestly, your tenacity is amazing.
[6:30:04] <Zeneeba> it's a kickass song and stupid hard fight. even on easy.
[6:30:04] <+Flarepulse> This game was made for drugs. Drugs like Adderall
[6:30:07] <%emptyantics> Tenacity is at it’s limit for today
[6:30:10] <+nochejunior> did someone count the number of attempts?
[6:30:30] <Mr_Rakjo> a lot
[6:30:30] <shinichizio> @nochejunior I think Green Mage was on that
[6:30:35] <Mr_Rakjo> like the past hour
[6:30:35] <+vaporousTippler> Hey, the "no" was on beat, at least.
[6:30:36] <+maria_luke> Yet he keeps going. it's incredible.
[6:30:41] <%emptyantics> This’ll be at least 4 episodes of the anime LUL jkjk
[6:30:46] <+Grayhammatter> almost
[6:30:49] <nyacoo> he does not lack DETERMINATION
[6:30:54] <%waltzqueen> @emptyantics mid season movie
[6:30:59] <+Shonen_hero> man, you sure you don't wanna just kill 'em all and set 'em free? Kappa
[6:31:01] <HotSauceFiend> @Flarepulse depends on the drug.  I did not enjoy this on specific weeds for sure
[6:31:02] <%waltzqueen> STAY DETERMINED
[6:31:04] <%emptyantics> @waltzqueen LUL LUL LUL
[6:31:14] <HotSauceFiend> wait what does reggie have to do?
[6:31:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:31:22] <%andrewofbob> I haven't seen this level of determination from Woolie since V2 in Ultrakill, and that was 117 restarts
[6:31:23] <cust0> PowerUpL majinoWoke   PowerUpR
[6:31:25] <%emptyantics> WOOLIE WE BELIEVE
[6:31:27] <Zeneeba> XD
[6:31:29] <Yomamma1337> the game was screaming at you to kill people lol
[6:31:34] <quendillar> I mean the game tried SO HARD to get you to go the normal route lol
[6:31:34] <+maria_luke> @emptyantics feels like 10 tbh. but maybe that's because I feel the frustration?
[6:31:40] <Zeneeba> LUL it happens. I did it the first time too.
[6:31:40] <+swymbiote> it was very insistent about you killing people
[6:31:45] <MikeyxStyles> don't worry woolie this is what we're here for tbh
[6:31:51] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus Game said Fuck Yo Pacifism
[6:31:55] <Yomamma1337> yes you shouldve
[6:31:59] <+ConLin_Arts_> csbeastScared csbeastScared csbeastScared
[6:32:02] <nyacoo> the choke
[6:32:07] <Yomamma1337> right 2 columns are death at the end
[6:32:09] <Zeneeba> you shoulda stayed. you left, and you shouldan't have went back
[6:32:10] <OkamiDude15> you should've committed
[6:32:14] <%waltzqueen> Ganbatte!
[6:32:14] <Bl4kDynamite> MIddle has less going on at that part ho
[6:32:15] <quendillar> Yeah this for sure doesn't bother me, but don't get salty at the game haha. You made this choice!
[6:32:16] <+theoldone001> Hesitation is Defeat
[6:32:36] <BlackermanZX> at the end the right side is complete death and you can see it
[6:32:44] <HotSauceFiend> seeing is one thing, when you actually play this you get so focused on your lane that the middle becomes imperceptible
[6:32:59] <+Shonen_hero> ah, so this wasn't an intentional branching, Woolie was just waiting for all the cards on the table before making an informed decision. Yeah, no, the minute you spare someone when you had the chance to, you won't get that again and so are hard confirming pacifist route
[6:33:00] <quantumnp> @woolieversus yo just wanted to say I really enjoyed your disco elysium lp
[6:33:48] <Yomamma1337> dont stay youre gonna die
[6:33:58] <%emptyantics> This boss fight will last until Elden Ring comes out LUL
[6:34:11] <%oneimportantthing> Holy fuck I left for like 2 hours and expected the stream to be over by now lol
[6:34:13] <+swymbiote> SO CLOSE
[6:34:13] <HotSauceFiend> ITS SO CLOSE
[6:34:15] <+Flarepulse> CLOSE
[6:34:16] <Yomamma1337> far left side is easy at the end
[6:34:17] <OkamiDude15> ITS RIGHT THERE
[6:34:17] <BlackermanZX> SO FUCKING CLOSE
[6:34:17] <%waltzqueen> SO CLOSE
[6:34:20] <%pretax159> OHHHHH
[6:34:21] <AngryAsian5> ALMOST
[6:34:22] <Mr_Rakjo> SO CLOSE
[6:34:22] <zedravan> close
[6:34:23] <%kinetikpaws> aaaaa
[6:34:31] <+Shonen_hero> I feel so bad, 'cause Woolie is so close
[6:34:31] <BlackermanZX> get into the middle when the last blue walls appear
[6:34:31] <%waltzqueen> ONE MORE
[6:34:31] <+notgoodatnamessorry> I think that was literally the end
[6:34:33] <%oneimportantthing> you were SECONDS away
[6:34:40] <%atlasdotwav> New PR
[6:34:40] <quendillar> Honestly his brain might be wearing out at this point. Take a break man! Just cause you can't do it now doesn't mean you can't do it
[6:34:40] <Yomamma1337> literally seconds away
[6:34:49] <%emptyantics> Literally seconds away
[6:34:52] <%emptyantics> It hurts to see
[6:34:52] <%townzzzzz> bullshit blazing
[6:34:54] <%atlasdotwav> My eyes are doing the guitar hero now lol
[6:34:59] <Zeneeba> so close man. you're right there.
[6:35:02] <Yomamma1337> you got this
[6:35:04] <+maria_luke> it's incredible that this doesn't keep him down. This would be a gut punch to me!
[6:35:10] <%waltzqueen> !motiated
[6:35:10] <Zeneeba> also we can all agree that frog can play
[6:35:10] <%oneimportantthing> Take a breather
[6:35:15] <%pretax159> ITS TIME
[6:35:18] <%oneimportantthing> In fact, you can do this tomorrow
[6:35:25] <%atlasdotwav> I B leaf
[6:35:53] <DXLelouch24> if he takea breather he has to do it ALL OVER AGIN
[6:35:59] <Yomamma1337> you dont have to pivot to the right just stay there the entire time
[6:36:01] <DXLelouch24> AGAIN*
[6:36:10] <BlackermanZX> he did it all over again and did it pretty fast
[6:36:16] <Zeneeba> @oneimportantthing  I'll be honest, if that were me, this would be my night until i beat it. i was there before. XD on this exact fight.
[6:36:27] <HotSauceFiend> yeah getting to this point isnt the problem.
[6:36:37] <HotSauceFiend> restarting this fight isnt a huge pain
[6:36:43] <DXLelouch24> yea but thats Thursday, his human brain may forget everything as human brain do
[6:36:43] <%oneimportantthing> But can the frog play Smoke on the Water?
[6:36:54] <Zeneeba> Can he play wonderwall
[6:37:10] <mrtanaka111> dont die woolie
[6:37:10] <Yomamma1337> gotta move from the right there
[6:37:14] <quendillar> WNDRWL?
[6:37:29] <%atlasdotwav> Free Bird?
[6:37:30] <+dreaith1> can he play stairway to heaven
[6:37:33] <hiddenllama4> the middle feels a little safer when it gets real chaotic at the end
[6:37:39] <Pookiedaexzile> You got move from the Right when you leave
[6:37:39] <Yomamma1337> you died right where you were supposed to cross
[6:37:43] <%oneimportantthing> Today is gonna be the day when they're gonna throw it back to you
[6:37:46] <BlackermanZX> you have to leave the right side at that point
[6:37:46] <+Shonen_hero> Woolie sounds like his soul has left his body.
[6:37:56] <HotSauceFiend> @dreaith1he can probably play every song imaginable considering how long they've lived for
[6:37:58] <Zeneeba> imagine someone usin the frog and chartin through the fire and flames in this game
[6:38:28] <HotSauceFiend> and again, IMAGINE if this fight had BS hallucinogenic stuff as well
[6:38:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:38:45] <Yomamma1337> dont refill on orange
[6:38:50] <mrtanaka111> break tre wall down
[6:38:56] <Zeneeba> @HotSauceFiend  That would be hell
[6:39:02] <Arqartur0> Woah, just got back, is this the third phase!?
[6:39:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Dodge The Wall
[6:39:09] <Yomamma1337> @Arqartur0 there are only 2 phases
[6:39:14] <Pookiedaexzile> You have space on the side every time
[6:39:19] <%oneimportantthing> Woolie is big tilted LUL
[6:39:26] <BlackermanZX> focus on the walls
[6:39:26] <Arqartur0> Holy shit, that hard, eh!?
[6:39:32] <%emptyantics> WOOLIE is too far gone
[6:39:34] <%emptyantics> LUL
[6:39:35] <Yomamma1337> @Arqartur0 farthest hes gotten was like 10 seconds from winning
[6:39:35] <exnuart> gotta train the ear
[6:39:37] <%atlasdotwav> There's two @arqartur0 he accidentally hit retry when u left
[6:39:37] <mrtanaka111> woolie has that look of DETERMINATION
[6:39:42] <quendillar> I think Woolie is tunnel visioning
[6:39:56] <HotSauceFiend> @Arqartur0 it doesn't help that the longer he plays this game, the more prone the game is to lags, frame skips, etc
[6:40:20] <Pookiedaexzile> The Walls can be dodged in that ection
[6:40:28] <mrtanaka111> is this sequence harder than incinerator?
[6:40:39] <HotSauceFiend> @mrtanaka111 absolutely not
[6:40:44] <mrtanaka111> jesus
[6:40:47] <+Shonen_hero> I don't wanna say Frog is Sans, 'cause it's not *that* contrived but he is essentially serving as the last stand to help free everyone
[6:41:10] <Yomamma1337> you need to pivot there
[6:41:22] <mrtanaka111> hes suffering
[6:41:26] <mrtanaka111> for us
[6:41:30] <HotSauceFiend> @Shonen_hero i never saw it that way, but you are right, he isn kinda a Sans isnt he
[6:41:43] <%oneimportantthing> Do it for HER
[6:41:43] <+notgoodatnamessorry> you need to pivot to the middle after the first 2-3 blue walls
[6:41:59] <HotSauceFiend> @mrtanaka111 he doesn't have to suffer for you, if you go buy the game and suffer for yourself
[6:42:06] <%atlasdotwav> Won't be a next time he got it
[6:42:10] <zedravan> once multiple multiple walls start to appear you cannot stay there
[6:42:14] <+Shonen_hero> In a way, thematically he's doing this for entirely different reasons and it's not a 1 for 1 analogue, but he essentially the gate keeper yeah
[6:42:16] <HotSauceFiend> also I'd love to support these creators on their next endeavor
[6:42:24] <quendillar> @atlasdotwav *cough*
[6:42:43] <VincentGraves> somebody did this without getting hit
[6:42:46] <mrtanaka111> @HotSauceFiend jokes on woolie, i already have the game
[6:42:50] <+trinto2> i feel like part of it is literally just your eyes getting lost in all the visual noise rather than something being hard to dodge, at least thats how it is for me
[6:43:18] <arizenarkana> Woolie gonna be thinking about this frog in his sleep.
[6:43:19] <%oneimportantthing> Left side might be safer
[6:43:21] <mrtanaka111> this is the LAST ONE
[6:43:24] <+Ravenian96> ho.llowed
[6:43:31] <mrtanaka111> this is his last war
[6:43:40] <%atlasdotwav> Leggo
[6:43:46] <MikeyxStyles> give him your energy
[6:43:56] <+maria_luke> @trinto2 yeah it's very hard to read unless you're actively looking at the size and color from a bystanders perspective.
[6:44:07] <%oneimportantthing> Chat send him the power of our friendship
[6:44:11] <%Orcapugs> We are still going. Damn
[6:44:17] <+maria_luke> seeing it during play would be very difficult
[6:44:18] <Yomamma1337> gotta go left after that first blue after the break
[6:44:21] <%Lion_kun> at the second wave of walls, you have to move
[6:44:21] <mrtanaka111> he really chokes on that stretch
[6:44:25] <quendillar> Good man, take a break and come back fresh! Thanks for the stream!
[6:44:31] <hiddenllama4> good try
[6:44:33] <%townzzzzz> time to rest and think about it

[6:45:06] <%xeromage> good shit Woolie. Very fun
[6:45:08] <%atlasdotwav> The guitar line turns into the superoff beat there too
[6:45:09] <Zeneeba> it's fine.
