[0:11:20] <%kewlmyc> OOPS ALL BANE
[0:11:27] <+robo_trunk> City is miles better for the bosses
[0:11:29] <%bread_assassin> It's Bane all the way down.
[0:11:32] <%BusterRepukken> i just hate part 6's ending, i hate multiverse shit.
[0:11:36] <$Superdandy96> Boss fights are big oofs
[0:11:36] <bbblaketwitching> honestly, would quick time events have been better?
[0:11:37] <$alwaysneedcaffiene> alwaysneedcaffiene subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! oh turns out I have one of these to redeem, dont know what message to put other than, pocket circuit/shogi charity stream when? (not really though. :P)
[0:11:40] <frostyjay3> Awww yes. My favorite boss fights Bane, Bane... and more Bane.
[0:11:40] <+NopeBadguy> You're a big guy
[0:11:42] <plaguedoctor_syan> i have a hope that the reason part 6 is taking so long is because they are trying to do the same with part 5 and add some new stuff to add the story
[0:11:48] <Tracazoid> Maybe we should find a mod for Woolie that just turns all the enemies, bosses and characters in cutscenes during Arkham City into Bane.
[0:11:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> U U U U
[0:11:49] <dds333a> Honestly, the bosses aren't great, but Woolie wasn't doing himself any favors by straight up doing the Bane fight incorrectly

[0:24:23] <Halospaz117> Dub Nanba is Greg Chun, therefore it is impossible for him to be bad

[0:24:29] <%TooManyGs> member hugging people?
[0:24:32] <disflipmat> @X2Eliah oh wow, I played through with the dub so I had no idea. He's a great character in english anyway
[0:24:37] <SereneFox> I can't recall the before times, nor the fun of ren faires
[0:24:46] <Halospaz117> Seriously, I think Greg Chun might be my 2nd favorite VA after JYB
[0:24:47] <%ZweihanderSteve> dubbo
[0:24:49] <+runegod20> i do dig japanese nanba way more
[0:24:51] <thedudeinthered> Bruh, I just want to go to McGibbin‚Äôs and hit the arcades again....
[0:24:55] <DedlokPM> @nanaki_ff14 I kinda doubt it. IIRC it is like mid-game that it appears.
[0:24:56] <Sulfur_Boride> @VidulaSaix Well, you ain't wrong. Kiryu's JP actor apparently hated doing the karaoke originally since he had to learn how to sing BADLY
[0:24:56] <+nabs2099> Never thought I would be hyped to return to a dub!

[0:25:17] <Solidnick18> yeah the loading screens are 8 bit
[0:25:18] <Zeif00> every loading
[0:25:19] <pyjama_day> Dub Nanba to me is basically 'i am doing a cool voice, but its so much effort to keep it up that i forgot to emote.' Same as Tak from Judgement
[0:25:20] <+khalcipher> Englis dub?
[0:25:21] <%ZweihanderSteve> DORAGON QUESUTO
[0:25:21] <disflipmat> Yep, the 8 bit sprites increase as you get more party members

[0:26:05] <leith_aziz> Part chat is Great
[0:26:05] <jcflyguy> Ok stop showing off
[0:26:05] <xeros720> ps5 surpasses pc load times pretty often
[0:26:10] <Prevot> is that dragon quest style party chat?
[0:26:10] <Qualityhugeweeb> PS5 available? yeah sure
[0:26:12] <downwiththethickness99> Nanba is voiced by Greg Chun but he sure isnt fighting for his friends LUL

[0:26:38] <+nanaki_ff14> I got my PS5, but all i play is that stupid Gundam game im addicted to and spend $100s of moneys
[0:26:41] <%ggbhtg> Visual Novella
[0:26:43] <leith_aziz> Thats insightful
[0:26:44] <+Razputin217> sipsipRude
[0:26:47] <SereneFox> How many internal organs must I sell for this "PS5"?
[0:26:47] <Sulfur_Boride> I like how Greg Chun distinguishes his Yagami and Nanba voices by making Nanba's battle grunt sound intentionally half-assed
[0:26:48] <dds333a> Rude, Ichiban
[0:26:52] <leith_aziz> Nanba strecthing
[0:26:52] <+runegod20> and they do unlock a way later to relisten to those conversations, which is nice
[0:26:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> stetching nanba?
[0:26:54] <+duichenko> after the Arkham vid that is ironic
[0:26:55] <%nicversus> @WoolieVersus Nanba's english voice is Greg Chun, who is the english voice for the main character Yagami from Judgment
[0:26:56] <brachydios777> Genius
[0:26:57] <%justcallmebobplease> "...You came up to talk to me, why are you checking your phone, Ichiban, SO RUDE!"
[0:26:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Dear woolie:
[0:26:58] <Solidnick18> taxi is so helpful
[0:26:58] <Darren716> MAKE SURE YOU USE TAXIS FIRST
[0:26:58] <+AnarchicAnimeFan51> Hey Taxi!

[0:27:12] <+duichenko> that is not how I imagined Nanba :(
[0:27:13] <Darren716> You have to interact with them in order to unlock them
[0:27:15] <brachydios777> Luckily Taxis are cheap
[0:27:15] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's LIKE a dragon
[0:27:16] <Solidnick18> it means rebirth

[0:27:59] <%kyh9> It's a Dragonfish, so it's LIKE A DRAGON
[0:28:00] <RyuShinden> Dragonfish has a legend of swimming upstream to become an actual Dragon
[0:28:02] <Jalexster> FYI, there's japanese mythology about a koi swimming up-river to become a dragon.

[0:29:05] <%nicversus> I keep calling him NAMBLA
[0:29:08] <Blank9> Nanba's basic attack also counts as magic damage, which is another rad thing for casters.
[0:29:10] <leith_aziz> You missed some great scenes with him
[0:29:15] <%kewlmyc> I like it. Not sure where the haters are coming from.
[0:29:17] <TigerClaws12> SKILLED

[0:32:46] <%cache_22> That was Woolie's first "real" attempt at the minigame.
[0:32:47] <LVL1_Scumbag> He's so proud
[0:32:47] <+Hacerous> Cantastic!
[0:32:48] <%Lion_kun> Oh a B
[0:32:48] <ndcoten> make use of the Lucky Litterer, you rack up points real quick
[0:32:50] <$QueequegTheater> I would say 30 seconds is enough to go back but man, Woolie is INEXPERIENCED in GTA driving, huh
[0:32:50] <+runegod20> @brachydios777 i think one of the essence moves you learn in freelancer actually does that
[0:32:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Garbage truck and lady with trash bag leave a trail of many cans
[0:32:53] <DedlokPM> @Freakin_Wolfy First time playing it outside of the story forcing you
[0:32:58] <Jalexster> @Freakin_Wolfy His first time playing it out of the mandatory time you have to
[0:33:01] <Hopit> I played this minigame for 6+ hours 10/10 would can again
[0:33:05] <DSD24> There's some good shit in the rewards
[0:33:06] <%Lion_kun> I S ranked all difficulties.
[0:33:15] <brachydios777> @runegod20 Really?
[0:33:20] <%akuda_bar> i love this idea that the homeless are doing this because they want the street clean rather than money
[0:33:22] <%Interface23> Interface23 subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:33:24] <aluddss> persona 5 track
[0:33:28] <leith_aziz> Well.......Its just more subtle in my areas
[0:33:29] <SunsetJack> You gotta ask yourself, how?
[0:33:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> someone SPREAD Cans for this game on clean Tokyo streets
[0:33:32] <dds333a> Climbing the mountain of recyclables
[0:33:38] <DatAsuna> youhavent seen japanese rivers
[0:33:40] <downwiththethickness99> Dont get Yen. Not worth it
[0:33:44] <MagumaDono> There are some collectables that are just helpful in there for later missions
[0:33:45] <samazam94> turns out Japan is super clean because of the homeless
[0:33:51] <+runegod20> yeah, one of the heat moves does different heat moves from the dragon engine, but it's based on being near stuff like traffic cones or signs, otherwise it's just a basic heat move
[0:33:52] <urkleturtle> maybe there's so little pollution because the hobos pick it all up?
[0:33:52] <xeros720> lots of random junk in here
[0:33:53] <+Stormiercashew> yeah the yen ones are garbo conversions
[0:33:54] <Sulfur_Boride> They recommend you NOT to exchange Can points for money
[0:34:00] <DatAsuna> i saw whole ass bikes tossed in the river
[0:34:00] <%Bosni9> Keep going down in the menu
[0:34:00] <+NopeBadguy> There's better stuff near the bottom of the menu
[0:34:03] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Yen not worth it, you get huge point boosts for each title you get
[0:34:06] <brachydios777> I imagine the Sotenbori river isn‚Äôt exactly clean
[0:34:08] <Darren716> Yeah read the rest of the menu
[0:34:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> TREASURE SPOTTED
[0:34:08] <%justcallmebobplease> Look at the menu bottom for cans
[0:34:09] <+runegod20> i think his inventory expands?
[0:34:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oh yeah, just ignore the rest of the shop list
[0:34:11] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus THere was WAY more in the shop
[0:34:14] <%justcallmebobplease> Good shit at menu bottom for can shop
[0:34:24] <%notsoy> yeah the higher difficulties on the can game can easily get you thousands
[0:34:28] <DSD24> AWW YEAH
[0:34:29] <leith_aziz> Nanba ALWAYS is so far
[0:34:30] <pi_in_the_sci> you can climb that ladder on your left
[0:34:31] <dds333a> Pretty high fidelity parking garage

[0:34:35] <%Noonoox12> Yeyeyeyeye
[0:34:36] <pyjama_day> @WoolieVersus Tip for this would be to actually save your cans for later on. Quite a few items from there are needed for sidequests and cost a tonne
[0:34:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NANBAS FAR AGAIN
[0:34:37] <DSD24> I love when that happens
[0:34:38] <%Noonoox12> Pog as fuck
[0:34:38] <majindusto> WOOLIE IGNORED THE TREASURE
[0:34:39] <%cache_22> Pathing PogChamp
[0:34:39] <+Hacerous> TELEPOR
[0:34:41] <Solidnick18> yeah he will telport
[0:34:42] <brachydios777> PogChamp
[0:34:42] <%ZweihanderSteve> Even the parking garages look good in this game!!!
[0:34:45] <%BusterRepukken> seeing some homeless guy run at you down the street would be scary
[0:34:47] <malbarrough> Nanba Nyoom'd LUL
[0:34:47] <TigerClaws12> eat your heart out cyber punk
[0:34:48] <%notsoy> and those can points are obviously best spent on stuff, not money
[0:34:53] <ndcoten> it only occasionally does A Warp (if it takes more than 10s to resolve a path)
[0:34:55] <Doctadaking> He really IS a wizard!
[0:34:56] <Jalexster> They actually WILL teleport if they get stuck or take too long
[0:34:57] <Solidnick18> sometimes they can track
[0:34:58] <+duichenko> cmon nanba we're fighting
[0:34:58] <Blank9> "CHOSEN ONE" "I'M COMING"
[0:34:58] <leith_aziz> In EVERY playthrough I've seen, Nanba stays so far
[0:34:59] <srv4254> why always nanba tho
[0:34:59] <aluddss> if it gets real bad they tele
[0:35:04] <%BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus don't be afraid to use abilities with nanba, his regular attacks gives him mp back
[0:35:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he was RUNNING to beat the crap out of that guy
[0:35:09] <dds333a> That's what they are
[0:35:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Head back in the parking garage, theres treasure inside!
[0:35:21] <twoto858> Venting out on the homeless
[0:35:21] <%CodenameChaz> Apparently if they absolutely can't figure out the pathfinding, it will just teleport them to the target
[0:35:24] <%cache_22> Computer show me Celery Men, wait...
[0:35:25] <%BisoromiBear> Bateman vs Ghost Dog
[0:35:28] <brachydios777> Now that was a trash hill
[0:35:30] <leith_aziz> I would just say J-Pops
[0:35:34] <%Interface23> Interface23 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel!
[0:35:34] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Make sure to run away from a fight to see Ichiban's run animation
[0:35:35] <%Interface23> Interface23 gifted a Tier 1 sub to bevyrage!
[0:35:35] <+RootVeggie> You‚Äôre homeless? I‚Äôll kill you!
[0:35:45] <red_fox_zero> Far right corner of the parking garage.
[0:35:51] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus I mean, the trope of "teens beating the fuck out of homeless people" is more common in anime/manga than you'd think...
[0:35:52] <urkleturtle> "fuck the homeless, we're gonna attack them" is actually a problem in japan
[0:35:56] <dds333a> That's what was mentioned earlier
[0:36:00] <Jalexster> The game wants you to go to Hello Work
[0:36:04] <NotHereToStream> also yokohama is huge in this game

[0:37:41] <+runegod20> huh, i thought they opened up later since we passed by where a few would be, and they're not marked yet

[0:53:00] <+karldeck> You need to create fast travel point
[0:53:00] <p_e_a_x> always talk to a taxi
[0:53:00] <+spardanwarrior> Stars above minimap tell you area difficulty
[0:53:01] <+Stormiercashew> you should unlock the taxis by talking to them,
[0:53:02] <Jalexster> You can

[0:53:06] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus interact with taxis to unlock them as locations
[0:53:07] <pineapplepervert> You need to use them to unlock waypoints

[0:53:09] <fIashman92> You can only travel to taxis you have talked to
[0:53:09] <+Stormzcales_Lair> TALK to them to unlock

[0:53:10] <leith_aziz> This is so different
[0:53:11] <%cache_22> You can only travel to taxis you have talked to beforehand.
[0:53:11] <+Stormiercashew> you can only go to taxis youve talked to
[0:53:11] <Lunatyr64> you just gotta talk to them to unlock
[0:53:11] <skyentombment> Don't let Woolie see the Vergil ass coat there
[0:53:12] <+paladinstarbuster> You have to talk to unlock
[0:53:14] <+FlyingRamen> i think you have to interact with taxi locations to unlock
[0:53:15] <$QueequegTheater> Take the taxi the fuck out of Koreatown
[0:53:15] <leith_aziz> I kinda like that
[0:53:16] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus You gotta talk to taxis at least once to unlock them on the map
[0:53:17] <@Menitta> Oh yeah you gotta unlock the taxis as you play. You touch a taxi and then you can use it
[0:53:17] <Drunkengen> you need to unlock travel points
[0:53:18] <invader_rin> Unlock every taxi you come across by interacting

[1:18:15] <CappuccinoGuil> @Puhff it is, it's just a funny odd name
[1:18:15] <Sulfur_Boride> @Puhff "Ichiban" is literally the common term for "Number 1" in Japanese
[1:18:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:18:17] <$QueequegTheater> @Puhff It's his real name but it literally means "Number One"

[1:18:18] <halfmasks> @Puhff Its naming your kid "The Best"
[1:18:20] <$Superdandy96> I wished that worked in real life
[1:18:26] <penitentpendant> It's a little expensive for you at the moment
[1:18:27] <solracc25> Spend that Stimmy

[1:18:50] <+shad8snake> spend all that money
[1:18:51] <MagumaDono> Lmaooo spend the stimmy

[1:19:16] <grouchio> Yeah you
[1:19:16] <+RootVeggie> Just give back the money they just gave you
[1:19:17] <+Birdro> If you take recommended meal it's a guaranteed resource top off, good reasons to pick meals too though
[1:19:19] <leith_aziz> So, cobos didnt work till I reached a certain part in the story
[1:19:20] <+AugustRei> don't do recommended
[1:19:21] <moonmintparadise> is that a monster hunter like menu set ???

[1:19:32] <+Proxzo> Did they take pictures of real foods? Or are those CG?
[1:19:32] <+nabs2099> @thefabianstrategy Batman son of Superman?
[1:19:33] <%ZweihanderSteve> make it a meal
[1:19:33] <+AngelYoumou> Sometimes it's Two items
[1:19:33] <Sulfur_Boride> Too expensive
[1:19:34] <+rubeSandwich> you start this game so poor and by the end you can purchase satelites
[1:19:34] <+Jack8274> Usually it's an app, a main, and a drink
[1:19:34] <twoto858> Yes
[1:19:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Malt and Edamame?
[1:19:39] <%bPlusPlus> your too broke for this please
[1:19:40] <+runegod20> yeah, all at the same time, and it has to be the right combo
[1:19:40] <hassanico2> Fried pasta?!
[1:19:41] <pi_in_the_sci> not always three, sometimes two
[1:19:43] <brachydios777> Curry is technically a western food to the Japanese because it was brought by the British at the time, right?
[1:19:46] <$QueequegTheater> You can buy a lot at once
[1:19:46] <Blank9> combos are hidden, best way to find them is eating everything at once
[1:19:48] <Sulfur_Boride> It has to be specific items in a combo
[1:19:48] <red_fox_zero> You get unique dialogue if you do the right combo, too.
[1:19:50] <leith_aziz> @QueequegTheater huh. I probably wont remember that, but thanks for telling me
[1:19:51] <Hopit> You can buy everything there is and it unlocks all the combos
[1:19:56] <dds333a> @hassanico2 is delicious
[1:19:58] <+Schrodingers_Box> You can buy all
[1:20:01] <+king_of_beggars> If you buy everything on the menu it autofills all the menu sets. Not useful now, but info for later.
[1:20:10] <thefabianstrategy> Jesus typing on a smart TV is sloooooooooow
[1:20:11] <+Schrodingers_Box> You can buy more than 3 items at a time
[1:20:12] <+0neReeler> doesn't show, gacha mechanics
[1:20:12] <+NopeBadguy> ITADAKIMASU
[1:20:14] <HollowMan190> tasty
[1:20:14] <hassanico2> Itadakimaaaas
[1:20:14] <Puhff> ME
[1:20:17] <leith_aziz> So combos didnt work for me till I reached a certrain part in the story
[1:20:18] <CappuccinoGuil> He's poor, chat LUL
[1:20:19] <disflipmat> okay that is hilarious with just one party member
[1:20:19] <%notsoy> only specific combos give the bonus effect
[1:20:25] <dds333a> OISHII
[1:20:31] <leith_aziz> Man, you can tell Nanba hasnt eaten much
[1:20:34] <Darren716> Yeah you need to order specific food
[1:20:35] <+runegod20> we probably only have another session at most after this one, if we get anymore at all
[1:20:35] <$QueequegTheater> @leith_aziz there are very few false walls in the over world, you can look them up on a guide easily
[1:20:35] <Solidnick18> i just bought them all at once
[1:20:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> BUY ALL TO FIGURE THEM OUT
[1:20:37] <Maleicus> no
[1:20:39] <Doctadaking> Kinda awkward with just one guy, huh
[1:20:40] <penitentpendant> Sets give you bonuses in future fights.
[1:20:41] <+RootVeggie> So tasty!
[1:20:41] <+KShirahama> combos a normally side + main + drink
[1:20:45] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Buy them all at once
[1:20:47] <NorthGrizzly> no
[1:20:48] <+Williamld> Reccomendation is never the buff
[1:20:48] <Jalexster> You're at full HP/MP
[1:20:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @GeneralSCPatton he literally can't afford everything
[1:20:49] <+Schrodingers_Box> BUY EVERYTHING
[1:20:50] <+FlyingRamen> just be rich and order one of everything
[1:20:52] <$QueequegTheater> The whole menu
[1:20:53] <+Birdro> Recommended will not trigger combo sets
[1:20:53] <majindusto> Nope
[1:20:53] <Darren716> Guys it doesnt matter, just buy everything once you have money
[1:20:54] <leith_aziz> Recommendation dont it seems
[1:20:54] <+AugustRei> I dont think thats it
[1:20:59] <disflipmat> Woolie once you start getting money, just buy the entire menu and it'll unlock all the combos
[1:21:02] <MagumaDono> When you have money just buy the whole menu
[1:21:02] <NorthGrizzly> Just move on
[1:21:03] <+shad8snake> youll have enough money to buy the whole menu later
[1:21:04] <%BestTeaMaker> recommendations aren't a set bonus
[1:21:07] <Jalexster> Honestly, you can wait until you're drowning in yen later in the game before doing this
[1:21:08] <Blank9> never think of it until you can buy the whole menu
[1:21:09] <penitentpendant> Recommendations give you no buffs, just 'heal you to full'
[1:21:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cappuccinoguil Doesn't matter. That's the later strat.
[1:21:10] <$QueequegTheater> OH BOY WAS THERE
[1:21:11] <TheyCallMeVawn> Time for some VF?
[1:21:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @majindusto
[1:21:12] <%BestTeaMaker> they're just an instant food option
[1:21:17] <+runegod20> we probably won't play the game long enough to get to the point where we could just buy everything at once
[1:21:17] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> I love Ichiban's shit-eating grin in the bottom right
[1:21:22] <Robot_Nixon_> TTours
[1:21:23] <ForrestofFallenTrees> Some of the combos don't make sense so eventually just literally buy everything at once to find them all at once
[1:21:25] <red_fox_zero> Once hou have more money just buy everything at once every time you go to a restaurant.
[1:21:31] <@Menitta> I wish you could ride the Ferris wheel
[1:21:31] <%jonblnt> super runaway

[1:21:51] <MagumaDono> The threat level adjusts on zones and you
[1:21:54] <+shad8snake> itll adjust

[1:40:11] <%BusterRepukken> a weapon you cant use yet

[1:41:25] <razgrizsilver> Huh, wouldn‚Äôt have thought woolie doesn‚Äôt do car stylin
[1:41:26] <%X2Eliah> Cars 100% look all the same now
[1:41:26] <Drunkengen> I watch alot of Top Gear but i dont care too much about cars
[1:41:28] <%bPlusPlus> vintage car also terrible efficiency
[1:41:32] <%DkLordG> I'll take whatever drives, but I would love a Thunderbird
[1:41:32] <dds333a> Yeahz the old flatbeds
[1:41:37] <+Jiggisnipe> well everyone is copying each other so they'll all look similar
[1:41:37] <BlackermanZX> LOL
[1:41:39] <NorthGrizzly> You can equip it LATER after the next story mission
[1:41:40] <+ChubbyPencil> Honda Beat tho
[1:41:41] <solracc25> Isekai trucks?
[1:41:41] <+king_of_beggars> Go ahead with the story just a little more so you can unlock job changes.
[1:41:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> sso same thing Kappa
[1:41:42] <ghoststalker> Japan has small boxy trucks they call kei cars
[1:41:43] <dds333a> We had them in DR
[1:41:45] <+KShirahama> they look similar because safety requiments
[1:41:47] <+threeheadedwalrus> Aerodynamics and safety are limiting
[1:41:49] <GlaceonYo> Equip bat?
[1:41:51] <Jalexster> You cannot equip the bat
[1:41:53] <+johnnychopsocky> I liked my old Kia Soul. Was easy to spot in a crowded parking lot
[1:41:55] <Zeif00> mystery machine?
[1:41:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @GlaceonYo can't
[1:41:55] <%dreadedcthulhu> also probably has a sick wizard airbrushed on the side
[1:41:57] <halfmasks> its cause new cars actual need to be aerodynamic and economic too, so they tend to be the same profile
[1:41:59] <GlaceonYo> ah
[1:42:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Bat is job specific
[1:42:05] <penitentpendant> You need the class associated with it
[1:42:07] <%Huntercd> Like the Mystery Machine?
[1:42:08] <%Javaa01> Weapon types are job specifc
[1:42:09] <CappuccinoGuil> You should DEFINITELY do all the sidequests now
[1:42:09] <PsychoPearl> The other substory?
[1:42:09] <@Solidus_113> Everything becomes honda civic
[1:42:09] <red_fox_zero> Bat is a style.
[1:42:10] <Darren716> Sub story down south
[1:42:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah you need to progress a bit
[1:42:12] <23rald> 90s has best car
[1:42:14] <%Javaa01> You currently don't have a job
[1:42:15] <penitentpendant> Weapons are class based
[1:42:20] <NorthGrizzly> THE JUST THIS NEXT STORY PART

[1:42:22] <+Zanzibar_Junker> After the coming mission
[1:42:25] <PsychoPearl> You can if you progress the story
[1:42:26] <ghoststalker> Ichiban hasn‚Äôt gotten his job upgrade yet to get his bat on
[1:42:26] <BlackermanZX> man i love this theme
[1:42:28] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus All weapons are locked to their respective jobs (classes)
[1:42:29] <Doctadaking> Just like Shinada...
[1:42:29] <+ChubbyPencil> Car safety ratings destroyed cool car designs
[1:42:34] <%bPlusPlus> corollas still look like shit

[2:14:08] <Robot_Nixon_> Only criminals get arrested atpLaw atpCop
[2:14:11] <morningmoondude> the virgin 99% conviction rate vs teh chad Phoenix Wright
[2:14:11] <penitentpendant> Can't risk that promotion~
[2:14:12] <Doctadaking> Part of Judgment‚Äôs plot, that conviction rate
[2:14:13] <+krispen_wa> kasumi then joined the Dead or Alive Tournament

[2:14:52] <Tardispardis> The plot in Judgment really digs into this bullshit
[2:14:58] <DatAsuna> ACAB
[2:15:07] <+nabs2099> ACAB
[2:15:07] <%X2Eliah> Ichi...
[2:15:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> AJCAB
[2:15:12] <kifflomdolphin> @ghoststalker I believe that wholeheartedly. But, as another Adachi said, it's against criminal procedure code.
[2:15:12] <ghoststalker> @leith_aziz oh, you have no idea. If the Japanese cops want you, they‚Äôll hold you until they can get you
[2:15:14] <%BestTeaMaker> ichiban, that's what happened to you
[2:15:15] <hassanico2> Expect Adashi
[2:15:16] <Dante_Namikaze1> ACAB
[2:15:17] <+paladinstarbuster> adachi was a cop guys
[2:15:19] <thedudeinthered> Teetering on the scandal teet
[2:15:28] <+the22cstomp> @paladinstarbuster keyword was
[2:15:29] <Tennochief> what part of, "I'm a cop who's trying to help people" do you not understand?
[2:15:30] <+nabs2099> Adachi is not a cop anymore
[2:15:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ACEAAB = All Cops Except Adachi
[2:15:33] <+nabs2099> ACAB
[2:15:34] <+paladinstarbuster> so is tanimura
[2:15:36] <Dante_Namikaze1> @paladinstarbuster not a cop anymore
[2:15:39] <penitentpendant> So the cops 'Epsteined' the guy so he wouldn't spill the truth
[2:15:47] <AhmCha> The reason we say ACAB is because Adachi was a good cop and his reward was being fired from being a cop
[2:15:48] <penitentpendant> Rough
[2:15:51] <Meltgar> Cops doing a bad thing? What are the odds Kappa
[2:15:54] <+paladinstarbuster> and DATE
[2:15:54] <kifflomdolphin> So, is Adachi-san just Japanese Breaking Bad Mike?
[2:15:54] <%jonblnt> Adachi is just an old shounen protagonist
[2:15:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Epstein did not commit the die

[2:30:12] <GlaceonYo> Do not sell that bat
[2:30:12] <Jalexster> RED IS HOT. BLUE IS COLD.
[2:30:13] <+Jack8274> But do not sell it
[2:30:13] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe it's Japan
[2:30:13] <ForrestofFallenTrees> That's Jrpg as fuck
[2:30:13] <%kyh9> It's not dragon quest
[2:30:14] <CappuccinoGuil> @Drunkengen can't sell basic gear
[2:30:14] <+king_of_beggars> Starter bat can be crafted

[2:30:26] <%BusterRepukken> Keep beginner bat.
[2:30:26] <Blank9> it's like X/O on playstation controllers, X is no and blue, O is yes and red
[2:30:27] <+Hacerous> Dilf hunter
[2:30:28] <Iwashi94> Red Circle -> Good | Blue X -> bad
[2:30:29] <pineapplepervert> RED PILL VS BLUE PILL

[2:30:33] <+Jiggisnipe> they do the same thing with stocks where red is good and green is bad
[2:30:33] <+cubbywolf> oh I guess alot
[2:30:34] <+BlackMageMog> I look at it is Red= turning up the heat and blue = cooling down

[2:30:44] <%BusterRepukken> do not sell beginner bat whatever you do
[2:30:45] <+runegod20> i think more that they look for older guys since they assume they have money since they've been working for years
[2:30:47] <red_fox_zero> Keep that Hero Bat forever.
[2:30:49] <+Diredoe> I think it's more people who beat up older guys because theoretically older = wealthier
[2:30:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> No you cannot

[3:51:29] <+MightyDuckShoes> Remember that Ichiban was raised from birth to adulthood as a literally prostitute baby raised by her pimp.

[3:52:08] <deviljhojho_> the situation understander has arrived
[3:52:10] <Jaysky> Thank you Adachi?
[3:52:12] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie Ichiban's a himbo that grew up in a soapland, of course he'll be biased as heck in a dumb way.
[3:52:16] <%PrishKitla> again he is a a hole but not exactly wrong
[3:52:17] <dexdestroyazz> It's like syaing 'If i make you Understand the sleaze, you be ok with it' but its like 'Oh no, we understand, and its SITLL BAD'
[3:52:19] <+CaptainJax> G R E Y Z O N E
[3:52:23] <RyuShinden> No Woolie, just continue., You will get it
[3:52:23] <wibbwobbler> WutFace
[3:52:29] <deviljhojho_> Look man ichi... had a weird upbringing
[3:52:29] <%BusterRepukken> Grey zone of morality.
[3:52:29] <HollowMan190> I cant believe this ex yakuza has questionable morals
[3:52:30] <CrazyMedicine> Bathroom Break PogChamp
[3:52:31] <Deko_> LUL

[3:52:32] <Jalexster> @turbofolk That about sums it up LUL
[3:52:35] <+Jack8274> Shit is about to get real
[3:52:35] <+traximus_s> oof
[3:52:37] <%CodenameChaz> "Better the devil you know"
[3:52:37] <AngryAsian5> Ichiban grew up in a Soapland, so it's pretty on brand for him.
[3:52:39] <Enyoyable> Morally gray LUL
[3:52:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/wooliewoolz/status/1372228846108483586?s=21
[3:52:39] <HalloweenHangover> Ichi's childhood gives him more insight.
[3:52:41] <eldragon_1> "The devil you know", basically
[3:52:42] <Komayeda> Okay, so I think his argument is "this guy is bad, but he could be a *lot* worse."
[3:52:42] <missingangle> Oh Ichi
[3:52:49] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:52:52] <+LiquidSnakesArm> I think you're jumping the gun Woolie
[3:52:54] <laguerrilha> @WoolieVersus He saying the guy that understand the situation and admits it is better than the guy that sugar coat it
[3:52:55] <linSP> why are you booing him, he‚Äôs right
[3:52:58] <solracc25> Steamy save
[3:52:58] <%itschickenscratch> just give it time

[3:53:06] <Ids560> Like I'd still side with this guy over the cock cage club over there but he sucks
[3:53:06] <Second_Omega> The argument is literally "Eh could be worse"
[3:53:07] <Nekros4442> you're jumping the gun
[3:53:08] <+the_vedo_show> give it time yeah
[3:53:09] <Blank9> He's got high school dropout former yakuza 18 years in prison morality, be patient.
[3:53:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> You don't even know sbfpSetIn
[3:53:10] <Jaysky> THE RIGHT THING
[3:53:10] <Doctadaking> Ichiban is the only one defending this guy. Everyone else is reasonable
[3:53:11] <skyentombment> Everyone stop complaining, all we need is some Theme of Sad to make it perfectly ok!
[3:53:11] <+0neReeler> ichiban the hero
[3:53:13] <%justcallmebobplease> Ichiban grew up in a soapland raised by both the girls and the guy running it - of course he's biased in their favor.
[3:53:14] <majindusto> IT GETS WORSE (subject matter wise)
[3:53:16] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus I 100% agree and I hate this plot point, but I try to keep in mind that in Ichi's head he was raised by people like this and has a hard time seeing the problem
[3:53:18] <OldManDeckardCain> the fact that woolie is more disturbed by this than wandavision is wild LUL
[3:53:18] <+LiquidSnakesArm> I cannot stress enough, you're jumping the gun.
[3:53:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god now i can't wait for him to get back to 0 for one quest
[3:53:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Bleach Japan is Chat right now
[3:53:26] <+Liquid_Dio> It's almost as if this is a grey area... that should be bleached white
[3:53:27] <samazam94> guys stfu let him get there
[3:53:27] <%BusterRepukken> People really dont like being challenged i guess
[3:53:28] <librettodude> Gotta trust the narrative

[3:53:42] <deviljhojho_> lets see what happens
[3:53:44] <ghoststalker> Just ride it out bro
[3:53:48] <+Jack8274> I love seeing the initial reaction before it becomes Yakuza
[3:53:49] <Solidnick18> I LOVE ICHI

[3:53:51] <Jalexster> Imagine trying to morally grandstand while playing a fucking Yakuza game LUL
[3:53:52] <skyentombment> @WoolieVersus Stop complaining, you're gonna get that Theme of Sad and you're gonna see how it's all ok!
[3:53:52] <MAX116030> and now he wont get it for another 10 years

[3:54:01] <$QueequegTheater> Don't get hair stuck in it
[3:54:02] <+Stormiercashew> theme of soapy sad
[3:54:04] <+duichenko> the David Cage
[3:54:04] <Spagheddies> Consider the following: If the girl uses the soapland, she has the soapland's protection. If she bypasses the soapland, she loses the soapland's protection. Neither situation is good, but one is certainly the lesser of two evils.
[3:54:04] <deviljhojho_> hoo crikGnome

[3:55:14] <Doctadaking> Remember, Ichiban is the dumb one. Everyone else in the game has their heads on straight
[3:55:14] <Qualityhugeweeb> Weird sex stuff
[3:55:15] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> @dexdestroyazz Yeah, from what I know it's pretty in tune with Japan's politics, very pro-free market
[3:55:16] <reonome> THIS IS A GREY AREA
[3:55:16] <Solidnick18> LUL
[3:55:18] <Tham1k> Oh hell yeah
[3:55:19] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus I 100% agree and I hate this plot point, but I try to keep in mind that in Ichi's head he was raised by people like this and has a hard time seeing the problem.
[3:55:19] <majindusto> SIGH
[3:55:20] <+LiquidSnakesArm> @scwry You are with Bleach Japan, aren't you?
[3:55:21] <+justianxix> LUL

[3:55:30] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie I actually know finance, THAT'S NOT HOW THE MINT WORKS
[3:55:30] <deviljhojho_> ichiban has some bagage
[3:55:30] <Louie_Salmon> THIS IS STILL WILD THOUGH
[3:55:34] <@Solidus_113> Himbo who grew up in that exact situation
[3:55:34] <Solidnick18> lmao
[3:55:34] <Ids560> Like I understand why ichiban has the perspective he has but the game agreeing with him is where I take issue
[3:55:35] <%OverlordLuna> he's 5Head
[3:55:35] <turbofolk> He grew up in this places
[3:55:36] <+paladinstarbuster> Youre picking out the one guy
[3:55:37] <linSP> fuck bleach japan we stan scummy soapland man
[3:55:37] <RyuShinden> No Woolie, this is different LUL
[3:55:37] <%that__tj> Picked out a good chastity cage yet?
[3:55:37] <penitentpendant> I mean, it's nice that a game motivates discussion to a degree
[3:55:37] <DSD24> Well he has Wisdom though
[3:55:40] <+Jack8274> You need to remember, his literal Father was this guy. His dad ran a soapland
[3:55:42] <Deko_> big heart of gold
[3:55:43] <cellaccount> soaps got to clean
[3:55:46] <+s_xylocalsingles> @WoolieVersus yeah look at Pat, biggest Himbo
[3:55:49] <exnuart> he's a literal dumbass woolie
[3:55:50] <ghoststalker> Bleach Japan is worse
[3:55:50] <PsychoPearl> He grew up in a soapland he knows his shit!!
[3:55:50] <themememovement> He also grew up in a Soapland so he's kinda biased
[3:55:50] <+JustBlubs> Right!
[3:55:51] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @nabs2099
[3:55:52] <+scwry> @LiquidSnakesArm I respect sex workers unlike him Kappa
[3:55:56] <Blank9> I mean, Kronk worked for the villain the entirety of The Emperor's New Clothes.
[3:55:58] <turbofolk> @WoolieVersus Woolie He grew up in this shis Values are already off
[3:55:59] <%Afterman_> amogus
[3:56:00] <+colezone_> calm down woolie
[3:56:00] <MagumaDono> Lmao "Let's just justify morally bad things." We as the viewer can still disagree with how the game wants to spin it
[3:56:01] <Blank9> er, groove
[3:56:01] <+trialbyrespawn> he's grew up in a soap land
[3:56:02] <+PapaGravestone> but hes a himbo on the side of justice so soapland owner is an angel
[3:56:06] <Tham1k> Everything is gonna be fiiiine
[3:56:07] <CappuccinoGuil> I think they tried to go for a thing here and it DID NOT LAND
[3:56:08] <Torgue_1> It is, though
[3:56:10] <NotHereToStream> raised in a whorephanage
[3:56:11] <%PrishKitla> this is also the worst of it, the moral of the game is pretty go from here
[3:56:12] <+paladinstarbuster> Ichiban grew up in a soapland he understands
[3:56:12] <fIashman92> Everyone reacts to this the same. Woolie's not alone
[3:56:13] <+LiquidSnakesArm> @scwry Just let the story play out.
[3:56:15] <+Jack8274> I think he sees Nonomiya as a father figure like his father
[3:56:15] <samazam94> ichiban is raised by a soapland owner. his pov is warped
[3:56:17] <@Solidus_113> His life is a soapland
[3:56:18] <deviljhojho_> It was a different time! 2019!
[3:56:19] <foxname96> is this it for today?
[3:56:19] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus He grew up in a soapland so he's biased
[3:56:21] <asurite_warrior> @WoolieVersus I'm willing to say Ichi has seen worse dudes than this scumbag. Also what's the better option you can offer in this situation. I dont see one that Ichi can offer.
[3:56:24] <%BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus you're just gonna have to keep playing to figure out this point of view
[3:56:25] <Mahbonk> a very weird cliffhanger to leave on LUL
[3:56:25] <%CodenameChaz> Like even his friends were like "Heeey Ichi, no"
[3:56:25] <+MightyDuckShoes> characters can also learn, Woolie. they aren't a mouthpiece. You already saw when he told the homeless just to get a job.
[3:56:26] <dexdestroyazz> @Chester_goes_Berserk yeahh, one of those topics that kind amakes you step back from the 'Japans soo great and wonderful' and realise that Ohhh its got issues, just like everywhere else.
[3:56:26] <MAX116030> I have thoughts but Im not gonna talk here. Because Woolie can talk and I have text, Such themes discussions are not suited to talk here
[3:56:26] <%GroundControl138> ichiban's father was in the same shoes as the scumbag, hence looking for justifications
[3:56:28] <ForrestofFallenTrees> You literally related kume being a piece of shit to being a woman my dude then went off on someone else
[3:56:32] <RyuShinden> Ichiban literally grew up in a soapland, He knows.
[3:56:33] <+justianxix> the lesser of two soaps Woolie THE LESSER OF TWO SOAPS
[3:56:33] <big_laser_boss> I don‚Äôt get that feeling. It feels like he‚Äôs supposed to be smart here considering his upbringing
[3:56:37] <Spagheddies> TBH the owner is a wet-ass C-word. That said, I feel like the game's writers did not intend for him to come off like that. Not that it matters much.
[3:56:39] <disflipmat> Yeah, this whole part's pretty dumb and thankfully Nanba and Adachi call him out on it
[3:56:40] <majindusto> Woolie beginning to agree with Bleach Japan enigmaKEK
[3:56:40] <+LiquidSnakesArm> Woolie jumps the gun so fast though.
[3:56:43] <the_krypto_knight> The problem is more that it‚Äôs obvious that Ichi is speaking for the developers

[3:58:51] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Nagoshi
[3:58:53] <%X2Eliah> Guys it's not that Ichi is defending this scumbag guy, it's that *the game* is casting nonomiya as a good guy despite him clearly doing sleazy-as-fuck shit

[3:59:25] <emmmdeekay> Nagoshi
[3:59:27] <+nabs2099> @liquidsnakesarm It's 50/50 rn and if you've played Yakuza you know a lot of people get theme of SAD who don't deserve it
[3:59:29] <plaguedoctor_syan> Well this can take a while how many streams of like a dragon left? it was 15 hours right?
[3:59:33] <CalciumTax> you don't bleach things that are already white
[3:59:35] <themememovement> People who fall between the cracks of society didn't get there by choice basically.
[3:59:39] <+BloodyBurney> the game is called The Whereabouts of Light and Darkness
[3:59:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[3:59:55] <Mahbonk> fk u , Kume you stinky head LUL
[3:59:57] <mrdejesus34> Toshihiro Nagoshi. He grew up in poverty.
[3:59:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> most of them just want donations and to rile people up to exploit the believers
[3:59:58] <%BlueJoneleth> MY GRANDMA RAN A BROTHEL AND I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT. XD
[4:00:08] <Doctadaking> Having a discussion isn‚Äôt wrong.
[4:00:09] <linSP> it‚Äôs GREY
[4:00:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Benji Genshiro
[4:00:12] <308caliber> yup it's not just black and white
[4:00:12] <laguerrilha> On one side you see girls that legit got a reason to be there, the other you seem assholes taking advantage of it
[4:00:12] <+nabs2099> @liquidsnakesarm Alright.
[4:00:13] <NotHereToStream> just solve it 4Head
[4:00:27] <%MajorCrasher> Just get a job!
[4:00:35] <+LiquidSnakesArm> I'm saying that they're jumping the gun and coming to a conclusion too fast.
[4:00:37] <+bonanzo> just legalize everything 4Head
[4:00:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just defeat SOCIETY 4Head
[4:00:41] <ForrestofFallenTrees> Humans hate change and the longer things last the harder they are to change

[4:00:42] <%Juriasu> woolieONEGUY is on the job, he will bring about world peace
[4:00:43] <%X2Eliah> Fun fact, real japanese yakuza are super involved in trafficking

[4:01:04] <CalciumTax> i'm down to a few months rent and looking for work still, i'll suck a dick.
[4:01:07] <+nabs2099> I just think we should all seize the means of (re)production bro. Fuck the middleman
[4:01:13] <shieldecho> Even the most basic "All you have to do is acknowledge that sex workers are people" is somehow hard for some people
[4:01:14] <terramagus> If you do X or Y hard enough, you too can scorch the earth
[4:01:16] <+traximus_s> but you don't have to treat the downtrodden like shit
[4:01:24] <%Namillus> @nabs2099 phrasing
[4:01:27] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Yakuza 7 does this better than the other hot topics this time too, because instead of just the character you play as, you can have guys like Nanba and Adachi still really be like, I don't agree with this, but I will help you
[4:01:29] <+LiquidSnakesArm> Just get back to the game
[4:01:30] <thedudeinthered> We went through all this in KOtoR, come on chat...
[4:01:32] <Torgue_1> @nabs2099 Only if he pays up

[4:01:41] <plaguedoctor_syan> Yhea i been in some conversations about drug addiction and the person say to me "just lock them up and treat them"
[4:01:45] <colzack_> I think Ichiban is a great vehicle to tell a story about these subjects through considering his upbringing on the streets

[4:06:44] <DatAsuna> I always listen to both and option select the better one.
[4:06:44] <Blank9> Shit, YYH is a good english one.
[4:06:44] <Torgue_1> Covers of what?
[4:06:44] <$QueequegTheater> BIT BY BIT I'M FALLING UNDER YOUR SPELL
[4:06:47] <+nabs2099> English covers of OPs can be REALLY good tho
[4:06:48] <clloudberry> english covers of ops are mostly trash
[4:06:48] <Deasmeister> Sometimes
[4:06:50] <ghoststalker> In most cases, bad. Some are decent tho
[4:06:50] <+innawoodssage> they have a purpose
[4:06:51] <mrdejesus34> Yu Yu Hakusho's is great.
[4:06:51] <Tracazoid> I enjoy plenty of them, depends on the artist. Love most of Amalee's stuff.
[4:06:53] <reonome> hell yeah smile bomb is good
[4:06:53] <Safarihat> reel big fish ravelution is best
[4:06:54] <twohitgood> No. Can't do English OP's.
[4:06:56] <DSD24> I prefer hearing all the dialogue in a language I understand
[4:06:56] <+shad8snake> theyre mostly bad
[4:06:57] <Ner234> Just like everything else: Some are good
[4:06:57] <passserby> sailor moon's english op slaps
[4:06:58] <exnuart> yuyu hakusho's OP in english is still a banger
[4:06:58] <+paladinstarbuster> yo jubyphonic
[4:06:59] <%jinking79> for Comedy maybe
[4:06:59] <laguerrilha> Some can be REALLY good
[4:07:01] <PanicSwytch> I agree
[4:07:02] <grouchio> One Piece Rap
[4:07:03] <majindusto> I am Perfectly with English Covers
[4:07:04] <%PrishKitla> if done while it can be as good as the og song
[4:07:05] <mrdejesus34> As long as it isn't fuck Freckles.
[4:07:06] <Blank9> I like American DBZ opening theme better than japanese one.
[4:07:07] <jorniev> ITS BETTER IN SPANISH
[4:07:07] <clloudberry> Latin american dubs of ops are the shit though
[4:07:08] <CalciumTax> The english rap done by the whitest fucking dude in every japanese HYPE song makes me cringeeee
[4:07:09] <@Solidus_113> Oversoul vs 4Kids Shaman King OP
[4:07:09] <Prevot> I can only speak for brazilian versions, but I like most of them
[4:07:10] <%PrishKitla> well*
[4:07:10] <moonmintparadise> pokemon and sailor moon
[4:07:11] <Wahrow> Yuyu Hakusho's Smile Bomb in English is great
[4:07:12] <red_fox_zero> Noooooo most of the time.
[4:07:12] <+traximus_s> usually whatever I hear first
[4:07:14] <reonome> FIGHTING EVIL BY MOONLIGHT
[4:07:14] <OldManDeckardCain> GERMAN NARUTO OP
[4:07:15] <DemonDude656> x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy
[4:07:15] <Klefth> Great Days in English is a mistake
[4:07:17] <+nabs2099> absolutely
[4:07:17] <Tham1k> As long as they don't change the whole song
[4:07:18] <solracc25> Some just butcher the english covers
[4:07:20] <majindusto> *Perfectly OK
[4:07:24] <Doctadaking> I like things when they‚Äôre good. Weird, I know
[4:07:25] <PsychoPearl> Sono chi no sadame. Joooooojoooo
[4:07:27] <thedudeinthered> I‚Äôm just thinking of the Rurouni Kenshin english OP and cringinf
[4:07:30] <+freystreams> listen to richie kotzen's Gundam covers, they are 10/10
[4:07:30] <big_laser_boss> If it‚Äôs good then it‚Äôs really cool
[4:07:32] <Burningfajitas> First time tuning into a live stream, happy I could catch it. Long time listener first time caller. I'm on Yakuza 5 now and can't wait to get to 7 but I'm living it through you for now, thanks for the fun commentary W and V
[4:07:32] <neroforte177> yo shout outs to the girl Leeandlie
[4:07:35] <Blank9> Wild Arms 2's openings are way better in english than japanese too, instrumentals with muted trumpets in place of vocals.
[4:07:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Drunkengen
[4:07:39] <+nabs2099> @klefth The literal guys who sang the song in English disagree with yiu
[4:07:40] <%nicversus> I will watch Dubs over subs most of the time, but english versions of OPs are rarely as good as the Japanese. One of the few examples IMO is the Yuyu Hakusho OP and EDs in English
[4:07:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Meanwhile I'm sitting here with my Brazilian OPs from the 90s and 2000s LUL
[4:07:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but V said Dub COVERS of the original OP
[4:07:46] <%Grimlockfly> Party500 have u tried new Dan hibiki?
[4:07:52] <laguerrilha> Yeah mentally you translate them in tone on your head
[4:07:52] <valriot> SASAAAGEYO, SASAAAAAGEYO
[4:07:53] <$QueequegTheater> BIT BY BIT I'M FALLING UNDER YOUR SPELL, YOUR SMILE IS ALL I NEED TO KNOW ALL WILL BE WELL
[4:07:56] <jorniev> last jojo op has an EN VERSION
[4:07:57] <+JustBlubs> DBZ does fun dub OPs
[4:07:59] <+Stormzcales_Lair> this is like how I see it
[4:08:00] <solracc25> Sasageyo Sasageyo
[4:08:04] <DemonDude656> DREAMIN DONT GIVE IT UP LUFFY
[4:08:07] <majindusto> SHE IS THE ONE NAMED SAILOR MOON! Wooo!!!
[4:08:08] <%Namillus> Yeah translating songs is even harder than just translating
[4:08:09] <VidulaSaix> Oh yeah absolutely
[4:08:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> most Dub OPs are not covers
[4:08:14] <PsychoPearl> I usually prefer the original
[4:08:15] <%Namillus> Meter and rhythm and rhyme
[4:08:17] <Safarihat> rave master's english op ravelution
[4:08:20] <aurasviel> @queequegtheater COME ALONG WITH MEEEEE, HOLD MY HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND
[4:08:22] <Qualityhugeweeb> @jorniev great days does too
[4:08:23] <+zzNamttamzz> Kingdom Hearts opening songs are better in English
[4:08:26] <%X2Eliah> You ain't listened to songs until you've heard the russian estrada covers
[4:08:32] <%jinking79> yeah i can only hear DB ost in Japanese
[4:08:32] <%OverlordLuna> i'd probably hate covers of The HU
[4:08:33] <+MajkirM> Anime in the 90s had Fire versiones in Spanish in M√©xico. The translation/adaptation was excellent. I have not encountered that in English.
[4:08:34] <308caliber> LUL
[4:08:36] <Deasmeister> A bit of variety is nice
[4:08:37] <@Solidus_113> Weight Of The World
[4:08:41] <VidulaSaix> @zzNamttamzz They arent covers though, they're sung by the same person
[4:08:44] <$QueequegTheater> I WANNA BE THE VERY BEST
[4:08:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there are Japanese covers of ENGLISH songs too
[4:08:45] <solracc25> Sailor moon good
[4:08:45] <CalciumTax> @QueequegTheater I rarely get to watch Woolie streams, who is this on the show with woolie? <3
[4:08:47] <exnuart> @zzNamttamzz utada does both english and jp versions
[4:08:48] <ForrestofFallenTrees> The spanish version of post malone's Rockstar in unusually better
[4:08:48] <$QueequegTheater> LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS
[4:08:58] <big_laser_boss> Euro beat remix
[4:08:59] <MayShip> i do that
[4:09:00] <$QueequegTheater> @CalciumTax LittleVMills, musician
[4:09:01] <Tham1k> samesame
[4:09:01] <GarbageNirvana> Or you could do what Daisuke Ishiwatari did and just write a banger in any language
[4:09:01] <Torgue_1> Watch as this part gets deleted from the VODs Kappa
[4:09:02] <jorniev> RIP the singers/voice actors of SPANISH DRAGONBALL BUB
[4:09:03] <laguerrilha> Yeahhhhh KH intro does sound better in eng
[4:09:07] <cheerfulbloke> Russian op of Aladdin is ze best
[4:09:08] <emmmdeekay> then the space jam version
[4:09:08] <CalciumTax> @QueequegTheater Thanks! <3
[4:09:09] <%jonblnt> @MajkirM i totally believe that
[4:09:11] <Tracazoid> The Kazoo version Kappa No but really some Kazoo covers are awesome
[4:09:13] <Nekros4442> Japanese Let It Go sounds wrong
[4:09:15] <Tardispardis> Gotta listen the nightcores
[4:09:24] <$QueequegTheater> Johnathan Young is fucking incredible
[4:09:30] <BlackermanZX> i search for piano versions StinkyGlitch
[4:09:30] <solracc25> Kingdom Hearts where the singer does both
[4:09:32] <+nabs2099> Jonathan young did good for JoJo stuff.
[4:09:34] <big_laser_boss> That one made by two Tesla coils
[4:09:36] <+OblivionSword1> Yeah Jonathan Young is SICK
[4:09:36] <Blank9> Burning Rangers english is hilarious
[4:09:48] <%X2Eliah> OH NO PIRACY
[4:09:57] <jorniev> DBZ OP IN SPANISH IS AMAZING
[4:10:03] <%ggbhtg> I've written a few English translated covers sajamMouse
[4:10:04] <%jinking79> he forgot the rest of part 4 lyrics but fuckit do it live
[4:10:05] <Qualityhugeweeb> The Kingdom Hearts english lyrics are kinda dumb though
[4:10:07] <Tham1k> John Piracy!
[4:10:09] <+nabs2099> pirating friends is GOOD
[4:10:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> masaaki Endoh did a cover of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers that is sick
[4:10:13] <$QueequegTheater> Does John know you broke into his home and stole his musics
[4:10:13] <Drunkengen> also Kamen Rider Kuuga
[4:10:17] <grouchio> @jorniev FUCK THAT
[4:10:19] <+TristonObv> Those arent the same. Music is an audio experience. Anime is an audio-visual medium, where the visuals are just as, if not more important
[4:10:20] <+loukemia83> Giving your friens a CD is not piracy MPAA fucks
[4:10:24] <thedudeinthered> Johnathan Young‚Äôs One Punch cover is a work of Gods
[4:10:25] <%ggbhtg> @qualityhugeweeb GOOD
[4:10:30] <%BlueJoneleth> Will next week be Y7 or Y0?

[4:12:13] <Qualityhugeweeb> Gaoranger, Hurricanger, and Kyoryuger are the best sentai OPs fight me
[4:12:15] <laguerrilha> Japanese matches best for this next part
[4:12:15] <+loukemia83> How far did they get today?
[4:12:17] <Tham1k> The worst thing
[4:12:22] <thedudeinthered> Happy birtbday to your lady, V

[4:13:14] <big_laser_boss> So we have one more week of me not spamming for the Quick-change clothes?
[4:13:14] <Qualityhugeweeb> Fair enough, Psychi Lover is the GOAT
