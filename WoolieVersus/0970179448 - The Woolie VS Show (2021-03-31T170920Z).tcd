[0:07:39] <%cache_22> Does anyone hear that whining sound? Kappa
[0:07:42] <OldManDeckardCain> it takes two... days to get this lp going
[0:07:46] <%krispen_wa> It takes Two: MARK TWO!
[0:07:47] <%ZweihanderSteve> bless woolie for his patience yesterday
[0:07:52] <Clundy> It Takes Two Takes
[0:08:08] <%cache_22> Seriously though, tech issues like that stink. I hope all is well now.
[0:08:42] <%ZweihanderSteve> D:
[0:08:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:08:51] <%krispen_wa> Woolie does not get thr Well-Rested EXP bonus
[0:08:55] <@Menitta> yay
[0:08:59] <%krispen_wa> GUILTY GEAR PACHINKO DEFEATED
[0:09:07] <%ZweihanderSteve> VESTEDGE DESTROYED
[0:09:15] <%RyTYoung> Did you guys play take two in the end?
[0:09:20] <%ZweihanderSteve> WOOLIE IS NOW A STORYTELLER
[0:09:20] <%krispen_wa> IMPORTANT PACHINKO LORE?!
[0:09:37] <+megadblitz> I hope more franchises make pachinko lore a thing
[0:09:40] <%Jiggisnipe> @RyTYoung naw, he played Ultrakill instead
[0:09:46] <%JustYudha> yay
[0:09:57] <%JustYudha> hopefully no problems this time
[0:10:02] <%cache_22> It's fitting that MGS3 music played right before the pachinko lore.
[0:10:04] <CursedNobleman> degenerates NotLikeThis
[0:10:17] <%ZweihanderSteve> playing the rev story was whack when i wiki dived ingame about the missing member. fucking pachinko
[0:10:45] <Tracazoid> "Sol, pull the lever!"
[0:10:47] <%ZweihanderSteve> Haha
[0:10:47] <NotHereToStream> sol: HIT THE LEVER
[0:11:14] <%ZweihanderSteve> sol about to take you the the HEAVY PACHINKO CEMETERY
[0:11:16] <MindlessMonks> Sup guys
[0:11:27] <@Menitta> yeyeye ghgostrunner
[0:11:56] <CursedNobleman> is woolie blind on disco elysium or has he played it before
[0:12:07] <%JaseAdrift> Disco Elysium probably deserves its own stream day
[0:12:08] <%ThisIsLloyd> tovgFrog
[0:12:11] <%krispen_wa> man, disco is so fucking good
[0:12:12] <%cache_22> I don't want to bring other channel's stuff here, but Pat's Disco Elysium start has me hyped even more for Woolie's playthrough.
[0:12:36] <Fleet_Admiral_Sakazuki> Finally made it to the actual live stream rather than the VOD
[0:12:43] <%Wahrow> Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:12:44] <%big_laser_boss> I guess my nagging about the Quick-change clothes has to wait.
[0:12:45] <jorniev> YES
[0:12:46] <%MaximumDaximum> MaximumDaximum subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Loving every LP lately, and GiFG is always awesome. Shout-out to Reggie's "I'm sorry!" in the DeS LP. Had me laughing like a mad man all day when I saw it.
[0:12:47] <%KoopaPrez> haha
[0:12:50] <%TheLakinessMonster> TheLakinessMonster subscribed with Prime. 
[0:12:58] <%johnny_gogo> i love ghost runner i just hate the in-between levels where its just puzzles
[0:13:07] <justcallmebobplease> You ABSOLUTELY should.
[0:13:07] <jorniev> WOOLY GETS into MGS3 PACHINKO
[0:13:08] <NotHereToStream> woolie vs japan 2: the pachinko visit
[0:13:10] <@Menitta> whaaaaaat
[0:13:12] <%KoopaPrez> The answer was YES
[0:13:15] <DSD24> Woolie is doing some Deep Sea Diving for lore
[0:13:15] <%krispen_wa> JAPANESE PHONE ACCOUNTS
[0:13:22] <%RyTYoung> @johnny_gogo my big gripe are the boss fights
[0:13:25] <Th3rd3> Gets into Pachislot and Gacha
[0:13:28] <%whymymore> shoutout to siegfang for the gifted sub woolieGASM
[0:13:33] <@Solidus_113> Jesus
[0:13:37] <aiutare47> Scrubbed from the history books
[0:13:42] <%KoopaPrez> Actual Pachinko Mining
[0:13:48] <jorniev> WOOLIE VS WORK
[0:13:51] <%johnny_gogo> @RyTYoung yeah they feel like they just take forever
[0:13:53] <%KoopaPrez> Scrublorded from the history books
[0:13:59] <%Wahrow> "Are you in or are you out?!"
[0:14:02] <Sternieliscious> I am still bummed that Yakuza 4 and 5 let you walk into the pachinko places, but the minigame was removed. I wanted to see what the appeal was.
[0:14:06] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus couldn't ArcSys give you access?
[0:14:10] <Darren716> Wait wouldn't ArcSys just have the pachinko stuff on file?
[0:14:27] <%krispen_wa> WHENS THE EPICSEVEN DIZZY LORE?!
[0:14:34] <%KoopaPrez> No musicals YET
[0:14:35] <+The_Death_Owl> time for a trip to Japan to collect footage
[0:14:39] <jorniev> How about song liryics!?
[0:14:48] <%cache_22> Nier had stage plays. I'm surprised GG did not.
[0:14:51] <DSD24> APA Sources
[0:14:57] <jorniev> READING THE SONG LYRICS!?
[0:15:03] <+megadblitz> DR. MADDEN
[0:15:04] <Equirah> YOu are, Guilty Gear Lore Keeper LUL
[0:15:04] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:15:07] <%KoopaPrez> Dr. Madden!!!
[0:15:08] <%ZweihanderSteve> Are you personally commissioning a translator or are they from Arcsys themselves?
[0:15:08] <DSD24> Can you cite sources if they no longer exist?
[0:15:08] <@Menitta> APA Citation lets go
[0:15:09] <aiutare47> PhD in guilty gear lore
[0:15:18] <%RyTYoung> You're gonna get a Merit in GG LUL
[0:15:23] <+megadblitz> peer reviewed by Dr. badguy
[0:15:26] <Solidnick18> hello
[0:15:31] <+The_Death_Owl> Arcsys should hire you as a lore consultant on future games
[0:15:47] <%KoopaPrez> In this thesis, Dr. Madden will describe the impact of pachinko on the future development of the latest Guilty Gear systems....
[0:15:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:15:50] <NotHereToStream> is woolie just essentially raven at this point
[0:15:50] <@Menitta> Oh yeah I saw what caused that poll
[0:15:51] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:16:05] <jorniev> oglaf....
[0:16:16] <%RyTYoung> Blindness wastes way more time and it is also partly overthinking
[0:16:28] <Th3rd3> Woolie now Daisuke right hand man
[0:16:30] <aiutare47> Woolie reads skeleton porn?
[0:16:51] <+kullumanati> Morning boys
[0:16:54] <%krispen_wa> Overblindness is the true killer
[0:16:57] <SomersaultJustice> it takes two... days to get the game working
[0:17:03] <%krispen_wa> NOW YOU'RE OVERTHINKING YOUR OVERTHINKING
[0:17:04] <+NoseFairActTune> Woolie! Hey Woolie! Have a great day Scrublord!!!
[0:17:23] <DatAsuna> But then both
[0:17:27] <DSD24> Trying to save time wastes time
[0:17:45] <Bigyanno> Riddler puzzles are 90% puns and I hate them
[0:18:08] <DSD24> @Bigyanno Are they punishing to find?
[0:18:19] <Bigyanno> No, they're just really bad puns
[0:18:37] <Prevot> I feel like woolie gives this exact explanation every couple of weeks
[0:18:51] <%Jiggisnipe> what was the poll?
[0:19:06] <Darren716> Is Woolie overthinking overthinking?
[0:19:07] <%krispen_wa> woolie and overexplaining himself, name a more iiconic duo
[0:19:20] <%krispen_wa> other than billie kay and peyton royce
[0:19:20] <@Menitta> Oh yeah in that case you can still say "oh I just didnt have that info. I am not stupid"
[0:19:36] <NotHereToStream> no kikongo
[0:19:38] <%krispen_wa> WOLBACHIA
[0:19:44] <%krispen_wa> MALE TO FEMALE COPULATION
[0:20:00] <MyNameIsRasus> okay i have a question: how many does it take?
[0:20:00] <andrewofbob> Is that a Miwako keychain in the background?
[0:20:12] <Bigyanno> METALLIC ARCHAEA
[0:20:13] <aiutare47> A puzzle to surpass metal gear?
[0:20:15] <andrewofbob> 13 Sentinels is on sale again btw
[0:20:15] <NotHereToStream> too bad im blind and dumb
[0:20:21] <%Jiggisnipe> dumb is worst
[0:20:21] <jayw888> What if you were not BOTH
[0:20:24] <+NoseFairActTune> anyone else's uptime clock in the negative...? am i watching a stream in the stopped time?
[0:20:25] <Sternieliscious> I'm thinking about the clue system in escape rooms to ask for help.
[0:20:30] <%KiwamiKiryu> I'm too stupid to play The Witness
[0:20:34] <+kullumanati> The universe will ruin Disco for you
[0:20:56] <andre11dr> Not really
[0:21:02] <%WutangchickeN> !uptime
[0:21:02] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 21 minutes and 13 seconds
[0:21:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does MGSV give you the answer if you don't figure it out on your own? Like what happens if you never get it?
[0:21:06] <PrideOfFiddles> Reggie hit the nail :)
[0:21:09] <puluxor> I believe people's "gazes" focus on different details
[0:21:12] <+MarkUriah> i get more annoyed not seeing something but i get depressed when i cant figure it out
[0:21:13] <MyNameIsRasus> if i don't see it i'll get mad at the game, if i don't figure it out i'll get mad at myself
[0:21:33] <@Solidus_113> being too dumb means you can see all the parts and eventually brute force the solution, but if you're not seeing something then you'll never move forward
[0:21:35] <aiutare47> Last I saw the poll was close to 50/50 which is cool
[0:21:46] <DSD24> I feel being dumb is worst
[0:21:47] <+tigerfang86> then it is what it is
[0:21:51] <MyNameIsRasus> wow
[0:21:56] <%Jiggisnipe> sounds like they are dumb Kappa
[0:22:06] <%KiwamiKiryu> It depends, is the answer as stupid as a Monkey Island riddle? then I usually don't feel dumb just frustrated
[0:22:06] <Bigyanno> I think it's more of "Well at least you're trying"
[0:22:06] <+MajorCrasher> always look up in 3d environments. it's just a rule at this point
[0:22:11] <SomersaultJustice> that's because it's more fun to watch someone be too dumb to figure it out than to keep missing something
[0:22:14] <johnnycripple10> blind Dark souls is a mess
[0:22:16] <+BisoromiBear> 54% wrong
[0:22:17] <Clundy> Dumb is a learning experience
[0:22:17] <Solidnick18> it's strange
[0:22:18] <TheRealDjcs124> Hi folks
[0:22:19] <+MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[0:22:20] <%johnny_gogo> yeah being dumb feels way worse
[0:22:22] <@Menitta> Being blind is worse in the sense that it's significantly harder to complete
[0:22:26] <+TheGenerousDon> sbfpGou sbfpGi sbfpGou sbfpGi sbfpGou sbfpGi
[0:22:28] <glass_marcus> watchin blind people is worse than watching dumb people; being dumb is worse than being blind
[0:22:29] <DSD24> Now Grandpa has his soul taken!
[0:22:30] <prime_name> I'd rather be dumb than be unable to see the little switch to progress
[0:22:31] <%ThisIsLloyd> cuz like personally if I'm too dumb for something I can just learn it and not be dumb anymore if I was too blind for it that's just me not paying enough attention or something something adhd and that's when it's like all my fault
[0:22:39] <+BigBruthaThunda> being blind  is annoying, but being too dumb at least you're engaging somehow
[0:22:40] <MyNameIsRasus> "don't blame me. blame yourself or god" vibes
[0:22:41] <jayw888> They may be approaching it from the context of streaming
[0:22:42] <%Jiggisnipe> I think being blind can also be being dumb in a way
[0:23:00] <jayw888> or watching someone else
[0:23:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000?s=19
[0:23:18] <+Awarets> i think some people perceive failing to see something as being a kind of dumb, due to not checking thoroughly enough or something
[0:23:19] <AngryAsian5> Blindness. I can appreciate someone who's dumb that tries. But I can't tell you how many times I've played a puzzle game and hated myself for not being able to figure it out because I didn't SEE the thing.
[0:23:20] <DSD24> @MyNameIsRasus That was Dileta's line from FF Tactics right?
[0:23:22] <%JustYudha> Maybe dumb people don't want to say dumb is worse because they're dumb?
[0:23:23] <segychan> i was promised mary kate and ashley
[0:23:25] <MyNameIsRasus> yup
[0:23:37] <MyNameIsRasus> such a raw line
[0:23:38] <DSD24> Its a good ass line
[0:23:40] <%ekodrop> i did the same thing as reggie
[0:23:45] <%Jiggisnipe> Reggie saw a shiny and ran off
[0:23:51] <%ekodrop> cause explore where you're not supposed to go first
[0:24:10] <%JaseAdrift> always explore the wrong direction first
[0:24:16] <Bigyanno> If the Tower part of the Hunter exam in HunterxHunter taught me anything it's that people tend to choose to go right when given 2 options of left and right
[0:24:23] <DSD24> @MyNameIsRasus Frederick from FE Awakening going "Pick a God and Pray!" is real similar line in terms of rawness
[0:24:34] <aiutare47> @bigyanno Most people are right handed
[0:24:34] <Louie_Salmon> Oh we're on the poll "blind" is way lamer, not even having the chance to try because you didn't happen to see the thing is worse
[0:24:42] <%krispen_wa> is this about woolie's Arkham playthrough?
[0:24:49] <NotHereToStream> if you really want to test your blindness and dumbness, do chess puzzles, you will feel dumb and blind when you miss the obvious
[0:25:10] <%Jiggisnipe> I didn't see the poll but maybe adding context (personal vs watching a streamer) would change answers
[0:25:13] <+MarkUriah> It's probably because the viewers are more concerned with you being blind than you being dumb maybe?
[0:25:14] <andrewofbob> Blindness can be fixed with more digging; dumb is hard to fix.
[0:25:21] <Louie_Salmon> Everyone's brains will latch onto the wrong thing in certain situations
[0:25:22] <+Silvermavrik> Every boss battle should just be a batarang to the face.
[0:25:27] <puluxor> Blindness probably seems like the more easily fixed problem to outside viewers
[0:25:30] <johnnycripple10> @andrewofbob true
[0:25:40] <%cubbywolf> woolieVS
[0:25:45] <@Menitta> that's why Ace Attorney is fucking great
[0:25:49] <eldragon_1> A lot of people just look up the solutions to puzzles in games, so they dont care about being dumb. But realizing that the answer was obvious and they were being blind does feel bad.
[0:25:50] <masterfire23> is this gonna be a salt party?
[0:26:01] <+Kalixas> Maybe
[0:26:06] <MyNameIsRasus> the witness can be such a fuck at points
[0:26:08] <DSD24> See with eyes unclouded by hate
[0:26:09] <%MajkirM> I think it's a matter of "I don't know if this is my fault or the game's" VS. "this is on me, I gotta get there at some point".
[0:26:10] <AShinyVagikarp> SoL
[0:26:18] <DedlokPM> I have been playing Control for the first time last night and ran into an ID Card puzzle that was deductive
[0:26:29] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Portal 2 had the issue of timing that I didn’t like
[0:26:31] <Bigyanno> I think blindness would both be more of and less of a problem in later Arkham games. There are a lot of optional sidequests and puzzles that are very easy to miss but the main story stuff is usually pretty obvious, especially in city
[0:26:40] <%krispen_wa> woolie having a different mindset from most people? no waaaaay
[0:26:42] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:26:44] <DSD24> It takes two!
[0:26:52] <%KoopaPrez> And on THAT NOTE
[0:26:56] <%jonblnt> nothing can go wrong famous last words
[0:26:58] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus Did you see googlygarath remade the Yakuza bread with Gordan Freeman?
[0:27:00] <%Jiggisnipe> though I can understand how blindness would be worse since it's easily fixable and just requires paying more attention
[0:27:03] <MyNameIsRasus> incoming woolie vs final in like 30 minutes
[0:27:06] <Prevot> oh my god that whole thing was pregame johns LUL
[0:27:06] <+blaze__drag> it really depends on how blind you are
[0:27:09] <bevyrage> we can still see you guys?
[0:27:13] <mankeymania> nothing can go "right" you mean
[0:27:15] <Nocturnment> the Witness is great just got it with the play at home thing
[0:27:16] <+TheGenerousDon> sbfpGreen
[0:27:18] <CraZ80> It Takes Two. Take two.
[0:27:23] <%Areus> Areus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! ravageBig ravageRig ravageRig ravageRig
[0:27:23] <+BigBruthaThunda> imagine it starts buzzing
[0:27:29] <aiutare47> Boy howdy I can’t wait for these folks to play an extremely well written game that is based around using deductive reasoning to piece together a mystery even with the possibility of missing vital information.
[0:27:32] <puluxor> So we on console now?
[0:27:32] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Yous ever play A Way Out? Yous would love it it’s sooo bad but awesome perfect coop game

[0:27:41] <+The_Death_Owl> are Woolie and Reggie getting a divorce TearGlove
[0:27:43] <+MTLxSpider> lmao
[0:27:44] <+blaze__drag> if it was something obvious like a button prompt on screen you just didn't notice, then I feel stupid, but if it was something obscure hidden by darkness that the game did a poor job of showing you, then it's on the game
[0:27:49] <%smyld> Dammit @craz80 I was just thinking that
[0:27:56] <puluxor> make a dream come true
[0:27:56] <%krispen_wa> @awkwardl0ser pat and him did a playthrough
[0:27:57] <+Silvermavrik> “Nothing can go wrong” boss starts to shoulder tackle.
[0:28:07] <%DkLordG> You are about to be possessed
[0:28:07] <Sporkgasm> PogChamp
[0:28:13] <Kyderra> whow, am I exactly in time for this?!

[3:47:44] <%guyalex> remake is great
[3:47:45] <@Menitta> they;re different games
[3:47:45] <$eco419> qynoaDab NTR ft Reggie
[3:47:45] <Asuterisuku> Just play the remake.
[3:47:46] <+ALazo> RE@R is excellent

[3:47:49] <prime_name> Remake is great
[3:47:49] <QuietSandshrew> ALL GOOD
[3:47:49] <@Menitta> but the remake is fantastic
[3:47:50] <DatAsuna> Old one has a lot of different stuff
[3:47:50] <ManlyMcBeefington> Natural True Romance?
[3:47:52] <dds333a> It's possible to screw yourself, although not as easily in the earlier games. Code Veronica, much easier to screw yourself
[3:47:57] <fritz_dacat> Remake is faithful, its pat apporved
[3:47:57] <%jonblnt> do you think the marriage will last?
[3:47:58] <dukenux> RE2R is great
[3:48:02] <FrostedZaibatsu> RE2 remake is fun
[3:48:02] <+Dio_Goodguy> they are both different enough, old one is still great
[3:48:04] <CoffeeSlice> End of Zoe is basically an episode of get into fighting games
[3:48:06] <DatAsuna> Just play Darkside Chronicles RE2 story :P
[3:48:12] <+ALazo> RE3R is less great, but still good
[3:48:13] <justcallmebobplease> Yeah but RE2R is one of those games well suited to letting people watch your blind playthrough.
[3:48:13] <$QueequegTheater> Not if Reggie has any say
[3:48:19] <Jaysky> Just make the kid cry
[3:48:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FeelsBadMan
[3:48:24] <dds333a> Also, Netori is patrician
[3:48:25] <+toastybites> real talk
[3:48:29] <aiutare47> @jonblnt It shouldn’t. If it does I’ll think it’s a writing cop out
[3:48:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> man........
[3:48:30] <reonome> FeelsBadMan
[3:48:35] <%jonblnt> good answer i agree
[3:48:35] <%barbatolover> onion tears allowed?
[3:48:37] <QuietSandshrew> chairSteeb
[3:48:38] <%illtima> Don't forget that it's April 1st, so Japanese devs are doing some wacky shit. A mobile iDOLM@STER game collabed with Tekken team and made an idol fighting game with Tekken animations
[3:48:44] <+MugenSandan> Make sure the kid knows it's all their fault
[3:48:49] <reonome> just punch the kid
[3:48:50] <$eco419> BibleThump

[3:49:16] <reonome> REGGIE mgtow confirmed
[3:49:18] <dds333a> Unfortunately
[3:49:19] <QuietSandshrew> BIG TRUE
[3:49:20] <$QueequegTheater> Reggies Going Their Own Way
[3:49:24] <+MajorCrasher> go you own way LUL
[3:49:27] <dds333a> it's just how it is
[3:49:32] <%Irridium> shoutout to that one Persona 3 link where you can tell the girl it's her fault her parents are fighting
[3:49:32] <Jaysky> If you had to use either a fork or a spoon as a weapon against a wasp, which would you choose?
[3:49:34] <%jonblnt> the game is about learning how to co-parent
[3:49:36] <aiutare47> Honestly yeah. If it ain’t healthy, dip out.
[3:49:37] <+babyacid> Wait...Reggie...Unsupervised??"
[3:49:44] <Qsmash_> divorce doesn't have to be sad if both people agree it isn't working
[3:49:44] <$QueequegTheater> Nobody mentioned diapers but you, Reggie
[3:49:50] <$eco419> LUL
[3:49:54] <dds333a> If they don't, then you're not actually close

[3:50:09] <KaiserMario> Yeah, even if your like... Super best friends or something...
[3:50:10] <aiutare47> Reggie are you trying to tell us something?
[3:50:12] <justcallmebobplease> WOOLIE he added vore to his lore while you were out!
[3:50:22] <QuietSandshrew> We are still great friends, just differences
[3:50:22] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Reggie got some new fetish lore
[3:50:23] <%nicversus> nicversus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Woolie and Reggie, you guys rule! Woolz sorry that website for Boss Coffee didn't ship to Quebec! The site said "canada wide shipping," so I thought I was being cool for senpai.
[3:50:26] <Siconia> this place built different
[3:50:33] <Jaysky> Vore lore

[3:50:42] <justcallmebobplease> Reggie got some vore lore now!
[3:50:44] <%jonblnt> the game is about learning how to co-parent
[3:50:48] <Jaysky> @ekodrop Sounds nasty
[3:50:50] <%Jiggisnipe> Bill Dipperly
[3:50:51] <$QueequegTheater> Reggie is into vore and broken marriages
[3:50:53] <Klefth> HEAT-UP
[3:50:53] <reonome> its just built different
[3:50:55] <%jonblnt> VORE LORE
[3:50:55] <%Irridium> Vore lore rolls of the tongue quite nice
[3:51:03] <%WutangchickeN> is your home haunted by DIVORCE GHOST DOLLS???
[3:51:04] <prime_name> oh no
[3:51:06] <Darren716> LUL
[3:51:07] <$eco419> LUL
[3:51:07] <DatAsuna> That sucks
[3:51:08] <RWLJr98> sucks
[3:51:09] <brunoberserk> Woolie's house is like that film '' the cube ''
[3:51:10] <aiutare47> Oof
[3:51:11] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Hey I checked to make sure FEXL: Another Dash coming to the west April 15

[3:51:26] <JeysJumbleJams> open all windows? wear a sheet of ice?
[3:51:38] <+babyacid> im SO sad its 11pm here.
[3:51:40] <%WutangchickeN> QUEBEC USNT CANADA
[3:52:00] <DatAsuna> but actually fuck quebec
[3:52:01] <Jaysky> It is though
[3:52:03] <Asuterisuku> So many places that ship to Canada exclude Quebec and it's bizarre.
[3:52:03] <Siconia> We got boss coffee here in Australia, it's like $4 a can
[3:52:10] <%ekodrop> georgia max coffee is better though
[3:52:15] <Asuterisuku> And probably has more to do with quebec than anything else.
[3:52:15] <$eco419> oof
[3:52:16] <%jonblnt> nobody want's to deal with QUBEC
[3:52:23] <%KetsuoTaberu> yeah, Quebec has strange giveaway laws
[3:52:28] <Asuterisuku> Fuck the Bloc.
[3:52:30] <%Proxzo> Do you have a local japanese super market?
[3:52:32] <aiutare47> The mob?
[3:52:33] <MyNameIsRasus> you guys are just built different
[3:52:35] <CoffeeSlice> what
[3:52:44] <%Jiggisnipe> very anti gambling
[3:52:46] <%nicversus> What's annoying is that their shipping policy SAYS they have flat rate shipping for Quebec
[3:52:47] <RWLJr98> Woolie lives in Quebec? i'm sorry
[3:52:49] <%wibbwobbler> and it's law?
[3:53:14] <Jaysky> A friend of mine wants to move to Quebec
[3:53:23] <axelkaspar> Imagine living in Switzerland
[3:53:29] <cheerfulbloke> wooliePOYO_RB
[3:53:34] <axelkaspar> trilingual packaging
[3:53:37] <%ekodrop> why would y'all shit on the rest of canada then
[3:53:37] <RWLJr98> both a curse and bl;essing
[3:53:38] <Asuterisuku> Even in Ontario most stuff has to have both English and French on it.
[3:53:45] <%jonblnt> movie's filmed in Quebec
[3:53:46] <pmda2126> that sucks
[3:53:46] <aiutare47> What its all president’s choice?
[3:53:52] <33phy33> hello woolie
[3:54:03] <dds333a> @aiutare47 much deeper than that
[3:54:12] <+ColonelHandzLanza> Stick on the French
[3:54:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:54:19] <@Solidus_113> run with some ghosts
[3:54:19] <Siconia> No sticky French
[3:54:24] <%jonblnt> part 2
[3:54:26] <%barbatolover> ohh
[3:54:26] <dds333a> It all has to do with regions, zoning and whatnot
[3:54:30] <%barbatolover> nani
[3:54:30] <andrewofbob> Sounds like Wales
[3:54:36] <T_Sasquatch> no disco elysium NotLikeThis
[3:54:38] <%FallenAngelSC2> @WoolieVersus Regarth vs Bloodborne when?
[3:54:40] <33phy33> whats the stream about
[3:54:41] <aiutare47> @dds333a I haven’t spent much time in Montreal but all the soda in Ottawa was presidents choice
[3:54:49] <dds333a> Ghostrunner time
[3:54:52] <Asuterisuku> Couch Co-op on PC, by the way, isn't that wild?
[3:54:57] <%jonblnt> i was surprised in a good way
[3:54:58] <T_Sasquatch> because coop is less sales
[3:55:00] <pmda2126> online
[3:55:02] <justcallmebobplease> I feel like Co-op's become an artform, nowadays.
[3:55:03] <prime_name> Online
[3:55:05] <%barbatolover> I really miss it.
[3:55:06] <+ColonelHandzLanza> PVP is easier as well\
[3:55:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> and Coop RULES
[3:55:07] <DatAsuna> Halo getting rid of splitscreen ruined family christmas, true story
[3:55:09] <dds333a> @aiutare47 ah, I wasn't aware
[3:55:11] <%Zero_Jacks> couch = Parsec
[3:55:11] <andrewofbob> Looking forward to Back 4 Blood
[3:55:11] <$eco419> true
[3:55:21] <Jaysky> PSO was nice
[3:55:21] <T_Sasquatch> its just a smaller demographic
[3:55:21] <@Solidus_113> Borderlands was one of the only games still pushing local coop
[3:55:27] <%jonblnt> the gaming community got older with less time to game locally
[3:55:27] <BlackermanZX> i really enjoy co op games
[3:55:34] <dds333a> Playing trivial pursuit
[3:55:35] <haisho> speaking of which, praying for that new Dokapon to get a western release
[3:55:36] <BlackermanZX> RE5 co op is till one of my favorites
[3:55:37] <masterfire23> I enjoyed playing the Lego games with my siblings
[3:55:48] <+Navekraith> Anyone remember Army of Two?
[3:55:49] <@Menitta> beat em ups are coming back
[3:55:53] <%jonblnt> i wish i had some one to play with

[3:55:58] <+TenKaiHunter> Dokapon to the west please
[3:56:00] <%TubeMan642> Me and My brother would would spend hours doing Coop Splinter Cell Missions
[3:56:01] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus Because they insits on being exclusively couch co-op or online co-op and never offer you both

[4:03:32] <ARDM112> Didn't Woolie show off this game years ago back when the channel was still a thing?
[4:03:35] <@Menitta> Now you're about to learn how amazing basic enemies are in this game
[4:03:36] <+LeaIsChill> This game's bit rate shit's the bed anytime it's in motion on stream LUL
[4:03:46] <T_Sasquatch> IT BEGINS
[4:03:50] <%nicversus> so it's like a cyberpunk ninja mirror's edge hotline miami
[4:04:00] <dds333a> Yup, always moving, really
[4:04:12] <+trackles_64> twitch sets the stream at 420p why?
[4:04:12] <%barbatolover> is there a pc version?
[4:04:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @nicversus exactly
[4:04:18] <@Menitta> there is a PC version
[4:04:18] <+OblivionSword1> yes
[4:04:21] <$eco419> square to apply
[4:04:22] <Asuterisuku> So I guess V's busy with something else today?
[4:04:28] <%nicversus> @cobalt_phoenix_ that's dope
[4:04:38] <+LeaIsChill> It's on both Steam and EG now I think. Used to be EG only
[4:04:45] <+trackles_64> is this hard mode?
[4:04:45] <%jonblnt> how does the game feel
[4:04:54] <CoffeeSlice> Kappa
[4:04:55] <@Solidus_113> hybrid time
[4:04:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> time to break out the hybrid setup
[4:04:56] <+LeaIsChill> 100% LUL
[4:04:56] <@Solidus_113> yes
[4:04:59] <Asuterisuku> It launched on Steam.
[4:04:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YES
[4:05:01] <%barbatolover> yea
[4:05:01] <%KetsuoTaberu> yep
[4:05:02] <%Jiggisnipe> yea
[4:05:03] <@Menitta> It is much much harder on PS4
[4:05:03] <+babyacid> Kitano Zero in 3D
[4:05:04] <T_Sasquatch> lool the game is very cool but actually playing it requires ALOT OF PRACTICE
[4:05:05] <+ShutUpAceyP> its HYBRID TIME!
[4:05:05] <notorious_rng> every shooter is
[4:05:09] <BlackermanZX> hybrid time doodNuts
[4:05:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> either hybrid or c u b e
[4:05:26] <T_Sasquatch> Its still doable but it can get rough
[4:05:27] <andrewofbob> Are we reviving the cube?
[4:05:28] <%Irridium> time for C U B E
[4:05:29] <%big_laser_boss> Nice
[4:05:29] <%Jiggisnipe> pull the cube for HYBRID
[4:05:29] <+LeaIsChill> Is there any way to improve bit rate in this sort of game?
[4:05:31] <$eco419> im pretty sure you are still on 50
[4:05:33] <+OblivionSword1> Is it time for THE CUBE?
[4:05:36] <Klefth> Cube up
[4:05:42] <@Menitta> Its doable with controller but it is harder
[4:05:47] <T_Sasquatch> it needs a wider fov also
[4:05:49] <+babyacid> effing auto bollocks...katana zero in 3D
[4:05:49] <@Menitta> I beat it on PS4
[4:05:56] <+Smack_Punk> its like doom eternal you need a keyboard and mouse to do sick stuff
[4:05:57] <+LeaIsChill> LUL
[4:05:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's hard enough on mkb i can't imagine doing this on controller
[4:06:05] <+ShutUpAceyP> is this 3d katana zero?
[4:06:08] <@Solidus_113> yes
[4:06:12] <+babyacid> YES
[4:06:15] <Asuterisuku> This is one of those games where if you're touching the ground you've done something wrong.
[4:06:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> big props to anyone who can do this on controller
[4:06:21] <@Solidus_113> everyone gets one hit
[4:06:25] <Klefth> It's like Katana Zero meets Mirror's Edge
[4:06:40] <masterfire23> I wonder if you can bhop for extra movement speed
[4:06:48] <+trackles_64> timing basically
[4:06:48] <+ShutUpAceyP> Katana's Edge
[4:06:48] <agustorm123> Real Ninjas use M&K
[4:06:50] <+LeaIsChill> Uh huh
[4:06:51] <T_Sasquatch> they have auto aim so its dodge then kill
[4:06:52] <andrewofbob> It looks like there’s zero aim assist
[4:06:53] <+ShutUpAceyP> Mirror Zero
[4:06:54] <Equirah> chat it's okay, just say you have no idea what technoir is LUL
[4:06:56] <+babyacid> yas. katana zero v mirros edge
[4:07:08] <brunoberserk> the game is really FAST
[4:07:10] <dds333a> @ardm112 you might be thinking of Ruiner
[4:07:13] <%Jiggisnipe> make it 5 ;p;
[4:07:57] <CoffeeSlice> HOOCHA!
[4:08:03] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah this looks like a mouse game
[4:08:14] <BlackermanZX> the instant respawn is very appreciated
[4:08:25] <dds333a> Gotta get back, back to the past
[4:08:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000
[4:08:34] <@Menitta> they definitely expect you to die a lot
[4:08:35] <T_Sasquatch> this is why i couldnt justify buying the game despite being very cool its gets frustrating
[4:08:44] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[4:08:49] <$eco419> LUL LUL LUL
[4:08:59] <@Menitta> At first you can only block incoming bullets
[4:09:02] <dds333a> Good shit, he's learning
[4:09:02] <diddlydaddlydoo> im bouta get my artesian pc build sent in!!! god its so much more efficient than searching for parts myself thesph1SUZIyell
[4:09:06] <masterfire23> haven't gotten to the annoying enemies yet
[4:09:07] <BlackermanZX> i mean you are not a techo ninja if you can't deflect bullets doodNuts
[4:09:22] <+badjab326> it's really not that hard after you get used to it lol
[4:09:27] <crimsonsaens> The slow-mo mechanic is what stopped me from getting the game
[4:09:29] <MyNameIsRasus> it's almost as hard as fighting someone with a gun using a sword
[4:09:35] <KaiserMario> Maybe pratice yhe parry while standing still first, so you get the hang of it?
[4:09:35] <$eco419> yaaaaay
[4:09:40] <EternalJedi> diddlydaddlydoo I ordered from them a few weeks ago rooAww did they email you when yours came up on their build streams?
[4:09:47] <Darren716> Why doesn't the ninja guy use a gun also?
[4:10:01] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:10:07] <CoffeeSlice> not only that
[4:10:07] <@Menitta> Whats nice is that the game is incredibly generous with checkpoints. I;ve died immediately after killing every enemy in a room and it still counted
[4:10:09] <Equirah> "this part's fine" LUL
[4:10:11] <dds333a> jumps too apparently
[4:10:16] <derap41> This is the combat Cyberpunk wish it had
[4:10:17] <Darren716> LUL
[4:10:24] <diddlydaddlydoo> @EternalJedi nah i meant im buying it today lol. cant wait to see it get built though!
[4:10:38] <EternalJedi> diddlydaddlydoo ah gotcha rooHappy
[4:10:57] <Asuterisuku> VERY KB+M centric controls.
[4:11:16] <andrewofbob> Stand on negative edge
[4:11:19] <@Solidus_113> the first real skill test room
[4:11:19] <dds333a> Yeah, that's fine. this is where you're gonna be doing this stuff
[4:11:21] <%gatorafan> No problem, I'm vibin here catJAM
[4:11:31] <@Menitta> woah
[4:11:37] <dds333a> no look
[4:11:50] <EternalJedi> diddlydaddlydoo do you know if they do notify you when it comes up on stream, though? I thought I read that somewhere along the line but can't refind it
[4:12:09] <%jonblnt> very souls
[4:12:11] <@Menitta> there are different control schemes. I set it to be as close to Titanfall as possible
[4:12:13] <Asuterisuku> That's exactly the reason.
[4:12:16] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[4:12:18] <T_Sasquatch> man that map its near worthless because its in the corner
[4:12:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Change controls man, bumper jumper stinks

[4:13:44] <@Menitta> Checkpoints are GENEROUS AF
[4:13:46] <+babyacid> hahahahahhaa
[4:13:48] <masterfire23> that deflect was sick
[4:13:48] <@Solidus_113> C U B E
[4:13:48] <Equirah> never change Woolie LUL
[4:13:51] <%jonblnt> nice death at the end
[4:13:53] <T_Sasquatch> you managed to deflect that out of luck
[4:13:54] <QuietSandshrew> And DONE
[4:13:57] <%barbatolover> will take time
[4:13:58] <Darren716> Get the cube
[4:14:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You can change control scheme
[4:14:01] <andrewofbob> Speedrun dead
[4:14:04] <T_Sasquatch> its fine, its rough
[4:14:09] <Darren716> >47
[4:14:10] <QuietSandshrew> Incredible
[4:14:11] <theanora1> You'd think at some point your character would pick up a gun
[4:14:11] <diddlydaddlydoo> @EternalJedi well the website does say they send you a notification for it within 3 to 4 weeks
[4:14:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> IT'S TIME
[4:14:14] <+toficque> I don't even understand what is happening on the screen :D

[4:14:59] <Schizocyte> See about swapping up controller scheme first!
[4:14:59] <Asuterisuku> I don't understand what's so blasphemous about having a controller in one hand and a mouse in the other.
[4:15:01] <DedlokPM> Oh god... Is he bringing out that 3rd party half controller with mouth monster
[4:15:03] <+kullumanati> Do it coward

[4:15:20] <+kullumanati> The mice controller
[4:15:21] <Agent_Sampson> Dew it boxyfrSITHH
[4:15:26] <@Menitta> It should work on PS5 since the game is PS4

[4:16:16] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[4:16:17] <%gatorafan> This week keeps on giving huh?
[4:16:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what a week man
[4:16:26] <Asuterisuku> It is, in fact on Steam.
[4:16:29] <%Irridium> @shootbang_exe installing on PC and using his Special Mouse Setup™
[4:16:30] <+kullumanati> Become abomination
[4:16:30] <+red_cuppa> omg
[4:16:38] <haisho> I would be annoyed at busting out control abominations if not for the fact that I've done the same for certain games
[4:16:39] <a_mad_dragon_> just buy every version of every game you get 4Head
[4:16:41] <Asuterisuku> Already owns it.
[4:16:45] <haisho> so do eet
[4:16:48] <%TubeMan642> Wait you were playing this on console?
[4:16:50] <+shootbang_exe> oh no
[4:16:55] <%TubeMan642> You poor fool
[4:17:10] <dds333a> Frankenstein mechanics
[4:17:14] <Asuterisuku> Mouse is the best way.
[4:17:14] <T_Sasquatch> keyboard and mouse works on ps4tho
[4:17:16] <andrewofbob> Woolie also buys games on steam and forgets them
[4:17:16] <+trackles_64> or woolie git gud as they say
[4:17:18] <justcallmebobplease> THE WOOLIE WAY
[4:17:21] <justcallmebobplease> It is time!
[4:17:53] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> here is the lime, here is the coconut
[4:17:53] <dds333a> Actually not bad
[4:17:56] <+trackles_64> Put the lime in the coconut and shake it all about
[4:17:57] <aiutare47> I never really understood, can Woolie not use a MnK?
[4:18:13] <Schizocyte> Get this man a wii nunchuck
[4:18:13] <Darren716> aiutare47 He refuses to use keyboard
[4:18:14] <%gatorafan> Limeade? More like, LAMEade! Kappa
[4:18:16] <@Solidus_113> he doesn't like the feel of a keyboard for games
[4:18:18] <%barbatolover> the badass strap
[4:18:27] <Blank9> take it off and throw it at your tv like a wiimote
[4:18:27] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> this is way more interesting that using m+kb
[4:18:31] <diddlydaddlydoo> woolie putting on the strap
[4:18:33] <%cubbywolf> gross
[4:18:33] <Darren716> THE FUCK
[4:18:39] <Equirah> it's so you don't have to keep a hard grip on it on all times and can relax, otherwise rip your tendons
[4:18:41] <aiutare47> @darren716 Yeah I’ve noticed but why? He uses them for a living.
[4:18:42] <DedlokPM> https://clips.twitch.tv/StupidHelplessDragonVoteNay-b2Xq4LDxz8DpWtm5
[4:18:43] <Agent_Sampson> .....
[4:18:43] <T_Sasquatch> Woolie : I'll put the strapon
[4:18:45] <Asuterisuku> A keyboard is a hitbox with more buttons. But that isn't the greatest solution for 3D movement.
[4:18:46] <@Menitta> Oh god that thing isnt gonna even work on PS4
[4:18:47] <+kullumanati> Safety disclaimer
[4:18:48] <%kewlmyc> I think I'm going to throw up.
[4:18:51] <@Menitta> Ghostrunner
[4:18:53] <+kullumanati> Before you play
[4:18:53] <+shoryukenabotch> lytPATHETIC lytPATHETIC lytPATHETIC lytPATHETIC lytPATHETIC lytPATHETIC lytPATHETIC
[4:18:54] <BlackermanZX> remember chit woolie is in the mirror world
[4:18:55] <%cubbywolf> so nasty
[4:19:04] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> i'm so excited i'm so scared
[4:19:11] <+kullumanati> I just threw up
[4:19:12] <%gatorafan> I hope the mouse comes with a keyoboard
[4:19:12] <DatAsuna> i need a new gamer mouse tbh
[4:19:14] <%gatorafan> awww
[4:19:17] <Equirah> @Menitta it's made specifically for the ps4 so,,,,,
[4:19:18] <Agent_Sampson> That's a GREAT question
[4:19:19] <Darren716> Will this even work on ps5?
[4:19:21] <andrewofbob> Is it an MMO pad?
[4:19:24] <%Jiggisnipe> watch this be horrible cuz he never used it LUL
[4:19:25] <Asuterisuku> How many buttons does your mouse have?
[4:19:27] <+OblivionSword1> oh man oh boy this is going to be a dumpster fire
[4:19:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You can change control scheme woolie
[4:19:31] <@Menitta> there are alternate control schemes in the game. Maybe those will work better
[4:19:33] <%kewlmyc> "Keyboards are too confusing"
[4:19:42] <%Livelinne> psaBlind
[4:19:42] <dds333a> Fortune favors the bold
[4:19:42] <masterfire23> I am so curious
[4:19:46] <T_Sasquatch> WASD sucks
[4:19:46] <Schizocyte> Woolie please try alternate control schemes on the controller
[4:19:46] <@Menitta> @Equirah I meant Ghostrunner specifically. That game has some weird control schemes
[4:19:48] <+trackles_64> Good thing woolie doenst have an MMO mouse
[4:19:52] <%gatorafan> Woolie is about to kill the bit live daedra1DerpyTibs
[4:19:58] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> trailblazers, boldly going
[4:19:59] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus wouldn't you want those to be flipped? LUL
[4:19:59] <@Menitta> At least on PS4 it does
[4:20:05] <aiutare47> His work requires computers, how can he not just use a keyboard?
[4:20:08] <Equirah> is woolie left-handed?
[4:20:13] <justcallmebobplease> For all I still think Woolie's insane with his controller foibles, this is a fascinating bit of 'okay but how does the game handle it if I do THIS'
[4:20:24] <%Jiggisnipe> @aiutare47 cuz playing a game is different than work?
[4:20:35] <%cubbywolf> is that a razer mouse?
[4:20:36] <Asuterisuku> If you don't want your left index finger doing all the work you'll want to rebind your mouse buttons.
[4:20:41] <Schizocyte> What if this works and Woolie becomes too powerful
[4:20:51] <+red_cuppa> omg
[4:20:53] <+OblivionSword1> @aiutare47 you're underestimating how stubborn Woolie is
[4:20:54] <DatAsuna> Well it's called an MMO config for a reason
[4:20:55] <%Irridium> oh no
[4:20:56] <T_Sasquatch> ITS ALIVEEEEEE
[4:21:00] <aiutare47> @jiggisnipe I guess. I’ve used a keyboard and never thought anything of it. It’s just second nature
[4:21:02] <DatAsuna> Who is this other woolz?
[4:21:05] <BlackermanZX> gotta test the limits of human sanity
[4:21:05] <dds333a> hello gentleman
[4:21:08] <%Livelinne> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[4:21:10] <%kewlmyc> MOM, I'M SCARED
[4:21:11] <Darren716> I hate thid
[4:21:12] <Darren716> this
[4:21:13] <@Menitta> you can replay the first level
[4:21:16] <T_Sasquatch> UNLIMITED POWAHHHH
[4:21:17] <@Solidus_113> ! CURSED !

[4:23:26] <justcallmebobplease> I want to see a game put a 'Woolie way' controller binding that defaults to hybrid.

[4:24:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god imagine this in vr
[4:25:01] <Asuterisuku> Pad is VERY not recommended for this game.
[4:25:01] <T_Sasquatch> THIS isi where woolie will know pain

[4:57:31] <%cubbywolf> music nah we silent ninjas
[4:57:36] <Lancaster_H> @Menitta they didnt think it would take players this long to get through
[4:57:43] <$eco419> Is that like dead 200 ?
[4:57:44] <Johannen> @Menitta Music ended...it was not expecting that this would continue for this long
[4:57:50] <MyNameIsRasus> If this gets cut from the LP you're a coward
[4:57:50] <superchunk121> Its so weird theirs no music here
[4:57:54] <MOON__MIST> is there a death counter?
[4:57:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:57:54] <dds333a> I don't remember there being music in this segment, actually, but I'm not sure
[4:57:56] <%jonblnt> feel it out
[4:57:58] <%cubbywolf> most people get a refund if they cant beat the tutorials
[4:57:59] <+Cuon_Alpinus> you can also just go straight up the grappling hook too
[4:58:00] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus how0s that pc download going? LUL
[4:58:01] <Johannen> @Lancaster_H Nice one)
[4:58:05] <@Menitta> but it looks lmao

[4:58:08] <Darren716> DId the enemies just go home?
[4:58:10] <@Menitta> loops*

[4:58:21] <%Tuna_Can_0> when's the portal 2 stream? atpRtsd
[4:58:31] <Space_Pagan> too much slide LUL
[4:58:33] <Lancaster_H> @Tuna_Can_0 oh god dont
[4:58:34] <dds333a> Woolie should just play on instinct, clearly
[4:58:41] <%cubbywolf> gotta aim where you jumpin
[4:58:42] <pmda2126> 😂
[4:58:42] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[4:58:48] <+djinnJuice> Hmmmmm
[4:58:55] <pmda2126> yeah except for her
[4:58:59] <%cubbywolf> aimed too low
[4:59:01] <T_Sasquatch> Man the music just gave up
[4:59:12] <%hax_metatron> This game looks ... bad
[4:59:13] <@Menitta> this sucks the music is so good damnit
[4:59:19] <%cubbywolf> gotta aim higher so momentum carries you
[4:59:22] <@Menitta> This is still early in the level too!
[4:59:25] <Johannen> Is it possible to dash without the slow mo?
[4:59:27] <%nicversus> I love his resigned little death grunt
[4:59:28] <MyNameIsRasus> Wait is the music bugged?
[4:59:29] <justcallmebobplease> Is there literally any time a gravelly voice said 'trust me', and they actually deserved trust?
[4:59:30] <%Tuna_Can_0> @Lancaster_H at least there's no wall running, just semi precise portal shootin
[4:59:30] <@Menitta> I think this is a bug
[4:59:32] <SPWATHY> Damn, they nerfed Genji's mobility into the ground lol...
[4:59:33] <T_Sasquatch> @hax_metatron its really not, its rough to get used to but its a good game
[4:59:35] <superchunk121> No
[4:59:35] <%gatorafan> Wait for real? I thought there wasn't supposed to be music here.
[4:59:36] <Space_Pagan> where's the music? D:
[4:59:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> No
[4:59:37] <$eco419> Totally you
[4:59:37] <%gatorafan> waow
[4:59:40] <Meltgar> Not yet
[4:59:41] <%cubbywolf> higher build it higher
[4:59:43] <moonmintparadise> woolie died so much it broke the music
[4:59:43] <%nicversus> maybe the mouse took away the musid
[4:59:50] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @Johannen yes, you have to hold the button to keep slomo on, so if you just tap, it doesnt slomo
[4:59:51] <Lancaster_H> @Tuna_Can_0 id be more concerned about the overthinking
[4:59:57] <@Menitta> there SHOULD be music
[4:59:58] <justcallmebobplease> You took too long Woolie
[5:00:02] <Darren716> It's like DMC 5 music
[5:00:04] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:00:05] <$eco419> The game gave up on you so lno music Kappa
[5:00:05] <justcallmebobplease> Music got bored waiting for you
[5:00:06] <%nicversus> the music got tired of Woolie's hubris
[5:00:09] <%Tuna_Can_0> @Lancaster_H oh yea LOL atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[5:00:10] <T_Sasquatch> you bugged out Kappa
[5:00:21] <Meltgar> Music's Patience is gone Kappa
[5:00:24] <%cubbywolf> aim high dude
[5:00:27] <Johannen> But at least Woolie is going his own way
[5:00:29] <+Cuon_Alpinus> jump and aim bro
[5:00:30] <moonmintparadise> no you need to time it
[5:00:30] <@Solidus_113> you're not jumping after the wall run
[5:00:32] <+trackles_64> only wools can find these bugs
[5:00:33] <crimsonsaens> It doesn't look like Woolie is wall jumping
[5:00:36] <Johannen> Woolie is true Sigma Gamer
[5:00:37] <$eco419> Aim up
[5:00:44] <%cubbywolf> maybe not that high
[5:00:53] <dds333a> Uhh, that works

[5:01:01] <+Cuon_Alpinus> You could have also just dashed up onto the center pipe going through the entire area
[5:01:04] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Kappa
[5:01:05] <Meltgar> It works! FBCatch
[5:01:06] <BlackermanZX> are you jumping while wall running
[5:01:15] <%cubbywolf> learning momentum in fps isnt intuitive but once yoi get it you get it
[5:01:16] <MyNameIsRasus> do you need to aim that fast? it seems like you could hold for a bit to get slowmo time
[5:01:20] <Space_Pagan> no music in this segment, i checked other walkthroughs
[5:01:38] <%cubbywolf> are you jumping off the wall?
[5:01:53] <%cubbywolf> slash run
[5:01:54] <$eco419> Oh no there is suppose to be ambiance sounds is totally bug
[5:01:54] <dds333a> Woolie is playing better when he's just going it on reaction, kinda
[5:02:21] <Lancaster_H> LUL
[5:02:27] <%cubbywolf> woolie has fgc reactions but hes learning a new controller every game LUL
[5:02:30] <+OblivionSword1> all right let's go back

[5:02:36] <+OblivionSword1> Bit's over

[5:02:40] <Johannen> Its called GhostRunner...not GhostSlasher)
[5:02:50] <%jonblnt> IS IT READY ON STEAM?
[5:02:50] <BlackermanZX> science went too far
[5:02:51] <T_Sasquatch> r.i.p
[5:02:57] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:02:57] <dds333a> The funniest part is that there is much more slashy after this segment
[5:02:59] <Lancaster_H> CLEAN
[5:03:00] <crimsonsaens> He actually jumped this time
[5:03:01] <%ChoculaUltra> he's getting it
[5:03:03] <%cubbywolf> he did it atmleast
[5:03:04] <T_Sasquatch> Abomination defeated
[5:03:04] <%ChoculaUltra> maybe LUL
[5:03:16] <$eco419> C  L E A N
[5:03:17] <T_Sasquatch> bruhhh
[5:03:20] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Already better LUL
[5:03:22] <Asuterisuku> The "Abomination" would work better on PC.
[5:03:24] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:03:27] <T_Sasquatch> i can hear the fail compilation
[5:03:34] <FalseKingAki> why is stick sensitivity so high
[5:03:38] <Asuterisuku> Where the mouse is being read raw and not mapped to a control stick.
[5:03:47] <T_Sasquatch> sensitivitythen bruh
[5:03:50] <snackcanary> yeah that's what got me too
[5:03:57] <+TensecondTarvis> oof

[5:04:17] <%Irridium> LUL
[5:04:17] <Asuterisuku> Woolie vs. Controllers
[5:04:18] <Idon__> I thought Woolie liked Titanfall NotLikeThis
[5:04:20] <crimsonsaens> Woolie vs controller
[5:04:23] <%cubbywolf> woolie vs gamers
[5:04:35] <$eco419> Woolie vs platforming
[5:04:37] <dds333a> lul
[5:04:48] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:04:48] <Johannen> Titanfall has STRONK auto aim and help with gamepad
[5:04:57] <Lancaster_H> it all comes tumbling down
[5:04:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000
[5:05:03] <T_Sasquatch> i dont think its ever been this bad

[5:05:21] <%cubbywolf> do it use the keyboard
[5:05:24] <+OblivionSword1> How's the steam download ?
[5:05:26] <metrying> this game on mkb is heaven
[5:05:27] <%barbatolover> nice controller right?
[5:05:28] <+TensecondTarvis> isnt this the game where you are supposed to never stop moving
[5:05:31] <BlackermanZX> gotta switch to steam
[5:05:33] <T_Sasquatch> lower your sens ,its really not that bad
[5:05:42] <haitakaa> let reggie try
[5:05:52] <justcallmebobplease> Give Reggie the controller!
[5:05:54] <dds333a> yeah
[5:05:58] <$eco419> Yeah let Reggie try Kappa
[5:06:06] <%Jiggisnipe> and you did it
[5:06:12] <Johannen> Yay..Reggie
[5:06:14] <%ChoculaUltra> release the Reggie cut
[5:06:18] <@Menitta> huh
[5:06:19] <penitentpendant> Throwin' Reggie under the bus
[5:06:20] <+OblivionSword1> cause why not
[5:06:21] <MyNameIsRasus> THE REGGIE CUT
[5:06:21] <%barbatolover> WOH!
[5:06:22] <BlackermanZX> try the hybrid doodWat
[5:06:23] <Asuterisuku> Reggie talkin' shit, let's see him do it.
[5:06:23] <+OhioNitsud> Reggie gonna kill it
[5:06:23] <%TheBensonator_> LETS GET IT REGGIE
[5:06:25] <Space_Pagan> let him suffer
[5:06:28] <%jonblnt> try it try it
[5:06:29] <masterfire23> both controls
[5:06:30] <theanora1> Suffer for the internet Reggie
[5:06:31] <justcallmebobplease> YES
[5:06:31] <%ezgoldar> woolieYE
[5:06:33] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[5:06:34] <justcallmebobplease> DO IT
[5:06:35] <CureMode_> hell ya
[5:06:36] <$eco419> LUL
[5:06:42] <dds333a> I'm all for it, but I was actually referring to UK
[5:06:42] <%Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:06:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Swap control schemes, yo
[5:06:47] <T_Sasquatch> INB4 FIRST TRY
[5:06:53] <%ChoculaUltra> ReggieVersus
[5:06:55] <Johannen> Sensativity is too high?
[5:06:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> That sensitivity looks crazy
[5:07:03] <dds333a> Alrighty HERE WE GO
[5:07:05] <BlackermanZX> sensitivity may be too high
[5:07:09] <+TensecondTarvis> yeah maybe dial the sens down a bit
[5:07:10] <@Menitta> the other control schemes have button jumping
[5:07:15] <@Solidus_113> mirror's edge does it, that's all that matters
[5:07:15] <amonimis> kinda seems like sensitivity and/or control scheme needs to be adjusted
[5:07:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @WoolieVersus you can change from bumper jumper
[5:07:21] <Asuterisuku> It's literally just about keeping your fingers on the sticks.
[5:07:22] <$eco419> Oh this is what I was waiting for
[5:07:27] <@Menitta> I beat it with the Vanguard setting
[5:07:32] <haitakaa> see it's not just woolie
[5:07:32] <%ChoculaUltra> bumper jumper is just fun to say
[5:07:37] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus reset sensitivty
[5:07:44] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Bumper Jumper is a superior control scheme for movement shooters in general with jump cause it lets you keep both sticks in control
[5:07:48] <jorniev> man im exited for all that katana zero content
[5:07:59] <pmda2126> what is reggie stumbled into another route
[5:08:08] <pmda2126> if*
[5:08:15] <$eco419> L1
[5:08:18] <+MisleadingEchoes> @jorniev what katana zero content?
[5:08:20] <%ezgoldar> reggie just finds an access elevator somewhere
[5:08:20] <%jonblnt> ok Reggie
[5:08:21] <amonimis> tbh not a fan of wall running not being automatic
[5:08:32] <+Cuon_Alpinus> it is automatic
[5:08:36] <+Cuon_Alpinus> they're just crazy
[5:08:40] <%Irridium> it... should be automatic?
[5:08:42] <haitakaa> yeah the sensitivity seems weird
[5:08:44] <%cubbywolf> the ultimate enemy
[5:08:44] <crimsonsaens> I thought it was automatic too
[5:08:45] <BlackermanZX> do you still have like 75 sensitivty
[5:08:53] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Cuon_Alpinus it's really iffy tho, it's better on Mirrors Edge
[5:09:01] <amonimis> @Cuon_Alpinus wait then what're they saying about r1 lol
[5:09:05] <+Cuon_Alpinus> oh yeah for sure this game is maximum eurojank
[5:09:07] <+MisleadingEchoes> It's only automatic when you dash
[5:09:10] <%ChoculaUltra> it reminds me of titanfall 2 more than anything tbh
[5:09:11] <%nicversus> are we going back to pad?
[5:09:12] <amonimis> o
[5:09:13] <T_Sasquatch> reduce your sensitivity you increased it when you were using the abomination
[5:09:16] <%cubbywolf> dont let the game win
[5:09:18] <%RyTYoung> Controller support ain't great
[5:09:22] <$eco419> Cool
[5:09:23] <Darren716> its not a bug
[5:09:24] <@Menitta> Apparently its not a bug but idk
[5:09:25] <Lancaster_H> its almost as if its made for mkb
[5:09:36] <penitentpendant> An attempt was made!
[5:09:39] <+cubbywolf> every woolie vs fps gets wierd
[5:09:53] <%Irridium> fun fact this game is out on switch fuckin' rip to switch owners
[5:09:54] <dustworthmain> QA Stand at it again?
[5:09:57] <snackcanary> Yeppp. The controls hit me like that too...
[5:09:57] <%nicversus> Woolie turned a simple action platformer into Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy
[5:10:02] <$eco419> Thank you Reggie :) now Woolie feels better about his performance
[5:10:11] <dds333a> In terms of setup, at least, Infinite Warfare went off without a hitch
[5:10:20] <@Menitta> Shame. I hope its a hump you can get past. It's got a lot of really cool shit going on
[5:10:26] <Lancaster_H> steam saw the gameplay and noped the fuck out
[5:10:28] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:10:30] <BlackermanZX> WHAT plan
[5:10:32] <townzzzzz> tech stream
[5:10:35] <Tracazoid> Steam: "I'm not sure I want in on this shit."
[5:10:37] <huskarl_zap> CRAZZZZZZZZZZZZY ON YOU
[5:10:38] <T_Sasquatch> masaka
[5:10:38] <EternalJedi> time to switch limesYay
[5:10:40] <DatAsuna> play classical gas
[5:10:44] <martinhadameme> leave the performance issues in the bedroom! 🤣
[5:10:48] <$eco419> Woolie Defeated
[5:10:50] <KaiserMario> Damn.. Woolie's sweating...
[5:10:51] <haitakaa> yeah the sensitivity was way too high guys
[5:10:53] <%ezgoldar> oh well
[5:10:54] <moonmintparadise> the game is not going to be easier from here
[5:11:01] <Darren716> Try other control schemes?
[5:11:03] <KaiserMario> Woolie's glistening right now!
[5:11:10] <Nightwingie> FeelsBadMan
[5:11:23] <+MisleadingEchoes> The game kinda makes you brute force some shit tho
[5:11:27] <$eco419> @kaisermario the heater in their room is making things hotter on their end
[5:11:33] <Lancaster_H> GAMERCUBE
[5:11:42] <KaiserMario> Oh I thought it was the effort LUL
[5:11:45] <Asuterisuku> I have the same problem.
[5:11:47] <%ChoculaUltra> warmth stream
[5:11:48] <martinhadameme> just get shirtless already
[5:11:54] <FrostedZaibatsu> No windows?
[5:12:02] <@Solidus_113> using the stream footage is going to be real ugly. Twitch crushed the bitrate to be almost completely unwatchable for that digital section
[5:12:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:12:03] <martinhadameme> if you aren't streaming in a diaper, are you even actually streaming?
[5:12:06] <%Zeif00> Y'all do lookin a little shiny
[5:12:09] <%Irridium> rip off that shirt like a yakoozie boss
[5:12:15] <$eco419> Sweaty Dudes on stream
[5:12:27] <+paladinstarbuster> een pat dropped it
[5:12:31] <%Skullgod> COWARD
[5:12:32] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus I suggest trying out some of the other control schemes. I found the default really uncomfortable.
[5:12:32] <%cubbywolf> use a k and mouse
[5:12:32] <Lancaster_H> if you dont release this on YT youre a COWARD
[5:12:34] <%ChoculaUltra> hyperbolic time chamber off-panel training arc
[5:12:35] <T_Sasquatch> BACK TO IT TAKES TWOOOO
[5:12:36] <+paladinstarbuster> Is it?
[5:12:43] <%cubbywolf> RELEASE THIS TO THE ANIME
[5:12:46] <@Menitta> I used Vanguard which was the closest to Titanfall parkour
[5:12:46] <+TheotherKristian> Is woolie bad?
[5:12:47] <dds333a> Play em out
[5:12:48] <haitakaa> I think it'd be easier with lower sensitivity
[5:12:58] <$eco419> Yes Woolie not good :(
[5:13:00] <Asuterisuku> Don't play this game on controller.
[5:13:03] <%cubbywolf> if heard that about this game
[5:13:05] <DatAsuna> That's where bumper jumper is your friend
[5:13:06] <T_Sasquatch> @TheotherKristian yes ! its rough but its doable
[5:13:14] <derap41> This is called a Twitch Shooter for a reason
[5:13:17] <martinhadameme> this game also it's course real early
[5:13:29] <DatAsuna> super hot gives you ample time yeah
[5:13:31] <T_Sasquatch> we are joking on woolie but its absolutely rough
[5:13:41] <radar410> You can totally play this on controller, just needs good hand-eye coordination
[5:13:59] <%gatorafan> Week of THE TROUBLES
[5:14:04] <$eco419> It was a nice try maybe next time woolz
[5:14:09] <%Skullgod> Streamer lost FeelsBadMan
[5:14:09] <martinhadameme> disco elysium is gonna be a 4 month lp
[5:14:15] <@Menitta> I couldve sworn there was music in this part.
[5:14:20] <@Menitta> I was woolieONEGUY

[5:14:43] <%nicversus> It was fun while it lasted!
[5:14:47] <fritz_dacat> looks like your the real ghostrunner
[5:15:01] <$eco419> You tried TwitchSings
[5:15:08] <@Menitta> if Ghostrunner was given mainstream attention, it would be the exact same conversation surrounding Sekiro
[5:15:14] <%nicversus> the tasty, tasty sausage

[5:18:47] <Siconia> Never be game over
[5:18:47] <Lancaster_H> did it?
[5:18:50] <Asuterisuku> It would work better on PC.
[5:18:52] <%cubbywolf> it didnt work at all
[5:18:52] <dds333a> Every game in the Persona series has gotten an updated rerelease
[5:18:55] <%barbatolover> umbasa
[5:19:04] <pmda2126> probably a bad game to try it
[5:19:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:19:06] <diegobandzz> Games been rigged from the start
[5:19:12] <%cubbywolf> better but still garbage
[5:19:15] <Asuterisuku> The problem is how the PS4 maps the mouse to the stick.
[5:19:17] <+paladinstarbuster> The jump in that game is ass
[5:19:24] <+kullumanati> Kill it dead Reggie
[5:19:26] <DatAsuna> Yeah it's easier, but part of it's also just gitting gud
[5:19:38] <DatAsuna> That said new setups are best tested with familiar games not new ones lol
[5:19:48] <diegobandzz> No but git gud tho
[5:19:57] <%cubbywolf> get a desk or something
[5:19:58] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpFeelsBeardMan
[5:20:01] <Lancaster_H> oh no not shift
[5:20:05] <masterfire23> just get a moni keypad for that
[5:20:07] <+MisleadingEchoes> For me the wallrun only worked if I dashed, using keyboard and mouse. Other than that you need to press jump twice.
[5:20:08] <masterfire23> mini
[5:20:09] <+kullumanati> The true demon souls for Reggie
[5:20:09] <radar410> Spacebar elaKek
[5:20:10] <%cubbywolf> you def need shift wasd and space
[5:20:12] <@Solidus_113> MMO mouse can cover everything
[5:20:13] <%Jiggisnipe> no desk only C U B E
[5:20:14] <%Skullgod> in order to get better, you have to get worse :)

[5:21:01] <+OblivionSword1> Woolie you might want to practice WASD with a simpler game
[5:21:01] <Lancaster_H> good job you labbed for a single day woolie
[5:21:04] <%Skullgod> @WoolieVersus maybe someone can use WASDA while you just aim with a mouse :)
[5:21:06] <Klefth> WASD is the absolute worst
[5:21:10] <+kullumanati> We need the podcast controlled by the abomination
[5:21:20] <%cubbywolf> LUL well you cant just jump in to hard shit as a beginer at anything
[5:21:25] <radar410> I don't think anyone's ever learned a new controller in a couple minutes tho LUL
[5:21:26] <%nicversus> Scott the WASD
[5:21:29] <%RyTYoung> It's WORSE than Mario 3D world on the WII U
[5:21:30] <+Catpurnicus> Woolie, M+K isn't for you, you don't have to explain it
[5:21:36] <+trackles_64> I dontget what's confusing about WASD
[5:21:40] <%ezgoldar> oh God get that stick away from me
[5:21:46] <Johannen> WASD on its own never works, you have to implement the mouse into your movement
[5:21:49] <%cubbywolf> you totally arr doing it though
[5:21:51] <+MisleadingEchoes> You mean like with everything? Drawing, coding, anything? The natural learning process?
[5:21:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> You just gotta montage it, already got the music going lol
[5:22:01] <%cubbywolf> and you are getting interested in fps
[5:22:04] <Lancaster_H> see you had Overwatch for that
[5:22:12] <+Catpurnicus> yeah everyone who uses M+K customizes the keyboard keys to fit their setup better
[5:22:16] <+MisleadingEchoes> Overwatch works super well with controller.
[5:22:18] <+Catpurnicus> I use the right side of the keyboard instead
[5:22:22] <dds333a> at the  very least
[5:22:27] <Nightwingie> I'd say if you want to keep playing this game, just take some time to practice the movement off-stream fareehaHeart There's definitely a learning curve
[5:22:29] <NotHereToStream> takes time to adapt, got to keep at it if you got the time
[5:22:33] <DatAsuna> woolie has a doctor's note
[5:22:44] <%Tuna_Can_0> yea I've trained my pinky to use ctrl and shift with WASD for the past 15 years
[5:22:45] <+trackles_64> Play Call of Duty and WASD will be ingrained into your mind.
[5:22:51] <masterfire23> get a 1 handed keyboard that might be more comfortable with getting used to it
[5:22:52] <%Skullgod> I did what now
[5:23:09] <%cubbywolf> you need to improve your keyboard hand
[5:23:11] <%Seancicle> contexte manquant
[5:23:12] <Lancaster_H> aimlab?
[5:23:14] <DatAsuna> aim trainers
[5:23:15] <townzzzzz> playing stalker is the way to go
[5:23:21] <%cubbywolf> flash games
[5:23:24] <+Catpurnicus> what I did is rest my hand on the keyboard and find a spot where I didn't get carpal tunnel
[5:23:26] <masterfire23> aimlab everyday is a routine for me
[5:23:30] <NotHereToStream> didn't like a huge streamer use osu as their training tool
[5:23:37] <DatAsuna> I don't think aim is as much his issue as wasd though
[5:23:46] <%cubbywolf> sounds lkke your a sniper
[5:23:47] <%Skullgod> alot of huge streamers use osu
[5:23:54] <+Catpurnicus> if the only time you use a mouse is on the hardest twitch shooter, then its not going to go well
[5:23:56] <EternalJedi> I played too much Elite Beat Agents to play OSU on anything but a touchscreen
[5:24:07] <+Catpurnicus> its like only using a stick when you play marvel
[5:24:07] <%Tuna_Can_0> I never use those, I feel my aim gets worse. I just play the game
[5:24:08] <@Menitta> Osu is fucking insane
[5:24:15] <+Catpurnicus> and you play marvel once every 2 years
[5:24:17] <%cubbywolf> i sometimes pub stomp in fps games and i never practice out of the game
[5:24:18] <%Skullgod> i just play OSU with friends casually
[5:24:20] <Lancaster_H> yeah i used to play osu in between cs matches shits hard
[5:24:28] <@Menitta> Its arthritis in an exe
[5:24:29] <%Skullgod> jamming with the boys
[5:24:31] <+RyanTheRecluse> to be honest I'd say maybe play titanfall 2 campaign or multiplayer on mouse and keyboard since you enjoy that game. If you can get movement in that you'd be fine for most fps's
[5:24:36] <Johannen> Its all an aquired skill with time
[5:24:44] <+paladinstarbuster> has woolie played friday night funkin
[5:24:51] <%Seancicle> act like you got some sense 🤟🏻🤘🏻
[5:24:57] <%Skullgod> top osu players use like drawing pads not mouse
[5:24:59] <EternalJedi> rooVV Elite Beat Agents
[5:25:02] <Asuterisuku> Many Osu! players use an artist's tablet for that purpose.
[5:25:05] <@Solidus_113> Real pros play Osu with drawing pads, yeah
[5:25:07] <$eco419> Boooo
[5:25:10] <%ezgoldar> how bout bop it
[5:25:11] <DatAsuna> I remember jubeat
[5:25:15] <@Menitta> Drawing pads are great for osu

[5:25:48] <EternalJedi> and EBA was all great covers
[5:25:51] <glass_marcus> The DS Zelda games killed my dsi
[5:26:24] <Darkdrill> the ds was so great
[5:26:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:26:25] <@Menitta> idk how people did that
[5:26:29] <Siconia> my sister lost her stylus so she used a hair pin, safe to say her touchscreen was like sandpaper
[5:26:35] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Shoutout to poor liam
[5:26:36] <NotHereToStream> wrist destroyed
[5:26:36] <@Menitta> I played so much Pokemon Ranger and it was fine
[5:26:38] <%RyTYoung> That was the WORST
[5:26:39] <dds333a> pretty much
[5:26:46] <Darkdrill> i still feel the pain of kid icarus and it was GREAT i want more
[5:26:53] <%cubbywolf> kid iccarus gave people carple tunnel for life
[5:26:56] <%Skullgod> who would permanetly damage their hands with a game, not me :)
[5:26:58] <dds333a> just playing it
[5:27:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> needs a freaking stand to not ruin your wrist
[5:27:06] <%Jiggisnipe> Sakurai enjoys inflicting pain
[5:27:10] <%cubbywolf> every single gamer ever
[5:27:10] <Prevot> playing Kid Icarus Uprising is not worth the risk, just watch a LP instead
[5:27:11] <Asuterisuku> Metroid Prime: Hunters had a similar control scheme, but the DS was lighter than  the 3DS.
[5:27:19] <dds333a> joking, but intensive gameplay could fuck you up
[5:27:22] <Astrophizz> that's a terrible design
[5:27:23] <snackcanary> banana stand required
[5:27:27] <%cubbywolf> kid iccarus is actually risky
[5:27:30] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Gameboy SP only gave you numb pinkies
[5:27:33] <Darkdrill> that game was AMAZING the pain gave you passion
[5:27:37] <%Seancicle> deuxsement
[5:27:40] <haitakaa> didn't that happen to Liam
[5:27:42] <DatAsuna> great game, bad controls

[5:27:59] <EternalJedi> yeah, agreed
[5:27:59] <%Skullgod> he's not wrong
[5:27:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> 100%. Great game that i don't want to play
[5:28:00] <bonebagMEL> that's not unpopular
[5:28:01] <dds333a> uh oh

[5:28:27] <+vnzuelandude> I got by ignoring one screen

[5:28:53] <Saltmeisterr> 10 hours i hear?
[5:28:54] <dds333a> joking, but the game absolutely takes getting used to
[5:28:54] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You're like 1/3 through, roughly
[5:28:56] <@Menitta> damn, rip their marriage
[5:28:59] <%gatorafan> That game is about marriage?
[5:29:00] <+FuqBoiSlim> @rjay80 I only played shadows of almia. which was apparently way easier than the first one
[5:29:01] <Darkdrill> :O woolly and reggy it takes 2  marry
[5:29:07] <%cubbywolf> nah woolie also has minh and V
