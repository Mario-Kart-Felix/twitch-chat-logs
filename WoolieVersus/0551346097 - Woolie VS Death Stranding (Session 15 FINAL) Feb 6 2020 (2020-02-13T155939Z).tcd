[0:02:40] <Mothman742> imagine not being able to sleep in 2020 Kappa
[0:02:41] <Ahk_90> You just need a good dumb argument with a friend about dumb things and that will wake you up real good
[0:02:43] <%Irridium> sometimes you shut your eyes, open them, and five hours have past but you don't actually felt like you slept at all
[0:02:50] <+drfaustisdead> HellBlade is very good.
[0:02:54] <%xpakeo> woolie is gonna be dead by the end of the stream

[0:04:58] <%SomersaultJustice> someone activated woolie, and he became kim jong il

[0:05:49] <blaggablag> You're basically living in a constant state of trying not to be in North Korea
[0:05:55] <%Prevot> it's not nice if you're born there
[0:05:56] <am_omega> Its nice, when you blow Kim.

[0:11:16] <%DensityD> DO IT LIVE
[0:11:23] <alrobot2014> ew pinkies for control
[0:11:27] <AceOne5> Hi Woolz and Reggie
[0:11:33] <blaggablag> Now I want to see Woolie try a fighting game with a steering wheel and a paddel shifter
[0:11:34] <+Javaa01> You must learn self control
[0:11:42] <%The_Timo> Lol playing like a psycho lol
[0:11:44] <%gatorafan> uh oh, BIG
[0:11:49] <%DensityD> remember when woolie would squeeze the dark souls controller so hard it would creak and almost break?
[0:11:58] <Djinnazz> It's not hand size, i think you might be holding it too hard.
[0:12:14] <Mothman742> i member
[0:12:53] <+ianabstract> The steam controller has back paddles, but only two
[0:12:53] <%jepupu> For Honor is literally the only game where those extra buttons have been useful for me
[0:13:00] <+NocturnePsycho> Shit am I late or on time
[0:13:07] <%DensityD> you are mostly on time
[0:13:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> on time
[0:13:15] <+NocturnePsycho> Nice
[0:13:18] <%Reverend_Roscoe> !uptime
[0:13:20] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 31 minutes and 23 seconds
[0:13:24] <Fdrank> hold it with your mind
[0:13:27] <+Taglog7> Grasp it firmly in your hand
[0:13:30] <Djinnazz> let it rest on your fingers
[0:13:35] <%DensityD> awww, baby woolie with his 1st controller
[0:13:36] <+BionoidLCR> GRASP IT FIRMLY
[0:13:37] <%DensityD> where's the art
[0:13:38] <%SomersaultJustice> use your truth to hold it
[0:13:43] <+Taglog7> LUL LUL LUL
[0:13:58] <%Ecchigun> yup
[0:14:01] <peachy996> Amputate your hands and get better robot prosthetics
[0:14:07] <+HollowMan190> fimly grasp it bunbeeOk
[0:14:13] <%SomersaultJustice> I agree, bring back foot pedals
[0:14:16] <Fdrank> hold it with your dreads
[0:14:17] <%Ecchigun> just loose up the grip
[0:14:25] <%DensityD> an extra button would be nice, Woolie but remember these controllers have to be for everyone and people have different hand sizes
[0:14:28] <%Solidnick18> i grip it to hard sometimes
[0:14:37] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:14:39] <%Atomik456> oh yeah those things are useless
[0:14:40] <%DensityD> widespread ergonomic design is tricky sometimes
[0:14:42] <+HollowMan190> wut is that
[0:14:44] <%Atomik456> for me anyway
[0:14:46] <Djinnazz> Looser
[0:14:47] <+Taglog7> I see cheeto dust
[0:14:48] <a_mad_dragon> toulouse
[0:14:50] <%Atomik456> i get you woolie
[0:14:50] <trueherobappo> whoa
[0:14:52] <Setaro> yeh you got big hands
[0:14:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 How's it going Woolz? My friend did a database oopsie on a utility, so I'm doing a rush fix while he's away on lunch. You got any stories from your QA days of someone doing a code oopsie?
[0:14:54] <+linSP> i want a controller with all buttons replaced with squishy triggers
[0:14:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[0:14:55] <+Javaa01> The thing with the Elite is that you don't need to firmly grip it if you hold your pointer and middle fingers on the bumpers and triggers at the same time, your ring and pinky hold it naturally
[0:14:58] <trueherobappo> those are some meaty fingas
[0:14:59] <%The_Timo> Lol Fucking informercial demonstrations
[0:15:01] <Shishi1205> Gracias por el LuvBrownL, @generalscpatton.
[0:15:04] <%DensityD> all these fingers, put a ring on it
[0:15:05] <Mothman742> just get smaller hands 4Head
[0:15:08] <trueherobappo> Is that a new camera?
[0:15:11] <alrobot2014> i have baby hands and would have to do the reach around to hit those
[0:15:11] <+Bonkasaurusrex> Yeah I dont like the paddles
[0:15:12] <+ComradePenguin> I think the steam controller did paddles better. There's plenty of controller to grip and not accidentally hit the paddle doing it
[0:15:16] <%ozzrabbit> ok, I've never seen the Pro controller paddles. those are in some weird positions
[0:15:16] <am_omega> Ah Controller problems. Going from The Duke to like a Dualshock feels like I am just crushing the Dualshock.
[0:15:18] <%jiggy_snipe> paddles seem dumb
[0:15:21] <+Javaa01> But I will say, the Elite paddle buttons are VERY sensitive
[0:15:22] <+SirGO0SE> hot
[0:15:23] <%DensityD> can we rent hands from @AngriestPat ?
[0:15:28] <%Irridium> just play with tekken fingers bro 4Head
[0:15:32] <+SirGO0SE> exactly
[0:15:35] <Fdrank> get a harness to suspend the controller
[0:15:35] <+Proxzo> @Javaa01 you don't have to but that's just how he has held them for 20 years
[0:15:37] <+McSoliace> i thought you could take those off?
[0:15:38] <+call_me_comic> FLASH THE SIX
[0:15:41] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Haha Pat is a tiny hand bitch.
[0:15:45] <Cubblesv2> "Three fingers max" - Reggie, 2020
[0:15:50] <blaggablag> Yeah you'd think they'd set them up in a way you could click em with your ring figer in a more deliberate way
[0:15:57] <%gatorafan> @densityd who is this angriest Pat person you speak of? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:16:01] <+Proxzo> it's not worth it to retrain your muscles just so you can use muscles
[0:16:07] <+Proxzo> paddles
[0:16:10] <%DensityD> apatWink
[0:16:42] <peachy996> I play Tekken in the heretical way

[0:16:55] <+Proxzo> Woolie have surgery on your thumbs so you can use paddles on your elite controller
[0:16:57] <peachy996> On a Pad with button binding for the shoulder buttons
[0:17:08] <+drfaustisdead> Woolie has finally awakened.
[0:17:22] <am_omega> Hey at least you don't have fucked up hands from playing 200 hours in MH Freedom Unite.
[0:17:22] <%gatorafan> just get better hands lmao 4Head
[0:17:23] <peachy996> Heretical to some but Yoshimitsu is more fun to play
[0:17:27] <trueherobappo> psaBig
[0:18:23] <VidulaSaix> Horizon was a pretty dope game

[0:19:12] <trueherobappo> I'm trying to beat Falllout 4 before I lose interest in it again.
[0:19:19] <pirateofpie> I'd have to start over
[0:19:28] <am_omega> Yeah a year break in any JRPG is a death sentence. That is why I get a sticky note to refresh myself.
[0:19:30] <+Ancopro> cause you dont want it to end doodSad
[0:19:31] <trueherobappo> I've never beaten it too so it makes this adventure even better

[0:38:00] <ZComiX> Has he done the chiral artist break up quest?
[0:38:00] <@Solidus_113> That's an online order you took a long time ago
[0:38:08] <lewdiversal> ^
[0:38:14] <%Irridium> what he said
[0:38:17] <samuraijakanddaxter> ancient order
[0:38:17] <TheSphereHunter> read the chat
[0:38:23] <@Solidus_113> Check your orders list to remove
[0:38:24] <+linSP> should make some gold weapons btw
[0:38:26] <%mrhandsss> he's had that order for weeks
[0:38:33] <%gatorafan> never read the chat Kappa
[0:38:43] <%Irridium> yeah you should make, like, a bunch of Higgs' weapons
[0:38:45] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Chat doesn’t read chat.
[0:38:55] <VidulaSaix> Yeah craft Higgs weapons
[0:38:56] <lewdiversal> atpHarada
[0:38:58] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus
[0:39:02] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolie just created another ghost
[0:39:03] <%Solidnick18> it be like that
[0:39:15] <samuraijakanddaxter> like when he killed the elder
[0:39:15] <ElenaManetta> I can't believe friend requests don't stop even when the Earth is fucked
[0:39:19] <%Solidnick18> we got a game to finish
[0:39:22] <ZComiX> So no to the artist?
[0:39:23] <+huuwahh> Nah you have to accept order requests manually. It doesn't just appear in your order list
[0:39:30] <samuraijakanddaxter> king tut
[0:39:33] <peachy996> In thr truck, out the truck, in the truck
[0:39:34] <+johnny_gogo> Bring GUN
[0:39:39] <%Exiliator> Will Sam save us? Will he DELIVER us from evil?
[0:39:43] <@Solidus_113> Higgs Jourrnals 5 to 9 can be found southwest of the Junk Dealer, in the ruined city with a bunch BTs
[0:39:47] <%mrhandsss> make some of those new guns
[0:39:58] <+Javaa01> Replace your rifle with the new custom guns you got
[0:39:58] <red_blaster> Make the Custom Higgs guns
[0:40:04] <%Irridium> you reeeeeally should make a few of higgs' assault rifles and shotguns
[0:40:09] <red_blaster> The Custom Higgs guns can hurt BTs
[0:40:28] <samuraijakanddaxter> non lethal higgs rifle
[0:40:32] <%Irridium> recycle your stuff and load up
[0:40:36] <%Exiliator> Fresh! woolieGASM 👌
[0:40:44] <%The_Timo> No Higgs guns are way better
[0:40:56] <+linSP> ultima weapons
[0:41:01] <samuraijakanddaxter> non lethal higgs rifle uses crystals
[0:41:08] <+RadDude6969> I only used hematic grenades on BTs the whole game
[0:41:09] <VidulaSaix> All lethal weapons can hurt BTs
[0:41:12] <@Solidus_113> The Higgs guns have a specific new power
[0:41:14] <VidulaSaix> Just switch to Hematic
[0:41:15] <+linSP> no use for crystals at this point tho
[0:41:21] <VidulaSaix> And yeah they're special
[0:41:22] <+linSP> besides as ammo
[0:41:37] <%Solidnick18> oh shit
[0:41:37] <Graxe_> Chiral ammo
[0:41:45] <+Proxzo> Chiral Guns
[0:41:55] <VidulaSaix> Normal weapons are 100% obsolete when you have Higgs weapons tbh
[0:41:58] <samuraijakanddaxter> its like a 6 in one really
[0:41:59] <peachy996> It's the M4 Custom from MGs4
[0:42:05] <jorniev> GUNS
[0:42:19] <blaggablag> Chiral ordnance is a pretty neat final stage improvement
[0:42:21] <%Irridium> blood grenade cloud + chiral rounds = fucking SREDDING bt's
[0:42:28] <+linSP> yeah you dont really have to worry about killing humans at this point
[0:42:47] <VidulaSaix> ENDLESS BLUD
[0:43:15] <VidulaSaix> Quad
[0:43:19] <Overloard> blood rocket PogChamp
[0:43:19] <+Ancopro> quad
[0:43:22] <samuraijakanddaxter> i rocked the oxygen mask non stop since i first got it, i dno how it drains woolie's battery so much
[0:43:44] <%Irridium> shotgun is great too
[0:43:44] <Tucker0603> MULTI
[0:43:58] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Blood shotgun is insanely op
[0:44:28] <+ianabstract> I think the battery drain was from the gear combo
[0:44:42] <%mrhandsss> there will be a perfect opportunity to fix that later
[0:44:42] <ValentineWolf7> Amazon Delivery Man getting ready for war.
[0:44:45] <%Solidnick18> all set
[0:44:52] <samuraijakanddaxter> do armour plates drain battery? because i never wore those
[0:44:55] <+Javaa01> Yeah the Higgs Shotgun hits like a truck against BTs

[1:03:50] <%jiggy_snipe> that's why Spec Ops was different
[1:03:51] <+Mkingston> If Metal Gear was done in the Decima engine
[1:03:52] <%mrhandsss> black ops 1 is still honestly the best cod imo

[1:08:26] <DonatelloJose> here comes them fellows
[1:08:28] <+linSP> ito read lovecraft right
[1:08:29] <%jinking79> NoHomo
[1:08:32] <jorniev> ME AND THE BOYS
[1:08:34] <Fdrank> light yagami did nothing wrong
[1:08:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Madds is coming for his BB, and no one will stop him
[1:08:37] <scoopyoopydoo> does it turn into metal gear now?
[1:08:39] <%Solidnick18> time to fight
[1:08:44] <mujahideenfruityrebels> The boys showing up for Mario Party.
[1:08:45] <%mrhandsss> i love how mads smoking wasnt even in the script, he just kept showing up smoking and koji thought it was badass so he added it into the game
[1:08:47] <katocrimson> If Kojima really makes a movie it'll be cool be the story will make no sense
[1:08:57] <VidulaSaix> Higgs guns are broken as hell
[1:08:59] <%Solidnick18> that's awesome
[1:09:01] <VidulaSaix> Big worth payoff
[1:09:06] <scoopyoopydoo> kojima obsessed with cigarettes like an edgy highschooler
[1:09:07] <worldbrand> there are a lot of ito's works that i don't really like but i cannot deny the man has breadth and skill, he's not successful in the genre for no reason
[1:09:08] <%Solidnick18> it looks like piss
[1:09:09] <Doomstar16> He just wants his bb back.
[1:09:22] <+Mkingston> Kojima's movies would be awful.
[1:09:22] <%mrhandsss> they broken cause they burn through chiral crystals FAST
[1:09:29] <lewdiversal> @scoopyoopydoo cause despite being unhealthy it simply looks cool in media atpSmoke
[1:09:37] <JDebss> maybe shoot back
[1:09:37] <%Solidnick18> oh god
[1:09:38] <%The_Timo> Just focus Mads
[1:09:39] <+luftraumm1> game's a bit low on volume
[1:09:40] <peachy996> Decent cover? It's Nam
[1:09:40] <samuraijakanddaxter> GET TO THE CHOPPA!!
[1:09:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> it's the same guy LUL
[1:09:42] <%Swedish_Expert> i think anime is what kojima could be good at
[1:09:43] <+Taglog7> i want my bb back bb back bb back
[1:09:44] <VidulaSaix> Volume's fine
[1:09:46] <%mrhandsss> if u didnt have a mountain of gear on, you could be hiding in the grass
[1:09:47] <scoopyoopydoo> @Javthusiast it also feels good in your lungs
[1:09:52] <@Solidus_113> your fat stack of packages is ruining you
[1:09:56] <+Mkingston> eat a bug
[1:09:58] <dadeaner> didn't go with the stealth option? im surprised
[1:10:01] <derap41> @katocrimson He'd need a director like dan aykroyd had that can take all that creative craziness and turn it into something understandable
[1:10:04] <Shishi1205> eat cryptos
[1:10:10] <VidulaSaix> Mads is lighting that ass up
[1:10:10] <Doomstar16> Ooo. He's dead.
[1:10:12] <lewdiversal> @scoopyoopydoo dont know about that tried it and it was disgusting Kappa
[1:10:12] <+JacknZack27> Eat
[1:10:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> cryto

[1:10:42] <scoopyoopydoo> @Javthusiast yeah you have to try it like 5 times before you like it
[1:10:48] <scoopyoopydoo> so basically not worth
[1:10:54] <scoopyoopydoo> smoke weed kids
[1:10:55] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus normally you can hide in the tall grass, you however are a moving skyscraper
[1:10:59] <lewdiversal> @scoopyoopydoo guess you are right, same happened to me with beer
[1:11:12] <scoopyoopydoo> exactly like beer
[1:11:12] <rumblarrock> was cliffs sequence inspired by that dragon force song?
[1:11:21] <%The_Timo> I did this entire section with Multi rockets and grenade launcher lol
[1:11:30] <%Solidnick18> he went that way
[1:11:35] <lewdiversal> through the chiralium and flames Kappa
[1:11:41] <derap41> Shits on fire yo
[1:11:43] <Shishi1205> ditch packages to camouflage
[1:11:44] <+Mkingston> dat stack tho

[1:11:49] <VidulaSaix> Fat stacks
[1:12:02] <worldbrand> i was quite undergeared and had to rely on the lv2 rifles lying around

[1:12:08] <@Solidus_113> use those rockets
[1:12:32] <VidulaSaix> LUL

[1:14:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 So, Cliff isn't "Man literally too angry to die". He's "Man literally angry enough to seize command of War-Hell". What a cool dude.
[1:14:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat!

[1:44:26] <tiaramaki> Didn't they say Sam's adopted???
[1:44:27] <RunningNGunning> Sam is Adopted
[1:44:27] <+charp35> you know you saw diehardman at the beginning of the game and he is clearly black
[1:44:27] <%The_Timo> yeah it's mentioned that he's adopted
[1:44:27] <samuraijakanddaxter> might have had him before she was 20
[1:44:27] <+Caped_Eggy> They all know sam is adopted
[1:44:28] <derap41> No one thought to ask where the presidents kids came from
[1:44:29] <Shishi1205> We know this from the beggining

[1:44:33] <%Exiliator> Kreygasm
[1:44:34] <+DesertPenguin> Wait, Sam's white?
[1:44:34] <+CapraCreep> Sams adopted

[1:44:36] <+Ancopro> yea there was a file already im pretty sure
[1:44:36] <alrobot2014> didn't we already know sam was adopted from the start?
[1:44:37] <Mothman742> @peachy996 ah so shes the worst characters of eva combined Kappa
[1:44:39] <%mrhandsss> pretty sure they said near the beginning of the game sam was adopted

[1:44:47] <+sirisvirus> he's adopted
[1:44:50] <samuraijakanddaxter> fuckin chat lmaoooo
[1:44:51] <+D00msDayDan> @woolieversus sam’s adopted
[1:44:51] <Shishi1205> Game says he is adopted
[1:44:55] <shaggycactus> from the start i assumed he was adopted
[1:44:56] <Shishi1205> pretty early on
[1:44:59] <+eanscrale> Didn't they mention him being adopted?
[1:45:00] <VidulaSaix> Game has said he was adopted tons before now
[1:45:01] <%LordSDB> I think the beginning actually does bring it up
[1:45:02] <Nomad94> @peachy996 It's not a spoiler, the game's mentioned it before
[1:45:03] <FutaSnek> SHES BLONDE HES BRUNETTE
[1:45:04] <+linSP> he was adopted
[1:45:05] <FutaSnek> EZ
[1:45:05] <%jiggy_snipe> Adoption still exists so it's fine
[1:45:06] <worldbrand> there's an email or a log or something
[1:45:07] <powerprotoman> woolies brain no work
[1:45:08] <+Damie904> They say early on Sam's adopted
[1:45:09] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yeah Reggie remembers it right
[1:45:09] <arsonistdaria> The said multiple times he's adopted
[1:45:10] <trueherobappo> Tes
[1:45:11] <samuraijakanddaxter> did the game mention it?
[1:45:12] <%ECRead> the game at the start says adopted
[1:45:12] <trueherobappo> Yes
[1:45:12] <derap41> They can fuck that all that matters
[1:45:14] <+JacknZack27> They said he was adopted before
[1:45:14] <trueherobappo> There ws.
[1:45:15] <mujahideenfruityrebels> It explains he was adopted early on, no one is spoiling.
[1:45:16] <+Caped_Eggy> This was way earlier in the game If I remember correctly
[1:45:17] <kennyfz> Plot twist, Sam is one of the dead children from Les Enfant Terrible
[1:45:18] <VidulaSaix> Game mentioned it a lot at the start
[1:45:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the game mentioned it its not a spoiler
[1:45:20] <+Ancopro> isnt that why sam has like a billion last names
[1:45:21] <$MateoPeso> My mom is blonde and I have brown hair lmao c'mon peeps
[1:45:22] <Nomad94> It's way early, yes
[1:45:22] <VidulaSaix> But it was a long time ago to be fair
[1:45:25] <+drfaustisdead> yeah they're pretty explicit that he's adopted.
[1:45:27] <vincerocmm> damn no water orang piss
[1:45:28] <peachy996> It's been too long to remember that point
[1:45:28] <%Irridium> look all that matters is they're not related by blood so they're good to go
[1:45:29] <$afronooch> its super early on
[1:45:35] <peachy996> months have passed
[1:45:42] <%mrhandsss> never once got bloody piss grenades
[1:45:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> it was nearly 2 hours gametime
[1:45:48] <+sirisvirus> it does say he's adopted you probably forgot it
[1:45:51] <gamewarden92> @Irridium Priorities
[1:45:54] <%LordSDB> Woolie chat is trust-able enough to not spoil something like this
[1:45:56] <%mrhandsss> only knew it was a thing because i saw a video with it after i beat the game
[1:46:02] <samuraijakanddaxter> i cant remember them saying he was adopted earlier
[1:46:03] <+drfaustisdead> looks like the ghost internet is fucked.

[2:35:04] <samuraijakanddaxter> pat's said before he should get a bigger tv
[2:35:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> This man rejects the concept of vison. This false prophet rejects the Universal Truth for the solipsistic dream he sees in his mind.

[3:19:31] <+Proxzo> Woolie realized it was the garrote command for the strand
[3:19:34] <lewdiversal> I shot Kappa
[3:19:34] <lyzejag> Norman Keedus
[3:19:36] <peachy996> You bumbled your way to victory ove Pat "3 Times we're dead" Boivin
[3:19:39] <MayorRev> BibleThump
[3:19:39] <+Mkingston> Pat said Woolie would hate this game and be shit at it. Woolie proving him wrong.
[3:19:40] <+luftraumm1> woolie emotionally more developed than pat confirmed
[3:19:40] <AceOne5> I shot too
[3:19:41] <vVAstrAVv> i wish he even could reggie
[3:19:41] <Baziiiinga> I think the red dress symbolizes that same has yet to pop ze cherry. Or maybe it means he has? The only subtext not explained. Cause shes black in this scene. It must be popped right?
[3:19:42] <%Solidnick18> i shot her
[3:19:44] <+Caped_Eggy> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli But it start with you aiming at her tho, you would shoot at least once
[3:19:46] <%DensityD> apatBig Feels
[3:19:49] <kennyfz> Saaam baaaby, he'll make your dreams come true
[3:19:49] <+sirisvirus> pat couldn't figure it out

[3:19:52] <derap41> Also what the fuck is going oin
[3:19:54] <+voodoolawyer> I bet he wanted to kill her but tried to do it with his hands instead
[3:19:54] <mujahideenfruityrebels> 99% of players domed her.
[3:20:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> Talk no jutsu is too strong
[3:20:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Caped_Eggy I shot at her 6 times, it doesnt affect her, then by process of elimination the only way is going to her.
[3:20:09] <+Jaysky> Choke her out
[3:20:12] <+Freelance7> I shot her, ran out of bullets, then ran up and hugged her.
[3:20:13] <+drfaustisdead> I am not a line. I am a single point.
[3:20:16] <ALTRNico> now suplex her
[3:20:17] <%jiggy_snipe> woolie figured it out Kappa
[3:20:17] <+DesertPenguin> REACH OUT AND TOUCH FAITH
[3:20:18] <blaggablag> He wanted to Shinji chokehold her
[3:20:20] <Tuna_Can_0> where's the strangle prompt?

[3:20:38] <archaicbro> @mujahideenfruityrebels IDK like Kojima is extremely anti-war, so hugging her seemed like the right choice
[3:20:38] <%DensityD> STRAND
[3:20:38] <karl_rex> STRANDS

[3:20:50] <Reizie_Etherealm> IZUNA DROP
[3:20:52] <+Mendin> Amelie did say "Pull the rope or cut the noose", and a gun is just a stick, not a rope

[3:21:21] <dukenux> The gun is the key to all of this.
[3:21:23] <Shishi1205> its the blood from the bullets
[3:21:24] <Zayasu> nice shot
[3:21:25] <+Caped_Eggy> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli The point is how did woolie not shoot her even nce
[3:21:27] <Baziiiinga> Bring this into the pokemon world and show the swords and shields whos boss sam. Deliver it to the pocketo monsta.
[3:21:30] <vVAstrAVv> i hate how dooms is just her shared dreams to sam leaking out but HES only lvl 2 lpl

[3:22:27] <KaitlynnHere> It’s like spirited away!
[3:22:28] <laguerrilha> Princess Beach BibleThump
[3:22:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> She just wanted to stop being alone

[3:22:42] <+NotHereToStream> the thing is...shes abit evil tho
[3:22:42] <jorniev> this actress is good
[3:22:48] <VidulaSaix> Her motivation is horrible but yes, for someone forced to spend eternity alone it makes sense
[3:22:53] <+voodoolawyer> ah, it is
[3:22:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Imagine being the end of the world incarnate but you have to wait a million years to do your part.
[3:22:54] <Ragnaroked_> "No one would blame me if I ended existence"

[3:23:23] <%DensityD> Guys, I miss Dinosaurs
[3:23:25] <Baziiiinga> To be fair, end all existence = No one can be mad at you for ending existence.
[3:23:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Keep evolving through SPIRAL ENERGY
[3:23:26] <%jiggy_snipe> a flower grows from concrete Kappa
[3:23:26] <%DensityD> mammals suck
[3:23:27] <kulmoth> how do you evolve from being completely anti-matter bombeb though?
[3:23:29] <worldbrand> [kojipro metaphor]
[3:23:33] <%valriot> She evil by consequence, not by nature. You have to shoot the gun, do you do it now or in 8 years time
[3:23:33] <%Prevot> now its time for HOMO SUPERIOR
[3:23:35] <red_blaster> Kojima says Extintion = Good
[3:23:35] <+freeizone> [komm susser tod]
[3:23:35] <VidulaSaix> The things that survive do
[3:23:35] <CirclesForever> i thought the extinction is when you put out a fire durrrrr
[3:23:37] <+drfaustisdead> No matter what she did this was going to happen, it's legit fate, and it actually sucks for her because she's sapient.
[3:23:38] <+Mendin> @MayorRev I came back from space, and I SAW THE EARTH ABLAZE
[3:23:39] <Shishi1205> remeber the game awards and the performance?
[3:23:39] <+Javaa01> @MayorRev The world's just blowing up a bit don't worry about it
[3:23:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I mean the end of existence was gonna happen anyway, is her reasoning
[3:23:42] <lyzejag> This is very MGS 2 Snake speech like

[3:23:59] <AceOne5> she gets to act here
[3:24:00] <derap41> @Swish20XX marrying gameplay and story is the peak of games as media death stranding isn't great at doing it outside of thematic elements

[3:27:50] <MayorRev> ohhh fuck i think i know whats
[3:27:50] <samuraijakanddaxter> the team said he could be stuck forever

[3:28:18] <Nomad94> here's that exposition she promised earlier
[3:28:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yeah Amelie being an EE is just living a hellish existence
[3:28:27] <%mrhandsss> dooms
[3:28:28] <+linSP> sams body and soul is on his beach
[3:28:32] <VidulaSaix> Yeah this is the exposition before it faded to black

[3:28:34] <samuraijakanddaxter> sam is stranded on the beach forever game over
[3:28:34] <+linSP> hes trapped
[3:28:37] <Baziiiinga> I still have no idea what DOOMS is and what the heck "I have the extinction factor" means and that's at the begining of the game.
[3:28:39] <%jiggy_snipe> that's gotta suck
[3:28:42] <GarbageNirvana> @91darby You can always catch up on the vod
[3:28:44] <peachy996> But did she become an EE or was she born an EE
[3:28:47] <+Mkingston> In my restless dreams. I wait for you. In Silent Hill.
[3:28:54] <derap41> @na
[3:28:56] <Shishi1205> born?
[3:28:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @peachy996 born, she was the EE for this generation
[3:28:59] <+drfaustisdead> there's no difference between being alive or dead, if you're all alone.
[3:29:06] <iseath> Man, that's... fucked up

[3:33:27] <+DesertPenguin> What's an example of a triple entendre
[3:33:27] <+Mkingston> because English isn't his first language.

[3:33:51] <VidulaSaix> All will be answered
[3:33:53] <peachy996> I do like the seperate twist though that's a pretty cool twist
[3:33:53] <+tearfuldevil> deaths tranding is a cool game with a dumb story with very little redeeming qualities
[3:33:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HOT COLDMAN get it coz COLD WAR!?
[3:33:56] <am_omega> @derap41 Because she was chosen
[3:33:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> Kojima is the first person who could crack the Da Vinchi code

[3:34:12] <vVAstrAVv> she actually had no soul lol
[3:34:13] <dukenux> WOO LIE, oh my god, it's been in front of our eyes for all these years
[3:34:13] <katocrimson> WOO LIE PA TRICK
[3:34:14] <$MateoPeso> The actual end is pretty god imo
[3:34:15] <@Solidus_113> he's also large
[3:34:19] <VidulaSaix> One has very different experiences than the other
[3:34:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> VAMP is a Vamp because hes a Vampi-----GAY
[3:34:21] <+drfaustisdead> man people really hate when other people try to be clever.

[3:34:28] <lewdiversal> Pantrick woo lie NotLikethis
[3:34:29] <+Javaa01> Fatman really is a Thicc Boi
[3:34:35] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @katocrimson OOOOH PogChamp

[3:34:45] <MayorRev> bruh you got teleported
[3:34:46] <+Mendin> the mother, the son, and the holy ghost(sister)
[3:34:49] <Nomad94> Some people get off on telling other people they're not smart.
[3:34:49] <ALTRNico> yes
[3:34:50] <@Solidus_113> yep
[3:34:50] <alrobot2014> wasn't that ritsuko?
[3:34:51] <+drfaustisdead> beginning even.
[3:34:52] <+Mkingston> keep calling out
[3:34:52] <+tearfuldevil> @Nomad94 sure, you keep telling yourself that
[3:34:57] <mirtosss> I wonder what the Konami version of this would have been.
[3:35:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is Haruhis Endless Eight
[3:35:07] <%jiggy_snipe> infinite beach
[3:35:08] <Nomad94> @tearknack Hey, you just threw bullshit out here, then so can I.
[3:35:09] <+NotHereToStream> pachinko stranding
[3:35:10] <+NocturnePsycho> Youre mixing asuka and ritsuko's mothers

[3:35:21] <samuraijakanddaxter> not atsukas mum
[3:35:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> @koalabeige Deliver the lever AND PULL IT!
[3:35:26] <%Exiliator> We truly are a walking simulator now
[3:35:27] <am_omega> Please spare me
[3:35:29] <AceOne5> I find it interesting that the more you donate or recycle materials the more you see President Strand's portrait more often and you can kind of figure it out, but if you are only using materials for yourself you almost never see it outside the early cutscenes
[3:35:30] <%fingalights> Absolute Truth
[3:35:33] <+Ryu_R> I'm still reeling from a woo thats a lie
[3:35:35] <Explodincatz> here we go
[3:35:39] <derap41> Don't you love if when the game has to keep explaining what it was about even after its "finished"
[3:35:41] <+drfaustisdead> Absolute Truth
[3:35:43] <+linSP> ok kojoomer
[3:35:45] <jorniev> OH GOD ITS THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH
[3:35:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @acedeone wfym?
[3:35:46] <%ECRead> oh lord
[3:35:48] <chronoxgp> He's just like "please make it stop! end it now!"
[3:35:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> *wdym
[3:35:49] <Ragnaroked_> Its the Mirror Woolie talked about on the podcast
[3:35:50] <+freeizone> super internet
[3:35:52] <+agumon9000> THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH
[3:35:58] <%jiggy_snipe> the beach is the Universal Truth
[3:35:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> She's the founder of the house of universal trurth
[3:36:00] <Baziiiinga> @KoalaBeige Shoot waves of BTs, if you die you get a "Would you like some help?" and you are taken to a microtransaction store with 5 x rocket launchers for only $10
[3:36:00] <+Mendin> Woolie's Cult is on the Chiral Network
[3:36:01] <lyzejag> TRUTH ?
[3:36:01] <jorniev> FATHER MAXWELL
[3:36:05] <ZComiX> How many more loops do we have?
[3:36:06] <%DensityD> 2 more hours
[3:36:06] <Pappajimbo> woopsadoodle
[3:36:11] <dukenux> So Sam's purgatory is to listen to exposition for seemingly eternity?
[3:36:12] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @BallerSwagBro9k
[3:36:15] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Amelie. Woolie. Amoolie.
[3:36:16] <mirtosss> @Baziiiinga sounds about right lamo
[3:36:18] <+linSP> apatWhat LuvUok
[3:36:20] <FutaSnek> So did Trump get voidouted LUL
[3:36:24] <VidulaSaix> Yes
[3:36:26] <@Solidus_113> This is like the elevator/Shinji grabbing Kaoru scenes. Completely empty, but conveys a strong image
[3:36:27] <+Mendin> Welcome to sunny Costa del Akashic Record
[3:36:27] <FutaSnek> Ayyy
[3:36:28] <Shishi1205> he did
[3:36:29] <dukenux> WHOA
[3:36:34] <dukenux> he dissapeared
[3:36:34] <Nomad94> @FutaSnek He canonically died in a voidout in Manhattan
[3:36:37] <Tuna_Can_0> WubTF what is what?
[3:36:38] <derap41> Oxygen
[3:36:39] <%DensityD> Did Britain get voidouted from Brexit?
[3:36:40] <chronoxgp> @Baziiiinga don't joke, that happend to me in the last boss of DMCV
[3:36:45] <derap41> litterally fucking pxygen
[3:36:46] <ZComiX> Trumps an EE
[3:36:47] <+linSP> trump was offhandedly mentioned in the elders emails
[3:36:53] <%Irridium> but then why did she make it go faster
[3:36:59] <mirtosss> @chronoxgp git gud
[3:37:13] <+Maldoree> dammit i missed it
[3:37:15] <Riorii> have people never played a kojima game before? lore exposition like this is at the end happened in like every metal gear
[3:37:17] <Darkmega97> Not the Ha!
[3:37:20] <derap41> To much oxygen in the atmosphere caused massive feedbacks loops that killed 90% of all life and it did it twice
[3:37:27] <+Ancopro> and you did!
[3:37:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:37:30] <Sartastic> what a CREEP
[3:37:33] <+Mendin> Yeah but Konami at least put the pretense of editorial oversight on Kojima
[3:37:35] <Dingo_Eejit> Heat ThekeyMan
[3:37:36] <+freeizone> 5G will be a mistake
[3:37:43] <+Mendin> This is Raw Unadulterated Kojima Plot Zone
[3:37:48] <Lionkevinson> 母ですか
[3:37:48] <vincerocmm> you didnt yee before you haaed
[3:37:50] <jorniev> traiLER
[3:37:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Mendin idk this just seems as long as most Metal Gear infodumps
[3:37:54] <Nomad94> @Mendin And that's not a bad thing
[3:37:54] <@Solidus_113> Galaxy brain
[3:37:54] <reonome> ah fuck I missed the first part
[3:37:56] <chronoxgp> my cat got bored and walked out
[3:37:59] <gunsrlove> Kojima Shower Thoughts
[3:38:00] <samuelfisk> “Asked”
[3:38:05] <chancho4tierra> OPTIC FIBER IS A MISTAKE
[3:38:08] <+Mendin> REALITY WAS A MISTAKE - Hodeo Kojimus
[3:38:12] <%jiggy_snipe> DUALITY
[3:38:13] <Laecerelius> CHAOOOS!!
[3:38:21] <KasiCrafter> Now this is just jibberish.
[3:38:24] <+Caped_Eggy> Well this something particle physicists like talk about
[3:38:25] <Riorii> mgs climax pauses for 20 minute long codex calls LUL
[3:38:27] <+Ryu_R> this game was a real learning experience though, kojima needs someone to wrangle him
[3:38:29] <+freeizone> Gods want Order
[3:38:29] <jorniev> THIS IS AWESOME
[3:38:30] <dukenux> It alllllll returns to nothiiiiiiiiiiiiing
[3:38:32] <+Mendin> It all... returns... to nothing? It all comes... tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down?
[3:38:33] <Sedrelic> so why are we here in limbo you bitch
[3:38:37] <mirtosss> I get that Kojima always does this. But you got 100 hours of game to explain your plot. Why rush it all at the end?
[3:38:37] <%jiggy_snipe> so Earth = Universe?
[3:38:40] <Darkmega97> That's the story of the second impact
[3:38:42] <peachy996> So even Amelie didn't know despite being an EE
[3:38:44] <Baziiiinga> I played MGS 4 as my first metal gear as a little baby 12-13 year old. my MGS love came from a bleed effect from the super best friends hyping it up, though I never played 1, 2, 3
[3:38:49] <+Razputin217> NANOMACHINES, SON
[3:38:50] <gunsrlove> ...bruh....wut
[3:38:54] <OldManDeckardCain> ys8 did this so much better LUL
[3:38:55] <VidulaSaix> And this is when she went a little nuts with all that information
[3:38:55] <+freeizone> row row
[3:38:56] <derap41> Because of quantum fluctuations at the begin of the universe during the rapid expansion literally differences in quantum tunneling meant matter won out over anti matter
[3:38:56] <cahv123> She's making a lot of assumptions here.
[3:39:05] <powerprotoman> this game is jsut woolies cult of unviersal truth
[3:39:07] <%Irridium> it's not that it's a plot dumb that's the problem it's that everything she's saying is goddamn nonsense LUL
[3:39:08] <+NotHereToStream> basically adapt scrub 4Head
[3:39:09] <Vikken141> ah, the part Pat disagrees with
[3:39:09] <peachy996> Imagine being the catalyst to destruction and you don't even know the answers
[3:39:12] <worldbrand> do you get it? it's about konami and kojima productions
[3:39:14] <Pappajimbo> wipe out 90% of all life for more time on the clock
[3:39:15] <@Solidus_113> spiral energy
[3:39:16] <+linSP> she wanted to blow up the whole planet tho
[3:39:17] <chronoxgp> mgs 1,2 and 3 are the best ones
[3:39:21] <laguerrilha> And this concludes my TED Talk
[3:39:21] <lyzejag> Uh
[3:39:24] <gunsrlove> Kojumbo Energy
[3:39:25] <%fingalights> Amalia did nothing wrong
[3:39:27] <jorniev> this is like a book
[3:39:29] <+freeizone> pat the lazy bum who wants free food woolie hunted LUL
[3:39:29] <+tearfuldevil> that is a bunch of meaningless gibberish
[3:39:29] <dukenux> Isn't that just the Reaper logic?
[3:39:29] <%Prevot> we gurren lagann now?
[3:39:37] <jorniev> GURREN LAGAN
[3:39:42] <Ragnaroked_> Go even further beyond
[3:39:42] <VidulaSaix> Yep exactly
[3:39:43] <gunsrlove> `Woolie, no
[3:39:44] <Darkmega97> Fuck you universe! You're not my real dad!
[3:39:44] <Nomad94> @tearknack Oh, just go away already.
[3:39:48] <%jiggy_snipe> sure
[3:39:48] <+Mendin> And hence why Bridget struggled
[3:39:48] <gunsrlove> Dont think about it
[3:39:49] <+tearfuldevil> no u
[3:39:51] <+NotHereToStream> nah, backing down is the correct solution
[3:39:52] <gunsrlove> No thinking about it
[3:39:55] <Tuna_Can_0> After humans the cats will rise up
[3:39:55] <derap41> Most evolution occur at extinction events so in a way she's right
[3:39:57] <peachy996> @dukenux nah Reaper logic is dumber
[3:39:57] <GodKingReiss> Glad Woolie is having a better time understanding this than Pat did
[3:39:58] <samuelfisk> The warm blooded shrews were superior to the dinosaurs.
[3:39:58] <redrins> the LAST stranding, what else would there be
[3:40:01] <%jillpilled> Strugglers are cooler anyway
[3:40:01] <gunsrlove> Just let Kojumbo dump his exposition thoughts
[3:40:02] <+NotHereToStream> no, always BACKDOWN
[3:40:03] <Nomad94> I'm a Lee
[3:40:04] <+heyitsdenzel_> but i like giving up
[3:40:04] <gunsrlove> and let it end
[3:40:04] <peachy996> Like waaaay dumber
[3:40:07] <Dingo_Eejit> @KasiCrafter @ correctioin, Kojumbberish. Kojumbborish Allsorts
[3:40:07] <%Exiliator> woolieYE
[3:40:08] <Baziiiinga> AME LIE - AME CHEAT - AME STEAL
[3:40:10] <+Mendin> Bridget struggled against the dying, yes. Amelie... has other thoughts
[3:40:11] <alrobot2014> @dukenux reaper logic was that organics will just make more reaper like ai to kill themselves, so they'd just kill them before they get that far
[3:40:14] <+Taglog7> sounds like outer world preacher talk
[3:40:15] <pirateofpie> I like Woolie's take on it. ...I can't wait for the argument on the podcast
[3:40:15] <%Firgof> Kojima figured out the meaning of life. The meaning of life is to Never Be Game Over.
[3:40:15] <jimmytwofeet> but what about all the bridge babies and stillmothers
[3:40:16] <+heyitsdenzel_> never backdown 2. the backdown
[3:40:17] <VidulaSaix> I love the people in chat that still dont get it
[3:40:18] <laguerrilha> A meteor can take it easy
[3:40:25] <+Caped_Eggy> How is pat better than a dinosaur?
[3:40:26] <derap41> Makes people angry
[3:40:27] <+tearfuldevil> what if gurren laggan had less substance
[3:40:28] <+Mendin> We're not done yet Jimmy,
[3:40:28] <FutaSnek> See he gets it
[3:40:28] <+VGKamikaze> So basically... we ALWAYS want that runback.
[3:40:29] <+agumon9000> LUL
[3:40:32] <Riorii> like pat LUL
[3:40:32] <chronoxgp> that infuriates me to no end
[3:40:32] <+Ryu_R> THOSE people didn't make it this far
[3:40:33] <$MateoPeso> People take it too seriously
[3:40:33] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus This is the stuff that Pat thinks is the absolute worst thing ever. He didn't understand it at all
[3:40:33] <BallerSwagBro9k> @heyitsdenzel_ LUL
[3:40:36] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus do not go quietly into the night, but RAGE! RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT!!!

[3:41:02] <%jillpilled> GOD DAMN IT
[3:41:04] <+Taglog7> You should play pathologic next Kappa
[3:41:05] <VidulaSaix> I loved this part
[3:41:05] <%The_Timo> Is the exposition or the mediocre writing? lol
[3:41:05] <worldbrand> i dont mind, like, the sequence, i just mind what's actually being said
[3:41:07] <punishedlasagna> Some ppl never watched an anime before lol
[3:41:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> DELIVERY FUCKING CONFlRMED
[3:41:10] <$MateoPeso> Art is divisive
[3:41:13] <gunsrlove> @VidulaSaix I guess big brain geniuses understood this instead of seeing it for the big cringefest of exposition dumps
[3:41:14] <+eanscrale> Yeah I'm good
[3:41:14] <mirtosss> I get the "play with what a videogame is". But I think Nier:Automata did it way better
[3:41:16] <laguerrilha> I hate the messy writing. games can have messages and story, but it can be good or bad
[3:41:17] <%Firgof> I liked it because it wasn't fun, really. It felt fun to be literally put in Sam's shoes.
[3:41:17] <derap41> Pat really hated this
[3:41:19] <@Solidus_113> BABY
[3:41:21] <peachy996> HERE WE GO
[3:41:22] <KasiCrafter> Is it for ANYBODY?
[3:41:22] <+tearfuldevil> its got very little in common with me1 or me2, and being compared with me3 isn't a good thing
[3:41:22] <ALTRNico> blap blap
[3:41:23] <Sartastic> DUH
[3:41:23] <mujahideenfruityrebels> I had a frown on my face
[3:41:26] <Dingo_Eejit> A blue man, in a blue world...
[3:41:28] <+Caped_Eggy> @redrins You are telling me, that pat is better than a dinosaur? LUL
[3:41:30] <Tuna_Can_0> @KoalaBeige hard agree
[3:41:35] <chronoxgp> if you get bored just look at the 4k rocks
[3:41:39] <Darkmega97> He's babyyyy
[3:41:41] <Baziiiinga> I think Kojima actually wanted you to wait 1 month in real life time to unlock the ending. 1 month = 1 year game time.
[3:41:42] <%fingalights> I'm fine with the exposition, just not what it's saying
[3:41:43] <+Ryu_R> baby not okay BibleThump
[3:41:46] <$afronooch> I still think this is weakest part. It skyrockets back up tho
[3:41:46] <derap41> I hated this because it was ungodly pretensions and felt undeserved
[3:41:47] <katocrimson> can u zoom in here?
[3:41:47] <VidulaSaix> BabyRage

[3:49:33] <+Caped_Eggy> @redrins man, jurassic park really messed you up
[3:49:34] <+heyitsdenzel_> dab on the rocks
[3:49:34] <+Mkingston> Naruto run across the beach
[3:49:34] <+voodoolawyer> She's super right this whole time too
[3:49:35] <+NotHereToStream> you can't blame her, but she did some awful shit with the bb tech
[3:49:35] <VidulaSaix> Ludvig didnt make this song LUL
[3:49:35] <Darkmega97> grab the strands
[3:49:38] <lyzejag> LOW ROAR IS FIRE
[3:49:39] <kennyfz> Take a piss
[3:49:42] <Baziiiinga> The EE mimics what you think the EE is. Sam sees her as Amelie. The dinosaurs saw the EE as a dinosaur and chilled for a while.
[3:49:42] <blaggablag> Look at that moss textutre tho
[3:49:43] <jorniev> NO THIS IS LOW ROAR
[3:49:43] <Riorii> this isnt ludvig LUL

[3:49:47] <peachy996> Low Roar, Silent Poets and Ludvig all came together for a great soundtrack
[3:49:47] <+voodoolawyer> Like Humanity in OUR TIMELINE has less than 1000 years at this pace
[3:49:48] <iamnotaparrot> so she's just ryoji from P3?
[3:49:49] <%The_Timo> Nope lol
[3:49:49] <laguerrilha> All Low Roar songs are great
[3:49:51] <+Freelance7> @NotHereToStream Oh she's definitely a horrible person
[3:49:54] <redrins> @Caped_Eggy only watched the first one, dino books messed me up
[3:49:55] <+Proxzo> She messed up by trying to do it sooner.
[3:49:56] <derap41> Amelie didn't have any agency about what she did/was
[3:49:57] <$MateoPeso> The CHVRCHES song is great
[3:49:59] <Baziiiinga> The problem is when the dinosaur got to the EE it saw it was covered in feathers and killed itself.
[3:50:02] <+freeizone> you can't stop nature
[3:50:03] <Camail> she was trying to fight it
[3:50:03] <kennyfz> Pee on the ocean

[3:50:20] <+Caped_Eggy> @redrins Well I hope you get better man
[3:50:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> What was Pat's take on the EE again?
[3:50:23] <+voodoolawyer> I gotta blast. I am so excited to see how the boys react to this bullshit
[3:50:23] <%Irridium> it's one thing if you can't help it but she intentionally sped it along
[3:50:31] <MayorRev> Special Thanks: YOU
[3:50:37] <%Irridium> and then was like "but no tho"
[3:50:39] <+drfaustisdead> I am not a line, I am a single point.
[3:50:39] <MayorRev> Thanks For Playing!
[3:50:39] <peachy996> @Reizie_Etherealm NO THIS IS STUPID basically
[3:50:43] <+Mendin> The first EE with full sapience and emotions was torn between prolonging for the sake of living despite duffering, and burning out fast with dignity
[3:50:46] <%jiggy_snipe> Pat didn't understand this but Paige did

[4:12:03] <archaicbro> Honestly, truly wondering if Kojima Productions will ever attempt to create a cinematic cut of their movies. It's as much of a challenge to certain award-giving bodies as Netflix-only movies haha.

[5:05:50] <Fkain23> theres a stiger
[5:05:51] <chronoxgp> i got the chvrches song on the way there I thought
[5:05:51] <%Irridium> @DonatelloJose voidouts happen when a BT eats a live person so in that situation it's fine
[5:05:51] <duskrush> Death Stranding is the world's most profound dead baby joke
[5:05:52] <StarlitStunner> strip7 strip7 strip7 strip7 strip7
[5:05:52] <VidulaSaix> There is a small post credits scene @WoolieVersus
[5:05:53] <jimmytwofeet> it means Amelie was a Nazi scientist
[5:05:54] <JaseAdrift> YOU PROVED YOUR SMATER THAN PAT
[5:05:55] <%DensityD> I didn't like them
[5:05:55] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @DonatelloJose Void out is BT touching living thing, you turn into a BT after a bit of time so the BT that woulda been made out of him was not there yet
[5:05:56] <serpenttucker> @DonatelloJose Voidouts are triggered by BT's, not by just death
[5:05:56] <peachy996> Goddamnit Kojima you still got it
[5:05:57] <%jiggy_snipe> a baby with a bullet hole in it
[5:05:57] <samuraijakanddaxter> BRAVISSIMO
[5:06:00] <gunsrlove> The end scenes were amazing, but otherwise Kojumbo can fuck off

[5:06:20] <+Mendin> Do you remember that when Amelie pulled the gun, she said "I know better than anyone that shooting you wont help"
[5:06:21] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> The real treasure was the fetus we were all along
[5:06:21] <+sirisvirus> there is a short after credits

[5:06:27] <jorniev> I LOVE YOU CRAZY MADMAN
[5:06:27] <+drfaustisdead> Only Kojima could make a game with a baby with a bullet hole and it not being exploitative.
[5:06:28] <godila2> @Tucker0603 just random BB
[5:06:29] <derap41> Why did Sam never think that the stomach cross would have anything to di with his stomach cross?
[5:06:31] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> B

[5:06:44] <nothuzad> Cliff was super wrong by almost killing his own kid so his rightous "aner" would ahve robbed him of his kid once more V:
[5:06:45] <duskrush> Forgive me Lisa, THERE'S A MONSTER INSIDE OF ME
[5:06:47] <blaggablag> Deadman confirms it very early on. He says there's no way Unger is the father because he's at least 30 years too late.

[5:10:37] <+Mendin> Using a pillow and blanket wrapping as an ersatz silencer is A Thing in movies, yes.
[5:10:40] <%mrhandsss> here's something else to consider. yes the 5 figures could've been the 5 EEs. it also could've been sam's 5 friends who were searching for him. that's another theory
[5:10:42] <ireliaismaiwaifu> kojima clearly didn't care for realism at the whole ending sequence
[5:10:44] <+razielhex> @Nomad94 Hahaha awesome. We were fuckin' yellin' at Pat for what seemed like 15 minutes because he kept shooting mommy and then letting her go to kill the whole world.
[5:10:45] <Tuna_Can_0> @razielhex I like to think Pat wanted to shoot her and reloaded 7 times until he wanted to move on

[5:11:10] <GodKingReiss> You can TAKE MY HEEAAART
[5:11:16] <peachy996> Lou was a random BB Sam bonded with

[5:11:19] <lyzejag> This song <3 <3 <3
[5:11:19] <samuraijakanddaxter> lou was just another bb they were using
[5:11:20] <+ConLin_Arts_> Lou is the biggest red herring
[5:11:20] <Tucker0603> Lou was just Igor's BB
[5:11:21] <Nomad94> @ireliaismaiwaifu So you DON'T have anything of value to say. Also, that's a slur, you moron. Blocked.
[5:11:24] <Hammatime8> Oh hey CHVRCHES
[5:11:25] <%Irridium> I think they just replaced you with a random BB and just hid all the evidence
[5:11:25] <VidulaSaix> Just to be clear to those in chat who don't seem to understand, Lou is NOT Sam. Lou is a random BB. When plugging into BB, Sam was seeing his own memories.
[5:11:26] <%Grahfvitnir> Lou's just a regular BB
[5:11:27] <+Maldoree> Read EMAILS
[5:11:27] <ireliaismaiwaifu> what a bitch
[5:11:29] <clonexsniper> well Lou is number 28
[5:11:30] <+Ancopro> Lou is bb28
[5:11:30] <duskrush> Basically. The BB experiments continued and Bridges was using them and so were the terrorists since they were in Amelie's employ as well. Igor gives you the BB and you're meant to think that the memories that you're seeing are Lou's but they're actually yours
[5:11:30] <TheIndigoLlama> @mrhandsss that's the case in the ending Pat got IIRC
[5:11:33] <+NotHereToStream> the memories are yours, you connecting to bb triggers that because sam use to be a BB
[5:11:33] <Pappajimbo> bbs and dooms usally dont mix. so when sam connected he feedbacked his own memories
[5:11:35] <+freeizone> Prototype EVA

[5:12:20] <Shishi1205> BB's memories were actually your OWN
[5:12:20] <duskrush> DOOMs is just a condition that gives you death visions and superpowers
[5:12:22] <arkv01> DOOMS is just xmen
[5:12:22] <$laphyrion> @ireliaismaiwaifu Calm down, kid.
[5:12:23] <Blackjackal95> Where did Extinction Entities come from?
[5:12:23] <+linSP> post game emails
[5:12:23] <peachy996> Was Kojima right to leave MGS behind?
[5:12:24] <worldbrand> they never even tell you what DOOMS stands for
[5:12:26] <+NotHereToStream> works*
[5:12:27] <+drfaustisdead> Visions of tDooms-Day and powers
[5:12:31] <%mrhandsss> there are SOME "loose ends" like Heartman's family. they get answered in emails/interviews you can unlock postgame.
[5:12:31] <+Mendin> @jiggy_snipe DOOMs is a connection to the beaches and Amelie and thus a feedback of nightmares/visions and potentially additional beach/bt stuff
[5:12:33] <Nomad94> @worldbrand Or MULEs
[5:12:34] <%fingalights> eh, i guess. close enough
[5:12:34] <samuraijakanddaxter> or did he?
[5:12:36] <+PleasantLeech> honestly it has a better story than phantom pain
[5:12:36] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> DOOMs is just when Amelie gives you powers and it comes with visions from her
[5:12:36] <gunsrlove> Dooms is just how the story can progress
[5:12:36] <+LandOfTheWay> DOOMS is basically just a weaker offshoot of being an extinction entity
[5:12:38] <Tuna_Can_0> SourPls SourPls SourPls

[5:13:13] <kennyfz> Dominion Over Our Mortalities?
[5:13:14] <+Mendin> Yeah the final Episode 0.5 needs to be after some postgame farming to unlock them
[5:13:14] <Mopopolis> This was the 6th EE
[5:13:16] <derap41> That or something else
[5:13:16] <ireliaismaiwaifu> nice ad hominem
[5:13:17] <Doomstar16> VoteYea PJSugar
[5:13:18] <worldbrand> But why were they there in the intro with Fragile in the cave?
[5:13:20] <am_omega> Wait why is he a bitch?
[5:13:28] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus I'm almost certain the 5 figures are the previous EE's because you see them at the very beginning in the cave before Sam makes any of these connections
[5:13:28] <Nomad94> @samuraijakanddaxter But we heard a shot, and Fragile said she gave him the choice to die or be stranded on the beach, sooooo
[5:13:30] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus It was a month for them, and years for Sam.
[5:13:32] <+Caped_Eggy> Yea but all those figures are all slim, where's fatman?
[5:13:33] <laguerrilha> It was kind of lam being your friends
[5:13:33] <+Mendin> @worldbrand
[5:13:34] <peachy996> They could have been there at the beginning
[5:13:36] <@Solidus_113> It was 30 days in the real world, 40 years sitting on the Beach
[5:13:40] <+Mendin> dooms gives visionso f the future
[5:13:43] <+freeizone> when do we fight the big5
[5:13:44] <iamnotaparrot> did woolie ever do the 2nd run of RE2?
[5:13:46] <%Irridium> If they're the EE's why are they people shaped?
[5:13:48] <+linSP> you need five friends though, if you have any less you're fucked
[5:13:49] <arkv01> the real extinction event were the friends we fucked along the way
[5:13:49] <Camail> i think they're the 5 EEs
[5:13:53] <Shishi1205> The EE were not human, just the last one is
[5:13:59] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus It was a month in the real world, 40 years sitting on the Beach
[5:14:00] <derap41> How does an over production of oxygen becomes humanoid?
[5:14:06] <$laphyrion> @ireliaismaiwaifu lol, who are you even trying to impress on here?
[5:14:06] <+linSP> and remember the five BB ghosts
[5:14:08] <duskrush> You look up and one's just a big T-Rex
[5:14:12] <+07actual> Higgy DOOMSman spent eternity wandering the beach. Eventually, he stopped thinking.
[5:14:14] <blaggablag> Just hanging out in your beach, menacingly
[5:14:14] <+Mendin> We interpret things as anthropocentrics
[5:14:15] <ireliaismaiwaifu> why are you even bothering responding lol
[5:14:15] <am_omega> @Irridium They were far away so who knows what they fully looked like.
[5:14:16] <%Firgof> Oh hey porter credits
[5:14:16] <%jiggy_snipe> was there a dinosaur EE?
[5:14:17] <red_blaster> Imagine a fucking T-Rex shape in the sky the entire game.
[5:14:17] <%Grahfvitnir> The 5 figures are the EE's except at the end when it's Sam's friends
[5:14:20] <peachy996> Maybe enacting the Extinction transforms them
[5:14:21] <Tucker0603> it would give it away if the was a fucking bt T-Rex
[5:14:27] <Blackjackal95> Maybe they automatically take the visual shape of whatever the dominant sentient species is in the era
[5:14:29] <laguerrilha> Man, seating in a beach for 40 years doing nothing must have been hell
[5:14:34] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @red_blaster I would love that
[5:14:35] <Nomad94> @Tucker0603 BT-Rex
[5:14:35] <Shishi1205> we see a amonite EE and a dinosaur EE
[5:14:35] <ne0bunny> I thought the 5 floating people also could represent sam's friends that were trying to find him at the end
[5:14:36] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus It was a month in the real world, 40 years sitting on the Beach
[5:14:37] <+freeizone> by that logic then the 5 friends make way more sense, shape is humanoid
[5:14:37] <ZComiX> It’s the friends
[5:14:40] <ireliaismaiwaifu> i don't need to impress anyone if all i want is to speak the truth
[5:14:44] <duskrush> Ones a T-Rex, ones a Mammoth, one's a neanderthal
[5:14:45] <%Prevot> nothing would me more imposing than a t posing t rex
[5:14:45] <pirateofpie> I hope there's a prequel about the Dinosaur death stranding
[5:14:45] <+Axellogic> The 5 Figures were the friend me made along the way
[5:14:46] <ireliaismaiwaifu> if the truth hurts, that's your problem
[5:14:46] <derap41> Think first 3 extinctions event didn't even have multi celled life forms
[5:14:46] <Djinnazz> ALL of them happened before Humans
[5:14:48] <+linSP> damn chiral allergies :(
[5:14:49] <JDebss> Now to get that last 0.5 stars!!!
[5:14:49] <serpenttucker> No but seriously how did lou survive igor's voidout?
[5:14:49] <Camail> so wait does that mean it took 40 years for sam to give up and shoot himself
[5:14:53] <+Mariuswolf> Is there more naruto?
[5:14:54] <%fingalights> Amelia was wanting to find ultimate truth, by looking into the past.
[5:14:54] <+Caped_Eggy> Isn't all of them?
[5:14:56] <WontedFlipper5> I heard a theory that the figures in the sky are Mama, Die Hardman, Deadman etc
[5:14:56] <Zerud> They did mention humans kinda evolved to the overall looks of a EE
[5:14:58] <Tucker0603> @nomad94 ahh fuck you that's great
[5:15:00] <peachy996> Perhaps the consciousness sheds the body and becomes a proper EE when the extinction hits like it should
[5:15:01] <chronoxgp> the 5 ee's were fortnite, sekiro, control, re2 and the outer worlds
[5:15:03] <@Solidus_113> Woolie, it's not how long they were searching for Sam
[5:15:05] <$laphyrion> @ireliaismaiwaifu Lol, again. Calm down, kid. xD
[5:15:06] <VidulaSaix> It's a LOT to digest
[5:15:08] <+ConLin_Arts_> they said a month
[5:15:12] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus about 40yrs
[5:15:12] <samuraijakanddaxter> i kinda wish deadman didnt tell you about taking bb out the pod and sam just arrived there organically because those lines happening and then even being repeated made the ending a tiny bit predicatble
[5:15:14] <+Mendin> Lou was hooked up to Sasm during the voidout so he got repatriation-assisted
[5:15:15] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus It was a month in the real world, 40 years sitting on the Beach. Deadman said it was a month for them. Sam is the one who felt longer times.
[5:15:15] <Camail> serpenttucker thinking of BBs as tools lets them go through the beaches, fragile said as much
[5:15:25] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Can’t wait to see people swap out the models when the PC port launches.
[5:15:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> I think maybe Beaches have different times
[5:15:28] <Nomad94> It was more than a month, they had nothing after a month had passed
[5:15:28] <@Solidus_113> Sam spent 40 years on the beach

[5:28:11] <Axle13j> BOMB BOMB BOMB A HEAD
[5:28:13] <Doomstar16> Fun to watch
[5:28:26] <chronoxgp> i thought the genre was cool, i dunno if i'd play another one tho
[5:28:34] <GarbageNirvana> Kojima's never not gonna be smelling his own farts but yeah, overall good experience
[5:28:54] <Axle13j> This is a turn lol
[5:28:57] <+NotHereToStream> Its fine to like death stranding, but its also important to criticize it, I'm glad it exist
[5:28:58] <GarbageNirvana> We need something like this every once in a while to keep the industry from stagnating
[5:29:00] <lewdiversal> @pleasantleech Yeah, biggest flaw is some cringy lines but overall I really enjoyed it throughout. Even loved the gameplay some deem boring.
[5:29:09] <peachy996> I'd still rather Kojima smell his own farts than David Cage
[5:29:13] <mikesapartment> yo what is this song
[5:29:14] <%Grahfvitnir> Kojima at his worst is worth it for his best.
[5:29:19] <+D00msDayDan> as far as i'm concerned all that shit about EEs and the death stranding and rebuilding america is just window dressing in service of the real story, sam lou and cliff
[5:29:31] <peachy996> With Kojima there's a certain humor to his absurdity with Cage it's all played straight
[5:29:31] <GarbageNirvana> For real
[5:29:40] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The best thing about the game is how you can actually help others and how good it feels when someone helps you
[5:29:54] <+PleasantLeech> I think maybe it was a bit of a half step having things like rocket launchers and assault rifles. I'd like to see him take the theme of connection through gameplay further.
[5:29:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:30:08] <chronoxgp> I swear to god when I played, i had a fireball earth when she was walking away
[5:30:19] <%Exiliator> woolieDATTEBAYO_BW
[5:30:22] <GarbageNirvana> I feel like the guns were a concession more than anything
[5:30:30] <%DensityD> Spoilercast is gonna be good.
[5:30:41] <GarbageNirvana> Like they were only there cause people expect them in video games
[5:30:42] <+PleasantLeech> I think kojima was afraid to not have guns
[5:30:50] <chronoxgp> and I thought i heard chvrches before the incinerator and it was sunny
[5:30:51] <GarbageNirvana> Maybe
[5:31:04] <%Exiliator> But Kojima loves guns
[5:31:14] <+NotHereToStream> I think kojima is about no killing rather than pure pacifism, I mean ffs non lethal guns
[5:31:20] <Axle13j> !song
[5:31:26] <arkv01> so kojima said he'd only making movies from now on yeah?
[5:31:31] <%DensityD> He was almost very happy about getting S rank for delivering Lou to the incinerator
[5:31:38] <lewdiversal> Not only no
[5:31:46] <lewdiversal> He obviously will make games
[5:31:48] <%DensityD> but now we know the real reason that was an S rank
[5:31:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> He probably felt obligated to put in guns
[5:31:57] <chronoxgp> I shot a whole entire mule camp before the west side, I had to get a bus and take them all to the new incinerator lol
[5:32:03] <arkv01> I imagine his next work will be a movie since he just established it
[5:32:06] <$MateoPeso> They talked about making movies, manga, pretty much anythinmg
[5:32:11] <+PleasantLeech> as far as I know he only put out the idea of making movies and want very committed to it
[5:32:13] <chronoxgp> i thought'd it game over if i didn't
[5:32:13] <arkv01> hoping to see games after though
[5:32:26] <+ren173> song?
[5:32:40] <+D00msDayDan> @chronoxgp it would, but it takes 48 game hours
[5:33:02] <+D00msDayDan> and i think mules automatically get rid of bodies inside their territory anyway
[5:33:26] <GarbageNirvana> The soul still burns
[5:33:29] <chronoxgp> i thought there would be a game over, then i thought it'd be a void out
[5:33:32] <Matrixvingian> This some Soul Calibur?
[5:33:34] <arkv01> I'm down for kojima and big robots
[5:33:35] <+PleasantLeech> I'd like to see kojima make a shorter game like mgs2 again
[5:33:44] <lewdiversal> Kojima writing a manga with tite kubo drawing Kappa
[5:33:54] <arkv01> mgs2 is only short cause people speedrun it LUL
[5:34:06] <$MateoPeso> Kojima might be talking with Konami again
[5:34:13] <%Firgof> Kojima/JaBooty when
[5:34:13] <%Exiliator> SourPls
[5:34:16] <Axle13j> Song was Model 2016
[5:34:17] <chronoxgp> oh yeah about silent hills
[5:34:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I had a body get swept away in a river and voided out like 3 days later and just nuked a ton of progress, I had to stop playing for a few days from that tilt
[5:34:25] <peachy996> eh silent hills
[5:34:30] <+PleasantLeech> well on average its like what 8-10 hours?
[5:34:38] <peachy996> Talk to Akira Yamaoka and bring him back
[5:34:40] <$MateoPeso> I see a lot of Silent Hills in this game
[5:35:06] <peachy996> All the Silent Hills talk I'm hearing and I don't see Akira's name in it and that makes me sad
[5:35:31] <arkv01> well hello there handsome chads

[5:37:15] <Doomstar16> Ha ha ha
[5:37:18] <alrobot2014> but the WEDDING THO
[5:37:21] <%DensityD> what did Kojima mean by this?
[5:37:22] <peachy996> WEDDING
[5:37:22] <$MateoPeso> "Hate this bitch"
[5:37:22] <lewdiversal> Well if I think about it I barely use most of fg chars anyway Kappa
[5:37:23] <Tuna_Can_0> has wools caused a voidout ingame yet?
[5:37:26] <+Proxzo> What about gourds?

[5:37:37] <+NotHereToStream> dooms aren't really explained, just kind of shown
[5:37:40] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Frozen in stone..... Just count for 3,700 years
[5:37:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> wait how did Woolie did the math on the beach?
[5:37:53] <GarbageNirvana> So I missed how Woolie got across the lake
[5:37:55] <%DensityD> thanks einstein
[5:38:02] <+NotHereToStream> well sam use to be bb
[5:38:08] <VidulaSaix> Or perhaps due to the Stillmother connection. It's unknown exactly why
[5:38:08] <samuraijakanddaxter> its all connected
[5:38:20] <Nomad94> Basically
[5:38:24] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[5:38:25] <peachy996> Connecting to your previous memories as a BB when connecting to a BB
[5:38:26] <+drfaustisdead> people who Dooms cause feedback loops when they connect to BB's
[5:38:31] <+Axellogic> Wouldnt it be as simple as he's connecting to a bb so it awakens your bb memories
[5:38:31] <lewdiversal> Correct
[5:38:35] <mikesapartment> He didn't know you were his true bb
[5:38:35] <samuraijakanddaxter> thats why he was hugging you?
[5:38:40] <VidulaSaix> He knew his BB was there but I don't think he knew it was you at first
[5:38:40] <peachy996> Every time he hugs you, you get the memories
[5:38:41] <Tuna_Can_0> @GarbageNirvana After Vietnam he literally just appears there and someone carries him to the nearest shelter
[5:39:07] <arkv01> isn't BB sam's biological kid? I thought sam gave birth during his coma...
[5:39:17] <Nomad94> wat
[5:39:18] <+NotHereToStream> BB aka lou is a random bb
[5:39:19] <VidulaSaix> @arkv01 ... what? LUL
[5:39:24] <@Solidus_113> Mpreg?
[5:39:24] <Djinnazz> ??
[5:39:32] <am_omega> @arkv01 Bruh what?
[5:39:38] <samuraijakanddaxter> wait what
[5:39:46] <arkv01> oh uh... guess it was just my fever dream
[5:39:46] <@Solidus_113> I think you can customize your outfit colour now too @WoolieVersus
[5:39:55] <GarbageNirvana> @this_is_marco Sorry, meant the distro center where you fight Higgs
[5:39:57] <+NotHereToStream> the lucy interview says alot about sams background
[5:40:02] <VidulaSaix> There is one email that talks about Sams wife but Im not sure how to get it @WoolieVersus
[5:40:04] <VidulaSaix> Chat do you know?
[5:40:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> his wife has interviews but its tricky to unlock
[5:40:15] <@Solidus_113> you have to do deliveries
[5:40:21] <ne0bunny> you need to unlock and read all the reports
[5:40:29] <+NotHereToStream> you might aswell look online for those interviews
[5:40:31] <Tuna_Can_0> @GarbageNirvana Like what happens after he gets there? Or how he got there?
[5:40:33] <GarbageNirvana> Or whatever it was called
[5:40:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because the unlocks for all the wife interviews is on specific deliveries
[5:40:38] <GarbageNirvana> How he got there
[5:40:39] <arkv01> ohhh yeaaaah sam spray it
[5:40:49] <+PleasantLeech> wait I unlocked that and didn't even 100 percent the game
[5:40:50] <vincerocmm> drink
[5:40:52] <GarbageNirvana> Like did he purposefully void out or
[5:40:56] <%fingalights> Chug em all
[5:41:00] <VidulaSaix> The wife interviews is some fucked shit. i'd REALLY recommend you look those up, even if its off camera @WoolieVersus
[5:41:05] <+drfaustisdead> Higgs is literally the Stick and Sam the Strand.
[5:41:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> mostly deliveries for heartman or from heartman unlocks the wife files
[5:41:15] <samuraijakanddaxter> did you notice when fragile teleported sam one last time and deadman was standing between them it looked like a wedding, very subtle
[5:41:21] <+linSP> remember the end of the 'nam segment you hear a gunshot then cliff vanishes
[5:41:23] <blaggablag> She's still an asshole
[5:41:27] <Tuna_Can_0> @GarbageNirvana Theres the Vietnam bit with Cliff, then Sam literally drops just outside the Distro center and he wakes up in the Private room
[5:41:35] <arkv01> @samuraijakanddaxter it sure did, and fragile was the minister
[5:41:41] <serpenttucker> Seems kinda silly that the extinction of several species is tied to the will of 1 membeer of the species.
[5:41:45] <Tuna_Can_0> @GarbageNirvana kinda handwaves the whole boat trip
[5:41:47] <GarbageNirvana> I must be thinking of something different then
[5:41:48] <serpenttucker> *member
[5:41:51] <+drfaustisdead> She was speeding up the inevitable.
[5:42:07] <VidulaSaix> ^
[5:42:17] <+NotHereToStream> She's a strange case
[5:42:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I think she became a more complicated stra
[5:42:20] <arkv01> hey sometimes you fuck fight ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[5:42:23] <VidulaSaix> It's not tied to their will serpent
[5:42:26] <VidulaSaix> It WILL happen 100%
[5:42:32] <peachy996> She's a bit of a mess
[5:42:33] <Reizie_Etherealm> One of the main reason why she wants to speed it up is cause she don't want to stay around longer than she has to right?
[5:42:35] <am_omega> I feel like Bridget did not show any love to anyone. Amelie feels like she showed more love.
[5:42:36] <GarbageNirvana> She still a ho
[5:42:37] <gunsrlove> Are the 100 000 years a known thing, or was that just a random mention
[5:42:39] <VidulaSaix> WEDDING
[5:42:39] <@Solidus_113> Was the EE just a case of existentialism?
[5:42:42] <ne0bunny> Its funny how Mama talks about having memories from when she and her sis were in the womb, and everyone playing calls BS. But Sam had been technically having womb memories all this time!
[5:42:50] <gunsrlove> because what if there is an EE , but humanity has spread to space >
[5:42:50] <+NotHereToStream> Her entire point was fuck it, end this stupid shit show
[5:42:57] <serpenttucker> @VidulaSaix But the fact that it can even be put off, post poned, or fastforwarded means she clearly has some control over it.
[5:43:00] <arkv01> @Solidus_113 probably kojima trying to deal with his mortality now that he's in his 50s
[5:43:01] <gunsrlove> Are you going to Death Stranding mulitple planets?
[5:43:04] <GarbageNirvana> Maybe it was the whole being a body without a soul thing
[5:43:07] <Reizie_Etherealm> FETUS DELETUS
[5:43:08] <gunsrlove> There is no time fall in SPACE
[5:43:13] <Axle13j> Fetus Deletus
[5:43:15] <+therabbles> Norman Yeetus and the Funky Fetus
[5:43:17] <VidulaSaix> It's implied that some force just causes a member of the species to be born as the EE which is almost like a beacon to start to Death Stranding in that era @Solidus_113
[5:43:19] <peachy996> She Deletus Feetus and was big Regreetus
[5:43:20] <VidulaSaix> That's how I took it
[5:43:27] <+07actual> So a death stranding is like human instrumentality?
[5:43:27] <gunsrlove> So, this bitch better get to Exctincting, before we hit space travel
[5:43:28] <serpenttucker> I see what you mean though
[5:43:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I think its because Amelie was a human EE
[5:43:33] <duskrush> When your purpose is extinction I guess murder isn't as big a deal
[5:43:34] <+NotHereToStream> yo did you ever notice every kojima game main character has a missing father figure, like big boss to snake as to cliff to sam
[5:43:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the other ones can suffer but Amelie had humanity to work with and a conscience.
[5:43:56] <%Irridium> so what would have happened if she, like, died as a kid or something. Before her soul got relegated to the beach
[5:43:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:43:57] <peachy996> But in her view the end is coming so soon that she doesn't care who she hurts
[5:44:09] <+drfaustisdead> Bringing Sam back caused the death stranding.
[5:44:10] <peachy996> Not much anyway
[5:44:11] <ZComiX> Woolie I got a question for you. Do you believe Diehardman?
[5:44:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> so having constant nightmares must not be super nice to live with for a 100000 years
[5:44:15] <VidulaSaix> YEYEYEYEYE
[5:44:17] <@Solidus_113> @NotHereToStream that's because his dad died when he was young

[6:04:02] <kennyfz> Kojima broke Woolie
[6:04:02] <%Irridium> A Bridge is a Strand that takes you over Cliffs

[6:06:04] <%Prevot> another freakout incoming
[6:06:06] <+secretmaterial> fuck subtlety
[6:06:08] <Explodincatz> C O W A R D
[6:06:08] <aames> He's not trying to be subtle
[6:06:13] <%Solidnick18> It means knot
[6:06:16] <Nomad94> LUL
[6:06:17] <%Firgof> Quipu is knot. Knots are made of strands. Strands are BEACHES.
[6:06:17] <+therabbles> supertext is powerful
[6:06:20] <%Firgof> Everything is beaches.
[6:06:21] <ALTRNico> it's not that important
[6:06:24] <KaitlynnHere> Since when was kojima subtle?
[6:06:24] <+Razputin217> COWARDS USE SUBTELTY
[6:06:25] <$MateoPeso> A KNOT IN A ROPE
[6:06:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @woolieversus do u want Kojima to be subtle? Can you even take Kojima's 100% subtlety?
[6:06:27] <ne0bunny> @Nomad94 yeah its also a movie ref
[6:06:38] <%jiggy_snipe> connections Kappa
[6:06:40] <$MateoPeso> STICK WAS ROPE
[6:06:41] <duskrush> Did you tell him about UNCLE SAM?
[6:06:46] <Nomad94> Now they have SUPERmeaning
[6:06:46] <arkv01> kojima's dad jokes
[6:06:51] <VidulaSaix> Woolie, Kojima spells this shit out harder than it's EVER been and people STILL don't get it.
[6:06:57] <eldragon_1> I can't wait for Kojima's movies LUL
[6:06:59] <+drfaustisdead> All connections have meaning Woolie, that's what the who game is about.
[6:07:01] <%tattleworm> kojima pre-emptively murders the concept of death of the writer
[6:07:02] <%Solidnick18> kojima is super dad
[6:07:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WOOLIE MGS2 HAPPENED
[6:07:05] <+NotHereToStream> if kojima is subtlety, then will understand nothing he writes
[6:07:05] <ALTRNico> but you LOVE it tho
[6:07:06] <+Ancopro> Mumbo Kojumbo
[6:07:07] <+drfaustisdead> whole
[6:07:18] <%jiggy_snipe> @VidulaSaix what do you mean? he said nukes are good right?
[6:07:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Wow that undid all that goodwill from that ending
[6:07:23] <%Irridium> I wonder if this is Kojima's reaction to people saying Metal Gear isn't political
[6:07:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> remember when MGS2 was him being subtle and it flew over the majorities' head?!
[6:07:24] <arkv01> kojimmy will never stop until everyone on twitter calls him daddy
[6:07:25] <samuraijakanddaxter> die hardmans full name is john mcclane, like bruce willis name in die hard
[6:07:32] <%Firgof> but woolie

[6:07:35] <%Firgof> the pizza
[6:07:39] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[6:07:43] <zenith0111> Incas history were basically wiped out by the Spaniards and all we know about them is a few things like Strands and Quipus
[6:07:44] <ZComiX> Darkness Ebony Rose Woolie
[6:07:45] <iosephe> But it fits so well
[6:07:55] <+NotHereToStream> bruh the only reason mgs universe exist because the boss's will was subtlety and was misinterpreted by two individual LUL
[6:08:02] <Nomad94> Subtlety is for COWARDS
[6:08:02] <+drfaustisdead> You know what you were getting Woolie.
[6:08:03] <$MateoPeso> Take this over David Cage
[6:08:05] <+Proxzo> Die Hardman's Real name: John Blake McClane
[6:08:05] <ALTRNico> is Woolie telling the universal truth?
[6:08:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I just want you to realize that MGS2 wasnt appreciated until like years later because people DIDNT GET IT
[6:08:10] <+NotHereToStream> why the fuck do you think kojumbo hates subtlety
[6:08:10] <VidulaSaix> ^
[6:08:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> PERMEATES ALL EXISTENCE
[6:08:16] <blaggablag> oh THATS WHAT STRAANDBEEST MEANS
[6:08:20] <%Firgof> Kojima is the Universal Truth that woolie wishes he didn't know
[6:08:21] <VidulaSaix> I repeat, Kojima spells this shit out harder than it's EVER been and people STILL don't get it.
[6:08:22] <+CapraCreep> Does that mean this game can be called Death Beach because that's where people go when they die
[6:08:23] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[6:08:26] <%Prevot> "I'm Woolie, but I'm not that wooly."
[6:08:26] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> 12D chess
[6:08:27] <%Solidnick18> but
[6:08:33] <zenith0111> @vidulasaix Right?
[6:08:36] <serpenttucker> Man imagine if the boss' will had no subtext to it LUL
[6:08:37] <xiccy> Diehardman's full name is John McLane like three movie Die Hard.
[6:08:41] <MayorRev> Are you getting mad at us or Kojima? @WoolieVersus
[6:08:41] <%Exiliator> For a game with so muich fatherhood themes, it being 99% dadpuns is pretty apt honestly
[6:08:43] <blaggablag> ohnooo
[6:08:44] <zenith0111> That's the point though....
[6:08:45] <arkv01> kojimas daddy milk
[6:08:47] <%DensityD> trust me, if he does it 15 more times, it cycles back to being amazing
[6:08:53] <$MateoPeso> But now we have yogart
[6:08:53] <duskrush> Lockne and Malingen are the names of two twin craters
[6:08:54] <noneedtoask> What about the extinction as an analogy for Kojima leaving Konami?
[6:08:54] <VidulaSaix> It's not a trick
[6:08:55] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[6:09:00] <Kalinflip> You done woolie
[6:09:00] <peachy996> The best cake is nothing but frosting
[6:09:02] <Kalinflip> atpCap
[6:09:03] <vVAstrAVv> or is it STRANDING all the fun out reggie
[6:09:04] <ALTRNico> it works tho
[6:09:04] <+Razputin217> The GRASS IS DEAD WHERE WE FUCKED, TOM
[6:09:06] <%Solidnick18> kojimas loves his did you know facts
[6:09:13] <ZComiX> Whats XOF Woolie?
[6:09:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Reggie is loving this
[6:09:13] <Kalinflip> i do too
[6:09:14] <OldManDeckardCain> QUIPU MEANS FUCK YOU
[6:09:17] <lewdiversal> Lockne and malingen are twin craters @woolieversus
[6:09:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's not a trick, it's a brand at this point
[6:09:18] <%Firgof> woolie's just going to throttle reggie while yelling dad jokes
[6:09:19] <zenith0111> Woolie is angry at very basic symbolism
[6:09:27] <+therabbles> literally describing plot metaphor in game
[6:09:27] <arkv01> sometimes I really wonde rhow amazing kojima's cock would be inside me as he asks me "does it fit?"
[6:09:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie might not be a Kojima fan anymore but Reggie is ALL IN
[6:09:45] <%jiggy_snipe> so there may be another reference to Die Hardman's name
[6:09:53] <noneedtoask> @WoolieVersus hey woolie do you know what they would call it when the chiral artist and the junk dealer get married? tying the knot
[6:10:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Kojima teaching English
[6:10:02] <BearSawed> Hes not angry at the symbolism, just the frequency of said symbolism
[6:10:05] <OldManDeckardCain> sam also means "alone" in polish Kappa
[6:10:05] <arkv01> I passionately await reggie's solo stream of all the MGS games
[6:10:06] <%DatAsuna> Onions have layers, woolie
[6:10:15] <masterfire23> uncle SAM
[6:10:16] <VidulaSaix> Sam also means Uncle Sam
[6:10:18] <VidulaSaix> 4Head
[6:10:25] <+NotHereToStream> i look forward to the stupid ass name kojima makes in his next game LUL
[6:10:28] <%DatAsuna> just like the buttons in mario
[6:10:36] <%DatAsuna> and she calls herself princess beach
[6:10:38] <%DatAsuna> like mario
[6:10:40] <%The_Timo> I feel like Kojima took a creative writing class once and felt like he understood everything he needed to know in that once 2 hour class.
[6:10:42] <%Firgof> You'll never see the pizza cooomiiiiiing
[6:10:42] <Nomad94> Yes they do
[6:10:49] <lewdiversal> We had it good with solid snake and liquid Kappa
[6:10:53] <samuraijakanddaxter> it's not really symbolism when they just fuckin hit you over the head with it all it's just words
[6:10:53] <VidulaSaix> Reggie what have you done LUL
[6:10:55] <+BioHunter> they dont have flavor or u dont have taste?
[6:10:55] <%Solidnick18> bland
[6:10:56] <+Proxzo> Higg's last name means Hills
[6:11:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FATMAN IS FAT AND LOVES BOMBS
[6:11:01] <%Exiliator> You drank so much of the kool-aid, you grew immune to the poison
[6:11:01] <arkv01> to be fair Japan's level of english literacy is less than most third world countries and he sees himself as an english god with this stuff
[6:11:04] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> New English tech to madden hoes
[6:11:05] <noneedtoask> tea cakes exist for that reason though

[6:14:42] <Kalinflip> Its ok woolie
[6:14:45] <zenith0111> Idk there are a lot of other story things to complain about most of this is just stuff to explain things they otherwise wouldn't in cutscenes
[6:14:49] <imthewisejanitor> @Irridium Hell yeah. I just needed to know if they followed through. Thanks, looking forward to it!
[6:15:02] <+PleasantLeech> knecro lol
[6:15:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie unsubscribes from UNIVERSAL TRUTH
[6:15:20] <duskrush> The 5 extinctions are Devonian, Permian, Ordovician, Triassic-Jurassic, and K-T
[6:15:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he cant handle Kojima's truth
[6:15:26] <+linSP> higgs?
[6:15:31] <ALTRNico> Kojima now sits on the chair
[6:15:36] <%jiggy_snipe> Fragile has DOOMs too and I don't think she met Amelie
[6:15:44] <Cykron> Wow this is still happening lol
[6:15:45] <arkv01> Higgs is ALL about the GGPO
[6:15:45] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Memory Chip #55 – An Unknown Man’s Journal Part 2 – In the abandoned BT town southwest of Junk Dealer, you have to go there to collect parts for him during the story. The memory chip is on the back of a car, on an old street.
[6:16:03] <noneedtoask> K-T would also be cretaceous
[6:16:05] <Nomad94> ^
[6:16:25] <Cykron> When postmen go postal
[6:16:28] <masterfire23> i want kojima and araki to create a piece of content
[6:16:38] <$MateoPeso> Youtube exclusive?
[6:16:47] <VidulaSaix> No yopu can go get it
[6:16:50] <zenith0111> Higgs leaves the chips in super obvious spots. It was hard to miss.
[6:16:51] <+agumon9000> No you can get it any time
[6:16:51] <Nomad94> No, it's always there
[6:16:54] <%tattleworm> p sure you can do it anytime
[6:16:58] <+drfaustisdead> you can't miss anything in the game.
[6:17:00] <%Irridium> no you can still get it. It's the town just north of south knot city
[6:17:01] <zenith0111> Some right in front of Knots
[6:17:16] <Doomstar16> Woah
[6:17:19] <+D00msDayDan> no the chip is still there just go grab it
[6:17:19] <ne0bunny> I don't think any chips are missable
[6:17:29] <Sogeki_Dan> Did you know Amelie used Higgs but in the end you used Huggs on Amelie
[6:17:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Turn it off and pick up a thesaurus
[6:18:01] <arkv01> @Sogeki_Dan sir the guillotine has a line, stop trying to cut
[6:18:14] <kulmoth> @Sogeki_Dan fuck you for making this thought
[6:18:20] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[6:18:26] <Cykron> Higgs saw the porn
[6:18:28] <Nomad94> oof
[6:18:30] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[6:18:33] <Sogeki_Dan> psaDab
[6:18:33] <Kalinflip> its all connected guys atpCap
[6:18:41] <zenith0111> Higgs was getting Black Pilled as a child
[6:18:46] <$MateoPeso> He had a bad childhood
[6:18:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Oh right these are fucked
[6:18:51] <zenith0111> Rip innocence
[6:19:08] <Cykron> Bop your Bunker Baby
[6:19:22] <Cykron> The first BB
[6:19:22] <+D00msDayDan> higgs is a bunker baby that grew up on video games. never strust gamers.
[6:19:33] <samuraijakanddaxter> so here's your higgs backstory
[6:19:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[6:19:46] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Rise up Gamers
[6:19:48] <%Prevot> monkaS
[6:19:50] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO
[6:20:06] <Cykron> Incel gamer escapes the basement
[6:20:07] <noneedtoask> did you know you can call your mother kaa-san or haha
[6:20:20] <kulmoth> STOP
[6:20:28] <zenith0111> This backstory is to explain Higgs nihilistic philosophy
[6:20:29] <@Solidus_113> Does this change your video request?
[6:20:30] <ALTRNico> no keep going
[6:20:31] <Axle13j> Dayum
[6:20:35] <kulmoth> stop making us aware of more dumb puns
[6:20:36] <%DatAsuna> "bruh"
[6:20:37] <@Solidus_113> Higgs is no knife licker
[6:20:38] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> VoteYea
[6:20:39] <kulmoth> NotLikeThis
[6:20:43] <Kalinflip> Woolie when will read Edgar allen poe for us
[6:20:49] <GarbageNirvana> So he was raised by a fat evil huh
[6:21:25] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I'm going to kill everyone and then myself
[6:21:31] <peachy996> Environment of staying inside can be super poisonous if you live with crazy people
[6:21:47] <Cykron> He had a fucked up childhood but it all changed after discovering Shadow the Hedgehog
[6:22:09] <ALTRNico> @raaaaainmaker I'm going to extinct humanity
[6:22:35] <duskrush> So you get DOOMS through murder?
[6:22:36] <zenith0111> Cynicism and Nihilism is a deadly combo.
[6:22:40] <%jiggy_snipe> well there you go Woolie
[6:22:47] <VidulaSaix> Always wait till we got the full story VoHiYo
[6:22:54] <+drfaustisdead> This new version of down wake daddy is odd.
[6:23:02] <nothuzad> love murder - big happy
[6:23:06] <samuraijakanddaxter> so now imagine somebody comes along and promises this person power beyond their wildest dreams, and can actually deliver on that promise
[6:23:20] <@Solidus_113> Japanese writing of repeating one word
[6:23:26] <VidulaSaix> Sometimes things get lost in translation and it sucks
[6:23:29] <Nomad94> I love those moments
[6:23:33] <%tattleworm> this chair
[6:23:35] <+D00msDayDan> it's a japanese trope
[6:23:38] <arkv01> G O U R D
[6:23:40] <+NotHereToStream> usotsukiya
[6:23:49] <Reizie_Etherealm> He kept saying his fucking pain I had forgotten what other words had sounded like before his fucking pain were repeated as he said his fucking pain
[6:24:02] <Cykron> Balloon, gotta get the Balloon
[6:24:23] <+linSP> a whole paragraph of the same word monkaS
[6:24:33] <%DensityD> Woolie thinks he is big brain, but actually.......
[6:24:37] <Axle13j> Yup
[6:24:38] <%DensityD> he might be
[6:24:42] <Nomad94> Yuri's poems in Doki Doki Literature Club do this in the end
[6:24:43] <zenith0111> Remember if Kojima does well give him no credit but if he fucks up blame him 100%....
[6:24:50] <nothuzad> depends on the intention
[6:24:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Its like when you write your crush's name hundreds of times and then they find your notebook
[6:25:02] <+NotHereToStream> i wonder if this is the same in the Japanese version
[6:25:02] <VidulaSaix> When it's read this way, I can picture this in Higgs voice
[6:25:05] <VidulaSaix> As inner monologue
[6:25:05] <peachy996> I'm Covered in Bees!
[6:25:09] <nothuzad> going into shitty mental holes is a lot of just repeating things
[6:25:09] <%Wool> WOOLIE'S STILL PLAYING DEATH STRANDING?
[6:25:17] <Nomad94> @Wool Postgame now
[6:25:17] <%Wool> Has he been playing for 6 hours straight???

[6:25:23] <alrobot2014> yessir
[6:25:25] <Nomad94> and pretty much yes
[6:25:26] <duskrush> No one tell Woolie about the pizza guy's name reference

[6:25:31] <VidulaSaix> And with that we're done unless you wanna grab those last journals
[6:25:32] <%Irridium> @Wool yeah the end's like that

[6:30:01] <VidulaSaix> @chesterr01 There's a ton of interviews with Sam's wife as well that are kind of a pain to get. I can DM them to you if you guys wanna check it out or Woolie can just do that on his own time
[6:30:02] <Tuna_Can_0> @WoolieVersus Hug a BT for science :)
[6:30:03] <@Solidus_113> This is the rawest Kojima
[6:30:05] <peachy996> The Fetus is Pleased-us
[6:30:06] <zenith0111> Louise BibleThump
[6:30:06] <Kalinflip> he is
[6:30:07] <Reizie_Etherealm> Now all he needs to do is to tuck the hair back
[6:30:19] <Nomad94> @WoolieVersus Also Sam's hair isn't tidy anymore since he cut his ties to Bridges
[6:30:21] <Overloard> KappaPride
[6:30:24] <zenith0111> Woolie never seen a baby confirmed
[6:30:25] <Nomad94> in the end
[6:30:25] <@Solidus_113> Journals are the memory chip
[6:30:25] <+NotHereToStream> reminds me of the silent hills thing
[6:30:34] <GarbageNirvana> I mean what do you expect, she was taken from the womb of a braindead woman
[6:30:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I loved blue is the warmest color, fragile is great as blue
[6:30:37] <Zayasu> man granblue looks so good Kreygasm
[6:30:39] <VidulaSaix> She has 13 total interviews
[6:30:42] <@Solidus_113> there's more interviews that come with extra deliveries
[6:30:42] <VidulaSaix> I can just link it to you
[6:30:54] <Djinnazz> you can do it off stream
[6:30:55] <+NotHereToStream> just look em up if you feel done with this
[6:31:00] <duskrush> I'm cool with it if you want to tap out
[6:31:01] <nothuzad> you can youtube them or do it off stream
[6:31:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> just do it offstream
[6:31:03] <ALTRNico> might as well platinum the game
[6:31:05] <Matrixvingian> Push it to the RIMIT!
[6:31:06] <VidulaSaix> Or just check it out on your own time and discuss it on the spoilercast
[6:31:07] <%Solidnick18> tooo much
[6:31:09] <%tattleworm> also just doing deliveries of other kinds in this chapter unlocks even more stuff, you're better off just looking them up
[6:31:12] <+Axellogic> I mean yeah they're just text
[6:31:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> since some mails come up as you play the game again
[6:31:18] <am_omega> 100% time boyz
[6:31:19] <GarbageNirvana> Offstream cleanup is probably the way to go from here
[6:31:25] <peachy996> Call it a stream, it's 7 hours
[6:31:26] <Matrixvingian> Burnt out in a sleeping pile to this monstrousity of auteur madness.
[6:31:26] <ne0bunny> the orders themselves are pretty basic, you are best just reading them online
[6:31:27] <%Solidnick18> meh
[6:31:28] <VidulaSaix> Its not worth an extra session
[6:31:30] <Djinnazz> Naw
[6:31:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> Read with Norman Read-us on AMC
[6:31:34] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Its not
[6:31:35] <zenith0111> Damn I missed Woolies whole reactions today
[6:31:43] <VidulaSaix> They're good interviews but not worth a wasted day
[6:32:03] <Ipsenscastle> Ditch it, move on to something new
[6:32:06] <Nomad94> This session is gonna be so many LP parts

[6:34:54] <am_omega> Oh yeah I forgot now its the homeless shitting in the streets Kappa
[6:34:58] <+PleasantLeech> the first one is really underrated
[6:35:01] <ALTRNico> D:
[6:35:04] <zenith0111> YOU NEED TO SEE THE FIRST ONE
[6:35:07] <+drfaustisdead> do not be drawn in by the the allure of water. Less you resent it's absence.
[6:35:12] <%Prevot> uncultured woolie
[6:35:14] <alrobot2014> so reggie needs to watch shape of water and woolie needs to see mad max
[6:35:15] <peachy996> I thought the first one was boring but I was a kid so it didn't connect
[6:35:16] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Water will be a preium resource in 20 years according to that netflix doco
[6:35:19] <arkv01> that "ohhhh" LUL, reggie callin woolie out for being uncultured swine
[6:35:21] <duskrush> The first one doesn't even look post apocalyptic compared to the others
[6:35:32] <serpenttucker> LUL
[6:35:32] <samuraijakanddaxter> you haven't seen DEATH NOTE???!!
[6:35:37] <+Razputin217> Can't we get beyond Thunderdome?
[6:35:45] <zenith0111> Shoutouts to Mr.Potatohead BlessRNG
[6:35:46] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Memory Chip #55 – An Unknown Man’s Journal Part 2 – In the abandoned BT town southwest of Junk Dealer, you have to go there to collect parts for him during the story. The memory chip is on the back of a car, on an old street.
[6:35:46] <@Solidus_113> It's around the collaped bridge
[6:35:46] <alrobot2014> mad max and the shape of water sounds like a movie of its own
[6:35:51] <%Irridium> it's that road there yeah
[6:35:52] <+drfaustisdead> Reggie Thunderdome only gets bad when the kids show up.
[6:35:52] <serpenttucker> I didn't hate beyond the thunderdome
[6:36:02] <zenith0111> Listen to Spam-man Kappa
[6:36:28] <@Solidus_113> also, @chesterr01 @WoolieVersus here's the list of interviews about Sam's wife: https://deathstranding.fandom.com/wiki/Interviews#Lucy.27s_Report
[6:36:40] <VidulaSaix> ^
[6:36:53] <Kalinflip> I love my wife
[6:36:55] <%Irridium> It's just north of where you are
[6:37:07] <Kalinflip> he name is uhhh ropeia stand bridges
[6:37:08] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Look what chips you're missing then look up a numberedchip map
[6:37:11] <zenith0111> Sams wife gives so much context to Sams character that I'm upset she wasn't mentioned in more cutscenes
[6:37:24] <%Brightstreak> Holy sheet! I think this is the first i've caught you guys live. I'm legit starstruck RN
[6:37:26] <VidulaSaix> Yeah Lucy's Reports are actually really damn good
[6:37:30] <VidulaSaix> Surprised they're so buried
[6:38:07] <+drfaustisdead> be kind drop a sign.
[6:38:15] <emeraldskrull> if only minh was there to get dunked on woolieDATTEBAYO
[6:38:21] <peachy996> Is it true what Pat said about Amelie and Lucy near the end of his Death Stranding Stream?
[6:38:25] <zenith0111> Even explains "Ground Zero"
[6:38:44] <zenith0111> @peachy996 That he hates her? LUL
[6:38:52] <VidulaSaix> Dunno, I had to stop watching Pats after his wouldn't stop baby raging over Amelie's reasoning
[6:38:58] <VidulaSaix> Cause he refused to understand it
[6:39:00] <VidulaSaix> NotLikeThis
[6:39:11] <+agumon9000> The spoilercast
[6:39:16] <+agumon9000> is going to be super interesting
[6:39:16] <VidulaSaix> It's gonna be glorious
[6:39:21] <peachy996> No about Amelie having a part in the Lucy situation
[6:39:22] <serpenttucker> I did not watch his stream, what was his baby reasons for hating it?
[6:39:25] <+D00msDayDan> i think he reached a point where he understood it, he just hated it because the amelie shit's dumb
[6:39:27] <peachy996> Or did he mis-hear it
[6:39:30] <VidulaSaix> They dont know that yet peachy
[6:39:30] <zenith0111> Pat doesn't understand irrational behavior. In fact most media consumers can't
[6:39:34] <VidulaSaix> So lets not talk about it
[6:39:34] <%wydamn> @vidulasaix it's going to be an interesting Spoilercast
[6:39:42] <peachy996> Ah
[6:39:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I just got to the convo with Ciri in Witcher 3 where she describes Cyberpunk
[6:40:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is Sam's filler arc

[6:40:03] <peachy996> Well then no FUCK AMELIE, I stand by my disdain of her
[6:40:10] <arsonistdaria> this is actually the same thing holding up the iowa caucus
[6:40:15] <VidulaSaix> It's more fuck Bridget than Amelia
[6:40:22] <VidulaSaix> Bridget was the one that went way too hard

[6:42:28] <vVAstrAVv> at least void out for your hubris
[6:42:28] <+NotHereToStream> bring a shotgun, they melt bt bosses like they are nothing
[6:42:29] <+agumon9000> Getting the last Higgs Journal
[6:42:34] <VidulaSaix> And potentially reading Lucy's off the wiki
[6:42:37] <serpenttucker> @VidulaSaix If I know I have to go through an area multiple times. I just fight the boss BT for that area to clear up the weather and BTs
[6:42:45] <Axle13j> Yea true
[6:42:51] <zenith0111> Does woolie think scanning reveals them still?
[6:42:52] <Zayasu> cant they just look it up? LUL
[6:42:55] <$MateoPeso> Did Woolie turn off the BT warning
[6:43:02] <+D00msDayDan> @serpenttucker that only lasts for 10 minutes, if you just kill individual gazers they'll stay gone for longer
[6:43:04] <%jiggy_snipe> they should just read it off the wiki
[6:43:08] <VidulaSaix> He's gonna have to look up Lucy's cause hers require investment
[6:43:22] <VidulaSaix> Solidus posted a link earlier to them
[6:43:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> still playing?
[6:43:26] <serpenttucker> @D00msDayDan Really? It felt a lot longer to me.
[6:43:36] <Psyramics> I left for a bit, is he doing completionist shit now?
[6:43:40] <Axle13j> Sure they can, but he clearly wants to play
[6:43:55] <grenadier42> is gbvs still happening?
[6:43:59] <$MateoPeso> I think they show up with an icon
[6:44:09] <+D00msDayDan> @serpenttucker probably varies with the area, when i cleared the crater town BTs repopped before i could finish looting the place
[6:44:09] <+drfaustisdead> they do have icons.
[6:44:10] <+NotHereToStream> yup, just gotta scan
[6:44:35] <+NotHereToStream> not haul your ass
[6:44:40] <+drfaustisdead> Woolie should leave a sign.
[6:44:41] <+NotHereToStream> now*
[6:45:06] <+D00msDayDan> i swear signs for chips don't actually appear in other peoples games, all of mine have 0 likes to this day
[6:45:07] <Reizie_Etherealm> The only sign that matters is SIGN HERE
[6:45:14] <VidulaSaix> Sign here please
[6:45:35] <serpenttucker> @D00msDayDan See I cleared the boss for the abandoned factory south of the crater and I was able to do multiple circuits between the distro centers

[6:52:33] <happyface699> I knew artists who used subtext they were cowards
[6:52:42] <+SmortyPuffin> is this post-game cleanup, or has he not finished the game yet?

[6:53:07] <tiaramaki> Nah, I'm still here
[6:53:23] <VidulaSaix> Yeah finding these when you could in chapter 3 is nuts

[6:54:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yeah it only gets named when you find out Higgs is Peter
[6:54:06] <+edibleskeleton> feel bad for me because sad childhood

[6:56:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Higgs is sucha dork
[6:56:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> See when you find this early on, I thought it was Sam
[6:56:40] <happyface699> CHAOS
[6:56:43] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[6:56:43] <eljuanito1989> Check the toys behind Sam! BabyRage
[6:56:48] <Kalinflip> FINeto
[6:56:48] <arkv01> higgs is the most loveable incel once you read these
[6:57:05] <peachy996> All Knife Lickers have journies
[6:57:06] <+CptBritches> I actually ended up liking Higgs a lot
[6:57:06] <+edibleskeleton> wow society has rules and laws to function that's crazy man
[6:57:07] <zenith0111> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Sam? LUL I thought maybe Clifford or Higgs if anything
[6:57:15] <ALTRNico> reggie was right all along
[6:57:15] <+NotHereToStream> I mean its hidden too
[6:57:18] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus he only licks knives around you because he wants to look like a cool villain from his videogames
[6:57:24] <Kalinflip> ^^
[6:57:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I thought it was Sam and hes jealous because of this
[6:57:27] <+edibleskeleton> like everything else in this game read it don't show it
[6:57:32] <peachy996> You don't just look at a knife pick it up and go "this looks tasty"
[6:57:32] <eljuanito1989> it's not Troy Baker
[6:57:33] <arkv01> higgs has american chuunibyou
[6:57:42] <+linSP> kojima is a psaBig teller
[6:57:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Higgs is sucha dork and I love it
[6:57:53] <eljuanito1989> Troy Bake-man
[6:57:56] <%DatAsuna> Some people apply that to a fault, but even if you do tell, tell when relevant, not hours after it's gone
[6:58:01] <+D00msDayDan> higgs is a massive dweeb there should have been a QTE to give him a wedgie and shove him in a chiral locker
[6:58:08] <Djinnazz> that would take hours
[6:58:08] <$MateoPeso> Only had so much money
[6:58:09] <happyface699> I would’ve appreciated this game actually having cutscenes about Higgs development
[6:58:10] <VidulaSaix> I dunno about SEEING it but I'd love to hear him voice it
[6:58:11] <+NotHereToStream> I too want to see troy baker get beaten up Kappa
[6:58:13] <+D00msDayDan> dunk his head in a tar toilet
[6:58:16] <jorniev> but how do you show that
[6:58:18] <zenith0111> It would over shadow Sam
[6:58:18] <eljuanito1989> Bake Troy Man
[6:58:19] <%Irridium> that sounds like a lot of extra cutscenes
[6:58:20] <arkv01> higgs actually has the deepest lore out of the entire cast
[6:58:22] <+CptBritches> A lot of people already complain about Kojima putting too many cutscenes in and every game has a budget
[6:58:28] <+MajorCrasher> how would you put that into the game organically though? @woolieversus
[6:58:28] <arkv01> pizzaman, childhood abuse, megalomania
[6:58:29] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus It's the same problem as the B&Bs even if you're fine with the tell over show, it's telling late that hurts it more
[6:58:36] <Nomad94> Good idea, put even MORE cutscenes in this game
[6:58:36] <jorniev> you cant show that from your own perspective
[6:58:41] <+SirGO0SE> LUL
[6:58:43] <arkv01> I mean it ran outta money but then xenosaga happened
[6:58:45] <happyface699> Too much telling
[6:58:56] <eljuanito1989> Check Sam's toys!
[6:59:02] <peachy996> Cutscene to Game ratio is better than Phantom Pain and MGS4 so I'd like to think he's improving on that at least
[6:59:04] <arkv01> and xenosaga is the dumbest fuckin fun you can have in the ps2 generation
[6:59:04] <+chaumiester> I loved XenoGears...
[6:59:04] <zenith0111> @cptbritches This game is just a little longer than MGS4 and people hated MGS4s length
[6:59:04] <Maids4lyfe> Kojima likes to tell not show
[6:59:05] <%jiggy_snipe> different games with different pubs
[6:59:13] <Reizie_Etherealm> Kojima has the meats but no one brought the sides
[6:59:15] <eljuanito1989> Codec
[6:59:15] <happyface699> Hence the god awful “conversation” in this games ending
[6:59:20] <heartlesshealer> So glad Woolie got to the full journal selection
[6:59:24] <BurdRightsActivist> Did woolie finish the game already or something?
[6:59:26] <eljuanito1989> Codec don't Show
[6:59:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Higgs is a trauma kid, that got away from his dad and wanted to do good but got swept up with the world's harsh reality and didnt adapt
[6:59:29] <%jiggy_snipe> yes
[6:59:37] <VidulaSaix> Yup
[6:59:42] <peachy996> MGS4 has too much cutscene and not enough gameplay and phantom pain is the inverse
[6:59:46] <BurdRightsActivist> Why he still going, just wrapping up some works?
[6:59:51] <@Solidus_113> Higgs had a swing, listened to Sadness & Sorrow
[6:59:52] <%jiggy_snipe> yep
[6:59:54] <zenith0111> But Higgs lives!
[7:00:00] <VidulaSaix> Do do dooo
[7:00:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> does he?
[7:00:09] <+NotHereToStream> this game could of benefited from audio logs
[7:00:18] <eljuanito1989> Higgs Eh-Man
[7:00:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> pretty sure Higgs is left behind in the beach and either dies there
[7:00:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> or is shot by Fragile
[7:00:36] <arkv01> I'm glad higgs lives, it means we can get DLC
[7:00:40] <eljuanito1989> Troy Higgs-Man
[7:00:41] <happyface699> I love the Higgs fight
[7:00:41] <%jiggy_snipe> it's assumed he killed himself
[7:00:42] <+edibleskeleton> pretty tired of bad guys having sad childhoods because it's always going to have people defending them
[7:00:44] <zenith0111> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli What do you mean Fragile says what happens
[7:00:55] <eljuanito1989> Higgs Ocelot
[7:01:04] <VidulaSaix> There's impication he survives because where the fuck does that interview come from after the Beach
[7:01:04] <eljuanito1989> Liquid Higgs
[7:01:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh right she tells Sam that she makes Higgs pick
[7:01:06] <trulythedude> quick he says
[7:01:08] <VidulaSaix> implication*
[7:01:20] <VidulaSaix> They're pretty dense
[7:01:20] <zenith0111> "Implication" LUL
[7:01:20] <+NotHereToStream> I'm sure the doctor has an easy delivery
[7:01:26] <BurdRightsActivist> @VidulaSaix Time is convoluted
[7:01:30] <%Irridium> Didn't Fragile say she made him choose eternity on the beach or shooting himself? And we heard the gunshot...
[7:01:35] <%jiggy_snipe> he does have an interview when he's talking about being stranded on the beach
[7:01:38] <Nomad94> @VidulaSaix Nah, he shot himself
[7:01:42] <arkv01> 8 kilograms of meth
[7:01:52] <+NotHereToStream> bring shotgun, trust me
[7:02:06] <@Solidus_113> Look for the HG

[7:02:27] <blue2red> is it just death stranding today
[7:02:28] <zenith0111> @irridium So did he send the delivery for pizza before or during it ?
[7:02:28] <+razielhex> is that lake heart. or late booty?
[7:02:46] <Kalinflip> @razielhex Lake deez nuts
[7:02:47] <@Solidus_113> Heartman's heart-shaped heart lake
[7:02:57] <%Irridium> @zenith0111 I think that one's just set to happen should he not come back after a certain amount of time

[7:04:18] <+Taglog7> who got 5 on it?
[7:04:31] <BurdRightsActivist> Hey guys just a thought
[7:04:31] <Kalinflip> @Taglog7 i got ten atpRtsd4
[7:04:39] <zenith0111> If I don't see the character die on screen they aren't dead. That's what i believe at least
[7:04:41] <arkv01> I gotta say I thoroughly enjoyed all the reports more than everything else in the entire game
[7:04:47] <zenith0111> Works everytime
[7:05:09] <BurdRightsActivist> What if we had a character who's name was heartman, had heart attacks alot, had a big heart, and had like a heart condition which made his heart heart shaped? Maybe the people will get the message, but I'm not too sure
[7:05:28] <BurdRightsActivist> Maybe he should live on a heart shaped lake too? Just a thought
[7:05:31] <Kalinflip> @BurdRightsActivist To abstract

[7:34:27] <Kalinflip> aww she poppin percs to ease da hut
[7:34:30] <Kalinflip> hurt*
[7:34:39] <GarbageNirvana> disapPOINTED
[7:34:39] <%Firgof> 1st report was a report about how the therapist was the cause of the voidout
[7:34:40] <floralkami> So this is why Sam won't DARE let anyone else get close to him again.
[7:34:43] <arkv01> me too reg i'm shakin
[7:34:44] <%Firgof> This one is her actual sign-off
[7:34:48] <Tuna_Can_0> D:
[7:34:52] <Nomad94> D:
[7:34:52] <%jiggy_snipe> @Superbro64 it's a report after she died and this report is right before she dies
[7:34:54] <+CptBritches> :(
[7:34:56] <+tearfuldevil> sweet jebus
[7:34:56] <arkv01> oh god no Biblethump
[7:34:56] <%Grayhammatter> D:
[7:34:56] <%Superbro64> @firgof ah, gotcha
[7:34:56] <Kalinflip> I love u to lucy goosey atpFeelsBeardMan
[7:34:57] <+NotHereToStream> then boom
[7:34:58] <VidulaSaix> You can't see it since he's reading it @WoolieVersus but "Bridget and Amelie" in the report are said in a way that it seems like she knows Bridget and Amelie are the same person
[7:34:59] <arkv01> BibleThump
[7:35:00] <Djinnazz> Well then...
[7:35:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> She just lost her mind
[7:35:00] <+JohnMcClane6194> NotLikeThis
[7:35:02] <Tuna_Can_0> FeelsBadMan
[7:35:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FeelsBadMan
[7:35:04] <zenith0111> BibleThump
[7:35:06] <alrobot2014> did she commit suicide as a result of going insane from DOOMS?
[7:35:06] <Kalinflip> the bibble atpRtsd
[7:35:11] <Kalinflip> @alrobot2014 yea
[7:35:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> she couldnt handle what Amelie sees
[7:35:12] <samuraijakanddaxter> so why exactly did she do it
[7:35:13] <%Monkeyweed21> bitch couldn't handle the DOOMS cum
[7:35:14] <vVAstrAVv> too much insight
[7:35:15] <BurdRightsActivist> TBH I'd lose my shit too if I learned all that shit at once
[7:35:15] <VidulaSaix> She klilled herself yeah
[7:35:16] <%Firgof> Woolie's Church of the Universal Truth claims another soul!
[7:35:17] <arkv01> are these reports only available post game?
[7:35:19] <+tearfuldevil> but wuh happen
[7:35:20] <Nomad94> @WoolieVersus I think that might explain how his phobia returned, huh.
[7:35:20] <BallerSwagBro9k> @alrobot2014 Basically yes
[7:35:23] <BurdRightsActivist> !FRENZY!
[7:35:29] <%Superbro64> ! frenzy ! essentially then
[7:35:31] <redrins> mind at risk
[7:35:31] <KnivesEve> amile made her crazy
[7:35:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> thats exactly why Amelie wanted to end shit
[7:35:33] <Kalinflip> I live life like that all the time
[7:35:37] <%Monkeyweed21> She couldn't handle the truth
[7:35:37] <BallerSwagBro9k> She lost her mind @woolieversus
[7:35:38] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus DOOMs causes suicide
[7:35:39] <+CptBritches> She couldn't handle it
[7:35:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Too much Insight
[7:35:45] <VidulaSaix> The implication is that Amelie and Bridget basically railroaded them into being together
[7:35:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because while she is EE, shes also a human
[7:35:47] <Picosunloaded> @WoolieVersus she couldn't handle the truth
[7:35:47] <+agumon9000> or Chiral Contamination
[7:35:47] <Asuxley> Sam's cum is a portal for Cuthulu
[7:35:47] <+CptBritches> That would destroy some people
[7:35:49] <$MateoPeso> Didn't want to bring a child into the world
[7:35:49] <%jiggy_snipe> DOOMs causes suicidal thoughts
[7:35:50] <+PleasantLeech> because the baby kept pulling her into the beach
[7:35:51] <VidulaSaix> At least thats how I took it
[7:35:52] <samuraijakanddaxter> amelie killed her
[7:35:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> Its like with Eldritch beings
[7:35:52] <Nomad94> Universal truth was too much
[7:35:53] <JaseAdrift> BIG INSIGHT
[7:35:54] <ALTRNico> cant handle the universal truth
[7:36:00] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @jorniev
[7:36:00] <+D00msDayDan> this is what comes of your universal truth, woolie
[7:36:02] <Nomad94> @ALTRNico MVGame
[7:36:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THATS THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH,WOOLIE
[7:36:05] <zenith0111> SHE DIED FROM INSIGHT
[7:36:09] <Kalinflip> slewasice
[7:36:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> thats what happens!
[7:36:15] <VidulaSaix> Too many eyes on the inside
[7:36:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Universal Truth killed her
[7:36:16] <%jiggy_snipe> this is what the Universal Truth brings Woolie Kappa
[7:36:17] <zenith0111> SHE GOT BLOODBORNED
[7:36:18] <peachy996> Her entire worldview just massively changed
[7:36:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> INSIGHT OVERDOSE
[7:36:22] <BurdRightsActivist> Universal TRUTH
[7:36:23] <ALTRNico> pat was right ya know?
[7:36:25] <Tuna_Can_0> sometime it really do be like that
[7:36:27] <%Exiliator> Universal truth overdose
[7:36:28] <alrobot2014> it was mentioned that dooms gives people the extinction entity's nightmares
[7:36:31] <arkv01> holy shit I just noticed but does Sam have dual BBs now?
[7:36:32] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus "While DOOMS sufferers are more resistant to chiralium exposure than normal humans, they are not immune, and higher levels of DOOMS may precipitate the erratic, suicidal, or homicidal tendencies of the Homo Demens."
[7:36:35] <+CptBritches> She wasn't in her right mind after that. She fell apart
[7:36:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Having a baby when you KNOW the world is fucked is a BAD combination
[7:36:43] <%Firgof> @arkv01 Nah, he's not a Voltron
[7:36:43] <+D00msDayDan> not everyone is as strong-willed as you, woolie, sometimes the universal truth is too much to handle
[7:36:44] <BurdRightsActivist> Tbh though that's pretty fucked.
[7:36:49] <BallerSwagBro9k> This is the price....of UNIVERSAL TRUTH
[7:36:50] <%Firgof> Those are heating pads
[7:37:04] <Kalinflip> demans
[7:37:09] <%Firgof> Reduces the amount of stamina damage you take in snowy/cold areas
[7:37:11] <+Vikingdeath1> I thought it was Sam's magic blood baby inside her giving her Chiral contamination
[7:37:12] <praisedasun_> cause the world was going to end for real
[7:37:15] <%jiggy_snipe> @chesterr01 I believe she also figured out what was up with "Bridget and Amelie"
[7:37:22] <%Irridium> last order was for heartman I think @WoolieVersus
[7:37:24] <Kalinflip> @praisedasun_ and did atpRtsd
[7:37:36] <samuraijakanddaxter> she was born pre stranding and pre beaches too she said
[7:37:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Still want that Universal Truth @WoolieVersus
[7:37:51] <Kalinflip> @samuraijakanddaxter Before she knew they were things
[7:37:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[7:37:52] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus In one of the earlier ones she makes mention of Bridget being oddly happy at them becoming a couple, so I think it's implied that on top of all the crazy shit she learned was real she also learned that Bridget basically railroaded them into being together and having a child which caused her to have these crazy visions, the same kind that eventually drove Amelie mad as well. That's my interpretation.
[7:37:52] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @VidulaSaix
[7:37:58] <VidulaSaix> Dammit moobot LUL
[7:38:04] <@Solidus_113> nice
[7:38:05] <+MajorCrasher> DOOMS makes a lot of people suicidal if it's not treated.
[7:38:08] <%Firgof> moobot sees your post. moobot don't care.
[7:38:17] <Rayorin> doomers
[7:38:20] <zenith0111> She knew more than most of the main cast
[7:38:22] <ne0bunny> she didnt grow up with dooms like sam and co, so she didnt grow up with the nightmares. experiencing them suddenly as an adult was too much for her I guess
[7:38:24] <%Irridium> this *should* do it. God willing.
[7:38:35] <+D00msDayDan> @Monkeyweed21 he'll walk it back saying DOOMS is why she killed herself and not the Universal Truth
[7:38:36] <VidulaSaix> In one of the earlier ones she makes mention of Bridget being oddly happy at them becoming a couple, so I think it's implied that on top of all the crazy shit she learned was real she also learned that Bridget
[7:38:38] <%Firgof> Amelie Provides
[7:38:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> Fuck u Moobot
[7:38:49] <zenith0111> Woolie do a premium delivery NotLikeThis
[7:38:52] <VidulaSaix> basically railroaded them into being together and having a child which caused her to have these crazy visions, the same kind that eventually drove Amelie mad as well. That's my interpretation.
[7:39:10] <%Monkeyweed21> DOOMS gives you nightmares of the truth and most people cant deal with it
[7:39:17] <$MateoPeso> Makes sense why he would want to "adopt" BB and not have a kid of his own
[7:39:30] <+NotHereToStream> shits fucked
[7:39:34] <+MajorCrasher> well Amelie causes the nightmares, they didn't drive her insane. the burden of being an EE did
[7:39:45] <kulmoth> Woolies church of universal truth everybody
[7:39:45] <zenith0111> @vidulasaix Amelie and Bridget are the same person
[7:39:50] <VidulaSaix> I'm aware
[7:40:16] <VidulaSaix> If this doesn't also 5 star Jebaited
[7:40:20] <%Exiliator> Her "rational mind" could maybe not handle the "irrational world"?
[7:40:26] <vVAstrAVv> im not sure milie really went mad. it just seemed like her gency asan ee is quite restricted
[7:40:27] <VidulaSaix> Also don't forgot those 5 new interviews yu unlocked @WoolieVersus
[7:40:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Imminent extinction is hard to deal with as a new mom
[7:40:37] <+Proxzo> Her proximity to Sam exposed her, a normal person to Dooms constantly. I think bridget being around all the time didn't help either
[7:40:37] <%Irridium> if this doesn't 5 star wait for heartman to die again and shit on his floor
[7:40:43] <peachy996> "I'm glad Sam saved our world but...I'm gonna make that bitch work for his 5 stars"
[7:40:44] <SethAm_> Is that detail known at this point or are spoilers out in the open rn?
[7:40:44] <+NotHereToStream> swear to god heartman
[7:40:51] <Pappajimbo> here is a theory the voidout wasnt her bridget teleported a corpse and took lucy to be a still mother and lou is LOU made into a BB
[7:40:58] <vVAstrAVv> they beat the game man lol
[7:41:01] <Nomad94> @Pappajimbo Sounds stupid

[7:47:03] <+NotHereToStream> bridget is a cunt
[7:47:06] <+MajorCrasher> yeah Bridget is pretty terrible
[7:47:08] <Camail> patricia is a biiiiiiitch
[7:47:08] <%Monkeyweed21> SAM'S MOM SUCKS
[7:47:08] <Nomad94> Bridget was literally soulless
[7:47:11] <%Prevot> President Bitchet
[7:47:25] <Tuna_Can_0> huh this die-hardman looks familiar but he's wearing a mask so who knows?
[7:47:29] <jorniev> wait but how does he show up with her later!?
[7:47:32] <peachy996> "I loved her" and yet
[7:47:32] <+drfaustisdead> The ends literally justified the means though.
[7:47:33] <%jiggy_snipe> PieceoShit Lady
[7:47:33] <+agumon9000> Bridget was literally SOULLESS LUL
[7:47:37] <VidulaSaix> John FeelsBadMan
[7:47:41] <+drfaustisdead> it's not moral but it's the truth.
[7:47:42] <peachy996> The feeling was not returned
[7:47:46] <ALTRNico> Poor Dudeman?
[7:47:46] <+D00msDayDan> what are you talking about woolie she still has human feelings and emotions
[7:47:47] <$MateoPeso> But she isn't Amelie, right? I mean they're the same person but already split
[7:47:48] <Slimeking_Mike> Poor Dudeman
[7:47:55] <+agumon9000> Kojumbo did it again! Bridget is the evil one because she is literally soulless.
[7:47:56] <vVAstrAVv> give this man a game of his own lol
[7:47:59] <+MajorCrasher> guys die hard man didn't wear the mask until after his death was faked
[7:48:01] <zenith0111> @drfaustisdead Not even close to what they were going for LUL
[7:48:04] <+D00msDayDan> bridget is still human underneath the EE part which is why she tried to stop the last stranding
[7:48:22] <+Willdog1993> No "Get Into Fighting Games" tonight?
[7:48:25] <jasnake> O.k. I just killed this war Hero and shot a baby, I'm going to say you did it, wear this mask, you're Die-Hard-Man now.
[7:48:26] <peachy996> She's still a beach though
[7:48:29] <VidulaSaix> Prolly not lol
[7:48:40] <%Firgof> 'Also keep being my advisor or I out you and you die'
[7:48:52] <+MajorCrasher> yeah pretty much
[7:49:02] <VidulaSaix> Fucking ridiculous LUL
[7:49:05] <peachy996> Just because you want humanity to survive doesn't mean you care about any of the humans in it save Sam
[7:49:05] <%Firgof> 'Nothing more reliable at getting people to want to kill you than if I tell them you shoot babies against direct orders'
[7:49:17] <peachy996> Which explains Amelie entire plot in the game
[7:49:19] <+drfaustisdead> Compromising information.
[7:49:33] <$MateoPeso> EPSTIEN
[7:49:38] <%jiggy_snipe> it's hard to trust the official story
[7:49:48] <%Monkeyweed21> MCLANE KILLED EPSTIEN
[7:49:54] <%Prevot> president strand choked Epstein herself
[7:50:02] <+MajorCrasher> John is the real hero
[7:50:05] <%DatAsuna> Also cliff invented an engine that ran on water and the exhaust was monster energy
[7:50:12] <%jiggy_snipe> President Strand hired Gill to end Epstein
[7:50:15] <zenith0111> Remember Kojima predicted 9/11
[7:50:17] <+NotHereToStream> strand fed epstein to the bt
[7:50:25] <alrobot2014> the boss was done dirty
[7:50:29] <peachy996> Epstein killed himself, Trump did nothing wrong and Hillary earned that 2016 DNC Candidacy
[7:50:30] <samuraijakanddaxter> Bridget was totally hillary Clinton
[7:50:35] <%Firgof> I'm not saying that Death knows that the tar pits make an excellent place to dispose of bodies but...
[7:50:36] <+Master_Quincey> i'm looking for snake eater on vinyl
[7:50:39] <peachy996> There are no conspiracies
[7:50:44] <arkv01> ahhh its not that bad
[7:50:48] <arkv01> MGSV could've been worse
[7:50:50] <peachy996> Now who wants some Kool Aid
[7:50:51] <$MateoPeso> Such a good fucking ending
[7:50:55] <+MajorCrasher> dude I cried the first time I finished mgs3
[7:51:03] <+Master_Quincey> MGSV is the best unfinished game of all time
[7:51:05] <+BionoidLCR> @arkv01 mgs5 was worse
[7:51:05] <VidulaSaix> Diamond Bridges
[7:51:11] <+MajorCrasher> I was so sad about the boss
[7:51:17] <%Firgof> Puppet Figurehead 100%
[7:51:28] <jorniev> DIE HARDMAN ATE SHIT ON PURPOSE
[7:51:33] <Nomad94> She gave that mask to John
[7:51:38] <%Prevot> she's just evil
[7:51:43] <alexandrecau> mask of authority
[7:51:43] <%Monkeyweed21> It's the evil bitch mask
[7:51:44] <LaughingCatt> Gotta hide the cancer
[7:51:45] <Nomad94> Why she wore it though?
[7:51:45] <KnivesEve> subtext
[7:51:46] <VidulaSaix> It looks cool to Kojima
[7:51:48] <VidulaSaix> Shut up
[7:51:50] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[7:51:51] <+CptBritches> Supertext
[7:51:52] <Nomad94> because symbolism
[7:51:53] <iosephe> Top secret experiments
[7:51:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[7:51:54] <%Firgof> Because she's death and wants to look cool as death does
[7:51:54] <alexandrecau> it's like a crown
[7:51:54] <heartlesshealer> SYMBOLISM
[7:51:54] <+Master_Quincey> for the edge Kappa
[7:51:55] <%jiggy_snipe> it's the director's mask for Bridges maybe?
[7:51:58] <arkv01> whoeevr wears the mask gets to be an arrancar I guess?
[7:51:58] <jasnake> It's cool though
[7:51:58] <ThDark> Maybe the Director of Bridges wore a mask?
[7:52:00] <+CptBritches> Here, I brought you a metaphor
[7:52:00] <+NotHereToStream> its a metaphor Kappa
[7:52:01] <MillaMoks> @WoolieVersus So that when people saw Amelie they would not know they looked Identical
[7:52:02] <GarbageNirvana> No one cared who she was until she put on the mask
[7:52:02] <peachy996> It's a really cool mask Woolie
[7:52:03] <+D00msDayDan> you gotta deliver the box of tengas to kojima to unlock the interview about the mask
[7:52:03] <Asuxley> she liked the mask aesthetics?
[7:52:09] <+MajorCrasher> subtext
[7:52:11] <vVAstrAVv> didn't wanna be known as baby killer. still wore a freaky death mask
[7:52:16] <eldragon_1> Because she's DEATH
[7:52:17] <ElkRiverDog> Mask of Death?
[7:52:19] <%Firgof> It's OK she gave John her Physical mask and put on a Metaphor.
[7:52:19] <%Monkeyweed21> she thought it was cool
[7:52:21] <peachy996> Oh I think she wears the mask because of age things
[7:52:24] <+luftraumm1> there's the whole conversation about being a blank slate
[7:52:27] <+drfaustisdead> @WoolieVersus I think she was wearing it to hide her identity because the previous president outlawed the BB experiments.
[7:52:28] <peachy996> I remember reading that bit
[7:52:45] <+CptBritches> Gotta start somewhere
[7:52:46] <VidulaSaix> I think the most important question now that we're at the end; Did the game live up to your expectations even though it's not what you were expecting?
[7:52:48] <arkv01> yo yeah eveyrone has an EE, like G Gundam
[7:52:50] <%Firgof> I want to see Canadian EE
[7:52:50] <%Prevot> all the countries in the world belong to AMERICA
[7:52:54] <arkv01> lumberjack EE
[7:52:55] <%Firgof> "Sorry"
[7:53:05] <Axle13j> Lmaooo
[7:53:06] <samuraijakanddaxter> and wasn't it suspicious that a guy called John mcclane went missing then a guy called die hardman came around?
[7:53:06] <+MajorCrasher> idk, did the dinosaurs get a representative for every region?
[7:53:07] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[7:53:07] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[7:53:07] <heartlesshealer> it just materialized in the US and that's it
[7:53:10] <+NotHereToStream> LUL
[7:53:10] <$MateoPeso> EE just happened to be American I guess
[7:53:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[7:53:11] <+luftraumm1> America is a stand in for the world
[7:53:11] <Ropcord> Kojima is a westaboo, sorry everyone else LUL
[7:53:11] <+lethallunacyx> yeah do they go into that at all?
[7:53:14] <%jiggy_snipe> the rest of the world is fine
[7:53:14] <i_heart_gaming> @WoolieVersus Did the game exceed your expectations?
[7:53:16] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[7:53:19] <alexandrecau> Germany got EE'D to death
[7:53:23] <jorniev> @drfaustisdead the only thing you should question is why does it look so cool
[7:53:28] <arkv01> ANIME's STILL ALIVE IN JAPAN, america's gotta deal with this apocalypse shit
[7:53:29] <+luftraumm1> the game works on allegory rules
[7:53:30] <%Firgof> America Stranding
[7:53:30] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus in one of the other missing interviews, you can read that Heartman moves on from beach searching and finds a new wife, named Samantha Spade. He still lives in 20 minute intervals however.
[7:53:37] <+lethallunacyx> is the rest of the world just fine?
[7:53:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> world: what happened to America? ehh who cares
[7:53:39] <peachy996> I had no expectations set for Death Stranding and came away liking it. Mostly because it was its own standalone thing
[7:53:46] <+vectorless_peon> She was wairing it to be anon in this blacksite experiment, remember when Cliff was talking about being lied to by a woman in a mask implying her anonimity
[7:53:47] <peachy996> Not like Silent Hills or Phantom Pain
[7:53:51] <%jinking79> America Death Beach
[7:53:51] <+CptBritches> He clearly wanted to focus on America specifically, the game can't go to every country on the planet
[7:53:53] <VidulaSaix> Its over PogChamp
[7:53:55] <%LordSDB> Isn't that every Jrpg tho @woolieversus. end of the world only at japan

[7:57:56] <OldManDeckardCain> delaying granblue is only fitting considering the western release LUL

[7:59:13] <zenith0111> WAR HELL
[7:59:15] <Cykron> Let’s burn this baby and go home
[7:59:17] <%SouLucha> Yeah, forget BranGlue. Kappa
[7:59:18] <jorniev> CLIFF
[7:59:30] <worldbrand> the maddest mikkelsen
[7:59:33] <%jiggy_snipe> Bridget killed him and his son
[7:59:34] <zenith0111> BibleThump
[7:59:42] <alrobot2014> while being shot by the hand of his BEST FRIEND
[7:59:44] <+NotHereToStream> Dads Mikkelsen is nothing to be fucked with
[7:59:44] <VidulaSaix> Not even a little
[7:59:45] <%Firgof> Not forgetting that they only wanted his son to be a tool in a machine to bring about the end of the world
[7:59:46] <jorniev> PUNISHED MADDS
[7:59:47] <+D00msDayDan> woolie: i don't want my cult to do anything bad. also woolie: cliff should burn UCA to the ground
[7:59:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Maddest Mikkelsen is real strong
[7:59:58] <%Prevot> bitch literally stole his son
[8:00:00] <arkv01> good daddy
[8:00:05] <+luftraumm1> he's the best
[8:00:16] <jorniev> GIVE ME MBACK MY SON
[8:00:23] <Cykron> DOOM SLAYER VS MADDS
[8:00:27] <samuraijakanddaxter> he'll keep coming
[8:00:28] <ElenaManetta> eat 100 babies to save the earth before midnight
[8:00:30] <peachy996> Die Hardwoman
[8:00:31] <+luftraumm1> he's also pretty much snake
[8:00:40] <GarbageNirvana> He's not a Papa Bear, he's Ursa Fucking Major
[8:00:45] <+luftraumm1> woolieLORE
[8:00:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> I would've loved to see him take out some dudes before going down but those military officers are just following orders
[8:00:57] <ALTRNico> love it
[8:00:59] <vVAstrAVv> not JUST death. extinction. MASS DEATH
[8:01:11] <Madbearv> because they keep bringing him back from being dead
[8:01:14] <peachy996> m'lady
[8:01:14] <imthewisejanitor> I've still gotta catch up on the last couple videos I've missed, but catching the tail end of this live has been a blast. Keep on keepin' on, y'all.
[8:01:21] <Axle13j> Fuck death(?)
[8:01:22] <Madbearv> all Thanos wants is to die in peace
[8:01:27] <Cykron> Yeah I don’t fault the security guys for doing their jobs, but Bridget is fucking EVIL
[8:01:47] <%jinking79> Death and Thanos have a child
[8:01:48] <peachy996> No she shot her work and felt bad
[8:02:00] <%Firgof> So anguished she ramped up the extinction schedule by bringing it back to life
[8:02:02] <VidulaSaix> I know they're the same person, but I still think that Amelie is somewhat redeemable
[8:02:05] <VidulaSaix> Bridget is the horrible one
[8:02:06] <peachy996> Guilt raising came after
[8:02:09] <vVAstrAVv> if your job is jobbing for evil no fuck you too
[8:02:16] <worldbrand> +
[8:02:16] <+Taglog7> BlessRNG
[8:02:20] <zenith0111> @vidulasaix Two sides of the same coin
[8:02:20] <+NotHereToStream> Bridget..is the definition of necessary evil..I think?
[8:02:27] <+CptBritches> And cross the Cliff with the Bridges
[8:02:33] <Kalinflip> Its the injury from when he was a baby and got shot
[8:02:35] <%tattleworm> and what structure helps you cross over water
[8:02:38] <heartlesshealer> What is a subtlety
[8:02:39] <Reizie_Etherealm> Sam Porter Cross?
[8:02:41] <+D00msDayDan> woolie is also vastly overestimating how much control bridget/amelie has over being an EE and causing the last stranding
[8:02:45] <+CptBritches> Tommie Earl Jenkins killed it acting wise
[8:02:45] <peachy996> Of the Entity Bridget was the more amoral of the two
[8:02:48] <+MajorCrasher> OMG @startstoprepeat
[8:02:51] <VidulaSaix> Why?
[8:02:52] <$MateoPeso> We all thought it was a C section
[8:02:52] <%jiggy_snipe> no
[8:02:53] <worldbrand> wh... why?
[8:02:53] <arkv01> uh no?
[8:02:54] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[8:02:54] <+BionoidLCR> why would he?
[8:02:55] <+therabbles> hell no
[8:02:55] <+Taglog7> You could say a cross is 2 strands Kappa
[8:02:56] <+CptBritches> LMAO
[8:02:56] <Cykron> Yeah but Bridges was trying to save humanity and shit
[8:02:58] <%SouLucha> LUL
[8:02:58] <Zayasu> why? LUL
[8:02:59] <+glactic> I'm not sure what I clicked on? I thought he was streaming Death Stranding?
[8:02:59] <Djinnazz> #CliffDidNothingWrong
[8:03:00] <jorniev> no
[8:03:00] <alrobot2014> heeelllllllll nnooooooooo
[8:03:03] <%jiggy_snipe> naw
[8:03:06] <jorniev> YOU ARE CRAZY
[8:03:08] <arkv01> woolie isn't a fucking crazy ginger goblin
[8:03:11] <+GalacticaPhanto> Wait am I just catching the end of the stream?
[8:03:13] <Axle13j> Ffffffuck no lol
[8:03:14] <Picosunloaded> but the mods woolz the mods
[8:03:14] <+NotHereToStream> NAH, unless I see a mod for normans weenus
[8:03:16] <jorniev> I WILL PLAY IT
[8:03:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> Not just a naw but HELL NAWW
[8:03:18] <VidulaSaix> Woolie aint never launching this game again
[8:03:19] <+BionoidLCR> nova you must be buggin
[8:03:19] <$MateoPeso> But what if they have JoJo mods
[8:03:20] <VidulaSaix> he's done LUL
[8:03:20] <+Flambage> Death Stranding Lp 2 Electric Boogaloo
[8:03:21] <+MajorCrasher> @glactic he just finished it
[8:03:23] <%jiggy_snipe> 200+ hours on ps4
[8:03:25] <imthewisejanitor> PC release is also rumored to coincide with possible DLC. We'll see.
[8:03:33] <heartlesshealer> It just eats too much time for someone in Woolie's livelihood
[8:03:34] <zenith0111> "PC Master Race" atpRtsd
[8:03:35] <+luftraumm1> this is a game you end
[8:03:37] <+MajorCrasher> but what if they add dlc?
[8:03:37] <+therabbles> 200 hours
[8:03:38] <arkv01> 200 hours
[8:03:38] <GarbageNirvana> Already taking the disc back to gamestop
[8:03:40] <+glactic> Ah, okay
[8:03:42] <ALTRNico> you didnt 5 star mama tho
[8:03:43] <peachy996> This is a one-time meal of a game
[8:03:46] <%tattleworm> you gotta do it on hard mode to get them legend of legend ranks tho
[8:03:49] <+NotHereToStream> You glad you played it?
[8:03:49] <+cvp5127> new hats tho
[8:03:52] <Cykron> This game is ONE SINGLE EXPERIENCE
[8:03:52] <jorniev> DLC?
[8:03:53] <arkv01> higgs DLC mb
[8:03:53] <+luftraumm1> a long ass meal
[8:03:53] <worldbrand> if there are any insane mods i'll just youtube them lol
[8:03:54] <vVAstrAVv> like 207 hours by now lol
[8:03:56] <ElenaManetta> i can't tell if woolie enjoyed the experience but got burnt out or if it just became a slog and he trudged through it annoyed
[8:03:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's a closed book
[8:04:05] <+GalacticaPhanto> kojima makes a psychological pizza making game
[8:04:14] <damascussteele> do a speed run
[8:04:21] <Cykron> That’s enough Kojumbo for now
[8:04:23] <vVAstrAVv> he 100% it. pretty sure he loved it
[8:04:30] <Kalinflip> @luftraumm1 Absolutely
[8:04:30] <%jinking79> still that Stinger Ending left
[8:04:31] <VidulaSaix> Genius Kojumbo
[8:04:33] <+Flambage> But what if you can mod in Norman Reedus from Ride into the game? @WoolieVersus
[8:04:34] <eldragon_1> Unless they turn the Higgs fight into a full fighting game
[8:04:36] <+drfaustisdead> I don't
[8:04:36] <heartlesshealer> EVERYONE
[8:04:38] <imthewisejanitor> I read a rumor regarding DLC potentially including another area and new weapons, but I really can't back that up for certain.
[8:04:38] <+BionoidLCR> FUCK HER SHES AN ASSHOLE
[8:04:39] <%jiggy_snipe> YEP
[8:04:41] <$MateoPeso> For the most part
[8:04:42] <VidulaSaix> I dont hate Amelia, I hate Bridget
[8:04:42] <Madbearv> yea
[8:04:43] <DrUnconscious> nah
[8:04:44] <%KingOfTheGeats> I'm on the Fuck Amelie train
[8:04:44] <maguado87> did they finish?
[8:04:45] <+agumon9000> No
[8:04:45] <+drfaustisdead> She's a tragic figure.
[8:04:48] <+NotHereToStream> Everyone, but I understand what she is doing
[8:04:49] <Kalinflip> She was doing what she thought was right
[8:04:50] <%Irridium> bro I did not hesitate to pull the trigger on that bitch
[8:04:51] <vVAstrAVv> princess BEOTCH
[8:04:51] <%jiggy_snipe> they're the same person
[8:04:53] <shaggycactus> worst character in the game
[8:04:56] <zenith0111> THANKS ONE GUY
[8:04:56] <worldbrand> I can't really blame her given it's next to impossible to empathize with her position, but i definitely don't like her
[8:04:57] <+luftraumm1> what the hell does a speedrun of this game even look like
[8:04:59] <Cykron> Yeah she sucks
[8:05:05] <ALTRNico> the ramblings are annoying
[8:05:06] <+NotHereToStream> She did horrible stuff attempting to save humanity, but then she said fuck it, end it all
[8:05:08] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus LIKE MARIO AND PRINCESS BEACH
[8:05:12] <$MateoPeso> Sooo, best villian?
[8:05:12] <peachy996> I hate Amelie/Bridget but you gave better context to her so I don't hate her as much
[8:05:14] <Cykron> They are both evil and horrible
[8:05:14] <Camail> she is a terrorist
[8:05:14] <%Firgof> @woolieversus It's literally Sympathy for the Devil. Says more about Sam than it does about Death.
[8:05:15] <Reizie_Etherealm> I hate what she does, but I don't hate her does that make any sense?
[8:05:20] <peachy996> She's still a shit tho
[8:05:21] <Madbearv> Hey Woolie when's Xenogears
[8:05:23] <OldManDeckardCain> reggie you can't forgive her just because you think she's hot LUL
[8:05:23] <%tattleworm> you can read into it that amelie purposefully made sam's wife commit suicide imo
[8:05:27] <+MajorCrasher> Bridget is the devil, Amelie is a sympathetic villain. they're technically the same person but different facets of her personality
[8:05:28] <Kalinflip> I mean in the grand scale of things she did nothing wrong
[8:05:30] <Cykron> She’s bad in multiple ways
[8:05:30] <Kalinflip> :)
[8:05:39] <+drfaustisdead> She has zero agency in the end of humanity.
[8:05:43] <Kalinflip> she did what she was created to do
[8:05:48] <vVAstrAVv> ok but woolie. amelie or sakura
[8:05:48] <+luftraumm1> ain't nothing you can point to and call evil in this game
[8:05:50] <+NotHereToStream> She tried to prevent it, and she did HORRIBLE stuff in a pursuit of that
[8:05:55] <+eanscrale> Yeah, but if you're the frog
[8:05:56] <Camail> she gives higgs powers to kill people
[8:05:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[8:05:57] <Kalinflip> @luftraumm1 Facts
[8:05:59] <$MateoPeso> Blame the world for dying
[8:06:01] <%Firgof> She was the One Ring trying to be Good.
[8:06:02] <peachy996> Oh yeah like that scene in NBK
[8:06:06] <zenith0111> @vidulasaix The fact you even make a distinction like that is super weird. It's semantics really.
[8:06:07] <GarbageNirvana> It's different if no one knew she was a scorpion
[8:06:12] <+luftraumm1> nature is cruel sure, but evil, nope
[8:06:15] <Cykron> She’s doing her universe ordained job
[8:06:15] <Kalinflip> Kojima is pretty good
[8:06:15] <VidulaSaix> That's why I can somewhat get Amelia, but Bridget specifically did malicious thing just to eb abitch. Things that had no relation to being an EE
[8:06:15] <peachy996> "I'm a snake bitch, what did you think would happen"
[8:06:16] <worldbrand> i'll fite u
[8:06:18] <%jinking79> least she not Urizen
[8:06:20] <arkv01> man who sold the world
[8:06:27] <Kalinflip> ^^
[8:06:59] <Kalinflip> maybe to her it isnt
[8:07:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> She's atoning for god knows how many years on the beach abyss for the rest of her existence simply waiting for the end
[8:07:02] <zenith0111> KEEP HYPERVENTILATING
[8:07:06] <zenith0111> -Ross
[8:07:11] <Virokwet> yeyeye
[8:07:11] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Btw. Woolie you should know. During that hug Amilie bit, Pat failed 8+ times and instantly tried shooting her.
[8:07:12] <+luftraumm1> that poem is great but has been sort of tainted
[8:07:13] <heartlesshealer> She saw humanity as 9S
[8:07:14] <+D00msDayDan> it's not her conviction, it's her nature to bring about the last stranding, her free will let her set this grand plan in motion with sam and the chiral network that created this situation where humanity can live on
[8:07:16] <+NotHereToStream> shes gonna stay in that beach forever
[8:07:18] <peachy996> If Bridget is the Ha does that mean her self is gone once she dies or does she combine back into the EE
[8:07:19] <Madbearv> She set the stranding off early
[8:07:23] <peachy996> Like Deadman
[8:07:24] <Madbearv> Like way way early
[8:07:29] <Reizie_Etherealm> She tried to
[8:07:32] <+NotHereToStream> oh boy next week podcast
[8:07:37] <sennoh> she flip flopped all game, and then forced Sam to make the decision for her
[8:07:37] <Cykron> Struggle till the end in your piss and shit
[8:07:37] <+drfaustisdead> I'm literally working on a video talking about her as we speak.
[8:07:39] <Kalinflip> @agumon9000 I did too but i didnt get the cutscene I pressed the wrong button trying to pistol whip her and hugged her by mistake
[8:07:41] <VidulaSaix> Spoilercast is gonna be some shit for sure
[8:07:43] <VidulaSaix> I cant wait
[8:07:43] <%jiggy_snipe> her actions set off the death stranding
[8:07:45] <Kalinflip> atpRtsd
[8:07:45] <Madbearv> She made choices
[8:07:46] <arkv01> lyin hoes
[8:07:53] <+agumon9000> LUL
[8:07:58] <zenith0111> Based Woolie
[8:08:00] <%Firgof> Probably increasing Humanity over time
[8:08:02] <%Prevot> NotLikeThis
[8:08:04] <+luftraumm1> not even that
[8:08:04] <+SassyBassy_> Just came in what are they talking about
[8:08:05] <Kalinflip> @jiggy_snipe I mean the extinction would happen anyway
[8:08:06] <VidulaSaix> What doomsday said is a pretty good way to put it
[8:08:11] <+agumon9000> Also. The title of the next podcast needs to be. "S Rank your baby to save humanity."
[8:08:14] <arkv01> its purely the human part that lies
[8:08:19] <peachy996> I think I'd hate her more if Sam cared about her more after all that
[8:08:24] <ALTRNico> is Woolie telling the universal truth again?
[8:08:25] <+Pharmakokinetic> doesn't Bridget/Amelie cause the Death Stranding by bringing back Sam from the dead using the beach to begin with? hubris causes the literal end of everything
[8:08:27] <%jiggy_snipe> @Kalinflip yea but she sped it up alot
[8:08:29] <Cykron> Bridget ain’t shit but hoes and tricks
[8:08:43] <+luftraumm1> once must imagine Sysyphus happy as Camus would say
[8:08:45] <peachy996> But having him say Fuck Bridges and stick with Louise is a great save
[8:08:49] <spacecatstreams> wuli
[8:08:49] <Kalinflip> @jiggy_snipe Right in her mind she was doin a service to the world
[8:08:55] <+NotHereToStream> GG
[8:08:55] <zenith0111> Bridget is basically the Stand of Amelie LUL
