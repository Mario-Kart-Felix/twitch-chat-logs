[0:00:20] <Jewoodsforreal> @prevot I will!
[0:00:22] <youngking_kush> YO
[0:00:30] <%Indigo_Automaton> Salutations!
[0:00:32] <velgaduere> WHAT A POD
[0:00:33] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:00:34] <velgaduere> GOOD POD
[0:00:36] <leith_aziz> Didnt see the podcast
[0:00:38] <anachronologist> Woolie is the Virgil to Reggie's Dante, I am speaking of the divine comedy, but take it as you will
[0:00:39] <+cubbywolf> gotta download that
[0:00:39] <%Solidnick18> yep
[0:00:41] <leith_aziz> Cool
[0:00:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> GARFLORD

[0:01:03] <%holydeviant1> Did a hot demon call you a fuckboy yet
[0:01:04] <OldManDeckardCain> it totally won't come to pc btw Kappa
[0:01:11] <+anoldtoilet> SMT4 wasnt that great imo. SMT4a was AWESOME
[0:01:14] <leith_aziz> I've felt like the game got kinda cucked, but I've never even played a mainline SMT game
[0:01:17] <%Solidnick18> i beat the first big boss monster.
[0:01:18] <RickyRelucent> h y p e
[0:01:27] <Arqartur0> is SMT good? Never seen it.
[0:01:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:01:27] <leith_aziz> @anoldtoilet Wasnt it the opposite?
[0:01:29] <+anoldtoilet> @leith_aziz its probably harder than nocturne by default so idk.
[0:01:29] <+HollowMan190> persona 5 was only a few years ago
[0:01:39] <+cubbywolf> big landslides in bc means I can't get to Vancouver this week
[0:01:52] <+anoldtoilet> @anoldtoilet not in my opinion. 4 was pretty sterile and boring, 4a had a lot of great characters and a cool story. Dagda is great.
[0:02:01] <%holydeviant1> Never good v evil, always law v chaos
[0:02:02] <%Prevot> Jeh and Luci are at it again
[0:02:03] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz I meant cucked as in attention. Feels like people already moved on
[0:02:03] <+cubbywolf> oops wrong spot
[0:02:12] <DSD24> Ooooo Woolie started playing SMT5?
[0:02:15] <nabs96> Me too
[0:02:22] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Japan LOVES high school
[0:02:29] <rios> weeb dunnit
[0:02:30] <DSD24> I love SMT5 its so good!
[0:02:32] <Arqartur0> Imagine an anime that starts in... A Karaoke bar....
[0:02:41] <leith_aziz> I dont mind it, but it's also made me love Yakuza Like a Dragon for being so different
[0:02:46] <%holydeviant1> Fuck it, salaryman JRPG
[0:02:50] <+anoldtoilet> i was just about to mention yakuza lol
[0:02:53] <NeonBleu> Before you put the ball and chain on
[0:02:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Arqartur0 Followed by a framed murder? Kappa
[0:02:55] <nabs96> Yakuza 7
[0:02:56] <Arqartur0> and an ADULT BABY MAN APPEARS
[0:03:01] <%Indigo_Automaton> Highschool sucked
[0:03:02] <+BananaSlammuh> @holydeviant1 yakuza then?
[0:03:06] <leith_aziz> Like im a Persona fan, so I dont get to be a hypocrite pickyAYAYA
[0:03:11] <+anoldtoilet> but that ones almost still the same, because Ichiban has been in jail since basically his high school age and has arrested development with a teen's brain
[0:03:12] <DSD24> High School sucked
[0:03:15] <nabs96> high school was fun but I'm glad it's over
[0:03:17] <%holydeviant1> That uniform tho
[0:03:18] <+eanscrale> It's either that, or walking out of a prison
[0:03:18] <velgaduere> I can't believe SMT 5 murdered Persona 5 in cold blood
[0:03:22] <%Prevot> with a uniform that's WAY too stylish
[0:03:24] <+Jiggisnipe> in Japan, the only people who have adventures or freedom are high schoolers and criminals
[0:03:24] <%holydeviant1> It's a fucking cool ass unform
[0:03:34] <DSD24> @Prevot Oh yeah those flowers are stylish
[0:03:38] <%Vigonept> woolie on another trope hate?
[0:03:46] <%ennui_on_me> Japanese stories for teenagers just go too hard for me to stop being into...
[0:03:52] <%Solidnick18> yep
[0:03:55] <%Prevot> also the boy's uniform looks way better cause it has the flowers on the pants too
[0:03:58] <+eanscrale> It's what makes highschooler criminals so cool
[0:04:07] <SixthShinx> aww yeah, the suicide fences

[0:04:14] <+mechslayer71> ah yes, podcast part 2, as regularly scheduled
[0:04:16] <Arqartur0> highschool kinda sucked for me; college was the more free place, and the first years after... Hell, I got to live in a little artist village in the mountains in southern Mexico
[0:04:21] <nabs96> @sixthshinx or the sexfences
[0:04:26] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[0:04:30] <leith_aziz> Allright, you can tell Woolie's fatigued by this. Well, im not even 20 years old, ao I cant say im as bothered
[0:04:37] <%KiwamiKiryu> the suicide sex fences
[0:04:41] <disflipmat> Dammit Japan make a game for me, a mid 30s black man from North America
[0:04:55] <%Vigonept> what if ya didnt tho
[0:04:59] <%Lion_kun> PERSONA 6 OFFICE LADY DO IT ATLUS
[0:05:07] <brunoberserk> sorry , im late , what woolie is talking about ?
[0:05:07] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's why Aggretsuko is so great
[0:05:07] <OldManDeckardCain> asking a company to take risks LUL
[0:05:08] <+MarkUriah> college would work so much better honestly
[0:05:13] <Arqartur0> a 35 year-old highschool student?
[0:05:19] <%Lion_kun> Office is like a prison.  Stone Ocean!
[0:05:19] <+mechslayer71> why doesn't Japan cater to their core; alt blade guys from Canada in their mid 30s Madge
[0:05:19] <DSD24> Persona 2 has cool adults
[0:05:20] <GeoGio3> the gang is 26-35 see what happens
[0:05:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> NEET adventures!
[0:05:28] <+eanscrale> Fuck the police
[0:05:29] <+Jiggisnipe> 21 Jump Street it Kappa
[0:05:30] <+mechslayer71> al black*
[0:05:32] <+Shishi1205> But woolie highschool is the only period salary men can fondly remember
[0:05:33] <%Deekman> For SMT specifically I think it's better in highschool just thematically since it's when you choose the person you want to be and form friendships.
[0:05:33] <%Vigonept> your like 18 in astral chain
[0:05:33] <%ennui_on_me> PLAY SMT STRANGE JOURNEY DAMMIT
[0:05:34] <leith_aziz> High school doesnt even have to be the setting. It worked for TWEWY
[0:05:34] <sendart> Highschool + Holy grail war
[0:05:38] <KombatJunkeeTV> when dokapon journey? LUL
[0:05:39] <+mechslayer71> alt black *
[0:05:48] <CatRidder> college adventures where everyone is drunk
[0:05:50] <%KiwamiKiryu> P2 was cool and some of them were adults
[0:05:52] <nabs96> I feel like SMT being in high school is weird tho p much most of their protags have been high schoolers anyway
[0:05:53] <DSD24> @ennui_on_me Strange Journey IS SO GOOD
[0:05:59] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:06:05] <DSD24> Doom Slayer RPG protagonist
[0:06:07] <nabs96> Strange Journey is the objective BEST SMT
[0:06:08] <+MTLxSpider> "fuck your school life, go kill god now"
[0:06:23] <DSD24> Only problem with Redux is I wish it got a Dub
[0:06:24] <+2Vibe2Check> Are there rivers in the desert? Kappa
[0:06:26] <+Shishi1205> A good funny manga about college shenanigans is Grand Blue
[0:06:26] <%X2Eliah> Wait Japan has deserts?
[0:06:28] <%baka_sugoi> FIGHT GOD
[0:06:37] <Crowroost> The spice must flow
[0:06:52] <DSD24> But SMT 5 has a super beautiful protagonist so it balances out
[0:06:55] <%Lion_kun> P5 Strikers is the best persona game
[0:06:55] <%fetrigon> @deekman I'd say college is more like that, but then again not everyone experiences that
[0:06:58] <DSD24> You see that hair?
[0:06:59] <%KiwamiKiryu> can you make Mara wash your clothes or give you a massage tho?
[0:06:59] <leith_aziz> You know, I've never played a MAINLINE SMT game, but I've always loved looking at the art for SMT demon interpretation/design.
[0:06:59] <%Prevot> NOY YET
[0:07:02] <%Lion_kun> Fight me nerds
[0:07:02] <BigYanno> Speaking of grime, grunge and muck, DARK SOULS!
[0:07:03] <+Shishi1205> It has a dune
[0:07:04] <BlackermanZX> yet
[0:07:04] <+MTLxSpider> monkaS
[0:07:05] <+cubbywolf> currently
[0:07:07] <LVL1_Scumbag> Are there plans?
[0:07:10] <%Solidnick18> yet
[0:07:12] <BlueEagle2395> monkaS global warming
[0:07:13] <+Shishi1205> Like a big ass dune
[0:07:13] <Tracazoid> Godzilla could still arrive and change that
[0:07:14] <+2Vibe2Check> Is that a threat Woolie? LUL
[0:07:15] <RickyRelucent> Japanese ppl settled in the desert?
[0:07:15] <%Deekman> @fetrigon In Japan though?
[0:07:15] <BurdRightsActivist> It has a DUNE
[0:07:21] <leith_aziz> They look so interesting, and im a guy who loves lore, so the designs make me think of tehir inspiration
[0:07:26] <nabs96> One of the best things about Persona/SMT for me is how each Persona game has something new (mystery/heists) whereas for SMT it's always post apocalypse but it's a new apocalypse EVERY TIME and its GREAT
[0:07:32] <+BananaSlammuh> SMT tends to get post apocalyptic
[0:07:32] <Crowroost> The Kwisatz Kusunoha
[0:07:34] <Arqartur0> well... There's a thing called Climate Change...
[0:07:35] <%robosqueeb> PRAISE YHWH
[0:07:38] <%holydeviant1> Is this before or after Tokyo pulls a fallen london
[0:07:44] <%Prevot> the one constant in all SMT games, Tokyo gets fuuuuuuucked
[0:07:46] <Scrapl> there might be deserts in a 1000 years
[0:07:49] <DSD24> @holydeviant1 Its after
[0:07:51] <youngking_kush> What's Demons are involve anything is fair game
[0:07:55] <+cubbywolf> those dunes are right by the water though
[0:07:57] <disflipmat> Welcome to Shin Megami Tensei where there's always more and it's always worse

[0:09:28] <%fetrigon> @deekman I meant in general. I'm not sure on the specifics of university life in Japan. I heard it's super lax and mostly lectures.

[0:11:06] <leith_aziz> Speaking of SMT V, I dont know of the context behind the track, but "Nahobino" is an atmospheric slap
[0:11:07] <+Shishi1205> I ain't never scared
[0:11:08] <disflipmat> I like Reggarth cause he's a cool guy who doesn't afraid of anything
[0:11:09] <%Vigonept> dont scare a nuthing
[0:11:17] <Crowroost> Damn Gods, they ruined Anor Londo

[0:17:46] <+Bitscreed> I always enjoyed the music in this little area.
[0:17:53] <skewerstar> Wait, they also beat CD!?
[0:17:55] <%Lion_kun> Catacombs is a dead end.
[0:17:58] <%a_goth_pancake> how dare you, spears rule.
[0:18:00] <DSD24> Lancers are the best!

[0:18:15] <+セビー> spears are underrated in fantasy
[0:18:17] <youngking_kush> Spears are rad
[0:18:18] <+MageValerie> the design on that shield really is beautiful
[0:18:22] <%Indigo_Automaton> Spears and polearms are humanity's oldest and most reliable weapons for a reason
[0:18:25] <+askalta> he also won't need a slab to max out the weapon
[0:18:26] <youngking_kush> Shout out Lubu
[0:18:30] <justcallmebobplease> I vote for ARCH TREE
[0:18:32] <DSD24> The best spear user is Bandana Waddle Dee
[0:18:35] <VHGS> Swords get bodied by tight hallways. Spears are the shit.

[0:19:37] <BigYanno> drake valley is annoying as hell
[0:19:40] <%Indigo_Automaton> YEYEYE
[0:19:41] <%Solidnick18> the big gate opened
[0:19:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SKELETON WARRIORS
[0:19:43] <sendart> valley of the drakes is very short
[0:19:44] <Xaeveax> Oh yeah, catacombs time
[0:19:44] <iamnuff> Glad to know that the hat is staying tho
[0:19:45] <%hax_metatron> Warning: Some areas have really tricky paths back up if you go too deep down those paths before you get the Lordvessel
[0:19:46] <Johannen> Yay, Catacombs are great
[0:19:47] <BigYanno> SKELETON WARRORS
[0:19:47] <+TheFrancix> YOOOO

[0:19:57] <+セビー> @iamnuff he has points in int, no reason not to
[0:19:57] <%patriotrenegade> Hope he hits that first bonfire
[0:19:58] <LunarRemix> Wait how does he knows the name?
[0:20:04] <iamnuff> Sen's Funhouse
[0:20:05] <%a_goth_pancake> watch him get the daddy mask, too.
[0:20:05] <Chatterbox1991> DADA!
[0:20:08] <Ros_Bef> BONEZONE TIME
[0:20:09] <legion0047> valley is not really a zone
[0:20:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @iamnuff its pretty busted until late game
[0:20:12] <+Axle13j> Sen's FunHouse
[0:20:13] <%hax_metatron> Andre said the name
[0:20:14] <youngking_kush> @iamnuff with the build he has we're hoping he ends up with q certain famous weapon by the end
[0:20:15] <Sonny_Firestorm> I tried asking Woolie about Yakuza North Star thrice now and he didn't anwser. Is he ignoring it on purpose or just bad luck?
[0:20:17] <%Solidnick18> real fucking nito area
[0:20:17] <%hax_metatron> ANDRE SAID IT
[0:20:18] <XrBubba> 16 days too late for Holoween. Damn.
[0:20:21] <Johannen> Bone Lord awaits
[0:20:25] <elshadow7> If we don't care about Sif's cutscene, basin would be cool.
[0:20:26] <legion0047> its a halfway with doors
[0:20:46] <Xaeveax> I can't wait for him to get all the way down only to find the big orange fog wall
[0:20:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> IT opens if you donate enough humanity?
[0:20:48] <%ozzrabbit> While I respect Woolie’s choice not to intervene, I REALLY hope he stops Reggie from going into the Artorias Crest area.
[0:20:54] <pyjama_day> 30 humanity is a lot to give...
[0:20:54] <pennykettle_> I highly recommend leaving a bloodstain in the blighttown swamp before you leave, you should be able to see it from Firelink Shrine! It will show Reggie the world connectivity. You could also leave a bloodstain on the big arch where you got the eagle shield!
[0:21:00] <+pectusumbra> 10 and 30 humanity are the things I heared
[0:21:01] <+TheFrancix> DUMP HUMANITY REGGIE
[0:21:05] <Crowroost> That's behind the Lordvessel Wall though
[0:21:08] <%Double_Tap_That> Time to farm rats
[0:21:09] <+セビー> basin, if for nothing else, would get a newt reaction from the hydra
[0:21:15] <%X2Eliah> Eeeh just let Reggie play
[0:21:16] <legion0047> door is somewhere else, that place is spiky boy
[0:21:37] <%robosqueeb> you should let Reggie get egged up Kappa
[0:21:38] <iamnuff> going from the youtube to the live show is so weird. Feels like I lept forwards through time.
[0:21:46] <TheRaubvogel> How about the tree?
[0:21:48] <nxflre> @ozzrabbit why?
[0:21:49] <+セビー> eggy reggie LUL
[0:21:51] <oneimportantthing> Man do the funhouse!
[0:21:53] <%ozzrabbit> I know, but that thing that happens is important too and far too easy to miss.
[0:21:59] <Crowroost> If he wants to Darkroot, let him Valley of Drakes to get there imo, there's the elevator...
[0:21:59] <legion0047> but the roundabout sucks
[0:22:08] <youngking_kush> Big cats
[0:22:19] <youngking_kush> Multiple lol
[0:22:20] <elshadow7> Hydra + a good forest run will put you real close to 20k
[0:22:23] <+pectusumbra> @Crowroost he was saying skeletons
[0:22:23] <+セビー> he needs a surface bonfire, so darkroot or sens
[0:22:26] <Johannen> Shame we missed Patches in Catacombs
[0:22:30] <%Indigo_Automaton> @iamnuff Technically you did
[0:22:32] <+askalta> why is he back here
[0:22:41] <iamnuff> Welcome to the Bone Zone.
[0:22:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:22:46] <pennykettle_> @woolieversus try dying and leaving a bloodstain in the swamp and show how you can see it all the way from Firelink csbeastBIT
[0:22:47] <+RyTYoung> @askalta this is where the last session left off
[0:22:48] <BigYanno> there is nothing good in the Bone Zone. Only pain
[0:22:56] <BurdRightsActivist> Crush 40? Pog

[0:23:24] <anachronologist> WELCOME TO BLIGHT TOWN MOFO
[0:23:25] <pyjama_day> hes a goofy goober ROCK
[0:23:29] <theDromader> These dudes always give me a  hart attack when I least expect it
[0:23:31] <pennykettle_> there's a ton of places you can do that, it's so cool
[0:23:33] <AbnormalVoid> never seen them get this far LUL
[0:23:34] <+AmanDotZip> you can see your souls? thats really sick
[0:23:35] <%Deekman> holy shit i've never seen them go that far
[0:23:36] <%FallenAngelZelos> wow i've never seen them chase that far
[0:23:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> keep rollin rollin rollin
[0:23:40] <%Josef_Stryker> WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU
[0:23:42] <+AmanDotZip> i didnt even know you could see swamp from firelink
[0:23:52] <youngking_kush> Pretty sure I saw that on a YT video yeah
[0:23:52] <pennykettle_> you can see Firelink from blighttown
[0:23:56] <Pubstar_LTD> Watch them throw a rock and knock him off the elevator LUL
[0:24:03] <Scrapl> this is the remaster?
[0:24:10] <pyjama_day> i believe so
[0:24:14] <+AmanDotZip> btw woolie are you magfesting this year?
[0:24:14] <Pubstar_LTD> Fps is stable? Yep, remastered
[0:24:18] <+セビー> theres a channel that made a bunch of videos about zone connectivity
[0:24:34] <+TheFrancix> didn't he open the shortcut to firelink?
[0:24:34] <Johannen> Getting into catacombs might be tough without the bonfire)
[0:24:37] <Scrapl> looks similar but framerate is a pretty big deal huh
[0:24:38] <+Your_heals> ooo blightown time PridePog
[0:24:43] <%Deekman> no bonfire at firelink so drakes is gonna be a huge pain in the ass
[0:24:47] <TheHylianGuard> the remaster seems like a real mixed bag
[0:24:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 360 version did it too
[0:24:53] <elshadow7> Yeah I played over 1k hours on PtDE and never ran into that once.
[0:24:56] <Pubstar_LTD> Yeah blighttown in the original game had terrible fps
[0:25:04] <pennykettle_> I'm doing my own playthrough right now, you can see the valley of Drake's bridge from the undead burg among other places
[0:25:04] <Pubstar_LTD> well for some I guess
[0:25:06] <resloxxx> @A_German_spy OH GOD i just remembered, will they be taking the frampth or kaathe for lore?
[0:25:07] <TheHylianGuard> on the plus side to the remaster, I don't need DS fix. The downside is other things are broke
[0:25:09] <%Your_heals> woolieLORE
[0:25:19] <pyjama_day> @Pubstar_LTD none of the fire loaded in for me back in the day xD
[0:25:24] <legion0047> Smith bonfire is probably best
[0:25:25] <BigYanno> The convenient elevator to andre from firelink means that's usually where I sit when I do this
[0:25:27] <Johannen> Catacombs is a great area to play before Sen for pacing
[0:25:28] <DSD24> 1 Star
[0:25:29] <iamnuff> I KNOW, RIGHT?
[0:25:31] <BurdRightsActivist> did he find the lake?
[0:25:32] <legion0047> elevator to firelink
[0:25:33] <Pubstar_LTD> LUL thats rough
[0:25:35] <%A_German_spy> @resloxxx Your guess is as good as mine. It all depends on where Reggie goes, in what order.
[0:25:44] <%Lion_kun> Wait till he gets to Izalith.
[0:25:45] <+Bitscreed> Someone get Reggie a "I survived Blightcon 2021" tshirt
[0:25:45] <%FallenAngelZelos> Going from here to Sen's is ROUGH though
[0:25:54] <+セビー> i tried loading up a ps3 save to get platinum and man, i never noticed how bad blighttown was at the time
[0:25:56] <+RyTYoung> The stank consumed you Kappa
[0:25:56] <pennykettle_> someone is making a mod to procedurally generate The Depths infinitely
[0:25:57] <legion0047> Your sinuses have been burnt out
[0:25:58] <Tracazoid> Reggie, Dokapon or Blighttown? Which drains your Soul more?
[0:25:59] <%Indigo_Automaton> Started from the stinky bottom now we're here
[0:26:01] <royb2> Rise from the trashpile reggie
[0:26:05] <theDromader> From Soft are huge fans of Shrek apparently
[0:26:05] <BlackermanZX> blighttown changes a mf
[0:26:07] <Darky04> Hyperbolic Time Chamber
[0:26:08] <+TheFrancix> BLIGHTTOWN ARC ENDED
[0:26:13] <Ros_Bef> Poop arc
[0:26:13] <%the_smiler_in_the_dark> but you do gotta come back for other area you found
[0:26:14] <elshadow7> @pennykettle_ Why? Why are people awful like this?
[0:26:15] <DSD24> He did get Kaioken
[0:26:19] <iamnuff> Blighttown does indeed change a MF
[0:26:19] <youngking_kush> He went to all the booths at BlightCon
[0:26:20] <cheapdoc> Would you say IT BUILDS CHARACTER???
[0:26:21] <%Rafraud> You got the fundies but not the strength
[0:26:25] <PunkZedB> BLIGHTCON IS OVER
[0:26:28] <youngking_kush> Got all the swag
[0:26:34] <pyjama_day> Power within is like...my favourite thing ever
[0:26:39] <royb2> This is the goodbye party of blighttown
[0:26:40] <pyjama_day> combined with the chaos blade
[0:26:44] <%FallenAngelZelos> SWING FIRST
[0:26:50] <%Indigo_Automaton> Has Reggie parried those guys yet?
[0:26:56] <justcallmebobplease> Did Reggie grab the Server?
[0:26:58] <%baka_sugoi> B U T T
[0:27:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> daaamn
[0:27:04] <BurdRightsActivist> @pennykettle_ Think! Just think of the potential gameplay variety! There's practically an infinite depth 4Head LUL
[0:27:09] <+Axle13j> o7

[0:27:12] <%Deekman> See you for Blightcon 2022
[0:27:18] <Xaeveax> Blightcon 2021 has concluded! Be sure to pick up your goodie bags on the way out.
[0:27:20] <+pectusumbra> he'll be back to pick up pyromancies
[0:27:22] <+theoldone001> I like to think these dudes poop themselves after they die, hence the Dung Pies
[0:27:24] <skewerstar> Is Reggie planning on doing a magic hybrid build with the Great Soul Arrow?
[0:27:25] <cheapdoc> The orgy is still going
[0:27:25] <legion0047> Don't forget your complementory bag of shit
[0:27:29] <cheapdoc> in fact it's expanding
[0:27:34] <youngking_kush> See you next year Blight Fans!
[0:27:39] <available_line> The real treasure was the shit we looted along the way.
[0:27:44] <+セビー> chaos daughter wont be warpable until he walks back, so one more trip left
[0:27:50] <Xaeveax> @available_line So inspirational.
[0:27:57] <Ros_Bef> I just realized Reggie has no bonfire for skeleboys
[0:28:03] <%Indigo_Automaton> What about GutterCon tho? LUL
[0:28:06] <iamnuff> the burg?
[0:28:15] <+swesterly> Wellllll blightcon does have one or two more tangential events….
[0:28:20] <%Deekman> the bonfire near andre can take the church elevator back down to firelink
[0:28:21] <%Josef_Stryker> Undead Parish I usually go to
[0:28:22] <Pubstar_LTD> @セビー Oh is this always the case? I swear I always thought I forgot to light it LUL
[0:28:24] <+セビー> best fire is parish
[0:28:29] <pyjama_day> how would an undead burg-er taste?
[0:28:33] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @swesterly the shitpie fest
[0:28:34] <+TheFrancix> wraithcon is cool too
[0:28:35] <nxflre> lmao Reggie....

[0:28:39] <elshadow7> Can't wait for Black Gulchcon 2022!
[0:28:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> and it's kindled
[0:28:40] <TenorSounds> Are we skipping the inside of the tree?
[0:28:50] <iamnuff> Oh, yeah. Andre is better than burg. I forgot about his bonnie.
[0:28:51] <%sewermonk> firelink music hits so hard
[0:28:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TenorSounds not skipping, doing it later

[0:31:44] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:31:44] <RickyRelucent> what u did
[0:31:48] <BigYanno> he's going to probably do something really STUPID
[0:31:53] <elshadow7> Subtle LUL
[0:31:53] <legion0047> He WILL attend blightcon
[0:31:55] <+Bitscreed> He's going to immediately book tickets for BlightCon 2022.
[0:32:01] <iamnuff> He might get huge pyromancy, or he might die in the swamp...
[0:32:01] <Johannen> Woolie the spoiler king
[0:32:05] <BigYanno> can he even see her?
[0:32:06] <available_line> Can he even get to her?
[0:32:08] <brunoberserk> PROTECT HIM
[0:32:13] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie just tell him to say no
[0:32:13] <%Josef_Stryker> PROTECC
[0:32:14] <%a_goth_pancake> he's waiting to press checkout on his tickets
[0:32:15] <+TheFrancix> PROTECT THE BOI
[0:32:16] <RickyRelucent> sometimes to be nice
[0:32:17] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> hes going to blightcon ALONE
[0:32:17] <+pectusumbra> Reminder he was going to be EATEN in the depths
[0:32:18] <twoto858> Can he survive Blightcon?
[0:32:19] <Johannen> cmon
[0:32:19] <RickyRelucent> you gotta be an asshole
[0:32:20] <%fetrigon> he could do something really bad or maybe not.
[0:32:26] <+Jiggisnipe> We all did LUL
[0:32:27] <+Axle13j> "holy shit where'd you get that? blightcon? word?"
[0:32:28] <BigYanno> we all show him the first time

[0:32:29] <%Deekman> He's booking tickets for Blightcon Winter
[0:32:32] <+セビー> maybe.. unless..
[0:32:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cmoooon
[0:32:34] <binocu__lars> give the man his forbidden knowledge
[0:32:35] <%fetrigon> part of chat is lying
[0:32:36] <elshadow7> Regarth the selfish
[0:32:39] <+LandOfTheWay> don't blame woolie for just telling him; it's basically impossible to know your first time through
[0:32:40] <pepinillomaton> booooo
[0:32:43] <Johannen> boooooooo
[0:32:44] <%Deekman> it's not as big but just as filthy
[0:32:46] <FrostedZaibatsu> Friends show each other their power
[0:32:50] <+Rasheedt> BibleThump
[0:32:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> To be fair, Woolie saved Reggie from some otherwise unknowable shit
[0:32:54] <+kewlmyc> HE TRUSTED YOU
[0:32:55] <RickyRelucent> I also like my firelin,k populated
[0:32:56] <%fetrigon> :)
[0:32:56] <nxflre> Lie down try not to cry cry aa lot
[0:32:56] <Wyldesquirrel> Has anyone tried telling Reggie the spellsword style he craves is featured more in DS2/DS3 than in the early ones?
[0:32:58] <didipackums1> Not sharing your knowledge….selfish
[0:32:58] <JetpackMcQuack> share tech
[0:32:58] <+Jiggisnipe> it's such a lame way to lose a cool dude
[0:33:03] <GeoGio3> PoroSad
[0:33:17] <pennykettle_> If we avoid all sad endings, we won't finish any questlines LUL Solaire's good ending is my bad ending
[0:33:19] <+tuchpi> I love the bell ringing from other players
[0:33:21] <RickyRelucent> It grows horribly empty after a whiler
[0:33:25] <pyjama_day> thank you Woolie
[0:33:26] <JetpackMcQuack> You can have it for 30k souls :)
[0:33:33] <%FallenAngelZelos> Good heads up
[0:33:34] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ahhh good point Woolz
[0:33:36] <Xaeveax> Greyrat was the same
[0:33:38] <brunoberserk> miyazaki wants you to KILL JIM
[0:33:38] <+Lordgale119> they have something against our boy here
[0:33:42] <%pupil31> monkaS
[0:33:43] <RickyRelucent> canonically
[0:33:47] <Johannen> Everyone dies
[0:33:47] <RickyRelucent> probably dies hard AF
[0:33:48] <Tracazoid> Dark Souls 3 is even meaner
[0:33:55] <derap41> If you've bought everything then you can tell him
[0:34:00] <+robertoszek> it's a tragic end, fitting
[0:34:00] <%a_goth_pancake> the J.C. Penny model lives!
[0:34:02] <%holydeviant1> one community taglined it SHIT GETS CURSED, ALL YOUR FRIENDS DIE
[0:34:03] <+セビー> helping ppl results in death, always
[0:34:04] <RickyRelucent> You find him
[0:34:05] <+MarkUriah> blightcon goes too hard
[0:34:07] <RickyRelucent> sadge
[0:34:11] <%Josef_Stryker> DS3 is especially cruel with two characters afaik
[0:34:12] <available_line> It's Blittown, of course he doesn't make it.
[0:34:13] <AbnormalVoid> he can't find her, cause he's not good enough
[0:34:14] <Johannen> Everyone questline end in death...that's the whole theme
[0:34:14] <BurdRightsActivist> BLIGHTCON'S TOO HARD
[0:34:15] <+AmanDotZip> really? he made it for me in my memory
[0:34:16] <@Solidus_113> the Great Swamp has nothing on BlightCon
[0:34:16] <BigYanno> BLIGHTCON NEVER ENDS
[0:34:17] <+Jiggisnipe> he wasn't ready for Blightcon
[0:34:17] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Greirat ResidentSleeper
[0:34:20] <GeoGio3> He never found her PoroSad
[0:34:20] <pepinillomaton> but he has no purpouse anymore once u met quelana
[0:34:26] <RickyRelucent> same with the crestfallen
[0:34:32] <RickyRelucent> talk enough to him, and he fucks off
[0:34:38] <elshadow7> I don't remember, his quest doesn't have any other ending, right?
[0:34:40] <+pectusumbra> I mean you can let him go after you buy his stuff
[0:34:40] <+セビー> greirat NotLikeThis
[0:34:43] <@Solidus_113> Get Flash Sweat, it's really good for lava defense
[0:34:46] <TenorSounds> Right choice
[0:34:46] <Johannen> Same with Griggs, everyone dies
[0:34:47] <+MageValerie> I think the rite of passage is just playing through the game
[0:34:47] <Wyldesquirrel> Doesnt he hollow anyways when you meet pyro teacher #2?
[0:34:48] <iamnuff> Buy extra fireballs. They're good
[0:34:48] <+ThePich> @pepinillomaton he has the purpose of not having to leg it to blightcon every time
[0:34:53] <+Orbit_Boy> Woolie The Saviour
[0:34:55] <pennykettle_> I think he just pauses if he doesn't go down, there's not an alternate story
[0:34:56] <binocu__lars> DS teaches you that talking to anyone can only lead to pain
[0:34:57] <+AmanDotZip> oh jk yeah he goes crazy
[0:34:58] <RickyRelucent> same with the church faith vendor, but i cant say too much
[0:34:58] <JetpackMcQuack> a lesson on secrets
[0:35:02] <+Axle13j> Chad Flesh
[0:35:05] <+セビー> once you buy out his inventory tho, no harm losing him.. i guess
[0:35:07] <%Josef_Stryker> @elshadow7 He either goes to find the secret of chaos pyromancy or he stays in firelink
[0:35:14] <+LandOfTheWay> @elshadow7 no that's pretty much the only ending, unless you count him just chilling here in firelink
[0:35:18] <pennykettle_> Frampt scared the fuck out of me my first playthrough
[0:35:20] <%fetrigon> well ok woolie told him. no more anti spoiler gaslighting from me LUL
[0:35:22] <Dio_TR> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:35:25] <elshadow7> @Josef_Stryker Yeah, that's what I thought.
[0:35:26] <%Deekman> gotta hand out all the mudpie merch he got from blightcon

[0:35:29] <%CodenameChaz> Avoiding the snake-shaped elephant in the ruins
[0:35:34] <iamnuff> To be fair, it's scurry
[0:35:36] <Tracazoid> "Can I fight the final boss before I talk to that thing."
[0:35:39] <%Josef_Stryker> If only we could escort him or some shit
[0:35:39] <BigYanno> talk to the people you actually like before you speak to the giant stinking tooth snake
[0:35:40] <Johannen> Woolie is keeping his friend instead of leting him go for his dream
[0:35:44] <+pectusumbra> I mean that thing is gross
[0:35:47] <TenorSounds> You should go visit Andre
[0:35:49] <Ros_Bef> Reggies heading towards attunement bloat
[0:35:52] <TenorSounds> It’s been awhile
[0:35:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @tracazoid Kappa
[0:35:54] <%Josef_Stryker> Alot of problems could be avoided if we could do a brief escort mission

[0:43:35] <Johannen> and chunks yeah
[0:43:36] <+Shishi1205> worth if you dont need colour slabs chunks etc

[0:50:31] <pennykettle_> I beat O&S last night, I'm doing my first ever SL1 playthrough FeelsGoodMan
[0:50:33] <+ThePich> @Jewoodsforreal one stage
[0:50:37] <Dabrikishaw> Someone tell Reggie to pump DEX to 18 so he can actually use that Black Knight Sword.
[0:50:43] <+Shishi1205> Andre you already have his ember
[0:50:50] <+Shishi1205> The hell are you on
[0:50:50] <+セビー> It was never pointed out that the first time an item is picked up it gets added to item bar
[0:50:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:50:51] <RickyRelucent> good thing twinkling only goes upto +5
[0:50:56] <jumpyhugs> @pennykettle_ poggy woggy!
[0:51:02] <+MarkUriah> @Dabrikishaw he going str int it looks like
[0:51:04] <+Shishi1205> @セビー not in remastered
[0:51:09] <%X2Eliah> Isnt the Black Knight Sword worse than what Reggie is using now?
[0:51:11] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Doesnt the crow exchange Mosses for twinkling?
[0:51:16] <MeImoth> There is twinkling in the way down to the hydra... or in the barrel before taurus, depending on which crystal lizard reggy alreay found
[0:51:21] <RickyRelucent> @Johannen just once
[0:51:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @rickyrelucent once per type of moss
[0:51:34] <RickyRelucent> maybe once for every moss
[0:51:36] <Dabrikishaw> @X2Eliah Damage-wise it's much better.
[0:51:36] <RickyRelucent> unsure
[0:51:39] <Johannen> I dont think they traded mosses
[0:51:39] <RickyRelucent> there we go
[0:51:41] <+Shishi1205> he already has the lizards he can
[0:51:43] <jumpyhugs> @RickyRelucent correct
[0:51:45] <RickyRelucent> cheers coballt
[0:51:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You traded the Sack for the Demon's Great Hammer
[0:51:51] <%Deekman> won't going down the whole piss him off though?
[0:51:53] <%Seancicle> yeesh was?
[0:51:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 1 for red, 1 for purple, 2 for toxic purple
[0:52:07] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus And an Egg Vermifuge
[0:52:15] <Johannen> I dont think you had those at that time
[0:52:16] <Dabrikishaw> well, if Reggie isn't interested that's fine
[0:52:16] <+Mendin> he hasn't traded moss
[0:52:27] <legion0047> no moss trade yet
[0:52:30] <TenorSounds> All of the different kinds of moss
[0:52:30] <RickyRelucent> thats one upgrade
[0:52:31] <+セビー> snuggly will say if youve traded them before
[0:52:35] <RickyRelucent> sounds like a plan
[0:52:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> do a plunging attack in Frampt's hole with your catching pole +2 Kreygasm KappaPride
[0:52:36] <%Deekman> does he have a blacksmith that can upgrade with twinkling yet?
[0:52:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> The clump market is booming rn
[0:52:38] <+Lordgale119> he did NOT trade moss, he didn't have any before blightcon
[0:52:40] <+Shishi1205> I thin k he traded sunlight medal, sack and vermifuge
[0:52:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> shits hot
[0:52:50] <Johannen> @RickyRelucent Might be 2
[0:52:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hells yea
[0:52:58] <legion0047> @Shishi1205 Yea, sounds about right
[0:52:58] <pennykettle_> This crow is sick of taking you so far
[0:53:03] <RickyRelucent> he has a verimifuge?
[0:53:04] <+Jiggisnipe> trip and fall Kappa
[0:53:10] <RickyRelucent> i know u can get two but i forget
[0:53:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @rickyrelucent he had it
[0:53:13] <Ros_Bef> He’s gonna be sad at the painted world
[0:53:16] <RickyRelucent> one from the egg guy
[0:53:21] <MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 3 years!
[0:53:24] <%Hapsam> getting down on frampt is kinda hot, but i hope he forgets to do it for the oral action later on
[0:53:25] <+Shishi1205> @RickyRelucent He got one from one of the frog drops
[0:53:30] <AbnormalVoid> 🐔
[0:53:32] <pennykettle_> When you get back, you have an amazing view of blighttown up here, if you want to look
[0:53:32] <RickyRelucent> :o
[0:53:42] <+Shishi1205> Reggarth the luckiest
[0:53:47] <+Lordgale119> @Deekman he can upgrade twinkling in his smithbox
[0:53:49] <Johannen> @RickyRelucent 1 for blood and poison and 2 for toxin, might be 2 upgrades
[0:53:58] <pennykettle_> Reggarth the Twinkling
[0:53:59] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:54:08] <RickyRelucent> warm!
[0:54:09] <%Josef_Stryker> What's Reggie doing back in the Asylum? Did he never beat the Stray Demon?
[0:54:10] <RickyRelucent> soft!
[0:54:11] <RickyRelucent> caw
[0:54:12] <%Josef_Stryker> Oh
[0:54:12] <kingra> Bird <3
[0:54:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> warm and soft
[0:54:18] <+RyTYoung> birb
[0:54:18] <RickyRelucent> [Happy Caw Noises]
[0:54:20] <Crownaux0> birb
[0:54:23] <subjectg> @josef_stryker we’re here for birb
[0:54:23] <glass_marcus> oh he beat him
[0:54:24] <+セビー> upgrade is 1 1 2 2 4 for 10 total iirc
[0:54:26] <+Shishi1205> he only has 1 blooming
[0:54:37] <XrBubba> Kind of hope he presses B and backsteps off of the cliff.
[0:54:41] <pennykettle_> Is toxic anywhere else in the game after the blighttown kids?
[0:54:42] <%X2Eliah> He doesnt need blooming anhmorey
[0:54:43] <+Lordgale119> he'll never need blooming again
[0:54:44] <Johannen> @Shishi1205 it is well worth it, no toxin left i think
[0:54:45] <%Indigo_Automaton> I hope Snuggly is in Elden Ring
[0:54:48] <DSD24> That's what Reggie needs
[0:54:52] <+RyTYoung> Will Elden Ring have a birb?
[0:54:55] <%livlinn> eugh, papers kiichiJabba
[0:54:56] <+pectusumbra> @Shishi1205 he is done with blighttown and could buy more if he needed
[0:54:56] <+Shishi1205> No yeah I mean he doesnt have 2 to trade
[0:54:58] <%mr_sups> Just popped in. What's happened?
[0:55:04] <+Shishi1205> Its super worth to trade
[0:55:07] <%livlinn> hello how's going
[0:55:08] <jumpyhugs> @Lordgale119 painted world ;)
[0:55:10] <subjectg> @johannen there’s the painted world, but that’s a ways off
[0:55:11] <legion0047> what a devious plan to make him clean his bar
[0:55:20] <+Lordgale119> you can only trade one anyway
[0:55:21] <RickyRelucent> reg is getting another upgrade or two @mr_sups
[0:55:22] <+Shishi1205> Its a cool weapon
[0:55:26] <+liquidzr0> can you drop the estus flask?
[0:55:29] <+セビー> reggie can always attune remedy for toxin zones (babies in tomb and bloatheads in painted)
[0:55:30] <twoah> Elden ring will have a birb and a Patches I’m sure
[0:55:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> @RyTYoung the dragon has feathers, so it's basically a dinosaur which is pretty much a bird
[0:55:33] <+Shishi1205> I had the BKH at this point
[0:55:48] <pennykettle_> blooming onion FeelsGoodMan
[0:55:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> don't need it? Woolie, there's no such thing as too much overkill
[0:55:50] <+Shishi1205> 2k or 1k?
[0:55:57] <+RyTYoung> @reallybigrocks birb confirmed
[0:56:00] <+Mendin> Speaking of the BKH, odds on Reg lucksacking himself one when he finds the guy
[0:56:13] <+Shishi1205> 100%
[0:56:16] <+Lordgale119> no bet, his luck is insane
[0:56:23] <+Shishi1205> He already has 2 bk weapons
[0:56:23] <RickyRelucent> depends at what lvl u can hoof it to anor
[0:56:24] <pennykettle_> Quelaag can be the literal first boss after the tutorial, with the master key
[0:56:25] <+Shishi1205> or 3
[0:56:27] <DSD24> To kill anything that moves
[0:56:33] <RickyRelucent> or go new londo
[0:56:35] <Johannen> Should be 2 upgrades
[0:56:41] <%hax_metatron> Bone
[0:56:43] <Ros_Bef> Bone
[0:56:45] <KingDrPimp> If the bird is in Elden Ring you know its gonna be hidden well
[0:56:48] <RickyRelucent> lots of newer played tend to leave new londo and catacombs unthill late game
[0:56:48] <%CodenameChaz> The run to the Zweihander from the start is always kind of harrowing
[0:56:48] <+pectusumbra> If chat's right it should be to +4
[0:56:49] <legion0047> think its 1|1|2|2|3
[0:56:55] <+Shishi1205> you can kill asylum like super early too
[0:56:55] <Johannen> ^
[0:57:04] <%mr_sups> Flashbacks
[0:57:08] <+Lordgale119> homeward bone from here
[0:57:09] <+セビー> quelaag can be first boss even w/o the key if you merc the sealer in new londo
[0:57:18] <Johannen> Ohh boi..Reggie is gonna get BUFF
[0:57:21] <+mechslayer71> in ds2 that kills you

[1:15:21] <AbnormalVoid> BUT
[1:15:24] <%patriotrenegade> I just went in with a Divine Great-axe
[1:15:27] <Johannen> @cubbywolf Its the Divine
[1:15:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> does it have to be divine?
[1:15:28] <RickyRelucent> did he not pppick up astora from the drake valley zombie drake?
[1:15:29] <pepinillomaton> boooo
[1:15:31] <RickyRelucent> aw
[1:15:33] <+cubbywolf> ah
[1:15:34] <pennykettle_> I prefer having to chase down the necromancers
[1:15:37] <SunsetJack> He can't use the mace?
[1:15:37] <+cubbywolf> im so used to dnd
[1:15:39] <RickyRelucent> oh right
[1:15:41] <AbnormalVoid> ZWEI ZWEI ZWEI
[1:15:43] <RickyRelucent> no thief key
[1:15:46] <dundore77> Doesn't he just need to kill the reanimator?
[1:15:50] <Johannen> @SunsetJack Mace does not have Divine
[1:15:50] <@Solidus_113> need something +5, then you can upgrade it to divine
[1:15:51] <%hax_metatron> Shouldn’t we tell REGGIE that that’s a way to do it without the divine weapon?
[1:15:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> @SunsetJack woolie is talking about divine
[1:15:55] <%holydeviant1> Vision of the valley...
[1:16:01] <+cubbywolf> survival horror?
[1:16:01] <Johannen> @hax_metatron NO
[1:16:08] <RickyRelucent> did he ever pick it up from dombnall PixelBob
[1:16:09] <+megaman_sentinel> i just finshed my faith playthrought
[1:16:10] <legion0047> you can do it without the thing btw
[1:16:11] <SarcFa> the mace does better physical against the skellies but that doesn't perma kill, need divine to perma kill
[1:16:12] <+anoldtoilet> i dont understand why woolie is coy about basic mechanics but outright spoils stuff like ceaseles
[1:16:13] <SunsetJack> For some reason, I thought blunt was helpful.
[1:16:14] <%Seancicle> Herlock Sholmes Reggie
[1:16:14] <+Bitscreed> I always end up going cleric in Souls games so the bone zone wasn't a big issue for me.
[1:16:17] <+セビー> only divine weapons will work, or killing a necromancer.. maces are just good at staggering skeles
[1:16:24] <legion0047> reggie, please read
[1:16:25] <RickyRelucent> it doesn't need to be a +5 blessed
[1:16:25] <Scrapl> just run faster than the skeletons?
[1:16:29] <Blank9> psht who needs anything but a titanite catch pole
[1:16:30] <legion0047> what you can actually modify
[1:16:39] <subjectg> white titanite only ever gets used for divine weapons so feel free to splurge
[1:16:41] <+cubbywolf> that dmg decrees is alot
[1:16:42] <ハクア> he only needs souls
[1:16:52] <pennykettle_> OI
[1:16:53] <JetpackMcQuack> OI
[1:16:54] <%holydeviant1> oooh! Not bad!
[1:16:54] <MeImoth> @hax_metatron using a divine weapon is way easier for the first time, since he doesn't know where to go for the necros, so with a divine he can take his time and clear in peace
[1:16:55] <+cubbywolf> pay him money
[1:16:55] <+セビー> heres the thing, if you never knew about necromancers then what solution would make sense
[1:16:58] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[1:17:03] <%hax_metatron> Killing the necromancers is how you’re supposed to do it though if you’re not a divine build
[1:17:08] <+megaman_sentinel> 400
[1:17:09] <DrkJP520> Now you have to disolve your sins
[1:17:09] <iamnuff> Put Divine on a mace instead.
[1:17:13] <+Shishi1205> peak into the funhouse for a quick buck

[1:17:33] <+Axle13j> Doin Andre dirty
[1:17:33] <+ThePich> whoops caps

[1:17:36] <+セビー> coz all the veterans in chat already know about the necros.. not reggie
[1:17:40] <+cubbywolf> i smite the undead

[1:17:41] <AbnormalVoid> he has not gone to the funhouse yet
[1:17:48] <+cubbywolf> hell no
[1:17:49] <iamnuff> Woolie, pls mention to him that It doesn't have to be the claymore, it just needs to be a +5 before he can divine it

[1:18:06] <subjectg> Even then i come down here with a divine weapon just because it’s less annoying
[1:18:06] <pennykettle_> How does Patches spawn in the Catacombs? He did on my FIRST playthrough and none since. Similar thing in DS3
[1:18:08] <nailwind> Reggarth is carrying some weight
[1:18:09] <AbnormalVoid> YES YES YES
[1:18:14] <SarcFa> he can always revert the claymore back to +5
[1:18:16] <+cubbywolf> divine piece of wood
[1:18:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> @anoldtoilet slashing damage, not as effective, but shouldn't matter
[1:18:19] <AbnormalVoid> IT'S PERFECT
[1:18:20] <+cubbywolf> thats the most legit weapon
[1:18:21] <%pupil31> LUL
[1:18:22] <+anoldtoilet> its a greatsword and hits hard enough to smash skellies. its one of the best weaps to put a unique enchant on
[1:18:25] <+HumanDoctor> never done skelly bois with sacred wep just suck it up
[1:18:25] <%Solidnick18> divine club
[1:18:26] <RickyRelucent> Kinda unsure, the one blessed weapon i like is the bell axe from 3
[1:18:26] <pennykettle_> Blessed door
[1:18:27] <iamnuff> Claymore is good, but Reggie isn't a faith build so reverting it would be wasteful.
[1:18:27] <+mechslayer71> the divine cock

[1:18:30] <%Indigo_Automaton> LIterally the wood of the cross

[1:18:34] <GeoGio3> a cross?
[1:18:35] <+megaman_sentinel> its the best
[1:18:35] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:18:37] <+Shishi1205> Its an occult wood

[1:18:51] <lord_of_the_dragons> divine wood = yggsdrasil
[1:18:51] <reasonance> yo man now I want to play a blessed greatclub cleric
[1:18:53] <legion0047> Long will it fly
[1:18:54] <+Shishi1205> ITS A WEAPON TO KILL GODS
[1:18:56] <RickyRelucent> he can just reset the claymore later
[1:18:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:18:56] <JoshWithASpoon> What's more badass than a 2x4 that's been blessed by God?
[1:18:57] <+Jiggisnipe> that's what I did :)
[1:18:57] <+vaderxyz1970> Holy Claymore
[1:18:58] <glass_marcus> you can revert the claymore anyway
[1:19:00] <DrkJP520> Divine Broken Straight Sword
[1:19:01] <RickyRelucent> its w/e
[1:19:01] <+cubbywolf> S O U L S
[1:19:02] <+Jiggisnipe> Holy Claymore
[1:19:06] <%hax_metatron> YEYEYEYE BACK TO THE TRUSTY CLAYMORE
[1:19:09] <+megaman_sentinel> 400
[1:19:11] <Xaeveax> Divine Claymore is gonna be fun
[1:19:14] <Wyldesquirrel> @pennykettle_  Patches spawn is tied to the way of white dudes questline if I recall
[1:19:14] <legion0047> Just go and kill 2 shrubs
[1:19:17] <RickyRelucent> Holy claymore actually does a fuckton of dmg
[1:19:18] <+vaderxyz1970> Claymore of Divine Wrath
[1:19:21] <+セビー> divine claymore, one of my all time favs
[1:19:21] <DSD24> You were at my side all along
[1:19:21] <+cubbywolf> boar head inosuke to the rescue
[1:19:22] <+furtive0ne> Holy Claymore 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
[1:19:27] <%ozzrabbit> Couldn’t he just grab the sword I The Valley of the Drakes?
[1:19:31] <iamnuff> Claymore is a very paladin weapon type
[1:19:31] <+Shishi1205> Good old days
[1:19:36] <+cubbywolf> is it though?
[1:19:36] <GeoGio3> Im conflicted on the one hand yay claymore, boo holy
[1:19:38] <AbnormalVoid> more like Snoremore ResidentSleeper
[1:19:38] <slipdog> that can come back next arc
[1:19:41] <pennykettle_> Okay wow, the BEST Patches interaction is probably unseen by most people. If you go into the Catacombs before Reah and her crew come, he does the funniest shit
[1:19:41] <glass_marcus> divine claymore is legit, using one in ng+ right now
[1:19:42] <RickyRelucent> Its a nice pockert weapon toi switch to from the +15one
[1:19:43] <+セビー> @ozzrabbit if he knew it was a thing, sure
[1:19:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @cubbywolf PIG ASSAULT
[1:19:46] <+cubbywolf> okay it kinda is
[1:19:49] <DSD24> He could always use both too
[1:19:49] <RickyRelucent> or just as a main option too
[1:19:49] <ALvl78Zapdos> really gonna do this whole playthrough with a claymore and a boar head lfg
[1:19:53] <%Josef_Stryker> CLAYMORE
[1:19:56] <Johannen> @pennykettle_ That shit is GOLD
[1:19:57] <subjectg> @ozzrabbit don’t think woolie knows the astora sword is divine
[1:19:57] <+Shishi1205> you can put both inj your right hand then deal the killing blow with the claymore
[1:19:58] <+Lordgale119> I literally just said "inb4 the build changes" when posting the art too lmao
[1:20:00] <Estuko> @JoshWithASpoon the 2x4 technology the KND can make with it.
[1:20:10] <%Seancicle> contexte manquant
[1:20:11] <Ros_Bef> I really want to see Reggie spare patches when he sees him but I know the bloodlust is too strong
[1:20:11] <%Solidnick18> bloody good time
[1:20:16] <%pupil31> LUL
[1:20:18] <DSD24> Yes you CAN
[1:20:18] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:20:19] <+セビー> woolie researched all fai weapons on his personal playthru
[1:20:19] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL LUL VoteYea
[1:20:20] <+cubbywolf> huh? *stabed&
[1:20:22] <RickyRelucent> Balder Knight: Nani?
[1:20:22] <+pectusumbra> reggie could poke his head in the funhouse for souls
[1:20:26] <Zineta> Reggie is feeling himself too hard LUL
[1:20:26] <Visorak6> But what if theyre wearing a BRING ON THE FIGHTS jacket?
[1:20:27] <+cubbywolf> WHAT ARE YOU GUNNA DO? STAB ME?
[1:20:28] <AbnormalVoid> you have to yell so he knows you're there
[1:20:29] <%Josef_Stryker> inb4 he gets the BSS
[1:20:31] <brunoberserk> HUZZAH
[1:20:35] <+セビー> whether he knows astora is divine tho.. eh
[1:20:38] <%Deekman> I had to step out for 30min, where are we heading?
[1:20:40] <+Jiggisnipe> Yelling it makes him know tho
[1:20:42] <Sargonyx> Who else wants some of Deebo!?
[1:20:45] <%jinking79> Daredevil Meme LUL
[1:20:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @josef_stryker I will shit if he does
[1:20:46] <DSD24> @Deekman Catacombs
[1:20:46] <iamnuff> BSS is a great sword
[1:20:46] <%pupil31> HERE WE GO
[1:20:48] <elshadow7> You could probably take down hellkite relatively easy with that damage
[1:20:48] <+Shishi1205> @Deekman skeletons
[1:20:49] <%Solidnick18> just minding my business
[1:20:53] <Zomner> real shit

[1:21:04] <DSD24> Bone Zone
[1:21:05] <%Deekman> thanks all
[1:21:12] <%mr_sups> The people who shows up at restaurants protesting mask mandates
[1:21:13] <RickyRelucent> We could just make this an EZ pinwheel run, but where is the fun in that
[1:21:14] <KeiganOfAstora> Yo, just got here after work. What did I miss? What did Reggie accomplish?
[1:21:17] <pepinillomaton> poor claymore
[1:21:27] <RickyRelucent> lets watch him stumbl around in the dark for a couple of hours
[1:21:35] <RickyRelucent> and then run  into Vamos eventually
[1:21:36] <%hax_metatron> The white circle is what you're looking for
[1:21:41] <+セビー> again, as ppl said, he can always revert it later
[1:21:42] <%hax_metatron> The numbers are irrelevant
[1:21:46] <elshadow7> @KeiganOfAstora Met Frampt, jumped down it's pit and died. Working on a divine claymore for catacombs right now
[1:21:46] <iamnuff> and 110 holy damage at the bottom
[1:21:47] <+Shishi1205> Faith is magic huh who would have thought
[1:21:53] <teh_Question> holy sword tyme
[1:21:56] <LVL1_Scumbag> The holy blade!

Many thanks! TwitchUnity
[1:22:02] <KeiganOfAstora> @elshadow7 Literally the same as the LP LUL
[1:22:02] <RickyRelucent> h o l y
[1:22:04] <+furtive0ne> So much suffering through bone town… but hey super hype boss fig… yeah…
[1:22:07] <legion0047> more numbers but you also have to push through 2 defense numbers
[1:22:12] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You could feed Frampt colored stones to get some green shards for upgrading at the bonfire
[1:22:13] <kjb343> A S C E N D E D
[1:22:16] <KeiganOfAstora> So did Reggie get to the end of Catacombs or no?
[1:22:18] <elshadow7> @KeiganOfAstora Yeap...of his own volition however this time around
[1:22:29] <+Shishi1205> Does he have coloured chunks?
[1:22:32] <SarcFa> @KeiganOfAstora just the very first room
[1:22:35] <+セビー> @keiganofastora he got to the first reassembling skeles and got mobbed
[1:22:36] <%Deekman> Did he fall down the Frampt hole?
[1:22:40] <SarcFa> @KeiganOfAstora still has a lot to go
[1:22:44] <+Lordgale119> catacombs isn't high level anyway, this is gonna do him good enough
[1:22:46] <RickyRelucent> @Deekman yup
[1:22:47] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> TBF having any twinkling weapon +4 rn is busted
[1:22:47] <+セビー> @deekman yep
[1:22:51] <ALvl78Zapdos> @Deekman oh yeah
[1:22:57] <%Deekman> @RickyRelucent did he die or does it take you?
[1:23:01] <KeiganOfAstora> Okay, did Woolie explain how Divine works against the skeletons or is Reggie doing Divine just cuz he likes magic? Woolie better not spoil the fucking gimmick of The Catacombs
[1:23:03] <RickyRelucent> he died
[1:23:06] <+Shishi1205> The fast way
[1:23:10] <RickyRelucent> FamilyMan
[1:23:11] <iamnuff> I think I Divined a mace for this part. Or maybe it was a pick.
[1:23:15] <+Lordgale119> he did spoil it
[1:23:16] <+Shishi1205> Speedrun to robe men
[1:23:18] <+セビー> @keiganofastora he explained it
[1:23:19] <KeiganOfAstora> You shouldn't have told him about Divine weapons dude
[1:23:20] <ALvl78Zapdos> @KeiganOfAstora you just missed it
[1:23:22] <%Deekman> @RickyRelucent thanks, i couldn't remember if you could just go
[1:23:29] <%hax_metatron> Exactly, I just speedran in panic through the Catacombs when I played this game in 2012. I was fucking terrified LUL
[1:23:29] <KeiganOfAstora> That ruined all the fun of figuring it out for himself... boooo
[1:23:30] <iamnuff> I know it wasn't my usual weapon because that was alrady +10
[1:23:30] <Qsmash_> the catacombs ain't that bad regularly
[1:23:32] <+Shishi1205> @KeiganOfAstora he had already told him
[1:23:32] <NumbF4ke> Reggie got mobbed already
[1:23:33] <%diegobandzz> diegobandzz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Another month with the boys we up ! Also you guys got any ways for dealing with jumbies? Apparently my gfs house is haunted 🥴
[1:23:34] <@Solidus_113> blue/white/red chunk will give more green shards specifically
[1:23:36] <iacus_> it would take forever to figure out without spoilers tho
[1:23:38] <+pectusumbra> Chat, Andre literally mentioned it 5 minutes before Reggie went in relax
[1:23:41] <RickyRelucent> I kinda remember you could
[1:23:42] <%a_goth_pancake> gotta grab that reinforced club for the holy baseball bat.
[1:23:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> HOLY Lucerne
[1:23:43] <jumpyhugs> @KeiganOfAstora Andre literally told him already
[1:23:47] <KeiganOfAstora> I just got here @a_goth_pancake
[1:23:48] <hazeprojekt> he can just drop down elevator for shortcut to catacombs
[1:23:51] <%Deekman> thanks for the catch up chat :-)
[1:23:52] <+Lordgale119> he DID walk into the catacombs with his catchpole
[1:23:54] <RickyRelucent> And it'd just be him upsidedown
[1:23:56] <RickyRelucent> as usual
[1:23:57] <KeiganOfAstora> Oh, I didn't know Andre gives you that tip
[1:23:58] <Wyldesquirrel> A holy mace trivializes the skellie zones, turning them into the early game areas they were intended to be.
[1:24:00] <RickyRelucent> shrug
[1:24:01] <+Lordgale119> this is round 2
[1:24:04] <+セビー> Woolie explained divine when reggie found the ember, reggie just happened to remember this info
[1:24:05] <+Mendin> But what about the power of Anime
[1:24:05] <RushUnplugged> reggie already fought skeletons several episodes ago, there's nothing to spoil
[1:24:07] <SarcFa> @KeiganOfAstora mate Reggie backed off and went wasn't there something that perma kills them, he figured like 90 percent of it himself
[1:24:08] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Divine Club is also great
[1:24:10] <+furtive0ne> Yeah the game tells you about the skeletons mad early
[1:24:14] <DrkJP520> The power of Christ comepls you, skeleton warrior
[1:24:17] <+Shishi1205> Andre says go to the basin for some dank divine for catacombs
[1:24:22] <JetpackMcQuack> it's no pole
[1:24:25] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but woolie don't you wanna kill God?
[1:24:28] <%patriotrenegade> Whered that ego go Reggie?
[1:24:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> I mean, you ARE trying to slash bones LUL
[1:24:34] <%hax_metatron> and Reggie ... THIS is how the game brings you back to the table for a conversation. LUL
[1:24:35] <@Solidus_113> ^
[1:24:36] <RickyRelucent> These dont even respawn LUL
[1:24:38] <+Shishi1205> Correct
[1:24:38] <%X2Eliah> wow that damage suuucks
[1:24:38] <Johannen> That's why i suggested to get more green shards)
[1:24:38] <KeiganOfAstora> @SarcFa Good
[1:24:40] <RickyRelucent> FAX
[1:24:45] <@Solidus_113> slashing bones not as good as crushing them
[1:24:46] <Ros_Bef> Did not expect it to be that weak
[1:24:49] <GeoGio3> blunt weapon to the skull
[1:24:53] <DSD24> A real Catch 22 Pole
[1:24:56] <%DegenCat> DegenCat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Magnificent job with Quelaag, Reggie!  Loving the LP so far!
[1:25:03] <+セビー> it tanked the str and dex scaling, and he has no fai
[1:25:06] <ハクア> it's slash weapon against skellys, it's gonna be weak
[1:25:08] <RickyRelucent> It is that weak, but catacombs isn't actually all that
[1:25:10] <+セビー> so this is what we get
[1:25:14] <KeiganOfAstora> Get a better shield too
[1:25:14] <hazeprojekt> The game just to Reggie to sit at the childrens table for his ego
[1:25:16] <RickyRelucent> buncha skeletons, some wheel skeles
[1:25:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> Reggie was feeling himself and Tomb of Giants was like "Sit down, son, let's have a talk"
[1:25:18] <KeiganOfAstora> That shield has horrible stability
[1:25:21] <legion0047> use the spells you shelled out and skilled for
[1:25:22] <ALvl78Zapdos> bone zone round 2
[1:25:24] <ハクア> blessed weapons have no scaling here
[1:25:24] <%jepupu> Reggie sure likes his shield
[1:25:28] <RickyRelucent> hardest things is the black knight
[1:25:33] <RickyRelucent> and the tit demon
[1:25:37] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> he should switch to the Black Knight Shield
[1:25:38] <seydaq> could do damage with the halberd then kill with claymore
[1:25:39] <velgaduere> "wahhhh Reggie remembered something the game told him I wanted him to forget and suffer wahhhhh" doodStare

[1:26:51] <RickyRelucent> Claymore is amazing, good moveset combos easily into eachother
[1:26:51] <%Deekman> he could fist fight them for bonus damage

[1:27:15] <RickyRelucent> I like the r2's for twohanded, with or without lights
[1:27:22] <%holydeviant1> Most swords are about 50-60, higher is reserved for the ULTRA greatswords like... the greatsword
[1:27:25] <RickyRelucent> and i abuse the run/backstepp animations
[1:27:28] <RickyRelucent> as much i can
[1:27:38] <%hax_metatron> Or Peeve's legendary parry LUL where he parried into a giantdad outfit and riposted
[1:27:46] <iamnuff> What sort of magic is Reggie using? Did he give up on pyromancy?

[1:28:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL
[1:28:25] <SQDizzy> Superparries should be in every Souls game
[1:28:25] <+Knivesmilli0ns> woolieSMUG_SG
[1:28:25] <legion0047> shield, caeastus, free hand or scimitar
[1:28:31] <+durt_mcguirk> use the buckler for easier parry
[1:28:31] <RickyRelucent> don't even think twohanding does a little bit more dmg then onehanded ripostes
[1:28:33] <subjectg> hell you can parry with an ultragreatsword if you wante
[1:28:34] <RickyRelucent> anymore
[1:28:37] <%Dakuu75> @iamnuff well, I've seen him use the greaat soul arrow he has equiped but, I think he doesn't like it because its slow
[1:28:44] <haitakaa> or the darkshield
[1:28:45] <%Solidnick18> haha
[1:28:48] <didipackums1> Maybeeee just kill it lol
[1:28:48] <legion0047> or a katana
[1:28:54] <binocu__lars> reggie is gonna die trying to parry a skeleton at 30% health

[1:39:42] <%hax_metatron> The divine requirement is PRECISELY for this reason Woolie. It forces builds to gimp themselves for this area.

[1:39:53] <+cubbywolf> still alive
[1:39:54] <iamnuff> He's using a faith weapon with no scaling, so it's not suprising that he's struggling.

[1:40:35] <KeiganOfAstora> Did Woolie already do the DS3 skeleton song?
[1:40:37] <%jepupu> Reggie probably won't figure out on his own what the lantern bois do while he has a divine weapon

[2:16:08] <peachy996> Pancake'd
[2:16:08] <seydaq> yo reg, can i hold a dollar LUL
[2:16:10] <RubeTheRogue> Yakuza 0's Mr. Shakedown makes his debut in Dark Souls.
[2:16:11] <DSD24> Yo Woolie this pinball game is hype!
[2:16:12] <+セビー> reggie in the basement tourny
[2:16:13] <%holydeviant1> skeleton wheel cart, driven by a black knight
[2:16:14] <Vorga1339> if you ever see a centaur table play it
[2:16:14] <+RyTYoung> Rev it up!
[2:16:17] <+Bitscreed> The wheel skeletons of fate are turning
[2:16:24] <+cubbywolf> how many souls we lose?
[2:16:29] <+cubbywolf> oh we got em
[2:16:29] <Xaeveax> His focus is CRITICAL
[2:17:01] <%hax_metatron> They're a shield check
[2:17:05] <KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[2:17:06] <dundore77> The wheel skeleton turns and reggies come and pass
[2:17:08] <KeiganOfAstora> Get rolled
[2:17:08] <%holydeviant1> getting DANGEROUSLY close!
[2:17:09] <+vaderxyz1970> Better have that POISE
[2:17:14] <SoaringTrumpet> he's dealing with the bonewheels quite well really
[2:17:27] <RubeTheRogue> Atleast Reggie has a pretty good chance of getting the wheel shield at this rate.
[2:17:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Vibe Check Skeletons
[2:17:34] <fantom_flasch> honestly being able to r1 one shot them makes this so much less terrible
[2:17:43] <OldManDeckardCain> it's always about the kinks with reggie
[2:17:43] <subjectg> i think the ones in the painted world are in a much more advantageous position
[2:17:45] <+セビー> wheel shield, the true spin to win
[2:17:48] <brunoberserk> wheeled skeleton DADADA
[2:17:49] <KeiganOfAstora> Is Reggie's shield the fire defense or the magic defense one?
[2:17:55] <subjectg> magic defense
[2:18:00] <KeiganOfAstora> Yea, he needs to change that
[2:18:01] <+セビー> ariamis wheels can go diaf
[2:18:03] <tigerfang86> *sick guitar riffs again*
[2:18:07] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> You got the power, you got the might//get ready for battle, beat the black knight!
[2:18:08] <%holydeviant1> @subjectg The wheel skeletons in the Painted world feel like a horror movie encounter
[2:18:10] <+pectusumbra> might be time for a chaos fire ball
[2:18:10] <+Mendin> 170 a swing is solid as fuck on a BK
[2:18:11] <KeiganOfAstora> That shield is situational for magic encounters
[2:18:13] <%mr_sups> That Pole is doing work
[2:18:15] <KeiganOfAstora> Has lower stability
[2:18:24] <@Solidus_113> the golf swing
[2:18:28] <DrkJP520> I love that axe

[2:19:42] <+cubbywolf> big ol demons
[2:19:46] <derap41> God dammit Reggie gets all the good drops

[2:20:31] <subjectg> @remedyofrevenge quelaag and ceaseless
[2:20:35] <%Solidnick18> yep
[2:20:37] <tigerfang86> some MEATY SWINGS
[2:20:38] <available_line> They were originally silver knights who went to battle the abyss and their armor burned to black from demon flame.
[2:20:38] <cheapdoc> If you drop int
[2:20:40] <AbnormalVoid> you can FLING some fuckers
[2:20:44] <brunoberserk> the black knights have that BLACK GIFT Kappa
[2:20:45] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Nightmare/Azeroth shit
[2:20:46] <%hax_metatron> Launching enemies with that axe was the most fun I had on a run
[2:20:47] <TheRealGreaterGamer> BIG MEATY SWINGS
[2:20:51] <%holydeviant1> Closest you might get to Soul Calibur's Astaroth
[2:20:51] <didipackums1> Too much luck, not enough strength
[2:20:54] <PunkZedB> "you can have cool axe" "but int though"
[2:20:57] <+セビー> black knights also dont have bodies anymore.. i think?
[2:20:57] <AbnormalVoid> Send people into the goddamn stratosphere
[2:20:57] <RubeTheRogue> Genre shift straight to baseball, homerun some fools.
[2:21:08] <+cubbywolf> bad asses
[2:21:10] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> @available_line Omg I just realised that's why they don't have capes
[2:21:13] <Klefth> STR/INT is such a strange mix honestly
[2:21:20] <Klefth> In 1 particularly
[2:21:28] <AbnormalVoid> and YOU will find out
[2:21:28] <DrkJP520> I love doing the 2-handed R2 behind a door as invaders are coming. fucking launch them, and they don't know what the fuck
[2:21:30] <@Solidus_113> you can parry them easy too
[2:21:32] <available_line> @Kobi_Robi_Tobi whoa
[2:21:34] <subjectg> @klefth at least you’re compensated with the mlgs
[2:21:37] <+Grayhammatter> fuck around, and find out
[2:21:43] <+pectusumbra> @Klefth It can reward the MGS though
[2:21:53] <Klefth> True
[2:22:02] <Blank9> my favorite build was honestly just pure balance for most to do the abyss greatsword stuff
[2:22:03] <+Mendin> Yeah but how long into the game to get the MLGS which is like the only thing natively that supports that build other than the TCP
[2:22:08] <haitakaa> clap them cheeks
[2:22:08] <subjectg> I’d love to see reggarth use the moonlight
[2:22:16] <%holydeviant1> still no lantern :c
[2:22:24] <+Mendin> No he got the lantern two necros ago
[2:22:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:22:24] <%DegenCat> he got the lantern
[2:22:25] <+ThePich> @holydeviant1 already got it
[2:22:25] <available_line> @subjectg does he have the INT?
[2:22:26] <Klefth> Moonlight would be sick
[2:22:27] <+xyxlzyzm> no he got one

[2:46:36] <+Lordgale119> he didn't put any humanity into the fair lady
[2:46:36] <%holydeviant1> to be fair you get a REALLY FUCKING COOL SWORD
[2:46:37] <+ArtemisCroc> no woolie, it only works on ng+

[2:46:54] <haitakaa> levels up the sword
[2:46:59] <+Jiggisnipe> I think it was fixed now but it'll still tell people on NG about gravelord shit
[2:47:00] <rekinom> Only functioning in NG+ was a bug that was fixed in remaster, chat
[2:47:14] <+ArtemisCroc> @Jiggisnipe any player can invade gravelords
[2:47:16] <+Pinkiefan> Edgelord covenant

[2:48:07] <twoah> The disasters absolutely do not show up on ng. But you can still get “gravelorded” and invade the host
[2:48:12] <+Grayhammatter> that's real fucking nito
[2:48:13] <+ArtemisCroc> I've been gravelording for years on several characters in remastered so I know how it works lol

[2:59:38] <+cubbywolf> i bet itll be sekiro
[2:59:49] <+Bitscreed> Meanwhile, Pinwheel is doing his thing.
[2:59:51] <legion0047> up up up
[2:59:52] <+Shishi1205> Right? If you kill pinwheel mr patches goes away?
[3:00:06] <SethYuikora> what major bosses are downed so far?  Been blighttowning it yet?
[3:00:09] <+cubbywolf> patches escaped?
[3:00:13] <+Shishi1205> @SethYuikora yes
[3:00:19] <+Bitscreed> @Shishi1205 I'm pretty sure you have to kill Pinwheel to get to where Patches is.
[3:00:22] <+Shishi1205> queelag and discharge gone
[3:00:22] <seydaq> is it nininbyori or saninbyori, chat?
[3:00:24] <RickyRelucent> If you kill pinwheel, patches moves to tomb
[3:00:26] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 no
[3:00:27] <+Lordgale119> he oneshot kellogs
[3:00:29] <RickyRelucent> which makes zero difference
[3:00:33] <+Shishi1205> You meet him b4
[3:00:35] <RickyRelucent> as he'll still ask his question
[3:00:36] <+RyTYoung> So...we good with the crypt? Did we meet Wheel Dad?
[3:00:38] <agustorm123> Why not fight the boss?
[3:00:39] <+Lordgale119> it was awesome
[3:00:39] <RickyRelucent> if u didnt meet him yet
[3:00:41] <+セビー> actually, patches was there for plague post-o&s.. so he should be ready to grief reggie
[3:00:44] <+cubbywolf> ah
[3:00:45] <+Shishi1205> He trolls you with the bridge
[3:01:04] <subjectg> So before pinwheel, bets on what mask reggie gets? My bet’s on father
[3:01:05] <LunarRemix> Oh yeah he completely missed Patches didn't he
[3:01:14] <legion0047> MESSAGE
[3:01:15] <RickyRelucent> Kinda, it requires a jumppp
[3:01:15] <+cubbywolf> big brain wall time
[3:01:16] <legion0047> LADDER
[3:01:19] <+Shishi1205> father for the boys
[3:01:22] <LunarRemix> Considering his luck he'll somehow get all three
[3:01:24] <%Grimlockfly> he keeps running past the lader
[3:01:27] <+セビー> my money is on child

[3:01:36] <RickyRelucent> tbh
[3:01:37] <%vivaciouseff> @セビー did plague use master key to avoid Capra? iirc the clerics heading to the catacombs is what gets Patches to move
[3:01:39] <+cubbywolf> reggie blind to ladders
[3:01:56] <peachy996> to be fair these are good ladders
[3:01:58] <+セビー> @vivaciouseff he skipped depths and capra, yeah

[3:04:08] <%hax_metatron> Reggie has not activated this bridge. The ONLY way out nowis through the broken wall, which puts you down a path which takes you near the beginning of the zone.
[3:04:08] <RickyRelucent> the other is a drop
[3:04:09] <Scrapl> dont jump!!
[3:04:09] <+セビー> we can all agree mother mask would be disappointing
[3:04:17] <Zerfed> wrong spot guys
[3:04:18] <RickyRelucent> for patches
[3:04:21] <RickyRelucent> i think a bit lower
[3:04:22] <legion0047> thats not a jump

[3:12:08] <RickyRelucent> back to the first upper floor

[3:12:21] <LunarRemix> He has to pull the lever across the bridge
[3:12:22] <legion0047> the other we just used
[3:12:22] <+Pinkiefan> It took me an hour to get out of here my first playthrough because I came here too early and killed pinwheel. Had to look up how to leave.
[3:12:24] <RickyRelucent> and 10 statues
[3:12:30] <zhenthrim213> keep rolling rolling
[3:12:34] <Johannen> @Klefth Only in the remaster, you cant get stuck like this in the original cause you come back at the bonfire higher up

[3:12:54] <cheapdoc> ALL of the scimitars
[3:13:01] <gryffinp> I have no real evidence, but I believe that the intended design was that the player go kill pinwheel after ringing the first bell but before ringing the second
[3:13:05] <Klefth> @Johannen That's a weird goof
[3:13:24] <legion0047> and now the door is open

[3:24:15] <+Shishi1205> it works 100%
[3:24:17] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus They're one-time spawns, so they reappear if you save and load, until you actually kill them. There should be two in this hallway, so if you only got one, then there should be one more.
[3:24:17] <%cubbywolf> nice
[3:24:19] <%cubbywolf> wtf

[3:24:30] <slix3431> That is a glitch
[3:24:31] <+Pinkiefan> They’re supposed to be there already but they messed up the bugs’ despawning.
[3:24:32] <+pectusumbra> it actually matters to reggie since he wants twinkling

[3:25:04] <%ChoculaUltra> titanite is back on the menu, boys!
[3:25:06] <%Dakuu75> this is NOT cheating, in the slightest. they repop if you zone too
[3:25:07] <seydaq> twinkle sprinkle
[3:25:12] <%Lion_kun> Whoever bet Reggie would lose to Pinwheel, gimme your money now.
[3:25:14] <+Pinkiefan> Literally the only way to do it because they despawn too fast in a few areas.
[3:25:17] <%cubbywolf> after 3 statues, do you really need 5 more?
[3:25:27] <Demoli_PT> how far is reggie in?
[3:25:30] <Xaeveax> Never knew that
[3:25:32] <%mikeiskill> man we're still trying to get to pinwheel
[3:25:33] <slix3431> Also these statues foreshadow an enemy
[3:25:37] <%cubbywolf> he's pretty far
[3:25:50] <SethYuikora> @Demoli_PT Bells rang, apparently
[3:25:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1460530098050945027?s=20

[3:26:24] <RickyRelucent> the scythe down here is nice
[3:26:28] <+RyTYoung> The bells are rang, Woolie said to Reggie that he could either go to Sen's or keep exploring out more
[3:26:37] <+セビー> @awesome_leaf nah, he didnt even do sens yet
[3:26:39] <RickyRelucent> its an actual scythe, the polearm also works for priscilla's tho
[3:26:41] <+pectusumbra> I mean he doesn't need it since he won't be dex
[3:26:43] <%Dakuu75> REEEEE~
[3:26:45] <Awesome_Leaf> oh interesting
[3:26:46] <+Pinkiefan> Lol, how does he avoid accidentally falling every time?
[3:26:51] <slix3431> It's the skulls from DOOM
[3:26:53] <subjectg> only thing left to grab is the great scythe
[3:27:02] <+Shishi1205> great scythe hype
[3:27:06] <Johannen> Now Reggie can +5 his Poke Pole and be 'UGE
[3:27:10] <legion0047> jump of one of the bridges to 100%

[3:27:20] <%cubbywolf> poke pole
[3:27:22] <+RyTYoung> Let him find the great scythe plz KreyGasm
[3:27:27] <BlueEagle2395> any weapon is worth picking up for fun and reggie could even like it enough to make it an elemental weapon
[3:27:27] <agustorm123> Is he doing a 100% run?
[3:27:28] <%cubbywolf> the camera is so shit in this area
[3:27:33] <seydaq> is there a link between thr skulls and cleric miracles?

[3:28:25] <brunoberserk> plague's favorite weapon ,right ?
[3:28:26] <Xaeveax> That wheat won't know what hit it
[3:28:28] <slix3431> It's the best
[3:28:32] <%cubbywolf> maths
[3:28:34] <+Mendin> @cubbywolf This one doesn't have the sweetspot mechanic that later ones do, it's actually ez
[3:28:35] <seydaq> enbSun
[3:28:36] <RickyRelucent> S scaling
[3:28:36] <Laironx3> farmers only
[3:28:36] <PunkZedB> dex though
[3:28:36] <subjectg> The reason why it’s good is because of the deadangles on this thing
[3:28:40] <+SilverDevilfish> ENB approved
[3:28:40] <RickyRelucent> when upgraded
[3:28:41] <zhenthrim213> its the best weapon in the game
[3:28:42] <SethYuikora> DeePS
[3:28:43] <slix3431> PEASANT COMING THROUGH
[3:28:44] <shotgang86> that R2 is DISGUSTING
[3:28:46] <%cubbywolf> @Mendin oh i didnt know that
[3:28:47] <ncr7wms3r22b7n3> cuz kurt angle KNOWS
[3:28:50] <+Shishi1205> running r1 is godly
[3:28:55] <ExpressNode> They're pretty deep
[3:28:55] <+セビー> great weapon, plague hates it
[3:28:56] <BlackermanZX> Farmer Souls kolFARMERS
[3:28:59] <RickyRelucent> I love the running attacks for it
[3:29:02] <RickyRelucent> ^^
[3:29:03] <hatios1> It looks so fragile
[3:29:03] <lotharrio> Good overhead.
[3:29:04] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus running r1
[3:29:05] <+xyxlzyzm> the backstab anim is HILARIOUS
[3:29:06] <%DegenCat> @slix3431 GOOD WEATHER 4 CROPS

[3:29:07] <wqorst> but can you use with your shield up?
[3:29:07] <JetpackMcQuack> reap
[3:29:08] <%cubbywolf> time to farm some souls
[3:29:09] <%Bread_Assassin> Probably the best weapon altogether, too.
[3:29:10] <sneakking131> spiicy
[3:29:11] <shotgang86> that R2 is good
[3:29:12] <RickyRelucent> the running and backstep animations for attacks
[3:29:12] <seydaq> dead angles blocks too
[3:29:12] <+Shishi1205> double handed

[3:29:16] <@Solidus_113> 2H R2 kills all
[3:29:20] <slix3431> @DegenCat BETCHU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT!
[3:29:21] <legion0047> also sweet spot
[3:29:21] <%cubbywolf> its no poke pole
[3:29:21] <SethYuikora> choppy-slicey
[3:29:21] <linSP> Standing attack’s are ok, back dash and running attacks slay
[3:29:21] <shotgang86> mash R2
[3:29:25] <RickyRelucent> some jumping punch shit, but with a scythe
[3:29:26] <+Bitscreed> Long boi.

[3:44:26] <teh_Question> woolie what are you talking about it's totes fine who hasn't dabbled in necromancy
[3:44:26] <%Feralspirit41> Interesting fact; the whispering in the music is thought to be the father apologizing for what he had done and other mad ramblings
[3:44:27] <fantom_flasch> was that a first try?
[3:44:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Family... family... family...
[3:44:32] <%starplatinumround> starplatinumround subscribed with Prime. 
[3:44:34] <+Bitscreed> "That's fucked-up and horrible" pretty much sums up most of the Dark Souls series.

[3:44:51] <fantom_flasch> how many hits did pinwheel take?
[3:44:57] <fantom_flasch> like 4?
[3:44:58] <agustorm123> like 5
[3:45:00] <jumpyhugs> and then for some reason there's a pit with like 8 of them later
[3:45:01] <subjectg> but few would practice it now that the mage’s guild has banned it
[3:45:01] <tomo_vendor> @Shishi1205 what the hell thats super cool
[3:45:02] <woweeezoweee> he full metal alchamisted it real bad it sounds like
[3:45:03] <RickyRelucent> He's fun if you summon friends
[3:45:05] <+Pinkiefan> Cruel story, bro.
[3:45:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> mah waif
[3:45:08] <Xaeveax> To be fair, lore-wise it wouldn't make sense for Pinwheel to be strong.
[3:45:11] <RickyRelucent> he takes a bit of punishment
[3:45:12] <Dopamien> @subjectg WutFace
[3:45:16] <RickyRelucent> and summons hes clones faster

[3:45:46] <Johannen> @PunkZedB Who?

[3:50:28] <LunarRemix> It works because it doesn't let him generate another bloodstain
[3:50:30] <OblivionSword1> does it works for that ?
[3:50:31] <royb2> they also sustain the bloodstain
[3:50:31] <BigYanno> it does, it's really cool
[3:50:32] <+ElDragon_1> It works
[3:50:33] <+Shishi1205> you avoid losing them yeah
[3:50:34] <%hax_metatron> Put the ring on, it works!
[3:50:34] <%mikeiskill> 16k isn't even 2 levels for him
[3:50:35] <theamazingaesoup> it works
[3:50:36] <legion0047> only works when on body
[3:50:39] <legion0047> not on ground
[3:50:46] <+xyxlzyzm> personally i wouldn't bother
[3:50:51] <subjectg> @deewtssob the uh huh girls were like UHUHUHHH
[3:50:51] <+Pinkiefan> The real trap is thinking the wheels won’t immediately kill you again.
[3:50:53] <%Deekman> put it on closer to
[3:50:55] <%vivaciouseff> @legion0047 i think it actually saves ground souls too
[3:50:56] <+セビー> nah, ring of sacrifice is fine for getting bloodstain
[3:50:56] <JetpackMcQuack> we're not dropping any more souls anyway
[3:50:57] <@Solidus_113> it's fiiiiiiinee
[3:50:57] <+BignanasTheGawd> I’d just bone home
[3:50:58] <+Shishi1205> you get a second chance
[3:51:00] <woweeezoweee> good call boys
[3:51:01] <%holydeviant1> clempsShame
[3:51:01] <+Malysitos> It doesn’t save the corpse run, don’t put on the ring
[3:51:01] <pepinillomaton> not worth for 16k
[3:51:01] <%Rafraud> Its not alot but its an important lesson
[3:51:06] <%counterfeitgimmicks> in the long run 16k is nothing
[3:51:09] <LunarRemix> Yes it works. It doesn't generate a bloodstain on death
[3:51:09] <%Rafraud> So let him get it out of his system
[3:51:10] <QueequegTheater> @Malysitos Yes it does
[3:51:10] <%hax_metatron> REGGIE KINDLE
[3:51:10] <RickyRelucent> No, it will let u KEEP the souls
[3:51:11] <shotgang86> and then he dies with 0 souls
[3:51:11] <%hax_metatron> KINDLE
[3:51:12] <gryffinp> Hot take: forget the souls. its like two levels at most?
[3:51:13] <RickyRelucent> INCASE u die
[3:51:13] <+セビー> i use sacrifice on bloodstain runs all the time
[3:51:14] <OblivionSword1> well might as well try
[3:51:14] <%Deekman> 1 level
[3:51:17] <shotgang86> and the ring
[3:51:19] <RickyRelucent> but he already died
[3:51:23] <RickyRelucent> hes about to lose the ring
[3:51:25] <RickyRelucent> and his souls
[3:51:26] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can get 2 more from the crow for humanity if you want
[3:51:27] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp consume
[3:51:27] <%Rafraud> Let him try chat shh
[3:51:29] <yukichocomilk> not how it works LUL
[3:51:29] <+Pinkiefan> True, 16k is tiny later.
[3:51:30] <%Rafraud> He obs mad
[3:51:31] <+HelloImTom08> those rings are a crutch
[3:51:33] <seydaq> take it nice and slow. this area will ko you
[3:51:38] <legion0047> don't drop
[3:51:39] <BoxFaceStar> oh boy, what'd i MISS... air is TENSE
[3:51:39] <Dopamien> @RickyRelucent you dont lose the souls, you lose the ring tho
[3:51:42] <legion0047> too high chance to fuck up
[3:51:42] <%hax_metatron> Take the right here into this tunnel and drop innto the blacksmith Bonfire @WoolieVersus
[3:51:44] <QueequegTheater> @RickyRelucent No. The ring prevents the bloodstain from disappearing
[3:51:48] <nxflre> vamos is near
[3:51:50] <subjectg> I would drop to vamos
[3:51:51] <NumbF4ke> Spiral is prob safer
[3:51:52] <%hax_metatron> Take the right into the tunnel and drop into blacksmith
[3:51:52] <RickyRelucent> @Dopamien alright bet woolieYE woolieYE
[3:51:57] <+Pinkiefan> Did be trade humanity to the crow for one yet?
[3:52:09] <+xyxlzyzm> @BoxFaceStar killed pinwheel, then died to skeleton wheels and dropped 16k souls, people are shitting themselves over it
[3:52:22] <Johannen> @Pinkiefan Nope, already mentioned it
[3:52:26] <BoxFaceStar> ohhhh boy
[3:52:28] <pepinillomaton> the drop to vamos is the thing that kills me the most in this area
[3:52:34] <subjectg> this is gonna go poorly,  i can feel it
[3:52:41] <+Mendin> Did Reggie ever buy Fall Control?
[3:52:48] <nxflre> Max aalso holds onto a lot of souls then losees em
[3:52:50] <+Pinkiefan> I start out every playthrough by trading that first humanity for a ring. @johannen ah, I see.
[3:52:52] <+Mendin> Cause that seems like a good utility sorcery to keep on hand for times like this
[3:52:55] <@Solidus_113> most of the time you want to roll onto the vamos platforms, the gravity sucks in DS1
[3:52:59] <JetpackMcQuack> SourPls
[3:53:02] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Fall Control sorcery sure would be helpfull right now)
[3:53:16] <CrowbarFacelift> oh god
[3:53:18] <Blank9> fall control doesn't help much
[3:53:29] <Blank9> you still instadie, just the damaging falls don't damage
[3:53:33] <+0neReeler> stakes are on the line
[3:53:34] <+セビー> Sorceries dont help against death floors
[3:53:37] <+Pinkiefan> Which DS game has the worst platforming, chat?  I’ve only played DS1.  Does it get worse?
[3:53:38] <seydaq> no cat ring here
[3:53:43] <KeiganOfAstora> I feel like we've been in Catacombs for hours
[3:53:45] <+Shishi1205> ideath drops cant bea voided
[3:53:48] <+セビー> Ds2 is wat
[3:53:53] <%pupil31> that's a lot of souls
[3:53:54] <royb2> no more smug reggie PogChamp
[3:53:55] <%Finnmac5> @KeiganOfAstora We have lmao
[3:53:55] <seydaq> Ego Breaker
[3:54:00] <+セビー> DS2 is way worse with platforming*
[3:54:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1460530098050945027?s=20
[3:54:01] <subjectg> i’d say ds1 is the worst one because there was no L3 jump in vanilla
[3:54:03] <+AlucardX60> @Pinkiefan DS2
[3:54:04] <pepinillomaton> @pinkiefan ds2 for me
[3:54:05] <nxflre> Did he forget about homeward bonees?
[3:54:06] <%BinaryFireball> fuck it just run it
[3:54:10] <subjectg> DS2 is manageable
[3:54:11] <+0neReeler> it will feel great a few minutes after you lose them all LUL
[3:54:12] <Johannen> I used it to drop into Vamos on my own, so helped me there)
[3:54:15] <%BinaryFireball> you can do it, just run it
[3:54:18] <Make_me_mad> Circle jump is easier than L3 jump.
[3:54:18] <+セビー> fall damage in 2 makes the majula lit SUCK
[3:54:21] <CrowbarFacelift> Why risk the drop
[3:54:25] <RickyRelucent> He's lvl 42 tryying to enter tomb again without any light options
[3:54:31] <+AlucardX60> The problem with DS2's platforming is that is actually wants you to use it.
[3:54:32] <RickyRelucent> this is literally the best it will ever be
[3:54:33] <%pupil31> monkaS
[3:54:40] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[3:54:43] <+Pinkiefan> I’ve been told to skip DS2 and come back to it after beating Bloodborne and DS3.

[4:23:58] <%jinking79> Reggie treated Patches like Minh when they begged him LUL

[4:24:00] <+mechslayer71> 3 more games of this shit OMEGALUL
[4:24:02] <%Rafraud> yes
[4:24:03] <%Josef_Stryker> No works too
[4:24:03] <Allen_33> the backstabber
[4:24:04] <AbnormalVoid> Jolly Undead Outcasts :)
[4:24:05] <gryffinp> The rule of patches is that you should always tell him you're mad and you don't forgive him, but don't actually attack him
[4:24:05] <Renegadorade> ggs shake my hand
[4:24:05] <peachy996> You can change him Reggie
[4:24:06] <RickyRelucent> welp, gonna be fun watching him go back up

[4:24:18] <@Solidus_113> Lautrec betrayed you, and he hated patches
[4:24:18] <justcallmebobplease> Say no, get item!
[4:24:19] <%hax_metatron> I don't get what the big deal with the Patches bamboozle is, he ALWAYS kicks you down to actual treasure, and ALWAYS is a useful merchant.
[4:24:25] <GeoGio3> he hates lautrec tho
[4:24:26] <nxflre> @RickyRelucent thursday probably
[4:24:26] <seydaq> select what you want Reggie
[4:24:29] <Cherokia666> He apologize and I think he meant it
[4:24:30] <slackerunchained> P.S. it's his way to apologize with gifts to make it at least somewhat worthwhile to forgive him.
[4:24:31] <RickyRelucent> Were all strangers in this life
[4:24:32] <justcallmebobplease> NO is indeed the answer
[4:24:40] <RickyRelucent> one can't even truely know ourselves
[4:24:40] <justcallmebobplease> Woolie's wrong - it's no gives an item.
[4:24:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> Say No
[4:24:48] <justcallmebobplease> Either answer is fine, but only No gives an item
[4:24:49] <slackerunchained> Yeah. Say no
[4:24:49] <legion0047> DO YOU LIKE HIM
[4:24:49] <%Deekman> Say no
[4:24:50] <RickyRelucent> free humanity
[4:24:53] <RickyRelucent> if u forgive
[4:24:54] <%Josef_Stryker> Either one works, No just gives u an extra item
[4:24:58] <RickyRelucent> also, he turns into a shop
[4:24:58] <Seydural> Patches will return....in Elden Ring
[4:24:58] <BigYanno> both forgive him
[4:25:00] <haitakaa> say no then just attack him if you want
[4:25:01] <RickyRelucent> after nito

[4:25:08] <fluffyesttail> Hugh manity

[4:25:12] <Johannen> No gives an item
[4:25:12] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus "Not forgive" isn't the same thing as "kill." He won't turn hostile here no matter what.
[4:25:16] <justcallmebobplease> NO GIVES ITEM

[4:32:16] <%cubbywolf> the detargeting LUL
[4:32:17] <%Fefe41> This is the path that Reggarth has chosen

[4:32:24] <yeildingthought> @kellbeii he is perfectly capable
[4:32:25] <ハクア> kobe...
[4:32:25] <noxeturna> I think it's more that communication isn't being clear enough. Reggie is trying to say "Give me the answer" and Woolie doesn't pick up on that fast enough, so he continues to be vague
[4:32:30] <seydaq> 1 shots evan at lv1 @woolieversus
[4:32:32] <+セビー> can handle the zone until he hits the orange fog

[4:33:50] <+pectusumbra> YEaaahh instantly
[4:33:56] <BigYanno> that's like 30 seconds of farming at the halfway point
[4:33:56] <%WerdIce> Good thing Reggarth found the perfect grave to die in LUL
[4:34:06] <dundore77> thats a miracle
[4:34:10] <+pectusumbra> but needs talisman
[4:34:11] <%cubbywolf> the deeper we dig the more horrors we find
[4:34:11] <Zerfed> you cant use that
[4:34:12] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus He does
[4:34:13] <+Shishi1205> talisman
[4:34:15] <Jerp> Reggie is doing pretty well for his first time here. my first playthrough was a disaster
[4:34:16] <AbnormalVoid> it's a miracle
[4:34:21] <AbnormalVoid> it's 2 Casts
[4:34:25] <seydaq> 40 more like 2

[4:35:26] <Dopamien> yea 40 = 2

[4:35:28] <seydaq> @fetrigon LUL yup
[4:35:30] <BettyMwwaahh> you should be able to HOLD it for a longer cast
[4:35:31] <pepinillomaton> needs more int LUL
[4:35:32] <buerdo> Velka’s talisman is int
[4:35:32] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus There sure is
[4:35:37] <+AlucardX60> It can be interrupted before you cast the full 20.
[4:35:37] <%hax_metatron> No it did 20 because he held it down
[4:35:39] <legion0047> and now we are back to full pyromancy
[4:35:42] <OblivionSword1> how is the damage for that btw ?
[4:35:46] <%hax_metatron> You don't have to have it expense all 20
[4:35:52] <%WerdIce> Don't think it even makes 20 swords
[4:35:59] <LunarRemix> He can cast it with the Velka Talisman since it scales off inteligence @WoolieVersus
[4:36:00] <Johannen> @A_German_spy Could he used Velka's one for that?
[4:36:02] <+セビー> wouldnt velkas be perfect for him to use grave swords?
[4:36:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:36:11] <scarman125> I'm surprised those are the only pyromancies he has.

[4:36:27] <Deko_> hall wug
[4:36:33] <seydaq> would've preferred the boss version of that spell
[4:36:35] <RickyRelucent> velka's goes soff int, but it still needs the faith
[4:36:38] <+0neReeler> its super effective

[4:38:10] <%Solidnick18> They will clap your cheeks
[4:38:10] <huskarl_zap> Where the hbk with the sweet chin music?
[4:38:11] <LoreKeeper_Thal> this was my wall in this game
[4:38:12] <Treasure_Vault> Woolie just tell him
[4:38:14] <glass_marcus> and they never stop being real
[4:38:15] <+megaman_sentinel> he not ready for this zone
[4:38:18] <QueequegTheater> After a dozen playthroughs, you forget what it's like to be non-optimal.  They're so fucking real.
[4:38:19] <cheapdoc> Combust these nutz
[4:38:26] <Darren716> Is Woolie gonna tell him progress is impossible?
[4:38:27] <twoah> Nanananana it’s do D O double G
[4:38:29] <Treasure_Vault> Get out of the deep zone and go to water polo lessons
[4:38:30] <%hax_metatron> He's not going to have fun brute forcing this, I promise you. This area is a bastard.
[4:38:34] <peachy996> Stay the course Woolie

[4:38:43] <420moneymoney69> Reggie wouldn’t listen anyways
[4:38:44] <SarcFa> why do people want to stop the fun suffering?
[4:38:44] <+kevlarkoala> @Treasure_Vault even when you're "supposed" to be here, this area sucks and those enemies will fuck you up
[4:38:45] <buerdo> Has reggie fought o&s?
[4:38:45] <+Shishi1205> this area sucks without long range
[4:38:47] <Darren716> Legit fuck the tomb without the maggot
[4:38:48] <RickyRelucent> @QueequegTheater feels weird not just coming down here to farm humanityy of babby skeles
[4:38:49] <Zerfed> Reggie is tough he can handle it
[4:38:49] <+0neReeler> ez grinding area
[4:38:51] <seydaq> only needed 2 out of 5 hits to ko you
[4:38:55] <oneimportantthing> Even if Woolie tells him to stop it will only motivate Reggie harder
[4:38:56] <huskarl_zap> @cheapdoc cum bust these nuts

[4:39:34] <oak120> bold of you to assume that 20k is getting out of here
[4:39:34] <+Malysitos> Hey, you can buy the Crest of Astorias now
[4:39:35] <RickyRelucent> @Kobi_Robi_Tobi Nope, he sat down at the bonfire
[4:39:35] <Treasure_Vault> LUL
[4:39:38] <gryffinp> I was hoping woolie had decided to let reggie get all the way to the piss filter
[4:39:39] <+Shishi1205> nah thats going into a level
[4:39:40] <seydaq> enbRespect
[4:39:40] <+セビー> silver serpent’s drop sucks offline, i bet theres a comment to land on
[4:39:40] <BigYanno> this feels like a tactical backdown! I hope so

[4:39:40] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus There is one good item off that ledge with the skeleton archer)
[4:39:40] <RickyRelucent> can't boner out
[4:39:44] <pepinillomaton> good luck
[4:39:45] <oda_flobunaga> NOOOOOOOO
[4:39:47] <Darren716> For real though, Woolie should have him railroad to the vessel
[4:39:47] <scarman125> honestly save the crest of artorias until after the DLC in my opinion
[4:39:48] <BigYanno> now the question is HOW
[4:39:55] <%cubbywolf> bone her? I hardly know her
[4:39:59] <%hax_metatron> Not ther
[4:40:01] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[4:40:05] <RickyRelucent> You go to the hole where u come oiut of patche's pit
[4:40:08] <OblivionSword1> now how do we get out of here
[4:40:10] <RickyRelucent> then u turn left at the exit
[4:40:10] <QueequegTheater> @scarman125 that means no Kaathe tho
[4:40:10] <+Shishi1205> he has to drop into the skellie fight pit
[4:40:13] <BigYanno> well the answer isn't going to be DOWN reggie
[4:40:14] <RickyRelucent> then u go back up
[4:40:17] <legion0047> there is stiff down there
[4:40:19] <+BignanasTheGawd> 20k souls, just enough to drop kick a dog
[4:40:19] <%Fefe41> I forgot how gigantic those arrows are lol
[4:40:22] <twoah> Time to buy Artorias’s crust
[4:40:23] <brunoberserk> backwards tomb of giants AND catacombs gonna be ROUGH , good luck , reggie Kappa
[4:40:23] <Darren716> You gotta get up to get down
[4:40:24] <legion0047> but to go back, you continue along the wall
[4:40:29] <RickyRelucent> found it
[4:40:30] <RickyRelucent> we here
[4:40:33] <RickyRelucent> this is it
[4:40:37] <RickyRelucent> upper

[4:40:46] <RickyRelucent> so close
[4:40:48] <Dopamien> calebKek
[4:40:48] <%cubbywolf> reggie really wants to go down
[4:40:48] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> uppmost
[4:40:51] <RubeTheRogue> Yes Reggie, crawl back into the pit
[4:40:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> there is NO way he makes it to the crest lmao
[4:41:00] <+Shishi1205> no way he makes it
[4:41:00] <pepinillomaton> woolie directed him back
[4:41:02] <Crownaux0> might as well clear out the area up until the brilliant fog wall
[4:41:05] <RickyRelucent> yup
[4:41:07] <+Malysitos> Reggie really likes that pit
[4:41:08] <RickyRelucent> we hjere
[4:41:09] <%strakillias> I had dip out for a bit, how'd Reggie do on Pinwheel?
[4:41:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I believe in Reggie
[4:41:11] <seydaq> admire the gumption
[4:41:15] <RickyRelucent> left
[4:41:17] <RickyRelucent> left of this hole
[4:41:20] <RickyRelucent> noooo
[4:41:20] <LunarRemix> That hole has some good stuff in there though
[4:41:21] <oak120> @strakillias he did not shame himself
[4:41:21] <RickyRelucent> wait
[4:41:23] <+BignanasTheGawd> Who’s trying to bet he makes it out with 20k souls
[4:41:24] <%hax_metatron> LEFT
[4:41:24] <RickyRelucent> this is good too
[4:41:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @strakillias almost choked but one shot
[4:41:31] <RickyRelucent> he goes upto pinwheel's coffin
[4:41:32] <%hax_metatron> UP
[4:41:32] <+askalta> haha
[4:41:33] <%cubbywolf> woolie and chat getting reggie killed again
[4:41:33] <oda_flobunaga> in the hole, in the hole, in the hole in the hole
[4:41:36] <RickyRelucent> if he goes right
[4:41:37] <dundore77> @strakillias It took him a few moments but beat him in one try
[4:41:40] <+Jiggisnipe> on the rock?!

[4:42:07] <+studleydoorite> I don't think the arrow did that
[4:42:08] <pepinillomaton> He aint leaving
[4:42:08] <legion0047> no you did not
[4:42:09] <BigYanno> I'm curious does anyone in the woolieverse have a sense of direction?
[4:42:09] <Johannen> you got hit by everything)
[4:42:09] <+Shishi1205> it is right there
[4:42:10] <cheapdoc> You got hit by greed son

[4:42:24] <NumbF4ke> Fireballs FTW
[4:42:25] <RickyRelucent> reggie is in tombs at lvl 40 guyys

[4:42:34] <SarcFa> @peachy996 this, let Reggie feel the pain
[4:42:35] <royb2> He'll give up eventually dont worry
[4:42:36] <+Jiggisnipe> he needs to remember to switch to shield
[4:42:37] <%Fefe41> Tomb of giant despair
[4:42:39] <Johannen> He got the +5 pole he can do it
[4:42:41] <subjectg> this is a good bonfire to kindle anyway
[4:42:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> close
[4:42:57] <KeiganOfAstora> He's just gonna keep going and get further in and find the second bonfire. And we'll be back here next stream LUL
[4:42:57] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[4:43:00] <Deko_> thats bs LUL
[4:43:00] <%Visorak6> That was bullshit
[4:43:01] <%eyezehuhh> Perfect time to join
[4:43:03] <%Solidnick18> wtf
[4:43:03] <+Shady_Zaku> doodSad doodWat
[4:43:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:43:03] <AbnormalVoid> wasn't he gonna spend the souls?
[4:43:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Got the souls, tho
[4:43:05] <legion0047> lava didn't trigger
[4:43:06] <peachy996> At least you didn't lose the souls
[4:43:07] <+liquidzr0> LUL
[4:43:07] <+Shishi1205> this area is hard
[4:43:07] <%cubbywolf> did he get the souls?
[4:43:09] <RickyRelucent> first time in catacombs, went straight to tombs
[4:43:10] <subjectg> ! TILTED !
[4:43:11] <%eyezehuhh> Wha happun?
[4:43:12] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[4:43:12] <seydaq> this is oregon trail levels hoofin
[4:43:15] <RickyRelucent> and then he sat down at this bonfire
[4:43:16] <jaygee303> It’s fine he went down for this session but there’s a reason most people do this at the end
[4:43:16] <Zerfed> the tomb is teaching him
[4:43:18] <+Jiggisnipe> he got the souls
[4:43:19] <%cubbywolf> THIS IS WHAT YOU DID WOOLIE
[4:43:20] <KeiganOfAstora> Magic. Is. Slow.
[4:43:21] <Zerfed> the humility
[4:43:24] <RickyRelucent> he really did choose the bad ending
[4:43:28] <Slim_Lipid> this is true dark souls
[4:43:29] <cheapdoc> You escaped the depths and blightcon, now escape the tomb bro
[4:43:34] <RickyRelucent> AT LVL 40
[4:43:35] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[4:43:35] <pepinillomaton> Imagine if he made it to the orange gate for nothing....
[4:43:36] <KeiganOfAstora> Woolie, just remind Reggie that there are other places in the game he can go right now
[4:43:40] <DSD24> Right in the nads
[4:43:42] <cheapdoc> Get ready to dig up
[4:43:42] <%strakillias> @oak120 @cobalt_phoenix_ @dundore77 Hell yeah. Reggie is crushing it. Thanks guys
[4:43:44] <nxflre> Did heget to to gold fog wall?
[4:43:47] <+セビー> @keiganofastora he has
[4:43:54] <+Jiggisnipe> @KeiganOfAstora he's leaving
[4:43:54] <Johannen> @KeiganOfAstora Been said twice already
[4:43:54] <Dopamien> @nxflre no
[4:43:55] <KeiganOfAstora> NO FIRE
[4:44:00] <KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[4:44:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> Can't you hold the lantern on the right so he can block?
[4:44:07] <%cubbywolf> red is a nice scary color
[4:44:08] <nxflre> @Dopamien i see
[4:44:16] <%vivaciouseff> @nxflre decided to dip cause enemies are high level
[4:44:21] <jaygee303> Like you do this zone when the orange gate is over since it’s a dead end after this
[4:44:30] <KeiganOfAstora> Breath
[4:44:34] <+Shishi1205> good
[4:44:34] <KeiganOfAstora> Breathe*
[4:44:45] <KeiganOfAstora> goal?
[4:44:49] <nxflre> @nxflre ah yeah wonder why he decided to go down here when everything was poiinting to sens
[4:44:51] <RickyRelucent> level that endurence
[4:44:52] <+trackles_64> what does humanity do?
[4:44:52] <+Mendin> We're in the "Chat, CHILL" phase again. Going into the Tomb and getting stonewalled isn't the best content for everyone but it's an honest part of a first timer's playthrough development
[4:44:52] <royb2> PUMP THAT INT
[4:44:53] <RickyRelucent> ffs
[4:44:54] <RickyRelucent> christ
[4:44:56] <LunarRemix> Int also buffs your weapon
[4:44:57] <+Malysitos> Strong int man
[4:45:00] <noxeturna> Attunement is your biggest drawback in using both
[4:45:04] <brunoberserk> almost feels like he's gonna do a moonlight build LUL
[4:45:06] <Johannen> There are cooler spells coming up in the future
[4:45:06] <legion0047> then use magic
[4:45:06] <seydaq> int 50 LUL
[4:45:10] <420moneymoney69> Fuck it do resistance
[4:45:10] <noxeturna> You will need a LOT of SLOTS
[4:45:10] <OblivionSword1> pretty good picks I say
[4:45:18] <legion0047> until you get to the bullshit spells they allow you to plink away
[4:45:18] <RickyRelucent> reggie needs a greatshield
[4:45:22] <RickyRelucent> imo
[4:45:23] <+Malysitos> Strong int pyromancy man!
[4:45:24] <BigYanno> you need strength and int so you level vit?
[4:45:26] <pepinillomaton> Soul arrows are for show
[4:45:33] <KeiganOfAstora> If this was the LP, Pat would be telling Reggie that he needs to pick 2 out of 4 of those things LUL
[4:45:34] <peachy996> He's got the whole world in his hands! He's got the whole world in his hands!
[4:45:34] <legion0047> but you use them like they are instant KO
[4:45:37] <KeiganOfAstora> Can't be a jack of all trades
[4:45:38] <Dopamien> @nxflre I think it was to explore catacombs, but once he got to pinwheel he just felt the urge to go further. I did the same tbh
[4:45:39] <+BignanasTheGawd> Just wait till elden ring Reggie, then you can truly spell sword
[4:45:44] <+ArtemisCroc> you can also just switch between sorcery and pyro based on the situation you're walking into
[4:45:50] <+megaman_sentinel> 2hand it
[4:45:57] <pepinillomaton> na man just get out
[4:46:06] <RickyRelucent> @KeiganOfAstora You can, but its tricky
[4:46:14] <RickyRelucent> all the gimmicky sorcery is rly low lvl
[4:46:18] <RickyRelucent> vase magic, silence feet
[4:46:23] <420moneymoney69> Woolie explained a jack of all trades is a poor choice but he won’t listen
[4:46:34] <Treasure_Vault> Can you sprint up ladders in ds1?
[4:46:34] <royb2> @KeiganOfAstora Its not completely wrong. Its a good general guidance to pick 2 but you can go broader if you knwo what you are doing
[4:46:44] <Make_me_mad> I beat the game my first time with a jack of all trades build. It's not optimal but it's doable.
[4:46:44] <dundore77> let him level what he wants chat its seriously not a big deal
[4:46:47] <KeiganOfAstora> @royb2 Does he though? LUL
[4:46:58] <RickyRelucent> if u do go jack of all trades
[4:46:58] <royb2> He said he's gonna level strength and Int didnt he?
[4:47:05] <RickyRelucent> u wont be going 30+ faith and int
[4:47:06] <Make_me_mad> If someone had told me that I should drop the build I wanted to be more specialized I'd have just stopped playing the game.
[4:47:08] <legion0047> THEY ARE NOT DELETERS
[4:47:11] <RickyRelucent> depends
[4:47:12] <atlasdotwav> Is giant scimitar a player weapon?
[4:47:13] <KeiganOfAstora> But if he wants magic and pyro he needs Attunement too
[4:47:15] <+Jiggisnipe> yea he's str and int mainly
[4:47:17] <RickyRelucent> anything can happen with light armor
[4:47:19] <legion0047> unless they are the high end pure damage ines
[4:47:20] <SarcFa> one physical, one magic, and then health and stamina isn't a jack of all trades build
[4:47:47] <420moneymoney69> All his stats are almost the same lol
[4:47:48] <SarcFa> it's a bog standard spellsword build
[4:47:53] <dundore77> if it really ends up being a problem they can grind off screen to "fix" his build its not a problem let reggie play with what he wants
[4:47:57] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[4:47:59] <+pectusumbra> @SarcFa yeah, almost no one is going to skip vit or end.
[4:48:00] <noxeturna> Reggie, you stumbled into an area intended for a much higher level. You are doing well despite the odds stacked against you
[4:48:00] <NiniGiovanini> Reggie sounds so sad. Is he ok? Maybe it's time to stop.
[4:48:01] <+Shishi1205> 2 offensive stats is the usual
[4:48:02] <pepinillomaton> I mean the build will be good to use "the blade" guys
[4:48:04] <legion0047> except he never uses any of his spells
[4:48:06] <nxflre> @Dopamien ah well its gonna be fun going up lolol
[4:48:09] <%vVAstrAVv> spell builds are awesome unfortunately reggies missing some key peices from darkroot badin
[4:48:09] <RickyRelucent> @noxeturna
[4:48:11] <Johannen> I am loving this, not your by the book advised progression path is great
[4:48:20] <RickyRelucent> double the lvl
[4:48:21] <KeiganOfAstora> Darkroot Biden?
[4:48:21] <RickyRelucent> actually
[4:48:23] <RickyRelucent> easily.
[4:48:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @NiniGiovanini if he stops here he'd be even sadder
[4:48:26] <peachy996> ohhh
[4:48:27] <Estuko> FOOT
[4:48:28] <Blank9> 20 is good enough in any stat to beat the game
[4:48:33] <+Mendin> His main int spell was spellblade stuff but currently doesn't need it with the TCP
[4:48:33] <Explodincatz> keek
[4:48:34] <royb2> yeah its fun to see a different take
[4:48:35] <Blank9> without feeling bad
[4:48:36] <+Peterbyte_> what have i stumbled in on
[4:48:37] <atlasdotwav> You can beat the game with fists I'm sure he will be fine
[4:48:52] <+Jiggisnipe> yea he'll be able to beat the game with his build so no big deal
[4:48:58] <RickyRelucent> @blank 20 vit or end isn't nearly enough to do anyything
[4:49:03] <%KellBeII> hes going to get to sens and wonder why the game got so much easier
[4:49:04] <RickyRelucent> and 20 faith or int seems dinkyy
[4:49:04] <420moneymoney69> If you’re insanely good you can lol
[4:49:12] <+ArtemisCroc> int and str is a perfctly viable build, we're not doing meta level pvp here
[4:49:16] <RickyRelucent> 20 dex and str sounds good tho
[4:49:24] <RickyRelucent> few weapons to pick from
[4:49:30] <+Shishi1205> also why the hell did the balck knight only appear once below?
[4:49:31] <subjectg> as long as he gets the requirements for the mlgs he’s good
[4:49:33] <RickyRelucent> Wished he'd of stuck to the quality + hp and end
[4:49:34] <+Jiggisnipe> if people can beat this game at sl 1, then Reggie will be fine
[4:49:36] <RickyRelucent> welp
[4:49:41] <RickyRelucent> shiny magic :^)
[4:49:42] <glass_marcus> 20 vit is plenty
[4:49:44] <Estuko> #BelieveInReggie
[4:49:44] <+Jiggisnipe> he knows how to learn enemy patterns
[4:49:48] <SarcFa> he's still only in the forties levels, the build is fucking fine
[4:49:51] <LunarRemix> 20 is okay 30 is good
[4:49:56] <RickyRelucent> Lucky Reg!
[4:49:57] <KeiganOfAstora> But Reggie isn't people. Reggie is person
[4:49:58] <+ArtemisCroc> let the man have fun instead of being optimal first time lol
[4:50:03] <RickyRelucent> 40 is glorious
[4:50:06] <brunoberserk> is the NOPE zone
[4:50:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1460530098050945027?s=20
[4:50:07] <RickyRelucent> 50 is overkill
[4:50:12] <pepinillomaton> we out we out
[4:50:13] <Dabrikishaw> STR/INT can work, but Reggie will need a guide so he doesn't waste points trying to do everything
[4:50:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he made it!
[4:50:16] <Johannen> Hell yeah @ArtemisCroc my man
[4:50:18] <+swesterly> He is going to hit a literal wall soon
[4:50:22] <RickyRelucent> especially now the sunlight spears are at 40 now
[4:50:22] <%Fefe41> My first time here I saw the black void and noped out of there
[4:50:24] <420moneymoney69> Yeah if people that have put 100s of hours in the game can beat it at s1 I’m sure Reggie will be fine…..lol
[4:50:26] <+Jiggisnipe> @KeiganOfAstora Reggie also beat stray demon early, he's fine it's an action rpg, just learn the enemy patterns
[4:50:27] <pepinillomaton> he made it out
[4:50:28] <+swesterly> Oh whoops nvm
[4:50:33] <noxeturna> Pinwheel room POG
[4:50:36] <RickyRelucent> sunbros dont require 50 faith either anymore
[4:50:37] <seydaq> reggie has done incredibly well
[4:50:46] <Dopamien> str/int for buff nerd mlgs PogChamp
[4:50:53] <Make_me_mad> 'waste points' you can always just level up more. Or get a weapon that doesn't use scaling. Plenty of ways to win. And Reggie's good at this, so it'll be fine.
[4:50:56] <+RyTYoung> gtfooooo
[4:50:58] <RickyRelucent> reg could've gotten in at 5 faith, if he'd of been summoned 4 times
[4:51:00] <Wyldesquirrel> Reggie isnt going for a pvp soul level meta build- He can level as much as he needs to wasting points along the way, it dont matta
[4:51:04] <KeiganOfAstora> So close!!
[4:51:07] <+ArtemisCroc> ds1 is not so hard that you can't overcome it by improving, build be damned
[4:51:08] <+kevlarkoala> @Jiggisnipe i'd rather fight stray 5 times than do this area once
[4:51:11] <atlasdotwav> He's doing real damage two handed alreadi
[4:51:17] <+studleydoorite> Reggie is quite a chosen one, he will make a great candle
[4:51:17] <RickyRelucent> getting summoned lowers the faith requirement by 5
[4:51:26] <RickyRelucent> and the starting amount to join is 25
[4:51:26] <Dopamien> hey were back PogChamp kinda
[4:51:28] <justcallmebobplease> Wrong way
[4:51:28] <oak120> Caution serves him well
[4:51:30] <pepinillomaton> wrong way
[4:51:36] <+Shishi1205> wrong way
[4:51:37] <justcallmebobplease> Can't get out this way
[4:51:41] <legion0047> wrong way
[4:51:42] <subjectg> now just to climb up to the catacombs
[4:51:43] <%Rafraud> We buying the artorias seal?
[4:51:46] <+Peterbyte_> what mask did he get?
[4:51:47] <+liquidzr0> weong way
[4:51:49] <atlasdotwav> Oh F go back
[4:51:50] <legion0047> child
[4:51:51] <+Shishi1205> child
[4:51:51] <subjectg> Child
[4:51:54] <420moneymoney69> Nah you’re right, I guess I’m just annoyed that Woolie gives him advice and he just ignores it
[4:51:54] <RickyRelucent> he needed to go right at the six giant ground hole
[4:51:57] <+Pinkiefan> Did Woolie tell him this is just a big dead-end?
[4:52:01] <RickyRelucent> left of the exit hoel of patch pit
[4:52:06] <+Peterbyte_> rip giant dad
[4:52:06] <RickyRelucent> either or
[4:52:12] <+Shishi1205> watch him die to wheels
[4:52:14] <Johannen> @Pinkiefan That would not have been fun
[4:52:18] <BigYanno> I wish woolie would just correct him when he's going the wrong way rather than let him get all the way to the dead end before going "uh this is the wrong way"
[4:52:19] <atlasdotwav> Rest in RIP
[4:52:19] <Jerp> jerpWit
[4:52:19] <+Funkyfjord> is there one or two more bonfires down there? two right?
[4:52:22] <+Shishi1205> he can get one later
[4:52:24] <justcallmebobplease> @Shishi1205 Fingers crossed
[4:52:24] <DeathByPoke7> Giant MEMES
[4:52:26] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[4:52:26] <Dabrikishaw> There's nothing meta about any build, but Id hope Reggie doesn't get to the point where he thinks he needs to grind souls just because he wants to use most of the spells he finds instead of what works best for him
[4:52:27] <cheapdoc> Ya don't need light anymore
[4:52:28] <RickyRelucent> yup
[4:52:29] <double_zr_tap> 10 dex

[4:56:45] <peachy996> Are you having a good time?
[4:56:45] <+Pinkiefan> Learning the run.
[4:56:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> does he need a break tho?
[4:56:50] <%hax_metatron> I told y'all not to do this before Lordvessel
[4:56:51] <RickyRelucent> would've been safe if he just DID NOT
[4:56:51] <BlueEagle2395> NotLikeThis
[4:56:53] <%Rafraud> ! REGGIE AT RISK !
[4:56:54] <+kevlarkoala> @subjectg it's called tilt my guy, and it's dark souls. so they kind of go hand in hand
[4:56:54] <legion0047> Reggie is chasing the rabbit
[4:56:55] <RickyRelucent> SIT AT THIS BONFIRE
[4:57:01] <%livlinn> shiaUGH t101GANB t101ATTE
[4:57:04] <nxflre> @Rafraud shouldve done Sens lol
[4:57:06] <NiniGiovanini> let him take a break please
[4:57:06] <+Shishi1205> @RickyRelucent isn't the tp bonfire the vamos one?

[4:57:14] <+BignanasTheGawd> Tomb of Boom
[4:57:15] <seydaq> this is the "draw the rest of the damned owl" phase
[4:57:15] <Dabrikishaw> I did wonder what it felt like to see a new player get stuck in a area
[4:57:20] <Treasure_Vault> I'm split. One the one hand, we all sat here.
[4:57:22] <Dopamien> Kreygasm auhh
[4:57:23] <RickyRelucent> depends where he sat down last
[4:57:23] <Estuko> party part party, we're gonna have a party, party party party-
[4:57:25] <oneimportantthing> Reggie PLEASE come back to this later
[4:57:26] <%Rafraud> Oh I thought he did Sens already LOL
[4:57:28] <RickyRelucent> but either would've been better
[4:57:33] <mothdude> lmao
[4:57:37] <NiniGiovanini> like, normally, a person playing a DS game at home would take a break here
[4:57:40] <+robertoszek> +0 retrieval, feels good
[4:57:42] <+Shishi1205> there you go
[4:57:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ay he's got it
[4:57:48] <+Jiggisnipe> fireball switch swing kill
[4:57:50] <+セビー> so, imagine the reaction when woolie tells him everything after pinwheel was in vain..
[4:57:52] <subjectg> @kevlarkoala that’s why i said i understand being frustrated, but you can’t rush dark souls if you’re not that good, you gotta play by its rules, even if it takes some time
[4:57:55] <oak120> clean
[4:57:55] <Estuko> Nice work!
[4:57:57] <atlasdotwav> Most efficient method
[4:58:04] <%Rafraud> his spear has holy?

[4:59:34] <+andrew1ups> U can’t outrun destiny
[4:59:34] <+Malysitos> Now that was unfortunate
[4:59:36] <+robertoszek> running past the whellskeletons is like throwing a d20
[4:59:40] <+セビー> this is like the fourth time he has tried running the wheels
[4:59:42] <jaygee303> Just right
[4:59:45] <+studleydoorite> narrow pass -> chaos fireball as they come in
[4:59:46] <atlasdotwav> Veeeery hard to dodge
[4:59:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey he got the first part down tho so that's good
[4:59:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah you might just want to kill those bitches one at a time

[5:02:38] <karawra> now this is dark souls
[5:02:39] <agustorm123> is tuesday my dudes
[5:02:40] <%Visorak6> This is a LATE game area
[5:02:40] <DeathByPoke7> this is dark souls
[5:02:42] <+studleydoorite> this part sucks, especially without a better light source
[5:02:44] <NiniGiovanini> Woolie, hug him!
[5:02:47] <Awesome_Leaf> BRUTAL
[5:02:48] <SunsetJack> I am amazed you didn't do it in order...
[5:02:49] <wantedsafe471> where did they go? Tomb of giants?
[5:02:49] <Johannen> @TheOddJik It was mentioned that those enemies are some real ass shit mafckr
[5:02:50] <Awesome_Leaf> ty for the answer
[5:02:52] <seydaq> all the ingredients are there, reggie. its just execution and luck
[5:02:52] <Darren716> Did Cata give him much trouble?
[5:02:52] <oak120> Tomb of the Giants is just like this.
[5:02:53] <+andrew1ups> Cherry poppin
[5:02:53] <+0neReeler> the real dark souls starts here
[5:02:55] <resloxxx> remember the beginning of the stream LUL
[5:02:56] <theamazingaesoup> Cool down time
[5:02:56] <scarman125> he's WAY too early for this zone
[5:03:06] <atlasdotwav> This is more souls than anything else
[5:03:12] <RickyRelucent> imagine telling someone how to progress in a virgin run
[5:03:13] <+Malysitos> Now mind you, Reggie got here a bit too early
[5:03:14] <dsmastodon> No Reggie is way too special for this :D
[5:03:15] <RickyRelucent> only for the build
[5:03:15] <dmtjinni> what they talking about???
[5:03:17] <VincentGraves> you need to become humble
[5:03:20] <+Bitscreed> He's done pretty well considering how late-game a zone this is.
[5:03:20] <RickyRelucent> fuck what u want from the story
[5:03:21] <+Tuffty> Reggie you'll come back to this area later and be better for it, I promise
[5:03:21] <Darren716> ngl I'm curious if he'll have an easier time in Sens that tomb
[5:03:21] <+Shishi1205> skeletons kick your shit in
[5:03:23] <RickyRelucent> or the journey
[5:03:25] <Crownaux0> the getting out is the worst part, he did pretty good getting in
[5:03:26] <+SkitsofRandom> we've literally all been there
[5:03:29] <NiniGiovanini> he is literally in an end game zone right after Blighttown
[5:03:31] <cheapdoc> It doesn't have to be, but it is now
[5:03:35] <lotharrio> The DS2 equivalents are worse.
[5:03:37] <+robertoszek> doing blightown, catacombs and tomb of the giants back to back is rough
[5:03:39] <+andrew1ups> These little psych sessions after are gold
[5:03:42] <+xyxlzyzm> @WoolieVersus thank you for letting reggie experience the game naturally! getting lost is the most memorable part of your first playthrough and getting guided robs you of that!
[5:03:42] <RickyRelucent> journey will be what it is ^^
[5:03:42] <jaygee303> In fairness, Sens fortress will be a cake walk compared to tomb of the giants
[5:03:43] <%KellBeII> youre in the 2nd deepest hole in the game, its gonna be tough to crawl out
[5:03:44] <+Shishi1205> and thank god you had the divine weapon y
[5:03:45] <+Peterbyte_> We not been to Sens yet?
[5:03:46] <seydaq> overall hes doing great though
[5:03:47] <RickyRelucent> no more no less
[5:03:53] <+Lordgale119> this place fucking sucks, don't worry, reggie
[5:03:55] <+セビー> DS2 isnt as bad, you can always warp in and out
[5:03:55] <%Deekman> His smile and optimism, gone.
[5:03:58] <+RyTYoung> VoteYea
[5:03:59] <Dabrikishaw> At least we can focus on the better parts of the mid-game next time
[5:04:12] <+Shady_Zaku> Skeleton Warriors put you in a Camel Clutch, made you HHHHAMBLE!
[5:04:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[5:04:33] <buerdo> I have 1000+ hours in Ds and i still give the beast skeletons the respect they deserve
[5:04:33] <+Shishi1205> yeah long range flinch works
[5:04:36] <DeathByPoke7> or it could be real nito

[5:18:39] <+セビー> @justcallmebobplease even just killing a bloated pyro snd getting toxic is a great mood setter
[5:18:41] <peachy996> I suppose it's more embarrassing dying to pinwheel when you're such a Dark Souls expert like Big Pat
[5:18:53] <RickyRelucent> @Sunstalker well, he didnt actually brave the skeldoges
[5:18:53] <seydaq> all jokes aside you did an excellent job
[5:18:54] <%A_German_spy> A_German_spy gifted a Tier 1 sub to Doggydogg20! 
[5:18:59] <RickyRelucent> so not exactly the lord gate
[5:19:00] <+vaderxyz1970> Sens House of FUN
[5:19:02] <justcallmebobplease> @セビー Reggie never seemed to reach true despair from Toxin, such as I saw.
[5:19:14] <oak120> @Sunstalker My first playthrough was getting to the gold gate without a light source. I wanted to quit.
[5:19:23] <generalve> MODS
[5:19:25] <%Rafraud> Reggie hits his first actual wall
[5:19:28] <+robertoszek> also doing blightown, catacombs and tomb of the giants back to back is rough
[5:19:44] <yaoihands1> that woolie plush is trapped, free him
[5:19:51] <wantedsafe471> has Reggie found Ash lake yet?
[5:19:51] <RickyRelucent> he's only there
[5:19:52] <RickyRelucent> BEFORE
[5:19:54] <%cubbywolf> chaaaaaat
[5:19:56] <seydaq> @rafraud and even then its a plot wall
[5:19:56] <RickyRelucent> the crew hits the catacombs
[5:20:00] <RickyRelucent> otherwise
[5:20:04] <RickyRelucent> he'd move to ToG
[5:20:05] <dmtjinni> chat has no chill
[5:20:06] <+セビー> @wantedsafe471 only the tree bonfire
[5:20:25] <wantedsafe471> ok, can't wait to see his reaction to that place
[5:20:25] <RickyRelucent> like
[5:20:26] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus they gonna release a Josuke spin-off with HOL HORSE , name of the manga :JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Crazy Diamond's Demonic Heartbreak
[5:20:29] <RickyRelucent> he kicks them down the pit
[5:20:32] <RickyRelucent> the chick and the guys
[5:20:37] <RickyRelucent> so why would he still be in catacombs
[5:20:42] <%cubbywolf> woolieCHAN
[5:20:46] <TheAmazingNick> Hey boys. Good luck on the session!
[5:21:16] <%cubbywolf> alot of those deaths were really fun
[5:21:20] <peachy996> You got boned
[5:21:21] <dmtjinni> LUL
[5:21:22] <+Jiggisnipe> so confident LUL
[5:21:26] <%Fefe41> At the end of the day we're all sadists looking to be entertained by the struggles of a first-timer
[5:21:30] <RickyRelucent> he did cata and tombs start in 4 hours
[5:21:34] <%cubbywolf> the point before you die LUL
[5:21:36] <RickyRelucent> i'd say he did really well
[5:21:38] <brunoberserk> flying too close to the sun , ICARUS
[5:21:41] <+Jiggisnipe> and then the wheels thought you about confidence
[5:21:41] <gryffinp> You can get comfortable on your third playthrough
[5:21:44] <dmtjinni> LUL LUL LUL
[5:21:45] <RickyRelucent> he went from balls in
[5:21:45] <+Jiggisnipe> taught*
[5:21:48] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:21:49] <RickyRelucent> balls out*
[5:21:49] <Wyldesquirrel> Reggie soared over the early walls, And the walls took that personally
[5:21:51] <peachy996> You can only be comfortable when the end credits play
[5:21:51] <RickyRelucent> to pack it in
[5:21:52] <bear_breaker20> reggie "always has a parachute" of course hes swinging
[5:21:54] <RickyRelucent> really quick
[5:21:57] <FaxineiroDePosto> @brunoberserk he talked about it in a recent podcast episode
[5:21:58] <oak120> Taunting that skeleton and getting parried
[5:22:00] <+robertoszek> "oh, you're cute"
[5:22:03] <Awesome_Leaf> skeleton karma LUL
[5:22:21] <AngryAsian5> "cute" LUL

[5:22:30] <$SilverRoddo> 💀 “oh, is this too easy for you?”
[5:22:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's not that slow in this game
[5:22:48] <FaxineiroDePosto> @brunoberserk no problemo, just letting you know
[5:22:48] <Chatterbox1991> """a boss"""
[5:22:53] <wantedsafe471> Actually I think the game is pretty hard

[5:22:57] <Chatterbox1991> i wonder who they me...
[5:23:00] <Johannen> @SilverRoddo I need to rewatch that again)

[5:23:04] <generalve> I only won the final bosses of Bloodborne with help

[5:23:13] <Awesome_Leaf> just the one boss actually
[5:23:14] <NiniGiovanini> must be OnS

[5:23:44] <scarman125> after doing the The Old Hunters DLC the final bosses of the base game are a cake walk
