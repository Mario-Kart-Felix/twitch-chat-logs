[0:05:01] <+dayz1003> you get one character for free.
[0:05:02] <+magnetix_LV> I got KI free somehow
[0:05:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think it's free to play but you gotta buy stuff
[0:05:07] <+magnetix_LV> I think on gamepass
[0:05:07] <+StrawberryPantsu> "Free" On Gamepass
[0:05:19] <+magnetix_LV> no but like its not on the service

[0:07:01] <+orochiblood> MK 10 definitely has rollback
[0:07:05] <+StrawberryPantsu> Can't buy MK9
[0:07:06] <%ggbhtg> MK X got the Rollback buff
[0:07:11] <leith_aziz> pickyOkay

[0:07:53] <leith_aziz> The air change gives me consistent dustloops with Sol. That shit feels addictive pickyStare
[0:07:55] <Crowroost> What if the League of Legends fighter came out, but you had to use premium currency to unlock rollback?

[0:33:43] <kasteni> A police cruiser needs to be the boss character.
[0:33:49] <DSD24> Bite's the Bitrate!
[0:33:52] <churropoppa> is this racing/fighting or just fighting?
[0:34:02] <dds333a> that camera angle SeemsGood
[0:34:07] <+Agentoracle> racing, with a racing / fighting mode.
[0:34:07] <+Fudgeworth_TM> I've just realised they could make a Sonic fighting game that works like this
[0:34:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> The dev is here! He can't chat because he needs to be a follower for 30 minutes, but he's watching.
[0:34:10] <DSD24> A Pinto
[0:34:11] <+TopTieramisu> can you turn off time limit?
[0:34:13] <velgaduere> a TESLA
[0:34:15] <leith_aziz> This is the type of game I wish was more popular
[0:34:15] <%Deft_Thought> Deft_Thought subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! What's good VS crew?
[0:34:16] <drunken_lemur> VW Beetle
[0:34:16] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:34:18] <DaKnightWarrior> Monster Truck
[0:34:19] <downmagic> PT cruiser is the DAN of this game
[0:34:22] <Hammatime8> I unironically hope there's an old beetle
[0:34:23] <leith_aziz> GARBAGE DAY! pickyDerp
[0:34:24] <+Crippl3> give me a Pontiac Aztek
[0:34:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> would a hummer be a grappler?
[0:34:26] <+cermo55> hot wheels dlc with this combat
[0:34:28] <+TopTieramisu> sick
[0:34:29] <%NickHatesSnow> VW Beetles rule tho
[0:34:33] <Mach5Mike> An Ferrari-esque car that looks like it's from Outrun would be awesome
[0:34:36] <%andrewofbob> Some Chelsea Tractor uses armoured moves
[0:34:39] <DSD24> A Pinto has the lowest health but biggest damage
[0:34:45] <Wyldesquirrel> Speed Racers secret move: Bicycle Kick
[0:34:49] <downmagic> the AMC gremlin
[0:34:56] <+RemedyofRevenge> they better put super moves in like Ghost Ride the Whip or something lol
[0:35:00] <%NickHatesSnow> A DeLorean but with time stop
[0:35:04] <+FuqBoiSlim> Ford Pintos are definitely rushdowns I feel
[0:35:12] <enerkaizer> Trucks or semis as grapplers would be so sick
[0:35:15] <kasteni> This is awesome
[0:35:16] <DSD24> @FuqBoiSlim All rushdown no healt h
[0:35:18] <Mach5Mike> Shoot, can we just get the Mach 5 in here?
[0:35:20] <dds333a> yo, reg is sick
[0:35:21] <+Kharinite> Jesus the bitrate lol
[0:35:21] <Hammatime8> @Mach5Mike I'd argue taht's already in the game.
[0:35:46] <+FuqBoiSlim> @dsd24 the Chip Zanuff of the car world
[0:35:51] <+Agentoracle> Next characters: A Monster Truck as the Grappler, a Hearse as the Puppet character, and, let's go with a snow plough for the zoner.
[0:35:52] <miucsa51> the only thing missing are some supers
[0:35:53] <Wyldesquirrel> A hippy style VW bus that uses drunken master style moves
[0:35:58] <+RemedyofRevenge> the speedlines somehow screw the bitrate so hard
[0:36:10] <DSD24> Hummer is the Grappler
[0:36:14] <dds333a> @miucsa51 yeah, maybe one more than the one
[0:36:19] <+Canti510> Who got the Zamboni main?
[0:36:23] <Mach5Mike> @Mach5Mike I think of a convertible when I think of the Outrun car though
[0:36:26] <enerkaizer> But, again, this game would be perfect to include K.I.T.T. from Knightrider. all the moves are already there
[0:36:29] <DSD24> Aerial Midair Grinding!
[0:36:38] <OldManDeckardCain> I can't wait until they add a car suplexing other cars
[0:36:41] <Wyldesquirrel> Theres 1 motorcycle and its the Akuma of the game
[0:36:44] <dds333a> LUL

[1:02:29] <+orochiblood> Nintendo's excuse that they need to constantly re-invent the wheel with certain games sucks
[1:02:32] <%VirgilGC> F Zero is amazing, but lets be real nobody will care once its out
[1:02:40] <%kyh9> We gonna get Forza Horizon 5 on Race Wars?

[1:02:51] <Mach5Mike> @ChoculaUltra GP Legend actually has a sequel, it's called F-Zero Climax but only came out in Japan
[1:02:53] <DSD24> But then Star Fox has to have the same game over and over
[1:03:02] <Hammatime8> Hold up, was Woolie playing the demo the whole time?

[1:03:19] <%kyh9> No
[1:03:20] <dds333a> more, even
[1:03:20] <Qsmash_> I believe F-Zero's absence is because they don't try to push tech anymore and F-Zero was used to show off their processing power.
[1:03:21] <%nintega010> @dsd24 I wanted a Star Fox Assualt 2

[1:03:31] <%Prevot> did f-zero sell well? cause if it didn't they have no reason to just make another identical one
[1:03:42] <Mach5Mike> If F-Zero comes back, Captain Falcon had better be Ryu Suzaku along with the other GP Legend and GX characters, not just the 30 from X again
[1:03:47] <Hammatime8> @Hammatime8 Gotcha
[1:03:47] <leith_aziz> It's interesting how much I hear about Nintendo's influence having never owned a Nintendo console
[1:03:50] <%asakura_ayase> “We don’t do that here”
[1:03:50] <tanarath> Their cowardice is also why they do good stuff sometimes?
[1:03:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the meteor cannot come soon enough
[1:03:56] <%kyh9> I think it's also they don't have any devs who want to make those games
[1:03:59] <DSD24> @nintega010 I really like that game! It'd be nice if we got a sequel
[1:03:59] <+LCGOV> Nintendo is in a state where they can do whatever the fuck they want because they will always make money, it's the Disney effect
[1:04:01] <Zeif00> @WoolieVersus Dev is here
[1:04:12] <%kyh9> I CANNOT BELIEVE
[1:04:13] <tanarath> They stay in their area, so they do some stuff really well.

[1:04:32] <%kyh9> WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS COMPANY
[1:04:35] <%ggbhtg> you became vince mcmahon there, which is appropriate
[1:04:35] <Mach5Mike> Just.. make the F-Zero game, make it good, and people will buy it, seems simple enough unless you're Nintendo
[1:04:37] <leith_aziz> I mean, sometimes sticking to old roots is a good thing, but this is deffinitely one of those cases where thats NOT a good thing
[1:04:56] <%ChoculaUltra> can we at least get like a F-Zero GX remaster for the switch
[1:05:03] <Wyldesquirrel> If there is ever a new F-Zero I want Falcon portrayed as a Heihachi-like mythical figure, and for some reason an old man villain
