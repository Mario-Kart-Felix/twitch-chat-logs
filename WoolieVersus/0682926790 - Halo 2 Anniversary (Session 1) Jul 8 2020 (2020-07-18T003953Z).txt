[0:03:21] <Saffry_Ruzin> Do they know about how Co-op skips the intro Cutscenes?
[0:03:21] <%TomFrancis_> HEROIC LORETHROUGH
[0:03:24] <dabeaminator> Apparently starting on Co-op skips the first mission as well? This is unverified, but a few people have mentioned it.
[0:03:24] <%doomerskeletor13> The terminals are not spoilery really
[0:03:24] <ergheisu> GET IN THAT LORE

[0:03:35] <DigitalJoshie> damn, V also coming at us with the mix ups
[0:03:37] <%M3djedx> Halo lore is so dank
[0:03:43] <Halospaz117> Mechassault was fuckin rad
[0:03:44] <%optimasmaximas> @prime_name halo 5 marketing was obviously halo 6 marketing if you go back and watch, it’s fucking weird they chose that
[0:03:47] <BurdRightsActivist> MECHASSAULT YEAH YEAH YE
[0:03:51] <%Solidnick18> it was alright
[0:03:52] <%dinnydanny777> Halo Lore is good lore
[0:03:54] <DSD24> Mech Assault was fun
[0:03:57] <+JustToWatch> This is the perfect background for fucking around in breath of the wild
[0:03:58] <+Invaderjaymz> Loved Mech Assault
[0:04:00] <MrIntake> 1st the darkness was great
[0:04:05] <Deadmanslegacy> lol
[0:04:05] <Ynkubus_> Dude, the Mechassualts were great

[0:04:08] <IndoorSitup> Does Little V know that playing Halo 2 in co op skips the intro cutscenes?
[0:04:10] <DSD24> Anyone remember Chromehounds!?
[0:04:11] <%Slimshazbot> @Deadpal The only halo 5 thing is that Locke voices like 3 of them with zero context as to who he is, other than that it's all Arbiter lore
[0:04:11] <%black_pariah> that final mech was bonkers
[0:04:12] <dailylifewithry> Precursor lore now
[0:04:17] <%dinnydanny777> I like Armored Core
[0:04:19] <Saffry_Ruzin> Halo 2 is a Lore game Kappa
[0:04:20] <stayinthepocket> Halo is better scifi now than Star Wars
[0:04:20] <Halospaz117> One of my fondest memory as a kids was playing Mechassault and kicking my Dad's friends asses on Xbox live
[0:04:22] <+TheShisno> The fat Duke
[0:04:29] <%dinnydanny777> I quite liked Armored Core
[0:04:29] <Catpurrple> I loved Mechassault.
[0:04:30] <ThaSparren> All hail the duke
[0:04:30] <DSD24> @dinnydanny777 Armored Core is awesome
[0:04:31] <CISphil> Yoooooo get in! Just finished my legendary playthrough of this and it's still fucking amazing
[0:04:35] <Deadmanslegacy> fuck the duke
[0:04:35] <%Solidnick18> those guitar hands
[0:04:36] <marvel877> Okay Andre the Giant...
[0:04:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> is that little V?!
[0:04:38] <armchairmaster_> The D U K E approves
[0:04:40] <DigitalJoshie> play DMC5 on the duke
[0:04:41] <dabeaminator> I hated that thing so much
[0:04:43] <+TheOneCalledRock> holy FUCK
[0:04:44] <zocano> Mechassault 2 has hilarious liscenced music like Getting Away with Murder for a giant spidermech boss and it's *GREAT*
[0:04:45] <+Invaderjaymz> The DUKE was the trainer of MEN
[0:04:46] <+JustToWatch> we need a seagull for scale
[0:04:46] <%Hammerknife> woolie is streaming in the morning and i'm too sleepy to pay attention
[0:04:46] <slamview> I wish I had V sized hands to make playing bass easier
[0:04:48] <+Ryu_R> damn son
[0:04:49] <alrobot2014> oh V's hand is big enough to wield the duke
[0:04:51] <brian_peppers1> Ladies love him
[0:04:52] <%Lizard0TM> I loved the Duke controller
[0:04:53] <%subjectg> kinda glad i never experienced the duke
[0:04:54] <GHouseduivel> Big hands Kreygasm
[0:04:54] <REGNIERx> hold me with those big hands pls
[0:04:55] <%SuperKirby24> I approve of the D U K E
[0:04:56] <Saffry_Ruzin> Getting away with Murder
[0:05:06] <Klefth> The Duke is basically what if we take the Dreamcast controller and make it worse?
[0:05:07] <dabeaminator> I see that Jojo mug
[0:05:07] <marvel877> NO the Micro is too small
[0:05:09] <+Invaderjaymz> Can you believe there are probably people in here who don't even know the power of the D U K E?
[0:05:09] <TheChucklingOak> The Duke has big protagonist energy
[0:05:11] <$QueequegTheater> Xbone/360 controller is just right for big hands
[0:05:11] <+TheShisno> It really is
[0:05:12] <%Theycallmenerf> [D E X T E R O U S]
[0:05:15] <tanngnj0str> DUALSCHOCK 4 BABY
[0:05:15] <alaskanbullwurm> dualshock 4 is smooth
[0:05:15] <%Slimshazbot> Only good DS is DS4
[0:05:16] <Self_esteampunk> hard agree
[0:05:16] <SinnerBeta> John "the Spartan" Halo is back
[0:05:19] <Ransom73> Nah 360
[0:05:19] <BurdRightsActivist> 360 BEST CONTROLLER
[0:05:20] <VidulaSaix> Big agree
[0:05:21] <%Solidnick18> same
[0:05:23] <@Menitta> DS4 is really nice
[0:05:23] <Jmann1892> The Duke is Perfection Woolie
[0:05:23] <%Hammerknife> the best controller is the pre-dual shock ps1 controller
[0:05:24] <%jinking79> Damn that all star mug
[0:05:24] <%dinnydanny777> The Gamecube controller is est
[0:05:25] <FinalblueMan> 360 BEST
[0:05:26] <+CycloneEternalJoker> same
[0:05:26] <Catpurrple> The only thing I don't like about the dualshocks is how easy it is to activate the triggers putting it down on a table.
[0:05:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Super agree
[0:05:28] <%dinnydanny777> Gamechbe
[0:05:29] <+krispen_wa> 360 BOIS RISE UP
[0:05:30] <+xmetalicdemonx> 360
[0:05:30] <%jetjagger222> jojo mug
[0:05:30] <%sunsetserenity1> Xbone One or 360
[0:05:30] <%Jack8274> The triggers always go off by accident
[0:05:32] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah
[0:05:33] <dailylifewithry> Pretty much
[0:05:33] <%dinnydanny777> Gamecube > all
[0:05:35] <%subjectg> 360 thumbstick layout is more comfy imo
[0:05:36] <%optimasmaximas> xb1 controller is my fav
[0:05:36] <dabeaminator> The useless touchpad as well
[0:05:38] <%Theycallmenerf> 360 golden age
[0:05:38] <%YakumoYomi> I don't like the DS4's touchpad, but it's otherwise fine
[0:05:40] <vulkan_vibes> gamecube op
[0:05:40] <IndoorSitup> Is V aware that playing Halo 2 in co op skips the intro cutscenes?
[0:05:41] <armchairmaster_> Except there's no TRIGGER GUARD, V.
[0:05:42] <Klefth> DS4 is my favorite so far. I can't wait to get my hands on the new PS5 controller for my PC
[0:05:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Dualshock is my fave
[0:05:44] <DigitalJoshie> I perfer the Xbone controller, Duelshock 4 is also good
[0:05:45] <ghoulishcripple> yo sick i have the same XBone controller
[0:05:50] <$QueequegTheater> DS4 is the only PS controller better than X360
[0:05:52] <DSD24> DS4 has shit battery life
[0:05:53] <%ChoculaUltra> what?! don't you love setting your controller down and accidentally accelerating into a wall?
[0:05:58] <+number_1_ninja> the duke is a leathal weapon
[0:06:00] <deadpoolking16> No
[0:06:00] <CISphil> Xbox one controller is objectively the best. You are outright wrong if you believe otherwise.
[0:06:04] <supersparta12345> I have a third party ps3 controller that is phenomenal
[0:06:05] <Halospaz117> Why would Reach be next?
[0:06:05] <Klefth> Oh yeah, DS4 battery life is hideous
[0:06:06] <huskarl_zap> No stop at 2
[0:06:06] <%Solidnick18> no rush
[0:06:09] <+TheShisno> DS4 > 360 > One > Joy Con > Wiimote > DS3
[0:06:10] <$QueequegTheater> MONUMENT
[0:06:13] <+penjaza> Reach is great but can wait

[0:06:20] <marvel877> FEED HIM
[0:06:20] <+BallinArbiter> Arbiter is best boy
[0:06:21] <12345wery> I hate the DPAD location on the PS4 controller
[0:06:23] <+DappercatEsquire> WOOLIE IS FED
[0:06:25] <+Ancopro> 3 is the end of john halo trilogy
[0:06:26] <dailylifewithry> Anniversary Graphics?
[0:06:26] <%subjectg> i’m fine with a break after 2
[0:06:27] <huskarl_zap> The Elite on halo Was the Arbiter prove me wrong
[0:06:27] <%ChoculaUltra> I can't even remember when the last time I saw all 3 battery pips at full for my DS4, ngl
[0:06:28] <razieltano123> Shhhhh. No Spoilers.
[0:06:28] <Joestar1890> Don't you mean Halo 3 or Halo 3 ODST?
[0:06:28] <%prime_name> @WoolieVersus Eat the airplane!
[0:06:29] <black0193> Find out now in Halo 2: COVENANT DEFEATED
[0:06:30] <DSD24> Hol Up
[0:06:30] <%mechslayer71> Reach is fantastic, but it’s down the line
[0:06:31] <+Bluemanzee> We haven't even started John 2 yet
[0:06:32] <VidulaSaix> I saw that subreddit thread today LUL
[0:06:32] <+ntfth> Its been so long since I've touched campaign, I wonder how far they can get in two this strem.
[0:06:33] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:06:33] <Depthcharge2030> This is literally the highlight of my Wednesdays
[0:06:34] <tanngnj0str> The anniversary custcenes look so fucking good, almost too good.

[0:06:35] <%ringabal> Get the big spoon
[0:06:37] <guenbooty> Keith David PogChamp
[0:06:37] <%DomunDomunDomun> Only reason to possibly play reach next would've been if halo 3 wasn't coming out next week.
[0:06:37] <FinalblueMan> should always play in release order
[0:06:38] <%optimasmaximas> oh no LUL
[0:06:39] <@Menitta> "I'm really excited for the part of the game where its awesome"
[0:06:40] <+Williamld> You're gonna get to the prequel books?
[0:06:43] <marvel877> Its just a waifer thin mint, Woolie.
[0:06:44] <baron_b0nes> "YA FEELIN' WELL FED, V?"
[0:06:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> WOOLIE, OPEN UP FOR THE LORE PLANE! NYOOOOOM!

[0:06:51] <Klefth> Do check those out. They're great
[0:06:51] <alrobot2014> oh yeah the music in p5a is great
[0:06:52] <leroyslammin> Halo 3's noice
[0:06:53] <dabeaminator> They actually aren't great IMO
[0:06:55] <Halospaz117> Persona music is good, more at 5
[0:06:56] <TheChucklingOak> It's true, the sub reallllly needs to get good at spoiler tagging. I know you guys are excited, but simmer down a little
[0:06:56] <Shardlab> Wassup with this reloading with the shoulder button shit?
[0:06:57] <$QueequegTheater> Terminal or feed, V is fed
[0:06:59] <BurdRightsActivist> >persona 5. Watch a GOOD Persona anime, like the P2 Anime we were SUPPOSED to have
[0:07:02] <%Solidnick18> not worth 300
[0:07:04] <+kewlmyc> Dark Sun is specifically pretty good
[0:07:05] <%optimasmaximas> the openings and endings are GREAT
[0:07:07] <%dinnydanny777> You'll never see it coming
[0:07:10] <%Goingchrisb3> what comes first, ODST or 3 in the timeline? been ages since i played those
[0:07:11] <@Menitta> THANKS ANIPLEX
[0:07:11] <nxflre> Coop doesnt get INtro cutscene!
[0:07:13] <ergheisu> I can't believe we spoiled Master Chief and Cortana's sex scene
[0:07:13] <+TheShisno> Thanks, Japan
[0:07:13] <dabeaminator> The first P4 anime is amazing
[0:07:15] <%black_pariah> ANIPLEX
[0:07:15] <$QueequegTheater> "We want you to pirate this"
[0:07:15] <correctedsun117> 25% OFF EVEN
[0:07:15] <BlackermanZX> I love dark sun
[0:07:19] <ergheisu> wait wrong sub
[0:07:20] <Halospaz117> Oh god that all out attack
[0:07:23] <Joestar1890> I liked Break in to Break out more than Dark Sun, the op animation ruined it for me
[0:07:27] <vulkan_vibes> SOFT
[0:07:28] <CISphil> @nxflre Seriously?
[0:07:30] <+ZoltanBMagnus> I can't wait for woolie to read every single Halo book live ons tream in a row without stopping
[0:07:30] <guenbooty> ODST takes place during Halo 2
[0:07:30] <+krispen_wa> Everyone with me: FUCK ANIPLEX
[0:07:33] <%optimasmaximas> SO BAD LUL
[0:07:35] <Catpurrple> I don't know where you could fit Reach in that works well, it's either before the John Halo trilogy and you get controls whiplash moving onto CE, or after the trilogy like it released. In between seems weird.
[0:07:35] <Ransom73> P5 anime is poo
[0:07:37] <+TheShisno> Not even Aniplex, that's just anime blu-ray prices
[0:07:42] <%jinking79> Rum them shoes
[0:07:43] <BlackermanZX> Break In To Break Out also is pretty good
[0:07:43] <@Menitta> the P4 anime had some fun scenes
[0:07:46] <dabeaminator> @guenbooty You mean 3?
[0:07:46] <$Hotironclad> day breakers was fine
[0:07:49] <BurdRightsActivist> The all out attack was soft to begin with LUL
[0:07:51] <xxshadowxx416> odst first then halo 3
[0:07:51] <dundunsun> Did they talk about Halo 3 yet?
[0:07:54] <@CrankyVT> good taste
[0:07:54] <@Menitta> like double chie
[0:07:56] <%chll0ne> the p4 anime was great tho
[0:07:57] <MegaApple18> Hey Woolie how have you been?
[0:08:00] <Saffry_Ruzin> Halo 3 is coming out the 14th
[0:08:01] <squidmax1> Oh yeah the manga art is WAY better.
[0:08:02] <TheChucklingOak> They haven't even played 3 yet, dude
[0:08:02] <BurdRightsActivist> RACE CRIMES??
[0:08:04] <FinalblueMan> ooh that's a hot take
[0:08:06] <vulkan_vibes> agreed on odst
[0:08:07] <unit24> anime bluray prices are always bad, it's just that Aniplex specifically prices stuff the way it is in japan, which is way worse
[0:08:09] <fritzinthehouse> Thanks for the PrideUnicorn @rodreeg91
[0:08:12] <InXplotch> beaststars is fuckin' sick. the anime glosses over a bunch of stuff for time
[0:08:13] <@CrankyVT> The anime does its best but the manga has literally 10x the impact with its double splash pages
[0:08:15] <nxflre> Coop doesnt get intro cutscene!!!
[0:08:16] <+EMFole> HALO 2 LETS GO
[0:08:17] <@Squdnate> Not related to anything on the stream; I just wanna remind chat that Deadly Premonition 2 is running like dank ass dog shit, so go and buy it <3
[0:08:19] <dabeaminator> Snek Cop
[0:08:19] <%CptnCampy61> CptnCampy61 converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!
[0:08:20] <CyrusVGZ> Atlus: We're not porting P5 to Switch. Go watch the anime. Aniplex: The DVD and Blu-ray is $300 if you don't want to support Crunchyroll. Kappa
[0:08:23] <Shardlab> @TheShisno That's anime Bluray prices in Japan. Trying to do that globally is really grimy
[0:08:36] <%DomunDomunDomun> I can show you the wooorld
[0:08:37] <fritzinthehouse> PrideUnicorn PrideUnicorn PrideUnicorn
[0:08:42] <%ringabal> With anime, the answer is always money
[0:08:45] <squidmax1> Brand New Animal is out too BTW.
[0:08:52] <BurdRightsActivist> Beaststars Cops show up and immediately shoot the carnivores without skipping a beat
[0:08:56] <IndoorSitup> Yo does Little V know that playing Halo 2 in co op skips intro cutscenes?
[0:08:58] <armchairmaster_> Give me [ T H E W O R L D ]
[0:08:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Big awkward vore sexual tension, all the time.
[0:09:00] <gladsomepraetorian> Remember to do single player first to get the initial cutscene.
[0:09:02] <%subjectg> I think they had to condense a bunch of stuff to cut it down to 12 episodes
[0:09:02] <maskedmustelid> BNA > Beastars
[0:09:03] <ghoulishcripple> Thats because the Beastars anime is for furry bait dollars. despite the manga growing beyond it
[0:09:04] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Read the My Hero manga, the author is a true man of taste
[0:09:07] <%laserbeaming> V, who's best girl and why is it Juno?
[0:09:13] <BurdRightsActivist> Unironically liking p5 LUL LUL
[0:09:15] <Saffry_Ruzin> Yeah, gotta do Singleplayer
[0:09:16] <guenbooty> Pretty sure ODST takes place in new Mombasa, after the level there in 2
[0:09:22] <nxflre> Single PLayer first to get intro cutscene!
[0:09:25] <dabeaminator> Brand New Animal's first episode killed all interest. Peak high school fanfic writing.
[0:09:26] <Saffry_Ruzin> for the opening
[0:09:28] <+mars_driver> I FAR prefer P4, because you get plenty of time to have the party just hang out, whereas P5 was just you running from each target to the next with little downtime.
[0:09:32] <%optimasmaximas> @burdrightsactivist hey :rage:q
[0:09:37] <%chll0ne> persona 5: style over substance
[0:09:37] <Nested_Dreams> BNA is just Kill La Kill again and I don't know whether to be upset or not
[0:09:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> I like p5 just not as much as p4 if I'm being honest
[0:09:43] <boltstrykex> shut it guenbooty no spoilers
[0:09:44] <RoldanDgr8> BNA is not better Beastars
[0:09:45] <zocano> ODST takes place in the middle of Halo 2, yes
[0:09:47] <%rsb2025> rsb2025 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Halo 2 lets gooooo my first halo glad you guys are playing it have fun

[0:09:50] <%CptnCampy61> CptnCampy61 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[0:09:53] <FinalblueMan> yeah, start as single player to get the intro scene
[0:09:53] <leroyslammin> I kinda want a SMT 3 Nocturne anime. Does that technically count as a Persona game?
[0:09:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:09:54] <Joestar1890> Le-Le-Le-Le-MAXIMUM
[0:09:57] <%falconcrunchv2> single player for cutscene fam don't forget
[0:09:59] <guenbooty> I was trying my best haha city name isn’t a spoiler right?
[0:10:01] <+TheShisno> Can't wait for P5 on PC in 8 years so I can mod Morgana out of the game
[0:10:01] <+krispen_wa> SO YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE X FACTOR?
[0:10:04] <dailylifewithry> Oh no, we’ve attracted the SMT/Persona fan base. Time for P5 to be the worst game ever made
[0:10:07] <%chll0ne> p2>p1>p3>p4>p5
[0:10:15] <%Nomad94> I only played the Halo 2 Remaster once, but it looked amazing
[0:10:17] <%dinnydanny777> So we never found out what a Halo really is did we?
[0:10:19] <Shardlab> If you go into BNA expecting Beastars, you've already fucked up
[0:10:22] <%r0chelimit> cheer500 hey guys started keto a week and a half ago and im down 12 pounds! This is the first diet I've ever tried, wanted to ask how you guys stay committed to it?

[0:10:33] <%masterpiecejeremy> masterpiecejeremy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey Woolie and V. With Deadly Premonition 2 around the corner, is there any change of a metal Whistling Song cover?
[0:10:35] <%Nomad94> @dinnydanny777 Yes, we did. It eradicated any life with biomass that can sustain the Flod.
[0:10:37] <%Nomad94> *Flood
[0:10:38] <$QueequegTheater> @dinnydanny777 They found out it's a weapon but that's it

[0:10:50] <dabeaminator> P4 is better written than P5, but P5R is the best Persona game in all regards.
[0:10:52] <BurdRightsActivist> @OldManDeckardCain P3 > P2* I see you had a typo there bud, just fixed that for you
[0:10:52] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Does Little V know that playing Halo 2 in co op skips intro cutscenes?

[0:11:11] <+GeneralHysterics> Speaking of, Y'all need to listen to bear ghost, they're great.
[0:11:12] <leroyslammin> I can't help but consider SMT and Persona to be the same series. The same way I consider Digimon and Appmon the same series.

[0:12:01] <@Squdnate> SHOW ME THE WAY
[0:12:02] <TheChucklingOak> Yeah, they gotta avoid the copyright strike
[0:12:04] <jasonisgold79> Yeah from what I heard, the remaster for Halo 2 is on a whole other level than the remaster for Halo 1.
[0:12:04] <%chll0ne> @fuqboislim its def not. none of the persona games are bad imo
[0:12:05] <Catpurrple> I also prefer the original music.

[0:12:24] <OldManDeckardCain> p5r 3rd semester is better than both p5 og and p4
[0:12:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU ARE THE FUCKING MAN BRO
[0:12:25] <%Goingchrisb3> halo 2 is a movie script that you can play
[0:12:26] <%Nomad94> You're a goddamn hero
[0:12:26] <fearlesssavant12> breaking benjamin
[0:12:27] <TheChucklingOak> Wait what? Screw copyright I guess!
[0:12:27] <%chll0ne> personally i like the persona 1 cast more than the 5 cast but id take p5 gameplay over 1’s
[0:12:29] <Shardlab> I.... don't think I've ever played Halo 2 all the way through
[0:12:30] <BurdRightsActivist> Swip back and forth during the master chief COLOSTOMY BAG cutscene
[0:12:35] <dabeaminator> We appreciate your research V. Best boy.
[0:12:36] <nxflre> single player first for intro cutscene!
[0:12:41] <+ntfth> I'd still say that 343 Guilty Spark and the Library looked much better on Classic than Remastered.
[0:12:43] <%falconcrunchv2> @subjectg Marty just did an interview talking about that same thing about the cutscenes.
[0:12:45] <thesoldierofjoy> Just make sure not to switch back for too long because... Twitch rules.
[0:12:48] <sniffy77> the galaxy was also reseeded with preserved species
[0:12:52] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @QueequegTheater
[0:12:56] <PlasticJake> the new cutscenes look good, but it's jarring after going from cutscenes rendered in-engine to blur cutscenes that don't look anything like the game
[0:12:57] <Shardlab> So I'mma dip and play through entirely before ya'll do
[0:12:59] <liphttam1> I only played halo 2 recently and i have no idea what the moment is lol
[0:12:59] <%notgarza> MAHVEL BAYBEE
[0:13:00] <%Nomad94> The Hunter worms for example can't sustain the Flood

[0:14:57] <%Goingchrisb3> is that a Jojo cup V is drinking from
[0:14:59] <%falconcrunchv2> @subjectg not at all fam. His reasoning made sense seeing as how the cutscenes were still sort of ingame so it blends together with the gameplay. blur made everything look pretty but in a way it takes away from the experience. still dope to look at.

[0:15:38] <jasonisgold79> Fun Fact: All the enemies in the Halo Universe have actual species names. Think of the names we know them as (Elites, Grunts, etc.) as their military codenames. But they actually have names for their species.

[0:17:50] <jasonisgold79> To be fair, that's probably what got Little V into playing guitar and making music in the first place.
[0:17:51] <Pookiedaexzile> OooooooooOoooh
[0:17:52] <%mechslayer71> I think people blame age for stupidity too much. Certain levels of stupidity are just the person, not the age
[0:17:53] <TheChucklingOak> Yeah, that Spoiler Man from the Spoiler Times was a total simp for Other Spoiler Man
[0:17:53] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Does Little V know that playing Halo 2 in co op skips intro cutscenes??

[0:18:10] <%Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 i think i messed up in selling Dragon Age to you before; Dragon Age actually does more to shake up the traditional Fantasy RPG then you'd think with it's world building; Dwarfs, for example, who would tend be the most boring race in a fantasy story, live in a underground city surrounded by a river of molten lava, they have a proto-Roman society filled with arena combat, Byzantine political drama, AKA, the least steriotypically Dwarven stuff ive seen, this is Dragon Age strength.

[0:19:41] <sniffy77> season 3 is far better
[0:19:41] <jasonisgold79> Question: Was the music during the Halo 1 playthrough the original music or the remade music?
[0:19:41] <%Feralspirit41> 2 and 4 arent

[0:21:25] <%dinnydanny777> Oh Konhak, not Cognac lol
[0:21:30] <+Xchunkylover73x> ITALIANS LIKE PASTA NOT FAKE PASTA

[0:21:38] <$QueequegTheater> Cognac noodles are probably better

[0:21:46] <YamadaZero> DSP is the pasta expert.
[0:21:47] <nxflre> Guys keep reminding them to start the game i singleplayer to get the intro cutscene!

[0:23:20] <+Jake_Protagonist> blow me away
[0:23:23] <ZeeJiggle> I also forgot it was quite short.
[0:23:31] <+Ancopro> halo 3 LUL
[0:23:33] <Kiryurules> Short and sweet
[0:23:36] <+D00msDayDan> Blown away, huh?
[0:23:40] <Halospaz117> 2 is probably the longest one
[0:23:41] <%dinnydanny777> I didn't know Halo 1 was so short honestly
[0:23:44] <Ynkubus_> Sowrdflying in 2 makes that easy
[0:23:44] <DinoBear_7> Speaking of that, Halo 2 speedruns are fucking wild
[0:23:45] <alrobot2014> i think those achievements are actually named after speedrunners too
[0:23:46] <ZeeJiggle> I sure hope the 2 Anniversary blows you away.
[0:23:54] <%Slimshazbot> 2 is longer and much tougher
[0:23:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:23:57] <VidulaSaix> A tight 5-6 hours is the best. See; Revengeance
[0:24:01] <+yhom_tork> the witcher NotLikeThis
[0:24:03] <dabeaminator> I think Reach is the longest? Not sure though.
[0:24:04] <IndoorSitup> Does Little V know that playing Halo 2 in co op skips intro cutscenes??
[0:24:05] <%MacabreOpus> Very short. One moment 'halo' the next 'goodbye'
[0:24:06] <%dinnydanny777> Halo 1 feels kind of like a proof of concept
[0:24:06] <TheChucklingOak> Of course, now V needs to throw Woolie in the multiplayerr pits
[0:24:08] <%subjectg> the halo 2 agdq run is a must-see after this
[0:24:08] <+azraith> Odyssey is an awesome game but like 30 hours too long
[0:24:08] <+Juriasu> the cutscenes in halo 2 anniversary are Kreygasm
[0:24:09] <JetpackMcQuack> More arcade modes
[0:24:10] <%DomunDomunDomun> 2 is shorter, it just disguises it by splitting the levels in half, and claiming a cutscene is a level.
[0:24:10] <%jiggy_snipe> that's how I feel about albums, 30 mins is good
[0:24:10] <Zebroneath> Don't need a bloated 45 hr game
[0:24:10] <joshua_42> RE games pl
[0:24:17] <+Jake_Protagonist> My friend and I streamed all of Halo 1 in 5 hours last night. We were super drained by Library but then the Maw revived our souls
[0:24:19] <fabo_joyful> V's GLOVES ARE DOPE!
[0:24:23] <%eyezehuhh> apparently that's a hot take on twitter
[0:24:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Life is too short to only play long games.
[0:24:45] <%sunsetserenity1> Don't say that, Neil Druckmann will find you
[0:24:47] <mr_sups> It's the difference between Comics, Webtoons, and Manga.
[0:24:54] <%RioGascar> Pacing is very important
[0:25:05] <+smacksfenton> Hey chat just showing up after a while, did woolie like halo 1?
[0:25:07] <jasonisgold79> Personal Take: You should watch/play/consume things you think or you know you will enjoy and have fun. Not sith through shit you know you don't like just for the sole purpose of making fun of it or just to complain.
[0:25:11] <RetributionP> halo 2 was my first halo for Windows!
[0:25:12] <%masterpiecejeremy> Games too longs? don't make me quote Teddy Roosevelt at you!
[0:25:19] <FiendishlyInventive> when we start do y'all think?
[0:25:24] <jasonisgold79> *sit throught
[0:25:33] <+Bluemanzee> "Let me just put this here..." *Teddy quote*
[0:25:34] <dabeaminator> Probably soon
[0:25:38] <+phatmac16> Some games are too long and are have meaningless content to fill time
[0:25:38] <%chll0ne> anyone play helltaker
[0:25:53] <+krispen_wa> Middle Ground? What are you, a filthy Moralist?
[0:25:53] <Sander_VF> I've been waiting for this!
[0:25:54] <%DesDavis> which is also why older games were hard af
[0:26:00] <%RioGascar> Like i wanna take something im deciding to watch for the first real time. Lord of the rings extended edition (i watched as a kid so i dont really count it)
[0:26:01] <FiendishlyInventive> !uptime!
[0:26:06] <+phatmac16> Like Fallout 4’s infinite filler quests which are a waste of time
[0:26:09] <%chll0ne> @phatmac16 TLOU2 Kappa
[0:26:09] <Saffry_Ruzin> I hope they don't start with Co-op so the opening scenes don't get skipped
[0:26:11] <YamadaZero> Better to have five hours of greatness, than twenty hours of mediocrity.
[0:26:11] <DSD24> @chll0ne Justice is the best Demon
[0:26:13] <%xiidrifty> I don't know if it's been said already but if you're playing on anniversary, skip the first cutscene immediately. It fast forwards into Halo 5, and then flashbacks into the entirety of Halo 2
[0:26:18] <%RioGascar> and the pacing in that is a bit fast at the start CAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH SHIT TO DO
[0:26:18] <VidulaSaix> For me it's honestly more than I just begin to get exhausting with what the game is presenting me with. A 50+ hour experience CAN be good, but often times it's not and is padded with endless filler
[0:26:19] <+Bluemanzee> Long games are fantastic, but only if they have the content for it and aren't artificially lengthened just to say "We made a long game"
[0:26:23] <%Bear_Hermit_Pandafooo> @masterpiecejeremy LUL
[0:26:26] <dabeaminator> Given that the entire series is $30 right now, it's more than worth it for the length you get.
[0:26:27] <+ntfth> They're aware.
[0:26:30] <thetransagenda> they know to skip the cutscene
[0:26:33] <%canadiancaesar98> Took the words right out of my mouth, V.
[0:26:35] <%M3djedx> I’m also a huge fan of games keeping updates well after a year.
[0:26:38] <%RioGascar> God of war 2016 kept going and going and going
[0:26:42] <%jiggy_snipe> long games are fine if the pacing and content is there
[0:26:48] <Klefth> There's also value to short games, and value to long games. It's almost like people shouldn't generalize
[0:26:52] <%RioGascar> I loved it
[0:26:52] <+phatmac16> Indie games have been a great thing for adult gamers
[0:26:53] <derap41> Not to be topical but TLoU2 Suffer by feeling really stretched for the story it tells
[0:26:53] <TheChucklingOak> You can skip the spoiler cutscene without skipping the "real" intro?
[0:26:55] <Catpurrple> That's my favorite fun fact
[0:26:56] <VidulaSaix> WORT WORT WORT
[0:27:00] <ghoulishcripple> i think its also you notice the bloat in games as you get older because you have less time. my biggest problem with Control is its unneeded rpg bloat that drags down the story pacing
[0:27:01] <%RioGascar> but man it just kept going MOVING THE END GOAL
[0:27:03] <drewofthedew> WORT WORT WORT

[0:27:20] <+phatmac16> TLOU2 is too long for its own good
[0:27:20] <%Slimshazbot> 2's my personal favorite campaign
[0:27:24] <thesoddenknight> Does V know anything about Marathon?

[0:27:25] <Duke_of_HI> Will Little V show Woolie that one GUN that is Difficult to get and used only in One Level?
[0:27:26] <%johnny_gogo> 3 is soo good
[0:27:26] <zocano> yep 3 is the best
[0:27:27] <%MacabreOpus> Halo 3 is legendary
[0:27:28] <correctedsun117> I played 2 for hundreds of hours
[0:27:28] <alrobot2014> 3 coming to the MCC next tuesday
[0:27:29] <derap41> 14 July baby
[0:27:29] <%Goingchrisb3> i dont mind games that have a short campaign or main story but have unlocks for beating it multiple times and you get more stuff as you beat it like old resident evil games
[0:27:32] <VidulaSaix> I actually forgot a LOT of 3
[0:27:33] <spidervenomized> he can they switch between classic and remaster graphics
[0:27:35] <dabeaminator> 2 will always be my favorite
[0:27:35] <JoshuaLifts> WORT WORT WORT
[0:27:36] <%Nomad94> I played 2 so much
[0:27:37] <deadpoolking16> 3 is my favorite too
[0:27:37] <%hermitsen> 3 tied with reach for me
[0:27:38] <+yhom_tork> halo lore PogChamp
[0:27:39] <jasonisgold79> 3 is fun. But I haven't played it in a while tho.
[0:27:42] <%dinnydanny777> I read that Halo 2 was kind of rushed
[0:27:43] <%optimasmaximas> why tho
[0:27:44] <%subjectg> 2 was my first halo so i’ve got a lot of good vibes with this one
[0:27:44] <vulkan_vibes> 3 has incredible vehicle combat levels.
[0:27:46] <tanngnj0str> Watching the Halo LP made me salivate for like a linear FPS game with large levels and vehicles.
[0:27:47] <+phatmac16> WORT WORT WORT
[0:27:50] <Halospaz117> Admiral Cole is rad
[0:27:51] <+yhom_tork> absolutely
[0:27:51] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[0:27:52] <+HotBloodedHero> 2 is the most nostalgic, as much as Reach. I never got 3
[0:27:52] <+Bluemanzee> 3 is amazing but I also really like the Reach campaign
[0:27:55] <%RioGascar> 3 is my favorite yeah
[0:27:55] <%Nomad94> Cool cool
[0:27:58] <IndoorSitup> Does Little V know that playing Halo 2 in co op skips intro cutscenes?
[0:28:00] <BigDadBiggerDong> Wort time
[0:28:00] <%MacabreOpus> Spent many many afteroons in Forge mode
[0:28:02] <+DappercatEsquire> Yeah, preventing the Covenant from discovering Earth's location isn't really highlighted much in Halo 1
[0:28:07] <sniffy77> cole nuked a gas giant and made it turn into a star. scientifically this is bullshit but rule of cool
[0:28:08] <%CptnCampy61> Reach is my personal favorite
[0:28:08] <spidervenomized> reach favorite
[0:28:10] <%M3djedx> psaCanada
[0:28:10] <+mf_doomfist98> 2 is my favorite
[0:28:10] <xxshadowxx416> halo odst best
[0:28:10] <+HotBloodedHero> I'll finally get 3 next week tho
[0:28:10] <Catpurrple> Keyes mentions to use the Cole Protocol (getting cortana off the PoA) at the start of CE, but he doesn't explain what it meant.
[0:28:10] <correctedsun117> It's super important and never brought up, it sucks
[0:28:11] <MutedMimic> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:28:17] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> The covenant can never find out about earth Kappa
[0:28:17] <+Juriasu> it's the explanation for why the covenant didn't just blitz earth first thing, until now
[0:28:18] <+phatmac16> Halo 2’s campaign is the most memorable to me
[0:28:19] <Shardlab> The Covenant can never know where Earth is. They glass planets when they lose on the ground.
[0:28:19] <%Slimshazbot> Nakey Jakey is THE MAN
[0:28:20] <%Goingchrisb3> halo 2 is the most quoatable in the series for me, you can recount all the speaches and moments
[0:28:21] <ZeeJiggle> Yo nakeyjakey's pretty rad.
[0:28:21] <thesoddenknight> are you guys gonna watch any of the CE terminals retroactively?
[0:28:24] <+mf_doomfist98> ODST is super underrated though
[0:28:31] <Halospaz117> Harvest is first contact btw
[0:28:33] <Shardlab> They plasma scorch your worlds
[0:28:34] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @QueequegTheater

[0:28:36] <+yhom_tork> SourPls
[0:28:38] <%subjectg> @dinnydanny777 halo 2 was super rushed, they had to scrap a lot mid-development due to switching to a new engine
[0:28:39] <dabeaminator> Never forget that Johnson made first contact

[0:28:49] <Tucker0603> I love all the games through reach and 4
[0:28:50] <sniffy77> Fun Fact: Joseph Staten ended Contact Harvest with Johnson getting laid.
[0:28:54] <$Quiet__Viking> Cheer500 glad to see you play halo, there is a cutscene in 2 you should definitely not talk during. V would know it as the "there is much talk" cutscene
[0:28:56] <$Quiet__Viking> Quiet__Viking's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[0:29:00] <+BlackSunEmperor> @WoolieVersus Hey guys, either of you ever heard of The Culture sci fi book series? lots of direct influence on halo, from the rings to the ai personality. The books are great
[0:29:02] <IndoorSitup> Does Little V know that playing Halo 2 in co op skips intro cutscenes??
[0:29:05] <derap41> I want my Brute GF
[0:29:07] <Shardlab> Think of what would happen if they find our homeworld. Hence the Cole protocol
[0:29:15] <Catpurrple> Good, then they know.
[0:29:18] <%Nomad94> @IndoorSitup there you go.
[0:29:23] <korth367> ZERO chill
[0:29:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> Halo 2 Legendary is brutally unfair, but memorable.
[0:29:23] <%optimasmaximas> @sniffy77 read that as stalin LUL
[0:29:25] <%Slimshazbot> My Personal take: Halo 1 is the most nostalgic, Halo 2 has the best campaign, Halo 3 has the bet multiplayer, Halo: Reach has the best community features, Halo 3: ODST has the best tone
[0:29:26] <%Nomad94> Not again

[0:33:16] <Halospaz117> Here's a selling point, Morrigan hot
[0:33:18] <%optimasmaximas> CAUSE NO ONE HAS MADE A DWARVEN CITY NEXT TO A RIVER LAVA BEFORE RIGHT?!
[0:33:20] <+BlackSunEmperor> dwarves are always undergound with molten shit
[0:33:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Still sounds pretty standard
[0:33:22] <tattleworm> what dwarves ACTUALLY used to be is super fascinating but you won't find that out until one of the dlcs in the third game
[0:33:23] <Orenjevel> DA is fun but boy does it go downhill as the series progressed
[0:33:24] <zocano> Didn't even explain the one cool thing about Dwarves in Dragon Age and instead lists everything generic about Dwarves ???????
[0:33:24] <BigDadBiggerDong> Dwarfs underground with lava! Very unique!
[0:33:24] <%dinnydanny777> Dude you can sell your sister into literal sex slavery in the first hour, it's amazing
[0:33:24] <dabeaminator> I kinda liked Inquisition I guess

[0:33:36] <%Goingchrisb3> cant wait for the Music in this playthrough, Marty is a god
[0:33:41] <+phatmac16> DA is great, but generic
[0:33:41] <%toffshelf55> Let me tell you about an ambitious RPG with very impressive graphics... RAID SHADOW LEGENDS
[0:33:42] <%subjectg> My selling point for Dragon Age is only for Origins, and it’s in the gameplay more than story
[0:33:44] <OldManDeckardCain> why talk about dwarves, woolie would obviously go for the mage LUL
[0:33:46] <+krispen_wa> imagine playing Dragon Age when DOA6 exists?
[0:33:47] <Catpurrple> Jade Empire
[0:33:48] <%optimasmaximas> @mechslayer71 divinity original sin 2?
[0:33:49] <%falconcrunchv2> MOMBASSA SUITE
[0:33:51] <%jiggy_snipe> look if you want to get Woolie into medieval fantasy, you gotta pull a Dark Souls
[0:33:53] <+Zyquux> "dwarves live underground" is severely underselling Dragon Age
[0:33:55] <niddron> has he played Witcher 3 yet? no he hasn't
[0:33:56] <+yhom_tork> jade empire 2 never PepeHands
[0:33:57] <tattleworm> dwarves used to be the autonomous immune system of giants, it's stupid cool
[0:34:00] <%mechslayer71> @optimasmaximas Yeah
[0:34:01] <Prince_Robot> baldurs gate lets play confirmed
[0:34:01] <DSD24> The gameplay is great in DA Origins
[0:34:02] <Orenjevel> Has Woolie ever played Nethack?
[0:34:03] <leroyslammin> DOS 2 is amazing. Lizard Wizard for life
[0:34:03] <VidulaSaix> Mass Effect one day would be a dream
[0:34:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Jade Empire Drunken MAster run when
[0:34:04] <pipboy344> GENESONG
[0:34:06] <IndoorSitup> Mass Effect is a MUCH better starting point
[0:34:07] <derap41> Dragon age is good but ints not like a top tier CRPG
[0:34:09] <Austin0096> An example of things knowing when to end was when the lead animator for first Gundam series was relieved that the show was cut down from a planned 52 episodes to 43 because he felt that once they hit the mid 30s the show had said all it had to say and they were beginning to pad it out.
[0:34:10] <dabeaminator> Lil V Mass Effect LP Lets go
[0:34:12] <%ringabal> Unless the dwarves are made of magma, what's the point of dwarves
[0:34:13] <pipboy344> GENESONG WOOLIE
[0:34:16] <%chll0ne> has woolie ever played nocturne Kappa
[0:34:17] <+McSoliace> Inquisition at least has a stand class but yeah pretty tame games
[0:34:17] <Hemmy99> I need a mass effect run in my life
[0:34:17] <+Ryu_R> all these people saying DA is generic probably think SF5 has a good art style LUL
[0:34:18] <+Zyquux> Mass Effect when tho
[0:34:21] <Catpurrple> Jade Empire doesn't get enough love so that deserves a little extra prioritizing. Dragon Age will still be there.
[0:34:24] <$QueequegTheater> YES
[0:34:24] <+phatmac16> Mass effect please
[0:34:24] <+xBolts4Lifex> YEYEYEYEYEYEY
[0:34:25] <CISphil> Oh yeah, Jade Empire otherwise known as "Ooof, that didn't age well" Empire
[0:34:25] <Halospaz117> Space Marine is THE SHIT
[0:34:26] <JetpackMcQuack> play math blaster whipREE
[0:34:26] <Meltgar> SPESS MARINE
[0:34:27] <%subjectg> Listen, if we’re gonna talk about non-derivative dwarves there’s the dwemer
[0:34:29] <+Kindan55> Woolie would hate dragon age. He should probably only play the more sorry based crpgs like torment.
[0:34:30] <rockethed1> SPAYCE MARINE
[0:34:30] <Halospaz117> IT HAS GLORY KILLS
[0:34:31] <Kiryurules> "I ain't that easy to kill" SMorc
[0:34:32] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus: Hey Little V. Which Halo game soundtrack do you like?

[0:34:39] <+krispen_wa> DAI is when the lore really only begins to pick up
[0:34:39] <DSD24> I'm playing Space Marine right now
[0:34:41] <+Kindan55> story*
[0:34:43] <derap41> Throw Woolie into Total War Warhammer just to scare him
[0:34:44] <+xBolts4Lifex> @thesoddenknight no
[0:34:44] <%hermitsen> 40k is basically 3rd person doom 2016
[0:34:46] <spidervenomized> FOR THE EMPEROR
[0:34:47] <+lioan515> ALIEN BEEEENS

[0:34:56] <Halospaz117> 5 is the problem
[0:34:56] <+phatmac16> SPPPPAAACEE MARRIINESSSS
[0:34:56] <ergheisu> 4 is okay.

[0:35:01] <%Deadpal> yep.
[0:35:02] <leroyslammin> If Woolie ever plays Divinity Original Sin 2 I will be a very happy person.
[0:35:03] <%Deadpal> there is.
[0:35:04] <%prime_name> 5 is the WORST at that
[0:35:05] <thetransagenda> no it doesnt????????
[0:35:07] <Tucker0603> MY FACE IS MY SHIELD
[0:35:10] <REGNIERx> Im sorry about my username lol
[0:35:15] <$QueequegTheater> Fall of Reach is so fucking hype
[0:35:16] <+Juriasu> the books are NOT necessary to enjoy the games at all
[0:35:17] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Without reading the books 4 confused the shit out of me and my friend when we played it
[0:35:17] <+ntfth> Even if you read nothing else, the Forerunner Trilogy by Greg Bear is absolutely amazing.
[0:35:22] <dabeaminator> Just stop after Reach
[0:35:23] <CISphil> Ignore the books
[0:35:25] <moronic94> the made animated movies for the lore
[0:35:26] <ergheisu> halo "everything but 4-5" is 10/10. halo 4 is an 8/10.
[0:35:27] <+D00msDayDan> 4 sucks even if you read the books
[0:35:27] <%alpacasintophats> 5 is the hard one
[0:35:28] <Floofiie> Not necessary for 4, but 5 is stupid at it
[0:35:29] <VidulaSaix> Okay chat stop, you're even spoiling names now
[0:35:29] <+Ancopro> yea same
[0:35:31] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus When are we getting salt party UNO:The Game Kappa

[0:35:33] <+yhom_tork> jj abrams strats
[0:35:33] <Halospaz117> My friend sent me a lot of the books, I gotta read through em at some point
[0:35:33] <marvel877> 4 still was MEH
[0:35:33] <%Firststrike_OW> You dont need the books
[0:35:33] <VidulaSaix> Just fucking stop recommending things
[0:35:34] <+magiclottie> @WoolieVersus Halo 5 is the one that uses all the extended universe stuff, not 4
[0:35:34] <OldManDeckardCain> playing warhammer is way less fun than pointing out all the things they stole from everyone LUL
[0:35:36] <%GrassCannon> Halo isn't Kingdom Hearts lol
[0:35:38] <+TheOneCalledRock> *cough
[0:35:40] <sniffy77> the books give you more context, but its not exactly needed
[0:35:40] <+phatmac16> ThEse chat messages are the worst
[0:35:43] <superc37> FUCK OFF 4 IS GREAT
[0:35:44] <+krispen_wa> 5 is when you actually need it. but 5 fucking sucks anyways
[0:35:46] <Tucker0603> 4 was ok, 5 sucks
[0:35:46] <BurdRightsActivist> Let them play ResidentSleeper
[0:35:48] <derap41> I Read The FUcking Books!

[0:35:49] <+Ryu_R> don't even play Reach
[0:35:49] <Floofiie> 4 story is goated
[0:35:50] <vulkan_vibes> 5 uses EU. Not 4.
[0:35:51] <%chll0ne> lol destiny
[0:35:51] <HereComestheChief> 4 is good
[0:35:54] <dabeaminator> Yeah that would be stupid if 343 did that huh.

[0:35:55] <+phatmac16> I want to bully all you nerds sending in messages
[0:35:56] <%subjectg> 4 is ok, story carries it a lot
[0:35:56] <%falconcrunchv2> 4 still made sense tho? 5 had issues out the ass tho.
[0:35:58] <+AriaMeloetta> Halo 5 requires you play Halo Spartan Ops from Halo 4
[0:35:59] <IndoorSitup> "Please play this game that I like so I can feel validated in liking it."
[0:35:59] <Halospaz117> fair
[0:35:59] <+yhom_tork> the cutcenes are god tier
[0:36:00] <Toastyrific> 4 is alright
[0:36:01] <phantalime> there IS much talk
[0:36:03] <+thatfig> Reach is the best
[0:36:05] <$QueequegTheater> 4 is good cowards
[0:36:08] <Catpurrple> I'm not big on the books, I'm good on just hte games.

[0:36:14] <+krispen_wa> JUST TALK defeated
[0:36:15] <%Nomad94> god why
[0:36:16] <%black_pariah> @WoolieVersus Halo 4 does not require reading other books, thats a bullshit narrative by bungie purists
[0:36:17] <Floofiie> noble hierarchs, please don't turn me into a marketable plushie
[0:36:17] <Tucker0603> 5 can suck a dick with it's lootbox shit
[0:36:19] <+Kindan55> The cutscenes set the bar way too high for layer games, haha
[0:36:20] <+magiclottie> Halo 5 requires, comics, books, podcasts and halo 4's side mode
[0:36:21] <leroyslammin> 4 was too melodramatic, and this is from a guy who's second favorite Halo is 3.
[0:36:21] <+phatmac16> Please play and like this game to validate my existence
[0:36:22] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Half of 4 is good.
[0:36:23] <%prime_name> These chat messages are all the thoughts I have that I don't say

[0:52:59] <Halospaz117> Is air conditioning in space just life support?
[0:53:02] <ergheisu> why does the remaster look like how I thought it looked like in classic
[0:53:13] <korth367> Remaster looks nice but they made a lot of places WAYY darker
[0:53:18] <%alpacasintophats> so much is changed visually and sound-wise between remastered and classic
[0:53:19] <biomegabear> these tutorial sections give me ASMR
[0:53:26] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur to be fair, lotta the faces for the marines in 3 looked a bit wack
[0:53:32] <%Gruhunchously> They had to sacrifice the air conditioning to make budget for the extra polish
[0:53:40] <Catpurrple> Better to fix now than fuck the whole recording

[0:54:08] <zocano> 4 years and still all done in one year
[0:54:14] <Melchior_the_Wise> and the devlopers were rushed
[0:54:15] <Halospaz117> This came with MCC i belive, was a bit selling point
[0:54:15] <$agoaj> Peter Moore has the release data tattooed to his body.
[0:54:16] <Catpurrple> And it was still put onto OG xbox, which forced them to change a lot of what they originally wanted just to fit in its old shitty circuitry.
[0:54:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Best 10th Birthday any kid could ask for
[0:54:21] <Halospaz117> *big
[0:54:22] <%Gruhunchously> Another sequel that came out in 2004 that was rushed out the door but is still cool.
[0:54:22] <%Lizard0TM> H2A is practically a remake
[0:54:23] <%EdenOfLove> From what I can see its like "HOly shit, people played this game with like NO BUDGET? okay, lets see what happens when we give them some money." Is that accurate
[0:54:26] <Djinnazz> @WoolieVersus Was it this one or Halo 3 that sold the Xbox360?
[0:54:29] <sniffy77> the original developement of this game was a shitshow

[0:54:31] <%paladinstarbuster> Halo 2 is out during the holy grail wat
[0:54:32] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> dont feel bad about changing to the original graphics. there's a ton of bad lighting in the remaster
[0:54:33] <%DomunDomunDomun> H2A is the best art style halo's had.

[1:11:49] <ZeeJiggle> @hdDorrein Anime exclusive, yup.
[1:11:52] <+phatmac16> SO FULL OF NOSTALGIA
[1:11:55] <%RioGascar> Battle rifle crew
[1:11:56] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Battle Rifle Kun
[1:12:03] <marisot_lemonade> tag team the covenant bois
[1:12:05] <+o_almighty_1> “The recoil” bro what recoil 😂
[1:12:06] <%generalve> see this is why heroic sucks. you don't feel like a badass Spartan
[1:12:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> BR is great. I prefer the carbine.
[1:12:13] <+therabbles> woolie killing everyone and the walls
[1:12:14] <Halospaz117> Also if the gun runs out and auto reloads
[1:12:17] <dabeaminator> Doesn't LB reload the left gun?
[1:12:22] <R3c0n31> Alot of weapons did get buffs, they hit pretty hard
[1:12:36] <%hdDorrein> Ah the replay value. I see the vision, ty ty.
[1:12:39] <Halospaz117> @dabeaminator nope
[1:12:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> Why are there scenic atriums with palm trees on a giant floating gun
[1:12:47] <+yhom_tork> I love putting the skull where grunts explode when they die
[1:12:47] <Noble_Nobunaga > Infinite better bring back dual wielding
[1:12:49] <Goraka91> Remember how Grunts are almost human sized?
[1:12:57] <%RioGascar> @liquiddinosaur AESTHETIC
[1:12:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1280384800575152129
[1:12:59] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @themilhouseexperience Carbine’s shooting sound effect is so satisfying
[1:13:08] <%RioGascar> Also liven up the place
[1:13:11] <+Ancopro> buyt you could just pick it back up
[1:13:11] <unclekulikov> try the melee now!
[1:13:11] <Profmcstevie> You can't windmill it dual wielding.....sadly LUL
[1:13:12] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur gotta have some class to your fingers of god
[1:13:14] <Halospaz117> Yeah dual wielding is more situational than a permanent ficture
[1:13:16] <%Gruhunchously> Ka-Thump
[1:13:22] <StebTheVee> they combine reticles
[1:13:24] <$QueequegTheater> Ka-Thump
[1:13:24] <marisot_lemonade> loving those small controlled fires in the corner
[1:13:36] <DasFreekman> God we gotta teach him to bxr
[1:13:37] <+yhom_tork> more for close quarters
[1:13:37] <Floofiie> this room monkaS
[1:13:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Goraka91 Wait are they 5 feet tall or is that just with the gas tank? Either way, regardless of their height they will FUCK YOU UP. Like in a unarmed 1 on 1 fight a grunt would destroy a human being
[1:13:44] <+Lionhart16> @noble_nobunaga I wouldn't mind it back, but I think they got rid of it in the first place because it was so unbalanced.
[1:13:46] <marvel877> Dual wielding only good in tight maps in multiplayer.
[1:13:47] <GodlyLuigi> havent not played it, does anyone know if MCC halo 2 retains stuff like bxr?
[1:13:47] <+yhom_tork> this room has given me ptsd monkaS
[1:13:51] <alrobot2014> they will flank you as well
[1:13:57] <swolradguy> It’s the stage from DOA4
[1:14:01] <+OmenTribe> Did he teach you the double shot and the B x R
[1:14:14] <Goraka91> @LiquidDinosaur Yeah the aliens are huge, Chief is just a giant super soldier so they appear small
[1:14:19] <dabeaminator> Love that recharge sound
[1:14:21] <poooflingerz> Seeing woolies reaction to dual weapons made me smile
[1:14:21] <zamzoph> wow, the guns take up SO much screen space
[1:14:22] <%RioGascar> The AI in this game are so fun
[1:14:26] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:14:27] <biomegabear> yeah

[1:14:49] <liphttam1> I think easy is the true halo experience personally. Just judging by master chiefs power level in the books.
[1:14:50] <%RioGascar> the way each one plays off each other and reacts to your movements and thingg make it so funnnn

[1:15:25] <%Gruhunchously> Plasma Pistol baby
[1:15:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BlackSunEmperor i mean, ignore the fact that you're in space so there would be no shockwave
[1:15:29] <+Dionman19> the devs said the game was made for heroic
[1:15:34] <+thoughtlock> it's not gatekeeping, it's bungies intended difficulty

[1:15:46] <TrollKing96> Remember when the Battle Rifle was Semi-Auto in that E3 demo?
[1:15:48] <sniffy77> plasma pistol charge doesn't do damage though I think in this, its just damage against shields
[1:15:49] <marisot_lemonade> fleet admiral telling you to hurry LUL
[1:15:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dionman19 the Heroic mode option says the game was made for heroic
[1:15:55] <Catpurrple> I love the mixed reticles
[1:16:00] <zamzoph> Why is the top of the game screen cut off?

[1:16:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @sniffy77 okay yeah i thought i remembered that. I remember emptying an entire plasma pistol at a single grunt with overcharges and it didnt hurt them at all
[1:16:25] <GodlyLuigi> turret rip was 3

[1:23:54] <daveontheupside> V, please teach him how to use the BR
[1:23:58] <+informedotaku> that ain't gonna work
[1:24:01] <%Firststrike_OW> Yeah was 3 onwards
[1:24:01] <poisin224> woolie thats not a sniper rifle
[1:24:01] <%brambobelurkin> wait can't you pick up mounted guns in 2?
[1:24:07] <%raven_frame> I really like Halo 2 for the narrative, however I prefer the weapon balance in CE and being more beefy on higher difficulties.
[1:24:08] <%Slimshazbot> @Reizie_Etherealm Muuuch closer range
[1:24:09] <%brambobelurkin> Ahh 3 damn memory
[1:24:09] <drewofthedew> shotgun at range again, lovely haha
[1:24:10] <+D00msDayDan> woolie picks up a shotgun and forgets reloading exists
[1:24:12] <korth367> using shotgun from that far sbfpMember
[1:24:16] <+Zyquux> We need a control scheme tier list from V. Bumper Jumper better be at the top
[1:24:22] <superc37> yeah
[1:24:26] <+Ancopro> same yea
[1:24:27] <TheChucklingOak> close one
[1:24:28] <mujahideenfruityrebels> I think 2’s shottie’s range was nerfed
[1:24:29] <superc37> 1 had that as well
[1:24:30] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Bumper Jumper or nothing
[1:24:30] <%RunningNGunning> They function the same
[1:24:31] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[1:24:32] <%GoogleyGareth> different animation same damage

[1:24:37] <marvel877> same effect, different animations
[1:24:37] <VidulaSaix> Woolie its a shotgun not a sniper rifle LUL
[1:24:39] <+Bluemanzee> Always a bummer when games turn shotguns into glorified melee weapons
[1:24:41] <%brambobelurkin> @Zyquux idk man I prefer claw for the face button access
[1:24:43] <Goraka91> One isn't for crouching if that's what you're asking
[1:24:44] <%Cozy90> woolie thats a little far for the shotung lol
[1:24:44] <+DappercatEsquire> Woolie is really overestimating effective range for that shotty
[1:24:44] <$QueequegTheater> What even is effective range
[1:24:48] <RahuHordika> Shotgun is useless at range
[1:24:50] <vaderxyz1970> IN AMBER CLAD

[1:25:41] <%Solidnick18> space sound
[1:25:43] <%RioGascar> Game balance has to exist otherwise shotguns would rule all
[1:25:44] <Goraka91> Time to betray humanity I guess

[1:25:51] <Lazy355> Oh lordy lordy this is going to bother me.
[1:25:52] <armchairmaster_> @menitta then Doom 1 shotgun is your best friend
[1:25:53] <%Lizard0TM> Woolie would sellout humanity to the covenant for Jet Packs
[1:25:56] <dabeaminator> Range on the shotgun has been nerfed since CE
[1:25:56] <%Gruhunchously> Elites speak english now
[1:25:57] <%RioGascar> so gotta make shotguns “good for close quarters” only
[1:25:57] <%Firststrike_OW> Jet packs woolie is gonna switch sides

[1:26:06] <+thoughtlock> V please tell woolie about the shotgun range
[1:26:08] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Woolie, I know what you’re thinking
[1:26:11] <vaderxyz1970> IN AMBER CLAD
[1:26:12] <@Menitta> see this is why the Mastiff in Titanfall is fantastic
[1:26:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> I mean why can you hear anything
[1:26:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> it's space
[1:26:14] <%raven_frame> Doesn't she dual wield later too?
[1:26:15] <+informedotaku> shotgun range tho
[1:26:19] <drewofthedew> woolie, stop using the shotgun at range

[1:26:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> a BR would be really helpful here
[1:26:50] <%raven_frame> He's using the shotgun like a BR, it's true.
[1:26:52] <@Menitta> No because it sucks in apex Kappa

[1:27:09] <Buddha0991> yea but they only appear near the end

[1:27:12] <armchairmaster_> @huskarl_zap sssshhhhhhhh...
[1:27:13] <%alpacasintophats> I'm partial to dual SMG and plasma pistol and magnum
[1:27:15] <%raven_frame> But to be fair the range was way stronger in CE.
[1:27:17] <Gallhint> U...unatco?
[1:27:19] <Catpurrple> There's so much weird out of bounds looking shit when you start jumping onto rooves
[1:27:19] <%Lizard0TM> in fact some secrets require you to do so
[1:27:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie has a strong QA brain

[1:29:12] <+Ropcord> i think it's just because the pistol and the sniper rifle are the only guns that register headshots in 1?

[1:31:33] <TheChucklingOak> I love that the MAC guns are so good even the Covenant isn't able to properly defend from them
[1:31:44] <mujahideenfruityrebels> The hammer part doesn’t have collision if you glitch up to it
[1:31:45] <Lazy355> Does this track kills? I wanna see V's kill count.

[1:32:03] <correctedsun117> Calling it now, Woolie will NEVER fire the BR
[1:32:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> Imagine if they miss the shot, that projectile will travel across the galaxy to hit something
[1:32:05] <OpFork> Let’s see if they work lmaooo
[1:32:07] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Here we go...
[1:32:07] <+thoughtlock> "new gun" if only there was some sort of rifle he could take into battle
[1:32:08] <+D00msDayDan> i hope woolie sees the carrier fly past
[1:32:09] <%shoutofthehobo> oh for real
[1:32:12] <+GeneralHysterics> fuck around and find out
[1:32:23] <GameOver_Here> You only need 1 plas shot to pop a shield
[1:32:23] <+lupus_man> Woolies love for the dual wielding look will be the death
[1:32:26] <IndoorSitup> Place your bets, how long wi it be before Woolie FINALLY tries out the Battle Rifle?
[1:32:27] <%alpacasintophats> I'd try that battle rifle
[1:32:28] <Joestar1890> Good team comp
[1:32:33] <ralphfromdk> Thank god for little V LUL
[1:32:34] <BigDadBiggerDong> "What if you miss?" "I'll try not to miss"
[1:32:34] <marvel877> Woolie does know that holding the charge slowly drains it, right?
[1:32:36] <%LoganWulfric> Carrier be like "Ooo what's that down there though"
[1:32:39] <%Gruhunchously> Good comp, good comp
[1:32:43] <SirDogBear> woolie needs these purple and green pistols
[1:32:44] <OpFork> I love that V plays this like he’s playing with his little brother
[1:32:47] <Goraka91> Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space
[1:32:49] <armchairmaster_> Wait, has woolie NOT used the battle rifle yet?
[1:32:51] <Lazy355> I want to have V hang back and have woolie take on encounters on his own.
[1:32:55] <+thoughtlock> next level at earliest since it starts with one but I bet you 10:1 he drops it
[1:32:57] <GameOver_Here> Use the fucking noob combo, it's called as such for a reason

[1:33:07] <marvel877> No not yet.
[1:33:09] <Lazy355> Make the boy experience adversity
[1:33:10] <CrypticMochi> Were Brute Shot in 2? Cuz that and the BR were my favorites

[1:45:41] <%alpacasintophats> ODST is going to be a weird LP to do right.
[1:45:41] <haitakaa> 3 is a good mix of 1 and 2
[1:45:42] <Catpurrple> Only worth doing if you have a rocket launcher and really don't want it shooting you

[1:46:15] <GHouseduivel> @alpacasintophats More like Halo 1: Modern Warefare
[1:46:17] <haitakaa> odst had horde mode right

[2:57:37] <Kiryurules> SourPls
[2:57:41] <%iHum4n> Isn't this a remix of one of the songs from halo 1?
[2:57:42] <pookam> reminds me of Metroid Prime music
[2:57:49] <Speccu_> Grunts are just a different species with different brain structure. They have crazy intelligence when it comes to learning things like languages
[2:57:54] <+D00msDayDan> the original sounds so much better
[2:57:59] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Grunts are actually 1000 year old dragons, so it’s fine
[2:58:03] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Grunts Breed and mature extremely fast. That’s why the grunt rebellion needed an Arbiter.

[3:03:36] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie, you haven't used the sword in like 15 minutes
[3:03:36] <+condemned_15> KNOW WHAT I MEAN
[3:03:36] <+Ropcord> NO HONOR
[3:03:36] <Goraka91> Samurai rules
[3:03:38] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @burdrightsactivist That’s beside the point BibleThump
[3:03:39] <penitentpentwitch> Vergil instantly angry
[3:03:41] <+yhom_tork> elites are basically space samurai
[3:03:43] <%kingdovachief> YOOOOOOO HALO 2!!!
[3:03:46] <%black_pariah> WONT DROP HIS SHIELD EITHER
[3:03:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> SEE WHAT I MEAN?
[3:03:46] <%Lizard0TM> V, show woolie the sword draw animations!
[3:03:47] <%Slimshazbot> Drop your sword as often as Woolie drops his shield
[3:03:51] <Onatamana> Arbiter is allowed since he already has no honor
[3:03:57] <+whiskeybuisness> never drop your sword* *unless it runs out of ammo
[3:04:02] <Halospaz117> Cover your dick with teh sword
[3:04:04] <brachydios777> The sword is literally apart of Sangheili culture
[3:04:05] <Onatamana> you still shouldn't tho

[3:04:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> if they wanted you to never drop it, they'd put a bigger battery on it Kappa
[3:04:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> A samurai without his sword is not a samurai
[3:04:09] <%CursedNobleman> arraaraarawwrrr
[3:04:13] <leroyslammin> There was a Naked Arbiter mod if I remember correctly.
[3:04:21] <pookam> does Arbiter have the same shield/health as Chief?
[3:04:21] <Goraka91> Also, the Samurai never had honour to begin with, just posturing nobles like Knights
[3:04:23] <DSD24> Dual Needlers also means never get close to enemeies
[3:04:26] <%hattrick61> A man with no armor is naked, a man with no sword is crippled
[3:04:29] <biomegabear> I also dont like I dont have health
[3:04:32] <%ChoculaUltra> of course there's a nude Arbiter mod, its the internet
[3:04:32] <%kingdovachief> Don't drop your shield Woolie
[3:04:32] <leroyslammin> Every cutscene, every mission

[3:05:15] <Goraka91> @brachydios777 No, but they also don't have a word for ''killing the first person you see to test your new sword''

[3:08:02] <%Nomad94> Never heard of that
[3:08:03] <%kingdovachief> THIS SONG IS AWESOME
[3:08:03] <+Reverend_Roscoe> lol
[3:08:09] <+NocturnePsycho> the song is cool but it feels so weird in this part
[3:08:09] <%Solidnick18> ooooo
[3:08:13] <%Solidnick18> sweet
[3:08:13] <wibbwobbler> cool
[3:08:14] <ThatGuyThere03> FOLLOW
[3:08:17] <%ChoculaUltra> Follow in Flight, how poignant
[3:08:22] <Catpurrple> I vastly prefer the incubus and Breaking Benjamin songs, but the remake songs to replace them for legal reasons are totally fine.
[3:08:22] <+vaultzombie> Bungie firing Marty O'Donnel was a mistake
[3:08:22] <Pookiedaexzile> We dog fighting
[3:08:25] <zocano> Nah this isn't Follow unfortunately
[3:08:27] <Holycow8498> classic or HD because the orignal is by Incubus
[3:08:30] <+yhom_tork> yeah LuL
[3:08:33] <%TheOddJik> did they actually fire him?
[3:08:33] <+D00msDayDan> leave it on follow
[3:08:36] <%Solidnick18> djent is very odd
[3:08:36] <%alpacasintophats> classic is better
[3:08:39] <Halospaz117> I still prefer follow a bit
[3:08:42] <+phatmac16> classic is better
[3:08:43] <%astrofalcon1> yep time to djent
[3:08:49] <%DesDavis> it's so jarring
[3:08:54] <+yhom_tork> F
[3:08:56] <%Solidnick18> oh nooo
[3:08:58] <poisin224> you earned that lmao
[3:08:59] <%dinnydanny777> Wow that guy wrecked you
[3:09:01] <%astrofalcon1> rip
[3:09:02] <vaderxyz1970> Sounds Anime
[3:09:03] <%brambobelurkin> uh oh
[3:09:07] <%raven_frame> I think I prefer the original, I'm not sure.
[3:09:12] <Onatamana> wollie is kil
[3:09:14] <%doomerskeletor13> It does sound like an anime opening
[3:09:16] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Ok Woolie PunOko
[3:09:16] <+phatmac16> I prefer the original
[3:09:16] <Goraka91> They fired him during Destiny 1 yeah
[3:09:16] <torres_kun> Follow, follow, follow YEAAAAAAHHH EAHHHHHHEHHHH
[3:09:17] <OldOnyx> yeah, this song was even weirder here back in the day
[3:09:17] <%brambobelurkin> is it like the old 2 where you die and spawn in mid-air?
[3:09:18] <+Shotgundam009> Its cool but Follow is one of my favorite tracks from the original
[3:09:24] <%ChoculaUltra> speaking of Marty, he actually did an interview about the whole Destiny Activision deal and kind of alludes to why he was chill with parting ways with Bungo. Published on Bungie day too.
[3:09:24] <%BoondockJoker> this song's way better
[3:09:25] <drewofthedew> the banshee design here in the OG I feel is better than the new design
[3:09:27] <Holycow8498> Yeah i think i prefer the incubus song for this section
[3:09:28] <+einherjarvalk> the older Incubus song fits better imo
[3:09:29] <+BioHunter> i prefer a lot of the originals design
[3:09:31] <zocano> Follow (from the original) is way better
[3:09:31] <wibbwobbler> remaster did everything right
[3:09:32] <Louie_Salmon> Ayy fuel rod
[3:09:40] <+Ancopro> i prefer follow too
[3:09:41] <%Lizard0TM> I grew up with this type of metal so I fucking love this track
[3:09:43] <pookam> im waiting for the japanese vocals to drop
[3:09:48] <%NovaKnightmare> Luckyy
[3:09:50] <leroyslammin> Incubus and the other song that plays later were the best.
[3:09:51] <Bodski99> honestly prefer follow in classic but the new song is good too
[3:09:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> convenient
[3:09:52] <%thechungiestofbois> 2melo
[3:09:53] <+NocturnePsycho> This sounds more JRPG than Halo lmao
[3:09:54] <%Cozy90> i like this song :(
[3:09:59] <BurdRightsActivist> Classic had INCUBUS
[3:10:00] <+cursedwithadhd> Then Switch
[3:10:00] <+NocturnePsycho> still like it tho
[3:10:01] <duskrush> 2MELLO
[3:10:02] <Floofiie> Then go classic
[3:10:03] <PrideOfFiddles> Now it's starting to sound like a naruto op LUL
[3:10:03] <%Slimshazbot> I like this song, but Follow fit better
[3:10:04] <%alpacasintophats> didn't they swap or change up one of the songs since they couldn't get the rights to it?
[3:10:05] <+Fenrein> I love this song but it doesn't really fit here
[3:10:05] <OldManDeckardCain> still waiting for that KOWAHITAI
[3:10:06] <ThatGuyThere03> Switch back to classic for jams
[3:10:07] <$laphyrion> I LIKE BOTH
[3:10:08] <+phatmac16> switch to classic for some incubus lol
[3:10:10] <+yhom_tork> yeah it has very jrpg vibes
[3:10:10] <+thegreenbenis> Not digging this music tbh
[3:10:12] <%Doplghost> Is this an AMV?
[3:10:13] <%brambobelurkin> Maaaan I loooved Bnashees
[3:10:16] <Jrockoni> I still dont see the connection between the arbiter and ambient rock.
[3:10:20] <PleasantLeech> mellow rock
[3:10:20] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I got real familiar with a similar style metal with late Dream Theater and Scar Symmetry
[3:10:20] <Holycow8498> Its a nice song but incubus's follow is much better
[3:10:22] <+Odin_XIV> OG was Incubus
[3:10:22] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Classic track is better
[3:10:25] <leroyslammin> Follow was fast paced and awesome.
[3:10:26] <+VCRUZZO> it is a bit too mellow
[3:10:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah they couldn’t get the license for the original song
[3:10:34] <wibbwobbler> prog rock
[3:10:34] <+phatmac16> classic track is awesome
[3:10:39] <+thegreenbenis> Would much rather it just be Halo music.
[3:10:41] <Pookiedaexzile> I was waiting for the anime girl voice to come in
[3:10:42] <+yhom_tork> thats so good
[3:10:45] <%hattrick61> SSS
[3:10:46] <VidulaSaix> I think it has a boost as well
[3:10:49] <+Shotgundam009> H2 easily best banshee movement like its not even close
[3:10:51] <%dinnydanny777> It's Arwing maneuvers
[3:10:51] <jamesthebrave> You should have been seeing the friends that the Arbiter made along the way giving a friendship speech with that track
[3:10:55] <Goraka91> Music licences and the industry in general suuuuck
[3:11:00] <+whiskeybuisness> @Pookiedaexzile I was waiting for Screamo-Man
[3:11:01] <KernelButter> I don't think either of the songs really fit this moment, tbh
[3:11:04] <+DappercatEsquire> Better in less time
[3:11:05] <OldManDeckardCain> DO A SPIN
[3:11:13] <XdaXcaptainX> tfw he basically ignored the classic music :(
[3:11:15] <Louie_Salmon> Do a boost and a trick together. Unless that's a Halo 3 thing
[3:11:18] <Pookiedaexzile> @whiskeybuisness Nah nah thats the mid song breakdown
[3:11:19] <Reizie_Etherealm> God damn, what a barrage
[3:11:20] <%gunslinger_xxiv> ROLL
[3:11:25] <duskrush> Use the boost to get through
[3:11:26] <%dinnydanny777> That one Banshee pilot is wracking up some kills
[3:11:26] <%alpacasintophats> banshees are paper thin in this and in 3
[3:11:27] <korth367> woolie with the relflexes of a sloth
[3:11:31] <%dinnydanny777> What a pilot
[3:11:32] <%stemlo_> @XdaXcaptainX it sisnt in the game
[3:11:38] <%brambobelurkin> they had woolie dead to rights
[3:11:40] <%alpacasintophats> you can easily kill them with automatic weapons fire
[3:11:41] <huskarl_zap> nice power metal song
[3:11:43] <%dinnydanny777> Is that Banshee Star Wolf?
[3:11:43] <Onatamana> the instant you see hits coming in from behind, you HAVE to react
[3:11:46] <XdaXcaptainX> its not? shit, how lame
[3:11:47] <Holycow8498> V do they still have the skulls in anniversary? because there should be a skull you can find on this part?
[3:11:50] <OldManDeckardCain> it's ok guys, in rollback woolie wouldn't die Kappa
[3:12:04] <spire6> Covie PORPLE
[3:12:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Mango Ghost
[3:12:10] <GodKingReiss> Skulls only appear in Halo 2 on Legendary
[3:12:21] <Joestar1890> Manghost
[3:12:23] <Jrockoni> would have much rather they just made up some covenant styled music for that sequence.

[3:12:32] <%ChoculaUltra> lighting in the world of food photography is wiiiiiiild
[3:12:35] <Tisaric> lighting is so important and people don't realize it
[3:12:35] <Goraka91> I'm a sucker for good bump and specular maps
[3:12:38] <%dinnydanny777> Sick dodges
[3:12:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Art period, light is everything
[3:12:45] <Catpurrple> That's why RTX is a big in thing right now, because it's the tech for making lighting better, among many other things.
[3:12:45] <wibbwobbler> great lighting ages well
[3:12:48] <+krispen_wa> That's why you can have shitty textures in Skyrim but just install an ENB and make it look AMAZING
[3:12:49] <rothgarbloodfire> i never noticed but these banshees are rusty buckets
[3:12:51] <mujahideenfruityrebels> It’s a World of Light
[3:12:55] <Targical> It often gives a major difference in feel here
[3:13:07] <Tisaric> if you don't have light you don't have a picture period
[3:13:14] <MisterSaintly> HERE WE GO x2
[3:13:17] <Joestar1890> This level needs to be in classic
[3:13:23] <%dinnydanny777> Also lighting is not just bright light, bright light ruins photographs
[3:13:24] <Catpurrple> On the other hand, Halo 1 anniversary's lighting was too bright across the board.
[3:13:25] <+gitgouda> oh cool working on halo 2 now?

[3:14:27] <Lazy355> @Catpurrple they used the beta version for the pc release to create the anniversary. That's why it looks so bleck.
[3:14:29] <%dinnydanny777> I see a problem
[3:14:29] <+Saiyanfox10> is that a flood tank?

[3:14:35] <+phatmac16> THEY BACK
[3:14:36] <leroyslammin> I actually like this part a bit more in classic because the beginning becomes too obvious. You can see em too clearly
[3:14:48] <Pookiedaexzile> IT's Dem boys
[3:14:52] <Goraka91> monkaS
[3:14:53] <huskarl_zap> Also this whole two levels are way creepier in classic
[3:14:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> WHat could have happened?
[3:14:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> @leroyslammin i mean in the first room that tank has infection forms
[3:14:58] <Joestar1890> Sword is your friend
[3:14:59] <%dinnydanny777> Are those bodies different in Classic?
[3:14:59] <Onatamana> rip grunts
[3:15:00] <Catpurrple> @Lazy355 I know, but it's still just a fuckup across the board of the style of the game. Whereas this one's is great.

[3:17:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> SLOW ASS ELEVATOR
[3:17:17] <%subjectg> Welcome to the hellevator
[3:17:17] <+Ropcord> @shutupandjam3465 better twitch tv, it's a browser extension that adds stuff to twitch
[3:17:17] <Lazy355> Tunnel vision
[3:17:19] <mujahideenfruityrebels> At least blow off the arms
[3:17:20] <%doomerskeletor13> @shutupandjam3465 Better Twitch Tv, it’s an extension
[3:17:22] <alrobot2014> this fucking elevator
[3:17:24] <rosemon5001> this music thooo
[3:17:25] <leroyslammin> I feel like Pat would survive a Flood infection.
[3:17:26] <Catpurrple> When will woolie fall off this elevator?
[3:17:27] <+DappercatEsquire> I thought this was a mining installation or some shit
[3:17:31] <+Jaysky> These levels freaked me out when I was younger
[3:17:34] <%shutupandjam3465> oh ok cool thanks!
[3:17:36] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Plasma weapons and sentinel beams are real good
[3:17:36] <Goraka91> @shutupandjam3465 If you've even seen something like Clap SourPls or monkaS it's one of those emotes
[3:17:38] <coracor> the head is the infestation form sitting in their chest
[3:17:40] <%PadreHail> Pat can barely survive the toilet
[3:17:43] <+krispen_wa> wow classic looks LESS spooky

[3:17:59] <+yhom_tork> they call their grenades "holy flar" lmao
[3:18:29] <leroyslammin> I love the covenant aliens in Halo. They're the most interesting aliens I've seen in a while.
[3:18:30] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Classic carbine is so good.
[3:18:36] <leroyslammin> Also Elites are Rad
[3:18:39] <kulmoth> they made the lighting better but visibility and mood went down for it
[3:18:40] <JetpackMcQuack> FeelsBadMan wait up guys
[3:18:43] <%dinnydanny777> They're crawling up the walls
[3:19:11] <Goraka91> @leroyslammin They're alright, games are always good when the enemy is interesting
[3:19:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Are we the baddies?
[3:19:14] <+DappercatEsquire> purpose built
[3:19:32] <Bguy32> classic is way brighter than I remember
[3:19:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:19:39] <Reizie_Etherealm> If sentinel beam is class 12, and the UNSC weapons are class 2, what would the covenant weapons be?
[3:19:54] <+Ropcord> melee if you have a brute shot or a sword tho
[3:20:02] <Hammatime8> The modern graphics kill the atmosphere a little
[3:20:08] <$QueequegTheater> @Reizie_Etherealm I assume around the 3-5 range
[3:20:14] <hkgamingtv> beam sword BEST weapon
[3:20:29] <Bguy32> The Modern Graphics are way more atmospheric but Classic is way brighter
[3:20:32] <Joestar1890> @Reizie_Etherealm Class 5 maybe?
[3:20:35] <CrypticMochi> I realize my melee habits came from the brute shot
[3:20:37] <%dinnydanny777> The beamsword literally cut one in half, that melee seems to work at least
[3:20:37] <+andyfutrell> why does wooile keep switching graphics it is kind messing with my eyes
[3:20:39] <+Fenrein> Halo 2 classic gives me Ergo Proxy vibes sometimes
[3:20:56] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie conditioned for alien racism
[3:21:12] <leroyslammin> I kinda prefer classic, but that's mostly a Halo 1 Anniversary thing than a Halo 2 thing.
[3:21:30] <leroyslammin> It's also a nostalgia factor
[3:21:41] <%alpacasintophats> you'd probably still have grunts on normal
[3:21:41] <Onatamana> disposing of the corpses properly
[3:21:42] <KernelButter> Your elites will mess the flood up if you give them a sword
[3:21:42] <StarlitStunner> Ergo Proxy is great, Mayer is best girl @attackofthesage
[3:21:54] <Reizie_Etherealm> @QueequegTheater That's a lot of disparity, I figured since both covenant and forerunner are energy based maybe they're closer together. Plasma and laser, they both burn tissue unlike bullets.
[3:21:55] <+phatmac16> try out the lazer Woolie
[3:21:58] <%alpacasintophats> hell I have difficulty keeping the elites to here on heroic
[3:21:59] <Onatamana> double tapping flood is allowed
[3:22:29] <drewslo> forerunner weapons are hard light based
[3:22:29] <Talinu> co-op also makes it much easier than it would otherwise be.
[3:22:31] <%dinnydanny777> Just shoot the flood until they die
[3:22:40] <leroyslammin> "We're Elites sir, we're expendable." "Not to me."
[3:22:43] <penitentpentwitch> Center of mass
[3:23:00] <Joestar1890> @leroyslammin That's me with my Grunts
[3:23:10] <drewslo> the sentinel beam is less a weapon and more a sanitation tool
[3:23:11] <+yhom_tork> god I wish there were in game subtitles
[3:23:18] <leroyslammin> Hell yeah @joestar1890
[3:23:21] <+condemned_15> the texas rattlesnake
[3:23:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> What did the elite just say?
[3:23:23] <dellis80> just got here. is there dual wielding????
[3:23:35] <+YabbaTroll> thats just the model though
[3:23:37] <%Tuna_Can_0> WutFace
[3:23:38] <korth367> some are human some are grunts
[3:23:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> Combat Forms become Carrier Forms
[3:23:39] <%prime_name> I guess Grunts are just ignored?
[3:23:40] <zashrin777> @drewslo Laser mop
[3:23:41] <+YabbaTroll> theres no humans here for them to get
[3:23:42] <%shutupandjam3465> @dellis80 hell yeah
[3:23:45] <+Deano8817> @dellis80 yeah
[3:23:46] <%alpacasintophats> it goes to combat form and then carrier form after a hot minute being infected
[3:23:48] <Joestar1890> Grunts are surpirsingly immune, IN GAME.
[3:23:54] <+yhom_tork> yeyeye
[3:23:54] <%Slimshazbot> Grunts DO get made into carriers in Lore
[3:23:55] <Sundaysmiles01> they just didnt update the models to consider it
[3:23:56] <+whiskeybuisness> no! armless friend!
[3:23:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @prime_name they can mush them up into meat but they dont bother making them combat Forms no
[3:24:00] <%DomunDomunDomun> They're anything that isn't good enough to be a combat form.
[3:24:01] <wibbwobbler> human legs?
[3:24:02] <Sundaysmiles01> error?
[3:24:02] <marvel877> Now do that shit in multiplayer
[3:24:03] <%Tearonex> the flood doesn't bother with the grunt becuse they're too weak
[3:24:03] <dellis80> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp SeemsGood PowerUpR KomodoHype PowerUpL
[3:24:04] <+krispen_wa> STINGER INERTIA
[3:24:05] <Saffry_Ruzin> Carrier forms are anything that can't be used as a Combat form, not just human
[3:24:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> Lunge = jank
[3:24:07] <Holycow8498> I always thought carrier forms were more so natural states of the flood like the infection forms
[3:24:07] <Catpurrple> I used to think it was that way because of the proportions, but yeah, it's never been grunts. They reject them, use them for random extra biomass sometimes but no actual forms.
[3:24:08] <brachydios777> The shell makes it hard for flood to get to the nervous system
[3:24:11] <%2hutown> That momentum killed me so many times
[3:24:15] <darkbrightdemon> grants are just for mass

[3:24:47] <dellis80> oh, this is the OG Halo 2, nvm
[3:24:50] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> V you should sho Woolie how to sword cancel
[3:24:54] <MisterSaintly> Carrier Forms come from bodies too damage to become Combat Forms, and the extra biomass to make them can come from Grunts and Jackals
[3:24:55] <Joestar1890> I love the dash
[3:24:57] <Sundaysmiles01> Dont forget to use your Stealth Woolie
[3:24:57] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Woolie, you’re flying too close to the sun
[3:25:00] <OldManDeckardCain> all just an accident, just like kreia Kappa
[3:25:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Holycow8498 the lifecycle is infection form gets into you, and starts turning you into an incubator for more infection forms, and while its doing that it uses you to kill other people for more things to infect
[3:25:22] <%astrofalcon1> yeah don't
[3:25:23] <%shutupandjam3465> @dellis80 its the anniversary

[3:26:01] <%doomerskeletor13> Ok Boomers
[3:26:03] <leroyslammin> I still confuse the Shoryuken for the Hadouken to this day
[3:26:03] <%stemlo_> What enemy says "boom" like woolie does?
[3:26:07] <%raven_frame> This terminal is hype, it super confirms something if it's the one I'm thinking of.
[3:26:08] <Onatamana> not converted yet
[3:26:11] <korth367> those HAVE to be grunts because there are no humans around
[3:26:11] <penitentpentwitch> "Boomer here!" "Where's your manager!?" "Oh no! It's a Karen!"
[3:26:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> ......so far
[3:26:16] <+DappercatEsquire> Boomers as an enemy name has been retroactively made funny, so thanks for that 2020

[3:27:03] <leroyslammin> Who says the flood can't just make human adjacent forms after eating so many?
[3:27:04] <+YabbaTroll> nah they blow up in this one
[3:27:06] <Catpurrple> I think they blow up when they're armless after a certain amount of time.

[3:27:17] <$QueequegTheater> Do not stick the Flood

[3:27:29] <+yhom_tork> this room sucks
[3:27:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> He swung so fast the sword didn't even activate yet LUL
[3:27:35] <zashrin777> Armless ones ditch the body and become an infection form again, yeah?

[3:27:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Just look at the design on the Carbine

[3:45:04] <Lazy355> It's not what your brain knows, its what it DOESNT know Woolie.
[3:45:05] <%dekkitout> It's more of the disappointment that that's the frame of reference
[3:45:06] <Catpurrple> It's only bad when it's like saying new game stole from old game, because then it's negative.
[3:45:07] <DigitalJoshie> woolie how dare you compare things to what you have experienced you should compare them from mine Kappa

[4:00:12] <+lupus_man> Yeah it’s probably smart to let V filter donation messages to decide what you should and shouldn’t hear
[4:00:15] <Catpurrple> Ah well, at least it'll work fine next session
[4:00:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie, let V screen the sub messages before you read them.
[4:00:16] <leroyslammin> Can Woolie make it in the trenches of Halo Matchmaking?
[4:00:19] <sircool099> did V explain that the scarab is a giant hunter and is technically an infantry unit?
[4:00:23] <mesamus> LET V READ MESSAGES
[4:00:23] <+andyfutrell> halo 3 was the first one I played and the only other ones I played were 4 and reach and
[4:00:28] <mujahideenfruityrebels> What’s wrong with the donations, did people say swear words? cmonBruh
[4:00:32] <dabeaminator> As long as you keep reading the bad donations and giving them attention they aren't gonna go away
[4:00:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @sircool099 i think that's only in halo 3 on, here tis one is just a robot
[4:00:33] <mesamus> WOOLIE STAY BACK FROM US
[4:00:38] <leroyslammin> I played em all in order except 5.
[4:00:44] <OverlordLuna> PogChamp
[4:00:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> I stopped after 3.
[4:00:59] <%Nomad94> @CommanderSqueaks Aw man, you missed out on Reach and 4
[4:01:01] <hkgamingtv> I'm glad you're enjoying it woolie
[4:01:01] <mesamus> V FILTER FOR WOOLIE PLEASE
[4:01:05] <heartlesshealer> @mujahideenfruityrebels It's a pathway for people to force spoilers onto Woolie
[4:01:06] <SGrim> @CommanderSqueaks you've missed nothing
[4:01:07] <%subjectg> yelling about stinky chat members is honestly more annoying than the problem itself, you know
[4:01:09] <%RunningNGunning> Because they hired BLUR
[4:01:10] <FunkyStreams> money
[4:01:10] <+krispen_wa> BLUR
[4:01:11] <BurdRightsActivist> halo 1 cutscenes are in-engine
[4:01:11] <Klefth> People must be spoiling the shit out of everything in donations. Wtf...
[4:01:11] <%Gruhunchously> Blur Studios
[4:01:12] <sircool099> 2 was more hype than 1
[4:01:12] <dabeaminator> The studio is Blur
[4:01:13] <leroyslammin> I stopped after 4, didn't like the designs in it. Chief's armor looked awful in 4.
[4:01:13] <zashrin777> Blur studio made these cutscenes
[4:01:15] <%MacabreOpus> Blur Studio did the Halo 2
[4:01:15] <%Firststrike_OW> Its blur
[4:01:18] <wibbwobbler> halo 2 is unique
[4:01:19] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @heartlesshealer Ah...
[4:01:21] <Bodski99> I’m thrilled you liked it woolie!
[4:01:24] <Mr_Taters > Yeah they hired Blur to do pure CG vs in engine
[4:01:24] <%MacabreOpus> Deadpool team
[4:01:29] <huskarl_zap> we done?
[4:01:32] <zashrin777> They also did halo wars and shadow the hedgehog
[4:01:34] <+whiskeybuisness> didn't they also do halo 5 cutscenes like that too?
[4:01:36] <donstylo> Wasn't Saber Interactive also involved in the MCC?
[4:01:40] <%Slimshazbot> Halo 1: Anniversary was kinda of a slap job, 2 got much more attention
[4:01:43] <kombatk117> V mic low
[4:01:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1280384800575152129
[4:01:44] <+AriaMeloetta> They hired Blur
[4:01:45] <mesamus> woolie stop reading chat! let V filter us out
[4:01:49] <drewslo> same cutscene studio as halo wars
[4:01:52] <geassguy360> check out the rebalance, 2 was rushed out and its balance is kinda borked, especially in legendary
[4:01:56] <%Slimshazbot> The original was totally in engine
[4:01:56] <+Ancopro> and it would lead to HILARIOUS pop in
[4:01:57] <%subjectg> Halo Wars 1 was the first blur project and it looks great
[4:02:09] <wibbwobbler> wished 1 and 3 got the same treatment
[4:02:12] <%BoondockJoker> blur came in when they came out with halo wars 1. they then tasked them to do the halo 2 cutscenes. halo 1 remaster were in engine
[4:02:14] <dailylifewithry> Halo 2 is also arguably more loved than Halo CE. It’s like Empires Strikes Back that way
[4:02:16] <%gatorafan> We jumped from Super Mario 64 to Galaxy
[4:02:18] <dabeaminator> Didn't Blur only come on after Halo Wars 2?
[4:02:22] <Pnutz409> original was in engine and rendering sometimes never happened
[4:02:25] <Onatamana> glitch cutscene deaths are great
[4:02:42] <%RunningNGunning> Blur knows how to do CGI
[4:02:44] <geassguy360> I want CE and 3 done by blur for reeeeeaaaaal
[4:02:44] <+krispen_wa> Has BLUR ever made a bad animation?
[4:02:48] <Halospaz117> To be fair, CE anniversary was still on 360
[4:02:56] <danielmorn> Halo 2s cutscenes are so good
[4:02:59] <%Slimshazbot> The H2A cutscene are gorgeous, but I always kinda prefer in-engine. The massive graphical difference to gameplay and cutscene always pulls me out of the game
[4:03:00] <+whiskeybuisness> and then woolie will be disappointed to go back to halo 3
[4:03:02] <wibbwobbler> blur earned their rep
[4:03:02] <RahuHordika> Nooooope
[4:03:03] <hkgamingtv> NO
[4:03:03] <%RunningNGunning> Halo 3 has no remastering
[4:03:04] <%subjectg> Blur does great work, but the pacing and line editing in the new cutscenes is off
[4:03:04] <DigitalJoshie> nope
[4:03:04] <FiendishlyInventive> No.
[4:03:04] <%BoondockJoker> they haven't done 3 yet
[4:03:05] <%Slimshazbot> No 3 is all inegine
[4:03:05] <dabeaminator> No
[4:03:05] <%Lizard0TM> no
[4:03:05] <+phatmac16> nope
[4:03:06] <%alpacasintophats> they have not done it
[4:03:07] <+D00msDayDan> 3 is all in-engine, just uprezzed for mcc
[4:03:07] <+Fenrein> They have not
[4:03:07] <%Firststrike_OW> They are not
[4:03:07] <prince_johnny_> no
[4:03:08] <@Menitta> 3 never got anything
[4:03:08] <DeathByPoke7> 3 is not getting a remaster
[4:03:09] <Goraka91> 3 is just 3
[4:03:09] <+AriaMeloetta> We CE A was on 360
[4:03:10] <+phatmac16> Halo 3 holds up
[4:03:11] <zashrin777> no, unfortunately
[4:03:12] <+NocturnePsycho> never remastered 3
[4:03:12] <Halospaz117> Halo 3 is just Halo 3
[4:03:13] <DinoBear_7> This is the last remaster
[4:03:13] <Catpurrple> They upscaled some textures, but it's gonna be almost the same as the original
[4:03:14] <%alpacasintophats> it is all in-engine
[4:03:14] <%johnny_gogo> ITS NOT BAD
[4:03:15] <hkgamingtv> but it's on 360 tho
[4:03:16] <donstylo> Only Halo 1 and 2 are Remastered.
[4:03:17] <DigitalJoshie> it's not as bad as halo1 tho
[4:03:17] <+Fenrein> Halo 3 needs a remaster
[4:03:20] <RahuHordika> YUP You gonna get a downgrade
[4:03:20] <%Pyroclase> Halo 3 doesn't have an anniversary version is probably why
[4:03:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> 3 looks fine enough tho
[4:03:22] <%BoondockJoker> wait til you see lord hood in halo 3 Kappa
[4:03:23] <%subjectg> 3 is not getting a remaster because it still looks pretty good
[4:03:23] <dabeaminator> Halo 3 is the only one that didn't get an anniversary
[4:03:24] <+D00msDayDan> studio blur costs money, man
[4:03:24] <FreedomARX7> Halo 3 was fine
[4:03:25] <mujahideenfruityrebels> 3 looks alright
[4:03:26] <Catpurrple> @WoolieVersus Because they had to port Halo 3 from scratch
[4:03:27] <%Daniel_Is_I> Because 2 is the BABY
[4:03:27] <zashrin777> halo 3 reeeally needs a remaster.
[4:03:29] <%Firststrike_OW> 3 holds up
[4:03:29] <Goraka91> 3 is next gen
[4:03:29] <Joestar1890> CAUSE 2 IS THE BEST
[4:03:29] <Halospaz117> Halo Wars also looks pretty good tho
[4:03:30] <prince_johnny_> nah dont remaster
[4:03:30] <%alpacasintophats> halo 2 is the series favorite
[4:03:30] <Mr_Taters > 3 still looks quite good overall
[4:03:33] <%subjectg> Aside from lord hood of course
[4:03:33] <%PadreHail> 3 is nice
[4:03:35] <%alpacasintophats> overall
[4:03:35] <hkgamingtv> 3 holds up
[4:03:37] <chainsaw105> 343 refuses to remaster 3
[4:03:37] <FiendishlyInventive> Remaster 3. Do it though, cowards.
[4:03:39] <%exnuart> 2 is the golden child
[4:03:39] <wibbwobbler> fan service?
[4:03:42] <Halospaz117> Cuz 3 didn't need it
[4:03:43] <+Fenrein> Halo 2 was a 10 year anniversary project. It's been 12 years since Halo 3
[4:03:43] <geassguy360> YEP They should do it for all 3
[4:03:43] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Halo 2 is as more popular for one
[4:03:44] <prince_johnny_> 3 is good
[4:03:44] <dailylifewithry> Because 343
[4:03:45] <%Lizard0TM> H2A get this treatment because it came out in 2015 not 2007
[4:03:52] <+phatmac16> 343 doesn't want to do it
[4:03:52] <%Slimshazbot> Because 3 doesn't need it and H1A was a hacked together slapjob
[4:03:54] <drewslo> halo 2a came out after halo 4
[4:03:56] <%raven_frame> Halo 2 Anniversary was kind of a treat to encourage people to get Halo 5.
[4:04:00] <therealtacopancakes> that was halo 4 and 5 level cutscene
[4:04:00] <dabeaminator> Halo Wars 2 got these cutscenes
[4:04:02] <DigitalJoshie> 13 didn't get remastered like 1 and 2, but 3 ain't bad
[4:04:09] <DigitalJoshie> 3*
[4:04:15] <Axle13j> that combo breaker hoodie is sweet
[4:04:15] <%Slimshazbot> 3 was 07
[4:04:17] <+TheWingedBeatle> 2007
[4:04:18] <%Lizard0TM> 3 came out in 2007
[4:04:19] <DinoBear_7> 3 would have been 2017
[4:04:21] <%subjectg> If anything Halo 3 deserves more praise for having good looking cutscenes for being in-engine
[4:04:22] <%RunningNGunning> Halo 2 is the beginning of what I consider Prime Halo to be
[4:04:22] <+in_spaaace> 3 was never remade
[4:04:23] <+lupus_man> Halo wars 1 and 2 have blur quality cutscenes
[4:04:23] <+phatmac16> 2017
[4:04:24] <%johnny_gogo> 3 isnt remastered
[4:04:24] <+whiskeybuisness> halo 3 was 2007
[4:04:27] <thetransagenda> 2007
[4:04:29] <+Ropcord> PogChamp
[4:04:29] <Goraka91> Yeyeyeye
[4:04:30] <+NocturnePsycho> they never remastered 3
[4:04:32] <%Gruhunchously> Halo 3 on PC
[4:04:33] <FiendishlyInventive> 2017. It should have been.
[4:04:34] <greengregguy> no remake for 3
[4:04:39] <Gamertilltime> halo 3 never got remastered
[4:04:39] <mujahideenfruityrebels> ‘07 was 3
[4:04:42] <%TheMilhouseExperience> 3 wasn’t remastered
[4:04:43] <RetributionP> speaking of which WOLLIE Halo wars when? Lol
[4:04:46] <%RunningNGunning> yes
[4:04:47] <mesamus> they upscaled 3 as far as i know
[4:04:52] <+AriaMeloetta> MCC came out during H2 10 year Anniversary, which is why it got special treatment
[4:04:52] <+lupus_man> Halo 3 never got and anniversary addition
[4:04:54] <%kingdovachief> I WANT MY HALO 3 REMASTERED
[4:04:59] <wibbwobbler> can't hire blur to go back, and halo 3 is good enough
[4:05:01] <Halospaz117> Halo 2A came with MCC I think
[4:05:02] <hkgamingtv> 3 is still good tho
[4:05:05] <+D00msDayDan> CE anniversary is a standalone release, 2 anniversary is part of mcc, 3 is just HD now
[4:05:05] <+phatmac16> Halo 1 was remastered by a different studio, 2 was remade by 343
[4:05:06] <%LozsCat> 2 went with mcc
[4:05:07] <%NovaKnightmare> 3 holds up
[4:05:09] <%Slimshazbot> 3's campaign is a slight step down IMO
[4:05:09] <+Fenrein> 3 is upscaled but never received any remaster treatment yeah
[4:05:12] <%alpacasintophats> 3 is special yeah
[4:05:13] <OverlordLuna> Reach tho Kreygasm
[4:05:15] <+emeraldstreak> exactly
[4:05:18] <xxshadowxx416> no halo 2 a was the collection
[4:05:22] <%TheMilhouseExperience> 3 is fine and doesn’t need a remaster.
[4:05:23] <%Gruhunchously> Reach?
[4:05:23] <hkgamingtv> do Reach last
[4:05:23] <dabeaminator> YOU'LL GET THERE
[4:05:30] <critfumble_> 3 reach odst the best
[4:05:31] <FirewallStorm> Reach and Halo 4 is probably my favorite
[4:05:34] <danielmorn> 3s gameplay is great but story doesnt compare to 2
[4:05:38] <drewslo> 1 2 3 odst 1a wars reach 4 2a wars2 5
[4:05:38] <Halospaz117> Like I think 2A was a big selling point for the MCC
[4:05:39] <donstylo> Halo 3 wasn't on Pc back than so i think they put a higher resolution and some options. So I would say it's a classic or soft Remaster.
[4:05:43] <black0193> I think the sound effects in 3 are a little too quite but overall it still holds up visually.
[4:05:46] <guenbooty> Halo 3 GOAT
[4:05:51] <hkgamingtv> 1 is the only game that REALLY needed it
[4:05:55] <%nerdaficionado> @WoolieVersus maybe it's too soon to ask, but are you guys planning on doing ODST?
[4:05:56] <%johnny_gogo> 3 is a 9/10 at best and 7.5 at worst
[4:05:57] <dailylifewithry> 3 story isn’t as daring as 2, but it’s probably the most fun game to play of the trilogy, and it still hits its great moments
[4:05:59] <wibbwobbler> everybody has their favorite before 4
[4:06:00] <%exnuart> halo 2 remaster was the selling point of MCC
[4:06:04] <lotharrio> The first hour and the last hour are always the biggest moments, right?
[4:06:08] <%Cozy90> any game where i can play as an elite is my game
[4:06:09] <OverlordLuna> Are they doing Halo Wars? Kappa
[4:06:10] <+whiskeybuisness> LASO playthrough when?
[4:06:19] <dabeaminator> I have to believe 3 Anniversary is in dev for my own sanity
[4:06:19] <DinoBear_7> Yes
[4:06:19] <%johnny_gogo> YES
[4:06:20] <alrobot2014> yes
[4:06:22] <%raven_frame> Yes.
[4:06:22] <+Fenrein> Halo 4 had come out
[4:06:22] <Baway> Project cartographer > MCC :)
[4:06:22] <DigitalJoshie> yeah
[4:06:23] <mesamus> yes
[4:06:23] <%Gruhunchously> Those cutscenes looks damn expensive though
[4:06:26] <dabeaminator> yeah
[4:06:26] <%alpacasintophats> 4 was out and 5 hype was building
[4:06:26] <Joestar1890> 4 was out
[4:06:27] <OverlordLuna> yep
[4:06:28] <drewslo> after 4
[4:06:30] <Mr_Taters > It didn't help that the MCC launch was really bad
[4:06:31] <+whiskeybuisness> 4 was on xbone mcc
[4:06:32] <thetransagenda> halo 2 anniversary was mcc exclusive
[4:06:35] <donstylo> I hope Halo 5 get's a PC port
[4:06:35] <%prime_name> 5 tho...
[4:06:36] <%Deadpal> 5 has prerendered cutscenes and so does 4
[4:06:36] <+Fenrein> I dislike 4
[4:06:37] <DinoBear_7> Halo 2 anniversary is exclusive to the MCC
[4:06:37] <Dapper_Cactuar> 4 is mainly forgettable
[4:06:38] <wibbwobbler> boo
[4:06:38] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @overlordluna What about Spartan Strike? LUL
[4:06:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Half of 4 is good the other half is GARBAGE.
[4:06:40] <BurdRightsActivist> MCC With Updates > Project Cartographer :)
[4:06:41] <Joestar1890> Story is good, gameplay not as good
[4:06:42] <%exnuart> Halo 2 anniversary was the MCC
[4:06:43] <drewslo> 4 is fine
[4:06:44] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Halo sales realy went down with each game
[4:06:46] <Mr_Taters > It's really great now though (the MCC)
[4:06:47] <%Cozy90> Woolie no Elite gameplay in 4 and 5
[4:06:48] <Goraka91> 4 is better than 5 but that's not saying much
[4:06:49] <prince_johnny_> and 5 is astrocius
[4:06:50] <+Msytic6> Halo 5 hype letdown :(
[4:06:50] <rosabellamelantha> REACH AND ODST ARE GREAT
[4:06:51] <wibbwobbler> 4 sux
[4:06:51] <%alpacasintophats> 5 is bad because the dumb shit is not cool
[4:06:52] <Halospaz117> Wars?
[4:06:52] <zashrin777> visually, no, but story and gameplay, yes
[4:06:52] <dabeaminator> When Bungie leaves, you leave
[4:06:52] <eliudfs1> ODST is great too
[4:06:52] <+Ropcord> 4 and 5 are good
[4:06:53] <+lupus_man> @woolieversus anniversary 2 was essentially a big marketing push for 5
[4:06:53] <mdkcde> halo 4 id boring azz shut
[4:06:55] <%Tearonex> Reach is great
[4:06:55] <%Gruhunchously> 5 is bad
[4:06:56] <critfumble_> REACH GANG
[4:06:57] <%Deadpal> Deadpal subscribed at Tier 1.
[4:06:58] <FirewallStorm> Halo 4 has the best story
[4:06:59] <hkgamingtv> don't get it twisted they're all good, just the Bungie ones are better
[4:06:59] <%alpacasintophats> and is thus extra dumb
[4:07:02] <+NocturnePsycho> 4 is a step down but not an insult like 5
[4:07:03] <+Zyquux> When's the Forge series?
[4:07:03] <+Jessie_Lockhart> By 5 the franchise just wasnt what it once was
[4:07:03] <Djinnazz> Yeah
[4:07:04] <Halospaz117> Wars might come close visually
[4:07:04] <Sauceboss15> REACH GANG
[4:07:04] <%astrofalcon1> 4 is perfect Kappa
[4:07:04] <mdkcde> halo 4 is TERRIBLE
[4:07:05] <Xiangchang> All the mainline Halo games had a three year cycle, except for Infinite which is coming out five years after Halo 5.
[4:07:07] <+greatgetter> Halo Wars and Wards 2 has these cutscenes
[4:07:11] <%johnny_gogo> it holds up really well in my experience
[4:07:11] <DigitalJoshie> we gonna learn eventually
[4:07:13] <BurdRightsActivist> 4 had sprint by default ResidentSleeper
[4:07:14] <OverlordLuna> Remember Reach
[4:07:16] <mesamus> WOOLIE STOP READING
[4:07:16] <dabeaminator> NO STOP
[4:07:16] <%MacabreOpus> 4 is great just not as fulfilling as the first five installments (inc ODST)
[4:07:17] <PleasantLeech> reach tho
[4:07:18] <wibbwobbler> REACH IMO
[4:07:18] <black0193> 5 easily has the worst campaign in the series.
[4:07:21] <torres_kun> 4 is just boring
[4:07:21] <mesamus> WOOLIE LET V READ
[4:07:21] <dabeaminator> Have V read
[4:07:22] <zocano> 4 is a good story, boring mission design; 5 is bad story, good mission design
[4:07:25] <dabeaminator> STOP
[4:07:30] <%Gruhunchously> HOES MAD
[4:07:33] <whatatkins> @WoolieVersus LET V READ
[4:07:34] <%Deadpal> 5 Has pre rendered cutscenes and so does halo 4
[4:07:35] <TheChucklingOak> Oh god no, please don't read chat anymore.
[4:07:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> WARNING, LET V READ
[4:07:37] <mesamus> STOP let V read and filter it out
[4:07:38] <%subjectg> Hoes very mad
[4:07:39] <mdkcde> @black0193 you mistyped 5
[4:07:41] <dabeaminator> Just let V read so he doesn't have to yell
[4:07:41] <Shinyaron> @WoolieVersus IIRC remade cut-scenes were done by a different studio?
[4:07:44] <torres_kun> Good story tho
[4:07:54] <+RyTYoung> noo I've missed the strem
[4:07:55] <correctedsun117> he are
[4:07:58] <FirewallStorm> Halo 2 and Halo 4 probably has the best stories in the trilogy
[4:08:01] <%TheMilhouseExperience> 4 has actively bad mission design on half its missions.
[4:08:01] <BurdRightsActivist> GUYS Woolie CAN READ. He's not illiterate, how dare you guys say that about hi,?

[4:10:32] <%Deadpal> in halo 2 if you're in the passanger seat you can hit the driver
[4:10:32] <zashrin777> hop in the passenger seat and club the driver to death
[4:10:43] <TheChucklingOak> I think the passenger can shoot/punch the driver, if i recall
[4:10:43] <%subjectg> If you’re in the passenger’s seat you can beat up the driver

[4:13:35] <+jv5_guy> metal jesus
[4:13:45] <%jiggy_snipe> just beccause someone shares some aspects of their life doesn't mean they want to share everything

[4:14:01] <+xerotwo> Movin on up~
[4:14:16] <dabeaminator> I hate the internet so much
[4:14:20] <Shinyaron> Hey Woolie, did you know you can use the sniper rifles scope to extend the range of your sword lunge? You can do some big shenanigans.
[4:14:22] <+miyoles> no Halo spoilers chat
[4:14:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> Halo legends? I wonder how Woolie will react to that
[4:14:36] <%chll0ne> are they gonna play reach?
[4:14:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Especially considering they cut that level
[4:14:52] <hkgamingtv> I've played em all and Halo 2 remains my favorite
[4:14:52] <+Fenrein> Well we have to get to 3 first
[4:14:59] <OldManDeckardCain> people are stupid enough to send death threats to voice actors, what do you guys expect LUL
[4:15:02] <dabeaminator> Christ, he won't react to it. Why can't people understand that he's only playing the games.
[4:15:04] <Targical> Until it isn’t lol

[4:15:12] <+xerotwo> LUL
[4:15:28] <The_Swedish_X> Arby has some dark ass levels.
[4:15:39] <+miyoles> Halo 5 is fun guys
[4:15:49] <%subjectg> the best part is the skull’s called “Envy”
[4:15:50] <+Ancopro> thats amazing
[4:15:53] <mesamus> 5 has a fun multiplayer
[4:15:53] <%Pyroclase> I love cheat codes.
[4:15:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:15:58] <hkgamingtv> agreed 5 is good, just not as good
[4:16:02] <%chll0ne> @oldmandeckardcain internet is weird as hell lmao
[4:16:05] <Sauceboss15> 5 is fun, but its Halo in name only
[4:16:08] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @wibbwobbler 343 also forgot about humor and any charm at all
[4:16:09] <Halospaz117> BANG BANG
[4:16:09] <UvBenServed> Hand cannon is great
[4:16:11] <Halospaz117> PEW
[4:16:11] <FirewallStorm> Halo 5 movie fun but ruined the story up to that point

[4:16:42] <%dekkitout> "No, we didn't. How could we have known."
[4:16:45] <%Lizard0TM> Keyes says it in Halo CE
[4:16:47] <+DappercatEsquire> Negative association achieved

[4:16:58] <Catpurrple> You all can like your books, but honestly, fuck the books. Games come first.
[4:16:59] <BurdRightsActivist> IT DOES THOUGH
[4:16:59] <+miyoles> chat ruins Halo
[4:17:00] <+craftyraichu> Doesn't Captain Keyes enact it in the opening scene of Halo 1?
[4:17:00] <mesamus> KEYES straight up says it V in the FIRST GAME
[4:17:01] <+emeraldstreak> Keyes talks about it in the opening of CE
[4:17:04] <FiendishlyInventive> It's in the first game
[4:17:05] <dabeaminator> Yeah, stream viewers are fucking chud idiots, we know, ignore them and move on
[4:17:07] <huskarl_zap> THE CODEX ASTARTES
[4:17:08] <%TangeloGuy> ITS A BOOK
[4:17:09] <%Deadpal> I don't actually know

[4:17:09] <+phatmac16> when will chat learn?
[4:17:11] <%prime_name> I don't know!
[4:17:11] <+maenos2> keyes mentions it offhand in 1
[4:17:12] <%Deadpal> people trolling you.
[4:17:13] <+miyoles> chat made me hate Halo now
[4:17:13] <wibbwobbler> read it
[4:17:14] <+Reverend_Roscoe> It just says to contain info about earth
[4:17:15] <%Deadpal> it's not a great book.
[4:17:17] <%subjectg> Unfortunately gushing about something cuz you can’t keep it in your pants forms spite, and some people don’t recognize that
[4:17:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Keyes encats the COLE PROTOCOL in the opening scene of Halo 1 PogChamp
[4:17:20] <%Deadpal> it's meh.
[4:17:21] <vulkan_vibes> yeah. right before the alarms go off on PoA
[4:17:21] <leroyslammin> Ya'll about to ruin Halo for Woolie
[4:17:23] <correctedsun117> Well good, cause you'll never hear it
[4:17:24] <The_Swedish_X> People need to calm down. Myself included.
[4:17:25] <wibbwobbler> its bad
[4:17:31] <vulkan_vibes> SICK ASS
[4:17:32] <Catpurrple> Halo wars cutscenes are fantastic, both games
[4:17:33] <critfumble_> HALOWARS CUTSCRNES SLAP
[4:17:36] <$Futurecity10> halo wars 2 sucks ass
[4:17:36] <+DappercatEsquire> Woolie gets into RTSes
[4:17:37] <Goraka91> Sure does
[4:17:39] <Joestar1890> Halo Wars has some good shit
[4:17:41] <%jinking79> shotoBoi
[4:17:44] <%Pyroclase> I hope Woolie gets to see "that one cutscene" from Halo 4
[4:17:45] <%raven_frame> Keyes initialized Cole Protocol at the start of CE.
[4:17:48] <TheChucklingOak> Oh no now chat is gonna spoil Halo Wars.
[4:17:48] <%Firststrike_OW> The arbiter in halo wars is so sick
[4:17:49] <critfumble_> ALSO TRUE
[4:17:50] <$Futurecity10> Halo wars 1 is kino
[4:17:50] <prince_johnny_> yeaa
[4:17:51] <Halospaz117> Dude, Monsters from Halo Wars 1 is one of my favorite cutscenes in the series
[4:17:52] <Catpurrple> It's a really great simple RTS
[4:17:53] <+chubbypencil> is this end of stream or start?
[4:17:53] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Halo wars is GOOD THO
[4:17:55] <critfumble_> I SEE YOU V
[4:17:55] <%prime_name> Real fun RTS spinoff
[4:17:56] <dabeaminator> On PC, yeah
[4:17:56] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Halo Wars has some cool action cutscenes
[4:18:00] <+Fenrein> Would Woolie play through an RTS?
[4:18:01] <Halospaz117> I gotta get around to Wars 2
[4:18:01] <vulkan_vibes> it's a mesh RTS, airy V
[4:18:01] <wibbwobbler> i like halo wars
[4:18:02] <TheChucklingOak> Fucking damn it what did I just say?
[4:18:05] <prince_johnny_> halo wars so good
[4:18:05] <+HotBloodedHero> Infinite is gonna have some Halo Wars shit
[4:18:06] <+ThePimpGuin> eeeh
[4:18:10] <critfumble_> I also like halo wars
[4:18:11] <dailylifewithry> And Halo Wars has a tie-in to the upcoming Halo Infinite
[4:18:11] <%subjectg> It’s kinda simple but it’s fun
[4:18:13] <+xeros720> microsoft ran it into the ground
[4:18:22] <Daxalog> Remember Halo is rife with mismanagement
[4:18:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> .....why
[4:18:26] <+D00msDayDan> big budget doesn't mean that budget is used well
[4:18:27] <unclekulikov> Load the OG shit on youtube
[4:18:28] <Halospaz117> I think part of it was that CEA was 343's first thing they did
[4:18:28] <+Zyquux> Ariel bombardment with Pelicans is so much fun in Halo Wars
[4:18:34] <Goraka91> Nah but we gotta push [REDACTED] for Summer Slam!
[4:18:39] <+phatmac16> halo's popularit has gone down
[4:18:56] <%Slimshazbot> I was SO FUCKING WORRIED that this game would keep cutting back to Halo 5 man asking questions then going back to Halo 2
[4:18:56] <Catpurrple> Yeah, halo infinite has ties to Halo Wars 2 and it's super cool. It was kind of weird for them to just not have any overlap before.
[4:18:57] <+TawnyMonarch> always release order
[4:19:06] <@Menitta> it shouldn't have really been in a collection
[4:19:08] <%subjectg> @deadpal i’ll always remember that book for having a dude named bonifacio
[4:19:15] <Goraka91> Much like Hollywood it's all remakes
[4:19:15] <+TawnyMonarch> fucked out of quality as you may be
[4:19:21] <@Menitta> Modern Warfare 2 has a pretty decent remaster
[4:19:21] <%Pyroclase> The Modern Warfare Remaster crashes constantly on my PC and I couldn't finish it.
[4:19:26] <%Chatterbox1991> Modern Warfare Remastered Trilogy retcons a bunch of shit and its the worst
[4:19:28] <hkgamingtv> do Reach last, it's a great pallet cleanser, prequel anyway
[4:19:28] <ValentineHearts> see I kinda disagree, I saw that cutscene and never played halo 4 or three and it really didnt spoil shit for me, its real vague though i might be mis-remembering
[4:19:29] <The_Swedish_X> 'Hey, y'all feeling nostalgic!!?"
[4:19:29] <+Ancopro> Goldeneye is NEXT BB
[4:19:30] <sou1less_> wouldve bought MW2 remake if it had online
[4:19:32] <wibbwobbler> crysis
[4:19:32] <%dekkitout> Crysis Remaster sipsipGasm
[4:19:42] <+phatmac16> crysis remaster lol
[4:19:44] <+xerotwo> CRYSIS ON THE SWITCH LUL
[4:19:45] <ValentineHearts> halo 4 or 5* I played 3 whoops lol
[4:19:51] <FiendishlyInventive> "Cole Protocol is clear, the capture or destruction of a shipboard A.I is absolutely unacceptable." -Captain Keyes (Opening of Halo CE)
[4:19:55] <BurdRightsActivist> Zoomer remakes 4Head
[4:19:55] <%Solidnick18> crysis Kreygasm
[4:20:02] <Mr_Taters > That cutscene in front of 2 here was a bad idea
[4:20:05] <+krispen_wa> all the Crysis Remaster will do is make it multithreaded
[4:20:09] <+TawnyMonarch> oh shit get owned V
[4:20:23] <%TheMilhouseExperience> After 4s stumble and 5, Halo isn’t as popular among older fans. Wars is good but it’s different.
[4:20:31] <hkgamingtv> aw jeez guys, way to spoiler Kotor for me! lol
[4:20:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> Someone Spoil for me what the spoiler cutscene says, im PM
[4:20:41] <TheChucklingOak> Woolie it's not your fault, Chat is just dicks
[4:20:44] <%subjectg> Well you can kinda stumble into that cutscene about Traya early if you have high INT
[4:20:50] <%Cozy90> has anything for halo infinite been announced?
[4:20:52] <RunoEddie> man, remember Nier's OP?
[4:20:52] <dailylifewithry> It all comes down to, how much do you care about spoilers. For someone like, I don’t really, but some people it will ruin the entire experience
[4:20:58] <Targical> Right, like ff7
[4:21:00] <+ThePimpGuin> nah fuck that. halo 5 aint in the MCC so it shouldn't be in 2
[4:21:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> IT WAS RAD
[4:21:09] <heartlesshealer> ah, that's how they patched it
[4:21:19] <+Fenrein> Halo 2 speedruns are wacky
[4:21:19] <Xiangchang> Super Bounces were crazy, too.
[4:21:23] <Halospaz117> You could fucking fly with the sword
[4:21:24] <%Deadpal> primary attack, reload and jump
[4:21:26] <%Deadpal> all at once
[4:21:29] <%Pyroclase> Bioshock 2 is criminally underrated
[4:21:31] <laguerrilha> Wars Would be good if they would make it just for PC and improved base making to a Starcraft format
[4:21:32] <Goraka91> Oh man the drill is just like the sword huh
[4:21:32] <$Futurecity10> Butterfly jumping was amazing in Halo 2
[4:21:37] <Ynkubus_> BUtterlfying is amazing
[4:21:37] <+xeros720> hell yeah, bioshock 2 did that real good
[4:21:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> Bioshock 2 doesnt need to exist story-wise but gameplay was solid
[4:21:40] <FiendishlyInventive> No, you're right WOOLIE, someone needs to mod it out of the MCC.
[4:21:40] <Mr_Taters > The drill in that game is so fun
[4:21:42] <+Ancopro> bioshock 2 as videogame i think is pretty fun
[4:21:42] <+phatmac16> bioshock 2 is pretty good
[4:21:45] <%Tuna_Can_0> every stat goes to DRILL
[4:21:46] <+lupus_man> @thepimpguin halo 2 anniversary was literally a marketing push for 5 it’s why the cutscenes in there
[4:21:51] <+bendatron> boishock 2 is alright its just a slog for me
[4:21:51] <wibbwobbler> not enough bioshock love
[4:21:52] <Catpurrple> I don't mind locke talking about shit in the terminals, but him being thrust into the intro cutscene isn't that great.
[4:21:55] <alrobot2014> oh it is still in there in this version i'm pretty sure
[4:21:55] <+Ancopro> as narrative m,eeeh
[4:21:57] <%dekkitout> "See that guy over there? He doesn't know who the hell you are..."
[4:21:58] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Bioshock 2 was fantastic
[4:21:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> You basically delayed and stacked multiple lunges that all go off at once.
[4:21:58] <jamesthebrave> I played through Bioshock 2 pretty recently and I had a great time with it
[4:21:59] <DigitalJoshie> dats a good start
[4:21:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> Bioshock 2 was FUN it just shouldnt have existed
[4:21:59] <%subjectg> The idea is that if you scope in with a sniper rifle, the reticle turns red, right? What if you switch to a sword the split second during that reticle being red? @woolieversus
[4:22:01] <+phatmac16> yeyeyeyeye
[4:22:03] <wibbwobbler> bioshock2 love
