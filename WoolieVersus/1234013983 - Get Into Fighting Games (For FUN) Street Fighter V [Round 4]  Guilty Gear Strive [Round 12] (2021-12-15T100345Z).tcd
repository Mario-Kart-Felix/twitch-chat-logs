[0:01:12] <%leith_aziz> @CaptainPileDriver I mean, I can enjoy Ky fro mtiem to tiem, allthough that's mayeb more because I like Ky's character than playstyle

[0:01:15] <dds333a> hi, hey, hello again

[0:01:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> luke is the most boring shoto i've seen.
[0:01:24] <DrkJP520> hee-hello-ho
[0:01:26] <%leith_aziz> Hi guys pickyWave
[0:01:35] <%leith_aziz> *from time
[0:01:44] <%leith_aziz> Wow, my spelling
[0:02:09] <darkodargon> hi all
[0:02:17] <%leith_aziz> Im basically the same
[0:02:18] <+Jiggisnipe> Arc Sys is on a legendary run
[0:02:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> arcsys has more interesting things going on right now than anyone else
[0:02:33] <dds333a> it sure was
[0:02:38] <%leith_aziz> Allthough im mainly busy with one game, and it's Strive
[0:02:46] <%leith_aziz> pickyProud
[0:03:06] <dds333a> Time was split between kof and marvel a lot years ago
[0:03:07] <%jinking79> ppl where wait for the Luke story stuff boy were they disappointed LUL
[0:03:09] <dds333a> for
[0:03:11] <darkodargon> strive is drugs
[0:03:13] <+DatAsuna> alpha 3 was a weird SF to start with for me
[0:03:39] <%Shad0wTag> @DatAsuna basically anime game progenitor
[0:04:17] <Invess> I used to have hair like Reggie's. Boss made me get rid of it
[0:04:23] <+Jiggisnipe> probably
[0:04:27] <dds333a> the tail end LUL
[0:04:56] <%leith_aziz> Funnily enough, I commented in Max's video that I was joyfull that Strive won fighting game, and a random guy called me an Arcsys fanboy because he thinks those games are trash. pickyShrug
[0:04:58] <dds333a> And then SF VI years from now
[0:05:27] <stormhawk9891> @leith_aziz Then that guy's an idiot
[0:05:29] <%jinking79> if SFV gave everyone a second super i stay a bit longer
[0:05:36] <+DatAsuna> @DatAsuna hmm, yeah i feel it
[0:05:39] <+Jiggisnipe> naw that's not until late 2022
[0:05:43] <niffinbox> heyo woolie and reggie you guys gonna play sifu when it comes out??
[0:06:11] <%leith_aziz> Oddly enough, I was actually glad that there wasnt news of a new NRS game. Mainly because it gives spotlight for other devs to shine like Arcsys and SNK
[0:06:11] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1468148034802532354?t=ufv885ONB9gNiHU8rEm7rw&s=19
[0:06:40] <%Dr00_PhD> probably gonna be at capcom cup in feb
[0:06:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> if luke is the future i'm not gonna touch that game with a 10ft poll
[0:07:24] <%jinking79> sf6 announced in 2024 release in 2026 I'm just throwing shit out there
[0:07:26] <%leith_aziz> Logo/CG trailer - gameplay trailer 6 months later
[0:07:55] <dds333a> they take their time
[0:08:08] <OldManDeckardCain> excited for ono-less sf future
[0:08:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> ono killed the fighting game section so they're trying to revive it
[0:08:33] <%leith_aziz> Managment has shaked up with Ono leaving.
[0:09:18] <Th3rd3> at the end of sf6 reveal trailer they gonna show Luke and Ryu doing air dash
[0:09:38] <SaintSalted> dnf duel
[0:09:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they have other games out, but no fighters so it feels a bit empty
[0:09:42] <%leith_aziz> DNF Duel, BB Rollback, Happy Chaos in Baiken in Strive
[0:09:53] <%leith_aziz> *and
[0:09:59] <%gulthrax> KOF in feb
[0:10:06] <%townzzzzz> can't risk that monster hunter money on silly projects

[0:10:54] <dds333a> you got the game LUL
[0:10:55] <%notsoy> that tekken complete edition thing feels like a wrap on that, and we'll see tekken 8 in 2-3 years
[0:10:56] <%jinking79> snk finally got a character out of the copyright loop
[0:11:06] <+deadredeyez> yea

[0:13:49] <dds333a> Mark of the Beast is coming Kappa
[0:13:50] <fuji_n2> the wrestlemania sign: end of the world is getting closer (it wasn't)
[0:14:07] <+DatAsuna> "Second coming is in my generation, for sure for sure"
[0:14:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> SHOREH PIPPI
[0:14:36] <%Shad0wTag> Guilty Gear Crusades incoming
[0:14:39] <dds333a> LUL
[0:14:44] <%Plus_On_Black> What's good?
[0:14:47] <dds333a> "quality"
[0:15:01] <TheQuadrupleS> That was a good watch
[0:15:01] <%leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Prequel? I'd be for it
[0:15:19] <BlackermanZX> the best part of the game awards was E c l i p s e
[0:15:23] <%jinking79> Ming rage at Shang LUL
[0:15:32] <%jinking79> Minh*
[0:15:35] <fuji_n2> yeah the eclipse clip was wild LUL
[0:15:37] <%Shad0wTag> @Shad0wTag I mostly making a joke about real life, but that wouldn't be too bad either I suppose
[0:15:39] <dds333a> "gameplay" Kappa
[0:15:45] <+Jiggisnipe> gameplay tho huh
[0:15:45] <+DatAsuna> Maybe he hates perspective puzzles
[0:15:55] <%Shad0wTag> wack
[0:16:04] <OldManDeckardCain> senua is too gimmicky for me tbh
[0:16:06] <+MisterAvry> I liked shang chi
[0:16:14] <dds333a> He wanted urban fantasy LUL
[0:16:18] <flamingkrieg> Woolie, what should I make: a One Piece beat em up or a Danganronpa Fighting game? Both with pixelart
[0:16:18] <+MisterAvry> he punched the guys good and the rings was fun
[0:16:22] <%leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Im not suprised. I suck at jokes and sarcasm pickyTired
[0:16:23] <legacy0117> Yea some Street Fighter times now.
[0:16:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[0:16:49] <dds333a> @fuji_n2 it's almost like he forgot talking about it LUL
[0:16:55] <dds333a> weeks ago
[0:17:06] <%leith_aziz> Wind'ss howling
[0:17:14] <+MisterAvry> yeah the cold sucks
[0:17:20] <nintega010> @woolieversus the knuckles your reaction was worth the game awards stream
[0:17:52] <nintega010> your knuckles
[0:18:23] <dds333a> that was the one
[0:18:25] <+DatAsuna> Yeah even though infamous is a shooter lol
[0:18:26] <fuji_n2> they're still he smart thing in my kind
[0:18:29] <fuji_n2> *mind
[0:18:33] <%leith_aziz> Infamous. Loved that series pickyLove
[0:18:40] <fuji_n2> the same thing*
[0:18:42] <DrkJP520> They are completely different though
[0:18:44] <fuji_n2> dammit phone
[0:18:47] <+DatAsuna> Sony did that to themself a bit with resistance and killzone
[0:18:51] <dds333a> White House Down and Olympus has Fallen was a big one too
[0:18:53] <%leith_aziz> Tonaly, they are very different
[0:19:00] <+MisterAvry> one was more goopy than the other I think
[0:19:11] <%Shad0wTag> I will never forgive Acti-Blizz for closing the studio who made Prototype, I legit liked that franchise
[0:19:12] <%jinking79> Parcore Lighting boy and T Virus Hulk
[0:19:13] <+Mordexai_> I can't believe K9999 is back
[0:19:14] <OldManDeckardCain> HAHAHAHAHAHAH
[0:19:17] <OldManDeckardCain> fuck no
[0:19:31] <%leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag The 1st Protoype was very fun. I don't blame you
[0:19:36] <fuji_n2> yeah K9999 being back feels like a fever dream, I'm happy tho
[0:19:38] <%townzzzzz> DEFEND YOURSELF
[0:19:42] <dds333a> Nor to mention that infamous is far better. Prototype sucks hard LUL
[0:20:10] <%leith_aziz> @dds333a Nah. I love Infamous but saying one is good and one is trash is asking for trouble
[0:20:24] <%leith_aziz> Both games have merit
[0:20:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:20:27] <dds333a> @leith_aziz not when it's true LUL
[0:20:57] <%leith_aziz> @dds333a Not convinced, sorry pickyShrug
[0:21:02] <floralkami> @dds333a frfr, them's fighting words
[0:21:04] <+KUYAmoPESh> I just got in, what's the topic on the docket?
[0:21:08] <%jinking79> 150 dragon ball video removed
[0:21:29] <fuji_n2> nah dds333a is right, just look at the franchise that survived
[0:21:33] <+KUYAmoPESh> oooff!
[0:21:35] <dds333a> @leith_aziz don't worry, I'm not trying to. Prototype is only slightly fun LUL
[0:21:43] <+KUYAmoPESh> @jinking79 thanks bruv
[0:21:46] <floralkami> i love both of those games, and both first games had their faults, while both second games were also better
[0:21:52] <OldManDeckardCain> speaking of dragon ball, that new dbd style game sucks balls LUL played the beta for a bit and boy was that shiet rough
[0:22:20] <%leith_aziz> @floralkami Infamous 2 is the best one, but I think Prototype fans would tell you they enjoy the 1st game more
[0:22:23] <floralkami> @fuji_n2 that wasn't a survival, that was a last breath
[0:22:31] <+Huttersson> Kinda sound like woolie got a bit of a cold there
[0:22:47] <dds333a> hence no outros LUL
[0:22:54] <+DatAsuna> Maybe in future just cutting it into smaller reacts could help and leave the full vod for twitch
[0:22:57] <dds333a> only Korean slayer LUL LUL
[0:23:01] <fuji_n2> @floralkami I can see a new infamous coming someday, I can't see a new prototype...
[0:23:06] <+samuraiknack> Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction shits over Infamous and Prototype. (Even if Prototype is technically a spiritual sequel
[0:23:09] <%jinking79> 10 year wait to copyright someone
[0:23:10] <%gulthrax> Elden Ring fextraHype
[0:23:14] <fuji_n2> that's survival imo
[0:23:19] <legacy0117> It’s cold in Canada now. Don’t worry bout it.
[0:23:20] <Guigondi> Totally Not Mark's case really saddens me
[0:23:33] <+weebalert> square enix be copyright striking for their music
[0:23:33] <floralkami> @leith_aziz *shrug* i like both equally.
[0:23:49] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie put me on Animals as Leaders through podcast ending music
[0:24:02] <%Shad0wTag> @Guigondi its dumb because Toei has hired him for work in the past
[0:24:05] <%leith_aziz> @floralkami Don't take my opinion like facts to influence yours. That's exactly what I fight for
[0:24:24] <nintega010> nice anime. Good mech design
[0:24:26] <+TotesBurger> It's an action mecha game inspired by Getter Robo, Mazinger and such
[0:24:27] <TigerClaws12> mecha game on switch
[0:24:39] <%Shad0wTag> og super robot woolz
[0:24:41] <Deko_> i see big robots
[0:24:42] <+Dorf1> Musashi Gundoh is more my speed
[0:24:43] <floralkami> @fuji_n2 i can only see a new infamous coming back cause a new prototype would kinda ruin the story or threaten to beat a dead horse.
[0:24:48] <+Mordexai_> just found it
[0:25:01] <+TotesBurger> You can also build your bots.
[0:25:33] <%leith_aziz> @floralkami I think SuckerPunch is done with Infamous. I feel like they did all they wanted by Second Son and First Light
[0:25:37] <fuji_n2> Luke Fighter V less go
[0:25:55] <+DatAsuna> fire
[0:26:04] <%Dr00_PhD> ew ed theme
[0:26:14] <white0devil0> aaaand DMCAd
[0:26:18] <dds333a> @dr00_phd LUL LUL
[0:26:22] <Deyne_547> edminem in da house!!!
[0:26:28] <Deko_> boy haven't heard this song in a long while
[0:26:28] <dds333a> LUL
[0:26:29] <+Mordexai_> PLAY ELEVEN YOU COWARDS
[0:26:35] <%Shad0wTag> ED'S THEME IS STILL FIRE
[0:26:37] <%townzzzzz> when SF does vocal songs LUL
[0:26:38] <Deyne_547> ed's theme is nice
[0:26:41] <zebrad0n> Lighting looks good fellas! Reggies camera looks a lil washed out but not too shabby when it's been cropped
[0:26:44] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:26:52] <floralkami> @leith_aziz same, but i can see investors going for that more than the edge filled "virus-caused corporate dystopia"
[0:26:54] <legacy0117> You meant Street Fighter 5. Anyway we in it.
[0:27:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so many SFV memories, for example 90% of the memory slot is taken by Menat wiggle
[0:27:07] <%gulthrax> future!
[0:27:19] <Deyne_547> @townzzzzz RASHIDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:27:20] <+samuraiknack> Play Cruz Brothers you cowards
[0:27:20] <TigerClaws12> popeye arms
[0:27:20] <fuji_n2> Luke Fighter V
[0:27:21] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> why are his forearms so big?
[0:27:25] <+patrickng714> Popeye arms
[0:27:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:27:27] <dds333a> I love Gai Tendo
[0:27:29] <%LastHazzerd> shoulders down i do not mind him
[0:27:29] <%gulthrax> hes got those Popeye forearms
[0:27:32] <bleugh> all those plus frames lost in time
[0:27:33] <%leith_aziz> Woolie, it's fine. Dont feel like shit about it
[0:27:39] <+Mordexai_> Gai Tendo is a good character
[0:27:40] <%asakura_ayase> I thought 3rd Strike was the future of SF
[0:27:42] <+samuraiknack> Look at his fucking feet
[0:27:46] <+DatAsuna> yeah you can name JP MMA characters on one hand
[0:27:48] <voodoolawyer> quite suckable those toes
[0:27:52] <%leith_aziz> While I dont agree, I dont dismiss your opinion, nor should anyone
[0:28:01] <%LastHazzerd> if SFV didn't suck at hair
[0:28:02] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:28:04] <+MisterAvry> but what if he did MMA from a bed!
[0:28:07] <+TotesBurger> I just wish Luke had different hair...
[0:28:10] <+DatAsuna> Mila still best girl in DoA
[0:28:15] <fuji_n2> damn, you play SFV and the feet ppl just rise from the ground
[0:28:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[0:28:22] <primaryfire> I like the mma part of him but nothing else visually lmao
[0:28:24] <Deko_> reggie LUL
[0:28:28] <%Deft_Thought> Joe Rogan is gonna be the final boss of SFVI
[0:28:28] <TigerClaws12> cause martial arts can only thrive and be celebrated in fighting games
[0:28:36] <%LastHazzerd> like genuinely SFV's hair design is real bad
[0:28:43] <%leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus Woolie, it's fine. Dont feel like shit about it. While I dont agree, I dont dismiss your opinion, nor should anyone.
[0:28:52] <TheQuadrupleS> the hair is the worst part of the design
[0:28:55] <+Ether101_Prime> The problem his design has some colors out of place.
[0:29:07] <%Plus_On_Black> Word on God, fuck most people.
[0:29:25] <+MisterAvry> god damn he has muscular feet
[0:29:31] <dds333a> @plus_on_black welcome to the club
[0:29:37] <fuji_n2> every Luke costume is better than the og, is my only real complain
[0:29:39] <+MisterAvry> I guess ryu does too
[0:29:39] <LGeier> I don't get the Luke hate, I feel like he fits perfectly in SFV
[0:29:41] <+Dova573> hes motion right?
[0:30:05] <%LastHazzerd> @LGeier purely visual
[0:30:05] <dds333a> not at all
[0:30:08] <%leith_aziz> I think Luke's actor is the same as Anji's. That's nice
[0:30:14] <%Cozy90> FAT
[0:30:30] <Deyne_547> I heard luke is top tier in this game
[0:30:41] <Deyne_547> or high tier at worst
[0:30:44] <dds333a> essentially
[0:30:51] <%leith_aziz> @LGeier While I dont really care for Luke much, this is kinda why I dont bother with chat on that. Everyone's gonna have varying opinions, so it feels pointless
[0:30:56] <Estwilde> they really just gave him a dp with no hops
[0:31:26] <+samuraiknack> The fucking state of those feet. You can tell there are no foot fetishists at Capcom
[0:31:30] <legacy0117> So who dis? Like, he does not feel anything like street fighter or capcom. Didn’t Able kind of fit this character role already?
[0:31:48] <LGeier> @LGeier I suppose, I really like his look so I guess haha.  Also fair, folks just can't go "I don't like how this looks" compared to "I don't think this should be"
[0:31:53] <dds333a> He is the future
[0:31:58] <%leith_aziz> The reason for the big hands and feet is for highlighting where the opponent attacks
[0:32:10] <mothdude> Street Fighter 6 currently in development
[0:32:20] <%leith_aziz> Personally, I prefer how Strive just gives everyone gloves to highlight it. Looks more drippy
[0:32:28] <Deyne_547> @samuraiknack hands and feet are exaggerated in size for all characters so you can better see it while playing or watching
[0:32:28] <dds333a> really hold that
[0:32:54] <ThunderShift91> the thing that bothers me about his design is his pants. They are doing this odd billowing thing around his thighs.
[0:32:57] <LGeier> @samuraiknack Superior giant fists for maximum damage
[0:32:57] <dds333a> clearly
[0:32:58] <Invess> Jago
[0:33:01] <%townzzzzz> alextears.mp5
[0:33:12] <Deyne_547> Jago for ki
[0:33:21] <%jinking79> he has Kyo Japanese voice ?
[0:33:21] <Invess> @townzzzzz alex is good this season, he shouldn't be cryin
[0:33:31] <primaryfire> basically a level 3
[0:33:33] <Deyne_547> ky and sol for guilty gear
[0:33:43] <wingedplague> so is Luke just mma anime Popeye?
[0:33:54] <%gulthrax> he'll be the main character for like 5 minutes then Ryu will eventually brush him aside
[0:34:00] <%townzzzzz> @Invess not gameplay wise, main character wise
[0:34:01] <Deyne_547> jin kisargi and ragna the edgelord for blazblue
[0:34:09] <dds333a> @gulthrax classic LUL
[0:34:16] <%gulthrax> @dds333a LUL
[0:34:22] <LGeier> @wingedplague LUL It'd be a great costume
[0:34:39] <legacy0117> Weird his forearms inflate like Luffy from One Piece? That’s strange.
[0:34:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1468148034802532354?t=ufv885ONB9gNiHU8rEm7rw&s=19

[1:41:35] <JohnXuandou> he's ex-military so I would imagine he's early 20's
[1:41:44] <%dds333a> to be fair, I know plenty of people in their 30s that wear braces, just not in his profession LUL
[1:42:24] <%LordRocca> Man that stage is good.
[1:42:34] <+RJay80> i mean suppressor seems like its mostly designed to counter grapples so this isnt a mu you would it so its a lil weird

[1:42:57] <DSD24> Better Ed
[1:42:58] <%dds333a> it works
[1:42:59] <JohnXuandou> I don't think you can kick the front of the knee in MMA
[1:43:12] <+TheApproachingSnom> What Ed should have been
[1:43:18] <%dds333a> absolutely destroy your standing game LUL
[1:43:19] <+RJay80> until you condition a player to tech grabs so yea
[1:43:22] <DSD24> Ed would have been cooler if he was more slim instead of all buff

[1:46:08] <JohnXuandou> Ed is way too jacked to be even halfway to twink
[1:46:12] <+RJay80> st hp is a very whip punishing button
[1:46:57] <ChoculaUltra> I just never really liked the proportions of the SFV cast. It all looks so wonky still, even after all these years.

[1:56:10] <legacy0117> Also look at that stat frame, Luke literally has no low stats.
[1:56:21] <leomuratore> woolieYIKES
[1:56:25] <legacy0117> Derp.
[1:57:02] <+EchoXOF> @cobalt_phoenix_  technically yes, although its implementation has lots of room for improvement. Don't expect Strive's netcode though.
[1:57:16] <%dds333a> gimme a birdie
[1:57:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:57:33] <legacy0117> Birdie stop biting the chains it’s way too weird.
[1:58:30] <legacy0117> That reach though.
[1:58:31] <+fizzguy47> waht does activating vtrigger do? is it like Rage Art in Tekken?
[1:58:55] <%dds333a> no, it's more like changes to the character
[1:59:00] <clapbeatt> it varies per character
[1:59:09] <clapbeatt> usually it makes existing moves better
[1:59:15] <clapbeatt> or gives them new moves
[1:59:25] <+RJay80> vt is more or less a temporary buff
[1:59:28] <+fizzguy47> like an install, I see
[1:59:30] <%dds333a> used mid match, meter permitting
[1:59:47] <+fizzguy47> and it unlocks the super moves?
[2:00:05] <legacy0117> Probably either adds damage, armor, or verabalism type stuff.
[2:00:19] <+RJay80> certain vt unlocks different special moves yes
[2:00:35] <Rojahh> @woolieversus GGs my guys
[2:00:39] <+RJay80> keeeeeeen

[2:03:18] <legacy0117> X3 No, anything but the Britishhh!
[2:03:41] <+fizzguy47> I always thought that V-trigger also cancelled recovery like RC in Strive
[2:03:49] <legacy0117> A fate worse than death some say.
[2:04:00] <%dds333a> uh oh
[2:04:13] <+RJay80> @fizzguy47 it does
[2:04:18] <primaryfire> you can't vtrigger cancel all moves tho

[2:05:41] <+RJay80> yeah only vt2 has unlimited timer @woolieversus
[2:06:11] <Arqartur0> So, is Luke related to Guile, or is he an original character?
[2:06:34] <primaryfire> guile was luke's superior when he was in the military but otherwise unrelated
[2:06:37] <%dds333a> that's three times LUL
[2:06:39] <legacy0117> That hair would get in the way so much, but it floats when he gets mad so it’s fine.
[2:06:41] <Arqartur0> ahh
[2:06:42] <+RJay80> original character
[2:07:10] <%townzzzzz> just a guy with big arms
[2:07:24] <Aussie_Manny> So Guile knew Luke's father?
[2:07:26] <%dds333a> he didn't necessarily mean by blood LUL

[2:11:01] <+BananaSlammuh> They have so much power to release
[2:11:03] <legacy0117> No. That’s why folks keep yelling that this character is popeye.
[2:11:06] <BurdRightsActivist> He has the smt 4 Lucifer arms
[2:11:10] <+FormerOrc> think the glow just makes them more obvious

[2:29:16] <Aussie_Manny> SF6 is gonna be a terabyte at least.
[2:29:21] <Arqartur0> Meanwhile, Guilty Gear Cares... But that's because they use Autodesk.
[2:29:23] <$Noponis> actually the issue with sfv is that they bundle all the files into like 10gb packs so the tiniest update is huge
[2:29:32] <leomuratore> @pupil31 already miss those times
[2:29:35] <+orochiblood> Im excited for the next KOF beta, cant believe they brought back K9999.

[2:42:44] <Invess> @Octopimp I thought the same thing and yet I saw it pop up a lot at CEO

[2:43:27] <leomuratore> LUL
[2:43:30] <Arqartur0> I think the charming thing of SF is that the characters are iconic in the culture they want to portray... Sometimes, it can be a hit or miss; they are, design-wise, different from KoF which are more stylish/casual looking.
[2:43:31] <%dds333a> oh here we go
[2:43:54] <marcomatame> @mrtanaka111 Alex is so cool why do they sleep on him
[2:44:09] <Invess> @mrtanaka111 they said Abel and Rasihd were the protagonists of their games so they got a pretty loose definition
[2:44:22] <mrtanaka111> they said necallis was a big deal

[2:54:26] <leomuratore> Party people
[2:54:31] <@Solidus_113> I don't have the braincells for Chaos
[2:54:32] <Josef_Stryker> I was hoping I'd also get to play Strive against him but no crossplay
[2:54:41] <Josef_Stryker> Plus my Potemkin is super-rusty anyhow
[2:54:42] <%gulthrax> atpQuan focus chi
[2:54:44] <SofterCrash> the combo videos are cool tho
[2:54:44] <Arqartur0> and then the mine crystals in SF X Tekken
[2:54:46] <%Sparkseid> HC takes maximum brain power
[2:54:53] <%Shad0wTag> You need to legit LAB
[2:54:56] <%Shad0wTag> to be HC
[2:55:03] <Josef_Stryker> CHAOS
[2:55:04] <%baka_sugoi> Played training mode to play GUN and felt like csbeastSetIn if i was in a real match
[2:55:10] <yukichocomilk> deb is a good happy chaos to learn from
[2:55:25] <mrtanaka111> is luke the last character?like no more after him?
[2:55:27] <%jinking79> i had to set HS to R2 for Chaos
[2:55:32] <+polothegreatest> True chaos is smashing all buttons and 360 the stick
[2:55:45] <leomuratore> REally?! Damn.
[2:55:50] <jl_arts> Just like a real gun, frame one
[2:55:56] <Josef_Stryker> Can Potemkin deflect the bullets?
[2:55:59] <Josef_Stryker> No?
[2:56:20] <%baka_sugoi> i don't think pot can beat gun
[2:56:32] <leomuratore> Has that guy already made a video if Chaos can beat Sol's special?
[2:56:33] <%Shad0wTag> Happy Chaos is a Xrd Character in disguise
[2:56:34] <SofterCrash> maybe two shots?
[2:56:37] <marcomatame> tbh Happy Chaos and Zato should be at least a tad bit stronger, they take too much effort
[2:56:39] <%Juriasu> mirror match intro is SICK
[2:56:46] <aka_Jigawatt> MF Daps himself
[2:56:59] <yukichocomilk> "I'll be the protag" "I guess I'll be the villain"
[2:57:01] <+Das_Prints> Armor stuffs shots unless you shoot them again. Basically armor counters his full aim shots really hard
[2:57:02] <Saltmeisterr> ohhhh, thats a nie jacket u got there
[2:57:03] <%baka_sugoi> @Shad0wTag he's Elphelt 1.0 Xrd
[2:57:03] <marcomatame> Jack-O too
[2:57:14] <SofterCrash> arcade is also "wait what?"
[2:57:21] <%townzzzzz> why isn't sol vs ky intro them just pulling the swords out of the ground
[2:57:22] <leomuratore> Special intros add a lot to a game
[2:57:31] <primaryfire> he just pats everyone on the shoulder which happens to look like a high five in mirrors but the unique lines are cool
[2:57:32] <jl_arts> pot armor does work against the gun, 2 shots to beat it
[2:57:32] <sappmaster> all dlc character for strive are mad fun
[2:57:38] <%Shad0wTag> @Shad0wTag and still not anywhere near as toxic
[2:57:39] <zenith0111> and all DLCs hard lose to Axl
[2:57:40] <+Das_Prints> He has like no defensive reversals so he has a hard time with pressure it seems.
[2:57:52] <white0devil0> How do we think that Baiken might be reworked give how Jack-O was changed?
[2:57:56] <%pupil31> G U N KKona
[2:58:01] <$Noponis> HC seems much harder than elphelt, she didnt really have any management to her gunstuff
[2:58:24] <zenith0111> Elphelt was a Gorilla so thats a fair assessment
[2:58:35] <+Das_Prints> She mainly just had a lot of motion requirements for cocking the guns after each shot.
[2:58:48] <mrtanaka111> happy chaos is less and more fun than i expected
[2:58:51] <SaintSalted> he seems kinda OD
[2:58:55] <zenith0111> Eplphelts bridal bouquet was her real menace
[2:59:33] <primaryfire> deb, the evo champion, seems to really like him
[2:59:36] <yukichocomilk> @WoolieVersus deb also plays a lot of happy chaos
[2:59:36] <SofterCrash> and the aiming orb
[2:59:55] <+dr_steve1790> Woolie Quote of The Day: Guys if you really want a lesson in blackness play Detroit: Become Human. David will tell you how.
[3:00:04] <zenith0111> Debs even tweeted theyre going to jump off Sol for Happy
[3:00:21] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[3:00:43] <%Juriasu> 2 stars huh
[3:00:56] <%Irridium> he seems scary but honestly if you run up on him there's not too much he can do
[3:01:00] <zenith0111> lower stars means harder to use
[3:01:00] <%Shad0wTag> his theme is DOPE
[3:01:05] <marcomatame> Anybody else can't pull off Jack-O's command grab super with any consistency? I always misinput into the minion command and i mald

[3:04:46] <DedlokPM> @aka_Jigawatt he had nothing on his chest either until he killed a security guard and took his jacket
[3:04:46] <%Shad0wTag> WHAT A BOP
[3:04:47] <%baka_sugoi> f e e t NotLikeThis
[3:04:53] <+Das_Prints> The ammo cylinder being at the end of the barrel is so silly.
[3:04:54] <+erictables> HE DON'T MISS
[3:05:03] <+Cybercobra2> now people might mistake him for a zoner, hes not. hes super not a zoner becouse while his gun is frame 1, it doesnt do that much damage and you cannot block. caracters WILL just get in on you.
[3:05:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> says you ^
[3:05:34] <primaryfire> the zato muscle memory coming in handy
[3:05:56] <%Shad0wTag> @Das_Prints its a make believe gun
[3:05:57] <zenith0111> You know hes not a zoner because against Axl he cant do shit
[3:06:03] <+invalid_robin> It's negative edge
[3:06:05] <AllenDeadman> cottonwSmile he sure that
[3:06:07] <%baka_sugoi> S T I C K
[3:06:08] <AllenDeadman> does*
[3:06:12] <emptyantics> How’s he liking Happy Chaos?
[3:06:18] <KogaNoidZX> I already play stick in this game anyway lmao
[3:06:24] <Aussie_Manny> controller-specific characters. bruh.
[3:06:26] <AllenDeadman> @emptyantics still feeling out
[3:06:31] <DedlokPM> @emptyantics just started messing with him so can't say
[3:06:35] <marcomatame> Honestly, I think Happy Chaos is easier to handle than Jack-O, his barrier for entry is harder to get through, but doing things effectively with him is less execution intensive, i think
[3:06:36] <gunstars20> tekken fingers Let's go
[3:06:39] <+Das_Prints> @cybercobra2 I’ve seen some wild keep away stuff with him using the clone and full aim. If you are good at it you get reload or focus between full aim pop ups and keep up some long ranged pressure.
[3:06:41] <LiquidBinge> Does anyone else take psychic damage from how HC wears his jacket half-off?
[3:06:42] <%Juriasu> AngelThump
[3:06:46] <Aussie_Manny> BURNING
[3:06:49] <KogaNoidZX> I'm sure you can play him fine on pad, it's just way easier with a controller where the layout is better
[3:07:06] <nobody045133> @emptyantics The song hasnt looped yet for reference on how long he's played him for LUL
[3:07:11] <KogaNoidZX> I know Blazblue players that make top 8 with a guitar hero controller lmao
[3:07:12] <zenith0111> @das_prints Its a very gimmicky style people are using
[3:07:13] <+Das_Prints> @shad0wtag that’s true but it is still pretty silly looking.
[3:07:16] <SofterCrash> It already hurts NotLikeThis
[3:07:22] <DedlokPM> @KogaNoidZX Which is what he basically meant by "better on pad" rooBlank
[3:07:26] <zenith0111> It has no long term stay
[3:07:40] <+Cybercobra2> @Das_Prints hmm, i havent been struggling yet as pot but that may be a matchup thing or i have not fought good chaos's yet
[3:07:58] <KogaNoidZX> Yeah true
[3:07:59] <%gulthrax> and i pull out my GUN!...
[3:08:15] <+Das_Prints> Pot is actually at advantage it seems against HC. Chaos doesn’t have a lot of answers for armor.
[3:08:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:08:35] <zenith0111> HC hard counters Pot
[3:08:41] <DedlokPM> @Das_Prints Octopimp certainly was eating Chaoses like popcorn when he was last streaming it
[3:09:01] <emptyantics> HC is one the weakest GG character designs NotLikeThis
[3:09:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> cuz its octo
[3:09:11] <+invalid_robin> He has some really, really tight combos
[3:09:12] <emptyantics> His gameplay seems fun though
[3:09:12] <SofterCrash> 236 S is a thing a see a lot
[3:09:13] <%Shad0wTag> @Das_Prints as a pot main thats some good news
[3:09:17] <nobody045133> SnakeEyez and Octopimp both said HC is a breeze for Pot
[3:09:19] <%townzzzzz> do the doppelganger move
[3:09:33] <+invalid_robin> 5K 2D 236S leads into some crazy combos
[3:09:33] <%Shad0wTag> Also English Happy Chaos is a lot of fun, Robbie Draymond does a great job as him
[3:09:37] <nobody045133> He has no defence to keep Pot out
[3:09:56] <+Das_Prints> @shad0wtag the only thing he kind of has is his super since firing the gun doesn’t track hammer fall fast enough that follow up shots will miss.
[3:10:03] <nobody045133> slidehead beats every move HC has too LUL
[3:10:29] <zenith0111> @nobody045133 You mean the move thats 50 frames in total and punishable on whiff?
[3:10:39] <%Shad0wTag> @Das_Prints fine by me, after the nightmare match ups Millia and Jack-O give me, I'll take what I can get
[3:10:59] <zenith0111> if you get hit by slide head thats not a MU thing
[3:11:19] <nobody045133> @zenith it means you cant do anything at long range. no gun spam
[3:11:42] <zenith0111> Thats like 1/5 of his kits style
[3:11:46] <+Das_Prints> @shad0wtag fair enough lol. But yeah Chaos has defensive issues he has no reversals and his super is not active immediately and is not invincible so you can just slap or grab him out of it.
[3:12:08] <+invalid_robin> The thing with HC is that his damage and reward are HUGE
[3:12:16] <%Shad0wTag> @Das_Prints He's definitely the character where individuality gets to shine though thats for sure
[3:12:17] <zenith0111> ^
[3:12:19] <+invalid_robin> He has 300 damage combos pretty easy
[3:12:21] <+Das_Prints> @invalid_robin yeah it’s so fun.
[3:12:24] <zenith0111> The damage is stupid real
[3:12:38] <+invalid_robin> Like he will KILL you if he gets a CH 6P
[3:12:39] <SofterCrash> 3 shots and reload i think?
[3:12:46] <+Das_Prints> @shad0wtag definitely. That head bounce shot combo he can do is so goofy.
[3:12:57] <+lag2993> 2 shots combo into super
[3:13:14] <+invalid_robin> I know Deb switched over to HC and has been just been doing big damage
[3:13:23] <%Shad0wTag> @Das_Prints And he's got that Iori cross up kick as well that looks dirty
[3:13:26] <zenith0111> Gun has to be manually put away tho or else youre wide open
[3:13:31] <bosssbatttle> HC can do some insane damage
[3:13:36] <%Rojahh> Man screw this I'm going back to Potemkin
[3:13:36] <+Das_Prints> You can do focus real fast between shot or reload on steady aim to refund the shot or get a tiny bit of focus back to get an extra full aim shot off.
[3:13:42] <marcomatame> Everybody loves the Disney Princess part of the song
[3:13:44] <+lag2993> hc has crazy dmg and a true 50 that they have to guess
[3:13:58] <+lag2993> from round start
[3:14:03] <+erictables> Scapegoat works a lot like Zato's oppress if you're standing infront of it
[3:14:17] <%Shad0wTag> @Rojahh stay with the church of pot my brother, never is there a reason to leave
[3:14:24] <zenith0111> Im sorry to inform spamming Steady Aim is not a good long form plan
[3:14:29] <+invalid_robin> You can shoot during the roll I thought?
[3:14:30] <+erictables> You can shoot during the roll
[3:14:34] <+Das_Prints> His clone is at least nice for stopping dash attack moves like viper and hammer fall.
[3:14:44] <zenith0111> He shoot during any animation
[3:14:50] <marcomatame> It took him 10 years to find the answer to something, you took 10 and couldn't even find some bitches. *Plays Chaos drip remix*

[3:14:51] <+Das_Prints> You can shoot during the roll it just resets the aim during the start of the roll.
[3:15:06] <+invalid_robin> Try holding HS and then release?
[3:15:14] <%townzzzzz> throw a curse out
[3:15:20] <+erictables> Curse is great for roll+shoot
[3:15:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:15:24] <zenith0111> Curse + Roll for crossups
[3:15:30] <zenith0111> Curse is dumb btw
[3:15:35] <zenith0111> hate curse
[3:15:46] <SofterCrash> put away gun and take out the gun again?
[3:15:48] <$SilverRoddo> Put Steady-Aim as your perk 4Head
[3:15:50] <%andrewofbob> So, it's Arakune with a gun?
[3:15:57] <+lag2993> i think the hit stun of fire last through roll into fire
[3:16:10] <zenith0111> So fun fact Happy Chaos gun has RNG
[3:16:12] <marcomatame> @zenith0111 I mean, if Curse was the Default accuracy rate for Chaos, he'd be top-tier lmao
[3:16:18] <zenith0111> Curse exists to help the RNG
[3:16:33] <+lag2993> hc is already top tier he has broken stuff like actually broken
[3:17:00] <+NYCrownlessKing> someone on twitter found out with scapegoat, you can juggle them against it like an aganos wall because the player won't fly THROUGH it @WoolieVersus
[3:17:07] <+NYCrownlessKing> so it has that insane wall  tech lol
[3:17:10] <%jinking79> it a wall
[3:17:12] <+invalid_robin> Nope, Mortobato beats Scapegoat
[3:17:24] <marcomatame> @lag2993 ummm, d}he also has a lot of very big weaknesses, but im a casual, so idk if  top-level players can easily negate those weaknesses
[3:17:26] <+Das_Prints> They can’t walk through the clone.
[3:17:42] <+NYCrownlessKing> exactly @WoolieVersus
[3:17:42] <jl_arts> you can do some small wall combos midscreen
[3:17:44] <fangovafang> wats good yall LuvPeekL
[3:17:51] <+NYCrownlessKing> no wall bounce or splatter.
[3:17:55] <+NYCrownlessKing> so the perfect wall
[3:17:57] <zenith0111> You can roll through the clone
[3:18:04] <+lag2993> @marcomatame  he can set you up in wall stun from any hit into a true 50 50
[3:18:25] <%jinking79> Faust long range will hit the clone first
[3:18:30] <marcomatame> Woolie, walk in front of a clone and let Reggie punch you, you gonna see some rad shit
[3:18:43] <+lag2993> first character to actually break the game with the wall prob will be patched
[3:18:45] <zenith0111> Faust seems to do very well against Happu
[3:18:54] <zenith0111> His teleport messes with his aim so much
[3:18:57] <+Das_Prints> I think the clone will eat nago’s standing heavies so he can’t cut you through it like he can with fireballs.
[3:19:16] <zenith0111> Seems like thw lower tier characters do much better against Happy
[3:19:19] <bosssbatttle> the clone eats everything its fucking crazy
[3:19:21] <marcomatame> @lag2993 Oh yeah that's crazy strong
[3:19:37] <KogaNoidZX> I don't think clone beats Nago's clone though, could be wrong
[3:19:39] <+lag2993> @marcomatame  and its a constant meterless 50 50 loop until death
[3:19:43] <+Das_Prints> Goldlewis sky fish does not respect the clone though. Tears through it and hits Chaos immediately.
[3:19:48] <zenith0111> Nagos Clone Wins
[3:20:13] <%jinking79> the closest to Venom in the game
[3:20:31] <marcomatame> This is making me want to play Chaos rn ngl
[3:20:42] <marcomatame> im terrible at it but he's mad fun
[3:20:56] <%Irridium> he can be knocked the fuck out of that super yeah
[3:20:57] <SofterCrash> It will also rplenish all your bullets
[3:20:58] <%LastHazzerd> Deus Ex Machina is a phrase that caries a helluva lot more weight in this setting
[3:21:12] <+Deasmeister> If you tap him it cancels it
[3:21:13] <+erictables> During the animation for super, if you input down + H anytime during the super, you automatically put the gun away once the super end. Saves up remaining concentration.
[3:21:31] <zenith0111> Let the reticle fully aim for bigger damage and juggles
[3:21:40] <+lag2993> the hardest thing i find about him is canceling the gun during combos and block strings
[3:21:41] <zenith0111> Its honestly one of the best supers in the game
[3:21:43] <+invalid_robin> It's a guts shredder
[3:21:49] <+Das_Prints> This dude gets easy wall breaks like no one’s business.
[3:21:56] <+invalid_robin> Deals a good amount of damage to high guts characters
[3:22:28] <Arqartur0> Well, I'm off, gonna pick up my brother and his girlfriend from the airport; see ya guys later, enjoy the game :)
[3:22:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:22:42] <Smitteys867> is this Woolies first time playing with HC?
[3:23:02] <%Shad0wTag> @Smitteys867 yes he hasn't played in months
[3:23:03] <+Das_Prints> qcf+S pops them up and you can follow up with steady aim shot immediately after.
[3:23:09] <zenith0111> Steady Aim into Roll for conversions
[3:23:20] <yukichocomilk> his combos are nuts
[3:23:21] <%LastHazzerd> oh yeah, it's big brain time
[3:23:25] <+Das_Prints> He has some flashy stuff involving steady aim roll cancels.
[3:24:16] <+erictables> Scapegoat only takes one hit so projectiles like Leo's will stuff it easy
[3:24:30] <+Das_Prints> It has super fast recovery.
[3:24:40] <zenith0111> Chaos doesnt like multi hitting characters
[3:24:41] <+Das_Prints> The focus super I mean.
[3:24:55] <zenith0111> Gios will plow through his Clone
[3:25:09] <+Das_Prints> The little fire around the heart on the meter tells you the buff duration.
[3:25:46] <zenith0111> Super Focus refills the bar completely even when red and empty
[3:26:02] <SofterCrash> cancel gun mid combo and take it out again
[3:26:15] <%townzzzzz> always let that intro rock
[3:26:29] <%jinking79> watch his IK have the car
[3:26:39] <jl_arts> best intro
[3:26:45] <%Juriasu> LUL
[3:26:53] <mrtanaka111> what a cool guy
[3:26:56] <AllenDeadman> his interaction with himself is the best
[3:27:00] <DDDorsett> Sup Oomfie
[3:28:04] <%townzzzzz> BANG
[3:28:09] <zenith0111> This is the Happy mirrors in a nutshell
[3:28:15] <mrtanaka111> bang bang
[3:28:17] <zenith0111> Fullcreen steady aim spam
[3:28:17] <%jinking79> hold buttons for different gun spin Animation
[3:28:26] <+fizzguy47> HC is 2 meters too much 4 me
[3:28:42] <zenith0111> 3* if you count tension
[3:28:50] <zenith0111> 4* if Burst
[3:29:01] <AllenDeadman> think fast cottonwSmile
[3:29:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> this screen just looks like two  ppl playing a light gun shooter over a fighting game
[3:29:15] <+NYCrownlessKing> LUL
[3:29:27] <%andrewofbob> Health, Burst, RISC, tension, bullets, concentration
[3:30:02] <%LastHazzerd> wait does the side the wheel is on change for p1 and p2?
[3:30:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1468148034802532354?t=ufv885ONB9gNiHU8rEm7rw&s=19
[3:30:09] <%andrewofbob> And there's the hidden negative meter
[3:30:17] <jl_arts> that iori kick
[3:30:17] <+fizzguy47> @lasthazzerd yes
[3:30:23] <%LastHazzerd> @fizzguy47 that's hilarious
[3:30:28] <Saltmeisterr> @andrewofbob the what
[3:30:52] <zenith0111> Banana Gun is canon in my mind
[3:31:13] <+fizzguy47> @zenith0111 there will be mods
[3:31:19] <+Das_Prints> He’s so cool
[3:31:20] <%andrewofbob> Too many avoidant actions like backdashing and you end up in negative penalty
[3:31:48] <mrtanaka111> what archetype is he? i dont really consider hima  zoner
[3:31:53] <Saltmeisterr> oh right neg penalty
[3:31:56] <Saltmeisterr> @mrtanaka111 g u n
[3:31:57] <SofterCrash> that's where the super comes in handy with the reload
[3:32:00] <mrtanaka111> gun
[3:32:14] <AllenDeadman> shame
[3:32:14] <zenith0111> @mrtanaka111 Stance? All his pressure and utility is all from his stance
[3:32:27] <zenith0111> Outside of Gun stance hes meh
[3:32:33] <mrtanaka111> @zenith0111 that makes sense
[3:32:34] <emptyantics> Can’t wait to see Baiken’s changes
[3:32:38] <%baka_sugoi> BANG
[3:32:45] <primaryfire> distinct lack of Large Sword
[3:32:47] <Zebroneath> banyaCHAKA banyaCHAKA
[3:32:51] <TheQuadrupleS> This characters is super cool but such a pain to fight LUL I hate and respect those folks LUL
[3:32:57] <%LastHazzerd> COUNTER
[3:33:13] <emptyantics> Doesn’t he have a touch of death?
[3:33:34] <zenith0111> Strive enables the cast to TOD on a whim
[3:33:36] <jl_arts> Pressing some different buttons will change his winning animation @WoolieVersus
[3:33:37] <+FormerOrc> I don't know why, but his lack of shoes infuriates me
[3:33:54] <SofterCrash> Max was playing a rythm game with this guy's combos
[3:34:17] <emptyantics> I just don’t like his design at all
[3:34:22] <%JetpackMcQuack> There’s always an opening
[3:34:41] <pmmori> I thought his standing low was his party starter
[3:35:13] <mrtanaka111> two sécónds
[3:35:21] <zenith0111> His 5k 6k gatlings into each other
[3:35:35] <emptyantics> It’s crazy seeing how he plays so slow and methodical and how fast and ractive the Gunslinger from DNF plays
[3:35:42] <%JetpackMcQuack> 6K > H > repeat
[3:36:22] <zenith0111> no its 5k 6k h
[3:36:28] <%JetpackMcQuack> All moves are good
[3:36:34] <SaiyanShoto> It’s funny how the game calls him a gunslinger but he doesn’t really seem like one
[3:36:45] <SofterCrash> spamming all your bullets after a hit confirm doesn't do that much damage
[3:36:48] <emptyantics> @saiyanshoto Yeah it’s weird lol
[3:36:49] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:37:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> There’s in-chaos and out-chaos
[3:37:29] <%baka_sugoi> no clones?
[3:37:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:39:02] <+Das_Prints> Steady aim-reload works pretty well for keeping out fukyo
[3:39:03] <fangovafang> u can probably dodge those shots wit dat dash
[3:39:07] <%Shad0wTag> honourable sword vs dishonourable gun
[3:39:09] <%townzzzzz> ignite your rusty heart
[3:39:16] <+FormerOrc> wait a minute...happy chaos is spaghetti western Jesus?
[3:39:22] <%HeroToxiko> GUN
[3:39:28] <%JetpackMcQuack> Fuck yea
[3:39:29] <SofterCrash> GUN?
[3:39:31] <+Jays_Son_Voorhees> Hearing the "Let's Rock" makes me want to see Al Bundy as a guest character, and/or The Man from Another Place from Twin Peaks.
[3:39:35] <%baka_sugoi> G U N
[3:39:37] <%Shad0wTag> @FormerOrc I mean sorta
[3:39:37] <%andrewofbob> Blood rage = don't you dare draw your gun
[3:39:44] <TheQuadrupleS> Think HARDER Reggie
[3:39:49] <+Das_Prints> Oh did they make Nago’s clone faster?
[3:40:06] <marcomatame> @Das_Prints yeah, since October i think
[3:40:17] <SofterCrash> eat a clone
[3:40:21] <+Das_Prints> Nice. I was mailing him but haven’t played much since like September
[3:40:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> Clones are interference
[3:40:48] <TheQuadrupleS> Clones stop HMC LUL
[3:40:55] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL

[3:41:28] <fangovafang> Looks like a fun matchup
[3:41:30] <SofterCrash> One gauge is enough for Woolie
[3:41:31] <yukichocomilk> booba
[3:41:39] <double_zr_tap> Y'all are fun to watch
[3:41:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> Am I a cursed beast
[3:41:53] <%pupil31> The Baiken Community celebrating
[3:42:11] <+fizzguy47> will baiken have  a Tatami meter
[3:42:16] <+FormerOrc> as long as she can stomp tatami mats, everything will be okay
[3:42:16] <%LastHazzerd> Bushido, dignified. It's the last stand of the samurai
[3:42:22] <%JetpackMcQuack> How uncivilized
[3:42:38] <SofterCrash> Grab the clone
[3:42:51] <Enn19> M-MASAKA
[3:42:53] <%baka_sugoi> mini wall LUL
[3:42:54] <%townzzzzz> STOP THE DASH/BLADE
[3:42:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> Pop
[3:43:17] <%LastHazzerd> goddamn props to Strive, the new characters are great
[3:43:53] <marcomatame> I think Nago's my favorite character to fight, as a Ky main, it feels like a boss fight, lmao
[3:44:25] <Saltmeisterr> the fuck reggie?

[3:45:06] <zenith0111> Since I play Axl I just poke through clone
[3:46:03] <%LastHazzerd> can nago's sword hit both the clone and chaos?
[3:46:11] <zenith0111> No
[3:46:26] <SofterCrash> the clone eats the hit i think?
[3:46:28] <zenith0111> But they can still special cancle and gatling when they hit it
[3:46:31] <+fizzguy47> its like Oppose?
[3:46:44] <zenith0111> Basically
[3:46:45] <%JetpackMcQuack> It eats your hitbox
[3:46:53] <+Dova573> Chaos with the well acktualky
[3:46:53] <%LastHazzerd> okay
[3:46:55] <zenith0111> LMAO
[3:46:59] <ElPlasa> You do have time to super HC's super, it's very tight tho
[3:47:02] <+dr_steve1790> Sword Vs. Gun
[3:47:16] <+OroOreo> Garfield you had Burst
[3:47:37] <emptyantics> 100000 million folded katana vs Banana gun
[3:47:52] <yukichocomilk> that was a nice confirm
[3:47:56] <%InvisiblessedReptile> Happy Chaos has some crazy match ups
[3:48:00] <%LastHazzerd> RC battles!
[3:48:08] <+Dova573> should have bursted would have made him pop the blood
[3:48:56] <+gatdragon> I really do love just how goofy happy chaos acts
[3:49:00] <%andrewofbob> I do want to see how HC fares against blood rage
[3:49:07] <%HeroToxiko> Happy chaos is what would happen if the song chiraq was a fighting game character
[3:49:21] <%Irridium> @andrewofbob if he doesn't get hit with the blood burst just gotta shoot and win
[3:49:58] <%andrewofbob> Needs to be a clean combo without blocking
[3:50:05] <%InvisiblessedReptile> But man, Woolie is so scary with Nago
[3:50:25] <%andrewofbob> Pop blood when the gun resources arn't there and it's a different game
[3:50:53] <primaryfire> what does he say during the super?
[3:51:01] <mrtanaka111> damn 5-0
[3:51:03] <+call_me_comic> online today or just smacking up reggie?
[3:51:10] <drstrangevoice> i chose the BEST WAY to see gameplay of strive.
[3:51:34] <drstrangevoice> im not even super into fighting games but this THIS looks good
[3:51:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:51:52] <yukichocomilk> yeah this game is great to watch
[3:52:02] <%JetpackMcQuack> Every time you draw your gun you might get a free combo
[3:52:59] <%Irridium> yep LUL
[3:53:01] <%andrewofbob> Gun ready, dead blood rage
[3:53:08] <%InvisiblessedReptile> To be fair, Woolie and Reggie are good entertainers, they narrate what they're doing and their thoughts, I learn a lot from them
[3:53:56] <drstrangevoice> this is true. PROFESSIONAL fighting game commentary.
[3:54:06] <Dante_Namikaze1> So close
[3:54:09] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:54:13] <Afrosamasenpai> big spaghetti
[3:55:05] <%JetpackMcQuack> And the goomba stomp too
[3:55:20] <%JetpackMcQuack> Pretty chaotic bro
[3:55:30] <kikosmore> lmao
[3:55:32] <+fizzguy47> Reggie is very conservative with the bullets
[3:55:44] <kikosmore> let's go lol
[3:55:45] <%InvisiblessedReptile> damn, nice
[3:55:47] <emptyantics> Reggie don’t be scared to use the bullets
[3:55:53] <%JetpackMcQuack> Zone that ass
[3:56:04] <+fizzguy47> i usualky just unload after the 236S
[3:56:55] <%InvisiblessedReptile> I think he is training this meter management with the bullets, the output is good when you just unload but you need to set it up again
[3:57:06] <%Nogopharo> Spam bullets and throw out random supers LUL
[3:57:08] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:57:25] <Afrosamasenpai> oh no big drops
[3:57:38] <%JetpackMcQuack> He brought a gun to a sword fight
[3:58:09] <Invess> The Last Samurai (2021, remake)
[3:58:42] <%InvisiblessedReptile> good range at start
[3:58:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1468148034802532354?t=ufv885ONB9gNiHU8rEm7rw&s=19
[3:58:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> Just play dirtier
[3:59:23] <yukichocomilk> nooo reggie had it
[3:59:36] <+Moodbone> Reggie with the patented chokes
[4:00:00] <fangovafang> Big slashes lol
[4:00:15] <yukichocomilk> he's doing really well though, the character is rough
[4:01:12] <FuzzyGuru> are they using sticks or controllers?
[4:01:13] <%InvisiblessedReptile> Does HC remove the need for Elphelt in the game?
[4:01:26] <%Demoli_PT> nothey pley very differently
[4:01:38] <%Demoli_PT> elphelt is a big stance gorilla with good setplay
[4:01:44] <%Demoli_PT> while HC is a pressure/zoner dude
[4:01:48] <%InvisiblessedReptile> I see
[4:01:53] <yukichocomilk> elphelt is waifu, we need that
[4:02:02] <krimsoncityogre> Happy Chaos adventures.
[4:02:21] <krimsoncityogre> I wouldn't Elphelt being added but Happy's gameplay is pretty great.
[4:02:24] <$Noponis> happy chaos is to elphelt as sol is to nagoryuki
[4:02:34] <$Noponis> they both have a gun witha  reticle but that is it
[4:02:47] <krimsoncityogre> I wonder how they would change her though? Since Happy has most of her kit.
[4:02:53] <zenith0111> Eplphelt had a fullscreen unblockable spier rifle that combo'd into itself @demoli_pt
[4:02:57] <+fizzguy47> the recovery on Nago 2S is so BS
[4:02:59] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[4:03:02] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[4:03:05] <Blind_Pro> are they planning on doing some online matches or just messing w HC
[4:03:06] <MidnightPacif1c> LUL
[4:03:13] <$Noponis> @krimsoncityogre what part of her kit? he has just about nothing she has
[4:03:14] <%Demoli_PT> i mean yeah elhpelt was bullshit, but the sniper wasnt zoning
[4:03:17] <%LastHazzerd> das Strive bby
[4:03:23] <Afrosamasenpai> big strive energy
[4:03:23] <%Demoli_PT> it was a yrc setup for an unblockable
[4:03:27] <yukichocomilk> don't lose hope reggie! LUL you're doing good
[4:03:43] <zenith0111> @demoli_pt Thats why she was Top 2. Johnny and Elphelt were good at any point on screen
[4:04:02] <zenith0111> Did everyones job better
[4:04:09] <%Demoli_PT> yeah absolutely, just saying she wasnt a zoner like HC can be
[4:04:14] <%LastHazzerd> i like HChaos' shield, GitS lookin' smiley
[4:04:18] <%Demoli_PT> they both have reticles but they behave differently
[4:04:25] <zenith0111> Elpehlts zoning was worse than HC
[4:04:30] <%RyTYoung> yoooo
[4:04:32] <krimsoncityogre> @krimsoncityogre The gun stance with the retcil, she had that with the sniper. Same with the quick reload and that.
[4:04:43] <fangovafang> pressure lol
[4:04:44] <+fizzguy47> Man popped twice in one match
[4:05:15] <$Noponis> elphelt had no actual reload, that is literally just going into another shot
[4:05:18] <$Noponis> there is no ammo to elphelt
[4:05:26] <+erictables> garfield you hadburst
[4:05:28] <+KingpinLarry> I just noticed the reboot symbol on Nagoryuki
[4:05:34] <krimsoncityogre> Yeah, the reload and the focus is new to Happy.
[4:05:48] <$Noponis> the sniper also works nothing like gun stnace
[4:05:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:05:51] <primaryfire> "who dares to enter the chaos" has a new meaning
[4:06:02] <BackflipCharm> I'm so glad they made a gun character who isn't just a zoner
[4:06:21] <%InvisiblessedReptile> But dude, my laptop is trash, the loading takes, like, 3x his loading
[4:06:21] <zenith0111> Most Gun characters are never zoners
[4:06:22] <yukichocomilk> squid game color
[4:06:26] <%LastHazzerd> i like this color matchup
[4:06:30] <PKSomething> its different intro quote if Chaos is player 1
[4:06:42] <Aussie_Manny> Which character is Woolie?
[4:06:46] <PKSomething> Nago
[4:06:51] <%InvisiblessedReptile> @Aussie_Manny He's playing as himself
[4:07:10] <SofterCrash> I thught he would have something to say to Axl given what he is
[4:07:22] <%LastHazzerd> Famous last words: "where are the bullets?"
[4:07:50] <krimsoncityogre> I think it does. With the whole waiting for the shot to ready.
[4:08:04] <krimsoncityogre> Ehh, I like both of'em though.
[4:08:54] <%andrewofbob> Zantetsuken is 11 frames pre-flash, 10 frames post-flash
[4:09:20] <%InvisiblessedReptile> I just want to say that there isn't a single uninteresting or boring character in this game.
[4:09:53] <+call_me_comic> @InvisiblessedReptile *cough*giovanna*cough*
[4:09:54] <zenith0111> Gios right there tho Kappa
[4:10:12] <+fizzguy47> @invisiblessedreptile i'd say Leo, but that's just salt talking
[4:10:24] <krimsoncityogre> I love Happy's air dust so much.
[4:10:28] <%InvisiblessedReptile> She's Brazilian, like me, and usually Brazilian characters are like Blanka, so she gets a pass
[4:10:28] <zenith0111> Yeah its boring losing :)
[4:10:43] <+call_me_comic> you wanna see a good giovanna check out valkenhern
[4:11:03] <marcomatame> niceeeee reggie
[4:11:06] <+wmeldrum> LET. ME. IN!
[4:11:06] <%townzzzzz> noice
[4:11:07] <+call_me_comic> the thematic joke is nago is the vampie and gio is the werewolf except shes just a fucking scummy frame monster

[4:11:12] <Afrosamasenpai> you did it
[4:11:13] <DedlokPM> @call_me_comic She literally has a doggo stand and a great design. I hardly would call her boring or unintresting
[4:11:17] <%andrewofbob> Tactical reload, baby!
[4:11:32] <+call_me_comic> @DedlokPM gameplay is the most important part of a video game
[4:11:37] <zenith0111> @call_me_comic Oh lol didnt put 1+1 together
[4:11:44] <FaxineiroDePosto> @call_me_comic what the dog doin tho? not much
[4:11:53] <+dr_steve1790> Bang
[4:11:55] <%Shad0wTag> @call_me_comic I think its because alot of people expected her to use her doggo in combat instead of like a scarf
[4:12:01] <zenith0111> Dog does a lot more than people meme about him
[4:12:02] <+call_me_comic> @call_me_comic dog has an obnoxious sweep and thats about it
[4:12:19] <zenith0111> Dog is activley attacking 70% of her mlves
[4:12:27] <+call_me_comic> gio has less gameplay sauce than vanessa who is just gio - doggo

[4:19:26] <%InvisiblessedReptile> @GunneryGoblin I bodied some HC today as Ram, but I loved playing against them, made me think a lot about my options
[4:19:34] <zenith0111> Has no one made the comparison of Homestuck to Happy Chaos?
[4:19:54] <SofterCrash> It would be funny if Chaos still said Bang bang, even when he has no bullets
[4:19:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:19:58] <SpookyBeef7> @zenith0111 Oh, there's already several Homestuck mods involving HC.

[4:23:30] <Invess> Doom is high iq, quit it
[4:23:32] <Afrosamasenpai> no think; big damage
[4:23:33] <+fizzguy47> @invisiblessedreptile true, I'm like anxious after getting to floor 9
[4:23:34] <zenith0111> Millia?
[4:24:04] <Wight_Trash> Highest IQ ive ever tried is Eyedol in KI, and i was a dumb guy anyway
[4:24:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I play Chipp, my IQ is floor level
[4:24:09] <Afrosamasenpai> @InvisiblessedReptile Don't worry. You'll get up there and get knocked back down. Half of the battle is knowing you got there.
[4:24:18] <+fizzguy47> does curse go away if you get hit?
[4:24:19] <Invess> 12 counts
[4:24:35] <%InvisiblessedReptile> @InvisiblessedReptile that's the grind I want to
[4:24:39] <zenith0111> Curse lasts 6 seconds its super hard to optimize
[4:24:44] <Wight_Trash> I guess Eyedol is more like 2 low IQ characters at once
[4:24:48] <SaiyanShoto> I play Sol so I have a crayon in my brain
[4:25:13] <GenericSoda> nah Sol is more technical now
[4:25:17] <+call_me_comic> where the lobby at

[4:25:45] <SaiyanShoto> @genericsoda really? Huh, I haven’t played him in a bit so I had no idea
[4:25:47] <%InvisiblessedReptile> I used to think Litchi from BB was high IQ because of all the stick setups and stances, but I have to revisit her with newfound knowledge
[4:25:48] <+call_me_comic> @GenericSoda you son of a bitch
[4:25:54] <GenericSoda> @call_me_comic nice to see you too

[4:31:30] <+kungfooey242> pot being good against a zoner for once kizzie2Streammonster
[4:31:31] <Afrosamasenpai> Nope!
[4:31:32] <jl_arts> a gun vs a tank
[4:31:33] <ElPlasa> Slidehead alone is a 8-2 matchup
[4:31:39] <krimsoncityogre> I felt that when fighting pot. Not enough bullets.
[4:31:41] <%Demoli_PT> you cant flick
[4:31:43] <%Irridium> the clone does nothing against his  ground attack
[4:31:43] <fangovafang> Most likely
[4:31:48] <%Octopimp> if he tries to shoot you, you get a free knockdown with slidehead
[4:31:48] <GenericSoda> oh yeah, Slide Head seems strong against Chaos
[4:31:49] <krimsoncityogre> Bullets don't work, John.
[4:31:51] <+fizzguy47> He needs an Uzi
[4:32:01] <%Demoli_PT> ggs reggie

[4:32:29] <GenericSoda> Ram monkaS
[4:32:33] <primaryfire> forgot she was in this game lmao
[4:32:45] <FaxineiroDePosto> hello corner my old friend
[4:32:50] <%InvisiblessedReptile> I think RAM crushes the matchup
[4:32:59] <+fizzguy47> I heard "Show me yiur feet"
[4:33:09] <leomuratore> Probably
[4:33:09] <emptyantics> Just shoot her Kappa
[4:33:09] <ElPlasa> is it possible to roll under the explotion?
[4:33:13] <Treasure_Vault> ...does HC have "good" matchups?
[4:33:20] <+Das_Prints> I think it’s more like “show me what you are about”
[4:33:27] <emptyantics> @treasure_vault only his mirrors
[4:33:37] <krimsoncityogre> @Das_Prints Kinda funny with Hap vs Hap.
[4:33:41] <GenericSoda> yeah Chaos seems to speak in literary and writing terms, like motif, theme, script, etc
[4:33:50] <Aussie_Manny> Ramlethal! 2020Forward Ramlethal! 2020Forward Ramlethal! 2020Forward

[4:34:15] <+invalid_robin> Huge
[4:34:26] <KennyKravitz> he mostly does it when hes got the wall
[4:34:34] <+invalid_robin> 5k 2d 214S goes into 300 damage sometimes
[4:34:35] <zenith0111> Consistently 50-60%
[4:34:45] <+Das_Prints> @krimsoncityogre A few of those matches I’ve seen had both sides just trying to outshoot each other from opposite ends. It was pretty funny.
[4:34:49] <GenericSoda> the high five is so good
[4:34:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Weave gunshots into blockstrings
[4:34:55] <Aussie_Manny> fucking high fiving each other LUL
[4:35:05] <GenericSoda> I seriously hope that the high five implies we'll get more unique pre-match intros in the future
[4:35:08] <+paris750000> that high five was awesome
[4:35:12] <%townzzzzz> BANG
[4:35:13] <+fizzguy47> is Gobou on PC or PS
[4:35:14] <%InvisiblessedReptile> Ram has good range to keep him from setting up the meters, can rushdown enough
[4:35:23] <357Sneak> lytSHADES FBBlock KAPOW PrideHeartR robromCOOL
[4:35:27] <Aussie_Manny> Pot VS Pot should be a mega fisto-bump before the fight
[4:35:34] <GunneryGoblin> one of the biggest things to remember with HC that ive learned is not to unload every time you shoot the gun
[4:35:52] <BackflipCharm> Is rolling to the other side valid when getting rushed?
[4:36:06] <%InvisiblessedReptile> @GunneryGoblin That's what Reggie is trying to do, I guess, trying to maintain this meter usage and keep the thing going
[4:36:15] <SuperFightinRobot> How is Happy Chaos mirrors the game going?
[4:36:21] <+Das_Prints> The channel Growtube TV has a bunch of good HC replays from high level players. The one with Kizzie Kay was pretty good.
[4:36:21] <+fizzguy47> he looks more like a prisoner
[4:36:22] <%Octopimp> which sage mode form is this
[4:36:25] <Aussie_Manny> Woolie be seein' Bort's Dad everywhere
[4:36:33] <+fizzguy47> with guns
[4:36:36] <%jinking79> they did that already Woolie
[4:36:48] <GenericSoda> @BackflipCharm sometimes. it can low profile but gets low crushed
[4:36:49] <%InvisiblessedReptile> HC is the Naruto filler episode nobody watched, but it was super cool
[4:36:52] <%Deasmeister> @backflipcharm considering no iframes kinda ehh
[4:36:53] <Dante_Namikaze1> it would the snake sage mode

[4:52:21] <+Cybercobra2> god damn, if you manage to actually lock people down with this guy you fucking deserve it

[4:54:46] <%andrewofbob> Sin has a game of don't empty your gauge, but don't max it either
[4:55:04] <VladVandal> what does the orb lob do? is it just a damage projectile?
[4:55:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1468148034802532354?t=ufv885ONB9gNiHU8rEm7rw&s=19
[4:55:19] <bosssbatttle> @VladVandal makes your retical focus quicker
[4:55:26] <VladVandal> dang yo
[4:55:30] <cheapdoc> He's so quick cancelling the power shot
[4:55:37] <+Cybercobra2> god damn, sickest zoning ever?
[4:55:43] <Purple_Shirt> I feel like the real reason Reggie loves Happy Chaos is toes
[4:55:57] <+fizzguy47> that picked up OTG, wtf
[4:55:58] <+S7R4W83RRY> Guts=1 Damage 1.04
[4:56:00] <%Irridium> I'd imagine lwer than most
[4:56:01] <cheapdoc> He's more or less normal, haven't noticed too much guts on him
[4:56:08] <%Demoli_PT> low guts averag health
[4:56:33] <VladVandal> the....toesies?
[4:56:47] <SofterCrash> same guts value as Axl
[4:57:28] <%jinking79> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[4:57:36] <cheapdoc> A lot of people try to get two shots instead of one with the power shot
[4:57:42] <+Cybercobra2> this is just dope to look at
[4:57:55] <+Cybercobra2> i never thought id love to watch a ranged caracter
[4:58:03] <%jinking79> treat run button like trickster
[4:58:46] <Aussie_Manny> lmao
[4:58:49] <Dante_Namikaze1> I feel that
[4:58:50] <hologram_sam> But the whole aprtment block is gonna smell the game
[4:59:01] <fangovafang> A different taste LUL LUL
[4:59:05] <kidar5> he's fun af
[4:59:07] <Aussie_Manny> SF is simpler. Anime fighters are wild.
[4:59:10] <cheapdoc> Single shell shotgun
[4:59:10] <emptyantics> My boy eatin CupNoodle and Happy Chaos is Ratatouille
[4:59:52] <cheapdoc> I'd say Jack-o is less punishing even
[4:59:57] <SofterCrash> Respect to Chaos mains who commit the head space to all that nonesense
[5:00:04] <cheapdoc> ITS NOT A BIG DEEAL
[5:00:11] <fangovafang> Think da ranger might be da same on DNF?
[5:00:23] <cheapdoc> I doubt ranger will be the same
[5:00:26] <emptyantics> Did you guys see GOLDICK is the least played character next to Jack-O?
[5:00:41] <cheapdoc> Ranger's gameplay looked mad fast, and he was shooting a lot
[5:00:49] <Heefnoff> Reggie also playing Happy Chaos? Love to see it, we always have the same main it seems lol
[5:00:53] <Josef_Stryker> Is Goldlewis still bottom tier?
[5:01:05] <cheapdoc> There is another way to reload, you can deus ex machina
[5:01:06] <fangovafang> @cheapdoc Probably like noel?
[5:01:09] <cheapdoc> but it takes meter
[5:01:11] <357Sneak> lytJACKPOT
[5:01:15] <%Deasmeister> deus ex reloads
[5:01:17] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus  deus ex super reloads all bullets

[5:10:08] <+saltpiggu> it needs it
[5:10:22] <Aussie_Manny> Rollback, or no buy.
[5:10:26] <Sonny_Firestorm> For Ultimax, Atlus left Arksys to do most of the writing. Needless to say it was a shitshow, unlike the first Arena.
[5:10:27] <+polothegreatest> 3k%
[5:10:44] <+saltpiggu> they can do it, its literally whether Atlus lets them
[5:10:44] <GenericSoda> I've already left a comment on both announcement tweets, on the announcement video, and RT'd the initial tweet with a request for people to push for rollback, I'm doing my part
[5:10:45] <SofterCrash> I condone this message
