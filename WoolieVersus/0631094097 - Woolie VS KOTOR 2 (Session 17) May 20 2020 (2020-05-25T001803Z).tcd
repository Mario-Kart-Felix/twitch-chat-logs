[0:02:12] <%Chatterbox1991> @woolieversus never forget the original Doctor Who
[0:02:23] <+wunp_fxs> music labels are the fucknig worst
[0:02:30] <lutefiiisk> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:02:32] <%afronooch> Net sucks and rules simultaneously
[0:02:33] <dmmm123> there are so many lost Doctor Who episodes, it is ridiculous
[0:02:33] <+VCRUZZO> everyone of them
[0:02:43] <cochramd1992> lawsuit?
[0:02:46] <%RioGascar> so the music industry is just like the video game, and movie industry? Where preservation is so little concern until we had old 1930’s movies entirely gone and some games disappear into the void
[0:02:52] <%Chatterbox1991> Doctor who is reaching Bafmodad level rareity
[0:02:52] <socratetris> music industry is the most corrupt of all legal industry
[0:02:54] <cochramd1992> just popped in, what they talking about?
[0:02:57] <+xerotwo> $$$$$$$$
[0:03:01] <GHouseduivel> UMG is too rich, to not get away with it
[0:03:02] <%LordSDB> What happened?
[0:03:10] <+xerotwo> ALL ABOUT THE $$$$$$$$$$
[0:03:11] <huskarl_zap> Every single genre is "MTV made up a sub genre because we didn't sign."
[0:03:12] <%RioGascar> the only industry that has preservation IS BOOKS
[0:03:13] <grandark_z317> Shido coverup in real time.
[0:03:15] <%Gruhunchously> Doctor Who, Adam Adamant, and tons of other BBC shows from the 60s are lost forever because of bad archiving
[0:03:24] <dmmm123> music burned in a fire
[0:03:24] <%RioGascar> LIBRARIES TRY AND PRESERVE BOOKS

[0:04:26] <+xerotwo> F U C K U M G

[0:08:08] <cochramd1992> Holy shit
[0:08:08] <grandark_z317> If Disney Star Wars hasn't fucking died yet, what makes you think UMG's going to bite it anytime soon?
[0:08:22] <dmmm123> YouTube's bot is probably still gonna auto-copyright that music, though
[0:08:23] <cochramd1992> @grandark_z317 soon...
[0:08:35] <+xerotwo> U M G S U C K S

[0:09:08] <skeith77> Y E E T
[0:09:13] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Maybe you can run around talking to people and maybe scrounge up some light side points
[0:09:17] <huskarl_zap> Gun bang

[0:09:44] <grandark_z317> Darth UMG the Retarded.
[0:09:45] <%Irridium> it's like Bethesda saying they started the FPS genre just because they bought Id
[0:09:59] <dmmm123> When we last left our "heroes"...
[0:10:07] <+BlockingDisabled> "I didn't think so, it is the kind of story they would never tell you..."
[0:10:24] <%Chatterbox1991> Leave it to UMG to somehow Rook Vrook
[0:10:27] <Ashenik1> not from the artists
[0:10:44] <%AuriosVS> yo whats up guys

[0:12:13] <dmmm123> UNLIMITED COMMANDS
[0:12:14] <%Gruhunchously> Atris' excuse is that she's going fucking insane
[0:12:23] <+evbites> i'm old and wrong the worst of both worlds
[0:12:30] <terramagus> Oh, this is part 2 of the stream?
[0:12:47] <%ChoculaUltra> yus
[0:12:52] <terramagus> Battle Tendency, go tit
[0:13:19] <Redblood801> Hoe's mad 2: Vrook Boogaloo
[0:13:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Being good is not the same as being weak and toothless.
[0:14:10] <shincadad> Oh yeah the best spell in the game
[0:14:30] <Redblood801> Hey V, are we going to try and get THAT upgrade for HK?
[0:14:31] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:14:53] <Ashenik1> I mean even Jesus sai to his followers : Dont atack nobody but take these swords casue thats a denagreous neighberbhoud
[0:14:59] <subjectg> I think they need one more planet for THAT upgrade
[0:15:27] <shincadad> Jesus T3
[0:15:28] <skeith77> MNB .
[0:15:42] <terramagus> I forget if the TSLCRM changes the dialogue on Korriban. I might be confusing that with a different mod.
[0:15:54] <lotharrio> Dual Wielding is good for gun-boys.
[0:16:25] <%ShadowArcangel> I think its a different mod youre talking about, cause I remember installing a mod like that
[0:16:31] <subjectg> So if you thought one disintegrator was awesome, think of TWO disintegrators
[0:16:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big tiddy sith gf uwu
[0:16:58] <Bassman_PhD> give visas a second lightsaber!!
[0:17:09] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Talk to the droid at the landing pad, it has something to show you.
[0:17:13] <%ShadowArcangel> A lot of Visas interjections was in Onderon unfortunately
[0:17:26] <Redblood801> @subjectg This droid found the secret of dual disintegrators. The Republic HATES HIM!
[0:17:41] <Bassman_PhD> give her a second lightsaber!
[0:17:49] <terramagus> Yeah I remember female having way better dialogue on Korriban, and there being a mod to make it gender agnostic.
[0:18:16] <%Gruhunchously> You interactions with Sion get...interesting if you play a female PC
[0:18:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> red lol
[0:18:36] <lotharrio> Need to craft more parts, it seems.
[0:18:37] <%ShadowArcangel> That mod is different from the one I was thinking but yes, it is freaking awesome
[0:18:55] <khotgor> Sion is a weird character outside of KOTOR2
[0:19:12] <Bassman_PhD> well she is our big tiddy goth shorty
[0:19:17] <%Gruhunchously> Outside of KOTOR 2?
[0:19:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[0:19:54] <khotgor> The fact that Sion has a cult dedicated to him on Plo Koon's home planet is weird
[0:19:58] <lotharrio> There's a Pontite Lens that does a lot of extra damage.
[0:20:23] <lotharrio> I think it's Pontite.
[0:20:27] <Redblood801> It's the D&D Shopping episode!
[0:20:45] <%Gruhunchously> Guys, we're spending minutes on end to make sure that enemies go down in 3 seconds as opposed to 4.
[0:21:07] <lotharrio> Yeah but it's fun.
[0:21:07] <khotgor> Force Lightning kinda makes every encounter meaningless
[0:21:28] <lotharrio> No Stealth, either.
[0:21:29] <aeravon> he's having fun. its fine
[0:21:34] <%Gruhunchously> You know that T3 is a workbench himself?
[0:21:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:21:36] <grandark_z317> @gruhunchously that's an extra second to check the corpses.
[0:21:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 37! wew lad
[0:22:16] <Redblood801> T3 teleports behind you
[0:22:22] <terramagus> Kind of wish KotOR had the ability to chunk corpses like in Baldur's Gate. Like, if you do twice their HP in one hit, they straight up disintegrate like in A New Hope
[0:23:01] <%Gruhunchously> Or how critical hits in Fallout just blow people's limbs off or disintigrate them
[0:23:26] <lotharrio> A deflection emitter is pretty good in the off hand.
[0:24:27] <DSD24> I love Purple
[0:24:38] <%Gruhunchously> You've heard of a Grey Paladin? How about a GRAPE Paladin.
[0:24:42] <lotharrio> So Mace Windu is a former Sith. That' why he's all, "A Sith LORD?"
[0:25:23] <$Invlux> "fuck me!" Kreygasm
[0:25:24] <terramagus> "Do you need me to stab myself in the heart right now? Because I have the knife out my lord"
[0:25:25] <+evbites> visas:you own me
[0:25:25] <+ntfth> In the old EU Leia's daughter also used a purple lightsaber.
[0:25:30] <ChinMusicTwo> fuck off the edge of my dick
[0:25:33] <DSD24> Visas just needs a hug
[0:25:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[0:25:42] <%Gruhunchously> A big hug. And some therapy
[0:25:44] <Redblood801> My LiFE iS YoURs!
[0:25:46] <lotharrio> Visas is into Force choke-play.
[0:25:48] <grandark_z317> Roxas
[0:25:56] <grandark_z317> NotLikeThis
[0:26:03] <%Irridium> run right past those remains
[0:26:16] <terramagus> He died for nothing.
[0:26:27] <terramagus> Don't even validate his existence by looting the body.
[0:26:36] <Redblood801> Show chat
[0:26:39] <%ChoculaUltra> am I bad for actually liking Kylo Ren's jank saber
[0:26:56] <DSD24> @ChoculaUltra No you are not, its a cool design
[0:26:59] <Dangerzone979> Kylo Ren's saber is the only good thing about him
[0:27:08] <MasterDecoder> @ChoculaUltra I do too
[0:27:09] <DSD24> Cross Guard is pretty rad
[0:27:09] <Redblood801> @ChoculaUltra No, because it's rad
[0:27:12] <lotharrio> "We can only afford her for so many lines."
[0:27:26] <+prime_name> Planet racism cured
[0:27:28] <lotharrio> "Oh right, Jedi are good at murder. Cool!"
[0:27:41] <DSD24> At least Kylo Ren's lightsaber is unique
[0:27:54] <+HollowMan190> we did it we cured racism
[0:28:00] <terramagus> So I missed part 1 and never played KotOR2 male: does Disciple even show up if you're male?
[0:28:04] <%Gruhunchously> All you have to do is kill like two dozen people
[0:28:08] <terramagus> GHOSTS
[0:28:09] <%ShadowArcangel> GHOST
[0:28:09] <Safarihat> Remains!!!
[0:28:10] <Redblood801> He does
[0:28:11] <%Gruhunchously> Whoosh
[0:28:17] <+UberWolfman> FORCE GHOSTS
[0:28:19] <Bassman_PhD> merchant subquest thingy
[0:28:20] <usurper_sos> Don't worry about that
[0:28:22] <%Gruhunchously> Echoes of battlefields of old
[0:28:26] <$Invlux> Friendship ended with Racism
[0:28:29] <+evbites> blood for blood the jedi way
[0:28:30] <%wildcard_9000> TPose
[0:28:36] <usurper_sos> Just a disturbance in the force
[0:28:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:28:38] <Hopit> Talk to the Sullustan?
[0:28:41] <Safarihat> DONT MISS REMAINS
[0:28:52] <Redblood801> I guess we're off to a new planet. I wonder which one it could be. Kappa
[0:28:58] <%Gruhunchously> Annoying recitation
[0:28:59] <terramagus> Good ol' Yavin 4
[0:29:15] <terramagus> Wait, does the Steam version even have Yavin
[0:29:19] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Talk to the protocol droid
[0:29:22] <%ShadowArcangel> didn't Fanny get a new force form as well? did they check that?
[0:29:24] <Redblood801> We're going to Tython bois WHOOOO!
[0:29:41] <%Chatterbox1991> Yes woolie
[0:29:49] <%Irridium> there were some in the building you ran past
[0:30:14] <%ShadowArcangel> inside
[0:30:18] <%Chatterbox1991> there was a body inside
[0:30:49] <Safarihat> Body inside
[0:30:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> there were bodies inside the compound
[0:30:56] <shincadad> (Nothing)
[0:30:59] <$Invlux> >:T
[0:31:07] <LunarRemix> Universe (Nothing)
[0:31:38] <lotharrio> Improved Automaton Gloves are pretty good.
[0:31:38] <Ashenik1> SUPER WRONG
[0:31:43] <khotgor> Woolie needed some Life Support anyways
[0:31:45] <terramagus> Shouldn't have even validated his existence. If you don't loot a body, it's like they were never born.
[0:31:51] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Might be good for crafting
[0:31:54] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus The universe says to talk to the protocol droid at the landing pad.
[0:32:07] <%ShadowArcangel> oh yeah, that droid
[0:32:30] <%Irridium> ok boomer
[0:32:39] <Ashenik1> HK !!!!!!
[0:32:49] <%ChoculaUltra> is that the Pazaak Lord
[0:32:53] <%ChoculaUltra> Pato Ado?!
[0:32:55] <%Irridium> the thrill of battle
[0:33:00] <+evbites> moral victory
[0:33:02] <%Irridium> that's what's left
[0:33:07] <%ChoculaUltra> Show me a good time, Fanny!
[0:33:17] <Redblood801> It's the evil!
[0:33:30] <%gatorafan> Thar war was NOTHING compare to the Pazaak battle you had
[0:33:35] <eldragon_1> For Fun!
[0:34:02] <DSD24> Lure you into a false sense of security
[0:34:09] <Redblood801> Stand, save your cards
[0:34:49] <%Gruhunchously> Gamblers fallacy
[0:34:58] <khotgor> If Woolie played New Vegas, he would dive deep into Caravan
[0:35:00] <dead_harmony13> Internet so shit I can't read the numbers
[0:35:16] <terramagus> I played New Vegas for 500 hours and I don't think I ever played Caravan
[0:35:18] <%Irridium> if he could understand caravan. I sure as shit couldn't
[0:35:21] <lotharrio> Try to push to fill.
[0:35:24] <GHouseduivel> Holy shit
[0:35:27] <prince_johnny_> EZ
[0:35:41] <DSD24> I never played Caravan as well

[0:35:48] <+griffball13> GG EZ
[0:35:48] <khotgor> Caravan is pretty easy to understand. Just never use Queens and Jokers, stick to Kings and Jacks
[0:35:50] <%Gruhunchously> Step on ,me
[0:35:58] <GHouseduivel> @DSD24 Caravan isn't as tough once you get the concept
[0:35:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dwooo
[0:36:09] <lotharrio> The ancient Sith card player that was in your armor parts, has been defeated. You got nothing for me, Ithorian.
[0:36:13] <+griffball13> FOR MANDALOR
[0:36:18] <terramagus> Pray Return to the Dxun Jungle
[0:36:24] <Redblood801> FOR MANDALORE!
[0:36:27] <DSD24> @GHouseduivel Next time I replay NV I'll give it a shot
[0:36:59] <GHouseduivel> @DSD24 You'll need to wiki dive to fully get how and why
[0:37:00] <lotharrio> Killing Jedi
[0:37:27] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> MANY PogChamp
[0:37:34] <%Gruhunchously> This conversation is going to be cathartci
[0:37:37] <Quiet__Viking> this is the best Hk convo in the game
[0:37:42] <+griffball13> RIGHT
[0:37:50] <prince_johnny_> i luv this convo
[0:37:54] <khotgor> Eh. The document given by the Gas Station guy in Goodsprings gives a good detail of how it works
[0:38:07] <DSD24> What a Silly Billy
[0:38:34] <Redblood801> Write that down chat, write that down!
[0:38:37] <+evbites> first the gas hen the stabs
[0:38:47] <usurper_sos> Will this be on the test?
[0:38:57] <Redblood801> Yes
[0:38:58] <+ItsRatman> Muhlay
[0:38:58] <lotharrio> Ma-lay shields.
[0:39:05] <+evbites> and this one
[0:39:13] <DisGuyOvahEre> i am the hoe and i am mad whats up chat
[0:39:13] <Redblood801> It's pronounced Me-Lee
[0:39:30] <$Invlux> hit em with a slug-thrower
[0:39:49] <Ashenik1> expensive???
[0:39:49] <%Gruhunchously> There's no time
[0:39:59] <%ShadowArcangel> the technology was only in the old republic I think is the explanation...as stupid as that is
[0:40:07] <Daxalog> probably very expensive to buy and maintain.
[0:40:28] <lotharrio> Oh right, G0-T0 probably has cash for you.
[0:40:39] <Daxalog> why dosnt everyone just wear stylized kevlar. (this would be kinda cool?)
[0:40:50] <%ShadowArcangel> Kill the children!
[0:40:55] <+griffball13> what losers
[0:40:55] <terramagus> Especially the children
[0:40:59] <%Gruhunchously> That's what Atton said
[0:40:59] <+MidnightBurst12> shoot the child first
[0:41:23] <%Gruhunchously> Shoot the child
[0:41:25] <Redblood801> A jeDI's LiFE iS sAcrIfIcE!
[0:41:26] <+Mondeiya> also ig not everyone expects to fight a jedi on a regular basis
[0:41:35] <ChinMusicTwo> Rules of Engagement what is that?
[0:41:49] <+griffball13> so crime of passion got it
[0:41:52] <terramagus> "It seems they don't save their game often"
[0:41:58] <$Invlux> EXP BONUS?
[0:42:00] <+evbites> I CAN SEE THE FUTURE
[0:42:01] <%ShadowArcangel> Crimes of passion are super effective
[0:42:13] <lotharrio> "Set up big traps, but also be spontaneous."
[0:42:19] <DisGuyOvahEre> in the star wars role playing game its a feat called "bad feeling"
[0:42:22] <Quiet__Viking> that's why order 66 happened not even the clones knew about it
[0:42:26] <DSD24> Don't start with a gun
[0:42:32] <DSD24> But then use one later
[0:42:32] <DisGuyOvahEre> it allows you to have a bad feeling about pre meditated actions
[0:42:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[0:42:50] <DSD24> A sand kiver sounds rad
[0:43:01] <%bread_assassin> Did we get "the line" from HK yet?
[0:43:06] <%krispen_wa> I just got here. Did Woolie get pissed at Vrook's general existence?
[0:43:09] <terramagus> I think it's like 3 dialogue choices away
[0:43:11] <%Gruhunchously> Orbital bombardment
[0:43:13] <$Invlux> Kappa
[0:43:15] <lotharrio> @krispen_wa Yes
[0:43:18] <Ravingpyro> lol meatbag
[0:43:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @krispen_wa He almost threw his controller XD
[0:43:40] <lotharrio> Echani techniques work for that, too.
[0:43:53] <$Invlux> oh bruh is he gonna get more bonuses
[0:43:53] <christopherwpoindexter> OMFG YES I FINALLY JOINED LIVE!!!! I'm only a few hours behind (early Dantooine post-Pazaak) Hello everyone, I been watching and loving this series like crazy, so glad to be here in the live, ongoing moment.
[0:43:55] <usurper_sos> He's hiding his mind inside of the ship
[0:44:03] <grimwire1> atton and hk would be bros in killing jedis
[0:44:13] <+prime_name> Chaos realm magic nonesense
[0:44:17] <terramagus> Atton and HK would hate each other, despite their similarities
[0:44:18] <$Invlux> @christopherwpoindexter howdy
[0:44:23] <+griffball13> just be smart
[0:44:28] <Ashenik1> like witchers ???
[0:44:33] <lotharrio> I know the techs. My footsies are unbeatable.
[0:44:36] <%Gruhunchously> Atton regrets what he did, while HK revels in it
[0:44:48] <christopherwpoindexter> @invlux 🙂👍🏻
[0:45:29] <%krispen_wa> KOTOR is an era where there were so many fucking jedi that people NEEDED to learn how to hardcounter them through mind shit
[0:45:41] <Redblood801> HK is rock hard talking about killing Jedi
[0:46:02] <terramagus> "Master, it appears I am at full-durasteel while going down this line of thought"
[0:46:13] <christopherwpoindexter> @redblood801 his...behavior core is rock hard, he might say
[0:46:23] <DisGuyOvahEre> the same works in the reverse, when jedi go into exile they either go to a planet with immense numbers of lifeforms where they can turn living animals as a security net or a dead planet devoid of force to blend in and spread their presence over a large surface
[0:46:24] <lotharrio> So presumably this is also why Handmaiden was the last of her sisters. She was crippling herself to try and follow the "Force-dulling" techniques her sisters use.
[0:46:27] <+evbites> order 66
[0:46:30] <WanderingBard> Favorite line
[0:46:32] <JetpackMcQuack> “The master” Kappa
[0:46:34] <+firmlygraspi1> and a real hero
[0:46:37] <DisGuyOvahEre> its not force dulling, its force stealth
[0:46:53] <Redblood801> The weakness of a Jedi is regular fucking people
[0:46:54] <DisGuyOvahEre> you cannot create or destroy the force, just manipulate it
[0:46:54] <e3a4> A real Human Bean
[0:46:55] <grandark_z317> And then Disney shat all over this.
[0:47:06] <Ashenik1> Avelone was really pasionate about making sense of the Star Wars universe
[0:47:09] <%ChoculaUltra> Disney took this outback and shot it twice.
[0:47:11] <khotgor> Disney shits over itself all the time
[0:47:18] <DisGuyOvahEre> avelone didn't invent this
[0:47:30] <terramagus> But he sharpened it
[0:47:31] <%krispen_wa> Avellone invented Star Wars
[0:47:35] <DisGuyOvahEre> this was pre established.
[0:47:45] <DisGuyOvahEre> exar kun came before these games were made
[0:47:45] <%Irridium> In Disney's defense Bioware shit all over this with SWTOR long before Disney Wars was a thing
[0:47:52] <%krispen_wa> exar-senpai*
[0:47:53] <%Gruhunchously> Avelonne did a lot of reading of Star Wars EU material in preparation for writing this game
[0:48:02] <%Gruhunchously> *Avellone
[0:48:04] <Ashenik1> Avelone made it work in games
[0:48:22] <grandark_z317> No, Anakin is ruined now and forever.
[0:48:27] <GHouseduivel> Vader telling dad jokes is my favorite
[0:48:36] <Ashenik1> Avelone found the most intersting ideas about SW and made a game about it :p
[0:48:39] <khotgor> The best Darth Vader is Robot Chicken Vader
[0:48:43] <Redblood801> Luke is a solid hero
[0:48:48] <grandark_z317> A solid hero
[0:49:04] <grandark_z317> that tried to murder his nephew after fleeing from his family.
[0:49:08] <%krispen_wa> Remember when Darth Vader was crying when Luke had some sand on his robes from Tatooine
[0:49:15] <%phatmac16> it's not bad to have a straightforward hero
[0:49:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> meh
[0:49:27] <Ashenik1> me too
[0:49:33] <%Gruhunchously> Fanfiction writes have made Rey 10x more interesting
[0:49:34] <khotgor> Darth Vader has PTSD when he looks at a grain of sand
[0:49:34] <%phatmac16> Rei was okay in the first movie
[0:49:36] <DSD24> I liked Finn
[0:49:37] <+evbites> she super perfect
[0:49:38] <DisGuyOvahEre> luke was already a character that didn't need EU expansion
[0:49:41] <%Chatterbox1991> as a writer I think I could do something to do with Rey
[0:49:42] <Tucker0603> Luke in EU has a lot of cool shit
[0:49:48] <terramagus> I mean, sand would clog his breathing machines. I'd stay away from it too.
[0:49:48] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:49:49] <Ashenik1> like GOT ;<
[0:49:55] <GHouseduivel> I think they Rey would've been better if she stayed DS
[0:49:56] <DisGuyOvahEre> if you make a film and it needs things out side of the film to explain it your film is crap
[0:49:56] <%krispen_wa> What even is Rey's character?
[0:49:58] <%phatmac16> any competent writer could do something Rey
[0:50:02] <%Chatterbox1991> @ashenik1 *hug*
[0:50:06] <%ShadowArcangel> there's more
[0:50:08] <christopherwpoindexter> I like the actors and actresses of the sequel trilogy, they deserved such better characters
[0:50:19] <%ShadowArcangel> 1
[0:50:19] <grandark_z317> @chatterbox1991 whatever you could do is better than what Disney did.
[0:50:19] <DisGuyOvahEre> @phatmac16 they did because rey is just jaina solo but OP
[0:50:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @krispen_wa Its being default female rpg model 2
[0:50:25] <Ashenik1> @Chatterbox1991 :3
[0:50:28] <%phatmac16> yeah, the actors were good, they just had a bad script
[0:50:29] <terramagus> Nah, you can get it even if you don't have Handmaiden.
[0:50:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> The squeals are a lesson in why you should PLAN your movies out in advance.
[0:50:42] <lotharrio> Might be after a story event?
[0:50:42] <Redblood801> Play it for us
[0:50:55] <christopherwpoindexter> YES THIS IS A CLASSIC

[0:51:47] <DisGuyOvahEre> HK the match maker

[0:51:49] <%ondri21> its the hoes mad bois, wats good @WoolieVersus
[0:51:54] <%psidefx> That's pretty good
[0:51:59] <%phatmac16> that's the best way to describe love
[0:52:03] <Tucker0603> man HK is great
[0:52:08] <%krispen_wa> lmao look at this Order 66 foreshadowing
[0:52:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hmm
[0:52:16] <terramagus> It does totally make sense. Having that rifle, and making a non-fatal shot?
[0:52:18] <DSD24> Oh god more mind breaks
[0:52:19] <+griffball13> i must break you
[0:52:20] <Bassman_PhD> but what about the hk package?
[0:52:22] <%krispen_wa> this came out before RotS right?
[0:52:23] <CastellanVon> This came out before Revenge of the Sith
[0:52:27] <christopherwpoindexter> @krispen_wa literally just thought that
[0:52:30] <%ShadowArcangel> yep before
[0:52:34] <Tucker0603> fuck those stupid spinny shit
[0:52:41] <%JustYudha> And then you can fly with it
[0:52:46] <%alrobot2014> about a year before revenge of the sith i think
[0:52:49] <%JustYudha> Because physics
[0:52:55] <Bassman_PhD> we haven't done the hk package yet right
[0:53:00] <%JustYudha> I mean the foooorcee
[0:53:02] <%ChoculaUltra> HK says "religion" with such a unique tang of vitriol. I love it.
[0:53:08] <%krispen_wa> you have to complete all the planets to do hk package
[0:53:11] <+evbites> unless you have a dual bladed lightsaber then you good just block at the last second ad watch them fly
[0:53:18] <hologram_sam> my weekly dose of s&m droid
[0:53:29] <Redblood801> What about Twi'leks?
[0:53:35] <Ids560> get fucked aliens
[0:53:50] <%Gruhunchously> "You're a wonderful human being"
[0:53:50] <christopherwpoindexter> directly **quoting** Revan...interesting
[0:53:51] <Redblood801> I love it
[0:54:17] <%ChoculaUltra> oh god, is KOTOR2 Revan Chris Avellone's self-insert?
[0:54:23] <lotharrio> HK and G0-T0 talking around their poor understanding of space magic is fun.
[0:54:24] <%krispen_wa> Kreia is Chris Avellone's self-insert, but Revan is his mary sue version of himself
[0:54:30] <%ChoculaUltra> ah kk
[0:54:30] <christopherwpoindexter> a DROID navigating the Force
[0:54:32] <terramagus> Yeah it's absolutely Kreia.
[0:54:36] <%phatmac16> isn't Kreia his self-insert?
[0:54:50] <christopherwpoindexter> *DROID trying to understand the Force
[0:54:55] <baron_b0nes> Bruh
[0:55:21] <DSD24> Press X to Doubt
[0:55:23] <StarlitStunner> Chris is a good writer, but his takes on the legion’s morality in New Vegas are wildly strange
[0:55:36] <terramagus> The Legion has a lot of cut content though
[0:55:37] <%krispen_wa> Rapes all the women...but the ROADS THO
[0:55:45] <DSD24> Legion is a bunch of psychos
[0:56:03] <%Gruhunchously> I still don't understand where this idea of 'Chris thinks the Legion is so rad, guys' came from.
[0:56:04] <DisGuyOvahEre> its clear what happened
[0:56:07] <+ItsRatman> Roads are safe, so I guess I can give Legion a pass
[0:56:08] <khotgor> The greatest and worst thing about Obsidian is their desire to reach the stars, whilst lacking a grasp of limitations and their footing
[0:56:09] <DisGuyOvahEre> planet blew up
[0:56:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Droid trying to understand the Force is like a dog trying to understand colour. Really glad they explored this
[0:56:17] <lotharrio> Yeah the Legion suffered from New Vegas having only 14 months or whatever to be made. They dropped all the stuff that was supposed to make them viable as an option.
[0:56:25] <StarlitStunner> @terramagus I know, I read the Van Burren design docs. They were still weirdos in kilts
[0:56:32] <DSD24> I know Cass says "Hey they at least protect the caravans well" but that doesn't escuse the raping and pillaging
[0:56:47] <%phatmac16> war never changes
[0:56:49] <terramagus> The Legion had like, 90% of their content cut. THe only thing they had left was the mainline, and the slave pits. Ulysses was supposed to bei n the base game.
[0:56:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:56:54] <%krispen_wa> i think legion could have been interesting if they didn't TRIPLE DOWN on how evil they were
[0:57:02] <+evbites> yeah the sexism really just put them on raider level
[0:57:09] <DisGuyOvahEre> the reason the jedi call themselves peacekeeps in the prequels is because they know war will change their pure views on the world
[0:57:09] <+shapeforn> AFAIK in the game, the only people that project that they thinkk the Legion is rad are IN the Legion
[0:57:15] <%ChoculaUltra> I wish more games had Ron Perlman just reading stuff out loud.
[0:57:18] <+Mondeiya> yeah, legion was super cut into comically evil.. like obviously they are terrible regardless, but pretty sure they intended to add at least a pinch of grayness to the characters in the legion
[0:57:29] <DSD24> Don't forget the no tech usage
[0:57:43] <%krispen_wa> except if you're Caesar, where you get all the good medicine
[0:57:46] <%therabbles> legion was probably meant to be something similar to what klingons were in star trek
[0:57:50] <terramagus> Yeah there are only 2 characters in New Vegas that are okay with the Legion. That one caravan master at the SW part of the map, and Raul
[0:57:57] <DisGuyOvahEre> well thats bullshit because the clone wars were not that long
[0:58:02] <DisGuyOvahEre> fuck 3d clone wars
[0:58:10] <%Chatterbox1991> Nadarr?
[0:58:20] <DSD24> The Exile has stacks
[0:58:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @lotharrio Kinda ironic that both KOTOR 2 and NV had very little development time because of publishers wanting a quick buck from a hot franchise and they both managed to move heaven and earth and deliver a masterpiece
[0:58:36] <%krispen_wa> Man HK-47 is just REVEALING the plot here
[0:58:50] <%Gruhunchously> And just like that HK gives away the major plot twist
[0:59:03] <+Mondeiya> v:tm also had little dev time right?
[0:59:07] <christopherwpoindexter> @ballerswagbro9k and be considered by many as better than later entries
[0:59:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup
[0:59:22] <terramagus> V:TM was the first Source game, and Valve would not help them to make HL2 look better by comparison
[0:59:24] <DSD24> @Mondeiya Yes it did it had to come out before Half Life
[0:59:25] <%Gruhunchously> You know theres' a message log where you can look over conversations right?
[0:59:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> revan remarked on how ironic it was that human emotion is so effective against force users
[0:59:39] <%Gruhunchously> *Almost* done
[0:59:42] <%ShadowArcangel> btw after Korriban there's one extra dialogue with HK
[0:59:48] <Redblood801> Fat Boi

[1:00:55] <%krispen_wa> Ask, and I shall answer
[1:00:58] <christopherwpoindexter> @redblood801 😆 sorry, i was quoting HK
[1:01:06] <terramagus> "Place it back into your inventory and allow me to use it in a function()"

[1:21:38] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> I'm pretty sure the first darksaber user was force sensitive mandalorian
[1:21:42] <+ntfth> @WoolieVersus Speaking of what that means, have you ever heard of the Mandalorian Knights in the old EU? They were a group of Jedi who deserted to join the Mandalorians in the Mandalorian Wars and sought to make a Force sec loyal to them.

[1:23:56] <DSD24> @lotharrio I think he got the skill
[1:24:01] <lotharrio> Does he? Must have slept on that.
[1:24:03] <+lag2993> lol the general literally tried to kill you and you dont know who to back?
[1:24:39] <terramagus> Is there even a dark side option here? I've never seen it, and I tried.

[1:28:10] <$TheFabledAble> WHAT THE FUCK?!
[1:28:23] <%therabbles> Granny wouldn't leave her favorite boy
[1:28:26] <%Gruhunchously> Boy, make up your mind
[1:28:28] <Redblood801> What do you mean?! HK is incredibly subtle
[1:28:31] <notenoughgirls> even with the skill implant?
[1:28:37] <christopherwpoindexter> the second phase of the Heist
[1:28:44] <dorpork> pick mira as leader
[1:28:46] <dorpork> for influence
[1:28:56] <+Freeborg1997> Have you not gotten Mira as a jedi yet?
[1:29:07] <dorpork> i don't think there's anymore opportunities to gain influence with mire and goto
[1:29:14] <$Invlux> ooh
[1:29:18] <%jiggy_snipe> MAN
[1:29:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:29:21] <%phatmac16> BURN
[1:29:24] <%Gruhunchously> No she won't what are you talknig about?
[1:29:27] <terramagus> She'll get influence because she knows you're sending her out there to style on them in the dancer outfit
[1:29:37] <Redblood801> ARE YOU SURE?! ~Granny
[1:29:44] <zocano> and people like Mira
[1:29:45] <DSD24> Jesus guys
[1:29:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> shut up

[1:30:23] <+UberWolfman> Fuckin MAARKS
[1:30:29] <christopherwpoindexter> visa card

[1:30:34] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Whoever said you get influence with whoever you send is wrong
[1:30:38] <+MagicBeanBurrito> 5th time's final
[1:30:39] <huskarl_zap> handmaiden KappaRoss
[1:30:46] <DSD24> Kex Cereal
[1:30:48] <huskarl_zap> Top Kex
[1:30:54] <zocano> No Mira influence btw
[1:30:59] <usurper_sos> Praise the sun
[1:31:06] <Redblood801> All the warriors!
[1:31:06] <christopherwpoindexter> YES
[1:31:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I agree
[1:31:24] <+Freeborg1997> Finally
[1:31:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I am after all a Certified Baller Expert
[1:31:49] <DSD24> This guns is good for robocide
[1:31:51] <terramagus> I'm looking at a guide and there's no influence left for Mira in the entire game
[1:32:03] <notenoughgirls> same with Goto i think
[1:32:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:32:03] <dorpork> whelp
[1:32:10] <khotgor> People have bad taste in liking the Miras
[1:32:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I bet that will devastate Woolie
[1:32:19] <+Freeborg1997> @terramagus Yeah, think they messed up on Dantooine
[1:32:19] <notenoughgirls> use the power of force console command
[1:32:23] <terramagus> All the Mira influence was on the first trip to Onderon. So the only way left is to cheat.
[1:32:36] <terramagus> Power Word: Console is the only solution.
[1:32:52] <+SolidusRex> Bane?
[1:32:54] <%Irridium> well, time for force Tilde
[1:33:25] <christopherwpoindexter> dungeon
[1:33:25] <DSD24> You must gather your party before venturing forth
[1:33:25] <time_axis> sounds like we're doing a nar shadaa thing again
[1:33:26] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> ready to beeline?
[1:33:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[1:33:57] <$Invlux> LUL
[1:34:00] <Redblood801> Just letting you know, there is no console command for influence. You'll need a save editor
[1:34:02] <prince_johnny_> NOOOO
[1:34:09] <+prime_name> It's gonna take the rest of the night
[1:34:09] <prince_johnny_> LUL
[1:34:11] <%ShadowArcangel> good session, basically finished an entire planet and then some
[1:34:13] <terramagus> Save editors are probably safer, honestly
[1:34:17] <+UberWolfman> Fair enough
[1:34:27] <+funnyfunnykid> good work
[1:34:31] <Redblood801> There's a good one on the steam workshop

[1:34:46] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Just so you know, there's no Mira influence here.
[1:34:49] <%crossing_mao> GAME OVER YEAHHHHH

[1:36:47] <%Irridium> he might have Sith
[1:36:52] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia mentions he has a crew
[1:37:02] <%Pillagius> It's not badly rendered space - hungry boy is so strong that he sucks out pixels from his environment
[1:37:04] <Redblood801> Is this the Krusty Krew?
[1:37:18] <CookieDoughFK> the sith assassins from the start
