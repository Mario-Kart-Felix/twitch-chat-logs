[0:26:29] <NarcissistCactus> a lot of food seems good until you're not hungry anymore
[0:26:37] <ALTRNico> gib be meat
[0:26:39] <cochramd1992> yeah, it's easier when there's no bread involved
[0:26:43] <hassanico2> I won $20 in a spicy food eating contest once
[0:26:48] <+ggbhtg> Who's a greenhorn?! What's a greenhorn?!?!

[0:27:20] <@Menitta> Woolie wants that KFC chicken sandwich
[0:27:24] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus the volume of a 30 inch cirlce is more than two 18 inch pizzas
[0:27:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Scale the burger but keep the patty the same size: the tiny hat waifu of burgers
[0:27:28] <+McSoliace> what about lettuce?
[0:27:29] <%masterpiecejeremy> Woolie, go to Belle et La Boeuf and order the Heart Attack. I ate it all in 1 sitting
[0:27:30] <cochramd1992> mmmm

[0:30:12] <Plugman86> I've had a 3 pound tomahawk steak solo
[0:30:16] <cochramd1992> it's more a volume thing
[0:30:17] <Personified134> 10 pounds total present in the stomahc is about the point of rupture
[0:30:17] <austin9568> Take it to the Gulag!

[0:32:57] <cochramd1992> so, NUNS huh
[0:32:59] <@Solidus_113> people who go to eating competitions usually eat a whole cabbage a day beforehand
[0:33:04] <muniea3> they're just anime protagonists
[0:33:14] <+Estuko> I still want to finish a costco pizza by myself, but having a child body doesn't fucking help.

[0:33:41] <%redrins> doodStare
[0:33:43] <+gustavozxd> this is such a bizarre topic
[0:33:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> hunger is triggered partly by whether your stomach is empty. hence why stomach stapling is a thing. makes me wonder if that dude is hungry all the time

[0:37:34] <cochramd1992> what is Farenheit even based on?
[0:37:38] <+kcsnipes> 32 & 212 MAKES SENSE
[0:37:40] <+Estuko> @htt0r1hnz0 ♥
[0:37:44] <+kcsnipes> makes sense i mean
[0:37:49] <NarcissistCactus> schools: use fahrenheit also schools: water boils at 100 degrees
[0:37:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> 0 is fuckin cold, 100 is fuckin hot. 50 is all right
[0:37:51] <%gatorafan> Kelvin is the one that matters Kappa
[0:37:52] <schleep_4dayz> idk I'm used to Fahrenheit
[0:37:55] <AndrewsLovesPizza> I know inches from porn :)

[0:38:10] <+cinder_chan> all 3 temperature units have their own reasons for 0-100
[0:38:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ggbhtg
[0:38:14] <Graxe_> Fahrenheit is based on human body temperature, if I recall

[0:38:38] <Darkyello> american and who else
[0:38:38] <Plugman86> people have different threshold for what they think is hot or cold
[0:38:39] <muniea3> °C × 1.8 + 32 = F
[0:38:39] <%masterpiecejeremy> the bonus of no one knowing the imperial system is everything can look like 9 inches
[0:38:42] <+Estuko> The US is the guy that picks a different character that deviates from any efficiency JUST because they don't want to be the same to anyone else

[0:47:29] <PhantomMaskJr> Zabuza klinkCry
[0:47:30] <hassanico2> He still lost to Kakashi, no shame in that

[0:47:33] <MyNameIsRasus> ore wa mou shindeiru
[0:47:33] <R3c0n31> I mean the nine tails was also involved in that fight
[0:47:33] <prime_name> This resurrection jutsu seems like a rough deal on both ends.
[0:47:38] <+hell_spoon> @saiyan24675 I mean, all he would remember is damn near crushing his ribs with his elbow lmao
[0:47:41] <phatmac16> BIG JOBBER
[0:47:41] <天使42199> @ClaudeMcGarren I see thanks
[0:47:43] <rosabellamelantha> Zabuza:FUCK SASUKE CREW
[0:47:44] <niddron> what do you mean you remember that day?! it was just a moment ago for him
[0:47:45] <333agus333> Dude, at this point kakashi can probably beat them both with a hand tied to his back
[0:47:46] <+Manderson1998> @htt0r1hnz0 Kabuto uses the reanimation jutsu to revive dead enemies and allies as soldiers for madara
[0:47:46] <+AmaranthSparrow> Naruto's words cut deeper than any blade.
[0:47:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Haku underated trap
[0:47:48] <Personified134> ok didn't kabuto say to shut up and fight 30 seconds ago
[0:47:53] <saiyan24675> @hell_spoon oh yeah
[0:47:53] <%jake_protagonist> money fight
[0:47:54] <biomegabear> fight the ice mirrors againt
[0:48:01] <htt0r1hnz0> @Manderson1998 o ok thx
[0:48:05] <%jinking79> and Woolie just miss a detail
[0:48:13] <+Bluydee> there's two levels of resurrection
[0:48:16] <Pat_Squared> kabuto says at one point that he keeps their personality for psychological warfare reasons
[0:48:17] <hassanico2> Basically Kabuto will take over if they get too uppity
[0:48:23] <haitakaa> ninja souls Kappa
[0:48:25] <PhantomMaskJr> @ballerswagbro9k don’t start this bronzeBLICKY_HF tsbDrip
[0:48:31] <TwinBat> woolie they just lost their personalities and are being forced to fight
[0:48:44] <%LeaIsChill> Hey Woolie, what did Kabuto just say though
[0:48:46] <+Bluydee> the first level they obey Kabuto but are able to think and speak and can undermine their orders
[0:48:49] <%s_xylocalsingles> Woolie they’re reanimated Zombies
[0:48:52] <thexiiilightning> Kabuto has full control over the Puppets. But he doesn't have to waste as much chakra controlling those who willingly fight.
[0:48:53] <%s_xylocalsingles> yes
[0:48:54] <+PlagueOfGripes> kikashi has to fight a 2v1
[0:48:56] <niddron> dude...
[0:49:00] <+AWr00tBear> Yes the more control the less powerful they are. It’ll be more obvious when we see the dead hokage again.
[0:49:04] <haitakaa> woolie just wait and watch questions will be answered
[0:49:05] <%s_xylocalsingles> they’re body controlled reanimated zombies
[0:49:05] <TwinBat> WHO KNOWS?!
[0:49:09] <hassanico2> This doesn't look like a good budget fight
[0:49:12] <+Bluydee> the second level they can't think and the summoner has full control but it takes more brainpower
[0:49:15] <niddron> @plagueofgripes but he has sakur- oh I get it
[0:49:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAIT WHAT?
[0:49:19] <+AmaranthSparrow> There's a hierarchy of commands they have to follow.
[0:49:23] <%LeaIsChill> @hassanico2 Big budget fight is another phase
[0:49:25] <%Exiliator> Dont you have to shove a kunai in the back of their heads
[0:49:27] <%Exiliator> yeah yeah

[0:55:01] <Personified134> its his brother
[0:55:01] <thexiiilightning> Zabuza's sword is ALWAYS sharp. It uses the iron in people's blood to restore its sharpness
[0:55:01] <Kirby_Sauce> that's his bro
[0:55:02] <BlacSoul> is his big bro
[0:55:09] <%LeaIsChill> He took Zabuza's sword
[0:55:09] <Carnuno> There is a guy in boruto that kills himself with that explosion sword
[0:55:10] <%VidulaSaix> No Suigetsu took Zabuzas sword
[0:55:11] <+fatman19071> Mangetsu learned all of the swordstyles of the mist
[0:55:15] <%Exiliator> big brains Woolie!
[0:55:17] <shinji_ifrit> nah, Suigetsu has Zabuza's
[0:55:17] <+captain_history> it's him yeah
[0:55:21] <ProudlyDrowsy> Suigetsu has Zabuzza's sword
[0:55:25] <%Exiliator> or nice eyes I guess
[0:55:34] <NarcissistCactus> shut up
[0:55:35] <%LeaIsChill> Suigetsu loses Zabuza's sword in the Five Kage Summit
[0:55:40] <MyNameIsRasus> shut up
[0:55:40] <thexiiilightning> Zabuza summoned the sword
[0:55:40] <%VidulaSaix> Shut up its cool thats why
[0:55:41] <niddron> shut up though
[0:55:42] <%gatorafan> because SHUT UP
[0:55:42] <%jake_protagonist> It's explained in the anime. The sword teleports to Zabuza
[0:55:45] <helidzz> He loses it at the kage summit
[0:55:47] <hassanico2> The other sword that's missing is with one of the Mizukage's guards right?
[0:55:48] <+MrRabbles> shut up its ninja magic LUL
[0:55:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS FIIIIIIIINE
[0:55:54] <+Bluydee> Mangetsu's sword isn't stated but it's probably Chojuro's sword
[0:55:58] <Carnuno> I dont remember the hammer dude
[0:55:59] <+EXSeraph> it gets taken at the kage summit
[0:56:02] <+AmaranthSparrow> Zabuza summoned it.
[0:56:05] <wendigo172> He loses the sword at the summit
[0:56:08] <Malikwest11> think tobi took it
[0:56:09] <AMDBR9S> kiba sword
[0:56:11] <+PeanutJesus> I forgot this far in, Sasuke still hadn't made the turn to good
[0:56:13] <sectzodia> Hey super weebs, are they based on folklore?
[0:56:14] <haitakaa> meh they get their clothes back as well,
[0:56:16] <+fatman19071> Ameyuri Ringo uses swords Kiba which was from the anime originally but they thought it was cool enough to be cannon
[0:56:17] <+paladinstarbuster> you can make more swords guys
[0:56:18] <Dragon_Batman> there is an dull axe chained to the hammer
[0:56:19] <Pat_Squared> if the sword isn't currently being held by someone, its gets summoned by suigetsu's older brother
[0:56:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Last one is the coolest
[0:56:19] <AMDBR9S> needle sword
[0:56:23] <+dredgyboi> Yeah these guys were kinda a huge disappointment
[0:56:27] <+JacknZack27> Didn’t zabuzas sword get stolen back at some point
[0:56:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AFRO SAMURAI LUL
[0:56:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's a NEEDLE sword
[0:56:34] <cochramd1992> Daily reminder that Sasuke did EVERYTHING wrong
[0:56:40] <niddron> it's part of his mask
[0:56:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:56:40] <BlacSoul> its probaly a hat
[0:56:41] <%LeaIsChill> Sasuke's a punk
[0:56:45] <wanocountry> Demon Slayer Pillars > these guys tbh
[0:56:46] <Alienparasiteguy67> YEAH
[0:56:50] <+ggbhtg> There's NO TIME, just enjoy these CHARACTER DESIGNS
[0:56:51] <stanlychicken> They won't
[0:56:54] <%masterpiecejeremy> in the manga, Zabuza used a sumoning jutsu to get his sword and Suigetsu just went "wtf, where'd it go"
[0:56:54] <NarcissistCactus> disappintment
[0:56:54] <hassanico2> LOW BUDGET FIGHT Gooooooo
[0:56:54] <xxxJahrio> show me what you got
[0:57:02] <%VidulaSaix> Can't be too impressive if they're all dead 4Head
[0:57:02] <adamisfruit> Sasuke did nothing wrong
[0:57:03] <Pat_Squared> though actually I think that zabuza's sword is just given back to him normally because suigetsu got captured and they took his sword
[0:57:09] <$Noponiz> the demon slayer pillars are really not a high bar for group of cool guys
[0:57:10] <phatmac16> Big disappointment
[0:57:11] <cochramd1992> Sakura you ignorant slut
[0:57:11] <Carnuno> Its big garbo
[0:57:13] <+Superbro64> SHUT UP SAKURA

[0:58:10] <Ianrazz> Minh they are not the seven swordsmen, the are just pretenders thats why they suck
[0:58:24] <+ggbhtg> Konoha Warriors

[0:59:34] <Dragon_Batman> they summon almost all of them
[0:59:37] <Shishi1205> it sounds wrong in english
[0:59:43] <+AmaranthSparrow> Yes, except for Sharkskin and Flounder
[0:59:47] <%Exiliator> Gotcha
[0:59:47] <aracon_> lmao just opening and closing the gate over and over
[0:59:48] <%VidulaSaix> Gai just showing Lee how lame he is

[0:59:50] <%VidulaSaix> Opens gates casually
[0:59:51] <biomegabear> is that 5th gate?
[0:59:51] <Personified134> Guy opens gates for a living, he's got that shit on lock
[0:59:58] <+ggbhtg> well, Gai IS the coolest
[1:00:04] <%VidulaSaix> Gai is pretty damn cool

[1:00:16] <Carnuno> Yes, Suis brother summons all of the swords, hes like the water boi of the swords
[1:00:21] <wanocountry> Asakujaku sounds lame af in English ResidentSleeper
[1:00:21] <NarcissistCactus> asakujaku
[1:00:24] <%Exiliator> That doesnt sound great
[1:00:24] <+ClaudeMcGarren> ASAKUJAU
[1:00:26] <BigLegs911> asakujaku
[1:00:27] <Reckless_Rob> @Sapphire_Breeze I know right
[1:00:27] <+fatman19071> Guy is one of the strongest (for a brief time)
[1:00:30] <Pat_Squared> I don't think the game shows what zabuza's sword's special ability is
[1:00:31] <BlacSoul> AsAkUjAkUUUU
[1:00:33] <PunishedMercer_> they couldn't have done something different for each one?
[1:00:35] <Personified134> I'm so glad that of all the sensei supporting cast, Gai gets so much play for the last chunks of shippuden
[1:00:41] <$Noponiz> they are fighting the greatest war of their lives
[1:00:42] <Personified134> Gai is fucking awesome
[1:00:43] <haitakaa> yeah just watch this fight in the anime it's still not great tho
[1:00:44] <phatmac16> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:00:45] <niddron> you'll get one of those woolie
[1:00:45] <$Chumblago13> Didn't Guy's dad also beat all the 7 Ninja Swordsman alone as well?
[1:00:45] <$Noponiz> ofc he would open the gate
[1:00:53] <BearSawed> Guy is awesome just because of the ending, until its not....fuckin deus ex machina
[1:00:53] <NarcissistCactus> asakujaku
[1:00:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Gai is the fucking best
[1:00:56] <Sedrelic> latin-american guy is the 2nd best guy
[1:01:00] <%VidulaSaix> Yeah cause Lee was trash with it
[1:01:05] <%jake_protagonist> Well if you open the 8th you ADO die
[1:01:06] <niddron> well ..
[1:01:08] <%jake_protagonist> DO*
[1:01:08] <MyNameIsRasus> you die if you open all 8
[1:01:09] <+askalta> thats how every jutsu was first described lol
[1:01:09] <Malikwest11> they are DTs
[1:01:10] <Dragon_Batman> cuz he is like 12 doing it
[1:01:11] <thexiiilightning> He didn't beat them. but he held them off and saved his unit
[1:01:11] <cochramd1992> opening gates isn't dangerous unless you're a wimp Kappa
[1:01:12] <$Noponiz> dub guy sounds AGGRESSIVELY like ZAP from futurama
[1:01:14] <Personified134> Lee was a noob, Gai is just used to it
[1:01:17] <eddi401> Cause Lee was a child
[1:01:17] <+AmaranthSparrow> It's a shame they didn't do more with this fight in the anime. Kishimoto left it to the imagination mostly, and the anime dropped the ball.
[1:01:17] <Carnuno> I think he died fighting them tho
[1:01:19] <Arblaster_> "Lee, you're gonna be crippled for life"
[1:01:27] <Arblaster_> Next day Lee kills the big bad
[1:01:27] <niddron> "I DECLARE YOU THE STRONGEST"
[1:01:27] <BlacSoul> i like his dub, not that line read
[1:01:28] <King_Clod> The gates are still dangerous. Lee was just inexperienced with it
[1:01:30] <hassanico2> "IS that budget?!"

[1:01:57] <niddron> it never comes up again
[1:01:57] <biomegabear> @Grayhammatter I know right?
[1:01:57] <Personified134> Gaara crippled him, not just the gates @WoolieVersus

[1:07:14] <Personified134> Zabuza stop being tsun and just give haku a smooch
[1:07:14] <MyNameIsRasus> no chakra, just like the anime
[1:07:16] <$Chumblago13> Kakashi used a genjutus to mess with Zabuza and influence Zabuza to use certain techniques. It was a power of suggestion thing which is why is seemed like Kakshi was copying Zabuza at the same time. (Confirmed not just a theory)
[1:07:19] <BlacSoul> owari

[1:28:02] <+JingKaisean> who the fuck are these filler chars?
[1:28:04] <%LeaIsChill> They have the Kyuubi chakra!
[1:28:04] <+CoronetChris> Are these two based on enemies from Journey to the West?
[1:28:05] <+fatman19071> remember how naruto just forgives kabuto and he opens an orphanage
[1:28:09] <+AmaranthSparrow> I think in Japanese Black Hunting is pronounced like an English word.
[1:28:10] <Carnuno> So the thing about these guys is that the urn they have sucks the person in if they say the word they say most often and his paper sword tells him that word
[1:28:10] <wendigo172> These two aren’t playable btw
[1:28:11] <+Arnschen> I forgot, these designs are kinda...eh
[1:28:11] <%LeaIsChill> Voring his stomach gave it to them

[1:28:19] <Memitim> @fatman19071 spoilers?
[1:28:19] <%VidulaSaix> And gained a small amount of its power
[1:28:22] <+UrielCobalt> The gourd works off some Yu Yu Hakusho territory rules
[1:28:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> VORE
[1:28:22] <hassanico2> They HAVE Ninetails Chakra!
[1:28:28] <lotharrio> They ate their way out.
[1:28:28] <niddron> THEY ATE SOME OF THE NINE TAIL
[1:28:28] <%Exiliator> They got super chakra from it
[1:28:33] <+ggbhtg> now they've got HIS POWER
[1:28:35] <NarcissistCactus> suc

[1:28:39] <shadow13jay> They called him little Bronze in manga
[1:28:39] <+fatman19071> @memitim it's been years at this point
[1:28:40] <%LeaIsChill> Naruto has like, 40% Kyuubi. These guys have 10%
[1:28:42] <stanlychicken> Butt succ
[1:28:43] <lotharrio> And became pseudo jinchuriki.
[1:28:43] <hassanico2> Actually, them having Ninteails Chakra is super important as a result
[1:28:49] <+RJay80> the S U C C
[1:28:52] <Ianrazz> Poor Zetsu is getting butt sucked
[1:29:01] <wanocountry> These are the guys that defeated Second Hokage? LUL
[1:29:10] <+UrielCobalt> they don't even have 10%, they are just stronger than the average ninja
[1:29:17] <RpgFoLife> I thought they gave the nine tails diarrhea?
[1:29:21] <%LeaIsChill> They have Kyuubi forms tho
[1:29:22] <Zedkan> this game seems uh...questionable
[1:29:25] <hassanico2> Ok now I remember, it's swinging that fan that drains all your chakra, and Tenten tried using it and knocked herself out
[1:29:26] <xxxJahrio> the weapons are a refrence to journey to the west
[1:29:27] <lotharrio> It's a Journey to the West thing, Minh.

[1:29:37] <R3c0n31> Mafuba
[1:29:38] <ProudlyDrowsy> they're using the weapons of the Sage of the Six Paths too
[1:29:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> them'
[1:29:42] <NarcissistCactus> they ate out the nine tails and got spat out
[1:29:42] <Mendin> Evil Containment Wave aka Mafuba
[1:29:43] <SideChar> in the rice cooker
[1:29:45] <calebhardman21> Mafuba
[1:29:49] <cochramd1992> a rice cooker
[1:29:50] <Shishi1205> do we recomend woolie watching this battle so he gets context for the gourd words shenanigans?
[1:29:51] <calebhardman21> rice cooker

[1:36:35] <SPKTR34> @biomegabear bruh we're watching naruto lmao
[1:36:37] <+Bluydee> damn I've completely lost track of how the game progresses cuz now I have zero clue when the statue happens and the big one

[1:36:44] <reiju_22> atpFeelsBeardMan atpFeelsBeardMan atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:36:44] <HolisticField> i have approximate knowledge of many things
[1:36:46] <Sedrelic> i dont like english shikamaru
[1:36:48] <lotharrio> Yo spoilers, this Naruto guy? He's actually Boruto's dad.
[1:36:48] <cochramd1992> there's a statue?
[1:36:48] <Ianrazz> Youtube why didn't you recommend flat earth videos or anti vax vids instead of giving Woolie the spoilers???
[1:36:49] <%gatorafan> yeah, sorry Kappa
[1:36:57] <biomegabear> @SPKTR34 bruh its not the 80s or 90s dubs
[1:36:57] <$Chumblago13> The statue is Storm 4
[1:36:58] <zamzoph> @HolisticField me too LUL
[1:36:58] <saiyan24675> @Dragon_Batman no not yet
[1:36:59] <hassanico2> @Bluydee If you mean THAT statue, uh, Naruto isn't even here yet so probably in a bit
[1:37:00] <%LeaIsChill> Hit the button on Hero
[1:37:03] <+Manderson1998> ninja tools!
[1:37:07] <%LeaIsChill> There you go
[1:37:08] <%hitorio> !uptime
[1:37:09] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 37 minutes
[1:37:14] <$Chumblago13> the game goes as far as right at a big encounter. that's all I can say
[1:37:16] <%LeaIsChill> Need to level up
[1:37:20] <PhantomMaskJr> rawrSip I’m gonna spoiler everything
[1:37:21] <SPKTR34> @biomegabear but those were good, atleast where i live
[1:37:21] <@Solidus_113> You needn to be lvl 3 Hero
[1:37:23] <Zbyrd0961> need bigger hero level
[1:37:24] <+Manderson1998> you need to level it up
[1:37:24] <+Chosington> you need to level up Woolie.
[1:37:25] <rosemon5001> LVL 3 your 2
[1:37:25] <+shinigami40297> level up hero
[1:37:27] <harpsichord_uiy> @WoolieVersus level up
[1:37:31] <wanocountry> Asuma weakest Sarutobi
[1:37:35] <Syvar> the statue is after asuma
[1:37:35] <Dragon_Batman> @saiyan24675 he should have went to see it cuz it was before this
[1:37:41] <PhantomMaskJr> Spoil*
[1:37:42] <Dragon_Batman> Shanme
[1:37:43] <hassanico2> @Chumblago13 I think you can safely say "The game makes up a Madara fight to end it" and it wouldn't really be a spoiler
[1:37:46] <cochramd1992> lame
[1:37:47] <+Manderson1998> this is why you go back to replay the main missions
[1:37:49] <xGOMIEx> Level is to low
[1:37:50] <lotharrio> Low level shit tier. Get bigger numbers.
[1:37:52] <hassanico2> @Chumblago13 Since it's totally made up filler
[1:37:52] <rheviel> The English VA does pull me out of having the proper emotions for the scenes
[1:37:57] <@Solidus_113> You get xp for both on legend
[1:37:57] <TopTierHarley> you guys really can't read huh
[1:37:59] <Zbyrd0961> Stick with legend
[1:37:59] <biomegabear> @SPKTR34 depends on the show but yeah
[1:38:02] <invader_rin> That's dumb
[1:38:06] <+Manderson1998> you can replay the missions
[1:38:06] <%VidulaSaix> Yeah the ending of this game is actually slightly filler
[1:38:08] <irfan_> Hero is for healing, Legend is for offensive items
[1:38:09] <%VidulaSaix> But NUNS4 fixes it
[1:38:12] <$Chumblago13> Fair point chat
[1:38:13] <Dragon_Batman> Cuz you a legend yo
[1:38:14] <niddron> @wanocountry because he was too busy it his girl
[1:38:14] <%Exiliator> @rheviel same
[1:38:22] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus this dumb shit is gone in storm 4
[1:38:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CUZ LEGENDS DONT USE HEALING
[1:38:27] <RpgFoLife> You need to buy level 2 items but yeah its dumb
[1:38:31] <+paladinstarbuster> easy mode is hero so they give you heals
[1:38:31] <hassanico2> @VidulaSaix Theonly thing Iresent about NUNS4 is using Anime stills for half the game cutscnes
[1:38:35] <wanocountry> Legends never die yuh
[1:38:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> jUST EAT BENTOS FOR DEFENSE
[1:38:36] <Graxe_> Legends only use buffs, not heals
[1:38:36] <+CrowGuy> because LEGENDS GIT GUD
[1:38:36] <Dragon_Batman> Who needs healing when your a legend
[1:38:37] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> legends never stop going in
[1:38:37] <SPKTR34> winners don't use healing items!
[1:38:44] <+sindrantz> HEALING IS FOR PUNKS
[1:38:44] <cydonis137> recovery is healing
[1:38:45] <Ianrazz> Legends don't need to heal WOOLIE
[1:38:46] <irfan_> basically coward out so you can coward out even more with healing
[1:38:46] <rheviel> Baby Mode items
[1:38:51] <hassanico2> ONLY HEROES Heal
[1:38:55] <aracon_> real gamers don't need healing items tsbBis
[1:38:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:38:57] <%gatorafan> You don't become legendary by healing like a coward Kappa
[1:38:58] <niddron> enhances sexual prowess!
[1:38:58] <%jinking79> Hero defense Legends offensive
[1:38:59] <BlacSoul> JUST WIN
[1:39:00] <lotharrio> Too much of a legend. Not a big enough hero.
[1:39:02] <CaramelTaffy> Heroes get remembered, but Legends never die!
[1:39:10] <hassanico2> Reggie is pleased with this

[1:40:00] <favadem> you absolutely need healing items on later boss fights tho
[1:40:04] <hassanico2> Yo nice knives!
[1:40:05] <%VidulaSaix> Asuma's wind blades are so rad
[1:40:07] <+ElementalX1000> Bruh I'm just standing here
[1:40:14] <%hitorio> In canon, Choji had a tough time fighting Asuma because of his feelings
[1:40:14] <niddron> @ianrazz because in the anime he also didn't want to fight asuna
[1:40:14] <+ggbhtg> Choji REFUSES to fight
[1:40:15] <+CrowGuy> Choji english voice is... nah
[1:40:21] <Dragon_Batman> Choji is conflicted in this fight and doesn't want to fight Asuma
[1:40:23] <%Exiliator> Oh god they are team 10! thats awful
[1:40:23] <+LordPyre> crazy you just call choji out and he vibin
[1:40:23] <Personified134> Choji can't do it, thats good lore
[1:40:26] <%masterpiecejeremy> yeh Team 10 vs Asuma. Logan.
[1:40:26] <%gatorafan> No help from friend!
[1:40:27] <wendigo172> Choji isn’t fighting lmao
[1:40:30] <wanocountry> Tenten is more useful than Choji LUL
[1:40:32] <cochramd1992> Choji shut up
[1:40:34] <stanlychicken> The chackra blades are kinda boring tbh
[1:40:34] <aracon_> christ choji pull it together you weenie
[1:40:35] <muniea3> dagger knucks
[1:40:36] <hassanico2> OH MY GOD
[1:40:36] <+AmaranthSparrow> Trench knives
[1:40:37] <+UrielCobalt> Asuma is cool, though he never reached the level of his dad 3rd hokage
[1:40:39] <+Bane_Kaikyo> bloody ads
[1:40:41] <hassanico2> Choji is just fucking Solid Snaking this scene!
[1:40:45] <+RJay80> love how choji comes out and do nothing
[1:40:51] <+ggbhtg> No help FROM FRIEND
[1:40:54] <hassanico2> is the Choji assist literally just "NO I CAN'T DO IT"?!
[1:40:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS NO USE
[1:41:05] <Iggeh0> Choji is the worst character in Naruto
[1:41:10] <harpsichord_uiy> Shikamaru is goat
[1:41:12] <Ianrazz> Its just funny in this epic fight, he just stands there LUL
[1:41:14] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Awakenings have Ults
[1:41:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TIME TO FLY
[1:41:19] <%gatorafan> Nah Choji is alright
[1:41:21] <+Rabbitmage> Choji is fat. Fuck fat people.
[1:41:21] <%Exiliator> Choji is a great dad
[1:41:23] <+UrielCobalt> Chouji puts in work in the original fight
[1:41:25] <Zbyrd0961> SMART
[1:41:26] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Awakenings DO HAVE ULTS
[1:41:30] <hassanico2> BTW What's Ino's assist? Explosive bouquet?
[1:41:36] <%hitorio> Shikamaru with anyone else's power >>>>>
[1:41:36] <+AmaranthSparrow> @iggeh0 got any other bad takes?
[1:41:37] <phatmac16> Sakura is the worst
[1:41:38] <Dragon_Batman> yea
[1:41:42] <niddron> shikamaru can lose his shadow powers and still be too tier
[1:41:44] <cochramd1992> nothing
[1:41:51] <thexiiilightning> You'll see now
[1:41:51] <+fatman19071> not yet at least
[1:41:54] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Awakenings DO HAVE ULTS sir
[1:41:55] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is it going? did boruto unlock super ultra instinct?
[1:41:55] <ProudlyDrowsy> i think Sai's the worst tbh
[1:41:56] <cochramd1992> Intelligence builds OP
[1:41:57] <%hitorio> Imagine Shikamaru with Tsunade strength and 9000 IQ ways to land a hit on you
[1:41:57] <biomegabear> ino is a support character in terms of ability
[1:41:59] <Iggeh0> @AmaranthSparrow your birth was not a mistake
[1:41:59] <+Taglog7> SHIKA BRAIN
[1:42:01] <hassanico2> Ino went all in on the Flower shop gimmick
[1:42:02] <zamzoph> I feel that Ino's power was came up with solely to play off of Inner Sakura... and then Inner Sakura stopped being a thing immediately fter
[1:42:04] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Awakenings DO HAVE ULTS sir.
[1:42:06] <Dragon_Batman> She does get a little impressive in how she can use it like her father
[1:42:10] <GoldeNOVA> Lee could be the protag, Shikamaru could be the protag, Naruto sucks.
[1:42:10] <%LeaIsChill> @ggbhtg You can't use ults in Awakenings. You don't need to spam either
[1:42:11] <htt0r1hnz0> Like Pixies?
[1:42:15] <Ianrazz> Sakura is literaly the WORST craicPepeDrk
[1:42:18] <+UrielCobalt> Sakura is a lame character, though they made her somewhat of a Mary sue later, she has nothing original about her kit though
[1:42:19] <harpsichord_uiy> man i am so hype to see part 7 animated eventually
[1:42:28] <+fatman19071> Ino is best girl
[1:42:28] <@Solidus_113> MAMORU
[1:42:40] <NarcissistCactus> your nakama
[1:42:41] <cochramd1992> wait what
[1:42:42] <hassanico2> @UrielCobalt wait how, she straight up does nothing important to warrant being called that
[1:42:42] <Lapinelis> Choji sounds 10
[1:42:42] <%VidulaSaix> His voice is just way too high pitched
[1:42:44] <%jimmytwofeet> VOW OF CELIBACY
[1:42:46] <%hitorio> A Mary Sue is someone with no flaws who cannot grow and auto-succeeds at everything.
[1:42:48] <cochramd1992> did Choji already get married?
[1:42:49] <%VidulaSaix> It works for younger Choji but not this Choji
[1:42:49] <+paladinstarbuster> CONFIDENCE?
[1:42:50] <lotharrio> Sakura during every major fight she's in, "It's not going to be like before. I've gotten stronger, too!"
[1:42:53] <+ggbhtg> @leaischill I'm big wrong? I don't know man...

[1:48:45] <+captain_history> yeah but Naruto was there too
[1:48:51] <$Noponiz> the line makes perfect sense. he is mentally in control, but not in terms of body. So he is glad that he knows he cant get out

[1:51:47] <NarcissistCactus> reggie no
[1:51:49] <+UrielCobalt> @Exiliator Being smart =/= the only smart person, nor does it equate with power mastery, or getting exclusive private training from the Hokage. Even Sarutobii was too busy for Konohamaru. What did Sakura even prove early on? That she learned no jutsu before Tsunafe training? If anything its just further proof she fdidn't deserve those private lessons.
[1:51:52] <Dragon_Batman> Woolie that is still his soul
[1:51:56] <Personified134> Anko got it the worst out of anybody tbh

[1:52:21] <lotharrio> They totally have taste.

[2:10:57] <aracon_> I honestly forgot this game had kaiju battles
[2:11:02] <Kirby_Sauce> chackra shuriken
[2:11:10] <+masked_hero_lucky> Substitute a tree
[2:11:10] <%heartbbyy> it has a bunch of kaiju in the end
[2:11:13] <niddron> @kyh9 dude we aren't even there yet, we're going FURTHER
[2:11:23] <hassanico2> The SFX are soooo busted
[2:11:23] <+Bluydee> @kyh9 the series opens with a giant fox fighting a giant toad
[2:11:26] <lotharrio> You do a substitution and it's still just a normal sized piece of wood.
[2:11:27] <+ggbhtg> Fuck the rain forest Kappa
[2:11:28] <+Pompadourius> Wait, is this the Naruto game with the weird ending?
[2:11:28] <muniea3> Ino would actually be useful here
[2:11:34] <EndgameContent> It's a WWE drop
[2:11:40] <+UrielCobalt> Chouji is attitude era
[2:11:42] <%hitorio> @UrielCobalt Yeah, just explaining how specialized he is as a "class"
[2:11:43] <NarcissistCactus> geda statue selling it hard
[2:11:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:11:46] <Arek_1> You would need Wood Release to spawna lobig. LUL
[2:11:46] <CozyGUNNA> @pompadourius yup

[2:11:55] <Arek_1> Wow.
[2:11:58] <%gatorafan> weeeelllllll
[2:11:58] <NarcissistCactus> it's ability to suck
[2:11:59] <+Superbro64> reminder that this gedo statue is probably several hunderes thousands tons, reggie
[2:12:02] <niddron> it's like a Tupperware for chakra
[2:12:04] <BlacSoul> wellll
[2:12:07] <+Pompadourius> @CozyGUNNA Gotcha. Well, that's gonna be good to see again. lol
[2:12:07] <+ElementalX1000> Gettho Statue is here to sell
[2:12:08] <+ggbhtg> Storm Generations is Storm 3.5, I think
[2:12:11] <+captain_history> Gedo Statue doesn't know how to sell
[2:12:11] <BigLegs911> this looks sooo clunky
[2:12:16] <Arek_1> You would need Wood Release to spawn a log tht big.* LUL
[2:12:21] <+masked_hero_lucky> THANK YOU MINH
[2:12:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Slowness for scale
[2:12:24] <hassanico2> @ggbhtg Revolution?
[2:12:24] <%hitorio> @nicksippin Fav character? In Part 1: Rock Lee. In Part 2: ... I'm going with Naruto because the most enjoyment I got out of Naruto by the end of the series was him nuking shit
[2:12:25] <EndgameContent> Big things move proportionally slower
[2:12:26] <+Pompadourius> @ggbhtg Nah, Generations is Storm 2.5.
[2:12:28] <+masked_hero_lucky> It still looks cool though
[2:12:30] <agadejobi> What in the hell? Since when could Choji turn into a giant?
[2:12:41] <+ggbhtg> ok ok
[2:12:42] <+killogram123> bigger they aren the slower they are proportional to us
[2:12:45] <Dragon_Batman> Body expansion specialty
[2:12:47] <MattDemers> Dota 2 uses one of the electricity sound effects for Storm Spirit's Ball Lightning
[2:12:49] <hassanico2> @agadejobi two fights ago
[2:12:50] <Syvar> since part 1
[2:12:50] <+fatman19071> Revolution is 3.5
[2:12:52] <+Bluydee> Revolution is 3.5
[2:12:52] <Kirby_Sauce> did he use a jutsu?
[2:13:00] <+Pompadourius> Generations was just the Danzo arc but no story battles or QTEs at all, just fights.
[2:13:01] <EuropanLamprey> Imagine a giant able to move at a Ninja's relative speed. They'd flash step and a nuclear explosion just goes off from the force
[2:13:07] <+Superbro64> maybe it works theoritically, wouldnt you be slower, because you have more air particles to move through or something?
[2:13:07] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it's a family Jutsu
[2:13:09] <333agus333> Reminder that an elephant can run up to 40kmh
[2:13:09] <%hitorio> Rock Lee was legit the hypest motherfucker in the series in Part 1 for me
[2:13:11] <agadejobi> Man, I thought I had a vague idea of time-skip Naruto. Turns out I've got no idea
[2:13:13] <+fatman19071> Revolution is the only game I've ever pre-ordered
[2:13:14] <Kirby_Sauce> no
[2:13:17] <+Superbro64> anyone in chat a scientist?
[2:13:17] <Kirby_Sauce> i mean...
[2:13:27] <hassanico2> Remember ROBO Naruto though
[2:13:28] <biomegabear> need more chakra?
[2:13:32] <+UrielCobalt> that statue is pretty strong in the manga, and has healing factor
[2:13:32] <NarcissistCactus> big things usually move slower
[2:13:35] <Kirby_Sauce> did woolie use the jutsu move
[2:13:36] <%hitorio> @agadejobi to be fair, this is the war arc, where a punch of new tech is revealed by Kishi
[2:13:37] <%heartbbyy> this statue must play Guile in SFV
[2:13:38] <AmericanaRed> hadoken
[2:13:39] <helidzz> Wooie pls charge

[2:14:57] <PhantomMaskJr> Bowser Kaiju battles > this
[2:14:58] <niddron> the point is not to have fun
[2:15:04] <invader_rin> It's different
[2:15:06] <+Vikingdeath1> Naruto is not about "Fun"
[2:15:08] <+Superbro64> its a CC2 game, what did you expect?
[2:15:11] <cochramd1992> no blockbreaker combo??
[2:15:14] <%mistspade> mistspade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! hey 1 year

[2:15:26] <RICE02> Naruto is about Glory
[2:15:26] <+AmaranthSparrow> Can't you chakra dash in this fight?
[2:15:30] <+Superbro64> CC2 doesnt do fun or compelling, they do cutscenes you play
[2:15:30] <helidzz> you can
[2:15:31] <@Solidus_113> you can
[2:15:36] <helidzz> but Woolie is just not doing it
[2:15:42] <HolisticField> this is what people who buy a ninja game wanna play right?
[2:15:42] <Kirby_Sauce> ate the raw super
[2:15:44] <EuropanLamprey> Woolie is getting zoned hard
[2:15:45] <Dragon_Batman> Can you focus on just dodging?
[2:15:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES U CAN CHAKRA DASH
[2:15:55] <+UrielCobalt> what a way to catch up on Naruto lol. The manga chaters would take less time to get through, and show more, though you wouldn't be able to share that with an audience I guess.
[2:15:55] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus you can chakra dask
[2:16:00] <+ggbhtg> fuckin...
[2:16:10] <EndgameContent> Getting closer gives you more time to punch
[2:16:12] <+JacknZack27> Im pretty sure he was chakra dashing at the start, but then stopped
[2:16:17] <AMstone776> oh god woolie is doing his unga move while they are blocking
[2:16:22] <Dragon_Batman> What if it's a "bullet hell survive" type of thing
[2:16:23] <%hitorio> @UrielCobalt yeah; the sharing is what makes this medium worthwhile.
[2:16:29] <Arnoldoaad1> did the statue NINJA RUN
[2:16:44] <CozyGUNNA> i actually like this approach to catch up tbh
[2:16:46] <itesket> Choji just a little longer I’m almost there Kreygasm
[2:16:51] <Heartless_01> nice
[2:16:53] <%hitorio> @UrielCobalt Plus some legit cool moments when CyberConnect decides to be beast animators
[2:16:53] <+Pompadourius> @UrielCobalt Whenever CC2 adapts a fight as a cutscene and QTE filled cinematic experience, it's the optimal way imo. If it's a normal fight though, then yeah, manga or anime.
[2:17:01] <+Diabetic> wait this is a kaiju choji battle and he's fucking Mothra? @WoolieVersus
[2:17:08] <CozyGUNNA> @pompadourius agreed
[2:17:11] <+UrielCobalt> true
[2:17:13] <NarcissistCactus> real bullet hells
[2:17:13] <+AWr00tBear> Just stay out of range then chakra dash in after a successful dodging one of his attack
[2:17:16] <%hitorio> How many rasenshurikens would it take to body this version of Choji?
[2:17:28] <aracon_> hggSleep hggSleep
[2:17:39] <Arek_1> Manga for speed, anime for animation and soundtrack, game for the few cool QTEs it has.
[2:17:39] <+fatman19071> you have to wiff punish
[2:17:40] <Dragon_Batman> Knowing NAruto probably just one
[2:17:48] <+Pompadourius> @hitorio A single Rasenshuriken would body anybody who doesn

[2:25:18] <$Noponiz> he just reminded him of the six path guy. No actual six path powers
[2:25:26] <%hitorio> There is an entire team from the Cloud Village that the Storm Games don't really acknowledge

[2:25:36] <+JacknZack27> I dont think naruto was using six paths powers.

[2:27:37] <%Polter_ge1st> No we don't Woolie
[2:27:37] <+Pompadourius> Hot take: Naruto as a character would've been so much cooler if his last power-up was Sage Mode as a symbol of the torch being passed from his master to him. Instead of Super Saiyan form here.
[2:27:39] <lotharrio> Euro-comic, at best.
[2:27:39] <HolisticField> the words i dont know could fill a dictionary

[2:28:11] <+AmaranthSparrow> I've definitely heard people use BD to refer to French comics. Japanese do too.

[2:28:13] <Arek_1> Claw?
[2:28:14] <%hitorio> @Pompadourius I think Sage Mode is the coolest mode Naruto has... but... that Kyubi mode's toolset is OD as fuck and I must respect it.

[2:31:33] <Dragon_Batman> It's known
[2:31:33] <lotharrio> Ajna is a jerk.
[2:31:36] <tigerfang86> LMAO
[2:31:42] <OldManDeckardCain> ajna is just goku LUL
[2:31:43] <%redrins> "some"
[2:31:44] <%hitorio> People hate Ajna? Gotta catch up on the Indivisible LP to see why
[2:31:46] <+Pompadourius> BIG JERK
[2:31:46] <cochramd1992> @Purplestuf10____0 that's a deterrent against locking him up again
[2:31:49] <+ggbhtg> Ajna is MC girl in Indivisible
[2:31:50] <phatmac16> Shes the worst
[2:31:53] <Dragon_Batman> @UrielCobalt The protag of Indivisible
[2:31:58] <+Manderson1998> @woolieversus when you have free movement and can save manually, seeing as you're playing on a ps3 and start opens the options or quit menu, hit select for the menu we're talking about. you can replay missions from it. That's the best way to get those hero points and secret actions you missed.
[2:31:58] <%lordsdb> I miss Dhar, he actully was getting really good (as a char)
[2:32:01] <+skyheys> @OldManDeckardCain Goku at least respects people.
[2:32:03] <+UrielCobalt> Oh, forgot how it was spelled
[2:32:05] <BigLegs911> #DharDidNothingWrong
[2:32:07] <SPKTR34> who's ajna
[2:32:07] <stranger59> It's all Ajna's dad's fault.
[2:32:25] <$Noponiz> 8 tails probably was like that as well. But they are past that
[2:32:34] <BlacSoul> mmmmweeeelllllllll
[2:32:38] <agadejobi> I'm going to start watching Indivisible
[2:32:42] <NarcissistCactus> SourPls

[2:32:46] <agadejobi> I want to see how awful this Ajna is
[2:32:47] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[2:32:49] <+Pompadourius> I mean in-universe, wasn't the eight tails just as violent as the nine tails, but Killer Bee was so chill that they just became bros after a while anyway?
[2:32:50] <lotharrio> Can't wait for Jujutsu Kaisen next year. Best "inner demon" plot so far.

[2:32:56] <%jinking79> at the same time Dhar killed a lot of ppl
[2:32:59] <+Superbro64> I see no reason why woolie would want to replay missions, like at all
[2:32:59] <TsunTsuchinoko> 8 tails just respects the Bee
[2:33:00] <%hitorio> I think we're already past the point where the manga flashes back on how Bee becomes the 8-Tails' jinchuuriki
[2:33:02] <+JacknZack27> The eight tails was kinda grumpy at first. But he and bee became bros
[2:33:07] <harpsichord_uiy> oof, these slant rhymes kill me
[2:33:08] <itesket> Who tf voiced this man
[2:33:16] <%hitorio> @Pompadourius I think that's how it happened; I recall him having gone on a rampage before
[2:33:19] <+LordAlexGram> The Ninetails Was forced to be civil servant and chain down for years of course he would kill his owners
[2:33:20] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> YEEAAAEAAH
[2:33:21] <%VidulaSaix> He's meant to be bad, thats why Bee is great LUL
[2:33:23] <+ggbhtg> There are at LEAST 50 YOUTUBE ANIME COMPILATION CHANNELS with that remix, I'm sure
[2:33:23] <+Superbro64> these rhymes are quite garbage
[2:33:24] <xdeathknightx> YYYYEEAAHHHH
[2:33:27] <xdeathknightx> OKAAAYYYY
[2:33:30] <+Bluydee> 8 tails killed all of its hosts and rampaged all the time before he and B become homies

[2:34:38] <%gatorafan> KILLER BEE DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:34:39] <%hitorio> How many people have insulted Killer Bee's flow in the series? I know Karin has
[2:34:39] <EndgameContent> You gotta admit, the way Bee moves is pretty cool
[2:34:40] <+UrielCobalt> Killer Bee translated lyrics are all over the place.
[2:34:42] <Dragon_Batman> I'm shure there is a little fear in there cuz, "lets not anger the 8 tails"
[2:34:43] <Sol_Install> don't put bee under the bus like that
[2:34:46] <niddron> this Naruto hits hard
[2:34:47] <+ggbhtg> Maximum Nalt, all day
[2:34:49] <Arblaster_> Naruto, the master of cheat codes
[2:34:51] <clack14> 🔥 on KevinTurtle island
[2:34:53] <+Grayhammatter> this power up is kinda busted it feels like
[2:34:57] <+masked_hero_lucky> Hey, remember when Naruto wanted to better himself through hard work? Screw that, free power ups
[2:34:58] <+fatman19071> using 7 swords at once is really cool
[2:34:59] <Arnoldoaad1> here is to partying like pornstars
[2:35:02] <agadejobi> You know what, say what you will about Naruto
[2:35:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:35:07] <itesket> Why doesn't killer bee have any glowy lightbulb shit
[2:35:10] <cochramd1992> so remind me what Naruto has done to "earn" this power
[2:35:11] <clack14> masked_hero_lucky why work when you can have a demon in you
[2:35:15] <%Afterman_> oh god i forgot he has kisames sword. that dude was the best nninja
[2:35:15] <+NiSoKr> This is an awakening so you don't have an ult
[2:35:16] <aracon_> wtf
[2:35:16] <Dragon_Batman> I think this is just Awakening mode
[2:35:20] <+Pompadourius> Oh yeah, I almost forgot they just kinda made this form of Naruto a playable character rather than a super mode.
[2:35:22] <%hitorio> @masked_hero_lucky he worked hard to put 100 Jumbo Rasengans into Kyubi's asshole
[2:35:22] <harpsichord_uiy> u h
[2:35:24] <+Pompadourius> That's weird.
[2:35:24] <agadejobi> I always get fucking excited whenever Naruto fights with his Shadow Clones
[2:35:29] <aracon_> just active hitbox for the whole thing
[2:35:33] <+paladinstarbuster> @masked_hero_lucky HE did work for this though
[2:35:39] <CozyGUNNA> hitbox
[2:35:47] <%hitorio> Naruto's bread 'n butter combos with his clones are actually kinda sick
[2:35:48] <kikosmore> he's limbering up
[2:35:54] <%hitorio> cooler than how he fights in series
[2:35:56] <lotharrio> Sage mode was cooler.
[2:36:03] <+UrielCobalt> They should have used the guys from Anarchy Reign or the TJ Combo rap to do Killer Bee's raps
[2:36:03] <aracon_> uh oh
[2:36:07] <Dragon_Batman> Cough cough he sensed something
[2:36:08] <+ggbhtg> uh oh
[2:36:09] <biomegabear> ?
[2:36:09] <clack14> rock lee had to work naruto just had to use his infinity gaunlent
[2:36:10] <+Grayhammatter> uh oh
[2:36:12] <+masked_hero_lucky> Naruto was born with a special bloodline, a super strong demon, trained by some of the greatest ninja ever, etc etc
[2:36:12] <itesket> Is there gonna be a BUNS for boruto
[2:36:13] <aracon_> his chakra senses are tingling
[2:36:15] <lotharrio> He can sense hatred or something, remember?
[2:36:18] <%VidulaSaix> Sage Mode, remember
[2:36:18] <+ElementalX1000> The Race War has begun
[2:36:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @lotharrio Wait and see
[2:36:20] <+ggbhtg> The Force....
[2:36:20] <+masked_hero_lucky> Naruto was handed success
[2:36:20] <Morning_Asakura> tingles
[2:36:22] <+Bluydee> transformations without transform sequences that just turn on are always sick to mne
[2:36:23] <Iggeh0> he can sense chakra with Sage Mode
[2:36:28] <%This_is_Marco> spidey sense?
[2:36:31] <niddron> Naruto missing out on the race war!
[2:36:32] <%gatorafan> ehhhh
[2:36:33] <Arek_1> Naruto won, like, a chakra tug-of-war with the Nine-Tails to get the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.
[2:36:36] <+Superbro64> they exist Im sure
[2:36:38] <CozyGUNNA> rock lee is the true mc
[2:36:38] <AMstone776> kinda, it was told to us when Kisame popped out
[2:36:39] <+nicdior> Newtype senses
[2:36:39] <+omenzazu> I just want to get the the kakashi part when he says "Sensei?"
[2:36:43] <Dragon_Batman> He senses hatred in this mode I believe
[2:36:50] <+Superbro64> they merchandised the heck out of this game
[2:36:50] <itesket> Turtle necks just feel bad
[2:36:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Turtleneck Woolie [Locked DLC]
[2:36:55] <PhantomMaskJr> Chakra sweater larxaComfy
[2:36:55] <$Noponiz> because he is a blipster
[2:36:56] <EuropanLamprey> Oh god, I forgot Naruto is wearing a turtleneck
[2:36:56] <saiyan24675> spaghetti t101Big t101Oof
[2:36:56] <clack14> yeah he can sense peoples thingies.
[2:37:03] <Sol_Install> LUL
[2:37:04] <+UrielCobalt> Killer Bee was unfazed by sexy jutsu. Even the spoiler final villain was fazed by sexy jutsu.
[2:37:04] <+CoronetChris> He can sense the nine tails chakra from those two cloud ninjas
[2:37:09] <shameimarusen> CoolCat

[2:37:16] <its_sinny> Might Woolie?
[2:37:18] <+AmaranthSparrow> @masked_hero_lucky Rock Lee was the hard work character, not Naruto. Naruto had nine tails transforming from the very first arc.
[2:37:21] <harpsichord_uiy> Woolie confirmed Midoriya Izuku
[2:37:26] <+ggbhtg> He sense hatred in Kyubi Mode specifically, he didn't notice Kisame until then
[2:37:29] <niddron> Yo turtle necks are cool
[2:37:36] <saiyan24675> @UrielCobalt Cause Bee isn't into Traps
[2:37:37] <itesket> Turtle necks can be nice
[2:37:37] <%hitorio> @UrielCobalt turns out Naruto's Sexy Jutsu just wasn't Killer Bee's type; there are women who faze him later. Kappa
[2:37:39] <HolisticField> turtlenecks got popular around the mid 1800s when fear of vampires was at its height
[2:37:46] <%Afterman_> kisame deserved better BibleThump
[2:37:47] <%hitorio> Hopefully this game covers that
[2:37:52] <+DWexican> @UrielCobalt it was reverse sexy jutsu
[2:37:53] <cochramd1992> Naruto you naive buffooon
[2:37:55] <Zbyrd0961> chakra smash
[2:38:02] <Arblaster_> I feel a great disturbance in the chakra
[2:38:03] <Dragon_Batman> Also there is something unexplained in the game where he senses the brothers use the 9 tail chakra
[2:38:04] <itesket> Jesus
[2:38:06] <+Pompadourius> @hitorio Nah, that's the next game for sexy jutsu shenanigans
[2:38:12] <itesket> Thats just
[2:38:13] <katocrimson> adihash
[2:38:13] <+omenzazu> if the game wont cover it good woolie needs to see the anime
[2:38:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Minh poser DansGame
[2:38:18] <Arek_1> Oh...
[2:38:22] <aracon_> literally chakra sense
[2:38:26] <Ghost__Pantsu> The Minh lore increases
[2:38:37] <+arknodem> IN S E C R E T
[2:38:45] <%VidulaSaix> Yep
[2:38:47] <+Pompadourius> Nah, it's the next game that covers it rather than this one.
[2:38:48] <Jontman42> what the fuck is this tree dog with tentacles?
[2:38:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yeah I remember
[2:38:55] <%hitorio> @Pompadourius I particularly mean Killer Bee oriented - not Naruto's Sexy no Jutsu shenanigans.
[2:38:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> Naruto’s stupid you’ll be fine
[2:39:08] <+Deadbulky> The anime one is sick
[2:39:08] <+Pompadourius> @hitorio Ahhh. Maybe then.
[2:39:11] <Zebroneath> !uptime
[2:39:11] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 39 minutes
[2:39:17] <lotharrio> @Jontman42 It's an oxtopus.
[2:39:22] <+ggbhtg> basically
[2:39:25] <+AmaranthSparrow> Samehada likes chakra.
[2:39:25] <%hitorio> Bee honey-chakra'd the sword
[2:39:26] <Dragon_Batman> The sword never liked Kisame I think
[2:39:29] <+fatman19071> I still think this is my favourite anime
[2:39:29] <+NiSoKr> I think he just did some quick thinking
[2:39:37] <BlacSoul> O H W E L L
[2:39:56] <%hitorio> If the sword doesn't like you, it will stab your hands when you grab it
[2:39:59] <+Pompadourius> @Dragon_Batman It did like Kisame, but it literally has no other priorities other than whoever has the most chakra with a desire to use it.
[2:40:00] <Jontman42> @lotharrio thanks I hate it
[2:40:04] <+AmaranthSparrow> @dragon_batman It did, Kisame had a lot of chakra, but less than Bee.

[2:40:25] <%hitorio> Gai tried to pick up Samehada and the hilt grew spikes and shanked him
[2:40:27] <aracon_> the character designs got mad boring
[2:40:28] <+UrielCobalt> thats even truer with Bleach, all those black robes
[2:40:36] <HolisticField> its like the opposite of Berserk
[2:40:37] <aracon_> just so he could draw easier
[2:40:38] <itesket> the shounen jump grinder
[2:40:42] <+skyheys> BIG CLOAKS, BIG EMPTY SPACES WITH NO TEXTURE. That's his ninja way.
[2:40:42] <sphereshots12> This arc is pretty much what's happening right now
[2:40:44] <niddron> that's why they removed his goggles, itt easier tondraw
[2:40:49] <+UrielCobalt> Berserk also takes years to come out
[2:40:49] <Dragon_Batman> @Pompadourius @AmaranthSparrow ooh neat, but at the end of it it took a liking to Bee way more. any reasons?
[2:40:51] <%wolfofsound> just be like bleach and don't do background LUL
[2:40:52] <katocrimson> or be like kubo tite with no backgrounds
[2:40:54] <clack14> easy to draw my ninja way
[2:41:01] <%hitorio> Kishimoto drew Naruto with goggles in chapter 1 and was like "man fuck this shit"
[2:41:06] <%hitorio> Easy mode is now selectable
[2:41:13] <itesket> Rock lees weird green jumpsuit

[2:41:29] <NarcissistCactus> into the fog door
[2:41:29] <Dragon_Batman> or just stop
[2:41:36] <aracon_> nice
[2:41:37] <+ggbhtg> you don't hear me say
[2:41:37] <+Pompadourius> @Dragon_Batman I think it's just because they never ran into somebody with more chakra who also wanted to wield it. Like it'd love Naruto more than anyone else, but Naruto never wanted it so there'd be no point.
[2:41:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ok thats fair
[2:41:38] <%hitorio> yep
[2:41:38] <lotharrio> Mist door!
[2:41:40] <clack14> whoops white all the way
[2:41:40] <+ElementalX1000> He's out

[2:41:43] <niddron> let's see
[2:41:46] <shameimarusen> And hes still walking
[2:41:47] <+UrielCobalt> Then we got literal scribbles with HxH, though that Mangaka seems to be suffering from illness and mental instability.
[2:41:49] <lotharrio> He's fighting Cleric Beast as we speak.
[2:41:53] <Personified134> thats fine, its a portal
[2:41:54] <GoldeNOVA> He's going to the Dark Souls boss
[2:41:55] <niddron> fade
[2:41:57] <muniea3> *boss health bar appears*
[2:42:00] <Dragon_Batman> @Pompadourius That makes sense to me
[2:42:03] <+NiSoKr> If you wait a few hundred years will he show up behind you?

That's the best way to get those hero points and secret actions you missed.

[2:47:07] <+Pompadourius> I still agree with Plague where he said that without the Kyuubi and being born the son of the Hokage he'd just be Iruka.

[2:48:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @hitorio Perfect description
[2:48:57] <itesket> Maybe
[2:48:57] <AMstone776> because Iruka is Naruto's dad
[2:48:57] <EuropanLamprey> Ebisu did
[2:48:57] <ClairvoyantNara> yes
[2:48:58] <%VidulaSaix> He "tried"
[2:48:58] <Dragon_Batman> Cuz Iruka is essentially a dad to Naruto
[2:48:59] <cochramd1992> didn't win of course
[2:48:59] <%hitorio> I don't remember Iruka ever being in a fight
[2:49:01] <+Superbro64> yes
[2:49:02] <Sapphire_Breeze> he tried
[2:49:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS TIME
[2:49:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1201765677977231360?s=19

[2:49:08] <+GreenCMD> yes but he was rekt
[2:49:09] <+captain_history> he did and lost
[2:49:10] <thexiiilightning> Iruka fought the Death Clone, and Konohamaru finished him off
[2:49:10] <%JetpackMcQuack> SingsNote When I add notes SingsNote Nothing has to rhyme SingsNote
[2:49:11] <+Pompadourius> @AmaranthSparrow Sure. But in the case of DBZ the core theme isn't about hard work beating natural born talent.
[2:49:12] <+CarlosEoM> he JOBBED to a Pain clone
[2:49:13] <lotharrio> Kakashi had to save him.
[2:49:13] <Graxe_> Konohamaru also fought one of the Pains
[2:49:13] <Shishi1205> he lost to
[2:49:15] <+AmaranthSparrow> Iruka tried.
[2:49:17] <Zbyrd0961> he tried
[2:49:17] <Klefth> In japanese, it all actually sounds like bars. The dub just doesn't do it
[2:49:19] <+ggbhtg> LUL
[2:49:20] <niddron> well....he stood Infront of it
[2:49:21] <Arblaster_> Konohomaru saved Iruka from pain
[2:49:21] <%hitorio> Hey. Konohamaru bodied a Pain clone
[2:49:22] <Zbyrd0961> but only kinda
[2:49:23] <+Bluydee> is this it?
[2:49:28] <itesket> Dollar store naruto
[2:49:34] <+kyh9> @VidulaSaix I don't know about that. I mean when was the last time that Naruto and Iruka just spent time together? My impression was Jiraiya or Minato were more Naruto's father figure by this point in the story
[2:49:34] <+Arnschen> And the Sexy Jutsu
[2:49:35] <%Exiliator> and the sexy no jutsu
[2:49:41] <clack14> very sexy
[2:49:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:49:44] <+Grayhammatter> sexy no jutsu as well

[2:49:53] <saiyan24675> i summon Flipper
[2:49:54] <phatmac16> Iruka jobbed tho
[2:49:56] <+ggbhtg> May no Jutsu
[2:49:59] <%hitorio> Iruka's summon is probably a normal houseplant or some shit
[2:50:03] <%VidulaSaix> @kyh9 You dont have to always be with someone for them to be important to you
[2:50:03] <agadejobi> I don't know if I want to get back into Naruto or not
[2:50:04] <clack14> bite my hand it makes boobs
[2:50:11] <HollowMan190> y'all need stop dissing my man's
[2:50:12] <agadejobi> Because DB Super is not doing it for me
[2:50:14] <+AmaranthSparrow> Iruka 8s Japanese for "dolphin"
[2:50:14] <niddron> ooooooh man the sexy no jutsu, please for the live if God don't let him be spoiled
[2:50:17] <PhantomMaskJr> HahaLean
[2:50:18] <+paladinstarbuster> Iruka took a giant shuriken to the spine woolie
[2:50:20] <+ggbhtg> Doki DOKIIII
[2:50:22] <+greenfall> adult konohamaru is legit cool
[2:50:26] <agadejobi> Yeah, I'm mad that my boy Gohan is a jobber now
[2:50:27] <Jetsfantasy> Your bite got infected, you're going septic Kappa
[2:50:30] <+Taglog7> echo no jutsu
[2:50:30] <joylent_blue> whether or not you get back in to Naruto, Naruto will always be in you
[2:50:33] <Dragon_Batman> HIs job is to be a teacher
[2:50:34] <zamzoph> his job is babysitter
[2:50:35] <+UrielCobalt> Iruka is more of a big bro, he is too young to be his dad
[2:50:36] <%VidulaSaix> Hes a teacher
[2:50:37] <Jetsfantasy> He's a teacher first
[2:50:38] <Arek_1> Iruka refused to betray Naruto's location to one of Pain's paths and was saved by Kakashi.
[2:50:39] <AMstone776> no he is a teacher
[2:50:40] <calebhardman21> DAD no jutsu\
[2:50:40] <%JetpackMcQuack> Those who can't do, teach Kappa
[2:50:41] <%hitorio> Remember when timeskip Naruto told Iruka "I might even be stronger than you?" and Iruka's like "whoa bro don't get ahead of yourself"
[2:50:42] <ClairvoyantNara> he is a teacher
[2:50:43] <Kiraklene> He's a teavher
[2:50:43] <phatmac16> Hes a teacher
[2:50:45] <kikosmore> Teacher.
[2:50:46] <clack14> teacher to a nuke first.
[2:50:48] <BlacSoul> Teacher
[2:50:49] <xeros720> he went to father school instead of ninja school
[2:50:54] <clack14> ninja is his 5th job
[2:50:54] <+kyh9> @VidulaSaix Sure, but I don't think we even see Naruto THINK about Iruka. But Naruto DOES think about Sasuke, Jiraiya, and literally most of his other friends on a more regular basis than he does about Iruka.
[2:50:55] <xeros720> poor idea when you live in NINJA LAND
[2:50:56] <+AmaranthSparrow> Iruka is a chunin and a teacher, that's all.
[2:50:56] <+Pompadourius> Has Iruka even demonstrated a single jutsu of his own? Canon, not filler.
[2:50:57] <+fatman19071> spoiler but Iruka was narutos father at his wedding
[2:50:57] <Memitim> He's more of a cool uncle
[2:50:58] <Ether101_Prime> Typical elitism from Woolie.
[2:50:58] <Arblaster_> Iruka is still practicing the transformation jutsu
[2:50:59] <MayShip> a teacher that got drafted
[2:51:00] <joylent_blue> he's like an older brother more than anything
[2:51:01] <GoldeNOVA> Kakashi is also a teacher
[2:51:05] <+JacknZack27> He teaches elementary school woolie
[2:51:06] <+masked_hero_lucky> Not every ninja needs to have world ending magic
[2:51:06] <+Pompadourius> Iruka is just Tien tbh
[2:51:07] <HolisticField> you dont have to be a master to teach the basics to children
[2:51:12] <BlacSoul> hes Bad at it so he become a teacher
[2:51:12] <EuropanLamprey> No they didn't
[2:51:12] <+kyh9> @VidulaSaix I don't even remember Naruto interacting with Iruka that much after Naruto joined Kakashi's squad
[2:51:15] <%hitorio> Iruka was the one who got Naruto over his depression over Jiraiya's death, though
[2:51:16] <+CarlosEoM> Iruka teaches children tho
[2:51:17] <cochramd1992> no you dumbasses, this is not a time for infighting
[2:51:23] <Jetsfantasy> Good snake impression
[2:51:25] <kikosmore> I'm sure he escorted some cargo at some point. Some odd jobs here and there.
[2:51:25] <%Exiliator> Ill go myself! Now you two come with me! ?
[2:51:26] <+Taglog7> Those who can't teach, stream
[2:51:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus wow is this the FuckIruka crew?
[2:51:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH JUST YOU WAIT WOOLZ
[2:51:31] <HolisticField> teaching is a skill in itself

[2:59:06] <+kyh9> @UrielCobalt Sure, I saw that, but it still surprises me that over the time-skip, he only went up by two points from 24 to 26. Granted, Sakura is a 26 but he's not at the level of most other Jonin that we see. It feels kind of cheap imo to bring Iruka back up after he's been irrelevant for 99% of the series INCLUDING PRE-TIMESKIP
[2:59:07] <+skyheys> He basically is a big puppy
[2:59:09] <Shishi1205> Foxes do funny sounds

[2:59:18] <Jetsfantasy> Here we go
[2:59:20] <+Pompadourius> Giant animal creatures should ALWAYS talk with telepathy rather than open their mouths. It never looks good.
[2:59:20] <%hitorio> For the Kyubi to make "M" sounds, he would have to press his lips together.

[3:00:51] <+UrielCobalt> @kyh9 Iruka has always had high popularity in Japan, for slice of life reasons, and thats what his appearancedfocus on, character building, not any fight scenes. Weird I know and I would have wanted more but thats all Iruka is about at the end of the day.

[3:00:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GRANDMA
[3:00:59] <itesket> caise isnt she around 70 or something
[3:01:03] <%hitorio> @itesket No; Tsunade actually physically transforms her body to be younger. :D
[3:01:06] <clack14> hahah
[3:01:11] <Jetsfantasy> @itesket Those store the chakra she stores for her healing mark

[3:01:31] <%VidulaSaix> Minato wasn't even fast, he was just really good at using seals
[3:01:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH SHIT
[3:01:34] <itesket> I thought chakra was stored in the balls
[3:01:36] <Dragon_Batman> Raikage big strong big fast

[3:01:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WELP HES DEAD
[3:01:44] <guymontag0> Is that Raiden?
[3:01:45] <lotharrio> Jiraiya was just tossing around that title of savior every time he saw someone tough.

[3:01:48] <Sedrelic> literaly simpsons joke
[3:01:53] <cochramd1992> get dunked on Naruto
[3:01:53] <Potatoidea> Number overflow
[3:01:53] <NotHereToStream> yes shit on him Kappa
[3:01:54] <CozyGUNNA> chakra is stored in the clit
[3:01:55] <+Pompadourius> Thus begins the debate: does Minato count as being fast if he just teleports and it's not actual foot movement?
[3:01:55] <+Vikingdeath1> no no, dad's in my head, he's like a ghost or somethin'
[3:01:58] <%hitorio> Yeah; Minato wasn't even fast. He was just a teleporter and he pretended it was "speed" cause it sounded cooler
[3:01:59] <+Pompadourius> Thus the debate began in the fandom. lmao
[3:02:04] <phatmac16> Yo dad is a bitch
[3:02:07] <optimasmaximas> Yo dad a bitch!
[3:02:09] <kikosmore> Minato is whack honestly.

[3:02:26] <%Exiliator> Minato was the fastest what are you talking bout, even the first is like wow hes fast
[3:02:28] <Potatoidea> T
[3:02:28] <CozyGUNNA> 2nd hokage is the best hokage
[3:02:30] <333agus333> @Pompadourius I mean yea of course, if not, then Wesker shouldn't be considered fast either
[3:02:33] <%VidulaSaix> No, it ends at a point
[3:02:33] <clack14> T to pay respect
[3:02:35] <harpsichord_uiy> "yo you dont know my dad because you haven't talked to any ghosts"
[3:02:37] <%hitorio> I thought every moment with Minato was badass and solid gold until later manga ruined it
[3:02:39] <%VidulaSaix> Then 4 finishes it
[3:02:41] <lotharrio> Kishimoto's writing: Strongest guy in the village is called A. Second strongest is called B. This third strongest... I'll call them C.
[3:02:42] <+UrielCobalt> Minato is using shortcuts. Naruto perfects the formula
[3:02:44] <+AmaranthSparrow> @tossuda not quite
[3:02:45] <DSD24> This looks bad

[3:03:01] <+Pompadourius> @333agus333 I mean, I do agree of course. It's just that some don't.
[3:03:02] <%hitorio> Is C even the third strongest? I thought Darui was stronger than C
[3:03:05] <Dragon_Batman> This game should have a non ending cuz it came out before the manga finished yea?

I'd be down for Iruka showing up more just to be Naruto's emotional support network but he doesn't even do that that often. #LetNarutoPhoneCallIruka

[3:11:01] <%hitorio> @underFreddy I like how this implies that it's so obvious everyone in the village should've known, so he shouldn't have been persecuted
[3:11:01] <+Pompadourius> Ryu is stronger than Ken, but Ken has more to life than just fighting in a gi so I think he wins overall.

[3:14:58] <Monkeyweed21> the safe word is FLAME CONTROL BLACK SCORPION SHOW
[3:15:01] <dero45> Slug going up your ass

[3:15:19] <%yeknomlive> I just came in. wtf
[3:15:19] <underFreddy> Aren't you playing as an awakened character all the time, makes it a bit easier
[3:15:20] <+omenzazu> the slug was just there to share chakra
[3:15:25] <%hitorio> Karin has a bite mark on her body for everyone who's ever bitten her. :/
[3:15:31] <+ggbhtg> A tier at the least
[3:15:32] <%JetpackMcQuack> butt slugs
[3:15:36] <%This_is_Marco> shouldnt raikage be missing an arm?
[3:15:37] <ZuzuSuya> Trailer shot!

[3:16:14] <+kyh9> Naruto has now activated MAIN CHARACTER POWERS
[3:16:18] <PunishedMercer_> usain boruto
[3:16:19] <Morning_Asakura> YELLOW FLASH BABY
[3:16:19] <%VidulaSaix> Minato literally wasnt fast. He was just good at abusing seals
[3:16:22] <lotharrio> Minato's speed was teleport based though.
[3:16:23] <Arblaster_> Woolie he just ran quickly
[3:16:25] <DSD24> I done handcuffed lightning!
[3:16:27] <+chadaman99> Naruto doesn't know meaning sealing techniques.
[3:16:29] <+GreenCMD> just fast
[3:16:29] <+skyheys> Thematic fast movement
[3:16:30] <OldManDeckardCain> Tsunade about to wear her cougar shirt and go on prowl LUL
[3:16:30] <+Arnschen> Really fast
[3:16:31] <Ner234> JUST REALLY FAST
[3:16:31] <xxxJahrio> no
[3:16:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Basically

[3:16:34] <Frostydough1> no
[3:16:35] <%jake_protagonist> AS Fast WITHOUT the technique
[3:16:35] <Shishi1205> fast
[3:16:35] <%JetpackMcQuack> no
[3:16:35] <%VidulaSaix> No
[3:16:36] <Personified134> no
[3:16:36] <+Deadbulky> Minato was litterally warping
[3:16:36] <lotharrio> Naruto isn't using the same technique.
[3:16:37] <+killogram123> no just fast
[3:16:37] <underFreddy> @Pompadourius ah fair. Thought there was both an "awakening to chakra mode" and "chakra mode always" Naruto in this one.
[3:16:38] <dero45> FTL
[3:16:38] <+ElementalX1000> He was soooo faast
[3:16:38] <%jimmytwofeet> YES DUMBASS
[3:16:38] <+dredgyboi> just fast not instant transmission
[3:16:39] <+Pompadourius> It was a symbolic yellow flash.
[3:16:40] <phatmac16> No
[3:16:41] <Dragon_Batman> Just fast, Yellow flash is teleportation
[3:16:42] <+omenzazu> it's the orange something I forgot
[3:16:42] <plasmapuncher13> Really fast
[3:16:42] <+chadaman99> He has yellow chakra
[3:16:42] <Zbyrd0961> he's that fast
[3:16:42] <MyNameIsRasus> no
[3:16:43] <RpgFoLife> Orange flash but never again
[3:16:44] <+thegamekirby98> It's not the yellow flash, just op chakra movement
[3:16:46] <kikosmore> Minato cheats.
[3:16:47] <Ianrazz> Woolie he can run quickly like Sonic
[3:16:51] <+JacknZack27> Really fast. His dad was teleporting
[3:16:51] <%hitorio> Minato's just teleporting. Naruto's literally the fastest ninja in the world right now
[3:16:51] <MyNameIsRasus> hes just fast
[3:16:52] <+Bluydee> Minato teleports
[3:16:53] <%jake_protagonist> No that was a manga moment too
[3:16:54] <+UrielCobalt> ITs nota blood line technique, Minato got the move from studying the sealing jutsu of the Uxumaki, in fact
[3:16:55] <+Superbro64> top tier in nuns is danzo
[3:16:58] <dekkitout> Both, it's both
[3:16:59] <Arek_1> Feat of speed.
[3:17:01] <Zbyrd0961> he's as fast
[3:17:02] <harpsichord_uiy> man i miss cyberconnect games

[3:17:09] <+kyh9> OH THEY FUCKING
[3:17:11] <Monkeyweed21> Tenten is ACTUALLY top tier
[3:17:12] <GoldeNOVA> He's gonna use this power to evade Sakura
[3:17:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:17:13] <lotharrio> Naruto is fast in the sense of actual speed. Minato is a teleporter who is also pretty quick besides.
[3:17:15] <BreakersAweigh> he's as fast as minato teleporting
[3:17:15] <%hitorio> Man, remember when Sasuke was speedblitzing Naruto
[3:17:16] <+Pompadourius> @underFreddy Yeah. In this you have chakra mode as a regular character, and then chakra mode with the coat as his awakened form.
[3:17:16] <+Deadbulky> STORM 4 HY[E

[3:17:33] <+chadaman99> It's not Storm 4 yet
[3:17:33] <Klefth> Minato teleports. Naruto is just dumb fast. Also that was in the manga, so not just a cyberconnect moment
[3:17:34] <Malikwest11> one more pore is
[3:17:34] <AMstone776> NUNS4 is not yet.

[3:17:54] <funnylittlecheeseboy> Filler hounds
[3:17:55] <+kyh9> NUNS4 already? The one with the BEST FIGHT IN THE SERIES
[3:18:00] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's that each side has 100,000 and each side lost half
[3:18:02] <+omenzazu> he uses them in the zabuza fight
[3:18:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WE HAVENT SEEN THE BIG BIG MONEY FINAL FIGHT
[3:18:03] <+Pompadourius> NUNS4 ain't here yet my dudes
[3:18:03] <CozyGUNNA> omg
[3:18:04] <lotharrio> You want to talk about forgotten summons? Gai's turtle.
[3:18:04] <ClairvoyantNara> He did this session Woolie
[3:18:05] <Glitched_Shinobi> Konohamaru uses it in boruto
[3:18:06] <guymontag0> Dogs have a short lifespan
[3:18:08] <gunsrlove> Everytime they say Ninja , it's the like the Asian N-word, that some asians use for fun
[3:18:10] <eddi401> They've been using the dogs nonstop
[3:18:11] <+omenzazu> you just missed the secret factor
[3:18:16] <sangi53> two suns? Are we in mgs?
[3:18:21] <aracon_> I think we're at the last chapter now
[3:18:23] <EuropanLamprey> Woolie, the word you're looking for is "Powercreep"
[3:18:24] <@Solidus_113> no
[3:18:24] <DSD24> Liquid Sun
[3:18:29] <@Solidus_113> this isn't last chapter
[3:18:30] <+ggbhtg> @omenzazu shaddup LUL
[3:18:31] <BlacSoul> he used pakkun as a scout
[3:18:32] <HolisticField> i dont want dogs to fight :(
[3:18:33] <aracon_> ah okay
[3:18:38] <lotharrio> One of two directions. Enhance your strengths, or cover your weaknesses.
[3:18:38] <cochramd1992> what do you even lose by making a pact with these ninja animals?
[3:18:42] <AMstone776> the next one is the last chapter
[3:18:43] <grimzanarky> enma died with the third i think
[3:18:45] <+omenzazu> @ggbhtg no
[3:18:46] <%hitorio> Remember when 2nd Hokage did a water wall with no water around and that ANBU shit himself? Then Darui did the same shit
[3:18:46] <DCMurderverse> i was about to ask, isnt that the MGS4 font
[3:18:47] <%JetpackMcQuack> Cover Kakashi's poor sense of smell
[3:18:48] <Shishi1205> he has turtles
[3:18:48] <+UrielCobalt> Rock Lee would need to know ninjutsu
[3:18:50] <+Pompadourius> Lee can't use chakra to summon though.
[3:18:51] <BreakersAweigh> rock lee can't use chakra lol
[3:18:53] <+kyh9> Rock Lee can't do fucking summoning jutsu tho
[3:18:53] <Monkeyweed21> the genjutsu animal is the clam
[3:18:54] <+LordAlexGram> Kakashi is mid tier at best but that u Hoya eye is a teir
[3:18:54] <+CarlosEoM> he cant summon tho
[3:18:55] <CozyGUNNA> enma didnt die
[3:18:55] <+JacknZack27> So is this where the filler starts?
[3:18:55] <Baron_VonCookies> Rock Lee should make a deal with the Slug
[3:18:56] <+dredgyboi> but to summon the owl requires chakra abilities
[3:18:56] <joylent_blue> but he can't do chakra tho
[3:18:57] <cochramd1992> you summon them whenever you want, and they can't summon you
[3:19:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Jinjuriki Lee would be sick
[3:19:01] <+chadaman99> Lee can't use ninjutsu
[3:19:04] <Jetsfantasy> The turtle serves as a double jump
[3:19:05] <lotharrio> @cochramd1992 Presumably, they'll ask for favors the same way you ask them for favors.
[3:19:09] <+Pompadourius> @JacknZack27 Non-canon ending begins now, yeah.
[3:19:12] <+kyh9> Might Guy does sort of, with the turtle
[3:19:15] <+AWr00tBear> Or a Clam lol
[3:19:22] <muniea3> Lee is disabled
[3:19:25] <lotharrio> Gai's summon is a turtle. I guess he uses it as a weapon?
[3:19:26] <Daxalog> Woolie to be real Lee would just teach the animal/spirit to not be so reliant on illusions and become a pupil of his.
[3:19:27] <+paladinstarbuster> If lee could do shadow clones on the level of naruto nobody could beat him
[3:19:29] <EuropanLamprey> Lee wouldn't be able to summon the animal though
[3:19:30] <%hitorio> Rock Lee is so sick he summons himself into the manga's dopest fights
[3:19:31] <joylent_blue> chakra disabled
[3:19:32] <Monkeyweed21> The genjutsu animal is a clam
[3:19:33] <AMstone776> Might Guy don't need that bullshit
[3:19:34] <Arek_1> Man that turtle was forgettable.
[3:19:37] <+kyh9> The fucking
[3:19:38] <WanderingSwordsman> how canon is this last chapter?
[3:19:41] <+UrielCobalt> Guy can use Ninjutsu, unlike Lee, he just prefers taijutsu, because of spoilers later
[3:19:43] <GoldeNOVA> @muniea3 shhh
[3:19:43] <+kyh9> Not at all
[3:19:44] <RpgFoLife> Summoning isnt ninjustu
[3:19:46] <cochramd1992> @muniea3 and yet he almost bodied Gaara
[3:19:46] <biomegabear> Im surprised people would give a shit about tsunade doujins
[3:19:47] <+ElementalX1000> Not canon
[3:19:47] <+skyheys> Next fight's hype
[3:19:53] <%hitorio> Hey, it's Mabui - the secretary people want to bang
[3:19:58] <%hitorio> @biomegabear why's that?
[3:20:02] <sangi53> @biomegabear are you crazy?
[3:20:02] <+UrielCobalt> Summoning is ninjutsu
[3:20:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Raikage is super Tsun
[3:20:03] <+kyh9> Summoning clearly is the same general type of chakra-management that Gai and Lee are bad at
[3:20:03] <+ggbhtg> there's still SOME canon stuff yall
[3:20:04] <+Pompadourius> @WanderingSwordsman Not at all. Like the fight has the same characters involved, but it's not the same.
[3:20:05] <reiju_22> mabui Kreygasm
[3:20:06] <Floridamangentlyweepsact3> slight spoiler but guy doesnt need that hes pratically one of the strongest ninjas
[3:20:09] <PunishedMercer_> who doesn't wanna bang the secretary
[3:20:11] <CozyGUNNA> is this the kage fight
[3:20:12] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> finallly, filler, that means the story is about to get good
[3:20:13] <Monkeyweed21> WHERE'S CHOJIS WIFE
[3:20:14] <lotharrio> Alright fine. I guess your giant thundercock is bigger than mine.
[3:20:16] <cochramd1992> @biomegabear why not? who can resist huge-titted GILF who still looks young?
[3:20:16] <Memitim> Most of this is non-canon I think?
[3:20:28] <itesket> Chakra bluetooth
[3:20:30] <+ggbhtg> theres still some canon left
[3:20:31] <biomegabear> @hitorio @cochramd1992 not my first thought
[3:20:32] <+kyh9> @cochramd1992 The ultimate in MILF technology
[3:20:33] <AMstone776> all of it besides the ending.
[3:20:35] <wendigo172> @monkeyweed21 not in the game
[3:20:36] <harpsichord_uiy> "and then he told them"
[3:20:38] <%hitorio> Konoha is OD at war strategy because they have the Yamanakas

[3:22:47] <biomegabear> @cochramd1992 To be fair anyone around this area beyond 24 just looks like a monster old dead person
[3:22:48] <foiledyetagain> someone translate white hair into fighting game terms, he might get it Kappa
[3:22:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYE

[3:23:00] <+LordAlexGram> Kakashi

[3:23:02] <%hitorio> Naruto demonstrates why he is the MVP
[3:23:02] <CaptainTenshou> its suigetsu Kappa
[3:23:03] <+blackmatrix3> Who’s hair turned white?
[3:23:03] <cochramd1992> @hitorio or she let herself be gangbanged all the time to pay off gambling debts

[3:23:08] <Shishi1205> cho odama

[3:23:18] <%gatorafan> Wait are we doing this?
[3:23:18] <thexiiilightning> It's Jiraya
[3:23:22] <%hitorio> @cochramd1992 That's potentially depressing. :P
[3:23:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BET THE FUTURE
[3:23:25] <%gatorafan> Right now? Fight of the Kage?
[3:23:29] <muniea3> absolutely
[3:23:30] <%VidulaSaix> Nah he's probably about to stop
[3:23:32] <%jake_protagonist> Yes you could tack
[3:23:34] <MyNameIsRasus> he can stack
[3:23:35] <%VidulaSaix> Though I hope he keeps going
[3:23:35] <Arblaster_> It's obviously Sai and Jiraya
[3:23:37] <+Pompadourius> @gatorafan Nah. :(
[3:23:37] <%gatorafan> I almost feel like we should leave it for next week
[3:23:37] <dekkitout> Yes he can stack
[3:23:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @gatorafan SOON. ITS THE COOLEST
[3:23:41] <cochramd1992> @hitorio not if she enjoyed it Kappa
[3:23:41] <+killogram123> you can stack
[3:23:43] <Dragon_Batman> Was gonna act like eh who knows

[3:23:49] <OldManDeckardCain> boy can this boy stack
[3:23:51] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus he wont stack Sage jutsu with anything
[3:23:52] <mr_leon283> He cannot stack right now
[3:23:55] <Dragon_Batman> but if people just gonna say it
[3:23:56] <+UrielCobalt> You get an answer for that later on whether he can stack
[3:24:02] <jbees7> he can't sage and kyubi mode at the same time
[3:24:06] <+Superbro64> CmonBruh black haired person
[3:24:06] <Jetsfantasy> He looks injured. or disabled. there's a hint
[3:24:08] <%hitorio> Okay; I'll spill the beans. It's Xehanort
[3:24:11] <RICE02> cmonBruh
[3:24:12] <lotharrio> Sasuke gets random bullshit super powers that come together into a solid powerset. Naruto has a weak powerset, but just stacks buffs endlessly.

[3:35:41] <+Superbro64> im excited for our new overlords in a post coppa youtube world
[3:35:54] <Dragon_Batman> Yea the fact that you got 3 games that take up alot of time hurt
[3:36:01] <+Pompadourius> Once coppa comes let's all jump ship to Pornhub :D
[3:36:04] <Arek_1> I'm curious how this culture of false claims came to be.
[3:36:05] <clack14> maybe go dumber?
[3:36:09] <+Superbro64> please be excited for 75% of the sites legacy content to be just deleted. All gone

[3:36:30] <+Mekhet09> Rip the Super best friends channel.
[3:36:40] <+Taglog7> There's an animated character. This shit's for kids.
[3:36:41] <+Pompadourius> I hate Dailymotion though tbh... and neither of them have a layout as good looking as Youtube. But it'll be how it be in the end.
[3:36:53] <+ggbhtg> @arek_1 we've GOT to have MONEY
[3:36:58] <+omenzazu> also no money to be made there
[3:37:02] <+UrielCobalt> you could always do body art to fill the gap. Kappa
[3:37:11] <%lordsdb> someone got a bunch there eps on vimeo i think @Mekhet09
[3:37:12] <clack14> or sell underwear
[3:37:19] <+Manderson1998> @woolieversus you can do the hero sides and extra fights if you want to milk this game more
[3:37:28] <+Pompadourius> Yo, those keyboards are banging.

[3:40:38] <$Louie_Salmon> Somehow in my brain I imagined it would be way bigger

[3:41:34] <RICE02> What
[3:41:36] <MonstarGrrrl> mute ?
[3:41:38] <%UrielCobalt> depends on the kind of popcorn
[3:41:38] <%hitorio> Movie theater pop corn is delicious
[3:41:39] <+6PoundsofShrimp> I love popcorn
[3:41:41] <%VidulaSaix> Woolie you hate sustenance LUL
[3:41:42] <lotharrio> Hate is for breakfast

[3:41:48] <Jetsfantasy> Get in the popcorn cup, Shinji
[3:41:51] <Shishi1205> EAT IT FROM THE GROUND
[3:41:51] <0rond> it's hard to be less elaborate than popcorn
[3:41:52] <CrimsonCore90> Popcorn sucks unless it's cheesy
[3:42:00] <Klefth> Fuck popcorn. IT HAS NO TASTE.
[3:42:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Buy for the bucket
[3:42:03] <@Menitta> popcorn is only as good as the toppings
[3:42:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> NO TASTE WOOLIE
[3:42:18] <zamzoph> remember when Woolie was going to talk about Escaflowne?
[3:42:19] <Dragon_Batman> So escaflowne?

[3:42:47] <joylent_blue> DXLelouch24 yeah they finished the session
[3:42:48] <+arknodem> Isn't it that mecha show with dragon hearts and shit?
[3:42:49] <Chatterbox1991> Cheese Popcprn is Mana from the Gods
[3:42:50] <@Solidus_113> Popcorn is the rice of the snack world
[3:42:51] <%hitorio> I guess I'm a basic bitch for being delighted by popcorn with butter
[3:42:54] <+arknodem> I vaguely remember it.
[3:42:58] <Dragon_Batman> Nacho chips with cheese is where it's at
[3:42:58] <MattDemers> Nibs at the movie theatre is top tier
[3:42:58] <@Menitta> Put Kraft mac and cheese powder on it. that shit is delicious
[3:43:04] <lotharrio> Toriko would be sad
[3:43:16] <%hitorio> I hear Toriko is hype and badass. Should read it
[3:43:18] <reiju_22> @DXLelouch24 street fighter 4 later
[3:43:27] <Klefth> Popcorn is the most bland thing ever. Bland texture. No taste. It's trash.
[3:43:27] <+Manderson1998> I eat jalapenos on popcorn
[3:43:30] <lotharrio> Piece of bread, toasted, butter. Solid.
[3:43:32] <+Taglog7> "I've got some yellow liquid for your popcorn,."
[3:43:36] <EndgameContent> Show them the opening, Woolie!
[3:43:39] <+omenzazu> toriko is good till you get to the rushed endgame
[3:43:39] <+ggbhtg> can you have cereal on keto?
[3:43:41] <0rond> @woolieversus opinions on popcorn for breakfast?
[3:43:41] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus It's also isekai
[3:43:41] <%UrielCobalt> @Solidus_113 that's crackers, because like rice they can go with many things for improvement
[3:43:45] <lotharrio> Isekai
[3:43:52] <biomegabear> isekai
[3:43:53] <+aishman> It's an ISEKAAAAI
[3:43:54] <MattDemers> @ggbhtg No, not usually (am on keto atm)
[3:43:56] <joylent_blue> ohhhhhhhhh
[3:43:57] <Graxe_> Fantasy mecha
[3:44:00] <+spodebroker> Is he talking about Escaflowne?
[3:44:02] <Graxe_> Yes
[3:44:03] <%alrobot2014> yep
[3:44:04] <joylent_blue> that sounds awesome
[3:44:05] <saiyan24675> so it's an Isekai with Mechas
[3:44:14] <%UrielCobalt> IT was Inuyasha before Inuyasha
[3:44:14] <+Taglog7> Boyfriend Bots
[3:44:15] <%hitorio> I'm curious to see this concept
[3:44:17] <+HawkGoggles2> Its' mecha inuyasha. replace demons with robots and Japan with Europe
[3:44:17] <+captain_history> and a dope OST
[3:44:18] <Klefth> And they have terrible names
[3:44:27] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[3:44:29] <+ggbhtg> she was TRANSported to a faraway land? @woolieversus
[3:44:30] <0rond> wait wait wait can you repeat the dragons part?
[3:44:31] <zamzoph> RUINED
[3:44:32] <CrimsonCore90> Boyfriend Beaten up
[3:44:33] <%ozzrabbit> Escaflone was an Isekai before Sword Art Online.
[3:44:35] <+Pompadourius> Fucked it
[3:44:36] <lotharrio> 40 minute setup to a wet fart.
[3:44:37] <Camail> balls lost
[3:44:40] <%hitorio> Inuyasha might be the most repetitively-formulaic manga I have ever read in my life
[3:44:41] <+Leon_Spencer> the toriko manga ended well
[3:44:42] <xdeathknightx> you fucked up you fucked up!
[3:44:43] <zamzoph> the robots aren't that big
[3:44:46] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus you could have just pulled up the intro in all that time
[3:44:47] <stranger59> Show is completely insane by the end, with the villains actively attacking character's relationships.
[3:44:48] <+Pompadourius> @ozzrabbit ???
[3:44:55] <Arek_1> Wow, cool... you brought a box. LUL
[3:45:00] <%UrielCobalt> Sword Art Online never pretended to be original, its based on .hack fanfiction
[3:45:04] <+omenzazu> @leon_spencer ehhhh that is debatable
[3:45:05] <Chatterbox1991> ...should i rerwatch escaflone
[3:45:12] <%hitorio> That recoil and bang sounds like how Mitsuo Iso animated Asuka's last stand in End of Evangelion
[3:45:18] <Chatterbox1991> cus woolie is selliing me
[3:45:26] <lotharrio> Plus the mecha in Escaflowne operate like giant exoskeleton armor.
[3:45:28] <+Taglog7> Ehhh, have it in the Background
[3:45:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1201765677977231360?s=19
[3:45:31] <zamzoph> didn't it turn out that Issac Newton is the emperor of the evil empire or something?
[3:45:35] <+FadingFrost> what the name I missed it
[3:45:35] <+Leon_Spencer> i got what i wanted out of it anyway
[3:45:37] <+Pompadourius> Tbh, .hack is where the real good shit is
[3:45:38] <%ozzrabbit> @pompadourius it’s one of the original isekai series before it really took off. Every one forgets about Escaflone and .hack//sign
[3:45:42] <bevyrage> escaflowne is on a lot of peeps' annual rewatch lists
[3:45:53] <%UrielCobalt> Isaac Newton, that sounds fititng, the guy did dabble in some arcane shit
[3:45:54] <lotharrio> Movies are stand alone
[3:46:05] <+Pompadourius> @ozzrabbit Oh no, I just mean that .hack and SAO aren't isekai, they're a part of the MMO anime genre.
[3:46:05] <+ggbhtg> Escaflowne never hurt nobody
[3:46:12] <DatAsuna> So it's like ghost in the shell
[3:46:13] <lotharrio> The robots are the same
[3:46:14] <%hitorio> I remember .hack sign because it was the first time I saw a brown chick in anime
[3:46:17] <+Taglog7> Is there a Canadian rapper called EskaFlow?
[3:46:19] <DatAsuna> movie and show are their own universes
[3:46:22] <stranger59> All my friends who loved the show HATED the movie.
[3:46:36] <DatAsuna> speaking of which, watch arise woolie
[3:46:51] <+omenzazu> watch Vinland Saga
[3:46:52] <%ozzrabbit> @pompadourius yes, but it’s kinda a sub-genre of isekai because you’re still “transported to another world”.

[3:47:41] <%6PoundsofShrimp> oh lol I just wanted this emoji
[3:47:42] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus show them the OP and its super romance song
[3:47:49] <Shishi1205> Spriggan? do you say it like that?
[3:47:50] <Cecion> Yuki Kajiura no contest
[3:47:50] <+Superbro64> as someone who despises box mac and cheese, I agree
[3:48:01] <%6PoundsofShrimp> woolieS woolieT woolieF woolieU
[3:48:11] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> Argento Soma, that's where it's at
[3:48:25] <%UrielCobalt> Spriggan, that was a dope motion picture
[3:48:33] <Dragon_Batman> Ahh it's not Sprigand?
[3:48:34] <OldManDeckardCain> AKSHUELLLY
[3:48:35] <Shishi1205> just curious
[3:48:37] <lotharrio> It's an Irish word, I think.
[3:48:41] <Skeletonmanners> Spriggan is a real word tho
[3:48:41] <Kazuhira_Boat> Kara No Kyoukai got that Kajiura is it
[3:48:45] <+ggbhtg> Spu rig ann
[3:48:47] <phatmac16> I fought that thing in fgo
[3:48:47] <+Pompadourius> Spriggan is definitely a real world.
[3:48:48] <Shishi1205> its a type of elf or whatever
[3:48:49] <Cecion> totally a real word
[3:48:49] <+captain_history> but it's a real word
[3:48:50] <zamzoph> at least Woolie didn't say "turk-wise"
[3:48:50] <BlacSoul> Spriggan is a kind of fae
[3:48:52] <+Pompadourius> word*
[3:48:57] <%hitorio> Yoki Kajiura seduced me into Kara no Kyoukai
[3:48:59] <+omenzazu> dont you fight those spiragns in skyrim?
[3:49:00] <%hitorio> *Yuki
[3:49:04] <lotharrio> SprigKWANG
[3:49:12] <Arek_1> He said "DO you say it like that," not "WHY do you say it like that."
[3:49:12] <+paladinstarbuster> @phatmac16 yeah FGO
[3:49:13] <%UrielCobalt> Spriggan aren't really fae, they were more guardians of fae
[3:49:20] <+ggbhtg> how about those Spriggan 12, chat?
[3:49:21] <phatmac16> Kara no Kyoukai best ost
[3:49:22] <+AmaranthSparrow> I remember an uncut episode of Escaflowne airing on Fox Kids where a guy scratched his own cheek until it started bleeding.
[3:49:23] <+balouie> that makes me think of dominion tank police
[3:49:39] <%hitorio> Sword of the Stranger is another classic movie where I think the sakuga impact >> the overall movie impact
[3:49:44] <+omenzazu> >2asted
[3:49:51] <Graxe_> Rest up for SF4
[3:49:52] <+arknodem> Gonna try out that Broly?

[3:50:22] <zamzoph> @AmaranthSparrow I remember the main girl's shirt getting unbuttoned Kreygasm And then that was the last episode Fox aired
[3:50:30] <+bizzer10> aww i missed the full burst?
[3:50:34] <Arek_1> Red Focus and EX Red Focus.
[3:50:35] <Dragon_Batman> So we seeing Blanka?
[3:50:35] <Cecion> kinda looks like the dreds are crawling up the armrest to escape
[3:50:45] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Use OMEGA MODE COWARDS
[3:50:50] <+Pompadourius> @Cecion I see it
[3:50:52] <%hitorio> @Pompadourius Not sure, but I moreso meant "classic" in the sakuga sense. It's kind of Yutaka Nakamura's magnum opus and it's been 12 years since the movie released
[3:50:54] <phatmac16> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:50:57] <Graxe_> Bring back Vanilla Sagat

[3:51:48] <%UrielCobalt> whoops, confused Yashiro Nightow with Masamune Shirow
[3:51:49] <Arek_1> Crumple on level 1 EX Red Focus as opposed to crumple needing level 2 EX Focus.

[3:52:00] <+CarlosEoM> later Guys!
[3:52:07] <%hitorio> then Nakamura animated the first fight in Soul Eater episode 1 in 2008, which is my favorite sequence from him
[3:52:09] <Ozmodyas> Had to download the app to post this, but apparently Spriggan is actually pronounced “Spridgen”
