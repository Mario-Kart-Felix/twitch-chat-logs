[0:26:40] <@Menitta> Joker isnt that good tbh
[0:26:40] <GamecubesGiganticAButton> what does fgc stand for?
[0:26:42] <+mastermindgoblin> If u wanna show off the cool animations put meter on. If u want balanced matches don’t. Argument over.

[0:26:48] <majesticpaladin> Yeah Roy as well
[0:26:53] <worldbrand> @queaks holy shit
[0:26:54] <fireking900> Would have it been fine if the weak chars had good FSs?
[0:26:54] <DropFireGemini> The only way this game could be balanced is putting all the brokeness in a different part of the game
[0:27:00] <manstertruck> marth kills at 0
[0:27:00] <RadShiro> if the FS were all balanced, it would be hype
[0:27:04] <ihateyouo> zelda FS

[0:27:36] <%jinking79> luigi
[0:27:37] <%wujak> another big problem is the meter charges over time, so you dont even need to fight to gain it. you can just run away and stall

[0:31:34] <%Solidnick18> explain smash man
[0:31:36] <+Vorga1339> smash stages are a controlled substance
[0:31:37] <worldbrand> they should actually just use a dart board
[0:31:38] <+Aerobatics1> i mean its not like a smash player wouldnt body people on all these stages, they just dont like random shit hitting them for no reason
[0:31:39] <DragonSpooker> We can Battlefield any stage......right
[0:31:39] <$megamonmon123> this is literally region locked fun
[0:31:39] <+TruSanKyuu> That stage screws with Palutena's recovery DansGame
[0:31:40] <KumaTorey> sucks theres so many stages that have just ONE factor that makes it a problem FailFish one hazard or One decision but sakurai just couldnt do it. even with hazardless it Had to not work
[0:31:40] <@akuda_bar> explain mr smash expert
[0:31:41] <LucasOIntoxicado> i almost feel bad for Sakurai
[0:31:41] <manstertruck> @fireking900 you can use those also. This is just the non-omega versions you can also play
[0:31:43] <+razielhex> gamers ruin everything
[0:31:44] <+mastermindgoblin> I play like this myself, I just want to see woolie play with dumb bullshit on

[0:31:53] <thebiganxiety> Competitive smash is a fucking joke
[0:31:57] <Predatorhahaha23000> oof
[0:31:57] <%Knoxx_Gold> The tournament was too fun
[0:31:59] <ShawnEXE> @Solidus_113 FD and Battlefield mode is allowed but the only issue is copyrighted music
[0:31:59] <%miniaturechub> Bro you guys are right great cave should be legal
[0:32:06] <Papa_Bearman> THIS! THIS is why I don't like competitive culture. This anti-fun shit right here!
[0:32:11] <Papa_Bearman> Fun is a failure of the game designers!
[0:32:11] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Smash players gotta come and ruin it for everybody Kappa
[0:32:12] <squirtkitten> @thebiganxiety It's big party game pros being angry about party game mechanics

[0:32:15] <+FadingEmber> Cowards
[0:32:19] <FenixSeraph> Troll Snake
[0:32:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Doesn't BF mode make all stages functionally the same?
[0:32:20] <$FuqBoiSlim> Legalize Fourside
[0:32:22] <@Solidus_113> HOLD ON
[0:32:23] <AncelDeLambert> Only Fox, Final Destination
[0:32:24] <squirtkitten> Whens mario party at EVO?
[0:32:25] <FlameLoneWolf> And this is why competitive Smash sucks shit.

[0:32:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> RUFUS??
[0:32:29] <LegendaryDorkKnight> 85m only
[0:32:30] <@Solidus_113> WHY IS FOUNTAIN OF DREAMS BANNED? @WoolieVersus

[0:32:45] <Predatorhahaha23000> wheres pat to explain why smash sucks
[0:32:47] <Ace_Clef> "You dont see the C." AINT THAT THE FUCKIN POINT?
[0:32:49] <@Solidus_113> this stream is the worst
[0:32:50] <+tire_marqs> play the fucking game
[0:32:51] <+mastermindgoblin> @woolieversus could we have a dumb bullshit match or two later on maybe?
[0:32:51] <manstertruck> @Solidus_113 it causes frame drops and also isn't different to battlefield with hazards off
[0:32:52] <thebiganxiety> @squirtkitten Pretty much. Reason why melee players arent taken seriously.
[0:32:52] <@Solidus_113> I hate all of this
[0:32:57] <%Cobra743> Thus half the characters are shit
[0:32:57] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Were my Cloud Strife mains at?
[0:32:58] <SchroedingersFerret> Fountain is banned because of the mirror effect
[0:32:58] <@Menitta> And Green Greens 64
[0:32:59] <KumaTorey> Midgar is just BF reskinned
[0:33:00] <%Solidnick18> New donk

[0:33:03] <+TheRealOlag> F I N A L D
[0:33:06] <%MichaelDood> This is the most important stream of all.
[0:33:08] <%GohanEgret> @Predatorhahaha23000 he doesn't say that, he says the drama around smash sucks
[0:33:09] <MikanDaiGurren> Is Dreamland 64 really not legal what?
[0:33:11] <InXplotch> Clock tower's biggest problem is the background
[0:33:11] <+GreatMonorail> clock tower is trash
[0:33:13] <majesticpaladin> @solidus_113 You hate ANTI- FUN?? DendiFace
[0:33:13] <@Commando_Joe> and that's why you'll never be a pro @Solidus_113
[0:33:15] <InXplotch> it's so fucking busy
[0:33:15] <@Menitta> it had walls
[0:33:20] <%Aitch971> that stage gives me motion sickness
[0:33:25] <SuckPuppet> it's like trying to add extra rules to Candy Land
[0:33:26] <Spirit_NB> @Solidus_113 It lags real bad. framedrops when you hold shield IIRC
[0:33:33] <Ace_Clef> Moving platforms are too fun.
[0:33:36] <%jinking79> mite as well add a Crab stage ppl will love that
[0:33:37] <Predatorhahaha23000> @gohanegret fair.
[0:33:37] <squirtkitten> @thebiganxiety I lost all respect when they started having to use asolutely broken gamecube controllers just to play the game their way
[0:33:38] <theshadowproducer> what we doing tonight
[0:33:39] <+GreatMonorail> you and your bayo love, just play clock tower and you will know why.
[0:33:43] <+FadingEmber> ITS NOT BROKEN THE WAY I LIKE IT
[0:33:44] <Papa_Bearman> This is literally the most ridiculous shit I've seen today.
[0:33:47] <+Vorga1339> LEGALIZE CLOCKTOWER IT'S NATURAL
[0:33:51] <ThePixelMan421> The copyright music and square Enix’s inconsistency gets Midgar banned probably.
[0:33:52] <$FuqBoiSlim> fuck kalos EleGiggle EleGiggle EleGiggle
[0:33:53] <FlameLoneWolf> Movement = Fun = Not allowed
[0:35:07] <Bladeexe> Its like turning a party game into a competitive fighter is dumb and boring.
[0:35:08] <%able_beard> It's like ordering a burger to only eat the cheese
[0:35:11] <TaylorTot> Am i in a dream?
[0:35:13] <theshadowproducer> task is victory
[0:35:13] <+mastermindgoblin> How about we just ban all the stages?
[0:35:16] <Predatorhahaha23000> what 5 bf are banned?!

[0:35:27] <+Deadpool2450> no stages with water only stinks allowed
[0:35:27] <%Solidnick18> alright
[0:35:27] <@Menitta> @Aerobatics1 But thats the case with every stage and thats why stage picks are so frustrating
[0:35:29] <DynamicMenace_> pat was right
[0:35:29] <+FadingEmber> .... they banned a BF
[0:35:33] <+Mushinronja> Imagine a stage in SFV that had a whole in the center that you had to jump over
[0:35:34] <@Menitta> Its NEVER an even playing field
[0:35:36] <Predatorhahaha23000> remind ne what pat said
[0:35:36] <+ShikiYakumo> Lolcompetativesmash

[0:35:55] <+mastermindgoblin> Pat just started sneezing like crazy and he doesn’t know why.
[0:35:57] <Dumple_Roe> @fadingember they banned the standard stage?!
[0:36:03] <%able_beard> Smash is the greatest trash game. It's true.
[0:36:04] <@Commando_Joe> This all makes sense when thousands of dollars are on the line
[0:36:06] <theshadowproducer> WAIT PAT IS RIGHT?
[0:36:06] <Ace_Clef> LegalizePilotwings
[0:36:10] <KumaTorey> a Pat can be right twice a day Kappa

[0:36:16] <$FuqBoiSlim> Remember chat: Pat Is ALWAYS Right EleGiggle
[0:36:18] <@Commando_Joe> Pat is right if you're not making money off this
[0:36:20] <FlameLoneWolf> Pat was so fucking right, fuck competitive Smash
[0:36:21] <SuckPuppet> @Mushinronja good thing SF doesn't need to be fucked with for decades just to be a tourney game
[0:36:25] <%Cobra743> Glitchy recoveries, unreliable teleports, and piss babies cheating with broken controllers......does the SMASH community REALIZE how stupid this sounds when talking about a party game?
[0:36:27] <+cvp5127> wasnt omega mode supposed to solve this?
[0:36:29] <+mastermindgoblin> Pat was right, the end times are here.
[0:36:30] <+GreatMonorail> you shouldn't feel bad for Pat, he's still just being a jerk
[0:36:32] <TomCrimson> you guys didnt know about this insanity and you were yelling at Pat like HE was crazy? shame chat.
[0:36:34] <+sabertoothzombie> Pat is right about what?
[0:36:37] <@Menitta> My stance on this is actually the extreme in the opposite direction ironically
[0:36:37] <%GinAndRoses> mh9s subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Woolie's home banned from Smash
[0:36:37] <majesticpaladin> Crazy talk made competitive Smash trash
[0:36:43] <@Menitta> Dick stages are ALWAYS legal

[0:37:20] <TheBrunoZone> So, Dick Stages are prohibited. Lame....

[0:37:35] <Predatorhahaha23000> buff little mac not ban a stage
[0:37:35] <+monkeyhous3> hoe embarrassing for Mac
[0:37:40] <+myhandsareblank> I play Little Mac and no one has ever once cared about me like that before
[0:37:43] <+Aerobatics1> people say "no fun allowed" but they dont realize if they alloawed walk offs and shit there would just be camping to win
[0:37:45] <SuckPuppet> add another question mark
[0:37:46] <%able_beard> So basically Smash rulesets are determined by those who complain the most.
[0:37:54] <DynamicMenace_> just use bf or omega for the stages FeelsWeirdMan
[0:37:57] <LegendaryDorkKnight> So the lesson from this Smash is trash go play a real game Kappa
[0:38:00] <@Menitta> So in conclusion: Hoes Mad
[0:38:00] <InXplotch> walk offs are very bad
[0:38:02] <majesticpaladin> Pat was right holy fuck
[0:38:07] <+TruSanKyuu> Change launch rate to .9
[0:38:11] <+NumeroHoowan> hoes mad, hoes mad
[0:38:12] <Ace_Clef> If were basing competitive stages off of Mac exploits, then we should ban ledges and falling in general.

[1:43:34] <FlameLoneWolf> Haru best grill
[1:43:36] <%jubejube56> lol "ultimate summon" is certainly one way to say Persona
[1:43:38] <primaryfire> arson
[1:43:44] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Lab it up
[1:43:52] <odd_slater> For his neutral special Joker wields a gun.
[1:43:55] <bustawof> I was hoping his jab would change into a stand rush with arsene out
[1:44:01] <@Solidus_113> it's both
[1:44:06] <weissguard> ^
[1:44:07] <+Story_Ark> he just ran out
[1:44:13] <@Solidus_113> Makara+Tetra
[1:44:21] <+YuriReeka> joker is amazing
[1:44:25] <%BoxNavy> well thats leo
[1:44:29] <%Cobra743> Put down Harambe
[1:44:32] <%yeknomlive> is he hitting bayo status?
[1:44:32] <Ristwach> Woolie is about to be the next Mkleo
[1:44:32] <AncelDeLambert> he's winning everything just like his mom did
[1:44:36] <+Weeewer> The best player in the world plays Joker
[1:44:36] <Rhinoprotoss> Zero is an idiot tho
[1:44:37] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Joker and Bayonetta just blast fools
[1:44:37] <%Solidnick18> i hope so
[1:44:41] <Jetsfantasy> Bayonetts son Kappa
[1:44:42] <prime_name> Is Joker the new Bayonetta 4?
[1:44:42] <Valkenhym> LUL Blaming Joker instead of the player being really good
[1:44:43] <%Knoxx_Gold> Hold B and jump for rainstorm
[1:44:46] <+TopTieramisu> so joker is the melee puff of ultimate?
[1:44:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:44:48] <+Weeewer> Zero makes click bait a lot these days
[1:44:49] <+ner0romanov> Zero didn't say Joker was destroying the game.
[1:44:49] <zenith0111> Oh no another Bayonetta scenario?
[1:44:50] <%BoxNavy> marth had to get soooo many buffs though
[1:44:51] <+YuriReeka> mkleo is a an amazing player, it's not just joker
[1:44:54] <%BoxNavy> he was bad at first
[1:44:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> people call every new character that does well broken Joker's just good not busted
[1:44:59] <theshadowproducer> i dont like the little ppurple foot sparka on this stage
[1:44:59] <+Weeewer> @zenith0111 not nearly that close. Everyone was playing Bayo
[1:45:01] <CalderGaming> all i can hear is the sound of people failing to adapt Kappa
[1:45:02] <FlameLoneWolf> He's not neatly as broken as Bayo was
[1:45:06] <LegendaryDorkKnight> MOTIVATED
[1:45:07] <+RollTheD20> @prime_name MK Leo is just that good
[1:45:11] <@Solidus_113> it's also the highest jump in the game
[1:45:12] <%jubejube56> Mkleo was winning tournies long before Joker
[1:45:17] <Ristwach> Mkleo makes Joker work just like how Infiltration made SFV Juri work
[1:45:17] <bendatron> that being said hes still a really good character
[1:45:21] <+RollTheD20> joker isnt inherently super busted like bayo
[1:45:22] <%BoxNavy> i dont think its fair to base character results off of leo
[1:45:39] <odd_slater> Zero didn't ask if Arsene was destroying the game yeah
[1:45:40] <FlameLoneWolf> Balls exposed
[1:46:04] <+Weeewer> VERY
[1:46:06] <+Weeewer> It does DOT
[1:46:12] <%Solidnick18> yes
[1:46:12] <blairINtheUSA> Leo just clicked with the character
[1:46:13] <+Weeewer> It does like 12% of Dot
[1:46:17] <Triplicat> wow my favorite granblue fantasy character Joker is in smash
[1:46:20] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @woolieversus mementos is kind of a bad stage to practice on because hazards and also it's much bigger than any legal stage
[1:46:27] <Greedboyz> Teach him upair drag down combos
[1:46:27] <@Solidus_113> I think you can do up grab into grapple hook for a combo
[1:46:28] <%Solidnick18> It does big dot damage
[1:46:32] <+Story_Ark> better to just turn off hazards
[1:46:35] <ThePixelMan421> Mini Thanos snap.
[1:46:40] <+Weeewer> You can do Gun cancels
[1:46:42] <prime_name> Better Elfire

[1:46:46] <+Weeewer> Press jump while shooting gun @WoolieVersus
[1:47:00] <%Ninestempest> Ninestempest subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! YEAH SMASHHHHHHHH
[1:47:00] <%jubejube56> gun cancels, gun jump, rainstorm
[1:47:01] <%MichaelDood> Yusuke lookin cool
[1:47:14] <Jetsfantasy> Now's he's just a free W
[1:47:19] <CalderGaming> are tick throws much of a thing in this game? because that seems like a good way to punish jokers being too liberal with arsene charging
[1:47:20] <FlameLoneWolf> Show the wacky gun chains
[1:47:36] <%Ninestempest> Lucas/Roy/Mewtwo/Piranha Plant (which NOW has to be bought) were bad at launch, this "dlc is good" thing has never been 100% accurate
[1:47:39] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> conspiracy theory: piranha plant was supposed to be included in base game but wasn't finished so they made him freeLC
[1:47:41] <+TestAnon> Banjo confirmed top tier Kreygasm
[1:47:43] <+Weeewer> @CalderGaming with only a few chars. Example is Lucas down tilt into grab
[1:47:49] <CalderGaming> ty
[1:47:50] <%BoxNavy> go to FD
[1:48:04] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Samsho looks gud
[1:48:28] <manstertruck> @WoolieVersus it's up throw up air
[1:48:29] <+smokkssb> no you cant do that
[1:48:30] <%lapislafooly> samsho plays great
[1:48:33] <%Ninestempest> c stick would help a LOT here
[1:48:40] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Down Trowww
[1:48:45] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> does it have good netcode tho naroSmug
[1:48:47] <%Ninestempest> oh that's a LOT closer
[1:48:50] <wal__rus> closer
[1:48:51] <+Weeewer> I play with a pro controller so I just do Jump + Attack for the short hop aerial short cut
[1:48:58] <%lapislafooly> even with my bad connection online worked pretty well
[1:49:02] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> is woolie playing with tap jump or no
[1:49:04] <+yaboymatch> do down throw nair or fair instead
[1:49:07] <CalderGaming> big improvement from FNF is that I don't log on to this stream and see blind stumbling around in day 1 samsho, there's always a clinic
[1:49:09] <%BoxNavy> it doenst work cus it counts as a regrab i think
[1:49:16] <manstertruck> It does work
[1:49:20] <manstertruck> it's just not off down throw
[1:49:27] <%BoxNavy> oh no kidding
[1:49:34] <%Ninestempest> ... so it doesn't work
[1:49:40] <%Ninestempest> cause he's trying to do d throw up b
[1:49:41] <Dragon_boy21> So, how good is Joker?
[1:49:42] <+Weeewer> Up throw works I think
[1:49:49] <manstertruck> it'd work if he di's in
[1:49:49] <+Weeewer> Or Up Air - Land - Up B
[1:49:54] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> also even at the same percent you have to account for DI
[1:49:55] <+yaboymatch> joker is top 10 easy
[1:49:58] <+yaboymatch> very good
[1:49:59] <Valkenhym> Joker is good as is and better with Arsene
[1:50:03] <manstertruck> the angle is just wrong for it to ACTUALLY work
[1:50:12] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:50:14] <sadhappymad3> I can’t believe they didn’t turn off stage interactions
[1:50:18] <wal__rus> this stage LUL
[1:50:19] <+yaboymatch> this is a terrible stage to practice on lol
[1:50:24] <+Weeewer> Mastering movement shouod be step one
[1:50:28] <+Weeewer> Learn to go off stage
[1:50:32] <theshadowproducer> allright im out
[1:50:39] <theshadowproducer> later guys
[1:50:39] <+Weeewer> Combos is too char dependent for someone as new as Woolie I think
[1:50:40] <sadhappymad3> Don’t listen to that man woolie just pick ryu
[1:50:45] <+Thunder_Poo> Sweaty Woolie!
[1:50:46] <LegendaryDorkKnight> They don't have the basics they gotta trainnnn
[1:50:57] <$FuqBoiSlim> swamp slime
[1:50:59] <Hocotate> dthrow to fair or rar bair work. uthrow to uair works
[1:51:03] <%Ninestempest> just have dk punch him to lose arsene
[1:51:06] <sadhappymad3> Combos the same at mostly every percent
[1:51:13] <zenith0111> Basically one move combos one move kills
[1:51:24] <+Weeewer> @sadhappymad3 nooot true lol
[1:51:38] <+Weeewer> Greninja for example has to change his follow ups from down tilt several times throughout a stock
[1:51:38] <%Ninestempest> rip true
[1:51:42] <wal__rus> PogChamp
[1:51:48] <%Ninestempest> also that looks like a DI read
[1:51:48] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:51:51] <Hocotate> you can go to advanced in the training menu and use "P1 damage" to get/lose Arsene
[1:51:55] <bustawof> That first hit of fair is so good
[1:52:05] <VJdarkworld> GUN wooliePOYO
[1:52:14] <%Frostychip> RAINSTORM
[1:52:15] <sadhappymad3> @weeewer I meant to say ryu combos are mostly the same at every percent

[1:52:31] <%jubejube56> I mean technically there is a "shoot up" input

[1:52:36] <TheBrunoZone> Gun Training Session
[1:52:40] <zenith0111> How committed are you with the rainstorm?
[1:52:42] <+Weeewer> Down Air with Arsene is a spike
[1:52:49] <sadhappymad3> Yea woolie would understand him more that’s what made me understand smash
[1:53:08] <fireking900> DMC1 on Switch btw Dante is def coming to Smash now
[1:53:20] <sadhappymad3> But typically smash players don’t know shotos
[1:53:25] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @fireking900 don't give me hope
[1:53:26] <LegendaryDorkKnight> DANTE!?
[1:53:27] <+Weeewer> Woolie needs to work on movement like fast falling and jumping off stage and coming and coming back
[1:53:30] <FlameLoneWolf> I'd love Dante to make it in
[1:53:31] <Valkenhym> LUL Better Shiek with more kill power
[1:53:35] <DekuDakota> you can also shoot down from the ground, if you shoot then immediately press jump
[1:53:37] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:53:42] <zenith0111> @fireking900 My favorite Nintendo character Kappa

[1:54:00] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @rebellious_phantom its basically prepatch sm4sh sheik in ultimate naroSmug
[1:54:05] <Sonicdy> @Stay_Hydrated_Bot thanks bot
[1:54:11] <LegendaryDorkKnight> I never thought devil may cry would be on a Nintendo platform lol
[1:54:19] <+HyperCharge_Sam> yeah, it's kind of lame how he can get the stuffing beat out of him and still get arsen
[1:54:27] <ThePixelMan421> Here’s hoping for Bandana Dee and Phoenix Wright as fighters.
[1:54:28] <%Ninestempest> guaranteed 1, if you're good at living, 2
[1:54:35] <odd_slater> Can we even say the "has to be on a Nintendo console" rule exists for Smash when it was never confirmed and people just assumed?
[1:54:40] <+Weeewer> If youre good at Down B then you get several
[1:54:46] <+Weeewer> Its nice
[1:54:46] <%yeknomlive> well said
[1:54:47] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @legendarydorkknight dante was already in project X zone naroSmug
[1:54:53] <%Ninestempest> @odd_slater we dont know but it still applies so it's a safe standard
[1:54:53] <zenith0111> Snakes last video game is Smash :') Weird timeline
[1:54:55] <+Jake_Protagonist> People think hes not fair because MKleo wins with him basically
[1:55:01] <Saltmeisterr> adapt or die
[1:55:10] <+Weeewer> MK Leo was so good he was killing it before Joker
[1:55:13] <+StrikeTheErf> feels like people who complain about Joker don't like any character that doesn't encourage constant blind aggression
[1:55:13] <%jubejube56> @odd_slater there are very strong ties to the rule, especially with characters like Cloud or Joker
[1:55:16] <Valkenhym> FeelsBadMan Don't remind me about Metal Gear and Survive
[1:55:17] <+Weeewer> Its a matter of the player being so good
[1:55:18] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug oh yeah I forgot about that trash
[1:55:20] <%Ninestempest> he was but he wasn't nearly as dominating before joker
[1:55:27] <%Ninestempest> he wasn't 3-0ing grand finals like it was a joke
[1:55:31] <+Weeewer> true
[1:55:32] <wal__rus> leo is just on another level when it comes to sm4sh and ultimate
[1:55:32] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @odd_slater the rule might as well be broken with joker anyway because pq2 wasn't even out yet when he was announced
[1:55:41] <ThePixelMan421> Peach is probably the best.
[1:55:46] <+Jake_Protagonist> Even Link is good in this game
[1:55:47] <SuckPuppet> thanks Bamco
[1:56:04] <zenith0111> Alright time for Bowser to win a tournament Kappa
[1:56:05] <keiji_maede> It's not MvC2....... Thank god!!
[1:56:09] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> even with arsene his recovery can kinda be read easy and punished easy
[1:56:10] <odd_slater> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug It was out in JP
[1:56:18] <%jubejube56> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug doesn't really matter when the game is announced does it? More so matters when the business deals are made
[1:56:22] <BestTeaMaker> MKLeo made Ike look broken, he made Wolf look broken, he made Lucina look broken, and he made Joker look broken
[1:56:23] <+Weeewer> In ANY situation you can both be on the ledge
[1:56:31] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @odd_slater i thought it hadn't come out yet in JP by the announcement tho
[1:56:32] <+Weeewer> Ah thats wha tyou mean
[1:56:49] <+Jake_Protagonist> Lucas
[1:56:49] <+Weeewer> Lucas
[1:56:53] <+Jake_Protagonist> Samus i think
[1:56:53] <sileo_patronus> Ivysaur
[1:56:55] <ThePixelMan421> Looking Cool Joker.
[1:56:59] <+Weeewer> Zamus
[1:57:00] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @jubejube56 true I guess. still a pretty loose rule that doesn't exclude many
[1:57:03] <ThePixelMan421> The Samuses.
[1:57:06] <%MichaelDood> Olimar...oh wait Kappa
[1:57:17] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Snake was on NES
[1:57:17] <odd_slater> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug It did iirc
[1:57:18] <edward11231> Belmont’s
[1:57:18] <+sonimon123> Toon Link
[1:57:19] <%jubejube56> Even in Joker's case, they already had plans for Q2 and P5R on the switch
[1:57:24] <BestTeaMaker> Olimar's still good, just now he doesn't have free smashes
[1:57:37] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @odd_slater guess I just have bad memory naroSmug
[1:57:39] <%jubejube56> for Cloud they included him in that weird 3DS title then an ff7 port much later
[1:57:39] <+Weeewer> Smash 2
[1:57:40] <BestTeaMaker> although, the shield thing is kinda bs and is probably gonna get patched
[1:57:48] <bustawof> P5S not P5R
[1:57:49] <+Jake_Protagonist> That applies to dodge rolling too
[1:57:51] <%MichaelDood> Did they play Olimar any?
[1:57:53] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @jubejube56 do you mean P5S because P5R hasn't been announced for switch yet
[1:58:00] <wal__rus> rolls also stale
[1:58:04] <BestTeaMaker> you think Chester or Woolie play any setup character?
[1:58:04] <LegendaryDorkKnight> We can all agree it's a fast and loose rule
[1:58:08] <BestTeaMaker> in smash?
[1:58:19] <+R_BChe> do u reall think sakurai goes "oh darn, this character hasnt had a game on nintendo yet, guess we cant add em" at this point in time
[1:58:25] <%Ninestempest> P5S isn't a thing unless something's announced I'm not aware of
[1:58:39] <+Weeewer> @burritocheetos after Joker, anythings possible lol
[1:58:40] <+Jake_Protagonist> You gonna teach advanced stuff like instant turn around back airs and stuff?
[1:58:41] <AnarchyWolves> I like the Persona 3 map
[1:58:50] <Sonicdy> at this point the dlc is from Nintendo list
[1:58:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:58:52] <ThePixelMan421> @burritocheetos It’s more a pattern than a rule. At least to me.
[1:58:52] <zenith0111> @burritocheetos Like who?
[1:58:53] <+Weeewer> P5S = P5 Strikers, the Musou game
[1:58:54] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @burritocheetos but they have all been on Nintendo platforms at some point, coincidence? I think not! Kappa
[1:58:56] <%Ninestempest> @burritocheetos no, but nintendo probably does, and I'd imagine they have a bigger say on what's allowed
[1:59:00] <BestTeaMaker> scramble, not strikers
[1:59:01] <%Ninestempest> oh right the stupid musou game
[1:59:04] <%Ninestempest> i erased that from my fucking memory
[1:59:05] <%jubejube56> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug okay that is my bad, totally thought P5R was going to the switch for some reason
[1:59:08] <odd_slater> But I don't think Cloud was added in Wii U in anticipation of anything I think that's where the "rule" kinda falls flat a bit
[1:59:10] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @burritocheetos all the deals were made and coding programmed for master chief then sakurai realized "ah shit he's not on a nintendo console yet" so they scrapped him and went with banjo naroSmug
[1:59:11] <%jubejube56> guess I can dream
[1:59:17] <BestTeaMaker> Cloud was added to rep final fantasy
[1:59:19] <+R_BChe> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug LUL
[1:59:22] <BestTeaMaker> since he's the most famous ff character
[1:59:25] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @jubejube56 if atlus liked money they would port it but they don't so they won't
[1:59:36] <+Jake_Protagonist> he knows about DI im guessing right?
[1:59:40] <BestTeaMaker> and technically, he was in chain of memories and theatrhythm
[1:59:41] <fireking900> Still raying for P5A BlessRNG
[1:59:42] <Sonicdy> remember the DLC is from nintendo List
[1:59:47] <zenith0111> Cloud is the only non-nintendo character but FF games have been on NES hm
[1:59:47] <%jubejube56> besides Atlus still owes the switch a SMT game
[1:59:50] <fireking900> *praying
[1:59:55] <%Toynota10> woolieCHAN
[1:59:58] <manstertruck> @odd_slater there's always the rythmn game
[2:00:01] <%MichaelDood> @jubejube56 ^^^
[2:00:04] <odd_slater> I lowkey feel like Joker doubles as an SMT rep kind of
[2:00:09] <odd_slater> @manstertruck lol
[2:00:13] <%Ninestempest> woolie you're doing nair not fair
[2:00:14] <BestTeaMaker> i mean, persona is a SMT spinoff
[2:00:17] <+Jake_Protagonist> Well you can shorthop by tapping jump lighter
[2:00:19] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug LUL
[2:00:21] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> chatroom, hear me out: Nier: Automata switch port and 2B for smash announced in the same direct
[2:00:24] <+KilogramHours> Who is the pro that is playing with them?
[2:00:35] <zenith0111> SMT was on super famicon which is OG NES
[2:00:35] <+Weeewer> I think like, almost everyone uses C-stick aerials
[2:00:35] <+Story_Ark> you can also press both jump buttons to shortho0
[2:00:37] <BestTeaMaker> Z, he's a TO in the MTL area
[2:00:42] <odd_slater> Not a lot of P5 newcomers know that unfortuantely @BestTeaMaker
[2:00:46] <VJdarkworld> halo infinite releases and the ending is master chief getting the smash invitation letter :O
[2:00:53] <+YuriReeka> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug dante and 2B in smash is the dream
[2:00:53] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug no disagreement here
[2:00:57] <%jubejube56> 2B gonna compete with Geralt for most unnecessary game crossovers?
[2:01:02] <%Ninestempest> whens sora in smash
[2:01:12] <bustawof> But travis touchdown tho
[2:01:12] <+R_BChe> 2b isnt unecessary, shes the requirement
[2:01:14] <%Ninestempest> I need a third jrpg protag with a sword and magic STAT
[2:01:16] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> TIL C Stick can fast fall
[2:01:27] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Minecraft character Kappa
[2:01:28] <Mr_Taters > I would really like MC in smash @VJdarkworld
[2:01:29] <zenith0111> If Dante makes it that will be the first non Nintendo related character.
[2:01:30] <42nfl19> When he's not on the screen, everyone should be asking "Where's John Halo?"
[2:01:32] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @yurireeka hell yes. give me more platinum reps
[2:01:32] <Sonicdy> @Ninestempest when disney is not suck Kappa
[2:01:37] <SuckPuppet> man games are in a bad place for characters if people are still hung up on 2B
[2:01:44] <BestTeaMaker> except DMC1
[2:01:45] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> wait shit dante isn't platinum right
[2:01:46] <BestTeaMaker> is now on switch
[2:01:49] <BestTeaMaker> so Dante counts now
[2:01:52] <fireking900> How can a crossover be "unnecessary"? More Chars mean more fun
[2:01:52] <BestTeaMaker> Kappa
[2:01:54] <%Ninestempest> @Sonicdy i know yo'ure joking but i kind of doubt disney cares about sora as much as which properties square can use
[2:02:17] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> technically dante "counted" before with PXZone
[2:02:18] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug no he's Capcom
[2:02:28] <zenith0111> @bestteamaker Do ports count?
[2:02:33] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @legendarydorkknight rip I am big dumb
[2:02:33] <DanteReaver> Bruh I just came to talk about AoT anime
[2:02:35] <BestTeaMaker> why not?
[2:02:38] <%MichaelDood> GUN KATA!
[2:02:38] <BestTeaMaker> Snake was in Twin Snakes
[2:02:40] <FlameLoneWolf> All I want to make it into the DLC roster is Dante and 2B
[2:02:42] <DanteReaver> I'm f'd up
[2:02:44] <+Story_Ark> yall know they dont have any rules for characters anymore right? sakurai just picks what he wants
[2:02:45] <%MichaelDood> sbfpYeyeye
[2:02:49] <odd_slater> As much as I would love Nier on Switch I'm kinda getting tired of ports with a compromise. There's too many triple A games that have either poor battery life or neutered visuals.
[2:02:49] <Sonicdy> @Ninestempest so why theres no ff char in kh3??
[2:02:49] <%jubejube56> I mean crossovers are first and foremost an advertising play. See the terminator stuff from E3
[2:02:50] <BestTeaMaker> as well as the original MG games
[2:02:51] <zenith0111> @bestteamaker He started on NES tho
[2:02:52] <BestTeaMaker> which were ports
[2:02:53] <TLPenn> You guys know Devil May Cry 1 is on Switch right now, right?
[2:02:55] <BestTeaMaker> those games were also ports
[2:02:58] <BestTeaMaker> from the PC Engine
[2:05:20] <mercado94> Thats a pretty dumb rule
[2:05:21] <@Menitta> "fuck your rules we do what we want" -Sakurai
[2:05:23] <ThePixelMan421> I want live action Sonic but he’s intentionally the worst character.
[2:05:25] <%Ninestempest> they're the equivalent of shoulder macros in other games tbh
[2:05:26] <Spirit_NB> I didn't know about 2 jump buttons for shorthop
[2:05:35] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @odd_slater ever play UMVC3
[2:05:36] <TLPenn> Hey, the rule technically still holds.
[2:05:37] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> isn't the auto shorthop aerial kind of bad for joker because you can't dragdown too
[2:05:37] <%Ninestempest> rising aerials and short hops
[2:05:39] <%yeknomlive> woooah i didnt even know that
[2:05:40] <%BoxNavy> the double button short hop thing was patched it during the plant update even
[2:05:41] <+YuriReeka> i think hero's release date is gonna be revealed at evo
[2:05:47] <Sonicdy> so sakurai is pick the dlc char from nintendo's lsit
[2:05:51] <manstertruck> I like the ability to set a button to short hop in rivals
[2:05:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:05:53] <+Story_Ark> the rule holds but that means nothing if they dont care
[2:05:55] <Spirit_NB> Not entirely true. ANY attack from a shorthop deals less damage, except B moves
[2:05:56] <manstertruck> that was cool
[2:06:00] <bustawof> Well fuck me I was doing it the hard way
[2:06:03] <XaariOW> !MOTIVATED
[2:06:03] <+Story_Ark> Nintendo already said they dont look at the rule too much
[2:06:03] <@Moobot> 420 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:06:11] <+Story_Ark> plus Joker was decided before PQ2
[2:06:11] <XaariOW> 420 PogChamp
[2:06:15] <LegendaryDorkKnight> !MOTIVATED
[2:06:17] <%BoxNavy> 420 POGGERS
[2:06:25] <MutedMimic> CiGrip
[2:06:25] <DanteReaver> @Nineball_Luce wait was that always the case?
[2:06:26] <TLPenn> Yeah, short hop aerials do less damage than normal aerials.
[2:06:33] <DanteReaver> Or is it new to Ultimate
[2:06:38] <+RollTheD20> I might turn tap jump off now that I know about pressing two jump buttons
[2:06:41] <+Weeewer> new to ultimate
[2:06:43] <Spirit_NB> @dantereaver New in Ultimate
[2:06:47] <DanteReaver> ah ok
[2:06:52] <+Weeewer> I have like, 3 jump buttons on my pro controller
[2:06:52] <extradopeness> DIFFERENT STRAIN BRO
[2:06:57] <Mr_Taters > @TLPenn That's interesting, had no idea about that
[2:07:04] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @rollthed20 also it doesn't have to be x and y it can be any two jump buttons you bind
[2:07:05] <odd_slater> @LegendaryDorkKnight Yeah but that's completely different from Smash it made sense for a hyper fighter to have a character with so many moves and tools
[2:07:11] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus when Sakurai talked about the mechanic in a direct, it was the first time Sakurai ever said the words "shorthop"
[2:07:13] <Spirit_NB> The multiplier for shothop attacks is 0.85, for those curious. it shouldn't stop you from utilizing them
[2:07:14] <wal__rus> some people even jump with a trigger
[2:07:17] <+RollTheD20> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug that's so sick
[2:07:23] <TLPenn> I put tilt attacks on my right stick.
[2:07:36] <extradopeness> Oh yeah smart
[2:07:37] <%Ninestempest> Can the guest on stream explain why putting special on the trigger enables wave bouncing? I thought it was just precise stick movement
[2:07:37] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus Did you go over Dash-canceling with Tilts? It is actually super important.
[2:07:38] <ThePixelMan421> Sans joins the battle
[2:07:46] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @odd_slater I think they could do it just have the tilts use different weapons and his specials be stinger and shit
[2:11:23] <SomersaultJustice> you can claim their soul and sell it
[2:11:23] <%thetrashman_sc> SHOVEL KNIGHT

[2:29:53] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @woolieversus technically its not the original game nintendo put out because most of the time if an event is using roms they're using universal controller fix too

[2:30:03] <%Toynota10> Is it just one match, 2?
[2:30:04] <@Solidus_113> IT'S WOOL
[2:30:05] <%jubejube56> Wool knows the strats
[2:30:07] <%GohanEgret> give reggie the SUCC
[2:30:08] <@Menitta> WOOL PLS
[2:30:08] <zenith0111> Act 2
[2:30:09] <SomersaultJustice> Blight Kirby
[2:30:13] <%BoxNavy> kirby will never be good NotLikeThis
[2:30:13] <wal__rus> ddd is more like sepia toned
[2:30:13] <+gespenst25> Tanomono yo, kaabi!
[2:30:19] <%BoxNavy> again i mean
[2:30:20] <$2j_hunter> can we join to fight with u guys!?
[2:30:21] <OkamiDude15> i cant believe wool is about to get a perfect live on stream
[2:30:23] <sunnythedrunk> It's not really worth to try to get in for 1 match
[2:30:34] <FlameLoneWolf> Even a Melee stage
[2:30:36] <fireking900> Who has more of a Soul. Reggie or Pat?
[2:30:41] <primaryfire> do you think giorno can just body swap with anything dead
[2:30:42] <%BoxNavy> @2j_hunter yeah. id and pass are on screen
[2:30:43] <sadhappymad3> Not gonna bother seems too hard to get in
[2:30:49] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> his hammer is for styling and mind games
[2:30:50] <Psyramics> When Smash first came out, it shared a platform with an actual real StarFox game!
[2:30:52] <zenith0111> Real Kirby? PogChamp
[2:30:59] <@Menitta> Ok, Wool was going on about being a TRUE KIRBY MAIN in the discord so HE TOTALLY IS GONNA WIN
[2:31:01] <TLPenn> This is actually Pokemon Stadium 2.
[2:31:01] <Spirit_NB> can't his hammer 2 frame? think it could in 4
[2:31:11] <JJostar> roy can do that too
[2:31:11] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> does kirby's hammer reach below the stage or is it just dedede's
[2:31:12] <SomersaultJustice> it's Kirby Super Star hammer
[2:31:15] <@Solidus_113> I can't believe Wool already won the match
[2:31:24] <@akuda_bar> everyone get ready to watch all of Wool's careful labbing fall perfectly into place
[2:31:26] <+Kryterra> How do we get in que for a fight?
[2:31:26] <SuckPuppet> @Psyramics Melee shared a console with the best Starfox game
[2:31:37] <@Menitta> its crazy how he's just letting Reggie think he can win for this long
[2:31:37] <UnfilteredComic> Hammer has a huge hitbox and really strong super armor on hit
[2:31:39] <ThePixelMan421> Ironically that hammer is OP in most Kirby games.
[2:31:43] <+Story_Ark> @kryterra put in the id and hope foe the best
[2:31:59] <+gespenst25> Fox is a BULLY
[2:32:00] <@akuda_bar> he got to >100% on purpose
[2:32:03] <@akuda_bar> it motivates him
[2:32:05] <+Kryterra> @story_ark Thanks

[2:32:08] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[2:32:08] <+gespenst25> Good boy Kirby!

[2:32:10] <zenith0111> @thepixelman421 Coincidentally*
[2:32:14] <@Menitta> yeah its to give himself a real challenge
[2:32:16] <@Solidus_113> 100% gives him rage
[2:32:19] <%jubejube56> Wool is currently playing on 116 levels of Yomi
[2:32:19] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @woolieversus it was only his forward and back throw, up and down couldn't mash out of
[2:32:27] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> I think
[2:32:27] <OkamiDude15> wool with the strats

[2:33:17] <UnfilteredComic> Kirby is a solid pick in this game
[2:33:18] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus Kirby is considered one of the worst in Ultimate.
[2:33:19] <%thetrashman_sc> TEABAG
[2:33:20] <gamingpenguin52> @WoolieVersus remember how bloodstained has a few Jojo references? I found a ring in one of the late game areas whose description is "A ring that bestows both luck and pluck to would-be gamblers"

[2:41:24] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the game doesn't even let me spam refresh
[2:41:26] <+Weeewer> Yeah but its got a password
[2:41:28] <@Menitta> You can't mash refresh
[2:41:30] <@Menitta> Its insane
[2:41:32] <+NomadNoah> It's good for zoning but it kinda works against how Joker wants to play
[2:41:33] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus uuuuugh I really want to dumpster Z....
[2:41:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is so much harder to join then tekken

[2:42:49] <%jubejube56> See the key is you need to figure out the equation of stream delay +/- delay to figure out the exact second that the refresh should occur
[2:42:54] <%jubejube56> then macro the room password
[2:42:57] <@Solidus_113> it's about 5 seconds

[2:58:58] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus You cant see mii names online
[2:59:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> 4
[2:59:00] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus that only works offline, remember that online it shows account name only
[2:59:01] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus 4 for each
[2:59:04] <%zaworldo> OH YEAH LOOK AT THIS MII FIGHTER SU C K
[2:59:09] <manstertruck> @WoolieVersus moveset number is 4 digits
[2:59:10] <%jubejube56> 3 for each special
[2:59:19] <%BoxNavy> thats a touhou reference
[2:59:20] <@Solidus_113> the 9 is their Switch ID
[2:59:35] <InXplotch> essentially, yeah
[2:59:39] <+KilogramHours> 4 and 4
[2:59:41] <wal__rus> this is looking ugly
[2:59:41] <manstertruck> @WoolieVersus like 3123 or 1213
[2:59:43] <+MagicBeanBurrito> 4x4x4
[2:59:47] <MayorRev> @woolieversus basically it's based on 4 moves, 4 variants each. example: you might see a guy named 1123 or 2134
[2:59:51] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @woolieversus it's not really 12 characters because only specials change
[2:59:53] <wal__rus> my man got washed by a mii fighter
[2:59:55] <zenith0111> Mii fighters look so bad
[2:59:58] <+KilogramHours> 4 for each special

[3:00:22] <+EndgameContent> Is That Fucking Undertale
[3:00:23] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus There's optimal mii moves so usually you know what you're up against, and they're mostly rip offs of other fighter moves
[3:00:23] <FlameLoneWolf> Got shit beat out of ya by a Mii
[3:00:25] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @woolieversus the good thing is that no one usually plays miis so you don't have to learn the matchup naroSmug

[3:01:08] <CharlesRobinJr> oof
[3:01:14] <%Ninestempest> @WoolieVersus in tournaments not only are they named after the moveset, but you usually are required to show the moveset when asked, at the button check usually. The idea of going into a tournament and not knowing the Mii moves is fucking absurd
[3:01:15] <+Story_Ark> same, i really wanna play but i dont think ill ever get into a match T_T
[3:01:15] <RealPT1> Mii moves feel more like picking assists or arcanas/infinity stones

[3:40:39] <%Ninestempest> Chat, did Z teach Woolie optimal survival DI? cause it isn't the same as Melee
[3:40:45] <+blastazoid00> f
[3:40:49] <+DatLatinoGuy> lmao
[3:40:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> pika is definitely top 15 but arguably is held back from lack of kill moves and small weight
[3:41:00] <dredshift> Buff the movie
[3:41:02] <@Menitta> its good
[3:41:14] <@Menitta> Pikachu is super fun in Pokken
[3:41:18] <FlameLoneWolf> Shoulda brought the mice to see it's brother, Pikachu
[3:41:19] <%MichaelDood> Reggie keepin those priorities
[3:41:19] <%Ninestempest> I think pika is better than top 10 but results do hurt him :/
[3:41:21] <%BoxNavy> PokPikachu
[3:41:22] <+Capta1n_H3nry> I think the Akechi colors are giving you bad luck
[3:41:27] <+Qsmash_> Pikachu is good in every game
[3:41:28] <%jubejube56> Can't wait for the next Sonic the Hedgehog movie patch notes
[3:41:29] <@Menitta> PokPikachu
[3:41:33] <%Order_of_Mystery> detective pikachu is fantastic. I want the next movie to just be day to day life with pokemon, tho
[3:41:38] <%MichaelDood> @jubejube56 LUL
[3:41:42] <BestTeaMaker> problem is that Pikachu's only major rep is ESAM
[3:41:44] <+jessedouglas> PokMaskedpika PokMaskedpika PokMaskedpika PokMaskedpika
[3:41:47] <fireking900> I thought he was gonna say she ghosted him like Damn Reggie taking Ls everywhere
[3:41:50] <@Menitta> He's straight up Heihachi in Pokken
[3:41:50] <BestTeaMaker> not a lot of pikachus at his level
[3:41:50] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @ninestempest problem is that the only top player who plays him is ESAM and while he has high highs he's kind of inconsistent
[3:41:56] <LeafarOz> the lag cam be seen
[3:41:59] <BestTeaMaker> ESAM has really good moments
[3:42:00] <LeafarOz> can
[3:42:04] <BestTeaMaker> beating Tweek and MKLeo and such
[3:44:47] <BestTeaMaker> he knows how to play multiple characters
[3:44:47] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @woolieversus I don't think it's true anymore. it was in smash 4, but DI dependent
[3:44:55] <+R_BChe> rawr XD
[3:45:09] <OkamiDude15> is rawr xd in thunder a kill combo? woopsThink
[3:45:09] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @esp_root yea and it's probably one of the best ultimate yoshis naroSmug

[3:45:40] <tigeruppercut1226> big iq pacman
[3:45:43] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:45:43] <%Ninestempest> in melee he's carried by Axe
[3:45:44] <BestTeaMaker> I remember Ron won a tournament very early in Japan
[3:45:44] <+Qsmash_> Pikachu is okay in Brawl
[3:45:47] <SomersaultJustice> PACKED MAN
[3:45:47] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @woolieversus no, pika was good in brawl too. he's mid tier in melee but axe just won smash summit so thats arguable too
[3:45:51] <extradopeness> doodCap doodCap doodCap doodCap
[3:45:53] <StarMechV> I give up, have fun
[3:45:55] <%BoxNavy> pac it up folks

[3:46:11] <+KilogramHours> Tea and Sinji
[3:46:11] <%BoxNavy> pac is good in this game
[3:46:21] <+KilogramHours> tea and sinji are the best with PAC
[3:46:23] <%Wool> I secondary Isabelle if for some reason no one is trying to play lol
[3:46:24] <%BoxNavy> yeah actually
[3:46:26] <SomersaultJustice> Valkyrie would have been cool
[3:46:32] <%ohnoitspooba> Please win, Pac man.

[3:46:37] <+KilogramHours> PAC-MAN is too iconic to not be in Smash
[3:46:37] <+NekoNinja13> Klonoa
[3:46:39] <SomersaultJustice> but Ilike Pac Man anyway so eh
[3:46:41] <extradopeness> Is that Anthony Fantano?
[3:46:41] <BestTeaMaker> there's Bocchi, the Isabella who's gained ground recently after taking out Ally in a local
[3:46:54] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @wool why would you pick up isabelle as a secondary like what MU is that gonna help for naroSmug
[3:46:55] <zenith0111> Wifi Warriors Code
[3:46:57] <BestTeaMaker> but even she thinks Isabelle is still ass
[3:47:01] <+HyperCharge_Sam> I want L Block in smash Kappa
[3:47:14] <%Ninestempest> yink can't fucking killlllllll
[3:47:23] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> thats because the laggy people are so used to playing in lag its normal to them
[3:47:27] <BestTeaMaker> what? yink has a lot of kill setups
[3:47:29] <majindusto> lytWAH Waluigi for Smash lytWAH
[3:47:45] <%Ninestempest> that is really not the same
[3:47:53] <wal__rus> yink has a high tech ceiling but hes really hard to play imo
[3:47:54] <%Ninestempest> require specific spacing or certain confirms
[3:48:10] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> playing in lag is like the opposite of that one rock lee gaara fight where you're forced to put on super heavy ankle weights but the other guy's had them on the whole time
[3:48:13] <NiftyNox> We cry
[3:48:14] <BestTeaMaker> sure, but uair/fair/dair are amazing
[3:48:21] <wal__rus> toon link is by far the worst link
[3:48:25] <SomersaultJustice> now say you didn't like wind waker and go for the trifecta
[3:48:26] <FlameLoneWolf> ToonLink mains can suffer
[3:48:32] <wolvenelf> tink mains dont exist
[3:48:33] <%Ninestempest> I'm not saying he's bad at all, just that he has trouble killing
[3:48:36] <insaneintentionsyo> yooooo
[3:48:49] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> toon link mains make you say "wait, you main toon link?" and if you say that they've already won
[3:48:49] <NiftyNox> This is the first one where all the Links are much more distinctly different
[3:48:51] <%Ninestempest> >you pick falco instead
[3:48:52] <%Ninestempest> ??????????????
[3:49:02] <%BoxNavy> fox and falco are completely different
[3:49:04] <unclecreepy18> @woolieversus off topic, which would win a crocodile or bear?
[3:49:07] <%Ninestempest> You wut m8
[3:49:09] <SomersaultJustice> Pac Attack!
[3:49:12] <BestTeaMaker> no, he's right
[3:49:12] <+HyperCharge_Sam> just call them echo fighters and it's all fine
[3:49:20] <BestTeaMaker> Larry Lurr mains all 3 spacies for this reason
[3:49:30] <BestTeaMaker> he's a Fox main still, but he will pull out Falco/Wolf
[3:49:33] <BestTeaMaker> for matchups
[3:49:34] <majindusto> K ROOL is my MAIN
[3:49:38] <%Ninestempest> I think Z meant Wolf, not Falco
[3:49:43] <%Ninestempest> since Wolf has a kill throw
[3:49:44] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @unclecreepy18 probably the bear, both in and out of water. depends on the size of the crocodile and if it gets the bear by surprise tho
[3:49:52] <BestTeaMaker> oh, kill throw sure
[3:49:57] <%Ninestempest> but the spacies are all super different lol

[3:50:18] <BestTeaMaker> they're different sure, but not so much that you can't transition between them
[3:50:38] <BestTeaMaker> and in a game with 70 characters and a ton of matchups, having that kind of training is nice
[3:50:43] <%Ninestempest> it is

[3:57:57] <+StrawberryPantsu> Ness can camp on the gun
[3:57:58] <+spawnzie> yes it is
[3:57:58] <+Joestar_SSB> It's in the game
[3:57:59] <+KilogramHours> CORNERIA IS IN
[3:58:00] <Zasne> lol it is
[3:58:00] <extradopeness> ROB DTILT doodYelp
[3:58:02] <majindusto> IT IS
[3:58:03] <MikanDaiGurren> Corneria and Venom are both in lmao
[3:58:03] <wal__rus> it shouldnt be legal
[3:58:04] <+Nobrev> @WoolieVersus every stage from the old games is in iirc
[3:58:04] <fireking900> it is ALL Stages are in this game
[3:58:06] <AFoolishPaper> pat isnt even here guys
[3:58:06] <SomersaultJustice> it's super in
[3:58:11] <Sielas> Smash competitive rules DansGame
[3:58:11] <+Xeno351> it has the huge back wall that you can camp
[3:58:11] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus you can't turn off the "get fucked" corner by the engines
[3:58:18] <%wujak> at least ness has wall infinites in this game, so no wall stages
[3:58:19] <odd_slater> All but Pokefloats PepeHands
[3:58:20] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @fireking900 no pokefloats FeelsBadMan
[3:58:22] <majindusto> IT IS INDEED IN ULTIMATE
[3:58:30] <maverickdrifter> Everyone is here
[3:58:30] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:58:30] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus R.O.B. is actually high tier in this game.
[3:58:34] <+Story_Ark> you can just grab, back throw, and win
[3:58:35] <%Ninestempest> @WoolieVersus IT IS IN ULTIMATE AND HAS WALLS
[3:58:36] <%BoxNavy> you can camp at the blast zone and throw
[3:58:50] <majindusto> Pokefloats BibleThump
[3:59:01] <fireking900> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug someone one made it but it aint the same FeelsBadMan
[3:59:18] <TheGershon> Well it removes the entire off-stage aspect of gameplay
[3:59:20] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus It just creates unfun gameplay
[3:59:23] <squirtkitten> well just do what i did in for honour when they would just sit next to a ledge all match, just wait them out and run down the clock so they look like a clown
[3:59:37] <%Ninestempest> it's unfun 50/50 moves suddenly deciding a stock
[3:59:58] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus 100%
[3:59:58] <%Ninestempest> It's also a holdover from melee when you could waveshine people off the level, or chain grab peopel off the level
[4:00:00] <+sandwichtaker> Pacland should be legal
[4:00:01] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @woolieversus getting a grab on a walkoff only takes one grab while countering with an aerial is probably gonna lose and takes a lot more percentage
[4:06:24] <wal__rus> plup used to play him a lot
[4:06:34] <majindusto> K ROOL & RIDLEY...BEST FRIENDS!!!
[4:06:38] <squirtkitten> @GohanEgret Because they were on the DS, the only two DQ games i own are 8 and 11 because theyre on console

[4:09:05] <brows_> @capta1n_h3nry all an analog stick is just two rotary/slide potentiometers for the x & y- axis. The voltage changes with each movement of the stick. Also the resources for the Seimitsu LS-64 is available online. And you can 3D print the parts for the stick, which are available on thingiverse.

[4:17:48] <+DatLatinoGuy> FOR ONE GAME

[4:18:08] <@Menitta> Unless they lowered it on current gen
[4:18:09] <+DatLatinoGuy> I think it's on special for 20$ atm
[4:18:18] <+DatLatinoGuy> the whole collection
[4:18:19] <+R_BChe> capcom is just helping u guys not buy DMC2 on switch Kappa
[4:18:19] <+botchdogg> 30 at launch, now it's usually 20
[4:18:20] <Polarix64> Literally no one will pay 30 dollars for DMC 2 on Switch separately
