[0:01:36] <%RioGascar> In 2004
[0:01:40] <%barkon345> people used to upload whole movies and tv shows for free
[0:01:45] <%Jetzord> @Zanco23 Y'toub I think
[0:01:47] <+Zouledge> @chaoko99 Already got it
[0:01:49] <%Gruhunchously> We might want to play this next planet super light side to make up for some of the light laters we did.
[0:01:50] <Doodle_Taco> THERE IS NO TIME
[0:01:55] <Chaoko99> BUY IT AGAIN @Zouledge

[0:02:53] <%perfectsalami> perfectsalami gifted a Tier 1 sub to MrRabbles!
[0:03:06] <%DatAsuna> Soldier on
[0:03:08] <%ChoculaUltra> V’s hair is so smooth it looks like he’s wearing a hooded robe
[0:03:10] <%perfectsalami> needed to round the number out
[0:03:12] <TheFramedWarlock> Poooound KAPOW @zouledge
[0:03:15] <+kikanshat0masu> What planet are we on
[0:03:24] <+Zouledge> Wiki diving is fine,especially since I’m poor af doodLUL
[0:03:27] <jorniev> yeeah
[0:03:28] <%DatAsuna> Speaking of clone wars you're gonna have to finish all of it and rebels to understand mando season 2
[0:03:30] <%jiggy_snipe> yea
[0:03:32] <+prime_name> I'm the same way
[0:03:32] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah same
[0:03:35] <%StaceMcGate> @kikanshat0masu We got two left, either Korriban or Dantooine
[0:03:39] <+Freeborg1997> Clone Wars is mostly filler though, so you're all good.
[0:03:40] <%RioGascar> Btw woolie are you gonna watch all seasons of clone wars or finish s6 and go to rebels?
[0:03:42] <+kikanshat0masu> Thanks
[0:03:44] <%optimasmaximas> fhow can you get the full grasp if you're not paying full attention?
[0:03:46] <%jiggy_snipe> why would you not focus on it?
[0:03:54] <+Zouledge> Same
[0:03:58] <jorniev> I don't now who can do that
[0:04:02] <%RioGascar> i would recommend doing all seasons of clone wars and if you want then do rebels
[0:04:19] <%Irridium> personally I like saving Korriban for last
[0:04:21] <%jiggy_snipe> people who tend to miss stuff Kappa
[0:04:32] <%derap41> ah reddit
[0:04:47] <jorniev> HK gets robbed
[0:04:52] <+Zouledge> @riogascar Lot of people don’t like rebels but Imo it has good points even not as high as clone wars
[0:05:08] <%wunp_fxs> ue5 is interesting but i dont trust it until i see an actual game
[0:05:08] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:05:15] <jorniev> rebels high points are really good
[0:05:17] <%StaceMcGate> The good news is 3 hours on the ebon hawk for LORE is near the end
[0:05:18] <%perfectsalami> My main reason for not watching rebels is the art style
[0:05:25] <%perfectsalami> have you seen what they did to yoda
[0:05:34] <TheFramedWarlock> Same, I don't wanna watch clone wars because it looks really bad imo
[0:05:54] <%DatAsuna> creative cloud sucks
[0:05:57] <%ggbhtg> Yarr, you assholes
[0:06:01] <gypsystranger> hey just finished the first vod have they started the game yet?
[0:06:06] <%wunp_fxs> fuck Adobe so hard
[0:06:09] <gammongaming11> preach brother
[0:06:13] <+Zouledge> @perfectsalami Yeah some chi staffers get ifffy with that style, luckily Yoda dosent appear all that much
[0:06:15] <%DatAsuna> Remember when everyone abadoned final cut to go to adobe?
[0:06:16] <%StaceMcGate> Rebels is a massive downgrade from the final seasons of Clone Wars. Clone Wars had a rough 1st season, but Rebels is OOF
[0:06:19] <%Jetzord> Adobe is a piece of shit
[0:06:22] <%DatAsuna> And now people are ditching adobe for final cut. lol
[0:06:23] <%derap41> We have a monopoly
[0:06:29] <Doodle_Taco> They went to the dark side
[0:06:37] <Chaoko99> Whoever decided that your canvas should shooot out from under you if you approach the edge of the canvas while drawing Needs to die
[0:06:37] <%tearfuldevil> seriously, either YARR HARR or use Adobe Alternatives
[0:06:41] <%derap41> They aren't even fighting it anymore
[0:06:54] <rubbishbinge> Photoshop as a subscription is a wild concept
[0:06:54] <Chaoko99> Titanfall 2 is 3 bucks rn go forth
[0:06:58] <%vorpalswordable> Yay! I love shitting on Adobe.
[0:07:03] <CrmznOgre> I want to see that court case
[0:07:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> How dare you own old product when we demand you rent new service instead? LITERALLY A CRIME AGAINST THE INVISIBLE HAND! REEEEEE!
[0:07:12] <%perfectsalami> How do you get different colored text?
[0:07:20] <%Irridium> a shame there's no way to acquire old versions Kappa
[0:07:24] <%RioGascar> as a student i just get the shit for free
[0:07:29] <%DatAsuna> When i first started video editing I did imovie, until it suffered the same fate in updates
[0:07:31] <jorniev> avid is way better...so I'm told
[0:07:41] <%RioGascar> And yes adobe is being shit BUT AUTODESK IS BEING ASSHOLES
[0:07:42] <%tearfuldevil> use libreoffice or openoffice instead of actual Microsoft Office, use ????? instead of Adobe
[0:07:45] <%ggbhtg> This is the part where someone posts those alternatives to Adobe programs, in the same color breakdown as each Adobe prog
[0:07:53] <arkv01> D: WoolieVS confessionals
[0:07:55] <+Freeborg1997> Confession! Where are the authorities?
[0:08:02] <CrmznOgre> It is illegal to not have internet
[0:08:09] <%DatAsuna> This is 300% relatable rn lol
[0:08:10] <%tearfuldevil> @ggbhtg yeah if anyone with link permissions has that, link it please
[0:08:14] <%DatAsuna> I miss student licenses
[0:08:18] <Carpediem0> who is the guest?
[0:08:30] <%derap41> That's called Malware
[0:08:32] <+Zouledge> Legit question do you guys know of any good alternatives to adobe ?
[0:08:36] <zocano> Gotta go into the RegEdit and kill that shit that way probably
[0:08:36] <+oldneckbeard> @WoolieVersus is apple still preffered for creative programs?
[0:08:42] <%RioGascar> Gimp
[0:08:43] <gammongaming11> so are they using vegas instead?
[0:08:50] <%subjectg> see: matlab, having no suitable alternatives for when you need to read serial input
[0:08:53] <%RioGascar> Sony vegas for video editing
[0:09:05] <%RioGascar> I think theres a new one called zbrush
[0:09:05] <vulkan_vibes> matlab is a monopoly for sure
[0:09:06] <jorniev> WHAT NEXT if you do not buy or program we will see you
[0:09:15] <CageRedfield> !uptime
[0:09:15] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 26 minutes and 11 seconds
[0:09:17] <jorniev> in court
[0:09:29] <%correctedsun117> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:09:33] <vulkan_vibes> wolfram alpha has some kind of matlab version. it's weird
[0:09:37] <%DatAsuna> I assume he meant not highly enough
[0:09:54] <%ggbhtg> If I were able to post links, this is where I'd post this
[0:09:55] <%ggbhtg> https://twitter.com/everblue_comic/status/1128043039971086336
[0:10:01] <+oldneckbeard> most of them are just morons
[0:10:01] <%PanGnollofPower> fabulousgaybear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[0:10:04] <%DatAsuna> The jedi are still the good guys
[0:10:10] <jorniev> the exile is THE BEST jedi
[0:10:14] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus the KOTOR comics are pretty good. They're set pre KOTOR 1, before and during the Mandalorian War, following some rando padawan
[0:10:15] <Doodle_Taco> Expanding a binary system is always cool
[0:10:20] <%DatAsuna> We can't all be sargon saying the sith were right
[0:10:21] <zocano> A lot of it is a response to the Prequel Jedi
[0:10:26] <Chaoko99> and full of assholes
[0:10:27] <vulkan_vibes> most of the star wars universe requires being selfish to survive
[0:10:28] <Jaku2011> The Jedi being so flawed makes them more interesting IMO
[0:10:30] <%subjectg> the jedi as a concept exist, but the execution of that concept in-universe is... not the best
[0:10:34] <%ggbhtg> If that link actually worked, that'd be the pic with all the Adobe program alternatives
[0:10:41] <CrmznOgre> It would be interesting if we get the og jedi and sith with the lightsaber backpacks and the magic blood swords.
[0:10:43] <%correctedsun117> Good can be boring when's that all you are, and most Jedi don't have the nuance of Luke or Obi Wan
[0:10:58] <vulkan_vibes> star wars universe is brutal af for normal peasants
[0:11:06] <vulkan_vibes> hence...wars
[0:11:07] <%Irridium> Obi Wan and Ventress totally fucked
[0:11:09] <jorniev> BEING GOOD IS GOOD
[0:11:09] <CrmznOgre> It would be interesting if we get a game the og jedi and sith with the lightsaber backpacks and the magic blood swords.
[0:11:12] <darwood_> talk about how Darth Vader is cool
[0:11:15] <%subjectg> i really like the exploration of jedi doctrine and its failings though
[0:11:22] <%DatAsuna> Highlights can be provided
[0:11:25] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus its one thing to pick apart how evil Nazi German and Soviet Russia were, its another thing to pick apparently the hypocritical idealology of the otherwise heroic Allies
[0:11:35] <%DatAsuna> That's fine
[0:11:40] <zocano> I'm downloading SWTOR right now to finish up the class stories I didn't do before NotLikeThis
[0:11:41] <%Chatterbox1991> apart*
[0:11:43] <%ggbhtg> time is limited
[0:11:43] <%Ashenik1> What? In the second movie Yoda warned Luke not to go for a Vader bait, but he didnt listen an barerly survived ;d
[0:11:43] <%DatAsuna> Wookiepedia is a fun afternoon
[0:11:47] <%tearfuldevil> which books though?
[0:11:47] <%bigmacjack12> Without giving away big big spoilers, the comics show the dangers of leaving SOME jedi to their own devices
[0:11:59] <%tearfuldevil> the KOTOR comics are pretty good. They're set pre KOTOR 1, before and during the Mandalorian War, following some rando padawan
[0:11:59] <vulkan_vibes> @woolieversus the heir to the empire trilogy is the peak of old EU
[0:12:22] <%DatAsuna> BUT SAND
[0:12:23] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:12:23] <zocano> And by new shit you mean old shit
[0:12:23] <%tearfuldevil> @vulkan_vibes in that its icnredibly overhyped
[0:12:28] <rubbishbinge> Is blood pool at $4k yet?
[0:12:39] <Chaoko99> hey titanfall 2 collectors edition is 3 bucks American on Origin. Buy it. Please. I need people to play against.
[0:12:52] <%Ashenik1> Maul just looks uuuuuuuu EVIL RACE
[0:12:53] <Chaoko99> and that's the last I'll talk of it the rest of the stream
[0:12:54] <+evbites> just in time
[0:12:57] <+SolidusRex> Woolie, it won't be just aesthetic once you watch more Clone Wars. Maul is legit good there
[0:13:02] <%phatmac16> Clone Wars Maul is top tier
[0:13:03] <%Irridium> god I hope EA brings Titanfall 2 to steam. Imagine it. People actually playing Titanfall 2 on PC
[0:13:04] <+SarcFa> @Ashenik1 and yoda also told him to not go try and rescue his friends in ep 5, but doing that let him learn that vader = his father, and gave him motivation to try to redeem vader in 6
[0:13:04] <Doodle_Taco> Samurai robots are cool
[0:13:09] <+jimmyboomjenkins> But but Vader bad because of prequels
[0:13:09] <vulkan_vibes> it gave us thrawn. this alone makes it prime.
[0:13:10] <TheFramedWarlock> But how can you enjoy Vader when Anakin exists ? Kappa
[0:13:10] <%Malik1002> hearing more about revan moves him up to me personally
[0:13:10] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Palpatine will always be my boy. Gonna pretend RoS doesn't exist
[0:13:12] <%optimasmaximas> YEYEYYEYE
[0:13:12] <%StaceMcGate> YEYEYE
[0:13:16] <Chaoko99> @Irridium It straight up is the fucking steam tax right
[0:13:16] <Augus7717> PogChamp
[0:13:17] <StarlitStunner> Dark Wizard Space Samurai is a strong aesthetic
[0:13:17] <rubbishbinge> noice

[0:13:21] <%derap41> That is money people would murder over
[0:13:23] <%Jetzord> BIG MONEY MATCHES
[0:13:26] <CrmznOgre> Maul's like that emo song that you loved as a kid, but still love it as an adult
[0:13:27] <%ChoculaUltra> Oh lord
[0:13:29] <lotharrio> Wait what's it at?
[0:13:31] <zocano> kill minh
[0:13:31] <damienlunas> how much did he say it is?
[0:13:34] <zocano> make it easier
[0:13:34] <%fuji_92> oh fuck
[0:13:34] <%ekodrop> Sorry Woolie...
[0:13:39] <%RioGascar> 4,000$
[0:13:39] <vulkan_vibes> revan is what evil looks like when it's smart.
[0:13:40] <%Jetzord> More than Joe Exotic would pay a hitman for
[0:13:40] <zipperdude33> Dear god
[0:13:42] <%RioGascar> jesus
[0:13:43] <%optimasmaximas> @lotharrio 4k
[0:13:43] <cipher758> blood everywhere.
[0:13:43] <%ChoculaUltra> That’s so much blood money.
[0:13:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE BLOOD WILL SPILL
[0:13:45] <%DianaTheAscian> hows it feel to lose 4k?
[0:13:45] <arkv01> holy shshh
[0:13:46] <Doodle_Taco> I would legit consider hustles for that
[0:13:47] <DonatelloJose> Someone gonna hey SHOT
[0:13:48] <%subjectg> Someone’s gonna die
[0:13:50] <%deviljhojho_> finish the tought baby
[0:13:50] <lotharrio> ...damn, that's a downpayment on something big.
[0:13:52] <%Gruhunchously> New planet smell
[0:14:06] <%bigmacjack12> YEYEYEYEYYE
[0:14:08] <darwood_> i agree with V
[0:14:09] <vulkan_vibes> give us....the backwaters
[0:14:09] <%Jetzord> That's more than a downpayment on a car
[0:14:13] <+evbites> Angry Cyborg Zombie
[0:14:15] <%Ashenik1> @SarcFa so he survived becasue Vader went soft on him.
[0:14:16] <%bigmacjack12> 4K LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO
[0:14:17] <Jaku2011> I'm not caught up on Dokapon did Reggie ever get out of the hole he dug himself
[0:14:19] <%DatAsuna> Iconic, but not ubisoft iconic
[0:14:31] <+oldneckbeard> like moldy burnt toast
[0:14:32] <%RioGascar> i reallt wanna know who came up with the breathing idea
[0:14:34] <%perfectsalami> smells like rotten fish and burnt SIMP in there
[0:14:37] <teamzackattack> smelliest sith is best sith
[0:14:38] <DonatelloJose> that’s why pat hates him
[0:14:42] <%optimasmaximas> psaBig
[0:14:45] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus you need to make the Darkling hailmary play,Minh Must Not Win
[0:14:45] <vulkan_vibes> not much restored content on this next planet
[0:14:46] <%subjectg> Vader is cool, but i always considered him on the weaker end of the power scale, so the constant escalation of power is off to me
[0:14:47] <NeakGX> bIG numBERs
[0:14:53] <darwood_> i have a new planet smell air freshener in my truck
[0:14:57] <Thepothero> BIG combo
[0:15:00] <DonatelloJose> DO NUMBER
[0:15:00] <CrypticMochi> Would he smell worse than Sion?
[0:15:04] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus I would advise we go super light side for this next planet.
[0:15:05] <%phatmac16> DO COMBO FOREVER
[0:15:18] <vulkan_vibes> hasn't the power of force users been creeping down? KREIA says as much.
[0:15:23] <+evbites> i assume vader smells like fire
[0:15:23] <TheFramedWarlock> Vader is at the top of the power scale canonically
[0:15:37] <%Irridium> could pick up some certain mando's in a certain room
[0:15:52] <TheFramedWarlock> But comics have to show cooler and cooler stuff so other Sith seem stronger
[0:15:59] <%GrassCannon> Can't go to that one city, guess the whole planet's off limits Kappa
[0:16:01] <%DatAsuna> And lots of farms
[0:16:14] <Chaoko99> hey chat answer a question for me
[0:16:20] <Chaoko99> Should I make white gravy beef rice again
[0:16:24] <eliudfs1> Figures, Korriban is great, but I understand why going to Dantoine first.
[0:16:24] <%Irridium> yes
[0:16:25] <%perfectsalami> yes
[0:16:27] <Chaoko99> It was good but I wanna do it right
[0:16:30] <Doodle_Taco> yes
[0:16:33] <%Jetzord> Yes, do it
[0:16:34] <%DatAsuna> Korriban don'trhymes with morraband
[0:16:34] <%tearfuldevil> 14 months
[0:16:36] <%Gruhunchously> It's like poetry
[0:16:38] <%ChoculaUltra> “Exogol”
[0:16:53] <jorniev> maybe they did it first
[0:16:54] <+ChrisAlgoo> force is stored in the exogols
[0:16:55] <%DatAsuna> Exalol
[0:16:57] <Augus7717> BECAUSE MONEY (talent)
[0:17:00] <damienlunas> happy little trees
[0:17:01] <%RioGascar> Could also be better render???
[0:17:09] <%Gruhunchously> Welcome back to Dantooine
[0:17:10] <+xShenzi> Man i don't like dantooine
[0:17:19] <jorniev> THIS is whe my memory of this game dies
[0:17:19] <+evbites> it got spoloded
[0:17:29] <+RJay80> dusted
[0:17:30] <%Gruhunchously> He blowed it up
[0:17:30] <zocano> It happens off screen
[0:17:31] <%subjectg> @vulkan_vibes there’s a line later where she mentions that old sith lords were much more powerful than now, and i’ve always liked the idea that the jedi we see in the movies are a far cry from times old
[0:17:34] <%DatAsuna> It was told but not shown
[0:17:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> HE DID THE BIG FUCK
[0:17:36] <%Jetzord> Malek tried a magic trick with it
[0:17:44] <%RioGascar> I remember as a kid thinking he lied
[0:17:47] <+evbites> orbital laser on the temple
[0:17:51] <%RioGascar> then i played kotor 2
[0:18:10] <%Gruhunchously> You might want to put your lightsaber away
[0:18:11] <+evbites> space cloth
[0:18:11] <%GrassCannon> armor plates?
[0:18:13] <zocano> Ya the way it comes off in conversation makes it seem like a lie
[0:18:15] <Dangerzone979> The Ol' Malak Method: Bomb that shit from orbit like a coward
[0:18:16] <+MidnightBurst12> layered scales?
[0:18:20] <rubbishbinge> probably fetish leather
[0:18:24] <%Zebroneath> The planet didn't get glassed or anything
[0:18:25] <%subjectg> it’s like scales
[0:18:25] <zocano> Cause it feels like a thing they'd show
[0:18:29] <%caffienatedjedi> !uptime

[0:33:36] <%DatAsuna> The flip cards are great
[0:33:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:33:49] <%DatAsuna> It can make HUGE minuses
[0:33:57] <zocano> ya the flip cards are strong
[0:34:03] <%subjectg> they’re for very niche situations though
[0:34:09] <lotharrio> It can CRAZY change things.
[0:34:12] <%RioGascar> Wow that can blow your ass up
[0:34:26] <%Jetzord> It's super subjective but if the situation comes up it's great
[0:34:26] <%subjectg> i prefer consistency of +-
[0:34:33] <toffshelf55> Just joined, Is this the pazak stream!!!
[0:35:01] <Maleicus> Its funny when someone used the flipcard on them they called it cheating LUL
[0:35:20] <jaygee303> Does V arrive in the robe or does he put it on before stream
[0:35:24] <+Zouledge> They should make irl pazak playing cards doodLUL
[0:35:27] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Flip cards are valuable because they invery 2 and 4s into -2s and -4s, making it easier to not go broke, or to win by a 9 card streak
[0:35:30] <damienlunas> I prefer Big Minus
[0:35:32] <NeakGX> it's time to p-p-p-p p-p-p-p-pazak
[0:35:54] <%subjectg> Take out the +-1 and use sumthin else
[0:35:58] <Augus7717> LUL
[0:36:04] <%DatAsuna> USE THE FLIP
[0:36:08] <toffshelf55> Blue Eyes White +-6
[0:36:09] <%RioGascar> Huh
[0:36:26] <%RioGascar> Or you could have used that flip
[0:36:28] <darwood_> V lives in the robe
[0:36:29] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Flip cards INVERT 2s and 4s, instead of swithcing the,. It makes them minuses
[0:36:35] <+Jasuchin> I play with all reds and bluereds, except for a single doubler card
[0:36:40] <$xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I think they believe that the flip turns 2's to 4's and vice versa
[0:36:48] <%Ashenik1> what does 2&4 do?
[0:36:50] <Maleicus> Flip cards take away the cards they flip and subtract that amount
[0:36:55] <+Deano8817> PAZAAK VERGIL

[0:37:56] <%jaytitan96> LOL
[0:38:00] <+TheOneCalledRock> LUL
[0:38:02] <%Gruhunchously> It flips it to a negative, not a 2
[0:38:04] <DestroyerPhoenix> we figured it out bois
[0:38:04] <%DatAsuna> It's way stronger than you think
[0:38:12] <snakemuho> Now the real pazaak begins.
[0:38:12] <%Irridium> Pazaak has changed
[0:38:14] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Also drawing 9 cards without going bust beats a 20
[0:38:16] <TheLennster> LOOOOOL
[0:38:17] <Jaku2011> Easy Pazaak has been unlocked
[0:38:18] <%subjectg> it’s still pretty damn niche

[0:41:50] <+Jasuchin> I NEVER saw a 17 stand win
[0:41:54] <DestroyerPhoenix> NotLikeThis

[0:44:07] <%Gruhunchously> Observation: Master, this Ithorian meatbag is clearly playing Pazaak fraudulently. This could be interpreted as an act of agression.
[0:44:08] <%Ashenik1> I need to check if it is rigged
[0:44:14] <%phatmac16> he's just playing against Yami

[0:45:29] <%fuji_92> You can (NOT) win the first turn
[0:45:30] <+pyrojack6> strategic loss
[0:45:32] <%GraceTBM> use the 2 4 and 3 6 cards to fuck up his play @WoolieVersus
[0:45:38] <%RioGascar> Im curious, what number do you both stand at if you play blackjack in a casino?
[0:45:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[0:45:53] <%DatAsuna> 17 always
[0:45:55] <+griffball13> real pazzak hours
[0:45:56] <%GraceTBM> 21 rio
[0:46:12] <zocano> big cheats
[0:46:13] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 18+2
[0:46:17] <%RioGascar> I usually stand at 13 or 14
[0:46:23] <lotharrio> ROLL FOR THE 1!
[0:46:23] <skeith77> PogChamp PogChamp
[0:46:29] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus the reverse 2 and 4 and other reverse cards can ruin his stand after he's played
[0:46:31] <%DatAsuna> If you had put the -2 you would had auto won
[0:46:33] <%RioGascar> Cause my hand usually starts at 7 or 8 and then i add on
[0:46:33] <+pyrojack6> jeez
[0:46:34] <%therabbles> its unfair that you go first
[0:46:41] <%DatAsuna> Because filling the 9 slots ALWAYS beats 20
[0:46:46] <infinite_rotation> 18 to 20 for me
[0:46:50] <%GraceTBM> Use the fancy cards to fuck with him
[0:46:52] <ralphfromdk> What armor mod is it even that we are playing for? O.o

[0:50:09] <%DatAsuna> This is when you meet that guy at the arcades you can't beat and all you want it to take ONE win off him
[0:50:10] <%Gruhunchously> This is going to be the entire stream, and I can't even complain.
[0:50:11] <%Ashenik1> classic RPGC strategy - save and load
[0:50:14] <shincadad> Nagito the system
[0:50:15] <%RioGascar> and then the casino beats the shit out of you for counting cards
[0:50:15] <silver__viii> T3 canonically counts cards, send in the boy!
[0:50:17] <+Freeborg1997> People always say deal with the hand you've been dealt. I disagree.

[0:50:35] <%DatAsuna> You built card advantage
[0:50:35] <%subjectg> My way of thinking is that you have more chances to predict a 20 through + cards than through - cards
[0:50:35] <%Gruhunchously> Darth Sion, Darth Nihilus, nah...THIS GUY is the true antagonist of the game.
[0:50:45] <+oda_flobunaga> The more you loose to him the more you need to win back

[1:15:12] <%tearfuldevil> i mean, ill be honest "go kill yourself" has always been, uh, kinda edgy, and if someone who had been perosnally affected by suicide i'd get it

[1:16:28] <%subjectg> I know a guy who tried converting pazaak to android

[1:16:43] <%DatAsuna> There's like 4 pazaak android games.
[1:16:43] <shincadad> 20% levels 80% pazaak
[1:16:55] <%ChoculaUltra> but there's been a large outcry for it since the game launched, and seeing as they added pod racing just recently things look hopeful!

[1:18:48] <+Freeborg1997> Jolee's philosophy is stupid in later conversations when you learn the only reason he left the jedi is because they didn't punish him.
[1:18:53] <%DatAsuna> Not browser, but pc MP

[1:21:37] <%subjectg> to be fair, they weren’t doing much about those mandalorian raiders back in kotor 1
[1:21:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> Heard you were talking shit!

[1:22:24] <+Jasuchin> Keep a good vibrosword on you I guess
[1:22:30] <%tearfuldevil> @Jetzord i eman, they did get help = they sent a padawan (Reven) to do it
