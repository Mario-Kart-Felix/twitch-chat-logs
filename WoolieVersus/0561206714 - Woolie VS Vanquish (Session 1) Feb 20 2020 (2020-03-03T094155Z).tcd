[0:13:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> capcuck are fucking pathetic man...
[0:13:08] <%Irridium> A lot of headaches could have been prevented if Capcom released patch notes beyond "we made some changes"
[0:13:25] <%Sparkseid> @irridium absolutely
[0:13:31] <mr_miyagucci> I mean it is a bit better but more work needs to be done but they acknowledged the big post about it so hopefully the future is better

[0:25:17] <JudgeDAN> Holy shit yes vanquish!
[0:25:18] <jorniev> the only thing i can se this game improving is if somehow they added verticallity
[0:25:21] <@Menitta> Vanquish isn't on Switch. but if it WAS you KNOW thered be a Varia suit skin
[0:25:27] <kevinwager> @SliverFaustX fuck the new Xbox and PS4 there with that Cloud gaming stuff
[0:25:28] <Morning_Asakura> woolie with good tips
[0:25:29] <%DatAsuna> BUT only if it had full ammo. So you can't upgrade when you have less than full
[0:25:33] <%ozzrabbit> I'm a big fan of both the "transforming weapon" and the "evolving weapon" tropes
[0:25:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> i love when weapons have multiple forms

[0:45:51] <%augusm> Did you know that Woolie can lose a limb and still be 95% combat effective?
[0:45:52] <%RioGascar> that is a dark quote

[0:47:00] <Xeroflame> use the pistol
[0:47:00] <Jalexster> Because this includes all the DLC
[0:47:00] <+Worsel5> Big tip is to go crazy and dont play it like Gears of War for anyone playing the first time. it's a blast
[0:47:01] <absolute_cagemony> If Woolie is gonna play more shooters, he needs to think of a title for it
[0:47:03] <Solidnick18> uh oh

[0:47:05] <Tucker0603> BOOST MACHINE GUN

[0:49:11] <stranger59> This is the most hype colorblind LP on twitch
[0:49:11] <Tucker0603> WELL THIS IS BAD
[0:49:11] <+TheotherKristian> Oh geez, this is new experience for him. Just shoot the robo-russians
[0:49:13] <%gatorafan> LP OFF TO A GOOD START
[0:49:14] <Toaster_Noodle> That really sucks
[0:49:16] <jarednotwithsubway> !EYES AT RISK!
[0:49:17] <+tankusmaximus7> Oh dear
[0:49:17] <+huggablemantooth> coloblind??
[0:49:22] <kevinwager> he color blind?
[0:49:22] <Solidnick18> this gonna be something
[0:49:23] <FairOnFire> enemies are all robots though
[0:49:23] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm colourblind and I have a real fucking hard time with Vanquish
[0:49:24] <+huggablemantooth> color*
[0:49:24] <vVAstrAVv> maybe Reggie should play lol
[0:49:24] <Teh10sorrow> Oh right Min is legit colorblind when it comes to red
[0:49:24] <stranger59> Are there colorblind options on this?
[0:49:25] <wotebi> off to a bad start
[0:49:30] <gordieda20> uh oh
[0:49:30] <brunoberserk> OOF
[0:49:33] <Jathspuh> good luck minh! atpQuan
[0:49:33] <Xeroflame> that sucks bro
[0:49:35] <jarednotwithsubway> Minh is in fact red green colorblind
[0:49:35] <Solidus0101> Minheggan in full effect
[0:49:36] <+TheotherKristian> Robots=Communists
[0:49:36] <Teh10sorrow> This is going to be AAAAAAAAAMAZING with him murdering friendlies
[0:49:37] <Toaster_Noodle> That is a pretty big thing too
[0:49:39] <%gatorafan> Everyone is an enemy to Minh
[0:49:39] <absolute_cagemony> Of to a rollicking good start!
[0:49:40] <dmc5nero> wait your really colorbliind?
[0:49:43] <%linSP> minh is blind to communism!
[0:49:44] <thesoothe> Coloblindness didn't exist for the PS3 /Xbox 360 era.
[0:49:45] <Zebroneath> Minh is colorblind to certain colors
[0:49:50] <donstylo> Here is the Deal, every Weapon has a military Rank, like Sergeant. Everytime you pick up the same weapon your weapon gets a new rank, only if you have full ammo, otherwise it only fills your ammo. Picking up the same weapons is basicly the upgradesystem. If you die your weapons lose ranks.
[0:49:59] <dmc5nero> what game has color blind options?
[0:50:03] <+mickers> shame u cant choose retical colours
[0:50:03] <zamzoph> Woolie and Reggie are going to have to be Minh's spotters
[0:50:05] <joylent_blue> a game nowadays would maybe have an option but not, what, '09? LUL
[0:50:16] <%Ipsenscastle> @dmc5nero lots have since around 2010
[0:50:18] <kevinwager> u better pay for those Google 4k glasses
[0:50:24] <nothuzad> but colorblindness doesnt take away hue so the enemies should still be identifieable by shape (well after a few minutes)
[0:50:29] <+Worsel5> Daemon X Machina is my worst nightmare, no colorblind options and I cant see ANYTHING in that game
[0:50:33] <vVAstrAVv> do weapon ranks reset each level?
[0:50:33] <katocrimson> There's a company that make color blind corrective glasses
[0:50:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> this came out in 2010
[0:50:44] <Tucker0603> heal the dudes
[0:50:45] <masterfire23> colorblind to certain colors cmonBruh
[0:50:53] <+TheotherKristian> No there's friendly fire
[0:50:56] <dmc5nero> literally the 10th anniversary
[0:51:00] <+Worsel5> @katocrimson yes and they are pretty expensive :)
[0:51:03] <absolute_cagemony> 2010? wasn't everything black and white back then?
[0:51:16] <nothuzad> absolute_cagemony more like piss filtered
[0:51:20] <%RioGascar> more like grey and brown cover shooter
[0:51:21] <Jathspuh> SSS
[0:51:21] <Valdorick> "That there's no friendly fire" - Blasts 3 of his own guys, who die instantly.
[0:51:26] <pshuuu> age of brown
[0:51:26] <absolute_cagemony> Reggie's favorite. Piss.
[0:51:27] <%Javaa01> It was more piss yellow and brown
[0:51:28] <Andrei11Droasca> This makes me want a Star Wars Platinum game
[0:51:33] <Valdorick> Confirmed Friendly KIAs!
[0:51:36] <+Proxzo> Has Minh tried those special glasses that restore color sight?
[0:51:38] <+RoughyID> Did anyone tell him that picking the same weapons upgrades that wewapon?
[0:51:46] <%RioGascar> Which i dont really like this games color scheme
[0:51:57] <%RioGascar> but its visuals and art direction are solid
[0:51:57] <+mickers> man this is very unfortuante that everything is green/red
[0:52:00] <Malucoblz02> @RoughyID yes it was mentioned
[0:52:03] <dmc5nero> imagine if they made a marvel platinum game that would be awesome
[0:52:07] <+RoughyID> okay nice
[0:52:09] <%gatorafan> I sure hope Minh can see the green/red overheat bar. daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:52:11] <kevinwager> @karldeck then that should be the stream goal hlep him get the glasses to see donashion G
[0:52:21] <+Jaysky> Look to Resident Evil 5's color palette to get an idea of most games colors back in 2010
[0:52:27] <+Proxzo> They sell Chroma Glasses that restore color sight within a certain range.
[0:52:27] <arikk42> OoooOOoOOOooOOoOOoOOF
[0:52:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> the tps genre started with vanquish
[0:52:41] <jarednotwithsubway> @Proxzo but he needs glasses already, he would need contacts, or lenses that are prescription as well as colorblind aiding
[0:52:44] <Jathspuh> strats PogChamp
[0:52:51] <Andrei11Droasca> Chest Lasers coming up woolieYE
[0:52:58] <kevinwager> @proxzo we should donate
[0:52:58] <dmc5nero> that looked like the ripper from dead space
[0:53:01] <+TheotherKristian> That's been retconned. Same speed now for all directions, from when I played it
[0:53:20] <Jathspuh> LUL
[0:53:25] <+Proxzo> I wonder if you could get the Chroma glasses prescription?
[0:53:28] <worldbrand> SO YES
[0:53:29] <+TheotherKristian> nvr mind I'm forgetting
[0:53:30] <dmc5nero> wtf was that?!
[0:53:33] <Malucoblz02> @jarednotwithsubway he could put it over his own, like those movie 3d glasses
[0:53:36] <straycatrock> i loved this game when i played it but also it got just...so hectic i could barely keep up with it
[0:53:45] <jarednotwithsubway> yeah i suppose

[0:54:54] <%RioGascar> 2010 visuals tbf

[1:28:23] <+TheDankDemon> can't wait for the second game Kappa
[1:28:32] <scoopyoopydoo> his name sam too
[1:28:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> @valachi Vanquish 2
[1:28:43] <Jolly_Adventurer> Mutiny Avoided
[1:28:45] <scoopyoopydoo> Platinum hella self inserted their character into metal gear
[1:29:10] <+Psycosis> RELOAD CANCELS?
[1:29:16] <Xeroflame> passive reload
[1:29:19] <jorniev> REALOAD CANCELLING!!!??
[1:29:23] <KnivesEve> is this a non-woolie lp!? nice
[1:29:26] <+RoughyID> woooooow
[1:29:30] <%Taglog7> tech on tech on tech
[1:29:32] <+NotHereToStream> jfc thats a platinum thing
[1:29:32] <scoopyoopydoo> on some source game shit
[1:29:33] <arikk42> I Never Knew That X4
[1:29:41] <%jiggy_snipe> naw with Platinum it's a feature
[1:29:43] <+RoughyID> Didn't know that x4
[1:29:54] <+TheDankDemon> why tho sounds stressful
[1:29:58] <donstylo> A little Detail, you only have one weapon that can copy any other weapon.
[1:30:07] <Xeroflame> do all of it in ar mode
[1:30:35] <Andrei11Droasca> Its like the DMC animation cancels
[1:31:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> animation cancelling is a staple in platinum games. I bet even Infinite Space has cancels too and that's not even an action game
[1:31:06] <%Taglog7> LUL
[1:31:06] <bubblegumcrisis2040> like canceling a long arrack with Royal guard
[1:31:10] <+D00msDayDan> @woolieversus it’s not a reload cancel, switching weapons reloads automatically
[1:31:15] <bubblegumcrisis2040> attack*
[1:31:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:31:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Very cool
[1:31:23] <mr_miyagucci> I think some shooters have stuff like this like cod and speinting to cancel reloads right?
[1:31:31] <absolute_cagemony> If Platinum made an RTS it would have animation cancels
[1:31:35] <astrophizz> reload cancelling is in fps's
[1:31:40] <%Javaa01> CoD has partial reload cancelling
[1:31:46] <astrophizz> counterstrike
[1:31:48] <Manwad> Build queue cancels Pog
[1:31:49] <mr_miyagucci> Ah ok
[1:31:57] <Xeroflame> so then it is a passive reload instead of a cancel
[1:31:59] <Jathspuh> yeah counterstrike
[1:32:00] <%Javaa01> Where basically once the mag hits the gun, you can sprint cancel the reload and it counts
[1:32:08] <DedlokPM> Reaper in Overwatch has (had?) reload canceling
[1:32:11] <eldragon_1> That Steve Blum?
[1:32:25] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:32:27] <DedlokPM> @eldragon_1 yeah
[1:32:35] <bleugh> epic drop PogChamp
[1:32:46] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie doesn't under this RPG Shlooter color stuff Kappa
[1:32:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's like upgrading weapons in something like metal slugs huh
[1:33:04] <+olgaflowen> You guys playing this game reminded me that it came out. Probably one of the better PS3 games that released that went under the radar.
[1:33:08] <%Javaa01> Most characters in Overwatch had reload cancels, Reaper's was just the most powerful one, since it basically cut the reload in half
[1:33:41] <%Taglog7> AMERICA
[1:33:45] <+TheDankDemon> fallout has that LUL
[1:33:53] <Xeroflame> played college ball you know
[1:33:59] <%DatAsuna> Sam was Homo-Football

[1:34:14] <rubbishbinge> those pansy ass politicians don't stand a chance
[1:34:15] <bubblegumcrisis2040> The overheat bar fills up to cool down?
[1:34:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> think of it as an EX meter that refills automatically
[1:34:54] <Tucker0603> glowing eyes are enemies
[1:34:54] <%Irridium> You could also look for the lights on their heads.
[1:35:02] <%Irridium> The ones with the glowing faces = bad
[1:35:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> rip
[1:35:23] <%netrac> does this game have colorblind mode?
[1:35:28] <+Commissar_Rain> ohk :(
[1:35:35] <AngryContrarian> JET SET ANNOUNCEMENT IN AN HOUR
[1:35:36] <%Javaa01> That attack kills from behind low cover
[1:35:41] <vVAstrAVv> I though he dodgesd it for a second
[1:35:47] <bubblegumcrisis2040> it pushed him aside, then aplied damage
[1:36:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> @angrycontrarian huh???? where
[1:36:15] <Xeroflame> yeah what are you talking about
[1:36:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> dont give me hope

[1:36:43] <%RioGascar> Jet set family guy
[1:37:25] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe JSRF for pc
[1:37:48] <valachi> Jet Set games for any modern system would be great at this point

[1:38:38] <Xeroflame> I tried the first Jet Set but I couldnt get into it, I feel like I missed the train for it
[1:38:54] <%RioGascar> i feel we need text under the video to just say MINHS COLOR BLIND
[1:39:13] <%netrac> The first jet set isn't that great
[1:39:24] <%netrac> gameplay wise
[1:39:44] <%RioGascar> Sick
[1:39:46] <+WhereIsWill> JSRF on the switch when
[1:39:50] <EpitaphTransmits> @WoolieVersus You still play mobile games woolie?
[1:39:53] <Xeroflame> is that so? thats unfortunate. the music is pretty godlike tho
[1:39:56] <Jathspuh> i couldn't play past the first 10 minutes of the first jet set
[1:39:58] <DaBigVitus> first jet set is weirdly slow and floaty
[1:40:00] <Jathspuh> too slow
[1:40:27] <Jathspuh> yeah floaty too. forgot about that atpCap
[1:40:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think it was an alright start. definitely not as good as the other extreme sports games out at the time
[1:40:45] <+ZuluKaneda> This game is sick
[1:41:11] <RoboticRexkek> tbf the shooting alone was enough for me
[1:41:12] <eldragon_1> Like chat LUL

[1:46:30] <%ozzrabbit> Kinda hate to be captain obvious here, but doesn't this game have a "Colorblind Mode"? I know this needs to go up on YouTube, but I think viewers would understand.
[1:46:31] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:46:34] <+valiard> is Minh colorblind?

[1:46:46] <KnivesEve> hai
[1:46:48] <+valiard> oof
[1:46:54] <%Irridium> Woolie exploits it for wins
[1:47:04] <fist_wizard_jay> A weakness that has been exploited in many a game
[1:47:40] <%netrac> Did they fix the pc port?

[1:49:24] <nothuzad> ZuluKaneda first few weeks Vanquish ran at double game logic making deaths happen instantly and generally screwing with design
[1:49:25] <%Ashenik1> Good Russian massage
[1:49:28] <%netrac> @ZuluKaneda I remember part of the game logic being tied to FPS dying twice as fast
[1:49:48] <+ZuluKaneda> ohh
[1:49:49] <%netrac> @nothuzad was it fixed?
[1:50:07] <nothuzad> netrac ye I think a few weeks in I just palyed it recently and seemed fine
[1:50:17] <HellishLancer> Man, this game is great
[1:50:29] <Zayasu> BibleThump
[1:50:38] <%Ipsenscastle> the desaturation in this game does it no favours at all, it's so exhausting to look at
[1:50:40] <+DesertPenguin> I missed the beginning, why isn't Woolie playing?
[1:50:40] <%netrac> I'm downloading it to check if it has colorblind mode
[1:50:44] <+RoughyID> I don't understand why that jim sterling guy gave this game a low score
[1:50:49] <corpseweed> i had one scripted event not happen on pc at 60 recently, but other than that i think it's fine
[1:51:24] <nothuzad> RoughyID gmae is pretty unconventional - doesnt really tease the features it has
[1:51:27] <%jiggy_snipe> pimp hand strong
[1:51:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's a 360 game from 2010 I dont think it has colorblind mode
[1:51:38] <%Javaa01> Score bonus basically
[1:51:41] <%HeavyMetalIceCream> @DesertPenguin Because last time Woolie tried to show people Vanquish, people left the room.
[1:51:58] <+DesertPenguin> Wha happun?
[1:52:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieGASM_KI
[1:52:30] <+RoughyID> @nothuzad and just because of that he gave it a low score? seems pretty unreasonable, even though I kinda agree with his criticism on that front.
[1:52:31] <Jathspuh> works on guided missiles too @WoolieVersus
[1:52:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Burns is literally just a Gears character LUL
[1:53:07] <RoboticRexkek> yeah he's mister gow

[1:53:10] <VJdarkworld> tech test PogChamp
[1:53:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> reminds me of the dad from astral chain
[1:53:27] <+RoughyID> Noo he didn't do the upgrade tech
[1:53:46] <Solidnick18> oh i see
[1:53:58] <%netrac> according to a review there are not any colorblind modes
[1:54:01] <%netrac> so that sucks
[1:54:02] <+ZuluKaneda> @RoughyID This is kind of a old school game. You just play it to do good runs and high scores. But speedrun is popular nowadays so I don't know.
[1:54:19] <dmc5nero> this game is so fucking sick in a good way
[1:54:20] <%Javaa01> This is a decade old game, color blind modes were in short supply back then
[1:54:41] <%Javaa01> Color blind options started being more of a thing in like 2013-2014
[1:55:36] <corpseweed> it was re released recently though javaa
[1:55:37] <Tonicky > good old disk launcher
[1:55:41] <%Ipsenscastle> colour blind options took off when CoD:MW2 implemented them
[1:55:46] <stranger59> I think the first game I remember with a colorblind option was Perfect Dark Zero.
[1:55:50] <dmc5nero> if get the same weapon you already got it upgrades the gunn
[1:56:07] <RoboticRexkek> they are quite red
[1:56:16] <%netrac> I mean that sucks as that is unfortunate kinda way
[1:56:20] <+RoughyID> @ZuluKaneda Still doesn't justify the low score, if that's what you're responding to. People were turned off by that score without even playing it.
[1:56:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> please tell the disc launcher goes through enemies
[1:56:39] <nothuzad> they are red but have unique distinguishable designs and he still will see them as other colors/values
[1:56:39] <%Ipsenscastle> The map is useless with R/G colourblindness
[1:56:52] <nothuzad> the map is pretty useless though - agreed
[1:57:15] <+hoenhime344> i REALLY hope mihn keeps with it. this game is awesome
[1:57:23] <stranger59> Vanquish got low scores cause people went in and played it like a normal shooter, standing and shooting, which is boring but can be done.
[1:57:30] <%Javaa01> The first really impressive suite of Colorblind options I saw was back in late 2013 with Battlefield 4, since that started covering the full suite of three common colorblindness variants
[1:57:47] <%Javaa01> And after that, it really started cementing itself across the industry
[1:58:18] <+ZuluKaneda> Disk launcher needed a buff imo CoolStoryBob
[1:58:28] <corpseweed> to be fair this game is also just very visually busy
[1:58:39] <dmc5nero> theres diffrent types of colorblindness?
[1:58:47] <corpseweed> i had a hard time seeing enemies sometimes, especially on a smaller screen
[1:59:36] <%Ipsenscastle> @dmc5nero several, depending on the rods/cones affected in your eyes
[1:59:59] <dmc5nero> wow thats crazy but im sure that sucks
[1:59:59] <%netrac> This game would benefit from a high contrast texture pack
[2:00:01] <bubblegumcrisis2040> Kinda cool going rambo and have your friends calling tango positions
[2:00:07] <+hoenhime344> this is fun

[2:00:15] <%Ipsenscastle> most common is Red Green, makes them look muddy and indistinguishable

[2:02:01] <pshuuu> its jsut fire and forget but low damage
[2:02:21] <+ZuluKaneda> @hoenhime344 Disk launcher can cut the limbs of some enemies
[2:02:23] <+hoenhime344> even at highter levels?
[2:02:28] <+hoenhime344> ah ty
[2:02:44] <dashwallkick> Game: you can only melee once Billy: I don't get it *jacks melee button*

[2:03:36] <+hoenhime344> god this game brings back so many good memories
[2:03:54] <+DullMouse_> Woolie lookin' like Steve from Blue's Clues.
[2:03:57] <Tucker0603> it eats suit energy
[2:03:59] <pshuuu> the melee reducing power to 0 is kinda annoying
[2:04:02] <+hoenhime344> its one of those games where you have to learn how to play. its not just a cover shooter

[2:05:05] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 18 minutes
[2:05:12] <%Ipsenscastle> The fact that melee overheats you always seemed like a bizarre choice to me
[2:05:22] <%netrac> netrac subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[2:05:48] <@Menitta> the Melees should've been a little weaker and not depleted the whole bar
[2:05:55] <+hoenhime344> i like it. melee in shooters is always a 1hit kill for some reason. this gives a viceral feedback and meaningful choice to use it
[2:05:56] <straycatrock> The overheat mechanic was the main thing i couldn't really get to grips with
[2:06:01] <Jathspuh> the whistles go WHOOO
[2:06:06] <straycatrock> like i couldn't split my attention between the game and the overheat gague
[2:06:08] <%Ipsenscastle> Literally anything cool you can do burns your bar, which leaves you spending half your time being lame. If kills/hits restored bar I'd like it much better
[2:06:19] <eldragon_1> I like this literal blind playthrough
[2:06:27] <+therabbles> that mini map sucks ass for how active what's going on in the center is

[2:07:24] <%Javaa01> The Laser Cannon was originally a DLC gun, so that's why it shares the melee attack with the Shotgun
[2:07:33] <biomegabear> I usually keep a heavy and assult and a 3rd for whatever I find
[2:07:34] <vVAstrAVv> the dissapointment in woolies voice lol
[2:07:34] <dmc5nero> it doesnt need to be a desperation move
[2:07:40] <+hoenhime344> but there is already so much packed into this control system to begin with
[2:07:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> maybe like how nioh handles the stamina bar
[2:08:07] <@Menitta> I initially thought you'd get upgrades for your AR meter and how long cooldown would last
[2:08:10] <%netrac> I would make melee maybe recover you from overheat but be slower
[2:08:26] <biomegabear> its the first boss from ape escape
[2:08:32] <Jathspuh> monkaS
[2:08:33] <Zayasu> atpRtsd
[2:08:34] <%Ipsenscastle> Maybe if you got a refill from releasing slow-mo at the right section, like active reload
[2:08:36] <%Javaa01> STOP MASHING
[2:08:39] <+therabbles> activate everything
[2:08:44] <stranger59> Keep on rollin'

[2:10:27] <+ElectricFoxLex> Minh...were you trying to melee the tank?
[2:10:46] <Jathspuh> atpRtsd4
[2:11:01] <%netrac> In platinum game logic punching a tank is sensible
[2:11:01] <+ZuluKaneda> melee the tank in the weak spot is actually good lol
[2:11:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> if Ryu can melee a tank why not
[2:11:13] <$razielhex> sleepin' on Vanquish
[2:11:13] <+JD_Lars> Is Minh color blind?
[2:11:14] <+ZuluKaneda> with the two boots
[2:11:15] <vVAstrAVv> mihns been playing too many rpgs. over here wanting weapon rarities upgrade trees and train punching
[2:11:17] <Jathspuh> PogChamp
[2:11:19] <%Javaa01> But yeah this is basically the first sleep check the game throws at you, cause you best not be caught sleepin
[2:11:19] <+AntithesisEK> lmao
[2:11:25] <+ElectricFoxLex> He tried to melee it while overheat
[2:11:26] <$razielhex> @JD_Lars Minh has protanopia I believe.

[2:11:58] <Tuna_Can_0> *dies* then explodes
[2:11:59] <dmc5nero> jeez minh
[2:12:01] <$razielhex> Protanopia is red.
[2:12:02] <+paladinstarbuster> happens to the best of us
[2:12:05] <+AntithesisEK> ahahah
[2:12:06] <$razielhex> Deuteranopia is greed
[2:12:08] <+steelmorrigan> overconfidence
[2:12:10] <biomegabear> I know red is one of them from the NUNS videos
[2:12:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think red-green
[2:12:13] <+DesertPenguin> There are two types of Deuteranopia. I have both
[2:12:14] <+NotHereToStream> red, there are red barrels and enemy
[2:12:15] <$razielhex> Tritanopia is blue (and not sex-linked)
[2:12:16] <+hoenhime344> i LOVE this. i really hope this becomes the playthrough to watch for the channel
[2:12:19] <BioApple> overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[2:12:28] <vVAstrAVv> red and green apparently
[2:12:28] <+DesertPenguin> Minh has Pro?
[2:12:29] <jorniev> EGO
[2:12:31] <+JD_Lars> I was wondering because Woolie was saying look at the map and I kept thinking that maybe he just doesn’t see it

[2:46:19] <masterfire23> lets jump riiight into it
[2:46:20] <heartlesshealer> Woolie, watch one episode G Gundam, it is the least "teen war drama" Gundam series if you just want mech designs and fun fights
[2:46:28] <+paladinstarbuster> Kappa
[2:46:29] <%xeromage> gone forever
[2:46:33] <sototsiris> sureeeee
[2:46:34] <stranger59> Putin returned to his home planet
[2:46:44] <chronoxgp> g gundam is the perfect after school anime
[2:46:48] <pixel_river> its not an easy game to syle in
[2:46:55] <pixel_river> style*
[2:47:07] <stranger59> I played through the game twice, and I don't think I knew some of this.
[2:47:24] <OkamiDude15> You did better than woolie did in that one story nkoLUL
[2:47:29] <jorniev> first time play + color blind + actually hard game
[2:47:32] <heartlesshealer> I may be wrong on "least teen war drama" because I forgot almost all of SD Gundam until just now
[2:47:59] <Andrei11Droasca> Im curious how dose color blindness even look like ,do you just se like a od greys
[2:48:19] <OkamiDude15> There’s different types of color blind types
[2:48:21] <stranger59> You can look up videos to see what colorblindness looks like, there are different kinds
[2:48:23] <%netrac> There are websites
[2:48:49] <jorniev> minh is just DOING
[2:48:57] <OkamiDude15> Minh:
[2:48:58] <%Ipsenscastle> aww
[2:49:12] <%netrac> Websites for colorblindness are great for UX
[2:49:16] <heartlesshealer> it's literally just both of the colors look like the same color. Like pink/gray color blindness will have the person think they are the same color. Knew someone who cried when he found out he got a present of his favorite color when it was actually gray
[2:49:19] <%Ipsenscastle> He's saying do an Urkel voice at him
[2:49:21] <OkamiDude15> Minh’s like don’t think, feel

[2:51:55] <RoboticRexkek> segbas2004 converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!
[2:51:55] <stranger59> @vVAstrAVv Just a second or two, but that's what slowing down time is for.
[2:52:16] <emeraldskrull> minh drop a grenade, know what i mean?
[2:52:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Does anyone else remember Jack Packards opinion of this game, which was "it's slow and boring because all I want to do is sit behind cover like this is gears of war"
[2:52:39] <+DesertPenguin> Woolie, you should play Spider-Man (PS4). It's a lot of fun
[2:52:46] <redrins> cover is the new drop your shield
[2:53:02] <%Javaa01> You usually get one set of 3 grenades per one big fight
[2:53:09] <vVAstrAVv> i think he played spidey already
[2:53:24] <%RioGascar> i found out theres melee moves for different weapons
[2:53:50] <+DesertPenguin> I really just wanna see Woolie's version of Dark Souls 3
[2:53:55] <%RioGascar> also that dropkick grenade thing is not as useful as I thought
[2:54:14] <Andrei11Droasca> I'd like to see Woolie do Yakuza 0
[2:54:18] <+NotHereToStream> ^
[2:54:18] <%RioGascar> control also has a morphing weapon
[2:54:28] <buffmurffy> transforminf weapons are the shit
[2:54:33] <%jiggy_snipe> BIG FIST
[2:54:33] <T_Sasquatch> I literally just got vanquish on ps3 lmao
[2:54:34] <jorniev> omni weapon is an awesome idea for a game
[2:54:42] <+Negus_Rex> only hal is dumb
[2:54:44] <jorniev> but it cant be only gun
[2:54:44] <buffmurffy> gotta have that necrid tech
[2:54:53] <rubbishbinge> Malicious was pretty cool
[2:55:05] <jorniev> the hero is dead is also fun
[2:55:09] <TheDandyRex> Woolie see the Jet Set Radio Sona stuff yet?
[2:55:11] <Dapper_Cactuar> John Stewart best Green Lantern
[2:55:35] <+DesertPenguin> Kyle was pretty cool tho
[2:55:40] <Dapper_Cactuar> true
[2:55:42] <+DesertPenguin> In Grant Morrison's JLA it's Kyle so I like him
[2:55:51] <%SomersaultJustice> so you love Green Lantern then Kappa

[2:57:26] <heartlesshealer> War Pigs by Black Sabbath, if anyone's too young or forgetting classic metal
[2:57:31] <RoboticRexkek> but it's not tho
[2:57:39] <%Javaa01> If you're out of AR, expect to die from any sustained amount of fire
[2:57:59] <%RioGascar> You also start sparking
[2:58:14] <RoboticRexkek> it's the sound, slowdown
[2:58:14] <T_Sasquatch> I hate low health ui, it's always shit. I don't need my screen covered in red
[2:58:15] <RoboticRexkek> etc.
[2:58:37] <heartlesshealer> Minh, as you grind you will get used to unconsciously identifying sparking and other stuff
[2:58:42] <%DensityD> a small dose of git gud git fast

[3:00:27] <%RioGascar> better to just adjust
[3:00:27] <heartlesshealer> treat radar as a second tinier screen for more info

[3:05:59] <arkv01> Q U A L I T Y

[3:06:50] <RoboticRexkek> maybe once in a while
[3:06:52] <%Lion_kun> just do a long one now and again
[3:06:56] <Andrei11Droasca> So no SMT games KUL
[3:06:58] <RoboticRexkek> like once a year or something
[3:06:59] <%jiggy_snipe> you need to space out those games
[3:06:59] <%gatorafan> rip the KH LP some people were waiting for.
[3:06:59] <%tearfuldevil> i watch streams only now
[3:07:12] <arkv01> fyi you can do mgs with reggie under 5 hours per numbered game TehePelo
[3:07:15] <%Lion_kun> I'd say once every 6 months
[3:07:16] <%SomersaultJustice> but I love the TMS LP :(
[3:07:22] <%gatorafan> TMS was a great LP, people are cowards.
[3:07:26] <%SomersaultJustice> #13000FE
[3:07:34] <nothuzad> indeed SomersaultJustice :)
[3:07:36] <vVAstrAVv> yeah i watch vods of the long ones if i miss it live
[3:07:41] <arkv01> uncultured swine couldn't enjoy TMS
[3:07:46] <+eggstyr0ne> just edit the long games to short reaction vids
[3:07:47] <%RioGascar> i think the beef games should be like. Wait a couple of full mini lps till a big beefy lp
[3:07:52] <Ranko2Danko> i lovw being a month behind
[3:08:00] <%gatorafan> I'll never forget Matt's inmediate regret for modelling himself after Barry daedra1LaughingTibs
[3:08:03] <Andrei11Droasca> I haven't seen TMS LUL
[3:08:11] <vVAstrAVv> i like falling behind so i can binge later
[3:08:24] <vVAstrAVv> all of wonderful 101
[3:08:39] <RoboticRexkek> yeah I really like the stream so far
[3:08:50] <Andrei11Droasca> I think its that and Comand Mission are the only ones that i haven't seen
[3:08:52] <heartlesshealer> takes from youtube, but adds for viewers in general
[3:08:53] <Zayasu> me :) but I usually leave a like for the videos
[3:08:56] <%tearfuldevil> yeah i way prefer streams over lps
[3:08:57] <%RioGascar> it is odd how far away youtube is now
[3:09:06] <%Irridium> could just do the long ones as straight up streams
[3:09:22] <vVAstrAVv> hey now. twitch vods might get subscribers at least
[3:09:32] <%gatorafan> I still chick Woolie's YT every now and then, mosly when I want to check other people's reaction to some of the gold we find on this streams.
[3:09:38] <%RioGascar> like dooms stream just finished, but the lp hasnt started yet
[3:09:51] <%RioGascar> nor has kotor 2, ds is still going
[3:09:55] <%gatorafan> One day I'll binge Gon in 60 seconds. sometime this decade
[3:10:02] <RoboticRexkek> I don't watch your channel on Youtube sadly, but I really enjoy your streams.
[3:10:11] <heartlesshealer> I don't know if it counts, but I occasionally binge all of the DMC5 videos while I'm doing stuff around the house
[3:10:14] <turbofolk> At least until you are pulling dr. disrespect numbers
