[0:26:09] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:26:13] <%0rond> nah it would be easy with 18 volt, he can spam the disk super fast and switch direcion rapidly
[0:26:20] <+Hollow_Mirage> I like how they have not realized this is a team game not Vs.

[2:42:51] <@Solidus_113> Keep Talking is only 2 players though
[2:43:05] <+Prowtellen> I mean, you can give the manual to more players
[2:43:10] <%ZweihanderSteve> two people can be on the book
[2:43:10] <+Prowtellen> For more CHAOS
[2:43:12] <+fetrigon> @prevot I would want to only do that art style during certain moments of gameplay but yeah me too

[2:51:16] <TopTierHarley> still have to learn how to play
[2:51:24] <+fetrigon> its golf. what's there to learn
[2:51:38] <Hammerknife> all i know about golf is that you hit the ball really hard and try to score a field goal
[2:51:58] <@Solidus_113> you could
[2:52:07] <dds333a> @hammerknife you're describing baseball
[2:52:11] <restingbones> Now you know for next time
[2:52:11] <X2Eliah> So that's just an artificial limit to force ppl to buy more switches
[2:52:15] <X2Eliah> that's shitty

[2:52:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Doesn't one of the current gen consoles let you lend games too?
[2:52:45] <@Solidus_113> download play only works for small games like DS was

[3:20:39] <dds333a> Shank that
[3:21:10] <restingbones> Lets see some special abilities
[3:21:33] <+KaosMachina> you want to spin DOWN for distance, UP for height. I think? Maybe?
[3:21:42] <TheSaltminer> Backspin will make a ball stay in the air longer, so you'll be more affected by the wind whichever way that's going
[3:21:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:22:07] <+KaosMachina> why does Reg have a square pepsi logo around him
[3:22:12] <TheSaltminer> Topspin will make a ball hit the ground faster, so you'll be more affected by the lie and slope
[3:22:16] <+OrangeMDT> Can’t wait for this to get Woolie into golf by next podcast
[3:22:25] <OldManDeckardCain> OH YES

[3:30:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @restingbones spin it, idk why it's called that tho

[3:31:07] <heartlesshealer> anti-personnel powers being used as if they helped the golf part
[3:31:07] <+Jay667b> @restingbones The expression originated in billiards (which dates back to the 16th century: Shakespeare refers to it in Antony and Cleopatra), but in itself dates back to about 1823, when the introduction of a leather cue-tip allowed billiard players to make a side-spin.
