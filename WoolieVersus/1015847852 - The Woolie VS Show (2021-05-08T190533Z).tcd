[1:39:42] <NaughtySenpai69> I was probably smoking weed and play SF4
[1:40:01] <Mirakei> What if the Post Mortem Hitstun Decay is slower than the bodies degration decay?
[1:40:13] <Mirakei> watch the head rot in real time as you combo it
[1:40:13] <GeltonZ> ...and Woolie knows a thing or two about pies!
[1:40:39] <%ggbhtg> If we get Weaponlord 2, Woolie will do a GG Lore style video for it Kappa

[1:43:34] <Applecannon63> So Kof15 has some Neowave shit tech
[1:43:35] <+b_aleph> Neowave has the best selection screen of any SNK game
[1:43:38] <dds333a> Atomiswave is neat, but I haven't played many of those either
[1:43:43] <Super_Voltekka> Mikado did a tournament of Kenju once
[1:43:56] <Applecannon63> C+Dmoves
[1:44:06] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus do you have the spreadsheet with the movelists?
[1:44:07] <GeltonZ> KenJu was never released and was only dumped a few months ago so it is a heavy mystery. DOES have a Discord though.

[1:48:18] <GeltonZ> KenJu is more penetrable than Weapon Lord XD
[1:48:38] <Applecannon63> Dramatic Finishers!?
[1:48:41] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus dramatic strikes are SF3 styled super ars
[1:48:42] <moogleboy1984> Magic Series safe on block?
[1:48:43] <Mibeador> arts*
[1:48:46] <dds333a> @geltonz I believe it CarlSmile CarlSmile CarlSmile
[1:48:53] <puluxor> Not surprised, that much style is guaranteed to garner a following
[1:49:14] <Applecannon63> so is this what also inspired Capcom fighters all stars?
[1:49:24] <Applecannon63> with the dramatic gimmicks
[1:49:37] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus air drive is GG dust, it hits overhead
[1:49:51] <pixelkenj> Did someone call my name
[1:50:17] <%ggbhtg> Oh hey, this game is listed on Fightcade. Didn't know they did Atmos, heard it was a weird format.
[1:50:18] <dds333a> Ah, I am familiar with these Jebaited
[1:50:18] <leith_aziz> I never played any of the JoJo games. Im still hoping for an Arcsys JoJo fighter in the future
[1:50:18] <Mibeador> also that wiki doesn't have the full movelist, the spreadsheet is prolly better
[1:50:21] <jetjagger222> fortunately no primal rage/weapon lord style hold+motion inputs
[1:50:42] <%ggbhtg> This game and Weaponlord are both listed on Fightcade
[1:50:50] <%Juriasu> was that guys name "Slayman"
[1:50:55] <dds333a> @leith_aziz Jojoban and ASB are both great
[1:50:55] <%ggbhtg> Fightcade been movin a bit
[1:50:55] <Applecannon63> wow that protag has only one command normal
[1:50:56] <GeltonZ> @leith_aziz They've outright said they won't make one because the Capcom fighter is too good.
[1:50:57] <leith_aziz> AOF Boss
[1:51:00] <jetjagger222> not-blacker baron
[1:51:11] <DaKnightWarrior> The art has always been so sick.

[1:51:38] <Applecannon63> HENSHIN
[1:51:42] <%ggbhtg> Fightcade may be movin, but it doesn't mean every game is suddenly Rollback

[1:52:40] <%Juriasu> okay this actually looks sick
[1:52:41] <@Solidus_113> main found
[1:52:46] <DaKnightWarrior> The character models feel very TvC.
[1:52:52] <floralkami> wait, is this not 3d movement?
[1:53:00] <Deko_> oh i thought it was a 3d fighter this looks sick
[1:53:02] <jetjagger222> nope its like rival schools
[1:53:08] <%gatorafan> P R E S S U R E D A N G E R
[1:53:09] <jetjagger222> on no
[1:53:10] <+b_aleph> what's that meter on top?
[1:53:17] <jetjagger222> rival schools had a dodge
[1:53:19] <floralkami> I also thought Rival Schools was a 3d movement fighter
[1:53:20] <dds333a> A little tug of war system
[1:53:20] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> We got systems
[1:53:21] <pacibuddy> unist moment
[1:53:24] <leith_aziz> @GeltonZ:  Ehh. I still dont buy that. I also remember that being a pretty old statement, so who knows? Reminder that they made DBFZ in a world where the Budokai games exist, and they're apparently very beloved.
[1:53:31] <%ggbhtg> is that a TOP Gauge
[1:53:32] <dds333a> COME OVER  HERE
[1:53:36] <Potatoidea> COME OVER HERE
[1:53:39] <BliVru> MANO STRIKRU! wait that means hand hit?
[1:53:43] <%Juriasu> he's just a rider LUL
[1:53:47] <+samuraiknack> What game are we playing now? I went to get a drink
[1:53:53] <dds333a> Kenju
[1:53:56] <Applecannon63> HENSHIN
[1:53:58] <GeltonZ> @leith_aziz There's a HUGE difference between the okay quality of Budokai and the Capcom Jojo fighters but indeed we shall see.
[1:54:07] <%ggbhtg> FINAL ATTACK RIDE
[1:54:13] <floralkami> damn, you mean to tell me there was cel-shaded 3D models like this already, yet NO ONE in AAA is using this technique??
[1:54:14] <+ManOfReason> looks pretty rad
[1:54:15] <jetjagger222> @samuraiknack kenju
[1:54:15] <leith_aziz> The cell shading is really good, I gotta say
[1:54:24] <Applecannon63> Dude literally has a Typhoon Belt

[1:54:36] <+TheyTookMyBeard> Slayman atpCap
[1:54:38] <jetjagger222> nanoha has one wide-ass face
[1:54:40] <Mibeador> The pressure meter is the big meter below the health bars. It increases when you do actions that benefit yourselve, like hitting the opponent and landing parries. When it's full, hitting a special will trigger Kenju Kakusei which is pretty much a free full 50% combo
[1:54:41] <+allups> lol his name is slayman, so fiting
[1:54:46] <GeltonZ> Dihol Brandhorse!

[1:56:04] <moogleboy1984> Morrigan dashes?
[1:56:09] <usurper_sos> Yoo air control
[1:56:18] <Potatoidea> Whoa
[1:56:19] <+waltzqueen> HAJIMARU ARIGATO
[1:56:19] <jetjagger222> nanoha has some elena shit
[1:56:21] <@Solidus_113> dust
[1:56:25] <dds333a> Right, that's the dust
[1:56:27] <DaKnightWarrior> @floralkami it really does.
[1:56:40] <dds333a> Just, in reverse
[1:56:42] <+samuraiknack> Did Ninja Theory get Slayman and Dante mixed up
[1:56:46] <Applecannon63> Holy shit was that a Dust Attack
[1:56:47] <Iwashi94> Animal Island!
[1:56:51] <%Zero_Jacks> zyzxOHSNAP I remember seeing this
[1:56:55] <Iwashi94> Miracle Adventure!
[1:56:55] <leith_aziz> I kinda wish unique fight intros were still a thing. There were the DBFZ intros, but they kinda gave up on that after launch. Well, the unique dialog is still great
[1:57:05] <Potatoidea> LUL
[1:57:05] <%Juriasu> LUL
[1:57:08] <dds333a> Do the combo
[1:57:16] <BlackermanZX> thjs game looks cool
[1:57:16] <Potatoidea> His back is broken now
[1:57:20] <pi_in_the_sci> The Bald Eagle crest on the stage floor is dope
[1:57:21] <%jepupu> Pressure went to max yeah
[1:57:23] <Super_Voltekka> To think this game was both fully made and fully translated and it somehow got the axe?!?
[1:57:29] <BlackermanZX> is that friggin hol horse StinkyGlitch
[1:57:39] <floralkami> I really hope this is on Fightcade
[1:57:48] <Applecannon63> So Kenju Awakening just Darkforce?
[1:57:50] <DaKnightWarrior> I miss fighters being this wacky.
[1:57:57] <pi_in_the_sci> I also like that it plays coconut trotting when Slayerman moves
[1:58:09] <GeltonZ> @floralkami Apparently it IS but it might be wonky. It's a Dreamcast game mostly.
[1:58:17] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus The pressure meter is the big meter below the health bars. It increases when you do actions that benefit yourselve, like hitting the opponent and landing parries. When it's full, hitting a special will trigger Kenju Kakusei which is pretty much a free full 50% combo
[1:58:17] <dds333a> He's not really like any Jojo character, he's very much in the vein of Needless
[1:58:19] <Potatoidea> Get this brat some pants
[1:58:20] <moogleboy1984> Like putting SF2 Guile into MVC2
[1:58:23] <+waltzqueen> she has no undewear on
[1:58:31] <+dr_steve1790> I would totally main Nanoha. She's a ninja after my heart. <3
[1:58:33] <Potatoidea> Uh
[1:58:48] <Applecannon63> The Rake?
[1:58:51] <HuggbeesTV> This game looks fucking sick
[1:58:51] <SNK_Dan> What in the world are these characters LUL
[1:58:53] <dds333a> De Rake, like Drake, I assume
[1:58:54] <jetjagger222> its anime freeman
[1:58:55] <floralkami> @waltzqueen did you not see the red?
[1:58:57] <Potatoidea> Nice Dio pose
[1:59:02] <dds333a> Like saying Duraku
[1:59:02] <GeltonZ> The lolis tag out, one is charge the other is command.
[1:59:04] <+waltzqueen> @floralkami i guess i didn't
[1:59:05] <Iwashi94> De Rake? Balakey?
[1:59:06] <floralkami> it was a bodysuit
[1:59:14] <%ggbhtg> negative penalty huh
[1:59:15] <jetjagger222> wow dio
[1:59:23] <Potatoidea> Even has the birthmark
[1:59:25] <leith_aziz> @Super_Voltekka Its not the only game to get such treament, unfortunately. There was that pretty funny Wii game that only released on EU. Nintendo never released it outside becuase of sales
[1:59:25] <%Juriasu> he's just dio
[1:59:28] <puluxor> SO anime! asakuraWow
[1:59:31] <usurper_sos> That stance

[1:59:47] <floralkami> Dio looking ass wannebe
[1:59:48] <+waltzqueen> Micheal Jackson scream
[1:59:49] <+samuraiknack> Stand users of the week:The Fighting game
[1:59:52] <dds333a> This is more of a Jojo character than Slayman
[2:00:01] <Mibeador> sometimes full screen parries just randomly happen lol
[2:00:02] <Potatoidea> Soup soup
[2:00:03] <frankenpimm> Just got done watching the Mortal Kombat movie... countc4Boy was that a rollercoaster
[2:00:04] <@Menitta> Oh man this looks sick
[2:00:06] <leith_aziz> Closest thing I can think of from Rake is a mix of Dio/Diavolo
[2:00:07] <%Juriasu> zoop zoop zoop
[2:00:08] <jetjagger222> meanwhile jongha looks like a mook from cowboy bebop
[2:00:12] <dds333a> Since he SEEMS to be a reference, but I'll wait until it's obvious
[2:00:17] <Potatoidea> Diovolo
[2:00:19] <+waltzqueen> @frankenpimm which one?
[2:00:30] <Iwashi94> I'm really digging this art style
[2:00:30] <%ggbhtg> @dds333a Slayman couldn't be in Steel Ball Run?
[2:00:41] <frankenpimm> @waltzqueen The new one. I have very mixed emotions

[2:01:09] <jetjagger222> well at least we know claudio from tekken wasn't the first character to fight entirely with jojo poses
[2:01:10] <%ZweihanderSteve> damn this vame looks great
[2:01:32] <+YPFrost> what game is this?
[2:01:33] <dds333a> i.e. he's not Jojo enough, nor is he a reference, to my knowledge
[2:01:34] <moogleboy1984> If this were a kickstarter today, it would hit goal in a single day, bet
[2:01:38] <+b_aleph> MONKE

[2:03:25] <Super_Voltekka> MonkiFlip
[2:03:26] <BlackermanZX> art style reminds me a lot of megaman legends
[2:03:27] <dds333a> Hanuman only looks like him, I guess, and only to an extent
[2:03:48] <floralkami> yeah, I said this was like the best evolution from MML
[2:03:52] <jetjagger222> hanuman looks like he's got some nutso pressure
[2:04:02] <T_Sasquatch> also fight stage at a football staduium is sooo bizzare LUL

[2:06:12] <+kennneh> I love the art style. A few  visual upgrades and this could be released today.
[2:06:14] <+samuraiknack> I'm gonna tell my kids this is Terry vs Geese
[2:06:15] <Applecannon63> So like a mild Ken with Rock moves
[2:06:51] <Mibeador> Tairon's throw is a hit throw
[2:06:57] <Mibeador> it's his best combo ender tho

[2:12:17] <%gatorafan> Which Gacha did this lady come from? daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:12:20] <crimsonsaens> So she's Cammy?
[2:12:23] <%jepupu> This game has some heavy hit sounds.
[2:12:25] <DSD24> Tornado Stike!
[2:12:38] <dds333a> Ooh, hints of music I like
[2:12:43] <moogleboy1984> Apparently there's two characters that can be unlocked, but no one knows how to yet
[2:12:45] <DSD24> Woolie always finds the Boxer
[2:12:46] <dds333a> I'm hearing it
[2:12:53] <JetpackMcQuack> throw her onto the roof
[2:13:03] <PMda2nd> she's still flying
[2:13:07] <dds333a> @dsd24 reggie found him CarlSmile first

[2:13:19] <puluxor> I like her style, no joke
[2:13:20] <DSD24> @dds333a Oh my mistake then

[2:13:38] <+skylerpilot> that boxer is HUGE
[2:13:45] <Mirakei> Does the pressure meter do anything or is it just a visual indicator?
[2:13:57] <%jepupu> Getting counter hit seems to drop the bar?
[2:14:03] <GeltonZ> @Mirakei It does SOMETHING crazy but I forget what.
[2:14:04] <Mirakei> because if it enabled or disabled moves/supers etc depending on where it is that'd be really interesting
[2:14:06] <Iwashi94> LUL
[2:14:09] <$pixelkenj> such range
[2:14:16] <halfmasks> @Mirakei I think meter is affected by pressure
[2:14:17] <dds333a> According to what people more knowledgeable than I have said, it actually does something
[2:14:18] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus wanna play online? Flycast dojo has netplay and I could show you some stuff since I've played the game a lot
[2:14:23] <@Solidus_113> WHY DIDN'T THIS COME OUT
[2:14:24] <WakeUpThrow> Boy, a big body with Steve-esque sways is fucking terrifying
[2:14:29] <%jepupu> I thing getting hit with a counter hit lowers the meter

[2:15:26] <puluxor> this music oneeMonkas
[2:15:28] <Mirakei> the pressure meter goes up as you hit the opponent, block or not. So it clearly wants you to be aggressive. But what it actually gives you when you make it go up
[2:15:29] <+Gamblitz> The Circus is in town it looks like

[2:15:43] <puluxor> This has got to be the twin's stage
[2:15:45] <dds333a> @mibeador got any lore you could drop on us? or maybe @geltonz or @pixelkenj
[2:15:49] <DSD24> Roger looks like Ky
[2:15:49] <%gatorafan> catJAM
[2:15:56] <Mibeador> uh, there isn't muhc lore
[2:15:56] <%jepupu> Clown cagefights
[2:16:00] <Mibeador> cause most of the story is missing lol
[2:16:00] <JetpackMcQuack> what a bet
[2:16:02] <WakeUpThrow> Wow these don't look like early 2000's models at all, they're fantastic
[2:16:04] <dds333a> If possible, anyway, I could do without

[2:16:16] <%gatorafan> @Mibeador THE DARK SOULS OF FIGHTING GAMES Kappa
[2:16:26] <%jepupu> Counterhit probably
[2:16:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:16:30] <Applecannon63> Roger is Ky and Rock with moves from Ken
[2:16:38] <$pixelkenj> Is Roger wearing a speedo over his pants
[2:16:47] <Mibeador> but basically, there's an evil scientist organization that's trying to make a perfect world, that organization includes Tairon and the final boss character the twins De-rake and Gale. The good guys are trying to stop them for their personal reasons
[2:16:52] <Mirakei> imagine if you only had reversals if the pressure meter was in the "danger range" as in the person currently having the momentum disadvantage gets access to reversals
[2:16:53] <moogleboy1984> Juggle Dimension seems really jarring
[2:17:16] <Mibeador> also Tairon isn't Roger's dad
[2:17:17] <dds333a> @mibeador not surspirising that De Rake is an antagonist, neat
[2:17:22] <Mirakei> There's some interesting potential concepts there regardless of how this game itself actually works.
[2:17:27] <Applecannon63> Thats what Guilty Gear's Dust Attacks were like
[2:17:32] <Mibeador> De-rake betrays the main antagonist for some reason so yeah
[2:17:39] <jetjagger222> wow is that mexican ultimate warrior

[2:40:06] <%drefizz> Was that LEO?
[2:40:08] <+PkSilent01> did they play the twins?
[2:40:13] <Mibeador> they played them once
[2:40:20] <Applecannon63> Yes Hotblooded Rider
[2:40:20] <dds333a> I didn't know what to expect from just the screenshots

[2:41:37] <Applecannon63> Batsu as a Hot blooded Kamen Rider 2
[2:41:38] <floralkami> @drefizz there are ass and thigh lovers, and then there's me.
[2:41:47] <%drefizz> I love both
[2:41:59] <Mibeador> the spinny move you saw woolie do is great for air juggles but it's -43 cause the second half of it whiffs on ground
[2:41:59] <%drefizz> and personality :)
[2:42:04] <dds333a> Kakusei time
[2:42:13] <floralkami> you and I can get along @drefizz
[2:42:13] <%ggbhtg> actual Rider Kick
[2:42:13] <Applecannon63> RIDER KICK
[2:42:18] <DaKnightWarrior> Kenju is wild.
[2:42:38] <jetjagger222> @Mibeador it looks like death on hit or whiff
[2:42:46] <Mibeador> it's a free punish yeaj
[2:42:50] <floralkami> damn, I can't believe all these guys have different fits
[2:42:55] <dds333a> Damn
[2:42:57] <Applecannon63> I mean Batsu's Ryusei Kick is a Rider Kick
[2:43:04] <floralkami> so much love in this game...
[2:43:10] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus wanna play online? Flycast dojo has netplay and I could show you some stuff since I've played the game a lot
[2:43:12] <DSD24> De Rake is cool
[2:43:29] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus any special move activates KK when pressure is fool
[2:43:32] <Mibeador> dang
[2:43:39] <Mibeador> full*
[2:43:43] <+Xeno351> the game is just straight up done, so why did it never get released?
[2:43:44] <jetjagger222> hey sleyman also has a little monkey buddy
[2:43:47] <jetjagger222> on his shoulder
[2:44:00] <+IronChefWookie> is that an aipom?
[2:44:08] <floralkami> who owns this IP? Capcom?
[2:44:09] <Mibeador> @Xeno351 there's actually an unfinished character left in the code who you can play as by hacking
[2:44:25] <%drefizz> LOL
[2:44:30] <Applecannon63> @xeno351 not really finished cause one character has 2 moves
[2:44:37] <dds333a> Meter seems to come and go, but I don't know if people who actually know can chime in
[2:44:55] <Pookiedaexzile> ATTA

[2:45:20] <Applecannon63> DAT DROP KICK
[2:45:24] <dds333a> God Backbreaker  to Dropkick
[2:45:25] <Mibeador> @dds333a supers are really good cause they're just a free 50% or give some characters a command throw, and for most characters they don't spend EX much since they can do damage without. Guard cancels need meter tho so that's useful
[2:45:30] <floralkami> anyone knows who owns this IP?
[2:45:46] <dds333a> @mibeador thanks for the info
[2:45:48] <Mibeador> it's owned by Sammy Corporation I think
[2:45:56] <%drefizz> OOOO
[2:46:05] <dds333a> OOOOH
[2:46:09] <brunoberserk> chief thunder hawk condor
[2:46:10] <derap41> Death by spinning
[2:46:28] <dds333a> @brunoberserk *Eagle Screech*
[2:46:34] <floralkami> @mibeador I'm guessing they either still open it or was brought out and the IP was left to dust?
[2:46:40] <floralkami> *own
[2:46:51] <Mibeador> they probably just still own it and it's gathering dust
[2:47:00] <floralkami> cause this needs some love, man
[2:47:07] <derap41> Don't look at chat like that Woolie
[2:47:12] <%Sparkseid> oof

[2:47:19] <Mibeador> could start a kickstarter and see who takes it down lol
[2:47:22] <+pupil31> TORNADO
[2:47:24] <%drefizz> woolieMINHMAX @derap41
[2:47:27] <floralkami> at least in the form of taking the characters for another game.
[2:47:47] <feralspidey> to be fair, misspelled grammar was the rule of cool back in the late 90s early 00s
[2:47:47] <Applecannon63> jeez the guitar
[2:47:52] <%drefizz> TORNADE
[2:47:54] <+pupil31> I like ya cut G
[2:47:57] <$SilverRoddo> He‚Äôs doing what best for biznuhz
[2:47:57] <Pookiedaexzile> What you don't know is he's only the size  of Mayweather but since the games in Japan, He's huge
[2:48:11] <+pupil31> She gave him that "I like ya cut g" slaps
[2:48:16] <derap41> Are those boots or like comfy socks
[2:48:17] <floralkami> tbf, Tornade sounds like a cool move name as-is
[2:48:20] <dds333a> GODDAMN

[2:50:03] <Mibeador> it's really hard to do some inputs
[2:50:32] <Applecannon63> is it that strict?
[2:50:38] <dds333a> There are fighting games characters who already say TORNADE, I just can't think if any right now
[2:50:38] <brunoberserk> return to MONKE
[2:50:48] <puluxor> I don't like him, but all-in on monke
[2:50:57] <Mibeador> doing full magic combos builds a shit ton of meter, especially since HKs build 1/3 of a bar
[2:50:59] <Applecannon63> Sean's HYPER TORNADE
[2:51:00] <derap41> sad monke
