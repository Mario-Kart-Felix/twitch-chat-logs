[0:01:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> A whole YEAR to read them all. 10K PAGES
[0:01:58] <%doomerskeletor13> I‚Äôd say most of them are pretty good
[0:02:01] <%Asuterisuku> The same way there are way more Witcher books than have been published because two of them are short story compilations.
[0:02:02] <drewslo> I read 4
[0:02:04] <%jorniev> SOME OF THEM EVEN GOOD
[0:02:05] <correctedsun117> Contact Harvest is GREAT
[0:02:05] <%hattrick61> Infinate book works
[0:02:06] <%RioGascar> How many books for star wars exist
[0:02:06] <%VCRUZZO> how many are good is the question
[0:02:08] <shitter_pounder_69> im rereading them all right now, albeit very slowly
[0:02:08] <%raven_frame> cheer500 If you like dumb anime, you should check out the Hayabusa armour in the Halo 3 customizer sometime.
[0:02:11] <%subjectg> emphasis on ‚Äúmost‚Äù are pretty good
[0:02:12] <garbageheaphound> Honestly they are pretty good

[0:02:51] <HereComestheChief> ItsHappening NotLikeThis
[0:02:53] <+caskit_case> breaking out the redwall lore
[0:02:54] <drewslo> those star wars books have some REAL stupid shit in them
[0:02:58] <centuronstar> Just to say if you're not into novels. There are some graphic novels for the Fall of Reach that were done by Marvel. They were fairly good.
[0:02:59] <andrex2311> THE BEST CRYSIS!
[0:03:02] <+LandOfTheWay> I'm surprised woolie was so ready to go for this stream after Judgement Nutting to that SFV announcement
[0:03:03] <+QueequegTheater> THE SUIT DOESN'T JACK HIM OFF
[0:03:04] <DigitalJoshie> I've read fall of reach, and bits of First Strike and thats it
[0:03:08] <%BisoromiBear> what a legend
[0:03:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> @centuronstar Wow
[0:03:10] <%derap41> I READ THE FUCKING BOOKS!
[0:03:11] <DatAsuna> I enjoy the kilo5 stuff
[0:03:11] <%yhom_tork> LuL
[0:03:15] <DatAsuna> well 2/3 of it
[0:03:17] <khalcatto> horus heresy is only part of 40k lore.. and its 56 BOOKS!!!
[0:03:18] <%krispen_wa> Okay, but is there as much text as Proust?
[0:03:18] <%doomerskeletor13> The best part is that he had never even played Halo before
[0:03:20] <andrex2311> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:03:20] <DigitalJoshie> if you want halo lore, just watch lore videos
[0:03:21] <correctedsun117> @WoolieVersus It was all to get ready for Halo: Infinite, and then 343 said that only Halo Wars 2 counts, lol
[0:03:23] <kaidogs> the suit doesnt jack him off... waynerSob
[0:03:24] <%Holycow8498> cheer500 have you watched Halo Legends V and is it something you'd recommend to Woolie
[0:03:27] <%Dean_Inbetween> A vacuum and funfact he never played any of the games at the start @woolieversus
[0:03:29] <sniffy77> Forerunner Trilogy is awesome but its VERY hard scifi
[0:03:32] <OverlordLuna> PogChamp
[0:03:32] <%brachydios777> Yep LUL
[0:03:32] <%huskarl_zap> Ride or die gamers SeemsGood
[0:03:33] <@Menitta> Don't fuck with Halo fans. We WILL keep explaining the lore to you
[0:03:35] <+zachbat13> he didnt play any of the games either
[0:03:40] <%krispen_wa> THE COLE PICKLE STONE
[0:03:43] <%huskarl_zap> fake fans get out
[0:03:45] <%Halospaz117> He didn't like Cole Protocol I think
[0:03:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> IT IS THE THING
[0:03:46] <%yhom_tork> halo is hype as hell
[0:03:48] <DatAsuna> More halo stuff needs overt title drops
[0:03:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Menitta please, no, have mercy, I have children!
[0:03:53] <%doomerskeletor13> THEY SAID THE THING
[0:03:54] <sniffy77> he... he doesnt have his suit jack him off
[0:03:59] <%MajoraZ> It's ironic because the Cole Protocol one of the more meh novels, IMO at least
[0:03:59] <prime_name> SF5 news happened I guess.
[0:04:00] <%Holycow8498> I am doing alright i don't know how the rest of chat is doing

[0:04:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Menitta I will see your Halo Fandom and raise you the Warhammer Fandom
[0:04:04] <%QuadraticGravity> @sniffy77 No, it was a photoshop
[0:04:04] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @menitta don't mess with halo fans, they will keep telling you that the suit doesn't jack him off
[0:04:05] <%derap41> We're getting the Halos I'm happy
[0:04:06] <+mikesapartment> finish the fight tho
[0:04:11] <%RyTYoung> It's grav hammer time BOIIIS
[0:04:12] <%Tearonex> Halo's cool, but Akira got announced so that a lot cooler right now
[0:04:12] <%subjectg> funnily enough the actual story of the cole protocol is not in that book
[0:04:12] <%The_Swedish_X> We made it a dumb joke. Because it is a dumb bit.
[0:04:13] <shitter_pounder_69> i dig halo lore, ive dug it for a really long time. just something about that appeals to me hard

[0:06:39] <letshavecakes> The halo 3 terminals are so esoteric for an uninitiated player that reading them in the first place is more just a formality of the playthrough than an actual goal
[0:06:41] <sniffy77> this cole protocol is very fresh
[0:06:42] <marvel877> 4 and 5 are the ones that act like you read the books anyways...
[0:06:46] <+ntfth> They became book stuff.
[0:06:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> That glance offscreen felt like he actually had a secret book over there
[0:06:50] <%BisoromiBear> reading atpCap
[0:06:53] <%jorniev> there is ONLY one book woolie reads
[0:06:59] <%jorniev> and needs

[0:10:25] <%Asuterisuku> Given that he's been doing a Legacy, do you think that someone at Capcom might have leaked Dan to Max?
[0:10:26] <+QueequegTheater> JUST LET HIM HAVE ONE WIN
[0:10:29] <Solidnick18> Maybe he learned something
[0:10:30] <%johnny_gogo> @WoolieVersus Normal pro?

[0:10:33] <%subjectg> 5th character is morrigan, new darkstalkers announced after reveal, that‚Äôs my two cents
[0:10:33] <%huskarl_zap> make dan the best character in the game
[0:10:34] <slatersev> the Halo 3 Terminals arent book stuff. They orginate in 3
[0:10:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cooler Dan

Hopefully, the humans will try to institute galactic civil rights someday, but they Unngoy are the whole reason the Human-Covie war started to begin with, so they aren't totally innocent.

A certain Forerunner made it their purpose to "catalogue" and "reseed" as many planets with life on them as they could before the Arrays fired. Makes more sense, right?

[1:02:51] <%Holycow8498> The arbiter has whiskers?
[1:02:53] <%nxflre> Game Audio is a bit low!
[1:03:04] <%GooseGuy99> It is very hard to hit a hunter's neck, you basically need to hit the worms in the back
[1:03:08] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> get them in the neck or the back... or the pussy or the crack
[1:03:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> ^
[1:03:16] <DomunDomunDomun> Game audio seems perfect to me.

[1:05:02] <Mr_Strut> The godzilla roar is another good example

[1:05:03] <%yhom_tork> PogChamp
[1:05:08] <%Holycow8498> The Godzilla roar is famously is a rubber glove against a stringed instrument iirc

[1:05:37] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @squidmax1 watch it be like flood ambient noise or something
[1:05:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> have they just started, was there a cutscene?
[1:05:37] <+YabbaTroll> his head scattered
[1:05:38] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @CappuccinoGuil no
[1:05:38] <Joestar1890> @Holycow8498 The string was also covered in oil, I believe
[1:05:39] <heartlesshealer> PartyHat yaaaaaay
[1:05:39] <%subjectg> @squidmax1 pugs are cute but damn do they sound like they‚Äôre struggling at all times

[1:05:46] <+QueequegTheater> @CappuccinoGuil Woolie has run out of ammo three times already
[1:05:47] <%Dean_Inbetween> I thought the pug were cute little grunt snarls but apparently its a secret...
[1:05:47] <sniffy77> i dont feel so good mr woolie
[1:05:48] <DomunDomunDomun> They recorded an original xbox with a EM sensing microphone thing for one, too.

[1:06:05] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @cappuccinoguil there was a cutscene but it was already shown at the end of the last session
[1:06:06] <black0193> Did Woolie forget that the Brute Shot has a better melee?
[1:06:06] <letshavecakes> Meleeing with a sniper when he has a brute shot
[1:06:12] <%doomerskeletor13> I wish one of these games would give us a Grunt buddy, I would protect him with my life
[1:06:13] <%huskarl_zap> INB4 WOOLIE MISSES IT
[1:06:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> BUT ITS AN EVEN FIGHT
[1:06:18] <Maids4lyfe> woolie still doesn't use the melee on the brute shot
[1:06:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> misses what
[1:06:19] <SomeAsianDood> brute shot was out of ammo though
[1:06:22] <%yhom_tork> F
[1:06:24] <AppleBerryKitty> bruts are so easy to take down in 3 they nerfed them hard, melee just works.
[1:06:24] <$LightningLynx89> The craziest sound magic is always the fact that Godzilla‚Äôs roar is a rubber glove being ran across a large string instrument (maybe bass)

[1:07:11] <+kd2jag> @LightningLynx89 a "resin-covered" glove, running across the string of a contrabass.
[1:07:12] <%Bonerlord911> isnt only the last terminal different on legendary?
[1:07:13] <%jorniev> LP TAX
[1:07:17] <%huskarl_zap> why is the stream lagging?

[1:08:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> medicaid bias
[1:08:19] <DomunDomunDomun> It's not like they had another game series with terminals in them before this one.
[1:08:20] <Joestar1890> But could you even understand Forerunner?
[1:08:21] <%Superspider51> Bioshock was later iirc

[1:08:57] <%DappercatEsquire> paucity mean small quantities

[1:09:36] <%huskarl_zap> Zaber? PogChamp
[1:09:38] <karl_rex> Maginot is french
[1:09:38] <+facenorway> The one time they should use french pronounciation
[1:09:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Maginot, which is a historical reference you should know
[1:09:43] <%jorniev> ADAM JENSEN IS cyborg jesus
[1:09:43] <%einherjarvalk> wait how do you read the next page? I tried every button when I got them
[1:09:51] <+MidnightBurst12> I am extremely offended
[1:09:52] <Ahk_90> I think V just missed the I in Maginot
[1:09:53] <+IntrepidEye> Should note that the words in brackets are the closest english equivalent for the translation
[1:09:56] <ZeroCruz> Big reads
[1:09:57] <%huskarl_zap> give em the D
[1:09:59] <%subjectg> @datasuna the implication is that these words are substituted for their closest equivalent
[1:10:01] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Woolie: *screams internally in Quebecois*
[1:10:02] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus Have V look up what the Maginot line was

[1:10:49] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> ARBITER FUCKED
[1:10:51] <+mechslayer71> These are kinda lame compared to the previous ones
[1:10:53] <+agumon9000> Chat shhhh
[1:10:56] <DatAsuna> @subjectg except the closest equiv would be "defensive line" not the name of some french minister
[1:10:57] <%seniormeatbox> it makes sense
[1:10:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @bruthabone yes
[1:10:59] <umbrellaswereawesome> Yeah, I laughed my ass at all the game-only fans who thought that 343 made D and L up.
[1:10:59] <Spiderfacev> shut up chat!!!
[1:10:59] <Daskolin> MODS START THE BAN WAFFER
[1:11:01] <FiendishlyInventive> "You thought time was your ally, but now it has abandoned you."
[1:11:03] <Darth_Mama> Chat always gotta show they recognize stuff
[1:11:05] <+dovahkingprime> how long have they been playing?
[1:11:05] <centuronstar> @90k9 They planned thousands of stuff. But they all failed. And the rest they didn't have time for straight up
[1:11:07] <+thfiddles> the previous terminals were added way later
[1:11:10] <pizza_oven3000> halo 4 makes more sens now
[1:11:12] <AThing_> @mechslayer71 These were in OG 3, the one's in 1 and 2 were added with the remaster.
[1:11:17] <%huskarl_zap> d gives the D
[1:11:17] <%doomerskeletor13> The Star Wars galaxy is fucking huge
[1:11:20] <%seniormeatbox> these are bungies terminal, not 343
[1:11:21] <+portlandsunshine> Humanity held 800 worlds before the Covenant attacked
[1:11:21] <+agumon9000> Chat its currently 2007.
[1:11:23] <AThing_> So I think the budget for them is a lot lower
[1:11:28] <%dekkitout> Enough to make the Fermi Paradox blush
[1:11:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:11:29] <DPmusique> True terminals
[1:11:34] <+mechslayer71> @athing_ I know. My statement stands
[1:11:35] <%Zceryll> less than there were before the covenant!
[1:11:36] <+D00msDayDan> why the fuck are people talking about halo 4 in here
[1:11:36] <sniffy77> in halo there are a lot of planets with life, but sentient species are extremely rare
[1:11:39] <ZeroCruz> 2007 FOOLS
[1:11:40] <90k9> @centuronstar I was talkin about Bungie
[1:11:42] <%Holycow8498> Yep these are Bungie terminals
[1:11:43] <DatAsuna> @lewdskeletor13 Acttually it's the same size as the milky way, it's just super dense with twice as many stars
[1:11:45] <%subjectg> @datasuna hey, them translators thought it poetic, and it‚Äôs a convenient one-word way of implicating the scale of the line
[1:11:46] <umbrellaswereawesome> Also, the style is a reference to how terminals were in Marathon.
[1:11:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> Can someone PM me what is going on in the time-based bits?
[1:11:54] <%seniormeatbox> it all makes sense now
[1:11:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> chat y'all are like the person asking questions about the film while we're both watching the film for the first time

[1:39:00] <+Dragoneye77> Halo 5's Multiplayer was good
[1:39:03] <voodoolawyer> One thing I really like about Bungie's writing team is their focus on the language of lore and things written. For example, in Destiny 2, there are phrases the Wish Dragon Riven will say in the lore pieces on armor that don't translate over perfectly. So they have the [words] in brackets. The meaning is the same, sort of. Super cool the way they do that.

[2:14:55] <%The_Swedish_X> just johnson
[2:14:55] <%DSD24> @mujahideenfruityrebels There is one for Halo 1 on Woolie's Channel
[2:14:58] <StarlitStunner> @dsd24 truuuuuue
[2:14:59] <voodoolawyer> at least kid me was too stupid for that
[2:15:01] <Nomad94> Johnson is an entire platoon
[2:15:02] <$mnzion> Is this the longest single level in the trilogy?
[2:15:05] <%Gruhunchously> Kill is fucking confirmed
[2:15:08] <%The_Swedish_X> no sharing that rock
[2:15:10] <Jaku2011> You get them Nolan!

[2:15:17] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus I can't believe Martin Walker's descendants made it this far
[2:15:17] <heartlesshealer> @mujahideenfruityrebels Some of it was posted in the compilation on the youtube channel and I think GSP's channel?
[2:15:17] <Sp3ctre48> Nah there are levels in Halo 2 way longer than this one
[2:15:19] <Nomad94> @mnzion I'd say the Reach finale is about as long...on legendary

[2:23:04] <black0193> I was about to say Woolie should use the AR up close to not waste BR ammo.

[2:25:56] <voodoolawyer> Fun Fact about the Covenant Carbine: The Covenant used mostly plasma based weaponry (rifle, pistol, fuel rod, etc) because of it's destructive power. After engaging with humanity for the first couple times, the pistol (so the Halo 1 pistol) was so destructive that they replicated a bigger version of it in their own alien way.

[2:51:06] <%Javaa01> Ah yes, the most advanced of alien armaments: The Molotov Cocktail
[2:51:07] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @macabreopus they're a lot easier to see as a viewer than as a player

[2:52:49] <letshavecakes> To be fair to bungie, the terminals were way more inscrutable when I was 15 and had no frame of reference for any of that stuff

[2:53:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @letshavecakes i read the books but it was still mysterious because there was no lore a"About" the forerunners yet
[2:53:28] <viridianowl> He absorbed the minds of the galaxy's greatest roasters.
[2:53:30] <dripsydoo> gravemind: gg ez
[2:53:31] <%RioGascar> John wouldnt react to this shit at all
[2:53:32] <%Superspider51> if only the screen flashed in the top right to show how little ammo you have
[2:53:36] <AMUSERNAME> Halo CAN'T kill this DansGame
[2:53:43] <%doomerskeletor13> @riogascar I disagree honestly, they were a little too esoteric. The newer ones are more available and still optional. Much better imo
[2:53:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> NO. NO IDIOT. FLOOD IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT
[2:53:43] <+Juriasu> a lot of problems to deal with right now
[2:53:47] <%brachydios777> Which is why its the Ark
[2:53:48] <%Gruhunchously> Are you sure that's the correct priorities?
[2:53:50] <%M3djedx> veiWow
[2:53:54] <voodoolawyer> hmm .. the ARK escapes the FLOOD ...

[2:54:37] <%kingdovachief> WOOLIE YOUR KILLING ELITES
[2:54:39] <MoshPitMoira> Wait, so do the halo rings also straight up kill the Flood, or does it kill everything else, but leaves them intact and they just starve out?
[2:54:39] <%Gruhunchously> WE GOTTA LOOK OUT FOR OUR OWN
[2:54:40] <letshavecakes> I like how the flood just explode into chicken nuggets
[2:54:42] <@Menitta> let the bodies hit the floor
[2:54:43] <%The_Swedish_X> I used a lot of duel plasma during the last missions
[2:54:44] <+BishopBain> It's fine, all aliens look the same. Kappa
[2:54:45] <%subjectg> @lewdskeletor13 i actually like the esotericism of the H3 terminals alot, really sells the mystique of a civilization far beyond our time
[2:54:46] <%BisoromiBear> remember the billions they killed
[2:54:47] <+relay_01> Woolie leaving marines and killing teammates
[2:54:48] <BreakersAweigh> look at this pile LUL
[2:54:49] <%RioGascar> @lewdskeletor13 I disagree with it as well, cause they also said they expected everyone to skip arbys sections and hate him cause they didnt watch the cutscene. Bungie at times has realistic expectations of the player and sometimes overly pessimistic
[2:54:50] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AMUSERNAME
[2:54:51] <+QueequegTheater> YES YOU DID
[2:54:52] <Torivore> I thought "Two Betrayals" was in CE
[2:54:53] <%kingdovachief> WOOLIE IS INFECTED
[2:54:54] <SirDogBear> they would have survived if they had more honor
[2:54:54] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Do all aliens look the same to you Woolie? WutFace
[2:54:55] <+Creggamonsta> halo rings kill everything
[2:54:56] <voodoolawyer> these LPs make way more sense when you remember fighting games are built upon telegraphing moves
[2:54:58] <Fang_of_Yeenoghu> John Halo likes to watch
[2:54:59] <andresisant> You did man
[2:55:00] <+ntfth> @MoshPitMoira Bungie kinda abandoned the starve portion.
[2:55:01] <%raven_frame> You did shoot him a little.
[2:55:01] <andresisant> Betrayal
[2:55:02] <DPmusique> @Torivore LOL
[2:55:02] <prime_name> You totally killed some
[2:55:06] <Redmannasah> You super killed a friendly elite
[2:55:07] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @moshpitmoira the latter. the flood is basically impossible to totally kill so the only way to kill them is to starve them
[2:55:08] <Sp3ctre48> Nah, Halo rings kill anything that the flood is capable of infecting, so they basically starve
[2:55:13] <+Creggamonsta> all llife that could be infected by flood
[2:55:14] <DomunDomunDomun> "I didn't shoot him" - Woolie, after shooting an elite in the face with a shotgun
[2:55:15] <Saffry_Ruzin> You lie, that was cold blooded murder
[2:55:15] <AMUSERNAME> Gee, it sure would be good to have an ally to shoot all the flood bodies! Kappa
[2:55:17] <+mans51> goomba stomp em
[2:55:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Imagine Paige playing this
[2:55:23] <%Karkatstoaster> Can I just say, the concept of anyone continuing to fight after taking a plasma shot is fucking ridiculous. That‚Äôs like. Compressed superheated Star matter
[2:55:25] <+QueequegTheater> @BallerSwagBro9k no
[2:55:25] <%krispen_wa> ENEMY STEP
[2:55:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @MoshPitMoira okay it basically sends out a pulse that hits everything. if it detects neural activity beyond a certain level of "complexity" indicating "this is not an animal this is a people" then it will kill
[2:55:28] <Nomad94> @BallerSwagBro9k I'd rather not
[2:55:28] <%Holycow8498> Woolie Goomba stomped the flood
[2:55:30] <+kd2jag> Don't think Woolz has seen the fire grenades yet
[2:55:30] <TEEron11> yeah you totally killed that guy though
[2:55:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:55:34] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus you literally maulered him from behind lol
[2:55:38] <badlander2019> woolieSHOOK
[2:55:46] <%doomerskeletor13> @subjectg The way they‚Äôre written is fine, just hiding them or making them time sense was a poor design choice and makes people not want to read important information
[2:55:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> @MoshPitMoira and might also kill Graveminds and reduce flood to being feral or something.
[2:55:50] <voodoolawyer> @BallerSwagBro9k "Halo is you? But ... Halo is baba..."
[2:55:52] <%M3djedx> cosmoAyaya
[2:55:53] <%raven_frame> It is, Woolie enemy stepped a Hunter before.
[2:56:00] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @karkatstoaster the covenant weapons are absolutely fucked and every piece of media outside of the games make them seem like the worst thing possible

[2:56:27] <%kulmoth> woolie is brave for trusting the AI
[2:56:27] <+portlandsunshine> The quick answer is that the pulse only kills Flood at a certain level- like, it'll do a Gravemind no problem, but not lower forms like Infectors.
[2:56:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LETS GOOOOOOOO
[2:56:29] <%Superspider51> he's letting the AI drive

[2:56:35] <%M3djedx> veiD oh boy
[2:56:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> @MoshPitMoira but that's temporary and you could kill the entire flood down to 1 spore, and then let that spore reestablish infection and make a new Gravemind and that new Gravemind will remember everything the old ones did. There's only one gravemind really
[2:56:36] <%Dean_Inbetween> LETS FUCKIN GO

[2:57:08] <%subjectg> @lewdskeletor13 in fairness, the time sensitive bits are far less important than the rest of the info, and i feel they wanted the terminals to be a nugget of surprise for the people who WANTED to find them. The others who were there for the gameplay would not need or want to know anyway
[2:57:11] <%Karkatstoaster> @lewdskeletor13 it spins into a neat shape
[2:57:12] <$Rumbutt> This level goes through the environments of Silent Cartographer, Halo, and finally AoTC/Two Betrayals, from Halo 1, it's cool.

[3:08:14] <%Bonerlord911> how could i have kNOWN
[3:08:15] <SovPho> I would say that it's not so much the war that has three sides that are aligning but the circumstances of being Arbie 'n' the Chief require them to have temporary allegiances.

[3:09:04] <voodoolawyer> @The_Swedish_X not a snowball's chance in hell
[3:09:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @The_Swedish_X probably not because its annoying and you basically nee to look it up
[3:09:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gravemind understands the situation, and everything else
[3:09:22] <Talinu> Also ecause you need a human to stop the activation. Gravemind literally can't do it himself.
[3:09:24] <+CptnCampy61> Who remembers the secret jumps in this room?

[3:14:53] <%Bigyanno> That hammer is the correct weapon for this section
[3:14:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Superspider51 i mean, do we know how long the charge up time is for the rings? It's basically "exactly as long as the final fight in Halo 2 is, plus ~5 seconds?" right? Like the implicaiton is that that abort-energy signal got there JUST in time?
[3:14:56] <+Walopoh> IT'S SPOOKY TIME SourPls
[3:14:56] <SixthSun2> Oh no, Brute Flood DansGame

[3:14:57] <+Juriasu> SourPls the flood is bringing the beats SourPls
[3:15:07] <+donkeypunch720> Alien Facehuggers are so much cooler parasites than the Flood

[3:15:11] <%DianaTheAscian> shot gun
[3:15:13] <%Slimshazbot> The elctronic aspects of Halo's soundtracks are super underrated compared to the orchestral.
[3:15:18] <XxBigNerdxX> I hope v brings up how you get the skull in this level
[3:15:18] <%Superspider51> @LiquidDinosaur imagine that elevator ride would have taken the same amount of time as the startup
[3:15:20] <Kotyc_> pop
[3:15:25] <+Juriasu> the br firing with the beat Kreygasm
[3:15:28] <+portlandsunshine> !uptime
[3:15:29] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 37 minutes
[3:15:30] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @liquiddinosaur the chargeup time is just long enough that chief can look super cool stopping it, like the covenant bomb in 2
[3:15:31] <%Karkatstoaster> @donkeypunch720 you‚Äôre wrong but ok
[3:15:32] <%Javaa01> You can also just hammer them for the same effecrt
[3:15:32] <dinnydanny777> There's something about looping repetitive music that's so creepy
[3:15:38] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus V explain how you ge tthe skull here
[3:15:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Superspider51 What the Heretic Base elevator?
[3:15:43] <%yhom_tork> monkaS music
[3:15:43] <infernalram> drop the br for flood sections
[3:15:46] <%The_Swedish_X> in the old games
[3:15:51] <%Superspider51> @LiquidDinosaur no the elevator Chief and Arby were on
[3:15:56] <coracor> good boy sentinels
[3:16:01] <+TheShisno> Sentinel back-up!
[3:16:04] <+CammerTime21> I imagine that the ark would have had a longer time to fire, it was a safe location so they weren't rushing it
[3:16:07] <+Juriasu> the brute shot is straight up op vs the flood in this game
[3:16:09] <%Bigyanno> Spiker is also infinite sword, but not as good a sword as brute shot
[3:16:15] <dinnydanny777> Carbine is great
[3:16:16] <maznuts> woolie playing more BIBLE GAMES
[3:16:17] <%Holycow8498> What is combat dialog the flood has i noticed the gravemind can speak through them
[3:16:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> @donkeypunch720 i like headcrabs and Infection forms in different ways. I like how with Flood Combat forms the head is superfluous and every flood elite neck is just lolling back because who cares
[3:16:24] <%RioGascar> And so the sentinels back us up while the flood betray us
[3:16:29] <%Superspider51> Miranda showing up delayed the startup just enough for Chief and Arby to get to the platform in time
[3:16:30] <voodoolawyer> fun fact: spiker and brute shot can 2-hit melee the mongoose to death
[3:16:35] <+mans51> LUL

[3:17:20] <%Karkatstoaster> I prefer the flood because it‚Äôs personal. While I love eldritch horror, there‚Äôs something about the eldritch horror being very specifically interested in murdering you, and shit talking yiu

[3:19:56] <Minerslovegames> Hope you're ready for a fun time.
[3:19:56] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Master Chief should ditch Cortana and get with a nice Japanese anime AI girl that will treat him right.
[3:19:57] <%Slimshazbot> Lots of matte paintings in this game
[3:19:57] <mankeymania> are we finishing this?

[3:20:01] <mcarora19> WORST LEVEL
[3:20:01] <Futurecity10> Fuck this level
[3:20:03] <+Walopoh> The forerunners basically solved all possible technology
[3:20:03] <%DukeAtomic> They did a full restoration
[3:20:05] <Sp3ctre48> This is basically the Library 2.0
[3:20:05] <+eggypigeon> This level terrified me as a kid man
[3:20:06] <Gallhint> This level is a nightmare on Legendary
[3:20:06] <%DensityD> !uptime

[3:20:56] <+TheShisno> Laso runners are gigachad, but at what cost
[3:20:56] <%Bigyanno> There's one specific part of this mission that can just fuck RIGHT OFF
[3:20:56] <mujahideenfruityrebels> This level on any difficulty is ResidentSleeper
[3:20:57] <badlander2019> Its the worst level overall

[3:21:02] <OldOnyx> Welcome back to high charity things may have changed a bit
[3:21:02] <garbageheaphound> I still wake up screaming from it sometimes
[3:21:03] <black_pariah> this level beat my ass on normal
[3:21:03] <TrigglyPuf> Omfg this level on legendary
[3:21:03] <ZeroCruz> Its alright
[3:21:04] <$Kirby_Sauce> this was the first stage i did on legendary
[3:21:04] <Onatamana> so easy to get lost the instant you lose track of the path
[3:21:06] <+Msytic6> It took two days for me
[3:21:06] <%Superspider51> finished this level solo on legendary like 2 weeks ago and it was alright
[3:21:06] <+donkeypunch720> Nah Library is still worse, literally copy pasted rooms X 30
[3:21:08] <%krispen_wa> IT'S BUNGIE STUDIOS
[3:21:09] <+Walopoh> It also fires ALL THE RINGS
[3:21:09] <+Orenalos> a true test of friendship this level is
[3:21:10] <+novacrusader727> OH WERE DOING THIS ONE TOO?!
[3:21:11] <%Pinkiefan> Laso on this level is not fun
[3:21:11] <HereComestheChief> Why must you REMIND ME OF THE PAIN NotLikeThis
[3:21:12] <$Kirby_Sauce> BIG MISTAKE
[3:21:13] <AppleBerryKitty> also there's a sword at the stop at the start of this level that I have 0 clue how to get
[3:21:13] <%spacebowie749> this was hell on legendary
[3:21:14] <zanzibarian_hamster> Do they explain what rampant AIs are in Halo or is it just a Marathon thing?
[3:21:15] <stachystat> just running is a pretty good idea
[3:21:18] <%The_Swedish_X> why doesn't he have a shotgun?
[3:21:19] <%subjectg> legendary is fine, but laso is pretty fucked
[3:21:19] <%Goraka91> It's like the control tower or something
[3:21:20] <correctedsun117> No, the Ark is the Ark
[3:21:22] <%brachydios777> They built a teleporter on Earth
[3:21:23] <%Javaa01> The "Arc" on earth was just a teleporter ro the real thing
[3:21:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Multi-purpose Ark
[3:21:24] <Flightedwings> Weeks V, it took me and my brother weeks to beat this on Legendary
[3:21:28] <prime_name> Halo 4 explains Rampant
[3:21:28] <+TheShisno> Builds Halo, portal to Earth, on Africa... the cradle of Humanity
[3:21:28] <AppleBerryKitty> the top*
[3:21:28] <Minerslovegames> It's not a bad level, I rather enjoy it, but it is BRUTAL on the higher difficulties.
[3:21:31] <PlushMines> I had so much more problems with this level than the library
[3:21:32] <twoah> We all know the hallway of death all too well
[3:21:32] <+novacrusader727> Are we finishing the fight today?!
[3:21:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @voodoolawyer Halo CE ends September 22, 2552, this game ends December 11th 2552
[3:21:35] <+YabbaTroll> @zanzibarian_hamster its a big plot point in 4
[3:21:46] <LoganPayne> The idea that even the walls and floors are the skin and bodies of the dead is nightmarish
[3:21:49] <dinnydanny777> This level is also, absolutely disgusting
[3:21:50] <DigitalJoshie> eeww

[3:22:39] <%wunp_fxs> memories of prey
[3:22:40] <%Goraka91> When you think that this used to be a city ship it really puts the Flood in perspective huh
[3:22:41] <%brachydios777> @mnzion 2
[3:22:41] <dinnydanny777> Woolie you know that the Carbine has a zoom right???

[3:24:06] <+jeasybakeoven> they should have just given gravemind several VAs but all at once
[3:24:07] <%RioGascar> It‚Äôs possible they had a cold cause that happened a lot when recording halo apparently
[3:24:10] <%yhom_tork> yeah gravemind sounds so much better in 2

[3:30:15] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine being so massive that there are literal ground battlers between different factions happening inside your body
[3:30:22] <voodoolawyer> for example, the pyloric sphincter is in your stomach!

[3:33:58] <%wunp_fxs> very first book
[3:33:58] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Halsey flipped a coin and picked chief based on it right
[3:34:00] <%huskarl_zap> i.saw an animation about coins
[3:34:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'll explain that one in a dono.
[3:34:02] <%Holycow8498> Its just a reference to the fall of reach the Halo 1 tie in novel
[3:34:02] <DigitalJoshie> BIG book stuff

[3:34:08] <%huskarl_zap> the shekels fault
[3:34:08] <%Superspider51> @kingdovachief When Halsey first contacted Chief when he was 6. She had him guess heads or tails 5 times and he called it every time
[3:34:08] <dinnydanny777> If you back up an AI is it the same AI?
[3:34:10] <%DarkestVegemite> a literal coin if i remember correctly
[3:34:10] <%raven_frame> Will coin become the new Cole Protocol?
[3:34:11] <weirdmothgirl> The decision to abduct john was based on a coin flip, to test his "luck"
[3:34:11] <+CammerTime21> It's how Chief was selected, thats as low spoiler as it gets
[3:34:12] <%shadowsofpain> One word answer. Luck
[3:34:14] <%Bigyanno> @themanski_90 Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:34:15] <jaygee303> Halsey‚Äôs first interaction with chief as a kid
[3:34:17] <Sp3ctre48> Oh yeah they flipped a coin and that decided whether to pick Chief for the Spartan Program I think
[3:34:19] <+Freeborg1997> The very first book
[3:34:20] <+TheShisno> Halo manga
[3:34:21] <Savatewolf> John the Ultimate lucky student
[3:34:22] <FiendishlyInventive> It's the coin (REDACTED) flipped to choose John to become a Spartan.
[3:34:24] <%doomerskeletor13> A backup is just a copy, it might have the same base mind but it won‚Äôt be the same being
[3:34:26] <Depthcharge2030> "So you like King of the Hill huh? Well, have you heard of this neat game called slayer?"
[3:34:27] <%seniormeatbox> DON'T POP THE PODS
[3:34:27] <+portlandsunshine> For a studio that openly hated the books, Bungie made a real point of quoting from them here
[3:34:34] <resloxxx> RETHORICAL QUESTIONS
[3:34:41] <dinnydanny777> Shit I completely forgot that Haloman is literally canonically just lucky
[3:34:41] <undercoverbarber> woolie cant do that
[3:34:41] <prime_name> Clear CHat!
[3:34:47] <dinnydanny777> Halomans is Lucky Ted
[3:34:47] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @superc37 shut the fuck up
[3:34:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> Doesn't Chief still have the coin? Since its super antique and from 20th century Earth?
[3:34:56] <voodoolawyer> Halsey updated Windows 10 to create Cortana

[3:35:40] <Akett> Damn they were shooting over the "Don't look at me!"
[3:35:42] <DomunDomunDomun> The luck thing is also a bit of a reference to the novel ringworld.
[3:35:49] <alrobot2014> @voodoolawyer change your desktop region to cuba it works as a stopgap
[3:35:54] <+thfiddles> why do the shooty things have so much fucking health
[3:35:56] <%Bonerlord911> go get the flamethrower
[3:35:56] <%doomerskeletor13> The coin thing is just a reference to Fall of Reach
[3:35:57] <%superc37> @reverend_roscoe and if this thing woolie already knows never comes up in the games?
[3:35:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> @portlandsunshine no in the book its taken from him in boot camp but is given back years later. So like, idk it might be in one of his belt pouches or something
[3:36:00] <dinnydanny777> Is it reassuring that Cortana is a crazed AI in Halo but she's also the voice of computers now?
[3:36:03] <%Gruhunchously> Did you just walk over Dual Maulers?
[3:36:08] <AppleBerryKitty> this is why i just ran passed it all and wait to use my stealth camo
[3:36:17] <%krispen_wa> @dinnydanny777 depends if you consider halo 5 canon

[3:36:49] <dinnydanny777> They wallhugging
[3:36:53] <%RioGascar> Wonder if its human speech backwards and other shit
[3:36:57] <%Slimshazbot> @RioGascar Usually fleshy noises are by squishing fruits
[3:37:01] <+RicardoRuizr> They camping
[3:37:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> In 2525, Franklin Mendez returned the quarter to John as a going-away present as their paths diverged.[1] The ultimate fate of the quarter is unknown
[3:37:03] <%brachydios777> @krispen_wa I know it‚Äôs bad but we can‚Äôt ignore it happened
[3:37:05] <+portlandsunshine> You should always consider 5 canon. Like it or not, it's part of the series. Denying it won't make it go away.
[3:37:06] <%Bigyanno> Hey Woolie, imagine if they didn't have someone else to shoot at
[3:37:09] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Do you want the answers about the A.I. back ups or are you doing the "Don't give me answers but i'm gonna bitch about not knowing."?

[3:37:48] <%superc37> @reverend_roscoe i dont think woolie is going to lp he books my dude. also again, he is already aware that cortana was based off of a human mind, so stating it again is hardly a spoiler.

[3:39:14] <%seniormeatbox> @Nomad94 half of this chat says otherwise, unfortunately
[3:39:17] <dinnydanny777> What do I do
[3:39:18] <+MagiKestral> 5 is one that seems like it faltered
[3:39:18] <%huskarl_zap> its code
[3:39:24] <+Ropcord> 4 is fuckin great fight me
[3:39:25] <%Superspider51> nah Halo 4 has some good shit in it
[3:39:25] <Nomad94> @seniormeatbox half is not "nobody", unfortunately
[3:39:28] <+portlandsunshine> @kronostorm34 They did a fine job building off this lore. People got angry because it didn't fit certain fan assumptions.
[3:39:29] <Jaku2011> 4 Isn't bad only 5 is bad
[3:39:30] <+duskrush> oh wow, already in High Charity, huh?
[3:39:33] <+duskrush> they could finish this today
[3:39:36] <%doomerskeletor13> 5 is the one no one likes
[3:39:37] <+portlandsunshine> 4 is the most HUMAN story they've ever had in a Halo.
[3:39:39] <%Slimshazbot> Most of people's complaints with 4 weren't from THAT part of the storyline, it was from the other part. I'd elaborate, but spoilers.
[3:39:39] <Nomad94> 5 also has its moments here and there
[3:39:41] <%huskarl_zap> I hate cortana tbh shouldnt be the center of the universe
[3:39:41] <%Gruhunchously> Halo 4 has some of the best and the worst writing in the series
[3:39:42] <%AlexandriasFolly> 4 Is a decent first attempt. 5 was a garbage fire
[3:39:46] <zocano> Even 5 has some really good levels in it
[3:39:48] <black_pariah> plenty people like 4, vocal bungie purists aren't the whole community theyre just loud
[3:39:48] <%Holycow8498> 4 is mixed amongst most Halo fans
[3:39:51] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @ropcord Great game, I just found the story forgettable
[3:39:53] <dinnydanny777> There was a guy right behind you
[3:39:56] <letshavecakes> 4 dumped a lot of stuff players weren
[3:39:59] <dinnydanny777> 4 Was alright
[3:40:02] <letshavecakes> 't familiar with
[3:40:03] <%timjpink> timjpink subscribed at Tier 1.
[3:40:05] <Minerslovegames> I enjoyed 4 and I'll fight all of you. @portlandsunshine puts it best, it's the best Human story.
[3:40:06] <%Superspider51> lol I watched that red dot run right up behind him
[3:40:06] <voodoolawyer> Halo REACH though, that game was the tits
[3:40:10] <Jaku2011> There is nothing redeeming about 5's campaing
[3:40:11] <+duskrush> the strategy is run like a coward
[3:40:11] <+portlandsunshine> 5 has cool ideas but did sadly trip over its own armored dick.
[3:40:12] <%superc37> i like how, despite all disagreements, we can all agree that halo 5 is fuckin shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
[3:40:14] <dinnydanny777> The last boss of 4 is dogshit but other than that it was fine
[3:40:16] <Joestar1890> The main villain from 4 is such a big nothing tho
[3:40:16] <%krispen_wa> Halo 4 had THICC Cortana. That alone makes it good
[3:40:16] <+Ropcord> LUL
[3:40:21] <%Holycow8498> 4's problem was its multiplayer its campaign was really good
[3:40:22] <+Ragnakawaii> I enjoyed 4's multiplayer
[3:40:27] <dinnydanny777> Cortana is so thicc in 4
[3:40:27] <%BubbaGAN0USH> did you kill him for sport or ammunition
[3:40:30] <voodoolawyer> ^^ duality of man lol
[3:40:33] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, I don't thing many people are going to step up to defend Halo 5
[3:40:33] <+thfiddles> 4 feels really repetitive gameplay wise, i‚Äôd like it a lot more if it didn‚Äôt feel like half the game was plugging into knights with promethean guns
[3:40:34] <%doomerskeletor13> 5 was so bad they‚Äôre practically ignoring it for Infinite
[3:40:35] <undercoverbarber> Fucking blind
[3:40:37] <+Ragnakawaii> lol
[3:40:38] <xxshadowxx416> halo 5 is a dmc 2 it so close to a good game
[3:40:38] <FiendishlyInventive> That range's no good Woolie
[3:40:39] <letshavecakes> 4's bigger writing problems was the humans tbh
[3:40:40] <dinnydanny777> Cortana is wide in 4
[3:40:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> 4 Retconned the big "reveal" of Halo 3 among other things which I imagine would upset or divide the playerbase
[3:40:45] <%Bigyanno> I think I deal with this room with a cloak that's around somewhere
[3:40:49] <%Bigyanno> just run through
[3:40:49] <zocano> 4 is a decent story but I find most of its level design boring
[3:40:54] <Sullry> shes got feet in 4 Kreygasm
[3:40:55] <%MacabreOpus> Throw a grenade!
[3:40:56] <zocano> Encounter design
[3:40:56] <%seniormeatbox> Cortana isn't any more or less thicc in 4, they just gave her baby face cheeks
[3:40:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheRealGreaterGamer the Big Reveal already contradicts the Terminals
[3:41:00] <voodoolawyer> glad to see Woolie actually using the AR
[3:41:01] <%Holycow8498> I mean that's just halo 2's problem @zocano
[3:41:03] <TedLives> i enjoy 5's multiplayer bust despise its joke of a story
[3:41:05] <DeepSearch27> Woolie was about to shoot V
[3:41:08] <prince_johnny_> 4 weapons suck
[3:41:09] <%doomerskeletor13> @therealgreatergamer No it didn‚Äôt. Sigh. People really don‚Äôt understand that was already established by Bungie
[3:41:09] <%raven_frame> What's a bits leader?
[3:41:11] <+portlandsunshine> @TheRealGreaterGamer It didn't retcon it. People assumed it meant one thing, Bungie didn't say either way, and 343 decided what it meant
[3:41:12] <%spacebowie749> cant give spoilers if chats arguing about 4 and 5
[3:41:18] <%huskarl_zap> @seniormeatbox definitely wrong
[3:41:19] <%unclekulikov> Feather the Assault Rifle trigger for more accuracy.
[3:41:25] <+mans51> ResidentSleeper sooo manhy
[3:41:25] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @prince_johnny_ The saw was cool
[3:41:25] <+GlewmanIII> God fuck this mission
[3:41:28] <%Pinkiefan> The bullet spounges in halo 4 made it boring. Maybe I ruined the experience by playing on legendary, but I have always gone through on legendary.
[3:41:28] <zocano> And I think similarly of 2 @holycow8498
[3:41:29] <%Holycow8498> Halo 4 has the most linear campaign since Halo 2
[3:41:29] <%AlexandriasFolly> 5 pissed me off
[3:41:29] <+GlewmanIII> it's so lame
[3:41:30] <%AriaMeloetta> Best way to describe Halo 5 is that it ruined Halo 4 story

[3:41:58] <%BisoromiBear> TheIlluminati
[3:41:58] <%raven_frame> I had a rough time of it.
[3:41:59] <%spacebowie749> ya
[3:42:09] <prince_johnny_> @mujahideenfruityrebels true. But i mean i played 4 on legendary and most of the weapons were shit
[3:42:11] <%jorniev> last of us 2 is just an ok game
[3:42:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Wow, I've never heard that before. Like I said, 4 divided people lol
[3:42:13] <letshavecakes> I wish the flood were as fun to fight as they are to read and think about
[3:42:13] <+freelancer_960> halo 5 is good depending on your priorities with the series, Story wise it aint the greatest, MP wise tho, a lot of people like it
[3:42:15] <%superc37> imagine if you could dual wield sword+gun
[3:42:15] <SABiscotti> s-word
[3:42:16] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @portlandsunshine I can't believe no one's spoiled that John Halo is Arbiters father yet -woops shit
[3:42:16] <%huskarl_zap> Woolie is struggling and chat is just slamming fists and throwing poop over 4 and 5 MaxLOL
[3:42:16] <%doomerskeletor13> I can‚Äôt go into cause of spoilers, but people get mad at 343i for a decision that came from Bungie lmao
[3:42:17] <@Menitta> At least I know a little bit about Halo 4's story, enough to mod this discussion
[3:42:26] <+QueequegTheater> @jorniev Oh I'm not brave enough for politics
[3:42:28] <Torivore> The good parts of 4 were partially undone by 5. To me 343 were so busy over correcting their gameplay for 5 that the story was basically an afterthought
[3:42:36] <stinkydinks> Last of Us 2 is the best game this gen after Bloodborne dspHmm
[3:42:37] <%wunp_fxs> thats a good point
[3:42:39] <%sssoapy> They don't know that
[3:42:39] <TedLives> yeah 5's story shat all over what 4 was attempting to tackle with john
[3:42:43] <penitentpentwitch> Good meatloaf though
[3:42:48] <%Goraka91> Nah everyone in 40k is a bad guy LUL
[3:42:49] <+greatgetter> I don't think they care
[3:42:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> ANUS DOOR
[3:42:50] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @prince_johnny_ That‚Äôs true, the original trilogy had a lot more heavy hitters
[3:42:50] <+Orenalos> nah tyranids are BAD
[3:42:51] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Conflicting stories from multiple developers complicates things as well lol
[3:42:52] <Incrodon> Only Cowards don't use creep
[3:42:52] <Jaku2011> @Torivore I agree with this
[3:42:52] <+Doruben> or anus doors
[3:42:54] <+xdeathknightx> Woolie supports the empire in Starcraft 2 Kappa
[3:42:54] <AMUSERNAME> Tyranids are good bois

[3:44:42] <%jorniev> last of us 2 is too long
[3:44:42] <zocano> Halo 5 has some really damn decent encounter design that I will stand by
[3:44:43] <%ChoculaUltra> I would actually be concerned if one didn't have an anus door.
[3:44:43] <TrigglyPuf> LOL PUNCH THAT BIG FLOOD
[3:44:45] <%huskarl_zap> Mek:LOOK WHAT I MADE BOSS" Boss: Looks like a butthole.
[3:44:45] <+Freeborg1997> Can't believe Gravemind renovated his house to have anus doors, so tacky.

[3:45:06] <%Andrizzleton> Woolie letting it slip that he doens't have an anus door atpCap
[3:45:08] <$whiskeybuisness> fire indeed hot
[3:45:10] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah...I remember the campaigns being a lot longer than this
[3:45:11] <%Bigyanno> there are very few fire grenades in the game
[3:45:12] <%seniormeatbox> The Flood HATES fire super hard
[3:45:13] <dinnydanny777> It's really easy to fall here
[3:45:13] <xxshadowxx416> halo 5 gameplay ok it writing the worst
[3:45:14] <Sp3ctre48> Halo 3 feels short compared to 2 because it's levels don't drag on forever
[3:45:16] <%sssoapy> ???
[3:45:19] <+TheShisno> OOUGH
[3:45:25] <%huskarl_zap> Woolie anus confirmed cant shut PogChamp
[3:45:29] <prime_name> Was he a nice flood?
[3:45:29] <%krispen_wa> The Ark felt pretty long
[3:45:30] <TrigglyPuf> LOL
[3:45:32] <+thfiddles> so is the four player run of this game the canon one? considering that the player 3 and 4 elites have their own book?
[3:45:34] <%seniormeatbox> @Sp3ctre48 also because there's only 8 levels not counting the tutorial and epilogue
[3:45:37] <+duskrush> We all have anus doors inside us
[3:45:40] <+duskrush> Ducks don't
[3:45:40] <@Menitta> Halo 3 has less levels ]
[3:45:42] <%Gruhunchously> Now it's starting to look a bit like Xen
[3:45:43] <undercoverbarber> Killed friendly? FeelsBadMan
[3:45:44] <TheAspiringWriter> Good thing the story ends after 3. Nothing else happened.
[3:45:47] <+freelancer_960> @zocano I agree, strictly gameplay wise 5 hit it out of the park
[3:45:47] <%subjectg> It‚Äôs short because there‚Äôs fewer levels in H3, and you can bang these games pretty quick on coop
[3:45:47] <%lioan515> Woolie has no anus doors
[3:45:47] <zocano> Halo 3 is just short which is not a bad thing
[3:45:48] <maskedmustelid> The Jumanji drums!
[3:45:53] <voodoolawyer> @thfiddles bluey and headward have their own books?
[3:45:53] <Onatamana> @Pinkiefan Creep is the organic goop that covers everything. It takes its name from the Zerg creep in Starcraft, which is the material that Zerg needs to spread in order to build their bases.

[3:45:57] <%Goraka91> @black0193 Speaking of which, Destiny with the Vex and Guardians, they exist in all timelines and know what will happen but the Not-Spartans still kick their ass because they ignore causality LUL

[3:46:04] <%doomerskeletor13> @theaspiringwriter Nope lots of stuff happened, good stuff too
[3:46:05] <Kotyc_> they didn't have time to complete halo 2 so they probably had that in mind when making 3
[3:46:10] <%krispen_wa> CORTANA Kreygasm
[3:46:11] <+portlandsunshine> Halo 3 was planned to be the back half of 2. It's why its short.

[3:51:44] <%raven_frame> Woolie was going to jump dude.
[3:51:45] <%RioGascar> @liquiddinosaur Good question. Bungie had a answer and it was basically telling marty to stop asking questions when he askted that in the halo ce commentary

[3:51:56] <+QueequegTheater> @threeheadedwalrus yes
[3:51:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 she's putting a lot of faith into the idea that the New Installation 4 would use the same key
[3:51:59] <%Bigyanno> Halo 2 callback much?
[3:52:01] <SABiscotti> YEE
[3:52:04] <Akett> Shooting them works too.
[3:52:06] <ralphfromdk> Woolie seems to lose all sense of anything when he plays a first person game, it's really weird :l
[3:52:07] <%Gruhunchously> The...high charity, if you will
[3:52:07] <%Andrizzleton> you can just 2 shot them with a brute shot

[3:52:16] <%RioGascar> Or 2
[3:52:19] <%krispen_wa> You know, maybe Gravemind deciding to put everything he had onto High Charity was probably not a smart idea
[3:52:20] <%The_Swedish_X> time to run
[3:52:21] <%condemned_15> woolie go
[3:52:21] <%Goraka91> Please

[3:53:00] <MoshPitMoira> What up, my name is Woolie, I'm 17, and I never fuckin learned how to read
[3:53:01] <ralphfromdk> LiquidDinosaur This time, it's a city's reactor :D still a flying space city, but hey.
[3:53:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @black_pariah He removed his sharingan after finishing Naruto
[3:53:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously that's how i want to go
[3:53:09] <%huskarl_zap> @gruhunchously again
[3:53:13] <%doomerskeletor13> @krispen_wa This game is cool but it very obviously had a lot of rewrites and writing issues. Chief among them is Gravemind not living up to his original introduction from 2
[3:53:14] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:53:15] <%Holycow8498> You know the flood walls are actually very creepy
[3:53:18] <%Bigyanno> @LiquidDinosaur No I mean the part in 2 when the arbiter cut 3 large round things in a room to solve the problem
[3:53:21] <RetributionP> run woolie run!
[3:53:28] <%threeheadedwalrus> is Chief gonna be in MS Flight Simulator 2020?
[3:53:32] <letshavecakes> Gravemind could just block off the exits and there'd be nothing you could do about it
[3:53:33] <%sssoapy> WutFace
[3:53:33] <dinnydanny777> Look out for tentacles dude
[3:53:38] <dinnydanny777> Don't get Hentai'd
[3:53:38] <%subjectg> So there‚Äôs a super cool moment in singleplayer where arbiter shows up with a flamethrower and it‚Äôs such a bro moment
[3:53:42] <%MajoraZ> @krispen_wa @lewdskeletor13 Truth's entitre change in personality and motivation is even worse IMO
[3:53:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Bigyanno ok blow up a ship engine or cut a orbital station's tethers. Also if he got in trouble for letting Halo be destroyed why were they ok with him destroying another forerunner building
[3:53:55] <%huskarl_zap> So gates found OS but what about when he worked at apple and apple stole from IBM?
[3:54:00] <+YabbaTroll> wat
[3:54:02] <PoggieB> Holy shit what
[3:54:03] <%Slimshazbot> WUT

[3:54:08] <prime_name> GLITCHED
[3:54:08] <coracor> what was that flood made out of
[3:54:08] <%Goraka91> @Holycow8498 Specefically because this used to be a high tech city and all the meat is from corpses
[3:54:08] <%krispen_wa> IMMORTAL
[3:54:09] <alrobot2014> immortal
[3:54:09] <Fang_of_Yeenoghu> The Flood god
[3:54:09] <+portlandsunshine> @lewdskeletor13 Originally, most of this game was supposed to be the back half of Halo 2. They had to do a lot of frantic rewrites and changes, and had to even through some of that out when they had to cut levels.
[3:54:10] <%brachydios777> ???
[3:54:11] <+QueequegTheater> Randal the Flood Vandal
[3:54:12] <%Andrizzleton> too slow lol
[3:54:14] <black_pariah> HE WAS TOO STRONG
[3:54:15] <%raven_frame> Shield flood suck.
[3:54:16] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Range Woolie
[3:54:17] <%Slimshazbot> No that wasn't a shiled thing
[3:54:21] <%Bonerlord911> their shield resists it yeah
[3:54:22] <+KiwiRedgrave> The true arbirter right there
[3:54:22] <Torivore> One bad thing about co op is missing out on a really cool thing soon
[3:54:23] <%subjectg> This happens sometimes
[3:54:26] <%SQUASH_5> common bug, can happen to brute forms as well
[3:54:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DensityD no Grunt combat forms the just become flood meat
[3:54:27] <%Holycow8498> Nah it just glitched
[3:54:28] <letshavecakes> shielded enemies still get sworded in one hit, flood's just buff
[3:54:35] <weirdmothgirl> Have they said if they have plans to do ODST or Reach?
[3:54:39] <Onatamana> That must've been an honor guard elite in life
[3:54:39] <%The_Swedish_X> I've never seen that shield block that many hits
[3:54:44] <%Slimshazbot> @weirdmothgirl "maybe"
[3:54:45] <%doomerskeletor13> They haven‚Äôt said
[3:54:45] <+ntfth> Hinted at Reach but not confirmed.
[3:54:45] <+duskrush> use the shields to block the path behind you
[3:54:46] <%nxflre> unique singleplayer thing happens here
[3:54:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> @nxflre what arby shows up?
[3:54:57] <Second_Omega> Super
[3:55:00] <%Bigyanno> Through the gunge hole
[3:55:00] <%superc37> p sure they confirmed reach.
[3:55:00] <%Gruhunchously> Hot
[3:55:05] <%superc37> and odst.
[3:55:05] <dinnydanny777> Isn't ODST kind of weird
[3:55:09] <%Pinkiefan> Has he still not even seen a mauler?
[3:55:10] <%nxflre> ye @LiquidDinosaur
[3:55:12] <letshavecakes> Are either of those games even on the PC MCC yet
[3:55:13] <%superc37> dont see why they wouldn't
[3:55:15] <dinnydanny777> Like the progression in ODST is weird
[3:55:15] <%Gruhunchously> Through the assholes
[3:55:15] <KillMyPast> ODST is the best
[3:55:18] <%doomerskeletor13> Reach is
[3:55:20] <+portlandsunshine> @LiquidDinosaur They CAN make Grunt and Jackal combat forms if they're desperate, like in Halo Wars or some books, but on the Rings or the Arcs they're spoiled for choice
[3:55:23] <RetributionP> odst is just diffrent its super good
[3:55:26] <%Estuko> I love ODST lol
[3:55:26] <Nomad94> @Pinkiefan he used a mauler last mission
[3:55:26] <+duskrush> @LiquidDinosaur if you do this on single player you do the level alone right up until the end when arby shows up covering you as you run
[3:55:30] <SixthSun2> Wait, it's all assholes? Always has been.
[3:55:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait HOW did High Charity fly if the forerunner shiip was powring it?
[3:55:31] <%DensityD> what if there were Camo'd Shielded Flood Elites?
[3:55:32] <%spacebowie749> @pinkiefan he has, he likes them
[3:55:33] <%threeheadedwalrus> ODST has a sick soundtrack
[3:55:34] <%superc37> reach is on pc right now, and odst is coming later this month
[3:55:36] <%Bigyanno> It's very nice of gravemind to open his sphincters when chief is nearby
[3:55:38] <%DensityD> GOOD THROW
[3:55:39] <SABiscotti> PURGE THE MUTANT
[3:55:41] <%Gruhunchously> It's an asshole made of assholes
[3:55:42] <+MagiKestral> aww I'm sad she didn't say the line about arbiter cause of co op
[3:55:43] <%Slimshazbot> @LiquidDinosaur Shhhh
[3:55:45] <TechGamer> ODST to me at the time wasn't worth $70 but it was a good game
[3:55:55] <%eyezehuhh> @Pinkiefan Isn't a Mauler someone who thinks 11 hr youtube videos are thorough critiques?
[3:56:00] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur flood fart propulsion
[3:56:01] <prime_name> We'll get there
[3:56:04] <%The_Swedish_X> I frequently forget the smg is in this game
[3:56:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Slimshazbot this must be like emergency power. but emergency power i enough to do a slipspace jump out of the galaxy?
[3:56:09] <Namillus> Truth is dead, long live Truth
[3:56:11] <%krispen_wa> Why doesn't Gravemind just squish John with all the fungus?
[3:56:12] <+MagiKestral> @techgamer makes me glad I'll get it for free if I bought MCC for 30 bucks
[3:56:12] <%Slimshazbot> @LiquidDinosaur Also don't ask how the gravemind got off Delta Halo and onto high charity
[3:56:14] <black_pariah> @LiquidDinosaur ya know what, thats a good question
[3:56:14] <+Orenalos> schism
[3:56:16] <+portlandsunshine> @LiquidDinosaur It canonically has three or four backup generators as a just-in-case. they have cool names too, but I can't remember them
[3:56:17] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @eyezehuhh LMFAOOOO
[3:56:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Slimshazbot WAIT DID HIGH CHARITY FLY THROUGH EARTH'S PORTAL?
[3:56:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Is Woolie high? Or am I too used to watching him on 2x speed?
[3:56:19] <%Pinkiefan> ODST remains my favorite, though the save system is horrible.
[3:56:19] <Onatamana> Truth was televising the whole thing, so I assume lots of people know
[3:56:20] <penitentpentwitch> Floating empty chair? Oh boy!
[3:56:24] <%Bonerlord911> this is where arbiter would be with a flamethrower
[3:56:26] <+Walopoh> They're probably on Cloud 9 because he just livestreamed his victory
[3:56:26] <dinnydanny777> We killed the Pope? New Pope within a week

[3:56:48] <dinnydanny777> Cortana butt tho
[3:56:48] <+duskrush> @LiquidDinosaur nah, High Charity slipspaced to the Ark but Gravemind couldn't maintain the trajectory and crashed
[3:56:49] <%Gruhunchously> It's like the Pope died and the Vatican blew up
[3:56:49] <+OniOniOniiii> pope wars
[3:56:49] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @slimshazbot doesn't he get on a plane that crashes into high charity?
[3:56:51] <PoggieB> Isn't Regret still around?
[3:56:52] <%einherjarvalk> this was cooler in solo
[3:56:52] <dinnydanny777> Cortana cheeks tho
[3:56:52] <sniffy77> if u play this single player then the arbiter shows up at the end with a flamethrower
[3:56:54] <%subjectg> @slimshazbot that one‚Äôs pretty easy, mind transfer between hives would be sensible for a collective consciousness
[3:56:56] <%BisoromiBear> should have worn their class 14 skins
[3:56:58] <%krispen_wa> WHY DIDN'T GRAVEMIND DESTROY THAT?
[3:56:59] <%MacabreOpus> That teasing tentacle
[3:57:00] <KillMyPast> Cooler moment in solo
[3:57:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 @Slimshazbot but he could have easily sent like 2 flooded phantoms out behind him on Earth and eaten Earth
[3:57:01] <%Holycow8498> Regret is apart of the gravemind
[3:57:04] <dinnydanny777> No Hentai space ship
[3:57:05] <sniffy77> 99% of the prophet race is dead
[3:57:06] <%Andrizzleton> dat BootAI

[4:12:03] <%brave_sj> If Flood were a problem that could be solved with Sentinels we wouldn't need the Halo array
[4:12:04] <+TheShisno> Did the Forerunners have a Cole Protocol
[4:12:07] <%huskarl_zap> can we talk about what the flood are because they never come up in 4 and 5
[4:12:07] <%brachydios777> That‚Äôs a good question, one we‚Äôll NOT ANSWER
[4:12:07] <+smikeye> I hate those shooty floods
[4:12:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Pickle Stone
[4:12:09] <+novacrusader727> @krispen_wa I mean, imagine living for thousands of years and all of a sudden ONE DUDE gets this close to killing you. You‚Äôd drop your intimidating act real quick.
[4:12:10] <@Menitta> The Sentinel Beams do more damage against the flood right?
[4:12:11] <ripoffproductionsllc> I never saw Gravemind as being all that lovecraftian, it's just a smart thing borne of all the brains the Flood has eaten.
[4:12:11] <sniffy77> after centuries of study, the forerunners discovered that big lazers work agains the flood
[4:12:13] <Onatamana> I'm 50% sure sentinel lasers can be used as welding tools or something.
[4:12:15] <Mr_Strut> They were apparently dealing with this for 300 years
[4:12:17] <dinnydanny777> Spider Flood, Spider flood, does whatever a spider flood does
[4:12:19] <%Gruhunchously> Johnson
[4:12:22] <+Juriasu> johnson PogChamp
[4:12:29] <undercoverbarber> Spartan Laser Kreygasm
[4:12:39] <HereComestheChief> HOO RAH
[4:12:42] <Jaku2011> Johnson will surely not job with that laser!
[4:12:42] <Sp3ctre48> Well once the Flood had spread to thousands of worlds there was no realistic way to actually defeat them
[4:12:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> In a 300 year war, they must have invented more new shit than they ever had in their whole history.
[4:12:50] <LoganPayne> juked that pure form
[4:12:52] <%Garthunox> fun fact, you can get an infinite spartan laser here but I cant remember how exactly
[4:12:53] <letshavecakes> melee rush into assault rifle burst is some strong flood tech
[4:12:53] <%MaddyCaddy> He is a super soldier
[4:12:54] <+PhantomMiG> Woolie still refuses to melee
[4:12:54] <Pizza_Mezza> Johnson so cool isn‚Äôt he?
[4:12:54] <%Dean_Inbetween> The gravemind is only eldritch in blibical sense not really lovecraftian
[4:12:54] <%krispen_wa> So Gravemind is dealing with woolieONEGUY in universe chat that keeps spoiling everything?

[4:17:57] <%Superspider51> nope
[4:18:02] <dinnydanny777> Cole sees a Covenant, he shoots
[4:18:07] <+QueequegTheater> @AMUSERNAME He is pointedly refusing to melee with it
[4:18:08] <%subjectg> this fight is something else on legendary
[4:18:11] <%Gruhunchously> Hmmm it's almost like someone could make a multiplayer mode out of this.
[4:18:16] <%raven_frame> Survive V.

[4:18:46] <%huskarl_zap> Comparmentilization of info is not that rare
[4:18:47] <BlackDae> that's a cool reticle
[4:18:48] <Onatamana> Gravemind be like: "How can this BE"
[4:18:49] <%brave_sj> FLESH AND MIND AND üÖ±Ô∏è ONE
[4:18:50] <%Holycow8498> Gravemad
[4:18:53] <penitentpentwitch> Gravemind, you used to be cool. Then you stopped rhyming.
[4:18:54] <+DrTomT18> hoe status mad
[4:18:55] <%Josef_Stryker> Gravemind? More like Gravemad Kappa woolieMIRIN
[4:18:56] <%phatmac16> HOW CAN THIS BE!?!
[4:18:58] <garbageheaphound> yes
[4:18:58] <Raztron> Nyarlythotep can get mad
[4:18:58] <%Bonerlord911> i have beaten fleets of THOUSANDS! consumed a galaxy of FLESH and MIND and BONE!
[4:18:59] <xxshadowxx416> yes
[4:18:59] <$whiskeybuisness> the cole protocol: cole train runs on whole grain! WHOOOO!
[4:18:59] <%Bigyanno> Can an ant make a human mad?
[4:18:59] <Torivore> Turret chan's gone off to a farm where it can play with all its turret friends in big wide fields
[4:19:00] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> lovecraft's monsters got mad
[4:19:01] <KingVantq> I died to rocket flood so many times on this level
[4:19:01] <%krispen_wa> Eldritch Horror at how incompetent he is
[4:19:02] <dinnydanny777> Gravemind has the anger of millions of beings
[4:19:04] <DeepSearch27> Eldritch bitch?
[4:19:05] <%Slimshazbot> @subjectg I did it with randoms,. and let me say. I wish to god I didn't. I don't blame you :V
[4:19:06] <Incrodon> Elder gods can in fact be mad
[4:19:07] <%DensityD> grave mad X24
[4:19:07] <%superc37> GRAVEHOES MAD
[4:19:08] <%subjectg> @nomad94 unfortunately for you, i have principles
[4:19:09] <%phatmac16> I DONATED TO YOUR ONLYFANS CORTANA
[4:19:09] <+portlandsunshine> Gravemind is just posting through it
[4:19:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Gravemind has ALL the feelings
[4:19:12] <letshavecakes> gravemind is really poorly written in the back half of these missions tbh
[4:19:12] <MoshPitMoira> Elbitch Being
[4:19:12] <%raven_frame> Why'd Gravemind crash High Charity on the Ark? That sure seemed like a dumb move.
[4:19:13] <+eiightbiitt> is V still calling the spiker the Mauler?
[4:19:13] <%RunningNGunning> Cthuthu Caught Simpin
[4:19:16] <+mans51> considering how many people he ate he probably caught a few of their feelings
[4:19:17] <lotharrio> Cthulhu was mostly just angry he got woken up from his millenia long nap.
[4:19:17] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> Woolz you had a blade when you were using the brute shot
[4:19:18] <dinnydanny777> Gravemind is literally a Borg, he has the fury of millions
[4:19:19] <undercoverbarber> NotLikeThis
[4:19:22] <maskedmustelid> More oldritch than eldritch
[4:19:25] <+Blarghnox> @densityd just get the infinite spartan laser from Johnson. ez fight
[4:19:25] <Raztron> most old gods is them being annoyed waking up from their nap
[4:19:26] <%Josef_Stryker> Woolie there's just 9 shots in that thing
[4:19:29] <%CraftofPaper> What if I made one fall in love with me?
[4:19:29] <%Bonerlord911> lets turn on the giant microwave
[4:19:29] <+Ropcord> Avery Junior Cole Protocol Johnson
[4:19:30] <%phatmac16> I have a bad feeling about this...
[4:19:30] <%Dean_Inbetween> God has confirmed to have gotten mad in the bible so yes YOU CAN
[4:19:31] <Jmann1892> A Human and an Elite are shitting on him after he drove the Forerunners to suicide... no wonder he's salt
[4:19:32] <KingVantq> how many shots were in that shotgun chat?
[4:19:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> He is catching feelings bigger than you could possibly imagine with your smol brain
[4:19:33] <%huskarl_zap> eternity of idiot god edging
[4:19:36] <%jorniev> THE ONE FROM LEGACY of KAIN
[4:19:37] <DeepSearch27> Deep breaths
[4:19:37] <+ntfth> Hope he does the glitch.
[4:19:37] <%MajoraZ> @raven_frame because Halo 3 was poorly written and Joe staten wasn';t involved with it much unlike in 2
[4:19:41] <Onatamana> Gravemind may have nearly eaten the whole galaxy once, but he's never faced off against a PROTAGONIST.
[4:19:41] <%RioGascar> Eldbitch more like it
[4:19:42] <%subjectg> @slimshazbot living on the other side of the globe from america also complicates things

[4:19:56] <%RyTYoung> So I lied and said the last level was the best, I was meaning in fact this level
[4:19:56] <+kawachipto> I remember it was on the right
[4:19:58] <%raven_frame> Well you slapped hard with that friend.
[4:19:59] <%sssoapy> Creep and butthol doors
[4:20:00] <%Slimshazbot> @subjectg Yeah, I can see that being an issue :c
[4:20:03] <%DSD24> Is that the best you can come up with?
[4:20:03] <%DensityD> you lose hard, gravemind
[4:20:04] <%phatmac16> You were cooler in Halo 2
[4:20:04] <%Goraka91> Who is the real villain? :)
[4:20:05] <Talinu> He's an animal eating prey.
[4:20:05] <%brave_sj> Pat would give himself up to the Flood though
[4:20:06] <%huskarl_zap> I'm a victim
[4:20:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Its just THE THIRD IMPACT

[4:26:48] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Would firing this one even if its complete still wipe life though? Is it implied we fired it BECAUSE it was unfinished or because it's so far away from all sentient life?

[4:34:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer1000 Halo 3 is a great game, but as you can tell, it had a lot of writing issues and hiccups. Truth has an entirely different personality, Gravemind isn‚Äôt written as the hyper intelligence he was intended to be. One writer confirmed that Bungie changed their minds a lot during development. The prime example being the terminals and viral marketing saying that humanity and Forerunners are a different species (L calls Eden humans THEM), despite GS saying John is a Forerunner. Still a good game

[4:44:09] <saddlezilla1> @WoolieVersus As someone who doesn't really hate Halo 4 & 5, I still feel like 3's ending is still really strong if they chose to end it there. It's somber, but fitting for the universe.

[4:47:10] <therealtacopancakes> Reach or ODST next?
[4:47:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @smikeye dont Jackals more or less get along with humans now since it was always just business to them?
[4:47:10] <%phatmac16> REMEMBER REACH
[4:47:11] <dinnydanny777> Remember Reach
[4:47:11] <+Walopoh> Overrated Craig
[4:47:13] <+dordyott> his name is HALO MONKE, not craig
[4:47:13] <+Posh_Cat> ODST or reach?
[4:47:14] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @superc37
[4:47:14] <voodoolawyer> ODST is a cool game too. Don't think it has CO-OP though.
[4:47:15] <%brachydios777> Reach is more likely next
[4:47:16] <%doomerskeletor13> CRAIG I LOVE YOU
[4:47:16] <TrigglyPuf> GLASS THIS
[4:47:19] <TheAspiringWriter> @woolieversus Too bad anything interesting you could do with the Covenant is ruined by the terrible writing of 4 and 5
[4:47:20] <KillMyPast> So Reach then ODST?
[4:47:21] <+mans51> AngelThump themesong
[4:47:21] <saddlezilla1> Arbiter gives an apology to humanity and helps the Grunts rebuild. Proceeds to then genocide the Brutes LUL
[4:47:22] <+Invaderjaymz> Remember BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[4:47:24] <dinnydanny777> Reach is so fucking good
[4:47:26] <%jorniev> I LIKE CRAIG and his BOSS
[4:47:28] <TrigglyPuf> ODST has co-op
[4:47:31] <+smikeye> @LiquidDinosaur well, they get along with smugglers and pirates and mercenaries jsut fine, at least
[4:47:32] <xxshadowxx416> reach next olny one on mcc
[4:47:33] <Saffry_Ruzin> @liquiddinosaur To an extent actually
[4:47:34] <Xiangchang> ODST on PC is currently in it's first testing flight, so I'd expect ODST to be on PC MCC in September.
[4:47:34] <dinnydanny777> Reach is honestly my favourite one
[4:47:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> ODST or Reach next? :D
[4:47:38] <%huskarl_zap> all the spaghetti
[4:47:38] <%Goraka91> @saddlezilla1 Brutes had it coming
[4:47:39] <Raztron> Arbiter is literraly worse than Hitler now
[4:47:41] <flexxarnnn> sushima
[4:47:42] <ralphfromdk> saddlezilla1 As it should be
[4:47:43] <+IntrepidEye> All everyone talks about is Craig. No one remember the Brute pimp rooCry
[4:47:43] <+Alicitzen> Reach is my favourite for sure
[4:47:45] <%DSD24> God Tsushima was so good
[4:47:46] <%phatmac16> Is Reach on PC?
[4:47:48] <dinnydanny777> Reach is my absolute favourite
[4:47:49] <+QueequegTheater> @TheAspiringWriter How many goddamn times does V have to directly tell chat to shut up for you people to fucking get it
[4:47:52] <+laserchainsaws> The only game not to have local coop is 5 which given how they‚Äôre playing doesn‚Äôt really matter
[4:47:52] <%sssoapy> Until cyberpunk
[4:47:52] <$mnzion> Cheer500 I haven't read the books, so I might be wrong, but Cortana might have been one of the few things to ever escape Gravemind control, no wonder he was so salty.
[4:47:53] <+smikeye> @LiquidDinosaur but yeah, jackals are pretty much back to their large clan fleets and pirating
[4:47:56] <%jorniev> oh oh CYBERPUNK
[4:47:56] <%DSD24> Reach is on PC
[4:47:57] <penitentpentwitch> Need something linear... like Dead Space?
[4:47:58] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Halo Gaiden: Reach or ODST
[4:48:08] <voodoolawyer> Halo: Infinite is an open world game :s
[4:48:10] <+laserchainsaws> The only games that aren‚Äôt on pc yet are ODST and 4
[4:48:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> @smikeye well im sure the Innies pirate too
[4:48:15] <%Gruhunchously> Shushima
[4:48:17] <TrigglyPuf> Hope they do ODST and Reach next BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[4:48:17] <dryink_studios> get ready for infinite then
[4:48:19] <lokhaxz1> So did they just retcon the war, and there were actually way more colonies and the Covenant didn't get even close to wiping out humanity?
[4:48:23] <+moondog_> reach was the first on PC from mcc
[4:48:23] <Minerslovegames> Reach?
[4:48:30] <%superc37> if they wait like a few more weeks yall could totes do odst next
[4:48:32] <+smikeye> just do ODST and Reach on the console w/ couch co-op
[4:48:33] <DPmusique> NANO MACHINES ARMOR UPGRADE
[4:48:35] <%subjectg> throw out all that variety when doing LASO tho
[4:48:36] <ZeroCruz> ODST is coming pretty soon tho
[4:48:36] <%sssoapy> Spider-man does that way better
[4:48:37] <dinnydanny777> Gravemind : Tell me your secrets Cortana : Nuh uh
[4:48:39] <+Tucker1149> @woolieversus Really enjoying the series and if you do continue as the remaining games get added to MCC, like Metal Gear, going in release order is better. ODST-> Halo Legends -> Reach.
[4:48:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lokhaxz1 there were always more but reach was like, the last colony that "Mattered"
[4:48:47] <%ChoculaUltra> you HAVE to use this stance against this one enemy or we're going to pause the game till you switch
[4:48:47] <Sp3ctre48> Nah Humanity got pushed close to extinction for sure
[4:48:51] <Sullry> half of humanity was killed btw
[4:48:53] <voodoolawyer> >playing Halo Legends
[4:48:54] <%jorniev> yeaaah
[4:48:57] <+smikeye> IIRC Reach was an ONI research colony?
[4:48:58] <undercoverbarber> @WoolieVersus Did you guy get the scarab gun in Halo 2?
[4:48:58] <ralphfromdk> Tsushima has, Sword, bow and stealth. It's good, but that's it.
[4:48:59] <+SilverDevilfish> Rockstar Open World. It's Open... but also closed until you do the main missions.
[4:49:03] <%DukeAtomic> Is Halo Legends in the MCC???
[4:49:06] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Woolie NEEDS to see legends lol
[4:49:07] <%doomerskeletor13> @lokhaxz1 No? That was never the case, they just wrecked most of the outer colonies and some of the inner, them reaching Earth was a mistake
[4:49:10] <%phatmac16> it has a good flow
[4:49:11] <+QueequegTheater> @undercoverbarber it's a skull now
[4:49:11] <+IntrepidEye> With Tsushima its more you can go all in on stealth and gadgets or walking up and duel everyone
[4:49:11] <saddlezilla1> Reach imo has the best Campaign pacing
[4:49:13] <+moondog_> @smikeye yes and a mining planet
[4:49:15] <TheRealGreaterGamer> The DUEL IS GOING TO BLOW HIS MIND
[4:49:16] <+Lord_Kryos> I LASO'd Halo Legends
[4:49:17] <slatersev> Reach was wayyyyy more then a colony
[4:49:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lokhaxz1 like humanity could lose Earth and Reach survive and human society would remain.. If any non-reach, non-earth places were isolated they'd probably eventually lose spaceflight and be trapped
[4:49:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:49:26] <%brachydios777> @dukeatomic You can look it up on YouTube
[4:49:26] <%derap41> Its Arma Time baby
[4:49:30] <StebTheVee> Titanfall 2
[4:49:31] <lokhaxz1> 4 didn't really make it seem like humanity got fucked that hard
[4:49:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> There is a decent difference between going straight combat vs assassinations.
[4:49:33] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> whats the fighting game equivalent of learning to reload
[4:49:34] <Sullry> 23 billion human deaths
[4:49:35] <%doomerskeletor13> And Half Life too
[4:49:38] <undercoverbarber> @QueequegTheater Damn, that sucks
[4:49:40] <Onatamana> aim and move better
[4:49:40] <dinnydanny777> Infamous was better at doing that
[4:49:41] <+pedrothecruel> ARMA 3
[4:49:41] <+Freeborg1997> Tartarus, the prophets have betrayed us.
[4:49:44] <@Menitta> Finally. Crysis LP Kappa
[4:49:45] <+mans51> ahhh an age before microtransactions and rpg elements in every game
[4:49:47] <%jorniev> HALO is pretty Unique,, ONLY STARHAWK got close to it in terms of vareity
[4:49:48] <+smikeye> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug when to jump?
[4:49:48] <Raztron> @Neoepochx footsies
[4:49:50] <Jaku2011> That's in any multiplayer game
[4:49:53] <dinnydanny777> Infamous probably did that better before Tsushima
[4:49:53] <%derap41> @Sullry And we thank the man who did it
[4:49:55] <Raztron> or jabs
[4:49:57] <+ktothec99> Good FPS games are about adapting on teh fly
[4:49:59] <%hamahiroyuki> it all comes back to git gud
[4:49:59] <%huskarl_zap> remember new lore chat. sphinters evil because woolie can't close
[4:50:00] <%Gruhunchously> Non-artificial progress is great
[4:50:00] <%emeraldskrull> naw fuck learning
[4:50:01] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @smikeye strong answer
[4:50:02] <+moondog_> DAYZ standalone time lol
[4:50:04] <TheAspiringWriter> 4 Ruined any and all potential with the Covenant after the events of 3
[4:50:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug Learning that your meter exists and that supers are not based on RNG.
[4:50:15] <AMUSERNAME> Mostly improving situational awareness and decision making, more than specific reflexes.
[4:50:17] <%krispen_wa> Woolie Versus Call of Duty soon?
[4:50:18] <Artoo_The_Me> Thanks Woolie and V for the Halo 1-3 play through :)
[4:50:24] <Nomad94> @TheAspiringWriter oh please
[4:50:25] <%jorniev> LUL remember STARHAWK? GUYS?
[4:50:25] <%The_Swedish_X> "I never used this gun up to now, but now it is all I have. Gotta get good at it."
[4:50:29] <+QueequegTheater> @TheAspiringWriter SHUT UP ABOUT FUTURE GAMES
[4:50:31] <dinnydanny777> Remember Reach
[4:50:32] <+QueequegTheater> SHUT UP
[4:50:33] <+Walopoh> Any plans to play Reach before ODST comes out?
[4:50:34] <%krispen_wa> Woolie Versus Mountain Dew and Doritos soon?
[4:50:46] <%subjectg> gamesense and knowledge is extremely important in comparison to reflexes in Halo‚Äôs sandbox
[4:50:51] <%nxflre> and Infinite is open world so it will be weird
[4:50:51] <%phatmac16> Starhawks was good
[4:50:56] <%Irridium> I mean 343 said ODST should be out by the end of this month so a short break wouldn't be the worst
[4:50:56] <$andyfutrell> when people complain about the story in 4 and 5 I find stupid because I the halo series has always been very generic to me if halo was movie series instead of video game series they would be only slightly above
[4:50:58] <+laserchainsaws> Woolie owns MCC for console only issue is reach and ODST are dlc for the Xbox one version
[4:50:59] <%emeraldskrull> Is starhawk the one with the cool protag
[4:51:02] <saddlezilla1> also guys, plz let Woolie take a break from the series if he wants.
[4:51:06] <+mans51> OOOOOOOOOoooooOooo
[4:51:09] <lokhaxz1> @lewdskeletor13 @LiquidDinosaur I don't see what happened with humans from 4 onwards in the timeline, and think "Wow, humanity really got hard fucked."
[4:51:12] <+TheChapyGuy> Reach not counted, could you share some other FPS games you'd want to play? Black Mesa and Half-Life 2 seems like a good next step
[4:51:16] <voodoolawyer> if Halo was a movie it'd have to be Reach, I think. you couldn't do anything of chief
[4:51:22] <+bronin2099> You guys got me back into the game. My son and I are going through it all on legendary! Thanks!
[4:51:29] <voodoolawyer> ^^ NICE
[4:51:30] <+laserchainsaws> @thechapyguy he played black Mesa bro
[4:51:33] <resloxxx> @TheChapyGuy He already did black mesa
[4:51:33] <%Slimshazbot> AGREEEEEEED
[4:51:34] <DPmusique> Yes, me too
[4:51:34] <Kotyc_> Better writing
[4:51:34] <%Gruhunchously> @TheChapyGuy He's actually done Black Mesa already
[4:51:34] <undercoverbarber> Plasma pistol was trash in my mind until I used it with a BR, turns out its god like
[4:51:35] <KingBeardg> JR:: URSJ
[4:51:36] <+TheChapyGuy> my bad
[4:51:37] <prince_johnny_> Ahhhh
[4:51:38] <+Vijuani> valid
[4:51:39] <saddlezilla1> Yup
[4:51:40] <KingBeardg> *HELL YEAH
[4:51:41] <+mans51> @voodoolawyer the book you mean?
[4:51:42] <eldragon_1> Agreed
[4:51:43] <+trainflip> same
[4:51:44] <%krispen_wa> Halo 2 is my favorite
[4:51:44] <DPmusique> I like the setpieces in 2 and the story
[4:51:45] <%DiscoMatador> Yep
[4:51:46] <%DensityD> YOU LOVE BLUR STUDIOS
[4:51:46] <%wunp_fxs> yep 2 is still best
[4:51:47] <+echobee_tv> Fair enough
[4:51:47] <%Pinkiefan> Same
[4:51:47] <prince_johnny_> Same
[4:51:47] <+laserchainsaws> Woah
[4:51:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> And thats why 3 needs a remake
[4:51:48] <+Invaderjaymz> @bronin2099 SICK!
[4:51:49] <%jorniev> Yeaaaaaah
[4:51:49] <Raztron> Boo
[4:51:49] <+FennecZephyr> Yeah, I agree
[4:51:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> yeah as a total package 2 is better
[4:51:52] <mujahideenfruityrebels> I knew you were cool Woolie PogChamp
[4:51:52] <TedLives> same
[4:51:53] <+QueequegTheater> @andyfutrell People aren't actually complaining about 4 though. It's the first game that actually addresses Master Chief as a person instead of just Shoot Guns Man. They're bitching about 343 taking the reins
[4:51:54] <+jisang0415> 2 has more arbiter
[4:51:55] <+laserchainsaws> 3 for me
[4:51:55] <%brachydios777> Yeah
[4:51:56] <TrigglyPuf> Yeah I think most people feel the same way
[4:51:58] <%Slimshazbot> 2 has a SIGNIFICANTLY better story
[4:51:58] <%phatmac16> 2 got me more hyped
[4:51:59] <Louie_Salmon> 2 is tight, totally
[4:52:00] <%subjectg> you know what? I don‚Äôt mind
[4:52:01] <%sssoapy> It's like LOTR two towers being better than return of the king
[4:52:01] <mcarora19> Same
[4:52:01] <Raztron> Give me Realtime transistion
[4:52:02] <+FennecZephyr> BLUR's cutscenes are too good, tbh
[4:52:03] <+Walopoh> Reach for me tbh
[4:52:04] <%RioGascar> Well...halo 3 is halo 2 2
[4:52:06] <%PR0MAN1> Reach will still always be my favorite
[4:52:06] <prince_johnny_> I switch from 2 to 3
[4:52:07] <%The_Swedish_X> 1 to 2 was a bigger jump than 2 to 3
[4:52:07] <Onatamana> I personally dislike 2 because you feel so god damn fragile on higher difficulties in that game.
[4:52:07] <%Halospaz117> Halo 3 is pretty much Act 3 of Halo 2
[4:52:07] <%doomerskeletor13> @lokhaxz1 I mean they lost a lot but they had hundreds of colonies to begin so even then losing a lot still leaves a lot
[4:52:08] <DPmusique> the campaign and multiplayers is great in 2
[4:52:08] <thebalticguy1> REMINDER ME 1 released AFTER
[4:52:09] <letshavecakes> 3 is like a solid marvel movie in comparison to 2
[4:52:10] <Raztron> This Is A Interactive Medium
[4:52:12] <%MajoraZ> I agree. 3 is sort of meh until the halfway point, and it's WAY less well wrtitten
[4:52:12] <+Lord_Kryos> 3 is a strong finish but 2 is a perfect middle
[4:52:13] <+ktothec99> 2 has great setpieces. The scarab stuff is so good
[4:52:16] <%Javaa01> They had a chance to make Halo 2 twice, even if that meant that the ending had to be cut
[4:52:16] <marvel877> Halo 3 was really just the 2nd half of Halo 2 because Bungie got REALLY ambitious but ran out of time.
[4:52:16] <+QueequegTheater> 2 is a story, 3 is a spectacle
[4:52:16] <AMUSERNAME> 2 Was a Space Opera, 3 was a Sci-Fi Military story.
[4:52:17] <StebTheVee> Aribiter didn't do much in 3
[4:52:18] <+AXL808> I love 2's story structure
[4:52:20] <+Freeborg1997> @sssoapy How?
[4:52:20] <+penjaza> Story is better in 2, gameplay is better in 3
[4:52:24] <KillMyPast> OK BUT ODST
[4:52:24] <%doomerskeletor13> 3 has a lot of story problems
[4:52:24] <%phatmac16> 2 expands the universe
[4:52:25] <%derap41> 2 is best
[4:52:27] <black_pariah> the plot doesnt start until the halfway point to be real
[4:52:27] <%vaderxyz1970> It feels like halo 3 took place in 2 days
[4:52:28] <kingofmonsters2552> 4 is awful. Stop defending it.
[4:52:29] <TrigglyPuf> Arby I feel was shafted in this game. He feels a whole lot less apart of the story
[4:52:29] <eldragon_1> I always liked the Arbiter leves on2
[4:52:30] <%MaddyCaddy> :(
[4:52:30] <%brachydios777> LUL
[4:52:31] <%Gruhunchously> REEEEEEEEEE
[4:52:31] <prince_johnny_> LUL
[4:52:31] <%RunningNGunning> Looking at the Campaign only, yeah 2 is prob my fav
[4:52:32] <%DSD24> Ahhhh
[4:52:32] <%wunp_fxs> ya those weiirdos
[4:52:32] <+Vijuani> pieMafia
[4:52:32] <+laserchainsaws> 2s levels are a bit too linear for me
[4:52:32] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> REACH IS REALLY GOOD THO
[4:52:33] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus 2 was a great story, 3 was a spectacle
[4:52:34] <+Alicitzen> REEEE
[4:52:34] <OverlordLuna> LUL
[4:52:35] <+edited156> HOW DARE YOU V
[4:52:36] <+Walopoh> :) Reach my favorite
[4:52:36] <DatAsuna> ODST tho
[4:52:36] <Louie_Salmon> Jebaited
[4:52:36] <BlackermanZX> REEEEE
[4:52:37] <MrLayZboy> it's not bait if it's true
[4:52:37] <TEEron11> ODST is the best halo, fight me in the streets
[4:52:37] <RayMan799> ODST THO
[4:52:37] <+LegacyOfTheSith> atpNinja atpNinja
[4:52:37] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[4:52:37] <+Invaderjaymz> 2 was top tier, 3 as far as a conclusion was great
[4:52:38] <+MeMillionthDollar> LUL
[4:52:38] <APegForReggie> ODST best
[4:52:38] <TheRealGreaterGamer> V, YOU MOTHER
[4:52:40] <+Reaverund> Reach is stinky poopoo
[4:52:40] <%PR0MAN1> Its ok to have bad taste V
[4:52:40] <%timjpink> Cheer1000 For finishing the fight
[4:52:40] <+eiightbiitt> Reach is awesome
[4:52:41] <%phatmac16> HOW DARE YOU
[4:52:41] <anarchistPastry> Reach when
[4:52:42] <%derap41> I mean Reach is good but its not better
[4:52:42] <%DiscoMatador> ODST THO
[4:52:42] <%Irridium> nah the real ones' favorite is Spartan Assault
[4:52:43] <+pedrothecruel> GET HIM
[4:52:43] <voodoolawyer> Halo 3's soundtrack is better though. EXCEPT FOR THE GUITAR
[4:52:43] <+mans51> characters in halo 4 were laughably bad so even if they had the right direction it doesn't matter
[4:52:44] <Cervarian> psaCanada xxxPLICIT psaWrong
[4:52:44] <marvel877> Reach is alright.
[4:52:44] <$emptyantics> ODST
[4:52:44] <+Ropcord> 4 is great you fuckin babies
[4:52:45] <saddlezilla1> 2 also has better character growth with Arby, Chief doesn't devolp as much in 3
[4:52:45] <%brave_sj> ODST THO
[4:52:45] <RetributionP> ODST THO
[4:52:46] <+StabbityStyle> ODST is best and it's not close
[4:52:46] <%Topio1> OH V IM SOOOO RUSTLED
[4:52:47] <AppleBerryKitty> what is reach Kappa
[4:52:47] <%Bonerlord911> reach is good but its a step down
[4:52:48] <+Vijuani> ODST THO
[4:52:48] <%subjectg> Reach is cool man
[4:52:48] <+kawachipto> Story wise, 2, Reach, 3/Odst, Halo
[4:52:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @AMUSERNAME i think the problem is that 2 gives us so much Covenant story which IMO is more interesting thant some military assholes
[4:52:50] <%Pinkiefan> Only reason I liked 3 so much is I did 4 player campaign co-op. 2 was a much better overall experience. ODST is my favorite.
[4:52:54] <+novacrusader727> Hey now
[4:52:54] <%The_Swedish_X> I still don't know how I feel about Reach
[4:52:54] <%phatmac16> ODST THO
[4:52:55] <%superc37> @kingofmonsters2552 yknow theres no need to salty that people like a game youve never played
[4:52:55] <%MajoraZ> 2 > ODST > Reach > 3 > CE > 4 > 5 ( 5's got great MP tho)
[4:52:55] <+laserchainsaws> Odst is my fave actually
[4:52:56] <zocano> 2 is presentation wise the strongest by a mile
[4:52:58] <%krispen_wa> Halo 3 really falls apart on closer inspection
[4:52:59] <%MacabreOpus> Why is ODST considered the best to some?
[4:53:00] <otterlyhyped> The 3 story was basically supposed to be in 2
[4:53:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> I like 1 the most
[4:53:00] <%Foopoof> Nice b8 m80
[4:53:02] <%krispen_wa> the story at least
[4:53:03] <FiendishlyInventive> 3 does require an Anniversary Edition in the next two or three years, anyone who says otherwise's in denial IMO. <3
[4:53:04] <+Walopoh> ODST doesn't exist chat shhhhh Kappa
[4:53:05] <+QueequegTheater> REMEMBER REACH
[4:53:06] <%Bonerlord911> 2 had so much content cut from it though
[4:53:08] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Pretending to be retarded still makes you look retarded
[4:53:09] <dinnydanny777> Remember Reach
[4:53:09] <rytisone> Halo 2 had a lot of world building
[4:53:10] <+Creggamonsta> we did it

[4:53:12] <Onatamana> Halo 2's story was the best tho

[4:53:13] <%Gruhunchously> Star another Fight
[4:53:14] <%phatmac16> NO MORE HALO
[4:53:14] <%BisoromiBear> combat completed
[4:53:14] <+IntrepidEye> 2's story was fantastic. 3 was kind of a let down there especially with Johnson jobbing, Miranda throwing herself to her death and Arbiter not really doing anything
[4:53:14] <Joestar1890> FIGHT DONE
[4:53:15] <prime_name> FTF
[4:53:15] <+eiightbiitt> ODST is boring

[4:56:24] <%brachydios777> Some of you got bad timing for streaming times
[4:56:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:56:29] <+zombinedotrar> H2 was supposed to end with them finding the Ark, & H3 was to be an entire game on the Ark. H2's dev went so bad they restarted and cut the final act of the game, which is why 3 feels like the 3rd act of a story but not its own like CE & 2.
[4:56:32] <+Walopoh> 5 hours and 18 minutes in. "y'all start yet?" LUL
[4:56:45] <lexcorphr> Is this where you start playing Dead or Alive 4, to really finish the fight?

[4:57:26] <DatAsuna> 3 is a very simple story
[4:57:30] <%brachydios777> @zombinedotrar Probably for the best in my opinion because 2 would of probably been too long
[4:57:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> HALO WARS
[4:57:31] <%Bonerlord911> halo 2 was too ambitious and it almost didnt happen because of that. 3 they were trying to play it more safe
[4:57:35] <KillMyPast> Desperation?
[4:57:36] <lokhaxz1> The story needed character death
[4:57:36] <%Slimshazbot> 3 has COUNTLESS don't think about it moments

[4:57:37] <%BisoromiBear> I'M HELPING

[4:58:04] <$andyfutrell> Cheer100Cheer100Cheer100Cheer100Cheer100when people complain about the story in 4 and 5 I find it stupid because I think the halo series has always been very generic when it comes to story if the halo series gameplay wasn't as good as it is I would rank it way lower what makes halo so good to me is the gameplay
[4:58:07] <%Chatterbox1991> please stop shitting on mira

[4:58:24] <%krispen_wa> Why didn't Miranda simply eat Truth
[4:58:31] <DatAsuna> It's a very basic action plot
[4:58:32] <Onatamana> Maybe if there was a bit where Miranda tried to shoot out the window and failed, and then just went "fuck it" and crashed through it, it would've made more sense. Like she suddenly had to do SOMETHING.
[4:58:34] <%DensityD> too bad arby and the chief has aged so poorly
[4:58:40] <DeepSearch27> Why didn't Miranda just fuck Truth?
[4:58:43] <%Slimshazbot> There WAS more to it, then the writers changed
[4:58:46] <%derap41> 3 Narrative is definitely weaker
[4:58:47] <TEEron11> never stop pushing halo wars
[4:58:48] <+AXL808> I felt Truth was much more subtle in 2 than 3
[4:58:51] <FiendishlyInventive> THERE WAS originally.
[4:58:53] <%RioGascar> halo 3 is literally just halo 2 2
[4:58:54] <TrigglyPuf> Yeah agreed
[4:58:55] <$andyfutrell> @queequegtheater it want let me use my bits
[4:59:03] <+QueequegTheater> Use spaces
[4:59:03] <%RioGascar> cause they ran out of time
[4:59:05] <+Freeborg1997> He whispers to Johnson, "that secret dies with all the rest".
[4:59:05] <%Gruhunchously> His new voice actor is weaker too
[4:59:07] <dinnydanny777> Halo 3 feels like a rushed resolution to the end of Halo 2
[4:59:07] <%krispen_wa> Why didn't Gravemind kill Arby and Chief with his tentacles after Truth died?
[4:59:08] <$Kirby_Sauce> sometimes poeple like to see more than there is. that's headcannon
[4:59:13] <Raztron> Hes Aware he'll survive on the Ark
[4:59:13] <%derap41> No Dual Needler :(
[4:59:18] <%superc37> @riogascar so what youre saying is that halo 3 is a sequel to 2
[4:59:23] <FiendishlyInventive> Truth had a plan in Joe Staten's story.
[4:59:25] <+Bricespresso> yeah same
[4:59:26] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> He‚Äôs voices by General Zodd in 3
[4:59:26] <%krispen_wa> WOOLIE CONFIRMED AI HATER
[4:59:26] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie hates AI and robots Kappa
[4:59:29] <dinnydanny777> Halo 3 feels like a rushed ending to 2
[4:59:31] <+IntrepidEye> 3 had a shitton of development issues. They were literally changing key plot points week to week in the last 6 months of it shipping
[4:59:31] <stachystat> But Cortana is Halo waifu doogTrash
[4:59:33] <Raztron> Oh Boy Woolie!
[4:59:40] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Honestly when it comes to religion at least, a lot of con men eventually believe their own lies
[4:59:40] <Raztron> LUL
[4:59:42] <%immortan_joel> laughs in halo 4
[4:59:42] <$Kirby_Sauce> roboist confirmed
[4:59:45] <%superc37> tbf woolz you have been playing these game sfor like a decade when 3 came out
[4:59:45] <+QueequegTheater> BUT BLUE TIDDY THO
[4:59:46] <%doomerskeletor13> @kirby_sauce It‚Äôs not head canon, Halo 3 had a lot of writing issues that they‚Äôve talked about
[4:59:47] <mujahideenfruityrebels> You‚Äôll love 4 LUL
[4:59:49] <saddlezilla1> yea looking back on the original 3 i gotta say they didn't do loads to endear u to Cortana
[4:59:49] <dinnydanny777> But she's hot
[4:59:50] <realestlingeray> Tbh, i don't think prophet of regret believed in the journey. When you saw him in the gravemind scene, he was just being 'puppeteered' by gravemind, or so i'm told.
[4:59:50] <%superc37> havent*
[4:59:50] <FiendishlyInventive> Woolie's gonna love 4.
[4:59:52] <%derap41> Cortana Ain't no Homer if you get me chat
[4:59:53] <+maenos2> but waifu tho
[4:59:54] <dinnydanny777> But Woolie, she's hot
[4:59:55] <%phatmac16> but blue titties tho
[4:59:56] <%Irridium> BUT BLUE TIDDY LADY
[4:59:59] <+Ropcord> 4 handles it a lot better tbh
[4:59:59] <dinnydanny777> But the butt
[4:59:59] <%Gruhunchously> @dinnydanny777 That's because it is, essentially. They had to cut a lot of story elements out of 2
[5:00:01] <TEEron11> the next logical step in this story is halo wars
[5:00:01] <%RunningNGunning> Bungie focused on other aspects of the game other than the story and IT SHOWS
[5:00:02] <+Bricespresso> reboot?????
[5:00:04] <%eyezehuhh> bloobs
[5:00:05] <JaseAdrift> welp woolie definitely ain't playing 4
[5:00:05] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Woolie is racist towards AI
[5:00:07] <%derap41> Read Bobiverse for good AI story Woolie
[5:00:09] <+Invaderjaymz> She's AI with attitude!
[5:00:09] <spiegspikel> You will LOVE halo 4, then.
[5:00:10] <%krispen_wa> WOOLIE CONFIRMED AI-RACIST
[5:00:11] <%subjectg> woolie hates artificial intelligence, confirmed
[5:00:12] <%Chatterbox1991> Woolie confirmed synthphobe
[5:00:15] <+laserchainsaws> Woolie chief is Jesus he locks himself away and everyone thinks he‚Äôs dead only to return and save the world
[5:00:16] <FiendishlyInventive> LOVE 4
[5:00:16] <+Lord_Kryos> Halo 2 Cortana Sass best Cortana
[5:00:19] <%ChoculaUltra> @WoolieVersus V, what're you eating
[5:00:21] <%krispen_wa> WOOLIE CONFIRMED AL-BHED HATER
[5:00:22] <Raztron> AI Are Not Programs!
[5:00:22] <%Gruhunchously> Someone's gonna love Halo 4 then
[5:00:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> She's like a mom comrade. A momrade if you will.
[5:00:24] <rytisone> Cortana sASS
[5:00:26] <Artoo_The_Me> WOOLIE HATES TRON
[5:00:26] <%seniormeatbox> Woolie will Love 4
[5:00:28] <%jorniev> I NEED TO SAVE MY PC
[5:00:30] <Raztron> They;re Alive!
[5:00:31] <%MajoraZ> V what type of chocolate is that?
[5:00:32] <%emeraldskrull> I would root for the reapers to win if I could save EDI
[5:00:33] <+netrac> FLESH SUPREMACIST
[5:00:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Cortana got fucked in this game, her arc is awful
[5:00:42] <+Posh_Cat> ‚ÄúBet you cant stick it‚Äù - Cortana LUL
[5:00:45] <TEEron11> The true sequel to 3 is Wars
[5:00:45] <black_pariah> the race war starts now
[5:00:48] <%Gruhunchously> Gravemind and Cortana sitcom when?
[5:00:52] <spiegspikel> Woolie hates Nier: Automata, confirmed.
[5:00:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> NO
[5:00:53] <%brachydios777> I love how people put the Bungie games on such a pedastil and just shit on 343 abd here we are talking about the problems of 3 LUL
[5:00:56] <%vaderxyz1970> @derap41 Bobbiverse isn't really good AI it's just people put into computers
[5:01:02] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Gravemind is a bad roommate
[5:01:04] <Raztron> @spiegspikel LUL
[5:01:04] <FiendishlyInventive> NO, the true sequel to 2's ODST.
[5:01:06] <%RioGascar> Well in story cortana was only rescued for the index IF say the player didnt care about cortana
[5:01:09] <+jiggy_snipe> I don't mind Truth drinking the koolaid
[5:01:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> WHY DID HE START A RACE WAR IF HE THOUGHT THE WORLD WOULD END IN A WEEK?
[5:01:12] <Raztron> Oh No Spoilers!
[5:01:12] <dinnydanny777> 4 is fine
[5:01:13] <+QueequegTheater> Well, 4 does
[5:01:14] <DatAsuna> 4 deconfirmed?
[5:01:15] <%Irridium> just wait there's PLENTY to talk about in 4 and especially 5
[5:01:15] <%Slimshazbot> 3 is way too safe and predictable. There's no big dramatic twists,. everything plays out how you expect, and it just ends.
[5:01:16] <%Pinkiefan> But don't you see, Chief didn't delete his browsing history! How would you feel if someone took your pc?
[5:01:20] <dinnydanny777> 4's Opening is very good
[5:01:22] <$Kirby_Sauce> 4
[5:01:27] <+QueequegTheater> That is accurate
[5:01:27] <%Slimshazbot> Reach touches on it too
[5:01:28] <dinnydanny777> 4 Has a very good opening
[5:01:31] <marvel877> 4's okay. 5....EEEHHHH
[5:01:31] <%doomerskeletor13> 4 mostly, 5 fucks it up
[5:01:32] <Raztron> It Is A Really Dumb Direction to Take Halo
[5:01:36] <%seniormeatbox> Reach and 4 both touch upon this
[5:01:39] <Raztron> Its More About the Aliens
[5:01:40] <%phatmac16> 5 shot my dog
[5:01:41] <%derap41> @vaderxyz1970 Which is the same as in Halo
[5:01:46] <newbroxes> Totally agree, Woolie, Halo 2's story has a much more interesting story, but I adore all of Halo 3's missions
[5:01:47] <TEEron11> Halo wars will answer all your questions woolie
[5:01:49] <%krispen_wa> She's not just his AI...she's his waifu
[5:01:51] <+QueequegTheater> Halo 5 killed my father
[5:01:52] <%RunningNGunning> Halo 5 fucked my girlfriend
[5:01:52] <DatAsuna> reach is a very light touch on it
[5:01:53] <%superc37> reach doesn't rly touch upon it tho
[5:01:55] <TEEron11> i guarantee it
[5:01:56] <+MeMillionthDollar> One of a kind <3
[5:01:58] <Raztron> Theres Multiple Woolie
[5:01:58] <dinnydanny777> 4's Opening cinematic is a massive loredump that might help you Woolie
[5:01:59] <%seniormeatbox> Reach, Wars and 4 will answer those questions
[5:02:00] <prime_name> Hmmmm
[5:02:01] <%Gruhunchously> 4 has a great beginning and a great ending (after the first not-so-great ending), the stuff in the middle is kind of eh.
[5:02:02] <voodoolawyer> no AI is nearly as thick as her
[5:02:06] <Futurecity10> halo 5 killed my dog
[5:02:06] <%phatmac16> Halo 5 killed my family
[5:02:09] <%nxflre> play reach THEN!
[5:02:12] <%krispen_wa> It's a 9S-2B situation
[5:02:12] <+AShinyVagikarp> lololololol
[5:02:13] <philzy240> V no!
[5:02:13] <Raztron> She's The Only One with Access to Halo
[5:02:13] <%DiscoMatador> Halo 5 killed mt grandpa!!
[5:02:14] <+IntrepidEye> She actually is one of a kind technically.
[5:02:15] <$Kirby_Sauce> whatchu lookin at V
[5:02:15] <voodoolawyer> WE SEE YOU, V
[5:02:17] <StarlitStunner> Kalmiya was pretty cool
[5:02:17] <TedLives> V stahp!
[5:02:19] <%jorniev> ITS LIKE BLADE WOLF
[5:02:19] <lotharrio> V intimidating woolieONEGUY_TK into silence.
[5:02:20] <%brachydios777> Halo 5 took the kids
[5:02:20] <%AlexandriasFolly> V Staring directly into the camera
[5:02:24] <dinnydanny777> But Woolie have you seen her hips tho
[5:02:25] <penitentpentwitch> The potential of a Cortana Sandwich
[5:02:27] <%Xisalex> cheer500 Hey, I have some bits, wanna reedeem myself a bit, and I wanna tell you about the AI shit. Lemme know if it's okay!
[5:02:27] <+Posh_Cat> You‚Äôll have to reach for it Kappa
[5:02:28] <+jeasybakeoven> Truth being a true believer zealot and being a scheming opportunist are not mutually exclusive at all, it kind of makes sense that he would fuck over anybody for power considering the goal of his religion is to become a god.
[5:02:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Staring match with V!
[5:02:33] <%MessyBristles> funny thing is none of that at the time was addressed in the games only the books which suuuucks
[5:02:34] <voodoolawyer> Cortana was deemed 'most fuckable AI'
[5:02:34] <Jmann1892> Cortana isn't just an AI she's Chief's Friend
[5:02:35] <black_pariah> V fucking staring down chat LuL
[5:02:36] <lokhaxz1> I wonder what could be so special about Cortana in relation to a Spartan
[5:02:36] <%DarkestVegemite> uh oh you've roused the book nerd's rage again
[5:02:37] <%krispen_wa> Cortana THICC. Would you let THICC die?
[5:02:40] <lokhaxz1> Kappa
[5:02:41] <%CraftofPaper> V don‚Äôt look at me
[5:02:42] <%YakumoYomi> I feel like V is staring right into my soul
[5:02:42] <+laserchainsaws> She is but why exactly is spoils
[5:02:44] <dinnydanny777> Two Cortana's would be too much for John to deal with
[5:02:45] <+AXL808> A.I. sentience is important in the books as there's an A.I. that sues the government to recognize it's right to live.
[5:02:46] <Torivore> No rhetorical questions though who cares if this information existed since 2001
[5:02:47] <+Ropcord> Halo 5 poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses
[5:02:48] <Artoo_The_Me> Thanks V for constantly reminding chat
[5:02:48] <%ChoculaUltra> V, can you bite closer to the mic. I-I need this rn.
[5:02:50] <%Slimshazbot> I mean if you had a clone of yourself, and one of you died, would it be reasonable to say "well there's two of him so whatever?"
[5:02:53] <%eyezehuhh> The Scoptophobia, V
[5:02:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Most humans aren‚Äôt one of a kind, does that make them less important
[5:02:58] <%Irridium> Halo 5 literally killed my family
[5:02:58] <fault_417> Can‚Äôt argue with the results
[5:03:00] <TEEron11> Next stream Halo Wars?
[5:03:01] <Sullry> Still fun as hell
[5:03:02] <dinnydanny777> Imagine John having to deal with two Cortana's simping for him 24/7
[5:03:09] <+jiggy_snipe> @lewdskeletor13 lol?
[5:03:09] <%RioGascar> Wasnt intended at all but you can do it
[5:03:10] <Raztron> Its Another Dark Spot For the UNSC
[5:03:10] <prince_johnny_> LUL
[5:03:16] <%AlexandriasFolly> Halo 5 gave my family COVID
[5:03:16] <Futurecity10> The terminals have backwards voices
[5:03:16] <dinnydanny777> Imagine how many missed calls John would have from two Cortana's
[5:03:19] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Next stream is Halo Megablocks
[5:03:21] <coreyyotto> rings a bell
[5:03:22] <Raztron> How They Treat the Ai's
[5:03:26] <%MajoraZ> @funkizeit except if it makes them gods, he has no reason to get rid of the other prophets and try to keep power to himself. There's other hints he knew what the rings did in Halo 2 as well: He says Guilty Spark told him about the Sacred Icon, when we know Spark has no issues telling covies the truth, for example)
[5:03:26] <Onatamana> Too bad Cortana is just a hologram
[5:03:26] <%Gruhunchously> ???
[5:03:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1290540030302334977?s=20
[5:03:29] <%DensityD> EXAMPLE
[5:03:32] <marvel877> I think that was stuff of Gravemind talking in reverse or something?
[5:03:32] <prince_johnny_> Every song played backwards has a message
[5:03:34] <RetributionP> why isn't halo wars in the MCC! what a rip-off
[5:03:35] <JaceDarkstar> V Can you tell woolz about the vid master achievements
[5:03:35] <TrigglyPuf> @alexandriasfolly LUL LUL LUL
[5:03:37] <voodoolawyer> If you play Hoes Mad backwards it makes you taller
[5:03:37] <%DensityD> 2nd example pls
[5:03:40] <%phatmac16> Halo 5 took my wife
[5:03:42] <TEEron11> They should just do a stream where they just read the books silently
[5:03:44] <spiegspikel> Isn‚Äôt it possible for Truth to be a true believer and an opportunist at the same time.
[5:03:45] <%RyTYoung> siiiick
[5:03:47] <+Lord_Kryos> Cortana is just John's virtual youtube avatar
[5:03:49] <%subjectg> Destroyer‚Äôs Invocation is a track with reverse voices that point to a future character
[5:03:57] <%krispen_wa> @Onatamana but if she can activate his suit's autoblow is she just a hologram?
[5:04:04] <voodoolawyer> what
[5:04:07] <%ChoculaUltra> that was an amazing Simpsons episode.
[5:04:11] <%YakumoYomi> Join the Navy

[5:04:39] <SomersaultJustice> that's right, I'm Lieutenant L.T. Smash
[5:04:40] <%DensityD> FOR 12 SECONDS
[5:04:41] <%CraftofPaper> Woah
[5:04:42] <Onatamana> @krispen_wa if only hard light technology existed in the Halo setting
[5:04:42] <%Holycow8498> I think i was the 17th person then to bring up Halo legends
[5:04:43] <%brachydios777> LUL
[5:04:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Doesnt the FLood OST from halo 2 have Menidict Bias creepy whispering?
[5:04:48] <DatAsuna> And it sucks
[5:04:49] <%Holycow8498> If only i was 117th to bring it up
[5:04:56] <%huskarl_zap> Anime is dumb god I hate that elite in the armor
[5:04:57] <%derap41> The Military Industrial Complex is still going strong
[5:04:57] <Raztron> Cheaper than a Spartan 2 is the logic lol
[5:04:57] <+Ropcord> and you get 5 shots LUL
[5:04:58] <dinnydanny777> The Spartan Laser is ridiculous because it implies that Earth would still have Helium hundreds of years in the future:)
[5:04:58] <%Javaa01> So it's a Stinger
[5:05:00] <+jeasybakeoven> @MajoraZ that's fair, but i still personally prefer him just being a dickbag zealot, it fits the theme better
[5:05:00] <+mans51> halo legends were awful imho
[5:05:08] <Djinnazz> lol
[5:05:09] <ralphfromdk> But it also deletes a Wraith in one shot... warthogs don't do that
[5:05:17] <TEEron11> halo legends is sick actually
[5:05:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HMMMMMM
[5:05:19] <DPmusique> well...
[5:05:20] <%brachydios777> A suit of Mjolnir armor is more expensive than a UNSC frigate
[5:05:21] <+Ropcord> Kappa
[5:05:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Iron-Blooded Unggoy? OOF
[5:05:24] <+ZoltanBMagnus> DOUBT
[5:05:25] <KillMyPast> I dont believe you Woolie
[5:05:27] <Louie_Salmon> Well how would you know for sure?
[5:05:28] <%RyTYoung> it stings like a bitch
[5:05:29] <%krispen_wa> Remember when Woolie KILLED THAT GUY?
[5:05:30] <dinnydanny777> "If I shoot him, he'll shoot me"
[5:05:32] <%eyezehuhh> woolieFABRICATION
[5:05:34] <%doomerskeletor13> X to doubt
[5:05:36] <voodoolawyer> You also don't have to reload in Paintball very frequently
[5:05:36] <TEEron11> the prototype and the babysitter are sick as hell
[5:05:39] <DPmusique> We just witnessed halo paintball
[5:05:41] <DatAsuna> and then threw raw meat at the body
[5:05:50] <%DensityD> Woolie will first person it out
[5:05:51] <$andyfutrell> Cheer500 when people complain about the story in 4 and 5 I find it stupid because i think the halo series story has always been very generic to me if halos gameplay wasn't as good as it is I would rank the games way lower
[5:05:53] <%huskarl_zap> green means go
[5:05:54] <Tuna_Can_0> WHO DO I SHOOT??
[5:05:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> woolie needs glasses
[5:05:56] <marvel877> "Shoot the guy till he's painted."
[5:05:57] <FreedomARX7> ''No full auto indors!''
[5:05:58] <%MacabreOpus> Doesn't help that the allegiances of your enemies change on a dime
[5:05:58] <%vaderxyz1970> and then dumped the body
[5:06:05] <FreedomARX7> its not full auto
[5:06:09] <FreedomARX7> its not?
[5:06:11] <+AXL808> Woolie kills teammates like Paige kills other women
[5:06:12] <%DensityD> LP TAX IN PAINBALL YEYEYEYEYE
[5:06:13] <FreedomARX7> this is
[5:06:15] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Don‚Äôt worry Woolie, the friendly AI are useless most of the time
[5:06:16] <%ChoculaUltra> had a colorblind guy in a paintball group once when I was younger. Laughed way more than I should have.
[5:06:19] <DatAsuna> It seems like you're overreacting to a joke lol
[5:06:22] <viciousgrim> would love to see woolie play a map of mongoose racing
[5:06:23] <Torivore> So Woolie blind, you say?
[5:06:26] <%huskarl_zap> nah
[5:06:28] <DigitalJoshie> woolie stream paint ball Kappa
[5:06:31] <maskedmustelid> You don't respawn in paintball either!
[5:06:32] <%RyTYoung> I've only ever paintballed on a windy as fuck day and it was horrible
[5:06:37] <TEEron11> anyways, back to pushing halo wars
[5:06:38] <%Slimshazbot> THE COLE PROTOCOL TALKS ABOUT THIS!
[5:06:40] <%huskarl_zap> thats dumb
[5:06:45] <Raztron> Elites justify it as a fair War
[5:06:45] <DatAsuna> the one what>
[5:06:46] <%subjectg> Man woolie would have a great time identifying friend or foe in arma
[5:06:47] <%brachydios777> That was a good short
[5:06:48] <%CraftofPaper> Boooooooooks
[5:06:49] <%derap41> There is no redeption from Glassing a fucking planet
[5:06:56] <%DensityD> oh shit the dissappointment on his face
[5:06:58] <$Kirby_Sauce> yes there is

[5:07:41] <%derap41> Like there are deeds that can't be made right
[5:07:41] <%doomerskeletor13> That‚Äôs not very final at all lmao
[5:07:42] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL LUL
[5:07:43] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @QueequegTheater
[5:07:43] <%subjectg> Not playing on Legendary, coward
[5:07:43] <black0193> Yeah bro Halo 2 is also final
[5:07:45] <%Bonerlord911> it's a bookend to halo 1
[5:07:45] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Kappa w h a t
[5:07:45] <%phatmac16> 343 bad
[5:07:48] <ralphfromdk> It's right up there with "i'll be back"

[5:07:53] <%condemned_15> "Wake me when you need mony."
[5:07:54] <%DianaTheAscian> its a dumb cliff hanger
[5:07:57] <%vaderxyz1970> "Kept you waiting huh"
[5:07:57] <+Lord_Kryos> "Let me sleep woman"
[5:07:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> if ANYTHING is final its Halo CE
[5:07:58] <%eyezehuhh> If you have to start out your message with "Don't want to spoil" probably don't send the message?
[5:07:58] <+Ropcord> BabyRage 343 killed halo
[5:07:59] <$Kirby_Sauce> pfft
[5:07:59] <%huskarl_zap> last halo in ten years
[5:08:00] <Tuna_Can_0> Fade to black, then skyrim

[5:08:03] <%phatmac16> wake me when you need money mircosoft
[5:08:03] <voodoolawyer> "The ending of Halo 2 just felt so final to me."
[5:08:03] <%ChoculaUltra> I've never seen Queequeg get shot by Moobot before monkaS
[5:08:05] <DPmusique> It didn't feel like halo 4 should have happened with that ending scene I'll tell you that
[5:08:07] <%Javaa01> "Wake me when you need to launch a new console"
[5:08:08] <Onatamana> It's open ended, which is the option that pleases the most people. People who hate everything after 3 can pretend Chief is still asleep.
[5:08:10] <DatAsuna> people over romanticize 3
[5:08:11] <%MacabreOpus> Wake me up inside
[5:08:13] <Raztron> @voodoolawyer LUL
[5:08:14] <%krispen_wa> Halo 3 should have ended with a Cortana sex scene
[5:08:17] <@Menitta> It definitely feels like Bungie was forced to leave it open even if they didnt intend to continue that story
[5:08:17] <wichothemisticalwizard> 343 killed Halo Simpsons style.
[5:08:19] <%RioGascar> they did say prior ‚Äúits finished‚Äù but that can be interpreted as THAT STUFF IS FINISHED
[5:08:20] <%brachydios777> People can‚Äôt say 343 picked 4 out of their ass when Bungie literally teases it
[5:08:21] <MrLayZboy> Chief kept putting cortana on snooze
[5:08:25] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Onatamana what if halo 4 and 5 were all dreams ü§î
[5:08:29] <+jiggy_snipe> yea its an open ended ending, you can stop and or continue
[5:08:30] <Tuna_Can_0> John Halo in Avengers PogChamp
[5:08:30] <%derap41> They're not gonna say they're finished with their Flag ship title
[5:08:31] <%doomerskeletor13> The legendary ending literally hints at the next game
[5:08:33] <SomersaultJustice> John Halo will return in Halopussy
[5:08:45] <Raztron> 1 Week!
[5:08:54] <%Goraka91> monkaS That fast huh
[5:08:58] <voodoolawyer> wasn't it like 31 days?
[5:09:00] <Raztron> Demonstration of The Flood Threat
[5:09:01] <DatAsuna> TBF I can think of one frozen hero ending that would be fine with no sequel and that's Alien
[5:09:04] <%Irridium> the flood work real quick
[5:09:04] <+IntrepidEye> Canonically it was about a month
[5:09:05] <%ChoculaUltra> I still don't know how to feel about lore thats locked to different difficulty levels. Especially when I don't have time for a new game+ kind of thing.
[5:09:12] <voodoolawyer> 31 days from end of H2 to Cortana in H3
[5:09:12] <%huskarl_zap> planetoid
[5:09:20] <+QueequegTheater> @moobot I lived bitch
[5:09:20] <voodoolawyer> right?
[5:09:24] <Raztron> Flood are Airbone and Spore Zombies
[5:09:31] <Onatamana> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Halo 4 and 5 are AUs. I'm personally waiting for the "Just Talk Works Every Time" AU. Lots of potential there.
[5:09:32] <%PR0MAN1> The Prophets race went EXTINCT when the flood took High Charity
[5:09:33] <%subjectg> There were billions of covie sentients on high charity, think about that
[5:09:33] <%RioGascar> High charity is planet size
[5:09:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> It has billions of slaves
[5:09:36] <%DensityD> I am a monument to all your sins
[5:09:37] <DeepSearch27> Looking at you, V
[5:09:41] <%brachydios777> That animation is not great
[5:09:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> @PR0MAN1 RIP all the horny prophets

[5:09:49] <%Slimshazbot> It is a GREAT video
[5:09:50] <+barrakuta371> Oh I love that Polygon video
[5:09:53] <Raztron> Its Great Woolie
[5:09:57] <+jisang0415> BDG is too good
[5:09:59] <+D00msDayDan> but if we all become the master chief of loneliness then will we still be lonely?
[5:10:06] <+CyanDeadEye> What?
[5:10:10] <%Gruhunchously> What?
[5:10:11] <stachystat> doogHuh
[5:10:13] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie don't watch it, it has massive Halo 4/5 spoilers, in case you ever play them.
[5:10:15] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Last time I got caught stealing a calendar I got 12 months.
[5:10:16] <%PR0MAN1> Technically these a few thousand left. But there were 20 MILLION before the Flood hit High Charity
[5:10:18] <TEEron11> we can all be lonely together!
[5:10:21] <%Williamld> That's big wrong
[5:10:21] <+ultimafullmetal> Yeah books are for nerds and videogames are big chad
[5:10:24] <+smacksfenton> Chat, did he like the game overall? Just got here.
[5:10:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> That first trilogy was gold
[5:10:26] <Raztron> Master Chiefs canon power is Luck
[5:10:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:10:26] <+Extrallent> thats super wrong
[5:10:28] <black_pariah> that was only for john, tho?
[5:10:29] <%ChoculaUltra> @Gogogolem LUL get out
[5:10:30] <%Halospaz117> That was literally just John
[5:10:30] <letshavecakes> John halo literally got two-face'd into being a child soldier
[5:10:33] <Onatamana> Brian David Gilbert is like Game Theory that doesn't pretend to take itself seriously, it seems.
[5:10:34] <Raztron> His Maximum Stat
[5:10:35] <+QueequegTheater> @smacksfenton Less than 2 but still a lot
[5:10:38] <dinnydanny777> John is Lucky Ted
[5:10:39] <+jiggy_snipe> @smacksfenton yes, he does like 2 more tho
[5:10:42] <%derap41> With a Hard Bracket
[5:10:43] <+Lord_Kryos> Basically John guessed a coin flip but I think the point was he called it by watching it fall?
[5:10:47] <%RioGascar> thats wrong also so max bait with lore
[5:10:48] <+D00msDayDan> but he hasn't played 5 yet
[5:10:49] <Onatamana> Friendly reminder that Mario is a war criminal.
[5:10:58] <%brachydios777> Basically John being abducted was literally a coin flip
[5:11:07] <+smacksfenton> Thanks guys! @jiggy_snipe @QueequegTheater
[5:11:09] <Raztron> Arbiter is worse than Hitler
[5:11:11] <+jiggy_snipe> he fell into a portal Kappa
[5:11:15] <voodoolawyer> "Where will we go now, Arbiter?" 'TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.'
[5:11:18] <rytisone> find Ms. Arbiter
[5:11:19] <%brachydios777> LUL
[5:11:23] <+CyanDeadEye> Pretty sure John was the only one that was even offered the coin
[5:11:26] <%Goraka91> It's allegedly a different Arbiter, but that's no fun
[5:11:27] <Raztron> also KI Arbiter is the Halo 5 version
[5:11:29] <+paladinstarbuster> then dead or alive
[5:11:30] <+IntrepidEye> Must have bee that same portal Nicole fell in

[5:11:39] <DeepSearch27> "V is wrong" lmao
[5:11:42] <+Morose_Melon> thats wrong. the coin flip was specifically an interaction between John and Halsey
[5:11:47] <+Lord_Kryos> Reading content you mean?
[5:11:48] <%Gruhunchously> V vs The Universe
[5:11:52] <%kyh9> foreshadowing
[5:11:53] <+D00msDayDan> the forerunner books came out 4 years after halo 3
[5:11:54] <%Bonerlord911> they are literal books
[5:11:54] <DeepSearch27> The coin flip was from that backstory movie
[5:11:55] <dinnydanny777> You like READING?
[5:11:57] <Tuna_Can_0> reading DansGame
[5:12:00] <spiegspikel> The coin flip was exclusive to John

[5:13:45] <%brachydios777> Damn

[5:14:01] <dinnydanny777> The gross level with the anuses

[5:14:34] <+CyanDeadEye> No TIME/MONEY
[5:14:34] <%Goraka91> NO TIME
[5:14:36] <dinnydanny777> Gravemind died off camera

[5:14:40] <%huskarl_zap> no money from monopoly microsoft
[5:14:41] <%Halospaz117> Chief vs Zombie Arby's sounded fucking sick
[5:14:41] <%nxflre> Scarabs?
[5:14:42] <Tuna_Can_0> bosses in halo LUL
[5:14:42] <Onatamana> THE ABYSS WATCHERS
[5:14:42] <dinnydanny777> Gravemind fucking died off camera
[5:14:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> the level Cortana IS a boss fight. th entire map IS The Gravemind
[5:14:45] <fault_417> 2‚Äôs boss fights apparently didn‚Äôt get good reception :/
[5:14:46] <+IntrepidEye> they couldn't decide the direction they wanted the game to go in
[5:14:46] <%Holycow8498> I guess the scarabs?
[5:14:46] <%Slimshazbot> 2's boss fights were widely hated, so I imagine they didn't want to go that route.
[5:14:48] <+Idziman> 2401
[5:14:48] <penitentpentwitch> Scarab fight 1, Scarab fight 2?
[5:14:49] <%Javaa01> Boss fights don't really work in Halo, unless you just do a beefed up regular enemy
[5:14:50] <puluxor> TWO SCARABS
[5:14:50] <lokhaxz1> Every Halo game has had development cut in half lol
[5:14:53] <DatAsuna> they realized they're bad at boss fights
[5:14:53] <+FennecZephyr> I'd argue the scarabs count as bosses
[5:14:57] <Raztron> Eldritch Horrors are Not BossFights
[5:14:59] <%RioGascar> cause LOTS OF STUFF THATS IN HALO 2 was SUPPOSED TO BE IN HALO 1
[5:15:01] <%Gruhunchously> @DeepSearch27 The Halo 2 we eventually got was developed in almost less than half that time.
[5:15:03] <dinnydanny777> Just fight him
[5:15:05] <FiendishlyInventive> CORTANA MECH VERSUS GRAVEMIND we were ROBBED.
[5:15:06] <+jiggy_snipe> it can be a boss that you can't win
[5:15:10] <dinnydanny777> Just have you fight him and lose
[5:15:10] <%krispen_wa> Shoot the Big Mouth thing though?
[5:15:16] <%Irridium> Most of the bosses were in the Arbiter levels, which were heavily criticized, so it makes sense they'd try to move away from it.
[5:15:21] <Onatamana> You can Dead Space the Gravemind and then fuck off before he fixes himself.
[5:15:22] <TEEron11> they did it in destiny and it was lame
[5:15:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> it would be like Destiny, where there's gods with their own pocket dimensions and you just shoot them with bullets
[5:15:23] <DatAsuna> main op 51
[5:15:24] <%Goraka91> Yeah last time you hear Gravemind he's all ''Yo i've consumed a galaxy, oh wait you've beaten me I gues''
[5:15:25] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Perfect Chaos Gravemind
[5:15:26] <%derap41> Just Ride a ship into his stomach

[5:24:25] <%dekkitout> Either way, whoever posted that clip from Korra with a Clerks scene dubbed over deserves a medal
[5:24:28] <%MajoraZ> Correct, a lot of colonies only have millions of people
[5:24:31] <%krispen_wa> imagine how many cute girls died
[5:24:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Out colonies had low population

[5:26:08] <dinnydanny777> Alpha Protocol could have been great
[5:26:10] <resloxxx> ALPHA PROTOCOL
[5:26:10] <@Menitta> LUL
[5:26:10] <%PR0MAN1> Good game though
[5:26:10] <%derap41> I like Alpha protocol
[5:26:10] <+jiggy_snipe> oh no it's the Protocol Wars
[5:26:12] <%Javaa01> The bestest Obsidian game
[5:26:12] <$Kirby_Sauce> So you're saying CRUNCH IS GOOD?
[5:26:13] <DatAsuna> I wanted to like alpha protocol but I couldn't
[5:26:13] <%dekkitout> A does come before C HahaThink
[5:26:14] <RetributionP> XD
[5:26:16] <StarlitStunner> Best Sega game
[5:26:18] <+ChrisAlgoo> it's a good game!
[5:26:19] <%Halospaz117> Alpha Protocol is pretty good
[5:26:23] <%PR0MAN1> Its the GOOD kind of jank
[5:26:24] <%Javaa01> That game is hilarious
[5:26:26] <dinnydanny777> Alpha Protocol could have been fucking amazing but it turned out to be fucking shit
[5:26:26] <Raztron> its the Best Written Obsidian game
[5:26:29] <+QueequegTheater> A lot of people are blind Obsidian fanboys, yes
[5:26:31] <zocano> Alpha Protocol is a wondeful game
[5:26:34] <christopherwpoindexter> EYY OBSIDIAN RPG again?!?
[5:26:36] <+ChrisAlgoo> it is def jank
[5:26:40] <+smikeye> Alpha Protocol is busted, but it's a fun story
[5:26:42] <RetributionP> I still own a copy of alpha protocol
[5:26:43] <Raztron> Its one of The Few RPGs thats not Fantasy or Sci-fi
[5:26:43] <StarlitStunner> Sis and Sie are best girls
[5:26:47] <resloxxx> its janky as fuck but man its fun
[5:26:48] <%jorniev> JANK spy mass effect
[5:26:50] <%RioGascar> Its because it does things that no rpg does
[5:26:53] <dinnydanny777> Alpha Protocol is a game that could have been incredible but wasn't
[5:26:58] <+smikeye> fun fact, having worked on them, I think about how much pieces of shit some medical equipment is
[5:27:01] <%Halospaz117> Oh yeah it's SUPER jank
[5:27:05] <%DiscoMatador> Jank spy obsidian is great
[5:27:07] <%krispen_wa> Hot Take: Alpha Protocol was a game
[5:27:09] <%derap41> oh the game is bustedbut with mods and fisxes its way better
[5:27:13] <%Javaa01> There's no fixed, perfectly functional version of Alpha Protocol
[5:27:20] <e1io> Obsidian are masters at making jank fun
[5:27:22] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @krispen_wa You can‚Äôt say that
[5:27:23] <%Javaa01> But that's part of the appeal
[5:27:29] <+jiggy_snipe> make sure there were no penises

[5:27:50] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Thats more or less what building a movie print could be

[5:28:59] <%krispen_wa> dumb
[5:29:01] <%krispen_wa> bad take
[5:29:02] <DatAsuna> 1's story is
[5:29:04] <%doomerskeletor13> Not sure about that
[5:29:04] <Saffry_Ruzin> @christopherwpoindexter No, but Zuka 'Zamamee is that Elite you kill in the Elevator before the Warthog run in CE
[5:29:12] <TEEron11> halo has a dumb amount of really cool lore
[5:29:13] <JaseAdrift> what a bad take
[5:29:17] <TEEron11> way more than it needed to
[5:29:19] <ZeroCruz> Shit take
[5:29:21] <%huskarl_zap> wtf is hard scifi?
[5:29:22] <%DianaTheAscian> its funny cause i could care less about the gameplay tbh
[5:29:23] <%Slimshazbot> I wouldn't say "hard" sci-fi, but good sci-fi
[5:29:23] <Futurecity10> We should kill him for that opinion
[5:29:24] <+smikeye> Halo games have weak stories until 4, books are where stuff gets expanded/explained
[5:29:25] <%Pinkiefan> Love Halo 2's story.
[5:29:26] <DatAsuna> Marathon is also a very solid 90s sci-fi story
[5:29:26] <TrigglyPuf> No opinions are wrong, except that one
[5:29:28] <%derap41> Its Space Opera not hard Scifi
[5:29:29] <black_pariah> he was posting that over and over earlier in chat to get cool points, what a child
[5:29:31] <%krispen_wa> He's hard for sci-fi
[5:29:36] <DatAsuna> a very different kind of sci-fi tho
[5:29:42] <%Irridium> ain't nobody delving into the lore of Inversion
[5:29:44] <%superc37> @saffry_ruzin WAIT THAT WAS ZUKA
[5:29:44] <%jorniev> I thought 3 aged bad, i was wrong it looked pretty fun
[5:29:45] <TedLives> thats a pat take lol
[5:29:48] <+GundamF91> Thats what someone who didnt even try to pay attention to the story says
[5:29:49] <%ChoculaUltra> how embarrassing lol
[5:29:54] <christopherwpoindexter> @saffry_ruzin OK, thanks, I knew about who the name was, so what is the source then LUL
[5:29:54] <DatAsuna> Marathon eventualy starts knocking on some AM/no mouth shit
[5:29:57] <%superc37> Fuck i forgot about that
[5:29:58] <%seniormeatbox> that was 100% a PAT TAKE
[5:30:06] <+AXL808> Don't forget the Writ of Celibacy
[5:30:09] <%Bigyanno> I hope you play Halo Wars
[5:30:10] <%huskarl_zap> what is soft sci fi?
[5:30:10] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> 3 looks better than infinte
[5:30:11] <e1io> Are they going to play Reach?
[5:30:12] <%Gruhunchously> Did Pat leave that message?
[5:30:13] <Raztron> Remember How Reach was Master Chief doing cool stuff
[5:30:13] <%Slimshazbot> @huskarl_zap Hard sci-fi is stuff that's much more grounded in the "sci" side of things, like Star Trek. I wouldn't call Halo hard sci-fi IMO, but it's still solid science fiction.
[5:30:14] <$emptyantics> Halo Reach has one of the GREATEST VIDEO GAME ENDINGS EVER
[5:30:18] <%derap41> Woolie general rule if the setting has FTL its not Hard Scifi
[5:30:19] <Torivore> Books is media
[5:30:22] <%RioGascar> it is more a take of what bungie thinks of the casual player of halo
[5:30:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Halo rocks. It‚Äôs such an interesting universe
[5:30:27] <+IntrepidEye> Only problem I have with Halo lore is far too much of it focuses on Spartans. They really need to branch out more
[5:30:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Bigyanno take a drink everyone he says ALL UNITS
[5:30:28] <Futurecity10> Tom clancy
[5:30:28] <@Menitta> That WAS my opinion of the games prior to replaying them
[5:30:28] <Saffry_Ruzin> I made that as a Joke, because of what a fuck up Zuka is
[5:30:29] <%seniormeatbox> There's 7
[5:30:30] <TEEron11> are there any cod books?
[5:30:30] <+D00msDayDan> i read every call of duty book and became the captain price of loneliness
[5:30:31] <slamview> that's just every tom clancy book
[5:30:32] <%Gruhunchously> The adventures of Wolfgang Hammersmith
[5:30:36] <lokhaxz1> Uh oh Breeding Camps
[5:30:39] <+TheotherKristian> Play Them All
[5:30:40] <DatAsuna> As someone who is fully read up on the clancy universe, fuc the clancyverse
[5:30:41] <%seniormeatbox> 7 cod books
[5:30:42] <%jorniev> LIKE 3
[5:30:45] <JetpackMcQuack> Yeah
[5:30:48] <Raztron> They Made the Same Mistake for Destiny
[5:30:50] <AThing_> there are cod books?
[5:30:50] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> it has mostly comics
[5:30:51] <%huskarl_zap> gears of war died a 3 full stop no arguments
[5:30:52] <%krispen_wa> didn'
[5:30:52] <%derap41> It didn't
[5:30:54] <+jiggy_snipe> speaking of COD, COD4 and MW2 had a fun story
[5:30:54] <@Menitta> Call of Duty starts at Black Ops Declassified
[5:30:54] <black_pariah> written by karen travis so quality is a coin flip
[5:31:02] <+GundamF91> "I never intended on paying attention to the story, so story bad" is what that Donation was lol
[5:31:02] <%huskarl_zap> Karen
[5:31:02] <%seniormeatbox> @huskarl_zap someone needs to play Gears 5
[5:31:02] <%Gruhunchously> But Halo has a Library, doesn't it?
[5:31:06] <%jorniev> WHAT ABOUT destiny guys
[5:31:08] <%krispen_wa> didn't the main agent hero man of the Clancyverse become the president?
[5:31:09] <%subjectg> @bigyanno cool pfp my dude
[5:31:12] <%ChoculaUltra> I feel like the pressure on Infinite is massive, lore wise. Like actual "this is our last shot to redeem the franchise after 5 got buttblasted by everyone for years" type of pressure.
[5:31:13] <dinnydanny777> I bet COD has books
[5:31:14] <+IntrepidEye> It didn't. We really didn't need to know about their rape camps
[5:31:16] <%derap41> About all those Tom Clancy books
[5:31:17] <JetpackMcQuack> I read some Mass Effect as well
[5:31:17] <JaseAdrift> we dint talk about destiny
[5:31:20] <DatAsuna> Pendulum wars is a cool name for a war and that's all I know
[5:31:24] <+TheotherKristian> Gears devs purposefully has no world map so writers can do whatever they want
[5:31:26] <lokhaxz1> Destiny 2 has a codex kinda thiing at least
[5:31:31] <%huskarl_zap> @jorniev bro i cant penetrate the menus
[5:31:34] <Saffry_Ruzin> Zuka 'Zamamee, the Elite that fails so hard that Chief didn't even know he was being hunted by him

[5:32:56] <%jorniev> DAM
[5:32:57] <Sullry> Destiny lore has a really weird way presenting itself but GOD damn is it amazing

[5:32:59] <Futurecity10> @RioGascar Not canon
[5:32:59] <+CyanDeadEye> Nicole is 458
[5:33:03] <$blistexthief> Cheer500 Sorry if this has been suggested before, I mostly watch the anime. There's a Halo themed deathcore band called Shadow of Intent, pretty fun stuff. Some of the songs are dead ass just quotes from the games. Might be more V's taste, not sure if you like that genre

[5:33:21] <TEEron11> when are we doing the best halo games? Spartan Strike and Assult?
[5:33:21] <%ChoculaUltra> Destiny Lore is honestly 10/10. The in-game shit we get they call story? Wooo boy, I don't even know where to start.
[5:33:21] <%wunp_fxs> boooo

[5:33:27] <%Andrizzleton> Dragon Age
[5:33:27] <+jisang0415> BUT HALO # ADS WERE GOD TIER
[5:33:27] <%RioGascar> halo 3 marketing budget was 40 million about
[5:33:28] <+jiggy_snipe> but still alot money goes to dev
[5:33:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheAdMerlin bullshit those are what combat forms eventually swell into
[5:33:32] <%phatmac16> Halo's ad campaign was huge
[5:33:36] <%DensityD> would you attack Little V with kancho? I would.
[5:33:36] <+netrac> isn't that a separate budget?
[5:33:36] <DatAsuna> oh speaking of cool war names: the thursday war
[5:33:39] <%Slimshazbot> @ChoculaUltra Its so heartbreaking
[5:33:39] <Torivore> Dragon Age?
[5:33:44] <+jisang0415> #BELIEVE
[5:33:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheAdMerlin those arent grunts
[5:33:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Halo 5s ad campaigns were a better story than the game itself
[5:33:50] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @ChoculaUltra true bungie doesnt know how to translate the lore in destiny to the gameplay

[5:48:18] <+fresliver> katjaLurk
[5:48:19] <%Slimshazbot> Did you ever hear the Admiral Cole the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Covenant would tell you. It's a UNSC legend. Admiral Cole was an admiral of the UNSC, so powerful and so wise he could prevent Covenant's retrieval of data that contained the location of Earth. It's ironic, he could stop the Covenant from learning about Earth, but could not stop them from arriving by accident. Cheer500
[5:48:19] <%Bigyanno> If you're honest about being a sellout it's OK
