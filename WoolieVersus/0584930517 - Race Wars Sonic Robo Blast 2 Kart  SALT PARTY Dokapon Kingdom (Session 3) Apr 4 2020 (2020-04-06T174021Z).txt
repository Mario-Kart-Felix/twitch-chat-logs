[0:14:21] <jackelzxaa> i think you need the controllers on before you start the exe?
[0:14:21] <limpingbeaver> why you guys so close to each other?

[0:14:51] <trackles_64> Thought he said Taskmaster
[0:14:55] <limpingbeaver> The covid do be spreading though
[0:14:58] <D00D64> controllers are plug and play, you should be able to connect with an ximput controller at any time
[0:14:59] <CasualAlohaFriday> 3ft - 6ft
[0:15:03] <@akuda_bar> I feel dumb because anything is possible is only an snl reference to me, I have no idea who Kevin Garnett is and why he's so full of possibilities

[0:17:04] <D00D64> absolutely it has onlineplay!
[0:17:04] <jackelzxaa> yeah it has online
[0:17:06] <glaciusinfinite> ALL GOOD
[0:17:07] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @WackyModder84
[0:17:10] <featherlan> SRB2K does indeed have online
[0:17:12] <jackelzxaa> you can do splitscreen PLUS online if you want
[0:17:27] <jackelzxaa> srb2 normal had online play too and splitscreen, and deathmatch/ctf ringslinger modes
[0:17:33] <jackelzxaa> woolie didnt even get into ringslinger
[0:17:36] <%jiggy_snipe> this music tho
[0:17:39] <+PorterOfGames> Wow... not a lot of people just go here when they start out, props for being one of the few that do, lol
[0:17:39] <jackelzxaa> which is grab rings throw rings
[0:17:39] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:17:40] <%Solidnick18> ok
[0:17:40] <featherlan> This game is the BETTER Mario Kart
[0:17:42] <@Solidus_113> Saturn pad
[0:17:43] <%TomFrancis_> LUL
[0:17:44] <jackelzxaa> fps controls in sonic physics
[0:17:45] <%lazuli_alter> the Sega Saturn pad
[0:17:50] <WackyModder84> Okay fine, apparently that still counts as a URL despite it not even being one. lol
[0:18:00] <jackelzxaa> srb2 and srb2kart are good games
[0:18:11] <pizzadarius25> Like, WAY better than Mario Kart!
[0:18:16] <featherlan> ^^^^^
[0:18:17] <jackelzxaa> srb2kart is apparently still working on the 2.0 version release which will add a real grand prix mode with ai
[0:18:18] <$Plus_On_Black> Was the Saturn pad legit, I can't remember?
[0:18:25] <jackelzxaa> currently the game is just time attack and versus
[0:18:44] <Ion_Laser> @plus_on_black it was a saturn/xbox hybrid
[0:18:53] <%lazuli_alter> @WoolieVersus Jawz is the red shell equivalent
[0:18:54] <WackyModder84> @WoolieVersus Sonic Smackdown is now on ItchIO and now has the final version 1.0 Release available. The game has HEAVILY EVOLVED since you last played it. HIGHLY Recommend you check it out again while Version 2.0 is in the works!
[0:18:57] <glaciusinfinite> Blue shell of the game
[0:18:57] <jackelzxaa> i think 2.0 is also gonna have more built in characters too with redrawn sprites?
[0:18:57] <+ventpercival> sonic 3 enemy
[0:18:59] <SixthSun2> Jawz is basically a Red Shell
[0:19:04] <featherlan> You can actually outrace the blueshell of this game, so it rewards you for racing good
[0:19:08] <D00D64> Jawz is the shark tobot dude from Hydrocity, he's the red shell!
[0:19:09] <pizzadarius25> Cool! The Computer players are gonna be made! Can't wait!
[0:19:20] <glaciusinfinite> oh i was wrong
[0:20:17] <$Plus_On_Black> @ion_laser I remember using it as a kid. I think it was dope to use in my opinion.
[0:20:17] <Malik1002> More sonic huh. This channel turning more and more into a furry dick convention
[0:20:20] <FaytxStay> Woolie learns
[0:20:31] <%Solidnick18> mario doesn't even do that i like that
[0:20:32] <D00D64> Orbital items wont slow you down, but bananas will drag you down, yes
[0:20:53] <portalmaster112> what game is this?
[0:20:57] <gluemanofficial> So this is "use your items"
[0:21:02] <D00D64> Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart!
[0:21:11] <Ion_Laser> @plus_on_black The saturn pads that retro-bit released last year are definitely legit
[0:21:40] <FaytxStay> @WoolieVersus The Twitch tag is called Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car.
[0:21:55] <featherlan> Awwww man, the bois ain't ready
[0:21:57] <FaytxStay> For this game, anyway
[0:22:19] <D00D64> yeah, we'd prefer if you use Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car, as Giant Bomb doesnt allow fangames, so we just went with an obscure, official one
[0:22:20] <featherlan> Yeah XD
[0:22:20] <$Plus_On_Black> Cheer500 I fucks wit you Woolie
[0:22:38] <@Solidus_113> DOOM GUY
[0:22:39] <pizzadarius25> I wish Twich would just make SRB2 and SRB2KART a game option.
[0:22:46] <featherlan> Who's gonna pick Aigis
[0:22:51] <@Solidus_113> Is that Kiryu on the left
[0:22:52] <elspiceweasel> have you ever seen sonic and obama in the same place? just sayin...
[0:22:53] <gluemanofficial> Choose your Sonic OC!
[0:23:04] <featherlan> That's Aigis
[0:23:04] <%Solidnick18> Eggman
[0:23:14] <D00D64> yeah, most of the bonuschars are SEGA or Sonic, but Doomguy get to be the special guest since its he Doom Legacy engine
[0:23:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:23:14] <Ion_Laser> @Solidus_113 Yes. Kiryu is a bonus character in the game

[0:40:22] <jackelzxaa> some stages are just recreating levels from 3d sonic games and mario kart
[0:40:23] <+zanzibar_junker> Nice to see you guys
[0:40:28] <supahrob64> "I blame everything but this time it's a real complaint"
[0:40:30] <%RioGascar> how has nintendo not sniffed this game out
[0:40:31] <DedlokPM> from behind that blue Tails looks like the cat from Tiny Toons
[0:40:35] <@Solidus_113> Doomguy is the only non-sega character
[0:40:36] <%Superbro64> @Solidus_113 if you want to ignore the smk ports, sure
[0:40:45] <astrofalcon1> oh god minh
[0:41:02] <featherlan> There's no Nintendo here
[0:41:03] <%Superbro64> not sure if atlus appreciates their ip being used either. Regardless, this is a fantastic game
[0:41:05] <featherlan> That's why
[0:41:06] <FaytxStay> Brakes
[0:41:06] <astrofalcon1> this is close
[0:41:08] <%DensityD> johns
[0:41:14] <Siregulus> @WoolieVersus for heavy characters you should be drifting way earlier into the turn
[0:41:15] <jackelzxaa> woolie should switch to blaze
[0:41:22] <+Qsmash_> characters don't matter
[0:41:25] <Aydarkzero> just keep blue fire the whole time Kappa
[0:41:28] <%lazuli_alter> Also, if you need an item, instead of mashing the item button, hold it and you'll get an item on the earliest possible frame. @WoolieVersus
[0:41:28] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus btw if everyone picks random you get a secret stage :)

[0:47:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Wanted gives more points on hit, but you get better items if you're wanted
[0:47:53] <%Superbro64> Kart is exceedingly good, given you can stand its learning curve
[0:47:59] <%RioGascar> It sure is
[0:48:05] <%RioGascar> Boring and procedural
[0:48:17] <FaytxStay> Big batttle maps are awful.
[0:48:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> And Minh, you're pretty much a mario kart 64 bomb
[0:48:24] <+b_aleph> Seasons don't fear the reaper
[0:48:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> you can either blow people up or give them items
[0:48:35] <%DensityD> that was slick
[0:48:38] <%RioGascar> Thing is are any maps even made for 3-4 players

[0:50:52] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah
[0:50:55] <D00D64> This is "Map Hell" for a reason
[0:50:56] <@Menitta> Windows 98 Brick Wall Screensaver
[0:50:57] <%RyTYoung> It's worse than Minecraft grass blocks
[0:51:00] <fateirony> wow persona, Mario... this game's just waiting to get C&Ded
[0:51:03] <%DensityD> is it the motionsick thing that woolie has, or the VR one that reggie has?
[0:51:05] <oyyzzo> woolie gonna vomit everywhere
[0:51:09] <SixthSun2> Yup, Map Hell indeed
[0:51:17] <%DensityD> because they both have to be special snowflakes with their motionsickness
[0:51:21] <$Plus_On_Black> Nintendo will be sending their thumb breakers
[0:51:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:51:22] <gluemanofficial> Woolie chasing the dude who's already dead

[0:51:38] <Siregulus> it CAN be play to win if you give someone an item first
[0:51:40] <Siregulus> ;)
[0:51:40] <%RyTYoung> I love spinning around at 900 miles an hour in any game I play
[0:51:41] <%DensityD> STEAL A LIFE
[0:51:43] <Klefth> You're playing to fuck with people
[0:51:47] <+Taglog7> SABOTAGE
[0:51:51] <%Superbro64> hence it being a hell map
[0:51:54] <%DensityD> NIF
[0:51:57] <%lazuli_alter> that's why it's in map hell
[0:51:57] <@Solidus_113> *not great for a small group
[0:52:02] <+gutlesscoward> cool
[0:52:02] <Monkeyweed21> Reggie revenge
[0:52:04] <Siregulus> all Hell maps are either cut or novelty iirc
[0:52:07] <jackelzxaa> the self destruct bomb seems like a bad item to have in the game
[0:52:08] <DarknessD42> COOL
[0:52:10] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus That wasn't the secret stage it doesn't work in battle mode
[0:52:16] <GunlaEXE> Map Hell is a set of alternative maps only accessible by lucky random rolls or all players hitting random. Many maps in Map Hell are older maps from past releases, both in Battle and Race pool. Peach's Castle actually has a race variant as well.
[0:52:18] <Monkeyweed21> it has an eggman logo
[0:52:19] <SixthSun2> @WoolieVersus This is a "penalty" stage you can get from Random, it's deliberately awful to dissuade you from doing Random ctoo much
[0:52:23] <%Superbro64> karma is what the ghosts are called
[0:52:23] <+sunsetserenity1> Minh may have won, but Reggie is COOL
[0:52:24] <Klefth> It has a robotnik face
[0:52:25] <adimcorner> aw yeah! Race War!
[0:52:26] <yeetdabsenpai69> AGAIN
[0:52:27] <+agumon9000> Restart
[0:52:34] <adimcorner> another one
[0:52:38] <Slapperpow7> Pause and switch maps
[0:52:39] <D00D64> you can level select from Battle to Race
[0:52:41] <+gutlesscoward> how do you stop battling in the race war?
[0:52:42] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @WoolieVersus Battle Mode started with mementos
[0:52:45] <Siregulus> You can force it into race or play 3 battle matches
[0:52:46] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus When in race mode, picking a battle stage switches you into battle mode
[0:52:48] <%DensityD> has woolie ever been part of a Warriors/Muso let's play?
[0:52:50] <jackelzxaa> why not just have every stage be good and no bad ones?
[0:52:56] <%DensityD> those muso games
[0:52:59] <%jiggy_snipe> wait is there a Memontos race map?
[0:53:03] <jackelzxaa> i wouldn't say punshing random is a good idea
[0:53:07] <@Solidus_113> 2HU
[0:53:07] <D00D64> woolie finally playing 2hu
[0:53:09] <jetswerve> SourPls

[0:53:16] <%DensityD> 2hu
[0:53:25] <Slapperpow7> @jiggy_snipe Theres a midnight channel race track
[0:53:30] <GunlaEXE> @jackelzxaa there isn't, Peach's Castle is generally a rare exception and the only case amongst the base game IIRC
[0:53:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> ya like jazz?
[0:53:36] <%jiggy_snipe> oh ok cool thx
[0:53:42] <Monkeyweed21> Woolie is now a 2hu fan
[0:53:53] <anarchistPastry> TOUHOU MUSIC??
[0:53:54] <%lazuli_alter> @SixthSun2 it's actually a map hell map, that was put there since it didn't age well
[0:53:58] <DarknessD42> That Saxophone is sex
[0:53:59] <jackelzxaa> there's so many tracks they could probably cull lower quality stages at this point

[1:07:16] <+sunsetserenity1> Minh did nothing wrong
[1:07:16] <+arknodem> Oh no. Minh's behelit was his voice!
[1:07:16] <olaksi> That's Ursula, not the Devil
[1:07:18] <+soFISHticated98> Minh stop before your throat starts to literally bleed
[1:07:19] <%DensityD> minh is a mermaid that made a deal with Ursula the sea witch
[1:07:19] <adimcorner> he's going the distance, he's going for speed
[1:07:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Sacrifice your voice for more time on the clock
[1:07:24] <+therabbles> Minh's sacrifice
[1:07:24] <Superdandy96> Mesphisto claimed another
[1:07:24] <petwisk> sacrificed t√¥ the Devil? call DoomGuy
[1:07:35] <+VariantX7> He's cutting off a limb to win again. Keep that same energy
[1:07:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> How can one man be so dedicated to winning?
[1:07:50] <jackelzxaa> ulala in canon colors, beat in future colors, and blue tails
[1:08:00] <%DensityD> gg on the random map
[1:08:04] <RamenRiderZ> Minh used Double-Edge
[1:08:05] <+soFISHticated98> yes
[1:08:08] <Mothman742> minh would use a behelit in a heartbeat if it ment he would win
[1:08:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> jesus minh
[1:08:08] <Hammatime8> Punished Minh
[1:08:09] <+soFISHticated98> this is how VA works

[1:08:24] <%HRDSalami654> Shin Darkness Minh.

[1:08:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Woolie, get some addons!
[1:08:29] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Anyways yall got super lucky so here is the run down. If everyone goes random you get a stage from a cup called "Map Hell" which includes broken old stages from prior builds or the hardest stages in the game. Yall got super lucky getting the same stage TWICE
[1:08:29] <moonologist> pro tip: yell from the diaphragm, not the throat

[1:09:13] <TwinsROkay> This stage seperates scrub from pro
[1:09:14] <jackelzxaa> rainbow road is the place you go when you die
[1:09:15] <KishinGrek> Here comes the salt
[1:09:16] <+Gutsandlove> LUL oh boy
[1:09:20] <%Superbro64> this map was FUN the first time I played it. Good memories
[1:09:21] <@Solidus_113> Race to Oblivion
[1:09:21] <Siregulus> @WoolieVersus protip: its generally better to drift into most of the turns
[1:09:32] <TwinsROkay> Every beginner goes here to die
[1:09:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Which rainbow road is your favourite, chat? I'm partial to the MK7 one myself
[1:09:44] <bestguy590> boost skip, is good skip
[1:09:45] <D00D64> Woolie doesnt know the tech
[1:09:53] <warmnoid> i like mk7's RR too
[1:09:54] <TwinsROkay> While every experienced player THRIVES in the tech
[1:09:55] <%Superbro64> I honestly feel like it took me MONTHS of playing this game before I got to grips with the drift / boost system
[1:09:57] <petwisk> Now The Salt Party Beggins truly
[1:10:00] <+therabbles> easy Reggie win
[1:10:09] <D00D64> and yeah, respawns are pretty harsh... at the moment. We've got plans to alleviate that
[1:10:10] <%Superbro64> this map is actually quite hard on beginners who dont know the system well
[1:10:21] <+soFISHticated98> well of course
[1:10:28] <+soFISHticated98> since when is Rainbow Road beginner friendly
[1:10:28] <%Superbro64> Does Woolie know there's dev(s) in chat?
[1:10:29] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:10:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> A good player can get Sub 1:20 here

[1:10:55] <%Solidnick18> woolies toobin
[1:10:57] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus I'm a singer, and a quick tip is for Minh to get some water, maybe even some hot tea, to relax is vocal cord from that outburst before, so it can relax and be a bit more ready for dokapon
[1:11:01] <KishinGrek> Go mihn
[1:11:01] <%lazuli_alter> @AlteisenReiseZ some have gotten sub 1:xx

[1:11:25] <+therabbles> from first to last
[1:11:27] <%Javaa01> Absolutely no competency
[1:11:29] <+therabbles> how the mighty have fallen
[1:11:35] <%Superbro64> the (non sim) racing genre is super fun when you get good at them
[1:11:39] <%HRDSalami654> Negative competency.
[1:11:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah I thought i was good at smash and then i went online
[1:12:05] <%DensityD> has woolie ever LP'd a warriors/musou genre game?

[1:12:17] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Anyways yall got super lucky so here is the run down. If everyone goes random you get a stage from a cup called "Map Hell" which includes broken old stages from prior builds or the hardest stages in the game. Yall got super lucky getting the same stage TWICE
[1:12:18] <%DensityD> how is his competence in that style?
[1:12:18] <Klefth> STOLEN

[1:20:03] <artificiallynatural> my problem with this game is how a lot of maps are really ambiguous with where you're supposed to go and it becomes a game of which map do you have memorized

[1:27:40] <SixthSun2> There's like 60 tracks in this, the guys barely touched on the variety in this
[1:27:42] <%Hawkbone_> This game is fucking packed
[1:27:42] <jackelzxaa> srb2 used to have levels you could get used to, but then they just focused on better design and now current srb2 2.2 is like the best 3d sonic there is

[1:29:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @jackelzxaa I think that's what they're doing for 2.0
[1:29:03] <jackelzxaa> having those harder tracks feels like it should be an addon track or a "expert mode"
[1:29:30] <%DensityD> LP'ers need big guiding arrows or quest indicators
[1:29:30] <Siregulus> it usually is indicating those turns most of the time, with scenery/arrows
[1:29:31] <jackelzxaa> i've been following more normal srb2 stuff more than srb2kart so i dunno what they've been doing for kart but i'm really excited to have a real grand prix mode at least
[1:29:32] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> don't like the tracks in this racing game. they need a pro who's good at kart track design
[1:29:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I heard they're cutting the bs mario kart por levels
[1:29:34] <%DensityD> KappaClaus
[1:29:36] <%RyuuAoi> That's just like life @woolieversus GET IN
[1:29:37] <SoupBowler> I'm gonna be honest, most of the tracks the game has are actually decent. There are some outliers, but I'd say they really only need to cut back on maybe 10 or so out of the main 60
[1:29:40] <%Hawkbone_> Oh I'm sorry, is that BITCH I hear?
[1:29:43] <Monkeyweed21> Whens sonic riders tho
[1:29:44] <%Superbro64> encore maps are fun because signposting still is rather poor and now you fight muscle memory
[1:29:46] <JetpackMcQuack> And if the game is in 240p
[1:29:53] <jackelzxaa> just take the hardmode tracks for addons yeah that'd be the balance
[1:30:12] <Infeirno23> vocal chord parasite

[1:30:28] <%SirGO0SE> that was powerful
[1:30:30] <jackelzxaa> let the people who play daily have hardmode because they can opt in but people just checking the game out should be able to have a great time too on their initial picks
[1:30:30] <%DensityD> Woolie that's what you get when you think you have power to put our voices in timeout
[1:30:31] <+GrassCannon> louder than For Breakfast WutFace

[1:31:37] <+Fenrein> Nah but steak is hella filling though
[1:31:37] <jackelzxaa> so i can imagine they'd do some hard bs for kart addons
[1:31:40] <+Grizzytron> nerf steak buff chicken wings

[1:32:31] <jackelzxaa> hope srb2kart 2.0 comes out sooner with all this corona
[1:32:33] <T_Sasquatch> eggs are trash
[1:32:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> Time is a man made construct. Eat a rotisserie chicken for breakfast and scrambled eggs for dinner.
[1:32:36] <Infeirno23> orange juice is the only permanent staple for me

[1:33:01] <NeroInfinite> To be honest I don't like olives either.
[1:33:01] <jackelzxaa> maybe srb2 gets some more levels done with devs being forced to stay home from their day jobs....
[1:33:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> Wait. people DRINK skim milk??? I thought people just use it as an ingredient

[3:01:09] <yeetdabsenpai69> @legacy0117 there is an item for that yes but it is rare
[3:01:14] <+InfiniteHav0k> @jevichrono Woolie is chasing a rabbit, Minh is saving towns and Reggie is going back to the castle
[3:01:14] <+soFISHticated98> poison doesn't kill Shubreaker

[3:01:54] <+kekkerscrew> It's taking this l ong because there's only one person in the cave too
[3:01:56] <%jiggy_snipe> he'll fight some boss that will rock him
[3:01:56] <+soFISHticated98> is the wabbit quest important, like does it give a castle like the dog quest
[3:01:57] <+Shubreaker> minh will die in 3 turns
[3:02:01] <+paladinstarbuster> reggie kill him before its too late
[3:02:13] <+InfiniteHav0k> Wabbit has a good item too
[3:02:15] <+kekkerscrew> If all of the players were in the cave someone would have gotten it by now
[3:02:22] <%Hawkbone_> The dog quest technically wasn't important either, neither of them advance the plot.
[3:02:26] <yeetdabsenpai69> @sofishticated98 believe it gives another castle yes
[3:02:37] <+soFISHticated98> the castle is important for winning

[3:20:40] <Jrocy247> The Wabbit is a side quest
[3:20:41] <%RioGascar> @kevlarkoala Because it should never have existed. It should never have seen the light of day. It was cursed from the very day it was born
[3:20:41] <%Hawkbone_> No
[3:20:41] <+PenGia> Sidequest, but worth a bunch
[3:20:41] <%rubbishbinge> wabbit is just a sidequest, the objective of the chapter is to kill the big reds
[3:20:42] <+kekkerscrew> Wabbit is a Sidequest
[3:20:42] <%Wool> It's a sidequest. Red Monster is Main Quest

[3:21:00] <yeetdabsenpai69> DO NOT TRUST THE MINH
[3:21:00] <Goat_Baka> Minh it's a sidequest
[3:21:01] <+agumon9000> Red Monsters

[3:21:43] <+projectmanatees> I mean he's kinda right with the dog thing
[3:21:44] <viewtifulr> he's trying some mind games on you dont listen
[3:21:46] <+Dimfish> minh might be right
[3:21:47] <CureMode666> minh is wqrong
[3:21:57] <starwolfgang> Minh is very wrong
[3:21:57] <+soFISHticated98> he's not trolling, he's just understandably confused
[3:21:59] <Jrocy247> The Red Monsters are your MAIN missions, they're the ones that progress to other regions on the map.
[3:21:59] <viewtifulr> one guy Minh
[3:22:00] <+gutlesscoward> minh is minh
[3:22:00] <yeetdabsenpai69> minh is big wrong
[3:22:02] <KRaZyAmmo> should go to the better weapon shop as well
[3:22:06] <+paladinstarbuster> Mihn is correct but not right
[3:22:06] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh's misremembering
[3:22:08] <+soFISHticated98> because this game is opaque as fuck
[3:22:08] <Goat_Baka> Minh is being either a liar or stupid and i don't know which is the funnier answer
[3:22:11] <%Wool> Is it because Minh can't see the Red monster
[3:22:14] <+TheotherKristian> *SALT ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

[3:22:46] <%rubbishbinge> dew it
[3:22:47] <Hammatime8> Or maybe you get the WHOLE twon?
[3:22:49] <Jrocy247> Honestly, Doing the King's Side Missions are a waste of time.

[3:23:05] <+projectmanatees> Red monster is usually the way to progess but sometimes there are different ways to progress like finding and npc or monster
[3:23:07] <+agumon9000> The wabbit is worth 10K times your number of weeks. So it would be 140,000
[3:23:12] <%jiggy_snipe> PogChamp

[3:38:34] <zenith0111> Minh has no defense LUL
[3:38:35] <+DrJamesWoods> Wait

[3:38:50] <+agumon9000> You guys are going too far into the speed strats
[3:38:58] <viewtifulr> is mihn trying for....glass wheel?
[3:39:01] <yeetdabsenpai69> that's cause spd isnt that good
[3:39:02] <Mrthefro> Team Reggie tries getting countered
[3:39:03] <%RioGascar> nah dont worry anout it
[3:39:18] <%GenesisKnight> Time for Church, Woolie!
[3:39:21] <zenith0111> Cleric PogChamp
[3:39:30] <%Mendin> Woolie gonna become his brother
[3:39:33] <+projectmanatees> Only dokapon
[3:39:34] <powerprotoman> woolie returns to the church news at 11
[3:39:40] <starwolfgang> Speed is more noticeable when it's low than when it's high
[3:39:47] <powerprotoman> their are but you need mroe jobs mastered
[3:39:47] <jevichrono> Darlington! It's time for Church!
[3:39:51] <+pectusumbra> You have to learn more jobs
[3:39:51] <+PenGia> There's others after you master two starter classes
[3:39:52] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie has a spear to go 30% dmg buff too
[3:39:59] <failboat13> Church of the ultimate truth
[3:40:01] <Zalthia> Wait, Thief goes into Cleric?
[3:40:01] <%GenesisKnight> Take me to church!
[3:40:01] <%RioGascar> i laugh honestly at the dokapon experts like ‚Äúaw man they dont even do stat allocation properly‚Äù when they lost their minds at seeing darklings
[3:40:05] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus You get that from mastering other classes
[3:40:08] <Zalthia> How does that work?
[3:40:08] <yeetdabsenpai69> later
[3:40:13] <+Dorf1> you unlock monk by mastering cleric
[3:40:13] <boogaleeboo> Church is a scam, didn't you know?
[3:40:14] <+kekkerscrew> You have to master other classes
[3:40:15] <powerprotoman> you mastered a single job woolie dont get ahead of yourself
[3:40:20] <Hammatime8> I don't see the thought behind thief to cleriv
[3:40:21] <failboat13> Woolie's cult is happenning whether he wants it or not.
[3:40:26] <%GenesisKnight> Go job change first
[3:40:28] <+paladinstarbuster> rape dwarf
[3:40:29] <Jrocy247> If you want Ninja, Go for Warrior next
[3:40:35] <%rubbishbinge> Master cleric for Monk
[3:40:35] <+nintega010> @WoolieVersus if you want ninja max warrior next. just looked it up.
[3:40:36] <trickquestionz> Just keep mastering classes, higher tier ones unlock from either that or weird items you can find.
[3:40:43] <zenith0111> G
[3:40:47] <+pectusumbra> 1/7
[3:40:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:40:48] <yeetdabsenpai69> @riogascar I'm mostly like that cause someone told them speed is this important thus dooming them
[3:40:49] <+InfiniteHav0k> Woolie get your next job right away!
[3:41:04] <%RioGascar> Fair i suppose
[3:41:05] <+pectusumbra> could always retreat and job change
[3:41:09] <+pectusumbra> become a cleric or mage
[3:41:11] <giga_bit> You should go grab your new job
[3:41:20] <trickquestionz> Also you keep getting salary from mastered classes even if you're not currently using it.
[3:41:21] <+DazzlingFuhrer> woolie do something
[3:41:22] <%RioGascar> but one person can basically tank this whole thing with their ‚Äústrats‚Äù
[3:41:30] <Jrocy247> Woolie's close to the monster anyway, so he might as well kill the monster
[3:41:35] <+InfiniteHav0k> Quicker you get the job the better, level everything early
[3:41:39] <Berendenn> oh maaaaan I want to watch this but ive only seen the youtube videos
[3:41:41] <KRaZyAmmo> also go to the weapon shop and get stronger weapon
[3:41:41] <jubejube56> You've got time to make your way back and level up on your way to the castle
[3:41:42] <giga_bit> You'll be like, halfway there in this single trip
[3:41:48] <%jiggy_snipe> yea Woolie's logic is fine
[3:41:52] <+Shubreaker> woolie you spent like two weeks in a cave for nothing
[3:41:53] <%jiggy_snipe> might as well try
[3:41:55] <+Dorf1> changin job early will result in better stats later on
[3:41:58] <zenith0111> You'll be wasting exp if you don't get the class
