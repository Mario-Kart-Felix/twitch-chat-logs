[0:06:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> SOMEONE PICK GARCHOMP
[0:06:33] <samiam1616> Decidueye is also a cool one, but something about him seems off in Pokken
[0:06:35] <rubbishbinge> seel the seal pokemon is the peak of creativity
[0:06:43] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus But what about Vergil in Granblue??
[0:06:43] <spawnzie> Didn't they add decidueye on switch?
[0:06:45] <empanadadejq> squirtle best gen 1 initial charizard is overrated
[0:06:55] <Personified134> BLASTOISE HAS A DRAGON INSTALL

[0:07:55] <AllRabbitProductio> It's sweet, but I still question this.
[0:07:56] <rubbishbinge> Typhlosion gets no respect
[0:07:56] <Dragon_Batman> Kickboxing Chicken eh?
[0:07:57] <T_Sasquatch> Blaziken is rad in general

[0:07:59] <+Wheelieman> gen 1 whyyyyy
[0:08:03] <TenretniQuin> eat dirt woolz those Pokémon are golden
[0:08:06] <$LightningLynx89> Pokemboomer
[0:08:07] <+D00msDayDan> genwunners are a blight
[0:08:11] <+FrenchTact1cs> Not even Rapidash tho. like wut
[0:08:12] <+CelioHogane> Okay yeah but PIKACHU LIBRE THO

[0:08:19] <Infinit_Phoenix> Weavile, Blaziken Gardevoir for my top 3 pokemon
[0:08:20] <cascadepersona> Lucario and Garchomp the goat.
[0:08:20] <%winds_0f_change> 2003 is too new for reggie
[0:08:21] <SomersaultJustice> I used pika libre in this game
[0:08:23] <$LightningLynx89> @D00msDayDan Genwunners need not apply
[0:08:34] <papertoonz1414> SwSh not SnS
[0:08:34] <Dragon_Batman> That shit is tough to do
[0:08:36] <+Okosisi89> I can't tell if that's an uncomfortably cute boy, or a particularly andro girl.
[0:08:37] <empanadadejq> my fav pokemon is zoroark because he cool and he has great hair
[0:08:37] <TenretniQuin> XATU F O R L I F E
[0:08:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> no swords and shield, do gen 5
[0:08:40] <fuji_92> LUL NUZLOCKE NEVER AGAIN
[0:08:43] <powerprotoman> Yo Reggie blaziken empoleon and decidueye are birds play them
[0:08:44] <@Menitta> The Pokemon are cool in this game. I like the somewhat realistic interpretations
[0:08:45] <rubbishbinge> Gen 3 & 4 are peak pocket monsters
[0:08:50] <T_Sasquatch> It was awful and great at the same time
[0:08:50] <Dragon_Batman> Not cuz it's hard or easy just that game doesn't play nice with those rules
[0:08:50] <+Bonessssss> original nuzlucke was great fuck the hate
[0:08:52] <+tuchpi> would a nuzloke even work in sowrd and shield? atpRtsd
[0:08:57] <%SirGO0SE> still mad at liam for hating snorlax FUCK
[0:08:58] <SomersaultJustice> I liked that lp, screw the haters
[0:09:00] <Solidnick18> nuzlocke was a one time thing
[0:09:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> that lp was great
[0:09:05] <$LightningLynx89> @rubbishbinge That's a weird way to spell Gen 5
[0:09:06] <%JustYudha> Nuzlocke gets emotional
[0:09:06] <+CelioHogane> @tuchpi yes, it can
[0:09:11] <+Bonessssss> based nuzlocke
[0:09:11] <+FrenchTact1cs> CURSED Nuzloke
[0:09:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> nuzlockes get emotional as fuck
[0:09:14] <Prevot> in practice nuzlockes are too grindy and boring for me
[0:09:16] <goose_attack_almanac> I'd watch Woolie and Reggie play Colliseum
[0:09:21] <Prevot> I'd rather do a monotype challenge
[0:09:21] <FabulousReindeer> that lp is great bg noise
[0:09:27] <@Menitta> you should do a Black/White Pokemon LP. That'd be interesting
[0:09:27] <Dragon_Batman> The nuzlocke was pretty good, the final stream was the hypest thing
[0:09:32] <@Solidus_113> Blastoise Kamina the HERO
[0:09:38] <T_Sasquatch> Nuzlocke only got good at the end , final stream failure
[0:09:38] <speximillian> Never 4get Ludi
[0:09:38] <@Menitta> That LP was great
[0:09:40] <Solidnick18> it was a amazing moment
[0:09:41] <+Bonessssss> lp was good
[0:09:42] <fuji_92> LUL R O U G H
[0:09:43] <DatAsuna> "what is grass weak to again?"
[0:09:47] <+tuchpi> I LOVE THE NUZLOCK
[0:09:47] <+Bonessssss> stream was hype
[0:09:54] <peachy996> The only LP to require twitch to finish
[0:09:55] <%FenixSeraph> I liked it personally
[0:09:56] <SomersaultJustice> if you streamed that nuzlocke now, it would be fire
[0:09:57] <WanderingSwordsman> The hypest LP on youtube!
[0:10:00] <@Menitta> MEANS TO AN END
[0:10:00] <+tuchpi> the mumbling was the best part
[0:10:01] <+M08Xrd> Bye I'm going to YouTube to watch that
[0:10:07] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus But what about Vergil in Granblue???
[0:10:09] <andrei11dr> I Nuzloked Pearl and Black it was really fun
[0:10:15] <Superdandy96> A live stream nuzlooke would be fun
[0:10:17] <Solidnick18> i feel that
[0:10:19] <speximillian> I'd love to see a Nuzlocke of Sw/Sh, that game's barely 5 hours long when you know what you're doing
[0:10:21] <%FenixSeraph> who's the third person
[0:10:22] <%SirGO0SE> agree
[0:10:23] <AllRabbitProductio> Fair
[0:10:26] <+FrenchTact1cs> stream was the hype in the end
[0:10:29] <andrei11dr> Iea
[0:10:30] <+LastHazzerd> abstraction isn't as interesting
[0:10:35] <Dragon_Batman> That's about right

[0:16:21] <Nova_Revenant> KAMINA
[0:16:22] <%blastazoid00> Blastoise has weird thighs
[0:16:25] <+M08Xrd> Woolie your face's off frame
[0:16:29] <Personified134> THE KAMINA GLASSES DON'T COUNT
[0:16:30] <Personified134> ANIME ONLY
[0:16:32] <+Bonessssss> blastoise's weird proportions in this game always fucks me up
[0:16:36] <ALTRNico> Nia doesn't sound natural
[0:16:36] <andrei11dr> I picked Fire Ape,but Empoleon is sick as well
[0:16:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> boss character with low health but other than that nothing else is changed
[0:16:40] <Solidnick18> oh that looks weird
[0:16:41] <PleasantLeech> blasetoise is too old to fight
[0:16:43] <kingkeldeo31> hold - to skip lesson
[0:16:45] <Superdandy96> Guess what Reggie, Balatoise beats charizard! Water beats fire! PJSalt

[0:16:51] <BloodiaMK2> oh my god
[0:16:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> man he looks stupid
[0:16:55] <+buttdirt> don't remember blastoise having ass jets
[0:17:02] <%Madbearv> Woolie go watch Castlevania
[0:17:03] <SchlongKongEduardo> blastoise flips
[0:17:05] <MayorRev> Nia's cute
[0:17:07] <+RadDude6969> yo Blastoise looking a little wack in this
[0:17:08] <speximillian> Fact: Wartortle and Blastoise originally belonged to seperate evolution lines in the beta version of Red/Blue. Their lines were eventually merged, and that's why Wartortle looks so different from Blastoise.
[0:17:12] <BloodiaMK2> @WoolieVersus You think Blastoise has better dance moves than Bowser?
[0:17:17] <%LordSDB> Ass water PokBlastoise lul
[0:17:23] <+Doc1790> @WoolieVersus I know you don't play the games anymore but Blastoise got a massive buff in Sword/Shield through a move called Shell Smash.
[0:17:30] <%humbelpie> i arrived a bit late who's the other person on the couch besides Woolie and Reggie?
[0:17:41] <peachy996> Wartortle is a good boy, Woolie is blind as always
[0:17:51] <saiyanblitz> Does Blastostie have water finger guns
[0:17:55] <speximillian> Shell Smash aka ARMOR PURGE aka "Screw defense, I'm fast and powerful now"
[0:18:04] <SomersaultJustice> @Doc1790 Blastoise has shell smash now!? I need to go back
[0:18:12] <+RadDude6969> Blastoise got Shell Smash? sick!
[0:18:12] <%JustYudha> Blastoise's leg bend is making me feel uneasy
[0:18:14] <itsgundamu> @Doc1790 I thought Blastoise didn't make it into Sword and Shield?
[0:18:15] <+taggerung403> shell smash is cast off
[0:18:25] <rubbishbinge> Blastoise got some scary proportions
[0:18:26] <+Bonessssss> rain dish blastoise tho
[0:18:32] <%humbelpie> Pikachu Libre is a female pikachu thus making her a Punch/Suplex Girl
[0:18:33] <+Doc1790> You can put him now via transfer
[0:18:36] <papertoonz1414> hey woolie hold up is duel phase
[0:18:37] <deviljhojho_> pokeymanz
[0:18:38] <samiam1616> Blastoise is weird with like, actual legs
[0:18:40] <Ipsenscastle> blastoise looks like a man in a blastoise suit
[0:18:47] <@chesterr01> @humbelpie Ouistiti
[0:18:55] <TenretniQuin> henshin cast off change T U R T L E
[0:18:59] <@chesterr01> name of our guest for tonight
[0:19:00] <SirBrawler18> Fucking love Pokken guys
[0:19:07] <%humbelpie> @chesterr01 thank you for the info
[0:19:10] <FuqBoiSlim> What tf is up with blastroise's legs?? we're they always like that?
[0:19:17] <SomersaultJustice> how do you pronounce Ouistiti
[0:19:19] <T_Sasquatch> Ouis titi LUL
[0:19:19] <$LightningLynx89> cheer500 Blasotise is the worst water starter type. He's not even the best water turtle Pokemon.
[0:19:21] <A_wild_gallade> Pokken is a fantastic game
[0:19:29] <papertoonz1414> it's just pokken
[0:19:30] <samiam1616> I think some pokemon are better in Duel/Field at that
[0:19:33] <rubbishbinge> whens feraligatr
[0:19:36] <itsgundamu> I don't see Blastoise in the Sword and Shield pokedex so I don't know what your talking about
[0:19:38] <peachy996> @LightningLynx89 What's the other water turtle
[0:19:43] <TenretniQuin> wees teetee?
[0:19:46] <speximillian> Pokken is great and has an actual circuit sponsored by Nintendo, unlike Smash
[0:19:46] <SchlongKongEduardo> DansGame nice take
[0:19:47] <papertoonz1414> pokken gave him more legs
[0:19:49] <FuqBoiSlim> Is it Carracosta??
[0:19:52] <@Menitta> Like Chandelure will always wanna be in field
[0:19:56] <PleasantLeech> oshawot is worst water starter
[0:19:56] <EspurWick> Pokken making people realize blastoise is ugly LUL
[0:19:58] <%humbelpie> @SomersaultJustice im guessing its pronounced WEE-TEE-TEE
[0:20:02] <SomersaultJustice> add Honchkrow
[0:20:05] <SirBrawler18> some characters excel more in a certain phase. Gardevoir is great in field, Machamp us good in duel for example
[0:20:05] <lazuli_alter> you mean it's sponsored by The Pokemon Company
[0:20:07] <T_Sasquatch> I googled ouistiti and got a literal monkey I've never seen or heard of LUL
[0:20:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:20:10] <papertoonz1414> RAIN DANCE
[0:20:10] <ALTRNico> Kreygasm
[0:20:12] <$LightningLynx89> @peachy996 Carracosta
[0:20:14] <andrei11dr> I would love a Pokken sequel
[0:20:15] <lazuli_alter> I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA
[0:20:16] <goose_attack_almanac> I BLESS THE RIANS
[0:20:16] <buerdo> Pokken for glory?
[0:20:29] <%JustYudha> He looks better from that angle
[0:20:30] <MichaelDood> He loves it Kreygasm
[0:20:32] <+starpunchghost> Oh wow! is this a for glory ep?
[0:20:36] <+DrBunni> I love Blastoise's rain dance
[0:20:37] <goose_attack_almanac> yes
[0:20:38] <Personified134> DO COMBO
[0:20:39] <+Doc1790> Oh I'm getting flashbacks now
[0:20:47] <FuqBoiSlim> its woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[0:20:47] <peachy996> Pfff no Carracosta looks stupid get outta here
[0:20:48] <%humbelpie> is Pikachu Libre any good in this?
[0:20:48] <Nova_Revenant> taunt?
[0:20:49] <papertoonz1414> it's a high stance
[0:20:50] <%Louie_Salmon> It seemed to make him wet.
[0:20:59] <%Louie_Salmon> So that's a plus.
[0:21:00] <SirBrawler18> it leads to differrnt moves like up x
[0:21:01] <speximillian> High and low stances do stuff. I'd guess Rain Dance charges meter?
[0:21:04] <FuqBoiSlim> carracosta is based whatchu mean???
[0:21:05] <+Doc1790> I remember I set this game to Japanese because a lot of the English voice acting sounded dry in this game
[0:21:07] <+Virtual_Rays> Each pokemon's up input in duel phase usually has a special effect. Not sure what Blastoise does though
[0:21:11] <papertoonz1414> high stance and low stance have different buffs
[0:21:34] <+taggerung403> carracosta is better than drednaw at least
[0:21:37] <Applecannon63> oh god Blastoise fighting style is like that of E honda
[0:21:40] <SomersaultJustice> swords beat axes woolie
[0:21:43] <PleasantLeech> rain dance in normal pokemon weakens fire and strengthens water attacks
[0:21:56] <speximillian> If E Honda had water cannons on his back, yeah
[0:22:03] <+Doc1790> I mean. Blastoise looks like an E Honda. Kappa
[0:22:09] <SomersaultJustice> B. Honda
[0:22:09] <samiam1616> And if he was a giant turtle
[0:22:24] <$LightningLynx89> E. Honda did have that Kappa costume in SFIV Ultra
[0:22:26] <peachy996> Blastoise needs hundred hand slap from now on
[0:22:30] <+fgc_lemon> Blastoise is worst character in the game be careful
[0:22:31] <buerdo> I think rain dance buffs water attacks
[0:22:37] <SomersaultJustice> I remember switching all the buttons
[0:22:41] <someweirdo227> Kappa Honda
[0:22:43] <andrei11dr> Empolion>Blastoise just saying
[0:22:45] <speximillian> Machamp has the 100 hands
[0:22:46] <Reverend_Roscoe> how come there's so many ads all of a sudden on twitch?
[0:22:47] <+fgc_lemon> He is
[0:22:56] <peachy996> @speximillian That's fine too
[0:22:59] <peachy996> I like that
[0:23:00] <Applecannon63> empoleon is overrated
[0:23:05] <+fgc_lemon> Empoleon is my main, and He’s bottom 3 but above blastoise
[0:23:05] <%Felhad> woolieREMEMBERS
[0:23:20] <peachy996> Empoleon is pretty cool
[0:23:24] <someweirdo227> Feraligator 4 lyfe
[0:23:26] <$LightningLynx89> Primarina is best Water-starter
[0:23:33] <%OUTheTeam> OUTheTeam subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[0:24:13] <deviljhojho_> that means cool in cantonese
[0:24:15] <peachy996> Grass Starters are hit/miss imo
[0:24:17] <Idon__> Specials in this game scale mega hard
[0:24:19] <+taggerung403> no love for samurott?
[0:24:24] <b_ikki> all these guns he doesnt use in the games
[0:24:24] <Idon__> *supers
[0:24:26] <speximillian> Pokemon with a Mega form, like Blastoise, usually get all their moves upgraded while in Synergy Mode
[0:24:28] <papertoonz1414> time for a cool animation
[0:24:33] <BloodiaMK2> THOR IS HERE
[0:24:35] <deviljhojho_> oh baby

[0:24:49] <arkv01> gamefreaks gotta outsource this animation shit
[0:24:51] <speximillian> Yoooo Mega Blastoise is a goddamn Scopedog
[0:24:53] <fist_wizard_jay> Blastoise is a BOSS
[0:24:54] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL that's cool
[0:24:55] <+prime_name> Not as cool as Charizard
[0:24:56] <someweirdo227> Stablizing ice beams...
[0:24:56] <+TruSanKyuu> God thats cool
[0:24:57] <deviljhojho_> still the best since 1994
[0:24:59] <Personified134> the fact that they abandoned Mega Evolution after one gen should be all the evidence required to prove that Game Freak are incompetent cowards and the license should be given to other devs
[0:24:59] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:25:00] <+Dumple_Roe> rasengein?...
[0:25:01] <arkv01> blastoise is a mafia boss
[0:25:01] <FuqBoiSlim> Samurott is based but I wished he was part fighting-type and he had higher special atk
[0:25:03] <Zayasu> rip mega evolutions atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:25:04] <ALTRNico> Remember, Woolie LOVES Naruto
[0:25:04] <samiam1616> May as well skip puberty while we're at it
[0:25:05] <Personified134> mega evolution is the SICKEST SHIT
[0:25:05] <+LastHazzerd> i can't sit here listening to worturtle hate
[0:25:07] <BloodiaMK2> @bustawof Say sike right now

[0:25:14] <rubbishbinge> Shift to VECTOR CANNON MODE
[0:25:16] <%dantejoestar21> totally doesn't notice it's a vektor cannon

[0:25:23] <deviljhojho_> Funnel check
[0:25:24] <Idon__> warp digivolve like in digimon
[0:25:25] <SomersaultJustice> ironically you can do that in SwSh
[0:25:26] <+CelioHogane> @Personified134 "Abandoned" is a fun way to say "Saved them for the DLC"
[0:25:27] <samiam1616> Shotgun the Rare Juice
[0:25:31] <FuqBoiSlim> Rare Milk
[0:25:33] <%JustYudha> Jesus lmao
[0:25:33] <Personified134> @speximillian gen 3 remakes are not a seperate gen
[0:25:33] <SomersaultJustice> kinda
[0:25:39] <deviljhojho_> hey man, as long as it works
[0:25:40] <+taggerung403> are there even any water/fighting aside from keldeo?
[0:25:40] <Idon__> GARCHOMP
[0:25:41] <MichaelDood> Wartortle skipped LUL
[0:25:44] <Idon__> aww
[0:25:50] <+RadDude6969> I mean we got exp candies now so we can basically do that!
[0:25:50] <@Solidus_113> It's a sword with eyes
[0:25:50] <andrei11dr> Hes cool ,just overrated as fuck compared to all the other water starters
[0:25:51] <SomersaultJustice> Wind Waker enemymon
[0:25:51] <Dragon_Batman> Ghost sword
[0:25:52] <FuqBoiSlim> @taggerung403 There's Poliwrath

[0:25:56] <rubbishbinge> Decidueye
[0:25:57] <FuqBoiSlim> that's it
[0:25:58] <peachy996> Skipping phases would be great tho
[0:25:58] <Explodincatz> Woolie will abuse his Pokemon cause it didnt grow up how he wants
[0:25:59] <Sauceboss15> what the hell is wrong with wartortle?
[0:25:59] <PleasantLeech> PokDarkrai is best
[0:25:59] <%JustYudha> This is a weird roster
[0:26:02] <%humbelpie> sword boi
[0:26:03] <speximillian> @Personified134 X/Y, OR/AS, S/M
[0:26:04] <%OUTheTeam> woolie's gonna love mecha naruto's super in NUNS4 KappaHD
[0:26:07] <samiam1616> There's also an Inpachi in the Dojo stage
[0:26:09] <ALTRNico> Jojo training?
[0:26:14] <papertoonz1414> ghost steel
[0:26:16] <Personified134> @speximillian there were no new mega evolutions in S/M.
[0:26:19] <Idon__> They introduced this pokemon in the game not called "sword and shield"
[0:26:25] <+taggerung403> @FuqBoiSlim dam i forgot about him
[0:26:26] <someweirdo227> Chandelure was my main 4 pokken
[0:26:28] <deafmelone> he does ogre stuff
[0:26:33] <%VCRUZZO> so its an actual stand
[0:26:35] <+theman515> Who's the guest?
[0:26:42] <Applecannon63> its basically anubis
[0:26:46] <%Louie_Salmon> The tutorial lady's voice is so goofy
[0:26:52] <Idon__> Divekick except it's yourself and you're a sword
[0:26:54] <+Psycosis> are the other mics low or is it just my setup?
[0:26:54] <speximillian> @Personified134 If you're counting only new megas, then you *do* count OR/AS, but not S/M. 2 Gens
[0:26:54] <%humbelpie> isn't one of Pikachu's moves in this Heihachi's Electric Wind God Fist from Tekken?
[0:26:57] <+CelioHogane> Aegislash is cool, but Honedge is cooler.
[0:26:58] <FuqBoiSlim> @louie_salmon shes trying her best
[0:27:03] <fetrigon> Sorry @someweirdo227 I meant @prime_name
[0:27:04] <Idon__> Not just one, Pikachu is literally a Mishima
[0:27:11] <+jiggy_snipe> @theman515 Ouistiti
[0:27:11] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:27:18] <JetpackMcQuack> Is the flying sword bad at range
[0:27:21] <arkv01> Pokken: m ∀ r s edition
[0:27:24] <ALTRNico> good bot
[0:27:25] <SomersaultJustice> sick pokken mods
[0:27:25] <+taggerung403> Pokken restoration mod lul
[0:27:28] <Personified134> @speximillian X/Y and ORAS is one gen, just drop it lol
[0:27:29] <someweirdo227> @fetrigon lol yeah I wondered where that energy came from
[0:27:31] <BloodiaMK2> Yoga Fire!
[0:27:34] <Applecannon63> Lucario is like Leo Klieson combined with Lars
[0:27:34] <rubbishbinge> Pokken restoration mod dping its job
[0:27:44] <%humbelpie> @Idon__ that is hilarious, i can imagine Heihachichu tossing a Kazuya-Pichu down a volcano
[0:27:45] <Idon__> Pokombo
[0:27:46] <FuqBoiSlim> LETS SEE THOSE CHANDELURE COMBOS WOOLIE COME ON SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
[0:27:46] <SomersaultJustice> Poke Combo
[0:27:53] <+Psycosis> cannon dive
[0:27:55] <UnfilteredComic> I played the fuck out of this game when it first came out on WIIU, managed to get top 70 in the world. Stopped playing because people just abused disconnecting.
[0:27:56] <SomersaultJustice> should order some poke
[0:28:13] <speximillian> Heihachu is actually pretty strong, too.
[0:28:20] <+pectusumbra> will look forward to catching this vod, for now, good night
[0:28:25] <UnfilteredComic> Super fun though, wish i went to tournies
[0:28:30] <arkv01> did heihachu throw his pichudown a cliff
[0:28:34] <%OUTheTeam> king sheild
[0:28:44] <peachy996> @arkv01 you know he did
[0:28:46] <+nekodelic> it would be nice to have the name of the guest in the stream title instead of just "the woolie versus show"
[0:28:50] <+Psycosis> PokMaskedpika PokMaskedpika PokMaskedpika PokMaskedpika PokMaskedpika PokMaskedpika PokMaskedpika
[0:28:52] <speximillian> It was the birth of Pichu's devil gene....
[0:28:52] <arkv01> I need that anime
[0:28:58] <UnfilteredComic> Its like a Counter Hit @WoolieVersus
[0:29:00] <peachy996> Jinpachi Raichu under the temple
[0:29:08] <speximillian> That's why Pichu was top tier in SSBU
[0:29:09] <someweirdo227> Aegislash OP, the parts of it that aren't a literal shield are a soul stealing blade. It's basically Sould Edge minus Siegfried
[0:29:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> btw skill points do affect the online
[0:29:40] <%humbelpie> seeing as this was made by the Tekken team did Harada work on this?
[0:29:42] <Idon__> This game is MEGA RPS
[0:29:45] <Applecannon63> Oh yeah isn't some pokemon use some certain special moves based on SC?
[0:29:46] <PleasantLeech> im sure the guest will get full credits on youtube
[0:29:46] <%The_Timo> Minh wouldn't know
[0:29:52] <SomersaultJustice> rip minh
[0:29:54] <papertoonz1414> poor Minh
[0:29:55] <Solidnick18> like minh
[0:29:55] <%FenixSeraph> RIP Minh
[0:29:59] <Dragon_Batman> Rip Minh
[0:29:59] <SomersaultJustice> low tier eyes
[0:30:01] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:30:04] <%humbelpie> RIP Minh
[0:30:05] <+M08Xrd> rest in pepperoni
[0:30:05] <Idon__> A loooootta moves come from SoulCal and Tekken
[0:30:07] <samiam1616> If any fighting game was gonna get real RPS on it, it may as well be Pokemon
[0:30:08] <%JustYudha> Damn he's not even here lol
[0:30:11] <speximillian> I know Gengar is the strongest character in the game, but ONLY during SC
[0:30:15] <Idon__> Garchomp is just Bryan Fury
[0:30:17] <%Louie_Salmon> Unviable eyes
[0:30:18] <someweirdo227> Minh was chaotic evil, he had to be stopped
[0:30:20] <@Menitta> I think Harada was involved with developing this game
[0:30:23] <Idon__> Gardevoir is just Lili
[0:30:28] <Idon__> etc etc
[0:30:35] <SomersaultJustice> it's important for everyone to have a character flaw, that is minhs
[0:30:36] <lazuli_alter> pikachu is almost a direct heihachi reference
[0:30:36] <FuqBoiSlim> SUBOPTIMAL VISION LUL
[0:30:36] <andrei11dr> I wish Giratina was in this,
[0:30:41] <+bustawof> whos steve fox
[0:30:47] <Idon__> No one, rip
[0:30:48] <+taggerung403> hitmonchan?
[0:30:49] <@Menitta> Gardevoir has Asuka stuff too
[0:30:51] <hellkhat> whos aska
[0:30:55] <speximillian> There's a ton of support pokemon, I think Giratina's one of them
[0:30:56] <+bustawof> dam :(
[0:31:02] <+Virtual_Rays> Just think of it as a counter hit
[0:31:05] <lazuli_alter> literal RPS mechanic
[0:31:08] <+nekodelic> it's DOA
[0:31:11] <arkv01> thank you pokemom
[0:31:11] <Idon__> you literally get armor if they beat you in the RPS
[0:31:15] <peachy996> You could have a lot of Pokemon turned into SC and Tekken movesets
[0:31:24] <FuqBoiSlim> is heracross playable in this?
[0:31:28] <Idon__> Nope
[0:31:28] <UnfilteredComic> Focus attack is good in this, you can cancel it easily
[0:31:29] <lazuli_alter> no
[0:31:33] <speximillian> No bugs
[0:31:44] <FuqBoiSlim> damn....
[0:31:49] <speximillian> Pinsir would have been sick
[0:31:49] <SomersaultJustice> I don't think you can counter during a ground string though, so it's not fully doa
[0:32:03] <speximillian> Or...wait, Scizor's in game
[0:32:03] <+DigitalPelican> there's scizor tho, one bug
[0:32:04] <Korgororo> scissor bug is in though
[0:32:04] <PleasantLeech> scizor tho
[0:32:05] <peachy996> Oh yeah this roster isn't very big is it?
[0:32:15] <deviljhojho_> mew does some wacky bullshit
[0:32:18] <peachy996> Compared to like Tekken or SF
[0:32:26] <PleasantLeech> it's a pretty decent roster
[0:32:31] <deviljhojho_> yeah the roster is a bit average, not many fighting types either
[0:32:31] <speximillian> There's like 30 characters in DX?
[0:32:34] <SomersaultJustice> it's bigger than like, granblue
[0:32:35] <Dragon_Batman> Yea that would be pretty good
[0:32:41] <SomersaultJustice> and samsho I think
[0:32:42] <papertoonz1414> if you wanna spam assists use Braixen
[0:32:46] <Applecannon63> Heracross or Golisopod would've been perfect
[0:32:47] <speximillian> I think the base game on WiiU only had 15
[0:32:51] <deviljhojho_> needed at least 5 more fighting types
[0:33:01] <peachy996> Hopefully Pokken gets a sequel
[0:33:10] <someweirdo227> When's Quagsire?
[0:33:18] <SomersaultJustice> Pokken 2: Pikhachi Mishima is dead
[0:33:42] <speximillian> Support calls are not free, you can't guard when you call a support
[0:33:46] <@Menitta> I remember at launch everyone used Cresselia/Reshiram
[0:33:47] <BloodiaMK2> oh god
[0:33:51] <@CrankyVT> when magikarp festival tho
[0:33:54] <BloodiaMK2> Pikachu is Heihachi in this game
[0:33:56] <FuqBoiSlim> Wii u version only had 15 with shadow mewtwo unlockable
[0:33:59] <BloodiaMK2> I forgot!
[0:34:02] <+charmquarke> god I remember reshiram meta
[0:34:04] <peachy996> @SomersaultJustice I am literally humming the beat to tekken 3 intro right now lol
[0:34:13] <andrei11dr> Iea i remember seeing Reshiram everywhere
[0:34:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:34:25] <FuqBoiSlim> me and reshiram lubbychudder
[0:34:25] <%JustYudha> Digerbsy thoooo!
[0:34:28] <+nekodelic> motivate myy pokemon
[0:34:31] <SomersaultJustice> I mean, Pokemon Rumble is basically Tekken Force if you really think about it
[0:34:36] <samiam1616> Base game was 16, Arcade then got a few more which would make their way to Pokken DX on Switch, and then DX got Decidueye, Aegislash, and Blastoise on top of that
[0:34:39] <ALTRNico> Kappa
[0:34:41] <FuqBoiSlim> Diggersby tho?
[0:34:53] <speximillian> Cheering is basically your comeback factor. Nia cheers harder for you if you lose a round
[0:35:57] <SomersaultJustice> is this game still alive online on switch? I remember the Wii U had really great matchmaking even with a small base
[0:36:05] <@Menitta> There's some online presence
[0:36:07] <Personified134> Ayy Gee slash?
[0:36:14] <@Menitta> The netcode for this game is complete ass
[0:36:16] <+RichardMF_> this isn't smash we have fun turned on here
[0:36:41] <andrei11dr> Im so mad i can't remember wat my fucking Fire Ape was actually called, cuz i name my Pokemon stupid shit LUL
[0:36:49] <+charmquarke> fox gang fox gang
[0:36:52] <SomersaultJustice> Infernape?
[0:36:53] <+taggerung403> infernape?
[0:36:59] <andrei11dr> Yea thank you
[0:37:05] <SomersaultJustice> Son Goku
[0:37:13] <BloodiaMK2> Eh

[0:37:21] <hellkhat> lol
[0:37:21] <speximillian> Monferno
[0:37:28] <andrei11dr> I was close
[0:37:31] <Dragon_Batman> Infernape da best
[0:37:33] <+taggerung403> id sacrifice a child to get electivire into a sequel
[0:37:42] <BloodiaMK2> I just wish Swampert was in this
[0:37:47] <0rond> who's the guest?
[0:37:48] <%SirGO0SE> or just mudkip
[0:37:49] <BloodiaMK2> For obvious reasons
[0:37:58] <hellkhat> i need a gohst and dragon eevee
[0:37:58] <SomersaultJustice> I wish they could add Incineroar, but at least he got into smash
[0:38:01] <hellkhat> then i can die
[0:38:03] <Dragon_Batman> Ouistiti @0rond
[0:38:07] <SomersaultJustice> they can add hawlucha
[0:38:19] <BloodiaMK2> Wait, Decidueye?
[0:38:21] <BloodiaMK2> what
[0:38:28] <papertoonz1414> yeah
[0:38:30] <Personified134> haven't seen chat say it yet although I haven't paid much attention, so i'll just go ahead and say it
[0:38:31] <speximillian> Think the newest pokemon in here is Decidueye
[0:38:33] <Personified134> THIS IS THE STANCE
[0:38:34] <BloodiaMK2> O_o
[0:38:34] <FuqBoiSlim> Heracross and Lopunny could've been neat
[0:38:35] <0rond> do they have a twitter?
[0:38:37] <papertoonz1414> he was added in this version
[0:38:45] <Personified134> Lopunny is the furry choice
[0:38:46] <trashcansan> everytime I hear reshiram, I hear "lubby chuddah"
[0:38:50] <Dragon_Batman> No clue honestly
[0:39:00] <rubbishbinge> I love reshiram
[0:39:07] <hellkhat> gardevoir already the furry representative
[0:39:09] <artificiallynatural> reshuraaaaam
[0:39:12] <FuqBoiSlim> @personified134 they already got Gardevoir. the damage is already done
[0:39:12] <SomersaultJustice> is the reshiram thing just mudkipz for a new generation?
[0:39:40] <speximillian> Blaziken is in here, I think Maximillian plays him whenever he tosses this game in, because it's just Sagat
[0:39:45] <+FadingEmber> Decidueye was the worst Alolan starter. Don't @ me cause I'm already gone.
[0:39:52] <FuqBoiSlim> idk bout new generation. ppl knew about justinrpg for a while
[0:39:55] <trashcansan> the reshiram thing is mudkipz irl
[0:40:04] <SomersaultJustice> I remember liking blaziken in this game
[0:40:23] <papertoonz1414> decidueye
[0:40:25] <BloodiaMK2> @FadingEmber Shadow Tag
[0:40:31] <+Dragoneye77> destroy the furry SwiftRage

[0:42:39] <+TruSanKyuu> Dragonite is sick
[0:42:39] <Lionkevinson> Who’s the guest?
[0:42:43] <arkv01> dragonite is a chunky good boi
[0:42:47] <Ipsenscastle> Dragonite's original sprite was intimidating as fuck
[0:42:49] <rubbishbinge> Mega Ray o-o
[0:42:49] <Solidnick18> Dragonite is great
[0:42:50] <$LightningLynx89> Woolie just has bad taste in Pokemon
[0:42:53] <+Doc1790> @FenixSeraph Because the roster was decided by who was popular in Japan.
[0:42:57] <fkknsoftaubrey> dragonite is v cute ok
[0:42:57] <+FrenchTact1cs> dragonite is a doofus lookin AssDragon
[0:42:59] <%FenixSeraph> why does the narrator lady look so much like Da Vinci from FGO
[0:43:02] <FuqBoiSlim> Dragonite is kinda based. I had one in SoulSilver and she carried me through Kanto
[0:43:03] <Korgororo> bear on mind I think they actively avoided putting too many fighting types since they didn't want it to just be humanoids
[0:43:04] <andrei11dr> Dragonite is the lamest dragon type
[0:43:07] <@Menitta> It was gamepad instead
[0:43:10] <LeafarOz> pog
[0:43:14] <speximillian> Lucario is the Ryu of this game, Reggie should be ok
[0:43:14] <kingkeldeo31> dragonite is a good boy
[0:43:21] <hellkhat> dragonite looks like he cant read
[0:43:24] <LeafarOz> this game <3 ♡
[0:43:24] <%FenixSeraph> Dragonite is great, quiet you
[0:43:26] <+taggerung403> pretty sure drampa is the worst dragon
[0:43:29] <someweirdo227> Dragonite isn't meant to be cool. He's a goofy idiot and I love him
[0:43:34] <trashcansan> dragonite sux
[0:43:36] <fuji_92> dragonite is cool shut up
[0:43:38] <+Superbro64> 30 fps fighting game locally LUL
[0:43:41] <+jiggy_snipe> Dragonite isn't menacing =/
[0:43:42] <+Psycosis> Japanese lore
[0:43:43] <+Superbro64> that sucks, woof
[0:43:44] <+FrenchTact1cs> Charizard with downs
[0:43:45] <+TruSanKyuu> Stop this Dragonite slander
[0:43:45] <quietshun> dragonite is fine
[0:43:49] <SomersaultJustice> I used to make a dragon dance outrage dragonite and call it Hulkamania
[0:43:52] <Personified134> incorrect, the lamest dragon type is drampa
[0:43:55] <hellkhat> dragonite only ok cuz its strong
[0:43:56] <andrei11dr> Shark boy is best dragon type
[0:43:57] <+jiggy_snipe> he's a nice dragon
[0:43:57] <kingkeldeo31> It's shaped like a friend Woolie
[0:44:02] <papertoonz1414> it's almost like blastoise Kappa
[0:44:03] <rubbishbinge> drampa is a friend
[0:44:03] <+Punchasaur> dragonite has big boomer energy
[0:44:05] <+Doc1790> My favorite Dragon is Hydreigon
[0:44:05] <FuqBoiSlim> The worst dragon type has to be Alolan Eggxecute
[0:44:07] <+Superbro64> Are pokken tournaments lan play then?
[0:44:16] <lazuli_alter> yes
[0:44:17] <@Menitta> they are lan
[0:44:21] <Personified134> @FuqBoiSlim YOU TAKE THAT THE FUCK BACK
[0:44:22] <%FenixSeraph> can Tyrannitar be an honorary dragon line
[0:44:23] <speximillian> Victini is best assist, someone argue me
[0:44:30] <Personified134> THE LONG BOI IS MY SON
[0:44:38] <hellkhat> flygon is my fav
[0:44:41] <trashcansan> wait is alolan eggxecute seriously dragon type
[0:44:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Personified134
[0:44:47] <FuqBoiSlim> @fenixseraph can it learn dragon dance? honorary dragon
[0:44:49] <HungryHungryEmu> dragonites are bad ass if they have a pissed off attitude
[0:44:51] <SomersaultJustice> these load times are faster than wii u
[0:44:57] <rubbishbinge> ampharos is a nice dargon
[0:45:00] <HungryHungryEmu> Lances draonite is a psychopath
[0:45:06] <+JWalnut> wow Blastoise's arms are looking weirdly long
[0:45:10] <+nekodelic> @Personified134 why are you booing him, he's right Kappa
[0:45:11] <@Solidus_113> OOF
[0:45:15] <@Solidus_113> OOF THIS SCREEN
[0:45:16] <%FenixSeraph> @FuqBoiSlim yes it can, so I guess it does
[0:45:19] <someweirdo227> Dragonite is Barney with the power to murder children
[0:45:20] <BloodiaMK2> Does the music in Pokken stack up well?
[0:45:22] <%JustYudha> oh ew this screen
[0:45:23] <%FenixSeraph> Beldum is the worst pseudo-Legendary line
[0:45:28] <kingkeldeo31> that looks real bad
[0:45:29] <Idon__> pokken music is pretty nice.
[0:45:29] <HungryHungryEmu> cap^
[0:45:32] <@Solidus_113> this is awful
[0:45:41] <Personified134> oh this splitscreen layout is Not Good
[0:45:44] <NeroInfinite> Get rekt
[0:45:47] <+Superbro64> woolie should of got 2 switches woolieSMUG
[0:45:49] <FuqBoiSlim> bro what????

[0:45:55] <@CrankyVT> shades of re5 co-op
[0:45:57] <+FrenchTact1cs> he wasnt readyyyyy
[0:45:57] <NeroInfinite> Also split screen ispain
[0:45:58] <FuqBoiSlim> what's with this layout?
[0:45:58] <andrei11dr> This is going like it would in the actual game LUL
[0:45:58] <trashcansan> woolie choosing boss characters once again
[0:46:02] <Dragon_Batman> Cuz playing on the gamepad is not great
[0:46:02] <+DigitalPelican> goddamn i did not know of this split screen
[0:46:10] <FuqBoiSlim> also is this in 30fps??
[0:46:14] <lazuli_alter> yes
[0:46:15] <@Solidus_113> We really don't need this splitscreen
[0:46:19] <@Solidus_113> it's not good
[0:46:26] <HungryHungryEmu> id rather suffer through the 30fps
[0:46:26] <Zayasu> is it 60 fps without splitscreen?
[0:46:35] <+R_BChe> its 60 without splitscreen
[0:46:36] <+Superbro64> Is single screen play that terrible? Im going to go with a yes
[0:46:39] <trashcansan> it seems needed for the 3d space
[0:46:40] <Personified134> boys pop your DTs
[0:46:41] <SomersaultJustice> man I remember always struggling hard against zoning in this game
[0:46:44] <%JustYudha> imagine playing splitscreen on the Switch version lol
[0:46:44] <+FridayStreamer> are you able to connect 2 switches with LAN so you can play at 60fps local?
[0:46:52] <%Louie_Salmon> The idea with split screen is that the player close to the camera has a better view, so it's not fair. But yeah
[0:46:58] <+JWalnut> wow he actually used the cannons
[0:47:04] <arkv01> DOSUKOOOI
[0:47:06] <+FrenchTact1cs> thats hype. fuck you

[0:49:32] <$LightningLynx89> @andrei11dr Excuse me, the new term is Pokeboomer
[0:49:56] <%TheOneCalledRock> i wonder if the online in this game is still alive
[0:49:58] <trashcansan> what's wrong with the split screen? it seems pretty needed for judging distance in a 3d arena
[0:50:06] <+taggerung403> swsh was better than i expected, but worse than i hoped
[0:50:07] <FuqBoiSlim> Oh....my....god...is that blastoise from...

[0:59:35] <marvel877> I got to get back into this and work on my Gardevoir.
[0:59:41] <Personified134> F
[0:59:49] <+TeethMuncher> do beamo
[0:59:51] <papertoonz1414> GET PEEDED ON
[0:59:52] <%TheOneCalledRock> is weavile still really quick in this game?
[0:59:55] <UnfilteredComic> Didnt use burst
[1:00:03] <Queen_Grimlock> whoever this other person they're playing with is, she's a demon at chandelure
[1:00:04] <Jflaskd13> chandalure ids still top tier i see

[1:00:09] <someweirdo227> Local foot fetish not so tough after getting molested
[1:00:12] <SafCar009> my only issue with splitscreen is 30 fps gameplay
[1:00:13] <FuqBoiSlim> This is just Peacock from Skullgirls in 3d
[1:00:24] <@Menitta> This is why the game needs a sequel
[1:00:27] <speximillian> Chandelure's got that big Overheat, that does big damage, but debuffs him afterwards. The Mew Assist clears the debuff from him...it's a good combo that shows game knowledge
[1:00:32] <andrei11dr> So many Pokemon emotes wooliePOYO
[1:00:32] <@Menitta> Not splitscreen is ass and splitscreen is ass too
[1:00:50] <+Blurry15> PokChandelure PokChandelure PokChandelure PokChandelure PokChandelure PokChandelure PokChandelure PokChandelure PokChandelure
[1:00:57] <SomersaultJustice> DIVE KICKU
[1:00:59] <kingkeldeo31> But which one is less ass Menitta?
[1:01:01] <+Ancopro> PokMachamp
[1:01:06] <Hammatime8> I mean, more people die by getting crushed by chandeliers every year than people getting kicked to death by birds.
[1:01:07] <@Menitta> This honestly.
[1:01:07] <papertoonz1414> OVERHEAT
[1:01:12] <Korgororo> it's impossible to fix that aspect of the game because it's a 3d fighter
[1:01:28] <arkv01> yeah but like right now, they're in the sme perspective
[1:01:29] <Queen_Grimlock> NOICE
[1:01:36] <arkv01> so they imght as well try turning off splitscreen
[1:01:37] <SomersaultJustice> reggie has gained knowledge
[1:01:46] <arkv01> go for the tekken feel
[1:01:47] <@Solidus_113> Soul Caliber and tekken don't need splitscreen
[1:01:53] <Idon__> spinny chandelure kick
[1:02:07] <papertoonz1414> PEE
[1:02:12] <SomersaultJustice> use your bursto
[1:02:13] <andrei11dr> Reggie needs to use the power of the Fire Chicken
[1:02:13] <UnfilteredComic> @Menitta If only nintendo/pokemon committed to make this more than an arcade port
[1:02:13] <Idon__> soul cal and tekken also don't turn into an arena fighter though
[1:02:15] <arkv01> anyone know how big woolies tv is?
[1:02:18] <@Menitta> I really like how unique the game's structure is but the local suffers because of it
[1:02:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:02:18] <FuqBoiSlim> overheat did like 30% good lord
[1:02:20] <Solidnick18> reggie is so scared
[1:02:27] <FuqBoiSlim> HE SCURRED
[1:02:28] <Queen_Grimlock> i would be too
[1:02:34] <Hammatime8> The range game on that lighting fixture is NASTY
[1:02:35] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:02:39] <%TheOneCalledRock> you know what mad me upset about this game? not shiny alts
[1:02:41] <Korgororo> that's because they don't have long range fights or excessive jumping
[1:02:45] <Idon__> everything in this game does big damage it's crazy
[1:02:46] <@Menitta> I mean this is more than the Wii U arcade port. There's no splitscreen on the Wii U versiion
[1:02:52] <@Solidus_113> where's the supers
[1:03:00] <speximillian> Chandelure's amazing online lol, all the projectiles are great on nintendo wifi
[1:03:01] <%LordSDB> Reggie choosing the top tier woolieSMUG

[1:08:50] <SafCar009> i know in shield it has a laser it can angle
[1:08:53] <Finaldragoon> also Overheat debuffs Chandelure, just like in the game

[1:08:57] <SafCar009> *shield forme
[1:09:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> man the online in this game isn't good.
[1:09:15] <someweirdo227> @andrei11dr it is
[1:09:17] <FuqBoiSlim> @andrei11dr you guessed correctly
[1:09:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> wifi warriors are out tonight
[1:09:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[1:09:31] <MiraiNoUsagi> does the pokemon have anime voices here?
[1:09:35] <SafCar009> i
[1:09:40] <MiraiNoUsagi> like actual voices and not cries
[1:09:52] <FuqBoiSlim> sounds like it
[1:09:59] <Jflaskd13> can we see our resident pro try other characters also for a more even match later? @WoolieVersus
[1:10:05] <SafCar009> no it's cries and grunts but it's officially VAed
[1:10:07] <Applecannon63> they use their own vas
[1:10:12] <arkv01> not even mewtwo?
[1:10:17] <speximillian> Yeah at most you learn maybe 3 characters in this game
[1:10:18] <MiraiNoUsagi> Cause aegislash sounds like a middle age strong man
[1:10:28] <speximillian> For team battles
[1:10:29] <Applecannon63> except pikachu and the other cutesy pokemon
[1:10:45] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[1:10:45] <speximillian> Cuz 3 v 3 CVS style battles are a thing in this game
[1:10:46] <NeroInfinite> Summmmons words but he can't do shit LUL
[1:10:49] <spardanwarrior> Yes, but only the japanese anime voices. As in Charizard doesn't say "Charizard" he says "Lizardon"
[1:11:13] <$Noponiz> chandeleure is the coolest ghost type FREE
[1:11:17] <FuqBoiSlim> Unovachads win again

[1:13:01] <@Menitta> Gengar is gross
[1:13:04] <@Solidus_113> Magical Girl Braxien
[1:13:16] <BloodiaMK2> That's the idea
[1:13:16] <Solidnick18> YEYEYE
[1:13:21] <Solidnick18> Let's go
[1:13:26] <FuqBoiSlim> Gengar doing Bayo's side taunt Kreygasm
[1:13:33] <andrei11dr> Fly me too the moon,and let me bathe among the stars SingsNote
[1:13:40] <FuqBoiSlim> uhhh I mean forget you saw thay
[1:13:50] <sperium3000> Wait what's up with the splitscreen? The one time I played this game it didn't have that
[1:13:57] <speximillian> Gengar's gimmick is his ability to cancel big moves into fast moves, hitting people with Sucker Punches. He also has the best Synergy Mode in the game, and some of his moves can steal meter
[1:14:02] <+Ancopro> Triple
[1:14:05] <SafCar009> it's an option @sperium3000
[1:14:16] <SafCar009> it's the wrong option, but an option to be sure
[1:14:19] <arkv01> switch version has splitsreen, probably for rooftop gaming LUL
[1:14:21] <Korgororo> though it would've made sense for the cast to be all fighting types you get more visually interesting fights with the diversity
[1:14:23] <sperium3000> Does that make it better? I think it's hella distracting
[1:14:26] <PFlare> I doubt he's reading chat, but he needs to give some Brax tips.
[1:14:30] <@Solidus_113> It's awful
[1:14:31] <PFlare> Brax is long range.
[1:14:53] <SafCar009> splitscreen hives both players the same control scheme, but it cuts the FPS to 30
[1:14:55] <+taggerung403> why are mega evos so much better than dynamax
[1:14:56] <PFlare> And he's not using half her moveset. I'm guessing he never touched this before?
[1:15:00] <someweirdo227> Dark Phoenix Gengar?
[1:15:01] <UnfilteredComic> Unblockable
[1:15:03] <speximillian> Braixen, meanwhile, passively charges assists faster, and can charge them even faster with Morning Sun. Morning Sun also powers up a lot of her other moves. She plays more like a keepaway zoner, ideally...
[1:15:07] <xThomasWellertonx> mega gengar is just FUCK YOUR SHIT MODE
[1:15:48] <+Virtual_Rays> @speximillian Pre-patch OG Braixen still scares me...
[1:15:52] <SafCar009> @pflare there was a FNF of it but not much aside from that
[1:16:13] <andrei11dr> I almost forgot to ask...
[1:16:13] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @PFlare
[1:16:14] <laserbeaming> Hell Yeah Pokken
[1:16:16] <speximillian> Pre-Patch WiiU Braixen was scary AF...zoning nightmare
[1:16:18] <@Menitta> Gengar is fuggin good
[1:16:18] <PFlare> Oh, sorry.
[1:16:25] <andrei11dr> WATS THAT SMELL,
[1:16:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:16:32] <PFlare> She's still good at zoning.
[1:16:35] <samiam1616> Reminder of the reason the Pokken EVO winner played as Braixen
[1:16:39] <+Ancopro> YaHoo!
[1:16:45] <+Virtual_Rays> @speximillian As a Charizard main since day 1....I can confirm
[1:16:49] <+taggerung403> ganbatte mahou shoujo braixen-chan
[1:16:58] <@Solidus_113> respect the hustle
[1:17:18] <BloodiaMK2> Do the Gengar Shuffle
[1:17:19] <arkv01> braixen is so cute... I can't believe people would lewd her ScaredyCat
[1:17:24] <NeroInfinite> Braxin is just a magical girl
[1:17:26] <speximillian> Yeah, Garchomp can sometimes get in on her with dig, but a good Braixen sees it coming and just blocks/counters i
[1:17:32] <+Virtual_Rays> I still love the fact that Braixen has Xiaoyu two hit swipe
[1:17:45] <PFlare> That's Xianghua.
[1:17:46] <rubbishbinge> Was that a blanka ball?
[1:17:55] <+Jackeral> Holy crap, I thought this game was forgotten. I fucking love playing Sceptile in this
[1:17:56] <JetpackMcQuack> Quagsire :)
[1:17:59] <arkv01> cute VoHiYo
[1:18:05] <Korgororo> it's both really
[1:18:09] <PFlare> ...Yeah.
[1:18:09] <papertoonz1414> i think it's a hold button for sunny day
[1:18:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> seriously, the online in this game is abysmal
[1:18:16] <BloodiaMK2> Braixen has that perpetual smug look on her face
[1:18:17] <speximillian> Spam Morning Sun to with with Braixen. It fills your assist meter too
[1:18:18] <FuqBoiSlim> WE LOVE YOU BRAIXEN-CHAN ❤❤❤
[1:18:29] <%TheOneCalledRock> i forgot the fenikin line were biased of withes and wizards
[1:18:39] <SafCar009> shame because the online has a rematch option too
[1:18:41] <WackyModder84> They're not playing SPLITSCREEN are they? Splitscreen is capped at 30 FPS in this game!
[1:18:44] <%TheOneCalledRock> based*
[1:18:53] <+taggerung403> the kalos starters were mage/warrior/rogue
[1:18:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> remember, EVO winner won this game at EVO so there would be more Braixen porn
[1:18:57] <Korgororo> Mahou shoujo idol braixen was a big brain idea
[1:18:59] <FuqBoiSlim> all of the kalos starters are based off of rpg classes
[1:19:10] <speximillian> Yeah, a good Braixen is super hard to catch, they can stall out real good in Duel Phase
[1:19:24] <fuji_92> Braixen: "YAHOO-HAAA!" LUL
[1:19:39] <+Ancopro> 'this party's gettin CRaZy!'
[1:19:51] <arkv01> psycho balll!!
[1:19:54] <PFlare> Braxien also has some stupid combos.
[1:19:56] <Aydarkzero> Infernape still isn't in this game :(
[1:20:10] <PFlare> With the right assist she can rip off 50% life in one combo.
[1:20:11] <kingkeldeo31> Braixen is also a Tsundere
[1:20:13] <BloodiaMK2> @Aydarkzero Blaziken fills that niche already
[1:20:19] <Korgororo> blame blaziken for that NotLikeThis
[1:20:23] <Aydarkzero> @BloodiaMK2 not as cool
[1:20:24] <FuqBoiSlim> Give it time. Pokken 2 will be announced any day now BibleThump
[1:20:32] <sunnythedrunk> I just realized Gengar did Janemba moves before dbfz
[1:20:32] <+taggerung403> how many archetypes can we fit into braixen
[1:20:41] <$Noponiz> infernape is literally just wu kong for the 500th time
[1:20:42] <BloodiaMK2> @Aydarkzero Too bad
[1:20:42] <+taggerung403> she an ojou-sama too?
[1:20:49] <SomersaultJustice> fire spin
[1:21:03] <FuqBoiSlim> does she do the laugh?
[1:21:04] <speximillian> Braixen's a Little Witch Akademia
[1:21:05] <$Noponiz> monkey king is so tired
[1:21:09] <BestTeaMaker> braixen is a magical girl basically

[1:22:01] <%Irridium> sent right to the shadow realm
[1:22:03] <@Solidus_113> let's play without splitscreen for a while
[1:22:03] <UnfilteredComic> SOUL VORE
[1:22:07] <rubbishbinge> That was Venom's IK
[1:22:09] <SomersaultJustice> another dimension
[1:22:12] <BloodiaMK2> Quite literally the Shadow Realm
[1:22:13] <WackyModder84> Are they playing splitscreen or are they using two different screens?
[1:22:13] <arkv01> UR SOUL IS MUNCH MUNCH
[1:22:19] <speximillian> YeYeYe

[1:22:31] <FuqBoiSlim> YOUR SOUL IS....delicious
[1:22:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> charizard is FUCKING COOL
[1:22:37] <deafmelone> Garchomp does Bryan stuff yeyeyeyeye
[1:22:40] <andrei11dr> MY DRAGON BOY PogChamp
[1:22:40] <xThomasWellertonx> Machamp just jojos your shit
[1:22:43] <$LightningLynx89> Not my fault Charizard is so fucking cool
[1:22:44] <%LordSDB> Mashima Pikachu!
[1:22:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> BUT IT'S TIME TO GET EATEN BY THE DRAGON BOI
[1:22:50] <speximillian> Garchomp has the whole RPS set in his normal moveset, so he plays Grab Attack Counter even more than other fighters
[1:22:59] <WackyModder84> Charizard = Devil Jin.
[1:23:01] <sunnythedrunk> Charizard is pretty cool andbuff in this game
[1:23:02] <WackyModder84> Garchomp = Bryan Fury
[1:23:04] <coroquetz> bryan fury vs soul calibur
[1:23:04] <FuqBoiSlim> >admitting to liking Charizard in the year of our lord 2020
[1:23:04] <PFlare> muhahahahaha
[1:23:05] <Glaicus> GARCHOMP HYPE!
[1:23:08] <FuqBoiSlim> CRIIIINGE
[1:23:09] <thatjuantoo> Did they show woolie Croagunk's galactica phantom?
[1:23:15] <laserbeaming> I fucking love Pikachu in this game. I wanted him to get some of his moveset here in Smash
[1:23:16] <andrei11dr> His high tier right?
[1:23:18] <speximillian> He's got a counterattack stance, a command grab, and also a solid projectile game in arena phase
[1:23:25] <%FenixSeraph> I still laugh that they had to change it from Emonga because it had the word "Mong" in it
[1:23:38] <laserbeaming> Electric Wind God Fist Pikachu is probably the coolest thing in pokemon
[1:23:38] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:23:39] <kingkeldeo31> they haven't touched crogunk yet
[1:23:40] <PFlare> But he can attack off wallsplat.
[1:23:47] <speximillian> He's also got big damage but big lag on his moves, too...high risk, high reward character that rewards big reads
[1:23:53] <Korgororo> emolga sounds better anyway SeemsGood
[1:24:07] <@Menitta> Emolga the best pikaclone dont @ me
[1:24:17] <laserbeaming> Garchomp has Bryan moves!
[1:24:23] <laserbeaming> He's really cool
[1:24:29] <BestTeaMaker> but pachirisu won a championship
[1:24:31] <FuqBoiSlim> @menitta I am @ting you but only cuz you spitting fax rn
[1:24:46] <Applecannon63> Braixen having porn is not that surprising
[1:24:49] <boogz____> Who’s the other person playing rn?
[1:24:56] <thatjuantoo> @laserbeaming But does he have galactica phantom!
[1:25:03] <UnfilteredComic> Garchomp does big fuckin damage
[1:25:03] <SomersaultJustice> Chariot Tackle!
[1:25:10] <Korgororo> can't wait for Reggie to find the dig cheese
[1:25:11] <coroquetz> that's actually miguel's unblockable isn't it
[1:25:11] <andrei11dr> All the Pika clone ar trash expert for Memeq
[1:25:21] <Applecannon63> especially since someone main them and wishes everyone to make porn of her when he won
[1:25:23] <Dragon_Batman> Sick
[1:25:31] <andrei11dr> And i don't even play that game
[1:25:34] <sunnythedrunk> Damn that was awesome
[1:25:39] <speximillian> Magnet Bomb Sacred Sword is stronk
[1:25:46] <sunnythedrunk> I forgot how good the animations are
[1:25:48] <BloodiaMK2> Land Shark Dragon is hungry
[1:25:49] <Solidnick18> Mawhahah
[1:25:55] <speximillian> Garchomp's Super will full guard break
[1:26:03] <speximillian> It's also a Giga Drill
[1:26:15] <SuperUtopia> who's playing aegislash?
[1:26:17] <PFlare> I want to see if he rcognizes Garchomp's Bryan Fury punches- if he ever does the Field mode grab.
[1:26:24] <andrei11dr> My Boy be wining wooliePOYO
[1:26:27] <+taggerung403> its a shame flygon had to compete with garchomp for ground/dragon
[1:26:35] <FuqBoiSlim> reminder that stat-wise mega garchomp is worse than garchomp
[1:26:36] <$Noponiz> THAT'S OUR WORD
[1:26:36] <Applecannon63> garchim is straight up Weapon X
[1:26:40] <+ratearth> messy guessies
[1:26:48] <+Doc1790> Have they played on a different stage yet?
[1:26:52] <speximillian> Don't forget your assists
[1:27:01] <papertoonz1414> yes
[1:27:03] <MajoraZ> Oh man, I wish I had noticed this earlier, I actually play Pokken competitively.
[1:27:06] <empanadadejq> when's hyperfight coming
[1:27:06] <Applecannon63> Garchomp's super is literally weapon X
[1:27:18] <Applecannon63> but as a drill breaker
[1:27:23] <coroquetz> pokken hype
[1:27:23] <Korgororo> they might recognise the kicks as well
[1:27:26] <speximillian> @MajoraZ Please give us knowledge, I havn't played since WiiU
[1:27:26] <PFlare> They're barely skimming the surface of this.
[1:27:42] <MajoraZ> Has woolie and co figured out Aegislash's parry/move-cancelling-into-stance-changing-to-get-buff mechanics yet?
[1:27:48] <speximillian> Stone Edge is so great
[1:27:56] <Korgororo> ooh yeah the dig cheese Kreygasm
[1:27:59] <coroquetz> just frames PogChamp
[1:28:04] <Solidnick18> YE
[1:28:13] <Solidnick18> low profile that
[1:28:23] <Applecannon63> Man I wish this game's ver of Lucario playstyle was in Smash
[1:28:44] <coroquetz> lucario is feng wei + kilik
[1:28:45] <sunnythedrunk> Facts smash Lucario is fucking lame and cheesy
[1:28:48] <Applecannon63> Tetsuzanko for days
[1:28:51] <FuqBoiSlim> ayy ayy ayy
[1:28:59] <Korgororo> you can exit the dig without an attack as well as a bait
[1:29:07] <$Noponiz> i mena smash lucario is sick as well, aside the aura mechanic
[1:29:15] <UnfilteredComic> The footsies
[1:29:17] <Korgororo> it's solid
[1:29:18] <speximillian> Dragon Rush to counter at a distance
[1:29:21] <$Noponiz> love his stylish floaty martial arts ib smash
[1:29:45] <PFlare> Goddamnit, why does he never grab in field phase?
[1:29:52] <Applecannon63> the aura menchanic is great but I wish Lucario had a tetsuzanko and arrowstep kick
[1:29:58] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @MajoraZ
[1:29:59] <fuji_92> LUL
[1:30:04] <Solidnick18> didn't choke
[1:30:06] <PFlare> awwww.
[1:30:09] <PFlare> I wanted to read that.
[1:30:10] <%Louie_Salmon> Aw man
[1:30:12] <speximillian> Same
[1:30:15] <papertoonz1414> i wish lucario has bone rush in smash
[1:30:15] <coroquetz> aw
[1:30:19] <+Holo_vOiD> actually useful info limesCry
[1:30:22] <+AmanDotZip> me too
[1:30:23] <+croxeye> oh is this for glory? nice
[1:30:30] <+Doc1790> Now we will never know what he wrote
[1:30:35] <coroquetz> that was about slash's guard impact pretty sure
[1:30:38] <FuqBoiSlim> someone wrote a whole damn guide in the chat sheesh
[1:30:38] <Korgororo> the sin of too much knowledge TheIlluminati
[1:30:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:30:45] <PFlare> Finally.
[1:30:46] <papertoonz1414> byran attack
[1:30:49] <speximillian> Knowledge is forbidden in the house of Woolie
[1:30:50] <coroquetz> slash has soul calibur guard impact except he can combo off it
[1:30:51] <PFlare> Does he not play Tekken?
[1:31:12] <laserbeaming> Woolie doesn't play Tekken, he plays Steve Fox
[1:31:12] <Applecannon63> also Lucario's aura reppukens from this game
[1:31:16] <+DarkNerdShawny> Whoa I just got here. Im missing POKEMON TEKKEN????!!!!!
[1:31:25] <speximillian> Timer Scam
[1:31:27] <+taggerung403> ye liver blow
[1:31:34] <BloodiaMK2> Someone say Reppuken? dnoGEESE
[1:31:40] <thatjuantoo> You guys should check out Crougunk's training mode... he's got a cool move (back + X) :p
[1:31:44] <FuqBoiSlim> lame it out like x tekken
[1:31:45] <Korgororo> woolies not so much a tekken guy
[1:31:49] <PFlare> That's a bad idea.
[1:31:56] <andrei11dr> Should've learned dragon breath
[1:31:56] <PFlare> That's a VERY BAD IDEA, Woolie.
[1:31:58] <SomersaultJustice> YEYEYE
[1:31:58] <+DarkNerdShawny> I really wanna play this game, if it still wasnt $60 on the eshop 3 years later smh
[1:32:03] <+Who_lio42> he just do bryans punches?
[1:32:05] <SomersaultJustice> do the stunner!
[1:32:07] <Applecannon63> no seriously Lucario has reppuken even a kick ver of reppuken
[1:32:09] <PFlare> They're gonna get shredded.
[1:32:11] <speximillian> Pika Libre is speedy grab character
[1:32:12] <+jiggy_snipe> Pikajuan PogChamp
[1:32:14] <kingkeldeo31> R. Pika
[1:32:21] <+Bardemis> @WoolieVersus Garchomp steals a bunch of his normals from Brian Fury. Running heavy is just ff2 from T7.
[1:32:22] <PFlare> R. Pika crushes fools.
[1:32:22] <%FenixSeraph> but she's cute
[1:32:23] <BloodiaMK2> R. Pika
[1:32:26] <MajoraZ> Gonna try to use less space: Aegislash's main deal is on top of a parry, he can cancel into stance changes which change his moveset, and every time you change stances it confers buffs
[1:32:27] <Finaldragoon> yeah she's R. Pika
[1:32:27] <Applecannon63> R Pika is Thicc
[1:32:28] <AllTheZibas> R. Pika!
[1:32:30] <rcgama> Rainbow Pika
[1:32:32] <speximillian> R. Pika is potent rushdown but low HP
[1:32:32] <laserbeaming> Pika Libre is a rushdown grappler. It's wild
[1:32:34] <FuqBoiSlim> SOMEONE PICK CROAGUNK ALREADY
[1:32:36] <SomersaultJustice> I remember she's basically SFV R. Mika, where you get them in the corner and make them guess
[1:32:43] <Solidnick18> I like R pika super it's great
[1:32:44] <PFlare> @SomersaultJustice Yup.
[1:32:51] <laserbeaming> Pika Juanita. Pika Libre is always female
[1:32:51] <fuji_92> Rainbow Pika yeah
[1:32:52] <arkv01> la luchachu
[1:33:02] <marvel877> Pikachu Libre's female.
[1:33:04] <+Doc1790> Nintendo refuses to lower the price for a lot of their shit. LUL
[1:33:04] <PFlare> Only for this it's get them against the WALL, then time to flip the coin.
[1:33:06] <MajoraZ> Basically, changing from normal stance to the defensive stance gives you a zoner based moveset and perma armor. Changing from that stance back to normal gives you bufs
[1:33:07] <kingkeldeo31> Pika libre gets grabs and gets buff
[1:33:08] <thatjuantoo> @FuqBoiSlim Croagunk or feed XD
[1:33:12] <FuqBoiSlim> Pikachu's with heart-shaped tails are female
[1:33:16] <MajoraZ> those buffs give you an attack boost, but also enables extra just frames
[1:33:20] <SomersaultJustice> suplex!
[1:33:26] <Dragon_Batman> Ohh hey Pika Lucha
[1:33:31] <speximillian> ...Aegislash doesn't normally learn Rapid Spin, does it?
[1:33:33] <Applecannon63> man I wish we had Hawlucha join to fight R Pika
[1:33:34] <SomersaultJustice> STUNNER
[1:33:35] <papertoonz1414> STUNNER
[1:33:37] <+demegodz> STONE COLD
[1:33:39] <Solidnick18> STUNNER
[1:33:40] <AllTheZibas> PIKA STUNNER
[1:33:41] <Dragon_Batman> Bah gawd he is broken in half
[1:33:42] <+Doc1790> STUNNER
[1:33:42] <+taggerung403> i want to see king hang out with pika libre
[1:33:46] <%SirGO0SE> 3:16!
[1:33:50] <MajoraZ> If you achive a certain amount of stance changes with Aegislash in a single match, the buffs also change to give speed boosts on top of damage buffs
[1:33:50] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @speximillian
[1:33:51] <andrei11dr> MA GOD MA GOG MA GOD
[1:33:52] <+marrs_bars> IT'S A STUNNER sbfpYeyeye

[1:40:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> SWAMPERT
[1:40:25] <fuji_92> he really 8snt even the best turtle yeah
[1:40:27] <sunnythedrunk> Samurott is worse
[1:40:34] <@Menitta> I put sooooo much time into this game on Wii U. I wish I put more time into DX
[1:40:35] <%Irridium> ain't played this since launch on switch this gonna be interesting
[1:40:36] <empanadadejq> squirtle is def the best gen 1
[1:40:40] <Dragon_Batman> Yea the Sword starters has specific moves that are good
[1:40:43] <Artoo_The_Me> Torterra best turtle
[1:40:45] <@Menitta> I never touched the local lol
[1:40:49] <arkv01> we gonna see wifi teleports?
[1:40:52] <uchipz> imagine if he knew you had so many options out of double team
[1:40:53] <speximillian> Pre HGSS, Feraligatr was the worst, but he's pretty solid now
[1:40:58] <%FrostedZaibatsu> blastoise hate? hggGun woolieREGGIEFUL
[1:40:58] <+Numjoy> how big is the scene for this anymore?
[1:40:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> you're guest sounds like BMO
[1:41:00] <fuji_92> WHERE'S THE BRAZILIAN (blazi)KENS
[1:41:01] <Idon__> does the LOOP DE LOOP
[1:41:02] <PFlare> Yeah, he has it straight from the anime.
[1:41:08] <+Numjoy> How is using a gamecube controller for it too?
[1:41:09] <andrei11dr> I just realized they never picked Empoleon or the grass owl LUL
[1:41:09] <+nekodelic> it's a fighting game, unlike smash
[1:41:15] <%RyTYoung> I had a talking squirtle toy when I was little, I bonded with that piece of plastic!
[1:41:20] <PFlare> Direct from the episode.
[1:41:27] <SomersaultJustice> use the SNES controller
[1:41:34] <uchipz> team battle with 1 pokemon each lol
[1:41:34] <+Ancopro> wRong
[1:41:35] <FuqBoiSlim> Feraligatr is the only starter that gets an ice-type move by level up, I believe. so hes the best to me
[1:41:37] <@Menitta> thats search settings
[1:41:39] <Idon__> c'mon woolie it's just squirtle 2
[1:41:42] <@Menitta> wait
[1:41:43] <%jinking79> woolieMINHSTINCT

[1:41:54] <+taggerung403> chewtle is straight up the worst turtle
[1:41:56] <MajoraZ> Somebody tell woolie it's better to use group matches instead of the vs code, that way points can be disabled and a consistent stage size can be used
[1:42:01] <laserbeaming> Blaziken is Law
[1:42:03] <PFlare> Blaziken is Marshall Law.
[1:42:12] <+Superbro64> is blaziken as low tier as when max played him back on the wii u?
[1:42:14] <PFlare> LIBRE
[1:42:14] <CirclesForever> catch a pikachu hes the strongest of all

[1:45:04] <+Virtual_Rays> Pikachu Libre for Wrestlemania
[1:45:05] <WackyModder84> SWANTON BOMB
[1:45:05] <FuqBoiSlim> YIKES
[1:45:09] <speximillian> Hawlucha could have been Pika Libre
[1:45:09] <arkv01> grooming is IMPORTANT
[1:45:11] <biomegabear> for girls
[1:45:14] <bazz_tv> those are feathers
[1:45:22] <peachy996> For style Reggie
[1:45:24] <Zayasu> remember parents on amazon complaining about the crotch hair
[1:45:25] <kaudera> South Korea voted in Libre lol
[1:45:27] <PFlare> oraoraoraoraoraora
[1:45:29] <Idon__> Libre literally stole lucha's signature move lol
[1:45:31] <Korgororo> imagine not being able to tune out annoying sounds like some kind of animal Kappa
[1:45:31] <WackyModder84> @speximillian, 100% Agreed. Shoud, have been Hawlucha
[1:45:32] <kingkeldeo31> Go into settings, turn off commentator lady
[1:45:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> waiting to get in cause i went out of my way to get this game tonight
[1:45:49] <biomegabear> Garn is high tier?
[1:45:57] <Solidnick18> counter pick?
[1:45:58] <kaudera> Garde is mid low
[1:46:01] <uchipz> 3v3 seems to be the format officially
[1:46:03] <papertoonz1414> woolie got a bad match up
[1:46:12] <MajoraZ> @biomegabear gardevoir is generally considered low, but still viable
[1:46:18] <bazz_tv> so do machamps have actual shorts or is that skin?
[1:46:22] <SomersaultJustice> I remember watching that one year a machamp won evo
[1:46:23] <biomegabear> k
[1:46:23] <papertoonz1414> skin
[1:46:32] <speximillian> So what you're saying is that Chandelure poops on Machamp
[1:46:47] <kaudera> I mean zoners are the minority in the roster
[1:46:48] <MajoraZ> The thing to keep in mind is Pokken is super balanced so even characters towards the bottom are still viable
[1:46:51] <Dragon_Batman> Nice
[1:46:52] <Solidnick18> ORAAA
[1:46:52] <SomersaultJustice> COOL
[1:46:57] <samiam1616> Schrodinger's tier list
[1:46:57] <arkv01> @bazz_tv it better be skin cause otherwise the implication is machamps just have it hanging out in the wild
[1:47:02] <speximillian> But Machamp only needs to win 3 interactions to beat Chandelure
[1:47:05] <@Menitta> NOBODY PLAY GARDEVOIR
[1:47:07] <Solidnick18> the giant swing?
[1:47:09] <@Menitta> Keep the joke going
[1:47:10] <FuqBoiSlim> what a comeback
[1:47:14] <marvel877> @MajoraZ sounds about right. explains why gardevoir clicked with me so fast compared to other fighters.
[1:47:21] <kaudera> it's called submission lol
[1:47:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can also cancel the run with guard btw
[1:47:40] <fuji_92> SOME PLAY GAREEVOIR
[1:47:44] <bazz_tv> inb4 cloacas
[1:47:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> the grab run can be canceled by pressing guard
[1:47:49] <fuji_92> *someone
[1:47:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> so t's a free run approach
[1:47:57] <fuji_92> KILL THE JOKE Kappa
[1:48:01] <%Sparkseid> @menitta I still can't believe they missed her in the old video
[1:48:08] <PFlare> It's true, but he was just too far.
[1:48:09] <kaudera> Machamp has an air homing btw, press X while jumping when you feel it's safe in field phase
[1:48:14] <peachy996> They missed her twice LUL
[1:48:22] <%Irridium> good
[1:48:34] <peachy996> They missed her in Pokken and the other pokemon fighting game they played
[1:48:37] <+Wool> NO ONE PLAY GARDEVOI
[1:48:40] <speximillian> Oh yeah, Air Homing Attacks are a thing, forgot about those
[1:48:44] <FuqBoiSlim> Gardewho????
[1:48:52] <Finaldragoon> @Wool I play Gardevoir
[1:48:58] <Idon__> please MUTE HER already
[1:49:02] <biomegabear> So who is top tier?
[1:49:08] <Artoo_The_Me> Mia is the equivalent of the handler
[1:49:12] <FuqBoiSlim> Why do yall keep saying this made up name? is it a fan made pokemon or smth??
[1:49:26] <UnfilteredComic> NotLikeThis
[1:49:28] <arkv01> oh god I just remembered the bye bye handler mod LUL
[1:49:42] <andrei11dr> This is looking like Sagat Gief LUL
[1:49:45] <+charmquarke> red donut
[1:49:49] <FuqBoiSlim> bodied
[1:49:51] <Artoo_The_Me> What a good mod
[1:49:55] <peachy996> Gardevoir is just a beta name for what would end up being Gallade
[1:50:06] <+Superbro64> huh, this game has STATS?
[1:50:12] <+Superbro64> is that a thing in ranked?
[1:50:12] <PFlare> ...I like Gardevoir, though.
[1:50:17] <kaudera> @woolieversus that's wrong
[1:50:17] <FuqBoiSlim> @peachy996 b-b-based and dawn stone-pilled
[1:50:26] <VillainsLeague> Is this a stand battle
[1:50:26] <PFlare> Oh, good. Now you'll see what a real Machamp looks like.
[1:50:29] <kaudera> overheat ALWAYS beat throws
[1:50:31] <Idon__> Machamp is so much cooler than Incineroar wtf
[1:50:36] <WSintai> I am a grown ass adult who keeps a laminated Gallade pokemon card in my wallet at all times, because GALLADE IS THE BEST
[1:50:44] <kingkeldeo31> Wait, mirror matches give shiny colors?
[1:50:50] <ArrestedHouse> PokMachamp
[1:50:52] <PFlare> Not necessarily.
[1:50:54] <kaudera> no just alt colors
[1:50:55] <speximillian> Got that Ogre battlesuit
[1:50:55] <arkv01> ORAORAORA
[1:50:55] <PFlare> Just alts.
[1:50:57] <papertoonz1414> not shiny
[1:50:58] <Idon__> down A to ora on command
[1:51:00] <bazz_tv> I wonder if Pokken covers all the competitive fighter needs in the fandom or a 2d more traditional fighting game would still have a chance with the fanbase?
[1:51:01] <papertoonz1414> just alts
[1:51:06] <Idon__> machamp got bulk up
[1:51:12] <arkv01> oh SHIET
[1:51:22] <papertoonz1414> scary face
[1:51:24] <speximillian> Rock Throw!
[1:51:26] <Idon__> just A
[1:51:41] <speximillian> Suuuuubmisssion!
[1:51:41] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:51:41] <kaudera> holding A is scary face, pressing A is bulk up
[1:51:48] <VillainsLeague> the buff gives you a damage boost
[1:51:49] <xThomasWellertonx> support is a thing that exists guys
[1:51:49] <peachy996> I think 3D is better for Pokemon over 2D
[1:52:07] <kaudera> and the buff is just for your specials, not all the moves
[1:52:12] <Solidnick18> I remember that combo
[1:52:16] <Idon__> Yup, welcome to machamp fights
[1:52:16] <SomersaultJustice> My name is SEETTTHHHH
[1:52:17] <foxuzamaki> real combl
[1:52:19] <PFlare> That's not even 'styling'. That's just his BnB.
[1:52:20] <bazz_tv> i mean 2d as in gameplay not art style
[1:52:23] <Solidnick18> That was a great combo to do
[1:52:24] <SafCar009> we could just do group matches for the stream
[1:52:27] <Korgororo> this game has both 3d and 2d between phases
[1:52:27] <UnfilteredComic> Real combos
[1:52:35] <xThomasWellertonx> got your ass kicked
[1:52:38] <SafCar009> group matches are like online lobbies
[1:52:39] <peachy996> GIANT SWING
[1:52:53] <FuqBoiSlim> bodied
[1:52:54] <Korgororo> duel phase may as well be a 2d fighter
[1:52:55] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Reggie always gets destroyed online
[1:52:55] <peachy996> King would be proud
[1:53:07] <FuqBoiSlim> he stood no chance...
[1:53:11] <speximillian> Submission hurts so much...tbf everything Machamp does hurts so much. He has a ton of HP too, the highest in the game...?
[1:53:19] <Finaldragoon> SourPls
[1:53:20] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[1:53:23] <Chronomancer_Supreme> SourPls
[1:53:24] <speximillian> But he is slow and gets zoned out
[1:53:24] <VillainsLeague> when will the croagunk hero make an appearance becomes the real question
[1:53:25] <Solidnick18> oh snap
[1:53:27] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:53:27] <bazz_tv> stills feels more like an arena fighter to me, kinda like Anarchy Reigns but with restricted mobility at some phases
[1:53:31] <Idon__> badass character ruined by furries
[1:53:33] <xThomasWellertonx> time for some Kamehamehas
[1:53:35] <@Menitta> Ninetales is rad
[1:53:40] <+demegodz> this arena is a BOP
[1:53:46] <+Psycosis> Fox woolie
[1:53:47] <FuqBoiSlim> What's sourpls???
[1:53:48] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:53:48] <redrins> ninetales is a fox woolie
[1:53:50] <Dragon_Batman> Ninetails is awesome
[1:53:51] <+taggerung403> arcanine is the sickest fire type in gen 2
[1:53:52] <+Superbro64> good ol kurama
[1:53:52] <%Sparkseid> Reggie....
[1:53:53] <kaudera> yeah Machamp is in the highest hp tier along with Garchomp and Blastoise
[1:53:53] <+charmquarke> my preferred horse is scolipede
[1:53:55] <peachy996> Wow
[1:53:56] <Idon__> Alolan Ninetales is the BEST
[1:53:58] <AllTheZibas> i bet Woolie likes ninetails because naruto
[1:53:58] <+taggerung403> sorry gen 1
[1:53:58] <+Doc1790> lmfao
[1:53:58] <andrei11dr> I mean ,its no Houndoom
[1:53:59] <fuji_92> Reggie is pure
[1:53:59] <+nekodelic> Ninetails is a Karen
[1:54:02] <Palmtuna> This is coming from the dude you prefers Wortortle
[1:54:04] <MajoraZ> @bazz_tv it's certainly not: Each character has a unique movelist, there's a height system, just frames, cancels, etc
[1:54:04] <+Thatghostpepper> SourPls
[1:54:05] <@Solidus_113> Ninetails is Kuruma
[1:54:06] <peachy996> This stage is from Tekken Tag 2
[1:54:08] <FuqBoiSlim> @quarkee based
[1:54:09] <+Psycosis> Ninetails is just SSS Stylish
[1:54:09] <+Wool> did Woolie just call Ninetales a doggo horse
[1:54:18] <%winds_0f_change> aracanine line is better than either tho
[1:54:21] <+Doc1790> I also love Ninetails
[1:54:29] <Solidnick18> Come on machamp
[1:54:34] <Korgororo> pokken is what arena fighters wish they could be tbh
[1:54:34] <Solidnick18> ROCKS
[1:54:44] <@Menitta> Lucario's 4A is thicc
[1:54:47] <kaudera> @korgororo agreed
[1:54:51] <bazz_tv> so did Anarchy Reigns, I'm not saying the game isn't deep, I'm saying is not a traditional one
[1:54:51] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:54:53] <FuqBoiSlim> Alola ninetails> Kanto ninetails
[1:54:54] <Idon__> zoned
[1:54:55] <Solidnick18> lame ass reggie
[1:54:55] <+demegodz> LUL
[1:54:58] <speximillian> Lucario works pretty good for Reggie, he's used to playing Ryu
[1:55:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> who am i playing
[1:55:02] <Idon__> lame it out
[1:55:10] <PFlare> You can, with certain moves.
[1:55:13] <peachy996> Typical Naruto fan Woolie likes the Ninetails
[1:55:14] <+Doc1790> I forgot Mismagius was an assist
[1:55:16] <bazz_tv> never cared for Lucario's design
[1:55:21] <b_bakednomad_d> doodDood doodDood doodDood
[1:55:21] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah Lucario is reggie's Ryu
[1:55:32] <+Superbro64> does black mewtwo still have his infinite blockstring?
[1:55:37] <Korgororo> yeah its definetly an experimental game - but it turned out surprisingly solid
[1:55:44] <speximillian> This fight is just Ryu vs Zangief
[1:55:48] <@Menitta> "You're losing HP!" Thanks Nia....
[1:55:52] <peachy996> I think it's crazy Hitmonchan or Lee didn't make.
[1:55:52] <+Psycosis> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:55:56] <kaudera> you can combo after down X with down Y then forward A
[1:55:59] <@Solidus_113> all this meter
[1:56:00] <peachy996> Scizor is in this right?
[1:56:02] <xThomasWellertonx> nice punish
[1:56:06] <papertoonz1414> the game really needs a Pokken 2 in order to clean it up some more
[1:56:06] <Korgororo> yeah he is
[1:56:08] <kaudera> yeah Scizor is in
[1:56:10] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:56:11] <UnfilteredComic> THE CALL OUT
[1:56:13] <Solidnick18> YES
[1:56:13] <peachy996> Okay good
[1:56:13] <papertoonz1414> yes scizor is in
[1:56:13] <Idon__> LITERALLY blown the fuck up
[1:56:19] <@Menitta> Scizor is NUTS
[1:56:21] <papertoonz1414> his a mecha in this game
[1:56:25] <UnfilteredComic> Yall better use burst
[1:56:26] <FuqBoiSlim> which one is the boxer again? that would've been hype
[1:56:28] <bazz_tv> yeah when they announced I and a lot people thought it was going to play more like Tekken
[1:56:28] <kaudera> also the Hitmons are too dull lol
[1:56:30] <Idon__> Scizor is straight up a gundam
[1:56:30] <peachy996> I was gonna say if Scizor or Scyther aren't in that would b criminal
[1:56:31] <Solidnick18> YOO
[1:56:34] <@Menitta> Scizor plays like a gundam
[1:56:35] <Solidnick18> He ran at you
[1:56:36] <Dragon_Batman> Hitmonchan?
[1:56:37] <PFlare> Scizor literally has a Gundam reference.
[1:56:39] <kaudera> Hitmonchan is the boxer
[1:56:42] <+Superbro64> I severely doubt if there will be a pokken 2 honestly
[1:56:44] <Idon__> monchan is weirdly not in the game
[1:56:48] <xThomasWellertonx> S L U G
[1:56:50] <+Superbro64> But I've been suprised before
[1:56:58] <arkv01> like wing zero gundam or shining finger?
[1:57:04] <bazz_tv> can't they just keep adding characters?
[1:57:12] <Korgororo> they ignored a lot of fighting type Pokémon to make the game look more visually diverse and appealing
[1:57:14] <Idon__> Well they could if people still played this game lol
[1:57:18] <kaudera> they can but it's been 2 years since the dlc lol
[1:57:26] <FuqBoiSlim> hitmonchan would've been hype. it could have all 3 elemental punches as different swings. mega punch as its super
[1:57:27] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:57:27] <bazz_tv> oh

[2:01:15] <kaudera> @woolieversus a lot of the moves that seem like they have effects for no reason are because they references to how the moves work in the main pokemon games

[2:02:18] <coroquetz> overheat does double debuff chandy so if you miss it, you die
[2:02:25] <SomersaultJustice> it was a good match
[2:02:27] <+Psycosis> doin the harlem shake
[2:02:30] <speximillian> And then you use Mew and cancel the debuff

[2:04:10] <papertoonz1414> gib pokken 2
[2:04:12] <Dragon_Batman> It deserves a sequel
[2:04:13] <@Menitta> Pile is ACTUAL basic bitch
[2:04:15] <MajoraZ> The vs code is just "0". right?
[2:04:16] <SomersaultJustice> add Honchkrow
[2:04:18] <+Superbro64> developer support has ended then
[2:04:19] <Idon__> hggFeelspiccoloman
[2:04:23] <@Solidus_113> COME ON
[2:04:23] <speximillian> This game needs a new round of life, but it does still get play at Pokemon Reigonals and Nationals, with a proper prize pool.
[2:04:28] <+Psycosis> Halucha tho
[2:04:28] <@Solidus_113> DO THE PUNCH
[2:04:28] <SomersaultJustice> time for da gunk
[2:04:33] <Dragon_Batman> True
[2:04:34] <deafmelone> cant wait to get bodied!
[2:04:34] <speximillian> Crogunk Warrior is here!
[2:04:35] <papertoonz1414> do da punch
[2:04:37] <kaudera> LUL
[2:04:39] <VillainsLeague> Croagunk walks this Earth once again
[2:04:41] <andrei11dr> It think it sold really good tho
[2:04:42] <Idon__> Neither Bamco nor Pokemon company want nothing to do with this game
[2:04:42] <Solidnick18> CROGUNK YES
[2:04:44] <coroquetz> @WoolieVersus overheat is safe, but it stacks two debuffs and it's a mid so it can be jumped over, also she can't overheat again if she has any debuffs
[2:04:44] <papertoonz1414> let him do the punch
[2:04:46] <foxuzamaki> it sold pretty well on switch
[2:04:48] <laserbeaming> Do the Miguel Burla
[2:04:48] <+Superbro64> yeah, didnt think that pokken was a franchise that was to continue, honestly
[2:04:50] <thatjuantoo> GALCTICA PHANTOM?
[2:04:56] <Idon__> The troll character
[2:04:58] <sunnythedrunk> #13000
[2:04:58] <speximillian> So Crogunk is the Lethal Joke Character
[2:05:00] <SomersaultJustice> drop them Lv 9s!
[2:05:01] <TomFrancis_> melon of DEATH
[2:05:03] <PFlare> Game and Watch? I disagree with that.
[2:05:09] <Idon__> Basically the Yoshimitsu of the game
[2:05:12] <kingkeldeo31> Faust
[2:05:14] <papertoonz1414> crogunk is the random item character
[2:05:22] <PFlare> Faust is what I'd say.
[2:05:23] <+Psycosis> P
[2:05:26] <kaudera> I doubt either company wants "nothing" to do with the game since they bother to include it at Worlds
[2:05:29] <+marrs_bars> Who's the guest?
[2:05:29] <%OUTheTeam> pokemon company still holds tournaments for this so it isn't impossible @woolieversus
[2:05:32] <speximillian> Faust is a good comparison
[2:05:44] <bazz_tv> they got W101 out of the wiiu so hard that it became multiplatform
[2:05:44] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[2:05:45] <MajoraZ> @AceGamer0 is the vs code just "0", do you remember?
[2:05:54] <@Solidus_113> OHHHHHH
[2:05:55] <Idon__> LMAO
[2:05:56] <kaudera> don't know
[2:05:59] <andrei11dr> Man,i still haven't seen the grass owl, i want to see wat it does
[2:05:59] <Solidnick18> WHAT
[2:05:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> that fucking combos
[2:06:00] <papertoonz1414> YES
[2:06:01] <coroquetz> MIGUEL PUNCH
[2:06:01] <PFlare> YES
[2:06:03] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[2:06:05] <+CarlosEoM> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:06:09] <Solidnick18> YO HE GOT A MIGUEL PUNCH
[2:06:15] <Idon__> he even rubs his nose the exact same way LUL
[2:06:17] <Finaldragoon> Pikachu has the EWGF
[2:06:19] <peachy996> WAS THAT MIGUELS's PUNCH
[2:06:22] <laserbeaming> It's instakill I think
[2:06:23] <Dragon_Batman> I didn't know that
[2:06:26] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Why didnt this game selll?
[2:06:35] <foxuzamaki> I
[2:06:36] <laserbeaming> I don't know! It's awesome
[2:06:36] <speximillian> Overheat is not punishable on block
[2:06:40] <foxuzamaki> it did sell
[2:06:44] <bazz_tv> it was on the wiiu
[2:06:45] <peachy996> The slow walk followed by "hahahaha"
[2:06:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuuuck
[2:06:47] <Idon__> SALUTE

[2:06:50] <@Menitta> GG pile
[2:06:50] <+demegodz> o7
[2:06:54] <speximillian> Substitute Explosion
[2:06:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> GG menitta
[2:06:57] <arkv01> crokage
[2:06:58] <kaudera> @FrostedZaibatsu it did, just not many at tourneys
[2:07:01] <PFlare> Offer your soul.
[2:07:04] <%Irridium> I mean the switch version broke a million so that one at least sold well
[2:07:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> i cannot believe you can combo off of your fucking throw
[2:07:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> into super
[2:07:14] <MajoraZ> @FrostedZaibatsu I mean it did, it sold 1.3m units in like 8 months on both consoles. But it didn't get huge because it's stuck in a bad spot of being too competitive for casuals, but looking too much like an arena fighter for the fgc
[2:07:24] <@Menitta> Yeah Pikachu's forward throw can do that
[2:07:28] <Idon__> basically that
[2:07:33] <+CaptainPyron> Chandelure's adorable.
[2:07:35] <sunnythedrunk> OK croagunk looks sick
[2:07:35] <kaudera> Wii U reached 1.3 mill and Switch reached about 1.7 mill
[2:07:37] <@Solidus_113> I want that punch to hit
[2:07:39] <foxuzamaki> it sold over a million on both WiiU and switch and even sold more on switch despite being a port
[2:07:41] <Idon__> No casual's going to learn the phase points of every move lol
[2:07:42] <speximillian> Super Scaling is a big issue in this game if I recall
[2:07:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[2:07:44] <kaudera> for Pokken version sales
[2:07:48] <VillainsLeague> that Miguel punch has to land sometime though
[2:07:51] <BestTeaMaker> its the best arena fighter hands down
[2:07:55] <laserbeaming> Also Groagunk has an attack that improves vs debuffed opponents
[2:08:01] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:08:26] <laserbeaming> Blastoise is weird to play
[2:08:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'M MASHING TO GET INT

[2:19:36] <PFlare> @WoolieVersus Go to Advisor Settings to make her ACTUALLY vanish.
[2:19:40] <speximillian> If ya'll want a character to show up, buy the game and hop in the session
[2:19:44] <+ratearth> What sick fuck decided this game shouldn't have lobbies
[2:19:46] <arkv01> I think we needed an excel queue for this LUL
[2:19:46] <drefizz> wait what is this on? the switch?

[2:21:52] <@Solidus_113> Woolie has to rely on raw supers to win all his games
[2:22:05] <Idon__> Yeah burst doesn't stop after upser
[2:22:06] <Dragon_Batman> Can Woolie do this without the supers
[2:22:27] <BearSawed> Listen if it stupid but it works, it aint stupid
[2:22:29] <+demegodz> Woolie will crutch supers
[2:22:36] <PFlare> He's not just pressing buttons.
[2:22:40] <Idon__> Machamp hits you twice and wins
[2:22:46] <+Doc1790> This is Pikachu Mishima
[2:22:49] <@Menitta> GGs Woolie
[2:22:49] <Dragon_Batman> He really only gets super once a game tho
[2:22:50] <Solidnick18> too good
[2:22:57] <@Menitta> I talked shit and DID NOT get hit
[2:23:00] <speximillian> Machamp is strong but if he can't hit you, he can't beat you

[2:24:02] <+Wool> FUCK
[2:24:03] <Idon__> This guy is super complex
[2:24:03] <speximillian> Trap the opponent in a Nightmare
[2:24:05] <drefizz> Reggie always goes for the hype
[2:24:06] <laserbeaming> Darkrai is very hard to play
[2:24:06] <+Wool> I'M TRYING SO HARD
[2:24:11] <Idon__> Literally send em to the shadow realm
[2:24:14] <empanadadejq> pishima? mikachu?
[2:24:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHY can i get everyone else but woolie
[2:24:33] <CPTCarbine> Yeah when Darkrai snowballs, he is out of control.

[2:25:32] <Idon__> oh shit a weavile
[2:25:32] <deafmelone> yeah ill wait
[2:25:33] <bazz_tv> are those psycho crushers
[2:25:35] <Idon__> HE'S RANK A5
[2:25:36] <Idon__> it's over
[2:25:37] <+Holo_vOiD> yoo majoraz
[2:25:39] <drefizz> my favorite ice pokemon
[2:25:40] <papertoonz1414> it's over
[2:25:41] <+demegodz> ITS OVER
[2:25:43] <BestTeaMaker> rip
[2:25:44] <laserbeaming> Weavile is sick
[2:25:48] <Idon__> NotLikeThis
[2:25:50] <speximillian> Weavile is mass rushdown. Bad matchup vs Darkrai....
[2:25:50] <Dragon_Batman> With a Weavile too
[2:25:50] <PFlare> Weavile's too cool.
[2:25:54] <+Holo_vOiD> show them the weav!!! PokWeavile PokWeavile
[2:25:59] <@Menitta> Oh fuck
[2:26:05] <@Menitta> This person is goooood
[2:26:10] <speximillian> Majora's a pro, yeh
[2:26:27] <Infinit_Phoenix> all my favorite pokemon are in this
[2:26:33] <PFlare> He might get randomed out, though.
[2:26:36] <CPTCarbine> Weavile is very fast and likes to pressure with his offense.
[2:26:38] <papertoonz1414> iceical crash
[2:26:54] <arkv01> nANDE?
[2:26:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:26:59] <papertoonz1414> the legs
[2:27:03] <speximillian> Weavile's other gimmick is that a lot of his moves Knock Off your Synergy meter
[2:27:10] <Idon__> TRAPS
[2:27:11] <GeltonZ> Oh GEEZE! I didn't have "Use VS Code" on!
[2:27:26] <bazz_tv> cross ups don't matter with block buttons, just a nrs player
[2:27:28] <Fdrank> its on phase changes
[2:27:31] <anarchistPastry> !uptime
[2:27:32] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 36 minutes
[2:27:35] <kaudera> Krais hold a can heal gray hp
[2:27:37] <laserbeaming> If you force a phase change you get some life back. You also regain it on Burst @WoolieVersus
[2:27:37] <UnfilteredComic> Phase Shift restores life if you trigger it
[2:27:38] <+ratearth> this game pisses me off lol
[2:27:40] <Fdrank> when you win field you get heath back
[2:27:44] <+Jackeral> Gg @captainpiledriver
[2:27:54] <+Holo_vOiD> all characters heal when they win the field phase
[2:27:58] <+Holo_vOiD> or are in burst
[2:28:07] <kaudera> phase shift from field to duel also heals gray hp
[2:28:09] <Fdrank> win field or use burst
[2:28:10] <+ratearth> So many bad design decisions for playability tbh, like no lobbies
[2:28:27] <@Menitta> Darkrai is a character that I'm just glad got in this game because no doubt Darkrai would have a wack ass moveset
[2:28:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Jackeral gg
[2:28:37] <kaudera> there's lobbies sort of but they're not great
[2:28:44] <NeroInfinite> disco world
[2:28:48] <UnfilteredComic> CS missing textures lookin ass
[2:29:01] <Idon__> killed before the cutscene
[2:29:05] <bazz_tv> was that a dance floor?
[2:29:09] <+demegodz> Peaces out
[2:29:10] <PFlare> lol Darkrai just dipped.
[2:29:14] <sunnythedrunk> Darkrai's like fuck this
[2:29:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHY
[2:29:18] <Idon__> I'm OUT
[2:29:20] <arkv01> peaces out and leaves a YOU DIDNT WIN shadow message
[2:29:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> god damnit
[2:29:22] <@Menitta> that was a missing texture in Source engine
[2:29:32] <peachy996> That's a cool way to lose
[2:29:34] <Idon__> "I'm OUT
[2:29:41] <speximillian> I kinda wanna see Majora vs guess
[2:29:42] <Idon__> Easy Mode is now Selectable
[2:29:43] <PFlare> I love this stage.
[2:29:44] <speximillian> Guest*
[2:29:47] <deafmelone> I remember Darkrai has some Lee chaolan moves in here
[2:29:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm done fighting "chill"
[2:29:55] <+Wool> WHO IS HI WOOLIE :D
[2:30:00] <%Irridium> sbfpDattebayo
[2:30:08] <kingkeldeo31> I think nightmare mode on this stage looks really cool
[2:30:10] <drefizz> Wait
[2:30:21] <drefizz> is Weavile doing the sonic adventure 1 run
[2:30:23] <Idon__> weavile NEVER stops
[2:30:23] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:30:26] <PFlare> He doesn't.
[2:30:28] <Dragon_Batman> Wow Darkrai melts
[2:30:32] <drefizz> the same run that naruto stole from sonic
[2:30:36] <UnfilteredComic> When he charges up, you can just hit him
[2:30:38] <PFlare> That's how Weavile plays.
[2:30:38] <Solidnick18> never
[2:30:41] <Idon__> suggested: Blocking
[2:30:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> you know chill
[2:30:47] <%Irridium> what you makes you think you get a turn?
[2:30:55] <fuji_92> weavile is the epitome of never stops going in
[2:30:56] <bazz_tv> berserker barrage your ass
[2:30:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> you've got like 2 sets in
[2:30:59] <drefizz> she is f'ing you up
[2:31:06] <@Solidus_113> SUUUUUUUUUUUPER DAAAAAASHHHH
[2:31:18] <Idon__> yeah this is probably the WORST possible outcome
[2:31:20] <PFlare> Weavile has a built in 'keeping my turn' mechanic with Fake Out.
[2:31:38] <kaudera> yeah fake out is like +8 lol
[2:31:47] <speximillian> Fake Out's quite fast
[2:31:58] <@Menitta> What sucks though is if you have a bad match, netcode wise, against a Weavile, you might as well just give up lol
[2:31:59] <Idon__> "I don't even NEED this block or grab button"
[2:32:01] <NeroInfinite> You get no turns
[2:32:01] <+demegodz> Oppessive
[2:32:05] <arkv01> +8? holy shit thats fucked
[2:32:10] <coroquetz> that's nothing
[2:32:12] <CPTCarbine> Like I said, the offensive pressure.
[2:32:14] <PFlare> No, like 90% of it is real.
[2:32:17] <coroquetz> enhanced libre's 8A is +16
[2:32:24] <MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus weavile's grab is veryt low damage
[2:32:25] <andrei11dr> That was free as fuck
[2:32:35] <empanadadejq> he be breathing down yo neck, making you wait till he decides to end you
[2:32:44] <kaudera> well the fastest moves in the game are frame 11 so it's not as bad then
[2:32:51] <Finaldragoon> SourPls
[2:32:51] <bazz_tv> not enough super armor maybe
[2:32:54] <MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus also weaviles grab is low range as fuck, it's npot worthy other then as a mixup vs contuining block pressure
[2:33:05] <kaudera> switching from field to duel is what heals gray hp @WoolieVersus
[2:33:06] <Finaldragoon> JAM ALERT
[2:33:20] <speximillian> pro vs pro here, let's go
[2:33:25] <Idon__> Rushdown vs zoner, a tale as old as time
[2:33:30] <@Menitta> God this stage
[2:33:33] <laserbeaming> Weavile is super cute, that's more than enough for me
[2:33:35] <@Menitta> Fuckin slaps
[2:33:39] <speximillian> This music tho
[2:33:53] <kaudera> Pokken music Kreygasm
[2:33:54] <speximillian> Neos City X Space Jam is a bop

[2:34:51] <@Menitta> Oh yeah Espeon would be good with Chandelure
[2:34:53] <kaudera> heals hp based on how much time is left in the round
[2:35:05] <@Menitta> Umbreon is a "get the fuck away" tool
[2:35:06] <peachy996> Wait Weavile did a Blonde Bomb?
[2:35:11] <+Vylent_> the sounds are so esaAYAYA
[2:35:12] <@Solidus_113> Braixen did one year

[2:35:26] <deafmelone> @peachy996 as its throw
[2:35:38] <peachy996> Alright Weavile makes sense now if it has Nina's move
[2:35:45] <PFlare> Umbreon is a Burst.
[2:35:46] <@Menitta> "Jump"

[2:36:11] <@Solidus_113> This is Majora's 4th
[2:36:12] <%Irridium> like the fourth time LUL
[2:36:15] <GeltonZ> Yeah you've rematched 4 times :P
[2:36:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> this mofo has gotten a lot

[2:36:48] <GeltonZ> Yeah I'm gonna use Braixen
[2:36:56] <bazz_tv> pros get more plays so its fine
[2:37:02] <GeltonZ> But OOF do I fear Chandelure.
[2:37:11] <@Menitta> Chandelure has a lot of self debuffs too right?
[2:37:19] <%Irridium> minimize LUL
[2:37:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> @bazz_tv pros doesn't matter here, everybody get's matches is the point or at least they try to
[2:37:25] <coroquetz> only overheat self debuffs
[2:37:31] <kaudera> lowest hp is 480 and highest is 660
[2:37:33] <coroquetz> she can apply a lot of debuffs to the opponent
[2:37:40] <@Menitta> Ok just overheat
[2:37:51] <Solidnick18> wtf
[2:37:55] <@Solidus_113> CLOSE
[2:37:57] <@Menitta> THREE
[2:37:57] <CPTCarbine> DOwn to the wire!
[2:38:02] <drefizz> this game is kinda cooler than Tekken
[2:38:04] <Idon__> look ma, I can zone too
[2:38:09] <+jiggy_snipe> OOO
[2:38:09] <coroquetz> smog is def down, will o wisp is atk down, burst attack is defense/speed down
[2:38:10] <Solidnick18> HE WON
[2:38:10] <@Menitta> CLOCK
[2:38:15] <PFlare> TIMER SCAM
[2:38:17] <Idon__> "TASTE YOUR OWN MEDICINE"
[2:38:24] <drefizz> thanks obama
[2:38:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> who ever has lower health and you both have 1 hp, the person whose character naturally has lower health always wins
[2:38:35] <kaudera> time wins are percentage based
[2:38:36] <@Menitta> Last time I tried to timer scam I fuckin lost so I dont do that lol
[2:38:50] <bazz_tv> like good ol cross Tekken
[2:38:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> timer scam in this game is bullshit
[2:39:07] <@Menitta> Shadow Mewtwo is glass as FUCK
[2:39:10] <Idon__> Shadow Mewtwo is straight BS, but he's got low HP and he takes his own HP for attacks
[2:39:10] <UnfilteredComic> Shadow mewtwo is fucking nuts
[2:39:15] <drefizz> I love that weavile runs like sonic
[2:39:18] <speximillian> This is a real-ass match
[2:39:21] <Idon__> Basically smash Pichu lol
[2:39:30] <+Holo_vOiD> shadow mewtwo has all the perfect tools of a fighting game character
[2:39:31] <@Menitta> You should actually pick Shadow Mewtwo one match
[2:39:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> shadow mewtwo has full vertical beams
[2:39:40] <+Doc1790> Shadow Mewtwo has my favorite Super in the game. Cuz it's just Budokai 3.
[2:39:52] <CPTCarbine> Shadow Mewtwo is ridiculous but, I prefer regular Mewtwo better.
[2:39:53] <@Menitta> Yeah thats JUST Frieza on Namek
[2:39:54] <Idon__> Frieza vibes
[2:39:56] <@Menitta> Its sick
[2:40:04] <speximillian> Shadow Mewtwo just has Cell's Spirit Bomb
[2:40:07] <Idon__> Regular Mewtwo got a straight kamehameha
[2:40:16] <YakumoYomi> Was it Shadow Mewtwo or regular that has the grab super?
[2:40:21] <Idon__> Regular
[2:40:32] <@Menitta> this match is sick

[2:47:58] <Idon__> Dragon: Slain
[2:47:58] <CPTCarbine> Good Games
[2:47:58] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:48:03] <%OUTheTeam> 5 star gameplay
[2:48:10] <+Wool> bruh it's so hard getting matched :'(

[2:48:30] <Solidnick18> you will get it wool have faith
[2:48:32] <CPTCarbine> I'm surprised that special did not reach!
[2:48:39] <%Irridium> @Wool same I keep getting killers it's rough out here
[2:48:42] <bear_breaker20> @SafCar009 k cool i might get into it , this game gives me a battle revolutions vibe ive been missing
[2:48:46] <SafCar009> Lmao "HiWoolie:D"
[2:48:47] <peachy996> Oh yeah his second hit
[2:48:51] <Darthkitten_Prime> Have they fought a Scizor yet?
[2:48:52] <@Solidus_113> Bryan Fury time
[2:49:08] <zenith0111> HOLD THAT L
[2:49:14] <Solidnick18> no @Darthkitten_Prime
[2:49:24] <MajoraZ> @bear_breaker20 it's a great game, but like any other fighting game you;ll get out of it what you put in. The main place all the resources are at is the main community discord server which is just discord DOT gg SLASH pokken
[2:49:36] <%tearfuldevil> this music boppin
[2:49:39] <+Virtual_Rays> Bryan Fury Garchomp
[2:49:48] <zenith0111> stickm12Uhh stickm12Uhh stickm12Uhh stickm12Uhh stickm12Uhh
[2:50:03] <CPTCarbine> Garchomp, hits very hard has good combo setups and loves dive underground with Dig.
[2:50:11] <Solidnick18> Stupid storm outside FeelsBadMan
[2:50:17] <Idon__> Garchomp's real strength is putting you in the sandstorm blender
[2:50:17] <MajoraZ> @tearknack also yeah the whole Pokken soundtrack is amazing. Magikarp Festival gets all the hype but Tellur Town Autumn, Blue Dome, and Neos City Night slap just as hard
[2:50:31] <MajoraZ> garchomp is corner mixups: the character
[2:50:57] <zenith0111> WHAT A CRAZY SUPER
[2:51:02] <@Menitta> Garchomp is the LEAST UNDERRATED pokemon
[2:51:21] <bear_breaker20> i have given this game no attention and even i remember that magikarp song being dope lol @MajoraZ
[2:51:25] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:51:27] <zenith0111> YO
[2:51:35] <Idon__> Only thing Garchomp doesn't have is a smash invite lol
[2:51:39] <xThomasWellertonx> the comeback though
[2:51:41] <Idon__> other than that he's pretty damn popular
[2:51:46] <+jiggy_snipe> that was different
[2:51:46] <MajoraZ> @bear_breaker20 give the rest of the music a try too, as I said: those 3 songs I mentioned are even better/just as good
[2:51:46] <sunnythedrunk> that was such a choke
[2:51:52] <+scrublordmyo> is there still a big community for this game?
[2:52:03] <CPTCarbine> Sandstorm combo was nice.
[2:52:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> PERFECY
[2:52:07] <+jiggy_snipe> P
[2:52:07] <kaudera> decently sized community yeah

[2:52:10] <%Irridium> bodied
[2:52:13] <+jiggy_snipe> YOOOO Cap
[2:52:14] <+Virtual_Rays> Garchomp is unabashedly just Bryan Fury

[2:52:52] <@Menitta> Pick Gardevoir
[2:53:01] <@Solidus_113> woolieMIRIN
[2:53:02] <MajoraZ> @scrublordmyo not giant, but we still have players for sure. We still get some majors/regionals and a number of places still have locals, we have online weeklies on the community discord server, and you can get mathces on ranked, but it's certainly a smaller scene then some other games
[2:53:04] <zenith0111> calebSM
[2:53:08] <sunnythedrunk> LOOL TELL EM WOOL

[2:57:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggiegigas is cool but then you try to use him and he fucking has slow start which cuts his attack and defense in half for like, what, 3-5 turns?
[2:57:46] <Idon__> you know you're fucked when the ora turns rainbow colored
[2:57:55] <sunnythedrunk> Slow Start ruined Regigigas for everyone
[2:58:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> it was only made for him
[2:58:13] <Idon__> Machamp doesn't believe in "being in the lead" he believes in dead or not dead
[2:58:20] <papertoonz1414> good thing galarian weezing is a thing now

[3:02:30] <+Take_2_shots> Why didn't they have Nidorino so you could do the Nidorino Vs Gengar intro to Pokemon Title Gen 1?
[3:02:33] <@Menitta> @Wool You're right. RAIKOU NEVER GOT A MOVIE
[3:02:39] <+Jackeral> learning so much with these sets
[3:02:40] <+Wool> BECAUSE RAIKOU SUCKS
[3:02:40] <zenith0111> LUL

[3:03:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Wool you're right
[3:03:33] <sunnythedrunk> Entei movie was weird af
[3:03:33] <@Solidus_113> You're the same people who like Pearl more than Marina in Splatoon 2
