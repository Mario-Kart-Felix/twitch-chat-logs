[0:25:20] <silverback129> sonicfox
[0:25:23] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus Throw out guard cancels the second you block something, nobody is baiting those yet
[0:25:24] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Did Sonicfox win tho

[0:25:55] <%Sulliman34> woolie, the man who will NEVER CONVERT FROM 2M
[0:25:58] <shryoc> S
[0:25:58] <Parapattern> Woolie, when are you gonna invite SonicFox to the stream? Kappa
[0:26:11] <Second_Omega> I’m quite confident in my speed you know
[0:26:11] <spawnzie> Jiren has the biggest turn to use the Xbox
[0:26:13] <Obassassinater> I see Hit I approve SeemsGood
[0:26:13] <+LordAlroy> hello farewell
[0:26:13] <+SvenHolgersson> HELLO FAREWELL
[0:26:16] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Whats a Jiren
[0:26:18] <SomersaultJustice> I have no money
[0:26:20] <CerberusDriver> woolie would prolly beat sonicfox
[0:26:20] <Sphincter_Spelunker> His number is so big
[0:26:20] <+tk_toodank> el hermano is hella sick
[0:26:21] <SomersaultJustice> to buy jiren
[0:26:21] <horton_hears_you> Jiren is so fun
[0:26:23] <+Haarute> Pat liked Jiren.
[0:26:25] <%Sulliman34> woolie should NOT be keeping hit as his anchor
[0:26:25] <exalt4747> I've been playing Jiren but I'm not like, good at fgs.
[0:26:26] <MyNameIsRasus> He's the best ojou
[0:26:27] <mercado94> Jiren is fine. not as fun as videl
[0:26:28] <KeiPrime> whats bigger jiren's number or an original xbox
[0:26:32] <horton_hears_you> I love all his options
[0:26:32] <NarcissistCactus> jiren has good neutral I heard
[0:26:34] <mojomoud> I just paid rent for the month, so no Jiren for me right now
[0:26:35] <+Irridium> Jiren's fuckin' dope. In a dramatic departure from his character his moveset is actual interesting
[0:26:37] <exalt4747> I've been learning a couple of combos, getting better at the combos
[0:26:37] <%Solidnick18> apatDab
[0:26:38] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> when I had the game installed I just tried Videl, she's got some fun combos
[0:26:39] <rad_dude123465> Jiren and his Counters are Hype as fuck dude
[0:26:40] <Second_Omega> Still weaker than Sha’gi
[0:26:43] <Ethel9727> Jiren is fun but Videl is soooo awesome
[0:26:44] <TheBrunoZone> @WoolieVersus I like him actually, not more than videl, but he's fun
[0:26:47] <+OceanGovernor> Jiren is stronger than even Twitch Prime
[0:26:49] <FackinCrazy> Jiren should have been shirless
[0:26:49] <+Stratiotai2> woolie should be blowing shit up with hit
[0:26:50] <+KENTASHIRO> Jiren is pretty different, but I like him a lot. Videl is a lot more fun for sure
[0:26:56] <gamerphil07> Jiren is really fun but I’m a casual so I dunno what I’m talking about
[0:26:56] <paridisco> Jiren good in the game in the anime he's trash
[0:27:00] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:27:01] <xiccy> Frieza Hit and Broly
[0:27:01] <mcchase58> Jiren is the counter god
[0:27:03] <+LordAlroy> is this a work? Is Woolie only good with Hit?
[0:27:04] <+Haarute> Another 1v3 Hit comeback let's go.
[0:27:04] <exalt4747> I've been playing both Jiren and Videl.

[0:31:23] <NarcissistCactus> base goku isn't one of the worst when frieza and beerus exist
[0:31:27] <Mattmandx1> The Shenron mechanic was just a bad idea
[0:31:28] <GiveMoneyToVolta> Pausing will result in disqualification

[0:34:26] <CheekyBirb> instead this is team Shadow, Rouge and Omega
[0:34:26] <+kotokaname> Cheer2thoughts on KH3 o3o?
[0:34:27] <%UrsulaCat> I hope Woolie meets Volta
[0:34:28] <+PeaceCentennial> depends on whatever the "premium" Titanfall project is
[0:34:31] <kresnikhama> oi m8
[0:34:33] <Swish19XX> Gokugokugoku dot com is amazing
[0:34:38] <keiji_maede> Damn
[0:34:39] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> Hey Woolie, Any chance of a Titanfall night?
[0:34:41] <$kotokaname> cheer2 thoughts on KH3 o3o?
[0:34:42] <+PeaceCentennial> They should at least make Titanfall 2 Free to play
[0:34:43] <CerberusDriver> a Premium Titanfall experience could mean anything, even a mobile game so Im not holding my breath
[0:34:44] <+SvenHolgersson> PS4?
[0:34:44] <+Dewitt1998> My dreams of fighting woolie are coming to fruition
[0:34:45] <mercado94> GOOD. But I need to get good at the game first
[0:34:47] <SumKnowBuddy> @WoolieVersus who's on the couch with you?
[0:34:47] <Governor_Explosion> @WoolieVersus Were you playing 7SU because there's a lot of fanfiction of it?

[0:34:49] <+Dewitt1998> TONIGHT
[0:34:50] <+chaos5338> @woolieversus i loved your mvc3 intro for Fisticuffs
[0:34:51] <drefizz> @WoolieVersus will you try out the Jojo BR game if it hits console and pc?
[0:34:54] <autismtank> @WoolieVersus I was just watching Pat's DBFZ vod and he couldn't figure out Goku's kaioken super. How does it work with mashing buttons or something?
[0:34:55] <%Menitta> Right now theres server maintenance so hopefully that ends soon.
[0:34:55] <spawnzie> The shading on Jiren looks so wierd
[0:35:00] <reiju_22> @Swish19XX all systems goku Kreygasm
[0:35:04] <sunny_side_up> i could watch labbing for hours ngl
[0:35:04] <SpaciestWand> labing is sick wtf woolie
[0:35:08] <$MisterArcanine> I want the girl saiyans as dlc so bad
[0:35:11] <+PeaceCentennial> Apex doing good hurts my heart but hopefully this just empowers Respawn
[0:35:11] <%jinking79> i know my lvl in this game i will lose a lot here
[0:35:17] <sunny_side_up> i used to watch max's 8+ hour labbing vods LUL

[0:35:24] <Ethel9727> So are you only on PS4? BibleThump
[0:35:24] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus Somebody tell Reggie Jiren's air combos use S instead of 2H
[0:35:31] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Labbing is not Boring! doodBigBrain woolieOMG @woolieversus
[0:35:31] <$Chatterbox1991> Woolie thought you should know Fallout 1 and 2 are 7 dollars on Steam right now; you said you were interested so thought you might wanna know :)
[0:35:32] <%GohanEgret> Nasthony
[0:35:32] <Fluxraw> Anthony: "Leave Jiren to me."
[0:35:33] <%CEGold> Any tips for a fighting game noob (me) to get better? Should I try a stick or stick to controller?
[0:35:34] <%Skullgod> Dirty PogChamp Tony PogChamp
[0:35:35] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Lol
[0:35:36] <%Solidnick18> He's a nice guy
[0:35:37] <Vashido22> Jiren can super dash after j.S
[0:35:37] <spardanwarrior> @autismtank IIRC it's based on how many dead teammates you have.
[0:35:38] <$MisterArcanine> Like let me throw money
[0:35:39] <Swish19XX> @reiju_22 The only anime podcast
[0:35:39] <DynoGems> Yo @WoolieVersus was nice running into ya at the MK11 event. Sorry it was raining =)
[0:35:42] <+PeaceCentennial> This is on PS4, right?
[0:35:42] <+yoshkosh20> anthony the type of man you can bring home to mama?
[0:35:45] <+pkmamsters> VIOLENT TONY
[0:35:46] <ElenaManetta> These intro animations are always so cool to look at
[0:35:52] <exalt4747> New Vegas is also cheap af on steam rn
[0:35:52] <+Jordan_z123> Anthony jirentano here
[0:35:57] <Sandro2584> DIRTY GORY TONY
[0:36:02] <horton_hears_you> Never use 2h with jiren
[0:36:04] <+Kaito_Cam> @PeaceCentennial like is it available on Ps4 or are they playing Ps4?
[0:36:04] <investorscratchit> There is server maintenance going on right now @WoolieVersus
[0:36:05] <Hazard_Kujacker> Wait he can be Kurt Angle!?
[0:36:06] <NarcissistCactus> S superdash
[0:36:07] <BalloniWright> @sphincter_spelunker everyone in the chat was asking about Shaggy reveal cuz Ed Boon posted a Shaggy joke on twitter
[0:36:07] <FackinCrazy> DIRTY TONY! clap clap. . .clap clap clap
[0:36:08] <ElenaManetta> It's always nice to see even in CG that you can do really cool foreshortening animations in just a few "poses" or drawings or however you want to translate it
[0:36:09] <blackjackskellington> Hey, it’s 18. ALLEGEDLY
[0:36:12] <nobknee> GokuGokuGoku@Goku.Goku
[0:36:13] <horton_hears_you> only use 5s/2s
[0:36:15] <gatorafan> Wholesome Hentai Artist Tony Kappa
[0:36:15] <NarcissistCactus> 2H combos in the corner after S
[0:36:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Randyyyyyyyyyyyy
[0:36:17] <+PeaceCentennial> @Kaito_Cam oh sorry, are they playing on PS4
[0:36:21] <ECRead> Jiren in general likes 2S more than 2H
[0:36:24] <+PeaceCentennial> because I want to play but I have it on PC
[0:36:32] <+HallowedGuru> Jiren's air 2H is a dive and his standing H is a command grab
[0:36:35] <spardanwarrior> @WoolieVersus Jiren's 2H tosses them behind you, 2S is a standard launcher
[0:36:36] <NovaKnightmare> English Cell makes the dub worth it
[0:36:37] <+Kaito_Cam> @PeaceCentennial I think so one of them is holding a ps4 controller
[0:36:43] <TheBrunoZone> @spardanwarrior That's only for the amount of hits you can use. 3 if you have the 3 chars, 5 if you have 2, and 10 if you have only 1
[0:36:46] <DrkJP520> ENG cell sounds too goofy
[0:36:47] <horton_hears_you> only use 2h on ground if you need side switch
[0:36:50] <+PeaceCentennial> ah ok, thanks @Kaito_Cam
[0:36:51] <kresnikhama> WE GOT THOSE
[0:36:52] <DynoGems> I thought Goku (Base) was trash?
[0:36:53] <+SvenHolgersson> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:36:58] <Second_Omega> Canadian combos
[0:37:00] <Sandro2584> Is Dirty tony dirtier than filthy tom
[0:37:00] <spawnzie> I also like the wierd noises Cooler makes in english
[0:37:00] <%Ion_LaserX> Nice
[0:37:00] <%GohanEgret> REGGIE PLS
[0:37:02] <+PeaceCentennial> @WoolieVersus Nah it's cool, that's just what happens sometimes
[0:37:02] <+SvenHolgersson> LAST TICK
[0:37:03] <EMP_SaltyMan> Yo the call out
[0:37:04] <%CEGold> The very last hit PogChamp
[0:37:06] <Datwiseguy> FILTHY TONY
[0:37:06] <NeonBleu> RAW
[0:37:08] <exalt4747> Cell is one of the few characters that I think I prefer in JP
[0:37:09] <+Haarute> Raw lvl3 beats anything.
[0:37:10] <+Kaito_Cam> Who do you think will get the Toriyama treatment next i'm kind of hoping for Janemba
[0:37:11] <IminyourBase> THE RAWEST SUPER
[0:37:14] <Ethel9727> Well the one good thing about me being only on PC is that I won't get my ass kicked by Woolie on stream
[0:37:15] <+mechslayer71> Isn’t there crossplay with PC
[0:37:17] <Oh_Gee_Man> Awe snap, the RAW lv3
[0:37:23] <Malik1002> I turn my back and know yall play fighterz
[0:37:24] <+PeaceCentennial> I don't think it has crossplay
[0:37:24] <%Solidnick18> some dirt
[0:37:25] <+chaos5338> Woolie didn't get that respect how
[0:37:26] <extradopeness> Hardest of reads
[0:37:27] <+SvenHolgersson> BITCH I WILL EAT YOU- Cell
[0:37:28] <RadShiro> IF THE RAW SUPER HITS, ITS NOT DISRESPECT. JUST CALCULATED Kappa
[0:37:30] <NarcissistCactus> base goku isn't the worst
[0:37:43] <Second_Omega> D I R T
[0:37:43] <+SvenHolgersson> Naw 17 is
[0:37:45] <+TintainiumCan> So it's raw it was blue
[0:37:46] <DynoGems> No crossplay. Especially w / ps4
[0:37:47] <KeiPrime> sfv is the only fighting game i know of that has pc to ps4 cross play
[0:37:49] <Vashido22> base goku is bottom 3 tho
[0:37:52] <CerberusDriver> that super was so raw, it still had blood in it
[0:37:54] <Vashido22> 17 is the WORST
[0:37:58] <Oh_Gee_Man> As a casual, I know to be afraid when someone can competently play 18
[0:38:08] <djbrooks603> When's TFS voice pack? Kappa
[0:38:10] <reiju_22> look at him :(
[0:38:18] <Sambin0> woolie watch DBS, the tournement of power is amazing
[0:38:21] <+Ell1ot> Don't shoot!
[0:38:24] <+SvenHolgersson> Just wait for the GUYSHUR
[0:38:25] <%Menitta> DBS is a fun watch
[0:38:26] <+ArgCooper> Just tuning in. Who's on which side?
[0:38:31] <EMP_SaltyMan> Man jiren plays like a weirdo
[0:38:33] <DrkJP520> Woolie fake Norio Wakamoto fan.
[0:38:36] <+sunnythedrunk> Hit>>>Jiren
[0:38:41] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @BalloniWright Right right. I remember now. So just Max doing damage control? Really just draws more attention to it if he's purging his comments of it.
[0:38:42] <drefizz> They are heavily different in the Goku black arc
[0:38:44] <rufus2k2> a TON of things are different, Kefla don't even sniff Goku in the manga
[0:38:47] <Subversity777> The manga is really split from the anime
[0:38:47] <kotokaname> cheer5 This Jiren DOESN'T GO SHIRTLESS though.
[0:38:51] <YeezusPieces1> GT > Super come at me
[0:38:51] <+SvenHolgersson> Jiren is like a GT villain made canon
[0:38:56] <%VonB0lt> Tournament of Power is like 10 minutes in the manga, its incredibly funny.
[0:38:56] <%GohanEgret> @ArgCooper anthony is p1, reggie is p2
[0:39:05] <gatorafan> Woolie Vs Dragon Ball Super: BACK IN
[0:39:10] <Second_Omega> Hit is much better than most other things in super
[0:39:11] <+GrayFox621> servers down for maintenance!? I'm in New York can someone confirm this?!
[0:39:12] <+HallowedGuru> Hit is really cool
[0:39:14] <+ArgCooper> Thanks!
[0:39:17] <rufus2k2> Dyspo got done dirty in the manga
[0:39:19] <+broly_bear> Ya where is Shirtless Jiren?
[0:39:21] <exalt4747> Hit's design is okay but like
[0:39:21] <%Menitta> @VonB0lt Yeah in the anime its 30 minutes Kappa
[0:39:22] <NarcissistCactus> servers went down earlier
[0:39:22] <+Kaito_Cam> Hit likes making the doughnuts
[0:39:24] <%GohanEgret> \o/
[0:39:25] <+jayfigga> I didn’t think the ToP arc was that bad.
[0:39:26] <+PeaceCentennial> I mean Hit is way cooler, that's not even fair
[0:39:28] <exalt4747> I don't get why he's used as a comparison
[0:39:31] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Hit is waaaa too cool
[0:39:31] <Mucmaster> The manga and anime essentially cover the same story beats, but how they happen is quite different
[0:39:32] <Sandro2584> Hit is the best new addition to dragon ball
[0:39:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jiren isn't even as interesting as freizas henchmen
[0:39:39] <+PeaceCentennial> Hit is one of the coolest DB characters in general
[0:39:43] <+mechslayer71> Jiren is literally the grey alien emoji but buff mwoolieversus
[0:39:44] <+Kaito_Cam> Ki KO HOOOO!!!!
[0:39:47] <CheekyBirb> considering jiren is a jobber personality edgelord, hit being the better character in general is just no brainer
[0:39:54] <+SvenHolgersson> Thats super cool Tien deserves something man
[0:40:07] <kresnikhama> BIG BRAIN
[0:40:09] <+Haarute> REGGIE.
[0:40:10] <+Kaito_Cam> @SvenHolgersson Tien puts in work 100% of the time
[0:40:10] <+mechslayer71> Jiren is just the grey alien emoji but buff @woolieversus
[0:40:11] <MyNameIsRasus> FUCK POWER LEVELS
[0:40:11] <$MisterArcanine> Super is fighting tourney anime gone super saiyan

[0:40:35] <%Order_of_Mystery> cell saying 'hello' is hilarious to me, he sounds like a creeper
[0:40:36] <+SvenHolgersson> @Kaito_Cam Yet he's still weaker than Krillin who quite fighting to be a fucking cop smdh
[0:40:37] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Tien was a REALLY solid anchor back in the day

[1:00:45] <ECRead> what was that, Necalli main? Kappa
[1:00:47] <Lysdexic9541> @woolieversus 2 because you save the best for last
[1:00:49] <TheBrunoZone> @WoolieVersus 5LLL is actually a command grab
[1:00:50] <%GohanEgret> Pat labbed by beating up Fuggins Kappa
[1:00:56] <+HallowedGuru> You can super dash after her level 1 @WoolieVersus
[1:00:56] <Vashido22> @woolieversus try 4MM
[1:01:02] <Limes528> @WoolieVersus You can superdash immediately after her level 1
[1:01:25] <Governor_Explosion> What do I do if I want to get more into fighting games but I grew up a buttonmasher who ignored tournaments
[1:01:31] <+ArgCooper> Did Pat lose even once to Fuggins?
[1:01:34] <TigerClaws12> she's STYLISH
[1:01:40] <%GohanEgret> I think he went like 30 - 0
[1:01:41] <%Ion_LaserX> @ArgCooper Nope
[1:01:43] <jonathandemel> @ArgCooper Nope
[1:01:50] <+mechslayer71> 30-0
[1:01:51] <+tomokocchi_> Videl is just plain FUN
[1:01:53] <+Graem> I don't think I have hand dexterity required for fighting games but I still try.
[1:01:57] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus 6H is not a true blockstring FYI, gaps in there where you can reflect or reversal out
[1:02:03] <dagrum> you can do 4m twice
[1:02:04] <+ArgCooper> Damn, no mercy
[1:02:08] <Parapattern> How is that even fun at 30-0?
[1:02:19] <%GohanEgret> in fairness Fuggins never played beyond trying the demo
[1:02:24] <Fluke_M> @Governor_Explosion Pick a game, pick a character, check a guide if you want but try things out in-game and play with people, the mashing will leave your body sooner or later.
[1:02:29] <+mechslayer71> Pat loves to stroke his own ego whenever he can @argcooper
[1:02:50] <Governor_Explosion> @Fluke_M Thank you!
[1:02:52] <Vashido22> @woolieversus after 22H, you can air dash, land, and combo
[1:02:53] <+ArgCooper> Pat is exactly the kind of person to enjoy a 30 to nothing win ratio
[1:02:55] <+pkmamsters> The Husband Command
[1:02:57] <kaine_west> learn combo, all a noob needs
[1:02:57] <dragonslayingronin> dedicated husband button
[1:02:58] <TheBrunoZone> @WoolieVersus 4th L rekka can be followed with an air dash, but it has horrible recovery unless you end it with 236L or M
[1:02:59] <+Graem> Is videl on funness par with Yamucha?
[1:02:59] <exalt4747> Really like how Woolie has unobtrusive notifs
[1:03:12] <+SvenHolgersson> So many options
[1:03:18] <dagrum> corner only
[1:03:22] <+pkmamsters> Here I Go!
[1:03:24] <Heartless_01> this is my first time seeing videl in this game. she looks super cute! TehePelo
[1:03:28] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus Not sure but I think Videl getting hit doesn't make Gohan go away, he still hits
[1:03:29] <spardanwarrior> BINGO
[1:03:32] <dagrum> you can pick it up with 2m
[1:03:32] <+SvenHolgersson> Videl is the CORNER QUEEN
[1:03:32] <%Solidnick18> BINGO
[1:03:46] <+mechslayer71> THATS A BINGO
[1:03:53] <Prevot> helmet Saiyaman >>>>>>> bandana Saiyaman
[1:03:58] <+jayfigga> Not going easy on your friends? Hard cut to the marvel 3 fisticuffs.
[1:04:01] <dragonslayingronin> that slow fireball seems to explicitly be designed for you to follow behind it or for pressure.
[1:04:05] <%Triforce505> sweet
[1:04:09] <%Cavumentum> Pigtails gets Saiyaman Helmet Forme so it's confirmed superior
[1:04:24] <Parapattern> Remember when Videl would have straight-up killed that big guy if he hadn't had that Majin-Buu spell on him?
[1:04:25] <gatorafan> Reminder that according to Woolie's established ranking 1-Bandana >>> 2-Helmet Kappa
[1:04:39] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Saiyaman pose off!
[1:04:40] <%QueequegTheater> WOolie is right about the bandana
[1:04:58] <Vashido22> @woolieversus she can 4MM
[1:05:05] <+sunnythedrunk> Remember when Goku and Supreme Kai held Gohan back as his girl got thrashed
[1:05:07] <+HallowedGuru> She also has a dodge instead of a reflect
[1:05:20] <dragonslayingronin> medium is always hard knockdown like ssj goku iirc
[1:05:24] <Governor_Explosion> TBH aside from Gohan, my favorite Kyle Hebert role is Kakyoin
[1:05:30] <+Dewitt1998> Servers are back up guys!
[1:05:46] <Run44forrest> servers were down?
[1:05:58] <+Dewitt1998> They went down at 8
[1:06:02] <Prevot> remember when videl literally broke spopovich's neck
[1:06:05] <+Dewitt1998> Emergency Maintenance
[1:06:13] <Vashido22> @woolieversus after 22H, you can air dash, land, then standing M
[1:06:20] <TheBrunoZone> @WoolieVersus 4th L rekka can be followed with an air dash, but it has horrible recovery unless you end it with 236L or M
[1:06:26] <dagrum> 4mm 2m 6h 236lll is a basic bnb
[1:06:33] <+Superkbrown95> Yeah, im not a dbz fan, but pigtail Videl is such a better look
[1:06:33] <+ssulcer> @woolieversus do 6H
[1:06:37] <gottigotbundles> maintenance every Tuesday
[1:06:38] <+Floofiie> How do you tag in a team member after launching them
[1:06:40] <Devonm0711> Remember when non saiyan characters could actually help fight?

[1:07:06] <%linkwolf4> woolieOMG
[1:07:07] <Limes528> Not Videl's style of pigtails
[1:07:11] <Parapattern> TRUTH
[1:07:13] <TomCrimson> @DrkJP520 nah woolie has to be wrong
[1:07:13] <reiju_22> REALLY WOOLIE THAT'S LOW
[1:07:14] <DynoGems> Videl is a HS girl in this version so....
[1:07:14] <%Triforce505> agreed
[1:07:15] <deviljhojho94> Woolie going HAM
[1:07:18] <ultimate_joker_main> @DrkJP520 what D: no way
[1:07:18] <deviljhojho94> BUT I AGREE
[1:07:21] <+GravityMilkShake> short hair is associated with DUDES
[1:07:21] <+Jeebus4> this is some really good dbz lore
[1:07:22] <+patriotrenegade> @woolieversus are you winning, son?
[1:07:22] <%Cavumentum> Motherfucker you know that short hair makes her look like Kid Gohan
[1:07:23] <+pkmamsters> WOOLIE'S DESPERATION MOVE
[1:07:24] <+SuichiTanaka> WRONG, pigtails like that are cowgirl pigtails
[1:07:25] <+Dewitt1998> Listen Videl's pigtails are the one exception dammit
[1:07:25] <+mechslayer71> Yeah, I’ve literally NEVER seen a grown woman with pigtails. @woolieversus
[1:07:32] <Lysdexic9541> Fuck. Off LUL
[1:07:32] <YeezusPieces1> Short hair is for girls who try to hard to be taken seriously
[1:07:33] <Homzie83> And porn stars
[1:07:34] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT'S BULLSHIT BUT I BELIEVE IT
[1:07:35] <+LastHazzerd> well i had a teacher in her mid 30s with pigtails... so i dunno what to think
[1:07:37] <CuttleCrow> looks like the gloves are coming off now
[1:07:39] <pirateofpie> Woolie Vs Chat is my favorite thing now
[1:07:42] <+patriotrenegade> @mechslayer71 have you never seen a Native American
[1:07:51] <Devonm0711> @pirateofpie I dig it
[1:07:55] <Run44forrest> probably not
[1:07:56] <%TheOneUpWarrior> The Coward Woolie shows his true form.._
[1:08:00] <%Triforce505> no, short hair is associated with greatness
[1:08:01] <+Tarantulawl> Short hair is associated with women who don't want their hair pulled during a fight
[1:08:02] <dagrum> the crossup isnt that great it gets beat by 2h soundly
[1:08:02] <theotrainwreck> yeah no loose pigtails + black hair completely kill that association for me
[1:08:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie vs The Wrong Half of Chat more like
[1:08:08] <%jdgamester> As a long haired man, I take personal umbridge to this slander against my pigtails I wear to work
[1:08:19] <+mechslayer71> @patriotrenegade No. As fucked up as it is, there’s not a whole lot of them left.... outside of reservations, anyway.
[1:08:19] <+Dewitt1998> BTW if you want some dead servers, the Canada, East cost servers are super dead
[1:08:25] <+patriotrenegade> What are we arguing about
[1:08:25] <exalt4747> The only thing lamer than the "short hair is better in a fight" argument is the pedo one.
[1:08:39] <Prevot> you'd think woolie of all people wouldn't have hair based prejudice
[1:08:53] <Governor_Explosion> I think she has a similar haircut to Gohan because Toriyama can only draw so many haircuts
[1:08:59] <+Irridium> @Dewitt1998 yeah they literally finished doing some maintenance so everything should be pretty empty rn
[1:09:08] <Parapattern> Woolie is 100% made of hair-based prejudice
[1:09:13] <%Triforce505> that rules
[1:09:14] <CookieCutter007> that BM
[1:09:16] <+Devilbringer133> @Governor_Explosion Bulma goest through 100 different hairstyles
[1:09:19] <CNightmare072> What does the counter do?
[1:09:20] <+LastHazzerd> Disrespect
[1:09:20] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:09:25] <+jayfigga> Lameeeee
[1:09:30] <+mechslayer71> @prevot He made his decision. Racial profiling wasn’t enough, he needED ADVANCED RACIAL PROFILING
[1:09:31] <+LastHazzerd> Thumbs UP
[1:09:31] <+Dewitt1998> Oh yeah
[1:09:31] <MyNameIsRasus> SAIYAMAN IS COOL SHUT UP
[1:09:32] <Sandro2584> Short hair all day
[1:09:32] <+Dewitt1998> Very true
[1:09:35] <+patriotrenegade> This is the stance: apatWhat _/_/
[1:09:37] <+Superkbrown95> I mean, being real,how long does hair have to be to be a danger in a fight?
[1:09:39] <CuttleCrow> its only cool with the helmet
[1:09:43] <blackjackskellington> Super on ground
[1:09:47] <+ssulcer> It’s not frame one counter though
[1:09:53] <Run44forrest> videl calvo when
[1:09:55] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> @cnightmare072 it buffs all move woth saiyaman
[1:09:56] <Parapattern> Saiyaman is SUPER LAME, but that's why he's cool
[1:09:57] <Governor_Explosion> @Devilbringer133 I mean he re-uses haircuts among various genders in his work (if you include Dragon Quest, Dr. Slump, Chrono Trigger, etc.)
[1:09:58] <+ssulcer> And it powers up gohan
[1:09:59] <Sandro2584> Fuck it even short hair bulma is superior to long hair bulma
[1:10:03] <+Irridium> that gohan counter super also powers up all of saiyaman's attacks too including the lvl 3 fyi @WoolieVersus
[1:10:06] <+Story_Ark> you know Jesus was a short hait girl?
[1:10:10] <SolSwagGuy56> Nah Gohan and Great Saiyaman are lame
[1:10:13] <SolSwagGuy56> Fuck Gohan
[1:10:14] <exalt4747> Depends on what you mean by long hair Bulma
[1:10:19] <Prevot> afro bulma is the superior bulma
[1:10:22] <CNightmare072> Can you counter super a fireball?
[1:10:25] <exalt4747> Bulma has like ten hairstyles
[1:10:31] <%linkwolf4> the ginyu force was definitely a bad influence on gohan.
[1:10:31] <Heartless_01> i havent seen her super yet
[1:10:33] <+skam1zvah> >gohan is lame
[1:10:34] <+Story_Ark> wtf Super Bulma is the best Bulma by FAR
[1:10:35] <Captain_Aham> shes what 17 should have been
[1:10:38] <Run44forrest> gohan in the saiyaman costume with no helmet is the best he's looked
[1:10:43] <%Ion_LaserX> @CEGold Gotta go. Thanks for the gift sub
[1:10:45] <+skam1zvah> that's a yikes from me
[1:10:45] <ultimate_joker_main> @CNightmare072 videl's counter does not work on projectiles
[1:10:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Okay chat, let's start the big boy talk: bandana Saiyaman or Helmet Saiyaman?
[1:10:51] <DoubledOgre> how strong is that jirry fella?
[1:10:52] <TigerClaws12> it's bardock but not bardock assist
[1:10:55] <exalt4747> Helmet for life
[1:10:59] <dagrum> jirens a parry god
[1:11:04] <+Dewitt1998> El Hermano's younger brother is alright
[1:11:06] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Helmet
[1:11:06] <Governor_Explosion> What I mean is that Bulma's hairstyles are sometimes used by other female characters (and sometimes male characters)
[1:11:07] <%Cavumentum> Helmet a best
[1:11:10] <Yeajow> Helmet easy
[1:11:13] <Prevot> bandana looks fucking awful
[1:11:16] <SolSwagGuy56> Jerry's Bizzare Adventure
[1:11:21] <EdgeOfGeekdom> down down heavy with videl too
[1:11:25] <MyNameIsRasus> Helmet is the correct answer
[1:11:26] <%skam1zvah> bandana looks dope too
[1:11:33] <Run44forrest> Gohan in the great kai rags PogChamp
[1:11:36] <SolSwagGuy56> Jiren's Autocombo's Third Hit looks pretty good
[1:11:37] <exalt4747> Even when I was a kid I thought the bandana and sunglasses look was dumb
[1:11:44] <tythedev> !guest
[1:11:47] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> "Cheelai, are they booing me?" "Uh of course not, they're saying Boo-roly! Boo-roly!"
[1:11:52] <%skam1zvah> you had bad taste as a kid too then
[1:11:52] <+ABadIdea> oh hey it's Jiren's Rich Girl kick
[1:11:53] <Subversity777> his 2l scales as a medium
[1:11:56] <%Triforce505> tf is that kick
[1:11:57] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus Videl also has an invincible wakeup on 214S
[1:11:59] <%TheOneUpWarrior> At least we can all agree on the helmet being best saiyaman
[1:12:05] <+Story_Ark> i was saying Booroly
[1:12:06] <drefizz> Jiren kinda has the build of a buff kim possible character
[1:12:06] <Parapattern> If the bandana wasn't just plain white, it'd look a lot better
[1:12:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Jiren looks fucking awful
[1:12:17] <Vashido22> 2S is his 2H
[1:12:18] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Agreed
[1:12:19] <dzmi13> The background look awesome :)
[1:12:22] <SolSwagGuy56> @MyNameIsRasus Like in general? Cause U agree
[1:12:22] <exalt4747> @TheOneupwarrior apparently not everyone, sadly
[1:12:26] <SolSwagGuy56> I*
[1:12:28] <luzoc> the best great saiyaman is no head covering at all
[1:12:45] <gatorafan> Well his looks weren't exactly a selling point... Nopt that I know what his selling point is beyond NUMBER
[1:12:46] <Prevot> @luzoc that's not saiyaman, that's just gohan
[1:13:04] <DoubledOgre> wow get a load of that alien spamming block Kappa
[1:13:07] <MyNameIsRasus> @solswagguy56 Yeah, his design is like the worst DBZ design. And I include movies and games
[1:13:10] <%Solidnick18> huh
[1:13:16] <TigerClaws12> DP gang
[1:13:19] <Iggeh0> hey look its pigtails videl vs lesser videl
[1:13:20] <+Story_Ark> even when you play as pigtail Videl the art still has short hair 🤔
[1:13:20] <exalt4747> I definitely wouldn't say it's the WORST
[1:13:22] <%TheOneUpWarrior> STRONGER THAN TIME
[1:13:25] <drefizz> @MyNameIsRasus hes not a dbz character thou
[1:13:25] <luzoc> @prevot no head covering in the great saiyaman outfit
[1:13:26] <Shalderave> Jiren is like a alpha prototype version of Frieza, he looks awful
[1:13:30] <spardanwarrior> Litteral punch lazer
[1:13:34] <IminyourBase> literal punch laser
[1:13:38] <+Dewitt1998> Garlic is pretty bad
[1:13:40] <SolSwagGuy56> @MyNameIsRasus But he makes up for it with style and personality Kappa
[1:13:40] <%TheOneUpWarrior> STRONGER THAN TODD HOWARD
[1:13:41] <exalt4747> Also hot take: Final Form Frieza doesn't look good
[1:13:43] <%linkwolf4> yo we got those wake up KNEES lytBADMAN
[1:13:45] <MyNameIsRasus> @drefizz My bad, general Dragon Ball
[1:13:45] <Governor_Explosion> Jiren's disproportionate torso-wise but a lot of characters are in DB
[1:14:01] <+Max_Kaiser> I actually like jiren lol
[1:14:02] <DoubledOgre> hes not as bad as one piece characters though
[1:14:04] <Captain_Aham> it's got stupid invincibility too
[1:14:06] <SolSwagGuy56> @TheOneUpWarrior I think Godd Coward would be a interesting concept for a DBZ character
[1:14:13] <Prevot> Jiren definitely looks less worse with the shirt off
[1:14:14] <SolSwagGuy56> @DoubledOgre Nah
[1:14:17] <drefizz> One piece characters are worse i AGREE
[1:14:20] <gatorafan> Todd Howard attempted to fight Jiren. And that's why Fallout 76 is like it is.
[1:14:21] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Good lord yes
[1:14:29] <Run44forrest> so this is woolies team? ResidentSleeper
[1:14:35] <Prevot> motherfuckers talking shit about one piece now
[1:14:36] <+sunnythedrunk> Jiren def gets a lot of shit because he was the final boss
[1:14:39] <+Story_Ark> you know youre technically always playing as short hair videl according to the art, so its the best
[1:14:44] <+Max_Kaiser> We shouldn’t have left jiren to Todd howard
[1:14:45] <Governor_Explosion> My wonk with the OP characters is when Oda draws women with no waist and a giant face
[1:14:46] <%Triforce505> counter?
[1:14:47] <exalt4747> People see one nose or what not and immediately talk shit about every One Piece character smh
[1:14:49] <BadgerDK> ex counter is frame 1
[1:14:50] <SolSwagGuy56> DBS didn't have any great villains
[1:14:51] <dagrum> you can get a combo starting with the parry
[1:14:52] <exalt4747> Granted, that was once me
[1:14:53] <+Dewitt1998> Nah it's Cell, Hit, Android 16
[1:14:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah but One Piece characters are generally interesting and likable
[1:15:00] <SolSwagGuy56> Zamasu was just alright
[1:15:03] <Parapattern> Jiren looks like an anime version of that short guy in that meme looking up at the woman with a microphone
[1:15:04] <exalt4747> So the sins will be forgiven in Heaven
[1:15:09] <ZaibatsuFan> @gatorafan The Fallout universe was erased.
[1:15:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Which Jiren is not
[1:15:13] <Limes528> @MyNameIsRasus fair
[1:15:16] <Prevot> literal last OP chapter had 10 ninja designs in one page more original than anything out of naruto
[1:15:17] <drefizz> @MyNameIsRasus everyone in one pice cries a lot
[1:15:21] <+Dewitt1998> Tbh most DBZ designs are pretty bland, it's just that jiren is the most bland
[1:15:23] <Captain_Aham> you can lvl3 too
[1:15:23] <gatorafan> @exalt4747, But Ussops nose number IS SO BIG
[1:15:29] <SolSwagGuy56> I mean most One Piece characters are better than KARATE GI man
[1:15:44] <+sunnythedrunk> Jiren's powers are boring too
[1:15:46] <MyNameIsRasus> @drefizz they do
[1:15:50] <Governor_Explosion> Isn't there a One Piece character that's just Shinsuke Nakamura
[1:15:54] <exalt4747> I think some his moves are neat tbh
[1:15:55] <+Max_Kaiser> I think one piece has great character designs
[1:16:00] <Sandro2584> Jiren is hype nyquil
[1:16:03] <%TheOneUpWarrior> KRILLIN!
[1:16:10] <%skam1zvah> >jiren is boring yes thats the joke
[1:16:12] <$megamonmon123> simplicity is sometimes better
[1:16:20] <%Triforce505> is that a joke?
[1:16:21] <SolSwagGuy56> Jiren should have played up the superhero thing more
[1:16:22] <asd2897> my favorite is jirens j2h
[1:16:29] <SolSwagGuy56> Make him a cool sentai big guy
[1:16:30] <Run44forrest> i never saw super how the hell did they beat Hit? doesnt he have time stop
[1:16:32] <horton_hears_you> @WoolieVersus his jM gets 2 hits
[1:16:36] <TopLeftCenter> The shoulder goes through projectiles
[1:16:37] <%TheOneUpWarrior> More boring than time?
[1:16:38] <gottigotbundles> use his ki blast launcher for same side launcher
[1:16:39] <godzookylives> I think Jiren could be represented as a piece of cardboard and the effect would still be the same
[1:16:40] <Subversity777> it beats beams
[1:16:40] <SolSwagGuy56> @Run44forrest He punched hard
[1:16:41] <$megamonmon123> some one piece designs are a bit much
[1:16:42] <Prevot> Jiren is stronger than time
[1:16:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Jiren as a sentai would have been cooler
[1:16:48] <drefizz> @SolSwagGuy56 they had a sentai guy, vegeta broke him
[1:16:49] <xBiggestD> You use down S for a normal 2h
[1:17:00] <%TheOneUpWarrior> More boring than time
[1:17:00] <Sandro2584> @megamonmon123 Yea but when your character has no personality trait besides good punch man is that really an excuse
[1:17:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Literally anything would be better than nothing at all
[1:17:08] <exalt4747> Hit wasn't even allowed to go all the way because he was under no kill rules
[1:17:10] <SolSwagGuy56> @drefizz Ok one who wasn't a compelte jobber joke
[1:17:20] <exalt4747> Goku threw his fight with Hit for that reason
[1:17:23] <gatorafan> Also I'm pretty sure Hit won that tournament
[1:17:34] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Jiren's bnb air combo is MlL, ML S super dash LM S 2H
[1:17:41] <SolSwagGuy56> I'll give Jiren this, at least he looks ripped. Fuck you Cabba
[1:17:49] <Prevot> ^
[1:17:51] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Agreed
[1:17:51] <Subversity777> air 2S 2H in corner
[1:17:51] <exalt4747> MIL?
[1:17:53] <+Story_Ark> they should have kept Hit as the pseudo antagonist
[1:17:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Agreed
[1:17:59] <drefizz> the ToP had Hit at a huge disadvantage cause of no kill rule
[1:18:11] <%linkwolf4> power GEYSER
[1:18:13] <+captain_history> Jiren without the shirt is super ripped
[1:18:14] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> woolieWHENS woolieWHENS woolieWHENS woolieWHENS woolieWHENS woolieWHENS woolieWHENS woolieWHENS
[1:18:15] <+sunnythedrunk> Universe 6 as the last fighters would have been hype af
[1:18:16] <gatorafan> U6's saiyans in general look like they didn't eat their Vegitas moon2E
[1:18:18] <$megamonmon123> im not defending jiren specifically. someone was bad talking dragonball designs
[1:18:18] <drefizz> Also I want Hit's background
[1:18:18] <SolSwagGuy56> Hit wasn't gonna do shit against dudes like Toppo of Ribrianne
[1:18:23] <heyitsdenzel_> Grand Upper
[1:18:27] <+ssulcer> Next pack should be radditz and vegetal bro lol
[1:18:29] <SolSwagGuy56> He was already Tien'd
[1:18:30] <%Triforce505> does that hit overhead?
[1:18:31] <+Story_Ark> winter soldier? did they make another MvC game?
[1:18:35] <LibriJamm> Test Jiren standing Ki blast vs super dash.
[1:18:36] <+BrendorTheEndor> That super combos into spirit bomb anywhere on screen, the uppercut
[1:18:36] <Governor_Explosion> Was Hit really based on Jotaro or is that just a 'my uncle is John Toriyama, Akira Toriyama's brother' thing
[1:18:40] <SolSwagGuy56> Or Piccollo'd
[1:18:47] <Fluke_M> @Story_Ark He was a DLC in MvCI
[1:18:50] <Shalderave> JIren is just One Punch Man played straight, so he's not very interesting without any irony or humor
[1:19:07] <DrkJP520> Jiren should get a Sasuke alt costume.
[1:19:09] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Woosh
[1:19:18] <$megamonmon123> i mean kinda? @shalderave but also not really
[1:19:21] <%TheOneUpWarrior> COOLER!
[1:19:22] <Governor_Explosion> Realistically you couldn't put Saitama or Mob in a game which is sad
[1:19:25] <+Story_Ark> @fluke_m lol srry that was a joke
[1:19:27] <drefizz> I honestly dont find OPM interesting at all
[1:19:30] <exalt4747> same
[1:19:32] <Sandro2584> Jiren is so boring even puts himself to sleep halfways through the TOP
[1:19:33] <+Haarute> His Ms are so big.
[1:19:37] <%TheOneUpWarrior> 100 percent cooler
[1:19:37] <%skam1zvah> mob psycho is better
[1:19:41] <%CEGold> I'm back!! woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[1:19:42] <Vashido22> It's a dp
[1:19:44] <pinpopy> His knees have armor
[1:19:44] <%thatonestraightman> he looks cool(er)
[1:19:45] <SolSwagGuy56> @Sandro2584 He took a fucking nap lol
[1:19:45] <gatorafan> Also Jiren lacks a lot of the quirks Saitama has like being an idiot and really disappointed to be at the point where nothing challenges him.
[1:19:47] <KeiPrime> YA
[1:19:48] <Vashido22> yeAHHHHHHH
[1:19:51] <Run44forrest> i remember hearing hit doesnt train he just time travels to a point in time where his numbers bigger???
[1:19:52] <BadgerDK> you dont use smash in his bnb since you can superdash after jS
[1:19:52] <+jayfigga> Hits universe like 3rd bottom tier in a kill only ToP
[1:19:53] <+kewlmyc> YEAHHHHH
[1:19:53] <+LastHazzerd> that was Cooler!?
[1:19:54] <Limes528> The current arc in the OPM manga is fuckin awesome
[1:19:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Saitama wouldn't have a moveset, but Mob would
[1:19:56] <+Dman1500> AYAYA YAAAA
[1:19:56] <IminyourBase> eeyee
[1:19:56] <+Irridium> ARE YOU TRIPPIN'
[1:19:58] <+Big_Dream> Long hair videl is best
[1:19:59] <dmysta3000> EYAAHHHHH
[1:20:00] <blackjackskellington> Press button again after uppercut
[1:20:01] <gatorafan> That said I don't really like OPM so...
[1:20:03] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Trembling*
[1:20:03] <+gael_jebidibah> He's an anime girl
[1:20:05] <%CEGold> I THOUGHT THAT WAS EDITED IN?!
[1:20:06] <+ryu781> YO WASSUP PEEPO
[1:20:07] <SolSwagGuy56> What if Jiren had All MIght's personality
[1:20:10] <funkieboy> his uppercut has followups
[1:20:16] <DrkJP520> He's immitating the JP Coola with the "YAAA"
[1:20:19] <+Irridium> @Soul_Bruce_Lee I choose to hear trippin'
[1:20:19] <MyNameIsRasus> @solswagguy56 YOOOOOO
[1:20:19] <Shalderave> @SolSwagGuy56 NOW THAT is something I could get behind
[1:20:20] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus A full screen low, what a GROUND BREAKING DISCOVERY
[1:20:21] <$megamonmon123> @gatorafan that suggests all op characters are have to be like saitama and thats wrong
[1:20:22] <Prevot> what if Jiren had a personality
[1:20:24] <exalt4747> They should have just made Toppo be the boss character
[1:20:27] <+captain_history> Jiren being boring is kind of the point of his character. He literally only cares about power
[1:20:31] <%Triforce505> what if kiren had any personality?
[1:20:37] <extradopeness> Yooooo Cooler
[1:20:38] <KeiPrime> what if jiren had short hair
[1:20:40] <drefizz> who knows, Jiren could come back and be a bit happier
[1:20:43] <SolSwagGuy56> @captain_history Why is he a super hero then
[1:20:48] <+sunnythedrunk> His air super is better
[1:20:50] <+balouie> I have always wondered are freeza and picollos race considered all males
[1:20:51] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Jiren -Might is the hero we need
[1:20:53] <Sandro2584> @captain_history but that doesnt make him a good character
[1:20:53] <$megamonmon123> jiren has a personality, unfortunately that personality is being super reserved and quiet most of the time
[1:20:54] <SolSwagGuy56> What's the point of making him one writing wise
[1:21:02] <drefizz> @SolSwagGuy56 he doesnt want people to die in his universe
[1:21:09] <drefizz> I think
[1:21:18] <+captain_history> @SolSwagGuy56 Because absolute power equals absolute justice
[1:21:18] <DrkJP520> If Jiren had JoJo poses, he'd be about 1000% more interesting
[1:21:20] <gatorafan> @megamonmon123, I don't remember satying that, I just answered the comment mentioning Jiren being a copy of Saitama and saying he doesn't even manage to do that.
[1:21:21] <%CEGold> I always liked the idea that Jiren was Great Saiyaman ramped up to 11 and the pride troopers formed around him while he just tolerated them
[1:21:27] <exalt4747> He wants power because DEAD PARENTS
[1:21:28] <SolSwagGuy56> @drefizz Maybe that should come through in his personality/fights
[1:21:31] <Vashido22> SO SAD
[1:21:33] <+Haarute> It's a grab in mid air.
[1:21:34] <exalt4747> That's why he's a super hero
[1:21:36] <Gutsandlove> IN THE AIR
[1:21:41] <Shalderave> That might be an interesting character if done right, but it wasn't. Instead, he's just a piece of cardboard. Even people with one-track-minds have some other quirks and characteristics
[1:21:43] <Governor_Explosion> There is a difference between 'my character is reserved because [valid reason]' and 'my character is reserved because I don't know how to write him'
[1:21:49] <odd_slater> SO SAD
[1:21:50] <+captain_history> @SolSwagGuy56 That whole idea works better with him being a super hero
[1:21:50] <businesscasualninja> SO SAD
[1:21:51] <Sandro2584> @drefizz jiren says himself the only thing he cares abt is his strength
[1:21:58] <NotVeryG> Lol who said "What if Jiren had short hair "
[1:21:59] <+jayfigga> Didn’t jiren make the justice league in his universe. It’s been a while since I seen super.
[1:22:01] <drefizz> I would like to see Jiren come back and change how he act since he fought goku
[1:22:02] <%jinking79> use dive kick with lvl 3
[1:22:06] <%TheOneUpWarrior> SO SAD
[1:22:12] <$megamonmon123> @jayfigga basically
[1:22:14] <MyNameIsRasus> What if Jiren had pigtails
[1:22:14] <+EyeRChris> I want ot see Team Good Family, Mystic Gohan, Videl, and Goten
[1:22:17] <%TheOneUpWarrior> UWAAH
[1:22:19] <RadShiro> @WoolieVersus You can hit his air lvl 3 after a divekick
[1:22:24] <+Story_Ark> @jayfigga actually fix Jiren??
[1:22:27] <CMediaAstra> a lot of attacks to Jiren, from people who couldn't write at a 3rd grade level.
[1:22:27] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus I think if you tiger knee it it will whiff if they crouch
[1:22:30] <+OceanGovernor> Jiren is stronger than hair
[1:22:37] <godzookylives> Jiren would probably look pretty cute with pigtails
[1:22:38] <%skam1zvah> jiren feels like a parody of dragonball ocs
[1:22:40] <%skam1zvah> which is the point
[1:22:48] <Prevot> the only thing Jiren isn't stronger than is El Hermano
[1:22:51] <+captain_history> his whole backstory isn't even important? I mean it's a boring backstory to play in the idea he is boring
[1:22:51] <$megamonmon123> @cmediaastra dont be like that man
[1:22:51] <SolSwagGuy56> Honestly El Hermano is a superior character writing wise
[1:22:54] <%CEGold> Toppo should've taken Jiren's spot as the main antagonist of TOP cmonBruh
[1:22:57] <+Story_Ark> "i made the character bad on purpose!"
[1:23:03] <%skam1zvah> "this is my oc jiren hes the strongest ever he could beat goku instantly hes so cool"
[1:23:14] <%skam1zvah> yes it's called a joke
[1:23:17] <MyNameIsRasus> I wrote Jiren wrong! As a joke!
[1:23:20] <SolSwagGuy56> So many of DBFZ's character's don't feel complete/focused\
[1:23:24] <+mechslayer71> JIREN IS BLAND? NO WAY Kappa
[1:23:27] <Lysdexic9541> I hope El Grande Padre is coming this season
[1:23:31] <A_d3adly_zambo> hiya woolz
[1:23:32] <Shalderave> Being boring ironically still isn't fun to watch or read
[1:23:38] <+Irridium> el ermano for smash
[1:23:38] <oillade> Gohan Blanco when
[1:23:38] <Vashido22> 17 is literally the WORST in the game
[1:23:39] <Lucasleonava> No damage
[1:23:42] <A_d3adly_zambo> and Crew
[1:23:43] <etalmeta> jokes don't work if they last as long as jiren did
[1:23:46] <%skam1zvah> it is when he's surrounded by people who aren't boring
[1:23:50] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus 17 is so low he has his own tier
[1:23:51] <funkieboy> he has command normals too
[1:23:53] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Gohan Blanco will save us
[1:23:56] <horton_hears_you> I think jiren is a lot of fun tho.... NotLikeThis
[1:24:02] <SolSwagGuy56> How do you fight gud Woolie
[1:24:03] <funkieboy> one lf his command normals is beam immune
[1:24:03] <+gralho> Do you like apples?
[1:24:08] <+Story_Ark> "this one guy isnt boring so thats the joke"
[1:24:09] <+captain_history> Jiren works alright for what he is supposed to represent in the TOP, but he is not compelling outside of that yeah
[1:24:11] <Vashido22> he is
[1:24:11] <+JustGrim> i showed up late, so my question is who's the white guy in the middle
[1:24:12] <MyNameIsRasus> How to not suck?
[1:24:12] <Luvinsus> So Woolie, did you or did you not let Pat win? Kappa @WoolieVersus
[1:24:15] <slimcognitoentertainment> Why does it feel like nobody here watched the anime? Jinren is good. Let's watch fight games.
[1:24:16] <$megamonmon123> are we gonna complain about jiren every time he is on screen? cause thats gonna get old
[1:24:16] <+Irridium> oh beerus isn't bottom tier now?
[1:24:18] <Sandro2584> @skam1zvah name one member of the pride troopers besides toppo
[1:24:18] <%skam1zvah> "this one guy"
[1:24:18] <Eternal_Harmony> hes actually the worst character rn
[1:24:22] <SolSwagGuy56> Haha I remember fuckers hyping 17 up as top tier before release
[1:24:24] <Subversity777> Yes he suffers from poor normals
[1:24:24] <enlightenedcorgi> I don't play fighting games much, is there one I should play to start out?
[1:24:26] <gatorafan> Who cares about fighting games? We are talking about LORE here Kappa
[1:24:27] <+Okosisi89> The middle guy is super quiet.
[1:24:30] <CMediaAstra> 17 is not as bad as he used to be.
[1:24:30] <oillade> Dyspo
[1:24:38] <%skam1zvah> @oceanantic dbfz, UNIST or sf
[1:24:39] <+ssulcer> You can just spam reflect against his rekkas
[1:24:39] <$megamonmon123> @gatorafan you mean complaining about jiren
[1:24:40] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Look at his normals. And all his rekkas are pretty much fake
[1:24:42] <SolSwagGuy56> "ohhhh he's gonna stomp Bardock and Cell he's sooooo good"
[1:24:45] <+mechslayer71> Below Beerus?!?!
[1:24:53] <%skam1zvah> beerus is dope fug u
[1:24:56] <SolSwagGuy56> @mechslayer71 Beerus is mid tier I'd say now
[1:24:57] <gatorafan> @megamonmon123, yeah. LORE moon2E
[1:24:59] <Vashido22> @mechslayer71 Beerus got buffed
[1:25:02] <Vashido22> and he's mid tier now
[1:25:04] <%CEGold> "I'mma beat you like a rug!"- 17
[1:25:06] <The_Gonzales_Experience> @mechslayer71 beerus is good now
[1:25:09] <silverback129> Bad normals and his main rekka you can reflect
[1:25:09] <spawnzie> HAAAAAAAA
[1:25:09] <Nayafer91> @WoolieVersus hey did you wach the kombat cast? sorry is someone ask this before. much love woolie.
[1:25:15] <Shalderave> Wow that kinda sucks, 17's style is really cool
[1:25:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Who's top tier now?
[1:25:29] <$megamonmon123> yamacha better be top rier
[1:25:35] <+Story_Ark> beerus is one of the few good things Super brought us
[1:25:36] <SolSwagGuy56> 17 should have used barriers more, his moveset is kinda ass
[1:25:36] <Sandro2584> 17 got shafted he deserves to be so much better
[1:25:37] <RadShiro> as the MVP of the ToP, a17 deserved better
[1:25:37] <%TheOneUpWarrior> 17 LOOKS hype tho. Sadly he just doesn't DO the thing as well as everyone else
[1:25:38] <exalt4747> I had so much fun when i tried 17 at launch. was really disappointed at how that turnedout
[1:25:39] <+mechslayer71> Oh ok cool, good to hear. I found him fun but was sad when he was shit
[1:25:46] <$EyeRChris> cheer500 Any advise for those of us who like to fight the CPU to transition to not be a scrub lord the second we touch ranked play?
[1:25:49] <exalt4747> I hate how super wanked 17 though
[1:25:58] <drefizz> Wait...is 17 the first db character to fight wearing Jeans?
[1:25:58] <+Lillowh> Wow that's trashy
[1:25:59] <Datwiseguy> also has stubby limbs
[1:26:00] <SolSwagGuy56> @exalt4747 agreed
[1:26:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Yamcha is so cool
[1:26:05] <gravitydazequeen> @exalt4747 Wanked?
[1:26:06] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Look at the range of his 5l and 2M
[1:26:07] <Datwiseguy> doodoo assist
[1:26:09] <Vashido22> its sad LUL
[1:26:14] <Sandro2584> Also why no explosion for the ultimate
[1:26:30] <+GreatestGuess> 17 is probably the worst character in the game
[1:26:32] <businesscasualninja> with cooler throw out his neutral S before you hit his tiger knee for another hit @woolieversus
[1:26:37] <%TheOneUpWarrior> OMG HES WEIRD VEGA
[1:26:44] <%Rawklobstah88> @WoolieVersus I've only been playing fighting games for a couple years, but I have a lot of fun playing them. I got into them from you and Max's influence, and it's always a great time. I got my first stick in September and already feel somewhat okay using it. Thank you for all the time and effort you take for us, Woolie. Also, Reggie, you're a cool guy and we love you.
[1:26:54] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Slide scales like an L tho
[1:26:54] <EyeRChris> @TheOneUpWarrior Wierd Vega with a boat
[1:26:57] <SolSwagGuy56> NOt many of the DLC characters are good
[1:26:59] <+stupidname37> Will you guys be covering Guilty Gear Rev 2?
[1:27:10] <+Jeebus4> Is for honor a fighting game?
[1:27:11] <enlightenedcorgi> @WoolieVersus Do you play any survival crafting games?
[1:27:17] <gatorafan> And then there is Bardock
[1:27:18] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Sick ass yachttt
[1:27:27] <%CEGold> Anyone else think Videl should've continued to train post-Buu saga? I hated how having Pan robbed her of her spunk
[1:27:30] <Emdhad> I don't know Bardock Zamasu Broly Base vegeta base Goku are all good
[1:27:39] <$megamonmon123> @woolieversus are you excited to play gogeta in this game since the movie confirmed he is the best fusion?
[1:27:44] <EyeRChris> @SolSwagGuy56 Bardock seems to be the favorite of the DLC for fighting ability
[1:27:46] <Emdhad> also vwgito
[1:27:47] <%Solidnick18> @Jeebus4 yes
[1:27:48] <+sunnythedrunk> Keep your good assists
[1:27:53] <exalt4747> Where di the movie confirm that though?
[1:27:53] <%skam1zvah> @CEGold toriyama can't write women well so yes i feel you
[1:27:56] <gravitydazequeen> Isn't Base Vegeta the best Vegeta?
[1:27:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie wants to experiment guys! It's a sex thing!
[1:27:57] <$megamonmon123> yes gogeta better than vegito
[1:27:58] <+GravityMilkShake> @WoolieVersus At what skill level should i start going to locals? I need to get out more but im scared of getting stomped
[1:27:58] <CMediaAstra> Jiren, videl, base goku. is a pretty good team!
[1:27:59] <gatorafan> @cegold, Sadly that's the case for a lot of characters, not just Videl.
[1:28:01] <+Story_Ark> @cegold 100%, when 18 still fights Videl has no excuse
[1:28:04] <xemeas> He has a counter inside the recka , its useless but still there
[1:28:06] <+TintainiumCan> @CEGold Are you asking if a female character should have had a bigger role in DBZ?
[1:28:06] <RadShiro> @WoolieVersus when will we see a video on the VS mode of Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith video game??? lytSNEER
[1:28:09] <drefizz> @WoolieVersus I'm glad you got me into watching jojo around when part 3 started airing on crunchyroll, Jojo has become one of my favorite animes
[1:28:10] <Run44forrest> red square oh worm?
[1:28:23] <%skam1zvah> @RadShiro that message punched my childhood
[1:28:24] <Aubreon> SSJ Vegeta allows videl a DR after lvl 1
[1:28:30] <+Kaito_Cam> @WoolieVersus So if i've never played a fighting game should I go controller or fight stick I have problems doing the quarter circles from playing smash with ryu
[1:28:33] <Datwiseguy> which server?
[1:28:37] <+projectrad> Haven't picked the game up in ages, plus finishing up Lucky Mark hunting in KH3. Some other time, sadly :(
[1:28:38] <The_Gonzales_Experience> @gravitydazequeen for Point. SS Vegeta still has an amazing assist.
[1:28:53] <RadShiro> @skam1zvah hell yeah
[1:28:56] <gravitydazequeen> Ah

[1:29:15] <+sunnythedrunk> yeah

[1:38:15] <Emdhad> this line is kinda chaotic
[1:38:15] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus You may be better off, instead of doing these ring matches, to just do an arena match, it will just matchmake you with everyone in the arena and you can still deny those who get a second turn too early
[1:38:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> @theman515 thank you
[1:38:22] <$megamonmon123> @cegold unfortunately yuyu isnt as evergreen as dragonball

[1:52:45] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @sandro2584 If they add him they most likely won't do one arm especially since the anime doesn't even use blood anymore
[1:52:46] <ZombieShooz> @Sandro2584 it's likely because gohans adult form is now in super and they worry about confusing people
[1:52:47] <Polengoldur> @TheOneUpWarrior pat will be reading subs until 2am
[1:52:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Got it
[1:52:53] <Aubreon> @mynameisrasus a special move that you can basically do the same input to chain it together
[1:52:59] <+nharliecash> @MyNameIsRasus its a special move that combos naturally named after fie longs rekka ken punch

[1:53:19] <+FierceDeityGabriel> You started recording
[1:53:21] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> It's saying that you can't record because you're using the anime music @woolieversus

[1:56:01] <3xgilly> @WoolieVersus you guys could each create your own team per slot instead of constantly changing
[1:56:04] <Laironx3> "don't let it rock"
[1:56:06] <KeiPrime> you should have set up teams beforehand
[1:56:09] <KiraKamixephos> You guys could try arena matches

[1:59:47] <%ventus_fury> Ouch
[1:59:49] <Sol_Install> Your going down captain
[1:59:53] <+Qwertoqwerto> These buttons
[2:00:02] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus Just so you know, an 8 Player ring match has two lobbies you can use, so if you need to change any settings you can just use the other lobby to reset everything
[2:00:09] <DrkJP520> Why the hell did the line change??
[2:00:16] <%Eaglestrike117> Because the lobby switched
[2:00:19] <danknugglit> Rip reggie
[2:00:20] <extradopeness> Some bnbs are just too fun to quit
[2:00:23] <+jayfigga> I told you not to hold back haha
[2:00:24] <TheBrunoZone> LINE HAS BEEN TAMPERED

[2:02:48] <gottigotbundles> cluster
[2:02:49] <drefizz> chat went rogue
[2:02:49] <ECRead> FOR SOM FUCKING REASON
[2:02:52] <+nharliecash> how can the lines be real if our eyes arent real
[2:02:53] <CNightmare072> Whats the difference between blue Vegito & blue Gogeta? Like why?!
[2:02:58] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> VeCheeto
[2:02:59] <TigerClaws12> how do you select pigtail videl at the edit team screen?
[2:03:02] <+a_deadbeat> anchor Hit? The madman
[2:03:03] <%Skullgod> Dub is good
[2:03:04] <Sol_Install> The dub is good
[2:03:04] <+Dewitt1998> Press l1
[2:03:09] <+ssulcer> The dub is good
[2:03:11] <Aubreon> @tigerclaws12 l1
[2:03:11] <danknugglit> Just make a 3rd line and say its the real line
[2:03:13] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Dub is 10/10
[2:03:14] <RadShiro> GOGETA! GOGETA! GOGETA! GO GO GOGETA!
[2:03:14] <SpiritsRiseR2> The dub is great
[2:03:18] <ARBITERWARPIG> Gogeta and Vegito have different abilities
[2:03:19] <TheBrunoZone> CHAT, THE LINE ON THE RIGHT IS THE REAL LINE, DON'T LET THE LEFT LINE FOOL YOU
[2:03:20] <Sandro2584> Blue vegito is better thats the main difference
[2:03:20] <Bearzone> hold l1
[2:03:22] <%CEGold> @CNightmare072 Especially since they both got a timelimit
[2:03:23] <ofalconer> I'd love to see Raditz and Kid Goku in the next season
[2:03:33] <3xgilly> it dub is actually pretty good
[2:03:34] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Gogeta has stardust breaker he's better
[2:03:41] <Bearzone> left line 4 lyfe
[2:03:45] <%ventus_fury> Back of the line crew towards tourney mode
[2:03:46] <ofalconer> Wanna have that team of Vegeta, Nappa, Raditz
[2:03:52] <+nharliecash> lot of apologists for the dub
[2:03:54] <Captain_Aham> put vegito point for better bar gain
[2:03:55] <%Menitta> Eagle you suck
[2:03:57] <+Take_2_shots> yo you hear about that vic stuff coming out?
[2:03:59] <Sandro2584> Vegito has a better design and the final kamehameha
[2:04:01] <DrkJP520> I fucking hope the Broli movie comes to cinemas in Sweden
[2:04:02] <CNightmare072> like, I like Vegito & the concept of it, but why are the names reversed? How different are they if at all? It kjust seems dumb. Would rather have Buu saga Vegito
[2:04:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay, so i've given up trying to get in cause there's 2 lines and these matches take a long time.
[2:04:05] <+GunterDriger6> Ssj4 Gogeta would look amazing tho!
[2:04:06] <Sol_Install> @nharliecash like it was a good dub
[2:04:07] <CrmznOgre> was watching your anime fighting game study vid, but guess I'll save it for later
[2:04:09] <ARBITERWARPIG> THE BEST ONE IS SSJ4 GOGETA
[2:04:17] <%Greatnumber> So what does chat think the other two characters will be?
[2:04:18] <+nharliecash> @Sol_Install compared to what
[2:04:19] <drefizz> Gogeta and vegito are equal for me, both have strengths and weaknesses
[2:04:23] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 This is Gogeta slander and I will see you in court, my good sir cmonBruh
[2:04:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[2:04:28] <ECRead> Yes
[2:04:28] <HanPaul> not using the new characters DansGame
[2:04:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> nope, both are online
[2:04:31] <exalt4747> @greatnumber Kefla will probably be one
[2:04:32] <SpookyBeef7> In theaters? English only.
[2:04:33] <theziggystar> only dub
[2:04:35] <+Irridium> theaters are dubbed
[2:04:38] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> In theaters it's only dubbed
[2:04:40] <+unbARECKable> At all the theaters I've seen its only been the dub
[2:04:41] <Mrzero58 > its only dub in thee theatres
[2:04:46] <+Floofiie> <3
[2:04:46] <3xgilly> Ive only seen dub online but that could change
[2:04:56] <Vashido22> backjump after lvl3 LUL
[2:05:02] <Sandro2584> @cegold good luck getting into the courtroom with your open front crop top and belt sash
[2:05:09] <DrkJP520> Only Eng in America? Wtf kind of cinemas show movies without their original audio as an option?
[2:05:10] <Sol_Install> @nharliecash It doesn't need to be compare. it's a good dub
[2:05:18] <eldragon_1> our theaters had both
[2:05:21] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 I SAID GOOD DAY SIR!!!
[2:05:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, this line isn't gonna reach woolie if i'm in the back considering match length.
[2:05:38] <+nharliecash> thats a cop out of an answer
[2:05:39] <ECRead> Dub is a better version of the movie in my opinion tho. Localization did a damn good job @WoolieVersus
[2:05:42] <drefizz> if Vegito and Gogeta fused we wouldnt be arguing who is better
[2:05:49] <%Greatnumber> @exalt4747 I agree, and the last slot will probably be UI Goku
[2:05:53] <%Menitta> Everyone in eagle's line go back to the big line
[2:05:59] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @drefizz shotoWut
[2:06:00] <extradopeness> Yeah the DBZ dubs are FINE its thirty percent yelling anyway

[2:06:38] <%NumberTooBig> can't wait for Yajirobe for season 2... where he just plays like johnny Kappa
[2:06:40] <theziggystar> @woolieversus What fighting game(s) do you have the most love/hate relationship with?
[2:06:41] <ARBITERWARPIG> I prefer sub for Dragonball content
[2:06:46] <TheBrunoZone> Well fuck that LUL
[2:06:47] <ofalconer> @DrkJP520 I mean, most movies in general play dubbed for their regions. Avengers in france isn't the original english. That's not as unheard of as you think it is.
[2:06:49] <+Qwertoqwerto> _/_/
[2:06:55] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 Not unless you're Zamasu or Buuhan Kappa

[2:07:57] <zackmuffin> @soul_bruce_lee I think it was 54 or 53
[2:08:10] <ARBITERWARPIG> SSJ4 Goku and UI Goku
[2:08:14] <+FierceDeityGabriel> UI Goku and Kefla
[2:08:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Between dub or sub, i choose abridged
[2:08:16] <Sandro2584> Vegito is the Brennan Williams to Gogetas Woolie they both fun characters but one clearly won the competition
[2:08:17] <KantusMonkus> my monney is on keffla and janemba
[2:08:17] <CNightmare072> Kefla & Super Boo. Hard callin' it.
[2:08:19] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Raditz deserves his spot
[2:08:20] <Bearzone> bbnb tech right there
[2:08:22] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 At least Gogeta has a confirmed kill to his name
[2:08:25] <Vashido22> All packs have a theme
[2:08:26] <%CEGold> Kappa
[2:08:29] <%NumberTooBig> Arale and Yajirobe would be hilarious
[2:08:30] <Vashido22> Who will come with kefla?
[2:08:32] <+Dewitt1998> I didn't know it was best to 2 lol
[2:08:34] <+Dewitt1998> Big oops
[2:08:35] <Vashido22> They need to share a theme
[2:08:35] <exalt4747> I would like the other one to be Toppo but I'm not counting on it
[2:08:38] <extradopeness> I mean subs are fine the problem is literally the japanese dub
[2:08:45] <CNightmare072> Is it wrong that I really want Super Buu/Buuhan?
[2:08:45] <Prism_Wing> Give us Launch, dammit! SwiftRage
[2:08:46] <%vjcruzer> kefla and Toppa for the love of God
[2:08:46] <%Greatnumber> What if the new girl is Launch
[2:08:47] <+VektorTroika> MONSTER CARROT
[2:08:48] <Deadpool2450> where's my horny old man representation?
[2:08:57] <DrkJP520> Plus, with Kefla we may get a dramatic finish of the hypest kamehameha ever
[2:09:01] <extradopeness> LAUNCH YES
[2:09:02] <blackjackskellington> Turles and Kefla are best case for me
[2:09:02] <%Greatnumber> @Prism_Wing my man
[2:09:03] <Sol_Install> I'm still wondering whose the auburn color character
[2:09:04] <Firemane1279> RAAAAAA doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype
[2:09:07] <%CEGold> @CNightmare072 Nah. All Buus are different enough to justify different spots
[2:09:09] <+Kaito_Cam> Janemba would be nice
[2:09:09] <extradopeness> EX SNEEZES
[2:09:10] <Sandro2584> @cegold You mean in the movie thats not canon
[2:09:19] <%Wool> For reference, Eagle is located in the UK
[2:09:20] <MonstrousVisage> y'all if you see a gap in the line, move up
[2:09:25] <Sol_Install> the purple can be kefla or janamba
[2:09:28] <Prism_Wing> If we get Launch, we finally get GUN in the game Kappa
[2:09:31] <Sol_Install> janemba*
[2:09:34] <%vjcruzer> Janemba would also be nice
[2:09:34] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 Yeah that movie
[2:09:35] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GONNA DIE!!!!
[2:09:35] <zackmuffin> Where’s my boy raditz at
[2:09:38] <Vashido22> I'm putting my money on Raditz and Kefla as a saiyan pack
[2:09:41] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> ^
[2:09:46] <Vashido22> Since Raditz should be totally coming
[2:09:48] <%Greatnumber> yooo Raditz
[2:09:55] <%Greatnumber> woolieYE
[2:09:56] <KantusMonkus> i really want janemba
[2:09:58] <%NumberTooBig> @Prism_Wing what about that frieza move from the movie
[2:10:00] <Sol_Install> Team sayian saga would be nice to have
[2:10:00] <+FierceDeityGabriel> I want child Raditz from the movie
[2:10:01] <Vashido22> Raditz is the only character left from Extreme Butoden to make it
[2:10:03] <gottigotbundles> UUB
[2:10:04] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Raditz should've been in AT LAUNCH
[2:10:04] <KantusMonkus> but its not gonna happen :c
[2:10:04] <Sandro2584> I still want hercule
[2:10:10] <Sol_Install> Raditz, Vegata and Nappa would be fun
[2:10:11] <ofalconer> For more ladies Chi Chi would be awesome
[2:10:11] <ARBITERWARPIG> BRING BACK UUB
[2:10:16] <+LastHazzerd> BELL~!
[2:10:22] <ECRead> @WoolieVersus can we address these roustabouts that went and made a 2nd line?
[2:10:29] <+Dewitt1998> <3
[2:10:30] <Sol_Install> Chichi is a fighter and she has been in a fighting game before so yes
[2:10:32] <Prism_Wing> @numbertoobig que?
[2:10:33] <ZeSmexyHabib> Pats on that hour donating spree again, so I'm here watching FeelsGoodMan
[2:10:36] <Sol_Install> please put chichi in
[2:10:38] <CNightmare072> Yo couch, what would YOU think if it was Super Buu/Buuhan?? I feel like he would be really fun & was the best looking/interesting Buu form
[2:10:39] <%Greatnumber> Ox KING
[2:10:49] <extradopeness> Launch in DBFZ introducing SNEEZE CANCELLING
[2:10:50] <%NumberTooBig> yeah, remember, Maximillian was shot that one time
[2:10:56] <%NumberTooBig> Kappa
[2:10:59] <Prism_Wing> @extradopeness PogChamp PogChamp
[2:10:59] <+jayfigga> Wait pat hasn’t played monster hunter yet?
[2:11:01] <%Menitta> too bad EAGLE RUINED IT
[2:11:04] <ECRead> IT WOULD BE WOULDNT IT
[2:11:05] <+gael_jebidibah> My vote is for ARALE
[2:11:05] <%Greatnumber> Sneeze to style switch
[2:11:05] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus How bad was the connection? considering i have your stream open and am from england
[2:11:09] <blackjackskellington> time to take a piss
[2:11:09] <KeiPrime> Ranfan for dbfz
[2:11:15] <ARBITERWARPIG> Remember the days of getting stabbed for throwing dudes in SF2
[2:11:16] <DrkJP520> Raditz is the only Extreme Butoden character that's not in FighterZ yet
[2:11:20] <Sandro2584> Super buu was definetly the best version of buu
[2:11:31] <ARBITERWARPIG> Fat Buu*
[2:11:32] <Rikui_> SKIPPIN THE LINE I SEE THAT SwiftRage
[2:11:33] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Raditz is totally coming. The last character from Extreme Butoden to be adapted into FighterZ. Super high chances of coming
[2:11:33] <ZaibatsuFan> Pat is currently reading messages, flubbing only some of his words.
[2:11:34] <Run44forrest> that connection oof
[2:11:37] <%Greatnumber> I still have the stab wounds
[2:11:37] <+Pat_Squared> @WoolieVersus except some asses decided to make a second line
[2:11:38] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> GT
[2:11:40] <%NumberTooBig> @Sandro2584 don't know about that one chief
[2:11:40] <+FierceDeityGabriel> GT DansGame
[2:11:41] <MyNameIsRasus> I want Hercule
[2:11:42] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> shotoEww shotoEww shotoEww
[2:11:44] <exalt4747> Raditz would not be a good pick imo.
[2:11:49] <%Greatnumber> Satan
[2:11:49] <gottigotbundles> ss4 goku
[2:11:51] <drefizz> GT is ok
[2:11:51] <Sol_Install> GT doesn't count in canon
[2:11:59] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> GT doodBenny
[2:12:00] <Vashido22> @exalt4747 He is coming tho, and he can end up being fun af
[2:12:01] <Toastpoints> SSJ4 is the only thing worthwhile from GT
[2:12:03] <LucidInDarkness> Super Buu best buu...because he was a straight dick of a villain LUL
[2:12:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Mr Satan deserves his spot in this roster
[2:12:13] <drefizz> Finding the dragon balls in GT was stupid
[2:12:14] <danknugglit> Beyblade tho
[2:12:21] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Master Roshi has to be in he's an OG
[2:12:22] <KeiPrime> but omega shenron tho
[2:12:22] <Sol_Install> GT had nice ideas: SSJ4, shadow dragons, and Machine mutants but outside of that nothing else
[2:12:25] <ECRead> FUCK IT I guess I'm getting in the new line
[2:12:27] <exalt4747> @Vashido22: I mean, the latter point is at least true. I didn't care for Jiren but I like playing him.
[2:12:29] <%CEGold> SSJ4 > SSB and I will die on that hill
[2:12:29] <%ventus_fury> Why do you think that this pass is so cheap? We are getting our joke characters in :3
[2:12:30] <Sandro2584> Super buu has more character and was way more enteratining even in the comedy bits than fat buu or kid buu
[2:12:31] <DoctorDerpoTron23> baby Vegeta was also good
[2:12:32] <%Greatnumber> And they are making SSJ4 half canon
[2:12:32] <Run44forrest> Piccolo PogChamp
[2:12:36] <+DrZhivago311> I like guessing which line is correct
[2:12:36] <blackjackskellington> oh my god i forgot bout SSJ4 Goku. hed beballer
[2:12:41] <gottigotbundles> baby vegeta was better than goku black
[2:12:41] <%Fiend95> Tien PogChamp
[2:12:43] <TheBrunoZone> Well, now I know how bad the connection is from where I live, even with a SEPARATED WIRED ONE. I think I'll pass
[2:12:51] <drefizz> @Pyr0_Fr0st problem is Roshi cant fly and super dash is flying to a degree
[2:12:59] <Vashido22> One of the dlc images has a brown background
[2:13:01] <drefizz> Unless Roshi gets a jetpack
[2:13:05] <Vashido22> Who else can be but Raditz?
[2:13:05] <Run44forrest> yeyeye
[2:13:14] <exalt4747> Heck, I was more excited for Cooler than 17, but I liked 17 better to play...rip
[2:13:15] <ManOfReason> No more loops :(
[2:13:16] <+nharliecash> roshi can use the nimbus
[2:13:21] <KeiPrime> hel yea piccolo
[2:13:22] <%NumberTooBig> @Vashido22 Yajirobe with mist finer Kappa
[2:13:24] <+LordOffel> wait roshi can use nimbus
[2:13:24] <zackmuffin> @drefizz or gamera
[2:13:27] <exalt4747> Toppo is brown.
[2:13:28] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 What would his super be since Kid Buu poached his special?
[2:13:32] <Vashido22> @NumberTooBig LUL
[2:13:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Roshi uses a Kamehameha to boost himself
[2:13:45] <zackmuffin> @lordoffel nope
[2:13:47] <Vashido22> helloooo
[2:13:50] <Sol_Install> @gottigotbundles in a world that was prefect how cool would it be to have a baby vegeta and goku black fuse into gogeta and/or vegito?
[2:13:54] <Aubreon> roshu can't use nimbus bc he doesn't have a pure heart
[2:13:55] <ARBITERWARPIG> Goku did that too
[2:13:58] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> If we're getting a joke character it 100% has to be Mr. Satan
[2:14:00] <+LordOffel> @zackmuffin oh shit you right mb mb
[2:14:03] <%Greatnumber> Cooler is being Cool
[2:14:05] <Sol_Install> We don't know
[2:14:09] <+FierceDeityGabriel> In non canon land

[2:14:17] <Sol_Install> Cooler is non canon at the moment
[2:14:18] <drefizz> not canon
[2:14:19] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Cooler isn't canon
[2:14:20] <KeiPrime> movie characters dont have shit man
[2:14:20] <+unbARECKable> being non canon
[2:14:21] <DrkJP520> Coola is dead like a bitch

[2:14:27] <godzookylives> Probably Space boarding school
[2:14:27] <+DrZhivago311> i think left line is the one
[2:14:27] <%CEGold> not canon unfortunately
[2:14:32] <Sk8t3> not canon
[2:14:33] <RadShiro> Cooler is NOT CANON and he has his OWN FORCE if you want something
[2:14:35] <+GreatestGuess> Nothing because he isn’t canon
[2:14:38] <businesscasualninja> SO SAD
[2:14:38] <brionicman> gettin swole
[2:14:38] <drefizz> he was being non canon
[2:14:40] <gottigotbundles> @soul_bruce_lee that's a great timeline to live in. but would he have a British accent
[2:14:42] <EnderGamma> He's up to not existing
[2:14:42] <%Greatnumber> @WoolieVersus He's somewhere being cooler than you
[2:14:44] <ARBITERWARPIG> HE WASNT DOING JACK SHIT
[2:14:46] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Conquering other shitty planets @woolieversus
[2:14:46] <+TaylorTot> I wish the line wanted to play while waiting lol
[2:14:47] <exalt4747> I wonder if they will ever consider giving Cooler the Broly treatment
[2:14:47] <+Haarute> Well I think they all ruled over different places or whatever.
[2:14:47] <MyNameIsRasus> HE WAS BEATING OFF
[2:14:50] <+VektorTroika> he can't be up to anything because he isn't real
[2:14:50] <Champ96dp> He was fapping
[2:14:50] <spardanwarrior> Laughing about how much of a bitch Frieza is.
[2:14:50] <KeiPrime> jackin it
[2:14:51] <ECRead> Cooler was busy making a 2nd line :)
[2:14:52] <Red_Comet_Tyson> the frezzer apliance families are space pirates
[2:14:53] <+badmr7> He was watching the saiyin planet from a ship as Frieza blew it up
[2:14:56] <Sol_Install> Cooler being cool on a planet of rocks
[2:14:56] <Run44forrest> cooler ResidentSleeper METAL COOLER PogChamp
[2:14:58] <Sk8t3> in the Woolie Hole
[2:14:58] <danknugglit> Vaping?
[2:14:59] <Luvinsus> Actually nothing, he went to Earth for revenge once Freeza died
[2:15:02] <+Kaito_Cam> he's not canon therfore he was doing nothing
[2:15:02] <%CEGold> Wasn't there a referennce to Cooler in the Broly movie?
[2:15:03] <Firemane1279> He was fucking all the women. Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:15:04] <+badmr7> Supposedly let Goku's pod fly off
[2:15:05] <%ventus_fury> Opening a room a bit mid through the line then
[2:15:12] <blackjackskellington> not helping him cause they hate eachother
[2:15:14] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Big Spaghetti Star
[2:15:15] <%NumberTooBig> finding a pgene therepy clinic for getting a sick head piece
[2:15:16] <%Skullgod> no there was a reference to tarbles not cooler
[2:15:18] <Sandro2584> @cegold Maybe absorbing Gotenks for 3 bars and then Gohan for 5 bars
[2:15:20] <lovesosa236> people worry about canon like the dragon ball story is actually good
[2:15:20] <$KnivesEve> if broly is canon now, you never know with cooler now
[2:15:21] <drefizz> @Firemane1279 how? he doesnt have a weewee
[2:15:22] <exalt4747> serengeti star
[2:15:24] <battlebeast67> No it's called the Cooler Coalition
[2:15:29] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> He doesn't care about Frieza
[2:15:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Big Ghetto Star
[2:15:30] <Sol_Install> @KnivesEve true
[2:15:32] <extradopeness> I thought he said that shit too Reggie
[2:15:32] <ARBITERWARPIG> Not the same Broly
[2:15:36] <%Greatnumber> He could have a robo dick
[2:15:43] <lovesosa236> who cares what's canon it's not like dbz has the deepest story
[2:15:44] <MonstrousVisage> damn this games got long ass matches I thought it was 3 already
[2:15:50] <+Dewitt1998> I thought it was one and done
[2:15:52] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 If you miss it you get Piccolo? Kappa
[2:15:56] <zackmuffin> Cooler was in his edgey teenage phase so he was ignoring his dad
[2:15:59] <+GunterDriger6> back to 1 line
[2:15:59] <+Raidou24> I love how Tarble is cannon but Cooler isn't
[2:16:05] <gottigotbundles> old line died
[2:16:06] <+Raidou24> canon*
[2:16:08] <Sol_Install> no
[2:16:08] <%Skullgod> no
[2:16:09] <ARBITERWARPIG> Noooope
[2:16:09] <%Greatnumber> no
[2:16:10] <%CEGold> Nope
[2:16:11] <drefizz> nope
[2:16:12] <+Dewitt1998> NOPE
[2:16:12] <dragonslayingronin> nope
[2:16:13] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Not really
[2:16:14] <+LastHazzerd> not really
[2:16:15] <Vashido22> Nope
[2:16:16] <zaptar13> no
[2:16:18] <MyNameIsRasus> nope
[2:16:18] <+Dewitt1998> You see Freiza in hell and that's it
[2:16:18] <pwnhills> They never will
[2:16:20] <exalt4747> NOPE
[2:16:21] <Sol_Install> Chill
[2:16:23] <drefizz> Frost
[2:16:23] <ARBITERWARPIG> We still don't know what Frieza's race is
[2:16:23] <godzookylives> Frost
[2:16:23] <+Dewitt1998> Frieza*
[2:16:24] <Vashido22> I mean, there's Frost
[2:16:26] <Sandro2584> @cegold Yes piccolo whiff cancels lmao
[2:16:26] <Sol_Install> Frost*
[2:16:26] <+chronopaladin> frieza's a genetic freak, like scott steiner
[2:16:28] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Alt Universe Frieza
[2:16:30] <Luvinsus> Frost, he's from universe 6
[2:16:30] <ARBITERWARPIG> That's Frost
[2:16:31] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> They're just called Frieza race so there's like no info
[2:16:31] <+LastHazzerd> parallel freeza
[2:16:34] <exalt4747> BROLY had more Frieza lore than super
[2:16:36] <%aishman> That's Frost, it's Freeza from another dimension
[2:16:36] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Frost is from another universe
[2:16:41] <DrkJP520> Cooler flies around space talking shit about his little brother, saying how he underestimated his opponent and died. and then he flies to earth, underestimates Goku's power, and dies like a bitch.
[2:16:44] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Oh ho ho ho ho
[2:16:45] <+Dewitt1998> Freiza from another world
[2:16:46] <MyNameIsRasus> From another Universe
[2:16:46] <dragonslayingronin> frost is just sneaky frieza and also is mega bitchmade.
[2:16:49] <lovesosa236> people so serious lol chill
[2:16:50] <%Greatnumber> They talk about him from the other universe who is a Defender of their universe. But his shit isn't talked about at all.
[2:16:55] <Sol_Install> Actually, thinking about it, Frost could be in the line up since it's a purple slot
[2:16:56] <dylansiebenhar> yeah my nigga
[2:16:56] <ARBITERWARPIG> Universe 6 is weird
[2:16:57] <KeiPrime> frieza in an isekai
[2:17:04] <+bonzosan> frost demons are their names i guess
[2:17:06] <reiju_22> friezas race is called frieza race Kappa
[2:17:08] <+RowenCleric> piiiiiicooooloooo
[2:17:10] <drefizz> @lovesosa236 serious? this isnt even our final forms?
[2:17:11] <+LastHazzerd> Picalloooooo
[2:17:11] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Frieza Race[6] (フリーザ種族 Furīza shuzoku) is the mysterious race that Frieza, King Cold, Cooler, Kuriza, Frost and Chilled belong to. The race is first introduced in the series in the Namek Saga of Dragon Ball Z. The species have been referred to as the Frost Demons[7] and Friezas[5] colloquially. In Dragon Ball Fusions, they are considered part of the Alien race.
[2:17:14] <KeiPrime> i cant believe this monkey destroyed my empire!!
[2:17:14] <exalt4747> Frost was much more secretive than Frieza, so as a result, both Frost and the U6 saiyans weremuch weaker
[2:17:18] <Sol_Install> and the auburn is Kefla
[2:17:20] <%Menitta> This line is terrible
[2:17:20] <%Cavumentum> Only that Frieza in the Frieza saga was literally no training Frieza, and that his species' baseline was absurdly strong, also that if you die on Earth you go to Earth's Hell.
[2:17:23] <%Menitta> its illegible lol
[2:17:24] <extradopeness> _/_/
[2:17:26] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Frieza's race is Uniqua
[2:17:27] <drefizz> Oh right Frieza has a child...
[2:17:34] <%Greatnumber> The purple slot is Android 15 Kappa
[2:17:38] <exalt4747> Also if a Cell or Buu situation ever happened, they might have just hired Hit to deal with it
[2:17:40] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Ice Cube is part of the Frieza Race
[2:17:43] <ARBITERWARPIG> YEAH REMEMBER WHEN FRIEZA HAD A KID
[2:17:50] <%CEGold> I want DBE Goku and DBE Oozaru to be the next DLC Kappa woolieGASM
[2:17:58] <Sandro2584> OH GOD HE DID HAVE A KID
[2:18:00] <theziggystar> @woolieversus What fighting game(s) do you have the most love/hate relationship with?
[2:18:04] <$konekoryugamine> YEAH YEAH YEAH!
[2:18:09] <%NumberTooBig> considering that soul calibur leak, think there's code names in this version too
[2:18:09] <+McSoliace> jesus

[2:18:23] <dragonslayingronin> jenemba is the one everyone wants
[2:18:24] <$konekoryugamine> That's something I always wanted to know.
[2:18:25] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> SS3 Vegeta
[2:18:27] <KeiPrime> wheres turles
[2:18:27] <TigerClaws12> or 21

[2:18:29] <godzookylives> Lord Slug
[2:18:30] <Sandro2584> Janemba or Slug would be great
[2:18:31] <%tomokocchi_> Lord Slug
[2:18:32] <extradopeness> KURIZA!!!
[2:18:37] <TigerClaws12> 21 better be canon 😡
[2:18:38] <dragonslayingronin> jenemba is basically the only other movie character that matters.
[2:18:39] <blackjackskellington> SUPER 13
[2:18:42] <$konekoryugamine> @Greatnumber Oh, really? I always thought it was something involving tails.
[2:18:42] <Nitsuj293> Like Cooler Keepo
[2:18:43] <ARBITERWARPIG> HIRUDEGARN WHEN
[2:18:43] <KeiPrime> or theat green chick. zangya?
[2:18:45] <+unbARECKable> @WoolieVersus Why bother with Janemba when Bojack exists? :P
[2:18:45] <lovesosa236> I wouldnt imagine GT until Fighterz 2
[2:18:46] <+Ramzilla8> Is anyone allowed to join?
[2:18:48] <$konekoryugamine> But thanks, though.
[2:18:53] <RadShiro> Hell the Bardock in game isnt canon anymor either
[2:18:56] <ManOfReason> @WoolieVersus what was your favorite fight in dbz or super?
[2:18:59] <+McSoliace> im not even yajirobe
[2:18:59] <exalt4747> @blackjackskellington TRUCKER HAT
[2:19:01] <Sandro2584> Turles could be really interesting with his fruit thing too
[2:19:02] <Rikui_> yeah thank you woolie
[2:19:05] <+Tarkara> Jenemba is one of the strongest decks in the Super TCG at the moment
[2:19:09] <drefizz> I keep forgetting Paikuhan isnt cannon
[2:19:12] <ARBITERWARPIG> WHERE'S TAPION AT
[2:19:14] <$konekoryugamine> Wait, so, does this mean the Namekians are androgenous and therefore all beings lay the eggs?
[2:19:15] <%CEGold> @RadShiro Don't remind me NotLikeThis
[2:19:15] <exalt4747> Turles is the absolute last character that should get in.
[2:19:16] <stircrazzy> im in Cali that sounds like alot of Delay to me lol
[2:19:19] <+Ramzilla8> PS4 or PC?
[2:19:22] <Run44forrest> I hate how they say beerus made frieza blow up planet vegeta in super
[2:19:23] <MyNameIsRasus> Just get in line som
[2:19:26] <+Irridium> why'd the line have to move to the middle where it's hard to see who's next
[2:19:27] <Agent_Sampson> Is the old line the wrong line now? !_!
[2:19:28] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Canada, East Coast. Meeting Lobby 4
[2:19:28] <$konekoryugamine> I have too many questions.
[2:19:29] <MyNameIsRasus> son*
[2:19:30] <RealPT1> I think the plot of xenoverse 2 was the movie villains trying to become canon
[2:19:31] <DrkJP520> There's not even a line anymore. Everyone left the original line and jumbled together into a big ol' gay pile
[2:19:32] <%tomokocchi_> add Dabura
[2:19:33] <ARBITERWARPIG> @konekoryugamine yeah
[2:19:37] <Sk8t3> the line is FACKD
[2:19:41] <TigerClaws12> THE BABY
[2:19:42] <ARBITERWARPIG> BRING BACK BAHY
[2:19:43] <KeiPrime> wheres stinky lord bacterian
[2:19:44] <$konekoryugamine> And there goes the fangirl side of my brain.
[2:19:45] <MyNameIsRasus> Tapion
[2:19:46] <CNightmare072> Omega Shenron for last DLC slot Kappa
[2:19:47] <ARBITERWARPIG> BABY WAS COOL
[2:19:48] <dragonslayingronin> s3 is going to be the gt season just watch
[2:19:49] <+VektorTroika> Baby
[2:19:49] <$KnivesEve> omega shenron should be in season 2
[2:19:49] <%CEGold> @RealPT1 That's a hilariously accurate way to phrase that!
[2:19:50] <Sandro2584> @run44forrest nah frieza just asked beerus for his permission to destroy vegeta
[2:19:51] <%Halowood> SS4 is the best form, fight me
[2:19:51] <godzookylives> Baby Vegeta For season 2
[2:19:52] <$konekoryugamine> BABY CAN SUCK IT.
[2:19:53] <+gael_jebidibah> SUPER BABY
[2:19:55] <$cherubsanonymous> Probably because most of these characters are really bad and not memorable
[2:19:56] <shodoblanka1> Kid Goku
[2:19:56] <+VektorTroika> OMEGA
[2:19:57] <%vjcruzer> Turles is so far at the bottom of most I could think of
[2:20:02] <ARBITERWARPIG> BABY WAS THE BEST ARC IN GT
[2:20:03] <Sol_Install> M U S T A C H E
[2:20:03] <Sandro2584> FUCK BABY
[2:20:03] <$konekoryugamine> OH MY GOD I FORGOT VEGETA HAD THE PORN STASH
[2:20:04] <+damnitmcgarnicle> I currently suck at this game but im down to get back into the swing of it. If it means playing against them at a later date.
[2:20:04] <+unbARECKable> I would love SS4 Gogeta to be in FighterZ
[2:20:06] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Driving episode
[2:20:10] <+Ramzilla8> Fuck, just realized this is on ps4 and not on PC
[2:20:12] <zackmuffin> Hey everything in gt was cool on paper
[2:20:13] <+Ramzilla8> Feels bad
[2:20:14] <exalt4747> GT let Vegeta grow more than super did
[2:20:15] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> SS1 Goku vs Frieza
[2:20:16] <Gutsandlove> Worst hair, best mustache
[2:20:16] <%Skullgod> Triple tag team vs Jiren
[2:20:16] <reiju_22> D:
[2:20:17] <Sol_Install> rooKek
[2:20:17] <%CEGold> Pikkon vs Olibu or Piccolo vs 17
[2:20:19] <+Irridium> goku and piccolo driving cars
[2:20:22] <KeiPrime> krillin remembers he doesnt have a nose, and beats bacterian
[2:20:22] <drefizz> Broly movie fight
[2:20:22] <TigerClaws12> piccolo getting his driving license
[2:20:22] <$konekoryugamine> @WoolieVersus Best moment of Dragon Ball for me? WHEN CELL FUCKING PUNCHED HERCULE ACROSS THE FACE!
[2:20:23] <SephirKath> Goku learning to drive a CAR
[2:20:23] <CNightmare072> Vegeta giving up his pride for his kids. 100% best moment & sold me on Vegeta.
[2:20:24] <%ventus_fury> What happened to the line?
[2:20:24] <dirtyplebian> Tien fuckin up cell
[2:20:26] <Sandro2584> PICCOLO VS 17
[2:20:26] <Prism_Wing> wut we need is kid Krillin Kappa
[2:20:27] <+McSoliace> tien vs cell
[2:20:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Gohan's SS2 transformation
[2:20:28] <drefizz> Oh god
[2:20:28] <Run44forrest> krillin hitting goku with a rock
[2:20:29] <+unbARECKable> When Gohan takes over for Goku at the end of the Cell Saga
[2:20:29] <%ventus_fury> I had a match and DAMN
[2:20:33] <extradopeness> Ginyu becoming afroge
[2:20:34] <ManOfReason> Piccolo killing both raditz and goku
[2:20:35] <ECRead> nu Broly
[2:20:36] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> The Kai version
[2:20:36] <shodoblanka1> Tree of life
[2:20:36] <blackjackskellington> Frieza, 17,Goku vs. Jiren
[2:20:37] <%CEGold> IT WAS UNNECESSARY TOO!! IT ADDED NOTHING TO THE SAGA
[2:20:40] <DrkJP520> Goku kicks Drum's face in.
[2:20:40] <gottigotbundles> Super gets away with a lot of b.s.
[2:20:42] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Videl looking at the energy in Gohans hands. intense
[2:20:44] <Sol_Install> Goku going SSj3
[2:20:44] <KeiPrime> tien holding down cell with the tri beam
[2:20:45] <zackmuffin> Tien vs cell
[2:20:46] <SomersaultJustice> when kid goku first fought Yamcha
[2:20:46] <KunPeng21> gohan ssj2
[2:20:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Video learns ki
[2:20:48] <$konekoryugamine> I'm telling you now, Cell PIMP SLAPPING HERCULE IS THE FUCKING BEST MOMEN
[2:20:53] <%Greatnumber> Goku Kamehameha vs Vegeta's Big Bang Attack on earth during the Saiyan saga, and pretty much that entire fucking fight.
[2:20:55] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Warp Kamehameha on Cell is the BEST moment in DBZ
[2:20:56] <%jinking79> then they make a doujin
[2:20:57] <+GrayFox621> the honor system doesn't work why is woolie doing a 1v1 ring?
[2:20:59] <%spicecrisis> Gotta love that Toriyama
[2:20:59] <Rikui_> @ventus_fury people are skipping the line
[2:21:05] <Doc1790> Gohan Vs. Cell Kamehameha Clash is my favorite moment
[2:21:06] <ARBITERWARPIG> Goku vs Vegeta is the best fight in the franchise.
[2:21:09] <Sandro2584> Also majin veget vs goku
[2:21:19] <+chronopaladin> goku was trying to push videl to go super saiyan 2
[2:21:21] <+gael_jebidibah> Oh no THAT doujin
[2:21:22] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Trunks killing 17 and 18 is satisfying @woolieversus
[2:21:23] <%CEGold> If you move Spopovich vs Videl to after Gohan vs Kibito, the story proceeds EXACTLY the same
[2:21:25] <$konekoryugamine> DAMN this is dirty!
[2:21:26] <+ryujinran> i'm sure spopvich is going to to be the next dlc
[2:21:32] <3xgilly> whenever goku eats
[2:21:37] <JetpackMcQuack> Videl learns ki
[2:21:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Vegeta's sacrifice is also good
[2:21:40] <extradopeness> Its always the one armed Kamehaha at the end of Cell Saga
[2:21:41] <TheBrunoZone> I'm only concerned about what was going on in Toriyama's head in that specific moment
[2:21:42] <%ventus_fury> I see, but the line has just moved everywhere from the 4 minute match i had lol
[2:21:53] <KeiPrime> vegeta murders zarbon
[2:21:54] <ARBITERWARPIG> That's the point
[2:21:59] <Nayafer91> @WoolieVersus use the others team slots and set the 3 teams for faster team swich and speed up the selection. :)
[2:22:01] <CNightmare072> Vegeta 100% letting go & sacrificing himself got Trunks was so good
[2:22:06] <BestTeaMaker> what just happened
[2:22:08] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Vegita is John Wick
[2:22:08] <Sol_Install> That talk with Goku and Majin Vegeta was so great
[2:22:09] <ARBITERWARPIG> There's a fan manga about that
[2:22:12] <Run44forrest> bardock fights were pretty cool
[2:22:16] <+Emperor_Bad> redeemed raditz would just hang with yamcha all day
[2:22:21] <%Fiend95> Producer Nappa from DBZA
[2:22:22] <TigerClaws12> nappa's a hollywood manager now wdym? Kappa
[2:22:23] <BwdYeti> just wish them back
[2:22:24] <%Greatnumber> Raditz would probably be with Marron
[2:22:25] <reiju_22> yes but no one wants them around LUL
[2:22:25] <KawaiiRaptor2> Unmei No Hi
[2:22:26] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> in the show, vegeta said he got a family with the express purpose of becoming super saiyan
[2:22:26] <+DestroyerPhoenix> we need to see super saiyan nappa with his yellow mustache
[2:22:27] <$konekoryugamine> "Not to mention Zarbon used up all my Skype minutes talking to his girlfriend, WHOM I AM CONVINCED IS NAMED CHUCK!"
[2:22:27] <GeltonZ> I wanna see Uncle Raditz the baby sitter for Goten.
[2:22:28] <Laironx3> Dabura or whatever he was called gets sent to heaven
[2:22:31] <JetpackMcQuack> Trunks avenges his timeline
[2:22:31] <drefizz> Theres a fan manga of Raditz having a family
[2:22:32] <pirateofpie> Now, Vegeta is arguably better person by now lol
[2:22:32] <+twohitgood> masakoX talks about this
[2:22:33] <extradopeness> That was the point i knew it couldn't top itself again
[2:22:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Producer Nappa is my boy
[2:22:36] <theziggystar> I think all moments are great but one the comes to mind is Vegeta getting back at Beerus for slapping Bulma.
[2:22:40] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Gotenks vs Hitler best fight
[2:22:40] <ARBITERWARPIG> That was the Janwmba movie
[2:22:41] <+gael_jebidibah> Vegeta IS the saiyan prince
[2:22:42] <%CEGold> @WoolieVersus The tenkaichi games had a what-if where Raditz hits his head and forgets he was evil
[2:22:46] <pirateofpie> *better person than Goku
[2:22:52] <$konekoryugamine> I'm just gonna start spouting BS quotes from DBZ abdirged
[2:22:52] <KeiPrime> when freiza ate that crab
[2:22:52] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Future Gohan vs The androids
[2:22:57] <Sandro2584> Oh god i forgot about super 17
[2:22:58] <drefizz> LUL
[2:23:01] <shodoblanka1> Where’s Raditz
[2:23:01] <3xgilly> YAAAAAS
[2:23:01] <+chronopaladin> nappa should've had super saiyan eyebrows
[2:23:03] <%jinking79> Kefla and Raditz next dlc
[2:23:04] <Vashido22> LUL
[2:23:08] <%Greatnumber> Let's NEVER talk about that again!
[2:23:13] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Old Kai is "dead" though
[2:23:14] <ARBITERWARPIG> WHEN'S OMEGA SHENRON
[2:23:16] <+DestroyerPhoenix> damn 18 that's savage
[2:23:21] <+damnitmcgarnicle> @WoolieVersus We dont all like to dance!
[2:23:25] <%spicecrisis> I love Super 17 and that dumb shit
[2:23:26] <%Cavumentum> @WoolieVersus Sometimes I think about how funny it is that Raditz is so weak simply because he didn't get himself beat down all the time
[2:23:26] <YeezusPieces1> Gohan/Goku Kamehameha killing Cell will always be the GOAT DB moment to me
[2:23:27] <Luvinsus> He offered to do that before the Tournament of Power, but they didn't have enough time @WoolieVersus
[2:23:29] <%CEGold> I'm still trying to figure out why Future Gohan and Trunks never got Zenkai boosts from their fights with the Androids cmonBruh
[2:23:31] <shodoblanka1> King Cold next DLC
[2:23:32] <drefizz> I honestly dont really find omega that cool
[2:23:35] <%tomokocchi_> I want to see a SSJ3 Nappa. Would he just have a super long mustache?
[2:23:41] <+nharliecash> guru also gave krillin and gohan a potential boost on namek
[2:23:41] <Aubreon> @woolieversus GGs y'all
[2:23:42] <Nitsuj293> Gates are nuts on their own
[2:23:42] <Twon_From_Wakanda> F+uck Pat! Super 17 is cool AF!
[2:23:43] <+VektorTroika> NNNNNEGATIVE ENERGY...THAT WAS COVERING THE EARTH
[2:23:44] <+a_deadbeat> Hell yeah Omega Shenron. Give me that NEGATIVE ENERGY
[2:23:49] <%Skullgod> Monster PogChamp Carrot PogChamp
[2:24:08] <%ventus_fury> I guess i'm giving up on this line business o3o
[2:24:15] <%ventus_fury> I"m gonna go spend my zeni n coins
[2:24:15] <drefizz> My favorite moments of db are whenever Nappa appeared with hair
[2:24:16] <MyNameIsRasus> Reminder that Might Guy is the baddest motherfucker in the Naruto universe
[2:24:21] <Laironx3> Gohan pulls out a legendary sword and it breaks. I think. Was that even a real episode?
[2:24:21] <%CEGold> @Twon_From_Wakanda The fact that his saga was the shortest is criminal
[2:24:26] <$KnivesEve> cheer50
[2:24:28] <+bonzosan> it's like kaioken, give everyone that power
[2:24:32] <%vjcruzer> super 17 is a cool look but one of the weirdest things ever
[2:24:34] <ARBITERWARPIG> Because he's human
[2:24:42] <ofalconer> Wouldn't the bean rot in your mouth after a while? Or do they stay fresh forever?
[2:24:43] <ARBITERWARPIG> and they are very hard to grow
[2:24:45] <+VektorTroika> this saiyan eatin BERANS
[2:24:46] <DrkJP520> Senzu are limited
[2:24:47] <Agent_Sampson> @vjcruzer he has no eyebrows LUL
[2:24:50] <JetpackMcQuack> What if vegeta spent all his training time just cutting himself like the edge lord he is, he’d be so strong
[2:24:53] <extradopeness> BEANS
[2:24:56] <%tomokocchi_> add Mighty Mask as DLC, when Goten and Trunks were stacked on top of each other
[2:25:00] <+nharliecash> foam dome
[2:25:02] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @laironx3 Sure was
[2:25:03] <%CEGold> @ARBITERWARPIG Why not wish for an unlimited supply? Kappa
[2:25:04] <%Greatnumber> Gotta take the BIG GULPS
[2:25:13] <KeiPrime> dead rising 2 has that
[2:25:17] <KeiPrime> the sippy hat
[2:25:18] <+DestroyerPhoenix> the prince is a dumbass
[2:25:21] <+gael_jebidibah> Farm them
[2:25:24] <ARBITERWARPIG> Because Toriyama doesn't care
[2:25:28] <drefizz> #1 hat that shit
[2:25:32] <%Greatnumber> I wish for a bag of unlimited senzu's!
[2:25:32] <$konekoryugamine> Dude, the Senzu bean is the fucking biggest WTF I have ever seen in anime.
[2:25:32] <+Kaito_Cam> Nah just replace your blood with estus
[2:25:34] <+nharliecash> only the cat can grow senzu
[2:25:38] <Sandro2584> Why not just wish for senzu bean juice to be your blood
[2:25:39] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Kami needed a hydroponic setup
[2:25:41] <+Tarkara> it doesnt matter how many senzus goku has if he never remembers to bring them
[2:25:43] <$konekoryugamine> HOw the hell does it even work?!
[2:25:43] <CNightmare072> SENZU GUM lmao
[2:25:44] <chambatron> POCKET SAND = POCKET JELLYBEANS
[2:25:51] <Cobaltor_252> create a planet of immortals
[2:25:52] <%Greatnumber> Well isn't the reason why Yajirobe so fat because he always eats the Senzu's because that's all they have up in Korrin's place?
[2:25:53] <zackmuffin> Shenron doesn’t support cheats
[2:25:54] <+Kaito_Cam> Yeah but like frieza said that ruins the fun
[2:25:56] <danknugglit> Senzuroids
[2:25:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Remember when people used to want to wish for immortality
[2:26:01] <ARBITERWARPIG> THIS SAIYAN EATIN BEANS
[2:26:02] <%CEGold> @Tarkara That's why Piccolo will be incharge of them
[2:26:07] <KeiPrime> i mean jojo has senzu beans, they're called crazy diamond, gold experience, f.f.
[2:26:08] <+VektorTroika> Soylent, but it's made with senzu beans
[2:26:11] <$konekoryugamine> Dude I would LOVE to see a Saiyan dude a fucking "POCKET SAND!" on their opponent
[2:26:15] <ZeSmexyHabib> Not even that, fucking capsule.corp could just make more artificially. LuL
[2:26:16] <+unbARECKable> a senzu that infinitely regenerates
[2:26:16] <DrkJP520> You can't just chow down on senzu 24/7. They also fill you up for 10 days. You'd die.
[2:26:17] <$konekoryugamine> WHOS WITH ME
[2:26:17] <%Skullgod> "Why dont we just cheat" - Woolie
[2:26:22] <Laironx3> @Soul_Bruce_Lee Thanks.
[2:26:24] <+Kaito_Cam> Senzu Patch
[2:26:25] <+DestroyerPhoenix> Journal entry: things have gone to hell ever since frieza got ahold of the senzu beans
[2:26:26] <+Tarkara> bitterOK
[2:26:29] <+Emperor_Bad> why have immortality when you could have beans
[2:26:38] <$konekoryugamine> Woolie, NO
[2:26:39] <Run44forrest> everyone gets one (1) senzu
[2:26:39] <JetpackMcQuack> So many people wanted immortality, Goku should have just knocked it out for the sake of defending earth
[2:26:40] <$konekoryugamine> NO
[2:26:42] <+nharliecash> freeza had the big tank of healing fluid
[2:26:42] <+Jeebus4> Nicotine Patches only they're Senzu Patches
[2:26:43] <$konekoryugamine> STOP
[2:26:45] <+nharliecash> he didnt need senzu
[2:26:46] <$konekoryugamine> WOOLIE ON
[2:26:47] <%Greatnumber> We get fucking sage pops
[2:26:47] <YeezusPieces1> Death doesn't even matter in the DB universe.
[2:26:49] <+GunterDriger6> umm
[2:26:49] <ARBITERWARPIG> Ultra Instinct is just senzu energy
[2:26:51] <+dramajoe> coat a senzu bean in shit
[2:26:52] <TheBrunoZone> So unlimited senzu beans are chating, but inmortality gets a pass.... Aight, cool
[2:26:53] <Crankthulhu> I don't think Woolie understands how Senzu Beans work
[2:26:55] <$konekoryugamine> DAMN IT WOOGIE
[2:26:57] <extradopeness> There will be a Senzu dependency EPIDEMIC if we keep going this way
[2:26:58] <TheBrunoZone> *cheating
[2:27:01] <investorscratchit> coat it tho
[2:27:03] <%Greatnumber> Like we literally just get Sage mode pops now
[2:27:08] <brionicman> time release capsules
[2:27:09] <$konekoryugamine> Woogie . . . WOOGIE! SURE! THAT'S WHAT I FUCKING MEANT TO TYPE!
[2:27:10] <ARBITERWARPIG> Yeah
[2:27:10] <+luketrapwalker> New story twist: Senzu beans aren't vegan friendly.
[2:27:10] <thunderhog> are you eating BEANS?! lytFILTH
[2:27:12] <+Jeebus4> THIS SAIYAN EATING BEANS
[2:27:12] <%fFailureatlife> how DO senzu beans work
[2:27:12] <Zooxf> Bean dad
[2:27:14] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Kami
[2:27:16] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Korin makes them
[2:27:17] <Crankthulhu> Senzu Beans are basically the blueberry gum from Willy Wonka
[2:27:18] <wolvenelf> noe ating beans
[2:27:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> hope i can get a match in before the stream ends
[2:27:18] <ofalconer> Now I wanna see a Sayian who is addicted to senzu beans like Bane is to venom. He's constantly at 100% but deteriorates ultra fast without them
[2:27:20] <$konekoryugamine> Kami DAMN it
[2:27:23] <$FuqBoiSlim> YOU EATIN MY BEANSSSS cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh
[2:27:26] <%Greatnumber> He tried to be cool
[2:27:27] <DrkJP520> Cool cool beans, beans, cool beans!!
[2:27:28] <Laironx3> Imagine Senzu Beans being used as a cyanide capsule.
[2:27:28] <Sandro2584> Whats stupid is that frieza knows about the beans he could easily strengthen his army 20 fold by hitting a lick on korin real quick
[2:27:29] <$konekoryugamine> I forgot about Android 16
[2:27:31] <ARBITERWARPIG> WHISKERS THE WONDER CAT
[2:27:35] <JetpackMcQuack> They take a long ass time to grow
[2:27:39] <drefizz> korrin makes them when hes not making love to yajirobe
[2:27:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> What's the matter? Scared of BEANs?
[2:27:48] <%CEGold> Anyone else remember the rule that if Piccolo kills someone they can't go to the afterlife because he was a demon?
[2:27:52] <exalt4747> If Frieza went to Korin though, they'd detect his power super hard
[2:27:52] <$konekoryugamine> WHAT
[2:27:59] <$konekoryugamine> @CEGold WHAT?!
[2:28:01] <ARBITERWARPIG> OG Dragonball is the best series
[2:28:01] <Crankthulhu> A Senzu Bean brings you back o health because a single one has incredible nutritional value
[2:28:15] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> WHEN'S ZANGYA?!
[2:28:18] <Malik1002> ggz
[2:28:18] <Crankthulhu> You eat five Senzu Beans, you would literally explode like some deviantart fetish pron
[2:28:21] <extradopeness> Korin is THIS CLOSE to becoming the next Martin Shkreli
[2:28:28] <drefizz> Zangya got fucking DONE DIRTY
[2:28:34] <TheBrunoZone> @CEGold Namekian, not Demon. Remember that no one ever watched the original DB
[2:28:37] <reiju_22> chi chi and kid goku

[2:28:42] <Luvinsus> Ribrianne for DBFZ Kappa

[2:28:45] <ARBITERWARPIG> Aint that the chick from the Bojack movie?
[2:28:45] <Agent_Sampson> @drefizz #facts
[2:28:47] <KawaiiRaptor2> wait, Piccolo can Shadow Realm people?
[2:28:48] <gottigotbundles> stakes could matter again if someone killed Dende and piccolo along with blowing up namek, super dragon balls, zeno, whis. fck db has a lot of get out of jail free cards
[2:28:50] <Twon_From_Wakanda> @WoolieVersus Wait don't senzu bean just heal your injuries but don't give back your stamina?

[2:29:08] <3xgilly> SUPAH POWAH
[2:29:10] <CNightmare072> lol
[2:29:11] <Sandro2584> That movies music is so sick

[2:29:12] <drefizz> LUL
[2:29:14] <+theAncopro> FUSION FIGHTAR
[2:29:20] <+badmr7> ITs fucking rad
[2:29:20] <+Irridium> @WoolieVersus Broly's theme in DBFZ eventually just devolves into a guy shouting BROLYBROLYBROLYBROLYBROLY it's the best
[2:29:20] <%Greatnumber> AND IN THIS CORNER
[2:29:22] <%vjcruzer> along with her boss
[2:29:22] <%fFailureatlife> imagine needing a striker because you aren't able to fight on your own #android21gang

[2:29:27] <theziggystar> KA KA ROT

[2:29:45] <Run44forrest> bulma couldve wished to solve world hunger or some shit but instead wants to look 5 years younger
[2:29:48] <%Greatnumber> It's so fucking weird at first
[2:29:51] <+frankthetank285> no woolie it's a fight announcer
[2:29:55] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> DB FPS
[2:30:03] <Sandro2584> I love all the transformations in that movie
[2:30:05] <+gael_jebidibah> It's sick
[2:30:08] <Cheapheatmo> I'm not a dragon ball fan at all and I loved it
[2:30:10] <Toastpoints> the Super Broly movie is now the 3rd most popular anime move of all time behind the 1st and second pokemon movies
[2:30:12] <ECRead> it's on Youtube
[2:30:16] <%CEGold> @Run44forrest Could've been a cool character moment. Must be hard aging next to your spouse who stays younger longer than you.
[2:30:18] <%tomokocchi_> the movie was great because it turned Broly into an actual character
[2:30:19] <Dao_Puppy> Hmmm. Now I kind want to youtube that one part.
[2:30:24] <PopeFantasy> You mean when Frieza gets ragged up by brolly
[2:30:26] <%spicecrisis> Yo there is enough in that movie for new Broly not to have any of the same moves
[2:30:27] <+Irridium> @WoolieVersus YEAH BID FOR POWER I HAD THAT SHIT
[2:30:29] <Crankthulhu> @CEGold Demon King Piccolo wasn't a real demon like Dabura. He was The "Nameless Namekian's" evil half, the good half being Kami. Piccolo is technically Piccolo Jr. and doesn't have the same moral weirdness
[2:30:30] <%CEGold> BID FOR POWER woolieGASM
[2:30:31] <Sandro2584> the close up on brolys eyes
[2:30:32] <%linkwolf4> ALSO FRIEZA AND BULMA ARE JUST THE PETTIEST FUCKERS
[2:30:32] <ARBITERWARPIG> BID FOR FUCKING POWER
[2:30:35] <+nharliecash> always with the bid for power
[2:30:50] <ManOfReason> @WoolieVersus first person dragon ball makes you wonder how they aim their beams, they are so large they cover your face
[2:30:51] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Booty Kai
[2:30:51] <Run44forrest> friezas wish got me though that was funny
[2:30:52] <exalt4747> Anything that isn
[2:30:59] <exalt4747> tt finalb out or ultimate battle 22
[2:31:00] <%Paralurx> Budokai 3 tho
[2:31:03] <TigerClaws12> tenkaiichi is shit, budokai tho
[2:31:05] <+VektorTroika> Budokai 3 still dabes
[2:31:06] <%spicecrisis> god I hate Budokai
[2:31:15] <Sandro2584> @manofreason the ability to detect energy
[2:31:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> So are the Dragon Balls Dende's at this point? I lost track
[2:31:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> super is good
[2:31:27] <%Greatnumber> Hot fire take
[2:31:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's good overall
[2:31:30] <DrkJP520> Super is OK
[2:31:34] <Run44forrest> i miss saturday morning scrublords
[2:31:35] <Emdhad> super is okay
[2:31:38] <+FierceDeityGabriel> SourPls
[2:31:38] <ARBITERWARPIG> INFINITE WORLD IS BETTER THAN BUDOKAI 3
[2:31:39] <+DestroyerPhoenix> you're trash BibleThump
[2:31:39] <+nharliecash> you mean the game or the show now
[2:31:40] <%vjcruzer> Super is OK
[2:31:42] <DrkJP520> The fucking best song
[2:31:44] <KgKid51> I like super
[2:31:45] <+GenesisKnight> Calling Super trash when GT exists cmonBruh
[2:31:45] <%linkwolf4> It's ... eh?
[2:31:45] <Sandro2584> Super is ok boerdering on kinda bad
[2:31:45] <+LastHazzerd> Super is dividing
[2:31:46] <drefizz> the thing that made the broly movie good was it was written by Toriyama and fans of the series, rather than Toei and bullet points from toriyama
[2:31:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Super is tolerable
[2:31:48] <TheBrunoZone> It's decent. Let's leave it at that
[2:31:50] <Luvinsus> Super's ok, DBSuper Broly is incredible
[2:31:50] <exalt4747> I much preferred fisticuffs to scrublords
[2:31:54] <theziggystar> Super is good
[2:31:54] <pirateofpie> Broly movie justifies Super's existance
[2:31:56] <%Skullgod> Videl no he's underaged
[2:31:56] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> TIMELINES
[2:31:56] <$konekoryugamine> Anyone remember the GINYU FORCE?!
[2:32:01] <+Irridium> Super gave me Kefla so it's at least pretty okay
[2:32:02] <+pantherpiss2> feelgood song
[2:32:05] <+gael_jebidibah> Oof this song is so good
[2:32:06] <+nharliecash> if supers goal was to fix gt then it failed
[2:32:14] <+nharliecash> because it just made the numbers go higher
[2:32:15] <MyNameIsRasus> Fisticuffs didn't have dong dong tho
[2:32:17] <+pantherpiss2> FeelsGoodMan
[2:32:21] <KgKid51> Goku oscura Kreygasm
[2:32:23] <%Menitta> Super is a fun watch. It suffers the exact same issues as DBZ I feel
[2:32:24] <$konekoryugamine> NOTHING can repair DB after GT
[2:32:27] <$konekoryugamine> GT was THAT bad.
[2:32:28] <+GenesisKnight> @nharliecash it wasn't meant to fix GT it was meant to replace it
[2:32:28] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> He must be a Cell Saga elitist
[2:32:28] <exalt4747> Dong dong BELONGED on fisticuffs though
[2:32:30] <Sandro2584> The goku black arc is a fucking mess
[2:32:35] <%spicecrisis> Bio Broly DLC
[2:32:36] <SpookyBeef7> @nharliecash It fixed GT by making it irrelevant.
[2:32:36] <YeezusPieces1> Everything except OG DB is trash lets be honest
[2:32:37] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Gohan. The Biggest Disappointment.
[2:32:48] <$konekoryugamine> And anyone who likes GT, more power to you. Just recognize that EVERYONE in the fandom knows it's garbo.
[2:32:53] <Sphincter_Spelunker> But SSJ4.... FeelsBadMan
[2:33:00] <LucidInDarkness> Super mostly recreated old DBZ moments if you pay attention
[2:33:02] <drefizz> @YeezusPieces1 you only say that cause og Db had boobs
[2:33:08] <+GenesisKnight> SSJ4 doesn't excuse the rest of the shit
[2:33:10] <ZippyPsycho> Just noticed that the guy is playing team two dads
[2:33:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Didn't say it did
[2:33:26] <Twon_From_Wakanda> SSJ4 is better looking than Blue
[2:33:35] <$konekoryugamine> "You ever seen that show My Two Dads? Well, think of that, but only gay!"
[2:33:37] <%linkwolf4> I love the goku black arc only for the one line in it. YOU GUYS KNOW THE ONE woolieSMUG
[2:33:39] <drefizz> ssj4 is cooler in deisgn I will say that
[2:33:44] <+Irridium> I legit really like SSJ4 I want that to come back with the fur and everything
[2:33:44] <%Greatnumber> All of DB is varying degrees of sort of bad, to alright, to great. Nothing is overly offensive, but there are great moments that everyone remembers from each one.
[2:33:47] <%CEGold> I'd take Omega Shenron, Baby, and Super 17 over Black and Jiren any day cmonBruh
[2:33:50] <+damnitmcgarnicle> whoa
[2:33:51] <Sandro2584> Ill take ssj4 over pallette swaps any day lol
[2:33:52] <KeiPrime> massanananssnanpo
[2:33:55] <%NumberTooBig> 2 and a half Saiyens Kappa
[2:33:57] <sorrysues> i dont know, goku as ssb just doesnt fit right with me
[2:33:58] <Sk8t3> this is a real as hell line, i need to pee
[2:34:01] <Run44forrest> piccolo is so fun to play
[2:34:02] <buttchan> Let me see them loops
[2:34:07] <KeiPrime> piccolo is fuckin sick
[2:34:17] <Sphincter_Spelunker> The concept of overusing the Dragon Balls having a consequence was good in theory
[2:34:17] <%ventus_fury> Hm... has this been worth waiting an hour? o3o
[2:34:18] <ARBITERWARPIG> People who think GT is better than Super are insane
[2:34:29] <drefizz> Actually db heros' manga came up with a possible way for ssj4 to return in super if they did it, which is Ki energy tails
[2:34:33] <Twon_From_Wakanda> WHAT IF GokuBlack was actually Goten?! Yeah remember him NotLikeThis
[2:34:44] <+DestroyerPhoenix> ssj4 represents an evolution of the saiyan heritage and tapping into their primal power, it's way cooler than the god forms
[2:34:48] <Sandro2584> @cegold idk man at least jiren and black are fun to make fun of i got literally nothin on omega and super 17 and i watched gd twice
[2:34:52] <Brofarian> SSJ4 is cooler in both design AND lore than anything Super Saiyan God related. Whoever decided that the strongest form of a brutal warrior race came from everyone holding hands in friendship is an idiot.
[2:34:53] <fidorulz> man this soundtrack brings back memories
[2:34:59] <+Irridium> shouldn't goten and trunks should be like teenegers by now
[2:35:02] <%Greatnumber> SSJ4 is basically half canon due to the Broly movie.
[2:35:11] <+LastHazzerd> remember how in GT dying in Hell meant nothing, and in Z dying in hell meant erasure from existence
[2:35:12] <sorrysues> @Irridium theyre like 13/14 im pretty sure
[2:35:20] <+SvenHolgersson> RIP
[2:35:20] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> They are believe it or not @irridium
[2:35:21] <+DestroyerPhoenix> broly totally woulda gone ssj4 if he had his tail still 4Head
[2:35:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> God Saiyans only look the way they do cuz budget
[2:35:26] <Twon_From_Wakanda> @Brofarian Poooound
[2:35:28] <+VektorTroika> there's MOOOOOORE
[2:35:31] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 Omega is forever a favorite for when Goku was charging his Kamehameha and he said "Don't you know anything else?!"
[2:35:31] <gottigotbundles> GGS
[2:35:32] <+Irridium> then why do they look like they're 7-8
[2:35:33] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Player 1 Red. Player 2 Blue
[2:35:37] <ZombieShooz> someone should play as naruto, he's my favorite
[2:35:41] <+Irridium> why is anime like this
[2:35:42] <wolftundra> Finally
[2:35:42] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Laziness @irridium
[2:35:52] <Sandro2584> @cegold Ok Ok ill give you that one
[2:36:08] <sorrysues> i dont thinks its laziness its just they want a kid character in dragonball
[2:36:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> noo
[2:36:14] <ECRead> im red :)
[2:36:15] <King___Crimson> When is someone going to pick all might?
[2:36:20] <+VektorTroika> @ZombieShooz i like urameshi more, personally
[2:36:34] <%Greatnumber> @Irridium it's hard to make a difference between teens and kids when anime preportions oversize the head
[2:36:39] <%tomokocchi_> Kid Goku from DB is the only acceptable Goku I'd take as DLC at this point
[2:36:40] <KeiPrime> when ichigo
[2:36:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> welp i'm getting cut in front of in line so fuck it i guess
[2:36:48] <ZombieShooz> oh hell yes, @VektorTroika
[2:36:53] <DrkJP520> When we getting Kuririn Black?
[2:36:53] <exalt4747> I don't even want Kid Goku.
[2:37:02] <+nharliecash> when are they adding todd howard to this game
[2:37:02] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> No guest characters shotoEww
[2:37:02] <%Cavumentum> Kid Goku (DB) and then Kid Goku (GT)
[2:37:06] <Sandro2584> Whens goku jr tho
[2:37:07] <adjothetiger> @what's good woolz @WoolieVersus
[2:37:11] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 I'd admit that Super is waaay more hype than GT. I think they both are flawed but for different reasons. I can find enjoyment in both
[2:37:17] <DomunDomunDomun> When's Saitama?
[2:37:18] <MyNameIsRasus> DBZ is like KH in the sense that people say it's fucking dumb and the writing sucks and everyone's like: "Yeah, so?"
[2:37:19] <ARBITERWARPIG> WHEN'S HOKUTO X JOJO
[2:37:19] <+GunterDriger6> LUL LUL
[2:37:20] <KnivesEve> ichigo means katana
[2:37:20] <ZombieShooz> omfg I'd kill for krillin black
[2:37:20] <ManOfReason> whens eva unit 01
[2:37:23] <+nharliecash> da black krillin
[2:37:28] <Twon_From_Wakanda> @KeiPrime You mean getsuga tenshou?
[2:37:29] <%ventus_fury> I have to give up on this D:
[2:37:31] <+DrZhivago311> "Everyone is a pink square now adays" Me, a green square: "haha yeaaahahhhhhhh"
[2:37:34] <YeezusPieces1> Whens Meruem the superior Cell?
[2:37:48] <TheBrunoZone> I don't even care about Kid Goku. Too many Gokus got me pretty exhausted to even complain about it
[2:37:57] <exalt4747> Meruem is one of my favorite characters.
[2:37:58] <%CEGold> Where's Cell-X Kappa
[2:37:58] <+nharliecash> i tried playing this game online but the wait times were brutal for the west coast
[2:38:01] <Sandro2584> @cegold yea same i feel like if you combined the good bits of both shows youd leave with something thats better than the sum of their parts
[2:38:05] <TheBrunoZone> Got me that Goku fatigue
[2:38:09] <%Greatnumber> When's Gatzu?
[2:38:10] <theziggystar> This pink square is a bully! lol
[2:38:10] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @drzhivago311 Don't worry, there's plenty of trash pink squares
[2:38:13] <Run44forrest> dont talk to bardock players dont shake hands with bardock players
[2:38:13] <pirateofpie> @mynameisrasus KH is completely nonsensical though. DB is pretty simple to understand at least haha
[2:38:17] <%Cavumentum> Golden Raditz WHEN
[2:38:30] <Brofarian> I'm fine with Kid Goku because he's different design and power wise that it really wouldn't be that similar to adult Goku.
[2:38:30] <%tomokocchi_> Kid Goku could fight with his power pole which would be cool
[2:38:32] <MyNameIsRasus> @pirateofpie yeah I'll give you that
[2:38:33] <ARBITERWARPIG> KH is understandable y'all are just cowards.
[2:38:34] <+Irridium> when's taipon
[2:38:39] <KgKid51> Hitto Kreygasm
[2:38:40] <kakdela7> where's Goten Grande Padre forma verdadera
[2:38:46] <Sandro2584> You guys want real bullshit look at that KH lore recap TFS did
[2:38:46] <%ventus_fury> But to everyone in the chat, It was nice with what matches we got in if you played a VentusFury and @WoolieVersus Shame I can't get a round in tonight against you, but I hope eventually I can, at a later day! Have a good night with all these true scrublords woolieYE
[2:38:48] <%Greatnumber> Shaggy Verde tho
[2:38:50] <$konekoryugamine> Man all my favorite streams are on tonight!
[2:38:55] <$konekoryugamine> ALL OF THE WARRIORS ARE HERE TONIGHT
[2:38:59] <+VektorTroika> *Shaghan Verde
[2:39:06] <KeiPrime> Kh is understandable but you have to play everything, not just the numbers which confuses ppl
[2:39:06] <exalt4747> Ventus, did you play Pat the other day, btw?
[2:39:11] <$konekoryugamine> Ventus?
[2:39:14] <LucidInDarkness> KH isn't hard, ppl just like to hop on the wagon of "lol KH"
[2:39:14] <$konekoryugamine> Who's Ventus?
[2:39:17] <%ventus_fury> Yeah
[2:39:17] <%CEGold> The only KH I had a hard time understanding was DDD.
[2:39:19] <+DrZhivago311> I'm just here to lose to ya bois dawg started listening to the podcast and my friend said woolie streams fighting games sometimes when i heard he was doin fighterZ tonight i was so hyped
[2:39:19] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Bardock shotoEww
[2:39:19] <%ventus_fury> I Played him
[2:39:24] <%ventus_fury> I got my replays
[2:39:24] <brows_> Moustache Vegeta
[2:39:32] <%tomokocchi_> we riot if they add like Ultra Instinct Goku or SS God Goku
[2:39:42] <%Greatnumber> No, I want UI Goku to see how he plays.
[2:39:49] <$konekoryugamine> Can we all agree that MUSTACHE VEGETA is something that should NEVER have happened?
[2:39:52] <%CEGold> _/_/
[2:39:54] <ManOfReason> NO MORE GOKU
[2:39:55] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> He'll play like a Goku
[2:39:59] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Done
[2:40:00] <ARBITERWARPIG> MOOOSTAAACHE
[2:40:02] <exalt4747> I don't think Ultra Instinct would work well in this.
[2:40:03] <nobknee> Dragon Ball GT is the real deal.
[2:40:03] <KeiPrime> no, MORe goku
[2:40:04] <%linkwolf4> I really need to just bite the bullet and go into ranked at some point. just scared of getting bodied with nothing to learn
[2:40:05] <Brofarian> Don't hate on a man's facial grooming.
[2:40:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Kh is over convoluted, but the only thing that actually doesn't make sense is the time travel
[2:40:07] <Run44forrest> MUSTACHE VEGETA GOOD
[2:40:07] <%vjcruzer> no more Goku at all
[2:40:08] <KgKid51> More gokus :)
[2:40:09] <+damnitmcgarnicle> no more than 3 more Goku's
[2:40:13] <%Cavumentum> Mustache Vegeta looks like a GEEK
[2:40:13] <%Greatnumber> More gokus
[2:40:13] <Sandro2584> KH isnt hard to understand its just that the story is spread so thin with so many plotholes and retcons its almost not worth investing yourself in it
[2:40:14] <zaptar13> @greatnumber you simply couldn't hit him. it'd be bullshit.
[2:40:16] <+Comrade_Vladof> Oops, all Gokus
[2:40:21] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Yeah, more VEGETAS
[2:40:22] <+VektorTroika> oops all goku
[2:40:27] <NinjaGentleman> the only good goku is a dead goku
[2:40:31] <$konekoryugamine> I'm just saying! Some anime characters look good with a mustache, and Vegeta is NOT one of those characters!
[2:40:32] <%linkwolf4> did someone say GOKUS lytKILLGOKU
[2:40:35] <$konekoryugamine> He looked like a porn star
[2:40:36] <%Greatnumber> @zaptar13 that's why I want them to think of a way to make it work without making it obviously bullshit
[2:40:37] <+nharliecash> I CAME HERE TO LAUGH AT YOU!
[2:40:41] <$konekoryugamine> What else do you want me to say>
[2:40:41] <+SmilingBoi> Mustache Vegeta is extremely good
[2:40:42] <ARBITERWARPIG> Not the same Bardock tho
[2:40:42] <TheBrunoZone> @tomokocchi_ Well, you better start taking your pitchfork and torch, because you know it's gonna happen LUL
[2:40:45] <YeezusPieces1> Bardock is a scientist remember that?
[2:40:46] <Afrobrawler> Bardock doesn't care about being a low class
[2:40:49] <drefizz> KH isa series you need to play every game including the mobile to understand the story
[2:40:50] <%tomokocchi_> we also don't need Majin Vegeta or anything like that
[2:40:51] <nobknee> Vegeta can rock anything. Mustache and pink BAD DUDE shirt combo.
[2:40:53] <$konekoryugamine> Dude I will die on this hill.
[2:40:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Burdock has self esteem issues?
[2:40:58] <Brofarian> A BRILLIANT SCIENTIST
[2:40:58] <KgKid51> Vegeta is just born better than Bardock
[2:41:01] <ARBITERWARPIG> YOUR FATHER WAS AN AVERAGE WARRIOR
[2:41:05] <KeiPrime> barDORK
[2:41:09] <brows_> Prince of Slongs
[2:41:10] <%vjcruzer> is the line moving?
[2:41:12] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Bardock got what he deserved shotoWut
[2:41:13] <ThirdStrike_Alex> And much like all the other girls, Goku's mom is relegated to a broodmare
[2:41:22] <+xenonecromera> New Titanfall game confirmed. Likely not 3 though
[2:41:22] <Sandro2584> The entire timeline of kh makes no sense HOW OLD ARE AQUA TERRA AND VENTUS IF VENTUS WAS AROUND BEFORE THE KEYBLADE WAR BUT ALSO WAS STILL A CHILD WHEN SORA WAS BORN
[2:41:22] <$konekoryugamine> Goku HAD a mom?
[2:41:24] <ARBITERWARPIG> BUT HE WAS A BRILLIANT SCIENTIST
[2:41:24] <%CEGold> @konekoryugamine Then perish
[2:41:33] <%tomokocchi_> Mustache Vegeta was good only because we got a scene where he shaved it and acted like it was a big deal
[2:41:34] <Brofarian> How about instead of UI Goku, they add an install super to one of the gokus that just lets him go UI for a while Frieza style?
[2:41:39] <Run44forrest> gokus mom looks bad
[2:41:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Sandro2584 Time is convoluted
[2:41:44] <+greenfall> bardock was the legendary ssj, remember
[2:41:46] <+Emperor_Bad> farmer with shotgun or riot
[2:41:49] <drefizz> @Sandro2584 they explained why
[2:41:54] <Twon_From_Wakanda> @Sandro2584 shhhhhhhhhh
[2:41:56] <%Greatnumber> @Brofarian it's what I expected one of the Goku's to already be
[2:41:59] <$konekoryugamine> YO, Jiren always creeped me the FUCK out
[2:42:00] <MyNameIsRasus> gotta go chat, see ya guys Saturday! Today was fun as hell
[2:42:02] <$konekoryugamine> STILL DOES
[2:42:03] <nobknee> I'll take GT and mustache Vegeta over stupid blue god kid in Super any day.
[2:42:06] <$konekoryugamine> Like, stereotypical aliens
[2:42:09] <KeiPrime> whats the name of fuckin gohan's dumb jock classmate, put him in
[2:42:09] <%tomokocchi_> I would be down for Roshi to be DLC honestly
[2:42:10] <+nharliecash> you have to activate unfly mode first
[2:42:14] <+nharliecash> theny ou can fly unfly
[2:42:15] <+Stereotreme> Titanfall Immortal, coming to iOS and Android in Fall 2019
[2:42:17] <%Greatnumber> but alas that didn't happen
[2:42:17] <$konekoryugamine> I would actually place as Roshi
[2:42:25] <+slaterar> he thing i dont get about this game is that literally krillin and yamcha are competing agaist ssgs
[2:42:27] <ARBITERWARPIG> Where's the El Hermano mod
[2:42:28] <+slaterar> ssgsss
[2:42:31] <brows_> Erasa

[2:42:53] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> His 2H side switches shotoEww
[2:42:54] <%tomokocchi_> Erasa was the blonde girl

[2:42:56] <drefizz> I'll whisper it to you
[2:42:58] <buttchan> ayy I did it
[2:42:59] <%tomokocchi_> Sharpner was the dumb jock guy
[2:43:01] <buttchan> I won
[2:43:02] <$konekoryugamine> #NoMustache
[2:43:04] <+Kaito_Cam> @Sandro2584 Ventus was apart of a special group that were sent do the sleeping worlds before the keyblade war started which is why he didn't age, then he was put into castle oblivion when he was sleeping so still didn't age. Aqua was in the Realm of Darkness where time doesn't flow right so she didn't age
[2:43:06] <$konekoryugamine> I WILL DIE ON THIS HILL

[2:44:02] <ARBITERWARPIG> Y U M
[2:44:04] <KeiPrime> hell yeah @tomokocchi_
[2:44:21] <ECRead> vore
[2:44:22] <+GrayFox621> so is it just a free for all as to who gets to play woolie? I see a line but things are just a cluster f*** around him so I'm a bit confused
[2:44:23] <+nharliecash> @WoolieVersus what kind of tv you play fighting games on?
[2:44:26] <ARBITERWARPIG> god i wish that were me
[2:44:28] <Gutsandlove> doodLewd
[2:44:28] <KgKid51> Wait 21 is like 10 years old lol
[2:44:30] <King___Crimson> God I wish that was me
[2:44:30] <Checktrap> REGGIE
[2:44:35] <KeiPrime> the music sync on that tho
[2:44:36] <%Greatnumber> @Brofarian I feel while it would be more in line to the original series. It could create issues with balancing or just complexity. Because you would then at times have either multiple pure clones until they hit a bar threshold, or characters that would have 2-3 different move lists depending on the bars they got.
[2:44:37] <TigerClaws12> what a challenge wtf
[2:44:44] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> 21 is 16's mom
[2:44:45] <exalt4747> The person 21 was based on was like 40.
[2:44:51] <Gutsandlove> great super
[2:44:52] <+XenoSentience> ^
[2:44:57] <Sandro2584> Ok but how did Ventus get out of those dream worlds to take part in birth by sleeps story
[2:44:58] <NinjaGentleman> ^
[2:45:18] <Run44forrest> oof
[2:45:18] <drefizz> he was put in them AFTER
[2:45:20] <+XenoSentience> 21 AS AN ANDROID is 10. as a person she was a grown as woman and a mom
[2:45:21] <KgKid51> Praise me BlessRNG
[2:45:22] <Brofarian> @Greatnumber that's a risk I'm willing to take
[2:45:28] <KeiPrime> ventus was awake in birth by sleep you dope
[2:45:30] <ARBITERWARPIG> I wish the KH collections were on Xbox
[2:45:33] <Checktrap> Sup homies !
[2:45:37] <KeiPrime> he goes to sleep at the end

[2:46:33] <+Crankypancake> Time to watch my homie get nutted in live on stream
[2:46:34] <+Kaito_Cam> they tried cloning broly
[2:46:36] <Brofarian> It's kind of implied Xehanort knew how to retrieve Ventus since he researched all the Keyblade War stuff, allowing him to take him as an apprentice.
[2:46:37] <cool_culainn> Android 21 is in her 40s. She's just been an android for a few years

[2:47:37] <kakdela7> Pui Pui should be next dlc
[2:47:40] <$konekoryugamine> Someone as saintly as Hercule does NOT deserve to be called Satan
[2:47:40] <+kraftium> farmer with shotgun is the true hero of dragon ball z
[2:47:41] <%linkwolf4> His name is straight up Hercule Satan tho.
[2:47:42] <drefizz> Remember when Trunks flipped of Broly

[2:48:13] <+theAncopro> He will be the Solid Snake for DBFZ
[2:48:13] <Brofarian> If they weren't cowards they would make super buu and go full Smash Bros Kirby by giving him an absorption mechanic for every other character in the game.
[2:48:14] <RipSlamsteak> I want Mr Satan and I want his 5S to be a GUN
[2:48:17] <KeiPrime> or was that cui cui

[2:48:22] <$konekoryugamine> @Soul_Bruce_Lee I knew that, I was just being pedantic. LUL
[2:48:23] <ARBITERWARPIG> Have Launch in the game modeled after Elphelt
[2:48:23] <Sandro2584> @drefizz What im saying is in the mobile game which is canon it takes place before and during the keyblade war and that is when you find out ventus is in the game because you meet him in the dream worlds along with pink haired organization 13 guys so my question is how did he get out of that world for birth by sleep
[2:48:26] <YeezusPieces1> You're going to get UI Goku and you're going to like it
[2:48:30] <+Kaito_Cam> He level 3 better be the fucking present or I swear
[2:48:31] <DrkJP520> Mr Satan's VAs BOTH died thought :,(
[2:48:33] <+nharliecash> Mr satan is a godlike name if you prefer hercule you should be drug out into the street and run over with a capsule car
[2:48:35] <88koichi> nah give mr satan that present from budokai
[2:48:37] <lordreginald> "uuuuh here!" "say goodbye!"

[2:54:17] <+nharliecash> @gael_jebidibah kirllin left the monestary because the monks were evil and bullied him
[2:54:19] <cool_culainn> Worst dbz character is whatever videl you prefer
[2:54:22] <+XenoSentience> @gael_jebidibah he was raised by monks and left before he even met goku so he's not tied down with their rules
[2:54:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> The Stinky Guy from Dragon Ball
[2:54:25] <%CEGold> What's worst? A bad character or a boring one?
[2:54:26] <Brofarian> Garlic Jr. DLC when?
[2:54:28] <+nharliecash> @gael_jebidibah and he beat the shit out of them in the first tournament arch
[2:54:28] <%Cavumentum> BULLIES FROM DBE WHEN
[2:54:29] <%Paralurx> Bacterian DLC when?
[2:54:31] <%Greatnumber> @cool_culainn what if I like the Videl you like?
[2:54:35] <$konekoryugamine> The WORST character from Dragon Ball series
[2:54:39] <+Kaito_Cam> Yooo Arale for FighterZ
[2:54:42] <DrkJP520> Arale is basically Kirby of the Dragon Ball universe.
[2:54:43] <$konekoryugamine> And NO one can bring up anything from GT
[2:54:45] <tj_timbs> Hitler from Fusion Reborn
[2:54:47] <cool_culainn> @greatnumber THEN I HAVE THE SHIT TASTE
[2:54:49] <brows_> Lunch dlc
[2:54:50] <+XenoSentience> arale in dbfz would be Od
[2:54:51] <KeiPrime> Ranfan DLC with stripping level 3
[2:54:51] <Sandro2584> @cegold a boring one at least a bad character can make me feel something
[2:54:53] <pirateofpie> Arable would be a dope dlc character
[2:54:55] <+nharliecash> shes a main character
[2:54:58] <Fyrijou> Videl only in the game to include more female characters.
[2:55:01] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Isn't she an android
[2:55:04] <Brofarian> Vegeta knows he can't try to fight seriously against an 80's gag manga character
[2:55:05] <+gael_jebidibah> I see I know nothing about OG Dragonball
[2:55:09] <%CEGold> @Sandro2584 That's EXACTLY what I say
[2:55:10] <+Kaito_Cam> He literally says why am I fighting a Gag character
[2:55:11] <+GunterDriger6> got kicked from the lobby
[2:55:14] <+XenoSentience> OG anime only Maron for DBFZ Kappa
[2:55:15] <%tomokocchi_> Arale would be a cool character but probably broken as hell
[2:55:16] <extradopeness> English Dub Jase is worst DBZ character
[2:55:23] <%Greatnumber> He's space austrailian though
[2:55:27] <+Kaito_Cam> She literally punches the planet in half in SUper
[2:55:29] <$konekoryugamine> Recoome is kind og lame.
[2:55:34] <Brofarian> He's from space Brisben
[2:55:36] <+nharliecash> WHAT
[2:55:39] <+nharliecash> Recoome is gdlk
[2:55:40] <majindusto> MARK "HERCULE" SATAN for FIGHTERZ PLZ
[2:55:41] <exalt4747> The worst kind of character is one who is treated like a good guy but does awful shit.
[2:55:43] <KeiPrime> recoome gets cool when he gets his teeth kicked out
[2:55:44] <Sandro2584> Hes from the land of the space criminals tho
[2:55:49] <%CEGold> @konekoryugamine But his name rhymes with doom
[2:55:51] <+nharliecash> RECOOOME ERASERRR GUN
[2:55:54] <%Greatnumber> Recoome is a big guy so he immediately is cool
[2:55:54] <+Emperor_Bad> gotta add Suppaman
[2:55:57] <%vjcruzer> and got kicked

[3:07:12] <%Greatnumber> like I don't understand why they decided on a realistic style
[3:07:16] <jerrythegamebrio> Do you insist that I calm down?
[3:07:19] <%tomokocchi_> a problem with a lot of early dragon ball games was every character was samey
[3:07:23] <$konekoryugamine> @jerrythegamebrio Seriously though, if you hate the game that much, and think these guys are that bad in playing it, then why stick around here? Takahata is streaming some WWE if you wanna see the Trashman.
[3:07:25] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Don't pay the trolls any mind
[3:07:25] <TheBrunoZone> Did he even drink anything before the stream?

[3:14:31] <%Greatnumber> Akihiko just got a decent amount of buffs this recent patch
[3:14:31] <EnderGamma> Did you see the big Aki buffs? @woolieversus
[3:14:33] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Oh man, Jiren is so strong ResidentSleeper
[3:14:35] <DrkJP520> I'm pretty sure people are cutting in line, sneaking into the small cluster of people in the ring. i see 8 squares, then 7, then 8, etc
[3:14:39] <Triplicat> big fat akihiko buffs
[3:14:41] <+butch_deadlift> aki is so good now in bbtag

[3:15:22] <%NumberTooBig> i second UNIST
[3:15:29] <jsavarin> @WoolieVersus They recently buffed the hell out of akihiko in Cross Tag. His Neutral game is pretty beefy now
[3:15:29] <EnderGamma> Soon™
[3:15:33] <KeiPrime> art of fighting 3?
[3:15:34] <Triplicat> where
[3:15:36] <Triplicat> does redblade live
[3:15:39] <LucidInDarkness> Never forget, Jiren was not only an uninteresting character design, but also a massive dick when his "backstory" is revealed
[3:15:42] <@Menitta> Pokken
[3:15:48] <%linkwolf4> @WoolieVersus considering your love for boxer characters, what made you choose blanka over balrog?
[3:15:56] <TheBrunoZone> @Sphincter_Spelunker STRONGER TO EVEN STAND A CHANCE AGAINST GOHAN BLANCO? PogChamp
[3:15:58] <%PersonaTeddie112> @LucidInDarkness agreed!
[3:16:01] <$konekoryugamine> "Who's goin' chicken hunting? WE'RE GOING CHICKEN HUNTING!"
[3:16:04] <+Jordan_z123> @lucidindarkness man I forgot all about his backstory
[3:16:05] <Sandro2584> Whens one of those naruto 2.5d gamecube games
[3:16:08] <%NumberTooBig> @LucidInDarkness but now he has a bunch of Geese Howard stuff so its all good Kappa
[3:16:13] <%PersonaTeddie112> I hated his backstory so lame!
[3:16:13] <%aishman> Seriously Woolie, that video you guys did of UNIST convinced me to buy the game on Steam. How much fun you and Pat had with the game made me go "I need this"
[3:16:16] <+SlappyMeats> Jiren looks like an adorable pet baby in a body that doesn't belong
[3:16:20] <$konekoryugamine> When's Ori?
[3:16:22] <%Greatnumber> Jiren Sasuke
[3:16:25] <xiccy> Some Arcana Heart 3
[3:16:29] <%BarryGibbz> game Jiren is better than anime Jiren i think
[3:16:30] <LucidInDarkness> @NumberTooBig You're not wrong LUL
[3:16:34] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @TheBrunoZone We can only hope. But then who will fight EL PADRE GRANDE?
[3:16:37] <Sandro2584> Jiren looks like buff rufus from kim possible
[3:16:37] <+Kiyosuki> canon victory for 17 Kappa
[3:16:38] <$konekoryugamine> Jiren looks like an alien that roided up in a gym.
[3:16:46] <@Menitta> Who is the "boxer" styled character in Soul Caliber?
[3:16:49] <$konekoryugamine> NO idea
[3:16:51] <+Literally_bats> which siide?
[3:16:53] <Triplicat> one of the best NA UNIST players is from Canada but I don't remember which coast
[3:16:59] <%Greatnumber> Voldo Kappa
[3:17:02] <Sandro2584> @menitta Maxi?
[3:17:02] <KeiPrime> talim, i guess
[3:17:03] <+Stratiotai2> jiren is the worst boi
[3:17:03] <EnderGamma> you didn't choose blanka. blanka chose you
[3:17:04] <+nharliecash> @majindusto heihachi
[3:17:06] <%backfire_shot> Confirmed Woolie is blanka scum since 91
[3:17:06] <reiju_22> 2b
[3:17:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Maxi, kinda. Yeah
[3:17:11] <TheBrunoZone> @Sphincter_Spelunker Gohan Blanco Colombiano, obviously
[3:17:17] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> TALIM
[3:17:18] <$konekoryugamine> Jiren looks like an Area 51 reject that got crossed with Dwayne Johnson
[3:17:21] <LucidInDarkness> It's bad when I keep up with the dumbest plot stuff no one cares about
[3:17:23] <+Irridium> 2B is probably the closest
[3:17:31] <chambatron> Maxi
[3:17:40] <%Wool> Did y'all do anything for Lunar New Years today
[3:17:41] <EnderGamma> oh yeah 2B is a soul Cal character again
[3:17:45] <+VektorTroika> Maxi's more like Fei, being a Bruce Lee stand in
[3:17:47] <$konekoryugamine> Jiren is that one alien doll you popped the head off of and put it back on a GI Joe action figure for the luls.
[3:17:49] <jsavarin> the best "brawlers" In SC 6 at the moment are Maxi and Talim
[3:17:56] <Triplicat> I just noticed something actually
[3:18:05] <+SlappyMeats> Jiren looks like if you went into the Perfect Dark character creator and mixed Elvis and Mr. Blonde
[3:18:07] <%BarryGibbz> hello earthlings I come from planet Fitness - Jiren probably
[3:18:12] <%backfire_shot> Bald bois team!!!!
[3:18:13] <loveplusearth> I thought I was the only one to let personal attachment be a factor in picking a character
[3:18:16] <+Kiyosuki> lol all the jiren hate
[3:18:18] <raveous> can Yoshi put his sword away? If so than he can be considered a brawler as well
[3:18:18] <Triplicat> for all the dumb BULLSHIT you have to go through for playing at locals/tourneys on PS4
[3:18:18] <+Jordan_z123> Has Woolie talked about the mk11 stream from today ?
[3:18:20] <Sandro2584> Jiren looks like a dirty buff snowman
[3:18:23] <%Greatnumber> Those gains are all natty
[3:18:25] <$konekoryugamine> Jiren looks like the models from Marvel Ultimate got crossed with Destroy All Aliens
[3:18:28] <%Cavumentum> ALL VEGETA OR COWARD
[3:18:28] <KeiPrime> frieza
[3:18:30] <+DrunkenDice> we getting some Nappa gameplay psykenCry

[3:18:34] <$konekoryugamine> I can keep this going LUL
[3:18:35] <Triplicat> it sure is easy to hot swap controllers being used on PS4
[3:18:38] <%backfire_shot> Bald Bois!!!!
[3:18:40] <GreatGeargiaGatewayYGO> Is it a Tonfa that Zwei wields? Thought it was a Sword he just wielded differently?
[3:18:43] <TheBrunoZone> But seriously though, I'm glad that Jiren, as bland as he is, it's a lot of fun in Fighterz. It says a lot about how ArcSys handles the roster
[3:18:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> He has gauge earrings and serves a mean Black coffee
[3:19:00] <Triplicat> coming from someone who's played in groups of friends that use both stick and pad
[3:19:02] <+DrunkenDice> Nappa time! PogChamp
[3:19:03] <+SlappyMeats> Jiren looks like baby Big Show

[3:19:18] <+DrunkenDice> lytFILTH
[3:19:21] <$konekoryugamine> GOD DAMN IT NAPPA
[3:19:21] <LucidInDarkness> @TheBrunoZone Now we need a take on Yojirobi and Pilaf
[3:19:25] <KeiPrime> kid buu fat buu 21
[3:19:27] <$konekoryugamine> Had to do it LUL
[3:19:28] <+nharliecash> didnt tiens double super get nerfed
[3:19:30] <+Irridium> Freiza's bald
[3:19:30] <+Kiyosuki> Jiren's a terrible character (imo) but he also made a pretty ok villain just cause at least I wanted his swarmy ass to get beat so bad lol
[3:19:31] <@Menitta> Frieza is bald
[3:19:34] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Buu is bald
[3:19:36] <Run44forrest> try my team: frieza piccolo goku black
[3:19:37] <%BarryGibbz> buu is bald
[3:19:38] <EnderGamma> is bald defined as lack of hair or absence of hair?
[3:19:46] <%Greatnumber> absence
[3:19:47] <$konekoryugamine> Lack of hair
[3:19:53] <$konekoryugamine> No, wait, yeah, absence
[3:19:55] <%backfire_shot> Both
[3:19:56] <zackmuffin> This is your Dailey reminder that hit is over 1000 years old
[3:19:57] <+GreatBrightBlack> HEAD CHALA
[3:19:59] <$konekoryugamine> LACK of hair implies shaves
[3:19:59] <%Greatnumber> lack of hair implies that there still is some
[3:20:00] <+DrunkenDice> rip the Nappa dream mewnSad
[3:20:01] <KeiPrime> romatiku ageruyo
[3:20:15] <IOptimusGrimes> is my chair bald because of the absence of hair?
[3:20:17] <+VektorTroika> ROMANTIC LOVE
[3:20:22] <%Greatnumber> yes
[3:20:25] <Sandro2584> Oooo i havent seen a gotenks in a while
[3:20:25] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Gotenks and Gohan. ready your butthole
[3:20:26] <BwdYeti> wow this team
[3:20:26] <%Greatnumber> you have a bald chair
[3:20:32] <$konekoryugamine> Dude I have seen some of the weirdest fucking yaois about Vegeta and Goku on DA
[3:20:35] <KeiPrime> super colossal donut
[3:20:35] <$konekoryugamine> Like one was
[3:20:38] <+Kiyosuki> complete absense of hair could just mean your hair is so beautiful a human mind cant register it. Kappa
[3:20:40] <+SlappyMeats> is a bald guy a sandwich?
[3:20:40] <$konekoryugamine> AND VEGETA WAS THE DONUT
[3:20:41] <LucidInDarkness> Okay stop
[3:20:44] <madogod> time for some Excellent Adventures
[3:20:46] <raveous> I feel like there is a difference between creature's that are bald and creatures that don't grow hair, cuz you wouldn't call a snake "bald". With that same mentality, I think characters like piccolo and frieza would also not be considered bald
[3:20:51] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Everyone that stream snipes Max doodStare
[3:20:58] <LucidInDarkness> @konekoryugamine No, bad. Keep the yaoi in your mind
[3:20:59] <%linkwolf4> team father and sons
[3:21:00] <drefizz> It doesnt matter if you love me or capital M E
[3:21:07] <$konekoryugamine> @LucidInDarkness BUT IT'S GOOD.
[3:21:09] <Run44forrest> is this the DB ending PogCHamp
[3:21:10] <+VektorTroika> y a ' l l

[3:21:14] <%backfire_shot> A father, his two sons and half of another kid
[3:21:20] <+badmr7> Is this the DB ending?
[3:21:23] <Sandro2584> I love gotenks so much but i hate goten and trunks
[3:21:26] <%tomokocchi_> OH, something good did come from GT. The opening song "Dan Dan".
[3:21:26] <LucidInDarkness> @konekoryugamine I have no problem with yaoi, but chat may not agree LUL
[3:21:26] <$konekoryugamine> Wait, what;s the other half kid
[3:21:38] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @adjothetiger Dood! I'm well, how about you?
[3:21:38] <%Greatnumber> I disagree with the talk of yaoi
[3:21:45] <%backfire_shot> Trunks

[3:21:48] <LucidInDarkness> See
[3:21:54] <+VektorTroika> gohan duh
[3:21:56] <$konekoryugamine> Eh, it's not for everyone.

[3:22:03] <BwdYeti> welcome to the mix
[3:22:04] <+nharliecash> this is a yuri chat, we dont take kindly to yaoi round here
[3:22:05] <KeiPrime> fuckin piccolo
[3:22:06] <extradopeness> GoTEN
[3:22:08] <%psycosis> F
[3:22:10] <adjothetiger> @Soul_Bruce_Lee not to bad been streaming RE2 a few times getting close to the end of leon's run
[3:22:14] <%Greatnumber> this is a christian stream with pastor woolie giving us the word of combos from up high
[3:22:16] <$konekoryugamine> But MAN is it weird that it exists! Who knew people shipped Krillin and Goku?!
[3:22:17] <Sandro2584> High level piccolo is so gross
[3:22:18] <Mattmandx1> Piccolo still strong even with the snap back nerf
[3:22:21] <LucidInDarkness> Never forget the HS days of girls trying to give you their yaoi collections LUL
[3:22:24] <KeiPrime> i love it, green man
[3:22:27] <$konekoryugamine> I DID THAT! XD
[3:22:28] <%Cavumentum> Thought it was the church of Skindentation
[3:22:31] <chambatron> It's Daigo all over again #choke
[3:22:32] <chambatron> jk
[3:22:34] <+Megameeeee> is he playing on PS4?
[3:22:34] <TheBrunoZone> @tomokocchi_ Also, it's the only show that respects the aging of characters, so chars like Goten and Trunks look like actual teenagers, something that Super didn't bother to risk with
[3:22:35] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @adjothetiger Such a good game, hope you're enjoying it.
[3:22:35] <$FuqBoiSlim> where are the hellzone grenade loops
[3:22:43] <+GreatBrightBlack> build a cabin there and watch titanfall die
[3:22:46] <%Greatnumber> I mean it's not hard, everyone ships everyone if they spend more than 5 seconds on screen with them.
[3:22:47] <+DrunkenDice> oh piccolo psykenZZZ
[3:22:58] <$konekoryugamine> @Greatnumber It's true
[3:22:59] <Prism_Wing> Did one of the characters just go "sheeeiiit"?
[3:23:02] <adjothetiger> @Soul_Bruce_Lee you know i am you should stop by sometime and talk some BS while i play
[3:23:05] <$konekoryugamine> Sadly
[3:23:07] <+SlappyMeats> honestly, it's embarassing for a character to not get shipped
[3:23:15] <Run44forrest> whoa that side switcch
[3:23:17] <+Emperor_Bad> man i love piccolo
[3:23:20] <Personified134> he's TRYING to say "I see you" but he's really saying "sheeeiit"
[3:23:20] <+Kiyosuki> no one ships Jiren
[3:23:21] <LucidInDarkness> Shipping becomes a problem when it's done with real people
[3:23:22] <$konekoryugamine> And when you're in the Homestuck fandom, you can HATE shit them. :3
[3:23:23] <KeiPrime> the homing ball
[3:23:25] <KeiPrime> SO GOOD
[3:23:26] <%backfire_shot> For fathers day does piccolo get a worlds best dad mug and goku get a worlds best fighter mug?
[3:23:27] <%CEGold> Piccolo vs Hit Kreygasm the one fight I wanted more than anything

[3:23:53] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @adjothetiger I only do that when Steve is being trash LUL
[3:23:55] <$konekoryugamine> Progress!
[3:23:59] <LucidInDarkness> So...do we have a confirmed age for Goku? SInce he keeps dying and all?
[3:24:00] <$konekoryugamine> XD

[3:24:41] <KingKodiakVA> 40
[3:24:43] <raveous> all your nicknames are terrible, best name is Brohan
[3:24:44] <TheBrunoZone> Chi Chi's about the same age as Goku's
[3:24:45] <%Greatnumber> you have to remember that goku spend like multiple days in the hyperbolic time chamber
[3:24:47] <LucidInDarkness> Cuz...there is a big gap there due to Goku's deaths LUL
[3:24:47] <Mattmandx1> Videl can sparking cancel after her lvl 1
[3:24:56] <%BarryGibbz> lol the stickers
[3:24:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Broly movie said he left planet Vegeta 41 years ago
[3:25:02] <+Kiyosuki> do saiyans even age the same as humans?
[3:25:06] <%Greatnumber> No
[3:25:07] <Sandro2584> Chichi is like late 40s since goku is in his early 50s
[3:25:08] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Yeah, until they add assist options
[3:25:08] <+Kiyosuki> like when they become adults
[3:25:12] <EnderGamma> rbeeFAT rbeeFAT rbeeFAT rbeeFAT
[3:25:16] <drefizz> YES

[3:25:39] <%backfire_shot> saiyans live way longer than humans
[3:25:41] <%Greatnumber> The main thing in the Broly movie is Bulma being mad that she doesn't age as slow as Vegeta. @Kiyosuki

[3:27:33] <King___Crimson> shirts are cringe but this song is a fuckin banger
[3:27:43] <+SlappyMeats> I don't think my power level is high enough to pull off irony that juicy
[3:27:43] <%psycosis> Sad thing is people actually wear shirts like this and love it
[3:27:48] <+GreatBrightBlack> fuck that I'm not going to the mall
[3:27:49] <extradopeness> Lil V do it
[3:27:52] <+FrostedZaibatsu> i bought TIanfall 2 for woolie. what do now?
[3:27:52] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Soul_Bruce_Lee You a chola in middle school?
[3:28:09] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Jebaited
[3:28:13] <%Greatnumber> Mail him the copy at the PO box that doesn't exist anymore
[3:28:15] <%CEGold> Don't try to figure me out. I'm a special kind of twisted (Yes I'm from Idaho)
[3:28:18] <Run44forrest> wait woolie is selling these shirts>
[3:28:23] <thesw1tch> smoke legal woolz
[3:28:29] <Sandro2584> Im gonna get one of these shirt designs tattooed across my eyelids
[3:28:31] <+burgersama_dlx> @Run44forrest he made 'em
[3:28:33] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN
[3:28:38] <+Louie_Salmon> I just fucking noticed that it says "recardless"
[3:28:41] <%CEGold> @Run44forrest No one truly knows Woolie's connection to these shirts
[3:28:47] <+Kaito_Cam> Low key freaking out over my background check for Microsoft. It was finished yersday but I haven't heard anything.
[3:28:47] <+Irridium> @FrostedZaibatsu Beat story then stare at multiplayer wishing for what once was
[3:28:52] <%Greatnumber> They simply find him
[3:28:55] <LucidInDarkness> I can't even deal with these shirts. I would rather replay KH1 on proud mode than wear one of these
[3:28:55] <+SlappyMeats> @CEGold there should definitely be a Cringe Shirt Generator
[3:28:57] <%psycosis> Woolie doesn't sell these shirts,those shitty promoted sites you see on Facebook do
[3:29:09] <Run44forrest> cool wheres the link
[3:29:12] <extradopeness> Yo im installing Titanfall 2 on PS4 though fuck Origin
[3:29:12] <%Greatnumber> @SlappyMeats surprised one doesn't exist
[3:29:30] <thepardack> If you had to get one of these shirt's designs tattooed on your chest which one would it be?
[3:29:31] <%Greatnumber> Speaking of titanfall did anyone actually play Apex at all?
[3:29:31] <%CEGold> @Kaito_Cam Take a breath. Stressing yourself won't help you. You got this! Good luck, my guy!
[3:29:37] <Sandro2584> I love that is specifically idaho
[3:29:38] <Run44forrest> I might live in IDAHO\
[3:29:42] <LucidInDarkness> So, has Apex Legends even drawn anyone's attention yet?
[3:29:46] <Run44forrest> i need that shirt
[3:29:54] <+Irridium> @Greatnumber I did. It's... okay.
[3:29:58] <+Kaito_Cam> @CEGold I emailed the recruiter but haven't heard out which is why i'm kinda freaking
[3:30:07] <%CEGold> @SlappyMeats No PC in the world could create such tasteful cringe as these shirts.
[3:30:08] <extradopeness> I see clips of it on IG
[3:30:16] <thesw1tch> dude, so my buddies and I were talking about songs and eventually started looking at rolling stones top 500 songs. no man who sold the world, but 50 cents in da club is on it
[3:30:16] <Sandro2584> @lucidindarkness in the same way two parents arguing in front of their kids does
[3:30:18] <%Greatnumber> Did you play Blops4's because to me it feels almost identical in movement
[3:30:21] <%CEGold> @Kaito_Cam Have you tried calling in to see what the hold up is?
[3:30:26] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Apex Legends, isn't that the Fortnite Sequel doodGlare1
[3:30:28] <%Greatnumber> which fucking sucks because like
[3:30:36] <+StromkoPenguin> Apex Legends is pointless, it's Titanfall with none of the features that differentiate that IP.
[3:30:41] <%Greatnumber> Man If it just played like titanfall that shit would be awesome
[3:30:49] <extradopeness> rolling stone is a rag
[3:30:54] <+Kaito_Cam> @CEGold I'm not sure if I should call he called me but I don't know if its a personal number or anything.
[3:30:58] <LucidInDarkness> I compare all the BR's as ice cream. PUBG/H1Z1 was straight up vanilla
[3:31:01] <Crows_feet> why does the shirt say recardless
[3:31:02] <+Irridium> @Greatnumber nah I dropped off cod years ago. And yeah if it played like Titanfall that'd be nice. But sadly it doesn't. All you get is a slide that's not as good
[3:31:12] <LucidInDarkness> Fortnite was a free ice cream cone with sprinkles
[3:31:15] <%linkwolf4> apex is alright, I just wish I could play solo and not in a random squad.
[3:31:27] <%CEGold> @Kaito_Cam I would give it another day and if you haven't heard anything by then, I would call.
[3:31:28] <LucidInDarkness> Blackout is a Banana spkit sundae
[3:31:54] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @thesw1tch Might be original songs? I doubt it'd widely known that Man Who Sold the World was before Bowie
[3:31:56] <LucidInDarkness> Apex looks like chocolate so far, since unlike the others, your character themselves matters
[3:31:57] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> I think he started 2 months ago, "RECARDLESS" wassup @mistspade
[3:32:05] <zackmuffin> @lucidindarkness now I want ice cream
[3:32:11] <+StromkoPenguin> I think PUBG and H1Z1 were like vanilla with rocks and twigs throne in. Fortnite just needed to be less crap to take the throne.
[3:32:23] <Sandro2584> And pubg isnt even ice cream its just spoiled cheese curds
[3:32:34] <LucidInDarkness> @zackmuffin LUL I dunno why, it just makes more sense as ice cream to me. Also, go get ice cream'
[3:32:38] <extradopeness> Yeah this ice cream as an analog
[3:32:38] <%Greatnumber> @Irridium you also get that grappling hook if you are that robot character, I almost exclusively played him because at times when you launched it felt like TF
[3:33:06] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> What's something redeeming about Apex Legends, off the top of your head, chat
[3:33:14] <+Irridium> @Greatnumber yeah that's true
[3:33:20] <%Greatnumber> It plays better than PUBG
[3:33:24] <reiju_22> its not fortnite
[3:33:25] <%CEGold> @Soul_Bruce_Lee The name reminds me of Brutal Legend
[3:33:31] <LucidInDarkness> @StromkoPenguin Fortnite just needed to not cost and have some bullshit sprinkles on top to take the throne
[3:33:33] <Sandro2584> its not radical heights
[3:33:37] <extradopeness> Its free!
[3:33:38] <+SvenHolgersson> Where;s the "Of course there's a spot in Hell It's called a throne" shirt
[3:33:41] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Okay, these answers are PRETTY strong
[3:33:48] <ArtooKilledYou> Has woolie been talking about apex? Just came into the stream
[3:33:58] <LucidInDarkness> @Soul_Bruce_Lee Character choice that actually matter I guess
[3:33:59] <+SvenHolgersson> THERE IT IS
[3:34:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I didn't listen to the podcast. So I don't know anything Apex Legends. That counts as a positive, yeah?
[3:34:13] <@Menitta> This is getting out of hand
[3:34:15] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> That's a good one @lucidindarkness
[3:34:17] <randomness_yo> Apex Legend is the Titan Killer
[3:34:19] <+Irridium> that one ninja chick looks very similar to speed of sound sonic from One Punch Man that makes me chuckle
[3:34:19] <@Menitta> now there are two of them
[3:34:29] <%Greatnumber> Honestly though there are neat little things in it. There are banners all around the island that show the top killers. @Soul_Bruce_Lee
[3:34:31] <lennyrager> Sup dom
[3:34:50] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @greatnumber That's pretty neat
[3:34:50] <extradopeness> Two Jerries?
[3:34:52] <LucidInDarkness> I dunno, I don't outright hate Fortnite, just the dumb bullshit that came from it. So I'll be happy to try out Apex and see if it's more my thing
[3:34:56] <lennyrager> Its Psydaku
[3:35:01] <+VidulaSaix> Recardless 4Head
[3:35:11] <+SlappyMeats> that Naruto one has the added bonus of being violently bad graphic design
[3:35:23] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @sphincter_spelunker It depends if you're into BR games I suppose
[3:35:33] <LucidInDarkness> If i actually had ps plus still and a few bucks, I'd buy and try Titanfall 2 instead tho LUL
[3:35:44] <extradopeness> Oh two throne shirts
[3:35:45] <randomness_yo> why play any of those when you could just play Black Out?
[3:35:45] <zackmuffin> @slappymeats which one
[3:36:03] <+VidulaSaix> What is this fucking Idaho shirt. That's so specific LUL
[3:36:04] <+SlappyMeats> the Pain one that is too long and shitty for me to read in one go
[3:36:10] <%Greatnumber> @Soul_Bruce_Lee There is also a floating platform which I can only describe as. Floating School from PUBG. Everyone drops to it, it has good weapons and it's a small as shit area that everyone dies at at the start.
[3:36:13] <+Lompie> I kind of want to wear the Idaho shirt. I’ve never been to Idaho but it’s calling to me
[3:36:13] <Sandro2584> @randomness_yo because vanill shooters arent some peoples cup of tea
[3:36:27] <randomness_yo> Anf Fortnite is?
[3:36:32] <randomness_yo> and*
[3:36:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> children aren't people
[3:36:51] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @greatnumber BIG RISK, EVEN BIGGER REWARD?
[3:36:54] <extradopeness> Recardless
[3:37:03] <Sandro2584> A vanilla shooter with a building mechanic that sets it apart from other battle royales
[3:37:03] <AbsentReality> Fortnite AND black out are ass
[3:37:05] <LucidInDarkness> @randomness_yo I mean, hop in and go gameplay + accessibility makes up for a lot I think
[3:37:21] <%Greatnumber> @Soul_Bruce_Lee sort of, it also lands you at the middle of the first circle so if you survive on it you get an easy ride to a good position
[3:37:23] <Run44forrest> its only $20 PogChamp
[3:37:28] <randomness_yo> well yes
[3:37:32] <Run44forrest> https://teenavi.com/ product/yes-im-super-saiyan-planet-vegeta-might-live-idaho/
[3:37:44] <extradopeness> THATS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FAIRY TAIL
[3:37:46] <+Irridium> what a steal @Run44forrest
[3:37:51] <Sandro2584> You are a god among men
[3:38:02] <%Greatnumber> Like Apex has interesting concepts, I just feel the base gameplay doesn't differentiate itself enough to make it memorable.
[3:38:14] <LucidInDarkness> So long as they actually do something with the crowd they oull in, they'll do fine
[3:38:16] <randomness_yo> Either way, I have to agree with Woolie after listening to the podcast. Titanfall 3 deserved the spot light
[3:38:24] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Okay, when you have BR game that does some drastically different then it's definitely not a throw away title off the bat
[3:38:34] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> something*
[3:38:35] <Sandro2584> @greatnumber to be fair how many of these types of games are actually gonna be remembered
[3:38:35] <%topendbuzz> woolieGASM woolieGASM
[3:38:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Who remembers Remember Me?
[3:38:51] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't
[3:38:52] <%Greatnumber> @Sandro2584 this is the Cod/Moba gold rush all over so 5 tops.
[3:38:54] <LucidInDarkness> @randomness_yo As Someone who never played either Titanfall, but knows how hype it was, you and Woolie alike are not wrong
[3:38:55] <+Irridium> yeah if it had Titanfall's pilot movement and a map built to support it it could have been really neat. And could help take the sting of Titanfall 3's death away.
[3:39:13] <ArtooKilledYou> What I think they shoulda done is make TF3 and make the apex mode f2p similar to fortnite’s business model
[3:39:25] <%Greatnumber> Well like what if, they made TF3 and put the BR mode as a multiplayer game mode like Blops4?
[3:39:28] <Sandro2584> @greatnumber i dont even think itll be that many lol
[3:39:44] <@Menitta> So just to confirm, people from Idaho are in fact Saiyans?
[3:39:47] <~WoolieVersus> technical difficulties
[3:39:49] <LucidInDarkness> Also remember, BR very much piggybacks off of the same hyoe feelings of old school deathmatch modes in other shooters
[3:39:52] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Titan Fall 3 isn't necessarily dead, perhaps they're saving it for next gen
[3:39:54] <@Menitta> o no
[3:39:59] <hntronium> Woolie vs Tech
[3:40:00] <zackmuffin> @irridium hey titanfall 3 isn’t technically dead until res pawn closes
[3:40:03] <extradopeness> Dude i just looked up the Pain shirt there are so many variations
[3:40:03] <hntronium> C U R S E D
[3:40:07] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Alright, Woolie. Take your time.
[3:40:09] <ArtooKilledYou> Iron out those difficulties
[3:40:12] <Sir_Kino> vinejoelTech
[3:40:13] <zackmuffin> @irridium so like in a month
[3:40:17] <randomness_yo> @Greatnumber That would have been fine because we still get TF3
[3:40:31] <+Crankypancake> Woolie read your donations before you skedaddle <3
[3:40:33] <extradopeness> The DS3 one especially hit close to home
[3:40:40] <+Irridium> @zackmuffin sbfpDattebayo
[3:40:46] <Sandro2584> Man the number 3 is just a curse in the gaming industry
[3:40:49] <%Greatnumber> @Sandro2584 I'm expecting this to last out at least as long as the Moba craze so we are going to get at least another 2 years of large publishers and small devs trying to make a name for themselves with these things
[3:41:12] <%Greatnumber> And if this E3 is anything to go off of we have at least 7 to look forward to in the next 5 months
[3:41:13] <Sandro2584> @greatnumber Fair point
[3:41:17] <LucidInDarkness> @Sandro2584 DMC3
[3:41:20] <Run44forrest> what happened with titan fall 3? im not caught up on the podcast
[3:41:23] <%Greatnumber> well last E3
[3:41:28] <LucidInDarkness> Halo 3
[3:41:39] <ArtooKilledYou> @run44forrest Ain’t in production because Apex
[3:41:41] <%Greatnumber> @Run44forrest Not currently in developement, and Apex is presumably the reason why
[3:41:46] <LucidInDarkness> uh
[3:41:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I just realized the Sasuke design is on the back of the t-shirt. I was wondering why is was so high up
[3:41:50] <LucidInDarkness> I ran outta 3's
[3:41:51] <randomness_yo> @Run44forrest It got killed off for Apex Legends
[3:41:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> it was*

[3:50:05] <Tomiko0> Blade Runner 3 looking sick
[3:50:25] <TheValiantBob> they need to add some kind of filter effect to the bots, hearing normal human voices out of these badass designs feels weird
[3:50:28] <%Greatnumber> I imagine there is definitely plethora of indie FGs that are complicated as hell.
[3:50:28] <%CEGold> @Intolerable What? You never heard of Super Saiyan Robo? Kappa
