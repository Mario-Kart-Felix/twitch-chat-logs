[0:04:03] <%Lion_kun> Done already!!?!
[0:04:09] <leith_aziz> Luckily, I played Rev 2, so I was already prepared for Strive
[0:04:18] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:04:27] <leith_aziz> But I gotta ask, was theere something that took place between Rev 2 and Strive?
[0:04:33] <@Menitta> This video will be all about the history of May's Dolphin
[0:04:33] <leith_aziz> *there
[0:04:56] <MKII> a list of all of it's war crimes
[0:05:06] <Equirah> @leith_aziz nope, strive story mode even mentions it's a 3 week time skip
[0:05:10] <@Solidus_113> nothing has topped the hype of Justice's reveal yet
[0:05:12] <%saladin1911> @menitta We can finally learn which circle of hell it came from LUL
[0:05:13] <%dreadedcthulhu> Pog
[0:05:13] <Prevot> I mean....
[0:05:13] <leith_aziz> Hey, music is music
[0:05:14] <Zomner> PogChamp
[0:05:23] <aoimaiden> pt 2 of gg lore always makes me cry when ky accepts dizzy and sky should be high kicks in ;-;
[0:05:27] <wolfen091> totsugeki
[0:05:27] <Shad0wTag> I love your work on GG lore, thanks to you I 100% was able to commit getting to Strive
[0:05:35] <Prevot> you better be syncing the action to the music
[0:05:50] <leith_aziz> Though for real, I may not have enjoyed the story if it wasnt for your videos, so thanks
[0:06:00] <leith_aziz> A lot of people recommend you videos
[0:06:07] <leith_aziz> *recommend your
[0:06:33] <Applecannon63> Kreygasm
[0:06:34] <linSP> woolie the director
[0:06:52] <leith_aziz> What a ride
[0:06:57] <Shad0wTag> Honestly after your videos and my own digging, GG lore really isn't that complex like some folks make out to be
[0:07:18] <leith_aziz> It beats the 4 hour alternative video
[0:07:49] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag I think it doesn't help that its made by the same company that did Blazublue
[0:08:01] <+LionheartedRebel> A lot of it is just that the lore is scattered among different mediums (i.e audio dramas, novels, manga) up until recently, so it's nice to have everything in one place.
[0:08:14] <turboyabo> probably could have split the videos into parts
[0:08:34] <leith_aziz> Dizzy is Ky's motivation, but usually doesnt get much to do

[0:08:54] <leith_aziz> Apparently in an article, it was mentioned that Venom wont come back
[0:09:01] <leith_aziz> @Ether101_Prime Yes. Never playable
[0:09:12] <@Solidus_113> Venom retired to be a baker with Robo Ky
[0:09:31] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 I have a feeling that they did that to retire him from the games
[0:10:00] <@Menitta> aw man
[0:10:03] <leith_aziz> Without spoiling, DONT do I-No's arcade route in Strive
[0:10:09] <leith_aziz> Ity spoils stuff from the story
[0:10:26] <Shad0wTag> The glossary in Strive is fantastic Woolz
[0:10:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:10:39] <Shad0wTag> You'll love it
[0:10:48] <%Juriasu> [Womanhood]
[0:11:04] <leith_aziz> Also, if you have questions about Faust in Strive, nothing is answered. Maybe for the DLC
[0:11:48] <Shad0wTag> They put a lot of effort into making every crazy term make sense
[0:11:58] <Equirah> what questions do you have regarding faust? his motives are apparent
[0:11:59] <leith_aziz> There is that kinda video funnily enough
[0:12:06] <aoimaiden> you've done a kickass job on the lore series, i think the scene had enjoyed it a lot
[0:12:29] <leith_aziz> @Equirah I mean STRIVE Faust, but I wont spoil much. The Glossary hints at something but I cant confirm 100% what happenbed
[0:12:36] <aoimaiden> especially considering a lot of serious players don't know so much about the story
[0:12:40] <@Solidus_113> The Complete Timeline
[0:12:58] <leith_aziz> Your series has helped a lot of people get into GG lore, especially Strive newcomers
[0:13:05] <MothPills> I did that lol
[0:13:06] <leith_aziz> It's recommended everywhere
[0:13:17] <@Menitta> I did that but I never touched the story or arcade mode yet
[0:13:21] <DaKnightWarrior> Thanks for all your hard work.
[0:13:34] <brunoberserk> thw important part is : KILL WIFE
[0:13:36] <@Solidus_113> If you didn't see Raven's Arcade intro in Rev 2 you have no idea who happy chaos is
[0:13:37] <leith_aziz> If you play Rev 2, ALWAYS play Episodes first
[0:13:38] <%Juriasu> talk about hockey reggie
[0:13:43] <@Menitta> think about wife
[0:13:46] <leith_aziz> Otherwise, it makes you confused
[0:13:49] <Equirah> @brunoberserk fucking really?
[0:13:58] <%jinking79> kill wife
[0:14:04] <brunoberserk> REGRET
[0:14:04] <leith_aziz> Save Wife
[0:14:07] <@Solidus_113> think about wife

[0:14:49] <Shad0wTag> The glossary and in game timeline in Strive Woolz, don't worry! Its super helpful and covers up to Rev 2!

[0:24:45] <Johannen> Reggie is as always correct
[0:24:57] <+Ether101_Prime> Go to the Dark Realm and fail.
[0:25:00] <rios> @prevot, its pooki's Love Hotel: Geisha edition
[0:25:02] <Applecannon63> You left off to where you're going to tem-ni gru?
[0:25:12] <ScreamLord> Dark Realm is good for Soul Farming
[0:25:46] <+Ether101_Prime> Dark Realm also leads to unlocks.
[0:25:48] <Johannen> My bodyy saidd nooooo....
[0:25:53] <Johannen> But my Miiiind
[0:26:05] <HollowMan190> you should listen to your body
[0:26:27] <taquito_blade> issen is a bitch for timing
[0:27:20] <ScreamLord> I used to be able to do chain-Issen pretty reliably in Onimusha 3 and how I can't do them at all
[0:27:34] <+Ether101_Prime> ...
[0:27:39] <taquito_blade> lol
[0:27:54] <taquito_blade> oh i love thid now
[0:27:57] <+SubtleFraudulence> There's a certain item you need to use to get through that. An Arrow
[0:28:04] <ink_dino> you can check "files" on the menu to read the note again, if you need a reminder
[0:28:12] <taquito_blade> you still have a ways to go woolie
[0:28:14] <ScreamLord> Woolie, you should do the Dark Realms
[0:28:17] <Sonny_Firestorm> I find it odd that the gold armor is a separate item and not an upgrade to the armor. (like it was in Onimusha 3)
[0:28:19] <Johannen> Is this Sekiro all over?
[0:28:20] <+Ether101_Prime> One day a map will be read.
[0:28:27] <%X2Eliah> game over?
[0:28:54] <+Ether101_Prime> ...pain.
[0:29:30] <Johannen> This cannot continue
[0:29:32] <penitentpendant> @ink_dino Which file was it?
[0:29:33] <taquito_blade> reggie is on point
[0:29:39] <ink_dino> i think it's Journal #5?
[0:29:50] <+Ether101_Prime> You can't get past the shield yet.
[0:29:56] <Johannen> It was "I dunno...find a way thru this somehow"
[0:29:57] <taquito_blade> 4?
[0:30:20] <%dreadedcthulhu> essence monkaS
[0:30:26] <taquito_blade> 3
[0:30:42] <+Ether101_Prime> They have some more stuff they need to do first.
[0:30:53] <ScreamLord> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:30:59] <ink_dino> oof, it's another note that they haven't got yet then
[0:31:21] <%X2Eliah> This game really needs a feature where you press a button and a floating blue line pops up and shows you where to go next
[0:31:30] <taquito_blade> just explore
[0:31:32] <%DegenCat> OMG you're stuck at exactly the same place I got stuck in middle school when we rented this game from blockbuster two weeks in a row and for exactly the same reason
[0:31:39] <Johannen> That what the advice was for this game no? Level up your orbs to get past doors
[0:31:41] <penitentpendant> @X2Eliah One of my more favorite features from Dead Space
[0:31:45] <ink_dino> the future is unclear
[0:31:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:31:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> We havin some directional issues?
[0:32:00] <%dreadedcthulhu> old game design NotLikeThis
[0:32:01] <taquito_blade> i do know you need a holy bow n arrow
[0:32:03] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Do the Dark Realms to get souls
[0:32:10] <+Ether101_Prime> Dark Realm and there's another door they didn't go through in the courtyard.
[0:32:38] <taquito_blade> yes n no
[0:32:48] <ink_dino> it's optional, but it's content too
[0:32:51] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You need souls for orbs
[0:32:56] <%X2Eliah> sounds optional
[0:32:57] <taquito_blade> it can give you key items end game but optional entuirely
[0:32:59] <%X2Eliah> just grinding
[0:33:06] <Johannen> Orbs for doors
[0:33:09] <+Ether101_Prime> Its optional but you get good stuff at the bottem of both all of them.
[0:33:10] <PhantomMaskJr> Aye what’s good Woolie and Reggie tagnBISON1 tagnBISON2
[0:33:11] <pi_in_the_sci> It's optional, but it's the quickest way to get orbs
[0:33:12] <ScreamLord> Optional but they aren't very long and they give you souls and items and unlocks
[0:33:16] <taquito_blade> power
[0:33:32] <+athuramn> bloody palace is optional but it's a fake option because it's the most efficient way to end up accessing lvl 3 orbs that you nesd
[0:33:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Open every door, Jamrock Shuffle style
[0:33:46] <251am> someone duct tapped the door close
[0:33:58] <taquito_blade> 3 jewel is yes limited to your power level
[0:34:03] <+athuramn> the objective is to open the 3 orb doors
[0:34:11] <+patel347> you can go to where the ninja opened doors for you
[0:34:13] <+athuramn> sort of
[0:34:16] <PhantomMaskJr> scjShrug
[0:34:21] <pi_in_the_sci> You definitely need level 3 orbs, you won't get them as quickly without Bloody Palace
[0:34:33] <taquito_blade> actually yea, woolie go to the dark realm and grind. use the souls to level the weapons V3
[0:34:35] <whirly25> "what is the point of getting stronger?" said young woolhelm, pensively
[0:34:35] <+patel347> theres also an event that opens a door
[0:34:43] <Johannen> Objective is to find a way past that hurricane door, which you dont know how to open at this point in the story so exploring is the only option
[0:34:57] <ink_dino> Yeah, there is Kaede's whole area that we haven't revisited as Sam
[0:35:25] <taquito_blade> blue door?
[0:35:28] <+patel347> yeah you can now revisit that area as sam#
[0:35:32] <Johannen> Yeah, there was some door for us in that area
[0:35:38] <%X2Eliah> pain
[0:35:55] <Sonny_Firestorm> If the dark realm in this game is the same scope as the one in 3, it should be doable in under 30 minutes.
[0:36:08] <+MrMediocrity> Onimusha? Glad to be back
[0:36:14] <+patel347> yeah this is the way
[0:36:28] <taquito_blade> you know if he had attacked the moment the axe came down he prolly wouldve issened
[0:36:41] <+patel347> use green sword for archers
[0:36:56] <%X2Eliah> this corner hallway reminds me of a sekiro spot
[0:36:58] <+patel347> the hitbox of the tornado is quite tall
[0:37:13] <taquito_blade> level up more
[0:37:20] <wolfen091> a 3 blorb door
[0:37:24] <Johannen> And that's why you need souls and level up orbs first
[0:37:31] <DaKnightWarrior> Stuff like this is why you read the Manga.
[0:37:32] <%X2Eliah> bl3rb door
[0:37:34] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Super important tip. Healing Items are finite. Use them a sparingly and spend souls to upgrade herbs into Medicine now and then
[0:37:35] <taquito_blade> dark realm grind

[0:38:15] <Johannen> Well it will be a good combat practice for Woolie
[0:38:16] <%X2Eliah> that is where progress hopefully will lie
[0:38:23] <+MugenSandan> So Onimusha has Blorbs, Rorbs and Grobs any I'm missing
[0:38:27] <ScreamLord> @ReallyBigRocks Yup lol
[0:38:30] <+Ether101_Prime> There's also a yellow door in the courtyard that you'll need to go through eventually.
[0:38:34] <%X2Eliah> Onimorbs?
[0:38:34] <penitentpendant> The awkwardness of game design when Bloody Palace becomes 'non-optional'

[0:38:47] <wolfen091> its been 19 years since I played this game, good times
[0:38:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:38:49] <Sonny_Firestorm> @MugenSandan red, blue and yellow
[0:38:49] <+patel347> theres another entrance
[0:38:51] <+patel347> right next to you
[0:38:54] <+patel347> if you dont want to reload
[0:38:57] <taquito_blade> the goal right now is to backtrack to areas that you couldnt access before and level up
[0:39:14] <+ValkyrieProfiling> !uptime
[0:39:15] <@Moobot> @ValkyrieProfiling WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 2 minutes
[0:39:30] <+patel347> you can also talk the guy in the well iirc, it leads to the same thing
[0:39:34] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Also it's what, level 20 of the Dark Realm to unlock the best weapon?
[0:39:44] <%X2Eliah> I wouldnt blame woolie if he just switched to a trading card game rn
[0:39:48] <Johannen> I only watched the Anime for this before, was it like this for the first stream
[0:39:49] <taquito_blade> i have a map!
[0:40:17] <ScreamLord> LVL2 Oni Gauntlet looks the collest
[0:40:34] <ScreamLord> It's Fake Optional
[0:40:39] <Sonny_Firestorm> Illusory Choice
[0:40:44] <pi_in_the_sci> You have to level up keys
[0:40:45] <taquito_blade> i mean, if you want bishamon..
[0:40:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> huh hah
[0:40:51] <%dreadedcthulhu> did his voice change???
[0:41:03] <%X2Eliah> what
[0:41:05] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:41:06] <%Abstract_Endurance> Abstract_Endurance subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! 
[0:41:17] <ink_dino> thing is, it is optional if you used most or all of your souls on orbs by this point
[0:41:21] <%DegenCat> it's optional in that you don't have to play the game lmao
[0:41:23] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> This is also probably good practice to get back into the combat after the break
[0:41:26] <taquito_blade> down
[0:41:26] <AnacondaVirtue> It LOOKS like Bloody Palace
[0:41:28] <Sonny_Firestorm> I'm not sure if this is a thing in the first game, but mashing X lets you suck up souls in a hurry.
[0:41:30] <+athuramn> it is optional, it would just be silly to not play it
[0:41:30] <%X2Eliah> Yeah no this forced-optional grind sucks
[0:41:31] <taquito_blade> go deeper
[0:41:31] <ink_dino> but there's also extra content at the end if you go through it all
[0:41:35] <%ThisIsLloyd> seems more like the collesium from ratchet and clank like you gotta do it but not all of it
[0:41:44] <%saladin1911> This super looks like areas inside of the Qliphoth
[0:41:57] <lotharrio> Oh he's doing the multi floor battle arena?
[0:41:57] <%X2Eliah> down is poggers
[0:42:04] <+patel347> remember to use supers for hp
[0:42:12] <%X2Eliah> @lotharrio theres noting else he can do
[0:42:14] <taquito_blade> if woolie actually manages to get Bishamon by end game ill be impressed
[0:42:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> enter the sphincter of the dark realm
[0:42:33] <ScreamLord> Woolie needs to be a little greedier for souls. Absorbing during combat is risky but you are even chances to
[0:42:49] <%X2Eliah> what
[0:42:51] <+Ether101_Prime> You can also chain issians together.
[0:42:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> Oh yes, gotta absorb during combat.
[0:42:55] <lotharrio> The dodge will require the lock-on sidestep.
[0:42:59] <+athuramn> yeah, visual confirmation is a lie in this game lol
[0:43:00] <Sonny_Firestorm> Greed is sometimes the answer.
[0:43:01] <taquito_blade> theres a sounds cue to issens
[0:43:25] <taquito_blade> its at the apex of the enemy swing to attack and a literal "whoosh"
[0:43:32] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:43:32] <Johannen> Yeah, dont use Herbs, convert them to medicine whenever you can
[0:43:43] <ScreamLord> @Ether101_Prime Chain Issen wasn't a think until Onimusha 3
[0:43:52] <taquito_blade> about 50 floors
[0:43:55] <%ThisIsLloyd> this is what's happening in your mouth Everytime you eat pop rocks
[0:43:57] <+Ether101_Prime> Are you sure?
[0:43:58] <taquito_blade> i think
[0:44:00] <+Reverend_Roscoe> QLIPHOTH
[0:44:07] <lotharrio> It's not as deep as later ones, iirc.
[0:44:16] <%MajorCrasher> drunk woolie?
[0:44:25] <Johannen> Heavy sword for heavies?
[0:44:29] <taquito_blade> ha fire
[0:44:33] <+Ether101_Prime> @lotharrio There's more then one of them .
[0:44:34] <%X2Eliah> Man, I hate having usb-c as the charging port for my laptop; 1.5 years in and it's already really loose
[0:44:45] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus If you block at the last second a ring of light flash from your guard and you can Issen from that
[0:44:50] <%dreadedcthulhu> tfw lffnHands
[0:44:50] <0rnan> Rip
[0:44:54] <taquito_blade> need to block more
[0:45:02] <%X2Eliah> you died
[0:45:03] <+Kalixas> F
[0:45:07] <Johannen> Royal Guard that Shiz
[0:45:19] <%X2Eliah> Minh with the snippy snip
[0:45:29] <%X2Eliah> Wait woolz you can heal somehow without items
[0:45:35] <%X2Eliah> idk how but somehow
[0:45:41] <lotharrio> Could grind out health by using magic on randoms and recovering from the fountain.
[0:45:52] <+patel347> theres no stamina in this game
[0:45:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[0:45:54] <+patel347> so go ham
[0:45:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> simply hit the enemies and do not get hit yourself in order to win
[0:46:31] <taquito_blade> ISSEN
[0:46:39] <taquito_blade> that was an issen
[0:46:40] <+patel347> also issen will always give you hp
[0:46:44] <%dreadedcthulhu> map button Pog
[0:46:44] <ScreamLord> Enemies also drop more souls when you crit them
[0:46:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> map combo
[0:46:49] <@Solidus_113> the death grip continues
[0:46:52] <taquito_blade> timing is key to issen
[0:47:03] <lotharrio> He's starting to believe.
[0:47:03] <%paladinstarbuster> now is the time to learn you have nothing to lose by dying
[0:47:07] <pirateofpie> Are there other areas where you can enter the dark realm or is it just this one room?
[0:47:09] <0rnan> The music and graphics are giving off some familar soul calibur vibes
[0:47:16] <Johannen> Is that a Montreal Combo Reset with L3?
[0:47:39] <%X2Eliah> da na, na na, na na, fiiighting in the naaarc reaalm!
[0:47:42] <taquito_blade> nice nice
[0:48:24] <Johannen> C-C-Combo
[0:48:26] <%X2Eliah> yeyeye
[0:48:31] <+patel347> sapm to get out of grabs
[0:48:34] <+patel347> press all buttons
[0:48:37] <+patel347> not just attack
[0:48:43] <ScreamLord> Spam ALL the buttons
[0:48:50] <%X2Eliah> Clash = super mash
[0:49:06] <0rnan> So close to the end
[0:49:06] <Johannen> Is Woolie focked on healing for the bit?
[0:49:14] <+patel347> is chest hp? I cant remember
[0:49:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> theres a chest here
[0:49:22] <ScreamLord> Green weapon's spell is good for CC
[0:49:25] <%X2Eliah> @Johannen until he learns to issen on demand
[0:49:35] <penitentpendant> Well, via google, looked up the question "I'm out of healing items and low health, what do?" top two answers...
[0:49:57] <0rnan> Yeaaaaaaaah magic pixel
[0:50:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> the tactical map button
[0:50:02] <+patel347> haha
[0:50:08] <%paladinstarbuster> gotta go back
[0:50:12] <penitentpendant> "Grind yellow souls from perfect parries" in a specific area. And "Lol just restart game."
[0:50:13] <ScreamLord> Block is also still your friend
[0:50:14] <lotharrio> one and a half bars.
[0:50:15] <pirateofpie> You'll get a healing item eventually
[0:50:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Woolie has unlocked Time Stop
[0:50:16] <%Lion_kun> Abort
[0:50:18] <%LastHazzerd> you see, the map is used for frame perfect inputs
[0:50:19] <penitentpendant> So that was unuseful
[0:50:24] <+patel347> if oyu issen you can heal
[0:50:31] <ScreamLord> You also have to start over when you go back
[0:50:33] <lotharrio> Magic fountain and magic attacks until you get drops?
[0:50:33] <+Ether101_Prime> You gett yellow souls form issens.
[0:50:34] <%paladinstarbuster> oyu issen
[0:50:39] <0rnan> No hit run from now on.
[0:50:39] <%X2Eliah> Oh no
[0:50:40] <+athuramn> you should take the souls and Issen later
[0:50:40] <+patel347> every issen gives you heals
[0:50:41] <Johannen> Yeah, so Resident Evil...restart and get good
[0:50:50] <%X2Eliah> So Woolie needs to get a "perfect" dungeon run
[0:51:05] <perritoborracho420> monkaS
[0:51:17] <%X2Eliah> Tbh this is a good time to start learning the issens
[0:51:19] <0rnan> Easy.
[0:51:35] <%saladin1911> This is kind of brutal man
[0:51:36] <%X2Eliah> Like put 10-20 minutes on issening
[0:51:42] <%X2Eliah> just to get it down
[0:51:43] <%paladinstarbuster> keep the rhythm up
[0:51:44] <ScreamLord> These guys are REALLY easy to Issen off of. Their entire spin dash is crit bait and you can even issen on their spawn animation
[0:51:44] <+athuramn> just take the exitttt
[0:51:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> BUG FLOOR
[0:51:52] <+ValkyrieProfiling> "insert Darkest Dungeon quote"
[0:51:58] <+Ether101_Prime> I found the rolling attacks one of the easiest things to issen.
[0:51:59] <+patel347> these things are fucking annoying
[0:52:12] <%X2Eliah> try harder wool
[0:52:14] <penitentpendant> I'll copy and paste the advice I found, for what it's worth...
[0:52:20] <+Ether101_Prime> Oh, yeah, this place has spoilers.
[0:52:25] <Johannen> Ohh..that stick abuse
[0:52:25] <PrideOfFiddles> So close :O
[0:52:45] <%X2Eliah> k....kurabo?
[0:52:47] <ScreamLord> Giant Enemy Ant
[0:52:51] <pirateofpie> Eventually one lower floors you'll come across a chest with a healing item and one with a revive
[0:52:51] <+athuramn> LEAAAVEEE
[0:52:53] <PrideOfFiddles> Nice :D
[0:52:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:52:53] <+patel347> remember blue souls give you meter for all weapon
[0:52:56] <Josef_Stryker> WELP
[0:52:56] <+athuramn> oh my god
[0:52:57] <casualshinji> Losing IS winning.
[0:52:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> Is this EDF?
[0:53:01] <0rnan> Hey a flying dude. Great.
[0:53:17] <AnacondaVirtue> Tornado
[0:53:18] <%X2Eliah> yeeee camera
[0:53:22] <%LastHazzerd> that's an SMT demon
[0:53:32] <Ziegsy> its legion!
[0:53:45] <%X2Eliah> This is Woolie's anime strive arc
[0:53:47] <0rnan> Life is overrated.
[0:53:49] <LaughinJester> hello everyone! hey woolie
[0:53:51] <ink_dino> you might be able to level one of the orbs up tho
[0:53:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Tough crowd
[0:53:53] <+yukichocomilk> this is agony LUL
[0:53:55] <%paladinstarbuster> sasageyo
[0:54:02] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Skull Balls multiply the souls they absorb and you can use either Absorb to draw them closer or use the Bow
[0:54:03] <dromemer3> you got this!!
[0:54:05] <%paladinstarbuster> gotta issen
[0:54:06] <penitentpendant> Relaying Advice: "Go to one of the starting areas, the gate right outside the main hall. There's a magic mirror right inside the main hall in one of the side rooms and save there."
[0:54:07] <+ValkyrieProfiling> gotta issen
[0:54:08] <lotharrio> Sasuga, Capcom.
[0:54:09] <0rnan> 1 HP run.
[0:54:11] <DaKnightWarrior> You can't escape!
[0:54:12] <+Hawksworthers> dont the counters drop health?
[0:54:12] <+athuramn> They're gonna lose it all for no reason
[0:54:18] <pirateofpie> Get the chest!
[0:54:21] <%paladinstarbuster> its fine woolie
[0:54:24] <Johannen> YEYEYYE
[0:54:29] <+patel347> use it usae it
[0:54:30] <+patel347> use it
[0:54:33] <JetpackMcQuack> down the hatch LUL
[0:54:36] <+patel347> saved run
[0:54:37] <Equirah> 4 hours for a 30 min episode let's go! LUL
[0:54:39] <AnacondaVirtue> Back in the game
[0:54:40] <lotharrio> Full commit
[0:54:43] <dukenux> oh it wasnt that bad
[0:55:06] <ink_dino> yah, spinning the analog while mashing also helps
[0:55:21] <pirateofpie> That tracking
[0:55:24] <LaughinJester> yikes
[0:55:24] <%paladinstarbuster> why is woolie pausing?
[0:55:28] <%X2Eliah> lul
[0:55:48] <+athuramn> the map is pulled up on l3 so he hits it by mistake @paladinstarbuster
[0:55:57] <dukenux> new strats
[0:56:01] <ScreamLord> Green Spell also good for Skull Orbs
[0:56:02] <0rnan> Oh its the classic fight. Smough & Smough.
[0:56:06] <pirateofpie> The chest
[0:56:08] <Equirah> LUL
[0:56:11] <%paladinstarbuster> Ah I thought it was some cool strAts
[0:56:17] <dukenux> fucking bdsm tauren
[0:56:26] <+yukichocomilk> yeah i thought he was timing the blocks or something
[0:56:34] <Johannen> Woolie knew that he cannot change controls: So, instead of reflecting on themselves, he blamed the tank controls
[0:56:35] <DaKnightWarrior> This is chaos LUL
[0:56:39] <Equirah> you got out of the corner LUL
[0:56:43] <+patel347> maybe dip after the medicine?
[0:56:47] <%LastHazzerd> Chaos
[0:56:50] <+athuramn> there was also another chest 👀
[0:56:58] <+patel347> although the end is the greatest reward
[0:57:02] <+Ether101_Prime> I bet you get all 20 levels this time.
[0:57:10] <%X2Eliah> this is literally a difficulty spike
[0:57:16] <+patel347> it was probably for an achievement
[0:57:23] <ink_dino> this is the training arc
[0:57:34] <ScreamLord> Whoever decided to put the Map on L3 is a sociopath
[0:57:44] <+athuramn> they let you leave the gauntlet to get your experience
[0:57:48] <+patel347> there is 20 levels
[0:57:51] <ink_dino> it isn't the only way, you can also farm outside the demon realm to level one of the orbs (i'd recommend the fire one first)
[0:57:53] <Johannen> It would not have been mandatory if you upgraded the orbs first
[0:58:00] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It looks like there's healing on levels 9, 14, 16, and 18
[0:58:06] <taquito_blade> wait doesnt it perma close after at some point?
[0:58:07] <AnacondaVirtue> [SPOILERS] There's something really good at the bottom.
[0:58:13] <lotharrio> If you want to grind, you can do so pretty easily by mashing magic.
[0:58:19] <dukenux> there better be!
[0:58:25] <ScreamLord> Dark Realm reset when you leave
[0:58:30] <taquito_blade> ok good
[0:58:40] <penitentpendant> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx This is important: Do those items restock if he revisits them in another run?
[0:58:51] <taquito_blade> no they dont
[0:58:55] <penitentpendant> Sigh
[0:58:57] <casualshinji> There's no reason not to magic it up with the elite dudes here.
[0:59:41] <pirateofpie> They don't restock? I could've sworn they did
[0:59:50] <ink_dino> they don't, i'm pretty sure
[1:00:29] <Johannen> Hell yue
[1:00:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:00:48] <pirateofpie> Hmm
[1:01:43] <%livlinn> woolieYE woolieGLORY
[1:02:21] <+patel347> might aswell finish it
[1:02:25] <+patel347> it gives better damage
[1:02:25] <Nightflier1> Nightflier1 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:02:51] <penitentpendant> Save in a different slot?
[1:03:01] <penitentpendant> Since you have less HP
[1:03:04] <+patel347> you can farm outside the zlne
[1:03:20] <+patel347> but the bottom on the palace gives a good reward
[1:03:44] <ink_dino> you can also do big grind cheats in the room you're in, since there's a magic-refilling pool in the room right next to it
[1:04:03] <+patel347> might aswell kill them you need the souls
[1:04:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> This is turning into a no hit challenge run
[1:04:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> will Woolie EVER find more healing?
[1:04:49] <+patel347> if oyu saved him, he might have given you a healing item
[1:04:54] <pi_in_the_sci> IF you help friendly soldiers they GIVE YOU HEALING
[1:05:09] <%saladin1911> "Every man for himself!" said the hero
[1:05:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck go back!
[1:05:23] <+patel347> green sword
[1:05:26] <+patel347> use tornado
[1:05:28] <+patel347> for archers
[1:05:41] <Omenaire> he dead
[1:06:20] <lotharrio> More health than you had.
[1:06:29] <+patel347> you dont get healing inside bloody palace without issen
[1:06:36] <+patel347> outside you can randomly get yellow souls
[1:07:24] <JojoAndTheAfroRobo> 1hp and a dream

[1:08:51] <lotharrio> You're getting souls. You're healing during combat.
[1:08:52] <Johannen> Gettins souls and healing , not that bad
[1:08:53] <ink_dino> that area is the prison
[1:09:20] <+athuramn> who suggested not doing bloody palace smh
[1:09:24] <%saladin1911> It seems like literally nobody knows what to actually do in this game LUL
[1:09:42] <+athuramn> should be slapped upside the head for the terrible suggestion
[1:09:47] <%X2Eliah> @saladin1911 Yeah that sho wit is with old clunky jank games
[1:09:54] <penitentpendant> @saladin1911 The advice I pulled up was the only entry, and it came from a year ago
[1:10:17] <%X2Eliah> MR SNIP SNIP
[1:10:36] <%saladin1911> I thought this was a beloved game that people were excited for? But nobody has any legit info. Not blaming anybody, just funny to me
[1:10:55] <penitentpendant> @saladin1911 Sounds like 'Nostalgia 101'
[1:11:02] <%X2Eliah> would it?
[1:11:05] <%X2Eliah> rly?
[1:11:10] <%HeroToxiko> yup
[1:11:15] <pi_in_the_sci> There are some heals outside, you can go save that soldier now
[1:11:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> huh hah
[1:11:16] <drunken_lemur> Yes
[1:11:25] <JeoDood> could spam supers near the save room
[1:11:26] <dukenux> he's getting pumped for the palaca
[1:11:27] <%HeroToxiko> he even did a lil spinn
[1:11:30] <dukenux> *palace
[1:11:43] <Johannen> Woolie just came playing killer games so he gotta learn his basics
[1:11:59] <lotharrio> I dunno. I'd grind against those monsters right outside the room with magic until my health looked okay. But that's probably a boring stream/video.
[1:12:28] <ink_dino> there is also royal guard in this game
[1:12:30] <Johannen> @lotharrio Woolie is trying to save time. Which is ironic
[1:12:51] <penitentpendant> @lotharrio The morton's fork is if you die in the palace you make zero headway. There's no good solution here, honestly.
[1:13:24] <howdoipunch> you are getting some small heals occasionally
[1:13:35] <penitentpendant> So I find no fault in any choice here
[1:13:37] <Johannen> @howdoipunch Thats from issen
[1:13:38] <pi_in_the_sci> These guys are easy to dodge issen
[1:13:49] <+Hawksworthers> the counters drop heals
[1:13:49] <%X2Eliah> The good solution is to do a Sekiro and put this game on ice for a year
[1:14:16] <%Lion_kun> A year? It was 3 years.
[1:14:44] <%Lion_kun> 2 years*
[1:14:47] <%saladin1911> Oh yeah, I should watch that Sekiro playthrough since I'd never play it myself
[1:15:06] <Johannen> That Sekiro playthrou is cursed
[1:15:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[1:15:24] <%saladin1911> @johannen So I've heard LUL
[1:15:27] <%DegenCat> Is there an "execute knocked down enemy" animation in this game?
[1:15:29] <ink_dino> you can also issen when they're spawning, for some reason
[1:15:54] <penitentpendant> @ink_dino It might be they're in an 'active state' when spawning which is flagged for counters?
[1:15:55] <%paladinstarbuster> @DegenCat yes
[1:15:59] <lotharrio> Dodge issens are a thing, but there's no i-frames, I believe.
[1:16:53] <%paladinstarbuster> yes'
[1:17:10] <%DegenCat> @paladinstarbuster Is it bad or something? I feel like he could be getting some use out of it.
[1:17:19] <pi_in_the_sci> Soul sucking drags them towards you
[1:17:37] <shiniakovos> @lotharrio i just read that as i-no frames
[1:17:48] <shiniakovos> ive been playing too much strive istg
[1:17:55] <+RaidouKuzunoha> i just got off playing strive to watch lmao
[1:18:06] <%paladinstarbuster> @DegenCat you can get hit during it so yu have to use it when safe
[1:18:07] <verscoll> PogChamp
[1:18:08] <+Ether101_Prime> And I think you can issen them while their trying to escape in this game.
[1:18:12] <%saladin1911> @degencat He's been trying. It's kinda jank getting the right position for it, it seems
[1:18:20] <ink_dino> there's an item there
[1:18:21] <Johannen> Heal
[1:18:22] <pi_in_the_sci> BOX
[1:18:24] <penitentpendant> @shiniakovos At least it's not "totsugeki!"
[1:18:32] <lotharrio> Save before you use it.
[1:18:36] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> 9
[1:18:36] <Omenaire> keep going!
[1:18:43] <%DegenCat> ahhhhhhh I understand, thanks fam! @paladinstarbuster @saladin1911
[1:18:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Cashing in your issen experience too
[1:18:51] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[1:18:52] <shiniakovos> @penitentpendant may is my secondary after ino so idk man haha
[1:18:57] <%zanz_san> Cash in
[1:19:00] <%X2Eliah> go up save and grind outside
[1:19:06] <+RaidouKuzunoha> speaking of strive do u guys think nago vs ino is nago sided or ino sided
[1:19:11] <Prevot> LUL
[1:19:14] <lotharrio> Listen to these silly billies in here.
[1:19:16] <%X2Eliah> dunk on nago
[1:19:25] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @fetrigon
[1:19:28] <%X2Eliah> nago vs. anything is not nago sided
[1:19:43] <%X2Eliah> The only matchup that is nago sided is nago vs. nago
[1:19:44] <+fetrigon> @moobot sorry NotLikeThis
[1:19:57] <%saladin1911> Unless your you're Fame96, Nago seems rough aha
[1:20:03] <%dreadedcthulhu> @x2eliah supernoon thinks ram v nago is rough for ram
[1:20:12] <penitentpendant> @shiniakovos I don't follow Strive much, is there a 'dolphin greeting' among Mays like there's a 'Potbuster Trade' among Potemkins?
[1:20:12] <%DegenCat> caterpillarn't
[1:20:16] <%zanz_san> that was a good run
[1:20:27] <%X2Eliah> Tbh Nago was simply nerfed to balance out the weeb-appeal
[1:20:49] <shiniakovos> @penitentpendant to my experience, there is simply no mercy
[1:21:16] <+RaidouKuzunoha> if you play nago vs ino u def have some tools to deal with inos main ways of getting in but ino's 6p is really good
[1:21:16] <%saladin1911> Yo, Woolie's gonna come out of this Bloody Palace a scarred veteran of war
[1:21:25] <%X2Eliah> It's *wild* that Woolie hasnt played much striive tbh
[1:21:26] <shiniakovos> oi nago downplayers need to not, he's dumb strong
[1:21:56] <%dreadedcthulhu> lots of pro players are saying nago is mad good
[1:21:59] <%LordSDB> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[1:22:08] <ink_dino> oh, levelling orbs also level up your magic, btw
[1:22:08] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:22:24] <shiniakovos> @raidoukuzunoha ino's 6P is great but doesn't help at all in the matchup. it's imo one of her hardest
[1:22:27] <lotharrio> You filled up about 1/3 from the first floor and another 1/3 from the second. Both are basically safe.
[1:22:32] <+RaidouKuzunoha> i think nago is really good just complex due to his macro
[1:22:44] <pi_in_the_sci> Those big red hat guys are dodge issen training dummies
[1:23:06] <+RaidouKuzunoha> @shiniakovos true enough he was 6Ping my 6P and it was rough, and nago 5K is a really powerful tool too - its just generally hard to get the ball rolling on him
[1:23:31] <%dreadedcthulhu> PogChamp
[1:23:37] <Johannen> Reggie is saving the stream again
[1:23:41] <penitentpendant> Woolie Leveling up his skills
[1:24:11] <%DegenCat> Onimusha is the true Demons' Souls
[1:24:11] <%thedankestmeeme> old age demon souls niceuu
[1:24:16] <lotharrio> He's starting to believe...
[1:24:17] <Johannen> Tank controls are THE way to go
[1:24:18] <ScreamLord> Onimusha was Soulsborne before Soulsborne was a twinkle is Miyazaki's eye
[1:24:28] <crimsonsaens> Why are these fight rooms 2 camera angles?
[1:24:30] <+RaidouKuzunoha> this game was my childhood such a banger. 3 is my favorite
[1:24:35] <shiniakovos> @raidoukuzunoha once you're in its party time, but until then you spend all your time trying to low profile with H Stroke for a counter hit combo into note oki or a frame trap, or plinking away at him with chemical love in my experience
[1:24:37] <penitentpendant> The lab has more teeth than I remember
[1:24:48] <%DegenCat> ^^^^^lmao
[1:25:04] <+Ether101_Prime> Does this game have a multiplier for the number of souls you suck in at once?
[1:25:29] <lotharrio> There's the knock down.
[1:25:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @Ether101_Prime no, but you do seem to get more souls, especially health ones, for counters
[1:25:39] <ScreamLord> Tank Controls are better for combat purposes, and they don't trigger the map
[1:25:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> or issens or whatever
[1:25:46] <Johannen> Woolie sounds like buffer is a good thing in souls)
[1:25:48] <+RaidouKuzunoha> @shiniakovos the problem im having is that H stroke will get you fucked most of the time because he has a bunch of low hitting buttons that blow it up, chemical love does work thoug. im also at the lvl where people throw h stroke semi consistently
[1:26:00] <pi_in_the_sci> The skull ball enemies are soul multipliers, they give you something like twice as many souls as the eat
[1:26:05] <+Ether101_Prime> @fruit_pie_the_magician Okay. A lot of this information seemed to be hard to find for some reason.
[1:26:14] <+RaidouKuzunoha> but due to that, H stroke PRC throw now has the most mileage out of any of my meter options. i literally never saw the nago tech it lol
[1:26:49] <%saladin1911> You should always let the floaters suck in orbs since they multiply them tbh
[1:26:49] <shiniakovos> @raidoukuzunoha you need to rotate your options so it's not predictable bc he does have things like 2S which will just blow it up
[1:26:54] <%HeroToxiko> Now that i think f it, beating the onimusha series definitely made dark souls feel like a regular game
[1:26:55] <lotharrio> Okay the medicine respawns? Now it's a whole new ballgame.
[1:28:21] <penitentpendant> Time to farm 'Bloody Palace' for medicine
[1:28:27] <shiniakovos> @raidoukuzunoha just remember that h stroke is +2 on block, and you can frame trap into 2K and 5K, followed by 6H and can literally just repeat that once or twice to condition them to block, after which they will likely get frustrated and try to jab mash out or smth, at which point you hoverdash into mixup in neutral
[1:28:49] <pi_in_the_sci> That big overhead is worth baiting out to dodge
[1:28:58] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus If I were you I'd learn how to use the Tank Controls for combat. They're better than the Stick is for it and you don't trigger that Map
[1:29:10] <+RaidouKuzunoha> @shiniakovos yea for sure. glad i got the mu exp because i dont see him too often for whatever reason. at least he explodes once you get in on him i think he blocked like 3 mixup attempts after 2D note lol
[1:29:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:29:12] <dukenux> its always the same finds, irsnt it
[1:29:15] <lotharrio> I think 3 was enough last time?
[1:29:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 3 full levels is good
[1:29:20] <+Reisadan> Samonosuke vs Heavy Thumbs; FIGHT!
[1:29:36] <shiniakovos> @raidoukuzunoha lol I'm jealous, I see him all the time on EU floor 9
[1:30:04] <pi_in_the_sci> At least now you can grab up a bunch of medicine off stream
[1:30:11] <%saladin1911> Perfectly planned
[1:30:11] <%DegenCat> cutting it close there
[1:30:13] <lotharrio> Okay so it's closer to 3.5 or 4 bars.
[1:30:15] <+Reisadan> Worst fuel efficiency than a Hummer
[1:30:41] <+RaidouKuzunoha> @shiniakovos yea i just get pot players and all of them are actually bad so i was boosted to floor 9 by them (USW)
[1:31:09] <shiniakovos> @raidoukuzunoha pots are unicorns for me, only things rarer are axl and zato
[1:31:47] <shiniakovos> @raidoukuzunoha although saying that i hardly ever come up on an ino mirror
[1:32:04] <+Reisadan> All these Japanese period drama angles are semi-nostalgic
[1:32:26] <Johannen> It is if you are good
[1:32:41] <crimsonsaens> I've yet to find a single Faust
[1:32:53] <shiniakovos> i see faust a fair bit
[1:32:58] <%HeroToxiko> HAAAAHAA
[1:33:05] <lotharrio> Random drops instead, then?
[1:33:12] <Johannen> Its not random
[1:33:12] <shiniakovos> must be really different in different regions
[1:33:22] <Johannen> He gives you Burst bullets
[1:33:23] <+RaidouKuzunoha> @shiniakovos ive seen 1 of each axl zato and ino and all of them were bad lol. like got hoverdash j.h in neutral bad
[1:33:30] <dukenux> chat full of one guys tonight
[1:33:35] <%DegenCat> "Explosive Rounds Are A Healing Item Actually" --chat
[1:33:40] <+athuramn> imagine if you could farm the bloody palace for medicine...
[1:34:00] <%HeroToxiko> i played the series in high school and i barely remember anything about it besides being frustrated, no advice from me
[1:34:23] <ScreamLord> Now you can see Flourite spawns
[1:34:26] <lotharrio> I only played this one once when it came out.
[1:34:28] <%HeroToxiko> There might be a map that tells you which boxes has what item on "gamefaqa" tho
[1:34:51] <lotharrio> O2, O3 and ODoD I played a lot of, but those were still ages ago.
[1:34:52] <+Reisadan> So this flourite, does it glisten your teeth.
[1:35:07] <zanzibarian_hamster> Does that staff radiate frog gayness
[1:35:44] <%zanz_san> it's a Nioh statue the Nioh of the West, William in Nioh 1.
[1:35:51] <ink_dino> oh
[1:35:54] <%X2Eliah> speaking of frog gayness, apparently alex jones is now into public feet sniffing
[1:35:58] <ink_dino> so that's what the vision staff does
[1:36:18] <%zanz_san> Protag of Nioh 2 is Nioh of the East
[1:36:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:36:27] <+Reisadan> At least you get more health than you loose if you only get arrowed once.
[1:36:38] <+Reisadan> loose = lose
[1:36:39] <%saladin1911> Rooms changing colour in the Map when you've picked up all items is the best addition this this sort of game
[1:36:44] <ScreamLord> Well
[1:36:51] <Johannen> Is Well progress?
[1:37:06] <ScreamLord> No another Dark Realm
[1:37:11] <Johannen> ohhh
[1:37:17] <lotharrio> But would it have a magic pool?
[1:37:22] <lotharrio> Oh nevermind
[1:37:24] <shiniakovos> I'm convinced Zato is the best char in the game
[1:37:42] <+Reisadan> no that's gogendantes
[1:37:44] <%X2Eliah> poggers
[1:37:59] <ScreamLord> It's satisfyingly when you absorb a fuckton of souls at once like that
[1:38:04] <%X2Eliah> orb is orb
[1:38:10] <+Ether101_Prime> Is the Dark Realm in the well the same gauntlet?
[1:38:47] <pi_in_the_sci> Yeah, that NPC always sends you to one place

[1:39:03] <%paladinstarbuster> you can heal from enemies though
[1:39:10] <%X2Eliah> .... is onimusha more dark souls than dark souls?
[1:39:11] <Johannen> It is intended for you to reload your saves often if you make mistakes or waste items
[1:39:13] <ink_dino> da rope
[1:39:16] <JeoDood> resident evil
[1:39:19] <lotharrio> You got two hits in you, at least.
[1:39:23] <dukenux> yo
[1:39:31] <dukenux> i love eniromental kills
[1:39:32] <penitentpendant> Go save
[1:39:36] <%dreadedcthulhu> FREE
[1:39:42] <%zanz_san> Hey Woolie, do you have an opinion on Gundam Hathaway coming to Netflix?
[1:39:42] <%saladin1911> I hate when games give you full health on respawn.
[1:39:47] <ScreamLord> Imagine if Capcom actually made a Soulsborne Onimusha game around the time Nioh came out
[1:39:50] <%DegenCat> OH NO
[1:39:54] <%DegenCat> LOLOLOL I'M SO EXCITED
[1:40:01] <lotharrio> Now... I wonder what happens with their respawn.
[1:40:33] <%DegenCat> oh man nvm i thought this was a totally different room lol
[1:40:42] <%DegenCat> it has been forever with this game lol
[1:40:48] <%X2Eliah> ye ye ye ye
[1:40:50] <dukenux> worth it
[1:40:56] <%X2Eliah> HP UP
[1:40:58] <%DegenCat> WHAT'S
[1:40:59] <%DegenCat> UP
[1:40:59] <dukenux> uh oh
[1:41:00] <%DegenCat> FELLAS
[1:41:02] <+Reisadan> YES.
[1:41:02] <lotharrio> Well that's a rough room.
[1:41:04] <ScreamLord> Woolie's gonna LOVE Chain-Crits in Oni3
[1:41:18] <lotharrio> @ScreamLord I don't think he's gonna get there.
[1:41:20] <dukenux> id take the relic for now and get outta here LUL
[1:41:23] <Make_me_mad> Did woolie still never learn to lock on and dodge?
[1:41:34] <%paladinstarbuster> stop giving them your back just block
[1:41:35] <%X2Eliah> @lotharrio give it 5 more years
[1:41:37] <Johannen> Woolie eating his share of tracking overheads
[1:42:08] <AnacondaVirtue> Is that the Seven-Pronged Sword in the ground
[1:42:12] <%X2Eliah> that s a 360
[1:42:18] <+Ether101_Prime> You can't issen bosses in this game.
[1:42:25] <%thedankestmeeme> LOL
[1:42:35] <ScreamLord> Yes you can
[1:42:36] <%X2Eliah> womp woooom
[1:42:38] <pi_in_the_sci> You need to dadge those guys
[1:42:47] <+Selectamo> just ?tuned in, why the pausing
[1:42:54] <%Mathochism> woolieONEGUY
[1:42:56] <%dreadedcthulhu> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[1:42:58] <taquito_blade> its true tho
[1:42:59] <%HeroToxiko> OneHand
[1:43:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the duality of woolieONEGUY
[1:43:01] <ink_dino> two guys enter, one guy leaves
[1:43:04] <%HeroToxiko> woolieONEGUY
[1:43:07] <Johannen> @Selectamo Woolie pushes in his left stick too much which is MAP
[1:43:08] <JeoDood> ban them
[1:43:10] <+Reisadan> Heavy Thumb Saga
[1:43:16] <dukenux> which guy is the one guy tho
[1:43:20] <+Selectamo> haha ok I thought it was some tech
[1:43:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[1:43:25] <lotharrio> There's very few enemies you can't issen in this series.
[1:43:26] <penitentpendant> Honestly, you could almost farm this room for HP
[1:43:28] <taquito_blade> you dont have to be in stance to use issen
[1:43:29] <%X2Eliah> idk I feel woolie is trying to animation cancel with that pause
[1:43:39] <ScreamLord> The collective Gestalt of Chat-chan is chaotic and contradictory
[1:43:53] <PMda2nd> big, not big big
[1:44:00] <%emperordread> emperordread subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! You and Reggie can choose up to 2 anime waifus. Who you callin dibs on?
[1:44:05] <penitentpendant> @ScreamLord A multiheaded hydra is apropos
[1:44:37] <PMda2nd> nice
[1:44:41] <shiniakovos> @emperordread any answer other than senjougahara twice is facually wrong
[1:44:51] <penitentpendant> Full health!
[1:44:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice
[1:44:53] <ink_dino> big plays
[1:45:05] <ink_dino> also free lvl3 wind orb if you wanna drop all your swords in it
[1:45:08] <penitentpendant> Reminds me of Okami, honestly
[1:45:10] <ink_dino> *souls
[1:45:10] <Johannen> You mean the lightning sword from korea?
[1:45:10] <@Solidus_113> that's a real sword
[1:45:12] <BlackermanZX> its the amaterasu sword
[1:45:12] <lotharrio> Well there's that magic pool not too far from here.
[1:45:15] <dukenux> that looks like a roast rack
[1:45:15] <taquito_blade> that sword in alot of games now that i look at it
[1:45:23] <%DegenCat> wait isn't the gun way earlier than this?
[1:45:29] <TimeWanderer> Catherine uses that sword in FE:3H.
[1:45:30] <Applecannon63> the seven branched seord
[1:45:35] <SethYuikora> So Woolie, what's the difference between Onimusha and Warlords? I know Warlords had an extra armor or something. Or is this your first time playing?
[1:45:37] <penitentpendant> @dukenux Think of the number of marshmellows you could multi-toast!
[1:45:52] <ScreamLord> Okami was the only game to have the 7-Branch Sword actually be usable. No Nioh 2 doesn't count because it's used as an ability
[1:46:10] <penitentpendant> Full health though, excellent time to save
[1:46:23] <Applecannon63> the 7-branched sword also known as the fake murder weapon on ace attourney
[1:46:36] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Upgrade consumables
[1:46:41] <%X2Eliah> ok all orbs up time to progress
[1:46:45] <+Reisadan> Ninja Gaiden has the Dark Dragon Blade.
[1:46:50] <+Reisadan> It is an ingredient in tea.
[1:46:52] <SethYuikora> Enryuu does great damage overall
[1:47:00] <crimsonsaens> According to gamefaqs, there's only 1 boss you can Issen in this game
[1:47:09] <lotharrio> Herb to Medicine makes sense.
[1:47:09] <BlackermanZX> man that last case in ace attorney 3 is wild
[1:47:15] <ScreamLord> @Reisadan Oh yeah I forgot about that
[1:47:19] <pi_in_the_sci> It's sort of worth it for meds
[1:47:29] <rReizs> woolie's goblins are consumables
[1:47:30] <Applecannon63> Wait didn't Obito wield the Seven Branch Sword…
[1:47:38] <Johannen> If you not upgrading them you are wasting items prety much
[1:47:52] <Rwbyrocks> 7 branched sword
[1:48:04] <lotharrio> Souls are infinite though.
[1:48:07] <PMda2nd> weapons first
[1:48:08] <zanzibarian_hamster> Souls come back
[1:48:11] <%paladinstarbuster> not right
[1:48:14] <Johannen> Souls come back items dont
[1:48:14] <%X2Eliah> souls are game time
[1:48:15] <taquito_blade> no souls are infinite and do not matter in the long run
[1:48:17] <RamenRiderZ> 7 branched sword AKA the hat rack sword
[1:48:18] <+Reisadan> Souls are 'infinite'
[1:48:25] <SethYuikora> Most boss fights can be trivialized by spamming magic and swapping weapons
[1:48:27] <ScreamLord> Souls are infinite, herbs are not
[1:48:29] <+Ether101_Prime> Souls are infinite, healing items aren't.
[1:48:29] <+kevlarkoala> Pat's energy has reached Woolie's home
[1:48:30] <taquito_blade> upgrade everything whenever possilble
[1:48:37] <pi_in_the_sci> With the bloody palace, meds are infinite as well
[1:48:58] <ScreamLord> @Ether101_Prime Stop almost reading my mind
[1:49:11] <%saladin1911> You say souls are infinite but Woolie isn't playing this game in his own time to grind and do whatever. He's trying to keep things relatively concise
[1:49:15] <+Ether101_Prime> Its time.
[1:49:15] <taquito_blade> theres the rifle
[1:49:15] <%X2Eliah> wow
[1:49:17] <djblue_shift> i love how the weapons transform as you level them up
[1:49:23] <rReizs> so every time a herb is used for a partial heal it could have been a medicine for a full heal?
[1:49:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GUN
[1:49:26] <ink_dino> [GUN]
[1:49:28] <%DegenCat> GUN
[1:49:29] <AnacondaVirtue> The best power: GUN
[1:49:31] <Johannen> Heal more and do more damage with limited arrows and bullets....that's not a waste
[1:49:32] <Rwbyrocks> Gun acquired
[1:49:32] <SethYuikora> you are brave
[1:49:36] <PMda2nd> goon
[1:49:39] <JeoDood> gun
[1:49:39] <+Reisadan> and thus Samanosuke does what a child could not; do Legends of the Hidden Temple correctly
[1:49:42] <Applecannon63> ITS NOW RE
[1:49:43] <%X2Eliah> MATLOCK? I LOVED THAT SHOW
[1:49:51] <ScreamLord> The Genma can never defeat GUN
[1:49:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> Even THE sword master said that guns are king
[1:49:58] <Rwbyrocks> Bang
[1:50:00] <SethYuikora> no reload animation, just more gun
[1:50:00] <+DJSummers101> GUN.
[1:50:00] <%paladinstarbuster> The japanese loved guns
[1:50:01] <Applecannon63> WE'RE RE NOW
[1:50:02] <%X2Eliah> 9 bullets
[1:50:05] <PMda2nd> Rickkkkkkkeeeeyyyyyyy
[1:50:07] <ExpressNode> Shoot it sideways
[1:50:14] <Johannen> Guns are cool said japanese
[1:50:23] <Applecannon63> ONIMUSHA:RESIDENT EVIL
[1:50:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:50:24] <+Ether101_Prime> Courtyard time.
[1:50:28] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Sword
[1:50:32] <taquito_blade> no
[1:50:34] <lotharrio> Something with that Naruto sword
[1:50:36] <ScreamLord> Nobunaga is a HUGE boner for gun
[1:50:39] <taquito_blade> you need ritual bow n arrow
[1:50:41] <rReizs> surprise the japanese also used spears a LOT
[1:50:49] <%X2Eliah> LUL shoot the door yeah thjat will work
[1:50:51] <RamenRiderZ> IT'S THE NATURE OF TIME
[1:51:13] <ScreamLord> Why do aUSE GUN
[1:51:15] <%X2Eliah> It's a very Japanese solution, if it doesn't work, shoot it xD
[1:51:24] <penitentpendant> Not enough suction to be useful
[1:51:36] <%X2Eliah> 8 bullets
[1:51:44] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus You have to use Green Spell or Gun/Bow on the Skull Orbs
[1:51:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> "From inside fortifications, the gun has no equal among weapons."- some dual wielding sword guy
[1:52:10] <ExpressNode> Woolie truly is the Last Samurai
[1:52:43] <penitentpendant> "It's so... ugly... and impractical... go away..."
[1:52:44] <+Mkingston> It looks like the Red Ranger sword
[1:52:51] <RamenRiderZ> Warriors complaining about archers were the OG Scrubquotes
[1:52:55] <+Ether101_Prime> There's another door in the courtyard.
[1:52:57] <+Reisadan> "This sword has excellent balance" -guy who bought it in a mall
[1:52:58] <ink_dino> i think you guys missed the corridor that needed it entirely
[1:53:02] <Omenaire> the well is just more dark realm
[1:53:06] <+Mkingston> praying for Onimusha 2
[1:53:22] <+Greenkap> thatsa real sword, it was a gift from a korean kingdom to the japanese empress
[1:53:24] <Applecannon63> Seven Branch Sword kinda cool when its made out of jade
[1:53:29] <seriousink> god this part is so unintuitive
[1:53:29] <Johannen> Google says the item for progression is in east map? Would that be corect universe?
[1:53:40] <taquito_blade> YEA STASB THAT BITCH
[1:53:52] <penitentpendant> "Behold! I've class changed my class to Ranged Proctologist!" ~Some Archer Outside A Save Room
[1:54:01] <Zeif00> Woolie you're in UltraKill :O
[1:54:01] <taquito_blade> oh the second dark realm entrance
[1:54:17] <+CookieCutter007> have you heard of the high elves
[1:54:20] <AnacondaVirtue> There's something real good down there
[1:54:21] <%X2Eliah> oh its just dork realm
[1:54:21] <taquito_blade> closer to ultimate power
[1:54:24] <rReizs> oh yeah guy dark realm sure paradise
[1:54:29] <+Reisadan> this guy makes no sense, look at him upside down
[1:54:32] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus The courtyard of the castle has the door where you can use your sword
[1:54:40] <taquito_blade> yes
[1:55:00] <Omenaire> its the same
[1:55:01] <taquito_blade> the darker realm cuz its deeper than the last
[1:56:15] <+Reisadan> I forget, can you block blade strikes
[1:56:31] <Johannen> Right area, check the corners
[1:56:36] <taquito_blade> man this really makes me wanna play Onimusha 2
[1:56:38] <Applecannon63> Seven branch would be useful if the branches were arranged better for parrying
[1:56:44] <+Ether101_Prime> There's two yellow doors you didn't go through yet on the map.
[1:57:45] <Johannen> Progress is being made

[1:57:47] <Blank9> onimusha 2 was an amazing sequel
[1:57:48] <%keiji_maede> keiji_maede subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:57:57] <seriousink> lol there it is
[1:58:02] <DatAsuna> this music actually reminds me a lot of a certain god eater song
[1:58:20] <rReizs> the only GOOD bug is a DEAD bug
[1:58:25] <lotharrio> Oh look that that! Indent for a Naruto.
[1:58:37] <penitentpendant> So the event was 'Camera Triggered'? That's weird.
[1:58:58] <taquito_blade> youll go there soo
[1:58:58] <seriousink> "so should we put this bug breaking through the gate on the map somewhere?" "...nah, they'll figure it out"
[1:59:00] <taquito_blade> soon*
[1:59:01] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You are going to the East Area right now
[1:59:23] <AnacondaVirtue> Wait what the fuck it's missing a prong
[1:59:24] <+patel347> iirc this is behind one of the 3 orb doors
[1:59:33] <+Greenkap> flamberge
[1:59:37] <Johannen> Flamberge
[1:59:38] <penitentpendant> One of them is an actual weapon
[1:59:38] <lotharrio> Flamberge
[1:59:39] <PMda2nd> flam
[1:59:42] <%X2Eliah> flamberge
[1:59:45] <TonberryLives> Flamberge
[1:59:48] <+Exicuren> The Flamberge, that is an actua weapon
[1:59:52] <Applecannon63> Flamberge
[1:59:54] <+patel347> oh he already gotit
[1:59:55] <%paladinstarbuster> ITS A DECRATIVE SWORD
[1:59:57] <+Greenkap> flamberges were real
[2:00:01] <+Greenkap> they work like normal swords
[2:00:07] <+Greenkap> there were flamberge rapiers
[2:00:07] <+Kalixas> Real ceremonial
[2:00:15] <Blank9> you can pretend the flamberge is the soul reaver
[2:00:16] <%X2Eliah> That's the biggest thing, *flamberges are a real weapon*
[2:00:24] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:00:29] <Asuterisuku> "Pre-rendered." Last time Woolie said that he got a face full of demon.
[2:00:44] <rReizs> royalty weren't actually going to smack people with their sceptres
[2:00:53] <ScreamLord> 7-Strike was never meant to be a real weapon. The Flamberge was.
[2:00:55] <%X2Eliah> doppel örb
[2:01:05] <Johannen> Fluids?
[2:01:05] <PMda2nd> face full of d emons
[2:01:08] <Applecannon63> The seven branch sword only looks cool if it was made into jade
[2:01:17] <ScreamLord> bow
[2:01:24] <Blank9> Is this the ps2 version or HD?
[2:01:28] <Johannen> I woulda though metal and shiny surfaces would be the first
[2:01:36] <ScreamLord> HD
[2:01:37] <%X2Eliah> except for fluids in pitchers or glasses
[2:01:37] <%paladinstarbuster> "But what's it do in swordmaster?"
[2:01:42] <Asuterisuku> PS2 supported widescreen?
[2:01:51] <+patel347> you hage to select it
[2:02:11] <+Ether101_Prime> Cut it.
[2:02:14] <Johannen> Slahs it?
[2:02:21] <+patel347> slice the all maybe?
[2:02:26] <Applecannon63> A Jade seven branch sword looks better than the goofy blade ver of the sword
[2:02:29] <%X2Eliah> cut the rope
[2:02:31] <Blank9> Does the HD version still have the main menu option to play a trailer?
[2:02:32] <%X2Eliah> ?
[2:02:44] <+patel347> slash the wall scroll thing?
[2:02:48] <%X2Eliah> yoooooooo
[2:02:56] <lotharrio> Bet this is the guy who used all the herbs.
[2:03:21] <Johannen> It did thou
[2:03:21] <+patel347> thats a door too
[2:03:22] <+patel347> i think
[2:03:22] <penitentpendant> "Drawn a picture"
[2:03:23] <Applecannon63> welp
[2:03:25] <rReizs> picture on it
[2:03:28] <%X2Eliah> background picture
[2:03:30] <crimsonsaens> It shows a picture of a bow and arrow
[2:03:34] <penitentpendant> Bow and weirdly tipped arrow
[2:03:59] <ScreamLord> Gorb
[2:04:05] <+patel347> yeah that is a door lol
[2:04:10] <JeoDood> Gorb
[2:04:19] <crimsonsaens> Go port
[2:04:25] <Johannen> Reggies saves the stream
[2:04:26] <penitentpendant> The staredown
[2:05:05] <%X2Eliah> why
[2:05:05] <Blank9> If you use the soul-suck, it has a taunt effect on enemies and makes them attack you.
[2:05:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:05:08] <Applecannon63> he'a just mocking you
[2:05:10] <+Ether101_Prime> In latter games it is.
[2:05:12] <+MugenSandan> it is in Onimusha 3
[2:05:16] <lotharrio> Magic-Issen and gun-issen are only things in later games
[2:05:39] <%X2Eliah> issen, m-issen and g-issen
[2:05:46] <penitentpendant> @lotharrio I'm vividly picturing Dante shouting "ROYAL ROCKETLAWNCHAIR"
[2:06:05] <JeoDood> Gun > magic
[2:06:13] <Applecannon63> ISSEN/ICHIGEKI/IPPATSU!
[2:06:15] <Iza_kku> gun magic tho
[2:06:32] <Asuterisuku> Did Woolie ever figure out the enemies are colour coded?
[2:08:30] <+Ether101_Prime> Are they?
[2:08:35] <Omenaire> i thought the colors were just tiers
[2:08:42] <+Selectamo> wow
[2:08:44] <+Selectamo> What a pull
[2:08:53] <%X2Eliah> imma be honest to me all enemies just look muddy brown

[2:10:00] <+Selectamo> remember the bad guy just gets turned into a screw
[2:10:00] <%DegenCat> these crows suck
[2:10:09] <Applecannon63> Screw Karasu
[2:10:14] <AnacondaVirtue> These crows are going mental
[2:10:21] <+Selectamo> and picked up by a crow, funnily enough

[2:10:48] <Ziegsy> I just saw the woolie and pat easter egg in ultrakill. Its amazing
[2:10:51] <Johannen> See Woolie you spent 3 arrows while you could have done it with 1 fire arrow * read in Pat's Monster Hunter voice
[2:10:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> the map counter is my favorite move
[2:10:57] <ScreamLord> Blorb
[2:11:15] <+patel347> did woolie complete the bloody palace?
[2:11:19] <+patel347> or did he not go back
[2:11:20] <ScreamLord> no
[2:11:22] <rReizs> would woolie use power coats on monster hunter bows
[2:11:32] <%X2Eliah> he did part of it
[2:11:54] <ink_dino> it's not what you think it is
[2:12:01] <Asuterisuku> I bet you can cut that rope.
[2:12:13] <crimsonsaens> Can he cut the rope?
[2:12:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[2:12:17] <ScreamLord> Basically you summon a ring and when you press O/B everything in it dies
[2:12:49] <Asuterisuku> Shrapnel in the face Samanosuke
[2:13:07] <Johannen> So should Nier Automata also included those QoL upgrades by default? I thought Woolie loved that kind of stuff
[2:13:13] <ink_dino> this area is not progress
[2:13:19] <pi_in_the_sci> That's the ladder
[2:13:25] <rReizs> nah thats just the floor change
[2:14:29] <Jonnyravenous> Ah the koi

[2:17:20] <brisk_dacat> Swordplay is for the novice
[2:17:34] <Johannen> Who needs sword skills when you can GUN
[2:17:36] <+Ether101_Prime> I feel Woolie's about to make a big mistake.
[2:17:51] <Asuterisuku> But you did that, Woolie.
[2:18:03] <ink_dino> YEA YEA YEA
[2:18:15] <lotharrio> Block parries are generally easier. It's why the multiplier on the souls is lesser.
[2:18:18] <Asuterisuku> Ideally you can lure one of those enemies onto the bridge before cutting it down.
[2:18:23] <+patel347> it gives you the numbers in the corner
[2:18:23] <Johannen> "I think block parry is the way to go" said known hater of royal guard Woolie
[2:18:28] <Blank9> If you soul-suck, it taunts enemies into attacking you to make it predictable for issens.
[2:18:38] <+patel347> streak broken
[2:18:57] <dukenux> ugh
[2:18:59] <+patel347> that means they are in the right place

[2:27:52] <%livlinn> heatwave sucks woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:29:14] <%dreadedcthulhu> I'm more mentally prepared for heat in the summer than having to huddle under a blanket at my desk lffnHands
[2:29:41] <DatAsuna> Yeah I think onimusha ages poorly as an awkward stepping stone between genres
[2:30:25] <%dreadedcthulhu> definitely can see shades of the RE game it was supposed to be all over the place
[2:30:25] <+Exicuren> Ehhhh, only the first one tho, Onimusha 2 and 3 and immense upgrades to the first one
[2:30:28] <Make_me_mad> Onimusha's pretty great, but weirdly I think the better controls kind of make it harder to play.
[2:30:32] <DatAsuna> whereas the games of it's time that stood more firmly in either side of survival horror/hack 'n slash hold up better
[2:30:43] <drunken_lemur> Tetris Effect!
[2:31:05] <Make_me_mad> When all you have are tank controls, using the lock on and dodging feels more intuitive and natural. Trying to 3D run away and getting knocked around for it isn't great.
[2:31:15] <DianaTheAscian> Oh wow Tetris effect
[2:31:22] <Make_me_mad> That said, yeah, 2 and 3 are dramatic improvements.
[2:31:27] <DatAsuna> and yeah the later games grasped the identity of onimusha much more distinctly
[2:31:29] <Make_me_mad> And Dawn of Dreams is solid too.
[2:31:35] <RamenRiderZ> Geez I wanna replay Guild Wars 1 but I need to do the Legendary Defender title and it's killing me OSFrog
[2:31:43] <%zanz_san> I wonder what happened to the fake composer these games had.
[2:31:44] <DatAsuna> As opposed to this game still being very experimental
[2:31:59] <Equirah> McAfee is dead, time to celebrate!

[2:46:19] <%Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! Hey Woolie, I was rewatching the old DS3 LP and I actually found the origin of the castle superbeast name in episode 3. You loved the name so much you wrote it down on the spot and said you were going to make merch with it. If only past Woolie knew...
[2:46:23] <+patel347> yeah you need to flip as they attack to do her issen
[2:46:29] <Jboogy14> This is the shrine of chaos
[2:46:49] <+patel347> according to gamefaqs guide anyways
[2:46:50] <Jonnyravenous> Back stab
[2:47:01] <+patel347> you also need to press the attack button
[2:47:07] <+patel347> when you land
[2:47:21] <Johannen> Box in front of the door
[2:48:21] <Johannen> waste
[2:48:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:49:00] <lotharrio> Companions aren't good until Onimusha 2
[2:49:01] <RamenRiderZ> Medicine Sink
[2:49:03] <rReizs> probably should just run past enemies given they get nothing for winning
[2:49:04] <+Exicuren> luckily they fixed that...... in 2
[2:49:16] <Johannen> Samanouske cant do anything without Kaede help
[2:49:26] <penitentpendant> Her sections make me think the Resident Evil mantra of "Don't Fight, just run"
[2:49:34] <%saladin1911> Samanosuke is the real damsel in distress of this game, huh
[2:49:47] <%zanz_san> run
[2:49:51] <+patel347> yeah you probably dont even need to fight them
[2:49:59] <Applecannon63> if only her blade can heal her
[2:50:10] <%paladinstarbuster> you can farm medice in the demon real though
[2:50:17] <penitentpendant> He is HER waifu
[2:50:20] <%DegenCat> mamuru him good kaede
[2:50:28] <Johannen> If only Kaede had cheez and magic so she did not need to learn the combat is the way to go
[2:50:55] <Jonnyravenous> She has a cool ninja back stab
[2:50:55] <rReizs> the doors don't have enemy locks right
[2:51:03] <penitentpendant> Eh... is it worth it to save?
[2:51:10] <JeoDood> Kaede is a stalker
[2:51:17] <lotharrio> I think starting in Onimusha 2, enemies have item drops, too.
[2:51:53] <+Exicuren> Item drops and the non Oni companions are given a talisman to absorb genma souls
[2:51:54] <%BinaryFireball> boat is upstairs
[2:51:54] <penitentpendant> "I can help!" Gets captured immediately.
[2:51:57] <%BinaryFireball> why boat upstairs
[2:52:01] <Meltgar> ONIMUSHA? GOD DAMN
[2:52:03] <Johannen> Strong independent Kaede dont need no boat like some weakling who got puncked without the Gauntlet

[2:52:09] <%paladinstarbuster> orihime has powers woolie
[2:52:13] <bufflb> has woolie said anything about playing Doom Eternal DLC?
[2:52:16] <%Lion_kun> Orihime could reject God
[2:52:22] <justcallmebobplease> Orihime got reality hax, yo. Literally 'nope, I rewrite that'.
[2:52:24] <%livlinn> oh no, not THAT type of female side character NotLikeThis
[2:52:36] <Applecannon63> KYRIE!!!!
[2:52:44] <dukenux> oh yes
[2:53:04] <%patriotrenegade> Orihime HAS powers but their shite and only good against basic bitch Hollows.
[2:53:07] <%paladinstarbuster> just run woole
[2:53:20] <%paladinstarbuster> youre supposed to run
[2:53:23] <rReizs> you get NOTHING
[2:53:33] <dukenux> i mean its a nice flip on female char having to be saved
[2:53:37] <bufflb> has woolie said anything about playing Doom Eternal DLC?
[2:53:43] <+Exicuren> It's like calssic RE wools, just kill the enemies thar block the way
[2:53:45] <%patriotrenegade> Orihime can bring back the dead, so that’s kind of OP
[2:53:52] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's a Resdient Evil game, Woolie...
[2:53:53] <rReizs> onimusha has RE blood
[2:53:53] <DatAsuna> the gameplay may have aged rough but the music is big nostalgia
[2:53:54] <dukenux> (unless she laters gets herself captured, and the roles turn)
[2:53:56] <Johannen> I dont think you are supposed to run but that's the only viable option for Woolie
[2:54:10] <Make_me_mad> Alternate idea: Just get good at the combat. Since that's impossible, you can still run past most enemies.
[2:54:12] <penitentpendant> "Men Only" says box
[2:54:14] <lotharrio> Maybe it's Samo only?
[2:54:16] <+patel347> slash?
[2:54:24] <dukenux> still looks decent too. courtesy of pre-rendered backgrounds
[2:54:34] <penitentpendant> STAAAARS
[2:54:36] <@Menitta> lmao
[2:54:39] <ink_dino> contrast & compare with Lady or Trish
[2:54:42] <%paladinstarbuster> You played re2
[2:54:45] <%Lion_kun> You played one game!
[2:54:47] <%dreadedcthulhu> this just in: woolie and pat share collective knowledge Kappa
[2:54:53] <+MugenSandan> You played DMC 1 that counts right
[2:54:58] <Prevot> of course it's an RE game, it has the zapping system after all
[2:55:00] <%Lion_kun> He played one route of RE2
[2:55:00] <%paladinstarbuster> what lessons did you learn in re 2?
[2:55:01] <@Menitta> Pat and Woolie are a singular being
[2:55:01] <%patriotrenegade> It’s just like RE5! Kappa
[2:55:03] <bufflb> @make_me_mad How dare you imply that Woolie is bad at video games????!!?
[2:55:05] <Make_me_mad> Samonosuke can cheese enemies with magic like crazy. Kaede's just got stabbing.
[2:55:08] <Applecannon63> @kaisermario At least the girls in RE actually have useful tools
[2:55:10] <DatAsuna> DMC1 does not count
[2:55:17] <dukenux> I'm pretty sure if you're next to Pat for 5 minutes, you gain RE knowledge through osmosis
[2:55:29] <+MugenSandan> @datasuna das da joke Kappa

[2:57:01] <ink_dino> dude spent all the red ink on that snazzy red cape
[2:57:08] <penitentpendant> Oof
[2:57:14] <+Exicuren> You need the broken shotgun
[2:57:17] <%DegenCat> gotta put something in the slot maybe?
[2:57:23] <lotharrio> The box is sexist.
[2:57:24] <%paladinstarbuster> Kaede is a normal person so she has to hit and run. Unlike sam who has the gauntlet
[2:57:27] <Johannen> I dont think you can get out with the arrow
[2:57:31] <mexicandetective> indiana jones
[2:57:39] <lotharrio> I think you need a fake arrow?
[2:57:48] <+Exicuren> fake arrow, yes
[2:57:53] <Make_me_mad> It's implying that you don't have the broken shotgun to put on the lever.
[2:57:55] <+patel347> yeah seems like you need a fake arrow
[2:58:00] <+patel347> maybe you can put the other one back for now
[2:58:04] <%paladinstarbuster> Kaede saved samanosuke earlier in the game with a puzzle
[2:58:09] <%livlinn> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:58:11] <+RealThiele> coxIce
[2:58:12] <DatAsuna> she's not a master of unlocking
[2:58:18] <Johannen> Big Brain Reggie
[2:58:20] <penitentpendant> @patel347 You'd think you'd be able to just put a 'normal' arrow in its place
[2:58:20] <Make_me_mad> Like this is literally just the shotgun puzzle from RE1. It's not complex.
[2:58:28] <dukenux> yep
[2:58:39] <%saladin1911> Can you just put a normal arrow on there?
[2:58:40] <+Exicuren> LUL
[2:58:42] <Meltgar> So onimusha is like RE, just with samurais, ninjas and demons?
[2:58:44] <%HeroToxiko> He doesn't have a bald spot because he is the only one who can do puzzles *stretches shirt* okaySweats
[2:58:48] <Johannen> Praise be the all knowing Reggie
[2:59:01] <crimsonsaens> Reggie is right
[2:59:02] <DianaTheAscian> Reggie is so good at games
[2:59:03] <lotharrio> @Meltgar Yeah, but it's closer to an action game
[2:59:29] <DatAsuna> reggie once again saving the channel
[2:59:29] <Applecannon63> @lotharrio basically almost a dmc game
[2:59:32] <penitentpendant> Was the other door openable in that hall?
[2:59:39] <dukenux> its a bit like DMC meets RE(which was itself an re game at one point)
[2:59:44] <+Exicuren> Yeah, the original project before being Onimusha was like Sengoku Resident evil, something like that
[2:59:46] <pi_in_the_sci> Maybe slash those boxes up there
[3:00:06] <mexicandetective> attack the boxes up the ladder
[3:00:07] <ink_dino> which means Nobunaga is japanese Wesker
[3:00:21] <CoffeeKaiju> Does woolie know he and pat are in Ultrakill
[3:00:31] <lotharrio> @Applecannon63 Yeah, especially as the series continued. Dawn of Dreams is about... 3/4s the way to a DMC. It's still slower paced and holds to its own conventions.
[3:00:36] <dukenux> wow it even has Green Herbs
[3:01:10] <DatAsuna> this OST is better than it has any business being
[3:01:16] <Johannen> Big Brain Reggie
[3:01:30] <DatAsuna> like the scene really doesn't justify music this good lol
[3:01:39] <Applecannon63> Dawn of Dream ost so good also
[3:01:50] <DianaTheAscian> @CoffeeKaiju yeah
[3:02:06] <CoffeeKaiju> @DianaTheAscian psaGoblin psaWink
[3:02:12] <Applecannon63> and the fact there some ost that sound it could be part of MvC 3
[3:02:32] <%Lion_kun> dead already
[3:02:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:02:39] <+Exicuren> Ye, the onimusha games have such fantastic OSTs
[3:03:04] <pi_in_the_sci> look to line up 2 and 3 as a priority
[3:03:25] <Applecannon63> PUZZLE GODDESS BE GENTLE
[3:04:12] <penitentpendant> @Applecannon63 She's got a cactus!
[3:04:55] <DapperCadavr> ugh this one took me so long
[3:05:13] <T_Sasquatch> But Baba
[3:05:49] <%saladin1911> I'm stumped. This one seems tough
[3:06:16] <lotharrio> "Who are you?" "I'm Baba." "NO. You are you!" "And I am Baba." "Baba doesn't matter! YOU matter!"
[3:06:28] <+faytthepally> I'm not even mad if this takes a while, I don't have any idea how to even start.
[3:06:36] <Johannen> Left-Left-Middle-Right-Right-Middle-Middle
[3:06:45] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Reggie is a hero.
[3:06:46] <+jayw888> YOU HAD IT
[3:06:56] <rReizs> need double 1 at the very least
[3:06:58] <+Exicuren> hmmmm, maybe the 1 goes un the lower row?
[3:07:02] <%Mathochism> SHADOW PUZZLLLLLLLLLES
[3:07:10] <penitentpendant> The 1 and 5, the 4 and 8 seem to be key
[3:07:12] <+Exicuren> nevermind
[3:07:19] <+Arek_1> LUL
[3:07:22] <lotharrio> Ey, a fake arrow.
[3:07:23] <%DegenCat> oh look a broken shotgun
[3:07:28] <+faytthepally> Check out the big brain on Johannen 5Head
[3:07:33] <%Lion_kun> Reggie cheated.
[3:07:39] <%saladin1911> The most satisfying way of solving puzzles.
[3:07:42] <%Lion_kun> YOU CHEATED THE GAME.
[3:07:46] <Johannen> We'v been cheating from the start, so who cares
[3:07:50] <DianaTheAscian> Reggie saving the lp
[3:07:52] <+jayw888> Woolie youre the one with the controller LUL LUL
[3:07:54] <+Exicuren> You cheated, great one, boss, we showed thst game
[3:07:56] <%DegenCat> PYRRHIC VICTORY
[3:07:58] <lotharrio> Reggie COMING OUT STRONG!
[3:07:58] <dukenux> LUL
[3:08:01] <penitentpendant> Oh no, how hollow. Look at all this time I saved, however will I not waste it
[3:08:03] <Applecannon63> Rip Run
[3:08:08] <ink_dino> victory is the greatest tribute we can pay
[3:08:12] <zanzibarian_hamster> I want boxing where everyone is juicing, make it REAL interesting
[3:08:15] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The Astros...
[3:08:16] <dukenux> everyone still knows Lance Armstrong
[3:08:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @faytthepally
[3:08:32] <DaKnightWarrior> Action Replay was really fun for goofing around.
[3:08:37] <DatAsuna> if you're rich, you must be deserving by definition, duh
[3:08:40] <+Exicuren> That chest puzzle, you it was to sell that strategy guide
[3:08:41] <zanzibarian_hamster> Just two jack hammers uppercutting away at each other
[3:08:42] <lotharrio> You gotta love the energy of the Yankees coming out to play and using the Imperial March from Star Wars as their theme. Big, "fuck you, we're gonna win, assholes" energy.
[3:08:50] <olwe123> Losers always wine about there best, Winners go home and fuck the prom queen
[3:08:50] <+faytthepally> you not only cheated the game you cheated yourself LUL
[3:08:52] <+Exicuren> you know*

[3:09:27] <%DegenCat> NAILED IT
[3:09:29] <lotharrio> It WASN'T a sexist box. Good
[3:09:30] <penitentpendant> Wait, how?
[3:09:31] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus There is a flourite up that ladder behind the boxes
[3:09:35] <dukenux> its slightly heavier or sth
[3:09:43] <crimsonsaens> They need to get the arrow out somehow
[3:09:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[3:09:45] <%Wydamn> This temple was designed by our best game designers
[3:09:46] <dukenux> or maybe not
[3:09:52] <+faytthepally> Good job stealing from us, here's a reward.
[3:10:04] <+Exicuren> Well the chest was the room's real lock
[3:10:08] <RamenRiderZ> Riddler Room
[3:10:11] <Johannen> Other ladder near the Save room
[3:10:21] <Gelphaze> Go Woolie, kill kill kill!
[3:10:29] <%paladinstarbuster> They may have wanted to use the arrow one day so theyy planned for it.
[3:10:40] <+faytthepally> The murder is the benefit Woolie.
[3:10:57] <penitentpendant> Oof. When the most optimal plan when playing the female character is to run away. Oof.
[3:11:03] <+yukichocomilk> kaede's existential experience
[3:11:09] <ink_dino> hit the boxes up there?
[3:11:11] <rReizs> too much naruto has poisoned people against ninja espionage
[3:11:14] <Johannen> Boxes are breakable
[3:11:24] <pi_in_the_sci> Slash the breakable boxes up there
[3:11:37] <Johannen> They are 3D objects)
[3:11:47] <Applecannon63> Ninjas should have military tools
[3:11:50] <+LionKagura> yea part of the background huhu
[3:11:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> I mean she's just a normal human and is doing substantially better than the other just a normal humans by being not dead
[3:12:02] <+LionKagura> Part of the background
[3:12:04] <%saladin1911> psaDown
[3:12:10] <+LionKagura> SeemsGood
[3:12:17] <Johannen> Totaly part of the background
[3:12:20] <%DegenCat> shinobi book
[3:12:45] <%paladinstarbuster> In resident evil killing all the enemies is not the goal all the time. Sometimes its about just killing the specific one to get by. thats kaede's M.O
[3:12:50] <Johannen> Kaede is holding up to the Big Cheater Samanouske with Ogre Gauntlet
[3:13:08] <%Wydamn> grasping sense from the jaws of nonsense
[3:13:32] <penitentpendant> All those healing items... gone
[3:13:40] <penitentpendant> Curse this game design
[3:13:41] <olwe123> the boxes were a different colour
[3:13:47] <+Selectamo> these graphics really hold up
[3:13:51] <Gelphaze> We got the tools, we got talent.
[3:13:52] <Iza_kku> KRILLIN NOOOOO
[3:14:01] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[3:14:03] <lotharrio> He has killed exactly one.
[3:14:04] <Johannen> Yeah, Woolie just laughing it off so he does not need to admit he is blind)
[3:14:07] <Applecannon63> DAMMIT KRILLIN NO
[3:14:19] <+MugenSandan> They were playing cards and then heard footsteps coming
[3:14:25] <Gelphaze> YEA BABY!
[3:14:25] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[3:14:25] <%livlinn> shiaLUL shiaLUL shiaLUL

[3:14:32] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but there's 4 WHOLE BUGS WOOLIE
[3:14:49] <+Exicuren> Bug Itties
[3:14:53] <DaKnightWarrior> Big brain bugs
[3:14:54] <+Selectamo> I hope this doesn't awaken something in me
[3:14:55] <+jayw888> its not much of a deal if you don't treat it like its not a game
[3:15:00] <Drunkengen> Thats a Power Rangers MOTW
[3:15:01] <+Hasmeister96> Isn't that the mosquito from One Punch Man?
[3:15:04] <brisk_dacat> Aww yeah THorexa
[3:15:05] <%livlinn> PridePog
[3:15:07] <%Wydamn> she has a human bellybutton
[3:15:07] <Johannen> She would do great on Twitch with that persona
[3:15:08] <%saladin1911> Her voice effect is already pissing me off NotLikeThis
[3:15:14] <penitentpendant> Quick, summon Plague!
[3:15:20] <+ayywood> i like the buzzing in the voice
[3:15:22] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Talking into a fan
[3:15:23] <Gelphaze> WOW HER!
[3:15:27] <lotharrio> spyKill VoteYea HahaSweat HahaShrugRight
[3:15:28] <%livlinn> PrideCute

[3:16:28] <Jonnyravenous> Wind weapon op here
[3:16:38] <%Wydamn> Whatever is the opposite of a boss fountain, she's a walking version of that
[3:16:51] <penitentpendant> @Wydamn A "Heal Sink"
[3:16:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:17:02] <dukenux> "I ate those food"~Kaede
[3:17:03] <penitentpendant> Well, 'Item Sink'
[3:17:07] <%Wydamn> @penitentpendant nailed it
[3:17:23] <Johannen> What the mag size on that matchlock? Ima need me one of those
[3:17:26] <%saladin1911> This is more like a Silent Hill style off boss fight now LUL
[3:17:36] <lotharrio> Good thing she doesn't have poison.
[3:17:49] <penitentpendant> At least the adds give healing
[3:17:55] <+Selectamo> if only you had some weapon that with an AOE
[3:17:57] <Jonnyravenous> You can tornado her too
[3:18:00] <dukenux> did he jab her own boy
[3:18:07] <dukenux> *she
[3:18:25] <rReizs> become talim
[3:18:31] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Cant switch while moving
[3:18:44] <%Lion_kun> lol woolie is not beating this tonight
[3:19:04] <penitentpendant> Oh wait, was this before picking up the Genbu book?
[3:19:13] <olwe123> need to break the boxes again
[3:19:19] <Johannen> He could be beating it tonight
[3:19:23] <Jonnyravenous> You seem in that Onimusha life
[3:19:36] <%saladin1911> Check for Genbu book! He might not have broke the boxes
[3:19:54] <lotharrio> He doesn't need the book. They've been looking up the answers to those things already.
[3:19:54] <ink_dino> i don't think Woolie is aiming to get all fluorites tho
[3:20:22] <Johannen> @ink_dino They said you dont need all of them, just some
[3:20:27] <penitentpendant> It looks like she's going to burn the Sake Boat?
[3:20:34] <%paladinstarbuster> trying to get in
[3:20:35] <ink_dino> well, yeah, they're optional
[3:21:32] <DatAsuna> springy flanger
[3:21:47] <DatAsuna> very useful on ttyd comp lol
[3:23:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AlteisenReiseZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 17 month streak! Wait 2 years? Oh jeez that's long. Glad to see you're doing better Woolz! Also, can't wait for CEO, going to an offline tourney will finally shake some rust off. Thanks for all the entertainment!
[3:23:38] <mexicandetective> the top of the thunder magic attack can hit her if she's over it
[3:24:16] <DatAsuna> welcome to survival horror bosses
[3:24:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:24:22] <+Exicuren> You only need to use the wind weapon
[3:24:23] <Jonnyravenous> Fire spell adds
[3:24:27] <+patel347> can you not block witht he gun?
[3:24:30] <lotharrio> You gotta use it.
[3:24:38] <olwe123> then stop using it
[3:24:38] <pi_in_the_sci> You have to turn the item on in your inventory
[3:24:45] <Paperware> the big SUCC
[3:24:48] <ink_dino> it's a consumable that makes a circle that drains living enemies
[3:24:58] <%saladin1911> That problem is honestly why I can't love the old RE games as much as many people do.
[3:25:21] <+jayw888> Well you used it wrong
[3:25:23] <rReizs> probably build magic for the green using the other magic?
[3:25:32] <%paladinstarbuster> you used it wrong woolie
[3:25:37] <Johannen> I checked the net for flourite info and found no use for it until NG+
[3:25:40] <+jayw888> How would you know if it's trash when it never got to work NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:25:47] <penitentpendant> @paladinstarbuster Description unclear, got sword stuck in toaster
[3:25:49] <+patel347> it fills all weapons
[3:26:23] <+patel347> i think it depends on if the current weapon is full or not maybe
[3:26:31] <%paladinstarbuster> thats a resident evil
[3:26:37] <Make_me_mad> Why not hit her when she falls, instead of standing still? Who can say.
[3:26:46] <+Exicuren> the original game did bot have quick switch
[3:27:00] <Make_me_mad> The original game only had the pause menu switching, Woolie.
[3:27:03] <+faytthepally> Exploit every advantage SeemsGood
[3:27:12] <+patel347> the infinite ads at least give you hp
[3:27:30] <+Exicuren> which is why equipping the bow or the matchlock does no yield magic souls
[3:27:54] <+patel347> I think if you suck you reset the timer on the souls a little
[3:27:54] <Jonnyravenous> Using magic gets magic orbs
[3:28:11] <lotharrio> Well it can... he hasn't been getting lucky on those drops.
[3:28:31] <+patel347> oh nice jackpot
[3:28:34] <Make_me_mad> Literally just dodge the sting and hit her. It's the easiest thing in the world.
[3:28:37] <PrideOfFiddles> Gun > Insect
[3:28:38] <+patel347> yeah its pretty bad
[3:28:41] <DianaTheAscian> thank god
[3:28:42] <%paladinstarbuster> You can in the menu
[3:28:51] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Flourite is useless turns out, so dont bother with it
[3:28:51] <%paladinstarbuster> use the menu
[3:28:56] <AthenaAegis> It's a giant murder hornet. It's supposed to be terrible Kappa
[3:28:58] <+obsilently> actually the hitbox for the fire sword actually can hit that boss
[3:29:07] <dukenux> hero exit
[3:29:10] <%HeroToxiko> Weapon switch?
[3:29:12] <dukenux> RIP
[3:29:14] <ink_dino> so how about that dark realm
[3:29:19] <%HeroToxiko> KEKW
[3:29:20] <+Exicuren> That was a Onimusha 1 only problem, completely reworked in 2 forward
[3:29:34] <penitentpendant> Sam: "YOU ATE MY FOOD!"
[3:29:49] <%HeroToxiko> no armor all axplode
[3:29:49] <lotharrio> Oh looks like she's been knocked out of the game.
[3:29:50] <+patel347> shes SAKURA
[3:29:53] <+faytthepally> Holds her with his wrist, "What happened to my herbs Kaede?!"
[3:30:09] <Paperware> At least Krillin can use Destructo Disk
[3:30:13] <rReizs> a normal hyuman in the world of deemonz
[3:30:16] <lotharrio> Look at the battle damage Sam has taken.
[3:30:16] <%Skullgod> Skullgod subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! hey
[3:30:22] <+MugenSandan> god is she even Sakura she may as well be Ten Ten
[3:30:23] <%HeroToxiko> at least she didn't get cratered lol
[3:30:42] <penitentpendant> Sam's Mamaru meter is full!
[3:30:49] <dukenux> well samurai code etc
[3:30:53] <%HeroToxiko> realistic goals are great- sam
[3:31:10] <ink_dino> now's the last moment to do dark realm if you're interested in doing it
[3:31:11] <+KrimsonTVN> Onimusha be having some HERO music, man
[3:31:18] <%DegenCat> Kaede doesn't want to go in the cart
[3:31:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:31:26] <lotharrio> Nine floors to get Medicine, it seems like.
[3:31:31] <+MugenSandan> Sam - It's like I can still hear her voice
[3:31:39] <Applecannon63> Kaede Benched
[3:31:50] <Johannen> Final Stretch of the game
[3:31:50] <+Exicuren> Wooooo, now time for Bishamon
[3:32:11] <penitentpendant> Kaede: "Oh an herb! ON NOM NOM!"
[3:32:31] <rReizs> doesn't kaede share inventory with sam
[3:32:41] <+Exicuren> That is legit good
[3:32:55] <%saladin1911> Neither did I tbh. I was thinking the same thing, Woolz
[3:33:15] <+patel347> its like a dark souls shop
[3:33:19] <+patel347> basically
[3:33:56] <+patel347> but you do consume one on a convert
[3:34:09] <Johannen> Bloody Palace and the Last Are prety much left
[3:34:14] <Johannen> Area*
[3:34:19] <rReizs> the creepo door
[3:34:30] <+patel347> you have the bow+arrow now
[3:34:45] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You dont that
[3:35:07] <Johannen> derp
[3:35:32] <penitentpendant> Dance Sam, Dance!
[3:35:44] <Johannen> Yellow Door on the map
[3:35:48] <%saladin1911> Samanosuke Mishima
[3:35:54] <romc215> Yo, Onimusha, niiice
[3:36:16] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Don't miss
[3:36:18] <Applecannon63> all he need is a Mist Step and a EWF
[3:36:27] <romc215> Is Woolie planning on playing Onimusha 2?
[3:36:29] <Jonnyravenous> So close to bishamon
[3:36:31] <penitentpendant> And it DRILLS too
[3:36:39] <+Exicuren> LUL
[3:36:42] <%DegenCat> Bumbleking Samanosuke misses the final shot
[3:36:45] <rReizs> is that a rifled bow or something

[3:39:55] <The_Grand_J> i think this game would be the raddest, if it had some goddam camera control
[3:40:29] <ink_dino> ez
[3:40:58] <Johannen> Coulda Shoulda Woulda
[3:41:08] <olwe123> I guess he was a bitch
[3:41:09] <Make_me_mad> Spamming bosses with magic remains the strongest tech.
[3:41:15] <+patel347> that door there
[3:41:22] <+patel347> only opens if you beat the bloody palace
[3:41:26] <Johannen> Who needs to learn tank controls and combat when you have magic)
[3:41:28] <penitentpendant> Praise those Demon Cartographers!
[3:41:28] <ink_dino> the very secret final endgame door
[3:41:28] <lotharrio> Demon cartography.
[3:41:34] <%saladin1911> Magic does seem completely busted in this game tbh
[3:41:34] <crimsonsaens> Who drew the map?
[3:41:35] <mexicandetective> ocarina required
[3:41:35] <+faytthepally> Demon world kiosk

[3:42:57] <mexicandetective> there's 2 medicines up ahead iirc
[3:43:20] <+patel347> pretty sure you can just walk out
[3:43:33] <rReizs> GOING IN FOR THE GOAL
[3:43:35] <ink_dino> not if he advances too much here
[3:43:36] <Johannen> Would fire sword stop them from doubling?

[3:43:46] <+LionKagura> Renaldo!

[3:46:06] <+patel347> you dont relaly need souls anymore so you dont need to fight them
[3:46:07] <Make_me_mad> Woolie abuses the shit out of that analog stick.
[3:46:12] <ink_dino> you can actually do a coup-de-grace on this guy when he goes underground, impaling his head
[3:46:17] <Johannen> Samanouske skiped leg day while Kaede didnt
[3:46:21] <Make_me_mad> I have no idea how tight you gotta be gripping your controller to accidentally press it in that much.

[3:55:49] <justcallmebobplease> And now you see why this game was hype at the time
[3:55:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> MAN THAT WOULDVE BEEN A COOL THING TO DO IN GAME
[3:55:54] <justcallmebobplease> BECAUSE LOOK

[3:56:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @drunken_lemur lmfao what xD
[3:56:30] <teefpal> Why is Nobunaga always sandbagged
[3:56:32] <ink_dino> "who?"
[3:56:38] <+LionKagura> LUL
[3:56:43] <+theGhastlyVisage> How many times will we have to kick Nobunagas ass in vidya?
[3:56:49] <Sonny_Firestorm> RIP Saito
[3:56:49] <dukenux> Nobunaga is a go to japanese villain
[3:56:54] <drunken_lemur> @abelincoln_catpuncher It was on Last Week Tonight.
[3:56:58] <crimsonsaens> Kaeda doesn't even get mentioned
[3:57:09] <teefpal> It's like as if George Washington was a demon lord
[3:57:12] <Prevot> wait is the game over
[3:57:15] <goose_coward> "where are they now?"
[3:57:18] <drunken_lemur> Or rather Condom Battlers.
[3:57:23] <Prevot> you don't even get to fight nobunaga?
[3:57:29] <lotharrio> Green Day playing in the background.
[3:57:36] <+theGhastlyVisage> @teefpal I'd fucking play that
[3:57:36] <%jinking79> pack your bags boys
[3:57:42] <teefpal> "DONT WANNA BE AN AMERICAN IDIOT!"
[3:57:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ahhhh okay lol flea right over my head
[3:57:45] <Johannen> Nobunaga will not die on this day* Assasins Creed 2 style
[3:57:46] <%HeroToxiko> I think you fight nobu in the last game
[3:57:59] <%HeroToxiko> and he was a 7 phase boss fight
[3:58:03] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[3:58:04] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:58:04] <%paladinstarbuster> Damn she died
[3:58:05] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah, japanese pop culture demonizes the shit outta Nobunaga cause he was anti-traditionalism incarnate.
[3:58:08] <thelonechris> Do not test the DMCA gods
[3:58:09] <DaKnightWarrior> Good stuff.
[3:58:09] <ink_dino> Inafune with the save
[3:58:12] <%Lion_kun> DON'T YOU
[3:58:13] <%saladin1911> Did they just kill Kaede off screen? LUL LUL
[3:58:14] <dukenux> "Stay... stay by me..."
[3:58:15] <lotharrio> Yeah, Kaede died in the epilogue.
[3:58:16] <teefpal> @teefpal The Tyranny of King Washington is pretty much this
[3:58:16] <%Lion_kun> FORGET ABOUT MEEEEEE
[3:58:18] <OldManDeckardCain> washington was already a chad, the man refused a crown and won a dance off in the same fakin day LUL
[3:58:20] <Blank9> Does this still have the trailer on the main menu after beating the game?
[3:58:24] <Make_me_mad> You guys literally just sang over the part of the ending where they said Kaede died though.
[3:58:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> WAIT SHE DIES!?
[3:58:26] <%paladinstarbuster> They just said she died
[3:58:30] <ink_dino> so what about the bloody palace
[3:58:34] <DatAsuna> it's not exactly a tour de force of storytelling
[3:58:34] <dredgyboi> They spent all the budget on CG transformation scene
[3:58:34] <+jayw888> Kaedes dead.
[3:58:35] <crimsonsaens> Doesn't he show up in the sequel?
[3:58:35] <Johannen> Everyone's favourite director Keiji Inafune
[3:58:36] <%jinking79> Finish the story in Onimusha Blade Warriors
[3:58:37] <olwe123> She dies dude
[3:58:37] <JeoDood> she dies 14 years later
[3:58:37] <DianaTheAscian> She dies off screen LUL
[3:58:39] <teefpal> They put it all on the final cutscene
[3:58:41] <+valiard> nobunaga is complex
[3:58:42] <justcallmebobplease> I bet Demon Lord Nobunaga would force Japanese companies to adopt Netcode!
[3:58:42] <pi_in_the_sci> The kill Kaede in the epilogue, but only Kaede
[3:58:44] <Paperware> You get to see the DT but don't even get to use it...
[3:58:49] <mexicandetective> I think it's explained more in blade warriors
[3:58:49] <+LionKagura> They literally just said she dies 14 years later
[3:58:53] <teefpal> Weaksauce epilogue
[3:58:53] <lotharrio> Samonosuke gets that sickass opening in Onimusha 3 because he's getting revenge for Kaede's death.
[3:58:54] <penitentpendant> "We ran out of budget" the ending
[3:58:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> Kaede died on her way back to her home planet
[3:58:58] <+LionKagura> thats so insane lol
[3:59:02] <DaKnightWarrior> That music tho
[3:59:02] <Applecannon63> Kaede got permanently benched offscreen
[3:59:09] <%zanz_san> The guy Samo fights in the 3rd game intro killed Kaede
[3:59:19] <%Lion_kun> That's all you need
[3:59:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> onimusha 2 is better
[3:59:43] <FassieFons> see you in 20 years for woolie vs RE7
[3:59:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:00:02] <%zanz_san> Onimusha 2 has the actor that inspired Spike Spiegel.
[4:00:05] <tattleworm> this game's also made a ton easier with the analog movement since it wasn't designed for it
[4:00:06] <Johannen> Woolie's excuse of bad controls)
[4:00:15] <DatAsuna> DSWool
[4:00:51] <Applecannon63> man acquired Pat's Goblins
[4:00:51] <Make_me_mad> Remember, in the original version the ONLY way to switch was via the menu.
[4:00:53] <%paladinstarbuster> In the original the ONLY way to do it was to pause
[4:00:56] <%zanz_san> It's probably why there's the Onimusha 2 hd
[4:01:05] <patt_e_cakes> I hope they remaster the sequels eventually
[4:01:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Thing is, holding R1 turns the game's movement in little swift dodges, so if the camera angle is always the same its actually much better than analog movement
[4:01:19] <mexicandetective> @patt_e_cakes same. including DoD
[4:01:22] <DatAsuna> onimusha 1 is actually aweird case where the HD QoL stuff actually makes it harder to play correctly
[4:01:25] <%livlinn> Kaneshirooo Akioooo shiaHypers PrideRise
[4:01:33] <+Exicuren> The problem is the goddamn actors' likenesses
[4:01:35] <Applecannon63> Hell even DMC1 wasn't perfect until the 3rd game
[4:01:36] <casualshinji> Analog might make navigating the world easier, but the combat functions way better with the d-pad controls.
[4:01:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It makes more sense in 2 because you always have to have R1 pressed down
[4:01:55] <Johannen> Yeah, stick is not optimal way to play this it was not desinged for it
[4:02:05] <Applecannon63> that until the ninendo the switch relaunch
[4:02:09] <%zanz_san> Fortinbras final form in Onimusha 4 is a blonde guy in a suit.
[4:02:22] <DatAsuna> the sequels absolutely do
[4:02:43] <+theGhastlyVisage> Just remembered Keiji Inafune produced this
[4:02:57] <%saladin1911> The unsung heroes of the industry: QA
[4:03:04] <dukenux> huh
[4:03:08] <DaKnightWarrior> wow really.
[4:03:11] <+TheLastStar> Whens Jubei?
[4:03:11] <%livlinn> o7
[4:03:12] <+pupil31> LUL
[4:03:12] <dukenux> ohai Shinji
[4:03:17] <%jinking79> hell of a game for a Fail Re4
[4:03:19] <+Exicuren> WOOOOO JUN TAKEUCHI
[4:03:19] <+xerotwo> LUL
[4:03:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I heartily endorse Onimusha 2, you should watch the intro
[4:03:27] <goose_coward> to be continued?
[4:03:27] <casualshinji> Did they get Kaeda's throat slits?
[4:03:32] <Blank9> Does the main menu still have the trailer for 2?
[4:03:34] <ink_dino> and now get ranked
[4:03:37] <dukenux> is that a post game shot of Sam
[4:03:37] <Johannen> @casualshinji nope
[4:03:42] <%Irridium> that's fucked up man
[4:03:44] <ink_dino> Onimusha is a Character Action
[4:03:49] <KaiserMario> That's a Castlevania ending
[4:03:51] <+Exicuren> Yep
[4:03:54] <Meltgar> B for BGOOD Kappa
[4:03:58] <JeoDood> yup
[4:04:02] <dukenux> B for Bretty good
[4:04:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The ad for 2 had Tomoyasu Hotei playing inappropriate guitar
[4:04:04] <DatAsuna> It predates DMC at least
[4:04:04] <goose_coward> does Jean Reno get an oni-trigger?
[4:04:06] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Altered Beast
[4:04:06] <Make_me_mad> Altered Beast was the first devil trigger.
[4:04:06] <drunken_lemur> Altered Beast?
[4:04:08] <JeoDood> yes
[4:04:11] <%zanz_san> Watch the Onimusha 3 intro
[4:04:11] <%paladinstarbuster> yu yu hakusho
[4:04:11] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> oh god
[4:04:11] <DianaTheAscian> B for Bingo
[4:04:12] <+Exicuren> LMAO
[4:04:12] <DatAsuna> but burst modes .etc are an old AF concept
[4:04:12] <Blank9> onimusha playtesting is where DMC's juggling combo system came from
[4:04:13] <ink_dino> Jean Reno does get a devil trigger
[4:04:14] <DaKnightWarrior> YEP
[4:04:14] <FassieFons> devilman
[4:04:16] <XeroSigmaPrime> Tekken?
[4:04:16] <lotharrio> Onimusha accidentally created DMC's juggling didn't it?
[4:04:18] <%zanz_san> watch it
[4:04:22] <goose_coward> hell yeah devil Jean
[4:04:26] <debrv> Altered Beast? The hell's that?
[4:04:29] <+megaman_sentinel> Genesis Altered Beast
[4:04:36] <dukenux> yeah it looked fun all things considered
[4:04:37] <%Irridium> Devil Kazuya?
[4:04:42] <Blank9> Aww, in the PS2 version once you beat the game, the Extras had a trailer for Onimusha 2.
[4:04:43] <DianaTheAscian> It was fun to watch
[4:04:49] <Johannen> Big Cheats
[4:04:55] <%saladin1911> Just like everything else in life, right?
[4:04:58] <casualshinji> Yeah, I think a glitch in Onimusha created the idea for juggling in DMC.
[4:04:59] <%zanz_san> Check out the Onimusha 3 introduction
[4:05:00] <dukenux> that's so many old games tho
[4:05:02] <Blank9> Fucking pointing to the stands to have a trailer for the sequel in the first game itself.
[4:05:02] <+Ornightz> The Tie in Golden Axe shared Universe Game
[4:05:02] <ink_dino> it has absolutely no kaede
[4:05:07] <goose_coward> Kaede in name only - KINO
[4:05:14] <Johannen> Onimusha 2 Eazy Mode is now Selectable
[4:05:19] <%HeroToxiko> Kaede was never seen again
[4:05:22] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Kaede 2.0 is in Onimusha 3. LUL
[4:05:23] <DianaTheAscian> She's dead Wooile
[4:05:25] <Applecannon63> @irridium doesn't count cause different genre
[4:05:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> SHE DIED
[4:05:28] <+LionKagura> woolie shes dead
[4:05:30] <tattleworm> is kotaro the kaede of 2?
[4:05:30] <+Exicuren> All of the companions in Onimusha 2 are vastly improved
[4:05:31] <ink_dino> yeah, she gets nothing
[4:05:34] <+patel347> 2 has no s links, but its got s links
[4:05:36] <penitentpendant> Under the bus Kaede goes
[4:05:42] <pi_in_the_sci> They only did it for her, it was wierd
[4:05:45] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus she died off screen
[4:05:45] <DatAsuna> Woolie even sandbagged her death lol
[4:05:48] <+patel347> no kaede but its got s links*
[4:05:49] <$Kaiser_Loar> she never come backs
[4:05:55] <+MugenSandan> The Kaede problem was resolved
[4:05:55] <lotharrio> Onimusha 3's opening is because Sam wanted revenge for Kaede.
[4:05:57] <FassieFons> kaede got lucia'd
[4:05:58] <Make_me_mad> Kaede comes back... in BLADE WARRIORS.
[4:05:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus she's gone and dead
[4:06:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Onimusha 2 has a much better combat system, but you're going to be using the D pad
[4:06:05] <drunken_lemur> When is Woolie going to Get into the Onimusha fighting game?
[4:06:08] <Make_me_mad> Blade Warriors is kind of better than it has any right to be.
[4:06:11] <DianaTheAscian> they said she never meets himagain
[4:06:16] <yeildingthought> I look forward to onimusha 3
[4:06:18] <%Grimlockfly> Completely guy
[4:06:18] <DianaTheAscian> him again*
[4:06:29] <+Kalinflip> ! Uptime
[4:06:30] <%Grimlockfly> Completely different guy
[4:06:30] <Blank9> every single other onimusha game but 1 has gun issens
[4:06:37] <+Kalinflip> !uptime
[4:06:37] <@Moobot> @Kalinflip WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 29 minutes
[4:06:38] <casualshinji> Onimusha 2 gives other playable characters a convenient soul absorb wristband.
[4:06:43] <Make_me_mad> Onimusha 3 has the best gun issen.
[4:06:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[4:06:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I really didn't like onimusha 3, they canned all the pre rendered shit and they dubbed over jean reno
[4:06:50] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Guyver manga for the first DT? Kinda?
[4:06:56] <ink_dino> i believe devil trigger auto-absorbs in 3 and 4
[4:06:59] <+pupil31> Succ like Kirby
[4:07:04] <%zanz_san> Onimusha 3 has you issen across a battlefield
[4:07:08] <lotharrio> Well by that logic, Kamen Rider is a DT.
[4:07:12] <+MugenSandan> Is Baoh a devil trigger?
[4:07:15] <mexicandetective> there is chain issens though. those are sick
[4:07:28] <Sonny_Firestorm> Is Demi-Fiend a perma DT?
[4:07:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @mexicandetective I wondered where Tsuchima got the idea from
[4:07:47] <+MugenSandan> Is Mayonnaise a Devil Trigger?
[4:07:50] <%zanz_san> Devilman is the og devil trigger
[4:07:56] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> how are you holding up Woolie?
[4:07:59] <Sonny_Firestorm> Hey Woolie
[4:08:01] <casualshinji> Yeah, Onimusha 3 ditching the prerendered backgrounds was a big turn-off for me.
[4:08:02] <Applecannon63> @lotharrio I mean Devil may Cry 3's devil trigger design is very bug like and made by a tokusatsu artist
[4:08:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you should watch the trailer for 2 because of the inappropriate tomoyasu hotei music
[4:08:06] <%zanz_san> Devilman is 1970s
[4:08:14] <%Lion_kun> AH YEAH STRIEKRS MUSIC
[4:08:27] <%zanz_san> Sparta is literally tv devilman
[4:08:36] <%zanz_san> in story
[4:08:36] <seriousink> "Kaede died on the way back to her home planet" that's just her ending. lmao
[4:08:39] <DatAsuna> and to be fair switching to sherry was way worse
[4:08:41] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Applecannon63 DMC3 devil trigger is Shin Megami Tensei. (literally, they got the char design to do it)
[4:08:44] <DatAsuna> if shorter
[4:08:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> onimusha 2 looked great with the pre rendered stuff, but 3 was hideous because it all went full 3d. looked like silent hill 3.
[4:09:03] <+MugenSandan> Yo I'd play that
[4:09:10] <Make_me_mad> Did you just suggest Silent Hill 3 looked bad? Fuck outta here.
[4:09:14] <Applecannon63> @sonny_firestorm yeah the same artist who did the tokusatsu's monster design
[4:09:15] <Johannen> Im going of armor bug like design so Guyver came to mind, tokusatsu is closer to that then Devilman even
[4:09:20] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you're just saying that cause you played the leon campaign, Claire's Ada equivalent is completely defenseless. lol
[4:09:40] <DatAsuna> Sherry is pure hide and seek
[4:09:43] <+patel347> onimusha 2 doesnt have a remaster though

[4:09:46] <ink_dino> well, if you plan on doing more, Blade Warriors is a sorta-fighting game and it would be next
[4:09:58] <DatAsuna> Liam is basically Leon s kennedy
[4:10:01] <JetpackMcQuack> Tank controls
[4:10:03] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Onimusha 2 is twice the lenght in play time
[4:10:07] <ink_dino> nothing else has a port and 3's port on steam is really bad
[4:10:12] <+MugenSandan> I mean Liam and Leon are both beautiful men they're easy to mix up
[4:10:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you look at the backgrounds of silent hill three and then compare them to Onimusha 2's backgrounds, they look like different gens
[4:10:14] <Blank9> 2 does it a LOT better for cool other playable characters.
[4:10:15] <KaiserMario> Super Onimusha Bros. is next?
[4:10:16] <lotharrio> Blade Warriors is after Onimusha 2 I think, though?
[4:10:18] <+LionKagura> @DatAsuna cmonBruh
[4:10:32] <tattleworm> oni 2's gonna be weird because it has s links and different scenes depending who you're friendly with
[4:10:40] <+pupil31> YEP Solid C
[4:10:42] <DatAsuna> There's definitely a tier list, and most resident evil characters have you jump into someone who's a super C-lister
[4:10:55] <lotharrio> Onimusha 2 has a dating game hidden inside of it.
[4:11:09] <DatAsuna> They always have someone tagging along who doesn't even warrant being in mercenaries
[4:11:40] <teefpal> Oh John MacAfee is dead
[4:11:44] <+MugenSandan> was Issen easier in 3 compared to the other games? I remember doing an Issen only run of 3 way back
[4:11:58] <Blank9> issen is a lot easier in 3, even more in Dawn of Dreams
[4:12:07] <Explodincatz> the fuck is Dark Ruin?
[4:12:18] <Applecannon63> Days of Ruin?
[4:12:23] <DatAsuna> You said liked the first two and didn't like how it went after iirc
[4:12:26] <casualshinji> Keada can throat slit man. She's cool... -ish.
[4:12:27] <%HeroToxiko> time just passed is all
[4:12:29] <theredfox930000> DMC is back
[4:12:32] <DatAsuna> fair tho
[4:12:43] <DianaTheAscian> I didn't know Advanced Wars had games past 1 and 2
[4:12:56] <Applecannon63> Adavance Wars was just Nintendo Wars
[4:12:59] <+MugenSandan> That makes sense, I don't ever remember doing Issen in 1 and 2 but 3 became a Sekiro beta
[4:13:02] <DatAsuna> yeah those were different devs.IPs but did get compared a lot
[4:13:14] <+vaderxyz1970> BATALION WARS IS THE BEST
[4:13:27] <Blank9> Days of Ruin's european release was called Dark Conflict, easy mixup
[4:13:28] <DatAsuna> I was eh on batallion wars
[4:13:35] <teefpal> I thought Days of Ruin was good?
[4:13:36] <Applecannon63> Dual Strike and Days of Ruin was more FE-esque
[4:13:38] <+vaderxyz1970> I mean steriotype wars
[4:13:50] <Blank9> Days of Ruin is great, the online was a lotta fun.
[4:13:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
