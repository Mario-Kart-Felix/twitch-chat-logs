[1:05:12] <Uncle_Christian> Magic Carp
[1:05:21] <+GalacticaPhanto> @user_naim he was playing, Reggie just stole his shoes
[1:05:26] <$eco419> Maybe he can’t move
[1:05:27] <+Grayhammatter> maybe paralyzed on the map?
[1:05:28] <ronin19xx> No movement?
[1:05:30] <randominternetsurfer> Nothing
[1:05:32] <MyNameIsRasus> He can't move in the map
[1:05:33] <Broand> Means he can't act I guess
[1:05:34] <crimsonsaens> Paralyze stops map movement
[1:05:53] <user_naim> @th3smartalec I watched the first lp, but that felt quicker with the contract and easier with the basic enemies
[1:05:53] <andre11dr> @dds333a It spends like 12 countrys i think, starts in Germany and ends in Romania
[1:06:19] <LeafarOz> Donavon baby

[1:57:58] <SpookySpaghooti> Darkling's not gonna do jack for him with his 1 attack lol
[1:58:04] <dds333a> @rekinsinn true, but they should be careful LUL
[1:58:09] <+Vigonept> yeah darkling gets wealons and shield
[1:58:17] <+terry_quest> he has no lvls lol
[1:58:26] <randominternetsurfer> @spookyspaghooti Can't Darkling still fuck them over by locking stats and shit?
[1:58:32] <+terry_quest> time to grind
[1:58:33] <andre11dr> But dosen't Darkling get IK magic?
[1:58:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> His base stats will be so low, that even with the buff and equipment it won't matter
[1:58:37] <gunstars20> Hunt the darkling
[1:58:37] <dds333a> @thedreampie aside from stat distribution doesn't seem like there are special abilities
[1:58:41] <randominternetsurfer> *Locking Town.
[1:58:46] <+Rekinsinn> seems like a different beast yeah @dds333a
[1:58:53] <%DashXero> Somebody needs to do something about Pockets.
[1:58:53] <hamahiroyuki> yeah that was a speedrun in dokapon kingdom
[1:58:55] <SpookySpaghooti> @randominternetsurfer the description for darkling in this game didnt mention those special powers, i dont know if they still exist or not
[1:58:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> 1 x 5 = 5
[1:59:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Darkling loses all gear before becoming darkling, so it should be just base stats?
[1:59:19] <thedreampie> yes
[1:59:26] <+Vigonept> ye
[1:59:27] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[1:59:30] <andre11dr> I think Minh is like  , too weak for the game to help him
[1:59:32] <dds333a> you just have to kill something afterward
[1:59:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @dds333a uh oh
[1:59:49] <andre11dr> He definitely should be lvl 2 at this point, that's insane
[1:59:51] <Ziegsy> @DashXero I say that every time I put my jeans on
[1:59:54] <hamahiroyuki> also darkling triples your stats. so he'll, in theory, be lv 6
[1:59:55] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:00:03] <viciousgrim> money on this?
[2:00:04] <%DashXero> @Ziegsy LUL

[2:00:12] <Ipsenscastle> how has Minh managed to remain lvl 2 all this time
[2:00:15] <thedreampie> Reggie's gonna get clapped
[2:00:17] <dds333a> 14 monkaS
[2:00:33] <SpookySpaghooti> @Ipsenscastle Reggie took his weapon at level 2 and he hasnt gotten a new one since
[2:00:35] <%MajorCrasher> @ipsenscastle Reggie stole his weapon at the beginning
[2:00:36] <randominternetsurfer> @ipsenscastle They crippled him by stealing his weapon.
[2:00:40] <%andrewofbob> Stole the heal
[2:00:44] <Ipsenscastle> Dire GOB got kicked out of the magician's alliance and now he's mad
[2:00:44] <dds333a> was that magic cmonBruh
[2:00:52] <+Rekinsinn> Somehow I'd still be shocked if the game can let you get into minh's situation that the Darkling mode wouldn't equally be a heavy handed boost
[2:01:01] <andre11dr> Like being lvl 2 at this point with 1 attack seems almost unwinnable
[2:01:02] <+Jiggisnipe> I think Reggie needs to upgrade his magic
[2:01:05] <Ipsenscastle> @SpookySpaghooti @randominternetsurfer @MajorCrasher that's brutal, ouch
