[0:14:10] <%NYCrownlessKing> Chun-li's giant hands

[0:14:16] <$Invlux> what art style LUL
[0:14:17] <+nocturne_reverie> the answer was Naggers
[0:14:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> the giant hands and small heads
[0:14:22] <%jiggy_snipe> and they are stiff
[0:14:22] <GenoCL> chun li with giant thighs was perfection
[0:14:24] <+ggbhtg> is the latest version of Fightcade REALLY from May 2018?
[0:14:24] <DeathByPoke7> Kens arm scar

[0:14:44] <joshua_42> Ken’s hair
[0:14:44] <%tearfuldevil> i don't like 5 much, but its better than 4
[0:14:47] <%tearfuldevil> yes
[0:14:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:14:49] <+RealPT1> sf4 inputs felt to tight to get to the good combos
[0:14:49] <@Menitta> That era was very beefcake
[0:14:53] <merk236> sf4 was the most i ever played a fighting game with friends BibleThump
[0:14:55] <JDebss> it's the design
[0:14:56] <%jiggy_snipe> lotta characters have a case of Ryu hands and feet
[0:14:56] <andrei11dr> Juri was definitely good, i know i fucking maind her
[0:14:57] <%theparisreview> SF4 is great SF players on the other hand....
[0:14:57] <%SirGO0SE> it was pretty poorly recieved at the time too
[0:14:58] <%NYCrownlessKing> it was a weird style brought to SFxT
[0:14:59] <@Menitta> KOF13 too
[0:15:01] <+firmlygraspi1> watching 4 tourneys was so comfy and exciting
[0:15:02] <%JakkChiptune> !motivated
[0:15:02] <@Moobot> 1182 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:15:05] <%NYCrownlessKing> and it didn't look good there either

[0:15:08] <%mighty_max_t> Damn, now I wanna play SF4 again, ha ha
[0:15:11] <+borat210> Spidey was thicc tho
[0:15:17] <DeathByPoke7> proximity block os
[0:15:18] <Klefth> Ken has ONLY looked good in Alpha and 3S. Change my fucking mind.
[0:15:18] <%alephalpha> crouch tech?
[0:15:19] <Shardlab> Crouch tech was so annoying
[0:15:20] <OkamiDude15> ken's hair? WACK! ken's face? WACK! the way he keeps getting nerfed? WACK!
[0:15:21] <@Solidus_113> 1-frame links
[0:15:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Some of my best combos involved one frame links/plinking, just for optimal damage
[0:15:28] <%alephalpha> not familiar with mvc2 what is crouch tech?
[0:15:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> 1-frame links suck
[0:15:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> honestly
[0:15:40] <+wmeldrum> too many hard knockdowns
[0:15:41] <+LandOfTheWay> god SFxT had such a good intro; just makes the game hurt more
[0:15:49] <%alephalpha> I-no iad link on millia is like 1 frame it's honestly not that bad
[0:15:58] <%alephalpha> annoying with delay though
[0:15:58] <+spinalwizard> Crouch tech is Hurdle 1
[0:15:59] <andrei11dr> @klefth Poket Fighter ?
[0:16:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah, playing Guy was certainly a challenge
[0:16:07] <%DaBigVitus> 1 frame is for high level tourney/pro play. those people should have advanced tech. no normies are worrying about that
[0:16:11] <Klefth> @andrei11dr Fair.
[0:16:12] <AceOne5> hi Woolie and Reggie
[0:16:12] <%alephalpha> guilty gear is anime and has hard knockdowns
[0:16:24] <+ggbhtg> You slip on a Mario Kart 64 banana in Street fighter
[0:16:29] <%SirGO0SE> in granblue hardknock down means set up city
[0:16:30] <T_Sasquatch> just add sfv characters to tekken, they perfected 2d characters already
[0:16:30] <%alephalpha> guilty gear is anime and has hard knockdowns all over the place

[0:16:51] <+ggbhtg> Delayed Based Wakeup Kappa @woolieversus
[0:16:54] <@Menitta> I know a lot of people complained it was too defensive
[0:17:04] <%wake_up_super> delayed wakeup was always the same and there were options to cover both
[0:17:10] <%JakkChiptune> Netcode was super bad
[0:17:17] <+ggbhtg> and RED FADC
[0:17:17] <andrei11dr> Red Focus was a cool final mechanic
[0:17:25] <+gustavozxd> what are you guys talking about
[0:17:28] <+MisterRaffles> @woolieversus Reggie, who was your favorite newcomer from the SF4 series?
[0:17:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @JakkMAU5plays that's just capcom in general
[0:17:31] <@Menitta> Delayed wakeup was one of the big balance changes to Ultra with Red Focus and double ultras
[0:17:32] <%NYCrownlessKing> Rolento was dumb @WoolieVersus
[0:17:33] <%NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[0:17:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> loool

[0:17:43] <%jiggy_snipe> but that was alot of games back then
[0:17:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> why couldn't makoto be better
[0:17:46] <%DaBigVitus> talking about fighting games on a fighting stream? ewwwww
[0:17:48] <%alephalpha> juri was fun back then
[0:17:49] <%KongolComet> LOVE Rolento
[0:17:50] <Shardlab> Sagat was King in 1.0
[0:17:51] <DaKnightWarrior> I need to go back and play USF4
[0:17:53] <lem______> rolento is an honest boy
[0:17:54] <emeraldskrull> sagat is the zabuza of streetfighter
[0:17:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, why couldn't makoto be 3rd strike makoto

[0:18:09] <@Menitta> USF4 was one of the games that got me fully into fighters.
[0:18:15] <%NYCrownlessKing> yeah that game revived the local scene anyway lol
[0:18:15] <@Menitta> It didn't make me good though.
[0:18:16] <genmypoweralready> It couldn't be helped

[0:18:40] <%Zayasu> yeah usf4 also got me into fighting games

[0:33:17] <Torgue_1> And in the comics
[0:33:17] <arikk42> Rotten TOmatoes, Heres my Sundays best !
[0:33:19] <TheFramedWarlock> Why would they put in War Machine and not Iron Man ?
[0:33:27] <@Menitta> Big fan of the Mugen character Ghetto War Machine
[0:33:27] <%DaBigVitus> bet they workshopped the name black machine
[0:33:29] <rasamune> Why ISN'T it Iron Man, anyway?
[0:33:31] <%Solidnick18> gambitooo
[0:33:32] <%jiggy_snipe> License issue
[0:33:34] <DDDorsett> Because its Warmachine
[0:33:35] <+gustavozxd> gambit looks so fucking cool
[0:33:36] <DDDorsett> 4Head
[0:33:38] <GenoCL> @TheFramedWarlock I think Acclaim or Midway had Iron Man's license at the time
[0:33:40] <%Solidnick18> mr remy
[0:33:41] <popcultureaficionado> you don't know anything about warmaachine Reggie?
[0:33:42] <huskarl_zap> Why not the punisher?
[0:33:43] <thesickestzak> Gambit and Jin
[0:33:50] <anuchallengertwitch> I do like how Infinite finally added X. I just wish he was in a more high octane fighting game
[0:33:52] <StarkMaximum> I can't say for sure but license issue feels right, and I would also guess War Machine may have been relevant to a current story when this game came out
[0:33:52] <arikk42> JIN SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:33:54] <zk_nails> there was an episode of the Iron man cartoon from the 90s about how War Machine couldn't swim... I'm not even joking
[0:33:55] <thesickestzak> Yeyeyeye
[0:33:56] <%jiggy_snipe> missles are cooler than lasers anyway
[0:33:57] <huskarl_zap> Why not daredevil?
[0:33:59] <sirthomas2step> Rhodes has to be a lil rich
[0:34:00] <%wjones0415> @theframedwarlock they didn't have the license at the time most likely

[0:44:59] <TheFramedWarlock> It's a sick ass game don't get me wrong, but it's not as technical as normal fighting games
[0:45:09] <andrei11dr> No ,Colossus and psylock are definitely the best assists
[0:45:11] <%hellfragger> still the best marvel game
[0:45:11] <TheGershon> Good timing with that great SugarPunch video that came out yesterday, had a clip of the boys playing Lethal League at the end

[0:49:16] <300coolfactsaboutbears> @theframedwarlock It's not as technical as traditional fighters, but it's unmistakably a fighting game. Most youtube coverage doesn't go into the deeper mechanics and the game is played VERY differently competitively.

[1:02:44] <DDDorsett> LETS GO CRAZY
[1:02:48] <Dementedpenguin> I remember walking into an arcade in 98 and seeing MvC, Metal Slug 2, Daytona USA, and Virtual On occupying the same space PogChamp
[1:02:50] <TheFramedWarlock> Hell yeah it's Mahvel
[1:03:07] <WakeUpThrow> Two reps from Ghosts and Goblins in Infinite was baffling
[1:03:12] <%SomersaultJustice> do that move with morrigan, you know, THAT one
[1:03:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo besteban, can you actually play gold warmachine?
[1:03:17] <+SuichiTanaka> Colossus has multihits, and mad corner carry
[1:03:22] <DDDorsett> No Gold Warmachine plz
[1:03:25] <DDDorsett> :)
[1:03:32] <Ospreynaitor> Kinda sad there was never really a fighting game community where i lived, would've loved to get into them when i was younger
[1:03:36] <andrei11dr> Luckily for us, Morigan is pretty trash in this, THANK GOD

[1:06:45] <@Menitta> I feel like Marvel games are some of the hardest to get into.
[1:06:45] <+zed11111111> Is Ourobouros as oppressive in this game as it is in UMvC3?
[1:06:59] <@Menitta> Which is ironic considering it's such a popular brand.
[1:07:08] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[1:07:19] <%floralkami> damn, none of those hits are overheards, huh
[1:07:22] <andrei11dr> @zed11111111 It's more oppressive, it's a level fucking 1

[1:22:24] <Joestar1890> @TheFramedWarlock I remember from a few streams back, Woolie and Little V said that there was a law in Canada that didn't allow "War" to be used children's products. So I wonder if the name "War Machine" was changed to suit this.

[1:23:59] <%KirbonicAcid> Capcom has this interconnected universe and they're NOT USING IT
[1:24:01] <+GalacticaPhanto> Hiryu is technically Zeku's family maybe?

[1:44:54] <%ChoculaUltra> depends on what ya play tbh!
[1:44:56] <MistahMrMatt> always wanted one myself
[1:45:02] <%LCLSmoothie> @theycallmenerf depends how invested you are into fighting games
[1:45:03] <GenoCL> they're good
[1:45:04] <huskarl_zap> if you play everyday
[1:45:09] <stormydaysz> not really worth it unless you really want one
[1:45:11] <%floralkami> OH YEAH and the first Heavy Rain LP too
[1:45:18] <Applecannon63> DOUBLE BUSTER
[1:45:23] <therare_panda> the tap sounds on the fighting pad are Kreygasm

[1:45:40] <arkv01> yo pangolins love THUG
[1:45:41] <%ChoculaUltra> it's a preference. Don't forget dudes win EVO with controllers regularly lol
[1:46:01] <huskarl_zap> If you use a keyboard then yes
[1:46:11] <andrei11dr> @floralkami I would actually recommend the Woolie version over the first Heavy Rain LP LUL
[1:46:15] <%ChoculaUltra> hell there's this one dude in the Tekken community that's been playing with an OG PS1 controller to this DAY.
[1:46:17] <Kei_Ar_> ive never seen sonicfox hold a stick before

[1:46:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:46:26] <%LCLSmoothie> @theycallmenerf i suggest playing more FGs and if you feel deeply invested, get one
[1:46:29] <%floralkami> @theycallmenerf if you want a good one that's not booty buttcheeks on the price, get the Hori Fightpad
[1:46:43] <%LCLSmoothie> just know it’s just a preference and won’t make you magically better
[1:46:49] <stormydaysz> unless you mean the hori fighting commander pad , then thats an upgrade over an xbox pad but not a dualshock

[1:54:09] <anuchallengertwitch> I'd love for Woolie to do a playthrough of the Zero series. They're basically 2D action games. I just hope he doesn't quit after the first game because it's comparatively the worst out of the four games.
[1:54:09] <BloodiaMK2> This one's without a doubt my favorite MvC game
[1:54:27] <%FboyDaKing> Get them w’s @thebesteban
[1:54:35] <TheGershon> @anuchallengertwitch He's played Z1, talked about it on the podcast
[1:54:40] <%floralkami> @anuchallengertwitch I always here that about 3, tho
[1:54:48] <%ChoculaUltra> @andrei11dr there's this gacha game for mobile called KoF Allstars and they're doing an event with WWE wrestlers like The Rock, John Cena, and The Undertaker. It's wild.

[1:55:14] <+aishman> Same Solid.
[1:55:15] <@Solidus_113> Gonna have to teach Reggie the game first

[1:57:02] <TheGershon> @anuchallengertwitch CSB, maybe a month ago or so. He mostly talked about how he forgot how unforgiving the retry and cyber elf systems were iirc
[1:57:05] <habernack> oh mon dieu vous etes terribles
[1:57:15] <%ChoculaUltra> oh yeah - Lethal League Blaze is on sale at GreenManGaming for $18

[1:58:03] <Shade075> Wait was that an evil Ryu transformation mid game???
[1:58:11] <lotharrio> @Froyuken Played his side scroller as a kid and was confused immensely by it.
[1:58:15] <arikk42> MVC 1 Best anime of 1998
[1:58:23] <BloodiaMK2> @Shade075 Ryu can use Ken or Akuma's moveset in this game
[1:58:24] <%floralkami> @300coolfactsaboutbears as quoted by She-Hulk "you have a tight little tushy there"

[2:00:40] <300coolfactsaboutbears> The MMZero elves almost turned me off of the games. Thankfully not because they are REALLY good games. Especially the bossfights and movement.
[2:00:56] <+ghostfaceninja_> doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider doodstrider

[2:01:18] <oAznoUta> this sound chip was the best games music and no one can convince me otherwise
[2:01:29] <TheGershon> If I could just get those blood restoration romhacks on the Zero collection on DS instead of just GBA I'd be in business
[2:01:31] <NephiStreams> wow nostalgic
[2:01:35] <BardockROCKS> @WoolieVersus more mvc1 in the future PogChamp
[2:01:43] <%jiggy_snipe> yep this era of music was the best
[2:01:46] <anuchallengertwitch> @300coolfactsaboutbears It bugs me because it like,"Hey do you see this cool new mechanic that lets you do interesting stuff in this game? Don't use it or we'll punish you"
[2:01:52] <bazz_tv> no cheeda Gief colors in mvc1?
[2:01:53] <%ChoculaUltra> @Froyuken part of me wants to say it was hardware limitations at the time, could be wrong. I think MvC2 is a CPS2 game whereas this was CPS1?
[2:01:56] <%floralkami> @optimasmaximas night night, hitta
[2:01:57] <+ghostfaceninja_> Ive always loved Strider even when he was trash tier
[2:02:02] <arkv01> not bad not bad bestaban workin it
[2:02:10] <TheGershon> MvC2 was on Naomi
[2:02:12] <Froyuken> MvC2 was Naomi, @ChoculaUltra
[2:02:16] <%ChoculaUltra> ah kk
[2:02:27] <TheGershon> And this is CPS2

[2:02:44] <Froyuken> CPS1 was pre-SFII era Capcom.
[2:02:52] <%optimasmaximas> @floralkami oh is that what zangief says? thought it was just some hurrah
[2:03:00] <darwood_> Esteban a killer
[2:03:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> run it back
[2:03:07] <%ChoculaUltra> ah gotcha gotcha
[2:03:09] <TheGershon> Nah CPS1 had most of the pre-super SF2
[2:03:11] <TheGershon> iirc
[2:03:14] <%floralkami> @optimasmaximas lol no, the sound clip of Wolverine jumping
[2:03:18] <huskarl_zap> Blackface wolverine
[2:03:27] <bazz_tv> most classic Capcom fighters are cps2

[2:03:40] <huskarl_zap> Blackface Safespace
[2:03:44] <%LCLSmoothie> wolverine had a costume that was 1/4 black face
[2:03:46] <300coolfactsaboutbears> @anuchallengertwitch Yeah, it felt super discouraging. Really exited for 30XX to release because the loadout system will be more refined.
[2:03:53] <huskarl_zap> Blackface Anakin
[2:03:53] <bazz_tv> only 3 game are cps3 and the rest is naomi
[2:03:53] <%floralkami> OOOOH
[2:04:17] <TheGershon> CPS3 had the best game, Warzard Kappa
[2:04:19] <Froyuken> @bazz_tv SFIII, Jojo, and Warzard?
[2:04:27] <bazz_tv> yep
[2:04:31] <andrei11dr> @anuchallengertwitch Play Undernight Kappa
[2:04:36] <%ChoculaUltra> completely forgot it went CPS2 to Naomi since there was only like 5 games on CPS3 right? Like the first SF3 and JoJo iirc?
[2:04:43] <anuchallengertwitch> @300coolfactsaboutbears I just want an X9 and ZX3; I really want those cliffhangers resolved.
[2:04:49] <BardockROCKS> lol
[2:04:51] <%optimasmaximas> is he gonna do it sbfpSetIn

[2:06:12] <bazz_tv> but that is counting 3 versions SFIII and 2 jojos
[2:06:14] <Froyuken> Like how all the Capcom characters got their own logos in the character select screen.
[2:06:25] <%doughvatkyn> Good read
[2:06:26] <TheGershon> Despite Jojo having some seriously cut back graphics and animations on PS1 I'm pretty sure it sold well, a lot of people still think of Jojo as a PS1 game

[2:07:27] <bazz_tv> ps1 jojo had a lot of spritework cut due ps1 not being up to the task, but they compensated with the super story mode
[2:07:43] <andrei11dr> Wasn't there some rumors about Arcsis making a Jojo game? What happened with that?

[2:21:01] <+TomasoChocotaco> tell reggie about the meter at the bottom

[2:21:09] <%LCLSmoothie> i’m gonna cop this on ps4 tonight
[2:21:10] <+ForteBlade> Down-airs are great for hitting fast balls
[2:21:15] <Vendigear> I'm so sad that he's not looking at chat/twitter
[2:21:20] <Cactos_> PC is the most active by far though for online play
[2:21:23] <%Jack8274> The cross up

[2:21:36] <%psidefx> Reggie knows the secret to the tech'
[2:21:36] <nothuzad> im pretty sure woolie doesnt know about the meter at the bottom either (or doesnt remember)
[2:21:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Keep pressing all random to unlock a skin
[2:21:41] <Viewtiful_Rose> Reggie your ability is that you can angle the ball in any direction with raptor
[2:21:42] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Hit bunt while hitting the ball to parry. there's a lot of other shit in the 2nd tutorial. Strongly recommend you do it.
[2:21:43] <Saltmeisterr> he did one song woolie

[2:22:10] <spardanwarrior> Gotta give us those funky beats!
[2:22:22] <+Hylian726> the sound effects are fine, just the music a little bit louder
[2:22:38] <BalloniWright> Gengar
[2:22:42] <+Hylian726> it sounds like the music slider in game might be lowered
[2:22:43] <%floralkami> OOOO
[2:22:51] <+AWr00tBear> Look at the boombox (bottom center) for when the ball will be released when the ball is going really fast.
[2:22:58] <Saltmeisterr> i wonder how many people from the Team Reptile discord are here?
[2:23:12] <%south_pyne> Probably not much
[2:23:27] <300coolfactsaboutbears> I'm there but I don't post.
[2:23:30] <%floralkami> I wanna see this get hyper again
[2:23:36] <TheGershon> @woolieversus btw you gave Reggie fake news, hideki naganuma only did 1 track for this game

[2:24:06] <Dova573> When you hit that speed, KA KA KA KA Intesifies
[2:24:08] <TheFramedWarlock> I wanna see the apocalypse ball
[2:24:12] <Vendigear> competitive level LLB is the hypest thing
[2:24:17] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Eithee way I hope they do the 2nd tutorial because that's where half the other mechanics are.
[2:24:19] <fangovafang> u really do
[2:24:30] <@Solidus_113> go to the Subway level and you should hear his track
[2:24:38] <+TomasoChocotaco> the meter at the bottom tells you when the ball is released from the hit.
[2:24:43] <Vendigear> get funky
[2:24:45] <Saltmeisterr> i feel like woolie is gonna get bodied only
[2:24:47] <%floralkami> turn that music UP

[2:30:24] <Applecannon63> why the hell isn't Lethal Leage in Evo as a exhibiton?
[2:30:25] <+croxeye> damn that sucks to hear jack :(
[2:30:28] <300coolfactsaboutbears> The rollback is serviceable.
[2:30:28] <TheGershon> Damn, bad rollback exists?
[2:30:38] <+croxeye> street fighter V says yes
[2:30:40] <Applecannon63> awww
[2:30:44] <sleepy_pixels> Which console is this?
[2:30:45] <%Jack8274> 12/6 baseball
[2:30:48] <nothuzad> TheGershon SFV has bad rollback for example
[2:30:54] <%floralkami> @thegershon you seen SFV?
[2:30:57] <Viewtiful_Rose> They’re playing on pc I think
[2:31:11] <300coolfactsaboutbears> It won't save a bad connection like Skullgirls, but it works fine in normal conditions.
[2:31:18] <TheFramedWarlock> What does parrying actually do ?
[2:31:20] <%Jack8274> I'm still blown away how Woolie hit these on REACTION!
[2:31:26] <TheGershon> Ah yeah woolz did mention that on the podcast
[2:31:39] <+xerotwo> LUL
[2:31:41] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:31:41] <TheGershon> Can you blame me for not ever playing sfv online
[2:31:42] <whitemage4life> Congrats Woolie on beating Pat in viewers
[2:31:45] <%Solidnick18> curve ball
[2:31:48] <%LCLSmoothie> after hearing the “red bars go home” convo on the podcast, i got a lan cable right after it
[2:31:56] <fangovafang> this candyman dude is freaky lol
[2:31:58] <%floralkami> @theframedwarlock if I'm seeing right, it let's you grab the ball and throw it, outsider of using a special move
[2:32:02] <%DocChutney> the few instances of bad rollback convinced lots of people that rollback is worse then delay
[2:32:02] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus u can unlock characters in showcase, 1000 for each
[2:32:04] <%floralkami> *instead of
[2:32:06] <%Vorga1339> @TheFramedWarlock if the opponent tries to hit your ball as soon as it starts moving they get stunned and then hit. The point of parrying is to make people have to back up and react to the ball once it starts moving instead of just sitting in your face and instahitting it.
[2:32:29] <TheFramedWarlock> Ah I see
[2:32:31] <@Solidus_113> you don't have the dunds for characters

[2:33:48] <usurper_sos> OH YEAAAHHH
[2:33:52] <BloodiaMK2> Imagine playing this at Farmer's Market Kappa
[2:33:55] <%barkon345> waht is the difference between each of the characters when they all just have to hit a ball?
[2:33:57] <Vendigear> switch has a dang wallrun
[2:33:58] <arikk42> nighty night to everyone
[2:34:01] <Viewtiful_Rose> Oh wow i actually never noticed that and u play this game quite a bit
[2:34:04] <@Solidus_113> you want the speed to break 1000
[2:34:05] <+SeekoBlastar> Hit their body after they die for BM
[2:34:06] <Vendigear> candyman has highjump
[2:34:08] <Viewtiful_Rose> *i
[2:34:14] <%south_pyne> Sonata has a triple jump as well
[2:34:15] <%LCLSmoothie> @vendigear night!
[2:34:15] <theamberfang> barkon345 they hit the ball at different angles and they have different special abilities
[2:34:15] <Vendigear> jet has hover
[2:34:18] <%Solidnick18> yeah for people can break the speed barrier
[2:34:19] <Saltmeisterr> i actually don't know how switch works, doesn't he have 3 specials?
[2:34:20] <%floralkami> @barkon345 every character has a different special that gives the ball properties
[2:34:22] <%DocChutney> i once hit max speed in a real match in lethal league 1
[2:34:22] <%Solidnick18> four
[2:34:22] <%psidefx> SWITCH = Ro-Boy
[2:34:26] <%Jack8274> She's pretty thick...
[2:34:28] <+croxeye> is there crossplay for this game?
[2:34:29] <%jiggy_snipe> peopel can do goofy things with the ball to screw with timing
[2:34:34] <Saltmeisterr> no crossplay
[2:34:36] <stormhawk9891> Skate ride on the walls and ceiling
[2:34:38] <%south_pyne> @croxeye no there isn't
[2:34:40] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[2:34:45] <+croxeye> damn that sucks :(
[2:34:47] <stormhawk9891> Switch I mean
[2:34:51] <%Solidnick18> SourPls SourPls
[2:34:55] <+serpenttucker> Apart from having different special, they can hit the ball at different angles, and each character handles jumping and walls differently. Some characters get a double jump, a crouch jump, and can even hang on the sides of the stage.
[2:34:57] <+NekoNinja13> have the learn about the grab yet?
[2:35:00] <%Solidnick18> Funky fresh beats
[2:35:01] <%BackwardCap> One thing this game still fails at is actually telling/showing you what each character can do.
[2:35:03] <BloodiaMK2> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:35:05] <kd0g_> pepeJAM
[2:35:08] <+COMB711> @WoolieVersus there's a dice color unlock for mashing though his colors really fast
[2:35:10] <HoldBtoRun> SourPls
[2:35:13] <%south_pyne> @BackwardCap theres a training mode for that
[2:35:14] <Saltmeisterr> yeah but like he has 3 different switch flips right?
[2:35:24] <%BackwardCap> Training mode doesn't have a move list
[2:35:27] <@Solidus_113> not coins
[2:35:31] <%Jack8274> What?
[2:35:31] <@Solidus_113> just mash colour change
[2:35:32] <Vendigear> HMMMMM
[2:35:34] <imadethis_> you can wake up bunt, throw, or neutral
[2:35:36] <300coolfactsaboutbears> 3 different ways to do the move. 2 angles for it.
[2:35:37] <NekoZen> what
[2:35:37] <%Jack8274> Did you stop reading lol
[2:35:37] <%south_pyne> No you cycle through the colors with dice
[2:35:39] <Rhinoprotoss> Woolie can't read
[2:35:42] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus MASH through his colors
[2:35:48] <+SeekoBlastar> swat their body away after they turn to stone
[2:35:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @woolieversus Just mash through his colors
[2:35:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:36:03] <@Solidus_113> It's his best one too
[2:36:12] <Saltmeisterr> LMAO REALLY
[2:36:19] <Saltmeisterr> thats a dumb unlock
[2:36:22] <Saltmeisterr> i just got it
[2:36:24] <%Jack8274> Reggie is feeling the furry power rising
[2:36:29] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Raptor's super is the dirtiest thing in the game.
[2:36:29] <+COMB711> @Solidus_113 I like the white version a bit more I think
[2:36:32] <Victory_Boss> @WoolieVersus You can hit people's dead bodies when they get knocked out
[2:36:37] <Vendigear> so who's the main poster character for Reggie to main?
[2:36:46] <Saltmeisterr> Dice is pretty crazy too
[2:36:46] <@Solidus_113> Dice
[2:36:47] <%south_pyne> Definitely doombox
[2:36:51] <%psidefx> Latch
[2:36:54] <%Vorga1339> @woolieversus if you cycle colors 36 times on Dice it unlocks an outfit to be specific
[2:36:55] <%DocChutney> latch is *technically* the grappler
[2:37:03] <+Struggleful> LUL
[2:37:09] <TheFramedWarlock> Why is raptor's super dirty ?
[2:37:13] <%floralkami> @victory_boss yeah, but it's only really cool during team play
[2:37:13] <%DocChutney> DocChutney subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:37:21] <BalloniWright> damn
[2:37:24] <Saltmeisterr> but yeah raptor's special is an insane mixup
[2:37:25] <%floralkami> or 3-4 players
[2:37:38] <300coolfactsaboutbears> I think Reggie would like dice because he is shorthop fastfall downair man.
[2:37:40] <+COMB711> Grid's super is so rad
[2:38:06] <Saltmeisterr> Grid has 2 supers too
[2:38:10] <@Solidus_113> ez prey
[2:38:16] <Vendigear> doombox is the boss character that should be banned from tournaments
[2:38:16] <%DocChutney> @woolieversus you can tl when the ball will come out based o when the bars on the boombox fills
[2:38:37] <+Taglog7> PogChamp
[2:38:39] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:38:39] <Saltmeisterr> welp now i have the good Dice skin
[2:38:41] <@Solidus_113> you can adjust the ball speeds on character select
[2:38:46] <BalloniWright> try harder 4Head
[2:38:53] <+NekoNinja13> I cant wait for them to learn about parries
[2:38:55] <%LCLSmoothie> put that on my gravestone
[2:39:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Are items turned off?
[2:39:03] <huskarl_zap> That gator got hit in the reptile nutz
[2:39:08] <Ner234> This game at max speed is the hypest shit
[2:39:09] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Raptor's super lets him unleash the ball at double speed at any angle, at any timing he wants and he can bunt out of it.
[2:39:14] <%Solidnick18> damn it reggie
[2:39:15] <300coolfactsaboutbears> That's the tldr🤑
[2:39:17] <usurper_sos> or not
[2:39:21] <%BackwardCap> Gonna be close Kappa
[2:39:23] <%floralkami> damn man, I'd love to get this game, but I don't even have time for the games I do have!

[2:40:42] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL

[2:40:45] <huskarl_zap> what happened to 1 hit kill
[2:40:47] <EDFscout> C'mon more taunts!
[2:40:55] <+croxeye> TURN THE ROOM NEGATIVE
[2:40:56] <%floralkami> @theframedwarlock it is, but this ain't it
[2:41:01] <%Exiliator> is Headbangeren or whatever the song was called in the game?
[2:41:05] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> Dust looks like if Zato and Faust had a kid
[2:41:06] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[2:41:13] <@Solidus_113> All the OG LL songs are in
[2:41:18] <Saltmeisterr> i think all the songs from LL is in
[2:41:21] <%LCLSmoothie> this is nice ass tunes, gonna add this to the driving playlist
[2:41:25] <%Exiliator> Neat
[2:41:26] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Now we have health bars so you can only be one shot at high speeds.
[2:41:30] <Saltmeisterr> although how do u unlock them?
[2:41:32] <Guyshane> Dust's voice sounds super familiar

[2:42:01] <CalderGaming> Lethal League Lazy
[2:42:03] <%Vorga1339> if you mash up wakeup you auto take the ball if it is near you, if the ball is not near you you get stuck in a taunt
[2:42:05] <Vendigear> @huskarl_zap only because we arent getting high speeds
[2:42:06] <%floralkami> just under "Blaze"
[2:42:08] <BalloniWright> sick

[2:42:26] <@Solidus_113> mash through Dice's colours 36 times
[2:42:29] <300coolfactsaboutbears> You can grab the ball out of the bubble.
[2:42:33] <%GenesisKnight> mash through Dice's colors they're saying
[2:42:34] <Saltmeisterr> just mash through dice's color
[2:42:36] <+COMB711> pick dice in here and mash color swap
[2:42:40] <theamberfang> it's to unlock one color
[2:42:41] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Just mash through Dice’s colors

[2:44:16] <%Vorga1339> My favorite thing about Dice is they put him in the game after watching Ping Pong the Animation, one of the most slept on sports anime of all time imo
[2:44:28] <Saltmeisterr> they are not there solidus
[2:44:35] <%south_pyne> @Vendigear because of its long length, it makes certain angles so much harder to combo with

[2:57:10] <%DensityD> sounded like double parry
[2:57:23] <DMatts142> Toxic's special places graffiti on the map. If the ball ever touches the graffiti, it bounces off of it & becomes her ball.
[2:57:31] <%floralkami> @spacecatstreams yeah, get in quick match to get lucky
[2:57:33] <%JakkChiptune> online standard is 4 stocks, OG Lethal was 5 stocks

[2:58:38] <NeerNH> lol south
[2:58:40] <+ArcanumArcanum> to counter the parry you use the throw
[2:58:41] <%south_pyne> Sup neer
[2:58:45] <NeerNH> eyo
[2:58:46] <Daxalog> You press Bunt during the hit pause
[2:59:00] <DMatts142> if you press bunt while spiking a ball you parry. While theyre parrying, you can only grab the ball
[2:59:11] <DMatts142> if you swing you get parried & die
[2:59:12] <DSD24> I love the music in this game
[2:59:15] <Saltmeisterr> its hard to grab a parry tho
[2:59:31] <300coolfactsaboutbears> He naked.
[2:59:32] <Daxalog> So high level players in this are real killers
[2:59:33] <huskarl_zap> banned pook

[3:00:06] <%ChoculaUltra> how many brothers/close friends did you have to kill to get eyes to play this game at high level
[3:00:21] <Saltmeisterr> its not that hard actually
[3:00:32] <%DensityD> 500 PogChamp
[3:00:33] <DMatts142> FYI, bunting the ball resets the recoil on spiking it
[3:00:33] <NeerNH> high level llb is somethin

[3:00:55] <JaseAdrift> THE TECH
[3:00:56] <%0rond> yeah at high speed it's more about timing the hit to the boombox and less following the ball
[3:00:58] <Saltmeisterr> on switch tho
[3:01:06] <%DensityD> gg
[3:01:07] <+ArcanumArcanum> that's a killer right there

[3:04:55] <%south_pyne> https://challonge.com/yng2dcy
[3:04:56] <Kenny_Riot> @DSD24 There's a white version of it too, but to get it, you need to get all of Dice's other colors. Since next to no one plays online, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
[3:04:59] <NeerNH> did you ping events?
[3:05:00] <keiji_maede> STAND DOWN NOW!!
[3:05:03] <DMatts142> Nitro has AMAZING alt pallets but he's weird to play
[3:05:04] <NeerNH> I didn't see that
[3:05:08] <%ChoculaUltra> the lack of a true lobby system feels quite...glaring.
[3:05:09] <%south_pyne> I didn't
[3:05:10] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Supercop.
[3:05:10] <DSD24> @Kenny_Riot That's lame
[3:05:12] <%south_pyne> Should've
[3:05:17] <Saltmeisterr> shoutouts to minecraftsteve

[3:05:30] <DSD24> Latch with the eat tech
[3:05:33] <%SirGO0SE> FeelsGoodMan
[3:05:35] <NeerNH> just make sure you format it correctly
[3:05:37] <AppleBerryKitty> not a teabag its more like respect
[3:05:41] <Kenny_Riot> @DSD24 Yeah, because the noise colors are all based on how often you play multiplayer and shit
[3:05:53] <DMatts142> @WoolieVersus When you use Nitro's special, you can either hold forward or backwards to either pull yourself to the ball OR pull the ball back to you
[3:06:03] <%ChoculaUltra> I find Candyman's "teabag" quite endearing for some reason
[3:06:04] <huskarl_zap> tea bag all you want damn triple kill
[3:06:20] <%south_pyne> Do some ranked
[3:06:21] <%DensityD> "Nitro...out"
[3:06:36] <NeerNH> ranked isn't going to be too friendly south
[3:06:38] <DSD24> Candyman is very endearing
[3:06:40] <%Vorga1339> If Street Fighter is fighan chess, LLB is fightan geometry
[3:06:45] <%BurningSaph> candyman teabag looks like he's dancing more than teabagging
[3:06:46] <DMatts142> Raptor is the Ryu of this game. He's so good.

[3:07:59] <Kenny_Riot> That red version of Toxic is a pain in the ass to unlock
[3:08:02] <Vendigear> powerups?
[3:08:09] <Kenny_Riot> Gotta win with the clock ending in 11 or 33
[3:08:12] <@Solidus_113> The game is $15 on Fanatical
[3:08:20] <NeerNH> it's quick match so powerups are enabled
[3:08:30] <%DensityD> he's just a boy
[3:08:32] <%ChoculaUltra> are any of dem alternate skins on sale tho
[3:08:35] <NeerNH> on ranked it the settings would be 5 stocks no powerups
[3:08:40] <Saltmeisterr> @Kenny_Riot really, i unlocked it on accident
[3:08:43] <arkv01> some WIPEOUTS

[3:10:26] <NeerNH> she can also manually set a spray by latching onto the wall and pressing swing when special is charged
[3:10:34] <Vendigear> what is ashes special?
[3:10:39] <Kenny_Riot> @Saltmeisterr Yeah, that's how you did it. You won a match with the timer ending in 11 or 33

[3:13:52] <%Exiliator> Do they have the mode were you just have to hit and dodge the ball, but it's never friendly, like in the old game?

[3:16:52] <sackerkappa> At least there aren't bat flips here or else shit would hit the fan.
[3:16:55] <blackkanye> Time to plug into the GRID
[3:16:59] <DSD24> I like that Raptor skin
[3:17:00] <Vendigear> give us the funky fresh beats dangit
[3:17:06] <huskarl_zap> that dude is sus
[3:17:12] <%LCLSmoothie> looks like a hunter from RE1
[3:17:16] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:17:22] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[3:17:25] <BwdYeti> yep
[3:17:32] <Daxalog> You also get bonus meter
[3:17:42] <DSD24> Its the sandstorm
[3:17:43] <%DensityD> duDudu duDudu duDudu duDudu duDudu
[3:17:43] <%Superbro64> yes, and you get a pip of meter extra
[3:17:46] <nothuzad> bunt conserves and adds to momentum
[3:17:51] <Drunkengen> I just realised that Nitro is Spencer
[3:17:57] <NeerNH> if spike a bunted ball you don't get extra meter
[3:18:00] <Saltmeisterr> the higher the speed the longer it takes for the ball to come out
[3:18:07] <Kenny_Riot> Unlocking the retro stages is nearly impossible in this
[3:18:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[3:18:09] <@Solidus_113> Nitro has a Bionic Cuff, yes
[3:18:16] <DSD24> If I recall Raptors super lets him change the direction of the ball
[3:18:17] <Saltmeisterr> bunting helps mitigate that
[3:18:20] <huskarl_zap> Whens baseball bat boy?

[3:20:11] <Kenny_Riot> @WoolieVersus After 9999, the game becomes a black void.
[3:20:13] <%JakkChiptune> out of curiousity, is the game region locked?
[3:20:15] <%DensityD> at 9999 the game gives a small puff of confetti, a short kazoo fanfare, and you get an achievement
[3:20:18] <Vendigear> i love that stage
[3:20:19] <%DensityD> Keepo Keepo Keepo
[3:20:20] <NeerNH> the audio doesn't go but the visuals do
[3:20:24] <%south_pyne> Its 1 million @Kenny_Riot not 10 thousand
[3:20:28] <Saltmeisterr> @JakkMAU5plays nope
[3:20:29] <imadethis_> at max speed everything disappears, its 1 million
[3:20:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Ascension
[3:20:31] <$ofloofy> This games hype!
[3:20:34] <Lordbahamut780> it turns into JSRF at 9999 lol
[3:20:36] <%LCLSmoothie> your console explodes
[3:20:41] <californaya> yeah, at 1 million, everything just disappears and it's all black and white
[3:20:41] <Kenny_Riot> @South_Exigence I know it goes to a million. I've done it in training
[3:20:43] <DSD24> So the end of Gurren Lagann
[3:20:45] <huskarl_zap> The babe comes down from heaven then hits the ball into another timeline.

[3:22:37] <BwdYeti> flashing lifebar means it can kill that person
[3:22:38] <Daxalog> Flashing life bar means the balls current speed will kill
[3:22:46] <%Vorga1339> @woolieversus that means the ball is going fast enough to kill you
[3:22:48] <Monkeyweed21> It means the next hit will kill

[3:26:45] <BwdYeti> @WoolieVersus work together to get max speed
[3:26:58] <+laxomusic> SourPls
[3:27:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> go into training
[3:27:07] <@Solidus_113> SourPls DAYS
[3:27:07] <Jack_of_No_Trades> My favorite one

[3:27:14] <EDFscout> Try to get speed to 9000+
[3:27:20] <%floralkami> @woolieversus bring it to 9999 for us one good time
[3:27:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> ORDINARY DAYS IS THE BEST TRACK
[3:27:26] <mr_sups> Ordinary DAYS!
[3:27:26] <Kenny_Riot> Ordinary Days v2. Doubt I'll ever unlock the original
[3:27:30] <%DensityD> SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A 'RUDDIE'
[3:27:34] <%DensityD> KappaRoss
[3:27:39] <jokul_> jetsetradio character named jet, nice
[3:27:41] <huskarl_zap> Days of old
[3:27:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> the original is such a fucking amazing track
[3:27:44] <Saltmeisterr> Shred tho
[3:27:53] <+Tennochief> make sure to listen to soundtrack on Youtube
[3:27:56] <%floralkami> @kenny_riot not sure if that's in the game cause this was made for Blaze
[3:27:59] <+Tennochief> Whipz is one of the best songs
[3:28:06] <%DensityD> good try
[3:28:06] <Saltmeisterr> Shred is really good track too
[3:28:13] <%0rond> CBT
[3:28:19] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus go into the game settings on character select to increase ball speed and lives
[3:28:23] <AppleBerryKitty> World is changing we're gonna battle again sometime soon. (when the game stops lagging...) was fun tho.
[3:28:26] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Go to practice to check out max speed
[3:28:39] <Zurinji> Lethal League is the video game version of Wall Ball
[3:28:46] <Monkeyweed21> Hey, Carlos Dangers here, that was some good ass Lethal League, even if Southpyne was burying fools.
[3:28:48] <+Tennochief> I wish they cou;d've brought back Turkish Beat
[3:29:19] <Kenny_Riot> @floralkami It's in the game. You have to unlock the retro version of this stage to get it...but to unlock THAT, you have to get like, 2000 games online or something
[3:29:29] <+Tennochief> and Fkat Attack, FLat Attack fuckin slaps
[3:29:30] <AppleBerryKitty> I wish they brought back the old music tracks. Asked them about it, said it expired and wont renew.
[3:29:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> you want the other best lethal league track, look up Lethal League Scream
[3:29:37] <Monkeyweed21> oh yeah and Toxic is best girl
[3:29:43] <%Exiliator> Try harder Kappa
[3:29:48] <+Tennochief> @AppleBerryKitty aw
[3:29:50] <AppleBerryKitty> I like "error"
[3:29:52] <Saltmeisterr> toxic is best girl
[3:30:09] <%floralkami> @kenny_riot oh damn, that's a shame. not even enough games from the discord to get that, huh?
[3:30:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrMueRMVsTM&list=PLFeuvN1IQa_qei1GZQ-tPvaPmAN5Z-R3r&index=2
[3:30:30] <@Solidus_113> Scream and Headbangeren are like the "main" themes for LL
[3:30:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's lethal league music
[3:30:36] <AppleBerryKitty> you unlock the stages but the music for it is different
[3:30:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> scream is so good
[3:30:49] <Monkeyweed21> The parry stops the intercept, grab passes by parry, cant grab a normal smash
[3:30:56] <AppleBerryKitty> and its 1000 wins per level, like smash melee days.
[3:30:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> ordinary days and scream are legit the best tracks of the first game
[3:30:58] <%DensityD> this has been a great fighting games thrusday
[3:30:59] <+ArcanumArcanum> you guys should try to do predictable smash hits to get the speed as high as possible
[3:31:11] <%DensityD> GivePLZ GivePLZ GivePLZ GivePLZ GivePLZ
[3:31:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Man, was looking forward to playing. Too bad the net code was doodle
[3:31:24] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Remember if you wanna have shit go CURAZEH, you can increase the ball's starting speed in the menu.
[3:31:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> either team up to get it max speed or go into training and get MAX SPEED @WoolieVersus
[3:31:30] <Monkeyweed21> Paradise Fields also has slamming music
[3:31:30] <@Solidus_113> "one more"
[3:31:36] <BlackermanZX> doodOne doodOne doodOne doodOne doodOne doodOne
[3:31:38] <+ItsRatman> "just one more match"
[3:31:38] <Saltmeisterr> SALTY RUNBACK
[3:31:41] <anarchistPastry> doodOne doodOne doodOne doodOne doodOne
[3:31:47] <AppleBerryKitty> i swear the net code was so much better when the game was new, now it's all jank.
[3:31:48] <%Irridium> now it's real
[3:31:50] <+Tennochief> Aw sweet, Snibbit

[3:32:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> psaHoldon doodOne
[3:32:21] <mr_sups> more like a pool guppy
[3:32:34] <%Vorga1339> @CaptainPileDriver it takes ages to get max speed in training mode in Blaze because they nerfed consecutive Smash hits from the same player. In LL it would double the speed every time, if the same player Smashes consecutively in LLB it starts adding half as much speed on each consecutive hit
[3:33:11] <%Superbro64> makes sense
[3:33:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, i believe it, i did it in blaze and it took a minute or two
[3:33:22] <%Vorga1339> would be nice to see them enter the infinite though
[3:33:33] <+Tennochief> DO IT
[3:33:39] <AppleBerryKitty> Oh, recalling 1v1 had tons of rage quitters for a flippin rank (like all fgc games)
[3:33:43] <@Solidus_113> Someone needs to mention how the world of LL works, and why it as a sport exists
[3:33:47] <Kenny_Riot> @floralkami NOPE! There's 2 retro stages that unlock that way, and everyone's noise color kinda has to do with that as well
[3:34:05] <Kenny_Riot> @Solidus_113 Yeah, the lore for this game is wild
[3:34:07] <Saltmeisterr> @Solidus_113 ball go fast
[3:34:07] <+aishman> @Solidus_113 I honestly forgot, it's been some time since I ran through the story.
[3:34:07] <+Tennochief> If anything, at least promote the shit out of its soundtrack
