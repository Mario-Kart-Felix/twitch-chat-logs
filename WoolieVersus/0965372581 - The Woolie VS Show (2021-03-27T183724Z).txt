[0:02:25] <DaKnightWarrior> Let's go!
[0:02:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> sup crew
[0:02:28] <rolothakid> HYPE!!!!
[0:02:36] <+popthemtarts> Battle Coliseum today?!
[0:02:38] <%678saintglock> how goes it fellas
[0:02:50] <%RyTYoung> Let's goooo
[0:03:06] <sinistar71> NO ESCAPE!
[0:03:16] <aiutare47> I don’t know what a “Battle Coliseum” is but it sounds sick as hell.
[0:03:17] <%trustycoyote> I just got a hold of this game a few weeks ago and haven’t played it yet.
[0:03:38] <%zanzibar_junker> I honestly want Ryo as the next Mr. Karate more than Terry as Garou Terry
[0:03:40] <Super_Voltekka> Asura is so underrated
[0:03:45] <+VeraThoris> Cyber Woo!
[0:03:59] <Super_Voltekka> He should be the next SamSho DLC character
[0:04:00] <+The_Death_Owl> I wasn't expecting this game! see me on "xbox network"
[0:04:23] <+HorseWitNoName> Morning boys
[0:04:32] <+VeraThoris> I appreciated that Fuma and ... that other one
[0:04:37] <phatmac16> Fighting game fans be feasting this year
[0:04:46] <%krispen_wa> National Geographic fighting game?
[0:05:11] <%zanzibar_junker> There's super gonna be a World Heroes/ADK team in KoFXV
[0:05:12] <+The_Death_Owl> I believe the National Geographic game is called "Fight of Animals"
[0:05:14] <+VeraThoris> Were in this. Not my favorites in World Heroes (Erick and Kidd are
[0:05:24] <+VeraThoris> But cool to see them acknowledged
[0:05:28] <+NarcissistCactus> yo when's melty blood for honor
[0:05:49] <phatmac16> Imagine someone telling you that we’d be getting a new melty blood game WITH rollback
[0:05:54] <%krispen_wa> No Sion's thighs in the new Melty Blood :(
[0:06:07] <%zanzibar_junker> Like they already put Chris and Shermie in Yashiro's art
[0:06:22] <phatmac16> She’ll come in the next game. Weird that they’re calling this Melty blood when it’s more of a Tsukihime fighting game
[0:06:38] <%krispen_wa> whose blood is melty anyways?
[0:06:50] <phatmac16> SHIKI’s
[0:06:57] <phatmac16> He does have blood swords lol
[0:06:59] <%krispen_wa> and he's not even in the game
[0:06:59] <%zanzibar_junker> was that Yongye
[0:07:04] <%trustycoyote> @krispen_wa is yours not? Huh...
[0:07:05] <%zanzibar_junker> Yongyea
[0:07:15] <%zanzibar_junker> in that picture?
[0:07:20] <phatmac16> SHIKI won’t even be in the game since he’s in the near side routes lol
[0:07:27] <phatmac16> Poor guy
[0:07:41] <%krispen_wa> adapting only the shitty parts of tsukihime first, why
[0:08:08] <phatmac16> Well it’s gonna be rewritten so it’ll be less shitty
[0:08:21] <phatmac16> But yeah the best parts come from the near side
[0:08:41] <phatmac16> Guess Nasu wanted to release something this year after having writer’s block for so long
[0:08:48] <+nanarmor> wasnt it said that far side routes were dlc or something like that?
[0:09:11] <phatmac16> They said in the interview that they’ll talk about the near side game later
[0:09:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:09:12] <@Menitta> new Geography
[0:09:22] <%krispen_wa> *far side
[0:09:40] <phatmac16> Is the Akiha Hisui and Kohaku routes far side?
[0:09:47] <+nanarmor> thought sacchin was supposed to get a proper route too
[0:09:47] <phatmac16> Keep getting the name mixed up
[0:09:51] <%krispen_wa> those are far, shiki and ciel are near
[0:10:07] <%krispen_wa> i thought sacchin was supposed to be near side since apparently it involves nrvnqsr and roa
[0:10:14] <%krispen_wa> but maybe she wont even get a route
[0:10:20] <phatmac16> Thanks lee thinking they’re near side since the stories are about the Tohno manioc
[0:10:22] <%krispen_wa> isnt it sad sacchin
[0:10:24] <phatmac16> Mansion^
[0:10:37] <phatmac16> He did promise the sac chin route so let’s hope so
[0:10:48] <phatmac16> Sacchin*
[0:10:58] <%krispen_wa> what if...melty blood remake IS Sacchin's route?
[0:11:35] <+nanarmor> seems like new melty is based on an alternate arcueid route
[0:11:42] <phatmac16> Well that’s what the first melty blood had so maybe. She probably won’t be in the game since she doesn’t do much in the far side
[0:12:05] <+nanarmor> takeuchi said tohno and arc have unique "lovey dovey" voicelines in battle
[0:12:10] <phatmac16> In the interview Nasu said the story is stuff that he couldn’t put in the VN
[0:12:18] <%OldManJEWc> YOOO what's up people
[0:12:25] <phatmac16> I don’t expect an elaborate story mode like in the original melty game
[0:12:25] <%krispen_wa> BEST VERGIL THEME
[0:12:34] <%krispen_wa> BURY THE LIGHT GTFO
[0:12:35] <phatmac16> I just expect SoL stuff
[0:12:43] <phatmac16> Based
[0:12:46] <%Zero_Jacks> lytMOTIVATED
[0:12:58] <+nanarmor> it apparently has a story mode fwiw
[0:13:24] <phatmac16> Yeah put it doesn’t deal with Tatari and the other melty lore
[0:13:27] <DaKnightWarrior> UMVC3 <3
[0:13:34] <phatmac16> It’s more of a what-if meet up of the charcters
[0:13:46] <%krispen_wa> TATARI was just an excuse for what-if battles anyways
[0:13:46] <+nanarmor> lumina seems to have very little to do with old melty yeah
[0:13:53] <%the_vedo_show> chrisgMotivated
[0:14:04] <BlackermanZX> man i miss Umvc3
[0:14:09] <+nanarmor> wondering if thatll change via expansions or dlc once the remakes are a bit older
[0:14:23] <phatmac16> Yeah, should’ve just called it the Tsukihime fighter since none of the OC’s from melty will be in it
[0:14:38] <+nanarmor> they did also mention that kagetsu tohya is a basis for new melty sooooo nanaya and len pls
[0:14:45] <%krispen_wa> Fairly Solid Blood
[0:14:54] <tacostarvedbeast> this gonna be the one where they walk someone new through the ropes?
[0:14:59] <phatmac16> Len does show up in the old VN in a small role so maybe?
[0:15:03] <+nanarmor> Gaseous Blood
[0:15:37] <~WoolieVersus> @tacostarvedbeast not yet
[0:15:38] <leith_aziz> Hope you had another great day, chat
[0:15:40] <%krispen_wa> fuck, literally no one is playing Return to Yharnam right now. been sitting in place for like 20 minutes trying to get a beckoning bell
[0:15:50] <phatmac16> I Expect DAA members or new enemies to replace the melty cast
[0:15:52] <%krispen_wa> these events are memes
[0:15:58] <tacostarvedbeast> coo coo, still a hype game, looking forward to it
[0:16:06] <+nanarmor> without Warc idk who im gonna play
[0:16:08] <+The_Death_Owl> wait Melty Blood has a story? I thought it was an excuse to gather in the restroom!
[0:16:21] <%krispen_wa> Melty Blood's story is just eroge
[0:16:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[0:16:26] <phatmac16> Lol it has the most story like guilty gear for stuff that matters
[0:16:56] <leith_aziz> @phatmac16: Is that a positive or negative ? I enjoy the GG narrative a lot
[0:17:21] <phatmac16> Well this story will be different so I don’t know. You have to like the Tsukihime VN to care about the story
[0:17:36] <+The_Death_Owl> I enjoy the idea of GG lore but the actual narrative didn't make sense to me until Woolies vids
[0:17:36] <%gatorafan> catJAM
[0:17:40] <leith_aziz> But from what I've heard of Melty Blood, I dont know. It just sounds like the setup for a porn game
[0:17:58] <phatmac16> It’s not a porn game.
[0:18:11] <phatmac16> The new VN will not have porn so that stuff is over
[0:18:13] <%krispen_wa> nah, the porn was before Melty Blood
[0:18:14] <+The_Death_Owl> he's thinking of Arcana Hearts
[0:18:21] <leith_aziz> Well, I wont say anything too much as I never played it
[0:18:22] <%krispen_wa> Melty Blood was them trying to go "legit"
[0:18:22] <+nanarmor> melty blood is just typical fg story
[0:18:40] <phatmac16> Yeah and the porn was added in to sell it to otaku of that era
[0:18:51] <%krispen_wa> new tsukihime is gonna suck because you can't surpress a thousand year old vampire by fucking a curry girl in the ass
[0:19:09] <Dumple_Roe> @leith_aziz that's tsukihime version 0.9 in the early 2000's
[0:19:10] <phatmac16> Lol
[0:19:18] <odd_slater> So you're saying Arcrueid isn't gonna get her back blown out?
[0:19:24] <shadepman> necrodancer woolieGASM
[0:19:28] <%gatorafan> I'm sure the Otaku of this era are still interested in porn daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:19:41] <phatmac16> Yeah but Nasu isn’t
[0:19:47] <LansingWolverine> ooooo I miss this game
[0:19:52] <leith_aziz> Honestly, I don't know whats the community's regular perception of FG stories, but in my opnion, Stories matter, at least they SHOULD matter. When it comes to FG's its mixed. I like KOF and Guilty Gear story, but the rest....
[0:20:15] <NotHereToStream> story matter to me because it helps me like a character
[0:20:16] <%krispen_wa> Type Moon learned that they can sell millions by selling waifus and IMPLYING they want to fuck you, but not showing it
[0:20:17] <odd_slater> Content in general matter
[0:20:32] <%gatorafan> there was a time when people told me Saigado was canon daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:20:35] <leith_aziz> Watch Sugar Punch's video. He goes in about this
[0:20:41] <%gatorafan> people be wild at times
[0:20:46] <+nanarmor> fg story is an excuse to give characters some basic characterization so you can connect to your char on an emotional level
[0:20:48] <phatmac16> Introducing the world and why you should like a character in story mode is neat but lost FG fans will skip the cut scenes
[0:20:50] <+Superbro64> Fun fact, I did not know that there was a marvel 3 vita port
[0:21:01] <phatmac16> Most*
[0:21:02] <jhonxiolonn> Woolie should really try Monster hunter rise..
[0:21:03] <%zanzibar_junker> Initially Mr. Karate was the alias that Ryo's father used when he had to kill people for Geese Howard
[0:21:07] <odd_slater> Damn Saigado was formative to my adolescent years lol
[0:21:08] <%Livelinne> PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise
[0:21:10] <@Menitta> Story in a fighting game helps but when you play the game, it is important to have the characters be as expressive as possible
[0:21:13] <%krispen_wa> you need A E S T H E T I C to sell fighting games
[0:21:18] <phatmac16> Banger alertt
[0:21:26] <%Livelinne> 2020Shred 2020Shred 2020Shred
[0:21:28] <%krispen_wa> the story can be boilerplate as long as characters look hot/cool
[0:21:29] <phatmac16> SourPls
[0:21:35] <DaKnightWarrior> @superbro64  it's not that bad.
[0:21:48] <%gatorafan> WE KEEP ROLLING
[0:21:50] <@Menitta> the vita port has hitbox mode
[0:21:50] <%gatorafan> daedra1CryingTibs
[0:21:55] <phatmac16> Yeah that’s why this new melty blood story will be about introducing Tsukihime to fans of melty
[0:21:55] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[0:21:56] <%zanzibar_junker> Saigado's new style is too samey

[0:22:15] <+Superbro64> @menitta it *does* huh
[0:22:19] <leith_aziz> To be fair, some character arcs details can play INTO the gameplay, its called Ludonarrative synchronicty. For example, in Xrd Axl accepted his powers and became comftorable with using them. And now in Strive, he can use it in gameplay, showing that he's gotten used to his power

[0:23:46] <NotHereToStream> dammit :(
[0:23:47] <leith_aziz> @Menitta I actually agree. The gameplay should characterize your characters and make you intruiged. That should happen DURING gameplay first and foremost

[0:25:40] <Applecannon63> Melty Blood another game bringing back 2D fighters
[0:25:42] <leith_aziz> Apparently Melty Blood was PC exclusive ? And now the sequel has no PC port planned ? Doesnt this alienate the fanbase ?
[0:25:56] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> @gatorafan lmao yeah the villains are WAREZ

[0:26:33] <leith_aziz> That game is not on PC. You should get it
[0:26:34] <OldManDeckardCain> melty blood was never a pc exclusive LUL
[0:26:40] <%gatorafan> Phantasy Star Portable is alright daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:26:41] <dds333a> Yeah
[0:26:42] <+Mordexai0> dot hack//versus is fun
[0:26:46] <DaKnightWarrior> There's SO MUCH on the PS3
[0:26:49] <leith_aziz> RC collection....
[0:26:51] <+krispen_wa> DISSIDIA
[0:26:52] <@Menitta> It hasnt been announced yet
[0:26:53] <leith_aziz> Im F-ed
[0:26:58] <%zanzibar_junker> Jim Ryan doesn't care
[0:27:00] <Applecannon63> rip Disgaea 3/4 PS3
[0:27:00] <%krispen_wa> CRISIS CORE
[0:27:03] <leith_aziz> *R&C
[0:27:06] <dds333a> It was going to go away sooner or later, but yeah, they're just gonna get rid of them
[0:27:15] <dds333a> sucks, man
[0:27:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Quoted from Jim Ryan HIMSELF: "Who would want to play/buy these old games?"
[0:27:29] <%ggbhtg> we're in the jungle, baby
[0:27:30] <+Mordexai0> ACTUALLY someone is making an English translation of Hack Versus so....
[0:27:30] <leith_aziz> Same goes for the GOW trillogy
[0:27:32] <odd_slater> There's a backpat rumor floating around for PS5 but I don't have hope
[0:27:33] <OldManDeckardCain> @Applecannon63 laughs in physical copies of both on vita
[0:27:37] <%krispen_wa> tbf psp is super easy to emulate, but ps3 is a fucking oof
[0:27:39] <@Menitta> Jim Ryan can't say that when Sony sells fucking GOW3 on PS4.
[0:27:58] <@Menitta> I hate it so much
[0:28:04] <Super_Voltekka> A B A N D O N W A R E
[0:28:05] <@Solidus_113> PSNow
[0:28:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh god, TTT2, Grab that as well
[0:28:19] <dds333a> @odd_slater man, I hope, but I doubt it
[0:28:19] <leith_aziz> @Menitta But about the first two ? the PSP ones ?
[0:28:22] <%Jiggisnipe> hopefully emulation gets there at some point and people have a reason to really try now
[0:28:26] <Applecannon63> BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
[0:28:37] <%zanzibar_junker> I have the discs for ultimax
[0:28:41] <Applecannon63> but Sony is like nope
[0:28:46] <leith_aziz> Hope that one gets a re-release with rollback
[0:28:46] <%Zero_Jacks> not gona lie. i emulate it for ease of access
[0:28:55] <%krispen_wa> I can run Dark Souls 3 and sekiro but my pc shits itself with ps3 demon souls
[0:28:57] <leith_aziz> Otherwise, they can make a P5A
[0:28:57] <@Solidus_113> Ultimax is on 360, so it has a higher chance of geting XseX back compat
[0:28:59] <OldManDeckardCain> "Damn, why are people pirating our games"
[0:29:07] <odd_slater> ^^***
[0:29:08] <@Menitta> P4AU for sure. Dengeki Bunko is there but there's a newer version that people are adding rollback to
[0:29:13] <phatmac16> dengeki
[0:29:21] <Estuko> Dissidia :( I have the psp physical copy still hhh
[0:29:21] <dds333a> All those ps2 SMT games
[0:29:29] <leith_aziz> Fes, Portable and.....
[0:29:30] <@Menitta> @Solidus_113 I'm pretty sure they stopped adding 360 games to backwards compat
[0:29:30] <+StrawberryPantsu> JUST SUB TO PS NOW STOOPID Kappa Kappa
[0:29:33] <Applecannon63> P3P…
[0:29:36] <%krispen_wa> P3P...

[0:29:45] <%krispen_wa> P3 FES is PS2

[0:34:57] <Applecannon63> Sion is living in Unist
[0:35:00] <leith_aziz> Didnt it start with Strive ?
[0:35:05] <%Buttface_> @tigerclaws12 the official reason is because nasu's "creator ego" wants it to be on a big screen
[0:35:08] <phatmac16> It jus took the VN forever to come out

[0:36:57] <fernanda_ps2> no
[0:36:57] <%Jiggisnipe> SFV has rollback, it's just poorly implemented and they don't want to fix it

[1:04:26] <+SuperUnhappyman> i wonder how king plays
[1:04:26] <PanicSwytch> The only fighter i had for GBA was SF Aplha 3
[1:04:26] <Bloodhit> Heihachi is unlockable character in this apparently
[1:04:30] <andrewofbob> Is Smash 3DS weird for being an accurate copy of the console version?
[1:04:32] <%ggbhtg> @jinking79 are you asking, are saying?

[1:09:27] <PanicSwytch> Quick put new batteries
[1:09:35] <JdotSweapA> abandon all hope
[1:09:35] <+VariantX7> korean backdashes drained the battery in an instant
[1:09:38] <+skylerpilot> the Tekken Wiki describes it as "While in Cryogenic sleep, her ovum was taken without her consent and used to create Steve Fox"
[1:09:39] <%RyTYoung> RAW
[1:09:39] <dds333a> Lul. Reggie
[1:09:40] <%trustycoyote> RIP Woolie's GBA

[1:09:56] <TheAlmostBlind> 10 out of 10
[1:09:59] <%ggbhtg> SIKE U THOUGHT
[1:10:00] <%Grimlockfly> We did it
[1:10:04] <+The_Death_Owl> Harada said don't ask him for legacy titles
[1:10:09] <%Grimlockfly> 10 out of 10 would recommend
[1:10:15] <+Prowtellen> If I were my 10 years old self with a GBA only I'd probably love that game
[1:10:19] <%X2Eliah> Big ups for BBBABBBBBBABB
[1:10:21] <%ggbhtg> Next time, Woolie is gonna dig up Tekken Revolution
[1:10:27] <Flare3500> I mean there are PSP Tekken 5 and 6
[1:10:28] <%ggbhtg> or Tekken 2 POV mode
[1:10:29] <Tracazoid> That was better than it deserved to be, like that one Power Ranger live action movie a few years back
[1:10:30] <OldManDeckardCain> I'd rather play tekken advance than tekken 4 and 6 LUL
[1:10:38] <%Grimlockfly> woolieONEGUY_BE
[1:10:40] <dds333a> Truth
[1:10:44] <$razielhex> I mean, I played Streets of Rage II on Game Gear and loved it because it was the only Streets of Rage I had
[1:10:44] <TheAlmostBlind> what's next? that card gameboy game?
[1:10:45] <jetjagger222> it was more real than the tekken live action movie
[1:10:46] <HelluvaNohbody> I was scared that I missed NGBC.
[1:10:50] <%TopTieramisu> NGBC PogChamp
[1:10:50] <%trustycoyote> That's a legit Tekken for a handheld
[1:10:52] <@Menitta> I'm going to become a big time tekken advanced streamer now
[1:10:53] <%ggbhtg> Next time, Tekken 2 but ONLY via the Tekken 5 Arcade History

[1:19:07] <tacostarvedbeast> shermi!
[1:19:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> shermie Kreygasm
[1:19:09] <+JohnXuandou> this game is actually great
[1:19:10] <brunoberserk> the ps2 version ??? why not the xboxlive version ? @WoolieVersus
[1:19:11] <Super_Voltekka> The best version of Lee Pai Long
[1:19:13] <+Mordexai0> THAT'S JUST KOF THOUGH
[1:19:15] <Qsmash_> weird concept for a game considering KOF is already SNK vs SNK
[1:19:16] <%Alazull> Alazull subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Big grats to Reggie for getting through Demon's Souls. Looking forward to the journey going forward! Thanks for all the entertainment dudes.

[1:19:20] <%X2Eliah> What is this artstyle
[1:19:20] <+patrickng714> @geltonz there was room for improvement
[1:19:24] <dds333a> OG Athena
[1:19:25] <jetjagger222> aggressors of dark kombat
[1:19:27] <@Menitta> I like those two OCs
[1:19:27] <357Sneak> lytOMG
[1:19:30] <makeiks_rv> @GeltonZ I asked Itsuno for a port with the datesim translation is the minimum :v
[1:19:30] <+JohnXuandou> KoF is a crossover game!
[1:19:32] <%trustycoyote> I think the Ikari Warriors are in here somewhere
[1:19:32] <@Menitta> they look cool
[1:19:33] <dds333a> MUDMAN
[1:19:34] <blackkanye> I like the OCs Kappa
[1:19:36] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[1:19:36] <auso912> wasn't KoF origianlly intead to be SNK vs SNK?
[1:19:38] <+mMayrro> NO ESCAPE
[1:19:38] <%TopTieramisu> way better than maximum impact's OCs
[1:19:39] <@Solidus_113> SNK School
[1:19:40] <+patrickng714> @meltgar Abe and Dart right?
[1:19:42] <GeltonZ> @makeiks_rv Yes.
[1:19:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:19:44] <tacostarvedbeast> why is the main dude just anime egoraptor?
[1:19:48] <dds333a> Well, yeah. kof is a crossover fighter
[1:19:49] <+VariantX7> it being better than Capcom Fighting Jam is a correct assessment...but most things including a punch to the jaw are better than CFJ
[1:19:52] <@Menitta> New Geography
[1:19:56] <%ggbhtg> costumes of the main characters, yesh
[1:20:02] <%X2Eliah> Ohhhh that is definitely a ..... design for th main menu.
[1:20:05] <jetjagger222> yeah true, kamen rider dude and sports gal are pretty good compared to the goobers from MI or ingrid
[1:20:05] <@Solidus_113> nice art
[1:20:07] <+JohnXuandou> there are secret characters as well
[1:20:07] <$razielhex> tong fa rue

[1:20:14] <@Menitta> the art is really nice yeah
[1:20:18] <Meltgar> @patrickng714 Yeah, those "apparently" were good to go, but then hell happened.
[1:20:24] <keogamer> glade xbox still has this available
[1:20:24] <brunoberserk> no secret characters unlocked ?
[1:20:25] <GeltonZ> I love this game. It's the closest we got to a console version of SNK vs Capcom: Match of the Millenium until that Switch port.
[1:20:28] <%TopTieramisu> KOF kind of got its own identity with its own storylines. it's hard to just call it an SNK mashup at this point
[1:20:34] <auso912> portraits looks good
[1:20:35] <+Suneater_Jerome> man I remember playing this on ps2, no idea wtf I was doing tho haha

[1:22:08] <+patrickng714> anyone remember a fake Neo Geo Battle Colisseum sequel rumor?
[1:22:09] <+JohnXuandou> it's not Marvel, but there's a lot of silly move properties and juggles and stuff
[1:22:11] <+Shmario> @WoolieVersus which console u re playing this?
[1:22:12] <makeiks_rv> Why they stoped? It was SFIV and V?
[1:22:13] <%ThatGuyThere03> because they're too expensive
[1:22:13] <OldManDeckardCain> there were games that had good loading on ps2? Kappa
[1:22:16] <%ThatGuyThere03> well
[1:22:17] <GeltonZ> @auso912 Yup. Ai is the Neogeo Fangirl and Yuki is the husbando from the Neo Geo World.

[1:24:04] <+patrickng714> whos the chick between Jubei and SamSho ref in background here?
[1:24:06] <+JohnXuandou> the short dash is important because you can't block immediately after running, but you CAN block immediately after the short dash

[1:25:00] <+JohnXuandou> there are no rolls either
[1:25:12] <%ggbhtg> I wonder if the command list has universals listed
[1:25:13] <Applecannon63> Iori's clan name was originally Yasakani but because of swearing with Orochi they called themselves Yagami

[1:26:38] <+mMayrro> @jinking79 the tag super thing is mostly for removing recoverable health
[1:26:38] <Super_Voltekka> Some characters have special D-Assaults depending on who you pair them up with

[1:28:22] <oAznoUta> somebody calm down that light
[1:28:24] <%TopTieramisu> kyo's DM that creates the fire pillar and then a big aragami is Mushiki
[1:28:28] <TreeLeafBoi> is that an Akuma reference?
[1:28:36] <dds333a> Then Dokugami becomes Poison chew, or Poison bite
[1:28:49] <deafmelone> start with heavy rekka
[1:28:53] <mrpandabear437> does he have qcf k in this?
[1:29:02] <dds333a> Also can't forget about Ya Otome becoming MAIDEN MASHER

[1:33:55] <%TopTieramisu> that kick is a unique followup to NLBC, right?
[1:33:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[1:34:01] <%TopTieramisu> in*
[1:34:06] <brunoberserk> the last one is qcb
[1:34:17] <QuietSandshrew> KOF Spirtes are Spectacular
[1:34:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BODY GA-
[1:34:23] <+JohnXuandou> NGBC shares an input interpreter with KoF03 and XI, also known as the worst input interpreter in KoF history
[1:34:46] <usurper_sos> Need to do more grinding offscreen
[1:34:47] <+OblivionSword1> we got it on camera that's what counts
[1:34:51] <leith_aziz> Rock's sprites are some of my faves. Gotta thank ABItorial for that
[1:34:52] <QuietSandshrew> We getting it
[1:34:57] <brunoberserk> @JohnXuandou worst than neowave ?
[1:35:00] <SomersaultJustice> have they used marco yet
[1:35:05] <Applecannon63> man I hope KoF15's Kyo have this hidden super
[1:35:07] <+JohnXuandou> I think Neowave also uses this input interpreter
[1:35:18] <+Shmario> @Applecannon63 its not even a super
[1:35:19] <QuietSandshrew> Shermie is my fav, plz be in 15
[1:35:24] <QuietSandshrew> jaboodyPray
[1:35:47] <SNK_Dan> Shermie is def in XV
[1:35:47] <%0neReeler> practically confirmed unless they mess up the newface team
[1:35:49] <dds333a> @quietsandshrew she's all but confirmed
[1:35:54] <%TopTieramisu> monkey's paw: shermie's back but she has no hair bangs
[1:36:04] <Applecannon63> of course shermie is gonna be in there because of Yashiro
[1:36:08] <IceyCone> yashiro's in so it's almost certain shermie will be
[1:36:09] <BlackermanZX> thats a sick move
[1:36:16] <DomonTrigger> I wont be satisfied until we get more Heavy D
[1:36:16] <SNK_Dan> SNK posted a picture of Yashiro with a cropped Chris and Shermie lol
[1:36:19] <%jinking79> gonna hate Chris in it
[1:36:28] <dds333a> the only other team Shermie has been on is Orochi Ladies, and that's an edit team. CYS are always together
[1:36:29] <%Afterman_> that folding screen is going crazy
[1:36:38] <%TopTieramisu> heavy D is unironically cool af
[1:36:39] <QuietSandshrew> No Shit! Im Excited
[1:36:40] <%emptyantics> I just hope we get a grown up Chris that resembles orochi and is no longer a teenqger
[1:36:43] <%0neReeler> chris but without CD Kappa
[1:36:44] <BlackermanZX> they should add that move in XVI
[1:36:58] <%TopTieramisu> it helps that he's the only team USA fighter that doesn't have a joke fighting style
[1:37:12] <+Crunchy_the_clown> You can dp after it in the corner
[1:37:13] <leith_aziz> Can't wait to see Duck King revealed. The memes inbound
[1:37:14] <%ggbhtg> dopeness
[1:37:14] <+Crunchy_the_clown> twice
[1:37:21] <%0neReeler> coolest is his punch supers (which look meh in 15)
[1:37:22] <deafmelone> costs meter tho
[1:37:25] <SNK_Dan> I wish SNK would give Terry Quick Burning back ;-;
[1:37:31] <leith_aziz> Its pretty cool
[1:37:33] <Applecannon63> Man how less Shota are they going to make Chris cause if they don't make it I'm disappointed
[1:37:34] <+Crunchy_the_clown> Love this game
[1:37:41] <%ggbhtg> tag supers...
[1:37:46] <%TopTieramisu> mushiki is kyo's best move
[1:37:53] <%TopTieramisu> in terms of hype
[1:37:55] <%0neReeler> Shermie knee
[1:37:56] <%ggbhtg> UNIQUE tag supers, rather
[1:37:59] <DomonTrigger> Terry has Hidden Power in this game right
[1:38:13] <%ggbhtg> Kyo and Iori got a unique tag super
[1:38:22] <%ggbhtg> as you do
[1:38:24] <rusell4> Unique teams
[1:38:35] <%ggbhtg> Try this, Reg? https://strategywiki.org/wiki/NeoGeo_Battle_Coliseum/Walkthrough
[1:38:37] <+Shmario> @WoolieVersus is this XBOX360 Version ?
[1:38:39] <dds333a> Shermie with Irish Whip, my goodness
[1:38:40] <+JohnXuandou> step does not cost a bar unless you cancel into it
[1:38:43] <Super_Voltekka> Ryo and Robert's D-Assault is great
[1:38:47] <deafmelone> they tell you who has them in the move list
[1:38:58] <DedlokPM> NO ESCAPE FROM CROSSING FATE
[1:38:59] <%0neReeler> forgot think the step mechanic breaks the game.. or was that svc
[1:39:14] <%TopTieramisu> i love her fighting stance
[1:39:15] <+JohnXuandou> WAREZ
[1:39:16] <%ggbhtg> war dot ez
[1:39:17] <linSP> WAREZ
[1:39:18] <%ggbhtg> for sure
[1:39:23] <%RyTYoung> OH NO
[1:39:23] <dds333a> With Goodman, as it's CEO
[1:39:24] <leith_aziz> "Can't escape from crossing fate"
[1:39:24] <%678saintglock> i don’t care what anyone says that’s a cool ass character design
[1:39:25] <Applecannon63> Honestly Kyo's best moves are his Divine dust super/Iori's Maiden Mash-like super and his KoF13 Max cancel
[1:39:28] <%cubbywolf> HEROZ
[1:39:30] <%0neReeler> aughts reference

[1:39:44] <Super_Voltekka> WAREZ's is SNK's middle finger to pirates
[1:39:45] <cj_art> i love ai's idle animation
[1:39:45] <%0neReeler> zoomer "what's warez"?
[1:40:00] <auso912> this probably SNK's headcannon as to why they weren't beating Capcom too lol
[1:40:05] <deafmelone> this game takes place in 2017 lol
[1:40:05] <+JohnXuandou> Warez is what us internet boomers used to call file hosting sites
[1:40:18] <Super_Voltekka> Ai and Yuki are walking talking nods to SNK's history
[1:40:18] <%ggbhtg> SNK with all these inputs, nobody ever told them to stop when they should've
[1:40:18] <+JohnXuandou> people would come together to share pirated materials
[1:40:29] <%TopTieramisu> snk and capcom were never on even footing as companies
[1:40:29] <+0neReeler> shenwoo?
[1:40:41] <auso912> so this guys are just the piracy police lol
[1:40:44] <Super_Voltekka> Ai's crouching animation is great
[1:40:46] <dds333a> @0nereeler not entirely

[1:42:26] <DaKnightWarrior> TAKE THAY WAREZ!
[1:42:31] <GeltonZ> Ai is the fangirl from the real world and Yuki is the boy from NeoGeo Land.
[1:42:35] <Super_Voltekka> Keep crouching with Ai for more than 3 seconds
[1:42:39] <%ggbhtg> changii outputto
[1:42:44] <leith_aziz> "Tend to your Pocket#
[1:42:50] <Applecannon63> Snk's Commando
[1:43:01] <%ggbhtg> crouch with Ai for3+ seconds???
[1:43:01] <%emptyantics> I hope we get Yuki and Ai in KOF ALL STARS
[1:43:03] <%ggbhtg> but why tho
[1:43:08] <%0neReeler> maybe slightly better than new kof lead
[1:43:21] <SNK_Dan> Yuki and AI would be neat in KOF XV
[1:43:30] <dds333a> And hell, we already had Neo and Geo as "kinda" console mascots
[1:43:35] <Applecannon63> honestly Shingo should've been team Hero's

[1:43:59] <brunoberserk> you have to change character after the tag combo
[1:44:00] <deafmelone> Atomic Guy
[1:44:14] <%ggbhtg> This might be one of those look  up Supers on Youtube situations with all those systems @WoolieVersus
[1:44:16] <Applecannon63> Atomic Guy is Gridman/Ultraman
[1:44:16] <leith_aziz> Mr BIG
[1:44:20] <%TopTieramisu> shiki Kreygasm
[1:44:22] <Super_Voltekka> Hotaru is Kreygasm incarnate

[1:45:10] <+JohnXuandou> this is the Takuma stance
[1:45:11] <Qsmash_> the takuma stance
[1:45:13] <%TopTieramisu> hands out ryo best ryo
[1:45:13] <dds333a> Almost a Takuma inspired stance
[1:45:15] <%emptyantics> Who did the art for this game? They look incredible!
[1:45:15] <AndreDahMan> I actually like his black gi
[1:45:16] <SomersaultJustice> look at that pop in
[1:45:17] <LoreKeeper_Thal> 98 stance is the best one
[1:45:31] <leith_aziz> Why is there an older version of Ryo ?
[1:45:36] <+JohnXuandou> Mr. Karate can chain cr.B into cr.C, no link required
[1:45:37] <0cash> his portrait art looks great
[1:45:38] <Super_Voltekka> Getting Ocean Hunter vibes with this stage
[1:45:44] <leith_aziz> I feel like they should just have this version for XV
[1:45:49] <HelluvaNohbody> The Stages in this game are awesome
[1:45:55] <usurper_sos> BURNING
[1:45:58] <%0neReeler> art of fighting timeline
[1:46:02] <dds333a> @leith_aziz Ryo has appeared in layer games outside of AOF, so this is a nod to that
[1:46:11] <leith_aziz> Ah, Kim's pants.......
[1:46:14] <%zanzibar_junker> Art of Fighting takes place 10 years before Fatal Futy
[1:46:14] <auso912> the 3d stages aged like a fine milk :/
[1:46:21] <+patrickng714> @leith_aziz this Ryo is from Buriki One

[1:49:28] <+TopTieramisu> kyo's orochinagi looking kinda smol
[1:49:39] <leith_aziz> @GeltonZ Thats a shame, since Gauro ends on a cliffhangher (Rock follows his uncle to find his mom)
[1:49:39] <+Shmario> use that girl from agressors of dark combat ..i guess her name was Kisarah ?
[1:49:41] <+JohnXuandou> the 360 version is not bad but it has forced filtering
[1:49:42] <usurper_sos> a paltroon?
[1:49:48] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus The 360 version has less/worse stages and the improved sprites are kinda weird.
[1:49:55] <Super_Voltekka> Kaede with the Bugs Bunny words LUL

[1:51:49] <auso912> why the F would they grab a iconic boss and change his name to bob?
[1:51:54] <+JohnXuandou> KoF bosses get real bad in NESTS where they start cheating

[2:37:00] <+GalacticaPhanto> The MONKE took the first napkin
[2:37:06] <dds333a> He needs more of a composite mix between actual fashion, and nonsense
[2:37:29] <+JohnXuandou> this game has chains for some characters yes
[2:37:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:38:39] <tacostarvedbeast> @andre11dr idk what u mean, what about beni is jojoish? Kappa Kappa
[2:38:42] <%0neReeler> it's like mortal kombat where projectiles ignore each other
[2:38:50] <0cash> Goodman mirror but cant use monkey when
[2:38:55] <dds333a> @tacostarvedbeast nothing about his face screams DIO, and lipstick is hardly unique, also yeah, Goodman isn't referencing Jojo, whereas beni is a direct ref

[2:41:36] <tacostarvedbeast> maybe its a buff to a super?

[2:44:14] <%emptyantics> Tag Supers?
[2:44:14] <tacostarvedbeast> bikini athena is an inspired choice
[2:44:14] <dds333a> Absolutely, neato picks
[2:44:15] <+JohnXuandou> this game is also kinda MUGEN but this one is fun
[2:44:18] <%ggbhtg> unique tag supers on Youtube?
[2:44:23] <andre11dr> The tag supers tho
[2:44:30] <dds333a> the game isn't too bad either

[2:45:30] <%Jiggisnipe> yep
[2:45:32] <%ggbhtg> how the FUCK is it GONE
[2:45:33] <+dawnks> loookin good wools
[2:45:33] <%ggbhtg> HOW
[2:45:37] <%ggbhtg> actually HOW
[2:45:39] <%Jiggisnipe> the switch to 3d got rid of special intors
[2:45:40] <%ggbhtg> and don't sday budget
[2:45:42] <%Jiggisnipe> intros*
[2:45:49] <%ggbhtg> and don't say budget, fuck that
[2:45:52] <Qsmash_> you get a 10 second cutscene that you'll skip anyway
[2:45:54] <tacostarvedbeast> to expensive?
[2:45:58] <+JohnXuandou> in KoFXIV, Billy will bow to Geese for intro
[2:45:59] <andre11dr> MK 11 is the best you get
[2:46:03] <@Solidus_113> Animations wouldn't be that much different work
[2:46:15] <dds333a> that's what I was saying earlier. dialogue is good, but something better than that is appreciated
[2:46:23] <%ggbhtg> MK11 dialogue is the last hold-out
[2:46:30] <+balouie> marvel VS Capcom 3
[2:46:33] <dds333a> GG has almost full on fights in certain cases
[2:46:37] <@Solidus_113> BBTag had some custom animation intros
[2:46:38] <%jinking79> Sol vs Ky intro in Accent core still the best
[2:46:44] <+the22cstomp> bbtag aint a great game but it had custom intros
[2:46:49] <%ggbhtg> also, FighterZ Dramatic Finishes
[2:46:54] <+OblivionSword1> blazblue has it as well right ?
[2:46:56] <%ggbhtg> kinda
[2:46:59] <%emptyantics> I wish we got more Kyo fights Iori becore fhe fight
[2:47:06] <+FloorBurger> I want Ryu and Ken to fist bump again
[2:47:07] <+the22cstomp> blazblue does have unique intros
[2:47:11] <OldManDeckardCain> sounds sus
[2:47:11] <andre11dr> Yeah Blazeblue has them
[2:47:13] <%ggbhtg> Youtube failing us? NotLikeThis
[2:47:23] <+the22cstomp> ragna/jin, azrael/kagura among others
[2:47:43] <tacostarvedbeast> the only games where i feel there is room for it right now is mvci, smash, and cross battle, everything else feels self contained
[2:47:48] <%jinking79> here a YouTube ad with a Uncensored Rap song
[2:47:50] <dds333a> @ggbhtg yeah, and stuff like that when it harken to canon is great. situation finishes in ASB where the same thing
[2:47:53] <%ggbhtg> options
[2:47:59] <SomersaultJustice> option
[2:48:00] <andre11dr> Blazeblue has unique lines while fighting if your playing as certain caracters
