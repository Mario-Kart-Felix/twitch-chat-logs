[0:01:19] <+maximrx78> my man
[0:01:19] <majima666> woolsworth lad
[0:01:22] <%LastHazzerd> of course the hype train starts after i sub
[0:01:24] <Solidnick18> More strive
[0:01:25] <%Irridium> strive is so much goddamn fun
[0:01:26] <Teh10sorrow> That intro is still one of the greatest things ever
[0:01:30] <DedlokPM> DedlokPM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Octopimp plays Axl Low and yet does not play Axl Low. At least all of his Potemekin vs Axl Low match-ups will now be 10-0 no matter what the outcome. woolieMIRIN
[0:01:32] <leith_aziz> Played the beta. Loved it!
[0:01:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:01:33] <odd_slater> Back to smell the game
[0:01:40] <ECRead> fuujin button go brrrrrrrrrr
[0:01:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if I lick the screen will it come out faster?
[0:01:45] <leith_aziz> I-No was lots of fun. Same with Sol
[0:01:46] <%ggbhtg> KONO R CODO
[0:01:59] <odd_slater> Gotta change air movement. Again. lol
[0:02:00] <+The_Death_Owl> What's the over under on Reggie being a Ram main thesph1MistyThink
[0:02:04] <leith_aziz> unfortunatelyyyy, lobby's still annoying
[0:02:08] <%gatorafan> delayed again Kappa
[0:02:10] <+SquirrelZOD> The matchmaking is still the hottest garbage
[0:02:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> SPIN TO WIIIIN
[0:02:12] <leith_aziz> Also very buggy
[0:02:14] <DaKnightWarrior> Yeah, i'm loving Sol and I-No.
[0:02:22] <MKII> no more random teleporting. it's great
[0:02:23] <@Solidus_113> they're just cabs
[0:02:23] <odd_slater> Yea lobby is meh
[0:02:25] <+FuqBoiSlim> Potemptkin players back in the mud. just what I like to see
[0:02:31] <gameythegameghost> i just dont get why no PC beta tho
[0:02:40] <leith_aziz> It also seems like very time you rank up in the floors, you desync
[0:02:43] <TheAzureOracle> Yeah quick start is what I do and it works great
[0:02:44] <Grimoire_Nice> I like that the screen on the stations shows who they're playing as.
[0:02:46] <+Jungos60> Faust is fun as hell! :D
[0:02:47] <leith_aziz> @gameythegameghost Datamining is easier on PC
[0:02:50] <%drefizz> @gameythegameghost remember sfv's beta?
[0:02:56] <%drefizz> thats why
[0:03:05] <gameythegameghost> @drefizz I forgot about that honestly
[0:03:06] <ECRead> Pot... my baby boy... NotLikeThis
[0:03:08] <+The_Death_Owl> @gameythegameghost Because Arcsys is scared we'll crack the game and pirate it
[0:03:08] <+pupil31> Hmmm
[0:03:11] <%ggbhtg> ggbhtg subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 9 time 9 time 9 month champion
[0:03:15] <odd_slater> May gang rise
[0:03:15] <Picia000123> the habbo hotel is still there NotLikeThis
[0:03:17] <Bunyanator> Lets Rock
[0:03:22] <leith_aziz> @TheAzureOracle Issue with quick start is that it puts you in a random lobby and you still have to rely on people to pick you in the lobby
[0:03:23] <+Dumple_Roe> @gameythegameghost most likely data mining and leaks are easier on PC, including hacks to make it less fun online
[0:03:23] <%Irridium> cowards got their way pot got nerfed. a shame
[0:03:25] <+TrebassTV> hmmm LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:03:27] <%Brightstreak> OMG I got my first win in a fighting game ever last night
[0:03:27] <andre11dr> POOLS CLOSED
[0:03:30] <majima666> habbo lol
[0:03:30] <%Eaglestrike117> Man
[0:03:32] <+pupil31> Smells like teen spirit
[0:03:33] <DaKnightWarrior> Nice

[0:03:48] <%drefizz> Who has Reggie been playin?
[0:03:56] <%Eaglestrike117> Wool has not only made it to heaven
[0:03:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he LOVES it
[0:04:00] <%Eaglestrike117> WOOL IS A HEAVEN VIP NOW
[0:04:00] <%Brightstreak> and I landed a heavenly pot buster. I'm on the moon
[0:04:01] <odd_slater> Ram smells like cinnamon probably
[0:04:03] <leith_aziz> @Brightstreak congrats
[0:04:07] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:04:10] <enddword> CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat
[0:04:17] <@Solidus_113> Octo has to fight himself in his worst matchup LUL
[0:04:21] <Saltmeisterr> he fucking LOVES onigiri
[0:04:23] <jvilly96> I wanna watch but I’m stuck at work doodHokey
[0:04:25] <ECRead> Octopimp always wins
[0:04:28] <SonicFourtex> its prolly Tager do
[0:04:29] <leith_aziz> Pot's just a soldier with a super suit
[0:04:34] <Pookiedaexzile> No one cares is the answer
[0:04:36] <+TrebassTV> Probably tager
[0:04:37] <SvenHolgersson> The one you like better loses
[0:04:41] <leith_aziz> He has a lot of muscle though
[0:04:43] <%Wool> Tager's just a soldier but heavily modified
[0:04:44] <%ggbhtg> doktor
[0:04:55] <odd_slater> Tager is kinda nuts lol
[0:04:57] <%Eaglestrike117> Potemkin legit built different
[0:04:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Blazblue will never be cool
[0:05:03] <leith_aziz> Basically, Pot has a mutation that doesnt stop his muscles from growing
[0:05:19] <leith_aziz> The suit holds his muscles in place
[0:05:28] <+The_Death_Owl> Arcsys is gonna have to she'll out cash for Woolie to learn the Blazblue lore LUL
[0:05:29] <Yenwai> Hey Woolie, i saw you video about how to get into a fighting game, i tried to look up stuff for Bloody roar 4 but cant find anything past videos of the regular command attacks, is Bloody roar dead/bad? should i look for a different game to get into? thanks~!
[0:05:31] <%drefizz> does that mean pot is good in bed?
[0:05:36] <DasFreekman> i gotta rest my thumbs. too much pot buster practice
[0:05:45] <deviljhojho_> colossal W
[0:05:46] <@Solidus_113> BRI'ISH
[0:05:49] <odd_slater> It's crazy that Blazblue only fans are probably feel how GG fans felt when Blazblue was getting all the love lol
[0:05:50] <%LastHazzerd> WAT
[0:05:53] <DaKnightWarrior> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:05:54] <leith_aziz> Was nice seeing him in chat
[0:05:54] <DasFreekman> octoSad IM PROUD OF THAT BOY octoSad
[0:05:55] <Saltmeisterr> BRI'ISH
[0:05:55] <%ggbhtg> s i c k
[0:05:57] <SonicFourtex> gratz octo
[0:05:57] <Afrosamasenpai> 10 - 0 MATCH UP
[0:05:57] <+BottledLineArt> octoKnife octoKnife octoKnife
[0:05:57] <Solidnick18> that is very cool
[0:05:58] <%ggbhtg> sicketh
[0:05:59] <andre11dr> Oh that's cool
[0:06:00] <leith_aziz> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:06:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he got the loicense
[0:06:04] <+ghostfaceninja_> so proud a legit fan of the series got the gig
[0:06:21] <leith_aziz> Also, I-No in dub is voiced by A18 in DBZA
[0:06:21] <%drefizz> I was hoping you were Nago LUL
[0:06:26] <%Sparkseid> big congrats
[0:06:35] <+RemiRottie> His Axl performance is so much fun, captures the "head empty, but happy" vibe perfectly
[0:06:37] <NotHereToStream> the sol nerfs sucks :(
[0:06:41] <PersonifiedTFT> its cool he got paper but oh man I can't stand octo's fake cockney accent
[0:06:43] <%ggbhtg> "What's gud" moments
[0:06:46] <Pookiedaexzile> WIAT WHAT?
[0:07:06] <@Solidus_113> Octo is in fact a voice actor
[0:07:17] <leith_aziz> I listened to the dub. For the most part I liked it. Sol's the only one I straight up dislike. Potemkin is dissapointing and Ram doesnt sound in character
[0:07:18] <enddword> do you think they'll release any alternative skins that are more lewd in GGS?
[0:07:24] <nothuzad> @RemiRottie I maen he has been quoting joey wheeler for over a decade now VoHiYo
[0:07:31] <nothuzad> so he had all the training for it
[0:07:31] <@Solidus_113> Sol's the only weird one yeah
[0:07:35] <Solidnick18> kaiji tang is a voice i believe
[0:07:38] <+The_Death_Owl> can you select dub per character?
[0:07:40] <winner_92> is octo the same guy who does kaiba reads of people on twitter
[0:07:40] <leith_aziz> @Solidnick18 Faust
[0:07:40] <lostcolors> kaiji tang for faust
[0:07:44] <MKII> what happened to Sol's character ”GUN-- haha tricked ya”
[0:07:46] <Saltmeisterr> Kaiji is faust ye
[0:07:48] <+thekouma> Dub ino Kreygasm
[0:07:49] <Solidnick18> yeah faust
[0:07:49] <odd_slater> WE HAVE THE MEATS
[0:07:49] <%drefizz> @leith_aziz sol seems to be vastly seen as weird for the dub
[0:07:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @leith_aziz that said, this time around ram sounds much better than in sign
[0:07:53] <%LastHazzerd> he really does sell me on wanting Onigiri
[0:08:00] <Solidnick18> ichiban
[0:08:01] <leith_aziz> As a Y7 fan, you wont see me talk shit about Fausts voice. Love ichiban
[0:08:02] <%Wool> YAKISOBA PAN
[0:08:02] <Applecannon63> Sean Chiplock is so good as Ky
[0:08:03] <@Solidus_113> Jamison Price is Leo. Papa Nier
[0:08:05] <DasFreekman> @woolieversus have you heard Ky's "I'm falling line"
[0:08:06] <leith_aziz> GAME OVAAH
[0:08:07] <+RemiRottie> @nothuzad True! Going from Joey to Axl just makes too much sense lmao
[0:08:12] <+thatbossnoodle> it's weird that Pot main extrordinaire Octopimp is Axl
[0:08:13] <Saltmeisterr> and GEARLESS JOE
[0:08:14] <Solidnick18> okay
[0:08:18] <Pookiedaexzile> I guess he was their Number One Choice
[0:08:18] <Solidnick18> sorry lol
[0:08:23] <+athuramn> y'all are lookin glowin today
[0:08:25] <mr_sups> He was in 13 sentials too
[0:08:29] <%ggbhtg> Who's Gio, chat?
[0:08:33] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 Dub Leo is best Leo voice
[0:08:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:08:37] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Every now and then your camera blinks out for a second
[0:08:37] <%LastHazzerd> hit with the bat
[0:08:40] <Applecannon63> Ky voiced by Sean Chiplock is very fitting
[0:08:41] <Saltmeisterr> Gio is Lillimar
[0:08:41] <leith_aziz> Sol is still Sol believe me
[0:08:45] <DasFreekman> papa nier as leo
[0:08:47] <leith_aziz> I can still Unga HARD
[0:08:47] <MKII> too many nerfs tbh
[0:08:49] <%ggbhtg> Errbody getting the Monkey's Paw, huh?
[0:08:50] <%Sparkseid> the nerfs hurt
[0:08:56] <andre11dr> I no has a big hat
[0:08:56] <Afrosamasenpai> GIMME OLD HAMMERFALL
[0:08:58] <leith_aziz> Pot's just less stupid
[0:09:02] <@Solidus_113> you can punish hammerfall free
[0:09:05] <Applecannon63> Everyone's jumps are nerfed
[0:09:06] <leith_aziz> Chipp seems buffed
[0:09:07] <lostcolors> Nago loops got changed
[0:09:07] <+RealThiele> pot still bustin
[0:09:09] <%LastHazzerd> can't hurt the Pot
[0:09:14] <DedlokPM> That new Nago Health Drain tho doodSad
[0:09:15] <NotHereToStream> no more vortex loops :(
[0:09:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> pot isnt stupid now
[0:09:16] <Mirakei> Show me on this doll where Arcsys nerfed you
[0:09:17] <odd_slater> 🐬TOTSUGEKI🐬
[0:09:20] <WakeUpThrow> Please tell me heat knuckle is unblockable again
[0:09:24] <DasFreekman> pots corner nonsense haf to be reined in
[0:09:26] <%gatorafan> sajamDeku
[0:09:27] <Saltmeisterr> the air stuff im like ehhhhh
[0:09:30] <+The_Death_Owl> The game has been rigged to Potemkin's favor
[0:09:33] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[0:09:36] <deviljhojho_> MY LIEGE
[0:09:36] <%ggbhtg> MUH CHARACTER DEAD !!1111!!111
[0:09:38] <leith_aziz> @NotHereToStream They were fun I know, but I was not surprised in the slightest
[0:09:39] <%LastHazzerd> "This game has NO honor"
[0:09:40] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> POT MAINS RISE UP
[0:09:40] <Pookiedaexzile> They Nerfed a Grappler? Oh the game over
[0:09:41] <ECRead> @wakeupthrow ... I'm sorry
[0:09:42] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[0:09:44] <Pookiedaexzile> We gotta go home
[0:09:45] <leith_aziz> Sounds like Twitter allright
[0:09:47] <orpleborple> everyone has been stripped
[0:09:55] <NotHereToStream> @leith_aziz yup :(
[0:09:58] <andre11dr> Ive been playing I-No and she definitely feels slower than in previous games
[0:10:02] <+Teelor32> "why are my jump ins not taking 80%"
[0:10:06] <sleeperagentkleenex> I don’t think anyone was truly buffed
[0:10:09] <@Solidus_113> Ino feels real slow
[0:10:13] <NiSoKr> Except Sol. He can do what he wants
[0:10:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'm fine with pot not being stupid
[0:10:18] <leith_aziz> I played I-No. She felt fun
[0:10:20] <+invalid_robin> this is the first beta I played and I'm really like Ramlethal
[0:10:26] <Afrosamasenpai> only bias
[0:10:31] <WakeUpThrow> @ECRead gfdi. Ty anyway
[0:10:32] <%drefizz> I'm gonna main Anji
[0:10:33] <leith_aziz> She has a lot of interestring combos, though I couldnt pull them off
[0:10:34] <+seduwu> Sol’s dragon install is now an invincible command grab instead of a hit grab
[0:10:34] <+athuramn> whoa
[0:10:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> ram is still solid, some nerfs
[0:10:38] <%drefizz> Fuujin gang
[0:10:46] <leith_aziz> @seduwu Its got buffed HARD
[0:10:48] <NotHereToStream> fuujin overhead hurts
[0:10:49] <Afrosamasenpai> Megafist is punishable on hit!
[0:10:50] <+athuramn> potemkin's changes are real
[0:11:01] <leith_aziz> Ram is still very solid and got some interesting buffs
[0:11:02] <@Solidus_113> free command grab heavy mob
[0:11:05] <@Solidus_113> my LIFE
[0:11:06] <+Teelor32> Heavy Mob is now a command grab, its' insane
[0:11:07] <%drefizz> Only Fans
[0:11:08] <Applecannon63> thats bullshit
[0:11:12] <andre11dr> I'm still waiting for my man Slayer, but until then I-No and Sol will do
[0:11:14] <ECRead> @wakeupthrow real talk though, just go from heat knuckle to garuda impact cuz it sucks them down into it
[0:11:17] <leith_aziz> Megafist is still spammable from what I played against
[0:11:19] <+kebsood> woolies cam is flicking off every now again, just me?
[0:11:25] <@Solidus_113> yes it is
[0:11:26] <leith_aziz> I dont feel the nerfs
[0:11:27] <sleeperagentkleenex> Potemkin still feels awesome tho
[0:11:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> pot was free
[0:11:32] <%LastHazzerd> could be a loose wire
[0:11:43] <+RealThiele> s u i c i d e
[0:11:48] <leith_aziz> Nago's dash seems to take little meter now
[0:11:53] <Applecannon63> Nago blood rush
[0:11:53] <+The_Death_Owl> the reduced mobility helps Pot anyways even with the nerfs
[0:11:55] <Saltmeisterr> his health drains WAY fatser now
[0:12:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Pot go nerfed, Skill floor lowered for the entered
[0:12:03] <leith_aziz> Other moves now though puts gauge HIGH
[0:12:11] <NiSoKr> Leo feels great but I wish he had a good anti air combo
[0:12:14] <andre11dr> Nago definitely got a better dash tho
[0:12:22] <+Sparkseid> health bar just melts
[0:12:34] <leith_aziz> @NiSoKr 2H, 214S ?
[0:12:39] <andre11dr> Like its the same dash but less built up
[0:12:41] <WakeUpThrow> @ECRead Good to know that there's a workaround at least, ty. Still though, the anti-air grab being blockable leaves a bad taste i my mouth
[0:12:44] <MKII> command grab or die
[0:12:45] <+RealThiele> you switch mains LUL
[0:12:52] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[0:12:57] <Pookiedaexzile> LUL
[0:13:00] <andre11dr> He feels really fast now
[0:13:00] <lostcolors> have to hit command grab or target combo to try to balance it out
[0:13:10] <leith_aziz> Man, when I check some combo videos, I find out there's so much we dont know about
[0:13:15] <Smitteys867> Got to play for the first time this beta, having a blast so far!!
[0:13:19] <leith_aziz> So many Sol combos I've never tried
[0:13:25] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ HYPE!!!
[0:13:42] <@Solidus_113> command dash into bite
[0:13:42] <+gg_aleph> @NiSoKr he does, stop listening to Jyiuna. [2]8 RC'd
[0:13:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Any grappler with the words "You have to hit" and not "The fear of the hit" should tell you everything you need to know
[0:14:13] <Applecannon63> apparently Nago's super immediately puts him in Blood Rage no matter
[0:14:16] <+RealThiele> nago zombie movie
[0:14:17] <andre11dr> I haven't seen much Anji but he seems to mostly like AC just mash fujin and get in
[0:14:20] <leith_aziz> S,S at close range seems to be a good mixup into bite
[0:14:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> SPIIIIIIIN
[0:14:37] <leith_aziz> Also, 214H has little recovery
[0:14:48] <gunstars20> I love Anji Spin to win
[0:14:53] <lostcolors> 214H is 0 on block right?
[0:14:58] <Saltmeisterr> his health also drains while he animation locked
[0:15:04] <Saltmeisterr> which is kinda dumb
[0:15:08] <leith_aziz> "Use Fujiin to punish the opponent for playing the game"
[0:15:18] <leith_aziz> Yep
[0:15:22] <@Solidus_113> free command grab with heavy mob now
[0:15:24] <@Solidus_113> I love it
[0:15:25] <%ggbhtg> woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN
[0:15:26] <Asuterisuku> GUILTY GEEEEEAR
[0:15:32] <stormhawk9891> Haha Anji go SPEEEN
[0:15:34] <Pookiedaexzile> " Hey my Boat didn't get stabbed I'm fine"
[0:15:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:15:36] <twoto858> You know when I'm not having fun? When I'm in the lobbies
[0:15:37] <DaKnightWarrior> indeed
[0:15:37] <leith_aziz> Sol player here. Completely satisfied
[0:15:39] <Deko_> leo is still fun
[0:15:42] <Pookiedaexzile> " I'm not wett"
[0:15:44] <%drefizz> they buffed his forward game
[0:15:49] <leith_aziz> Sol is very fun and layered
[0:15:49] <+megaman_sentinel> what is this fun u speak of lol
[0:15:58] <+gg_aleph> causing soft knodwons
[0:16:05] <Applecannon63> Leo lost a combo route but gain more speed and better fireball
[0:16:09] <Solidnick18> everything is changing so yeah
[0:16:10] <+gg_aleph> Leo's only problem is almost everything causing soft knockdowns
[0:16:12] <+McSoliace> leo has some dirt off his command grab
[0:16:18] <leith_aziz> Guys, there's a combo video by HighFight. Check that video out and rethink what you feel ablout combos
[0:16:19] <andre11dr> Sol seems like Sol ,he seems pretty much the same, still dose shit loads of damage
[0:16:20] <+gg_aleph> wth twitch?
[0:16:28] <leith_aziz> It will BLOW your mind
[0:16:35] <Applecannon63> Leo's Command grab is better than before
[0:16:38] <%drefizz> @McSoliace hes got dat stank?
[0:16:52] <Saltmeisterr> oh they might tone it down more Kappa
[0:16:54] <leith_aziz> Mained I-No as well. Very fun
[0:17:06] <nothuzad> stroke that big tree
[0:17:07] <MKII> 1.0 of recent fighters have never been perfect but hopefully they find a balance that makes everyone happy
[0:17:08] <Applecannon63> Ino Floor is Laca
[0:17:13] <Solidnick18> i-no monkaS
[0:17:16] <leith_aziz> Only issue is that 214K whiffs way too much
[0:17:17] <Applecannon63> STROKE THE BIG TREE
[0:17:18] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> I have eaten so many overheads from I-No...
[0:17:21] <Picia000123> Axl seems really fun, though when you get on top of him, he gets beat up really easily, which is fair enough
[0:17:25] <+TotalTortilla> TotalTortilla subscribed with Prime. 
[0:17:29] <%ChoculaUltra> I-no's kit is dope for what Strive is, was kinda afraid she'd lose her uniqueness
[0:17:30] <NotHereToStream> ino has some gaps in her aerial, jab the shit
[0:17:32] <SvenHolgersson> Tight you say
[0:17:35] <SvenHolgersson> lytCANDY

[0:18:14] <odd_slater> ^^
[0:18:16] <+athuramn> I started using compression gloves too, they're handy. it's good protection in the long run
[0:18:17] <Asuterisuku> Playstation D Pads break thumbs so he needs something to protect himself.
[0:18:19] <Saltmeisterr> @ozzrabbit no more kancho
[0:18:20] <@Menitta> I feel the lobby's have improved at the very least

[0:18:39] <@Menitta> at least the stations help a lot
[0:18:39] <MKII> that red is the color of sex
[0:18:40] <%drefizz> Anji is so cool
[0:18:42] <+Teelor32> with Sol's Fafnir it kinda feels like a move i only use if i remember i have it, not sure when to use it

[0:20:55] <odd_slater> catJAM
[0:20:55] <leith_aziz> I-No is dub is voiced by A18 in DBZA
[0:20:56] <Pookiedaexzile> That life drain is wack
[0:21:03] <dandy_bones> NOW IT’S TIME TO FEAST
[0:21:05] <lostcolors> oh time to die
[0:21:06] <+athuramn> @notori_osu it almost looks like it
[0:21:06] <leith_aziz> SAYONARA
[0:21:09] <MKII> welcome to die
[0:21:12] <nothuzad> game si a bit loud compared to your voices
[0:21:17] <+McSoliace> some people just hate certain languages i guess...
[0:21:18] <+jepupu> What's the downside of getting into blood rage?
[0:21:24] <NotHereToStream> STROKE THE  BIG TREE
[0:21:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Death
[0:21:26] <Applecannon63> @leith_aziz holy shit I didn't notice that
[0:21:29] <+RealThiele> the animation for it is punishable
[0:21:30] <WakeUpThrow> YOur health evaporates
[0:21:31] <+gg_aleph> @jepupu massive blood loss
[0:21:32] <mr_sups> Plays Van Helen's eruption
[0:21:37] <reyntime180> @jepupu You lose
[0:21:38] <leith_aziz> @jepupu you lose health FAST
[0:21:39] <Asuterisuku> I am so glad her S attacks and Chemical Love don't sound as annoying.
[0:21:41] <+pupil31> Kreygasm
[0:21:42] <Yenwai> @jepupu looks like life loss and that initial animation lock
[0:21:47] <+jepupu> Oh, I see that now
[0:21:49] <Ramasama13> @jepupu can't use specals, and rapid health drain
[0:21:53] <leith_aziz> gg
[0:21:54] <Pookiedaexzile> That that is the downside of Blood Rage
[0:21:58] <+pupil31> Yes
[0:22:00] <ShellysDead> S L A P
[0:22:01] <DingusMcBaseball> the blood thing is so risky
[0:22:01] <lostcolors> blood gauge is a bitch and then you die
[0:22:05] <%Deft_Thought> @jepupu Your health drains, you lose your special move inputs (but gain a full screen super) and both the start up, and end animation leave you vulnerable
[0:22:05] <mr_sups> Be her Bottom Bitch
[0:22:06] <+ghostfaceninja_> FeelsBadMan its gets punished every time
[0:22:06] <Solidnick18> eh
[0:22:11] <HarmlessCrow> New Nago gotta spam that command grab to keep blood in check
[0:22:13] <leith_aziz> Blood Gauge is dangerous
[0:22:15] <Deko_> animation is SO SMOOTH
[0:22:18] <@Solidus_113> a max of 3 rematches
[0:22:22] <%drefizz> idk why but the amount of moaning she does makes me uncomfortable, idk why
[0:22:23] <leith_aziz> @Deko_ Welcome to Arcsys
[0:22:28] <Mirakei> blood gauge only increases when you use specials right? Can't you rely on patience and normals to let it go down?
[0:22:30] <Saltmeisterr> theres some really good lines in the dub
[0:22:31] <+jepupu> Better get those bites in then
[0:22:33] <Applecannon63> 3 match is kinda bullshit
[0:22:35] <+FuqBoiSlim> It took em 2 betas but they added a rematch button 🦀🦀🦀
[0:22:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[0:22:36] <%Deft_Thought> @jepupu You do a LOT more damage but its dangerous to be in there and not have a clear way out
[0:22:43] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:22:43] <leith_aziz> @drefizz Its just more obvious in a language you know. This was always a thing in JP
[0:22:44] <andre11dr> Ino has crazy amount of animation on her
[0:22:48] <nothuzad> Applecannon63 only in ranked I think - its unlimited in teh open lobbies
[0:22:54] <%LastHazzerd> 3 rematches? or 1 match and 2 rematches?
[0:22:57] <DaKnightWarrior> I love his voice LUL
[0:22:57] <%Sparkseid> thanks nagoriyuki
[0:22:57] <+gg_aleph> Damn, his dub is great
[0:22:59] <%Brightstreak> yo I wanna get my ass beat by woolie/Reggie so bad
[0:23:01] <%drefizz> "Wanna see heaven?" *Slap*
[0:23:03] <+jepupu> I-No's special inputs have become so much more manageable now
[0:23:04] <+shoryukenabotch> BLOOD PRESSURE  BE RISING
[0:23:05] <odd_slater> I'm okay with the 3 rematches on the tower
[0:23:09] <nothuzad> LastHazzerd 3 rematches
[0:23:16] <%drefizz> Yeah nago's voice is super fitting
[0:23:16] <%LastHazzerd> oh neat, 4 matches total
[0:23:21] <Deko_> i wanna hear nago's taunt dubbed LUL
[0:23:23] <dandy_bones> They went all out on I-No’s presentation
[0:23:27] <%gatorafan> not a fan of the dub so far, guess I'm too used to old voices and tones daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:23:27] <nothuzad> LastHazzerd ah sorry I said it wrong - 1 match 2 re-runs
[0:23:28] <leith_aziz> im starting to see why people like Eng Nago
[0:23:30] <+gg_aleph> @LastHazzerd no, 3 atches, 2 rematches

[0:23:37] <Applecannon63> I-no's english va is super horny than the jp dub
[0:23:38] <%LastHazzerd> ah so the other thing then
[0:23:40] <lostcolors> you gotta delay that command grab on f.S,S a lot woolie
[0:23:54] <+athuramn> yeah ino's presentation is on point @parentheses8
[0:24:00] <+RealThiele> LUL
[0:24:02] <iacus_> Where does his helmet go?
[0:24:07] <leith_aziz> SAYONARA
[0:24:09] <%kyh9> Subtitles inconsistency
[0:24:10] <%drefizz> subtitles no fit
[0:24:11] <+Cobaltor_252> @iacus_ don't worry about it
[0:24:12] <+FuqBoiSlim> DIVE IN LIKE COLD STEEL gigaboOtsMJowMAX gigaboOtsMJowMAX gigaboOtsMJowMAX
[0:24:16] <+ghostfaceninja_> ??? it didn't match the text tho
[0:24:18] <nothuzad> subtitles didnt match at all
[0:24:25] <leith_aziz> Subtitles seem to stick to JP script
[0:24:28] <Applecannon63> subtitle is the jp translation
[0:24:31] <%drefizz> subtitles are for the jp voices
[0:24:34] <leith_aziz> which can be bothersome
[0:24:36] <%ggbhtg> GG subtitles are always wrong, huh LUL
[0:24:37] <UnfilteredComic> not the full game yet
[0:24:40] <+FuqBoiSlim> don't worry guys they'll fix it in the full release :) :) :)
[0:24:47] <%gatorafan> Yakuza dubs, this is not daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:24:52] <+demystify_fist> they probably had to rewrite the dub to match the lip flaps
[0:24:53] <%gatorafan> at least not yet
[0:24:57] <+megaman_sentinel> that bite is a lot quicker
[0:25:00] <%ggbhtg> @FuqBoiSlim Just like in Xrd :)
[0:25:02] <+RealThiele> i want pat and woolie to rematch before end of beta
[0:25:02] <andre11dr> There's that speed
[0:25:03] <+demystify_fist> and didn't have time to go back and change the subs
[0:25:04] <+jepupu> Talking like that is a pretty good character shtick.
[0:25:08] <dandy_bones> I’m still holding onto hope for Instant Kills
[0:25:09] <+FuqBoiSlim> @ggbhtg exactly :)
[0:25:11] <Josef_Stryker> I won't face my doom, SAYONARA
[0:25:13] <puluxor> I'm usually the defender of English dubs, but I'm simply not feeling this one... tyrantPain
[0:25:16] <+Superbro64> @gatorafan this is about on par with guilty gear xrd sign. Not sure what was expected
[0:25:18] <+athuramn> woolie literally blinked at the beginning and at the end of the round
[0:25:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Argo Nago
[0:25:21] <leith_aziz> @demystify_fist In the end, proper lipsyncing is just better, as difficult as it may be
[0:25:22] <+gg_aleph> I hope we can slect the dub individually for each character
[0:25:33] <+Superbro64> Though personally I always liked the Xrd dub. Not BB Tier, no
[0:25:37] <andre11dr> On that day, she died
[0:25:39] <+ghostfaceninja_> team I-No blasting off agaaaaiiiinnnnn
[0:25:45] <%Deft_Thought> Crouch jab might work there for Reggie
[0:25:48] <DedlokPM> @drefizz a combo of being based on a older script and not yet updated to match the dub lines
[0:25:50] <leith_aziz> I do hope that we can manually change language for each character. Cause there are some I preferin ENG
[0:25:52] <+jepupu> Did Nago get buffed a lot this time?
[0:25:59] <Pookiedaexzile> nah
[0:26:08] <%gatorafan> @superbro64  never tried it myself since I jumped straight it rev. I heard it was bad.
[0:26:08] <dandy_bones> I think this dub is pretty good outside of Sol and May
[0:26:09] <Pookiedaexzile> oppisite, Woolies just good
[0:26:13] <lostcolors> nerfed questionably?
[0:26:13] <%drefizz> @DedlokPM dont worry I know
[0:26:21] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:26:22] <Applecannon63> The Xrd's dub is how quiet they were cause crappy audio quality
[0:26:23] <+jepupu> Anji seems to have insane damage right now
[0:26:23] <+Superbro64> @leith_aziz if it works like BBTag, then your opponent may be jp or eng dub depending on their settings for online matches
[0:26:25] <Asuterisuku> Good Low Profile
[0:26:26] <+ghostfaceninja_> BIG DROPS LUL
[0:26:28] <%ggbhtg> el botcherton
[0:26:44] <+FuqBoiSlim> Dropriyuki
[0:26:46] <leith_aziz> @Superbro64 I know how it works right now. Its like that
[0:26:59] <+Superbro64> @gatorafan It was not as good as BB. Whether this is better, your mileage may vary
[0:27:01] <+jepupu> The window to start doing the dust combo is really tight
[0:27:11] <%drefizz> damn
[0:27:11] <leith_aziz> I played Sol in JP, but my opponent was using Dub, so when I watched his stream it was ENG
[0:27:22] <+Superbro64> Slayer in the Xrd dub was a dude doing a sean connery impression, it twas neat
[0:27:22] <+DesDavis> can you set the language per character like SFV?
[0:27:27] <dandy_bones> Nope
[0:27:28] <sleeperagentkleenex> I feel like Nago’s voice should be deeper
[0:27:30] <@Solidus_113> not in the beta
[0:27:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Is Nago  of the Rich Homie Quan school of going in
[0:27:33] <+FuqBoiSlim> "Take it" 😳😳😳
[0:27:33] <OkamiDude15> If you not confident in doing the full dust combo you can mash out a less damaging one auto combo
[0:27:36] <@Solidus_113> but I REALLY HOPE they add it
[0:27:44] <+ghostfaceninja_> ThankEgg
[0:27:45] <$ArCielArDor> damn he just reached across the screen
[0:27:48] <andre11dr> I-No is such a cool concept, time traveling rockstar witch
[0:27:51] <Yenwai> what kind of character is Kagoriyuki? i can see I-no looks like a zoner
[0:27:52] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:27:53] <jepupu> jepupu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! woolieSPICE woolieVS woolieKICKDAD woolieGLORY
[0:28:01] <dandy_bones> Can’t believe they didn’t get Woolie to voice Nago
[0:28:11] <leith_aziz> @Yenwai Samsho character
[0:28:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Nago: I'll blood rage to gain the life lead, and then lose it"
[0:28:13] <+Superbro64> I-No *definitely* has a different voice actress, I can tell that much
[0:28:20] <Cavumentum> Only pixel that matters is the magic pixel
[0:28:20] <+megaman_sentinel> was that full screen
[0:28:25] <%LastHazzerd> she said you scream like a girl
[0:28:26] <+Superbro64> I do know some chars reprised their roles, see: Leo, Sol
[0:28:33] <leith_aziz> @Superbro64 Android 18 in DBZA
[0:28:36] <%nintega010> who is playing who?
[0:28:36] <Deko_> we can get a woolie voice pack on pc maybe
[0:28:38] <%drefizz> when I heard Octo was Axl, I was hoping Woolie was Nago, thou Nago's VA is a good second LUL
[0:28:38] <+Superbro64> Ky has a different VA, which is funny
[0:28:39] <Yenwai> whats a smasho?
[0:28:42] <DomonTrigger> please land her grab
[0:28:46] <Yenwai> never heard that before
[0:28:48] <+Superbro64> @leith_aziz a18?
[0:28:49] <BreakersAweigh> its so wild to me seeing english voices come out of guilty gear characters
[0:28:52] <%LastHazzerd> oh yeah, i hope reggie lands a grab
[0:28:54] <leith_aziz> Leo sounds better in ENG funnily enough. He just sounds WAY too good
[0:28:58] <+RealThiele> reggie warming up
[0:28:59] <+gg_aleph> @Yenwai samsho. Samurai shodown
[0:29:03] <leith_aziz> @Superbro64 thats what I heard
[0:29:05] <+ghostfaceninja_> is I-no considered unga?
[0:29:06] <%jepupu> Strive gives me an identity crisis because none of my former mains (Zappa, Dizzy, Slayer) are in
[0:29:12] <Saltmeisterr> @leith_aziz cuz its papa nier/sojiro
[0:29:19] <dandy_bones> And then they get Pat to voice Potemkin
[0:29:19] <+LandOfTheWay> @leith_aziz jameson price always sounds good
[0:29:22] <andre11dr> Let's see if Reggie remembers he has a grab
[0:29:23] <DaKnightWarrior> nice
[0:29:30] <Solidnick18> sick

[0:29:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> I-No likes the tip
[0:29:46] <+gg_aleph> @parentheses8 Pat should voice ABA's key

[0:30:01] <leith_aziz> GG
[0:30:04] <nothuzad> ram also get her super long taunt back (although different dialogue)
[0:30:05] <DaKnightWarrior> Batta batta SWING!
[0:30:06] <+athuramn> that was so clean
[0:30:07] <%LastHazzerd> Grand Slam
[0:30:07] <+Shishi1205> I played Pot last beta but man he feels rough this time. Trying Anji now
[0:30:12] <+pupil31> Yep
[0:30:15] <%jepupu> @leith_aziz I've been trying Ramlethal so far. She's weaker on this beta for sure, but I like the range
[0:30:21] <enddword> perfect lol
[0:30:22] <KnightAsteran> is I-No's full theme in?
[0:30:28] <FunnyCrimes> zato feels so good now that he has actual plus frames on his command grab
[0:30:29] <Pookiedaexzile> That life drain is ridiculous
[0:30:30] <Saltmeisterr> no new themes
[0:30:32] <leith_aziz> @KnightAsteran No new themes are in this beta
[0:30:33] <+Superbro64> @nothuzad ram has several super long taunts, in fact
[0:30:33] <%drefizz> no knight
[0:30:35] <Applecannon63> that KO bg is new
[0:30:36] <%gatorafan> Oh yeah, any new music?
[0:30:42] <NotHereToStream> no
[0:30:44] <Saltmeisterr> @gatorafan nope
[0:30:46] <+drewdrew89> https://clips.twitch.tv/OptimisticRelatedCurlewPeteZarollTie-A8tKwn9hhPUuHMk_
[0:30:47] <odd_slater> No full OST isn't in yet

[0:30:49] <NotHereToStream> dandyism
[0:30:49] <%gatorafan> FeelsBadMan
[0:30:51] <+athuramn> LOL nago's lines are dope
[0:30:51] <dandy_bones> I’ve been one of the few people playing Zato
[0:30:53] <+ghostfaceninja_> FAX: waifus sell units. Dizzy, Jam, Baiken will very likely make it in
[0:30:54] <nothuzad> Superbro64 I have only seen the "are you feeling lonely?" one yet V:
[0:30:55] <ullyzeez> bruh wtf why are you using the dub?
[0:30:56] <leith_aziz> I love Zato in ENG as well. Matt Mercer is always a win.
[0:30:59] <+RealThiele> reggie why you gotta make me into a liar
[0:31:05] <%ihavesillyknees> The characters are so fuckin cool
[0:31:09] <leith_aziz> @ullyzeez What kinda question is that dude?
[0:31:11] <%jepupu> I want Zappa back, but that's very unlikely...
[0:31:13] <Saltmeisterr> @ullyzeez for fun :)
[0:31:18] <%Akizea> @ullyzeez cause it's not bad. calm down lol
[0:31:19] <Applecannon63> Oh jeez Weebs complaining about Dubs
[0:31:24] <odd_slater> @ullyzeez He likes Nago's VA
[0:31:26] <%CalderGaming> woolieFUN
[0:31:32] <+Superbro64> @nothuzad Really hope they add in some character vs character dialogue depending on the matchup, Xrd Sign had that if I recall
[0:31:36] <%drefizz> damn he goes ham on the line
[0:31:41] <dandy_bones> Zappa did lose his ghosts and stuff
[0:31:42] <%jepupu> I-No has nice pressure
[0:31:48] <andre11dr> Oh Zato is Matt Mercer,that's cool
[0:31:54] <Pookiedaexzile> So Nagos blood rage is only useful when you're already in the lead
[0:31:56] <%CalderGaming> as long as EN sol's not ono stream
[0:31:59] <Pookiedaexzile> as of this beta
[0:31:59] <+bluebreadtoons> wow it looks like Nagoryuki's been massively improved
[0:32:00] <Ardisan_> I wish I could play I-No well
[0:32:01] <+FrostedZaibatsu> You can grab her "Stroke the big tree" dont let her get away with it
[0:32:02] <+Superbro64> During a rival fight in Xrd's arcade, there was special mid fight dialogue, which was cute
[0:32:02] <nothuzad> Superbro64 yea there was some fo that - hard to tell. we are laos missing IKs IF they even come back
[0:32:04] <AllenDeadman> they did Nago dirty
[0:32:08] <dandy_bones> I think Testament is coming back
[0:32:17] <enddword> this stage is to dark bruh
[0:32:21] <leith_aziz> @Superbro64 That is in this game, but somehwat specific. Sol and Ky have unique dialouge. Same for Sol Vs Nagoriyuki or  Leo Vs Ramlethal
[0:32:22] <andre11dr> I won't lie i haven't used the dubs at all because the Xrd dub was pretty bad
[0:32:25] <nothuzad> let ino stroke the big tree VoHiYo
[0:32:26] <+RealThiele> positive
[0:32:27] <%Deft_Thought> @Ardisan_ I-No is a lot less mechanically complicated in Strive. Worth a try
[0:32:32] <ullyzeez> well considering that woolie is the KING of "but muh japan" i expected him to go with the JP dub
[0:32:34] <+Superbro64> @nothuzad hard to justify IK's with the damage being how it is
[0:32:36] <%drefizz> LOL
[0:32:45] <+Superbro64> @leith_aziz SeemsGood
[0:32:49] <nothuzad> Superbro64 absolutely - its just a flavour thing at this point
[0:32:50] <Applecannon63> @andre11dr mostly because the audio quality of the dub was bad
[0:32:50] <DomonTrigger> has Reggie used a single super
[0:32:52] <leith_aziz> NICE
[0:32:53] <%Deft_Thought> YEAAAAAH
[0:32:53] <DaKnightWarrior> lytMOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED

[0:33:06] <%Sparkseid> sick
[0:33:06] <+LandOfTheWay> best super in the game
[0:33:06] <SvenHolgersson> LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:33:08] <%jepupu> Zappa's kind of wacky style was so fun in #Reload back in the day. Bullying with zone hazards is probably my favorite mechanic in fighting games
[0:33:08] <dandy_bones> YOOO
[0:33:10] <Advent_Child04> the beta is still up???
[0:33:10] <scarman125> that was fuckin spicy
[0:33:11] <%LastHazzerd> 💀
[0:33:13] <Solidnick18> Nice
[0:33:14] <DaKnightWarrior> I-No got the pressure!
[0:33:15] <odd_slater> YEYEYEYE
[0:33:17] <user_naim> YOOOOO
[0:33:17] <andre11dr> FINALLY
[0:33:21] <SvenHolgersson> DAMNNNNNNNNNNNN
[0:33:22] <leith_aziz> Glad to see I-No made it
[0:33:22] <br0tillathehun> her voice ain't bad
[0:33:25] <andre11dr> It looks really good too
[0:33:30] <enddword> teal Kreygasm
[0:33:30] <+Superbro64> @nothuzad There is that arcade mode tag mechanic thing though
[0:33:30] <%LastHazzerd> hell nah, she a rockband gal, she does vocals too
[0:33:38] <%jepupu> In that sense Faust and Zato are probably closest to Zappa now.
[0:33:42] <+Ancopro> has nago changed much since last beta
[0:33:45] <Applecannon63> Her va makes I-no more horny and dommy
[0:33:50] <leith_aziz> @Ancopro blood gauge stuff
[0:33:50] <+Shishi1205> If I-No gets a perfect she does a solo
[0:33:51] <nothuzad> Superbro64 we still dont know fi tis just an assist mode for arcade/story mode or if they actually do something with it
[0:34:02] <%jepupu> Button mash stagger sucks
[0:34:03] <%Sparkseid> agreed
[0:34:09] <Saltmeisterr> stagger is gross
[0:34:10] <%CalderGaming> can you not waggle the stick still
[0:34:12] <+ghostfaceninja_> @ancopro, she wasn't LUL
[0:34:17] <Ardisan_> Red Nago best Nago :)
[0:34:24] <leith_aziz> Some people want that for the extra combo potential
[0:34:27] <%TotalTortilla> Hey, that's the I-No skin I've been using
[0:34:28] <enddword> red = faster
[0:34:30] <+Superbro64> @nothuzad would be leaving money on the table to have it be offline only, if Im honest
[0:34:33] <andre11dr> If they bring Zappa back, i hope they change sword, it was SO broken in +R
[0:34:40] <leith_aziz> ^
[0:34:42] <+jaayro> god this game looks incredible
[0:34:43] <+Superbro64> more fighting games need dramatic battle
[0:34:44] <andre11dr> Dog is fine
[0:34:52] <+BettyMwwaahh> is Woolies camera a little higher than Reggies on purpose?
[0:34:55] <+Shishi1205> I-NO's intro is so long lmao
[0:34:56] <BreakersAweigh> god these intros are so sick
[0:35:00] <Asuterisuku> I want it to be June. Can it be June?
[0:35:02] <leith_aziz> EYYYYYY
[0:35:02] <sleepy_pixels> Both of the longest intros
[0:35:02] <%LastHazzerd> YOOOOO
[0:35:04] <nothuzad> and also we'll probably get 1-2 characters announced within the release month (no confirmation jsut how they normally have done it so far)
[0:35:05] <Ardisan_> Everyone skips them so lets keep intros long

[0:37:06] <Uselesswhitenoise> SMELL OF THE GAME
[0:37:18] <leith_aziz> Fuk-Yo!
[0:37:28] <orpleborple> If you think about that winpose, I-No just wanted to cool herself down so the sideboob shouldn't even matter
[0:37:35] <ManaSpurt> People who are mad about the new win pose need more human contact.
[0:37:39] <+0wen2_> god they made the blood Guage so fucking bad now
[0:37:44] <%Deft_Thought> @orpleborple But tiddy tho
[0:37:46] <Uselesswhitenoise> does the new beta have any new songs
[0:38:01] <ManaSpurt> @Uselesswhitenoise Nope
[0:38:01] <odd_slater> No
[0:38:01] <ullyzeez> the throws in this game are too fucking good
[0:38:02] <andre11dr> @manaspurt I mean it's the same pose
[0:38:07] <Uselesswhitenoise> sadge
[0:38:08] <NotHereToStream> how about the line where he talks about the onigiri calorific content
[0:38:09] <Solidnick18> ah
[0:38:12] <overkrustice> Dubs make me sad
[0:38:17] <+contramann> Woolie doing local play?
[0:38:18] <%Deft_Thought> @Uselesswhitenoise I think I-No and Anji's songs are in it but I dunno
[0:38:20] <+Shishi1205> yeah subs are for the Japanese voices
[0:38:21] <leith_aziz> @orpleborple The funny thing is that animating it so it matches the old pose actually took some extra effort
[0:38:24] <Ardisan_> Show onigiri taunts or rip
[0:38:35] <%notsoy> only SEGA has the forbidden tech: two sets of subtitles
[0:38:36] <user_naim> So is the air movement nerf another intentional exaggeration for beta purposes, or just their actual intent?
[0:38:37] <+contramann> Also Zato-1's English VA is pretty good  ...but DIO
[0:38:51] <%notsoy> EN zato is matt mercer
[0:38:53] <+Checktrap> @user_naim we dont know
[0:38:55] <leith_aziz> @contramann I love both. Matt Mercer is always a win
[0:39:04] <user_naim> @checktrap oh
[0:39:06] <VJdarkworld> @user_naim we shall all learn on release
[0:39:07] <leith_aziz> @user_naim no idea
[0:39:08] <+contramann> Yeah I love him too... but DIO
[0:39:10] <ECRead> Zato is Dio and Jotaro lol
[0:39:12] <+ghostfaceninja_> there's PLENTY of places to go if you wanna see anime tiddy, its okay if the game you're playing has a little less
[0:39:16] <%ChrisBardow> General sentiment from 1st beta was jumping/air movement was really hard to contest
[0:39:18] <nothuzad> JP Zaot: Dio EN Dio: Matt Mercer - your choice
[0:39:27] <Applecannon63> Hey Zato-1 eng va is Eng Jotaro
[0:39:27] <leith_aziz> @nothuzad IE Jotaro
[0:39:28] <%ChrisBardow> So its prob related to that
[0:39:29] <Ardisan_> 6P'ing your dash ins
[0:39:31] <sunnythedrunk> You can def hear the Yusuke in Zato's Voice which is pretty funny
[0:39:48] <leith_aziz> Basically, you prefer Jotaro? Dub. Dio? Sub
[0:39:59] <+Shishi1205> Nago's 6P got buffed so now you can ignore some projectiles with its invincibility like Ky's arrows
[0:40:03] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:40:07] <+Shishi1205> it looks goofy too
[0:40:09] <+ghostfaceninja_> LUL you hate to see it
[0:40:10] <%JaseAdrift> woolieYE woolieYE
[0:40:12] <+contramann> @sunnythedrunk If you play +R you can REALLY here the DIO in Zato-1/Eddie
[0:40:13] <%ggbhtg> hard knock life

[0:42:41] <%ggbhtg> KONO R CODO
[0:42:41] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> R-CODE GOT HANDS
[0:42:43] <+Shishi1205> da,m R code has hands
[0:42:43] <sunnythedrunk> R codes monkaS
[0:42:43] <VJdarkworld> rcode matchup is rough fr
[0:42:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the yellow bar of despair
[0:42:45] <Yenwai> so from what i saw im "GUESSING" that a samsho character uses short and harsh combos as well as some reliance on reads?
[0:42:50] <%Wool> Time to gatekeep Woolie out of heaven
[0:42:52] <leith_aziz> R-code is still long if you check it. Not as long as before, but still long
[0:42:53] <MagumaDono> watch out for Making Obama
[0:42:53] <%Brightstreak> I'd like to make it to floor 5 🤣
[0:42:54] <RobocopSanchez> made it to 10 this morning that was rad
[0:42:55] <OkamiDude15> R code is a 10-0 match up
[0:42:56] <+o_almighty_1> Fight me Woolie
[0:42:58] <MagumaDono> Majin*
[0:42:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Like I legit can never think of a time when giving up life bar has been worth it
[0:42:59] <Sulliman34> @Applecannon63 interesting! im a bit surprised. i know for me personally they seemed a bit much
[0:43:01] <leith_aziz> Protip: Use pArks. Much better

[0:43:08] <T_Sasquatch> i stopped playing because its annoying as fuck to try to find a match, way too obnoxious
[0:43:09] <RobocopSanchez> heaven is so far away
[0:43:10] <+RealThiele> CSB rematch
[0:43:10] <sunnythedrunk> I hope Woolie runs into Octo again
[0:43:10] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus Its very doable, the Ranking update stuff is AGGRESSIVE this time around
[0:43:16] <user_naim> Lil R-Code Man
[0:43:20] <scarman125> he's trying really hard to not say Nago sucks but his heart isn't in it LUL
[0:43:20] <BackwardCap> I got ViP yesterday.
[0:43:21] <%Eaglestrike117> You can go up or down in like 1 or 2 matches
[0:43:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> man this game and sfv have some stupid loading just to get into the game
[0:43:23] <Saltmeisterr> look out for them lil bussy men
[0:43:29] <SheefEatsBeef> sunnythedrunk he just needs to fight axl LUL
[0:43:32] <%Wool> Servers are still working so it should work
[0:43:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> 1-2 BUSSY'S COMIN FOR YOU. 3-4 BETTER GET OFF THE FLOOR
[0:43:33] <+Superbro64> Do you still need to reset the game every time you rank up?
[0:43:35] <leith_aziz> It may be just me, but I feel like you level up FAST with the floors
[0:43:36] <@Menitta> [Checks R code] "That little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 years"
[0:43:38] <Solidnick18> the boss fight begins

[0:44:03] <%jepupu> Both betas I got like, to floor 6, beat the first newbie opponent, promoted right away, got my ass handed to me at floor 7 and got back to floor 6.
[0:44:07] <+Shishi1205> yeah Im in so it's not servers
[0:44:08] <T_Sasquatch> spending trime running around some shitty lobby while matches fail to initaizlize is mind numbing
[0:44:12] <DaKnightWarrior> lytOUCH
[0:44:13] <Solidnick18> monkaS
[0:44:15] <%Wool> Servers are still working so it should be fine

[0:44:24] <leith_aziz> Zato?
[0:44:26] <%gatorafan> this screens are pretty good, but hopefully they should go faster daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:44:27] <%ggbhtg> ThotNikeLis
[0:44:30] <+BettyMwwaahh> maybe the next GG will be perfect. if they get rid of the horrible lobbies
[0:44:39] <Uselesswhitenoise> well done! How dare you!
[0:44:43] <OkamiDude15> When you lose to lilbussyman you are forced to join the GFGR movement
[0:44:43] <BackwardCap> @woolieversus Does the state of the beta make you worried for the full release?
[0:44:45] <leith_aziz> @BettyMwwaahh Will there be a next GG?
[0:44:50] <%jepupu> I wonder if the lobbies will get better just by player count dropping to a tolerable level
[0:44:52] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> All they need to do to fix the lobbies is add a soccer ball
[0:44:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Interfacing: Sucess: You did not drop your combo, felt good hitting those buttons in that order
[0:44:58] <MagumaDono> yo @menitta you gonna be playing some today too???
[0:45:01] <leith_aziz> The newest wntry is always the most important at the moment
[0:45:04] <leith_aziz> *entry
[0:45:09] <%jepupu> Which is kinda sad. I'd love GG to have millions of players
[0:45:10] <+BettyMwwaahh> @BettyMwwaahh thats an interesting question to ask
[0:45:34] <leith_aziz> @jepupu It already reached that from what I saw of "News"
[0:45:39] <+jaayro> game lil loud
[0:45:39] <andre11dr> Fixing the lobby's would be great ,but there's no way it's happening
[0:45:58] <leith_aziz> But yeah, I really hope the game does well
[0:46:02] <leith_aziz> I love GG
[0:46:03] <dandy_bones> I think player number will stay high
[0:46:04] <+coldsama> I don't mind Nagons theme is sick
[0:46:09] <DSD24> English Nago is really cool
[0:46:09] <+coldsama> Nago
[0:46:12] <leith_aziz> Rollback is also a huge plus
[0:46:13] <%jepupu> @leith_aziz Millions of players on retail release, not free beta
[0:46:16] <leith_aziz> Alongside EVO
[0:46:18] <%Eaglestrike117> "I could get used to this", I-No says
[0:46:30] <dandy_bones> A lot of non-GG fans are getting into the series because of Strive
[0:46:34] <leith_aziz> @jepupu If it reaches 1 million, thats good enough
[0:46:43] <DaCheekyOne> "You could have won if you had not lost" - Nago
[0:46:44] <%jepupu> That'd be awesome, yeah!
[0:46:48] <leith_aziz> @dandy_bones Yep. DBFZ fans are the biggest
[0:46:51] <nothuzad> GG normally sells like 100k-200k copies lifetimes so 1 mill would be amazing
[0:46:52] <Uselesswhitenoise> Strives going to be my first GG game when its out
[0:46:55] <MagumaDono> free bat
[0:47:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:47:03] <leith_aziz> They're exeprienceing better netcode for once lol
[0:47:04] <Uselesswhitenoise> Woolie lore videos actually sucked me in'
[0:47:06] <%Sparkseid> reggie...
[0:47:06] <+LandOfTheWay> batter up LUL
[0:47:07] <leith_aziz> *experiencing
[0:47:30] <dandy_bones> There’s also the big boom in Arcsys fans after DBFZ
[0:47:31] <DaKnightWarrior> Great to see so much people talking about GG. makes me so happy.
[0:47:35] <Babbott_Orion> OGI OGI
[0:47:35] <DSD24> Ougi
[0:47:41] <MagumaDono> spicy i-no!
[0:47:41] <leith_aziz> Yeah, Woolie's videos were great. Helped me know about the lore of the 1st games
[0:47:46] <Applecannon63> ŌGI
[0:47:52] <VJdarkworld> funnily enough too +R is getting a lobby overhaul
[0:47:52] <%ggbhtg> perverrrrse
[0:47:53] <BackwardCap> OUGI kizzie2Sup
[0:47:58] <leith_aziz> @DaKnightWarrior: Same. Puts a smile on my face
[0:47:59] <DSD24> Those subtitles are not even correct
[0:48:03] <user_naim> Nago’s English VA fits so well I didn’t even realise the language changed
[0:48:14] <Ardisan_> This is my first time playing Strive, I played prev GG but not much.
[0:48:17] <nothuzad> DSD24 they are from the JP script not synced to NA version
[0:48:22] <Ardisan_> Is gatling diff in this?
[0:48:26] <%jepupu> Both of them have pretty perfect VAs
[0:48:27] <+Cyoctane> Oh wow just noticed the skeleton in the reflection of his sword during the closeup
[0:48:29] <Applecannon63> @dsd24 cause its Jp Translation
[0:48:30] <DSD24> @nothuzad Oh ok that makes sense thene
[0:48:31] <dandy_bones> THERE IS NO GATLING
[0:48:36] <user_naim> @jepupu i mean yeah
[0:48:39] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_ Yes. Links from specific buttons are a bigger foucs
[0:48:44] <DSD24> @nothuzad @Applecannon63 Thanks for clarifying!
[0:48:55] <Ardisan_> @leith_aziz Oh cool. I guess its different for the cast
[0:48:57] <professorbadvibes> wait is this an open beta?
[0:48:58] <nothuzad> no worries VoHiYo  DSD24
[0:48:58] <+RealThiele> fearing things not coming out like skill
[0:49:00] <+MauriceFaurron> yeh VA is good, Sol took some time to adjust to but it's really great
[0:49:09] <nothuzad> yes it is open beta on playstation professorbadvibes
[0:49:13] <DSD24> Damn
[0:49:14] <leith_aziz> @Ardisan_ For example, Sol has a button that links from any prev button (6S). you connect combos by using that
[0:49:18] <professorbadvibes> ty
[0:49:19] <DSD24> Nago was so intense there
[0:49:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Popped BG, Instantly lost
[0:49:25] <Saltmeisterr> that line is great
[0:49:27] <ECRead> GET AWAY FROM ME LUL
[0:49:27] <nothuzad> NA Sol is just more angry
[0:49:30] <dandy_bones> Sol’s VA is a bit too raspy for my taste
[0:49:38] <Saltmeisterr> GET AWAY FROM ME
[0:49:48] <%drefizz> Its hard to top JP Sol's VA
[0:49:55] <Saltmeisterr> ^
[0:49:56] <%drefizz> he fits Sol to a T
[0:49:58] <NotHereToStream> fuck, i just reached floor eleven
[0:49:59] <DSD24> That's such a good line
[0:49:59] <leith_aziz> I could not find myself liking Sol's ENG voice. It just pissed me off, and considering its the protag, you're gonna hear him a lot in Story
[0:49:59] <puluxor> I kinda like Solid Sol
[0:50:08] <%jepupu> I've fought against Anji only once and I hate him already
[0:50:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie is out playing Reggie and lossing due to his own mechanic
[0:50:09] <FullMetalSnorlax> @dandy_bones you should have heard his Xrd voice
[0:50:19] <MagumaDono> Ooooo that ino color tho
[0:50:19] <Applecannon63> Sean chiplock also known as Revali voicing Ky kyske is a perfect fit
[0:50:20] <DSD24> That Ino color is cute
[0:50:21] <SheefEatsBeef> lmao
[0:50:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:50:23] <$Noponis> god the blood shit is so bad now
[0:50:24] <user_naim> nice
[0:50:26] <leith_aziz> But its already hard enough to top JP Sol, im aware
[0:50:29] <+MauriceFaurron> Yeah Anji is kinda nutty
[0:50:37] <DSD24> Ky's also Rean Schwarzer from Trails of Cold Steel
[0:50:38] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 He sounds great from what I saw
[0:50:39] <23rald> LUL
[0:50:44] <Ardisan_> Sol voice is okay. Honestly the only lesser voice here.
[0:50:48] <nothuzad> JP GG voice actors are mostly just the cream of the crop
[0:50:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[0:50:52] <Applecannon63> Blood isn't that bad cause the grab drains it faster
[0:50:53] <VJdarkworld> ayumioAngy *guitar noises*
[0:50:58] <andre11dr> @drefizz His really good, but i still miss when Daisuke was voicing him because it's fucking Daisuke
[0:51:00] <nothuzad> so its really hard to compete
[0:51:12] <SheefEatsBeef> so how come sometimes nago's super doesn't do the thing? is it based on range?
[0:51:12] <dandy_bones> Strive is above Genshin Impact in terms of stream viewership right now
[0:51:14] <leith_aziz> true enough
[0:51:22] <leith_aziz> @dandy_bones WHOA. Cool
[0:51:33] <Saltmeisterr> sick
[0:51:35] <+deadDinozor> LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
[0:51:39] <$Noponis> starting to believe woolie forgot how to burst
[0:51:39] <ECRead> I'd like Pot's voice lowered one key, but I think the performance is great
[0:51:45] <$Noponis> nvm
[0:51:52] <ElDragon_1> Blood int that bad. Just need to command grab more
[0:51:53] <dandy_bones> It’s good to see GG getting the recognition it deserves
[0:51:56] <+Shirk_Diggler> They're looking intense rn lol
[0:52:04] <gunstars20> LUL

[0:52:36] <+LandOfTheWay> stroking the big tree does usually lead to a blow up, yeah
[0:52:52] <+Cyoctane> Loving this I-No color
[0:52:57] <nothuzad> dont let her stroke the big tree :)
[0:52:59] <overkrustice> I can't wait to main May
[0:53:10] <+paladinstarbuster> in glad nago seems useable now
[0:53:13] <%SirGO0SE> hey guys, how have the general improvements been for this patch? lobby etc.
[0:53:16] <%CalderGaming> @ECRead most of it is ok but the line read for Heavenly Potemkin Buster is so, so flat
[0:53:17] <DSD24> Nago sounds like someone from Asura's Wrath
[0:53:20] <leith_aziz> Also listened to ENG Giovanna. She sounded great. Really liked the chill attitude

[0:53:35] <Applecannon63> the bite is doing so well for Nago's Gameplan
[0:53:38] <user_naim> @leith_aziz ooh i haven’t heard her yet
[0:53:40] <andre11dr> Does I-No have the best move names? If not she should at least be top 3
[0:53:40] <Uselesswhitenoise> From people who have played, hows Faust?
[0:53:46] <leith_aziz> @SirGO0SE There's rematch now, but otherwise, I still find it bad
[0:53:55] <+FuqBoiSlim> lobby is still ass apparently. there's a rematch button now tho
[0:53:58] <leith_aziz> @Uselesswhitenoise He seems ok. He got some item buffs
[0:54:05] <%SirGO0SE> eh, thats an improvement at least
[0:54:15] <@Menitta> still not great but definite improvement
[0:54:22] <dandy_bones> Slayer’s got the best move names @andre11dr
[0:54:25] <andre11dr> @uselesswhitenoise Ive only played against him and his fucking weird
[0:54:26] <leith_aziz> Best thing about remtach is that you WONT need to use the lobbies
[0:54:27] <SheefEatsBeef> lobby isn't that bad just sometimes it;s unclear whether or not someone is connecting to you
[0:54:33] <bruuzer12> maximum of 3 rematches though
[0:54:33] <MagumaDono> rematch option is honestly the best thing so far
[0:54:37] <Uselesswhitenoise> sounds good
[0:54:40] <wisconsinjoe> rematch fixes a lot of the problems but getting a match in the first place is still finicky
[0:54:44] <Uselesswhitenoise> I can't wait till the game hits the pc
[0:54:45] <%alexisofthestars> For a bit I thought I-No´s English VO was the same actress as Eliza from Skullgirls.  Apparently is not.
[0:54:49] <leith_aziz> @SheefEatsBeef its just very buggy. Not saying its automaticaly bad
[0:54:50] <nothuzad> well for ranked - rematching is unlimited in free lobbies
[0:54:53] <MagumaDono> it's also infinite rematches when not in ranked
[0:54:58] <$razielhex> DREAM CANCELLED
[0:55:04] <nothuzad> Servers are also being bombarded right now - thsi is a stress test after all

[0:57:31] <T_Sasquatch> i honestly have no idea what to do defensively as nago when someone is rushing your ass down
[0:57:33] <%CptnCampy61> Somebody deserves a reward for Nago’s animations
[0:57:45] <DaCheekyOne> Anyone up for a cheeky nandos?

[0:58:31] <Picia000123> Reggie strugglin'
[0:58:32] <Blank9> anji just has too many options he's so smooth to play
[0:58:32] <dandy_bones> Zato’s animations are the reason I’m maining him
[0:58:36] <%fetrigon> literally stop pressing buttons when nago is in bloodlust or whatever it's called
[0:58:36] <DedlokPM> @Ardisan_ yes and he is using a "british accent". Not Perfect, because at times he prioritized character over accent, but he put effort into it, studying Idris Elba and the streamer Strippin.
[0:58:38] <dandy_bones> Plus he’s hot
[0:58:49] <Asuterisuku> Still mad about no PC beta.
[0:58:56] <andre11dr> Anji and Zato have the best animations ,there's no questioning it
[0:59:01] <DaKnightWarrior> @dandy_bones Zato's animations are godly.
[0:59:02] <BreakersAweigh> i'm so proud of octopimp man
[0:59:04] <BreakersAweigh> good for him
[0:59:05] <DSD24> I like this song

[0:59:15] <%fetrigon> mmmm
[0:59:18] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:59:19] <Pookiedaexzile> I get the VA backstory, and I love seeing people work, but Axel is just a bad accent
[0:59:22] <%fetrigon> eh
[0:59:25] <+paladinstarbuster> cheeky nandos
[0:59:27] <Pookiedaexzile> its cool
[0:59:27] <+contramann> Nothing like abusing your time powers to get food
[0:59:30] <nothuzad> sony paying for it probably Asuterisuku  - data mining is about as "easy" to do as it is on pc
[0:59:30] <leith_aziz> Do the time super please
[0:59:35] <Picia000123> with Axl you wanna mash 2k
[0:59:35] <%drefizz> His british accent is....passable LUL
[0:59:36] <mephium> so how is octo's VA
[0:59:37] <GilliamYaeger> STAY DOWN MOITE
[0:59:51] <dandy_bones> So I guess Axl has full control of his powers now
[0:59:55] <WakeUpThrow> Sounds a bit 'straian to me
[0:59:56] <DSD24> So it looks like Nago just kills people with damage
[0:59:57] <overkrustice> Yeah this Axel is literally the worst,    I would switch off dub instantly.
[1:00:02] <Picia000123> Axl doesn't have a JAB jab
[1:00:05] <%deadDinozor> how easy is it to just pick this game up and start playing?
[1:00:08] <overkrustice> No hate on Octo though
[1:00:11] <+contramann> @dandy_bones I-No helped him out with that in the last game
[1:00:12] <leith_aziz> @dandy_bones seems so
[1:00:16] <+glgzephyr> on the other hand, Matt Mercer as ZATO-1.
[1:00:20] <%deadDinozor> deadDinozor is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[1:00:22] <%deadDinozor> deadDinozor gifted a Tier 1 sub to Josef_Stryker! 
[1:00:27] <overkrustice> @deadDinozor As easy as pay $60
[1:00:40] <%fetrigon> hopefully they redo this and the VA and voice director more time.

[1:00:56] <DSD24> Wakeup super!
[1:00:57] <leith_aziz> @fetrigon You mean re-dub? Is that a thing?
[1:00:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Axel sounds like Pats impression of Clemps
[1:01:03] <+glgzephyr> @deadDinozor It's not out, no one knows yet.
[1:01:11] <BreakersAweigh> @fetrigon not usually
[1:01:13] <DSD24> Its wakeup super not honorable?
[1:01:17] <andre11dr> That's the thing with Nago, he has to use that super because it's his only reversal, it's safe tho
[1:01:24] <$razielhex> the damage is so intense
[1:01:30] <+glgzephyr> @DSD24 Fuck honor.
[1:01:37] <dandy_bones> I’m hyped for the story trailer we’re getting soon
[1:01:41] <leith_aziz> @glgzephyr Honor died on the beach
[1:01:42] <TheVoltStrike> dishonorable gameplay!?
[1:01:44] <%jepupu> Are the wakeup reversal supers frame 0 invincible in these? Sometimes they feel difficult to pull off.
[1:01:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand Dead due to blood gaug

[1:02:05] <deviljhojho_> Worf look on in shame

[1:02:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't
[1:02:22] <UnfilteredComic> Life Leads are dishonorable
[1:02:26] <%fetrigon> @leith_aziz @breakersaweigh I hope so. These could be done better.
[1:02:27] <Uselesswhitenoise> im very honorable
[1:02:29] <+glgzephyr> blocking is dishonorable
[1:02:29] <+contramann> If I throw my hooks like this and you run into it... it'll be your fault

[1:02:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Blood Gauge is full of Honor
[1:02:51] <leith_aziz> Nago against Axl sounds like a terrible matchup
[1:02:51] <%jepupu> That was too oisy!
[1:02:51] <Nikbottom> the blood thurst is ral

[1:03:04] <JayEarly> I haven’t heard Chip’s theme in 6+ hours playing this beta
[1:03:05] <$razielhex> how ambivalent are those background people?  goddmn
[1:03:15] <DSD24> This is Tuesday for them
[1:03:19] <%jepupu> Everyone's too afraid to use Chipp
[1:03:20] <Pookiedaexzile> This is ghte guilty gear universe, this is normal
[1:03:24] <leith_aziz> @razielhex Eh, not the first time things like this happen
[1:03:27] <+contramann> @razielhex The Bear in the other part of the stage goes nuts when the round ends th
[1:03:29] <Dave_VD> He's just a worse spacer in that state
[1:03:32] <$razielhex> Oooh, it's an M. Bison thing.
[1:03:33] <+Jorm_Plays> hold on how is woolie jumping so far with nagoriyuki?
[1:03:37] <+FuqBoiSlim> This is just the average afternoon in New York
[1:03:38] <mephium> his grab got rollbacked Kappa
[1:03:40] <DSD24> Does Chipp still have low health?
[1:03:43] <SpawnConnery> @Jorm_Plays super jump
[1:03:47] <UnfilteredComic> super jump, down up
[1:03:50] <+Mrbaconator> @jepupu i saw steeb playin some chipp to some success
[1:03:54] <leith_aziz> @DSD24 Yep. Though he doesnt seem to die as fast it seems
[1:03:59] <Dave_VD> @Jorm_Plays Probably super jump
[1:04:02] <$razielhex> for Axl, this is the most important day of his life; for the people of Dr. Seresei's New Times Sqwuare Street Station, it's only Tuesday.
[1:04:10] <leith_aziz> I played Chipp this beta. Same with Mustard. He's good
[1:04:19] <+Jorm_Plays> @spawnconnery haven't figured out that yet now i gotta lab
[1:04:20] <+contramann> @DSD24 They lowered the Damage supposedly, so that makes sense
[1:04:26] <DSD24> I'm glad he's good at least!
[1:04:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Blood guage is legit killing him more than reggie
[1:04:39] <andre11dr> Yeah if there's two caracters that i never see is Chip and Milia maybe that's just me
[1:04:43] <SpawnConnery> @Jorm_Plays it's just pressing down before you jump my man,you'll get it no prob
[1:04:48] <%jepupu> How the hell do you get close enough to Axl to bite him anyway?
[1:04:50] <+glgzephyr> @Pookiedaexzile That is Nago in a nutshell
[1:04:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:04:52] <scrublord009> Someone needs to command grab more
[1:04:56] <leith_aziz> Millia's good. People dont play her much, thats just it
[1:05:02] <+contramann> I've seen more Millia's than Chips
[1:05:07] <+ALazo> Oh god I just realized it's in english
[1:05:07] <Applecannon63> Blood gauge is only killing him cause of constantly using his blood moves alot
[1:05:08] <Dave_VD> @jepupu In the current state of the game, you don't
[1:05:11] <leith_aziz> I see more Chipp than Millia
[1:05:12] <deviljhojho_> oi bruv innit
[1:05:13] <JayEarly> I’ve seen millia not a single chipp or axl
[1:05:14] <+Checktrap> That's my mans
[1:05:14] <+glgzephyr> I beat a Millia today by using literally just Megafist LUL
[1:05:19] <+Jorm_Plays> @spawnconnery thanks for the tip idk how i never found that out
[1:05:20] <Spirit_NB> I can't tell if Chipp is super fun, or the game is super fun and I need to try more characters
[1:05:22] <leith_aziz> EU at least
[1:05:27] <Pookiedaexzile> "having" to grab instead of having a grab people should fear is the line between bad and good in grapplers
[1:05:27] <overkrustice> @ALazo now you too can suffer
[1:05:30] <%jepupu> I've seen some EU Axls
[1:05:33] <Blank9> I've seen some chipp, but not axl or milla
[1:05:35] <+contramann> I beat a Millia by just poking her to death
[1:05:36] <%Josef_Stryker> @Spirit_NB Yes
[1:05:42] <DaKnightWarrior> Still haven't seen an Axl.
[1:05:51] <leith_aziz> I've only seen ONE Axl in EU. Same with last beta
[1:05:52] <dandy_bones> I’ve fought two Axls
[1:05:53] <user_naim> @pookiedaexzile wisdom
[1:05:56] <+contramann> @scrublord009 There's your command grabs
[1:06:06] <+FuqBoiSlim> @pookiedaexzile that's real asf
[1:06:09] <Ardisan_> I'm too scared to go online
[1:06:25] <andre11dr> The characters i fight the most are definitely Gio,Ram,Ky and Pot
[1:06:31] <dandy_bones> I do really like the change to throws in this game
[1:06:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> pressin buttons LUL
[1:06:32] <%jepupu> Maybe I should learn Zato this time around. Back in the day I didn't want to use him because he was too high tier
[1:06:34] <%Irridium> LUL
[1:06:37] <%Jetzord> Rip Octo
[1:06:40] <TheVoltStrike> VERY GOOD MAHJONG
[1:06:46] <MagumaDono> stop mashing Reggie :)
[1:06:46] <+contramann> @Ardisan_ Just go online and hit some buttons man
[1:06:56] <DSD24> I wonder how Ram in English sounds
[1:06:58] <JayEarly> The only thing I’ve been able to abuse as Ky is the knockdown, charged stun edge oki but I don’t know if it’s real or if it just works on the opponents I’m facing
[1:07:06] <deviljhojho_> she has a cockney accent
[1:07:07] <+glgzephyr> @jepupu Characters being good is a poor reason to not use them. If you like a character, play them.
[1:07:11] <%Irridium> oh that's right with the english dub we can understand Ram's long-ass taunt
[1:07:12] <leith_aziz> Most people I've fought in EU are Sol, I-No, Giovanna and Anji
[1:07:16] <DaKnightWarrior> @ardisan_ It get's easier the more you do it. unless if it's smash though.
[1:07:18] <Applecannon63> Ram's va is honestly good
[1:07:19] <leith_aziz> Plus Ky
[1:07:21] <Ardisan_> @contramann I need to learn systems and characters
[1:07:26] <DSD24> Nago has his Riceball speech too
[1:07:28] <Dave_VD> @Ardisan_ Don't be. Otherwise you'll never truly get good
[1:07:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @DSD24 better than sign, new voice fits her more
[1:07:32] <+LandOfTheWay> funniest thing i've seen so far is someone win a round as sol by literally just landing two raw supers and a jab
[1:07:35] <overkrustice> @Applecannon63 Agreed, Rams japanese Va is great
[1:07:43] <+contramann> @Ardisan_ Nah I started playing and I used RC maybe twice before today
[1:07:48] <%jepupu> @glgzephyr I know, I know. It's a minor thing for me, but still affects my choices. Plus I like to pick a bit more obscure characters that others don't know how to play against
[1:07:49] <DSD24> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ That's good to hear
[1:07:50] <JayEarly> Ram’s English VA is a MASSIVE improvement over Sign
[1:07:56] <+contramann> *Started playing since Beta start
[1:08:06] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 I dont find it bad or anything, but Ram seems to emote way too much considering last game. She is emoting more in general in this game, but I feel ENG went overboard
[1:08:20] <leith_aziz> But its probably still better than Sign I hear
[1:08:22] <Picia000123> the struggle
[1:08:29] <andre11dr> Yeah Sign Ram VA was like emotionless anime voice number 3
[1:08:30] <+contramann> @Ardisan_ Also the rankings are going away after the Beta is done anyway, so it's fine if you lose alot
[1:08:38] <Yenwai> will there be a time to ask questions later in the stream? towards the end perhaps?
[1:08:41] <DaCheekyOne> avin a looff
[1:08:45] <Applecannon63> I mean reason why she emotes more because story
[1:08:45] <+contramann> Reseting going away I mean
[1:08:52] <jahsmittsii> I just need to learn RC then I shall ascend to greatness
[1:08:52] <leith_aziz> @Yenwai With Woolie? Usually, yes
[1:08:58] <Yenwai> ah ok
[1:08:58] <PFlare> Yeah, I mean, it makes sense that Ram is emoting more to me.
[1:09:01] <JayEarly> the problem with dub Ram in Sign is that she speaks like a text to speech program
[1:09:02] <DedlokPM> 'avin' a laff!
[1:09:17] <DaKnightWarrior> On your bike mate.
[1:09:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Nago so honorable he has a Comeback mechanic for his opponent if he's doing too well
[1:09:21] <+contramann> @jahsmittsii Tip for greatness, RC before you hit and Grab them
[1:09:27] <+glgzephyr> Sub Ram is also a machine in Strive. Dub Ram is the only one with personality
[1:09:40] <PFlare> I've been liking the dub so far in Strive, being honest.
[1:09:44] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 Yeah, thats what I meant. I just feel like its a bit too much difference. Im speaking from what they seem to lean on in JP version.
[1:09:52] <andre11dr> Nago probably has my favorite dub voice, he sounds really cool
[1:10:00] <PFlare> But I've never been super about the 'purity' of subs and whatnot anywho, so I'm biased.
[1:10:01] <DSD24> I just like being able to hear battle dialogue
[1:10:12] <Saltmeisterr> ^
[1:10:13] <jahsmittsii> @contramann I’m taking notes
[1:10:19] <PFlare> Same. I like to understand what people are saying naturally.
[1:10:26] <JayEarly> I even like dub Sol which I know a lot of people don’t but he sounds like the pissed off grandpa he is
[1:10:39] <Serge_12> @WoolieVersus fix your camera
[1:10:44] <primaryfire> pot in the dub sounds way more like a dude and less like a hulk unfortunately
[1:10:44] <Pookiedaexzile> No one tell him
[1:10:48] <+contramann> @jahsmittsii You can RC aftere doing a Super if you know it'll whiff and/or get blocked
[1:10:52] <Ardisan_> I love Axl's voice
[1:10:56] <Darkred28> Woolie looks ready to rumble
[1:11:00] <+contramann> then you do some dirty mixup
[1:11:02] <DSD24> Plus most games don't subtitle battle dialogue so its always a struggle
[1:11:02] <+glgzephyr> Dub Sol honestly sounds like a villain
[1:11:06] <semachie> Reggie LUL
[1:11:07] <DaKnightWarrior> Reggie NEEDS TO ROCK!
[1:11:13] <Darkred28> SourPls
[1:11:16] <+contramann> @glgzephyr Well he is a badguy
[1:11:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah I get you
[1:11:19] <leith_aziz> I have nothing against people using Dub. Nothing "wrong" about it. Pick what you like more
[1:11:20] <PFlare> Dub Pot honestly sounds good to me.
[1:11:22] <ElPlasa> GAMBLING'S ONLY FOR FOOLS
[1:11:25] <andre11dr> I mean Sol is supposed to a little of an antihero
[1:11:30] <DasFreekman> god i bet axls voice actor is some shit posting meme lord octoDab
[1:11:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Its cool, The camera still shows the struggle
[1:11:33] <Serge_12> yall see that empty space under woolies camera chat?
[1:11:34] <Applecannon63> Ky's dub is litterally reference  the GGX "I'm Falling" Dub
[1:11:36] <Pookiedaexzile> and thats what's really important
[1:11:36] <%slayabee> Every dub voice is gold to me
[1:11:36] <DSD24> Sol has his cool Robot Wife
[1:11:41] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Not really by the end of Rev 2
[1:11:46] <jahsmittsii> @contramann REALLY??!!!! THAT WOULD’VE SAVED ME SO MANY TIMES
[1:11:47] <JayEarly> Dub Pot nails HEAVENLY POTEMKIN BUSTAH and that’s what really matters

[1:12:15] <overkrustice> understandable
[1:12:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Nago needs more ways to get blood back
[1:12:41] <+Mrbaconator> AVIN A LAUGH
[1:12:48] <Pookiedaexzile> or every move he lands clean during blood rage needs to give health back
[1:12:51] <%drefizz> Sol's voice is off to me in english and I-No's is pushing it a bit with the amount of moaning she does but other than that, its not bad
[1:12:55] <+glgzephyr> @Pookiedaexzile He has a command grab that erases the bar and all of his normals give blood back. What else is left?
[1:12:57] <+contramann> @jahsmittsii I like to RC Sol's fake DI and just DP their jump
[1:13:00] <Picia000123> REGGIE WTF
[1:13:05] <Applecannon63> maybe make his grab charge towards the opponent
[1:13:10] <andre11dr> Oh fuck, i really hope they don't bring Sin into this, talk about a caracter that i love everything about but hate fighting against him with all my hart
[1:13:15] <leith_aziz> speaking of dubs, if I ever watched Dragon Ball, I would use Dub, but man the shit with Funimation turns me off...
[1:13:19] <DSD24> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[1:13:26] <Blank9> I just want venom
[1:13:29] <Serge_12> @WoolieVersus you have some empty space under your facecam
[1:13:29] <+glgzephyr> @andre11dr Welcome to Guilty Gear, the ride is forever
[1:13:50] <+contramann> @jahsmittsii Also if you're playing Ram you can RC her Beam super and it'll still happen while you can move
[1:13:51] <JayEarly> the only thing about Nago is him losing his specials feels too harsh with the insane health loss
[1:13:52] <leith_aziz> Zato!
[1:13:58] <jahsmittsii> @contramann I’m a Gio main but this is valuable info same way
[1:14:01] <leith_aziz> Wanna hear Matt Mercer
[1:14:03] <overkrustice> Can you switch language mid fight?
[1:14:04] <WakeUpThrow> Can you break the wall by entering blood rage? I wonder if that can make it safe or such
[1:14:04] <+superpapaigamer> who is winning?
[1:14:07] <scarman125> the shit Funimation did to the voice actor of Broly was fucking gross
[1:14:10] <Saltmeisterr> LEO THO?
[1:14:18] <Serge_12> thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB
[1:14:18] <EnderGamma> Defaults are pretty strong
[1:14:19] <Saltmeisterr> @scarman125 Wait what happened?
[1:14:21] <Asuterisuku> I like how it shows you the range a character is strongest at.
[1:14:21] <DSD24> I like Goldmask Nago
[1:14:22] <leith_aziz> @WakeUpThrow Doesnt seem to work. Maybe in last hit?
[1:14:24] <PFlare> Also Woolie's the only guy playing in English, so.
[1:14:26] <Pookiedaexzile> @glgzephyr I can't @ the dude, but literally replace the blood back with health back
[1:14:28] <andre11dr> I'd genuinely rather have Testament back before Sin ,his range and damage is just so insane
[1:14:29] <Nikbottom> defaults are all nice
[1:14:32] <Darkred28> SOCIETY
[1:14:32] <deviljhojho_> did someone say society
[1:14:36] <Applecannon63> the Vic situation…
[1:14:36] <leith_aziz> @PFlare Mustard also plays Dub
[1:14:42] <DSD24> Heart
[1:14:44] <deviljhojho_> reggie chooses violence
[1:14:48] <+glgzephyr> @Pookiedaexzile FUUUUUCK no lmao
[1:14:50] <%kyh9> OY
[1:14:50] <Bunyanator> I play Axl
[1:14:50] <NotHereToStream> m8
[1:14:52] <+KilogramHours> OI OI OI AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE
[1:14:53] <+Mrbaconator> i can't not hear the fart noise cuz of that tweet LUL
[1:14:55] <deviljhojho_> luv
[1:14:58] <%LastHazzerd> pip pip cherio
[1:15:02] <%kyh9> Doesnt seem like there are custom intros or exits
[1:15:17] <MidnightPacif1c> octoNa octoNi
[1:15:21] <leith_aziz> @kyh9 There are unique dialog between specific chaaracters
[1:15:27] <WakeUpThrow> @leith_aziz Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Sounds tough to pull off, but I wonder
[1:15:29] <g0d_zill4> @andre11dr Agreed, it's been too long since Testament has made an appearance. He's one of the most powerful characters in lore too so it's only fitting he returns now
[1:15:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @kyh9 they're there, but the pool of character combinations is pretty small
[1:15:34] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ
[1:15:51] <DSD24> THat's bullshit blazing!
[1:16:04] <Saltmeisterr> i know nago and sol has a unique one
[1:16:36] <+breakersnap> NOITY NOIT
[1:16:40] <Applecannon63> Maybe they could add unique reaction/expressions in there dialogue like in Granblue Vs
[1:16:45] <g0d_zill4> Is Nago's blood burst safe on block?
[1:16:45] <PFlare> Axl's voice is fun.
[1:16:45] <$Noponis> GOD BLESS OCTOPIMP
[1:16:51] <leith_aziz> Leo has one with Gio. Same with Ram
[1:17:04] <c_5g> Axl gives me beast boy vibes but bri'ish
[1:17:08] <Supabait> PogChamp
[1:17:10] <+contramann> @jahsmittsii But yeah a good RC can continue a combo or you can abuse it to do some realy dirty moves
[1:17:12] <deviljhojho_> that "oh"
[1:17:17] <Cavumentum> Captain Britain vs The Black Samurai
[1:17:17] <GUDDAY12> just curious who voices gio?
[1:17:19] <+Superbro64> Octopimp sounds *mad* like a jobber yugioh villain for a filler arc, which I guess is COMPLETELY on brand for Octopimp
[1:17:21] <PFlare> That COMEBACK
[1:17:22] <+Superbro64> Goods stuff
[1:17:23] <%ThisIsLloyd> octoKnife noice
[1:17:26] <leith_aziz> Millia also has unique dialouge with Zato and Leo
[1:17:26] <Saltmeisterr> @GUDDAY12 Lilimar
[1:17:31] <Shardlab> That was a real good fight
[1:17:33] <%LastHazzerd> my loif slashed befor me eyes
[1:17:41] <nothuzad> well GG has now a fairly big backlog of characters to "return" but also based on the story we might also get to see some more new fighters (but old faces)
[1:17:43] <Picia000123> Reggie plays way too scared against Nago
[1:17:48] <overkrustice> Is the lipsync atleast getting fixed?
[1:17:48] <andre11dr> One caracter that i only seem to care and want back is Raven, easily one of the cooler Rev new comers, also his play style is really fun
[1:17:57] <jahsmittsii> @contramann going back to the tower to abuse my new knowledge
[1:18:01] <leith_aziz> @nothuzad Asuka could be playable now, which would be cool
[1:18:03] <Saltmeisterr> i hope bedman returns in some form :(
[1:18:09] <Supabait> woolie jumping over those normals at the end of that round there, his mind was literally already in the future
[1:18:10] <leith_aziz> @Saltmeisterr His sister might
[1:18:17] <andre11dr> Also story wise Revan is awesome
[1:18:18] <ElPlasa> @overkrustice Lipsinc isn't even in japanese in 3d acrsys games
[1:18:18] <jahsmittsii> @contramann thank you so much
[1:18:28] <Saltmeisterr> @Saltmeisterr that would cool ye
[1:18:31] <mothdude> Put in Aria with Justice's moveset plz
[1:18:33] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Raven? He's already playable
[1:18:39] <nothuzad> asuka, bedmans sister or arielis are all very possible picks @leith_aziz
[1:18:50] <Uselesswhitenoise> I hope every character every in a GG game returns, no matter how little it makes sense
[1:18:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Same
[1:18:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[1:18:59] <PFlare> ROFL
[1:18:59] <DaKnightWarrior> zyzxLmao
[1:18:59] <NotHereToStream> LUL

[1:19:01] <ElPlasa> HOLY CHIP
[1:19:01] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[1:19:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:19:05] <leith_aziz> Yeah, I'd like to see Aria playable considering how much shit she was inolved in the Story
[1:19:08] <nothuzad> Uselesswhitenoise well DAisuke said he wants everybody back fi the game is successfull enough to garuantee it
[1:19:09] <Applecannon63> The only way they add Aria as playable if she becomes another Valentine
[1:19:10] <g0d_zill4> unga bunga
[1:19:13] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz I mean in this one Ive played him in Rev
[1:19:16] <APimpNamedSlickTrunks> All that buildup man....
[1:19:19] <Supabait> bring back justice as a real character
[1:19:27] <andre11dr> Unless you're talking about some story shit
[1:19:29] <+gg_aleph> @Applecannon63 Justice armor
[1:19:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Bring Back Zappa animations
[1:19:40] <andre11dr> I haven't finished the rev 2 story
[1:19:40] <PFlare> I did NOT like Bedman. Glad he's dead.
[1:19:47] <Supabait> Zato-1: broke Eddie: REAL SHIT
[1:19:51] <DaKnightWarrior> Zappa would be crazy.
[1:19:52] <Uselesswhitenoise> Timelines get messed up and good guy justice shows up to fight evil Sol
[1:19:56] <PFlare> ...whoop. The timing of that.
[1:19:56] <BreakersAweigh> SourPls
[1:19:57] <Ardisan_> Is axl and Ino Reggie's characters
[1:19:59] <TheVoltStrike> bedman's gameplay was dope tho
[1:19:59] <+gg_aleph> @PFlare no one likes that character
[1:19:59] <leith_aziz> I mean, I can see Aria maybe play like a scientist with some tech
[1:20:00] <Saltmeisterr> i liked the bedmun :)
[1:20:04] <iacus_> very genjuro, that super
[1:20:05] <WakeUpThrow> I just want my boy Kliff back man
[1:20:06] <fazril6333> dr paradigm
[1:20:09] <%averyoddjew> wait they added an english dub?
[1:20:13] <leith_aziz> Yep
[1:20:14] <PFlare> Yup.
[1:20:14] <APimpNamedSlickTrunks> what are those weapons called again?
[1:20:16] <%drefizz> LUL
[1:20:16] <+gg_aleph> @Saltmeisterr lies!
[1:20:19] <Darkred28> He put his helmet back on to take it back off
[1:20:20] <%LastHazzerd> yeah i'm "beat"
[1:20:26] <perfect_disaster> i love that mask
[1:20:27] <+R0kushi> I'd love venom to come back
[1:20:28] <DasFreekman> octoMan
[1:20:29] <DSD24> Motivational Speaker Nago
[1:20:30] <PFlare> @APimpNamedSlickTrunks Axl's?
[1:20:32] <overkrustice> Lets hear may
[1:20:34] <jorniev> is nago good now?
[1:20:36] <DSD24> Yeah its Milla time
[1:20:37] <nothuzad> we all know everybody wants leopaldon PogChamp
[1:20:41] <Uselesswhitenoise> hair wife
[1:20:42] <APimpNamedSlickTrunks> yeah @pflare
[1:20:43] <Darkred28> MILLIA MAINS RISE UP
[1:20:44] <Supabait> the gold hemlet looks good on nago
[1:20:46] <lostcolors> Axl's weapon is a kusarigama
[1:20:49] <PFlare> @APimpNamedSlickTrunks Kusarigama
[1:20:52] <Saltmeisterr> @Saltmeisterr its mostly cuz he fits with my playstyle, same with venom
[1:20:54] <DaKnightWarrior> I just want Justice.
[1:20:55] <%LastHazzerd> blue and gold, noble
[1:20:58] <APimpNamedSlickTrunks> thanks I forgot
[1:20:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Bring back Bridget Legitimately,  I wanna see which way they go on the design
[1:21:00] <Applecannon63> Chain and Sickle
[1:21:01] <DSD24> Yoooo this Nago color is sick
[1:21:06] <BreakersAweigh> god those hips
[1:21:07] <DaKnightWarrior> Justice is way too cool.
[1:21:08] <BreakersAweigh> what the heck
[1:21:09] <user_naim> So we’re doing Nago vs The World Warrios
[1:21:14] <DSD24> I like tan Milla
[1:21:22] <ECRead> how does Millia get hotter every game?
[1:21:26] <JayEarly> Bridget is like the most wanted character in Japan iirc
[1:21:29] <Pookiedaexzile> THis is a great Nago color, but if he was a different dude
[1:21:31] <+breakersnap> is Jack in Strive?
[1:21:32] <Iwashi94> who's Nagoriyuki's VA? HE sounds familiar
[1:21:33] <PFlare> Decent voice for Milla.
[1:21:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Like a ship captain
[1:21:44] <%drefizz> @Iwashi94 Our dad
[1:21:47] <Applecannon63> Tara Platt?
[1:21:48] <andre11dr> If they make Aria playable, then she should have Justice as an install
[1:21:49] <PFlare> She's supposed to be English, right?
[1:21:51] <overkrustice> I think nago may be the only decent voice so far
[1:21:58] <DedlokPM> @Iwashi94 Evan Michael Lee
[1:21:59] <Supabait> I want Justice and Slayer to come back...
[1:22:06] <%CalderGaming> Nago's is a fairly new VA
[1:22:11] <overkrustice> What was the freeze with milia
[1:22:15] <Saltmeisterr> @Iwashi94 Evan Michael Lee
[1:22:29] <DSD24> Yeah Millia's Tara Platt
[1:22:30] <WakeUpThrow> Was expecting a bit more russian in her voice, but I quite like it
[1:22:31] <%LastHazzerd> this might be my favorite Nago color
[1:22:40] <Supabait> blue coat and gold helm
[1:22:41] <%CalderGaming> evan michael lee could cosplay nago
[1:22:42] <Supabait> looking GOOD
[1:22:45] <PFlare> @WakeUpThrow Yeah, it's only slightly higher pitched than I personally imagined it.
[1:22:45] <Saltmeisterr> oh Millia's va is confirmed?
[1:22:48] <%drefizz> I also thought she was supposed to be Russian
[1:22:56] <andre11dr> Does anyone care about robo Ky? At least for the play style
[1:22:57] <DSD24> Damn
[1:22:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:23:02] <mothdude> C
[1:23:02] <+gg_aleph> Does Woolie play only Nago in Strive?
[1:23:04] <Pookiedaexzile> This nago color is  too good for the backstory tho, Like this dude a different person
[1:23:10] <jayw888> they gonna jump online?
[1:23:14] <Uselesswhitenoise> He really likes Nago
[1:23:15] <deviljhojho_> so this is what they were talking about when they said Punch Perm
[1:23:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> any Leo's in chat wanna fight
[1:23:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause I've only fought 1
[1:23:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> haven't seen any Faust's wither

[1:23:39] <DSD24> Isn't English Leo Sojiro from Persona 5
[1:23:45] <%kyh9> This is the best skin
[1:23:47] <Saltmeisterr> @DSD24 and Papa Nier
[1:23:48] <deviljhojho_> did leo get that huge nerf after all?
[1:23:53] <green2814> they fired broly's voice actor cause he was a child rapist
[1:23:58] <DSD24> @Saltmeisterr The best voice
[1:24:02] <+gg_aleph> @CaptainPileDriver What rank? If you're around 6 we can tango later
[1:24:03] <+breakersnap> the detail for nago's sword and sheath is so sick
[1:24:03] <nothuzad> andre11dr every GG character has their following whow ants them back - like ABA, Bridget, Kliff etc.
[1:24:04] <Ardisan_> Red best Nago skin
[1:24:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'm at like 8 right now
[1:24:17] <deviljhojho_> og skin is just perfect
[1:24:21] <leith_aziz> We not about to start debating the Broly shit till there's evidence, people
[1:24:21] <Pookiedaexzile> @green2814 Wait who?
[1:24:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> been boun omg around 8-10
[1:24:28] <jorniev> what is that weird background rattling sound?
[1:24:40] <green2814> vic migonoia
[1:24:42] <deviljhojho_> its the background sound of woolie and reggie's fighting spirits
[1:24:42] <%drefizz> Lets not even talk about it
[1:24:46] <+gg_aleph> @CaptainPileDriver If you're okay with playing against a scrub, I'm up
[1:24:49] <PFlare> Been wondering that myself. What's the rattling sound?
[1:24:49] <DasFreekman> i dont know the lore but is testament or raven story dead? any chance of either returning?
[1:24:50] <ElPlasa> SWEET BABY JESUS
[1:24:50] <g0d_zill4> I wonder who's squishier, Chipp or Millia?
[1:24:53] <mothdude> Jesus that health loss
[1:24:53] <DSD24> Now its a fair fight!
[1:24:55] <Saltmeisterr> oh vic
[1:24:57] <leith_aziz> I'd rather not jump the boat, people
[1:24:58] <sunnythedrunk> Chipp is squishier
[1:25:10] <DedlokPM> Johnny Yong Bosch is a better fit for Broly anyway
[1:25:11] <Saltmeisterr> OH SHIT
[1:25:12] <T_Sasquatch> oof
[1:25:16] <Pookiedaexzile> @g0d_zill4 Nago
[1:25:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> im gonna be playing woolie and Reggie, playing scrubs is what I do
[1:25:18] <Applecannon63> OUGI
[1:25:26] <deviljhojho_> johnny is a king regardless of role
[1:25:27] <Shardlab> @DedlokPM Definitely
[1:25:27] <%Josef_Stryker> So is Millia voiced by Tara Platt or does it just sound like her?
[1:25:29] <green2814> @dedlokpm yup
[1:25:32] <leith_aziz> its actually nice to have a chat to talk about the lore with. Thanks people
[1:25:36] <Saltmeisterr> i just noticed the reflection on nago's sword when he does then super
[1:25:37] <PFlare> @DasFreekman Testament has no reason to take part in anything anymore. His sole goal was protecting Dizzy, and she's under Ky's protection now for obvious reasons. Testament never liked people so he's fine if they all die.
[1:25:40] <Ramasama13> @DasFreekman raven is immortal and testament is just hanging out
[1:25:42] <andre11dr> I hit a Millia with Heavy Mob and i think it did half life LUL
[1:25:43] <Saltmeisterr> its that big skeleton yoki
[1:25:46] <Saltmeisterr> sick
[1:25:56] <%Josef_Stryker> Vic is a better DBZ Broly, JYB is a better DBS Broly.
[1:25:56] <mothdude> Raven just wants to live a quiet life
[1:25:57] <Saltmeisterr> Yokai*
[1:25:58] <+gg_aleph> @CaptainPileDriver add me on PSN: Col_Heidern , we can run some sets
[1:26:06] <+gg_aleph> What char you play, btw?
[1:26:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:26:07] <deviljhojho_> D I S S A P O I N T I N G
[1:26:07] <leith_aziz> Milllia sounds nice.
[1:26:14] <Quesoazul9> It's absurd we never heard from testament when Dizzy was frozen by Ky
[1:26:22] <Applecannon63> So apparently Nago knows about Chipp's master
[1:26:27] <deviljhojho_> Testament is just chilling at the bahamas
[1:26:44] <%drefizz> I wonder how old Nago is
[1:26:47] <nothuzad> yea testament has 0 reason to do anything outside of staying at his forest shelter takign care of animals
[1:26:56] <leith_aziz> I think Arcsys just might want Testament back, which why they kinda ended his involvement in any story
[1:27:04] <Quesoazul9> "My sole goal is to forever protect Dizzy, unless she is not in my immediate area, then WHO??"
[1:27:04] <leith_aziz> *might not
[1:27:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'm an anji main
[1:27:13] <%Josef_Stryker> Nago's theme is so fucking good. Easily my favourite song in the OST imo
[1:27:13] <Blank9> no one has any reason to do anything, unless they're written to do something
[1:27:27] <leith_aziz> @Josef_Stryker Society for me. But this is really good
[1:27:28] <Uselesswhitenoise> testament has a good reason, for me to play as him
[1:27:32] <%drefizz> Colors for me
[1:27:33] <andre11dr> Testament has that Akuma problem where his so OP you want him to just chil over there so we can get an actual treat
[1:27:40] <Quesoazul9> @Blank9 That's a good point xD
[1:27:45] <Darkred28> KomodoHype
[1:27:50] <nothuzad> as said Daisuke would want "everybody" back if the game si successful enough - but it first needs to get there V:
[1:27:50] <overkrustice> Nah, bullshit blazing was the trailer theme for a reason
[1:27:52] <+gg_aleph> @CaptainPileDriver That rocks because I also only played one Anji lol
[1:27:53] <Sulliman34> JESUS CHILLIA
[1:28:00] <Saltmeisterr> we got combos
[1:28:00] <ElPlasa> @Josef_Stryker It's either this one or colours for me
[1:28:05] <Uselesswhitenoise> testament slips in the shower and hits his head, that causes him to really want to get in fights with people
[1:28:07] <NotHereToStream> blood drain sucks
[1:28:09] <TheVoltStrike> this character is so painful dude
[1:28:12] <scarman125> @green2814 you clearly have no fucking clue what you're talking about
[1:28:15] <revoltingimp> that was sick Reggie!
[1:28:18] <%drefizz> Colors makes me tear cause it makes me worried about Faust's health
[1:28:19] <g0d_zill4> Well, if all of reality is threatened, Dizzy is also threatened. So, Testament could  possibly come back into action
[1:28:22] <leith_aziz> I dont see Testament being OP considering he was beaten in the 1st GG game and not really shown much otherwise
[1:28:48] <Sulliman34> i will say its kinda messed up that they made nago 214H 0 on block
[1:28:49] <leith_aziz> I really like Colors, so much character in a song. Easily Top 3
[1:28:53] <Blank9> He goes 1v1 with no-weights Potemkin in one of the drama cd's
[1:28:55] <+Checktrap> stagger pressure
[1:29:02] <leith_aziz> @Sulliman34 Yep, I mix it with Bite now
[1:29:07] <%Josef_Stryker> I think we can agree the OST in general is a banger.
[1:29:08] <@Menitta> I dont know what it's called but it's on Millia's stage
[1:29:09] <sunnythedrunk> I wonder how the Nago Pot matchup goes
[1:29:12] <+gg_aleph> I want Venom to come back! That'd be sick
[1:29:12] <@Menitta> I like that track a lot
[1:29:15] <leith_aziz> @Josef_Stryker Agreed
[1:29:15] <DaCheekyOne> Bro, that ticking sound is hella annoying
[1:29:18] <Applecannon63> @leith_aziz gamplay wise he's OP
[1:29:30] <%drefizz> ticking?
[1:29:30] <+seduwu> @leith_aziz testament is op in gameplay not story
[1:29:40] <leith_aziz> I'd love Venom to come back as a baker fiur the luls
[1:29:42] <leith_aziz> haha
[1:29:43] <$razielhex> Wait, this is "Come Together" by the Beatles
[1:29:45] <leith_aziz> *for
[1:29:46] <$razielhex> MONKEY FINGER
[1:29:47] <@Menitta> oooh nice
[1:29:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait....What if they added a bleed effect TOO THE Oppenent as well as Nago if he landed
[1:29:50] <Blank9> Venom's my favorite, I love how freeform weird angle combo he gets.
[1:29:50] <+Jack8274> nice
[1:29:51] <$razielhex> HOLY ROLLER
[1:29:54] <%Josef_Stryker> That's totally Mitsuru's VA as Millia right?
[1:29:54] <Quesoazul9> It is sooo come together
[1:30:01] <andre11dr> Nago kinda needs his super to be safe because that's his only wakeup
[1:30:01] <WakeUpThrow> Blood rage reminds me of Arthur's armor break in MvC3 so much NotLikeThis
[1:30:08] <leith_aziz> @Josef_Stryker Must be. Tara Platt
[1:30:12] <Sulliman34> reggie's got a SCHNASTY millia goddamn
[1:30:26] <Yenwai> are grapplers hard to learn? or at least harder to learn than other types of characters? i always want to play them but can never figure out the grapples commands
[1:30:38] <+Catravan> nago going into blood rage or whatever it's called is just his lose condition isn't it
[1:30:38] <%drefizz> Who voiced Morrigan in MVC3?
[1:30:40] <%Josef_Stryker> They take a certain mindset u need to adopt
[1:30:45] <+Jack8274> LO
[1:30:47] <Applecannon63> Grapplers require patience
[1:30:48] <leith_aziz> Tara tends to have a certain "coolness" to her voice in general
[1:30:51] <HawkGoggles2> I believe you
[1:30:51] <TheVoltStrike> @Yenwai it depends on the game and the character dude, Bullet from blazblue is extremely easy for example
[1:30:58] <ElPlasa> @Yenwai I wouldn't say hard, they're different
[1:30:59] <Sulliman34> @Catravan basically. they made it a shorter duration now but its still 50%
[1:31:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Grapplers involve more mentality based gameplay
[1:31:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> empty jump ftw
[1:31:04] <Yenwai> i see
[1:31:05] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:31:09] <sunnythedrunk> LUL
[1:31:11] <+Jack8274> The standing neutral jump mindgames
[1:31:12] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:31:12] <leith_aziz> Grapplers can be really easy depending on the game

[1:31:23] <HawkGoggles2> he doesn't promise to win, but to do his best.
[1:31:26] <Cavumentum> Learn to play Rock Paper Scissors competitively, then pick Pot
[1:31:26] <+Catravan> @Sulliman34 least it doesn't kill him outright
[1:31:28] <Klefth> Seasoned just right
[1:31:32] <DasFreekman> a singular red pepper flake
[1:31:33] <andre11dr> @yenwai Depends, they can be but they get to co control situations more because they have BIG DAMAGE
[1:31:34] <Pookiedaexzile> A little Ziesty Callout
[1:31:35] <Sulliman34> i would say grapplers require more knowledge of game mechanics and character specific movement. you have to read and condition a lot harder BUT you get more punishment for it
[1:31:39] <%Josef_Stryker> Taking a page from Nago's advice book I see
[1:31:41] <%fetrigon> mmmmm

[1:34:29] <%Wool> @Sulliman34 changing stage
[1:34:30] <+AcquireCornbread> god damn this game fuckin rocks, i've been addicted to giovanna since last night and i can't stop playing lol
[1:34:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Nago: Let me even this up real quick, I'm doing to well
[1:34:36] <Sulliman34> @Sulliman34 oooooh
[1:34:38] <NaLLex9> Pretty much
[1:34:43] <%drefizz> @WakeUpThrow actually just looked her up, shes been in some recent stuff
[1:34:50] <leith_aziz> Strive is very addicting in generall from all I've played
[1:34:53] <Sulliman34> yeah thats the issue with nago imo now! he cant really get damage off his good pokes!
[1:34:56] <raveous> I like milia's english voice
[1:34:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:34:59] <+Hitorio> Does he LOOK like the type of MF who would run?
[1:35:01] <Dirty_Dandere> emmallamaSteppy emmallamaSteppy
[1:35:05] <%Josef_Stryker> Tara Platt is always a win.
[1:35:10] <%LastHazzerd> snow pallets
[1:35:11] <+Hitorio> Mitsuru, eh?
[1:35:16] <leith_aziz> Millia sounds great
[1:35:23] <Sulliman34> wheres the RINGS reggie
[1:35:25] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I REALLY dislike the dub tbh, especially Sol
[1:35:36] <overkrustice> @Hitorio Everyone looks badass in GG, even the cowards. so ye
[1:35:37] <leith_aziz> I tend to like Tara Platt's performance in general
[1:35:40] <Ardisan_> I LOVE the dub
[1:35:46] <Pookiedaexzile> This isn't Reggies Main I don't think
[1:35:48] <Sulliman34> i think the dub is good in places, bad in others
[1:35:52] <+Hitorio> I do quite value being able to understand what they're saying mid-battle. :P
[1:35:52] <Quesoazul9> Yo the air combos tho
[1:35:52] <+Jack8274> God that combo is juicy
[1:35:56] <%Josef_Stryker> There are several VAs where, no matter what role they get, they always kill it
[1:35:57] <leith_aziz> @Raven_In_A_Tree To be fair, we all tendo to dislike ENG Sol specifically
[1:36:02] <%Josef_Stryker> Tara Platt is one of them
[1:36:03] <sunnythedrunk> I think Nago, Zato, and Pot are def the best dubbed voices
[1:36:05] <+seduwu> who does reggie main?
[1:36:06] <Dirty_Dandere> LUL
[1:36:07] <leith_aziz> @Josef_Stryker Like Troy Baker?
[1:36:10] <Darkred28> LUL
[1:36:12] <overkrustice> Dub is fine, Japanese is just was better.
[1:36:13] <NotHereToStream> LUL
[1:36:15] <+Hitorio> Laura Bailey don't miss.
[1:36:20] <%fetrigon> LUL
[1:36:21] <DaKnightWarrior> Reggie zyzxLmao
[1:36:22] <+UberWolfman> Reggie blown up LUL
[1:36:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> small character health
[1:36:27] <nothuzad> pretty sure reggie has the most experience with Millia in Strive but he keeps switching
[1:36:28] <%Irridium> reggie's face LUL
[1:36:29] <Pookiedaexzile> The Dub is fine, but Axel is bad
[1:36:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> eat it Reggie
[1:36:30] <%Josef_Stryker> I'd say Troy Baker is one of them
[1:36:33] <leith_aziz> Matt Mercer is also really good in hir work
[1:36:35] <DasFreekman> wow that actually killed... used to potemkin guts
[1:36:37] <leith_aziz> *his
[1:36:47] <Sulliman34> youre getting conditioned! he heard you get upset about getting jabbed, so he knew you were gonna try to jab him out!
[1:36:49] <Quesoazul9> Does Nago care about Dandyism? or is that just a slayer/assassin thing
[1:36:51] <%drefizz> I'm tired of Laura Bailey and Troy being in games
[1:36:52] <%Josef_Stryker> As is Matt Mercer, JYB, Travis Willingham etc
[1:36:54] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Also some VAs sound kinda bored.
[1:36:56] <leith_aziz> @Quesoazul9 he does I think
[1:36:58] <+Hitorio> Papa Nier/Sojiro Sakura/Iron Tager also nails his roles
[1:37:01] <andre11dr> I do like that Nago has such a wild play style, it shows me that they won't be afraid to bring back the more self destructive caracters like Robo Ky or ABA
[1:37:08] <%Josef_Stryker> Jamieson Price is always great.
[1:37:12] <+glgzephyr> @leith_aziz Yeah, I loved Matt as Villagers 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 11 in NieR Replicant LUL
[1:37:22] <leith_aziz> Jamieson Price is a really good actor
[1:37:23] <Sulliman34> i miss you nago 5K loops ;-;
[1:37:35] <+Hitorio> I couldn't tell those villagers were Matt Mercer, and I get the feeling I don't want to learn to identify his voice - lest I be haunted.
[1:37:36] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Pots VA his buster is like.... Sad
[1:37:41] <NaLLex9> Nice Reggie lets go
[1:37:45] <%FallenAngelZelos> This song is soooo good
[1:37:50] <Nikbottom> I think GG vampires just need to be obsesed with some way of life
[1:37:54] <leith_aziz> Sayonara!
[1:37:55] <%Josef_Stryker> I was expecting Pot to sound more like Chris Sabat
[1:38:03] <Sulliman34> nago seems to value Bushido over Dandyism
[1:38:05] <%Josef_Stryker> I won't face my doom, SAYONARA
[1:38:06] <%fetrigon> Reggie
[1:38:11] <+Hitorio> No Chris Tucker voice for Nagoriyuki? Kappa
[1:38:13] <leith_aziz> Pot's voice I didnt like because it didnt have much oomph
[1:38:15] <Applecannon63> ooo damn the lighting
[1:38:16] <%CalderGaming> """punish"""
[1:38:19] <%fetrigon> what was that punish
[1:38:20] <%kyh9> REGGIE
[1:38:21] <nothuzad> but dandyism is everything BibleThump

[1:38:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Bushido<Dandyism
[1:38:57] <Quesoazul9> Facts^
[1:38:57] <Uselesswhitenoise> Actually I just realized the real reason i want every character in Strive is because i want every single character to get a vocal theme song
[1:38:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> REGGIE
[1:39:00] <andre11dr> Liam O'Brian should totally voice Slayer
[1:39:04] <point4effort> That damage holy hell
[1:39:07] <DaKnightWarrior> lytOUCH
[1:39:08] <NaLLex9> GOD DAMN thats rough
[1:39:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Liam O Brian aint missed in a minute, but If I'm calling out new Stars, Ichiban/Faust is killing it
[1:39:11] <Jaysky> DESTRUCTION OF HP
[1:39:11] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr oh, that'd be perfect
[1:39:13] <%Josef_Stryker> Leo sounds more regal than I was expecting. I figured he would have a more hammy warrior-esque voice like when he voiced Rider.
[1:39:15] <DaKnightWarrior> Poor Nago
[1:39:17] <+Hitorio> Headcanon: Millia shapeshifts her hair into small hands under her hat that keep it from falling off her head.
[1:39:22] <Quesoazul9> Gotta say, no Nago match is boring
[1:39:34] <Quesoazul9> Someone is gonna blow up, just gotta see who
[1:39:39] <user_naim> @hitorio amazing
[1:39:40] <DaKnightWarrior> @quesoazul9 true
[1:39:47] <%drefizz> I can barely understand what EN faust is saying cause his voice is so distorted
[1:39:48] <leith_aziz> @Pookiedaexzile Im not sure about Faust, but I love me some Ichiban. Ending made me cry
[1:39:50] <NaLLex9> He really needs to gain more blood from his normals
[1:39:50] <Sulliman34> nago rammy is a SAD matchup. nago just cant compete. he cant delete the swords with his projectile ;w;
[1:40:05] <+glgzephyr> @Hitorio Probably simpler to just weave strands of hair through the threads of the hat
[1:40:08] <Sulliman34> goddamn millia whats with your guts
[1:40:08] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie Mashin there
[1:40:13] <Saltmeisterr> @andre11dr Fun fact, Liam was the va for axl in the xrd dub
[1:40:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:40:21] <+Shishi1205> Does Rem have a bad matchup?
[1:40:24] <%Josef_Stryker> @drefizz I think it kinda works considering how unhinged he is
[1:40:41] <+Shishi1205> Feels like she's super strong and gets wallsplats super easily
[1:40:42] <%Josef_Stryker> I just wasn't expecting Ichiban to voice him
[1:40:45] <+glgzephyr> @Shishi1205 No one knows yet. Game's not out
[1:40:48] <+Hitorio> @glgzephyr True
[1:40:52] <MrKaraz> @Shishi1205 May EZ
[1:41:00] <Sulliman34> uuuh rammy can get kinda messed up by people with good oki since her only reversal is metered
[1:41:01] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Ram feels overtuned, I know she is busted because i actually won online with her and i super suck
[1:41:04] <leith_aziz> I dont know about ENG Faust, but you wont see me harping on Kaiji Tang
[1:41:10] <overkrustice> May is Bae
[1:41:25] <leith_aziz> Man, Millia has some mix
[1:41:25] <Sulliman34> rammy feels a bit MORE in line now but i would rather other characters get buffed than her get nerfed down
[1:41:25] <+glgzephyr> Ram is a lot more balanced in this beta than the last one
[1:41:26] <%Josef_Stryker> Kaiji Tang does good work.
[1:41:30] <Dave_VD> Axl is absolute vile degeneracy and I love it
[1:41:31] <%Josef_Stryker> I fucking love him as Ichibam
[1:41:35] <%Josef_Stryker> *Ichiban
[1:41:36] <leith_aziz> ^
[1:41:37] <MrKaraz> speaking as a Ram player who gets fucked by Every. Single. May online
[1:41:44] <+Shishi1205> Pot vs Axl is misery incarnate
[1:41:53] <Sulliman34> yeah May is the true understated menace. May is FUCKED UP GOOD in this beta
[1:41:55] <%Deft_Thought> Man, Millia looks great in motion in this game
[1:42:00] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 Nago Vs Axl is even worse I'd say
[1:42:02] <+glgzephyr> TOTSUGEKIII
[1:42:03] <%fetrigon> NICE
[1:42:09] <+spardanwarrior> Kaiji Tang was Faust's English VA back in Xrd
[1:42:09] <Saltmeisterr> Kaiji also did Gearless Joe in Megalobox
[1:42:15] <andre11dr> Also it doesn't matter who they pick for the dub ,Johnny is staying on JP nothing can change my opinion
[1:42:18] <+Shishi1205> Maybe but pot has no projectile
[1:42:18] <sevvin09> Man, the English voices are FANTASTIC
[1:42:24] <%Josef_Stryker> He's also Iwai in P5
[1:42:30] <Jaysky> Mil looks good standing still too
[1:42:31] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 He has techinically
[1:42:33] <Pookiedaexzile> @Saltmeisterr  GOATED
[1:42:38] <+glgzephyr> I really want to be able to toggle language for each character.
[1:42:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Done
[1:42:42] <+Shishi1205> ground slam?
[1:42:43] <Ardisan_> O my god Reggie putting in work
[1:42:45] <Dave_VD> @Shishi1205 If the pot is good I actually think that one of the harder match-ups for Axl
[1:42:49] <leith_aziz> @glgzephyr Agreed. Best of both worlds
[1:42:51] <%Tenchi_G> Tenchi_G is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community!

[1:43:08] <+glgzephyr> Like, Dub Pot is fine, but Sub Pot goes HAM
[1:43:08] <Sulliman34> oh yeah how is nago's 6K in this beta
[1:43:10] <ColeDingo> huh, theres a dub
[1:43:18] <+Shishi1205> maybe if you can jump from one corner to corner with the fautless thingy
[1:43:19] <%fetrigon> that was way too close LUL
[1:43:20] <ColeDingo> wasnt expecting that
[1:43:20] <scarman125> I'll be first to admit i know nothing about fighting games but is Nago just trash now?
[1:43:23] <nothuzad> lets go reggie V:
[1:43:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie we're ready for you, come let us body you
[1:43:31] <user_naim> Woolie putting up a good fight
[1:43:37] <leith_aziz> @scarman125 Not really. He's just hard to play well
[1:43:39] <Sulliman34> @scarman125 trash? no, he can compete, its just a VERY uphill battle for him now
[1:43:42] <+glgzephyr> Nago got nerfed overall from last beta to this one.
[1:43:44] <Applecannon63> Nago is not trash but a bit difficult
[1:43:45] <Picia000123> english dub does not sound as great as in DBFZ so far
[1:43:45] <leith_aziz> Gotta be good with footsies
[1:43:53] <Pookiedaexzile> @scarman125 He was trash, this has made it worse if you're talking about competing
[1:43:56] <%Deft_Thought> Is her VA supposed to sound British? cmonBruh
[1:43:56] <+pingpong7045> @andre11dr He was voiced by Liam O' Brian in Xrd.
[1:43:56] <Sulliman34> he was already on the lower tier AND he got nerfed, so hes not feeling great right now
[1:43:56] <+glgzephyr> He's not in a good place in comparison with the rest of the cast
[1:44:06] <+Shishi1205> Nago only got like 2 buffs, the bite and the 6P
[1:44:07] <+Hitorio> Where's Nagoriyuki's big booty vampire gf?
[1:44:10] <andre11dr> Nago got nerfed but he got faster
[1:44:11] <Saltmeisterr> @andre11dr no that was axl
[1:44:12] <leith_aziz> @Deft_Thought Its suppoused to sound classy/regal
[1:44:13] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I dont think Nago is bad but i literally only see Sol Ky Ram and May players
[1:44:21] <Sulliman34> anji is kinda bad
[1:44:23] <Sulliman34> sadly
[1:44:26] <user_naim> Does Giovanna have any interesting matchups?
[1:44:28] <+Shishi1205> Is he?
[1:44:31] <drefizz> how?
[1:44:32] <leith_aziz> DAMN
[1:44:34] <Quesoazul9> what's wrong with anji?
[1:44:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Nago is tourney Trash, Online okay
[1:44:34] <leith_aziz> gg
[1:44:35] <Picia000123> I have the same opinion on Nago as the first time he was released: he was born to be low tier, unless they redesign the character
[1:44:36] <+Shishi1205> I find anji real fun
[1:44:38] <%CalderGaming> GOOOOOONE
[1:44:41] <Darkred28> Fucking sent to the stratosphere
[1:44:43] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Mkay. Her win quote sound like it had a bit of an accent which I thought was weird.
[1:44:44] <%drefizz> Sulliman 1v1 me
[1:44:46] <jl_arts> bonk
[1:44:54] <NaLLex9> @user_naim Interesting how??
[1:44:56] <Dave_VD> @user_naim Play her and find out
[1:44:57] <DedlokPM> doodOne
[1:45:00] <%Deft_Thought> I guess she doesn't HAVE to have a Russian accent
[1:45:01] <+Hitorio> I like his face so much more now that they recolored his lips
[1:45:03] <Applecannon63> Anji way too heavy for some people to play
[1:45:04] <sunnythedrunk> @user_naim She's a ton of fun if that's what you mean
[1:45:06] <+glgzephyr> @Deft_Thought Tara Platt just has a unique cadence to her voice
[1:45:11] <Sulliman34> guard points are weak/tiny, parry is punishable by certain far slashes or 2P mash. i think he just needs some adjustments, hes ALMOST there
[1:45:12] <user_naim> @nallex9 really good or bad i guess
[1:45:14] <%Deft_Thought> @glgzephyr Yah true
[1:45:15] <leith_aziz> @Deft_Thought Millia's russian.
[1:45:17] <andre11dr> Anji is seems really solid, fujin is still the god move it was before
[1:45:26] <+glgzephyr> and I love it Kreygasm
[1:45:33] <Jaysky> I need to hear totsugeki shouted in my ear every 5 seconds or else I'm going to go nuts
[1:45:33] <+Shishi1205> Maybe its because I switched from Pot to Anji so I dont feel that slow
[1:45:37] <Quesoazul9> I noticed the butter fly seemed slower and movement seemed heavier
[1:45:40] <leith_aziz> Mixed
[1:45:44] <user_naim> @dave_vd i have, but i’m so bad i can’t really figure out character match ups vs just player skill
[1:45:45] <Sulliman34> maybe i just havent seen great anjis tho! everyone in servers im in says hes a little underwhelming comparativley
[1:45:47] <andre11dr> He mostly just seems like a slower +R +R Anji
[1:45:47] <leith_aziz> He's getting it!
[1:45:56] <Quesoazul9> If the guard points get better I'm sure he'll be fun
[1:45:57] <+Shishi1205> The only slow thing is that damn butterfly
[1:46:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> I really miss the xrd health bars
[1:46:10] <+Shishi1205> and maybe the anti air one
[1:46:12] <+glgzephyr> @andre11dr The whole game is slower than +R, so I'd hope so
[1:46:19] <user_naim> Giovanna is fucken drugs level fun anyway
[1:46:23] <PFlare> Is it just me, or does that bite drain a LOT more than it used to?
[1:46:23] <Dave_VD> @user_naim I would just worry about developing your style and skill than 'matchups'.
[1:46:25] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Yup. I typed that after this post
[1:46:26] <user_naim> Love her
[1:46:32] <DaKnightWarrior> Yeah, Gio is super fun.
[1:46:33] <Sulliman34> im not saying anji needs to be +r anji, i just think he could use some TLC
[1:46:40] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah Gio is dummy fun
[1:46:40] <user_naim> @dave_vd fair
[1:46:45] <Quesoazul9> @PFlare Yep, bite got buffed
[1:46:46] <NaLLex9> @user_naim I mean she bullies Axl, but has it a little rough against the most played characters imo
[1:46:47] <leith_aziz> OH
[1:46:54] <%Deft_Thought> #when'sZappa
[1:47:05] <leith_aziz> uhhh
[1:47:07] <Sulliman34> zappa got exorcized how do you expect him to fight
[1:47:07] <leith_aziz> ok?
[1:47:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> anji needs better hard knockdowns cause he literally only has them off his grab and his dp, I'd like to use that butterfly more
[1:47:07] <PFlare> Chipout.
[1:47:11] <ElPlasa> CHIP
[1:47:11] <%Wool> chip?
[1:47:14] <DaCheekyOne> chip
[1:47:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[1:47:14] <Jaysky> Risk
[1:47:16] <DaKnightWarrior> We take those
[1:47:17] <leith_aziz> Chip I guess
[1:47:19] <Quesoazul9> @Deft_Thought Hopefully never, though the ghosts would look amazing
[1:47:19] <%fetrigon> chip?
[1:47:20] <+yeknomlive> he talking about fd
[1:47:21] <+Hitorio> Giovanna fun, eh? What makes her so fun? Never touched Strive.
[1:47:26] <Pookiedaexzile> That's still cash
[1:47:30] <Pookiedaexzile> We still take those
[1:47:34] <leith_aziz> @Hitorio Moves feel good to use
[1:47:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> which coast and park
[1:47:38] <MagumaDono> Awww here we go
[1:47:38] <Sulliman34> gios forward and backdash on the ground are SO FAST
[1:47:40] <g0d_zill4> Let's gooo
[1:47:40] <+glgzephyr> @Hitorio She big dummy rushdown
[1:47:44] <DasFreekman> does the tension guard stop chip?
[1:47:45] <Sulliman34> also gio dash 2S is a god button
[1:47:46] <Saltmeisterr> online time
[1:47:46] <user_naim> @hitorio you dash and she does cool kicks i guess
[1:47:47] <andre11dr> That range man, jt almost makes the pop worth
[1:47:49] <Ardisan_> Gio moves feel great
[1:47:50] <leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus : Just use Park is my advice
[1:47:51] <user_naim> just fun
[1:47:56] <Sulliman34> @DasFreekman yes! Faultless defense will stop any chip
[1:47:59] <leith_aziz> damn, stage 10 already
[1:48:01] <sunnythedrunk> Gio is a rushdown character with most moves safe on block. Movement feels good too
[1:48:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> which coast
[1:48:09] <leith_aziz> Somebody's been working
[1:48:09] <overkrustice> lets heart may
[1:48:11] <%Wool> only in the tower
[1:48:12] <DotDusk> monkaS
[1:48:13] <leith_aziz> Nice
[1:48:18] <%drefizz> I feel like Kim Mai guest would have been a better voice for Millia
[1:48:19] <Jaysky> Can we get a shoutout for Gio's shirt buttons? They've got quite a monumental task.
[1:48:20] <DotDusk> Life at risk
[1:48:20] <+Hitorio> i c i c
[1:48:21] <Sulliman34> yeah gio has a lot of plus on block specials that are interruptable on startup, so she forces you to figure out gaps
[1:48:25] <leith_aziz> EU is also pretty loaded
[1:48:33] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I can only play unga because my brain doesn't know the meaning of block
[1:48:37] <Sulliman34> i believe gio's flipkick and cannon spike are both plus
[1:48:37] <+Ben_Ben817> I can't wait for the possible Majin Obama rematch
[1:48:38] <leith_aziz> Netcode will handle it for the most part I'd say
[1:48:40] <Murdercles> COME TO BRAZIL
[1:48:42] <+glgzephyr> why would you choose AUS, the worst internet in the world
[1:48:42] <leith_aziz> Rollback, remember?
[1:48:44] <user_naim> safe on block too yeah
[1:48:53] <DaRoosta89> I dont see Nago's rage as useful outside of 100% confirming a kill
[1:49:01] <MagumaDono> omwww
[1:49:01] <sunnythedrunk> My only gripe with Gio is her DP should have some kind of invincibility on the tip
[1:49:02] <leith_aziz> but it IS Australia...
[1:49:04] <leith_aziz> hmmm
[1:49:05] <+glgzephyr> there are 6 people here.
[1:49:05] <andre11dr> This game has plenty of unga to choose from
[1:49:07] <NotHereToStream> 19 already LUL
[1:49:11] <leith_aziz> 23
[1:49:12] <Pookiedaexzile> If you hate blocking do I have a game for you same company, DBZ fighters, If you're blocking you're losing
[1:49:26] <Sulliman34> @sunnythedrunk agreed BUT thats also usually the tradeoffs with high rushdown characters, they get rushed down themselves
[1:49:28] <Saltmeisterr> @andre11dr but little setplay :(
[1:49:28] <%drefizz> @stormhawk9891 Oh shit its you!
[1:49:39] <Ardisan_> @pookiedaexzile Kinda why its hard for me to get into
[1:49:39] <leith_aziz> @Pookiedaexzile As a guy who did not use it at low level, I advise you sue Reflect
[1:49:41] <+glgzephyr> lmao
[1:49:47] <VJdarkworld> 2D lobby so confusing NotLikeThis
[1:49:47] <@Menitta> goddamn
[1:49:50] <stormhawk9891> @drefizz MEEEE
[1:49:51] <TheVoltStrike> YEP, GOOD LOBBY
[1:49:52] <Murdercles> i cant believe they are trying this lobby garbage again LUL
[1:49:57] <%Eaglestrike117> Nah its the duel station
[1:50:01] <leith_aziz> geez, too many people lining up
[1:50:01] <%Eaglestrike117> Just swap stations
[1:50:02] <DaKnightWarrior> Here we go again lytOUCH
[1:50:03] <+Hitorio> Turning the lobby from 3D to 2D was such a strange move.
[1:50:03] <BlackermanZX> 2d lobby
[1:50:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> try a few more times
[1:50:07] <%drefizz> Everyone is fighting
[1:50:08] <BlackermanZX> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:50:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's the zervers
[1:50:09] <iacus_> good music
[1:50:11] <+glgzephyr> this has happened to me often
[1:50:15] <Sulliman34> mmmm strive lobbies
[1:50:18] <+Lazy_2> just got here. is this lobby still garbage?
[1:50:23] <%drefizz> LUL
[1:50:23] <leith_aziz> Woolie, select another "screen" and let people jump to you
[1:50:23] <+Hitorio> Pirates of the Caribbean lobby music
[1:50:24] <WakeUpThrow> What an amazing idea for a lobby, look at how intuitive it is
[1:50:24] <TheVoltStrike> please arcys just a big red "FIGHT THIS BITCH" button that's all we want
[1:50:25] <sunnythedrunk> @Sulliman34 This is true, but I think she does have other flaws too. I think it should at least anti air in front consistently
[1:50:25] <SpookyBeef7> Yeah, lobby servers are still super wonky.
[1:50:26] <%Sparkseid> amazing
[1:50:26] <Ultimatefool> The line to fight Woolie LUL
[1:50:26] <%Wool> I think it's because people are all trying to join at once
[1:50:28] <+glgzephyr> @Lazy_2 only slightly less trash
[1:50:28] <leith_aziz> Had a similar issue
[1:50:36] <%Major_Lee_> Lobbies still not great
[1:50:38] <%drefizz> AUS server LUL
[1:50:38] <leith_aziz> WAY too many people to close
[1:50:39] <Sulliman34> @sunnythedrunk yeah that and her air super need some touch ups, very inconsistent
[1:50:39] <%Eaglestrike117> Yeah, its everyone trying to snipe
[1:50:40] <BackwardCap> Can you get random matchmaking from training in lobbies?
[1:50:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Couldn't just be a button
[1:50:42] <andre11dr> Sometimes it just refuses to give you certain people
[1:50:43] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah I had to restart the game to make it work
[1:50:45] <g0d_zill4> what an amazing lobby system
[1:50:45] <+glgzephyr> lmao there is a line
[1:50:46] <Saltmeisterr> good lobby :)
[1:50:48] <+Hitorio> We should play complete games of tetris in order to challenge another player.
[1:50:51] <+glgzephyr> just naturally formed
[1:50:52] <leith_aziz> OK, too many people
[1:50:54] <PFlare> Holy shit.
[1:50:55] <user_naim> Lobby has a 8–2 matchup with streamers
[1:50:57] <Pookiedaexzile> we coulda just had a button but noooo
[1:51:01] <+Lazy_2> cool
[1:51:05] <sunnythedrunk> @Sulliman34 Yeah totally agree. I've have people fall out of ground super too.
[1:51:11] <+glgzephyr> tell everyone to queue up at stations
[1:51:19] <+glgzephyr> then just pick from the list
[1:51:21] <andre11dr> It did shit like that for me without the crowd
[1:51:22] <+yeknomlive> jesus arcsys
[1:51:22] <%Wool> SOMEONE ELSE TOOK THE SPOT
[1:51:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> ONE STEP FORWARD AND 2 STEPS BACK
[1:51:30] <%Wool> ALEPH GO AWAY
[1:51:33] <Pookiedaexzile> I know they did this for character Avatars....but let me ask you this....why not just let us make custom colors for our mains
[1:51:42] <leith_aziz> Also sometimes the floor might be bugges, so I jump out of park and go back
[1:51:42] <sunnythedrunk> You might have to restart the game
[1:51:49] <leith_aziz> *bugged
[1:51:50] <%LastHazzerd> thuggery
[1:51:50] <DaKnightWarrior> Back Off lytUSEGUN
[1:51:56] <Murdercles> not everyone on the planet is watching your stream LUL
[1:51:58] <%drefizz> might need to restart
[1:51:58] <odd_slater> I'm sure there's people that aren't watching the stream that are just there as well right?
[1:51:59] <+yeknomlive> there was a bug like this on rank up
[1:52:00] <Sulliman34> yeah this might be a restart issue?
[1:52:01] <BlackermanZX> is it bugged?
[1:52:09] <%Wool> @b_aleph how dare you
[1:52:18] <MagumaDono> The station loads weird but it happens
[1:52:20] <leith_aziz> @odd_slater wasnt it 8 people before Woolie jumped in?
[1:52:21] <+FuqBoiSlim> Saugatuck, Arc System Works
[1:52:21] <VJdarkworld> 2D lobbies be like *20 people stacked ontop of each other in 1 spot*
[1:52:23] <andre11dr> Security security, keep away from the president!
[1:52:26] <+Hitorio> Just give the players zBrush and let us model our own OCs Kappa
[1:52:28] <leith_aziz> ZA WARUDO
[1:52:33] <+gg_aleph> @Wool I didn't notice it was you again bruh, sorry
[1:52:33] <sunnythedrunk> I miss XRD lobbies
[1:52:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> the stations sometimes literally just don't connect correctly
[1:52:36] <NotHereToStream> m8
[1:52:38] <+yeknomlive> sounds like a pot main
[1:52:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> and you gotta mash on it
[1:52:42] <+Hitorio> ooo. Nice intro, mr shorts.
[1:52:45] <%Deft_Thought> Axl's so cool
[1:52:45] <Civet10> yop : )
[1:52:45] <Saltmeisterr> YOP
[1:52:53] <Picia000123> It sounds so weird in English NotLikeThis
[1:52:54] <NaLLex9> I hate that the lag in the lobby makes it impossible to make a line
[1:52:55] <%fetrigon> mmmmmm
[1:52:57] <SpookyBeef7> Man, still crazy that Octopimp got picked for Axl's voice.
[1:52:57] <%drefizz> why does Axl sound like he plays Pot
[1:52:57] <%kyh9> Yasuke vibes
[1:53:00] <leith_aziz> SourPls
[1:53:02] <user_naim> Okay axl EN is pretty good
[1:53:02] <BackwardCap> WHO?
[1:53:02] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus Best bet is probably to legit just go down the lobby list and call out who gets to fight, the line aint gonna work well here i think
[1:53:03] <Murdercles> thats not even the same name
[1:53:04] <+gg_aleph> I don't have the stream audio on btw
[1:53:06] <BlackermanZX> octo woolieMIRIN
[1:53:08] <andre11dr> I wish they just has a menu like a normal fighting game
[1:53:09] <+glgzephyr> that name is different from the subtitle LUL
[1:53:10] <+Hitorio> Axl sounds like he's just here for the free food.
[1:53:10] <%ChrisBardow> We doing viewer matches this stream?
[1:53:10] <g0d_zill4> Kazuna who?!
[1:53:13] <gunstars20> Octo let's go
[1:53:13] <FlowLethal> who does Nago work for?
[1:53:14] <%Eaglestrike117> Whoever isnt playing can call it out and keep track
[1:53:17] <overkrustice> They finally fixed Axls outfit then they ruined him with that voice.
[1:53:18] <+CawffeeMike> dear fighting games... get better at lobbies :(
[1:53:18] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Welcome to Arcsys games
[1:53:21] <%ChrisBardow> Oh nvm
[1:53:22] <Saltmeisterr> K A B O O M
[1:53:25] <andre11dr> I know
[1:53:25] <Vashido22> @Flowlethal probably slayer
[1:53:26] <FlowLethal> he said he was body guard
[1:53:27] <PFlare> I'm liking Axl's voice.
[1:53:30] <+yeknomlive> batter up
[1:53:35] <Raven_In_A_Tree> What they say matches neither the subs or the lips LUL
[1:53:36] <andre11dr> It all of them too
[1:53:38] <+glgzephyr> why would you press button

[1:53:41] <SheefEatsBeef> HAVIN A LAUGH
[1:53:45] <Ultimatefool> Fuck your HP
[1:53:47] <SpookyBeef7> ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU
[1:53:48] <gunstars20> LUL
[1:53:48] <odd_slater> @cawffeemike It's just this game lol
[1:53:52] <+LandOfTheWay> why you pressin buttons? LUL
[1:53:52] <%Josef_Stryker> I'm pretty sure Nago is deliberately inspired by Yasuke.
[1:53:52] <%andrewofbob> "I did a thing"
[1:53:54] <%Deft_Thought> You chose POORLY
[1:54:03] <NotHereToStream> command grab all day
[1:54:09] <+Hitorio> The Lil Bussy Man command grab.
[1:54:09] <leith_aziz> Arcsystem games tend to always try to "personalise" their lobbies. This is something I feel needs adjusted in the future
[1:54:12] <user_naim> ”There it is”
[1:54:20] <+KilogramHours> Is Axl Low Bri'ish or Aussie?
[1:54:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:54:21] <g0d_zill4> My theory for Nago is that he's a retainer for some powerful Japanese Lord trying to start a revolution or something, since his name is super Japanese sounding
[1:54:28] <leith_aziz> This game's lobby was just expected to happen at this point
[1:54:29] <%Eaglestrike117> He be british
[1:54:35] <+LandOfTheWay> @kilogramhours bri'ish
[1:54:41] <DerpioParty> Alleyoop!
[1:54:43] <+glgzephyr> @Eaglestrike117 Well, he's trying anyways
[1:54:44] <Murdercles> I dont think the VA knows what it is LUL
[1:54:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay, should we the line all back up like a foot to give whoever room
[1:54:47] <+Hitorio> Nagoriyuki laying down on the floor like Slayer seems kind of odd since he seems so serious the rest of the time. Hmm
[1:54:48] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's chewsday innit
[1:54:49] <+CawffeeMike> it is, but there are still challenges in other fighting games too, (which has def been covered) where the time to get into games, versus the time in actual play ratio is a little nuts. had that problem in Sam sho too.
[1:54:55] <%Irridium> we doin rematches?
[1:54:59] <leith_aziz> @g0d_zill4 All I know is that Nago is a vampire and MIGHT know Slayer
[1:55:01] <+CawffeeMike> this game is dope. even with the lobby issue tho
[1:55:02] <PFlare> @Hitorio He was trained by Slayer.
[1:55:12] <leith_aziz> Yep. No more time in lobbies
[1:55:19] <Raven_In_A_Tree> The VA doesnt know the difference so dont worry
[1:55:25] <stormhawk9891> Shit I accidentally hit the R-code button
[1:55:25] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz I thought the personality lobby thing was cool back in Xrd but over the years it just proved to be annoying
[1:55:26] <+Hitorio> Usually, people that lay down like that don't take anything seriously - like Slayer and Elizabeth
[1:55:33] <+Hitorio> Nagoriyuki seems like a srs samurai kinda guy.
[1:55:35] <Dave_VD> Lol if Woolie had won he wouldn't have rematched him
[1:55:55] <+glgzephyr> @Hitorio He picked up the landing tech from Slayer.
[1:55:58] <%fetrigon> @dave_vd LUL
[1:56:00] <+Hitorio> Unless Nago is a secret goofball and I've missed some parts of his character. :p
[1:56:04] <MagumaDono> I'm sure he woulda rematched the long way :P
[1:56:09] <FlowLethal> what is axls accent suppose to be?
[1:56:12] <+CawffeeMike> tbh , this game might be kinda dope on parsec
[1:56:15] <+Hitorio> lol "landing tech"
[1:56:17] <+spardanwarrior> British punk
[1:56:21] <+R0kushi> space australia
[1:56:22] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Yeah, I liked it alot actually. But I know there's some people who JUST want to get into the game like Max. Im not like that, but there is an audience who wants that
[1:56:24] <%drefizz> Chinese
[1:56:24] <PFlare> @Hitorio His taunt is literally just him talking about onigiri for like, 40 seconds.
[1:56:24] <Applecannon63> @hitorio Nago is a Onigiri enthusiast
[1:56:29] <+glgzephyr> 0 Rollback frames, btw.
[1:56:41] <Pookiedaexzile> @RobocopSanchez Space OutbackSteakhouse
[1:56:41] <+Hitorio> @PFlare Okay. There it is. :P
[1:56:42] <DerpioParty> Less Alley.  More Oop
[1:56:46] <+pingpong7045> @CawffeeMike Why would you want to switch from rollback to delay?
[1:56:46] <+glgzephyr> Parsec can eat its heart out, this netcode is godlike
[1:56:50] <+yeknomlive> oh did time stop run out after the grab?
[1:56:57] <sunnythedrunk> Heavy bugger LUL
[1:57:09] <+CawffeeMike> yeah... I guess you right ><
[1:57:09] <leith_aziz> Parsec would be even worse because you get delay connection
[1:57:13] <%Irridium> damn gg
[1:57:14] <DerpioParty> No one seems to notice these fights except that one girl in the background
[1:57:19] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz Yeah bye hour 80 the lobby doesn't do shit for me ,i just want to get to matches quick
[1:57:20] <leith_aziz> Especially at long distance
[1:57:20] <+KilogramHours> IM BEAT EY
[1:57:22] <someyounguy1> ah you killed octo!
[1:57:23] <sevvin09> With the netcode, visuals, characters, and mechanics, this game is def gonna be the premier fgc game for a LONG time.
[1:57:26] <FullMetalSnorlax> are they playing online poeple now? wha is th room number?
[1:57:32] <%Irridium> oh word?
[1:57:32] <%Wool> it wasn't 2-0?
[1:57:36] <+KilogramHours> He should have a line saying, "YOU HAVE A LOICENTS FOR THAT?"
[1:57:39] <sunnythedrunk> It was 1-1
[1:57:43] <%fetrigon> oh well
[1:57:45] <+Hitorio> Makes you wonder - are superpowered fights in this location Literally Tuesday for these civilians?
[1:57:46] <sevvin09> 1-1
[1:57:53] <Bunyanator> Where is oceania?

[1:58:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah, let em finish the set
[1:58:08] <+CawffeeMike> that's awesome
[1:58:20] <EnderGamma> it's infinite in the park @stormhawk9891
[1:58:29] <Pookiedaexzile> If you want to know why the Guys in the back aren't reacting you need to watch the Guilty Gear Retrospective on WOOLIEVERSUS Yt
[1:58:31] <Applecannon63> @Woolieversus Its only 3 matches in Rank
[1:58:33] <%LastHazzerd> there's the clothesline
[1:58:36] <leith_aziz> I see Axl players still making use of that grab
[1:58:42] <+Shishi1205> Damn that axl got hands
[1:58:43] <nothuzad> Hitorio well the GG world wen through multiple apocalyptic wars "not taht long ago" + "magic" is the basis of their society
[1:58:47] <Pookiedaexzile> new episodes every when ever woolie gets teh fight money
[1:58:49] <+glgzephyr> ONE B&B.
[1:59:03] <+Hitorio> Nice plug. Might go check out Woolie's lore vidyas.
[1:59:04] <andre11dr> That was fast
[1:59:06] <NaLLex9> Theres the guts

[1:59:31] <+KilogramHours> HES SO BRITISH
[1:59:33] <sevvin09> Was the duration of bloodrage mode shortened or something?
[1:59:45] <Jontman42> why doesn't Woolie do BTTV emotes?
[1:59:47] <Pookiedaexzile> It kills you faster
[1:59:49] <+R0kushi> it is @sevvin09
[1:59:50] <%Irridium> alright there it is LUL
[1:59:51] <leith_aziz> gg
[2:00:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> now we move forward
[2:00:02] <%Irridium> gg's
[2:00:05] <andre11dr> Ok maybe they should go back to the old Nago ,he popped in like 3 moves LUL
[2:00:10] <+Hitorio> Nagoriyuki is disappointed in Jorts Man
[2:00:22] <+glgzephyr> @Pookiedaexzile It does take off much less HP total. Before it was I think 80%? Now it's closer to 55%
[2:00:24] <Annat3l> does someone have a clip or timestamp of when woolie commented on Octopimp voicing Axl, assuming he did so?
[2:00:25] <Ultimatefool> Nagoriyuki's English VA is pretty good

[2:01:02] <leith_aziz> "Use Fujin to punish the opponent for playing the game"
[2:01:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Less Damage, Faster Drain, equals Danger fast,
[2:01:04] <+mental_mashup> Yeah they took the kick combos out and raised his blood gain so people had to play more risky but both of those together make it rough for nago
[2:01:05] <+Shishi1205> FUUJIN
[2:01:16] <+natrelchocomilk> I heard Woolie say that he could beat Reggie in a ft10. Is that true?
[2:01:17] <+Hitorio> His glasses look like they're specifically for looking at things less than a foot away from his face. Makes ya think.
[2:01:21] <+CawffeeMike> as critical as I am of this system, I'm pumped for this game. I'm gonna play tf out of it.
[2:01:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:07:04] <%FallenAngelZelos> What?!
[2:07:05] <Applecannon63> SWING
[2:07:05] <Nekros4442> Is Woolie fighting Chat yet?
[2:07:06] <+Hitorio> Baiken "kinda iffy," eh? Guilty Gear getting into that iffy shippy territory
[2:07:09] <+glgzephyr> Can Anji counter that super on flash?

[2:07:26] <stormhawk9891> YOOO
[2:07:29] <+Shishi1205> Damn Im taking notes of that dp usage
[2:07:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie using the Blood Guage to make it fair, I guess that is what the thumb glove is for
[2:07:35] <Pookiedaexzile> honor
[2:07:40] <%jepupu> Who the hell gets a DP they can double jump out of?
[2:07:41] <leith_aziz> @Hitorio From what I know, Baiken doesnt care about much other than getting revenge and taking care of her village
[2:07:41] <+Hitorio> I hear Blazblue has a ship in it that's kind of technically not incest but is kind of incest
[2:07:50] <+Funky_Honkey> I like how the GG theme is nothing but nonsense and no one cares
[2:07:52] <deviljhojho_> A death by inches
[2:08:05] <+yeknomlive> @Hitorio that's the option select
[2:08:11] <PFlare> @Hitorio Yeah, it's complicated.
[2:08:12] <%ChoculaUltra> Anji's Eng Dub voice is a lot deeper than I had anticipated but I ain't mad at it
[2:08:14] <leith_aziz> @Hitorio They aint related in the slightest if thats what you mean
[2:08:15] <g0d_zill4> @Funky_Honkey It's nonsense, but PASSIONATE nonsense
[2:08:15] <+Hitorio> @Funky_Honkey There has been a noticeable increase in those who want to learn the smell of the game.
[2:08:16] <Pookiedaexzile> "Techinically" and Incest in the same sentence is a no from the culture
[2:08:36] <deviljhojho_> well, technically....
[2:08:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:08:42] <dontfeedthechocobo> aye
[2:08:46] <PFlare> The situation involves clones, that's really all I can say for sure.
[2:08:46] <leith_aziz> FUJIN
[2:08:47] <BlackermanZX> the slap
[2:08:49] <+glgzephyr> @Pookiedaexzile idk what the other guy's on about, but there's no incest
[2:08:51] <Applecannon63> if you're talking about the yandre brother and sister then yeah…
[2:08:55] <therealtacopancakes> damn all those explosion and shit look crazy
[2:09:02] <Dave_VD> They made the remask animation way less laggy. That's nice at least
[2:09:11] <+Funky_Honkey> @Funky_Honkey still, my heart is blazing
[2:09:17] <bigshedman> Just got here, did Woolie talk about the differences between beta 1 and 2? If so, I'll catch the VOD.

[2:09:46] <someyounguy1> id love to know what openings you can have to bite when anji is going in
[2:09:53] <leith_aziz> wow, people lining up hard
[2:09:54] <andre11dr> Butterfly is definitely not as oppressing as it used to be
[2:10:07] <Applecannon63> Shitsu butterfly is very dumb
[2:10:08] <Pookiedaexzile> @glgzephyr Clone, Not raised in the same family, or  anything that equates to a technically is still a no on the incest tip son
[2:10:10] <DSD24> I wonder how cute May is gonna sound in English
[2:10:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> dash on circle
[2:10:24] <andre11dr> especially now that FB butterfly is gone
[2:10:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> reggie you mad man
[2:10:30] <+sonofthedeepsouth> You wrong mad man
[2:10:30] <Blank9> I'm pretty sure when anji's going in, you aren't totally stuck in blockstun after fujin
[2:10:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> I wish anji had a faster button outside of jab or just a better knockdown that wasn't grab or dp
[2:10:32] <+Hitorio> Yooo. Millia's hair looks so dope without the hat

[2:11:49] <Ardisan_> Ky is pretty MC guy
[2:11:52] <BlackermanZX> woolieMIRIN
[2:11:54] <Applecannon63> Seanchiplock is the best
[2:11:55] <+Your_Lord_and_Senpai> his voice is about what i expect
[2:11:57] <+KilogramHours> Kaiji Tang is Faust
[2:11:58] <%ChoculaUltra> I feel like I've heard this guy in a Trails game of some kind
[2:11:59] <%Josef_Stryker> I mean he even did fucking Noob Saibot
[2:12:00] <overkrustice> ENglish Ky is trash
[2:12:02] <Murdercles> they couldnt even get a frenchman to play Ky. zero effort
[2:12:03] <Sulliman34> is that command dash or her normal dash?
[2:12:05] <%slayabee> Trunks voices Ky in JP

[2:13:34] <DSD24> Tan Millia is best Millia
[2:13:34] <+sonofthedeepsouth> hubris Reggie hubris
[2:13:35] <%Josef_Stryker> It seems like they only ever bother with British accents and no other characters.

[2:16:38] <leith_aziz> @ianrspc Park is infinite rematch
[2:16:39] <Raven_In_A_Tree> You can tell its Tara because she has no range and always sounds the same
[2:16:41] <+LandOfTheWay> edelgard, mitsuru, and a few others i forget
[2:16:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Best of 3 just like the Ar-
[2:16:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn I'm old

[2:16:57] <Ardisan_> @Raven_In_A_Tree Harsh
[2:16:58] <DSD24> She was Zero in Drakengard 3
[2:17:00] <%Josef_Stryker> She's also Elizabeth in Persona
[2:17:01] <Pookiedaexzile> its setting in
[2:17:01] <+Hitorio> I remember when everyone thought Tara Platt and Yuri Lowenthall voiced 2B and 9S
[2:17:03] <%Eaglestrike117> Menitta i see you disrespectin the line
[2:17:11] <+Hitorio> Oh, riiight! Zero in Drakengard 3. She killed it as Zero
[2:17:17] <%Josef_Stryker> I mean JYB sounds the same all the time and he does a good job all the time with that voice
[2:17:21] <leith_aziz> @Josef_Stryker Wait really? I deff could not notice it was her
[2:17:26] <@Menitta> @Eaglestrike117 I WASNT TRYING TO

[2:17:46] <OldManDeckardCain> when is woolie gonna have his revenge vs pat now that "pot is dead"? Kappa
[2:17:48] <+Hitorio> Tara Platt pronounces her "S"s with a strong sharpness. It gave away a plot twist in one of the games she was in.
[2:17:50] <%LastHazzerd> bodies fall faster

[2:18:05] <%Josef_Stryker> Alot of VAs have more range than we expect. It's just that they're often typecast into roles that fit their usual voices.
[2:18:06] <%LastHazzerd> non-canon game
[2:18:07] <+Hitorio> Hear how Millia said "I guess" just now with that sharp S?

[2:21:28] <%gatorafan> @slayabee Not sure if liking 1 out of 7 voices so far is liking the dub, but okay.
[2:21:38] <%drefizz> @slayabee I prefer the JP voices but the dub ones aren't bad, except Sol
[2:21:39] <leith_aziz> @Josef_Stryker agreed. While I like the dub, I do not wanna listen to ENG Sol which is my main
[2:21:43] <Sulliman34> GOOD SHIT REGGIE
[2:21:46] <+Eaglestrike117> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:21:47] <MagumaDono> The gate's been breached!
[2:21:47] <DaKnightWarrior> Nice Reggie!
[2:21:48] <leith_aziz> Eyy. Reggie embracing having fun
[2:21:49] <BlackermanZX> that was insane
[2:21:49] <+sonofthedeepsouth> calp
[2:21:54] <LoneFonte> good shit
[2:21:54] <Yenwai> so faust is a zoner right?
[2:21:55] <PFlare> I'm liking a lot of these dub voices.
[2:21:58] <+sonofthedeepsouth> are made of these
[2:22:05] <+Hitorio> @Josef_Stryker I like how you say "slider" like we're adjusting their pitch and speed or something. :P
[2:22:11] <+Hitorio> That would be wild
[2:22:12] <DSD24> Man those shoes are size 18s
[2:22:14] <Sulliman34> miliia cant mix leo for SHIT since he has a flash kick
[2:22:16] <gunstars20> I enjoy the fact that they brought back Sign Sol LUL
[2:22:23] <+KilogramHours> Why does Faust have Among Us Drip Sneakers.
[2:22:23] <Ultimatefool> Yeah only dub voice that's weird is Sol, not deep enough
[2:22:24] <Picia000123> Yeah, Japanese dub is the way for me here
[2:22:25] <Quikanims> i actually liked faust better when he didn't have a voice
[2:22:25] <Sulliman34> AFRO COMBOS
[2:22:31] <BlackermanZX> HE MAD

[2:22:37] <%BestTeaMaker> P'd on
[2:22:37] <%Josef_Stryker> Sol needed his voice to be a tad deeper
[2:22:38] <andre11dr> The Faust problem with every new game is learning what every item does and what do they look like
[2:22:39] <DSD24> Look at these hands

[2:23:18] <Applecannon63> DON'T RUN
[2:23:18] <+NightNiix> What happened to vampire samurai?
[2:23:18] <PFlare> ...He had a voice in this game, too. It was just quiet.

[2:28:37] <%Eaglestrike117> If you're talking about I-no, her english VA is Android 18 in DBZ abridged
[2:28:37] <%gatorafan> @leith_aziz You would have known this if you watched the videos. FAKE FAN Kappa
[2:28:38] <Sulliman34> 6HS
[2:28:39] <DaKnightWarrior> Best theme SingsNote lytMOTIVATED SingsNote
[2:28:40] <MagumaDono> No Alpha Blade
[2:28:44] <+Hitorio> You're not an anime unless you have a loud ninja.
[2:28:45] <%ChoculaUltra> I think Chipp's dub isn't bad at all. Just as loud/cheesy as the JP dub.
[2:28:47] <Asuterisuku> But of course Chipp Can't Kill
[2:28:47] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I miss engrish Alpha blade
[2:28:53] <ohno778> Sandals are wack tho
[2:28:55] <andre11dr> God dam ,Chipp melts so hard
[2:28:55] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Thats what I meant!
[2:28:56] <g0d_zill4> Chipp without Engrish just sounds wrong to me
[2:29:10] <FassieFons> SourPls oh shit
[2:29:15] <velgaduere> @ohno778 he's a ninja homie
[2:29:16] <CupsCommander> Was Chipp always able to TK alpha blade? I was getting schmixed by that earlier.
[2:29:16] <scrublord009> Don't know the lore. But listen all of Daisukes musical inspirations
[2:29:21] <deviljhojho_> oh fuck yeah
[2:29:22] <%drefizz> yeah chipp without engrish is the problem
[2:29:22] <PFlare> YOO
[2:29:23] <DSD24> Sick
[2:29:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> yo
[2:29:24] <+Hitorio> Remember when the English Dub turned JP Mitsuru's English into French to keep the exotic feel?
[2:29:24] <LoneFonte> OOOOOOOOH
[2:29:25] <leith_aziz> Chipp is good in ENG. You just cant beat his Engrish, which is the issue
[2:29:26] <%Josef_Stryker> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:29:26] <PFlare> FIGHT LIKE A TIGER
[2:29:27] <+Byr0nX> OOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:29:28] <DaKnightWarrior> Good stuff
[2:29:28] <Dr_Mooose> oooo ok ok
[2:29:28] <%ChoculaUltra> now it would be hilarious if he did all the moves in Japanese but with a really over the top American accent/bad pronounciation
[2:29:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> YOO
[2:29:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> KILLERS
[2:29:32] <%Eaglestrike117> CHIP ACTIVATED

[2:29:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:29:49] <+Hitorio> @ChoculaUltra Weeaboo Chipp?
[2:29:54] <Cavumentum> @ChoculaUltra Axl actually has some moves with the japanese names in the thick bri'ish accent
[2:29:57] <deviljhojho_> my man's got the defense of a tissue
[2:29:58] <leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra normal Chip?
[2:30:00] <+takotoots> Clap
[2:30:01] <andre11dr> Chipp is kinda missing those teleports isn't he ?
[2:30:03] <Sulliman34> oh yeah where is answer from again
[2:30:04] <MagumaDono> @Menitta how far back is it?
[2:30:04] <Pookiedaexzile> I don't think its teh Engrish I think its the energy he screams with
[2:30:05] <Yenwai> i gotta go soon so i guess ill ask my main question with a highlight and see if i get lucky :)
[2:30:06] <LoneFonte> pressing buttons
[2:30:08] <deviljhojho_> die like a tiger
[2:30:10] <Pookiedaexzile> He needs more
[2:30:18] <%jepupu> 6H -> Alpha blade man
[2:30:18] <Yenwai> Hey Woolie, is Bloody roar 4 dead/bad? should i look for a different game to get into?
[2:30:21] <Demicrim> god chipp's strive design is so much better, he does not look like a meth addict anymore
[2:30:28] <DaKnightWarrior> Magic Powder
[2:30:28] <Ardisan_> Chipp is american so I prefer him in dub. Not a engrish fan personally.
[2:30:30] <WakeUpThrow> Chipp's electrochem was off the rails back then
[2:30:30] <leith_aziz> Drugs are drugs Woolie. They leave something
[2:30:36] <MagumaDono> @Yenwai Bloody Roar is always worth getting into
[2:30:37] <DSD24> Bloody Roar Primal Fury is a lot better dood
[2:30:39] <Asuterisuku> Play 3/Primal Fury instead.
[2:30:41] <deviljhojho_> 12 electrochem to 1 electrochem
[2:30:43] <DSD24> 4 isn't as good sadly
[2:30:47] <MagumaDono> And yes, Primal Fury
[2:30:53] <deviljhojho_> "havent lost yet"
[2:30:53] <@Menitta> @MagumaDono touching two battle stations back from the one Woolie is at
[2:30:57] <+Hitorio> Guilty Gear Strive and Tekken 7 are a couple games that I've seen kill it in terms of sequel re-designs.
[2:30:58] <andre11dr> @demicrim I mean ,he was one tho
[2:31:01] <MagumaDono> @Menitta daamn
[2:31:02] <PFlare> Dude isn't using his rekkas.
[2:31:08] <%Irridium> I wish more games would do what street fighter does and let you pick languages based on character rather than blanket english/japanese for the whole cast
[2:31:09] <MagumaDono> I'm glad I got in line early @A@
[2:31:13] <@Menitta> and there's a big gap between em lmao
[2:31:18] <leith_aziz> Man, I would love to watch more, but I gotta prep for sleep. Enjoy the stream everybody!
[2:31:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Chipp should have the energy of American Cuno
[2:31:20] <DSD24> Beta Blade sounds great
[2:31:25] <+takotoots> gg
[2:31:27] <Asuterisuku> @Irridium Yeah, that is a cool overlooked feature.
[2:31:27] <$GuardlyGuard> Give him the CHOP
[2:31:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> gg no re
[2:31:30] <PFlare> No Johns.
[2:31:33] <NotHereToStream> chipp didn't have enough nose candy
[2:31:35] <DaKnightWarrior> Luck is a skill Kappa
[2:31:38] <DSD24> The fuck does Chipp think about Anti Airs!
[2:31:40] <Ardisan_> Nago best dad
[2:31:40] <+The_Devil_Breaker> Not gonna lie, that corner pressure was sick
[2:31:42] <g0d_zill4> @Hitorio SF V can be hit or miss, but I love Bison and juri's redesigns
[2:31:42] <%gatorafan> @Pookiedaexzile Chipp is a FUCKING MONK
[2:31:48] <+RXSkyed> Nagos dubs is so good
[2:32:02] <%Eaglestrike117> FUCK YOU ITS ROCK HOWARD
[2:32:03] <overkrustice> Where is the May
[2:32:04] <deviljhojho_> Nago does have a solid dub voice
[2:32:07] <bigshedman> Nago is one of the biggest winners in the dub
[2:32:08] <DSD24> Eagle from Granblue
[2:32:13] <Ardisan_> Nobody playing May
[2:32:13] <MagumaDono> Oh shit that's clean
[2:32:14] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:32:18] <+Hitorio> @Hitorio I don't recall Bison's design changes, though I find Juri's pretty dope. I do kinda miss her baggy pants and exposed midriff, though; they look dope when she kicks.
[2:32:23] <%drefizz> yeah nago got the best voice
[2:32:29] <andre11dr> @dsd24 I saw a Chipp getting anti aird for half his life
[2:32:32] <OkamiDude15> chip doesnt die in one from the blood mode super if he does that one move
[2:32:34] <%drefizz> with Sol getting the worst LUL
[2:32:34] <leith_aziz> Hitorio: Strive's redesigns in my opinion are 10/10 across the board. Buff Chipp is the only one I dislike
[2:32:40] <ianrspc> I'm just glad I got that one match in
[2:32:46] <DSD24> @andre11dr That's why I can see him saying it
[2:32:52] <Pookiedaexzile> I don't like Chipps neck thing
[2:32:53] <ianrspc> I got one win good enough lol
[2:32:56] <+takotoots> Oooooo
[2:32:59] <Ardisan_> I prefer SF4 Juri design. Glad they have Nostalgia costumes. More Fighting games should do nostalgia costumes
[2:32:59] <Demicrim> out of the eng voices, zato is the best one I feel\
[2:33:00] <leith_aziz> @Hitorio : Strive's redesigns in my opinion are 10/10 across the board. Buff Chipp is the only one I dislike. Missed the marker at the end whoops

[2:35:22] <%drefizz> Nah Nago isn't voiced by the Arby's guy
[2:35:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Zappa will always bee the least used
[2:35:30] <%drefizz> but he sounds like em
[2:35:33] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @drefizz Awww
[2:35:35] <GlaceonYo> Disappointing. With more training, Arby's may have hired you.
[2:35:37] <leith_aziz> best of both worlds
[2:35:45] <overkrustice> The best setting is delete the dub
[2:35:46] <SkylarkJ> @LandOfTheWay Really, that's a good nod to the old meme

[2:36:01] <+Hitorio> @GlaceonYo This is how Arby's interviews employees nowadays?
[2:36:02] <+LandOfTheWay> bbtag did that, and thank god for it
[2:36:03] <DSD24> Is it Ram time?
[2:36:05] <+mental_mashup> Nago mains get a free roast beef sandwich at participating Arby’s locations
[2:36:08] <+NightNiix> damn I hate the lobby
[2:36:11] <leith_aziz> Cant beat Cell's ENG

[2:36:24] <%drefizz> I grew to like grandma goku overtime
[2:36:26] <stormhawk9891> Oh boy
[2:36:29] <+not_crabby> thats a big ass line
[2:36:35] <PFlare> Might not be in the chat.
[2:36:40] <%drefizz> Cells JP voice is pretty good actually
[2:36:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:36:44] <CupsCommander> I'm getting errors, Ill let someone else go
[2:36:47] <andre11dr> English Cell is awesome as well
[2:36:48] <%Josef_Stryker> Grandma Goku Black is better than English Goku Black imo
[2:36:55] <DSD24> Is Cell in JP Norio?
[2:36:56] <Pookiedaexzile> No one in the chat "likes" grandma goku, if you do I demand to see your dragonball subs
[2:36:56] <leith_aziz> @drefizz I respect the actress. but I think ENG Goku fits better, my feeling on the actor aside
[2:37:02] <VJdarkworld> Sadge
[2:37:02] <%Josef_Stryker> Yeah it's Wakamoto
[2:37:03] <Ultimatefool> They just found a line and joined LUL
[2:37:04] <%drefizz> @Josef_Stryker you're just stating facts
[2:37:06] <+Hitorio> Sean Schemmel's voice still sounds the same, which I like. Sabat's Vegeta voice seems to have morphed/mutated over the years.
[2:37:13] <DSD24> Awww no Ram
[2:37:13] <overkrustice> Can we get some mays in the house
[2:37:14] <leith_aziz> @Josef_Stryker "Subarashi"

[2:37:20] <+storkeylope> Im fine with grandma goku, i just wish like a quarter of the characters weren't voiced by grandma goku
[2:37:22] <bobxmaker> there's an actual line?

[2:38:11] <leith_aziz> *stream
[2:38:12] <stormhawk9891> My problem with Granny Goku is that she also voices pretty much every other member of his family
[2:38:15] <@Menitta> Yo
[2:38:15] <+Hitorio> @leith_aziz Have a nice... unconsciousness.
[2:38:16] <%drefizz> Grandma Guilmon
[2:38:16] <SpookyBeef7> For the people at the end of the line, would it be possible to kind of loop it on the ground and back the other direction so that it's not blocking the other stations?
[2:38:18] <Demicrim> These
[2:38:23] <Blackscience91> Kept getting error messages

[2:38:39] <DaKnightWarrior> My gosh this lobby man.
[2:38:39] <Pookiedaexzile> DBZF fans saying they can put up with grandma goku is like a person in 2 inch water making fun of people drowning. try watching that shit for 4 hours

[2:39:08] <FlowLethal> pot got done dirty
[2:39:08] <+Shishi1205> This is minus on hit Megafist
[2:39:09] <+not_crabby> its pretty negative
[2:39:12] <bigshedman> English Pot let's go LUL
[2:39:12] <primaryfire> yeah about -9
[2:39:12] <@Menitta> I got ABSOLUTELY BODIED by a Pot last night.
[2:39:13] <%drefizz> @Pookiedaexzile I watched all of super in subs, fight me
[2:39:14] <stormhawk9891> @MagumaDono You promised Heavenly Pot Busters
[2:39:16] <overkrustice> @Pookiedaexzile I watch all of dragon ball subbed though

[2:39:44] <primaryfire> octo is streaming if you wanna reach out for some spirit breaking
[2:39:46] <OkamiDude15> @eldragon_1 people hated the cabs and it was only when it was taken away that they realized it was okay actually
[2:39:47] <+Shishi1205> Hitting someone with megafist then getting hit first is super strange
[2:39:49] <%Irridium> it's fun fighting pot as axl you get him in a corner and just poke until he charges, then punish and send him right back again
[2:39:53] <DSD24> He sounds good
[2:39:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Pookiedaexzile good lord
[2:39:58] <WakeUpThrow> Huh,was expecting Pot's voice to sound like thunder
[2:39:59] <PFlare> Yeah, Pot sounds nice.
[2:40:01] <Pookiedaexzile> I sure you sub watchers really "listened"  with the sound on 0 bumping night core anime openings
[2:40:03] <Supabait> monkaS
[2:40:08] <PFlare> I dunno why people are freaking.
[2:40:12] <%Josef_Stryker> He needs to be just a tad deeper for it to work.
[2:40:17] <andre11dr> It is nice that DP doesn't just lose to his but now, it was bullshit before
[2:40:22] <primaryfire> heay j.HS doesn't crossup anymore
[2:40:23] <DSD24> The read!
[2:40:23] <bigshedman> @WakeUpThrow Right? Pot sounds so fucking bored compared to his JP voice. Pot Buster sounds terrible.
[2:40:24] <LoneFonte> LMAOOOO
[2:40:24] <$razielhex> stage transition
[2:40:28] <+Shishi1205> Air dust baby
[2:40:29] <%drefizz> hmmm the voice isn't bad but its missing the Oomph oh the JP voice's Pot
[2:40:35] <+takotoots> Clap
[2:40:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I don't know what you talking about Pot was always balanced and fair Kappa
[2:40:38] <%justmildlilac> Something about English Pot feels...off.
[2:40:46] <+Hitorio> Maybe a more fitting Potemkin voice would be the English Dub Tobi "Madara"
[2:40:49] <$razielhex> hair like that would be paralyzingly heavy
[2:40:52] <Supabait> when enemy pot is on the screen its an automatic -10 to mental fortitude
[2:40:52] <+Hitorio> which was deep and rich
[2:40:57] <DSD24> @justmildlilac Is it Megafist?
[2:41:05] <andre11dr> Dub Pot just doesn't sound deep enough
[2:41:12] <%justmildlilac> I agree
[2:41:15] <Pookiedaexzile> English Pot doesn't sound huge he sounds like his mouth is full
[2:41:16] <%drefizz> JP Pot's balls just hang lower
[2:41:18] <%Josef_Stryker> Who voiced Tobi when he was pretending to be Madara?
[2:41:24] <+Hitorio> Why did Potemkin's six-pack abs just ripple like Rufus?
[2:41:25] <bruuzer12> is it weird to think that Leo's VO would be better for Potemkin?
[2:41:31] <SkylarkJ> Ky should say "OH NO, I'M FALLING!" when he gets wall break
[2:41:32] <%ChoculaUltra> wait, is dub Pot also dub Tager
[2:41:37] <%justmildlilac> He needs more bass to the voice and more energy
[2:41:42] <stormhawk9891> @ChoculaUltra No that's Leo
[2:41:47] <%ChoculaUltra> ah kk
[2:41:53] <OkamiDude15> @SkylarkJ he says IM FALLING when he gets sweeped
[2:41:55] <ElPlasa> @SkylarkJ He says "Im falling" when he gets knocked down
[2:41:57] <+Teelor32> @SkylarkJ he actually says it when he gets knocked down, he says "I'm falling"
[2:42:01] <%justmildlilac> @skylarkj Funny you say that, that's a line he says when he's sweeped
[2:42:11] <SkylarkJ> Nice
[2:42:14] <+Hitorio> @ChoculaUltra Dub Tager is Papa Nier and Sojiro Sakura - if that helps you subconsciously identify.
[2:42:16] <andre11dr> dub pot should be some Disco Elysium narrator level of ball lowness
[2:42:17] <Supabait> is he using super to de-corner himself?
[2:42:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> accept his warm embrace reggie

[2:43:58] <PFlare> @WakeUpThrow Yeah, he has a variant of the line that's a lot less epic, though. People might've heard that and not THIS one.
[2:44:04] <user_naim> NEGATIVE BONUS
[2:44:10] <+LandOfTheWay> someone clip that megafist pls
[2:44:11] <Jediforce317> There are like 3 different reads of HPB in the dub
[2:44:17] <+Hitorio> @Ardisan_ I just generally mean small legs and huge stronk body. Pot has a lot more muscle definition than the One Piece tubemen, though. :P

[2:46:47] <+justmildlilac> This is lowkey my fav Ram color
[2:46:48] <+Shishi1205> You have to jump heavy mob now
[2:46:55] <Nekros4442> Sign of a panicking Ram is if they throw their swords randomly
[2:47:02] <Ardisan_> I want to play Ram but I have a fixed mentality to not go to extremely popular waifu
[2:47:03] <Dave_VD> Yo reggie
[2:47:04] <+Hitorio> Mint Chocolate Girl Scout Ramlethal

[2:47:41] <andre11dr> I still strongly believe that Ran is top 3 at least
[2:47:44] <Nekros4442> meterless "wall break"
[2:47:49] <+Hitorio> @Ardisan_ How was this mental barrier formed?
[2:47:55] <%drefizz> You guys reminded me I bought chocolate from the candy story earlier woolieCHAN

[2:50:01] <%drefizz> it got real quiet and I couldn't hear it over my fan
[2:50:01] <+Hitorio> PlatinumGames is where the Ass Men are, and Arc System Works is where the Hips and Thighs Men are.
[2:50:03] <Supabait> where is the music from Ram's reveal trailer moon2A
[2:50:18] <stormhawk9891> @Menitta Lol

[2:52:02] <DSD24> That was sick Woolie
[2:52:17] <andre11dr> I used to not like this theme but it grew a lot on me
[2:52:19] <+Hitorio> @drefizz I tell you this. If Platinum ever finished their development on Granblue ReLink, Granblue would suddenly become not meh to me. :P
[2:52:22] <Ardisan_> OKAY MAI NO MAY
[2:52:22] <+gitgouda> feels good
[2:52:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> cmon chipp

[2:53:01] <stonestring93> jesus, he's so cool
[2:53:02] <SkylarkJ> Is Alpha Blade the new teleport for Chipp now?
[2:53:03] <%Akizea> platinum finished their part of the contract
[2:53:03] <muXPerience> oh damn, it's really working for woolz, innit
[2:53:03] <%drefizz> but thats up to sega...
[2:53:05] <+VCRUZZO> @drefizz for real
[2:53:05] <andre11dr> I like how it's a wierd punky song instead of metal all the time
[2:53:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Hot take: Chipp should sound like and have the energy of Ichiban
[2:53:14] <+Hitorio> @Akizea I mean actually develop the whole game rather than do a portion of development then pass it on.
[2:53:20] <MagumaDono> @Menitta, wanna play???
[2:53:21] <+VCRUZZO> that would be dope
[2:53:33] <@Menitta> Ye!

[2:54:01] <stormhawk9891> @Menitta ggs
[2:54:07] <%drefizz> I miss Anarchy Reigns, its literally my favorite game of all time
[2:54:08] <dontfeedthechocobo> watching chipp go ham is so much fun
[2:54:11] <LoneFonte> WOOOOOOOOOW
[2:54:23] <+Hitorio> Anarchy Reigns would have a more robust cast nowadays. We got Akira Howard, Raiden, Sam from Vanquish, Bayo of course
[2:54:28] <DSD24> @drefizz Man I miss playing that game too
[2:54:46] <DSD24> Big Bull was my shit!
[2:54:47] <%drefizz> We need to ask Sega

[2:55:11] <velgaduere> okay
[2:55:12] <Ardisan_> I dont want to be a ninja
[2:55:13] <velgaduere> LUL
[2:55:15] <Saltmeisterr> no :)
[2:55:15] <Ardisan_> Samurai cooler
[2:55:18] <Jontman42> just go and ninja
[2:55:19] <%CalderGaming> you heard the man
[2:55:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:55:20] <anarchistPastry> "GO HOME AND BE A NINJA"
[2:55:21] <%drefizz> @andre11dr yeah sadly that and Madworld got poor sales but were great games
[2:55:22] <DaKnightWarrior> No, i wanna be a Samurai.
[2:55:23] <DSD24> Felt like that had a extra line
[2:55:24] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[2:55:34] <user_naim> Really Chipp?
[2:55:36] <+LandOfTheWay> Go home and be a family ninja!
[2:55:43] <+Hitorio> @Akizea From what I've heard, the remnants of their design decisions got scrapped even though the superficialities look the same.
[2:55:46] <Treyu000> weeb ninja vs weeb samurai
[2:55:49] <Sulliman34> yknow what would be cool? getting chipp's master as a skin/character
[2:55:52] <MagumaDono> @Menita plz
[2:55:55] <@Menitta> OH MY GOD
[2:56:02] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:56:14] <MagumaDono> clipped
[2:56:20] <stormhawk9891> @MagumaDono I'll take you next if you're fine with that
[2:56:30] <DSD24> Get away from me is such a good line
[2:56:32] <+Hitorio> @Akizea Though I'll still check out ReLink upon release. If I dig how it looks, I'll cop it. :D
[2:56:33] <%drefizz> @Sulliman34 skins are too difficult for the way Arcsys does the models so they'd have to make the character from scratch
[2:56:35] <andre11dr> @drefizz The Platinum curse ,make amazing game, market it like shit so people think it's a different bad game
[2:56:45] <DSD24> Shishou!
[2:56:45] <aka_Jigawatt> y no punish :/
[2:56:46] <Nikbottom> Gigs hot da
[2:56:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> 2-1
[2:56:48] <Supabait> 2-1
[2:56:48] <Sulliman34> @drefizz aaaah thats true, the price paid for beauty
[2:56:52] <%LastHazzerd> Ninja Vs Samurai
[2:56:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this is the ultimate weeb vs weeb matchup
[2:56:55] <Ardisan_> Youre not a dad
[2:56:55] <%Sparkseid> 2-1
[2:56:57] <EnderGamma> it's bottom right if you ever forget score
[2:56:59] <Pookiedaexzile> They don't need Skins, They need custom colors
[2:57:06] <andre11dr> Luckily Nier Platinum has gotten better at selling
[2:57:07] <%Akizea> @hitorio  hmmmm fair but honestly at the end of the day then if the platinum combat is there then it is what it is
[2:57:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Let me change just teh shoes, or eyebrows
[2:57:13] <+Hitorio> Bayonetta 3's marketing has been fire so far
[2:57:15] <Ardisan_> I miss custom colors in Fighting Games
[2:57:24] <Saltmeisterr> have we gotten leo yet chat?
[2:57:26] <+Hitorio> Kappa
[2:57:26] <DSD24> I wonder who he plays
[2:57:28] <Pookiedaexzile> They know they have the engine for that
[2:57:34] <Supabait> sol player PogChamp time to unga bunga

[2:57:52] <Pyrrhus90> LUL
[2:57:53] <%Major_Lee_> Sol Dante
[2:57:54] <Sulliman34> yeah wild throw just got straight nerfed, sad
[2:57:56] <+Hitorio> @Akizea Indeed. There's a chance it could even be improved. That'd be dope
[2:57:57] <DSD24> Get in
[2:58:01] <andre11dr> Heavy Mob is way more useful now i find
[2:58:01] <VJdarkworld> @hitorio fyi platinum was only contracted to do a small part of relink. their contract ended, and thats why it was 'passed on'
[2:58:03] <%Zero_Jacks> lytJACKPOT
[2:58:04] <+LandOfTheWay> HMC => HMC => jab
[2:58:06] <Sulliman34> did sol just do 5P > 2P > 6HS?
[2:58:07] <PFlare> Someone explained this before: this voice is better on Sol back in the XX days. Thin Sol.
[2:58:16] <Sulliman34> THE WHIFF

[2:58:19] <+Shishi1205> I have to hear Tyrant Rave
[2:58:31] <Picia000123> It's kinda wild how nobody is punishing blood burst LUL
[2:58:31] <Ardisan_> Use not Vortex so I can hear other lines
[2:58:49] <+Hitorio> @VJdarkworld Ah, so they were only supposed to do a small part of it to begin with. Hmmm.
[2:58:49] <+VCRUZZO> @Picia000123 right?
[2:58:51] <%CalderGaming> baaAAAAndiit...
[2:58:54] <Peyote_> lmao that bandit
[2:58:57] <bigshedman> That Gunflame line LUL
[2:58:57] <velgaduere> @Ardisan_ idk if you want that man
[2:58:57] <DSD24> Gun Flame!
[2:59:03] <+Hitorio> @VJdarkworld When this game nears release, I'll be interested in researching its development.
[2:59:04] <+Shishi1205> Gunflame sounds sick but man JP sol Is way too much
[2:59:04] <%drefizz> voice is too light LUL
[2:59:08] <%Akizea> @hitorio yeah I shoulda said that at the start lol
[2:59:08] <anarchistPastry> Gun Flaaame~!
[2:59:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hm yeah, Sol's dub voice is a bit miss
[2:59:09] <+LandOfTheWay> don't mind sol's VA, but one of his bandi bringer line reads is weird
[2:59:13] <zecht89> Man that voice does NOT suit Sol at all
[2:59:15] <%averyoddjew> HOLY SHIT THIS GAME HAS STAGE TRANSITIONS?!
[2:59:16] <WakeUpThrow> First voice I'm actually really not feeling
[2:59:22] <+Superbro64> Sol's dub is the same as Xrd methinks
[2:59:27] <nolifegamin> I'm not into Sol's English voice
[2:59:34] <%Major_Lee_> Its hard to beat original Sol
[2:59:34] <TheAzureOracle> Not deep enough
[2:59:37] <+LandOfTheWay> @superbro64 yeah, same VA
[2:59:37] <TheAzureOracle> NEEDS TO BE MORE DEEP
[2:59:38] <Saltmeisterr> ye same here
[2:59:38] <%Stonesoul_> the english dubs mostly feel.... off to me
[2:59:45] <%DomPressesButtons> @Superbro64 i think so too
[2:59:48] <stormhawk9891> @Superbro64 It is, David Forseth
[2:59:54] <Icer107> @averyoddjew yeah, all stages have two "stages", I think?
[2:59:59] <andre11dr> It's funny that XX Sol is just known as skinny Sol ,he was still one of the more beefier caracters in XX,but compared to roids in my teeth over here...
[3:00:01] <MechNexus> I like the random painter in the background not paying any mind to the fight
[3:00:03] <%drefizz> Nago and Faust are the best of the Eng voices
[3:00:05] <MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[3:00:07] <+Hitorio> @averyoddjew Memorize this smell you're smelling right now.
[3:00:10] <Sulliman34> i REALLY like nago's 2S, feels a lot like leo's old 2S
[3:00:13] <%LastHazzerd> as someone who hasn't given GG much attention for years, i have no issue with any of the dubs
[3:00:16] <VJdarkworld> @hitorio yeh, idk if its in development hell or not... they prob shoulda just contracted plat to do full game LUL
[3:00:20] <DSD24> So close
[3:00:22] <+Shishi1205> That sounds low
[3:00:23] <user_naim> Aren’t there always three stages?

[3:00:40] <LoneFonte> I like how you can hear the *clank* of the mask on the bite whiff
[3:00:54] <+Chronor655> Nago feels like SO much work!
[3:01:13] <DSD24> Wow
[3:01:18] <andre11dr> Nago is still a lot of damage tho
[3:01:19] <Sulliman34> did he say "Bad move!" when he prc'ed?
[3:01:23] <+VCRUZZO> that coulda been real nice
[3:01:24] <Saltmeisterr> its kinda crazy how the dub va's had to do only one take for most of the lines
[3:01:28] <%drefizz> Yeah cause Nago is for big Brain samurai masters
[3:01:29] <Ardisan_> Whose the most unga rn
[3:01:39] <DSD24> Sol
[3:01:40] <+Chronor655> Leo
[3:01:44] <+sonofthedeepsouth> oof
[3:01:44] <WakeUpThrow> Chat, you guys know who's the VA? He sounds very familiar
[3:01:47] <stormhawk9891> @Ardisan_ Leo
[3:01:47] <%LastHazzerd> just above the hitbox
[3:01:50] <Pookiedaexzile> I feel like the dub vs sub thing is titled when it comes to the girls on the cast, some dudes just can't let go of tiny JVA's screeching in a artificially heighted voice so nothing a EVA can do
[3:01:53] <+Shishi1205> Leo then Sol then Anji
[3:02:00] <BackwardCap> Its like they casted for "Teenage Sol" when hes a grown ass man.
[3:02:10] <SkylarkJ> What is that Gunflame voice?
[3:02:21] <zecht89> nope, that just sounds bad
[3:02:23] <DSD24> Guess he's talking about Slayer?
[3:02:25] <%LastHazzerd> how tf does this sound like a teenager!?
[3:02:32] <%LastHazzerd> have you heard a teenager recently?
[3:02:33] <andre11dr> I kinda see him similar to a caracter like ABA if things are going your way you'll melt your enemy, but if not, you'll melt yourself
[3:02:33] <stonestring93> "Bandeet!"
[3:02:35] <Ardisan_> Sol is the only voice here I dont like :(
[3:02:36] <+Shishi1205> Yeah old man is slayer
[3:02:37] <MagumaDono> @Menitta, one more?\
[3:02:38] <%Juriasu> Sols japanese voice is so deep, this voice just makes him sound like a normal guy
[3:02:41] <@Menitta> Ye sure
[3:02:47] <user_naim> That strand of hair presses against Sol’s nose would feel so irritating
[3:02:49] <gunstars20> What kinda teen sounds like that? WutFace
[3:02:53] <Saltmeisterr> @andre11dr aba had better mobility tho
[3:02:56] <+FuqBoiSlim> uh oh
[3:03:01] <%drefizz> @Juriasu cause Sol's JP VA's balls literally touch the ground
[3:03:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> rollback save us
[3:03:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Teenagers tend to think anyone who sounds close to them sounds "too young"
[3:03:07] <Ardisan_> I met a teenage in highschool that sounded like Morgan Freeman, no cap
[3:03:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I like the girl in the background is like"Look at all the cool shit happening behind us honey!"
[3:03:23] <@Menitta> OH NO
[3:03:36] <+Hitorio> @sonofthedeepsouth "That's nice, dear."
[3:03:39] <DaKnightWarrior> That woman in the back is the only person like OH SNAP A FIGHT!
[3:03:40] <velgaduere> saw that shit comin a MILE away
[3:03:40] <+FuqBoiSlim> that's tuff
[3:03:41] <Quikanims> i feel like this Sol VA would make a much better Wolverine
[3:03:41] <+VCRUZZO> oh
[3:03:42] <%Deft_Thought> Have y'all seen the "Rev 0" Xrd mod? It's like GG Rainbow Edition. Looks wild.
[3:03:44] <DSD24> I gotta get my bird watching on Sweetie
[3:03:45] <%jepupu> Damn those frames on Sol
[3:03:46] <andre11dr> Ah almost
[3:03:48] <%LastHazzerd> true that some teens have voices deeper than blue whales
[3:03:48] <user_naim> @sonofthedeepsouth the only one who cares in like all the stages
[3:03:57] <%Juriasu> Nago's voice though is pretty sick
[3:04:00] <nolifegamin> I love that Nago super so much, never gets old
[3:04:01] <+Chronor655> Yo the Q
[3:04:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Normal adult men don't all sound like Kratos
[3:04:05] <+Teelor32> goddamn, G fucking G, i was so nervous
[3:04:06] <+Hitorio> I'll take pride, Nagoriyuki. I'mma keep doin' mah BESS

[3:06:09] <@Menitta> And jump less. It felt like I got punished for jumping a lot
[3:06:11] <+Hitorio> Imagine if they sold a cologne line called The Smell of the Game
[3:06:12] <MagumaDono> I feel that
[3:06:18] <MagumaDono> Yeah the jumping is something I kind of snipe at
[3:06:25] <MagumaDono> That's why I you got HPB'd twice lmao
[3:06:37] <andre11dr> Yoy know Anji had a bad time when it was just 4
[3:06:38] <+Shishi1205> A perfect?
[3:06:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Smell of the Game: Resident Evil Collection
[3:06:49] <+Shishi1205> Almost
[3:06:50] <@Menitta> That first round was spicy lmao
[3:06:52] <+Hitorio> Imagine every character profile having a scratch-off section that let you know how they smelled.
[3:06:55] <MagumaDono> Definitely!
[3:06:58] <+Shishi1205> 4
[3:06:58] <%LastHazzerd> LUL

[3:07:34] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio Imagine Fausts smell, and how overused all teh girl ones would be
[3:07:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Anji won't weasel himself out of this one, Woolie is fighting for girls
[3:08:02] <Ardisan_> Baiken prob smells like goblin bath water
[3:08:16] <andre11dr> We all know Anji is woolieGIRLS
[3:08:17] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile "Scientists discover methods to perfectly replicate the bath water of anime characters"
[3:08:27] <velgaduere> @Ardisan_ bro what
[3:08:34] <Ardisan_> wym
[3:08:43] <velgaduere> no wYm
[3:08:44] <andre11dr> @ardisan_ I mean maybe
[3:08:44] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I bet Zato smells nice he seems the type
[3:08:45] <Saltmeisterr> Oh shit its a gio
[3:08:50] <WakeUpThrow> Isn't Baiken a murder hobo? She would probably smell like blood and sweat
[3:09:06] <+daddysbelthurts> @Hitorio the one time Science has gone just far enough
[3:09:13] <+Hitorio> According to One Piece canon, Sanji smells like seafood and cigarette smoke. Luffy smells like meat. Nami smells like [a fruit similar to tangerines]
[3:09:16] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm good on the bathwater, hows Rams inner thigh sweat coming along @Hitorio
[3:09:26] <+Hitorio> Luffy and Zoro bathe once a week. Sanji bathes every day.
[3:09:27] <andre11dr> Yeah Biken is a wondering hobo that doesn't seem to care about washing
[3:09:36] <Picia000123> this lobby NotLikeThis
[3:09:47] <DSD24> Giovanna time?
[3:09:57] <+VCRUZZO> @Pookiedaexzile How does one invest in this research?
[3:09:59] <overkrustice> Baikens bath water would be so concentrated, more of a broth
[3:10:04] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile We first need to simulate Ramlethal's skin type and diet.
[3:10:15] <+Hitorio> Cheezborger go into science lab
[3:10:17] <DSD24> This is real specific
[3:10:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Shark and People?
[3:10:27] <@Menitta> Glad I got some matches in this Beta. Strive is still fun as hell
[3:10:32] <DSD24> Wait doesn't Ram love hamburgers or something
[3:10:40] <+pupil31> That line up LOL
[3:10:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Burgers is vague as hell
[3:10:49] <+Hitorio> @overkrustice A broth. Holy fuck.
[3:10:50] <Demicrim> these lobbies will probably never get fixed banyaRip
[3:10:51] <Pookiedaexzile> could be people
[3:10:53] <andre11dr> Does Ran sweat, isn't she a Gear? do Gears sweat?
[3:10:53] <Saltmeisterr> this is fucking rough man

[3:11:06] <+pupil31> Single file people LUL
[3:11:07] <andre11dr> Why am i asking this
[3:11:10] <TheAzureOracle> The one above is free
[3:11:19] <deviljhojho_> @andre11dr its too late
[3:11:30] <DSD24> Yay English Gio time
[3:11:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> time to hear Gio
[3:11:34] <+Hitorio> In order to simulate the smell of Ramlethal's feet, we need samples of every surface she walks upon in the Guilty Gear world. Thus, Ramlethal's Feet Scents would be the most expensive commodity.
[3:11:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Did Gio get more interesting?
[3:11:42] <%justmildlilac> English Gio is based
[3:11:44] <Pookiedaexzile> No one said anything about Feet
[3:11:49] <Applecannon63> Ram is a machine made of meta data so she smells like knowlege
[3:11:50] <DaKnightWarrior> Dub Gio is super good.
[3:11:56] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile ....yet.
[3:11:59] <Pookiedaexzile> INNER Thigh, we aren't heathens

[3:14:03] <%gatorafan> @Shishi1205 Iguazu goes across like three countries. But yeah, she's Brazillian.
[3:14:05] <andre11dr> Yes Brazilian is Portuguese
[3:14:06] <stonestring93> They speak portuguese in Brazil

[3:17:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @DrJamesWoods nope
[3:17:20] <+Hitorio> Oh, lawd. The new Melty Blood could very well become my favorite modern fighting game.
[3:17:22] <%LastHazzerd> gettin' hit by her spiral arrow

[3:18:27] <deviljhojho_> its one of those brazilian dogs
[3:18:31] <fmbboaventura> @TheVoltStrike Probably. Cut it could be a reference to the brazilian city of the same name
[3:18:34] <+Shishi1205> Dogs can purr
[3:18:34] <deviljhojho_> the purring kind
[3:18:34] <Saltmeisterr> cmon leo
[3:18:35] <+Hitorio> This new Melty Blood looks like UNIST, but I imagine it'll be more aerial focused

[3:21:20] <overkrustice> I'm 6 years older
[3:21:23] <deviljhojho_> i suppose a good netcode is preferable over a good lobby... but you could have both
[3:21:27] <DaKnightWarrior> lytOUCH
[3:21:29] <%justmildlilac> AMAZING CHANGES TO THE LOBBY
[3:21:38] <+FoxLex_> Yo, what park?
[3:21:40] <PFlare> @Menitta Arc Sys is obsessed with being 'stylish' and 'unique' with their lobbies, to their blind detriment.
[3:21:43] <%drefizz> @overkrustice jaboodyGranny
[3:21:44] <bigshedman> haha i turn 9 years olders next week haha fuck im old
[3:21:45] <Jediforce317> Lobby itself is behind. Stream is not matching actual lobby changes
[3:21:49] <+buredo> hey guys we fixed the lobby! :)
[3:21:49] <+Hitorio> @Pyrrhus90 Someone who is 18 years old right now was born in 2003.
[3:21:51] <fmbboaventura> The game looks soo good and the netplay works so well that something had to balance all this goodness Kappa
[3:21:54] <overkrustice> and the gap will only increase over time since these guys won't age
[3:21:56] <CupsCommander> I'm stuck readying up! How does that happen?!
[3:21:56] <Saltmeisterr> yeah Gio's va is the same age as me
[3:22:00] <Saltmeisterr> wild stuff
[3:22:03] <FullMetalSnorlax> I have to be somewhere in around 25 min, what should I do D:>

[3:22:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Member when you'd load up Gears of War 2 and hit play online
[3:22:40] <+Hitorio> I started reading Naruto when the 12 year olds in it were older than me.
[3:22:43] <deviljhojho_> removing the lobby as it is would straight up be an improvement

[3:23:18] <+Hitorio> Lol - literally just a white screen with Times New Roman names on it to pick from being seen as an upgrade over this lobby
[3:23:19] <FullMetalSnorlax> @WakeUpThrow when they get the kinks out it will be pretty alright for normal use. big line-ups like this will still be a pain though
[3:23:26] <+Shishi1205> What is the name of that flying ball? Benis?

[3:25:39] <bigshedman> Damn Woolie, you know a lot. You should make some videos about this shit Kappa
[3:25:39] <WakeUpThrow> @FullMetalSnorlax That's my main issue, lines will always be a problem in 2D lobbies like this one. Really wished they would keep them 3D like before, but what can you do
[3:25:40] <andre11dr> Oh course Woolie has an actual answer

[3:35:10] <CheyMix> woolie got alot better from the last beta
[3:35:12] <%justmildlilac> This version feels like one step forward, two steps back in a lot of aspects with the online
[3:35:26] <Pookiedaexzile> IshiWari wants the menus to be this way, only way this lobby made it thru meetings
[3:35:35] <+Shishi1205> I dont even try to lobby anymore I go into training mode and even then sometimes it boots me out of training bc too many matches are going at the same time
[3:35:41] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile It's absolutely 200% MUTHERR, but you're not supposed to admit that to people because you need to be cool.
[3:35:43] <+UberWolfman> Its almost as if multiple with various skills in their job made this game Kappa

[3:38:16] <andre11dr> Thank god that antiairs actually work now, it was so dumb when people jump in hit me out of grand viper
[3:38:20] <mrlooneyman> That was tight
[3:38:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[3:38:30] <+Amaz1nGrac3> I get it's Gulty Gear, but game is too loud to hear you guys in match
[3:38:32] <+Parrish_broadnax> it all comes down to this
[3:38:33] <+anoldtoilet> is blood mode different from A.B.A. who is 1,000 percent not in the game because nago is
[3:38:38] <LoneFonte> @Josef_Stryker it's absolutely risky
[3:38:39] <Applecannon63> @josef_stryker thats the point its why you manage it
[3:38:56] <%Josef_Stryker> I mean is the damage worth it?
[3:39:02] <DSD24> That's another good line
[3:39:05] <ace_sabo_luffy__> Hi guys hi chat KPOPvictory
[3:39:06] <Applecannon63> This is a high risk high reward character
[3:39:10] <DSD24> Though I still prefer stay away
[3:39:11] <+GelidSpace> @anoldtoilet completely different. ABA's always trying to get into activation, and Nago is always trying not to activate
[3:39:25] <+anoldtoilet> ohhh thats weird
[3:39:29] <Applecannon63> Dude Nago can chip with Blood rage
[3:39:32] <FightningX> blood mode is a punishment if you dont have the meter to end it immediately, and even then you can get punisehd for doing the super
[3:39:44] <+GelidSpace> it's partially a penalty mode for using his specials, but he does get some perks at the same time
[3:39:55] <ace_sabo_luffy__> SaiyoNARRAAAA!!!!
[3:40:00] <+anoldtoilet> that hp drain really is super fast
[3:40:12] <+Shishi1205> Blood rage is not worth if you are full life that blood rage cost the game
[3:40:16] <Pookiedaexzile> The Risk of Nago is nowhere near the reward yet
[3:40:19] <andre11dr> @gelidspace Well they both have activations that damage them but yeah they're not exactly the same
[3:40:39] <+Hitorio> Guilty Gear Strive @ EVO 2022 is about to be fire.
[3:40:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[3:40:40] <+GelidSpace> true that
[3:40:44] <%justmildlilac> Did they change the rage activation any? Is it shorter to start up now at least?
[3:40:47] <FightningX> At least Sin was able to manually refresh his gauge for chaining supers
[3:40:49] <andre11dr> I do think Nago was inspired by ABA
[3:40:53] <+Parrish_broadnax> his swan song
[3:40:59] <+Shishi1205> @justmildlilac nah
[3:41:02] <+yusefHD> having played about 300 matches as mr. vampire I'm pretty certain that they're going to bust the blood gauge
[3:41:03] <%justmildlilac> F
[3:41:11] <%Juriasu> YOO
[3:41:12] <breakalane> interesting how Nago is like anti-Hakumen.  Hakumen has to wait to go ham but Nago has to hold back
[3:41:18] <%Sparkseid> GGS
[3:41:21] <+yusefHD> Buf
[3:41:22] <%LastHazzerd> when did you start playing SamSho
[3:41:25] <Murdercles> yea red guy could not go in, blood was too high
[3:41:35] <ace_sabo_luffy__> @andre11dr i thought it was aba Kappa

[3:42:20] <garbageheaphound> go for sets my man just have fun
[3:42:24] <+Hitorio> Millia looking that good when she takes the hat off is similar to Noel's take-the-hat-off glow ups in early Blazblue

[3:43:16] <+Shishi1205> oceania 3
[3:43:24] <%Brightstreak> the delay is only 3 seconds
[3:43:30] <%Brightstreak> not a huge delay
[3:43:35] <MagumaDono> but you gotta accoutn for the game's delays
[3:43:37] <andre11dr> Also why is ABA named ABA? that's not even a rock reference
[3:43:40] <laschoelmachooo> game released already?
[3:43:43] <MagumaDono> the lobby has a lot of hang time with connecting and unconnecting
[3:43:52] <%LastHazzerd> yeeeah! blue wolf
[3:43:53] <LoneFonte> @laschoelmachooo last beta before release
[3:44:10] <skeletonkingofmanlets> GET IM
[3:44:12] <laschoelmachooo> @lonefonte I see, thanks
[3:44:12] <bigshedman> @andre11dr Blood types :)
[3:44:21] <PFlare> @andre11dr ABBA?
[3:44:21] <CupsCommander> @andre11dr It's not rock, it's a music writing thing
[3:44:33] <MagumaDono> Clean reggie, clean
[3:44:35] <user_naim> Doing rematches probably keeps the p2p connection too right? Whereas if you exit to the lobby you might DC?
[3:44:42] <CupsCommander> Not the band either lol
[3:44:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Abba is a band
[3:44:43] <MagumaDono> Yeah,
[3:44:48] <%LastHazzerd> 🌜
[3:44:51] <MagsPowerLive> reggies mic could stand to come up a notch in the mix
[3:44:52] <MagumaDono> having the rematch makes it much easier
[3:44:58] <PFlare> Oof.
[3:45:00] <TimetodiveLTX> jesus
[3:45:02] <+Shishi1205> Thank god for remathces
[3:45:05] <TimetodiveLTX> they fly so fast
[3:45:08] <@Menitta> who got the dip
[3:45:14] <andre11dr> I know it meant to be ABBA but that's like the one random disco reference when most things are rock or metal
[3:45:14] <skeletonkingofmanlets> DAMN
[3:45:15] <velgaduere> the SHINE
[3:45:17] <+PianoAlone> LUL
[3:45:18] <MagumaDono> Reggie, doin' the Juicebox
[3:45:22] <Ardisan_> I love how dynamic faces are in this game
[3:45:27] <DSD24> Choco Millia
[3:45:28] <%LastHazzerd> oh you feelin' yaself?
[3:45:29] <+Shishi1205> I only found one dude who backed out after the first game
[3:45:35] <@Menitta> Oh shit it's Azure
[3:45:44] <user_naim> @magumadono yeah I got a five match set just fine and immediatly disconnected once i returned to the lobby
[3:45:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Alright lets think thematically, why would Abba be named something different fro mthe  rest of the cast
[3:45:46] <MagsPowerLive> if im alone on that opinion that's fine i'll never say it again
[3:45:52] <%LastHazzerd> nice name, nice color choice
[3:45:52] <ace_sabo_luffy__> Millia pretty hot
[3:45:52] <+Hitorio> The first thing that ever had me thinking Guilty Gear was cool was seeing a girl user her giant key as a stepping platform to to an attack off of.
[3:45:59] <PFlare> Oof.
[3:46:00] <%Juriasu> LUL
[3:46:03] <+Shishi1205> Also the set ending because the opponet gets relocated in a tower floor sucks super bad
[3:46:03] <PFlare> This is just a player mismatch.
[3:46:24] <KINGRAY898> what park and region is woolie in
[3:46:32] <+Shishi1205> oceania 3
[3:46:34] <user_naim> @kingray898 oceania 3 i think
[3:46:38] <%LastHazzerd> does her grade actually reflect the gameplay?
[3:46:52] <FightningX> @Shishi1205 It's like your opponent styled on you so hard the game decided to have them ASCEND
[3:46:54] <+Hitorio> Giovanna became a blue fish mutant.
[3:47:04] <+Shishi1205> yeah or descend lmao
[3:47:08] <KINGRAY898> @user_naim thanks
[3:47:15] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile If I was a Lore Master or that familiar with ABBA, I would walk this road.
[3:47:19] <Saltmeisterr> hey whats the difference between gold burst and normal one?
[3:47:32] <+Shishi1205> Lucario's aura is based on dmg tho not meter
[3:47:37] <TheAzureOracle> @WoolieVersus damn the one thing I didn't want to fight was Reggie's Millia, that's some scary stuff. GGs man good fun
[3:47:41] <+erro232> Regi got me thinking he’s playing Dbz with these aerials

[3:47:50] <%slayabee> @saltmeisterr Gold burst is an RC, regular burst is based on the burst meter
[3:47:52] <+yusefHD> Jump in vanna
[3:47:54] <andre11dr> Gold burst is when your not getting hit
[3:47:57] <MagumaDono> LETS GO FROTHY!
[3:47:59] <MagumaDono> POT BUSTAH
[3:48:10] <andre11dr> Gold burst gives you full meter

[3:57:56] <zenith0111> @raven_in_a_tree Shes too hard for noobs so most dont main her because of that
[3:57:58] <LoneFonte> English May sounds more bearable
[3:57:59] <PFlare> May's voice is weird for me. Not in that I don't like it or that I do. I think it fits her but at the same time doesn't.
[3:58:01] <%Juriasu> CHAAARGE

[3:58:50] <CupsCommander> I kinda wish May still screamed TOTSUGEKIIIII in English
[3:58:53] <+Hitorio> I had a similar pleasant surprise when Pyra's English voice was lower pitched than her JP version
[3:58:55] <andre11dr> At least she's not as annoying in English
[3:58:59] <RAH001> i swear may doesnt look like a charge character
[3:59:01] <DSD24> I thought May's like 25
[3:59:03] <MayShip> in my experience when Nago goes wild he blows me out of the water. like he swings that sword like a bat and i die
[3:59:05] <+LionKagura> @ChillDima please no

[4:00:11] <+LionKagura> Dracula don't bite
[4:00:11] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I was watching lore and saw that may is strong because shes Japanese GG lore is strange
[4:00:14] <PFlare> @Pookiedaexzile We have an idea of it nowadays.
[4:00:14] <Applecannon63> Bite
[4:00:24] <Pookiedaexzile> yeah like 42

[4:00:37] <DedlokPM> octoPathetic
[4:00:39] <PFlare> @Pookiedaexzile As was said above you, she's in her early 40s. Japanese are Special in the GG verse, though.
[4:00:42] <breakalane> @slayabee truth
[4:00:47] <velgaduere> do smol combo
[4:00:47] <+MTLxSpider> just close your ears
[4:00:51] <+MTLxSpider> its easy
[4:00:53] <PFlare> So she looks this young because they're more or less elves.

[4:00:57] <andre11dr> @raven_in_a_tree Well this game is made by a bunch of Japanese people LUL
[4:01:06] <user_naim> oceania 3 @cloudman_exe
[4:01:09] <user_naim> park

[4:01:14] <Ardisan_> Japanses people are elves in Guilty Gear lore confirmed
[4:01:18] <Pookiedaexzile> @PFlare I know...I just like saying 42
[4:01:27] <+Shishi1205> wow
[4:01:29] <+MTLxSpider> lol
[4:01:29] <zenith0111> Did you giys check the news feed? In this region alone 1 million matches have been played
[4:01:29] <PFlare> To be fair, they balanced it out by saying that there's like...3-4 Japanese people alive as of now.
[4:01:30] <Pookiedaexzile> techincally right, but feels like a good number
[4:01:31] <Ardisan_> That impact

[4:05:09] <breakalane> @psych0j0sh I'd say decent
[4:05:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Give Nago Health back when he grabs in Blood Rage
[4:05:14] <velgaduere> @Raven_In_A_Tree as good as they ever are
[4:05:20] <breakalane> zato was also dead
[4:05:21] <Bunyanator> I'm having problems sorry. One moment.
[4:05:22] <+Hitorio> What's ArcSys Team Blue been up to?
[4:05:41] <TheAzureOracle> @MagumaDono GGs friend
[4:05:42] <andre11dr> @raven_in_a_tree Maybe, but she would be Aria instead
[4:05:43] <+Hitorio> Just Cross Tag? :o
[4:05:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Literally yes
[4:05:53] <Saltmeisterr> DnF?
[4:05:54] <velgaduere> they say they're having problems
[4:05:56] <TrashLeviathan> which team is working on dnf
[4:06:01] <Applecannon63> Team Blue is working with that app game
[4:06:09] <SpookyBeef7> So, on my end both of them are still on the farther station....
[4:06:13] <Applecannon63> Team Red is working on DnF
[4:06:15] <+FoxLex_> Uhhh you're not there
[4:06:20] <andre11dr> If anything i can see Aria having an Install where she becomes Justice
[4:06:36] <breakalane> unfortunately the lobby is still horribly de-synced
[4:06:38] <TimetodiveLTX> lobbies need a smack upside the head emote
[4:06:44] <%justmildlilac> AMAZING ARCSYS LOBBIES
[4:06:45] <%Klefth> Imagine having lobbies
[4:06:46] <+FoxLex_> Like that connection drop desynced you
[4:06:47] <TheAzureOracle> I was timing the delay by swinging the bat and checking when it happened on stream. It's about 5-6 seconds
[4:06:49] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Wouldnt Aria be Jack O though
[4:06:52] <TimetodiveLTX> just a good smash to the top of the head
[4:06:55] <$SilverRoddo> Wakarimashita desu ka?
[4:06:55] <DasFreekman> DESKCHAN THE SERVERS
[4:06:56] <Picia000123> Woolie is a really patient man
[4:06:58] <velgaduere> yeah maybe the connection drop fucked things
[4:07:09] <breakalane> Justice/Jack-O hybrid in Strive. the worst timeline
[4:07:28] <zenith0111> what if its just some rando?
[4:07:30] <Applecannon63> why not?
[4:07:34] <+Hitorio> Jack-O face-down-ass-up tactical stance. Among the greatest crouches in fighting games.
[4:07:53] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus yeah maybe the connection drop fucked things
[4:07:54] <Bunyanator> Hey its adamsaints, I'm sorry I'm not sure what's going on. I'll drop out.
[4:08:01] <bootysteve> is he intentionally on oceania servers?
[4:08:07] <andre11dr> I actually really like Jack-O ,i know people hate her because she's a nightmare as player ,but she's really cool
[4:08:15] <+anoldtoilet> shes a great concept
[4:08:16] <SpookyBeef7> Yeah, server connection seems really wonky.
[4:08:17] <@Menitta> Yeah oceania is emptier
[4:08:24] <+Zer0Shard> Why Oceania lobby
[4:08:26] <%barkon345> god these lobbies are such garbage
[4:08:28] <@Menitta> oh NOOOOO
[4:08:30] <lonosis47> Thats not how you pronounce Oceania lmfao
[4:08:30] <Dr_Mooose> uhhh

[4:08:43] <Nekros4442> REGGIE WHY Kappa
[4:08:43] <+Hitorio> To the lore masters out there - are the Gears actually guilty?
[4:08:43] <echobee_tv> That is R Code Blazing
[4:08:43] <Raven_In_A_Tree> F
[4:08:44] <NotHereToStream> sums up the beta pretty much

[4:10:14] <Rawbone_saw> let's goooo
[4:10:25] <+Hitorio> @anoldtoilet Racism? Well that just leaves me with more questions. Oh, man. It'd be convenient if there'd, hypothetically speaking, be a video series on WoolieVersus I could check out
[4:10:33] <+Hitorio> About Guilty Gear lore.
[4:10:39] <Raven_In_A_Tree> What obscure GG characters would Yall like to see

[4:11:50] <velgaduere> Woolie like AngelThump
[4:11:53] <Saltmeisterr> Damn woolie staring at the sun
[4:12:03] <+MugenSandan> Playing Guilty Gear is making Woolie ASCEND
[4:12:10] <velgaduere> Woolie intentionally handicapping his vision so he doesn't shit all over chat
[4:12:14] <+anoldtoilet> holy shit
[4:12:18] <NotHereToStream> hope the glare isn't screwing him too bad
[4:12:19] <+anoldtoilet> beast beast beast
[4:12:20] <RAH001> the sun on woolie face
[4:12:21] <Pookiedaexzile> @Saltmeisterr That is way more in character than you think
[4:12:31] <+Cyoctane> Woolie is ascending
[4:12:39] <+CherteuseKapibara> this axl just wants to play man
[4:12:42] <+Shishi1205> almost a perfect
[4:12:43] <+anoldtoilet> thats not the sun thats woolies ki aura
[4:12:44] <DutchDejimaDealer> gotta block man
[4:12:49] <andre11dr> Also mot an obscure caracter at all, but would really like to see Asuka playable
[4:12:51] <+Parrish_broadnax> lol without looking at the screen, Octo's Axl could also pass for a Roger's Sonic
[4:12:57] <zenith0111> This Axl needs to learn 5p and 2h and Snail
[4:13:04] <Saltmeisterr> oh i forgot woolie got powers back in december
[4:13:08] <Rawbone_saw> ooooooh
[4:13:12] <Rawbone_saw> that voiceline is the best
[4:13:13] <RAH001> woolie how can u see with that light in ur eyes xD
[4:13:16] <Bunyanator> Hey woolie, Thanks for the fight. That really made my night.
[4:13:17] <+Hitorio> Okay. Realistically and practically, how hype would a Guilty Gear x Blazblue game be?
[4:13:27] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus How much longer you going for?
[4:13:30] <%justmildlilac> I honestly wouldn't like it.
[4:13:32] <FullMetalSnorlax> Pro ZD? not even close
[4:13:33] <Saltmeisterr> faust time
[4:13:38] <+MugenSandan> if it's anything like Cross Tag... not very
[4:13:45] <+yeknomlive> isnt Faust kaiji tang
[4:13:48] <+Hitorio> damn lol
[4:13:53] <Saltmeisterr> @yeknomlive ye
[4:13:58] <FullMetalSnorlax> Gabriel has a btter voice than Potempkin
[4:13:59] <+yeknomlive> sick
[4:14:01] <%justmildlilac> There's too much overlap in the casts gameplay wise to be interesting, imo @hitorio
[4:14:04] <Afrosamasenpai> "CCCCRACK"
[4:14:08] <FlowLethal> Gulity gear models be higher quality   blazblue ones are used for mass character production
[4:14:10] <+Hitorio> +R sprites re-used
[4:14:12] <FlowLethal> crossover might not work
[4:14:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait....Isnt Ichiban also tall......
[4:14:22] <andre11dr> @hitorio I don't really see the point when a lot of BB caracter are just more generic looking version of GG caracters
[4:14:30] <%justmildlilac> ^
[4:14:33] <%drefizz> @Hitorio d^
[4:14:37] <+yeknomlive> ichiban and nanba fused
[4:14:37] <+Hitorio> i c i c
[4:14:46] <Pookiedaexzile> HE DONT MISS
[4:14:51] <%drefizz> didn't mean to @
[4:14:53] <+Shishi1205> molted out
[4:15:04] <FullMetalSnorlax> Did Nago just Rip Faust out of his clothes?
[4:15:20] <%drefizz> VORED
[4:15:28] <Rawbone_saw> woolieLORE c l e a n
[4:15:34] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I would prefer not an BB crossover mostly because id rather a weirder crossover
[4:15:39] <bootysteve> VORE
[4:15:45] <+anoldtoilet> do a dragonball crossover.
[4:15:50] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> LUL
[4:15:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie
[4:15:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:15:57] <FullMetalSnorlax> What does Faust say after doing the throw?
[4:15:57] <velgaduere> trying to eat a vampire seems like a bad idea
[4:15:59] <Rawbone_saw> HAH
[4:16:00] <+Shishi1205> Oh wow the gear from the stage is doing sound lmao
[4:16:09] <+Shishi1205> Thats midly annoying
[4:16:09] <+Hitorio> @Raven_In_A_Tree A weirder crossover. Tekken x Melty Blood
[4:16:12] <%drefizz> Sol vs Kenpachi Zaraki
[4:16:15] <%barkon345> @anoldtoilet now that wood be hype
[4:16:15] <Pookiedaexzile> I see they paid Woolie in Access to the beta early
[4:16:22] <$emptyantics> Nago is so sick
[4:16:29] <bootysteve> You wanna bring in a real weirdo? Bring in Dr. Paradox or whatever his name is
[4:16:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Shishi1205 it's the GEAR THAT WAS GUILTY ALL ALONG
[4:16:39] <Applecannon63> I would honestly think the only fitting character from blazblue to make into guilty gear would be Hakumen or Susanoo
[4:16:48] <+Hitorio> ^interesting
[4:16:49] <+Shishi1205> guilt of annoyance
[4:16:50] <Pookiedaexzile> "Money , yeyeye, whatever, let me get the build"
[4:16:56] <Raven_In_A_Tree> @Hitorio i dont know What melty blood is so sure
[4:17:05] <+LionKagura> What is English Nago saying at the start of his win quote? it just sounds like word salad then i hear defeat
[4:17:12] <$emptyantics> I don’t like any designs from Blazblue
[4:17:12] <Deko_> PogChamp
[4:17:16] <SpookyBeef7> OOF
[4:17:20] <SpookyBeef7> GG Woolie!
[4:17:22] <+Shishi1205> Got those on lock
[4:17:32] <+Hitorio> @emptyantics Daamn. None of them? :O
[4:17:44] <FlowLethal> i cant think of any blazblue designs i like besides hakuman
[4:17:50] <NotHereToStream> bishi boi
[4:17:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Blazblue is "fine, we'll go to McDonalds" after cooking a gourmet meal.
[4:17:58] <Applecannon63> or if we want to get boring one of the Murakumo Units from Blazblue
[4:18:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yellow ky lookin nice
[4:18:06] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Ah okay, was wondering if I should try my chances cause I see that FUCKING LINE
[4:18:16] <user_naim> Real Strive hours
[4:18:17] <+aishman> Everyone wanna get in there
[4:18:20] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I like The guy in the suit in BB. And bullet
[4:18:44] <zenith0111> We love you Woolz even if I dont get a match I love your content and hope to enjoy for mlre uears to come :)
[4:18:47] <%justmildlilac> Kagura is probably my favorite BB character ngl
[4:18:49] <+Hitorio> There are a lot of designs I enjoy to some degree in Blazblue.
[4:18:50] <Pookiedaexzile> All of them by detention are restricted
[4:18:51] <sora2025> her super they combo together
[4:18:53] <stonestring93> Zato is already in the game for that tho
[4:19:01] <Pookiedaexzile> definition*
[4:19:05] <NotHereToStream> Doggo should be an assist
[4:19:08] <zenith0111> oh god my thumbs cant spell
[4:19:10] <Applecannon63> Gio should've had Dog as an assist character
[4:19:18] <+Shishi1205> He gorillas by spinning
[4:19:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[4:19:23] <+FuqBoiSlim> P'D ON?!
[4:19:24] <Applecannon63> not a puppet characte
[4:19:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Like Ryu could do way more shit with the hadoken but in the game he shoots it forward
[4:19:37] <andre11dr> Wow i just realized ,Nago is basically just a better Akuman ,i don't know how missed that up until now
[4:19:37] <macathelo> ramleties?
[4:19:38] <%drefizz> Ram and her thigh jiggle physics
[4:19:40] <Monkeyweed21> they removed some gorilla blood from Leo and injected it into Anji
[4:19:41] <SunnySideX> dayum
[4:19:43] <macathelo> hahhahaha
[4:19:48] <FlowLethal> Ky was like sol imma need that dragon install of yours
[4:19:48] <zenith0111> RAM THINGS WutFace
[4:19:50] <%justmildlilac> Well put, yeah. Anji's the missing link LUL
[4:19:55] <+Shishi1205> 🅱️ enis
[4:20:03] <Applecannon63> Leo is still gorilla
[4:20:12] <scrublord009> When you land Leo command grab Kreygasm
[4:20:27] <$emptyantics> Who’s Ky’s English VA?
[4:20:37] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Why do we hate Ky? Hes kinda cool
[4:20:40] <Applecannon63> Leo with the gorilla throw and fast fire ball
[4:20:45] <Saltmeisterr> Sean Chiplock
[4:20:46] <+Hitorio> Oh shit. It's Monkeyweed.
[4:20:56] <%Josef_Stryker> @emptyantics Sean Chiplock
[4:20:57] <NotHereToStream> A potemkin yrc me'd and buster'd me, it sucked
[4:21:11] <%justmildlilac> I gotta say this game is the first in a while where I could legitimately see myself wanting to play like half of the cast, they're all that cool and interesting
[4:21:11] <Saltmeisterr> oh shit Octo is strimmin strive
[4:21:12] <Asuterisuku> Dead Angle is such an awful name though.
[4:21:15] <%Josef_Stryker> He did Revali, Mista, Mishima and Noob Saibot
[4:21:25] <MayShip> i'm still having trouble RC drifting.
[4:21:25] <Applecannon63> What about bring back Force Breaks/Ex Moves
[4:21:28] <Afrosamasenpai> Oh word? Gonna steal that.
[4:21:36] <andre11dr> Oh Ram ,you are so much more likable and cooler than your wierd sister Elephant
[4:21:49] <andre11dr> I fucking hate Elephant
[4:22:01] <user_naim> @andre11dr yeah?
[4:22:03] <+Shishi1205> 🅱️ enis
[4:22:04] <velgaduere> 🅱️ enis
[4:22:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Grapplers in chat , just all started bursting
[4:22:06] <Saltmeisterr> i hate Elephant too :)
[4:22:06] <Raven_In_A_Tree> But elephant has GUN
[4:22:18] <+Hitorio> I hear some people dislike Elephant and Jack-O because they look more anime waifu than old Guilty Gear.
[4:22:21] <%justmildlilac> Best thing Elephant has going for her is booba
[4:22:22] <andre11dr> That's the one GG caracter that feels just cliche
[4:22:25] <%drefizz> Sol and his polygamy of just his wife
[4:22:30] <Monkeyweed21> @andre11dr are you not a fan of constantly blocking grenade mixups and not being able to press a button
[4:22:34] <TrashLeviathan> i like elephants moveset i just dont like her whole waifu thing
[4:22:50] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> But she's Guns & Roses though...
[4:22:51] <andre11dr> Yeah her gameplay is hell as well
[4:22:51] <velgaduere> @drefizz just his... kinda sounds like... ⚖️
[4:23:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Anyone who thinks JAck-O is too anime never played any GG's before the 3 d change

[4:25:20] <Deko_> LUL
[4:25:20] <%Josef_Stryker> I wonder if Woolie would ever be willing to give Blazblue an honest GIFG chance
[4:25:20] <andre11dr> @hitorio I disagree, i like Sol WAY more than Ragna

[4:25:50] <+Hitorio> @andre11dr What details make the difference for you guys? @Pookiedaexzile @andre11dr
[4:25:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Ragna is room temp anime trash

[4:26:29] <FullMetalSnorlax> that one guy has been walkin round for a while, not part of the stream
[4:26:30] <+Hitorio> I like Ragna's color palette and weapon more - as well as his jacket.
[4:26:30] <%Lion_kun> Like he might have just accidentally mvoed up.
[4:26:33] <aaropoll> do you think this is a good enough game to raise it out of rais it's niche genre or is it still just a Guilty Gear game
[4:26:36] <FacetiousAF> zat 01
[4:26:36] <jegginz02> He tried
[4:26:40] <+aojr1010> finally zato
[4:26:41] <+Shishi1205> 90K zato
[4:26:45] <+yeknomlive> itd be cool if there was a line mechanic built in
[4:26:45] <+VariantX7> @Lion_kun 100% truth
[4:26:48] <@Menitta> oh fuck
[4:26:51] <Saltmeisterr> Time for mister mercer
[4:26:55] <user_naim> Finally Zato
[4:27:01] <+Shishi1205> Oh its not cum zato
[4:27:03] <$emptyantics> Zato the monster
[4:27:05] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio You like DMC 2 perhaps? big SAO fan
[4:27:06] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Ky is way better than Jin but i like both Sol and Ragna
[4:27:06] <@Menitta> there should be a queue system
[4:27:09] <velgaduere> HE WAS NOT READY
[4:27:15] <FacetiousAF> rrrrrrip
[4:27:15] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[4:27:15] <@Moobot> @Solidus_113 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 34 minutes
[4:27:19] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[4:27:30] <+Hitorio> I also like how the Murakumo units look. The floating blade symphony of theirs - dope fighting style. Nice android look as well.
[4:27:36] <user_naim> o h   n o
[4:27:40] <BlackermanZX> a zato player monkaS
[4:27:40] <CupsCommander> I've only fought one Zato this beta, but it was definitely a good Zato.
[4:27:41] <andre11dr> Zato, aka make a Jojo fighter already Arcsis
[4:27:43] <+Shishi1205> wow that sounds not like jp zato at all
[4:27:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man mercer's voice is so recogniseable
[4:27:58] <NotHereToStream> sick pose 10/10
[4:27:59] <WakeUpThrow> Ohhh Zato sounds NICE
[4:28:03] <FacetiousAF> this zato is VERY comfy right now
[4:28:04] <%justmildlilac> I think it's very neat that the character with a Dio color is voiced by Jotaro's english VA
[4:28:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Blazblue looks like what weebs draw when they first start to understand design
[4:28:07] <+FoxLex_> Yellow Burst os not comboable
[4:28:09] <Ardisan_> Zato sounds cleeen
[4:28:10] <%Josef_Stryker> That's Matt Mercer for ya
[4:28:12] <%drefizz> IT IS?
[4:28:14] <TrashLeviathan> i love that zato just straight up jojo poses as his win pose
[4:28:22] <%drefizz> I thought it was my dad
[4:28:24] <%Dr00_PhD> That's some matt mercer ass matt mercer
[4:28:29] <BlackermanZX> of course is matt mercer
[4:28:30] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile Is that a real question, or a quip that means "do you like other shitty things?" :P Either way, I'm picking up what you're putting down.
[4:28:33] <WakeUpThrow> Oh it's Mercer? No wonder his dub is great lmao
[4:28:33] <+FoxLex_> Yellow RC I mean
[4:28:38] <%thedankestmeeme> wait the actor?
[4:28:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @drefizz matt is everyone's dad
[4:28:40] <$emptyantics> Nice
[4:28:42] <Palmtuna> This is my first time seeing Zato. I-is he a stand user??
[4:28:42] <ElPlasa> On one hand: Matt Mercer. On the other hand: Takehito Koyasu. On my hands: Broken fingers
[4:28:44] <@Menitta> god I thought you meant you were playing against Matt Mercer lmao
[4:28:47] <Ardisan_> Zato is so cool
[4:28:47] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Matt Mercer has good range actually
[4:28:52] <%Dr00_PhD> He was zato in Sign
[4:28:58] <%thedankestmeeme> @Menitta wait SO HE'S NOT?!?!
[4:29:01] <%Dr00_PhD> glad they brought him back
[4:29:02] <+Shishi1205> nice
[4:29:03] <Ardisan_> I wish I could Zato but my brain failed science
[4:29:05] <%Josef_Stryker> Matt Mercer does a damn good Majima
[4:29:05] <bigshedman> @Raven_In_A_Tree Yeah dude his 6P is sick
[4:29:05] <+TopTieramisu> let's go

[4:29:12] <+Hayajin_> alcoholism vs getting into fighting games
[4:29:12] <$emptyantics> I hope Judgement comes back 👏
[4:29:20] <%drefizz> @Menitta technically he is
[4:29:31] <%LastHazzerd> and who is KYs VA
[4:29:32] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio It was more, What other generic anime thing can I think of, but I shoulda went way more 2005, That's on me.
[4:29:33] <%justmildlilac> I...don't think I have enough IQ to properly Zato, ngl
[4:29:35] <%drefizz> acaiBlabba
[4:29:36] <andre11dr> BB does have some designs o dig ,Nail ,Hakuman, Arakune,Susano,Tager,and some of the robots are ok
[4:29:41] <%Josef_Stryker> Ky's voiced by Sean Chiplock
[4:29:45] <+Hitorio> Hmm. I think I can understand where one is coming from when they say Blazblue is generic anime, but I don't find much about it repulsive.
[4:29:50] <%LastHazzerd> ah, so Sean v Matt
[4:29:52] <KeiPrime> taokaka is cool
[4:29:59] <+Shishi1205> Zato definitely needs a big brain to pilot
[4:29:59] <Raven_In_A_Tree> @Hayajin_ why not both
[4:30:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:30:05] <Ardisan_> Whose the easiest puppet character in fighting games. They usually require brains
[4:30:06] <+TopTieramisu> oof
[4:30:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Nail, is just more generic CHipp
[4:30:09] <%Sparkseid> the bait
[4:30:09] <andre11dr> But i find every female character in BB to be lame as fuck
[4:30:11] <+Hitorio> Now that I think about it, DMC2's Dante outfit are a lot of people's favorites.
[4:30:14] <Pookiedaexzile> This is what I mean

[4:30:37] <zenith0111> Kreygasm Take me
[4:30:40] <Saltmeisterr> NOT THE GOVERNMENT NotLikeThis
[4:30:44] <WakeUpThrow> You get your ass whooped and then get employed, that's sick
[4:30:46] <Ardisan_> @BillHicks5051 I like your use of the word "CLAIM" there
[4:31:01] <+Hitorio> For those that dislike BB designs, what do you guys think of Under Night and Melty Blood designs?
[4:31:09] <%Josef_Stryker> That's like Armstrong chopping Sam's arm off and then hiring him into Desperado
[4:31:19] <+yeknomlive> I like under nights more
[4:31:20] <Ardisan_> I like Under Night, not so much Melty designs except for like 2
[4:31:21] <+Shishi1205> "say hello" Ky says hello
[4:31:28] <TrashLeviathan> i think mb designs are too simple
[4:31:32] <Ardisan_> Under Nights meh designs for me is Carmine and claw grappler guy
[4:31:33] <SirCacaPee> WOOLAYY
[4:31:37] <NotHereToStream> don't talk shit about Eltnum
[4:31:37] <%drefizz> @Hitorio one of those sounds like a game that belongs in a bathroom
[4:31:41] <DSD24> Yuzu's design in Melty Bllod is great
[4:31:45] <$emptyantics> Undernight’s designs are ok at best but Meltyblood’s are not great
[4:31:46] <DSD24> I mean Under Night
[4:31:51] <TrashLeviathan> undernight has some cool designs
[4:31:58] <Raven_In_A_Tree> @Hitorio i know neither of those series
[4:32:01] <+BillHicks5051> What about Million Arthur?
[4:32:02] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio  Generic, they don't take enough risks, and they were made a decade ago
[4:32:08] <andre11dr> @hitorio I like those games inspite if there designs
[4:32:18] <andre11dr> Of*
[4:32:26] <andre11dr> At least UNIEL
[4:32:28] <+Hitorio> Ah. Makes sense. Makes sense.
[4:32:35] <WakeUpThrow> I'm not the biggest on UNI's designs, but when they're good, they're REALLY good (Yuzu, Merkava, Carmine, for example)
[4:32:36] <Ardisan_> Under Night does simple to its benefit while Melty does simply to a detriment
[4:32:46] <+Hitorio> Pookie, I take it you find Uner Night and Melty "generic" while you find BB outright "repulsive"
[4:32:50] <TimetodiveLTX> cie's design is good, hime's design is good, arcueid's design is good, kouma's design is good, nero's design is good
[4:32:51] <TimetodiveLTX> etc etc
[4:32:59] <TimetodiveLTX> shut the front door
[4:33:02] <Dragon_Batman> Oh my god, I know what you mean LUL
[4:33:05] <zenith0111> HAHA
[4:33:05] <andre11dr> Im not the biggest Melty fan ,i do respect the broken shit that game has tho
[4:33:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> woolie got ptsd LUL
[4:33:06] <%Sparkseid> saaaame
[4:33:08] <DSD24> Shiki has glasses
[4:33:28] <ElPlasa> The Pilebunker chick in melty is cool tho
[4:33:29] <+BillHicks5051> Doesn't BB have like a 98987 generic sword characters?
[4:33:34] <+Hitorio> I guess it doesn't help Melty Blood that it's based off of a visual novel about a bunch of people in school uniforms and shit
[4:34:02] <andre11dr> I will defend BB and say that the gameplay is really good
[4:34:02] <$emptyantics> Shiki is the most boring design
[4:34:06] <TimetodiveLTX> ciel's* design and powered ciel's design is goo
[4:34:06] <+Hitorio> @TimetodiveLTX Interesting
[4:34:08] <TimetodiveLTX> d
[4:34:10] <DSD24> We blocking
[4:34:17] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I like Taokaka actually
[4:34:19] <%LastHazzerd> Dolphin slash
[4:34:34] <Applecannon63> Honestly the designs of Melty Blood cheap Doujinshi designs
[4:34:41] <+Shishi1205> he says Drill but it sounds like drip
[4:34:45] <$emptyantics> @applecannon63 Yep
[4:34:48] <%LastHazzerd> it's impressive that Ky's jacket stays on him
[4:34:49] <%drefizz> Which Shiki
[4:34:52] <andre11dr> If BB had good online i would've try to actually get good at it because i find the gameplay interesting
[4:34:52] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio Those other two are normcore school uniform shit, Blazblue smells like Arcsys wanted to make something people would buy more
[4:35:06] <+Hitorio> I like Nine the Phantom's overall look, though I haven't taken a look at her closer trinkets.
[4:35:07] <Applecannon63> same goes for Fate since they are made by the same company
[4:35:09] <+Breedofevil> im trying to get into GG rev, should i use my pad or stick? im coming off of fighterz haha
[4:35:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Like "What if we toned down GG"
[4:35:18] <$emptyantics> Can’t wait for the DFO fighting game
[4:35:24] <CrimsonContrast> I liked Relius's design
[4:35:24] <%drefizz> the only character I care about in BB is Taokaka, that it
[4:35:25] <+yeknomlive> whatever you're comfortable with
[4:35:33] <DSD24> Shiki with the Red Jacket is cool in  Garden of Sinners
[4:35:34] <Ardisan_> DFO is sick so that fighting game will be POG
[4:35:43] <%Sparkseid> very nice
[4:35:44] <+TopTieramisu> let's go
[4:35:46] <$emptyantics> @ardisan_ Hell yeah brother 💪
[4:35:46] <BlackermanZX> good shit
[4:35:47] <+waltzqueen> @drefizz are there any characters other than taokaka?
[4:35:49] <Dragon_Batman> nice
[4:35:51] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> good shit reggie
[4:35:53] <+Hitorio> @DSD24 Ah, yes. Shiki Ryougi
[4:35:57] <Applecannon63> Taokaka and Jubei are the only interesting designs than Hakuman
[4:35:57] <%Wool> oh they're still going?
[4:35:59] <%illtima> I'm looking at Zato's animations and I legit cannot tell which attacks are mid and which are low
[4:36:04] <andre11dr> I respect BB i do find GG to be the better franchise
[4:36:07] <DSD24> @Hitorio I didn't want to mess up her name
[4:36:09] <%drefizz> Why are there two people named Shiki in Melty
[4:36:12] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I like that Taokaka isnt a normal catgirl like her fave and stuf
[4:36:18] <%LastHazzerd> good ol Ky
[4:36:21] <+Shishi1205> So pot and Zato have reflects?
[4:36:24] <Pookiedaexzile> I didn't even know Taokaka came from BB untill playing BB
[4:36:25] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Face*
[4:36:26] <DSD24> Taokaka has that cool shadow face
[4:36:30] <Saltmeisterr> I hope we get leo before the end of the stream
[4:36:36] <+Hitorio> @drefizz Same person. Different timelines. One completed his assassin training. One grew up to be a normal school dude.
[4:36:38] <Pookiedaexzile> She should survive
[4:36:40] <%Wool> is it no longer illegal for Reggie to be over there late
[4:36:43] <Dave_VD> @Shishi1205 I think leo might have one as well
[4:36:47] <Ardisan_> Taokaka is too tall for her design imo.
[4:36:58] <andre11dr> As opposed to Aracana Hart wich nobody respects LUL
[4:37:02] <CrimsonContrast> @andre, yeah it definitely is better
[4:37:06] <$emptyantics> @ardisan_ How tall is she?
[4:37:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[4:37:07] <+waltzqueen> i hope taokaka's real face is terrifying under that shadow
[4:37:08] <+Shishi1205> The shield yeah
[4:37:09] <%drefizz> @Hitorio wait Ryougi Shiki is a guy?
[4:37:10] <Applecannon63> Nanaya I heard is more interesting than what ever the fuck is Shiki's deal
[4:37:14] <FacetiousAF> ram lethal
[4:37:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Ardisan your fetish is slippin
[4:37:30] <%ChoculaUltra> he might be right monkaS
[4:37:33] <+Hitorio> @drefizz Ryougi Shiki is a chick. I thought you were referring to Shiki Tohno and Shiki Nanaya in Melty blood.
[4:37:34] <zenith0111> Democracy happened in the line because someone has to go soon
[4:37:36] <point4effort> Remlezar
[4:37:36] <DSD24> I believe Red Jacket Shiki is a lady that also has a guy personality in her
[4:37:37] <$emptyantics> I wanna RAM her LETHAL Kreygasm
[4:37:38] <%drefizz> @waltzqueen wasn't her face shown?
[4:37:39] <andre11dr> I thought it was supposed Raw Metal
[4:37:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NotLikeThis  japan
[4:37:45] <Ardisan_> @Pookiedaexzile No

[4:37:51] <+Shishi1205> 🅱️ enis
[4:37:52] <%LastHazzerd> she does a lot more lethal ramming to be honest
[4:37:52] <andre11dr> Well that's more lame than my version

[4:37:58] <Ardisan_> Kappa
[4:38:03] <$emptyantics> 🅱️ E N I S
[4:38:08] <+Hitorio> @drefizz Shiki Ryougi is from another universe. She has the same eye powers are the Tsukihime/Melty Blood Shiki, though. Maybe that's why they have the same name.
[4:38:26] <Sol_Install> I'm mad curious what the story trailer gonna share. cause I can see them showing off the possible season pass characters in it too
[4:38:27] <Dragon_Batman> Her name would be more like Sing Lethal if you went that route
[4:38:28] <Applecannon63> Oh god not the Nanuverse

[4:42:33] <+Hitorio> ArcSys Team Blue
[4:42:38] <+Hitorio> ftw
[4:42:43] <andre11dr> Nago ia like the anti Johnny, " Johnny is too strong," " BUFF JOHNNY" , "Nago is kinda difficult to use"  "NAKE IT HARDER"
[4:43:03] <+Hitorio> Persona 4 Arena is probably my first experience with a 2D fighting game in which I'm already hella invested in the characters
[4:43:03] <+RXSkyed> he sounds like the arbys the meats guy
[4:43:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @andre11dr one is white, wears black, one is black, wears white, makes sense
[4:43:36] <$emptyantics> @rxskyed LUL LUL LUL
[4:43:36] <+Hitorio> I guess P5 Strikers is what we're getting instead of a P5 Arena.
[4:43:43] <+Hitorio> Also a strong spin-off
[4:43:47] <Saltmeisterr> @Hitorio i mean those characters had a full rpg to flesh them out
[4:43:53] <+Hitorio> Exactly
[4:43:57] <+gg_aleph> we're still getting a P5 arena guys
[4:44:04] <Pookiedaexzile> More Fighting games need RPGs to flesh out the backstories
[4:44:07] <+Hitorio> It felt good to play a fighting game of that nature
[4:44:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:44:09] <+gg_aleph> they renewed the name copyright
[4:44:10] <andre11dr> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Didn't even realize that ,holy shit LUL
[4:44:16] <Pookiedaexzile> I'd play a game that was half Persona half GG
[4:44:20] <$emptyantics> @pookiedaexzile Amen
[4:44:24] <%AlteisenReiseZ> FORE
[4:44:25] <Saltmeisterr> u know story mode thats an rpg wouldn't be half bad
[4:44:25] <%justmildlilac> There's a "P5U" web domain registered by Atlus
[4:44:26] <+TopTieramisu> that camera was funky
[4:44:27] <FullMetalSnorlax> FRIG IW WAS TRYING TO FD
[4:44:30] <nothuzad> homerun
[4:44:31] <%Sparkseid> Sparkseid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! While Nagoriyuki is still fun to play, I cant make sense of the changes made to him either. Here's hoping the character changes are addressed in the next developer backyard.
[4:44:34] <zenith0111> Chip kill?
[4:44:36] <+Hitorio> I guess Granblue Fantasy Versus must feel great for those who are already into the Gacha game.
[4:44:37] <breakalane> @Pookiedaexzile ...blazblue is getting that phone game...
[4:44:51] <+TopTieramisu> granblue fantasy versus FeelsBadMan
[4:44:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Sorry did someone say something
[4:44:58] <+yusefHD> the people in line are not social distancing
[4:44:59] <+TopTieramisu> that game got really screwed over
[4:45:12] <andre11dr> @hitorio It looks pretty but wack online so i never bothered
[4:45:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Hitorio it'd feel better if the online worked, but y'know
[4:45:16] <+Hitorio> dat Granblue Timing
[4:45:17] <zenith0111> @pookiedaexzile It keeps getting tighter lmao
[4:45:20] <Saltmeisterr> damn no leo players
[4:45:20] <lunarbladeeclipse> I'm sad I've never been able to play Strive's betas
[4:45:26] <Dragon_Batman> Probably still catching up
[4:45:39] <Dragon_Batman> Oh nvm
[4:45:40] <Saltmeisterr> @DarkMoonFang13 this one is free to download
[4:45:48] <+Shishi1205> he tried to faultless defense @WoolieVersus he said
[4:46:18] <lunarbladeeclipse> which platform?
[4:46:18] <andre11dr> Man i might just spend tomorrow playing night but this
[4:46:22] <Pookiedaexzile> How hard would it be to replace turn based combat with a first to 3
[4:46:29] <zenith0111> ?
[4:46:37] <zenith0111> PogChamp
[4:46:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Full persona Convos, then right into a CPU versus
[4:46:48] <+Hitorio> Persona 4 Arena also gave us adult Persona 3 cast.
[4:46:51] <andre11dr> Or could go again threw RE 8 i did only beat it once
[4:47:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Damn, 5 HOURS of streaming, about 4 online, and not a single Leo tho
[4:47:31] <Saltmeisterr> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ i want my papa nier
[4:47:42] <%LastHazzerd> wait who is Faust's VA again?
[4:47:45] <Pookiedaexzile> I want Papa Neir
[4:47:46] <%Josef_Stryker> So no one has picked Leo the entire time?
[4:47:48] <Saltmeisterr> Kaiji Tang
[4:47:48] <+Shishi1205> Leo's are in danger of extinction
[4:47:48] <+FuqBoiSlim> Leobros in the mud? did he get nerfed?
[4:47:50] <+gg_aleph> I play Leo but the line was  too long and so I left
[4:47:53] <%Josef_Stryker> Faust's VA is Kaiji Tang
[4:47:53] <$emptyantics> Leo gang wya BibleThump
[4:47:59] <%Josef_Stryker> Ichiban's VA
[4:48:06] <user_naim> Yeah I’ve seen no Leos either, is he dead or something?
[4:48:08] <zenith0111> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Leos still good just people took that nerf announcement like they shot him
[4:48:09] <+Hitorio> Oh, Pookie - to add on to you learning about my aesthetic preferences and having ammunition towards me: I prefer Bro Nier over Dad Nier.
[4:48:12] <+Shishi1205> yakisoba pan gy
[4:48:27] <andre11dr> Who's Leo in the dub?
[4:48:28] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio Born to be enemies
[4:48:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> where's max when we need him
[4:48:33] <Saltmeisterr> @Hitorio u bout to get shot
[4:48:35] <zenith0111> when really all they did was make Leo more like Rev 2
[4:48:35] <Dragon_Batman> Leo is papa nier and Sojiro
[4:48:45] <+gg_aleph> Leo is still good, but he has no combos on the level of the rest of the roster
[4:48:55] <andre11dr> Ah i see that makes sense
[4:48:58] <%Josef_Stryker> @Hitorio In fairness, Grown Up Brother Nier looks good
[4:49:05] <+yeknomlive> leo still good. after crossover you dont combo you go for oki
[4:49:17] <Treyu000> LUL
[4:49:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[4:49:23] <zenith0111> @yeknomlive Like he did in Xrd
[4:49:28] <Dragon_Batman> Calculated lol
[4:49:30] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio IF only Guts never grew up
[4:49:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hide the shame
[4:49:35] <user_naim> Moon Knight over here
[4:49:36] <%MichaelDood> michae207Woohoo
[4:49:42] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile If I see you in these online lobbies, it's going down and you won't even remember who I am.
[4:49:43] <andre11dr> I got bodied hard bye a Leo ,his definitely still good
[4:49:54] <zenith0111> Unga is still bunga
[4:50:05] <+Hitorio> @Josef_Stryker Yeah; that timeskip was hella satisfying as Bro Nier
[4:50:06] <andre11dr> Definitely still has the unga in his hart
[4:50:10] <+gg_aleph> @zenith0111 he isn't like XRd  at all, more of an all rounder less of a rushdown
[4:50:19] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio If you ever see a Big ass Pot, rocking the loudest color
[4:50:22] <Pookiedaexzile> You'll know
[4:50:24] <+Hitorio> @Josef_Stryker and then you roll up on Kaine like "ey bby grl"
[4:50:27] <Dragon_Batman> Yea in the first beta that was something that was hard to not do
[4:50:30] <NotHereToStream> I think sol in this game is more unga than leo
[4:50:35] <$emptyantics> Where’s POT mains? Haven’t seen any yet
[4:50:48] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile You're a Pot? Maybe I don't want the smoke after all.
[4:50:51] <andre11dr> There where some
[4:50:52] <%Sparkseid> P O T
[4:50:52] <zenith0111> Sol vs Leo is in Leos favor I believe
[4:50:56] <+gg_aleph> the most unga in this game would be may
[4:50:57] <MagumaDono> MORE POTS
[4:50:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Kaine only works as the stepmom Our daughter Deserves
[4:50:59] <$emptyantics> OH SHIT
[4:51:01] <FullMetalSnorlax> I havn't landed a single bite, everyitme I dash in to bite I get a jab instead -_-
[4:51:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @NotHereToStream but none are as unga as may
[4:51:07] <Frothy_Milkshakes> ayy pot main
[4:51:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:51:12] <%Josef_Stryker> Forget the Pot mains, where the fuck is Leo?
[4:51:12] <andre11dr> SPEAKING OF THE DEVIL
[4:51:13] <Saltmeisterr> CRAZY TALK
[4:51:17] <%psidefx> You can main pot in this game where do i sign?
[4:51:18] <NotHereToStream> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ don't shake hands with may players
[4:51:23] <$emptyantics> Ayyy 😎
[4:51:26] <zenith0111> GET EM
[4:51:30] <%Josef_Stryker> Has anyone picked him at all in the stream?
[4:51:30] <FullMetalSnorlax> Eventually I stopped trying
[4:51:32] <+Shishi1205> bite his pecs
[4:51:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @NotHereToStream don't look them in the eyes
[4:51:37] <Kongro_> Hello fellas, how's the Nago buffs?
[4:51:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Like all Grappler Mains don't smoke
[4:52:02] <+Shishi1205> cant megafist your way thorugh in this beta pal
[4:52:02] <Pookiedaexzile> What buffs
[4:52:11] <$emptyantics> Good shit
[4:52:14] <+gg_aleph> bite was super buffed
[4:52:21] <andre11dr> Yeah i was in  the line but fuck it ,there's no way, I'd rather just watch
[4:52:39] <MagumaDono> just air dust
[4:52:42] <MagumaDono> fall on his head
[4:52:51] <+Hitorio> Potemkin has a strategy?
[4:53:00] <MagumaDono> He SHOULD
[4:53:00] <+Hitorio> and he thinks of it?
[4:53:04] <+MrAtheGreat> holy shit woolie is WAY better with Nago than he was a month ago
[4:53:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Bite is better, but if your 50 percent, using BG bascially is giving the enemy a 1 shot kill if they can last 2 seconds
[4:53:07] <andre11dr> @hitorio The good ones
[4:53:10] <Frothy_Milkshakes> Yes, pots strat is simply AGRESS
[4:53:11] <MagumaDono> Ouch...
[4:53:13] <+Shishi1205> blown up
[4:53:21] <MagumaDono> A sad day for us Pots
[4:53:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Faster health drain means less health taken, but its gone quicker
[4:53:33] <Frothy_Milkshakes> RIP fellow pot boi nice tries
[4:53:49] <pedrobs28> thanks for the matches maguma(giovanna)
[4:53:55] <Arina_Beam> what floor are you on Woolie?
[4:53:57] <%Josef_Stryker> The subtitle/JP version of that winquote sounds so dumb. "You would have won if you didn't lose"
[4:53:58] <MagumaDono> Aay GGs @pedrobs28!
[4:53:59] <+Iamdenril> his quote really says "you would've won had you not lost"
[4:54:02] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> The road of a Pot main is a rough one.
[4:54:08] <Dragon_Batman> Yooo I-no

[4:54:10] <zenith0111> I-No PogChamp
[4:54:10] <+Hitorio> You would have won if you didn't not win.
[4:54:18] <andre11dr> I still pondering if this Pot is scarier or the +R version
[4:54:27] <Pookiedaexzile> I kinda liked that version tho
[4:54:30] <Saltmeisterr> damnit
[4:54:30] <+Hitorio> I like Potemkin's +R theme
[4:54:31] <Deko_> LUL
[4:54:33] <Dragon_Batman> xD
[4:54:34] <Saltmeisterr> no Leo's
[4:54:35] <Saltmeisterr> rip
[4:54:36] <MagumaDono> What a real ass name
[4:54:36] <%Sparkseid> nice
[4:54:38] <zenith0111> "You only won because I lost"
[4:54:38] <FacetiousAF> bottom bitches let's gooooooo
[4:54:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh boy i-no mirrors
[4:54:42] <%Josef_Stryker> At least the English Line makes it so much better: "If you trained more you wouldn't gotten bodied so hard"
[4:54:42] <+gg_aleph> @pookiedaexzile still a buff, you were fucked before if your blood gauge emptied. Now there's a chance to replenish it
[4:54:42] <Frothy_Milkshakes> nice
[4:54:43] <Pookiedaexzile> it seemed Zen like saying "It is what it is
[4:54:49] <Dragon_Batman> It totally is
[4:54:53] <velgaduere> LET IT ROCK
[4:54:57] <+Shishi1205> double I-No for sure
[4:54:59] <%Sparkseid> aw
[4:55:00] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Far as I'm concerned, if I land a Buster I won the match.
[4:55:07] <+yeknomlive> someone better land the super
[4:55:07] <Saltmeisterr> uh oh
[4:55:14] <$emptyantics> Guys, i’ve never liked I-No or her design
[4:55:17] <Saltmeisterr> theres gonna be a lot of moaning
[4:55:18] <NotHereToStream> stroke the tree
[4:55:19] <+Hitorio> "Confucius say: it is what it is"
[4:55:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> pure chaos on screen
[4:55:21] <Pookiedaexzile> @b_aleph Can't build it back if your dead,
[4:55:22] <+Shishi1205> she looks so rad
[4:55:31] <+Hitorio> @emptyantics What about it is off-putting for ya?
[4:55:32] <andre11dr> Man I- No looks so good
[4:55:39] <+yusefHD> is it bottom beach time
[4:55:43] <%Josef_Stryker> As someone new to the series I think I-No looks way better with the extra clothing compared to her past designs.
[4:55:49] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it's real close
[4:55:49] <andre11dr> I kinda forgot how cool I-No was
[4:56:02] <Saltmeisterr> u can use it on whiff tho
[4:56:05] <+yeknomlive> it's tiny
[4:56:07] <user_naim> Wider hat is such an improvement
[4:56:15] <Pookiedaexzile> You see theres two types of people in this world: I-no and Ram faithful, and May Heathens
[4:56:19] <+Hitorio> I like her red color and her witch hat.
[4:56:23] <+Shishi1205> I got hit just by the projectiles I was super confused when I saw it first time
[4:56:24] <KeiPrime> its the glasses. i-no with glasses is chef's kiss
[4:56:36] <%Josef_Stryker> Did she ever have the butt cape?
[4:56:37] <+Shishi1205> I thought she had whiffed
[4:56:43] <+gg_aleph> @pookiedaexzile true, but youdbe dead anyway. I'm not saying he's super strong or anything,  but I'd say he was the least nerfed of the cast. For a reason
[4:56:57] <velgaduere> I-Mo that's bullshit and you know it
[4:56:59] <andre11dr> I just find the concept of time traveling rockstar so rad
[4:57:01] <velgaduere> I-No too
[4:57:04] <+Hitorio> I-No: A cover will never surpass the original. [DMC5's Subhuman exists]
[4:57:10] <Raven_In_A_Tree> the glasses are my least favorite part
[4:57:19] <andre11dr> I like the glasses
[4:57:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Taking 2 inches off the dude with the shortest....height, is still bad even if everyones equally fucked
[4:57:32] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Oh dude I wrote more in that message.
[4:57:36] <BlackermanZX> cover will never surpass the original... unless its Little V woolieMIRIN
[4:57:48] <user_naim> Heart Shaped Box up there with good covers
[4:57:49] <Pookiedaexzile> HE was already kinda bad,
[4:57:53] <Saltmeisterr> @Raven_In_A_Tree what the issue with the glasses?
[4:58:05] <+IHATREID> is willie playing online or vs roger?
[4:58:09] <Dragon_Batman> MAaaybe in the backyard after?
[4:58:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:58:11] <Pookiedaexzile> I still like his design tho
[4:58:23] <%Sparkseid> that's what i want, but im doubtful
[4:58:32] <Raven_In_A_Tree> @saltmeisterr they suck, the frames are lame karen glasses. if they were Bayonetta glasses it'd be different
[4:58:34] <+UberWolfman> Japan devs being transparent? NEVER
[4:58:37] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Sorry to be that guy dude but I wrote A LOT more in my message. Including thanking you about getting me into fighting games.
[4:58:39] <%Frothy_Milkshakes> Coffee_And_Memes subscribed with Prime. 
[4:58:43] <Sol_Install> idk why they'll do that for a beta
[4:58:47] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Nothing will ever beat the KI S3 patch notes in front of a live audience.
[4:58:48] <SirRoyco> I hope they do that for their League game too, that would be awesome
[4:58:50] <+Hitorio> I dig Nagoryuki's design. Usually I'm relatively indifferent to designs, but Nagoriyuki's one of the ones that I actively think looks cool when I look at him
[4:58:52] <+Shishi1205> floor 10 ram
[4:58:57] <scrublord009> Japan has been opening up more so maybe.
[4:59:03] <andre11dr> @blackermanzx I could probably prove this wrong, but it's late and examples aren't coming up....
[4:59:07] <FacetiousAF> benis
[4:59:09] <velgaduere> 🅱️ enis
[4:59:10] <justachap> I hope people buy this for PC :(
[4:59:11] <%Sparkseid> benis
[4:59:11] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio Ooooh so you don't have bad taste your tongue is dead
[4:59:16] <+QueequegTheater> "Numerous balance changes" Kappa
[4:59:19] <Saltmeisterr> bayonetta glasses wouldn't work for her design
[4:59:21] <Saltmeisterr> also benis
[4:59:23] <$emptyantics> I hope we get detailed patch notes in future games
[4:59:29] <+Shishi1205> Oh god the smash patches are super bad
[4:59:31] <+waltzqueen> @Hitorio he is pretty cool
[4:59:46] <$emptyantics> 🅱️enis
[4:59:50] <%Major_Lee_> hell yeah i use that Ram color
[5:00:09] <Raven_In_A_Tree> @saltmeisterr as a person who wears glasses, round ones are the worst
[5:00:19] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile I think it's moreso that my tongue prefers different stuff than most of the contents in BB or GG with some exceptions here and there
[5:00:20] <+yusefHD> anyone else thinks that she looks just like the journalist from Persona 5 MiniK
[5:00:26] <andre11dr> Why is Ram doing white face?
[5:00:29] <pedrobs28> she does
[5:00:39] <FacetiousAF> benis
[5:00:41] <+gg_aleph> @raven_in_a_tree depends on the face shape
[5:00:41] <Saltmeisterr> i love round glasses personally
[5:00:43] <%Sparkseid> got hit by the benis
[5:00:44] <BlackermanZX> buenis
[5:00:44] <+Hitorio> @yusefHD Ah. Shinya Ohya. The most popular waifu from P5 across the board.
[5:00:46] <%Josef_Stryker> Benis'd
[5:00:50] <+Hitorio> Wait.
[5:00:51] <Pookiedaexzile> @Hitorio Issa joke, You have great taste, you're watching woolie
[5:00:52] <+Hitorio> Her name isn't Shinya.
[5:00:56] <Saltmeisterr> from a visual perspective at least
[5:00:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> i-no slides away
[5:00:56] <+Hitorio> What the fuck is her name
[5:01:00] <+Shishi1205> lip flaps lmao
[5:01:05] <$emptyantics> I love how alot of the Valentines have the little bat monsters
[5:01:09] <+yusefHD> her name is chronic alcoholism
[5:01:16] <%Josef_Stryker> Ichiko
[5:01:19] <+Hitorio> @Pookiedaexzile Woolie
[5:01:20] <%Josef_Stryker> Ichiko Ohya
[5:01:24] <+Hitorio> Woolie's channel tastes pretty delish
[5:01:24] <%justmildlilac> Don't do Ino dirty like that by comparing her to useless journalist
[5:01:29] <%Sparkseid> always yes
[5:01:30] <Sol_Install> Always dunk
[5:01:38] <%psidefx> FOREEVER DUNK
[5:01:46] <NotHereToStream> goku? DUNK
[5:01:47] <+aishman> Never not dunk
[5:01:47] <%Nekros4442> THAT WAS SLICK
[5:01:48] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Hitorio
[5:01:50] <%Nekros4442> I"M STEALING THAT
[5:01:53] <%psidefx> MY roommates HATED IT
[5:02:09] <%Josef_Stryker> I used to hate/be indifferent towards Smell of the Game
[5:02:09] <+Shishi1205> damn moobot has hands
[5:02:20] <%Josef_Stryker> But now I'm practically singing along to the chorus
[5:02:27] <%Nekros4442> LIVE IN THE CORNER
[5:02:28] <andre11dr> Yeah, I'll be real chat, im one of those guys, don't care about the people in persona ,I'm much more into the Demon and god stuff then the waifus
[5:02:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Watch out she has 2 giant dangerous weapons
[5:02:33] <Saltmeisterr> BENIS
[5:02:36] <Raven_In_A_Tree> plus, ino wearing glasses takes away from her most unique trait besides her hat, which is her color changing eyes
[5:02:38] <+FuqBoiSlim> Moobot is damn cop
[5:02:38] <deceitfulgemini> how does one hate the smell of the game, it's better than aftertaste
[5:02:40] <+Shishi1205> no escaping the 🅱️ nis
[5:02:42] <+Hitorio> @andre11dr You sound like a Shin Megami Tensei kinda guy.
[5:02:50] <andre11dr> EXACTLY
[5:02:56] <%Josef_Stryker> BENIS'D

[5:29:41] <ReiterpallaschAC> @emptyantics It's the same Sol VA from before. lol
[5:29:42] <Dragon_Batman> I think for me it's how he reads his moves
[5:29:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie needs to get ready for Obama
[5:29:50] <+Hitorio> Perhaps Sol's VA is the collective human consciousness averaged out into a voice that is the exact median of all humanity.

[5:36:28] <%Nekros4442> PICK A TOP TIER WOOLIE
[5:36:29] <+RealThiele> BUSTAHHH
[5:36:30] <andre11dr> That's a 8-2 right there
[5:36:31] <Pookiedaexzile> He Got Buffed
[5:36:33] <mephium> and then they add command grab into taht mix too NotLikeThis
[5:36:35] <CosmoSire> Mr. Zoning at his finest 4Head
[5:36:42] <emptyantics> Thats a 9-1
[5:36:45] <Applecannon63> Nago is a real character
[5:36:46] <+Parrish_broadnax> thats "The Fear"
[5:36:47] <emptyantics> sumitoKEK sumitoKEK
[5:36:47] <%JaseAdrift> just pick a top tier woolie woolieMIRIN
[5:36:53] <Applecannon63> just difficult real
[5:36:54] <zenith0111> GGs
[5:37:03] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Nago's kit feels like it was designed to cull the weak.
[5:37:08] <andre11dr> Oh man, Nago vs Venom would be ROUGH
[5:37:23] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> One day only the strong Nago players will remain.
[5:37:23] <Applecannon63> nah Anji is a scrub killer
[5:37:27] <emptyantics> @andre11dr Fug that’d be painful to watch
[5:37:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Nago was designed bad, its okay to say
[5:37:33] <%Sparkseid> big facts
[5:37:34] <Pookiedaexzile> He looks really
[5:37:38] <+TopTieramisu> woolie "double down" madden
[5:37:38] <+Hitorio> The "my design appeals to you the most" traaaaaaaaaaap
[5:37:39] <Pookiedaexzile> good
[5:37:40] <%Sparkseid> just gotta make it work
[5:37:40] <zenith0111> @woolieversus Hope you had fun against my Axl ;P
[5:37:41] <NotHereToStream> like how you stuck with Darli in samsho
[5:37:47] <Picia000123> Oh yeah, Nago was designed to be bottom tier, no way around that
[5:37:58] <Deko_> wifi?
[5:37:59] <Applecannon63> Nago will be better tho
[5:38:02] <Dr_Mooose> oh
[5:38:02] <%Sparkseid> uh oh
[5:38:03] <+UberWolfman> "Why must every character I love be low tier" Woolie Madden
[5:38:19] <mephium> ping is fluctuating monkaS
[5:38:29] <+JustToWatch> it would be pretty easy to make nago top tier though
[5:38:30] <kulmoth> jesus that lag
[5:38:31] <Asuterisuku> In any other game Nago would be top tier. But this is Guilty Gear.
[5:38:34] <%Nekros4442> Someone is on Wifi
[5:38:35] <scrublord009> Wifi?
[5:38:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Which should tell the shit talkers, Woolie is legit, he's not doing bad
[5:38:40] <andre11dr> They should definitely nerf the built up on his blood ,it builts up to fast
[5:38:41] <emptyantics> Woolie’s other stand should be “Friends in low places”
[5:38:41] <+coldsama> Red bar warrior
[5:38:41] <%Mrthefro> Stop downloading porn
[5:38:52] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[5:38:53] <TimetodiveLTX> wifi players need to have extra delay forced on them
[5:38:53] <CosmoSire> @Asuterisuku I mean, he was, they had to nerf him 4Head
[5:38:58] <TimetodiveLTX> that's the only way.
[5:39:02] <DedlokPM> "My console is right next to the router."
[5:39:02] <+Hitorio> Let's see... Woolie's chars include: Blanka (SF4), Brown Dreds Chick (Samurai Shodown), Nago (GG Strive), and what else

[5:54:22] <CheyMix> she was zooming
[5:54:26] <NotHereToStream> man wish there was the take over replay function in this game
[5:54:32] <scrublord009> If you don't anti air the first one you done
[5:54:46] <+Hitorio> Never experienced the take over replay function, but it sounds like dope-ass training.
[5:54:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[5:54:47] <caprademonv2> whats that bar for under burst?
[5:54:47] <andre11dr> Controller disconnect?
[5:54:54] <andre11dr> Oh wait
[5:55:06] <andre11dr> LUL
[5:55:31] <+CaptainPyron> The power of instant training room with their character and their color. lol
[5:55:49] <+Hitorio> @CaptainPyron It's like putting a picture of your opponent on your punching bag.
[5:56:02] <+Hitorio> or your dartboard.
[5:56:10] <Smitteys867> @caprademonv2 It's RISC- it builds while you block hits, and the higher it gets the more damage you take. So basically, getting stuck in blockstun is scary if you cant get out
[5:56:13] <andre11dr> I think it safe
[5:56:19] <+CaptainPyron> @Hitorio Exactly what it is. It's the best.
[5:56:37] <andre11dr> At the right distance it's definitely safe if blocked
[5:56:47] <scrublord009> Air dash dust is so good for milia
[5:56:59] <%zenith0111> Why the engine noises sound louder
[5:57:54] <Smitteys867> @WoolieVersus what if you drift RC down after their airthrow?
[5:57:58] <NotHereToStream> maybe rc drift upwards?
[5:58:11] <%zenith0111> 5k of wall bounce?
[5:58:30] <andre11dr> Will the stab move work better?
[5:58:32] <Smitteys867> Hit the ground first and then juggle\
[5:58:42] <andre11dr> I think it's just H
[5:58:50] <NotHereToStream> you can rc drift in all 4 cardinal direction if you want to experiment
[6:00:09] <andre11dr> Actually yeah he could drift up and probably get something better
[6:00:16] <%TheBesteban> TheBesteban subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Busy this weekend, but don't think I won't come looking for you two post Strive release.
[6:00:28] <+CaptainPyron> Show me the good stuff, Ram player.
[6:00:36] <+TheBigMak> You know it's a Guilty Gear game when you look at the art and have no clue what's going on.
[6:00:37] <+Hitorio> Besteban's about to sprint into them cheeks.
[6:00:41] <%zenith0111> What does normal air throw give?
[6:00:42] <Saltmeisterr> oh we still strimmin?
[6:01:05] <+CaptainPyron> Ooh, her english voice is pretty good.
[6:01:15] <andre11dr> The corner again Ram ,oof
[6:01:23] <+Hitorio> Big step up from GG Sign's English Dub.
[6:01:29] <Dragon_Batman> Honestly for Eng Va, I find Sol is the only iffy one
[6:01:33] <Saltmeisterr> benis
[6:01:43] <Dragon_Batman> And it's more direction
[6:01:51] <+CaptainPyron> @Saltmeisterr I thought I was the only one hearing that.
[6:01:52] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:02:15] <+TheBigMak> I've been here for 2 minutes and I STILL don't know what is happening.
[6:03:01] <+CaptainPyron> Oh that went fast. I didn't even realize he lost a round.
[6:03:03] <andre11dr> I never got her wierd flesh teeth cape thing  it seems to be alive
[6:03:26] <+CaptainPyron> Some sort of weird bio tech maybe.
[6:03:30] <Ardisan_> @Dragon_Batman Agreed
[6:03:43] <+Hacerous> A man plays.. a god refuses to blink
[6:03:47] <Wiiplayah43> @andre11dr it is, it drools in Xrd
[6:03:55] <@Menitta> Aw
[6:03:59] <+Hitorio> @TheBigMak So there's this fighting game plot. Basically there's this high school girl except she's got huge boobs. I mean some serious honkers. A real set of badonkers. Packin some dobonhonkeros. Massive dohoonkabhankoloos.
[6:04:01] <NotHereToStream> no meter for faultless
[6:04:35] <anarchistPastry> @TheBigMak LUL
[6:04:58] <@Menitta> Run up throws is the only way to play
[6:05:12] <+Hacerous> NOM NOM NOM!
[6:05:14] <andre11dr> About to pop
[6:05:16] <Afrosamasenpai> LETS GO WOOLS
[6:05:21] <@Menitta> LUL
[6:05:28] <xpakeo> run up throw is true mix
[6:05:31] <emptyantics> Nice bite
[6:05:49] <+Saggitori> You're in their rhythm
[6:05:56] <@Menitta> Did the grab range decrease?
[6:05:57] <andre11dr> Run up throw is good, but run up wild trow
[6:06:09] <Ardisan_> Where Reggie go
[6:06:21] <@Menitta> @Ardisan_ curfew hit. had to leave
[6:06:23] <emptyantics> 🅱️enis

[6:06:26] <NotHereToStream> nice offense
[6:06:28] <Ardisan_> Ah

[6:07:04] <Afrosamasenpai> You did it!
[6:07:07] <+Hitorio> @CaptainPyron Or you could be friendly.
[6:07:07] <%zenith0111> N O M woolieSPICE
[6:07:10] <bhaysic> i-no is so fun in this game
[6:07:13] <NotHereToStream> acting like you won't get command grabbed
[6:07:21] <emptyantics> Good mixup
[6:07:30] <+CaptainPyron> @CaptainPyron What's more friendly than pure destruction?
[6:07:36] <Ardisan_> I can actually play Ino in this game
[6:07:41] <andre11dr> No wake up on both caracters so because who gets pressure gets to win
[6:07:44] <+Hitorio> @NotHereToStream [begins juggle] haa-ta-ehh [continues juggle]
[6:07:50] <+OrangeMDT> I need to take notes on this Nago o.o
[6:08:06] <+CaptainPyron> Time for the runback.
[6:08:25] <+Hitorio> @CaptainPyron You make a strong and inarguable point.
[6:08:35] <%zenith0111> When you go to training mode they spawn a avatar of you in your designated room so people can directly rematch if they wanted
[6:09:23] <whoguru5> nagoriyuki's theme slaps so hard SourPls
[6:09:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:09:30] <Saltmeisterr> still no leo tho
[6:09:44] <@Menitta> WOAH

[6:12:59] <scrublord009> Average seems 6/7
[6:13:00] <@Menitta> Granted i put barely any time in this beta
[6:13:06] <andre11dr> @menitta I believe you can bodie Woolie, his caracter is trash anyway, there's not chance for him

[6:16:25] <maznuts> Kappa
[6:16:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:16:42] <+CaptainPyron> I wonder who the first DLC characters will be.
[6:16:43] <%RaziWraith> Apparently Nago thinks IT'S TIME to slam kids on the ground LUL
[6:16:45] <%Josef_Stryker> So when does the full game release again?
[6:16:51] <+CaptainPyron> June 11.
[6:16:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> eat it
[6:16:57] <+UberWolfman> "Fuck them kids" Nagoriyuki
[6:16:58] <DedlokPM> @morow1ec "CHARGE!" is what she says for the TOTSUGEKI
[6:16:59] <%Josef_Stryker> Alright
[6:17:05] <emptyantics> I’m actually dissapointed with the launch roster if this game
[6:17:11] <+TheotherKristian> My first guilty gear game right now, how do I play people here?
[6:17:11] <%Josef_Stryker> Maybe I'll set some money aside to get it for my birfday
[6:17:11] <RAH001> sometimes my twitch sounds like an old vhs tape with the sound xD
[6:17:12] <andre11dr> I can't wait for Johnny to be top 3 and then get buffed ,it'll be sick Kappa
[6:17:14] <Dragon_Batman> God I can still here the Todidoki
[6:17:20] <nothuzad> June 11th is the release
[6:17:24] <Dragon_Batman> I think the Dolphin is doing it LUL
[6:17:25] <jahsmittsii> If center of my left thumb still had feeling I’d still be running matches rn
[6:17:29] <Applecannon63> Totsugeki means charge
[6:17:45] <+sonofthedeepsouth> yo
[6:17:46] <nothuzad> also characters having a bit smaller movesets should also make production cycles faster (+ more animations being tweened)
[6:17:52] <DedlokPM> @RAH001 that means you are at a low quality video
[6:17:52] <Dragon_Batman> Ahh that makes sense
[6:18:00] <+sonofthedeepsouth> yarrg pirates
[6:18:01] <Clyderso> The May crew PogChamp
[6:18:18] <%RaziWraith> can you die solely from blood charge or do you at least have to be tapped to death?
[6:18:20] <emptyantics> Woolie sandbagging
[6:18:26] <Dragon_Batman> Your left with 1
[6:18:38] <floralkami> hold up, does May yell out "FOOTSIES!" for one of her lows?
[6:18:40] <DedlokPM> @RaziWraith life drain won't kill. stops at 1
[6:18:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Riso has downloaded woolie
[6:18:57] <emptyantics> @floralkami Yes
[6:19:24] <%Sparkseid> nice
[6:19:57] <floralkami> @emptyantics fucking hell, May is already so annoying; now they got her saying shit I'd say. fml
[6:19:58] <emptyantics> Are Instakills in the game?
[6:20:03] <floralkami> no
[6:20:04] <+OrangeMDT> He can react
[6:20:08] <andre11dr> No
[6:20:14] <nothuzad> as far as we know: no emptyantics
[6:20:17] <emptyantics> Damn
[6:20:29] <andre11dr> I don't think this game will have IK
[6:20:36] <floralkami> not in this stage. they plant to add IKs when the game has had some time to grow
[6:20:37] <+CaptainPyron> Hopefully sometime later, but probably not at release.
[6:20:39] <+OrangeMDT> The spinning sit down special is reactable
[6:20:44] <jubejube56> !
[6:20:48] <Applecannon63> No IK until the next installment of GGS
[6:20:49] <floralkami> @andre11dr they already confirmed it will
[6:20:50] <Asuterisuku> They MIGHT be in by the time the retail game drops, but not here.

[6:27:50] <ElPlasa> Warm take: Colours (faust) is #1
[6:27:51] <DedlokPM> @floralkami @Applecannon63 think he means why he is this IN THIS GAME not overall
[6:27:52] <%Wool> gg, didn't expect to run into you lol
[6:27:53] <LinxGG> does faust have more range?
[6:27:55] <floralkami> naw, Gio and Faust have the best themes in my opinion. RHCP and System of a Down
[6:28:04] <+Colby_DJ> that's true, that's true
[6:28:05] <+OrangeMDT> Almost there, but just missing the input
[6:28:08] <%CalderGaming> does neutral jump FD not deal with the new teleport
[6:28:16] <pitabears> vore command grab WutFace
[6:28:17] <+FoolyBoolyRev> colors is so good
[6:28:18] <johnbonne_> this match up seems like such a nightmare
[6:28:32] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Nago n Chipp best themes so far imo
[6:28:43] <ChemicalCris> Wow! Woolie's playing in English?!  i'm so happy he's giving it a chance!
[6:28:43] <andre11dr> Gio theme grew on me ,definitely like it more now
[6:28:45] <floralkami> @dedlokpm ah, true. still, go watch WoolieVersus™ on YouTube ™ for more GG Lore
[6:28:50] <andre11dr> It's just different
[6:28:52] <+Hitorio> @OrangeMDT Stir Dinner with Mr. Miyagi and you will master the art of the thorough half circle.
[6:29:12] <+sundayafternoon1> Was fighting May as Gio and that matchup felt impossible. the patience I had to have
[6:29:16] <+OrangeMDT> @hitorio bet
[6:29:30] <mirtosss> 6p?
[6:29:35] <Smitteys867> @ChemicalCris hes been playing with the dub all day actually
[6:29:39] <floralkami> may tests everyone's patience
[6:29:44] <%Wool> scalpel is very safe I think, you're just going to have to jump over
[6:30:01] <%Afterman_> i take it reggie had to go home?
[6:30:09] <andre11dr> It's always been relatively safe

[6:34:15] <+OrangeMDT> Holy
[6:34:16] <Hericknhx> damn, dub Millia sounds more agressive

[6:39:05] <%AyupaPupa> is the 6H gap punishable
[6:39:12] <scrublord009> I would just practice anti air first entry
[6:39:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Obama promised no more disconects with middle eastern matches but he was the president with most disconects Kappa

[6:41:48] <afictitiousforce> @sonofthedeepsouth fuck
[6:41:51] <jubejube56> Damn making Nago so reliant on the command grab just kinda makes the grab even more obvious

[6:47:18] <scrubkappalord> KUM
[6:47:18] <+HazeyPP> I FOUND EM
[6:47:23] <scrublord009> Block the rekka
[6:47:26] <Shardlab> @theuncrownedruler Everyone does
[6:47:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> fuck yeah phil
[6:47:36] <Ardisan_> Chipp is from America
[6:47:39] <Nikbottom> PHIL
[6:47:40] <Asuterisuku> Sal T. Runback
[6:47:42] <Ardisan_> America Japan
[6:47:48] <theuncrownedruler> He was speaking big Japanese when I was playing earlier.
[6:48:12] <DirtyMiser> This beta has english va on now
[6:48:13] <ChemicalCris> @theuncrownedruler different voice tracks
[6:48:21] <theuncrownedruler> They must have patched it in
[6:48:25] <Shardlab> You have to enable it in options
[6:48:27] <ITechedDat> new for this beta
[6:48:28] <ElPlasa> "rest in peaces" god what a fucking weeb I leve him
[6:48:33] <ITechedDat> you have to switch in optiuons
[6:49:18] <theuncrownedruler> I heard I-no say some spicy shit earlier today but I thought it was fake.
[6:49:19] <Asuterisuku> If they get hit by the blood burst in the corner can they punish the install?
[6:49:27] <%Wool> this MU looks so bad for Nago
[6:49:33] <DirtyMiser> Strive looks fun. I can't wait for this and KOF later
[6:49:42] <Ardisan_> Most matchups look bad for Nago is seems
[6:49:44] <Applecannon63> Eng I-no is much more vulgar
[6:49:51] <ChemicalCris> good
[6:50:50] <theuncrownedruler> I believe with Nago you have to utilize your dash cancels to maximize on opportunities
[6:51:19] <Ardisan_> The answer is 12
[6:51:22] <%AyupaPupa> answer? no this is chipp
[6:51:26] <maznuts> yeah woolie theress no answer in this game right now
[6:51:59] <Ardisan_> See I was gonna make a Answer joke but I knew yall would do it
[6:51:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[6:52:09] <+OrangeMDT> Desperately hoping they’ll adjust something about Nago’s movement. Jumping is the best option he’s got, and he’s like the worst char in the air
[6:52:25] <scrublord009> Blocking the rekkas and anti air jH would just end this dude but so fast
[6:53:08] <jubejube56> Lol yeah Nago
[6:53:10] <Ardisan_> Getting molly wopped
[6:53:11] <jubejube56> go be a ninja
[6:53:13] <Saltmeisterr> no :)
[6:53:17] <TheAzureOracle> God that's such a weird win quote
[6:53:18] <FlowLethal> he told him to find ninja way
[6:53:22] <Hericknhx> I get it Nago not having an air dash but at leas make him a little bit fast would help alot
[6:53:22] <pitabears> ninja vampire would be lit
[6:53:29] <Nikbottom> Nago as a ninja would be so dope
[6:53:53] <Advent_Child04> @woolieversus the beta is still active??
[6:53:58] <crimsonsaens> You could exit and go into training mode
[6:54:19] <Hericknhx> I think the sweep on the rekka is 0 on block
[6:54:25] <Hericknhx> so it's hard to punish

[6:54:36] <KenOniichan> can 6K work?
[6:54:39] <+HazeyPP> I'm trying to connect and it won't so you're fine Woolie
[6:54:50] <Dragon_Batman> Dang, so you just gotta try an beat the follow up huh
[6:54:57] <%Gamefriendly> @Advent_Child04 it came back around for this weekend
[6:55:04] <scrublord009> Overhead is negative
[6:55:05] <he1lhydra> the kick followup is death if you block it
[6:55:09] <TheAzureOracle> Oh yeah, this is a new beta
[6:55:19] <Advent_Child04> sweet!
[6:55:31] <+sundayafternoon1> also had a bug that if I matched make in training mode it would disconnect me from the mode. not lucky with this beta lol
[6:55:46] <PFlare> Wow, so that's just safe?
[6:55:48] <TheAzureOracle> Yeah that happens sometimes
[6:55:49] <Nikbottom> you can go from 1 to the overhead for a mix-up
[6:56:02] <mirtosss> just + throw?
[6:56:07] <%Josef_Stryker> Is the Chipp matchup giving Woolie the most trouble?
[6:56:26] <crimsonsaens> Yeah, the training mode matchmaking bug is weird
[6:56:29] <%Sparkseid> Chipp matchup is rough for nago
[6:56:52] <%Josef_Stryker> Fair
[6:56:52] <+ManOfReason> Timing just defend is still hard for me
[6:57:02] <%Kaito_Cam> Kaito_Cam subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Eyyyy 5 months
[6:57:05] <+Colby_DJ> What's the Millia match up like?
[6:57:13] <%Josef_Stryker> Who do u think is gonna end up being Nago's toughest matchup?
[6:57:29] <he1lhydra> chipp also has a command grab
[6:57:45] <he1lhydra> he's a "overload the senses" character
[6:58:08] <Sulliman34> airblock then throw maybe?
[6:58:09] <%AyupaPupa> that's sick though
[6:58:12] <+Colby_DJ> It looks cool as hell tho
[6:58:27] <%king_wragles> I'm seeing it go off, or at least starting, and just... not doing anything
[6:58:31] <Cpt_phantom> Cool af but not worth it, that sucks
[6:58:34] <+HazeyPP> Just waiting for my chance to strike lol
[6:58:34] <he1lhydra> he can act out of diagonal alpha blade too
[6:58:35] <leomc2> fun fact nagos 6k in 623h to teleport sideswitches
[6:58:35] <Sulliman34> IS it air blockable
[6:58:48] <+sundayafternoon1> just defending feels riskier than usual cause damage is so high
[6:59:19] <+HazeyPP> SHIT lol
[6:59:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:59:24] <%Kaito_Cam> Anyone else having issues with connecting to matches?
[6:59:32] <scrublord009> Not today
[6:59:37] <+HazeyPP> Should've struck faster
[6:59:39] <Nikbottom> Who is this man?
[7:00:00] <destinyspider> Hard to not be legit jealous of Sol and Millia. Those two can do legit rad shit whereas Chipp is here slogging around and being punishable as fuck for everything he does loo
[7:00:06] <%Kaito_Cam> I know my internet isn't  terrible and I'm using ethernet
[7:00:08] <crimsonsaens> @Kaito_Cam In the training mod matchmaking, yes
[7:00:24] <Sulliman34> ALREADY?!
[7:00:28] <Sulliman34> i hate the blood gauge
[7:00:30] <%king_wragles> Wow, so one sided. Buff Potemkin KAPPA
[7:00:37] <%zenith0111> I think you can challenge the 11th Floor
[7:00:39] <%king_wragles> I'll never get Kappa right
[7:00:42] <%king_wragles> OH COME ON
[7:00:46] <+sundayafternoon1> Gotta play with an inch of your life all the time as NAgo lol
[7:01:08] <TheVoltStrike> oh nyooo
[7:01:23] <ITechedDat> does FD still increase blockstun?
[7:01:52] <Aussie_Manny> Who will win; The Woolie or Show?
[7:02:31] <+cha0tic_klutch> Woolie on one tab, UFC on the other, it's fight night baby let's go!
[7:02:38] <Kataiser> Man he held off on the buster for a *while*
[7:02:38] <Aussie_Manny> that back breaker is so cool
[7:02:39] <jubejube56> Damn Pot could probably get away with a dash RC tho
[7:02:40] <Sulliman34> man i just hate how all nago had going for him was nuts damage and corner carry and they had to nerf it ;-; sure his grab is better but the ways he can get it certainly arent, and he still gets punished for playing the damn game
[7:03:18] <Aussie_Manny> Nago is stupid cool, gotdamn.
[7:03:49] <+hibiki847> my friend was so upset over the nagonerfs when we read them
[7:04:01] <TheVoltStrike> insane
[7:04:05] <aka_Jigawatt> LOL
[7:04:15] <ElPlasa> I clenched so hard
[7:04:16] <Aussie_Manny> You >
[7:04:45] <Sulliman34> i just dont really think the nerfs were needed :< it really feels like the devs are scared of new players going "this character can 1 shot me this game is stupid"
[7:04:51] <Ardisan_> Woolie really gets the Potemkin matchup
[7:05:16] <ElPlasa> Well, Pot is Pat's character so it makes sense
[7:05:28] <%TubeMan642> Holy shit Woolie is still going I left at like 7 pm
[7:05:31] <ChemicalCris> Woolie, are you liking the dub from what you've heard?
[7:05:36] <+hibiki847> @Ardisan_ is that matchup good for nago?
[7:05:41] <Ardisan_> Idk
[7:05:44] <+PrincessLuna85> hey all quick question im brand new to fighting games but looking to get in and im trying to find a good stick controller to use anyone have a recommendation?
[7:05:48] <scrublord009> Let my man into heaven
[7:06:01] <ElPlasa> 6P?
[7:06:03] <Aussie_Manny> FEGA MIST
[7:06:07] <MysteriousZKelroth> YO MAN GG
[7:06:14] <+HazeyPP> FUCK
[7:06:15] <Cpt_phantom> Sometimes you just gotta go for it, keep em on their toes
[7:06:16] <ElPlasa> dayum
[7:06:18] <MysteriousZKelroth> I WAS THE POT. CONGRATS
[7:06:20] <%Gamefriendly> @hibiki847 where did you read the nerfs?
[7:06:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[7:06:36] <Sulliman34> oh yeah how does 6P work on reaction
[7:06:38] <+hibiki847> @Gamefriendly my friend read them to me so i don't know where honestly
[7:06:45] <Aussie_Manny> Ohh! Ram!
[7:06:47] <Aussie_Manny> Let's go!
[7:06:47] <Shardlab> @MysteriousZKelroth Twas a good fight to watch
[7:06:48] <+HazeyPP> I tried ;-; Lol hope I get in next
[7:06:57] <Saltmeisterr> man those silverbacks got wiped out huh?
[7:07:08] <+HazeyPP> @mysteriouszkelroth Yeah good job man
[7:07:08] <Saltmeisterr> haven't seen a single leo
[7:07:24] <Sulliman34> they made leo much harder to get results with, so people arent flocking to him. hes still pretty alright tho
[7:07:25] <%Gamefriendly> @hibiki847 alright, i did a quick search and couldnt find em, thanks anyway
[7:07:29] <PFlare> Oof, aggressive Ram.
[7:07:30] <Aussie_Manny> oh noooo
[7:07:35] <Sulliman34> his pokes are good and his backturn stuff is still great
[7:07:39] <aka_Jigawatt> benis
[7:07:45] <kinggum41> this ram is very liberal with her swords
[7:07:54] <aka_Jigawatt> anyone know what shes actually saying
[7:07:55] <Ardisan_> Penis
[7:07:57] <Sulliman34> ramlethal has become liberal
[7:07:58] <$Giothegame> @PrincessLuna85 Best advice is to go with what feels comfortable to play. A lot of current fighting games are much more designed with console controllers in mind now
[7:08:00] <ElPlasa> Battle of the 2Ds
[7:08:08] <%Josef_Stryker> Probably Venus?
[7:08:34] <Aussie_Manny> omg the corner pressure
[7:08:36] <%king_wragles> Pop cost you
[7:08:36] <%Josef_Stryker> Benis'd
[7:08:39] <%Wool> no respect
[7:08:44] <aka_Jigawatt> you pop you get popped
[7:08:46] <Aussie_Manny> doodbenny
[7:08:58] <%AyupaPupa> doodbenny
[7:08:59] <%kewlmyc> I feel popping his blood thing just gets you killed earlier
[7:09:04] <aka_Jigawatt> FeelsNagoMan
[7:09:09] <kinggum41> 🅱️enis
[7:09:10] <$Giothegame> Otherwise Qanba makes somee good sticks
[7:09:21] <Cpt_phantom> Ram is gonna press buttons, for sure
[7:09:33] <+HazeyPP> 🅱️enis
[7:09:39] <Ardisan_> Penis
[7:09:42] <+Weeewer> game seems much louder than wools?
[7:09:42] <maznuts> those are some fast buttons in Ram
[7:09:43] <+Weeewer> just me?
[7:09:44] <Aussie_Manny> FeelsAwareMan
[7:10:06] <$emerald_poison> what floor we on boys?
[7:10:08] <Sulliman34> ram players really do be pressing that Slash button
[7:10:09] <ElPlasa> yo, she's playing +R sol pretty much lol
[7:10:12] <+hibiki847> @Weeewer game deffinitly louder but i can understand woolie
[7:10:22] <Ragnorok64> Is game sound intentionally way higher than his voice?
[7:10:25] <TheVoltStrike> was that the DP super?
[7:10:27] <scrublord009> Why air throw and not 6p?
[7:10:27] <Aussie_Manny> 4 air jabs LUL
[7:10:39] <Cpt_phantom> Jumping dashing and attacking, she’s going ham
[7:10:42] <Sulliman34> NO SWORDS FOR YOU MAM
[7:10:42] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it does
[7:10:47] <kinggum41> ram be SCRATCHIN
[7:10:53] <%king_wragles> lame
[7:10:57] <%Wool> the one and done lmao
[7:10:59] <Saltmeisterr> loser
[7:11:00] <Aussie_Manny> Cowaaaaaard
[7:11:04] <Sulliman34> can nago still do 2P > 214HS?
[7:11:07] <Cpt_phantom> And left
[7:11:10] <Cpt_phantom> Damn dude
[7:11:17] <scrublord009> Fuck this guy LUL
[7:11:21] <Asuterisuku> The training dummy taking the form of your last opponent is really cool.
[7:11:22] <kinggum41> do attacks beat grabs in this game
[7:11:25] <+kumaprime> nagoriyuki is super fun to play
[7:11:46] <Aussie_Manny> Oof. That hits on the 100th frame lmao
[7:11:59] <scrublord009> Can't you react from the air dash sigil?
[7:12:15] <scrublord009> Or is it hard?
[7:12:17] <ElPlasa> PUNISH
[7:12:52] <Sulliman34> nah. SS CAN link to 623 but you have to be pretty deep already. might be more prudent to go f.S > 214H > 623H if you have the blood to spend or really want wallcrash
[7:13:38] <%zenith0111> Lab the Axl zoning
[7:13:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[7:13:53] <+HazeyPP> K it ain't letting me fight cuz I'm a low level.
[7:14:04] <+HazeyPP> Enjoy y'all
[7:14:06] <+kumaprime> whoa, you can link 214 hs into dp?!
[7:14:10] <elysium1092> elysium1092 is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 6 in the channel!

[7:14:13] <dabeaminator> How long has he been streaming?
[7:14:21] <+HazeyPP> 6 hours
[7:14:22] <%Wool> @HazeyPP anyone can go to floor 10
[7:14:25] <Sulliman34> @kumaprime nagoryuki can special to special cancel at cost of highly increasing his blood gauge
[7:14:27] <%Wool> ?uptime
[7:14:42] <Dragon_Batman> 7hr
[7:14:58] <dundunsun> Did reggie go home?
[7:15:12] <dabeaminator> Dang, I got on expecting to catch a vod
[7:15:13] <Sulliman34> god, 100 ping and only 2 rollback frames really IS a thing of beauty tho
[7:15:22] <+HazeyPP> @wool He has it set to high players though every time I challenge him it won't let me fight him but like I say, hope y'all enjoyed the matches with him
[7:15:34] <+Hitorio> Reggie went back to Zanarkand
[7:15:51] <Sulliman34> oh wow, that dash is really good for burstbaiting
[7:16:02] <Sulliman34> i will say despite the nerfs, they REALLY buffed 214H
[7:16:05] <Sulliman34> that move is godly now
[7:16:08] <+Weeewer> geez that blood brain is insane. What does it give you? better frame data or just damage
[7:16:24] <%Josef_Stryker> Who's the most likely to be announced as DLC first?
[7:16:31] <Ardisan_> My mo
[7:16:33] <Ardisan_> m
[7:16:34] <+kumaprime> @sulliman34 oh, see I would do then do 214 hs. you're telling me that at the cost of blood buildup I can special to special cancel most of his specials?
[7:16:35] <scrublord009> Has anyone fought like super good INOs ?
[7:16:49] <+kumaprime> dp*
[7:16:55] <+TheotherKristian> As someone who has not played Fighting games since SFIV, I really like this game
[7:16:57] <ManaSpurt> @Josef_Stryker Johnny and baiken for sure
[7:17:11] <Sulliman34> @Weeewer neither. the blood gauge is a punishment for doing special moves or special to special cancelling. if it fills he enters a state where he can perform no special moves and will lose about half his total HP, unless he performs a super only useable in Blood Rage
[7:17:17] <+LevelUpSlick> that blood management is rough
[7:17:28] <PFlare> YO
[7:17:29] <Ardisan_> ABA and Bridget is the only DLC characters I want
[7:17:31] <NotHereToStream> NICE
[7:17:32] <Dragon_Batman> Noice
[7:17:32] <%Josef_Stryker> YEYEYEYEYE
[7:17:33] <aka_Jigawatt> YOOOOOO
[7:17:38] <anarchistPastry> YEYEYEYEAAAH
[7:17:38] <%Wool> Stroke the Big Tree is such an annoying move
[7:17:39] <%king_wragles> You just ruined their night
[7:17:39] <%Irridium> PogChamp
[7:17:40] <%TubeMan642> nice
[7:17:42] <Kingdom_of_Rot> Damn!
[7:17:42] <yourusernameistrash> Now this game looks fun.
[7:17:42] <maznuts> SOMEONE CLIP IT
[7:17:43] <%zenith0111> I-No things
[7:17:43] <%king_wragles> Stole em
[7:17:43] <maznuts> NOW
[7:17:45] <%thedankestmeeme> im wet rn
[7:17:47] <Cpt_phantom> Sick
[7:17:48] <scrublord009> Bodied
[7:17:49] <+polothegreatest> SeemsGood
[7:17:51] <+BettyMwwaahh> mopHype mopHype mopHype
[7:17:56] <timbob> damn he's good sajamGasm
[7:18:01] <+Weeewer> @Sulliman34 ah gotcha what i thought were rekkas are special cancels that he gets punished for. Neat gimmick
[7:18:01] <%zenith0111> GG
[7:18:05] <Sulliman34> @kumaprime yes, so as an ender nago can often perform 214HS > 623 HS, which will fill his blood gauge by about half or 2/3rds. the blood gauge will decrease by landing his command grab or landing sword based normals
[7:18:11] <%zenith0111> woolieSHOOK
[7:18:11] <%barkon345> its to balance the fact that he can cancle any of his moves into what ever the hell he wants
[7:18:35] <%zenith0111> Lag WutFace
[7:19:22] <Sulliman34> man that antidepressant scale only doing 1 hit isnt super useful
[7:19:43] <anarchistPastry> https://clips.twitch.tv/MoralPerfectShrimpJKanStyle-qky6IMXgEM8PLEUR
[7:19:52] <%zenith0111> The air version is faster so less hits
[7:19:53] <NotHereToStream> axl time
[7:19:59] <+enickma11> @Sulliman34 Hits multiples times depending on distance traveled
[7:20:04] <scrublord009> Gyaru INO KappaPride
[7:20:14] <Sulliman34> yeeee i know, i was just saying she did it so close i feel a dash would have been more prudent
[7:20:31] <NotHereToStream> got to learn to punish the Command grab
[7:20:33] <Sulliman34> i think a single hit antidepressant might actually be negative
[7:20:34] <Ardisan_> GOOD BOI
[7:20:37] <+kumaprime> @sulliman34 that's cool. I normally just command dash into command grab to reset the blood, I was just unaware I could cancel anything. damn nago is awesome
[7:20:38] <Asuterisuku> Eye to Eye is so GOOOOD
[7:20:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[7:20:43] <Ardisan_> OKAAAAAYY
[7:20:55] <%zenith0111> He can delay the ender or do it immediately
[7:20:59] <Ardisan_> MAI NO MAY
[7:21:03] <+Weeewer> Axl drives me insane. my worst match up easy
[7:21:09] <%zenith0111> When he goes YES! it does hella chip damage
[7:21:13] <Sulliman34> @kumaprime mmhm! also be aware that his 214HS is 0 on block now, and can also be used as a mixup into his command grab!
[7:21:27] <Sulliman34> jesus yeah thats like 5% chip damage
[7:21:33] <+Weeewer> this chip is nuts
[7:21:44] <%NeedlesD> NeedlesD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 12 month streak! 
[7:21:45] <aka_Jigawatt> EYE TO EYEEEEE
[7:21:46] <+kumaprime> @sulliman34 thanks for the info
[7:21:48] <Ardisan_> YOOO that chip
[7:21:50] <KenOniichan> id kill for a +R replay system in strive
[7:21:58] <Picia000123> that's why you gotta FD that blast, so you don't lose so much health there
[7:22:27] <%zenith0111> Its purely fullscreen
[7:22:49] <Ardisan_> Ight ima dip. Cya everyone.
[7:22:59] <%zenith0111> If you jump he can upswing
[7:23:01] <Sulliman34> i forget, does FD increase blockstun in strive or nah? im surprised the beta doesnt have a frame display but that might be since moves arent in their final states
[7:23:15] <Picia000123> do the anti air one for the mixup
[7:23:18] <Sulliman34> does 214HS alone get you out of there?
[7:23:24] <Picia000123> so you can get used to that one too
[7:23:52] <%zenith0111> Ans Rensen upswing pulls them all the way in and if closer will cross you up
[7:23:56] <%zenith0111> and*
[7:24:00] <ElPlasa> the dash should have some form of invincibility, kinda like slayer's

[7:24:36] <Sulliman34> COMMIT
[7:24:46] <%zenith0111> HE DELAY EVEN FURTHER
[7:25:01] <Sulliman34> does he get you with upswing if you superjump tho
[7:25:05] <jubejube56> Is rensen into explosion a blockstring?
[7:25:12] <shnorkk> Unrelated but Octo really nailed Axl
[7:25:26] <%zenith0111> @jubejube56 Basically but after that its RPS zoning
[7:25:50] <jubejube56> Ahh neat
[7:26:26] <helixidron> the jump is a read, i guess
[7:26:32] <helixidron> hoping he'll do it again
[7:26:49] <Picia000123> you are minus after the block
[7:26:55] <Sulliman34> how high does the explosion hitbox go? maybe you can just forward jump and block so upswing pulls?
[7:26:56] <%zenith0111> Its a guessing game for sure
[7:26:57] <Picia000123> Axl is plus
[7:27:16] <Applecannon63> I wonder since we have an english dub who will voice A.suka R. K.reuz?
[7:27:26] <Sulliman34> no way upswing is plus at that height
[7:27:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[7:27:40] <Sulliman34> i stand corrected
[7:27:43] <$razielhex> holy shit; Woolie's been getting into fighting gmes for 7 hours
[7:27:47] <$razielhex> !motivted
[7:27:51] <Sulliman34> oh shit its the ram again
[7:27:52] <%zenith0111> He can 2K 2D snail after upswing
[7:27:55] <%king_wragles> They keep saying Daredevil just showed up, but I don't see him anywhere
[7:28:12] <%Wool> Octopimp is trying to find you, Woolie
[7:28:14] <point4effort> He's the one holding the camera.
[7:28:30] <Applecannon63> Venus
[7:28:33] <+Weeewer> i wish the blue ram skin didnt have white skin. I love my color but I dont wanna be an undeniable monster

[7:29:17] <point4effort> Applied science.
[7:29:23] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> The power of science!
[7:29:28] <scrublord009> Woolie knew
[7:29:31] <+Weeewer> Super chips do kill, but you can Faultless Defend them with meter @Josef_Stryker
[7:29:31] <Sulliman34> @Josef_Stryker i believe everything will chip kill if you dont faultless defense
[7:29:34] <+legendaryheroxx> @Josef_Stryker everything

[7:32:38] <shnorkk> Now octo wins no matter what Kappa
[7:32:45] <jubejube56> If you play pot but voice axl then you can never lose the pot axl matchup
[7:32:53] <NotHereToStream> unga time
[7:32:57] <%zenith0111> If he procs one vision just block hes always safe
[7:33:09] <Evendrag> i expected a more brute sounding sol but ehh...
[7:33:10] <%king_wragles> I'm slowly realizing this guy is a vampire samurai
[7:33:16] <Sulliman34> i dont like how high sol's english voice is
[7:33:24] <PFlare> @king_wragles He was trained by Slayer.
[7:33:33] <Sulliman34> he sounds like off brand johnny yong bosch
[7:33:33] <%king_wragles> That super adds up actually
[7:33:42] <Sulliman34> GOD THAT f.S IS GROSS
[7:34:03] <Zombrocom> Baaaan dit~
[7:34:04] <Sulliman34> this sol really doesnt wanna burst
[7:34:12] <Saltmeisterr> he sounds like fucking blast man from megaman 11

[8:08:16] <@Moobot> @DDDorsett WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 8 hours and 15 minutes
[8:08:19] <+yusefHD> LA PEUR
[8:08:21] <NotHereToStream> i guess woolie is downloaded
[8:08:26] <%Major_Lee_> SOCIETY
[8:08:26] <DDDorsett> Jeez. 8 HOURS?!
[8:08:30] <Sulliman34> you are not neutral after that
[8:08:55] <DDDorsett> Y'all realy like the POT Church of good will
[8:09:00] <+glgzephyr> @Sulliman34 Actually, you are. You only get knocked down if you're wall broken with a super
[8:09:02] <+ValkyrieProfiling> Octo is terrifying with Pot
[8:09:14] <Sulliman34> @glgzephyr oh interesting, good to know though
[8:09:31] <scrublord009> Where's the pat runback? Kappa
[8:09:38] <+OrangeMDT> Oh no... Woolie is free now
[8:09:48] <NotHereToStream> woolie will figure pot out
[8:09:49] <Afrosamasenpai> "Nago's really strong" - Octo
[8:09:58] <Afrosamasenpai> Progress!
[8:10:01] <+glgzephyr> @Sulliman34 Yeah if your character can wall break with super, you should always use it when able. The advantage you get is so worth
[8:10:03] <Zombrocom> The nago life is a hard life
[8:10:39] <Afrosamasenpai> let me in tho
[8:10:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[8:10:39] <NotHereToStream> i usually bait the hammerfall for free punish
[8:10:40] <%Josef_Stryker> Does Woolie still need to do Heaven Qualifying matches?
[8:10:43] <+glgzephyr> I mean, he can if he has 50 meter LUL
[8:11:37] <Afrosamasenpai> @Josef_Stryker Nope. He's out. I think. Bugs are weird.
[8:11:40] <+glgzephyr> bad pot player use Hammerfall to approach in neutral, while good ones either cancel it in neutral or punish buttons with it
[8:11:49] <Zombrocom> That's 5K
[8:12:07] <+yusefHD> I'm surprised there isn't a play from this point of the replay mode
[8:12:16] <Ethrion> oh it's octo
[8:12:30] <NotHereToStream> does nago have a natural back dash?
[8:12:37] <doctordinkus> i love how I tune in like 7 hours later and woolie is still playing, reggie evaporated
[8:12:42] <+maj__> octoBonk
[8:12:50] <Zombrocom> That one was 2D
[8:12:54] <Afrosamasenpai> That's sweep, not 5K.
[8:12:57] <jubejube56> Are Nago projectiles even worth it unless they are used in a combo now?
[8:13:00] <Misterjablez> Nago does have a small back dash yea
[8:13:07] <jubejube56> Or getting the last bit of damage now
[8:13:13] <NotHereToStream> hmm
[8:13:38] <Misterjablez> Nope, they cost way too much now. They do some damage and can counter some projectiles but that is it
[8:14:07] <%kyh9> When's GG vs Mahvel
[8:14:15] <Misterjablez> Before you could use one to cover your approach by cancelling into fukyo or his spin attack but it's expensive now
[8:14:37] <%kyh9> Woolie is PROPERLY in a flow state
[8:14:56] <defaultname3887> we hard labbing?
[8:15:00] <NotHereToStream> all about conditioning
[8:16:20] <Ethrion> so close
[8:16:22] <Dragon_Batman> A shame he caught that
[8:16:30] <NotHereToStream> yeah, pot whiffing his super and still get a freebie sucks
[8:16:32] <+CrmznOgre> u lost but not destroyed phew
[8:16:44] <Zombrocom> Yeah HPB has no recovery, it's pretty much a metered super jump
[8:16:59] <Misterjablez> I have a really hard time hitting with dust
[8:17:18] <NotHereToStream> I usually cover my dust with gunflame rc
[8:17:39] <Misterjablez> Nago doesnt have gunflame tho lol
[8:17:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[8:17:54] <NotHereToStream> he can't RC his projectile ?
[8:18:12] <+M08Xrd> Respect the Blood Rage
[8:18:16] <Dragon_Batman> He can but I don't think he is quick enough to capatilze
[8:18:26] <NotHereToStream> nago truly has a hard lif
[8:18:27] <Dragon_Batman> At least depending on the range
[8:18:28] <NotHereToStream> life*
[8:19:13] <%kyh9> YEEEEEE
[8:19:18] <%kyh9> God, this game is even fun to WATCH
[8:19:28] <jubejube56> I also think you can command grab pot out of the reflector thing for whatever that’s worth
[8:20:24] <NotHereToStream> i dump my meter into random RC just to control the neutral
[8:20:32] <Misterjablez> @notheretostream His life got harder in this beta, his blood meter fills up way faster and his blood rage is so short you can barely do anything before you run out of time, it's free 50% hp for the opponent if they're not an idiot
[8:20:33] <+CrmznOgre> oof
[8:20:35] <%kyh9> The momentum from the good call carried him
[8:21:03] <NotHereToStream> @Misterjablez damnm asw done nago dirty
[8:21:43] <jubejube56> They buffed fukyo and bloodsucking universe to compensate but at least thus far it seems to be a net negative
[8:22:17] <NotHereToStream> 2hs?
[8:22:19] <+OrangeMDT> Really wish you could end Nago’s medium combo into the 6h
[8:22:19] <+loukemia83> Strive needs the +R match replays real bad
[8:22:34] <Zombrocom> With last betas blood gauge and this betas command grab nago might actually be a real character
[8:22:59] <Misterjablez> Yea
[8:23:07] <NotHereToStream> a lot pot does the butt slam attack on the way down, you have to watch out
[8:23:24] <Misterjablez> Cuz before he was hard but the meter management had enough push and pull to be fun, now I'm walking on eggshells to just not die
[8:23:38] <NotHereToStream> 6p?
[8:23:49] <OverheadOctopuss> they should buffed his damage to go along w the blood nerf
[8:24:02] <%Brightstreak> does 6p work?
[8:24:12] <jubejube56> I presume the blood meter nerf also reduces how much of a “one shot” character he is
[8:24:25] <Dragon_Batman> Nice
[8:24:27] <NotHereToStream> slap that cheek
[8:24:34] <%Brightstreak> least I could do after you whooped my ass earlier today
[8:24:41] <+saltpiggu> i can react with 2H on that super whiff
[8:24:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[8:24:50] <Misterjablez> Or at least give him some tools. Like let him dash or something in blood rage to force a mistake to capitalize on. Cuz the other person can very easily just stay away

[8:25:22] <+OrangeMDT> 624h is also an anti-air, if you have blood to spare
[8:25:25] <FirewallStorm> give him a spanking for showing his butt
[8:25:42] <Sulliman34> what move is 624H?
[8:26:03] <+saltpiggu> 624 is not a move
[8:26:12] <Sulliman34> maybe they meant 623
[8:26:17] <Zombrocom> Pretty sure he meant 623
[8:26:19] <+saltpiggu> he means 623
[8:26:29] <+OrangeMDT> @sulliman34 should be 623. Got my num pad messed up
[8:26:32] <+saltpiggu> his double slash
[8:26:33] <357Sneak> marrMarnkaS EYE 2 zyzxCOOL Eye lytEYES
[8:26:40] <%Brightstreak> mash back. he moves the screen
[8:26:43] <Dragon_Batman> Who knew such a big boi would be so wily LUL
[8:26:49] <+M08Xrd> Keep it real
[8:26:49] <Sulliman34> @OrangeMDT happens!
[8:26:51] <+saltpiggu> that move is really good i just forget to use it
[8:26:56] <NotHereToStream> get out of jail super
[8:26:56] <Zombrocom> It's a free get inm
[8:27:05] <Zombrocom> Metered super jump
[8:27:05] <jubejube56> Nago wishes he could get such air
[8:27:13] <Afrosamasenpai> With those legs I hope it's full screen
[8:27:21] <Sulliman34> imagine both your supers having utility
[8:27:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> 8 HOURS? Marathon Man Woolie over here
[8:27:50] <+saltpiggu> fireball
[8:27:58] <Misterjablez> One thing I still need to figure out with Nago is how to deal with super fast characters like chipp that literally just never stop, cuz unfortunately to make up for all the damage Nago does even his fastest attacks are pretty slow
[8:27:59] <Sulliman34> today i found out leo's backturn super will be stopped by a single may beach ball ;w;
[8:28:03] <%Brightstreak> you can invulnerability dash through it. if nago has one of those dashes
[8:28:05] <NotHereToStream> you dashed into his start up and ate all of it
[8:28:19] <Misterjablez> Nago's dash is not invuln sadly
[8:28:20] <Zombrocom> You blocked the start up hit
[8:28:36] <+RowenCleric> love seein labbing like this to figure ihm out, has helped me a lot
[8:28:37] <Sulliman34> @Misterjablez 5p and 2p are gonna be your best friends. 5P can go into 6P > 214HS, and 2P can go right into 214HS
[8:28:46] <%Brightstreak> can you air dash past it?
[8:28:49] <+saltpiggu> fireball and blocking is good cause it keeps his pursuit off
[8:28:57] <Misterjablez> Nago has no air dash @brightstreak
[8:29:08] <+M08Xrd> Air dash LUL
[8:29:11] <Dragon_Batman> These two do not have that lol
[8:29:12] <KenOniichan> lmao
[8:29:13] <%townzzzzz> Kappa
[8:29:26] <+M08Xrd> lmao
[8:29:27] <NotHereToStream> uh does nago f.s have a hurtbox?
[8:29:28] <%Brightstreak> ah lol I have zero knowledge about him. thanks
[8:29:28] <Picia000123> Nagoriyuki does not even have double jump
[8:29:30] <Misterjablez> @sulliman34 Sadly even those aren't fast enough in some situations I've been in
[8:29:31] <357Sneak> WEE --_- FBtouchdown
[8:29:34] <308caliber> 50 % meter for an air dash LUL
[8:29:35] <Sulliman34> "hows nago's air game?" "not good" "oh ok hows his ground game?" "pretty alright"
[8:29:39] <+Weeewer> omg youre wave dashing
[8:29:40] <+CrmznOgre> What is this "air dash" witchcraft that you speak of?
[8:29:40] <Picia000123> he has worse mobility than Potemkin LUL
[8:29:42] <+Weeewer> Woolie plays melee now
[8:29:44] <+saltpiggu> 214h is better for that
[8:29:48] <+Celarious> Broke: Actually figuring a way to answer Pot barrier Woke: popping blood and home run swinging through it
[8:29:59] <Sulliman34> @Misterjablez all depends on what move youre blocking! but yeah i feel you, i played around the cast today to get a break from yuki and it was kinda nice ;w;
[8:30:05] <%Brightstreak> double jump?
[8:30:12] <NotHereToStream> does nago have a low hurtbox attack?
[8:30:15] <Zombrocom> No double jump either
[8:30:15] <Dragon_Batman> Doesn't have that either
[8:30:16] <Misterjablez> His super jump has startup frames to, to really hammer home that he does not like to be in the air lol
[8:30:18] <Zombrocom> This is NAGO yo
[8:30:22] <%Sparkseid> no double jump
[8:30:23] <Dragon_Batman> He is super grounded
[8:30:37] <%Brightstreak> oooh. super heat knuckle height. good to know
[8:30:39] <+CrmznOgre> He's a little mac
[8:30:40] <+saltpiggu> good normals in the air
[8:30:40] <Zombrocom> The nago life is the HARD LIFE
[8:30:45] <%Brightstreak> gotcha gotcha
[8:30:46] <Mattais88> Not true, he gets fucked in the air
[8:30:49] <NotHereToStream> how about the weird spin attack
[8:30:53] <%Josef_Stryker> He's essentially a glass tank
[8:30:58] <+saltpiggu> fireball to stop pursuit is best answer i think
[8:31:03] <pi_in_the_sci> Samurai = grounded
[8:31:08] <%Josef_Stryker> Gotta strike with precision like a true Samurai woolieSMUG
[8:31:16] <Aydarkzero> just don't get hit 4Head
[8:31:21] <NotHereToStream> that sucks, Sol can vortex under the aegis
[8:31:25] <Dragon_Batman> Ye Nago just kinda has to deal
[8:31:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Blood Rage Super?
[8:31:30] <jubejube56> It would be cool if fukyo could go through it but that’s just damage waiting to happen
[8:31:34] <FirewallStorm> could you dash through it with their blood dash
[8:31:39] <%Brightstreak> isn't there a move where you send your image and teleport to it? or am I crazy?
[8:31:41] <+saltpiggu> its a super
[8:31:43] <Ragnorok64> feels like he's accidentally in the wrong game
[8:31:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[8:31:47] <+Celarious> It keeps him from advancing at least
[8:31:47] <Bamcrash> Can you 5h then teleport back
[8:31:52] <+Weeewer> i think the projectile move is the best bet since it at least keeps Pot from advancing as much?
[8:31:52] <+OrangeMDT> His super jump might as well be nearly full screen, if they’re only gonna give him one, slow jump
[8:31:54] <Misterjablez> Nago is hard but dammit if he isn't fun. And I love his personality. In the japanese voice his battle cries sound like he's as much fun as you are when you go ham
[8:31:57] <+saltpiggu> so stiffing it gives you meter advantage
[8:32:00] <NotHereToStream> the only time you manage to do something is when you went into blood rage and did a super
[8:32:00] <%Josef_Stryker> So what makes Blood Mode worth the risk? Because the health drain is ridiculous from what I've seen? Is the damage also absurd?
[8:32:12] <+NopeBadguy> Can you not poke past it with like 5s or 2h?
[8:32:13] <+MeyB_7> but he walks with it and air grabs you
[8:32:22] <Zombrocom> Blood rage isn't worth any risk. It's a penalty. You DO NOT want to be in it.
[8:32:22] <NotHereToStream> bad trade too
[8:32:24] <Misterjablez> @brightstreak What you're thinking of is he sends a little mirage of himself out as a projectile
[8:32:29] <+Celarious> @Josef_Stryker Home run swing can just instakill you if you actually land it
[8:32:39] <Bamcrash> Dang
[8:32:45] <Dragon_Batman> Most of the time it'll be like mid or late game so the health isn't enough to play with right?
[8:32:52] <+Megaxbones> blood dash back after 5h?
[8:32:55] <+MeyB_7> it follows you full screen? that sucks
[8:32:56] <+Weeewer> honestly he only does 10% more to you than you do to him
[8:32:59] <%Wool> Dang Woolie how long are you playing
[8:33:00] <+NopeBadguy> can you not poke past with 5s or 2h?
[8:33:02] <+saltpiggu> can you dash through it
[8:33:03] <%CalderGaming> can you just guard it a few times for the meter gain?
[8:33:03] <+Weeewer> You made him waste a bar for it, so good trade imo
[8:33:08] <RadicalEssay> j.5D?
[8:33:10] <+CrmznOgre> NOPE
[8:33:13] <Dragon_Batman> His dash doesn't have i frames
[8:33:18] <NotHereToStream> uh jump dust?
[8:33:29] <NotHereToStream> dust keeps him suspended in the air no?
[8:33:29] <+Weeewer> oh yeah does he have a jump up dust
[8:33:33] <Dragon_Batman> Super jump then jump dust?
[8:33:33] <jubejube56> Lol imagine having an air dash
[8:33:33] <wibbwobbler> Oh wow that’s kind of rough
[8:33:37] <Misterjablez> One nice thing about blood rage is if you land a 5H, you can RC into 5H and then link into the blood rage super if you have full meter. 85ish% hp. It will instant kill a chipp
[8:33:38] <%CalderGaming> if you jump over it you're begging for an AA grab
[8:33:46] <Misterjablez> It basically never happens though
[8:33:48] <%X2Eliah> Is it bad to just block/hold against the barrier?
[8:34:01] <+Celarious> Yeah I think the best option is just throwing out the shadow clone so he can't advance with the barrier
[8:34:11] <Dragon_Batman> True
[8:34:15] <maznuts> man poor nago
[8:34:15] <+NopeBadguy> The answer is don't be in this scenario @WoolieVersus
[8:34:15] <+Weeewer> shadow clone best answer, keeps him in block stun
[8:34:17] <NotHereToStream> the answer: tell asw to nerf pot :)
[8:34:17] <+OrangeMDT> Yeah Woolie, this is where we hope for another Nago buff at/soon after release
[8:34:40] <Picia000123> you just have to respect it
[8:34:48] <jubejube56> .....today I was reminded that Nago has a jump dust
[8:34:51] <Misterjablez> Honestly all they need to do is revert the blood gauge and blood rage changes and he'd be fine
[8:35:13] <%Wool> !uptime
[8:35:13] <@Moobot> @Wool WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 8 hours and 42 minutes
[8:35:18] <Dragon_Batman> Gotta give it so much repsect like you owe him money and he's a loan shark
[8:35:23] <%Brightstreak> 2136k?
[8:35:28] <NotHereToStream> not really worth spending 50 tension to avoid it
[8:35:34] <NotHereToStream> may aswell walk up and block it
[8:35:35] <+Celarious> If he tries to follow with the barrier he's gonna eat the shadow clone
[8:35:36] <%dreadedcthulhu> would IBing the projectile help?
[8:35:44] <Dragon_Batman> Ih dash
[8:35:48] <%Brightstreak> sorry 236k fukyo
[8:35:48] <+saltpiggu> waisting 50 meter to get over a super would still be a bad trade
[8:35:57] <jubejube56> Yeah guess it’s just Pots turn
[8:35:57] <+Axellogic> Are ya winning son?
[8:36:00] <Dragon_Batman> Dash can usually get punched
[8:36:08] <wibbwobbler> Projectile might cover you as he walks towards you
[8:36:11] <FirewallStorm> maybe the best thing is to just trade
[8:36:17] <%Brightstreak> ok
[8:36:22] <Misterjablez> Yea it sadly has no invuln in the fukyo. You'd think it would but nag
[8:36:24] <Misterjablez> nah
[8:36:26] <+Weeewer> i think the trade is the best thing
[8:36:27] <Dragon_Batman> If it had I frames then shure
[8:36:35] <AhmCha> did Nago get nerfed
[8:36:36] <+Weeewer> the trade at least keeps pot from advancing on you
[8:36:40] <%yves_is_online> yves_is_online subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! one year :)
[8:36:48] <+M08Xrd> Nago's playing his own game
[8:36:50] <CupsCommander> The more I think about the changes to Nago (other than the command grab), the more I wonder if the devs know what they are doing with this character.
[8:37:07] <%Wool> wished I could have been the Gatekeeper but Octo wanted to play you lol
[8:37:10] <jubejube56> Sometimes the lab grants us no salvation
[8:37:23] <+hibiki847> @jubejube56 only pain
[8:37:30] <jubejube56> :(
[8:37:45] <+Axellogic> Whos got the keys
[8:37:47] <mothdude> What about Gaslight and Girlboss?
[8:38:02] <Poryizard> Is chicken blocking a thing in this game? and would it help the situation against that super?
[8:38:06] <+hibiki847> oh hey may my main, im still bad but i feel like i can move
[8:38:13] <Dragon_Batman> Fuck
[8:38:14] <+saltpiggu> 6p
[8:38:15] <+Celarious> hehe funny dolphin go fullscreen
[8:38:16] <NotHereToStream> unlimited dolphin works
[8:38:24] <+M08Xrd> Dolphins go brrrr
[8:38:26] <Meltgar> Dolphins are a nightmare
[8:38:26] <+Weeewer> damn you are good at charge motions
[8:38:28] <mothdude> hmm. Don't Like That.
[8:38:28] <%kewlmyc> I didn't even know she could do it that fast.
[8:38:30] <AhmCha> so how's the dub?
[8:38:30] <%X2Eliah> NO TRUCE WITH THE FURRIES (or fishies)
[8:38:38] <Saltmeisterr> Haha funny dolphin skip neutral
[8:38:39] <%Wool> Years of Blanka experience
[8:38:41] <jubejube56> Gooo
[8:38:41] <FirewallStorm> if he had eye frames with that dash though it'd be pretty sexy and busted
[8:38:43] <+Weeewer> well you are a blanka lol
[8:38:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[8:38:45] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it is lol
[8:38:46] <%zenith0111> TOTSUGEKI
[8:38:48] <NotHereToStream> may truly are the blanka players of GG
[8:38:51] <pi_in_the_sci> they should change the voice clip for that move
[8:38:57] <Zombrocom> DOLPHINS WHY
[8:38:57] <+OrangeMDT> @chilldima yeah, a slow, heavy hitting big samurai can work. But give him a better jump, or a dash with I-frames or armor, or something
[8:39:03] <+hibiki847> god ill need to learn someday how to be good at multiple dolphins
[8:39:08] <tsuchi7> do we know if dolphin is + or - on block?
[8:39:11] <+Weeewer> Horizontal = -1 i believe
[8:39:13] <+Celarious> that is a tight timing to catch that
[8:39:17] <+Weeewer> Verital is +1! dont even try
[8:39:17] <+saltpiggu> might also be able to grab her?
[8:39:27] <Zombrocom> One of the versions of dolphin is +
[8:39:32] <NotHereToStream> wait, training mode doesn't have the colour advantage disadvantage mode?
[8:39:38] <+Weeewer> yeah vertical dolphin is +1
[8:39:54] <Zombrocom> S horizontal is - H horizontal is +
[8:39:59] <%X2Eliah> Are the horz/vert dolphins always in sequence or can May mix them up?
[8:40:14] <+Weeewer> vert is barely - though, it resets
[8:40:33] <+Weeewer> @X2Eliah mix up, but its not as fluid
[8:40:35] <+saltpiggu> also 2S seems really good. Think it might have been buffed
[8:40:37] <+Celarious> wait do the nago timbs just beat it outright?
[8:41:20] <NotHereToStream> server plz

[8:45:53] <%zenith0111> Reset App
[8:45:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[8:45:58] <+NopeBadguy> May have to go into those god awful lobbies to find a match
[8:46:04] <Iza_kku> game bug maybe
[8:46:11] <jvilly96> I need to listen to that song again lol 😂
[8:46:13] <Ragnorok64> Minh isn't remote editing again is he?
[8:46:13] <maznuts> have you turn it on and off your PS5 @WoolieVersus
[8:46:16] <+JustToWatch> I'm not finding anyone either
[8:46:20] <+邪悪な死> macaw1 macawFPS macawFPS
[8:46:28] <Dragon_Batman> There were times I were kicked out of training after a pairing with someone
[8:46:32] <+M08Xrd> restart the game maybe?
[8:46:38] <Dragon_Batman> Seems like a weird hitch
[8:46:41] <jubejube56> This seems weird
[8:46:47] <+saltpiggu> 6P
[8:46:49] <+Weeewer> thats +1
[8:46:53] <+skylerpilot> she can air dash after it
[8:46:58] <EnderGamma> she can jump cancel it too
[8:47:03] <ergheisu> first time watching the new beta, what's the verdict on the lobby
[8:47:07] <+Weeewer> May can mash 5p in air and catch you if yorue trying to challenge
[8:47:11] <%notsoy> can she press a button falling from up-dolphin?
[8:47:18] <%X2Eliah> Man opponents just dropping in the background
[8:47:22] <+skylerpilot> @ergheisu its just as garbage as before
[8:47:32] <ergheisu> perfect
[8:47:43] <%Josef_Stryker> Is Woolie just gonna keep going until he's spent?
[8:47:43] <+Weeewer> as a may player i am also learning things here lol
[8:47:49] <Dragon_Batman> lol
[8:47:52] <+Weeewer> A lot of stuff loses to the 2H
[8:47:59] <+saltpiggu> 6p probably
[8:48:03] <+sundayafternoon1> how do you set the opponent in trainig mode to who ever you just fought?
[8:48:14] <+Weeewer> i think it beats most 6p
[8:49:23] <tsuchi7> is that S string unsafe?
[8:49:50] <+hibiki847> she also has arisugawa sparkle which if i recall even if you hit her still goes through
[8:49:51] <Iza_kku> might be a bug or something wacky
[8:50:09] <+KNUCKLEMAKO> you can cancel into his tatsu tho or fireball which Im pretty sure are 0 or plus on block
[8:50:10] <%dreadedcthulhu> the coolest guy
[8:50:33] <%CalderGaming> RAMBUTAN
[8:50:42] <+M08Xrd> THE COOLEST
[8:50:46] <%tyler274> tyler274 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Woolie let's fucking Gooooooo. I had the hypest match up with a friend tonight in the beta Sol v Ky and I dragon installed as Ky and shot a projective at Sol as he Heavy Mob cemeretaried through it and killed me
[8:50:51] <%X2Eliah> wtf
[8:50:54] <%X2Eliah> WOOLIE
[8:51:24] <bootysteve> is chipp just saying sushi over and over again
[8:51:25] <Picia000123> jesus
[8:51:29] <maznuts> damn this chipp is going ham
[8:51:29] <AhmCha> oh god, if I play in dub, gonna have to listen to "SUSHI, TSUKIYAKI" too often
[8:51:34] <juxtest> Perfect denied
[8:51:37] <%Wool> What an Amazing_Guy
[8:51:38] <DaRoosta89> Chipp's rekka is plus?
[8:51:43] <%CalderGaming> chat the thing you need to know about chipp
[8:51:45] <+saltpiggu> win
[8:51:45] <bootysteve> Just yelling japanese food words
[8:51:52] <%CalderGaming> he will say those things in english in the JP dub too
[8:52:02] <Picia000123> @bootysteve he is a massive weeb, he constantly just says japanese words cause he thinks they are cool
[8:52:06] <DaRoosta89> or is it just a stagger?
[8:52:18] <bootysteve> @Picia000123 that's great
[8:52:25] <+Sadnehs> wait this came out
[8:52:29] <%kewlmyc> You threw that
[8:52:30] <%CalderGaming> open beta 2
[8:52:36] <+saltpiggu> should reversal supered in bloodrage
[8:52:37] <%X2Eliah> ..... why
[8:52:37] <juxtest> Beta Jr: Return of the Beta
[8:52:39] <+Weeewer> no idea lol
[8:52:39] <bootysteve> NIPPON ICHI. DATTEBAYO.
[8:52:39] <Afrosamasenpai> Die
[8:52:44] <%Wool> oof
[8:52:46] <Picia000123> PERISH I guess
[8:52:46] <jubejube56> Hmm
[8:52:47] <%Sparkseid> die
[8:52:52] <%kewlmyc> BibleThump
[8:52:55] <%Sparkseid> jab no work
[8:52:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[8:53:01] <CupsCommander> Chipp n' Dipp
[8:53:06] <TricksterGod3> Is it me, or is Chipp doing way more damage than he did in the last beta/
[8:53:09] <+M08Xrd> Believe it
[8:53:09] <TricksterGod3> *?
[8:53:14] <DudeDern> They put sonic in guilty gear
[8:53:14] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> woolie faded to black
[8:53:15] <%Wool> Chipp is insane
[8:53:23] <bootysteve> Fade to blackface
[8:53:24] <%Wool> looks like a bad MU for Nago
[8:53:30] <AhmCha> does chipp still have a hitbox on gamma blade?
[8:53:38] <AhmCha> hurtbox i meant
[8:53:41] <jubejube56> My guess is that Nago will have some crazy otk combo on chip in the main game....if he can stop the rushdown
[8:53:42] <Dragon_Batman> Chipp and Milia are a rough time with Nago, in my experience at least
[8:53:52] <+Sadnehs> damn this game looks good
[8:54:05] <DaRoosta89> faultless doesnt help with getting some space?
[8:54:20] <+saltpiggu> hold low till he jumps and anti air
[8:54:29] <%Brightstreak> !uptime

[8:55:11] <Nikbottom> yer stylin man
[8:55:12] <+Weeewer> i appreciate the stream woolz
[8:55:23] <bootysteve> Castle Superbeast Episode 120: Addicted to CBT 2
[8:55:25] <+M08Xrd> Gio's dub is pretty good
[8:55:32] <Nikbottom> Gio's sleepy
[8:55:34] <AhmCha> oh Gio's dub is a good fit
[8:55:39] <zamzoph> Gio's dub is pretty bad
[8:55:49] <+MAGNUMB> Gio's dub is pretty good
[8:55:54] <Dragon_Batman> Personally I like Gio Eng more than Jp
[8:55:59] <+RealPT1> can't help it I'm sleepy is a good option select
[8:56:01] <ManaSpurt> Gio's dub is pretty good
[8:56:03] <%Brightstreak> learning a lot from these streams. thanks captain
[8:56:04] <bootysteve> Holy shit where did all his health go
[8:56:07] <+cubbywolf> late night woolie? nice
[8:56:11] <Zombrocom> ENG Gio sounds weird, but so does J Gio so it makes sense
[8:56:13] <%X2Eliah> @bootysteve rage
[8:56:23] <DustTroopa1000> Hi Woolie!!! It's my first time catching one of your streams. I Hope your having a good night.
[8:56:31] <bootysteve> Nago seems super high risk high reward
[8:56:32] <reddpop_> Just tuning in, Woolie seems to have really leveled up since his matches with Pat. Love to see it
[8:56:52] <%zenith0111> You can get Positive Meter off of a Dust
[8:56:53] <+saltpiggu> does anyone know nagos dust string?
[8:56:55] <Dragon_Batman> Oh there was a bug Max was hitting when you get a rank up or down. He had to restart the game if that happened
[8:57:01] <%Akizea> @Zombrocom honestly i like english gio more
[8:57:07] <zerointelligence000> The dub oddly sounds like it has more emotion in the grunts... I'm conflicted
[8:57:17] <bootysteve> we love the tired kickgirl
[8:57:35] <ManaSpurt> Gio's japanese voice sounds too nasally to me
[8:57:40] <TheFoxlyfe> Is the audio a little distorted for anyone else?
[8:57:45] <ManaSpurt> No
[8:57:48] <+CherteuseKapibara> no
[8:57:53] <+M08Xrd> "Seriously stop" lmao
[8:57:55] <%Blue_Que> Blue_Que subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[8:58:04] <Dragon_Batman> @TheFoxlyfe  Your video is trying to catch up which is why it sounds like that
[8:58:08] <%X2Eliah> @TheFoxlyfe reload your twitchpage
[8:58:12] <DoctorArby> Seriously Stop as a burst quote from Gio is great
[8:58:15] <Dragon_Batman> Try pausing and playing
[8:58:20] <TheFoxlyfe> Reload fixed it, thanks <3
[8:58:28] <Dragon_Batman> Eey nice
[8:58:40] <+M08Xrd> She's sleepy
[8:58:55] <%X2Eliah> So what I'm seeing is, Gio is not as muhc of a threat
[8:59:06] <%CalderGaming> this one isn't, maybe
[8:59:17] <Dragon_Batman> She can be nasty tho
[8:59:21] <ManaSpurt> You can't go by one person playing gio
[8:59:32] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's more she doesn't have dirty stuff like the others
[8:59:38] <NotHereToStream> not much of  a point to block dust burst, you may aswell capitalize on dmg
[8:59:50] <CupsCommander> This gio doesn't seem to be mixing as much as others
[8:59:50] <TheFoxlyfe> I can't wait to literally only play Nago when this comes out, such a cool design
[9:00:30] <Zombrocom> "Can we not?" Is also a fantastic burst quote
[9:00:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[9:00:37] <+saltpiggu> woolie hates using meter
[9:00:37] <+Nocturne_Noble> It's nice that HS gets longer stronger as the Blood Guage increases.
[9:00:37] <floralkami> man, I'm glad I'm feeling both new characters
[9:00:38] <aka_Jigawatt> almost popped
[9:01:01] <zerointelligence000> the blood gauge doesn't seem as fast as before
[9:01:10] <+Superbro64> EYY. Late night strive with Woolie!
[9:01:13] <+Superbro64> Nice
[9:01:24] <+Superbro64> We in those max hours now
[9:01:28] <aka_Jigawatt> just the tip
[9:01:47] <Dragon_Batman> Dam that's a tip and a half
[9:01:55] <floralkami> @zerointelligence000 it's not. I think they balanced it to make it more for combo decision making instead of risk for getting in
[9:02:28] <+Superbro64> Ps can be cancelled into specials, correct?
[9:02:33] <theredfox930000> woolie madden given the people just the tip
[9:02:37] <+Superbro64> Ps just cant be gattled in strive
[9:02:42] <floralkami> I think it gets faster with each successive special, tho
[9:03:43] <Zombrocom> P gatlings into P
[9:03:46] <Zombrocom> Bout it
[9:04:17] <Zombrocom> I think P 6P special works for most characters
[9:04:43] <+TheAlbinoBaskerville> how is Nago so far?
[9:04:43] <floralkami> you know what, I think I know why I'll like this game. EVERYONE now plays like Slayer but easier
[9:05:11] <%X2Eliah> @TheAlbinoBaskerville big husbando
[9:05:14] <Zombrocom> Slayer laughes at the lack of gatlings in this game. He just yells "Welcome to my world!:
[9:05:49] <floralkami> that's it. that's the lore. Slayer literally took everyone to the 5th Dimension
[9:06:08] <Zombrocom> Spiral arrow is plus
[9:06:35] <+sundayafternoon1> its slow but its plus indeed
[9:07:05] <%Brightstreak> chat, when does the beta end?
[9:07:07] <+saltpiggu> bought to pop
[9:07:17] <+M08Xrd> She just wants to go home man
[9:07:19] <Zombrocom> Beta ends tomorrow morning I think?
[9:07:27] <+LandOfTheWay> holy shit woolz is still going?
[9:07:29] <+TheAlbinoBaskerville> I wish Slayer was in this game, He most likely won't even make it as DLC I feel
[9:07:31] <Dragon_Batman> In the morning? dang
[9:07:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[9:07:32] <%Sparkseid> back to 10
[9:07:43] <maznuts> !MOTIVATED
[9:07:43] <@Moobot> 2223 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[9:07:44] <%Brightstreak> thank you
[9:07:44] <+M08Xrd> Back in heaven
[9:07:46] <+FuqBoiSlim> Woolie will make it back to heaven by any means
[9:07:46] <rReizs> COME FORTH LIL BUSSEY MAN
[9:07:58] <zamzoph> h-he's fast monkaS
[9:08:21] <%Sparkseid> nah
[9:08:25] <TheVoltStrike> no it cranks up a bit more
[9:08:33] <TheVoltStrike> oh?
[9:08:37] <+PianoAlone> PogChamp
[9:08:41] <Dragon_Batman> Neat
[9:09:21] <%Sparkseid> indeed
[9:09:22] <+LandOfTheWay> good name
[9:09:25] <+M08Xrd> Great name
[9:09:33] <+FuqBoiSlim> based arenabro
[9:09:36] <NotHereToStream> based
[9:09:40] <floralkami> is that Moopoke?
[9:09:55] <floralkami> sounds like something Moopoke would do
[9:10:01] <Zombrocom> Moopoke wouldn't play KY
[9:10:02] <Dragon_Batman> Weird
[9:10:04] <+NarcissistCactus> he has to put the mask on
[9:10:08] <Picia000123> it has to hit
[9:10:10] <%Sparkseid> hm?
[9:10:11] <NotHereToStream> moopoke is a leo player
[9:10:20] <Picia000123> maybe
[9:10:42] <+LandOfTheWay> he was playing ky in that color yesterday
[9:10:51] <+LandOfTheWay> but that ain't the name he was playing under
[9:10:54] <floralkami> @notheretostream Moo was playing Ky yesterday, tho
[9:11:02] <NotHereToStream> bruh
[9:11:13] <LordOfThePoultry> nago kinda oppresive
[9:11:28] <TheVoltStrike> WOW bloodsucking universe cranks down the entire bar, didn't notice
[9:11:30] <+saltpiggu> swat
[9:11:30] <+M08Xrd> DAMN
[9:11:36] <Dragon_Batman> Noice
[9:11:46] <floralkami> lol
[9:12:11] <floralkami> and now it's down
[9:12:30] <Dragon_Batman> Aw bummer
[9:12:32] <%Sparkseid> rip
[9:12:34] <+FuqBoiSlim> FeelsBadMan
[9:12:43] <Zombrocom> Nago kinda oppressive but if he oppresses you too long he just kills himself so...
[9:13:00] <+saltpiggu> oogie boogie
[9:13:09] <Dragon_Batman> I mean part of that oppression is hopefully getting a grab in
[9:13:22] <%zenith0111> @zombrocom Kinda like Sin
[9:13:31] <striderzer0> the blood pop doesnt do damage right? like it cant kill someone with 1 HP
[9:13:44] <Zombrocom> That flip kick is plus if your crouching or shocked
[9:13:49] <Dragon_Batman> Nah as far as I know it doesn't do damage
[9:13:56] <%Sparkseid> @striderzer0 no
[9:14:06] <%Sparkseid> ive tried
[9:14:09] <CupsCommander> No, the pop is basically a burst
[9:14:24] <%barkon345> damn I cant believe Woolie is still streaming
[9:14:31] <CupsCommander> I think it may guard break though?
[9:14:31] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[9:14:35] <nahmercy> damn 9 hours?
[9:14:46] <%Sparkseid> @cupscommander yes
[9:15:05] <+TheotherKristian> He must play
[9:15:18] <floralkami> I really like Ky's yellow color in this, and I usually hate the yellow options in most games. something about that flat mustard shade
[9:15:32] <floralkami> with the new lightning
[9:15:42] <+saltpiggu> nice
[9:15:46] <Dragon_Batman> @floralkami  I know what you mean, I feel the same about most yellows
[9:16:00] <%dreadedcthulhu> that backdash was clean
[9:16:02] <+LandOfTheWay> most of the color palettes look real nice, tho i wish we had a few more just for variety
[9:16:03] <Dragon_Batman> Then I see I-no's or Ky and I'm like niiiice
[9:16:12] <velgaduere> @floralkami inoffensive because it's not a bright floral mess, I feel ya. closer to gold
[9:16:24] <CupsCommander> I-no, Miliia, and Ram have good yellow colors
[9:16:36] <velgaduere> Ram's yellow is very good, it's true
[9:16:45] <Dragon_Batman> Ye ye
[9:16:50] <nahmercy> everytime
[9:16:53] <+saltpiggu> rough end there
[9:17:00] <floralkami> I think it's also something you could wear something similar in real life, sans the glove and deep ass cleavage
[9:17:38] <+saltpiggu> nothing stopping you from wearing gloves and deep ass cleavage
[9:17:49] <floralkami> honestly, a lot of these new designs are just cool real outfits
[9:17:56] <floralkami> with a little anime flare
[9:18:03] <floralkami> as a treat
[9:18:11] <+M08Xrd> Oh no
[9:18:16] <Onamar> Axl's dub kills me
[9:18:28] <+M08Xrd> Wild Axl appears
[9:18:36] <floralkami> like May's is the most normal by far, but you forgot it cause of that big ass anchor
[9:18:53] <Dragon_Batman> True
[9:19:31] <floralkami> and I've seen people wear what Axl is wearing irl. yk what, I'm making some of these when possible.
[9:20:55] <%zenith0111> NICE
[9:20:59] <velgaduere> sick
[9:21:02] <%Sparkseid> NICE
[9:21:33] <%zenith0111> Everyones inner demons. Zoning
[9:21:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[9:21:37] <floralkami> ... wait, I *have* worn something like that, minus the jacket...
[9:22:27] <juxtest> Got him
[9:22:47] <+saltpiggu> the vortex
[9:22:55] <floralkami> they gotta add more of these jackets in the Arc store soon
[9:23:16] <%zenith0111> @woolieversus He was two different timing on the spin. The longer one has a extra vaccum effect
[9:23:23] <%X2Eliah> rip
[9:23:28] <+NotMrDiddles> owie zowie
[9:23:52] <%zenith0111> Block and punish works
[9:24:06] <%zenith0111> Its risky for Axl
[9:24:20] <+cb27bx> good shit broooo nice one
[9:24:22] <T_major> Is there any benefit to getting a maxed out blood gauge (or whatever it';s called) on Nago? Seems really steep punishment
[9:24:40] <%X2Eliah> @T_major It seems like a straight up punishment
[9:24:42] <metalwater8> How is the beta chat?
[9:24:53] <%X2Eliah> @metalwater8 looks amazing
[9:24:56] <TrashLeviathan> beta fun
[9:25:01] <CarelessWhimper> Hearing Octo is so wild
[9:25:05] <CarelessWhimper> Good times
[9:25:07] <floralkami> @t_major it's not, it's more like something to plan a backup around
[9:25:27] <%zenith0111> Super is his only Reversal so 50% meter Axl will let it rip

[9:25:58] <connerhozer> What’s been the hardest matchup so far?
[9:26:00] <monkeyp0wer> This is my first time seeing any guilty gear gameplay. Nagoriyuki looks cool.
[9:26:07] <floralkami> @t_major you can let yourself go during block pressure and earn the pop as a pseudo-gold burst to keep them in
[9:26:27] <%zenith0111> @woolieversus When you crouch you lessen the vacuum effect so it could throw you off
[9:26:38] <T_major> I see I see 🤔
[9:27:02] <%X2Eliah> rematch
[9:27:15] <$ArCielArDor> You've been doing this for how many hours without a break?
[9:27:18] <%zenith0111> Ye jusr Block it and punish
[9:27:30] <+sundayafternoon1> I think he should really have a better grab tool like ABA did in order to get the blood gauge down
[9:27:37] <+Malchiah_Tenabre> Holy shit your still going?
[9:27:43] <floralkami> some characters also have some funny animations when they get raged on, like Anji cowers in fear
[9:28:02] <CupsCommander> We're all invested in the woolie training arc
[9:28:10] <$KinggOfCarbs> Nago theme is such a banger
[9:28:14] <floralkami> @sundayafternoon1 he does, that grab instantly drains the BG
[9:28:18] <%kinetikpaws> almost
[9:28:21] <%Josef_Stryker> It's probably my fave song in the OST
[9:28:27] <$KinggOfCarbs> its def my favorite
[9:28:38] <%kinetikpaws> i just got here oh. . .9 hours nice session
[9:28:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[9:28:39] <monkeyp0wer> Society is pretty good.
[9:29:01] <floralkami> ABA had more range, but it was used to get in and out of her state.
[9:29:06] <$KinggOfCarbs> does Ky have a DI theme
[9:29:25] <floralkami> and had to be good as a combo ender
[9:29:38] <CupsCommander> Nago's theme is also my favorite so far, though I'm looking forward to Ram's and Zato's/ Milia's as well
[9:30:00] <+M08Xrd> @kinggofcarbs i don't think so at least not yet
[9:30:21] <floralkami> this grab has to have some risk involved to get in, otherwise it would be way too easy to clean the BG after a nice combo
[9:30:55] <+R0kushi> too avoidable though
[9:30:57] <+M08Xrd> Gio's and Chipp's themes are great too
[9:30:58] <%kinetikpaws> good stuff
[9:31:10] <floralkami> he should have an air grab mixup, tho
[9:31:12] <%deejay782> he couldve gotten out of that?
[9:31:18] <$KinggOfCarbs> I wish they would just give nago a bad dash or something, being almost full blood and not being able to really move is annoying af
[9:31:21] <CupsCommander> I think it's balanced out by how hard it is for Nago to get in in the first place
[9:31:28] <+Vijuani> ayyy nice
[9:31:30] <+M08Xrd> Strive's OST is pretty nice so far
[9:31:36] <%dreadedcthulhu> found the mix
[9:31:42] <+lord_vanilli> People have to mash on Nago. Slash slash auto combo reset is super fake on block
[9:31:42] <grimshuck> Hi Woolie!
[9:32:26] <floralkami> if he had an air grab that cleaned his gauge, it would give the opponent something to think about when Nago is almost full
[9:32:27] <+lord_vanilli> Same with his clone dash stuff it’s all minus
[9:33:16] <Picia000123> My man needs to use more specials, he does almost nothing but normals
[9:33:22] <floralkami> last I heard, the clone is plus on block, minus on whiff
[9:33:32] <TrashLeviathan> does nago have any good mix ups?
[9:33:41] <%kinetikpaws> you have to work so hard
[9:33:42] <connerhozer> Sometimes I just hear the lyrics to “Come Together” during this song
[9:33:51] <+lord_vanilli> Clone canceled into dash is always minus unless they changed it this patch I didn’t lab it
[9:34:01] <+lord_vanilli> But I see people mash out of it all the time
[9:34:05] <BUDderzIllA> It's so what, Woolie? Kappa
[9:34:11] <mimikyou67> damn Axl
[9:34:15] <floralkami> good, he's Slayer's protege.
[9:34:17] <+NarcissistCactus> samurai shodown looks kinda different
[9:34:22] <fakespecialist> thats what you get for playing low tier woolier
[9:34:26] <Overhaul180> @TrashLeviathan There's one baked into 5SS (stopping at 2 hits of the 3-hit combo), he also can do teleport after certain knockdowns and be plus
[9:34:33] <fakespecialist> shoulda picked top tier like ram/sol/may
[9:34:41] <+M08Xrd> The Nago grind is real
[9:34:43] <+R0kushi> lol
[9:34:48] <+drewdrew89> this is quite the matchup
[9:34:54] <$KinggOfCarbs> god I hate the dolphins
[9:34:56] <+lord_vanilli> 2 hits of slash auto combo into a mixup is super fake it’s punishable on block
[9:34:57] <Jaysky> Totsugekiiii
[9:35:14] <$KinggOfCarbs> Nago is a struggle
[9:35:21] <NotHereToStream> got to dive in deep like cold steel
[9:35:22] <Picia000123> not having double jump really sucks for Nago against Axl
[9:35:22] <Overhaul180> It's fake but you can condition with it
[9:35:28] <Jaysky> Lack of anything to go in
[9:35:36] <+R0kushi> blood gauge needs some better balance
[9:35:37] <$KinggOfCarbs> Woolie this is 2 guilty gears in a row, why do you do this to yourself
[9:35:38] <%deejay782> english voices arent that bad tbh
[9:35:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[9:35:44] <Overhaul180> Like 5SS 214K and throw out 5S again; saw Fame using it to punish people pressing after
[9:35:52] <%zenith0111> Definitely not a good mu for Axl
[9:35:54] <CupsCommander> You did get to visit heaven though
[9:35:55] <$ArCielArDor> Dude take a break for a minute. flex your fingers
[9:35:56] <DudeDern> What does Nago’s air game look like? Does he have an air dash?
[9:35:59] <%LordSDB> NO ESCAPE!
[9:35:59] <+M08Xrd> Oh nooo NotLikeThis
[9:36:03] <%X2Eliah> Same guy again
[9:36:03] <fakespecialist> NO ESCAPE
[9:36:06] <%kinetikpaws> oof
[9:36:07] <%X2Eliah> 3rd time
[9:36:09] <%zenith0111> I mean Nago lol
[9:36:10] <velgaduere> CAN'T ESCAPE FROM CROSSING SICKLES
[9:36:15] <+lord_vanilli> Nago is way too cool to be this weird and probably not good
[9:36:16] <floralkami> Axl has disjointed hitboxes on his sythes, right?
[9:36:29] <TrashLeviathan> i think so ?
[9:36:30] <floralkami> @dudedern no dashes
[9:36:36] <vaneneuro> Is it true Nago's normals get better as blood gauge fills even before it pops?
[9:36:39] <DudeDern> That blows
[9:36:40] <+HorseWitNoName> No breaks, only strive
[9:36:43] <%zenith0111> I think you close will grow throw his chains if I remember
[9:36:48] <%Shadow_Yomi> Shadow_Yomi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! let's go!!!
[9:36:50] <floralkami> @dudedern it's part of his gameplay
[9:36:52] <+lord_vanilli> If they made him pretty much normal I would 30000% main him only
[9:37:05] <%zenith0111> stupid auto correct
[9:37:24] <Jaysky> Nice
[9:37:27] <%kinetikpaws> niiiice patience
[9:37:29] <%X2Eliah> whew
[9:37:30] <CarelessWhimper> NICE
[9:37:32] <luckysteak> It sucks that it takes 10 seconds to approach and one 3 hit combo to be hit to the other side for another round
[9:37:32] <%X2Eliah> That was good
[9:37:37] <+Ben_Ben817> Hooooo that looked stressful
[9:37:41] <floralkami> @dudedern remember, he has HUGE screen filling sword normals
[9:37:44] <TrashLeviathan> i think this match up is all about patience
[9:37:55] <%X2Eliah> Oh yeah that whirlwind is super risky for axl
[9:38:02] <%X2Eliah> because it brings opponent right in
[9:38:02] <Zombrocom> Nago feels like a boss character they crippled for the playable version.
[9:38:10] <+lord_vanilli> This character ain’t good bro @floralkami
[9:38:16] <Zombrocom> Imagine him with normal mobility and no blood gauge
[9:38:31] <NotHereToStream> full screen command grab is always scary
[9:38:35] <Jaysky> I like that clothesline Axl adds
[9:38:36] <%CzeekyTV> goddamn almost 10 hours, woolie really is a GG king
[9:38:40] <DudeDern> Nago’s game is its own beast. It’s cool but hard to wrap my head around
[9:39:08] <floralkami> @lord_vanilli you saying that as if Woolie didn't take him to heaven. just cause he ain't what you want doesn't mean he ain't good to learn
[9:39:19] <+lord_vanilli> Woolie is a good player
[9:39:24] <Iza_kku> your body and sword hit box is so long, i see why they make nago slow
[9:39:26] <floralkami> exactly
[9:39:28] <TrashLeviathan> does anyone actually like the aerial backdash nerf
[9:39:29] <floralkami> get good
[9:39:34] <CupsCommander> He's definitely a lot harder to play this beta, I used Nago for a few matches today but then went back to my main
[9:39:39] <+lord_vanilli> That’s seeparate from character strength lol
[9:39:41] <Zombrocom> Conversely, just because woolie got him to heaven doesn't make nago good
[9:39:43] <Jaysky> Well shit
[9:39:45] <+dustiler> off the spacing
[9:39:46] <%X2Eliah> lol
[9:39:51] <%CzeekyTV> damn, good try
[9:39:59] <+lord_vanilli> I didn’t say he’s unplayable, but unless they change him later he’s not going to age well
[9:39:59] <mimikyou67> f
[9:40:01] <Overhaul180> Wonder if 214H RC gets under all of the antiairs
[9:40:07] <floralkami> @zombrocom I didn't say he was good, I'm saying he's not bad
[9:40:18] <+kaiber132> @WoolieVersus  Is that an Australian Accent I detect on Axllow  ?
[9:40:27] <%X2Eliah> So who is a bad character to main?
[9:40:30] <+lord_vanilli> People keep getting hit by fake mixups. I didn’t say it’s free or easy but the meta will progress  @floralkami
[9:40:31] <Picia000123> This matchup looks like hell LUL
[9:40:38] <DudeDern> Jump rope with Axl featuring WoolieVersus
[9:40:47] <Dragon_Batman> I think most matchups with Axl is super frustrating
[9:40:50] <$KinggOfCarbs> can't woolie 2S the landing recovery of those jump attacks
[9:40:51] <Zombrocom> Nago vs Axl feels like Slayer vs Axl used too
[9:40:56] <Zombrocom> Shit is hard
[9:41:04] <floralkami> @lord_vanilli yeah, some characters are like that. I play Slayer. fake mixups is pretty much the gameplay.
[9:41:09] <+M08Xrd> Lmao
[9:41:16] <monki_the_goblin> Ayy first time I get to watch Wooli
[9:41:16] <$KinggOfCarbs> SCOOP
[9:41:21] <Overhaul180> Bonk
[9:41:21] <luckysteak> rekt
[9:41:23] <Picia000123> there you go
[9:41:23] <vaneneuro> Nago's theme but instead of Sayonara it's axl's kusarigama
[9:41:24] <Iza_kku> yo
[9:41:25] <+M08Xrd> Nice
[9:41:26] <%kinetikpaws> woolieYE woolieYE
[9:41:31] <redapache> predict the Axl movement
[9:41:31] <NotHereToStream> once you're in, you got to keep being in
[9:41:32] <Jaysky> Stop. Get some help.
[9:41:33] <TrashLeviathan> i feel like nago and gio are kinda under-developed
[9:41:47] <%zenith0111> Show him you aint free!
[9:41:48] <$KinggOfCarbs> Gio's kit feels unfinished
[9:41:54] <+dustiler> Getting in
[9:41:55] <Iza_kku> I'm a sucker for swordsmen, so i dig this vampire
[9:42:01] <monki_the_goblin> Nago's cool!
[9:42:03] <+dustiler> downloaded?
[9:42:04] <floralkami> a lot of characters feel underdeveloped, tbf
[9:42:18] <Iza_kku> it's almost like it's abeta
[9:42:20] <floralkami> aside from Sol.
[9:42:28] <floralkami> and Ky
[9:42:29] <$KinggOfCarbs> and I-no
[9:42:34] <Overhaul180> 214HS recovers so fast jesus
[9:42:35] <TrashLeviathan> imo gio shoulda been like ken&koro from p4U2
[9:42:37] <+lord_vanilli> Slayer isn’t fake he’s commital. The shit nago players approach with is just fake. Clone->dash is punishable straight up. 5SS is punishable. You can’t actually close distant half decently @floralkami
[9:42:41] <%X2Eliah> nice
[9:42:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[9:42:41] <NotHereToStream> nice
[9:42:43] <+lord_vanilli> I mean you understand this lol
[9:42:44] <Jaysky> I-No isn't under developed. Have you seen those tiddies?
[9:42:48] <%kinetikpaws> yooo
[9:42:55] <Iza_kku> BE the sword
[9:43:01] <%zenith0111> LETS GOO
[9:43:10] <RocketBarrel> Gettin better with Nago I see. Good on ya Woolz
[9:43:15] <+lord_vanilli> You can always outplay your opponent
[9:43:16] <+M08Xrd> Be one with the blade
[9:43:34] <NotHereToStream> oppressing somebody in a match can do big mental damage
[9:43:45] <NotHereToStream> conditioning is a bitch
[9:43:50] <floralkami> @lord_vanilli dude, you keep mentioning this one combo as if it's a be all, end all
[9:44:02] <Saltmeisterr> any leos yet chat?
[9:44:04] <TrashLeviathan> big psychic damage will win you the round
[9:44:07] <Iza_kku> is this character big gougi energy? or wait yomi mind reads
[9:44:39] <NotHereToStream> uh can't you stop his back command dash early and go for a f.S
[9:44:42] <Jaysky> A Faust?
[9:44:44] <%X2Eliah> Wool!
[9:44:46] <%Wool> milking the beta as much as I can
[9:44:51] <%Wool> lmao you gotta earn it
[9:44:51] <floralkami> @lord_vanilli and idk if you're looking at the same moves in looking at, but the recovery on them looks a lot more committal than Slayer has even been
[9:44:53] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[9:44:57] <TrashLeviathan> LUL
[9:45:00] <%X2Eliah> GO WOOL
[9:45:04] <%X2Eliah> BEAT HIS ASS
[9:45:06] <BigNerdSam> Woolie banned for win-trading
[9:45:13] <DudeDern> Yeah faust time
[9:45:13] <Overhaul180> Oh man eff this matchup
[9:45:14] <+lord_vanilli> Those are his 2 main approaches you see online, dude ~ @floralkami . I’m just saying this Nago isn’t going to age well. I’m not making any other point. Have fun with zato, milia, ino, sol, ram or like any fast character with pressure
[9:45:21] <TrashLeviathan> who is Fausts VA?
[9:45:28] <Saltmeisterr> Kaiji Tang
[9:45:31] <Saltmeisterr> aka ichiban
[9:45:35] <Jaysky> Ichiban has fallen on hard times
[9:45:39] <%X2Eliah> @lord_vanilli You cannot expect every character to be a fast pressure char
[9:45:40] <lonosis47> Woolie lost
[9:45:43] <MethodiaLordae> <3
[9:45:49] <+lord_vanilli> Dog I’m not lol
[9:45:55] <Iza_kku> i feel like the biggest thing with nago is making them come to you due to being a little slow
[9:46:03] <Iza_kku> but that's not exactly gonna be viable
[9:46:03] <+lord_vanilli> I’m saying spamming jump and aerials ain’t gonna carry him in this game
[9:46:05] <Jaysky> Vore
[9:46:10] <floralkami> @lord_vanilli I will, it's not like it'll be much different than what I'm already used to. this character was always give be the character that needed time
[9:46:13] <+xiccy> Holy shit. He's still going!

[9:47:08] <vaneneuro> Is there nothing safe-ish Nago can do after flash-step on approach?
[9:47:09] <lonosis47> Has woolie been blaming his character a lot?
[9:47:10] <+M08Xrd> Woo[lie] lmao LUL
[9:47:13] <+Superbro64> nice
[9:47:20] <Iza_kku> nah lono
[9:47:37] <Iza_kku> i only got here after reggie left, but i think woolie is doing well with the moveset
[9:47:37] <+Superbro64> that time stop to get the air grab was sick
[9:47:41] <RocketBarrel> @vaneneuro he can mash P i think
[9:47:53] <lonosis47> I didnt ask you lmao
[9:48:12] <Iza_kku> you asked a question bro

[9:48:53] <%X2Eliah> @lonosis47 not at all, no
[9:48:53] <Dragon_Batman> Then throw a Kappa or something lol
[9:49:01] <RocketBarrel> dont ask a question and then be an asshole when you get an answer
[9:49:02] <floralkami> has Woolie tried to slap the scalpel poke yet?
[9:49:08] <Iza_kku> @lonosis47 careful he might not have asked you either lmao

[9:49:43] <floralkami> @shadowanroid yes
[9:49:48] <+Superbro64> near unreactable
[9:49:51] <connerhozer> Is it hard to get in on this character or is the player really good?
[9:49:51] <+Shadowanroid> i thought it was just a visual thing for the longest time hahaha
[9:49:52] <+Superbro64> jeez
[9:49:56] <+M08Xrd> Faust looks so sick in this game
[9:49:56] <+skylerpilot> @Shadowanroid yeah and it makes your hurtbox bigger
[9:49:56] <Frogwash> @lonosis47 My guy you get what you bring in
[9:50:02] <NotHereToStream> oh shit, faust can croush the f.S
[9:50:04] <Iza_kku> for real
[9:50:14] <Dragon_Batman> @lonosis47  They just answered a question trying to be friendly and your just being like don't answer the question I asked
[9:50:14] <%Josef_Stryker> Man, this is the longest Woolie has ever gone streaming
[9:50:15] <CarelessWhimper> They got Corpse Husband for fausts voice? 🤔
[9:50:18] <%X2Eliah> Faust looks really fun to play
[9:50:33] <Jaysky> What if you wanted to go to heaven, but God said... "LIE DOWN"?
[9:50:38] <Iza_kku> yooo this game is dope
[9:50:39] <Saltmeisterr> i wish faust still had his head extend idle
[9:50:40] <lonosis47> And your literally trying to start shit so just shush already @Dragon_Batman
[9:50:48] <+Superbro64> jesus
[9:50:54] <grimshuck> jesus
[9:50:55] <Iza_kku> @lonosis47 can someone ban this guy already
[9:50:57] <+Superbro64> I can never guess when he does that
[9:50:59] <Dragon_Batman> Nice LUL
[9:51:00] <+Superbro64> good lord
[9:51:02] <floralkami> @shadowanroid it makes the vertical hurtbox bigger and taller which gives Faust longer combo Options
[9:51:14] <connerhozer> The finish with the eating feel disrespected lol
[9:51:31] <$KinggOfCarbs> Teleport fast rc is nasty
[9:51:34] <$KinggOfCarbs> im stealing that

[9:51:58] <Exeerdna> Faust buttons are so good
[9:51:58] <DudeDern> Is this matchup harder than axl?
[9:51:59] <+Superbro64> Fuast with 50 tension is a ss tier character, send tweet
[9:52:04] <%Wool> you just have to tech it

[9:53:03] <%Wool> 214S is the one you want to be as close as possible
[9:53:23] <+Superbro64> we need that tech that +r has with being able to act out of a replay
[9:53:24] <Iza_kku> @lonosis47 they just got here like 5 mins ago, asking if woolie blames his character. they trollin
