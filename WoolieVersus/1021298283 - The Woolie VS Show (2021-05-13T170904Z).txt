[0:03:07] <leith_aziz> Very excited for Strive beta! Hope my controller comes in time tommorow. dont wanna miss out on much
[0:03:24] <%nicversus> Awww yeah Radiant Silvergun
[0:03:36] <%emperordread> Hi guys, I'm behind on the anime but what's goin on in Disco Manga?
[0:03:43] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> It's time for another day of Woolie being called a coward by the game
[0:03:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:03:49] <%nicversus> I've been playing that a lot lately on my saturn, since I got one of those pseudo saturn kai carts and can play burned games.
[0:03:52] <+Reverend_Roscoe> YEYEYE
[0:03:53] <leith_aziz> @emperordread Universe reset
[0:03:59] <SolSwagGuy56> @emperordread Kim unlocked his Mangekyo Sharingan
[0:03:59] <leith_aziz> (joking)
[0:04:17] <MrPedrovsky> So will this be the 3rd looooong LP after DS2 and KoToR2???
[0:04:32] <$Nullseven> one can only hope
[0:04:43] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> This game's not all that long tbh unless he's gonna do a second run or something
[0:04:58] <%emperordread> Oh boy, the lore goes deep. Strapping in woolieYE
[0:04:58] <%nicversus> Everyone here should give Radiant Silvergun a shot if you can, even through emulation. It's a wild shmup experience.
[0:05:00] <derap41> from Dodger To Woolie
[0:05:05] <ProducerMatt42> Time for another episode of "Woolie and Reggie fuck around and find out"
[0:05:10] <SolSwagGuy56> Imagine it's another 4 hours of talking to Joyce
[0:05:20] <%nicversus> @derap41 the weirdest sequel to From Justin to Kelly
[0:05:22] <MrPedrovsky> @newandtastysixthhouse Not if he pulls a woolie and stops for 5 minutes after every sentence Kappa
[0:05:24] <%Juriasu> Most of Joyce is done thankfully
[0:05:28] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @SolSwagGuy56 God please no
[0:05:33] <SolSwagGuy56> Kappa
[0:05:37] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Dump Joyce in the fuckin sea and be done lol
[0:05:49] <derap41> @nicversus Pretty much having a 20 hours ED marathon
[0:05:51] <+fentry> Disco isnt an incredibly long game but considering his first day lasted like 16 hours I think its gonna take him a while
[0:06:20] <SolSwagGuy56> I want him to tackle the Union. It's actually amazing seeing how many streamers just never see Evrart
[0:06:25] <leith_aziz> Disco isnt a long game? that shocks me

[0:07:23] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Completely blowing out the racist guy is a must-do for every playthrough for me LUL
[0:07:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> Nah, Woolie didn't learn the forbidden knowledge from Measurehead
[0:07:44] <leith_aziz> Woolie will never tap into Ultra racism
[0:07:46] <%emperordread> @NewAndTastySixthHouse Which one though? There are so many
[0:07:51] <SolSwagGuy56> Yeah he didn't become racist. Yet....
[0:07:57] <MrPedrovsky> Anyone know if Tales of Arise in the same world as Berseria??

[0:09:21] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Woolie already found the power of "You're black"  LUL
[0:09:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> "subscribing" to Measureheads ideology opens up some funny dialogue options. Like telling the first racist how deep the race enigma truly goes lmao
[0:09:33] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[0:09:36] <servicesuspension> the only way to know if it's Woolie's birthday is to see if he's wearing the kigurumi

[0:23:10] <Indigo_Automaton> Weird noise coming through the mic?
[0:23:15] <%nicversus> @andre11dr it's probably a crackling fire in the game

[0:25:47] <derap41> Lindsay Ellies did and expo on that long of Knotting
[0:25:49] <Sadnehs> waiting for the Smash Bros Brawl fanfic to get adapted (longest written english language piece in history)
[0:25:58] <%Exiliator> woolieMIRIN
[0:26:01] <servicesuspension> @derap41 WHAT
[0:26:03] <mr_sups> Beat it Disco last night.
[0:26:05] <+Prevot> hopefully all of it
[0:26:06] <%nintega010> It's woolies birthday today?
[0:26:09] <MrPedrovsky> @derap41 That drunk from Channel Awesome?
[0:26:10] <DatAsuna> Well it was 40k inspired, so...
[0:26:12] <linSP> not enough I bet
[0:26:12] <%SivSarcast> It's for a Command & Conquer mod, actually.
[0:26:13] <%gatorafan> sajamMouse
[0:26:18] <Fuji808> Disco Elysium was my GOTY of 2019.
[0:26:20] <mr_sups> Not Woolie birthday
[0:26:26] <Asuterisuku> That's why you publish under a pseudonym
[0:26:28] <leith_aziz> @Sadnehs: I remember finding out about it on a iceberg video. Was like "WHAT?"
[0:26:37] <Blank9> sick animations, but also so many options out of moves and the guard points on most everything
[0:26:40] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Woolie and Reggie, did you watch the Ghanian Mortal Kombat yet?
[0:26:40] <derap41> @MrPedrovsky The Best Selling author Lindsay Ellis
[0:26:43] <%gatorafan> @sivsarcast that much for a mod? Is it Mental Omega?
[0:26:46] <dukenux> I still don't know if Harry is his actual real name
[0:26:48] <%Exiliator> Lots of fun! Lots of depression! :(
[0:26:49] <%krispen_wa> disco elysium is my GOTD
[0:26:49] <%hax_metatron> It's up there with Dark Souls annd Planescape Torment for my top 3 games of all time
[0:27:05] <andre11dr> Flesh Gundam? isn't that just Escaflone
[0:27:06] <%hax_metatron> TONS AND TONS of art
[0:27:08] <%hax_metatron> MERCH
[0:27:10] <dukenux> not only lots of content, but fucking QUALITY content too.
[0:27:12] <leith_aziz> The writing of the game is so good. Only issue is that its too good for me, cause im clearly not old enough to grasp some concepts
[0:27:18] <MrPedrovsky> @derap41 Wait. Nostalgia Chick. THE author of the “Rape Rap” Now writes books???
[0:27:24] <Blank9> There's some incredible older concept art too that some of the fanart's hitting
[0:27:31] <leith_aziz> But I can appreciate it for what it is
[0:27:32] <%Exiliator> Harry has so many stands, but they dont have any powers!
[0:27:33] <griffgrundlepunch> Straight up. I'm procrastinating beating the game because of how good it is.
[0:27:51] <Asuterisuku> Woolie never feels guilt.
[0:27:52] <+Vigonept> i could beat dio
[0:27:55] <%X2Eliah> @MrPedrovsky Oh fuck off you hateful goblin, she has documented full clear that that video was 1) a way of coping with her own experience, and 2) made public without her consent
[0:28:05] <andre11dr> Just shoot him
[0:28:06] <Equirah> it *makes* you
[0:28:08] <derap41> @MrPedrovsky yes
[0:28:14] <%Lion_kun> You can't control feeling guilty woolie
[0:28:14] <leith_aziz> Maybe Okuyasu if im smart enough
[0:28:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> @leith_aziz In all fairness, It gets pretty in the weeds on some subjects. I'd be surprised if the average person could follow it all 100%
[0:28:23] <%Juriasu> monkaS
[0:28:33] <Blank9> You can if you can direct guilt towards "this dude's doing it on purpose FUCK THIS GUY" anger
[0:28:35] <Asuterisuku> That's a Telltale Heart scenario.
[0:28:36] <AvroEltz> The lock over heaven
[0:28:43] <derap41> @MrPedrovsky Have you watched it even
[0:28:43] <dukenux> Koichi stand should technically be useless against clinical psychopaths, so like half of the enemy Stand users
[0:28:44] <andre11dr> A lot of stands can infact be beat by a gun ,as long as it's not 5 or 7
[0:28:47] <%smyld> The Lock - “you’re black”

[0:29:25] <the_angelon_experience> Her name is Loremaster
[0:29:31] <MrPedrovsky> @x2eliah Without her consent in the middle of her video? That she made and posted and took down after the hate? Who wrote skits about it all around the rap segment? No way bro Kappa Read up on kiwi farms or watch Mr.Metokour documentary
[0:29:34] <Asuterisuku> We already know what Cyberdemons look like though!
[0:29:36] <servicesuspension> some kind of BioCurse
[0:29:36] <primaryfire> doom eternal

[0:30:54] <%Exiliator> Did Minh spend all the budget on gatcha?
[0:31:03] <derap41> Whatever happened to Spoony? is he off his meds
[0:31:09] <%thetunnelhomer> I think he'
[0:31:09] <MrPedrovsky> @thetunnelhomer But you wouldn’t consider aborted one a baby. So technically she didn’t have one
[0:31:12] <servicesuspension> revelaitons
[0:31:15] <dukenux> I love how pretense-less Helltaker is
[0:31:29] <Blackleafx> Read the book when it comes out
[0:31:30] <%thetunnelhomer> Homeless* Last I heard the bank was foreclosing on him.

[0:31:34] <MrPedrovsky> @thetunnelhomer Just memes. Relax
[0:31:36] <%Juriasu> this entire game is feelings, that's what is so brilliant about it
[0:31:43] <Blank9> the concept of nothingness always goes back to Neverending Story for me

[0:32:17] <%smyld> Inland Empire?
[0:32:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> The best part is that you could easily interpret it as the main character being an anxiety ridden fuckass who literally thinks the world is ending
[0:32:28] <leith_aziz> Way tooo hard to answer
[0:32:30] <%krispen_wa> THIS IS TRUE LOVE WE'RE MAKING

[0:32:43] <andre11dr> Alpha 3 Vega is great
[0:32:44] <%Mathochism> Sun Chase Moon from SFV is the best one I can think of from recent years.
[0:32:49] <Asuterisuku> Does UNI, BB, or GG count when music is disassociated from the stage and attached to the characters instead?
[0:32:52] <+wendisky> tekken tag yoshimitsu

[0:33:08] <leith_aziz> Moonlit wilderness is a very good pick
[0:33:16] <andre11dr> No
[0:33:26] <andre11dr> The pop song is better
[0:33:34] <dukenux> is "The Pale" a reference to Nabokov's "Pale Fire" by any chance?
[0:33:35] <+LKHamJams> You made my week at Frosty Faustings Woolie. you were on commentary with my homie during samurai shodown and we still laugh about it.

[0:40:23] <Asuterisuku> So many bee stings!
[0:40:34] <dukenux> @blackleafx ah oh well. was probably a long shot. it was just a single line from a poem reminded me of it
[0:40:47] <%X2Eliah> That seems like something that could be buildable, with FPV drones and small tesla coils
[0:41:02] <%Exiliator> Red alert ost was amazing
[0:41:15] <Asuterisuku> Red Alert CUTSCENES were amazing.
[0:41:15] <+MrAtheGreat> into the wild pale yonder detectives!

[0:41:25] <Blank9> that apartment building song is so good
[0:41:27] <%hax_metatron> It's SO good though, there are some great tracks coming up
[0:41:27] <servicesuspension> it's disco in spirit
[0:41:29] <+MrAtheGreat> This ain't Yakuza 0
[0:41:33] <griffgrundlepunch> It's not about the disco of the ears, but the disco of the mind.
[0:41:35] <$JobbedBone> I'm such a mark for hero units in RTS games BibleThump every time it becomes my primary focus
[0:41:42] <ingman112> Why would it be? Disco’s dead
[0:41:45] <dukenux> Ambient Synth Elysium doesn't roll iff the tongue that well though
[0:41:51] <Blank9> hero units is why advance wars day of ruin is the best one
[0:41:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> Soundtrack definitely focuses on the Elysium part
[0:41:55] <twohitgood> soundtrack is by a band called British Sea Power.
[0:42:00] <andre11dr> No it's more sad acoustic stuff and drones
[0:42:03] <%X2Eliah> rip
[0:42:06] <Blackleafx> British Sea Power are incredible
[0:42:13] <MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus did you look up fan art recreation of how Disco World looks?????

[0:42:22] <Blackleafx> @MrPedrovsky Wait, that's a thing?
[0:42:40] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Is it somehow related to new hardware additions?
[0:42:45] <griffgrundlepunch> Oh, and Displate has metal posters of the different skills and thought cabinets, just thought I'd let yall know.
[0:42:56] <dukenux> driver updates?
[0:42:59] <MrPedrovsky> @blackleafx It was on Russian /v. Pretty accurate like 83.% with artistic flair
[0:43:08] <servicesuspension> displate has also posters of a lot of character portraits
[0:43:15] <gecomaman> Hopefully they take a look at the quest log, now that’s it the start of a new day. Plenty of tasks to do with the lorry drivers.
[0:43:15] <$JobbedBone> the displate for suggestion ruined it FeelsBadMan
[0:43:17] <Blackleafx> @MrPedrovsky Huh, neat. Can you whisper me a link?

[1:30:12] <primaryfire> that's also why shivers is so cool. it adds so much detail they couldn't have done audiovisually
[1:30:16] <%hax_metatron> I don't think you're supposed to interalize ALL the names. It's to convey the ... feeling
[1:30:17] <+illusiveSaint> same it sometimes get overwhelming for me
[1:30:20] <%dalmek> it's also good if that doesn't happen, because it makes the names more familiar for the future

[1:41:39] <%emperordread> @servicesuspension This is literally the entire thing in a nutshell
[1:41:52] <DatAsuna> The worst shit is people here in the UK saying we should switch to the american system
[1:41:53] <derap41> Its terrible now with it its going to be even worse
[1:41:56] <DSD24> So I'm unfamiliar with Death Panels do those decided if someone lives or dies?
[1:41:57] <wibbwobbler> Death panels sound pretty dang scary
[1:42:01] <%wolfofsound> "but the hospital will run like the DMV!"
[1:42:06] <Asuterisuku> @DatAsuna Oh my god why

[1:42:17] <%emperordread> @DatAsuna That's only Nigel Farage though tbh
[1:42:17] <derap41> @wibbwobbler better call it insurance board
[1:42:22] <DatAsuna> @Asuterisuku cause they're rich tories with friends who'd make money off it
[1:42:24] <Fuji808> Government death panels, far worse than corporate death panels. MUHGUH
[1:42:26] <%KineticZen> Psychosomatism
[1:42:35] <%X2Eliah> Reverse Placebo
[1:42:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[1:42:39] <Asuterisuku> NOBODY wants the US system.
[1:42:41] <DatAsuna> @emperordread I wish it was only him
[1:42:42] <%nicversus> At the beginning of the pandemic, I worked with a guy who was an anti-masker because he didn't trust doctors, so he just drank bleach
[1:42:43] <servicesuspension> placebo boolsheet
[1:42:43] <SomeAsianDood> "just get over it"
[1:42:48] <heemwizard> ah mental health is bad here in asia
[1:42:52] <Asuterisuku> Except for the people who stand to make a profit from it.
[1:42:56] <%X2Eliah> ... It does track with all the weird shit Japanese media shows
[1:42:57] <derap41> yeah its like praying away the cancer
[1:43:02] <miucsa51> "just get over it bro"
[1:43:04] <%SivSarcast> @heemwizard Yeah it's not great.
[1:43:05] <derap41> Its still very much there
[1:43:06] <servicesuspension> *potemkin theme plays"
[1:43:06] <Estwilde> "Just grow up. Don't be a baby. You're doing it to yourself"
[1:43:06] <tomo_vendor> Japan does have a gigantic 'jut fit in' culture, yeah.
[1:43:12] <+Bitscreed> "Walk it off."
[1:43:12] <ToxInjection> I feel like that can go for a lot of PoC cultures
[1:43:13] <%wolfofsound> well the scuicide rates reflect that
[1:43:16] <tomo_vendor> It's a if the nail stands out just hammer it kinda thing
[1:43:16] <Chatterbox1991> Litterally Eastern Psychology vs Western Psychololgy
[1:43:18] <ingman112> Right here it's saying: If whatever you have can be cured by just positive thinking, then it probably wasn't real. At least in terms of physical health
[1:43:26] <andre11dr> Yeah it's putting hope in some placebo bullshit
[1:43:28] <Fuji808> "The nail that sticks out will be hammered down." - Japan
[1:43:29] <miucsa51> Deal wit it mentality
[1:43:35] <GarbageNirvana> suicide rates in Japan are high for a reason, or were at least

[1:43:58] <user_naim> @fuji808 that one is always so wild to me

[1:45:29] <Fuji808> Self-flaggelation?
[1:45:31] <drunken_lemur> Like a Turkish bath house
[1:45:31] <dukenux> birch slapping is a real thing
[1:45:31] <Johannen> That's just sauna
[1:45:32] <ToxInjection> Very true
[1:45:35] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[1:45:35] <servicesuspension> it's just a fact of life, but healing tho?

[1:45:39] <%nicversus> I'm on that new diet PALEo
[1:45:41] <%X2Eliah> Pale is real ergo pale magic is real
[1:45:43] <DatAsuna> That's just a sauna
[1:45:51] <%emperordread> We're too cowardly to explore the Deep Ocean, no one goin near The Pale LUL

[1:46:11] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus I think Frittte has Pale Aged Vodka
[1:46:16] <%dalmek> I can easily imagine this is how you invent Dune's spice
[1:46:18] <Asuterisuku> Alleged.
[1:46:20] <%nicversus> this is like putting stuff in a bog to preserve it but in reverse
[1:46:22] <derap41> you sure this isn't just a sauna session
[1:46:23] <%X2Eliah> USEFUL

[2:05:07] <dds333a> @dsd24 My books are TOO STRONG for you, Detective
[2:05:08] <Blackleafx> French is French :)
[2:05:08] <Tiittamari> nothing scarier than an office space
[2:05:10] <aewheros> French is Suresne
[2:05:12] <Asuterisuku> This game is a French game.
[2:05:13] <SomeAsianDood> I mean the body isn't gonna move any time soon
[2:05:15] <die_hardman> how close r we to a certain copotype chat?
[2:05:17] <Blackleafx> Revachol was settled by people from Not-French

[2:05:43] <SomeAsianDood> @die_hardman he's internalized hobo and apocalypse
[2:05:49] <Blackleafx> @die_hardman a long way tbh
[2:06:00] <andre11dr> It has a bunch of euro ascents
[2:06:02] <Blackleafx> at least from my own experience
[2:06:09] <servicesuspension> Revachol is multicultural, but mostly french
[2:06:15] <%jepupu> Cunoesse is Finnish kind of, but that's about it afaik
[2:06:16] <dds333a> Martinique
[2:06:16] <Blackleafx> Woolie, its a world where specific fictional nations correspond to real world cultures
[2:06:28] <+Kataguro> Baha the French...champagne
[2:06:32] <derap41> Revachol is in the middle a melting  pot you could say
[2:06:34] <+illusiveSaint> it's like st. maarten it's Carib and french/dutch
[2:06:35] <Blackleafx> Martinique and Martinaise is clever
[2:06:36] <Robot_Nixon_> CUNO IS CUNO
[2:06:36] <user_naim> Makes sense for what is still a colony
[2:06:38] <tomo_vendor> Call me Manaña is straight up south american stuff
[2:06:43] <%hax_metatron> Look at map
[2:06:45] <Blackleafx> Revachol is a reference to Ravanchol, a French anarchist
[2:06:49] <+Joe2187> check your task sections
[2:06:50] <aewheros> Sur la Clef is basically France.
[2:06:56] <+OblivionSword1> check your journal

[2:07:02] <%hax_metatron> Picture map is available now btw
[2:07:02] <ingman112> Not a bad idea
[2:07:03] <Blackleafx> @aewheros France/Switzerland
[2:07:05] <derap41> Not like you're using Auth
[2:07:10] <yomamma133713> use it for rerolls honestly
[2:07:15] <primaryfire> 4 is the threshold for medium difficulty passives
[2:07:17] <+OblivionSword1> MOAR SHIVERS
[2:07:21] <tomo_vendor> Boat lady's boat is also named Cor-de-Leite, which is portuguese PogChamp
[2:07:24] <+Vivaciousx3> saving points for rerolls is usually good
[2:07:26] <servicesuspension> half light at 1 :( you can't feel the FEAR
[2:07:28] <derap41> the difference between low and nothing doesn't do much
[2:07:32] <Asuterisuku> Savoir Faire needs some love.
[2:07:41] <heemwizard> probably should save some for the hanged man and footsteps
[2:07:49] <Blackleafx> @primaryfire arent the passies just secret dicerolls? Theyre not "have this skill to unlock it", its just that it does the dice thingies behind the scenes
[2:07:56] <dds333a> Savoir Faire really suffering LUL

[2:08:48] <SomeAsianDood> there we go
[2:08:51] <andre11dr> I love how the racist cup is always the first item on the menu LUK
[2:08:54] <dds333a> There it is
[2:08:56] <Ids560> now yo can mouse over the checks to see about where they are
[2:08:57] <derap41> big egg
[2:09:04] <servicesuspension> It looks way prettier
[2:09:07] <Blackleafx> "Revachol Zone of Control"
[2:09:12] <servicesuspension> Look they even had a wheel
[2:09:12] <aewheros> You mean the Borg Cube?
[2:09:15] <ingman112> Remember this is an outdated tourist map though
[2:09:19] <servicesuspension> or planned one at least
[2:09:23] <+Count_Viscount> I left for a minute are we behind the curtain yet?
[2:09:24] <%hax_metatron> No it was spruced up for tourist map purposes remember
[2:09:26] <ingman112> So some of these things were never built
[2:09:33] <primaryfire> did woolie analyse the broken billboard in the waterlock?
[2:09:34] <iacus_> and it tells you the white checks
[2:09:38] <derap41> this place looked a lot nice 3 years ago
[2:09:42] <Blackleafx> By rpg standards, its pretty big
[2:09:44] <+Joe2187> You can see the pale in the upper right
[2:09:44] <sahr_zand> It's like an Avant-gArde map
[2:09:46] <Blackleafx> by irl standards, ts small
[2:09:47] <tomo_vendor> @ingman112 it was a map made for the upcoming attractions, yeah
[2:09:54] <Blackleafx> @Joe2187 Thats not the pale
[2:10:05] <derap41> that's water
[2:10:09] <servicesuspension> yep, some of these things were not build, this is a map of how Revachol was going to be... which fits the theme
[2:10:12] <Timarkot> What a confusing map
[2:10:14] <Blackleafx> The pale is several hundrds of kilometers away
[2:10:15] <user_naim> Outdated concept art is a nice balance to the usual hyper accurate video game maps
[2:10:27] <+alpharius88> Warhammer 40k door
[2:10:42] <+Kataguro> The Kyuubey is in there

[2:18:47] <Johannen> Woolie needs to embrace the communism more, the failure was not yet internalized
[2:18:48] <Asuterisuku> The flashlight moves with your mouse... Whew.
[2:18:51] <servicesuspension> they call it "paintshading"
[2:18:53] <derap41> Ghosts
[2:19:09] <DSD24> Was Okami paintshading?
[2:19:17] <%X2Eliah> what
[2:19:17] <SomeAsianDood> demijohn is just a big jar
[2:19:25] <aiutare47> It’s a jug used in moonshine
[2:19:28] <derap41> THis looks like the lair of a serial killer
[2:19:29] <BlackermanZX> a half john StinkyGlitch
[2:19:32] <Asuterisuku> Ayy, 3Real
[2:19:33] <servicesuspension> I don't know, Zaum came up with the term
[2:19:34] <%jepupu> I've seen this scene in Silent Hill 2
[2:19:40] <+Prevot> always with the fucking mannequins
[2:19:43] <+OblivionSword1> 3 Real richer
[2:19:49] <servicesuspension> This is so SH
[2:20:19] <derap41> They have Such Sights to show you
[2:20:21] <servicesuspension> A Silent Hill like this would actually be kinda cash

[2:21:11] <user_naim> @sebenoth defeated
[2:21:14] <derap41> Don't you dare sell it
[2:21:19] <%SivSarcast> I guess the cube is the equivalent of a "disk" in this world.
[2:21:31] <derap41> pretty much
[2:21:31] <Asuterisuku> I bet that's the radiocomputer.
[2:21:34] <Ids560> Harry's Silent Hill would suck
[2:21:39] <DSD24> @Asuterisuku Nice job
[2:21:42] <user_naim> Oh yeah, a Silent Hill by these guys, if they wanted to do it, would be the greatest
[2:21:56] <servicesuspension> Physics and even data work different in this world it seems

[2:23:32] <derap41> @RaiNiMayonnaise manual cloud computing
[2:23:41] <+OblivionSword1> it's a computer that the the whole computing on the radio

[2:24:02] <%PMAvers> Human Two-Factor Authentication.
[2:24:04] <Mattais88> Swordfish, it's alweays swordfish
[2:24:06] <+illusiveSaint> @reallybigrocks my guess it's wifi with ham radioes
[2:24:07] <derap41> Radio instead of internet
[2:24:08] <the_angelon_experience> it's radio internet
[2:24:26] <servicesuspension> Oh fuck, imagine having to contact an operator to use the internet
[2:24:53] <SomeAsianDood> does Harry even know his birthday?
[2:24:56] <%nicversus> aw c'mon lady, gimme a hint

[2:25:21] <gunsrlove> Hey Terminal Lady, why do you look like a ghoul nightmare
[2:25:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> If that were the case then this is the equivalent of having to use the internet to access the data on a CD. Radiocomputers work completely differently from what we know

[2:25:50] <derap41> you're just contacting someone else who uses a computer

[2:33:02] <ulcaban> Kim is into it!
[2:33:04] <ToxInjection> Kim is BIG nerd
[2:33:05] <servicesuspension> Kim's showing the nerdy side
[2:33:13] <SivSarcast> I would go as far as to say this part of the conversation is very un-Kim-like.

[2:36:01] <Blank9> we're here to implement LEAN
[2:36:01] <+Jeshk0> that would never happen, reggie
[2:36:09] <%livlinn> TOO REAL NotLikeThis
[2:36:11] <%X2Eliah> Every management process can be improved by adding more and more meetings to the day
[2:36:12] <miucsa51> NotLikeThis too real
[2:36:13] <Iza_kku> hey that happens in warehouses too
[2:36:14] <Crippl3> time for the morning scrum

[2:36:19] <+illusiveSaint> :(
[2:36:20] <Iza_kku> that exact thing
[2:36:20] <gfbagel> im just gonna keep pushing this boulder, im too busy to put it in your wagon technology
[2:36:20] <Johannen> But how would Higher Ups understand that middle managment is doing its job if they dont implement stuff

[2:36:46] <%SivSarcast> Too real, Reggie?
[2:36:52] <Estwilde> @X2Eliah I imagine that a lot of those meetings tend to get scheduled around 4 pm too, right? :)
[2:37:06] <%KineticZen> Outsourcing and management bullshit, name a more deadly combo
[2:37:10] <servicesuspension> pat was right: work sucks and jobs are stupid
[2:37:20] <%X2Eliah> @Estwilde One to start the day, one to cap it off, and some around lunchtime for progress updates :)
[2:37:21] <derap41> Cuno has it figured out
[2:37:28] <Sir_Yiffsalot> bosom
[2:37:53] <ingman112> I'd be willing to be that's how they did it
[2:38:00] <ingman112> Find anywhere that you can insert a line from a personality
[2:38:13] <Blank9> they add branches specifically for observations made passively by your skills too
[2:38:14] <servicesuspension> Kurvitz says he ruminated on a piece of dialogue for like 6 months
[2:38:14] <Blank9> it's insane
[2:38:15] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, they are literal characters
[2:38:16] <teefpal> I'm amazed it took only 3 years
[2:38:39] <Johannen> There are no branches, just additional dialogue added by stat checks
[2:38:43] <ToxInjection> I feel like some skills focus more on conversations and dialogue than your immediate environment though.
[2:38:44] <derap41> I cheated this game last time and maxed all stats it was like being beaten by words
[2:38:44] <+Mrbaconator> ye making an RPG with comprehensive outcomes is rad but an inhuman amount of work
[2:39:06] <derap41> every other action lead to all thought triggering and bombarding me
[2:39:09] <ingman112> @derap41 I still need to do that

[2:42:39] <%SivSarcast> Dorime hands? :V
[2:42:39] <iacus_> the steeple is one type of gesture called "cradle"
[2:42:43] <Johannen> Would you cris-cross your fingers theu each other?
[2:42:45] <357Sneak> FBBlock PrideHeartR The Triangle of contemplation
[2:43:09] <drunken_lemur> D&D over CB?
[2:43:15] <servicesuspension> that sounds like a devastating job
[2:43:17] <teefpal> And this was a "role-playing game?"
[2:43:27] <DSD24> Anyone can Radio in right?
[2:43:32] <ingman112> And across continents, too
[2:43:32] <yomamma133713> it would be impossible to dm possibly thousands at once
[2:43:32] <ToxInjection> the ambition NotLikeThis
[2:43:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> All those Radiocomputer simulation games coming out of Konigstein
[2:43:34] <derap41> it was
[2:43:43] <+illusiveSaint> the first LAN party game?
[2:43:44] <teefpal> "What kind of nerds would play such a game?"
[2:43:46] <asurite_warrior> This sounds like a forums based role play game
[2:43:50] <Louie_Salmon> Playing RPGs across massive gaps of anti-matter
[2:43:50] <servicesuspension> Anyone with a radiocomputer, which seem to be rare
[2:43:53] <derap41> Imagine a DnD session with thousands of people 1 round  would take months
[2:43:53] <Blackleafx> HIRE THIS MAN

[2:44:07] <iacus_> all the cash
[2:44:08] <Indigo_Automaton> It so is
[2:44:08] <%PMAvers> You know, it's nice to know that Dennis Dyack was able to get himself back on his feet and shove another company's money into his beard, even if it took him being transported to a different universe.
[2:44:10] <iacus_> definitely
[2:44:11] <dukenux> ALL IN
[2:44:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> NINTENDOOOOO Hire this man
[2:44:12] <SomeAsianDood> hmmm someone should
[2:44:13] <Blackleafx> This is a parody of disco elysium
[2:44:17] <ingman112> SHOVEL MONEY INTO THE FURNACE
[2:44:21] <Asuterisuku> A kickstarter than never happened
[2:44:21] <primaryfire> za/um used to be called fortress occident
[2:44:22] <servicesuspension> Fortress Accident was ZAUM's old name
[2:44:23] <+Bitscreed> The 38 Studios of Revachol
[2:44:23] <vadnhi> Remember way back when this was ostensibly about solving some hanged guy's murder? :/
[2:44:26] <Indigo_Automaton> Or a multiplayer Disco Elysium
[2:44:26] <iacus_> it's an allusion to their previous attempt at an rpg
[2:44:27] <DevilHands_> Knowing Za/um? Most certainly
[2:44:27] <DSD24> Wow
[2:44:31] <sirtommygunn> I was going to say "I doubt they're using something as complex as D&D for their system" but it's well established these devs were complete idiots
[2:44:33] <fritz_dacat> Kickstart this please
[2:44:34] <saloghost> ZA/UM wa sonce called...Fortress Accident ;)
[2:44:35] <andre11dr> I think It's more of a comment on this in general
[2:44:44] <ingman112> @andre11dr Probably both
[2:44:48] <ToxInjection> When you don't suck the Graad's developers dicks :(
[2:44:50] <LeeleeBB> it's more an allegory for disco elysium itself
[2:44:58] <357Sneak> Support the Anime, read the Manga
[2:45:01] <Blackleafx> No, Za/UM was called "Fortress Occident"
[2:45:02] <%fetrigon> yep
[2:45:02] <+Joe2187> The Revechol kickstarter is called "Real-Raoder"
[2:45:04] <%wolfofsound> LUL take that L
[2:45:07] <Blackleafx> fortress Accident is a pun on Occident
[2:45:09] <ingman112> YES

[2:45:17] <teefpal> ooooof
[2:45:18] <iacus_> it's not Disco, I think. Disco Elysium was a great success
[2:45:19] <ToxInjection> Y'know what... yeah, the game really is LUL
[2:45:21] <%SivSarcast> Harry & Kim Figure it Out

[2:46:13] <andre11dr> I love how you can make your caracter to just straight up believe in the curse LUL
[2:46:18] <fritz_dacat> Never
[2:46:25] <miucsa51> there is a man who has artistic vision
[2:46:27] <%fetrigon> much respect to the devs for allowing themselves to be this vulnerable in front of all their players
[2:46:33] <user_naim> Make the Restored Content Mod in the middle of a murder investigation
[2:46:34] <yomamma133713> hold it regardless
[2:46:38] <fritz_dacat> Nintendo gave you a calculator what else ya want
[2:46:45] <Johannen> Why is Woolie so adamant about authority?
[2:46:48] <ingman112> That's honestly a good plan
[2:46:51] <+Joe2187> No clue
[2:46:52] <servicesuspension> ZA/UM is composed of people who had never made a game. Someone who's worked on the game industry would have thought the project was doomed from the start. We need more people who have never made games to make games
[2:46:52] <ingman112> So he can equip the ledger
[2:46:55] <teefpal> Kim, do you know how to use Unreal Engine 3?
[2:46:57] <%X2Eliah> @Johannen He feels an internal calling, a kinship
[2:46:57] <%ekodrop> brrr
[2:47:00] <Asuterisuku> Half-Light is low?
[2:47:07] <+OblivionSword1> @Johannen cause the ledger is -2 authority
[2:47:08] <Narbarec> Motorics make for good support skills tbh
[2:47:10] <Iza_kku> i forget if woolie finished the chalkboard options off, or if he reloaded and already did them
[2:47:10] <%ChoculaUltra> its one thing to acknowledge your failures - it's another thing entirely to put them all on display while critiquing them LUL
[2:47:12] <+MrAtheGreat> Half-light ain't TOO necessary
[2:47:18] <ingman112> That's from clothes
[2:47:20] <%X2Eliah> Half light at 4+ is cool tho
[2:47:34] <extradopeness> kim put mario in UE3 hire this man nintendo
[2:47:34] <servicesuspension> Yeah, check clothes for bonuses
[2:47:38] <%hax_metatron> 2 AUTH is good
[2:47:44] <derap41> Low auth is the same as no Auth
[2:47:45] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Not with the clipboard you wont
[2:47:46] <iacus_> yeah, something with the sheer crafsmanship of disco elysium would be dismissed by eny experienced designer. They were crazy to pull it off, but I'm glad it worked out
[2:47:46] <%hax_metatron> And you need it for some checks
[2:47:51] <andre11dr> EVENTUALLY Half Light will be useful
[2:47:53] <Johannen> You wont hear it that much when it will be at 2)
[2:47:59] <primaryfire> 4 auth is a good spot to be
[2:48:01] <teefpal> Low auth can be dangerous
[2:48:06] <Timarkot> Just ignore authority until later
[2:48:11] <teefpal> Makes you more likely to flip out
[2:48:13] <Blank9> you can ignore everything luckily
[2:48:21] <1000_buffers> @WoolieVersus got my brother to binge all of your kirby lore videos FishMoley
[2:48:26] <andre11dr> Half life is just useful to tell if someone is about to jump you
[2:48:27] <derap41> Auth can be boosted a lot
[2:48:33] <primaryfire> auth is important when interrogating suspects
[2:48:36] <+OblivionSword1> go pantless
[2:48:36] <Indigo_Automaton> Change pants and shoesd?
[2:48:40] <Blank9> makes high physical even while being sober funny to have electrochemistry just on your shoulder always
[2:48:44] <ingman112> With low authority you're basically a doormat
[2:48:51] <ingman112> Can't assert yourself when needed
[2:49:06] <derap41> Auth can be made u pfor with clotches
[2:49:20] <ingman112> Very nice
[2:49:24] <%X2Eliah> man Woolie will have a hard time with clothing balancing when he has like 30 items :)
[2:49:25] <andre11dr> Good that looks dumb LUL
[2:49:34] <andre11dr> Fitting i guess
[2:49:34] <%hax_metatron> Doorway to the right
[2:49:44] <servicesuspension> In fact, the real ugly authority moments come when you fail a check, because being an asshole usually stems from an inferiority complex
[2:49:45] <derap41> Perception failed
[2:49:46] <primaryfire> yeah pat said the other tday that the only part he doesn't like about the game is the clothes management for stats
[2:50:21] <ingman112> I unno man
[2:50:31] <derap41> Wish you didn't have to hot swap clothes but do a 1 time choice for them
[2:50:33] <Johannen> Yeah stats on clothes are annoying, just keep em as clothes
[2:50:37] <+MrAtheGreat> @primaryfire Yeah, it gets freaking terrible once that inventory is full. This game is in dire need of a sort function
[2:50:46] <Johannen> Drama clothes make no sense
[2:50:49] <%nicversus> Reality is entirely devoid of Ruth
[2:50:52] <%nicversus> it's ruthless
[2:50:58] <Blank9> welcome to the ski and/or rotor blade shop
[2:50:59] <servicesuspension> Next Zaum game is probably gonna change the clothes system
[2:51:01] <primaryfire> it would be neat if there was a "maximise for x stat" button
[2:51:07] <%X2Eliah> Those pants have performance crotchoh man boss time

[2:53:57] <+Prevot> that's beary cool

[2:54:06] <user_naim> @the_angelon_experience right, awesome
[2:54:06] <FassieFons> ice bear likes this fridge
[2:54:12] <andre11dr> Ummm ,what?
[2:54:15] <ToxInjection> That's a bear-y cool fridge Kappa
[2:54:19] <servicesuspension> even Kim is like what
[2:54:26] <%livlinn> joofbSip
[2:54:31] <+MidnightBurst12> I don't like the term belly door
[2:54:31] <+MrAtheGreat> @ToxInjection LUL
[2:54:36] <derap41> ITS!....Nothing
[2:54:38] <Ultimatefool> WHat's in there? "Bayonetta 3"
[2:54:41] <%ChoculaUltra> so there's this one episode of Pokemon with a giant bouncy room in the shape of a Pikachu. Except they put the door where it's genitals would be.
[2:54:42] <vadnhi> The LaBatt Blue Bear! :O ...Aww! Lookit what they've done to you!
[2:54:42] <primaryfire> the light doesn turn off when the door is closed? tf kinda fridge is this
[2:54:44] <ingman112> Kyle Rayner's gf is in there
[2:54:45] <Blackleafx> :)
[2:54:50] <+MrAtheGreat> same when I first played

[2:54:50] <+OblivionSword1> LUL
[2:54:52] <Blank9> a smaller bear falls out
[2:54:53] <Eger007> hehe...
[2:55:01] <derap41> not even icecream

[2:55:31] <357Sneak> marrHiYo
[2:55:41] <+MrAtheGreat> HYPERCARNIVORE
[2:55:43] <derap41> clearly its the CURSE!
[2:55:51] <Asuterisuku> When was the expiration date?
[2:55:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> Kim gets oddly enthusiastic about the strangest things
[2:55:58] <servicesuspension> what do you mean that's so metal
[2:56:01] <%wolfofsound> we have a brand around here that a polar bear is the mascot wearing shades LUL
[2:56:02] <+MrAtheGreat> LUL Get fucked bear-makers
[2:56:29] <%nicversus> What would you do for a Kodak Bar
[2:56:30] <%elhafnero> what would you do... for a klondike bear
[2:56:30] <Indigo_Automaton> All Polar Bears are murderers
[2:56:37] <die_hardman> There was a shivers check here :( :(
[2:56:45] <%nicversus> *kodiak
[2:56:48] <dukenux> LUL
[2:56:51] <user_naim> Doomed Commercial Area indeed
[2:56:54] <%X2Eliah> Ice cream machines seem like such a scam
[2:57:02] <%wolfofsound> mom can I get ben and jerry's? we have ice cream at home
[2:57:05] <servicesuspension> Seems Kim is really interested in minutiae, he's probably acting so professional to not get distracted
[2:57:05] <%nicversus> Ice Cream at Home(tm)
[2:57:10] <Darren716> Ice cream machines suck
[2:57:12] <Narbarec> @die_hardman Shivers to 6 is the dream
[2:57:33] <die_hardman> @narbarec agreed
[2:57:36] <vadnhi> No wonder this commercial area was so doomed... It apparently has Monster-Hunter predators wandering about its environs...
[2:57:51] <servicesuspension> cuno you dickhead
[2:57:52] <ToxInjection> CUNO DOESN'T CARE
[2:57:54] <%nicversus> Cuno was here
[2:57:55] <+Prevot> fucking cuno
[2:57:58] <Hammatime8> Fuckin' Cuno
[2:58:17] <vadnhi> Not even the Bear was enough to dissuade Cuno.
[2:58:20] <teefpal> the Entity?
[2:58:22] <+Ensign_Epic> cuno the legend
[2:58:23] <%nicversus> Of course Cuno was here. Cuno is everywhere. Cuno is omipresent.
[2:58:31] <%nicversus> *omnipresent
[2:58:50] <teefpal> Kim, what is a computer?
[2:58:50] <%wolfofsound> Kappa
[2:59:06] <aewheros> Cuno doesn't care about letters and shit
[2:59:12] <ToxInjection> Cuno's not a fucking radiocomputer expert!
[2:59:13] <Blackleafx> yes
[2:59:14] <Iwashi94> "Fuck does Cuno care?"
[2:59:17] <derap41> Pawning it for speed ey?
[2:59:19] <ingman112> Yeah lore is lore
[2:59:20] <+Kataguro> Exp is learning shit
[2:59:22] <%Juriasu> you don't *have* to do anything
[2:59:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does the game ever go into detail about how radiocomputers work
[2:59:24] <Blackleafx> thats what we've been saying, for like 5 streams, woolie
[2:59:26] <terrorengine> Geez, how old was Cuno when this happend?
[2:59:26] <yomamma133713> free content too
[2:59:29] <%X2Eliah> You don't *have* to
[2:59:30] <%SivSarcast> Cuno's not a fucking SCIENTIST
[2:59:33] <RaiNiMayonnaise> video games!
[2:59:34] <servicesuspension> Exp is for content, whatever it might be
[2:59:37] <%PMAvers> I mean, I guess you could get down here without meeting Cuno.
[2:59:40] <ToxInjection> Show the fridge the mug
[2:59:42] <terrorengine> this place looks ancient
[2:59:50] <heemwizard> ah this part is good
[2:59:57] <GarbageNirvana> I think you get XP every time a successful passive stat tells you to do something
[3:00:05] <+HotBloodedHero> Those orbs are free exp too, just remember that.
[3:00:08] <primaryfire> you never know what an obvious prompt might lead to
[3:00:20] <servicesuspension> this seems to be from the revolution
[3:00:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:00:31] <GarbageNirvana> sometimes passives will open up dialogue options you wouldn't have otherwise
[3:00:32] <ToxInjection> Hmmmm
[3:00:37] <%SivSarcast> Oooh pre-war stuff
[3:00:54] <%hax_metatron> The timeline of this commercial area ends here FeelsBadMan
[3:00:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> KIM! GUNS!
[3:01:21] <primaryfire> PLING
[3:01:28] <heemwizard> hold on to that
[3:01:33] <ToxInjection> Not an M1 Garand PING though :(
[3:01:35] <heemwizard> its important
[3:01:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hey, bolt action vs your muzzleloader pistol would be a massive upgrade
[3:01:47] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> "Guns not just about shooting, it's about reloading".
[3:01:48] <reonome> free gun!
[3:01:49] <Narbarec> No nock cannons though, poor hobocop
[3:01:54] <andre11dr> It IS good for survival, ask Ethan
[3:01:55] <DatAsuna> bolt actions are good when you're sniping and have good cover and that's about it.
[3:01:58] <SivSarcast> Finding a gun is always cool.
[3:02:00] <balthazar758> hell yeah
[3:02:09] <%X2Eliah> Oh no Woolie is doing a Joe Rogan again
[3:02:13] <%X2Eliah> Woolie doesnt even drive
[3:02:16] <vadnhi> "We'll get that Cunoesse for *SURE*, with *THESE!*"
[3:02:18] <%andrewofbob> Stick shift is standard in europe
[3:02:20] <iacus_> he's not wrong
[3:02:21] <+illusiveSaint> wish I knew how to drive manual
[3:02:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Everybody loves tactile feedback
[3:02:24] <+Ensign_Epic> We're physical creatures who crave physical feedback, makes sense
[3:02:25] <servicesuspension> seeing the mechanical stuff do the clicky clacky is just brain happy chemicals
[3:02:26] <ToxInjection> Never shot a gun before, but fucking with a gun's mechanics seems really soothing and cool.
[3:02:27] <user_naim> Bolt action really gets you feeling your actions.
[3:02:30] <+OblivionSword1> nah stick shift is a pain to do
[3:02:30] <iacus_> mechanical feedback is satisfying
[3:02:30] <Narbarec> Stick shift does feel rad as hell
[3:02:32] <Asuterisuku> The pushing of arcade buttons, love that click clack
[3:02:33] <zanzibarian_hamster> Like how people use zippos when standard lighters are almost infinitely more handy
[3:02:34] <balthazar758> 🚗
[3:02:38] <user_naim> Every shot has a bunch of consequences
[3:02:47] <Narbarec> Angrily shifting up a gear with the stick is kino
[3:02:49] <derap41> Zippos are cool
[3:02:50] <+Ensign_Epic> It's why a lot of people need haptic feedback on their smartphones
[3:02:57] <ToxInjection> i STILL want a Zippo just to feel cool when I smoke
[3:02:59] <+HotBloodedHero> Remember as well that their standard guns are muzzle loaders. This bolt action is till a way better gun.
[3:03:06] <aiutare47> Pumps are great
[3:03:06] <DatAsuna> pump actions specifically yeah
[3:03:16] <DatAsuna> I don't care for double barrels tho
[3:03:18] <+ALazo> they make interfacing happy
[3:03:18] <aiutare47> and a lot more useful
[3:03:22] <heemwizard> you can ask rene about it
[3:03:22] <derap41> Bolt action
[3:03:28] <Estwilde> I have an EverQuest zippo from the last SOE Live. I wonder if it's still got fuel
[3:03:32] <derap41> here Kim is with a muzzle loader
[3:03:36] <aiutare47> @DatAsuna DBs are nice when you want two different chokes
[3:03:37] <vadnhi> [Escape From Tarkov vibes, Intensify.]
[3:03:39] <DatAsuna> My favourite thing is the jank ass air rifle in metro tho
[3:03:39] <Asuterisuku> Kim said it wasn't operable.
[3:03:40] <servicesuspension> it's broken so nah
[3:03:41] <ToxInjection> Interesting - the stock almost seems backward. Never noticed that before.
[3:03:42] <Timarkot> Not a tool
[3:03:43] <yomamma133713> didnt kim say it was broken
[3:03:45] <Johannen> 4 shots that is a 400% increase in shots
[3:03:46] <ingman112> It's essentially inoperable anyway
[3:03:48] <%SivSarcast> That looks like the Harkonen from Hellsing Ultimate.
[3:03:54] <dauver> NotLikeThis
[3:03:56] <teefpal> It's broken
[3:03:57] <+illusiveSaint> it's like Albania and bunkers
[3:03:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> Nor is it a working gun
[3:04:01] <+Kataguro> It also doesn't work, so
[3:04:01] <SQDizzy> it is not a working gun
[3:04:02] <AvroEltz> woolie, ITS BROKEN
[3:04:02] <%X2Eliah> Its not usable
[3:04:03] <Johannen> Its broken Woolie
[3:04:03] <SomeAsianDood> it's broken
[3:04:04] <%kewlmyc> Bro, it doesn't work
[3:04:06] <cobalt_phoenix_> woolie it doesn't work
[3:04:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> You could still club someone with it though
[3:04:11] <%wolfofsound> that gun is like my dick FeelsBadMan
[3:04:13] <ToxInjection> Other people don't have to know it's broken
[3:04:14] <+OblivionSword1> it's broken so no way you're shooting from that
[3:04:18] <andre11dr> Well, you always har A gun
[3:04:22] <AvroEltz> what does it do in trickster?
[3:04:25] <andre11dr> But it's on Kin
[3:04:26] <%nicversus> "This is a gun. There aren't many others like it, and it's not ours."
[3:04:30] <aewheros> Who needs a gun when you have a horrific necktie
[3:04:31] <user_naim> @avroeltz lol
[3:04:39] <ToxInjection> YEEEEE, Woolie knows
[3:04:42] <Johannen> R you sure bout that?
[3:04:43] <Estwilde> Yep. all guns are loaded
[3:04:45] <Asuterisuku> Until they call your bluff.
[3:04:55] <DatAsuna> aggressive negotiations
[3:04:58] <andre11dr> That sounds like a really bad idea
[3:05:06] <yomamma133713> @ToxInjection he said no ammo, implying it would work with ammo
[3:05:20] <Robot_Nixon_> FeelsBadMan
[3:05:26] <ingman112> Pale explorer
[3:05:26] <iacus_> entrepronour
[3:05:26] <andre11dr> Don't point empty guns at people, they might have loaded ones
[3:05:28] <Blank9> like astronaut instead of astro, entro
[3:05:28] <%hax_metatron> You'll find out later
[3:05:34] <ingman112> Entropo is pale
[3:05:35] <heemwizard> ah
[3:05:38] <yomamma133713> entropy astronaut
[3:05:38] <iacus_> entropo-naut, one wh navigates the pale basically
[3:05:39] <+illusiveSaint> entropy explorer
[3:05:40] <heemwizard> never noticed that
[3:05:43] <%X2Eliah> Childhood dreams, gone
[3:05:49] <bevyrage> entroponaut is someone who explores the pale
[3:05:49] <ingman112> Yeah reggie's got it
[3:05:50] <%nicversus> I'm guessing an entroponaut is somebody who traverses the pale
[3:05:51] <servicesuspension> entroponetics is the science of the pale
[3:05:53] <Asuterisuku> Entropy?
[3:05:54] <user_naim> Joyce told us about entroponetics
[3:05:54] <+OblivionSword1> it's astronaut but for the pale
[3:06:02] <nicversus> the pale is entropy
[3:06:05] <Blank9> entroponaut sounds so much more awesome than astronaut
[3:06:12] <+ALazo> entropy astronaut
[3:06:12] <%SivSarcast> Pale surveyor, cool.
[3:06:12] <Blank9> like policenaut
[3:06:20] <ingman112> -20
[3:06:29] <ToxInjection> Yeah, this check is tough.
[3:06:33] <Johannen> DEW IT
[3:06:33] <Blackleafx> wtf was that sound
[3:06:34] <yomamma133713> 3%>0
[3:06:35] <+OblivionSword1> gonna need a super prybar
[3:06:35] <Blackleafx> ???
[3:06:37] <%nicversus> I wish there was a pale in our world. All we have is *conceptual* nihilism
[3:06:37] <andre11dr> 2 physical baby
[3:06:41] <%X2Eliah> That's a super obvious "later"
[3:06:42] <+Sebenoth> pat managed to double six this bad boy

[3:39:25] <DSD24> Weighted Die
[3:39:29] <neraren> cobalt is pretty poisonous, shouldnt be made into dice

[3:40:19] <cumurasame> @neraren wouldn't that be toxic not poisonous?
[3:40:20] <bevyrage> salt water yeah. if they sink you don't have enough salt in the water
[3:40:20] <%justcallmebobplease> If it can float to each side equally as the upright when you turn it in the water, it's equally balanced.

[3:45:47] <teflonbilly777> @fentry I want this on a t-shirt
[3:45:49] <%nicversus> it was really hard not to type SAVES CUM
[3:45:51] <+Sebenoth> inland has no chill
[3:45:59] <ToxInjection> big mood
[3:46:02] <derap41> Lofi Beats while making Dice
[3:46:08] <+Kataguro> Cuno's right over there
[3:46:08] <Blank9> it's not a big deal anyway
[3:46:14] <BlackermanZX> fuck that
[3:46:15] <Blank9> live and learn
[3:46:15] <%hax_metatron> It'
[3:46:16] <DatAsuna> own your mistakes
[3:46:17] <neostria> FUCK SOME PEOPLE
[3:46:17] <%thetunnelhomer> I am for Save scum for some stuff
[3:46:19] <+Mr_Pylon> Do what make you feel good about it
[3:46:19] <ToxInjection> I just want y'all to have fun
[3:46:20] <heemwizard> Im okay with it
[3:46:21] <%hax_metatron> It's fine nbd missing that dice is nothing big
[3:46:22] <+vaderxyz1970> Lofi Beats beats to keep out the LYNCHING
[3:46:23] <BlackermanZX> if you want to do it then do eet
[3:46:24] <derap41> Live with it
[3:46:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> there are few times to save scum, this ain't one of em
[3:46:25] <Chatterbox1991> fuck thos people; do it for her!
[3:46:26] <teflonbilly777> Live with your failures Woolie. It is the most rewarding playthrough
[3:46:30] <+OblivionSword1> eh it's fine the red one is fine on it's own
[3:46:30] <+GingerStrawhat> There are only two instances where I think Scumming is worth it but I getcha
[3:46:31] <ingman112> @cobalt_phoenix_ Agreed
[3:46:35] <iacus_> i mean scumming is established, but I think it's good to accept some consequences from time to time, too. it makes sense
[3:46:35] <Ids560> imo if you're not gonna play this game again off camera scum as much as you want
[3:46:40] <vadnhi> Straw Poll it!
[3:46:42] <%thetunnelhomer> You know what is also rewarding? Winning
[3:46:43] <FassieFons> scumming is double content
[3:46:45] <StarlitStunner> only cowards hate savescumming
[3:46:54] <derap41> in the distance "Cuno Doesn't Fucking Care"
[3:47:03] <+Standard_Enemy> Its funnier if he doesnt save scum
[3:47:08] <Blank9> I'm 100% for savescum some white checks further on because failure just means not getting content because you won't get level ups to retry.
[3:47:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Drama calling you sire is one of my favorite bits
[3:47:14] <Chatterbox1991> People are seriously too skittish about Save Scumming; i save scum everything over 20%
[3:47:16] <+Mr_Pylon> true @FassieFons summing at least doubles the content
[3:47:19] <teflonbilly777> She was black
[3:47:20] <+Vigonept> failing things you shoulda passed aint rewarding
[3:47:21] <Chatterbox1991> 15 and up sometimes
[3:47:23] <%hax_metatron> I'm glad Woolie is trusting the stats ... for now LUL
[3:47:26] <Blank9> And those retry ones aren't really funny to fail, it's just "you don't do a thing"
[3:47:29] <+fentry> what about her being secretly black huh?
[3:47:31] <+Kataguro> Yeah no, this girl is way better than Elizabeth
[3:47:31] <mariothemaio> rip
[3:47:32] <cumurasame> there's only two checks you shouldn't fail IMO because they are really wild (and one of them is really bad to fail, real bail)
[3:47:34] <ToxInjection> I really appreciate how Drama keeps referring to you like royalty. Appropriately extra.
[3:47:38] <DatAsuna> Can't fooled again
[3:47:39] <mr_sups> "Don't Overthing it"
[3:47:41] <derap41> overthinking is what you did
[3:47:42] <primaryfire> the visual calculus check with the gardener told you she was a lookout though
[3:47:42] <saloghost> Savescuming is useless for red checks. They are all fail forward. And often the failure is more itneresting storywise
[3:47:44] <Ids560> well passing the "You're black" check tells you something's up with her
[3:47:44] <DatAsuna> The game misunderestimated me
[3:47:53] <+OblivionSword1> trust your brain until it is not
[3:48:05] <+illusiveSaint> but also breaks the role playing experience or jokes so it depends
[3:48:20] <teflonbilly777> Artisinal dice
[3:48:32] <vadnhi> Fool me once: Shame on me. Fool me *twice*: How *could* you? :( ...Fool me *three* times: "Okay. you're officially 'That Guy'."

[3:49:20] <teflonbilly777> @Sebenoth Yeah, it really looks cozy
[3:49:21] <DatAsuna> Kinda jealous tbh
[3:49:27] <derap41> Inland is just making up shit now
[3:49:29] <+Kataguro> This isn't really a business that needs foot traffic.  It's very niche, probably spreads by Word of Mouth
[3:49:31] <ToxInjection> Squatting is sounding more and more appealing...
[3:49:41] <teflonbilly777> @derap41 Inland wants to believe!
[3:50:12] <primaryfire> still doesn't click lines starting with "wait"?
[3:50:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:51:08] <%wolfofsound> @derap41 people who want to get robbed
[3:51:13] <teflonbilly777> Who doesn't like a nice wet book?
[3:51:14] <mariothemaio> yeah "customers"
[3:51:20] <Asuterisuku> "Customers."
[3:51:49] <teflonbilly777> 14 years of whittling dice
[3:51:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> 14 years? How old is she?
[3:52:10] <%hax_metatron> What a wonderful conversation to end today's stream. It's been a concise exploration of this whole story thread.
[3:52:12] <derap41> 4 is just a straight lie
[3:52:17] <DatAsuna> the curse only affects those damn betaniks
[3:52:55] <derap41> whatever Inlands is smoking I want some
[3:53:09] <cumurasame> 3 is a fine option too
[3:53:16] <+Kataguro> I mean would YOU listen to Plaisance?
[3:53:18] <andre11dr> Inland Empire is such a dork ,i love him
[3:53:21] <vadnhi> "These dice are ABSORBING THE LOCAL LUCK!"
[3:53:29] <mariothemaio> Inland is great
[3:53:32] <+illusiveSaint> inland and shivers are like related lol
[3:53:37] <%hax_metatron> It's not Ultra-liberail!!!
[3:53:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PICK ONE OR FUCK OFF WOOLIE
[3:53:41] <teflonbilly777> I was fully Ultraliberal
[3:53:42] <+illusiveSaint> 1
[3:53:44] <+Kataguro> I don't think believing the economy exists is Ultra-Liberal
[3:53:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:53:45] <foxname96> Some would say a 2mm Curse Kappa
[3:53:45] <%thetunnelhomer> There is a third option right there.
[3:53:48] <Lancaster_H> how is 2 ultraliberal?
[3:53:49] <yomamma133713> how is that ultralib?
[3:53:50] <derap41> if you didn't have the ultraliberal you would only have 2 choises
[3:53:51] <+akajaybay> you're all in on inland empire and shivers but can't commit to there being a curse!
[3:53:54] <teflonbilly777> THE MARKET EXISTS
[3:53:57] <+Tacowavable> "Pick either the Crazy or Ultra option or **** off"
[3:53:58] <%nicversus> Middle grounds are for COWARDS
[3:54:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THE HAND
[3:54:05] <%hax_metatron> Drama LUL
[3:54:07] <Deasmeister> the economy existing isn't ultra
[3:54:08] <mariothemaio> @Kataguro nonsense, the market is fake liberal propaganda
[3:54:16] <%hax_metatron> Drama is a simp
[3:54:21] <derap41> Drama really going at telling you how pure and truthful she is
[3:54:23] <%wolfofsound> you mean overthinking? nah Kappa
[3:54:29] <+illusiveSaint> the invisible hand didn't reach her lol
[3:54:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fair
[3:54:31] <+akajaybay> Shivers are just a chill in the air
[3:54:31] <Asuterisuku> It's not unprompted though.
[3:54:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @teflonbilly777
[3:54:37] <+Kataguro> Yeah, but "These stupid businesses failing" is hardly a crazy fringe statement
[3:54:38] <yomamma133713> i mean youre talking about the economy
[3:54:39] <+MrAtheGreat> I like how woolie knows how there's this magical super force closing in on the world but easily dismisses tyhe idea ofa curse
[3:54:45] <DSD24> Damn
[3:54:47] <user_naim> Is drama getting a crush on her?
[3:54:47] <+Kataguro> 5 gives really cool info

[3:54:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> try it
[3:54:58] <Johannen> Its a White Check
[3:54:58] <+MrAtheGreat> try it first
[3:54:59] <zanzibarian_hamster> The curse is literally about market failures, but I get it
[3:54:59] <%bread_assassin> What do you mean "out of nowhere"? You were talking about the businesses.
[3:55:00] <cumurasame> @FoolproofDread you cannot, rip
[3:55:01] <Johannen> Try it
[3:55:02] <iacus_> why not, you're gonna up shivers again eventually
[3:55:08] <SomeAsianDood> it's a great check pass or fail
[3:55:09] <skunk1324> if you fail its a great excuse to boost shivers
[3:55:12] <+Vigonept> white, ya can retry
[3:55:14] <+Kataguro> There's some cool shit in here
[3:55:15] <DSD24> Lets be here for a hour
[3:55:16] <mariothemaio> lol
[3:55:21] <teflonbilly777> Oh man, this is a great list to go through
[3:55:21] <Ids560> since you will likely be putting more points in shivers over the course of the game, you should click it

[4:22:04] <+GingerStrawhat> You can be a decent partner, but YOUR the one in charge Woolz
[4:22:15] <Adwark> Being a boring centrist is forbidden Kappa
[4:22:23] <+nuttbrain> oooh
[4:22:26] <%hax_metatron> Having it leads to some white checks openinng
[4:22:29] <heemwizard> unlocks white checks
[4:22:29] <+Vivaciousx3> bonus to certain checks
[4:22:30] <ingman112> Open some white checks and give bonuses on a couple others
[4:22:30] <%Javaa01> It unlocks white checks
[4:22:31] <+Kataguro> Modifies some checks
[4:22:31] <Asuterisuku> Open the map and find out.
[4:22:32] <+MrAtheGreat> it adds plus one to certian modifiers
[4:22:33] <heemwizard> makes some checks easier
[4:22:35] <RedPlasticCup> Get fucked shitfingers.
[4:22:35] <%gatorafan> Opens white checks?
[4:22:36] <+physicslawyer> Opened some white checks.
[4:22:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> check map
[4:22:38] <%elhafnero> it opens white checks apparently
[4:22:39] <heemwizard> but only if you have the set
[4:22:41] <+GingerStrawhat> It opened some white checks and adds some modifiers
[4:22:42] <+Vigonept> its a die woolie
[4:22:42] <mergandew> It opens closed white checks
[4:22:43] <+Ensign_Epic> Try and search the bottom of the furnace?
[4:22:46] <primaryfire> the other dice she makes can help with some checks
[4:22:46] <+OblivionSword1> it unlocks some white check and gives bonuses to some chceks
[4:22:47] <Deasmeister> plus 1 to some checks
[4:22:47] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus It makes certain checks ewasier
[4:22:48] <Ids560> mechanically it opens some checks that have failed
[4:23:05] <Chatterbox1991> Adds Modifiers

[4:23:06] <%hax_metatron> Acquiring the dice opened up some checks for you
[4:23:10] <nelsonsaysbooya> The dice opened some back up
[4:23:11] <%Javaa01> It unlocks tries without needing to pump points
[4:23:11] <Johannen> "Items" dont do anything, if you had succeded to catch it and not overthink it it would have given you a roll boost
[4:23:13] <+illusiveSaint> it modifies some rolls
[4:23:23] <teflonbilly777> It's secret luck modifier
[4:23:27] <Mundkipz> cop checks made easier i think
[4:23:30] <+GingerStrawhat> The blue dye would have added more white opens
[4:23:33] <primaryfire> can steal the map
[4:23:39] <ingman112> And a handful of tried checks are unlocked, depending on the dice
[4:23:46] <+MrAtheGreat> Every dice improves your roll score for certain checks, you can't tell which, but it's usually 2 or 3 good ones @WoolieVersus
[4:23:49] <%hax_metatron> Maybe when you have more monney
[4:23:58] <ingman112> You can get one more set, but only one more. And it'll cost money
[4:24:00] <Lancaster_H> you couldve had a blue one yknow
[4:24:03] <peyodogo> i kinda like this outcome, ik it's a bummer but it's very in character
[4:24:10] <+OblivionSword1> maybe later when you're loaded
[4:24:12] <Mundkipz> i think the amber one helps with love check
[4:24:17] <%hax_metatron> You'll get more money don't worry
[4:24:27] <teflonbilly777> @peyodogo You kinda of want to play as a bit of a bummer
[4:24:32] <+GingerStrawhat> Time to go tell Plaisance
[4:24:35] <+GingerStrawhat> It's gone forever woolz
[4:24:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah it's gone
[4:24:38] <Johannen> It is lost to the Pale
[4:24:41] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah. It's gone foever
[4:24:43] <+icekept> its gone
[4:24:45] <SomeAsianDood> yes the blue one is poof. u can buy other dice though
[4:24:45] <peyodogo> @teflonbilly777 exactly!
[4:24:49] <ingman112> A die is probably better until you've tried more white checks, to maximize the chance that you'll unlock new ones
[4:24:50] <Lancaster_H> its gone, overthought forever
[4:24:53] <%wolfofsound> marble is gone pal
[4:24:58] <+icekept> unfortunately
[4:24:59] <%hax_metatron> It;s not that bad, it's a minute difference
[4:25:06] <Mundkipz> you miss 100% of the chances you don't take woolie
[4:25:15] <+OblivionSword1> it's like a +1 boost
[4:25:16] <%nicversus> you had a chance of catching it, but in choosing to do nothing, you chose to fail the red check
[4:25:16] <heemwizard> you need a special tool for that
[4:25:22] <heemwizard> wait until tmr at least
[4:25:35] <%hax_metatron> H/E?

[4:31:25] <+MrAtheGreat> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump I can't believe woolie failed Disco Elysium
[4:31:25] <primaryfire> bros before poos
[4:31:27] <SetsuRyuu> all stats have good and bad points. Authority is useful too (just not then)
[4:31:30] <BerryliciousDefinition> It's for honour, woolie
[4:31:34] <ingman112> In fairness, can you eat honor? What's it for? Beyond just making yourself feel good about yourself
[4:31:35] <depressioncherrie> tbh if you have played vidya for any amount of time you should be used to developers and reviewers having nothing but disdain for you.
[4:31:36] <librettodude> Frat Hazing LUL

[4:31:44] <iacus_> that's the worst part of this game by far, the writers come across as butthurt babies sometimes
[4:31:45] <%nicversus> You want to stand for the blue?  You eat the brown.
[4:31:45] <dinnydanny777> Can't believe we missed out on Kim's reaction to you shoving your own thumb up your ass limesFeels
[4:31:50] <+nuttbrain> fuck a pig's head perhaps 🤔
[4:31:50] <Picia000123> we do I promise Kappa
[4:31:50] <b_ikki> we disrespect them evenly
[4:31:50] <GarbageNirvana> just eat a bunch of tapioca beforehand what's the problem
[4:31:54] <Ids560> Honor was a specific series of actions, authority gets shat on in other ways
[4:31:54] <primaryfire> the rest of us at the precinct did it, woolie
[4:31:55] <%VyperVic> we do a little trolling
[4:31:55] <Mr_Zero5232> It’s a noir story right? Shitting on the Man is a hallmark
[4:32:04] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie could have been honorable, but he was too cowardly. He is now an HONOR POSER
[4:32:05] <Equirah> LUL
[4:32:07] <Picia000123> they are all important
[4:32:07] <ingman112> Authority's still important, don't you worry
[4:32:09] <+Jeshk0> and EC is like DO DRUGS
[4:32:09] <andre11dr> Whatever you pick, the game will shit on you eventually, even if you save scum every check, the game has something for that as well
[4:32:09] <BerryliciousDefinition> Fingers in his ass...
[4:32:12] <+illusiveSaint> i just see it all as satire it's hilarious
[4:32:15] <SetsuRyuu> any stat too high annoys you. Shivers talks too much nonsense
[4:32:21] <yomamma133713> Woolie here trying to defend his lack of honour
[4:32:27] <dauver> if only he knew the end of authority path NotLikeThis
[4:32:28] <+walternatorz> Kim has ultra authority. Kim has honour. Do you spit on Kim's honour?
[4:32:33] <b_ikki> Dishonorable man coping
[4:32:35] <%HeroToxiko> it's short for Authoritarian LUL
[4:32:36] <+zepelinnn1> yeah, its all satire and all stats can backfire, but wools wanna believe it so whatever
[4:32:41] <neostria> Just wait Authority will come in strong one day
[4:32:44] <ZE_Count> Its more like our guy is a idiot
[4:32:49] <dinnydanny777> Well you're not honourable :)
[4:32:50] <ToxInjection> TBF, Woolie wouldn't consider Shivers going off CONSTANTLY as a negative
[4:32:50] <+illusiveSaint> i wonder what Kim thinks of honor
[4:32:52] <Blank9> a thought isn't the entirety of a stat
[4:32:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[4:32:53] <teflonbilly777> Enjoy your honorable thumb!

[4:33:22] <aewheros> Oh, yes. There's one brutally important Authority check.
[4:33:22] <Mundkipz> kim has more authority then you man
[4:33:24] <+Standard_Enemy> Lol you stick the thumb up the ass and kim turns to you and goes "Ah, I remember when I started down the path of honor"
[4:33:25] <Iza_kku> my god
[4:33:32] <+vaderxyz1970> This ritual became lame after it became mainstream the old ritual was more REAL with your bros
[4:33:33] <Chogex> how clean does Kim like his thumbs
[4:33:35] <primaryfire> you don't think kim has had his fair share of ass thumbs?
[4:33:35] <+PkSilent01> Good session
[4:33:36] <cumurasame> @aewheros two in my opinion though one is optional

[4:33:42] <+nuttbrain> ggwp
[4:33:46] <Mundkipz> kim can raise an eyebrow and have you kneel

[4:34:44] <+OblivionSword1> this game is a wild ride
[4:34:48] <+Bitscreed> I'm loving every second of this playthrough.
[4:34:48] <Johannen> You were warned Woolie
[4:34:49] <ToxInjection> Oh, his response is GREAT
[4:34:49] <%gatorafan> I say, the most honorable and fraternal thing to do would be to let Kim put his finger in your butt daedra1DrunkTibs
[4:34:51] <primaryfire> the straight man for reference
[4:34:55] <iacus_> Kim is the straight man
[4:34:55] <Mr_Zero5232> Well for me it’s a must buy just based on what I’ve seen so far
[4:34:56] <Blank9> there is nothing uncomfortable about butt stuff, stop being so closeminded
[4:34:56] <+Jeshk0> dont worry about it, it gets even more brutal!
[4:34:57] <servicesuspension> You need shame

[4:35:18] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus You will almost always have someone there, because you can only earn honor through dialog
[4:35:24] <gecomaman> The load screen tip says “do crazy things, you’re a cop you’ll get away with it”
[4:35:29] <+OblivionSword1> Kim is the straight man to your dumbassery
[4:35:39] <%wolfofsound> without kim would you have poked the brown eye? @WoolieVersus
[4:35:41] <Ids560> your character can be really unstable
[4:35:44] <servicesuspension> the gaze of shame keeps you on the path
[4:35:45] <ToxInjection> They just drive a fucking truck into your expectations
[4:35:51] <Mr_Zero5232> Just blame fog of war and keep laughing at the smokestacks
[4:35:52] <teflonbilly777> Without Kim you would be pantless in that poor woman's workplace with your thumb in your ass right now!!
[4:35:53] <saloghost> @WoolieVersus Other games have a bunch of wacky side kicks to your competent main character. DE has a straight sidekick to your wacky main character
[4:35:55] <andre11dr> @gecomaman That is not always right
[4:35:57] <+illusiveSaint> you just had a sudden surge of honor you needed to respect

[4:36:12] <andre11dr> You will get killed doing some shit
[4:36:14] <+Jeshk0> the thing about the stats is that going high with them brings you to some incredible places
[4:36:16] <Blank9> woolie only thinks sexual stimulation has to be for procreation, he's going the nationalist route

[4:37:49] <+Jeshk0> how dare u
[4:37:50] <Johannen> People tend to forgive poeple of power game says
[4:37:50] <%gatorafan> Good thing we did not shoot the child... haha... daedra1DerpyTibs
[4:37:53] <ToxInjection> It doesn't want you feeling comfortable for too long
[4:37:55] <teflonbilly777> The Furies are there to make you cringe
[4:37:55] <+vaderxyz1970> No wonder people want to become cops. The shit you could get away with
[4:37:57] <b_ikki> gourmet cringe
[4:37:57] <dinnydanny777> People have to be nice to you because you're a cop, they are under an implicit threat :)
[4:38:00] <+illusiveSaint> you're a superstar cop rooEZ
[4:38:02] <mergandew> Are you saying you dislike it?
[4:38:03] <Iza_kku> the law of the land almost
[4:38:04] <GarbageNirvana> embrace it Woolie
[4:38:05] <ToxInjection> They straight up TELL you to feel free and pick the weird options
[4:38:07] <+OblivionSword1> The game WANTS you to be weird
[4:38:11] <mariothemaio> reasonable? sounds pretty centrist to me
[4:38:11] <%HeroToxiko> A reasonable cop LUL
[4:38:17] <ToxInjection> You're a cop, dude! You get away with this shit!
[4:38:18] <teflonbilly777> Reggie is reveling in this
[4:38:23] <Ids560> the game has opinions on the "Reasonable"
[4:38:23] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus Even if you do the craziest shit, everyone will forgive you. Especially Kim because he knows how bad you're messed up
[4:38:24] <Indigo_Automaton> Cringe Apocalypse Cop
[4:38:24] <peyodogo> you can be reasonable tbf, you just have to make peace with the fact that that's boring
[4:38:26] <saloghost> You can be a boring moralist cop
[4:38:26] <%nicversus> you're also playing a character whose brain is predisposed to be unreasonable
[4:38:26] <+nuttbrain> LUL
[4:38:26] <GarbageNirvana> the game is literally about failure
[4:38:27] <Asuterisuku> If Harry was reasonable his wife wouldn't have left him.
[4:38:29] <%HeroToxiko> there will be no chill
[4:38:31] <SetsuRyuu> it's just how that character works
[4:38:33] <servicesuspension> Yeah, just be weird and then reload if it gets too bad (like, child murder bad)
[4:38:35] <+HeroSolaire> Harry isn't you, YOU ARE HARRY
[4:38:36] <+zepelinnn1> YES
[4:38:37] <+UnderseaMagic> boring cop ResidentSleeper

[4:38:50] <user_naim> That man is fucked up
[4:38:51] <+xerotwo> BOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:38:52] <Chatterbox1991> Or shoot the child or ask the black lady about her music @WoolieVersus
[4:38:53] <+zepelinnn1> actually YES, dis the game
[4:38:53] <teflonbilly777> Kim would've loved it!
[4:38:54] <dinnydanny777> What a bland centrist limesYikes
[4:38:54] <T_Sasquatch> there was blackface ???
[4:38:57] <Equirah> buuuuuuuuuuuuuurns
[4:38:57] <peyodogo> ruh roh
[4:38:59] <%illtima> "Do one of those racist things or fuck off"
[4:39:02] <Johannen> LUL NO HONOUR
[4:39:05] <neostria> When else are you going to get the option?
[4:39:05] <Iza_kku> woolie staring off into the pale abyss
[4:39:06] <+ClericOfSparda> There's blackface in this game?
[4:39:06] <huskarl_zap> Grey faced centrist
[4:39:07] <andre11dr> Despite how much crazy shit you do ,Kim will still be there for you...unless your a racist, then he fucks off and lets you to your own decisions
[4:39:08] <+OblivionSword1> the game will tell woolie straight up don't worry chat
[4:39:11] <$Nullseven> That would have been a cool combo
[4:39:14] <Lancaster_H> woolie i thought you loved blackface
[4:39:14] <DatAsuna> You make the mistake of thinking the fan art cares about what you actually did
[4:39:16] <KaseKaizer> stripNote
[4:39:20] <b_ikki> lets go plague 👍
[4:39:20] <Mr_Zero5232> Could’ve set it in real life in NYC or LA in the 70s and it would’ve been just as wild
[4:39:20] <teflonbilly777> Enjoy your Badge of Shame Woolie!
[4:39:21] <+MrAtheGreat> So Woolie draws the line at fingering himself
[4:39:21] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[4:39:23] <SomeAsianDood> not anymore
[4:39:24] <ToxInjection> Gotta make that fence longer
[4:39:25] <mariothemaio> justin would approve
[4:39:26] <+wendisky> I fell asleep and woke up to blackface
[4:39:26] <Iza_kku> I'm sure, he could make time
[4:39:28] <RedPlasticCup> SHAME
[4:39:29] <user_naim> ”Do one of these racist or rapist things or fuck off”
[4:39:31] <DatAsuna> fan art don't have to be canon
[4:39:32] <Indigo_Automaton> THAT WAS YOU WOOLIE
[4:39:33] <Equirah> You hovered over fascims and went "well......." LUL
[4:39:35] <+ClericOfSparda> Shame him!
[4:39:35] <ToxInjection> AND HONOUR
[4:39:38] <%PMAvers> Plague tosses his current projects out the window and starts work on this new one ASAP

[4:39:47] <user_naim> I like Woolie’s moderation though.

[4:40:08] <+Bitscreed> "Eat your shit if you want to join the brotherhood."  - Woolie, 2020
[4:40:09] <BurlyBeef> Play the game that hates you
[4:40:11] <Indigo_Automaton> You swore to the bookeeper on your Honour Woolz
[4:40:12] <Inqy833> Authority is a great skill with terrible opinions.
[4:40:16] <+Bitscreed> *2021
[4:40:16] <teflonbilly777> This is the best playthrough
[4:40:17] <ToxInjection> I cannot WAIT for you to see the rest of the shit in this game. This is a blast every time
[4:40:20] <+illusiveSaint> Reggie will bring honor discipline and order with his thumbs :)
[4:40:23] <servicesuspension> Brownface or brownthumb, the choice is yours
[4:40:27] <iacus_> goes for uncomfortable
[4:40:30] <linSP> sooo disco tomorrow?
[4:40:36] <ToxInjection> And you CHOOSE your cringe
[4:40:38] <+MrAtheGreat> It targets everything and says "yeah do it
[4:40:38] <neostria> Man we havent even talked to the union members yet LUL
[4:40:40] <Indigo_Automaton> Until it stops being slow
[4:40:45] <peyodogo> choose your own cringe
[4:40:46] <+Reverend_Roscoe> CRINGE BE STILL
[4:40:48] <servicesuspension> It's just like playing an actual tabletop RPG
[4:40:49] <ToxInjection> You make your bed of cringe and fucking LAY in it
[4:40:49] <GarbageNirvana> how much cringe can you endure in the stop
[4:40:51] <balthazar758> cringe matrix
[4:40:52] <servicesuspension> Cringe in turns
[4:40:57] <Iza_kku> how much face can you save in the frozen time ?
[4:40:58] <BurlyBeef> The trolley problem but only one side has people on it
[4:41:01] <iacus_> it also is heavily biased enve though it wants to pretend it's not
[4:41:02] <Johannen> But can you LIVE cringe
[4:41:03] <teflonbilly777> Woolie has been taking a lot of personal damage
[4:41:05] <+Bitscreed> Either way, I am totally here for Woolie and Reggie's continued adventures in Martinaise.
[4:41:05] <%wolfofsound> I see cringe in my dreams and it hurts me mentally
[4:41:07] <%TubeMan642> How many times can you cringe in the frozen time?
[4:41:16] <teflonbilly777> YOU are Larry David now
[4:41:19] <NeonBleu> become the cringe
[4:41:23] <GarbageNirvana> so what you're saying is now that the shoes on the other foot you can't handle it
[4:41:25] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie can watch it but can't dish it
[4:41:25] <dinnydanny777> Disco Elysium makes you experience being cringe limesFeels
[4:41:26] <Indigo_Automaton> Cringe Limit Breaks
[4:41:35] <ToxInjection> Now you live in the cringe. You breathe it in and you wallow in it
[4:41:36] <andre11dr> YOU ARE THE CRINGE HERE
[4:41:37] <+Jeshk0> embrace the cringe woolie
[4:41:37] <+gregpivo> Disco: Become Cringe
[4:41:40] <user_naim> You either feel the weight of your cringe decisions, or the surprise of sudden cringe escalation
[4:41:41] <servicesuspension> @iacus_ if you think this socialist art movement studio wants to be unbiased, boy you're off base
[4:41:41] <GarbageNirvana> you can dish it out but you can't take it huh
[4:41:42] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! I've been listening to old podcasts recently, and the story of your old job getting rid of the wet naps hits different in a post 2020 world
[4:41:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you are cringe but you are free
[4:41:43] <linSP> what’s the best subreddit for cringe
[4:41:45] <iacus_> Embrace cringardice
[4:41:49] <+MrAtheGreat> Just like the real Disco, become Cringe
[4:41:50] <SetsuRyuu> embrace the cringe. Get the honour
[4:41:53] <andre11dr> HARRY'S CRINGE IS YOURS
[4:41:58] <Johannen> You merely adopted the cringe. I was born in it, molded by it
[4:41:59] <BerryliciousDefinition> "I may be cringe....but I am free"
[4:42:00] <%wolfofsound> I got that microchip baby Kappa
[4:42:09] <andre11dr> Also cringe is not even the worst it gets
[4:42:11] <@Menitta> Get dat liquid Macbook pro injection Kappa
[4:42:15] <dinnydanny777> @iacus_ I don't think it pretends it's not or that that's a bad thing tbh
[4:42:16] <Iza_kku> LMFAO I'm thinking about that long awkward hug before all thing thumb ass too
[4:42:27] <Iza_kku> this*
[4:42:39] <Asuterisuku> Bullet less than three
[4:42:58] <peyodogo> game shitting on everyone doesnt make it unbiased, it clearly has different grievances with different things
[4:43:40] <naoi0> Oh shoot are they ending up? I just joined in
[4:43:42] <ingman112> I honestly think there is something to be said for  "Honor" being characterized as a masturbatory quality. Like, what is this actually putting into the world? Who is this helping or satisfying, besides yourself?
[4:43:42] <+Jeshk0> cringe is one thing, the P A I N tho...
[4:43:43] <%Ranryu692> not what they were supposed to, probably
[4:43:53] <andre11dr> Hei chat, someone told me that somewhere in this game, the game actually lets you try a rape ,is that fucking real?
[4:44:00] <DatAsuna> "oh this job we've proven now for months you can do from home? Well come into the office anyway, now"
[4:44:05] <ingman112> @andre11dr Definitely not
[4:44:07] <Robot_Nixon_> @andre11dr, no
[4:44:08] <naoi0> @andre11dr Not to my knowledge, no?
[4:44:10] <SomeAsianDood> no @andre11dr
[4:44:12] <andre11dr> Ok
[4:44:14] <%Ranryu692> @andre11dr no
[4:44:18] <%wolfofsound> @DatAsuna that's happening in my job and it sucks
[4:44:26] <%nicversus> yeah today was all buffet, but at least it was fun!
[4:44:31] <SomeAsianDood> u can come on a little hard but that's as far as u can go I think
[4:44:31] <linSP> botched the dice, no honor, very mixed playthrough
[4:44:32] <GarbageNirvana> put Reggie in the driver's seat then God damn
[4:44:32] <naoi0> Oh are they ending?
[4:44:39] <andre11dr> Cuse i was like, ok that's to much freedom
[4:44:41] <Mr_Zero5232> Shit turned to Golden Corral rq
[4:44:47] <pi_in_the_sci> A big part "winning" in this game is restraining yourself, it's a good instinct Woolie, and one the game incourages
[4:44:47] <DatAsuna> @wolfofsound F
[4:44:50] <GarbageNirvana> if you like to watch them watch him wreck the train
[4:44:53] <dinnydanny777> Boring Copmmunist, Fascist, Ultraliberal limesHmm
[4:45:01] <+OblivionSword1> it's still early
[4:45:01] <Robot_Nixon_> @andre11dr its the subject in a conversation at most
[4:45:05] <teflonbilly777> I'm happy you learned about teh Doomed District's fate
[4:45:08] <+wendisky> 0 honour
[4:45:11] <DatAsuna> you're pretty low on most things
[4:45:13] <servicesuspension> I think it said Decline
[4:45:14] <yomamma133713> dishonourable
[4:45:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wow, Woolie is NOT SORRY at all
[4:45:15] <servicesuspension> ?
[4:45:20] <%wolfofsound> @DatAsuna AND they aren't enforcing vaccination when we go back in Sept.
[4:45:23] <DatAsuna> Spreading your points too wide just results in less content
[4:45:28] <+nuttbrain> what possible thought could that have lead to
[4:45:29] <+akajaybay> Wooly would have plugged the hole if it was clearer he was opting out
[4:45:31] <teflonbilly777> Woolie owes us a thumb in the ass!
[4:45:39] <Lancaster_H> nah not really
[4:45:39] <dauver> NotLikeThis
[4:45:41] <Johannen> Did it thou?
[4:45:42] <+zepelinnn1> no, about honor
[4:45:48] <Ids560> more like the concept of honor
[4:45:51] <Lancaster_H> literally every stat has downsides
[4:45:52] <SetsuRyuu> nah, it didnt
[4:45:53] <%wolfofsound> Kappa nice reggie
[4:45:58] <+Prevot> only lower quadrants allowed here
[4:46:01] <Ids560> every stat gets on some bullshit
[4:46:03] <servicesuspension> heh, behind us
[4:46:07] <linSP> tricked out of honor psaWhat
[4:46:11] <Iza_kku> i am glad i was here for the moment
[4:46:11] <teflonbilly777> Every stat does fuck with you eventually
[4:46:13] <dinnydanny777> Stick your thumb up your ass and find out :)
[4:46:14] <+illusiveSaint> it's much of a tangent only really a thought i don't think
[4:46:17] <Lancaster_H> fascist?
[4:46:17] <+zepelinnn1> EVERY stat has a bad side woolie, you saw island fucking up
[4:46:20] <andre11dr> In this game, the narrator has feelings about your decisions, that's so awesome man
[4:46:20] <+MrAtheGreat> Just do it
[4:46:21] <+Jeshk0> Do it because Authority says so
[4:46:22] <+zepelinnn1> just satire of extermes
[4:46:22] <+akajaybay> it's honor is dumb
[4:46:23] <%Irridium> honorable people got a stick up their ass I think is the joke
[4:46:24] <SetsuRyuu> yes. Every time you raise a stat too high, it does weird stuff
[4:46:27] <teflonbilly777> I never got it, had too low Authority
[4:46:30] <+MrAtheGreat> reload and watch it at least
[4:46:31] <+OblivionSword1> it's just dum brain thought
[4:46:32] <Lancaster_H> its just a "stick up your ass" joke
[4:46:33] <Mr_Zero5232> Worf cared more about honor than any Kronos born Klingon, and it only cost him everything he ever loved or believed in
[4:46:35] <+nuttbrain> I think it's just funee :)
[4:46:43] <Iza_kku> it makes fun of the whole "sword hand" thing too idk
[4:46:45] <DatAsuna> stick it to the man by sticking it up their ass
[4:46:47] <linSP> I think authority was messing with you
[4:46:48] <+illusiveSaint> it was just just a fun lil thing
[4:46:48] <andre11dr> I didn't do it because i was going hard anarchist
[4:46:51] <teflonbilly777> @Mr_Zero5232 Hey, he banged Dax
[4:46:51] <ingman112> The thought itself carries the joke further
[4:46:51] <Chatterbox1991> It's a Butt Thumb joke wool
[4:46:53] <Johannen> Woolie is pulling some wild conceptualization
[4:47:01] <Iza_kku> i feel like that joke is for specific people but maybe it hits
[4:47:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:47:03] <$arcielardor> RESPECT MAH AUTHORITAH!
[4:47:03] <peyodogo> i never saw it associated to authority, it just appears when you cross a thereshold of honour choices
[4:47:04] <Robot_Nixon_> I considered it more satire or exaggeration of these things
[4:47:05] <+ClericOfSparda> this game tries not to make sense.
[4:47:10] <GarbageNirvana> I want to see a Reggie play through after this
[4:47:11] <UnfilteredComic> I think its like, putting your head up your own ass
[4:47:13] <%Javaa01> It is just intellectual T-posing, by actually fucking yourself
[4:47:13] <+Jeshk0> it does make sense tho. Authority it demanding you do something crazy and you have to prove you're on the same page
[4:47:16] <ingman112> When you finish the thought you get a shitload of Honor Points (useless) and a Suggestion penalty
[4:47:18] <Mr_Zero5232> @teflonbilly777 yeah but he got the sweet booty without it
[4:47:20] <%wolfofsound> menacing aura mug
[4:47:22] <+nuttbrain> I thought it was about putting a finger in the butt
[4:47:25] <%kyh9> It’s very much NOT the fascist skill
[4:47:32] <Ids560> all the political ones give you 4 steps to lead in and honor's lead ins aren't as clear
[4:47:37] <teflonbilly777> All in hard in the butt
[4:47:38] <servicesuspension> the game is never gonna hard judge you for experimenting a little to the point you can't come back. don't get anxious, you ain't gonna become a nazi in one roll
[4:47:47] <%VyperVic> endurance is fascist
[4:47:49] <+illusiveSaint> fascist is endurance
[4:47:49] <DatAsuna> not all in, just a thumb in
[4:47:51] <+MrAtheGreat> @ingman112 You also get a 5 learning cap to honor but a shrug to trhat really
[4:47:57] <Lancaster_H> Endurance/Psyc. instrument
[4:47:57] <andre11dr> Oh the fascist skill will be VERY APPARENT when it shows up
[4:47:59] <naoi0> The game dunks on all political thoughts
[4:48:06] <dinnydanny777> You can be pretty bad without being a fascist limesLurk
[4:48:08] <Ids560> authority chimes in a lot with fascist things but the main one is endurance
[4:48:09] <SomeAsianDood> fascist is physical instr
[4:48:09] <UnfilteredComic> nahhh
[4:48:10] <%kyh9> Nope
[4:48:11] <+OblivionSword1> oh you'll know if it is fascist
[4:48:12] <gecomaman> You don’t understand de corp then, it’s great
[4:48:12] <ingman112> Esprit is more about brotherhood
[4:48:13] <+MrAtheGreat> Good thought, but Fascist is another stat
[4:48:13] <Johannen> nope
[4:48:14] <+Jeshk0> Authority is both having and respecting authority
[4:48:21] <servicesuspension> fascist is endurance, because it's about being STRONG
[4:48:22] <+zepelinnn1> are your stats that high? then its not extreme
[4:48:25] <yomamma133713> Endurance is worse
[4:48:27] <librettodude> The game wants you to fuck up a little; It's very forgiving of mistakes in low-stakes situations
[4:48:29] <%kyh9> Fascists want to pummel your head in, what skill is helpful for hurting people?
[4:48:31] <iacus_> it dunks on some less fairly than others (the game isn't centris it that way and also biased/tyrannical)
[4:48:32] <gecomaman> De corp is your “understand Kim” stat
[4:48:37] <teflonbilly777> Endurance and Physical acted more fascist than Authority to me
[4:48:38] <+OblivionSword1> you'll know if it is fascist
[4:48:39] <andre11dr> Endurance was the one that gave me fascism
[4:48:42] <ingman112> Perhaps we'll see!
[4:48:44] <+OblivionSword1> it is verry clear
[4:48:46] <Robot_Nixon_> electro chem is the only important stat Kappa
[4:48:48] <dauver> stats are really not that politically alligned, you make dialogue choices for that
[4:48:50] <dinnydanny777> Authority means respecting other people's authority too? limesYikes
[4:48:52] <+MrAtheGreat> TBF you don't have a grip on all the thoughts personalities
[4:48:54] <%VyperVic> you'll get there.
[4:48:55] <peyodogo> imperfect playthroughs are how its meant to happen
[4:48:57] <%kyh9> Physical instrument is cool thi
[4:49:00] <GarbageNirvana> you also have a brain of your own you can use you know
[4:49:01] <Ids560> esprit sometimes does the shivers thing but specifically for cop stuff
[4:49:01] <pi_in_the_sci> There a re a bunch of Fascist skills, at least one per stat
[4:49:05] <+Hayajin_> 11
[4:49:13] <Johannen> Woolie is just imagining SouthPark Cartman AUthorate
[4:49:15] <servicesuspension> @iacus_ that's what happens when the writers have actual beliefs about the real world
[4:49:22] <Asuterisuku> So Guilty Gear this weekend!

[4:49:49] <andre11dr> Not again
[4:49:56] <%Mathochism> Megalomania is a grab, yeah.
[4:49:59] <Asuterisuku> It projectiles on whiff.
[4:50:02] <+OblivionSword1> fook
[4:50:42] <+OblivionSword1> speaking of fingers
[4:50:42] <andre11dr> Hopefully she's low life like the other games
[4:50:46] <he1lhydra> c805ThinkChatThink
[4:50:58] <Asuterisuku> Her air super being 632146 instead of 2363214 is weird. I don't hate it but it means you can't TK it anymore.
[4:51:04] <andre11dr> But i might play her ,she looks really cool
[4:51:12] <+MrAtheGreat> Why it was actually a really greta one
[4:51:17] <yomamma133713> guess you should keep playing *shrug*
[4:51:19] <+MrAtheGreat> aside from the thumb
[4:51:25] <ToxInjection> Can't say the same for myself LUL
[4:51:27] <peyodogo> thats fine yo, love2fuck up
[4:51:29] <Robot_Nixon_> you can continue Kappa
[4:51:31] <Mundkipz> lose100% of
[4:51:32] <BerryliciousDefinition> Well, I had fun
[4:51:33] <+Jeshk0> Overthinked it
[4:51:34] <+OblivionSword1> it's 28% though
[4:51:35] <servicesuspension> the ghost too
[4:51:36] <balthazar758> woolie defeated
[4:51:36] <Mundkipz> the chances you don't take
[4:51:37] <naoi0> I need to watch this once the live is done
[4:51:38] <Johannen> Well that is the lesson. " Dont Overthink it"
[4:51:39] <linSP> just the tip maybe
[4:51:44] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[4:51:45] <%nicversus> It really all kinda fell apart after the dice
[4:51:47] <teflonbilly777> Should've let the pants drop
[4:51:48] <Blank9> living without honour
[4:51:48] <andre11dr> At least you got to trick the lady
[4:52:01] <Lancaster_H> logic literally saying "dont overthink it" and these results are way too funny to me
[4:52:01] <naoi0> Well the fails are also conent
[4:52:02] <dinnydanny777> Should have sticked your thumb up your ass? limesThink
[4:52:04] <naoi0> "You're black"
[4:52:05] <gecomaman> The commenters who said “don’t reload” suuuuuck
[4:52:09] <+MrAtheGreat> The dice is NOT a big deal @WoolieVersus It only gives a +1 modifier to two of about 40 skill checks. You're fine on thaty.
[4:52:13] <%kyh9> USE THE TWITCH INTEGRATION
[4:52:14] <andre11dr> I had a,2,in int and could trick her
[4:52:16] <+ClericOfSparda> The payoffs get better later
[4:52:16] <naoi0> Some moments though are very much worth save scumming
[4:52:17] <servicesuspension> yeah, do the crazy
[4:52:22] <Johannen> Dice was not a big thing
[4:52:25] <yomamma133713> Im down for twitch integtation
[4:52:34] <%kyh9> Dice isn’t that important
[4:52:34] <+purps26> you didn't miss any big stuff
[4:52:34] <naoi0> Yeah turn on integration
[4:52:42] <teflonbilly777> You are on Tuesday. So much content
[4:52:46] <+OblivionSword1> he'll never do the twitch integration chat
[4:52:47] <Blank9> just reload if you're not replaying the game
[4:52:48] <servicesuspension> remember this game has a million words, there's content for days
[4:52:48] <Mr_Zero5232> If you’re not outta control, you’re not in control

[4:53:10] <Ids560> if the content makes you uncomfortable you don't have to do it
[4:53:10] <DatAsuna> when ya dodge content, you dodge content
[4:53:11] <+MrAtheGreat> This game is desgined for failure. Do it and fail and have fun
[4:53:14] <heemwizard> @servicesuspension you will soon enough
[4:53:22] <andre11dr> There is also the password you need to get
[4:53:24] <peyodogo> just do as you will
[4:53:24] <%gatorafan> tbh solving the murder mystery itself feels good enough to me, but that's just me daedra1DerpyTibs
[4:53:27] <+MrAtheGreat> You will never be able to tell which check will or won't screw you
[4:53:28] <%kyh9> Let failures fail.  Live with your life.
[4:53:38] <Lancaster_H> CENTRIST CONTENT
[4:53:39] <%kyh9> It gets better as you level up
[4:53:40] <DatAsuna> just a little weirdness as a treat
[4:53:52] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @servicesuspension
[4:53:55] <Robot_Nixon_> time to strip :)
[4:53:56] <Ids560> "Wholesome"
[4:53:58] <teflonbilly777> Make fuck
[4:54:00] <Blank9> was it really wholesome to smash into a wheelchair lady
[4:54:01] <+illusiveSaint> just focus on the story let the fails run on it's own and there's plenty of content
[4:54:01] <+purps26> you're doing fine.
[4:54:01] <+MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus You really, REALLY want to get that shivers check
[4:54:02] <yomamma133713> wouldnt have been nice if you ended up hurting her lol
[4:54:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:54:03] <%kyh9> You’re not going to get more palatable content at your pace
[4:54:11] <naoi0> Do sweeties get money?
[4:54:16] <DatAsuna> I'm just saying, the deuces probably wouldn't make a "best of" cut for me. lol
[4:54:22] <%kyh9> You got the second chance, to HONOR thyself
[4:54:24] <Asuterisuku> I wanna stroke the big tree.
[4:54:25] <iacus_> not much involves actual criminal stuff. that's typically a game over
[4:54:36] <Johannen> "Wholesome" lets hustle the old lady for some money and her precious stuff
[4:54:46] <DatAsuna> o7
[4:54:49] <Asuterisuku> ... Hey, what happens if you actually hit Cunoesse?
