[0:10:54] <enerkaizer> people are already uploading all the arcade endings
[0:10:58] <leith_aziz> PC is always superior because mods

[0:16:06] <%Juriasu> Minh later in the editor room: "wait how many times did he move it?!"
[0:16:11] <+MagiKestral> reminder that if you want to support the dev, you can buy their previous game at any price

[0:18:31] <Lavrohas> *dif
[0:18:40] <%bruuzer12> @juriasu You can find a witch hat in the newest versions. Some people think it's a Zullie reference, others say it's the developer, since she's into witch stuff
[0:18:53] <%bruuzer12> I like to think it's both
[0:18:54] <%arkv01> probably a little of both
[0:19:10] <%Juriasu> @bruuzer12 I see it's cool either way
[0:19:10] <+dj_berserk_ix> Wow there's new content?

[0:36:15] <Lavrohas> genius
[0:36:35] <%Feralspirit41> That should be a future cheat. Change what the winter lanterns say
[0:36:51] <Lavrohas> sewr gave me silent hill 1 sewer vibe. the split layout.
[0:36:59] <%holydeviant1> @Feralspirit41 "gimme twenny dollars, gimme twenty dollars"
[0:37:04] <%bruuzer12> @Feralspirit41 Would probably need certain options, but that would be fun
[0:37:11] <%JohnAtDawn> Does anyone know where the game ends? I tried to look up the last fight and couldn’t find it.
[0:37:20] <%Feralspirit41> @holydeviant1 weve been trying to reach you regarding your cars extended warranty

[0:41:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> In PS4 Bloodborne they can knock you out of the warping animation and cancel it
[0:41:36] <karawra> mash mash
[0:41:38] <Lavrohas> @woolieversus careful mashing on lanterns woolie you can get softlocked
[0:41:47] <+MagiKestral> ok just did the open door thing at the beginning of the game. Not as cool as I thought it would be but I liked it lol
[0:41:49] <%Feralspirit41> they can also cancel the animation in this

[0:44:51] <enerkaizer> question: why can't woolie kill this enemy?
[0:45:01] <%bruuzer12> @enerkaizer Because pain
[0:45:04] <Lavrohas> by design
[0:45:15] <Boegame> unkillable
[0:45:18] <Lavrohas> because they are more terrifying now
[0:45:21] <enerkaizer> ah, okay
[0:45:31] <%holydeviant1> Frenzy is a bitch, is the real answer
[0:45:31] <%parazoa42> @enerkaizer because they have absurd health and an insta-kill attack. It's designed to be a horror kind of thing.
[0:45:37] <linSP> Who’s idea was to bring winter lanterns out of the dream
[0:45:46] <enerkaizer> thx to everyone who answered :)
[0:46:09] <andre11dr> 8 shots, more than enough to kill everything that moves
[0:46:19] <Lavrohas> uh
[0:46:28] <Lavrohas> thata not supposed to happen
[0:46:28] <%Shishi1205> I've never seen this
[0:46:29] <%holydeviant1> You gotta kill one eventually, woolz
[0:46:32] <%Feralspirit41> HA
[0:46:32] <Lavrohas> thats a bug
[0:46:41] <BlackermanZX> LMAO
[0:46:47] <%bruuzer12> Oof that bug
[0:46:48] <%Feralspirit41> Hes not supposed to be in there
[0:46:48] <+MagiKestral> yeah she's not meant to be in there. Sucks that they tracked inside
[0:46:53] <Lavrohas> you bugged it by zoning out earlier i think
[0:47:00] <%holydeviant1> fr that was a bug?
[0:47:06] <shibarks> hearing her song in the base game is immediately anxiety inducing
[0:47:09] <%Feralspirit41> oh yeah
[0:47:12] <BlackermanZX> you might wanna restart
[0:47:12] <%Feralspirit41> that was a bug
[0:47:14] <Jaysky> STOP BUG TESTING
[0:47:19] <%bruuzer12> Yeah, that ain't supposed to happen
[0:47:20] <WanderingYoren> lalala la "ya know lets talk to some NPCs
[0:47:22] <+vaderxyz1970> what's that smell
[0:47:24] <Lavrohas> @woolieversus zone in and out ans you can have a lantern not spawn
[0:47:24] <linSP> wait until reggie sees how good they look like in hd
[0:47:25] <%Namillus> Apparently mashing the lanterns bugs the game out and you did it twice lmao
[0:47:26] <%holydeviant1> @Jaysky HE'S TOO STRONG
[0:47:28] <+Byr0nX> stop qa'ing
[0:47:30] <WanderingYoren> lets check that inventory
[0:47:41] <RainSandDew> Gibert's Estate is the path forward, so...
[0:47:43] <+MagiKestral> did anyone else main the double barrel in this. Satisfying

[0:47:54] <%Feralspirit41> i did after i got it
[0:47:58] <%Feralspirit41> super useful
[0:48:06] <Lavrohas> @woolieversus  use what you need now. this is final stretch
[0:48:15] <%bruuzer12> If you have the bullets, its super good
[0:48:32] <%Feralspirit41> in B4 hes there again

[0:51:08] <Lavrohas> the system seems to try to follow you through zones aftee you aggro one.
[0:51:08] <glorioushedonist> central yamcha
[0:51:22] <VincentGraves> wait what's going on
[0:51:38] <Lavrohas> it may technically be the lantern that spawned in the house trying to follow you into next zone aftee ypu grabbed its aggro

[1:01:20] <happy_void> yea he ends up a regular beast you can kill
[1:01:26] <%arkv01> blud?
[1:01:41] <%bruuzer12> Many bluds
[1:01:42] <Lavrohas> THATS supposed to happen. scripted
[1:01:42] <%Feralspirit41> bluuuuud
[1:01:46] <%Shishi1205> thats the intended one
[1:01:52] <BlackermanZX> NOW its time
[1:01:53] <%Feralspirit41> so this one is supposed to be here
[1:02:09] <CappuccinoGuil> Can you not kill the lanterns in this? I'm not sure
[1:02:14] <%Feralspirit41> nope
[1:02:18] <andre11dr> Nope
[1:02:18] <%Feralspirit41> theyre invincible
[1:02:21] <Lavrohas> theres a way to kill this lantern
[1:02:26] <Lavrohas> thats all ill say
[1:02:28] <glorioushedonist> the hell is happening?
[1:02:30] <%mr_sups> la la-laaaa
[1:02:37] <+DoktorZee> i think the dog bit you out of it
[1:02:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:02:37] <%holydeviant1> interrupted his own visceral lol
[1:02:42] <%The_Timo> got canceled by doggo
[1:02:49] <%X2Eliah> This does not feel like Dark Souls anymore
[1:02:50] <%Feralspirit41> doggo cancel
[1:03:00] <glorioushedonist> no johns
[1:03:18] <andre11dr> The lantern in this version....it's a cool idea but i don't think it's a fun idea
[1:03:23] <snakemuho> no iframes on ps1
[1:03:30] <+dj_berserk_ix> You thought hggShh
[1:03:31] <Lavrohas> i think its great
[1:03:32] <Jaysky> What the dog doin?
[1:03:36] <%holydeviant1> @snakemuho Really?
[1:03:43] <+MagiKestral> I think the lantern works but it does suck that woolie can't read lore because he decided to go a different path
[1:03:47] <snakemuho> the tech wasn't invented yet
[1:03:59] <andre11dr> But then again i always thought the lantern was the worst enemy in the whole game
[1:04:19] <Lavrohas> she broke in
[1:04:23] <%holydeviant1> @andre11dr Considering there was a whole ass zone of Frenzy Bullshit in the original
[1:04:23] <andre11dr> Maybe except for the Chainhurst crow
[1:04:24] <VincentGraves> nah the shark duo is the worst
[1:04:47] <BlackermanZX> shoulda read when you had the chance
[1:04:50] <+MagiKestral> shoutout to the lantern
[1:04:53] <Lavrohas> the lantern broke in
[1:05:05] <andre11dr> Oh yeah i forgot about shark fuck cave
[1:05:05] <%Feralspirit41> the green lantern even
[1:05:18] <%bruuzer12> Shark fuck cave is the worst imo
[1:05:27] <Lavrohas> you have Plenty of time to read the notes as long as you dont alert the lantern
[1:05:46] <%bruuzer12> Like, universally agreed upon that its easier to cheese with Shaman knives
[1:05:57] <Lavrohas> lantern goes on a patrol route or follows you if alerted
[1:06:01] <enerkaizer> Fun Fact: There is a fusion character of prof. X and Dr. Strange called "Dr. Strangefate". yes, that's real
[1:06:36] <Awesome_Leaf> can he not kill the lanterns?
[1:06:42] <%bruuzer12> Nope
[1:06:44] <%Feralspirit41> Lanterns are invinvible
[1:06:46] <Awesome_Leaf> dang
[1:06:50] <%Feralspirit41> invincible*
[1:06:51] <Lavrohas> except for this one
[1:07:03] <BlackermanZX> oh no LUL
[1:07:04] <Jaysky> Lanterns shine too brightly in this game
[1:07:07] <Lavrohas> special option for this one
[1:07:10] <Awesome_Leaf> thats messed up lol
[1:07:20] <Jaysky> They become unstoppable
[1:07:29] <glorioushedonist> is Woolie lost?
[1:07:40] <%Shishi1205> Ogre has the second door behind him
[1:07:42] <Jaysky> Aren't we all?
[1:07:50] <Ziegsy> @Awesome_Leaf does it involve the chandelier the camera seems to love?
[1:07:51] <Lavrohas> courtyard had a staircase
[1:08:03] <andre11dr> Isn't everyone lost?
[1:08:06] <%CodenameChaz> "Is it safe"
[1:08:24] <xerotwo> are those fuckers hard to kill?
[1:08:40] <+DoktorZee> UNPLAYABLE lmao

[1:19:55] <a_mad_dragon_> psaBig StinkyCheese
[1:20:05] <andre11dr> Woolie playing like a real Souls expert
[1:20:07] <boof_abroad> StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese
[1:20:25] <rasamune> Is this song original? I don’t recognize it
[1:20:27] <%bruuzer12> I love the detail that he's wearing the Outsider's Garb you start the game with
[1:20:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> nothing
[1:20:31] <andre11dr> StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese
[1:20:32] <+DoktorZee> yes its an original song
[1:20:33] <%Shishi1205> when he goes into a bloodfrenzy he can one shot you with a combo
[1:20:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> @rasamune original, yes
[1:20:34] <%Feralspirit41> Mom said its my turn to play on the playstation
[1:20:39] <%CodenameChaz> Calm down kids, if you're upset ath is play style, play the game yourself
[1:20:43] <rasamune> Nice
[1:20:46] <Lavrohas> the song is original yes. look up the noble demon bbpsz on youtube, they postes all the tracks they did
[1:20:49] <+TopTieramisu> is it just me or was this boss not designed like a bloodborne boss?
[1:20:52] <Lavrohas> *bbpsx
[1:20:53] <Awesome_Leaf> time for cheese
[1:20:53] <%Shishi1205> Now this is the cheese
[1:20:58] <wqorst> ???
[1:20:59] <%bruuzer12> @TopTieramisu Just you
[1:21:00] <Sapphire_Breeze> yeyeye
[1:21:00] <CappuccinoGuil> GRABBED
[1:21:01] <+polothegreatest> plaguePog plaguePog plaguePog
[1:21:04] <BlackermanZX> COMMAND GRAB
[1:21:07] <+DoktorZee> he lets you go
[1:21:11] <+MagiKestral> he recognized you and couldn't do it!
[1:21:11] <nutimik> he drops you automatically
[1:21:11] <%CavemanInCave> he said no no no no no *finger wag*
[1:21:12] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheyCallMeVawn
[1:21:12] <Lavrohas> he grabs but cant bear to hurt you so he falls to the ground @woolieversus
[1:21:14] <%Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus When he grabs you he realizes who you are and he lets you go
[1:21:16] <+Byr0nX> playin fences
[1:21:19] <%JohnAtDawn> YOU THOUGHT
[1:21:19] <%parazoa42> @TopTieramisu it's designed like a human boss, not a beast. It's doing Maria dashes.
[1:21:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Gilbert: *grabs hunter* Hunter: Harder~
[1:21:24] <boof_abroad> he let you go cause he's a good boy
[1:21:34] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu most bloodborne bosses incentivize you to stay on the boss and go toe to toe. this incentivizes you to pick your shots and back out, like a ds1 boss
[1:21:46] <andre11dr> I thought that was a bug the first time it happened
[1:21:58] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu even maria incentivizes you to go in on her
[1:22:04] <%Feralspirit41> Come to think of it i dont think i was ever grabbed when i fought him
[1:22:13] <+capybruhArt> can anyone think of a ps1 boss that moves like this? whenever i see this fight i get a weird sense of uncanniness
[1:22:19] <andre11dr> First try, really?
[1:22:36] <nutimik> he's not that hard tbf
[1:22:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> he did it
[1:22:40] <+TopTieramisu> good stuff
[1:22:40] <enerkaizer> stair tech gives woolie the win on attempt 1 xD
[1:22:41] <xerotwo> YEYEYEYEYE

[1:22:42] <%mr_sups> 1st TRY!
[1:22:43] <BlackermanZX> the fact that he grabs you and recognizes you is sick
[1:22:45] <karawra> Nice

[1:22:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> aw

[1:22:58] <teefpal> Noice
[1:22:59] <nutimik> yeah I fuckin love this boss
[1:22:59] <Lavrohas> @woolieversus would you like to know what the true ending is and how its achieved? you misses it but its not a big deal at all.
[1:23:01] <CappuccinoGuil> Love the way he stops and falls over
[1:23:03] <waltzqueen> xscottyGG xscottyGG xscottyGG
[1:23:03] <%parazoa42> This fight took me several tries, gg
[1:23:07] <Sapphire_Breeze> gg
[1:23:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie killing innocents SMH
[1:23:09] <+K4TL0N> oh shit is Reggie cosplaying
[1:23:20] <%Feralspirit41> how did he tie down his second arm
[1:23:45] <boof_abroad> he probably put his hands in loosely, but beefed up in beast mode
[1:23:45] <andre11dr> It took me 2 tries, he's not that hard, very easy to cheese
[1:23:46] <Awesome_Leaf> lol good question
[1:23:55] <%Shishi1205> @Lavrohas I don't think I got the true ending
[1:23:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:24:40] <+MagiKestral> I made sure to give the dev 20 bucks for this through their previous game they made
[1:24:44] <Lavrohas> you need 20 insight to get rue insight, where you need to kill that winter lantern with the chandelier when it patrols under it.
[1:24:45] <%CavemanInCave> we need more
[1:24:46] <$guiltyboya> Amazing game

[1:25:13] <FrostedZaibatsu> The Blue Point of demakes
[1:25:15] <%livlinn> !uptime
[1:25:15] <+MagiKestral> @Lavrohas yo that's sick. Any video you've seen of it?
[1:25:16] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 44 minutes

[1:25:19] <%bruuzer12> OKay thats sick
[1:25:19] <%CodenameChaz> Setup stinger for a possible sequel too.
[1:25:19] <%Shishi1205> that makes sense
[1:25:19] <%mr_sups> I can't wait to see what else she does.
[1:25:32] <%Feralspirit41> dark souls demake when
[1:25:37] <Hammatime8> A BRAND NEW BOSS? Fucking WILD, man
[1:25:48] <Lavrohas> go look up LilithWalthers youtube no commentary full LP, she recorded it all ans how to get true end
[1:26:04] <andre11dr> I wonder if she'll make more
[1:26:07] <+pupil31> SourPls
[1:26:09] <Jaysky> They added something of their own
[1:26:10] <Lavrohas> she has cool stuff planned
[1:26:17] <nutimik> the chandeliers are used to kill the Winter Lanterns btw
[1:26:19] <andre11dr> Like with the latter areas
[1:26:20] <%Feralspirit41> Ah the music box
[1:26:28] <Jaysky> AND it was comparable
[1:26:29] <+TopTieramisu> does she plan to demake later parts of bloodborne?
[1:26:38] <+MagiKestral> @Lavrohas many thanks for the YT reccomendation
[1:26:39] <Lavrohas> no that will be other fan worm
[1:26:42] <Lavrohas> *work
[1:26:48] <nutimik> @TopTieramisu probably not
[1:26:59] <leith_aziz> Hi again
[1:26:59] <OblivionSword1> even mr x in the original RE2 was not actually  persistent
[1:27:00] <Lavrohas> at some point the source code will be releaaws and other peoplw can pick it up
[1:27:06] <nutimik> she's planning to work on other stuff after the split-screen update
[1:27:08] <Lavrohas> *released
[1:27:09] <andre11dr> I think some bosses would murder the framerate in this style
[1:27:11] <%bruuzer12> So far, no word on if she's planning on doing more of the game
[1:27:14] <leith_aziz> Seems we finished the game. Hope you enjoyed it pickyEZ
[1:27:16] <357Sneak> lytCLAP
[1:27:20] <+eanscrale> Just as Miyazaki would've done
[1:27:29] <%bruuzer12> But some extra stuff, like coop, is coming
[1:27:31] <andre11dr> Like think of Paarl in this style
[1:27:32] <leith_aziz> Kudos on the project pickyFive1 pickyFive2
[1:27:53] <Lavrohas> @woolieversus do you want to know what and how true ending is achieved
[1:27:54] <Aydarkzero> yep
[1:27:54] <%Namillus> Co-op!? what
[1:27:57] <leith_aziz> pickyLove
[1:28:00] <lymund> would love to see an original project where she took what she learned from this one, so talented
[1:28:07] <leith_aziz> Oh yeah, that's true
[1:28:08] <+MagiKestral> I don't want someone tied down to a free project based on someone else's work, but I would want to see more PSX themed things
[1:28:10] <$guiltyboya> SPOILS
[1:28:16] <%bruuzer12> @Namillus Yup, thats what she's working on right now
[1:28:17] <%Th3rd3> close your eyes Reggie
[1:28:19] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Ymfah didn't need the shotgun to make a BB gun-only playthrough. LUL
[1:28:22] <%Feralspirit41> Yeah id look away
[1:28:23] <leith_aziz> I do respect them crediting the full game
[1:28:23] <+TopTieramisu> Paul Borne
[1:28:23] <@Menitta> My favorite boss. Voice Recording Engineer.
[1:28:28] <+TopTieramisu> there's a dude named Paul Borne
[1:28:28] <+pupil31> Cover his eyes Woolie
[1:28:28] <leith_aziz> That's a nice touch
[1:28:38] <+TopTieramisu> in the credits
[1:28:40] <andre11dr> Ariana Kreygasm
[1:28:55] <%Namillus> @Sonny_Firestorm Did need a double-barreled gun tho
[1:28:59] <%Feralspirit41> Reggie go back to pondering your orb during the credits
[1:29:01] <leith_aziz> Patches? cohhM
[1:29:06] <%bruuzer12> Zullie is still locked
[1:29:09] <%Shishi1205> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMUNczGAYfo Dev walkthrough btw
[1:29:23] <%CavemanInCave> BB lp coming soon kekw
[1:29:26] <+MagiKestral> dev playthrough gets the 20 insight needed for a secret, but its literally split second lol
[1:29:30] <%mr_sups> So are we doing Reggie VS Dark Souls 2 or Reggie VS Bloodborne first at this point?
[1:29:36] <BlackermanZX> YET
[1:29:41] <%bruuzer12> @mr_sups I would guess DS2
[1:29:43] <+TopTieramisu> ds2 would take a looooong time
[1:29:45] <Sapphire_Breeze> for now
[1:29:46] <megaman_sentinel> man that bloodborne LP going 2 b insane
[1:29:50] <Aydarkzero> lmao
[1:29:50] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Sonny_Firestorm Not really, you can replace the repeater pistol for the Evelyn.
[1:29:50] <leith_aziz> doodSad
[1:29:53] <leith_aziz> F*CK
[1:30:00] <Sapphire_Breeze> you get nothing, good day sir
[1:30:00] <Lavrohas> i hope ds 2 first for his sake or ds2 will give him whiplash in the bad way
[1:30:06] <leith_aziz> Rub salt in the wound
[1:30:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reminder Sony killed Japan Studio
[1:30:09] <VincentGraves> :(
[1:30:11] <+mechslayer71> They're DETERMINED to keep that shit pseudo fugly
[1:30:11] <LoneFonte> Breaking news: there is no news.
[1:30:11] <+Byr0nX> this is it, NO
[1:30:13] <andre11dr> Today in Bloodborne knews NOTHING
[1:30:13] <T_Sasquatch> It REALLY doesn't makw sense
[1:30:14] <lymund> FeelsBadMan
[1:30:27] <Aydarkzero> tripleDANKING
[1:30:27] <leith_aziz> This game will never get ported
[1:30:28] <%bruuzer12> This is crimes
[1:30:28] <+eanscrale> Hope? more like COPE
[1:30:31] <$Rafraud> They're too busy fixing DS online Kappa
[1:30:32] <%Shishi1205> @MagiKestral 3 frames lmao I counted
[1:30:33] <357Sneak> zyzxYoink  zoneGlare yapicoNO
[1:30:33] <Sonny_Firestorm> There is no war in Ba Sing Sei
[1:30:33] <jorniev> NEVER
[1:30:35] <+JustToWatch> NEVER
[1:30:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:30:40] <%RyTYoung> Bloodborne is the new Mother 3 NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:30:44] <HarshNerf> wait for the ps6 sucka LUL
[1:30:45] <@Solidus_113> It feels like a Demon's Souls situation, but way worse because Bloodborne is an absolute darling
[1:30:45] <+TopTieramisu> fromsoft is usually not that involved with remakes/remasters. that's usually on the other party, and sony ain't doing shit
[1:30:47] <jorniev> NEVER EVER EVER
[1:30:52] <@Menitta> I think that was A. just a rumor and B. Fromsoft wouldn't do it themselves
[1:30:58] <%mr_sups> @RyTYoung WutFace WutFace
[1:30:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:31:02] <%bruuzer12> Bloodborne will never get new stuff, outside of stuff like this demake
[1:31:02] <+eanscrale> I'm sure it'll be amazing in 60fps on the ps7
[1:31:03] <Aydarkzero> buy Bloodborne more Kappa
[1:31:05] <Ipsenscastle> I don't know why people think it'll happen, PS/PC ports only happen when there's a sequel to sell, or the franchise isn't considered valuable enough as an ongoing concern like Days Gone
[1:31:05] <+DatAsuna> That's me
[1:31:05] <nutimik> I would muuuch rather have had a Bloodborne port than Demon's. At least I can emulate DeS
[1:31:18] <leith_aziz> Sure. Best to not leave them in the past.
[1:31:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Bloodborne and XenoChronicles X, forever trapped to their launch hardware FeelsBadMan
[1:31:23] <+polothegreatest> Bluborne is PS Mother3 plagueLUL
[1:31:25] <+MagiKestral> sony would absolutely make a bloodborne sequel withotu fromsoft
[1:31:26] <+TopTieramisu> i'm happy the DeS remake exists. it's freaking gorgeous
[1:31:31] <Sapphire_Breeze> that's some hard copium
[1:31:36] <+TopTieramisu> bloodborne still looks good, outside of the framerate
[1:31:37] <%bruuzer12> @MagiKestral They reallsy shouldn't though
[1:31:38] <T_Sasquatch> Ps6
[1:31:40] <HarshNerf> hold your affection hostage for the next console generation LUL
[1:31:41] <+RedKazoo> BB remake on PS6
[1:31:47] <+MagiKestral> they SHOULDN'T but that's why I think they might one day lmao
[1:31:51] <Ipsenscastle> yeah exactly
[1:31:59] <leith_aziz> People would love that ngl
[1:31:59] <brebbabreb> ah shit did I miss the fight
[1:32:00] <Sapphire_Breeze> PSP3 let's go
[1:32:00] <$Rafraud> I wish

[1:32:02] <T_Sasquatch> Psvita2 LUL
[1:32:03] <BlackermanZX> the Pstendo Switch
[1:32:03] <leith_aziz> PSP2 I mean
[1:32:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Can't wait for Bluepoint to fuck up all the cool designs
[1:32:07] <+DatAsuna> rip vita
[1:32:15] <+DatAsuna> vita 2 aka steamdeck
[1:32:21] <+MagiKestral> and fromsoft, rightfully, want to make things they fully own lol
[1:32:25] <%Shishi1205> you can skip this btw
[1:32:38] <enerkaizer> so, what happens in the true ending?
[1:32:41] <+TopTieramisu> @CanadianAnimatorGuy what they did to executioner miralda and her guillotine axe is egregious
[1:32:44] <a_mad_dragon_> Playstation ReVita
[1:32:44] <leith_aziz> That Smell Of The Game. Aaahhh doodOK
[1:32:50] <%Shishi1205> @enerkaizer three frames of new content
[1:32:51] <+polothegreatest> Vita aka persona4 machine LUL
[1:32:55] <%bruuzer12> @enerkaizer Split second difference with lightning anf 20 insight
[1:33:05] <%bruuzer12> *and
[1:33:14] <%bruuzer12> Still a cool add
[1:33:27] <enerkaizer> I should be shocked, but something like this checks out for a true end in the PS1 era LUL
[1:33:31] <Sonny_Firestorm> Reggie vs BB when though?
[1:33:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Sonny_Firestorm in like 3 years
[1:33:49] <+DatAsuna> she went ham, you might say

[1:34:17] <leith_aziz> So is the order gonna be BB to DS3, or DS 1-3 then BB?
[1:34:25] <%bruuzer12> Gold like the Elden Ring
[1:34:30] <Lavrohas> time to chrck out the mash 100 times door?

[1:34:40] <%bruuzer12> NG+ baybeee
[1:34:41] <%jonblnt> More sifu?
[1:34:45] <+TopTieramisu> i definitely recommend BB before DS3
[1:34:49] <nutimik> might change that when the source code is released
[1:34:51] <leith_aziz> More Sifu I guess

[2:25:33] <%jinking79> kof and street fighter Collab happen
[2:25:35] <andre11dr> I'm glad the boar helm became associated with Reggie, nobody ever uses the helmet because it's a rare drop
[2:25:36] <%mr_sups> I stopped at 2 as well
[2:25:36] <+polothegreatest> Amazon doesnt have LOTR rights? woolieYIKES
[2:25:40] <waltzqueen> i dont care anymore
[2:25:40] <penitentpendant> That fanart looks like something from Darkest Dungeon
[2:25:42] <enerkaizer> Peacemaker ended today its first season with a mega banger.
[2:25:42] <%jonblnt> Same
[2:25:42] <FrostedZaibatsu> What!!!!! Its fucking good
[2:25:46] <%Prevot> I stopped at 2
[2:25:47] <teefpal> What is that show?
[2:25:48] <dds333a> @jinking79 imagine that Kappa
[2:25:54] <%andrewofbob> At least they're calling an end when it's not a trainwreck
[2:25:56] <%CavemanInCave> teenagers
[2:25:57] <%mr_sups> A N T H O L O G Y
[2:25:58] <xerotwo> ive stopped at 3
[2:26:01] <CappuccinoGuil> what are we playing next?
[2:26:03] <%jonblnt> Never saw
[2:26:05] <+pauperofthesouth> i stopped after 1. It was a great show if you end there
[2:26:06] <xerotwo> 1 was great
[2:26:07] <teefpal> Stranger Things should have ended at 3
[2:26:13] <Zebroneath> Should have been an anthology
[2:26:13] <andre11dr> I stopped after season 2
[2:26:14] <%parazoa42> I don't hate 2 and 3. But 1 is still far superior.
[2:26:16] <xerotwo> 3 was kinda pushing it
[2:26:22] <enerkaizer> never forget: Thanks to MTG stranger things characters can fight Street fighter characters now
[2:26:23] <+pauperofthesouth> Oh god idea
[2:26:29] <+pauperofthesouth> *good
[2:26:35] <andre11dr> I never saw anything of 3 ,i don't care
[2:26:36] <dds333a> And Fortnite characters LUL
[2:26:40] <%CavemanInCave> ahs it
[2:26:42] <Treasure_Vault> Stranger Things was kind of mid from the get-go. Sticking to the cast doomed it, but it was never gorgeous.
[2:26:43] <%jonblnt> Only seen the first season
[2:26:45] <dds333a> "characters"
[2:26:53] <%mr_sups> SeemsGood
[2:26:53] <teefpal> idk, 3 was OK but I just liked the characters
[2:27:00] <enerkaizer> Ryu is as strong as the main girl from stranger things accoprding to MTG LOOOOOOOL
[2:27:01] <Ipsenscastle> I suspect it was originally intended as an anthology and then the reception to the cast was so good they changed course
[2:27:08] <+crybirb> Stranger things peaked before the final episode of the first season.
[2:27:14] <penitentpendant> Actors: "BUT ME THOOOO!"
[2:27:16] <dds333a> Like Halloween LUL LUL
[2:27:20] <T_Sasquatch> I stopped in season 1 and i never want to see more
[2:27:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:27:29] <%CavemanInCave> but woolie kids on bikes! nostalgia!
[2:27:45] <%mr_sups> American Horror story vibe. Each season has different story. Same cast tho.
[2:27:47] <stardustcrusad3r> milked
[2:27:48] <+vaderxyz1970> It was a good break out show for Joe Keery aka Steve
[2:27:49] <dds333a> @cavemanincave but but STAND BY ME
[2:27:58] <%CavemanInCave> right lol
[2:27:59] <T_Sasquatch> There's a point where it got cringe with the teen drama shit
[2:28:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> I still care, idk what yall are talking about
[2:28:16] <%parazoa42> Season 3 is Russians
[2:28:22] <teefpal> I had no idea Season 3 was this widely hated, I liked it
[2:28:25] <@Menitta> S1 ends on a sequel tease
[2:28:25] <CappuccinoGuil> You did NOT need 5 seasons to tell that story
[2:28:27] <KeiganOfAstora> I care!!
[2:28:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Kojima will watch it
[2:28:36] <%CavemanInCave> the hot mom tho
[2:28:42] <%hax_metatron> The best part of Stranger Things was S1E1 Unironically. Everything else is trash
[2:28:45] <+Kyma1020> That series is nuts
[2:28:48] <FrostedZaibatsu> Season 3 is about the Mindflare controlling people and Russians opening a port to the Upside down
[2:28:48] <teefpal> It DOES need to end though, should have set things up for a finale
[2:28:51] <enerkaizer> The simpsons meanwhile:
[2:29:02] <@Menitta> Should Breaking Bad have ended at 2 like they planned?
[2:29:05] <%robosqueeb> ahs is kinda lame now
[2:29:07] <andre11dr> The Simpsons really should just stop
[2:29:15] <teefpal> American Horror Story has never been good
[2:29:22] <%mr_sups> @Menitta no
[2:29:28] <andre11dr> That should've stopped at season 9
[2:29:39] <FrostedZaibatsu> The characters are super fleshed out
[2:29:39] <enerkaizer> The sad part is they actually did make a finale for the simpsons in case the show wouldn't have survived the writers strike, and it was actually as good as it could be
[2:29:51] <teefpal> @Menitta 2 and 3 had the problem of not knowing how many seasons they had left, 4 onward is toptier TV
[2:29:56] <%Shishi1205> what about futurama
[2:30:03] <%Shishi1205> That thing is a lich at this point
[2:30:04] <dds333a> LUL
[2:30:05] <BlackermanZX> You have to keep milking the dead cow kolFARMERS
[2:30:36] <DapperCadavr> What show they talking about? :0
[2:30:38] <@Menitta> is walking dead still going
[2:30:45] <dds333a> Stranger Things
[2:30:50] <%Shishi1205> Also the kids grow up
[2:30:52] <TheUltracheeese> @Menitta ends this season iirc
[2:30:53] <@Solidus_113> that seems like a lot of work for writers to keep making 'origin' stories or characters. how do you do that and keep it fresh?
[2:30:53] <teefpal> Walking Dead got goodish again in S9
[2:30:58] <%mr_sups> Like Shaggy and Scooby
[2:30:59] <+EXoGesiss> I think Woolie would really like Midnight Mass if he's not been made aware of it already

[2:40:05] <+EightBitVision> I'm about 40hrs+ and just need to beat game at 25... rough but fun
[2:40:14] <dds333a> it's for score multiplier
[2:40:14] <BearSawed> taunt increasess score
[2:40:17] <%andrewofbob> They're meant to react on max multiplier, so that's the outcome

[2:45:47] <andre11dr> You know, this kinda reminds me of what getting perfect runs in Hotline Miami is like, a bunch of memorizing enemies and maps and strategies to never fail
[2:45:50] <spinningchurro> is woolie going for score?
[2:45:59] <%GarryGabagool> GarryGabagool subscribed with Prime. 
[2:46:28] <dds333a> When you've labbed the boss, and do the entire run, I like making it look as cinematic as I can
[2:46:59] <+EightBitVision> score don't matter unless you really those middle 3rd option. i never used it whole game
[2:47:02] <%andrewofbob> @andre11dr You're right, there is a glow in the middle
[2:47:06] <kazadaz> Boots with the glow
[2:47:11] <+RegularCore> High level sifu looks clean

[2:49:23] <dds333a> @gespenstkick I learned that shit in Final Fight
[2:49:27] <+EightBitVision> if you want 20 by stage two.. you gotta minimize fighting
[2:49:41] <gespenstkick> @Th3SmartAlec LUL
[2:49:47] <+machinetoys> are the weapons lowering the points?
[2:49:54] <+Mellowun> I usually block Kick Girls instead of dodge. They always leave an opening.
[2:49:58] <+EightBitVision> getting to stage 2 sean at 20 is bare min
[2:50:30] <SaiyanShoto> I can never beat the club without one death because of those twins before the boss
[2:50:51] <andre11dr> That ace kick is just straight murder
[2:50:53] <technoweird_o> @machinetoys Weapons don't affect points afaik; all about multiplier and enemy value.
[2:50:55] <Justlaxy> it's kinda tricky but the stairs helped me with the twins

[2:51:35] <+EightBitVision> getting a "grip" on throws will give you the cheese advantage

[2:57:54] <%andrewofbob> Age 20 any bonuses?
[2:57:57] <DXLelouch24> also 3 in parry impact is not needed, i beat game with 2
[2:57:59] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:58:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> All good, you got 2/3 parry impact anyway
[2:58:08] <+EightBitVision> i left stage 2 at 21... after they patched i got 20np
[2:58:38] <dds333a> Sick
[2:58:58] <%andrewofbob> It depends on the enemy difficulty
[2:59:09] <+EightBitVision> base is like 30 for basic bitches

[3:00:18] <+sevorai> yeh
[3:00:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Tower 23 is fine honestly
[3:00:28] <%Spankminister> Spankminister subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! I believe
[3:00:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> oh on epic
[3:00:37] <OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus the tower should be enough for the las parry impact
[3:00:38] <teefpal> Go for progression
[3:00:38] <+sevorai> 23 tower is great imo
[3:00:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> I see I just checked steam and din't see it
[3:00:45] <dds333a> EGS only yeah
[3:00:52] <skyshinecrusader> You can do it woolie
[3:00:54] <teefpal> You can go back and perfect later
[3:00:55] <dds333a> So far (???)
[3:00:56] <Overloard> would have been cool if you went for the high score
[3:00:58] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus regardless what Pat said you REALLY dont need 3 parry impact upgrades. i beat it just fine with 2
[3:00:59] <+EightBitVision> keep it up... just in a slump

[3:02:03] <+EightBitVision> 1st prefect run is usually luck tho lol....gd yang glitched on me on my sparing run :(
[3:02:09] <dds333a> Yesterday Woolz bodied the club, but that was just the clean run
[3:02:13] <DXLelouch24> thats whyi got the two parry impact upgrades in the squats and then called it a day

[3:05:32] <%andrewofbob> sworn*
[3:05:47] <%ChoculaUltra> rip
[3:05:47] <+ValHollaYoloson> yup
[3:05:53] <+EightBitVision> shortcut to boss.. gotta just get in that perfect fight practice... extra shrines not needed
[3:05:56] <%Charronia> Restart? SilverStress
[3:06:00] <DXLelouch24> then do better age to lock it in
[3:06:01] <gespenstkick> Nope, gotta do it all
[3:06:05] <+vaderxyz1970> Full restart
[3:06:05] <jetstreamlove_R> bruh the speedruns in these games are insane, just pure unadulterated skill whit a side of cheese!
[3:06:11] <zerointelligence000> yeah honestly the way this game handles restarting levels is really fucky
[3:06:15] <Enyoyable> The cursed timeline
[3:06:15] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus Did warn you about this
[3:06:16] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[3:06:18] <+ValHollaYoloson> New file basically, I had to do the same
[3:06:21] <%ChoculaUltra> the backtracking aspect of this game can often be brutal
[3:06:26] <+EightBitVision> only saves If you keep continuing from where you restart
[3:06:27] <%CavemanInCave> csbeastSetIn
[3:06:27] <DXLelouch24> so now you need to do squats and get those 2 parry impacts
[3:06:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Yeah, they need to fix that
[3:06:37] <OblivionSword1> gotta either do the club perfect or get the last parry impact in the tower
[3:06:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> @DXLelouch24 no, he needs to beat Club I believe
[3:06:52] <jetstreamlove_R> turns out you can easily cheese this boss LUL
[3:06:57] <gespenstkick> Rip Wooleh
[3:07:08] <DXLelouch24> oh then gotta no death club now
[3:07:13] <+EightBitVision> if you restart club... if you want to keep those new shrines you'll have to play next level... can't skip at that point
[3:07:26] <+Jiggisnipe> so he needs to do the club again?
[3:07:38] <%andrewofbob> Might give you the parry build back
[3:07:45] <%ChoculaUltra> that's such a fucking time sink
[3:07:49] <+mechslayer71> the way this works is easily the worst part of this game
[3:08:06] <BlackermanZX> oh thank god
[3:08:11] <DXLelouch24> go forward and all in on hp now?
[3:08:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's super wierd.
[3:08:22] <+EightBitVision> you cant pick and choose different shrines from different levels... gotta be one continous run
[3:08:26] <%ChoculaUltra> I can see why a lot of people bounced off the game just off that system alone
[3:08:26] <T_Sasquatch> @woolieversus ❤
[3:08:31] <OblivionSword1> The tower should get you enough score for the last parry impact if you go the long way
[3:09:00] <Treasure_Vault> Seems like you should be able to hard mode a level to perma unlock any shrines you took.
[3:09:10] <%andrewofbob> Is there still the old quirk were you can't overwrite a build at same age?
[3:09:16] <%ChoculaUltra> hope they add like a roguelike survival mode kind of thing somewhere down the line if they got the resources/time for it
[3:09:26] <DXLelouch24> @andrewofbob yes
[3:09:36] <OblivionSword1> youngest run is considered the priority no ?
[3:09:39] <%EdgarLOLZ> yo thats wack
[3:09:41] <Treasure_Vault> So it only saved your run for the furthest level?
[3:09:46] <Treasure_Vault> That's wack
[3:10:02] <Arqartur0> Sooo... Just finished Vento D' Oro... HOLY SHIT,It's fighting vs Diamond is Unbreakable as best Jojo series!
[3:10:08] <dds333a> Despite the better clear
[3:10:32] <T_Sasquatch> They said theyd patch this dumb shit i think
[3:10:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[3:10:36] <+EightBitVision> you cant edit you shrine build and skipp to a different level.. you have to play them consecutively
[3:10:59] <Arqartur0> will this be a Peaceful Run?
[3:11:07] <dds333a> Nope
[3:11:11] <ExpressNode> Clearturis
[3:11:29] <dds333a> Woolz is just hitting credits, for now
[3:11:35] <Arqartur0> oooh
[3:11:41] <Arqartur0> got late :(
[3:11:48] <%andrewofbob> Because you didn't walk straight in from club?
[3:11:50] <dds333a> No worries
[3:11:54] <skyshinecrusader> big bugs
[3:12:04] <OblivionSword1> I think it still kept run 1 cause it's the same age
[3:12:10] <T_Sasquatch> How did they make it with such a massive oversight
[3:12:25] <%RyTYoung> It’s cool we got chu boo woolieFABRICATION
[3:12:29] <+sevorai> it should've kept config 2 but gave you config 1 since the age was lower is what Im gathering
[3:12:31] <+EightBitVision> if you decide to edit your shrine on club, you have to go to next level to keep it... if you go to tower, you revert back to your old sj
[3:12:37] <%andrewofbob> @T_Sasquatch I guess shrine builds weren't as much of a feature over the aging
[3:12:41] <+EightBitVision> shrine build

[3:15:01] <+RegularCore> Even the receptionist knows kung fu
[3:15:03] <edward0286> @kisukeoboro besides a small bit of xp, a shortcut
[3:15:18] <dds333a> @regularcore it's like Uganda in here
[3:15:28] <+RegularCore> LUL
[3:15:37] <+RegularCore> I remember that video
[3:15:43] <0078thunder> this first part isnt worth it for 1 more shrine
[3:16:18] <Arqartur0> can you Dragon Punch the password?
[3:16:23] <+sevorai> ooooh can you ask that computer guy at the club?
[3:16:32] <jetstreamlove_R> Doing the finisher gives them a percentage of them going Heat mode. So effectively the best way not getting that is not performing finishers on the grunts
[3:16:42] <dds333a> the two pronged attack
[3:16:45] <Eitchann> this game is the future of kung fu panda games megame6Meganotes

[3:29:06] <T_Sasquatch> Self defense classes are a thing LUL
[3:29:16] <genericplebuserr> Martial Arts classes are mandatory in this game LUL

[3:33:16] <+sevorai> I think it's safe to do takedowns when there's elites already present in the group fight?

[3:33:27] <T_Sasquatch> @lucianliminal yup

[3:35:42] <+EightBitVision> more fifteen than not, you'll go out from a donkey punched
[3:35:45] <OblivionSword1> cause the tower only need 5000 for parry impact

[3:35:52] <%pi_in_the_sci> It's based on the level, the museum is high because it's bigger

[3:45:20] <OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus your new run will overwrite the first one if it's the new one is the youngest
[3:45:34] <+TheOlMitcheroo> @Shoryo_Tori Exactly, shrine rewards aren't a "build" they are additions at best

[3:46:57] <+EightBitVision> lobby
[3:46:59] <BlackermanZX> so it should skip you to the cave
[3:47:00] <+AutomatedSquid> Reggie is the origarmi killa
[3:47:08] <%andrewofbob> Theory: the kid was actually 7 when attacked
[3:47:19] <%RyTYoung> At the beginning of the underground @woolieversus
[3:47:51] <+CrimKangaroo> I'd play that David Cage game, @AutomatedSquid
[3:48:31] <jetstreamlove_R> Nah kid was 11, revived turning 12 and trained for 8 rounding up to 20 default
[3:48:40] <OblivionSword1> ah close

[3:49:57] <%Namillus> Ask not that question.
[3:50:16] <+Shoryo_Tori> Yeah, you can jump down from higher up, it saves time, but counts as a death

[3:54:48] <T_Sasquatch> Decent age for the final
[3:54:52] <+AutomatedSquid> that would've taken pat a good hour
[3:54:58] <DXLelouch24> one more level then true ending time
[3:54:58] <%CodenameChaz> Murdered an entire dojo and killed a child

[3:55:52] <OblivionSword1> the botanist name is Fajar
[3:56:01] <BlackermanZX> isnt Mustafar a planet in star wars
[3:56:02] <%Tearonex> Mustafar = Star Wars
[3:56:07] <TheMadDemoknight> Jafar would fuck Sifu up
[3:56:09] <%CodenameChaz> Now just picturing a Disney version of Sifu
[3:56:10] <+sevorai> Mustafar is a planet in SW yeh
[3:56:10] <zhenthrim213> mustafar is a planet in star wars
[3:56:14] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Reggie a big Disney fan?
[3:56:17] <jetstreamlove_R> Killin the child was unnecessary then again a smart villain would kill the vengeful child before he old enough to kill ua LUL
[3:56:18] <%andrewofbob> So the lesson is, don't take a weapon to a kung fu fight, lest it be turned on you
[3:56:27] <OblivionSword1> Fajar = Sunrise
[3:56:30] <dds333a> Mustafar is the insane lava planet that is infinitely cooler in expanded material
[3:56:41] <+Krasmeyts> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid Yeh, he's hype af for Disney Karts!
[3:56:42] <T_Sasquatch> @sevorai more or less mulan with extra steps

[3:57:32] <+EightBitVision> redo with shortcut
[3:57:38] <+Shoryo_Tori> You should go ahead and do Sanctuary
[3:57:42] <+sevorai> 33 is good for level 5 tbh
[3:57:42] <DXLelouch24> get to the final boss, then worry bout the run,
[3:57:44] <henshin2289> We go in morklyFlexleft morklyLUL morklyFlexright
[3:57:52] <DXLelouch24> trust me you aint beatin him easy
[3:57:59] <%pi_in_the_sci> Not straight there, but it misses first shrine

[4:50:48] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:50:49] <mackovoir> Yang directly calls out streamers for not trying hard enough.

[4:50:53] <wqorst> did he just walk up and

[4:51:12] <tolloponik> walk up hard kick
[4:51:23] <tacostarvedbeast> Ken would approve
[4:51:35] <zenith0111> Kratos nodding in the distance
[4:51:38] <Invess> that was kinda sick
[4:51:38] <%ChoculaUltra> oh my god
[4:51:39] <cooldude69xx> @Pugweight Is it any different than a boss immune to a couple status effects in an RPG?
[4:51:55] <FluorescentLB> him being immune to a crutch is not bad design lol
[4:51:58] <dds333a> As you'd expect
[4:52:02] <penitentpendant> @cooldude69xx TBF, this is closer to a boss being immune to Limit Breaks
[4:52:03] <%Namillus> He taught you everything you know - but not everything HE knows.
[4:52:06] <dds333a> Staredown
[4:52:09] <OtakuSnake1> @Pugweight I disagree. Focus moves are a crutch, this boss teaches you how to really play the game. You need to master the pary and dodge system and counteratack quickly
[4:52:15] <BlackermanZX> damn he folding our main girl
[4:52:15] <Dakuu75> -menacingly
[4:52:17] <tolloponik> he beat a new shirt on ya

[4:53:33] <%ChoculaUltra> damn, he said you ain't SHIT without the chain
[4:53:43] <Dakuu75> projecting, much?
[4:53:53] <alexandrecau> no you
[4:53:57] <skagtheprinceofhell> I thought he was going to take the pendant
[4:53:58] <dds333a> LUL
[4:54:01] <HotSauceFiend> I thought he was gonna pilfer that pendant off you
[4:54:03] <HotSauceFiend> Exactly
[4:54:03] <penitentpendant> I mean, if he stole it from you you go back to one life
[4:54:04] <+khalcipher> So are they brothers? ot not?
[4:54:19] <%ChoculaUltra> would losing the pendant de-age the protag? I wonder
[4:54:25] <+DK_MisterFly> Was that a Kung Fu Panda line?
[4:54:26] <justcallmebobplease> @khalcipher Martial arts 'brother'
[4:54:26] <dds333a> He's moving
[4:54:28] <%ChoculaUltra> or would the just like, die
[4:54:29] <Dakuu75> idk, this guy gives off, jealous-uncle vibes to me
[4:54:29] <+Savarro> Yo that sweep is so nasty
[4:54:30] <cooldude69xx> @penitentpendant Fair, lol. I still dont mind it.
[4:54:37] <+EightBitVision> using focus to slow down time messes with my timing
[4:54:49] <+sevorai> he's got his reasons for doing his shit tbh
[4:54:53] <T_Sasquatch> @choculaultra it just means next time they die they wont revive
[4:54:54] <+Jiggisnipe> yea that's I would figure
[4:54:55] <+khalcipher> @khalcipher ah ok, ty
[4:55:00] <+Jiggisnipe> it might screw up timing
[4:55:06] <%ChoculaUltra> @T_Sasquatch ah thats fair
[4:55:16] <Dopamien> calebBoomer ill get you one of these days
[4:55:30] <Dakuu75> years* not days

[4:56:43] <alexandrecau> yang is earth
[4:56:44] <zenith0111> ALL OR NOTHING
[4:56:49] <%andrewofbob> @HotSauceFiend I think a pure martial boss hits the themes perfectly
[4:57:02] <penitentpendant> The True Final Element: MAN
[4:57:05] <+DK_MisterFly> The speed of that low is crazy
[4:57:07] <+Savarro> Yang is such a sick fight
[4:57:11] <Dakuu75> no weapons around the edge of the arena?
[4:57:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> F
[4:57:12] <HotSauceFiend> @andrewofbob agreed ,I was jsut under the assumptionathat all bosses had some element
[4:57:17] <+polothegreatest> F
[4:57:20] <+mechslayer71> nope
[4:57:22] <alexandrecau> as in solid like a rock, fajar is wood

[4:57:26] <OblivionSword1> Yang is for real
[4:57:27] <zenith0111> I love how instant the game over screen comes
[4:57:27] <thunderborn32> i wonder if his words are different if you dont die getting to him
[4:57:30] <dds333a> @alexandrecau Jin Feng is Metal/Earth, no?
[4:57:30] <BlackermanZX> Damn Vergil going crazy
[4:57:33] <DXLelouch24> just wait till true ending fight
[4:57:47] <mackovoir> Can't you parry his signature attack?
[4:57:50] <$thotbane> is that Yang?
[4:57:52] <cooldude69xx> @zenith0111 The game knows you want to get RIGHT the fuck back in lol
[4:57:55] <+mechslayer71> there are no unparryables in this game. glows can be parried
[4:57:56] <dds333a> That was Yang
[4:57:57] <penitentpendant> Now to skip to final boss
[4:58:00] <alexandrecau> jinfeng is just metal
[4:58:02] <MAX116030> Chat is Woolie still have no Idea about normal sweep? Helps A LOT agains kickers

[4:58:47] <hurgablurg> STRUCTURE CHEFS
[4:58:47] <$thotbane> @Jiggisnipe She reception'd at the wrong dojo
[4:58:49] <%VladVandal> better open UP
[4:58:59] <%andrewofbob> Daytime chef, nighttime cage fighter
[4:59:00] <zenith0111> Chefs said WE'RE CLOSED
[4:59:01] <dds333a> throwing around knives LUL
[4:59:03] <$Rafraud> Why would you not simply use a knife as a chef lol
[4:59:06] <morkelebmink> when chefs say it's closed they MEAN IT
[4:59:07] <penitentpendant> I'm honestly surprised none of them have knives
[4:59:07] <+EightBitVision> @dxlelouch24  that's the part where he glitched out for me... he just stopped doing anything and i couldn't do crap to him
[4:59:17] <derap41> yeah that's ever Bruce lee movie
[4:59:17] <spiritdetective1994> ip man 4
[4:59:21] <zanzibarian_hamster> The one with chuck norris
[4:59:23] <@SoushinSen> man, there's always a fighting chef cook in anything Kung Fu related.
[4:59:24] <Hammatime8> It's like that Virtua Fighter guy that's also a chef
[4:59:26] <%Charronia> Chefs getting served
[4:59:29] <Hammatime8> I forgot his name
[4:59:30] <$Rafraud> Knifeless Kitchen
[4:59:31] <zenith0111> Martial Arts films always need a kitchen fight scene
[4:59:32] <%andrewofbob> TBH, chefs have to learn how to handle Karens; this is a good way
[4:59:40] <+EightBitVision> this area is so unnecessary
[4:59:48] <mackovoir> rude
[4:59:49] <Jaysky> OW
[4:59:50] <+EightBitVision> unless you want that shrine lol
[4:59:50] <penitentpendant> On the bright side, since focus doesn't work on the final boss, no point in saving it
[4:59:52] <zenith0111> ROLL ON THE STOVE
[4:59:53] <Jaysky> ON THE BURNER?
[4:59:56] <tolloponik> teenage Dante NO!!!
[4:59:56] <Dakuu75> are there any moves that are like, legit crowd-control? or everything is one-on-on stuff?

[5:00:13] <Jaysky> Woolie don't you be rolling over a heated burner
[5:00:19] <%RyTYoung> I did thank FUCK
[5:00:23] <T_Sasquatch> Anyone remember the RAID fight in the kitchen and the stove
[5:00:31] <OtakuSnake1> All I learned is that many years ago, I was Chinese
[5:00:32] <zenith0111> Small Knife?
[5:00:37] <Hammatime8> Kitchen machete?
[5:00:39] <+mechslayer71> @rytyoung you don't need to save the run you spare on, it just counts
[5:00:53] <$Rafraud> He just stood there
[5:00:54] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[5:00:55] <%andrewofbob> All the shrine upgrades left are worthless against Yang save for that last parry upgrade
[5:00:55] <zenith0111> THATS SUCH SMART DESIGN
[5:00:57] <dds333a> Nice platitude
[5:00:57] <derap41> Says stabbed man
[5:00:57] <penitentpendant> A single STAB
[5:00:59] <+RegularCore> shanked
[5:01:05] <BlackermanZX> SHANKED
[5:01:06] <AngryAsian5> One step. DEATH.
[5:01:16] <%RyTYoung> @mechslayer71 oh I didn’t know that
[5:01:16] <$Rafraud> "What are you going to do? Stab me?"
[5:01:19] <+DK_MisterFly> That was Victor Reznov from CoD black ops
[5:01:22] <+Xx_HD_xX> and his journey ended with a single stab ti the chest
[5:01:24] <brianthe12th> the journey to hell begins with a single stab
[5:01:26] <Dakuu75> oh man, stepped on his foot to make him sit up, then punched him back down. that was rad
[5:01:26] <Hammatime8> Stabbed him RIGHT in the kidney
[5:01:30] <zenith0111> Let him win :(
[5:01:36] <+mechslayer71> it was a bug
[5:01:36] <jetstreamlove_R> what do I say never talk philosophy in front a knife wielding person!
[5:01:49] <SomeDudeDrawing> a bug
[5:01:53] <penitentpendant> Still crestfallen, still alive
[5:01:53] <derap41> guy sitting there like "pls don't stab me pls don't stab me"
[5:01:55] <OblivionSword1> that was a bug Woolie
[5:01:56] <%andrewofbob> QA pwers quelled
[5:01:59] <yukichocomilk> kick his ass anyway
[5:02:05] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie that wasn't bug testing Kappa
[5:02:09] <+EightBitVision> bad assumptions lol
[5:02:09] <dds333a> Fighting on the edge
[5:02:11] <+Dr_DangerPhD> he saw the machete and said nah, I'm good
[5:02:23] <jetstreamlove_R> can get free hp from him
[5:02:30] <dds333a> @dr_dangerphd as you'd expect LUL
[5:02:34] <tolloponik> nritish man?!
[5:02:45] <MAX116030> Somebody tell woolie that kickers have no defends against normal low sweep
[5:02:48] <tolloponik> British*
[5:02:55] <$thotbane> So are you aging due to magic or something?
[5:02:58] <spiritdetective1994> What style are the big guys?
[5:03:02] <+JustToWatch> I always saved the knife for this guy and the pole guy
[5:03:09] <T_Sasquatch> Magic
[5:03:17] <derap41> brick always works
[5:03:19] <@SoushinSen> do the people see you age in real-time, or is that only a game mechanic?
[5:03:30] <penitentpendant> Spamming Renegade Prompt
[5:03:32] <andre11dr> On the stairs, ouch
[5:03:34] <PALWolfOS> It’s a lore thing too
[5:03:45] <T_Sasquatch> They see you revive but they dont comment on age i think
[5:03:47] <+Commander_Warthog> The disrespect
[5:03:53] <dds333a> They comment when the protag gets up, but I'm not sure about the age, Minh
[5:04:00] <spiritdetective1994> @soushinsen They see it in real time
[5:04:01] <Invess> Hero of his own game
[5:04:03] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda weird the on-the-floor-punching animation is the same for every single weapon despite how hard they went with animations everywhere else
[5:04:11] <henshin2289> Shame they gave enemies reaching mawashi but not the player
[5:04:22] <henshin2289> also axe kick
[5:04:28] <zenith0111> @choculaultra The ground pound is the weakest animation of this whole game easily

[5:05:08] <jetstreamlove_R> The Storm aprouching booms in the distance
[5:05:12] <fistynopunches> have they realized Yang just uses the player moveset?
[5:05:23] <penitentpendant> @Dakuu75 I mean, your character keeps dying and coming back
[5:05:43] <+EightBitVision> mashin works to the ignorant
[5:06:04] <mackovoir> da strings!
[5:06:15] <PALWolfOS> “Try harder” SwiftRage

[5:07:31] <dds333a> IPPON
[5:07:42] <Dakuu75> there must be a video of someone doing a no-hit run of this game. That msut be nuts
[5:07:49] <+sevorai> HE"S FOUND IT
[5:07:51] <derap41> Always the balls
[5:07:58] <TheSaltminer> I don't get why this guy seems to go out of his way to be an asshole about the perfectly understandable motive of avenging the father he killed, while pretending to be this great man who heals the sick and broken.
[5:07:58] <penitentpendant> @sevorai The floor?
[5:08:02] <+sevorai> lol
[5:08:08] <T_Sasquatch> You've got him in a rhythm
[5:08:16] <VincentGraves> when is the blindfold run
[5:08:21] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Look familiar?
[5:08:23] <%Double_Tap_That> Wait, is that move he uses to stun you the eyestrike?
[5:08:24] <Hammatime8> Sub-40 so far!
[5:08:26] <jetstreamlove_R> Foolishness Dante! Foolishness!
[5:08:29] <dds333a> Woolz is seeing the lines
[5:08:33] <andre11dr> Now the real fight begins
[5:08:34] <+Rigid_Digidi> 2nd phase doesnt add a whole lot
[5:08:35] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, if anything I was hoping Yang would've been like "yeah, totally killed your pops but I'm still gonna go down fighting"
[5:08:56] <dds333a> Dem dodges
[5:08:58] <PALWolfOS> @thesaltminer Is it really a pretense?
[5:09:06] <$thotbane> Why did he kill your dad?
[5:09:15] <zenith0111> The themes philosophy are very eastern
[5:09:18] <penitentpendant> @thotbane To get magic
[5:09:19] <BlackermanZX> Sifu Vergil going down
[5:09:22] <PALWolfOS> Well to some extent, yeah - funded on drug money
[5:09:26] <$thotbane> @penitentpendant reasonable
[5:09:26] <Invess> @zenith0111 given the ending, VERY
[5:09:28] <alexandrecau> because he wanted magic
[5:09:40] <TheSaltminer> @ChoculaUltra or at least "I do regret that you've lived with such hate in your heart for me. Let me try to help you as well"
[5:09:40] <+sevorai> there's a bit more context after this
[5:09:44] <linSP> so why does virgil sound like a nerdd
[5:09:55] <PALWolfOS> He wanted the dragon scroll Kappa
[5:09:56] <dds333a> @linsp He IS one LUL
[5:10:01] <alexandrecau> and resurrect some people
[5:10:02] <%Namillus> Because Dan Southworth had a cold. Also he is one, yes.
[5:10:05] <zenith0111> @linsp VA had a nasty cold during recording XD
[5:10:16] <andre11dr> @linsp He has a katana, he IS a nerd
[5:10:17] <+FoxLex_> Fighting Yang is just pure aggressively defensive
[5:10:21] <%ChoculaUltra> then again most villains don't really factor in their villainy or at least process it the same way non-villains would

[5:15:00] <jetstreamlove_R> Woolie: Power....I need... more power!
[5:15:01] <%RyTYoung> wooliePOYO
[5:15:03] <xerotwo> GOTTA LAB IT OUT
[5:15:06] <+ghostfaceninja_> so labbing?
[5:15:07] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Woolie is a crazy person
[5:15:09] <mackovoir> Is the Lab sign up? :)
[5:15:10] <Deko_> you win but did you really?
[5:15:13] <+sevorai> FGC mindset, grindset
[5:15:15] <dds333a> So you're still figuring it out, not necessarily trying to win
[5:15:16] <Blank9> no way clutch winning is best winning
[5:15:18] <BlackermanZX> Lab always open folks
[5:15:23] <+EightBitVision> when you're the predator mindset instead of prey...
[5:15:23] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus his moveset is yours so you DO know what hes doling minus a few moves you dont have
[5:15:24] <andre11dr> So this is Woolies mind goblin
[5:15:25] <$Rafraud> Chat is right but Woolie is righter
[5:15:25] <gespenstkick> woolieGLORY
[5:15:26] <+AWKWARDL0SER> It

[5:15:35] <skyshinecrusader> Woolie Goblin
[5:15:38] <%xeromage> where lab sign?
[5:15:39] <BlackermanZX> The Lab goblin if you will
[5:15:45] <xerotwo> Like Monster Hunter and SoulsBorne, gotta learn enemy moves
[5:15:47] <%Namillus> The entire game is lab
[5:15:47] <@Solidus_113> that's a strong mentality to have when playing MMOs at high level too
[5:15:49] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Born to die?
[5:15:50] <%RyTYoung> IF YOU WERE JUST LIKE, WED SOON BE HISTORYYY
[5:15:54] <+Jiggisnipe> honestly the Lab Sign should always be there

[5:16:01] <%andrewofbob> Get the perfect chain in the quiz The Weakest Link, and you win all the money, but you don't know who's the liability in the team
[5:16:04] <jetstreamlove_R> Evolve or Die!!!
[5:16:09] <penitentpendant> TBF, are shrines even worth it at this point? All they give are weapon damage and focus.
[5:16:12] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Weirdly hypnotized by the reflection in Kirby's face
[5:16:15] <DXLelouch24> i mean imo thematically its better to beat him old than young
[5:16:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> just win
[5:16:23] <xbb1024> hello!
[5:16:23] <%DaRoosta89> perfect parries or it doesn't count
[5:16:27] <DXLelouch24> big journey instead of beat him in your teens
[5:16:28] <%Namillus> @andrewofbob If you got a perfect chain there WAS no liability!
[5:16:30] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie wants to Figure It Out
[5:16:38] <+ghostfaceninja_> any news on if this game will get updates/dlc?
[5:16:38] <%Explodincatz> and u cant really lab to well cause of the aging system limits attempts
[5:16:39] <dds333a> @awkwardl0ser every time, man
[5:16:42] <DXLelouch24> old master beats up someone that taught them as a kid
[5:16:47] <jetstreamlove_R> My man NEEDS that frame data
[5:16:49] <zenith0111> @dxlelouch24 Imo old for bad ending young for good ending
[5:16:50] <%andrewofbob> Still need to vote someone off
[5:16:54] <edward0286> The Sasaki Kojiro mentality is what he means
[5:16:54] <andre11dr> Ok next time the whole chat should ge "haha,you free scrub lol" LUL
[5:17:03] <+EightBitVision> he wants to be sifu master but accepts the practice of Mashing smh
[5:17:04] <xbb1024> now we fighting hospitality staff
[5:17:10] <Solvari> zangief chef monkaS
[5:17:13] <%Namillus> Although tbf I don't think I've EVER seen a perfect chain in Weakest Link
[5:17:17] <%ChoculaUltra> "0-45 but it was close" LUL
[5:17:19] <%jinking79> free heal at least
[5:17:27] <teefpal> was that blood, holy shit
[5:17:28] <penitentpendant> I mean, this is the 'normal ending run' it's labbing to get 'the true ending'
[5:17:34] <+sevorai> I understand that thought process
[5:17:48] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus winning here doesnt matter anyways you still have the true end final boss
[5:17:54] <DXLelouch24> so just win
[5:17:57] <+Rigid_Digidi> It's not about the W it's about the grind
[5:17:58] <skagtheprinceofhell> "It is not enough to win, others must LOSE."
[5:18:02] <Dakuu75> I can't think of a positive comment that isn't close to, "you're getting there."
[5:18:18] <+EightBitVision> it's called making milestones.. not every goal needs to be the final perfect goal
[5:18:24] <andre11dr> I feel like Woolie is arguing with nobody right now LUL
[5:18:32] <Dakuu75> @andre11dr yeah
[5:18:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[5:18:34] <+swesterly> @Rigid_Digidi no it's about drive it's about power
[5:18:36] <dds333a> Da God?
[5:18:37] <+fumbles_tho> @andre11dr that's correct
[5:18:38] <%ChoculaUltra> you remember that scene in Kill Bill where she one-inch punched her way out of a coffin? I feel like Sifu is that - the game.
[5:18:43] <+pugszerosugar> Exactly andre
[5:18:43] <+Commander_Warthog> I am the game
[5:18:43] <%Zero_Jacks> the best lesion to learn is, i might go 0-20 but they never got a prefect
[5:18:46] <penitentpendant> @andre11dr He's arguing with his eternal rival: "One Guy"
[5:18:56] <+ValHollaYoloson> The strive for perfection direction of this game is literally made for Woolie
[5:18:59] <edward0286> It’s like people are mad about the club level and mad how hard it is at first. Even so, you take on so much more experience and learning wise the more you go back and fight again.
[5:18:59] <jetstreamlove_R> Woolie just wanna to master the game
[5:19:06] <dds333a> @penitentpendant he is SO powerful
[5:19:10] <teefpal> I guess I'm built different but Im fine with winning
[5:19:12] <Solvari> oh the death count resets if you get revenge?
[5:19:13] <%Namillus> You need to get to the point where it clocks in that you've won even though the boss still has life and is still doin' shit
[5:19:14] <+EightBitVision> i don't want to be congressman, i want to be president! lmao
[5:19:15] <VincentGraves> speedrun?
[5:19:20] <+Xx_HD_xX> The game is too good for a "one & done"
[5:19:25] <penitentpendant> @dds333a And he can wear random people like 'sleeves'! Possessing anyone!
[5:19:25] <mackovoir> vibe check everyone?
[5:19:34] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Why are you assuming there's a third phase?
[5:19:36] <+sevorai> the club is the learning curb that you need
[5:19:36] <thackattack00> Just take the W and come back later
[5:19:37] <%Namillus> To the point where you can literally count out your hits on Orphan of Kos as you deliber them
[5:19:37] <%slipdog> woolie is making the mother of all omelets
[5:19:41] <tuesti> don't wanna be "good enough" i wanna be GOOD
[5:19:45] <+Jiggisnipe> for Woolie it's the journey not the destination
[5:19:47] <%andrewofbob> Kalm
[5:19:51] <+ghostfaceninja_> you wanna be able to look down on Yang's corpse and say "free"
[5:19:52] <dds333a> hit him again LUL
[5:19:54] <henshin2289> Yes really.
[5:19:54] <+Jiggisnipe> now punch him

[5:19:55] <%RyTYoung> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[5:19:59] <andre11dr> Well you need that mindset for true ending anyway
[5:20:00] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[5:20:01] <+pugszerosugar> I’m fine with winning because I don’t feel I would do a new play through after wards. This is not that game
[5:20:07] <+EightBitVision> it's okay to make stepping goals... can't reach perfection so fast
[5:20:10] <%RyTYoung> Never stop finding bugs Woolie
[5:20:10] <Solvari> punch the truth out of him LUL
[5:20:11] <%Charronia> Non-reproducible cirLost
[5:20:11] <dds333a> Seriously, very interesting LUL
[5:20:15] <Arqartur0> it was a good bug, becaue imade him look like a lvl 1 badass
[5:20:17] <andre11dr> He just got pumped that one time
[5:20:22] <$thotbane> Why not just use a gun?
[5:20:23] <VincentGraves> woolie just wants to keep giving people concussions
[5:20:23] <%ChoculaUltra> "nah yeah I'm just gonna chill - good luck with the revenge thing"
[5:20:29] <+Jiggisnipe> good bug
[5:20:30] <mackovoir> wait, so what would his ai moveset be then?
[5:20:35] <DXLelouch24> see all i care is to win,whatever it takes.Also Elden Ring is in 7 days this is NOT the time to master the game. ill do that on hard mode added later
[5:20:35] <%andrewofbob> He was seeking something else: a good fight
[5:20:36] <+sevorai> Pat has the stand "Crazy Talk" and Woolie has the stand "QA-Days"
[5:20:39] <pookam> tas's and Speedruns of this game will be so cool
[5:20:41] <Arqartur0> @thotbane why use a gun when you can just punch?
[5:20:42] <dds333a> His moveset is just a one hit goon,
[5:20:47] <%Double_Tap_That> That dude just decided that run he'd wake up and choose violence.
[5:20:47] <Dakuu75> @sevorai LOL
[5:20:50] <dds333a> He just stood up for no reason
[5:20:56] <$thotbane> @Arqartur0 use a gun to kill all the mooks then kung fu fight the guy you actually want revenge on
[5:20:57] <Solvari> a kick in the balls
[5:21:06] <penitentpendant> @sevorai Does he look like GasQAng?
[5:21:08] <%Namillus> Why not Kung Fu Fight WITH the gun?
[5:21:13] <andre11dr> @sevorai Woolie stand "Sabotage"
[5:21:13] <%Namillus> Equilibrium baybee
[5:21:13] <+swesterly> "q-A days stando power activate: Exterior Collisions!"
[5:21:15] <+fumbles_tho> Spend focus
[5:21:17] <zenith0111> Recheck movelist?
[5:21:17] <+EightBitVision> he was stabbing and cheesing earlier but not with this guy?
[5:21:26] <Arqartur0> @Namillus Why not Pick up. THE GUN?
[5:21:27] <teefpal> Zamn
[5:21:29] <DXLelouch24> like i get woolies mentality because that is EXACTLY what you have to do to beat Yozora in ReMIND
[5:21:32] <DXLelouch24> PERFECTION
[5:21:33] <dds333a> @namillus Gun Kata is too strong
[5:21:35] <+EightBitVision> get the knife and stab his ass
[5:21:36] <Azure_Inc> Watch for that guy's last hit.
[5:21:38] <edward0286> Charge punch?
[5:21:39] <PALWolfOS> @thotbane But then you don’t get the labbing from the mooks and you’ll get clapped
[5:21:44] <teefpal> Get a weapon
[5:21:47] <jetstreamlove_R> Yang echoing beyond the building: You're not worthy as my opponent...
[5:21:54] <penitentpendant> I think there's a knife still downstairs?
[5:22:03] <+EightBitVision> adapt or die
[5:22:05] <$thotbane> @PALWolfOS Yeah i guess. then shoot Yang too
[5:22:05] <spiritdetective1994> high counter
[5:22:08] <teefpal> Dont challenge yourself woolz
[5:22:20] <%ChoculaUltra> the funny thing is you for sure Yang hears all of his goons getting got outside and he's just chillin, waiting.
[5:22:21] <andre11dr> This is all just training for the real perfect run
[5:22:21] <dds333a> Dude, that guy just tanked that shit
[5:22:24] <DXLelouch24> @thotbane you know damn well hes parry the bullets somehow
[5:22:32] <$thotbane> Do these people know they're students of an Evil Dojo? I feel like if  i just joined the local dojo and then found out it was evil i'd leave
[5:22:39] <+sevorai> Woolie is in it for the challenge tho. THat's what he was just trying to convey to those in chat that dont get it
[5:22:44] <%Namillus> Also the attitude of every single one of these guys tells us that Yang's known you were coming since day one
[5:22:51] <dds333a> @thotbane what if you can't l Kappa
[5:22:52] <jetstreamlove_R> This evil dojo is also a hospital
[5:22:53] <%ChoculaUltra> @thotbane "wait a minute, are we the baddies?" LUL
[5:22:55] <penitentpendant> @thotbane It's magic and he uses the magic to save people's lives.
[5:22:57] <zenith0111> @thotbane They think theyre the good guys tho
[5:23:08] <zenith0111> Most "villians" think theyre good
[5:23:22] <penitentpendant> @thotbane So good PR, people just don't ask 'what'd it cost to get the magic'?
[5:23:25] <BlackermanZX> with all this money and they couldnt buy a gun on the black market kolUuRAaAMESsSHI
[5:23:27] <dds333a> In the Art of Self-Defense, that Jesse Eisenberg movie, if you try to leave the dojo, they kill them
[5:23:30] <PALWolfOS> He did something evil in the past, but for good reasons
[5:23:30] <DXLelouch24> @sevorai i mean yea games fun but theres other games coming out i want to play.ill trial by fire it and become a master with hard mode patch later.
[5:23:31] <%Double_Tap_That> Do you get health regain on phase transition?
[5:23:32] <andre11dr> @sevorai But the chat gets it tho ,nobody is like " bro what are you doing playing the game good" LUL
[5:23:33] <%ChoculaUltra> especially when they only see Yang as some medical wonder who's been saving lives and shit
[5:24:07] <PALWolfOS> But MC is basically the sins of the past coming to haunt him even as he tries to do good now
[5:24:13] <+EightBitVision> takes forever... then he picks it up
[5:24:33] <BlackermanZX> the child murder was unnecesary
[5:24:36] <DXLelouch24> besides even if you do win its not like you cant just fight him again in like 5 min
[5:24:37] <$thotbane> @ChoculaUltra do they say why your dad didnt use the magic to heal people?
[5:24:39] <DXLelouch24> cause shortcut
[5:24:46] <$thotbane> (i just walked in sorry i missed all the lore)
[5:24:47] <+Jiggisnipe> @sevorai it's an fgc mindset. Sajam said something similar about not caring about winning if he's not learning or getting better
[5:24:52] <+Shoryo_Tori> He always goes for the slide sweep after jumping bakcwards
[5:24:59] <Solvari> where is your motivation
[5:25:00] <teefpal> Damn this guy is a WALL
[5:25:13] <zenith0111> @thotbane Eastern philosophy about rebirth is suffering and breaking free of the cycle of death
[5:25:15] <+nolawg> loool just throw the stick
[5:25:16] <DXLelouch24> true end is the real gitgud test
[5:25:23] <%Namillus> @ChoculaUltra Standard "order of martial artists protecting the Great Supernatural Power from falling into the Wrong Hands by hiding it away and never speaking of it to anyone save those within the order."
[5:25:25] <$thotbane> @zenith0111 go beyond death even
[5:25:31] <jetstreamlove_R> Woolie doesn't wanna win...he wants complete domination!
[5:25:35] <dds333a> TIGER
[5:25:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:25:49] <%ChoculaUltra> @thotbane not explicitly - a lot more of Yang's motivations are revealed in the endings
[5:25:49] <zenith0111> @thotbane No like straight up erase my existence and soul
[5:25:53] <+EightBitVision> one more? just keep going.... learning is what you want
[5:25:58] <+nolawg> throw more sticks thats wha the game wants
[5:26:02] <Azure_Inc> Most important takeaway from this is watching and learning.
[5:26:04] <@SoushinSen> "Try harder!" Me: "pff, tryhard!"
[5:26:12] <$thotbane> How many healthbars does he  have
[5:26:15] <BlackermanZX> its like robotnik and sonic. woolz wants to prove hes superior kolUuRAaAMESsSHI
[5:26:29] <%andrewofbob> @thotbane That would be a bit of a spoiler
[5:26:36] <penitentpendant> @BlackermanZX So which one was 'Knuckles'?
[5:26:39] <%Namillus> More than you.
[5:26:51] <+sevorai> I personally respect that FGC mindset, it's more in tune with martial arts where its " There's MORE I could be getting out of this"
[5:26:55] <$Rafraud> Caught the chin oof
[5:26:57] <%livlinn> dothmySaiyan
[5:27:01] <zenith0111> Yangs like "I got the life lead jump"
[5:27:02] <cooldude69xx> @penitentpendant The botanist. He was rougher than the rest of them
[5:27:03] <teefpal> Yeah theres no way I could beat this
[5:27:12] <jetstreamlove_R> that combo woolie did is the cheese strat and he doesn't even know it
[5:27:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Git gud scrub" - Yang, probably
[5:27:21] <$Rafraud> That one is laggy af
[5:27:23] <$Rafraud> Free
[5:27:26] <spiritdetective1994> He's beginning to learn
[5:27:27] <+sevorai> there it is
[5:27:29] <+ghostfaceninja_> how funny would it be if he stepped back, squatted and starting yelling DBZ style
[5:27:31] <dds333a> Dodge on em
[5:27:33] <penitentpendant> He's beginning to believe!
[5:27:35] <Azure_Inc> Nice
[5:27:49] <dds333a> Like Max Holloway
[5:27:50] <jetstreamlove_R> he learned the cheese!
[5:27:53] <+nolawg> throw more sticks its the only way
[5:27:56] <$thotbane> After this stage do you go to the top of a skyscraper?
[5:27:58] <andre11dr> Imagine if Yang pulled out a glock , that would surely catch everyone by surprise LUL
[5:28:12] <dds333a> @thotbane to throw him off? LUL
[5:28:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> title drop, roll credits
[5:28:19] <penitentpendant> @andre11dr Phase 4, he says 'I'm not losing!"
[5:28:22] <+sevorai> @andre11dr you mean like it Sekiro when Isshin just shoots you mid fight? lmao
[5:28:25] <$thotbane> @dds333a because that's where kung fu final boss fights are
[5:28:26] <%VladVandal> there can only be one glock saint
[5:28:33] <PALWolfOS> Parry this, you filthy casual @andre11dr
[5:28:53] <dds333a> @thotbane pretty much, if you see it happen somewhere high, somebody is falling
[5:28:53] <%ChoculaUltra> "I'm out of chi, but I'm not out of options!" - yang, loading up the glock
[5:28:53] <%Namillus> What I'm wondering is are they REALLY at the old dojo's courtyard in this moment
[5:29:03] <BlackermanZX> The final art of kung fu... THUGGERY kolWESCI
[5:29:07] <%andrewofbob> @thotbane Well, there was only one door to the office and it lead back to where the Skill Tree is planted, when the tree isn't there, and it's raining like on the night of Yang's attack
[5:29:12] <mackovoir> "Give it to me! That thing, your... talisman!"
[5:29:22] <penitentpendant> @Namillus The secret final element: Space Manipulation
[5:29:24] <+sevorai> nah definitely not, purely the magic that you've seen with the other bosses
[5:29:26] <GrizzlyMannerz> atp0in20
[5:29:33] <edward0286> I swear it seems like in this phase, you can’t use the same combo twice when you counter
[5:29:40] <%Namillus> I don't think it's magic, it's more like psychology
[5:29:40] <dds333a> @mackovoir WHAT? STILL HERE?
[5:29:46] <zenith0111> Thats YOUR sweep
[5:30:16] <+EightBitVision> if only you can block
[5:30:16] <penitentpendant> @Namillus That falls apart at the 'stopping the falling elevator' in the building
[5:30:21] <+swesterly> come back in ten yeahs
[5:30:29] <+Shoryo_Tori> you can ground parry him pretty reliably after getting knocked down
[5:30:34] <%Namillus> No I mean this scene specifically, everywhere else, yeah, definitely magic
[5:30:42] <jetstreamlove_R> @edward0286 Whit the bosses you gotta time it correctly whit the proper cheese combo strat
[5:30:49] <henshin2289> No you're using parts of his move list.
[5:31:02] <Invess> @henshin2289 oh shit
[5:31:03] <OblivionSword1> the stun punch and the sweeps is the real killer move
[5:31:07] <+sevorai> Yang has been healing people with the talisman he copped off the MCs dad
[5:31:08] <%Namillus> It doesn't matter where the fight is happening, both the PC and Yang are fundamentally bound to this place and this moment
[5:31:11] <Hozak> Is it Woolie playing?
[5:31:11] <$thotbane> Yang is a beast
[5:31:21] <dds333a> @hozak yep
[5:31:26] <%Charronia> Dude talking like he's Toki with his healing powers
[5:31:38] <$thotbane> @Charronia Toki kills everyone he loves
[5:31:40] <dds333a> @charronia Toki :( :( :(
[5:31:45] <+sevorai> So its not hard to believe that this is all just a space that he's made like the others have done
[5:31:46] <Hozak> @dds333a Thanks!
[5:31:51] <+EightBitVision> your shrine investment COULD pay off if you parry more lol
[5:31:59] <henshin2289> Nothing is "unparryable" btw... Idk why he keeps saying that
[5:32:02] <dds333a> The Jesus of the New Century
[5:32:18] <+ghostfaceninja_> surely healing people comes at some price right? equivalent exchange?
[5:32:19] <GrizzlyMannerz> atp0in20 atpDance atp0in20
[5:32:20] <OblivionSword1> yes
[5:32:22] <+ArcanumArcanum> you are mistaken, yes
[5:32:24] <%pi_in_the_sci> Yes, that is a mistake
[5:32:25] <GrizzlyMannerz> atpOld NotLikeThis
[5:32:27] <+mechslayer71> you are mistaken
[5:32:28] <+Shoryo_Tori> There are soft and Hard Parries
[5:32:29] <zenith0111> Mistake
[5:32:31] <dds333a> @ghostfaceninja_ Kappa
[5:32:31] <+Noraje> you can actually parry those
[5:32:31] <$Rafraud> Oh no
[5:32:32] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus glowing is a guard break not unparryable
[5:32:34] <OblivionSword1> only red glow (grab) is unparryable
[5:32:35] <+asymSka> c
[5:32:36] <Azure_Inc> Glowing auras ARE parryable. But they're better to dodge.
[5:32:36] <teefpal> Soft and hard parries
[5:32:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[5:32:37] <+ArcanumArcanum> glowing means you take chip damage
[5:32:37] <henshin2289> Just means you take more structure damage
[5:32:37] <thackattack00> You are mistaken
[5:32:38] <%RyTYoung> They can be parried
[5:32:38] <+Xx_HD_xX> Unless their sructure is about to great yes
[5:32:43] <tolloponik> glow is unblockable
[5:32:44] <+mechslayer71> it does way more structure damage if you guard
[5:32:44] <soflicar> you can parry everything but throws
[5:32:45] <$Rafraud> Woolie level up time
[5:32:46] <+Xx_HD_xX> about to break*
[5:32:49] <+JustToWatch> glowing aura means it does massive sturcture damage, not unparryable
[5:32:51] <jetstreamlove_R> Glowings can be be parried
[5:32:53] <+TheOlMitcheroo> No they can be parried, I'm 80% sure
[5:32:54] <zenith0111> I feel the pain
[5:32:56] <+EightBitVision> parryable... not blockable
[5:32:56] <Azure_Inc> RED glows and Big Dude throws are unparryable.
[5:32:56] <%baronblank> Glow means tighter parry timing i think
[5:32:57] <%pi_in_the_sci> glowing fist one
[5:32:59] <tuckerdonovan> glow just means heavy structure damage, they're parryable but somewhat difficult to time
[5:33:00] <dds333a> "I see" wise words
[5:33:03] <BlackermanZX> think of it as 3rd strike
[5:33:05] <henshin2289> You've parried many glowing limbs
[5:33:09] <teefpal> Easy parries vs hard parries
[5:33:15] <+mechslayer71> throws
[5:33:16] <+ArcanumArcanum> Parry isn't a block though
[5:33:16] <%andrewofbob> Not a throw
[5:33:16] <@Solidus_113> throws
[5:33:20] <AngryAsian5> THROWS cannot be blocked or deflected
[5:33:21] <Broand> That says throws
[5:33:22] <soflicar> that says throws
[5:33:22] <penitentpendant> "Throws cannot be blocked or deflected"
[5:33:23] <+JustToWatch> it says throws
[5:33:24] <+mechslayer71> THROWS
[5:33:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> i've parried a glowing attack when the enemy was at low structure so... I dunno
[5:33:29] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Yeah THROWS are unparryable, Guardbreaks ARE
[5:33:30] <skagtheprinceofhell> Wait so parry and deflect are different?
[5:33:30] <$Rafraud> It says throws
[5:33:30] <dds333a> Woolz, throws
[5:33:31] <Azure_Inc> That says throws Woolie
[5:33:32] <+Xx_HD_xX> Deflect vs Parry?
[5:33:32] <jetstreamlove_R> throws
[5:33:39] <%DaRoosta89> red moves does a lot of structure dmg on block
[5:33:41] <skagtheprinceofhell> Oh yeah, that says throws
[5:33:45] <+ArcanumArcanum> You should "try" to avoid them. Not you "have" to avoid them.
[5:33:49] <$Rafraud> Woolie is right, Chat is righter, wording is not clear
[5:33:54] <xbb1024> Parrys are deflects
[5:33:56] <+JustToWatch> throws and guardbreak both glow
[5:34:00] <%RyTYoung> Because they do big structure damage, BUT can still be parried
[5:34:00] <skagtheprinceofhell> @xbb1024 Okay
[5:34:02] <DXLelouch24> BUT you dont have too and if you do perfect parry them they get massive structure dmg
[5:34:07] <+FoxLex_> No the wording is clear
[5:34:07] <dds333a> Yes, it is different
[5:34:08] <+mechslayer71> the wording is a bit off tho tbf
[5:34:09] <+nolawg> try it out only true way to see
[5:34:12] <@SoushinSen> making paragraphs liek that makes it confusing, yeah
[5:34:12] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Parrys are NOT deflects, deflects are imperfect parries
[5:34:13] <tuckerdonovan> Even if you get the parry on a guardbreak, you'll still get a lot of structure damage, but sometimes it's the best option
[5:34:14] <+MrMcCrabby> i think this is teaching you about two different moves
[5:34:14] <zenith0111> Bad wording
[5:34:15] <OblivionSword1> it says should not must
[5:34:16] <$Rafraud> Should have been worded better, you're good tbh
[5:34:17] <AngryAsian5> The wording is weird to be fair
[5:34:20] <DianaTheAscian> Okay I also read it completely wrong somehow
[5:34:21] <edward0286> @jetstreamlove_r yea I’m still working on the under 25 run, but Yang is a big mix of parry and dodging property
[5:34:22] <BlackermanZX> wording is not good
[5:34:22] <+Shoryo_Tori> A parry dosnt prevent structure damage
[5:34:23] <+Jiggisnipe> is the parry a dodge?
[5:34:23] <skagtheprinceofhell> Yeah it is probably better to avoid but I guess just depends?
[5:34:24] <henshin2289> Its ok so did a lot of others
[5:34:25] <Hammatime8> Bad wording
[5:34:26] <%RyTYoung> Only avoid when you need structure back
[5:34:26] <GrizzlyMannerz> atpRtsd4
[5:34:30] <thackattack00> This game really needs a much more comprehensive tutorial
[5:34:37] <+Bamcc2> Welp sabert14Bruh
[5:34:41] <+Lord0Mugen> ive heard dodge rules all in this game
[5:34:41] <thackattack00> So much shit is unclear
[5:34:43] <skagtheprinceofhell> Well it's less bad wording and more it is telling you it's probably better to avoid
[5:34:45] <+polothegreatest> Yugioh card errorr
[5:34:49] <penitentpendant> It's safer to dodge, so that's fair
[5:34:52] <dds333a> Which is the case in MANY other games LUL
[5:34:54] <+FoxLex_> It's not bad wording
[5:34:59] <BlackermanZX> hell in other games usually glowing means avoid LUL
[5:35:01] <henshin2289> Parry low attacks, avoid high attacks.
[5:35:02] <%RyTYoung> Dodge does rule over parry due to dazing the bosses easy that way
[5:35:03] <wibbwobbler> Might get confusing because throws can glow as well
[5:35:08] <+FoxLex_> That's reading comprehension
[5:35:10] <+sevorai> There have been some glowing hits you've parried from goons that I've seen you do this stream @WoolieVersus  on accident
[5:35:17] <+EightBitVision> you never accidently parry one with your mashing? lmao
[5:35:25] <$Rafraud> Its not solid enough of a sentence
[5:35:27] <DXLelouch24> for Yang Parrying is THEY WAY, because his hp is massive
[5:35:27] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I've parried my way through Yang at 2 deaths, you can parry those guard breaks if you're perfect
[5:35:27] <+Lord0Mugen> It also doesnt help is that the game has unblockables and patterns that arent shown.
[5:35:30] <edward0286> Avoiding helps when you have the regain structure ability, whereas parry helps with the structure impact ability
[5:35:30] <@SoushinSen> It's the text boxes. it should have been two text boxes instead of 4.
[5:35:31] <dds333a> @foxlex_ don't worry, we all know Woolz can't read LUL
[5:35:33] <$Rafraud> It needs to explicitly say one or the other
[5:35:34] <+ghostfaceninja_> the implication...
[5:35:39] <BlackermanZX> its not clear enough
[5:35:46] <dds333a> I also do think it's unclear, seriously
[5:35:50] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Parry is NOT deflect
[5:35:54] <+mechslayer71> I think that's a translation issues
[5:35:55] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Deflect is an imperfect parry
[5:36:00] <zenith0111> Thats the games fault tbh
[5:36:03] <henshin2289> Parry is deflect lol
[5:36:05] <+sevorai> its all good, bad part on them
[5:36:07] <T_Sasquatch> Glowing  attack means avoid in literally any other game LUL
[5:36:07] <+Xx_HD_xX> I've found you can when their structure is about to break to can parry successfully?
[5:36:11] <%andrewofbob> @DXLelouch24 The win condition on bosses has been breaking structure, anyway
[5:36:11] <%RyTYoung> Its definitely not clear enough, as much as I love the intro tutorial it’s not as in depth as you’d like
[5:36:34] <+Jiggisnipe> @T_Sasquatch I mean the game also said you should avoid them too
[5:36:36] <tuckerdonovan> they should let you replay the intro tutorial bits in training, at the very least
[5:36:43] <ElkRiverDog> Lab is back in session
[5:36:44] <+mechslayer71> the risk is necessarily way higher on partying them tho, so that's probably want they meant
[5:36:45] <teefpal> Holy shit, 77 years old
[5:36:46] <+Lord0Mugen> Snakeyes beat Yang with 2 hit combo frame traps.
[5:36:46] <+EightBitVision> tbh i never read anything on that board... had to learn the old way... playing it
[5:36:59] <dds333a> @eightbitvision LUL LUL
[5:37:03] <Azure_Inc> Old age hours
[5:37:04] <GrizzlyMannerz> atp0in20 atpSuspect atp0in20
[5:37:05] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:37:06] <+sevorai> training mode definitely should be more fleshed out with the abilitiy to change enemy types
[5:37:08] <jetstreamlove_R> That last line hits home for woolie LUL
[5:37:09] <+ProfessorMorrigan> yang stylin on grandma
[5:37:10] <DSD24> Yang was such a jerk
[5:37:11] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Beating this @ 20 speedruns are oddly hallow
[5:37:16] <+Shoryo_Tori> The game dosnt make it clear that that there are two forms of parry
[5:37:21] <OblivionSword1> you can parry glowing attack it's just tricky
[5:37:22] <BlackermanZX> that flying kick tho
[5:37:25] <penitentpendant> It's Lab O'Clock!
[5:37:33] <+sevorai> Lab Open?????
[5:37:38] <+Xx_HD_xX> @Shoryo_Tori Parry & perfect parry
[5:37:49] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie refuses to open the Lab
[5:37:52] <jetstreamlove_R> Open the lab I want my chemist drink on!
[5:37:56] <+Rigid_Digidi> Open the lab
[5:37:56] <zenith0111> I dont know if you noticed. But theyve been trying to take out unblockables in most games
[5:37:57] <+FoxLex_> You can parry it but the timing is very tight
[5:38:08] <+mechslayer71> that bug jump from boss 3 sec9nd stage? parryable, I've done it
[5:38:08] <+polothegreatest> lab dimension plagueTaps
[5:38:11] <BlackermanZX> he doesnt need to open it because its always open kolGlasses
[5:38:13] <+mechslayer71> big*
[5:38:14] <penitentpendant> @Jiggisnipe Why would he open what's always open?
[5:38:14] <AngryAsian5> The lab is never closed when Woolie has the controller LUL
[5:38:15] <+fumbles_tho> This wal mart greeter gets it so hard
[5:38:19] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Woolie's favorite QB...Donovan McLab
[5:38:24] <edward0286> I think yea when it’s glowing, the window is very small, but only when it’s orange
[5:38:29] <henshin2289> Parring guard crushes will not award you with a punish till their structure is low enough.
[5:38:36] <cooldude69xx> @zenith0111 Unblockables were never all that popular
[5:38:36] <dds333a> @angryasian5 always learning, always eating shit, and then learning it good
[5:38:39] <%andrewofbob> Shittalking on the sucker punch
[5:38:41] <+Jiggisnipe> true true the lab is always open even without a sign
[5:38:43] <+EightBitVision> just play it like life. . what works for you may not work for me and vice versa...
[5:38:50] <dds333a> The last bit may or may not ever happen LUL
[5:38:56] <zenith0111> @cooldude69xx Either gimmicky af or broken and unfun
[5:39:02] <AngryAsian5> @dds333a This is the way.
[5:39:18] <+EightBitVision> you don't NEED to parry the unblockables...
[5:39:27] <mackovoir> Uh oh, Woolie's in the lab again. Rereading any tips he's been imagining.
[5:39:35] <jetstreamlove_R> Jump failed, structure destroyed!
[5:39:49] <BlackermanZX> good ol shanky shank
[5:39:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:39:50] <+ghostfaceninja_> they really screwed up not having a hammer as one of the weapons
[5:39:53] <+FoxLex_> It's better to dodge orange strikes because they reward for parrying dependent on structure while dodging gives you a free stun
[5:39:58] <$Rafraud> bok
[5:40:02] <$Rafraud> bonk
[5:40:08] <xerotwo> TANAKA THAI KICKU
[5:40:24] <dds333a> handled
[5:40:27] <zenith0111> I think whats interesting about the weapon fighters is that theyre much better hand to hand fighter
[5:40:36] <+NopeBadguy> yo is this game supposed to remind me of karateka
[5:40:38] <Hammatime8> No deaths so far!
[5:40:51] <dds333a> @zenith0111 it's to throw off the opponent LUL
[5:41:02] <+AutomatedSquid> look at this crusty ass boss
[5:41:05] <DSD24> I like this boss theme
[5:41:14] <+mechslayer71> yeah staff suck for him
[5:41:22] <ovejart> zoneNotLikeThis
[5:41:29] <dds333a> We get it, Yang
[5:41:33] <PALWolfOS> That’s pretty accurate irl, a weapon of any kind is better than your fists @zenith0111
[5:41:40] <+Bamcc2> He's beginning to Believe
[5:41:47] <+EightBitVision> forget staff... go back to what works
[5:41:53] <DSD24> All this shit talk
[5:41:55] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[5:41:56] <tolloponik> He Said the LINE!!!!
[5:42:00] <BlackermanZX> all this money and couldnt buy armor to prevent getting shanked
[5:42:03] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie wasn't using a staff before
[5:42:21] <zenith0111> @palwolfos The warriors deadliest tool is his hands. Which are rated E for Everyone
[5:42:22] <+EightBitVision> now his crutch is gone he can walk
[5:42:37] <ovejart> *teleports behind you*
[5:42:44] <DSD24> Crotch punch
[5:42:49] <T3mperance> It sucks you can't use your focus moves on him
[5:42:57] <dds333a> @palwolfos yeah, what he's saying this that the dudes that wield weapons in this game seem to be even better without them
[5:43:03] <xerotwo> woolieFROG
[5:43:04] <henshin2289> Yeah crotch punch OD
[5:43:05] <+EightBitVision> right in exbaby maker
[5:43:18] <dds333a> Dem dodges
[5:43:22] <teefpal> Ok, how does this boss even work?  He just seems like a big autoblocker/dodger
[5:43:22] <+mechslayer71> @t3mperance I disagree, I think it's great. swipe the crutch out from under the arm
[5:43:27] <xerotwo> If only God Hand got a sequel/remaster
[5:43:36] <mackovoir> it's fine we're still pre-menopause
[5:43:39] <%badguy8312> fuck up this wolf fang fist mother fucker
[5:43:39] <DSD24> @teefpal Its really parry focused
[5:43:44] <dds333a> @xerotwo a sequel would be NUTS

[5:43:53] <+Xx_HD_xX> We all knew it LUL

[5:44:16] <xerotwo> I'm not holding my breath on Capcom doing something daring
[5:44:23] <xerotwo> *brave
[5:44:28] <DSD24> I hate that line" Oh man I saved lives since I killed your dad, you can't see it"
[5:44:44] <cooldude69xx> @DSD24 I mean, by all accounts, it is true
[5:44:44] <DSD24> Well yeah? You are still shit talking him even now
[5:44:48] <zenith0111> @xerotwo MH on Console and being their best selling game of all time will probably make them more daring
[5:44:49] <%andrewofbob> Have there been any ambitions on adding Gene to MvC?
[5:44:54] <PALWolfOS> It’s the truth
[5:44:54] <DSD24> @cooldude69xx Oh for sure
[5:45:02] <+ghostfaceninja_> this boss fight is kinda like Vergil, he does everything you do just better, and you have to bait him into openings
[5:45:11] <+EightBitVision> next time leave the staff behind lol
[5:45:20] <%badguy8312> @ghostfaceninja_ don't forget the rainnnnn
[5:45:37] <skagtheprinceofhell> He's also just better cause he has more of the moves unlocked
[5:45:38] <zenith0111> Just let me have hope BibleThump
[5:45:39] <+ghostfaceninja_> but they're not shirtless LUL
[5:45:47] <+Xx_HD_xX> Hahaha
[5:45:48] <%andrewofbob> That was the charge move
[5:45:49] <ovejart> zoneNotLikeThis
[5:45:51] <TheSaltminer> CHARGED BACKFIST
[5:45:51] <+KgKid51> sheesh
[5:45:52] <jetstreamlove_R> Fighting shirtless in the rain
[5:45:52] <skagtheprinceofhell> He taunted!
[5:45:52] <mackovoir> took the bait!!!
[5:45:52] <AnnoyedApricot> HE KNOWS
[5:45:53] <%Zero_Jacks> Aye Yo
[5:45:54] <$Rafraud> STAY AWAKE
[5:45:55] <TheSaltminer> EAT IT
[5:45:55] <zenith0111> OOOOOOO
[5:45:57] <penitentpendant> My Focus Attack!
[5:45:57] <Azure_Inc> He knows dude.
[5:45:57] <BlackermanZX> LOL
[5:45:58] <+Bamcc2> RyuChamp naltyOoo
[5:45:59] <dds333a> He sure does
[5:46:00] <DSD24> Charged fist
[5:46:00] <xbb1024> it's a vengeance quest, so it's irrelevant how many lives he's saved since
[5:46:02] <$Rafraud> SLEEPING AT THE STICKS
[5:46:03] <%pi_in_the_sci> charged backfist used right
[5:46:04] <henshin2289> You can charge backfist his charge backfist
[5:46:05] <TheSaltminer> GET A PIECE OF IT
[5:46:12] <%andrewofbob> Time to read the startup
[5:46:20] <DSD24> Yes best look obtained
[5:46:22] <+EightBitVision> that charge up move sux but you can see it easily
[5:46:29] <DSD24> 40 is when you look the coolest
[5:46:41] <andre11dr> He started hitting you with the elbows
[5:46:47] <edward0286> Yang has everything you can get, and his own move set
[5:46:56] <+Jiggisnipe> @DSD24 that's why Yakuza 7 is the best Persona game
[5:46:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:47:01] <TheSaltminer> what I want to know is, if he does all the same moves you know, does that mean you can learn that rushing swipes move of his?
[5:47:14] <mackovoir> ^
[5:47:19] <DSD24> @TheSaltminer Sadly I don't think you can ever get it
[5:47:23] <+Jiggisnipe> asking the real questions
[5:47:23] <dds333a> @jiggisnipe absolutely based
[5:47:25] <%pi_in_the_sci> I feel like he has a hidden style counter, he doesn't fall for moves if you don
[5:47:30] <%Namillus> He didn't teach you everything HE knows, just everything YOU know.
[5:47:34] <+Comb711> @TheSaltminer Yeah it's light after a pushback
[5:47:38] <+meteor530> Yr body is WEAK child...
[5:47:50] <zenith0111> Wheres the mod that lets you play as all the bosses and the mod that makes it multiplayer?
[5:47:53] <+ghostfaceninja_> doodNuts get motivated
[5:48:02] <+NopeBadguy> what's the age limit before you just can't continue
[5:48:04] <andre11dr> @jiggisnipe This is just the truth, nothing more nothing less
[5:48:09] <dds333a> 70's
[5:48:10] <TheSaltminer> @NopeBadguy 70
[5:48:11] <Ardisan_> How far is woolie in this game?
[5:48:16] <%badguy8312> don't these fuckers know what guns are
[5:48:21] <DSD24> @Ardisan_ Very end
[5:48:23] <mackovoir> @Ardisan_ the end :)
[5:48:25] <dds333a> @ardisan_ this is it
[5:48:27] <Hammatime8> That follow-up grab HAS to be avoidable, right?
[5:48:29] <teefpal> This is the final boss
[5:48:41] <Ardisan_> Oh so that far
[5:48:54] <+meteor530> This game SUPER ain't for me but it's fun watching other people struggle their hearts out :P
[5:49:47] <andre11dr> Yeah i beat this but I'm not really feeling like trying to get the true ending
[5:49:52] <+EightBitVision> nothing like a boss aging you from 27 to 75 lol
[5:50:05] <+ghostfaceninja_> we labbin
[5:50:12] <ovejart> welcome to the-

[5:50:38] <teefpal> How many endings are there?
[5:50:39] <+NopeBadguy> @EightBitVision feel like a great gag in the making where someone physically ages as they die
[5:50:40] <morkelebmink> welcome to the sanctuary 'gets head crushed against wall'
[5:50:43] <trillkagemac> All about sweeps lol
[5:50:45] <+Rigid_Digidi> @teefpal 2
[5:50:48] <dds333a> Hit credits, like always
[5:50:50] <Jaysky> I think you can only do one ending on your first time
[5:50:53] <+EightBitVision> true ending is a blast
[5:50:54] <zenith0111> Its better to playthrough twice
[5:51:05] <zenith0111> Its kind of intended
[5:51:08] <+ghostfaceninja_> ya gotta hand it to these workers, I would just stand in the corner LUL
[5:51:14] <teefpal> womp womp
[5:51:18] <+NopeBadguy> wait
[5:51:20] <+NopeBadguy> did someone tell you
[5:51:21] <dds333a> Reg LUL
[5:51:22] <%andrewofbob> Chat has been spoilering hard
[5:51:22] <ClicheHiei> Kill that mofo thou
[5:51:23] <+NopeBadguy> or did pat tell you
[5:51:26] <%badguy8312> moist taught me
[5:51:30] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Have you tried being water? It's atheory ive been hypothesizing
[5:51:30] <henshin2289> Phase two is all about getting his structure up with parries, and then avoiding to get your structure back. Its why he has long strings of attacks.
[5:51:32] <+Jiggisnipe> he found out by mistake and then Pat just told him how to do it lol
[5:51:33] <andre11dr> Didn't Pat tell him?
[5:51:34] <ovejart> wait what
[5:51:37] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Goddammit, who did it
[5:51:39] <DSD24> More like a mercy run
[5:51:40] <edward0286> Who spoiled that chat?
[5:51:43] <powerprotoman> yeah it was pat who told him that
[5:51:46] <+ALazo> I'm kind of shocked you didn't run into it in your practice runs of the first two
[5:51:49] <powerprotoman> on the podcast
[5:51:52] <+Comb711> Pat told him on the pod
[5:51:52] <AngryAsian5> I think Pat told him on the podcast
[5:51:53] <+Xx_HD_xX> I wish you would have been surprised by it BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[5:51:54] <+Parrish_broadnax> in another timeline we can spare them. Good thing that aint this one.
[5:51:55] <+KgKid51> of course it was pat KEKHeim
[5:51:55] <+meteor530> Spike-Yr Tense, I'm not.
[5:51:56] <zenith0111> Pat NotLikeThis
[5:52:01] <+ghostfaceninja_> fucking Pat...
[5:52:01] <morkelebmink> Pat ruins everything heh
[5:52:02] <penitentpendant> Pat's argument was: "You wouldn't learn this naturally."
[5:52:03] <Hozak> This guy is having the worst day
[5:52:07] <DXLelouch24> tbf its not really clear how after you beat it
[5:52:08] <+EightBitVision> sparring should be easier for you with that massive parry shrine build lmao
[5:52:10] <edward0286> You can’t do that till you beat the game but still guys come on
[5:52:12] <+Fetrigon> patSpoilsAt
[5:52:14] <+Parrish_broadnax> He knew before pat
[5:52:15] <dds333a> @penitentpendant based
[5:52:17] <+Jelmauz> woolieFROG 💢
[5:52:18] <+TheOlMitcheroo> @penitentpendant tbf he's right
[5:52:21] <+JustToWatch> it wasn't Pat, he knew that before Pat
[5:52:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> Woolie was already spoiled before the podcast guys
[5:52:24] <BlackermanZX> woolz knew it already
[5:52:26] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek creepy49Porpkek
[5:52:32] <%badguy8312> just a no revenge run
[5:52:34] <skagtheprinceofhell> It's play it like a martial arts movie
[5:52:37] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Sip
[5:52:38] <Jaysky> It's more of a don't kill run
[5:52:40] <%townzzzzz> way of the closed fist, way of the open fist kinda thing
[5:52:42] <+Parrish_broadnax> he told pat he knew before hand
[5:52:42] <+meteor530> Pat didn't ruin it for him chat...THE WORLD ruined it for Woolie
[5:52:47] <DSD24> Fall damage
[5:52:47] <+Rigid_Digidi> you still have to kill the goons. I guess their lives dont matter
[5:52:49] <dds333a> WHAT IS HAPPENING
[5:52:49] <%Namillus> "You kick everyone's ass, but you don't KILL anyone"
[5:52:50] <+Deosier> wish my local restaurant employees were trained like these guys
[5:52:51] <PALWolfOS> Eh, only if you’re the type to always takedown
[5:52:52] <+Xx_HD_xX> I guess as longa  you don't know what it looks like yet the that's good.
[5:52:55] <Ardisan_> Blame the beast
[5:52:56] <penitentpendant> @Jaysky And minions don't count. So knife away!
[5:53:02] <DXLelouch24> @Rigid_Digidi well yea their basically npcs
[5:53:03] <+fumbles_tho> She fell and concussed herself like a asshole
[5:53:03] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Awkward Position my twin sister
[5:53:04] <Jaysky> The Batman route
[5:53:06] <CommandantKobold> They don't build chairs like the used to smh
[5:53:09] <%Namillus> The Kiryu Route
[5:53:13] <DXLelouch24> no names or anythings
[5:53:16] <DSD24> All those guards throat's you slit
[5:53:18] <T_Sasquatch> I think woolie knew that from the first time he streamed because of one guy in chat then pat just told him because its supposedly not clear
[5:53:18] <$Rafraud> Says jober #3
[5:53:21] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I wish the Calbot did structure damage
[5:53:23] <+meteor530> When's Majima gonna show
[5:53:24] <Jaysky> Make them wish they were dead Run
[5:53:27] <mackovoir> did Pat tell you about the secret ending where Yang kills you and takes your credit card?
[5:53:33] <PALWolfOS> Ignore the red stuff that shows up sometimes, it’s rubber blood
[5:53:34] <teefpal> The blood splatters and throat cuts are totally harmless
[5:53:38] <+Parrish_broadnax> every time they break furniture I Hear mr Krabs "That cost me Money!"
[5:53:39] <dds333a> @t_sasquatch yeah, it actually is not
[5:53:44] <+ghostfaceninja_> mankind knew they cannot change society...
[5:53:49] <+Xx_HD_xX> @TheOlMitcheroo Getting the 5x multiplier is a pretty good trade off though
[5:53:56] <+meteor530> so they chose to spoil woolie instead
[5:53:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:53:57] <T_Sasquatch> No kill except when its bosses Kappa
[5:54:02] <+AWKWARDL0SER> It's weird to spare the Bosses and kill the henchman
[5:54:08] <+Jiggisnipe> dw those stabbed people are alive Kappa
[5:54:08] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Goon lives don't matter LUL
[5:54:11] <penitentpendant> "They don't count! They're not people!"
[5:54:12] <+fumbles_tho> Vengence vs "forgiveness"
[5:54:16] <Guigondi> I enjoy the dicotomy in how Max and Woolie play this game.
[5:54:18] <+meteor530> Jobbers lives are nothing
[5:54:18] <Guigondi> Max blazes through without much concern for lore or absolute perfection. Woolie leaves no stone unturned in exploring the lore but even more so, the mechanics
[5:54:18] <teefpal> Kiryu rules, nobody dies unless its a plot death
[5:54:19] <zenith0111> Its the MGS style of boss design where the spare route is technically the hard route
[5:54:23] <+TheOlMitcheroo> @TheOlMitcheroo OH is that what it does? That's awesome
[5:54:23] <andre11dr> No kill ,except all those guys i stabbed on my way here
[5:54:26] <DXLelouch24> basically i can do this all day so backdown
[5:54:27] <+EightBitVision> only no kill bosses... pawns can die
[5:54:27] <+NopeBadguy> yo stabbing is my favorite martial art
[5:54:29] <+polothegreatest> ah yes, the TLOU2 treatment
[5:54:31] <+ghostfaceninja_> get one shot LUL
[5:54:33] <cooldude69xx> @AWKWARDL0SER If you just dont stab them in the heart, you can pretend to yourself that you're like Kiryu
[5:54:38] <%andrewofbob> I didn't think Sifu looked like the nicest guy; maybe Yang was fighting for something noble. (Don't answer this, chat)
[5:54:47] <+NopeBadguy> bonked that dude to death
[5:54:51] <%Namillus> @AWKWARDL0SER [footage of Kiryu stabbing someone several times in the heart]
[5:54:53] <dds333a> @andrewofbob answer
[5:55:03] <DSD24> There was that one knife execution where you stab them in the gut
[5:55:06] <Hammatime8> Slash a few throats, no big deal :)
[5:55:12] <cooldude69xx> @AWKWARDL0SER "The knife was rubber! You're a genius Kiryu!"
[5:55:19] <Azure_Inc> He found it.
[5:55:21] <DSD24> Its my favorite execution because of how brutal it is
[5:55:21] <+polothegreatest> also batman runovers with his batmobile
[5:55:22] <%Namillus> The trick is, of course, the ultraviolence fights only happen in Kiryu's head
[5:55:26] <%andrewofbob> PARRIED A RED
[5:55:27] <$Rafraud> he's learning
[5:55:40] <+Xx_HD_xX> He'
[5:55:42] <+ghostfaceninja_> you know that some of these goons you're killing have kids who will seek revenge...
[5:55:43] <+Xx_HD_xX> s spamming LUL
[5:55:43] <+meteor530> Die bish
[5:55:47] <dds333a> Grab SPAM

[5:57:17] <+ghostfaceninja_> you showed that fence Woolie LUL
[5:57:19] <TheSaltminer> CHUCK A BRICK AT YANG
[5:57:21] <Hammatime8> Whoops LUL
[5:57:23] <+EightBitVision> did yourself a favor
[5:57:29] <dds333a> I need a WEAPON
[5:57:34] <Jaysky> Violent Woolie acquired
[5:57:41] <BlackermanZX> fuck that fence in particular
[5:57:44] <+Bamcc2> Woolie is Ready naltySus
[5:57:45] <mackovoir> He finally learned about dodge offset

[5:58:01] <+EightBitVision> you'll no death 1st stage yang now
[5:58:04] <%Namillus> It's locked in now
[5:58:10] <%badguy8312> about to Deebo yang
[5:58:14] <Dave_VD> Wait what’d he just learn?
[5:58:15] <zenith0111> Channel your inner wing chun
[5:58:15] <$Rafraud> If I had a Nickle for everytime @WoolieVersus has played an entire game without a mechanic, I'd have two Nickles, which isn't alot but its weird that its happened twice
[5:58:18] <alexandrecau> he  figured it out
[5:58:25] <trillkagemac> You can parry sweeps too
[5:58:26] <+EightBitVision> that staff was holding you back
[5:58:27] <andre11dr> Yang might've mastered all your moves, but unlike you Yang is not 🅿️
[5:58:29] <Guigondi> Woolie was Nuzlocking himself without knowing?
[5:58:34] <dds333a> @rafraud more than that LUL
[5:58:45] <Hozak> I had to step away. What big thing did Woolie figure out?
[5:58:57] <dds333a> My personal favorite is in Raidou, where he literally never gave his demons a single command
[5:58:58] <%badguy8312> @hozak the heart of the cards
[5:59:04] <penitentpendant> @Hozak You can parry unblockables
[5:59:08] <Hozak> @badguy8312 I knew he could do it!
[5:59:12] <%andrewofbob> Is there a reason Yang's structure is red, or did QA Power kick in?
[5:59:13] <Hozak> @penitentpendant woo!
[5:59:20] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL

[6:01:08] <mackovoir> @morkelebmink that makes me wanna learn how to mod
[6:01:09] <+Comb711> Good ass phase
[6:01:15] <DSD24> I wanna have a fight in the rain like this one day
[6:01:19] <skyshinecrusader> Do focus attacks not work on yang?
[6:01:24] <DSD24> All atmospheric and shit
[6:01:25] <TurranosOrn> they don't
[6:01:27] <+Iwaitodai> I want Kiryu to walk through the door and use beast style to throw a motorcycle at someone
[6:01:29] <Azure_Inc> @skyshinecrusader Nope
[6:01:30] <dds333a> correct
[6:01:30] <skyshinecrusader> ahh
[6:01:30] <TurranosOrn> he's immune to focus attacks
[6:01:31] <penitentpendant> @mackovoir I mean, someone already modded John Wick into this game
[6:01:32] <DXLelouch24> @skyshinecrusader nope time to gitgud
[6:01:34] <+NopeBadguy> @DSD24 hey bro let's go fight in the rain
[6:01:34] <DXLelouch24> fuck yo focus
[6:01:39] <+EightBitVision> all those fast strikes are parryable...fux up yangs structure
[6:01:41] <TurranosOrn> he literally just mocks you if you switch into focus mode
[6:01:41] <skagtheprinceofhell> @skyshinecrusader I think it's more he won;t give you a chance to
[6:01:43] <Hozak> Someone also modded Shaggy int oteh game
[6:01:46] <andre11dr> @blackermanzx I'm more salty that he fought the final boss with the stupid monkey when he had end game demons in his pocket
[6:01:49] <skagtheprinceofhell> @penitentpendant Wait really?
[6:01:50] <alexandrecau> they super don't
[6:01:55] <+ghostfaceninja_> @penitentpendant for real?? I'm off to google LUL
[6:01:58] <DSD24> @NopeBadguy We can do a cool card battle so we won't actually get hurt
[6:01:59] <Jaysky> Did he just walk up down smash?
[6:02:05] <%andrewofbob> Yang is always focused
[6:02:05] <Azure_Inc> The modding community works fast.
[6:02:06] <teefpal> Shaggy and John Wick are both modded into this game
[6:02:16] <DSD24> CJ from San Andreas too
[6:02:24] <+EightBitVision> snow white
[6:02:25] <Azure_Inc> You can play as the bosses, Scorpion, Wick, Shaggy, Snow White, Azula, Agent 47, etc
[6:02:29] <penitentpendant> @skagtheprinceofhell Yeah, they show off "The Club" with him
[6:02:42] <dds333a> @azure_inc damn, 47? It's over
[6:03:05] <penitentpendant> @dds333a Bonus points if he only grows facial hair
[6:03:11] <+EightBitVision> I'm surprise no Jackie chan or jet li mod
[6:03:14] <skagtheprinceofhell> Huh, they have a Snow White model
[6:03:19] <dds333a> @penitentpendant LUL LUL
[6:03:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> beat his ass
[6:03:35] <DSD24> Got the cool jacket back
[6:03:38] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus damage wont help with yang you gotta learn how to parry or die
[6:03:38] <penitentpendant> @dds333a Although, then I'd expect him to say "BOY" as a taunt...
[6:03:44] <Hozak> I like how this asshole is saying "i've saved so many lives so that makes what I did okay"
[6:03:54] <DSD24> @Hozak Because he's a asshole
[6:03:56] <+sevorai> download complete????
[6:03:57] <dds333a> @penitentpendant or drink like Nu Max Payne
[6:04:07] <skagtheprinceofhell> Oh cool, you can play as Jungle Fury Purple Ranger
[6:04:16] <andre11dr> This looks like the one
[6:04:16] <Hozak> And also killed the protagonist
[6:04:18] <weasnot> BOP
[6:04:19] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Turns out dad trafficed Opium and The Gang where NARCOs
[6:04:23] <DSD24> The only one I wanted to spare originally was Kuroki
[6:04:32] <+EightBitVision> punishment is strat not aggression
[6:04:40] <cooldude69xx> @Hozak He's saying that because your master sat in the powers he's saving people with and did nothing with them
[6:04:47] <dds333a> Dodge Hype
[6:04:59] <DSD24> Still looking cool though
[6:05:01] <BlackermanZX> they still murdered an entire dojo and a child
[6:05:06] <Invess> here we go
[6:05:20] <cooldude69xx> @BlackermanZX Maybe the kid was a dick
[6:05:22] <skagtheprinceofhell> Oh, a good mod, someone made a mod to adjust the camera
[6:05:32] <Ardisan_> Maybe the kid trolled someone on roblox
[6:05:38] <DSD24> @Ardisan_ Oof

[6:07:00] <%RyTYoung> gigaboOtsMJowMAX
[6:07:06] <%andrewofbob> Ending A
[6:07:07] <DSD24> Two graves
[6:07:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> @zhenthrim213 Poetry, spelt bad jokingly
[6:07:11] <+EightBitVision> unsatisfying... go for good ending
[6:07:15] <xerotwo> IS IT WORTH IT IN THE END
[6:07:15] <andre11dr> YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD
[6:07:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> You were supposed to destroy the Sith!
[6:07:21] <T_Sasquatch> Congrats you've aged yourself for decades for revenge
[6:07:24] <zenith0111> SHAME ON YOU
[6:07:24] <Azure_Inc> "Get out... You're unworthy."
[6:07:26] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Booooooo if this is a dream
[6:07:29] <PALWolfOS> It was worth it
[6:07:30] <+Comb711> YANG DID NOTHING WRONG
[6:07:30] <zenith0111> SHAME ON OUR FAMILY
[6:07:41] <T_Sasquatch> w u d e
[6:07:45] <Invess> bad end

[6:07:54] <+Jiggisnipe> there's your clue
[6:07:54] <skagtheprinceofhell> @T_Sasquatch Congratulations, you aged yourself by decades just to style on some fools
[6:07:54] <Dakuu75> huh?
[6:07:55] <BlackermanZX> Yang Yeager did nothing wrong Keepo
[6:07:55] <SaiyanShoto> They slit a kids throat but they totally did nothing wrong
[6:07:56] <DSD24> Yang did a lot wrong actually
[6:07:57] <%RyTYoung> No credits…run it all the way BACK lytRUN
[6:07:58] <penitentpendant> This is the 'hint' to get the good ending
[6:07:59] <DianaTheAscian> oh no the tragic back story now he's morally grey
[6:07:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:08:00] <OblivionSword1> and that's your hint for the true ending
[6:08:04] <+EightBitVision> already dead... all a dream haha
[6:08:05] <+ghostfaceninja_> done hancuffed lightning
[6:08:05] <Bl4kDynamite> You lack Wude!
[6:08:06] <henshin2289> ~ W U D E ~
[6:08:09] <cooldude69xx> There's our hint for not murder ending
[6:08:09] <+FoxLex_> Hey Woolie, do it again
[6:08:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Now do it again!" - The game
[6:08:11] <+RedKazoo> W U D E
[6:08:15] <zenith0111> Quick to strike but not quick to feel.
[6:08:17] <teefpal> Eh?
[6:08:17] <+ArcanumArcanum> check the board
[6:08:18] <%andrewofbob> Different base intro
[6:08:22] <+ALazo> save his fambly
[6:08:24] <+AWKWARDL0SER> That was limp!
[6:08:25] <T_Sasquatch> Ok do it again ! Kappa
[6:08:26] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus ok now to get the true end you need to break each bosses structure 2x in their 2nd phase
[6:08:29] <dds333a> Lighting the incense, yeah
[6:08:30] <+Rigid_Digidi> Why did they have to kill the kid?
[6:08:31] <+Comb711> There's a new photo on the board with some context
[6:08:33] <DSD24> I think Yang had some backstory on that
[6:08:37] <a_mad_dragon_> now do it RIGHT SoonerLater
[6:08:38] <edward0286> Check the board
[6:08:40] <%livlinn> Fight for woolieLORE ?
[6:08:42] <skyshinecrusader> Wife and child right?
[6:08:54] <+TheOlMitcheroo> It's small but has tons of flowers from the perm upgrades
[6:08:54] <DSD24> Yang did have a wife and kid yes
[6:09:04] <%badguy8312> shit did he beat it while I went to the bathroom???
[6:09:04] <henshin2289> So whens git gud at Absolver?
[6:09:05] <andre11dr> And all the sudden Bring the Mutharfucking Ruckus starts playing
[6:09:09] <jetstreamlove_R> aight time for mercy run
[6:09:10] <+Parrish_broadnax> 20 and spry
[6:09:11] <BlackermanZX> the child killing was a liiil bit unnecesary
[6:09:17] <dds333a> @badguy8312 yep
[6:09:23] <DXLelouch24> tree only ages as you progress levels
[6:09:26] <T_Sasquatch> In hindsight godhand is super long and super varied. Its kind of insane
[6:09:27] <Dakuu75> NG+ ?
[6:09:29] <DXLelouch24> not based on skills
[6:09:35] <DSD24> @BlackermanZX Also the talking shit about the Protagonists dad during the fight
[6:09:38] <DXLelouch24> nope no NG+
[6:09:40] <dds333a> @t_sasquatch indeed it is
[6:09:44] <+EightBitVision> Go backwards on bosses to spare them.. saves your shrine investment up to that boss
[6:09:45] <%badguy8312> @dds333a what happened?
[6:09:46] <DXLelouch24> shrines reset
[6:09:50] <+PkSilent01> check
[6:09:55] <%RyTYoung> No credits either Kappa @woolieversus
[6:10:05] <cooldude69xx> I don't see how that hint was indecipherable?
[6:10:08] <%townzzzzz> beat it Kappa
[6:10:10] <+ArcanumArcanum> check the board please
[6:10:10] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I was wondering why you kept mentioning phase 3
[6:10:11] <+Jiggisnipe> did you?
[6:10:11] <%andrewofbob> Genocide ending
[6:10:12] <%Double_Tap_That> Did you beat it though?
[6:10:12] <teefpal> That's bizaare
[6:10:13] <penitentpendant> Game Over Yeaah!(?)
[6:10:13] <+FoxLex_> So we should probably mention what he has to do cus the game does not tell you in a straight forward way
[6:10:18] <DXLelouch24> its fast
[6:10:18] <+Rigid_Digidi> Its not too bad
[6:10:22] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Bad ending...is not killing the ch!ld murderers?
[6:10:22] <+Jiggisnipe> i didn't see any credits Kappa
[6:10:24] <DXLelouch24> get it done today
[6:10:25] <DSD24> The knowledge
[6:10:26] <Deko_> brain looking strong
[6:10:26] <andre11dr> I told you we would finish two games today
[6:10:28] <Aussie_Manny> The good one?
[6:10:29] <DianaTheAscian> easier cause knowledge
[6:10:30] <+sevorai> KNAWLEDGE
[6:10:30] <zenith0111> Good Ending is LONGER boss fights
[6:10:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> full of brain
[6:10:36] <T_Sasquatch> @cooldude69xx the mechanic of not doing a takedown is a bit weird
[6:10:41] <Dakuu75> 6 hours went by pretty fast today
[6:10:49] <+EightBitVision> i beat then replayed each boss to spare them before i moved to next boss
[6:10:49] <DSD24> I don't really interpreted the ending we got as a bad one
[6:10:50] <@Solidus_113> you have 17 hours to practice
[6:10:51] <henshin2289> Damn guess no Absolver then sadge
[6:10:54] <Invess> game over yeah
[6:10:57] <cooldude69xx> @T_Sasquatch Game say "no kill" so no kill?
[6:10:58] <yukichocomilk> tutorial over
[6:10:59] <%jinking79> 2 in one done deal
[6:11:01] <DSD24> Its more like a normal ending
[6:11:02] <andre11dr> @dakuu75 Well we did play 2 games today
[6:11:02] <dds333a> @badguy8312 Protag struggles with Yang, and Yang removes the talisman, but protag kills Yang. the protag then sees a vision about Yang and her father, and then breathes a sigh of relief after said vision
[6:11:03] <BlackermanZX> beat bloodborne and technically Sifu today
[6:11:05] <ovejart> tutorial over
[6:11:06] <+JustToWatch> this is where the REAL Sifu begins
[6:11:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> earth shattering revelations
[6:11:19] <zenith0111> @dsd24 You have to look at it with a eastern philosophy
[6:11:22] <PALWolfOS> @t_sasquatch I mean, takedowns aren’t always beneficial anyway - that’s how you activate some enemies’ devil trigger
[6:11:22] <+PkSilent01> Back to the Lab
[6:11:23] <+ArcanumArcanum> There's a new thing on the board Woolie
[6:11:25] <+Comb711> The red hand parries make sean's disciples 1000x easier
[6:11:25] <+EightBitVision> sparing is also perma save
[6:11:26] <VincentGraves> what did woolie discover?
[6:11:26] <%Namillus> It actually makes sense since the game's been telling you not to spam takedowns with the whole 'power up' thing
[6:11:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> No, you're right, they should have been more specific
[6:11:35] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie you should avoid them
[6:11:37] <DSD24> @zenith0111 Oh yeah for sure especially since its talking about Wude
[6:11:41] <skagtheprinceofhell> To have it actually say you can parry
[6:11:46] <+Ornightz> It ain't over yet.
[6:11:52] <PALWolfOS> The wording of the tutorial is technically accurate but misleading
[6:11:55] <+SveriSageAdvice> they should have made it so that there was something to seperate it and make it more obvious, or specified you can parry
[6:11:58] <zenith0111> @dsd24 No idea what Wude means :P
[6:12:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> @VincentGraves Specificity regarding if you can parry glowing attacks
[6:12:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah it seems kinda vague
[6:12:03] <+Rigid_Digidi> I still don't get why they killed you in the beginning. It's hard to sympathize with them.
[6:12:05] <+JustTheGuyYouNeed> It's a secret ending for a reason
[6:12:05] <%RyTYoung> But WHY should we avoid and not PARRY game? Kappa
[6:12:07] <+mechslayer71> I mean... I still figured out I could parry right away tho...
[6:12:13] <skagtheprinceofhell> It's not vauge it's just pushing you towards one way
[6:12:13] <VincentGraves> @Th3SmartAlec ah ok
[6:12:18] <%andrewofbob> Not recommended for scrubs
[6:12:20] <+Parrish_broadnax> "if you're a bad enough dude"
[6:12:26] <+Comb711> My biggest actual complain with this game is it doesn't explain some of it's mechanics too well
[6:12:30] <%jonblnt> Can’t wait for Eldin Ring, I have Yakuza 7 to hold down till then
[6:12:37] <PALWolfOS> @rigid_digidi I imagine they killed you because they killed your dad - easier to get the loose end out of the way
[6:12:37] <+EightBitVision> if i read Mario manual and it said don't jump on enemies, come on... your own fault for playing by the rules lol
[6:12:40] <DSD24> @zenith0111 Its a martial artist mindset I think?
[6:12:47] <dds333a> for the players LUL
[6:12:49] <BearSawed> @mechslayer71 Good for you bradda, we all aint you
[6:12:53] <henshin2289> Granted avoiding guard breaks is the best way to punish, and deflecting only rewards a punish when structure is low enough.
[6:13:08] <andre11dr> @jonblnt 7 more days
[6:13:13] <+sevorai> Explaining things in Layman's terms is so god damn crucial
[6:13:20] <+EightBitVision> if they told you not to kill civilians in gta?? lol
[6:13:34] <cooldude69xx> @PALWolfOS They killed Jane Sifu so she wouldnt come back for revenge. Whoops?
[6:13:46] <PALWolfOS> Kek
[6:13:55] <dds333a> After all, we know how goddamn stupid the consumer can be Kappa (myself Included LUL )
[6:13:59] <+sevorai> The parry into toss combo is disgusting
[6:14:02] <+FoxLex_> Avoiding also gives you stuns
[6:14:07] <Azure_Inc> Especially if you push them toward stairs.
[6:14:07] <zenith0111> @dsd24 From what ive read "The religion of Martial Arts"
[6:14:18] <+FoxLex_> But you need to punish right away to get stuns off dodges

[6:18:59] <dds333a> @linsp Weeks ago Woolz announced that he would play FFVI, and he decided to wait for the Pixl remaster of the game
[6:19:25] <teefpal> This game is way too hard for me, I'm fine watching it
[6:19:28] <zenith0111> NPCs exist in absolver just to lock areas

[6:21:05] <dds333a> I did Karate as a kid, and it was totally a McDojo, since dude had a glass cabinet filled with sharp shit kids should not handle
[6:21:08] <andre11dr> @vincentgraves That game sold like shit and Capcom barely acknowledges it existence
[6:21:12] <zenith0111> Thats the kind of man you run up with a duffel bag bowing your head yelling "Train Me!"
[6:21:22] <T_Sasquatch> Sseth is the only reason why alot of people nowadays even know Godhand.  Its a weird ass ps2 japanese eat em up. I would've never known it would be my fav game of all time if not for sbfp

[6:24:16] <dds333a> Kof XV
[6:24:21] <+mechslayer71> oh ok
[6:24:21] <%Deft_Thought> PC launch always has problems
[6:24:32] <%jinking79> shinz0DantessLUL shinz0DantessLUL shinz0DantessLUL shinz0DantessLUL GO LEO
[6:24:34] <OblivionSword1> apparently the pc version is better according to Max
[6:24:35] <BlackermanZX> like it seems PS5 input delay is super fucked
[6:24:35] <xerotwo> Yep, that's where i'm just waiting for fixes to happen
[6:24:37] <SaiyanShoto> I’ve seen the PC has issues so you gotta fix that and then it runs well so I’d prefer to stay on console
[6:24:39] <DSD24> I'm trying to play Leona in KOF15 and she's tough but fun
[6:24:40] <+SveriSageAdvice> the game feels ultra responsive on PC
[6:24:53] <%Deft_Thought> @SveriSageAdvice Word, that's good to know!
[6:24:57] <+EightBitVision> pc also got mods
[6:25:08] <andre11dr> And it's KOF so you have to react to overheard way more
[6:25:09] <dds333a> @dsd24 very fun, and she used to be a bitch. due to having a BLOATED moveset full of all kinds of shit
[6:25:17] <zenith0111> Dokapon is goated btw
[6:25:24] <dds333a> Legendary
[6:25:30] <+SveriSageAdvice> @SveriSageAdvice legit, gonna go pick up a hitbox because this is the second fighting game that makes me want to play charge characters as a main
[6:25:37] <BlackermanZX> Disco and Dokapon had some bangers
[6:25:38] <dds333a> Dokapon Kingdom is one of my favorites on the channel
[6:25:40] <VincentGraves> dokapon/smt crossover
[6:25:42] <DSD24> @dds333a Charge moves are tough to get used to but still fun
[6:25:48] <zenith0111> I need a Modern Dokapon
[6:25:49] <andre11dr> Dokapon will always be the champion game of this channel
[6:26:00] <%RyTYoung> gigaboOtsOWO
[6:26:00] <zenith0111> Modern Dokapon with 16 players lol
[6:26:03] <%jinking79> Minh pulling out the 2nd and 3rd place ribbon had me dying doodLUL
[6:26:15] <OblivionSword1> finally a battle royale for Woolie
[6:26:18] <dds333a> @jinking79 LUL LUL LUL
[6:26:39] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus also Cross Tag Battle is getting a rollback patch soon. announced today
[6:26:49] <zenith0111> I think its just the fire effects that look bad
[6:26:54] <%Shad0wTag> That art is sadly non negotionable
[6:26:58] <zenith0111> The models look great
[6:27:01] <Blank9> add a cel shade over it
[6:27:07] <dds333a> @shad0wtag I would expect
[6:27:10] <BlackermanZX> just add more normal body shapes
[6:27:13] <T_Sasquatch> Fortnite isn't even a bad artstyle. It's just being copied and associated with Fortnite
[6:27:16] <+N1Special> reminds me of WWE allstars and i loved that game
[6:27:17] <linSP> mobile game art style
[6:27:24] <%Shad0wTag> Its closer to Knockout City
[6:27:36] <%Shad0wTag> That sucks too
[6:27:40] <fangovafang> ripping friends lol damn who else remember dat
[6:27:41] <andre11dr> It definitely has that Mobile game look
[6:27:41] <skagtheprinceofhell> I thought it worked for the wacky feeling of the game.
[6:27:43] <skyshinecrusader> Its nidhogg 2 all over again
[6:27:56] <artoflec> Fuse
[6:28:00] <DSD24> Borderlands?
[6:28:02] <Burdenslo> xenoblade
[6:28:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Sonic the movie Kappa
[6:28:04] <%Irridium> Borderlands?
[6:28:08] <artoflec> wait really?
[6:28:13] <+kewlmyc> Sonic the Hedgehog movie Kappa
[6:28:13] <linSP> nidhogg 2 art was so bad that the decent gameplay suffered for it imo
[6:28:15] <dds333a> YEEYEYEYE
[6:28:16] <+Jiggisnipe> really
[6:28:18] <jetstreamlove_R> Wolf among us?
[6:28:21] <Virokwet> fuse
[6:28:28] <Ipsenscastle> Oh man I wish Fuse had stayed as the thing it was originally announced as
[6:28:31] <dds333a> And they UPPED it
[6:28:33] <jetstreamlove_R> Wolf among us 2 is coming soon
[6:28:36] <artoflec> i had no idea about htat one lol that was new to me
[6:28:40] <dds333a> THEY KILL them
[6:28:41] <Ipsenscastle> Overstrike or whatever
[6:28:46] <VincentGraves> @linSP apparently that was what the devs were aiming for originally, lol
[6:28:48] <+kewlmyc> Blood? For mature adults such as myself
[6:28:55] <andre11dr> And then they made Wind Waker and returned to the chibi shit
[6:28:56] <%Rican20v> oh no wonder i didnt know. it was before my time.
[6:28:58] <%Shad0wTag> Good session!
[6:28:58] <Blank9> it still looked ugly after
[6:29:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> *Splat*
[6:29:05] <%Irridium> man remember when everyone was complaining about Wind Waker's art style so hard they went realistic with Twilight Princess? good times
[6:29:06] <Guigondi> remindsme of the original wind waker
[6:29:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
