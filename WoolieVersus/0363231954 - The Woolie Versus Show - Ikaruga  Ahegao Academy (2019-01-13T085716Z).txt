[0:17:46] <subjectg> rip the 1cc dream
[0:17:53] <+Lunarthewolf> @Shikari21 that's how I feel, I've tried to play this game and my brain just can't deal
[0:17:55] <slyarvicle08> in which console version do you recommend playing ikaruga? @WoolieVersus
[0:18:00] <Truxton_II> It's Treasure's Skyrim. Prove me wrong.
[0:18:04] <$cureneckbeard> Ikaruga is a masterpiece.
[0:18:05] <kaine_west> I'm a believer now, this shits hype
[0:18:08] <jackiedan> stay white!
[0:18:08] <%Rawklobstah88> I wish my brain could operate this game. I can barely handle basic execution in DBFZ, KI, and UNIST
[0:18:11] <%Nmiser> woolieGASM
[0:18:24] <+DevinMayCry> Buy it on Switch and PC at minimum Because why not. Treasure deserves it
[0:18:25] <WG101> NO REFUGE

[0:19:09] <KappaKeepo42069> @DevinMayCry At least you can play all genres. No need to stress over being "the best" at some bloody games but not everybody can be flexible in the games they play
[0:19:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> man, it's lie shmup meets rhythm game
[0:19:17] <Heracross9657> @woolieversus Will You Play Some Kirby After Ikaruga?

[0:19:34] <Truxton_II> @DevinMayCry Me too, but I don't think 3 will happen because Treasure hasn't made a new game since Gaist Crusher killed them
[0:19:37] <StrangeCoincidence> C is passing

[0:20:57] <KappaKeepo42069> @gameaholic42 you get used to it, it gets you less anxious when you play than when you watch
[0:20:59] <+PersonaQueen18> Bullet hell games are legitimately terrifying.

[0:21:28] <UrsulaCat> @WoolieVersus screw kirby after ikaruga play the h-game
[0:21:31] <Addamelech> Danmaku games are almost a zen experience
[0:21:33] <+deathbyace> crazy part of this game is that your hitbox is wayyy smaller than your shit
[0:21:34] <Idon__> LASERS
[0:21:35] <+deathbyace> ship
[0:21:39] <%PoopyDickens> @PersonaQueen18 this was way easier than enter the gungeon imho
[0:21:46] <Addamelech> zone out of the world and concentrate in the patterns
[0:21:46] <+DevinMayCry> OH JEEZ
[0:21:46] <+PersonaQueen18> ???

[0:22:06] <Idon__> THREAD THE NEEDLE
[0:22:06] <$cureneckbeard> I beat it on Dreamcast, but only because after 20 hours you unlock infinite continues
[0:22:09] <%zeroarturia> G
[0:22:09] <oAznoUta> yo the music in this game tho
[0:22:11] <+DevinMayCry> THAT WAS AWESOME
[0:22:15] <FleshFriend> SWEATY HANDS
[0:22:16] <ill_tempered_man> how tf do you do this without hitboxes
[0:22:21] <$SulfurousAcid> perfect
[0:22:35] <FourthQueen> woolie rocking the ginkei? I see you're a man of culture as well
[0:22:42] <$SulfurousAcid> easy every time
[0:22:44] <odd_slater> M O R T I S
[0:23:03] <+PersonaQueen18> Sweaty hands are a sign of victory
[0:23:06] <Man_in_the_Red> the best shmups make the player's hurtbox a single pixel size, we need to remember that
[0:23:08] <%PoopyDickens> this is hurting my head because i'm hyperfocused
[0:23:10] <Idon__> shmups hurt my brain and hands
[0:23:11] <wmeldrum> can't get past stage 2.....
[0:23:12] <WG101> NO REFUGE
[0:23:14] <+Swerto> I'm terrlible at Shmups
[0:23:15] <Calek> my ikaruga runs usually end in stage 2
[0:23:15] <+DevinMayCry> This is one of those perfect games because you have to earn your success. Its peak pride and accomplishment. Cant get past stage 2 yeah
[0:23:15] <$SulfurousAcid> I have it but I haven'r really played it
[0:23:16] <Addamelech> I want to play ikaruga now!
[0:23:16] <hassanico> I can't 1CC this for the life of me
[0:23:16] <mistermastergreg> @WoolieVersus level 2, can't get to 3 yet
[0:23:17] <+mighty_max_t> Never touched it but saw it on the Switch store
[0:23:17] <+CreakySkelly> i bought it but I'm still learning
[0:23:18] <OkamiDude15> is the hit box the pixel in the middle in the ship or is it the whole ship? woopsThink
[0:23:19] <+deathbyace> this boss pieS
[0:23:19] <%ChocolateFlobs> man i feel so dumb for self-imposing opposite polarity runs every time i play as i watch you blaze through it LMAO
[0:23:21] <teflonbilly777> I am terrible at Ikaruga and I own four versions of it
[0:23:21] <%PunishedRaccoon> i played neir so thats my shmup
[0:23:23] <darkseid21> stage 3 is the furthest I got
[0:23:23] <TJW211> can 1cc radiant silvergun
[0:23:23] <+thebonebard> Scrub shmups
[0:23:23] <%PoopyDickens> i beat it twice but with a lot of continues LUL
[0:23:23] <CopperTucker> I played a ton of Ikaruga in the gamecube days
[0:23:24] <+OmegaWeltall> im outta practice but i ulusaly get here on one life
[0:23:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> this is my first time actually seeing ikaruga
[0:23:28] <%DreyfussFrost> I've played but I'm no shmup god. I think I might have beaten level 3 once.
[0:23:28] <digitaldenam> @WoolieVersus I eat so much shit at this game I love it
[0:23:30] <hassanico> @OkamiDude15 pixel in the middle
[0:23:31] <robertoci3> I don't think i'd make it very far, these kind of games make my head hurt LUL
[0:23:31] <ill_tempered_man> I've dabbled in the 2hu, but I can't really get past easy
[0:23:31] <+ChansonNoire> woolie youre not playing the two ships at the same time isnt that the pro strat
[0:23:31] <CopperTucker> I ate shit a lot but it was fun and I was young
[0:23:33] <raminnoodle420> I always eat shit on this game but i still love it so much
[0:23:34] <+OmegaWeltall> this boss fucks me up though
[0:23:34] <+PersonaQueen18> Just looking at this I know i'd be terrible lol
[0:23:36] <+ShiftyFish> The only Shmup I've 1CCed is Eschatos on Easy.
[0:23:37] <%TeethMuncher> I can't play it sober
[0:23:38] <%PinkieTheEerie> i get dumped on, smups are the kinda games i love despire sucking massive balls
[0:23:40] <+JackMillerTime> get some knitted fingerless gloves for those sweaty hands
[0:23:46] <KappaKeepo42069> I've played a few 2hus myself, although I don't have the patience to learn anything beyond Normal mode 1cc, not even Extra stages
[0:23:47] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> YOOO
[0:23:48] <OkamiDude15> @hassanico thought so woopsLUL
[0:23:48] <Addamelech> I usually play 2hu on lunatic so I'd love to play this
[0:23:52] <%PoopyDickens> my ass is clenching from ptsd just watching rn
[0:23:52] <+KyroDragon> yo this game is fucked up
[0:23:53] <Theonlypegsus> @WoolieVersus I played this with my Brother all the time. He was alright at it but I died most the time. Thanks to this though.
[0:23:54] <Superdandy96> Yeah, totally, got to lvl 100 the other day an all(loudly sweats cause I clearly don’t understand what’s going on.)
[0:23:55] <Archangel317> I’ve never actually seen this game before today
[0:23:56] <HefestoForges> !uptime
[0:23:57] <Addamelech> looks tight
[0:23:57] <%homelesstwinky> this music is great
[0:24:00] <teflonbilly777> I got Ikaruga on Dreamcast, Gamecube, 360 and PC, yet I've never finished it. I am a fraud
[0:24:02] <StrangeCoincidence> jesus, this boss
[0:24:04] <Idon__> I how do you even DEAL with this
[0:24:12] <+OmegaWeltall> you learn
[0:24:13] <+KyroDragon> MORTIS
[0:24:13] <StrangeCoincidence> STOP
[0:24:14] <WG101> and then you just beef it
[0:24:16] <%arcturusblade> stage 3 is where the gloves come off, then stage 4 just says "fuck your 1cc run"
[0:24:17] <+lord_ludence> I usually get to about the boss of the 3rd stage if I'm lucky. Usually I get my ass handed to me before then though.
[0:24:23] <Leish> felli8Fatneck
[0:24:23] <HefestoForges> is it getting faster
[0:24:24] <StrangeCoincidence> 2ez
[0:24:25] <dukenux> Ive heard a lot about Ikaruga, this is first time isee someone playing it live
[0:24:29] <TJW211> stage 3 boss is a gate keeper in this game
[0:24:29] <hassanico> As a Touhou player I don't think the experience is comparable, Ikaruga is faster and has a bunch of environmental stuff you gotta dodge like walls and shit
[0:24:30] <%ChocolateFlobs> i play a bunch of the stuff that gets ported to steam, and I'm glad to see more Cave stuff come west through there.
[0:24:31] <+CezrDaPleazr> Woah
[0:24:32] <SuperArson> ikaruga is essentially more of a rhythm game when it comes to the bosses
[0:24:33] <+ShiftyFish> Is this Switch or PC?
[0:24:33] <$cureneckbeard> first try
[0:24:34] <%PoopyDickens> @arcturusblade LUL
[0:24:35] <+botchdogg> Scarlet Devil is the best 2hu to start with.
[0:24:35] <+CezrDaPleazr> sirlioGasm
[0:24:38] <$cureneckbeard> switch
[0:24:38] <dukenux> Switch
[0:24:43] <slowbeef> Switch?!
[0:24:47] <+ogrest> this is it, it's finally happened, I made it in time for a Woolie stream
[0:24:50] <+ShiftyFish> Alright cool.
[0:24:50] <%Nmiser> yeah i've never seen this before either
[0:24:51] <Saberkai> first time seeing this game
[0:24:51] <$megamonmon123> i think its beem recorded that no one has reached the end of ikaruga
[0:24:52] <slowbeef> There’s a switch version?!
[0:24:56] <Saberkai> and holy hell i need to play this
[0:24:58] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> bijBooker
[0:25:01] <+Uniso> So excited to finally see you play a game you have talked about for years!
[0:25:01] <Mangahero18> the Schmup genre in general fills me with dread
[0:25:02] <hassanico> Yeah, stage 5 is a boss rush more or less
[0:25:02] <%Nmiser> The two colors mechanic is really cool
[0:25:03] <%PoopyDickens> any of you who haven't played this should try it, it's pretty intense
[0:25:04] <ScreamLord> MORTIS
[0:25:04] <Addamelech> voyage 1969
[0:25:06] <+ShiftyFish> There are a fair number of Shmups on Switch.
[0:25:06] <Notingles> any Eurojank Schmups around?
[0:25:11] <Man_in_the_Red> switch pot, sold!
[0:25:14] <+Sinoc229> get that eurojank outa here
[0:25:18] <mistermastergreg> this goes on sale for $5 on steam
[0:25:20] <+sewermonk> does switch have a vertical mode?
[0:25:20] <Idon__> Nintendo Switch *snaps fingers*
[0:25:21] <Emdhad> as a first time viewer of ikaruga can anyone let me know the difference between the two colours
[0:25:24] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> vinejoelGranddad vinejoelGranddad vinejoelGranddad
[0:25:25] <+ShiftyFish> Yes.
[0:25:26] <hassanico> The MUSIC! It's so good my ears are melting
[0:25:27] <+Sinoc229> switch has tate yes
[0:25:27] <+PersonaQueen18> Woooooooolieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee u da man.
[0:25:30] <dukenux> Is Jamestown eurojank?
[0:25:30] <%PoopyDickens> 120% BULLSHIT mode activated
[0:25:31] <MrHappyFunshine> Same never played or saw Ikaruga, played shmups when i was a kid but mostly R-Type
[0:25:32] <+TheArrow_> that's my pilot way
[0:25:33] <OkamiDude15> whens woolie gonna do his full lp of astebreed? sfhWOKE
[0:25:34] <Ognjenco> @WoolieVersus Maybe you should check out Zero Ranger, seems like a neat shmup
[0:25:36] <+bread_assassin> Sae. I heard people talking about it for years, but never saw someone actually playing it until now,
[0:25:38] <+Sinoc229> jamestown is suuuper eurojank
[0:25:39] <+Creatorofthearc> It's like if DmC's shitty weapon mechanic was a Schmup
[0:25:40] <$cureneckbeard> If the walls are immune to bullets, why don't they make the ships out of that material
[0:25:41] <dukenux> that's about the only other shmup i can name LUL
[0:25:41] <Mr_Strut> Coward out like a true hero!
[0:25:44] <+griffball13> True Heros hide from battle
[0:25:44] <fluke_LKZ> @Emdhad You have to switch colors to kill and not get damaged by a respective colors
[0:25:49] <+mighty_max_t> Is there any difference between the black bullets & white bullets that you shoot?
[0:25:50] <%ChocolateFlobs> @Emdhad you're immune to same color bullets, and you can switch between the two
[0:25:59] <teflonbilly777> @Emdhad White and black are technically not colors
[0:26:01] <%PoopyDickens> @cureneckbeard will that be answered in the lore? hmmm...
[0:26:09] <TheRectangular> what lore?
[0:26:16] <KappaKeepo42069> Whoa this looks like a lotta bs
[0:26:16] <yoshiunity> My ass gets handed to me with a black and white boot in it.
[0:26:18] <haitakaa> DO COMBO
[0:26:20] <%PoopyDickens> true fraud from exposed
[0:26:20] <anAngryHamster> would a grey ship absorb both colors or be vulnerable to both?
[0:26:21] <+ogrest> @WoolieVersus apply duct tape to shoot button, and forget everything but shield transition timing
[0:26:22] <dukenux> I see black forcefield protects from black bullets and vice versa
[0:26:23] <UrsulaCat> god woolie such a loser
[0:26:24] <mr_slaide> Holy shit it's the Woolie!
[0:26:27] <Notingles> the choke is real
[0:26:30] <SuperArson> you do higher damage to opposite-colored enemies but the game works on a 3-chain system for scoring high
[0:26:32] <digitaldenam> @TheRectangular ikaruga has some deep lore
[0:26:34] <+PersonaQueen18> Nuke it all from orbit.
[0:26:34] <Man_in_the_Red> well the white has blue highlight and the black with red highlisghts, its a color now
[0:26:34] <Addamelech> that looks like one of Kaguya's last words
[0:26:36] <mr_slaide> Woolie is such a loser... I wish I was that cool.
[0:26:43] <SorcererLance> doodBenny doodBenny2 doodBenny3
[0:26:45] <Mangahero18> This game is crazy. Its like the fusion of a hardcore puzzle game and galaga.
[0:26:45] <1MadLadd> COWARD

[0:27:05] <ZizerX> jesus haha
[0:27:08] <AggsMK7> Another one
[0:27:10] <SwindlerOfProgress> I bought this game on Switch looking for a shmup because I liked that aspect of Gungeon, and BOY did I get destroyed.
[0:27:12] <$cureneckbeard> Stage 5 never stops stopping
[0:27:16] <%PoopyDickens> this is a live vietnam flashback
[0:27:16] <Idon__> OH IT DOESN'T STOP
[0:27:19] <scoot_io> I can't do shmups on anything but a keyboard
[0:27:21] <$megamonmon123> is that the real slowbeef?
[0:27:21] <%PinkieTheEerie> as a shmup this dosnt look ahat bad
[0:27:26] <%Solidus_113> When's Tempest 2000? woolieSMUG

[0:27:30] <StrangeCoincidence> MY EYES
[0:27:30] <KappaKeepo42069> lazer spam I'm getting flashbacks to touhou
[0:27:32] <slowbeef> It’s a very good shmup
[0:27:33] <Man_in_the_Red> this seems like something that use the transition frames for something
[0:27:34] <+PersonaQueen18> I would fear anyone who is "good" at this.
[0:27:34] <%homelesstwinky> I thought it would stop woolieGASM
[0:27:37] <b1gboss007> Another one bites the dust
[0:27:39] <+deathbyace> ADAPT EVOLVE
[0:27:40] <+Sinoc229> when's crimson clover
[0:27:41] <Truxton_II> I knew a guy in college who questioned my taste when I told him I really liked the music in Ikaruga, I feel so vindicated now with so many here loving it.
[0:27:41] <HefestoForges> all those rips
[0:27:41] <%Menitta> Is this the Shmup where at some point your ghost from the past helps you
[0:27:42] <WG101> this gives me anxiety
[0:27:44] <Mr_Strut> Oh that's just unfair
[0:27:45] <dukenux> EVOLVE OR DIE
[0:27:51] <haitakaa> don't worry your supposed to die a shit ton in this
[0:27:51] <hassanico> @Menitta That's Gradius V
[0:27:51] <$cureneckbeard> The music in Ikaruga is amazing
[0:27:53] <odd_slater> W O O L I E

[0:31:10] <+lord_ludence> @megamonmon123 You pray
[0:31:11] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Y'know, when Yoko Taro talks about this inspiring him, it really makes him seem EVEN MORE insane than we know he already is

[0:32:11] <zimash> >tfw 2 am but woolie is streaming
[0:32:12] <haitakaa> SMT Synchronicity Prologue has a mechanic that's a reference to Ikaruga color switching
[0:32:13] <StrangeCoincidence> this reminds me of xenosaga
[0:32:14] <Mangahero18> I cant wait for woolie to take on "Ultra WTF OMG This is so HARDMODE"
[0:32:15] <hassanico> We're getting there...

[0:32:55] <hassanico> Honest Man's Death EX
[0:32:55] <dukenux> jesus chroist
[0:32:55] <1MadLadd> There is so much shit in the screen, what the actual fuck is this game SwiftRage
[0:33:01] <slowbeef> God I love this
[0:33:09] <ecksbockstreefitty> This game is great but it ain't no Police Batrider
[0:33:10] <+ogrest> I see this and I want to go, play, some fuckin, deathsmiles, so I can have normal ass normal rules
[0:33:11] <Alseid> VICTORY LAP HUH?
[0:33:19] <%PoopyDickens> this boy is pushing your shit in
[0:33:23] <FleshFriend> victory lap is new lore
[0:33:24] <WonkaThing> raizing > treasure but they're both good
[0:33:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I can't play a bullet hell like this and bother aiming, it's all evasion
[0:33:27] <hassanico> @Alseid The stage, not the boss
[0:33:27] <%Menitta> I guess they never miss huh
[0:33:32] <pillowwasp> First try
[0:33:33] <Leish> felli8Fatneck felli8Fatneck felli8Fatneck
[0:33:38] <+wwwwwww1> how can our eyes be real
[0:33:41] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Why are the final bosses to shmups almost always some sort of weird flesh bound mechanical creature?
[0:33:42] <UrsulaCat> thinking emoji
[0:33:43] <hassanico> We're still in phase 1 btw
[0:33:43] <Emdhad> so according to woolie "anything black takes double damage from white bullets" huh
[0:33:43] <+griffball13> you feel it to don't you
[0:33:43] <%GohanEgret> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:33:44] <+Sinoc229> 'if you're good at video games it's easy
[0:33:44] <+irl_bartender> BULLET HELL BOOOOOOIIIIIIIS PowerUpR DarkMode PowerUpL
[0:33:44] <%PoopyDickens> Kappa
[0:33:49] <%Nmiser> thats pretty cool
[0:33:52] <Truxton_II> Radiant Silvergun reference~
[0:33:53] <SwindlerOfProgress> By comparison, this is super easy.
[0:33:54] <+SaurianCrash> Level Scob
[0:33:54] <saxmastey> THIS VICTORY IS NOT FOR YOU
[0:33:55] <Idon__> Oh wow , now they're tracking
[0:33:56] <+Zero_ELEC> now, 1cc it
[0:34:00] <+NarcissistCactus> just be good 4Head
[0:34:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> RIDE THE SNAKE
[0:34:04] <Superdandy96> Whole ‘nother level, coming from my mind HolidayCookie
[0:34:06] <FleshFriend> it's a trail of tears for us scrubs
[0:34:13] <Man_in_the_Red> does keeping your bar at max power up normal bullets, if not it should
[0:34:13] <teflonbilly777> Honestly, this isn't THAT busy of a screen for a hardcore bullet hell game. As I said earlier, it's just extremely elegantly designed
[0:34:15] <+fatal_penguin_> Is this Slither.io
[0:34:16] <StrangeCoincidence> not the sexy snekk i was expecting
[0:34:17] <speximillian> Use your ENERGY MAX
[0:34:20] <MarianoTekken> i still cant finish donpachi
[0:34:21] <haitakaa> trouser snakes
[0:34:23] <KappaKeepo42069> Woolie says this is easier but he sure is dying a lot more
[0:34:24] <MrSpaceLion> how the hell is this possible without dying!!!
[0:34:28] <Lilgamba> Isn't this, like, infamously difficult?
[0:34:28] <masterfire23> I've only played shmups on mobile LUL
[0:34:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You aren't riding the snake correctly
[0:34:32] <StrangeCoincidence> LITERALLY SLITHERIO
[0:34:35] <+Sinoc229> ikaruga's not realy a bullet hell, it's very reserved
[0:34:41] <b1gboss007> GAMBARE
[0:34:47] <%PoopyDickens> it's hard for me to enjoy this because i really feel like i'm playing
[0:34:49] <StrangeCoincidence> WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
[0:34:50] <+ogrest> this bullshit rattlesnake tactic is, just not right man
[0:34:50] <$megamonmon123> hard but you love it huh?
[0:34:52] <+libbnattin> HI WOLLIE
[0:34:52] <hassanico> STAGE 1 REPRISE
[0:34:53] <Alseid> EMIL?
[0:34:54] <StrangeCoincidence> METAPHYCHOSIS? WHAT
[0:34:54] <Idon__> I have no idea what the hell the plot's trying to say
[0:34:55] <teflonbilly777> @Sinoc229 Yeah, it has more of a puzzle element to it
[0:34:56] <%DreyfussFrost> If you guys think there's a lot of the screen here, go watch Mushihimesama. This is NOTHING.
[0:34:56] <reokie_t7> Yeah this aint touhu but this will still break your balls
[0:34:57] <hassanico> ENERGY MAX
[0:34:57] <%TeethMuncher> Next up, Touhou!
[0:34:57] <pillowwasp> I didn’t know they turned the smash ultimate credits into a full game
[0:34:59] <+fatal_penguin_> "its hard and I love it" -Woolie
[0:34:59] <SwindlerOfProgress> I'm trash at this game, it's OK.
[0:34:59] <+Zero_ELEC> These spell patterns are too easy
[0:35:00] <+OmegaWeltall> man i love this part Kreygasm
[0:35:00] <StrangeCoincidence> OH MY GOD THIS SONG
[0:35:01] <gunsrlove> player us supposed to die
[0:35:02] <+DevinMayCry> This is the coolest part of the game
[0:35:03] <+SaurianCrash> its lss bullet hell and more color hell
[0:35:03] <hassanico> Parry battle!
[0:35:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> When riding the snake, you must lead
[0:35:05] <OozieStream> How the fuck do you beat this normally
[0:35:06] <+Yokuho> It's kind of boring to watch
[0:35:07] <StrangeCoincidence> YOU SAY RUN
[0:35:07] <+DevinMayCry> Is this entire sequence
[0:35:09] <Idon__> just use your bomb
[0:35:12] <haitakaa> there's a really cool free mobile shmup called Bullet Hell Monday
[0:35:14] <$cureneckbeard> energy max
[0:35:15] <Daxalog> "Hey, I do that" - You, to the boss
[0:35:17] <+ogrest> wait are those it's macross bullet barrages?
[0:35:17] <ecksbockstreefitty> touhou or nohou
[0:35:18] <hassanico> ENERGY MAX
[0:35:22] <Reanimator83> I gotta plug my GameCube in and play this again
[0:35:22] <+ogrest> Is this guitar hero or a bullet hell
[0:35:23] <+Sinoc229> this part is the coolest to watch a good player do
[0:35:25] <+ogrest> what even is this
[0:35:25] <Mangahero18> I would kill for an Orchestral Remix of this soundtrack. Who is with me?
[0:35:27] <TrollKing96> Holy shit that life bar.
[0:35:35] <buster7800> if this were an anime the op would be playn right now
[0:35:36] <Mr_Strut> It seems like there's an entire mecha anime leading up to this game that I've never seen.
[0:35:36] <Truxton_II> Fun fact: If you do this part perfectly the music at the beginning syncs up perfectly
[0:35:37] <%LethargicRush> HERE WE GO
[0:35:38] <+SaurianCrash> why can we never counter bullet hell on bosses
[0:35:39] <hassanico> You thought it was over?

[0:37:00] <hassanico> WE DO IT
[0:37:03] <+ogrest> I've never been an advocate for non violence, because not only is violence cool but it makes girls hot under the collar even if they don't like to admit it, but this is the time for ultra violence, not, just dodge and hope for the best ikaruga
[0:37:03] <$megamonmon123> screw this

[0:38:59] <hassanico> @WoolieVersus this game is so freaking sad dude

[0:39:07] <%PoopyDickens> give us dat lore
[0:39:07] <%DreyfussFrost> @generalve Pretty sure that was infinite lives mode, beating it with limited lives is the real challenge, there's side content, and also it's REALLY GOOD.

Quick Question; as you are a connoisseur of comics, what are your thoughts on Jim Sterenko and his artwork? (Nick Fury and Doctor Strange circa 1970s)
[0:39:50] <StrangeCoincidence> Lulu has bigger plot!
[0:39:52] <UrsulaCat> ah, chatterbox

[0:47:32] <UrsulaCat> I don't care if this is dumb I wanna hear your ideas
[0:47:36] <+DevinMayCry> IDEAL: TRIAL: FAITH: REALITY: METEMPSYCHOSIS
[0:47:37] <Man_in_the_Red> hey @WoolieVersus any chance of you playing the second Devil May Cry game: SMT 3 Nocturne on stream
[0:47:38] <+fatal_penguin_> Go ballz deep
[0:47:39] <+ogrest> Of the many paths to enlightenment, the most fun is still the howl of the devil tiger
[0:47:41] <AhegaoAcademy> Sinoc is going to be crushed
[0:47:41] <+DevinMayCry> Those are the chapter names
[0:47:41] <%CubicPhantom> oh god what a gaffe. surely chat will never let you forget this
[0:47:41] <StrangeCoincidence> This is about zennbuddhist maharaja?!
[0:47:42] <UrsulaCat> your beautiful brain ideas
[0:47:42] <%lord_ludence> I've been playing this game for 1 1/2 years on and off and had no idea about the lore wtf it's dope!
[0:47:49] <%DMJohndrow> woolieGASM
[0:47:50] <%PoopyDickens> @DevinMayCry LUL
[0:47:50] <Mangahero18> That Lady is totally Lulu
[0:47:53] <pillowwasp> The laser bullets stand for laser bullets
[0:47:55] <galuda7> We'll never get a third Project RS game (this is RS-2) since Treasure's more or less dead. And they need funding for games.
[0:47:55] <%Menitta> But Devil Engine is super cool
[0:48:01] <OkamiDude15> @DevinMayCry thats a arcysy fight intro if ive ever heard one
[0:48:10] <datmouse> ikaruga Kreygasm
[0:48:10] <ecksbockstreefitty> galuda- I think it would technically go to square enix
[0:48:11] <dukenux> Calm before the storm?
[0:48:12] <+dopeboy_i> yeah go deeper, we ready for all this
[0:48:18] <dukenux> RED
[0:48:24] <StrangeCoincidence> The IDEAL
[0:48:31] <+DevinMayCry> Metempsychosis: the supposed transmigration at death of the soul of a human being or animal into a new body of the same or a different species.
[0:48:43] <galuda7> Yeah, I checked, Enix was the OG publisher, NIntendo just brought it out in America
[0:48:48] <StrangeCoincidence> This is like the scientific method. hypothesis, experiment
[0:48:49] <%TeethMuncher> I'm okay with this impromptu TED talk
[0:48:53] <+SaurianCrash> WOOLIE Vs DEVIL ENGINE! !!
[0:48:59] <+Unregisteredhypercamtwo> you dont just throw around the term "metempsychosis" unless you're up to something
[0:49:01] <DeathGripsSan> has he like, played the game yet?
[0:49:05] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Oh hey its the Woolie
[0:49:10] <galuda7> meanwhile, Sin & Punishment 3 NEVER, since Nintendo owns that IP and S&P2 didn't do so well because the average Wii owner didn't like challenging games. Kappa
[0:49:14] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Hello
[0:49:16] <slix3431> Yes, philosophy is half the game now
[0:49:17] <JumbleJams> yes he's alreasy played
[0:49:22] <UrsulaCat> "moving forward in some direction" you idiot the only way forward is forward
[0:49:22] <AhegaoAcademy> We totally didn't show the clip of Devil Engine hype to the developer and make him happy.
[0:49:31] <AhegaoAcademy> That we now get to take back from him.
[0:49:32] <%PoopyDickens> 4 tests your faith more than this
[0:49:44] <Mangahero18> The game is done. This is Mr Madden's Story Time.
[0:49:46] <Bennett_Fracture> do you think a ikaruga character would fit in the smash brothers cinematic universe...
[0:49:47] <StrangeCoincidence> Ideal to reality, hmmmmmm
[0:49:52] <ecksbockstreefitty> So what you're telling me Galuda..... is Marina could be in small ultimate hapJoy
[0:49:58] <Bennett_Fracture> or am i getting ahead of myself here...
[0:49:59] <joylent_blue> reality is difficult its true FeelsBadMan
[0:50:01] <galuda7> oddly enough, stage 4 is easier than stage 3 on easy mode, but yeah, the hardest of the bunch on normal
[0:50:11] <ecksbockstreefitty> smash*
[0:50:12] <KappaKeepo42069> FeelsBadMan TOO REAL
[0:50:14] <dukenux> SNAP! back to reality
[0:50:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Clownface or cockpit?
[0:50:20] <StrangeCoincidence> we should really be having this conversation in a parked car in between classes
[0:50:24] <+OmegaWeltall> yea.. too real FeelsBadMan
[0:50:30] <b1gboss007> Why is woolie going full metal gear villan?
[0:50:34] <+ApocalypticExpress> @galuda7 I like how apparently Treasure originally made it like fairly hard anbd then a nintendo tester played it with wii remote cursor and said "It's too easy, make it harder," or so I recall
[0:50:35] <slix3431> Ok to be fair to Woolie, the names of the levels is a good place to build this idea on
[0:50:37] <+TxukasaVersus> Woolieeeeee : D
[0:50:39] <+ogrest> The only way to fix reality is to assign everyone a cloned adorable imouto cyborg to help make life suck less.
[0:50:40] <+fatal_penguin_> The reality that hot cheetos will give you tummy rumbles
[0:50:41] <+SirIntrovert> Dang Woolie.... atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:50:43] <%lord_ludence> Woolie I honestly don't think you're up your own ass, this theory is super great!
[0:50:47] <haitakaa> i was not prepared for this Woolie
[0:50:49] <+WhyIDie> or a third option, you can cheat
[0:50:52] <b1gboss007> Memes the dna of the soul
[0:50:56] <galuda7> wouldn't surprise me, Apoc
[0:50:57] <hassanico> METEMPSYCHOSIS
[0:50:57] <%Menitta> This is the inspiration of Woolie Will Figure It Out
[0:50:59] <+thebonebard> I bet Shinra is constantly in a state of butt clenching terror
[0:51:02] <StrangeCoincidence> METEMPSYCHOSIS
[0:51:03] <+DevinMayCry> I don't believe in god but I do believe in Ikaruga.
[0:51:09] <%ChoculaUltra> You must [not] bail.
[0:51:16] <dukenux> PSYCHO MANTIS?
[0:51:21] <+OmegaWeltall> dawg i've had these same ideas man
[0:51:22] <+edibleskeleton> *hits blunt*
[0:51:25] <+Sinoc229> lore deeper than mario brothers
[0:51:26] <KappaKeepo42069> AngelThump
[0:51:26] <+fatal_penguin_> The Nomad Wandering Soul
[0:51:30] <+DevinMayCry> They arent unique
[0:51:31] <galuda7> Woolie, played Radiant Silvergun by chance?
[0:51:31] <OkamiDude15> you must [not] give up
[0:51:32] <AlexStAdams> I personally would like to read Woolie's literature
[0:51:39] <%humbelpie> I made it what did i miss?
[0:51:45] <%akuda_bar> this is the last time i audit a class before i take the introductory level
[0:51:48] <dukenux> So the aim of Ikaruga is to reach Nirvana?
[0:51:48] <Doodle_Taco> This is some deep st7ff
[0:51:52] <Idon__> Wait, what was the ending. How did he blow up?
[0:51:53] <%AntithesisEK> Woolie vs Nirvana
[0:51:54] <%robobeau> Shin Megami Tensei also roughly translates to "True Goddess Metempsychosis"
[0:51:55] <honmaheadbutt> You could say you REBOOT
[0:51:58] <seylumiue> @humbelpie one run at the game, then lore dump
[0:52:00] <OkamiDude15> woolie just did his run of ikaruga and is talking about the lore of ikaruga @humbelpie
[0:52:04] <+JackMillerTime> I love this
[0:52:04] <Doodle_Taco> No regratz!!
[0:52:11] <%Nmiser> no regerts
[0:52:16] <%PoopyDickens> ME NOT REGERT SMOrc
[0:52:17] <galuda7> he blew up because releasing enough stored energy to destroy the Stone-Like was also what destroyed his own ship
[0:52:18] <mercado94> aw shiet
[0:52:20] <+Yokuho> !uptime
[0:52:21] <digitaldenam> @WoolieVersus *leaves to play dodonpachi*
[0:52:23] <dukenux> Stone Freeeeee
[0:52:29] <OthoZen> Howdy folks
[0:52:30] <galuda7> still a happier ending than Radiant Silvergun had. BibleThump
[0:52:33] <+DevinMayCry> They overload the ship or something to destroy the invincible being with the cost of their lives or something
[0:52:37] <+Yokuho> sbfpSetIn
[0:52:39] <Bennett_Fracture> in the context of video game playing off-course...
[0:52:39] <AlexStAdams> The Stone Buddha
[0:52:42] <zoranbiocic> thought this game was about black and white dots?
[0:52:42] <%TeethMuncher> Wasn't metempsychosis Pucci's plan in Jojo 6?
[0:52:44] <StrangeCoincidence> you must defeat stubbornness?
[0:52:45] <%humbelpie> Wait Ikaruga has a plot? I thought the only bullet hell with plot is the Touhou series
[0:52:47] <b1gboss007> NotLikeThis
[0:52:52] <bigboy3d> It's like a Zen game. Mastering Ikaruga is reaching enlightenment
[0:52:58] <%PoopyDickens> i'm the unstoppable force tho
[0:53:03] <+OmegaWeltall> yea Ikaruga lore is some deep shit
[0:53:04] <+DevinMayCry> Hell yeah you are
[0:53:12] <Idon__> row row, fight the power
[0:53:13] <DeebzNutz100> RedTeam doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[0:53:15] <hassanico> @WoolieVersus And the StoneLike itself shit talks you and tells you you can't escape the cycle
[0:53:18] <galuda7> humbelpie - go look up the plots for some Cave shooters. particularly the Dodonpachi and Mushihimesama series'.
[0:53:21] <SuperArson> there's quite a few shmups with pretty solid story but ikaruga is very deep in terms of lore
[0:53:22] <signofzeta> Both can lose tho
[0:53:26] <slix3431> The alternate theory is just get in the fucking mecha right?
[0:53:29] <Mangahero18> I thought the plot of Touhou was 'Hey look at these Waifu'
[0:53:30] <SuperArson> dodonpachi is good tho
[0:53:30] <StrangeCoincidence> OH MY GOD WOOLIE WAS RIGHT
[0:53:30] <galuda7> in RSG, the Stone-Like is more or less God.
[0:53:32] <UrsulaCat> enlightenment
[0:53:36] <+SPKTR34> came for bullet hell and I ended up on existencial hell, thanks @WoolieVersus
[0:53:39] <ecksbockstreefitty> Ikaruga: No R[E]gret
[0:53:40] <+ogrest> I like it
[0:53:43] <Jashter18> Well yeah when faced with God you first instinct is to punch him in his face
[0:53:49] <KappaKeepo42069> That's a solid analysis
[0:53:49] <+deathbyace> EX Clap
[0:53:52] <megajohnny> also the stone-like has a time loop in-universe, which you kinda break in ikaruga, right?
[0:53:53] <joylent_blue> but thats just a.... WOOLIE THEORY
[0:53:53] <%PoopyDickens> this isn't that deep, kinda just buddhism-lite LUL
[0:53:54] <Belutima> @ecksbockstreefitty give this man a medal
[0:54:01] <%lord_ludence> Woolie its a fucking great headcannon. I'm down with it.
[0:54:02] <ShreddingPixels> I liked your ted talk
[0:54:02] <+DevinMayCry> This is why Ikaruga is peak game design. The layers of gameplay and simplicity make it like a Tetris tier game of constant improvement
[0:54:03] <UrsulaCat> woolie I can't make fun of you I am 10 x worse
[0:54:04] <TungstenViper> this game has an amazing philosophy
[0:54:04] <bignerb> your... game theory?
[0:54:04] <+bread_assassin> But it's just a theory a Game Theory.
[0:54:07] <+JackMillerTime> naw thats what it is even if someone tells me its not
[0:54:07] <GeneralResource> there's a ton of shmups out there where the story revolves around death and rebirth
[0:54:07] <+fatal_penguin_> Deep in the booty
[0:54:07] <AlexStAdams> has woolie ever looked hotter?
[0:54:08] <GoldeNOVA> Ikaruga Lore when
[0:54:09] <+mighty_max_t> Oh yeah, you interested in the DOA6 Beta Woolie?
[0:54:11] <+NarcissistCactus> sick religion
[0:54:12] <scoot_io> shmup lore is the best
[0:54:12] <rindenauge> i always play shmups for the story
[0:54:13] <teflonbilly777> Ikaruga is Woolie's true religion
[0:54:16] <Man_in_the_Red> you ARE up your own ass but i'll climb in there too LUL
[0:54:16] <+Unregisteredhypercamtwo> Ikaruga visits the pope
[0:54:16] <+thebonebard> you really are plagues friend
[0:54:19] <%Knopantz> Ok but how do we get Zubaz in there?
[0:54:19] <+WhyIDie> art is meant to be appreciated inside your own ass though, and ikaruga is art
[0:54:20] <%CubicPhantom> you're not completely up your own ass. just like a little bit inside that sphincter
[0:54:21] <%AntithesisEK> Woolie vs. Devaloka
[0:54:21] <FleshFriend> HARD MODE
[0:54:22] <UrsulaCat> @hard_bop_sax_solo he did when I saw him in person at magfest
[0:54:23] <DeebzNutz100> @WoolieVersus You ever Thunder force 4?
[0:54:23] <galuda7> According to the lead developers/directors at Treasure, Radiant Silvergun is about being caught in a cycle, while Ikaruga is about breaking the cycle.
[0:54:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> woolieREMEMBERS
[0:54:26] <b1gboss007> The virgin nier vs the chad ikaruga

[0:54:35] <+NarcissistCactus> word from our sponsors
[0:54:36] <Man_in_the_Red> soooooo.... @WoolieVersus ... any chance you'll play the second Devil May Cry game: SMT 3 Nocturne.
[0:54:41] <%Menitta> two controllers
[0:54:43] <+DevinMayCry> Cause you could beat the game after working really hard but beating it with emphasis on your combo? Fuck man. You gotta spend 10,000 hours for that.
[0:54:46] <lich995> Glad to see you landing on your feet my man
[0:54:47] <+VanaSkiller> up Woolie's ass? THE TRUE WOOLIE HOLE
[0:54:49] <TungstenViper> is this the same guy that designed Cowby bebop's mechas?
[0:54:50] <saxmastey> So what other Schmups do you recommend?
[0:54:53] <%Menitta> Ey Pinkie
[0:54:53] <%Nmiser> 2 player?
[0:54:58] <Idon__> Nocturne's my favorite JRPG. I hope he plays it sometime.
[0:54:59] <StrangeCoincidence> lmao
[0:54:59] <galuda7> 2player mode can be done on 1 controller now. sort of like the Raiden games had.
[0:55:01] <%yuribo26> LUL
[0:55:01] <slix3431> Woolie will have plenty of reasons to fight me

[0:55:05] <galuda7> been that way since the 360 port.
[0:55:08] <%Menitta> Oh yeah I forgot about that
[0:55:09] <+ogrest> @WoolieVersus doesn't your summation of this game technically make Xenogears the liner notes for the plot of Ikaruga?
[0:55:13] <dadonpachi> anything but ikapooga
[0:55:15] <%Menitta> Nah it was 3S
[0:55:16] <%CubicPhantom> I appreciate this man's moxy

[0:55:38] <%PoopyDickens> my favorite game isn't competitive :)
[0:55:38] <honmaheadbutt> Oh god it is Xenogears
[0:55:40] <Graxe_> What if their favorite game is not the game their good at?

[1:04:35] <%DreyfussFrost> Yeah, what trips up must shmup newbies and people that don't play them at all is seeing the projectiles as static but they're not. You need to look at the paths the projectiles are one and visualize the invisible lines they're following. Once you can visualize the lines, you can also visualize the gaps, and you just stay inside the gaps.

[1:08:31] <jackiedan> Ahhh nuts woolie, your katamari lp released a new episode 11 minutes ago, I wanna watch it, but I want Ikaroogies
[1:08:39] <mr_slaide> Listen to Woolie and all his science mumbo jumbo bullshit.
[1:08:46] <+ogrest> @Deft_Thought oof
[1:08:56] <ahalfeatenchocolateorange> "masters" and "we", huh? then no death run, mr. master.
[1:09:10] <+fatal_penguin_> I get this Woolie, but what does this have to do with chemicals
[1:09:11] <+zaworldo> "The stronger will you have" "The more you face various trials" "Although you can choose to escape" "TRIAL" has the message for you to conquer yourself @WoolieVersus
[1:09:14] <+Unregisteredhypercamtwo> this is the only level I've done dot eater on
[1:09:18] <+ogrest> @jackiedan do, Ikakkumons then watch the kittymario
[1:09:44] <+Unregisteredhypercamtwo> someone I know said it couldnt be done on this stage, so I had to prove them wrong
[1:09:51] <scoot_io> We need that monk from Gamecenter CX to teach us about Ikaruga
[1:09:55] <+zaworldo> Yo trial's shounen as fuck

[1:10:36] <FuqBoiSlim> if the only shump I've played was the credit roll at the end of classic mode in smash ult, which game would be a good starting point?
[1:10:37] <+manwithboxonhead> PeteZarollOdyssey
[1:10:49] <GeneralResource> woolie, odds of you just playing zeroranger again in this stream? OpieOP
[1:11:01] <%DreyfussFrost> Your willpower is not your offense, it's your defense.
[1:11:03] <+Unregisteredhypercamtwo> it is to lose and not surrender
[1:11:05] <+TopTieramisu> the dark souls philosophy
[1:11:07] <GeneralResource> cause that also has a lot of the stuff you're talking about in it
[1:11:07] <jackiedan> @FuqBoiSlim Unironically, the shmup sections of Nier Automata

[1:11:21] <speximillian> "Embracing Failure" sounds pretty accurate to Woolie, honestly.
[1:11:24] <GoldeNOVA> Is this a live "Woolie Will Figure it Out?" Kappa
[1:11:24] <+ogrest> This principal of never giving up is why vivec won't fight you willingly in morrowind, because he knows you're save scumming your fights with him
[1:11:27] <digitaldenam> @FuqBoiSlim this I guess, maybe try some Cave games if you're feelin frisky
[1:11:27] <+Afterman_> Failure is the first step to victory.

[1:12:28] <hassanico> NICE
[1:12:30] <nwordscissorhands_> This whole game is about going on a suicide mission and being really hype about it

[1:15:29] <haitakaa> even though it may seem like it there is no such thing as an unstoppable force in this universe

[1:16:15] <Golgo16> Only played this on the 360, but I loved it to bits (and never got super good at it)
[1:16:16] <AThing_> @Doodle_Taco there are several ways to interpret that m8 and one of them you definitely don't want
[1:16:22] <alloftheworld_1> "Always penetrate kids" OR "Always penetrate, kids" 🤔
[1:16:32] <UrsulaCat> phrasing
[1:16:34] <albret__einstrong> hold shift for focus movement

[1:28:13] <haitakaa> Reincarnate as an anal bead
[1:28:18] <+ogrest> @UrsulaCat have you considered that, perhaps, being like this is why you feel an infinity for cats, and names like ursula?
[1:28:23] <RoboXGP> i have this on gamecube still ha
[1:28:28] <+JoeJotaro> apatDab apatDab
[1:28:30] <%GohanEgret> this game is an reenactment of what sperm goes through to get to that egg

[1:29:06] <+combomaniaex> wait final chapter already
[1:29:06] <hassanico> Translation: "And then the Karma will go back To the will it belonged to before, And will shake awake the First One, The first conscious being still present At the deepest corner of one's memories. And so, the Ikaruga departs..."
[1:29:06] <ravereview84> This game is cool
[1:29:23] <olive_js> so THAT'S what's in the basement
[1:29:28] <TungstenViper> Karma is eternal and omnipresent. you return to the genesis to understand your place. Thus you keep going forward
[1:29:36] <UrsulaCat> Look I'm just a dumb fangirl because I'm thirsty
[1:29:47] <%CubicPhantom> well yeah but that phrase links all those like a boggle tournament

[1:31:19] <TungstenViper> "I made you so that you could walk on the right path. Can you bare that knowledge?"

[1:44:29] <+manwithboxonhead> 3 ice creams
[1:44:29] <+Scevda> Hey, just stopping by as per my sbf contract
[1:44:31] <ravereview84> Woolie commentates on gaming
[1:44:32] <+clack14> This is zen
[1:44:40] <jotabranded> this is so cool
[1:44:42] <b1gboss007> 3 Kreygasm
[1:44:44] <UrsulaCat> I on't play video games so I on't feel any gamer stress
[1:44:46] <lvllvl9> I'm trash at these games, other than ETG

[1:45:31] <+drabberfaun535> why is woolie playing the intro to nier automata again?
[1:45:35] <+DevinMayCry> Chaining makes the lock on lasers MUCH harder to use
[1:45:42] <+filthy_arv> hey @WoolieVersus I just got out of basic training for the army to find out that SBFP broke up, just wanna say I still love you guys youre the best
[1:45:58] <$cureneckbeard> Why don't they build the ships out of whatever those invulnerable red boxes are made from
[1:46:12] <+full_cowl> smokin sexy style
[1:46:22] <+SaurianCrash> he is using the shield change so much
[1:46:30] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> So is the idea of this game not even to dodge bullets, just accept that you're gonna get hit?
[1:46:41] <%akuda_bar> @filthy_arv grats!
[1:46:42] <Daxalog> !!FRAUD!!
[1:46:52] <UrsulaCat> uwwwwwu swexy
[1:47:06] <speximillian> Accept that you'll get hit, but absorb the good hits and return fire.
[1:47:13] <+SergeEXE> If This Game seems dope to you guys, check out STG Weekly
[1:47:14] <%GohanEgret> get outta here bot

[1:47:24] <Daxalog> Why are bots getting Turbo now?
[1:47:33] <%akuda_bar> makes them seem trustworthy
[1:47:38] <%akuda_bar> woolie needs a moob bot

[1:47:56] <roseshrimp> akuda why would you want a bot to post moobs
[1:47:58] <%Solidus_113> or some active mods
[1:47:58] <TungstenViper> great player
[1:48:01] <KaizaMcBold> where is my team ikaruga, the Blackout KevinTurtle PogChamp
[1:48:08] <Daxalog> ragebot wants us to fend for ourselves to get stronger.
[1:48:08] <%Billyuppercut0> Solid play
[1:48:10] <+BonzoBeanMachine> huh?
[1:48:12] <gustavozxd> damn I've never seen this game look cool like this
[1:48:13] <Idon__> nah, just a bot fishing for clicks
[1:48:14] <+TopTieramisu> is @teremuduw a bot?
[1:48:14] <AggsMK7> Nani?
[1:48:15] <+ogrest> How does pat ever feel challenged by shmups if he can just fucking utterly trivialize them like this
[1:48:15] <+VariantX7> Brain cant process this game even a decade later
[1:48:15] <Belutima> a bot with a weird lin @WoolieVersus
[1:48:15] <AhegaoAcademy> Ragebot should be brought to WoolieVs
[1:48:18] <+cherokee2391> I wonder how much time he put in
[1:48:23] <Emdhad> remember when you could fight Rage in the chat
[1:48:25] <+DevinMayCry> Makes the bullet limit mode not seem so crazy now seeing the control this player has
[1:48:27] <UrsulaCat> !challengerage
[1:48:28] <+OmegaWeltall> wait there's a chat? i was just looking at some good ass Ikagura

[1:49:18] <@SoushinSen> You'll regret for saying that!
[1:49:19] <+DevinMayCry> Theres a TASbot run of this in 2 player mode thats absurd

[1:53:37] <%Klefth> I've always sucked HORRIBLY at shmups, so looking at this is incredible
[1:53:39] <roseshrimp> ITS NOT MY BIRTHDAY
[1:53:40] <digitaldenam> LUL
[1:53:42] <+Dova573> but its red and blue?
[1:53:44] <roseshrimp> WOOLIE WILL TELL YOU HE KNOWS

[1:53:46] <%Totally_Not_Toby> T A K E O U T T H E B L A C K
[1:53:52] <wirblewomble> @daxalog oh lord I can't imagine a shmup on the ds.
[1:54:03] <+DevinMayCry> You can earn extra lives. Thats encouraging for my hopes of getting any score up someday
[1:54:08] <Flunkorg> @Klefth Btw, this is on normal. Theirs harder difficulty modes
[1:54:09] <+thebonebard> race traitor woolie strikes again
[1:54:10] <MelBrooksKA> @DeebzNutz100 Why not multi twitch, then you can just look back and forth between the left and right boob spyCappa
[1:54:12] <TungstenViper> BIG OOF
[1:54:24] <scoot_io> I'm glad we've finally moved on from the never ending ball jokes with this game
[1:54:34] <+DevinMayCry> This is dog fighting in 2d and its impressive
[1:54:35] <Daxalog> @wirblewomble The shooting was on the top screen and weapon choice and bomb use was the bottom screen (optionally)
[1:54:38] <UrsulaCat> now it's just the race jokes
[1:54:40] <DeebzNutz100> @MelBrooksKA Mmmm... boobs
[1:54:44] <+lyfeindeyth> What? Woolie, stop playing such awesome games, this is very unexpected D:
[1:54:45] <gustavozxd> I heard this game fucks you on easy
[1:54:58] <TungstenViper> He understands the pattern well
[1:55:04] <mylesmoore> would rather watch this than watch the remaining 4 hours of people shouting ORB
[1:55:05] <+SpamKingRathalos> hype
[1:55:08] <MutedMimic> Kreygasm
[1:55:08] <datmouse> Kreygasm
[1:55:12] <+clack14> Kreygasm
[1:55:14] <SwindlerOfProgress> I mean, it seems simple enough looking at it, but actually understanding what's going on is different.
[1:55:14] <+HauntingHALO06> this is giving me anxiety
[1:55:19] <Belutima> I can slowlsy see the patern.... I understand what he was trying to do
[1:55:44] <+3344> i only just realised woolie wasnt controlling
[1:55:44] <UrsulaCat> @HauntingHALO06 don't worry you aren't playing this game. you don't need to pay attention too hard
[1:55:54] <%buttdirt> this guy would make a perfect hockey goalie with the reflexes that he has, jesus fucking christ
[1:56:02] <%lord_ludence> If this seems simple play the game.
[1:56:05] <DeebzNutz100> some say White/Black I always saw Blue/Red
[1:56:14] <SwindlerOfProgress> It's OK, that's more or less what I meant.
[1:56:19] <FuqBoiSlim> you need a hi IQ to really get ikaruga
[1:56:20] <%Explodincatz> we dont even know
[1:56:35] <datmouse> I wonder how hard this gets in co-op
[1:56:38] <%AntithesisEK> no refuge
[1:56:39] <+NarcissistCactus> some say kosm
[1:56:39] <Doodle_Taco> This is what normal people experience when the smart anime character does something
[1:56:40] <MutedMimic> Ill explode
[1:56:42] <+kevinr220> 2deep4me. I should get back to playing this.
[1:56:43] <gwbtoast> You have to be REALLY quick with those switches of color
[1:56:45] <Hotironclad> I played the game, I was scared to death to just survive
[1:56:47] <$cureneckbeard> NO REFUGE
[1:56:54] <TungstenViper> @WoolieVersus you gotta avoid + shoot + change + chain + absorb and then inverse everything
[1:56:56] <UrsulaCat> don't let girls see you drop combos
[1:57:00] <speximillian> So this is Liam playing?
[1:57:07] <+digitaljeff> OUT FUCKING SKILLED

[1:57:53] <Cthulos> Is this PS4?
[1:57:54] <+HardboiledBoi> Operation is the US version
[1:57:58] <+VorpalMatt> to be fair you need a really high iq in order to understand ikaruga. the gameplay is very subtle, and without a solid grasp of color theory most of the patterns will go over a typical gamer's head.
[1:58:00] <ArkhamG> my dude, this is so hard to pull
[1:58:07] <digitaldenam> @Cthulos switch
[1:58:13] <$Chatterbox1991> Back
[1:58:14] <odd_slater> @Cthulos Yeah

[1:58:43] <odd_slater> He's playing on Switch

[1:58:57] <+TopTieramisu> to this guy
[1:58:57] <+HeathCottengim> balanced for yawn
[1:59:04] <digitaldenam> @Cthulos he isn't playing right now
[1:59:20] <alloftheworld_1> "You're saying I can dodge bullets?" "When you're good enough, you won't have to."
[1:59:20] <Cthulos> I have it on Switch, that 3D rumble is neat

[3:09:52] <@akuda_bar> you downloaded the art after ch 0, obviously
