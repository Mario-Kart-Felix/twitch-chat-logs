[0:06:42] <WG101> you picked gamgams last session
[0:06:42] <$RilsRislan> It knows what you've read.

[0:07:19] <+fatal_penguin_> "What do you do know when two girls come up to you offering a Threesome?"
[0:07:28] <RyuuAoi> You gon get probed
[0:07:32] <$RilsRislan> It's very similar to 999, it won't skip anything you've never seen, but the choices did reset.
[0:07:35] <%Doodle_Taco> L O A D
[0:07:50] <Ropcord> 🤔
[0:07:51] <$RilsRislan> It's called Perpetual Data

[0:10:04] <%UrsulaCat> there are some people who prefer a kind lie
[0:10:08] <MyNameIsRasus> It's about the nickname Joko

[0:41:12] <+StromkoPenguin> Oh Triangle Girl, why can't you be the True Path
[0:41:13] <+HDmexiqtioner> The west is where the term "Riding Shotgun" came in too. When riding in a carriage carrying passengers or goods, there was someone driving the cart and someone guarding the cart with a shotgun against bandits. Shotguns were used because of the spread of the shot. So with that, the person in the passenger seat is known as "shotgun". @WoolieVersus

[0:46:27] <%GohanEgret> Woolie colluded with Warner Bros Kappa
[0:46:29] <MatTrix77> President of Anime Country
[0:46:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Woolie, Prince of the Animators
[0:46:31] <JinjaBredMan> El presidente de animu

[0:47:14] <The_Blumper> Was there a department of Defense also like why are you starting mini governments?
[0:47:16] <@mothmandraws> woolie killed that dude to take control of the anime club
[0:47:17] <%UrsulaCat> I was on the project for like a couple hours before I gave up. I'm like a dev
[0:47:17] <+Troispoint> Wool eliminated his rivals by exposing their loli folders
[0:47:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alternatively, you can become president with overwhelming military force
[0:47:21] <RyuuAoi> Should have been a fighting tournament for Prez.
[0:47:22] <$konekoryugamine> So, anyone seen The Promised Neverland?
[0:47:23] <AMajorTom> Was there a qualification test cover many anime topics
[0:47:25] <MyNameIsRasus> As soon as Woolie brought his DVD of Ninja Scroll everyone agreed he hqd to be president
[0:47:27] <%VyperVic> Woolie is big, tall, and strong. ain't no weeb gonna challenge him
[0:47:27] <$konekoryugamine> Anyone seen the Promised Neverland?
[0:47:29] <DonatelloJose> people tend to shy away from director roles.
[0:47:32] <@akuda_bar> the telepathy is real here because i had no idea he was in this club until this week
[0:47:42] <%Eaglestrike117> I stole the shit for chapter 1, so techncally im a dev
[0:47:44] <@mothmandraws> we never had clubs at out school
[0:47:46] <dukenux> Woolie could do the best Naruto run, so he was elected
[0:47:47] <%UrsulaCat> woolie is super yomi-able

[0:58:15] <GarettLefebvre> have you heard of that kickstarter game; now on Steam that is a Shadow of the Collosus tribute

[0:58:31] <HitchhikingThrough> @Doodle_Taco I wanted to test my abilities
[0:58:33] <@akuda_bar> pretty sure i didnt know
[0:58:37] <$konekoryugamine> @WoolieVersus I pretty much was in anime club. If you wanna see my shame, look at my donation I made a moment ago.
[0:58:37] <$RilsRislan> It was a surprise to me
[0:58:38] <Laecerelius> First time I heard you talk about it was during the Katamari Damacy playthrough
[0:58:38] <roseshrimp> hm
[0:58:40] <Laecerelius> With Reggie
[0:58:42] <%GingaNZ> all of us know 10% of the lore, but there is lots of us
[0:58:43] <RyuuAoi> Never, Woolie. NEVER
[0:58:45] <gps309> the deepest lore
[0:58:47] <%UrsulaCat> @WoolieVersus people don't listen to podcasts loser
[0:58:50] <$RilsRislan> You may have talked about it, but never admitted to being THE PRESIDENT or being involved
[0:58:54] <MyNameIsRasus> akuda confimed fake fan Kappa
[0:58:54] <gunstar73> I didn’t know and I’ve watched a lot of your shit
[0:58:54] <+phatmac16> He's talked about it
[0:58:55] <%Erzaal> Akuda is scary for not knowing
[0:58:56] <%UrsulaCat> ur stinky podcast
[0:58:58] <+Leon_Spencer> you did but no real stories from it just in passing
[0:59:01] <alrobot2014> woolie's stand [SUPER BEAST] causes the lore to permeate all that observe him within his domain
[0:59:02] <%Rezca> I didn't know he was PRESIDENT of it either
[0:59:02] <Mr_Strut> woolie the liar strikes again
[0:59:06] <%Menitta> SBFP is why I respect Metroid Prime 2 Echoes

[1:30:01] <HitchhikingThrough> That's great, because that isn't a community joke, a bunch of people must have gone and done it individually
[1:30:05] <$RilsRislan> There's the split.
[1:30:11] <$RilsRislan> [dab]
[1:30:16] <$Tuskor13> @spardanwarrior wait wasnt the fyre festival guy just bad at planning and gave himself too little time and promised too much or was he actually trying to be scumbag

[1:31:08] <HitchhikingThrough> @SpamKingRathalos not if you do it 24/7
[1:31:14] <$RilsRislan> It loops fine, that one was a command
[1:31:16] <vierleger> @Tuskor13 there's a point where overselling your ability, in the hope that things will just "come together" or "work out" becomes actual criminal negligence.
[1:31:20] <$RilsRislan> It told it to play again

[2:39:30] <MayorRev> its "I didn't do it"
[2:39:37] <HitchhikingThrough> and we run it into THE FUCKING GROUND
[2:39:43] <GarettLefebvre> Pacific Rim - Reset the clock
[2:39:47] <Flarepulse> multiple MONTHS
[2:39:47] <AmericanaRed> more like the simpson
[2:39:48] <%Solidnick18> FeelsGoodMan
[2:39:51] <HitchhikingThrough> 3 MONTHS
[2:39:55] <$RilsRislan> He has to explain so much.
[2:39:57] <AmericanaRed> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:39:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hey guys, remember THE GAME?
[2:40:01] <%Solidnick18> IT'S DEEEEEEEP
[2:40:01] <+SuichiTanaka> The best part of this is just Woolie trying to explain lore.
[2:40:02] <$RilsRislan> I love it
[2:40:03] <+PenmanLupine> 9 years worth of Lore
[2:40:04] <%king_wragles> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:40:04] <%UrsulaCat> woolie imagine how I feel explaining it
[2:40:05] <@Solidus_113> SAY THE LINE
[2:40:05] <%Doodle_Taco> WOOLIE IS IMPLODING
[2:40:05] <@mothmandraws> how deep is the lore
[2:40:08] <%GohanEgret> @GarbageQueenEllie DAMN IT
[2:40:09] <+rdark_ksu> thats what makes it great
[2:40:10] <Prevot> deep lore is best lore
[2:40:12] <HitchhikingThrough> ITS SO GOOD
[2:40:13] <+JRodJames> @GarbageQueenEllie Technically, most people are winners. So were more unique for being losers in "The Game"
[2:40:18] <AmericanaRed> NO WE DO THIS
[2:40:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Got em
[2:40:26] <+christmcmuffin> 5 minutes of gameplay, 2 hours of explaining lore
[2:40:28] <$RilsRislan> If everybody loses the game, then we all win.
[2:40:28] <AmericanaRed> INCEPTION
[2:40:31] <+phatmac16> Deeper than the nasuverse
[2:40:31] <AMajorTom> Back in Omikron, you reset the clock on Dharma and Greg references
[2:40:32] <GarettLefebvre> Guts mom is still pretty high strung
[2:40:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> All inside jokes are stupid beyond belief except to those inside. It's what makes them special to on the inside and horrible to those on the outside.
[2:40:51] <%UrsulaCat> what's dharma and greg
[2:40:52] <Vinny_Fives> It's so great to see years of lore murdered through glorious explanation XD
[2:40:54] <%Solidnick18> i see
[2:40:58] <@akuda_bar> it's what makes this game impenetrable to anyone but you guys
[2:40:58] <UrsaMinor222> woolie's going nutz
[2:40:59] <%Solidnick18> i got that
[2:41:02] <AmericanaRed> SBFP BEST THING HAPPENED
[2:41:04] <%GohanEgret> so comedy is a flow chart
[2:41:10] <+SuichiTanaka> This is literally SBFP.
[2:41:11] <Dhurkst> BECOME AS GRIFFITH
[2:41:12] <brambobelurkin> @MrGarettLefebvre under rated statement
[2:41:12] <$RilsRislan> This sorta lore
[2:41:13] <%UrsulaCat> @AmericanaRed it sure did
[2:41:17] <HitchhikingThrough> GOD THIS SOUNDS SO GOOD OUT OF CONTEXT
[2:41:18] <$RilsRislan> Is exactly what Asagao was lacking
[2:41:22] <KiraKamixephos> We are lore
[2:41:22] <%Menitta> Its why none of you got the Macho joke but everyone who knew hated it.
[2:41:22] <$RilsRislan> Normal Boots has fucking nothing
[2:41:22] <JobbedBone> ITS TOO REAL
[2:41:22] <+rdark_ksu> i love how woolie sounds like a crazy person
[2:41:25] <+Irridium> god I miss sbfp
[2:41:25] <%Doodle_Taco> Memes are made to be molded
[2:41:25] <AmericanaRed> RIP
[2:41:28] <+HeyBoston> if someone doesn't make a WOOLIE EXPLAINS IT ALL graphic like clarissa explains it all, I'm going to be upset.
[2:41:33] <$RilsRislan> So it's just a boring plain VN for NOBODY
[2:41:35] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> in jokes within in jokes
[2:41:37] <%UrsulaCat> I wish woolie and liam were making out
[2:41:41] <ManOfReason> Get out your tin foil hats

[2:42:00] <+HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[2:42:03] <%Solidnick18> oh boy
[2:42:04] <GarettLefebvre> I said Boourns
[2:42:04] <+jerree66> I love this
[2:42:05] <$RilsRislan> A lot of people say "Reset the Clock"
[2:42:05] <+rdark_ksu> THERE IS NO PEPE SILVIA
[2:42:05] <%Menitta> This really is too deep
[2:42:07] <Thirtine> part of why i love the zaibatzu LUL
[2:42:07] <+cvp5127> go deeper
[2:42:08] <vierleger> balls deep
[2:42:08] <%maskedriderhero> aaaaaaaa
[2:42:09] <%GohanEgret> and that's why Simpsons Wrestling memes are great
[2:42:10] <Vyneci> THIS NEEDS TO BE A FLOWCHART SOMEHOW
[2:42:12] <$RilsRislan> For many things
[2:42:16] <Novillion> SBFP humor is basically a 7-layer dip of references
[2:42:16] <%Doodle_Taco> YAMEROOO
[2:42:17] <@akuda_bar> LUL
[2:42:18] <%Solidnick18> it's a wall of lore
[2:42:18] <KiraKamixephos> I didn’t even know it was from pacific rim
[2:42:19] <DynamicMenace_> we're too deep to go back bois
[2:42:21] <Vinny_Fives> pull the ripcord, we're too deep!!
[2:42:23] <TheArrow_> the lore was the woolie hole all along
[2:42:26] <UrsaMinor222> reset the clock is a thing on peachsaliva's stream too
[2:42:27] <dukenux> WE DUG TOO DEEP
[2:42:27] <+PenmanLupine> it's a multimedia adventure!
[2:42:27] <+phatmac16> Just like fate lol
[2:42:29] <%Explodincatz> shes right
[2:42:30] <+shadowvrse> Power point this shit!
[2:42:31] <+Irridium> a self sustaining reference economy
[2:42:31] <AmericanaRed> WE ARE THE 90s FIGHTING GAME CLUB NOW
[2:42:32] <+goose_attack_almanac> Hey Woolie what time is it
[2:42:34] <$RilsRislan> He's overthinking it a bit
[2:42:39] <dukenux> It's a Turducken of a joke
[2:42:40] <$RilsRislan> But it's fiiiine
[2:42:41] <soutakuphi> Woolie pls keep playing
[2:42:49] <HitchhikingThrough> THIS IN ITSELF IS A LAYER
[2:42:50] <+StromkoPenguin> When the lore gets this layered it is not a good thing, pull up, pull up!
[2:42:51] <$RilsRislan> It can be overthought
[2:42:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> This lore is more out there than fucking Kingdom Hearts
[2:42:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> We're in a 300 episode anime trying to explain references to episode 73
[2:43:02] <+Bane_Kaikyo> The phrase "rset the clock" did not start at Pacific Rim...
[2:43:04] <HitchhikingThrough> WOOLIE LOSING IT TALKING ABOUT MEMES WILL IN TIME BECOME A MEME AS WELL
[2:43:05] <Orenjevel> truly we are the final layer of the abyss
[2:43:11] <+StromkoPenguin> Don't fall deeper into the Abyss of reference
[2:43:12] <Vinny_Fives> no no, comedy is always better once explained
[2:43:13] <UrsaMinor222> Yeah!
[2:43:21] <%GohanEgret> So BEst Friends lore is just MGS4
[2:43:21] <leargo> I'm having fun :)

[3:18:41] <+HostilePoundcakes> ah jeez
[3:18:43] <%alrobot2014> we can't find love on the ps4
[3:18:50] <+Axellogic> You are prolly better off just playing with randoms
[3:18:51] <+Irridium> if it works like how it does on pc they'd have to be on your friends list
[3:18:52] <arkv01> its time to gattai
[3:18:52] <%UrsulaCat> cute
[3:18:56] <supersanic94> i missed my agehaos
[3:18:57] <waifoong98> That's a nice Kirby
[3:18:57] <Nikbottom> PC or PS4?
[3:19:00] <ValidVenasaur> is it not on PC?
[3:19:00] <%fatal_penguin_> Guide my hips Woolie
[3:19:02] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> ps4
[3:19:04] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus You're ether random publc or PS4 friends list
[3:19:06] <JobbedBone> you are not along!
[3:19:08] <supersanic94> its on pc too
[3:19:12] <JobbedBone> you are not alone!
[3:19:13] <MTLxSpider> PRESS SPACE TO JUMP
[3:19:15] <Norasuko_Art> Oh wow
[3:19:17] <%alrobot2014> its on pc but there are accounts of hard drive corruption @ValidVenasaur
[3:19:22] <Norasuko_Art> I got in in time for Anthem?
[3:19:27] <supersanic94> prepare for EXTREME MOTION BLUR
[3:19:28] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> ITS BAD
[3:19:29] <DatAsuna> PLayed it on PC without issue
[3:19:31] <razielhex> The PC release had some wierd installation issues that might corrupt your drive and need to run CHKDSK
[3:19:31] <ValidVenasaur> oh ok
[3:19:33] <MonstarGrrrl> Y I K E S
[3:19:45] <Norasuko_Art> PC version is noming on your delicious HDD
[3:19:45] <%Menitta> Good luck with the UI. Its atrocious
[3:19:47] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> B I G Y I K E S
[3:19:51] <DomunDomunDomun> Do the enemies still say the N word?
[3:19:52] <+korth367> aaaaaa
[3:19:52] <+SuichiTanaka> No sense in risking it, even if there's almost no chance
[3:19:54] <+Irridium> B I G W O O F
[3:20:00] <razielhex> Anthem = Warframe
[3:20:00] <@Solidus_113> bring us closer Woolie
[3:20:09] <ToxInjection> Oh FUCK yeah Woolie. I'm literally playing it right now and just looked to Twitch for some background noise.
[3:20:10] <DatAsuna> Also it's a CPU monster
[3:20:11] <+SuichiTanaka> Anthem has almost NOTHING to do with Warframe
[3:20:14] <Norasuko_Art> Extensive Woofers
[3:20:16] <%ChoculaUltra> oof, literally had just finished installing it on Origins too. Thanks for the save, kinsmen.
[3:20:18] <+pale_salamander> Warframe>Anthem
[3:20:20] <+SuichiTanaka> it's WAY more like Firefall
[3:20:27] <%Doodle_Taco> I appreciate a good trashfire
[3:20:28] <@mothmandraws> no no opinions allowed
[3:20:30] <supersanic94> YOU PEOPLE PIQUED HIS CURIOUSITY
[3:20:31] <Nehson> people dont believe me when i say this but im actually woolie :)
[3:20:31] <%UrsulaCat> god cute
[3:20:31] <stabbityrabbit> @WoolieVersus Have you considered playing Darkstalkers on Getting Into Fighting Games? Specifically Vsav2/Darkstalkers 3. There really is no other game like it.
[3:20:33] <DatAsuna> So you probably wanna just play console anyway if you're on a not beefy pc atm
[3:20:35] <+Irridium> Sometimes it just takes up 100% of the CPU and sometimes it doesn't it's very odd
[3:20:38] <DatAsuna> NO
[3:20:40] <%OmegaWeltall> its fun, this buid is a buggy mess but its fun when it works
[3:20:41] <+HostilePoundcakes> Its ok not great just ok
[3:20:43] <ToxInjection> It's more fun than Destiny for me, that's for fucking sure
[3:20:43] <Nikbottom> I had a good fun playin it yesterday
[3:20:44] <%NKOrange> What forming an opinion ON THE INTERNET?
[3:20:47] <%fatal_penguin_> Anthem is the sequel to Warframe lol
[3:20:49] <DatAsuna> NO FIRST HAND OPINION ALLOWED
[3:20:52] <%Menitta> I bet you'll like the actual gameplay. That itself has some fun stuff
[3:20:54] <Lizard0TM> Anthem is better than Destiny 2
[3:20:54] <+Arkfyre> @SuichiTanaka Firefall? wow there's anme I haven't heard in a long time
[3:20:58] <+cvp5127> become a kamen rider
[3:20:59] <Lizard0TM> Fucked as it i
[3:21:02] <quietshun> "aggressively average"
[3:21:03] <Lizard0TM> is
[3:21:07] <ToxInjection> Being a cool Iron Man is cool
[3:21:10] <%Menitta> Aw darn
[3:21:12] <%commanderclaw> Nah, be like me and have my opinions
[3:21:18] <Laecerelius> I remember playing Firefall at some point. It was okay.
[3:21:22] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> Anthem is the sequel to Destiny 5
[3:21:22] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I'd rather have a Titanfall MMO
[3:21:23] <Norasuko_Art> Wow Woolie is gonna play Anthem sitting down? That's so disrespectful!
[3:21:26] <ToxInjection> and the different suits so are pretty sweet
[3:21:31] <+SuichiTanaka> It's good that Woolie is playing it though. Better to have an informed opinion for the podcast.
[3:21:32] <DatAsuna> or pure random
[3:21:35] <+gantz_zero> @woolieversus pick Interceptor when you hit level 12 TRUST ME
[3:21:43] <%Menitta> I mean you could just invite all of us Kappa
[3:21:43] <%GohanEgret> @Breakfast_Megapowers how about Titanfall Battle Royale Kappa
[3:21:50] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @GohanEgret Yes
[3:21:51] <ToxInjection> INTERCEPTOR BOIS VoHiYo
[3:21:52] <+Irridium> titanfall battle what now
[3:21:52] <DatAsuna> Yeah the death of lobbies and server browsers was sad

[3:22:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Don't read my donation Kappa
[3:22:33] <Nikbottom> Interceptor is a hoot and a half
[3:22:34] <%Menitta> Das a good theme
[3:22:37] <Flarepulse> Aenthem
[3:22:37] <sporktown_heroine> Literally just in time for me to want to watch Anthem gameplay
[3:22:40] <%fatal_penguin_> Was this game 3 e3‘s old?
[3:22:46] <+NiktenKing> WE IN?
[3:22:46] <masterfire23> what's the news about the titanfall br I didn't see it
[3:22:51] <Brainworm205> Oh god here we go. Trash fire inc
[3:22:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> How many games are even lucky enough to have a demo
[3:22:56] <ToxInjection> apatBig DEMOS
[3:22:59] <+NiktenKing> Oh just started... neat
[3:23:00] <Prevot> """Bioware"""
[3:23:02] <Norasuko_Art> Pour one down for BioWare
[3:23:02] <+Irridium> Anthem comes out a week after Metro and a week before Devil May Cry 5 which for me is... lol
[3:23:02] <%UrsulaCat> Ursula Cat logic: liking super two best friends is a valid replacement for a personality
[3:23:05] <prime_name> Just save them long enough to get DA4 out
[3:23:07] <+phatmac16> Oof
[3:23:10] <Flarepulse> Ant Hem
[3:23:12] <%GohanEgret> @masterfire23 apparently there might be a battle royale TF game coming really soon
[3:23:14] <Norasuko_Art> Bioware. The Anthem guys
[3:23:15] <+HostilePoundcakes> R I P Bioware
[3:23:16] <@mothmandraws> time for 3 hour loading screen
[3:23:16] <+gantz_zero> Do story to level 12 and pick only one javelin unlock @woolieversus
[3:23:17] <Lizard0TM> Anthem is not as bad as I thought it would be, and it's more fun than I expected. I'll probably end up getting it
[3:23:20] <+Tearonex> Can Woolie defeat the loading screen?
[3:23:22] <ToxInjection> Shit now I gotta stop playing the Anthem demo to watch Woolie play the demo
[3:23:22] <+pale_salamander> """""""""""""Bioware"""""""""""""
[3:23:22] <@mothmandraws> hery norasuko
[3:23:26] <%Menitta> Oh I wonder if the same menu bug will happ- no it didnt
[3:23:28] <Norasuko_Art> Hey Moth
[3:23:28] <%Menitta> nice
[3:23:35] <Norasuko_Art> I'm here to suffer
[3:23:53] <@mothmandraws> music is a little loud woolie
[3:23:53] <ToxInjection> Level 12 gets you the Javelin unlock yes
[3:23:54] <+NiktenKing> You can customize whenever
[3:23:54] <stabbityrabbit> What killed Anthem for me is that it runs terribly on my computer. Hopefully the console version is better.
[3:24:00] <@mothmandraws> only slightly
[3:24:02] <Laecerelius> Perfectly calibrated!
[3:24:04] <+pale_salamander> Oh hey Norasuko
[3:24:04] <+queaks> You can customise your boy from the start in terms of appearance
[3:24:05] <@akuda_bar> everybody suffer
[3:24:07] <ToxInjection> You can customize appearance whenever though
[3:24:09] <+NiktenKing> It has paint, wear and tear, and textures
[3:24:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Who here loves EA after the BIG SPORTS anime arc?
[3:24:13] <Lizard0TM> @WoolieVersus You can customize it immediately, but you need to get to level 12 to unlock another Warfr- I mean Javelin
[3:24:13] <+Blankets_and_Tea> @WoolieVersus once you get to level 12, you can pick one of three javelins: storm, interceptor, colossus. pick the one that seems cool to you naroEhehe
[3:24:13] <DatAsuna> Turn it up for yourself
[3:24:13] <+Arkfyre> Not perfectly calibrated
[3:24:15] <aRealBaboon> woolie is my waifu
[3:24:24] <%Rezca> do it for yourself, we will complain when you do horribly due to brightness
[3:24:24] <DatAsuna> Brightness will impact a puzzle int he first mission
[3:24:27] <Norasuko_Art> The PC version actually runs way better if you put vsync on and full screen.
[3:24:32] <Ninjagregory98> So Woolie is probably going to get really into warframe after this
[3:24:35] <Norasuko_Art> it's super choppyt with those off for some reason
[3:24:37] <%UrsulaCat> PARFACT
[3:24:38] <ToxInjection> Do what's good for your eyeballs
[3:24:38] <+gantz_zero> Sorry I just mean you only get to unlock one additional Javelin. For you, you need Interceptor @woolieversus
[3:24:40] <+Irridium> @stabbityrabbit xbonex and ps4 pro run fine but the base consoles, or xbone at least, runs like ass. solid 20fps
[3:24:44] <@mothmandraws> I like the music though
[3:24:50] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Can we go back in time to the EA Sports timeline?
[3:24:52] <+Axellogic> Do be sure to equip your skills before you get out for some reason a bunch of skills wont be equipped on your javelin until you put them on
[3:24:55] <+paladinstarbuster> he tryed to weeb
[3:24:55] <@mothmandraws> mainyl cause I like heavy synth sounding voices
[3:24:55] <masterfire23> vsync DansGame
[3:24:58] <%Doodle_Taco> He tried
[3:24:58] <+NiktenKing> I fucking love that multilayer vocoder thing they used during the orchestra
[3:25:02] <$KnivesEve> can you be a punch robot in this game?
[3:25:03] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus a puzzle in first mission involves seeing something in a dark area, so goo brightness matters
[3:25:11] <%maskedriderhero> That sounds like they are ripping off Daft Punk
[3:25:14] <ToxInjection> I need someone to tell ME to get into the goddamn robot
[3:25:19] <razielhex> it's so good when developers put in colorblind modes
[3:25:23] <sileo_patronus> BIG
[3:25:24] <@mothmandraws> tbf masked daft punk didnt invent that sound
[3:25:26] <Norasuko_Art> l a r g e
[3:25:27] <stabbityrabbit> @Irridium Oof, that's almost as bad as the rubberbanding I got. Shame, the game itself is alright.
[3:25:30] <razielhex> you guys have no idea how much that helps people like me
[3:25:31] <%GohanEgret> @ToxInjection get into the goddamn robot!
[3:25:34] <Ninjagregory98> It feels weird watching woolie play a western main stream game
[3:25:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> OC is RAGE
[3:25:43] <+NiktenKing> Female voice sounds more sassy and charming
[3:25:47] <Lizard0TM> doesn't matter
[3:25:50] <NeedlesD> Female voice
[3:25:50] <Norasuko_Art> select robot voice
[3:25:50] <$DoktahDoktah> ANFEM
[3:25:52] <MasshuShirouchi> theres no character creator
[3:25:55] <+NiktenKing> You don't get an OC iirc
[3:25:55] <%UrsulaCat> do a male oc
[3:25:55] <@mothmandraws> can I build a woolie or a waifu
[3:25:55] <+paladinstarbuster> girl
[3:25:56] <MasshuShirouchi> its just armors
[3:25:56] <DatAsuna> Nope
[3:25:57] <@akuda_bar> no character creator
[3:25:57] <zamzoph> you're fucking iron man
[3:25:58] <%alrobot2014> is female voice jen hale?
[3:25:58] <+Irridium> doesn't matter you never see your character
[3:25:59] <waifoong98> Choose Kirby LUL
[3:26:00] <$DoktahDoktah> Female!
[3:26:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Imma go in and say no
[3:26:00] <Brainworm205> Oh FUCK Woolie it’s a demo, pick one
[3:26:00] <Norasuko_Art> If you go male they give you some asian dude
[3:26:02] <@mothmandraws> woolie or waifu
[3:26:03] <DatAsuna> You are floating camera
[3:26:06] <Lizard0TM> The charater is the Javeling
[3:26:07] <+NiktenKing> OR at least not in the demo
[3:26:08] <%OmegaWeltall> you barely see you characrter... like once.. .maybe
[3:26:09] <ToxInjection> You can get closer than you expect LUL
[3:26:10] <+gantz_zero> No custom character in demo @woolieversus
[3:26:10] <%GarbageNirvana> From what I've heard you're just cycling through faces
[3:26:10] <Fabric_tester> You dont get either
[3:26:11] <Sol_996> which javelin are you most interested in?
[3:26:12] <%linkwolf4> oh shit super fighting robots woolieCHAN
[3:26:13] <Lizard0TM> voice doesn't matter
[3:26:22] <+Axellogic> Dont worry both characters have dead eyes
[3:26:28] <mechagrover> LETS GO FEMOOLIE
[3:26:29] <+PenmanLupine> @WoolieVersus you get to choose your custom javelin later in the demo
[3:26:33] <+Axellogic> oh you can freely customize your suit
[3:26:35] <ManOfReason> Woolie you already known they are not going to let you make yourself lol
[3:26:35] <Norasuko_Art> you can customize your robot waifu
[3:26:36] <ToxInjection> You can tell yourself one of the helmets can have dreads. Really short dreads.
[3:26:38] <%commanderclaw> If you can't build Woolie, you build Casca
[3:26:40] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you customize the suit, the pilot is nobody
[3:26:44] <+NiktenKing> You can custom javelin
[3:26:46] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus it's mostly suit colour and texture
[3:26:47] <+NiktenKing> not character
[3:26:48] <+gantz_zero> Full javelin customization for sure though @woolieversus
[3:26:50] <@mothmandraws> you custom your javelin later
[3:26:53] <%fatal_penguin_> This game is basically Steel Battalion
[3:26:56] <%UrsulaCat> whatnot
[3:26:57] <@mothmandraws> you dont see your actual character
[3:26:57] <Lizard0TM> You can customize your Javelin
[3:26:59] <dekkitout> paint your suit
[3:27:00] <+HostilePoundcakes> Only the suit
[3:27:06] <ToxInjection> Your JAVELIN, not your PERSON.
[3:27:10] <+PenmanLupine> @WoolieVersus you can customize the suit later in the demo
[3:27:14] <Norasuko_Art> you see the pilot's face for 1 second
[3:27:15] <ToxInjection> You're still a human, unfortunately
[3:27:15] <dekkitout> ie, doll dressup
[3:27:24] <waifoong98> load time DansGame
[3:27:25] <%Menitta> Thats the same thing

[3:27:37] <GamerGoat007> youll see
[3:27:39] <InsomniacPersona> !uptime
[3:27:43] <+DeadManFlopping> The customization in this game is the best I've seen.
[3:27:43] <Ninjagregory98> Are we going to pretend there’s a difference?
[3:27:44] <PlainSimpleTailor> Is this Anthem? Now, wait a minute WOOLIE NOOOOOO
[3:27:49] <Norasuko_Art> you never see the pilot to be fair, you see their face when the robot closes the visor for 1 second and that's it
[3:27:50] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> i wanna ba an Aluminum Man
[3:27:51] <+NiktenKing> LANCER and JAVELIN

[3:28:36] <+HostilePoundcakes> LET US FREE
[3:28:38] <stabbityrabbit> Ooof, I thought that would be a PC issue.
[3:28:38] <zamzoph> COOL GAME PogChamp
[3:28:39] <WSintai> @mothmandraws Bioware needs our help; give us your moms credit card to save them
[3:28:39] <Hyphixsys> why are they using a web browser? LUL
[3:28:39] <@mothmandraws> there are no controls woolie, we dont like limits
[3:28:39] <+zinris> hold on
[3:28:39] <ToxInjection> It works if you check on mobile/desktop

[3:29:14] <$Superdandy96> Live services everyone LOL
[3:29:16] <Laironx3> Bioware - Be aware
[3:29:20] <@mothmandraws> I want all the game to be in websites
[3:29:24] <AMajorTom> They just sent you a build and want your compliance feedback
[3:29:25] <+Irridium> the hub area is first person the overworld is third person. basically reverse destiny
[3:29:26] <@mothmandraws> anytime you talk to npc
[3:29:26] <+NiktenKing> You can totally flirt
[3:29:29] <@mothmandraws> it opens web browser
[3:29:31] <%Menitta> Lmao I made same mistake
[3:29:32] <UnfilteredComic> Just the city is first person

[3:29:49] <%UrsulaCat> welcome to my personal space
[3:29:49] <GamerGoat007> Hes going to like it guys
[3:29:57] <prime_name> Something about this is uncanny man.
[3:30:01] <Hyphixsys> the fact that they use web browser on a triple A game, is just simply bad design
[3:30:03] <@mothmandraws> "content is not available in this demo" is my chat up line
[3:30:05] <Norasuko_Art> it's not the COdex it's the CORTEX!
[3:30:06] <Lizard0TM> @WoolieVersus You're only in first person in this area
[3:30:17] <waifoong98> man that's some pretentious arse menu art
[3:30:21] <%Doodle_Taco> This is it for me, see you later guys
[3:30:24] <PlainSimpleTailor> Bioware is collateral damage at this point, we knew their fate was sealed with the acquisition
[3:30:24] <fazril6333> dey gon dunk on this so hard
[3:30:25] <InsomniacPersona> You cant talk to anyone unless they have a symbol above them
[3:30:31] <%GohanEgret> with the smallest text imaginable
[3:30:33] <sileo_patronus> @mothmandraws do you also wear a chastity cage with the key as DLC?
[3:30:34] <@mothmandraws> how to play is in hints and riddles
[3:30:39] <Hyphixsys> LUL this menu
[3:30:41] <zamzoph> ResidentSleeper
[3:30:43] <UnfilteredComic> just do it, learn by doin
[3:30:46] <%alrobot2014> i need my glasses to read the fucking menu

[3:30:52] <%blaccbird914> whoah hold on! why is the menu covering the text!
[3:30:54] <Fabric_tester> fuck it lets read it all
[3:31:03] <%UrsulaCat> do by learning
[3:31:03] <@mothmandraws> all this wasted space in menu UI
[3:31:03] <%GarbageNirvana> @mothmandraws I don't think they're copying Warframe that much
[3:31:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is life just a game you are playing in 1st Person?
[3:31:07] <Hyphixsys> this game is very telling LUL
[3:31:13] <Lizard0TM> @WoolieVersus This all gets explained in the mission you do Woolie
[3:31:13] <CrimsonGargoyle> JESUS WHAT IS THIS UI LUL
[3:31:13] <kungfooTitan> !uptime
[3:31:18] <+Irridium> I do hope there's a tutorial mission in the final game or something because otherwise, woof
[3:31:19] <ModeratelyHardcore> It's standard FPS controls. To fly jump with X then click in left stick
[3:31:19] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> DONT COVER YOUR UI TEXT
[3:31:19] <PlainSimpleTailor> It's DestinyFrame
[3:31:22] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> LIKE FUCK
[3:31:23] <+HostilePoundcakes> Get in the robot Woolie
[3:31:24] <Press_Any> Anthem is out already, really?
[3:31:25] <@mothmandraws> that entire bottom left screen unused
[3:31:25] <ToxInjection> holy SHIT Interceptor is fun to control. What a nice Iron Man simulator.
[3:31:27] <Norasuko_Art> the only thing that took me time to figure out was that the weapon switch button was holding reload.
[3:31:29] <waifoong98> "DIAGONAL" is "VERY ORIGINAL" donut steal LUL
[3:31:29] <3Xgilly> oh noi
[3:31:32] <%alrobot2014> and i thought smite's ui was bad
[3:31:33] <Press_Any> I don't think I've heard anyone talk about it
[3:31:33] <sileo_patronus> Why have BOTH a journal AND Library?
[3:31:34] <+gantz_zero> Just ask chat “how do I hover” and stuff @woolieversus
[3:31:35] <Fabric_tester> LUL
[3:31:36] <%GarbageNirvana> @Press_Any Demo this weekend, game's proper out on the 22nd
[3:31:43] <@mothmandraws> who is talking
[3:31:43] <+NiktenKing> I think it's TOUCHPAD and then options
[3:31:44] <Lizard0TM> @WoolieVersus press touch pad to get to settings
[3:31:46] <CrimsonGargoyle> v-sync, we here at EA don't need dat nerd shit
[3:31:55] <+cvp5127> is there a carth yet?
[3:31:57] <InsomniacPersona> Is there no music?
[3:32:01] <Hyphixsys> OH MAH GAD, the animation is worse if not, has the same quality as Andromeda LUL
[3:32:01] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Wait, was that a Male voice from the Freelancer at the start?
[3:32:03] <%GarbageNirvana> I guess that's your voice
[3:32:03] <prime_name> What is this accent? Irish?
[3:32:04] <@mothmandraws> is it desynced?
[3:32:06] <+NiktenKing> There is music in the bazaar
[3:32:08] <+PenmanLupine> its desynced
[3:32:09] <Lizard0TM> Everyone sounds like they recorded in a velley
[3:32:12] <sileo_patronus> Welsh? Maybe?
[3:32:13] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @Hyphixsys It's desynched
[3:32:14] <+NiktenKing> not in the citadel area
[3:32:19] <Norasuko_Art> he's future british
[3:32:21] <Dutchpotato> I love that I’ve been watching stream for like 2 minutes and I already hate this game
[3:32:22] <Lizard0TM> valley
[3:32:22] <InsomniacPersona> Oh it is desynced
[3:32:23] <%alrobot2014> it looks desynced
[3:32:23] <Ninjagregory98> Is the echo intentional?
[3:32:24] <%maskedriderhero> echo-echo-cho-ho-o
[3:32:28] <Hyphixsys> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS OOMF
[3:32:32] <@mothmandraws> its liked a dubbed movie
[3:32:32] <ToxInjection> Yeaaah, acting is... tolerable.
[3:32:36] <waifoong98> what s this lip sync....
[3:32:36] <GamerGoat007> play the tank first
[3:32:44] <Ninjagregory98> Holy shit this game looks bad
[3:32:52] <%Life_of_Mamba> so is this destiny of warframe
[3:32:55] <%maskedriderhero> Whys he moving so much
[3:32:56] <Norasuko_Art> Guy in the bg is trying to get your attention
[3:32:56] <+mechslayer71> The story shit is not good, I’ve played a lot of the demo LUL
[3:32:57] <@mothmandraws> not you woolie its in game
[3:32:58] <Hyphixsys> @Ninjagregory98 it reminds me of RAGE
[3:32:59] <sileo_patronus> Yeah this guy sounds either fake welsh or real welsh but unskilled actor
[3:33:03] <ToxInjection> It plays better than literally everything else.
[3:33:04] <%GarbageNirvana> What is it with dialogue animation being so exaggerated
[3:33:04] <+walnutcast> show FEET
[3:33:06] <%fatal_penguin_> Is this Fallout 76
[3:33:07] <CrimsonGargoyle> "We need freelancers to bring in contracts" - We need players to bring in investors. holy shit too real LUL
[3:33:13] <xBolts4Lifex> OMG love that kirby light
[3:33:14] <DSD24> Hi Woolie Hi everyone!
[3:33:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> E-A SPORTS, ITS IN THE GAME!
[3:33:21] <dekkitout> i now understand why its best to have story and lore given to me by an englishman on youtube
[3:33:23] <waifoong98> did they learn ANYTHING from ANDROMEDA!?
[3:33:24] <+gantz_zero> I think the game audio sync is off but not you @woolieversus
[3:33:26] <Zayasu> it might be the game
[3:33:33] <CrimsonGargoyle> @waifoong98 lmao no LUL
[3:33:40] <ToxInjection> And I mean better than anything else. Like fuck this game EXCEPT for being Iron Man.
[3:33:40] <+SuichiTanaka> I dunno why people say this is like Warframe. This is darn near as far away from it as you can get.
[3:33:41] <Hyphixsys> @Breakfast_Megapowers would not be surprised if EA decided to make an Esports form this LUL
[3:33:43] <waifoong98> @CrimsonGargoyle LUL
[3:33:44] <@mothmandraws> no talking
[3:33:44] <+Ecchigun> thats anthem ?
[3:33:44] <Triplicat> I looked back and got sick immediately
[3:33:48] <Triplicat> blurgh
[3:33:49] <Ninjagregory98> @hyphixsys At least Rage was an FPS made by Id
[3:33:50] <%fatal_penguin_> Anthem 76
[3:33:53] <+Ecchigun> how is the game so far
[3:34:00] <prime_name> That's....dialogue.
[3:34:01] <+Irridium> there's like 3 people you can talk to in the demo. that guy was one, there's one in a bar and one next to your javalin
[3:34:02] <Triplicat> motion blur.mp4
[3:34:06] <%GohanEgret> ZOOM
[3:34:06] <%Chichen> good now
[3:34:08] <+queaks> Cant talk to many people
[3:34:09] <+zestyArsenic> lots of gameplay for a demo
[3:34:11] <Norasuko_Art> Welcome to my personal space
[3:34:11] <Hyphixsys> @Ninjagregory98 I've yet to beat that game LUL
[3:34:11] <UnfilteredComic> talkable npc are marked on map
[3:34:11] <+gantz_zero> @hyphixsys it can’t be, there’s no pvp in the full game at all
[3:34:13] <$Avolver001> had a good time with Anthem, a lot better than my initial impression
[3:34:14] <+mechslayer71> Interested to see how woolie feels about the flying, I think it’s fine personally but apparently it’s made better in a new build. God knows the menus need the help
[3:34:14] <Lizard0TM> it's fine
[3:34:19] <ToxInjection> Yeah, a majority of NPCs are locked for the demo
[3:34:22] <+queaks> its fine
[3:34:25] <+HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[3:34:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Black lady not available in demo
[3:34:27] <Hyphixsys> @gantz_zero yeah, but we'll see though LUL
[3:34:29] <%Twoiis> 'run'
[3:34:30] <waifoong98> LUL "Content not available" LUL "BUY THE GAME" LUL
[3:34:31] <Laecerelius> Get in the robot, Woolie!
[3:34:33] <Ropcord> GET IN THE FUCKING ROBOT WOOLIE
[3:34:35] <sileo_patronus> Ghost doors
[3:34:36] <Ropcord> dangit
[3:34:43] <+NiktenKing> You have walk and slightly faster walk
[3:34:44] <%fatal_penguin_> Get in your Halo man armor
[3:34:48] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Hub is super empty
[3:34:49] <Hyphixsys> man, this demo is behind paywall LUL
[3:34:51] <Norasuko_Art> You don't want to talk to any NPCs woolie, what do you think this is? a BIOWARE game?
[3:34:52] <GamerGoat007> she pretty
[3:34:53] <@mothmandraws> map reminds me of guild wars 1
[3:34:54] <$KnivesEve> BUY GAME CONSUMER
[3:34:55] <sileo_patronus> Oh god it's a 3d model map
[3:34:55] <@mothmandraws> I miss that game
[3:34:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> remember how good the Nier Demo was?
[3:35:02] <+queaks> map is pretty
[3:35:14] <UnfilteredComic> definitely jump into freeplay before the missions @WoolieVersus
[3:35:17] <+PhantomMiG> @woolieversus Do you think that this is triple A game in February is a bad sign for this game on EAs part
[3:35:24] <Norasuko_Art> Why would a Bioware game have any interesting npcs?
[3:35:30] <+mechslayer71> Do freeplay first @woolieversus just to get a feel for it
[3:35:33] <Hyphixsys> @Breakfast_Megapowers because that was made by a competent developer
[3:35:33] <waifoong98> @Norasuko_Art LUL
[3:35:35] <ToxInjection> Map is pretty but it's not the greatest for actual pathfinding. Feels busy at times to me.
[3:35:37] <sileo_patronus> Though at least it looks like this map zooms in more than some other 3d ones
[3:35:39] <+gantz_zero> @unfilteredcomic he needs to do story to unlock the best suit though
[3:35:39] <%fatal_penguin_> Wheres the Pay Respect button
[3:35:42] <%alrobot2014> you'd think that the demo would be representative of actual gameplay considering it come out in 3 weeks
[3:36:01] <prime_name> Where did the wind go?
[3:36:08] <masterfire23> this game has too many loading screens for an "open world" game
[3:36:10] <ToxInjection> I'll be surprised if the game actually runs well on release. It feels rough.
[3:36:15] <CrimsonGargoyle> @prime_name DLC LUL Kappa
[3:36:17] <+ragathorne> How is the game so far?
[3:36:22] <InsomniacPersona> EA needs something out this quarter
[3:36:23] <ToxInjection> Still lots of frame drops and shit
[3:36:29] <%GohanEgret> @Reevesypoo he just started
[3:36:32] <+gantz_zero> Don’t try to solo, 100% built for at least random matchmaking @woolieversus
[3:36:34] <$Superdandy96> I got a bad feeling this game is gonna kill BioWare
[3:36:42] <Hyphixsys> @InsomniacPersona no idea why the rush, I find it awful, IMO
[3:36:43] <Norasuko_Art> I feel the framerate is choppy on the console too, but it might be twitch
[3:36:44] <%Twoiis> @VyperVic Yo thanks for the gift sub. Sorry I only just noticed.
[3:36:49] <%Life_of_Mamba> michael keegan?
[3:36:55] <ToxInjection> I tried doing an expedition alone once. Got fucking bodied.
[3:36:56] <@mothmandraws> sync is better now
[3:36:57] <InsomniacPersona> same @Hyphixsys
[3:37:03] <waifoong98> hipster tribal futuristic tattoo LUL
[3:37:09] <+gantz_zero> Sync looks great
[3:37:09] <DatAsuna> has digital foundry done a demo analysis yet?
[3:37:10] <+mechslayer71> The game isn’t balanced for single player, woolie. Don’t try to do missions by yourself, you’ll get overwhelmed @woolieversus
[3:37:10] <+thechungiestofbois> @Norasuko_Art was playing on PS4 just now. It is definately choppy on console
[3:37:11] <kungfooTitan> Is it also why there's rumors of that Titanfall BR rumoured for this coming week?
[3:37:11] <arkv01> the line delivery makes me want to stomp stomething
[3:37:13] <dekkitout> that was like what, 5 different pronouns he mentioned
[3:37:13] <+ragathorne> @GohanEgret Ah okay, good, I just got home and saw he was streaming.
[3:37:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> In BASTION?!?! Quick, change the game! @WoolieVersus
[3:37:16] <prime_name> Why does he have the Alliance Navy Logo on his cheeks?
[3:37:19] <Hyphixsys> @InsomniacPersona rush, and not to mention, bad decisions making with the game
[3:37:22] <+paladinstarbuster> THE HEART OF RAGE
[3:37:24] <Norasuko_Art> On PC it was choppy like that on borderless
[3:37:32] <%IMDRanged> This game is 0% anime
[3:37:35] <sileo_patronus> The lipsync isn't great
[3:37:37] <%CptnCampy61> Not sure I like the nameless hero having voice/dialogue
[3:37:37] <Norasuko_Art> but it got better on dedicated full screen
[3:37:38] <%GohanEgret> @Reevesypoo yeah, he first went through ahegao academy again to get the woolie ending
[3:37:38] <Hyphixsys> @IMDRanged LUL
[3:37:40] <ToxInjection> @norasuko_art honestly, it's the demo. Shit gets real choppy when a ton of effects are on screen, like particle explosions and lasers.
[3:37:48] <@mothmandraws> man one thing though about this game, its aesthetic feels somewhat like every concept artists portolfio designs
[3:37:50] <Ropcord> so is this like avatar+iron man or what
[3:37:51] <+NiktenKing> That's... not true. I played it all single player
[3:37:52] <+PhantomMiG> So is this an future time or an alternate reality?
[3:37:52] <+gantz_zero> Default is random matchmaking @woolieversus
[3:37:54] <masterfire23> motion blur WutFace
[3:37:58] <+Irridium> I don't even think the game lets you try a mission by yourself. When I tried to set my stuff to private it said I wasn't allowed in the demo
[3:37:58] <UnfilteredComic> Go to forge
[3:38:04] <+queaks> Just matchmake with randos its fine
[3:38:23] <ToxInjection> and it feels choppy OUT of the suit. Like how is your main hub area dropping frames?
[3:38:31] <@Solidus_113> woolieOMG
[3:38:31] <+ihavethereads> Just go to the suit
[3:38:32] <+HostilePoundcakes> DOLL UP YOUR IRON MAN
[3:38:34] <+Omnisaurus > is woolie really going to take on the best?
[3:38:35] <+mechslayer71> @niktenking There’s one spot in particular that I did by myself that fucking sucked. I got through, but it sucked.
[3:38:38] <@mothmandraws> is there no "click on map to enter mode"
[3:38:39] <+gantz_zero> You need to walk to your suit to launch missions @woolieversus
[3:38:42] <+NiktenKing> You can't do solo freeplay, you can solo missions though
[3:38:45] <@mothmandraws> or doy oyu need to walk there
[3:38:51] <+rdark_ksu> oh shit i thought ya'll had stopped with the VN end. Rad
[3:38:52] <+Omnisaurus > dat butt
[3:39:00] <UnfilteredComic> Forge first tho
[3:39:02] <+mechslayer71> Sentinels are big bois
[3:39:02] <@Solidus_113> you have to walk and watch the expensive cutscene
[3:39:03] <prime_name> Are we in Death Mountain?
[3:39:05] <Bennett_Fracture> futuristique monster hunter...
[3:39:09] <waifoong98> almost 10 minutes and still no mech? Time to stream Armored Core / Ace Combat Woolie Kappa
[3:39:10] <+NiktenKing> FORGE FIRST
[3:39:12] <+HostilePoundcakes> FORGE
[3:39:13] <%IMDRanged> You enter your suit from the front or the back of it?
[3:39:14] <+queaks> dont mess with police lord
[3:39:17] <+Axellogic> you can selet
[3:39:19] <dekkitout> pimp yo riiide
[3:39:20] <Norasuko_Art> I'm gonna be 1000% real. I think the only thing this game has going on is the cool robot legs
[3:39:23] <GamerGoat007> tank
[3:39:23] <DatAsuna> You can forge from the suit
[3:39:25] <Hyphixsys> LOCKTED
[3:39:28] <Norasuko_Art> not even the whole robot, just the legs
[3:39:29] <arkv01> this WRITING
[3:39:30] <+mechslayer71> Customize your mech woolie!
[3:39:30] <prime_name> She's outside! Why is there echo?!
[3:39:33] <arkv01> KILL
[3:39:34] <+Axellogic> But go into the fforge next her to equip your starter equipment
[3:39:37] <+pale_salamander> is the audio tinny or is it just me?

[3:39:45] <+Cityscape17> ok woolie, please tell me the game is working well and fun to play

[3:39:48] <%UrsulaCat> she's cute
[3:39:52] <waifoong98> ((((ECHO)))) LUL
[3:39:52] <Hyphixsys> @prime_name EA wants immersion, that's why they wanted echo
[3:39:53] <+mechslayer71> Entering the javelin just gives you the options for freeplay/mission stuff
[3:39:53] <count_bob> Are you guys just....looking to shit on this game?
[3:39:55] <DatAsuna> The game needs more lost planet akrid
[3:39:56] <xBolts4Lifex> @Ninjagregory98 my face is tired
[3:39:56] <+Jeebus4> It feels really good to fly in the game. Writing is touch and go.
[3:39:56] <ToxInjection> Zoe Kreygasm
[3:39:57] <%maskedriderhero> Her neck looks really long
[3:39:58] <Norasuko_Art> She3's got a bit of Andromeda going on in her face
[3:40:03] <arkv01> this NPC has PS2 texture face
[3:40:09] <kungfooTitan> I'm seeing animation flashbacks to andromeda again WutFace
[3:40:09] <%GohanEgret> @Cityscape17 he hasn't started a mission yet
[3:40:12] <Prevot> N E C C
[3:40:14] <+TheApostles101> Anthem is the most disappointing thing since my son
[3:40:18] <ToxInjection> So she flirts with you no matter what. Cool.
[3:40:19] <+paladinstarbuster> accents hot though
[3:40:21] <masterfire23> NECK THICC
[3:40:22] <Hyphixsys> LUL

[3:40:41] <Lizard0TM> FORGE
[3:40:41] <+Irridium> forge is the console next to her
[3:40:44] <Norasuko_Art> a strong neck is desirable in a mate
[3:40:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Big Necks for Big Suck
[3:40:52] <+ragathorne> This hub seems kind of desolate
[3:40:52] <Hyphixsys> LA FORGE, HERE
[3:40:53] <DatAsuna> I ruined ME1 for myself when I noticed femshep's neck
[3:40:59] <+Axellogic> weird
[3:41:05] <Laecerelius> Gotta have someone with a strong neck, unlike that weak necked Jason
[3:41:06] <+Irridium> you gotta move back to access it it's odd
[3:41:06] <+HostilePoundcakes> Wut

[3:41:35] <ToxInjection> Or that works too
[3:41:36] <%IMDRanged> Real Chicken legs would cost extra
[3:41:36] <$Avolver001> change colors its cool
[3:41:36] <Norasuko_Art> There's the point of the game
[3:41:43] <+queaks> I personally like the chicken legs
[3:41:44] <Reanimator83> I hate the design of this town/city

[3:49:01] <+paladinstarbuster> EVA 01 is lime green
[3:49:01] <+Arkfyre> Fashemth
[3:49:03] <Parapattern> Everyone throw tomatoes at this fuckin weeb
[3:49:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Minty!!!
[3:49:04] <+HostilePoundcakes> This is the best part of the demo
[3:49:05] <Zayasu> BILLY PogChamp
[3:49:10] <+VoytekBus> the hypest color circling on twitch
[3:49:11] <Kaneis> I'm excited I love Billy/Woolie combo

[3:49:54] <+christmcmuffin> thanks doc
[3:49:58] <+Spec7re> I really want to see some colossus gameplay
[3:49:59] <DSD24> That's why Armored Core had the best color options
[3:50:03] <Parapattern> I'm sure you could look it up
[3:50:08] <Chocolate_Burrito> CLOSE
[3:50:08] <%UrsulaCat> it's not intuitive
[3:50:12] <waifoong98> Man this is annoying, you are telling me ACV, an older game makes it EASIER TO PICK COLOR than this NEW GAME
[3:50:22] <+VoytekBus> Pantone 734C
[3:50:26] <Norasuko_Art> The best would be to use plastic to have the pure color then change it to metal
[3:50:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hypest gameplay on twitch
[3:50:27] <InsomniacPersona> damn
[3:50:37] <+paladinstarbuster> ew
[3:50:40] <sileo_patronus> Game devs please let use input numerical colours
[3:50:44] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:50:45] <+mechslayer71> Woolie has a Pro, right?
[3:50:47] <DSD24> @waifoong98 Armored Core already did this great

[3:51:42] <s0nata_ii> LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH
[3:51:43] <%IMDRanged> CoolStoryBob "Let's add a little vandyke brown."

[3:52:10] <+law240> Game reminds me of Earth Defense Force
[3:52:15] <+Spec7re> Eva Unit-01
[3:52:16] <waifoong98> Also Armored Core 5 does stickers better than any other game, even Soul Caliburr aint got shit on it @DSD24
[3:52:24] <+NiktenKing> remember changing the material of the part can also change the color selection
[3:52:26] <Kaneis> @SoushinSen You gonna hop on VC with Woolie?
[3:52:29] <vierleger> If we got Plague in here would this be an episode of The Drawing BORED?
[3:52:35] <InsomniacPersona> The purple should be closer to (118,88,152) @WoolieVersus its way too bright
[3:52:37] <sileo_patronus> @SoushinSen I think you'll be waiting a few hours
[3:52:40] <DSD24> @waifoong98 My brother always made battle damaged versions of his ACS

[3:52:59] <%IMDRanged> "Get in the robot, Woolie"
[3:53:05] <DSD24> Is that Purple more of a Lilac?
[3:53:07] <kungfooTitan> seems very desaturated on my end
[3:53:07] <@mothmandraws> woolie check link I posted
[3:53:08] <ToxInjection> That's a pale-ass purple

[3:57:21] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus changing the material ID to leather or something might help it look less loud
[3:57:21] <FackinCrazy> Looks like its wearing a school swimsuit
[3:57:22] <+NiktenKing> Adding chromate finish limits your color selection to actual metal colors though
[3:57:22] <%IMDRanged> CoolStoryBob
[3:57:27] <+gantz_zero> star platinum = black and white Kappa
[3:57:28] <kungfooTitan> This is true
[3:57:29] <+Irridium> jojo colors change each scene sometimes
[3:57:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, so it'll be correct no matter what you do
[3:57:31] <InsomniacPersona> Platinum is Green
[3:57:31] <stabbityrabbit> ALL OF THEM

[3:57:37] <+Keyd00d> black and white Kappa
[3:57:38] <+MiraLangsuir> Star Platinum is actually purple!
[3:57:38] <+machinetoys> green
[3:57:41] <UnfilteredComic> Melee is hardly a thing in this game anyway @WoolieVersus
[3:57:41] <dekkitout> paint it green and chroma key in an image of unit 1 Kappa
[3:57:42] <%Menitta> I wanna see you try an RX 78 @WoolieVersus
[3:57:42] <+mighty_max_t> Blue Green for Jolyne or go home

[3:57:52] <+MiraLangsuir> BLUE
[3:57:54] <Bennett_Fracture> as he say while sipping on his expensive drink...

[3:57:55] <Oncila> Is a Zaku possible?
[3:57:56] <randomness_yo> get to the shot bang Woolie. I want to see the Anthem
[3:57:58] <Norasuko_Art> What color does king crimson works?
[3:57:59] <jumbomanlive> I wish someone loved me like @WoolieVersus likes Eva Unit 01
[3:58:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> The colors of a Jojo anything are dependent on the person viewing it as much as Araki's Colouring
[3:58:19] <zamzoph> SIEG ZEON
[3:58:22] <%maskedriderhero> Woolie
[3:58:24] <%maskedriderhero> Its a demo

[3:58:28] <DSD24> Char's Zaku 2 is the best Zaku
[3:58:29] <NerdSquid> Mono eyes are awesome.

[3:58:44] <FackinCrazy> Zakus are so cool
[3:58:44] <%Rezca> could also go as a ScopeDog
[3:58:44] <Bennett_Fracture> is the game worth the prize tag woolie...

[3:59:02] <Cure_Optimism> Buying this game on launch would be a horrible decision

[3:59:22] <sileo_patronus> @maskedriderhero and he's demonstrating the customisation system
[3:59:22] <DSD24> I miss painting Armored Cores
[3:59:25] <+Spec7re> This reminds me of the hours i spent on the Spore creation demo its a shame that game sucked
[3:59:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Take Gorillaz advice and Do Ya Thang
[3:59:33] <Bennett_Fracture> thanks for the cure... optimism...
[3:59:35] <DatAsuna> You should keep the shaders for same colours consistent as well
[3:59:36] <%maskedriderhero> o...okay...
[3:59:41] <SilverSnake55> Yo Whats the name of this Jaeger??????
[3:59:42] <DSD24> @Spec7re Oh wow I did too! I made cute bugs
[3:59:43] <+dumemoto> YIKES
[3:59:44] <DatAsuna> You don't want shiny highlights for a uniform area
[3:59:46] <+Anonymasque> Yeah I'm also enjoying this customization sensation!
[3:59:48] <ValidVenasaur> the yellow should be orange
[3:59:48] <@mothmandraws> change the metalic bars to green aswell
[3:59:50] <+gantz_zero> i spent my entire first and last hour in this menu @WoolieVersus
[3:59:53] <+paladinstarbuster> some blue
[3:59:58] <waifoong98> @DSD24 we need more game with that god tier stickers
[4:00:01] <Lizard0TM> I think it's funny that EA's logo doesn't appear at all when starting up Anthem
[4:00:04] <Parapattern> He looks like a Mardi Gras G-Gundam from Neo Nawlins
[4:00:04] <$RilsRislan> Why are all the menus at a slant that creates a ton of negative space on the left
[4:00:05] <+Spec7re> @DSD24 Wow thats way more innocent then what i made
[4:00:05] <Norasuko_Art> you can chancge the metal
[4:00:07] <Chocolate_Burrito> rip
[4:00:07] <+paladinstarbuster> blueish
[4:00:11] <+Irridium> you can change the material on that
[4:00:14] <JordanDel95> you can change the material then it won't be just metal choices
[4:00:16] <+TheKnightMask> yo, this Barney custom is looking dope
[4:00:16] <$StynCity> if you switch it to another material other than metal it won't have to be a metal color
[4:00:18] <Alex_Eight> no u have to change the material
[4:00:19] <kungfooTitan> isnt that normal for customizations?
[4:00:19] <+queaks> change material first
[4:00:20] <+gantz_zero> it's ok, he'll get there @maskedriderhero
[4:00:21] <+dumemoto> Go back to black on the chest
[4:00:23] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus Metallic shaders limit your color selection
[4:00:26] <EASrake> You can change the texture to color it
[4:00:27] <krymzen5> does woolie like it?
[4:00:39] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @WoolieVersus change it to black
[4:00:39] <+badmr7> Whenever Woolie gets to customize any robot it should be called "Woolie's in the Garage"
[4:00:41] <waifoong98> Can't even custom tertiary to your liking, wot?
[4:00:47] <Dapper_Cactuar> I've been stuck for more than 5 minutes on the "connecting to online services" message
[4:00:49] <Kaneis> We're already too far in Woolie just keep going until they take away your crayons
[4:00:52] <%IMDRanged> Reminds me back in the day of miking an Argonian character in Skyrim
[4:00:53] <ValidVenasaur> maybe a darker purple for the belly
[4:00:54] <DSD24> @Spec7re I rememeber people telling me what they made and I just said "Ill stick with my cute bugs thank you"
[4:00:56] <DatAsuna> I highly advise just setting themto painted or plastic for you're going for @WoolieVersus
[4:00:59] <Norasuko_Art> Black works yeah
[4:01:05] <Norasuko_Art> it's neutral
[4:01:08] <+hashmalknight> Turn it to Woolie's stream and whats the first thing I see? Eva colors. Amazing
[4:01:09] <Zayasu> can you randomize?
[4:01:11] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus change the material to plastic or cloth
[4:01:12] <+Spec7re> Smart move @DSD24
[4:01:23] <UnfilteredComic> Change metal to fabric
[4:01:29] <+hashmalknight> I expected more green though
[4:01:34] <Norasuko_Art> Plastic looks like car paint
[4:01:40] <Norasuko_Art> so you see the color pure
[4:01:40] <loveplusearth> plasticñino
[4:01:42] <+VektorTroika> WooliEvangelion
[4:01:44] <Finakala> How's Destinyframe
[4:01:46] <+Grayhammatter> just make strike freedom gundam SeemsGood
[4:01:51] <+paladinstarbuster> EVA 01 is not yellow anywhere it has orange highlights. like BASKETBALL orange
[4:01:56] <+Spec7re> Lucio Eva
[4:02:04] <DSD24> Oh shit I should have made a Dom
[4:02:08] <krymzen5> oh no

[4:02:11] <$RilsRislan> oh no
[4:02:13] <+dumemoto> DAS IT
[4:02:13] <FacetiousAF> this has some insane customization
[4:02:17] <+NiktenKing> Yep it gets way different depending on materials used
[4:02:17] <DSD24> Dom Colors would look sick on this
[4:02:17] <+Spec7re> Yo that looks sick
[4:02:18] <Oncila> PogChamp o shit
[4:02:18] <+HostilePoundcakes> I SEE IT

[4:02:47] <+Spec7re> I see what you mean
[4:02:47] <Norasuko_Art> not bad
[4:02:49] <+Anonymasque> On my monitor it's the green that is off model from eva. I'm getting more of a green goblin vibe.

[4:03:24] <Kostas1001> spongebob announcer : 1 eternity latter
[4:03:26] <+paladinstarbuster> EVA 01 is not yellow anywhere it has orange highlights
[4:03:31] <Alex_Eight> i dont remember 01 having yellow at all
[4:03:31] <+queaks> unify the materials though
[4:03:34] <sileo_patronus> Let it rock and whatnot

[4:04:14] <@SoushinSen> I'm fine. Woolie does what Woolie does, and it's fun customizing.
[4:04:15] <+Grayhammatter> the highlights look orange to me
[4:04:21] <DSD24> Imagine you do good on your colors but then you colors on the back are all screwed up
[4:04:22] <$KnivesEve> can you put attachments like warframe on the javelins? for the looks i mean.
[4:04:25] <+Spec7re> Someone was like hey lets highlight the ass cheeks!
[4:04:27] <+Chitoman4> hope game dont crash and lose everything
[4:04:32] <@mothmandraws> woolie do secondary black, then the belly purple
[4:04:34] <@mothmandraws> might work well
[4:04:38] <SilverSnake55> IS IT JUST MY STREAM OR IS THE GAME STILL SHOWING UP AS AHEGAO ACADEMY
[4:04:39] <DSD24> @KnivesEve I think you get different parts for the Javelin
[4:04:43] <+queaks> apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon

[4:05:17] <%GohanEgret> @SilverSnake55 refresh the stream
[4:05:17] <SilverSnake55> THANKS

[4:05:56] <%UrsulaCat> BIG mistake
[4:05:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Thats the do it
[4:05:57] <sileo_patronus> There should really be a 'set all' option for both shaders and colours

[4:07:30] <+dumemoto> Don't forget to brand that shit up with vinyllogos
[4:07:32] <InsomniacPersona> Shotguns are bad apparently
[4:07:33] <ausl0> The Resolution is a solid choice
[4:07:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> shotty <3
[4:07:38] <$RilsRislan> He beat 2/5 of the game that matters
[4:07:39] <EASrake> Scout is p good
[4:07:41] <waifoong98> Also can't color weapons???
[4:07:46] <@mothmandraws> this is end game now
[4:07:51] <@mothmandraws> why do guns look so trash
[4:08:00] <Ropcord> beefy pistol for something in between
[4:08:00] <DatAsuna> I hate the gun looks in this
[4:08:02] <UnfilteredComic> Yeah coloring weapons would be cool
[4:08:03] <Parapattern> That RPM is off the gotdamn charts on the first gun on row 2
[4:08:03] <@mothmandraws> compared to armour quality you can start with
[4:08:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Cause they aren't EPICS
[4:08:12] <+NiktenKing> Sniper rifles are totally different from marksman rifles though
[4:08:14] <+gantz_zero> not currently @WoolieVersus
[4:08:16] <+Blankets_and_Tea> not in the demo at least
[4:08:17] <+mechslayer71> @mothmandraws cuz that’s what commons look like in these games
[4:08:18] <UnfilteredComic> No :(
[4:08:18] <InsomniacPersona> Prolly cuz they are commons
[4:08:19] <+queaks> Early game guns but yeah they arent great looking
[4:08:20] <@mothmandraws> ye but they look like they are covered in plastic bags
[4:08:25] <+Spec7re> Look at that stiched together gun
[4:08:27] <EASrake> These are TRASH guns held together with pieces of fabric
[4:08:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Yeah
[4:08:30] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> Weapons kind of look like ass.
[4:08:30] <+Irridium> I really wish the weapons would adopt your color scheme
[4:08:31] <InsomniacPersona> They are actually lol
[4:08:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> >crafting
[4:08:33] <waifoong98> Are they kidding me
[4:08:41] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[4:08:47] <+mechslayer71> Check out the vinyls, @woolieversus
[4:08:49] <+Grayhammatter> you just gotta find them
[4:08:51] <+gantz_zero> you'll get more options as you find more stuff while playing @WoolieVersus
[4:08:52] <+Irridium> you find a lot of this stuff in the world doing missions and stuff
[4:08:52] <+queaks> Again these are early game guns. Trash by design
[4:08:52] <ausl0> dat plastic bag on my gun sure makes me feel unique
[4:08:52] <+NiktenKing> You can get different everything. Those are your abilities
[4:08:54] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersus You find more
[4:08:54] <donaghy> loot drops
[4:08:56] <DatAsuna> yes but not now
[4:08:57] <EASrake> New stuff drops
[4:08:57] <Ropcord> they spent all their budget on the robots so they had to make their guns out of shovels and duct tape
[4:08:59] <+mechslayer71> All that stuff is loot, @woolieversus
[4:09:01] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Don't mispell Frag Grenades people
[4:09:02] <+Mikatonic> blinder
[4:09:14] <InsomniacPersona> you get different abilities and items to use from doing missions and stuff
[4:09:18] <ToastyBroDude> YOU DIDNT EQUIP SHIELD
[4:09:18] <@mothmandraws> there are guns in 40k slums that look more sci fi
[4:09:18] <+VektorTroika> Fraq grenades

[4:09:40] <DatAsuna> armour for this guy
[4:09:48] <%Piemen99> did the full game come out already?
[4:09:55] <Parapattern> Crafting seems ridiculous in this hyper-future game. Like they're benging together some scrap metal they found on the ground to make a weapon.
[4:09:56] <blackbookalpha> is this Black Desert Online?
[4:09:58] <DSD24> @Piemen99 Just the demo
[4:09:58] <ausl0> 22nd of February

[4:11:02] <%UrsulaCat> if you're a girl your robot is a boy that's how it works
[4:11:02] <DatAsuna> I feel like javelin should be a class
[4:11:04] <Ropcord> just fuck the robot

[4:11:18] <+VektorTroika> Time until the robot eats an enemy?
[4:11:19] <+Blankets_and_Tea> you can select freeplay from the mission menu, get in the javelin @WoolieVersus
[4:11:19] <+NiktenKing> Get inside your javelin
[4:11:19] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus getting in takes you to the menu
[4:11:21] <%the_sneak_> It'll open a menu when you hop in the suit
[4:11:22] <+mechslayer71> You do it from the mech @woolieversus
[4:11:22] <Chocolate_Burrito> the boy, Minty
[4:11:23] <+Fyre_link> going to the expedition takes you to the menu
[4:11:25] <InsomniacPersona> It looks rad!
[4:11:27] <ToastyBroDude> GET IN YOUR GUNDAM
[4:11:27] <DatAsuna> You freeplay from the exedition screen
[4:11:28] <s0nata_ii> looks lame
[4:11:28] <+Saggitori> @WoolieVersus Your eva is dummy thicc
[4:11:29] <+Grayhammatter> that yellow DansGame
[4:11:33] <pistachio_the_nut> LUL
[4:11:34] <Ropcord> SeemsGood
[4:11:36] <+mayatomr_> eva :V
[4:11:36] <%alrobot2014> the words start expedition are a bit misleading in this case
[4:11:37] <zamzoph> COOL ROBOT PogChamp
[4:11:37] <Laecerelius> Gotta shine!
[4:11:38] <waifoong98> platic yellow DansGame
[4:11:39] <Norasuko_Art> LOL your character must be such a douchebag
[4:11:41] <pistachio_the_nut> I wonder who the main character is
[4:11:42] <dekkitout> it looks like a missing texture LUL
[4:11:45] <Chocolate_Burrito> YEYEYE
[4:11:45] <vierleger> Looks great when not under harsh white lighting
[4:11:46] <+twohitgood> @WoolieVersus mardi gras colors!!
[4:11:48] <ToastyBroDude> OBNOXIOUS GUNDAM
[4:11:50] <+paladinstarbuster> its not yellow
[4:11:52] <AmericanaRed> lul
[4:11:53] <$Superdandy96> OH MY GOD, COLOR
[4:11:53] <+VektorTroika> Cruel EA's Thesis
[4:11:53] <@mothmandraws> this town starves to make this garish outfit
[4:11:57] <+Grayhammatter> we mardi gras up in here
[4:11:58] <%the_sneak_> Piloting a mech suit gives you a license to give zero fucks
[4:12:04] <Fabric_tester> I would have done a Wing Zero
[4:12:04] <Graxe_> Take refuge in the audacity of the bright colors.
[4:12:04] <+VietcongSamurai> This is my Action figure Javelin. :)
[4:12:04] <sidstyler> this game is weird though yeah, futuristic stuff but there's basically a castle there
[4:12:04] <DSD24> Wow that is a tight fit
[4:12:06] <blackbookalpha> dis UI
[4:12:06] <EASrake> one of THOSE freelancers
[4:12:08] <eyedol33> @WoolieVersus I'd recommend doing the missions with a full party. Gets you to 12 faster so you can try the other javelins.
[4:12:12] <%Rezca> I want better butt colors
[4:12:12] <@SoushinSen> Alright, Woolie, i sent you a party chat invite
[4:12:12] <+NightmareNemo> just as bad as Kamen Rider Ex-Aid LUL
[4:12:14] <+gantz_zero> so you need to invite him to your squad @WoolieVersus
[4:12:17] <quietshun> this ui bad
[4:12:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What if you spent all this time customing the Robot and then it gets stolen and you aren't allowed to replicate it Kappa
[4:12:18] <Valdorick> Man, humanity's survival seems hinged on having PERFECT EXOSUIT ASSCHEEKS
[4:12:24] <Parapattern> How often would you need to hose the inside of this thing out?
[4:12:27] <ToastyBroDude> javelin looking like a fucking action figure
[4:12:30] <blacksoap65> @WoolieVersus Wassup my island bredda
[4:12:33] <+Spec7re> Whos going to stop you from painting your super suit five shades of barney barf
[4:12:37] <sidstyler> nothing wrong with that imo
[4:12:40] <+CaptainTubaki> i cant get behind the idea of getting into something like that the fear of it shutting down on some way and getting stuck in a mass of metal scares me so much
[4:12:43] <blackbookalpha> microsoft blade ui vibes
[4:12:43] <UnfilteredComic> Dont press square
[4:12:47] <%the_sneak_> Step 1: Figure out the awful UI
[4:12:48] <sidstyler> it basically is designed to be an action figure anyway
[4:12:48] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> I should really get around to actually launching the demo.
[4:12:51] <+Grayhammatter> five shades of barney barf LUL
[4:12:59] <DatAsuna> also you can just hit triangle to forge from here
[4:13:00] <+gantz_zero> lol colossus
[4:13:04] <Valdorick> Also, how do your legs not break with the suit having digitigrade legs?
[4:13:06] <Ropcord> PogChamp
[4:13:06] <+gantz_zero> time for minh to show off
[4:13:09] <sidstyler> press the button on its back to pop out the melee weapon
[4:13:13] <@mothmandraws> write him a message
[4:13:13] <$RilsRislan> Time to get carried
[4:13:18] <Chocolate_Burrito> ayyy
[4:13:18] <+NiktenKing> Minh is in a colossus
[4:13:19] <$RilsRislan> Tell him, you love him

[4:13:22] <+Grayhammatter> ayyyy
[4:13:24] <+mechslayer71> Want some flying tips? @woolieversus

[4:15:57] <+gantz_zero> minh is rocking a Colossus @WoolieVersus
[4:15:59] <%shin_garbage> oh fuck, how longs Woolie been playing this. Does he hate it as much as everyone one else seems to?

[4:17:36] <Laecerelius> LOOK AT THAT CHONK!
[4:17:36] <%Life_of_Mamba> Woolie did you copy your hairstyle to look like killmonger from black panther
[4:17:38] <+millionstabz> @WoolieVersus If you mash your inventory button the game glitches and you lose HUD
[4:17:40] <Kaneis> STOMPSTOMP

[4:17:51] <%IMDRanged> Yeah, bring in that Monster Hunter World feels
[4:17:53] <$Superdandy96> Dang, Billy got a T H I C B O I
[4:17:56] <+gantz_zero> R3 = hover @WoolieVersus
[4:18:02] <+PunishedAwoo> woolie is cosplaying a EVA I see
[4:18:02] <Finakala> This game at least *looks* nice
[4:18:03] <+NiktenKing> Click R3 for Hover
[4:18:03] <zamzoph> IT'S MY TUUUUURN TO FLY
[4:18:04] <Kaneis> Flying is super good in this game when you're not on mouse/keyboard
[4:18:04] <InsomniacPersona> R3 to hover
[4:18:05] <+cvp5127> damn it him in
[4:18:18] <MyNameIsRasus> He typin
[4:18:19] <+gantz_zero> L3 in air = fly, R3 in air = hover @WoolieVersus
[4:18:21] <%IMDRanged> "Where did you learn to fly?"
[4:18:21] <Valdorick> Oh god, your legs, oh god, I can't, no, I just need to not think about how there's a person with bones in their legs in that mech.
[4:18:29] <InsomniacPersona> @WoolieVersus you overheat as you fly, so stick near water to keep it cooled
[4:18:31] <+lazylazzer> What's the gameplay loop of this game?
[4:18:40] <Parapattern> Toast those cheeks Woolie
[4:18:42] <@akuda_bar> @Valdorick they're on stilts, the digigrade part is the stilt
[4:18:43] <+Irridium> man, I really wish this game didn't have flying on a meter. Best part of the game and it limits it.
[4:18:46] <%Rezca> just pretend that the human is much smaller than the mech
[4:18:49] <EASrake> Jump dash jump dash
[4:18:49] <+mechslayer71> Fly low over water to counteract overheating, dive bomb to cool off, hold forward to go faster @woolieversus
[4:18:50] <ToastyBroDude> @Valdorick Do the bent legs disturb you lol
[4:18:53] <+arancet> bar on bottom is your heat, overheat = no fly, fly through water to cool off
[4:18:53] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersus Double Jump as well
[4:18:53] <+Spec7re> Look at that ASS
[4:18:58] <InsomniacPersona> Yep
[4:18:58] <+VektorTroika> @Valdorick the feet end at the reverse joint. it's like squatting the whole time
[4:19:00] <xBolts4Lifex> @JustSayAnything load fly load fly
[4:19:03] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus Water sources like lakes and rivers will keep your heat gauge. Waterfalls will cool you down completely
[4:19:04] <arkv01> is this literally armored core but powersuits
[4:19:04] <Koidragon1980> Boosters overheat. Water keeps it cool when u fly
[4:19:08] <UnfilteredComic> Its the meter
[4:19:11] <Kaneis> @JustSayAnything Missions, replay missions for loot, 4 player dungeons for loot
[4:19:13] <FackinCrazy> This just makes me want an Iron man game
[4:19:13] <sidstyler> I guess all your heatsinks are in your feet
[4:19:13] <+mechslayer71> There’s a bar
[4:19:18] <+gantz_zero> there's a bar under your reticle for overheating. no vertical options while hovering @WoolieVersus
[4:19:32] <+arancet> gotta fly to go up/down, cant do it in hover
[4:19:35] <MyNameIsRasus> It's the big meter that was smack dab in the middle of the screen before you cooled off
[4:19:35] <torontototoro> 1k viewers exactly!
[4:19:42] <@mothmandraws> I know its a gameplay thing
[4:19:45] <DSD24> @FackinCrazy There was the movie game a few years back
[4:19:46] <+Qsmash_> Do Fly Unfly combos
[4:19:48] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus also remember, there's diving in deep water
[4:19:50] <UnfilteredComic> Or just fly lol
[4:19:52] <$RilsRislan> oh no, is it monster hunter
[4:19:55] <@mothmandraws> but can you imagine a military allowing a system that only kept cool if used by rivers
[4:19:55] <%UrsulaCat> like minecraft
[4:19:56] <kuningaz45> what is this shit version of Warframe woolie
[4:19:58] <+Spec7re> See if you can air combo stuff
[4:20:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ??? just fly?
[4:20:03] <$StynCity> or you could just fly and point the camera up
[4:20:03] <Daxalog> The leaf village is under attack. lets gather some beans
[4:20:06] <Chocolate_Burrito> you can do it
[4:20:06] <UnfilteredComic> Just fly upwards my dude @WoolieVersus
[4:20:08] <Chocolate_Burrito> oof
[4:20:11] <+Mikatonic> yeah just grab that whole crystal cluster
[4:20:11] <+Fyre_link> you just fly up and then hit r3
[4:20:13] <+NiktenKing> Sprinting into jumps and flight is slightly faster
[4:20:15] <FackinCrazy> @DSD24 yeah it was cool for like half an hour
[4:20:15] <Kaneis> I wish there was a mantle feature in this game
[4:20:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> you can fly
[4:20:20] <@mothmandraws> "we built this tank, but you can only use it near waterfalls or it will overheat"
[4:20:20] <UnfilteredComic> LUL
[4:20:26] <pistachio_the_nut> LUL
[4:20:26] <+gantz_zero> fly and then hover for different height @WoolieVersus
[4:20:27] <Reanimator83> @valdorick the persons feet stop at the knees
[4:20:27] <+Bane_Kaikyo> just fly up stupid
[4:20:29] <DSD24> @FackinCrazy That's pretty much how it went
[4:20:31] <Toudeleski> Pull my metal trigger
[4:20:36] <Goraka91> Of course it's that colour LUL
[4:20:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> FLY UP STOOPIID
[4:20:38] <Deadpool2450> There a chatlog in this game? Or is it all voice com?
[4:20:40] <Parapattern> That is a SHORT hover time
[4:20:40] <+mechslayer71> You can fly upwards woolie @woolieversus
[4:20:42] <$RilsRislan> "We told every one to fly, for 30 seconds max"
[4:20:44] <Alex_Eight> u can fly up LUL
[4:20:45] <%GohanEgret> the fact there's overheating makes me far less interested in this
[4:20:46] <+VektorTroika> that's just a repulsor blast
[4:20:46] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus If you aim your gun while flying you'll switch to a hover. So you can fly for height and hover at the height you want.
[4:20:58] <Fabric_tester> Overheating is just a dumb mechanic
[4:20:59] <$SilverRoddo> It's the End of the World?!
[4:21:00] <DestroPrime83> This warframe update looks weird
[4:21:00] <@SoushinSen> Btw, i know you think the setup will be weird, but it's actually simple, if oyu join my party chat, you can hear me, but you don't have to talk to me. it won't change your stream setup
[4:21:13] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus Triangle is basic melee... but you can do a aerial slam with melee
[4:21:15] <+arancet> flying down also cools
[4:21:18] <%ohrly_> Flying straight down also cools you off @WoolieVersus
[4:21:18] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersus No fall damage either
[4:21:23] <$RilsRislan> Mihn wants you to be able to hear him
[4:21:32] <%the_sneak_> @WoolieVersus If you skim the water so you kick up a wake you'll cool while flying
[4:21:32] <sidstyler> at E3 they made it look like you could fly for a lot longer
[4:21:35] <+mechslayer71> Divebombing cools you off @woolieversus
[4:21:43] <+IamScorpius> BILLY HI @soushinsen
[4:21:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Does your mech come with a little knife? Kappa
[4:21:47] <donaghy> triangle
[4:21:48] <InsomniacPersona> @WoolieVersus Join Billy's party chat for his explanation!
[4:21:48] <+Fyre_link> triangle is melee
[4:21:50] <Toudeleski> What is this destiny ass destiny game
[4:21:50] <+SaltyStrudle> trianglwe
[4:21:50] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersus Triangle
[4:21:51] <+ExoByt3> Melee is triangle
[4:21:52] <stabbityrabbit> Is triangle.
[4:21:52] <+Irridium> melee is triangle
[4:21:53] <+Grayhammatter> triangle
[4:21:54] <+Spec7re> In the trailer is showed that Colossus have to hulk jump around which is what i want from them
[4:21:57] <+gantz_zero> @sidstyler you can, there's skill to it and upgrades and shit
[4:22:00] <MyNameIsRasus> @soushinsen hi Billy!
[4:22:03] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus Triangle is basic melee... do it from height wall falling to do a ground slam
[4:22:04] <sidstyler> more like a stun baton I think
[4:22:05] <Reanimator83> Triangle
[4:22:05] <Goraka91> @sidstyler That was like a full minute of flight or something
[4:22:05] <+gantz_zero> hold triangle for melee @WoolieVersus
[4:22:08] <Kaneis> It's the Detroit Fist on your screen
[4:22:08] <Koidragon1980> Flying downwards slows your overheating
[4:22:10] <s0nata_ii> boy this looks...
[4:22:10] <Finakala> BIG aims
[4:22:11] <InsomniacPersona> L3 to melee I believe
[4:22:13] <+gantz_zero> ranger melee is on a cooldown though because it '
[4:22:17] <AmericanaRed> ▲
[4:22:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Melee is only a thing if you are playing on Gamecube
[4:22:18] <+Fyre_link> you can ground pound with jump and triangle
[4:22:18] <MyNameIsRasus> Triangle
[4:22:21] <pistachio_the_nut> FeelsBadMan
[4:22:23] <+Spec7re> Destroy the ecosystem!
[4:22:26] <+mechslayer71> Triangle
[4:22:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> that boost seems like it'd give you whiplash
[4:22:32] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus melee s triangle, defaultman only has one hit and aerial. Cancel the jump into a dash to do the plunge melee faster
[4:22:32] <Toudeleski> How to unlock izuna drop?
[4:22:36] <sidstyler> I dunno I like mecha a lot but for some reason this game isn't quite doing it for me
[4:22:39] <Finakala> Jesus that bulletsponge
[4:22:43] <donaghy> melee has a bit of a dash attached aswell if there is a valid target
[4:22:58] <Koidragon1980> Hover and shoot
[4:22:58] <+Irridium> @WoolieVersus also each suit has its own melee. Interceptor's is a mild combo
[4:22:59] <+queaks> Fire intantly overheats
[4:23:01] <+gantz_zero> your abilities recharge -fast- btw @WoolieVersus
[4:23:06] <+mechslayer71> Yeah, this game is bulletspongy. Spam those abilities @woolieversus
[4:23:07] <@mothmandraws> billy abandonded you
[4:23:13] <%KaizenChaos> woolie hates animals confirmed
[4:23:17] <MyNameIsRasus> This looks extremely mediocre. like not great, but not bad.
[4:23:24] <+NiktenKing> Different types of damage are better against shields
[4:23:27] <dekkitout> that jobber's number must be bigger
[4:23:27] <+VektorTroika> Min tryna Warframe it
[4:23:32] <ArgentUndaCova> How does it control? The game feel good to play so far?
[4:23:33] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus also cooldown on missiles and grenades is pretty fast so use them liberally
[4:23:33] <+arancet> @WoolieVersus guns arent great damage... spam skills with r1 & L1
[4:23:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Billy doesn't have to edit your enemies anymore
[4:23:36] <$RilsRislan> That was my thought, Rasus
[4:23:38] <+AmanDotZip> Did he just vanish???????????
[4:23:39] <+paladinstarbuster> wow he jstbamfed
[4:23:39] <Press_Any> I thought this game was about robots
[4:23:39] <Finakala> That guy literally just disappeared
[4:23:40] <torontototoro> did that enemy just disappear??
[4:23:40] <$RilsRislan> Playing it is just the same
[4:23:44] <+gantz_zero> expect some bugs, it's rough around the edges @WoolieVersus
[4:23:45] <sidstyler> oh yeah enemies just kinda disappear sometimes that's good
[4:23:45] <zakor1138> He gone.
[4:23:47] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersus Use your ultimate, I think its up on the DPad
[4:23:48] <$RilsRislan> It's nothing great, but it's not bad.
[4:23:48] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Enemy just disappeared
[4:23:50] <Norasuko_Art> The robot voice even kinda sounds like Peter Dinklage in Destiny 1
[4:23:51] <+AmanDotZip> @Finakala LOL I KNEW IT
[4:23:51] <Press_Any> those are just dudes running around shooting
[4:23:57] <+trav2_> yeah it;s a bug, enemies will vanish

[4:30:17] <+thechungiestofbois> this game is BIG LAGS on console

[4:30:30] <$SilverRoddo> The hubris!
[4:30:33] <+mechslayer71> Fly low over water to counteract overheating. Divebombing cool you off. Press forward on right stick to fly faster @woolieversus
[4:30:34] <IndoorSitup> I've been playing this all day since yesterday and this game just seems like a boring, slow, buggy mess. I don't think this game'll get good reviews at launch.
[4:30:34] <%Rezca> @eddiemayfly thanks
[4:30:37] <$RilsRislan> The Lewd system
[4:30:45] <+Axellogic> Starting another mission usually fixes it
[4:30:47] <%GarbageNirvana> At least this game lets you pick your own colors
[4:30:49] <sidstyler> yeah I've said before I get Destiny vibes from it
[4:30:52] <+gantz_zero> 8 missiles, has to lock on before firing @WoolieVersus
[4:30:58] <Kaneis> I think the enemy design in Destiny is more refined than Anthem, the different factions have cool nuances to them
[4:30:58] <masterfire23> destiny 1 is a better game that destiny 2 SwiftRage
[4:31:00] <Adriangabs> you tag enemies with your ult then fire
[4:31:01] <+LuckyDingo> I loved the levels in Destiny 1, the levels in 2 were way smaller and boring imo
[4:31:04] <+mechslayer71> @indoorsitup Why’d you play it all day then? LUL
[4:31:11] <DatAsuna> Also if you only lock one enemy he takes all 8 of them
[4:31:14] <Bruh_itsTC> but are shaders gonna be consumable microtransactions tho? Kappa
[4:31:16] <dekkitout> so does no one else remember borderlands or is the mandela effect in full swing
[4:31:25] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersus Hold square to change weapons
[4:31:27] <+paladinstarbuster> Its aa shooter woolz
[4:31:28] <donaghy> @WoolieVersus melee then r1 or l1 for shock combo
[4:31:31] <IndoorSitup> I wanted experience everything first.
[4:31:32] <Finakala> This landscape looks very Borderlandsy
[4:31:34] <+AmanDotZip> maybe this is one of those games where hard mode is the real made?
[4:31:37] <+AmanDotZip> mode*
[4:31:39] <%EldritchBee> Woolz youve been out of ammo for ages
[4:31:47] <Adriangabs> This is more Mass Effect MMO than Borderlands IMP
[4:31:52] <Adriangabs> IMO*
[4:31:54] <torontototoro> space doggos?
[4:31:58] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus ammo is those turquoise drops from enemies
[4:32:01] <psudonym> EVA Unit Woolie?
[4:32:05] <Koidragon1980> If you are on pro then set to 1080p no supersampling. Will improve fps.
[4:32:12] <Goraka91> For real though who is interested in The Division 2? Who wants Destiny/Anthem but boring?
[4:32:24] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Freeplay does have some random world events
[4:32:28] <1MadLadd> robot doggos CrreamAwk CrreamAwk CrreamAwk
[4:32:30] <+VektorTroika> Queue line enthusiasts
[4:32:37] <badnewsmike> @Ariksgabs was thinking the same thing ma
[4:32:43] <DatAsuna> Red isn't the ammo
[4:32:43] <badnewsmike> **man whoops
[4:32:50] <+Grayhammatter> whoa
[4:32:51] <+zeysantoz> i skinned my Interceptor EVA style too. I found the pastel purple to look sick
[4:32:59] <+Grayhammatter> F
[4:33:01] <UnfilteredComic> Colossus ult is so cool
[4:33:01] <Ropcord> F
[4:33:03] <@akuda_bar> @Goraka91 only because i live in dc and i wanna run around in it, that's literally the entire reason
[4:33:04] <@mothmandraws> explosions everywhere
[4:33:05] <+VektorTroika> Red is for health, but the bar is green?
[4:33:08] <InsomniacPersona> Health packs
[4:33:15] <DatAsuna> Interceptor ult is underwhelming
[4:33:17] <ZimmiZ> is that billy?
[4:33:22] <DatAsuna> Health and shields
[4:33:22] <Goraka91> @akuda_bar Oh that would be pretty neat (if it's accurate)
[4:33:23] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus Don't forget you have an actual dodge button apart from your flying and hovering. You can basically move like Dante.
[4:33:30] <+zeysantoz> interceptor ult is deadly af if youre good @DatAsuna
[4:33:31] <torontototoro> @ZimmiZ yeah
[4:33:33] <sidstyler> oooh that was cool
[4:33:42] <ZimmiZ> torontototoro thanks :)
[4:33:43] <DatAsuna> @zeysantoz I said underwhelming, not weak
[4:33:44] <dekkitout> i personally like a tom clancy branded mmo -ghost recon wildlands? never heard of it... Kappa -
[4:33:49] <+mechslayer71> You have dodge on circle @woolieversus
[4:33:54] <DatAsuna> It's useful, just not cool
[4:33:57] <Goraka91> Also RIP Tom Clancy
[4:34:04] <+zeysantoz> @DatAsuna it could use more visual flair
[4:34:05] <dekkitout> very RiP
[4:34:07] <IndoorSitup> Flaws with the game so far: Open world is pretty samey. Movement feels pretty sluggish. Using the same 3 abilities over and over again each missions gets old fast. Motion blur is eye meltingly bad. The guns all feel pretty limp
[4:34:19] <IndoorSitup> AND BUGS, SO MANY BUGS
[4:34:23] <@mothmandraws> is there no lock on btw?
[4:34:23] <Adriangabs> Division has the least interesting setting for me, why be a government agent when you can be a Space Ninja or Iron Man
[4:34:32] <Bamboo_Bushido> This game just looks so meh
[4:34:34] <+PodcastPrimate> @dekkitout this is wildlands with ironman and borderlands smashed up
[4:34:37] <$RilsRislan> There's a soft lock on abilities
[4:34:38] <@mothmandraws> wouldnt that make certain high speed fights tricky
[4:34:44] <Goraka91> Putting a dead man's name on random video games seems...
[4:34:47] <+HelloImTom08> 3rd person is alwasy better
[4:34:50] <DatAsuna> I wish the abilities had more charges/alt fire versions like andromeda
[4:34:53] <+predac0n> Ineats od foring a war between Div & Anthem just accept both as good looter shooters and let it go
[4:34:56] <+NiktenKing> Yeah 3rd person is amazing
[4:35:04] <+PodcastPrimate> i hated 3rd oerson games til this.
[4:35:05] <Smileyhat> In what way does movement feel sluggish? It does in the hub maybe, but you can be super agile in this game.
[4:35:09] <+gantz_zero> some of us like either
[4:35:09] <zamzoph> you want to see your space doll
[4:35:10] <%Piemen99> understandable
[4:35:14] <Ropcord> Ever going to do Warframe on stream now that part 2 is definitely never going to happen? @WoolieVersus
[4:35:14] <+NiktenKing> Even people who play Destiny 2 and get the 3rd person glitch say it looks better
[4:35:17] <+HelloImTom08> looks are the most important, good look badass, desitiny its like ok my glvoes look cool i guess
[4:35:18] <RIPRevenant> @WoolieVersus SAME, i love destiny, but HATE that there's no third person mode in it
[4:35:22] <Bruh_itsTC> put purple and green on mah screen, or it aint for me
[4:35:26] <+Grayhammatter> woolie wants to see his eva
[4:35:26] <+predac0n> Movement feels like absolute trash on PC
[4:35:26] <+PodcastPrimate> @smileyhat depemds on suit your in
[4:35:29] <Kaneis> @Ariksgabs I think it's an immersive experience, the NYC map of the first game is beautiful -- but I love D2 more because the actual gameplay is just more fun
[4:35:33] <Alex_Eight> yeah but you get better shooting mechanics with FPS
[4:35:34] <+paladinstarbuster> BIG CHEW
[4:35:38] <+zeysantoz> this game feels amazing in 21:9 ultrawide
[4:35:43] <+gantz_zero> @NiktenKing both are fine, don't pretend like one is superior
[4:35:44] <DestroPrime83> 3rd persons great when the camera and movement arent absolute shit like a couple games ive played
[4:35:45] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus just a reminder, you'll take much longer to unlock the melee/ninja javelin by not doing missions
[4:35:52] <Goraka91> Some games are better First Person, like Doom
[4:35:56] <InsomniacPersona> I personally hate the amount of shaking there is when you fly around and theres no option to fix that
[4:35:57] <dekkitout> my time in d2 taught me to love how much this busted gun kills everything that looks at you funny
[4:36:00] <MonstarGrrrl> oh noooo
[4:36:00] <UnfilteredComic> Stream Lag?
[4:36:02] <+Kingjhon8> did the stream die?
[4:36:04] <JobbedBone> lag
[4:36:05] <torontototoro> yeah big lag
[4:36:08] <NeedlesD> dropping tons of frames
[4:36:09] <UnfilteredComic> Nvm its good now
[4:36:10] <Finakala> Big lags
[4:36:12] <@akuda_bar> refresh
[4:36:12] <FacetiousAF> stream shat a bit
[4:36:13] <Goraka91> Oh not my internet then
[4:36:14] <@Solidus_113> stream video breaking
[4:36:15] <InsomniacPersona> Stream is fixed
[4:36:18] <+Irridium> yeah I had to reload it
[4:36:19] <+Grayhammatter> a e s t h e t i c
[4:36:19] <dekkitout> still better than fo76 somehow...
[4:36:19] <krymzen5> woolies interwebs can't handle
[4:36:20] <Bruh_itsTC> wait theres no camera shake option? i reallllly wish there was
[4:36:20] <Deadpool2450> ooof the game is shitting the stream a bit
[4:36:21] <Joysta> its k now
[4:36:22] <@mothmandraws> ye gotta refresh
[4:36:26] <+NiktenKing> @gantz_zero Not really, people who like roaming supers and do the glitch think it's better
[4:36:26] <+Kingjhon8> f5 fixed it
[4:36:26] <IndoorSitup> I usually never care about the way my guy looks so first person has never bothered me.
[4:36:29] <+Grayhammatter> F
[4:36:30] <+AlvinTheLiar> Is Woolie playing on a console or computer?
[4:36:31] <sidstyler> oh no dryads!
[4:36:33] <Smileyhat> @PodcastPrimate I picked up the infiltrator and absolutely love the mobility on it. Wish I could give the others a try too, but I'm pretty sure that's what I'm going with.
[4:36:33] <zamzoph> local rape gang
[4:36:36] <Joysta> fixed itself
[4:36:39] <Reanimator83> Hate the fact you can’t switch shoulders when shooting in this.
[4:36:40] <@Solidus_113> @AlvinTheLiar ps4
[4:36:41] <NeedlesD> Console, PS4 Alvin
[4:36:42] <DestroPrime83> If stream lags pause it for a second and it'll auto refresh without losing chat
[4:36:44] <AmericanaRed> HSWP WutFace
[4:36:46] <+AlvinTheLiar> Thanks
[4:36:57] <+urbnbuddha> How did you people in chat like this game demo in general?
[4:37:02] <AmericanaRed> PogChamp PogChamp
[4:37:03] <+Irridium> eh
[4:37:03] <+mechslayer71> Hovering really isn’t worth it tbh, outside certain instances @woolieversus
[4:37:05] <Goraka91> Wait you can't switch shoulders? In a modern Third Person Shooter? NotLikeThis
[4:37:10] <+zeysantoz> @Smileyhat once you have the muscle memory down, interceptor feels the best to play viscerally. but storm damage is crazy
[4:37:21] <Norasuko_Art> gotta go, thanks for streaming Woolz
[4:37:26] <Norasuko_Art> see yall everyone
[4:37:27] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you can't cancel jump ascenion with the melee, but you can with a dash. Jump dash melee will often come out faster
[4:37:34] <%alrobot2014> seeya!
[4:37:38] <waifoong98> @Norasuko_Art bye
[4:37:41] <+thechungiestofbois> by nora
[4:37:43] <kevon209209> Is the game any good? Head controversy around Anthem
[4:37:45] <DatAsuna> I wish it didn't tbh
[4:37:46] <+Lixagon> so how are you enjoying FrameEffect?
[4:37:48] <+Lixagon> LUL
[4:37:49] <kevon209209> *heard
[4:37:49] <+NiktenKing> Hovering is super worth if you are gonna ult cause you want to do a missile circus on people from above like pharah
[4:37:52] <Fabric_tester> Keep saying it overheating is such a stupid mechanic
[4:37:53] <DatAsuna> I would rrather fire at full speed
[4:37:54] <%blaccbird914> See ya nora
[4:37:58] <IndoorSitup> The mobility for the Interceptor is fun to mess around with at first but just like the flying it gets old fast.
[4:38:04] <%1tsblt> hovering is super important for storm , it buffs its shield
[4:38:04] <+mechslayer71> Flowing low over water basically lets you fly forever @woolieversus
[4:38:05] <releasethehounds0> fuck it play Team Fortress 2
[4:38:06] <+zeysantoz> jump -> fly -> melee -> dodge -> fly -> repeat is a good chain
[4:38:06] <+TeethMuncher> @urbnbuddha nothing really stood out as special and the ui was really clunky. My ultrawide resolution was supported so that was nice
[4:38:10] <viciousgrim> is he on pc or console?
[4:38:15] <kevon209209> console
[4:38:16] <+IamScorpius> apathyHype apathyHype apathyHype apathyHype apathyHype
[4:38:25] <+mechslayer71> @viciousgrim Ps4
[4:38:26] <Goraka91> Overheating is anti-fun yes
[4:38:31] <EASrake> If you start a mission you will get properly leveled enemies
[4:38:34] <BuffaTV> Trust the Billy
[4:38:44] <+zeysantoz> @TeethMuncher so glad ultrawide was supported
[4:38:45] <Parapattern> Microtransactions to minimize the overheating
[4:38:48] <CirclesForever> pretty uge
[4:38:48] <DestroPrime83> wait is this just the demo?
[4:38:51] <viciousgrim> @mechslayer71 thanks
[4:38:53] <DatAsuna> yup
[4:38:56] <ToxInjection> it's pretty YUGE
[4:38:59] <dekkitout> the lack of hud elements in the lower left is the bad kind of eye catching for me
[4:39:01] <+VektorTroika> r i p s t r e a m s
[4:39:05] <DatAsuna> It's also got some really big underwater levels
[4:39:08] <+gantz_zero> even planes have a maximum vertical height @WoolieVersus
[4:39:10] <Smileyhat> @zeysantoz I'll believe it, though I haven't seen more than one storm in the time I was playing so far. But just jumping and dashing in for melee attacks then back out to shotgun has been a lot of fun.
[4:39:12] <Flarepulse> Woolie's skin-tight mech ass
[4:39:14] <DestroPrime83> which demo, someone have a bullshit chart to explain it to me?
[4:39:14] <+urbnbuddha> I hate when you get downed and can't respawn. If you go down in a bad spot the group has no way to get to you it can take a while. Feels like a waste
[4:39:15] <GittinBizy> this channel g rated as well?
[4:39:17] <+mechslayer71> Divebombing cools you off @woolieversus
[4:39:24] <Goldenwolf98> I feel like the overheat should only be regulated to the hovering let us fly for as long as we want
[4:39:29] <+Blankets_and_Tea> @BaronVonDickButt this is the open demo, available to everyone
[4:39:29] <DatAsuna> the public demo
[4:39:32] <MyNameIsRasus> big YUGE
[4:39:41] <+zeysantoz> @WoolieVersus to avoid overheating, fly by waterfalls/rain or fly in a up/down motion. im sure theres heat reducing items lin the main game
[4:39:41] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus There are also dungeons and secret instanced zones
[4:39:41] <+queaks> Woolie there is a dropped item on the mining platform
[4:39:50] <IndoorSitup> Overall the game feels like a more sluggish and repetitive version of Warframe. I don't think this game will get reviewed well at launch.
[4:39:55] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus diving under deep water aso instantlly cools you completely
[4:40:01] <InsomniacPersona> You can exit expedition in menu I believe to quickly go back to hub town
[4:40:09] <+urbnbuddha> @TeethMuncher feeling the same. And it feels so empty
[4:40:14] <Goraka91> Kinda like the GW2 Griffon huh
[4:40:32] <DestroPrime83> Anyone else here just to laugh and ridicule this game and EA?
[4:40:34] <arkv01> fuck this is the armored core I always wanted
[4:40:38] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you also cool faster and overheat slower by following streams and waterfalls
[4:40:41] <ToxInjection> wait holy FUCK I didn't think about diving to cool down
[4:40:46] <+jorgamund> GW2 griffon can't regain the same altitude as pre-dive, though
[4:40:52] <+urbnbuddha> Ugh I'd love a new armored core
[4:40:53] <releasethehounds0> To be fair you have to have a really high IQ to prefer Anthem over Warframe
[4:40:56] <Adriangabs> Iron Manning your way through the world is fun but it overheats too quickly
[4:41:01] <+mechslayer71> @toxinjection Yeah, I found it by accident. It’s fucking cool
[4:41:07] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus yes to your right
[4:41:11] <Goraka91> @jorgamund Yeah just the whole 'go up and down to go further' stuff
[4:41:11] <arkv01> this is armored core now
[4:41:13] <+paladinstarbuster> Wow woolz
[4:41:14] <$RilsRislan> "The fun thing is fun, but they made it not fun"
[4:41:14] <arkv01> living its best life
[4:41:18] <DatAsuna> You can stay in the air a long time if you know where the water is
[4:41:34] <$Avolver001> there's mods to extend flight time
[4:41:39] <+urbnbuddha> I can't picture a mech from titan fall in this setting
[4:41:40] <$Avolver001> i think
[4:41:47] <CirclesForever> how does onw win this game?
[4:41:49] <+VektorTroika> Halo brutes have command grabs confirmed
[4:41:51] <+jorgamund> @Goraka91 maybe I've done it wrong, but I never notice a horizontal difference between just mashing "flap" and the dive on GW2 griffons
[4:41:54] <torontototoro> little laggies
[4:42:00] <IndoorSitup> Flying is cool at first but it gets old thanks to how slowly you fly and the fact that the open world is so empty. After a while flying from A to B starts yo feel like a chore, especially with the overheating system.
[4:42:01] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus There's deep diving spots around the fort you can deploy from. Flying tot he fort before ending freeplay might help learn the area better
[4:42:01] <DestroPrime83> so why the fuck did they make a flight system based on where water is to stay cool?
[4:42:01] <tloa> fucking hell, they made an overheating system in the game?
[4:42:03] <+Blankets_and_Tea> @WoolieVersus make sure to use your abilities as much as you can. the guns are more of a compliment to your abilities rather than the other way around
[4:42:05] <releasethehounds0> Tbh this Earth looks better than warframe earth
[4:42:09] <%CptnCampy61> This gun doesn’t seem super impactful
[4:42:12] <dekkitout> iirc some promo footage had a "Hey this is the final zone/level" that was the obligatory lava map, so flying there must be fuuun~
[4:42:15] <MyNameIsRasus> Min looks like a Big Daddy
[4:42:16] <InsomniacPersona> Btw @WoolieVersus your main damage comes from combos, your melee primes a target, and then your rocket or nade combos it, dealing big damage
[4:42:22] <Adriangabs> 3rd person Titanfall would be neat though
[4:42:29] <+mechslayer71> Try using ult while flying to carpet bomb guys. True Ironman shit @woolieversus
[4:42:35] <Parapattern> I don't remember so much diving and having to cool off so often during flying in the gameplay trailer
[4:42:37] <+Mikatonic> yeah, just keep shooting the shield
[4:42:43] <UnfilteredComic> @CptnCampy61 Yea the gun arent great, the abilities are super satisfying tho
[4:42:45] <%1tsblt> hope he gets the detonator sniper
[4:42:49] <%1tsblt> i love that thing
[4:42:51] <MyNameIsRasus> We really just want a AAA mech game
[4:42:55] <EASrake> Flying near water also cools you
[4:42:56] <DatAsuna> @InsomniacPersona combos is a good tip, copy paste that when he's out of combat
[4:42:57] <Goraka91> @jorgamund Oh might be doing it wrong then, you need to do a hard dive by holding another button (think default is space) which gives you a massive speed boost
[4:43:01] <+gantz_zero> @Hallommig that thing does insane damage
[4:43:01] <%Rezca> needs more ability spam
[4:43:02] <+NiktenKing> There's an automatic sniper rifle that is pretty cool

[4:43:09] <ToxInjection> Using ults in midair is THE easiest way to feel like Iron Man sans just flying around

[4:43:41] <+TeethMuncher> @TheMorilo Psh, it's Frame of Destiny
[4:43:44] <IndoorSitup> This game also has an abundance of annoying enemies that are not fun to fight. It's madr worse with how bullet spongy the enemies tend to be.

[4:44:35] <InsomniacPersona> Btw @WoolieVersus your main damage comes from combos, your melee primes a target, and then your rocket or nade combos it, dealing big damage!
[4:44:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat you missed yourself kicking the shit out of Zubaz and failing to summon a persona
[4:44:36] <releasethehounds0> Don't mod pat. He can't handle the power.
[4:44:40] <IndoorSitup> Also this motion blur is vomit inducing, it looks so fucking bad.
[4:44:42] <+PatStaresAt> Hows Woolz liking it?
[4:44:43] <+SuichiTanaka> It's important to get play data though. It means you guys can talk about it informed on the podcast

[4:49:52] <$RilsRislan> "This isn't representative of the final game in all the bad ways"
[4:49:58] <zamzoph> modern bioware character design DansGame
[4:49:59] <+thecosmicfly> How did dialogue options manage to regress even more than Fallout 4. How is this possible.
[4:50:02] <+gantz_zero> @DatAsuna he got a weapon for a different suit
[4:50:04] <Dg10262> Oof I do not want to play this game
[4:50:06] <DatAsuna> das interceptor
[4:50:10] <Parapattern> 25 C O I N
[4:50:16] <+gantz_zero> @WoolieVersus you got a gun for a colossus
[4:50:18] <Goraka91> ''All vanity items in the demo cost 25 coin'' WTF does that mean? DansGame
[4:50:19] <waifoong98> weapon by suit class DansGame
[4:50:19] <+Kilik_> one of the worst non crashing bugs is a hp bug where your max health just randomly lowers by a lot, really screws the colossus javelin especially @WoolieVersus
[4:50:21] <DatAsuna> coin is the lamest currency name
[4:50:22] <$RilsRislan> I went straight into a mission and didn't do freeplay and came out bored.
[4:50:24] <IndoorSitup> Also only TWO dialogue options. LUL
[4:50:30] <+Axellogic> You got a grenade launcher that you cant use
[4:50:31] <TheMeromex> i come in and immediatky see an EVA on the screen
[4:50:33] <+Fyre_link> do machine pistol
[4:50:34] <Osetto> Machine Pistols are the better close quarters weapons.
[4:50:37] <eyedol33> @thecosmicfly cuz its not that type of game?
[4:50:40] <+gantz_zero> @waifoong98 no, heavy weapons are just exclusive to colossus, nothing else is
[4:50:43] <SGrim> Anthem shitfest? Did I miss the pile-party?
[4:50:45] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:50:46] <+gantz_zero> stop the misinformation holy shit
[4:50:49] <MyNameIsRasus> I think gold is worse than coin
[4:50:50] <waifoong98> @gantz_zero still tho that's lame
[4:50:53] <DatAsuna> damage per pellet
[4:50:55] <UnfilteredComic> per bullet damage
[4:50:55] <MayorRev> thank u bot
[4:51:00] <+mechslayer71> Pellets
[4:51:00] <EASrake> per pellet
[4:51:00] <+queaks> cause it shoot 12 pelets ot 1
[4:51:02] <eyedol33> The damage is what each pellet does
[4:51:03] <blacksoap65> billlllly
[4:51:04] <SGrim> Wow Billies loud
[4:51:06] <Archer27> He got a grenade launcher, but only colossus (another javelin) can equip those. And the next javelins come with leveling up. But good luck getting exp in anything but the stronghold (the only repeatable mission).
[4:51:06] <dekkitout> its relative damage like destiny guns
[4:51:11] <+Yokuho> Thanks doc
[4:51:13] <@mothmandraws> but how many pellets you get
[4:51:20] <masterfire23> @woolieversus you will definitely like the interceptor
[4:51:22] <$RilsRislan> If you're going to tell us damage per pellet, then show us a fucking spread pattern.
[4:51:22] <+Noxyba> They understate the damage for some reason. I don't think it's per pellet necessarily
[4:51:25] <+NiktenKing> Dicking?
[4:51:27] <Goraka91> Full price games don't need a cash shop, it's fine with Warframe because it's free
[4:51:28] <IIChampagne> EA Unit 1
[4:51:29] <Parapattern> These guns look like they're made out of scrap and toilet paper
[4:51:30] <%GarbageNirvana> A literal DPS number would be nice
[4:51:33] <Valdorick> Soon we'll be playing Triple A games that are just the Tree of Dreams from Neir, but there's not even a multiple choice question. It just brings up a prompt every 5 paragraphs to make sure you're still there paying attention to the story.
[4:51:35] <+TeethMuncher> Click & Dick
[4:51:46] <@mothmandraws> the game audio in general is a tad loud
[4:51:49] <arkv01> billy you're fine man, be proud of that loud
[4:51:50] <@mothmandraws> id drop it just a little
[4:51:54] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus You can access the forge from inside your javelin
[4:52:00] <EASrake> One guy
[4:52:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Minh is INSIDE THE GAME
[4:52:03] <+NiktenKing> Yep
[4:52:07] <+Kilik_> one of the worst non crashing bugs is a hp bug where your max health just randomly lowers by a lot, really screws the colossus javelin especially @WoolieVersus
[4:52:08] <+gael_j> Billy go down
[4:52:08] <IndoorSitup> I can tell this game is gonna be hoy garbage.
[4:52:19] <torontototoro> Billy needs to Minh-max his character
[4:52:22] <IndoorSitup> *hot
[4:52:27] <%GarbageNirvana> If Minh dies in the game does he die for real
[4:52:30] <The_Blumper> hey does this suck?
[4:52:33] <$RilsRislan> You can also bet this game isn't going to see nearly as much post-launch attention as Desinty
[4:52:34] <@mothmandraws> health % increase ew
[4:52:35] <Goraka91> 3100% WutFace
[4:52:38] <TheGr8ChefNick> I finally got around to following Woolie heck yes
[4:52:39] <DestroPrime83> ill be honest I kinda want Woolie to lose connection half way through
[4:52:41] <Finakala> 3100%??
[4:52:45] <+TeethMuncher> @GarbageNirvana the suit lives on thougj
[4:52:47] <+NiktenKing> Max difficulty is 3.1k percent harder
[4:52:48] <DestroPrime83> just for the Lulz
[4:52:58] <+Zeromalley> But when do we unlock Grandmaster Flash difficulty?
[4:53:01] <Adriangabs> Billy was just trying to help, okay? BibleThump
[4:53:04] <releasethehounds0> Hey woolie can I have an N word pass
[4:53:06] <Valdorick> Its getting Diablo 3 levels of "harder content"
[4:53:10] <+gantz_zero> minh needs to ready up @WoolieVersus
[4:53:16] <@mothmandraws> 3.1k% harder is just making it slower if its just hp numbers
[4:53:17] <+gantz_zero> or did
[4:53:17] <MyNameIsRasus> This game is actually not awful. Which is a shame because "not awful" doesn't stack up with the competition it's got
[4:53:19] <+Kilik_> difficulty increase = more sponginess
[4:53:19] <waifoong98> D3 LUL
[4:53:20] <@mothmandraws> vs giving them more moves
[4:53:29] <$RilsRislan> 25 Coin
[4:53:36] <+krispen_wa> Mediocrity is less fun to watch than a trashfire
[4:53:45] <+MagicBeanBurrito> You what?
[4:53:47] <Shisno27> I feel like everyone trying so hard to say the game sucks didn't actually play it or the funner classes
[4:53:48] <+mechslayer71> @mothmandraws That’s exactly what it is LUL destiny ass destiny
[4:53:49] <$RilsRislan> yup
[4:53:51] <Skatedeandre> greetings
[4:54:01] <+Lixagon> LUL
[4:54:01] <releasethehounds0> How does chat feel about Warframe's enemie Armor scaling
[4:54:02] <$RilsRislan> It's controller friendly
[4:54:02] <dekkitout> so pharah?
[4:54:02] <+gantz_zero> simple in concept but a lot of options @WoolieVersus
[4:54:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Air movement on consoles doesn't need to be any more complex than Star Fox imo
[4:54:08] <waifoong98> @releasethehounds0 TRASH
[4:54:09] <$RilsRislan> hehehe
[4:54:09] <DestroPrime83> @Kilik_ like The Division? just spong those bullets like its shooting candy
[4:54:10] <Quivla> when you get the interceptor the movement gets more complicated
[4:54:11] <HitchhikingThrough> Most likely
[4:54:14] <Skatedeandre> ive come from a lady with butthole problems
[4:54:15] <+Lixagon> Aint no spaceNinja
[4:54:17] <+mechslayer71> You can dodge while flying @woolieversus also do your ult while flying
[4:54:17] <MyNameIsRasus> a 0 is indeed better than a 5
[4:54:18] <@mothmandraws> id rather they added like 10x amount of enemies on screen than increase hp for everything
[4:54:18] <+NiktenKing> Interceptor has triple vector dash and jumps
[4:54:20] <HitchhikingThrough> EWWWW
[4:54:26] <@mothmandraws> more threats for me is more interesting than hp spong
[4:54:27] <$RilsRislan> The Main Character and the Side Characters
[4:54:32] <@mothmandraws> let me fight 200 things
[4:54:34] <Skatedeandre> ah yes the woolie javelin
[4:54:36] <+fredviii1454> FYI. if you crash out of a mission, just go into freeplay and exit out of it. You should get all the rewards you picked up.
[4:54:37] <+gantz_zero> fun @WoolieVersus
[4:54:37] <dekkitout> one of these things is not like the other
[4:54:40] <+MagicBeanBurrito> OHNO
[4:54:42] <DatAsuna> RIP
[4:54:42] <@mothmandraws> banned for team killing
[4:54:43] <InsomniacPersona> LUL
[4:54:44] <$RilsRislan> Was that Lightning?
[4:54:44] <+Grayhammatter> UH
[4:54:45] <Adriangabs> D:
[4:54:46] <eyedol33> lol no. Warframe movement is very simple.
[4:54:46] <london_flexing> APPLES and ORANGES tho
[4:54:50] <UnfilteredComic> No its weather
[4:54:51] <+Kingjhon8> that's not a flair, that's a grenade
[4:54:51] <EASrake> Lightning storm
[4:54:52] <The_Blumper> OKAY BUZZ LIGHTYEAR
[4:54:52] <+gantz_zero> that was just a lightning strike @WoolieVersus
[4:54:52] <+Grayhammatter> woolie please LUL
[4:54:55] <+queaks> Hit by lightning
[4:54:58] <HitchhikingThrough> Warframe at least has the missions open with each player doing something different
[4:54:58] <donaghy> lightning strike is random weather
[4:54:58] <DatAsuna> Lightning happens with the weather
[4:55:00] <waifoong98> enemy armor scaling in warframe breaks dmg balancing @releasethehounds0
[4:55:02] <Shisno27> woolie that was not you
[4:55:07] <Skatedeandre> flying has a cooldown...
[4:55:11] <+Kingjhon8> oh nvm
[4:55:18] <InsomniacPersona> OH its lightning from the heavy rainstorm @WoolieVersus
[4:55:20] <releasethehounds0> when did Volt get this new skin lol
[4:55:25] <+mechslayer71> Fly low over water to stay cool @woolieversus
[4:55:26] <+NiktenKing> Weather changes the map. Day and night cycle changes the spawns and enemy activity
[4:55:27] <dekkitout> enemy armor scaling is trivial with the right weapon/ability
[4:55:31] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus diveable water will look darker, bridges .etc are also a good indictator of deeper water
[4:55:36] <+NiktenKing> Rain also cools down your heat gauge
[4:55:41] <Valdorick> Like when my friend's Limbo checks out my Mesas ass... All because the game is focusing on another friend's Ivara slink out a vent, also showing off her ass.
[4:55:42] <Finakala> Loading NOW?
[4:55:46] <$KnivesEve> is that mihn?
[4:55:46] <$RilsRislan> Loadframe
[4:55:47] <+MagicBeanBurrito> YEYEYEYEY
[4:55:47] <%alrobot2014> oh this tunnel
[4:55:48] <InsomniacPersona> Loading into a dungeon
[4:55:50] <$RilsRislan> gotta enter this instance
[4:55:53] <IndoorSitup> MAN ISN'T THIS OVERHEAT MECHANIC FUN?
[4:55:54] <DatAsuna> IT does the halo thing
[4:55:54] <%alrobot2014> fuck this tiny tunnel
[4:55:56] <@mothmandraws> the loading screens are the bosses
[4:55:57] <+Kilik_> this game has TONS of loading screens
[4:55:57] <InsomniacPersona> @KnivesEve yea its Billy
[4:55:58] <eyedol33> lol its fine chill
[4:56:02] <$RilsRislan> They can enter the tunnel
[4:56:03] <$KnivesEve> HI BILLY
[4:56:04] <Skatedeandre> they can go in whenever they want
[4:56:04] <$RilsRislan> as they want
[4:56:05] <+LogothX> the most deadly enemy loading
[4:56:07] <@mothmandraws> can you defeat the next one
[4:56:07] <EASrake> They will come its fine
[4:56:10] <DestroPrime83> god the cooling system is kinda dumb
[4:56:17] <$RilsRislan> They're probably lost in the map
[4:56:19] <Adriangabs> people will come in in the middle of the mission
[4:56:22] <+gantz_zero> @IndoorSitup man isn't game progression and upgrading to have better shit fun
[4:56:22] <+Lixagon> in mission loading screens in 2019 LUL
[4:56:23] <$RilsRislan> cuz the Objective marker is dogshit
[4:56:29] <+mechslayer71> Fly low over water to stay cool @woolieversus
[4:56:31] <@mothmandraws> the cooling system is strange lore wise
[4:56:36] <$RilsRislan> It's way too close to the mission marker
[4:56:39] <JooseNeck> How is this game so far?
[4:56:40] <+Irridium> cooling system is dumb. really wish it wasn't there
[4:56:41] <DatAsuna> If billy wasn't here I bet this puzze would take wwaaay longer
[4:56:42] <DestroPrime83> like its using Nvidia CPUs to power your jetpacks
[4:56:42] <$RilsRislan> err player maerker
[4:56:42] <waifoong98> @BaronVonDickButt it is a braindead version of Armored Core heat system
[4:56:48] <+mechslayer71> @baronvondickbutt On the surface, yeah, but there are tricks to get around it
[4:56:49] <+thecosmicfly> I like the meta mechanic of this game where overheating your javelin will also overheat your console and cause it to shut down. It's a brave design chouce
[4:56:50] <+Grayhammatter> game looks kinda mediocre at best
[4:56:50] <+gantz_zero> @Irridium just upgrade your shit
[4:56:56] <@mothmandraws> imagine a tank that can only be used near lakes and waterfalls
[4:56:58] <HitchhikingThrough> Ghost of Dead Space is that you
[4:56:59] <+MagicBeanBurrito> wtf
[4:56:59] <@mothmandraws> its wierd
[4:57:00] <releasethehounds0> You know what game doesn't limit your movement? Superman 64
[4:57:04] <Skatedeandre> i dont mind the system for hovering but full flying is dumb
[4:57:09] <+InhumanMilitia> double jump 'clank!'
[4:57:14] <@mothmandraws> overheating would be fine just for dashes
[4:57:15] <MyNameIsRasus> It's the Byakugan from the Broken Bond
[4:57:19] <@mothmandraws> and pushing the system further
[4:57:19] <eyedol33> @DatAsuna Theres stuff to equip to make it take way longer.
[4:57:21] <$RilsRislan> "Who's talking"
[4:57:27] <The_Blumper> straight outta Toy Story
[4:57:29] <@mothmandraws> but flying should be just a general system and not overheat you
[4:57:29] <+SuichiTanaka> Welcome to MMOs. The sea of Black and Red color schemes
[4:57:31] <+LogothX> woolies guy looks like a scuffed action figure
[4:57:32] <+VektorTroika> You know what's really great? Desaturated colors. Everywhere
[4:57:32] <Parapattern> It's becuz they're not weebs Woolie
[4:57:36] <+Lixagon> woolies colors look like cheap plasitc LUL
[4:57:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Woolie actually looks stylish
[4:57:38] <$RilsRislan> now leave
[4:57:38] <waifoong98> @SuichiTanaka too true LUL
[4:57:42] <DestroPrime83> Anthems jets are powered by CPU drives
[4:57:44] <$RilsRislan> the go kill 3 camps
[4:57:45] <HitchhikingThrough> I...mm that dialogue doesn't feel quite right
[4:57:47] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie looks like a Gigas right now
[4:57:48] <Shisno27> @releasethehounds0 damn, when is woolie going to play a REAL movement-based game?
[4:57:49] <$RilsRislan> and defend 3 objectives
[4:57:50] <+gael_j> Woah an in world textbox
[4:57:50] <eyedol33> lol billy
[4:57:50] <Goraka91> MORE LOADING?
[4:57:50] <VirtuaRailith> that seems awful
[4:57:51] <$RilsRislan> then come back

[4:58:07] <Louie_Salmon> @youwereeatenbyalid Just like Destiny dialogue
[4:58:10] <+Grayhammatter> l o a d i n g
[4:58:12] <Skatedeandre> theres a bunch
[4:58:12] <Dg10262> I hope you guys like loading screens
[4:58:12] <DestroPrime83> SO MANY LOAD DOORS!
[4:58:17] <+thecosmicfly> Needs a Liset to jiggle around
[4:58:19] <+flclmaster777> this doesnt look great
[4:58:23] <+TeethMuncher> @arkv01 zoids?
[4:58:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> LOADING IN THE MIDDLE OF MISSIONS??
[4:58:27] <Parapattern> The Disappointment is setting IN
[4:58:31] <@mothmandraws> loading screens are the random battles of anthem
[4:58:35] <Adriangabs> Warframe is a sea of eye vomit when it comes to color, I know because that's how I color my frames LUL
[4:58:35] <Estuko> Eyy MinhTgreen!
[4:58:36] <arkv01> @TeethMuncher there's an open world zoids game?
[4:58:41] <Parapattern> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[4:58:44] <+krispen_wa> this game doesn't even have peter dinklage getting surprised about people from the moon
[4:58:45] <releasethehounds0> This isn't sonic unleashed
[4:58:46] <waifoong98> I would rather have worse grafix than constant loading DansGame
[4:58:48] <HitchhikingThrough> @Louie_Salmon I guess it's still better than OP dialogue in warframe
[4:58:50] <+TeethMuncher> @arkv01 no, but there should be
[4:58:52] <+Kilik_> @WoolieVersus get used to the loading screen....
[4:58:57] <$RilsRislan> Just spam abilities til everything is dead
[4:58:59] <Valdorick> No no, load screens are the boss where you have to lose of anthem. Because really now...
[4:58:59] <Skatedeandre> it tells you when you can use
[4:59:03] <Goraka91> Peter Dinklage was patched out. It's Nolan North now
[4:59:09] <Goraka91> I think
[4:59:15] <%GarbageNirvana> I do hope they do more to integrate the flight with the combat
[4:59:23] <Skatedeandre> man that was the craziest shit ever @Goraka91
[4:59:33] <dekkitout> dinklage was back in the first game, im surprised people still remember that
[4:59:35] <HitchhikingThrough> Jesus your character is just called the freelancer?
[4:59:36] <Reanimator83> The Colors on your suit are burning my retinas LUL
[4:59:37] <+TheMorilo> Can you imagine if Nolan North is playing Tyrion on the last season of Game of Thrones
[4:59:41] <IndoorSitup> This whole game could be described with one word: Soulless.
[4:59:41] <+krispen_wa> imagine paying thousands upon thousands for peter dinklage only to patch him out
[4:59:42] <@mothmandraws> behind any rock could be a new loading screen hiding
[4:59:46] <loudspeaka> this looks the big garbage
[4:59:50] <+VektorTroika> nobody can forget Dinklage
[4:59:50] <@mothmandraws> loading ambush
[4:59:51] <releasethehounds0> I figured out what the "Anthem" is. It's Shaggy. It just UI Shaggy.
[4:59:51] <%quackisalive> I see Woolie also went for the EVA 01 colours XD
[4:59:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Can you hear the excitement in his voice? LUL LUL LUL
[5:00:08] <Estuko> Are we going to get the Loading Screen everywhere system?
[5:00:13] <+Lixagon> the UI is just super ugly isnt it?
[5:00:13] <objurgo> how does Woolie have EVA colours in this?
[5:00:15] <%alrobot2014> where the fuck is the objective marker
[5:00:19] <Adriangabs> Ooooohhhh Underwater *bumps*
[5:00:21] <eyedol33> Bill left him again lol
[5:00:22] <+thecosmicfly> What gets me about the killing off Cayde-6 at the start of Forsaken is that they couldn't even get Nathan Fillion back to play him
[5:00:24] <HitchhikingThrough> Well, that's something warframe doesn't have
[5:00:28] <DestroPrime83> I bet $2000 anthem makes less than 800,000 sales in its first week
[5:00:32] <dekkitout> yet-
[5:00:33] <HitchhikingThrough> wait no it does, it just sucks and isn't on the open map
[5:00:36] <TigerClaws12> yikes the motion blur
[5:00:44] <Puhff> god if i get one more dubstep ad...
[5:00:48] <Louie_Salmon> @youwereeatenbyalid To be fair, when the suits are called lancers, freelancer is actually pretty cool
[5:00:51] <%maskedriderhero> The sounds keep cutting out
[5:00:52] <+Kilik_> you can turn it off Tiger
[5:00:55] <Estuko> @puhff I just went through it, it felt like ages.
[5:00:59] <Skatedeandre> yeah motion blur :/
[5:01:00] <+LogothX> who's excited for the new Titanfall
[5:01:00] <+krispen_wa> being a lancer is suffering. Which is this game
[5:01:02] <Goraka91> Freelancer sounds too much like Pathfinder tbh
[5:01:03] <releasethehounds0> Warframe underwater was so cool for 0.00008 microseconds
[5:01:12] <waifoong98> @releasethehounds0 fuck sharkwing
[5:01:13] <Skatedeandre> dark zone
[5:01:13] <HitchhikingThrough> @Louie_Salmon I thought they were called Javalines?
[5:01:14] <IndoorSitup> This game is suffering.
[5:01:20] <EASrake> you die in real life
[5:01:23] <+gantz_zero> same for in space @releasethehounds0
[5:01:24] <+Lutherian90> Who is woolie playing with?
[5:01:24] <Valdorick> They're playing follow the ProTag, and Woolie is winning.
[5:01:35] <@mothmandraws> I wish you couold do strafing runs with your gun
[5:01:35] <thesecter28141> you should do a stronghold on hard difficulty
[5:01:36] <+Kilik_> @Youwereeatenbyalid Freelancers pilots Javelins
[5:01:36] <+Grayhammatter> when you die in the game, you die for real
[5:01:37] <Estuko> @Lutherian90 Billy
[5:01:37] <+krispen_wa> he's playing with Billy
[5:01:38] <@mothmandraws> and didnt have to slow down
[5:01:39] <+Lixagon> woolie cant aim for shit LUL
[5:01:41] <Skatedeandre> @Lutherian90 billy/minh
[5:01:42] <%alrobot2014> wouldn't you follow Unit 01
[5:01:46] <Louie_Salmon> @youwereeatenbyalid Oh, right. Well, that's sorta like a lance, I guess? Eh.
[5:01:55] <Parapattern> If you die here, EA sends a hitman to your house to kill you
[5:01:56] <MyNameIsRasus> What does this game have against the concept of fun
[5:02:07] <DestroPrime83> my favorite game to play is a game with only 2 types of content, explore and fight
[5:02:09] <extradopeness> What it do
[5:02:09] <+Kilik_> Money
[5:02:09] <+krispen_wa> When can Woolie combine with Minh to create a giant mecha?
[5:02:09] <JooseNeck> The midair aiming looks wonky
[5:02:10] <Valdorick> Doesn't Unit 01 go batshit crazy and eat a bunch of mechs a few times? I wouldn't follow that in my life.
[5:02:10] <HitchhikingThrough> @Louie_Salmon Imma be real with you, I'm not feeling it
[5:02:14] <+TheMorilo> This game is super clean, but it's also a mess (?)
[5:02:28] <IndoorSitup> Believe me Woolz, the lag isn't because of the stream. It's happening to fucking everyone.
[5:02:29] <@mothmandraws> so many visual effects
[5:02:30] <dekkitout> unit 1 only ate 1.5 mechs tajC
[5:02:32] <@mothmandraws> its like an MMO
[5:02:35] <+Kilik_> if they get rid of the bugs a
[5:02:36] <+Lixagon> is the audio shitting itself ir is that just the game?
[5:02:37] <HitchhikingThrough> A VOID FISSURE
[5:02:38] <torontototoro> tbh this game is pretty boring to watch. doesn't look like anything has impact
[5:02:39] <@mothmandraws> but you have to move in it
[5:02:39] <Estuko> I can't recall the game, but when flying I liked that in that game you're ragdolled if knocked out of the air but can recover with a button press with some stamina
[5:02:40] <Skatedeandre> thats a spawner
[5:02:44] <HitchhikingThrough> QUICK, DO YOU HAVE A MATCHING RELIC
[5:02:45] <Goraka91> I would say why are they called Javelins but Spartans wear Mjolnir so whatever
[5:02:48] <torontototoro> just a bunch of flashing lights and pew pews
[5:02:49] <TigerClaws12> it's a mess when it comes to clarity whenever shit goes down, basically watching a fireworks from 5ft away LUL
[5:02:59] <ToxInjection> The DF video for the demo puts it perfectly - you can't have these unstable framerates in a shooter. Shooters require active feedback and consistency to be enjoyable. Anthem's got work to do.
[5:03:00] <Dg10262> I can’t tell what’s happening with all the crap on the screen
[5:03:00] <UnfilteredComic> @TheMorilo Visuals Good, Gameplay good, everything else so far, a mess
[5:03:03] <+gael_j> This is kinda disorienting
[5:03:03] <+VektorTroika> YEAH, JERRA'S WRATH
[5:03:07] <+Lixagon> game sounds like its crashing LUL
[5:03:08] <releasethehounds0> Javelins are huge racists against the color purple ok chat see now you made it akward
[5:03:09] <+SuichiTanaka> I still dunno what the humanoid enemies look like
[5:03:10] <%maskedriderhero> Does anyone else notice the sounds keep cutting out?
[5:03:11] <+VietcongSamurai> I also feel like the audio is sorta cutting in and out in game.
[5:03:12] <@mothmandraws> woolie how is sound on your end, your voice is fine but game sounds wierd when in fire fights
[5:03:14] <IndoorSitup> DAT AUDIO THO
[5:03:15] <JooseNeck> Does this game have any melee options?
[5:03:16] <Adriangabs> if something explodes right next to you, you won't see shit
[5:03:23] <+SuichiTanaka> There are so few unique shapes in this game's design
[5:03:25] <+gantz_zero> @TigerClaws12 people say the same thing about sports they've never played
[5:03:26] <extradopeness> Ohhh this one of them GAME games
[5:03:33] <Skatedeandre> theres just a gun butt
[5:03:34] <releasethehounds0> yeah
[5:03:37] <releasethehounds0> exactly
[5:03:37] <+Kilik_> if they get rid of the bugs (and loading screens) I can see this game being fun, IF there is shit to actually do, which atm doesn't seem so
[5:03:38] <Adriangabs> @JooseNeck it has the standard melee swipe
[5:03:38] <Skatedeandre> for melee
[5:03:42] <+VektorTroika> wifi's back
[5:03:44] <Goraka91> @SuichiTanaka Oh that's what was bothering me
[5:03:50] <dekkitout> im not sure if i can guarantee if this game wont also have bobby pin bugs at this point
[5:03:53] <releasethehounds0> one of them VIDEO Gamer contraptions
[5:03:54] <%QueequegTheater> Ace Combat 7 looks weird
[5:03:55] <DestroPrime83> Anthems lack of content got me like ResidentSleeper
[5:03:55] <Louie_Salmon> Is there music? I feel like music would help
[5:04:01] <+earthboy2k> this good or nah?
[5:04:02] <Skatedeandre> those diamonds are gear
[5:04:07] <MyNameIsRasus> nah
[5:04:08] <+krispen_wa> imagine playing anthem
[5:04:09] <@mothmandraws> ye I just noticed very little music
[5:04:09] <+SuichiTanaka> It's a very 5/10
[5:04:10] <@mothmandraws> its wierd
[5:04:12] <%riscuit> this game looks like all flash no substance tbh
[5:04:12] <ToxInjection> @jooseneck The Javelin Interceptor is basically a ninja
[5:04:14] <eyedol33> @JooseNeck Yeah the interceptor still gets gets guns and ranged attacks but is much more movement and melee focused.
[5:04:19] <+krispen_wa> but there's not even flash
[5:04:19] <+VektorTroika> You know what's really cool and creative and not at all tiring to listen to? Stuffy faux British accents
[5:04:19] <@mothmandraws> no music and the odd sound things is odd
[5:04:25] <+Grayhammatter> like interception
[5:04:26] <+mechslayer71> @baronvondickbutt Yeah, I had fun with the demo, but it’s giving me the same feeling the Destiny 1 betas did LUL
[5:04:33] <+TeethMuncher> @Louie_Salmon that's it! That's what bothered!
[5:04:34] <+TheMorilo> There's technically music. I know because they played it on the Game Awards
[5:04:34] <Parapattern> Yeah, why is there no background music?
[5:04:40] <+MagicBeanBurrito> wow this seems bland
[5:04:40] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus Those diamonds are items. You need to pick them up or you wont get them
[5:04:42] <extradopeness> Imagine dragons deez ugh nvm
[5:04:44] <+Noxyba> is this Xbone or is Woolie just using a controller
[5:04:47] <releasethehounds0> I'm playing yhe warframe ost in the backround and that elevates it to a 5.1/10
[5:04:48] <Goraka91> Space British were cool back in Star Wars. 30 years ago.
[5:04:50] <waifoong98> @Parapattern "ImMeRsIoN" Kappa
[5:04:52] <sileo_patronus> It may just be these specific weapons but the sound design feels a tad flaccid
[5:04:55] <Skatedeandre> ps4 i believe
[5:04:59] <+zestyArsenic> melee seems very weak. i take it there is no melee javalin either?
[5:05:00] <DestroPrime83> @mechslayer71 wheres the god damn poker table? or my fishing holes?
[5:05:03] <Estuko> @Goraka91 those imperial officer suits were snazzy
[5:05:03] <malletman241> good colour scheme woolie
[5:05:04] <+Noxyba> Oh yeah I guess it would be
[5:05:04] <+gantz_zero> @Noxybaru neither, ps4
[5:05:05] <Finakala> Yeah this gun sounds like shit
[5:05:06] <+Proxzo> lookit woolie in his eva ass eva
[5:05:07] <Skatedeandre> @TendrilsTwitch no
[5:05:12] <JooseNeck> The gunplay looks kinda bland and boring
[5:05:14] <Valdorick> What was that one really dope looking third person, hero based, objective focused game that bombed a while back... FireFall? This feels like Firefall.
[5:05:16] <Goraka91> @Estuko More like Hugo Boss Kreygasm
[5:05:19] <+earthboy2k> this reminds me of the division
[5:05:23] <+VektorTroika> Space British were also super evil back then
[5:05:30] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus You arent picking up any items
[5:05:34] <+krispen_wa> this is the game that will kill bioware
[5:05:35] <IndoorSitup> Flying really does get old after a while.
[5:05:37] <MyNameIsRasus> This is Division + Warframe
[5:05:38] <keiji_maede> this man is going to get lost alot
[5:05:45] <+holidayMD> TendrilsTwitch the Interceptor
[5:05:45] <keiji_maede> and enjoy it! xD
[5:05:47] <+Lightburst> The guns don't look powerful at all bullet wise is this just me?
[5:05:48] <+mechslayer71> @jooseneck Yeah, compared to the abilities for sure
[5:05:48] <Dg10262> He’s flying like he’s wearing Mario’s cape
[5:05:50] <gustavozxd> I tuned in and thought this was that Terry Crews game
[5:05:51] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I see a lot of andromeda in this
[5:05:59] <+VektorTroika> Under the new emblem of the Double Cross, liberty was banished, free speech was suppressed, and only the voice of Hinkle was heard
[5:06:01] <Goraka91> Crackdown 3?
[5:06:04] <+thecosmicfly> The dive to reduce overheat mechanic does a very good job to simulate drunk Tony Stark
[5:06:09] <gustavozxd> yeah that one
[5:06:10] <@mothmandraws> woolie does billy know if this game has music
[5:06:12] <+gantz_zero> they meant loot, not environment stuff @WoolieVersus
[5:06:12] <Adriangabs> This is basically Mass Effect MMO really
[5:06:12] <releasethehounds0> This is warframe's weird cousin thst just doesn't get what cool is
[5:06:13] <@mothmandraws> its really wierd
[5:06:15] <Estuko> @Goraka91 Lol
[5:06:18] <extradopeness> Minh actually sounds like a robot
[5:06:20] <+TeethMuncher> @Goraka91 dpm
[5:06:20] <+MagicBeanBurrito> movement seems real jerky
[5:06:22] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah Woolie, stop flying and look at the floor to grab slightly different guns
[5:06:43] <IndoorSitup> This game will be the death knell of Bioware. It is such a bland ball of nothing.
[5:06:44] <@mothmandraws> maybe they dont have it so you can play your dubsteps
[5:06:48] <+TeethMuncher> @Goraka91 don't say it out loud, you'll scare it away
[5:06:50] <%Menitta> Aight I'm tapping out. Later Woolz and chat!
[5:06:51] <+VektorTroika> @releasethehounds0 Yeah! Kids love the calladooty mcironmans!
[5:06:52] <ToxInjection> C R A F T I N G
[5:06:53] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus Im talking about the litteral item drops like guns
[5:06:55] <@mothmandraws> I like the enviroments
[5:06:57] <%Menitta> and Iinh
[5:07:00] <gustavozxd> god woolie these colors LUL
[5:07:02] <Skatedeandre> @WoolieVersus they appear as diamonds on the screen
[5:07:03] <%Menitta> Minh*
[5:07:03] <MyNameIsRasus> wub wub motherfuckers
[5:07:04] <@mothmandraws> just wish there was more happening
[5:07:04] <Spacetrucker138> when did they add jet packs in warframe?
[5:07:05] <Estuko> @MagickBurritoh the movement feels like when he's running it's trying to stick him to align with the surface of the ground
[5:07:08] <eyedol33> @WoolieVersus You get pretty decent movement if you space your double jumps while sprinting.
[5:07:10] <+mechslayer71> Flying low to the water keeps you cool @woolieversus
[5:07:11] <extradopeness> @SoushinSen love u bby
[5:07:11] <Goraka91> @TeethMuncher Like it's ever coming out LUL
[5:07:13] <Skatedeandre> there is gear
[5:07:16] <EASrake> There will be WAYPOINTS for the important items
[5:07:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The movements are sudden, it's like there's no acceleration and when you fly you achieve top speed instantly
[5:07:23] <+VektorTroika> @jubeibob when the archwing update dropped
[5:07:24] <+zestyArsenic> i like how you have this infinite grenade spawning mech thing, but the shittiest looking gun in the world
[5:07:31] <+Kilik_> honestly after playing the demo for several hours, I feel this game will have a lot of wasted potential, hope to be proved wrong
[5:07:39] <Spacetrucker138> ok gottcha
[5:07:42] <gustavozxd> wait crackdown 3 is not out yet?
[5:07:45] <Skatedeandre> yeah the guns look lame af
[5:07:49] <%GarbageNirvana> Hopefully guns get more interesting
[5:07:52] <%QueequegTheater> Hey look it's like if archwing missions didn't suck a fat dick
[5:07:57] <+TeethMuncher> Where are the two randos?
[5:08:07] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Has anyone here played Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet?
[5:08:08] <%GarbageNirvana> That's one thing I like about Warframe, some of the guns in that game are bonkers
[5:08:09] <Dg10262> I smell a loading screen coming
[5:08:10] <dekkitout> crackdown 3 comes out feb 30, if memory serves best Kappa
[5:08:17] <gustavozxd> hmm this smells like a bullet sponge idk
[5:08:21] <releasethehounds0> Rumour has it nobody has ever finished an archwing pursuit mission
[5:08:25] <Estuko> As much as there's stuff going on, I'm not feeling any umf from the game
[5:08:26] <+trav2_> ResidentSleeper
[5:08:31] <Skatedeandre> yeah enimes are a little bullet spongey
[5:08:31] <ToxInjection> @kilik_ exactly my thoughts. There's a chance at scrounging something great from this if it doesn't fuck itself.
[5:08:33] <Estuko> @releasethehounds0 FeelsBadMan
[5:08:39] <+mechslayer71> @gustavozxd Oh it definitely is LUL
[5:08:40] <vriskybusiness8> Min??
[5:08:40] <+Irridium> I'm not ever gonna get Dark Void 2010's jetpack in an actual good game am I. I was hoping this game could be that but... eh
[5:08:41] <DestroPrime83> @TeethMuncher aperently they fucked off somewhere else?
[5:08:42] <+Kilik_> @gustavozxd more like reeks of spone
[5:08:43] <Adriangabs> @GarbageNirvana Arca Plasmor is my favorite
[5:08:44] <Louie_Salmon> Honestly the most glaring issue to me is the lack of music, that would do so much for the atmosphere
[5:08:44] <+gantz_zero> @gustavozxd so you'd rather enemies just die realistically to one bullet
[5:08:46] <+TeethMuncher> @releasethehounds0 not a rumor, it's fact
[5:08:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Why is it that the best weapons are lame? Guns are so fucking boring
[5:08:52] <Estuko> @hydroarsonist69 MinhTgreenT = Billy
[5:08:55] <+MagicBeanBurrito> healing lightning
[5:09:02] <Goraka91> It's Lost Planet 2 with floating instead of a grappling hook
[5:09:04] <Valdorick> ProTag Hero mech revives his nakama.
[5:09:10] <JooseNeck> I haven't seen the interceptor, but that almost sounds like the best way to enjoy this game... the guns just seem so damn boring
[5:09:12] <Estuko> @MyNameIsRasus gimme those fists/pile bunkers
[5:09:13] <+Grayhammatter> he did not see it
[5:09:21] <%QueequegTheater> Is this Metal Gear Solid
[5:09:23] <MyNameIsRasus> YEYEYEYE
[5:09:23] <+Axellogic> That green diamond is loot woolie
[5:09:24] <$KnivesEve> are there flamethrowers or plamsa rifles?
[5:09:26] <gustavozxd> @gantz_zero neither of the two exaggerations are a good option
[5:09:27] <Estuko> @Goraka91 I still play it time to time, I love the game LUL
[5:09:31] <@mothmandraws> I wonder how fast things die when geared but on hard mode with the like 3000x multiplier
[5:09:34] <Shisno27> the warlock is the best class because you don't use your gun, you just cast magic
[5:09:36] <+Axellogic> Diamonds are loot
[5:09:37] <EASrake> That green diamond is an uncommon drop
[5:09:39] <@mothmandraws> does loot scale well enoguh with it
[5:09:41] <TheDr0t> hello there
[5:09:41] <releasethehounds0> Metal Gear Survive in Space
[5:09:46] <+MagicBeanBurrito> oh, loot is highlighted through geometry that's nice
[5:09:46] <Dg10262> I legit can’t tell what’s going on
[5:09:47] <%GarbageNirvana> @Ariksgabs Dassa good one too
[5:09:49] <vriskybusiness8> @Estuko yeah i heard his voice and thought it was, thx 4 confirmation
[5:09:54] <+gantz_zero> big diamond is loot @WoolieVersus
[5:09:57] <IIChampagne> has the Madden gone sicko mode?
[5:09:57] <DestroPrime83> Is that the ZAPPING SYSTEM?
[5:10:01] <Goraka91> @Estuko Don't have a console no more but yeah was fun SeemsGood
[5:10:05] <Adriangabs> @GarbageNirvana yeah, it's basically Doom's BFG LUL
[5:10:17] <Estuko> @Goraka91 I bought it like 3 different times lol, ps3, xbox 360, then steam.
[5:10:18] <gustavozxd> I played vanquish on hard and even though enemies had more health than normal, they never felt like bullet sponges
[5:10:27] <DestroPrime83> Wait! where the fuck did these 2 chuckle fucks come from?
[5:10:29] <IndoorSitup> Word of advice for anyone playing: do NOT pick the Colussus for your second Javelin, it is so fucking boring.
[5:10:41] <@mothmandraws> I think gusta the reason for that
[5:10:47] <@mothmandraws> is that in vanquish you have to keep moving
[5:10:47] <+krispen_wa> !SOUND AT RISK!
[5:10:47] <%alrobot2014> people can join missions in the middle of the mission
[5:10:49] <+Lixagon> LUL
[5:10:50] <+MagicBeanBurrito> POP
[5:10:50] <+Lixagon> TV
[5:10:52] <%Chichen> thats your tv
[5:10:53] <+NiktenKing> TV
[5:10:53] <@mothmandraws> and have stuff you need to keep doing
[5:10:54] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The movements of andromeda and now this is what I can only describe as a bird flying inside a cage
[5:10:54] <+Grayhammatter> TV
[5:10:55] <%GarbageNirvana> @Ariksgabs I've found I enjoy the Phantasma, just pull the trigger and watch high level shit melt in front of you
[5:10:56] <Estuko> monkaS
[5:10:58] <+gantz_zero> your tv @WoolieVersus
[5:10:59] <Ropcord> monkaS
[5:10:59] <+gael_j> IS that a portal to the shadow realm
[5:10:59] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[5:10:59] <gustavozxd> there's a line between having enough health/too much health, honestly it's difficult to tell
[5:10:59] <+Axellogic> Colossus is fine but you need good ordinance drops
[5:11:00] <Skatedeandre> it was the tv
[5:11:01] <Goraka91> BLACKOUT monkaS
[5:11:02] <MyNameIsRasus> %V
[5:11:03] <+mechslayer71> Tv
[5:11:03] <extradopeness> This is weird man
[5:11:05] <+Kilik_> tbh, I think the assault rifle he is using is a really boring gun. full auto ones just feel bland in this game (except auto cannons). single shot ones feel better imo
[5:11:05] <%alrobot2014> what the fuck is that sound
[5:11:05] <EASrake> nothing on the stream
[5:11:06] <+trav2_> monkaS
[5:11:07] <+MagicBeanBurrito> lovely
[5:11:07] <UnfilteredComic> Audio glitches are really common, it was your TV btw @WoolieVersus
[5:11:10] <sileo_patronus> more than anything this game seems slower than I expected
[5:11:12] <Valdorick> TV's video card is dying! /s
[5:11:12] <@mothmandraws> your screen is now the loading screen
[5:11:14] <xeros720> given how long woolie streamed, his tv probably just went to sleep
[5:11:17] <releasethehounds0> If you can't even name your javies "Gustav" fuck this game
[5:11:23] <Estuko> The loading screen will invade your life
[5:11:24] <+TeethMuncher> I wish the effects were toned down a bit, my eyes are starting to ache
[5:11:26] <+VektorTroika> time to buy a 2.1 hdmi cable kappa
[5:11:27] <MyNameIsRasus> It was Satan!
[5:11:29] <Ropcord> it's the ghost from the shitstorm monkaS
[5:11:30] <Skatedeandre> you can name loadouts
[5:11:30] <dekkitout> not only does anthem destroy hard drives, it also destroys tv's monkaS
[5:11:33] <Adriangabs> @GarbageNirvana I haven't modded that one properly yet, but yeah that's also a very good one
[5:11:35] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Roll, Link
[5:11:36] <UnfilteredComic> @mothmandraws Loading screen virus infecting your tv
[5:11:41] <Skatedeandre> but not the javelin itself i think
[5:11:43] <+mechslayer71> Flowing over water keeps you cool @woolieversus
[5:11:47] <MarcusComedy> What's up Woolie!!!
[5:11:49] <%QueequegTheater> cheer500 Finally caught up on the podcast. WOolie, if you think Ace Combat 7's "You killed the President" is wild, it has NOTHING on Ace Combat 5, where a bunch of assholes just show up and tell everyone you're a traitor, and everyone just believes them.
[5:12:06] <%Rezca> so fighting game tech in a shooter?
[5:12:07] <+NiktenKing> Sprint and dash into flight during Interceptor movement. It's pretty neat.
[5:12:27] <Goraka91> Spiderdemons monkaS
[5:12:38] <DestroPrime83> big 0 damage son
[5:12:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Lemme guess, gotta hit these ones from the back
[5:12:39] <Ropcord> D: PETA
[5:12:40] <Valdorick> Or THAT mission from Ace Combat 0... you know the one.
[5:12:47] <xeros720> GIVE US YOUR MEATS
[5:12:51] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Woolie "Let's fuck up these animals" Madden
[5:12:52] <+krispen_wa> You gotta hit the back
[5:12:52] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus You only dipped in briefly, do keep an eye out for circle bridge .etc to see some of the real deep dive spots. Some nice underwater glowies and stuff, very pretty
[5:12:54] <extradopeness> Ace Combat is a series i've always admired from afar.
[5:12:55] <@mothmandraws> did woolie work out how to read his bits
[5:12:56] <StarvingPenguinGod> this demos pretty fun CrreamAwk
[5:13:01] <FruitBasketVidya> ehh
[5:13:08] <+PatStaresAt> does he noit use stremlabz
[5:13:11] <MyNameIsRasus> ARRANGE THEM MEATIES SON
[5:13:11] <releasethehounds0> Respect mother nature by slaughtering hundreds of endangered species Woolie
[5:13:12] <dekkitout> quick use a flash pod
[5:13:12] <+Reizie_Etherealm> A game where freedom of movement is one of the focus like this, I feel like having 2 dodge buttons like Fatal Bullet would help a whole lot
[5:13:12] <HitchhikingThrough> @mothmandraws donate some bits and find out
[5:13:13] <Adriangabs> The good ol' "Make them charge at you and then shoot them at the back" mechanic
[5:13:15] <%QueequegTheater> @Valdorick I never played 0, unfortunately. Give me a mission title
[5:13:18] <@mothmandraws> he does but he had issues with it before
[5:13:19] <IndoorSitup> This game is ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[5:13:20] <Shisno27> "did woolie work out how to read" no.
[5:13:25] <@mothmandraws> couldnt find the tab
[5:13:25] <extradopeness> I think zero was the only one i played
[5:13:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Hello darkness
[5:13:29] <+krispen_wa> All things begin in loading, and all so end
[5:13:32] <WOAHGHOST> Who tryna run on ps4
[5:13:33] <+PatStaresAt> its in recent events o_o
[5:13:35] <@mothmandraws> he may have worked it out since last stream
[5:13:36] <+krispen_wa> this game is no different
[5:13:37] <%QueequegTheater> PAT
[5:13:46] <+krispen_wa> loading sprouts within it, it grows, consumes it.
[5:13:46] <+Kilik_> @dekkitout you mean load a better game Kappa
[5:13:49] <extradopeness> Yo Pat!
[5:13:53] <HitchhikingThrough> Wha Happun Pat
[5:13:54] <%alrobot2014> the lack of music in this game really brings it down
[5:13:54] <HitchhikingThrough> ?
[5:14:02] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus just generally yeah there's a lot of bridges with that design and they tend to go over deep water
[5:14:02] <%QueequegTheater> I didn't know you could reach up to a laptop keyboard :)
[5:14:07] <+krispen_wa> in the end, all things return to the load screen which they came
[5:14:07] <xeros720> maybe it has some kickin boss themes
[5:14:07] <@mothmandraws> I agree bot, its bizare having no BGM
[5:14:14] <Valdorick> Mission 12 @QueequegTheater
[5:14:15] <%Chichen> apatHoldon apatWhat apatDab
[5:14:16] <xeros720> maybe it has a boss?
[5:14:18] <@mothmandraws> it makes it feel really empty
[5:14:19] <%alrobot2014> i hope it has something
[5:14:23] <JooseNeck> How is Pat not a mod? cmonBruh
[5:14:30] <DestroPrime83> @AngriestPat so what do you think of this game so far? payed it or just watching Woolie?
[5:14:31] <+krispen_wa> How is Pat?
[5:14:32] <dekkitout> the bottle of anti freeze across the room is looking more appealing than this game, maybe i'll go but fo76 to feel something
[5:14:37] <gustavozxd> muh immersion tho
[5:14:37] <HitchhikingThrough> @JooseNeck we can't give him that kind of power
[5:14:40] <releasethehounds0> Look at this game. It comes to this TPS genre, when it knows it is not pure.
[5:14:42] <+TeethMuncher> @JooseNeck he came up short in the lottery
[5:14:50] <Goraka91> The music isn't even bad, it seems ideal for background stuff
[5:14:55] <@mothmandraws> what usic
[5:14:58] <@mothmandraws> music
[5:15:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Come on chat, it's not a soundtrack could improve the ambiance of a game Kappa
[5:15:02] <%QueequegTheater> Oh fuck THAT one
[5:15:03] <Skatedeandre> there barely is music
[5:15:03] <releasethehounds0> what music
[5:15:04] <ransack426> lol
[5:15:05] <Reanimator83> I would turn the music off in destiny so this not having music isn’t really an issue for me.
[5:15:08] <+Kilik_> only strongholds have bosses in that sense I think, and the game will only launch with 3 of them
[5:15:10] <HitchhikingThrough> BUT ENOUGH ABOUT PLOT
[5:15:10] <+trav2_> wat moosic
[5:15:14] <+gael_j> what is music
[5:15:16] <Goraka91> The main menu music clearly
[5:15:24] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Why is there no fkin music?
[5:15:27] <Skatedeandre> destiny raid puzzles
[5:15:28] <@mothmandraws> tfw the loading screens get music but the fights dont
[5:15:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Realistic immersion!!
[5:15:35] <+TheMorilo> Hey look, it's the iconic Anthem level "ancient ruins"!
[5:15:37] <@mothmandraws> true focus of the gameplay
[5:15:37] <xeros720> sounds like it's gonna have a real lack of content issue like destiny
[5:15:38] <MyNameIsRasus> music machine broke
[5:15:38] <michaelthehobbit> my game bugged and i couldnt complete this
[5:15:39] <FruitopiaFred> I can hear music but its really quiet
[5:15:40] <gustavozxd> @mynameisrasus makes me think about how xenoblade games would feel without those region themes NotLikeThis
[5:15:42] <+VektorTroika> Javelins use the keys, but they are mere trespassers
[5:15:42] <IndoorSitup> PUZZLE TIME
[5:15:43] <+digital_pinp> Are there moon wizards in this game?
[5:15:47] <releasethehounds0> OH BOI
[5:15:50] <EASrake> This game really suffers from not having a text chat
[5:15:52] <releasethehounds0> p u z z l e s
[5:15:53] <sileo_patronus> Oh boy miltiplayer puzzles with randoms
[5:15:54] <+krispen_wa> maybe the music shows up when he gets more stylish points
[5:15:57] <%QueequegTheater> Hot take: Cipher is the most skilled Ace Combat player character but the Razgriz would shit all over any other AC squadron
[5:16:01] <Goraka91> Time to play the ANTHEM PogChamp
[5:16:06] <Xaxas115> can you gain powers in this game by shouting "its a Gundam!?"
[5:16:08] <StarvingPenguinGod> not the same color
[5:16:10] <Estuko> "Get the right colour" I'm colour blind FeelsBadMan SoSnowy
[5:16:12] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus not all samecolour
[5:16:14] <+queaks> Theres a hint near by each
[5:16:15] <Shisno27> find the glowy symbol in the environment and match it
[5:16:16] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus look at the walls
[5:16:17] <+Mvrdok_> In a hypothetical chronological order it would be: Titanfall - Anthem - Destiny - Warframe ? Jebaited
[5:16:19] <+Axellogic> The colors are on the wall
[5:16:21] <+gantz_zero> there's a light near every big one that you need to change it to @WoolieVersus
[5:16:22] <+mechslayer71> I did this shit by accident LUL
[5:16:23] <MyNameIsRasus> YEYEYE SEPARATE BY COLOR
[5:16:24] <+B0BZ1LLA> red purple and yellow
[5:16:25] <SGrim> No the same color, and the solution is NOT obvious
[5:16:26] <+trav2_> LUL
[5:16:26] <Dg10262> Good luck doing puzzles with randoms
[5:16:28] <@mothmandraws> it is kind of wierd game called anthem and music is barely there
[5:16:31] <xeros720> damn shitty colorbline options
[5:16:32] <gustavozxd> can you at least get cool armor in this game?
[5:16:33] <Goraka91> Oh no
[5:16:34] <+Kilik_> looks around the environment for colours near the portals
[5:16:36] <%QueequegTheater> "The solution violated my fashion souls"
[5:16:38] <%alrobot2014> oh that's why minh's stream was in purple
[5:16:39] <zamzoph> IT'S BLUE
[5:16:40] <+gantz_zero> only this one red @WoolieVersus
[5:16:40] <Shisno27> find the glowing symbol in the environment and match it please
[5:16:42] <dekkitout> thats green
[5:16:44] <Estuko> @Xaxas115 you gain about 5 extra allies or 5 extra enemies, if anything. Sieg Zeon
[5:16:46] <releasethehounds0> You solve this puzzle by sticking a recorder up your bum and playing smoke on the water. That is the "Anthem"
[5:16:46] <+Reveresao> each is their own color
[5:16:49] <%QueequegTheater> WHOOPS
[5:16:52] <+Irridium> done this twice and both times I got it on accident
[5:16:53] <+paladinstarbuster> LUL
[5:16:56] <eyedol33> @WoolieVersus Theres other hidden symbols
[5:16:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh my god
[5:16:57] <+NiktenKing> One of each color
[5:16:59] <+Grayhammatter> each platform has a different color minh and woolz
[5:17:02] <extradopeness> Whoa are we getting separate but equal in here
[5:17:06] <CrimsonCore90> So is this fun to play?
[5:17:08] <SGrim> @WoolieVersus they all have hidden symbols
[5:17:10] <+TeethMuncher> I can tell you first hand that I got stuck on this one last week, randos don't help
[5:17:10] <@mothmandraws> maybe the idea is you are supposed to sing songs with your friends and create the anthem
[5:17:11] <+NiktenKing> To match the enemies shields that were in the room before
[5:17:11] <Xaxas115> Estuko I have to do it to yah, Spacenoid scum!
[5:17:12] <camsmi7> There are sigils near each puzzle
[5:17:12] <+MagicBeanBurrito> I love when Woolie smacks into a wall
[5:17:14] <viciousgrim> match the color of the symbol
[5:17:14] <Adriangabs> when I played this mission I don't know how we managed to solve it
[5:17:15] <Shisno27> find the glowing symbols in proximity to each thing and match them
[5:17:17] <%QueequegTheater> @CrimsonCore90 Nobody knows
[5:17:19] <IndoorSitup> D E E P G A M E P L A Y
[5:17:20] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus The red one on the wall only applies to the one near it.
[5:17:20] <extradopeness> oof
[5:17:21] <xeros720> check your journal
[5:17:21] <MyNameIsRasus> The game is called fucking Anthem and there's barely music LUL
[5:17:24] <camsmi7> Match the color to the sigil
[5:17:28] <EASrake> each portal has their own glyph
[5:17:29] <+gantz_zero> YES @WoolieVersus
[5:17:33] <+gantz_zero> THANK GOD @WoolieVersus
[5:17:34] <camsmi7> look around to find the sigil
[5:17:36] <ransack426> oh so its rocket science
[5:17:43] <+gantz_zero> yes find the light @WoolieVersus
[5:17:44] <%Chichen> This seems terrible
[5:17:45] <%alrobot2014> every time i see this mission somebody else solves it
[5:17:45] <Estuko> @Xaxas115 LUL feddie?
[5:17:46] <Goraka91> @MyNameIsRasus Plenty of giant woofers though like wat
[5:17:46] <+queaks> @ one is purple and one is yellow
[5:17:46] <camsmi7> the purple one is under the bridge leading to it
[5:17:48] <dekkitout> this makes destiny puzzles look like plotting an orbital path
[5:17:51] <camsmi7> blue is up and to the left
[5:17:59] <Valdorick> Ah, ME:A style glyph puzzles... just what we always wanted.
[5:18:00] <gustavozxd> this reminds me of payday 2 and I've played that game waay too much, these objectives seem very eh
[5:18:00] <+gantz_zero> sometimes lights are under the bridge @WoolieVersus
[5:18:00] <releasethehounds0> It's not purple it's INDIGO
[5:18:03] <sileo_patronus> This isn't fun
[5:18:04] <%quackisalive> I was stuck on this puzzle for like 30mins
[5:18:04] <Shisno27> ITS SO EASY
[5:18:06] <DestroPrime83> ResidentSleeper
[5:18:10] <eyedol33> lol its really not
[5:18:11] <CrimsonCore90> Teno you are in the wrong game
[5:18:11] <%quackisalive> the solution is so sim[ple
[5:18:12] <+Grayhammatter> it'll be somewhere near it
[5:18:13] <+MagicBeanBurrito> P U Z Z L E
[5:18:14] <viciousgrim> one is under
[5:18:14] <Xaxas115> Estuko Nah AEUG
[5:18:16] <Skatedeandre> yeah i hated this shit in destiny too
[5:18:18] <ransack426> toasted mauve
[5:18:18] <%QueequegTheater> Cipher > Mobius One > Trigger > Blaze >>>>>>>>>>all other pilots
[5:18:18] <MyNameIsRasus> @goraka91 ?
[5:18:19] <Goraka91> Oh these puzzles were in MEA? Makes sense LUL
[5:18:20] <+queaks> @wollie purple red and yellow
[5:18:28] <+TheMorilo> What a thrill
[5:18:30] <DestroPrime83> My action game needs more PUZZLES!
[5:18:31] <HitchhikingThrough> Not going to lie, I think the Lua puzzles are slightly more engaging
[5:18:32] <+VektorTroika> seek the light WITHIN
[5:18:35] <Goraka91> @MyNameIsRasus Giant speakers
[5:18:36] <+gantz_zero> under the bridge @WoolieVersus
[5:18:36] <lordgrayknight> just change the color on the other two
[5:18:37] <IndoorSitup> THIS IS WHY I PLAY VIDEO GAMES
[5:18:37] <EASrake> ALMOST LOOKED AT IT
[5:18:37] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[5:18:38] <+Kilik_> under the bridge
[5:18:40] <eyedol33> @WoolieVersus Theres one underneath one of the bridges
[5:18:40] <%alrobot2014> The Darkness and silence throgh the night
[5:18:42] <MyNameIsRasus> OH GOTCHA
[5:18:43] <Shisno27> that's because you blind woolie
[5:18:43] <SGrim> @WoolieVersus you ignored an entire corner
[5:18:45] <+digital_pinp> This game shits on RE2 with it's superior puzzles.
[5:18:46] <dekkitout> these were in mass effect? aw lawd
[5:18:46] <camsmi7> go one level down and look up
[5:18:49] <extradopeness> This game's called Anthem and not one person has their damn hands up
[5:18:55] <%Rezca> Oh boy... not a very interesting puzzle
[5:18:59] <Estuko> @Xaxas115 oh well
[5:18:59] <ransack426> this seems prejudiced
[5:19:00] <sileo_patronus> Minigame puzzles I can handle, but full length room-scale puzzles? Nah
[5:19:01] <%Freelance7> So...just look around for the right color
[5:19:02] <+Lixagon> LUL
[5:19:07] <@mothmandraws> or 1 rando fucking it up
[5:19:09] <Skatedeandre> YEAH DESTINY
[5:19:10] <@mothmandraws> on purpose
[5:19:10] <Shisno27> SO HARRRD
[5:19:10] <Chocolate_Burrito> now just imagine that but destiny 2
[5:19:12] <+A0N33> Oh yeah, it was.
[5:19:12] <+Reveresao> last one is PURPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[5:19:12] <gustavozxd> car shop payday 2 anyone LUL
[5:19:13] <EASrake> There's also no text chat
[5:19:13] <+gantz_zero> this is the only bad puzzle in the demo @WoolieVersus
[5:19:16] <%alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus and randos can show up mid mission
[5:19:16] <Xaxas115> Estuko because we can both agree, Fuck the Titans
[5:19:17] <+krispen_wa> This game is less an Anthem and more a Funeral Dirge
[5:19:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie never seen q Destiny Raid huh
[5:19:19] <DietDrDoom> Totally
[5:19:19] <+Grayhammatter> that might be under
[5:19:22] <UnfilteredComic> This puzzle is so garbage, the area is way to large for a "find the tiny hidden detail" scenario
[5:19:24] <Estuko> @Xaxas115 doodBro
[5:19:24] <Adriangabs> This game is VERY Anti-Rando for a MMO
[5:19:25] <+A0N33> There's other puzzles in the demo?
[5:19:26] <ezl0ck> destiny raids are worse
[5:19:26] <+mechslayer71> We did it super by accident super fast LUL
[5:19:27] <camsmi7> lol it was fun with a party.. like herding cats
[5:19:31] <Valdorick> I was wrong. At least ME:A had you take out the scanner...
[5:19:32] <+NiktenKing> Just interact
[5:19:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Remember when Bungie had to unlock content for people because they put it behind a puzzle that their players couldn't figure out
[5:19:37] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus Last one is under the bridge
[5:19:38] <3Xgilly> process of elimination
[5:19:40] <EASrake> below the bridge
[5:19:40] <lordgrayknight> just change the color
[5:19:41] <BlacSoul> Hello all~
[5:19:42] <ransack426> need a box to herd cats
[5:19:44] <%QueequegTheater> Can't be a Destiny raid, not enough jumping pizzles where the walls have giant dicks shooting you into space
[5:19:46] <DestroPrime83> Slow ass non-specific puzzles in the middle of an action fighting game is GREAT
[5:19:48] <releasethehounds0> Look there's not toxicity because we just don't let them talk to eachother
[5:19:55] <DatAsuna> That's not blue
[5:19:55] <+paladinstarbuster> purple

[5:20:56] <DestroPrime83> *literal sadness*
[5:20:57] <+Grayhammatter> gamecube is purple
[5:21:00] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus Alternatively, if you were paying super attention, it was the color of the trio of enemy shields
[5:21:01] <Parapattern> What a wet fart of an ending
[5:21:02] <+LogothX> Why does that javelin look like a discount Atlas from Titanfall
[5:21:04] <thelonechris> Waow

[5:21:07] <Valdorick> Okay, so, you know how DIO and Jojo both had the same powers? Is woolie's stand just the echo fighter of [Crazy talk]?
[5:21:08] <%QueequegTheater> bits tho
[5:21:09] <+Mvrdok_> It looks kinda neat
[5:21:10] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus What Javelin are you gonna unlock and use first?
[5:21:11] <gustavozxd> is it really not good to end your life on a puzzle? hmm
[5:21:13] <MyNameIsRasus> It's not ridiculous, you're the only one on the "Not purple" side
[5:21:16] <+Irridium> you still got two more missions
[5:21:17] <loveplusearth> the game cube is totally purple
[5:21:18] <IndoorSitup> LOADING SCREENS

[5:21:30] <Goraka91> I like the yellow guy FeelsBadMan
[5:21:30] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:21:32] <Chocolate_Burrito> its indigo
[5:21:32] <Estuko> Best loading screens for me will always be Marvel Ultimate Alliance (original)
[5:21:34] <DatAsuna> Woolie's max smug
[5:21:36] <arkv01> fucking normies REEEe
[5:21:36] <DestroPrime83> Bronze

[5:21:38] <MayorRev> bumblebee is cool shut up
[5:21:39] <loudspeaka> Woolie VS literally everyone with eyes that work
[5:21:40] <+yuiyui984> you look like a dune buggie
[5:21:41] <releasethehounds0> "B E T T E R"

[5:21:45] <Skatedeandre> orange and black forever
[5:21:45] <+Noxyba> It's like a shitty EVA
[5:21:48] <Goraka91> 'Guy from Haze'
[5:21:49] <+LogothX> Platinum
[5:21:51] <+SuichiTanaka> Woolie should have played City of Heroes
[5:21:52] <Adriangabs> You look like a Watch Dogs 2 character Woolz
[5:21:52] <+VektorTroika> it's like gba sp gold
[5:21:53] <Valdorick> And yes, I did just called Jotaro "Jojo"
[5:21:53] <EASrake> The first time i did this mission, I couldn't activate the portals. Had to show the randos what color theyt were supposed to be
[5:21:54] <DestroPrime83> Bronze is what your looking for
[5:21:54] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie's taste in color is such fucking trash, he has to be joking, right
[5:21:56] <ScreamLord> Kinda looks like polished brass to me
[5:21:59] <dekkitout> yes in the original color scheme of raw secondary colors
[5:22:00] <Xaxas115> you got Eva unit 1, and a bumblebee, as well as hiyku shiki
[5:22:03] <%d00med_magus> @woolieversus more like waspintor
[5:22:03] <xeros720> now gurren lagann, that'd be good
[5:22:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie you look like a bootleg gunpla
[5:22:03] <%GarbageNirvana> The Golden Knights are my city's hockey team
[5:22:05] <%GarbageNirvana> So I mean
[5:22:08] <%Rezca> Nah, looks cool. Would Bang
[5:22:11] <%QueequegTheater> He did a big coward
[5:22:14] <+Jarellephant> i just want an orange gamecube
[5:22:15] <UmbraIra> @SuichiTanaka you made me sad rip CoX
[5:22:15] <@mothmandraws> or he was killed by loading screen
[5:22:18] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater He dyed his fucking hair those colors. LUL
[5:22:20] <@mothmandraws> he never made it out
[5:22:21] <+TeethMuncher> The colors are fine, it's the texture that's questionable
[5:22:21] <+AcidicHorizon> @WoolieVersus The bumblbee man the most stylish of all yall
[5:22:26] <Chocolate_Burrito> ?
[5:22:27] <camsmi7> Lurker?
[5:22:28] <%alrobot2014> didn't woolie get one of those grenade launchers last mission
[5:22:29] <Estuko> These guns look... awful...
[5:22:31] <Adriangabs> ?
[5:22:32] <Goraka91> Wat
[5:22:33] <Skatedeandre> they are guns
[5:22:35] <%QueequegTheater> @mechslayer71 WHY
[5:22:36] <+TheMorilo> what
[5:22:39] <+Grayhammatter> they are guns
[5:22:39] <+queaks> They are guns
[5:22:41] <+gantz_zero> only the heavy weapons are for colossus @WoolieVersus
[5:22:47] <MyNameIsRasus> They're guns for other frames
[5:22:49] <%QueequegTheater> Oh wait you meant in real life
[5:22:53] <DatAsuna> Yes these guns are guns
[5:22:54] <ransack426> lol
[5:22:54] <king_trito> Just use Assaunt rifle and heavy pistol. Youre set.
[5:22:59] <+krispen_wa> all of these look so not distinctive
[5:23:01] <ScreamLord> The Lurker is a Colossus weapon
[5:23:02] <Adriangabs> Is this Crazy Talk in action?
[5:23:03] <DestroPrime83> 3
[5:23:04] <+NiktenKing> Previously you got gear not weapons and a colossus gun
[5:23:05] <releasethehounds0> No syndanas 0/10
[5:23:05] <+Reveresao> lies
[5:23:06] <IndoorSitup> MORE LOADING SCREENS
[5:23:06] <DatAsuna> SOME of them are
[5:23:06] <%Chichen> other javelins 4Head
[5:23:06] <Skatedeandre> no
[5:23:09] <dekkitout> think like certain weapons for certain classes- wait, its exactly that...
[5:23:12] <%QueequegTheater> !raffle
[5:23:13] <Xaxas115> Gun go up?
[5:23:18] <gustavozxd> some very basic looking future guns
[5:23:19] <DatAsuna> It was a gun and one other thing that wasn't a gun
[5:23:21] <CrimsonCore90> "javelins"
[5:23:21] <Adriangabs> Ohhhhhhh
[5:23:23] <+gantz_zero> only huge heavy guns are for colossus, no other weapons are exclusive to suits @WoolieVersus
[5:23:27] <sileo_patronus> I appreciate that we're just calling them frames
[5:23:28] <+TeethMuncher> Gun to your head? Is this a gun?
[5:23:28] <EASrake> One guy
[5:23:29] <%Chichen> just fucking play warframe woolie
[5:23:30] <+Talavisto> i think the only seperate gun is heavys for colllus
[5:23:33] <+Kilik_> @WoolieVersus only the thicc boi frame can use heavy weapons
[5:23:36] <DatAsuna> You equip stuff in your powers slots
[5:23:43] <MonstarGrrrl> L O A D I N G S C R E E N
[5:23:43] <ransack426> not sure if i'll be found in the anthemverse
[5:23:45] <Adriangabs> I love how we just call them Frames now instead of Javelins LUL
[5:23:45] <superbla25> I love that Woolie called it a Frame.
[5:23:46] <Skatedeandre> javelins is good
[5:23:48] <%alrobot2014> still level 10
[5:23:51] <+NiktenKing> You are a Free Lancer using a Javelin...
[5:23:55] <Goraka91> Name any mech after a weapon and it's good
[5:23:56] <JetpackMcQuack> But sometimes we solve your puzzles, gotta take the good with the bad
[5:23:59] <+mechslayer71> STILL 10 LUL
[5:23:59] <Skatedeandre> LUL
[5:24:00] <+Karebuncle> its fine as long as its not a backronym
[5:24:02] <+Grayhammatter> level 10 still it seems
[5:24:02] <Skatedeandre> SLAVE
[5:24:04] <Xaxas115> Titan is pretty good
[5:24:05] <+Reveresao> how do you feel about all the loading screens guys?
[5:24:05] <+Cityscape17> how is the game so far Woolie? solid game worth getting hopefully?
[5:24:07] <xeros720> javellin is alright, i'm pretty ambivalent; those other ones are much better
[5:24:07] <Estuko> Armoured Slave is pretty good.
[5:24:08] <Goraka91> Orbital Frame PogChamp
[5:24:08] <Shisno27> level 12 was javelin unlock in the VIP beta, is it still like that?
[5:24:09] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus go talk to mathias
[5:24:09] <+LogothX> or Ayotan
[5:24:14] <CrimsonCore90> Armored Fighting Walker
[5:24:14] <+AcidicHorizon> how bout warframe
[5:24:15] <gustavozxd> or dolls Kappa
[5:24:16] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus which Javelin will you use next? At lvl 12 you can unlock a new one
[5:24:17] <+TeethMuncher> Guy on the left?
[5:24:17] <StarvingPenguinGod> Why won't the suit self destruct BibleThump
[5:24:21] <Xaxas115> why didnt they make this a Bioware Titanfall game?
[5:24:22] <naturalchilling> EVA
[5:24:22] <%QueequegTheater> Suplex her
[5:24:23] <EASrake> They should be called Atlatls
[5:24:25] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[5:24:26] <%alrobot2014> Guymelef and Orbital Frame are pretty good
[5:24:27] <RorschachAttack> who is that guy talking
[5:24:29] <Lizard0TM> @WoolieVersus Any Javelin can use any gun, and cannot be equipped anywhere else other than Forge
[5:24:29] <$KnivesEve> orbital frame is a good one
[5:24:30] <IndoorSitup> LOL
[5:24:30] <@mothmandraws> if you a freelancer they should be offering to pay you in exposure
[5:24:32] <arkv01> take her to mcdonalds
[5:24:32] <Estuko> Not giving your suit a self destruct feature is LAME
[5:24:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Imagine if the left stick isn't just "fly straight foward" but makes you go into flight mode, you start hovering and titling the stick in any direction makes you go in that direction without depending on the camera so you get 360 movement
[5:24:34] <Valdorick> Look at that loving crafted ass plate. A mechanic bled his fingers to the bone to craft that ass so that it might save humanity.
[5:24:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Or CHOU GINGA GURREN LAGANN
[5:24:36] <%QueequegTheater> ANIMATION
[5:24:39] <+AcidicHorizon> Eva will always be stronk
[5:24:41] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:24:47] <UnfilteredComic> If its only called a Javelin because it flies through the air then I will be so dissapointed
[5:24:49] <+LogothX> texture poops
[5:24:50] <dekkitout> or cataphract
[5:24:51] <Baeltyr> @mothmandraws self burn?
[5:24:52] <Goraka91> Why are we first personing the Bioware NPCs monkaS
[5:24:52] <gustavozxd> walking around as a regular guy is the last thing i wanna in a game with sick future armors
[5:24:54] <Skatedeandre> ill talk to this person but i dont care what they say LUL
[5:24:58] <xeros720> what were the names of the enemy suits in gurren lagann?
[5:25:00] <+LogothX> What about WANZERs
[5:25:01] <Parapattern> LUL
[5:25:01] <+phantomnmenace> can we get a sprint in the city ffs
[5:25:02] <ransack426> EA does it again, they knew no one wants PvP and just wants to farm loot with friends and randos without voice chat, so good
[5:25:03] <Adriangabs> notbad.jpg
[5:25:04] <MyNameIsRasus> oh fuck me then
[5:25:05] <+Kilik_> @WoolieVersus that's untrue
[5:25:05] <Shisno27> any javelin can NOT use any gun, that guy is FUCKING WRONG
[5:25:05] <+thecosmicfly> :\
[5:25:05] <releasethehounds0> Look at these sonic unleashed hoo-mans
[5:25:06] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[5:25:08] <+Grayhammatter> notbad
[5:25:12] <extradopeness> Gunmen
[5:25:13] <+gantz_zero> there's huge weapons only colossus can equip @WoolieVersus
[5:25:14] <+TeethMuncher> Is there no background chatter?
[5:25:16] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus HEavy weapons are colossus only
[5:25:17] <+Axellogic> Thats a lie Grenade launchers and autocannons are colossus only
[5:25:17] <%QueequegTheater> Yo what the fuck you can't just call people NPCs
[5:25:19] <xeros720> yeah GUNMEN, still love that one
[5:25:22] <@mothmandraws> not really teeth
[5:25:31] <%Rivalshotzgp> This is the liar stream, billy and chat lying to woolie
[5:25:31] <@mothmandraws> anthem appears to be a very quiet game
[5:25:32] <ScreamLord> There are some heavy weapons that only the Colossus can use
[5:25:32] <eyedol33> Thats not true. There are weapons specific to the colossus at least
[5:25:32] <+LogothX> ..>You mean EGYPT
[5:25:34] <@mothmandraws> no one talks
[5:25:36] <Estuko> monkaS jeez you can't just ask someone why they're an NPC @QueequegTheater
[5:25:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Osiris?
[5:25:37] <@mothmandraws> and very little music
[5:25:38] <@mothmandraws> just guns
[5:25:40] <+paladinstarbuster> Anubis?
[5:25:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Anubis yeah
[5:25:47] <Goraka91> EFF THAT
[5:25:48] <dekkitout> the shitty 2 cp assault map?
[5:25:48] <+Kilik_> @WoolieVersus that's untrue, only the colossus can use heavy weapons, but it can't use pistols
[5:25:50] <releasethehounds0> hello hello hello
[5:25:50] <+WeepProphet> I see Bioware still can't code hair
[5:25:51] <Skatedeandre> yes
[5:25:53] <MForan98> There's gun explicitly only for the Colossus, Grenade Launchers, Auto Cannons, and other heavy
[5:25:54] <ScreamLord> Yeah
[5:25:56] <WayneTheNerd> This Definitely seems like a warframe clone
[5:25:57] <%QueequegTheater> I wish Mercy was here
[5:25:58] <ransack426> lol no hair
[5:25:58] <NeedlesD> p much
[5:26:02] <Baeltyr> omg what if it does have an AC tie in Kappa
[5:26:02] <EASrake> emphasis on WALKING
[5:26:06] <%QueequegTheater> Then I might be able to pay attention
[5:26:07] <+yuiyui984> Is this asmr?
[5:26:11] <%alrobot2014> i wish any music was here
[5:26:18] <%alrobot2014> its really bothering me
[5:26:18] <ScreamLord> Close Caption is hilarious
[5:26:20] <king_trito> This what happens when Warframe and Monster Hunter have a love child. I personally think the game is fun.
[5:26:22] <ransack426> asmr nice
[5:26:23] <releasethehounds0> Why would I leave my pornhub Mercy vids for this
[5:26:23] <UnfilteredComic> @mothmandraws the city at night has nice ambiance of people talking and distant music but other than that, yeah
[5:26:28] <+Lixagon> NO DO THE BORING CUTSCENE SECTIONS
[5:26:30] <Valdorick> I... what the hell was that, bro? You just placed it on the object, you didn't wire it or anything!
[5:26:31] <$RocketShot_> Anthem is just lesser warframe
[5:26:31] <Goraka91> Yo for real though where is the music
[5:26:34] <thelonechris> I thought your character was a weird alien in purple armor before this walking around part
[5:26:35] <%QueequegTheater> "I put it one the table and clicked the button WTF"
[5:26:36] <SGrim> @WoolieVersus But the story! LuL
[5:26:40] <EASrake> you do if you want to equip your new weapons
[5:26:41] <Skatedeandre> LUL
[5:26:42] <%QueequegTheater> OH FUCK YOU
[5:26:42] <MyNameIsRasus> Riveting plot tho
[5:26:44] <dekkitout> its youand your stand in warframe
[5:26:46] <Valdorick> And now he is dead.
[5:26:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> But Woolie, there's no camp to change equipment in the field
[5:26:48] <+MagicBeanBurrito> OH
[5:26:52] <@mothmandraws> is this a rick and morty episode?
[5:26:53] <+TheMorilo> what a genius
[5:26:53] <%QueequegTheater> @dekkitout SPOILERS
[5:26:56] <+Kilik_> @WoolieVersus they said they are adding a social hub in the main game
[5:26:56] <JetpackMcQuack> lol he hit it, that was a good joke
[5:26:58] <camsmi7> handsy
[5:27:02] <+badmr7> That's how I fixed my coffee machine
[5:27:05] <Estuko> monkaS does that thing have a Stand Ability?
[5:27:06] <+Lixagon> Urrg
[5:27:06] <keiji_maede> love this part
[5:27:10] <+krispen_wa> Oh shit Woolie's love for naruto has brought in Kage bunshins
[5:27:11] <%QueequegTheater> THOSE MEAN THE SAME THING YOU FUCKING HACKS
[5:27:13] <laguerrilha> There can be only one!
[5:27:15] <UnfilteredComic> Mass Effect Goofs
[5:27:20] <thelonechris> Oh it's his different emotions
[5:27:21] <%Rezca> is this a bad star trek episode?
[5:27:24] <+TheMorilo> Dude I would totally fuck myself
[5:27:25] <+MagicBeanBurrito> I like this one part
[5:27:27] <MayorRev> DISGUSTED NOISE
[5:27:30] <xeros720> exactly what i was thinking, shitty star trek
[5:27:31] <extradopeness> Skorpdrop
[5:27:31] <JetpackMcQuack> The first one was annoying enough
[5:27:32] <viciousgrim> skip lol
[5:27:32] <JobbedBone> this is dumb
[5:27:33] <ransack426> its a bad anthem episode
[5:27:34] <CrimsonCore90> what's with all these CAWs?
[5:27:34] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater That was his point...
[5:27:37] <camsmi7> skorp drop!
[5:27:37] <Ninjagregory98> This is so garbage holy shit
[5:27:38] <%Freelance7> This sounds annoying
[5:27:40] <DatAsuna> I only like the surly one
[5:27:41] <%UrsulaCat> yeah just do it again
[5:27:42] <laguerrilha> Resolve this in Mortal Combat!
[5:27:43] <%LowEnergyStarman> Look at this VA earning his paycheck
[5:27:44] <+cirilionaire> now none of us will be virgins
[5:27:44] <Goraka91> It's totally a Star Trek episode LUL
[5:27:44] <%alrobot2014> there were 3?
[5:27:45] <+PatStaresAt> what, I just came back
[5:27:49] <+PatStaresAt> why are all three of them the same person
[5:27:50] <ScreamLord> Amplification is NOT the same as Multiplication
[5:27:51] <+PatStaresAt> what is happening
[5:27:53] <%QueequegTheater> "We wanted to have Mordin again but couldn't pay the VA"
[5:27:55] <Deadpool2450> this is like a really bad star trek voyager episode
[5:27:56] <prime_name> Get out of my face.
[5:27:56] <Valdorick> Fuck eachother
[5:27:58] <thelonechris> Make out with each other
[5:28:00] <+LogothX> Jerk eachother off
[5:28:00] <+Imperial_Madman> kiss
[5:28:00] <dekkitout> oh, this is that one episode where someone is split into id, ego, super
[5:28:02] <EASrake> you know what Kreygasm
[5:28:04] <xeros720> ahaha, it really is a voyager episode
[5:28:06] <+LogothX> Poop in eachothers butts to save your lives
[5:28:07] <bird_nest> What did I go into to?
[5:28:08] <+phatmac16> Remember how cool Mass Effect was
[5:28:08] <%QueequegTheater> That funny joke was ruined by the voice actor
[5:28:08] <%thechungiestofbois> @AngriestPat space magic
[5:28:09] <releasethehounds0> Now NONE of us will die virgins
[5:28:10] <Louie_Salmon> God, how is there no music
[5:28:11] <goroke> nice bioware writing
[5:28:11] <MayorRev> okay that was kinda neat
[5:28:11] <Parapattern> ResidentSleeper Zzzzzz
[5:28:12] <extradopeness> tlc match!
[5:28:12] <+mechslayer71> These guys are really not great
[5:28:13] <%alrobot2014> @AngriestPat they decided to hit the quest item and it multiplied them
[5:28:14] <+Grayhammatter> he hit the thing on a platform, and then split himself
[5:28:14] <+thecosmicfly> Man, imagine if after this scene you could hold a full conversation with fleshed out dialogue trees with all three of these Matthias's. What a wasted opportunity.
[5:28:15] <EyeFarted> SELF EIFFEL TOWER
[5:28:18] <+VektorTroika> that was actually a fun little skit
[5:28:19] <keiji_maede> more then destiny
[5:28:19] <Estuko> @TheMorilo why not just have one of your clone go to your job a day of the week so all of your clones go at least a day out of the whole week. Noone would know! and you still get paid!
[5:28:20] <+bigb00gi3> I didn't see plot occur, just quipping
[5:28:22] <Goraka91> Look at those 3 Harry Kims
[5:28:23] <CrimsonCore90> If you have sex with your clone is it masturbation?
[5:28:23] <+Grayhammatter> plot
[5:28:25] <%QueequegTheater> Mass Effect had an amaing ~3.4 games
[5:28:26] <Ninjagregory98> So that’s just straight up magic
[5:28:28] <+LogothX> They should poop in eachothers butts to resolve the plot
[5:28:28] <+Rorinator> Hahaha, is middle name isn't really the thing he said, hilarious.
[5:28:30] <viciousgrim> loot game are for the loot not the story lol
[5:28:31] <Baeltyr> when do you get the big suit :P
[5:28:31] <%QueequegTheater> *amazing
[5:28:33] <Toudeleski> You know he's just making out with himself
[5:28:34] <zamzoph> MY OWN CLONE!
[5:28:37] <Estuko> @CrimsonCore90 selfcest
[5:28:37] <Skatedeandre> they got split in three because of the mcguffin
[5:28:47] <MyNameIsRasus> L O A D
[5:28:49] <+Grayhammatter> customize your boost
[5:28:49] <Shisno27> gee if you didn't want to watch the cutscene maybe you should have HELD THE SKIP BUTTON
[5:28:50] <Dehlome> what is life if not boosting
[5:28:50] <extradopeness> Yikes
[5:28:50] <%Rezca> they can run a self-cest train I guess

[5:28:52] <+TheMorilo> @Estuko I can do that AND fuck myself
[5:28:54] <Valdorick> I'm sure that room is going to be full of 'plot', if you know what I mean. One of them is going to being a 'pizza', wink wink. Some 'pipe' will be laid, hue hue. They're fucking.

[5:31:13] <ValentineHearts> No i shit on it because its bad. Its one of the most dull mmorpgs ive ever seen and that says a lot in a genre known for being dull.
[5:31:15] <DestroPrime83> @AngriestPat We need an Emergancy RE2 Stream to save us from this nightmare

[5:31:49] <%ventus_fury> what have I missed about this game?
[5:31:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Just be like Paige, eat on stream, show feet
[5:31:51] <Estuko> @QueequegTheater I like crafting weapons, my main gripe was the pipe gun they made that could have such a huge variation in customization. It's so ugly.
[5:31:53] <%bananakko> mukbang stream! woolieMIRIN
[5:31:54] <+Dylveryn> This isn't really a Warframe competitor tho
[5:31:54] <@mothmandraws> eat during the custscenes
[5:31:54] <Goraka91> EA doesn't make games. Their minions make games until they're shut down
[5:31:55] <+Grayhammatter> WOW
[5:31:56] <extradopeness> NO MUKBANG PLS
[5:31:56] <Adriangabs> remember, we don't how far EA is willing to go with this game when it comes to content, WF keeps giving FREE content throughout the year

[5:34:45] <@mothmandraws> this is first battle music we heard
[5:34:46] <+Grayhammatter> that's not good
[5:34:47] <UnfilteredComic> because it wasnt LUL
[5:34:47] <%alrobot2014> the music may be forgettable but at least its here now
[5:34:50] <DestroPrime83> musics as dull as the gameplay
[5:34:56] <@mothmandraws> which really sucks as title screen had a cool song
[5:34:56] <MyNameIsRasus> "Because we were FUCKING CHILDREN" - Pat Boivin, 2019
[5:34:58] <%alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus there was no music last mission
[5:35:02] <EASrake> This game has some serious audio issues
[5:35:02] <releasethehounds0> Wait so this game has some DmC: Devil May Cry coloured enemies shit?
[5:35:11] <+thecosmicfly> @ScreamingMeat wait this is the same room from earlier? lmao

[5:36:50] <%Life_of_Mamba> More lore for the fan fic
[5:36:52] <%ventus_fury> "I don't care about the other players, I care about _____" problem with these kinds of games lol (Except in this guy's case)
[5:36:53] <+TheMorilo> One thing this game did for me is highlighting how important the random levels are in Warframe
[5:36:53] <releasethehounds0> Billy is a gentle lover. He holds back while hittin' thst back.
[5:36:55] <goroke> Colossus or bust
[5:36:56] <UnfilteredComic> Does Battleborn qualify as a Cryptid
[5:36:56] <ScreamLord> @thecosmicfly The goo samples they take are the remains of those 3 storms they fought in the puzzle room
[5:36:57] <@mothmandraws> billy ccan you speed up the loading screens
[5:36:57] <$TIME_PUNCHER> This kind of looks more like Warframe, but if it was Destiny. Seems a lil clunky
[5:36:57] <%alrobot2014> @king_trito their games have nice music that THEY NEGLECT TO USE over and over
[5:36:59] <Goraka91> Interceptor is the anime one right?
[5:37:04] <BlacSoul> Aww
[5:37:06] <camsmi7> get Storm
[5:37:10] <Parapattern> Who is talking? Is that Woolie's character's voice?
[5:37:11] <+mechslayer71> @goraka91 Yeah
[5:37:11] <+Reizie_Etherealm> So basically Woolie wanna progress past this early grind
[5:37:12] <dekkitout> battleborn is a mass hallucination
[5:37:15] <DestroPrime83> @mothmandraws But that song was stright fire and you cant find it anywhere without the shitty background audio from the game
[5:37:18] <sporktown_heroine> I think I would be much more interested in this story if it were in the future and not just a weird world
[5:37:19] <EASrake> Billy is trying so hard to accommodate Woolie
[5:37:25] <Goraka91> Not even any loot in it
[5:37:27] <viciousgrim> it is up more
[5:37:33] <%Life_of_Mamba> Billy, He protect He Attack He got Woolies Back
[5:37:37] <Estuko> I WISH there was ragdoll when you land not on oyur feet LUL smash your face against walls or floors
[5:37:38] <%ventus_fury> Battleborn? What is that? Never heard of it... (Looks around)
[5:37:39] <+Grayhammatter> you'll have to go up prolly
[5:37:39] <+TeethMuncher> Echo chamber aside, I think this could be good in a year or so
[5:37:49] <DatAsuna> gonna be hard to tell him on a delay
[5:37:49] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersus That waterfall was the water area
[5:37:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Bioware plots are known for how bland they are
[5:37:50] <sporktown_heroine> They should base missions around exploring the cool landscape and not testing the soil
[5:37:50] <%ventus_fury> You mean the dead overwatch wannabe?
[5:37:51] <+Lixagon> Game dosnt even have space milfs Kappa
[5:37:52] <goroke> nice landing
[5:37:53] <Valdorick> Aw man, Battleborn had great porn too, like that one image of the angel medic lady giving 'healing' to the blueskinned sniper lady, and the Asian mech pilot Kappa
[5:37:54] <$TIME_PUNCHER> It's pretty at least
[5:38:01] <@mothmandraws> I think the game should half HP values and double enemy numbers
[5:38:02] <Estuko> @ventus_fury B-but they have porn too! remember! LUL
[5:38:06] <@mothmandraws> more dudes
[5:38:11] <DatAsuna> I've done this mission and don't remember it making you dive
[5:38:17] <+Grayhammatter> diamond woolie
[5:38:18] <%ventus_fury> I'm aware but it was so weird to my tastes lol
[5:38:19] <DestroPrime83> WHy is noone Agreeing with me that Deltron 3030's Countdown from Battleborn was the shit?
[5:38:20] <king_trito> For real, this game is fun as shit. ME: Andromeda had its issues, but the fighting was amazing. I just hope they fix whatever netcode issues they have and ride this game like Ubisoft does with Wildlands.
[5:38:23] <laguerrilha> I looked at Jim review of it and Battleborn didnt seem like a bad game. Was just burried by Blizzard and fans
[5:38:24] <IndoorSitup> Whoaaaa
[5:38:27] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I'm down with getting past this slogging through this early game swamp to see what's beyond
[5:38:27] <sileo_patronus> @mothmandraws yeah I was just thinking how there seemed to be so few enemies
[5:38:27] <releasethehounds0> This game should go commit equalizer taunt
[5:38:31] <@mothmandraws> because no one remembers it baron
[5:38:33] <MyNameIsRasus> If a game has no space MILFs then it's shite. it's the law
[5:38:35] <DestroPrime83> REEEE
[5:38:36] <Goraka91> Bioware doesn't have good writers anymore anyway
[5:38:37] <@mothmandraws> ppl forget battleborn was real
[5:38:39] <Adriangabs> Is Battleborn a spaghetti because I'm going to need some sauce here Kappa
[5:38:43] <valriot> Woo Woolie, you seen the rumours about the Titanfall-verse BR game apparently coming on Monday?
[5:38:44] <viciousgrim> go back to the falls and go up a little more @WoolieVersus
[5:38:47] <%ventus_fury> I got that game for free and just gave it away to a friend lol
[5:38:55] <DestroPrime83> I want that song to live beyond its legacy!
[5:38:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Battle-who? Kappa
[5:38:56] <+VektorTroika> Woolie do combo good
[5:38:57] <Estuko> @valriot with no Titans? FeelsBadMan
[5:38:57] <+paladinstarbuster> do combo
[5:38:58] <+Grayhammatter> was battleborn even real?
[5:38:59] <UnfilteredComic> DO COMBO
[5:39:00] <goroke> do combo
[5:39:02] <king_trito> @MyNameIsRasus No samara no buy SwiftRage
[5:39:04] <+Grayhammatter> do combo
[5:39:07] <@mothmandraws> now lawbreakers
[5:39:10] <@mothmandraws> thast the real meme
[5:39:13] <Valdorick> Something something FireFall.
[5:39:14] <valriot> @estuko Is that comfirmed though?,
[5:39:14] <Parapattern> *Me with an eyepatch sitting at a dingy bar smoking a cigar* "Battleborne? I haven't heard that name in years..."
[5:39:17] <%ventus_fury> Lawbreakers is the real thing?
[5:39:19] <Goraka91> Battleborn was actually assassinated by Blizzard
[5:39:24] <goroke> Urgh Firefall was shit
[5:39:25] <%ventus_fury> Is it even up for sale still?
[5:39:28] <UnfilteredComic> Which is worse though?
[5:39:28] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Radical Heights?
[5:39:30] <%UrsulaCat> what's the ship name
[5:39:32] <laguerrilha> Lawbreakers was legit nothing
[5:39:34] <Pandora_Prime> Anthem? More like Slowframe.
[5:39:35] <Estuko> @mothmandraws Wasn't the dude who produced/dev'd the game an absolute jerk to his fans? or was that someone else
[5:39:36] <@mothmandraws> thanos arrived
[5:39:38] <Adriangabs> Goddamn I completely forgot about Lawbreakers until someone mentioned it
[5:39:42] <king_trito> Lawbreakers was a legit fun game too, too bad it got buried by the other clones.
[5:39:44] <+gantz_zero> your melee is a "primer", your grenade is a detonator @WoolieVersus
[5:39:49] <dekkitout> heres an oldie, who remembered brink
[5:39:52] <StonerStan101> @WoolieVersus They went to the shadowrealm.
[5:39:52] <ScreamLord> Anthem seems like it can be a really good game. It's just feels like Eldritch Abomination's, I mean EA's likely going to fuck it up somehow
[5:39:53] <Estuko> @valriot if anything it might be grabs or loot they can obtain bbut that's what I heard.
[5:39:55] <@mothmandraws> ye he was somewhat
[5:40:02] <%ventus_fury> Lawbreakers was a poor overwatch clone though
[5:40:05] <Estuko> billy's laugh gives me life
[5:40:06] <+TeethMuncher> They're out on lunch break
[5:40:09] <%UrsulaCat> boolie
[5:40:15] <%ventus_fury> Can't be cloned if it is a clone
[5:40:16] <%UrsulaCat> nah that sucks
[5:40:24] <+Irridium> man I wish bioware would make a tight, not big open-world esque rpg again
[5:40:28] <Adriangabs> A lot of studios tried to clone Overwatch back then
[5:40:29] <Goraka91> I feel like there is too much happening on screen
[5:40:35] <BlacSoul> I liked Brink, just needed literally any game mode besides story
[5:40:39] <king_trito> @ScreamingMeat Theyre going by Warframes model, i think the problem will be that it will water drip content instead of putting out challenges or community events.
[5:40:40] <StonerStan101> A clone of a clone is........quickly give me a name.
[5:40:43] <Valdorick> Ah yes, LawBreakers, from Cliffy B, the biggest trend chaser ever.
[5:40:47] <count_bob> Ben Riley.
[5:40:51] <%UrsulaCat> cloclonene
[5:40:54] <+gantz_zero> grenade after melee for combo @WoolieVersus
[5:40:56] <+Grayhammatter> spidercide
[5:40:58] <valriot> @estuko I cant imagine theyd cut out the MAIN point of Titanfall but still. Pilots feel amazing in that game anyway, ill be fine with like 50/50 Titan and Pilot gameplay
[5:41:00] <Goraka91> @BlacSoul I thought I was the only one FeelsBadMan
[5:41:01] <goroke> that shade of purple is way too bright
[5:41:01] <laguerrilha> Blizzard is know to murder the competition with aggressive marketing tactics. They launched Overwatch free beta on the day Battleborn was released
[5:41:01] <dekkitout> a bad spiderman saga?
[5:41:02] <+MagicBeanBurrito> bone clone
[5:41:02] <+Grayhammatter> or kane parker
[5:41:02] <+timblenaut> im surprised Woolie isn't getting motion sickness from this, the screenshake is so intense
[5:41:03] <%ventus_fury> Anything in the Chinese game devs hands?
[5:41:05] <%TeethMuncher> @Goraka91 I think the issue is that all the effect are a bit too bright and sudden
[5:41:08] <Shisno27> there's not enough happening on screen, cause woolie doesn't use his abilities often enough
[5:41:14] <dekkitout> that writters can never seem to forget...
[5:41:16] <%ventus_fury> Thats plenty of cloned clones
[5:41:16] <Parapattern> It's almost like EA assigned Bioware to a type of game that they have no experience in so that they can close the studio down...
[5:41:27] <MyNameIsRasus> I thought the big open world craze had worn itself out but sadly it didn't it seems
[5:41:33] <+gantz_zero> chemtrails though @Parapattern
[5:41:34] <king_trito> @Parapattern They made an MMO before lol
[5:41:45] <UnfilteredComic> @Parapattern I mean its not awful
[5:41:49] <Estuko> @valriot that'd be okay, I'm not excellent in titan v titan gameplay unfortunately, first person shooters are a weak point for me and mechs are just slow enough and in my lane for me to be pretty capable. Makes it hard to play with people and not have them yell at me FeelsBadMan
[5:41:50] <valriot> Whats infuriating about this game is that it shouldve just been a Mass Effect Online
[5:41:52] <Valdorick> Press F in honor of Maxis and Westwood.
[5:42:01] <%ventus_fury> F
[5:42:03] <Estuko> @valriot pilot v pilote I mean, lol I like titan v titna
[5:42:03] <count_bob> God no.
[5:42:05] <$TIME_PUNCHER> I think I know how I feel about Anthem now. It's Gears of Warframe that needs a lil more Vanquish
[5:42:05] <king_trito> @valriot F
[5:42:13] <count_bob> Fans would have torn Mass Effect online apart.
[5:42:15] <count_bob> And you know it.
[5:42:16] <+Grayhammatter> F
[5:42:18] <ScreamLord> @king_trito Well I think I'm going to wait a little while before I buy it. See what news pops up around it and get it a little cheaper. Might even get the Legion of Dawn edition
[5:42:20] <+TheMorilo> The enemy HUD even looks like Mass Effect
[5:42:23] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus you can only get one new javelin in the demo
[5:42:26] <Goraka91> Speaking of Gears of War, they're now known for Fortnite how weird is that
[5:42:33] <@mothmandraws> should have been a 40k Tau themed MMO
[5:42:37] <ScreamLord> Might
[5:42:43] <valriot> I mean the gameplay IS from Andromeda, which was unironically fantastic
[5:42:43] <Parapattern> Bioware is good a narrative and dialogue heavy games. Multiplayer shooting was never the strong point of any of their games.
[5:42:47] <Estuko> Does this game have landing impact if you fly towards the ground and land hard? or is it just a sumple thud
[5:42:47] <Goraka91> 40k getting good games LUL
[5:42:47] <joseph122788> So is this game good or bad chat?
[5:42:48] <+Grayhammatter> look at the destiny tank
[5:42:51] <king_trito> I hope Woolie gets the Devastator Sniper, that thing does MAD damage.
[5:42:51] <dekkitout> gars of war got assimilated into fortnite?
[5:42:54] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Oh right, Epic Games does Fortnite
[5:42:55] <viciousgrim> i want a 40k mmo
[5:42:55] <BlacSoul> @goraka91 It had good gun play, class and body balancing, and diverse maps, but I think people hated the down system and the high time to kill
[5:42:55] <WackyModder84> @mothmandraws Should have been a 40k Themes MMO AS A WHOLE. #RIPDarkMillenium #NeverForget
[5:42:57] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @TIME_PUNCHER You can't expect a western game developer company to pull of a vanquish, they are unable to
[5:43:07] <@mothmandraws> I want a nercomunda MMO
[5:43:08] <+LogothX> Conveniently placed waist high walls
[5:43:12] <sileo_patronus> @joseph122788 it exists
[5:43:13] <+TheMorilo> Battlefleet Gothic Armada is awesome. Mechanicus is cool
[5:43:15] <@mothmandraws> the art from todays reveals really makes me want one
[5:43:15] <ScreamLord> Andromeda was a lot of things, but the combat was NOT boring
[5:43:22] <$TIME_PUNCHER> @Reizie_Etherealm Canada maybe could :P
[5:43:39] <Ropcord> andromeda is a good but flawed game
[5:43:47] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Hey so that new titanfall battle royale game that's being rumored to drop monday apparently doesn't even have titans
[5:43:52] <viciousgrim> blood for the blood god skulls for the skull throne lol
[5:43:55] <DatAsuna> When they spin and jump up in front of him, that's a cue to dash xD
[5:43:55] <king_trito> @ScreamingMeat It had the best combat of the entire series.
[5:43:58] <+phatmac16> They should make a fate battle royale game
[5:43:59] <Ropcord> and it's optimized like shit :T
[5:43:59] <+Das_Prints> Just joined in, how's woolie liking this so far or did he just start?
[5:44:01] <Estuko> I haven't kept up with Andromeda, how have they done? update wise?
[5:44:03] <MyNameIsRasus> I think I might have pissed him off. Maybe because I SHOT HIM IN THE FACE
[5:44:08] <UnfilteredComic> Yea
[5:44:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @TIME_PUNCHER You're totally right, I forgot about warframe for a hot second
[5:44:16] <+Dylveryn> @Das_Prints he's meh so far
[5:44:17] <+mechslayer71> Yeah
[5:44:20] <valriot> @screamingmeat Mhm, it was extremely fun. It was basically this but with more interesting and established power and class builds
[5:44:20] <EASrake> big damage
[5:44:24] <dekkitout> youre telling me a titanfall br doesnt give titans to the last 3-5 people standing? wack
[5:44:29] <sileo_patronus> You can probably also just fly away from the mines
[5:44:31] <+Das_Prints> @Dylveryn Alright, thanks.
[5:44:33] <Adriangabs> I actually want to go back to Andromeda if they actually made an effort to fix it
[5:44:38] <@mothmandraws> honestly
[5:44:39] <Goraka91> Bioware's strength was writing, when they lost that Bioware effectively died
[5:44:42] <%ventus_fury> So I'm gonna start a new question set here since it "might" be one for woolie. @WoolieVersus How do you feel about Negan being in Tekken 7 soon?
[5:44:43] <@mothmandraws> titanfall battle royal
[5:44:45] <@mothmandraws> should start in mechs
[5:44:49] <@mothmandraws> and final 2 ppl get out
[5:44:51] <@mothmandraws> and fight 1v1
[5:44:52] <Ropcord> they patched some of the face issues and changed a bit of the dialog, i know that for sure
[5:44:57] <Valdorick> Reminder that plague is 100% right... """"BioWare""""
[5:45:04] <laguerrilha> Just like gundam 79
[5:45:12] <dekkitout> that also works, just gimme a br with mechs in it
[5:45:17] <+Grayhammatter> """Bioware""""
[5:45:17] <+TheMorilo> @Estuko They stopped updating Andromeda on patch 1.10
[5:45:20] <Goraka91> Also didn't the founders leave to brew beer or something?
[5:45:23] <valriot> Andromeda is a 6/10, but with a year of dev time, it wouldve been an 8
[5:45:26] <Adriangabs> @mothmandraws they 1v1 each other while jumping around the fallen Titans
[5:45:28] <+VektorTroika> my favorite """Bioware""" is Sonic Chronicles
[5:45:29] <ScreamLord> More like """""""""""""BioWare"""""""""""""
[5:45:34] <%Freelance7> load
[5:45:35] <+thecosmicfly> Apex Legends (That Titanfall BR) apparently doesn't even have parkour.
[5:45:36] <WackyModder84> the Motion Blur in this game is atrociously bad.
[5:45:45] <hntronium> !uptime
[5:45:45] <Goraka91> Negan is like...why?
[5:45:50] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Well we know literaly no details about it other than it's F2P and class based
[5:45:51] <MonstarGrrrl> LUL
[5:45:54] <$RilsRislan> lul
[5:45:56] <+gantz_zero> you're close to Interceptor, story is good XP @WoolieVersus
[5:45:57] <Ropcord> sonic chronicles > mass effect 1 fight me
[5:45:57] <Estuko> I'm trying to figure out who Negan's addition to Tekken was for LUL
[5:45:58] <+Irridium> Apparently Walkind Dead is super big in Japan for reason
[5:45:58] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @thecosmicfly also fuck that
[5:45:58] <hntronium> How long has Woolie been going?
[5:46:00] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:46:01] <valriot> The flaws are BIG but theres actually a lot in Andromeda thats genuinely good and has potential
[5:46:03] <laguerrilha> LUL
[5:46:04] <Fabric_tester> Negan is now a videogame character
[5:46:06] <hntronium> I just got here
[5:46:08] <MyNameIsRasus> I'm still mad about Kiryu
[5:46:09] <talldarkandintroverted> they should put in . anthem men
[5:46:10] <+krispen_wa> the show's name is appropriate for what it is
[5:46:10] <Goraka91> Wait Japan loves WD?
[5:46:10] <@mothmandraws> its always going to be a wierd pick
[5:46:11] <+LogothX> He prays to his bat
[5:46:12] <WackyModder84> Negan would have made more sense in something like Mortal Kombat
[5:46:15] <%QueequegTheater> Jeffrey Dean Morgan is GREAT as Negan, but the rest of the show was really shit this season
[5:46:15] <WackyModder84> not fucking Tekken
[5:46:19] <laguerrilha> I stopped after Season 3. Waste of time
[5:46:20] <+MrIntake> if anything the governor should of been picked instead of negan
[5:46:28] <@mothmandraws> unless walking dead final season was a tekken fighting tournie
[5:46:28] <king_trito> Shaggy is in MK and Negan is in Tekken, what a world.
[5:46:29] <%fatal_penguin_> Motion blur hides bad frame rates
[5:46:31] <Valdorick> Big Feats for big ProTag
[5:46:31] <@mothmandraws> its going to remain wierd
[5:46:32] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Have you learned to read bits yet
[5:46:34] <ScreamLord> Next lvl and you can get a new Javelin
[5:46:34] <+MrIntake> but yeah its an odd pick overall
[5:46:34] <Goraka91> It's literally a franchise zombie
[5:46:39] <Estuko> I'm fond of Negan's cursing and going SHIT when he gets knocked on his ass lol
[5:46:40] <%Rezca> we're all soldier's now
[5:46:44] <king_trito> Turn off motion blur, games better
[5:46:46] <Adriangabs> @QueequegTheater Yeah, too bad he's not in a lot of episodes
[5:46:48] <Parapattern> Look at those two same-oids on the right
[5:47:01] <+gantz_zero> story is your best option @WoolieVersus
[5:47:03] <talldarkandintroverted> put in that memorable character from the ea hit anthem
[5:47:06] <%QueequegTheater> "So I've been grinding offscreen"
[5:47:08] <+VektorTroika> literal rando jobbers
[5:47:20] <Goraka91> Just put Geralt in everything LUL
[5:47:25] <+thecosmicfly> Y'know how the formula is "It's Battle Royale but with X", it's as if that Titanfall BR is just forgetting that last part
[5:47:30] <%ventus_fury> @WoolieVersus Who would you have rather seen a bit more specifically? I'm thinking Kiryu or Majima would have been a hell of a lot better choices
[5:47:37] <valriot> Wow, thats literally just the Cranifex pistol from ME
[5:47:39] <laguerrilha> Put 2B on everything. it would sell more for the teens
[5:47:42] <%QueequegTheater> Lucatiel deserves to be in crossovers
[5:47:44] <%TeethMuncher> They really should let you compare stats to what you have equipped
[5:47:44] <Goraka91> Speaking of which isn't Final Fantasy getting a Nier crossover?
[5:47:45] <@mothmandraws> put in goku
[5:47:45] <+Irridium> they should put goku in tekken
[5:47:48] <valriot> *carnifex
[5:47:53] <%QueequegTheater> Put her and Vengarl in Soul Calibur
[5:48:01] <ScreamLord> There is no point in collecting materials because you can't craft anything in the demo
[5:48:05] <MyNameIsRasus> If P5R ain't P5 Rumble I'm fucking done
[5:48:05] <Adriangabs> Put Sora in Tekken, that would get the pre-teen demographic
[5:48:08] <%QueequegTheater> Vengarl can be a grappler
[5:48:08] <pigvideogames> i would preffer picolo in tekken, hes a better fit
[5:48:13] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Not mech enough for me
[5:48:20] <laguerrilha> Put Kenny on Tekken
[5:48:20] <+VektorTroika> the carnifex is literally just a zerg from warhammer 40k
[5:48:20] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @Goraka91 more like yoko is just working on it.At least that's what i gathered.
[5:48:21] <Ropcord> put cayde-6 and excalibur in smash as clones
[5:48:22] <Estuko> @ventus_fury a youtube comment said that it'd be rad if at the end of the tiger's toe game negan was doing the last person he pointed to would've bene Kiryu as a teaser
[5:48:29] <%UrsulaCat> I'm tired chat should I sleep
[5:48:33] <%TeethMuncher> @MyNameIsRasus Persona 5 Rumble Roses
[5:48:33] <Ropcord> yes
[5:48:34] <%QueequegTheater> no
[5:48:38] <EASrake> your's is 10 atm
[5:48:39] <+bear_breaker20> So THESE are the Woolie hours huh?
[5:48:40] <@mothmandraws> im only staying awake to see interceptor
[5:48:40] <MyNameIsRasus> Put Dingo in Tekken
[5:48:41] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Maybe
[5:48:42] <Goraka91> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS Nah there's a full blown Nier raid
[5:48:46] <%QueequegTheater> WOOLIE
[5:48:49] <dekkitout> dont- the memory of anthem is too fresh
[5:48:53] <ScreamLord> Number goes up
[5:49:02] <Estuko> I could totally fall asleep playing this game
[5:49:07] <+gantz_zero> please get the interceptor @WoolieVersus
[5:49:08] <goroke> MUKBANG
[5:49:08] <Adriangabs> Eat the Kirby lamp
[5:49:12] <%QueequegTheater> Oh no he's getting sucked in
[5:49:13] <%ventus_fury> That so @Estuko ? I didn't follow that in the trailer, coulda be anyone in my eyes
[5:49:14] <+Grayhammatter> just eat woolie
[5:49:14] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @Goraka91 ah okay.I knew he was working on a raid of some sort but wasn't aware it was nier based
[5:49:14] <Ropcord> monkaS
[5:49:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> BREAK!!
[5:49:15] <goroke> ANTHEM MUKBANG
[5:49:17] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[5:49:18] <+MagicBeanBurrito> I N T E R C E P T O R

[5:51:45] <$RilsRislan> Isn't that his ult
[5:51:46] <%ventus_fury> I know its on ps4, but is he playing on PS4 is the question you should ask
[5:51:47] <dekkitout> hydrobot is the strongest guy, and is so coo, and doesnt afraid of nobody
[5:51:48] <ShockedPachydurm> I am happy to see Woolie's Iron-man fantasy is coming to life
[5:51:49] <+NiktenKing> You have to hold it Woolie
[5:51:50] <%alrobot2014> probably came as a result of people dehydrating
[5:51:52] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus 1 ult per frame
[5:51:58] <+gantz_zero> your R1 tracks if you point it at someone @WoolieVersus
[5:51:58] <MyNameIsRasus> What about homie missiles?
[5:52:00] <MForan98> Ults can't get swapped
[5:52:07] <%TeethMuncher> @Goraka91 son of Shick Hyrdrobot
[5:52:13] <torontototoro> The UI is pretty meh. I don't even like Destiny, but its menus are more vibrant
[5:52:17] <Valdorick> … I should get in on the Daughters of Ash thing half a month late...
[5:52:21] <Goraka91> @TeethMuncher DUDE
[5:52:24] <+NiktenKing> You can use reticles and arcs
[5:52:31] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus and the vault is to the left at the base of the javelin platform and yes it ultimates classes
[5:52:32] <EASrake> rocket... punch?
[5:52:38] <OBS_VinnieK> yeah we can't swap Ults yet but it's coming in the future
[5:52:41] <%TeethMuncher> @Goraka91 visit my lore channel for more
[5:52:43] <MyNameIsRasus> D U N K
[5:52:44] <Goraka91> Also why is the interior a yucky cream colour
[5:52:47] <valriot> @torontototoro Destiny is a good game, just utterly defiled by Activision
[5:52:47] <+MagicBeanBurrito> ROCKETO PAAANCH
[5:52:49] <%Rezca> can he switch suit's yet?
[5:52:51] <+Soulriser3> is that eva 1
[5:53:00] <%QueequegTheater> @Valdorick Nah, you're not missing much besides "what if DS was hard because it's cheap bullshit instead of a fair yet steep learning curve?"
[5:53:06] <+VektorTroika> no, that's Woolieva unit 01
[5:53:07] <+Grayhammatter> what about rocket peace?
[5:53:12] <Valdorick> That sounds awful
[5:53:13] <dekkitout> does it have drills like getter robo?
[5:53:26] <valriot> gotta do a Burning Kick
[5:53:31] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus Is it wonderful though?
[5:53:32] <+Lixagon> super robot is wack, real robot or bust
[5:53:34] <+MagicBeanBurrito> do some S T O R Y
[5:53:36] <EASrake> yeah but that wasn't a rocket punch that's just a missle
[5:53:36] <+gwanzan> pronounced "rocketo paaaaaunch" at full shout
[5:53:38] <+krispen_wa> eww...story...
[5:53:38] <+Grayhammatter> red hot KICK
[5:53:43] <%QueequegTheater> @Valdorick IT IS
[5:53:46] <+gantz_zero> story is best for leveling up @WoolieVersus
[5:53:47] <arkv01> woolie you should eat something first
[5:53:49] <+MrIntake> i mean you can do the boss battle you dont really need to do the main quest
[5:53:50] <MyNameIsRasus> Do they serve rocket punch at Nasa parties?
[5:53:51] <%UrsulaCat> eat your burgers woolie
[5:53:53] <+NiktenKing> Do you know about Kojima and Venom Snake's ROKETTO PANCHI!
[5:53:57] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It'd be rad if we can get melee finishers in this game like cool animations for elite/boss enemies and do a super boosted suplex or something
[5:54:04] <+krispen_wa> Remember to eat your woolies, food
[5:54:05] <%QueequegTheater> BITS

[5:54:38] <Adriangabs> Well it's a good thing Videl had us covered with that
[5:54:38] <Louie_Salmon> @queequegtheater Well it's not made to be fair or balanced, it's meant to be bullshit for people that have played DS1 for a thousand hours
[5:54:39] <+VektorTroika> uh, six machine can do red hot kicks

[5:55:10] <Niney_Who> Anthem more like LULLABY
[5:55:12] <+VektorTroika> "GAWDS"
[5:55:13] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Speaking of amateur hour, did you figure out how to read bits?

[5:57:28] <Valdorick> Chain of Commands gives 0 shits about "just talk"
[5:57:29] <hntronium> The bad guys used ACCUSATION. It was super effective.
[5:57:29] <$KnivesEve> oh yeah did i miss ac7?
[5:57:31] <Adriangabs> A lot of video game plots can be resolved by "Just Talk"
[5:57:37] <%QueequegTheater> Wow that's a waste of money
[5:57:43] <Goraka91> @alrobot2014 PogChamp
[5:57:46] <dekkitout> i remember a friend of mine telling me about mangekeyou's while post chunin filler was on toonami

[5:57:51] <+Grayhammatter> flight stick for AC7? LUL
[5:57:53] <+MagicBeanBurrito> YES
[5:57:57] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah you did
[5:57:58] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The PSVR for AC7 is literally the best PSVR there is
[5:58:02] <Niney_Who> The uh.. the PC Version of AC7 is apparently a really bad port too
[5:58:05] <hntronium> PC Master Race tho
[5:58:05] <MechanicalBias> ...what is this dialogue. Are these guys supposed to be super awkward or something
[5:58:05] <+FxyDEV> why is jordan peele here

[5:58:09] <+mechslayer71> PAT LITERALLY FUCKING TOLD YOU WOOLIE
[5:58:11] <Louie_Salmon> The PC version also doesn't come with AC5
[5:58:13] <Valdorick> "Someone with a higher rank than you accused of being traitors!? Bandog, what should we do!?" "S O L I T A R Y BOYS!"
[5:58:15] <Halospaz117> Eh, if you are using a gamepad you should be good
[5:58:18] <Niney_Who> The PC doesn't come with 5 either

[5:58:46] <+Flambage> Who listens to Pat though
[5:58:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> CAUTION: there are no plans from Project Aces to implement more VR missions as of currently, all you have is all you get

[5:59:19] <Adriangabs> BIG BURNS
[5:59:21] <+LogothX> Ahh Freelahncah

[5:59:24] <valriot> Why is everyone bald????
[5:59:30] <kingdudeby> they
[5:59:30] <Valdorick> No guys, you don't get it, Pat told him to buy PC, but when we heard it in the pod cast, we were already the effects of [CRAZY TALK], and the audio was edited to "PS4"
[5:59:32] <+krispen_wa> because hair is hard
[5:59:33] <%ventus_fury> I Can't get into monster hunter
[5:59:33] <@mothmandraws> plot~

[6:00:15] <ShockedPachydurm> @valriot hair is expensive to model....its not like this is a Triple A game or anything
[6:00:15] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Section
[6:00:18] <@mothmandraws> they should just let you click to auto go to mech
[6:00:19] <Niney_Who> @Ariksgabs yes
[6:00:22] <+krispen_wa> @Ariksgabs yes
[6:00:27] <$RilsRislan> The conversation don't even do anything, and you can't sprint
[6:00:28] <+Lixagon> @Ariksgabs ya
[6:00:29] <Louie_Salmon> Heads Up Bisplay
[6:00:30] <+thecosmicfly> What's wrong with Astera err I mean Tarsis
[6:00:31] <EASrake> Yeah but what about the LIVING BREATHING WORLD
[6:00:33] <MechanicalBias> Why does this game think anything in it is cool besides piloting power armor?
[6:00:33] <%QueequegTheater> hey that's illegal
[6:00:34] <$RilsRislan> you can lightly job a little faster
[6:00:34] <+gwanzan> it is supposed to make you feel like a mortal piece of shit after playing Iron Man in the real game
[6:00:37] <hntronium> This sounds so boring
[6:00:39] <goroke> The final game will have a hub where you walk around in your Javelin
[6:00:39] <kingdudeby> It looks like the tower from Destiny 2 but poorly laid out and slow to move through.
[6:00:41] <pillowwasp> Video games!
[6:00:42] <%alrobot2014> the dialogue feels flat
[6:00:44] <torontototoro> The Citadel felt like a more lived in hub. this feels empty
[6:00:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Heads Up Bepis
[6:00:46] <+Grayhammatter> this uh... oof
[6:00:47] <hntronium> Are all the VA just phoning it in?
[6:00:47] <goroke> The fort is just for story, thankfully
[6:00:51] <Niney_Who> This doesn't look safe or comfortable
[6:00:52] <valriot> @electricelephantsonparade Especially coming off RE2 and KH3, which is BIG HAIR, this is embarassing
[6:00:54] <Adriangabs> Ooooooh ok thanks! I might end up getting the PS4 version anyway because of how Capcom handles PC ports
[6:00:56] <$RilsRislan> Also, notice your player character isn't anyone
[6:00:56] <+krispen_wa> This is the wiorst hub ever
[6:01:01] <%TeethMuncher> Does she not have a lock on her mech?
[6:01:06] <dekkitout> and people want pvp in this ResidentSleeper
[6:01:13] <pillowwasp> Does the videogame happen now?
[6:01:14] <$RilsRislan> Destiny at least had a CAC for your actual character
[6:01:18] <+phatmac16> Remember when you played bioware games to talk to ppl
[6:01:21] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah Leon's hair looks beautiful in that game
[6:01:21] <kingdudeby> I see woolie figured out the customization
[6:01:22] <twenty112> @hntronium I liked the bartender dialogue. Everyone else was pretty bland
[6:01:25] <+krispen_wa> remember when bioware
[6:01:26] <+Grayhammatter> it's... not good
[6:01:32] <Niney_Who> Remember when dialogue was good
[6:01:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The sound design could use some work, and by that I mean music need to exist as opposed to not lol
[6:01:40] <Niney_Who> Remember when there were attractive aliens to fuck?
[6:01:41] <viciousgrim> i like the game but not feeling getting it day one
[6:01:44] <+VektorTroika> And don't even THINK of upsetting me at my home!
[6:01:46] <Goraka91> Like Half Life 3
[6:01:49] <torontototoro> Remember when Bioware was Bioware? I member
[6:01:51] <%TeethMuncher> So Front Mission 3?
[6:01:52] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus I like story though...
[6:01:53] <%UrsulaCat> email plots make me snzzzz
[6:01:59] <Niney_Who> This is just worse Titanfall
[6:02:00] <+phatmac16> Remember Thane?
[6:02:02] <Valdorick> Remember Armored Core!? Or the giant mecha sim genre period!? Or the space dog fight sim!?…. I miss Freespace…...
[6:02:03] <%alrobot2014> @Reizie_Etherealm the music exists, it just got barely used in the last mission
[6:02:04] <Louie_Salmon> Music existing is like a tenfold improvement over not existing
[6:02:05] <kingdudeby> I think my favorite part is the mechs. They have nice weight.
[6:02:07] <%QueequegTheater> Remember Garrus
[6:02:09] <+krispen_wa> remember Tali's hips
[6:02:10] <dekkitout> Ordis: "Operator, you have 1 plot twist in your inbox."
[6:02:11] <Niney_Who> Exposition Dumps = bad
[6:02:16] <Goraka91> Garrus PepeHands
[6:02:18] <viciousgrim> if you open the map look for great falls canyon go and go to the the word falls for deep water @WoolieVersus
[6:02:18] <Adriangabs> At least add a Fast Travel to important NPCs
[6:02:21] <DestroPrime83> who the fuck reads anymore?
[6:02:22] <+gantz_zero> tell that to the matrix @Niney_Who
[6:02:23] <%alrobot2014> ii remember thane, and how they fuckin offed him in ME3
[6:02:27] <kingdudeby> But honestly we need more mech games. The tech is there, the future is mechs.
[6:02:27] <+Lixagon> LUL
[6:02:27] <%QueequegTheater> "Minh describes Stockhol Syndrome"
[6:02:28] <+phatmac16> Remember wrex
[6:02:29] <torontototoro> No We'll Bank k. in this game :(
[6:02:30] <Parapattern> @krispen_wa A fellow person of taste I see
[6:02:32] <MyNameIsRasus> Sounds like Woolie wants to play Acecombat
[6:02:35] <torontototoro> Bang*
[6:02:53] <%alrobot2014> Wrex... Shepard
[6:02:54] <$RilsRislan> I also wanted to get in and play
[6:02:57] <pillowwasp> Remember that rival pilot in titanfall 2. That was a good story
[6:02:57] <Niney_Who> vineSchut
[6:02:59] <+Grayhammatter> just play ace combat 4Head
[6:02:59] <DestroPrime83> not a single person here knows how to read
[6:03:00] <Goraka91> Remember Revan? (Actual Revan, not uh, that MMO one)
[6:03:01] <$RilsRislan> There's way too much fucking reading
[6:03:03] <%TRILLTURBAN> An email? Dear Main Character: please see attached documents for heartfelt betrayal. Sincerely Management.
[6:03:07] <$jackjumbo> cheer500 hi chat and wools . i got a question for you if you went through what Mathias went through(the body devision thing) in this game, whats the worst shenanigans you would do
[6:03:07] <Louie_Salmon> Instead of flying around with a dumb story, you should do different flying around with a different dumb story
[6:03:17] <$RilsRislan> There's all these popups
[6:03:17] <twenty112> Titanfall 2 in general was a good story
[6:03:21] <$RilsRislan> you gotta read
[6:03:25] <%QueequegTheater> @jackjumbo I would jerk myself off so much
[6:03:28] <dekkitout> man clone wars (cg show) wanted to do revan and bane FeelsBadMan
[6:03:28] <DestroPrime83> *pop
[6:03:35] <+VektorTroika> S.C.A.R.Ssss
[6:03:37] <+Lixagon> NO SHUT UP AND READ
[6:03:41] <pillowwasp> Titanfall 2 had a cooler robot
[6:03:44] <+Lixagon> NO FUN ONLY TEXT
[6:03:45] <%TeethMuncher> This is Bioware though? You gotta read
[6:03:46] <+MagicBeanBurrito> @jackjumbo have a threesome with me myself and I
[6:03:47] <Bruh_itsTC> read you coward
[6:03:47] <Adriangabs> DO YOUR HOMEWORK FIRST WOOLZ
[6:03:51] <Valdorick> A dumb story that takes itself just seriously enough to be endearing?
[6:03:53] <Thirtine> @jackjumbo sleep with myself LUL and get more time to do things
[6:03:53] <Goraka91> @dekkitout Star Wars and wasted potential, name a better duo FeelsBadMan
[6:03:54] <+Irridium> Titanfall 2 wasn't a grind shooter
[6:03:55] <+LogothX> Titanfall 2 had a cooler everything
[6:03:55] <$RilsRislan> That's not "accessibility"
[6:03:55] <+krispen_wa> i have no idea why disney still refuses to canonize the old republic era. Everyone loves it
[6:03:55] <+Reizie_Etherealm> So the formula for this game is hub, mission, hub, mission right? the tediousness of going back and forth can be minimized if the music and iconic sound effects make the experience more exciting
[6:03:56] <Adriangabs> Then you can do the Bang Bang
[6:03:56] <Shisno27> RELIABLE CHAT
[6:03:56] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Id just tell one of use to go to work LUL @jackjumbo
[6:03:58] <DestroPrime83> are enemies suppose to just poof like that?
[6:04:03] <EASrake> I would say its not the RIGHT attitude.
[6:04:05] <+krispen_wa> except TOR of course
[6:04:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Yo chat it's been fun, have to sleep, see ya guys later
[6:04:09] <%QueequegTheater> THAT'S CALLED STOCKHOLM SYNDROME
[6:04:12] <waifoong98> wanting to play the game is NOT WRONG Billy, it is right
[6:04:18] <Louie_Salmon> @jackjumbo Keep splitting and become a hivemind
[6:04:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Take Monster Hunter World for an example of hub, quest, hub, quest formula
[6:04:42] <torontototoro> fights are so fucking visually messy
[6:04:43] <waifoong98> @Reizie_Etherealm that or Armored Core
[6:04:44] <kingdudeby> I don't think its a bad game. Its just not there yet, and it comes out at the end of the month.
[6:04:53] <valriot> This looks like someone just made an Nvidia boxart into a game
[6:04:56] <$RilsRislan> Just trust them that they're only showing you
[6:04:59] <$RilsRislan> the bad verion
[6:05:01] <Valdorick> Warframe has even less hub.
[6:05:02] <Goraka91> For real though my eyes are being stabbed
[6:05:07] <pillowwasp> There are wizards on the moon
[6:05:10] <$RilsRislan> They keep telling us "This is a really old version"
[6:05:10] <EASrake> This is litetally how these types of games work. Start in hum take mission do mission back to hub take mission do mission
[6:05:12] <$jackjumbo> to answer my own question i would take louie's answer
[6:05:12] <+queaks> @is it not hard to judge until full release?
[6:05:12] <%TeethMuncher> @valriot oof
[6:05:14] <$RilsRislan> So why even show it to us.
[6:05:28] <%alrobot2014> why is this called a demo if its not representative of the final product
[6:05:29] <Goraka91> D: What
[6:05:29] <twenty112> BILLY PLS
[6:05:32] <Louie_Salmon> This is just the bad version, to get you all excited for the good version.
[6:05:33] <+Irridium> why would they show a really old version and say it's not a beta it's a demo
[6:05:34] <$jackjumbo> divide untill theres no more
[6:05:34] <+Grayhammatter> billy please
[6:05:41] <UnfilteredComic> D:
[6:05:44] <+queaks> Billy isnt that just japanese games?
[6:05:50] <pillowwasp> Monster hunter is to fight the monsters.
[6:05:51] <Adriangabs> to be fair I barely read any of the books in Witcher when I was playing it, which I know is a crime considering how deep it could go, I just wanna do the slashy slash
[6:06:01] <%UrsulaCat> I'm gonna. slep
[6:06:02] <+Aztec50> hmmm... this is giving me some insight into why i dont like games like skyrim and the witcher
[6:06:02] <%TeethMuncher> Monster Hunter has fuck tons of tutorials to be fair.
[6:06:13] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Monster Hunter is honestly hard without know how to play, even knowing its hard
[6:06:13] <Valdorick> Monster Hunter Is "What if every fight was a boss fight?" the game, and its amazing for it.
[6:06:16] <viciousgrim> its the games job to be fun a good tutorial like titanfall 2 vr training room would help
[6:06:16] <valriot> FFXIV and MH are both that, except some people get through who are still terrible and play "Ice Mages"
[6:06:21] <+thecosmicfly> @Reizie_Etherealm Astera's hub was a treat... until endgame. At that point it becomes a chore having to mash x to skip through NPC's dialogue just to even get to the menus
[6:06:30] <EASrake> It takes a certain willingness to LEARN a game tho. You can'tr get by just by wanting to SHOOT THE GUN
[6:06:32] <%QueequegTheater> WHEN KOTOR II THO
[6:06:32] <+yuiyui984> Fighting games then?
[6:06:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Some people prefer tutorial and some people prefer trial by fire and learn on the spot
[6:06:38] <Goraka91> To be fair everyone has preferences, but still D:
[6:06:58] <+daisyyyy> Does it feel like mass effect?
[6:06:59] <dekkitout> mhw is great- till i remember how much i hate stuns and a lack of super armor
[6:07:09] <Valdorick> @valriot I-is an "ice mage" what I think it is?... D-do people not do the mana loop!?
[6:07:09] <+krispen_wa> fuck tutorials: EVOLVE OR DIE
[6:07:14] <torontototoro> ah the good ol body on a pike schtick. even in future ironman land they do that still
[6:07:27] <twenty112> It super feels like Mass Effect
[6:07:29] <+gantz_zero> @xxviios kind of yeah. as far as abilities interact with each other
[6:07:33] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Maybe they should drop you into the world and tell you where to go, BUT you still get to travel and do what you want
[6:07:35] <Oncila> @Ariksgabs Same, I only read like 2 of the books. Loved them but I just wanted to play the game so i stopped reading
[6:07:39] <+daisyyyy> Im sold
[6:07:43] <Adriangabs> It might as well be Mass Effect MMO
[6:07:43] <pillowwasp> Remember the mechs in lost planet? Those were cooler than this too.
[6:07:52] <valriot> @valdorick Ive seen some SHIT in that game, like Level 70 BLMs who just go "Fire 3 Fire 3 Bliz 1" repeat
[6:07:58] <+KeroScene> So woolie hates dark souls
[6:07:59] <Goraka91> 13 DansGame
[6:08:04] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @thecosmicfly That's the curse of the hub, quest, hub, quest formula. There are too many unnecessary steps in between the fun parts of the game
[6:08:07] <Louie_Salmon> @valdorick "I like the ice magic. I played an ice mage in WoW, so I'm glad I can still do that here."
[6:08:07] <%alrobot2014> yay music that came in for a second
[6:08:08] <Adriangabs> @Oncila glad I'm not alone on that part XD
[6:08:18] <+daisyyyy> I cant afford it but im sold lol
[6:08:24] <+MagicBeanBurrito> L O A D I N G T I M E
[6:08:36] <torontototoro> has there been a game with bio-organic 'mechs' yet? like a shapeshifting suit
[6:08:37] <JooseNeck> All you have to do in 13 is auto battle and paradigm shift
[6:08:54] <pirateofpie> So wait, is this put already?
[6:08:58] <pirateofpie> *out
[6:08:59] <valriot> @torontototoro Warframe lmfao
[6:09:00] <%alrobot2014> demo
[6:09:05] <%QueequegTheater> touch the shiny
[6:09:14] <Valdorick> I suddenly understand why during my 2 months playing FF14 I would get commendations as a Blackmage. My friend who bought me the gift was so confused, because he had never seen that.
[6:09:21] <twenty112> So Woolie hasn't done the Stronghold yet, eh?
[6:09:23] <dekkitout> @torontototoro warframe kinds has that, but spoilers...
[6:09:28] <%TeethMuncher> The Souls games didn't have really have crafting and the like though
[6:09:31] <Adriangabs> Warframe has bio-organic "mechs" but none of them transform
[6:09:32] <torontototoro> @valriot yeah duh true haha. can't think of any singleplayer games though
[6:09:42] <Adriangabs> except for Equinox I think
[6:09:44] <+gantz_zero> @TwentyCXII there's no chance he will. just a heads up
[6:09:46] <+VektorTroika> @torontototoro Altered Echo
[6:09:51] <%QueequegTheater> FO4 had the best crafting in the series, change my mind
[6:09:52] <dekkitout> chroma and equinox transform
[6:09:53] <Fabric_tester> And Chroma
[6:10:05] <+krispen_wa> Crafting in any series is a mistake
[6:10:07] <+RushUnplugged> Nidus
[6:10:08] <Adriangabs> oh yeah I forgot about Chroma
[6:10:16] <EASrake> @QueequegTheater Spam shelves to level up ez game
[6:10:19] <Louie_Salmon> @torontototoro I mean, metroid, but that's a suit not a mech
[6:10:22] <torontototoro> @VektorTroika wow that's a deep pull
[6:10:22] <dekkitout> warframe could use more henshin
[6:10:22] <valriot> @valdorick Yeah no its eye opening how many people dont look at their own Job skills in that game and dont even put 2 and 2 together and go "oh i can use this after this" ect
[6:10:29] <Goraka91> Nidus transforms visually but I think they mean more like, actual transformation like that dude from Protoype
[6:10:38] <+MrIntake> LULW
[6:10:42] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[6:10:44] <+VektorTroika> @torontototoro ya'll know what a dais is?
[6:10:49] <%fatal_penguin_> Crafting in fo4 just didn't feel good
[6:10:51] <torontototoro> no clue haha.
[6:10:55] <Adriangabs> Ash with the deluxe skin is kinda sentai-ish
[6:10:57] <UnfilteredComic> Melee isbetteron the other classes
[6:10:58] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I fall off JRPG games so often because of the pages upon pages of explanation and tutorials before I can get into the actual game
[6:11:00] <+VektorTroika> oh lol, it's one of the first lines in the game
[6:11:08] <Adriangabs> it's also my favorite WF Skin
[6:11:13] <pillowwasp> The mechs in EDF are better than these
[6:11:21] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie should play Spec Ops: The Line instead
[6:11:33] <+SuichiTanaka> Khora modifes her spikes visually to match her kitty mode
[6:11:33] <EASrake> Colossus has a huge ground slam
[6:11:57] <+VektorTroika> Injustice ascends from below
[6:11:57] <+MagicBeanBurrito> glowy boys
[6:12:05] <%QueequegTheater> Oh man these enemy design are PAINFULLY 7/10s
[6:12:08] <dekkitout> oh yeah- mirage kinda henshins
[6:12:15] <Adriangabs> how hard is it to get Khora?
[6:12:17] <viciousgrim> love that they gave the copy of that guy a new name
[6:12:19] <pillowwasp> Look at this sci fi
[6:12:30] <dekkitout> about as hard as ivara
[6:12:37] <Adriangabs> Damn
[6:12:39] <+SuichiTanaka> Decently difficult. It's an 8% drop from Sanctuary Onslaught
[6:12:44] <$Chumblago13> This game is surpisingly fun
[6:12:56] <Louie_Salmon> @reizie_etherealm I think a wall/multiple walls of text are sometimes necessarily. We're a long way past jump and shoot being the only buttons
[6:13:00] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Are you and Pat planning an AC7 LP for your channel?
[6:13:03] <Goraka91> Cubes with greebles NOW we're Sci-fi PogChamp
[6:13:05] <+SuichiTanaka> But Sanct On is good for leveling too, so you can grind MR while you farm Khora
[6:13:09] <%QueequegTheater> I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS
[6:13:14] <kingdudeby> Theres good in there. It can be a good game. But its gonna be rough at launch. Thanks EA
[6:13:25] <Fabric_tester> It's easier to grind the market to get Ivara
[6:13:30] <%QueequegTheater> Oryx is that you
[6:13:31] <+ShitpostGaming> So how is loading menu the game woolie?
[6:13:39] <Adriangabs> Yeah I should probably do more Onslaught huh
[6:13:47] <+SuichiTanaka> Now that Mesa has a prime, it's easier to get Mesa Prime
[6:13:51] <dekkitout> good focus farm too
[6:13:52] <superbla25> It is pretty hilarious that a chunk of chat just shifted to Warframe.
[6:13:58] <valriot> Look at these DC movie enemies
[6:14:01] <+gantz_zero> shoot arms @WoolieVersus
[6:14:11] <pillowwasp> You know what I want my robot to do? Hold a gun...
[6:14:11] <Goraka91> Everyone plays Warframe. Everyone.
[6:14:14] <+thecosmicfly> Speaking of loading times, anyone else blown away by how damn quick it is to load up levels in Dreams? Shit is instant ramen
[6:14:16] <torontototoro> @valriot so like generic bad CG?
[6:14:25] <dekkitout> we ALL lift together tajWUT
[6:14:25] <valriot> @torontototoro yes
[6:14:26] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @Louie_Salmon I understand that, I don't mean to complain or voice my frustration. I'm just saying things as they are, cause that kind of tutorial and explanation is pretty essential for the JRPG genre
[6:14:29] <Fabric_tester> Also Ivara has more utility that Khora
[6:14:30] <%QueequegTheater> Mr. X could kick these guys' asses
[6:14:33] <pillowwasp> Why isn’t the gun shoulder mounted
[6:14:47] <+VektorTroika> cuz shooty shoot bang bangs
[6:14:58] <+SuichiTanaka> Warframe is free, constantly adds new content every few months, and is easy to drop in and out of. Makes for a game that's easy to backburner for tons of people
[6:15:02] <Goraka91> I love how Mr X is like...a thing now
[6:15:06] <%QueequegTheater> That's literally just a Halo bubble shield
[6:15:09] <Adriangabs> I deperately need Ivara because killing critters for a Riven is THE WORST
[6:15:18] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus combos
[6:15:18] <UnfilteredComic> @pillowwasp Cant aim something on your shoulder i guess?
[6:15:23] <+gantz_zero> shoot his arms @WoolieVersus
[6:15:28] <valriot> Gotta say, ita impressive that an automated machine created a game like this
[6:15:30] <Louie_Salmon> *stomp* *stomp* *stomp*
[6:15:31] <+VektorTroika> It's more like Winston's shield cuz allies can shoot out of it
[6:15:32] <twenty112> Colossus has shoulder and arm mounted shizz
[6:15:34] <dekkitout> i just divebomb em as zephyr like a peregrine
[6:15:35] <%QueequegTheater> flying is just hovering fast
[6:15:51] <+VektorTroika> or Frost's snowglobe
[6:15:53] <+Reizie_Etherealm> That's why it should be the same button, I think
[6:16:05] <king_trito> the only thing i hope they have in this is a self heal ability.
[6:16:07] <pillowwasp> @unfilteredcomic I think it’s more about looking like a halo/destiny
[6:16:10] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Fly and hover should be the same button
[6:16:14] <+VektorTroika> YEAH JERRA'S WRATH
[6:16:20] <kingdudeby> Not everyone who worked on this game was an automated machine. Robots would likely finish the game faster.
[6:16:20] <Fabric_tester> Ivara is good to get headshoots without being affected by procs
[6:16:30] <Goraka91> Speaking of generic Sci-fi, GOD I hate 343 Halo's designs so much
[6:16:34] <$KnivesEve> @WoolieVersus btw that jojo the 7 stand user game is pretty fun since i started playing it. cheer50
[6:16:35] <+VektorTroika> they'd also leave less bugs in the beta
[6:16:43] <%QueequegTheater> drop your shield
[6:16:46] <+zanzibar_junker> How's anthem workin for woolie?
[6:16:50] <Adriangabs> To be fair, Warframe started as a trash fire when it came out, I quit and then returned after Eidolon + recommendation from Plague and Pat, this one had the potential from the get to but unfortunately it looks like it gonna fall before it could fly
[6:16:53] <%fatal_penguin_> Use your demon summons Woolie
[6:17:02] <+zanzibar_junker> Also evenin chat
[6:17:03] <+SuichiTanaka> yeah, early Warframe was NOT good.
[6:17:06] <pillowwasp> The new halo man is way overdesigned
[6:17:16] <+VektorTroika> that's alotta DAMAGE.
[6:17:17] <+krispen_wa> this game would be better if it was more distinctive instead of being generic sci fi armor game
[6:17:21] <+VektorTroika> I just sawed this boss in half
[6:17:25] <+gantz_zero> those big guys' hands are weak points @WoolieVersus
[6:17:25] <goroke> LOADDDDD
[6:17:30] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie just play Spec Ops: The Line
[6:17:31] <dekkitout> alot of these kinds of games have a shounen timeskip like improvement
[6:17:31] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Like if they made it so that you press on stick for flying and hovering, and make it so that the amount you push the stick controls if you hover or fly at full speed, that'd be more intuitive I think
[6:17:41] <+somerandom9uy01> damn masterchief really got an upgrade
[6:17:44] <+SuichiTanaka> Nothing in Anthem is very distinctive. All the humanoid enemies have no unique silhoettes.
[6:17:53] <+zanzibar_junker> Grank boss
[6:18:00] <+SuichiTanaka> All the Javelins look the same, aside from the big guy
[6:18:17] <twenty112> But one of them has a CAPE
[6:18:20] <kingdudeby> The enemy designs are very indistinct.
[6:18:21] <+Ecchigun> how is the game so far
[6:18:22] <+SuichiTanaka> and all the sounds of the gunfire are so limp
[6:18:27] <%QueequegTheater> Look at this underlevelled nooblet
[6:18:30] <+MagicBeanBurrito> so many triangles
[6:18:36] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus Jump in free play and do a little mish
[6:18:39] <+redmongoose6> twenty lmao
[6:18:40] <pillowwasp> Should these even be called mechs? I think they are powersuits
[6:18:43] <Adriangabs> The Infested looks a lot more interesting than these Zerg-like wildlife, and Infested are super generic alien zombo things
[6:18:47] <valriot> is Woolie playing Titan, Hunter or Warlock?
[6:18:48] <%TeethMuncher> @Ecchigun mixed
[6:18:50] <kingdudeby> The mechs are nice looking, but the enemies could have been recycled mass effect fodder for all it matters.
[6:18:53] <king_trito> one is more sleeker and feminine, ones a literal bulldozer, and one is a mage like with a cape.
[6:18:54] <Goraka91> Powered armour
[6:19:06] <Shisno27> @pillowwasp Shhhhhh chat needs to complain

[6:21:13] <EASrake> alright let's watch the cutscene freeze everybody
[6:21:14] <+gwanzan> this is on purpose
[6:21:15] <hntronium> SOOOOO SLOWWWWWW
[6:21:19] <%TeethMuncher> What if Woolie hits lvl 12 and it resets to 10?
[6:21:21] <+SuichiTanaka> I'm sorta sad nobody played Firefall, cause this game is just that, with some power suits.
[6:21:23] <+Lixagon> wow that is a long fucking walk
[6:21:24] <hntronium> What is bullet jumping?
[6:21:26] <+Ecchigun> BUGGED
[6:21:26] <sporktown_heroine> This place just seems empty and barren too

[6:22:50] <waifoong98> Nothing happens, just like Andromeda LUL
[6:22:50] <Adriangabs> They slammed the thing again and then all 3 of them will stay permanently
[6:22:57] <go4thekneez> why even play it if you are just going to shit on it the whole time?
[6:23:01] <goroke> "air tastes like purple" Nice writing Bio
[6:23:05] <%Rezca> wait... so they dont fuse back?
[6:23:05] <RockReligion> With everything coming out, this game doesn’t even break top ten.
[6:23:08] <Goraka91> Tuvix was a living person FeelsBadMan
[6:23:11] <+Ecchigun> fun fun fun fun fun fun
[6:23:13] <+Irridium> that cutscene bugged out on the PC and they were frozen in time while dialogue happened
[6:23:17] <+Grayhammatter> fun stuff
[6:23:20] <MangoCoal> Whoa! This stream just keeps on going!
[6:23:20] <zamzoph> oh, so it's a bit that lasts forever

[6:23:29] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> LUL
[6:23:31] <+VektorTroika> instead of writing one three dimensional character, go through BIG FILLERS to make three two dimensional ones!
[6:23:38] <Goraka91> IMMERSION
[6:23:41] <goroke> This area is just for the story, Woolie
[6:23:47] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus dont even bother with forge just launch
[6:23:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> "Reality can be altered, but it cannot change" "Wait, wha-"
[6:23:50] <%QueequegTheater> DINKLEBOT WAS AT LEAST ENTERTAINING
[6:23:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Seems like the game gets in its own way a lot
[6:23:53] <goroke> They have a separate Hub where you get to walk around in your Javelin
[6:23:55] <kingdudeby> because its all locked for the demo. This is a DEMO not the full game this is not available in the DEMO
[6:23:57] <NeedlesD> but how will you have IMMERSION, Woolie
[6:23:57] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus it a big loading screen
[6:23:58] <+gantz_zero> the voice actors truly tried @WoolieVersus
[6:24:02] <MForan98> but "Muh RPG elements" Woolie!
[6:24:04] <pillowwasp> Wizards on the moon Woolie
[6:24:09] <Adriangabs> Thanos: "Realty can be whatever I want"
[6:24:12] <BlacSoul> Oh no, it’s, THE HIVE
[6:24:13] <+krispen_wa> oh no it's the hiiive
[6:24:13] <%QueequegTheater> same character
[6:24:19] <goroke> Same Character
[6:24:19] <+thecosmicfly> But woolie how are you going to feel the emotions when the hub area is being invaded or on fire or some shit
[6:24:20] <%alrobot2014> ITS THE SAME CHARACTER
[6:24:23] <dekkitout> its the same, nothing lore wise happened
[6:24:24] <waifoong98> LUL
[6:24:26] <+gantz_zero> same character, he got overwritten @WoolieVersus
[6:24:26] <NeedlesD> and Nolan North did so much of a better job
[6:24:28] <Goraka91> They even replaced the old lines
[6:24:30] <%alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus they patched out the dinklage
[6:24:33] <+Grayhammatter> same character, different VA LUL
[6:24:34] <blackbookalpha> at least its not GACKT from the Final Fantasy series
[6:24:41] <valriot> Nolan does a good job anyway
[6:24:45] <+FrostedZaibatsu> *Moved voice files to recycling bin*
[6:24:57] <%QueequegTheater> Nolan North did a better VA job but I prefer Dinklebot's personality
[6:25:00] <%alrobot2014> gackt is the reason we won't get crisis core :(
[6:25:01] <+ChrisAlgoo> the gun is called warden! like in the dragon age!
[6:25:04] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus look for the devastator
[6:25:17] <king_trito> USE THE DEVASTATOR
[6:25:17] <Adriangabs> "We've woken the Hiiiive"
[6:25:20] <dekkitout> all that time i thought dry dinklebot was intended
[6:25:21] <EASrake> Machine Pistol?
[6:25:26] <kingdudeby> if you need a voice actor just get Nolan North. Don't bother holding auditions, just get Nolan North, he voices everything.
[6:25:28] <Goraka91> I mean North is a professional VA, Dinklage...isn't
[6:25:29] <king_trito> NOOOOOOO
[6:25:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> "Are you sure you want to permanently delete these 99 items?"
[6:25:32] <valriot> get The Last Word
[6:25:35] <pillowwasp> Robots shouldn’t hold guns. They should have guns mounted on them
[6:25:37] <Adriangabs> I kinda miss Dinklebot :(
[6:25:37] <twenty112> yeyeyeye
[6:25:41] <+phatmac16> I CLAPPED
[6:25:45] <%QueequegTheater> Use the Black Spindle
[6:25:46] <Pokemanics> So does the gameplay of Anthem look decent?
[6:25:54] <+SuichiTanaka> It's a 5/10
[6:25:56] <Goraka91> Speaking of VA is there anyhting Dee Bradley Baker can't do? PogChamp
[6:25:56] <+phatmac16> No
[6:26:02] <king_trito> YESSSSSSS
[6:26:11] <valriot> Tractor Cannon, lets go Kappa
[6:26:14] <kingdudeby> But then you have to completely uninstall the weapon to put on a new one. Robots should have hands and hold their weapons.
[6:26:17] <torontototoro> these gun selection menus are so ugly. are you able to change them?
[6:26:20] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Gameplay is okay but they need to add a why to get health back
[6:26:21] <%TeethMuncher> @Pokemanics it's disorientating and lacks feedback, but it works and could be good with refinement
[6:26:22] <MangoCoal> Is he...using the EVA Unit-01 color scheme?
[6:26:22] <king_trito> devastator is a literal Cannon
[6:26:26] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how are the jet packs going? :3
[6:26:36] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus use when hovering
[6:26:39] <DatAsuna> The question: which will win out, his need to customize or dinner?
[6:26:41] <dekkitout> riskrunner is where the real orb machine is
[6:26:44] <Fabric_tester> they overheat
[6:26:47] <+gantz_zero> i love the movement @dan_g_v
[6:26:48] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus if you open the map look for great falls canyon go and go to the the word falls for deep water
[6:26:54] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I wanna see the new suit type so badly, I'm so done with the default
[6:26:56] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus start from the fort for waterfall
[6:26:59] <twenty112> Devastator is pretty much the only gun that feels impactful
[6:27:01] <pillowwasp> @kingdudeby if you made it right, you could change weapons without leaving the suit
[6:27:05] <king_trito> unbiased opinion: Gameplay is fun, netcode needs a lil reworking, could last if they do community events/weekly & daily challenges.
[6:27:23] <DatAsuna> Long loads is the console tax
[6:27:27] <+SuichiTanaka> I feel like the enemies are just a bit too bullet spongy.
[6:27:27] <valriot> @dekkitout This unironically makes me wanna play Destiny again, but im back in FFXIV so fuk
[6:27:32] <torontototoro> !uptime
[6:27:32] <+MrIntake> HUGE STREAM
[6:27:40] <%QueequegTheater> Minh what the fuck
[6:27:41] <+gantz_zero> no god @WoolieVersus
[6:27:46] <Adriangabs> I already like this better than Destiny because 3rd person, but it needs to show more polish
[6:27:47] <torontototoro> no uptime command? odd
[6:27:49] <dan_g_v> not loading, this is self ddos, right?
[6:27:52] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Loads are long on pc too
[6:27:54] <+Grayhammatter> wow, billy with the huge streams
[6:27:59] <+Goliz> This game seem very unremarkable. There's nothing great about it and some lame stuff, feels like a game you'd play because you have nothing else.
[6:28:01] <+MagicBeanBurrito> 25 coin
[6:28:01] <+thecosmicfly> 8 hours a week or a DAY?
[6:28:04] <Monkeyweed21> This unironically makes me want to play ff14
[6:28:06] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie you could play Darkest Dungeon
[6:28:07] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Gameplay is decent, it has substance but the game could be improved to have more flavor so that we can enjoy consuming this food rather than just ingesting it
[6:28:16] <waifoong98> Git gud Woolie, German Spy Stream 7hr on average Kappa
[6:28:25] <DatAsuna> put a skeleton on camera
[6:28:27] <+Grayhammatter> ff14 shadowbringers Kreygasm

[6:28:31] <hntronium> punchmom slep
[6:28:32] <$KnivesEve> just be looking at the game right now. to me it looks... safe
[6:28:37] <valriot> @ariksgabs Admittedly, 3rd person is something i hope they add to Destiny 3
[6:28:38] <+krispen_wa> "hanging in there"
[6:28:40] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus waterfall and deep water right in ront of you
[6:28:43] <zamzoph> hanging in here ResidentSleeper
[6:28:46] <torontototoro> @WoolieVersus y u no have !uptime command?
[6:28:48] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus if you open the map look for great falls canyon go and go to the the word falls for deep water and ues the devastator when hovering
[6:28:49] <PP_Willpower> wassup @WoolieVersus
[6:28:52] <Soulsbjorne> HA 001cler
[6:28:52] <Shisno27> you can use your abilities more consistently in this than warframe and destiny, and for that, it is more fun.
[6:28:55] <Goraka91> Destiny 3 yeah good luck with that LUL
[6:29:08] <+ChrisAlgoo> I mean the Iron Man shit looks fun
[6:29:11] <+Lixagon> LUL
[6:29:11] <+MrIntake> fly around till you see public events
[6:29:11] <dekkitout> thing about 3rd person in destiny is that some guns wont feel the same -last word-

[6:29:22] <+Lixagon> LUL
[6:29:36] <Adriangabs> or make 3rd person an option, like Elder Scrolls or something
[6:29:39] <%Rezca> so... where is the oxygen supply?
[6:29:44] <king_trito> follow the lights
[6:29:46] <+krispen_wa> sting rays, the being strong enough to defeat steve irwin
[6:29:56] <Goraka91> How do the thrusters work underwater
[6:30:01] <Adriangabs> it feels better in first person, but if you really want to play 3rd person that option is there for you
[6:30:04] <+Reizie_Etherealm> *Insert Archwing vietnam flashbacks here
[6:30:07] <waifoong98> Billy.exe has stopped working Kappa
[6:30:07] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[6:30:09] <valriot> 3rd and 1 stperson swapping could work, chaotic, but who cares
[6:30:12] <+Grayhammatter> that's fucked
[6:30:12] <%QueequegTheater> @Goraka91 Same way they work in air

[6:30:28] <%QueequegTheater> gasses and liquids work under the same thermodynamic principles
[6:30:29] <hntronium> What a shitty suit
[6:30:29] <DatAsuna> I want a comic of Woolie diveboarding into puddles
[6:30:37] <Goraka91> @QueequegTheater Space magic?

[6:30:40] <lbrownthedestroyer> Oh its warmachine nevermind
[6:30:52] <%QueequegTheater> @Goraka91 No, thermodynamics
[6:31:07] <+MrIntake> pull a map and theres mini stronghold you can go to for xp or find random public events @WoolieVersus
[6:31:07] <dekkitout> space magic, gotcha
[6:31:10] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The Well
[6:31:12] <ScreamLord> I wish flying felt faster
[6:31:12] <%QueequegTheater> *fluid thermodynamics
[6:31:14] <+queaks> the wall lol
[6:31:15] <ribbot1> them's eva colors
[6:31:19] <Shisno27> think that says well but y'know whatever
[6:31:21] <StarvingPenguinGod> you can't mark way points BibleThump
[6:31:24] <+Ecchigun> flying feel slow
[6:31:33] <Goraka91> I'll admit no idea how that works LUL
[6:31:37] <hntronium> A wall? THE WALL?
[6:31:39] <Adriangabs> oh so the overheat meter goes down if you're diveboming
[6:31:42] <ScreamLord> As of now it's barely better than Sprinting
[6:31:43] <dekkitout> tl;dr air is a fluid
[6:31:46] <+krispen_wa> THAT's THE WALL BROTHER
[6:31:55] <king_trito> of course Woolie is using the Uzi Kappa
[6:31:56] <%QueequegTheater> Oh my god they're little Pat'sized enemies
[6:31:58] <+DeadPhoenix3> he been using the ranger the whole time?
[6:32:06] <Valdorick> all this gas makes a fluid, all this gas makes a fluid.
[6:32:07] <Goraka91> THEY ARE LUL
[6:32:11] <+psychocalibur> are you winning, son?
[6:32:23] <+Goliz> Can you upgrade the overheating thing?
[6:32:26] <+FrostedZaibatsu> That pistol is good
[6:32:29] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I prefer bangs over pews
[6:32:35] <twenty112> To be fair, your suit has like 2ft stilts
[6:32:37] <viciousgrim> world events show up as purple way points
[6:33:32] <Adriangabs> it's no Web Swinging, but hey it's better than horse riding in RDR
[6:33:44] <ribbot1> pilot the eva woolie, or pat will have to do it again
[6:33:44] <%maskedriderhero> I just realized, does this game not have a mini map?
[6:33:54] <+Irridium> @goliz yeah but not much in the demo
[6:33:58] <+gantz_zero> it has a compass @maskedriderhero
[6:33:59] <king_trito> @maskedriderhero nope, just a compass
[6:34:04] <%maskedriderhero> uwaa
[6:34:08] <dekkitout> no, but i know a lower left corner that can sure use a mini map
[6:34:16] <Adriangabs> ^
[6:34:17] <+Reizie_Etherealm> uwaaaah~
[6:34:19] <+ChrisAlgoo> "Harvest Parts" who writes this stuff
[6:34:25] <king_trito> its better wtihout a minimap. it encourages exploration
[6:34:30] <Xiangchang> This new Monster Hunter World expansion looks pretty crazy.
[6:34:38] <+Reizie_Etherealm> No minimap? That's heresy
[6:34:59] <%maskedriderhero> Did they release a trailer for Iceborne?
[6:35:22] <%QueequegTheater> "See that mountain?"
[6:35:23] <Adriangabs> not sure if they released a second trailer
[6:35:24] <dekkitout> define trailer
[6:35:26] <%QueequegTheater> "DON'T GO THERE"
[6:35:29] <+krispen_wa> is that the irithyll expansion to bloodborne?
[6:35:30] <valriot> This game cant compete with Viera queens in YoRHa outfits anyway
[6:35:42] <king_trito> @Reizie_Etherealm Ha, need a minimap? pathetic Kappa
[6:35:45] <+MagicBeanBurrito> +50 XP to a badge
[6:35:45] <+DeadPhoenix3> you gotta exit the level to cash out xp
[6:35:50] <%QueequegTheater> Sharkgirls > bunnygirls

[6:36:56] <%TeethMuncher> @QueequegTheater mothgirls > sharkgirls > bunny girls
[6:36:58] <Adriangabs> could've sworn I reached level 12 just by doing the story missions
[6:37:00] <king_trito> all i want is to make Black Manta in this game, a big ol head is all i need
[6:37:06] <+gantz_zero> free roam mission/event/whatever for exp @WoolieVersus is what i'm trying to say

[6:39:01] <+thecosmicfly> Man you murder nature good in this game huh
[6:39:09] <Shisno27> if there are sharkboys and lavagirls there mst surely be lavaboys and sharkgirls
[6:39:10] <%TeethMuncher> @dekkitout signing up for netflix...now
[6:39:11] <Adriangabs> so are sharkgirls just lolis with a shark fin on their back?
[6:39:18] <%QueequegTheater> @Reizie_Etherealm Human bodies and hair with shark skin and tails
[6:39:22] <king_trito> I prefer snakegirls Keepo
[6:39:28] <dekkitout> start at movie 2/3 TPFufun
[6:39:37] <Goraka91> Snek
[6:39:46] <+MrIntake> just fly around and youll find enough xp

[6:39:54] <Valdorick> Guys guys guys, can't we all just agree that best girl is changeling girl? They can be ANYTHING.
[6:40:00] <ribbot1> those are just lotus seeds
[6:40:05] <+VektorTroika> trypophobia nest
[6:40:13] <%QueequegTheater> @Valdorick Only if they choose to be sharkgirls
[6:40:16] <Ragnorok64> What is Mihn's first language?
[6:40:26] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @QueequegTheater So kinda like Zora from Zelda?
[6:40:32] <DatAsuna> use dat ult for the challenge
[6:40:40] <Adriangabs> Minh was reading chat
[6:40:41] <%Rezca> Triple Language Minh
[6:40:45] <dekkitout> im not allocating brain space to the mouthful title that is simply netflix godzilla movie 2 of 3
[6:40:45] <Ragnorok64> Thanks
[6:41:01] <3Xgilly> try thr sniper
[6:41:05] <3Xgilly> the
[6:41:14] <sporktown_heroine> This game isn't exactly what I'd hoped
[6:41:17] <king_trito> netlix godzilla is trash.
[6:41:22] <sporktown_heroine> I was hoping closer to Monster Hunter or something
[6:41:25] <agadejobi> But if we're talking monster girls, then I'm down with lamia
[6:41:31] <CrimsonCore90> Was that the 5th element gun?
[6:41:32] <+thecosmicfly> At least it isn't Godzilla 358/2 Days
[6:41:44] <+VektorTroika> A Fragmentary Passage
[6:41:47] <Valdorick> Mina body pillow best body pillow.... uuuuuuh… SO I'VE HEARD
[6:41:55] <+MagicBeanBurrito> F
[6:41:56] <Goraka91> What's the deal with Kingdom Hearts titles anyway
[6:42:02] <ScreamLord> Man we need a good semi-open world Godzilla game
[6:42:04] <ribbot1> 50 dkp minus
[6:42:10] <+thecosmicfly> Cocaine
[6:42:15] <Adriangabs> It's up there with Touhou titles
[6:42:17] <valriot> reconnect. Godzilla
[6:42:18] <king_trito> use the devastor, wools man
[6:42:19] <+thecosmicfly> Cocaine is what's the deal with KH titles
[6:42:32] <+VektorTroika> KH titles are references to internet media that Nomura likes
[6:42:35] <Valdorick> Kingdom Heart Server Spoilers Service
[6:42:45] <%TeethMuncher> @Goraka91 all you need to know is that Mickey kept his shirt off to maintain plot integrity
[6:42:51] <dekkitout> xolldogaz had a really doos heel turn in chain of memories
[6:43:01] <+ChrisAlgoo> but woolie, you love vergil
[6:43:05] <ValentineHearts> KHs titles always felt like lazy translation to me but its too big for that to make sense.
[6:43:07] <FruitBasketVidya> I JUST BEAT KH3
[6:43:08] <goroke> Sniper Rifle is better in a PvE environment
[6:43:09] <UnfilteredComic> Sipers are not good
[6:43:10] <Baeltyr> i hate the vision cutoff you get with sniper rifles
[6:43:18] <+VektorTroika> Please tell me Foygoox is canon
[6:43:21] <Adriangabs> LUL
[6:43:22] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus big damage
[6:43:22] <+thecosmicfly> Dream Drop Distance literally being three D's as an acronym is definitely something thought up by someone doing a rail
[6:43:27] <%thechungiestofbois> shoot the fetus vergil
[6:43:29] <ScreamLord> Snipers are kinda clunky in this game
[6:43:33] <%QueequegTheater> Guys, Woolie is a babby at shooters, of course he likes the basic stuff right now
[6:43:33] <%Rezca> DMC Vergil
[6:43:35] <FruitBasketVidya> DEDEDE
[6:43:37] <valriot> Mickey: "My nips are so hard in this darkness, Riku. Oh-o!"
[6:43:37] <+RushUnplugged> SNIPE ABORTION VERGIL
[6:43:38] <Adriangabs> He Devastated that fetus that's for sure
[6:43:39] <ArgentUndaCova> Kill the baby Vergil mopHypers
[6:43:39] <goroke> DmC Vergil
[6:43:41] <goroke> LOL
[6:43:45] <Goraka91> Explode that fetus
[6:43:48] <SGrim> Last complete SPF lp was DmC... BibleThump

[6:44:27] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Iron Man
[6:44:29] <olm46> Sniper rifles get a damage buff against demons of certain ages in Vergil's hands.
[6:44:30] <DatAsuna> spark beam is iron man
[6:44:36] <stormfang24> Kill the baby Vergil
[6:44:36] <FruitBasketVidya> luckily there are no more norts or sora in the new game
[6:44:39] <3Xgilly> Snipers (at least from playing destiny) helps with dealing large amounts of damage to bosses
[6:44:40] <ScreamLord> So whatcha gonna unlock? Storm, Colossus or Interceptor?
[6:44:41] <DatAsuna> there's 2 lasers
[6:44:45] <DatAsuna> continuous and charge
[6:44:48] <+gantz_zero> did you actually forget DmC Virgil shot a baby with a sniper @WoolieVersus
[6:44:55] <jibleysoseph> by the end of the game it's 0 to 0
[6:44:56] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus like 8k to stronghold boss pershot

[6:48:00] <olm46> Woolie has wiped the memory of Vergil using a sniper from his mind to protect himself.
[6:48:02] <+MrIntake> on the map there are places you can go to to kill a bunch of enemies it has a icon @WoolieVersus

[6:48:13] <+nycwally> They said that free play doesn't give xp in demo, feelsbad,man
[6:48:13] <Valdorick> I see now. Food is to Woolie, what "one more match" is to Pat.
[6:48:18] <dan_g_v> you know, Woolie could go to the kitchen and make himself 3 sandwiches in the time it takes to load
[6:48:21] <%QueequegTheater> WOOLIE
[6:48:27] <%QueequegTheater> FREEPLAY GIVES NO XP

[6:49:44] <Valdorick> Facts - Eating food in real life is an XP buff in your video games, because you play better when your brain isn't eating itself Kappa
[6:49:45] <DatAsuna> There's a lot of contradictory and conflicting info in chat today

[6:51:08] <CrimsonCore90> Mukbang?
[6:51:09] <%TeethMuncher> Just eat, Woolie
[6:51:12] <dan_g_v> Turn this into a eating stream!
[6:51:15] <Adriangabs> Chat is concerned for your well being Woolie <3
[6:51:20] <%QueequegTheater> FYRE FEST 2 BEGIN NOW
[6:51:20] <+phatmac16> Ok
[6:51:22] <dekkitout> is dying worth a new suit that wont be tight?
[6:51:26] <lemon_lore> eat at this time why not just sleep
[6:51:30] <+ChrisAlgoo> btw, anyone notice that these javelins are THICCCC
[6:51:30] <+thecosmicfly> @Valdorick actually starving yourself helps with speedrunning in games. That's why it's called fasting sbfpRichard
[6:51:33] <Adriangabs> Also we secretly want a Mukbang
[6:51:34] <ScreamLord> Woolie Eat. The Woolie Done. Woolie no do stream on full tumtum
[6:51:37] <Baeltyr> Woolies self imposed Fyrefest Kappa
[6:51:43] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Thanks woolie! Don't push yourself too hard for our expense tho!
[6:51:53] <Valdorick> This is a dark road you're going down Woolie. Soon your hair will bleed, and your body will contort, you'll see no light and go pale... You'll become Pat, basically.
[6:51:55] <dan_g_v> good one, @thecosmicfly
[6:51:56] <ScreamLord> Purple tower
[6:51:58] <Adriangabs> Eat a cheese sandwich at least
[6:52:09] <dan_g_v> eat some cheese at least!
[6:52:22] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @ScreamingMeat That's sum gud rhyme you got there lol
[6:52:49] <+DeadPhoenix3> you can also do quickplay and reinforce somoene else to get xp. give bonus xp in fact i think
[6:53:01] <dan_g_v> quick, somebody go make sandwiches while the loading screen is up. See how many times Woolie could have eaten
[6:53:06] <dekkitout> *beats full mission*
[6:53:11] <ribbot1> always believe chat
[6:53:12] <viridooo> thanks doc
[6:53:13] <EASrake> Big if true
[6:53:19] <Shisno27> well chat has been wrong about everything else so it probably wont work
[6:53:21] <ScreamLord> You can also just do quickplay
[6:53:23] <5xldragonshirt> I heard that the progression in this game funnels you right into playing warframe
[6:53:25] <%QueequegTheater> "BRING MORE FOOD INTO THE DUNGEON"
[6:53:28] <+Axellogic> 3
[6:53:30] <%bananakko> chat monkaS
[6:53:31] <%TeethMuncher> Chat is never wrong, the mob rules
[6:53:31] <MForan98> Yeah, idk, I haven't played a stronghold yet
[6:53:32] <DatAsuna> Chat is always right because chat always says both sides of the claim
[6:53:37] <Valdorick> 3
[6:53:41] <MayorRev> when chat is wrong, press 3
[6:53:41] <zamzoph> WE ALL LIFT TOGETHERRRRRR
[6:53:46] <hntronium> Chat is always right
[6:53:47] <%QueequegTheater> @DatAsuna No it doesn't
[6:53:51] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I'm concerned that the mission only cash in XP for completing it successfully
[6:53:52] <+thecosmicfly> We're too deep into the sunk cost to give up now.
[6:53:55] <%Rezca> Chat is almost always sometimes never wrong?
[6:53:59] <hntronium> When chat is pressing 3 and is wrong, press 4
[6:54:00] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus quickplay is jump into someone's in progress match and get bonus xp
[6:54:02] <Shisno27> especially since you can get XP in freeplay but one random person happened to say that so that becomes "what chat said"
[6:54:03] <+Irridium> quickplay throws you into a mission in progress @WoolieVersus
[6:54:03] <twenty112> I think Quickplay drops you in someone's lobby
[6:54:09] <+TheHeroAppears> woah look at this warframe
[6:54:10] <Valdorick> Look at that Umbra Excal!
[6:54:11] <EASrake> You press a button when selecting a mission and it will frop you into other people's missions already in progress
[6:54:13] <+Dylveryn> @WoolieVersus puts you into an already running mission
[6:54:13] <ScreamLord> You join an in progress team
[6:54:17] <+SuichiTanaka> The Storm is the most fun class, from almost everyone's opinion
[6:54:20] <%QueequegTheater> Umbra is the best melee frame
[6:54:22] <dekkitout> look at this hunter-warlock dream baby
[6:54:22] <DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater People have literally said "that gun is locked" "that gunisn't" .etc mutliple times
[6:54:26] <keiji_maede> Xd
[6:54:27] <king_trito> Lmao woolie the noob
[6:54:27] <ribbot1> pilot the damn robot, shinji
[6:54:28] <+gantz_zero> @dan_g_v 45 seconds, i timed it
[6:54:28] <+Dylveryn> Storm is great
[6:54:30] <keiji_maede> XD
[6:54:31] <NiftyNox> LUL
[6:54:34] <+Lixagon> LUL
[6:54:34] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Minefield!!
[6:54:35] <%QueequegTheater> therefore it is the best frame
[6:54:35] <nicotrumpet> i miss kotor
[6:54:38] <EASrake> i did the same thing LUL
[6:54:39] <%GarbageNirvana> The floor is lava
[6:54:40] <+phatmac16> Lol
[6:54:44] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus you choose either mission or stronghold and when you lauch you dive into another persons game to get loot and XP
[6:54:47] <%QueequegTheater> @DatAsuna woosh
[6:54:49] <+CharminglyMelancholic> @woolieversus is this game any fun or is it Destiny Mech paint job?
[6:54:50] <zamzoph> the floor is lava!
[6:54:55] <Adriangabs> Did...Did you just fly into the wall?
[6:54:59] <king_trito> if storm had a hood with the cape, you can make it look like Dr. Doom as fuck.
[6:55:02] <ScreamLord> 20/20 Vision
[6:55:04] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus for quickplay
[6:55:23] <+ChrisAlgoo> six sets of eyes
[6:55:25] <DatAsuna> Also I'm just chilling undrwater waiting to see if tere's a drowning animation
[6:55:27] <DatAsuna> taking a while
[6:55:31] <keiji_maede> LOL
[6:55:42] <+gantz_zero> your sniper is REALLY strong @WoolieVersus
[6:55:45] <keiji_maede> Welcome to hell! xD
[6:55:56] <ScreamLord> Quickplay it the square button on the mission select and you get pulled into other peoples games if they have a short team
[6:56:03] <DatAsuna> Woolie i literally hangning back and sniping right now
[6:56:07] <DatAsuna> just not with a sniper
[6:56:10] <Valdorick> Woolie has gone from EVA 01 ProTag to guy who Naruto runs across campus Kappa
[6:56:15] <Adriangabs> @DatAsuna LUL
[6:56:18] <hntronium> He gotchu Woolie, don't let your teammates down
[6:56:29] <rhaya2> Hey Woolie are you gonna play FFxi
[6:56:30] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus use the devastator and i meet on normal
[6:56:44] <Shisno27> he's hanging back and doing long range CQC
[6:56:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Ah yes, the RPG nightmare. Where all the numbers are all stacked in the wrong places so you have a bad time
[6:56:48] <%TeethMuncher> My main with Anthem, is that this being put out as a demo when it's clearly a beta
[6:56:53] <+CharminglyMelancholic> Oh fuck, you can give your character Eva colors shit I think I need it.
[6:56:54] <+Robopengy> Is Woolie liking the game?
[6:56:55] <DatAsuna> SMGs are the best snipers
[6:56:57] <+gantz_zero> try your sniper @WoolieVersus
[6:57:00] <DatAsuna> they were in MGO at least
[6:57:05] <ribbot1> shoot anything that glows
[6:57:18] <Xiangchang> We need bigger numbers!
[6:57:21] <DatAsuna> Don't res when they're surrounded
[6:57:26] <viciousgrim> BibleThump
[6:57:27] <rhaya2> Hey Woolie , are you gonna play FFXIV now for that New YORHA lore ? :p
[6:57:31] <king_trito> @TeethMuncher demos and betas are basically the same
[6:57:35] <dekkitout> shield doesnt regen? what gives, is this not a videogame?
[6:57:42] <+gantz_zero> it does @dekkitout
[6:57:52] <Shisno27> it does if you're not getting shot in the side of the head
[6:57:56] <+nycwally> shield does but you need cover
[6:57:57] <ScreamLord> It's a LIE!!!!!!
[6:57:57] <CrimsonCore90> Try hard they said. Unlock the suit they said. it'll be easy they said.
[6:58:02] <%QueequegTheater> HEROES NEVER DIE
[6:58:05] <DatAsuna> Unless the nier raid is a level 10 raid I don't think so
[6:58:10] <+nycwally> game could use a cover system
[6:58:15] <Valdorick> Flashbacks to my early days in Warframe… The pile of downed frames because a heavy gunner is fuck'n your shit up.
[6:58:41] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus I would highly recommend leaving and using Quickplay to do the story missions again.
[6:58:46] <torontototoro> bye y'all KonCha game looks kinda meh so far but it was fun listening to Woolie and Billy teaming up
[6:58:55] <Adriangabs> cya
[6:58:58] <ribbot1> enemies definitely blend into the background
[6:59:01] <Valdorick> Later
[6:59:18] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @rhaya2 FFXIV doesn't seem to be Woolie's cup of tea so it'd be a safer bet just to have him watch or talk with Pat rather than being involved directly
[6:59:37] <DatAsuna> I don't think endgame content will ever bring many new players
[6:59:45] <ScreamLord> Snipers will blow your asshole wide open
[6:59:47] <%TeethMuncher> @king_trito sort of, a demo assumes the game is done, while a beta is a work in progress. Since the game comes out in less than a month, this buggy build just leaves a bad impression
[7:00:08] <%QueequegTheater> Fusion rif;e
[7:00:09] <+gantz_zero> it's REALLY strong though @WoolieVersus
[7:00:13] <Arweynn> best sniper class
[7:00:21] <Valdorick> Really strong* when you hit
[7:00:37] <ScreamLord> Ammo gone
[7:00:38] <Valdorick> R-reload, wools
[7:00:39] <%QueequegTheater> "Hard difficulty is hard"
[7:00:42] <Arweynn> you can oneshot turrets if you can hit the weakspot
[7:00:55] <rhaya2> So hows Anthem Demo so far ?
[7:01:03] <DatAsuna> Weak spots glow yelowwhen you hit the enmy too
[7:01:07] <Adriangabs> Hard mode is fun if it's manageable
[7:01:13] <%QueequegTheater> Why does Woolie have deer hooves
[7:01:26] <%KingLlama1> HDMI does what it wants
[7:01:31] <DatAsuna> because that's one of his 2 new fetishes today
[7:01:32] <%bananakko> haunted hdmi monkaS
[7:01:38] <DatAsuna> It's hoove feet and er cleaning
[7:01:44] <+gantz_zero> it does what it's named eh? @WoolieVersus
[7:01:45] <DatAsuna> *ear
[7:01:52] <EASrake> Now that's what i call
[7:01:52] <%QueequegTheater> EVER
[7:02:02] <Valdorick> Hoof'd feet and fasting are his fetishes today Kappa

[7:04:35] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus devastator is good at killing groups too
[7:04:40] <Ultradoom333> so is this just a warframe clone or...
[7:04:44] <valriot> videogame
[7:04:54] <ExtremeAGamer> Is there close combat in this game? Like weapons or such
[7:05:06] <+thecosmicfly> You have a melee strike
[7:05:07] <+Irridium> there's a shotgun. it's not great
[7:05:12] <+Reizie_Etherealm> There's a way to make sure chat is actually correct and make it easier for Woolie to take in factual information
[7:05:15] <%TeethMuncher> @Ultradoom333 it's bogged down by lack of quality of life features
[7:05:17] <Adriangabs> there's a melee swipe
[7:05:22] <CrimsonCore90> This isn't punch daddy. we need to see punches in bunches!
[7:05:24] <+thecosmicfly> One of the warfra err javelins is more melee focused
[7:05:27] <%Rezca> but the ammo is low
[7:05:31] <DatAsuna> It's more destiny clone than warframe
[7:05:32] <ScreamLord> Explosive sniper shots

[7:09:22] <stormfang24> This one
[7:09:23] <FleshFriend> The interceptor has the most defined butt
[7:09:24] <valriot> M A G E
[7:09:24] <hntronium> Kill Tuesday Nights
[7:09:24] <NiftyNox> Kappa

[7:09:43] <hntronium> CAPES
[7:09:43] <CrimsonCore90> Feel the Storm!!!!!
[7:09:46] <DatAsuna> GREEN GIRLS R US
[7:09:46] <hntronium> NO CAPES
[7:09:53] <Shisno27> GREEN OH NO
[7:09:54] <+SuichiTanaka> Colossus is boring and weak till you get drops. Storm is fucking badass flying mage. And Interceptor is a dual blade rogue.
[7:09:55] <FleshFriend> intercept the booty
[7:09:57] <ScreamLord> Colossus literally looks like BT from Titanfall 2
[7:09:59] <UnfilteredComic> I named my Colossus BT-173 @WoolieVersus
[7:09:59] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S MAG ALL OVER AGAIN
[7:10:01] <dekkitout> blah blah space magic
[7:10:05] <+gantz_zero> magic boi @WoolieVersus
[7:10:06] <SwindlerOfProgress> This looks more like Warframe than I thought it would.
[7:10:06] <+kukadin> Is the sound broken?
[7:10:10] <dan_g_v> talking about Titans, what does Woolie think about the new Titan Fall without Titans?
[7:10:15] <dekkitout> ice damage on storm is busted
[7:10:16] <DatAsuna> A mage that can fly way longer
[7:10:17] <+thecosmicfly> Ok, but what if Colossus had a cape and a warframe tier butt. OP or nah?
[7:10:17] <+gwanzan> Storm has heaven's artillery
[7:10:18] <+SuichiTanaka> Mag is a goddamn GREAT frame though.
[7:10:18] <arkv01> we got magic ass skills in this powersuit game?
[7:10:26] <twenty112> WELCOME BACK, PILOT
[7:10:28] <dan_g_v> you know, the Fall Royale
[7:10:28] <+kukadin> it was my dumb ass nvm
[7:10:28] <+gantz_zero> lies, he can't @WoolieVersus
[7:10:28] <Shisno27> not infinite flying no
[7:10:29] <ScreamLord> Storm can HOVER infinitely
[7:10:29] <%KingLlama1> 2012+7 = not having 4 screens streaming Kamen rider on X 1.5 speed so you can catch up
[7:10:32] <CrimsonCore90> Zubaz!!!
[7:10:32] <+Irridium> no it does have a cooldown
[7:10:33] <+Arkfyre> flying is the samne, you can hover for longer
[7:10:33] <Shisno27> Nooooooooooooope
[7:10:34] <+gantz_zero> it's not infinite no @WoolieVersus
[7:10:36] <UnfilteredComic> Can hover forever
[7:10:37] <dekkitout> mag is s tier with polarize augment
[7:10:41] <+Irridium> it is most definitely not infinite
[7:10:45] <Fabric_tester> Hover not flight
[7:10:49] <Shisno27> "it can fly forever" - Minh, being super wrong
[7:10:51] <+kungfauxboi> no they can fly longer
[7:10:54] <SpoonJuggler> Other than the interceptor, the designs are so...bland
[7:10:55] <+SuichiTanaka> Mag got major buffs a long while back and is top tier
[7:10:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Excuse me, I believe the term is warlock
[7:10:57] <vellas2009> storm can hover for like a minute at a time
[7:11:05] <hntronium> The difference between floating and flying
[7:11:06] <UnfilteredComic> Big Ground Slam with knockdown
[7:11:07] <+SuichiTanaka> Storm can hover nearly infinite
[7:11:15] <SGrim> Colossus is single big punch
[7:11:18] <Adriangabs> You know what else is not Infinite? Marvel Infinite
[7:11:18] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus no but fly for a very long time i run storm
[7:11:20] <EASrake> Functionally infinite
[7:11:21] <DatAsuna> quickly quote him

[7:11:35] <stormfang24> Titan fall without titan the hell is that
[7:11:36] <SGrim> Interceptor is rabbit punches
[7:11:40] <ScreamLord> Big fist punch on ground
[7:11:44] <+gantz_zero> Interceptor has actually infinite melee with no cooldown @WoolieVersus
[7:11:45] <twenty112> COME ON AND SLAM
[7:11:47] <+SuichiTanaka> Interceptor is a dual blade rogue.
[7:11:49] <+MrIntake> ground slam and air slam, melee shield as well @WoolieVersus
[7:11:50] <Adriangabs> Minh don't follow Pat's path BibleThump
[7:11:50] <krymzen5> inter looks dope
[7:11:54] <FleshFriend> Interceptor looks like it's sponsored by spriteor something
[7:12:00] <Arweynn> storm is good, low hp but BIG ability damage
[7:12:01] <DatAsuna> If you pick interceptor it literally tells you it's not for noobs
[7:12:05] <dekkitout> its the weeb cla- i mean rogue
[7:12:09] <arkv01> I guess we should UNIT-02 colors now

[7:12:56] <DatAsuna> >past tense
[7:12:57] <ScreamLord> Apparently this is all already fixed in the final build or currently being fixed
[7:12:58] <Shisno27> YOU CANT HANDLE THIS UNLOCK

[7:17:26] <%QueequegTheater> I want EA to patch out all purple colors
[7:17:38] <+MrIntake> theres a bug in the demo where if you keep playing itll give you two more unlocks so you can try the other ones. i have all 4 LUL
[7:17:40] <UnfilteredComic> I really like Colossus, but Storm seems much more fun
[7:17:44] <+gantz_zero> @Shisno27 they actually unlocked them seemingly as an apology for the network issues

[7:22:25] <%TeethMuncher> Is there a randomize option?
[7:22:26] <ribbot1> genji colors
[7:22:30] <krymzen5> i think it's to get around making 2 sets of each armor
[7:22:32] <MForan98> That's a lot of questions from someone that doesn't care about the story lol
[7:22:35] <+Arkfyre> mada mada

[7:24:57] <DatAsuna> Federation force samus
[7:25:09] <+thecosmicfly> Ok I'll give Anthem a point for the variety in textures, that's a good customisable feature
[7:25:09] <Adriangabs> they really put Need for Speed's color system in here huh?
[7:25:15] <+gantz_zero> that sounds goofy but i don't disagree @ScreamingMeat

[7:26:59] <Adriangabs> the textures are a good touch

[7:27:46] <+Irridium> you should look at the alternate armor you might be able to do something there
[7:27:46] <+gantz_zero> you can buy those cosmetic armor pieces now @WoolieVersus
[7:27:49] <Adriangabs> needs to be a bit more saturated
[7:27:50] <%OBS_VinnieK> You can try getting the other head

[7:28:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> You could make a Toku looking suit
[7:28:11] <%cervidaequus> why does he look like he has a single A cup in the center of the chest like a monoboob
[7:28:12] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus buy the other body parts
[7:28:13] <+thecosmicfly> Here* damn keyboard
[7:28:20] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus hey, go back one and look for a different head piece maybe?
[7:28:30] <Fabric_tester> But how about a Wing?
[7:28:35] <%OBS_VinnieK> Other head type may make it work
[7:28:36] <DatAsuna> white/black always work as accent colours
[7:28:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> well those shades of purple and green is very Eva Unit 1
[7:28:54] <EASrake> I don't see the point of copying a color scheme. I'd just rather have my own thing

[7:38:01] <@Solidus_113> I left to play RE2 for like 2 hours
[7:38:02] <TheMeromex> that was a sign that your color scheme was neede to change!
[7:38:03] <kingdudeby> But woolie, not all Anthem content is available in the Demo.
[7:38:03] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> YEYEYEYE

[7:38:14] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Woolie pls
[7:38:42] <thesw1tch> @easrake cool cosmetic or achievement stuff can carry over. just something rewarding for the time. dont screw customers giving you their time, especially when the game is as buggy as it is
[7:38:57] <%Rezca> at least recreation is easy enough
[7:38:58] <+Axellogic> You hadnt backed out of the forge yet
[7:39:02] <%Rivalshotzgp> woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[7:39:03] <+Axellogic> it saves when you back out
[7:39:05] <waifoong98> Eyyyy, I got that often in Warframe, the game update just trash my entire Fav Color tabs.
[7:39:15] <arkv01> WOOLIE EATCHO BURGAS
[7:39:15] <@akuda_bar> you know i can't hear the music well on the stream but is it as good as it sounded at the game awards
[7:39:22] <$KnivesEve> so, you gonna check out warframe one more time sometime later in da future? @WoolieVersus
[7:39:22] <Adriangabs> Awwww :(
[7:39:38] <+gantz_zero> "screw customers over" you play demos to see if the thing is interesting enough to warrant a full purchase @WoolieVersus
[7:39:44] <+gantz_zero> ooops
[7:39:46] <EASrake> @thesw1tch They gave you free money so you can try out cosmetics. no way are they letting you keep them. Being able to try a game for free before it is out it the reward
[7:39:46] <gunsrlove> what music ?
[7:39:48] <+gantz_zero> ignore that
[7:39:56] <ribbot1> orange is not a good crotch color
[7:39:59] <Holofono> my eyes... WutFace
[7:40:05] <zamzoph> I think it was black
[7:40:12] <%Rivalshotzgp> woolieCHAN
[7:40:22] <@akuda_bar> @gunsrlove is that how you feel about it or are you asking lol
[7:40:29] <Adriangabs> I'm tapping out, cya Woolz and chat
[7:40:32] <gunsrlove> asking
[7:40:39] <%TeethMuncher> @fighterman classic fire crotch though
[7:40:41] <gunsrlove> kind of
[7:40:52] <+Irridium> it was all rubber I think
[7:40:57] <zamzoph> all rubber
[7:40:58] <gunsrlove> i mean it has some nice tones, anthem's ost
[7:41:00] <@akuda_bar> they had a big live orchestra piece with synth vocals and stuff and it was dope
[7:41:01] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus check the unlock shaders
[7:41:02] <gunsrlove> but mostly its
[7:41:06] <gunsrlove> music of game
[7:41:10] <@akuda_bar> aww
[7:41:23] <EASrake> The music in the hub isn't too bad
[7:41:43] <Shisno27> NO SHUT UP MINH LETS JUST PLAY
[7:41:43] <ribbot1> is that pistol pointing at you
[7:41:48] <waifoong98> Blurgh
[7:41:56] <DatAsuna> bumpy
[7:42:00] <Geno4344> use big O colors
[7:42:06] <+cerass> @woolieversus just logged back into the game to maybe run into you. I lost ALL PROGRESS AND SOMEHOW IM LVL 1
[7:42:07] <EASrake> There are also stencils too
[7:42:16] <+thecosmicfly> Again, this is true end game content
[7:42:18] <+Irridium> I don't know that one song that plays over a radio near your javalin is madness inducing
[7:42:20] <waifoong98> Man, Armored Core 5 custom stickers put these vinyls to shame LUL
[7:42:23] <Fabric_tester> @woolieversus Vinyls?
[7:42:24] <Koji104> is that an eva
[7:42:25] <DatAsuna> That's something I'd like to see tho
[7:42:26] <+SuichiTanaka> Fashion Frame is always the true end game.
[7:42:27] <Geno4344> Eva is so cliche
[7:42:28] <Arweynn> COLOR THE DOLLS
[7:42:30] <+BrightSoleilVT> Less shooting more customizing!
[7:42:31] <DatAsuna> shove another 20 materials in there
[7:42:35] <+SuichiTanaka> Even Pat knows that
[7:42:37] <+phatmac16> Set us free
[7:42:37] <+Axellogic> Dressing up your robodolls is endgame content GET ON OUR LEVEL
[7:42:37] <%Rezca> Man, I could really go for some armored core right now
[7:42:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie has to look pretty no1CHU
[7:42:48] <waifoong98> @Rezca DEW IT
[7:42:49] <+gantz_zero> Geno is overrated Kappa @Geno4344
[7:42:51] <%TeethMuncher> This makes me want to play FashionFrame
[7:42:53] <+Lixagon> fashionframe
[7:42:56] <+Lixagon> LUL
[7:42:57] <ThatLoliFromPersona> Where's the fancy hats PogChamp
[7:42:59] <gunsrlove> FashionFrame
[7:43:00] <+MrIntake> fashion is always endgame ohnRaiden
[7:43:03] <%Rivalshotzgp> Fashionframe
[7:43:03] <arkv01> cmon woolie we're so dry, moisturize us with some mukky bang
[7:43:09] <%OBS_VinnieK> Glamour is the real endgame
[7:43:11] <+Huttersson> This 'content' so far is the only thing that is really selling me to the game, so good on woolie!
[7:43:12] <+thecosmicfly> Y'know what sucks. Fashion Anthem doesn't have a good ring to it
[7:43:14] <ribbot1> i thought big o was just all black
[7:43:16] <Arweynn> Fashon frame/souls/ect is the true endgame
[7:43:32] <+Tarkus110> when we doing Sam's colors from Vanquish?
[7:43:41] <Holofono> Fashion MonHun too
[7:43:48] <+gantz_zero> he does you don't have the module yet, it's loot @WoolieVersus
[7:43:52] <gunsrlove> Oh he hasnt played it yet LUL
[7:43:53] <$KnivesEve> dressing up dolls is always fun gameplay
[7:44:02] <waifoong98> @Holofono no transmogrify in world, feelsbadman
[7:44:08] <+chippracoon> ya you just don't have much for the armor yet
[7:44:11] <+thecosmicfly> MonHun has no fashion. Only Min/Max builds
[7:44:12] <+Lieutori> Big O has some red gold and white accents but yes, it's mostly black
[7:44:18] <EASrake> Yeah interceptor deons't start with one. Not sure what is available to it
[7:44:20] <+Irridium> @waifoong98 still no trasmog? damn
[7:44:37] <waifoong98> @Irridium ey, only in X series
[7:44:38] <+ChrisAlgoo> the goku arrival
[7:44:52] <EASrake> That's a loot box opening effect if i've ever seen one
[7:44:58] <thesw1tch> @easrake well, if people think just playing is it's own reward, then that's their perogative. I think they should offer something to the beta testers, especially with how buggy the game is. it's called retaining, but this shows another way how little ea cares about the actual consumer
[7:45:11] <+SuichiTanaka> Interceptor has a triple jump and a good dodge
[7:45:17] <waifoong98> Inb4 it crashes during Matchmaking again LUL
[7:45:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh god, loot systems ugh >(
[7:45:29] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus do lower levels with new javelin
[7:45:43] <@akuda_bar> lol i found the main menu music, sounded better live :(
[7:45:56] <%Rivalshotzgp> Plague streams best time zone
[7:46:11] <%TeethMuncher> ^
[7:46:12] <MForan98> @thesw1tch counter point: No one does that already, so why would EA of all people adopt that idea?
[7:46:18] <EASrake> @thesw1tch Okay. Regardless of the current state of the game, This is not a beta test. This is a playable demonstration (DEMO) of the game. It was not advertised as a beta test. It is not a beta test.
[7:46:20] <waifoong98> man what a shame, game has so much potential. Yet so much stupid shit keeps keeping it down.
[7:46:23] <Kurodius> I feel like interceptor's barely faster than the other suits
[7:46:27] <+thecosmicfly> RIP Kirby
[7:46:28] <MForan98> yes i agree it needs to change
[7:46:29] <max_radical> keep in mind friends, woolie is about to do a stronghold, strongholds being the only endgame in anthem, and the game will launch with 3 including the one he's about to do
[7:46:29] <waifoong98> *kicking
[7:46:38] <Slimeking_Mike> F kirby
[7:46:39] <+timblenaut> kirb!
[7:46:41] <shiroyaa_> KIRBEEHH BibleThump
[7:46:41] <MForan98> but it's just not under the current landscape
[7:46:41] <ScreamLord> Kirby no! BibleThump
[7:46:43] <+gantz_zero> he looks fine on stream? @WoolieVersus
[7:46:44] <@akuda_bar> ganbate kirby
[7:46:45] <Kurodius> WHAT
[7:46:45] <gunsrlove> INterceptor wasnt even that fast
[7:46:45] <%Rivalshotzgp> F
[7:46:48] <arkv01> just call them frames woolie, javelins a dumb term
[7:46:50] <stormfang24> Kirby no
[7:46:51] <gunsrlove> but it gets three dashes
[7:46:56] <@Solidus_113> woolieMIRIN
[7:46:57] <$KnivesEve> kirby doesnt die. he just sleeps for a bit
[7:46:57] <+phatmac16> F
[7:47:03] <%TeethMuncher> Chat, where do I get a kirby lamp like Woolie's?
[7:47:04] <Arweynn> but how do you kill that which refuses to be killed?
[7:47:09] <DatAsuna> stretchy stretch
[7:47:13] <+MrIntake> its the memory that counts ohnTen
[7:47:26] <+gantz_zero> Minh, he hears you
[7:47:29] <thesw1tch> @easrake imo early access demos are betas. semantics i suppose
[7:47:35] <gunsrlove> The demo cuts out often
[7:47:39] <gunsrlove> it could just be that
[7:47:40] <Arweynn> sound glitches out in this dungeon
[7:47:48] <DatAsuna> it''s woolie he can't hear
[7:48:04] <kingdudeby> I had a bug yesterday where all the enemies were invisible and could hurt me but I couldn't hurt them.
[7:48:05] <ScreamLord> DEAF!!!
[7:48:09] <waifoong98> Oooopph
[7:48:09] <+cerass> how did he change the colors?
[7:48:09] <Shisno27> they're in a PS4 party, not the game here
[7:48:24] <hntronium> Billy dead
[7:48:40] <%TeethMuncher> @kingdudeby that's just hard mode /s
[7:48:40] <max_radical> "hey dude, just letting you know you cant hear me. ok cool"
[7:48:42] <Shisno27> Woolie your shield comes back faster if you are moving fast
[7:48:45] <BlacSoul> When do I get to change my Jav?
[7:48:46] <+NiktenKing> If you hold down circle you can triple vector dash
[7:48:48] <EASrake> @thesw1tch Regardless. The current state of the game is probabl turning away a lot of the people who installed it for the demo.
[7:48:52] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you can chain melee repeatedly and the juping attack does gross big damage
[7:49:04] <zamzoph> the zippy class hiding behind a rock LUL
[7:49:05] <gunsrlove> It's just Destiny Plus
[7:49:07] <+gantz_zero> we can hear you Minh
[7:49:19] <hntronium> Chat hears Billy
[7:49:27] <%TeethMuncher> Minh's in the shadow realm
[7:49:29] <thesw1tch> @mforan98 counterpoint, companies do indeed offer incentives to play betas and have some shit if you played the beta and then buy and play the regular game. learning now it's a demo though, and not a beta, so that changes things
[7:49:32] <keiji_maede> Rould 2..... FIGHT!!
[7:49:33] <+Irridium> @WoolieVersus if you hold dodge you do a biiiiiig dodge that you can change directions in mid-dash
[7:50:07] <+thecosmicfly> Game crashes, screens blacking out, headset audio breaking
[7:50:07] <+SuichiTanaka> You're meant to be in melee with this Javelin, zipping around
[7:50:11] <+cerass> @woolieversus this is the same bug I had. only fix is to close the game out. it shuts out all audio including system sounds
[7:50:14] <+thecosmicfly> This is what happens when you don't eat
[7:50:40] <DatAsuna> @cerass you should @ billy with that, not woolie
[7:50:46] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 8 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 32oz (960mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[7:50:58] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus new javelins feel way weaker because you don't have all the parts
[7:51:03] <ithonmage> did woolie drop his shield Kappa?
[7:51:10] <+gantz_zero> god i love interceptor
[7:51:10] <+kukadin> its winning him over
[7:51:13] <+gantz_zero> that is Anthem for me
[7:51:20] <EASrake> 8 hours ResidentSleeper PogChamp
[7:51:22] <%Rezca> What is the Kamen rider BS
[7:51:26] <thesw1tch> @easrake exactly. offering some incentives to keep people who might be turned away by the current state of the game should be a priority of the company. then again, with how this is all being handled, some people are definitely getting let go after the project is finished
[7:51:27] <+cerass> @datasuna dont know what his @ in here is
[7:51:32] <keiji_maede> shotgun mine boi
[7:51:44] <DatAsuna> soushinsen i think
[7:51:45] <Louie_Salmon> i I
[7:51:50] <gunsrlove> Valkyr, but not
[7:51:59] <goroke> @WoolieVersus Color is like Strider Hiryu
[7:52:05] <+cerass> @datasuna doesn't show up
[7:52:16] <DietDrDoom> Hold dodge to do up to three consecutive dodges that can change direction.
[7:52:17] <Shisno27> @WoolieVersus if you move quickly your shields come back faster
[7:52:21] <%TeethMuncher> @thesw1tch Didn't bioware offer incentives to those in the VIP Demo or something similar?
[7:52:21] <DatAsuna> Billy's rebooting anyway
[7:52:28] <goroke> Color IT
[7:52:39] <EASrake> @thesw1tch I see your point. But due to the nature of this game. I don't think an achievement or a sticker for your suit is gonna keep people around. They'd have to go real big.
[7:53:01] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus holding dash lets you boost dash three times. Every time you drop from air to ground you can chain another set of dashes. Fast traversal
[7:53:13] <+cerass> how do you change colors I can only change material @woolieversus
[7:53:16] <DatAsuna> Can't be toe dipping when you go in
[7:53:17] <+thecosmicfly> The only way to save anthem is to offer canvas bags to all pre-order owners
[7:53:21] <DatAsuna> you go in or you don't
[7:53:27] <DatAsuna> not in 'n out :P
[7:53:28] <%Rezca> @cerass go right one
[7:53:42] <+Axellogic> The color is just press right on the material
[7:53:48] <Arweynn> ps4 drive corrupted
[7:54:01] <ShacharN7> you have triple jump and triple dash
[7:54:13] <+cerass> @rezca holy hell that is the LEAST intuitive thing I've ever seen @woolieversus
[7:54:18] <+gantz_zero> you can charge your L1 and then throw out a kind of homing shuriken @WoolieVersus
[7:54:31] <SiegeJay> Is this just Bad Warframe?
[7:54:32] <Shisno27> @WoolieVersus moving at high speed makes your shields come back faster
[7:54:32] <+Dova573> my favorite thing from this game was flying and then doing meele mid air
[7:54:37] <DatAsuna> where's storm?
[7:54:41] <+Axellogic> Its chonky frame
[7:54:41] <DatAsuna> there he is
[7:55:07] <Shisno27> @WoolieVersus it's special to the interceptor, yeah
[7:55:08] <+SuichiTanaka> This particular Javelin is bad warframe
[7:55:11] <max_radical> can someone link billy's twitch if he's streaming
[7:55:16] <+ThusTerribly> Revives are hard to spot in the demo because the version with team UI isn't out yet
[7:55:17] <zamzoph> GOTTA GO FAST
[7:55:21] <+TaifuDragon> @WoolieVersus use your hover a lot too, it should reset your jumps
[7:55:37] <ShacharN7> hold circle to dash further and restore Shields
[7:55:45] <+Axellogic> Also melee attacks are great at stunklocking enemies. If you just melee the sheild guys they cant stop you
[7:55:50] <SiegeJay> @suichitanaka Rename this Javelin: Bad Warframe
[7:56:13] <+chippracoon> Btw sniper is not a good weapon for that armor
[7:56:14] <mongol_800> Woolie playing Anthem? What is this heresy!?
[7:56:26] <%Rezca> The stunlock is strong
[7:56:35] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus Don't forget to hold down your dash button to get super in and super out easily
[7:56:39] <+Axellogic> Also using your Ult full heals you
[7:56:41] <SiegeJay> Someone call me when WOOLIE plays Fallout 76
[7:56:58] <max_radical> why the FUCK would he do that jay
[7:57:04] <MForan98> @mongol_800 it's effectively a mech game so you souldn't be that surprised
[7:57:15] <EASrake> SeemsGood
[7:57:15] <zamzoph> Devil Trigger PogChamp
[7:57:16] <SiegeJay> Also I am still rolling that Fallout 76 was a PODCAST sponsor PixelBob
[7:57:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> ah yes my favorite melee move, spin to win
[7:57:40] <+Axellogic> Dont fear the sheild guys as Interceptor
[7:57:48] <+Axellogic> If you melee them you stunlockthem
[7:57:54] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus you do not have all of your systems i say play other missions and aim at shield guys feet or arms with the devastator
[7:57:57] <EASrake> No, the're just kind of there to make the objective harder to do
[7:58:09] <+cerass> !uptime
[7:58:19] <+gantz_zero> the enemies still make the objective harder to do, you're not doing anything wrong @WoolieVersus
[7:58:25] <+cerass> welp how long has he been playing?
[7:58:37] <+Irridium> like six, seven hours?
[7:58:54] <+thecosmicfly> What was woolie playing before Anthem?
[7:58:58] <@Solidus_113> closer to 7 and a half
[7:59:06] <Shisno27> ahegao academy I think
[7:59:08] <+ThusTerribly> Quick, spam waves
[7:59:12] <@Solidus_113> he finished up Ahegao
[7:59:12] <EASrake> Flare?
[7:59:33] <+thecosmicfly> So he traded down then
[7:59:38] <EASrake> LUL I hope that makes it to live
[8:00:33] <+gantz_zero> you can triple dodge and jump now @WoolieVersus
[8:00:42] <Ether101_Prime> No running glitches? Good.
[8:00:50] <+cerass> @woolieversus if you fly close to water you overheat slower
[8:00:59] <+gantz_zero> he knows
[8:01:09] <+cerass> ah my b lol
[8:01:10] <+ThusTerribly> None of the missions we've seen have infinite spawning enemies (that I saw) so clearing the mobs is always viable and pretty good
[8:01:13] <+gantz_zero> no worries
[8:01:49] <max_radical> @WoolieVersus YO WOOLIE did you hear about that rumored Titanfall battle royale?
[8:02:09] <EASrake> That was a sick barrel roll
[8:02:10] <gunsrlove> WITH NO TITANS
[8:02:23] <ShacharN7> you can hold circle to dash further
[8:02:29] <@Solidus_113> it's not Titanfall, it's just in the same universe
[8:02:30] <+Axellogic> Yep and intercepter gets a unique dodge and jump if you hold the button down
[8:02:36] <+cerass> there's some cool stuff with the "wizard" class too. if you freeze an enemy and then kill it with melee it spreads the freeze to other enemies @woolieversus
[8:02:43] <+gantz_zero> look at that BASS CANNON
[8:02:49] <mongol_800> Whoa.. woolie playing with Subs?
[8:02:55] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus you can dodge and right after attack
[8:03:02] <+gantz_zero> no just his old roommate and friend Minh @mongol_800
[8:03:12] <Ether101_Prime> Are they fighting Noise Marines?
[8:03:16] <EASrake> Storm also has a pretty unique sprint animation where they float dash across the ground
[8:03:17] <mongol_800> oh! Billy kun!
[8:03:19] <+ThusTerribly> @cerass That's called combos and you can do it with any "primer" elemental move and any "detonator" move.
[8:03:52] <mongol_800> !uptime
[8:04:01] <+gantz_zero> you have no bot here
[8:04:02] <+stoutfish> woolie it's 4am
[8:04:08] <shiroyaa_> @mongol_800 8:13
[8:04:09] <EASrake> Streams been up for 8:13
[8:04:10] <+gantz_zero> yeah but he's having fun
[8:04:17] <@Solidus_113> something something lost control of my life
[8:04:17] <mongol_800> ahh tq dudes :)
[8:04:28] <+cerass> didn't know that the only other combo I ran into was poison into grenade or lightning melee into grenade
[8:04:31] <mongol_800> how long has he been on Anthem?
[8:04:34] <sileo_patronus> Wait he's still going?
[8:04:41] <@Solidus_113> about 5 hours
[8:04:47] <@Solidus_113> woolieDATTEBAYO
[8:04:52] <mongol_800> whoa niice :)
[8:04:58] <+stoutfish> does this game have better gameplay than kingdom hearts?
[8:05:04] <EASrake> ?
[8:05:07] <gunsrlove> AnDestiny
[8:05:24] <Grimm0192> whats up woolie used to watch sbf! didn't ya'll broke up untill recent
[8:05:26] <mongol_800> cant wait for next podcast if they talk about it
[8:05:27] <+ThusTerribly> It's subtle on a lot of other classes because they don't have elemental primers by default. Colossus's melee actually works as a detonator. He's a fun thicc boi.
[8:05:42] <+Mythicalbrit> why cant I hear this stream?
[8:06:00] <@Solidus_113> there's audio
[8:06:04] <+gantz_zero> they will undoubtedly, but pat started it and was like NUH MOVEMENT SUCKS @mongol_800
[8:06:10] <+gantz_zero> your problem not the streams @MyNameIsRasus
[8:06:28] <ValentineHearts> god I hate to say this but it has worse gameplay than KH3
[8:06:45] <+gantz_zero> what the fuck are you high
[8:06:48] <+stoutfish> we'll it's an online loot shooter so that's understandable
[8:06:49] <DatAsuna> to be fair it tired that warframe open world expac and quit after 20 mins cause th movement
[8:06:51] <+Axellogic> I feel bad but I think its hilarious when you headbutt the walls Woolz
[8:06:51] <+ThusTerribly> that's a very bad take
[8:06:56] <mongol_800> haha yeah i could see Pat saying that after Warframe and the rampant bullet jumping
[8:07:10] <ShacharN7> hold circle to dash further
[8:07:13] <+gantz_zero> anthem has awesome gameplay
[8:07:30] <+thecosmicfly> I mean this game doesn't let you throw goofy at enemies like a missile so he might have a point
[8:07:35] <Grimm0192> i like this better than warframe
[8:07:37] <sileo_patronus> Why compare a multiplayer lootshooter to a squenix action rpg?
[8:07:40] <gunsrlove> ground movement is great, shooting is ok
[8:07:40] <DatAsuna> TBH I would rather they mae inteceptr melee r2 and her shuriiken triangle
[8:07:42] <gunsrlove> flying sucks
[8:07:45] <Sielas> @WoolieVersus has the game been working so far?
[8:07:46] <gunsrlove> on a mouse especially
[8:07:47] <Ether101_Prime> I'd rather miss sometimes then have poor mobility all of the time.
[8:07:53] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> I’m kinda having fun with this demo sbfpDattebayo
[8:07:54] <+krispen_wa> but this game also doesn't shove attractions in your face every 5 seconds
[8:07:59] <Fabric_tester> I dont like the gunplay and it is kinda slow movement
[8:08:03] <EASrake> Anthem and Warframe's combat are different enough to scratch different itches for me
[8:08:06] <mongol_800> i love the flying in freeplay
[8:08:09] <+iwasJase> WHO'S TALKING
[8:08:17] <gunsrlove> they are different combat wise
[8:08:18] <gunsrlove> ye
[8:08:19] <Kurodius> I find it really upsetting you can't shoot while flying, only while hovering
[8:08:21] <Sielas> It sounds like the fake dialogue in Ubisoft trailers
[8:08:24] <Shisno27> the ghosts
[8:08:28] <+ThusTerribly> @gunsrlove have you messed with flight sensitivity settings? It's really awkward to get used to but I fiddled with it and feel relatively comfortable (admittedly on my slow as shit Colossus tho)
[8:08:30] <Kurodius> and I kinda hate how the flying feels on its own
[8:08:33] <DatAsuna> You can ult while flying but that's it
[8:08:33] <+Axellogic> Theres invincibility on your dodge woolie
[8:08:35] <ValentineHearts> are you watching the same impactless melee and boring depthless bullshit I am? I wanna be clear, i think KH as a series despite its charm has terrible gameplay. I think this is just uninspired in comparison
[8:08:46] <+Axellogic> you can dodge right when they explode
[8:08:50] <EASrake> Also archwings suck and flying is more fun in anthem
[8:08:55] <zero_g_toad> \[T]/ praise it! @woolieversus
[8:08:56] <DatAsuna> I'd still rather play this than KH
[8:09:01] <gunsrlove> Anthem feels like Desitny Plus. And even if the core is good, i think it gets hard dropped
[8:09:03] <gunsrlove> after about a month
[8:09:09] <max_radical> @cayvalentine let people like stuff :)
[8:09:18] <DatAsuna> KH should go back to being a terrible card system
[8:09:20] <+gantz_zero> @DatAsuna hey some people are happy driving nails into their scrotum. you do you
[8:09:51] <DatAsuna> @gunsrlove agreed
[8:09:52] <mongol_800> ohh shit! just realized woolie is Interceptor ... he's gonna have a haaard time against this boss!
[8:09:53] <+ThusTerribly> @cayvalentine He's playing on the lower difficulty and people aren't really utilizing the combo system yet. Just because you aren't seeing the depth doesn't mean it's not there. KH3 is transparently mashing X and then Triangle when you hit X enough
[8:09:54] <+Mythicalbrit> anyone knw why a specific stream might be completely soundless for someone?
[8:09:54] <+cerass> @woolieversus wish I had been up earlier maybe would have ran into you online
[8:09:56] <gunsrlove> KH is a game for children
[8:10:01] <BurdRightsActivist> Awesome to see you playing warframe! I thought that was Pat's thing.
[8:10:07] <+thecosmicfly> Quick shoutouts to Rayman Origins/Legends for great underwater levels
[8:10:09] <Grimm0192> this game is nothing like kh3
[8:10:21] <mongol_800> Good luck @WoolieVersus Interceptor vs bug boss ;)
[8:10:32] <Sielas> This dialogue is so cringe NotLikeThis
[8:10:32] <DatAsuna> anthem has this weird thing going on where calling it boring isn't enough
[8:10:33] <EASrake> There some serious bait in chat tonight
[8:10:42] <%fillmydarksoulwithlight> does this game look good y/n?
[8:10:43] <DatAsuna> people need to cal it boring by saying other gme is better
[8:10:44] <Ether101_Prime> Kingdom Hearts should go back to being fun and not the condescending mess that it currently is...or at lest fix that running bug.
[8:10:48] <gunsrlove> the suit gameplay isnt boring
[8:10:53] <gunsrlove> in a mission
[8:10:55] <Kurodius> can someone clarify something for me
[8:10:55] <DatAsuna> at least destiny and warframe seem rleevant when they use those
[8:10:58] <+stoutfish> this dialogue is giving me mass effect andromeda flashbacks
[8:10:59] <Sielas> Calling a game boring is the most damning comment I can imagine
[8:11:02] <gunsrlove> in free roam theres nothing to do, in the demo at least
[8:11:05] <gunsrlove> The hub world
[8:11:12] <Kurodius> I played the VIP demo and heard it was an apparently old build of the game
[8:11:12] <gunsrlove> is annoying and slow, and too much talking
[8:11:13] <BurdRightsActivist> awesome """"bioware"""" game
[8:11:22] <Kurodius> is the demo this weekend updated or something?
[8:11:24] <+gantz_zero> triple jump though @WoolieVersus
[8:11:26] <DatAsuna> free roam hs some public events i ran into
[8:11:27] <Kurodius> or is it the same build?
[8:11:28] <waifoong98> @Sielas I dunno, game not working is even worse
[8:11:29] <MONSTR_UwU> when is this out?
[8:11:30] <%KingLlama1> To save our mother earth from evil alien attack
[8:11:30] <+krispen_wa> awesome """"""bioware""""""" """""""""""""game""""""""""""""""
[8:11:35] <DatAsuna> the public events are actually annoying tho
[8:11:36] <EASrake> Hub sucks, needs a sprint of fast travel menu
[8:11:37] <shiroyaa_> @DatAsuna didn't you know that every game now is a combination of other games
[8:11:37] <Shisno27> I downloaded the first 100 megabytes of anthem and it was the most boring senseless drull I've ever experienced, I would rather inject cockroaches into my spinal cord
[8:11:40] <DatAsuna> I'd rather just roam
[8:11:46] <EASrake> or both
[8:11:47] <gunsrlove> Hub alredy has a sprint
[8:11:52] <gunsrlove> it's just barely noticable
[8:12:01] <Fabric_tester> I guess that is just that I hate Bioware gunplay
[8:12:03] <Sielas> @waifoong98 but then you can delude yourself that it might get fixed. If it's working as intended and it's boring...
[8:12:05] <EASrake> like an actual sprint tho
[8:12:11] <+ThusTerribly> @Kurodius unfortunately they didn't get the newer build out for the demo but there have been a lot of changes according to their posts on Reddit and whatnot. Overhauled team UI so you know when people go down is nice. And no, hub doesn't have a sprint in the demo yet but it's confirmed in full release.
[8:12:19] <+stoutfish> they should have made jade empire two instead
[8:12:26] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus just get the items to stop the enemies and look at the numders the devastator does to the boss
[8:12:37] <gunsrlove> HUb does have a sprint, have you played this demo?
[8:12:40] <waifoong98> @Sielas I didn't imply that it would get fixed nor do I have any interest of buying this shit tbf
[8:12:47] <+krispen_wa> they should have just rehired everyone who left that was actually good at writing
[8:12:48] <gunsrlove> your character even starts panting after about a minute :D
[8:12:52] <EASrake> I figured this was an old build. Still a lot of issues that were present in the closed beta
[8:12:53] <xmetalicdemonx> just got in what have I missed?
[8:12:55] <gunsrlove> of barely jogging
[8:13:07] <+gantz_zero> chat being a cesspool as usual
[8:13:08] <Sielas> @waifoong98 just saying it's the handwaving available in that situation
[8:13:09] <EASrake> @gunsrlove yeah but make it faster tho
[8:13:15] <gunsrlove> they should
[8:13:21] <%Rezca> bit off more than he could chew
[8:13:24] <MONSTR_UwU> with these types of games i always worry about power creep
[8:13:26] <Fabric_tester> The overheat is a stupid mechanic
[8:13:26] <xmetalicdemonx> I mean that goes without saying.
[8:13:28] <+ThusTerribly> They literally said that hub sprinting would be available
[8:13:38] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus just get the items to stop the enemies and look at the numders the devastator does to the boss
[8:13:43] <Kurodius> is there any way I can runback my pick of the interceptor as my second suit?
[8:13:45] <gunsrlove> which kind of sprinting
[8:13:49] <Kurodius> oh wait
[8:13:52] <gunsrlove> the one in this demo or a better one
[8:13:55] <Kurodius> there is an update happening
[8:14:11] <mongol_800> Has the "special event" started?
[8:14:11] <%Rezca> does the mech he's using just not have a fourth ability?
[8:14:19] <Kurodius> seems like they may have patched the demo
[8:14:22] <+ThusTerribly> considering that there isn't a sprint in the demo, probably better than what you're saying lul
[8:14:24] <+vinnysuperg123> Is this game super unoptimized cause the framerate looks inconsistant
[8:14:24] <@Solidus_113> woolieS woolieT
[8:14:25] <@Solidus_113> woolieF woolieU
[8:14:41] <sileo_patronus> DoTs being able to kill in a game like this is never fun
[8:15:09] <gunsrlove> i think it's a cinematic 30fps on consoles. Could be very wrong
[8:15:12] <EASrake> Can dots kill? It's only ever taken me to low health.
[8:15:13] <mongol_800> Spin 2 Win Woolz!
[8:15:20] <Baconrath> lytUSEGUN do you get a gun that shoots swords
[8:15:33] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus use Interceptor ult to pick up you can not die
[8:15:58] <+ThusTerribly> I don't think dots kill. I usually play at very low health as Colossus and I've never actually been downed by a fire or acid dot
[8:16:10] <+Irridium> they try to hit 30fps on consoles. And on the pro and x they get there. usually. base consoles are, well... on xbone I can tell you it's an uber cinematic 20 fps
[8:16:10] <sileo_patronus> good
[8:16:13] <EASrake> same
[8:16:41] <EASrake> Granted if you got hit with another dot it would probably kill
[8:16:52] <Sielas> It's so unclear what's hitting you and how/if you should be avoiding it
[8:17:10] <+gantz_zero> you will keep getting shocked so you're overheated because you need to defend this platform @WoolieVersus
[8:17:13] <Sielas> since all the hits look like hitscan
[8:17:19] <+ThusTerribly> If the big electrical clouds aren't a giveaway, yeah it's confusing
[8:17:34] <+Axellogic> The thunder orbs that appear instantly overheat you
[8:17:37] <zaptar13> So is this game just poorly optimized or were they too ambitious?
[8:17:58] <Sielas> @ThusTerribly that would be a point if there wasn't tons of random visual clutter
[8:18:02] <EASrake> I'm gonna go with poorly optimized atm
[8:18:14] <EASrake> we will see at launce
[8:18:19] <+ThusTerribly> There's literally no enemies firing though, man
[8:18:20] <Kurodius> it is kinda brand new
[8:18:21] <Baconrath> im just gonna go ahead and blame upper management
[8:18:21] <sileo_patronus> They made the mistake of releasing a prior build as a demo
[8:18:36] <Kurodius> bad optimization for a psudo-mmo is kinda expected
[8:18:37] <ValentineHearts> The games best selling point is the customization though. thats one thing That I can't really find fault in
[8:18:53] <+thecosmicfly> That's true
[8:18:54] <gunsrlove> customisation is nice
[8:19:01] <lostysama> Damn! Woolie still streaming????
[8:19:04] <sileo_patronus> The biggest issue I'm having is the sound design for the weapons
[8:19:12] <Kurodius> yes
[8:19:12] <@Solidus_113> everyone wants their pretty colourful dolls
[8:19:14] <sileo_patronus> Everything sounds really flimsy
[8:19:16] <xmetalicdemonx> the characters do look cool.
[8:19:19] <Kurodius> Guns feel bad to shoot
[8:19:20] <EASrake> I will be interested in seeing how customization developes after launch
[8:19:21] <+ThusTerribly> The sound is real fucked for the demo on PC, gotta admit. Audio cuts out constantly
[8:19:31] <EASrake> Cuz that is what's gonna keep this game alive
[8:19:34] <Kurodius> they have no good pop to them, not even the shotguns
[8:19:48] <Bennett_Fracture> early bird special...
[8:19:52] <ValentineHearts> Like its an EA they love corporate meddling so I straight up would be a little hesitant to push any fault for certain problems on them w/o more info on it
[8:19:57] <Bennett_Fracture> or late night snack...
[8:20:01] <ValentineHearts> on the devs
[8:20:01] <gunsrlove> im holding off on buyin it, for now, since it seems like a very short term investment. PLus i want to see hjow much content is actually in there
[8:20:07] <EASrake> Sound is absolutly fucked, Its an issue with the frostbyte engine iirc
[8:20:10] <+gantz_zero> loads a money
[8:20:14] <+ThusTerribly> Considering there is a newer build, I would say it's probably EA pushing out a demo asap
[8:20:23] <gunsrlove> I don't want it to be a Destiny situation, oif beat story and drop
[8:20:54] <zaptar13> Is the flying fun to do?
[8:21:05] <+gantz_zero> what's wrong with a video game being that @gunsrlove
[8:21:19] <+Irridium> it is but the overheat bar limits it
[8:21:28] <gunsrlove> they're trying to be a long term years long mmo
[8:21:32] <gunsrlove> but also
[8:21:37] <%TeethMuncher> @zaptar13 not on mouse and keyboard, at least from the hour I played
[8:21:37] <+SuichiTanaka> The colors and lighting is visual confusing
[8:21:39] <Bennett_Fracture> i can't seem to be able to find the episode in which woolie plays monster hunter world...
[8:21:41] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus use the devastator it can get criticals bosses weak points
[8:21:48] <+ThusTerribly> flying in rain/around water will cool you and keep you from overheating for a real long time
[8:21:48] <SGrim> Is Woolie blinder than Paige? PogChamp
[8:21:51] <gunsrlove> it's too AAA fro that(big flashy, short term investment)
[8:21:51] <ValentineHearts> Nothing Gants, I mean undertale is like an 8-10 hour game and totally worth 20 dollars, but its a long term MMO, and has to be held to those standards
[8:21:55] <gunsrlove> Also if people drop it
[8:22:00] <mongol_800> Time for struggles woolz! Muahahah!
[8:22:03] <gunsrlove> BioWare is off to the FIFA mines
[8:22:10] <+gantz_zero> just come back when there's more things to do imo @gunsrlove nothing is worth playing constantly
[8:22:30] <Sielas> Hey, I know that Zerg
[8:22:35] <+thecosmicfly> The dreaded scrote spider
[8:22:36] <zamzoph> Is this a Lost Planet boss?
[8:22:39] <+BigBoiChavo> is this on PC or what?
[8:22:42] <goroke> the four glowing points????
[8:22:42] <gunsrlove> ps4
[8:22:43] <EASrake> The fleshy parts
[8:22:45] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus its ass
[8:22:46] <Arweynn> glowies and butt
[8:22:46] <+gantz_zero> the giant glowing parts are weak @WoolieVersus
[8:22:49] <+Axellogic> The giant red spots and the butt are the weak part
[8:22:56] <+ThusTerribly> The big fleshy bits are the weak point, you just couldn't damage him cause he was doing his big dramatic animation to spawn in
[8:22:57] <sileo_patronus> Looks like the giant fleshy bulbs are the target of choice
[8:23:10] <Fabric_tester> The big glowing ball sack in her back
[8:23:17] <ValentineHearts> Ah, big glowy weak points.
[8:23:18] <+MrIntake> LUL
[8:23:18] <Baconrath> lets beyblaaaade
[8:23:20] <ValentineHearts> Also owned
[8:23:21] <+TaifuDragon> LOL
[8:23:24] <+Mvrdok_> LUL
[8:23:26] <+ThusTerribly> was that a oneshot on normal difficulty
[8:23:28] <+thecosmicfly> LET A RIP
[8:23:29] <+ThusTerribly> interceptor YIKES
[8:23:35] <+gantz_zero> her stomp is too strong for interceptor to survive @WoolieVersus
[8:23:40] <gunsrlove> it;s a looter shooter @gantz_zero . It's supposed to be played constantly\
[8:23:41] <sileo_patronus> Can you escape just before your ult runs out?
[8:23:43] <SGrim> @WoolieVersus that's why you leave BEFORE the Ult ends
[8:23:53] <ImNotDeluxee> chat, what's YOUR favorite javeline!?
[8:24:01] <gunsrlove> Unless it is supposed to be a big mutliplayer Narrative experience
[8:24:04] <mongol_800> yup, Interceptor can't do much in this fight sadly
[8:24:05] <uberhox> that's woolie skin LUL
[8:24:07] <ValentineHearts> Trinity Prime.
[8:24:09] <gunsrlove> which doesnt seems to be the case
[8:24:15] <+ThusTerribly> But the game is more like diablo than destiny, tho
[8:24:20] <Fabric_tester> Inaros
[8:24:25] <gunsrlove> Better than Desitny
[8:24:32] <Sielas> that's a low bar
[8:24:33] <gunsrlove> destiny*
[8:24:34] <sileo_patronus> The boss, gotta keep an eye on the boss
[8:24:36] <gunsrlove> density
[8:24:36] <SGrim> @ThusTerribly nice bait
[8:24:44] <+gantz_zero> it's totally Diablo @ThusTerribly
[8:24:47] <+ThusTerribly> but it's true, tho. Weapons are secondary to abilities
[8:24:49] <EASrake> game looks like game LUL
[8:24:55] <ValentineHearts> ok but better than destiny is a pretty low bar.
[8:25:04] <+ThusTerribly> Being a shooter doesn't make it more like destiny than diablo
[8:25:05] <MonstarGrrrl> thats a big ass
[8:25:16] <Bennett_Fracture> starship troopers was a good movie...
[8:25:24] <mongol_800> OR maybe no AMMO
[8:25:26] <+cassiemillion> So is this a buggy mess then?
[8:25:27] <mongol_800> LUL
[8:25:28] <+Axellogic> Woolie use your abilities they will do way more damage
[8:25:31] <Shisno27> starship troopers was a good book
[8:25:39] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus run when the yellow bar is almost empty
[8:25:47] <ValentineHearts> Throw shurikens right in the B-hole
[8:25:47] <EASrake> the adds give ammo PogChamp
[8:25:49] <Bennett_Fracture> and i need to catch up on my reading...
[8:26:11] <sileo_patronus> I should get back to warframe, I was shooting to finally get excalibur
[8:26:17] <+gantz_zero> it hurts seeing him snipe her face
[8:26:19] <MonstarGrrrl> NotLikeThis
[8:26:21] <zaptar13> This feels like a very safe by the numbers kind of game.
[8:26:26] <+gantz_zero> you can do THOUSANDS of damage per shot
[8:26:31] <@Solidus_113> woolieREMEMBERS woolieREMEMBERS woolieREMEMBERS
[8:26:32] <+gantz_zero> with the devestator
[8:26:33] <+phatmac16> This looks cool
[8:26:47] <+thecosmicfly> What goes first kirby or the dualshock
[8:26:50] <Sielas> Is Woolz on PC with controller or PS4
[8:27:01] <ValentineHearts> Hes on ps4
[8:27:01] <+thecosmicfly> Ps4
[8:27:16] <The_Lady_Alustriel> Interceptor can also freeze with a specific shuriken
[8:27:35] <zaptar13> I thought this was an xbone game
[8:27:38] <+ThusTerribly> I think every class has access to every elemental primer, but I'm not 100% on that
[8:27:38] <WeedSpagon> Are those crabs or spiders
[8:27:44] <Sielas> Zerg
[8:27:48] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus hit the sides with the devastator not the front
[8:27:49] <+thecosmicfly> Spabs
[8:27:49] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus If someone freezes and you melee the frozen target, you get a frozen combo that gives you an aura that makes your melee attacks freeze
[8:27:49] <ValentineHearts> Its an every platform game
[8:27:57] <The_Lady_Alustriel> Yeah I'd imagine every suit can, but I don't know
[8:28:03] <zaptar13> @weedspagon arachnids. So both.
[8:28:04] <+gantz_zero> ps4,bone,pc @zaptar13
[8:28:27] <+ThusTerribly> I know Colossus has lightning, acid, and fire at the very least even though fire's drop rate is non-existent for me ;-;
[8:28:50] <ValentineHearts> heck ya shurikened that B-hole
[8:28:57] <The_Lady_Alustriel> Thats me with the freezing shuriken lol, can't get it to drop
[8:29:01] <+gantz_zero> @The_Lady_Alustriel Storm just comes with ice shots right from unlock
[8:29:01] <+thursdaySG> is this a woolie themed frame paintjob or an eva 01 frame paintjob
[8:29:04] <mongol_800> @WoolieVersus Kill some frozen adds and get ice power to your melee!!
[8:29:04] <+thursdaySG> cause I can def see both
[8:29:10] <Bennett_Fracture> i'll buy the definitive edition next year if it's on sale on some holiday...
[8:29:11] <SpoonJuggler> This looks like a bigger budget, non-campy EDF
[8:29:12] <Bennett_Fracture> lets say... earth day...
[8:29:19] <The_Lady_Alustriel> @gantz_zero ye and lighting, other classes have to gear for it
[8:29:20] <Baconrath> machine pistols are fuckin cool tho
[8:29:31] <+ThusTerribly> But yeah, people saying this is more like destiny than diablo aren't spamming their abilities nearly enough. Guns should be your backup, abilities are disgustingly strong
[8:29:48] <ValentineHearts> Its no EDF, the scale of the enemies is nothing in comparison and the teamwork isn't quite as vital (from what ive seen on the last part)
[8:30:04] <ValentineHearts> And you seem stronger as individuals than i ever felt i edf
[8:30:11] <+Axellogic> I use uts mostly for healing
[8:30:12] <SpoonJuggler> Just tuned in so I'm talking completely out of my ass, literally the first thing I thought of
[8:30:20] <The_Lady_Alustriel> Teamwork? You mean being Wingdiver and staying kilometres away from enemies lol
[8:30:23] <+gantz_zero> YOU SHALL NOT SPIDER
[8:30:25] <ValentineHearts> Its a fair comparison
[8:30:29] <ValentineHearts> at a glance
[8:30:46] <+gantz_zero> it's one of ignorance @cayvalentine
[8:30:53] <+gantz_zero> not trolling
[8:30:55] <ValentineHearts> hence at a glance
[8:30:56] <The_Lady_Alustriel> oh nooo
[8:30:56] <+SuichiTanaka> Oh no

[8:32:36] <Kurodius> can someone tell me if I can change my robots to the other classes?
[8:32:37] <waifoong98> @WoolieVersus take a rest and eat man, just drop this tbh
[8:32:37] <SpoonJuggler> I don't know if that happened before but I tuned in like 3 minutes ago and it all collapsed
[8:32:39] <SpoonJuggler> YEAH
[8:32:40] <T_Sasquatch> try on ps4
[8:32:43] <The_Lady_Alustriel> oh shoot hello @Elky3 chariHI
[8:32:48] <ValentineHearts> I wish it had a less broad and more focused vision for the game play, I might not feel so against it if it did, but it just bleeds Triple-A hit all the bases
[8:32:50] <zaptar13> there are better things to play
[8:32:53] <EASrake> Well lucky the game comes out in that time
[8:32:57] <+cerass> @woolieversus night woolz wish I had a chance to play with ya. yeah this pissed me off when it happened to me too lmao
[8:32:58] <mongol_800> welp.. time to close chat.
[8:32:59] <+gantz_zero> you haven't lost the progress though @WoolieVersus
[8:33:00] <T_Sasquatch> oh LUL
[8:33:03] <+Puffiest_panda> But buy our cosmetics tho
[8:33:03] <Holofono> it's ok woolie, we understand
[8:33:03] <ValentineHearts> Also crashing on the PS4
[8:33:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> damn
[8:33:07] <770megaman> Play warNUT it better
[8:33:08] <+DrunkenDice> Triple A gaming at it's finest
[8:33:09] <Bennett_Fracture> whats amphetamine...
[8:33:10] <Keiji_Maede24> damn
[8:33:14] <+MrIntake> what sucks is that when you reconnect you are locked out of the boss fight on pc. sucks HUGE
[8:33:16] <+Elky3> Fellow weeb @The_Lady_Alustriel chariOMG
[8:33:17] <max_radical> https://clips.twitch.tv/FineTriumphantPenguinDuDudu
[8:33:20] <gunsrlove> try on pc then LUL
[8:33:23] <Baconrath> its like the P2P connections in the Transformers games lytBODIED
[8:33:27] <+Axellogic> Honestly the PS4 version seemed way more unstable to me
[8:33:28] <SpoonJuggler> TRIPLE EYYY GAMING
[8:33:31] <+Puffiest_panda> don't you want to buy cosmetics tho
[8:33:32] <+phatmac16> Go to sleep
[8:33:33] <+ThusTerribly> I've been super lucky and only DCd twice on PC in my entire time, but this mission has had both of them so idk what's going on
[8:33:35] <mongol_800> Try the Linux version tho
[8:33:35] <gunsrlove> you dont keep the levels from the demo anyway
[8:33:36] <+Axellogic> No you keep you inventory
[8:33:36] <ImNotDeluxee> just play xbox LUL
[8:33:38] <+Lixagon> S L E E P
[8:33:40] <sileo_patronus> This is why I prefer shorter, more dense missions in these games
[8:33:43] <laguerrilha> Had the same experience with Vermitide 2 today. Lost connection on the reward part after 30m games
[8:33:46] <+Irridium> xbox is just as bad
[8:33:47] <+Axellogic> but you cant redeem them til you finish a mission
[8:33:50] <zamzoph> we know it
[8:33:57] <770megaman> Waht about the SWISH version?!.
[8:34:02] <+Axellogic> So progress isnt lost
[8:34:03] <ImNotDeluxee> xbox lowkey worse
[8:34:05] <The_Lady_Alustriel> @laguerrilha oh damn that's awful. Worse in Vermintide for sure
[8:34:09] <+mechslayer71> How did he like interceptor? I went to sleep
[8:34:10] <+Irridium> not wrong
[8:34:14] <vellas2009> @woolieversus if you go into freeplay and leave it will give you what you had earned from the stronghold
[8:34:20] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus quit game and restart and no you will get a in game mail with the exp
[8:34:21] <+cerass> @woolieversus I actually kept my leveling progress when it happened to me @woolieversus
[8:34:25] <Holofono> corrupted save = worst feeling in the world
[8:34:26] <Rhinoprotoss> That sounds like you were dumb
[8:34:28] <The_Lady_Alustriel> he can't even connect tho
[8:34:38] <+cerass> wow I'm tired lmao
[8:34:47] <Bennett_Fracture> i dont think i have bad karma too...
[8:34:51] <The_Lady_Alustriel> I wish I knew all of this yesterday
[8:34:53] <ImNotDeluxee> it's 5:24 am for me lesgo
[8:35:02] <+Axellogic> Youll see the items in your inventory
[8:35:02] <+MrIntake> its still ruins the fun
[8:35:03] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus happened alot to me
[8:35:07] <mongol_800> @WoolieVersus Crashes and Bugs aside tho.. u had fun?
[8:35:07] <+ThusTerribly> I think keeping exp is hit or miss, but you def keep gear you looted
[8:35:12] <+Axellogic> but they'ree still mysterious items
[8:35:15] <+phatmac16> Stop Woolie
[8:35:18] <+TaifuDragon> @WoolieVersus yeah it sucks man we all had the same issue with this boss
[8:35:19] <T_Sasquatch> !uptime
[8:35:26] <xmetalicdemonx> Was the game fun to play?
[8:35:27] <+Puffiest_panda> Just play warframe lol
[8:35:31] <The_Lady_Alustriel> Interceptor is so much more fun than the others lol
[8:35:33] <T_Sasquatch> fuck warframe
[8:35:36] <%SuckerPunchSyd> wind taken right out of the sails with that crash
[8:35:39] <+Puffiest_panda> if you want that type of gameplay
[8:35:41] <%Rivalshotzgp> Warframe is better in my opinion
[8:35:41] <EASrake> oooh this suit. RICH CORINTHIAN LEATHER
[8:35:43] <+SuichiTanaka> Woolie really wants Warframe.
[8:35:45] <gunsrlove> just play warframe lol
[8:35:49] <viciousgrim> its fun but not a needed game
[8:35:51] <SpoonJuggler> Yeah, was gonna say that if you'd have to choose, just play warframe
[8:35:52] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Man, this crap can be a real mood & hype killer if it hits at the wrong time
[8:35:53] <+ThusTerribly> Warframe is a very different game tho
[8:35:57] <The_Lady_Alustriel> @Puffiest_panda not at all comparable and I have hundreds of hours in warframe
[8:36:02] <beelsebozz> it's a demo man chill out
[8:36:03] <gunsrlove> it is different
[8:36:03] <sileo_patronus> Yeah I'd wait for reception of the full version
[8:36:04] <Shisno27> if only warframe was good
[8:36:05] <gunsrlove> yes
[8:36:07] <xmetalicdemonx> Well no game is needed.
[8:36:07] <Fabric_tester> The Interceptor is closer to warframe than the others
[8:36:09] <+thecosmicfly> Chat shilling hard for Warframe
[8:36:10] <gunsrlove> but regardless
[8:36:12] <mongol_800> he's not gonna like WF i feel.. too grindy
[8:36:12] <$TIME_PUNCHER> "Promise nothing, deliver Anthem"
[8:36:13] <%GarbageNirvana> This had better be leading to better connections for the full game
[8:36:15] <+Irridium> Devil May Cry 5 demo comes out soon so there's that
[8:36:16] <gunsrlove> just play warframe
[8:36:16] <+Puffiest_panda> He said what he liked was the playstyle of the last suit
[8:36:17] <waifoong98> Just go eat and rest man
[8:36:19] <+gantz_zero> you had fun though @WoolieVersus
[8:36:20] <+phatmac16> We love you
[8:36:20] <Bennett_Fracture> you are way too much flustered for a press conference woolie...
[8:36:21] <+MrIntake> they said there is only 3 strongholds and missions.so its just a grind OMEGALUL

[8:38:18] <+Axellogic> They better how the tech stuff is ironed out
[8:38:31] <SpoonJuggler> So, whens anthem coming out?
[8:38:31] <@SoushinSen> Liam has a E3's preorder discount, he can get it for $40
[8:38:39] <mongol_800> Jabalins~
[8:38:42] <ValentineHearts> I got caught up playing magic with a bunch of people, game was nuts and went to almost 2
[8:38:51] <ValentineHearts> watched this on the side and stuck around
[8:38:53] <The_Lady_Alustriel> These types of games benefit from having friends who are deep into it
[8:38:55] <viciousgrim> and i like loot games poe 2k hr
[8:38:57] <gunsrlove> Animations are p good, jokes aside
[8:39:09] <SpoonJuggler> NO WAIT WAS THAT THE FULL GAME
[8:39:10] <$TIME_PUNCHER> It has the potential to incorporate some Vanquish shit, but hasn't
[8:39:18] <+ThusTerribly> no? its a demo
[8:39:22] <T_Sasquatch> frame rate is booty
[8:39:29] <SpoonJuggler> Whew, thank christ
[8:39:33] <+NiktenKing> Fix the connection issues and it might be decent side game.
[8:39:33] <gunsrlove> 30fps is no bueno
[8:39:43] <The_Lady_Alustriel> The preformance is also lackluster on PC. It's really badly optimized
[8:39:47] <Baconrath> but but but games as a service NotLikeThis
[8:39:50] <%IMDRanged> Pride and Accomplishments
[8:39:55] <EASrake> Lost progress just mean you get to play it twice tho
[8:39:59] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus it's supposedly an older build, which would be dumb if true, and dire if not
[8:40:02] <%Explodincatz> same
[8:40:03] <+Puffiest_panda> do you like 20$ cosmetics tho
[8:40:04] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Yeah, lost progress just equals wasted time and just kills it for me

[8:41:18] <waifoong98> Take a rest LUL
[8:41:20] <@Solidus_113> bring in Plague for once!
[8:41:25] <viciousgrim> the game is fun
[8:41:26] <ValentineHearts> It had fun ideas, but they just weren't enough sadly
[8:41:29] <sileo_patronus> You KNOW Pat's just gonna tell you to play Warframe
[8:41:29] <+CapraCreep> LUL
[8:41:29] <+ThusTerribly> liking anthem is verboten rip
[8:41:32] <+gantz_zero> it's a fun game and a rough demo
[8:41:35] <xmetalicdemonx> If you had fun, that's all that counts.
[8:41:36] <Shisno27> you were WRONG TO HAVE FUN
[8:41:42] <mongol_800> OH boy! YOu're gonna have the TOXIC-est chat on Anthem on that Podcast!
[8:41:44] <EASrake> its an okay issue that has a lot of problems at the moment
[8:41:44] <Klarrann3> Get ready for Pat to tell you to play warframe instead
[8:41:49] <$Chatterbox1991> Welcome to being a Bioware fan Woolie :)
[8:41:57] <EASrake> game*
[8:42:00] <The_Lady_Alustriel> @Chatterbox1991 too true
[8:42:04] <+gantz_zero> pat is full of shit the video was faked @WoolieVersus
[8:42:13] <The_Lady_Alustriel> How DARE you enjoy any late Bioware titles
[8:42:14] <SpoonJuggler> I didn't hate it just by watching, would need to play it myself to comment further
[8:42:16] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Nah, I know people who would prefer Anthem over Warframe, it's just subjective tastes
[8:42:21] <+gantz_zero> he claims that gameplay trailer was fabricated
[8:42:24] <+SuichiTanaka> It's just a 5/10, which is the worst thing it could be
[8:42:26] <gunsrlove> There is good stuff there
[8:42:35] <SwindlerOfProgress> Personally, I just thought it looked bland.
[8:42:36] <$Chatterbox1991> Loving Inquisition was ROUGH for a while
[8:42:36] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus Ima be real, I'm likely to trudge through this game with it's bugs then go back to warframe
[8:42:38] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Rock what rocks you, not what rocks others.
[8:42:41] <SGrim> The online is a complete fucking trainwreck. The actual game is fine.
[8:42:42] <+ThusTerribly> I'm MR24 in warframe and prefer Anthem, even with the issues. I just hope they tighten up the servers.
[8:42:42] <$Chatterbox1991> because people are mean
[8:42:43] <mongol_800> Liking Anthem is not cool with the kidz right now Woolz
[8:42:43] <Fabric_tester> I mean the flying does suck, that overheat is anti-fun
[8:42:44] <gunsrlove> The original gameplay trailer was fake as shit
[8:42:46] <MForan98> I can't stand warframe
[8:42:49] <+Puffiest_panda> It'll be ruined, they'll find a way. Just wait
[8:42:50] <Bennett_Fracture> as a entertainer... yeah...
[8:42:56] <ValentineHearts> Yeah nah anywone who says its total garbage is full of shit, worse its just an ok 6/10
[8:42:58] <viciousgrim> it is a cookie cutter game but has good game play
[8:42:58] <%SuckerPunchSyd> thats what fallout 76 is for
[8:42:59] <+NiktenKing> Plague said the feel of the game is alright. It's just you need to fine tune the controls and hopefully fix the connection issues.
[8:43:00] <+phatmac16> It seems decent
[8:43:02] <EASrake> I am burned the fuck out of warrame and enjoy the change in pace that anthem offers
[8:43:05] <Bennett_Fracture> but as a gamer... no need for it woolie...
[8:43:09] <T_Sasquatch> lets be real tho , the same problems that occured in destiny , warframe , the division will most likely happen
[8:43:09] <zamzoph> ah yes, the crowbcat method
[8:43:12] <sileo_patronus> @MForan98 completely fair
[8:43:16] <$TIME_PUNCHER> @ThusTerribly Christ, MR24? I feel wiped at MR13
[8:43:24] <+gantz_zero> people are whiners
[8:43:31] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> I feel like it being a EA game is a big part of it
[8:43:33] <mongol_800> Fuck those people Woolz
[8:43:34] <The_Lady_Alustriel> @ThusTerribly I'm MR 18 with hundreds of hours and I'm enjoying the crap outta Anthem. It's a completely different game
[8:43:35] <$Chatterbox1991> EXACTLTY
[8:43:39] <+ThusTerribly> @TIME_PUNCHER Yeah it's not a good grind.
[8:43:45] <SwindlerOfProgress> @LORDSPOOKLEKINS Pretty much
[8:43:45] <EASrake> dude i know its infuriating. Because the game is fun despite its glaring issues
[8:43:46] <+phatmac16> They're trolls
[8:43:47] <$Chatterbox1991> THIS IS WHY BEING A BIOWARE FAN SUCKS NOW
[8:43:48] <%Rivalshotzgp> This game feels a LOT like Adromeda
[8:43:48] <Zellris> bigest problem seems to be that its unstable
[8:43:53] <mongol_800> The EA hate bandwagon is massive
[8:43:54] <+Puffiest_panda> EA has just left a really bad taste in our moths
[8:43:54] <Baconrath> Before You Buy Kappa
[8:43:56] <+gantz_zero> trolls rule the internet @WoolieVersus
[8:43:59] <+MrIntake> i enjoy it i just hope it doesnt do this when it comes out
[8:43:59] <+Noponiz> good on you
[8:44:02] <+phatmac16> We get you
[8:44:05] <The_Lady_Alustriel> I enjoyed Dragon Age Inquisition and got bombed for it
[8:44:06] <SpoonJuggler> Judge the game by it's own merits when it comes out, even though EA is the devil and bioware a former shell of itself
[8:44:08] <$TIME_PUNCHER> I think once you hit MR14-16 you stop worrying about grinding MR
[8:44:10] <s0nata_ii> It's a Bioware EA game it's only fair to assume it's shit
[8:44:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> The pc demo was a also a disaster
[8:44:13] <+Irridium> game's really not that bad. Not all that great but it's not bad by any stretch of the imagination. if they can fix the fucked problems it might actually be good
[8:44:13] <+ThusTerribly> @The_Lady_Alustriel Yeah, I don't see the comparisons tbh. It's a completely different feel and setup and it's nice.
[8:44:20] <$Chatterbox1991> @The_Lady_Alustriel exactly
[8:44:23] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Most, if not all, shit is unlocked at that point
[8:44:25] <Bennett_Fracture> review on the run featuring woolie madden football 2k3 on the x-box...
[8:44:26] <+Elky3> As a person who mainly Plays Destiny, I like it but I Feel like EA is gonna fk it up chariSIP
[8:44:27] <hntronium> Good on you Woolie, you have your opinions and they have theirs
[8:44:29] <sileo_patronus> I'm probably gonna skip this game cause of a number of small things
[8:44:33] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus bring Plague on for the podcast so it's not a one-sided debate
[8:44:34] <+phatmac16> Everyone hates EA
[8:44:34] <EASrake> Haters will say i'm a corporate shill Kappa
[8:44:35] <Baconrath> its got teething troubles
[8:44:40] <+mcjimbles> All aboard the hate train baby!
[8:44:42] <%SuckerPunchSyd> small issues add up
[8:44:45] <+SuichiTanaka> DA:I is fun. It's just not DA:O and that is apparently unacceptable to everyone.
