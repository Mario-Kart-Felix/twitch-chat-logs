[0:01:33] <%Vextalyst> cheer500 Yo Woolie I honestly feel Kaine's Monologue in the original Nier is the greatest line read in all of videogames. My fear of the remake losing the magic of the original's voiceacting has been put to rest in the latest trailer. I'd like to know what you'd list as ur top videogame line read.
[0:01:52] <brachydios777> Why you gotta be like that with subtitles Japan?
[0:01:58] <%0rond> oh no
[0:02:02] <%0rond> I asked the same question later
[0:02:05] <derap41> how to make sure he never plays ti
[0:02:05] <syncronard> is Neir good?
[0:02:13] <dds333a> It's just the process of revisions, it's how it is
[0:02:13] <%Irridium> SHIN final
[0:02:17] <+tussletoes> Nier is great
[0:02:18] <%0rond> sorry
[0:02:18] <DedlokPM> @syncronard Yes
[0:02:28] <Draleokong> Woolie did you hear about the first Main Jojo Milf Villain?
[0:02:31] <@Solidus_113> Apparently the PC port is trash
[0:02:32] <leith_aziz> @megadblitz: Hope you enjoy it nicobWave
[0:02:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I'm glad new people will be experiencing it
[0:02:42] <brachydios777> Now it has the good gameplay
[0:02:43] <%chrisarithmetic> it was fine
[0:02:45] <%0rond> @Solidus_113 as is tradition
[0:02:45] <dds333a> A serviceable package
[0:02:51] <leith_aziz> Gameplay of Nier seems to drag it down from what I hear
[0:02:51] <waffleandman> rip Papa Nier
[0:02:52] <syncronard> like drakengard then
[0:02:54] <%Irridium> it was okay
[0:03:00] <dds333a> It really wasn't too bad, it just had issues
[0:03:10] <%livlinn> daddy Nier... shiaCry
[0:03:24] <leith_aziz> Seems like a match made in heaven
[0:03:27] <2deep5u> now if only drakengard 1 got the same treatment
[0:03:30] <Sartastic> Papa Nier with a phat robot ass
[0:03:40] <dds333a> Yeah, just some extra panache
[0:04:02] <+cubbywolf> too bad nier takes 10 hours to get good
[0:04:06] <%livlinn> also I'm not really a fan of remake Kaine??
[0:04:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> I want all commitment and no pay off
[0:04:10] <brachydios777> I know papa nier is an extra mode in Replicant, but I hope we can have papa nier version in the future
[0:04:17] <therealtacopancakes> reggie wants more souls, I can sense it
[0:04:23] <leith_aziz> As someone who never played the Nier games, I get how "papa Nier" was a thing in the west, but how does the plot work around that? Is the script completely different?
[0:04:25] <dds333a> @livelinne agreed
[0:04:42] <penitentpendant> @brachydios777 Bonus points if he shows up at the end of MSQ as another character
[0:04:46] <+cubbywolf> reggie needs to do 1 2 3 ds time
[0:04:48] <%emperordread> It's like the cock carousel, gotta keep moving round. Can't stay on one for too long

[0:49:06] <+cubbywolf> damnit my cat discconnected my internet

[0:50:52] <CappuccinoGuil> @SuckerPunchSyd It gets worse: "When it‚Äôs quiet, ears will adapt. The quieter the room, the more things you hear. You‚Äôll hear your heart beating, sometimes you can hear your lungs, hear your stomach gurgling loudly. In the anechoic chamber, you become the sound.""

[2:21:33] <+QueequegTheater> But I heard QA weren't devs Kappa
[2:21:34] <%ChoculaUltra> Josef Fares definitely shot up my list of cool devs in the biz
[2:21:34] <%kyh9> Fares is such a good guy
[2:21:35] <leith_aziz> Levels were very unique. I was impressed
[2:21:37] <AsinPersuasion> so this vs way out, what wins
[2:21:38] <+cubbywolf> too long imo
[2:21:39] <+relentingapunch> Holy shit ALL THE LOCALIZERS
[2:21:45] <%livlinn> amazing game, lukewarm message
[2:21:46] <StebTheVee> Has there been a BAD level in the game?
[2:21:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Josef Fares is what David Cage fails to be. An actual movie director and an actual game developer.
[2:21:51] <Jashter18> So does this mean Josef is batting 3/3 now on good games?
[2:21:54] <Fleet_Admiral_Sakazuki> @WoolieVersus the real question is who's fault is it
[2:22:02] <+Walopoh> It was a LOOOOOONG game
[2:22:03] <%jepupu> The snow zone and swimming ones were meh.
[2:22:03] <+relentingapunch> Josef is 3/3 rn
[2:22:05] <brachydios777> Farres 3 for 3
[2:22:07] <%ChoculaUltra> 3 for 3 indeed.
[2:22:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli FAX
[2:22:07] <+Walopoh> way more than expected
[2:22:09] <%jepupu> The squirrel/bee feud one was great.
[2:22:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Solid 3/3 for Josef
[2:22:12] <@Solidus_113> he don't miss
[2:22:14] <+Mrbaconator> josef farris is GREAT
[2:22:18] <$eco419> Woolie x Reggie thx game you saved them
[2:22:20] <%megadblitz> fuck the book tho don't forget
[2:22:24] <%fetrigon> 3/3
[2:22:36] <AsinPersuasion> how long will the next josef fares game be though? 20 hours?
[2:22:38] <AsinPersuasion> too long?
[2:22:40] <Darren716> Sooooo, infinite chess now?
[2:22:41] <VritraReiRei> some of levels went on for waaayyyy longer then they should have
[2:22:45] <leith_aziz> ok, I think I'll give the guy credit now.
[2:22:45] <%SirGO0SE> if too much woahment there is noment

[2:22:54] <%gatorafan> This feels like the better game but A Way Out had the better story. (I think, speaking out of memory)
[2:22:57] <masterfire23> the book is trash

[2:27:11] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:27:15] <$eco419> LUL LUL
[2:27:16] <MyNameIsRasus> To be fair, they were divorcing for some stupid shit
[2:27:18] <Blank9> sometimes it is that simple
[2:27:19] <marshalmorphino22> Oh nooooo
[2:27:29] <+cubbywolf> one goes in for the kiss and the other pushes away
[2:27:37] <%ChoculaUltra> FeelsBadMan
[2:27:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie let someone have a happy ending for once LUL
[2:27:40] <%omegafree13> @MyNameIsRasus was the reason ever fully stated?
[2:27:45] <+cubbywolf> and they miss the note the kid left
[2:27:47] <leith_aziz> To be fair, they didnt straight up say they'll be back together
[2:27:54] <%ChoculaUltra> Ending D
[2:27:55] <marshalmorphino22> I wonder if this game saved any marriages?
[2:27:57] <CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, I feel like the story was too idealistic for the subject matter
[2:28:00] <Broand> DL:C
[2:28:03] <brachydios777> Remember, there are no happy endings in real life
[2:28:04] <%gitgouda> lol end of game. surprise lil timmy were getting a divorce
[2:28:09] <Broand> Divorce DLC
[2:28:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nah happy ending are better
[2:28:14] <MyNameIsRasus> @omegafree13 no, it was implied to be a cumulative of all the things they say in game, and if it is, it's absolutely salvageable
[2:28:15] <$eco419> Real ending unlocked
[2:28:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DLC for Divorce
[2:28:20] <+cubbywolf> they get into a big fight after waking up and never read the note in time
[2:28:21] <+Jiggisnipe> turns into Moving Out
[2:28:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Pay more for divorce DLC
[2:28:24] <Blank9> not every single marriage story has to be sad and divorce
[2:28:25] <+Walopoh> Maybe the point is that it didn't fix their marriage but the spark was reignited
[2:28:25] <%Calenrow> Bonus level: "You get Twice the presents at Christmas"
[2:28:25] <marshalmorphino22> Play separate levels with mom and dad.
[2:28:30] <Jaysky> Have them sort through stuff with her singing at the end
[2:28:32] <VritraReiRei> Divorce Locked Content
[2:28:34] <%gatorafan> FT10 for the child
[2:28:34] <Broand> The DLC where Codys new girlfriend is playable
[2:28:37] <+QueequegTheater> video game
[2:28:37] <Mirakei> Bonus chapter: Split the items from the house into two different trucks
[2:28:47] <leith_aziz> There's nothing wrong with a game being too uplifting, despite how unrealistic it may be. See it more as how things hsould be, thats my say
[2:28:50] <DSD24> Rage!
[2:28:58] <marshalmorphino22> How about he cleans up his act and she lightens up?
[2:29:05] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:29:10] <brunoberserk> YESSSS

[2:29:26] <$arcielardor> DLC: It takes three, The couple try NTR

[2:31:48] <+cubbywolf> shogi is that similiar outside the pieces
[2:31:49] <Daxalog> its chess but you get your pieces back. Its more strategy focused.
[2:31:51] <%nintega010> ive played go. not hard to understand, but hard to master
