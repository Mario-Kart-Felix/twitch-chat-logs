[0:03:35] <Equirah> yeah, get that one
[0:03:39] <Estwilde> I've been trying to make sure I change a couple specific pieces of armor before I go back to cities in 14, but I personally don't care if I saw it or not
[0:03:40] <%Juriasu> I think pixel remaster would probably be the best version to play
[0:03:47] <%leith_aziz> @andre11dr Oh sorry, I missread it. I thought you meant romantically. I appreciate the gesture
[0:03:53] <%Juriasu> the music for the pixel remasters have been great so far imo
[0:04:01] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus PR has been giving the bangest of arrangements for all titles
[0:04:09] <%Juriasu> play the snes version if you want to be pure Woolie
[0:04:10] <%Shad0wTag> Did the DS have a FF6 release chat?
[0:04:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @born_2_late if you multiply how long it should take by like 3, you'll about have it lul

[1:29:38] <TreeLeafBoi> reggie is out ofit lmao
[1:29:41] <andre11dr> @flunkorg Reggie is slowly becoming one of the dregs from DS3 DLC LUL
[1:29:48] <%guiltyboya> Damn, I love that shopkeeper
[1:29:58] <%guiltyboya> (reminds me of an ex)
[1:29:58] <Picosunloaded> Damn Reggie don't give up hope
[1:29:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:30:02] <+Flunkorg> @andre11dr His trying to get to patches end quest the hard way
[1:30:04] <%dds333a> got the money for it? LUL
[1:30:28] <morningmoondude> In the sigma minhset, you don't let the dice roll for you, you decide how many spaces you move.
[1:30:31] <%dds333a> He's making a dash for Rabble
[1:30:38] <TreeLeafBoi> @morningmoondude lol
[1:30:53] <@Menitta> Work happened. what'd I miss
[1:31:01] <%Shad0wTag> @morningmoondude make it a book
[1:31:05] <+Flunkorg> @Menitta Reggie
[1:31:08] <+pingu_crimson> just get a roadblock rock lmao
[1:31:22] <Hammatime8> They HAVE to kill Minh
[1:31:39] <%dds333a> Woolie LUL
[1:31:42] <andre11dr> @menitta Woolie got another AT ring and Reggie is triple hollow because Minh killed him
[1:31:47] <%topendbuzza> rip lem
[1:31:49] <glass_marcus> these late game monsters are bunch of wimps
[1:31:53] <Hammatime8> @Menitta Reggie got another bounty and Minh killed him for it
[1:31:57] <Solidnick18> woolie is getting pain memories
[1:32:00] <FlowLethal> they are overleveled
[1:32:05] <glass_marcus> the mid game monsters would have reset the towns 3 times by now
[1:32:05] <%Fetrigon> @srgoatz stress clouds his judgement. I don't know how it works. My current theory is that it forces him to choose strategies that covers the most perceived weaknesses.
[1:32:14] <+Flunkorg> @Hammatime8 I'm pretty sure its taking all of reggies will power to not do that on streazm
[1:32:31] <%dds333a> @glass_marcus 5he only monsters thay stand a chance are in Rabble because they are hugely overleveled
[1:32:36] <Hammatime8> @Hammatime8 LUL
[1:32:40] <Solidnick18> The devil
[1:32:47] <%dds333a> SATANAS
[1:32:48] <%Fetrigon> but that's just my armchair analysis LUL
[1:33:07] <+pingu_crimson> @fetrigon arm char satan?
[1:33:21] <@Menitta> OH NO
[1:33:25] <andre11dr> Honestly nothing in terms of PVE really stands a chance against them at this point
[1:33:33] <%dds333a> @pingu_crimson I saw Angel Heart, he does
[1:33:56] <andre11dr> Like they will DESTROY the final boss at this point, they're so overleveld
[1:33:59] <Hammatime8> For a second, I thought reggie was about to commit ANOTHER crime LUL
[1:33:59] <%dds333a> wow
[1:34:06] <Solidnick18> poor reggie
[1:34:07] <Qu1ckyyy> this game HATES Reggie
[1:34:08] <+Jiggisnipe> @Srgoatz Sniping with magic is alright but all it does is slow them down since you can't take weapons or items if you kill them. Also you can't move if you use field magic kinda slows you down
[1:34:12] <%dds333a> that's a first, twice in a row
[1:34:15] <Solidnick18> Lmao
[1:34:21] <+Flunkorg> Reggie is now 5 times hollow
[1:34:23] <%NahmenJayden> !REGGIE AT RISK!
[1:34:23] <%dds333a> LUL LUL

[1:34:52] <%Fetrigon> ok woolie vs minh let's go
[1:34:55] <+Jiggisnipe> start chasing
[1:35:04] <Picosunloaded> I believe in Reggie
[1:35:06] <%kewlmyc> Going all in on ReggieCoin fucking hurts
[1:35:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> cut through tmem like butter

[1:35:10] <+pingu_crimson> get the bastard woolz
[1:35:11] <Hammatime8> Weapon shop?
[1:35:32] <%SmylesonMyles> Black iron reggie
[1:35:35] <+Srgoatz> i mean, woolie and minh cashed. the. fuck. INTO their classes' strengths. reggie could have pumped speed when missing powerful spells became a factor..... but no matter...... all those moments are lost...... like...... tears
[1:36:06] <%dds333a> @srgoatz time to say goodbye
[1:36:08] <andre11dr> I don't wanna jinx it but ,we all remember what happened to Reggie in the Dokapon kingdom endgame, it looks like history could repeat itself
[1:36:23] <maznuts> kicks is a cursed name
[1:36:29] <glass_marcus> Like Poetry, it rhymes
[1:36:33] <Solidnick18> maybe reggie can bet it all on red chests SeriousSloth
[1:36:36] <maznuts> lets go back to Bobby Kodic
[1:36:36] <+Jiggisnipe> he could have then he would die in battle cuz he has no hp, also field magic isn't great since it takes your whole turn. Mage just isn't as good as Amazon or Knight

[1:37:50] <glass_marcus> i assumed all knowledge of this game exist in unorganized forums
[1:37:53] <Bromosap1ens> Y'know the motivated meme is a bit much imo. It's not even really rooted in DMC canon. Isn't it just from MVC?

[1:40:14] <Mundkipz> like i feel woolie is trying to point reggie at minh cause woolie isn't scared of reggie
[1:40:18] <Equirah> woolie is talking to himself, not reggie
[1:40:19] <+Flunkorg> woolie is the demon speaking false hope into reggies ears
[1:40:20] <%topendbuzza> so thats how kicks got his name
[1:40:27] <%paladinstarbuster> reggie made his bed
[1:40:35] <morningmoondude> woolie is graspin at straws

[1:41:07] <+Flunkorg> I just want to see reggies hands just slowly go towards minh's cam
[1:41:09] <%dds333a> they were already "allied" in the 2v1, and it didn't work LUL
[1:41:10] <maznuts> Woolie the lier yet again
[1:41:17] <%Fetrigon> @mundkipz bruh minh has 10x the wealth of everyone else. It's time to collude.
[1:41:17] <%AceNugget> Woolie is trying to stop Reggie from going full hollow
[1:41:18] <%topendbuzza> correct
[1:41:18] <%NahmenJayden> I'm rooting for reggie till the end. Get that 11th hour win!
[1:41:23] <%topendbuzza> he will get in
[1:41:28] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Woolie the Pie Thief Liar emerges!
[1:41:35] <%JetpackMcQuack> you never know

[1:43:08] <%topendbuzza> reggie 9 mill bounty
[1:43:09] <Estwilde> Took a lot of it from Reggie

[1:43:12] <andre11dr> @th3smartalec Reggie had  a bounty
[1:43:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice
[1:43:15] <+Srgoatz> hopefully Reggie gets fat paychecks out of this
[1:43:18] <%dds333a> It took woolie going kaioken to beat him, and even then he got lucky like Joseph because Minh was distracted LUL
[1:43:29] <alroy909> @Th3SmartAlec minh killd reggie after he tried to rob a shop
[1:43:32] <Carlioo> I see everyone is having a lot of fun
[1:43:37] <+Jiggisnipe> Remember Woolie only killed Minh cuz Minh forgot he could give up
[1:43:40] <%dds333a> @srgoatz the only alternative is winning the lottery, that I can see
[1:44:01] <andre11dr> Let's be honest, Minh beat himself when he decided to not take the Sangreal from Woolie

[1:53:54] <%paladinstarbuster> what was reggie even robbing that shop for?

[1:54:04] <+Jiggisnipe> shield or armor I thinl
[1:54:08] <+Jiggisnipe> think*
[1:54:09] <glass_marcus> @paladinstarbuster I think a shield
[1:54:17] <+Jiggisnipe> there were a bounty claimed earlier in the game
[1:54:20] <+Jiggisnipe> was*
[1:54:20] <Estwilde> Minh inventing history to try and make the game fel closer :)
[1:54:24] <+Srgoatz> his voice BibleThump
[1:54:24] <alroy909> reggie should help woolie surpass minh, by getting a bounty twice and offering himself to woolie twice, now that would be a bold move

[2:09:19] <%paladinstarbuster> @dds333a wow
[2:09:20] <+Srgoatz> @andre11dr  might??????
[2:09:27] <Hammatime8> @paladinstarbuster Magic defence, since furious attack is technically an attack magic
[2:09:28] <morningmoondude> with darkness and actually getting in the tower, the ONLY move that *delays*, not even defeat, just delays Minh would be Sunshine
[2:09:32] <andre11dr> I mean like he might die next turn
[2:09:48] <just_matt_ds> @Th3SmartAlec If they get to his same floor, they can do that
[2:09:50] <@Menitta> it just occurred to me I don't really know how these games end
[2:10:00] <+Srgoatz> yeah HE might actually just DIE on his seat
[2:10:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> @just_matt_ds but Fling throws him OUT of the dungeon?
[2:10:16] <%dds333a> @hammatime8 as in the stat? or the option, because you can't defend against it

[2:11:46] <Hammatime8> Minh can't lose unless he has an IRL heart attack, and given how this session has gone, Reggie would be the one to have a heart attack Kappa

[2:12:08] <%Tearonex> @GHouseduivel too dark outside for me to be fully sure LUL
[2:12:08] <just_matt_ds> I can't wait for them to see the final boss
[2:12:16] <GHouseduivel> LUL
[2:12:19] <%paladinstarbuster> @oda_flobunaga nah it wasnt reggie just refused to hamper him with his bags of field magic

[2:12:47] <%NahmenJayden> the last boss is Minh
[2:12:51] <+Jiggisnipe> @paladinstarbuster tbf Reggie would have not progress to do that. It's field magic or move
[2:12:56] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> What an adventure this has been
[2:13:00] <andre11dr> I can't wait for them to overthink the final boss when they can all one shot it at this point
[2:13:04] <just_matt_ds> It's over
[2:13:04] <Solidnick18> Damn
[2:13:05] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> A journey one might even say
[2:13:06] <morningmoondude> SIGMA MINHSET
[2:13:06] <%TheBensonator_> welp
[2:13:08] <%NahmenJayden> oh god
[2:13:12] <Hammatime8> Minh really doesn't need to pleay the game in PVE
[2:13:13] <%TheBensonator_> woolieMINHMAX
[2:13:22] <TreeLeafBoi> THAT'S MY GOAT
[2:13:22] <%dds333a> @paladinstarbuster correct, but it should be mentioned that Paladins passively mitigate field magic
[2:13:24] <%AceNugget> Get a homie stock
[2:13:27] <%Fetrigon> WHY ARE YOU GIVING THIS MAN A 1-UP
[2:13:29] <@Menitta> "You're not human....are you?"
[2:13:29] <Solidnick18> j was hoping he wouldn't get that
[2:13:31] <%dds333a> Just like last time
[2:13:51] <%paladinstarbuster> @Jiggisnipe moving idnt really help him trying to do the mission boned him
[2:13:55] <Hammatime8> It's actually just over
[2:14:06] <+Srgoatz> "grandpa minh what are those strange disks on your wall?" "those sre victories, child"
[2:14:10] <%dds333a> this is why it was so hard for him to get down the first time LUL
[2:14:10] <+Jiggisnipe> @paladinstarbuster exactly, you should never do the main quest until you're level 99 lol
[2:14:29] <Hammatime8> We're all just watching Minh finish up his solo playthrough at this point
[2:14:36] <brunoberserk> week of DARKNESS
[2:14:36] <%paladinstarbuster> @dds333a only damage right it wouldnt help against comas or startles or any debuff.
[2:14:44] <%Shad0wTag> @Srgoatz change grandpa to great great grandpa, minh will outlive them all
[2:15:02] <+RurouniGeo> tppowerLokar 1000 YEARS OF DARKNESS tppowerFree
[2:15:03] <just_matt_ds> @Srgoatz he'll just keep blessing
[2:15:17] <andre11dr> Oh shit  what if the dark doesn't go away until the monster dies ? LUL
[2:15:18] <%topendbuzza> the dokaorb will be it yes?
[2:15:23] <%dds333a> @paladinstarbuster yes, so those options do stand. I remember sessions ago people talking about putting him to sleep 9n the map, and ganking him
[2:15:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> get indoors
[2:15:33] <oda_flobunaga> can we get a bet going for the final standings?
[2:15:36] <glass_marcus> Dokapon is just deciding it's ending today

[2:18:14] <andre11dr> Does Reggie even have field magic right now ?
[2:18:20] <+Jiggisnipe> he does
[2:18:28] <just_matt_ds> Gather is the play rn
[2:18:28] <%dds333a> can't get him from in Rabble LUL
[2:18:31] <alroy909> gather doesn't work for someone inside a dungeon
[2:18:36] <Hammatime8> @just_matt_ds It doesn't work on Minh right now, so there's no point
[2:18:42] <%Fetrigon> @just_matt_ds woolieMINHMAX game's good on my end
[2:18:52] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:18:56] <just_matt_ds> It does if he gets in the tower
[2:18:58] <%dds333a> @fetrigon works on my machine
[2:18:59] <just_matt_ds> And pulls him down
[2:19:07] <just_matt_ds> He needs to crab
[2:19:10] <Courtjestercurt> Does gather work if multiple people are in the dungeon?
[2:19:10] <just_matt_ds> Crab to survive
[2:19:13] <NoviceArtist4090> Gangster’s Paradise but it’s vocoded to Gangster’s Paradise
[2:19:20] <+Jiggisnipe> @just_matt_ds the tower is different screens so it probably won't work

[2:20:22] <GHouseduivel> Where's wallace man?
[2:20:24] <%emperordread> Just got here chat, What did they do to my boy Reggie??!
[2:20:29] <+Srgoatz> green chest = lockpick ???
[2:20:32] <%dds333a> so his appearance in Kingdom is an easter egg, where he's MASSIVELY stronger
[2:20:35] <oda_flobunaga> 12 on a 5 spin LOL
[2:20:40] <%dds333a> he was a king quest
[2:20:45] <%paladinstarbuster> @emperordread The real question iss what did reggie do to himself
[2:20:45] <%Fetrigon> @emperordread Reggie did it to himself LUL
[2:20:46] <%dds333a> an optional challenge
[2:20:48] <+hoenhime344> god damnit... 2 hours late again

[2:21:34] <%dds333a> it was my theory that this is it
[2:21:39] <brunoberserk> Wallace ,  Hand of the Emperor
[2:21:55] <%dds333a> since kingdom has it that rabble is the penultimate dungeon
[2:22:04] <morningmoondude> god i can't believe i have to step away exactly when it could all end

[2:38:37] <BurdRightsActivist> PROBLEM SOLVED KEKW
[2:38:40] <%paladinstarbuster> If reggie was a witch it may have went different
[2:38:41] <+pingu_crimson> Or the new game on the switch, if yall feel like playing on Japanese
[2:38:43] <Hammatime8> Mage saved Reggie a  few times, but Paladin just gave Minh invincibility once he figured it out
[2:38:44] <+Jiggisnipe> in Kingdom, Mage would be fine
[2:38:51] <%AceNugget> not being able to field magic and move made magic awful
[2:38:56] <+Jiggisnipe> ^
[2:38:57] <+Srgoatz> he learned. adapted. destroyed competition. and won.
[2:39:00] <Qu1ckyyy> Mage is stupid because Banish exists, why even try magic when there is an instakill
[2:39:07] <%dds333a> it's also auto for reggie
[2:39:13] <+Jiggisnipe> why try magic when they have shock LUL
[2:39:21] <%Fetrigon> @qu1ckyyy magic can miss
[2:39:28] <%dds333a> @qu1ckyyy it's obvious, but yeah
[2:39:35] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Only health
[2:39:38] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Tank to the end
[2:39:43] <brunoberserk> also : darkling SUCKS in this game
[2:39:45] <%dds333a> @fetrigon most magic can't
[2:39:46] <+Jiggisnipe> @fetrigon battle magic can't I don't think, you have to defend it
[2:39:51] <andre11dr> But ,i also feel like Reggie played his class really bad ,he should've been nuking people with field magic left and right but he used it like 4 times
[2:39:54] <+hoenhime344> but each choice lead to your defeat
[2:40:12] <just_matt_ds> @brunoberserk Minh made himself functionally stronger than Darkling by leveling
[2:40:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> sometimes game just says no
[2:40:14] <%dds333a> banish is extremely easy to telegraph, but it works damn well, obviously
[2:40:20] <glass_marcus> Field magic takes a turn and will probably hit no one
[2:40:21] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie had to kill with field magic, then grind when they are dead, and repeat
[2:40:23] <%Fetrigon> @jiggisnipe @dds333a ah ok. sorry
[2:40:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[2:40:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> well. that was fast LMAO. Guessing the final boss gave Minh the win?
[2:40:38] <%bevyrage> wait is this a short session?
[2:40:43] <nintega010> @andre11dr woolie dodges and minh class halves the dmg
[2:40:44] <Darmanimon> wait did Minh win Dokapon again? Hell yeah brother 2 in a row
[2:40:53] <just_matt_ds> @bevyrage Yeah, the LP is over
[2:40:54] <%Fetrigon> @th3smartalec on a silver platter
[2:40:58] <%bevyrage> dammit
[2:41:03] <Solidnick18> The LP is done
[2:41:05] <%dds333a> @fetrigon no issue
[2:41:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> @fetrigon of course LUL
[2:41:10] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:41:20] <just_matt_ds> Wallace jobbed harder than Shockmaster
[2:41:23] <Reveresao> Minh again wut PogChamp
[2:41:27] <Picosunloaded> This game is a lot worse than the other one
[2:41:27] <%BisoromiBear> Luck is a skill
[2:41:37] <andre11dr> @th3smartalec He literally one shot the boss
[2:41:37] <+Jiggisnipe> he could have gave up
[2:41:48] <+Srgoatz> luck >>>>>>> brains
[2:41:53] <%TreeLeafBoi> or when he forgot he swapped health
[2:41:55] <andre11dr> The final boss didn't even get to do a single move
[2:41:59] <%dds333a> @jiggisnipe yeah, and he was distracted, and so he didn't
[2:42:00] <%baka_sugoi> PowerUpL woolieMINHMAX PowerUpR
[2:42:00] <just_matt_ds> @Picosunloaded Oh absolutely, most of this shit feels like it wasn't even playtesterd
[2:42:09] <%Fetrigon> Excited for Dokapon Up! in 2022 or 2023
[2:42:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @andre11dr ah. luck is in fact a skill then
[2:42:16] <+Jiggisnipe> @TreeLeafBoi that sucked, Biggest brain move into smallest brain move LUL
[2:42:17] <+MisterArcanine> The luck was so incredible at the end it was almost frustrating lol
[2:42:28] <+pingu_crimson> so Dokapon Up! or a Kingdom rollback?
[2:42:34] <OldManDeckardCain> the bounty didn't even matter in the end, minh would have won by almost 2 millions iirc
[2:42:39] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie couldn't kill Minh
[2:42:39] <%dds333a> @just_matt_ds I'd say it was, just designed to be fucked up LUL
[2:42:40] <Solidnick18> Dokapon UP will be interesting.
[2:42:45] <+Srgoatz> thing is his build was good, woolie
[2:42:47] <legacy0117> Wallace sounded like he was about to power up, then he just flipped. So underwhelming.
[2:42:50] <+Srgoatz> fail proof
[2:42:53] <andre11dr> Man ,Banish payd off HARD
[2:42:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> how much money was being given for the post game rewards btw?
[2:42:56] <legacy0117> Flopped*
[2:42:58] <%paladinstarbuster> towns were aactually worth it
[2:43:01] <%holydeviant1> @pingu_crimson I'd prefer fortune street, but why not finish out the series?
[2:43:06] <nintega010> dokapon up now, but we'll have to wait for them to recharge
[2:43:11] <just_matt_ds> @dds333a Paladin HP was not tested, you can't tell me it was tested
[2:43:13] <%AceNugget> Would love to convince them into more Doka but you see the look in Reggie's eyes right?
[2:43:22] <+Jiggisnipe> @Th3SmartAlec each thing was an extra 1 mill except for most player kills which was 2 mill
[2:43:27] <%Fetrigon> @th3smartalec I think 5 million in total
[2:43:32] <%Shad0wTag> @AceNugget this shit is once every 2 years
[2:43:33] <Realimpact> good hustle
[2:43:33] <glass_marcus> @Th3SmartAlec a million per reward, aside from minh who got 2 million for being the biggest murderer
[2:43:35] <galilafigala> 1Mil for towns, monsters and serving Penny's whims, 2mil for the most Player kills
[2:43:37] <%dds333a> @legacy0117 his being overleveled didn't even matter LUL
[2:43:38] <%holydeviant1> Just channel that anger into Dark Souls, Reggie
[2:43:40] <brunoberserk> yeeeeeeeeeeUP
[2:43:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @jiggisnipe ah so same as my game. must be fixed then.
[2:43:41] <%livlinn> forgottenFun
[2:43:41] <+MisterArcanine> I will say I think this game is more poorly balanced over Kingdom, but Kingdom also had more weird racism soooo
[2:43:45] <+Srgoatz> sould
[2:43:46] <wawila> @WoolieVersus Which Dokapon did you enjoy more?
[2:43:46] <%Fetrigon> yes
[2:43:49] <%dds333a> sure was
[2:43:49] <just_matt_ds> Oh yeah, *player kills* being more valuable than any objective are fucked up
[2:43:51] <Solidnick18> i liked kingdom more than this
[2:43:53] <Estwilde> Party games = Just say no
[2:44:03] <%paladinstarbuster> Kingdom was clearly the better game
[2:44:04] <just_matt_ds> @Solidnick18 it's a much better game
[2:44:05] <brunoberserk> reggie , king of the hollows LUL
[2:44:09] <andre11dr> Also another big thing, Minhs class skill was SO BROKEN compared to what everyone else had
[2:44:22] <%Fetrigon> You two took a FAT L. I know you want to redeem yourselves. LUL LUL LUL
[2:44:23] <+pingu_crimson> Kingdom was definitely the better game
[2:44:24] <andre11dr> Blessing is fucking stupid as hell
[2:44:25] <just_matt_ds> Like i said, it wasn't playtested
[2:44:26] <%livlinn> Another Kingdom round would be nice shiaYum
[2:44:31] <legacy0117> It’s true,  but a second form could have been loaded with immunity to insta death.
[2:44:31] <+Jiggisnipe> Remember Journey is a remake of the 1st or at least early Dokapon game. Kingdom technically comes after
[2:44:34] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:44:35] <FlowLethal> reggie would have been better with witch and or even spy
[2:44:35] <OblivionSword1> to be fair Journey is mostly a remake of an old SNES dokapon game
[2:44:51] <Estwilde> The game was over even before Minh killed Reggie
[2:44:52] <FlowLethal> reggie just didnt have good class this game
[2:44:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> funny how the one with best luck ended up with the worst
[2:44:53] <Estwilde> tbh
[2:44:54] <%paladinstarbuster> yes that
[2:44:55] <%TreeLeafBoi> morale of the story keep all of your money on hand
[2:45:02] <+Jiggisnipe> Darkling is fine early game
[2:45:13] <+Srgoatz> emulate the original one for the snes next run lmao
[2:45:15] <brunoberserk> darkling is really bad in this game , not worth
[2:45:17] <nintega010> I tossed darkling out of my head
[2:45:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Darkling was "try to kill him, there is nothing else you can do."
[2:45:24] <%Fetrigon> oof woolieKICKDAD
[2:45:25] <Realimpact> look at woolie's face hahahaha
[2:45:25] <%dds333a> These games are great LUL
[2:45:27] <+RurouniGeo> Someone translate Dokapon UP! Mugen no Roulette so they can play that next year on Switch tpanimeYGOcreepy
[2:45:28] <%MrATheGreat> Because it was going to end anyway. There was no second step imo
[2:45:30] <legacy0117> Gather.
[2:45:32] <Hammatime8> There was no catching up with Minh as Darkling
[2:45:34] <legacy0117> Easy.
[2:45:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> and there wasnt anything you could in the end anyway LUL
[2:45:39] <glass_marcus> even if reggie gave him the bounty, minh would have won
[2:45:42] <andre11dr> Darkling is only good early game in this
[2:45:49] <oda_flobunaga> Reggie should have robbed another store and presented his anus to Woolie
[2:45:51] <just_matt_ds> Darkling is pointless in this game, Minh was *playing as one* withou even needing the transformation
[2:45:52] <Estwilde> Minh's just trying to downplay things and act like it was a lot closer than it actually was
[2:45:57] <zechariah1799> @rurounigeo I think there is already a fan translation
[2:46:00] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL yea
[2:46:04] <%MrATheGreat> @RurouniGeo It's already translated... unofficially
[2:46:04] <%TreeLeafBoi> @RurouniGeo I believe there is a fan translation out and working
[2:46:05] <andre11dr> Kingdom made Darkling so much better with the points wheel
[2:46:08] <+Jiggisnipe> he could have done 2 bounties for Woolie to win
[2:46:09] <+Srgoatz> minh with that 5d chess
[2:46:15] <%dds333a> Did it? LUL
[2:46:15] <brunoberserk> COLLUSION ?
[2:46:43] <zechariah1799> I would love an official translation though because I love Utawarerumono
[2:46:52] <%ekodrop> @RurouniGeo there's a patch
[2:46:54] <@Menitta> the developers should write a book about war
[2:47:07] <andre11dr> How much did the final boss even give him ?
[2:47:07] <%paladinstarbuster> 1 bounty was more than muktipe chapter rewards
[2:47:08] <Hammatime8> Even if every bonus end reward was multiplied by 10, Minh still would have won
[2:47:12] <%Fetrigon> bro it was a 10x lead at end game. C O L L U D E
[2:47:21] <+Jiggisnipe> well awards
[2:47:39] <%dds333a> there might have been more, but yeah
[2:47:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:47:40] <+Jiggisnipe> most towns, most big monsters, most player kills, doing most quests
[2:47:43] <+MisterArcanine> The final rewards being so low was also what the fuck
[2:47:46] <%Fetrigon> @andre11dr most def
[2:47:47] <%dds333a> not many, I  can think of
[2:47:58] <+Jiggisnipe> by far
[2:47:59] <just_matt_ds> Playing the objective was counterproducing lmao
[2:48:02] <%TreeLeafBoi> yeah
[2:48:04] <FlowLethal> journey takes more brain
[2:48:08] <%dds333a> I like em both, but yeah
[2:48:13] <%paladinstarbuster> well kingdom is the sequel
[2:48:13] <oda_flobunaga> Kingdom Redun incoming?
[2:48:15] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:48:15] <%MajorCrasher> I just got here is it over??

[2:48:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @misterarcanine I can't believe those don't scale
[2:48:26] <%baka_sugoi> A G E
[2:48:26] <just_matt_ds> @FlowLethal Not really, it mostly just takes grinding
[2:48:27] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:48:30] <just_matt_ds> As we have seen here
[2:48:32] <%dds333a> they wanted it that way LUL
[2:48:32] <+pingu_crimson> actually could we get the older dokapon games?
[2:48:33] <%Fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:48:44] <andre11dr> When Minh smashed both of them in that 2v1 ,i realized that Minhs build is to broken to beat
[2:48:45] <shadowdragon1s> LUL
[2:48:47] <+Jiggisnipe> I wonder how the other classes are in Journey
[2:48:52] <FlowLethal> i wish kingdom had more classes
[2:48:57] <zechariah1799> Journey is Kingdoms grumpy grandparent
[2:49:01] <%dds333a> and more plays
[2:49:02] <big_oki> can we play kingdom again?
[2:49:09] <FlowLethal> ninja or alchemist is meta
[2:49:14] <FlowLethal> escape is just go to skill
[2:49:23] <%dds333a> makes darkling actually worth it
[2:49:25] <%Fetrigon> Absolutely
[2:49:26] <Solidnick18> Darkling fucking sucked
[2:49:29] <+Jiggisnipe> @andre11dr exactly, then Woolie explained how Minh's build covers everything with HP, Blessing, Shock and Banish LUL
[2:49:30] <big_oki> KINGDOM GREATEST HITS
[2:49:35] <%dds333a> and nerfed bosses in turn
[2:49:36] <@Menitta> journey came out after Kingdom right?
[2:49:50] <+Jiggisnipe> @Menitta yes but it's a remake of the 1st one

[2:49:51] <just_matt_ds> @Menitta It's a SNES game though
[2:49:51] <%Qsmash_> journey is a remake of an SNES game
[2:49:52] <%dds333a> @menitta it did, but journey is a remake of the first game
[2:49:57] <@Menitta> oooh
[2:49:57] <%dds333a> of the second one
[2:50:00] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:50:05] <%Fetrigon> LUL
[2:50:05] <andre11dr> Also the ending in this game is so underwhelming
[2:50:22] <nintega010> I would like to see Dokapon up even fan translated. But that'll be a year from now unless they get bored and just play again
[2:50:28] <%dds333a> that's the point, yeah
[2:50:29] <andre11dr> The final boss in Kingdom was epic as hell compared to what happened today
[2:50:36] <+Jiggisnipe> Heck in Kingdom was hard too
[2:50:39] <Wahrow> I wish the Switch one was localized just to see you play, haha
[2:50:47] <solardx101> THIS FINAL BOSS WAS ASS
[2:50:49] <%paladinstarbuster> Yeah wallace was a chump
[2:50:50] <FlowLethal> kingdom has auto counters on bosses and banish doesnt work on some things
[2:50:57] <FlowLethal> like bosses
[2:51:00] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:51:02] <+Jiggisnipe> yes Banish is broken LUL
[2:51:13] <%TreeLeafBoi> Kingdom does not have Lisa Plenty 0/10
[2:51:28] <andre11dr> Blessing and  Banish was game ruining
[2:51:29] <%dds333a> @treeleafboi *Liza Kappa
[2:51:41] <%dds333a> still this game had SECRET SHOPS
[2:51:47] <%TreeLeafBoi> @dds333a I'm a fake fan :(
[2:51:49] <%jinking79> only got to used Puppet once
[2:51:49] <%dds333a> that's neat
[2:51:53] <+Srgoatz> brutal
[2:51:55] <+pingu_crimson> There is a fan translation for Up!, but there's some jank to it
[2:52:07] <%dds333a> @treeleafboi LUL
[2:52:16] <%dds333a> it's not just numbers for weapons too
[2:52:37] <FlowLethal> class grinding takes time in kingdom  like fastest way is to kill opponent
[2:52:40] <+pingu_crimson> The King's requests were good too
[2:52:43] <andre11dr> Also Kingdom felt way longer
[2:52:43] <%dds333a> casino cave
[2:52:49] <FlowLethal> some classes need like 7 8 9 battles for 1 class level
[2:52:56] <Equirah> @pingu_crimson there'll be jank to it either way LUL
[2:53:02] <just_matt_ds> Oh my god i just remembered Minh stealing the fucking underwater treasure from reggie with a mystery lmao
[2:53:02] <Hammatime8> Was the volcano even ever used in the story?
[2:53:12] <+pingu_crimson> @pingu_crimson i mean fair LUL
[2:53:22] <%dds333a> @hammatime8 nope, solely for a king quest
[2:53:38] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:53:42] <Wahrow> @pingu_crimson They should play it next week!
[2:54:01] <%paladinstarbuster> mysteries lost reggie the game no cap
[2:54:08] <andre11dr> Yeah they never got puppet again, but that shit is the most broken shit ,just sell everything and rob
[2:54:26] <+Srgoatz> reggie has such an innonence behind his eyes. this session broke my heart
[2:54:28] <Equirah> mystery gather doesn't pull from buildings, only big monster
[2:54:35] <Solidnick18> yeah
[2:54:37] <%dds333a> @andre11dr sell and rebuy loops LUL

[2:54:52] <%dds333a> I feel like they did LUL
[2:54:56] <%Fetrigon> @wahrow gonna need recovery man. This shit takes a lot out of ya.
[2:54:57] <+pingu_crimson> @Hammatime8 for one of the chapters, you can only advance if you buy 5 of one item found at that shop at that point in the game
[2:55:00] <%dds333a> but they didn't care
[2:55:18] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus tell Reggie not to be so down, this was , after all, predetermined
[2:55:31] <%dds333a> @pingu_crimson although the location is random every time, but yeah

[3:23:33] <+Jiggisnipe> that sounds good
[3:23:37] <FlowLethal> thats busted
[3:23:38] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 Im just missing this stream
[3:23:42] <maznuts> thats pog
[3:23:55] <andre11dr> That's amazing
[3:23:55] <OblivionSword1> the wiki has more info
[3:23:57] <Hammatime8> Okay, so the different genders are actually completely different classes?
[3:24:00] <%paladinstarbuster> @WoolieVersus Can Increase his Attack and Defense Stats in Battle
[3:24:10] <%dds333a> @hammatime8 yep they even look different
[3:24:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's pretty good
[3:24:59] <%dds333a> remember soul fire, that was nuts LUL
[3:25:00] <Hammatime8> @dds333a I thought looking different was the only difference. Like, I thought amazon was just a different looking fighter
[3:25:18] <+Jiggisnipe> see Woolie got speed from his class so Reggie was kinda fucked with field magic
[3:25:21] <galilafigala> Different genders are different classes essentially yes
[3:25:32] <%dds333a> flat heal
[3:25:37] <+pingu_crimson> @WoolieVersus Glare can basically paralyze someone
[3:25:41] <%townzzzzz> BANDIT
[3:25:55] <%dds333a> not too good overall
[3:25:57] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie did once Kappa
[3:26:06] <%dds333a> anything Kappa
[3:26:07] <Hammatime8> That is SO much lamer than the map steal from kingdom
[3:26:09] <+Jiggisnipe> steal your AT Ring
[3:26:21] <%paladinstarbuster> anything
[3:26:50] <%dds333a> quest items too, obviously
[3:27:02] <%dds333a> catching field magic is great
[3:27:03] <+Jiggisnipe> Vacuum is awful
[3:27:21] <+Jiggisnipe> it's useful against other mages or certain enemies
[3:27:25] <%dds333a> vacuum is useless against physical monsyer
[3:27:57] <%dds333a> double is good
[3:28:04] <%dds333a> if you plan
[3:28:08] <+Jiggisnipe> double is kinda cool
[3:28:11] <%paladinstarbuster> WAY better
[3:28:20] <+Jiggisnipe> you're just wasting their time
[3:28:57] <+Jiggisnipe> Witch might be better than Mage but not by alot
[3:28:58] <%dds333a> that's why soul fire was busted
[3:29:09] <%paladinstarbuster> this is what comas and startles
[3:29:39] <Hammatime8> Did they read what the spy does?
[3:29:50] <%dds333a> they're getting there, I think
[3:30:01] <%dds333a> but they read bandit so I dunno

[3:31:22] <+Jiggisnipe> well
[3:31:24] <just_matt_ds> You're missing two classes
[3:31:28] <Hammatime8> I think they skipped reading what the spy does

[3:31:34] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh's class becomes broken with banish and shock
[3:31:39] <andre11dr> Woolie is missing Soy
