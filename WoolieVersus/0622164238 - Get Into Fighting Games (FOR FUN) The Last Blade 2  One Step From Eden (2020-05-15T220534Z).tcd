[0:04:56] <%That_Mojo> the last bladde 2? what the 2nd to last bladde
[0:05:02] <%perfectsalami> I was just checking if the messages would get through if i donated during the sub reading. and they didnt.
[0:05:03] <Leonavius> oh it wasn't just me earlier then
[0:05:11] <arkv01> two balls, one soul
[0:05:31] <@Solidus_113> more streams give more opportunities for people to donate, but YT gives the paycheck
[0:05:32] <Jetsfantasy> But also youtube is hot garbage for daily live stuff
[0:05:34] <%RioGascar> tho they were when I changed my username to ‚Äúsaul goodman or jimmy mcgill‚Äù for my dumb donation gimmicks
[0:05:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> cheer500 Blood for the bloodpool! Also been playing One Step from Eden almost nonstop, that game is LEGIT.
[0:05:40] <arkv01> also streams are HYPE
[0:05:43] <%Grayhammatter> YT gives the dosh
[0:05:49] <%Solidnick18> youtube is the bread and butter.
[0:05:53] <DedlokPM> Plus the Twitch stuff is him doing the recording stuff for youtube/the podcast but on the internet instead of offline
[0:05:56] <DoctorArby> Twitch is sidehustle... YT is the main bread
[0:05:57] <%thespacerunaway> @Solidus_113 Never said a truer word

[0:09:39] <%Nekros4442> You have to just win the game lol
[0:09:50] <%Nekros4442> It's a pve game first
[0:09:52] <artificiallynatural> gotta get to at least stage 4 to start unlocking the characters
[0:09:52] <Triplicat> might need to cop a save from someone to do that
[0:09:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @WoolieVersus It's a process dude, you gotta unlock. PVE first...
[0:10:06] <Zayasu> is there a good deal for the game somewhere?
[0:10:09] <Triplicat> I didn't even know chars were locked in PVP in the first place
[0:10:43] <TigerClaws12> unless someone can export a save
[0:10:45] <+arancet> it took me 4-5 hours of total steam time to get full unlocks, not bad, but still, your time is valuable

[1:10:45] <benbenboston> last blade 2 is free?
[1:10:46] <huskarl_zap> uh some codes can be malicious
[1:10:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> It's his great grandfather @woolieversus
[1:10:50] <+zepelinnn1> yeah, if you drop codes consider making a character ? and typing it later
[1:10:50] <+Wizardism> damn too many attempts rip zoe2ndrunner

[1:13:04] <NiktenKing> Is that a morphing owl?
[1:13:09] <huskarl_zap> nani
[1:13:17] <rsg220> this is a rushdown of codes
[1:13:32] <+leomc2> jesus yall are genorous
[1:13:40] <LilRamza> wow that mk code is super rare
[1:13:48] <townzzzzz> 4 ways of inputting it btw
[1:13:49] <jubejube56> Just reminds me of Legends of Ga'Hool
[1:13:59] <%ChoculaUltra> holy damage
[1:13:59] <%Nekros4442> Jesus christ.....Woolie I spent 10 minutes in training mode and found a really stupid loop/infinite with Akari
[1:14:00] <drefizz> My social security number 1
[1:14:03] <%Malik1002> @woolieversus Got to power up with double half circle strong/ then use forward half circle strong and light attack together
[1:14:04] <%optimasmaximas> @wardenofwinter for what?
[1:14:09] <+wardenofwinter> Steam
[1:14:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> ok so, my recommendation is anyone got any codes wait a bit, caus a lot of people are locked out
[1:14:16] <Manwad> God these sprites are gorgous
[1:14:30] <KAISERWAVE> standard is ABC, ABC, AB then 236 C
[1:14:57] <+gaomachine> Zanetsu reminds me of Wins Without a Knife from Master of the Flying Guillotine.. who shamelessly exploits the Martial Arts Moniker by packing knives to stab folks with when they least expect it.
[1:14:58] <drefizz> does this game have date-able waifus?
[1:14:59] <NiktenKing> ENIG WHAT? cmonBruh
[1:15:16] <+TheOneCalledRock> i think the lockout timer is 30 mins?
[1:15:17] <jubejube56> @drefizz define "date-able"
[1:15:31] <arkv01> will they cut your dick off? 80/20
[1:15:41] <jubejube56> They likely could if they wanted to
[1:15:42] <drefizz> legal age and can be asked out in the game @jubejube56
[1:15:44] <majinken> If you have flash on it can be a better indication to press the next button
[1:15:58] <%JBoogieG> Last one from me tonight
[1:16:04] <%Grayhammatter> wow, nice
[1:16:19] <TacoBomber> looks like he was headpatting
[1:16:26] <KAISERWAVE> some launch
[1:16:42] <%Urdunngurdunn> @drefizz modern day legal age or?
[1:16:42] <drefizz> that flashing light meters are hard to look at
[1:16:45] <KAISERWAVE> Setsuna is suuuuch a good starting character

[1:16:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> does anyone know if this is on the switch?

[1:17:18] <majinken> @GalacticaPhanto nope
[1:17:28] <%SomersaultJustice> I think there might be an ACA release on the switch of the first game
[1:17:29] <NiktenKing> It's on the collection I think

[1:19:09] <%Jetzord> @jubejube56 Not everyone is as fly as a G6
[1:19:10] <%SomersaultJustice> no undertaker get ups for you
[1:19:28] <KAISERWAVE> Doesn't Mukuro have an unblockable?
[1:19:35] <NiktenKing> Mukuro reminds me of Kazeshini from Bleach
[1:19:39] <%ChoculaUltra> I still say Moriya was totally 100% designed after Seijuro Hiko from RRK
[1:19:51] <%ChoculaUltra> or just Kenshin vibes in general
[1:19:55] <%Grayhammatter> aw no
[1:19:59] <%SirGO0SE> it does remind me of Kenshin but with less pedophilia
[1:20:00] <+leomc2> its always cool hearing/finding out what parts of the Get into fighting games intros is from which game.
[1:20:00] <arkv01> un UNG UNG UNGA
[1:20:01] <artificiallynatural> the timing is so strict on that
[1:20:06] <%SomersaultJustice> @KAISERWAVE is there something wrong with iroha's opening and ending story cutscenes on samsho switch? when I start them it just shows a black screen
[1:20:07] <huskarl_zap> I cant buy the game because I've been attempting steam codes
[1:20:11] <dweebenheimer20> The kenshin creator got a lot of designs from samsho, so that wouldnt surprise me
[1:20:18] <majinken> @WoolieVersus What about Koryu?

[2:31:47] <+ElectricFoxLex> Ukemi is not safe
[2:31:49] <majinken> @WoolieVersus D as you touch the ground
[2:31:58] <%theman515> !discord

[2:32:29] <Mr_McFries> do it do it do it
[2:32:40] <Mr_McFries> ah
[2:32:44] <+ElectricFoxLex> Reggie, if you do his teleport and press A+C during teleport you get 0 frames of recovery during teleport
[2:32:46] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> what a pose

[2:32:48] <DedlokPM> poor yuki doodSad
[2:32:51] <+jetjagger222> that ryu pose
[2:32:53] <@Menitta> GG @WoolieVersus
[2:33:03] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> what a magical game
[2:33:07] <Mr_McFries> JACKU
[2:33:09] <+ElectricFoxLex> You can do deflect super but you have very little time to do so
[2:33:09] <Illithid72> Are they planning on checking out the Ghosts gameplay after this?
[2:33:10] <majinken> @WoolieVersus You can deflect super
[2:33:12] <@Menitta> Damn, that fuckin deflect
[2:33:18] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> oh hey you guys nee dto try the secret character
[2:33:26] <+ElectricFoxLex> Also you can deflect supers
[2:33:28] <%ChoculaUltra> Show me a good time, Jack!
[2:33:34] <%Jack8274> i suck btw
[2:33:35] <Mr_McFries> ah the little heart
[2:33:39] <%SirGO0SE> Jack, the fastest fingers in the west
[2:33:39] <%ChoculaUltra> That's the spirit!
[2:33:44] <+jetjagger222> you can be crueler than that
[2:33:45] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> no theres a non boss exclusive
[2:33:51] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> you gotta do it
[2:33:53] <+ElectricFoxLex> And you can deflect specials too
[2:33:57] <bleugh> are the last blades connected to samsho in any way? both made by snk right?
[2:33:59] <%stote45> you might have to hold forward as you hid d if I'm not mistaken
[2:34:01] <+jetjagger222> oh no he knows
[2:34:02] <%gatorafan> Ye Kagami was the last boss of the first game
[2:34:05] <Mr_McFries> well now I wanna see the bow and arrow
[2:34:07] <+StriderTempxa> God the animation in this game is fucking fantastic.
[2:34:14] <artificiallynatural> samsho and last blade take place in completely different eras
[2:34:19] <+ElectricFoxLex> So if you see a special with a gap in it, press Deflect
[2:34:21] <DedlokPM> @bleugh both made by snk but think that is the extent of the connection
[2:34:30] <%ChoculaUltra> I would definitely follow Amano around calling him bossu had I lived in that era.
[2:34:48] <%Grayhammatter> the spacing
[2:34:55] <Mr_McFries> @ChoculaUltra and he'd be the guy to be like "ah come on, don't call me that!"
[2:34:57] <+jetjagger222> technically both have vague connections to KoF/AoF; zantetsu is eiji's ancestor, hanzo also has that brazilian ninja guy in XIV
[2:35:00] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> Nah Kotetsu isnt a boss
[2:35:08] <+ElectricFoxLex> Also short run A is super good
[2:35:18] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also on eof the character alts is like darkstalkers puppet/shadow mode
[2:35:21] <+ElectricFoxLex> Which one Woolie, the rekka or the DP?
[2:35:25] <TigerClaws12> you can do a 2nd DP in Speed mode
[2:35:37] <%Jack8274> THE PANIC WAS REAL
[2:35:38] <+gaomachine> PREDICTABO!
[2:35:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:35:43] <%SirGO0SE> WATAAAA

[2:35:44] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> kotetsu is shigens daughter
[2:35:53] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> she is the best secret character maybe ever
[2:36:03] <%Jack8274> I got bodied
[2:36:08] <majinken> @WoolieVersus also last boss has the 4 gods of north south east and west
[2:36:09] <+jetjagger222> good show dude
[2:36:09] <%Jetzord> @jack8274 Good hustle man, you did your bsst
[2:36:10] <%Jack8274> gg
[2:36:11] <rsg220> if there is any character that it makes sense doesnt know what they're doing, it's amano
[2:36:13] <%gatorafan> Something tells me all that talent to catch codes didn't translate...
[2:36:20] <%KineKithZen> Wish they made the netplay UI a litttle more consistent with the rest of the game's artstyle
[2:36:25] <%KineKithZen> It's very flat and modern

[2:46:59] <DXLelouch24> BOOOOURNS
[2:47:03] <+StriderTempxa> Easier to play.
[2:47:04] <%Irridium> easy to make
[2:47:04] <+ninja_galt> we need 50 more viewers stat
[2:47:05] <+StriderTempxa> Yep.
[2:47:06] <+jetjagger222> blame cyberconnect
[2:47:07] <+StriderTempxa> That's it
[2:47:11] <+StriderTempxa> It's just easier
[2:47:12] <@Menitta> In addition to this game getting rollback, Samurai Shodown 5 Special, Garou Mark of the Wolves, and KOF 97 Global Match got rollback
[2:47:18] <%DianaTheAscian> they seem very easy
[2:47:21] <TigerClaws12> Tenkaichi started that nonsense
[2:47:22] <%kyh9> RPGs are easy too tho. No Naruto JRPG franchise with fancy animations?
[2:47:26] <+StriderTempxa> 2D is much much more intimate
[2:47:27] <%GenesisKnight> Easier to learn and less work to do the big cool thing
[2:47:34] <%SirGO0SE> i might get in on garou now
[2:47:35] <TheGershon> they're just trying to chase the success that ninja storm had
[2:47:36] <+jetjagger222> press button, see cool siht
[2:47:37] <Mr_McFries> less work=good
[2:47:44] <%ChoculaUltra> can we get CvS2 and SVC Chaos steam ports with rollback tho????
[2:47:45] <Arek_1> Bandai Namco, using their anime licenses, just spits out arena fighters every year.
[2:47:55] <%RioGascar> basically all of snks best classic games got rollback
[2:47:56] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> 98 should be next to get rollback
[2:48:09] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> some shits gonna go down
[2:48:10] <+TungstenViper> we'll never get another All Star Battle again :(
[2:48:10] <+StriderTempxa> It also looks more like the show
[2:48:18] <%ChoculaUltra> if Bamco put a fraction of the effort that ArkSys put into DBZ into Jump Force the game could've been insane.
[2:48:23] <Zayasu> i would say its the ip's smash has but brawlhalla has like 15k players online on steam WutFace
[2:48:27] <Arek_1> Arena fighters are just cash cows.
[2:48:32] <%RioGascar> also im thankful the new ones have replaced the shitty dotemu "ports"
[2:48:41] <%Irridium> Arena fighters peaked with Anarchy Reigns
[2:48:49] <%RioGascar> i got the whole snk collection in a humble bundle and man the dotemu ones were bad
[2:48:51] <+ninja_galt> I want a 4D fighting gamer
[2:48:51] <+jetjagger222> @RioGascar i still bought those
[2:48:52] <%fuji_92> 3d arena fighters are 1v1 musous Kappa
[2:48:54] <%kyh9> I just want good Anime fighting games
[2:49:03] <+jetjagger222> regrets were had
[2:49:04] <Mr_McFries> 6D CHESS FIGHTING GAME
[2:49:09] <%kyh9> I just dream of a Bleach x SamSho game
[2:49:11] <@Solidus_113> you can make the simplification comparison, but then you have Tekken 7 that's super deep
[2:49:14] <+ninja_galt> 4d fighter would use a slowmo button like max payne
[2:49:22] <%ChoculaUltra> That one YYH fighting game by Treasure for the Sega Genesis is one of my all time favorites.
[2:49:26] <+Dreday543> Thanks for getting me into this fighting game
[2:49:26] <Shardlab> Bleach had a good set of fighters on DS

[2:54:02] <%RioGascar> the roomate was a very bad roomate
[2:54:03] <Mr_McFries> Drugs are the ultimate Akatsuki

[2:58:49] <%Grayhammatter> oof, only girl
[2:59:00] <%Wool> TURN TWITCH INTEGRATION ON
[2:59:00] <Shardlab> You get characters as you level up
[2:59:03] <Oxybe> doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype
[2:59:05] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda shocked Capcom never cashed in on the gacha game craze with a MMBN game. It would've made insane amounts of cash.
[2:59:07] <+jetjagger222> wait she does resemble the not-roll from MM9
[2:59:08] <artificiallynatural> gonna be rough the first time, but hey they reduced the difficulty spike at least
[2:59:12] <+jetjagger222> *MN9
[2:59:16] <%SirGO0SE> PVP?!

[2:59:32] <Shardlab> That difficulty has been turned down a tad
[2:59:36] <Oxybe> MMBN was 3x3
[2:59:39] <@Solidus_113> GBA Games
[2:59:43] <TheGershon> battle network was 3x3
[2:59:54] <Shardlab> They realized we all don't have Jedi reflexes
[2:59:58] <artificiallynatural> this game is much more chaotic and bullet-helly compared to battle network
[2:59:59] <%Grayhammatter> it's so good
[2:59:59] <drefizz> what was that 3d NT warrior game?
[3:00:08] <%fuji_92> MMBN IS THE BEST
[3:00:09] <Arek_1> Area Steal for more space. LUL

[3:01:03] <NiktenKing> You gotta make an optimized deck by picking and omitting spells
[3:01:05] <majinken> @WoolieVersus .EXE 1-6 was on GBA 5 had a double pack on DS
[3:01:08] <+dmtjinni> Noice PogChamp
[3:01:08] <%Grayhammatter> oh, LT to reshuffle

[3:01:30] <%tearfuldevil> im not seeing any online pvp?
[3:01:30] <NiktenKing> Once you know a character's forte, you actively try to not pick up spells

[3:02:13] <NiktenKing> There is a Baz reference in the game
[3:02:13] <%fuji_92> Theres a remake of .Exe 1 on DS with star force stuff too
[3:02:19] <huskarl_zap> is this gameplay to Strives lobby system?

[3:02:54] <Mr_McFries> DOUBLE GUNNER YOU COWARD
[3:03:01] <%tearfuldevil> then why is it on GIFG?
[3:03:04] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Do you guys want to try using my save file so you get the characters unlocked?
[3:03:07] <artificiallynatural> we can send it to you and you can drop a save into the files
[3:03:09] <%Tearonex> Fuck, woolie has all the characters I don't!
[3:03:15] <%tearfuldevil> i guess not everything has to be online
[3:03:19] <NiktenKing> Because you can still do PvP
[3:03:22] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus I could let you use my account via Family Sharing and then you can get the savefile from the cloud
[3:03:34] <%ChoculaUltra> I got my friends to play Zone of the Enders after hours of just dicking around in the Versus mode.
[3:03:34] <%Tearonex> Except for Reva, she's my girl!
[3:03:36] <@Menitta> Hazel is awesome
[3:03:50] <%ChoculaUltra> Xenogears had a stupid fun pvp mode too.

[3:04:02] <%Nekros4442> RT is a reflect
[3:04:05] <Arek_1> Omg, that reflect. Kreygasm
[3:04:06] <+Aeoneth> Reggie you have a reflect as your basic attack
[3:04:09] <Mr_McFries> SLICE
[3:04:11] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Reva has a counter as her default attack
[3:04:12] <Roasted_Pheasant> Went to search "One Step From Eden Cheats". First link is an empty Gamefaqs

[3:06:05] <%ChoculaUltra> totally worth.
[3:06:10] <Shardlab> Reggie's spells are slow, expensive, and really damaging
[3:06:11] <+bigb00gi3> the music is mega kickass btw
[3:06:11] <+Aeoneth> I abused folder reset
[3:06:16] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:06:22] <+dmtjinni> @ChoculaUltra are u me? lol cus same
[3:06:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> Reggie won and didnt even know how. you love to see it woolieREGGIEFUL
[3:06:34] <DedlokPM> @legacy0117 pretty sure most of the Battle Network games were link cable local multiplayer
[3:06:44] <+Aeoneth> Woolie your gun ony does 1 damage and Reggies char regens shield at 1 pt/s
[3:06:49] <@Menitta> this game can get super one sided lol
[3:06:51] <Mr_McFries> I love it when someone is newish to a game and then dominates
[3:06:54] <%Jack8274> LUL This is nuts
[3:06:59] <fangovafang> Reggie is learning doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[3:07:01] <%SirGO0SE> @FuqBoiSlim the reggie special woolieREGGIEFUL
[3:07:01] <%GenesisKnight> I don't remember battle network being this fast paced. Maybe I've just gotten old.
[3:07:02] <+RenoDeGeneric> Yo I didn't get to play ya earlier, but I wanted to say thanks again for the Last Blade code guys!
[3:07:08] <%ChoculaUltra> there was that one MMBN game for the gamecube that played like a classic megaman game. That shit was absurdly hard for it's time.
[3:07:24] <%SirGO0SE> SALT
[3:07:24] <Mr_McFries> GUNNER
[3:07:25] <KRaZyAmmo> what kind of game is this?
[3:07:29] <KRaZyAmmo> it looks awesome
[3:07:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hell yeah Reggie
[3:07:29] <NiktenKing> Get this game on Switch
[3:07:31] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Do you guys want to use my account so you get a save file with skins and characters unlocked?
[3:07:31] <+RenoDeGeneric> Megaman Network Transmission is STILL hard as shit. That game is brutal
[3:07:32] <+pectusumbra> mmbn in it's base game was not this crazy, it got nuts in later/post game stuff
[3:07:33] <@Menitta> Selicy is Vergil
[3:07:34] <%Jack8274> Selicy Kreygasm
[3:07:40] <@Menitta> She has summon swords
[3:07:41] <Mr_McFries> GUNNER MUST WIN
[3:07:41] <NiktenKing> It's a good portable game
[3:07:44] <%DianaTheAscian> get this game on everything
[3:07:47] <+NekoNinja13> man I would love to show off Violette to these guys
[3:07:48] <%Jack8274> Selicy, that hair, that tooth, oh my
[3:07:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> lemme check this out later then...
[3:08:00] <%KineKithZen> Zoned to fuck
[3:08:01] <+Aeoneth> This game on Switch unfortunately suffers from extreme lag on later stages because there's TOO MUCH shit being rendered for it to keep track of
[3:08:03] <%Nekros4442> Use your spells Reggie lol
[3:08:07] <Arek_1> Back when I played MMBN3 in middle school against kids in school, I cheezed with a 2xHero folder. LUL
[3:08:11] <artificiallynatural> oh no. they have no idea how to use the weapons. oh fuck my minmax
[3:08:14] <NiktenKing> Gunner is busted
[3:08:26] <fangovafang> it escalated so fast lol
[3:08:29] <@Solidus_113> this is a bad matchup
[3:08:35] <Shardlab> All that meter Reggie ain't using
[3:08:37] <artificiallynatural> blew himself up LUL
[3:08:38] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[3:08:46] <%Andrizzleton> damn some characters are just broken
[3:08:46] <staranon1> Dudes. We totally need a new Batle Network game.
[3:08:47] <NiktenKing> Selicy is really only usable with frost
[3:09:01] <Mr_McFries> @Aeoneth The ultimate downside of the switch. I really wish they would release a slightly beefed up version
[3:09:03] <%DianaTheAscian> no
[3:09:04] <+Aeoneth> Or on her invader setup
[3:09:11] <%KineKithZen> Think he figured it out boys
[3:09:14] <Arek_1> Disco Inferno folder in MMBN3 was fire.
[3:09:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> I need something play that isnt aminal corssing before the w101 remaster drops. I'll check this out
[3:09:17] <NiktenKing> Gunner's weakness is that missing basic attack shots makes you lose mana
[3:09:23] <@Menitta> If you stack frost, Selicy does 80 damage per frost
[3:09:36] <stormhawk9891> @Typhaeon I doubt they'll be figuring anything out
[3:09:48] <jubejube56> Is this fighting games?
[3:09:48] <+Aeoneth> on top of the regular 100 for a frost burst? nice
[3:09:53] <jubejube56> Looks like mega man
[3:09:55] <+dmtjinni> CLUTCH
[3:09:56] <artificiallynatural> gunner's mana gain is based on landing his shots, selicy's weapon deals damage based on how much frost she stacks
[3:09:58] <Mr_McFries> YES GUNNER
[3:10:04] <%KineKithZen> @stormhawk9891 They're figuring out how to pres butan Kappa
[3:10:07] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Did you want to try to Steam Share my Library so you get the characters and skins?
[3:10:18] <NiktenKing> Violette is the most fun to play
[3:10:18] <Arek_1> Are there Program Advances?
[3:10:20] <fangovafang> this is for real chess players NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:10:22] <+Aeoneth> Someone get Woolie a save file Stat
[3:10:28] <Manwad> if only we could see their reaction to either Violette loadouts
[3:10:29] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Arek_1 no
[3:10:30] <%Nekros4442> @Aeoneth I'm trying lol
[3:10:35] <+Aeoneth> I wanna see these chuckleheads try and play Violetta
[3:10:39] <Arek_1> @FrostedZaibatsu Aww.
[3:10:43] <artificiallynatural> I love terra. Her crowd control can be so bullshit
[3:10:45] <NiktenKing> Violette is some big brain levels of think
[3:10:49] <+pectusumbra> gotta land your spells
[3:10:53] <@Menitta> This game is like bowling but without the dice
[3:10:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:10:55] <%Wool> Melee only does damage if you apply Frost atacks first
[3:10:55] <+pectusumbra> your basic attack is not that strong
[3:10:56] <%Nekros4442> YOu have to actually use your spells
[3:11:02] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Melee damage is based on frost stacks
[3:11:12] <%Wool> Selicy does 80 damage per frost stack with her weapon
[3:11:12] <+bigb00gi3> the trick with selicy's melee is to land frost on her targets first, the melee picks it off for damage
[3:11:17] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Arek_1 there a common rare and legendary mods tho. Kinda makes up for it
[3:11:25] <%KineKithZen> Spamming light melee isn't working, better do it more
[3:11:52] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Did you want to try to Steam Share my Library so you get the characters and skins?
[3:12:01] <NiktenKing> Don't dash as Selicy. Use your frost spells first, then cash in with dash
[3:12:03] <%Wool> Saffron keeping her revive skill is pretty OD lmao
[3:12:03] <+Aeoneth> Saffron gets a 2nd wind
[3:12:33] <huskarl_zap> these thots
[3:12:45] <+Aeoneth> Gunner is a guy
[3:12:56] <%Jack8274> That shield recharges so fast!
[3:13:12] <Arek_1> I played MMBN3 and 4 as a kid. When I browsed GameFAQs back in the day, I've always heard that 2 was where it's at.
[3:13:18] <%ledshamans> ledshamans subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months!
[3:13:23] <fangovafang> lmao
[3:13:28] <KRaZyAmmo> I never played any of the MMBN games =(
[3:13:33] <Kei_Ar_> what was thename of this game again?
[3:13:38] <artificiallynatural> One step from eden
[3:13:45] <%KineKithZen> No meter vs all the meter in the world
[3:13:46] <%tearfuldevil> @KRaZyAmmo neither did I, although, wierdly, i did read the manga
[3:13:47] <+dmtjinni> Gunner is a SHE, plz check the dev teitter
[3:13:53] <+NekoNinja13> one step from eden @kei_ar_
[3:13:55] <%SirGO0SE> all the mmbn games are great to emulate on mobile
[3:13:57] <BusstaWolf> she regains shield each time she moves
[3:14:05] <Manwad> gunner's a dude, what

[3:15:45] <stormhawk9891> I know they're new but oh man this painful watch after playing it so much NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:16:03] <Manwad> yeah, 5 damage parry, yeah
[3:16:04] <+Aeoneth> They're PLaying at about a Stage 2 level while they learn
[3:16:13] <+thecmash> damn reg u good bro?
[3:16:17] <+NekoNinja13> honestly they're learning kinda fast for literally just starting
[3:16:20] <NiktenKing> Gunner spamming auto is like... scrublevel
[3:16:30] <stormhawk9891> @legacy0117 Gunner regains mp by landing shots with his normal
[3:16:36] <@Menitta> the music of this game slaps
[3:16:41] <Arek_1> Reggie would love Guts Style. LUL
[3:16:55] <NiktenKing> Violette's OST is so damn good
[3:16:55] <Shardlab> Can't mess with Phalanx
[3:17:05] <NiktenKing> Her boss fight is literally a rhythm game
[3:17:05] <Arek_1> And Woolie would love Shield Style. LUL
[3:17:09] <Shardlab> Phalanx/Hexawan build
[3:17:09] <%ekodrop> what is this megaman battle network?
[3:17:34] <+Aeoneth> basically eko
[3:17:54] <Kei_Ar_> i never got to play battle network this looks fun as hell
[3:17:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:17:55] <NiktenKing> Tank is not annoying... you just gotta use spells...
[3:17:57] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Did you want to try to Steam Share my Library so you get the characters and skins?
[3:18:13] <%Nekros4442> K
[3:18:30] <Shardlab> Ya'll are spamming your basic attack too much to build mana
[3:18:31] <%Solidnick18> strive got delayed to next year
[3:18:31] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Selicy's melee damage is based on frost stacks
[3:18:38] <KRaZyAmmo> how do they unlock more character?
[3:18:42] <huskarl_zap> GOOD
[3:18:46] <Zayasu> thank god
[3:18:50] <NiktenKing> Don't spam autos unless you are Saf
[3:18:51] <+NekoNinja13> probably security things too @nekros4442 dont worry too much about it.
[3:18:53] <Manwad> It takes like only a couple runs to unlock everyone but shopkeeper. They're unlocked after you beat them on stag 3
[3:18:56] <+Aeoneth> kill her at >Stage 4
[3:18:57] <artificiallynatural> unlock characters by beating stage four bosses
[3:19:02] <%KineKithZen> Who's the Dan of this nuts game
[3:19:14] <huskarl_zap> As of it wasnt obvious characters didn't even have voices
[3:19:15] <%Nekros4442> @NekoNinja13 most of the security problems would only be on my side but I get why he doesnt want to
[3:19:19] <+Aeoneth> Probably Shopkeeper
[3:19:22] <+dmtjinni> F
[3:19:25] <%SirGO0SE> was nice of ya to offer nekros
[3:19:27] <FrostedZaibatsu> You bombed yourself
[3:19:47] <+dmtjinni> One thing I want to know..... Where is Minh???
[3:20:03] <%SirGO0SE> @dmtjinni reading dokapon wiki Kappa
[3:20:04] <+NekoNinja13> your eyes have to be on the whole screen!
[3:20:10] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[3:20:18] <artificiallynatural> keeps blowing himself up LUL. You're supposed to cast and immediately dash to drop it in enemy territory
[3:20:22] <+bigb00gi3> the trick is to use that bomb mid-melee, so you drop it on their field
[3:20:22] <Manwad> Need eyes on you, the tiles, on the inside...
[3:21:17] <%SomersaultJustice> JOHNS
[3:21:19] <KillMyPast> This is a battle network ass battle network game
[3:21:19] <%Grayhammatter> wha happun
[3:21:26] <+brudus_maximus> fraud detected
[3:21:26] <%KineKithZen> That's a DQ Kappa
[3:21:31] <NiktenKing> Kunai build
[3:21:41] <%Nekros4442> @SirGO0SE Yeah, sadly theres no easy way to share steam saves
[3:21:43] <gordieda20> DQ Kappa
[3:21:51] <%DukeBlack_> Battle Network Successor?
[3:22:08] <NiktenKing> GO SLASHFIK
[3:22:22] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Selicy's melee damage is based on frost stacks, so use your spells and stop spamming melee
[3:22:46] <Manwad> man if you could go full phantom dust with this and select themed loadouts, that'd be so rad
[3:22:46] <lotharrio> So this is Battle Network as a fighter?
[3:22:53] <+Dogbert24> ice girl melee sucks without frost
[3:23:00] <1matheuw> battle network is the shit
[3:23:03] <%Nekros4442> Melee costs 1 mana
[3:23:04] <artificiallynatural> yup. stack frost on and then cash in with the eattack
[3:23:09] <+bigb00gi3> is it possible to press X on the character select screens?
[3:23:10] <+pectusumbra> using your melee costs mana, that's why you have no meter
[3:23:11] <%Nekros4442> On selicy
[3:23:11] <OkamiDude15> It‚Äôs battle network but the battle mode as a bonus
[3:23:18] <Shardlab> Yes
[3:23:21] <FrostedZaibatsu> @lotharrio it has a "story" mode
[3:23:27] <spardanwarrior> It's Battle Network as a roguelike, with a bonus versus mode on the side
[3:23:32] <+Xero_J> The main game is a roguelike
[3:23:37] <Kei_Ar_> woolieGASM
[3:23:37] <1matheuw> is that motherfucker named shpkeeper?
[3:23:42] <%SirGO0SE> @manwad i have a copy of phantom dust within arms reach. ive never heard anyone bring up that game before this moment
[3:23:43] <lotharrio> Interesting
[3:23:47] <artificiallynatural> will you guys play through single-player at all?
[3:23:49] <OkamiDude15> It‚Äôs battle network meets slay the spyre(?)
[3:23:50] <%Nekros4442> Co-op would be interesting lol
[3:23:51] <Shardlab> use your spells, but your unique isn't something you want to spam endlessly
[3:23:53] <+Dogbert24> you can read the descriptions on their toolkit
[3:23:54] <%0rond> it's a shame they don't have violette, she is so freaking cool
[3:24:12] <Manwad> @SirGO0SE because it's too cool and weird. Also it's free on windows, everyone should play it.
[3:24:13] <+Aeoneth> Jesus Gunner Ditto
[3:24:20] <Shardlab> The vines root enemies in place
[3:24:36] <%SirGO0SE> it is?! oh shit. im going to play this shit out of it again
[3:24:43] <%SirGO0SE> fireball variety for days
[3:24:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> !uptime
[3:24:44] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 47 minutes
[3:24:54] <OkamiDude15> This game has mod support and people have added mega man and others being in the works
[3:24:58] <Manwad> It even has online that's not garbo
[3:24:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[3:25:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> I love MMBN and i have like 70~ hrs in this game. Looks like MMBN but they are very different
[3:25:20] <+pectusumbra> agreed
[3:25:28] <OkamiDude15> The gameplay takes some getting used to but it‚Äôs fun
[3:25:39] <1matheuw> the combo tho
[3:25:39] <%0rond> it's sort of taken the basic elements of BN and took it to the extreme end
[3:25:42] <+Aeoneth> THe person who lost the 1st round gets a slowly generating shield in the 2nd
[3:25:44] <Shardlab> There ya go
[3:25:45] <+NekoNinja13> this game is alot more loose than mmbn, and that not a bad thing, just different
[3:25:49] <+Xero_J> Little side note; Gunner deals slightly more damage when reloading
[3:25:50] <NiktenKing> SLASHFIK fight
[3:25:55] <+bigb00gi3> press X after you've selected a dude when you're on the co-op character select to get a better look at their kit
[3:25:57] <MegaQuint> Definitely a lot more to keep an eye on compared to BN
[3:26:10] <NiktenKing> Slashfik fights with Gunner are so weird
[3:26:24] <Arek_1> Are there AreaGrab/AreaSteal and essentially Navi chips in this game?
[3:26:40] <%0rond> this game is a master class of UI/UX
[3:26:43] <+pectusumbra> there's no area grab and no navi type chips
[3:26:46] <Shardlab> No area stealing
[3:26:49] <%Grayhammatter> oh fuck
[3:26:53] <Shardlab> And no summons
[3:26:53] <OkamiDude15> There is time stop tho
[3:26:56] <1matheuw> hmmmm
[3:26:58] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[3:26:59] <%0rond> oh please do it
[3:27:08] <BlacSoul> we hep
[3:27:10] <1matheuw> it enables chat to fuck you i bet
[3:27:11] <%preppyposs> WOOLIE NO
[3:27:12] <%0rond> let us help
[3:27:13] <%thespacerunaway> o shit
[3:27:13] <FrostedZaibatsu> The dev balanced this game a lot since release. It use to be why more brutal. Beat story mode in 30~ hrs
[3:27:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> Stream Integration?! PogChamp
[3:27:16] <%ChoculaUltra> ooo neat, stream integration

[3:40:13] <+pectusumbra> Woolie, did you hear about the darkest dungeon PvP? Any plans to give it a shot on stream?
[3:40:13] <%0rond> they aren't going to change the lobbies. you know they won't
[3:40:18] <%omnicrescendo> delay indefinitely - make perfect game
[3:40:37] <+Aeoneth> prob more likely their polish velocity was impacted by Covid
[3:40:44] <%TheJaydedFox> @0rond Matt is actually pretty decent at smash. Everyone else in AH is hot garbage

[3:40:59] <%ChoculaUltra> you think ArcSys would ever retroactively add rollback to like DBFZ and GBVS?
[3:41:01] <@Solidus_113> That delay is long enough to make a whole new lobby
[3:41:10] <OkamiDude15> new lobby, new ui, and sol's wild throw is now a pretzal motion super that does 100% of your life
[3:41:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> So how many seconds are we betting on from when the Achievement Hunter Smash event starts and when Pat screams that Smash sucks?
[3:41:27] <KRaZyAmmo> many fighting games!
[3:41:27] <DeathByPoke7> gg strive on ps5
[3:41:33] <%0rond> AH really seemed kinda surface level ever since ray left, but I hadn't followed them too deeply so iunno
[3:41:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> @choculaultra that's up to bandai and cygames if they want to do that
[3:41:37] <%SirGO0SE> we finally have time to study the blade
[3:41:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm saying 15 seconds
[3:42:01] <OkamiDude15> whens skullgirls woolie
