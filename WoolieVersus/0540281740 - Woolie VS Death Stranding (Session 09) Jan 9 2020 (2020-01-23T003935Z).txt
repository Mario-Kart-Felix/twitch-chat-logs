[0:21:22] <%RyTYoung> @zanzibar_junker watching how pat and Woolie played it is so different, yet they fell in the same cravases which is amazing
[0:22:35] <%RyTYoung> how do you quick switch?!
[0:23:25] <$laphyrion> LOL. Gotta admit, it's kind of weird seeing people using ziplines that didn't try to make a huge network of them.
[0:23:47] <zamzoph> it's easier just to ride your bike down the length of the canyon...
[0:24:13] <Lewisisphat> i thought it would be her too...

[0:33:14] <Reizie_Etherealm> The stars, gotta get the stars
[0:33:37] <Prevot> I need pictures of otters holding hands
[0:33:38] <%Lion_kun> Ive been 5 starring all my connections. I got twice woolies bandwidth
[0:33:48] <derap41> They rape baby otters
[0:33:52] <%gatorafan> Sam Otter Bridges
[0:34:05] <%Swedish_Expert> how many maxed out s links does woolie have?
[0:34:11] <+Stupid121v2> the animal kingdom is fucked
[0:34:18] <+tuchpi> FOR GLORY
[0:34:19] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Cute (Except Rape)
[0:34:26] <Prevot> sometimes also for glory
[0:34:35] <%gatorafan> it's just arcade culture Kappa
[0:34:42] <derap41> The also drown baby otter and rape their moms sometimes the moms even allow it
[0:34:59] <%Soulbishop> @woolieversus you ever heard of a river wolf it's like a 6ft long otter that also eats crocodiles
[0:35:00] <%Lion_kun> I only have to max out heartman, veteran porter, first prepper, evobiologist and Peter Engelert.
[0:35:01] <+thesw1tch> somebody getting fuuuuuucked (get fucked, get fucked) som3body getting fuuuuuuucked
[0:35:33] <$laphyrion> I hate that this scene activates on the highway when there's NO BTs around.
[0:36:00] <+PupperFlan> T R U C K I N
[0:38:06] <+Ancopro> nono only mules
[0:38:26] <+Ancopro> but wait they still fuck with you? they shouldnt
[0:38:31] <NotHereToStream> it has to be absolutely 0 packages
[0:38:37] <%RyTYoung> what a strange premonition Woolie has set himself up for
[0:38:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:38:48] <%RyTYoung> himself
[0:38:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> The Zip Network Kreygasm
[0:39:14] <%Soulbishop> also twitch isn't very good on a Roku TV someone help me
[0:39:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yep some preppers are "story locked" on emails
[0:39:28] <+Ancopro> yup. also sometimes preppers won't join the network either until you read the email
[0:39:33] <Prevot> twitch isnt very good period
[0:39:37] <%gatorafan> I guess this explains why my orders barely take a day to get to me nowadays, new tech was discovered daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:39:40] <alrobot2014> iirc there isn't an official twitch app on roku
[0:39:46] <alrobot2014> at least anymore if there was one
[0:39:59] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Man, crazy to think kojima did this game all by himself
[0:40:01] <%Soulbishop> yeah it's an old one because my Roku in the living room won't even let me download twitch anymore
[0:40:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its also a good idea to level up the ziplines to increase their range
[0:40:14] <%jinking79> Was Woolie able to find the Veteran porter?
[0:40:30] <%Swedish_Expert> are a lot of interviews locked behind the higher levels? i got one that seemed really important when i maxed out heartman
[0:40:53] <Prevot> is that someone's mom
[0:41:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @swedish_expert some interviews are locked in certain optional missions
[0:41:14] <%Soulbishop> prevot you trying to smash
[0:41:21] <%gatorafan> stream sponsored by bombas socks Kappa
[0:41:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> mainly the "wife" reports
[0:41:25] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> @Prevot Statistically speaking, probably?
[0:41:51] <%Lion_kun> Lol i maxed out all these guys before I even got ziplines. In the end I benefited the time investment because now I got all the bandwidth for the later chapters in the mountains where the ziplines are much more essential.
[0:42:45] <+Flambage> High Quality clothes like those you can find at Bombas socks using the code Superbeast for 20% off your first order! Kappa
[0:43:45] <+dmtjinni> I love the Woolie Versus Show
[0:44:23] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> I really enjoy how this lp is just kind of reggie and woolie hanging out
[0:44:44] <+Flambage> Just 2 guys and their hiking trip across America

[0:46:53] <+heyitsdenzel_> I love Sam blank expression as he travels via zipline. Just another day for Sam.
[0:47:39] <%jinking79> just add Sugar
[0:48:10] <%Lion_kun> They also let a pair of breasts slide
[0:48:20] <%Lion_kun> And sexy gravure model shooting

[0:48:53] <%Lion_kun> And a man getting killed by a penis pump

[0:54:38] <$laphyrion> Man this mission was shit, until I played it while listening to the 'Yellow Line' track from the Redline OST. Made that mission GODLIKE.
[0:54:47] <%supersugoisenpai1> He's off the grid, so you can't zipline right to him
[0:55:18] <%Lion_kun> Wait till you have to do it on foot from timefall
[0:55:30] <%Lion_kun> Fucking champagne
[0:55:47] <+Ancopro> champagne and pizza this guy's a king
[0:56:05] <derap41> my god Kojima even has to explain keeping something leveled
[0:56:11] <%jinking79> fuck these pizza delivery
[0:56:25] <$laphyrion> Oh wait, nevermind. Thought he was delivering from the Timefall farm.
[0:56:45] <$laphyrion> This mission is easy as shit with the Highway.
[0:57:09] <+TheNewZealandStory> why does he have so many sticky guns
[0:57:09] <townzzzzz> don't flip
[0:57:15] <+Ancopro> it'll blink red if it's in a bad position

[1:03:24] <%Lion_kun> I assume the final few chapters are mostly cutscene based
[1:03:25] <AceOne5> Pro tip: after you upgrade the odek if you ping constantly you can null out Mule pings
[1:04:02] <+tuchpi> they tell you that :)
[1:04:15] <%Wiriamuzu> loving the eva colors
[1:06:09] <AceOne5> has anyone noticed the color changes on what you can customized not being consistant?

[1:24:02] <%The_Timo> Contractors aren't fully connected
[1:24:57] <AceOne5> share and share a-like
[1:27:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL bait ropes
[1:27:40] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[1:27:55] <AceOne5> rope crotch burn
[1:28:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ok now test of skill is here
[1:28:58] <AceOne5> wow so much faster the jumping thru menus
[1:29:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> TEST OF SKILL
[1:29:17] <+Ancopro> follow the arrows
[1:29:19] <+Ancopro> TRUST THEM
[1:29:34] <%The_Timo> yellow is fine
[1:29:39] <AceOne5> there is a path through but you may need a Monster halfway across
[1:29:40] <%The_Timo> don't need the ladders here
[1:29:57] <AceOne5> ladders not here
[1:29:58] <%The_Timo> Just wade through the yellow
[1:30:06] <@Solidus_113> remember that standing still in water will regen your stamina
[1:30:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wade as much as you can
[1:30:11] <%The_Timo> Right at the waterfall is all ladder needs
[1:30:14] <+Ancopro> just take it slow
[1:30:16] <AceOne5> downstream there is a structure and larger rocks for ladders
[1:30:18] <Graxe_> Just use the otter hat
[1:30:38] <NotHereToStream> infinite monster energy anyway
[1:30:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Keep on keepin on!
[1:30:49] <AceOne5> the biggest enemy here is patience
[1:31:20] <%jinking79> could have ride on the bore
[1:31:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:31:22] <%Lion_kun> Youre not wearing it
[1:31:31] <AceOne5> I bet that was adressed in early builds
[1:31:37] <@Solidus_113> Otter hat is for when you get swept away, makes it easier to wade left and right
[1:32:13] <NotHereToStream> autotoxemia means bb doesn't detect bt, but can still use odradek to scan terrains
[1:32:19] <aloveidiots> If WW3 happens and Germany is on America's side. Germany Redemption arc?
[1:32:47] <Prevot> when's america redemption arc?
[1:33:22] <AceOne5> Big piss = Big mush
[1:33:23] <Namillus> Mmm, pee biotes
[1:33:48] <RC_S3kshun8> Aloha all
[1:33:50] <RC_S3kshun8> What chapter is this?
[1:34:01] <NotHereToStream> 5
[1:34:17] <RC_S3kshun8> @NotHereToStream Thanks brotato
[1:34:43] <aloveidiots> When America defeats Iran
[1:34:45] <%jinking79> damn no one placed a zip line
[1:35:17] <Namillus> Shut it, warhawk
[1:36:05] <RC_S3kshun8> Think about how this game will be like in a year and a half or so
[1:36:09] <worldbrand> yee truckin
[1:36:12] <RC_S3kshun8> folks going and playing it for the first time
[1:36:27] <RC_S3kshun8> I wonder how long stuff will persist or if new players would get connected to old seeds
[1:36:34] <RC_S3kshun8> or if there will be no help for new folk
[1:36:43] <AceOne5> just like: kill a mule and get a voidout super quick unless you burn body
[1:36:51] <worldbrand> good question, i wonder how it is handled on the back end
[1:37:00] <%RyTYoung> ziplines and bridges have raked me in a lot of likes
[1:37:05] <RC_S3kshun8> otherwise the true best time to play was all of us at launch
[1:37:15] <Namillus> Also remember that you gradually unlock other players' stuff in each region as you play through
[1:37:16] <RC_S3kshun8> Felt like a true community experience
[1:37:27] <%The_Timo> I had an entire zipline system built over the mountains
[1:37:37] <RC_S3kshun8> @Namillus yes but if there are no folks left playing on your seed, I wonder how it'll be
[1:37:44] <+Dragoneye77> just walk 4Head
[1:37:50] <worldbrand> its possible that older stuff could get pushed forward, i dunno how they handle erasing the data or if timefall really does advance for everything in real time
[1:37:52] <RC_S3kshun8> @Namillus like for people that pick this game up for the first time in a year from now etc
[1:37:59] <%jinking79> like how it rotate like in mgs game
[1:38:23] <%RyTYoung> @rc_s3kshun8 that would be hard since you're linked to bridge links, people you connect to in the seam etc
[1:38:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1214757122967318529?s=19
[1:38:28] <NotHereToStream> sucks how timefall just erases everything
[1:38:32] <AceOne5> if ppl play this game 5 years from now there will naturally be less structures by then, and also unless the PS5 has is backwards compatible
[1:39:03] <RC_S3kshun8> @acedeone I think they confirmed PS5 will be backwards compat for 1-4
[1:39:06] <RC_S3kshun8> which is awesomesauce
[1:39:42] <LiquidMC> just passing on every death stranding streams to remind streamers to KEEP ON KEEPING ON 👍
[1:39:44] <LiquidMC> thanks porter
[1:39:53] <worldbrand> i have heard multiple sources say it's back-compat with 4 due to similar (modern) architecture
[1:40:07] <RC_S3kshun8> @LiquidMC <3
[1:40:28] <AceOne5> @RC_S3kshun8 that is great news indeed :)

[1:43:24] <worldbrand> traction is different when boosting, i think
[1:43:28] <%DensityD> then drink milk and play ping pong
[1:43:30] <AceOne5> its sucks pretty bad :/
[1:44:00] <Namillus> Roads actually seem to upgrade movement for trucks

[1:47:02] <NotHereToStream> chemicals are rare as fuck, try to find them along the way
[1:47:16] <%Lion_kun> Why is woolie wasting time doing deliveries for a 5 star connection?
[1:47:44] <%Soulbishop> How is Roku TV fucking Twitch up
[1:47:47] <AceOne5> he will be better prepared for the mountain areas
[1:48:41] <%Soulbishop> Also I gave up on cloning the hard drive Just updating chat I’m Drinkin sailor Jerry and trying to figure out what Pc I’m going to order
[1:49:07] <%Fdrank> hey chat, does the sticky gun have a purpose other than grabbing things that clipped out of bounds?
[1:49:22] <%Lion_kun> Ah sorry woolz
[1:49:32] <gamewarden92> @Fdrank You can grab shit off of mules and throw it back at them.
[1:49:39] <AceOne5> @Fdrank yea if a Mule steals your cargo
[1:49:52] <%DensityD> why is the rum always gone
[1:49:57] <%Lion_kun> Also good for taking shit in a bt zone
[1:49:58] <%Fdrank> so no command grabs then?
[1:50:03] <AceOne5> or in a pit/place you cant access easily
[1:50:13] <%Lion_kun> I once took shit from across a lake which had bts
[1:50:17] <StarlitStunner> doogYe sbfpPat doogYe
[1:50:36] <derap41> no such thing as non lethal only less than lethal
[1:50:44] <AceOne5> they dont go BT if you maim them
[1:50:45] <+DeathRube> go upstairs and put on some lotion!
[1:50:54] <%Lion_kun> That riot shotgun sure feels lethal
[1:51:07] <+heyitsdenzel_> it seems to me that mules are hatin' on Sam because he stacks paper to the ceiling and rides on 24 inch chrome
[1:51:07] <AceOne5> the one thing Kojima didnt account for lol
[1:51:12] <%DensityD> that new superhero, the old man with a bag in a chiral wheelchair
[1:51:35] <%jinking79> they did that in Star Wars
[1:51:45] <NotHereToStream> turn them into a nugget
[1:52:07] <+samsarasage> was it norman reedus all along
[1:52:18] <Prevot> how does it feeeeeel, mule, to be a bitch?
[1:52:29] <AceOne5> dont remove the sacred spark of life and then no one gets to be ghost
[1:52:38] <+samsarasage> wow this looks crazy
[1:52:50] <NotHereToStream> man, just kill me at that point
[1:52:55] <%blaggablag> Interesting. I never found deteriorated roads on my playthrough
[1:53:03] <AceOne5> KH rules say only keep the heart alive
[1:53:12] <jorniev> JUST BIO MORT THE PEOPLE
[1:53:18] <%Lion_kun> Imagine how the world would change if every death would cause a nuke.
[1:53:29] <%Lion_kun> No more wars for one thing.
[1:53:30] <Prevot> just matrix the mules
[1:53:30] <AceOne5> MORTIS
[1:53:36] <NotHereToStream> no, i'll chiral print limbs and steal package even harder
[1:53:54] <%blaggablag> You've seen mistakes into miracles, now prepare for MULES into stillmothers

[1:56:47] <+DukeBlack_> does hell exist in this world?
[1:56:54] <+Ancopro> old man yells at clouds, and the clouds went away
[1:57:57] <derap41> Just make roundabouts
[1:57:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dragkudo Your beach, or a big collective beach, can be anything. There's all those ghosts respawning in the forever war, so versions of Hell probably exist.
[1:58:48] <+linSP> playing the same cod map forever sounds like hell
[1:59:19] <%blaggablag> Wait so, these people only have two incinerators for the entire continental US?
[1:59:27] <red_blaster> Yes
[1:59:30] <NotHereToStream> ....wrong area
[1:59:37] <+linSP> one got blown up right
[1:59:40] <+tuchpi> don't think about it
[1:59:42] <%blaggablag> I can't see how that could go wrong

[2:00:04] <+DeathRube> FailFish
[2:00:12] <+linSP> you can also chuck dead bodies into tar pits from prior explosions
[2:00:19] <%blaggablag> Oh yeaaah
[2:00:24] <%jinking79> yeah this place is to burn bodies not delivery unless their dead bodies
[2:00:56] <%blaggablag> It's a brilliant garbage disposal solution if you ignore the fact you're prolly dumping crap on someone's beach

[2:03:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @notheretostream Chiral poisoning
[2:03:38] <NotHereToStream> damn
[2:04:05] <%Irridium> what if you leave a naked body in the timefall and it decomposes completely in like 5 minutes
[2:04:12] <%blaggablag> If you think about it, an incinerator and skillet ain't that far off
[2:04:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> @irridium I think that makes it necrotize into a BT even faster
[2:04:56] <kikaliq2> ye not on ciral network yet

[2:06:39] <+linSP> yeyeye samurai armor time
[2:06:54] <NotHereToStream> it can't be a kojumbo game if it doesn't have a non lethal firearm
[2:07:16] <red_blaster> This guy is Asad Qizilbash (Head of PlayStation Productions)
[2:07:22] <dukenux> Remember Sam, the silent takedown is the most (non)lethal takedown.
[2:08:15] <FstSergeant8595> Remember Sam, hydrate
[2:08:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:09:00] <+linSP> goldan sam
[2:09:01] <FstSergeant8595> I wonder what job Sam mains in FF14 Kappa
[2:09:20] <dukenux> Sam is short for Samurai
[2:09:22] <@Solidus_113> goooooooold
[2:09:32] <dukenux> fuck someone else made that joke already
[2:09:56] <@Solidus_113> what about your gold hat and glasses
[2:10:00] <+DukeBlack_> All gold on my chain
[2:10:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "I NEED POWER"
[2:10:13] <zamzoph> That green really doesn't work, though
[2:10:13] <dukenux> Elite golden legendary boot straps
[2:10:20] <NickelCanvas> love this game, forever and always Kojima
[2:10:28] <%Irridium> It's a shame you can't ever get upgraded versions of the gold stuff
[2:10:39] <+linSP> you gotta go back to the room to make the backpack gold, if its unlocked
[2:10:50] <dukenux> Good ol massive pauldrons
[2:10:52] <+Ancopro> you might inan UPCOMING mission HMM
[2:11:19] <dukenux> That's nice
[2:11:27] <dukenux> Rubber bullets never killed anyone Kappa
[2:11:41] <zamzoph> go lethal or go home
[2:11:59] <+linSP> unless you hit them in the eye, give them an infection that leads to death
[2:12:00] <Prevot> just shoot the mules in the eyes and blind them
[2:12:01] <%The_Timo> Well Aimed bola is better, but for quantity the non lethal AR is good for taking out an entire camp
[2:12:42] <+dadboy1990> They shoulda put a back pain meter on this game lol almost feel bad making dude run with what looks like a million pounds on his back.
[2:12:52] <dukenux> i think that's why some people tried to push for "less lethal" instead, cause under circumstances, a taser can also be lethal
[2:14:00] <PP_Willpower> is this a new fg
[2:14:22] <%Soulbishop> Hey not trying to be weird but I was asking earlier what island is your family from just curious

[2:17:10] <PP_Willpower> what's wrong with leaving it on the road
[2:17:31] <red_blaster> It shows up in other player's games in that spot

[2:34:35] <$laphyrion> Judging from the fact he's going through the mails, I'm guessing they're close to wrapping up this recording session?
[2:34:42] <gamewarden92> @GeneralSCPatton and now it's complete.

[2:40:28] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> That's horrible
[2:40:37] <%RyTYoung> no problem!
[2:40:46] <Andrei11Droasca> I feel like Kojima really needs a podcast
[2:41:16] <Andrei11Droasca> Since he always wants to just talk about random shit
[2:41:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This IS kojima's podcast
[2:41:26] <Prevot> Kojumbocast episode 1: "Nukes are bad"
[2:41:56] <Prevot> HERE WE GO
[2:41:56] <worldbrand> what a start

[2:42:23] <%gatorafan> Episode 3: Nukes are bad but girls are hot
[2:42:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Viral Kojimacast #4, tell me about your mother
[2:42:41] <Witherbucket> I was surprised to learn that the number of likes you get per email is based on how many are in the email
[2:42:45] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> It means doing a METRIC FUCKTON of cocaine
[2:42:51] <Andrei11Droasca> episode 4 : Monsters is good
[2:43:02] <Prevot> is there anything Freud wasn't full of shit about?
[2:43:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kojima teaching you kafka
[2:43:12] <%RyTYoung> episode 5: Doritos in the jungle anyone?
[2:43:36] <djazo> really wow
[2:43:42] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Kojima would totally do a podcast
[2:44:25] <+Ancopro> how many times we gotta do this old man
[2:45:03] <%gatorafan> Freud really needed a podcast Kappa
[2:45:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1214757122967318529?s=19
[2:45:09] <Dao_Puppy> A chiral hand is really just five dicks when you think about it.
[2:45:28] <+Taglog7> Musta been hot
[2:45:30] <+linSP> freud: sex sex sex
[2:45:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Everybody wants to bang something
[2:45:37] <%RyTYoung> I'm feeling a strong Oedipus complex in this one
[2:45:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> He dedicated his life to justifying his fetish?
[2:45:44] <Dao_Puppy> I think his dad remarried a younger woman, so...
[2:45:45] <+Taglog7> Fraud the 1st to coin the term MILF
[2:45:52] <Andrei11Droasca> I bet he did shit loads of DMT before that shit
[2:45:56] <Prevot> mrs freud must have been a milf
[2:45:59] <+Taglog7> Freud*
[2:46:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> naw im going with reggie
[2:46:20] <+Ancopro> MILF was a kaska term
[2:46:21] <+linSP> his mom mustve been hot
[2:46:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> look for girls that remind you of mom
[2:46:39] <derap41> Best part is that Girls have literal dick envy and the reason they start liking boys is because they want to fuck their dads but can't because of mom sigmund has weird fetishs
[2:46:54] <NotHereToStream> you look for the most endearing quality that you associated for most of your childhood, which are the most impressionable years of your life
[2:47:05] <+linSP> but girls have dicks theyre just really small
[2:47:07] <Prevot> man freud would be all over futa hentai
[2:47:25] <%RyTYoung> @derap41 goddamn why do they always wanna fuck their dad
[2:47:57] <derap41> @rytyoung No idea also Freud was mad into Cocaine gave it as a gift to his nieces
[2:48:31] <+linSP> people have out of body experiences and dreams of heaven because when you die your body dumps all those brain chems all at once
[2:48:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> To be fair, deciding what you want to fuck, on a basic level, is kind of made a lot more complicated with a conscious mind screwing with it
[2:49:03] <derap41> Sleep paralysis its called
[2:49:16] <%RyTYoung> @derap41 what a dope uncle
[2:49:19] <Andrei11Droasca> Depends on wat you get high
[2:49:27] <derap41> anti depressants can make that a daily occurrence
[2:49:44] <derap41> @rytyoung ....still wouldn't leave him alone with kids
[2:50:01] <Necnill> This psych has big pride for woolie describing this so well. Yeeeeeees science
[2:50:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Self awareness and critical thought are generally less important than the bits that keep your heart beating
[2:50:45] <worldbrand> vignette?
[2:50:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> neat
[2:51:16] <NotHereToStream> now you are manually breathing Kappa
[2:51:17] <Witherbucket> vignette, yeah
[2:51:29] <Andrei11Droasca> The reason for why people hallucinate during sleep paralysis is because the brain produces DMT during sleep in order to regenerate the brain cells ,its the same substance that allows us to dream
[2:52:12] <Prevot> those hallucinations are fucked
[2:52:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:52:12] <derap41> Same thing that happens when you're being slowly killed like its one of the reason animals stop struggling after they're wrestled down by predators
[2:52:52] <Prevot> horror authors WISH they could make shit as scary as sleep paralysis hallucinations
[2:53:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you're over stimulated by extremely bad shit, your brain basically has an auto shutoff, and it's called shock.
[2:53:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Zoomers
[2:53:54] <+linSP> brain says fuck the muscles
[2:53:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "oh, goody, i'm pinned by a pack of wolves and i'm being eaten alive. Peace out bitches, i'm not sticking around for this"
[2:53:59] <derap41> Building my own Climate Change shelter
[2:54:37] <+nekodelic> taking shelter in the deepest corner of ASS
[2:55:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> And then there's Vault-Tec, who'll let you into a chelter, if you don't mind some minor social experiments.
[2:55:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> :(

[3:05:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> They engineered cows or something to want to be eaten
[3:05:33] <@Solidus_113> Boiling food is a fine way to cook and eat a thing
[3:05:38] <@Solidus_113> but you gotta do it RIGHT
[3:05:39] <derap41> There was a dude that made Tacos out of his amputated food and offered some to his friend they saidd it tasted like weak pork
[3:05:54] <dukenux> As long as they're not boiled
[3:05:55] <%RyTYoung> it been a weird couple of podcasts
