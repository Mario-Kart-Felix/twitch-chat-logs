[0:01:38] <%Fetrigon> woolieFUN remember chat
[0:01:38] <%Xaeveax> Kalameet might prove tricky. I think he's got Manus in the bag though.
[0:01:46] <dexdestroyazz> The way is lit, the path is clear, we require only the strength to follow it
[0:01:52] <andre11dr> Oh yeah there's Kalameet too
[0:01:52] <Equirah> YUP
[0:01:54] <dinnydanny777> limesPoggers Armored Core lore

[0:03:17] <dundore77> i still need to finish reading monster
[0:03:22] <SivSarcast> Soul Spear Barrage in DS2 also seems like a heavily modified spread from Armored Core machine guns.
[0:03:24] <%patriotrenegade> The 1990s anime?
[0:03:24] <kh980> watching this got me to do another run of dark souls. good luck reggie!

[0:04:03] <%leith_aziz> @trackles_64 Nah, they're cultured
[0:04:07] <%leith_aziz> It's the opposite
[0:04:17] <%patriotrenegade> Pls watch/read Dorohedoro
[0:04:23] <%Xaeveax> Monster is one of the few 10/10's that exist.
[0:04:31] <%Pillagius> Pillagius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Hows' the afterglow from yesterday's stream, Reggie?
[0:04:38] <Artiamus> Just caught up to the fight with Artorias which I missed the other day, one hell of a good fight! Can't wait to see the rest of the dlc experience.
[0:04:53] <%SirGO0SE> Sup
[0:04:58] <%leith_aziz> Was it like banned in some places or just never released?
[0:05:06] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:05:09] <Wahrow> There was a SARS epidemic back when Wolf's Rain was releasing, that's why there are 4 recap episodes
[0:05:11] <%leith_aziz> (the final episodes
[0:05:18] <%Xaeveax> The ending is really really good.
[0:05:24] <+LeaIsChill> That's like Spike never getting to fight Vicious
[0:05:31] <%Prevot> that's a baseball
[0:05:38] <youngking_kush> I never watched Wolf's Rain despite looking for it on various anime sites
[0:05:44] <%Fetrigon> LUL
[0:05:46] <%cubbywolf> OH SHIT! Thats why i never finished Wolfs Rain!
[0:05:49] <%leith_aziz> Im fairly certain I've watched this oen show where the ending never aired
[0:06:01] <%leith_aziz> I feel like it's happened on several shows
[0:06:04] <+lethallunacyx> Same with fox kids back in the day
[0:06:06] <%leith_aziz> *one
[0:06:12] <+LeaIsChill> Kekkai Sensen had that, and 86 has that this season. It'll finish in March
[0:06:16] <%cubbywolf> it was the worst
[0:06:23] <%cubbywolf> the filler*
[0:06:24] <%kewlmyc> They still do it. The last two episodes of the recent anime, 86, aren't airing until March.
[0:06:24] <dundore77> is wolfs rain good? i always remember seeing episodes here and there on adult swim but never enough to actually know the story
[0:06:29] <youngking_kush> That actually sounds like the worst
[0:06:31] <andre11dr> Cable TV is the worst
[0:06:37] <%Xaeveax> The final 4 episodes of Wolfs Rain (OVA bit) are the best 4 in the whole show in my opinion.
[0:06:44] <%cubbywolf> LUL wow
[0:06:44] <youngking_kush> Like worse than regular Helsing
[0:06:51] <%cubbywolf> this makes terrible sense
[0:06:58] <%leith_aziz> Oh, so it was a expository ending? oof. Screams time-constraint
[0:07:14] <%dds333a> OG Hellshing gave is Incognito, I forgive it LUL LUL
[0:07:19] <%zanz_san> OVA planning lol
[0:07:19] <legacy0117> Yea I remember that. Was bad.
[0:07:30] <youngking_kush> @dds333a Incognito suuuuccckkkss lmao
[0:07:34] <%cubbywolf> 86 has had production delays and missed some of their airing dates, made 1 recap and 1 voice actors react episode LUL
[0:07:40] <%Xaeveax> Or Covid hits and delays a bunch of shows.
[0:07:43] <%dds333a> @youngking_kush what no Kappa
[0:07:45] <hawmaro95> Reggarth The abyss walker
[0:07:47] <%cubbywolf> the remake is having another season soon
[0:07:50] <%leith_aziz> Well no Woolie, filler arcs exist for that reason pickyProud
[0:07:51] <youngking_kush> Dhalsm lookin ass
[0:07:52] <%kewlmyc> Don't get why they don't just make an anime like a year in advance to avoid these issues
[0:07:53] <CaptainBright> I remember the day when Gundam Seed Destiny had TWO RECAP EPISODES IN A ROW
[0:07:57] <%livlinn> And thanks for that, a WHOLE GENERATION HATES SPORTS
[0:08:10] <%atlasdotwav> I look upon the Stars so bright...
[0:08:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:08:14] <+eanscrale> Remember that the OG cowboy bebop was taken off air for being too violent in reaction to a pretty sordid murder
[0:08:17] <%SirGO0SE> Monster goated
[0:08:23] <Equirah> LUL
[0:08:24] <%thefreakmuseum> what did you eat reggie

[0:08:33] <%Fetrigon> LUL
[0:08:35] <Equirah> damn, Reggie down bad LUL

[0:08:43] <+vaderxyz1970> Is this going to be the last stream?
[0:08:46] <%SaurianCrash> Woolie Souls
[0:08:49] <%cubbywolf> Reggie needs to kindle
[0:08:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I never saw Wolfs Rain but I DID see Wolfs rain megabass remix on youtube 8 years ago
[0:09:09] <Equirah> that meal wasn't dry for sure LUL

[0:09:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Damn, couldn't catch up in time, gonna have to skip some of last stream's content
[0:09:21] <%holydeviant1> Bets on missing the pendant?
[0:09:21] <Milfhunterextraodinaire> Wolie, if you enjoyed Monster, did you by any chance read 20th century boys? It's written by the same guy.
[0:09:24] <Equirah> @vaderxyz1970 possibly depending on how it goes
[0:09:25] <+vaderxyz1970> nice
[0:09:25] <%dds333a> This'll be the first DS stream I catch too, so if it's the final, so be it LUL
[0:09:30] <%atlasdotwav> @xaeveax It's the like burning sands to cross into OG weeb status lol
[0:09:34] <+LeaIsChill> Reggie comes in "So I did some grinding"
[0:09:37] <Dotados> It's literally the last zone

[0:10:49] <Darren716> Oh shit we're starting already
[0:10:55] <LVL1_Scumbag> Artorias is a badass

[0:11:26] <youngking_kush> Reggarth is an INSPIRATION
[0:11:28] <%kewlmyc> Reggie the MOTIVATOR
[0:11:29] <%leith_aziz> @Chatterbox1991 Dont really understand the emotes, but yeah, they're cute and varied
[0:11:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Artorias is the coolest guy, that's objective fact
[0:11:34] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> awwwww
[0:11:42] <Voidvas> THE WALL
[0:11:49] <%kewlmyc> \o/
[0:11:50] <+swesterly> Gunna fight artorias I’ll post the video later….I got my ass kicked I ain’t posting that shit
[0:11:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> DO YOU HEAR THE VOICES, CHEERING FOR YOU???
[0:11:50] <MeImoth> artorias is REAL
[0:11:52] <peachy996> You've made great progress in every session.
[0:11:52] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's all we wanted
[0:11:53] <andre11dr> Damn ,my man said DAYS
[0:11:55] <Arqartur0> Raeggarth, the Steel Boar Run
[0:11:55] <%leith_aziz> Do Yo Understando?
[0:11:57] <Darren716> Cant go through it
[0:11:59] <%Vigonept> SOURCE OF DETERMINATION
[0:11:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> Walker of the Abyss, Clapper of Undead Cheeks
[0:11:59] <%dds333a> He's not too tough Kappa
[0:12:00] <+LeaIsChill> if you say so :)
[0:12:02] <+HumanDoctor> yeah 4 months here
[0:12:02] <Darren716> Cant go over it
[0:12:02] <AbnormalVoid> it took me a really long time my first time, but I was also doing a dagger run like a dumbass LUL
[0:12:04] <Wahrow> I don't think it's the final session
[0:12:07] <Darren716> Know that you've found, the wall
[0:12:07] <%Lightwolfe> I'm raising my hands to give you my energy
[0:12:17] <+eanscrale> This happens in every game too, Bloodborne and DaS3 have some CRAZY nonsense
[0:12:25] <andre11dr> Artorias took me like 5 hours the first time  Reggies built is really good
[0:12:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yo that free estus timing
[0:12:31] <%Pillagius> Now... For Reggie - try to realize what comes next, since you're to fight the guy who fucked up Artorias before you fought him.
[0:12:34] <+RustyCoyoteA> Hang in there, Reggie. There’s a reason we all remember him.
[0:12:35] <Johannen> NotLikeThis Orphan of Kos
[0:12:41] <Artiamus> He should take the time to go get Artorias' armor set.
[0:12:42] <%dds333a> perfectly timed message LUL
[0:12:42] <%leith_aziz> @eanscrale the eye in the underground... pickyStare
[0:12:45] <dundore77> also every session you beat bosses. People spend days running against them. also you do it without bitching out and grinding a fuckton to make it easier
[0:12:50] <%Xaeveax> @Johannen Took me like 20-30 tries. Super hard but super fun.
[0:12:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> its fiiiiine
[0:12:54] <Voidvas> You hear the cries of your Friends, You are filled with DETERMINATION
[0:12:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's fine, Reggie, don't worry about it spyCappa
[0:12:57] <hawmaro95> Manus is even harder than arotrias tbh NotLikeThis
[0:12:59] <%holydeviant1> Everyone in Oolacile's having a GREAT TIME
[0:13:02] <%Pillagius> it's the PvP area. Lots of bloodstains
[0:13:02] <srv4254> basscannon was here
[0:13:03] <foghornleghorn55> pvp. the true final boss
[0:13:06] <+ElBuraindo> I watched my friend play the game the way you two are doing it, once he got Smough's armor and hammer he just plowed through the rest of the content, even Artorias... it was so disappointing
[0:13:19] <%dds333a> The cripple scientist
[0:13:22] <LunarRemix> Guile theme playing on the background as people are hard PvPing
[0:13:22] <%leith_aziz> Is Orphan of Kos suppoused to be the most bull one, or was that someone else?
[0:13:27] <%holydeviant1> @ElBuraindo Poise tanking is hilarious
[0:13:29] <dizimous> If it takes me 6 hours to beat a boss, I wear that as a badge of pride because I stuck with it
[0:13:31] <andre11dr> Orphan the one that feels kinda BS ,like why does he have no stamina?
[0:13:33] <+vaderxyz1970> Rewarded for being a bitch.....
[0:13:37] <%atlasdotwav> How's it feeel bequeathed lord
[0:13:50] <%Xaeveax> @andre11dr He's super easy to read though, since it's such a pattern. Takes forever to learn it though.
[0:13:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Nito makes so little sense
[0:13:52] <Darren716> It's real fuckin nito
[0:13:55] <peachy996> @andre11dr cuz he's a nightmarish horrible being
[0:13:56] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr Stamina works differently for enemies in these games than it does for players
[0:13:56] <%leith_aziz> @andre11dr He aint human in teh first place pickySmug
[0:14:05] <peachy996> Once you learn Orphan you're set
[0:14:07] <Voidvas> Orphan of Kos is the Artorias of Bloodborne
[0:14:11] <youngking_kush> First of the Dead is either the coolest name or the lamest name depending on perspective
[0:14:12] <dundore77> he's also one of the few (only?) to not split his soul
[0:14:18] <%leith_aziz> @A_German_spy Yes, but all enemies still use stamina like you, EXCEPT for Kos
[0:14:24] <%dds333a> recap
[0:14:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> So is every lord soul weak and drained compared to what it was at first?
[0:14:29] <Chatterbox1991> @leith_aziz Kos is bullshit because he doesn't have an internalized stamina bar the way every other boss does; meaning he can just constantly attack without issue
[0:14:41] <Johannen> @dundore77 Still got spent on natural heat death of the universe
[0:14:47] <%dds333a> @reallybigrocks in some cases, yes
[0:14:48] <%leith_aziz> yeah, ok its what I thought
[0:14:54] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz Enemies only use stamina for calculating when their guard is broken. Their stamina has no effect on how often they attack or act.
[0:14:56] <%Prevot> First of the Dead implies things can only die because he exists
[0:14:59] <andre11dr> @a_german_spy I know but most bosses have a spot where they back off for a second, Orphan doesn't really do that zhe just keeps swinging
[0:15:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1473170438847090689
[0:15:22] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr Yeah, all I'm saying is that stamina doesn't factor into that. It's determined entirely by the enemy's AI script.
[0:15:23] <%leith_aziz> @A_German_spy Hmmm...
[0:15:24] <%dds333a> Nito essentially created, and personified death by being the first to die
[0:15:24] <%Xaeveax> I love all the screaming going on in the background during this discussion.
[0:15:26] <LVL1_Scumbag> Why is there no heat soul and cold soul?
[0:15:29] <%paladinstarbuster> Plague just did an episode on DS the otherday and he summed it up pretty well
[0:15:42] <%Pillagius> I wonder if the First Flame was just some Omega Ancient Dragon fiery fart
[0:15:48] <%SirGO0SE> Orphan is the only souls boss so deep in a game that  still causes  people  to quit imo
[0:15:57] <+LeaIsChill> Low in calories Soul
[0:16:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> @dds333a Nito was like "Fuck it" *invents death*
[0:16:02] <+vaderxyz1970> Sunlight for life
[0:16:05] <%dds333a> gets sick lightning bolts
[0:16:14] <KeiganOfAstora> I'm just a few minutes late, what did I miss?
[0:16:31] <Johannen> Discusing lore
[0:16:32] <%A_German_spy> @SirGO0SE Orphan is one of the worst offenders, and is the epitome of the design philosophy Fromsoft tried so hard to force into the subsequent games
[0:16:39] <youngking_kush> Death and Decay
[0:16:39] <+LeaIsChill> @KeiganOfAstora They're casually breaking down all lore after beating Arty last time
[0:16:43] <peachy996> What about the Funky soul?
[0:16:43] <KeiganOfAstora> I was about to finish The Matrix Resurrections and realized Woolie is streaming
[0:16:44] <%atlasdotwav> @keiganofastora woolieLORE
[0:16:44] <Equirah> She tried to rekindle the fire *because* it had the power of life
[0:16:46] <Voidvas> The Furtive Pygmy so Easily Forgotten
[0:16:50] <peachy996> Who holds the soul of dance?
[0:16:51] <KeiganOfAstora> Fuck they beat artorias! I missed the end
[0:16:59] <%dds333a> @voidvas who?
[0:17:03] <%leith_aziz> pickyIsee (this is not sarcasm. Im intruiged)
[0:17:04] <KeiganOfAstora> I missed the last hour last night
[0:17:05] <%Pillagius> The strange thing - description of Witch Soul says "More than enough to satiate Lordvessel"... If it's "more than enough" - why would we need the other souls?
[0:17:05] <%Prevot> funny how the easily forgotten got the titular Dark Soul huh
[0:17:07] <%DreamCancel01> @peachy996 ME lacPls
[0:17:12] <%dds333a> shambling corpse pile
[0:17:16] <Artiamus> Nito is a dozen skeletons in a trenchcoat.
[0:17:18] <mikash91> One of his legs is a dragon's and its cool as fuck
[0:17:27] <youngking_kush> It made him Zeus
[0:17:27] <dude_bruhh> demon of hatred changes a man
[0:17:38] <+Shishi1205> @Pillagius I think the implication is that not all souls are able to be used by the lordvessel
[0:17:39] <Johannen> Energy
[0:17:45] <+vaderxyz1970> It's pretty much a miniature Sun
[0:17:50] <youngking_kush> UNLIMITED POWAH
[0:17:51] <%Pillagius> @Pillagius probably
[0:17:54] <KeiganOfAstora> All souls were created equal
[0:17:56] <+Shishi1205> @Pillagius Ergo only some souls can be offered to the lordvessel
[0:17:56] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Light is weightless while Dark has Physical Mass
[0:18:08] <available_line> With great pwoer
[0:18:09] <%superc37> not a miniature sun, it IS the sun
[0:18:18] <%cubbywolf> dyson sphere of the first flame
[0:18:22] <drunken_lemur> Reggie should not watch Plague's latest video
[0:18:23] <KeiganOfAstora> @superc37 Doc Ock?
[0:18:24] <%dds333a> They deposed them, and the age of fire began (there's a bit more I'm skipping Kappa)
[0:18:30] <%Tearonex> So easily forgotten
[0:18:31] <+LeaIsChill> responsibility with power comes great
[0:18:32] <%Xaeveax> So easily forgotten
[0:18:34] <%Prevot> didn't Kaathe say what it was
[0:18:35] <youngking_kush> He couldn't defeat the Dragons though, he had to learn Lightning from Seathe
[0:18:35] <KeiganOfAstora> Forgot who?
[0:18:38] <drunken_lemur> @Xaeveax Who is?
[0:18:39] <%Pillagius> Woolie, I'm pretty sure Gwyn got himself The Lord Soul that he later shared with his knights and Seath
[0:18:43] <%leith_aziz> I might check a Dark Souls lore video one day. Woolie's GG lore series already proved im into this sort of shit pickyPog
[0:18:43] <%cubbywolf> i blanked out for a second and now im lost
[0:18:44] <%Xaeveax> @Xaeveax I forgot
[0:18:46] <available_line> Dwyndolin?
[0:18:48] <andre11dr> Who dat boy
[0:18:56] <Arqartur0> IS DAT BOI
[0:19:05] <youngking_kush> Seathe the Scaleless, so easily forgotten lol
[0:19:07] <%dds333a> Literally the society they know is ending
[0:19:08] <KeiganOfAstora> Woolie like all of us have no idea what the fuck is going on and kinda guess
[0:19:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> Good ol Dwindlin' Gwyndolin
[0:19:16] <%Xaeveax> @youngking_kush No, you stop that right now
[0:19:25] <youngking_kush> lmfao
[0:19:32] <%A_German_spy> @youngking_kush LUL
[0:19:45] <peachy996> This is why I appreciate BB's story
[0:19:49] <available_line> Woolie they literally moved bosses between rooms that's how nonexistent the lore is.
[0:19:49] <Equirah> @Pillagius they're all Lord Souls, but Gwyn decided to share his while the pthers kept thiers
[0:19:55] <%dds333a> keep that cycle alive
[0:19:56] <Equirah> fucking typos
[0:20:02] <%Xaeveax> @peachy996 Same
[0:20:06] <+eanscrale> Soon the flames will fade... but not until from completed its three game contract with bandai namco.
[0:20:08] <andre11dr> I wonder if Elden Ring lore will be convoluted like this or more straight forward
[0:20:08] <%Prevot> @peachy996 you like BLUUUUUUUD?
[0:20:16] <Voidvas> DARKLORDS 4 LYFE
[0:20:19] <+Jiggisnipe> get this dark party goin
[0:20:19] <%cubbywolf> DARK SOUL!
[0:20:21] <%superc37> theyre afraid of humans taking their place in the world
[0:20:21] <%dds333a> @andre11dr I fucking wonder Kappa
[0:20:22] <%leith_aziz> @andre11dr Shouldnt the leaks give an idea?
[0:20:22] <drunken_lemur> I hate these new Twitch pop up ads
[0:20:23] <LVL1_Scumbag> The gods fear the age of man
[0:20:26] <%atlasdotwav> What's that smell??? Is BLUUD
[0:20:26] <youngking_kush> The funniest part is hes using his sword right now
[0:20:26] <+vaderxyz1970> @eanscrale And included DLC
[0:20:29] <peachy996> There's a fair amount of backstory if you want to get into it but really: just go out and hunt a few beasts. It's for your own good.
[0:20:29] <@Menitta> ah he said it
[0:20:30] <KeiganOfAstora> Man... I really need another PeachSaliva Dark Souls 3 stream soon
[0:20:32] <+mechslayer71> oh wow, fast start today. was expecting to still see the art loading screen
[0:20:34] <brunoberserk> JOHN DARK SOULS
[0:20:41] <%JustToWatch> who?
[0:20:44] <KeiganOfAstora> @mechslayer71 I thought they'd still be chillin pre-game
[0:20:45] <%Fetrigon> So easily forgotten
[0:20:50] <%cubbywolf> *blink*
[0:20:50] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus How about the original name of Dark Ring ^_^
[0:20:51] <%leith_aziz> @peachy996 Is that a metaphor for touch grass?
[0:20:51] <%patriotrenegade> To be fair, New Londo didn't look like a fun time
[0:20:53] <%dds333a> Giving that shit to somebody is mich better than both, although linking it turns you into a badass
[0:20:56] <%Fetrigon> RING OF FIRE
[0:21:01] <KeiganOfAstora> STOP
[0:21:03] <+Shishi1205> a BRAND
[0:21:04] <AnonymousNate_> After Sekiro I'm interested to see how they tell the Elden Ring story considering they actually had a narrative to Sekiro's story
[0:21:06] <%cubbywolf> it burns burns burns. the ring of fire
[0:21:08] <%Pillagius> @Pillagius Well, The Lord Soul as in most powerful one. Like there was so much it was enough to establish country, share with it and even create the Curse of Undead and First Flame that he fed for a while
[0:21:11] <KeiganOfAstora> Now he's explaining DS3 DLC lore, whoa. Way ahead of things dude
[0:21:13] <%paladinstarbuster> humans get beefy in the dark
[0:21:16] <KeiganOfAstora> That's DS3 lore dude
[0:21:17] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz The thing about the leaks is that they're almost certain to contain a bunch of cut content. How convoluted Elden Ring's lore is will depend partly on how much of that content, and which parts, actually make it in.
[0:21:26] <%cubbywolf> ds3 connects to ds
[0:21:28] <%leith_aziz> So im assuming all DS games are connected?
[0:21:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> The abyss is a problem
[0:21:32] <Voidvas> Dark Bad; Light Good upboats to the left
[0:21:36] <peachy996> @KeiganOfAstora Where is she in the DLC anyway, I kinda don't blame her for holding off so long
[0:21:37] <+Shishi1205> @leith_aziz kinda
[0:21:39] <%Xaeveax> @leith_aziz Yes, though 2 is a bit more out there
[0:21:40] <kookaburragangwar> @leith_aziz Nyes, retroactivly
[0:21:41] <Darren716> Cant Woolie explain this during gameplay?
[0:21:42] <Rawbone_saw> @leith_aziz yup
[0:21:43] <Treasure_Vault> Weird time to bring up DS3 reveals
[0:21:43] <+Shishi1205> DS2 is weird
[0:21:44] <youngking_kush> @leith_aziz Yes
[0:21:48] <%cubbywolf> everyone just ignores 2
[0:21:49] <%Prevot> DS2 is not THAT connected
[0:21:53] <dizimous> Bro I fucming hate when my government traps me in a ring of fire
[0:21:53] <peachy996> Cuz it's just sitting there, waiting to kick Paige's ass lol
[0:21:58] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz They're connected via retcons in each subsequent game.
[0:22:01] <%jinking79> jinking79 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 36 month streak! turns out the reason SNK stop using k9999 was a ruse the Legal Issues around him were a lie SNK just didn't like K9999's design sounds really dumb the more u think about it. Good luck Reggie and happy Xmas everyone
[0:22:01] <KeiganOfAstora> @peachy996 Ringed City. I don't know if she beat the Demon Prince boss or not but yea. That's gonna take her awhile
[0:22:03] <Rawbone_saw> @cubbywolf i know i sure do!
[0:22:04] <%Prevot> DS2 is like a filler arc
[0:22:10] <%leith_aziz> @A_German_spy Maybe. My question is (and this might sound weird): do you care if it's convoluted if you find learning about it interesting?
[0:22:12] <Equirah> @Prevot think about what little plot it has
[0:22:19] <%leith_aziz> Thanks, chat
[0:22:22] <%Fetrigon> @anonymousnate_ I'm pretty sure Elden Ring is going to be a franchise, seeing as they have a lore bible created by GRRM.
[0:22:22] <%Xaeveax> @Prevot A filler are with some very pretty scenery and a simpler story.
[0:22:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:23] <%leith_aziz> pickyEZ
[0:22:31] <andre11dr> DS2 is more about the Kingdom and the giants and that stuff
[0:22:35] <%cubbywolf> the many sacrafices will be in vain, but were they even needed in the first place?
[0:22:48] <%cubbywolf> WHO IS GWYN
[0:22:48] <%Seancicle> Seancicle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! o7 Recently reached the end of DS3 near the time Reggie got to Gwinn 👌🏻 Reggie, thank you for helping me keep up with my French studies. We're almost ready to see what the next year will give to us 🫂 See you around Otaku
[0:22:48] <%Pillagius> @Prevot and hilariously OP sorcery :D
[0:22:50] <%dds333a> There are plenty of extraneous things too Kappa
[0:22:52] <LVL1_Scumbag> What ISN'T unclear?
[0:22:53] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz Heh, well, everyone you ask will give you a different answer to that. For me, I gave up caring about lore ever since DS2 when the retcons started happening.
[0:22:54] <%Prevot> DS2 is a case where it would definitely be better as a standalone game
[0:22:54] <%SaurianCrash> ds3 isnt ds1 and is more a remember this story kinda of thing
[0:22:57] <Artiamus> Did he meet Hawkeye last session?
[0:22:59] <+vaderxyz1970> Yah does Elizabeth FUCK?

[0:23:01] <Treasure_Vault> Hey Reggie, what's humanity?
[0:23:05] <%superc37> the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten...
[0:23:09] <youngking_kush> They pray to Gwyn and his family
[0:23:10] <andre11dr> Also DS2 give Manus a bunch of daughters witch....i don't know how to feel about
[0:23:15] <hawmaro95> DS3 is the actual sequel to DS1
[0:23:15] <+Shishi1205> Carim too
[0:23:16] <%dds333a> Llyod boys
[0:23:16] <Darren716> ResidentSleeper
[0:23:18] <%cubbywolf> What is good and what is evil?
[0:23:19] <%Fetrigon> @anonymousnate_ that shit, is not your everyday napkin sketch. LUL
[0:23:23] <Treasure_Vault> Like anyone knows anything about dark souls, yeah right
[0:23:25] <KeiganOfAstora> Regions, kingdoms, call it whatever you want
[0:23:35] <%Fetrigon> *average everyday
[0:23:43] <%dds333a> And his big hat
[0:23:43] <KeiganOfAstora> Do you guys think Reggie can beat the game today? DLC only has two more bosses and the path down isn't that long
[0:23:45] <%tigerfang86> people DO vibe with being undead
[0:23:46] <youngking_kush> Lordran is the Land of the Gods
[0:23:49] <Equirah> they're not turning undead here, they're being changed by humanity
[0:23:49] <%tigerfang86> but it's still being undead
[0:23:55] <%leith_aziz> @A_German_spy I appreciate your answer as an outsider to DS. My problem is simply when people go "only psychopaths enjoy (insert game) lore". That's a pretty self-centered take.
[0:24:03] <AnonymousNate_> @fetrigon Yeah with that kind of effort put into the lore it would probably be a waste not to explore the concept thoroughly
[0:24:04] <%tigerfang86> but here, this is some DANK DARK SHIT so far
[0:24:08] <Rawbone_saw> yes describing these game's narrative as "arcs" and "seasons" isnt really doing it justice. these games have WEEEIRD storytelling, it's cool and unconventional
[0:24:12] <peachy996> @KeiganOfAstora He's got the time. I think he can do it
[0:24:13] <youngking_kush> It's like above the other lands, that's why theres 2 layers of clouds
[0:24:14] <%cubbywolf> all the story is around the game and the game is just the connecting part of the middle to the end
[0:24:15] <Johannen> @Equirah Talking about Lordran in general not OOlacile
[0:24:26] <%MajorCrasher> and woolie though they'd finish today when he's lore dumping lol
[0:24:35] <%superc37> depends on how much trouble he has with said bosses tbh. hell, i can see him spending an ebtire stream trying to get kalameets tail cut bc of how bs it is
[0:24:37] <andre11dr> DS3 at least actually answers so questions from DS1 ,DS2 just says "yeah we forgot about a bunch of things lol"
[0:24:39] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz Ahh, sounds like you've run afoul of the gatekeepers.
[0:24:41] <%cubbywolf> keep it in mind LUL i'd have to remember it first
[0:24:41] <%Prevot> monkaS
[0:24:43] <%leith_aziz> @Rawbone_saw I watch JoJo and play Guilty Gear. That's par for the course for me, and I enjoy every second of i.t
[0:24:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> have i missed much gameplay?

[0:24:59] <%Xaeveax> Intro cutscene with context
[0:25:04] <%SaurianCrash> the first game isnt linked to anything, cause ds2 n ds3 wasnt thought of so its not a really a follow up
[0:25:05] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz At the very least, try to remember not to take those sorts of takes too seriously.
[0:25:06] <KeiganOfAstora> Why not just pull it up on YouTube?

[0:25:19] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz To be honest, I'm more concerned about the gameplay, because as long as that's good, I don't absolutely need the lore to make sense.

[0:25:29] <AnonymousNate_> DS1 intro still remains the best From intro imo
[0:25:32] <Darren716> Hasn't Woolie repeated the intro like 5 times by now?
[0:25:32] <KeiganOfAstora> @Artiamus He could put the browser up on the stream
[0:25:36] <KeiganOfAstora> Oh well this works lol
[0:25:40] <%atlasdotwav> Now go let the legend come back to life
[0:25:40] <Tempmael> we even got this skull

[0:28:52] <%MajorCrasher> I feel like just putting on a lore video from that one guy would have explained better. I'm still confused
[0:28:54] <%A_German_spy> @kewlmyc She bears a striking resemblance to Anastacia of Astora
[0:28:58] <%leith_aziz> Cool
[0:28:59] <%cubbywolf> that rock dragon getting rocked was cool
[0:29:15] <peachy996> Sunlight FO LYFE!
[0:29:18] <deeriojim> @vaderxyz1970 yeah, thats why I started to wonder, does that mean his throat and teeth has scales on the inside?
[0:29:23] <+Mendin> Long May The Sun Shine
[0:29:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:29:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[0:29:29] <%superc37> @deeriojim if you get his tail cut and look at the stump, youll notice that his bones have the scales instead of skin, which is probs why he lacks the same immortality that the dragons d
[0:29:29] <%hax_metatron> That character will stay in jail forever.
[0:29:30] <youngking_kush> Yes
[0:29:32] <%Fetrigon> ye

[0:29:46] <youngking_kush> @cubbywolf It is until DS3
[0:29:54] <Treasure_Vault> @cubbywolf replace "dark sign" with almost anything. what the fuck is humanity
[0:29:55] <andre11dr> You have the Dark Sign ,you can read its description
[0:29:57] <%cubbywolf> DS3 confuses me
[0:30:05] <ShogunRaven> did reggie finish DS1 :O?
[0:30:05] <%cubbywolf> i can never say whats better, fire or dark
[0:30:08] <%A_German_spy> @kewlmyc That's the one
[0:30:10] <%Prevot> symbiote shit
[0:30:11] <%leith_aziz> I will probably at one point rewatch this playthrough or watch another with full effort if I ever get into Souls games. These are interesting games
[0:30:13] <%cubbywolf> we in the ds1 dlc
[0:30:13] <Visorak6> the abyss is GOOP
[0:30:14] <%SaurianCrash> the first time i saw this, i thought that the dark sign was the hollow's eye V:
[0:30:17] <youngking_kush> @woolieversus Have him look at a Humanity
[0:30:20] <%dds333a> also, yeah, for the individual who asked, all the lords looked like pygmies beforehand

[0:30:31] <%superc37> humanity is Dark. Drak refined by the flame.
[0:30:32] <%dds333a> at least, how I interpret it
[0:30:38] <%superc37> dark*
[0:30:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat i popped in halfway to the intro what is woolie explaining to him?
[0:30:41] <%leith_aziz> For now, it's kinda akward since I missed most of the playthrough because of time zones
[0:30:45] <%cubbywolf> ew nature
[0:30:46] <%superc37> lore stuff
[0:30:46] <+beansoup> RULES OF NATURE
[0:30:47] <Treasure_Vault> Revolution is a threat to the monarchy

[0:30:48] <thinktank1> RULES OF NATURE
[0:30:51] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz They're worth trying out as long as you don't decide to try streaming your first playthrough spyCappa

[0:30:53] <+eanscrale> Standing here... I REALIZE

[0:31:04] <%cubbywolf> dragon shield
[0:31:04] <leomuratore> Rules of Nature!!!
[0:31:05] <%leith_aziz> @A_German_spy Im not a streamer pickySmug

[0:31:20] <%A_German_spy> @leith_aziz Just a joke. Mostly.
[0:31:34] <%SaurianCrash> @Darren716 he does it so well
[0:31:38] <%Prevot> @Darren716 a 3 hour plague video? LUL
[0:31:42] <%cubbywolf> warping through the bonfire, while needed, is confusing. A list of names isnt very intuative
[0:31:53] <%dds333a> calmer at least
[0:31:56] <%MajorCrasher> honestly yeah I should just go watch Vaati for lore LUL
[0:31:57] <deeriojim> Im not sure she cares all that much about Artorias

[0:32:02] <%cubbywolf> everything will be fiiiiiine
[0:32:06] <%leith_aziz> Mushroom lady pickyLurk
[0:32:06] <andre11dr> Basically the natural cycle of the world is the fire fades ,the gods lose power, and man take over ,than DS3 implies that after the Dark a new world gets born
[0:32:08] <peachy996> I ask that you put yourself on a pizza
[0:32:08] <Voidvas> Mushroom Narrator
[0:32:10] <%SirGO0SE> Has Reggie seen the plague vid?
[0:32:10] <%kewlmyc> Just noticed that Bloodborne does the same "time travel" gimmick with their DLC
[0:32:10] <%dds333a> Kappa
[0:32:11] <klooswep> BOP
[0:32:12] <Equirah> @cubbywolf neither, it's a natural progression and the game is about people being afraid of losing power and doing anything to hold on to it, even fuck up the things they're trying to protect, to stop the inevitable
[0:32:15] <%cubbywolf> time to get high eating magic mushroom people

[1:26:29] <%dds333a> these guys are all the same, dash into DP
[1:26:39] <Treasure_Vault> Room with two dark sorcerers, the doorway halfway down the stairs in that room. It's the way to the item.
[1:26:48] <%A_German_spy> @patriotrenegade Ahh, gotcha. Then yeah, something like the Crescent Falchion will be your best bet for the moment.
[1:26:54] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:26:59] <+CrimsonDio11> Im brain farting which came out first DS3 or BB?

[1:27:07] <%A_German_spy> @CrimsonDio11 Bloodborne
[1:27:07] <andre11dr> BB
[1:27:08] <youngking_kush> BB
[1:27:18] <youngking_kush> BB 2015, DS3 2017
[1:27:23] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Should be another way on the inside of the building
[1:27:25] <%dds333a> Thats why people called DS3 Blododborne souls LUL
[1:27:26] <andre11dr> BB was 2016 ,DS3 was 2017
[1:27:41] <Darren716> BB was 15, 3 was 16
[1:27:41] <Treasure_Vault> So I'm just gonna keep saying. Go back into the dark room with two sorcerers at the bottom. Halfway down the stairs, through the door, check the ledge.
[1:27:46] <andre11dr> Or wait, no ,BB was 3015
[1:27:46] <+Baldzinga> @Darren716 This
[1:27:48] <BurdRightsActivist> DS3 was 2018, BB was 2017
[1:27:50] <%MrATheGreat> did we get ppunked by woolieONEGUY

[1:28:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bloodborne came out in 1997

[1:37:35] <AbnormalVoid> better with strength catalysts
[1:37:35] <%patriotrenegade> youre better off with a soul arrow variation @WoolieVersus

[1:38:37] <%A_German_spy> @vaderxyz1970 You'd think, but "dark" in DS1 isn't a distinct element; it's just split physical and magic damage.

[1:42:09] <lyzejag> Just wear the hat dude
[1:42:12] <deeriojim> tbh though, you can see the chest from outside
[1:42:12] <%MajorCrasher> walk with the helmet LUL
[1:42:19] <+Mendin> Where's the Bead

[1:42:29] <%patriotrenegade> wow one whole red titanite chunk totes worth it

[1:42:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> Be the change you want to see in the world
[1:42:44] <andre11dr> Just tie the helmet around your waste
[1:42:52] <Pie_Mastyr> I think the intention was that you'd look over and see the chest then start trying shit
[1:43:08] <youngking_kush> There's a jump behind you
[1:43:12] <%JetpackMcQuack> this goddamn place
[1:43:19] <subjectg> and often the shit you try first is to jump, so quite a few people completely bypass the puzzle here
[1:43:21] <youngking_kush> Back in the other room
[1:43:32] <%MajorCrasher> there's so much shit to try though. and it's completely possible to miss the first light message
[1:43:34] <deeriojim> did he do the jump?
[1:43:58] <%MajorCrasher> I tried that jump like 20 times I don't believe it's possible
[1:44:12] <%dds333a> I think it is
[1:44:15] <youngking_kush> It is lol
[1:44:15] <subjectg> @majorcrasher it is possible
[1:44:23] <andre11dr> It totally is

[2:01:28] <+AngryHomunculus> Wasn't there dialogue that said he's friends with the giant blacksmith?
[2:01:32] <derap41> It was a mercy killing
[2:01:33] <dundore77> Artorios needed put down
[2:01:33] <subjectg> and ornstein’s jerking off with dragons
[2:01:40] <+swesterly> yeah hmm where was ornstein
[2:01:43] <+Mendin> You stopped Artorias before he completely flipped and went on a rampage and became known as a fallen knight
[2:01:44] <%A_German_spy> @dds333a Ornstein knew what he was signing up for
[2:01:44] <%Prevot> @AngryHomunculus maybe after kalameet?
[2:01:44] <derap41> You Didn't Win Over Artorias
[2:01:48] <+TopTieramisu> ornstein was stuck training the intern
[2:01:50] <Marhunter7> Ornstein went to hang out with a cool dude
[2:01:50] <%MrATheGreat> BTW if you beat Kalameet without Gough grounding him Gough has special dialogue for you
[2:01:55] <deeriojim> Ornstein is the only one of the Four who is still in Anor Londo who is NOT helping with the Abyss

[2:05:28] <%MrATheGreat> Make Gough-Senpai proud
[2:05:28] <emptyantics> Does cutting off the tail give you the Evil Ring?
[2:05:29] <dundore77> didn't woolie not do this boss on his playthrough on the old channel?
[2:05:30] <%superc37> waif does woolie know about the incredibly bs tailcut?
[2:05:33] <+Jiggisnipe> still can

[2:06:08] <Aydarkzero> you handle it i'm going to sleep

[2:07:25] <%Irridium> I don't believe but I like to live dangerously
[2:07:30] <%Catpurnicus> maybe next time I'll make a build that can use it
[2:07:34] <SGrim> @Catpurnicus 3 of the 7 Kalameet fights I've done, I got the tail
[2:07:41] <+Grayhammatter> for real for real?
[2:07:44] <+warlockwithapixie> Imagine if he get it

[2:09:55] <+Mrbaconator> he built different

[2:10:20] <+Baldzinga> Midir a ho
[2:10:21] <Marhunter7> "just who do you think i am!" - kalameet probably
[2:10:24] <emptyantics> Midir is such bullshit
[2:10:26] <legacy0117> Magic or lightning. Fire and Dark are useless on Kal.
[2:10:28] <subjectg> kalameet’s weakest resistance is technically lightning, it’s just that all his defenses are BIG
[2:10:30] <andre11dr> @reverend_roscoe Midir is a better fight, but in NG + he takes 7 years to die
[2:10:33] <SGrim> Midir's theme is so fucking good though
[2:10:37] <%MrATheGreat> You know what I just realized? Kalameet started all of this and yet the one knight they kept back was the guy literally named Dragonslayer LUL
[2:10:41] <%Prevot> will Elden Ring have the first good dragon boss? LUL
[2:10:47] <%patriotrenegade> He's proto-Midir
[2:10:51] <deeriojim> fun little detail: Kalameet has 3 eyes, 2 small normal eyes then the big glowing on in the middle
[2:10:51] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I mean in a fight between Midir and Kalameet, who wins?
[2:10:55] <DSD24> DT

[2:17:51] <+even_the_yuenglings> do it tho
[2:17:52] <karawra> valid
[2:17:53] <Voidvas> Reasonable
[2:17:56] <%Irridium> legit took an hour last time I did this
[2:17:57] <waltzqueen> fair
[2:17:57] <%Suneater_Jerome> fuck that tail cut
[2:17:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> 0% yea LUL
[2:18:00] <+LeaIsChill> If you're swinging anyway tho
[2:18:00] <%HeroToxiko> HeroToxiko subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! one shot lets goooooo
[2:18:00] <youngking_kush> Valid
[2:18:01] <%MrATheGreat> I will Kappa
[2:18:01] <Equirah> I do Kappa
[2:18:04] <%Prevot> I've still never gotten it
[2:18:05] <agustorm123> He knows
[2:18:05] <%xyxlzyzm> everyone always asks "what is kalameet" but no one ever asks "HOW is kalameet"
[2:18:06] <%justcallmebobplease> Go for the flex, Reggie!
[2:18:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> getting his tail sucks too so fair
[2:18:07] <%SaintBeau> i have NEVER gotten the tail cut
[2:18:08] <jett_eyes> Moonlight Greatsword was the only one he needed anyway
[2:18:08] <%Prevot> fuck that shit
[2:18:12] <%Bread_Assassin> Kalameet's tail is prime for Crystal Magic Weapon usage.
[2:18:13] <%hax_metatron> Kalameet tail is the hardest boss of DS1 no joke
[2:18:13] <jorniev> OK SOME PEOPLE WILL
[2:18:16] <%MajorCrasher> honestly fuck it, I never got that tail cut either
[2:18:16] <%jonblnt> I'll think lesser
[2:18:17] <andre11dr> Oh no,will be here forever now
[2:18:19] <%xyxlzyzm> being an immortal dragon is stressful u kno
[2:18:19] <klooswep> It is a super hard tail cut to get. I remember it took me like, over an hour to get (but then again I was using melee)
[2:18:19] <%MechArch> but it would be cool if you did tho Kappa
[2:18:20] <Marhunter7> @subjectg lets be real... the camera is the true hardest boss... with gravity as the 2nd place
[2:18:20] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Knowing Reggie, he'll cut the tail by accident anyway.
[2:18:22] <%Prevot> yeah MLGS is the only must have tail weapon
[2:18:28] <pacboi97> wait what sword is that
[2:18:29] <+Jiggisnipe> Spy is right
[2:18:32] <+even_the_yuenglings> can you shoot it off with arrows?
[2:18:39] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:18:40] <jett_eyes> there's like one move where the tail is low enough
[2:18:40] <%jonblnt> get the tail i believe
[2:18:42] <emptyantics> He will
[2:18:43] <waltzqueen> Lucky Reg will get it on the winning run
[2:18:50] <deeriojim> I think the first time I cut Kalameets tail I spent 30 minutes in one fight with him.
[2:18:52] <agustorm123> 2020Drop
[2:18:54] <subjectg> that dive is the only opportunity you get
[2:18:54] <%SaintBeau> so is that
[2:18:58] <andre11dr> I actually really like the Obsidian Sword, probably my favorite Dragon weapon
[2:19:00] <legacy0117> So yeah, most people grind a LOT before trying to fight Kal. Unfortunately livestream  limits how much grinding is done.
[2:19:03] <+king_of_mystery2> I once spent an entire fight with this guy, got him to like 10% health only hitting the tail, and never got it, I ran out of estus and died.
[2:19:03] <%patriotrenegade> but is it enough?
[2:19:06] <%SaintBeau> range
[2:19:19] <youngking_kush> With 8 Soul Spears & 4 CSS he can kill him with all magic
[2:19:24] <Marhunter7> The best trick i know to fight this dragon, is to not lock on and just free aim it... the X Y axis lock on rolling makes dodging some of his attacks way harder
[2:19:25] <dundore77> hes also somehow dodging it with his movements
[2:19:29] <+even_the_yuenglings> his stand range is 20 meters
[2:19:30] <subjectg> I beat kalameet at sl 70 and got the tail cut. His moveset is not thst great actually
[2:19:46] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:19:47] <agustorm123> Why is he fighting him long range?
[2:19:48] <+vaderxyz1970> Reggie doing the promethus school of running away from the fire
[2:19:50] <velgaduere> LUL
[2:19:50] <%A_German_spy> LUL
[2:19:50] <subjectg> there’s one move that can trap you but he does it very rarely
[2:19:52] <deeriojim> read the message
[2:19:58] <moonmintparadise> His spreads max range is just enough to keep you out of it
[2:20:04] <derap41> Good effort little buddy
[2:20:09] <+eanscrale> I still can't believe speedrunners found a blind spot to cheese him
[2:20:10] <%HeroToxiko> WAIT actually one shot?
[2:20:10] <+even_the_yuenglings> the magic does work holy shit
[2:20:10] <dundore77> imagine if he can fly off the cliff and ceaseless discharge himself
[2:20:14] <%Cozy90> !uptime
[2:20:15] <@Moobot> @Cozy90 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 27 minutes
[2:20:22] <klooswep> I bet that dark breath smells like some rank shit
[2:20:23] <%holydeviant1> Greatbow sniping might just be viable, actually, if you bait out the fire JUST right
[2:20:35] <%tigerfang86> GET LIT
[2:20:37] <%patriotrenegade> Is the telekinetic attack at 50%?
[2:20:42] <+Bitscreed> Classic dragon move
[2:20:49] <andre11dr> Still no Magneto powers iet

[2:20:55] <DSD24> Slow walking on you
[2:20:55] <deeriojim> @patriotrenegade I think he can do it at any time
[2:21:00] <%SaintBeau> vineSpin
[2:21:01] <%xyxlzyzm> @holydeviant1 you can. you make him do the forward breath or sweepy one and quickly aim from the side
[2:21:03] <andre11dr> I wanna hear that terrible noise
[2:21:05] <emptyantics> I WANT HIM TO DO THE GRAB ATTACK
[2:21:07] <%HeroToxiko> imagine melee range fighting kalameet LUL
[2:21:09] <+Undenizen> You gotta stop dodging directly away from his face.
[2:21:12] <%MajorCrasher> @patriotrenegade it's random. he did it to me at the beginning once
[2:21:14] <+trinto2> damn NO damage from that sword
[2:21:14] <%Cozy90> CUT DAT BUTT
[2:21:18] <%X2Eliah> needs more soulspears
[2:21:19] <%HeroToxiko> he gon cross u up
[2:21:25] <subjectg> Why does he have fire tempest attuned LUL
[2:21:25] <AbnormalVoid> teeny tiny damage
[2:21:27] <agustorm123> This might be it
[2:21:27] <%hax_metatron> Chat, did Reggie get hit by THAT MOVE by Kalameet?
[2:21:28] <youngking_kush> I'm surprised he hasn't used his command grab yet
[2:21:31] <+even_the_yuenglings> kalameet has counters
[2:21:31] <%TheOddJik> would the catchpole be better?
[2:21:31] <moonmintparadise> he needs to kindle those bonfires
[2:21:32] <%MrATheGreat> yeah that sword does nothinbg compared to the soul spear
[2:21:33] <+JingKaisean> damn, gotta get up in dat ass

[2:23:10] <Th3rd3> the tail spin
[2:23:11] <%Suneater_Jerome> good ass try
[2:23:11] <%forsakenpoyo> too good not to clip - https://clips.twitch.tv/AttractiveUgliestShingleNinjaGrumpy-RddhHH80LbU72Hqv
[2:23:15] <stevenellis386> is reggie gonna go for the tail?
[2:23:15] <Marhunter7> Legit, fighting him unlocked is way easier to dodge attacks for melee
[2:23:17] <%kimbucha> has anyone managed to lure Kalameet off the edge of the arena? does he die or is there an invisible wall for him
[2:23:18] <velgaduere> time to bring HCS back
[2:23:21] <Pie_Mastyr> he missed like 3 of his crystal ss
[2:23:23] <%HeroToxiko> Kalameet rushdown confirmed
[2:23:23] <+Jiggisnipe> of course he did miss spells too
[2:23:25] <+Undenizen> not even half! he missed like 60% of his shots.

[2:23:26] <klooswep> It's still gonna be a while, but Reggie is learning Kalameet's attacks pretty quickly
[2:23:30] <Dabrikishaw> That was my last bet dudes. I got 5 of these right in a row and Reggie is getting too good at fighting Kalammet to keep that up
[2:23:33] <%X2Eliah> homing mass maybe
[2:23:37] <klooswep> It's just that he has like, 50 attacks
[2:23:39] <%Xaeveax> Now I believe
[2:23:40] <moonmintparadise> homing mass for sure
[2:23:47] <%A_German_spy> @X2Eliah It's useless against a boss as mobile as Kalameet
[2:23:49] <%holydeviant1> Two attempts, for sure
[2:23:49] <GeoGio3> I wanna see em get hyped with the command grab
[2:23:51] <+even_the_yuenglings> I BELIEVE
[2:23:52] <%holydeviant1> Maybe three
[2:23:57] <%X2Eliah> @A_German_spy hmm yeah true
[2:24:06] <%tigerfang86> hunting dragons
[2:24:10] <%tigerfang86> the GREATEST OF SPORTS
[2:24:17] <SGrim> I believe in try 10
[2:24:21] <%X2Eliah> piss dark
[2:24:26] <%X2Eliah> basically
[2:24:53] <xxHungryxx> The only time kalameet spits fire is when he freestyles
[2:24:53] <%Cozy90> just got here. he do manus yet?
[2:24:54] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I guarantee you'll be glad you did this.
[2:24:57] <andre11dr> Reggie should kill the Moonlight knightess and get a better Estus
[2:24:57] <Treasure_Vault> His fire is physical and magic damage, right?
[2:24:58] <%Catpurnicus> dark pyro
[2:24:59] <%MrATheGreat> might as well buy everything from him now so you can wrap griggs up
[2:25:05] <%A_German_spy> @Cozy90 Hasn't see him yet. On Kalameet now.
[2:25:18] <%Cozy90> @a_german_spy thanks!
[2:25:18] <Josef_Stryker> Did Reggie already beat Manus? Or is he just doing Kalameet first?
[2:25:22] <%MajorCrasher> @treasure_vault yep
[2:25:25] <%tigerfang86> Magic is huge
[2:25:25] <youngking_kush> I'm surprised he never bought Fall Control
[2:25:27] <Josef_Stryker> And I take it Reggie is trying to cut his tail?
[2:25:30] <+even_the_yuenglings> I never use armor in souls boss fights, it holds me back LuL
[2:25:33] <%MajorCrasher> Kalameet first
[2:25:40] <%kimbucha> @WoolieVersus a plunging attack is possible on Kalameet
[2:25:42] <youngking_kush> That's why I never use Stones
[2:25:45] <agustorm123> @josef_stryker Too hard for him
[2:25:46] <legacy0117> Might have been harsh for 20 tries, but he is definitely improving.
[2:25:46] <%A_German_spy> Now that's more like it!
[2:25:47] <%Catpurnicus> yeah reggie would benefit a lot from a fast roll build
[2:25:48] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @even_the_yuenglings nice name LUL
[2:25:55] <%Catpurnicus> since he's trying to roll out of attacks instead of blocking
[2:26:02] <emptyantics> That’s alot of DMG
[2:26:05] <%Catpurnicus> and he's fighting proto-bloodborne speed bosses
[2:26:11] <rasamune> Become the Cannon
[2:26:13] <andre11dr> LOAD
[2:26:18] <emptyantics> Become the RAILGUN
[2:26:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> don't go back to pre artorius
[2:26:25] <Tempmael> kalameet has those gapclosers
[2:26:35] <+parazoa42> "Do not, my friends, become accustomed to the taste of magic."
[2:26:38] <%Catpurnicus> he also needs the grass shield
[2:26:43] <rasamune> Frame data is still real even at 100 feet
[2:26:49] <DSD24> That's why Punch Wizards are the best
[2:26:56] <emptyantics> Magic is good but in moderation
[2:26:58] <primaryfire> magic is inherently respectless
[2:26:59] <DSD24> You steal those turns and then go IN
[2:27:01] <+even_the_yuenglings> yeah put on the grass shield for extra stams
[2:27:01] <legacy0117> This oughta be good. The int on our boi is pretty high.
[2:27:10] <%tigerfang86> Wizards have NO MORALS
[2:27:12] <%Prevot> speaking of which, yesterday I fought Nameless King for the first time and boy, he goes down like a BITCH to magic
[2:27:20] <leomuratore> Always fighting with the brain
[2:27:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> DO IT FOR GOUGH
[2:27:29] <crackedhappiness> im guessing round 12
[2:27:34] <%X2Eliah> So question... do Scholar of first sin, or skip straight to 3?
[2:27:35] <%holydeviant1> @Prevot The man lost the Annals, he's not the smartest
[2:27:41] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Gough believes in you, even if most of chat is betting against you LUL
[2:27:44] <andre11dr> We still haven't seen him use Jedi powers, no awful noises iet
[2:27:44] <youngking_kush> @prevot He does, especially Dark magic
[2:27:48] <DSD24> The Nameless has such a cool design
[2:27:51] <+Standard_Enemy> YOU GOT THIS

[2:28:02] <%Prevot> @holydeviant1 he really should have stuck around to see the stuff Seath was doing LUL
[2:28:05] <+even_the_yuenglings> Im all in monkaS
[2:28:06] <moonmintparadise> @hax_metatron no
[2:28:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @a_german_spy I'm rooting for Reggie, I just know free money when I see it
[2:28:07] <deeriojim> @hax_metatron dont think so
[2:28:07] <%TheOddJik> @X2Eliah they arent skipping any
[2:28:07] <%holydeviant1> @A_German_spy I'd be impressed if I lost all my points today
[2:28:08] <resloxxx> @X2Eliah Scholar of the first sin has aldia so I wouldnt want him to miss it
[2:28:13] <@Menitta> Aight I gotta go. Good luck Reggie and my early congratulations on beating Dark Souls! This was a really fun playthrough to watch.
[2:28:18] <%A_German_spy> @abelincoln_catpuncher Hey, I'm not judging LUL
[2:28:20] <derap41> Dodging like mad
[2:28:24] <+Breaknoon> i dont think he's gotten hit with the psychic command grab yet
[2:28:25] <klooswep> Hawkdog
[2:28:25] <yeildingthought> Is this Reggie’s last fight here or one more?
[2:28:25] <+Bitscreed> 0 - 1 Feral Boars
[2:28:29] <%X2Eliah> you dont think SotFS won't be too hard?
[2:28:34] <%patriotrenegade> DO the grab you fuck
[2:28:34] <%holydeviant1> Boars fuck up everything! There's a reason they needed special spears!
[2:28:42] <+even_the_yuenglings> reggie is gonna hate ds2 LuL
[2:28:42] <+Baldzinga> @yeildingthought Technically has two more fights after this one

[2:29:09] <klooswep> I still think of Elajjaz referring to the head-slam attack as "giraffe neck slam"
[2:29:09] <@Menitta> @king_of_mystery2  I got a LOTTA PROBLEMS WITH YOU PEOPLE
[2:29:10] <yeildingthought> @baldzinga Ah! Good, thought I missed the end of the dlc here
[2:29:13] <+even_the_yuenglings> good zoning
[2:29:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:29:17] <%Xaeveax> Reggie's got this now
[2:29:19] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> I think chopping Kalameet’s tail is harder than the fight itself but I take nothing away from him. He’s not a pushover
[2:29:19] <%MrATheGreat> oh he may hace this
[2:29:23] <%HeroToxiko> The ground really felt that
[2:29:24] <+Standard_Enemy> Battle of zoners
[2:29:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> is he good to switch catalysts yet?
[2:29:26] <Josef_Stryker> I take it the tail is considered a lost cause for Reggie?

[2:31:48] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If you want to extend the duration of Power Within, you can swap out Havel's Ring for Lingering Dragoncrest, if you don't mind shedding some weight. It'll extend Power Within from 100 seconds to 150.
[2:31:49] <+Mrbaconator> need to power within the crystal soul spears
[2:31:52] <crackedhappiness> he got cocky there but still did good
[2:31:57] <%MooseIsGoose> also remember your R2
[2:31:57] <+thefancywig> some REALLY good rolls that round too tho
[2:31:57] <moonmintparadise> we are getting there

[2:32:04] <+even_the_yuenglings> break the wrist, walk away
[2:32:05] <emptyantics> Watch that new Plagueofgripes video, makes one appreciate this game even more
[2:32:05] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus And it won't increase the HP damage you take from the buff.
[2:32:21] <Johannen> Just gotta use Power Within on your best spells like Crystal Spear
[2:32:21] <agustorm123> Now this is a bet

[2:36:31] <%A_German_spy> @dundore77 Although in 1.0, casting Power Within using an upgraded pyro flame WOULD increase its self-damage. Fortunately they fixed that early on.

[2:38:52] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:38:53] <+Malysitos> I wonder, does anyone else think Kalameet is the hardest boss of DS1?
[2:39:04] <velgaduere> @Malysitos many do
[2:39:10] <subjectg> @malysitos not me
[2:39:12] <deeriojim> I find Manus harder
[2:39:13] <OkamiDude15> COUNTER
[2:39:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> COUNTER
[2:39:17] <+Breaknoon> Kalameet is a real mf
[2:39:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> his turn Sadge
[2:39:18] <SGrim> @Malysitos There is no one even close
[2:39:19] <%kewlmyc> BURN BABY BURN
[2:39:21] <%X2Eliah> oh no this is getting worse xD
[2:39:21] <%SaintBeau> manus is harder for me
[2:39:22] <%Irridium> @Malysitos his tail is the hardest boss of ds1
[2:39:22] <+Baldzinga> @Malysitos I personally think a certain boss, without using a certain item, is the hardest
[2:39:22] <leomuratore> COUNTER
[2:39:25] <youngking_kush> @malysitos Manny is harder IMO
[2:39:25] <%A_German_spy> @Malysitos Not when Capra Demon exists spyCappa
[2:39:32] <%JetpackMcQuack> book an appointment
[2:39:34] <%MajorCrasher> @malysitos he's 2nd hardest to me
[2:39:35] <pyjama_day> I find the sanctuary guardian harder than manus and kalameet >_>''
[2:39:37] <+Breaknoon> I'd say Manus is worst
[2:39:37] <ChaosDunk119> Reggie mashing when he know he aint plus
[2:39:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kindergarden teacher Woolie
[2:39:38] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> I hate how obvious that dive looks but it can still hit
[2:39:44] <+LeaIsChill> That's Reggie's magician showing
[2:39:45] <DSD24> Capra demon and his devil dogs
[2:39:45] <%MajorCrasher> Manus tore me a new one
[2:39:45] <emptyantics> Manny is literally a BB boss
[2:39:52] <subjectg> I think buffed artorias is the hardest of the actual bossfights
[2:39:59] <+Breaknoon> Cleric Demon
[2:40:07] <subjectg> mostly because he’s the only one that can one-shot you
[2:40:12] <+Breaknoon> Beast*
[2:40:16] <glass_marcus> Manus is harder close range, but as long as you don't cqc him the entire time he's fine
[2:40:17] <+Mr_Pylon> Bed of Chaos for sure the hardest boss, but most of that is from how dumb it is
[2:40:18] <ShubRAngerrth> @Malysitos Bed of Chaos was harder for me, but that was my own fault, missreading the fight.
[2:40:20] <SuperGoblinPunch> Has he got the Tail cut yet?
[2:40:26] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> I found Manus to be the most difficult
[2:40:28] <%MajorCrasher> Manus can absolutely one shot you with his rage attack

[2:49:42] <%Catpurnicus> cutting off the tail does help a bit
[2:49:42] <JairusHopesItWorks> *sick
[2:49:44] <+Malysitos> I wonder this implies that Kalameet has been taking double damage this entire time
[2:49:45] <klooswep> Melee users hang out by the ballsack, same as every boss
[2:49:46] <emptyantics> Only real CHADS rock that ring
[2:49:47] <%Xaeveax> He spotted it!
[2:49:48] <KeiganOfAstora> That's why the ring is double damage, it's a reference to that
[2:49:49] <@Solidus_113> reggie got eyes

[2:50:33] <AnonymousNate_> Black Iron shield is a godsend in this fight. Big fire resistance and doesn't take up your whole equip burden like Havel's
[2:50:36] <%Xaeveax> Fog rendering issue on that chest.

[2:51:38] <Johannen> @A_German_spy Does upgrading shields cost a slab?
[2:51:38] <Marhunter7> Fighting him without lock on in melee also helps alot because it basically gives you rolling thats not locked to the X and Y axis
[2:51:42] <%SaintBeau> LESS THAN USELESS
[2:51:43] <%Grimlockfly> REGGIE WENT KALAMEET FIRST? GOTDAM
[2:51:44] <%justcallmebobplease> Has Reggie seen Manus, or did he B-line straight to Kalameet after Artorias

[2:52:18] <%superc37> oh btw did woolie read the description of the tailcut weapon reggie missed?
[2:52:19] <%MrATheGreat> The real reward comes when you cut the tail, casual
[2:52:19] <leomuratore> The game never stops the bullshit
[2:52:19] <emptyantics> CBT RING
[2:52:22] <dundore77> are there critical builds?
[2:52:23] <%MechArch> it doesn't go on the finger
[2:52:25] <+LeaIsChill> one more :)
[2:52:25] <+Zxander93> @WoolieVersus Should probably also let Reggie know he didn't get Kalameet's tail cut
[2:52:26] <jett_eyes> oh shit, he beat him
[2:52:28] <urkleturtle> the real reward is his tail weapon, which SLAPS
[2:52:32] <velgaduere> one of the best dragon fights in the series
[2:52:35] <%justcallmebobplease> @justcallmebobplease Oh, then he also hasn't seen that unique prisoner enemy yet either, right?  Fun.
[2:52:38] <gabs423456> I think theres just 1 boss fight that is harder in this game tbh
[2:52:38] <youngking_kush> @zxander93 He knows
[2:52:40] <jett_eyes> did he get the tail xD
[2:52:49] <xxHungryxx> Doesn't Kalameet have the most moves for a DS boss?
[2:52:50] <moonmintparadise> @jett_eyes nah
[2:52:54] <leomuratore> That's the game being a sore loser by giving you an item that you take double damage.
[2:52:55] <ShubRAngerrth> that deprived Kalameet lyfe!
[2:52:56] <Johannen> Kalameet Tail description got anything interesting?
[2:52:57] <irlGlitch> Kalameet's pretty easy tbh pieShrug
[2:52:59] <+Malysitos> @mecharch 😏
[2:52:59] <Dopamien> @velgaduere there's not much competition tbh calebKek
[2:52:59] <primaryfire> let gough know about kalameet
[2:53:01] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Even using magic for this fight isn't what I'd call laming it out. You still have to learn the moves. You still have to time your actions right. You still need to know the spacing. You ACED this, Reggie.
[2:53:04] <jett_eyes> expected
[2:53:04] <emptyantics> Next boss is gonna be interesting
[2:53:05] <~WoolieVersus> @Zxander93 we already did

[2:54:16] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus They are, but that's partly because this is a PvP area LUL
[2:54:18] <Johannen> Does Reggie forgot about White Dragon Breath he has?
[2:54:18] <%dds333a> yup
[2:54:22] <%superc37> Oh and fun fact, you get special dialogue from gough if you beat him WITHOUT asking for his help
[2:54:23] <jorniev> except porbably the dudes who wear that calamity ring
[2:54:27] <dundore77> and not getting hit while using a ddr pad
[2:54:29] <velgaduere> @Johannen doesn't have enough INT to use it

[2:54:31] <agustorm123> Yep
[2:54:33] <+YseCrack> SL1 no pyro BSS
[2:54:38] <gabs423456> I honestly feel like Artorias was harder for me than Kalameet
[2:54:41] <andre11dr> You can beat the game without attacking
[2:54:41] <Johannen> @velgaduere Isnt he close thou?
[2:54:45] <emptyantics> Lvl 1 no shiggy diggy

[2:54:54] <agustorm123> Dudes we have seen the same videos LUL
[2:54:55] <%Bread_Assassin> I mean with teleportation, you really only need a couple of bonfires kindled. Just teleport to a kindled bonfire, rest, then teleport back.
[2:54:56] <KayleNikita> that 24 vit LUL
[2:54:58] <dundore77> more int more damage

[2:59:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's absolutely the giant, tho
[2:59:29] <%Ensign_Epic> It's giant blacksmith though, that's why the Hawk Ring is behind him
[2:59:31] <%SaintBeau> the giant has the Hawk ring
[2:59:31] <AbnormalVoid> it's the giant, because he'd only want to talk about forge
[2:59:33] <LunarRemix> It's the giant. He even gives him his Hawk Ring
[2:59:33] <+theoldone001> Nah it's the giant blacksmith, he has Gough's ring next to him

[3:00:14] <xxHungryxx> it's a cock ring
[3:00:21] <klooswep> The 4 OGs
[3:00:22] <AbnormalVoid> Giant doesn't want to talk because he wants to forge, but Gough wants to talk to him about craftsmanship, which the giant blacksmith would like @WoolieVersus
[3:00:25] <velgaduere> @xxHungryxx Cockeye Gough?
[3:00:26] <srv4254> isnt he not blind but has resin on his helmet

[3:03:56] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus See the resin coming out of his helmet
[3:04:06] <+BelricPsytar> @Anderobot clearly going over your head...hes not blind he just thinks he is
[3:04:06] <subjectg> @owlboy7 i think the implication is that while gough may be eloquent, he still isn’t that smart, i guess it’s a giant thing
[3:04:07] <%livlinn> D:
[3:04:09] <velgaduere> @Anderobot he THINKS he's blind, because he never removes the helm
[3:04:12] <derap41> Gough is not smart he's wise
[3:04:14] <%justcallmebobplease> @derap41 ...Now I'm imagining Gough using Gwyn's lightning bolts for archery purposes - Faith is kinda the Wisdom equivalent in this game, if one squints.
[3:04:16] <%dds333a> @anderobot because we have no basis to assume he is blind
[3:04:17] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Crazy, right? LUL
[3:04:20] <+terry_quest> never thought to take off his helmet?
[3:04:20] <Johannen> How did Woolie forgot that detail)

[3:04:26] <%Irridium> he's like a skyrim npc that had a barrel put on their head

[3:04:28] <%dds333a> LUL
[3:04:28] <%Ensign_Epic> @Anderobot He CAN be, but the way this is set up, it's clearly meant to show he's not blind, but was just fucked with

[3:04:31] <%MajorCrasher> "ay bro take off your helmet"
[3:04:32] <GeoGio3> It was given as an honor, he won't take it off
[3:04:32] <%MrATheGreat> @dundore77 Yeah but then he wouldn't be able to style on them as hard

[3:04:49] <Dopamien> thats not wise lmao hes just dumb
[3:04:53] <Dotados> It's a very classical myth style
[3:04:55] <dinnydanny777> His head must be stinky
[3:04:56] <andre11dr> Wait ,would he be able to see the light beneath his helm?
[3:05:02] <%superc37> like i could totally see this happening to dionysus or some shit
[3:05:04] <NeroInfinite> It's why pirates wore eye patches, so one eye could have night vision
[3:05:05] <%holydeviant1> He doesn't want to take it off, because it's symbolic of Gwyns acceptance of him. He's proud of his knighthood.
[3:05:07] <legacy0117> Weird.
[3:05:08] <%FrostedZaibatsu> You can go blind if you live in complete darkness for a while

[3:11:56] <Treasure_Vault> good to have options tho
[3:12:02] <%Ensign_Epic> @jett_eyes It's a possibility, but likely not
[3:12:08] <$eco419> @jett_eyes not likely
[3:12:09] <+Grayhammatter> getting those rocks
[3:12:12] <+Malysitos> The only issue is that it kinda leave him stationary for attacks
[3:12:14] <leomuratore> Can he beat the game today?
[3:12:28] <santietch> those are some bloodborne looking dudes
[3:12:29] <youngking_kush> @leomuratore Totally, depending how Manny goes
[3:12:32] <%Javaa01> @leomuratore He can, but it'd be closing in on like a 6 hour session if he did
[3:12:33] <%MajorCrasher> if only there was a pendant that deflected dark
[3:12:34] <%townzzzzz> ENTER
[3:12:40] <%Ensign_Epic> because let's be real - final boss is gonna be a PUSHOVER
[3:12:43] <+Grayhammatter> EXECUTED
[3:12:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> @leomuratore Can he, yes. But probably not depending on Manus
[3:12:44] <subjectg> This dude is the bane of randomizer runs

[3:14:14] <%MooseIsGoose> A metal dude that might of been a boss at one time
[3:14:17] <%Ensign_Epic> it drops the entire chain set

[3:14:27] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus "Chained Prisoner"
[3:14:27] <derap41> An enemy they didn't want to trash but didn't have a use for
[3:14:29] <+warlockwithapixie> In this not-a-boss-room
[3:14:30] <dinnydanny777> So that means it was probably a human if it dropped a helmet I guess
[3:14:40] <Johannen> Was this dude the only enemy that droped chain armor at some point?

[3:40:26] <BurdRightsActivist> @AbnormalVoid No.
[3:40:28] <%A_German_spy> @cobalt_phoenix_ It's completely stupid. It's the entire reason they nerfed magic in every Souls game after this.
[3:40:48] <%A_German_spy> @cobalt_phoenix_ EXCEPT, bizarrely, for dark magic in DS2... which had the exact same problem
[3:40:48] <AbnormalVoid> now up
[3:41:10] <Marhunter7> @A_German_spy Im still sad that hexes in DS2 are so expensive stat investment wise and are only viable so late in the game... same with DS3.
[3:41:19] <AbnormalVoid> now down again lol
[3:41:35] <subjectg> @a_german_spy at the very least, dark bead and climax were easier to dodge
[3:41:38] <youngking_kush> This is the entrance
[3:41:51] <agustorm123> Thats a lot humanity
[3:41:59] <Treasure_Vault> an SOS
[3:42:00] <subjectg> but if you got parried into climax you were fucked
[3:42:04] <%A_German_spy> @Marhunter7 It's a common problem, unfortunately... particularly among Japanese developers, it seems, but it exists everywhere. They fall into the trap of nerfing things that are strong instead of buffing things that are weak.
[3:42:04] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> I remember getting one shot by that same enemy

[3:48:08] <$hattrick61> whats the return policy on those stones?
[3:48:09] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Reggie, I think you're the first person I've EVER seen jump through that particular series of mental hoops and arrive at that particular conclusion
[3:48:09] <+Baldzinga> Reggie thought he was playing a platformer LUL

[3:48:26] <TigerClaws12> they should have fogged the drop LUL
[3:48:27] <%kewlmyc> To be fair, that should 100% be an endless abyss, not have a seeable floor
[3:48:30] <+Jiggisnipe> not even a bait, there was what appeared to be enemy and the prism stones were acting wonky

[3:48:49] <derap41> True the game lied
[3:48:49] <kenny_biff> ????
[3:48:50] <wandelmilch> Honestly, Reggies logic is absolutely reasonable
[3:48:50] <SarcFa> other message also said try ranged battle
[3:48:51] <Pie_Mastyr> gough is wise but not smart, reggie the boar is smart but not wise
[3:48:51] <susukouhai> those prism stones were baiting!
[3:48:52] <binocu__lars> the stone didn't scream!
[3:48:52] <klooswep> The prism stones lied, reggie died
[3:48:52] <TigerClaws12> to be fair it's not on him LUL
[3:48:54] <DSD24> Eyes on the inside
[3:48:55] <+warlockwithapixie> I see logic
[3:48:55] <derap41> The game did lie
[3:48:56] <+doomsdaydelilah> did reggie just not see the fog gate?
[3:48:56] <%gulthrax> Prism Stone: "SCREEEEEEEE!"
[3:49:00] <SarcFa> probably wasn't a jump here
[3:49:02] <%Ensign_Epic> and then Reggie triggered my Google Assistant somehow
[3:49:04] <%JetpackMcQuack> head's in the right spot
[3:49:05] <kenny_biff> @TigerClaws12 it's all on him
[3:49:05] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Those messages that say "Here!" are super confusing, I grant you. They're pointing out a spot from which you can cheese the boss by shooting him with a bow from outside the boss room.
[3:49:07] <+dekkitout> This is why we need 6 pairs of eyes
[3:49:09] <binocu__lars> reggie, fog gate fearer
[3:49:16] <TigerClaws12> he absolutely got got LUL
[3:49:16] <+Jiggisnipe> @doomsdaydelilah he fully explores before going through a fog gate
[3:49:17] <%dds333a> @doomsdaydelilah he was concerned with more pressing matters
[3:49:19] <+OneGorillionDollars> that one is absolutely not on reggie
[3:49:21] <%cubbywolf> it's not the first time reggie's jumped off a cliff and it won't be the last
[3:49:22] <+canseesea> @doomsdaydelilah I imagine the thought process was "Fog gate is progress, I want to see this weird side shit"
[3:49:34] <andre11dr> This is why Manus has like 15 eyes
[3:49:44] <+Malysitos> To be fair, the stones didn’t scream, and the game’s been fairly consistent with its rules. But now we see when the game breaks it’s own rules
[3:49:49] <%dds333a> @andre11dr he needs em LUL
[3:50:00] <klooswep> Reggie got got by a bug
[3:50:07] <+dekkitout> @andre11dr I bet he doesn't have lp blindness tajC
[3:50:10] <kenny_biff> you people saying it's not on him are whack, one little message and he does mental gymanistics
[3:50:18] <%Prevot> to be fair I'd say the stones SHOULD account for kill zones and scream when hitting them
[3:50:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> ow my ass
[3:50:24] <Johannen> @Malysitos We'seen prism stone lie in this playthrou, its not always consistent
[3:50:36] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[3:50:37] <Pie_Mastyr> if you remember the stones also successfully landed on some angled bs in blighttown that clearly was a pitfall
[3:50:38] <+NeonFishFace> try again, maybe it will work this time
[3:50:43] <%Ensign_Epic> yeah no that death was entirely on him, there was no reason to even think about jumping down there

[4:00:30] <atomizedstream> cuck artorias by petting his doggo
[4:00:30] <Jerp> thotbane there was one of them that people were saying came through phones or whatever. not sure the exact number - google search seems to think it might be one of a few

[4:00:32] <%Cozy90> That ain't falco

[4:01:13] <%BinaryFireball> no
[4:01:15] <ConflagrationsGaming> has he made it down to see manus or are we on the first run down
[4:01:16] <%BinaryFireball> manus is a giant hand

[4:01:26] <+SaltySeaSam> you gonna tell Reggie about the sif cutscene after this?
[4:01:26] <%hax_metatron> Sif is fantastic at distracting the boss. Anyone that thinks it’s a bad summon usually have  their summons do all the work for them
[4:01:27] <ConflagrationsGaming> JUST GOT HOME and sat down

[4:01:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> and it's gone
[4:01:43] <%A_German_spy> @thotbane It's never explicitly stated and it's ambiguous because of how Japanese handles gender pronouns. Some people assume female because the Norse god after whom Sif is named is female, but that's the only basis for the assumption

[4:04:42] <Arqartur0> woolieFUN
[4:04:42] <subjectg> There is a way without the pendant
[4:04:44] <%thotbane> @WoolieVersus THE PENDANT
[4:04:48] <%Tearonex> good effort Reggie!
[4:04:48] <+Breaknoon> Mudo
[4:04:49] <+Rafraud> IF ONLY
[4:04:49] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Great attempt! Just a bit of clarification for Reggie: Dark Bead needs to be cast at pointblank range to have any meaningful effect. You might be better off swapping that second cast of Soul Spear back in.
[4:04:50] <agustorm123> Thats was close
[4:04:51] <+Malysitos> He was close… he’s got this
[4:04:51] <+Awkward_Cyborg> sick dodges
[4:04:54] <%MrATheGreat> YES
[4:04:55] <NumbF4ke> changing dark beads to another set of spears should do the trick
[4:04:56] <+SilverDevilfish> limesDance MAGE crystaHype outmagics crystaHype Boar limesDance
[4:04:56] <+Jiggisnipe> he's got it
[4:04:57] <+Baldzinga> Wow, he figured it out
[4:04:57] <ChoculaUltra> if there's anything I learned from yesterday its always bet yes till Reggie wins Kappa
[4:04:58] <primaryfire> pat speculated that that long string with the slam at the end is probably what broke artorias' arm
[4:05:00] <%MajorCrasher> honestly don't even tell him about the pendant. using magic is already enough of a handicap LUL
[4:05:01] <crazy_riggs> Also get that DARK SPELLS away from a man with the word 'Abyss' in his name
[4:05:01] <nakunattakage> limesDance
[4:05:02] <%MooseIsGoose> take off stones
[4:05:03] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Tell reggie you can spam it
[4:05:03] <Uncle_Christian> Let Sif run her course
[4:05:03] <xxHungryxx> gonna farm points from these deaths. thx reggie
[4:05:03] <atomizedstream> pendant is cool
[4:05:05] <+Undenizen> idk is that "easier"?
[4:05:09] <+Shishi1205> no timing needed
[4:05:09] <Afrosamasenpai> op pendant time
[4:05:09] <%JetpackMcQuack> 2nd flask unlocked
[4:05:09] <+Awkward_Cyborg> time to attune other majicks
[4:05:10] <%dds333a> @breaknoon homie got hit with Mamudoon
[4:05:12] <Jerp> so the one that does an arc is dark bead. would the full circle that manus casts be called dark ring?
[4:05:13] <Reveresao> Take off gems
[4:05:15] <%Indigo_Automaton> Take off the crystals
[4:05:16] <+Baldzinga> @Undenizen Definitely easier
[4:05:17] <PunkZedB> emergencey prism stones op
[4:05:18] <%Ensign_Epic> Yeah, probably should take off the prism stones
[4:05:19] <%SirGO0SE> i havent voted once this whole playthrough, next one hes got it.
[4:05:19] <klooswep> Yeah, dark bead is very short range
[4:05:20] <Iwashi94> switch out that dark sorcery
[4:05:25] <JairusHopesItWorks> dark bead up close
[4:05:25] <pyjama_day> @dds333a mamudoBARION :P
[4:05:25] <Uncle_Christian> Manos :The Hands of Fate
[4:05:26] <+TopTieramisu> the game gives you a lot of tools to trivialize manus
[4:05:29] <+Grayhammatter> LETS GO
[4:05:30] <Arqartur0> woolieFUN
[4:05:31] <%Lion_kun> get rid of those pebbles
[4:05:32] <TigerClaws12> >taking off beads
[4:05:32] <legacy0117> Light shout that dark away.
[4:05:32] <Johannen> Manus didnt even used his Dark Rain on him
[4:05:43] <derap41> @Uncle_Christian The Gun is Good the Penis is bad
[4:05:44] <%MrATheGreat> human up
[4:05:46] <SarcFa> Reggie likes to distance too much for dark bead to be good
[4:05:47] <+BelricPsytar> Eat shit Reggie i got 10k on this
[4:05:48] <moonmintparadise> amazing he learned
[4:05:51] <+Breaknoon> no longer weak to Mamudoon
[4:05:53] <+HumanDoctor> don't choke
[4:05:55] <%BinaryFireball> you're robbing yourself reggie
[4:05:55] <youngking_kush> Manus hasn't used his big Fuck Off spell yet
[4:05:57] <%dds333a> rehumanize LUL
[4:05:57] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus tell Reggie to try and spam square with it
[4:05:58] <Uncle_Christian> lol
[4:05:59] <crazy_riggs> This could be it...
[4:06:02] <%Prevot> hhhmmmmmm
[4:06:03] <velgaduere> funny you say that
[4:06:07] <+Shishi1205> this one is unique
[4:06:08] <SarcFa> dark bead needs the face fuck
[4:06:08] <%Ensign_Epic> Sif makes the fight SIGNIFICANTLY better
[4:06:08] <%BinaryFireball> manus is one of the best fights in the game
[4:06:08] <moonmintparadise> tell him about the cutscene
[4:06:09] <pyjama_day> @Breaknoon we acquired dark block
[4:06:09] <%JetpackMcQuack> is solaire a dog
[4:06:11] <subjectg> hmm
[4:06:12] <Uncle_Christian> Summon Baby Rider
[4:06:13] <%SirGO0SE> damn vote closed to fast, was putting 140k on yes
[4:06:19] <velgaduere> I mean it did
[4:06:21] <andre11dr> I didn't vote cause i don't fuckin know at this point
[4:06:25] <+fatboysings1> TARKUS is best
[4:06:27] <subjectg> Magic is good man
[4:06:28] <%Prevot> it does normal damage without power within
[4:06:31] <Jewoodsforreal> fart
[4:06:32] <andre11dr> His doing a lot
[4:06:34] <Uncle_Christian> BLK IRON TARKUS
[4:06:39] <+SilverDevilfish> And Reggie isn't even getting extra damage from the pretty princess crown
[4:06:39] <+Breaknoon> @pyjama_day but that if the enemy has Pierce?
[4:06:40] <fat_burtreynolds> PoWaH WiThIn
[4:06:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> magic is big
[4:06:42] <youngking_kush> Magic is good man
[4:06:45] <andre11dr> Manus is resistant to magic too
[4:06:46] <subjectg> Iron Barkus was the best, i’m sad you guys didn’t give him a chance
[4:06:47] <%dds333a> yessir
[4:06:48] <glass_marcus> Sif Solaire and Tarkus are the trinity of darksouls summons
[4:06:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You didnt play with a high level sorcery before right?
[4:06:52] <%BisoromiBear> all that training at the library paid off
[4:06:53] <%dds333a> boy did he
[4:06:56] <%Ensign_Epic> I think Reggie's beating the game today, wow!
[4:06:56] <pyjama_day> @Breaknoon then...we doomed
[4:06:58] <Sestren413> Lets go strength mage!
[4:07:01] <%thotbane> high level sorcery gets STUPID
[4:07:02] <+Rafraud> DS1 Magic moment
[4:07:04] <+even_the_yuenglings> Im used to having a close up dog fight with him LuL
[4:07:07] <+RemedyofRevenge> honestly I would definitely recommend Reggie play this again on his own time if he wants to, but without sorceries
[4:07:07] <%A_German_spy> @Ensign_Epic There's definitely still time
[4:07:09] <%Lion_kun> do it outside the boss door
[4:07:09] <yukichocomilk> I kinda wanna see how reggie fares without magic in future games. he might get whooped
[4:07:10] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Crystal soul spear is like a 50 cal
[4:07:13] <andre11dr> All that Int pumping proved to be worth in the end
[4:07:13] <+Malysitos> Reggarth, the Muscle Mage
[4:07:14] <%Prevot> magic is even cool in DS3 despite being nerfed to fuck
[4:07:16] <+Breaknoon> @pyjama_day We gonna need Dante for this one
[4:07:18] <Wahrow> I believe in Reggie
[4:07:24] <+Grayhammatter> i believe
[4:07:29] <legacy0117> Wizards MAN
[4:07:39] <Uncle_Christian> Reggie the Lucky?
[4:07:45] <%Deasmeister> Does power within and dusk crown stack or are they just applied to base damage
[4:07:46] <TigerClaws12> AWAB
[4:07:47] <Wahrow> I put a lot of points on this Reggie!!
[4:07:47] <agustorm123> Range battle
[4:07:48] <%Ensign_Epic> @A_German_spy After that fight? I think Manus is dead before the top of the hour, if not half to
[4:07:49] <crazy_riggs> Will we see the combo?
[4:07:54] <+TopTieramisu> kinda wish woolie didn't remind him about the pendant LUL

[4:21:46] <%Prevot> my experience is she survives, but doesn't help at all
[4:21:50] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Manus going down for sure
[4:21:53] <%cubbywolf> sif survival strategies surely shoot straight

[4:22:32] <crazy_riggs> Reggie, going from 2 hits away from winning, to THIS
[4:22:32] <+canseesea> Manus going all chaos dunk on poor Reggarth
[4:22:33] <thelivingglitch307> does fat rolling have I frames?
[4:22:33] <%Lion_kun> Reggie, you could use your shield
[4:22:36] <%Javaa01> @Baldzinga Sif isn't taking all the aggro
[4:22:37] <%Prevot> it really is a repeat of artorias huh
[4:22:39] <Pie_Mastyr> reggie is bleeding the believers
[4:22:43] <%cubbywolf> swing LUL
[4:22:44] <+TopTieramisu> manus heard you talk shit
[4:22:44] <%Prevot> somehow reggie forgets how to play
[4:22:47] <Johannen> @Baldzinga unlocked and back turned trying to dodge is a bad idea
[4:22:48] <%Lion_kun> if you're not gonna use your shield, might as well two hand it lol
[4:22:51] <dundore77> can also go buy humanity from patches
[4:22:53] <%thedankestmeeme> wait isn't it lighter weight longer I frames?
[4:23:07] <+Jiggisnipe> @Baldzinga cuz overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer Kappa
[4:23:16] <%cubbywolf> damnit chat believe in reggie so I can take your  money!
[4:23:17] <+2Vibe2Check> Why not put on the health shield?
[4:23:24] <andre11dr> Gotta change it  you never know when he'll do it
[4:23:24] <Dopamien> @thedankestmeeme maybe? But you cover more distance

[4:23:41] <binocu__lars> he deals so much damage that the armor's not worth it
[4:23:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> mid roll is fine if you're good :)
[4:23:56] <TheProtomanBlues> @andre11dr Nah, I lost 40k trusting him yesterday lol
[4:23:57] <JdotSweapA> that shield isnt helping
[4:23:59] <Omenaire_> I wanna see Reggie do another playthrough with solely fast rolling
[4:23:59] <%Xaeveax> I think faster roll will help more here.
[4:24:04] <Dopamien> time to strip naked Kreygasm
[4:24:15] <subjectg> Personally fast roll or nothing
[4:24:24] <+even_the_yuenglings> fast roll for sure
[4:24:26] <andre11dr> I'll give him trust this one time
[4:24:27] <+TopTieramisu> this fight is so fun melee with rolls
[4:24:28] <%Irridium> fat roll kings
[4:24:30] <+Shishi1205> yeah ds1 fast rolling is the go to
[4:24:30] <+2Vibe2Check> I rely on I frames a lot
[4:24:31] <%cubbywolf> use the invulnerability of the roll
[4:24:36] <%Prevot> majority of my time with Souls has been fast roll no shield
[4:24:39] <+Shishi1205> still 100 equip load tho
[4:24:39] <%BinaryFireball> honestly I think the best thing he could do is forget all the previous fights
[4:24:45] <dundore77> yeah even if you have the fast roll timing is more important
[4:24:47] <%Lion_kun> Reggie could have won that one time if he remembered he had dark bead
[4:24:47] <%Xaeveax> @Prevot Same
[4:24:48] <+LeaIsChill> Tiny bit of scrub quotes but we good, it's Dark Souls
[4:24:49] <%cubbywolf> whoever slow rolls is crazy imo
[4:24:51] <Evilpuppys> time rolls xd
[4:24:52] <%Theycallmenerf> I remember I died to manus about 20 times with CHZwei, then I made a magic build for complete magic damage, did the Big Hat quest line and I nuked Manus on try 3.
[4:24:53] <%Catpurnicus> I glass-hammer fastrolled my way through this the first time, it was rough

[4:37:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's usually a toss up between Manus, Artorias and Kalameet, but it's usually those 3
[4:37:14] <%Theycallmenerf> Reggie bodied Dusk
[4:37:14] <%cubbywolf> LUL

[4:38:49] <%Ensign_Epic> @A_German_spy Yo, what's your take on the Manus soul here? The spell's amazing but with his build the catalyst would be pretty nuts

[4:39:08] <subjectg> @ensign_epic i think pursuers would be more his speed
[4:39:09] <%dds333a> badly

[4:41:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RemedyofRevenge lmao
[4:41:40] <%dds333a> They're quite nice
[4:41:42] <+2Vibe2Check> @LeaIsChill Gwyn forces NG+ unfortunately
[4:41:47] <+Mrbaconator> pursuers fucks
[4:41:48] <Pie_Mastyr> and they miss a lot less
[4:41:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> Both good options
[4:41:51] <ghilbor> It's a dank ass spell
[4:41:54] <BurdRightsActivist> BEST OPTION
[4:41:57] <klooswep> I've seen people argue that Velka was the furtive pygmy and... I just don't see it.
[4:41:59] <andre11dr> I think DS2 kinda confirms that he is the pygmie
[4:42:02] <foghornleghorn55> PVP spell
[4:42:04] <+SilverDevilfish> Gywn with only dark spells go
[4:42:12] <+LegacyOfTheSith> pursuer pvp monkaW

[4:42:33] <youngking_kush> What he was just whooping your ass with lol
[4:42:40] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus In case it got lost in chat going nuts over Reggie's victory: before you guys leave this zone, go to the center of the boss room and look at what's on the ground. You'll see something that will shed a bit of light.
[4:42:41] <Sestren413> spell spell spell spell
[4:42:47] <ghilbor> @andre11dr Ds3 kinda dismisses him being the pygmy though, so there are conflicting sources
[4:42:52] <subjectg> @a_german_spy they already saw dusk
[4:42:54] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:42:57] <%A_German_spy> @subjectg It's not Dusk
[4:42:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> now it's time to attack and dethrone GOD
[4:43:02] <%A_German_spy> @subjectg There's something else there
[4:43:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[4:43:12] <Johannen> !
[4:43:15] <%A_German_spy> @subjectg Yeah
[4:43:19] <velgaduere> *Bernie Sanders grumbling intensifies*
[4:43:31] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus There's a human-sized grave
[4:43:32] <%thotbane> oh yeah the upturned grave
[4:43:33] <Sestren413> beat gwyn with only dark spells and then finish with a black firebomb. perfection
[4:43:35] <+Shishi1205> a grave
[4:43:36] <%Ensign_Epic> Yeah Manus is likely the Pygmy, and a certain character from DS3 DLC was likely married off to him to secure an alliance between TRC & Anor Londo. Dusk is likely a descendant of his
[4:43:37] <velgaduere> oh look. a grave.
[4:43:38] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This right here, yes
[4:43:39] <+SilverDevilfish> a vagina

[4:43:55] <%MooseIsGoose> It was manus he was human sized
[4:43:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> no guys it's clearly a vagina
[4:43:57] <+LeaIsChill> The original Humanity?
[4:43:57] <foghornleghorn55> grave that was upturned
[4:43:58] <+Baldzinga> I had no idea there was a grave here
[4:43:58] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Elizabeth might have stuff
[4:43:59] <Afrosamasenpai> humanity grave
[4:44:00] <%FrostedZaibatsu> So easily forgotten
[4:44:00] <fat_burtreynolds> Stone Turd
[4:44:01] <%A_German_spy> @Ensign_Epic It's super easy to miss
[4:44:02] <Milfhunterextraodinaire> It also looks like a vagina. xD
[4:44:02] <%justcallmebobplease> Didn't Woolie know this, previously?
[4:44:03] <%Irridium> reggie just dancing on his grave
[4:44:06] <%Bread_Assassin> That is news to me. Thanks Spy.
[4:44:07] <leomuratore> It looks like his soul in the inventory, right?
[4:44:08] <blackskulldragon18> Poor Shadoe
[4:44:10] <velgaduere> oh god it does look like... no wonder the Abyss was BIRTHED here
[4:44:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> That's the 'Byssy
[4:44:15] <+Evilgeniuz78> Elizabeth has some lore
[4:44:16] <%RemedyofRevenge> RemedyofRevenge subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Thanks for the streams, your excitement for games is infectious and a part of why I love FGs. Thanks and play Pathologic 2 sometime if you can :)
[4:44:16] <%Rasheedt> @milfhunterextraodinaire thesph1BabyFUwatch
[4:44:17] <derap41> Don't wake up daddy when he's napping
[4:44:19] <ghilbor> My mans was just sitting in his grave
[4:44:20] <%Irridium> the Dark Sussy
[4:44:21] <youngking_kush> An empty grave encircled
[4:44:24] <%A_German_spy> @Bread_Assassin No worries. Most people are so focused on the fight that they miss it, which is understandable.
[4:44:25] <%Prevot> Kaathe was like "hey come disturb this grave lmao"
[4:44:26] <andre11dr> Reggie gonna Pursuers and Dark Beed and kill Gwyn in one shot
[4:44:27] <+TheFrancix> so humanity is the shape of manus?
[4:44:28] <BurdRightsActivist> The blood
[4:44:36] <%dds333a> very few things will ever have concrete answers LUL
[4:44:37] <OkamiDude15> the furtive pygmy so easily forgotten
[4:44:41] <agsiar2> GWYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYN
[4:44:44] <%thotbane> @A_German_spy do YOU think Manus is the Pygmy?
[4:44:54] <%Grimlockfly> I feel the ringed city locks it I. Alright
[4:45:07] <MinersLoveGames> I choose to believe that Manus is the pygmy. A lot of things in the game point to that being the case. But everyone has their own interpretation.
[4:45:10] <+dekkitout> The Ur Guy
[4:45:14] <subjectg> Manus, the Hand of Fate
[4:45:15] <youngking_kush> I think Ringed City hard confirms Manus as NOT the pygmy
[4:45:18] <+Sir_Louis> manus and the hands of fw
[4:45:21] <dundore77> Mannus is also the german father of humankind
[4:45:22] <LunarRemix> DS3 kind of shits all over the concept of pygmies
[4:45:22] <BurdRightsActivist> S means Strand
[4:45:23] <%BisoromiBear> The Hand of Fate is Grabbing
[4:45:25] <fat_burtreynolds> Idk Manus looks like a goddamn Bloodbourne boss
[4:45:30] <%FrostedZaibatsu> So they just too all those definitions and made a boss
[4:45:31] <ghilbor> If you have good strength the manus catalyst will boost dark sorceries, since they deal part physical damage
[4:45:33] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:45:37] <%A_German_spy> @TheFrancix It's more like Manus was originally a regular human, so his grave is shaped accordingly
[4:45:37] <youngking_kush> His soul says he was Human, and RC shows Pygmy Lords were a thing
[4:45:37] <Uncle_Christian> ✋🤚
[4:45:41] <AbnormalVoid> SAN.D
[4:45:42] <%Ensign_Epic> @LunarRemix Nah, TRC actually really expands upon this lore here
[4:45:47] <BurdRightsActivist> @fat_burtreynolds Cleric Beast literally has the same arm.

[4:45:52] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Manus Catalyst also gives spell power from STR so would work with Reggie's build
[4:45:53] <ghilbor> Deepest lore
[4:45:54] <%dds333a> @frostedzaibatsu it's symbolism
[4:45:56] <KellBeII> its the best catalyst in the game for dark sorceries and your specific build
[4:45:56] <%BisoromiBear> snuggly getting turnt
[4:45:57] <%MooseIsGoose> Bird up

[4:46:07] <%hax_metatron> DS1 Pygmy lore >>>>>>>> Ringed City Pygmy lore IMO
[4:46:08] <subjectg> Snuggly is the furtive pygmy
[4:46:09] <TheProtomanBlues> Finish her
[4:46:10] <Uncle_Christian> Because I can
[4:46:11] <Enn19> Tiny Crow TAKE THIS CURRUPTED HUMANITY SOUL
[4:46:11] <%kewlmyc> In the future doesn't she drown?
[4:46:11] <%A_German_spy> @thotbane There's a strong possibility of that, yes. Chester refers to him as "primeval man," which means "the originator of man"
[4:46:12] <klooswep> Talk to Dusk again in darkroot basin

[4:46:28] <%A_German_spy> @TheFrancix Sure thing.
[4:46:29] <MinersLoveGames> Give the souls of one of the MOST POWERFUL being in the Dark Souls universe and give it to this kleptomaniac-ass crow!
[4:46:40] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus make sure to show Reggie the alt sif fight cutscene since he already fought him
[4:46:42] <ghilbor> so does Snuggly eat the soul and shit out the spell?

[4:53:47] <foghornleghorn55> I really hope Reggie choses hexes if he does ds2. coolest build by far
[4:53:57] <subjectg> @woolieversus if you’re going to go to firelink altar, remember to warp there via kaathe for a little more dialog
[4:53:57] <BigYanno> Did he actually try dark bead or did he just think he did?
[4:53:58] <velgaduere> we gonna take that Estus to +5 before the end?
[4:54:05] <%quintonomo> i love that spell,
[4:54:06] <+Shishi1205> @BigYanno he did try
[4:54:13] <Johannen> @velgaduere Killing the Brass lady?
[4:54:13] <%quintonomo> reggie MIGHT one shot Gwyn with that spell
[4:54:18] <velgaduere> @Johannen yeye
[4:54:18] <%thotbane> @foghornleghorn55 im still confused by what hexes are. arent they just certain specific miracles and spells
[4:54:31] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:54:32] <%quintonomo> it is funny that Gwyn will most likely be a massive push over when Reggie gets there, lol
[4:54:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dark bead is easily the strongest spell in the game
[4:54:36] <codydudetm> Pursuers plus Tin catalyst??
[4:54:37] <Johannen> I dont think they want to and not realy needed to boost his Estus
[4:54:38] <Sestren413> How much is a levelup for him now? How hard would it be to get enough atunement for another spell before the end?
[4:54:41] <SarcFa> @BigYanno He did, he just shot it from afar cause he likes to range it out instead of face scrape

[5:02:24] <emptyantics> :(
[5:02:25] <agsiar2> I don't blame you for killing Sif, Reggie. I blame you for killing Priscilla, though.
[5:02:28] <%justcallmebobplease> @A_German_Spy do you get to keep the Abyss ring in NG+ so you can skip fighting Sif entirely on further runs?
[5:02:32] <Bedllama> @alphonseisbest Sif used to be a fairly common woman's name in Scandinavia.
[5:02:33] <SpookyMooks> its pretty nuts
[5:02:33] <BurdRightsActivist> @paladinstarbuster You have to if you need to defeat the four kings.
[5:02:36] <%A_German_spy> @justcallmebobplease No, sadly.
[5:02:44] <@Solidus_113> without cheating
[5:02:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @a_german_spy BRUH WHAT I NEVER REALIZED
[5:02:48] <subjectg> @justcallmebobplease nah bitch, gotta bork that pupper again
[5:02:48] <BigYanno> the only way to do that is to be a total badass and beat the DLC early
[5:02:49] <+Shishi1205> In Norse mythology, Sif is the golden-haired wife of the god Thor
[5:02:49] <+alphonseisbest> @velgaduere i'm wondering if this is Fan lore, if it got confirmed in game some where that I missed, nothing ill meaning towards it
[5:02:54] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus Sif can't let you take the ring, lest you fall to the same fate that Artorias did. A fight of friends for your own good
[5:02:59] <%justcallmebobplease> @A_German_spy Awwww, so there's no reality where you progress and Sif lives... yeah that's thematically appropriate.
[5:03:01] <+Grayhammatter> it super is
[5:03:04] <ghilbor> cheating for this is worth it
[5:03:14] <Johannen> Dark Souls is Tragic, attempting to "save" anyone is futile and goes against the nature of the game
[5:03:14] <AllenDeadman> your reward is PAIN
[5:03:15] <%A_German_spy> @justcallmebobplease However, before Fromsoft uncharitably nerfed the Bottomless Box glitch, it WAS possible to carry over your entire box contents onto a new character, including the Covenant of Artorias, so you COULD skip Sif and never have to kill them.
[5:03:16] <%MrATheGreat> @paladinstarbuster Which you need to get the Lord Vessel to beat thr game
[5:03:27] <shieldanvil> congrats for sequence breaking. enjoy the feels

[5:03:32] <%A_German_spy> @abelincoln_catpuncher What, about the alternate cutscene?
[5:03:36] <Arqartur0> o7
[5:03:45] <%RemedyofRevenge> completely changes the context from grave robbing to trying to stop a friend from making a mistake that Arty had\
[5:03:47] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> @agsiar2 idk, Priscilla is a liar. She said the inhabitants of the painted world are peaceful but there’s is nothing there than doesn’t want to absolutely murder you
[5:03:48] <+Mrbaconator> @A_German_spy if you wear the calamity ring and get grabbed by kalameet do the debuffs stack
[5:03:50] <SarcFa> @ghilbor not really on a first run, it hits harder if you see the scene after doing it normal imho
[5:03:54] <%tigerfang86> manus BLASTED HIS ARM

[5:04:40] <KellBeII> @thotbane That theory comes from DS2 and makes no sense
[5:04:43] <@Solidus_113> Another hour to finish?
[5:04:44] <BigYanno> I wonder if the item randomizer randomizes the covenant
[5:04:44] <youngking_kush> Would be the Coliseum
[5:04:47] <+canseesea> He gave his shield to Sif and ended up getting his arm all fucked without a shield
[5:04:56] <@Solidus_113> or save and do 2 games next week
[5:04:56] <VincentGraves> has Reggie beaten the 2 chimeras?
[5:04:59] <+extradopeness> i just wanna hear the nameless song
[5:04:59] <%A_German_spy> @Solidus_113 This can TOTALLY happen in one hour.
[5:05:00] <%kewlmyc> Just watch the cutscene after this
[5:05:02] <%thotbane> @thotbane yeah but its anime as fuck
[5:05:04] <subjectg> @bigyanno if you let it randomize plot progression items sure it can
[5:05:05] <SpookyMooks> was there more dlc after this?
[5:05:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Best game of the 10's
[5:05:10] <%superc37> @thotbane that bit of fanfic doesn't get invented until ds2, so no
[5:05:11] <zhenthrim213> @BigYanno you can set it to do tht
[5:05:12] <Arqartur0> @VincentGraves yes
[5:05:15] <youngking_kush> Arty's grave is where the Coliseum was in the past pretty sure
[5:05:16] <%dds333a> he sees it

[5:05:25] <atomizedstream> @woolieversus the wonder is that no words are needed for this story
[5:05:28] <%Prevot> an hour? lol he only needs 20 min to beat the game now
[5:05:35] <+extradopeness> @spookymooks seems all thats left is the guardians
[5:05:35] <%A_German_spy> @Ensign_Epic No doubt about that whatsoever.
[5:05:41] <ghilbor> gwyn is tricky for some pelopl

[5:05:57] <Pie_Mastyr> in the original lp, you spawned the ring in
[5:05:59] <+swesterly> choosing kaathe after being friends with sif is kind of a huge betrayal though
[5:06:00] <%A_German_spy> @velgaduere We already did. Woolie "guided" Reggie in there earlier.
[5:06:00] <%Pillagius> somebody just gave you the ring
[5:06:01] <+Geronimo9037> you cheated
[5:06:01] <%thotbane> @WoolieVersus Pat cheated so you got both

[5:06:09] <%dds333a> @quintonomo based choice. also fire keeper ending is best
[5:06:09] <+king_of_mystery2> You cheated teh ring in
[5:06:11] <youngking_kush> @subjectg Is it? you dont cross the bridge to get to the Sanctuary tho
[5:06:11] <%Ensign_Epic> @A_German_spy Honestly the run-up is gonna be the trickiest part, but he knows how to handle Black Knights
[5:06:12] <velgaduere> @A_German_spy right, but he didn't defeat them, did he?
[5:06:12] <%tigerfang86> Pat with the POWER CHEATS
[5:06:13] <GeoGio3> someone gave you the ring, plague I think
[5:06:16] <%superc37> no he didnt chat, you fucking idiots
[5:06:17] <+sewermonk> did Woolie end up mentioning the left handed Artorias thing last session as well?
[5:06:19] <KellBeII> Think Eli said he just gave you guys the ring or something

[5:06:38] <%A_German_spy> @velgaduere Nah, but you get nothing from doing so, and they have JUST enough time to wrap this up tonight if they go straight to Gwyn.
[5:06:40] <%superc37> woolie saw the cutscene and pat showed him a yt video of frampt afterwards morons
[5:06:44] <+sewermonk> gotcha, I missed half of last session

[5:08:30] <foghornleghorn55> Ornstein is captain so I think he's canonically stronger
[5:08:30] <velgaduere> NOT EVEN FULL STRENGTH
[5:08:31] <+Grayhammatter> Boartorias
[5:08:31] <%hax_metatron> SO SICK
[5:08:33] <%tigerfang86> that's legit fashion
[5:08:34] <Aussie_Manny> it's the tattered scarf that makes it
[5:08:35] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> i really wish we got to meer the real Artorias
[5:08:36] <AbnormalVoid> Hogtorias
[5:08:36] <+Bitscreed> It's growing on me
[5:08:37] <Omenaire_> artorias is the protagonist
[5:08:38] <%Ensign_Epic> OH SHIT THIS FASHION EVEN BETTER
[5:08:38] <subjectg> Artorias + havel’s looks pretty good
[5:08:38] <@Solidus_113> BOARTORIAS
[5:08:40] <Jerp> has Reggie fought all of the bosses in the DLC? I think I missed one
[5:08:40] <Gurulinx> BECOME AS GODS. like Artorias.
[5:08:41] <%hax_metatron> THROWING MY PANTIES AT THE SCREEN RN
[5:08:41] <dundore77> but your the hero
[5:08:42] <crazy_riggs> @mr_sups A bit of trouble with Kalameet, but not to much. Manus gave him a rougher time. Going from nearly beating on try two, to just BARELY winning on the 9th time
[5:08:43] <%Deasmeister> Lighter roll for Artorias
[5:08:46] <Afrosamasenpai> The yellow skirt was better
[5:08:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dark bead can 2 shot them
[5:08:47] <klooswep> An entire shonen anime happened before you showed up
[5:08:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BOARTORIAS
[5:08:49] <ChoculaUltra> Alvina being the last of the trio left to tell the tale always bummed me out FeelsBadMan
[5:08:49] <+theoldone001> John DarkSouls
[5:08:49] <+Bitscreed> He WAS the hero Reggie. Now YOU are.
[5:08:53] <+TheMilkiestShake> @foghornleghorn55 Strongest doesn't mean best leader though
[5:08:54] <+Grayhammatter> yo, that actually looks sick
[5:08:54] <+extradopeness> so theyre finally here PERFORMING FOR YOU
[5:08:55] <%dds333a> @agsiar2 I can't believe he forgot despite literally talking about weeks before LUL
[5:08:57] <Aussie_Manny> Young Midoriya, you too can become a hero.

[5:09:04] <%MechArch> fashion time
[5:09:05] <BigYanno> I still don't like the gloves
[5:09:05] <%paladinstarbuster> Art could have done it if he had his shield
[5:09:09] <+vaderxyz1970> He's not a tree though
[5:09:09] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> This is why you shouldn't meet your heroes
[5:09:16] <Aussie_Manny> Reggarth Arboarias.

[5:09:20] <Omenaire_> my favorite part is gwynevere :)
[5:09:21] <+A_Casual_Scrub> no  thats ds3
[5:09:21] <+Rafraud> Artorias did MOST of Reggies work
[5:09:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's cooler tho
[5:09:26] <TheProtomanBlues> That reminded me when Reggie yelled "IM A HERO"
[5:09:27] <crazy_riggs> An Aurori boriatus? At this time of day, at this time of the year, localized entirely within Anor Londo?
[5:09:28] <+Evilgeniuz78> This man really rocked the boar helm the whole game doodGood
[5:09:29] <MinersLoveGames> That actually looks pretty sick.

[5:09:40] <youngking_kush> Art could've done it if he had the Pendant
[5:09:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Dragoon helmet is always sick
[5:09:42] <+vaderxyz1970> @hraezlyrnoyaiba Because they might be infected by the darkness of primeval man?
[5:09:43] <%MrATheGreat> unless you want to finish the very exciting Griggs storyline Kappa

[5:11:07] <%dds333a> LUL
[5:11:10] <Aussie_Manny> Pocket Souls.
[5:11:12] <+extradopeness> hes the first member of the DS crew

[5:11:25] <%dds333a> it's smooth sailing from here, as is always the case
[5:11:30] <Jathspuh> don't forget the 2 sanctuary guardians if you didn't get them
[5:11:33] <BigYanno> one brave
[5:11:41] <BigYanno> large brave*
[5:11:41] <%A_German_spy> @Jathspuh Woolie just reminded him. He knows.
[5:11:43] <+Evilgeniuz78> Chester has the best outfit
[5:11:51] <%dds333a> Every time somebody fights the superboss before the intended final boss LUL

[5:12:15] <%MrATheGreat> I mean you COULDc add the sword to that
[5:12:19] <+Bitscreed> Don't forget Artorias' shield for extra cosplay points
[5:12:20] <%bevyrage> wait not half an hour, like ten minutes
[5:12:21] <youngking_kush> FULL COSPLAY
[5:12:26] <@Solidus_113> doing his name dirty by being a mage though

[5:12:41] <foghornleghorn55> thicc
[5:12:42] <+Shishi1205> Is the shield you get from sif's soul different from that one?
[5:12:42] <dundore77> the legs really ruin it for me
[5:12:42] <+Grayhammatter> but ArtBoarias
[5:12:43] <ds3namecaldara> ^
[5:12:43] <%RemedyofRevenge> those ankles are mighty thin tho
[5:12:46] <%Demoli_PT> the hel gotta go tho
[5:12:48] <KellBeII> ack, the ankles are so bad
[5:12:48] <BigYanno> I really don't like his chicken legs
[5:12:58] <%thotbane> use SIlver Knight pants for better look
[5:12:59] <%dds333a> @solidus_113 would Artorias be against filthy magic users LUL
[5:12:59] <+doomsdaydelilah> just have to swap the hands
[5:13:02] <SarcFa> @superc37 @superc37 in the original LP Woolie killed Four Kings in Episode 51, and killed Sif in Episode 69, not possible unless they spawned in the ring, still looking for the exact episode and moment it was mentioned
[5:13:09] <+Malysitos> Artorias really needs to add leg days to his workout
[5:13:12] <LVL1_Scumbag> Shit's heavy
[5:13:17] <subjectg> Cosplaying other people feels bad to me though, why make a character if you’re just gonna wear someone else’s gear?
[5:13:20] <+Undenizen> Artorias is left handed.
[5:13:25] <Gurulinx> Big heavy boi
[5:13:29] <%MrATheGreat> SHIELD GRIND?!
[5:13:34] <Aussie_Manny> daaaamn boy he thicc
[5:13:36] <GeoGio3> yeh
[5:13:36] <youngking_kush> @sarcfa They cheated the Covenant of Artorias in the original LO
[5:13:37] <%RemedyofRevenge> The crest shield is, yes
[5:13:38] <%dds333a> the different edition
[5:13:40] <youngking_kush> LP*
[5:13:43] <KellBeII> @Undenizen He is not, that is a DS2 statement that makes no sense
[5:13:44] <BigYanno> Which box art?
[5:13:45] <%superc37> @sarcfa just checked it too, my mistake.
[5:13:47] <crazy_riggs> Pling Pling Plong just there, and they see Artorius roll us? Dude's got to be SO confused XD
[5:13:49] <ChoculaUltra> always wanted a dlc fight against all 4 knights of gwyn at the same time somehow FeelsBadMan
[5:13:52] <Pie_Mastyr> isnt it the non corrupted version?
[5:13:55] <derap41> ut might be
[5:13:55] <JoshWithASpoon> I think it was on Prepare to Die?
[5:14:01] <emptyantics> It is
[5:14:06] <youngking_kush> It's the Non-Corrupted version tho
[5:14:06] <%superc37> @undenizen not in ds1.
[5:14:13] <subjectg> John Artorias himself
[5:14:17] <%cubbywolf> cool guy alert
[5:14:19] <%tigerfang86> the CREW
[5:14:23] <%tigerfang86> imagine the COOL GUY CREW
[5:14:25] <%Catpurnicus> Abyss walk with me
[5:14:26] <velgaduere> well no one can compare to the main protagonist, Reggie
[5:14:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you get the real one from Sifs soul
[5:14:32] <BigYanno> iirc the non corrupted version needs sif's soul
[5:14:32] <%dds333a> @subjectg I love it myself, just for style LUL
[5:14:35] <%cubbywolf> clearly
[5:14:38] <%Pillagius> you're holding the shield with wrong arm tho
[5:14:40] <sirrice77> I mean idk why you say that when you beat the abyss which they could not so
[5:14:42] <+Bitscreed> Imagine how baller the original Knights of Gwynn must've looked riding together.
[5:14:45] <andre11dr> People relate to Gwyn are usually badasses
[5:15:02] <%dds333a> hell yeah they are
[5:15:03] <dundore77> i mean theres nothing that says thats how artorias actually fights and wasn't the abyss/manus controlling artorias
[5:15:05] <Gurulinx> If you can’t save the main character, gotta steal their drip I guess Keepo
[5:15:06] <+canseesea> Artorias getting credit for his friends work is the most protagonist thing about him
[5:15:17] <+Grayhammatter> the parachute pants
[5:15:17] <%superc37> @pillagius no hes not, reggie just doesnt have the stat requirements to use it. you cannot block with shields in the right hand in ds1.
[5:15:18] <+Evilgeniuz78> 🍄 time

[5:15:55] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:15:56] <ChoculaUltra> iirc, you need to get at least one sin to even plat the game on PS3
[5:15:57] <subjectg> can you kill rickert?
[5:16:00] <%nickdooody> lol
[5:16:01] <%bevyrage> Both artorias' shield and sword have unlocked movesets when you have their stat requirements.

[5:27:32] <+0neReeler> giants are working with micro tools

[5:27:33] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The new dialogue here is the introductory and parting lines.
[5:27:34] <emptyantics> H E L L O
[5:27:36] <youngking_kush> "Farewell, Proud Human"

[5:28:30] <subjectg> Duskface was banned in Lordran after a prolonged Catarinan rights movement
[5:28:34] <+Bitscreed> "You wanna come into the gaze-" "NO!"
[5:28:38] <BigYanno> wanna fight a luchadore in a closet? That's the gough fight
[5:28:39] <fat_burtreynolds> Kill hydra?

[5:28:41] <%zanz_san> BATTLE GAZEBO
[5:28:41] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Gough does wrestling moves on you and Andre went to boxing school lol

[5:29:15] <%Ensign_Epic> Andre's dropkick is fuckin nuts
[5:29:20] <+Evilgeniuz78> Box Andre
[5:29:22] <subjectg> Andre’s got a dropkick that’s super rad
[5:29:30] <ds3namecaldara> nah bro, he's good
[5:29:31] <+Shishi1205> ye
[5:29:37] <%SaintBeau> yeah
[5:29:38] <%HeroToxiko> yes
[5:29:39] <%dds333a> Quite
[5:29:42] <+Shishi1205> theres art about it
[5:29:42] <BurdRightsActivist> Yeah, it's cut content. He was supposed to be gwyn's son
[5:29:42] <+Finnmac5> yes
[5:29:42] <+Undenizen> I think he used to be the nameless son?
[5:29:43] <+king_of_mystery2> Has his own animations
[5:29:43] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's correct
[5:29:43] <subjectg> He used to be pretty important but it got cut
[5:29:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah Andre was supposed to be Gywns disgraced son
[5:29:50] <ds3namecaldara> he was but not anymore which is why he has moving lips
[5:29:50] <+Bitscreed> He'd open the way to the final area iirc
[5:29:50] <%MrATheGreat> he used to be th emissing son iirc
[5:29:53] <%SaintBeau> he used to be the character that opened the way to the First Kiln
[5:29:54] <+king_of_mystery2> He can dropkick you.
[5:29:54] <DeathByPoke7> Andre was the firstborn right?
[5:29:56] <andre11dr> Andre boxes your face off if you fuck with him
[5:29:59] <%thotbane> @abelincoln_catpuncher ....was he the firstborn?
[5:30:07] <BigYanno> I'm happy they changed things though so we could get Nameless King
[5:30:07] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus He was originally supposed to be a descendant of Lord Gwyn, and when you talked to him, he would move the statue behind where Frampt appears, revealing a path down to Firelink Altar
[5:30:14] <+TungstenViper> he was supposed to be the "nameless"
[5:30:15] <ds3namecaldara> one of the first models made
[5:30:16] <+Undenizen> @thotbane he was GOING to be but they cut that, so it's not canon
[5:30:17] <+Grayhammatter> andre can dropkick you into next week
[5:30:25] <KyberNasse> SUPER BATTLE GAZEBO
[5:30:28] <youngking_kush> @a_german_spy Beat me to it lol
[5:30:28] <fat_burtreynolds> Andre knows that southern star waterfowl technique after all
[5:30:30] <Uncle_Christian> its a good thing
[5:30:30] <%dds333a> without bosses LUL
[5:30:34] <+Malysitos> They are many things that do support Andre’s importance as a character, such as one of few with actual moving lips
[5:30:35] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @thotbane based on the cut content yeah but it didn't happen and we got a cool boss anyways
[5:30:36] <%DashXero> Apex
[5:30:37] <Aydarkzero> for sport
[5:30:39] <BigYanno> There is one ETERNAL threat in Dark Souls. GRAVITY!

[5:30:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah why is Andre the only one with working lips lnao

[5:34:15] <Awesome_Leaf> sexy boar artorias
[5:34:17] <velgaduere> this is how the legend of Artorias truly came to be
[5:34:23] <%Irridium> that boar helmet looks familiar... could it be? Nah it could've been anyone
[5:34:24] <slackerunchained> Too horizontal to see straight...
[5:34:25] <klooswep> She saw you, but she thought you were artorias
[5:34:25] <ChoculaUltra> Alvina KNOWS
[5:34:26] <%MrATheGreat> She remembered a dude and his doggo
[5:34:32] <mikesapartment> artorias in the big pig helm
[5:34:33] <Tempmael> some badass with a wolf saved her Kappa
[5:34:34] <dundore77> you look so similar
[5:34:35] <ghilbor> Boartorias saved her
[5:34:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> A familiar scent of pork
[5:34:36] <Arqartur0> Boar-Helmed Artorias, yeah
[5:34:36] <%Prevot> surely it was a wolf and not a boar
[5:34:38] <%SaintBeau> artorias was wearing this weird Pig helmet
[5:34:38] <%dds333a> eh, can't be Kappa
[5:34:39] <Awesome_Leaf> does alvina get new dialog?
[5:34:40] <ds3namecaldara> This confirming Summons can literally be a person you talk to but they never really do it again
[5:34:42] <+Bitscreed> "Artorias wore a pig helmet, right?"
[5:34:45] <BigYanno> I'm pretty sure Alvina knows everything
[5:34:46] <LunarRemix> She does not @Awesome_Leaf
[5:34:47] <%Irridium> Artorias and his big boar helm
[5:34:48] <dexdestroyazz> Boartorias
[5:34:48] <Awesome_Leaf> thats a shame
[5:34:49] <+Shishi1205> dont think so

[5:34:54] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You're correct, sadly.

[5:35:07] <deeriojim> Ciaran likely knew as well, but whatever happened to her we dont know
[5:35:12] <BurdRightsActivist> You're not artorias. >Yes, >No

[5:36:04] <LVL1_Scumbag> From makes some cool shit
[5:36:05] <glass_marcus> This is the franchise maker
[5:36:05] <emptyantics> It was a journey :(
[5:36:05] <+Krasmeyts> So Woolie's Dark Soul journey started (uploaded) on Christmas, right? This is somewhat poetic.
[5:36:07] <nakunattakage> yeah it's so much better than demons souls nakunaKek
[5:36:10] <xerotwo> Until DS 2 Kappa
[5:36:12] <%thotbane> There is a reason this is one of the greatest games of all time
[5:36:13] <%SaintBeau> it's monolithic

[5:36:13] <andre11dr> Well, it's down from here LUL

[5:36:21] <Zayasu> it gets better with every game Kappa
[5:36:21] <Pie_Mastyr> demon's souls I like more aesthetically, but dark souls feels like whole package
[5:36:22] <deeriojim> the reason we are praising the sun
[5:36:23] <Dio_TR> GAME OF THE GENERATION
[5:36:24] <%MrATheGreat> Because of the dlc?
[5:36:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Could Bluepoint remaster this and not fuck it up?

[5:36:26] <28moogles> I like DS2 and Bloodborne more, but this was good too.
[5:36:27] <%BinaryFireball> Bloodborne next?
[5:36:28] <+even_the_yuenglings> imagine ds1 with the demon's souls treatment Kreygasm
[5:36:30] <+Jiggisnipe> Also alot people also didn't play DeS so DS1 was their 1st
[5:36:31] <@Solidus_113> actually a game of the generation
[5:36:33] <+Double_Tap_That> The Dark Souls of Souls games
[5:36:34] <Aussie_Manny> Dark Souls is the most Dark Souls I've ever Dark Souls'd.
[5:36:36] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Oh, you've a ways to go yet, young Reggarth spyCappa

[5:40:45] <%thotbane> I choose to believe that the Warriors of Sunlight are a knightly order, and Solaire's like, their janitor or the stableboy. And he just stole/handmade some stuff and is a bootleg knight

[5:42:44] <+Grayhammatter> they got COOKED
[5:42:47] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> black knights mokyNODDERS
[5:42:48] <%thotbane> Why didn't Gwyn have his knights evacuate the area?
[5:42:49] <AllenDeadman> Charred
[5:42:50] <Dio_TR> BELIEVE IT
[5:42:53] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> everything is clearly blasted
[5:42:55] <captain_kirkhammer> I thought the black knights got burnt by demons
[5:42:55] <deeriojim> hardened by the flame
[5:42:56] <%SaintBeau> the fire used to be MASSIVE
[5:42:56] <Pie_Mastyr> I love how its not outwardly burning, but spiralling around the centre
[5:42:57] <+Jiggisnipe> I thought the Black Knight was from the Bed of Chaos incident?
[5:42:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> 1 hour at 400F
[5:43:00] <%dds333a> they got their souls SEARED away
[5:43:02] <Equirah> @thotbane to feed the fire
[5:43:03] <%thotbane> NOPE their armor got  burnt fighting the Demons
[5:43:05] <BurdRightsActivist> BK-Pass
[5:43:09] <velgaduere> @thotbane what happened was not foreseen
[5:43:13] <oglogyy> their weapons are also different but nevermind that LUL
[5:43:14] <shieldanvil> FeelsBadMan
[5:43:15] <+John_Oki> crazy cool environment,
[5:43:17] <ChoculaUltra> "oh sick armor bro, you customize it yourself?" "yeah, just stood a little too close to that kiln, man."
[5:43:19] <KellBeII> GGs reggiecide
[5:43:20] <%justcallmebobplease> It's a pity you don't see un-burnt demon-hunting Silver Knights, just to see them with their big huge weapons.
[5:43:22] <Aussie_Manny> Dang.
[5:43:25] <+alphonseisbest> Half got burnt here
[5:43:25] <ghilbor> until they return to the world
[5:43:25] <%superc37> @thotbane bold of you to assume gwyn cares about anyone or thing other than his own power
[5:43:29] <+Grayhammatter> something, or someone
[5:43:30] <slackerunchained> Unlike Humans, Gwyns knights dont come back to Bonfires...
[5:43:30] <@Solidus_113> the final homies
[5:43:31] <%justcallmebobplease> Or, I guess that one in DS3 counts, maybe?
[5:43:33] <+alphonseisbest> half got burnt fighting deamons
[5:43:37] <%SaintBeau> the fire was so much bigger than it is now
[5:43:39] <%vivaciouseff> iirc the ones on the stairs are the knights YOU’ve killed
[5:43:41] <deeriojim> @oglogyy their weapons were given to them in the demon wars, IIRC it was before they were burned
[5:43:43] <+pectusumbra> that's more or less correct
[5:43:45] <%kewlmyc> Burnt armor
[5:43:50] <Equirah> @vivaciouseff nah
[5:43:51] <%JetpackMcQuack> nice silver armor dude
[5:43:52] <subjectg> @oglogyy those weapons are what they used to fight demons, their armor was charred black by demons, their souls were burned by the first flame
[5:43:55] <b_ikki> correct enough
[5:44:01] <%SaintBeau> try parrying
[5:44:03] <%tigerfang86> BLAM
[5:44:04] <henchmanshuffle> moonlight greatsword?
[5:44:05] <fat_burtreynolds> 9 inch difference
[5:44:05] <%SaintBeau> yessir
[5:44:07] <%dds333a> These Knights are OG, they chose to stay
[5:44:07] <%thotbane> @superc37 Eh, I believe he wanted a brighter future for Gods (like, his race of 8+ foot tall people), just not humans
[5:44:07] <%MajorCrasher> if he does on the way to the boss it counts LUL
[5:44:08] <%nickdooody> LUL
[5:44:09] <ChoculaUltra> yesssss
[5:44:09] <oglogyy> I see, forgot about that
[5:44:11] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:44:14] <Aussie_Manny> right up the butt!
[5:44:14] <+TheIndigoLlama> Silver Knights are the babe in the woods of this game's story LUL
[5:44:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> big chunky rocks
[5:44:14] <slackerunchained> Knight: "GOD I wish I could just retire..."
[5:44:16] <ChoculaUltra> circle around and stab'em in the back
[5:44:17] <BurdRightsActivist> haha, ONE
[5:44:17] <%MajorCrasher> dies*
[5:44:18] <+Shishi1205> farmable knights
[5:44:19] <+Bitscreed> Who needs parries when you have backstabs?
[5:44:22] <+extradopeness> they aint seen nothin like reggarth
[5:44:23] <%SaintBeau> woolie tell him about the size of the fire
[5:44:28] <Dio_TR> THIRD STRIKE TIME
[5:44:29] <Aussie_Manny> right up the ash!
[5:44:30] <agsiar2> i still don't get the whole "anor londo was just an illusion" thing... like, all the silver knights and white demons were never there?
[5:44:35] <%SaintBeau> why everything is burnt and melted
[5:44:36] <AllenDeadman> it's a brick
[5:44:38] <KaiserMario> Getting Gravelorded here sucks ass
[5:44:40] <+Shishi1205> melted building
[5:44:40] <velgaduere> "it's hard. like ME!"
[5:44:41] <agsiar2> then why am i carrying a silver knight spear?
[5:44:46] <ds3namecaldara> rock is strong
[5:44:48] <+Jiggisnipe> @agsiar2 yea most everything was an illusion
[5:44:52] <%thotbane> its supposed to look like metal melted by a nuke or a volcano
[5:44:53] <%Prevot> @agsiar2 silver knights don't go away
[5:44:54] <%cubbywolf> burnt
[5:44:55] <captain_kirkhammer> @agsiar2 stop thinkin about it
[5:44:56] <+Grayhammatter> big burnt
[5:44:59] <BigYanno> It's weird to think that one day this ash will be the protagonist of DS3 LUL
[5:45:04] <@Solidus_113> big fire tornado
[5:45:04] <Aussie_Manny> that's pretty lit CurseLit
[5:45:05] <drunken_lemur> SUNLIGHT4LYFE!
[5:45:09] <ChoculaUltra> That's hell you're walking into, Reg.
[5:45:19] <%A_German_spy> @agsiar2 The city itself is real. It's just that most of its inhabitants are part of Gwyndolin's illusion, which is meant to fool Undead "heroes" into linking the fire and perpetuating the gods' plans
[5:45:20] <%dds333a> Maybe so
[5:45:21] <+Jiggisnipe> that is interesting
[5:45:22] <klooswep> It's one giant kiln
[5:45:22] <ds3namecaldara> to is it the protagonist because we stepped on it??
[5:45:24] <%SaintBeau> jermaPluto
[5:45:25] <Equirah> ........ No
[5:45:26] <+alphonseisbest> @BigYanno yea fucking WEIRD right
[5:45:29] <%MrATheGreat> I didn't even think about taht daaaaaaamn
[5:45:30] <fat_burtreynolds> NOT NOW SWEETIE
[5:45:32] <%SaintBeau> it's all gone jermaPluto
[5:45:32] <BurdRightsActivist> .....No.
[5:45:32] <Puhff> You think that's air you're breathing?
[5:45:33] <%cubbywolf> that's alot of charcoal
[5:45:35] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> ew reggie is stepping in it
[5:45:37] <Equirah> Woolie writting fanfic tonight LUL
[5:45:43] <KayleNikita> now dies to a silver knight LUL
[5:45:45] <+warlockwithapixie> I like that idea!
[5:45:46] <%MooseIsGoose> I think it got this big because of gynn
[5:45:48] <%SaintBeau> LUL
[5:45:52] <+Shishi1205> @Equirah the linking the fire cinematic suport this claim
[5:45:53] <+extradopeness> lm gonna find some more dudes to set on fire!
[5:45:56] <agsiar2> hmmm....
[5:46:00] <captain_kirkhammer> Can't parry the drag attack iirc
[5:46:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> it looks like a bomb went off
[5:46:01] <b_ikki> the whole souls community is founded on fanfic lets not pretend
[5:46:02] <+AnActualHermitCrab> "...No." Says some wise guys who can't disprove it for some reason. LUL
[5:46:03] <Awesome_Leaf> poise sips are too funny LUL
[5:46:04] <Slim_Lipid> a kiln is for baking 😐
[5:46:04] <klooswep> But that's just a theory...
[5:46:05] <@Solidus_113> may be an untruth
[5:46:12] <subjectg> @captain_kirkhammer you can
[5:46:13] <ChoculaUltra> so are the Black Knights just super hollowed out/souls burned but just still hang around?
[5:46:14] <%Prevot> @b_ikki so true lol
[5:46:14] <%tigerfang86> Souls lore is like 40% fanfiction
[5:46:15] <Dio_TR> OH NO I DONT BELIEVE ANYMORE
[5:46:17] <velgaduere> he's seen the R2 launcher
[5:46:17] <peachy996> Sunlight for life!
[5:46:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:46:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Stop watching Vaati, his fanfiction isn't the foundation for the entire series' writing. 4Head
[5:46:18] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> its a known unknown
[5:46:19] <DeathByPoke7> i always thought this was the aftermath of gwin linking the flame
[5:46:20] <velgaduere> briefly
[5:46:22] <ds3namecaldara> A video game theories
[5:46:22] <BigYanno> Probably killed them too quickly
[5:46:22] <BernieSandworm> either a big fire or a fire that exploded real big at some point
[5:46:24] <deeriojim> Reggies own attack prevented the launch
[5:46:24] <%A_German_spy> @Slim_Lipid With fire spyServed spyYum
[5:46:26] <+Jiggisnipe> I think you did back at the Catacombs
[5:46:27] <bosssbatttle> that makes sense
[5:46:28] <slackerunchained> Somewhere over those dunes is the Ringed City...
[5:46:29] <Equirah> @Shishi1205 inside the pavilion yes, not this whole area
[5:46:30] <chernabogs_bane> holy shot reggies poise. he took that swing like a champ
[5:46:31] <%dds333a> @choculaultra yes
[5:46:32] <%MrATheGreat> Think only a few have it
[5:46:35] <+extradopeness> believe in reggie
[5:46:38] <%thotbane> @DeathByPoke7 it is. it caused a huge pyroclasm
[5:46:38] <ChoculaUltra> that's rad af
[5:46:40] <+TheScorpionEater> I cant wait for the Plin Plin Plons
[5:46:41] <AnimuStewshine> his sword is different to the normal black knight swords
[5:46:42] <+TungstenViper> it just exploded
[5:46:43] <+pectusumbra> to hell with chat
[5:46:46] <+sevorai> Just ONE GUY
[5:46:48] <Deko_> A GAME THEORY
[5:46:48] <BigYanno> I do wonder what this place looked like before it burned
[5:46:48] <dmtjinni> "Fan" theory
[5:46:48] <+Shishi1205> big flame tho
[5:46:49] <%SaintBeau> it's a theory. a very interesting one
[5:46:49] <BurdRightsActivist> 4Head
[5:46:49] <swordoftheberserk> souls lore is all fan theories
[5:46:49] <deeriojim> very little is confirmed by lore
[5:46:50] <+Shishi1205> big heat
[5:46:52] <%MooseIsGoose> It is just got this big when gynn set himself on fire
[5:46:52] <+warlockwithapixie> In the first cutscene the flame was HUGE
[5:46:54] <Dio_TR> A GAME THEORY
[5:46:54] <ds3namecaldara> nah hella true
[5:46:54] <SarcFa> I mean feels like Woolie's interpretation is on point tbh
[5:46:55] <+Grayhammatter> a GAME theory
[5:46:56] <Rein_Paladin> lets ask vaati
[5:46:57] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> dont slip
[5:46:57] <%SaintBeau> that's just most of souls lore
[5:46:58] <xerotwo> Watch your step Kappa
[5:46:58] <%MajorCrasher> who cares? nothing is confirmed and it's all theories LUL
[5:46:59] <velgaduere> it's whatever, it's a cool thought. it's all fuckin theory anyway lmao
[5:47:04] <%TheOddJik> i mean when nothing is confirmed why not have fun with the theories
[5:47:06] <+Grayhammatter> watch your step boyo
[5:47:07] <%superc37> hey one guy stop being an idiot and LOOK AT THE AREA
[5:47:07] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> BEHIND YOU
[5:47:08] <deeriojim> but yeah Woolies interpretation is how I read it too
[5:47:09] <oglogyy> hey if its rad enough, its canon in my book LUL
[5:47:11] <+alphonseisbest> ALOT of souls LORE is fan theories
[5:47:12] <%JetpackMcQuack> miyazaki's in chat
[5:47:15] <dalmek> I like it, therefore it's true
[5:47:16] <%SaintBeau> the fun is about inferring your own theories
[5:47:16] <+alphonseisbest> all good woolie
[5:47:16] <+Jiggisnipe> most things are a theory cuz alot isn't confirmed
[5:47:17] <+Bitscreed> I always got big "nuclear blast" vibes in this zone.
[5:47:18] <Stofil42> always been kind of disappointed with how small this area is, but something something it's supposed to be underwhelming
[5:47:21] <+Shishi1205> wow
[5:47:22] <velgaduere> YO
[5:47:22] <+TungstenViper> Gwyn exploded by linking the flame

[5:56:50] <otterwolfy> Just a shadow of the man he once was
[5:56:55] <Stofil42> I do kind of feel like finding out Vendrick as a hollow ends up feeling a lot cooler than with Gwyn
[5:56:56] <slackerunchained> It's kinda a callback to the *Real* King Allant back in DeS
[5:56:59] <+Shishi1205> monkaS

[6:02:06] <emptyantics> RIP SIEGMEIR
[6:02:07] <Aydarkzero> goop ring
[6:02:08] <+lag2993> no the best way is arrows then call him
[6:02:09] <+extradopeness> im playing a BL4 run of bloodborne right now its good but reggie gotta play DS2 now
[6:02:10] <+Bitscreed> This has been a real trip and a joy to watch along with. Thank you Woolie and Reggie, it's been a treat. :)
[6:02:10] <Afrosamasenpai> RING OF GOOP
[6:02:10] <%justcallmebobplease> Incorrect - there is one of them that matters, all the rest you can kill fine.
[6:02:11] <%MooseIsGoose> bow down like 2 of them
[6:02:13] <slackerunchained> It's so damn roundabout.
[6:02:14] <velgaduere> Ring of Gwyneth Paltrow
[6:02:15] <%tigerfang86> Seigmeyer makes it ALL THE WAY to ash lake, hes a real one
[6:02:18] <Stofil42> not like siegmeyer ends up much better either way

[6:02:28] <Aydarkzero> did Reggie save Solaire?
[6:02:29] <DapperCadavr> Dark Souls 2 time dangPogU
[6:02:31] <+lag2993> no it's just arrows you shouldn't jump down
[6:02:33] <%IronOhki> @velgaduere I prefer the ring of flavor and protection.
[6:02:34] <youngking_kush> DARK SOULS
[6:02:34] <%r3dfall3142> Good job, Reggie. Good job.
[6:02:35] <+Bitscreed> So roll on DS2 eh?!! EH?!
[6:02:35] <%cubbywolf> how is your soul Reggie? is it dark?
[6:02:36] <+itsKrisD> can't wait for ds2

[6:02:37] <+warlockwithapixie> COOL GAME
[6:02:37] <+andrew1ups> I missed it lol
[6:02:38] <andre11dr> So next one......Bloodborne
[6:02:39] <subjectg> @aydarkzero solaire solo’d gwyn
[6:02:40] <+theoldone001> Gonna miss this series, it's awesome watching Reggie hype out.
[6:02:40] <%cubbywolf> It lets humanity die
[6:02:40] <%romulux420> ok so when's ds2
[6:02:41] <%Prevot> monkaS
[6:02:41] <TheButtravage> @Aydarkzero He did, and Solaire solo'd Gwyn lol
[6:02:43] <b_ikki> nfts
[6:02:44] <+andrew1ups> They beat the game?
[6:02:44] <%cubbywolf> no more mortality
[6:02:45] <%dds333a> @swesterly yeah, I guess they just wanted to move on after BB
[6:02:47] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> and humanity
[6:02:47] <velgaduere> @IronOhki I thought that was a candle?
[6:02:48] <SilverFaustX> ds2 next
[6:02:48] <Aydarkzero> thats awesome lmao
[6:02:49] <%cubbywolf> immortality&*
[6:02:49] <+Finnmac5> ds2 when?
[6:02:51] <%SaintBeau> No Gods, No Masters
[6:02:52] <+extradopeness> play 2 immediately
[6:02:52] <emptyantics> DS 2 HERE WE GOOOO
[6:02:53] <Stofil42> scholar of the first sin next year Kreygasm
[6:02:54] <+YoruM2> 2 is like reverse DS1 in terms of progression, very open first half that becomes linear.
[6:02:55] <Reveresao> @andrew1ups ya
[6:02:56] <%jinking79> Merry Christmas everyone
[6:02:56] <Aydarkzero> i missed the fight b/c dinner lol
[6:02:58] <+2Vibe2Check> @DapperCadavr dangBRUH
[6:02:59] <andre11dr> Actually next time is Elden Ring in two months
[6:03:00] <SuperGoblinPunch> DS2 please
[6:03:03] <+extradopeness> not scholar!
[6:03:05] <Aussie_Manny> Am I the only one who doesn't like the final boss being... that?
[6:03:06] <subjectg> @thebuttravage i honestly didn’t know solaire was that stronk there
[6:03:06] <%MooseIsGoose> Solaire goes back to his world and links the flame no matter what @WoolieVersus
[6:03:07] <deeriojim> merry christmas
[6:03:08] <+SilverDevilfish> Romhack of the First Sin time
[6:03:08] <snivins> Plague video time
[6:03:11] <peachy996> blech ds2
[6:03:13] <+retro_godfather> you can skip DS2 LUL
[6:03:16] <%BignanasTheGawd> It’s a cycle, light and dark
[6:03:19] <%cubbywolf> i like demons but demons is kinda... old school
[6:03:20] <%SaintBeau> DS2 is amazing
[6:03:20] <velgaduere> if you do DS2, please just do OG + DLC. Scholar is so bad
[6:03:21] <drunken_lemur> Are we going to get a DMC 2 situation?
[6:03:21] <%romulux420> ds2! ds2! ds2!
[6:03:22] <TheButtravage> @subjectg I didn't either, I usually kill him for his gear lol
[6:03:22] <emptyantics> DS 2 Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:03:23] <%SaintBeau> chat fuck you
[6:03:25] <+Caped_Eggy> Just play bloodborne
[6:03:27] <slackerunchained> Reggie boots up the game only to IMMEDIATELY be vacumn-sucked into an enemy grab attack.
[6:03:27] <VJdarkworld> Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, Elden Ring LETS GOOOOOOOO
[6:03:30] <+2Vibe2Check> DS2 is good but it's so long
[6:03:31] <deeriojim> The world ended and the age of Dark begins, Merry Christmas
[6:03:31] <fat_burtreynolds> Merry Chrystler
[6:03:32] <%SaintBeau> DS2>>>>>>>>>>>>>>3
[6:03:32] <b_ikki> its true scholar stinks
[6:03:33] <+extradopeness> people saying skip are actually nuts
[6:03:35] <xUrbanCarnage> Bloodborne then DS2
[6:03:40] <emptyantics> @vjdarkworld HELL YEAH
[6:03:41] <%Rasheedt> @saintbeau facts
[6:03:41] <%BignanasTheGawd> But some ppl let the light stay for too long and the world rots
[6:03:45] <BigYanno> So DS2 in like 6 months?
[6:03:46] <MrMoonGoose> DS2 best DS
[6:03:49] <%MooseIsGoose> Solaire goes back to his world and links the flame no matter what
[6:03:50] <%dds333a> BB is where it is at, however, absolutely excellent LUL
[6:03:50] <+Jiggisnipe> cept 1 guy
[6:03:51] <Johannen> DS2 skip
[6:03:52] <yukichocomilk> @SaintBeau no lmaooo
[6:03:54] <b_ikki> vanilla ds2 is way better
[6:03:55] <LunarRemix> Not even Elden ring has lip movement
[6:03:56] <%cubbywolf> bloodborne when?
[6:03:56] <%justcallmebobplease> @extradopeness Huh, you don't care for Scholars, for DS2?  Most people seem to think it's a unilateral improvement - what's your reason, if you don't mind me asking?
[6:03:57] <subjectg> i’d say get through ds2 first, so you can get it out of the way before long
[6:03:58] <andre11dr> DS2 is a 8/10 it has great stuff in it but every other game is a 9
[6:03:59] <peachy996> BB then DS2 is a good idea since the DLC to this is hinting to BB
[6:04:00] <xUrbanCarnage> Take break from knights and dragons
[6:04:01] <DragonOfWarZro> Part skippers DansGame
[6:04:03] <+John_Oki> demon souls
[6:04:11] <BigYanno> gotta let him forget how nice it is to be able to dodge properly before starting DS2
[6:04:12] <%megaman_sentinel> Bloodborne plz
[6:04:14] <%cubbywolf> and over and over and over and over
[6:04:18] <slackerunchained> Just ask Plague if you're confused about anything, Reggie. he'll explain it. ;)
[6:04:18] <BR0Speedwagon> And now you can skip Dark Souls 2
[6:04:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 2 is necessary
[6:04:23] <+vaderxyz1970> Best game of the 10's
[6:04:24] <subjectg> That said, i love ds2, people who say to skip are inconsiderate
[6:04:25] <LVL1_Scumbag> So basically bed of chaos
[6:04:25] <zocano> I think some of the enemy placements in Scholar are good and some are bad (most are good)
[6:04:26] <emptyantics> DONT SKIP 2
[6:04:27] <Stofil42> ds3 may be more competently made, but I'd argue it's a lesser experience than 2 looking back on it
[6:04:27] <Johannen> @fruit_pie_the_magician How?
[6:04:28] <SaintBeau> PART SKIPPERS hasPains
[6:04:29] <memealt> I just love the pvp of ds1, ngl, game has hella depth
[6:04:29] <+AnthraxJohnson> @woolieversus play Sneak King next.
[6:04:29] <OhGeeWhy> but they never could recreate it
[6:04:33] <derap41> and everyone that has played it wish they could unlearn it
[6:04:33] <+extradopeness> actually just stream this again then 2
[6:04:33] <xUrbanCarnage> Great job Reggie!
[6:04:34] <Treasure_Vault> some generic fantasy thing i guess
[6:04:35] <KellBeII> it ruins other games for you
[6:04:35] <%TheOddJik> @subjectg big true
[6:04:36] <VJdarkworld> LUL
[6:04:37] <%kyh9> It's exactly as good as people talk about
[6:04:38] <Deko_> gimme MORE
[6:04:38] <Pubstar_LTD> LOL
[6:04:39] <%dds333a> LUL
[6:04:41] <+pectusumbra> I wouldn't skip 2. Reggie will enjoy being a Hexer in that game for certain
[6:04:42] <KellBeII> like theres just nothing else like it
[6:04:42] <%kewlmyc> SKIP 2 Kappa
[6:04:45] <BigYanno> I really don't like DS2, but he shouldn't skip it, he should at least give it a try
[6:04:46] <itsno4ce> No going back
[6:04:46] <%BignanasTheGawd> Is it gonna be BB after ds2, or after ds3
[6:04:48] <+theoldone001> DS2 is a good game, it's just a little confused.
[6:04:48] <VJdarkworld> THE CYCLE CONTINUES....
[6:04:49] <subjectg> PLAY SLASHY SOULS NEXT
[6:04:50] <shieldanvil> i wish i could hemorrhage all soulsborne memories from my mind and play dark souls for the first time again
[6:04:50] <+Grayhammatter> and we back in
[6:04:50] <+pectusumbra> whether you want to do that or bloodborne first is another story
[6:04:51] <ChoculaUltra> I think the amount of bosses and dual wielding alone make DS2 worth checking out at the least
[6:04:52] <%dds333a> Back to the basics
[6:04:53] <oda_flobunaga> Next is the Surge?
[6:04:53] <%nickdooody> 2nd playthrough lets go!
[6:04:53] <lazysaiyajin> keep 2
[6:04:54] <sappinmahbinyot> I love DS2, for one
[6:04:58] <peachy996> From Chester to the faster enemies you can tell fromsoft was on the way to Bloodborne
[6:04:58] <AbnormalVoid> Yes Indeed
[6:05:01] <ds3namecaldara> boar cutscene
[6:05:01] <BurdRightsActivist> YES.
[6:05:01] <slackerunchained> They threw the Dark Lord into an asylum. Go figure.
[6:05:02] <%superc37> 2 just kinda sucks tho
[6:05:02] <TheButtravage> @andre11dr Eh, I would give DS2 a 5.  Would rate the whole series about a 7-8 overall since each release has issues.
[6:05:03] <%dds333a> NG Kappa
[6:05:04] <+Bitscreed> I have a soft spot for DS2
[6:05:05] <%IronOhki> Aand now you're huge.
[6:05:06] <xdeathknightx> DS2 is how Woolie fell in love so have to do it
[6:05:06] <andre11dr> Sadly DS2 has a really terrible final boss, both versions
[6:05:08] <Tempmael> time for BEAST SOULS
[6:05:09] <Pappajimbo> Demon on the roof
[6:05:10] <%megaman_sentinel> u have to kill it
[6:05:11] <+extradopeness> dark souls 2 is not a bad game
[6:05:11] <geassguy360> thus time loops
[6:05:16] <peachy996> And the Oolacile enemies
[6:05:17] <foghornleghorn55> go kill asylum demon. see how quick it takes you
[6:05:17] <BigYanno> Or maybe this is it, maybe this is the end of Reggarth's journey. He doesn't have to do any more souls games
[6:05:18] <%SirGO0SE> Show Reggie plague vid? @woolievs
[6:05:18] <DarknessHS> ds2 is jank af
[6:05:19] <%kewlmyc> Watch they skip straight to Elden Ring
[6:05:20] <Aydarkzero> DS2 has my favorite great sword
[6:05:20] <+Grayhammatter> beast souls? or DS2 next?
[6:05:21] <shieldanvil> the flow of time is convoluted
[6:05:24] <DragonOfWarZro> Skip elden ring and start Nioh Kappa
[6:05:26] <Stofil42> ds2 is worth it for the dlc chapters alone
[6:05:28] <+extradopeness> its a jank game but so is this
[6:05:28] <Deko_> still i feel ds2 is worth playing
[6:05:30] <velgaduere> Asylum Demon victory lap, let's go
[6:05:31] <%BignanasTheGawd> Ds2 is good, just not the best soulsborne game
[6:05:31] <+Jiggisnipe> THE BOAR
[6:05:31] <%superc37> most of the areas are ass, the combat feels like shit, and most of the bosses are boring af
[6:05:31] <+zodd_godd> Are they restarting?
[6:05:34] <derap41> Beat up Roof Demons for old times sake
[6:05:34] <yukichocomilk> I really don't like to play ds2 but i do wanna see reggie play it
[6:05:34] <%justcallmebobplease> LOOK AT THAT BOARLORD
[6:05:36] <TheButtravage> @extradopeness Agreed, but it's the weakest in the series.
[6:05:37] <+TungstenViper> BOAR MAN
[6:05:38] <hecklingmoose> DS2 magic fucks
[6:05:38] <+vaderxyz1970> I love DS2 but it is a downgrade compared to DS
[6:05:41] <+Grayhammatter> BOARLORD
[6:05:41] <+warlockwithapixie> I don't like that NG starts weather you want it to or not.
[6:05:43] <slackerunchained> Hey. Reggie... Wanan beat up the Asylum demon like a Bitch? ;P
[6:05:44] <+swesterly> ds2 deserves to be skipped tbh
[6:05:44] <agsiar2> the boar lord rises again
[6:05:45] <sappinmahbinyot> I like DS2 more than 1
[6:05:45] <Uncle_Christian> KEY DROP
[6:05:49] <BurdRightsActivist> DS2 Hating Andies in the chat
[6:05:49] <%A_German_spy> SLIGHTLY MORE PREPARED
[6:05:51] <zocano> Dark Souls 2’s DLCs are *so* good that it’s worth it for those alone
[6:05:54] <+pupil31> LUL
[6:05:54] <%megaman_sentinel> demon on the roof
[6:05:56] <Stofil42> everyone should fight the final boss of the eleycum loyce dlc
[6:05:56] <%cubbywolf> hello LORD OF DARKNESS
[6:05:56] <@Solidus_113> DEMON ON THE ROOF!
[6:06:01] <emptyantics> DS2 CHADS WYA
[6:06:01] <Arqartur0> the EVER BOAR

[6:06:05] <%A_German_spy> LUL
[6:06:06] <youngking_kush> I say switch up the aesthetic and do BB
[6:06:07] <VJdarkworld> RIP
[6:06:07] <ChoculaUltra> "ready for round 2?" walks away
[6:06:07] <+lag2993> DS2 is alright but that dlc is some of the best souls content
[6:06:08] <Tempmael> perhaps you should find your own answers
[6:06:08] <andre11dr> Oh God, if Reggie uses the grear sword in DS2 i will flip my shit in anger ,everyone uses that fucking thing
[6:06:09] <deeriojim> NG+ starting with no warning makes sense when you link the fire
[6:06:10] <+Bitscreed> Ivory King is one of the best Dark Souls bosses.
[6:06:10] <Stofil42> the fucking sauron hell gate opening up is worth it
[6:06:11] <Make_me_mad> DS2 is worse than the first half of DS1, better than post-anor londo.
[6:06:11] <OldManDeckardCain> the asshole key LUL
[6:06:12] <Johannen> Prepared to Die?

[6:06:19] <radspawn2> here we go again
[6:06:24] <nailwind> glad to see you Reggie here at the top
[6:06:24] <oda_flobunaga> @zocano tell that to the horses in the valley
[6:06:30] <DragonOfWarZro> Ds2 is the only good soulsborne game tbh
[6:06:31] <%cubbywolf> lol
[6:06:31] <BigYanno> My personal victory lap is to always kill the Asylum Demon
[6:06:35] <+JingKaisean> wtf? they haven't gone back here?
[6:06:36] <%superc37> hot take: the final boss of loyce is flashier than he is mechanically good
[6:06:36] <velgaduere> making it to Firelink, specifically
[6:06:39] <+2Vibe2Check> Yes indeed
[6:06:45] <velgaduere> @JingKaisean bruh they just beat the game
[6:06:47] <KellBeII> how ya feelin Reg?

[6:06:52] <28moogles> So we're gonna do DS2, right? :)
[6:06:56] <zocano> @oda_flobunaga You are talking to the one person that enjoys that area
[6:06:57] <%SirGO0SE> Ds2 would be the goat if not for ds des bb sekiro and ds3 fr
[6:06:57] <slackerunchained> When's King's Field?
[6:06:57] <+extradopeness> @dragonofwarzro those are certainly words you just typed
[6:07:00] <+warlockwithapixie> That's Dark Souls Baby!
[6:07:00] <moonmintparadise> do bloodborne next
[6:07:03] <Bedllama> unknow64Hype unknow64Hype unknow64Hype
[6:07:03] <lehvak182> Reggie looks so happy
[6:07:04] <+synthetic_sun> DS2 WHEN
[6:07:05] <peachy996> DS2 is such a slog
[6:07:06] <crackedhappiness> Has Reggie Played Bloodborne?
[6:07:09] <+TheScorpionEater> fuck it Sekiro
[6:07:10] <Deko_> now watch someone beating the game in 10 minutes LUL
[6:07:11] <Treasure_Vault> Dark Souls cool
[6:07:13] <VJdarkworld> Thematics PogChamp
[6:07:14] <velgaduere> @extradopeness that's bait
[6:07:15] <ds3namecaldara> skip 2 Bloodborne to Ds3
[6:07:19] <%dds333a> @crackedhappiness doubtful
[6:07:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:07:19] <peachy996> It's so... bland
[6:07:20] <nailwind> ds2 is gonna be a snail but ill still watch
[6:07:21] <subjectg> for once reggie’s not feeling hollow at the end of the session
[6:07:25] <bobxmaker> show him plague of gripes cartoon
[6:07:28] <andre11dr> DS2 is so ugly looking compared to the others
[6:07:29] <%superc37> @sir_louis so ds2 would be goat if literally all the other, better, souls games just didnt exist?
[6:07:29] <%dds333a> so he could do it, hell yeah
[6:07:30] <+lag2993> it's a passing of the age
[6:07:35] <+AnthraxJohnson> Sekiro: Chicken Fried Rice
[6:07:36] <derap41> DS2 goes far away DS3 stays close
[6:07:37] <+Jiggisnipe> clearly unplanned
[6:07:39] <+Malysitos> I want to protect Reggie’s smile
[6:07:42] <subjectg> nah skip ds3 and bloodborne, go to Ds2 only LUL
[6:07:43] <Treasure_Vault> Show him the other ending?
[6:07:48] <zocano> I mean I like 2 over 1 and 3 so 🤷♀️
[6:07:49] <+warlockwithapixie> They probably aren't going to play another one for a WHILE guys.
[6:07:51] <+vaderxyz1970> This is the creation myth
[6:07:52] <MinersLoveGames> Ill defend ds2 till my dying day
[6:08:02] <%Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Now that Reggie has beaten Dark Souls, how about showing him the Plague of Gripes summary of Dark Souls, it'd be very funny and educational.
[6:08:03] <+TheScorpionEater> Time is distorted in the land of Lothric oh shit i mean Lordran
[6:08:03] <%dds333a> some criticize DS3 for staying
[6:08:03] <+2Vibe2Check> Skip DS2, 3 and BB go directly to Armoured Core Kappa
[6:08:05] <youngking_kush> G fuckin G boys
[6:08:05] <%Prevot> DS2 should've been another D____ Souls, intead of Dark Souls 2
[6:08:11] <+AnActualHermitCrab> gg dude!!!
[6:08:13] <memealt> Do pvp next B)
[6:08:14] <%HeroToxiko> yeet
[6:08:15] <VJdarkworld> 7
[6:08:17] <+Bitscreed> Congrats Reggie! :D
[6:08:18] <emptyantics> Ggs
[6:08:18] <Stofil42> I just don't get why someone would call ds2 bland when 3 is right there being an incredibly samey, linear experience of churches and castles
[6:08:19] <%SirGO0SE> @superc37 yes :)
[6:08:22] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Gotta end it on him seeing Plague's summary animation lol
[6:08:24] <%baka_sugoi> sp00nD
[6:08:25] <b_ikki> now he lives in a post dark souls world
[6:08:26] <+Jiggisnipe> @Prevot I was just about to say that like FF or Tales
[6:08:26] <+lag2993> nah DS2 is good but still worst souls game fromsoft made
[6:08:28] <passserby> do Code Vein next :)
[6:08:28] <jorniev> TIME FOR BLOODBORNE
[6:08:28] <andre11dr> DS2 has terrible enemies, graphics and level design, but amazing everything else
[6:08:28] <b_ikki> it'll never be the same
[6:08:29] <%justcallmebobplease> Seeing Reggie get bit by the Soulsborne bug live was AMAZING
[6:08:29] <dsmastodon> GG Reggie!
[6:08:32] <zocano> Most of my love for 2 is the story and characters which I find much more enthralling and personal than anything in the other games
[6:08:32] <GHouseduivel> Joy
[6:08:32] <+SideshowMessiah> Congrats Reggie!
[6:08:33] <+twohitgood> can't wait for reggie to get to bloodborne
[6:08:34] <slackerunchained> Reggie would, legit, enjoy Dark Souls PvP if he got into it, I think.
[6:08:34] <nailwind> hold this crown Reggie
[6:08:35] <Marhunter7> I still find it kind of odd they never expanded on aldia's stuff from DS2 about finding out what lies beyond the cycle of light and dark.
[6:08:36] <+extradopeness> goodbye and please leave from video games
[6:08:40] <Visorak6> slept on it!
[6:08:40] <+Double_Tap_That> This was truly the Dark Souls of LPs.
[6:08:44] <subjectg> @prevot basically, it plays a lot more like a spinoff, which isn’t a bad thing
[6:08:45] <+Grayhammatter> we in DEEP
[6:08:45] <%A_German_spy> spyPraise REG-GIE! REG-GIE! REG-GIE! REG-GIE! REG-GIE! spyPraise
[6:08:48] <Johannen> @Stofil42 One does not exclude the other, people want BB
[6:08:49] <dundore77> you hollowed a bit sometimes
[6:08:50] <%MooseIsGoose> Now watch plagues animation
[6:08:51] <susukouhai> 👏👏👏👏👏
[6:08:53] <ds3namecaldara> exactly 💯
[6:08:57] <+Malysitos> Look at that smile… must be protected
[6:08:58] <+lag2993> DS2 has a broken healing system and all bosses are an easy joke pvp was lit though
[6:08:58] <%IronOhki> @Double_Tap_That We truly are the Dark Souls, Reggie.
[6:08:59] <ChoculaUltra> Artorias almost hollowed this man out LUL
[6:09:01] <+2Vibe2Check> Miyazaki didn't work closely with DS2 that's why it's poorly recieved
[6:09:02] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @waltzqueen
[6:09:02] <+SilverDevilfish> Chat could you imagine Reggie in the cathedral in Code Vein...
[6:09:02] <+swesterly> hopefully 2 is lost to the annals of history amid mobs and impossible space
[6:09:04] <foghornleghorn55> it looks super generic from the outside
[6:09:04] <Arqartur0> @WoolieVersus will there be a post-Dark Souls Korean BBQ photo?.
[6:09:06] <bobxmaker> Seathe why you have to be such a bitchhh.
[6:09:07] <resloxxx> @A_German_spy Remind woolie to show reggie the cut dialogues, artorias and oscar I believe he would like
[6:09:08] <+extradopeness> yeah just throw in dark holes now
[6:09:14] <waltzqueen> REG-GIE! REG-GIE! REG-GIE!
[6:09:14] <+extradopeness> on*
[6:09:20] <subjectg> Can you imagine why FROM is a highly valued company in the current gaming zeitgeist?
[6:09:22] <Johannen> Plague's Animation cmon LUL
[6:09:22] <slackerunchained> Every weapon is - essentially - a seperate playstyle.
[6:09:22] <+Xeogred> time for King's Field KKona
[6:09:27] <%Cozy90> great job reggie! <3
[6:09:29] <%A_German_spy> @resloxxx Oh, he knows already, trust me. They'll probably sort that out during their victory dinner.
[6:09:35] <subjectg> Now if only they’d give us that damn armored core game!
[6:09:40] <available_line> Time for DS2
[6:09:44] <peachy996> I think BB then DS2 is a good idea since you'll have time to forget DS and not compare it to DS2 so much
[6:09:46] <%superc37> @stofil42 bc its artistically bland with areas thatre either straight lines or circles, whereas ds3 has areas like lothric or the cathedral thatre practically mazes with how complex they are
[6:09:46] <andre11dr> Guys you keep saying DS2 next, you do understand that Elden Ring comes out in 2 months right?
[6:09:51] <Uncle_Christian> Noita time
[6:09:51] <dmtjinni> TIME FOR PVP
[6:09:52] <%sewermonk> sewermonk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Great job reggarth lord of Boar, now you're ALL IN on souls
[6:09:53] <ds3namecaldara> victory Din for Reggie
[6:09:54] <nailwind> biggest dinner yet for Reggie
[6:10:01] <@Solidus_113> you can't LP DS2 before Elden Ring comes out
[6:10:07] <resloxxx> @A_German_spy Cool, you and woolie are great for setting reggie the best lore and gameplay possible
[6:10:16] <zocano> Woolie is probably piloting for Elden Ring if they LP it
[6:10:19] <Marhunter7> DS2 with the DLC is a VERY LONG game
[6:10:20] <peachy996> You guys really want them to deal with Day 1 Blind Elden Ring
[6:10:25] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr There's just not enough time to completely catch up before Elden Ring no matter what they do, honestly
[6:10:32] <Treasure_Vault> You can also imagine all the abyss goo you see as fire turning wood to ash. It's a phase change.
[6:10:38] <%superc37> @andre11dr why would woolie habe reggie play elden ring before any of the other souls games when it may as well be a sequel to ds3
[6:10:39] <%A_German_spy> @resloxxx Heh, well, we really appreciate that. It's good to hear that someone thinks so. LUL
[6:10:42] <%IronOhki> @Marhunter7 Boy is it. I'm playing it for the first time and I'm getting a little burnt out.
[6:10:44] <ds3namecaldara> I'm going to it'll be awesome
[6:10:46] <$eco419> Did They finish it ?
[6:10:47] <drunken_lemur> Love the Lie!
[6:10:51] <VJdarkworld> cool illusion tho :)
[6:10:57] <+lag2993> considering this is woolie prob more likely to let's play DS2 before ring
[6:10:58] <andre11dr> DS2 and DS3 are very long games cause they both got 2 DLCs
[6:10:59] <+Grayhammatter> cool llusion though
[6:11:00] <Johannen> @peachy996 He never done a blind LP of any souls game himself, would be prety cool
[6:11:00] <zocano> A lie will remain a lie.
[6:11:03] <28moogles> I would be happy to see Reggie continue the series. Doesn't have to be right now, but I'd enjoy it.
[6:11:04] <resloxxx> @A_German_spy its just chat being chat, you guys did great
[6:11:04] <SarcFa> Honestly Blind Elden Ring might be better cause no chat going "Play it exactly like I did!"
[6:11:06] <Afrosamasenpai> big burn

[6:11:33] <%A_German_spy> @resloxxx Oh, we know; we're accustomed to it. But the positive feedback still goes a long way.
[6:11:34] <+TheScorpionEater> @andre11dr Ashes of Ariandel is relatively short at least
[6:11:34] <youngking_kush> Only one I've even caught live
[6:11:34] <VJdarkworld> @SarcFa instead itll be people reading incorrect info from fextralife LUL
[6:11:36] <nailwind> Reggarths in the hall of legends now
[6:11:36] <Marhunter7> @Marhunter7 Doesn't help that 1 DLC is a bit of a slog until you get to the last boss and another one is actually painful in like 80% of its encounters with the best bosses.
[6:11:39] <%Ensign_Epic> @A_German_spy u teh sux n r bed /sarcasm
[6:11:39] <+Xeogred> Reggie probably needs a break. I know I would haha

[6:13:37] <%Javaa01> The payoff for becoming human kerosene is in two games time
[6:13:40] <Archmortal> shout out to what Dark Souls 3 calls you and why
[6:13:46] <%superc37> @swesterly basically LUL
[6:13:46] <%Ensign_Epic> @HeroToxiko SOLAIRE beat him. SOLAIRE.
[6:13:47] <Uncle_Christian> Woodstock
[6:13:49] <+TheScorpionEater> Linking the fire is the Canon ending @WoolieVersus
[6:13:54] <%MajorCrasher> yeah I like seeing things
[6:13:57] <available_line> *laughs in Yoko Taro*
[6:13:57] <%A_German_spy> @HeroToxiko Solaire did 90% of the damage LUL
[6:13:58] <%BignanasTheGawd> I like the idea where if you don’t link the flame, someone stronger will come along and kill you and link it
[6:14:05] <%dds333a> It's not a bad ending, legit, but fire keeper is so much better
[6:14:06] <GeoGio3> or trying to get back to spend gwyns soul and getting the other ending
[6:14:07] <%HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko solire deserves those points
[6:14:10] <peachy996> Also drives chat insane
[6:14:15] <+Finnmac5> The cycle continues no matter what you do, the fire will be lit with embers again, and fire will continue again
[6:14:15] <+Bitscreed> Then Solaire can go chuck himself on the fire
[6:14:21] <%HeroToxiko> @A_German_spy points well spent LUL
[6:14:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:14:23] <andre11dr> Oh boy Elden Ring will have SO MUCH missable shit ,i can feel it in my bones
[6:14:26] <peachy996> Chat always ready to remind you on what you missed it
[6:14:29] <T_Sasquatch> I get why tho. Its not worth the effort from a monetary perspective
[6:14:33] <rasamune> Miyazaki like “SOMEONE will see it”
[6:14:34] <%A_German_spy> @HeroToxiko Damn skippy spyYum
[6:14:39] <Aydarkzero> it's great
[6:14:47] <%ChoculaUltra> there so many people out there who have NEVER seen Ash Lake
[6:14:49] <peachy996> from the smallest item to the most hidden path
[6:14:49] <Pie_Mastyr> basically the whole game is a vertical slice
[6:14:50] <%Deasmeister> Dlc
[6:14:51] <AbnormalVoid> I'm not gonna look at anything if it looks like a stupid slog for idiots and I don't play it
[6:14:53] <DragonOfWarZro> The world burns and becomes Nioh
[6:14:55] <%Prevot> Elden Ring gonna be a fucking nightmare
[6:14:55] <peachy996> chat will scream
[6:15:01] <@Solidus_113> and they STILL hide everything
[6:15:01] <stevenellis386> true art
[6:15:02] <dundore77> i played the game without reading the story the first time i still loved it but the story is just icing on the cake
[6:15:04] <youngking_kush> @woolieversus AND THIS WAS 2011
[6:15:15] <youngking_kush> Fuckin revolutionary
[6:15:16] <VJdarkworld> i always appreciate that From Software hide stuff to create secrets.
[6:15:16] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Also high detail of far away structures
[6:15:17] <%MajorCrasher> I agree, it is a waste of money LUL
[6:15:18] <subjectg> This is something you’ll see in Hollow Knight too, HUGE chunks are hidden behind breakable walls
[6:15:20] <+Xeogred> Based Miyazaki
[6:15:20] <+John_Oki> replay-ability
[6:15:22] <TigerClaws12> this was peak video hand holding era
[6:15:23] <andre11dr> Now time to send Reggie the Plague animations
[6:15:30] <nailwind> its organic and fresh
[6:15:31] <subjectg> And that game cost even less!
[6:15:34] <%JetpackMcQuack> now go have my experience
[6:15:36] <+doomsdaydelilah> like pokemon
[6:15:36] <knight_of_the_edge> woolieFUN
[6:15:38] <T_Sasquatch> There's a line where its hard to find where its just a bordeline impossible to find it unless you have the Internet
[6:15:39] <%ChoculaUltra> now just imagine the dank secret shit in Elden Ring oh god I'm about to nut
[6:15:40] <+Bitscreed> As someone else pointed out earlier: SOMEONE will see it
[6:15:42] <Archmortal> You're allowed to have a different experience than Chat
[6:15:44] <@Solidus_113> peak era of waymarkers and signs every 3 feet
[6:15:46] <+Jiggisnipe> yea foster discussion and multiple playthroughs
[6:15:48] <ds3namecaldara> what ENTIRE zone did I miss?
[6:15:48] <slackerunchained> Compare all the conversations in MGS that Kojima programmed in that you couldn't hear at all without the distance Mic.
[6:15:57] <%megaman_sentinel> ain't even got no legs
[6:16:03] <emptyantics> Elden Ring is gonna be SO GOOD Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:16:03] <Pie_Mastyr> aight, now I feel attacked
[6:16:04] <+Double_Tap_That> The big question is, which is the next step? DS2 or Bloodborne?
[6:16:13] <%Lion_kun> DS2 obviously
[6:16:13] <%A_German_spy> @ds3namecaldara Ash Lake
[6:16:14] <%Prevot> and Bloodborne is them improving further
[6:16:15] <emptyantics> DS 2 Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:16:21] <%Lion_kun> Now to step back in DS2
[6:16:25] <peachy996> BB would be done so much quicker than DS2
[6:16:26] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Best Souls 2
[6:16:26] <%dds333a> LUL
[6:16:34] <peachy996> I dunno why people want DS2
[6:16:34] <+swesterly> everything miyazaki has made has been progressively building on earlier ideas
[6:16:34] <ds3namecaldara> bro Miazaki just needs to make a Berserk game
[6:16:34] <OboTolken> I think one of the really interesting parts about Dark Souls is that for the most part you DON'T miss all this extra stuff, because the community is so strong and talks to each other all the time
[6:16:36] <+twohitgood> @Double_Tap_That i'd say bloodborne to give it a really different but same approach and feel.
[6:16:37] <+TheScorpionEater> @Double_Tap_That DS2 I hope. do release order
[6:16:40] <available_line> Everyone expects ER to be DS4 but it honestly looks like DeS2
[6:16:41] <@Solidus_113> who was it that fucked up on Sony's side?
[6:16:42] <+John_Oki> unmatched map design
[6:16:43] <evilchris22> DS2 notekChar
[6:16:49] <ds3namecaldara> I'd play the heck out of it
[6:16:51] <andre11dr> Witch is funny cause i like DeS more, I just like the setting so much more
[6:16:51] <Archmortal> Storytelling and world-design are massive, GIGANTIC leaps above Demon's Souls.  But I can't help but enjoy playing Demon's more
[6:16:53] <Afrosamasenpai> when bloodborne pc tho
[6:16:54] <Visorak6> And Sekiro bloomed out of it
[6:16:58] <+Jiggisnipe> @Solidus_113 Sony with the PS3 tbh

[6:18:04] <%Prevot> now we gonna have to call them SoulsBorneRing games
[6:18:07] <andre11dr> There's also that other not Dark Souls thing called Bloodborne
[6:18:13] <youngking_kush> One of us, One of us
[6:18:14] <Visorak6> DS2 is gargantuan
[6:18:15] <PunkZedB> Dark Souls 2 is fucking huge
[6:18:17] <%Lion_kun> DS2 is the largest one
[6:18:17] <%ChoculaUltra> DS2, flaws and all, is still such a massive fucking game
[6:18:17] <%dds333a> @thebuttravage exactly
[6:18:18] <+Mrbaconator> dark souls 2 is like the biggest one
[6:18:19] <@Solidus_113> Density
[6:18:27] <%Prevot> DS2 is the game that never ends
[6:18:28] <Stofil42> bloodborne is pretty small
[6:18:35] <Treasure_Vault> DS2 DLC makes it hypermassive
[6:18:35] <nailwind> ds2 takes forever almost to a fault
[6:18:40] <KaiserMario> You're still some ways before you can understand why Plague loves/hates DS so much
[6:18:40] <andre11dr> DS2 is like 70 hours
[6:18:41] <+twohitgood> elden sekisoulsborne
[6:18:41] <%megaman_sentinel> bloodborne has the best DLC though
[6:18:43] <emptyantics> DS 2
[6:18:43] <MeImoth> well DS1 can also get pretty quick after a few playthroughs
[6:18:45] <DragonOfWarZro> Ds2 disc 2

[6:19:20] <+lag2993> bb has that nightmare world which is bad
[6:19:22] <dundore77> Personally i like how the lore is however much you want from it. i dont play these for the lore i appreciate it but i dont read every single item mostly jut boss souls/items
[6:19:22] <peachy996> Wouldn't call it small more compact, there is no real bloat in BB unless you want to go into the Chalice Dungeons
[6:19:22] <%mr_sups> I look forward to Reggie VS DS2 in... august?
[6:19:28] <+Grayhammatter> pigeonholed
[6:19:29] <ds3namecaldara> Bloodborne is pretty expedited if you know what you're doing

[6:21:39] <+twohitgood> @A_German_spy imagine reggie starting sorcerer in DS3 LUL
[6:21:42] <slackerunchained> Faith was Nerfed beyond all sensible reason in DS2.

[6:21:46] <%Javaa01> Yeah Hex is fucked in DS2 tho

[6:21:50] <dundore77> first time i beat it i was easily 150
[6:21:51] <+Bitscreed> Faith in DS2 is still viable post-nerf. I got plenty of sunbro medals being a summon for a certain drake fight.

[6:24:00] <ds3namecaldara> make Gwyn's sword and armor
[6:24:02] <BlackermanZX> thats dope
[6:24:07] <Archmortal> I will say, as hard as miracles got nerfed in DS2, the way the magic/miracle systems work WITH the melee system is so much better
[6:24:07] <+lag2993> DS2 starting faith was so good why the nerfs :(
[6:24:12] <+Acecorleone> grief of the gods
[6:24:15] <Pie_Mastyr> it's magic, just citrus flavour
[6:24:18] <lotharrio> \[T]/
[6:24:18] <Uncle_Christian> 🤚🟡✋
[6:24:23] <TheProtomanBlues> can wait for Reggie go see Gwyn's Son
[6:24:26] <emptyantics> DS2 faith bros… :(
[6:24:30] <28moogles> I did DS2 STR/Faith recently and it's still good despite the nerfs
[6:24:33] <youngking_kush> Somebody in one stream said "What if rubbing Bible pages on your gun gave you Lightning bullets?" lmfao
[6:24:42] <%Ensign_Epic> Gwyn's son is the best boss in the series, IMO
[6:24:42] <%ChoculaUltra> they definitely overnerfed faith in DS2 with the post-launch patches. By over nerfed I mean completely kneecapped and left for dead FeelsBadMan
[6:24:46] <dmtjinni> \[T]/
[6:24:49] <+theoldone001> It's interesting to note that even in a virtual world Wollie goes back to his religious roots.
[6:24:50] <KyberNasse> Lightning Stake tho
[6:24:54] <SarcFa> DS2 faith just needs a lot more investment than it did when DS2 first came out
[6:24:54] <andre11dr> I hope Reggie dusl wields in DS2 ,that's the coolest part of that game
[6:24:59] <Uncle_Christian> TY
[6:25:03] <peachy996> I miss Krizalid
[6:25:08] <Jolly_Adventurer> Dude trust me
[6:25:08] <+Bitscreed> DS2 faith builds are still do-able. You have to work a bit harder but you can still kick arse.
[6:25:10] <drunken_lemur> One Guy?
[6:25:11] <lotharrio> DS2 Faith requires you to either use it for healing, or use the force spells... at least in my memory. Did get a few pvp kills with the lightning storm though.
[6:25:11] <%ChoculaUltra> receipts please LUL

[6:28:32] <emptyantics> @xrbubba The greatest SLOG
[6:28:37] <%IronOhki> Kalameet has like, one attack that gives you tail access. You have to defend for ages until he does that move enough times.
[6:28:39] <+Bitscreed> Jeremiah was a punk
[6:28:41] <+Jiggisnipe> the archer slips and falls
[6:28:42] <MeImoth> Yeah to get that tail you need to like spend 15min baiting exactly one attack and then not miss, its a utter pain
[6:28:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> No one beats gravity
[6:28:43] <%Ensign_Epic> Fog Ring helps to bait out the dive towards you, and that gives an opportunity to cut the tail
[6:28:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im still mad reggie will never know how bullshit that part is
[6:28:52] <%Cozy90> Leeroy made me disappointed
[6:28:52] <+theoldone001> Or Leeroy is just gonna stand there, MENACINGLY
[6:28:54] <Stofil42> I get every tail but kalameets on every playthrough, he's just not worth the effort
[6:29:17] <+Jiggisnipe> @theoldone001 and then punch you with his talisman
[6:29:21] <slackerunchained> Leeroy gat summoned for his invasion while his player was taking a Bathroom break...
[6:29:22] <%A_German_spy> @cobalt_phoenix_ For all we know, the next time we see Reggie playing DS1, he may be the mentor teaching some other young rising star the ropes.
[6:29:28] <%SirGO0SE> there are soooo many good DS remixes
[6:29:31] <+Bitscreed> Aviators do good stuff. Well worth a listen.
[6:29:33] <andre11dr> Leeroy slapping Reggie with a pendant was the funniest shit
[6:29:33] <%BignanasTheGawd> Time to go into hibernation until ds2 LP starts
[6:29:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @A_German_spy dude i wish
[6:29:40] <%Cozy90> Lord vessel by tanuki suit is awesome
[6:29:46] <GeoGio3> there is some dark souls hip hop too, ENB had some playlists
[6:29:49] <%HeroToxiko> hidden body can only protect you so long
[6:29:51] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Kalameet’s tail is hard to cut solo
[6:29:53] <%Prevot> DLC is magic resistant as fuck
[6:29:55] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus 100% agree with Oscar on this

[6:30:14] <peachy996> they are incredibly aggressive
[6:30:18] <andre11dr> Artorias rolls your magic too
[6:30:19] <Pie_Mastyr> reggie definitely needed to learn the attacks. maybe not 100% but enough
[6:30:26] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus And it also just goes to show how a non-standard, unorthodox build like Reggie's can do just fine.
[6:30:26] <+PkSilent01> Oscar of Astora used to have a bigger role in the story
[6:30:33] <%Prevot> bosses don't respect you, you shouldn't respect them either LUL
[6:30:39] <%A_German_spy> @TheScorpionEater Oh, there you go. I'd watch that.
[6:30:46] <peachy996> Manus and Artorias remind me of Ludwig where the ai wants to hit you if you back off to heal
[6:30:47] <emptyantics> Artorias shmoovin
[6:31:04] <+Acecorleone> new game+ Manus hit's different....literally
[6:31:17] <%Ensign_Epic> @A_German_spy that sounds like it'd be an AMAZING series

[6:33:28] <%mr_sups> I'm gonna say... August.
[6:33:30] <Decimated_body> lysPoggies NEW VEGAS
[6:33:33] <Paltheos> @KaiserMario I think they're waiting for the Pixel Remaster to come out next year
[6:33:33] <xdeathknightx> Just know Woolie: drop your shield, perfect, know what I mean?
[6:33:34] <+Bitscreed> @slackerunchained Yeah, DS2's highs are high but its lows are REAL low
[6:33:34] <emptyantics> DS2 is good but it has alot of problems
[6:33:34] <Johannen> See ya next year folks in DS2
[6:33:34] <Owlboy7> people hating on ds2 is like a meme now LUL
[6:33:34] <%JetpackMcQuack> do stardew valley or something
[6:33:35] <%Lion_kun> AH YEAH THE BIGGEST ONE
[6:33:38] <ds3namecaldara> scholar
[6:33:41] <+pupil31> RE RE RE MIX
[6:33:41] <velgaduere> avoid Scholar if possible
[6:33:43] <velgaduere> not good
[6:33:44] <28moogles> Scholar is so gooood
[6:33:45] <%Prevot> cause the 1st was so shit
[6:33:45] <%SirGO0SE> @Decimated_body i think you might be right, fingers crossed
[6:33:45] <%mr_sups> DS2 launch is NOT DS2 now.
[6:33:48] <waltzqueen> @WoolieVersus Welcome home to DS2! Youkouso
[6:33:49] <emptyantics> DS2 is good but it has alot of problems.
[6:33:49] <%IronOhki> I'm just playing 2 for the first time, and watching WooliePat's LP. Boy did it change.
[6:33:53] <+foomaster22> It didn't make it that much better....
[6:33:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the duality of chat
[6:33:54] <+lag2993> it's wild 2 got a remix
[6:33:55] <peachy996> I still say BB is the better choice because it's more accessible and quicker to do but ah well
[6:33:56] <+Bitscreed> I finished DS2 before DS1. The stuff I learned in 2 helped me finish 1
[6:33:56] <+vaderxyz1970> Just wait until Woolie has extreme depression then we will know that he is playing DS2
[6:33:56] <evilchris22> Play both
[6:33:56] <%jinking79> Reggie avoid the Hate and Pain of DS 2 Vanilla
[6:33:57] <Paltheos> Better but not great
[6:33:58] <@Solidus_113> "better"
[6:34:00] <ds3namecaldara> archer placement in original ds1....
[6:34:01] <KaiserMario> I like Scholar better
[6:34:03] <Paltheos> DS2 is still the worst Dark Souls game
[6:34:03] <zocano> Ya People are weird about their 2 dislike. It’s a mess of a game but people go SO overboard with it
[6:34:04] <emptyantics> “Better”
[6:34:11] <%Lion_kun> It will come one day
[6:34:12] <%mr_sups> With a bunch of good stuff in the DLC. Appart from Horsefuck Valley
[6:34:12] <velgaduere> Scholar was updated with even MORE artificial difficulty. it ain't better
[6:34:15] <+Double_Tap_That> Scholar is better just for the fix of the durability bug
[6:34:16] <+Jiggisnipe> it's different
[6:34:19] <zocano> I like Scholar a whole bunch
[6:34:22] <%BisoromiBear> scholar is hot ass
[6:34:24] <DuoScratch> Scholor is legit good.
[6:34:25] <%Lion_kun> Reggie vs Fromsoft will come one day
[6:34:25] <@Solidus_113> SOTFS has a lot more "haha big mob swarm"
[6:34:25] <andre11dr> I liked Scholar more
[6:34:28] <%Xaeveax> I think scholar is way better
[6:34:30] <+TheScorpionEater> I like it more
[6:34:31] <SuperGoblinPunch> It did
[6:34:32] <Owlboy7> but when is ds2 tough?
[6:34:33] <peachy996> Better is a difficult term when the entirety of DS2 sucks
[6:34:36] <28moogles> Scholar IS better, and DS2 is good overall. Souls fans are annoying.
[6:34:37] <%HeroToxiko> the hole on that one thing isn't there so yes bettr
[6:34:37] <ds3namecaldara> get 110 adp and it's dark souls
[6:34:37] <youngking_kush> It's the Non-omnidirectional rolling that does it for me
[6:34:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> SOTFS IS better, but the foundation itself is a bit shaky
[6:34:38] <+lag2993> it is better overall different but the scholar stuff is 10/10 gold
[6:34:38] <zocano> It did mostly
[6:34:40] <%TheOddJik> Regardless of your opinion Woolie, chat will disagree
[6:34:41] <+penjaza> The only worse bit is Iron Keep
[6:34:41] <%Prevot> don't listen to DS2 fans, don't shake their hands
[6:34:42] <Pie_Mastyr> scholar is fine, unless you are a speedrunner
[6:34:44] <+straeger> it fixed a lot of problems.  but it also made a lot of new ones
[6:34:44] <%chexmixisbest> its better poop but its still poop
[6:34:45] <+Bitscreed> Scholar fixes some problems but makes a couple of areas extra-bulshitty.
[6:34:48] <+penjaza> New Iron Keep SUCKS
[6:34:48] <JoshWithASpoon> Scholar has a lotta cool stuff, but there's definitely some dogshit parts for sure.
[6:34:50] <%Irridium> It's better in the latter half
[6:34:50] <KaiserMario> Some people just hate different
[6:34:53] <XrBubba> Scholar basically fixed the lighting and rearranged a lot of enemies to make the game feel more 'holy shit'.
[6:34:54] <SarcFa> Better in some parts, worse in others
[6:34:57] <slackerunchained> "Eyyyy... A GUY!"
[6:35:00] <+Bitscreed> Case in point: Iron Keep.
[6:35:02] <dizimous> The haha big mob swarms are AWFUL
[6:35:05] <%superc37> iron keep in general sucked to begin with tbh
[6:35:06] <+andrew1ups> Sotfs is better guys stop
[6:35:11] <emptyantics> Big mob swarms suck
[6:35:20] <xUrbanCarnage> Miyazaki shoulda made it
[6:35:21] <+TheScorpionEater> wah i'm not in undead burg wahhhhh
[6:35:22] <%IronOhki> I like that.
[6:35:22] <andre11dr> GAVALAN WHEEL
[6:35:26] <+Grayhammatter> PLIN PLIN PLON
[6:35:27] <%IronOhki> I like that a lot.
[6:35:36] <+Jiggisnipe> yes
[6:35:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:35:38] <%superc37> yeah absolutely
[6:35:38] <+PkSilent01> yes
[6:35:39] <Mushinronja> if you don't parry
[6:35:40] <GeoGio3> yeh
[6:35:40] <+Jiggisnipe> he's aggressive
[6:35:42] <youngking_kush> He can be a real fight
[6:35:42] <velgaduere> yeah, but if you parry him, he's still a joke
[6:35:43] <+Finnmac5> plin plin plon
[6:35:44] <LunarRemix> He's for real if you don't parry
[6:35:44] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus There's a real boss there, yeah
[6:35:45] <ds3namecaldara> I could do old iron keep with a bow 1 at a time. in scholar you're getting ganked
[6:35:45] <%Prevot> if you don't level so much
[6:35:46] <Paltheos> Then Gwyn is an improvement over Allant, who is an *actual* joke purely in terms of gameplay
[6:35:47] <+Shishi1205> hew can rock you
[6:35:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> IF you're underlevelled
[6:35:48] <%superc37> that guy is crazy
[6:35:48] <pavramz> kinda if you don't parry sure
[6:35:48] <peachy996> Oh yeah he gave Paige a rough time
[6:35:48] <%Xaeveax> If you fight Gwyn with no shield it's hard
[6:35:50] <+alphonseisbest> kinda
[6:35:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if you don't parry cheese and go honest he is real
[6:35:50] <%SveriSageAdvice> if you dont do the DLC, he's way more of a boss
[6:35:51] <Johannen> He is a Boss
[6:35:52] <+retro_godfather> idk gwynn can still be tough if you don't parry him, kinda like gundyr in ds3
[6:35:53] <%superc37> one guy
[6:35:53] <bobxmaker> gwyn is easier than most bosses, but he's no pushover
[6:35:54] <+AnActualHermitCrab> if you don't parry, he puts up a fight.
[6:35:54] <+balouie> YEAH
[6:35:55] <SuperGoblinPunch> He's a parry dummy
[6:35:55] <Onamar> If you can parry him he falls apart
[6:35:56] <pavramz> but If you parry it's over
[6:35:57] <+lag2993> he does damage but yeah you can just party though
[6:35:58] <dizimous> If you don't parry much he's actually quite hard
[6:36:00] <BlackermanZX> i mean gwyn aint a bitch
[6:36:01] <+Jiggisnipe> he's not the King from DeS
[6:36:04] <%Cozy90> for your first time playing against him he can be pretty hard
[6:36:05] <SarcFa> He is pretty aggressive, and if you can't parry for shit, he can own you
[6:36:05] <+andrew1ups> Plin plin PARRY!
[6:36:05] <+Bitscreed> Yep, if you don't know he's parryable and don't do the DLC then Gwyn can be a challenge.
[6:36:07] <andre11dr> Nah he can be real
[6:36:08] <+Shishi1205> or you are a parry god
[6:36:09] <+alphonseisbest> he's a Boss but not Hard per say
[6:36:11] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's just there are SO many ways to completely clown on Gwyn's ass, and since most people who aren't doing challenge runs usually just parry him to death, it skews his reputation.
[6:36:11] <Pie_Mastyr> if you don't have solaire, and can't parry he's definitely a final boss
[6:36:11] <ds3namecaldara> plus skill level
[6:36:12] <%superc37> the only reason hes easy is bc hes parryable
[6:36:16] <glass_marcus> yea, if you don't know how to parry him and your like lv 70 he's simple but tough
[6:36:17] <+0neReeler> sephiroth after the weapons
[6:36:24] <+warlockwithapixie> Also because Solaire.
[6:36:25] <%fart_bath> Gwyn is fine. Easy to learn parry timings and consistent breaks in pressure.
[6:36:27] <%mr_sups> Easily
[6:36:31] <+lag2993> yeah I would say it's more off an exploit on gwyn than intent
[6:36:31] <%Prevot> imagine getting to Gwyn at level 70 or something
[6:36:33] <Paltheos> The best feel is when you parry Gwyn's jumping slash
[6:36:33] <jorniev> gwyn actually fihts because old king allant was waaay too much of a joke
[6:36:36] <DuoScratch> I mean, that was Gwyn at his WEAKEST! You're only ever seing the weakest version.
[6:36:36] <peachy996> He was gatekeeping Paige real good
[6:36:39] <KayleNikita> that, what spy said LUL
[6:36:41] <+Acecorleone> yeah Manus MUCH tougher than Gwyn
[6:36:45] <%SirGO0SE> get parried once and get labled a bitch
[6:36:49] <xUrbanCarnage> I didn’t do dlc but 4 parries with smoughs hammer and it was over
[6:36:50] <velgaduere> LLLLLIGHTNING
[6:36:56] <+Jiggisnipe> I don't think most people parried him on their 1st playthroughs
[6:37:01] <%HeroToxiko> sun of boy
[6:37:01] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus The stigma of Gwyn being a weak final boss is that most experienced players learn his parry timing and he can be riposted for crit damage. Otherwise for a first time player he's hard aggro.
[6:37:01] <%superc37> LIGHT VANGUISH MY ENEMIES
[6:37:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i used power within and hornet ring, needed 3 parries LUL
[6:37:07] <%A_German_spy> LUL
[6:37:07] <+Baldzinga> LUL
[6:37:07] <KaiserMario> @peachy996 Which is impressive considering Paige's sword dominated that game
[6:37:08] <peachy996> She had to go full robot for that fight ith Gwyn and get the parry timing
[6:37:09] <%mr_sups> Has Reggie seen Plagues Video?
[6:37:10] <Afrosamasenpai> damn
[6:37:12] <+foomaster22> He is not that easy

[6:37:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[6:37:15] <+lag2993> if your going no parry and only dodge it's a tough fight
[6:37:16] <+Shishi1205> easy bet
[6:37:21] <%SirGO0SE> i got 70k on that last best LUL
[6:37:22] <ds3namecaldara> smash into stagger roll away
[6:37:24] <andre11dr> You can kill Gwyn in one shot with Pursuers, Dark Beed, and Red Tear Stone and it's funny as shit
[6:37:27] <Johannen> almost went south in there
[6:37:32] <GeoGio3> yeeh show plahue's viedo
[6:37:35] <+0neReeler> he's human
[6:37:37] <velgaduere> it's almost like this was a lore run
[6:37:39] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr Oh, you saw my highlight, huh? spyCappa
[6:37:42] <youngking_kush> You one shot Gwyn lol
[6:37:43] <peachy996> It's fascinating who is the biggest roadblock

[6:39:06] <slackerunchained> "Who's been sh*tting in my Bed of Chaos?"
[6:39:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> TARKUS
[6:39:08] <+Bitscreed> Gargoyles fight is iconic
[6:39:09] <andre11dr> The tree was easily the worst part, worst than Izalith in my opinion
[6:39:09] <velgaduere> FARKUS
[6:39:09] <Uncle_Christian> BIT
[6:39:10] <waltzqueen> TARKUS
[6:39:10] <Afrosamasenpai> TARKUS! TARKUS! TARKUS!
[6:39:11] <+Jiggisnipe> and FARKUS
[6:39:13] <Paltheos> Woolie, does Reggie know about vanilla Lost Izalith, where all the half-dragons have the aggro range of a county?
[6:39:13] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Reggie, don't forget to listen to that ost now, Gwyn's theme is awesome forever
[6:39:26] <DarknessHS> best boss Kappa
[6:39:26] <+Bitscreed> LUL
[6:39:33] <+Acecorleone> bed of chaos is unanimous that it's bullshit
[6:39:34] <+Jiggisnipe> @Paltheos he showed him that and how bright it was
[6:39:34] <peachy996> Reggie is super right
[6:39:36] <TheButtravage> @Paltheos I think Woolie did tell him about unpatched Izalith.
[6:39:39] <+Shishi1205> @Paltheos we showed hima video
[6:39:39] <%A_German_spy> @Paltheos We talked about it at the time, yeah
[6:39:41] <andre11dr> That's not fair cause the boss is unfinished
[6:39:43] <peachy996> It's the harp at the start of the game
[6:39:46] <Paltheos> Ty, chat
[6:39:47] <peachy996> Fuck that Harp
[6:39:48] <%resloxxx> @Paltheos yeah woolie and reggie saw along with the bright eye melting version
[6:39:48] <Johannen> Depths Curses
[6:39:51] <%Irridium> @Paltheos looked up a video and everything
[6:39:54] <dizimous> Do y'all think Bed of Chaos is the worst boss fight you've ever seen? I cannot think of a better candidate from my own experiences
[6:40:15] <TheButtravage> @dizimous For this souls series, yes I'd say so.
[6:40:16] <%HeroToxiko> luck is a skill
[6:40:19] <%A_German_spy> @dizimous In a Souls game? Absolutely
[6:40:25] <youngking_kush> The only part he didnt struggle at that everyone struggles at was Anor Londo Archers
[6:40:33] <%MooseIsGoose> The 2 tigers in DS2 DLC is worse @dizimous
[6:40:34] <andre11dr> He even got cursed witch was really funny
[6:40:35] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus There's at least 3 bosses you can cheese from outside the fog gate btw: Capra, BoC and Manus
[6:40:38] <+Bitscreed> Reggie did some good footwork during certain moments of the BoC fight.
