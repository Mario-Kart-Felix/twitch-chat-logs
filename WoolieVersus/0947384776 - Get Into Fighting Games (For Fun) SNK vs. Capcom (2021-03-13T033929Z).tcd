[0:03:19] <+relentingapunch> that's gonna be fun
[0:03:20] <+cha0tic_klutch> About to work 12 days in a row averaging 10 to 12 hours a day :]
[0:03:31] <leith_aziz> You've been doing a great job
[0:03:33] <+MrMediocrity> limmyFlexL woolieOMG limmyFlexR
[0:03:39] <shinji_ifrit> ALSO apparently there's going to be another Strive Beta, I'm so ready.
[0:03:39] <pkthepipes> nice job woolie woolz
[0:03:47] <%Jiggisnipe> insert Shiggy quote
[0:03:48] <leith_aziz> This is better
[0:03:49] <DaKnightWarrior> YEP
[0:03:51] <@Menitta> This delay is only good.
[0:03:54] <@akuda_bar> good video is good forever
[0:03:54] <DatAsuna> They need more time to implement BLITZ NETCODE
[0:03:58] <pkthepipes> feel that
[0:04:00] <%SouLucha> Absolutely
[0:04:04] <lem______> BLITZ COOODE
[0:04:07] <YakumoYomi> @DatAsuna NotLikeThis
[0:04:10] <@Solidus_113> not gonna listen about lobbies though
[0:04:11] <vonmarc> true
[0:04:14] <leith_aziz> FIrst day impressions are SO important. So make sure evrything works
[0:04:17] <leith_aziz> PROPS ASW
[0:04:22] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[0:04:23] <%Dante_Namikaze1> Woolie's eyebrow piercing is sticking out more than the other and it's bugging the shit out of me
[0:04:33] <shinji_ifrit> @Solidus_113 they specifically mentioned lobbies, so they might
[0:04:34] <Wahrow> Blitzcode for Sigma males
[0:04:35] <leith_aziz> Naah, im for rollback
[0:04:35] <%jinking79> Pot will get more buffs fir some reason
[0:04:36] <+relentingapunch> We will get there
[0:04:37] <dks_junkie> we SVC BOIS
[0:04:38] <+Mordexai0> Arcsys pulling a whole Arika on being open about things
[0:04:41] <pkthepipes> netcode install
[0:04:44] <MKII> there was a lot of jank to fix even the design ugliness aside
[0:04:45] <%Jiggisnipe> it might
[0:04:52] <@akuda_bar> delayed game is eventually good, rushed game is forever bad
[0:05:04] <leith_aziz> I hope the hype doesnt die down
[0:05:08] <@Solidus_113> the lobbies suck at a absolute basic level, they're not going to change dramatically enough for them to not suck
[0:05:14] <Man_in_the_Red> it would be a value add if lobbies were completely removed
[0:05:17] <DatAsuna> Honkai just added a GG style lobby system for their spring event and it's cute and all but still a hassle
[0:05:21] <leith_aziz> I like the floor system
[0:05:22] <@Solidus_113> The 2d pixel lobby is bad
[0:05:26] <MKII> they don't have to change a lot to be useable
[0:05:28] <Man_in_the_Red> the whole concept gone
[0:05:32] <leith_aziz> But I dont know about the lobby THEMSELVES
[0:05:42] <YVESSAINTMORON_> need a best of 3
[0:05:48] <@Menitta> Shoutouts to Cyberpunk proving that delays are good
[0:05:56] <%Jiggisnipe> ^
[0:06:01] <Man_in_the_Red> also Duke Nukem Forever
[0:06:06] <Man_in_the_Red> and Daikatana
[0:06:14] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:06:14] <%Jiggisnipe> KappaHD
[0:06:16] <leith_aziz> Cyberpunk would be so liked if it didnt get so bugged
[0:06:18] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[0:06:22] <+relentingapunch> LUL
[0:06:26] <+Mordexai0> THE POINT IS OBVIOUSLY BLITZ NETCODE
[0:06:26] <%Dante_Namikaze1> LUL
[0:06:30] <leith_aziz> Like I hear alot of good stuff about the writing
[0:06:33] <AstrodropGaming> LUL LUL So convenient
[0:06:33] <@Solidus_113> wipe the crunch sweat away
[0:06:36] <YakumoYomi> Well...at least I'll have plenty of time to devote to Monster Hunter Rise
[0:06:38] <+JaseAdrift> less than 100 days
[0:06:39] <leith_aziz> But it gets drowned by bugs
[0:06:49] <@Menitta> I love Cyberpunk but yeah....
[0:06:49] <leith_aziz> YES
[0:06:54] <+Deko_> PogChamp
[0:06:57] <leith_aziz> Maybe
[0:06:58] <@Menitta> BBCFRollback
[0:07:03] <+relentingapunch> ULTIMAX ROLLBACK
[0:07:04] <%JustToWatch> I can't believe Woolie delayed Guilty Gear Strive
[0:07:07] <%Jiggisnipe> it'll be Blazblue
[0:07:08] <%ChoculaUltra> FighterZ with rollback would be oh my god I'm nutting
[0:07:10] <DatAsuna> going back and fixing up old games would be nice but unexpected
[0:07:12] <%reknownblackcat> reknownblackcat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! GG happy 20month keep on producing the great product. whatever you choose it to be.
[0:07:12] <Zayasu> is it too late to save granblue?
[0:07:13] <leith_aziz> I want P4A PC port with rollback
[0:07:13] <Man_in_the_Red> Battle Fantasia with Rollback
[0:07:15] <%Dante_Namikaze1> DBFZ plz
[0:07:15] <@Solidus_113> Ultimax and granblue please
[0:07:16] <+relentingapunch> Ultimax Rollback would be awesome
[0:07:19] <@Menitta> I want P4AU port....
[0:07:21] <DaKnightWarrior> Maybe for FighterZ 2.
[0:07:25] <leith_aziz> Also GG Rev 2 Rollback
[0:07:27] <+FuqBoiSlim> Let's go Hokuto No Ken with rollback
[0:07:27] <+Mordexai0> GIVE CODESHIFTER COLORFUL FIGHTERS SOME ACTUAL NETCODE THAT GAME IS FUN
[0:07:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:07:39] <%Jiggisnipe> Cygames will probably be on board
[0:07:39] <leith_aziz> Of course, P4AU too
[0:07:47] <Samex_Comex> Zangeif is nuts in this game you can hit into grab
[0:07:48] <tzuin21> F it, DBFZ2 instead.
[0:07:50] <%Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:07:51] <Man_in_the_Red> LUL
[0:07:57] <+relentingapunch> Ultimax getting rollback would be awesome
[0:08:11] <@Solidus_113> and that port is busted
[0:08:30] <%Jiggisnipe> it'll most likely be something developed and published by ArcSys
[0:08:31] <DatAsuna> I was shocked persona never got a Vita port while every blazblue game did
[0:08:33] <+Mordexai0> Colorful Fighters is pretty damn fun
[0:08:34] <Man_in_the_Red> UNICLR is the actual real answer
[0:08:36] <+Superbro64> battle fantasia has THE MOST fucked final boss, I'll say
[0:08:37] <@Menitta> I WILL buy P4AU for $60 again. I don't care
[0:08:49] <@Menitta> if it has rollback
[0:08:53] <DaKnightWarrior> So good!
[0:08:53] <leith_aziz> Glad for +R fans, but I didnt really find myself enjoying that game
[0:08:53] <andre11dr> Oh shit, thanks for the no notification Twitch
[0:08:55] <Man_in_the_Red> hypest non Gear title under thwir name
[0:08:56] <%Jiggisnipe> yo that replay feature is sick
[0:09:00] <Marshtomp1662> That feature is absolutely bananas
[0:09:00] <YVESSAINTMORON_> awesome
[0:09:01] <+relentingapunch> I'd buy Ultimax for 60 if it had rollback and all the DLC
[0:09:01] <@Menitta> Oh god this is the most game changing feature ever
[0:09:11] <Zayasu> :O
[0:09:12] <+Mordexai0> THAT'S SICK
[0:09:19] <EX_shuffle> That replay feature is going to be so useful
[0:09:19] <@Menitta> Its fucking genius
[0:09:25] <%Dante_Namikaze1> YOOOOOOO THATS SICK
[0:09:27] <leith_aziz> I never tried P4A games. Id be glad to try them if they get a PC port
[0:09:27] <+FuqBoiSlim> The day FOTNS with roll back happens is when we as a community are finally free
[0:09:33] <DatAsuna> that's rad
[0:09:35] <andre11dr> That sounds nuts
[0:09:37] <@Solidus_113> Bite The Dust
[0:09:40] <+relentingapunch> That's nuts
[0:09:42] <leith_aziz> That is amazing
[0:09:43] <Plutoneus> got that starcraft 2 replay tech
[0:09:47] <leith_aziz> Hope ASW take notes
[0:09:56] <leith_aziz> Just GREAT news
[0:10:07] <DaKnightWarrior> More fighters need that.
[0:10:12] <MKII> that's sick cuz even if you lost you can get that cathartic runback against your decisions
[0:10:23] <leith_aziz> KILLER QUEEN ! BITES ZA DUSTO !
[0:10:28] <%Jiggisnipe> then it's like you never lost Kappa
[0:10:31] <andre11dr> "How do i block Zappa"Me "You don't" the game
[0:11:19] <leith_aziz> An encouraging mode that gradually makes you play better is still the best alternative I think
[0:11:22] <YVESSAINTMORON_> imagine LUL
[0:11:24] <Plutoneus> LUL
[0:11:28] <+relentingapunch> Achievement unlocked
[0:11:38] <+relentingapunch> Do 50 wakeup SRKs
[0:11:39] <DaKnightWarrior> The NUMBERS
[0:11:44] <YVESSAINTMORON_> Everyone has a coach
[0:11:54] <leith_aziz> Toturials are just not encouraging cause people dont want to read menus often
[0:12:18] <leith_aziz> They're good, but natural teaching is more effective
[0:12:30] <JayEarly> “you did 50 wakeup DPs” yeah I’m a Sol player what of it
[0:12:37] <%Jiggisnipe> advanced film study
[0:12:39] <+Slaterx_> Doesn't Tekken 7 do something similar?
[0:12:39] <andre11dr> I don't know, would people really even pay attention to that if it existed?
[0:12:57] <YVESSAINTMORON_> it could always be an option
[0:13:13] <leith_aziz> I mean would people pay attention to that ?
[0:13:17] <%Wool> Wool subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! One of my students is a major recluse. I found out that they were a big fan of Titanfall 2, and bonded with them over that. They're much more open now, which wouldn't have been possible if not for you getting me into it. Thanks and keep up the passion.
[0:13:18] <@Menitta> It also gets rid of the setup of making a recorded dummy character in training mode. Thats still useful but you can get way more specific situations out of this feature
[0:13:27] <azreal30> Hello Woolie/Reggie. As I can almost never catch a livestream I just wanted to pop in and say thank you both for the incredible Reggie Vs series on YT. It has been an absolute joy to see Reggie's journey to conquering this game with your support as Woolie-sensei. Cheer500
[0:13:27] <leith_aziz> That is an important question
[0:13:32] <MKII> if they collect enough replay data AI can figure out what is optimal and tell you
[0:13:47] <+riderstrike152> I've noticed this in vods and the like, but why is the Image flipped on the dudes?
[0:13:52] <leith_aziz> You're right, Woolie
[0:13:53] <Clundy> I just wanna see the game tell someone "You didnt press block once"
[0:14:02] <DingusMcBaseball> LUL
[0:14:16] <YVESSAINTMORON_> Wouldn't that strip the creativity of player styles in fighting games?
[0:14:24] <andre11dr> I don't think someone that just mashes on dp everytime would give a fuck about that
[0:14:28] <%Jiggisnipe> more info is always welcomed, what people do with it is up to them
[0:14:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[0:14:30] <+Shmario> yo this is svcfrom neo geo pocket right? man this one is hard to unlock characers
[0:14:41] <%gratedjuice> @Clundy never stop never blocking

[0:14:44] <leith_aziz> Good first steps
[0:15:00] <Clundy> @grated LUL
[0:15:04] <leith_aziz> I think Strive would benefit from this more as its a new game
[0:15:13] <leith_aziz> But yes, I dont use Replay
[0:15:28] <@Menitta> I havent been until Strive but now there;s a super helpful reason to watch replaya
[0:15:54] <leith_aziz> YES WOOLIE. People dont bother with Menu's, thats the issue
[0:16:07] <leith_aziz> They should, but they dont

[0:16:13] <metabot64> !uptime
[0:16:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 25 minutes and 19 seconds
[0:16:19] <YVESSAINTMORON_> it would still be nice as an option
[0:16:22] <metabot64> oh shit just here in time
[0:16:28] <%Jiggisnipe> don't be against options
[0:16:46] <leith_aziz> A single player mode that teaches you is the best option
[0:16:56] <leith_aziz> So many genres do this
[0:17:02] <MKII> SFV has a ”do a trial” daily mission but what if it were ”do 1 replay homework assignments” instead
[0:17:15] <leith_aziz> Like have for example an enemy that always DP's on knockdown
[0:17:25] <leith_aziz> That teaches you to expect DP's
[0:17:37] <Aydarkzero> My message would just be "you're bad LUL "
[0:17:50] <YVESSAINTMORON_> and the launch you to a relevant tutorial
[0:17:54] <%Strelok608> Strelok608 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey woolie if I main Slayer in Xrd who should I play in Strive
[0:17:58] <@Solidus_113> "start blocking attacks"
[0:17:59] <YVESSAINTMORON_> a fun tutorial like GGXrd's
[0:18:00] <leith_aziz> Or an opponent that keeps jumping, teaching you anti-airs
[0:18:13] <stabbityrabbit> This helps solve the biggest issue I think fighting games have had for a while: Gamifying Learning. Currently learning is just a boring menu, but other genres do the learning process way better.
[0:18:15] <leith_aziz> I did find Xrd's toturial pretty fun
[0:18:17] <DaKnightWarrior> Really like that idea.
[0:18:17] <brunoberserk> i almost missed the stream , so i have a question : you still has to unlock the hidden supers and the hidden characters in this port ?
[0:18:28] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus I think you're talking about diegetic ui
[0:18:29] <BMCx360> howdely doodley
[0:18:29] <leith_aziz> Bingo
[0:18:31] <andre11dr> "Sir ,you seem to only hold forward in your matches, you might want to rethink that"
[0:18:37] <@Menitta> I honestly dont think Xrd's tutorial does a good job with putting out specific moments on what to do in what situation
[0:18:41] <leith_aziz> Yep
[0:18:45] <+eanscrale> Points for more palettes
[0:18:47] <@Menitta> I think KI's tutorial is incredible
[0:18:52] <+Shmario> @brunoberserk yes sadly
[0:18:53] <YVESSAINTMORON_> like being withered in Souls
[0:19:02] <mr_sups> Work it into a character's story mode or something
[0:19:05] <YVESSAINTMORON_> or *hollow
[0:19:07] <leith_aziz> ^^
[0:19:21] <leith_aziz> Do it in Arcade mode for example
[0:19:29] <YVESSAINTMORON_> that would be so sick
[0:19:34] <leith_aziz> People are already gonna check that
[0:19:45] <@Solidus_113> how do you make the losers feel like they're still winning
[0:19:46] <tomikaze_> I like this idea
[0:19:48] <leith_aziz> So teach them while they're there
[0:19:50] <YVESSAINTMORON_> i think people would check the game out just for that system
[0:20:02] <+jordy_j_s> Brothers MercyWing1 Kreygasm MercyWing2
[0:20:06] <@Menitta> tie dailies around analyzing your replays.
[0:20:06] <mr_sups> Put a crown next to the characters name
[0:20:12] <+Shmario> kuumbaCool
[0:20:15] <%N051DE_> N051DE_ subscribed with Prime.
[0:20:21] <Man_in_the_Red> "add a style meter" is heard in the distance
[0:20:28] <MKII> and games like guilty gear already has tons of unlockables but they put it behind fishing
[0:20:38] <YVESSAINTMORON_> ^
[0:20:45] <leith_aziz> Make mode-exclusive rewards
[0:20:57] <leith_aziz> Dont stick all the rewards in one place
[0:21:01] <stabbityrabbit> @Menitta Dailies have to be the most underutilized tool for teaching fighting games. More systems like this are desperately needed.
[0:21:07] <JoshManVGH> You learn to be cautious of high rank clean character sprites, as well as high rank Punished character sprites.
[0:21:11] <leith_aziz> Encourage people to try everything
[0:21:41] <alphalejandro> Like a racing game ghost?
[0:21:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:21:43] <Man_in_the_Red> having colors tied to matchups with certain characters would be neat
[0:21:43] <leith_aziz> I hope this is put in a video later
[0:22:04] <+ManOfReason> THAT ONE IS FOR FREE
[0:22:07] <%wibbwobbler> a push in the right direction always helps
[0:22:08] <leith_aziz> Like post this to ASW or something (unlikely I know)

[0:22:24] <@Menitta> yeah like SFV's trials are so bad. Not only are they worthless like "do a 10 hit combo" or something but they just give you the in game currency which on its own is not an incentive because you can't unlock anything fast enough

[0:22:35] <@Solidus_113> The Predator AI opponents in Them's Fighting Herds all do specific things you have to learn how to counter, like jump-in's, zoning, and grabs
[0:22:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though a mainline game would need to do that in order for it to be noticed
[0:22:40] <leith_aziz> Glad to see Mori covering GG games
[0:22:41] <andre11dr> I wonder how much FG developers think about this, probably not at all
[0:22:46] <leith_aziz> I-No looks so cool...
[0:23:01] <stabbityrabbit> Anji lost his stomp. Why live. T-T
[0:23:06] <andre11dr> They probably just like "Nah get good fucker"
[0:23:18] <DatAsuna> I actually think one of the most underrated tutorials in fighting games is specifically the soul calibur PSP game lol
[0:23:23] <+relentingapunch> PogChamp
[0:23:28] <DaKnightWarrior> Can't wait to play I-No
[0:23:33] <DatAsuna> IDK why SoulCal didn't go as hard on it in the later ones
[0:23:35] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr: Im pretty sure they do, but they think about different solutions, like using AI when people quit mid-match like KI

[0:27:44] <Man_in_the_Red> give me Scythana, i wanna beat you with your own assist
[0:27:48] <stabbityrabbit> Brain Drain has a silhouette that's super similar to Jedah, so I want to see if that would transfer to gameplay.
[0:28:00] <Man_in_the_Red> Brain Drain would be Q
[0:28:04] <%Jiggisnipe> who's the Shark again?
[0:28:07] <leith_aziz> uhhh
[0:28:12] <DingusMcBaseball> its a feature
[0:28:15] <andre11dr> There's a lot of unused badass designs in Skullgirls
[0:28:18] <leith_aziz> It stays then ?
[0:28:18] <deafmelone> Brain Drain would be siiick
[0:28:22] <Man_in_the_Red> you see that coat and think he'd be anything else
[0:28:26] <+relentingapunch> Brain Drain would be awesome
[0:28:40] <leith_aziz> I can wait

[0:42:58] <leith_aziz> Maybe I wasnt here for that
[0:42:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[0:43:01] <GeltonZ> Oh good I didn't miss this! I love Match of the Millenium! This is my favorite of all the CvS/SvC games.
[0:43:01] <%metanitemusic> metanitemusic subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:43:07] <leith_aziz> Does this have rollback ?
[0:43:11] <alphalejandro> The 2 intros of th game are amazing
[0:43:11] <@akuda_bar> monkaS
[0:43:12] <@Menitta> cronchy
[0:43:20] <+Boner_Girl> the flag is backwards
[0:43:27] <YVESSAINTMORON_> knxDuwill
[0:43:28] <@Menitta> hey it is
[0:43:35] <@akuda_bar> @Boner_Girl it's like the truck flag, it's backwards because he's going fast
[0:43:47] <Darren716> Isn't it right?
[0:43:50] <leith_aziz> huh
[0:43:55] <Darren716> Like on uniforms it's that way
[0:43:57] <%JustYudha> It's the "right" way
[0:44:24] <+IceyCone> The sound option is "Set Up" on the title screen
[0:44:25] <+Shmario> we can see the reflex of the game on the poster on the wall
[0:44:33] <+IceyCone> I think
[0:44:38] <hmmokiguess> snk games on pc are ridiculously loud too
[0:44:43] <YVESSAINTMORON_> need it nice and loud for those speakers on the handheld LUL
[0:44:46] <DaKnightWarrior> The Brawl intro on the Wii NotLikeThis
[0:45:02] <@akuda_bar> it's a really boring long answer but basically the Army puts the flag backwards on uniforms to "give the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the wearer moves forward"
[0:45:03] <DatAsuna> can always drop it in post yee

[0:48:25] <+BlackMegaMan> Official Jank
[0:48:27] <Hessman212> thats actually nifty
[0:48:27] <AstrodropGaming> HyperLost HyperLost
[0:48:30] <Darren716> I wish they kept it split
[0:48:32] <+kumaprime> what the shit
[0:48:36] <YakumoYomi> The wonders of emulating handheld console multiplayer
[0:48:37] <leith_aziz> You about to share your Pokemon ?
[0:48:37] <+FuqBoiSlim> I'm getting flashbacks of me running two emulators to trade pokemon back in forth in Crystal
[0:48:38] <Super_Voltekka> This is what playing the DS Bleach games feels like
[0:48:44] <AstrodropGaming> Built-in Jank
[0:48:49] <+Guto_Martins> Rush is my favorite
[0:48:49] <YVESSAINTMORON_> there's no point in keeping it split lol
[0:48:53] <FairOnFire> rush is the most fun. sort of like speed in last blade
[0:48:56] <solidpython2099> Just open the in-game manual for the explanations
[0:48:59] <GeltonZ> @YVESSAINTMORON_ It doesn't stay split
[0:49:00] <Darren716> It's be funny tho
[0:49:03] <+Superbro64> "average" is a funny name for a groove style
[0:49:22] <@akuda_bar> @Superbro64 i groove averagely
[0:49:27] <+Guto_Martins> Average is the Capcom one, that's even more funny
[0:49:28] <+ManOfReason> "what's your style?" "Average..."
[0:49:30] <andre11dr> I think rush is running and short jumping
[0:49:30] <+IceyCone> The in-game manual is pretty on-point with the explanation, yeah
[0:49:33] <arkvc> eyy yo is this a gameboy
[0:49:45] <leith_aziz> What style is called "Average" ?
[0:49:47] <YVESSAINTMORON_> no this is patrick
[0:49:48] <GeltonZ> @arkvc Neo Geo Pocket Color
[0:49:52] <leith_aziz> Like what ?
[0:49:52] <+yeknomlive> grooves
[0:50:05] <Super_Voltekka> Who's god-tier in this game?
[0:50:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:50:08] <leith_aziz> (im not being serious)
[0:50:15] <+ManOfReason> you know what, average was probably meant to be named "balanced"
[0:50:16] <+Superbro64> @leith_aziz serious series: average punch
[0:50:30] <DaKnightWarrior> I love using Rush.
[0:50:33] <andre11dr> I think Iori is a god in this game
[0:50:47] <GeltonZ> C-Groove, S-Groove, M-Groove (for Marvel)
[0:50:47] <+Shmario> i like kyo alot on this game
[0:50:51] <+Superbro64> what game is iori not good in? jiyuGrin

[0:51:21] <+Shmario> welp the Switch has online...but this game do not have online
[0:51:28] <GeltonZ> @yeknomlive Switch has online but this game doesn't. No one has figured out how to do portables over the internet.
[0:51:30] <leith_aziz> just so you know
[0:51:36] <+smoshow21> jiyuAzrael
[0:51:41] <+nooshy1> Everyone is really good in this. This is the most balanced game out of the crossover games. Criminally underrated.
[0:51:57] <deafmelone> This is so sick for handheld
[0:52:01] <@Menitta> aw fug. Oh well still cool to have. I like it when portable versions get ported
[0:52:32] <PanicSwytch> Is it possible to remove the borders on single player?

[0:54:48] <+Shmario> AND u can switch characters in the middle of the match
[0:54:53] <FairOnFire> ore no... Kachi da
[0:54:54] <GeltonZ> NGPC is TECHNICALYY a 16-bit system

[0:55:22] <deafmelone> its not
[0:55:31] <leith_aziz> Okay Gogeta shows up in about 2 minutes. Its confirmed.
[0:55:31] <arkvc> amibitious bootlegs
[0:55:33] <metabot64> theres some interesting translations choices that I wish i knew the story behind
[0:55:35] <ThatsCriCri> I'd love to play it online
[0:55:35] <YakumoYomi> @ThatsCriCri It is, and it's only $8.
[0:55:42] <metabot64> like MBISON KICKS
[0:55:44] <leith_aziz> Check DOtodoya's stream if you want that
[0:55:49] <+nooshy1> "My" is just adding your own quote to the character and a color.
[0:55:50] <+Superbro64> games inspired from this is Pocket Fighter, and there is a sick ikemen indev game called SVC EX I think
[0:55:53] <metabot64> or kens power ball
[0:55:53] <+Shmario> AND u can switch characters in the middle of the match pressing punch kick and back
[0:55:54] <leith_aziz> I'll have to go for now chat
[0:55:54] <GeltonZ> @metabot64 The story is "SNK". All their translations are weird.
[0:55:56] <+Superbro64> which looks real nice
[0:55:57] <+nooshy1> Team Names and such too.
[0:56:11] <Doublemint_Dave_> man his idle pose is great

[0:56:40] <%metanitemusic> I hear that remix of Cool Jam
[0:56:46] <metabot64> dude this game got some mad broken links
[0:56:50] <andre11dr> It's hard to tell on this one but i think it's Ioris 97 theme
[0:56:50] <+Superbro64> I wonder what became of the sprite artists for this game in particular
[0:56:52] <+Deko_> i love that they have to do the voices for the moves LUL
[0:56:59] <+nooshy1> No Clark, but, Gief gets his ability to true combo into SPD @yeknomlive
[0:57:03] <%metanitemusic> @andre11dr Yes
[0:57:16] <JdotSweapA> Sommahsaauuu!

[1:11:30] <+nooshy1> This game came out just before SNK went bankrupt and got bought by Eolith. Like with KoF 2K and MoTW, so much love went into it as part of their "goodbye".

[1:14:11] <lavargreenmuyo> SamSho on OG gameboy is legit
[1:14:14] <%Ether101_Prime> How about Deadly Alliance on the the Advance?
[1:14:15] <metabot64> does he not have green hand?
[1:14:18] <alphalejandro> Alpha 3 in GBA was amazing
[1:14:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Are they playing in 100 percent official consoles here boys.

[1:14:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> No piracy here whatsoever

[1:17:35] <GeltonZ> Yup
[1:17:37] <+Mordexai0> In a perfect world, NeoGeo Pocket sold gangbusters
[1:17:44] <MrKaraz> the NGBC was so much better than the Gameboy.... i miss the clicky joystick
[1:17:47] <Skeletonmanners> the world was not ready for neo geo pocket
[1:18:02] <@Menitta> Much like Blitz Netcode, it was ahead of its time
[1:18:12] <+FuqBoiSlim> snk once again ahead of its time. crazy how they do it
[1:18:24] <+nooshy1> There are extra, hidden moves for every character as well that you need to buy from the shop in the bonus game menu.

[1:19:17] <+Superbro64> Athena was the first vtuber, the ORIGINAL vtuber PogChamp

[1:20:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Did SNK made Athena to help them vorner the latin america market?
[1:20:12] <Erroratu> Terry theme on Bison's stage really doesn't fit LUL
[1:20:15] <+Superbro64> @geltonz thus the circle completes
[1:20:22] <Super_Voltekka> Loving Makiu, the Magical Mist in the background Kappa

[1:21:12] <alphalejandro> Little purple Mamahaha
[1:21:20] <+McDumDum> does this game have online on switch
[1:21:25] <GeltonZ> @waffleandman You'd be shocked how many good portable fighters exist.
[1:21:26] <+Shmario> @McDumDum nope
[1:21:29] <brunoberserk> ONE BUTTON MAN
[1:21:35] <+McDumDum> @Shmario that sucks
[1:21:39] <GeltonZ> @McDumDum Nah. No one has figured out how to emulate portables over the internet.
[1:21:40] <+Shmario> Kyo and Terry

[1:23:05] <%osaka_daioh> amazing what this game can do
[1:23:08] <+nooshy1> Geese and Bison do as well, but, you don't have them yet

[1:24:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> her chibi breasts still bounce amazing
[1:25:08] <+AudacityESQ> Physics squad
[1:25:11] <nicversus> on his chibi italian leather sofa
[1:25:20] <%Liam_Engel> This game was so underrated
[1:25:36] <+nooshy1> Criminally underrated

[1:26:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Reggie Status:shook

[1:26:11] <+ManOfReason> Look at the size of that flash kick
[1:26:19] <arkvc> just inaccessible, I didn't know a single person with a NGPC
[1:26:23] <+nooshy1> Like someone saix earlier, going from this to CvS was a letdown.
[1:26:32] <+nooshy1> said*
[1:26:36] <anarchistPastry> yooo Pocket Rumble day!!
[1:26:39] <nicversus> apparently not so underrated that it didn't get a nintendo switch release 20+ years after its release on the NGCP tho
[1:27:03] <Hanbei1708> i didn't see the divide at first and i thought they were just huddling really close together
[1:27:19] <%Dante_Namikaze1> woolieMIRIN
[1:27:21] <alphalejandro> Reggie was like Capcom, he has to test it
[1:27:32] <+Mordexai0> This is the ONLY Capcom vs SNK game with Felicia

[1:28:47] <Darren716> Truly the end of an error
[1:28:48] <+Xero_J> It does in fact play Dies Irae if you play this stage in Arcade
[1:29:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> handheld fighters are a genre I need to get more into. I know there's gotta be plenty of hidden gems like this.
[1:29:28] <+Mordexai0> @fuqboislim Sonic Battle is pretty sick

[1:33:15] <Darren716> Damnit, got my hopes up
[1:33:16] <iocook> This game is so good
[1:33:20] <nicversus> the stage graphics in this game are miraculous
[1:33:27] <leith_aziz> Came back from the Gogeta stuff. He looks AWESOME AND SO CREATIVE
[1:33:35] <+Mordexai0> @geltonz I swore the Fetus of God stage is in this game

[1:33:53] <nicversus> Gogecoin
[1:33:55] <+gustavozxd> improvised voice acting huh
[1:34:02] <@Solidus_113> Gogeta to be the first actual tourney-banned character

[1:34:54] <aircitystudios> Free dragon balls lol
[1:35:00] <Hanbei1708> i was about to say that was clutch but then Guile jumped in LUL
[1:35:18] <+Shmario> nakoruru vs morrigan and zangief vs haohmaru
[1:35:22] <leith_aziz> Gogeta can look more busted than UI Goku, but he's actually weak at fullscreen, so he has WEAKNESSES, unlike UI
[1:35:25] <+yeknomlive> dam i cant even remember the last time a game got a banned character aside from like obvious boss characters
[1:35:31] <+ManOfReason> Woolie wanted to steal Reggie’s soul
[1:35:35] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Don't forget to check the in-game manual on stream. It's scans of the actual manual, bad translations and all.
[1:35:38] <+Shmario> OH OFC
[1:35:42] <+Shmario> RYO VS DAN OFC
[1:35:48] <%BusterRepukken> come to brazil
[1:35:49] <anarchistPastry> YOU ARE GOING TO BRAZIL

[1:36:10] <+matteasyplays> I don't wanna go to Brazil D:
[1:36:11] <+gustavozxd> this fucking stage atpCap
[1:36:13] <+Guto_Martins> Don't come to Brazil, don't do that
[1:36:15] <+IceyCone> It's actually from KOF 94
[1:36:25] <fernanda_ps2> the kof 94 racism stage
[1:36:28] <%BusterRepukken> which is a reference to metal slug im pretty sure
[1:36:31] <alphalejandro> Oh yeah, the battlefield country of Brasil
[1:36:47] <+gustavozxd> heidern AI PTSD
[1:36:53] <%BusterRepukken> anyway, this game plays so well for a handheld
[1:36:56] <+StrawberryPantsu> This game got NetPlay?
[1:37:05] <Hanbei1708> YOOO
[1:37:18] <GeltonZ> @StrawberryPantsu Nah no one has figured out how to do online with emulated portables
[1:37:20] <+matteasyplays> LUL
[1:37:20] <%BusterRepukken> Max said this was like the best portable fighter ever for ages.
[1:37:25] <nicversus> Pocket sized Gief, full sized grief
[1:37:35] <+matteasyplays> Yeah this game is legit
[1:37:37] <+gustavozxd> @BusterRepukken yeah there's a lot of capcom and snk handheld games that are really cool
[1:37:45] <+Shmario> Nakoruru vs Morrigan AND Dan vs RYo
[1:37:47] <+StrawberryPantsu> @GeltonZ Meant the switch version
[1:37:57] <arkvc> max is right
[1:38:03] <Darren716> Clearly the best handheld fighter is SFIV iOS
[1:38:03] <GeltonZ> @StrawberryPantsu Yeah that's what I mean too. No online sadly.
[1:38:09] <%BusterRepukken> you could lab in this game and have it translate to a full size KOF game I think
[1:38:11] <Darren716> I mean it had the special button, can't beat that
[1:38:12] <%TopTieramisu> real talk: ryo's tatsu looks way better than the shoto tatsu
[1:38:26] <nicversus> it'd be rad if somebody did a MvC romhack of this
[1:38:28] <+gustavozxd> Kyo with the punches is GREAT
[1:38:35] <nicversus> NEO POKE
[1:38:40] <+Xero_J> Oh my
[1:38:48] <Super_Voltekka> Well, she is the queen of the Makai
[1:38:53] <Darren716> I mean Felicia is a nun and she's luding it up
[1:38:56] <%BusterRepukken> I hope they port SVC Chaos sometime. Yeah I know it has problems but I still like it.
[1:39:05] <+matteasyplays> LUL
[1:39:08] <+gustavozxd> cvs2 online edition atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:39:09] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[1:39:15] <alphalejandro> Poor Nako, been harassed by Morri
[1:39:22] <+doctordunno> meanwhile, majima's over having a fight just offscreen
[1:39:30] <@Solidus_113> One day we'll get an arcade-perfect port of CVS2
[1:39:31] <%TopTieramisu> wtf that's a long shoryu reppa
[1:39:33] <+smoshow21> I would do thingds fopr CVS 2 Rollabck edition
[1:39:50] <%BusterRepukken> CVS2 stuff, the ball is in Capcoms court for that stuff.
[1:39:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[1:39:59] <%BusterRepukken> Thats why i think SVC Chaos would come first.
[1:39:59] <nicversus> Neo Geo got that disrespect your surroundings vibe with a giant sign that says FIGHT. The citizens of Osaka are confused, but nonetheless oblige.
[1:40:00] <+yeknomlive> majima is trying to help that dude cross the bridge with his sick jacket
[1:40:10] <Hanbei1708> Ryo seems real strong in this game
[1:40:18] <+Shmario> Dan vs Ryo and then Ken vs Ryu i guess
[1:40:19] <+gustavozxd> I hope this game means more ports of the old cvs/svc stuff
[1:40:23] <Hanbei1708> Haoh goes fullscreen super quick and air fireballs
[1:40:23] <andre11dr> So who's unlockable in this game? I know there's Geese ,Bison,Akuma, Billy,
[1:40:31] <%ChoculaUltra> Dark Ryu, Orochi Iori
[1:40:34] <+gustavozxd> not just cvs2 but cvs1 and svc chaos because why not
[1:40:46] <%ChoculaUltra> oh and Vega
[1:40:50] <%TopTieramisu> bites the dust fails
[1:40:56] <+FuqBoiSlim> it just has to pass the Capcom Test ™️
[1:40:58] <brunoberserk> man , we REALLY need a new port of cvs2 , with rollback of course ... i can dream okay NotLikeThis
[1:40:59] <%BusterRepukken> SVC Chaos has merit just because it has Demetri as the Darkstalkers rep and not Morrigan
[1:41:04] <DaKnightWarrior> Round 2
[1:41:08] <+Xero_J> Akari, BB Hood, and Yuri. Vega and Billy only show up in cutscenes I think
[1:41:17] <+nooshy1> Vega and Billy are not playable despite having sprites made.
[1:41:20] <+gustavozxd> svc c also has zero with a weird ass unusual moveset
[1:41:27] <GeltonZ> @andre11dr Akari, Yuri, BB Hood, Akuma, Evil Ryu, Orochi Iori, Bison, Geese
[1:41:30] <+Shmario> the secret characters are From SNK:Yuri Akari Geese Orochi Iori
[1:41:31] <%ChoculaUltra> aren't Billy and Vega strikes in the Geese and Bison boss fights?
[1:41:33] <+matteasyplays> Ryo kicks are LONG
[1:41:38] <%ChoculaUltra> *strikers
[1:41:44] <+IceyCone> apparently vega and billy are unlockable if you link to the DC version of CVS1?
[1:41:45] <%TopTieramisu> svc chaos gets props for using MMZ zero
[1:41:47] <+Shmario> From Capcom : Akuma BB Hood Bison and Evil Ryu
[1:41:48] <GeltonZ> @ChoculaUltra Nah just in cutscenes
[1:41:49] <iocook> Shame Billy Kane isn't playable
[1:41:52] <%ChoculaUltra> ah kk
[1:41:57] <nicversus> Ken vs Ry...o
[1:41:58] <%TopTieramisu> diaper zero > grin nips zero
[1:41:58] <+nooshy1> @iceycone nope
[1:42:08] <%TopTieramisu> green*
[1:42:11] <+IceyCone> wiki must be wrong then
[1:42:21] <%BusterRepukken> Ryo deserves more respect. His nickname is the Invincible Dragon for gods sake.
[1:42:23] <%TopTieramisu> what a typo
[1:42:24] <+matteasyplays> D:
[1:42:38] <+Shmario> Billy and Vega appears on Cutscene but they rre not playabe
[1:42:45] <nicversus> toss that pizza crust
[1:42:50] <TheSaltminer> this game was way too solid for what it was
[1:43:00] <andre11dr> Yeah it was weird how CVS 2 didn't have Billy and Leona but they gave us fucking Chang and Choi
[1:43:05] <%ChoculaUltra> wasn't Jubei in one of the minigames too?
[1:43:06] <+matteasyplays> RAN DOM Pog
[1:43:12] <CalderGaming> someday woolie will pronounce Mamahaha's name right
[1:43:17] <Hanbei1708> i like that 2P Gief in this game by default is Cheddah Gief
[1:43:18] <%BusterRepukken> this game and Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max for the PSP are my favorites.
[1:43:21] <andre11dr> And fucking Todo
[1:43:22] <GeltonZ> @ChoculaUltra Yup, Jubei mini game
[1:43:47] <alphalejandro> Ryo to Dan:...Rob, is that you?
[1:43:47] <TheSaltminer> CHEDDA GIEF
[1:43:51] <DaKnightWarrior> SFA3 Max has really good single player content.
[1:44:02] <%BusterRepukken> yeah Majin Obama made a vid on it recently, so many modes.
[1:44:26] <nicversus> look at all these mt rushmores
[1:44:29] <%TopTieramisu> psycho baaaaaaall
[1:44:36] <+IceyCone> Jubei, Marco, Fio and Arthur are all minigame exclusive characters in this I believe
[1:44:38] <%LastHazzerd> sus
[1:44:43] <+Shmario> now its just rivals characters from the same industry like ken vs ryu or kyo vs iori

[1:54:43] <alphalejandro> Even in a min game, Firebrand is still a A-Hole

[1:54:51] <BoogieDeluxe> tieThats tieReact tieAble
[1:54:53] <Clundy> is that the Arthur sprite for Super G&G SNES?
[1:54:57] <%BusterRepukken> its funny how even through they're competitors, SNK gives Capcom a ton of respect in their cross games
[1:55:07] <+Xero_J> You can even learn special moves for all the fighters here
[1:55:17] <primarch_lupercal> better than the og G&G Kappa
[1:55:18] <+Xero_J> Like, Sakura can learn the Raging Demon
[1:55:19] <reddpop_> I still it's crazy that Firebrand made it to two marvel games
[1:55:27] <%ChoculaUltra> Capcom showed a lot of love too - those special character intros in CvS2 are art.

[1:58:52] <nicversus> gettin some metal slug in here
[1:58:52] <@Menitta> yoooo
[1:58:54] <cellaccount> lol what
[1:58:57] <@Menitta> this is so sick
[1:58:57] <nicversus> heavy machineg'n
[1:58:57] <+IceyCone> If you press Star while loading you get Fio instead as well
[1:59:05] <alphalejandro> Laser
[1:59:06] <+stardustdood> hold start on metal slug and you get Fio
[1:59:10] <DomonTrigger> The mars people look like floating boobs
[1:59:10] <Super_Voltekka> BEE SCOOBY DEE DOO
[1:59:17] <+matteasyplays> Metal Slug 2 is doable
[1:59:17] <@Menitta> How the hell can one 1CC metal slug
[1:59:24] <SomersaultJustice> if this was the final boss, it was either 2 or X
[1:59:24] <TigerClaws12> reggie labbed metal slug? Reggie was rich LUL
[1:59:27] <nicversus> it was probably X
[1:59:30] <@Solidus_113> Probably X
[1:59:32] <@Menitta> I've tried to 1CC 3 and I just couldnt
[1:59:33] <+IceyCone> It was X
[1:59:35] <+matteasyplays> Yeah it might be X
[1:59:37] <+Rekinsinn> Sounds like 3?
[1:59:41] <+yeknomlive> that was x/2?
[1:59:41] <nicversus> I own X on MVS
[1:59:43] <+Ghoullord87> 2
[1:59:45] <nicversus> it was X
[1:59:52] <%ChoculaUltra> gg Earth
[1:59:54] <+matteasyplays> HAHA
[1:59:57] <+Guto_Martins> play it again holding start!
[2:00:01] <Super_Voltekka> The new Point Blank game looking trash
[2:00:06] <nicversus> actually I own both 2 and X
[2:00:32] <+yeknomlive> x was just a better version of 2 wasnt it?
[2:00:33] <nicversus> X is basically just Metal Slug 2 but with the Metal Slug 3 chipset for improved framerates
[2:00:38] <$jessemcgrather> Cheer500 do you think you will play no more heroes 3 on the channel when it comes out and maybe on more heroes 1 and 2 before it comes out I would love to see reggie's reaction to the first two games
[2:00:39] <+matteasyplays> LUL
[2:00:41] <Saltmeisterr> oh shit it jubei
[2:00:44] <nicversus> there's a ton of slowdown still, but it's notably better
[2:00:51] <alphalejandro> This is what Jubei does when he's not serving the Tokus
[2:00:56] <nicversus> plus they changed the time of day in some stages and made the music better
[2:01:10] <%Sparkseid> the scmix
[2:01:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:01:15] <nicversus> it's basically Metal Slug 2 DX, and it's my fav metal slug
[2:01:46] <+matteasyplays> LUL
[2:01:51] <cellaccount> impossible
[2:01:54] <%ChoculaUltra> this is brutal
[2:02:01] <Mach5Mike> yovgLUL
[2:02:04] <Saltmeisterr> jubei's a tax collector right?
[2:02:08] <+yeknomlive> metal slug 3 is my fav but i think x is the most fair
[2:02:11] <nicversus> gettin a whiff
[2:02:13] <nicversus> snoof snoof
[2:02:16] <%Sparkseid> sajam200
[2:02:28] <SomersaultJustice> watching max go through metal slug 3 for the first time was a treat
[2:02:43] <%BusterRepukken> watching Max go through Last Blade 2 though
[2:02:49] <nicversus> oh yeah when he was doing the streaming service one?
[2:02:54] <+nooshy1> Do a First Blast run!
[2:02:59] <+yeknomlive> he did that the other day
[2:03:00] <@Menitta> what a love letter to capcom and SNK
[2:03:01] <SomersaultJustice> I sort of don't believe he never played last blade 2 for this long
[2:03:02] <@Menitta> thats so cool
[2:03:08] <Darren716> Calling people ugly
[2:03:14] <WanderingYoren> you make me SAD
[2:03:14] <Saltmeisterr> are any of the metal slug characters in any of snk vs capcom games?
[2:03:16] <Darren716> Girls in this game have 0 chill
[2:03:16] <DaKnightWarrior> Great game.
[2:03:25] <%BusterRepukken> Fio was in KOF 2006 i think
[2:03:26] <arkvc> good times, it was grrreat
[2:03:26] <@Solidus_113> playstyle WACK, combos WACK
[2:03:29] <GeltonZ> Easily my favorite SNK vs Capcom game.
[2:03:36] <+yeknomlive> marco was in neo geo bc
[2:03:46] <+yeknomlive> and mars people
[2:04:02] <GeltonZ> @Saltmeisterr Mars People in SvC: Chaos
[2:04:21] <arkvc> nmh3 looks good ye
[2:04:29] <nicversus> glad I woke up to catch this
[2:04:38] <metabot64> When is woolie gonna play GODDAMN SUPERHEROES
[2:04:41] <hmmokiguess> would you play killer7 tho? unless you have already played it
[2:04:45] <SomersaultJustice> what's the next game?
[2:04:52] <%BusterRepukken> has Woolie played the Doom Eternal DLC
[2:04:55] <@Menitta> how punch
[2:04:58] <SomersaultJustice> reggie, with ryu buffed, are you back in sfv?
[2:04:58] <%DashXero> Sweet. I managed to catch this.
[2:05:01] <Darren716> When's Infinite Versus 2?
[2:05:08] <@Menitta> good
[2:05:11] <Super_Voltekka> Has Team Spooky streamed this yet?
[2:05:23] <%BusterRepukken> its still SFV unfortunately
[2:05:30] <iocook> What's your most underrated fighting game?
[2:05:32] <Anastie> Which fighting game do think has the best visuals?
[2:05:33] <WanderingYoren> reggie feels gross playing a good char
[2:05:34] <lifeisdestiny> it feels so dirty
[2:05:35] <nicversus> It's like playing easy mode
[2:05:37] <WanderingYoren> I understand
[2:05:41] <lifeisdestiny> How is it dirty
[2:05:42] <DaKnightWarrior> Ryu too good for you now LUL
[2:05:42] <%Mcmuffin______> whats a good fighting game for noob to genre
[2:05:49] <%Dante_Namikaze1> SPOLIED
[2:05:50] <SomersaultJustice> yes, give those gifts to Nash pls
[2:05:51] <+eanscrale> Spoken like a true shoto main
[2:05:52] <+smoshow21> They over-buffed him!
[2:05:56] <arkvc> I feel you reggie, your honor feels sullied after they handed you the rocket launcher
[2:06:00] <%DashXero> Gluttons unhappy with the riches of heaven.
[2:06:00] <nicversus> this is Wile E Coyote catching the Roadrunner
[2:06:04] <Evendrag> nope, just take him being top tier now
[2:06:10] <Evendrag> no, make people mad!
[2:06:14] <+megamanx74> I will always hate ryu...
[2:06:22] <GeltonZ> I feel Reggie so hard right now
[2:06:22] <APB_Harleqyn> Where does everyone think the GG Strive community will settle, console or PC? Rev 2 on console became hard to find games on after a while as everyone was on PC.
[2:06:24] <%Dante_Namikaze1> Let them be mad
[2:06:26] <+drk_sd> no one is mad at ryu
[2:06:32] <Evendrag> why u gotta be this nice reggie...
[2:06:38] <jetjagger222> now you know how us potemkin mains feel
[2:06:39] <GeltonZ> Reggie, you've just described why I quit Guilty Gear.
[2:06:41] <+ChrisAlgoo> I play Ky that is a mood
[2:06:43] <Darren716> This is a specific location
[2:06:43] <WanderingYoren> the gall
[2:06:45] <@Menitta> ALL THE RICHES IN THE WORLD
[2:06:46] <Evendrag> stop taking Ls and hand them out instead
[2:06:47] <+drk_sd> balancing is just shifted towards esports
[2:06:49] <Darren716> *comparison
[2:06:52] <arkvc> what am I gonna do with this 2nd wii BibleThump
[2:06:53] <WanderingYoren> the shoto gall of this reg
[2:06:54] <+yeknomlive> ryu and dirty is a weird combo
[2:07:11] <Evendrag> but reggie, youve been playing ryu all this time
[2:07:11] <arkvc> degen ryu with the long tongue and shit
[2:07:34] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:07:48] <Evendrag> i dont get this mentality AT ALL, like i understand you, but nah just take him being good
[2:07:54] <%ChoculaUltra> so the answer doesn't like in the heart of battle? FeelsBadMan
[2:08:01] <Evendrag> youve been playing him all this time, its your time in the light
[2:08:01] <DaKnightWarrior> Easy to laern hard to master.
[2:08:17] <jetjagger222> wind kick spammers
[2:08:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[2:08:21] <@Menitta> tbf the game was free with Jago
[2:08:22] <@Solidus_113> Wasn't Jago also the free character?
[2:08:32] <arkvc> I think the fear is not wanting to get used to this because you know he'll be nerfed once public sentiment gets bad enough
[2:08:37] <%Dante_Namikaze1> I like my shotos stop hating
[2:08:45] <TheQuadrupleS> But I always love playing the MC
[2:08:49] <GeltonZ> @ChoculaUltra The answer lied in the heart of Fortnite
[2:08:50] <@Menitta> Oh yeah KI had the rotating free character
[2:08:51] <SomersaultJustice> necalli
[2:08:58] <%Dante_Namikaze1> Vergil
[2:09:01] <@Solidus_113> Vergil
[2:09:09] <+yeknomlive> that girl from samsho
[2:09:13] <@Menitta> Vergil wasn't buffed though. He started amazing
[2:09:16] <+yeknomlive> darling dagger?
[2:09:19] <@Solidus_113> Darli got some pretty good buffs
[2:09:20] <+yeknomlive> forgot her name
[2:09:27] <SomersaultJustice> nagoryuki might get that, who knows
[2:09:29] <+yeknomlive> mmk
[2:09:32] <jetjagger222> kotal in MKX?
[2:09:37] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:09:43] <astro_yojimbo> Do you think if fighting games tied in-game currency to doing fundamentals, like anti airing and throw teching, it would help get new players stay with it?
[2:09:54] <@Menitta> what about like Steve Fox? Was he as good as he was in 7 before?
[2:09:55] <CalderGaming> for me, going from Rev2 Ramlethal to Strive Beta Ramlethal was a treat
[2:09:58] <Tryhardblackguy> I want to play more Sam Sho but the online is trash, idk how to play people on parsec
[2:10:16] <Evendrag> Steve is always good
[2:10:31] <%ChoculaUltra> oh my god CvS2 Sagat.
[2:10:32] <%BusterRepukken> tfw im a Genjuro guy feel free to forward your hate mail
[2:10:51] <+smoshow21> Pick a top tier
[2:11:05] <nicversus> the fate of a blanka fighter
[2:11:06] <DaKnightWarrior> That's some good RNG
[2:11:18] <TheBlixster> Sagat Cr.Fierce
[2:11:26] <TheBlixster> all day
[2:11:36] <snarfguy> Pretty sure Woolie is using his connections at Arcsys to delay Strive so he has enough time to upload his lore videos gonna be honest
[2:11:38] <SomersaultJustice> you going hard into the struggle
[2:11:47] <%DashXero> Some people just need to struggle.
[2:11:48] <Evendrag> but falke is also really good now
[2:11:49] <%Dante_Namikaze1> Just pick a top tier
[2:11:49] <WanderingYoren> What's G like these days?
[2:11:52] <SomersaultJustice> business ninja wants you to work late
[2:11:54] <+smoshow21> Join the Menat army Reggie
[2:11:58] <@Solidus_113> What about Seth?
[2:11:58] <%Dante_Namikaze1> Zeku and Juri are cool
[2:12:07] <jetjagger222> special into special
[2:12:11] <Saltmeisterr> didn't G get like hard nerfed?
[2:12:13] <@Menitta> I would love another GIFG with SFV with the Winter update
[2:12:26] <+yeknomlive> i keep wanting to pick up cody but he's so different
[2:12:28] <@Solidus_113> Maybe after Rose comes out
[2:12:34] <%ChoculaUltra> ooo yeah, Getting Into V-Shift would be dope
[2:12:35] <TigerClaws12> that's a cold take
[2:12:42] <DaKnightWarrior> Good take
[2:12:42] <%Sparkseid> ^
[2:12:44] <@Menitta> Thats not controversial at all
[2:12:58] <AstrodropGaming> That's cold glacial take Woolie
[2:12:58] <+yeknomlive> i thought everyone preferred sf4 juri
[2:13:01] <%Dante_Namikaze1> it's not controversial as a Juri player it sucks
[2:13:03] <+smoshow21> SF IV Juri was so much better
[2:13:03] <@Menitta> I like Juri in 5 more but thats just me
[2:13:05] <%LastHazzerd> combos are not allowed
[2:13:45] <SomersaultJustice> YEYEYE NEOPOP
[2:13:46] <%BusterRepukken> les go
[2:13:52] <+yeknomlive> oh let's go
[2:13:57] <SomersaultJustice> hasn't been updated since 2002
[2:14:10] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Pretty sure that's on Switch too so...that's an option
[2:14:11] <AstrodropGaming> beep
[2:14:24] <SomersaultJustice> I think last blade 1 ngpc is on switch?
[2:14:28] <%Mcmuffin______> is this on switch too?
[2:14:46] <iocook> I've been, and still am, a mostly Nintendo guy, but NeoGeo owners had that good shit.
[2:14:48] <GeltonZ> @Mcmuffin______ Yes
[2:14:52] <@Solidus_113> the 4 lords!
[2:14:54] <SomersaultJustice> hey look, it's the stormblood primal tier Kappa
[2:15:01] <nicversus> look at these yakuza clans
[2:15:02] <@Solidus_113> I know them from FF14 LUL
[2:15:04] <Revzero25> Lol
[2:15:10] <Super_Voltekka> CARDINAL GATE BOYS
[2:15:11] <+yeknomlive> maria from castlevania weapons
[2:15:14] <Evendrag> these are in EVERYTHING
[2:15:17] <Revzero25> Where’s my tiger
[2:15:27] <Super_Voltekka> Now all we need is Kinshinshi
[2:15:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:15:29] <%ChoculaUltra> holy crap this intro is insane for a handheld LUL
[2:15:36] <GeltonZ> @iocook Neo Geo never really competed with Nintendo or SEGA. SNK still released their games on both consoles. Really the Neo Geo was never MEANT for consumer sale.
[2:15:45] <jetjagger222> hey look guilty gear zero Kappa
[2:15:45] <+smoshow21> Oh sick, I didn;t know we were doing both
[2:15:49] <+yeknomlive> decide the destiny
[2:15:53] <%dredgyboi> oh shit i have this on my neo geo pocket!
[2:15:54] <SomersaultJustice> did swery work on this too?
[2:16:00] <+smoshow21> Have you unlocked the characters?
[2:16:03] <%BusterRepukken> i own a Neo Geo AES, still works.
[2:16:04] <jetjagger222> ishiwatari did
[2:16:14] <SomersaultJustice> someone get them a save with everyone unlocked!
[2:16:36] <nicversus> nice BusterRepukken. I went the MVS route because it's a lot cheaper...
[2:16:43] <%Sparkseid> sajamJam
[2:16:53] <nicversus> let's get it on now
[2:16:57] <Super_Voltekka> Pick Eiji's ancestor
[2:17:08] <nicversus> 8-bit Get Into Fighting Games intro when
[2:17:13] <%BusterRepukken> @nicversus Yep, I have 8 AES games and thats quite the price tag.
[2:17:19] <SomersaultJustice> ohh this framerate
[2:17:30] <@Solidus_113> count those frames
[2:17:46] <+nooshy1> Isn't this on the Switch now as well?
[2:17:47] <AstrodropGaming> Oof, little chunky but still funky
[2:17:48] <SomersaultJustice> is frameskip turned off? I remember you had to manually do it in neopop
[2:17:48] <GeltonZ> I think Woolie's emulator is fucking up. I swear this is smoother on real hardware.
[2:17:49] <turbofolk> Man this shit is slow af even the music is chugging
[2:17:50] <nicversus> @BusterRepukken hey at least you're in good shape if you ever need to finance a house :D
[2:17:59] <DingusMcBaseball> @WoolieVersus have you played pocket fighter EX yet? great unity fangame
[2:18:03] <jetjagger222> hah even the climbing baby is there
[2:18:04] <Clundy> that screen shake is so good
[2:18:18] <GeltonZ> Setsuna is definately an unlockable
[2:18:29] <%BusterRepukken> @nicversus Lol yeah. I got KOF 95/96/97/98, Samsho 1/2/4 and Real Bout Fatal Fury Special
[2:18:36] <+smoshow21> He is an unloackable. Most of the LB2 characters are
[2:18:53] <+matteasyplays> Last Blade 3 PLEASE
[2:18:53] <nicversus> The Last Blade demake
[2:19:03] <DaKnightWarrior> I wish...
[2:19:04] <turbofolk> !game
[2:19:05] <SomersaultJustice> Last Blade x Waku Waku 7 x Galaxy Fight
[2:19:19] <+smoshow21> I would love a Last Blade 3
[2:19:22] <+Superbro64> SNK will *have* to make new games after KOF XV
[2:19:27] <jetjagger222> karnov's revenge 2
[2:19:32] <pixel_river> capcom and the other devs dont wanna make lower budget 2d games sadly
[2:19:35] <+Superbro64> Though I personally really want a new metal slug
[2:19:37] <@Solidus_113> Ultra Last Blade 2 The Final Challengers
[2:19:57] <%ChoculaUltra> these intros are so rad
[2:20:07] <nicversus> I want a Metal Slug game but only if the graphics are done by Paul Robertson
[2:20:10] <+matteasyplays> RUGAL monkaS
[2:20:12] <+smoshow21> @Solidus_113 I'd buy the shit out of that
[2:20:17] <SomersaultJustice> IT ALL BEGAN IN 94
[2:20:29] <%venomryu> @WoolieVersus it all began in 94
[2:20:34] <%BusterRepukken> 94 was when I was born so maybe I was fated to be a KOF guy
[2:20:41] <turbofolk> Its a shame no one does sprite shit, theres a lot of new generation sprite artists going to waste
[2:20:41] <+yeknomlive> super babe team
[2:20:46] <%ChoculaUltra> KoF R2 is on the Switch too
[2:21:07] <+matteasyplays> P A I N
[2:21:17] <+Superbro64> Isnt BBTAG a fairly recent sprite fighter with new sprites?
[2:21:25] <+Superbro64> that was at least 2 years ish ago
[2:21:39] <@Solidus_113> the only new sprites in BBTAG are RWBY
[2:21:42] <anarchistPastry> is this supposed to be running at like 10 fps?
[2:21:44] <+Superbro64> there are also plenty of 2d indie fighters, see: Skullgirls
[2:21:49] <GeltonZ> @SuperKirby24 Kinda...most of the sprites are recycled and the new ones are cleaned up pre-rendered cel-shading for the most part.
[2:21:56] <GeltonZ> @anarchistPastry No
[2:22:11] <turbofolk> Skullgirls are not sprites i fucking wish they were
[2:22:11] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus The framerate is your emulator Woolie.
[2:22:12] <SomersaultJustice> woolie, turn off frameskip
[2:22:16] <+IceyCone> RWBY and the solo DLC franchise characters were new but everything else is yeah
[2:22:19] <%Mcmuffin______> would switch version run better
[2:22:26] <%BusterRepukken> the emulator is kinda meh
[2:22:26] <+Superbro64> @solidus_113 heart in bbtag s2 is newish, and I try to forget about yumi too Kappa
[2:22:32] <+Dorf1> the switch emulator runs it fine
[2:22:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:22:34] <SomersaultJustice> @WoolieVersus turn off frameskip
[2:22:49] <+nooshy1> Yeah. I have this on NGPC, it is. LOT smoother.

[2:23:33] <Super_Voltekka> Shingo is voiced by Dio
[2:23:43] <AstrodropGaming> That's much smoother
[2:23:49] <SomersaultJustice> the samsho game was a preorder business for samsho on switch
[2:23:56] <SomersaultJustice> ^bonus
[2:24:24] <GeltonZ> Yup but they released it as a non-preorder later too
[2:24:28] <+nooshy1> Different sprites here. SamSho Pocket and Gal Fighters came out after MoTm.
[2:24:42] <+yeknomlive> pick shiki

[2:25:51] <Tryhardblackguy> @BusterRepukken Sam sho 2019 netplay is wew
[2:26:20] <%BusterRepukken> at least KOF XV wont suffer the same fate
[2:27:11] <turbofolk> That night sky is beautiful
[2:27:44] <+smoshow21> @BusterRepukken Hopefully. I hope we do not get Monkey's pawed and the netcode is SFV level
[2:28:00] <turbofolk> iku
[2:28:06] <+Xero_J> SLASH
[2:28:12] <+Superbro64> they got a year plus to make the netcode work
[2:28:20] <%BusterRepukken> @smoshow21 Itll definitely be better than SFV cause theyve been working on it since early dev cycle as opposed to retrofitting poorly.
[2:28:26] <+Superbro64> no one is stopping them from consulting with code mystics
[2:28:37] <jetjagger222> nakoruru looks like pipimi here
[2:28:38] <+HolyGriddles> @woolieversus how do you feel on Baiken being a possible guest for Samsho?
[2:28:40] <+smoshow21> We shall see.
[2:28:51] <+smoshow21> But I really hope so
[2:28:53] <GeltonZ> Fatal Fury and Gal's Fighter actually run the smoothest.
[2:28:59] <SomersaultJustice> did they play gals fighter already?
[2:29:06] <GeltonZ> @SomersaultJustice Not yet
[2:29:27] <Super_Voltekka> I remember the dude who gets his ass kicked in RB2's intro is a playable character in the handheld FF

[2:30:30] <Darren716> Woolie if it's possible find the SFIV iOS port, it's hilarious
[2:30:35] <GeltonZ> SF2 on Gameboy is overrated trash.
[2:30:35] <SomersaultJustice> I had SF2 for Game Boy original, now THAT's a bad port
[2:30:39] <+nooshy1> KoF 96 GB is a whole mood
[2:30:45] <+Superbro64> in 3ds sfiv you can walk forward and do sonic booms

[2:31:55] <GeltonZ> Power Quest is SO good.
[2:32:19] <SomersaultJustice> would like to see a co op Metamoqester run at some point
[2:32:26] <+Manjoume> MK Unchained was a decent port of deception. whether or not deception is good is another matter
[2:32:43] <DaKnightWarrior> Raging Fighter on the gba. There's a obscure one for ya.
[2:32:43] <GeltonZ> YES. Beast Wars is good too.
[2:32:45] <+lcl_mayhem_lcl> MK advanced?! @woolieversus
[2:32:55] <+HolyGriddles> Deception is like the best 3D MK
[2:33:05] <@Menitta> It is $8. I bought it today
[2:33:05] <+HolyGriddles> The story mode was amazing
[2:33:09] <@Solidus_113> if that last SFV character is a crossover...
[2:33:12] <@Solidus_113> the hope grows
[2:33:13] <+Superbro64> a cvs2 port will also be nice
