[0:28:11] <Jerp> actually the game audio does sound a little muddy. I don't remember it sounding like this when I played it
[0:28:12] <QueequegTheater> It's a zone
[0:28:15] <DickieWoodsmall_279> some of my homies hate the cum zone, others are less trepidatious about it

[0:31:00] <%MyNameIsRasus> it's not what you heard, it's what you hearin' listen
[0:31:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Might need to change that option in the console system

[0:49:46] <zhenthrim213> these are what grappler players look like after years
[0:49:51] <buerdo> @woolie they're here for your gland
[0:50:02] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I feel like I can really relate to a creature obsessed with glands
[0:50:08] <%MyNameIsRasus> i hate when games think damage sponges are a good way to increase difficulty.

[0:51:54] <DickieWoodsmall_279> this area has moist overtones
[0:52:02] <%Onorekian> picking up the gland changes the world slightly
[0:52:04] <+skyshinecrusader> gotta get hard
[0:52:19] <HarshNerf> the gland excretes

[0:54:51] <+InvaderSnarf> This combat looks really fluid and much faster than a lot of other souls like games
[0:54:53] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I remember the taurus demons guarding the chaos flame looking like something I'd make in an age of empires level editor when I was 9
[0:55:08] <%MajorCrasher> lol

[0:56:55] <+ArtemisCroc> it's negative stamina, dark souls has negative stamina as well
[0:57:04] <brunoberserk> the game needs a chloranthy ring equivalent LUL
[0:57:06] <Justlaxy> He loves defense though right?
[0:57:09] <HarshNerf> low stamina characters do be having low stamina

[1:16:34] <+OrangeMDT> I think at least one chest has quenching acid
[1:16:36] <+SouLucha> There's less than you expect and only in this area.
[1:16:42] <Justlaxy> I wanna see how long he can go with this little stam. sfhLISTEN
[1:16:51] <%Pillagius> let's see if Woolie remembers how to get to the obsidian tower
[1:16:54] <DSD24> So has Woolie settled on Hammer Chisel?
[1:17:02] <Treasure_Vault> A quenching acid in the fog is worth it, unless it takes an hour and a half to find.

[1:26:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> Chat can you believe Citizen Kane came out 80 years ago?
[1:26:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:26:24] <%Onorekian> it really all looks the same, the swamp needs a little more
[1:26:27] <%dds333a> They're one major boss in, although I'm not sure if they took another one out
[1:26:29] <%Pillagius> @Digsby I think Woolie finished at least 1 or 2 major areas, out of 4.
[1:26:30] <HelghastTroop> @ReallyBigRocks its that old and i still havent seen it
[1:26:51] <%Onorekian> whats up gorf
[1:26:52] <%Onorekian> you do you
[1:26:53] <+JingKaisean> Mortal Souls huh?
[1:26:57] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I can't believe the cold war was 40 years ago so nostalgic
[1:26:59] <Digsby> I was hoping they were still at the start. I refunded this game for being eye strainingly horrible to navigate within an hour of buying it. I'd hate to think you're STILL in this swamp after a few hours.
[1:27:00] <brunoberserk> GAMABUNTA

[1:28:56] <%dds333a> @deekman once before death
[1:29:01] <%Pillagius> I like the rogue-type shell. Especially part where he heals from poison
[1:29:08] <%dds333a> at default
[1:29:08] <buerdo> @woolieversus I just realized the command grab eats soft glimpses
[1:29:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I feel like one of those statues was at the obsidian fortress too
[1:29:19] <+theoldone001> Grisha drops something I think
[1:29:20] <%Deekman> @dds333a if you make it back into your shell next time instead of getting knocked out you just die?
[1:29:25] <%Onorekian> @buerdo oh wow nice eye
[1:29:27] <%dds333a> exactly
[1:29:28] <Digsby> Did Woolie just see 3 guys running in a line and think "Wow that guy is fast"?
[1:29:45] <%Deekman> lol
[1:29:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Digsby "that was just my afterimage"

[1:37:27] <%RyTYoung> @holydeviant1 it's a really good animation, only saw it when I went back to the game last week!
[1:37:38] <%Onorekian> not even close
[1:37:40] <Razeino> If only the cats eyes moved. It looks like a toy.
[1:37:41] <HelghastTroop> i need a rare animation play out where the cat dont want it and just swats at your hand like crazy
[1:37:44] <DSD24> More Cowbell
[1:37:47] <JairusHopesItWorks> you can max the hammer from him
[1:37:48] <+SouLucha> It's worth it

[1:38:20] <%atlasdotwav> Life is suffering
[1:38:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> just grind off-screen Kappa
[1:38:22] <DickieWoodsmall_279> an animation where the cat lets you pet it twice and then loses its fucking mind to violence
[1:38:32] <%RyTYoung> Do you need resolve for the parry to heal you?
[1:38:38] <Estuko> @HelghastTroop I want it to be where the cat lies on its back and there's an extra optional input to go for the pet and risk getting your hand bit from the bear trap that is the cat belly rub
[1:38:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> @RyTYoung yes
[1:38:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> @RyTYoung you can parry any time, but the riposte costs resolve. Parrying also gives resolve.
[1:39:05] <%dds333a> heading into the deep wood
[1:39:05] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Estuko they show you their belly because they trust you NOT to touch it

[2:04:56] <@Moobot> @dds333a 2445 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:04:58] <DSD24> Man stabbing someone with a mace is brutal

[2:05:01] <%Onorekian> damn dat range
[2:05:07] <leomuratore> It lingers

[2:06:58] <+Errickfoxy> I never really tried out the hammer and chisel as much as I should have
[2:07:01] <+OrangeMDT> ? The shell was right there, but ok
[2:07:11] <+SouLucha> There's an item that switches your weapon.
[2:07:43] <%MyNameIsRasus> @SouLucha i assume that's what he meany by "otherwise you have to spend"
[2:07:56] <+SouLucha> The item is unlimited use.
[2:08:00] <%MyNameIsRasus> oh
[2:08:01] <+Errickfoxy> You can find an item corresponding to each weapon that lets you summon it

[2:10:31] <%MyNameIsRasus> it does sound like nimrod
[2:10:41] <Darkdrill> what is a nimrod?
[2:10:58] <%atlasdotwav> The last of the indecipherable OGs
[2:11:03] <%dds333a> Nimrod is an individual

[2:11:55] <Maids4lyfe> foundery stone
[2:11:58] <Darkdrill> does the stone have lore?
[2:12:09] <+Bosni9> I think the stone is used to upgrade the mace
[2:12:09] <Treasure_Vault> Bugs Bunny called Elmer Fudd Nimrod, the same way you'd call an idiot Einstein. People now think a nimrod is a bad hunter.
[2:12:09] <Maids4lyfe> it's for the mace
[2:12:20] <Treasure_Vault> or an idiot
[2:12:27] <%Onorekian> weird that the [ALL] tab doesn't include key items

[2:24:42] <%dds333a> Seal left LUL
[2:24:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> Parry was like "peace out"
[2:24:49] <MrEli111> @woolieversus  it's happened to be me a few times and it stops rolling too.
[2:24:56] <+SouLucha> Guess he's locking in the hammer...
[2:25:12] <Darkdrill> darksouls might have some rough edges but at least the buttons work LUL
[2:25:14] <+magiraptor> yeah hard locked now
[2:25:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> There's 2 quenching acid back at the merchant, so yeah, you have plenty to upgrade the Hammer AND Mace
[2:25:20] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> farm them shrooms
[2:25:26] <%dds333a> woolieSMUG
[2:25:42] <a_mad_dragon_> bug? sounds more like a challenge to me SoonerLater
[2:25:45] <%dds333a> MOERO
[2:25:56] <%atlasdotwav> Sounds like the git gud bug
[2:25:58] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:25:59] <+Errickfoxy> I know I managed to fully upgrade two weapons on my first pass, not sure how many you can if you find all the acid
[2:25:59] <BlackermanZX> behold my FIRE STICK
[2:26:00] <derap41> game over best weapons gained
[2:26:00] <+TopTieramisu> YOTE
[2:26:01] <MrEli111> @woolieversus running animation too, that one looks funny.
[2:26:03] <Lagseene_> YEEET
[2:26:04] <%Valask> Pog
[2:26:04] <+FataltheBaptist> How come they didn't fix this bug yet?

[2:26:12] <iamacow_mou> !uptime
[2:26:13] <@Moobot> @iamacow_mou WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 42 minutes
[2:26:15] <%Onorekian> the dev team size apparently changed between 4 and 50 depending on when you looked at their production
[2:26:19] <%atlasdotwav> So cool
[2:26:22] <%mr_sups> WHAT WAS THAT
[2:26:26] <brunoberserk> ok NOW you do the billiy kane super GlitchLit
[2:26:28] <%mr_sups> THAT LOOKED SICK

[2:27:10] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> smash dat shield
[2:27:12] <%dds333a> he comes correct
[2:27:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> What are the actual bug classes/their meanings? I keep hearing Woolie mention A/B/C bugs but I can't find anything helpful online
[2:27:19] <+OrangeMDT> XD
[2:28:10] <%robosqueeb> what if the balls got hard too
[2:28:14] <%dds333a> iron will
[2:28:19] <%Valask> This screen looks like it's from Darksiders
[2:28:31] <%holydeviant1> @ThomasOfTroy C is mild and mostly looks bad, B is gameplay affecting, A is hard crashes and file-ruining
[2:28:43] <%Tenchi_G> Hope they got this for free with PS+
[2:28:45] <+mace210> whose voice does this remind me of?
[2:29:04] <+SouLucha> @Tenchi_G that's how I played it
[2:29:07] <%dds333a> stands to reason LUL
[2:29:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> @holydeviant1 Ahhh, okay. Thank you!
[2:29:16] <%atlasdotwav> @thomasoftroy It's the degree too which this bug stops you from being able to complete/play the game
[2:29:22] <%Deasmeister> Why did it not work this time I wonder
[2:29:28] <%dds333a> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[2:29:28] <+Marco1877> Ur character got the same stamina i got right now
[2:29:46] <%Valask> That is a bizarre idle animation
[2:29:52] <%Deasmeister> Biggest boi
[2:29:54] <%Tenchi_G> @soulucha This is probably the pc version tho LUL
[2:29:54] <%holydeviant1> @Valask he's really twitchy!
[2:30:22] <%Valask> oh look it's SMT law endings
[2:30:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:30:41] <+SouLucha> @Tenchi_G I got the parry bug at least twice in my run
[2:30:44] <%Onorekian> yup
[2:30:46] <%dds333a> @valask Gotta get that shit up and running
[2:31:01] <+mace210> IT SOUNDS LIKE THE OLD BEAR GUY FROM GAME OF THRONES PogChamp wonder if its the same actor
[2:31:02] <+magiraptor> dots connected
[2:31:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, you almost have Edrim maxed out, so who's gonna be your secondary shell?
[2:31:49] <%dds333a> @cappuccinoguil Kappa
[2:31:51] <%Tenchi_G> @soulucha Haven't started yet, my backlog is so big
[2:31:57] <%Onorekian> yay the parry works
[2:32:05] <%Valask> good god the camera looks like it's both better and worse than Dark Souls somehow
[2:32:21] <+mace210> LUL
[2:32:24] <%holydeviant1> @Valask Did you catch the Tarantino Cam glitch earlier?
[2:32:25] <+SouLucha> @Tenchi_G It's not the biggest game, finished it in 3-4 sittings
[2:32:37] <%Valask> nope @holydeviant1
[2:32:40] <monster_craft23> i always thought this game was designed to make a good trailer but not necessarily a good game
[2:32:48] <monster_craft23> very cinematic
[2:33:06] <%holydeviant1> @Valask A bit of geometry forced the cam directly under the floor and fastened to the player's ass
[2:33:18] <%dds333a> the same song and dance LUL
[2:33:20] <%Valask> sick!
[2:33:38] <%atlasdotwav> I love the casual walk of those guys
[2:33:49] <+SouLucha> Woolz sure likes his parry, I barely used it without the incentive of healing
[2:33:51] <DickieWoodsmall_279> is throat slashed top 10 scariest ways to die?
[2:34:13] <%dds333a> @dickiewoodsmall_279 it's a bad one
[2:34:16] <%Valask> @DickieWoodsmall_279 I can think of many worse ways
[2:34:36] <%Valask> getting gulf clubed is one
[2:34:36] <%mr_sups> IN THE FIRST AGE
[2:34:44] <%holydeviant1> IN THE FIRST AGE, SHIT WAS LOCKED
[2:34:44] <%Valask> golf even
[2:34:44] <Daxalog> Lukemia + Torn off nails
[2:35:00] <%Onorekian> the lock is jammed, cannot open the door
[2:35:01] <spaghettiweaver> just tuned in and never saw anything mortal shell before, but damn does this look like a copy of darksouls 3
[2:35:03] <DickieWoodsmall_279> but imagine you try to inhale and it comes out your neck and you just get lungfuls of blood instead
[2:35:43] <%atlasdotwav> Vikings used to pull people's lungs out the back though that's scary
[2:35:50] <%dds333a> @daxalog would tearing off nails indide enough shock to kill? it would hurt, but the victim would live, which is why it's used as torture
[2:35:51] <topiodonk> i gotta try this game again, for some reason It didnt click for me
[2:35:52] <%Valask> oh he just did a dark souls pvp move
[2:36:00] <%atlasdotwav> Imagine you go to breathe but instead it's...the back
[2:36:09] <%dds333a> Only if you left it like that, then yeah, infection would do it
[2:36:19] <Daxalog> Thats wha the lukemia is for. So you bleed out while your feet and finger tips hurt
[2:36:23] <%Onorekian> it could be a bug that disables parry for no reason
[2:36:25] <DickieWoodsmall_279> if you submerge yourself in freezing water too long your fingernails start coming off
[2:36:29] <%dds333a> @daxalog LUL LUL LUL
[2:36:37] <%Valask> Chat monkaS
[2:37:08] <%dds333a> @valask you brought it up
[2:37:19] <%Valask> wait how
[2:37:21] <+Mtome> I stop looking at chat for like 5 seconds and y'all are talking about torture and shit.

[2:50:14] <+SouLucha> stoning is good
[2:50:16] <DickieWoodsmall_279> we should all focus on that
[2:51:00] <buerdo> was that barrel on fire or was that an item?

[2:54:29] <Darkdrill> try it :)
[2:54:30] <%livlinn> LUL
[2:54:31] <%Onorekian> did woolie suddenly get the urge to swing at her?
[2:54:35] <brunoberserk> oh boy
[2:54:39] <%Deasmeister> My problem with the lore in this game is that characters and signs say a lot of nothing
[2:54:51] <%dds333a> @darkdrill exactly my thoughts, it's what I always do
[2:54:55] <+Jiggisnipe> beginning of session on the Sester room, he got ambushed LUL
[2:55:00] <+Jiggisnipe> in*
[2:55:01] <Treasure_Vault> @Deasmeister Ahh yes, you've played Dark Souls, perchance? *snickers*
[2:55:13] <Treasure_Vault> X1000
[2:55:27] <%hax_metatron> @Treasure_Vault I know that's a meme but Dark Souls dialogue / text is 34973857383538753875 times better than this shit LUL
[2:55:41] <oda_flobunaga> Does Woolie have assess to the DLC?
[2:55:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> You got a mask too?
[2:55:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @hax_metatron and actually tells you shit
[2:55:47] <+TheAmazingNick> Offering to the church of the parry
[2:55:50] <+SouLucha> has Woolie played her a tune?
[2:56:04] <DickieWoodsmall_279> another dark souls player? why hello fellow genius, I can see you are a man of culture as well
[2:56:21] <Treasure_Vault> Dark Souls dialogue is cryptic but usually means something and doesn't feel pointless.
[2:56:24] <%hax_metatron> So the scrubs in this level are just reskinned versions of the scrubs in the forest?
[2:56:42] <%dds333a> woolieKICKDAD
[2:56:44] <%Deasmeister> @treasure_vault I feel in DS and bloodborne the lore you get is interesting if minimal here it's just kinda ehh
[2:56:50] <%hax_metatron> I do like the knights in this level though, cool ass design

[2:58:16] <+TheAmazingNick> @strakillias blood for the blood dood
[2:58:21] <+SouLucha> it's best to watch this enemy for awhile and learn his move set, cause he SUCKS
[2:58:27] <%dds333a> @strakillias Khornate motherfuckers out here
[2:59:18] <Treasure_Vault> Dark Souls NPCs have character to their dialogue too. Everyone here seems to love sniffing their own farts.
[2:59:25] <DSD24> Reaction Speed is low tho
[2:59:25] <%dds333a> does he Kappa
[2:59:37] <DickieWoodsmall_279> especially that one guy sho's whole thing is sniffing
[2:59:40] <%Onorekian> the squad
[2:59:55] <+theoldone001> Sparta kick him off the bridge?

[2:59:58] <brunoberserk> this feels like a huge trap
[3:00:37] <%dds333a> Power THROUGH
[3:00:41] <Treasure_Vault> This whole game feels like Ashen, but Ashen had an excellent firelink shrine.
[3:00:49] <QueequegTheater> monkaS

[3:03:52] <Treasure_Vault> Did anyone else play Ashen? The Co-op was excellently planned. You and your buddy just have to kill the boss once together, instead of once in each world.
[3:03:54] <oda_flobunaga> jank Jank Jank a jankitty jank
[3:04:00] <DSD24> I'll fight you on your own level COME ON
[3:04:07] <LunarRemix> Those dual wielding knights moveset is so modern compared to everyone fighting with regular swords
[3:04:11] <%dds333a> Swanging
[3:04:20] <LunarRemix> It feels like it belongs on a Star Wars game instead

[3:05:04] <+SouLucha> they get worse later on too
[3:05:11] <DSD24> @Treasure_Vault Ashen was vary comfy I liked making the village better
[3:05:18] <+SouLucha> learning their shit is a must cause the trades aren't worth it
[3:05:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Treasure_Vault by far my favorite souls-like. Didn't know I needed "souls but with hope" that much in my life
[3:05:52] <DSD24> Is the Mortal Shell gonna drink Lava to fight a boss or something
[3:05:58] <%holydeviant1> "Most of our lighting is molten slag" is certainly an aesthetic
[3:06:15] <DSD24> I'm not into this
[3:06:17] <+TheAmazingNick> Fun fact the character actually broke his toe when kicking that chest, they kept the animation in
[3:06:19] <Dr_Mooose> kinky
[3:06:25] <Treasure_Vault> @Treasure_Vault Hope is nice! It's good to play a dark souls where things get better.

[3:10:43] <Treasure_Vault> 14 person dev team made this in a cave, with a box of scraps
[3:10:44] <QueequegTheater> It was made by two small children in a cave

[3:10:50] <buerdo> they're already respawned anyway

[3:11:27] <%dds333a> @hax_metatron nah, it's fine LUL
[3:11:32] <+warlockwithapixie> interesting
[3:11:39] <leomuratore> Waddaya buying?!
[3:11:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> lmao
[3:11:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so like a way of storing it?
[3:11:57] <Treasure_Vault> Turn soft into hard?
[3:11:58] <%hax_metatron> @dds333a Bruh I'm realizing I had so many bugs in my playthrough now. I just assumed it's the weirdness of the game mechanics
[3:11:59] <%Onorekian> i guess to use the glimpses for other shells?
[3:12:00] <+Errickfoxy> That's so you can use glimpses from your maxed char to use on your others
[3:12:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL ?
[3:12:01] <+warlockwithapixie> What?!
[3:12:02] <+SouLucha> It's cause the shells don't share glimpses
[3:12:03] <scrumbotime> If you buy glimpses, you can pop them on ANOTHER shell
[3:12:04] <DickieWoodsmall_279> turn soft into hard to make it un-losable
[3:12:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> like your gold in sekiro
[3:12:08] <Treasure_Vault> You got too many soft? Or move to other shells.
[3:12:10] <+Errickfoxy> I think
[3:12:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus glimpses are SHELL specific, so you can turn this into a pocket glimpse to use in another shell
[3:12:16] <Reborn2killu> its to trade to other shells
[3:12:18] <QueequegTheater> Sister converts my soft into hard
[3:12:20] <Eyeflyer> I think it's so you can convert glimpses from one shell to another.
[3:12:20] <+OrangeMDT> To transfer to other shells
[3:12:21] <+warlockwithapixie> OHH
[3:12:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil oh shit that's rad
[3:12:31] <Eyeflyer> @Reborn2killu Exactly.
[3:12:34] <Treasure_Vault> @QueequegTheater nice
[3:12:42] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @QueequegTheater don't say that
[3:12:42] <+warlockwithapixie> dat makes sense
[3:13:02] <%dds333a> @dickiewoodsmall_279 name checks out
[3:13:05] <Razeino> That shall is pretty twitchy

[3:13:30] <%Deasmeister> Bold hunter mark
[3:13:39] <%hax_metatron> @WoolieVersus It also gives you resolve on familiarity, along with sending you back to her. Kind of useless for wasting glimpses on it IMO

[4:17:02] <+Awkward_Cyborg> that's a railgun
[4:17:03] <%holydeviant1> "Now that's a kabedon!"
[4:17:08] <+SouLucha> It costs 800 to fire this gun once...
[4:17:09] <+Catpurnicus> predator spear
[4:17:10] <scrumbotime> That's a kabeGONE
[4:17:11] <Tempmael> did that nail her to the wall? LUL
[4:17:20] <+Proxzo> I walk away for 10 minutes and come back to cybertron
[4:17:25] <QueequegTheater> I changed my mind this game is awesome
[4:17:28] <%RyTYoung> YO
[4:17:31] <oda_flobunaga> For the cost of those bolts it better be fucking worth it
[4:17:31] <definitelynotjayy> would be disappointing if a Balistazooka did anything less tbh
[4:17:32] <AganAOM> whatever it costs
[4:17:35] <AganAOM> it's worth it

[4:18:40] <%doomunderthestairs> m
[4:18:43] <+Proxzo> @dds333a It costs 200,000 tar to fire this gun for FIVE SECONDS.
[4:18:45] <%Indigo_Automaton> Will the Ballistazooka pierce multiple enemies?
[4:18:45] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:18:46] <+Felhad> Is there some kind of build reason why Woolie isn't using Hardening much?
[4:18:59] <Dakuu75> @proxzo Lol
[4:19:09] <oda_flobunaga> this level has crevices
[4:19:12] <Treasure_Vault> @Felhad shares CD with parry, i think?
[4:19:14] <TheeRabbi> woolie calling the devs dumb
[4:19:18] <%Pillagius> now you're thinking with portals
[4:19:18] <scrumbotime> Shelleport
[4:19:26] <+SouLucha> this level has lots of crevices...
[4:19:52] <%hax_metatron> @Indigo_Automaton YES, also groups.
[4:19:59] <%Indigo_Automaton> Sick
[4:20:01] <+Proxzo> I missed it but how much does a bullet for that gun cost?
[4:20:08] <%ChoculaUltra> 800
[4:20:11] <%hax_metatron> The Ballistazooka really shows its power when you have 3-4 enemies running at you
[4:20:12] <+Felhad> I don't think it should, but I only played a couple hours
[4:20:13] <+Proxzo> Yowza
[4:20:16] <%dds333a> 800 each
[4:20:18] <TheeRabbi> what's up with the fart gas every time an enemy dies. it's an ugly effect
[4:20:18] <+Proxzo> Lady in REeeeed
[4:20:21] <+OrangeMDT> Lot of crevices with nothing in them

[4:20:43] <+TheAmazingNick> Poked with the head of a hammer
[4:20:46] <oda_flobunaga> there are some cavey things in this level with plenty of stuff if you find them
[4:20:55] <%RyTYoung> Has anyone here played through Hellpoint and can say if it's worth trying?
[4:20:58] <+Catpurnicus> it costs 400k to fire this weapon for 12 seconds
[4:21:24] <+TheAmazingNick> @Catpurnicus DMC5?
[4:21:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @theamazingnick TF2
[4:21:51] <%agianttornado> @RyTYoung I am someone who got miffed at MS because it took away from hellpoitmn
[4:21:57] <%dds333a> reggie underselling LUL
[4:21:58] <TheeRabbi> hellpoint is worth trying of it's a good sale. pretty fun game
[4:22:07] <+TheAmazingNick> @RyTYoung It has a very Warhammer 40k grim feel which is nice, I would absolutely try it for the prices that it goes for on steam
[4:22:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> damn Woolie is kinda destroying these guys
[4:22:18] <+Proxzo> Woolie has just enough to buy 1 BOOLET
[4:22:26] <+Catpurnicus> this reminds me I need to play more returnal now that its fixed
[4:22:31] <%agianttornado> @RyTYoung Its envirenmental storytelling is godlike, for real
[4:22:32] <+Felhad> The Hammer and Chisel is insane
[4:22:37] <%dds333a> @proxzo and he CANNOT outsmart it
[4:22:38] <oda_flobunaga> @RyTYoung I got to the final boss of Hellpoint, but lost interest because an alot of the bosses are really simplistic even though the environment does the DS1 thing
[4:22:42] <%RyTYoung> @agianttornado that's weird, the setting looks cool
[4:22:46] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:22:46] <Treasure_Vault> Twist?
[4:22:48] <%ChoculaUltra> monkaS
[4:22:50] <randomahole> ???
[4:22:51] <+SouLucha> Never tried the hammer & chisel on my one run, seems legit
[4:22:51] <Treasure_Vault> lol
[4:22:53] <+warlockwithapixie> ?
[4:22:55] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[4:22:57] <+notgoodatnamessorry> Hellpoint has great map design and a cool setting, but the combat and enemy variety is just so disappointing
[4:23:01] <KeiganOfAstora> Just tuning in for the first time. This looks mental
[4:23:02] <Treasure_Vault> why'd you touch our lever, they ask
[4:23:08] <sweetestbeefs> who put these dementors in my soulslike
[4:23:09] <%ChoculaUltra> the stone sword pillars look p rad
[4:23:12] <%dds333a> not ice, stone
[4:23:14] <KeiganOfAstora> Where are they adn what is the "objective"?
[4:23:20] <%holydeviant1> Fire, earth, water (ice?)

[4:23:27] <+Mrbaconator> a stone ocean
[4:23:36] <%ChoculaUltra> @KeiganOfAstora ya know I couldn't honestly tell you anymore
[4:23:38] <%RyTYoung> id be getting it on console and I read it was apparently glitchy at launch
[4:23:43] <+TheAmazingNick> "on rock and stone"
[4:23:45] <%dds333a> @mrbaconator gotta breal out of it
[4:23:50] <oda_flobunaga> @KeiganOfAstora the objective is to go up
[4:23:53] <%agianttornado> @RyTYoung everyone was talking about MortalShell because it has AAA environments and graphics, Hellpoint is still beautiful just more "indy"
[4:23:54] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus if you like this you'd love Control
[4:23:58] <%dds333a> *break
[4:24:01] <@Solidus_113> yeah it's Control
[4:24:13] <+Felhad> Theyre in rock land and need to get glands for bondage giant
[4:24:18] <%dds333a> @deekman he's played it, or at least owns it
[4:24:18] <Estwilde> This place looks crazy cool
[4:24:25] <%Deekman> @dds333a oh nice
[4:24:42] <foghornleghorn55> I haven't played the game but honestly the forest looks more visually interesting to me than this place. It looks too samey.
[4:24:48] <+OrangeMDT> Scrap isn’t worth it here
[4:25:03] <%RyTYoung> @agianttornado I picked up Ashen because of the setting and dark souls like gameplay but it didn't jive with me

[4:25:04] <%dds333a> getting popped
[4:25:18] <Dakuu75> HOLD L3 to sprint? Ew.
[4:25:32] <%ChoculaUltra> this place "feels" like that second to last zone in a JRPG kind of vibe
[4:25:33] <%hax_metatron> This area is the best part of the game for sure, and gets better later
[4:25:47] <%hax_metatron> They really put all their budget on this one
[4:26:06] <leomuratore> Snipe!
[4:26:11] <%dds333a> @choculaultra well, this area leads more towards endgame to my knowledge
[4:26:15] <%agianttornado> @RyTYoung rise from the ashes? yeah i got it for free from epic but couldnt be arsed to load it up
[4:26:23] <%ChoculaUltra> oh that makes sense then LUL @dds333a

[4:26:42] <%ChoculaUltra> DO IT
[4:26:44] <Estwilde> That is an intense reload animation
[4:26:48] <Estuko> that reload is money

[4:28:18] <Bonebagmel> RENT IS DUE
[4:28:25] <oda_flobunaga> Stacks gone
[4:28:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's the last upgrade on the shell
[4:28:32] <KeiganOfAstora> Wait, that's how you heal?
[4:28:34] <leomuratore> DAMN
[4:28:34] <AganAOM> tf2 giblets

[4:28:35] <Treasure_Vault> pop

[4:28:44] <a_mad_dragon_> B L O O D Y M I S T
[4:28:46] <leomuratore> @KeiganOfAstora or with consumables.
[4:28:49] <%dds333a> @keiganofastora no, but it's one of the methods
[4:28:51] <NeroInfinite> BOOM
[4:28:58] <%agianttornado> @KeiganOfAstora you get two "lives"
[4:29:06] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[4:29:25] <TheeRabbi> unlike DS, this just feels... like a weird arena beta. it just feels like open, empty spaces with enemies scattered about. hard to immerse when there's barely any scenery anywhere.
[4:29:25] <%dds333a> Healing can be done through parrying, consumables, and returning to the shell after the "first chance death" restores health
[4:29:31] <+SouLucha> Shells Die Twice
[4:29:48] <sweetestbeefs> can you only heal by getting back in the shell once?
[4:29:53] <%dds333a> In fact, there's an item that essentially kills the player so that they run back to the shell for the heal
[4:30:02] <%whyskeywolfe> whyskeywolfe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Holy crap Reggie you look like you reverted to an earlier save file. You chopped half a decade off your face! Do you want some ribbon candy young man? Maybe some sodie pop? Anyway Woolie you're looking allright.
[4:30:07] <BlackermanZX> oh he will want that acid anyways
[4:30:08] <%dds333a> Yes, the second time health is depleted, it's just death
[4:30:11] <%Ashenik1> should Reggie play Dark Souls 2 or straight up jump to DS3?
[4:30:29] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:30:32] <Dakuu75> @ashenik1 Ds3 imo
[4:30:33] <%agianttornado> thats a big question
[4:30:38] <Treasure_Vault> No reason to skip DS2 your first time through
[4:30:39] <+Felhad> DS2 for sure
[4:30:51] <Janzer_> ds2 can be forgotten, its best
[4:30:56] <Maids4lyfe> parry window seems almost impossible
[4:31:01] <+SouLucha> We all must suffer through Ds2 at least once.
[4:31:04] <Treasure_Vault> You need to know what ds2 tried to do, and how it didn't
[4:31:09] <%agianttornado> DS2 isnt an OMG SKIP IT IT SUCKS kinda sequel, its still a DS game\
[4:31:11] <+TheAmazingNick> @Ashenik1 no reason to skip games. Going back to DS2 can be rough it is next for him
[4:31:13] <xerotwo> LUL
[4:31:14] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[4:31:16] <%Indigo_Automaton> D:
[4:31:19] <%holydeviant1> DS2 isn't that fucking bad, stop overselling it. It's fine.
[4:31:27] <Treasure_Vault> As the worst dark souls game, DS2 is ONLY an 8.6/10
[4:31:29] <sweetestbeefs> DS2 is a fun game, no reason to skip it
[4:31:30] <%dds333a> @theerabbi this is more this one zone, specifically, but yeah
[4:31:44] <Maids4lyfe> @holydeviant1 exactly
[4:31:47] <sweetestbeefs> worst souls game, yeah, but it's still a fun game
[4:31:50] <bujiraso> i just picked up DS2 . The defenders are right: it's fine
[4:31:54] <+notgoodatnamessorry> honestly, every time I go back to play DS2, I end up enjoying it more than I remembered
[4:31:58] <+Felhad> DS2 has Power Stance, therefore its worth playing
[4:32:00] <%holydeviant1> Like, yeah, it's not the second coming of god damn christ but good god
[4:32:00] <Treasure_Vault> I like my 8.6/10s
[4:32:01] <+eanscrale> I hate DS2, but it's not DMC2 it's still worth a playthrough.
[4:32:01] <QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 Why the hell would he skip the bes tone
[4:32:06] <%agianttornado> yeah if ds1 is fave and its a 9, then 3 is an 8.5 and 2 is an 8
[4:32:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1478257606875815940?t=yjLm7ZYgulpaxSOSAEFNpA&s=19
[4:32:07] <+MajesticDoogle> ds2 is the best souls game actually
[4:32:28] <+TheAmazingNick> Alright lets not get crazyx
[4:32:28] <QueequegTheater> ^
[4:32:32] <%SirGO0SE> i like her walk cycle
[4:32:38] <bujiraso> the chat pauses to collect their thoughts lol
[4:32:39] <%SirGO0SE> she got dem hips
[4:32:42] <@Solidus_113> adaptability is dumb
[4:32:51] <+eanscrale> it is very dumb
[4:32:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I showed you my rune please get parried
[4:33:01] <%agianttornado> ive been playing it and DS2 is the only one that leaves me with too many build options
[4:33:04] <QueequegTheater> @Solidus_113 Yes. DS2 is still the best Souls game
[4:33:09] <+eanscrale> but is it worse than soul memory?
[4:33:13] <%dds333a> DS2 is lower than an 8.5 for me, it's more of a seven
[4:33:14] <+mace210> COME AT ME BRO
[4:33:19] <athuramn> chat just loves hot takes
[4:33:25] <%agianttornado> theres an item to control soul memory
[4:33:30] <%holydeviant1> If you wnt the goddamn iframes, you PAY FOR THE GODDAMN IFRAMES
[4:33:33] <QueequegTheater> Reminder that DS2 had a better metacritic than DS1
[4:33:42] <KeiganOfAstora> Metacritic is meaningless
[4:33:46] <QueequegTheater> The hate is overblown, most people really liked it
[4:33:56] <%RyTYoung> She be schmoovin
[4:34:05] <sweetestbeefs> adaptability is stupid but I feel like the game gives you enough to get to around 16 adp and then you can just do whatever
[4:34:05] <KeiganOfAstora> It was just "different"
[4:34:08] <+TheAmazingNick> Cause games journalists are really the authority on these types of games.
[4:34:10] <oda_flobunaga> Immortal Unchained is best souls Eva
[4:34:11] <%Ashenik1> DS2 is really good in its DLCs. Vanilla most of the time is quite meh.
[4:34:18] <KeiganOfAstora> Scholar is nice
[4:34:20] <0078thunder> metacritic, the pinnacle of review sites
[4:34:22] <Treasure_Vault> DS2 tried all sorts of things. I respect that.
[4:34:23] <Dakuu75> Skip ds2 and ds3, go straight to Elden Ring
[4:34:32] <+SouLucha> Sure let
[4:34:39] <%agianttornado> ^^
[4:34:40] <+Felhad> Power Stancing heavy weapons is cool and nothing can take that away
[4:34:44] <casy_fair> ghostbuster
[4:34:49] <+notgoodatnamessorry> I agree DS2 is overhated, but it's still not my favorite, and certainly not the best
[4:34:51] <buerdo> ghost friendly fired
[4:34:53] <%RyTYoung> I have only gotten about half way through DS 2, the last time I played it was probably around 5-6 years ago
[4:34:53] <%agianttornado> POwer stancing is cool.
[4:35:13] <%dds333a> Skip them both, head to Bloodborne, the undisputed best Souls game
[4:35:16] <+TheAmazingNick> DS2 got twinblades too, they're something. Speedrun weapon too
[4:35:21] <sweetestbeefs> the fact you can swing your weapons left handed is sick, dunno why they never did that in 1 and 3
[4:35:28] <Dakuu75> @dds333a Hell yeah
[4:35:29] <%hax_metatron> @sweetestbeefs It
[4:35:34] <%hax_metatron> It's coming back in Elden Ring
[4:35:37] <+OrangeMDT> Skip DS2 and 3, play Fortnite
[4:35:37] <%agianttornado> DS2 is a little easier to get "lost" in. like "where tf do i go????"
[4:35:37] <QueequegTheater> Most people hating on DS2 are just doing it because the name Miyazaki isn't on the cover, you literally can't convince me otherwise
[4:35:41] <casy_fair> the music i. Madjula holds up well...
[4:35:44] <oda_flobunaga> DS2 has lots of cool mechanical iterations but fighting does not feel as good as previous entries
[4:35:54] <sweetestbeefs> @hax_metatron yo no way. that's fuckin dope
[4:36:07] <%agianttornado> the ds2 fighting demands you go at its pace, for better or not
[4:36:10] <%hax_metatron> @sweetestbeefs Many DS2 mechanics are coming back, including powerstancing
[4:36:17] <QueequegTheater> @hax_metatron Powerstancing too
[4:36:17] <Estuko> @OrangeMDT I fell into the trap of Fortnite with my friends. its too fun sometimes
[4:36:28] <bujiraso> @agianttornado yuuup
[4:36:36] <Treasure_Vault> DS1 has heavy combat, DS3 has agile combat, DS2 combat a little clunky.
[4:36:49] <%agianttornado> but its not bad
[4:36:58] <%agianttornado> but you right
[4:37:01] <bujiraso> yeah
[4:37:03] <+notgoodatnamessorry> it's more than just Miyazaki not being on the game for ds2 is not it's only problem, that game suffered from awful bugs at launch, and it's movement is still pretty janky
[4:37:05] <Josef_Stryker> DS2 feels more like you need to learn crowd control
[4:37:18] <%Ashenik1> DS2 DLC were really fun, but man, most of the areas were bleak
[4:37:19] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:37:20] <Josef_Stryker> Because there's alot of moments where you deal with a bunch of enemies at once if you're not careful
[4:37:24] <%agianttornado> yeah theres no kiting in ds2
[4:37:28] <+OrangeMDT> @estuko almost any game is fun with some friends
[4:37:34] <%hax_metatron> Honestly I love how heavy weapons feel in Mortal Shell; I think DS1 is the game that got heavy weapons right.  This is the only other Souls-like that puts weight into animations that I know of
[4:37:36] <ashthepkmnmaster> boss fights In vanilla ds2 are ass
[4:37:37] <QueequegTheater> I won't disagree that ADP was a huge mistake.  If they got rid of it and just set your agility to 105 it would be so much better than having to burn 10-15 levels at the start
[4:37:37] <+eanscrale> Honestly, if you have to do DS2 I say just go hexer. Nothing will ever be that crazy again.
[4:37:38] <%agianttornado> enemies run a marathon to chase yoy
[4:37:40] <oda_flobunaga> The only time DS2 actually feels good is in the DLCs, whihc means its not the fault of the core mechanics but the fault of the base game's enemy and encounter design
[4:37:44] <HarshNerf> @orangemdt except the game woolie is playing with friends
[4:38:09] <QueequegTheater> wait, you guys have friends?
[4:38:13] <QueequegTheater> How do I get those
[4:38:16] <+OrangeMDT> LUL
[4:38:20] <%agianttornado> only chat friends....
[4:38:20] <Dakuu75> Lol
[4:38:49] <HarshNerf> i have parasocial friends aka ghosts
[4:38:55] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus there actually are caves in this level around some of the edges
[4:39:01] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:39:05] <bujiraso> lol you just pay for them @queequegtheater
[4:39:26] <%ChoculaUltra> I met a steam friend via DS3 multiplayer. Their last login says 5 years ago FeelsBadMan
[4:39:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:39:36] <%dds333a> ouch
[4:39:37] <HarshNerf> @oda_flobunaga he checked corners in the previous area so he'll find them don't worry
[4:39:37] <Fabpsi_> this games looks a little bit empty atm, is this due to the tileset/dungeon they are in or is this "normal"? (btw i do not know this game, only thing i know: souls-like, that's about it)
[4:39:51] <Treasure_Vault> Pay Woolie $5 to stand up in booty shorts and write your name on the whiteboard. That's basically friendship, I understand.
[4:39:51] <slix3431> Beardless Reggie is a different person
[4:39:54] <%ChoculaUltra> holy shit
[4:39:58] <%townzzzzz> wat

[4:40:33] <HarshNerf> that's acceptable jank
[4:40:35] <Fabpsi_> Still interesting arstyle atm, I like it
[4:40:44] <%Ashenik1> those europe games
[4:40:51] <slix3431> Who is this beardless man who looks like Reggie?
[4:40:54] <LunarRemix> Right now the game's looking mighty PS3/4
[4:40:59] <delightmare_> Did Woolie find the DLC?
[4:41:01] <HarshNerf> punished Reggie
[4:41:02] <LunarRemix> Like Shadow of Mordor
[4:41:16] <bujiraso> ok, please sit down before I tell you @slix3431
[4:41:20] <+SouLucha> Oh hey, now is probably the worst time but did anyone ever found fake walls in this?
[4:41:22] <justcallmebobplease> Can you imagine if this game got juiced like Returnal got?  A de-janked, super-polished Mortal Shell would be fantastic.
[4:41:45] <slix3431> @bujiraso Bad news, empathy check
[4:42:04] <bujiraso> you roll a 12
[4:42:10] <oda_flobunaga> the point is to go up
[4:42:15] <%dds333a> out of? LUL
[4:42:21] <bujiraso> ...100
[4:42:25] <slix3431> Hold on I got it on my phone
[4:42:28] <leomuratore> Too much nothing
[4:42:32] <+OrangeMDT> I don’t think anything here even does poison LUL
[4:42:33] <0078thunder> @SouLucha no but theres lore you have to hit walls to activate
[4:42:39] <%dds333a> Empathy Check: FAILURE
[4:42:44] <HarshNerf> mortal shell 2 is probably gonna pop off
[4:42:46] <TheAmazingNick> 7/10 too much rock
[4:42:54] <bujiraso> ahem. IT'S MINH
[4:42:57] <+SouLucha> @0078thunder FFFFFFFF

[4:43:50] <HarshNerf> that rock got extra raytraced
[4:43:50] <bujiraso> i realize i have started something i regret. it's reggie
[4:43:51] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:43:53] <oda_flobunaga> Yup
[4:43:54] <LunarRemix> I still have no idea what's going on in the story. Everything so vague
[4:43:57] <Dakuu75> Write*
[4:44:03] <thaprinnydood> yeah this area is somethin thats for sure
[4:44:12] <delightmare_> wateru dooin step-sester?
[4:44:18] <oda_flobunaga> Who tf knows
[4:44:19] <sweetestbeefs> this area looks so confusing to navigate
[4:44:25] <0078thunder> @SouLucha its really not a big deal, the lore in this game is really vague and still hasn't been figured out by the community
[4:44:30] <bujiraso> @delightmare_  FFFFFFFFFFHUHUHUHHFWHAHAHAHA
[4:44:31] <moonbearbacon> isn't this just black crystal caves?
[4:44:33] <buerdo> teleporter
[4:44:48] <Fabpsi_> are those teleporters? Well then it will get confusing for sure lol
[4:44:50] <dimensaur> it's lost izalith with no dragon butts
[4:44:57] <%holydeviant1> In other games, you'd have a horse or car for this
[4:44:58] <TheAmazingNick> You know it's good writing when nobody figured it out
[4:45:03] <Fabpsi_> god is this a huge room
[4:45:09] <+notgoodatnamessorry> honestly I think this games biggest issue is that some areas are just infuriating to navigt
[4:45:10] <+OrangeMDT> I’m oddly happy Woolie dislikes this zone for the same reason I do
[4:45:29] <leomuratore> put a lot of lore in it then. Or something
[4:45:30] <slix3431> @bujiraso [Empathy: Impossible 17] Failure
[4:45:33] <%dds333a> He was super down for the zone when he started LUL
[4:45:34] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus so if you took all the Dragon buts out of Lost Izalith would it be better?
[4:45:39] <LunarRemix> @dimensaur You're completely right
[4:45:39] <Fabpsi_> mh, maybe ambient music could help the game out
[4:45:39] <+capybruhArt> Should've filled it with lava
[4:45:40] <slix3431> NOOOOOOO REGGIE'S BEAAAAAAAAAARD!
[4:45:46] <+Landedx> I'm sure they'll get slightly more confused when they find all the teleports

[4:45:47] <HarshNerf> but then it feels claustrophobic and stressful. they already did that with ice level
[4:45:48] <bujiraso> i gotta level empathy more, frig
[4:45:55] <%dds333a> @oda_flobunaga nothing could make lost Izalith better
[4:45:56] <+theoldone001> The second part of this is better
[4:46:01] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah
[4:46:12] <+notgoodatnamessorry> what if there was just one dragon butt
[4:46:23] <Dakuu75> I think this was a main landscape in the first Riddick movie
[4:46:44] <HarshNerf> man why can't Riddick just progress the space necromancer storyline Sadge
[4:46:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:46:57] <+OrangeMDT> That move is so disjointed
[4:47:04] <%dds333a> @dakuu75 might as well be LUL
[4:47:16] <+SouLucha> @0078thunder the general theme seems to be with all these cults wanting to escape mortality... That's what I took away at least Still would have been nice to have found at least one.
[4:47:17] <bujiraso> The game is legit
[4:47:20] <moonbearbacon> great aesthetic tho
[4:47:20] <%dds333a> Pitch Black is fantastic, but I didn't like the sequel
[4:47:25] <bujiraso> riddick xbox for goat
[4:47:46] <sweetestbeefs> were we the mortal shell all along?
[4:47:54] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:47:54] <HarshNerf> Riddick 2 is the perfect sequel. lore,world building, power scaling
[4:47:57] <moonbearbacon> chronicles of Riddick was the closest to a dune movie before the dune movie
[4:48:12] <+FataltheBaptist> oh we live in mortal shells
[4:48:18] <%Ashenik1> when it comes to souls likes, I did not expect you could have worse level design than nioh...
[4:48:45] <0078thunder> @SouLucha yeah there are definitely themes for sure. but actual story/lore is a confusing mess and nobody really knows whats happening and why
[4:48:54] <LunarRemix> The Souls hole is a deep one and it's quality only goes down as you play more games
[4:48:58] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:49:06] <sweetestbeefs> this area looks cool at least
[4:49:15] <%townzzzzz> someone is sleeping
[4:49:26] <teefpal> hey another dark souls clone
[4:49:54] <freddyl0c0> troll area, so many big empty spaces lol

[4:50:21] <Treasure_Vault> They're gonna be called Darksoulslikes until someone else knocks it out of the park and they give em a dumb genre name, like walk-and-blocks

[4:57:28] <HarshNerf> remember how much shit kingdom come deliverance got. imagine games journalists faced with a game that glorifies napoleon
[4:57:31] <%dds333a> yep LUL
[4:57:36] <@Solidus_113> bayo too
[4:57:58] <%Ashenik1> Game of Thornes is a medieval fantasy with politics fetish
[4:58:00] <sirrice77> Didn
[4:58:01] <+SouLucha> Missed an item on the bridge..
[4:58:09] <brunoberserk> ok im back , wtf is that in woolie's back ?
[4:58:19] <%dds333a> The Ballistazooka
[4:58:20] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie was so hyped for this place lol
[4:58:23] <Dakuu75> This place is fucking huge
[4:58:32] <sirrice77> Didn't kingdom come deliverance have controversy from having only white people or something?
[4:58:36] <+warlockwithapixie> bit of a slog
[4:58:39] <%dds333a> @jiggisnipe he sure was LUL
[4:58:42] <%holydeviant1> These stairs ARE SO COOOOOOL
[4:58:43] <slix3431> The ground looks neto tho
[4:58:54] <%strakillias> See if you can hit both with balistazooka
[4:59:00] <@Menitta> those stairs are wild
[4:59:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> OTG?!?!?!
[4:59:08] <TheeRabbi> there's like... nothing in this game. it's like a training stage in a fighting game, just massive, empty spaces and some enemies scattered about
[4:59:08] <sweetestbeefs> these stairs look cool but if you fall on them you're dead
[4:59:09] <Estuko> these stairs have broken many ankles
[4:59:10] <Treasure_Vault> tech
[4:59:18] <+Complete_Phased> The physics remind me of Lords of the Fallen
[4:59:36] <%RyTYoung> tech
[4:59:47] <@Menitta> why'd they make the stairs like that lmao
[4:59:47] <HarshNerf> @sirrice77 yup, also the game Devs told journos to go away when they tried to push that angle so got double slammed
[5:00:08] <UncleMcgoo> Stair texture is the coolest part of the whole level
[5:00:49] <%RyTYoung> big boulder time?

[5:02:08] <+Mrbaconator> high voltage
[5:02:32] <%Ashenik1> this game feels like ds2
[5:02:35] <+SouLucha> I think he missed a seal upgrade..
[5:02:48] <0078thunder> @hax_metatron LUL i know. I was like him when i got here amazed by how cool it looked. then the slog happened
[5:02:51] <buerdo> kill stacks
[5:02:54] <leomuratore> This area could have been so much smaller.
[5:03:00] <%Deasmeister> One ghost ambush item I feel theres been like 7
[5:03:06] <huskarl_zap> damage buff
[5:03:19] <+swesterly> i love the art direction and combat mechanics of this game but really hope a sequel addresses level design
[5:03:30] <%RyTYoung> Woolie will figure it out psaUp
[5:03:56] <%dds333a> coming up on the boss
[5:04:05] <+SouLucha> Not really...
[5:04:11] <+theoldone001> Ready for close quarters? Lol
[5:04:19] <+SouLucha> This is quite the big area too.
[5:04:23] <Treasure_Vault> Basically, I hope Mortal Shell 2 learns the right lessons.
[5:04:25] <%dds333a> @soulucha oh no?
[5:04:27] <Dakuu75> Oh dear…

[5:05:01] <Treasure_Vault> Kick em down pits for fun and profit
[5:05:20] <+SouLucha> @dds333a you would think after all that this would be it, right? But nope that was like 1/3.
[5:05:49] <%dds333a> @soulucha it's not even that, I just assumed by the name LUL
[5:05:56] <Treasure_Vault> Is this area more straightforward than the previous, at least?

[5:17:41] <Treasure_Vault> Upgrade your hammer, brothers.

[5:18:48] <Treasure_Vault> Blessed be
[5:18:53] <MrEli111> Reggie the best
[5:18:54] <+SouLucha> The tarnished seal upgrade is more valuable than weapon upgrades atm.
[5:19:33] <%SirGO0SE> reggie looking fresh with the shave
[5:19:58] <+theoldone001> Catacombs was the best level for me personally
[5:20:15] <%SirGO0SE> yeah the enviornments are real pretty
[5:20:15] <%dds333a> Ice and flame are the best designed thus far
[5:20:19] <%SirGO0SE> its what they do with it
[5:20:34] <+SouLucha> Yeah, not wrong.
[5:20:37] <%dds333a> Ice and particular had variety
[5:20:39] <0078thunder> i really like the combat and art design, level design isnt great
[5:20:52] <MrEli111> @woolieversus at least the entire hub isn't poison swamp.
[5:21:01] <%dds333a> But stone is empty
[5:21:36] <+OrangeMDT> Harris is the best. They don’t know
[5:21:37] <%baronblank> This seems like the kinda game to have a sequel that invalidates the first because it fixes a ton of the issues
[5:21:49] <Treasure_Vault> You're in a double damage state.
[5:21:53] <+OrangeMDT> *Harros
[5:21:58] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> always assume you're killable lol
[5:21:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:22:16] <+theoldone001> This and the Surge 2 are the best Souls like attempts to me
[5:22:29] <%Deasmeister> I mean Sekiro you could just pause
[5:22:34] <+Jiggisnipe> just have an overlay instead of big menu transition
[5:22:37] <MrEli111> I like harros because he's the only one with skills that revolve around Harden.
[5:22:39] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> I Stan Surge 2 also
[5:22:53] <Treasure_Vault> stink hammer
[5:23:03] <%dds333a> training dummy
[5:23:10] <+SouLucha> The final seal upgrade is in this area too... But..
[5:23:16] <%dds333a> neat animation
[5:23:19] <%dds333a> at least
[5:23:22] <%Deasmeister> AOE
[5:23:25] <+OrangeMDT> @mreli111 and increased glimpse drops, I think
[5:23:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> there was like, a storm of chisels
[5:23:39] <+SouLucha> lol
[5:23:41] <moonmintparadise> its an AOE combo
[5:23:44] <%hax_metatron> WOMP WOMP WOMP
[5:23:50] <buerdo> aoe
[5:23:53] <%dds333a> it's probably better against eaither several enemies, or less tanky guys
[5:23:54] <huskarl_zap> max'll give that 4 outta 10
[5:23:58] <%hax_metatron> Nothing is as good as the Ballistazooka
[5:24:01] <MrEli111> @orangemdt yes.
[5:24:15] <Ech0Log1ck> You are completely invulnerable while you do that
[5:24:15] <moonmintparadise> none of these really POP
[5:24:23] <sirrice77> does the axatana have cool upgrades?
[5:24:38] <+theoldone001> I went Tiel and Martyr's Blade and I loved it, all that stamina was fun with heavy attacks.
[5:24:46] <+Landedx> but poison damage
[5:25:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Game is ok not amazing
[5:25:11] <%dds333a> great
[5:25:15] <%livlinn> woolieGASM
[5:25:17] <+SouLucha> It's a good spot to stop at
[5:25:17] <0078thunder> @theoldone001 did the marytrs blade get a lot better with upgrades? it felt so weak at base
[5:25:25] <%dds333a> Love titles that change, always have
[5:25:27] <Estwilde> GG y'all.
[5:25:39] <%Deasmeister> @theoldone001 with tile it's great just swing heavy weapons forever
[5:25:41] <AngryAsian5> Fun session
[5:25:44] <%livlinn> soooo what's on tomorrow? joofbLurk
[5:25:48] <derap41> Good not great
[5:25:51] <Estwilde> Dodm
[5:25:55] <+theoldone001> @0078thunder Yeah it ended up hitting harder, Hammer and Chisel is pretty OP just cause it hits so much more though but it was still fun.
[5:26:04] <MrEli111> @orangemdt he also has immediate stamina recovery on Harden.
[5:26:05] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 6/10 clone game isn't as good as Dark Souls? Wow who knew
[5:26:19] <moonmintparadise> its a good 7
[5:26:33] <+Jiggisnipe> BALLISTAZOOKA
[5:26:34] <%dds333a> the basic kit is neat
[5:26:37] <+BelricPsytar> The voice acting's amazing
[5:26:41] <+theoldone001> Needs tighter level design and more loot variety
[5:26:41] <%Indigo_Automaton> I'd say it's about a B-
[5:26:43] <LunarRemix> But it feels like there's not much going on in the world itself or the NPCs. Like the story's a big nothing.
[5:26:45] <%Ashenik1> man, even nioh had better level design, and that says a lot. MS i better looking though.
[5:26:49] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> the world isnt as fascinating as the Soulsbornes unfortunately
[5:27:07] <derap41> and most of them are pointless
[5:27:16] <MikeyxStyles> buy more firebombs
[5:27:17] <%Deasmeister> I feel like they thought people would switch shells on the fly all the time which doesn't happen with most people
[5:27:28] <derap41> More is not always better
[5:27:32] <%dds333a> @mikeyxstyles always good advice
[5:28:08] <@Solidus_113> good concept, bad execution
[5:28:18] <%Ashenik1> is it worse than the surge?
[5:28:19] <0078thunder> enemies not loading in until theyre right in front of you half the time also feels BS
[5:28:22] <penitentpendant> I'd be fine if "Level 0" told you what it was, but more use made it better
[5:28:25] <%baka_sugoi> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[5:28:40] <%dds333a> @baka_sugoi LUL LUL LUL
[5:28:42] <@Solidus_113> I'd say it'd work if you can have someone at firelink to inspect your items and tell you about them
[5:28:47] <%holydeviant1> @penitentpendant Yeah, this. Or if Familiarity just unlocked lore
[5:28:49] <+SouLucha> @0078thunder that actually seems intentional
[5:28:54] <moonmintparadise> this is a game whos sequel will erase the first one for sure, if they ever create a second one
[5:28:54] <%dds333a> ideally
[5:29:00] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> those messages help make it feel less lonely also
[5:29:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1478257606875815940?t=yjLm7ZYgulpaxSOSAEFNpA&s=19
[5:29:08] <theredfox930000> wollie and reggie looking young right now
[5:29:18] <%Ashenik1> @OverzealousEuthanasiast woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:29:22] <%Deasmeister> I prefer the souls method of animating enemies at half framerate instead of loading them in on top of you
[5:29:24] <Estwilde> Overall I dig the game
[5:29:35] <derap41> Better than Lords of The Fallen
[5:29:36] <Estwilde> Pretty fun
[5:29:39] <0078thunder> @SouLucha some of them like the ghosts and fire guys are, but like basic bandits and other grunts dont. I think its a bug
[5:29:48] <LunarRemix> @Deasmeister Code Vein does that too
[5:29:49] <%Ashenik1> PORTABLE BALISTA THOUGH
[5:30:12] <+OrangeMDT> You’ll definitely finish the game next time
[5:30:12] <+Jiggisnipe> ^
[5:30:17] <derap41> more than a year after release
[5:30:19] <BlackermanZX> the whole lot of nothing on the stages is weird though
[5:30:20] <wawila> *Enemies spawn in front of you
[5:30:27] <%dds333a> @orangemdt Kappa
[5:30:27] <+theoldone001> Katana Axe is awesome though
[5:30:30] <+SouLucha> Yeah next stream he should be able to finish it.
[5:30:36] <+mechslayer71> did they finish?
[5:30:40] <+mechslayer71> oh nvm
[5:30:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though that's a playstation only thing I hear
[5:31:05] <penitentpendant> This feels like a 'Wiki Game' like Warframe. You need external information for proper enjoyment.
[5:31:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> A bad game?
[5:31:22] <%dds333a> They're one ( Kappa ) session
[5:31:25] <MrEli111> @theoldone001 does he have the DLC?
[5:31:27] <derap41> Broken LoD
[5:31:27] <%RigmaroleHM> You're just playing so fast
[5:31:27] <+Jiggisnipe> I wonder if it's all on purpose
[5:31:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @penitentpendant only for the items really
[5:31:36] <%Ashenik1> maybe they are ex CDPR devs
[5:31:38] <+SouLucha> @SouLucha Odd, don't think that happened to me, the fire guys at least have some sort of phasing in with their bullshit
[5:31:41] <Estwilde> Did y'all see the new Bomb Rush Cyberfunk trailer today? PogChamp
[5:31:56] <derap41> Bomb Rush CyberFunk looks awesome
