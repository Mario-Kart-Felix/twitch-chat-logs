[0:27:54] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer500 I previously said Boruto was in my top 10 anime, so I thought I'd start a (short) explanation; I absolutely loved the setting of early Naruto, the village and the student/school setting. Naruto's story went way too high stakes for my tastes, I really just wanted to see more ninja postmen and village lore, the big arcs and major story events never did it for me. so Boruto keeping the stakes very low and focusing on the minor stuff is really to my liking.

[0:29:01] <+fateirony> OBJECTION!
[0:29:02] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer500 everything big Boruto does feels more like a school trip (especially the new seven swordsmen), or kids getting up to some dumbass bullshit than it does a major world changing event, which I absolutely love. The hidden leaf village feels like home away from home, so I love Boruto for developing it and focusing on what's happening to it, instead of prancing off into missions/wars all the time.

[0:33:13] <fist_wizard_jay> jobber fodder
[0:33:14] <ittla> naruto would've been really good with one-piece level world building
[0:33:19] <+ggbhtg> This sounds like a "I only like Bleach season 1" thing
[0:33:22] <%hitorio> Nah. The dad's hair isn't basic. It's hideous
[0:33:30] <+ggbhtg> which is correct
[0:33:30] <+Superbro64> screw high school settings
[0:33:33] <flipperdee> Y i k e s
[0:33:36] <+Bluydee> all the big stakes in Boruto is mostly just passing it to Sasuke and Naruto to handle
[0:33:37] <metaloverlordx> school settings are always relatable
[0:33:43] <Skeletonmanners> THATS SMT WOOLIE
[0:33:47] <Shishi1205> College Persona Pog
[0:33:47] <CozyGUNNA> @bluydee fr
[0:33:48] <nothuzad> Bluydee it is but it is all big stakes
[0:33:48] <MSN04_Sazabi> Kindergarten Persona
[0:33:50] <%hitorio> Neither parent has pink hair
[0:33:51] <powerprotoman> woolie thats innocent sin
[0:33:51] <MyNameIsRasus> College settings are always cooler
[0:33:55] <CozyGUNNA> woolie
[0:33:55] <+Prevot> yeah, that's fucking smt
[0:33:56] <Dragon_Batman> I honestly only want to see the interactions in Boruto
[0:33:56] <%masterpiecejeremy> we need Ninja college
[0:33:57] <+ggbhtg> Bleach needed to be low stakes for longer
[0:33:58] <flipperdee> OH MY GOD
[0:33:59] <%gatorafan> Regular high school student gets isekai'd into a high school
[0:34:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Golden Time > Toradora
[0:34:03] <JetpackMcQuack> But then, Boruto has to fallow up the end of Naruto, which is a huge de-escalation
[0:34:03] <CozyGUNNA> shin megami tensei bro
[0:34:06] <flipperdee> i googled them holy christ
[0:34:07] <WanderingSwordsman> it won't work in a jpn work setting
[0:34:13] <+Superbro64> this is the issue of the shonen genre you know too
[0:34:14] <%Irridium> wasn't that Persona 2?
[0:34:18] <%ultrasparkseid> Play P2
[0:34:23] <Shishi1205> power of minigun is strong in boruto tho
[0:34:26] <%VidulaSaix> I wanna go back to 2 for the same reason
[0:34:30] <Dragon_Batman> That father is a trip of a design huh?
[0:34:31] <zepelinnn1> just play strange journey and SMT4
[0:34:32] <CozyGUNNA> persona 2 is highschool and after highschool
[0:34:33] <+ggbhtg> It's like Buffy, imo
[0:34:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But season 1 of bleach is the best season. It's not even that good, it just isn't as much of a perpetual asspull as the rest
[0:34:37] <beno113> Thanks Bort
[0:34:40] <%hitorio> It's possible for Boruto to be sick. It just had to execute; its more relaxed setting isn't that much of an issue
[0:34:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> NOCTURNE is the fucking best
[0:34:44] <+Bluydee> the early monster of the week episodic parts of battle manga are always fun
[0:34:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Play Strange Journey, it the best SMT
[0:34:55] <%hitorio> Bleach OP 1 is so nostalgic
[0:35:07] <%hitorio> ...nostalgic without the "longing" part. Just pleasant
[0:35:07] <+ggbhtg> Im saying that Bleach S1 is the best
[0:35:08] <CozyGUNNA> nocturne is amazing
[0:35:12] <+PeanutJesus> With so much new shit, why anybody would watch Boruto is beyond me
[0:35:18] <+Superbro64> is boruto writted by kishimoto?
[0:35:22] <%Irridium> bleach OP 1 so good it tricked me into watching Bleach for longer than I should have
[0:35:22] <%hitorio> ^no
[0:35:23] <+ggbhtg> Bleach should've stayed low stakes
[0:35:25] <MyNameIsRasus> I think My Hero Academia's setting would make more sense if UA was a college instead of a High School. It preppin' you for a job and all.
[0:35:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nocturne might be my favorite RPG
[0:35:27] <djazo> BLEACH OP 1 OH GOD NOSTALGIA
[0:35:30] <Shishi1205> like dbz?
[0:35:30] <flipperdee> I dont like that boruto's hair has two pieces to it
[0:35:33] <Dragon_Batman> Powercreep is a dangerous drug
[0:35:37] <+Superbro64> huh. how about that then
[0:35:37] <%masterpiecejeremy> anyone hyped for Witcher tomorrow?
[0:35:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[0:35:43] <+Prevot> bleach op 1 is way too good for bleach
[0:35:43] <Dragon_Batman> Hell yea
[0:35:47] <%hitorio> @Superbro64 There are short arcs written by Kishimoto. ...those arcs are usually accompanied by more attention to detail on the animation :P
[0:35:51] <Dragon_Batman> Witcher I mean
[0:35:51] <CozyGUNNA> like dragon ball
[0:35:52] <%hitorio> but overal, nah
[0:35:54] <%LeaIsChill> My Hero does that
[0:35:55] <+katarjin> @masterpiecejeremy not me.. fights looked ass
[0:35:57] <rheviel> Dragonball is always the example for power creep lol
[0:35:58] <jonathandemel> @WoolieVersus You're still a madman with the vomit
[0:35:58] <thexiiilightning> Frieza and Trunks lol
[0:35:59] <SteinsApprentice> aone punch man
[0:36:01] <+katarjin> but have fun
[0:36:02] <%VidulaSaix> You say that Woolie, but One Punch Man is exactly that. Every villain is fodder @WoolieVersus
[0:36:02] <+thatfig> Ninja Storm 4 time?
[0:36:02] <CozyGUNNA> HxH has good powercreep
[0:36:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> One Punch man
[0:36:07] <JetpackMcQuack> Vegita -> Frieza -> Cell -> Raditz
[0:36:12] <SteinsApprentice> for reals opm
[0:36:15] <jonathandemel> DLC fight time I think
[0:36:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> HXH only kind of has power creep
[0:36:23] <+thatfig> ah dlc
[0:36:25] <+PeanutJesus> Araki managed to fix power creep by introducing stands, it was the best solution to the problem all shonen deal with
[0:36:26] <%ozzrabbit> Isn’t that the point of One-Punch man?
[0:36:31] <flipperdee> Boruto is just like any longform anime Occaisionnaly TERRIBLE animation next to AMAZING animation
[0:36:35] <Dragon_Batman> Pilaf and gang are just children next to gods
[0:36:39] <%Irridium> not dragon balls, the BLACK dragon balls
[0:36:45] <fist_wizard_jay> MHA is a recent favorite of mine
[0:36:46] <+ggbhtg> Bleach season 2 and OP2 are high stakes and NEVER STOPS so everyone before that season gets left behind
[0:36:48] <CozyGUNNA> balls?
[0:36:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Like Pat said, after a certain point, it's just "i am going to use my nen for the WEIRDEST shit"
[0:36:51] <austin9568> Welcome to the Grand Tour!
[0:36:52] <%hitorio> Yu-Gi-Oh's stakes were sky high, but Yu-Gi-Oh GX shined in its own way because its "duel choreography" and school setting extracted a lot more creativity in a different way
[0:36:59] <jonathandemel> @fruit_pie_the_magician Not even, they just do a "they were actually suuuuper strong all along" kind of power creep, but that's still power creep
[0:36:59] <+deidriel> Please give what you see in the game today a watch on the anime it is one of the best anime episodes of naruto
[0:37:19] <MSN04_Sazabi> GX stakes went just as high and way more dumb than OG
[0:37:34] <%hitorio> Must've been later on, then. I'm mostly refering to the start.
[0:37:48] <Shishi1205> king picolo? or picolo?
[0:37:49] <fist_wizard_jay> I mean a lot of the stuff after the end of NUNS 3 is pretty fuckin hypd
[0:37:51] <Lionkevinson> Baby in GT was a weak villain
[0:37:51] <lunacys_straightjacket> gx was just as high stakes as the og wdym
[0:37:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> To be fair up until then everyone they're fighting is just fighting a pair of 12 year olds
[0:37:52] <%hitorio> Making a reference to how Boruto can still be fun as fuck to watch if it stuck its creative landings.
[0:37:53] <fist_wizard_jay> hype*
[0:37:53] <%lordsdb> Demon King, or Reborn?
[0:37:55] <Dragon_Batman> The worst part of power creep is that alot of the cast gets thrown to the side, in most cases
[0:38:04] <flipperdee> I havent watch stream too much Is woolie making sure to watch all the important fights in the anime after fighting in the game?
[0:38:10] <Lionkevinson> Baby in Gt was a weak villain
[0:38:15] <0rond> arc v prolly had the highest stakes
[0:38:19] <+PeanutJesus> Everything was weak in GT
[0:38:24] <+ggbhtg> Renji and Byakuya showing up are basically the Saiyans showing up
[0:38:30] <djazo> i tried to watch GT my soul died every minute
[0:38:32] <Shishi1205> GT felt forced
[0:38:36] <MyNameIsRasus> I still think a story about vertical escalation CAN work, but execution needs to be top notch throughout. That's one of the reasons OPM season 1 was awesome: yeah the fights involved zero thinking, but damn it if they didn't look awesome.
[0:38:37] <jonathandemel> @fruit_pie_the_magician Well you could say the same about Naruto, don't see how that's so valid
[0:38:37] <JetpackMcQuack> Strongest ninja on the swingset DxCat
[0:38:38] <Lionkevinson> But baby was a good villain
[0:38:41] <%lordsdb> Omega is still my favorite villian for gt, mostly because of his design
[0:38:45] <fist_wizard_jay> I dont want to remember GT
[0:38:47] <flipperdee> i watched all of GT i scared the hell out of me
[0:38:50] <jonathandemel> Naruto has mega powercreep
[0:38:51] <Dragon_Batman> He only saw MAdara's intro in the war and hasn't seen anything else, I believe @flipperdee
[0:38:52] <@Solidus_113> Sent the emotes to your Twitter DMs @WoolieVersus
[0:38:54] <Solidnick18> fair
[0:38:57] <+Prevot> GT had a few good ideas but all the execution was terrible
[0:39:01] <%hitorio> No one spoil how Tiger Mizuki comes in and defeats the Ninja Alliance
[0:39:02] <Dovakhin573> lol
[0:39:06] <flipperdee> like baby's whole assymilation thing fucked me up
[0:39:08] <djazo> let.s all forget GT deal?
[0:39:09] <masterfire23> GT op is sick
[0:39:10] <Dovakhin573> scaling boruto is dumb
[0:39:14] <fist_wizard_jay> I binge watch TFS abridged series of DBZ to forget GT
[0:39:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The difference is that Naruto is literally ninja jesus in like three different ways\
[0:39:25] <+ggbhtg> step into the GRAN TOUR
[0:39:27] <Shishi1205> Man trunks GT sucked FeelsBadMan
[0:39:27] <%lordsdb> Funny enough I know more people who were fine with gt though still accepting it's flaws
[0:39:35] <Dragon_Batman> The space travel stuff should have been better in GT
[0:39:37] <+PeanutJesus> Has anybody read Fire Punch
[0:39:44] <MyNameIsRasus> @hitorio I REMEMBER TIGER MIZUKI
[0:39:48] <Shishi1205> Yes @PeanutJesus
[0:39:50] <jonathandemel> @fruit_pie_the_magician He could be ninja jesus without the power creep. It's all to do with scale, not context
[0:39:51] <%hitorio> I liked GT's art style, but them making Goku a child again... without actually reaping the benefit of it (Dragon Ball creativity) and only keeping the weaknesses (Goku is nerfed) was super unsatisfying
[0:39:53] <+Prevot> like, the evil dragons was a great concept but the execution was bad
[0:39:58] <+ggbhtg> and now Woolie is describing the ninja war's anime filler...
[0:40:00] <+JRodJames> @masterfire23 Saban's DBZ op as pretty sick too
[0:40:05] <%lordsdb> @PeanutJesus I have, gotta buy the final volume though
[0:40:14] <saiyan24675> Hello
[0:40:15] <flipperdee> The problem with boruto Thats also kinda cool is that it takes place RIGHT AFTER what will eventually be a legendary time in history from the perspective of the world
[0:40:19] <%LeaIsChill> The Ninja War does that but no one can die bc Naruto
[0:40:24] <MyNameIsRasus> GT's finale was the best DBZ has ever had
[0:40:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Naruto sucks, but it doesn'
[0:40:37] <DonStylow> I wish there is an anime with a power level system that makes the character weaker every time he uses his power. So he is forced to use tools and trick his enemies into using their powers so he can overpower them.
[0:40:41] <%lordsdb> 2 of the evil dragons were done alright, 4 star and 7
[0:40:41] <MSN04_Sazabi> I dunno, I'd take Stardust Memory over 08th MS any day.
[0:40:42] <djazo> @woolieversus i gonna say this the special ep of gt is one of the best ep from dragon ball
[0:40:46] <NickHatesSnow> Mr. btounge
[0:40:48] <JetpackMcQuack> R A M E N
[0:40:52] <flipperdee> Jojo?
[0:40:55] <+Prevot> they eat Pokemon btw
[0:41:03] <+PeanutJesus> Super great manga, an analysis of the hero archetype with a very interesting setting, he's permanently on fire but regenerates faster than he burns so he lives
[0:41:03] <WanderingSwordsman> I need to see them use the bathroom to be immersed
[0:41:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> t really have power creep. Just like half the cast literally turn into immortal gods at some point and everybody else might as well be dead
[0:41:21] <@Solidus_113> A lot of the power scaling storytelling is what makes My Hero Academia so great.
[0:41:22] <+aishman> Oh right I keep forgetting about this.
[0:41:29] <flipperdee> Jojo seems to be the only like fight show that has the protag have the same powers for the whole time
[0:41:35] <%Irridium> Old Legend of the Galactic Heroes is A+ at capturing EVERY layer. From the rulers to the peasants in the dirt. It's fucking great.
[0:41:46] <jonathandemel> @fruit_pie_the_magician I'm not denying that Naruto has power creep, I'm just saying that HxH has it too, in spades
[0:41:46] <lunacys_straightjacket> @DonStylow so basically everyone gets weaker with each use and it isn't specific to the mc?
[0:41:50] <lonlono> if goku was put out of comission in the gt, the anime would have had actual stakes

[0:43:13] <%hitorio> Naruto feels like that action game that's fun to platinum or SSS or whatever, but the lore puts a sour taste in your mouth
[0:43:13] <laserbeaming> yay Killer Instinct
[0:43:14] <+ggbhtg> Get into Nalt!
[0:43:20] <jonathandemel> No don't, keep it like this
[0:43:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Most of the time HXH at least is "this is how my power works, because i worked on it" Naruto is just "WHOA I just got way way stronger because I read a scroll"
[0:43:21] <+Bluydee> in One Piece Luffy has the same strength for like all of pre-timeskip beyond coming up with Gear 2 and 3
[0:43:25] <austin9568> For Free or Legend
[0:43:28] <metaloverlordx> blow that nose
[0:43:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @VidulaSaix Did he do the prequiste?
[0:43:42] <%VidulaSaix> I'm sure he or Minh one did
[0:43:43] <Cameony> best way to experience this game is on the stadia, boyos. Best console ever to come out
[0:43:46] <%hitorio> @Bluydee No, Luffy actually gets straight-up stronger and more skilled in battle - drastically
[0:43:47] <fist_wizard_jay> woooooh get your nalt on
[0:43:48] <StarlitStunner> Boruto’s Dad’s dead son
[0:43:49] <flipperdee> Will wool play the 1v1 mode for fun after he finishes the game?

[0:44:12] <+thatfig> the dlc seems short no?
[0:44:13] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[0:44:13] <MyNameIsRasus> I think the Nen system is as close as we're getting to a perfect power system in a shonen.
[0:44:15] <%hitorio> @Bluydee and for an example of the manga itself stating that, Buggy comments on it after seeing Luffy one shot enemies that are giving them a hard time in Impel Down
[0:44:16] <+kaiju7544> Y’all make me want to go play fighting games right now
[0:44:17] <shadowsofpain> Get into Naruto... For Business!
[0:44:31] <%hitorio> ...for business :P
[0:44:33] <MyNameIsRasus> @shadowsofpain that's strong

[0:44:39] <fist_wizard_jay> ayyy
[0:44:41] <StarlitStunner> spyCappa for pleasure
[0:44:42] <lonlono> isn't nen just stands?
[0:44:42] <jonathandemel> @fruit_pie_the_magician As I said, having context for power creep doesn't mean it's not power creep, I don't see why you bring that up. Just because you have a reason for characters getting way stronger doesn't change that the scale becomes bigger
[0:44:45] <%gatorafan> So... Is this going to be a short stream or is Woolie going to reveal the next LP live?
[0:44:45] <facuvillamil> are you guys going to check out the ultimates when story's done? I'm sure there's a bunch you don't see
[0:44:53] <flipperdee> Id recommend playing it if he's interested in seening stuff like the Jutsu of the old Jinchuriki

[0:53:45] <Shishi1205> this is the eternal one tho
[0:53:47] <+medinaj1990> I personally always liked Sasuke's reason for not taking Itachi's eyes and thought it was bulshit when Kishimoto changed it
[0:53:51] <fist_wizard_jay> what the fuck
[0:53:54] <+thatfig> how long is the dlc?
[0:53:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Sasuke now has Eternal Mangekyo
[0:53:59] <%hitorio> Kishimoto didn't put any thought into it; anything's possible. Kappa

[0:57:06] <%hitorio> Could genin Uchiha Sarada defeat genin Uchiha Sasuke?
[0:57:07] <helidzz> yes
[0:57:07] <Shishi1205> yeah
[0:57:07] <thexiiilightning> yep
[0:57:09] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[0:57:13] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah
[0:57:13] <Dragon_Batman> That did happen yes
[0:57:13] <+TopTieramisu> zetsu fly trap
[0:57:15] <austin9568> Parahnah plant
[0:57:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Filler enemies LUL
[0:57:18] <biomegabear> good filler or bad filler?
[0:57:24] <fist_wizard_jay> bad
[0:57:25] <MyNameIsRasus> Zetsu is body horror the character
[0:57:25] <flipperdee> they werent filler
[0:57:29] <+texflexrex> iit happened in regular cannon too
[0:57:32] <helidzz> that was not filler tho
[0:57:34] <flipperdee> they were part of the war
[0:57:37] <fist_wizard_jay> what in the actual fuck
[0:57:39] <Dragon_Batman> That was a last ditch effort to stop Sasuke
[0:57:44] <Crashfan01> don't remember this in a manga. Was this in the manga?
[0:57:47] <CommanderSqueaks> Wait is Zetsu a good guy now?
[0:57:52] <Shishi1205> not even fillers saved us from them
[0:57:55] <@Solidus_113> now you have awakening
[0:57:57] <+PeanutJesus> Zetsu is a plant
[0:58:01] <Shishi1205> Zetsus fucking sucked massive dick
[0:58:03] <%hitorio> In the manga, Sasuke quickly bodied some Zetsus and headed to the battlefield
[0:58:05] <jonathandemel> BODIED
[0:58:06] <thexiiilightning> 'easy mode'
[0:58:08] <Arblaster_> Zetsu exists so he could draw characters without filling in any details at all
[0:58:08] <flipperdee> he was a villain still
[0:58:15] <Iggeh0> @Crashfan01 yes but it's a single page where Sasuke wrecks them
[0:58:15] <fist_wizard_jay> Zetsu you aint lookin so good
[0:58:22] <fist_wizard_jay> gained a lot of weight
[0:58:26] <Solidnick18> oh they are tough
[0:58:29] <biomegabear> Inferno style: Flame Control does look cool
[0:58:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> So this is a villain versus villain fight? got it.
[0:58:47] <MyNameIsRasus> It's not filler
[0:58:47] <helidzz> yes you did
[0:58:47] <thexiiilightning> we have tho
[0:58:48] <%hitorio> He did a brutal interrogation-kill on a Zetsu to establish how DARK he is
[0:58:49] <+TopTieramisu> sasuke is an anti-hero, technically
[0:58:51] <jonathandemel> It is filler right now, but the ACTUAL fights aren't filler
[0:58:52] <+texflexrex> oki minh
[0:58:56] <Dragon_Batman> It did happen during this tho
[0:58:59] <helidzz> @WoolieVersus you saw them when naruto escaped with bee
[0:59:00] <thexiiilightning> mihn you're super wrong XD
[0:59:01] <%VidulaSaix> Cause its eternal mangekyou now
[0:59:02] <+Bluydee> the other translation of blaze release also sounds lame but is way better than inferno style
[0:59:03] <%VidulaSaix> SO SPAM IT
[0:59:03] <Iggeh0> this is after Naruto vs Itachi and Nagato
[0:59:08] <@Solidus_113> Susan relegated to a combo ender
[0:59:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @toptieramisu How many people has he murdered so far?
[0:59:10] <Iggeh0> so yes you did see them at this point
[0:59:12] <MyNameIsRasus> He has Eternal Mangekyo, no downside
[0:59:13] <Sedrelic> mini susan is free

[1:00:13] <NinjaGentleman> after he fought Naruto after sakura botched it he traded his eyes out with itachis and obtained the eternal mangekyo sharigan that has no downsides to using susan @WoolieVersus
[1:00:17] <+texflexrex> okay yeah this is before the war starts, and before we would even see the big zetsus

[1:02:01] <%jazzcrasher> Where is this coming from? cmonBruh

[1:02:09] <NiktenKing> YES

[1:02:10] <optimasmaximas> @WanderingSwordsman oof
[1:02:12] <+Vikken141> yes
[1:02:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He no longer needs to change eyeballs
[1:02:19] <spawnzie> like what if put a rinnegan in
[1:02:19] <%VidulaSaix> That's correct
[1:02:24] <Dragon_Batman> He now doesn't have to worry bout going blind
[1:02:27] <+NiSoKr> It's very special change with only brother eyes
[1:02:28] <+TopTieramisu> remember when sharingan and byakugan were considered equal?
[1:02:29] <%Irridium> that's broken as fuck
[1:02:33] <MyNameIsRasus> Keeps his powers, the way they handle cirurgy in this anime is like they mix the eyes
[1:02:35] <jonathandemel> Both
[1:02:35] <CozyGUNNA> DONT ASK QUESTIONS
[1:02:38] <Graxe_> It's both
[1:02:38] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> yes
[1:02:38] <jonathandemel> It's the chakra
[1:02:38] <MyNameIsRasus> It's stupid
[1:02:39] <NinjaGentleman> he got itachi's eyes which when you trade eyes with a close blood relative they get a buff and the blindness is cured cause dumb Uchiha genetics @WoolieVersus
[1:02:40] <Shishi1205> its the eyes? Both?
[1:02:41] <Sapphire_Breeze> Mangekyo unlocks in the brain
[1:02:42] <biomegabear> minh just read chat
[1:02:42] <NiktenKing> Yes
[1:02:43] <Iggeh0> ....eyes are party of the body
[1:02:43] <+PeanutJesus> This is like a conversation somebody would make up to mock people into anime

[1:02:44] <CozyGUNNA> JUST CONSUME PRODUCT
[1:02:45] <flipperdee> oh wait i know this answet
[1:02:46] <+kaiju7544> Madara has his little brother’s eyes in his eternal mangekyo
[1:02:48] <thexiiilightning> The secret eye is on the waist
[1:02:50] <tookool5678> some of the power are transferred over.
[1:02:51] <%TheDyingPride> He's asking if he trades his eyes out again, will he keep mangekyo
[1:02:52] <+NiSoKr> It won
[1:02:53] <+veraverse> Hey y'all... BELIEVE IT
[1:02:56] <NiktenKing> He doesn't need more eyeballs
[1:02:58] <R3c0n31> i think woolie using the term Buff is messing up the line of questioning
[1:03:00] <+kaiju7544> It’s an Uchiha thing
[1:03:04] <optimasmaximas> NotLikeThis
[1:03:04] <jonathandemel> @WoolieVersus NONONO, only his direct relative's eyes
[1:03:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[1:03:09] <%hitorio> The eyes are just decorative. The true Sharingan is the testicles.
[1:03:10] <flipperdee> @woolieversus Its because the chakra that creates the Sharingan is formed in the brain
[1:03:11] <acedeone> Thats bullshit...but I BELIEVE IT
[1:03:12] <+Manderson1998> woolie, refill your iems
[1:03:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus Replacing your physical eyeballs, with your brother's eyes, allows you to use your bullshit eye powers infinitely
[1:03:15] <Dragon_Batman> It sounds like your saying if he switches eyes he will get new powers
[1:03:15] <Morning_Asakura> naruto is stupid
[1:03:17] <optimasmaximas> NO @WoolieVersus
[1:03:21] <xeros720> it's dumb shonen anime shit
[1:03:22] <%VidulaSaix> WURDS
[1:03:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie has a hard time articulating his point LUL
[1:03:23] <Shishi1205> He has no downsides now
[1:03:26] <+TopTieramisu> i want some infinite tsukiyaki
[1:03:27] <Div_the_Penguin> he asks if genjutsus still has effect on the eyes ?
[1:03:31] <Shishi1205> he has no needs to replace his eyes anymore
[1:03:35] <WanderingSwordsman> We need SwagKage
[1:03:38] <SteinsApprentice> madara and his brother eyes
[1:03:39] <NiktenKing> There's like 8
[1:03:42] <austin9568> But is Dr.Faust still a gun?
[1:03:46] <+kaiju7544> Eternal Mangekyo is achieved after the transplant of eyes from one uchiha to another
[1:03:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:03:47] <+LordAlexGram> the eyes have the power woolie

[1:03:50] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[1:03:51] <MyNameIsRasus> It's almost like the Sharingan is the worst thing to come out of Naruto
[1:03:51] <jonathandemel> Yes
[1:03:53] <optimasmaximas> @WanderingSwordsman "Alright, so MAdara Uchiha...."

[1:04:00] <thexiiilightning> I guess?
[1:04:00] <WanderingSwordsman> LUL
[1:04:02] <+NiSoKr> No the eyes are the power but not susan
[1:04:02] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:04:04] <%gatorafan> nice analogy :)
[1:04:04] <Div_the_Penguin> LUL
[1:04:05] <+veraverse> Okay
[1:04:05] <rheviel> he will Never lose his sight again so there will be no need to get new eyes
[1:04:07] <acedeone> saved it Woolz
[1:04:07] <flipperdee> the Chakra is formed in the brain so he can swap out his eyes all the time
[1:04:09] <+thatfig> infinite okonomiyaki
[1:04:09] <+TopTieramisu> @MyNameIsRasus sharingan was fine when it was just the copy ability
[1:04:20] <+NiSoKr> Nah they get it
[1:04:20] <NinjaGentleman> its implied the eyes have the power now, if he got new eyes they wouldn't be as strong cause there is no closer blood relations than his older brother @WoolieVersus
[1:04:22] <+PeanutJesus> infinite tsukiji fish market
[1:04:22] <%hitorio> Sharingan in Naruto. Meta-Knight/Bayonetta in Smash. Chun-Li in Third Strike.
[1:04:30] <monzy101> PogChamp
[1:04:33] <MyNameIsRasus> @TopTieramisu yeah but it stopped being that real fast
[1:04:35] <%VidulaSaix> Yes, which is why Kakashi was eventually able to learmn how to use Mangekyou as well
[1:04:36] <Div_the_Penguin> yeah Sasuke is still Takumi LUL
[1:04:36] <jonathandemel> @WoolieVersus You don't need to be powerful to get the Mangekyo. You need to suffer
[1:04:37] <+BurkeBigsby> Sasuke got Necalli VT1 when he took dem eyes.
[1:04:38] <+TopTieramisu> kishimoto went full jk rowling with sharingan
[1:04:38] <tookool5678> need skill.
[1:04:39] <Shishi1205> kinda? we dont really know
[1:04:42] <%VidulaSaix> It wasnt just automatically useable
[1:04:43] <+NiSoKr> They would get the full power if they knew how to use it
[1:04:45] <rheviel> Kakashi is an example
[1:04:48] <Masamune195> just because you have a car doesnt mean you know how to drive it
[1:04:49] <Jetsfantasy> Any transferred sharingan grants a buff iirc
[1:04:49] <Arblaster_> Actually I think if a non Uchiha gets the eyes they do get the powers
[1:04:50] <Iggeh0> Kakashi has someone else's mangekyo and he can use it
[1:05:04] <shadowsofpain> As long as it's an uchiha brand car yes
[1:05:05] <Shishi1205> that is true kakashi has mangekyo himself
[1:05:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Eyes as replacable equipment
[1:05:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus He could have infinite use of it, regardless of skill
[1:05:11] <+LordAlexGram> kikashi is only powerfull because of a eyeball
[1:05:20] <+TopTieramisu> if kishimoto went this nuts with sharingan, i wish he did the same with byakugan
[1:05:23] <Jetsfantasy> Kakashi also learned new shit after the transplant
[1:05:34] <jonathandemel> Yes
[1:05:40] <+PeanutJesus> None of the other eye techniques are interesting, it really is a shame
[1:05:44] <+NiSoKr> Sasuke's eyes have the special ability to make and control amaterasu.
[1:05:45] <MyNameIsRasus> That is correct
[1:05:48] <%gatorafan> Uchiha cars eat fuel like a bitch, only people of the family can drive them properly daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:05:50] <jonathandemel> @WoolieVersus That kinda happens
[1:05:52] <Graxe_> Remember how Danzo used Shisui's unique eye techniques to mind control people?
[1:05:53] <%hitorio> Kakashi was a genius prodigy without the Sharingan; Kishimoto just keeps NOT expressing that cause Kakashi's a jobber and has a stagnant "powerlevel"
[1:05:57] <Crashfan01> what does the rinnegan even do
[1:06:01] <biomegabear> @Jetsfantasy Kakashi gets another eye to his stronger at some point?
[1:06:12] <@Menitta> Like he knows how to drift but only on stick shift cars right?
[1:06:14] <+TopTieramisu> rinnegan does the everything
[1:06:16] <Shishi1205> The only important eyes are shishuis
[1:06:20] <+texflexrex> @Crashfan01 a lot of stuff
[1:06:21] <jonathandemel> @Crashfan01 Just read the wiki, it's easier
[1:06:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NEW JUTSU
[1:06:23] <optimasmaximas> @biomegabear shhhh
[1:06:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol what doesn't the rinnegan do
[1:06:25] <%hitorio> Like, the newbie ceremony for any villain is to shit on Kakashi
[1:06:30] <NinjaGentleman> rinnegan is broken af but its main uses are gravity control
[1:06:31] <+NiSoKr> His ult is so much better in storm 4
[1:06:32] <%hitorio> or to shit on someone who can shit on Kakashi
[1:06:33] <tookool5678> rinnegan gives gravity and god powers.
[1:06:34] <+TopTieramisu> rinnegan is the pokemon evolution of sharingan
[1:06:37] <%VidulaSaix> Jebaited
[1:06:43] <+Chronobot> nothin personal

[1:06:52] <wotebi> kakashi loses sharingan but gains purple lightning
[1:06:52] <MyNameIsRasus> @Crashfan01 resurrects the dead, controls machines, summons demons, controls gravity and magnetism, and some other shit
[1:06:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Naruto also a new Ulimate Jutsu you need to see

[1:07:14] <%Lion_kun> Also remember Uchihas who experience love get brain cancer so they're not responsible for their actions.
[1:07:16] <jonathandemel> He has substitutions dude
[1:07:17] <$Noponiz> NALT TIME
[1:07:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the ability to nullify all jutsu
[1:07:23] <%jinking79> yeah just make a Rant the Jutsu vid Woolie
[1:07:23] <Solidnick18> oh well
[1:07:24] <+LordAlexGram> if naruto got uchiha eyes he could do the same top tier abilities too
[1:07:24] <%hitorio> Rinnegan is fanfiction-powers - the eye
[1:07:25] <+TopTieramisu> the real reason other eye abilities don't get developed is because sharingan does EVERYTHING
[1:07:32] <NinjaGentleman> except those 2
[1:07:32] <Arblaster_> Wow that pose is such edge
[1:07:34] <austin9568> Edge boi

[1:07:43] <Personified134> @WoolieVersus just watch all the supers in multiplayer or something later
[1:07:45] <+NiSoKr> If Naruto got Uchiha eyes he would get mega eyes
[1:07:51] <+Bluydee> LUL
[1:07:54] <@Solidus_113> TRUE LEGEND
[1:07:56] <+ggbhtg> no raw dogs
[1:07:57] <BearSawed> Woolie has pointed out an inconsistency, the answer is it changes through the series. sometimes it transfers the powers sometimes it doesnt
[1:07:58] <%VidulaSaix> TRUE LEGEND
[1:08:01] <+TossuDa> Sasuke ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:08:04] <biomegabear> A Flash Grenade would be a sharingan weakness
[1:08:07] <optimasmaximas> @NiSoKr it would become the rinnegan shhh
[1:08:13] <Graxe_> The Rinnegan has the combined powers of all the bodies of Pain and Nagato.
[1:08:14] <+TopTieramisu> if naruto had sharingan, would his look an *?
[1:08:16] <NinjaGentleman> Minh hates Naruto confirmed
[1:08:30] <rheviel> Drift Woolie

[1:08:50] <+LordAlexGram> naruto should have got sasuke old eyes smh
[1:08:58] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus so yeah, this is happening while zombie Madara fights the 5 Kage
[1:09:01] <Shishi1205> look at his dumbass with the eyes clothed
[1:09:08] <BustRobot> Dubs LUL
[1:09:14] <jonathandemel> @Graxe_ The Rinnegan also has unique powers depending on the user, apparently
[1:09:15] <+NiSoKr> I don't know if sasuke's old eyes exist. It's unclear if the eyes are fused with Itachi's
[1:09:19] <optimasmaximas> @gatorafan ive literally only seen MAYBE 10 clips of Bort, and there is some love in the ones i saw
[1:09:20] <metaloverlordx> byakugan gets love by lady ninja god and her people
[1:09:22] <MyNameIsRasus> @gatorafan I think Bort has the ability to see malicious intent and I think it has something to do with the Byakugan
[1:09:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh god this line
[1:09:29] <aracon_> nut into me sasuke
[1:09:29] <%ultrasparkseid> Kreygasm Kreygasm

[1:09:44] <WanderingSwordsman> He's the only one that can take the full burst
[1:09:45] <optimasmaximas> TAKE IT
[1:09:45] <rheviel> Hate Boner
[1:09:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Narutos english voice is sooooo bad
[1:09:48] <+Bluydee> isn't the optimal thing for uchiha to do to trade eyes then? like Itachi and Sasuke just pass each other their eyes
[1:09:49] <%hitorio> @IHATREID he's doing DLC that explores canon stuff
[1:09:50] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:09:53] <Solidnick18> cause friends
[1:09:53] <%VidulaSaix> We're friends so lets die 4Head
[1:09:53] <djazo> i hate this dub
[1:09:54] <optimasmaximas> @BallerSwagBro9k ^
[1:09:56] <Dragon_Batman> This thick and heavy hatred
[1:09:57] <+NiSoKr> NAKAMA OR TOMODACHI NotLikeThis
[1:09:59] <jonathandemel> Why is the main character always the worst
[1:09:59] <%Irridium> I will take it all in me
[1:10:00] <Graxe_> The user can combine the six/seven properties to creative uses. Like how Madara used Meteor.
[1:10:02] <+LordAlexGram> naruto has super healing tho
[1:10:07] <+kyh9> "Because we're friends, guy who has done nothing but shit one me since we met"
[1:10:11] <+TopTieramisu> nart's ready to receive his thick, steamy hatred
[1:10:12] <Graxe_> And no one else used Meteor
[1:10:12] <jonathandemel> Yes
[1:10:13] <djazo> and put it in me LUL
[1:10:17] <Bloodxb> thick creamy hatred
[1:10:21] <optimasmaximas> GUIDE YOUR HATRED INTO ME
[1:10:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Wow, theres so much hatred, Sasuke
[1:10:22] <+kyh9> But that Tobi had the old mask
[1:10:23] <%IHATREID> @hitorio ah I gotcha
[1:10:23] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer500 More Boruto explanation; Boruto (the character) is also way closer to who I was as a kid than Naruto, naturally doing pretty well in everything and not really putting in any effort. The show's also very obviously aimed at kids and has very basic didactic moral lessons for every arc/episode, making the show feel episodic/seasonal, and seeing JUST HOW aimed at kids it is makes me feel really relaxed. I watch it almost as a slice of life show.
[1:10:24] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> mrfreezepunsbestpuns's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[1:10:26] <+LordAlexGram> and dna buffs too

[1:10:41] <jonathandemel> Oh no, HE KILLED A ZETSU
[1:10:41] <MyNameIsRasus> I've been saving up my hatred so it's extra thick and sticky
[1:10:43] <biomegabear> stab him right in the head
[1:10:47] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> D:
[1:10:48] <Graxe_> Oh no
[1:10:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:10:54] <Graxe_> Nine inches of hatred
[1:10:54] <+TopTieramisu> flaccid hate

[1:10:56] <joylent_blue> !MOTIVATED
[1:10:57] <@Moobot> 536 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:11:01] <WanderingSwordsman> That's it?
[1:11:03] <+LordAlexGram> rip zetsu
[1:11:05] <+ClaudeMcGarren> sweet girth'y hatred
[1:11:10] <+ggbhtg> Eternaru
[1:11:10] <jonathandemel> More more more
[1:11:14] <tookool5678> Now for DLC.
[1:11:15] <+ggbhtg> There's more
[1:11:17] <+jjjccc19> the rinnegan isn't the best dojustsu btw
[1:11:18] <%jinking79> White boy dead
[1:11:19] <optimasmaximas> eternal hatred boner
[1:11:20] <@Solidus_113> Might have to check the timeline for the DLC
[1:11:21] <+Raidou24> Theres more
[1:11:23] <+texflexrex> There's even more
[1:11:27] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's feeling bad
[1:11:29] <+ggbhtg> mada mada
[1:11:33] <Bloodxb> theres alot more
[1:11:34] <+NiSoKr> Killing them gets ability take eyes makes ability perfect
[1:11:34] <jonathandemel> For basic Mangekyo, you just need to suffer a lot.
[1:11:42] <Jetsfantasy> ^
[1:11:46] <+TopTieramisu> killing friend gets you mangekyo. stealing their eyes gives you infinite mangekyo
[1:11:47] <Shishi1205> no you get the ability if you kill itachi
[1:11:48] <nothuzad> for infinite you need to feel sad about killing
[1:11:49] <jonathandemel> If you want the Eternal Mangekyo, you have to take your sibling's eyes
[1:11:51] <Dragon_Batman> Well the ability unlocks because of that loss
[1:11:53] <optimasmaximas> the fights are on the timeline in the game @WoolieVersus
[1:11:53] <%hitorio> Kill Em = Get Mangekyo. Take eyes = Upgrade Mangekyo.
[1:11:55] <WanderingSwordsman> Christ, even bloodborne dlc is easier to get to
[1:11:56] <+TopTieramisu> eternal*
[1:11:57] <NinjaGentleman> killing your loved one is not the main way of doing it but it can happen @WoolieVersus
[1:11:57] <rheviel> Taking the eyes prevents blindness
[1:12:00] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[1:12:00] <biomegabear> magekyo seems like OP
[1:12:01] <MyNameIsRasus> You kill someone you love to get Mangekyo, you get someone else's Mangekyo to use it forever
[1:12:03] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus The only homework here is the manga page where Sasuke's EMS is revealed.
[1:12:03] <Shishi1205> yes
[1:12:11] <djazo> you need to take the eyes
[1:12:12] <dundore77> you also don't gain their abilities if you take his eyes. Sasuke can't use tsukiyomi as thats itachi only. sasuke gets amatrasu and the ability to turn off amatrasu
[1:12:13] <+LordAlexGram> only siblings
[1:12:13] <+NiSoKr> This has also only been done like twice ever by the way
[1:12:19] <+ggbhtg> minh is currently correct
[1:12:21] <@Menitta> Wait who did Kakashi kill then
[1:12:22] <facuvillamil> killing them and taking their eyes are two different process
[1:12:22] <%Lion_kun> How did Itachi have eternal mangekyo?
[1:12:23] <+NiSoKr> Yes
[1:12:25] <Dragon_Batman> For Uchihas, it stops blindness
[1:12:28] <+jjjccc19> ems is only to prevent blindness and make your ms more powerful
[1:12:29] <spawnzie> does it have to be a loved one for eternal?
[1:12:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus To get Mangekyou, you have to see your best friend die. To get eternal mangekyou, you take your brother's mangekyou
[1:12:32] <NiktenKing> Yes and no
[1:12:36] <Sedrelic> woolie...stop
[1:12:38] <tookool5678> some powers are transferred.
[1:12:38] <Pat_Squared> Mangekyou is triggered through loss. Eternal is from brother
[1:12:38] <Shishi1205> Not really
[1:12:39] <biomegabear> kishimoto is a shit writer
[1:12:42] <%LeaIsChill> NotLikeThis
[1:12:43] <+Chronobot> SHHHH, CONSUME PRODUCT
[1:12:45] <NeoPockeyG> You need to take another mangekyo to gain eternal
[1:12:46] <WanderingSwordsman> @menitta he got his eye from Obito
[1:12:49] <Solidnick18> idk
[1:12:50] <+jjjccc19> eyeballs do matter
[1:12:50] <lunacys_straightjacket> woolie fuck me!! just please watch the show
[1:12:52] <MyNameIsRasus> It's inconsistent
[1:12:53] <Shishi1205> But Shishuis eyes were used alone
[1:12:54] <@Menitta> woolieWUT
[1:12:59] <Arblaster_> Kishimoto forgot
[1:12:59] <@Solidus_113> SHARINGAN IS DUMB
[1:13:01] <Shishi1205> they were not implanted in other eyes
[1:13:01] <joylent_blue> trauma based Mangekyo without taking eyes makes you eventually go blind ye
[1:13:04] <jonathandemel> Aaaaaanimeeeee
[1:13:06] <+MrRabbles> Mangekyo is Loss
[1:13:09] <dundore77> if you take the eye and morph them into eternal you dont get the ability if you swap the eye out completely then its the ability
[1:13:09] <RICE02> The Uchihas just want that Bloodborne insight. Grant us Eyes
[1:13:13] <%Lion_kun> Sharingan is the fucking worst.
[1:13:15] <%hitorio> Naruto is just what happens when you freestyle with no destination in mind.
[1:13:19] <Morning_Asakura> stop trying to make sense of nonsense
[1:13:19] <Arek_1> The specifics aren't revealed. There's a theory that the MS of brothers are fused.
[1:13:19] <+jjjccc19> rinne sharingan is the coolest though
[1:13:22] <+NiSoKr> Shisui's eyes were just solo. If shisui had a brother with magnekyo who took his eyes he woouldn't get his power
[1:13:27] <Shishi1205> yours
[1:13:28] <rheviel> no
[1:13:28] <biomegabear> Does that work if you have a byakugan eye and take another ones eye?
[1:13:31] <Iggeh0> dear god
[1:13:32] <%LeaIsChill> Kakashi does have Mangekyou Woolie
[1:13:32] <%hitorio> Kishimoto has a new series out about samurai
[1:13:34] <jonathandemel> @WoolieVersus Hypothetical, hasn't come up
[1:13:35] <Iggeh0> please just play the game Woolie
[1:13:37] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Its inconsistent
[1:13:39] <+thatfig> this is why i read One Piece
[1:13:39] <NinjaGentleman> they amplify sasuke's abilities cause his ability overwrites it cause Uchiha blood. since other people don't have Uchiha blood the original ability is still in place @WoolieVersus
[1:13:41] <+kewlmyc> Minh is suffering
[1:13:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MIHNPOCALYPSE
[1:13:47] <%VidulaSaix> It will because Kakashi has an eye using an ability and he is not an Uchiha
[1:13:50] <biomegabear> JUST READ CHAT FOR ANSWER
[1:13:51] <djazo> LUL
[1:13:53] <Shishi1205> Kishimoto wrote out of his ass
[1:13:54] <%Lion_kun> BECAUSE ARSKI FORGOT
[1:13:54] <StormKingLD> its triggered
[1:13:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus You both have to have the first step first
[1:13:55] <%TheDyingPride> The worst part is just that some of these scenarios just didn't happen
[1:13:55] <%gatorafan> Hatred makes you powerful Minh :)
[1:13:56] <@Menitta> How did Kakashi get it tho
[1:13:56] <Andrei11Droasca> I hope i didn't miss any stupid shit
[1:14:02] <Iggeh0> Sharingan shit comes up later
[1:14:04] <Dragon_Batman> It's complicated because it never really got sat down and thought about 100%
[1:14:05] <%Lion_kun> ARAKI
[1:14:07] <BearSawed> Its a plot hole move on!
[1:14:07] <biomegabear> CHAT WILL EXPLAIN
[1:14:07] <MyNameIsRasus> @Andrei11Droasca missed some edge
[1:14:08] <%LeaIsChill> Kakashi stabbed someone to get Mangekyou
[1:14:08] <jonathandemel> @biomegabear They can't acknowledge the chat
[1:14:08] <+LordAlexGram> i'll come up later guy
[1:14:12] <%hitorio> Woolie's questions are the would-be forum topics... if he had been into Naruto off-cam
[1:14:14] <NiktenKing> If you wanna use mangekyo.... you can use someone elses eyes, but they will fade. You need to unlock it yourself and have their eyes if you want it to be eternal
[1:14:19] <+LordAlexGram> it'll
[1:14:19] <biomegabear> @jonathandemel T_T
[1:14:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Your own stand
[1:14:21] <mankeymania> monkeygo
[1:14:21] <dundore77> its not a plot hole. its just something that never comes up
[1:14:21] <@Solidus_113> @Menitta spoilers for later
[1:14:26] <Ultimatefool> Come on over to the NARUTO CLASSROOM
[1:14:29] <@Menitta> ah gotcha
[1:14:31] <nothuzad> the eyes of somebody close
[1:14:34] <+NiSoKr> Yes!
[1:14:34] <StormKingLD> its triggered by emotional loss not physical
[1:14:34] <zk_nails> you don't watch Naruto to think, Woolie
[1:14:41] <NinjaGentleman> its not a plot hole its just confusing
[1:14:47] <@Menitta> also wtf you can highlight messages now
[1:14:49] <jonathandemel> @biomegabear I don't make the rules
[1:14:51] <jonathandemel> lol
[1:14:54] <+kewlmyc> He wants to fully understand everything, but not read the manga. lol
[1:14:54] <@Solidus_113> channel points
[1:14:55] <+NiSoKr> No you don't get their abilities
[1:15:00] <%VidulaSaix> You do
[1:15:02] <NinjaGentleman> NOPE
[1:15:03] <+jjjccc19> you do
[1:15:04] <@Menitta> neat
[1:15:05] <%VidulaSaix> That was Danzos entire deal
[1:15:06] <jonathandemel> You do
[1:15:07] <%VidulaSaix> Yes you do
[1:15:07] <MyNameIsRasus> 3
[1:15:08] <%jinking79> we'll just gonna wiki this shit
[1:15:09] <biomegabear> @jonathandemel I understand its not your fault.
[1:15:09] <NiktenKing> You do
[1:15:10] <dundore77> the mangekyo needs to see the death of a loved one. the eternal mangekyo is you have to take a sibling's eyes who ALSo has mangekyo but you dont get their abilities.
[1:15:11] <+jjjccc19> to a certain extent
[1:15:11] <rheviel> Loss is for YOUR eye. if you use another person's eyes it won't have mangekyo, cause it was YOURS that awakened.
[1:15:11] <%gatorafan> oh no.... chat fight
[1:15:12] <Shishi1205> Do you get their abilities?
[1:15:12] <NinjaGentleman> Not if you are a uchiha
[1:15:16] <Shishi1205> Is that confirmed?
[1:15:17] <rubbishbinge> Gotta take a relative's eyes
[1:15:20] <jonathandemel> @biomegabear Just joshing, it's fine man
[1:15:21] <Solidnick18> NotLikeThis
[1:15:21] <rubbishbinge> Naaaaah
[1:15:24] <+NiSoKr> Sasuke NEVER USES Tsukiyomi he doesn't have it
[1:15:27] <NinjaGentleman> if you some rando like Kakashi or danzo then he's right
[1:15:34] <Jaxnos> nope, doesn't have to be a relative. kakashi.
[1:15:34] <jonathandemel> @NiSoKr Madara
[1:15:35] <djazo> whaaaa???
[1:15:36] <Arek_1> Specifically, EMS requires a strong bond. E.g., brothers.
[1:15:39] <%lordsdb> Wait but did Sauske ever use Itachi turn inti birds thing? Cause if not then no.
[1:15:40] <NinjaGentleman> if you are a Uchiha you overwrite them with your abilities
[1:15:40] <biomegabear> Woolie should tweet out these questions
[1:15:42] <%Irridium> wait why does a rando get the abilities but an uchiha doesn't
[1:15:49] <Shishi1205> because shishuis eyes were not implanted in other eye sockets, the crow had one remember?
[1:15:51] <contrope> @rubbishbinge He does thou
[1:15:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[1:15:53] <NiktenKing> Stealing Shisui's eyes gives you his unique abiliity of Kotoamatsukami, the best genjutsu
[1:15:53] <Pat_Squared> I don't think you get their abilities because we don't see him using itachi's specific abilities
[1:15:54] <+Bluydee> @lordsdb that's just something Itachi does
[1:15:57] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @NiSoKr your missing the point, woolz is just asking how it works
[1:16:00] <%VidulaSaix> Kakashi existing as a character completely answers this question Woolie. He has an ability.
[1:16:04] <wotebi> sasuke does have tsukiyomi, he just isn't skilled enough in time manipulation
[1:16:09] <%hitorio> Can an Uchiha awaken the sharingan if their favorite anime ship sinks?
[1:16:18] <jonathandemel> @WoolieVersus Just think of Kakashi, he has a Mangekyo
[1:16:19] <%VidulaSaix> And yeah Sasuke absolutely has Tsukuyomi
[1:16:20] <tookool5678> some powers are transferred.
[1:16:21] <NinjaGentleman> yes
[1:16:24] <BearSawed> Amatarasu is itachis power but sasuke can use it
[1:16:32] <+NiSoKr> Sasuke absolutely does not have tsukiyomi
[1:16:35] <Shishi1205> keke genkai
[1:16:37] <+Manderson1998> Took ages but I just finally beat all the events on the timeline myself
[1:16:38] <+Superbro64> I miss hxh NotLikeThis
[1:16:38] <Arek_1> @lordsdb The crows thing is just Itachi's flair when using genjutsu.
[1:16:38] <%VidulaSaix> Yes he does
[1:16:39] <Pat_Squared> Sasuke doesn't get the like upgraded Susanoo with the sealing sword and shit
[1:16:42] <Sp3ctre48> Eye powers are stupid
[1:16:43] <+LordAlexGram> like kakashi
[1:16:45] <jonathandemel> @NiSoKr He uses it against Killer Bee
[1:16:45] <biomegabear> pepe genkai
[1:16:48] <Shishi1205> but sasukes eyes are ruined
[1:16:49] <%lordsdb> gotcha chat
[1:16:50] <NinjaGentleman> some people get abilities some don't its really fucking dumb
[1:16:53] <joylent_blue> does Kakashi experience sight loss at all i don't remember
[1:16:57] <wotebi> sasuke uses tsukiyomi when he fights raikage
[1:16:57] <%Irridium> so he does and doesn't. got it
[1:16:57] <lonlono> NotLikeThis
[1:16:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't know if Sasuke's eyes have a special ability
[1:16:59] <+kyh9> It's not complicated: it makes no sense
[1:17:01] <Psyramics> This shit is dumb and not worth stressing about
[1:17:02] <Sedrelic> perfect
[1:17:05] <spawnzie> Think about Kakashi and his mangekyou
[1:17:05] <rheviel> yes
[1:17:06] <jonathandemel> It doesn't stack
[1:17:06] <Iggeh0> @joylent_blue yes he does
[1:17:07] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[1:17:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FailFish
[1:17:10] <NinjaGentleman> sasuke blinded himself like a dumbass after the kage summit
[1:17:11] <@Solidus_113> Don't spoil the kakashi stuff
[1:17:11] <%Killah772> Killah772 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:17:11] <WanderingSwordsman> @joylent_blue he does but its a spoiler
[1:17:11] <jonathandemel> It DOES NOT stack
[1:17:12] <Bloodxb> strike also just doesnt have tsukoyomi
[1:17:12] <Malikwest11> no
[1:17:13] <Solidnick18> eyeball fight
[1:17:13] <+LordAlexGram> yes
[1:17:14] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think it does
[1:17:14] <Shishi1205> it shouldnt stack
[1:17:18] <+texflexrex> we don't know about stealing EMS
[1:17:19] <lonlono> the buffs dont stack
[1:17:20] <@Menitta> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:17:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Woolie loves dumb tho
[1:17:20] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @optimasmaximas
[1:17:21] <+omenzazu> no stacks
[1:17:22] <Arek_1> No.
[1:17:22] <R3c0n31> It might as well stack at this point
[1:17:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MY HEAAAAD
[1:17:23] <biomegabear> it should but doesnt
[1:17:24] <Sp3ctre48> Kakashi should have the eternal one shouldnt he?
[1:17:24] <NinjaGentleman> THEY DONT STACK
[1:17:25] <djazo> but how does king crimson works?
[1:17:25] <+TopTieramisu> RECYCLING EYES?
[1:17:26] <joylent_blue> WanderingSwordsman hmmm gotcha
[1:17:27] <MutedMimic> uhnHead
[1:17:28] <jonathandemel> NO
[1:17:29] <TheWashoutXY> Even chat isin't clear on this LUL
[1:17:29] <%hitorio> Kishimoto wasn't thinking in terms of game design. :O
[1:17:29] <BustRobot> The solution to this is TO STOP THINKING ABOUT IT! FrankerZ
[1:17:30] <%VidulaSaix> If you're talented enough to access the techniques then yes you cvan use it
[1:17:33] <MyNameIsRasus> Doesn't stack
[1:17:34] <rubbishbinge> I think it's chakra nonsense. Sasuke's personal mangekyo stuff is Blaze style.
[1:17:35] <metaloverlordx> tsuki is gone accept it!
[1:17:35] <+rocketopaunch> KAKASHI
[1:17:37] <Pat_Squared> you only get one sharingan implant/fusion
[1:17:38] <thexiiilightning> The vomit conversation made more sense
[1:17:38] <RICE02> Nah it resets with every patch Kappa
[1:17:38] <Bloodxb> doesn't
[1:17:39] <Dragon_Batman> If you think about it like that, Danzo would have been broken
[1:17:39] <rheviel> NO STACK
[1:17:40] <alwayspronking> I don't like this RECYCLING EYES shit
[1:17:40] <+NiSoKr> Sasuke doesn't have Tsukiyomi kishimoto is just not very clear and people mistake generic sharingan abilites for it all the time
[1:17:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Go all in on dumb
[1:17:42] <%LeaIsChill> It never happens but Kakashi got it
[1:17:42] <Sp3ctre48> No one is clear on it, it's fucking dumb NotLikeThis
[1:17:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IS THIS HOW IT ENDS
[1:17:44] <jonathandemel> Because they're Itachi's eyes, his chakra
[1:17:44] <tookool5678> Kakashi eye been transferred so no blindness.
[1:17:44] <+TopTieramisu> king crimson is far more grounded than gold experience
[1:17:47] <Shishi1205> WHICH ITACHI ability did they retain???
[1:17:48] <BearSawed> Its never been transfered more than 2 times in the series
[1:17:49] <%hkarim94> This is Woolie MO
[1:17:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[1:17:50] <Ultimatefool> Woolie, not even Kishimoto thought this hard about the character's dumb powers
[1:17:51] <optimasmaximas> @Pat_Squared each susanoo is unique to the user, so sasuke wouldn't get itachis anyway
[1:17:51] <+Bluydee> I think Tsukuyomi is just Itachi's personal technique of how good he is at genjutsu, since in the fight against Danzo Danzo mentions Sasuke's using the same Sharingan genjutsu but is worse
[1:17:53] <+leerocku> Sasuke = Amaterasu Itachi = Susanoo Sasuke has both if he takes Itachi's eyes
[1:17:54] <Malikwest11> this comes up and yes it does
[1:17:55] <aracon_> they don't stack, but the more advanced eyes basically have better versions of old eyes plus new ones
[1:17:55] <%VidulaSaix> Chat is just forgetting things happened and basing things off that
[1:17:56] <%hkarim94> he loves this type of stuff
[1:17:57] <Prevot> REC-EYE-CLYING
[1:18:00] <jonathandemel> @WoolieVersus Tsukuyomi vs Killer Bee
[1:18:00] <NiktenKing> Except Amaterasu
[1:18:00] <%VidulaSaix> Minh, he uses Amterasu all the time
[1:18:01] <NinjaGentleman> They just both had Amaterasu cause they were brothers and had similar abilites @WoolieVersus
[1:18:03] <+texflexrex> Amaterasu is an itachi ability no?
[1:18:04] <%jinking79> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[1:18:07] <Andrei11Droasca> Woolie thinks the sharingan is some SBR stand ,wen it's just whatever the fuck the writer wants it to be LUL
[1:18:10] <@Solidus_113> How does the Eternal Mangekyo King Crimson work???
[1:18:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Inzanagi isn't Shisui's tho
[1:18:12] <optimasmaximas> @texflexrex yes
[1:18:15] <MessyBristles> no its more that the person who takes the eye now has the ability to learn an eye ability
[1:18:16] <%hitorio> If the Naruto world was a fighting game, people would be doing infinites and touch-of-deaths day 1
[1:18:18] <Sp3ctre48> Itachi gave Sasuke Ameterasu
[1:18:20] <Dragon_Batman> Shisui was in the crow
[1:18:20] <jonathandemel> What?
[1:18:22] <jonathandemel> Nononono
[1:18:23] <lunacys_straightjacket> izanagi isn't anyone's ability
[1:18:24] <thexiiilightning> It's not tho!
[1:18:24] <Shishi1205> The crow is shisuis
[1:18:25] <+TopTieramisu> sharingan is whatever kishimoto wants
[1:18:26] <NinjaGentleman> no tsukyomi genjutsu was itachi ability @texflexrex
[1:18:27] <jonathandemel> It's just a jutsu
[1:18:29] <joylent_blue> IT. JUST. WORKS.
[1:18:31] <Bakefowl> No
[1:18:34] <+JacknZack27> Christ I dont know anymore
[1:18:37] <Arek_1> Itachi's specific set of MS jutsus are lost forever with his eyes being taken by Sasuke.
[1:18:37] <+fateirony> sharingan becomes one for all
[1:18:38] <BearSawed> @Solidus_113 Its lag, weve already established this
[1:18:39] <lonlono> amaterasu is sasuke's family ability there solved it
[1:18:41] <Iggeh0> it can't be explained to him without spoiling
[1:18:42] <jonathandemel> The CROW is not the ability, the crow had SHISUI'S EYE
[1:18:42] <+kewlmyc> JUST WIKI IT
[1:18:43] <+thatfig> how do people defend Naruto
[1:18:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Izanagi is generic, the crow isn't Shisui's
[1:18:44] <%hitorio> Tsukuyomi is a move exclusive to the Mangekyo's right eye and Amaterasu was an ability of the Mangekyo's left.. or the other way around
[1:18:44] <NinjaGentleman> it was his other eye
[1:18:44] <thexiiilightning> The crow was Itachi's, he just implanted the eye on it
[1:18:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Eventually it doesn't even matter anytmore
[1:18:49] <lunacys_straightjacket> WIKI IT
[1:18:51] <%VidulaSaix> Yeah dont worry about this shit
[1:18:51] <+NiSoKr> Sasuke has Amaterasu and Flame Control. Itachi has Amaterasu and Tsukiyomi. Shishui has Kotoamatsukami x2
[1:18:51] <metaloverlordx> crow = shisui
[1:18:52] <%VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:18:52] <rheviel> Izanagi is anybody
[1:18:53] <Dragon_Batman> one of shisui's eye is danzo and the other eye is crow
[1:18:53] <MyNameIsRasus> MINH, READ THE WIKI
[1:18:54] <+leerocku> I thought Susanoo is Itachi's
[1:18:54] <NiktenKing> Shisui eye's were implanted into crow so that it would manipulate Sasuke
[1:18:54] <Shishi1205> ???
[1:18:57] <NinjaGentleman> he left 1 eye for danzo and gave the other to itachi @WoolieVersus
[1:18:57] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:18:57] <%Irridium> wait what
[1:19:00] <Prevot> uuhhhh
[1:19:01] <@Solidus_113> VIDEO GAMES
[1:19:04] <%gatorafan> I hate this woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:19:04] <jonathandemel> AAAANIMEEEE
[1:19:04] <dundore77> The difference is the eternal mangekyo iirc fuses the eyes into one. if itachi took out his eye and put shisui's eye into the socket he gets shisui eye powers but not eternal since shisui isn't his brother
[1:19:04] <@Menitta> WTF
[1:19:05] <Sp3ctre48> thatfig it's dumb but occasionally fun to talk about
[1:19:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SEX CHAKRA DOLL
[1:19:05] <joylent_blue> ...... OKAY?
[1:19:08] <+TopTieramisu> considering how much woolie is obsessed with rules, HxH is so much up his alley
[1:19:08] <Atlas_Abe1> Sasuke and Itachi both have ameterasu, Itachi did not give it to sasuke. sharingan users can not give abilities to other users
[1:19:08] <saiyan24675> Didn’t Shusui give Itachi one of his eyes before dieing
[1:19:08] <+MrRabbles> what does it even mean
[1:19:09] <+LordAlexGram> just pull up the wiki
[1:19:10] <tookool5678> you can date the characters.

[1:21:23] <BearSawed> @VidulaSaix But if thats true danzo should have had itachi abilities, because he has the eye of his friend
[1:21:24] <NinjaGentleman> yes

[1:21:52] <+freezydude> JUST DO IT
[1:21:53] <%VidulaSaix> @BearSawed Having the ability and lacking the talent mattes. That's why it took Kakashi so long to be able to awaken Mangekyou
[1:21:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But you are Woolz
[1:21:58] <%This_is_Marco> yet Kappa
[1:22:01] <jonathandemel> The eyes possess the abilities, but if you yourself had an ability, you can use those too
[1:22:02] <+LordAlexGram> chill guys
[1:22:07] <Shishi1205> big spoilers
[1:22:07] <%gatorafan> Don't ask chat, we are all fighting each other
[1:22:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus To be fair, the eye powers shit is STUPID
[1:22:09] <Arek_1> @hitorio The line Itachi used was for himself. "I awakened Susanoo by awakening the Amaterasu in right eye, Tsukuyomi in left eye." The retcon is when Sasuke said "I awakened Susanoo by awakening the double Mangekyo, awakening a jutsu in each eye."
[1:22:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND
[1:22:12] <beno113> This Woolie's getting cuhrazy
[1:22:15] <Malikwest11> It does but since everyone died they can't do it

[1:22:21] <zayasu> monkaS
[1:22:22] <biomegabear> CHAT DO YOUR STUFF
[1:22:23] <Dragon_Batman> Kakashi kinda helps with the eye talk
[1:22:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LORE WAR STARTS NOOOW
[1:22:26] <Shishi1205> yes
[1:22:27] <%Irridium> bruh chat's going both ways on it we don't know shit
[1:22:27] <SummonerMagno> time to shine one guy
[1:22:29] <Solidnick18> do the thing chat
[1:22:30] <NarcissistCactus> stay free
[1:22:31] <Graxe_> Itachi was gonna use his own Shisui eye to make Sasuke not evil, but had to use it on himself to break Kabuto's resurrection control.
[1:22:31] <Prevot> chat doesn't know shit
[1:22:33] <+Superbro64> naruto is bringing chat together ~~
[1:22:35] <jonathandemel> NONO
[1:22:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> WOOLIE IS BACK IN
[1:22:36] <flipperdee> danzo could only use shisuis eyes because of the harshirama cells
[1:22:36] <+Manderson1998> @WoolieVersus GET BENTO AT CLOUD VILLAGE. MAKE IT EASIER ON YOURSELF
[1:22:37] <+NiSoKr> Itachi doesn't have the eye in his head though
[1:22:40] <BearSawed> Its super unclear
[1:22:45] <CozyGUNNA> woolie get healing items
[1:22:50] <Shishi1205> itachi implanted the eye on the crow
[1:22:52] <+freezydude> THE SHISUI EYE IS IN THE CROW
[1:22:52] <shadowsofpain> So Sharingans are weird. As for your question if that eyeball has a ab
[1:22:52] <%hitorio> @Arek_1 :(
[1:22:54] <rubbishbinge> Kakashi doesn't have Uchiha chakra to interfere with the Obito's ability maybe.
[1:22:54] <flipperdee> Itatch kept it in a crow somehow
[1:22:55] <thealternatefellow> My brain hurts
[1:22:56] <%VidulaSaix> Kakashi existing as a character completely answers this question Woolie. He has an ability that is not his own which implies that transferring the eye to someone who has no ability can use it once they are able to train themselves to be able to use it
[1:22:56] <tookool5678> the eye was in the crow
[1:22:58] <jonathandemel> No

[1:23:03] <biomegabear> @sonofthedeepsouth he's been back in sience the previous game stream started
[1:23:04] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> woolieDATTEBAYO_BW woolieDATTEBAYO_BW woolieDATTEBAYO_BW woolieDATTEBAYO_BW
[1:23:07] <NinjaGentleman> no it doesn't stack
[1:23:08] <+NiSoKr> Itachi didn't implant the eye it's in the crow
[1:23:08] <dundore77> You only gain eternal sharingan from taking a brothers eyes.
[1:23:08] <jonathandemel> And Itachi never implanted Shisui's eyes
[1:23:09] <Malikwest11> the crow has te eye not Itachi
[1:23:13] <Graxe_> Itachi never put Shisui's eye in himself
[1:23:13] <thexiiilightning> Yes, but Shisui's ability is one use
[1:23:15] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus The Shisui eye is in the crow, remember
[1:23:15] <SteinsApprentice> would give you dope genjitsu from itachi but not shisui
[1:23:16] <optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus minh the crow is not shisui, it's itachi's; itachi just stuck shisui's eyeball into a crow
[1:23:16] <+andy199620> this is just a confusing question
[1:23:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NINJA EYE MAGIC. THE END LUL
[1:23:18] <danknugglit> "don't think about it"
[1:23:18] <spawnzie> Kishimoto didn't specify
[1:23:18] <Pat_Squared> it does not stack as far as we know
[1:23:18] <$Noponiz> the crow isnt an ability, it LITERALLY has shisui's eyes iirc
[1:23:19] <+JacknZack27> No has both itatchi eyes
[1:23:19] <agenda23> Its just one of many plot holes. Not worth the mental energy to try to parse
[1:23:21] <+no_id_uh> No
[1:23:23] <Malikwest11> it does sttack it comes up later
[1:23:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> MAYBE
[1:23:24] <+bgbdbn98> you need a family members eye, doesn't have to be the person you killed
[1:23:26] <Atlas_Abe1> no if Sasuke took shisui's eye he would get shisui's power but not gain eternal mangekyo
[1:23:29] <Solidnick18> NotLikeThis
[1:23:29] <flipperdee> The abilities should be unique to tbe person but Shisui's an outlier
[1:23:30] <Graxe_> And he put that crow in Naruto
[1:23:31] <Shishi1205> yes
[1:23:32] <Dragon_Batman> Yes
[1:23:33] <jonathandemel> Yes
[1:23:33] <Graxe_> Yes
[1:23:33] <NarcissistCactus> kishimoto
[1:23:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOD
[1:23:34] <+texflexrex> yes
[1:23:34] <%TheDyingPride> yes
[1:23:34] <%Irridium> what
[1:23:35] <lunacys_straightjacket> yes
[1:23:35] <Arek_1> Yes.
[1:23:36] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[1:23:36] <+Vikken141> yes
[1:23:37] <Iggeh0> yes
[1:23:37] <Shishi1205> DONT ASK
[1:23:37] <tookool5678> yes
[1:23:37] <dundore77> yes
[1:23:38] <@Solidus_113> To break out of the reincarnation thing Kabuto did
[1:23:38] <+NiSoKr> Yes it's a physical crow with shisui's eye
[1:23:38] <Malikwest11> yup
[1:23:38] <MyNameIsRasus> YES
[1:23:39] <SteinsApprentice> yes
[1:23:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> now theres crow?!
[1:23:39] <austin9568> yes
[1:23:40] <Sapphire_Breeze> yes
[1:23:40] <thexiiilightning> yES
[1:23:40] <flipperdee> yes
[1:23:42] <Atlas_Abe1> YES
[1:23:42] <NiktenKing> Yes
[1:23:43] <+MassChaos23> yes
[1:23:44] <GuiserGestalt> all this eye removal and skullfuckery with one anothers eyes...
[1:23:44] <+GreenCMD> YES
[1:23:44] <%Irridium> ???
[1:23:45] <%TheDyingPride> The crow had the eye and the eye was in naruto
[1:23:45] <metaloverlordx> yes
[1:23:46] <TwinBat> Yes
[1:23:48] <Dragon_Batman> The crow looks into Itachi and it does a genjutsu on itachi
[1:23:49] <metaloverlordx> yes yes
[1:23:53] <rubbishbinge> Itachi's unique stuff is his Susano's sealing ability
[1:23:54] <biomegabear> Chat has a masters degree in shanrigan
[1:23:54] <+JacknZack27> Yeah
[1:23:54] <+Manderson1998> @WoolieVersus Before you start... GET BENTO AT CLOUD VILLAGE. MAKE IT EASIER ON YOURSELF. They have bento that boosts attack & defense
[1:23:55] <%jinking79> Yes
[1:23:55] <wotebi> thats why itachi killed the crow
[1:23:57] <spawnzie> The crows are real?
[1:23:57] <aracon_> sharingan crow hggWoke
[1:23:57] <Fart_Explosions> It doesn't stack. Each Mangekyo user has there own unique version of Susano only they can summon.
[1:23:58] <Jetsfantasy> That's an Uchiha crow
[1:23:59] <Andrei11Droasca> Just give up on this shit already and finish Jojolion Kappa @woolieversus
[1:24:00] <+JJ_automatic> yes he used shisui jutsu to free himself from reanimation
[1:24:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> why did Kishimoto do it like this?!
[1:24:01] <%hitorio> Kishimoto needs a Q&A corner about the mechanics of his world like the creator of One Piece does.
[1:24:02] <muniea3> but.... smaller
[1:24:02] <%ozzrabbit> Yea
[1:24:03] <Arek_1> That was a REAL crow.
[1:24:03] <+ggbhtg> Yes, then he burned the crow @woolieversus
[1:24:04] <optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus yes, the crow itachi put in sasuke; itachi explained this when he and nagato fought bee and naruto
[1:24:05] <BearSawed> Answer is kishimoto and consistency have a tenuous relationship with continuity
[1:24:05] <Pat_Squared> taking your brother's eyes SEEMS to just prevent your eyes from decaying and giving your sharingan a combined appearance of yours and your brothers
[1:24:07] <SteinsApprentice> BENTO
[1:24:08] <dundore77> its a crow that itachi used ninja magic to activate when itachi's eye is used on naruto
[1:24:08] <NinjaGentleman> if itachi had implanted shisui's eye into himself itachis ability would overwrite shisui's ability cause of his blood @WoolieVersus
[1:24:12] <jonathandemel> Yes
[1:24:13] <MyNameIsRasus> YES
[1:24:15] <rheviel> summoned crow
[1:24:15] <agenda23> Its a crow summon?
[1:24:15] <+NiSoKr> No you onlyu get your own
[1:24:16] <dundore77> You do not get the other persons abilities
[1:24:17] <Shishi1205> Itachi was going blind remember
[1:24:19] <Atlas_Abe1> no
[1:24:19] <flipperdee> NO
[1:24:22] <VanLynx> it is not safe to assume anything
[1:24:22] <+GreenCMD> You only have yours
[1:24:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> .....
[1:24:22] <Pat_Squared> he never uses any of itachi's specific abilities
[1:24:24] <Sp3ctre48> No you dont get their ability
[1:24:24] <%gatorafan> The crow had to witness its best friend did Kappa
[1:24:24] <Shishi1205> I dont think so
[1:24:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Crow with the Berkin Sharingan Eyeball
[1:24:24] <Sapphire_Breeze> I hate this
[1:24:26] <jonathandemel> IF YOU TAKE THEIR EYES
[1:24:26] <optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus sorry, *itachi put in naruto*
[1:24:27] <tookool5678> some are transferred.
[1:24:29] <flipperdee> Sasuke doesnt have infinite tsukiyomi
[1:24:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> EVEREYE CONTENT
[1:24:30] <Atlas_Abe1> you only have yours
[1:24:31] <Bloodxb> no you only get your own
[1:24:33] <+MassChaos23> no
[1:24:33] <Arek_1> You only get your abilities, period.
[1:24:34] <+LordAlexGram> No you get a ability not another
[1:24:34] <Angry_Ev1L> IS IT WRONG THO?
[1:24:39] <%TheDyingPride> you get whatever you were supposed to have naturally
[1:24:39] <spawnzie> You don't have to kill to take their eyes
[1:24:39] <rubbishbinge> Unique Mangekyo abilities are preserved if they're not transplanted into another Uchiha it seems
[1:24:40] <+RenzoTheLion> the eyes hold the power
[1:24:41] <+andy199620> I hate this to
[1:24:41] <RayCSmooth> the abilities are in the eyes
[1:24:43] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Sasuke never even TRIES
[1:24:43] <+MassChaos23> you unlock your own versions
[1:24:43] <Malikwest11> people are forgetting something that happens later!!
[1:24:44] <Atlas_Abe1> Sasuke does not have any of itachis abilities
[1:24:46] <$Noponiz> only non uchiha's can inherit abilities iirc
[1:24:48] <dundore77> The etnernal mangekyo just allows you to spam your skills forever without going blind
[1:24:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:24:50] <NinjaGentleman> You don't get their ability if you are a Uchiha if you are a normie you get their ability
[1:24:50] <R3c0n31> yes, through suffering
[1:24:50] <MessyBristles> No you get the ability to learn eye abilities
[1:24:51] <Shishi1205> if you use their eyes/dont implant them you can use them?
[1:24:53] <jonathandemel> But he has EVERY SINGLE ONE of Itachi's Mangekyo abilities
[1:24:54] <Sp3ctre48> Sasuke got amaterasu because Itachi gave it to ho, directly
[1:24:57] <+texflexrex> yes no itachi abilities with sasuke's EMS
[1:24:57] <BearSawed> Amatarusu is itachis ability Mihn
[1:25:03] <+NiSoKr> Eternal mangekyo is VERY SPECIFIC
[1:25:04] <RpgFoLife> Your eye patterns changes
[1:25:04] <Dragon_Batman> It seems like the main power of that eye gets transfered
[1:25:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Did Itachi even have a unique ability?
[1:25:09] <NinjaGentleman> if you are a Uchiha you get a upgrade of your ability
[1:25:10] <%jinking79> Two Uchihas have done this
[1:25:11] <Malikwest11> yes
[1:25:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I NOW KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT EYES TO BECOME AN EYE DOCTOR LUL
[1:25:11] <Psyramics> This shit is worse that Dragonball power level discussions
[1:25:12] <nothuzad> not being an uchiha
[1:25:12] <+Spoonsire> Spoonsire subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:25:14] <flipperdee> If sasuke took Tobis eye he wouldnt have gotten a new eye
[1:25:16] <%Lylliek> You can inherit, but only if you don't have the sharingan yet I think.
[1:25:17] <thexiiilightning> Amaterasu was Itachi's Mangekyo skill. Shisui had a one use, full mind control.
[1:25:19] <Bloodxb> amaterasu is not unique to itachi
[1:25:19] <+NiSoKr> Usually you just get their eye powers UNLESS you are getting eternal
[1:25:21] <tookool5678> Some are Transferred.
[1:25:22] <Morning_Asakura> Thanks for the HahaThink @spoonsire
[1:25:24] <Shishi1205> Shishuis are not implated in eyes sockets?
[1:25:25] <OldManDeckardCain> Mangekyo has 3 basic abilities. ama tsuki and susan. some users are just better at one of them like sasuke with his fancy ama skills and itachi with buff susan
[1:25:26] <+MrRabbles> it probably is inconsistent
[1:25:27] <Atlas_Abe1> tsukuyomi is Itachi specific ability
[1:25:28] <+Vikken141> Flame control is Sasuke original right? though itachi has the base line flame
[1:25:28] <GyroMcGee> we need an optometrist here
[1:25:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> EYES ON THE INSIDE
[1:25:30] <+texflexrex> amaterasu was tied to is non-eternal MS, it wasn't only itachi's
[1:25:32] <NinjaGentleman> @WoolieVersus Normies get the ability uchihas get upgrades
[1:25:32] <Arek_1> @jonathandemel Amaterasu is just a shared family MS jutsu. Sasuke doesn't have Tsukuyomi.
[1:25:33] <agenda23> Some ppl do like danzo getting shisuis ability, some don’t like sasuke not getting tsukuyomi. Its a plot hole
[1:25:34] <BearSawed> Who else has amatarasu?
[1:25:35] <+Bluydee> Sasuke uses Sharingan Genjutsu multiple times but never calls it Tsukuyomi, but Madara and Danzo compare it to that so you can presume Itachi's prowess of genjutsu is why his Tsukuyomi is distinct
[1:25:35] <Pat_Squared> all of the abilities that sasuke uses seem to be just generic mangekyo abilities honestly
[1:25:38] <+leerocku> Both Kakashi and Another character has Camui
[1:25:38] <skykingcrow> Depends on if you're a Uchiha
[1:25:38] <kozboz96> cause they werent put into uchihas
[1:25:40] <+MassChaos23> its the yeye itself
[1:25:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> NARUTO BLOODBORNE EYES
[1:25:44] <$Noponiz> @WoolieVersus uchiha cant take the abilities. Crow and danzo arent uchiha
[1:25:46] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @flipperdee
[1:25:47] <rubbishbinge> Sasuke has Blaze control, Itachi has Totsuka no Tsurugi
[1:25:52] <beno113> Hashirama

[1:27:02] <%ozzrabbit> Wether you can use the ability or not depends on if you are an Uchiha or not. If you are not an Uchiha, you only get the ability of the person you killed, if you’re an Uchiha, the eyes upgrade your own abilities.
[1:27:04] <Andrei11Droasca> MINH AT RISK

[1:27:13] <Dragon_Batman> The wood dude Yamato has em
[1:27:16] <NiktenKing> Kotoamatsukami can only be used like once a decade, you need massive amounts of chakra to use it
[1:27:17] <+JustCallTre> As words from jojo part 5, It just works.

[1:27:23] <spawnzie> Yamato has them
[1:27:24] <+leerocku> 2 Kamuis
[1:27:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hashirama Cells LUL
[1:27:24] <NinjaGentleman> Hashirama cells is for the woodstyle, it helps him be able to use Shisui's ability once a day rather than waiting a whole year to use it cause he isn't a Uchiha @WoolieVersus
[1:27:27] <@Solidus_113> Ninja Cells
[1:27:32] <MyNameIsRasus> Hashirama cells is basically Kishimoto's "Get out of jail free" card
[1:27:38] <%hitorio> Someone do the summoning jutsu on SwagKage
[1:27:42] <Graxe_> Goddamn Sharingan eyes and Hashirama cells
[1:27:43] <%Lylliek> Hashirama cells are a pre-shippuden concept right?
[1:27:46] <Puhff> A N I M E
[1:27:46] <Dragon_Batman> Cough cough Kakashi
[1:27:46] <Sp3ctre48> They're literally ninja nanomachines
[1:27:47] <%VidulaSaix> Hashirama Cells are Nanomachines
[1:27:48] <+NiSoKr> Sorry but no
[1:27:49] <Graxe_> Fuck, man
[1:27:51] <helidzz> No
[1:27:52] <+texflexrex> not really
[1:27:52] <+ggbhtg> Hashi tobito rama shama
[1:27:55] <kozboz96> no
[1:27:55] <shockmaster3> NO
[1:27:55] <+PhantomMiG> Nope
[1:27:56] <foghornleghorn55> nope
[1:27:56] <dundore77> incorrect. kakashi doesn't have hashi cells
[1:27:57] <StormKingLD> no they are not abilities as much as they are techniques thats why danzo could use them because he learned the technique
[1:27:57] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @freezydude
[1:27:57] <spawnzie> Here's a helpful tip @WoolieVersus the second Hokage DOESN'T MATTER
[1:28:01] <biomegabear> Dr. Gero had studied Hashirama cells for Cell
[1:28:02] <+JJ_automatic> NO NO NO
[1:28:02] <Shishi1205> he could use it but less often
[1:28:06] <+NiSoKr> REMEMBER Kakashi has Obito's eye
[1:28:06] <MyNameIsRasus> He didn't extract skills from the eye
[1:28:06] <+bgbdbn98> no, bonus power
[1:28:07] <+Superbro64> we need swagkage, madara fanboy, in here
[1:28:07] <+texflexrex> hashirama has nothing to do with using sharingan
[1:28:08] <helidzz> Wrong otherwise kakashi would not be able to use the mangekyo
[1:28:09] <thexiiilightning> Nope, they don't go together
[1:28:11] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Itachi's exclusive MS jutsu: Tsukuyomi and his style of Susanoo. Sasuke's exclusive MS jutsu: Kagutsuchi and his style of Susanoo. Amaterasu is a shared family MS jutsu.
[1:28:12] <%ozzrabbit> NO WOOLIE!
[1:28:12] <NinjaGentleman> Hashirama cells improve cooldowns and eyeball usages
[1:28:16] <thexiiilightning> because of wood style!
[1:28:17] <Andrei11Droasca> Hashiramas cells are just S cells Kappa
[1:28:18] <tookool5678> No
[1:28:18] <Shishi1205> no?
[1:28:20] <thexiiilightning> and regeneration!
[1:28:21] <+MrRabbles> Kakashi isn't even an uchiha but has sharingan abilities
[1:28:22] <+RenzoTheLion> the eyes have the power
[1:28:24] <Jetsfantasy> Kamui
[1:28:25] <+bgbdbn98> he likes wood
[1:28:26] <+NiSoKr> Hashirama cells lower cooldown
[1:28:26] <+leerocku> #irama Cells
[1:28:26] <%hitorio> Kamui
[1:28:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Kamui is not his, it's from the eye
[1:28:27] <%VidulaSaix> Kamui
[1:28:28] <lunacys_straightjacket> you can use it just a shit version and or not as long
[1:28:28] <dundore77> hashirama's cells allows danzo to use shisui's ability once a day
[1:28:28] <Shishi1205> its not HIS
[1:28:28] <Iggeh0> Danzo's ability, Izanagi, requires both Uchiha and Senju power
[1:28:29] <jonathandemel> Izanagi is UNIVERSAL, but requires Hashirama cells to boost
[1:28:29] <aracon_> kamui
[1:28:29] <rheviel> Nope, senju is separate from Uchiha

[1:28:34] <+JJ_automatic> NO he has kamui
[1:28:36] <+LordAlexGram> No eyes are the power, eyes are everything
[1:28:36] <Atlas_Abe1> HASHIRAMA CELLS IMPROVE COOLDOWN
[1:28:37] <spawnzie> Kakashi's Kamui is technically Obito's
[1:28:37] <Dragon_Batman> Kakashi isn't a uchiha
[1:28:37] <+JacknZack27> How can literally everything be wrong?! What is right?!
[1:28:37] <wotebi> its called spoiler :D
[1:28:38] <$trueherobappo> kamui
[1:28:40] <Graxe_> Non-Uchihas can use the Sharingan and Mangekyo, but it takes more out of them
[1:28:40] <flipperdee> Hashirama cells were for wood style and are required for IZANAGI
[1:28:40] <BearSawed> Awnser redacted due to (Spoilers)
[1:28:41] <CozyGUNNA> kamui
[1:28:42] <$Noponiz> Uchiha cant steal, but others can

[1:29:07] <BearSawed> Woolie doesnt just let things go
[1:29:08] <NiktenKing> Kotoamatsukami requires a shitton of chakra to charge... You could literally stop a whole army with it at once.
[1:29:09] <+andy199620> the kakashi shairgan is a spoiler
[1:29:12] <$trueherobappo> woolie when you get to thw 4th game they will explain how the sharingan works in more detail @woolieversus
[1:29:13] <+HyraFukit> I see, One weeb, One walking compendium, and one dude grooving. I am home.
[1:29:13] <NinjaGentleman> The cells aren't needed but they help improve the usage of the eyes on normies. Kakashi is just doing it raw @WoolieVersus
[1:29:16] <Sokumotanaka> @sonofthedeepsouth Hinat's trying but he keep playing
[1:29:16] <Dragon_Batman> The only thing to take from Kakashi is that he has an eye ability
[1:29:17] <%hkarim94> stop Woolz
[1:29:18] <+JacknZack27> We should move away
[1:29:26] <+Bluydee> NUNS 4 explains a lot of this

[1:29:31] <+LordAlexGram> Calm down chat
[1:29:31] <helidzz> Wrong
[1:29:31] <Shishi1205> If you are not an uchiha
[1:29:31] <dundore77> hashirama's cells allows danzo to use shisui's ability once a day
[1:29:32] <Jaxnos> the answer to this conundrum is spoiler LUL
[1:29:34] <Atlas_Abe1> no
[1:29:34] <powerprotoman> thats wrong
[1:29:34] <tookool5678> Some abilities
[1:29:36] <NiktenKing> WRONG
[1:29:36] <Andrei11Droasca> Kakashi is big spoilers
[1:29:36] <+GreenCMD> Not exhaustively explained but the idea is that you unlock the capacity, but if It's not your ability You absolutely suck with it. It's extemely hard to use and is weaker.
[1:29:38] <NarcissistCactus> oh boy
[1:29:39] <NinjaGentleman> WRONG
[1:29:41] <+TopTieramisu> gesundheit
[1:29:41] <BearSawed> Maybe
[1:29:42] <+leerocku> Kakashi "All my friends are dead" Hatake
[1:29:43] <+NiSoKr> The upgrade is only for EMS otherwise powers directly tie to eyeballs
[1:29:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also not everyone has unique abilities
[1:29:43] <Graxe_> Hashirama cells are their own entirely different thing
[1:29:44] <shockmaster3> hashirama cells combined with uchiha give yyou rennigan
[1:29:45] <MyNameIsRasus> Izanagi is not shisui's abilities
[1:29:46] <danknugglit> Don't think about it
[1:29:46] <spawnzie> Save it for 4
[1:29:46] <GyroMcGee> dont get into kakashis thing
[1:29:47] <shockmaster3> thats it
[1:29:48] <dundore77> hashirama's cell are are not required
[1:29:50] <flipperdee> Transfering to Uchiha to Icha gives you no buffs besides eternal
[1:29:50] <Bakefowl> Oh god
[1:29:50] <kozboz96> @WoolieVersus cause shusuis eyes werent put into uchias so they werent over written
[1:29:50] <helidzz> @WoolieVersus We can't answer this without going to spoiler
[1:29:51] <JetpackMcQuack> It will become clearer with Kakashi @WoolieVersus
[1:29:52] <Shishi1205> if you are an uchiha you get yours upgraded
[1:29:52] <+LordAlexGram> Walk away woolie
[1:29:52] <rheviel> The Sharingan is a fucking mess
[1:29:52] <NinjaGentleman> If you are a Uchiha its a upgrade
[1:29:53] <%gatorafan> This is dumb daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:29:55] <%VidulaSaix> Okay chat stop you're spoilin now
[1:29:56] <$trueherobappo> Save it for 4
[1:29:56] <GyroMcGee> it just works
[1:29:57] <%VidulaSaix> Look away Woolie
[1:29:58] <RayCSmooth> Less talk more do
[1:29:58] <BearSawed> Awnser is Shut up tho
[1:29:58] <Jetsfantasy> Just think of it as the transfer as removing the durability on the Sharingan
[1:29:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Anyone can do it Izanagi
[1:29:59] <Shishi1205> if not you can use their abilities
[1:30:00] <$Noponiz> You just gotta not be uchiha to steal the ability
[1:30:00] <jonathandemel> Izanagi is a universal jutsu for Uchiha
[1:30:00] <Arek_1> EMS always has the user's unique MS jutsus only.
[1:30:00] <joylent_blue> HARD SWERVES away from spoilers
[1:30:03] <+Dre_> If you get the eye you get the ability
[1:30:03] <+MrRabbles> its dumb magic bullshit don't think about it
[1:30:03] <SteinsApprentice> that is sort of right reggie
[1:30:08] <MessyBristles> hashirama cells have nothing to do with it iddk where minh got that
[1:30:09] <D3rrtyD4n> JUST DONT
[1:30:10] <SteinsApprentice> pretty much
[1:30:11] <wotebi> answer is keep goiong
[1:30:11] <flipperdee> transferring from uchia to non uchiha =power transfer
[1:30:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> BRING BACK LEGACY OF KAIN
[1:30:12] <+Chronobot> CONSUME DONT QUESTION
[1:30:12] <Psyramics> Don't think about it because its dumb
[1:30:13] <spawnzie> Erase your brain Woolie
[1:30:13] <tookool5678> cells with eyes give you six path powers
[1:30:15] <agenda23> Plot hole
[1:30:15] <%hitorio> Woolie will figure it out. Possibly - maybe.
[1:30:17] <Shishi1205> Izanami is shushuis
[1:30:17] <Dragon_Batman> It isn't really a thing that can be truly answered
[1:30:21] <dundore77> it just requires an empty eyeball socket to get the power. eternal mangekyo fuses the eyes into 1 eye its different than popping another eye in
[1:30:22] <rubbishbinge> Eternal Mangekyo just makes you not blind
[1:30:23] <rheviel> Hashirama has nothing to do with Uchiha right
[1:30:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It just gets dumber and dumber until it gets spoilers as fuck
[1:30:25] <+freezydude> Sharingan have universal abilities, and unique abilities. Izanami is shisuis.
[1:30:25] <Jaxnos> the answer requires spoilers. so we're done here.
[1:30:28] <NinjaGentleman> Normies get the abilitie Uchiha's get the upgrade of their own abilities with no stacks @WoolieVersus
[1:30:30] <jonathandemel> @Shishi1205 Shisui is Kotoamatsukami
[1:30:30] <lunacys_straightjacket> just leave the eye shit alone because it's directly ties to spoilers woolie!!
[1:30:32] <Shishi1205> or izanagi?
[1:30:39] <Malikwest11> it comes but only for literally one second
[1:30:40] <%VidulaSaix> Yep
[1:30:43] <+kyh9> Woolie, the answer is Kishimoto never thought about this shit
[1:30:44] <Jetsfantasy> Woolie's asking questions too early basically
[1:30:44] <Puhff> More importantly, how does this tie into the super smash crossover universe???
[1:30:52] <+NiSoKr> Shisui's unique is kotoamatsukami. Izanami comes later
[1:30:53] <+texflexrex> yeah eye shit is spoilers ultimately
[1:30:54] <biomegabear> Will NUNS4 answer that?
[1:30:58] <+JustCallTre> @puhff it just does
[1:30:59] <djazo> mom dad stop fighting :(
[1:31:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie, you're thinking about this more than Kishimoto ever did
[1:31:03] <+JustCallTre> :)
[1:31:06] <+kyh9> @biomegabear hahahahahahahahahaha
[1:31:06] <+MrRabbles> the rule is there are no rules :)
[1:31:09] <%VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus The answer is that this simply isn't a conversation that can reach a satisfactory conclusion where you are in the story right now
[1:31:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol it gets answered but it barely matters
[1:31:11] <mankeymania> (CHAKRA)
[1:31:13] <Dragon_Batman> Nuns 4 won't really answer it, Kakashi stuff shure
[1:31:14] <spawnzie> You should just do a big discussion at the end of 4
[1:31:14] <rheviel> Asking questions just pokes too many holes
[1:31:15] <Sp3ctre48> There are answers but a lot of them are just really stupif
[1:31:16] <kozboz96> maybe the game wasnt the best way to get the answers to these questions @WoolieVersus
[1:31:16] <+veraverse> Kishimoto forgot
[1:31:17] <%hitorio> @Puhff Kakashi's eye allows him to see into the Smash Bros Universe
[1:31:18] <biomegabear> @kyh9 so thats a hard no
[1:31:18] <+TopTieramisu> kishimoto's world building is spotty at best
[1:31:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[1:31:20] <Dragon_Batman> Pretty much
[1:31:21] <NinjaGentleman> anyone can do Izanagi but its stupid for you to do it cause you go blind immediately
[1:31:21] <aracon_> exactly
[1:31:21] <Shishi1205> TRUE LUL
[1:31:22] <MutedMimic> LUL
[1:31:22] <Andrei11Droasca> SO WE ACHIEVED NOTHING NotLikeThis
[1:31:23] <xxemo_jonxx> LUL
[1:31:23] <BearSawed> Yup
[1:31:23] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:31:24] <Graxe_> Basically
[1:31:25] <jonathandemel> @WoolieVersus Izanami and Izanagi are universal Uchiha jutsu that consume the eyes
[1:31:28] <dundore77> the way ive seen it is it just requires an empty eyeball socket to get the power. eternal mangekyo fuses the eyes into 1 eye its different than popping another eye in
[1:31:29] <Solidnick18> that's so true
[1:31:29] <aracon_> literally just stop thinking about it
[1:31:31] <powerprotoman> woolie your thinking too hard about the japanese wizards
[1:31:32] <%gatorafan> Sharingan rules: IT JUST WORKS!
[1:31:32] <jonathandemel> FUCK
[1:31:32] <+Lazy_Vagabond> how did dio get into the coffin
[1:31:32] <shadowsofpain> NUNS 4 will likely answer a big portion later
[1:31:33] <+Manderson1998> @WoolieVersus Before you start and for your sanity... GET BENTO AT CLOUD VILLAGE. MAKE IT EASIER ON YOURSELF. They have bento that boosts attack & defense
[1:31:38] <optimasmaximas> FAX LUL
[1:31:39] <JetpackMcQuack> But it's fun to explore
[1:31:40] <Graxe_> It's a bit like Stand powers
[1:31:43] <Graxe_> It just works
[1:31:44] <Shishi1205> so yeah kotoamatsukami was his specially huh
[1:31:50] <BearSawed> It just works
[1:31:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:31:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You people chuck Araki Forgot to King Crimson but would go on long paragraphs about Sharingan smh
[1:31:58] <powerprotoman> the emchancis are spoilers
[1:31:58] <%VidulaSaix> It's difficult to answer right now
[1:31:59] <foghornleghorn55> The rules are not consistent lol. Chakra is one of the most poorly explained power systems
[1:32:02] <+veraverse> Dio will show up in NUNS4
[1:32:06] <NinjaGentleman> it doesn't stack though
[1:32:07] <Sp3ctre48> I cant even answer that
[1:32:07] <lunacys_straightjacket> the mechanics leads to spoilers though because you won't get it
[1:32:07] <+freezydude> It just works.
[1:32:11] <Malikwest11> you will see it
[1:32:12] <NarcissistCactus> how does king crimson work
[1:32:15] <Graxe_> Remember how Gold Experience lost the ability to reflect all damage done to everything it gave life to?
[1:32:15] <BearSawed> Spoilers Vereverse
[1:32:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But how the eyes work is fucking spoilers
[1:32:17] <PrimeNeverproc> !uptime
[1:32:18] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 32 minutes
[1:32:21] <Dragon_Batman> It either has though around it and is explained in the future or it was never thought about as thoroughly
[1:32:27] <D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[1:32:28] <kozboz96> @WoolieVersus if uchiha then if given new eyes own power is boosted if not unchiha then gain implanted eye power
[1:32:29] <Bloodxb> the mechanics are also spoilers here
[1:32:29] <+NiSoKr> @WoolieVersus It's because there are very few examples of the stuff happening. EMS happens like twice ever
[1:32:31] <Dragon_Batman> has thought*
[1:32:39] <+MrRabbles> how does gold experience actually work tho
[1:32:41] <+JustCallTre> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli it’s the whole hate what popular YouTube hates type thing and not forming their own opinion
[1:32:45] <D3rrtyD4n> just tell him LUL
[1:32:45] <spawnzie> Yeah but JoJo means nothng when out of context
[1:32:46] <joylent_blue> my head hurts
[1:32:46] <%Lion_kun> Araki forgot
[1:32:47] <+freezydude> woolie, it just works.
[1:32:47] <+JJ_automatic> the answer you want woolie will spoil regardlss
[1:32:48] <Bakefowl> Sharingan requiem
[1:32:50] <austin9568> Za Warudo!
[1:32:57] <+Chronobot> the Crow was the only 4D moment in the series
[1:32:59] <%hitorio> Kage Bunshin is supposed to literally split your remaining chakra among entire other people... and this implication means Naruto has 1000000000000000000000x the chakra of a normal person
[1:33:03] <+veraverse> I, Naruto, have a dream
[1:33:05] <Shishi1205> oh yeah I remember the Izanami spamming uchichas that was funny
[1:33:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> All of this just suddenly leads to GUESS WHAT FUCKERS
[1:33:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Araki forgot to give you a brain bro Kappa
[1:33:08] <Graxe_> Mangekyo is just Sharingan Requiem
[1:33:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NO THERE ISNT LUL
[1:33:11] <kozboz96> @WoolieVersus if uchiha then if given new eyes own power is boosted if not unchiha then gain implanted eye power4
[1:33:15] <%hkarim94> part of this also stems from Naruto already being finished
[1:33:16] <BearSawed> Retcons, Retcons everywhere
[1:33:18] <%VidulaSaix> Which is fine, but because you're the one that's not in the know here we all have information that makes it difficult to have the discussion without spoiling
[1:33:19] <gunsrlove> The author didn't want you to think about the mechanics of this children's anime
[1:33:19] <JetpackMcQuack> This conversation would make much more sense if it were 2007
[1:33:20] <+JustCallTre> Listen, the sharingan is kingdom hearts. There you go.
[1:33:21] <NinjaGentleman> @WoolieVersus if you are a Uchiha you are stuck with your own ability, if you get someone else's eyes then you get a upgrade of your own ability if you are a normal person then you don't get a upgrade you just get their own ability
[1:33:22] <$trueherobappo> This is what happens when you just drop the anime for a certain amount of time.
[1:33:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And THEN GUESS WHAT AGAIN
[1:33:30] <%hkarim94> and Jojo being "on-going"
[1:33:34] <+GreenCMD> There kinda is but you have to assume some people just don't want to use some very OP abilities.

[1:33:56] <NinjaGentleman> this is becoming more complicated than it really is

[1:34:04] <dundore77> the eyes that got put into sasuke are itachi's. to get eternal mangekyo you have to take a brothers eyes who also has mangekyo. this only has ever happened twice in the history of uchiha
[1:34:04] <lunacys_straightjacket> @GreenCMD or just straight up can't

[1:37:46] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Trust me, the way most have digested this series (manga/anime), there was no confusion as to how MS and EMS worked.
[1:37:52] <Darkyello> hey woolie stop and play
[1:37:52] <NinjaGentleman> if you are a Uchiha you are stuck with your own ability, if you get someone else's eyes then you get a upgrade of your own ability if you are a normal person then you don't get a upgrade you just get their own ability

[1:38:37] <optimasmaximas> @trueherobappo *cool
[1:38:42] <dundore77> i don't think what woolie wants is really ever explained. since mangekyo is never traded only fused into eternal mangekyo which only happens twice in the entire history of naruto
[1:38:43] <Dragon_Batman> Itachi did mention to Naruto that he is going to stop the REanimation

[1:39:56] <@Solidus_113> This is the Full Burst
[1:40:08] <Arek_1> @dundore77 It's been explained. EMS has no shared jutsus. An EMS user always only has his own MS jutsus. Amaterasu is just a shared family MS jutsu.
[1:40:10] <%hitorio> @veraverse Naruto is a very nutritious lesson
[1:40:12] <Shishi1205> he was going blind btw

[1:41:38] <Sp3ctre48> Itachi is absolutely Kishimoto's husbando so that's probably true

[1:41:59] <biomegabear> Is this a flahsback fight?
[1:42:05] <Arek_1> @dundore77 That's never been tried as the Uchiha have long come to the conclusion that EMS requires strong bonds in the first place. E.g., brothers.
[1:42:06] <Andrei11Droasca> "The memes Boruto!"

[1:55:00] <NiktenKing> @AMstone776 It's more of a rhetorical question, cause he does have all their cells, but jeez what he could have gotten away with
[1:55:01] <jonathandemel> The assist tracks from what I remember
[1:55:04] <Bloodxb> kabuto basically MIn maxed himself with all the buffs
[1:55:07] <+CoronetChris> Naruto towards the end got confusing, but the fight scenes are clean.
[1:55:08] <Fart_Explosions> Kabuto has five health bars NotLikeThis
[1:55:14] <%VidulaSaix> It can be a tough fight if you play too aggressive

[2:01:26] <rubbishbinge> Noice
[2:01:27] <+CoronetChris> Yeyeyeyeye
[2:01:33] <centuronstar> He's beginning to believe
[2:01:34] <Jetsfantasy> @TheDyingPride Like me probably, putting hours into this fight
[2:01:37] <AMstone776> Last Battle Zero, Last Battle V: The Final Frontier, Last Battle VI: The Return.
[2:01:37] <tookool5678> thats good
[2:01:39] <mankeymania> Last battle 8: The final battle
[2:01:40] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Jaxnos Because chat, whether right or wrong, is always dumb.
[2:01:45] <jonathandemel> DO COMBO
[2:01:46] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @ManaSpurt
[2:01:52] <Jaxnos> but my main point is you're also chat
[2:01:52] <lunacys_straightjacket> @Sokumotanaka your saying that on how he fights in general not when it's universally him asking how to doge that attack and literally everyone has the same fucking answer,and even then he himself says yeah that's what i'm looking for so....
[2:01:56] <optimasmaximas> @sokumotanaka bro it’s not like chat is saying something different each time someone says something, it’s typically the same thing just being repeated so they can see it
[2:02:02] <thexiiilightning> HYPE!!
[2:02:03] <biomegabear> THE SAVIOR IS COMING
[2:02:03] <%VidulaSaix> Woolie The Untouchable
[2:02:04] <IsacDee> Yea @ManaSpurt don't post links
[2:02:19] <alephalpha> I'm just repeatimng stuff so they can see it
[2:02:20] <zayasu> this is harder than sekiros last boss Kappa
[2:02:21] <thexiiilightning> Woolie unlocked his Sharingan! He can see everything now
[2:02:22] <$trueherobappo> You got this woolie keep it up
[2:02:23] <%hitorio> I thought chat was just trying to give advice. Was there really an element of posturing to look superior as well?
[2:02:24] <jonathandemel> YES
[2:02:24] <%senoue> Woolie Will Figure It Out!
[2:02:27] <ManaSpurt> @IsacDee Stop PMing weird stuff
[2:02:28] <optimasmaximas> @sokumotanaka plus, this chat is generally pretty helpful and not trolly, so...yeah...
[2:02:28] <+Kiiper> the advice wasn't wrong, it was assuming he was dodging
[2:02:32] <Shishi1205> I just remembered kabutos backstory
[2:02:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BUDGET
[2:02:36] <Shishi1205> fuck me
[2:02:45] <Arek_1> Did Woolie watch the Edo Nagato fight?
[2:02:49] <%hitorio> CyberConnect My Devil Trigger
[2:02:51] <optimasmaximas> @manaspurt everything good? What are they sending you?
[2:02:57] <%VidulaSaix> Dodged into it LUL
[2:02:59] <ActingKing42> Is this a boss fight or an actual person?
[2:02:59] <Jaxnos> when you get corner boned

[2:03:00] <tookool5678> almost there

[2:03:07] <%VidulaSaix> Boss

[2:03:17] <joylent_blue> PogChamp ?
[2:03:19] <Andrei11Droasca> NINJAS
[2:03:20] <ManaSpurt> Can we get @IsacDee OUT OF HERE
[2:03:21] <wendigo172> I really like Kabuto’s backstory
[2:03:25] <%hitorio> @ActingKing42 all fights are CPU. Woolie's in this for the story; there are no online fights in this LP
[2:03:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You Didnt Win button
[2:03:36] <IsacDee> Lmao I'm not doing anything you idiot @ManaSpurt
[2:03:38] <aracon_> itachi just hacking
[2:03:41] <%hitorio> Kabuto's asshole: entered

[2:04:03] <Dragon_Batman> Don't stop
[2:04:05] <NarcissistCactus> chop off his horns like it's elfen lied
[2:04:15] <centuronstar> You're already in Groundhog Day Requiem
[2:04:15] <Sokumotanaka> @optimasmaximas Sure you do and I'm the pope
[2:04:19] <+Chronobot> plot I frames Kappa
[2:04:20] <tookool5678> almost there
[2:04:22] <Dragon_Batman> Noice

[2:04:46] <TheWashoutXY> !uptime
[2:04:46] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 4 minutes
[2:04:46] <StarlitStunner> stripGo
[2:04:47] <jonathandemel> That's Awakening
[2:04:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is the Dark Souls of anime games
[2:04:49] <@Solidus_113> He's a boss, and he's perma awakening
[2:04:50] <rubbishbinge> Progress was made
[2:04:50] <+ggbhtg> fuuuk
[2:04:50] <amused_platypus> you were doing well woolie
[2:04:51] <Jaxnos> we dream of an orange bar
[2:04:52] <Div_the_Penguin> oof
[2:04:55] <+kaiju7544> Woolie MANAGE YOUR SUBSTITUTIONS
[2:04:55] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Isn't this fight in Storm 4?
[2:04:56] <AMstone776> oh yeah reading it in the manga was confusing. Until the reveal.
[2:04:57] <%lordsdb> gotta land more supers
[2:04:58] <Solidnick18> he goes awakened he gets big buff
[2:04:59] <optimasmaximas> @manaspurt sometimes it can be changed to other words if the person is memeing, but that’s really what it means normally
[2:04:59] <ManaSpurt> Wow that's really weird of @IsacDee to ask me this
[2:05:00] <+deidriel> Change items to get more health potions
[2:05:00] <alephalpha> it seems like Kabuto's got this
[2:05:03] <%hitorio> This game's combat system vs Kill la Kill IF
[2:05:05] <monzy101> wake up Kimimaru to strong
[2:05:06] <aracon_> hooooo boy we're gonna be here a while
[2:05:07] <tookool5678> he dash cancel on you
[2:05:09] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @kaiju7544
[2:05:13] <+HyraFukit> Honestly, why dont we team with Kabuto?
[2:05:20] <Dragon_Batman> Should he use the super? He loses the support combos and has to build it up again.
[2:05:23] <+Kiiper> the 4 version of this fight is easier
[2:05:28] <joylent_blue> because Kabuto is smelly
[2:05:28] <AMstone776> @elfucilaneroiv no its not
[2:05:32] <plo135> in this storm game can you swap with assist charecter
[2:05:36] <@Solidus_113> The Support combo goes away after a while
[2:05:41] <optimasmaximas> @solidus_113 can you talk to @manaspurt ? I dont want to ask them personal stuff since im not a mod even thoigh i would like to help
[2:05:52] <Andrei11Droasca> Cant he flick the right stick to switch?
[2:05:54] <tookool5678> I would just spam supers and ultimates
[2:06:00] <Sokumotanaka> BTw during this battle Anko is still knocked out, her character arc being stolen by a deadman. XD
[2:06:05] <+NiSoKr> I think that's just storm 4 but I'm not sure
[2:06:08] <+Bluydee> you can't tag until 4
[2:06:12] <%hitorio> Anko got done so dirty
[2:06:14] <RayCSmooth> use your grabs and items
[2:06:16] <biomegabear> In the grand scheme of things, anything involving orochimaru and his guys are kinda nothing and didnt matter
[2:06:17] <plo135> oh ok
[2:06:28] <LuLz_Emissary> this looks stinky
[2:06:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Itachi watches Bird Up
[2:06:44] <BearSawed> Orochimaru is such a dissapointment
[2:06:52] <+ggbhtg> he doesnt have the bubble on his meter at the end, so Itachi shouldnt have tilt awakening
[2:06:53] <AMstone776> Itachi is in the Bird Squad.
[2:06:54] <optimasmaximas> Tru (mostly) LUL @biomegabear
[2:06:59] <Sokumotanaka> @hitorio she super did
[2:06:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:07:03] <biomegabear> Im thinking Orochimaru is the final boss but nm lol other shit
[2:07:07] <Jaxnos> birb squab
[2:07:17] <Velozity> can't you use your ultimate after sasuke hits them back to you
[2:07:19] <Arek_1> @biomegabear But because of the Sound Village, some cool jutsus were shown off.
[2:07:25] <%hitorio> Orochimaru is a villain I just wanted to be over with, honestly. The only things I like about him are Anko and his bomb-ass theme song in the anime
[2:07:26] <WanderingSwordsman> woolieYE
[2:07:31] <biomegabear> Yeah Arek you are right
[2:07:34] <tookool5678> almost there.
[2:07:40] <jonathandemel> lol you charged into it
[2:07:48] <Sokumotanaka> I'm mad shino didn't fight the spider guy
[2:07:49] <%VidulaSaix> Doing much better this time
[2:07:51] <+Chronobot> PS3 not liking the spiderman
[2:07:56] <+kaiju7544> You should be charging chakra after every knockdown
[2:07:58] <%VidulaSaix> Just gotta get past Tayuya phase
[2:08:04] <%hitorio> How unsatisfying is it to fight a guy who just rebirths from a snake no matter what you do?
[2:08:07] <+HyraFukit> This is one of the cooler basic jutsus
[2:08:09] <%VidulaSaix> YEYEY
[2:08:12] <Dragon_Batman> Noice
[2:08:12] <joylent_blue> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:08:13] <Andrei11Droasca> Just 3 more bars to go Kappa

[2:08:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:08:22] <Solidnick18> YEEEE
[2:08:24] <Arek_1> Shino peaked during the Chunin Exams. LUL
[2:08:26] <Jaxnos> reggie is doing his best to jinx it LUL
[2:08:31] <+ggbhtg> pixel pace LUL
[2:08:35] <@Solidus_113> You also get health back on each QTE
[2:08:40] <+Bluydee> IIRC Itachi's tilt makes him invincible
[2:08:47] <Sokumotanaka> CYBER CONNECT Kreygasm
[2:08:50] <RayCSmooth> @WoolieVersus don't forget your items
[2:08:51] <%VidulaSaix> TRADES
[2:08:54] <+berserkscarlett> Woolie is focused
[2:08:56] <WanderingSwordsman> This looks familiar hmm
[2:08:59] <+ClaudeMcGarren> dang cut the same horn again huh ResidentSleeper
[2:09:02] <dundore77> Shino peaked because he never does anything again because he's too strong and just wins. he's just below shikamaru in intelligence and has a more damaging moveset
[2:09:02] <jonathandemel> Nope
[2:09:08] <biomegabear> Shino I thought had the most variety in what he could do with bugs
[2:09:12] <Solidnick18> wtf
[2:09:14] <monzy101> Ge breaks guard that fast?
[2:09:17] <Dragon_Batman> He is a boss he gets em for free
[2:09:18] <+stef5949> This is the best he has done so far, he can do it.
[2:09:22] <%VidulaSaix> Almost there
[2:09:23] <jonathandemel> 2 2 2
[2:09:24] <%hitorio> Did Minh asked if "crows" were ever as cool as they were with Itachi?

[2:09:33] <+NiSoKr> He blocked the charge for you
[2:09:33] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio i mean when you think about it it’s also kinda like the tailed beasts cause the hosts dies eventually and they had to be resealed
[2:09:36] <Sp3ctre48> Good job sasuke
[2:09:39] <aracon_> hggShaq ?

[2:10:52] <Arblaster_> NotLikeThis Easy mode now selecteble
[2:10:53] <Jaxnos> kabuto has a lot of pent up energy from his daddy issues
[2:10:53] <rubbishbinge> We're not done yet
[2:10:54] <+fateirony> what a sadist
[2:10:55] <Psyramics> @optimasmaximas no, he has 5 health bars
[2:10:56] <Doodle_Taco> What a Mad Lad
[2:10:56] <AMstone776> Kabuto has no chill
[2:10:57] <MyNameIsRasus> Kabuto going to town with his Ninja Info Cards
[2:10:57] <%Lion_kun> Us live streamers get to watch the whole thing.
[2:10:58] <aracon_> that wall came at an angle
[2:10:58] <dundore77> why does itachi even have a life bar. he's a zombie
[2:10:59] <joylent_blue> now he's tired tho
[2:11:00] <+CoronetChris> He's stomping on your corpse
[2:11:01] <jonathandemel> But they're so slow
[2:11:01] <austin9568> Went Quan-Chi on you
[2:11:03] <%Exiliator> Kabuto has no chill
[2:11:03] <Andrei11Droasca> nope
[2:11:03] <Arek_1> IRL Izanagi. LUL
[2:11:03] <@Solidus_113> Should've eaten a defense bento at the start
[2:11:04] <%VidulaSaix> Yeah that phase is like the last gasp
[2:11:05] <+meowmeow7t> alright stop stream come back when you do it
[2:11:06] <centuronstar> The rocks were bullshit
[2:11:07] <helidzz> you had full bar of substitutions tho
[2:11:11] <Morning_Asakura> need bento
[2:11:11] <RayCSmooth> @WoolieVersus double tap x and hold for quick move to help get past the walls
[2:11:11] <Drakenstorm13> it looks like you can switch to sasuke by hitting r1 and l1
[2:11:12] <Frostydough1> just... go the other way
[2:11:14] <+Manderson1998> @WoolieVersus remember to usse your subsitutes
[2:11:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie will skip the obstacles in his path, so he can remain at the apex.
[2:11:15] <rubini98> You can substitute the walls man lmao
[2:11:30] <IsacDee> Just press square though
[2:11:39] <jonathandemel> Just Do Combo
[2:11:42] <+JacknZack27> I always appreciate advice of just do it good tho
[2:11:45] <optimasmaximas> @psyramics i know, i was qouting reggie and saying oof because it was wrong lol
[2:11:49] <facuvillamil> interrupt him with a super
[2:11:53] <BearSawed> Secret boss is bullshit? Story checkes out
[2:11:54] <+NiSoKr> Spam assist
[2:11:59] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You're being too aggressive. Kabuto will always beat your buttons
[2:11:59] <+Kiiper> Hitachi has garbage confirm range
[2:12:00] <alephalpha> would spamming supers jelp?
[2:12:07] <monzy101> the Kimimaru and stone wall hit boxes are weird...
[2:12:15] <%hitorio> @optimasmaximas I'm generally speaking about how unsatisfying Orochimaru is in terms of fight scenes. It's like fighting a boss that doesn't flinch. ...or winning a battle but it impacting nothing in the following cutscene
[2:12:18] <optimasmaximas> CHAT CHEAT CODES
[2:12:18] <Andrei11Droasca> I think he dosen't block enough
[2:12:18] <%VidulaSaix> That Kimimaro chest burster is such a pain in the ass
[2:12:19] <+Kiiper> itachi even
[2:12:22] <Dragon_Batman> The supers might just be blocked or teleported
[2:12:29] <+BurkeBigsby> This game is such hot ass.
[2:12:38] <+ggbhtg> Spam supers even they get blocked or countered?
[2:12:38] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> NINJAS
[2:12:38] <Solidnick18> start over
[2:12:38] <IsacDee> I'm pretty sure that kimono is making your character slower.
[2:12:40] <zenith0111> Woolie has to get good calebRage_RD calebRage_RD calebRage_RD calebRage_RD
[2:12:43] <biomegabear> Shino and tenten. Under rated unused characters
[2:12:44] <Arblaster_> Hey at least this feels like an accurate representation of the anime fight LUL
[2:12:44] <BearSawed> RIP run
[2:12:45] <DaikiWithDaShot> block a little more instead of always substituting
[2:12:47] <MyNameIsRasus> F
[2:12:50] <@Solidus_113> While you're charging, you could try covering yourself with Sasuke's support
[2:12:51] <BearSawed> Reset
[2:12:54] <centuronstar> Big F
[2:12:54] <+chesterr01> @optimasmaximas he had burnt through 2.5 bars which is half of all Kabuto's health, no?
[2:12:56] <tookool5678> just spam the super
[2:12:59] <%VidulaSaix> Thats automatic Solidus
[2:13:01] <%VidulaSaix> If hes orange
[2:13:03] <+NiSoKr> You can dash out to be safe
[2:13:08] <%VidulaSaix> Which you get by using support enough
[2:13:09] <monzy101> wooliePOYO
[2:13:17] <%VidulaSaix> Thats also what enabled the team up special
[2:13:21] <@Solidus_113> yeah but you need to use the support enough for that to activate
[2:13:22] <%hitorio> Oh, dope. Reggie's in chat
[2:13:23] <Dragon_Batman> Not a bad idea
[2:13:28] <dundore77> tenten is garbage her ability is something everyone can do and in some cases show better feats with it
[2:13:29] <AMstone776> Yo Woolie, Kabuto has advantage on his buttons. This is like Vanilla Sagat to you playing Dan but you HAVE to win.
[2:13:36] <Arek_1> Spam assist to build the Support Gauge to be able to deal more combo damage and gain access to Team Ultimate Jutsu.
[2:13:37] <biomegabear> planet bursting sharingan
[2:13:40] <Drakenstorm13> use the ultimate attack double tap triangle and press circle to do the big sosanoo thing
[2:13:40] <ManaSpurt> Why is Sauske's dad wearing a kimono?
[2:13:41] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio oh yeah i get you, i was just thinking of other examples because when you said that i thought about how common of a thing that is in media but then couldn’t think of even ONE specific example like that, so i used the tailed beasts instead
[2:13:44] <zenith0111> Basically this whole fighter is a button basher. MASH DAMN IT
[2:13:44] <+Lazy_Vagabond> why does it do so little damage
[2:13:45] <aracon_> just gotta make it as far as you can without using health items
[2:13:45] <alephalpha> spam assist for that super
[2:13:57] <danknugglit> That did less than half a bar?
[2:13:59] <Andrei11Droasca> @woolieversus Wen you glow red you can do the team up super
[2:14:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:14:04] <BearSawed> That grab range
[2:14:05] <tookool5678> spam range attacks like supers and charge from a distance.
[2:14:10] <$Chumblago13> !motivated
[2:14:10] <@Moobot> 538 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:14:12] <+NiSoKr> Not sure why he stopped using sasuke he used to be spamming him on cooldown
[2:14:16] <jonathandemel> Fuuuck
[2:14:18] <aracon_> like if you can get to 3 and a half bars of health with bento and stuff you should be good
[2:14:23] <Solidnick18> still fine for now
[2:14:29] <biomegabear> This is the revengence armstrong fight when he starts dashing back and forth
[2:14:32] <+CoronetChris> The thing I hate about this version of Kabuto's design is the placement of the snake. Why come out of his stomach and not like his back.
[2:14:41] <+ggbhtg> Sasuke was getting interrupted A LOT so...
[2:14:47] <jonathandemel> Ooh
[2:14:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU CAN BLOCK TOO
[2:14:50] <alephalpha> umbilical cord imagery I guess
[2:14:50] <oceanmatt> that shit hurts
[2:14:56] <zenith0111> This boss fight looks dumb
[2:15:00] <Solidnick18> oh he can just go into it after
[2:15:00] <+freezydude> @ggbhtg you could always just hitconfirm it tho
[2:15:01] <@Solidus_113> Cover your chakra charging with Sasuke's support attack
[2:15:02] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio i guess i couldve used palpatine being in the nee star wars as a better example; or even mentioned hashirama cells or mgs nanomachines because they convey the same exhaustive sentiment as orichimaru, my b
[2:15:03] <Solidnick18> wow
[2:15:06] <DaikiWithDaShot> please tell him to block
[2:15:10] <+BurkeBigsby> Can you block or teleport those rocks?
[2:15:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Block yes
[2:15:26] <NotDamare> damn
[2:15:30] <IsacDee> @optimasmaximas what's a nee?
[2:15:32] <jonathandemel> Honestly? These fights are great, but could use more checkpoints
[2:15:34] <biomegabear> Dont let him bite your dick
[2:15:36] <ledwin94> Woolie if you tilt the stick and press B you will turn into crows you cant take damage while in this state
[2:15:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Itachi wants you to be a patriot, Sasuke
[2:15:41] <%VidulaSaix> Checkpoints? You kidding?
[2:15:42] <Jane_Lo> who's voicing itachi?
[2:15:45] <%VidulaSaix> Get that weak shit outta here LUL
[2:15:50] <alephalpha> Woolie if you tilt the stick and press B you will turn into crows you cant take damage while in this state
[2:15:56] <DaikiWithDaShot> got a rhythm going let's go
[2:15:56] <Arek_1> @Jane_Lo Crispin Freeman.
[2:15:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dont you have patriotism for your country? I mean, hidden village?
[2:15:58] <joylent_blue> i think Crispin Freeman has been Itachi's VA
[2:15:58] <optimasmaximas> @chesterr01 i was making fun of what reggie said which was that they had gotten through half his health but it was only the first health bar that was half way done
[2:16:02] <%hitorio> @optimasmaximas all good :D You listing those examples conveyed our same-page-ness, too.
[2:16:02] <+BurkeBigsby> I remember Itachi crows being good. They even hit too, right?
[2:16:11] <AMstone776> Don't worry all of this will be fine.
[2:16:11] <Jane_Lo> @Arek_1 Thank you
[2:16:11] <+ggbhtg> is this crow thing fucking REAL chat?
[2:16:11] <MutedMimic> LUL
[2:16:18] <alephalpha> I have no I dead
[2:16:19] <oceanmatt> the active frames woolie
[2:16:20] <+ggbhtg> and not from storm 4?
[2:16:23] <tookool5678> these can heal you.
[2:16:27] <+chesterr01> @optimasmaximas I am Reggie.
[2:16:30] <austin9568> Don't get greedy
[2:16:33] <biomegabear> You can charge your chakra now! its all full of snake poison
[2:16:39] <Morning_Asakura> active hitbix
[2:16:40] <@Solidus_113> instead of dashing in after the spikes use shuriken
[2:16:45] <+JacknZack27> At least this song’s not bad
[2:16:46] <%VidulaSaix> Or fireball
[2:16:48] <Andrei11Droasca> Kabuto kinda looks like he got biggest BWC ever KappaPride
[2:16:49] <Dragon_Batman> The active frames are long
[2:16:51] <Arek_1> @ggbhtg The crow thing is Itachi's flair when using genjutsu.
[2:16:53] <optimasmaximas> @isacdee LUL meant new, but while i got your attention, you talking weird shot to mangaspurt or were they trolling
[2:16:53] <@Solidus_113> any ranged attack really
[2:16:55] <+chesterr01> @optimasmaximas right now, kabuto lost 2.5 out of 5 bars
[2:16:55] <zenith0111> @woolieversus There's a universal function that's a special move called a "tilt". You do it by flicking the stick and pressing attack.
[2:17:00] <%hitorio> Lol that "I am Reggie." DUN. DUN. DUNNNNN
[2:17:04] <+chesterr01> that's half
[2:17:07] <%generalve> does he have Regen health
[2:17:13] <rubbishbinge> No more potions tho
[2:17:17] <%generalve> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:17:22] <Solidnick18> rip this run
[2:17:26] <DaikiWithDaShot> @zenith0111 he's done it before but idk how much Itachi's would help here
[2:17:31] <Arek_1> Yeah, Itachi in particular has a good tilt attack.
[2:17:40] <+darquezsmith> roo7 We believe in woolie!
[2:17:41] <+BioHunter> just ult spam
[2:17:45] <%hitorio> How would SonicFox download this fight? evo19Think
[2:17:48] <+ggbhtg> Do yall know for sure what Itachi's tilt attack in Storm THREE, chat?
[2:17:49] <Jane_Lo> is this hard difficulty or that's just how game is?
[2:17:51] <%HarmlessCrow> Hot damn this fight seems SO MUCH harder than it needs to be
[2:17:52] <joylent_blue> Kabuto IS the perfect lifeform
[2:17:55] <%VidulaSaix> Its fine guys, he got close a few attempts ago
[2:17:57] <tookool5678> spam supers and ultras
[2:17:57] <IsacDee> @optimasmaximas Nah mangaspurt told me One Piece was the better manga and I said no and then basically he messages you pretty much
[2:17:59] <helidzz> crows I believe
[2:18:00] <AMstone776> the only way to add items is to stop this fight and redo from the BEGINNING.
[2:18:01] <optimasmaximas> @chesterr01 ah, my bad, i saw the green health bar and i think that was the first health bar for him so i just saw the irony in that
[2:18:01] <%VidulaSaix> Just needs to not choek a few spots
[2:18:02] <+Bluydee> it is definitely the crows for his tilt
[2:18:04] <alephalpha> soadvie that's floating around is spam sasuke for team super
[2:18:06] <AMstone776> that sucks tho
[2:18:10] <Arek_1> @ggbhtg It may be the crow dash strike again.
[2:18:11] <zenith0111> The end of this battle was a mindfuck LUL
[2:18:15] <alephalpha> use tilt attack with b for invul
[2:18:24] <DaikiWithDaShot> what's his tilt again?
[2:18:25] <+kaiju7544> Chakra dash cancel during the up combo in the air to extend combo
[2:18:25] <%HarmlessCrow> About to make a comeback LuL
[2:18:39] <%VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:18:40] <jonathandemel> He has this
[2:18:41] <%hitorio> @zenith0111 Kishimoto drew a happy little chart for his readers. :)
[2:18:44] <optimasmaximas> @chesterr01 if there’s more than one green then that’s my bad, im having a couple convos at once and trying to articulate myself properly in all of them so im not always looking at the screen
[2:18:44] <+CoronetChris> He is just spamming that shield
[2:18:46] <+NiSoKr> Blocking out bosses doesn't really work. Shield breaks super fast
[2:18:52] <%VidulaSaix> Hed have to redo the entire beginning
[2:18:53] <Arek_1> Or Edo Itachi's tilt attack might be a Susanoo hand strike.
[2:18:55] <%VidulaSaix> If he did that
[2:18:56] <Morning_Asakura> itachi's tilt might be useful
[2:18:58] <+BurkeBigsby> Someone needs to implant the crow attack into Woolie's mind via psychic link.
[2:19:04] <Dragon_Batman> He guard crushes like half way through his combo, don't know if it's worth it to block alot
[2:19:04] <rubbishbinge> Yeah, restock on potions
[2:19:10] <zenith0111> @hitorio "It was all a dream!"
[2:19:15] <sangi53> is woolie regretting his difficulty choises?
[2:19:16] <kiharakun> woolies main problem stems from his low level hero path, he has shit healing
[2:19:35] <DaikiWithDaShot> @nisokr you can't hold block the whole time but it helps to avoid a few attacks and dash away instead of wasting away substitutions
[2:19:35] <rheviel> would going to a store back out of all previous progress?
[2:19:41] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[2:19:44] <AMstone776> @zenith0111 kinda but it was still a cool reveal
[2:19:44] <optimasmaximas> @isacdee oh okay, they said you dm’d for a/s/l and i wanted to make sure you weren’t a pedo
[2:19:47] <helidzz> you can do this fight without healing items
[2:19:50] <jonathandemel> Did he take an attack boost during the cutscene attack?
[2:19:52] <%generalve> just lower the difficulty
[2:19:52] <austin9568> Get sneked
[2:19:53] <zepelinnn1> yes but its not that bad, the beggining was easy
[2:20:12] <IsacDee> @optimasmaximas He's the one who dm'd me that though
[2:20:12] <facuvillamil> it's better to counter with a fireball after he uses Kimimaru
[2:20:12] <Andrei11Droasca> Is just me or does hes combo do 3 times more life then Woolies does?
[2:20:15] <zenith0111> @woolieversus When you substitute chakra dash to put pressure on him
[2:20:20] <%lordsdb> chat canc he do combo into super?
[2:20:24] <kiharakun> like those 2 potions heal so little that the legend stun kunai would be worth more
[2:20:29] <Alzero83> Get Fauked
[2:20:33] <Arek_1> I just checked. Edo Itachi's tilt attack is the Crow Clone Jutsu again.
[2:20:34] <%VidulaSaix> Chat telling him to do things hes already doing LUL
[2:20:35] <+saltpiggu> man, the it sound effects sound so weak
[2:20:36] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[2:20:36] <Dragon_Batman> He has chakra dashed but sometimes he gets hit out of it
[2:20:37] <alephalpha> you can block rocks right?
[2:20:37] <rubbishbinge> Some characters can connect a super off a launcher
[2:20:38] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:20:38] <%VidulaSaix> You will
[2:20:39] <Solidnick18> yes
[2:20:41] <optimasmaximas> @isacdee you got a screen grab of that?
[2:20:42] <+Manderson1998> @rheviel yes but the first portion is easy and he can do the qtes
[2:20:43] <biomegabear> Its like fighting the priest in DMC4
[2:20:43] <monzy101> Yeah
[2:20:44] <rubbishbinge> Ye
[2:20:50] <+mattymcfilth> this is a tough ass fight dayum
[2:20:50] <%hitorio> Woolie VS Film Study
[2:20:50] <%VidulaSaix> Its not worth it
[2:20:51] <R3c0n31> you will fight again
[2:20:53] <%VidulaSaix> You got close
[2:20:56] <%VidulaSaix> Just keep at it
[2:20:57] <+NiSoKr> He's a boss with permanent awakening and a power boost item
[2:21:02] <jonathandemel> Keep at it
[2:21:02] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You have all you need to do it Woolie
[2:21:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[2:21:06] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus try to sub through the stone walls
[2:21:06] <%generalve> this fight is bullshit
[2:21:07] <Solidnick18> you did get close
[2:21:16] <optimasmaximas> @vidulasaix the internet is an unusual yet entertaining thing isnt it? LUL
[2:21:17] <%hitorio> I take it THIS is why that guy was telling Woolie to go to Cloud and eat food to make his life easier.
[2:21:19] <rubbishbinge> Aight
[2:21:19] <+kazekyou> this fight is terrible
[2:21:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is probably Woolie's Sword Saint Isshin.
[2:21:29] <rheviel> Dark souls it
[2:21:30] <kiharakun> welp, the sunken cost has set in
[2:21:35] <+Manderson1998> @WoolieVersus go to the bento shop in the cloud village. theres a fast travel girl in leaf village.
[2:21:39] <Doodle_Taco> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli This but unironically
[2:21:40] <Sokumotanaka> Chat why do the unchihas have stands?
[2:21:48] <Dragon_Batman> Cuz
[2:21:50] <%VidulaSaix> Whats really getting him is the unneccesary damage when he dashes back into the bones too early
[2:21:50] <Iggeh0> this is your punishment for being so nosy
[2:21:52] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You can can side step the last boulder
[2:21:57] <WanderingSwordsman> Shut up tho
[2:21:58] <RpgFoLife> I frames Woolz
[2:21:59] <RayCSmooth> don't forget to grab
[2:22:01] <jonathandemel> Eee
[2:22:02] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Try the tilt attack. Flick the right stick + O.
[2:22:03] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> woolieDATTEBAYO_BW
[2:22:11] <jonathandemel> Oh wow he got a full combo
[2:22:13] <%Lylliek> @Sokumotanaka The answer is always "Sharingan."
[2:22:14] <dundore77> you need mangekyo sharingan and have both eyes. its just uchiha eye hax bullshit
[2:22:15] <zayasu> HahaCat
[2:22:15] <optimasmaximas> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Is his chakra bar the stamina/posture bar? LUL
[2:22:16] <@Solidus_113> you can use shuriken while dodging too, you don't need to stop one to do the other
[2:22:21] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus try his tilt attack
[2:22:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yes
[2:22:22] <Arblaster_> I don't get why they feel the need to make all anime fighters 3d
[2:22:31] <tookool5678> use tilt attack.
[2:22:32] <optimasmaximas> DEMON WIND SHURIKEN
[2:22:35] <Arek_1> Err, left stick.
[2:22:37] <zenith0111> MORE CHAKRA DASHES
[2:22:37] <alephalpha> TRY TILT ATTACK MAYBE
[2:22:38] <monzy101> That MK3 difficulty
[2:22:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Watch Kabuto pull out a glock in the third phase
[2:22:46] <Dragon_Batman> Well you are dealing with a cpu, I wouldn't be surprised if input reading was constant
[2:22:48] <%VidulaSaix> @Arblaster_ Because they sell well
[2:22:49] <%s_xylocalsingles> s_xylocalsingles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! if Itachi were a bible character who would he be, also ive been following your content for almost 8 years since you joined Matt and Pat, im 24 in 2 weeks, thanks for raising me Father Woolie.
[2:22:50] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Try the tilt attack. Flick the left stick + O.
[2:23:03] <+NiSoKr> GET CONFUSED
[2:23:04] <+MrRabbles> that looks op
[2:23:05] <Andrei11Droasca> BEAT OR FEED @woolieversus
[2:23:08] <+ggbhtg> BIRD
[2:23:09] <rubbishbinge> Woa
[2:23:11] <dundore77> if its like the oolder ones itachi's tilts are great
[2:23:11] <%hitorio> @Arblaster_ speaking from my child perspective, it's because fans basically want to feel like they're playing the series, and 2D doesn't quite capture that feeling
[2:23:12] <zenith0111> YE YE YE YE YE
[2:23:12] <+ggbhtg> UP.
[2:23:13] <alephalpha> IT'S INVINCIBLE
[2:23:14] <%VidulaSaix> The bird are iframes I believe
[2:23:15] <rubbishbinge> d a m a g e
[2:23:15] <Dragon_Batman> No it's only toward
[2:23:16] <jonathandemel> Is it INVINCIBLE?
[2:23:17] <alephalpha> APPARENTLY
[2:23:19] <+BurkeBigsby> that damage was pretty decent on the birb.
[2:23:19] <Arek_1> Yeyeye.
[2:23:23] <alephalpha> someone said that earlier
[2:23:24] <Dragon_Batman> I think it actually is
[2:23:28] <OldManDeckardCain> remember when at the start of the stream they were complaining about easy mode LUL
[2:23:29] <zenith0111> USE THOSE I-FRAMES
[2:23:30] <%hitorio> @Arblaster_ take the Dragon Ball FighterZ vs Xenoverse arguments as an example
[2:23:32] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You might be fine since its fulky invincible
[2:23:32] <Jane_Lo> So, chat, is this standart difficulty? The base game is this bullshit?
[2:23:36] <monzy101> No way.
[2:23:37] <biomegabear> How do you beat this?
[2:23:40] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> fully*
[2:23:45] <optimasmaximas> @jane_lo Yes and yep
[2:23:47] <Doodle_Taco> Snek dik
[2:23:50] <jonathandemel> @biomegabear Don't suck and do combo
[2:23:50] <%VidulaSaix> This is standard
[2:23:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Isnt the base game more manageable?
[2:23:53] <kiharakun> nah, he is just underleveled for this so he is forced to play perfect
[2:23:54] <+NiSoKr> Beat this by not getting hit
[2:23:54] <Alzero83> i cant comment cause i never had this trouble in any storm games
[2:23:54] <%VidulaSaix> And this is the final final boss
[2:23:55] <rubbishbinge> Game isn't that hard, it's just not Woolie's kind of game
[2:23:57] <+ggbhtg> @jane_lo he's a post final boss boss
[2:23:59] <%VidulaSaix> DLC Boss
[2:24:03] <+kaiju7544> Way more fireball jutsu’s
[2:24:04] <Jane_Lo> @optimasmaximas oh jeez
[2:24:07] <biomegabear> @jonathandemel sounds good
[2:24:08] <ledwin94> This is standard but I remember this boss being the hardest
[2:24:13] <@Solidus_113> Kabuto is Fume Knight
[2:24:13] <zenith0111> calebRage_RD calebRage_RD calebRage_RD calebRage_RD calebRage_RD
[2:24:14] <Jane_Lo> Oh, I see now
[2:24:17] <+mattymcfilth> oh no hes getting worse
[2:24:17] <tookool5678> spam supers from a distance.
[2:24:18] <+thebabyseal3060> his dash gets priority cuz hes awakened
[2:24:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is him basically fighting Lingering Will
[2:24:24] <DaikiWithDaShot> do combo and get better at dashing to avoid stiff
[2:24:24] <zenith0111> Cum back calebGasm
[2:24:27] <%generalve> comeback Kappa
[2:24:34] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus the crows attack has i frames apparently
[2:24:36] <+kaiju7544> it sucks that Kabuto is stuck in awakened mode
[2:24:36] <jonathandemel> TILT
[2:24:37] <Alzero83> No, Be Aggressive
[2:24:42] <tookool5678> do not block.
[2:24:42] <+berserkscarlett> you really gotta lab this match up huh
[2:24:49] <rubbishbinge> Need to interrupt more
[2:24:51] <monzy101> blocking is super punished
[2:24:52] <dundore77> itachi's tilts are his best moves
[2:24:55] <+Manderson1998> @WoolieVersus go to the bento shop in the cloud village. theres a fast travel girl in leaf village.
[2:24:55] <Floridamangentlyweepsact3> tilt spam its actually invulnerable and leads to combo
[2:24:55] <blue6sub6remnant6> Oh no, we lost Minh.
[2:24:56] <%generalve> you should prob take a break
[2:24:56] <alephalpha> TILE SEEMS TO HAVE I-FRAMES
[2:25:03] <Andrei11Droasca> Thats 5 life bars of that shit ,by the way
[2:25:03] <+BurkeBigsby> These games are designed for children to mash. Using logic and reason seems to backfire. atpWind
[2:25:04] <AMstone776> be, be agressive
[2:25:05] <zenith0111> @berserkscarlett DLC Character doodCrazy_RD
[2:25:07] <%VidulaSaix> Blocking works but blocking the multi hit moves gets you stunned
[2:25:10] <biomegabear> Does woolie have I-frames where doing his ulitmite?
[2:25:11] <%VidulaSaix> If aggression works better, go for it
[2:25:16] <DaikiWithDaShot> @vidulasaix yeah
[2:25:17] <rubbishbinge> His guard break values seem inflated
[2:25:23] <%hitorio> Holy shit; al lthose are life bars; I hadn't even noticed
[2:25:23] <Alzero83> Use Special in the moment hes in a frame of weakness during a dodge
[2:25:31] <@Solidus_113> no different from a chakra dash
[2:25:32] <rubbishbinge> I frames confirmed
[2:25:37] <RayCSmooth> Attack Attack Attack
[2:25:39] <+Bluydee> chakra backdashes are also good
[2:25:41] <rubbishbinge> That's good tho
[2:25:47] <%VidulaSaix> Terra Shield is literally Kabuto doing a Table FLip LUL
[2:25:55] <@Solidus_113> it's flick stick and then tap attack
[2:25:58] <+kaiju7544> Aggressive with substitutions, when substitutions are low, back off and keep one in the pocket. Fireball Hutus and move until substitutions come back, switch back to offense.
[2:25:59] <Andrei11Droasca> He should at least try to spam supers
[2:26:01] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @zenith0111
[2:26:04] <rubbishbinge> Flick and tap
[2:26:06] <Alzero83> That Line in the Bar is the Ultimate Requirement
[2:26:07] <%VidulaSaix> Flick n tap
[2:26:07] <biomegabear> happy birthday
[2:26:08] <Floridamangentlyweepsact3> the tilt is free
[2:26:11] <TheWashoutXY> KABUTO IS FED
[2:26:12] <alephalpha> FLICK AND TAP
[2:26:22] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> no its flick then tap
[2:26:24] <rubbishbinge> Opposite
[2:26:25] <%generalve> I think at this point just watch a YouTube video cause this fight is bullshit
[2:26:26] <Floridamangentlyweepsact3> Flick then tap
[2:26:27] <Morning_Asakura> no
[2:26:28] <%VidulaSaix> Opposite
[2:26:31] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus direction motion, neutral motion, attack
[2:26:34] <jonathandemel> Can you repeat that?
[2:26:35] <Morning_Asakura> flick, tap
[2:26:35] <beno113> woolieVERGIN
[2:26:35] <Alzero83> Answer is No, Shut up
[2:26:35] <kiharakun> its seeming like he needs to mental reset
[2:26:36] <MyNameIsRasus> 3
[2:26:37] <zayasu> LUL
[2:26:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:26:38] <monzy101> I know assist is strong, but the issue is that his hitboxes are RIDICULOUS!
[2:26:38] <Drakenstorm13> @WoolieVersus i think youcan switch to sasuke by hiting L1 and R1 together
[2:26:41] <Morning_Asakura> who said that
[2:26:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie stop feeding!
[2:26:45] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[2:26:52] <DaBigVitus> what up Pukie VS
[2:26:54] <tookool5678> use your supers from a distance.
[2:26:55] <%JohnAtDawn> what
[2:26:55] <jonathandemel> LMAO
[2:26:56] <+Bluydee> @Drakenstorm13 not this game
[2:26:56] <blue6sub6remnant6> woolieREMEMBERS I believe in you unironically Woolie! woolieREMEMBERS
[2:27:01] <Alzero83> Cant believe Pat sank so low as to get into League
[2:27:01] <Andrei11Droasca> SNEK IS FEED
[2:27:02] <jonathandemel> OMG
[2:27:03] <Doodle_Taco> Izanami or feef
[2:27:05] <Jetsfantasy> gg, cassio fed
[2:27:05] <zenith0111> @woolieversus After you substitute they purposely put you just outside of attack range. So you need to chakra dash or move forward to punish properly
[2:27:06] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Forward, n, Attack
[2:27:09] <fist_wizard_jay> wait did we go to NUNS 4?
[2:27:10] <$trueherobappo> Itachi or feed, kabutonis fed
[2:27:11] <zayasu> woolie feeding again ResidentSleeper
[2:27:18] <biomegabear> Remember when woolie said "This was a lossing battle for Kabuto"
[2:27:22] <AMstone776> again this is not in NUNS4
[2:27:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Can we ban Woolie for feeding?
[2:27:24] <%hitorio> Gotta love those characters whose moves pull from the environment. Baiken pulling tatami mats off of the desert floor. Hisui pulling houseplants out of her ass
[2:27:29] <AMstone776> this is NUNS3
[2:27:30] <jonathandemel> Oof, stil, the first bar
[2:27:37] <alephalpha> man hisui is rad
[2:27:45] <Floridamangentlyweepsact3> u could just watch the ending of this fight on youtube you are just about done lol
[2:27:45] <+thatfig> is the fight getting harder
[2:27:45] <DaikiWithDaShot> @zenith0111 or punish using your jutsu right?
[2:27:53] <zenith0111> @daikiwithdashot Ye
[2:27:55] <LeBlanc233> Kabuto Min maxed hardcore it seems
[2:27:59] <beno113> Bento time?
[2:28:00] <+leerocku> Why is he not doing the Sasuke combo extender after fireball
[2:28:03] <$trueherobappo> @woolieversus Just have him waste his subs and then just combo his booty hole
[2:28:04] <aracon_> oh dear
[2:28:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:28:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HE MUST WIN
[2:28:12] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> never stop staying out
[2:28:12] <contrope> Does this part has block+square parry that stuns enemy for free super?
[2:28:15] <kiharakun> go back, restock and mental reset
[2:28:15] <%jinking79> it just like the show
[2:28:21] <optimasmaximas> @woolieversus ANKO OR FEED 😡
[2:28:22] <%VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus If you sub out of a combo as your subs are regenerating, best just take the combo if it's already deep into it cause that stops the regen of your subs
[2:28:24] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Flick stick, back to neutral, then Attack to tilt attack
[2:28:25] <Alzero83> Fighting Game mechanics dont work here
[2:28:27] <+CoronetChris> You might need a break, the more you bash your head the worse it gets.
[2:28:29] <Dragon_Batman> Is it same time?
[2:28:35] <+Manderson1998> @WoolieVersus go to the bento shop in the cloud village. theres a fast travel girl in leaf village.
[2:28:37] <biomegabear> grab more?
[2:28:42] <%jake_protagonist> That punish with ultimate strat seemed good
[2:28:47] <Dragon_Batman> grab range is pretty ass tho
[2:28:48] <zenith0111> WOOLIES FEEDING
[2:28:49] <sangi53> woolie I believe you can do it
[2:28:53] <AMstone776> Why you pressin buttons? Press buttons fool
[2:28:57] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Itachi's grab is bad. Its only good against people
[2:28:58] <betrayed_llama> F to your life bar LUL
[2:29:00] <%hitorio> Imagine Anko actually having a crowning moment of awesome by fighting Kabuto here.
[2:29:04] <jonathandemel> Take a break
[2:29:06] <+deidriel> spam your ultimates
[2:29:06] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Flick stick, let it go to neutral, then Attack to tilt attack
[2:29:07] <%VidulaSaix> The items wont matter because his Hro level is too low
[2:29:07] <biomegabear> @Damashi_The_Kaotic ok
[2:29:11] <alephalpha> it should have been anko's fight
[2:29:11] <%VidulaSaix> Best he can do is eat Bento
[2:29:16] <rheviel> so you can block the stone walls and substitute them. blocking them will get you stunned if you block two.
[2:29:20] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus I remembered some hidden tech. At a certain point during your O strings that have enough hitstun or launcher, you can cancel with Ninja Move (NMC, direction + hold X) and cancel into Ultimate Jutsu.
[2:29:24] <kiharakun> the bento buff is actually pretty massive
[2:29:24] <Alzero83> Your Blocking WAY too much
[2:29:24] <fist_wizard_jay> Sorry, had to drop out of stream earlier so thanks for answering guys. Cant wait to see Woolie in NUNS 4
[2:29:25] <zenith0111> Who's Anko? I forget
[2:29:25] <Andrei11Droasca> So i used to think this was one of the better fights in Naruto, this is changing my opinion really fast LUL
[2:29:30] <Alzero83> Get in there
[2:29:36] <Dragon_Batman> That and maybe eat a defense or attack bento, if it stacks maybe both
[2:29:37] <+freezydude> you have to hit them woolie.
[2:29:39] <zenith0111> Was Anko that fat dude from the sand village?
[2:29:41] <Floridamangentlyweepsact3> was there a fight before this with sasuke?
[2:29:43] <+thatfig> why not just spam level 3
[2:29:46] <joylent_blue> zenith0111 fishnet boob lady
[2:29:49] <%hitorio> I read the manga of this fight, and I found it extra drab. CyberConnect is making it look good
[2:29:51] <jonathandemel> @zenith0111 Hot lady from Part 1, Orochimaru's old apprentice when he was loyal
[2:29:57] <fist_wizard_jay> Isnt Anko that fat lady from Boruto
[2:29:58] <dundore77> Anko is the girl who wears the fishnet and is the procter for the 2nd chuunin exam stage
[2:29:59] <tookool5678> He needs Hero Points for better healing.
[2:30:05] <aracon_> holy shit
[2:30:06] <Alzero83> Your Zooming in and blocking intstantly, Just attack
[2:30:08] <deadshot27> I'm guessing spamming ultimates isn't effective in this fight?
[2:30:12] <zenith0111> @joylent_blue Oh you mean backround character 4 gotcha
[2:30:18] <+Manderson1998> @WoolieVersus he needs to get the mega bento from the cloud village. it boosts both attack and defense. wont win it for him but itll give him more room
[2:30:19] <dundore77> and yes Anko gets super fat in boruto
[2:30:19] <rubbishbinge> Take a pee break
[2:30:26] <tookool5678> spam super works.
[2:30:46] <zenith0111> I legit forgot who Anko was LUL
[2:30:50] <+thebabyseal3060> itachis ult is really tough to land
[2:30:51] <optimasmaximas> @fist_wizard_jay shh, they liked her and woolie and reggie dont know what happened to her yet
[2:30:52] <%hitorio> Remember when Orochimaru basically told Anko she was the LowTierGod of Orochimaru's apprentices and that Sasuke actually had talent
[2:30:56] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Here's some hidden tech. At a certain point during your O strings that have enough hitstun or launcher, you can cancel with Ninja Move (NMC, direction + hold X) and cancel into Ultimate Jutsu.
[2:31:01] <jonathandemel> Pff
[2:31:02] <Dragon_Batman> I like to think Kishimoto did as well
[2:31:02] <+Risingxiv> What does that yellow and red meter next to the character portrait mean?
[2:31:03] <Andrei11Droasca> @zenith0111 dont worrie ,Kishimoto also forgot
[2:31:03] <+ggbhtg> how does spamming super work if he can block or substitute it?
[2:31:04] <Alzero83> Do that Again!
[2:31:09] <Alzero83> Double Triable
[2:31:09] <%VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Someone in chat suggested this earlier so idk if its true, but can you press R1/L1 same time to switch to Sasuke?
[2:31:11] <+freezydude> i would just keep the support drive
[2:31:21] <+Bluydee> @VidulaSaix not this game
[2:31:22] <rubbishbinge> No tagging in this game
[2:31:23] <+ggbhtg> You CAN'T tag until Storm 4
[2:31:24] <joylent_blue> zenith0111 real answer, she's the person who gave the Forest of Death chunin exam
[2:31:27] <%VidulaSaix> Ah okay
[2:31:33] <zenith0111> @andrei11droasca Wasn't she like one of like 50 other "apprentices?"
[2:31:34] <%hitorio> @Andrei11Droasca Nah; in the manga, Anko's literally in this scene the entire time just knocked the fuck out on the ground... and she never had dialogue again in the series
[2:31:35] <+ggbhtg> get that outta here
[2:31:41] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio LMAO, straight told her she wasnt shit LUL
[2:31:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE IS IN FULL FOCUS MODE
[2:31:56] <+omenzazu> I dont remember this fight giving me much trouble lol
[2:31:56] <zenith0111> @joylent_blue Sickly Man? PogChamp
[2:31:57] <+Nickmobox> Game is super hype tbf
[2:31:59] <Solidnick18> do it good
[2:32:11] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus if you quit out to refill on gear, make sure to eat a Defense Bento as well. They're on the gear menu before fights
[2:32:11] <Arek_1> @VidulaSaix You can't switch characters. You can only call assists.
[2:32:13] <biomegabear> kabuto's earth jutsu is so goofy, the rock comes out of the ground then falls on you
[2:32:13] <+omenzazu> then again I've been on this series for fucking forever lol
[2:32:16] <+freezydude> can you block the rocks?
[2:32:19] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Here's some hidden tech. At a certain point during your O strings that have enough hitstun or launcher, you can cancel with Ninja Move (NMC, direction + hold X) and cancel into Ultimate Jutsu.
[2:32:20] <jonathandemel> It is honestly hype, just a bit pattern learning heavy in some parts
[2:32:21] <Morning_Asakura> get bentos
[2:32:22] <MyNameIsRasus> CLOUD BENTO TIME
[2:32:22] <alephalpha> someone said you can block the rocks earlier
[2:32:28] <DaikiWithDaShot> @freezydude bad idea
[2:32:29] <+CoronetChris> Take a break.
[2:32:35] <%hitorio> The manga showed Kabuto dashing toward Anko for one panel, then we later see that she got bodied offscreen, and that was the last time we see Anko conscious until the series ends
[2:32:36] <@Solidus_113> defense bento
[2:32:40] <alephalpha> taking a break also sound slike a good idea
[2:32:41] <biomegabear> defence
[2:32:42] <rubbishbinge> More D
[2:32:42] <Alzero83> I think your Blocking too much, Woolie
[2:32:42] <+freezydude> @DaikiWithDaShot it's better than just eating the hit
[2:32:46] <NinjaGentleman> L2
[2:32:46] <Andrei11Droasca> F
[2:32:48] <%VidulaSaix> Bento is the only thing that will matter I think. Healing items wont help cause you Hero level is too low to equip
[2:32:49] <Dragon_Batman> You eat those before fighting in item
[2:32:52] <rubbishbinge> Pre battle bonus
[2:32:54] <Alzero83> Your blocking and not striking when the time is right
[2:32:55] <lonlono> village hidden in the bento
[2:32:58] <kiharakun> the bento is the full heal buff items
[2:32:59] <beno113> Those are bad
[2:33:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> bentos will beat Kabuto
[2:33:03] <Lionkevinson> Boxed lunches
[2:33:04] <%VidulaSaix> Defense mainly
[2:33:05] <helidzz> those suck
[2:33:05] <zenith0111> Village hidden in the ramen
[2:33:06] <%TheDyingPride> Grab the good bento, those are of the weak variety
[2:33:07] <Morning_Asakura> read
[2:33:09] <kiharakun> the cloud village has a max attack max defense bento
[2:33:10] <Morning_Asakura> read it
[2:33:13] <bethore> @WoolieVersus The bentos at cloud give max buff to atk and def
[2:33:15] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Here's some hidden tech. At a certain point during your O strings that have enough hitstun or launcher, you can cancel with Ninja Move (NMC, direction + hold X) and cancel into Ultimate Jutsu.
[2:33:18] <+NiSoKr> They are pre fight buffs
[2:33:22] <zenith0111> BUY A COUPON
[2:33:24] <+Bluydee> the good ones are in Cloud
[2:33:24] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus you can buff up befote the fight even starts
[2:33:25] <$trueherobappo> bentos last the entire fight tho..
[2:33:26] <biomegabear> How does woolie buy better?
[2:33:27] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[2:33:37] <%VidulaSaix> Think of it like eating in Monster Hunter
[2:33:38] <helidzz> pre fight
[2:33:40] <jonathandemel> PRE
[2:33:40] <%VidulaSaix> Thats Bentos
[2:33:43] <Morning_Asakura> pre
[2:33:45] <JohnAtDawn> Just back out and do a hero thing real wuick to get the better heal
[2:33:45] <%hitorio> This is the power of a housewife. Bento boxes literally make the difference between defeating a Perfect Snake God or not.
[2:33:52] <alephalpha> prefight last for the entire fight apparentlty
[2:33:52] <@Solidus_113> The bentos are pre fight and last the whole time
[2:34:06] <Dragon_Batman> Do they also last to Itachi?
[2:34:08] <%hitorio> Blowjob and a sandwich = every stat buffed to max stack
[2:34:16] <Andrei11Droasca> We could just watch the fight in the anime and be done with this shit you know ! @woolieversus
[2:34:18] <rubbishbinge> Can you put the same items in different slots?
[2:34:20] <@Solidus_113> but it's minimum buff
[2:34:22] <Dragon_Batman> Like if you switch character will it persist
[2:34:22] <@Solidus_113> it's weak
[2:34:23] <helidzz> but it's minimum
[2:34:27] <Morning_Asakura> MINIMUM
[2:34:28] <helidzz> its the worst ones
[2:34:29] <alephalpha> those are weak
[2:34:29] <joylent_blue> make sure you get the Felyne Moxie buff :)
[2:34:31] <Arek_1> Will they last for Itachi?
[2:34:43] <+Manderson1998> yes they will
[2:34:43] <$trueherobappo> yes
[2:34:49] <AMstone776> Yes and the Cloud Village is the best one and they will last the entire time.
[2:35:04] <%hitorio> Why are we controlling this obscure blonde orange guy now?
[2:35:04] <powerprotoman> consider leveling your hero level so you can use good healing items in battle
[2:35:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:35:09] <Dragon_Batman> Aah than those would do good
[2:35:10] <+Manderson1998> youre in the right area
[2:35:16] <alephalpha> how long would it take to level hero
[2:35:20] <+ggbhtg> you're trying to get higher tier pre buffs I suppose
[2:35:26] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio which only furthers that Hinata best girl: best boobs AND best wife; cant be a god on an empty stomach LUL
[2:35:28] <Dragon_Batman> You could also re do hero fights to get the better in fight heals
[2:35:29] <%VidulaSaix> Bee LUL
[2:35:31] <joylent_blue> yeah i thought Itachi was the main character of Naruto
[2:35:34] <%JohnAtDawn> YO BEE
[2:35:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Holy shit the view combined with the cell shading made me think this was borderlands for like two seconds and naruto running toward the screen made me think he was a bandit to shoot
[2:35:39] <Solidnick18> bee chilling
[2:35:45] <+Manderson1998> it wouldnt take too long if they replay the missions hero side
[2:35:46] <jonathandemel> TUTORIAL
[2:35:49] <%VidulaSaix> You want MAX

[2:36:40] <zenith0111> BUY MORE FOR FUTURE BATTLES
[2:36:48] <%VidulaSaix> There is no future battles

[2:36:50] <+freezydude> what future battles are there
[2:36:52] <+freezydude> lol
[2:36:53] <rubbishbinge> P2W
[2:36:53] <jonathandemel> What are games where money matters?
[2:36:56] <Morning_Asakura> there are no more
[2:36:57] <helidzz> theres no future battles
[2:37:13] <@Solidus_113> someone's breathing into their mic
[2:37:21] <+omenzazu> Minh the Spend all buy all vs the Cheapskate reggie
[2:37:23] <bethore> @WoolieVersus Healing items are back in Hidden Leaf, but you need blueprints to buy them
[2:37:38] <goose_attack_almanac> Mabui the babe
[2:37:39] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Here's some hidden tech. At a certain point during your O strings that have enough hitstun or launcher, you can cancel with Ninja Move (NMC, direction + hold X) and cancel into Ultimate Jutsu.
[2:37:40] <+Bluydee> raikage confused
[2:37:45] <%VidulaSaix> I honestly dont think you'll need them if you cant find them
[2:37:48] <%VidulaSaix> Bento should be enough
[2:37:48] <DaikiWithDaShot> @goose_attack_almanac you right you right
[2:37:50] <optimasmaximas> Minh tell us more about drifting during this intermission Kappa
[2:37:55] <Andrei11Droasca> Just by that shit like it was the bullion of Nigeria
[2:38:02] <jonathandemel> Samui is hot
[2:38:04] <%VidulaSaix> She's probably in Raikages office
[2:38:05] <%hitorio> Samui is literally never modeled in this game.
[2:38:06] <Dragon_Batman> She might be some where here

[2:46:26] <Dragon_Batman> Get the other ones and equip em all

[2:46:58] <Hentailovr> Did people explain to Woolie that Itachi and Sasuke couldn't kill Kabuto cuz Edo Tensei has to be voluntarely dispelled? Cuz that is knda important to why Kabuto is so confident
[2:46:58] <biomegabear> fuck
[2:46:59] <bethore> @WoolieVersus Buy level 2 healing too, and equip multiple healing items
[2:47:00] <rheviel> can you bring two heals?
[2:47:04] <kiharakun> check if there are lower level substitution logs
[2:47:04] <Andrei11Droasca> Cant he only use like 3 or something LUL

[2:47:21] <+Bluydee> buy the level 2 and 1 healing pots
[2:47:21] <zenith0111> @woolieversus Money buys more characters for versus mode but I don't think you'll play it versus LUL
[2:47:22] <RpgFoLife> or am I wrong?
[2:47:22] <DaikiWithDaShot> @hitorio Remember Tenten getting that fan that can use all the chakra types
[2:47:25] <@Solidus_113> switch out the little chakra one for kunai rain
[2:47:25] <%hitorio> @Hentailovr I don't recall this being mentioned
[2:47:26] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @alephalpha
[2:47:27] <Arek_1> @Hentailovr Nah, that was glossed over.
[2:47:30] <+Manderson1998> buy some of the other level ones
[2:47:34] <rubbishbinge> Get more HP
[2:47:40] <Hentailovr> Then somebody please epplain to woolie. important stuff
[2:47:43] <%jake_protagonist> You can equip the small potions and buy potions at the same time
[2:47:49] <Dragon_Batman> Get lvl 3 heal and 2 heal
[2:47:51] <%VidulaSaix> Buy the smaller HP items

[2:47:59] <+Manderson1998> get lvl 2 and 3s
[2:48:00] <Raldavar> We all know the Madden bloodline is cursed to always confuse numbers on top of left and right. Whoever let Woolie navigate menus is a spy working for the enemy villages
[2:48:09] <rubbishbinge> Use different levels
[2:48:11] <Dragon_Batman> Substitute regen might not be a bad idea
[2:48:25] <zenith0111> Substitute Regen is for scrubs
[2:48:28] <Hentailovr> And yes I new woolie gonna struggle with this boss fight. It kinda has no chill
[2:48:29] <DaikiWithDaShot> SUBSTITUTION REGEN how did we forget
[2:48:31] <bethore> Buy level 2 healing
[2:48:31] <%hitorio> @DaikiWithDaShot Yeah. I don't recall what happened after she got the fan, though.
[2:48:32] <%VidulaSaix> So buy level 1 and 2 Woolie
[2:48:32] <Dragon_Batman> You have level 2 and 3
[2:48:33] <+JacknZack27> Maybe replace the lv 1 chakra with a level 2 heal?
[2:48:34] <+NiSoKr> You can equip 1 2 and 3
[2:48:36] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus see if you can buy substitute regen items
[2:48:39] <Andrei11Droasca> Im so glad they got rid of this shit in NUNS 4
[2:48:39] <jonathandemel> So use 1 and 2 Woolie
[2:48:40] <Morning_Asakura> so BUY THEM
[2:48:41] <NiktenKing> 1 and 2
[2:48:42] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Btw, Edo Tensei has to be voluntarily released. They can't kill Kabuto.
[2:48:45] <Dragon_Batman> Your only missing 4
[2:48:49] <rubbishbinge> you can buy 1 and 2
[2:48:57] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> Mihn doesn't know team colours, Woolie doesn't know right from left, Pat can't even smell puke... What's Reggie got?
[2:48:58] <Graxe_> More deeps or more heals
[2:49:08] <%VidulaSaix> Right so buy all 3
[2:49:08] <+JacknZack27> Can you buy more lv 1 and 2 healing
[2:49:12] <Graxe_> If things die faster, theoretically, you don't need the healing
[2:49:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:49:12] <%jake_protagonist> Buy level 2 and 1s then
[2:49:13] <BlackermanZX> Everything in legend is "fuck those scrub hero items"
[2:49:14] <%VidulaSaix> Yep
[2:49:15] <%hitorio> From a game design standpoint, that jutsu's disgustingly broken. What if someone just summons the Edo Tensei, the commits suicide?
[2:49:15] <zenith0111> Having installs is a bad idea? LUL
[2:49:20] <alephalpha> one sub stitution refill
[2:49:22] <kiharakun> the lightning kunai is dead ass broken as fuck, lets you land jutsu for free because it stuns
[2:49:25] <%VidulaSaix> I'd say Attack be your 4th
[2:49:29] <%VidulaSaix> Cause you'll have enough healing
[2:49:30] <sparkysponja> tacos
[2:49:31] <Hentailovr> @hitorio permanent zombies nobody can control
[2:49:34] <Arek_1> @mrfreezepunsbestpuns Foot fetish. LUL
[2:49:34] <@Solidus_113> yeah but it's not that worth it
[2:49:37] <$trueherobappo> no
[2:49:39] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus I saw an item called Mind's Eye that restores substitute fatter
[2:49:40] <rubbishbinge> Get subs?
[2:49:40] <Morning_Asakura> not worth it
[2:49:40] <%hitorio> @Hentailovr :|
[2:49:44] <Hentailovr> @hitorio there is a reason it's a super forbidden
[2:49:55] <Dragon_Batman> I think level 2 and 3 are the only ones worth it
[2:49:57] <@Solidus_113> The pills don't last long enough to waste a slot on
[2:50:02] <%VidulaSaix> Yep thats fine
[2:50:04] <jonathandemel> TANK
[2:50:07] <jonathandemel> BIG CHONKER
[2:50:10] <Morning_Asakura> don't waste the slot
[2:50:13] <Andrei11Droasca> Just fill Itachi with drugs LUL
[2:50:16] <%VidulaSaix> Now go run a train on Kabuto cause you're gonna wreck him now LUL
[2:50:18] <%lordsdb> Honestly the heals you have aren't that great, and this fight requires you to be offensive so might as well use the Legend items and go full Damage and get any buff you can @WoolieVersus
[2:50:19] <NiktenKing> Tank that snekboi
[2:50:26] <Morning_Asakura> well let's see how this goes
[2:50:26] <Iggeh0> and he was giving Choji shit about pills
[2:50:28] <+NiSoKr> Isn't there an item that instantlly refills substitutions?
[2:50:30] <bethore> NOOO... forget this mission
[2:50:32] <Doodle_Taco> We were the real Choji all along
[2:50:34] <helidzz> nevermind what chat said @WoolieVersus
[2:50:34] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus soldius says the pills arent worth it
[2:50:43] <%VidulaSaix> Thsi isnt worth it
[2:50:46] <@Solidus_113> it's fine
[2:50:51] <%hitorio> The fact that it's possible at all is honestly really broken combat design on Kishi's part. That's the kind of thing that makes for awkward writing when you have to make your characters act through the path of least resistance. evo19Think
[2:51:02] <DaikiWithDaShot> I substitution regen a hero item or legend item?
[2:51:03] <Andrei11Droasca> Woolie no SabaPing
[2:51:05] <Hentailovr> BTW @WoolieVersus About Kurama and being a shithead for killing Naruto parents. He was kinda killing his enslavers who were trying to re-enslave him. REally wanted to point that out. Of all problems with naruto forgiving everyone, fighting to escape slavery is not a moral wrong imo
[2:51:06] <%Exiliator> is that his moms comb?
[2:51:10] <Dragon_Batman> The only other thing you can do is do old fights to bump hero level to get to 4
[2:51:15] <kiharakun> its fine, the bento + items will be more than enough
[2:51:18] <%jazzcrasher> Eat a bento and we can start this.
[2:51:20] <%VidulaSaix> Chat no one cares about the sidequests
[2:51:22] <+jpipeman> So having only recently shown up, am I understanding it correctly that Woolie is grinding items because he can't beat the boss?
[2:51:23] <aracon_> chat relaaax
[2:51:32] <+MrRabbles> chat you are responding to the past
[2:51:32] <%hitorio> @jpipeman pretty much
[2:51:34] <+Manderson1998> you can replay old missions to bump up your hero mission
[2:51:34] <@Solidus_113> good thing you can start the mission from anywhere
[2:51:35] <zenith0111> KILL THIS GAME ALREADY
[2:51:37] <rubbishbinge> @jpipeman ye
[2:51:39] <biomegabear> Is this a the victory round?
[2:51:39] <+ggbhtg> BUT THE LADY thoooo LUL
[2:51:40] <muniea3> chat PANIC
[2:51:40] <Iggeh0> I refuse to chill
[2:51:41] <jonathandemel> LMAO
[2:51:47] <Morning_Asakura> NO THE LADY

[2:51:52] <+ggbhtg> DEVOUR HOUR yall
[2:51:53] <shockmaster3> Where's plague when you need him
[2:51:57] <bethore> You need to eat it as Sasuke
[2:51:59] <OldManDeckardCain> ONE NOT CHILL GUY
[2:52:04] <Hentailovr> @Malikwest11 they put it into a separate mode
[2:52:04] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Here's some hidden tech. At a certain point during your O strings that have enough hitstun or launcher, you can cancel with Ninja Move (NMC, direction + hold X) and cancel into Ultimate Jutsu.
[2:52:15] <%VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:52:16] <alephalpha> wait don't you need to eat it a sitachis or something
[2:52:16] <+MrRabbles> why does naruto eating power up itachi LUL
[2:52:17] <DaikiWithDaShot> @hentailovr They wouldn't be trying to enslave him if he stopped raging out. He wasn't even being controlled at that point, could've just left
[2:52:19] <aracon_> wait are you gonna start the fight from sasuke?
[2:52:19] <NinjaGentleman> BUT VIDEO GAMES
[2:52:20] <BlackermanZX> so whens Nuns4
[2:52:23] <+Nobara> @WoolieVersus needs to ignore chat they're a bunch of nerds anyway.
[2:52:33] <%hitorio> @MrRabbles Yeah; they should be talking about present topics like wondering when Woolie's going to do an LP of Ninja Storm 3
[2:52:34] <@Solidus_113> you'll get a bunch if you don't suck

[2:52:45] <%VidulaSaix> Just have eyes and youre fine
[2:52:47] <Hentailovr> @DaikiWithDaShot yes they would. Biju are naruto world's nukes. If they didn't recapture Kurama, other vilalges would pick them off like vultures. Kurama was getting recaptured no matter what
[2:52:48] <%VidulaSaix> LUL

[2:54:22] <@Solidus_113> all that damage woolieGASM
[2:54:22] <Hentailovr> Just to repeat since woolielikely didn't see. They glossed it over, but @WoolieVersus ITachi and Sasuke CANNOT kill Kabuto, cuz Reanimation has to be volunaterly released. If they just kill them, zombies are there forever. That's why he is so extra confident
[2:54:27] <%VidulaSaix> Damage LUL
[2:54:31] <kiharakun> god damn that is a shit load more damage
[2:54:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> Sasuke plays Mordekaiser
[2:54:33] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE
[2:54:33] <rubbishbinge> So much attack boost
[2:54:35] <Dragon_Batman> That is way more damage
[2:54:38] <DaikiWithDaShot> @hentailovr That's the point, he's getting captured because he's a nuke. The nature of the beasts is to be dangerous weapons, I don't think them being "enslaved" is a problem considering that they'd kill everyone anyway. I don't think he has moral correctness there
[2:54:39] <Solidnick18> that's fat damage
[2:54:42] <Doodle_Taco> Sasuke is H U G E
[2:54:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Sasuke mains Teemo

[2:55:15] <DaikiWithDaShot> Trying to escape slavery when your a villain doesn't mean you have the moral high ground lol
[2:55:16] <Hentailovr> @DaikiWithDaShot if that was the case, Naruto befriending them and learning their names wouldn't matter. I

[2:55:47] <Hentailovr> man, Storm 4 improved facial expressions SOOO MUCH, can't wait
[2:55:48] <%Exiliator> Could this be turned turned into some kind of bible reference?
[2:55:48] <%VidulaSaix> Yeha you have to do this for the stars
[2:55:56] <Hentailovr> these expressions are already pretty CC2 cash money
[2:55:59] <%hitorio> I'll have him scroll through terabytes of Naruto fanfiction

[2:56:04] <Graxe_> Oh no, the cave tentacles
[2:56:04] <Hentailovr> but generation jump was something else
[2:56:11] <aracon_> uh oh
[2:56:17] <Crashfan01> cavetecles
[2:56:18] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> oh fuck, is Woolie's prophecy coming true and will literally no-one be dead except for Kabuto, everyone who died up till now being revived and the reviver dying.

[2:57:34] <zenith0111> @hitorio LUL
[2:57:34] <Sokumotanaka> that's a lame name
[2:57:35] <rubbishbinge> His glasses are plot tho
[2:57:37] <Dragon_Batman> They're probably just the ones that people get for show
[2:57:37] <Saito_Sakaki> The QTE scenes in these games are always good looking.
[2:57:39] <biomegabear> its a flash bang
[2:57:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> White Extremist Attack?!
[2:57:40] <DaikiWithDaShot> @hentailovr Him befriending every demon is kinda inconsistent. The show is a little dumb lol
[2:57:40] <jonathandemel> @Solidus_113 They're from his mom, read his backstory lol
[2:57:41] <Crashfan01> white extremist attack
[2:57:42] <%TheDyingPride> Flashbang no Jutsu!
[2:57:43] <+MrRabbles> if he didn't have the glasses how would you know its kabuto
[2:57:47] <+trippersigs22> european extreme attack
[2:57:54] <Shishi1205> solidus remember the glasses were backstory
[2:57:58] <@Solidus_113> I don't
[2:57:58] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah
[2:58:00] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah
[2:58:03] <%JohnAtDawn> No
[2:58:04] <jonathandemel> What nio
[2:58:05] <%VidulaSaix> He caught wind of Itachi
[2:58:05] <+GreenCMD> yep
[2:58:06] <helidzz> nope
[2:58:06] <jonathandemel> NO
[2:58:06] <rubbishbinge> Oh god I forgot his backstory is that he is the glasses
[2:58:06] <DaikiWithDaShot> Let's start it up again
[2:58:07] <+GreenCMD> no
[2:58:11] <+GreenCMD> god damn it mihn
[2:58:16] <jonathandemel> Sasuke was surprised
[2:58:17] <Dragon_Batman> Nah Itachi just passed by and Sasuke was like what the fuck you dead
[2:58:18] <%JohnAtDawn> Sasuke ran into Itachi by chance.
[2:58:18] <helidzz> he found itachi by luck and decided to follow him
[2:58:21] <%Exiliator> Woolie yes, Minh No
[2:58:22] <Morning_Asakura> chat...
[2:58:25] <%hitorio> Kabuto is the glasses, and the person we know as Kabuto is actually the mech evo19MindBlown
[2:58:27] <alephalpha> why the umbilical cord snake though
[2:58:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Sasuke was on his way to destroy the leaf
[2:58:29] <Ianrazz> Black Hunting, White Extreme Attack... I think Kishimoto is trying to tell us something
[2:58:30] <%senoue> Requiem
[2:58:35] <Sokumotanaka> HE IE COMES
[2:58:35] <Afrobrawler> chance meeting
[2:58:37] <Hentailovr> I actually don't remember how well Storm 3 covers Kabuto backstory. I actually like dit in the manga. It was sad and itmakes compelte sense that he turned into this sociopath
[2:58:43] <Sokumotanaka> Oh reall?
[2:58:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Wait are you guys telling me Shinpachi is Kabuto?
[2:58:45] <%VidulaSaix> Storm 3 doesnt do his story
[2:58:45] <+texflexrex> i don't think sasuke even knew itachi was alive
[2:58:52] <%VidulaSaix> Just this fight
[2:58:52] <+texflexrex> er reanimated
[2:58:52] <%TheDyingPride> moist
[2:58:53] <%Chichen> why tho
[2:58:54] <Graxe_> Could Gold Experience Requiem beat out Izanami?
[2:58:56] <wendigo172> Kabuto’s backstory is great imo.
[2:58:59] <@Solidus_113> still have the buff
[2:59:00] <aracon_> heeere we go
[2:59:01] <DaikiWithDaShot> @hentailovr This game doesn't cover much at all
[2:59:03] <+MrRabbles> Itachi kept the buff nice
[2:59:04] <+Grayhammatter> what... why?
[2:59:08] <TwinBat> great but fucked up
[2:59:10] <Hentailovr> Fuck, somebody tell woolie to do homework after this then
[2:59:14] <muniea3> seamless
[2:59:14] <Andrei11Droasca> Just keep the sword Itachi ! SwiftRage
[2:59:15] <jonathandemel> THE DAMAGE
[2:59:18] <%VidulaSaix> Pimp slap
[2:59:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Protect otouto
[2:59:24] <Sokumotanaka> @Graxe_ doubt it izunami is both visual and literally some bs fire
[2:59:28] <AMstone776> already going better
[2:59:28] <MyNameIsRasus> Look! Real damage
[2:59:29] <Morning_Asakura> THIS IS LOOKING GOOD
[2:59:30] <kiharakun> this is such a fucking massive difference, holy shit
[2:59:34] <Hentailovr> Naruto doesn't have that many good moments, but ones it does have are worth it imo. I
[2:59:44] <DaikiWithDaShot> I wish this game were more detailed but Woolie already described his purpose for playing this. Doesn't care too much for the details of how things happened
[2:59:45] <%lordsdb> restart.....
[2:59:46] <Arkhamman367> ITACHI IS MY DAD
[2:59:49] <aracon_> yeah he missed some stars
[2:59:52] <optimasmaximas> @solidus_113 it had to with his mom or fake mom/foster mom but she actually was his mom and was a nun that was actually a spy and he killed her? I think it’s something along those lines. I remember him being in some orphanage thing with some nun type of people or some shit
[2:59:57] <Andrei11Droasca> Spam that super @woolieversus
[3:00:00] <danknugglit> Its fine
[3:00:03] <Sokumotanaka> @Arkhamman367 you should be proud
[3:00:04] <DaikiWithDaShot> Even though the details make it what it is, but that's just him
[3:00:04] <@Solidus_113> use the defense pill when he goes to do the wall attacks @WoolieVersus
[3:00:06] <thexiiilightning> He'll get another chance
[3:00:10] <thexiiilightning> to get all stars
[3:00:12] <%VidulaSaix> The damage this does with buffs LUL
[3:00:18] <Dragon_Batman> It usually is fine, the game gives enough QTE's to make that up
[3:00:26] <biomegabear> charge chakra
[3:00:29] <Hentailovr> Kabuto was taken from his orphanage, and then in the end, through years of lies and manpulation, forced to kill his foster mom
[3:00:49] <Hentailovr> who was sent to kill him. She was sent photos of him groving up, but they secretly relaced photos early on with different people
[3:00:53] <Andrei11Droasca> Kabuto still does more damage LUL
[3:01:01] <AMstone776> and his foster mom was forced to kill Kabuto.
[3:01:03] <Hentailovr> so she didn't recognize what kabuto looks like
[3:01:06] <%VidulaSaix> Cause hes buffed now as well
[3:01:06] <Arkhamman367> @Sokumotanaka he taught me a lot as a chunnin
[3:01:07] <rubbishbinge> Eat a defence
[3:01:07] <Hentailovr> and tries to kill him
[3:01:22] <AMstone776> tits a lot more fucked up things with that whole ordeal.
[3:01:26] <Dragon_Batman> This one isn't too bad
[3:01:29] <Dragon_Batman> at least
[3:01:31] <RayCSmooth> @WoolieVersus when he's in the air just double jump, it homes
[3:01:31] <%hitorio> It was a cool-ass method of deception. Literally condition his mother into thinking Kabuto was a different person using progressively different photos
[3:01:32] <optimasmaximas> @daikiwithdashot there’s a joke about that lol, it makes fun of woolie for wanting the super dummed down version but then wanting the super dummed down version to intricately explain the details LUL
[3:01:38] <AMstone776> "ITS"
[3:01:39] <%Lion_kun> Keep it all in.
[3:01:46] <Andrei11Droasca> You can do it again
[3:01:48] <AMstone776> not tits, jesus christ.
[3:02:03] <DaikiWithDaShot> You can punish with the Ult after substituting right?
[3:02:03] <metaloverlordx> did you know that if you spam press all the buttons on the controller while the qte is up you'll always get it right cause they didn't program punishing mistakes
[3:02:06] <Dragon_Batman> Nah they gave her wraps to cover it
[3:02:07] <+omenzazu> omgggg do a team ult
[3:02:11] <Solidnick18> nice
[3:02:18] <@Solidus_113> he did a couple times already @omenzazu
[3:02:26] <Morning_Asakura> he clearly doesnt have it
[3:02:29] <%hitorio> @AMstone776 Tits made their way into your sentence as a result of the universe balancing itself.
[3:02:36] <tookool5678> you can heal in these
[3:02:38] <%VidulaSaix> Hes fine
[3:02:41] <Hentailovr> Man, am I only one who wishes woolie watches a youtube Ultimate compilation after he does the games. So many ultimate jutsus are like Arksys levels of visual spectacle
[3:02:42] <%VidulaSaix> You get way more stars than you need
[3:02:44] <Hentailovr> I want woolie to see em
[3:02:46] <thexiiilightning> he's good
[3:02:48] <Sokumotanaka> I wish they made fuck up QTE's like itachi would get stabbed in the head and fall over and shit like that
[3:02:53] <+omenzazu> @solidus_113 did he? I swear I never saw him
[3:02:58] <tookool5678> almost there.
[3:03:10] <thexiiilightning> dont jinx it!
[3:03:14] <%hitorio> @Hentailovr Honestly, I think the ultimate jutsus are >>>>>>> ArcSys' Instant Kills and Astral Finishes
[3:03:16] <aracon_> is this the run hggShaq ?
[3:03:16] <Arkhamman367> You can do it wools
[3:03:21] <AMstone776> Woolie and co were talking about gams now I somehow slip the milk bags in.

[3:03:28] <+omenzazu> never seen him do a ult on fire
[3:03:29] <Dragon_Batman> Nice backing away
[3:03:30] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio agreed
[3:03:31] <Morning_Asakura> is this it
[3:03:41] <+Grayhammatter> are we doing it?
[3:03:47] <biomegabear> please please please
[3:03:49] <Hentailovr> @hitorio some are but some are mixed back. One of the biggest problems wiht storm 3 is that due to story reasons you are forced to use storm 2 ultimates for so long...
[3:03:51] <aracon_> are you serious
[3:03:51] <%VidulaSaix> LUL
[3:03:53] <aracon_> oh noooooo

[3:04:33] <Morning_Asakura> SO CLOSE
[3:04:33] <%hitorio> @Hentailovr oh - even outside of story mode you couldn't use the full range of abilities? :O
[3:04:35] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio at least for the more special/unique op jutsu (like particle style) or the plot relevant ones (like sharingan, rinnegan, tailed beasts, etc.)
[3:04:36] <bevyrage> didn't win because the slap doesn't OTG
[3:04:38] <AMstone776> fool this game does not have OTGs
[3:04:40] <biomegabear> does retry get your stuff back?
[3:04:40] <DaikiWithDaShot> It sucks cause some ultimated do combo lol
[3:04:41] <bevyrage> that's bull
[3:04:42] <MasterDecoder> Chat Crazy Talked it

[3:05:19] <+Superbro64> WINDOWS doodCrazy
[3:05:19] <0rond> did y'all tell him this fight is bullshit and mad difficult? don't do combo just spam ults, it will take around 20
[3:05:20] <+ggbhtg> Windowsssssss
[3:05:22] <Hentailovr> @hitorio Basically, you were forced to play as storm 2 naruto for most of storm 3. And even when you play as STorm 3 one, you are stuck in permanent awakening mode. ANd don't get me wrong, that awakening is super flashy... but still
[3:05:23] <TheWashoutXY> The ultimate genjutsu goin right here
[3:05:24] <optimasmaximas> OH NO brownS NotLikeThis
[3:05:25] <thexiiilightning> Stream vod will work
[3:05:25] <%VidulaSaix> It's in the stream vod so worst case you still have that
[3:05:27] <mrpandabear437> you can just yoink twitch stream though
[3:05:28] <Dragon_Batman> As long as it happened after the cut
[3:05:30] <Arkhamman367> We hear you
[3:05:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Windows NotLikeThis
[3:05:32] <DeviousShadowArt> The Audio has fallen to the infinite Tsukuyomi
[3:05:32] <Solidnick18> man i am hungry
[3:05:35] <optimasmaximas> Shit man
[3:05:36] <R3c0n31> Stream is fine, could rip the audio worse comes to shove
[3:05:42] <bevyrage> fuck you kabuto, installing the windows update in the middle of a stream
[3:05:42] <%Exiliator> Yeah just grab the twitch VOD
[3:05:45] <TheWashoutXY> WIndows sucks ass
[3:05:45] <NinjaGentleman> the laptop is caught in the infinite tsukyomi
[3:05:46] <optimasmaximas> Hope this session isnt a wipe
[3:05:47] <Raldavar> the laptop is already caught in the ultimate genjutsu
[3:05:47] <Arek_1> The power of never turning off your PC. LUL
[3:05:48] <+ggbhtg> NEVER happened before, Stream Done Quick
[3:05:49] <%hitorio> @optimasmaximas yeah. If the supermove involves speed, impact, or scale, CyberConnect were kids in a candy shop
[3:05:52] <Andrei11Droasca> Just use the stream footage @woolieversus
[3:05:56] <rubbishbinge> just grab from the stream with fraps
[3:06:01] <+MrRabbles> well at least the vod exists on twitch
[3:06:05] <austinj24> The unknown restart is the problem here
[3:06:07] <BlackermanZX> Stream footage still good
[3:06:17] <%hitorio> @optimasmaximas on the other hand, we have stuff like Iruka's ultimate jutsu, where they did the best they had with scraps
[3:06:31] <+omenzazu> Shinanigan strikes again
[3:06:35] <+omenzazu> damn uchihas
[3:06:38] <Hentailovr> CC2 are great at choreography tbh. Like they have best choreographed supers in town. Choreograhy and cinematography... Some of team ultimates in rev and storm 4 are downright INSPIRED
[3:06:44] <Shishi1205> fuck windows
[3:06:44] <Hentailovr> in terms of directing and editing
[3:06:51] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio God those six path jutsus or the susanoo ones Kreygasm
[3:06:55] <Arkhamman367> Just use your Rinnegan min
[3:06:56] <Solidnick18> windows booo
[3:06:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Microsoftsukuyomi
[3:06:59] <TheWashoutXY> BibleThump BibleThump
[3:07:00] <BlackermanZX> I disabled windows update and STILL gave me a update prompt somehow
[3:07:07] <Andrei11Droasca> Wait ,then how the fuck dose Max do it ?
[3:07:12] <Alzero83> Good thing you didnt finish the fight
[3:07:12] <+Superbro64> reminder that series x is JUST a pc tower too Kappa
[3:07:13] <Raldavar> Iruka's ultimate should had been summoning Ninja Jesus to the everything within a 10 mile radius
[3:07:16] <%VidulaSaix> What's weird is that it does usually ask you to install and update, but eventually if you ignore it long enough it just automatically does it
[3:07:18] <+ggbhtg> USE Internet Explorer PLEASEEE
[3:07:20] <%VidulaSaix> Which defeats the whole point of asking
[3:07:22] <%VidulaSaix> It's so dumb
[3:07:24] <%hitorio> @optimasmaximas @Hentailovr After the stream I'm gonna search PornHub for Ultimate Jutsu compilations
[3:07:25] <rosabellamelantha> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:07:39] <+MrRabbles> infinite Microsoft Jutsu
[3:07:46] <Arkhamman367> Mr. Gyro Zeppeli you never cease to amaze
[3:07:48] <Dragon_Batman> You ususally have to re set the day you want it to reset manually
[3:07:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Is there no audacity for Linux?
[3:07:58] <%HarmlessCrow> woolieS woolieT
[3:08:00] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio yeah, kinda like how in the storm 2 LP they mentioned how sakura in the previous games had inner sakura for her ults cause she was LITERALLY never developed to have anything
[3:08:03] <%hitorio> It was also CyberConnect that finally convinced me: Okay, Tsunade is cool... she just requires the right hands
[3:08:03] <+freezydude> lytNOTIKETHIS
[3:08:05] <DaikiWithDaShot> Go Go Zeppeli
[3:08:11] <+ggbhtg> Max has been ducking Windows Updates for years, so who knows how it's working now
[3:08:11] <Hentailovr> I recommend the ones that have no UI and mute in-game bgm putting their own bgm on top, so it doesn't cut off between jutsus. Those are like fucing music videos. awesome
[3:08:17] <rheviel> Eternal Update Shenanigans
[3:08:23] <Arkhamman367> Aomine?
[3:08:25] <%HarmlessCrow> wooliePOYO Windows has activated its Izanagi
[3:08:28] <+omenzazu> @rheviel kek
[3:08:43] <optimasmaximas> @hitorio OMG! I just remembered that akatsuki team ult in 4 Kreygasm
[3:08:43] <Dragon_Batman> The pills barely last
[3:08:44] <0rond> did y'all tell him this fight is bullshit and mad difficult? don't do combo just spam ults, it will take around 20 @woolieversus
[3:08:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Insultingly low
[3:08:52] <Raldavar> we're already caught in the genjutsu loop bois
[3:08:52] <+Nobara> Switch to mint or ubuntu then
[3:09:08] <Hentailovr> BTw can I make an embarrassing confession? I kinda lke sakura. Kishimoto fucked up her writing intoo many places, but with the magic of time skip, she became a cool punch mom
[3:09:11] <%hitorio> @optimasmaximas I'm gonna need a refresher on those Team Ults. I might open a tab and watch those right now
[3:09:12] <Dragon_Batman> Like it would be more useful to use the pill just before your gonna get hit
[3:09:12] <BlackermanZX> Fuck the windows update doodBait
[3:09:13] <Alzero83> @WoolieVersus When bosses are covered in their Blue Energy, Ultimates cant hit them so dont waste chakra trying
[3:09:36] <+DiabloDeAzul> Pepega Just use linux Pepega
[3:09:46] <%VidulaSaix> Technology NotLikeThis
[3:09:51] <+CarlosEoM> big HOLD ON
[3:09:52] <Alzero83> Techical Difficulties
[3:10:05] <Shishi1205> the wheel to decide the fate
[3:10:05] <Lionkevinson> Damn
[3:10:07] <%generalve> WOOLIE ITS OKAY
[3:10:07] <DaikiWithDaShot> @hentailovr I wish she were cool punch mom from the start. Would've loved that
[3:10:16] <%hitorio> @Hentailovr nothing to be embarassed about; perfectly fine to me. :D
[3:10:19] <Andrei11Droasca> Woolie is getting it from all angels today PixelBob
[3:10:23] <Alicesnekter> just call your tech savvy nephew
[3:10:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:10:25] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> woff
[3:10:27] <%generalve> people usually are master stremaers til year 3
[3:10:31] <Dragon_Batman> Woof indeed
[3:10:40] <rheviel> BegWan
[3:10:41] <%hitorio> Sakura being badass genjutsu god like she was hyped up to have potential for from the start is what I'd have liked her to become
[3:10:42] <+Superbro64> Kabuto is making us sustain PHYSCOLOGICAL damage
[3:10:48] <Hentailovr> Tbh in Sakura's defence. I would hate myself when I was 16 too. I bet she fucking fumes every time she remembers herself from shippuden
[3:10:49] <+Raidou24> @Alzero83 False he's landed 3 ults this stream
[3:10:52] <Jakev91489> Hey Wools and chat!
[3:10:53] <Arkhamman367> Who's the Virgil of Naruto?
[3:11:01] <DaikiWithDaShot> @hitorio That's the main dissappointment
[3:11:04] <Hentailovr> teenagers suck, and everyone who has ever been one can attest to that
[3:11:07] <%generalve> hi
[3:11:09] <%VidulaSaix> technology is a joy aint it 4Head
[3:11:13] <Alzero83> @Raidou24 im thinking Awakening modes
[3:11:16] <+Superbro64> HeyGuys
[3:11:18] <danknugglit> Hi :)
[3:11:24] <Dragon_Batman> heyo
[3:11:29] <beno113> ! LAPTOP AT RISK!
[3:11:31] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> oof
[3:11:33] <rheviel> Rrrrrrroll with the difficulties
[3:11:40] <Shishi1205> yeah dont risk it
[3:11:43] <Arkhamman367> Came back from watching the video on youtube
[3:11:51] <%hitorio> Oh damn
[3:11:52] <DaikiWithDaShot> If Sakura had genjutsu like she did in some of the games she would've been so cool
[3:12:07] <DaikiWithDaShot> and actually useful
[3:12:08] <Arkhamman367> !SANITY AT RISK!
[3:12:13] <+Raidou24> @Alzero83 He has landed ults this phase where kabuto is awakened
[3:12:20] <%hitorio> Imagine Sakura vs Itachi... with the story motivation being that she cares about Sasuke and is confronting his brother
[3:12:27] <DaikiWithDaShot> Minh? MIIIINH
[3:12:30] <%jazzcrasher> Man that sounds awful
[3:12:31] <Andrei11Droasca> Fuck that
[3:12:35] <%hitorio> and she's the only prodigy who can give Itachi a genjutsu run for his money without the sharingan
[3:12:36] <Hentailovr> I might also be biased cuz I like her shippuden and the last designs. I lie the way she has bare arms but gloves on her hands. It punctuated the point of impact when she punches things
[3:12:39] <%VidulaSaix> PC, good decision
[3:12:47] <Hentailovr> it's like having a hammer head on the end of a wooden handle
[3:12:49] <%generalve> pc is good
[3:12:51] <@Solidus_113> Storm 4 on PC?
[3:12:53] <Dragon_Batman> The Ult isn't fast until he has support built up really
[3:12:55] <%VidulaSaix> Yeah
[3:12:57] <Alzero83> Do you record Game Footage and Audio Footage Seperate for the Channel? @WoolieVersus
[3:13:05] <+omenzazu> wasnt the pc version know to shit itself?
[3:13:06] <@Solidus_113> It's got a 60fps mode, so that's great
[3:13:07] <Raldavar> genjutsu would've been cool if bullcrap eyeballs didn't shit all over them
[3:13:09] <Jakev91489> Dang, Reggie looking like Childish Gambino over there lol
[3:13:10] <Arkhamman367> Sakura has always been Boring in every media
[3:13:14] <%VidulaSaix> PC worked fine for me so dunno
[3:13:16] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> good luck
[3:13:17] <Andrei11Droasca> NUNS 4 is way better
[3:13:20] <+berserkscarlett> No worries
[3:13:20] <MyNameIsRasus> gl
[3:13:24] <DaikiWithDaShot> @hentailovr No problem if you like it you like it. I find her design basic in Shippuden but I live her last and Boruto design
[3:13:28] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[3:13:29] <BlackermanZX> All good
[3:13:29] <zayasu> SourPls
[3:13:32] <+Yung_Booker> snark1P
[3:13:33] <@Solidus_113> you can brute force through the problems if you have strong enough PC
[3:13:34] <%hitorio> @Hentailovr that aesthetic liking makes sense. My issue with Sakura's fighting style is that, because she's too strong, she's destined to never succeed at her punches
[3:13:34] <rubbishbinge> kk
[3:13:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PIANO
[3:13:36] <%VidulaSaix> Damn the Jojo Jebaited
[3:13:37] <MyNameIsRasus> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[3:13:37] <danknugglit> No worries
[3:13:40] <NarcissistCactus> big hold on
[3:13:42] <biomegabear> Should I stay watching the stream or finish shenmue

[3:14:18] <SilverFaustX> just saw star wars, was great
[3:14:19] <%hitorio> Sakura's daughter, who I was initially hyped for - I was also disappointed when I found out she was another punch girl... with sharingan.
[3:14:21] <AMstone776> big errors
[3:14:27] <Arkhamman367> A man of class I see
[3:14:28] <+omenzazu> I wanna see woolie reaction to Killer Bees raps
[3:14:31] <Dante_Namikaze1> how late am i?
[3:14:33] <%hitorio> because now she's going to be doublefucked by fight-plot
[3:14:36] <Hentailovr> btw did woolie say if he plans to do boruto part of storm 4? Cuz that has adventure modeagain -_-

[3:14:41] <+freezydude> woolie is super wrong about that vomit
[3:14:43] <0rond> song name
[3:14:45] <Dante_Namikaze1> did I miss anything?
[3:14:45] <0rond> plz
[3:14:51] <+CoronetChris> Did errors mean no more and we leave or are they coming back?
[3:14:51] <%hitorio> This is the Devil May Cry 5 shop theme
[3:14:52] <Valizard> @0rond Nico's shop (DMC 5 OST)
[3:14:53] <NiktenKing> A lot of boss attempts
[3:14:58] <rubbishbinge> Sarada being physically strong is the dumbest thing ever
[3:14:59] <Jakev91489> I'm losing it over Woolie's headband just saying LEAF
[3:15:08] <+omenzazu> I wanna see the guys see Killer bee spitting with those losers dancing in the back
[3:15:10] <Arek_1> @CoronetChris They'll be back in a bit.
[3:15:12] <NiktenKing> Other than that. We've seen the boss attempts like 10 times
[3:15:14] <NiktenKing> or so
[3:15:21] <Hentailovr> Kabuto is arguably the hardest boss battle in the franchize. Only one close is stupid fight with giant bijus at the end of storm 3 proper
[3:15:30] <+CoronetChris> @arek_1 Thank you.
[3:15:30] <0rond> @woolieversus in general please consider adding song name to the overlay
[3:15:33] <%hitorio> Sarada having the level of battle finesse and craftsmanship that genin Sasuke had was what I was excited for. To bring back that level of badassery
[3:15:37] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> and chat said DLC was 45 minutes
[3:15:48] <Hentailovr> Sarada is best Kombst Kid, don't @ me
[3:15:52] <Raldavar> what we keep forgetting is that 99% of all Uchiha are shit tier and the good ones can be counted on one hand spreader through multiple generations
[3:15:58] <Hentailovr> *Kombat Kid

[3:16:32] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> woolieDATTEBAYO_BW
[3:16:34] <Shishi1205> you got punked by kabuto but it seems like everyone else too
[3:16:36] <+chubbypencil> this fight looks like a lot of bs
[3:16:36] <0rond> this fight is straight bullshit
[3:16:37] <%hitorio> @Raldavar nah; if that was the case, the Uchiha wouldn've have been the Top 2 strongest clans in the world before the era of villages
[3:16:39] <Hentailovr> but they are best friends so it's basically like getting a double package
[3:16:42] <cham52> do it in 40 woolz
[3:16:46] <CozyGUNNA> its difficult fr
[3:16:50] <Shishi1205> YAY

[3:19:06] <rheviel> nice
[3:19:09] <+fateirony> so concentrated he forgot the game camera LUL
[3:19:18] <Andrei11Droasca> The quality we deserve Kappa
[3:19:23] <MyNameIsRasus> I don't get it. He's still doing shit damage.
[3:19:26] <NiktenKing> You can look up why your PC restarts looking at the Event ID's in your PC's log
[3:19:28] <0rond> @woolieversus @chesterr01 woolie don't do combos just spam ults it will take 20 but that's the sainest way
[3:19:28] <Hentailovr> so, how many times did Woolie run RIGHT into that snake? he was doing that back when I was watching VOD before realizing he was actually live right now
[3:19:33] <%VidulaSaix> That fucknig Dylan reference LUL
[3:19:38] <NiktenKing> typically has like a one sentence comment
[3:19:41] <Jakev91489> STINGAH
[3:19:50] <Shishi1205> I've seen people suggest up combos
[3:20:11] <%VidulaSaix> Yeyeye
[3:20:15] <+freezydude> its because you have the support drive (the red meter)
[3:20:17] <Hentailovr> Bounces are cuz your team gauge is up
[3:20:25] <MyNameIsRasus> Bounces happen when the Burst Attack gauge is full
[3:20:27] <+freezydude> using the team super removes it
[3:20:30] <%VidulaSaix> Its because your assist gauge is full
[3:20:31] <Andrei11Droasca> Darknes ,imprisoning me
[3:20:32] <Shishi1205> ghost time reggie
[3:20:41] <Dragon_Batman> That is true, does different combos like up or down do anymore damage than others?
[3:20:49] <Shishi1205> you have to build it up
[3:20:50] <MyNameIsRasus> Not if you want more bounces
[3:20:54] <%VidulaSaix> Only spend if you're sure itll finish him
[3:20:59] <zenith0111> THAT'S NOT HOW YOU USE A SWORD
[3:21:16] <Arek_1> The max Support Gauge will run out after a while.
[3:21:18] <jonathandemel> It's a snake head, give it a bit of slack
[3:21:20] <Arkhamman367> Got EEM
[3:21:21] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You should spend it in a normal match, because it runs out after a while
[3:21:28] <aracon_> good shit
[3:21:30] <+Nobara> does it even matter if a corpse goesblind with the reanimation jutsu?
[3:21:31] <%VidulaSaix> He found the tech
[3:21:32] <+MrRabbles> woolie has found the meta
[3:21:34] <aracon_> this is the run
[3:21:38] <+Kiiper> Woolie is killing these QTEs now
[3:21:40] <Hentailovr> Man I really wished woolie would just find someone who knows about this game to co-host. I used to be obsessive about this seirs so I can still recall indivdual changes to character combos between games, and even small bug fixes. BEcause of it, it gets really frustrating to see them be confused about something that can be explained easily. Anybody like that in Canada? XD
[3:21:40] <biomegabear> is itachi awakened?
[3:21:41] <+kewlmyc> WE GOT STRATS, BOIS
[3:21:45] <deadshot27> This is the way
[3:21:48] <0rond> @chesterr01 the support gauge will run put, use it for the ult
[3:21:52] <%VidulaSaix> Gauge uis gone

[3:22:16] <Morning_Asakura> this is the one
[3:22:16] <Arek_1> There's more meta to be found. Tilt cancels, Ninja Move Cancels into Ultimate Jutsu, and probably more.
[3:22:17] <Arkhamman367> Remember block?
[3:22:24] <Dragon_Batman> You could run away and uses support till it comes back

[3:24:57] <Crashfan01> Kabuto with the zoning tactics
[3:25:03] <Shishi1205> you might be able to spam the tilt attack for invulnerability
[3:25:03] <Dragon_Batman> LUL that V skill 2 is nuts
[3:25:06] <damienlunas> Use the Demon Wind Shuriken
[3:25:07] <Dante_Namikaze1> I can't believe my phone is so shit it can barely run the stream at 160p
[3:25:08] <0rond> don't do combo just spam ults @woolieversus @chesterr01
[3:25:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Kaubto SUPER had this
[3:25:16] <Hentailovr> @OldManDeckardCain I just watched daigo react to his v-skill II earlier today. Jesus christ, that's busted
[3:25:16] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Try maybe blocking some of the rock walls?
[3:25:20] <Andrei11Droasca> This is some SNK shot LUL
[3:25:21] <jonathandemel> Bad run
[3:25:22] <Zebroneath> Madara Uchi-WHO?
[3:25:23] <+freezydude> if you want the wallbounces from your fireball you gotta use your assists more
[3:25:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Bad run
[3:25:28] <%VidulaSaix> He knows
[3:25:33] <$trueherobappo> coward kabuto
[3:25:34] <+bread_assassin> Reminder this fight started out with Woolie calling Kabuto weak
[3:25:36] <+omenzazu> woolie needs to take a step back and fill up that meter
[3:25:39] <danknugglit> "kabuto has no chance in this fight"
[3:25:39] <Arkhamman367> YOU'RE GETTING SLOPPY
[3:25:42] <MyNameIsRasus> It would be hype for a comeback tho
[3:25:44] <Raldavar> Kabuto singlehandedly carrying this WHOLE ninja war
[3:25:45] <OldManDeckardCain> Who knew putting airdashes on a single char in a grounded game would matter Kappa
[3:25:50] <cumurasame> are you going to go straight to storm 4?
[3:25:50] <biomegabear> Yeah chat helps as much as it coukd
[3:25:52] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe running away and using support might help
[3:25:54] <+Spoon_fresh> There we go...
[3:25:55] <+Vikken141> I think Woolie is under Itachi gengetsu too, it just keeps repeating Kappa
[3:26:01] <Iggeh0> he's whooping him this round lol
[3:26:03] <+Dhamilt> @Arkhamman367 shhhh to be that guy....
[3:26:08] <rubbishbinge> restart
[3:26:09] <+Dhamilt> *dont
[3:26:17] <@Solidus_113> Maybe Kabuto's not strong, Itachi's just weak as a reanimation OpieOP
[3:26:20] <+freezydude> @VidulaSaix if he knows he'd be using sasuke more lytBEATSME
[3:26:21] <+omenzazu> @raldavar yeah pretty much if you think about it... madara would have no chance to get as far as he did without him
[3:26:26] <%VidulaSaix> He does know
[3:26:27] <Jakev91489> Dang, this is rough
[3:26:31] <%VidulaSaix> He literally did it last attempt
[3:26:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Nice dodges
[3:26:49] <Hentailovr> I mean, if Nagato didn't bail.
[3:26:50] <danknugglit> Earth style te- earth style terr- earth style ter-
[3:26:59] <Hentailovr> Original plan was for Nagato to revive madara was it not?
[3:27:05] <Arkhamman367> @Dhamilt Sorry new to this chat
[3:27:07] <Hentailovr> with the jutsu he instead used to revive everyone in Kooha
[3:27:08] <Arek_1> @Hentailovr Yup.
[3:27:10] <Hentailovr> *Konoha
[3:27:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Demon Wind Shur- Demon Wind Shur- Demon Wind Shur-
[3:27:25] <jonathandemel> @Solidus_113 The fuck? No, he's stronger than he ever was, since he's not sick
[3:27:35] <Crashfan01> Jirobou balding at 14. poor kid
[3:27:36] <Jakev91489> Dang the Stinger is strong af
[3:27:48] <zenith0111> I can feel Woolie sweating calebS
[3:27:49] <%JohnAtDawn> You should probably throw this run
[3:27:55] <dundore77> and he also has infinite chakra because he's a zombie.
[3:27:59] <+MrRabbles> And that time
[3:28:07] <@Solidus_113> I mean this as a joke because the fight is so hard
[3:28:08] <+omenzazu> if nagato ain't change his ways he would of died in that tree
[3:28:17] <+omenzazu> by naruto's hands
[3:28:24] <jonathandemel> @dundore77 I never got that. Do they have infinite chakra because of their connection to the Pure World or something?
[3:28:35] <+Superbro64> this is like dante vs vergil, except if the combat. gameplay was mediocre at best
[3:28:46] <%JohnAtDawn> @omenzazu I mean yeah? What else would he have done
[3:28:50] <MyNameIsRasus> Izanami's a bitch
[3:28:53] <Hentailovr> Did woolie notice?
[3:29:00] <+kaiju7544> Woolie. improvise, adapt, overcome.
[3:29:01] <Hentailovr> that it was the same horn?
[3:29:02] <Jakev91489> What does the secret action do?
[3:29:10] <tookool5678> heal
[3:29:11] <0rond> reanimated itachi's got the best looking ult in the game imo, y'all should use it more
[3:29:15] <+kyh9> CLOSE
[3:29:17] <zenith0111> @jakev91489 Shhhhh Haha2020
[3:29:21] <+deidriel> he starts izanami when he does secret action
[3:29:24] <+omenzazu> @johnatdawn that's not wa
[3:29:26] <jonathandemel> OOOH
[3:29:30] <dundore77> @jonathandemel thats what im assuming or since chakra has something to do with the stamina you have based on the pre time skip stuff its because they can't tire too
[3:29:37] <%VidulaSaix> Dont say shit before it happens chat
[3:29:40] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RayCSmooth
[3:29:44] <MyNameIsRasus> F
[3:29:45] <Arkhamman367> I don't think woolie know how to actually use an ult
[3:29:47] <Solidnick18> christ
[3:29:48] <zenith0111> F
[3:29:51] <Andrei11Droasca> "ESSIE MODE UNLOCKED"

[3:29:52] <$eco419> F
[3:29:53] <+omenzazu> what's being contested... its Nagatos and kabutos usefullness
[3:29:55] <+RayDaug> The Fume Knight of Anime
[3:29:55] <Arkhamman367> F
[3:29:57] <Dragon_Batman> He knows how to use the ult
[3:30:03] <jonathandemel> @dundore77 Yeah but chakra is also half soul energy, so maybe both a bit?
[3:30:12] <%gatorafan> woolieCHAN_HF woolieCHAN woolieCHAN_HF woolieCHAN
[3:30:12] <rubbishbinge> You can always stay down
[3:30:13] <Arblaster_> Is there an easy mode you can switch to?
[3:30:19] <0rond> don't bother doing combo, just dodge, charge and ult
[3:30:20] <+freezydude> This is the easy mode.
[3:30:21] <Hentailovr> @Arblaster_ no
[3:30:22] <+JacknZack27> Can you substitute on the wall attack?
[3:30:25] <$trueherobappo> or right
[3:30:29] <Hentailovr> This was CC2 going "button masher? well git gud"
[3:30:31] <helidzz> use substitution on jirobo
[3:30:32] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> How long can lay on the ground
[3:30:33] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus try to substitute?
[3:30:34] <danknugglit> Just dont get hit 4Head
[3:30:36] <%VidulaSaix> Can you use the crow for them @WoolieVersus ? I think it has iframes
[3:30:40] <Jakev91489> DO COMBO
[3:30:47] <%PacManTheSoulEater> PacManTheSoulEater subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:30:48] <Arkhamman367> I mean he charges the bar all the way when he just needs to do it to that little line
[3:30:48] <%hitorio> Itachi reviving to fight along Sasuke is like Kamina fighting alongside Simon. Except discount. :P
[3:30:50] <rheviel> you can substitute the wall.
[3:30:50] <+omenzazu> and I'm not too sure but wouldn't nagato just fully revive people? I believe Kabutos zonbies are better
[3:30:56] <+BurkeBigsby> is dodging the only solution though?
[3:30:58] <SquigglyLizard> Thanks for the HahaTurtledove @pacmanthesouleater
[3:31:04] <+MrRabbles> i wonder if crows can get through the rock
[3:31:04] <bethore> Spam assist until support gauge is half full and spam the fireball bounce
[3:31:08] <DaikiWithDaShot> @arkhamman367 that's true no one's mentioned that to him yet
[3:31:17] <Jakev91489> This ones rough
[3:31:19] <DaikiWithDaShot> wastes time
[3:31:21] <0rond> @chesterr01 please tell to at least try going with ult spam, I'm sorry but that's the only way I was able to beat this fight without wanting to end it all
[3:31:23] <Hentailovr> @omenzazu Yeah, they are better, but Madara doesn't really care about edo tensei benefits, his plans are beyond that. wait for storm 4
[3:31:24] <BlackermanZX> Where is the demon wind shuriken when you need it
[3:31:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:31:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie, your Burst Attack gauge only fills up if you use your assists
[3:31:40] <EndgameContent> Does Woolie know how to do grabs?
[3:31:40] <+omenzazu> @hentailovr I played them all
[3:31:41] <%VidulaSaix> There we go
[3:31:47] <danknugglit> There we go
[3:31:50] <jonathandemel> @BlackermanZX It's been replaced with "There you go."
[3:31:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I dont remeber this fight being so hard
[3:31:57] <%gatorafan> I mean, all this runs are probably canon. Kappa
[3:32:02] <%VidulaSaix> Kappa
[3:32:09] <foghornleghorn55> Kabuto > Fume Knight
[3:32:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:32:12] <Hentailovr> oh god Demon Wind Shuriken spam. I remmeber trying to S-rank every fight in storm 3. It was "spam up combo" and "demon wind shuriken" that whole fight. I actually chuckled when woolie was using same tactics. Did chat tip him off?
[3:32:25] <Dragon_Batman> He really just needs to work on not taking hits during Bone drill and rocks
[3:32:31] <Jakev91489> Fuck you, Fume Knight is the bane of my exsistance
[3:32:40] <%jazzcrasher> LETS Go JUSTIN! SwiftRage
[3:32:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh god
[3:32:53] <%JohnAtDawn> YEAH
[3:32:54] <Solidnick18> wow
[3:32:55] <Arek_1> There's a specific reason that Madara wanted to be fully revived through the Rinne Tensei no Jutsu as opposed to being revived through the Edo Tensei.
[3:33:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They should just throw a Pokeball at him
[3:33:05] <%VidulaSaix> The team up tech
[3:33:05] <Andrei11Droasca> The infinite substitution is probably the most bulshit part of this fight
[3:33:09] <Raldavar> any reason why Woolie doesn't air dash during the drill part?
[3:33:26] <+omenzazu> ultttt
[3:33:28] <jonathandemel> OOOO
[3:33:29] <damienlunas> They should throw a Demon Wind Shuriken at him
[3:33:31] <Dragon_Batman> Hah that hit him
[3:33:31] <+MrRabbles> nice
[3:33:31] <MyNameIsRasus> @BallerSwagBro9k "Look Vegeta! It's a Pokémon!"
[3:33:32] <%JohnAtDawn> GOT EM
[3:33:32] <Solidnick18> yooooo
[3:33:33] <0rond> do you really need to Chakra dash on the bounceback? doesn't normal dash suffice?
[3:33:36] <Shishi1205> read like a book
[3:33:36] <reasonance> blows my fuckin mind that the glasses bitch with his ninja info cards turned out to be one of the most important villains of the whole series
[3:33:36] <Jakev91489> YEYEYEYYE
[3:33:37] <DaikiWithDaShot> good shit Woolz
[3:33:38] <Dragon_Batman> Run and build support?
[3:33:38] <%VidulaSaix> Good run
[3:33:39] <LeBlanc233> lotta damage
[3:33:40] <+omenzazu> wait cant he do the team ult?
[3:33:46] <%ultrasparkseid> I wonder if he can do his ult after a whiffed Terra shield
[3:33:48] <jonathandemel> @omenzazu Not in 3
[3:33:50] <tookool5678> he is doing it.
[3:33:50] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh it didn't eat it
[3:33:51] <+omenzazu> gotta press 3x triangle
[3:34:00] <Arkhamman367> Isn't teamult in the next game?
[3:34:01] <Hentailovr> well ther goes the drive gauge
[3:34:07] <@Solidus_113> @omenzazu he's done it half a dozen times in other attempts
[3:34:13] <Dragon_Batman> Interesting, that's a shame
[3:34:16] <jonathandemel> 2 BARS
[3:34:16] <Hentailovr> @Arkhamman367 Team ult existed since storm 2, it just enver had unique team animations
[3:34:19] <0rond> there are still none special team ults in this one
[3:34:23] <RayCSmooth> @WoolieVersus use the ninja move for god sake
[3:34:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> is this harder than Darkeater Midr
[3:34:27] <+omenzazu> @jonathandemel you sure I cant remember... I've seen him light up on fore that's why
[3:34:34] <Hentailovr> in this game it still exists, but it's just generic melee combo than solo ult
[3:34:37] <0rond> he is using ninja move, chill
[3:34:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli HAHAHAHA no
[3:34:45] <%jazzcrasher> Lets not worry about it right now
[3:34:51] <rubbishbinge> It's ok
[3:34:51] <jonathandemel> You talking about the bit where they do normal attacks one after another?
[3:34:56] <Arkhamman367> Oh well I guess never really saw it then
[3:35:20] <+omenzazu> @hentailovr in just saying cuz it shows 5 seconds of a different start to the ultimate
[3:35:25] <Dragon_Batman> This game doesn't have the all out team attacks yet
[3:35:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CMON ALMOST THERE
[3:35:27] <Arek_1> Nice whiff punish.
[3:35:29] <%gatorafan> woolieCHAN WE DO IT woolieCHAN_HF

[3:35:44] <zenith0111> WTF

[3:35:47] <MutedMimic> oof

[3:35:51] <Darkrenai> Oof
[3:35:54] <Hentailovr> @omenzazu yeah they actually show you that part of animation when you watch ults in gallery... except storm 3. They fucked it up in storm 3 for some reason. But literally every next game fixed it again
[3:35:54] <Div_the_Penguin> oof here we go again
[3:35:55] <danknugglit> Too agressive

[3:42:39] <gordieda20> Aw
[3:42:42] <jonathandemel> Fuck I need to go asleep
[3:42:43] <thexiiilightning> Keep calm Woolie, get your chakra up
[3:42:43] <Arkhamman367> Dash in after the sub
[3:42:44] <danknugglit> Lame it out super hard
[3:42:46] <thexiiilightning> dont rush
[3:42:46] <+KeithTheHuman> you gotta back off
[3:42:46] <Solidnick18> choke jerk
[3:42:47] <Andrei11Droasca> NotLikeThis
[3:42:48] <biomegabear> itachi's stubby arms catch reach
[3:42:49] <MutedMimic> Running into his fist FeelsBadMan
[3:42:49] <Arek_1> That's weird. Shouldn't Edo Itachi have Amaterasu as his jutsu?
[3:42:51] <NinjaGentleman> maybe
[3:42:51] <+kyh9> fireball jutsu
[3:42:52] <@Solidus_113> Use Sasuke to cover your chakra charge
[3:42:53] <Arblaster_> Kabuto is the hardest boss in gaming LUL
[3:42:53] <%HarmlessCrow> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:42:53] <%VidulaSaix> Double tap X to dash in normal
[3:42:53] <Dragon_Batman> Yea, I would say back out sometimes
[3:42:53] <+omenzazu> forgets to charge, to keep a eye on your logs
[3:42:55] <BlackermanZX> No chakra and subs dont go in
[3:42:58] <0rond> don't do combo just spam ult @chesterr01 @woolieversus
[3:42:59] <Darkrenai> Subs come back over time, yeah
[3:43:02] <Hentailovr> Woolie is nearly done with the game. Also woolie : Maybe I should charge my chakra
[3:43:02] <Fart_Explosions> This stream is stuck in a loop. This must be one of Itachi's techniques.
[3:43:02] <shockmaster3> maybe if I run into the ryu's fireball it will work
[3:43:03] <NinjaGentleman> like cross tekken
[3:43:05] <Bunnykinght96> Yeah u need to lame it out to win
[3:43:06] <rubbishbinge> Yeah
[3:43:08] <reasonance> so is the fireball his only decent damage?
[3:43:12] <@Solidus_113> we're all in a genjutsu
[3:43:12] <%VidulaSaix> No
[3:43:12] <ShiningMeteor78> I remember itachi's tilt is a dope dash attack, other than that yeah itachi has no range
[3:43:25] <NinjaGentleman> we all in the Izanami
[3:43:28] <DonStylow> If you wanna win this fight play Kirishimas theme in the background. With Red Riot music there is no way of losing a fight.
[3:43:33] <+Manderson1998> Woolie, use your jutsu if you can rather than melee
[3:43:34] <MyNameIsRasus> fireball bounce is apparently the best way to go, but it uses up chakra real fast
[3:43:38] <+ScrapSentinel> does woolie even know about tilts?
[3:43:39] <Hentailovr> Only way to stop it is for woolie to accept he lost XD
[3:43:41] <+bigwoodswinger> try throw after sub maybe?
[3:43:42] <Andrei11Droasca> DMD Virgil is easier than this
[3:43:42] <@Solidus_113> We're going to keep failing this for the next 72 hours
[3:43:50] <%VidulaSaix> Flick and button yes
[3:43:50] <+KeithTheHuman> you gotta quit mashing normals after subbing, you either have to walk up first or back up
[3:43:54] <%VidulaSaix> It should have iframes
[3:43:59] <+MrRabbles> its free
[3:43:59] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You can use Sasuke assist to cover you while you regain resources
[3:44:01] <dodgy_dingo_> is itachi susanoo mode disabled for this fight?
[3:44:02] <+freezydude> do that after a sub is your best bet probably
[3:44:05] <MyNameIsRasus> WHO PUT US IN THIS GENJUTSU woolieS
[3:44:07] <aracon_> hggShaq
[3:44:10] <rheviel> i frame crows

[3:44:31] <BlackermanZX> The crows seems pretty good
[3:44:39] <+ScrapSentinel> tilt moves are so good
[3:44:47] <EndgameContent> You gotta Crumpet Dash
[3:44:50] <Raldavar> might as well reset if he lost this much health while Kabuto still has 3 bars
[3:44:53] <%VidulaSaix> Its difficult to do, he's right
[3:44:58] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus flick, neutral, button.

[3:46:29] <Darkrenai> He's trying to jump away

[3:52:40] <%Lion_kun> It's funny how they left out Kabuto's flashback in the game yet I feel far more invested because of the better choreography
[3:52:41] <+omenzazu> literally a hour later
[3:52:42] <Zeldrick> ... what the fuck?
[3:52:43] <Jakev91489> Those losses were cannon
[3:52:47] <%senoue> How is Itachi both Bruno and Giorno?
[3:52:47] <trueherobappo> fuckin dope shit
[3:52:50] <$Chumblago13> its even more busted because you can't get out unless you earnestly repent and change your ways
[3:52:50] <wendigo172> Woolie should watch Kabuto’s flashback
[3:52:50] <0rond> it needs very specific set up and conditions, and will only work on very specific opponents
[3:52:52] <Makoiscutest> so stupid

[3:53:16] <%Lion_kun> True Man's World
[3:53:17] <mrpandabear437> imagine not being born an uchiha
[3:53:19] <MyNameIsRasus> It does cost an eye, but yeah
[3:53:21] <rheviel> Itachi is broken
[3:53:22] <Sp3ctre48> Itachi's only handicap was having ninja aids
[3:53:24] <mrpandabear437> why even bother
[3:53:24] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:53:25] <%gatorafan> woolieCHAN_HF Uchigang! woolieCHAN
[3:53:25] <+texflexrex> it sacrifices a shraingan
[3:53:25] <Jetsfantasy> It's Mandem with GER's Loops
[3:53:27] <%hitorio> This ability is Kishimoto just freestyling. This move requires super specific conditions to do, but of course it applies to this situation
[3:53:28] <BlackermanZX> AND SUSAN
[3:53:29] <DonStylow> I Dio gone to Heaven not even more OP?
[3:53:29] <Dragon_Batman> This does use up an eye completely but it is super busted
[3:53:32] <aracon_> time loop on top of susan on top of eternal flame on top of invincible crows on top of genjutsu
[3:53:34] <+fateirony> C WutFace
[3:53:34] <sphereshots12> But wait there's more
[3:53:34] <shockmaster3> there is a way to get out of it
[3:53:35] <+killogram123> it costs a whole eye to do and has alot of prerequisites @WoolieVersus
[3:53:35] <+ggbhtg> Every loss was a part of the narrative LUL @woolieversus
[3:53:37] <%sshen> Izanami makes your eye worthless and can never be used for anything ago, it has actual drawbacks.
[3:53:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YAGURA?!
[3:53:48] <aracon_> itachi is LITERALLY BUSTED
[3:53:48] <+omenzazu> he can only use it one time
[3:53:48] <Shishi1205> not only
[3:53:49] <Arblaster_> Everyone with a mangekyo can use that power btw LUL
[3:53:49] <saiyan24675> How did Itachi get ninja aids again
[3:53:52] <dodgy_dingo_> Imagine beating uchiha eugenics with strong wood
[3:53:52] <%gatorafan> All the runs were canon LUL
[3:53:54] <+ggbhtg> Yagura huh
[3:53:54] <Jetsfantasy> Izanami and Izanagi costs an eye
[3:53:55] <shockmaster3> you can escape the loop too
[3:53:56] <+texflexrex> get confused
[3:53:57] <wendigo172> Izanami even ruins EMS
[3:53:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Orochimaru couldn't Sage because of bodyswitching
[3:54:00] <biomegabear> its fucked
[3:54:02] <Orbeii> sharingan is fucking bullshit
[3:54:03] <+MrMagikarp007> sharingan does it all
[3:54:03] <Hentailovr> Itachi is Naruto's equivalent of jesus, so of course he is OP
[3:54:05] <lotharrio> Perfect illusions, full body giant chakra armor, unstoppable fire, limited reality warping and limited time looping.
[3:54:08] <Arkhamman367> @saiyan24675 At birth?
[3:54:09] <WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus you forever lose sight in one eye when izanami is used
[3:54:12] <Andrei11Droasca> Woolie you haven even seen the ninja Jesus shit yet @woolieversus
[3:54:12] <+Grayhammatter> it's fucked
[3:54:14] <%Lion_kun> wait till you get the sharingan that looks like an atomic sumbol
[3:54:17] <Arek_1> @Arblaster_ Izanagi and Izanami are generic Sharingan jutsus.
[3:54:20] <trueherobappo> Itachis time loop is a bit complicated cauee he has to set up the events for it to work properly..
[3:54:27] <danknugglit> Time stop no jutsu
[3:54:27] <aracon_> that's so stupid
[3:54:28] <gordieda20> Sharingan Is just the best
[3:54:35] <%senoue> That's a good name for GER's attack
[3:54:38] <saiyan24675> @arkhamman367 huh I must’ve skipped that chapter
[3:54:39] <DaikiWithDaShot> Kabuto: *gets confused*
[3:54:40] <%ozzrabbit> It gets dumber, trust me.
[3:54:41] <Arblaster_> Oh I see, so anyone with a sharingan at all can use it
[3:54:47] <dundore77> @Arek_1 thats never confirmed every single person who has used it in the show has mangekyo
[3:54:51] <blue6sub6remnant6> Notice how many times you cut that horn off.
[3:54:58] <Arblaster_> And I think you can use isanami once for each eye too
[3:55:02] <Shishi1205> izanami was abused by uchihas long ago to change the future
[3:55:03] <dundore77> but it can take normal sharingan eyes
[3:55:04] <+ggbhtg> The game overs were CANON
[3:55:06] <Dragon_Batman> He knows the signs to use the Jutsu
[3:55:06] <MyNameIsRasus> the words are the hand seals
[3:55:07] <Jetsfantasy> He used Tsukuyomi to go into Kabuto's mind
[3:55:10] <thexiiilightning> Yep
[3:55:12] <+texflexrex> yeah he said the seals
[3:55:14] <theCoolChild> So in other words that second form fight was all just a loop
[3:55:15] <Shishi1205> To "predict"
[3:55:17] <Iggeh0> He told him the hand signs
[3:55:17] <tookool5678> yes
[3:55:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PATRIOTISM
[3:55:21] <thexiiilightning> He used Genjutsu to make Kabuto reveal the undo seals
[3:55:23] <@Solidus_113> THANKS, BOSS
[3:55:24] <+ggbhtg> He made kabuto just trll him
[3:55:25] <Arkhamman367> Itachi is the true OG
[3:55:27] <mankeyfigh> @dundore77 No Danzo's eyes didn't have Mangekyo
[3:55:28] <+MrRabbles> A TRUE PATRIOT

[4:03:01] <@Solidus_113> This fight it also in NUNS4
[4:03:02] <Dragon_Batman> You should still watch it cuz it covers a few things
[4:03:03] <spawnzie> Should Woolie watch Kabuto backstory?
[4:03:03] <Hentailovr> MAKEHIM WATCH KABUTO PAST
[4:03:04] <amavii> the anime version is so badly animated
[4:03:05] <rheviel> YOU SHOULD STILL WATCH IT
[4:03:05] <wendigo172> You should still watch it
[4:03:06] <+Vikken141> back storu
[4:03:06] <zayasu> kabuto backstory
[4:03:08] <dundore77> The fight is great in the anime too. Every fight once the kages show up is worth watching
[4:03:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Kabuto's backstory maybe?
[4:03:08] <NiktenKing> You need the Uchiha backstory
[4:03:08] <%JohnAtDawn> SHOW HIM KABUTO'S FLASHBACK
[4:03:11] <Malikwest11> STILL WATCH IT!!
[4:03:11] <tookool5678> maybe watch the Mardra fight
[4:03:11] <biomegabear> I must be catholic because we playin NUNS4
[4:03:12] <%hkarim94> explain izanami and izanagi
[4:03:14] <wendigo172> Kabuto’s backstory
[4:03:14] <NiktenKing> Kabuto's backstory
[4:03:15] <Hentailovr> @WoolieVersus watch kabuto flashback about his past!!!
[4:03:15] <0rond> @woolieversus @chesterr01 check the character select screen to see how important kabutob is
[4:03:17] <agenda23> You should see kabutos backstory
[4:03:18] <+GreenCMD> anime has some Itachi backstory
[4:03:18] <zayasu> @WoolieVersus kabutos backstory
[4:03:18] <Orbeii> NUNS4?
[4:03:19] <Arblaster_> Kabutos flashback was lame
[4:03:20] <aracon_> we did iiiiit
[4:03:20] <+freezydude> G ET C O N F U S E D
[4:03:20] <+ggbhtg> NUNS 4 in 2022 CONFIRMED
[4:03:20] <sphereshots12> Can you get more contacts
[4:03:20] <+omenzazu> your gooood
[4:03:21] <+Kiiper> it missed the whole memory scene
[4:03:23] <+Nickmobox> NUNS4 TIME BAYBEE
[4:03:25] <trueherobappo> in the anime its only like 4 episodes plus the filler of itachis story
[4:03:25] <+jpipeman> It doesn't have Kabuto's backstory, but that's not critical to understanding the story
[4:03:26] <BlackermanZX> Kabuto's backstory yeah
[4:03:26] <aracon_> NUNS4 THE END
[4:03:27] <bsmusic> There will do be homework, as there's a jump in story to 4
[4:03:28] <NiktenKing> YES
[4:03:28] <powerprotoman> time for the 4th nun
[4:03:29] <Dragon_Batman> You should watch it mostly cuz it covers Izanami and Izanagi
[4:03:29] <wendigo172> Also Itachi important flashbacks
[4:03:31] <NiktenKing> It DOES A LOT
[4:03:35] <0rond> CHECK THE CHARACTER SELECT SCREEN
[4:03:35] <Sedrelic> nuns 4 2021
[4:03:35] <Arek_1> @wendigo172 I just checked. Izanagi and Izanami don't need the Mangekyo Sharingan.
[4:03:35] <aracon_> THE FINAL GAME
[4:03:35] <%VidulaSaix> Storm 4 will explain it a bit more
[4:03:37] <djazo> nuns4 is the best one
[4:03:37] <awildgooseappears> an in depth explanation of izanami would be cool
[4:03:40] <+omenzazu> NUNS4 baby!!! LETS ROCK!
[4:03:42] <biomegabear> Is NUNS4 the end of the story?
[4:03:42] <Arkhamman367> Anime has izanami flashback
[4:03:45] <Bakefowl> When’s boruto
[4:03:47] <Dragon_Batman> It uses moments to setup points of the loop
[4:03:48] <Alzero83> its Inazami You Heathen , Not Requime
[4:03:48] <dundore77> Theres a trigger that happens. its when he cuts the horn
[4:03:48] <+GreenCMD> anime explained Shisui too
[4:03:49] <%jazzcrasher> We really doing NUN4 today?
[4:03:49] <+Nobara> the anime explains Kabuto's past more as well
[4:03:51] <@Solidus_113> 2.5 hours to Killer Instinct
[4:03:51] <+killogram123> it explains it now
[4:03:52] <helidzz> it did
[4:03:52] <+Vikken141> it did
[4:03:52] <trueherobappo> the anime explains izanami and goes into kabutos backstory

[4:04:00] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Itachi explains
[4:04:02] <Arkhamman367> It explains it here
[4:04:03] <austin9568> Muda Muda
[4:04:04] <tusk_act4> NUNS4 is the final game. It is also getting more DLC for some reason
[4:04:05] <rubbishbinge> Izanagi is you didn't win. Izanami is shut up tho.
[4:04:07] <thexiiilightning> Izanami was a jutsu made to stop Rogue Uchihas. It gets them stuck in a loop until they acknowledge the error of their ways.
[4:04:08] <reg806> did someone say NUNS4
[4:04:09] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> Izanami also permanently renders an eye useless
[4:04:10] <Dragon_Batman> IT exploains it when Kabuto is in it
[4:04:14] <Arblaster_> You sacrafice 1 sharingan eye to put someone in a timeloop
[4:04:16] <Dragon_Batman> or just after
[4:04:16] <NiktenKing> It uses sensory stimulation and hard focuses your mind on impactful events in a fight to put you on a loop
[4:04:17] <tookool5678> Should they watch the Mardra fight with kage?
[4:04:17] <Jetsfantasy> @Andrei11Droasca Woolie is going to lose his shit at Night Guy

[4:05:06] <bigbrothergannon> HahaThink
[4:05:08] <lotharrio> Really early, Orochimaru mentioned he wanted the Sharingan, because it would let him do basically everything.
[4:05:08] <rubbishbinge> Izanami is a one time deal. Izanagi is on a 10 year+ cool down.
[4:05:09] <%jake_protagonist> I’m trying to remember if that’s the last power the sharingan specifically gets.
[4:05:14] <@Solidus_113> hush about storm 4 stuff

[4:06:26] <D3rrtyD4n> a gape
[4:06:26] <dundore77> The ones that alter reality and the time loops permanantly lose that eye. If you use it with a Eternal mangekyo sharingan its gone and you no longer get susan. Its not something you can do without being like danzo or tobi and have dozens of spare eyes
[4:06:28] <agenda23> lol
[4:06:29] <djazo> the boss died for this
[4:06:31] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you did nothing wrong Sasuke
[4:06:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Agapedge
[4:06:36] <Fart_Explosions> Each of the mangekyo sharingan abilities are the manifestation of Japanese gods. The god of dreams, god of war, god of the sea, etc.

[4:08:13] <dundore77> other than samurai
[4:08:19] <Arek_1> Shinto progenitor gods.
[4:08:19] <Sp3ctre48> Izanagi was "you didnt win" and Izanami was "I win forever"
[4:08:26] <+krispen_wa> Samurai aren't people
[4:08:28] <Arkhamman367> Okay so Romulus and Remus?
[4:08:31] <lotharrio> The myth is something like... the wife died and the husband did his best to get her back, but she was a zombie and it scared him so he ran away.
[4:08:32] <Shishi1205> samurai not people confirmed by one guy
[4:08:33] <Alzero83> Booo, jojo comparing

[4:11:25] <%jinking79> 50/50
[4:11:26] <Bloodxb> it covers everything after this
[4:11:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Storm 4 covers all the remaining canon
[4:11:28] <Arkhamman367> and more

[4:11:34] <%jake_protagonist> Sort of?
[4:11:35] <Orbeii> storm 4 finishes the story
[4:11:35] <rubbishbinge> Storm 4 is ALL the end iirc
[4:11:35] <trueherobappo> it literally starts with him beating them to a pulp
[4:11:36] <+GreenCMD> you should still watch the kage fight
[4:11:37] <Hentailovr> I am confused, there are no spoiler characters in storm 3 select screen, y'all are high.
[4:11:37] <wendigo172> End of Tobi fight

[4:11:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Did Woolz DO IT?
[4:11:57] <foghornleghorn55> It doesn't show the end of Madara vs the 5 kage
[4:12:00] <%jake_protagonist> You can watch the fight with the kage
[4:12:03] <optimasmaximas> Chat, is the shenanigan the equivalent of the rinnegan to Woolie’s sharingan (the wooliegan)?
[4:12:03] <dundore77> Every fight from the kage fights onwards is worth watching imo
[4:12:04] <+GreenCMD> Five kage vs Madara isn't covered in 4.
[4:12:07] <+JustCallTre> Storm 4 continues the cannon, but, not everything is animated, expect a lot of slideshow cutouts
[4:12:13] <Arblaster_> deidara vs sasuke is a good one too
[4:12:14] <Dragon_Batman> It has the fight but it's not actually done right
[4:12:15] <dundore77> the canon fights at least *
[4:12:18] <dodgy_dingo_> We are woolie's stand
[4:12:19] <agenda23> Storm 4 has shitty still screen cutscenes though

[4:12:20] <CaptainTenshou> when will you play NUNS4?
[4:12:30] <+Vivaciousx3> storm 4 doersnt have kage fight conclusion
[4:12:38] <bsmusic> do you want the episode numbers on twitter @woolieversus ?
[4:12:42] <%hitorio> Woolie needs to get some Ichiraku Ramen up in him
[4:12:43] <masterfire23> @justcalltre the slideshow is mainly dialogue though
[4:12:43] <%generalve> meems
[4:12:44] <Graxe_> Break, and then KI time
[4:12:44] <Arkhamman367> Same
[4:12:45] <DonStylow> Storm 4 covers the final of shipuuden and dlc road to boruto dlc is the transition to the boruto show. But skip the op if you start Storm 4.
[4:12:45] <%Lylliek> When's NUNS4?
[4:12:46] <CozyGUNNA> just read the end of the madara vs the kage fight tbh

[4:13:54] <Arkhamman367> Moobot laying down the law
[4:14:00] <Hentailovr> Chat I am staring at a screenshot of storm 3 character select screen and just like in my memory, there are NO SPOILERS there
[4:14:12] <tookool5678> watch fight with kage.
[4:14:18] <rheviel> nani
[4:14:19] <%VidulaSaix> @Hentailovr Its a character costume
[4:14:19] <%JohnAtDawn> NO
[4:14:20] <Alzero83> No
[4:14:23] <0rond> I wanted woolie to check out the select screen because kabutob gets his own super special character slot 3 times bigger than anyone else which I thought was funny, couldn't recall any spoilers there @chesterr01
[4:14:25] <Jetsfantasy> wut
[4:14:27] <%JohnAtDawn> ITACHI MADE HIM DO IT
[4:14:29] <Malikwest11> other way around
[4:14:30] <+killogram123> no itachi controlled him to release
[4:14:31] <Jayfox82> There are specific characters in the select screen that are spoilers
[4:14:32] <Alzero83> He was Tsukuyomid to Release it
[4:14:45] <kiharakun> itachi made him release them, kabuto is locked in forever
[4:14:48] <%VidulaSaix> Not true Minh
[4:14:49] <tusk_act4> Itatchi make him do it with Tsukuyomi.
[4:14:52] <+killogram123> no wrong itachi8 made him do it
[4:14:53] <spawnzie> I THINK Itachi used tsukuyomi to hypnotize him
[4:14:55] <Jayfox82> Obviously we can’t say those characters
[4:14:55] <Alzero83> Even if Itachi was Released, Izanami is Constant
[4:15:01] <%VidulaSaix> Tsukuyomi controlled Kabuto
[4:15:01] <DaikiWithDaShot> Genjutsu dude
[4:15:02] <Shishi1205> genjutsu
[4:15:02] <NiktenKing> TsYes
[4:15:03] <%damienlunas> @Zombino924 Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:15:04] <Arblaster_> He is in the timeloop until he does whatever itatchi wants him to do
[4:15:04] <Arkhamman367> No
[4:15:05] <+GreenCMD> he used tsukoyomi
[4:15:05] <+MrRabbles> He's locked inside Izanami until he learns his lesson
[4:15:05] <@Solidus_113> @0rond The spoilers exist as other playable characters that weren't in the story, but are still playable fighters
[4:15:05] <lotharrio> Tsukiyomi hypnotized him
[4:15:07] <kiharakun> its genjutsu suggestion
[4:15:07] <%Lylliek> With a second genjutsu i think.
[4:15:08] <%JohnAtDawn> He can while he's in Izunami
[4:15:09] <DaikiWithDaShot> that's what genjutsu does
[4:15:09] <Dragon_Batman> Yea that is why he said Tsukiyomi
[4:15:09] <%Exiliator> With another jutsu
[4:15:11] <+GreenCMD> after izanami
[4:15:12] <+JacknZack27> He was hypnotized into releasing it
[4:15:13] <CozyGUNNA> yes
[4:15:13] <rubbishbinge> Straight up mind control
[4:15:14] <rheviel> hypnosis
[4:15:16] <Orbeii> this is the most confusing part yeah
[4:15:16] <+chesterr01> @0rond lol no biggie
[4:15:17] <NiktenKing> Yes. It was in the anime where Itachi controlled an innocent woman
[4:15:18] <biomegabear> this is the wooliegan
[4:15:18] <Hentailovr> Can someone pm me or something, I am confused, cuz only thing I can think off happened in story mode
[4:15:18] <+CarlosEoM> it's illusion stuff
[4:15:18] <cumurasame> it makes the person very susceptible to suggestions, sort of
[4:15:19] <Sedrelic> you can normal genjutsu that
[4:15:20] <%Exiliator> Jutsu upon jutsu
[4:15:20] <bsmusic> uh, I don't even know on this one
[4:15:21] <+MrRabbles> Details were left out
[4:15:21] <%jazzcrasher> Your gonna find out the answer in 4
[4:15:26] <%generalve> Next time Woolie LUL
[4:15:31] <Dragon_Batman> No he said the signs
[4:15:34] <Arkhamman367> Tsukuyomi controlled his body only during the seals
[4:15:35] <+freezydude> tsukyomi
[4:15:35] <%VidulaSaix> He spoke them
[4:15:37] <Jetsfantasy> Must say it's mind control for now until NUNS4
[4:15:38] <0rond> I wanted woolie to check out the select screen because kabutob gets his own super special character slot 3 times bigger than anyone else which I thought was funny, couldn't recall any spoilers there, just defending myself @chesterr01
[4:15:39] <Shishi1205> he was saying them
[4:15:39] <+freezydude> tsukuyomi
[4:15:39] <%VidulaSaix> Then did them with his hands
[4:15:40] <+GreenCMD> tsukuyomi
[4:15:41] <%JohnAtDawn> He was just SAYING the signs
[4:15:45] <rheviel> watch the fight in anime @woolieversus
[4:15:46] <bsmusic> learned the signs
[4:15:46] <trueherobappo> woolie watch the episodes
[4:15:51] <%VidulaSaix> Kabuto was SAYING the signs and THEN Kabuto did the signs
[4:15:54] <spawnzie> Okay watch it
[4:15:55] <agenda23> The Sharingan can be used for hypnosis
[4:15:57] <NiktenKing> Kabuto told him vocally, then he made Kabuto physically do it
[4:16:00] <bsmusic> yes Reggie
[4:16:00] <+albanio> izanami is like a mind loop, he just used tsukyomi to brain blast him again to release it
[4:16:01] <Arkhamman367> Hand on head was Tsukuyomi
[4:16:02] <Sedrelic> kabuto said the signs...you werent paying atention
[4:16:02] <Andrei11Droasca> He did the signs with his body so it works @woolieversus
[4:16:03] <Shishi1205> mind control
[4:16:07] <Alzero83> Kabuto is caught in a Time Loop of the Mind cause of Izanami that he can never Escape from. Itachi then Genjutsued him to Learn the Release to make him do it @WoolieVersus
[4:16:09] <Jetsfantasy> Only Kabuto can release it, so he controlled Kabuto to release it
[4:16:09] <trueherobappo> the anime will explain it better and show you exactly how he knew.
[4:16:10] <biomegabear> because he was under his control anyway
[4:16:10] <+JacknZack27> He was just saying them out loud. Not doing it yet
[4:16:10] <spawnzie> Itachi was controlling him
[4:16:11] <+texflexrex> Mind control
[4:16:12] <bsmusic> to undo the jutsu
[4:16:13] <+killogram123> he was mind controlled by tsukyomi so he did the signs
[4:16:14] <+jpipeman> After he looped Kabuto, he just genjutsu'd him with Tsukuyomi, a different technique, to make kabuto give the yutsu away and do it
[4:16:14] <%JohnAtDawn> STOP LOOKING AWAY FROM CHAT WHILE ASKING QUESTIONS ONLY CHAT CAN ANSWER
[4:16:16] <+freezydude> Kabuto said the signs because Itachi was controlling him.
[4:16:18] <NiktenKing> Itachi
[4:16:19] <Blackscience91> Kabuto was speaking the signs. Then Itachi made him do those signs
[4:16:20] <shadowsofpain> He used Izanami to trap him in a time loop. Then used Tsukiyomi to extract information and control his body to use the signs
[4:16:20] <%hkarim94> undo the reanimation
[4:16:21] <wendigo172> The anime will explain it
[4:16:21] <lotharrio> Because Itachi controlled him
[4:16:26] <thexiiilightning> Tsukuyomi made him do the signs
[4:16:26] <%VidulaSaix> Itachi controlled him to do it to release the Reanimation and end the war @WoolieVersus He did it via Tsukuyomi hypnosis
[4:16:26] <awildgooseappears> binge watch time
[4:16:27] <Arkhamman367> Tsukuyomi
[4:16:28] <tusk_act4> Yeah, Kabuto told him verbally then Itachi made him do it physically. It was Tsukiyomi.
[4:16:29] <Dragon_Batman> Itachi asked what are the signs to release the Reanimation KAbuto answered, He then made KAbuto make the signs to release the signs using Tsukiyomi after
[4:16:30] <mankeyfigh> Itachi was controlling him
[4:16:31] <zayasu> @JohnAtDawn so frustrating LUL
[4:16:32] <+JacknZack27> He told him because he was mind controled
[4:16:33] <@Solidus_113> Genjutsu
[4:16:33] <DonStylow> Storm 4 explains more about the Time Loop.
[4:16:33] <soapwrecker> Itachi was controlling him with Tsukuyomi
[4:16:34] <Sedrelic> cus genjutsu...genjustsu users can mid fuck easily
[4:16:35] <kiharakun> itachi needed to know the signs to make him do it.
[4:16:35] <Malikwest11> wiki it
[4:16:35] <+CarlosEoM> it's not important
[4:16:36] <biomegabear> YES
[4:16:37] <rubbishbinge> He asked
[4:16:43] <bsmusic> Itachi was helping the alliance
[4:16:44] <+freezydude> Itachi used tsukuyomi to control him
[4:16:45] <NarcissistCactus> hggGuapo

[4:17:09] <Alzero83> Tsukuyomi
[4:17:10] <Jetsfantasy> Tsukuyomi
[4:17:10] <cumurasame> uh arguably a spoiler to answer in detail, but
[4:17:10] <NiktenKing> TSUKUYOMI
[4:17:11] <+MrRabbles> Kabuto told him
[4:17:11] <agenda23> It was hypnosis while he was stuck in the time loop
[4:17:11] <Shishi1205> tsukuyomi his ass
[4:17:13] <soapwrecker> Itachi first extracted info through Tsukuyomi, while Kabuto was under Izanami, then he controlled him.
[4:17:13] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> he made him say it
[4:17:14] <+albanio> tsukyomi

[4:17:18] <trueherobappo> yrs
[4:17:18] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Itachi made Kabuto SAY the signs, then Itachi forced him to do the signs.
[4:17:19] <%senoue> He can look in his mind with Tsukuyomi
[4:17:21] <+Superbro64> kabuto started the reanimation jutsu, so it seema that ONLY kabuto can undo it, so Itachi controlled kabuto @woolieversus
[4:17:21] <+GreenCMD> izanami had him in the time loop, then used tsukoyomi to make Kabuto show him the signs, then Itachi made him do the jutsu
[4:17:22] <dundore77> He made him say it
[4:17:22] <lotharrio> He used Tsukiyomi to hypnotize him and get the information.
[4:17:22] <spawnzie> Tsukuyomi lets him get in his head
[4:17:22] <Arkhamman367> Yes
[4:17:23] <alpharius88> yes
[4:17:23] <trueherobappo> yes
[4:17:23] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Itachi made Kabuto SAY the signs, then Itachi forced him to do the signs
[4:17:24] <NiktenKing> HE MADE HIM TELL HIM THE SIGNS
[4:17:25] <Blackscience91> Yes
[4:17:26] <Sedrelic> -kabuto tell the signs
[4:17:26] <Shishi1205> kabuto told him
[4:17:26] <bsmusic> yes
[4:17:27] <%VidulaSaix> And after that, he used Tsukuyomi to hypnotize him into revealing the signs for the seal, then he used that knowledge to force Kabuto to undo the reanimation @WoolieVersus
[4:17:27] <CozyGUNNA> yee
[4:17:28] <Arkhamman367> Both
[4:17:28] <Blackscience91> YES
[4:17:28] <trueherobappo> both
[4:17:29] <+greenfall> yes
[4:17:30] <Malikwest11> he asked him and he told him
[4:17:30] <thexiiilightning> Genjutsu to make him talk
[4:17:31] <Dragon_Batman> He asked Kabuto what the signs are and he said it verbally
[4:17:32] <%generalve> it's chilly just asks him to break the seal
[4:17:33] <alpharius88> yes eyes are broken op
[4:17:34] <+JacknZack27> He told him to tell him so he did
[4:17:34] <dundore77> he used tsukiyomi and izanami
[4:17:34] <DaikiWithDaShot> Kabuto spoke it to him. it's in the anime as well and it's more clear
[4:17:37] <+Nobara> Kabuto told him with mind control thats the seals kabuto was saying
[4:17:38] <mankeyfigh> made him tell him
[4:17:39] <agenda23> He suggested him to release it
[4:17:39] <%damienlunas> He Genjutsu'd him
[4:17:40] <Arkhamman367> Kabuto doesn't know
[4:17:41] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Itachi made Kabuto SAY the signs, then Itachi forced him to do the signs.
[4:17:41] <awildgooseappears> maybe hes refering to how he get how to controll him
[4:17:42] <rheviel> remember kakashi getting stabbed over and over by Itachi wayyyyyy back
[4:17:45] <shadowsofpain> Itachi used Tsukiyomi after the time loop. Then used the seals to release the reanimation, like a puppet
[4:17:47] <%VidulaSaix> Correct
[4:17:48] <@Solidus_113> The things Kabuto were whispering were the names of the signs
[4:17:48] <soapwrecker> Itachi first extracted info through Tsukuyomi, while Kabuto was under Izanami, then he controlled him.
[4:17:52] <+killogram123> by saying the signs he could cast the jutsu @WoolieVersus
[4:17:52] <+MrRabbles> you were talking while this happened in the cutscene
[4:17:53] <RpgFoLife> Izanami was already in effect from towards the beginning of the fight, Itachi was analyzing him the whole fight I think
[4:17:54] <%jinking79> pretty much
[4:17:58] <NiktenKing> Yes
[4:18:00] <Dragon_Batman> The signs are named like Boar, Rat etc
[4:18:02] <Hentailovr> @WoolieVersus he used tsukuyomi to trick kabuto into telling him the signs. Basically, he probably made Kabuto think war was over or some shit. We didn't see exact illusion he used.
[4:18:02] <trueherobappo> yes
[4:18:02] <Shishi1205> correct
[4:18:03] <rubbishbinge> ye
[4:18:04] <mankeyfigh> Yes
[4:18:04] <spawnzie> yes
[4:18:04] <thexiiilightning> Tsukuyomi = truth serum
[4:18:05] <Arblaster_> yes
[4:18:06] <DonStylow> There is another reason why Itachi used Izanami and Storm 4 tells you why.
[4:18:06] <%ultrasparkseid> yes
[4:18:08] <awildgooseappears> INCEPTION
[4:18:14] <+Nobara> No he made Kabuto say it
[4:18:15] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> forced a confession
[4:18:16] <VanLynx> advanced interrogation
[4:18:18] <bsmusic> @woolieversus remember, you can use genjutsu for information retrieval
[4:18:20] <Jetsfantasy> Yes, he used it for interrogation iirc
[4:18:20] <dodgy_dingo_> Uchiha eye hax
[4:18:21] <lotharrio> He didn't have direct access to Kabuto's brain, he just used Tsukiyomi to put him in a suggestible state and then made him say/do what he wanted.
[4:18:28] <Dragon_Batman> The hand signs have names like Boar and Rat
[4:18:31] <Arkhamman367> Kabuto is the only one who can undo the reanimation justu
[4:18:31] <%VidulaSaix> Thats correct
[4:18:33] <rheviel> interrogation no jutsu
[4:18:34] <Alzero83> Time Loop makes you Comatosed basically @WoolieVersus
[4:18:35] <powerprotoman> woolie he said whats the input and then he made kabuto do the input
[4:18:36] <%VidulaSaix> But thats different reggie
[4:18:38] <Arek_1> Reggie's correct.
[4:18:38] <+Raidou24> Reggie nailed it
[4:18:39] <+killogram123> time loop is just mind loop but the brian is still active and able to be controlled @WoolieVersus
[4:18:40] <+Chosington> NotLikeThis
[4:18:42] <@Solidus_113> Reggie is right
[4:18:43] <DonStylow> Yes
[4:18:43] <+jpipeman> That's a different topic, don't confuse Woolie
[4:18:44] <mankeyfigh> Izanami made him to stop his movement
[4:18:46] <spawnzie> Reggie is right
[4:18:46] <Arkhamman367> Kabuto is the only one who can undo the reanimationjustu
[4:18:47] <rubbishbinge> Yes
[4:18:47] <%VidulaSaix> Reggie is right
[4:18:47] <NiktenKing> YES
[4:18:48] <Arblaster_> Reggie is right
[4:18:49] <NiktenKing> REGGIE
[4:18:50] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Reggie is right
[4:18:52] <+texflexrex> Reggie is right
[4:18:53] <%Exiliator> I guess watching the anime might explain it
[4:18:54] <thexiiilightning> Reggie is right!
[4:18:54] <Jetsfantasy> Reggie has it
[4:18:55] <soapwrecker> no
[4:18:56] <NarcissistCactus> that's a different question
[4:18:57] <Shishi1205> those are different things
[4:18:57] <Andrei11Droasca> He can make Kabuto body do whatever he knew with genjustu @woolieversus
[4:18:57] <Arkhamman367> Reggie
[4:19:00] <+albanio> REGGIE THE GOD
[4:19:00] <awildgooseappears> THen what did itachi learn?
[4:19:01] <Sedrelic> better watch the anime version
[4:19:01] <rubbishbinge> Welllll
[4:19:02] <EndgameContent> It's basically just Ninja Interrogation.
[4:19:07] <Dragon_Batman> He asked how to do a hadoken and Kabuto said 236 Punch
[4:19:08] <%TheDyingPride> Finally calling it a spell
[4:19:09] <DonStylow> Kabuto can only escape the loop until his personality has changed.
[4:19:10] <danknugglit> GET CONFUSED

[4:20:03] <Andrei11Droasca> He mind controlled him to do the justu @woolieversus
[4:20:04] <trueherobappo> You escape the time loop until you figure out who you are and regret what youve been doing yoir whole life.
[4:20:04] <Alzero83> NO
[4:20:05] <lotharrio> Who knows how man loops Kabuto went through?
[4:20:05] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> its not a spoiler because the anime adds filler to explain this in the same episode
[4:20:08] <danknugglit> Were all stuck in izanami
[4:20:10] <Dragon_Batman> Kabuto has no control what so ever
[4:20:17] <+killogram123> no itachi tsukyomied the seals out of him and made him do it
[4:20:17] <%VidulaSaix> Reggie has it 100%
[4:20:18] <Orbeii> no, he was just mind broken and itachi just asks and kabuto answers
[4:20:23] <mankeyfigh> Itachi FORCED HIM
[4:20:25] <awildgooseappears> oh ok
[4:20:25] <+MrRabbles> Reggie knows whats up
[4:20:28] <Arek_1> No, Kabuto fought over and over, getting more salty.
[4:20:28] <lotharrio> Kabuto is half brain dead within seconds, because of folded time.
[4:20:31] <Alzero83> TSUKUYOMI
[4:20:31] <NarcissistCactus> the code
[4:20:31] <NiktenKing> TSUKUYOMI
[4:20:33] <thexiiilightning> Genjutsu
[4:20:35] <Alzero83> Jeezus
[4:20:37] <+jpipeman> Kabuto literally said it out loud
[4:20:37] <%JohnAtDawn> He used Tsukuyomi TWO TIMES
[4:20:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:20:38] <Orbeii> itachi just asks and kabuto tells him
[4:20:38] <powerprotoman> he made him say it out loud with his words
[4:20:39] <Alzero83> ITS STUKUYOMI
[4:20:39] <+wtaguy> @WoolieVersus think of it as torture forcing Kabuto to reveal the code
[4:20:39] <+Kiiper> Kabuto had no control
[4:20:40] <soapwrecker> He learned it through TSUKUYOMI
[4:20:41] <%VidulaSaix> Kabuto said it out loud
[4:20:43] <Dragon_Batman> The signs have names like Rat and Boar
[4:20:43] <+Nobara> its Gold experience Requiem time loop basically
[4:20:44] <Arkhamman367> Tsukuyomi
[4:20:44] <Shishi1205> Hynosis
[4:20:45] <%generalve> HE ASKS KABUTO while he is in the loop
[4:20:47] <Malikwest11> it's not part of the loop
[4:20:47] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> the "code" are just the name of the hand seals
[4:20:47] <+killogram123> @WoolieVersus the words said out loud are required to do the jutsu

[4:21:01] <Memitim> he used tsukyomi
[4:21:05] <%Exiliator> Anime explains it well
[4:21:07] <Orbeii> Yeah this entire fucking thing was confusing, sharingan is bullshit
[4:21:08] <agenda23> This jutsu was made to specifically force izanami users to give up
[4:21:11] <%jazzcrasher> It’s ok man
[4:21:12] <Arkhamman367> he used yomi
[4:21:13] <dodgy_dingo_> Naruto is a lovable disaster
[4:21:14] <+JacknZack27> What the fuck is a sharingan
[4:21:14] <+GreenCMD> anime explains it yeah
[4:21:15] <thexiiilightning> The Forbidden Jutsu of - asking
[4:21:19] <lotharrio> Kabuto was "stuck" in the folded time for nearly an eternity. Itachi asking him seconds later, would be Kabuto being given an out like... 10,000 years later.
[4:21:20] <%jimmytwofeet> WE LOVE YOU ANYWAY WOOLIEZ
[4:21:20] <+KongolComet> woolie is just fconfusing himself
[4:21:22] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Itachi needed to know which seals to command Kabuto to do.
[4:21:23] <rubbishbinge> YOMI MEANS READ
[4:21:23] <+wtaguy> @WoolieVersus it's just torture. Advanced waterboarding
[4:21:24] <@Solidus_113> The repent thing is the backstory of the genjutsu, it's explained more in NUNS4 @WoolieVersus
[4:21:24] <Alzero83> CHAT NO JUTSU
[4:21:25] <%VidulaSaix> LUL
[4:21:27] <bsmusic> stacks on stacks
[4:21:28] <%VidulaSaix> Shenanigan
[4:21:28] <DonStylow> The struggle is, Kabuto is basically immortal and can't die. He has to escape the Izanami or he is in this loop forever.
[4:21:30] <Shishi1205> Genjutsu=hypnosis
[4:21:30] <rheviel> Is a huge genjutsu, he could have tortured the info on Kabuto in the illusion or w/e to get info
[4:21:32] <tygretatsumi> how far are they? im late lol
[4:21:34] <+MrRabbles> hit the books woolie
[4:21:37] <+Nobara> It does whatever the author wants whenever he wants it too
[4:21:38] <+jpipeman> Tsukuyomi is just hypnosis in this case
[4:21:39] <NarcissistCactus> kekkei genkai
[4:21:41] <Andrei11Droasca> He mind controlled him @woolieversus
[4:21:41] <+freezydude> genjutsu is hypnosis.
[4:21:42] <mankeyfigh> JustshutupWoolie
[4:21:42] <Ultimatefool> Sharingan? More like ALLJARGON
[4:21:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Its Izanami
[4:21:45] <+killogram123> genjutsu is hypnosis
[4:21:46] <Alzero83> Maybe Woolie doesnt KNow about Tsukuyomi
[4:21:47] <danknugglit> Don't think about it no jutsu
[4:21:47] <BlackermanZX> Tsukuyomi is the big dick genjutsu
[4:21:48] <thexiiilightning> Tsukuyomi HYPNOTIZES. Like a Truth Serum
[4:21:49] <Shishi1205> Hypnosis woolie
[4:21:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the regret thing is izanami
[4:21:51] <NiktenKing> Ultimate hypnotism. He used Tsukuyomi one an innocent woman in the anime once in the original series
[4:21:52] <+ggbhtg> Tsukuyomi really wasnt explained before this LUL
[4:21:53] <Dragon_Batman> Kabuto wasn't in his full control of himself
[4:21:53] <Arkhamman367> HIS BRAIN
[4:21:54] <%VidulaSaix> Yes
[4:21:54] <+freezydude> it's ALWAYS beem hypnosis.
[4:21:54] <Orbeii> its interrogation hypnosis
[4:21:57] <%generalve> yes
[4:21:57] <kiharakun> @WoolieVersus tsukuyomi forces them through a shit load of mental torture until you release them. kabuto gave it willingly
[4:21:57] <dodgy_dingo_> He sent a little pat inti his brain to crazy talk the code out of him
[4:21:59] <+GreenCMD> tsukuyomi can be used to command Kabuto to perform actions since he's basically half dead
[4:22:03] <Shishi1205> 72
[4:22:09] <%TheDyingPride> Fake time is technically a time loop
[4:22:13] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Itachi needed to know which seals to command Kabuto to do.
[4:22:13] <lotharrio> The information came from Kabuto. Itachi uses the Tsukiyomi to insert an illusion into Kabuto's repeating, endless nightmare, and drew an answer out from it.
[4:22:13] <rheviel> illusion
[4:22:15] <trueherobappo> Genjutsu illusion
[4:22:15] <+IceyCone> tsukuyomi is just fancy hypnosis
[4:22:18] <Jetsfantasy> "Itachi opens his brille and uses a genjutsu to force him to release the Impure World Reincarnation" -Naruto Wiki, Section Kabuto, Subsection Fourth Great Ninja War:Climax
[4:22:19] <0rond> sneaky time
[4:22:20] <Dragon_Batman> KAbuto wasn't trying to stop Itachi after he got hit with the Izanami
[4:22:21] <NiktenKing> YES
[4:22:22] <Andrei11Droasca> Look at the fucking Woolie
[4:22:23] <+JacknZack27> Tsukuyomi lets him control hin
[4:22:24] <rubbishbinge> Yes, turned 3 seconds into 72 hours of stabbo
[4:22:24] <Alzero83> Yes
[4:22:25] <DonStylow> kakashi was traped for 3 days and these 3 days are around 3 sec in the real world.
[4:22:25] <+freezydude> genjutsu has ALWAYS been hypnosis
[4:22:27] <+freezydude> YES
[4:22:27] <thexiiilightning> I can hypnotize you to bawk like a chicken
[4:22:28] <bsmusic> yes
[4:22:30] <+Nobara> it's kinda stupid Woolie don't worry about it too much
[4:22:30] <+killogram123> its always been hypnosi
[4:22:31] <thexiiilightning> Same thing!
[4:22:32] <biomegabear> yes
[4:22:32] <%jinking79> yes
[4:22:32] <mankeyfigh> fake time IS NOT a time loop
[4:22:33] <trueherobappo> yes
[4:22:35] <spawnzie> The thing with Tsukuyomi is that it's "The strongest genjutsu" but what it actually does is VERY unclear @WoolieVersus
[4:22:35] <Arkhamman367> KISHIMOTO
[4:22:36] <+wtaguy> @WoolieVersus it was used for torture in the past
[4:22:38] <NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus HE uses it on a woman during the original series
[4:22:43] <+StrangeCoincidence> who's that guy on the right?
[4:22:43] <+GreenCMD> not tsukuyomi but plenty of genjutsus
[4:22:44] <%VidulaSaix> ^
[4:22:50] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Itachi needed to know which seals to command Kabuto to do.
[4:22:56] <trueherobappo> Flashback filler
[4:22:56] <helidzz> @woolieversus type izanami explanation on YouTube pls
[4:22:57] <+jpipeman> genjutsu could always be used for mind control stuff and Itachi also uses Tsukiyomi that way
[4:23:01] <soapwrecker> YES
[4:23:02] <mankeyfigh> YES
[4:23:03] <Dragon_Batman> Think of it like hypnosis nothing more
[4:23:03] <WanderingSwordsman> naruto and sasuke
[4:23:03] <Jetsfantasy> More or less
[4:23:04] <Shishi1205> like hypnosis
[4:23:04] <trueherobappo> he used it on some cloud ninja
[4:23:04] <NiktenKing> To infiltrate when he was with Kisame
[4:23:04] <+ggbhtg> Woolie only knows of it being used for torture on Sasuke and Kakashi
[4:23:05] <+freezydude> YES.
[4:23:05] <Alzero83> uyes
[4:23:06] <aracon_> yup
[4:23:07] <BearSawed> Its like unlimited torture time
[4:23:07] <Orbeii> yeah its bullshit
[4:23:07] <+StrangeCoincidence> OH MY GOD THAT'S WOOLIE
[4:23:08] <thexiiilightning> Pretty much
[4:23:08] <rubbishbinge> He forced his girlfriend to live out her life with Tsukuyomi
[4:23:08] <spawnzie> pretty much
[4:23:09] <%Lylliek> Yeah mostly.
[4:23:09] <%VidulaSaix> tsukuyomi is essentially interrogation
[4:23:10] <+freezydude> Like hypnosis.
[4:23:10] <+GreenCMD> sort of
[4:23:11] <rheviel> You will learn more about tsukiyomi further in the story
[4:23:11] <mankeyfigh> Yes
[4:23:12] <aracon_> mind control
[4:23:12] <DaBelovedUnderdog> He used it on young sasuke
[4:23:14] <+greenfall> yes
[4:23:16] <Arkhamman367> sort of
[4:23:18] <thexiiilightning> Exactly
[4:23:19] <Andrei11Droasca> Its mind control @woolieversus
[4:23:19] <@Solidus_113> Torture dance for eternity
[4:23:21] <kiharakun> @WoolieVersus tsukuyomi = torturous nightmare until you get what you want. izanami = purgatory until mental change
[4:23:21] <spawnzie> It's just general mind fuck
[4:23:22] <+Nobara> Its kinda poorly explained
[4:23:24] <mankeyfigh> yes
[4:23:26] <DonStylow> Tsukuyomi is like spending time with your wifes parents, it takes forever.
[4:23:27] <cumurasame> you do have to wait a "bit" for it to finish
[4:23:27] <bsmusic> @woolieversus genjutsu is used for info retrieval
[4:23:29] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Itachi needed to know which seals to command Kabuto to do.
[4:23:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Izanami was only used by one other guy, Danzo. it took an Uchiha eye each time, but he kept using it to undo the thing that killed him
[4:23:30] <%jinking79> it just a broken move
[4:23:30] <+GreenCMD> only because of izanami
[4:23:34] <lotharrio> Itachi inserted a Tsukiyomi into Kabuto, which allows him to create a perfect illusion of whatever. In this illusion, he told Kabuto a way out of his living hell of repeating time was to reveal the secrets.
[4:23:38] <austin9568> Like a burning sunrise
[4:23:41] <0rond> @chesterr01 I wanted woolie to check out the select screen because kabuto gets his own super special character slot 3 times bigger than anyone else which I thought was funny, couldn't recall any spoilers there. just clearing my name @woolieversus
[4:23:42] <+killogram123> @WoolieVersus don't google tsukyomi
[4:23:47] <RpgFoLife> He used it on Sasuke in part 1 in the hallway too
[4:23:51] <Arek_1> Brain control. LUL
[4:23:53] <+ggbhtg> Woolie has only seen it used on Kakashi and Sasuke on part 1 everybody @woolieversus
[4:23:54] <Arkhamman367> No that's Kotoamtsukame
[4:23:57] <agenda23> Yagura was mind controlled by Sharingan hypnosis right? Its just a thing the Sharingan can do I think
[4:23:59] <Sedrelic> not a good idea... since the infinite filler
[4:24:01] <alwayspronking> Infinite torture dance will eventually reveal all information from immortal fuckers
[4:24:02] <Orbeii> youre thinking about it more than kishimoto did probably LUL
[4:24:04] <thexiiilightning> But you can tell them to say you something in Vietnamize
[4:24:04] <SetsuRyuu> Woolie do you have NO IDEA what HYPNOSIS means? I'm talking irl even
[4:24:06] <blue6sub6remnant6> "It's maybe not meant to be thought about to this degree" - Woolie the wise, 2019
[4:24:08] <+freezydude> Genjutsu has always been HYPNOSIS.
[4:24:09] <Memitim> in the novels he used it on girl that was in love with him by making her live out her entire life with him and her dying of old age, and the shock of it killed her @woolieversus
[4:24:10] <dundore77> It could have been just any sharingan genjutsu as well. Itachi is the best genjutsu user
[4:24:10] <Dragon_Batman> Yea just asked the person who speaks it how to say a sentence
[4:24:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Tsukuyomi is not Izanami
[4:24:12] <Jetsfantasy> Tsukuyomi can be used to interrogate people for information too
[4:24:14] <+jpipeman> @WoolieVersus they use Genjutsu for mind control with poor justification all the time in this series
[4:24:15] <thexiiilightning> no...
[4:24:17] <thexiiilightning> woolie
[4:24:17] <Arkhamman367> No that's Shisui's Power
[4:24:22] <+StrangeCoincidence> are they talking about fetishes?
[4:24:22] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus remember that the 9-tails was being controlled by the sharingan
[4:24:30] <rheviel> Ino has "mind control" but only body swap since.
[4:24:31] <tusk_act4> @WoolieVersus It is complete mind control basically. Whatever Itachi wants you to experience you will. So Itachi manages to force the undo spell out.
[4:24:33] <Alzero83> You dont need Food
[4:24:33] <+ggbhtg> I hear you Woolie you've only seen it used on Kakashi and Sasuke on part 1 everybody @woolieversus
[4:24:35] <kiharakun> @WoolieVersus essentially he gives whatever suggestion kabuto needed in his mind to NEED to use the jutsu
[4:24:35] <%Tenchi_G> Speak Vietnamese to me
[4:24:35] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> Have fun
[4:24:36] <Alzero83> Kappa
[4:24:36] <+CarlosEoM> enjoy
[4:24:37] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Itachi needed to know which seals to command Kabuto to do.
[4:24:39] <Arkhamman367> No that's Kotoamtsukame
[4:24:42] <%VidulaSaix> LUL
[4:24:45] <Andrei11Droasca> But you can make him speak Vietnamese tho @woolieversus
[4:24:49] <Shishi1205> genjutsu baby
[4:24:50] <%jinking79> get food boy
[4:24:55] <Alzero83> FOOD NO JUTSU
[4:24:56] <Ultimatefool> Madara IS based
[4:24:57] <Novillion> cool stream man
[4:24:58] <Jetsfantasy> It's "I'll explain it later" bullshit
[4:24:58] <Sedrelic> woolie stop drowing in glasses of water
[4:25:02] <%damienlunas> Kishimoto: "It's genjutsu I don't have to explain it"
[4:25:03] <bsmusic> just regular Sharingan genjutsu on that
[4:25:04] <Dragon_Batman> It is as simple as that
[4:25:06] <%Lylliek> Sharingan just gives you super good genjutsu.
[4:25:08] <metaloverlordx> save and remember your question for the next game
[4:25:13] <Doodle_Taco> IZANAMI OR FEED
[4:25:17] <DonStylow> Storm 4 will blow your mind.
[4:25:18] <Malikwest11> the nine tails thing it's just uchiha
[4:25:19] <%DigitalPelican> Remember when the sharingan used to be about just being able to see things more clearly?
[4:25:20] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:25:21] <Orbeii> YEP LUL
[4:25:21] <+MrRabbles> IT SURE IS

[4:25:25] <biomegabear> vaugigan
[4:25:26] <NiktenKing> ITs just that simple
[4:25:27] <thexiiilightning> It's not that unclear tho XD
[4:25:27] <spawnzie> YUP
[4:25:28] <Dragon_Batman> It really is
[4:25:29] <bsmusic> IT JUST WORKS THOUGH
[4:25:31] <+Chronobot> King Crimson stares in anger
[4:25:33] <%damienlunas> YES. There, you got it. Vauge sharigan genjutsu bullshit did it.
[4:25:38] <dundore77> the anime/manga will show explain better
[4:25:38] <+Grayhammatter> it just works
[4:25:39] <dodgy_dingo_> Naruto's fox sage powers are pretty unclear too
[4:25:40] <Arek_1> I did it. LUL
[4:25:41] <+MrRabbles> there are no real answers
[4:25:41] <Orbeii> LMAO YEAH
[4:25:42] <Andrei11Droasca> The real answer is whatever the fuck Kishimoto wants LUL
[4:25:43] <rheviel> it's still unclear and vague
[4:25:43] <lotharrio> The Tsukiyomi threw an illusion into Kabuto's mind while it was endlessly repeating the same events, and basically gave him an out. You can hand wave that there was like... a conversation we didn't see between them where Kabuto agreed to speak the seals in order to alleviate some of his endless torture.
[4:25:44] <+Nobara> Sharingan too OP PLZ NERF
[4:25:46] <%generalve> LOL
[4:25:47] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> LUL
[4:25:49] <+GreenCMD> LAYERS of obscurity
[4:25:49] <awildgooseappears> if the WIKI is unclear then theres no hope
[4:25:50] <Hentailovr> Storm 4 doesn't have dumb adventure mode he could play through it quickly. he should do it soon
[4:25:50] <tusk_act4> The Sharingan can do whatever Kisimoto wants at the moment. It has like 50 powers
[4:25:53] <powerprotoman> woolie your asking questions, theres the problem
[4:25:54] <Shishi1205> WOOLIE SHENANIGANS OR FEED
[4:25:55] <dundore77> You also ask questions that just dont happen in the show like the swapping mangekyo
[4:25:56] <Dragon_Batman> It's alittle bit of both
[4:25:57] <Jetsfantasy> There are missing parts that are spoilers
[4:26:00] <blue6sub6remnant6> "Kishimoto would not want to talk to you." That's right Reggie.
[4:26:03] <austin9568> @chronobot But King Crimson is always angry
[4:26:07] <+Nobara> Wait till you see all the shit the Renigan can do
[4:26:08] <mankeyfigh> @WoolieVersus If YOU know Vietnamese, you can MIND CONTROL Someone else TO DO IT
[4:26:13] <JoeBecomesJoe> It's eye magic that lets you advance the plot in the way you want it to go
[4:26:13] <lotharrio> The Tsukiyomi threw an illusion into Kabuto's mind while it was endlessly repeating the same events, and basically gave him an out. You can hand wave that there was like... a conversation we didn't see between them where Kabuto agreed to speak the seals in order to alleviate some of his endless torture...
[4:26:16] <rheviel> More mechanics will come later
[4:26:17] <Shishi1205> SPEAK

[4:26:34] <austin9568> Believe It!
[4:26:36] <+MrRabbles> One Guy is powerful
[4:26:36] <Dragon_Batman> He said Tsukiyomi in the cutscene
[4:26:38] <Arkhamman367> Kotoamtsukame is lelouches geass
[4:26:39] <+jpipeman> The wiki is useless
[4:26:41] <thexiiilightning> ...
[4:26:42] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Every answer would need a preface of: Here's what you know SO FAR
[4:26:49] <Jetsfantasy> Kabuto's wiki entry has more info
[4:26:50] <Orbeii> lmao
[4:26:51] <dreamchaserhg> The is mostly for if you watched the show already
[4:26:51] <Arkhamman367> Coax
[4:26:52] <%VidulaSaix> It prays upon the weak minded
[4:26:52] <Andrei11Droasca> The wiki sucks
[4:26:53] <dundore77> i think its just sharingan genjutsu that controls. i think thats the actual name of the move
[4:26:55] <%VidulaSaix> LOL
[4:26:56] <Alzero83> GO READ/ WATCH THE ANIME
[4:26:57] <%jinking79> Wrong Wiki
[4:26:57] <kiharakun> its mental suggestion, through torture or trickery
[4:26:59] <Memitim> Honestly the entire thing about Izanami is repenting I don't know why they had to add the 'itachi controlling him with another genjutsu thing" just have Kabuto break it himself lol
[4:26:59] <Alzero83> Geez
[4:26:59] <mankeyfigh> Because fuck you
[4:27:00] <powerprotoman> wiki's the most accurate source of info
[4:27:02] <Dragon_Batman> By asking the guy what going to the bathroom is
[4:27:04] <lotharrio> He had Minh speak it, and then repeated it by rote.
[4:27:04] <wendigo172> The anime explains it
[4:27:07] <0rond> ?
[4:27:07] <biomegabear> The Tsukiyomi threw an illusion into Kabuto's mind while it was endlessly repeating the same events, and basically gave him an out. You can hand wave that there was like... a conversation we didn't see between them where Kabuto agreed to speak the seals in order to alleviate some of his endless torture...
[4:27:07] <+jpipeman> no
[4:27:11] <Malikwest11> think it's a "game short out"
[4:27:13] <+greenfall> the sharingan genjutsu has passive mind control basically
[4:27:14] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Every answer by this part of the story would need a preface of: Here's what you know SO FAR
[4:27:14] <blue6sub6remnant6> One Guy is the only ninja that can open the gate of illusion.
[4:27:14] <mzrx7> NotLikeThis
[4:27:17] <Haarute> i'm losing brain cells
[4:27:20] <%jinking79> that the same wiki Woolie went to learn Eggman
[4:27:23] <Malikwest11> no
[4:27:26] <+jpipeman> Izanami has nothing to do with that
[4:27:26] <helidzz> nope not with izanami
[4:27:27] <muniea3> encyclopediyomi
[4:27:28] <rheviel> tsukiyomi is what he used to get info
[4:27:28] <%VidulaSaix> Same Reggie LUL
[4:27:29] <Blackscience91> In the Cutscene, Itachi literally says, he used Tsukiyomi to get the information and make Kabuto undo the Jutsu.
[4:27:31] <Alzero83> SHUT UP and go Eat, Nubs
[4:27:31] <+Kiiper> Minh is so wrong
[4:27:33] <+killogram123> @WoolieVersus the sharigan has inate hypnosis in it tsukyomi or not
[4:27:37] <Shishi1205> Izanami is just to paralyze
[4:27:38] <biomegabear> the answer to mechanics is watch the anime
[4:27:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[4:27:41] <+freezydude> he used GENJUTSU to get it.
[4:27:43] <+freezydude> SIMPLE.
[4:27:44] <Dragon_Batman> Think of it like, how do you do a hadoken and show me
[4:27:44] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus Every answer would need a preface of: Here's what we know SO FAR
[4:27:57] <+andy199620> stop making
[4:27:58] <Orbeii> LMAO
[4:28:00] <Alzero83> GO EAT
[4:28:02] <powerprotoman> to find the answer play NUNS4
[4:28:03] <agenda23> Oh man what a mess
[4:28:03] <+MrRabbles> He's right
[4:28:05] <awildgooseappears> This stream is stuck in izanami where we perpetually dont get it
[4:28:05] <mankeyfigh> @WoolieVersus Because Tsukiyomi, like any other JUTSUin this anime, is never clearly defined, SO they can do any amount of bullshit that the story asks FOR
[4:28:06] <Alzero83> FOOD NO JUTSU
[4:28:07] <Haarute> naruto watch party let's go
[4:28:07] <NarcissistCactus> he said the signs
[4:28:07] <Andrei11Droasca> Because Rohan helped him Kappa @woolieversus
[4:28:08] <Arkhamman367> Kotoamtsukame is lelouches geass
[4:28:09] <+GreenCMD> OK, Mihn is braindead due to izanami. Itachi then used tsukoyomi to coax a brain dead Mihn to start speaking Vietnamese phrases
[4:28:09] <+LastHazzerd> @woolieversus getting waterboarded for infinity makes you more willing to cooperate
[4:28:11] <rubbishbinge> Izanami broke his mind with a time loop illusion. Tsukuyomi superimposed another illusion to force a situation where that'd happen I think.
[4:28:14] <+MrRabbles> Minh speaks the truth
[4:28:16] <$Noponiz> Hey woolie, it's always fun
[4:28:16] <Alzero83> CHEESA HAMBAGA
[4:28:16] <+greenfall> sharingan has passive mind controll, itachi dosent need to know anything hes mind controlling
[4:28:17] <kiharakun> woolies questions are the real izanami
[4:28:18] <aracon_> go food
[4:28:19] <Solidnick18> yep
[4:28:19] <kevon_the_lord_of_slimes> its alright

[4:28:27] <+albanio> just play NUNS4
[4:28:31] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> At the end of the day Tsukuyomi is a form of Genjutsu which is all brain based lol
[4:28:33] <Solidnick18> good lp
[4:28:33] <Dragon_Batman> Just watch it
[4:28:33] <rheviel> tsukiyomi is big illusions
[4:28:34] <TheWashoutXY> NUNS4
[4:28:35] <%damienlunas> "Itachi stop reanimation jutsu Itachi vs Kabuto [English dub]" 8:20 mark for him releasing the jutsu
[4:28:36] <Orbeii> Sharingan confusing always
[4:28:36] <+GreenCMD> Madara vs 5 Kage too, 4 doesn't cover it

[4:28:59] <Alzero83> NUNS4 not until next uyear
[4:29:05] <$Noponiz> iirc the chapter where this got introduced ended with itachi going "the sharingan hat another ability you dont know about" and me throwing my pc out the window
[4:29:05] <DonStylow> The Sharingan is like the like an Afro American Priest who passive-aggressively tells you how disappointed he is for you not visiting the church.
[4:29:05] <lotharrio> Woolie, if you mind control Minh and tell him to speak a specific sentence in Vietnamese, even if you don't know Vietnamese, Minh does. You could then repeat it verbatim and write it down if you need to.
[4:29:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> look up Izanagi and Izanami
[4:29:10] <NarcissistCactus> hey alright
