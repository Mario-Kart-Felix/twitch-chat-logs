[0:01:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Hi trashman
[0:01:24] <%Exiliator> yeeeeaaah.... LUL
[0:01:34] <chll0ne> NotLikeThis
[0:01:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1336233530779701249?s=20
[0:01:35] <townzzzzz> fighting in a far off world
[0:01:35] <LVL1_Scumbag> Time for the real shit
[0:01:39] <@Menitta> Sephiroth is a fun ass pick
[0:01:39] <kairumustdie> so is Buriki One playable now or is this gonna be another history stream
[0:01:41] <tearfuldevil> nothing exciting happening at all
[0:01:41] <%SuperKirby24> yeyeye
[0:01:45] <Shardlab> An awesome pick
[0:01:46] <+JWalnut> and we get Sephiroth Kirby
[0:01:47] <%gatorafan> We can watch the trailers later :)
[0:01:49] <+chanceyy> sephiroth is in waku waku 7
[0:01:50] <+Declan_8000> That mario screen shot though
[0:01:50] <wohdin> Sephiroth’s in Smash and I have never been more upset for FF news
[0:01:51] <%jiggy_snipe> I suggested a cancel and catch up on work but glad you're here
[0:01:54] <@Menitta> SEPHIROTH KIRBY
[0:01:55] <BigManLugan> disco elysium directors cut with full voice acting!
[0:01:56] <%SuperKirby24> o yah sephiroth kirb too LUL
[0:02:12] <dohrge> Would've rather had tifa if it's a ffvii character
[0:02:20] <dmysta3000> I would have preferred Tifa but I’ll take Sephora
[0:02:21] <%gatorafan> Any nintendo related event that mentions Geno gets C&D
[0:02:24] <GeltonZ> Wow really, Sephiroth? That's...pretty lame really.
[0:02:32] <%Exiliator> That was a vtuber band? wha?
[0:02:33] <+JustToWatch> Fully voiced disco elysium would be a lot easier to stream...
[0:02:36] <wohdin> i would have rather had another character from literally any FF other than 7
[0:02:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> Tell me about Waku Waku 7
[0:02:54] <%ekodrop> WAKU WAKU 7
[0:02:54] <GeltonZ> Bonus-Kun SHOULD have been in Smash, lets be real.
[0:02:56] <%jiggy_snipe> the hype is in this stream
[0:03:10] <LVL1_Scumbag> I wish to hear to good word of Waku Waku 7
[0:03:20] <+SuperKirby24> wai hol up hyper neo geo emulators exist?
[0:03:25] <%ekodrop> stick to your guns
[0:03:26] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:03:30] <%gatorafan> Can we cancel Galaxy Fight and jump to Buriki?
[0:03:33] <wohdin> WW7>FF7
[0:03:45] <%FeelinNifty> no!!!!!
[0:03:55] <%Exiliator> I'm gonna put the vga's right next to the stream, and just pretend youre watching it ok? woolieSPICE
[0:04:00] <%ekodrop> christmas barrels
[0:04:00] <%jiggy_snipe> but Woolie why would you do what everyone else is doing?
[0:04:02] <%gatorafan> Nice Boar :)
[0:04:04] <+JustToWatch> "you don't even have to leave the boat, just pull into the harbor for 30 minutes"
[0:04:05] <@Menitta> who do you actually think will win best fighting game tho

[0:04:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH
[0:05:00] <GeltonZ> Ah yes, the fighter that takes 3 hours to unlock versus mode. Nice. Top pick.
[0:05:03] <%gatorafan> Could Liu Kang defeat Saitama?
[0:05:09] <+Declan_8000> One punch man for glory
[0:05:15] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:05:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> can he beat goku tho?
[0:05:43] <@Menitta> yay

[0:05:57] <b0nes911> seferoth in smash
[0:05:57] <%Exiliator> yay
[0:05:57] <tearfuldevil> i exist, but fightcade is an obnoxious hassle to set up
[0:06:08] <GeltonZ> *salute*
[0:06:12] <GothicLolitaAngel> Yes I’m ready and waiting
[0:06:16] <%gatorafan> Ping ALL the Discords!

[0:08:44] <joshua_42> Aw cool Sephiroth was added to Smash
[0:09:31] <rosemon5001> vga doesnt have reggies fro
[0:09:31] <%Exiliator> Ok hands up people, be honest, who are watching the vga's on another screen? LUL
[0:09:36] <GeltonZ> Tech issues happen to everyone. Remember what happened to Yoshi P.
[0:09:37] <%ekodrop> with the bitrate hell happening on that stream right now, you're probably right
[0:09:41] <joshua_42> I am watching both

[0:12:04] <sunnythedrunk> The funny thing about Sephiroth hype is the 2 days everyone is going to play him cuz online is trash
[0:12:05] <%FeelinNifty> Someone earlier said Sephiroth was in this game too and I thought it was a joke
[0:12:30] <%gitgouda> nah its anime sword time nifty
[0:12:34] <+paladinstarbuster> Arina is BIG WAIFU
[0:12:35] <ashenjuan25> Man Nintendo makes me wanna die
[0:12:43] <@Menitta> this game is REALLY pretty
[0:12:59] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Actually most supers are half circle then forwards. But also EXs.
[0:12:59] <@Menitta> OH THAT THING
[0:13:02] <sunnythedrunk> The animation on this game is clean af
[0:13:04] <townzzzzz> look at that punching bag
[0:13:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont think I actually bought a Nintendo game since wii u era 💀
[0:13:09] <SableS139a> WAKU WAKU MOTHERFUCKERS

[0:13:56] <SableS139a> >tfw Waku Waku 7 was supposed to have a sequel, but you don't know why it was canned.

[0:14:28] <%FeelinNifty> waku waku 7 advent children
[0:14:33] <SomersaultJustice> Doki Doki 8 pls
[0:14:34] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ Hol' up, you serious?
[0:14:41] <%Livelinne> lomAhoy lomAhoy lomAhoy
[0:14:49] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a Yes, I made a lore video we'll watch later and I discuss Shin Waku Waku 7.
[0:14:50] <Super_Voltekka> All the Neo Geo games that weren't made by SNK has great instrumentation
[0:14:55] <%ekodrop> slash got a lot of jiggle happening
[0:15:00] <%baka_sugoi> woolieGASM
[0:15:00] <SomersaultJustice> Waku Waku 7 Z
[0:15:02] <Super_Voltekka> No need for arrangements either
[0:15:06] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a But no I don't know why it was cancelled.
[0:15:10] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ Oh shit. You're doing God's work, my friend.
[0:15:16] <GothicLolitaAngel> Oh you made a lore video for this game nice @geltonz
[0:15:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> I remember playing this and garou on an online emulator in my middle school computer lab. woolieSMUG
[0:15:28] <%TheBensonator_> The sprite work is shockingly smooth, that's real nice
[0:15:35] <SableS139a> Still feels bad though. WW7 has a metric fuckton of heart that helped me fall in love with it.
[0:15:42] <GeltonZ> @GothicLolitaAngel I'm a VERY big fan...or was...I'm a little retired but the fire still burns in my soul.
[0:15:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:16:03] <GothicLolitaAngel> Oh I’m a big fan too still am @geltonz
[0:16:09] <SableS139a> Why does this viola go in so damn hard?
[0:16:27] <@Menitta> this is one of SNK's prettiest games
[0:16:28] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Hara haras are whenever but they're unblockable but have absurd start up.
[0:16:31] <@Menitta> Id say
[0:16:44] <SableS139a> HaraHara's only need one bar, right?
[0:16:49] <SomersaultJustice> Erina: I fight for my friends
[0:16:55] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a Correct, the start time is the trade off.
[0:16:57] <%baka_sugoi> sick color
[0:17:01] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ Gotcha
[0:17:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Engwithan_Elder_God subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! Keep on keeping on.
[0:17:13] <SomersaultJustice> now zone hard
[0:17:23] <townzzzzz> nice theme
[0:17:34] <fernandapsdois> this game has darkstalkers style OTGs
[0:17:43] <Mist3rTibbs> Thanks for the 2020Rivalry @engwithan_elder_god
[0:18:07] <SableS139a> So was there ever a reason as to why gymnast fighters were a popular character design over in Japan during the 80s & 90s. All I know is that there's a bunch of them.
[0:18:21] <fernandapsdois> makes poses readable
[0:18:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> the leotards woolieMIRIN
[0:18:49] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a There are indeed and Japan in general was obsessed with sexy aerobics girls...but honestly it's easy: An outfit that can be considered functional while also showing all dem curves.
[0:19:11] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ Makes enough sense, even if it doesn't do it for me most of the time.
[0:19:23] <%Exiliator> Genious really
[0:19:29] <@Menitta> Political Tank Z
[0:19:37] <SableS139a> Arina's one of the few exceptions I can actually mention by name.
[0:19:49] <BloodiaMK2> I like Politank Z due to how crazy they fight
[0:19:50] <GothicLolitaAngel> I main maruru he’s awesome and adorable
[0:20:02] <Super_Voltekka> I don't ever remember dog police in DTP
[0:20:02] <GeltonZ> Mauru has probably the best Hara Hara.
[0:20:36] <+Chazmosis> I remember the Harahara supers being crazy unsafe
[0:20:54] <%ekodrop> PEE
[0:21:16] <@Menitta> I'm all like [Leonardo Dicaprio point] Saltybet
[0:21:21] <SableS139a> Yeah, all of them have lengthy as hell startup, but they have complete invincibility if you manage to activate your HaraHara.
[0:21:22] <Super_Voltekka> Why is the girl riding Mauru instead of hanging in the background like Arina's friends or Dandy's daughter? Doesn't she know how dangerous this game gets?
[0:21:33] <%TheBensonator_> LUL YEYEYE
[0:21:35] <SableS139a> D u d e
[0:21:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Bow!
[0:21:54] <VyCade> YOU DIDN’T HAVE TO DO IT TO ‘EM.
[0:21:54] <SableS139a> You didn't need to go that far, Woolz. Dude and his dogga are already dead...
[0:21:57] <YakumoYomi> Tesse!
[0:21:58] <@Menitta> thats a podcast title
[0:21:59] <SableS139a> *doggo
[0:22:02] <Kaji04> Police Brutalization
[0:22:03] <Potatoidea> Podcast title ...wait a minute
[0:22:05] <GeltonZ> @Super_Voltekka Maybe Mauru's just too fluffy to let go of?
[0:22:27] <SableS139a> C u t e
[0:22:30] <townzzzzz> throw out them items
[0:22:35] <YakumoYomi> Man...good memories from this game.
[0:22:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> CSB 098: "Meter Burn on a stunned officer"
[0:22:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:22:47] <+Chazmosis> I get Sailor Moon Super Famicom vibes from this stage
[0:22:50] <BloodiaMK2> Did she just
[0:23:02] <Super_Voltekka> Was Mahoromatic being serialized when this game came out?
[0:23:02] <BloodiaMK2> Toss a Daschund?
[0:23:05] <SableS139a> Wasn't Tesse also the first super notable robo-meido? Mahoromatic didn't come out for at least another year or two if I've got my facts right.
[0:23:14] <Potatoidea> When does Tesse use her spell card?
[0:23:18] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Hara Haras are unblockable, Reggie. That's why they have the start up and warning.
[0:23:21] <Super_Voltekka> Cause I'm getting Mahoromatic vibes from Tesse
[0:23:37] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a You know I was thinking about that but...I mean...does Rosie from The Jetsons count? XD

[0:24:26] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ On the western side at least. On the east, it's probably Tesse.
[0:24:26] <%SjoeB89> Did they unlock the Ryu yet?
[0:24:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> wow that camera zooms out far
[0:24:31] <townzzzzz> cry child
[0:24:32] <GeltonZ> Big Tesse Tip: USE THE SYRINGE. That move is stupid good.
[0:24:35] <Super_Voltekka> BibleThump
[0:24:50] <%SjoeB89> Oh shit they did.
[0:24:55] <%ekodrop> dandy j

[0:25:03] <%jiggy_snipe> wow
[0:25:06] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ @Super_Voltekka And it looks like I was right. Waku Waku 7 was 1996 while Mahoromatic was 1998.
[0:25:14] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a Yup
[0:25:16] <%Exiliator> Oh nooo!
[0:25:18] <%gitgouda> reggie i think you mean OH MY GOD!

[0:26:21] <SableS139a> @hassanico2 I mean, pun or not, you're not wrong. HahaThink
[0:26:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Where in hell does Woolz find these games?

[0:27:22] <SableS139a> B A G - U P

[0:28:14] <townzzzzz> dat damage
[0:28:56] <%gitgouda> glorious
[0:29:03] <Super_Voltekka> When I hear Fernandez, I can't think of anything but Mystical Ninja
[0:29:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> That is boss level broken
[0:29:18] <GeltonZ> Well...he IS the boss...
[0:29:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fernandez mirror fight

[0:30:21] <%jetjagger222> the effects on slash's sword are really cool

[0:31:06] <%SjoeB89> So who is Rai supposed to be based on?
[0:31:18] <GeltonZ> @SjoeB89 Just...shonen protagonists.
[0:31:20] <townzzzzz> the "clap" sound
[0:31:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Have you guys ever realized how Guts is stupid OP Kappa
[0:31:31] <SableS139a> Rai's a parody of shounen protags at the time.
[0:31:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah he might lose a leg next chapter but he will win
[0:31:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kappa

[0:33:32] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a Apparently she's his dead adventuring partner's daughter.
[0:33:34] <%SjoeB89> I wish there was an actual anime of this

[0:34:22] <Super_Voltekka> So if Dandy is Joseph, is his daughter supposed to be Holly?
[0:34:36] <SableS139a> @SjoeB89 There was probably some 4-koma stuff in the Gamest MOOK for WW7, but I doubt that there was anything else.
[0:35:09] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a @SjoeB89 There were indeed 4-komas in the mook. Also there's a fan manga collection and a novelization.

[1:26:11] <+wydamn> @WoolieVersus I don't think Pat was talking shit, he said "Woolie is playing some obscure fighting game during the game awards and that might be the most Woolie shit ever.

[1:26:25] <SableS139a> Poor doggo...

[1:27:45] <Blackscience91> Gotcha. What I'm seeing on screen made me ask.
[1:27:54] <Syteal> that font looks so similar to the Grandia logo. I wonder if it is...
[1:27:56] <Super_Voltekka> It's a shame that this and Galaxy Fight's only real ports were as part of a compilation on the Wii that probably sells for 60 bucks now
[1:28:03] <GeltonZ> Galaxy Fight apparently gives you 50% more damage on dashing attacks.
[1:28:22] <SomersaultJustice> Galaxy Fight is on the switch
[1:28:24] <+FlyingJose> yo this song is a catJAM
[1:28:27] <GeltonZ> @Super_Voltekka They got Saturn releases. Galaxy Fight even got a US Saturn release. Waku on Saturn kinda sucks though.
[1:28:28] <+FlyingJose> goddamnit
[1:28:50] <GeltonZ> @Super_Voltekka Also the collection was on PS2, not Wii...but hey we got ACA releases at least on everything now.

[1:29:53] <Bryon_Youngblood> I admit, I'd love to see SNK do a full collection for KOF like they did on PS2 for PS4, 5, and XBOX One and S divided into the different sagas with all sorts of stuff.
[1:30:17] <SableS139a> @silentblast93 Also a massive love-letter and parody of 80s and 90s anime & manga.

[1:46:09] <Super_Voltekka> How many Ed Edd & Eddy quotes can we fit into this chat?
[1:46:11] <sakielsweyr> @somersaultjustice The WHAT
[1:46:13] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a All games have TONS of lore...they just never translate it into English XD
[1:46:53] <GeltonZ> @SomersaultJustice THAT'S what it was! I couldn't remember if it was one hit or 5 seconds for the tournaments.
[1:47:14] <SableS139a> @GeltonZ Jesus Christ, it's Virtual-On all over again. At least Inti lore gets officially translated save for the Gunvolt audio dramas. That's up to the fans.
[1:47:15] <SomersaultJustice> If I remember correctly, you can set the round timer to 5 seconds, so they'd do that and have tourneys for it
[1:47:21] <GeltonZ> Yup. Saturn VS mode for Bonus-kun, Rouwe, Yacopu, and Felden Kryz.
[1:47:22] <sakielsweyr> Profound sadness
[1:47:31] <SableS139a> Fucking Gal-Gun and Gunvolt taking place in the same universe for one.
[1:47:31] <SomersaultJustice> @GeltonZ I mean, 5 seconds is enough for one hit so you're not wrong LUL

[1:49:19] <SomersaultJustice> FREEDOM
[1:49:25] <@Menitta> Can Rugal do his command grab on this stage still
[1:49:26] <GeltonZ> @jetjagger222 Yup. So he's probably Felbachoff.
[1:49:38] <Bryon_Youngblood> The zoom out also gives me vibes of what Art of Fighting and Samurai Shodown did
[1:49:49] <@Menitta> oh this is cool
[1:49:54] <Super_Voltekka> Infinitely scrolling stages before Shuma-Gorath made it cool
[1:49:57] <GeltonZ> The game is GORGEOUS. These background effects are just plain NUTS.
[1:50:26] <GeltonZ> Unfortunately I'm worried if we can actually get another background XD
[1:50:42] <@Menitta> I can really see why this goes with Waku Waku 7
[1:51:20] <Hoarseplay> SLAP BASS YE
[1:51:22] <GeltonZ> OH GOOD
[1:51:34] <townzzzzz> slick back hair

[1:51:50] <GeltonZ> It's him on a bike.

[1:54:07] <SableS139a> Amazonian chicks are just evolved tomboys. Prove me wrong.
[1:54:08] <townzzzzz> big boys
[1:54:11] <SomersaultJustice> what if they announce galaxy fight 2 at the game awards tho?
[1:54:11] <Hoarseplay> Yeah Gunter!
[1:54:15] <Ray326> Ah LOU2 won huh
[1:54:21] <%jiggy_snipe> be honest, does anyone actually care about awards shows?
[1:54:24] <Super_Voltekka> GUNTER! Who said you could fly?
[1:54:35] <GeltonZ> Gonna be honest...I think there might be a link between Ggunter and an old Sunsoft platformer but I need to look deeper.
[1:54:49] <chll0ne> @jiggy_snipe no theyre all popularity contests anyways
[1:54:53] <Hundkain> just the announcements, and they've been pretty wack anyways
[1:55:01] <SableS139a> @jiggy_snipe Only some of the games that are announced there. Other than that, there's not much about the awards that really hold anyone's long-term interest.
[1:55:15] <Hoarseplay> Not to derail here, but does Woolie know about Street Fighter 2 MIX?
[1:55:15] <%jiggy_snipe> and we can catch a cliff notes of all the announcements later anyway
[1:55:16] <Bryon_Youngblood> Is it me, or does Gunter seem like design-wise that he would be an Unga Bunga character?
[1:55:23] <+Rekinsinn> holy shitttt why have i never heard of this
[1:55:29] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Hoarseplay What is that?
[1:55:51] <majinken> Unga Bunga?
[1:55:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1336233530779701249?s=20
[1:55:54] <GeltonZ> @Rekinsinn Probably because the AI is too good so it's super un-fun single player! XD Not even kidding. The AI is evil.
[1:56:01] <townzzzzz> some kind of miner bot
[1:56:32] <SomersaultJustice> I forgot, does this game have low life supers?
[1:56:40] <GeltonZ> I...think Musafar actually has a human head inside of him. I need to check the guide but he looks pretty tragic.
[1:56:41] <Super_Voltekka> Is there any connections between Waku, GF, and the NES Batman game?
[1:56:43] <Hoarseplay> @Bryon_Youngblood It's a mob of SF2 that adds dashes, short hops, super jumps,EX moves, guard break, and new moves for all the characters.
[1:56:46] <Bryon_Youngblood> @majinken From what Google said, Unga Bunga characters tend to apply pressure and when they get it, they dominate, but they're kinda dumb, like gorillas, which is where the idea comes to mind.
[1:56:51] <GeltonZ> @SomersaultJustice Don't think so.
[1:56:56] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Hoarseplay Someone do this on MUGEN?
[1:57:11] <Hoarseplay> @Bryon_Youngblood Nope. It's a rom mod.
[1:57:21] <townzzzzz> ded
[1:57:21] <GeltonZ> @Super_Voltekka Not that I know of but maaan you never know...
[1:57:28] <%jiggy_snipe> Leo in GG, Charlotta in GBFV are unga bunga characters examples
[1:57:31] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Hoarseplay OK, now I wanna see if I can find footage of it on YouTube!
[1:57:41] <%jetjagger222> you just blew him up dude
[1:57:50] <Bryon_Youngblood> @jiggy_snipe I know a guy I've watched, Aphex Arcade, has said he sees Chrom from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as Unga Bunga
[1:57:56] <GeltonZ> The G. stands for Golden.
[1:58:04] <majinken> @bryon_youngblood ah thanks man
[1:58:04] <%jetjagger222> kazuma kiryu
[1:58:08] <SomersaultJustice> watch them pick all around roomi
[1:58:18] <Super_Voltekka> I remember seeing tournaments of this from Game Center Mikado where they set the timer to 01, and the first player to get a hit wins
[1:58:19] <%jiggy_snipe> @Bryon_Youngblood yea, I feels like Smash is full of unga bunga chracters
[1:58:27] <GeltonZ> Oh that sounds like a counter.
[1:58:37] <townzzzzz> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:58:42] <SableS139a> Oh shit
[1:59:06] <Bryon_Youngblood> Kazuma's stomp reminds me of a very different version of Bison's Head Press.
[1:59:11] <Super_Voltekka> They were really fun tourneys
[1:59:52] <majinken> yeah they were
[1:59:57] <Bryon_Youngblood> Also, am I the only one he gets some vibes of guys like Duck King, Black Baron, or Blacker Baron for G. Done?
[2:00:33] <GeltonZ> This stage is a Versus Mode exclusive stage which is why it always shows up for the first VS match.
[2:00:51] <%SjoeB89> Did they meet Bonus Kun in this game yet?
[2:00:54] <Hoarseplay> @Super_Voltekka Reminds me of the "nice chinchin" tournament on Million Arthur some years back. Gimmick tournaments are rad and there should be more of them.
[2:01:05] <GeltonZ> @SjoeB89 Not yet since they're doing Versus.
[2:01:49] <SableS139a> DAMN SON
[2:02:06] <majinken> damn he eno
[2:02:15] <majinken> emo..
[2:02:16] <Hoarseplay> G.Done has a seppuku blood attack like Sawada.
[2:02:30] <GeltonZ> I just realized...this means...I thinkG.Done would thus ALSO be related to Fernanez...oh man I need to check the lore on that XD
[2:02:36] <Hoarseplay> Don't remember if it was removed in the USA version.
[2:02:50] <SomersaultJustice> yeyeye roomi
[2:02:52] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Hoarseplay Even though it's more like flames and such too for Sawada's EX version of his seppuku move XD
[2:02:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:02:54] <%SjoeB89> Is bonus Kun playable in this one?
[2:03:05] <Hoarseplay> @SableS139a Tons of Japanese arcade games used to have little miniature books that contained lore on the setting and characters called mooks that never get translated.
[2:03:06] <Super_Voltekka> Doggo simps represent
[2:03:09] <GeltonZ> @SjoeB89 Only in Versus on Saturn and he sucks a LOT more here.
[2:03:24] <SomersaultJustice> dat alex dive
[2:04:02] <SableS139a> @Hoarseplay Oh I would know. I've got a bunch of Virtual-On books, some Fighting Vipers & Fighters Megamix ones, and scanned copies of the Gunvolt & Darkstalkers books.
[2:04:05] <Hoarseplay> I forgot Roomi has that Tiffany Groovy Knuckle tech.
[2:04:24] <SableS139a> I love this shit, but it always hurts that most, if not all of it will never come over here officially.
[2:04:42] <SableS139a> Hell, most of the shit I have is long out of print.
[2:04:43] <Hoarseplay> Man. I need to play Project Justice some more.
[2:05:03] <Super_Voltekka> And the only places that these scans get posted on is Exhentai
[2:05:09] <%jetjagger222> man that's a 90s-ass haircut on alvan
[2:05:11] <GothicLolitaAngel> Yeah PJ is fun @hoarseplay
[2:05:40] <Bryon_Youngblood> Some of Roomi's movements remind me not just of characters like Felicia, but a bit of Mignon from KOF Maximum Impact.
[2:05:41] <Hoarseplay> @SableS139a Sick. I was never into collecting artbooks, but I've seen so many twitter thrads on concept art.
[2:05:51] <SomersaultJustice> her jump forward sounds like kirby floating
[2:06:12] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Hoarseplay Rival Schools is a cool franchise by Capcom that needs more love. Glad to see Akira is gonna appear in Street Fighter 5, but I'd like a new Rival Schools.
[2:06:30] <Hoarseplay> @Bryon_Youngblood Mignon really does have Roomi energy.
[2:06:38] <%jetjagger222> DAMN
[2:06:41] <SableS139a> It's an expensive hobby, but being able to find this kind of stuff and see it all in full is always wonderful. There's still one Operation Moon Gate guide I wanna nab, but I've never been able to find it on an English site.
[2:06:47] <%Exiliator> I GUESS WOOLIE MADE THE RIGHT MOVE AFTER ALL LUL
[2:07:24] <Hoarseplay> @Bryon_Youngblood We'll need to waid until Capcom hires someone who desperately wants to make a new Rival Schools like Ono did with Street Fighter 4.
[2:07:34] <SableS139a> On the other hand, I got my hands on an old Lilith Aensland doujin game during the summer. 11 years out of print since the full version of Lilithrottle only was only sold physically during Comiket 78.
[2:07:40] <+nanaki_ff14> This game look ssooo slick
[2:07:58] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Hoarseplay Definitely. I admit, besides Akira, I'd love to see Batsu, Kurow, Tiffany, Hyosuke, Roy, and Yurika return from Rival Schools and appear in Street Fighter.
[2:08:15] <%jiggy_snipe> wait did Elden Ring not get shown at the awards?
[2:08:21] <+nanaki_ff14> nope
[2:08:32] <%jiggy_snipe> the fan base has fully gone hollow
[2:08:50] <Hoarseplay> @SableS139a I'm always terrified of messing up the pages on artbooks. So I still have untouched artbooks on some of the special edition games I own.
[2:08:57] <+nanaki_ff14> Who needs Elden Ring when we have the new Bandai Namco anime game psaDogchamp
[2:08:59] <bazz_tv> So what does the G stands for?
[2:09:05] <SableS139a> @Hoarseplay Shit, you too my dude?
[2:09:05] <+FlyingJose> g
[2:09:09] <%Ecchigun> g for GOOD
[2:09:12] <+spardanwarrior> Elden Ring won most anticipated game. That was the ONLY mention of Elden Ring.
[2:09:15] <%FeelinNifty> git 'er
[2:09:17] <townzzzzz> he a G
[2:09:17] <Hoarseplay> @bazz_tv Get'r
[2:09:20] <%jetjagger222> g-rated
[2:09:38] <Super_Voltekka> G.Donedam
[2:09:41] <+FlyingJose> HOLY SHIT
[2:09:49] <+nanaki_ff14> Space Ryu!
[2:09:55] <%jetjagger222> the announcer kinda sounds like duo from gundam wing
[2:09:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:09:57] <SableS139a> God, that bass can slap me
[2:10:08] <GeltonZ> @bazz_tv Official the G stands for Golden
[2:10:10] <Hoarseplay> @SableS139a Oh yeah. So much so that I'm considering buying a scanner just so I never have to touch them.
[2:10:12] <+FlyingJose> We need more Sol vs. Ky intros
[2:10:12] <gamewarden92> Hey, coming in from the game awards, it sucks.
[2:10:14] <@Menitta> And now Woolie's view count rises now that the game awards are over
[2:10:16] <@Menitta> lmao
[2:10:18] <SomersaultJustice> oh, they're remaking ghosts and goblins
[2:10:22] <Bryon_Youngblood> We need Arc Sys to consider a new Double Dragon fighting game since they own the rights to Double Dragon now.
[2:10:45] <SableS139a> @Hoarseplay I'm not sure if I could ever do that to my books. I don't have the heart for it.
[2:10:46] <Bryon_Youngblood> @SomersaultJustice Last new G&G Capcom did was Ultimate Ghouls 'n Ghosts on PSP. And that was a WHILE back.
[2:10:49] <ThatGuyThere03> VGA's are over, Sony rigged it big time
[2:10:53] <+Freddy_Millz> Man, I miss old SNK
[2:11:02] <+ManOfReason> @menitta shhh, don’t out me like this LUL
[2:11:10] <+nanaki_ff14> @Menitta we need a palate cleanser with some good ol couch fighting games after that
[2:11:11] <PrideOfFiddles> Yoo that's hype
[2:11:12] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[2:11:16] <@Menitta> lmao
[2:11:20] <SableS139a> DASH-THRUS
[2:11:24] <SableS139a> THE TECH
[2:11:29] <%Exiliator> Woolie wins, he predicted everything
[2:11:37] <Bryon_Youngblood> Rolf'
[2:11:46] <+Freddy_Millz> oof
[2:11:52] <Bryon_Youngblood> Sorry, Rolf's kick there makes me think of how Ryu does Tatsumaki Senpukyaku in Street Fighter EX.
[2:11:52] <%Ecchigun> we got a match
[2:11:58] <+nanaki_ff14> Run it back!
[2:12:08] <%UpgradeScalzo95> UpgradeScalzo95 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[2:12:10] <+Freddy_Millz> yal both threw down on that 1
[2:12:21] <+HotBloodedHero> Yo Woolie I congratulate you on choosing to not waste your time. You win.
[2:12:32] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Every character has a stage. It's just the first time two characters fight in Versus it always goes to the Versus exclusive stage.
[2:12:32] <Hoarseplay> @SableS139a Lilithrottle? Good name. Collecting out of print doijin sounds like quite a hobby.
[2:12:36] <%jetjagger222> we saw the greatness of bonus-kun
[2:12:39] <+ar4ndomblackguy> the most anticipated for nothing...
[2:12:45] <SomersaultJustice> is there a full list for capcom arcade stadium anywhere?
[2:13:00] <Hoarseplay> @UpgradeScalzo95 Thanks bud.
[2:13:33] <%jetjagger222> he's got captain commando vibes
[2:13:38] <Super_Voltekka> R O L F
[2:13:48] <%UpgradeScalzo95> do combo
[2:14:07] <+Freddy_Millz> LIFT OFF
[2:14:18] <Hoarseplay> @GeltonZ Wait, so is it Golden Done, or Gold Done?
[2:14:23] <berasite> oh god i read that name wrong, i got confused
[2:14:28] <SableS139a> @Hoarseplay It's fun too. Kinda hard to get into if you wanna go for 100% or the highest score, but it's strangely blissful when you get used to flying. Found the full C78 release on Ebay back in either April or May and copped out 50 bucks for the last copy when I was on another Darkstalkers high.
[2:14:29] <+Freddy_Millz> Get'r
[2:14:37] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay Golden Done...cripes you're right it WOULD have made more sense the other way.
[2:14:38] <Bryon_Youngblood> Seeing the trailer to Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection... man, it looks like it runs smoothly :D
[2:15:03] <+nanaki_ff14> Thats a Chun Li there
[2:15:19] <+Joe2187> Dragon Dab
[2:15:29] <GeltonZ> He's a lizard man made of ROCKS.
[2:15:43] <Hoarseplay> @SableS139a Flying? It's a shmup?
[2:15:45] <+ManOfReason> Are all Juris kick girls? 🤔
[2:15:55] <Hoarseplay> @GeltonZ YO WHAT?
[2:16:09] <BloodiaMK2> Wait... This is where Dad Gunter is from?
[2:16:13] <BloodiaMK2> Nice
[2:16:16] <SableS139a> @Hoarseplay Score attack action game where flight's the main means of attacking and getting around quickly.
[2:16:51] <SableS139a> Lilith has grounded normals too, but they suck compared to her NiGHTS-esque Drill Dash.
[2:16:53] <+Freddy_Millz> Jaguar KNEE
[2:16:58] <Hoarseplay> @SableS139a Ah, one of those types.
[2:16:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:17:10] <BloodiaMK2> @Reddemon4 You
[2:17:17] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay That's why he turns grey when he blocks, his skin turns to stone.
[2:17:22] <BloodiaMK2> That's is hell you're walking into
[2:17:24] <Hoarseplay> @SableS139a Is it good?
[2:17:40] <+Freddy_Millz> oof
[2:17:41] <%Ecchigun> YOOOO
[2:17:45] <townzzzzz> that spacing
[2:18:11] <bazz_tv> Is Gunter's tackle a charge input?
[2:18:14] <%Ecchigun> give Chirithy Juri and he'll win everytime
[2:18:27] <SableS139a> @Hoarseplay For what it is, it's pretty damn fun. Also the last game made by a doujin studio known for pumping out a lot of fun games. MOUNT☆PUNCH.
[2:18:48] <Hoarseplay> @SableS139a Noted. I'll look into them.
[2:19:20] <townzzzzz> LUL
[2:19:28] <%Ecchigun> yo the axe kick
[2:19:31] <+Freddy_Millz> got her under control now!
[2:19:31] <%Ecchigun> is super strong
[2:19:33] <%jetjagger222> the rushdown is real
[2:19:53] <gamewarden92> Did Hades get like 1 thing?
[2:19:58] <%cylish> cylish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! You made the right choice tonight guys, the awards were lame
[2:20:06] <bazz_tv> Gunter looks like a Draconian from Dragonlance
[2:20:11] <BloodiaMK2> Very lame
[2:20:20] <SableS139a> @gamewarden92 One or two awards I think. It scored best action game this year. That much i do know.
[2:20:20] <+Freddy_Millz> LETS GO!!! Get in that ass Juri!
[2:20:21] <BloodiaMK2> Bugsnax got shafted
[2:20:21] <Bryon_Youngblood> @cylish Sounds like it's just about The Last of Us 2, as if it's that good for some of the shit i've heard regarding it. XP
[2:20:28] <Bryon_Youngblood> But I'm mostly for any reveals.
[2:20:38] <%Ecchigun> this stage is nice
[2:20:41] <%jiggy_snipe> oh cool
[2:20:42] <%jetjagger222> man this stage
[2:20:48] <SableS139a> This stage KICKS
[2:20:50] <%cylish> The reveals weren't even that great, and Hades got robbed
[2:20:54] <%barkon345> What is this game it looks godlike
[2:20:58] <%jetjagger222> fucking neogeo games man
[2:20:59] <%Ecchigun> thats 100% a salty bet stage i hope
[2:21:00] <Hoarseplay> Ay, characters even get a palette change
[2:21:03] <townzzzzz> wide open wet stages are cool
[2:21:05] <GeltonZ> @barkon345 Galaxy Fight
[2:21:05] <Hoarseplay> @barkon345 Galaxy Fight
[2:21:13] <bazz_tv> Galaxy Fight
[2:21:15] <Hundkain> wanna see that one stage with the ruins and the lightning
[2:21:19] <Bryon_Youngblood> Looks cool here thought. :D
[2:21:19] <+Freddy_Millz> That dont even try to make games like this anymore
[2:21:27] <Nuclearcherries> Game of the Year awards were a trainwreck
[2:21:32] <laguerrilha> Yo who is that cutie and why she got the same name of my wifu :O
[2:21:36] <%jetjagger222> even the BGM is going in
[2:22:05] <%SjoeB89> Another Kick queen like the SF Juri
[2:22:11] <+ManOfReason> The camera movement is kinda nuts in a good way
[2:22:13] <+Freddy_Millz> she such a goon
[2:22:24] <%Exiliator> Coolgame
[2:22:36] <Victory_Boss> Killers coming out of the walls
[2:22:41] <Hoarseplay> @Freddy_Millz There are a ton of gems in the experimental fighting game era of the mid-90s to early-aughts. Before there was a solid consensus on what a fighting game was.
[2:22:53] <%jiggy_snipe> sounds like it would have been sick
[2:23:03] <oldwest1234> Evil Dead game was announced if ya'll haven't heard, seems like it's gonna be co op as well
[2:23:05] <%SjoeB89> Hey woolie Bonus Kun is in that game too.
[2:23:11] <laguerrilha> Another kick girl called Juri Kreygasm
[2:23:14] <GeltonZ> @SjoeB89 He knows! He saw.
[2:23:17] <SableS139a> Shin Waku Waku 7 would've been amazing. I'm still upset it never came to be.
[2:23:18] <%Exiliator> You did yes
[2:23:25] <TheWashoutXY> sounds good
[2:23:25] <townzzzzz> your dip switch
[2:23:27] <+Freddy_Millz> beeeeeeeeeeeeep
[2:23:29] <%kulmoth> woolieU woolieU
[2:23:30] <%Struggleful> Shit's fucked
[2:23:32] <+MrAtheGreat> That Smash Bros annoucement was pretty hype tho
[2:23:33] <SableS139a> beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
[2:23:35] <%SuperKirby24> gotta blow on the cartridge again
[2:23:39] <Victory_Boss> that bass tho
[2:23:43] <%jiggy_snipe> but Waku Waku 7 and Gel's lore vid were lit
[2:23:47] <Naleb> yeah modern gaming is depressing
[2:23:49] <%cylish> thats fair
[2:23:49] <Bryon_Youngblood> @MrAtheGreat Yeah! I had no idea about Sephiroth
[2:23:50] <+MrAtheGreat> You missed the CUMputer ad

[2:24:26] <%Exiliator> I had way more fun watching Woolie'n'Reggie reacts to waku waku lore honestly
[2:24:30] <%Superbro64> that guitar lick is going IN
[2:24:32] <Bryon_Youngblood> @MrAtheGreat You're damn right it was :) And nice to see more villains too in Smash'

[2:28:59] <+gustavozxd> Juri
[2:29:11] <GeltonZ> @AlteisenReiseZ You missed the Waku Waku 7 lore hour. Hope he keeps it in the YouTube version :B
[2:29:13] <%jetjagger222> dat alt palette though

[2:30:26] <%jetjagger222> that's some streets of rage shit in the background
[2:30:30] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @GeltonZ Ahhh
[2:30:50] <Hammatime8> Okay, how MASSIVE is that traffic light in the background?

[2:33:41] <fangovafang> @theotrainwreck i saw it too lol folks is losin they minds
[2:34:05] <jorniev> Thinking woolie made the right choice tonight
[2:34:18] <Bryon_Youngblood> Sephiroth is a good choice not just for popularity, BUT also because he gives a pretty cool villain to the mix.
[2:34:28] <Bryon_Youngblood> And Smash could always use more villains.
[2:34:33] <Hammatime8> I wanna dig Kazuma's design but something isn't doing it for me
[2:34:42] <theotrainwreck> @fangovafang was sitting 3 feet away from my friend whos a massive ff7 mark and he actually screamed "LETS FUCKING GO" and now I'm deaf
[2:34:47] <SomersaultJustice> I'm honestly more excited for more ff7 music lol
[2:34:48] <%Sol_Install> man... sephiroth...
[2:34:51] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Every time you play Versus, the first match is ALWAYS at the Versus exclusive stage.
[2:34:54] <%Sol_Install> that was a bummer for me tbh
[2:34:58] <%jetjagger222> @Hammatime8 he's kinda like space hanzo without the scarf
[2:35:03] <NoireRequiem> @Bryon_Youngblood I agree, especially about the music. I hope square puts some music in this time
[2:35:09] <%Sol_Install> it's another villain which is nice
[2:35:21] <Bryon_Youngblood> @NoireRequiem Me too, especially after how STRICT they were with Cloud it felt like.

[2:35:32] <%SjoeB89> Is there a cheat to unlock Bonus Kun in this game?
[2:35:46] <Super_Voltekka> The one-second tourneys at Mikado are kino

[2:41:51] <SomersaultJustice> does the aca version of this have 3P or 3K mappings?
[2:42:01] <%swordmanegill> This is very wierd for me. Cause I never play fighting games but I'm making one. I got into making a fighting game cause it's a good excuse to animate a lot.
[2:42:15] <%SjoeB89> Are desperation moves in this health based?
[2:42:28] <Hoarseplay> Fightcade has those binding options at the bottom.
[2:42:32] <GeltonZ> @SjoeB89 Pretty sure it doesn't have desperation moves
[2:42:55] <T_Sasquatch> Sigh woolie was right to not watch the vga

[2:44:32] <%jetjagger222> man they did a real good job making those kicks look powerful
[2:44:40] <%SjoeB89> Or maybe I'm remembering another game.

[3:16:48] <Darren716> nope
[3:16:49] <+WorldsBestPanda> He didn't miss shit.
[3:16:50] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay That's YOUR job! I know nothing about these!

[3:17:11] <Hoarseplay> Kouhatsu had a Buriki One tournament less than a week ago.
[3:17:50] <zakaraz> why are all these background assets on the top layer?
[3:17:51] <+BlackMegaMan> I have to admit the concept of an arcade-y MMA based fighting game really does interest me
[3:17:52] <NiktenKing> just got here, what's up with that background layering
[3:18:03] <townzzzzz> LUL
[3:18:04] <%RyuuAoi> @niktenking Scrublords
[3:18:06] <DatAsuna> It was pretty sick that they announced the new smash fighter was david cage from indigo prophecy
[3:18:13] <Hoarseplay> @zakaraz Because the game doesn't emulate wel.
[3:18:23] <%jiggy_snipe> so do you play this cross hand on an arcade stick?
[3:18:23] <NiktenKing> ah I see,its one of THOSE games.
[3:18:25] <%Exiliator> The completely muted fighting is very eerie
[3:18:28] <deafmelone> This game deserves love man
[3:18:34] <bluebeardbby> This feels oddly unsettling with the silence and all
[3:19:08] <%RyuuAoi> REGGIE, CONFIRM
